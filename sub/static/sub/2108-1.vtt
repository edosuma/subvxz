01:43.537 --> 01:45.704

  eating breakfast right now.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.612

02:38.192 --> 02:40.826
it's well-done.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.497

02:45.499 --> 02:48.534
           -mnh-mnh.
    kevin get back in ... oh.

02:50.470 --> 02:52.671
         -hey, archer.
         yeah, listen.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.707
    so, specimen 22 and 23,
         what happened?

02:55.709 --> 02:58.010
             right.
 no, but what i'm saying is...

03:18.398 --> 03:19.665
       -no, i understand.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.366
the whole sequence is messed up.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.035
we're gonna have to go back in.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.304
 i-it ... it's just not working
           right now.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.672
-oh, y... w... are you gonna eat?

03:26.674 --> 03:28.407
        here, take this
      in the car with you.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.343
   -exactly right, all right.
    -you forgot your coffee.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.045
      kevin, get in here.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.713
        -but i'm looking
  at the same things you are.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.981
        -yes, all right.
           -exactly.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.649
    so if you look at 48-c,

03:37.651 --> 03:42.354
        i really believe
    it's a whole new way...

04:09.949 --> 04:11.583
          -all right,
  what do ... what do you mean?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.518
- listen, work back, right?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.354
  -all right, which sequence?

04:21.695 --> 04:23.028
 -work backwards from the goal.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.630
       so if we're trying
        to achieve a ...

04:24.632 --> 04:26.431
 -yeah, no, we need to have you
            come in.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.699
10:00 a.m. now?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.635
       no, i'll be there.
         i'll be there.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.336
   -that's good. that's good.

06:44.338 --> 06:45.937
        all right. okay.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.340
i'm gonna let you go now, okay?

06:48.342 --> 06:50.175
    all right, here we are.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.444
             okay.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.482
        all right, good.

07:45.665 --> 07:50.302
   you remember any of this?

07:50.304 --> 07:52.437
              hmm?

07:52.439 --> 07:54.473
          that's okay.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.476
     you hit the windshield
     at 36 miles per hour,

07:57.478 --> 08:00.278
   and you've been in a coma
         for two weeks.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.849
       so, truth be told,
        we're very lucky

08:03.851 --> 08:08.353
   to have you here, alive ...
       breathing, at all.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.357
         -a car crash?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.659
     -yeah, you hit a tree.

08:14.661 --> 08:19.097
    you swerved into a tree.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.600
      -where's the doctor?

08:21.602 --> 08:23.935
           -they said
   it would take a few weeks

08:23.937 --> 08:25.837
 to get your full memory back.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.439
 they said the best thing to do

08:27.441 --> 08:29.508
         would be just
    to walk you through it.

08:29.510 --> 08:34.880
    so i figured we'd start
    at the beginning, okay?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.482
     -where are we in that?

08:38.485 --> 08:42.854
    -nags head, early '70s.

08:42.856 --> 08:47.025
 we used to go there two months
      out of every year...

08:47.027 --> 08:50.128
 before our father passed away.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.631
 that happened when we were 12.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.065
         heart attack.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.901
 he was the picture of health,

08:55.903 --> 08:58.803
    and he just dropped dead
      running one morning.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.409
i'm sorry.
       it's ... i'm sorry.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.811
       it's like my life
        never happened.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.881
    i just don't understand.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.985
            my head,
   it ... it just feels empty.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.022
           i'm sorry.

09:17.024 --> 09:21.192
          -it's okay.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.461
             here.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.400
    uh, we used to eat these

09:28.402 --> 09:31.169
     when we were children.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.905
   our mother fed them to us

09:33.907 --> 09:37.142
          after we had
    our wisdom teeth pulled.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.848
     -is our mother alive?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.186
              -no.

09:55.194 --> 09:59.297
    that ice-cream sandwich
    is not gonna eat itself.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.966
           you should
     take a bite out of it.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.634
        it's very good.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.771
    you want to hear a joke?

10:06.773 --> 10:09.240
         knock, knock.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.476
         -knock, knock.

10:11.478 --> 10:15.413
  -when i say, "knock, knock,"
you reply to me, "who's there?"

10:15.415 --> 10:17.749
         -who's there?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.451
         -that's good.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.787
              boo.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.056
             -boo?

10:25.058 --> 10:29.160
      -you say, "boo who?"

10:29.162 --> 10:31.129
           -boo who?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.098
          -don't cry.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.900
       it's just a joke.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.148
i understand.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.083
           i got it.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.324
       -it's just a joke.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.928
           i got it.

11:15.608 --> 11:20.779
-you've been married nine years,
      separated for four.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.682
    -does she know i'm okay?

11:23.684 --> 11:25.350
         -i don't know.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.852
         -where is she?

11:27.854 --> 11:29.154
         where is she?

11:29.156 --> 11:31.156
    -i honestly don't know.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.559
     you've been separated
       since kevin died.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.960
            -kevin.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.530
      -you remember kevin.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.466
      he was 6 years old,

11:41.468 --> 11:44.936
    and he died 4 years ago.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.745
        -i remember him.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.350
     is there anyone left?

11:59.352 --> 12:01.853
              -me.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.089
           i'm here.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.525
        you were lucky.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.027
            -lucky?

12:09.029 --> 12:10.595
       -to get pregnant.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.697
   jules can't have children,

12:12.699 --> 12:14.999
     and kevin was a fluke.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.678
     -don't worry about me.
         don't film me.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.180
      film the lighthouse
         and the ocean.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.516
       -ah, that's nice.
             -yeah.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.585
what?  stop.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.853
    -take off your clothes.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.521
     -take off my clothes?
             -yeah.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.356
     -it's a public beach.
      -let's go swimming.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.525
      -i'm not gonna go ...
 it's 40 degrees in the water.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.460
      -yeah, it's perfect.
          -it's not ...

12:42.462 --> 12:45.029
        jules, come on.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.766
you can't be serious.
    -i'm going.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.268
        -come on. stop.
      -come on. you stop.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.803
        -it's 20 degrees
       out there, jules.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.304
         -it's perfect.
       -you will freeze.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.807
- it's so cold.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.542
 -stop taking your clothes off.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.878
 you're not going in the water.
            come on!

12:59.880 --> 13:01.312
      -but i'm really good
          at swimming.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.781
    -once you hit the waves,
           you'll ...

13:02.783 --> 13:04.783
- okay.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.988
    -oh, my god, it's cold!

13:14.560 --> 13:17.061
      -i'm not coming in.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.130
       i'm not coming in.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.633
       i'm not coming in!

13:21.635 --> 13:23.501
      will you marry me?!

13:23.503 --> 13:25.837
       -you work in a lab
      at next corporation.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.138
         -what is that?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.940
             -it's
  a government-contracted lab

13:28.942 --> 13:31.142
      focused on the study
     of chromosomes, okay?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.178
 -what did i do there exactly?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.446
         -you were one
 of their leading geneticists.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.748
       before kevin died,

13:36.750 --> 13:38.683
       you'd been working
        100-hour weeks.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.354
      -it had been a while
 since you'd seen your family.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.259
      -are you all right?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.602
 why didn't she want to see me?

14:01.841 --> 14:05.343
   -because you were driving.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.981
   kevin was riding his bike

14:09.983 --> 14:13.518
      and you were driving
        and you hit him.

14:13.520 --> 14:17.522
  and that's how it happened.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.531
             yeah.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.373
   -is it okay if i lie down?

14:55.694 --> 14:57.695
 -and when do results come in?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.030
              mm.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.498
        i said thursday.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.600
         -not thursday.
we have some real problems here.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.802
           -tomorrow?

15:06.839 --> 15:10.074
it just doesn't seem reasonable.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.377
          i didn't say
      it was unreasonable.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.779
     i said it didn't <i> seem</i>
          reasonable.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.684
     we agreed on thursday,

15:19.686 --> 15:23.087
 and i'd like to stick to that
        if we can, okay?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.390
-i don't care what we agreed to.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.926
             -okay.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.028
        okay. tomorrow.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.196
     make it out to archer.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.532
           thank you.
             okay.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.301
              bye.

15:54.320 --> 15:59.290
     i'll have to step out
     for a while, william.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.060
           stay here.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.062
       don't go outside.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.898
       i just don't think
      you're ready is all.

16:10.836 --> 16:15.273
      if you need anything
    or if anything happens,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.909
 just pick up the telephone...

16:19.813 --> 16:24.015
   ...and dial these numbers
          and call me.

16:33.525 --> 16:38.129
  william, you put this cereal
      in a bowl with milk,

16:38.131 --> 16:41.399
 and that's how you eat cereal.

16:45.704 --> 16:47.905
             okay.

18:12.891 --> 18:17.595
     -cellular degeneration
        dates this proxy

18:17.597 --> 18:20.965
    at exactly the same age
       as the prototype.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.135
           we grafted
     the telomerase protein

18:24.137 --> 18:27.138
 and used it as an rna template
         like you said.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.174
 same results every time. look.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.615
 cell division rate is perfect.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.419
they're pretty much exact clones
     in every physical way.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.322
          they've got
    the same blood pressure,

18:44.324 --> 18:47.658
      same brain function,
      same response time,

18:47.660 --> 18:51.129
        but...we've run
    into some other issues.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.135
      massive brain tumors
         have developed

18:57.137 --> 18:58.803
        in 7/10 of them.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.873
    -70% have brain tumors?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.236
   and how long do they live?

19:34.206 --> 19:37.275
   -they're not gonna make it
            a month.

20:21.019 --> 20:25.590
   -i hate to do this to you
    on your first day back,

20:25.592 --> 20:27.425
   but we have some visitors
         from upstairs.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.427
- what do you mean "upstairs"?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.861
-they're down here to talk about

20:30.863 --> 20:32.597
        what has become
    a very sensitive issue.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.031
       -what do you mean?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.700
        -and i need you
    to cooperate with them.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.202
a set of samples from the second
      round of splicing...

20:39.872 --> 20:41.739
            ...along
   with some corelle solution

20:41.741 --> 20:44.342
      has gone missing ...
   that and some human eggs.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.877
         -missing? how?
             -uh...

20:46.879 --> 20:49.280
            -hello?

20:49.282 --> 20:52.383
       -i'm coming home.

20:52.385 --> 20:55.720
    i'm gonna make it right.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.856
      -i don't understand.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.058
          -i'm sorry.
  i never should've left you.

21:01.060 --> 21:05.429
     -you sound different.
         are you okay?

21:05.431 --> 21:09.100
    -i'm done running away.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.870
- hello?

21:33.492 --> 21:36.394
   -they're just making sure
       that it was no one
        from the staff.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.062
    answer their questions.

21:38.064 --> 21:40.498
   -but why would they think
 it's ... it doesn't make sense.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.067
          wait. stop.
          -gentlemen.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.647
           -william,
  it's good to have you back.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.549
           -morning.
         -this is tom.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.552
      -tom. tom langley ...
   spenning, brag, and penn.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.820
     -i'm william blakely.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.455
  -we just need a few answers
            on this.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.256
           -on what?
  -sorry, what's the question?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.066
      -you said you needed
     a few answers on this.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.735
        -they're talking
     to everyone, william.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.370
      they're just taking
       through the staff,

22:52.372 --> 22:54.071
      trying to make sure
         that no one ...

22:54.073 --> 22:55.473
      but dr. blakely runs
       our research lab.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.208
 -you're a company man, right,
            william?

22:57.210 --> 22:59.810
      -he's one of our ...
          -excuse me?

23:03.515 --> 23:06.016
          -corelle ...
  it's a cloning agent, right?

23:06.018 --> 23:07.318
        -that's correct.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.986
    -you took last week off.
         is that right?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.588
          -dr. archer,
   i don't understand what ...

23:10.590 --> 23:14.925
    -four samples of corelle
 are missing from specimen 29.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.105
  -that surprise you, william?
    -does that surprise me?

23:28.107 --> 23:29.774
  -hey, how's that stuff work,
            anyway?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.108
      -it, uh, stabilizes

23:31.110 --> 23:32.943
     an amino acid sequence
         in the q-45 ...

23:32.945 --> 23:34.412
  -that must be worth millions
       on the open market

23:34.414 --> 23:36.380
    if someone were selling.
     -what are you saying?

23:36.382 --> 23:38.382
  what are you trying to say?
   -what am i trying to say?

23:38.384 --> 23:40.684
 -if you're saying what i think
     you're trying to say,

23:40.686 --> 23:43.421
there's a very serious insinu...
it's a very serious accusation.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.256
  -william, wait. william, no.
-dr. archer, it's an accusation.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.791
      it's an accusation.
     -william, no, how long

23:46.793 --> 23:48.292
   have we known each other?
      -it's an accusation.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.760
       he's accusing me.
     -please, seven years.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.429
       william is one of
      our most trusted ...

23:51.431 --> 23:53.063
       -i signed a 206-c.
          you under...

23:53.065 --> 23:54.965
you know that next corporation's
   secrets are safe with me.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.901
         -william, no.
    -i'm sure that they are.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.536
  what about the other people
      that you work with?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.070
-i've spent the last seven years
           of my life

24:00.072 --> 24:01.539
   working around the clock,

24:01.541 --> 24:03.207
     and you're telling me
    that because of a lapse

24:03.209 --> 24:04.742
    in a multimillion-dollar
        security system,

24:04.744 --> 24:07.044
    that somebody has walked
       out the front door

24:07.046 --> 24:09.547
  with proprietary information
   regarding the first round
     of telomerase slicing.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.449
      do you have any idea
  the months of work it takes

24:11.451 --> 24:13.384
to create 12 ounces of corelle?

24:13.386 --> 24:15.119
        do you even know
     what it's capable of?

24:15.121 --> 24:17.221
  -i don't know. i don't care.
-dr. archer, i don't understand.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.789
       -william, william.
 all right, william, thank you.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.558
          -dr. archer.
   -thank you for coming in.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.092
-we're going to go ahead and ...
      -we'll see you soon.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.828
   -i'll ... i'll be in touch.
       -who is that man?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.429
        who is that man?
       what is his name?

24:25.431 --> 24:27.064
 -he, uh ... he is just from ...
       -what is his name?

24:28.835 --> 24:31.001
             -okay.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.142
 -william, what are you doing?

25:12.144 --> 25:14.445
         -who are you?

25:14.447 --> 25:18.983
       where's my family?

25:18.985 --> 25:21.685
      where is my family?

25:21.687 --> 25:24.154
      where is my family?!

25:24.156 --> 25:26.390
          -calm down.
           -sit down.

25:26.392 --> 25:27.725
       sit in the chair.
            -o-okay.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.560
           -sit down!

25:29.562 --> 25:31.662
             -okay.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.497
      -hands out in front.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.665
      -william, calm down.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.233
  watch the g... watch the gun.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.968
      be careful, william.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.169
          be careful.
          be careful.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.372
  -quiet. quiet. quiet. quiet.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.407
    just tell me the truth.
    just tell me the truth.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.175
          that's all.
   -i work in a genetics lab.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.877
   a research project focused
           on the...

25:46.879 --> 25:48.846
   -what does this have to do
            with me?

25:48.848 --> 25:51.549
    -...a controlling agent.
     -where is my family?!

25:51.551 --> 25:53.884
      where is my family?!
   -you don't have a family.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.186
    you don't have a family.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.756
            my lab,

25:58.758 --> 26:03.260
      the lab where i work

26:03.262 --> 26:07.865
 not extending people's lives,
 but making them older, faster,

26:07.867 --> 26:10.901
 then recording and implanting
      learned behavior ...

26:10.903 --> 26:13.604
      facial recognition,
    image memory, language,

26:13.606 --> 26:17.107
   like loading up a computer
           with data.

26:17.109 --> 26:20.177
             -why?

26:20.179 --> 26:24.281
        -because we want
       to make clones ...

26:24.283 --> 26:26.183
         replacements.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.751
            proxies.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.427
   you are a proxy, william.

26:36.429 --> 26:40.397
       you are <i> my</i> proxy.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.300
            -get up.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.902
            get up.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.104
      go. go. go. go. go.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.974
       go up the stairs.
       go up the stairs.
       go up the stairs!

26:49.976 --> 26:51.809
        don't sit down!
       go up the stairs!

26:51.811 --> 26:53.644
    -no, this is ridiculous,
            william.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.245
       -go up the stairs!
  get up and go up the stairs!

26:55.247 --> 26:58.282
              -no.
            -get up.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.883
    -stop, stop, stop! stop!

26:59.885 --> 27:03.087
  william, think through this.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.989
what do you think has happened?

27:04.991 --> 27:07.558
       don't you realize
     that if they find out

27:07.560 --> 27:09.259
  what we've done, it's over?

27:09.261 --> 27:10.828
          william, no.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.496
      what are you doing?

27:12.498 --> 27:14.164
      what are you doing?

27:14.166 --> 27:15.466
             stop.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.168
  -lie back. lie back. quiet.
           lie back.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.409
       -okay, okay, okay.

27:30.615 --> 27:34.018
-put your feet under the straps.
       under the straps.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.153
 let's go. under. under. under.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.460
      -what are you doing?
      what are you doing?

27:43.462 --> 27:46.630
      where are you going?
    -i am going to find her.

27:46.632 --> 27:48.666
          to find her.

27:52.638 --> 27:57.608
   -and to find out who i am.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.547
            -no. no!

35:45.576 --> 35:47.310
           -william?

35:53.752 --> 35:57.988
    i saw you from the bus.

35:57.990 --> 36:01.758
     are you following me?

36:01.760 --> 36:04.261
           -yes. no.

36:04.263 --> 36:07.330
      i wanted to see you.

36:09.934 --> 36:12.702
       -well, you see me.

36:16.774 --> 36:19.376
   you ... you want to ask me
  to get coffee or something?

36:19.378 --> 36:22.012
             -yes.
           yes, i do.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.215
        or we could get
     ice-cream sandwiches.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.652
             okay.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.320
       -you're beautiful.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.690
         i didn't know.
    i saw the photos, but...

36:33.692 --> 36:36.726
you really are.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.030
           -you okay?

36:40.032 --> 36:42.866
             -yeah.

      -i have to go, okay?

36:48.507 --> 36:50.473

37:15.901 --> 37:18.101
            -hello?

37:18.103 --> 37:20.203
       no, i'll be there.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.671
        i'm fine, yeah.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.607
         i understand.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.675
 no, i said ... what i said was
   it would take a few days.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.277
 that's the nature of time off,
           isn't it?

37:27.279 --> 37:29.145
    suspicious? suspicious?

37:36.687 --> 37:39.789
no, i'm here, yeah.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.191

          -all right.

37:41.193 --> 37:43.360
             -well,
   there's actually something

37:43.362 --> 37:45.729
        i wanted to talk
       to you about, too.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.297
   no, i think we should meet
           in person.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.565
     thank you, dr. archer.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.267
    -take care of yourself.
             -okay.

37:55.239 --> 37:57.140
          -ah, baxter,

37:57.142 --> 38:00.210
    can you lock up tonight?
             -sure.

38:00.212 --> 38:02.712
     -the men from upstairs
are gonna be here pretty early.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.581
             -okay.
  -did you notice anything odd

38:04.583 --> 38:06.416
     about william tonight?

38:06.418 --> 38:07.817
             -why?

38:07.819 --> 38:10.553
    -uh, oh, he just, um...

38:10.555 --> 38:13.223
um, i'm going to meet with him.

38:13.225 --> 38:14.591
          -this late?

38:14.593 --> 38:16.660
   -yeah, it sounded urgent.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.995
 is this one from specimen 29?

38:18.997 --> 38:21.965
   -yeah, he's the last one.

38:25.102 --> 38:28.238
          dr. archer,
    can i ask you something?

38:28.240 --> 38:33.810
 why is it you still work here
         at next corp?

38:33.812 --> 38:37.781
 -you know, i look at this dog,
          and i think,

38:37.783 --> 38:41.751
       "life is the whim
    of several billion cells

38:41.753 --> 38:44.254
    to be you for a while."

38:44.256 --> 38:46.189
       -what's that from?

38:46.191 --> 38:48.692
        -cant' remember.

38:48.694 --> 38:53.163
  baxter, you don't just quit
        a job like this.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.265
             -why?

38:55.267 --> 38:58.268
        -you just don't.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.421
             -okay.

40:58.423 --> 41:01.291
      don't start the car.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.062
  i just want to take a minute

41:06.064 --> 41:09.632
to explain

41:09.634 --> 41:11.668
     what's been going on.

41:11.670 --> 41:14.270
-you mean ... you mean with you?

41:14.272 --> 41:19.476
     -no, with the samples.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.978
          -all right.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.014
william, what's been going on

41:25.016 --> 41:27.517
       with the samples?

41:27.519 --> 41:30.920
 -i know you've been concerned

41:30.922 --> 41:34.123
  with the men from upstairs.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.592
           -william.

41:36.995 --> 41:40.330
   these guys are not joking
       around, all right?

41:40.332 --> 41:44.100
   internal special security.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.802
    the entire department ...

41:45.804 --> 41:48.538
     they can shut it down
just like that if they want to.

41:48.540 --> 41:52.275
     they will not hesitate
        to put us down.

41:54.044 --> 41:56.279
and i've given you
       every opportunity.

41:56.281 --> 41:57.814
      i have defended you.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.849
   i've given people my word.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.552
        i've backed you
    at every turn, william,

42:02.554 --> 42:06.456
       but your behavior
  is increasingly suspicious.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.861
           william...

42:11.863 --> 42:17.867
        the best move is
     for you to come clean.

42:24.808 --> 42:28.144
     -you were the only one
      who was kind to me.

42:28.146 --> 42:29.913
          -all right.

42:32.417 --> 42:36.519
     -i thought to myself,
       "what a kind man."

42:36.521 --> 42:39.055
       -right, william ...
     -stop interrupting me.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.257
          i talk now.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.996
    and i didn't understand

42:46.998 --> 42:49.265
   why you were being so nice
             to me.

42:52.871 --> 42:57.373
-and then i realized that it was

42:57.375 --> 43:02.278
    because next corporation
    needed william blakely.

43:02.280 --> 43:07.951
        they were afraid
      of william blakely.

43:15.059 --> 43:16.459
- good.

43:16.461 --> 43:18.428
           good job.

43:18.430 --> 43:19.862
         good, william.

43:19.864 --> 43:21.564
  we are gonna deal with this.

43:21.566 --> 43:24.467
       i am your friend.

43:24.469 --> 43:27.203
      i will help you out.

43:27.205 --> 43:30.406
   -don't touch it. sit back.

43:30.408 --> 43:32.942
       -what do you think
        you're gonna do?

43:32.944 --> 43:34.477
       what do you think
        you're gonna do?

43:34.479 --> 43:36.045
      -i'm going to leave.
          -what are ...

43:36.047 --> 43:38.448
no one leaves next corporation.
             -i do.

44:23.761 --> 44:26.663
           -william?

44:26.665 --> 44:29.065
            william?

46:13.470 --> 46:18.908
     -i told you everything
      you needed to know.

46:18.910 --> 46:23.446
   except it's not your life,

46:23.448 --> 46:25.081
         it's my life.

46:25.083 --> 46:27.617
    you have to understand.

46:27.619 --> 46:32.388
      i...i lost a child.

46:32.390 --> 46:37.426
       i was responsible.

46:37.428 --> 46:41.864
 my life ended that day, so...

46:44.434 --> 46:46.736
         -how old am i?

46:46.738 --> 46:50.339
  -15 months since inception.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.642
    you've been alive for 6.

46:52.644 --> 46:55.344
   i didn't mean to hurt you.

46:55.346 --> 46:59.048
i just wanted to fix something.

47:02.953 --> 47:06.489
   -but what if i don't want
     to be william blakely?

47:06.491 --> 47:09.258
         -you have to.

47:18.168 --> 47:20.937
     -you have to do this.
     i need you to do this.

47:20.939 --> 47:24.907
  jules needs you to do this.

47:32.015 --> 47:35.785
             -okay.

47:35.787 --> 47:37.954
             okay.

47:41.525 --> 47:43.392
      but you have to go.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.228
       you have to leave.

47:45.230 --> 47:46.996
      you can't stay here.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.565
        you have to go.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.735
     -i'll leave tomorrow.

47:57.307 --> 47:59.475
             -okay.

48:47.524 --> 48:49.425
             jules.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.861
             jules.

48:51.863 --> 48:54.430
       jules, i'm sorry.
       i didn't know h...

48:54.432 --> 48:56.532
 -william, not right now, okay?
     i mean, what is this?
       what do you want?

48:56.534 --> 48:57.967
   -i just didn't have any ...
     i'd have no one else.

48:57.969 --> 48:59.602
    -you can't just show up
         to my bus stop

48:59.604 --> 49:01.604
       and just expect me
to, like, relate to you, right?

49:01.606 --> 49:04.040
     the world doesn't stop
      just because decide

49:04.042 --> 49:06.275
      that you don't want
      to be a part of it.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.610
      it's just not fair.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.378
     -jules, i'm not trying
         to upset you.

49:09.380 --> 49:11.580
 i just don't have anyone else
   to reach out to right now.

49:11.582 --> 49:13.249
  -well, you <i> are</i> upsetting me,
            william.

49:13.251 --> 49:16.118
    -please, all i'm asking
   is a minute of your time.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.620
 -what did you just say to me?

49:17.622 --> 49:19.388
      -l-l-listen, jules.
         please, wait.

49:19.390 --> 49:21.958
      -no. no, no, no, no.
you don't get to say that to me.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.226
      all i had was time.
       you weren't there.

49:24.228 --> 49:26.896
           -i'm so...
 -no, okay, i get it. i get it.

49:26.898 --> 49:28.331
      is this about kevin?

49:28.333 --> 49:29.799
   -i don't know. i'm sorry.

49:29.801 --> 49:31.434
     -what? you ... you want
      to talk about kevin?

49:31.436 --> 49:33.970
    is this what it's about?

49:36.306 --> 49:38.474
     do you know what i do?
   do you know what this is?

49:38.476 --> 49:39.909
      i carry this around.

49:39.911 --> 49:42.678
        this is his hair
    from his first haircut.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.480
i think that i deserve him back
         in some ways.

49:44.482 --> 49:47.283
     -you do deserve that.
 i believe you do deserve that.

49:47.285 --> 49:49.185
   -no. there is no deserve.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.787
    there are no moral order
        to any of this.

49:51.789 --> 49:54.824
     we don't get paid back
   for the pain that we felt.

49:54.826 --> 49:56.625
   there's none of that shit.

49:56.627 --> 49:58.794
i was willing to go on with you.

49:58.796 --> 50:01.097
    you caved. you ran away.

50:01.099 --> 50:02.798

    i can't answer for that,
       but i am here now.

        -i just see him
      when i look at you.

50:12.477 --> 50:15.111
       -but why not make
       that a good thing?

50:25.389 --> 50:28.024
           -i can't.

51:04.562 --> 51:05.828
            -hello?

51:05.830 --> 51:08.164
   -hello, william. william?

        looking for you.

51:13.171 --> 51:15.171
     if you're going to be
        william blakely,

52:28.279 --> 52:30.646
 -william, take a walk with me?

52:30.648 --> 52:32.848
      have you seen archer
         this morning?

52:32.850 --> 52:35.451
        he was a no-show
   for the q1 budget report.

52:35.453 --> 52:37.453
     -no, i didn't see him.

52:37.455 --> 52:40.156
    -well, when you see him,
     could you tell him to
        stop by, please?

52:40.158 --> 52:41.457

           the dogs?

53:47.257 --> 53:51.227
     -this is the last one
       from specimen 29.

53:51.229 --> 53:55.097
    the tumor spread faster
      than we anticipated.

53:55.099 --> 53:57.366
          -the tumors?

53:57.368 --> 54:00.603
       -the brain tumors.

54:05.276 --> 54:07.543
    -i don't know what it is
          that you do,

54:07.545 --> 54:09.578
    what you've got going on
            in here,

54:09.580 --> 54:13.249
but, um, i'm done playing games.

54:13.251 --> 54:15.618
         -i-i'm sorry.

54:15.620 --> 54:18.220
    i don't ... i don't know
   what you're talking about.

54:18.222 --> 54:20.556
       -a man has a right
        to his privacy.

54:20.558 --> 54:22.057
    i get it. i respect it.

54:22.059 --> 54:24.460
     but as your neighbor,
         i have a duty

54:24.462 --> 54:28.430
         to report any
   suspicious activity, okay?

54:28.432 --> 54:32.034
   -look, i think we got off
       on the wrong foot.

54:32.036 --> 54:33.402
          i'm william.

54:33.404 --> 54:36.772
  -i know. we've met. lester.

54:38.041 --> 54:41.610
  -i know that what i do here
      might seem strange,

54:41.612 --> 54:45.381
  but i think we're just going
 a little burb crazy out here.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.717
       -i'm a geneticist.

54:48.719 --> 54:50.452
  i work for next corporation.

54:50.454 --> 54:52.821
           you know,
   the big building downtown

54:52.823 --> 54:54.423
        and the slogan,

54:54.425 --> 54:58.160
  "building a better tomorrow
      one cell at a time."

54:58.162 --> 55:00.262
           i could...

55:00.264 --> 55:02.331
  i could show you what we do.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.166
     it's very interesting.

55:04.168 --> 55:06.502
     i'll make some coffee.

55:06.504 --> 55:08.637
      get out of the cold.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.472
            come on.

55:12.910 --> 55:16.011
 so, you do science and stuff?

55:16.013 --> 55:18.280
      -yeah, i do science.

55:18.282 --> 55:21.083
          come on in.

55:21.085 --> 55:24.019
  -two others died last night
       and one yesterday.

55:24.021 --> 55:27.256
        -they're dying?

55:27.258 --> 55:29.625
 -that has a tendency to happen
  when you have a brain tumor,
            doctor.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.095
          apparently,
    when you clone a clone,

55:33.097 --> 55:35.264
            you get
   all these weird anomalies

55:35.266 --> 55:37.533
 like brain tumors, blindness.

55:41.671 --> 55:44.206
          -blindness?

55:44.208 --> 55:46.675
 -yeah, they've all gone blind
      in the late stages.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.143
 -did you say "clone a clone"?

55:48.145 --> 55:49.912
       what do you mean?

55:54.984 --> 55:57.086
          i should go.

56:01.291 --> 56:04.159
   -are you doing all right,
          dr. blakely?

56:04.161 --> 56:06.628
             -whoa.
      -yeah, there we are.

56:07.497 --> 56:09.998
  -that's pretty well-hidden.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.368
         -well, listen,
     would you like to see?

56:12.370 --> 56:14.036
         head on down,

56:14.038 --> 56:16.171
  and i'll get a piece of gear
      that makes it work.

56:16.173 --> 56:19.041
  there's a light switch right
    down there at the bottom
        of the landing.

56:19.043 --> 56:20.743
 i'll be right back. go ahead.

56:20.745 --> 56:23.812
  you got to see. it's great.
             -sure.

56:45.869 --> 56:47.836
         hey, william?

57:24.274 --> 57:26.909
       p-please, william.

57:26.911 --> 57:29.711
 i ... i think i broke my neck.

57:31.315 --> 57:34.416
 -you're a curious man, lester.

57:35.820 --> 57:38.754
-i had a breakthrough yesterday.

57:38.756 --> 57:40.722
              i...

57:40.724 --> 57:42.491
 i used to be afraid of people.

57:42.493 --> 57:43.992
    i used to run from them.

57:43.994 --> 57:46.261
         but i realized

57:46.263 --> 57:48.997
       that might not be
      the right approach.

57:53.571 --> 57:58.707
 -i was born on the other side
   of that door in a bathtub.

58:01.778 --> 58:05.247
       it took him months
       of trial and error

58:05.249 --> 58:07.282
   and he killed the defects

58:07.284 --> 58:10.953
        and buried them
in the backyard under the snow.

58:10.955 --> 58:14.256
      and then he made me.

58:22.532 --> 58:26.034
 i was designed to learn fast.

58:26.036 --> 58:30.005
   exponential brain growth.

58:30.007 --> 58:33.442
        i learned things
      in leaps and bounds.

58:58.535 --> 59:02.037
 tried to make a better version
         of himself...

59:02.039 --> 59:03.805
    -let me tell you a joke.

59:03.807 --> 59:05.674
    -...without the guilt...

59:05.676 --> 59:08.210
         -knock, knock.

59:08.212 --> 59:10.913
    -...but it backfired...
         -knock, knock?

59:10.915 --> 59:13.248
          -...because
     he had made a mirror,

59:13.250 --> 59:16.051
         and it became
      a constant reminder

59:16.053 --> 59:20.656
         of who he was
     and what he had done.

59:20.658 --> 59:23.825
 -don't cry. it's just a joke.

59:27.196 --> 59:30.065
      -i don't understand.

59:33.169 --> 59:35.137
 -never mind. it's just a joke.

59:38.408 --> 59:40.909
         use this spoon
      to eat your cereal.

59:40.911 --> 59:44.112
   -he had convinced himself
      that i was ready ...

59:44.114 --> 59:48.450
that i was ready to go it alone,
        to do it myself.

59:48.452 --> 59:51.553
 but i knew the real reason was
    that he was sick of me.

59:51.555 --> 59:53.355
he was sick of the sight of me,

59:53.357 --> 59:56.024
the sight of himself, every day,
     everywhere he looked.

59:56.026 --> 01:00:00.295
...and so, he left me.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.835
        he abandoned me.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:20.082
 he left me with a black book,

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.985
     a survivor's guide ...

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:26.922
     maps and credit cards
         and histories,

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:32.327
  information about his wife,
          his wife ...

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:37.332
 how to find her and help her.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.802
      it took me two weeks
     to run out of food...

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:46.808
      and then i went out
        into the world.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.511
        i was starving.

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:52.581
       and i was arrested
         24 hours later

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.082
      in a grocery store.

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:55.484
        i was terrified.

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:58.820
   he'd told me the world was
         a good place,

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.356
      but that was a lie.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:05.994
  the world is a cruel place,
      and i didn't belong.

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.038
       they processed me.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.206
      they categorized me.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.308
      they classified me.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:24.780
 they told me i was delusional,
         schizophrenic,

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:29.051
 a danger to myself and others.

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:51.339
      when they did this,

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:54.376
i would go to a place far away,

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.912
   like a recurring dream...

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:09.224
   ...that i would escape to.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:12.160
      and i've been trying
      to find that place,

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:15.831
 to go back there, ever since.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:43.291
and i'm closer now than before.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:47.129
          i'm as close
    as i've ever been, okay?

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:51.366
   next corporation found me
        in three months.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:54.636
 they had searched everywhere.

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:57.773
      they needed me back
     to continue the work,

01:02:57.775 --> 01:03:00.408
     and i came back here.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.311
and i was alone, totally alone.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:10.552
     i had nothing, no one.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.492
         and i decided
      to follow his lead.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:27.569
      and i made a proxy.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:32.507
  and that makes me invisible,
         unaccountable.

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:37.245
     i'm going to disappear
      like he disappeared,

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:40.282
 and no one will come after me.

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:44.152
        before i leave,
     i'm going to make sure

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.922
          that he will
     never forget me again.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.824
    he's going to understand

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:54.729
       what it feels like
    to hurt the way i hurt.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:12.113
  so this is my breakthrough.

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:19.721
  taking a human life is easy
           for me...

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.726
   ...because i'm different.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.732
      -i'm not even human.

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:35.937
     i'm better than that.

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:49.251
           -william,
  i didn't do anything to you!

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:50.986
please, no!

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.878
     -you're baxter, right?

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.747
       -i'm sorry, what?

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.220
     -you're a company man,
         right, baxter?

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:27.022
        -what ... what ...
     what do you guys want?

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:33.228
      -i can count on you
     to help me out, right?

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:39.034
     -you talked to archer
   last night before he left.

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.870
     what did he tell you?

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:24.446
         hi, jules. hi.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.114
  hi, jules, would you like ...

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:30.185
do you have time this afternoon
         to come here?

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.754
    it's amazing to see you.
       you look amazing.

01:06:32.756 --> 01:06:34.422
           hi, jules.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:38.593
 do you have time to come over
     here and talk about...

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.963
          come on in.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:43.198
         coffee? water?

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.833
 you want to see some footage?

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:46.334
   we owe that to each other.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.036
  we owe that to kevin, jules.

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:49.537
    i have shots of every ...

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:51.539
           and kevin,
     i have stuff of kevin.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:54.042
      no, i know. i know.
           don't cry.

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:56.644
    i don't like it, either.
           don't cry.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:59.214
   you remember that one time
 we were on the beach together?

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:01.616
          if you could
     just give me a chance.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.785
     it's true. it's true.
       i agree with you.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:09.290
  no, i'm not laughing at you,
  and i'd like to talk to you.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:11.192
    i don't like it, either.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.827
           i feel ...

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:18.366
     i feel like we owe it
  to each other to be better.

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:23.905
  -pick up. pick up. pick up.
       pick up. pick up.

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:26.641
- hello?

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:28.309
           -william?

01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:31.846
              -hi.

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:33.548
              -hi.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.518
          listen, uh,

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.821
   we can't do this anymore.

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:42.624
     we need to finish it.

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:50.298
       i want a divorce.

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:54.869
             hello?

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.838
       -no, i ... i agree.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.041
      i'm glad you called.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:01.443
     do you have time today

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:03.711
       to come over here
        and talk to me?

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:07.215
  and we can just sort of sit
 and talk about the next steps?

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:09.951
  -okay, what's your address?

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:14.556
   -"to whom it may concern,
     jules braxton-blakely

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:19.127
    "will be my wife forever
    and always to eternity.

hello.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:03.138
       -i just found out
        what's going on.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.241
     i can't understand why
       you would do this.

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:07.942
             -yeah.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:11.312
          tough break.
         -listen to me.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.915
   -it's funny how sometimes
      things just work out

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.350
   like they're supposed to.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:17.685
         your friend is
   on her way over here now,

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:20.255
    and we're going to have
          a nice chat.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.523
            goodbye.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.819
          come on in.

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:54.622
           thank you.

         step in here.

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:37.932
          -reminds me
 of your old grad-school place.

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:40.368
             -yeah.
     -the one on braeburn?

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.770
              -mm.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:45.840
 -how long have you been here?

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:49.677
   -i moved here a while ago.
   it feels like forever ago.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.084
   in the middle of nowhere.

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:59.621
             -yeah,
  it's the middle of nowhere.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.891
-what year was your father born?

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:06.594
          -my father?
     -answer the question.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.563
             -1942.
-what's your wife's maiden name?

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:09.931
           -braxton.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.733
      -you had a brother,
       an identical twin.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.401
            he died
   when you were 4-years-old.

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.902
       what was his name?

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:18.873
   dr. archer was found dead
     in his car last night

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:21.042
   with the corelle solution.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:22.410
          -dr. archer?

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:24.512
       i have to go now.

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.483
     -i know what you are.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:32.320
what the hell is wrong with you?

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.128
        you, don't move.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.196
  i need to see the two of you
       outside right now.

01:13:32.207 --> 01:13:34.609
- baxter!

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.864
  -so, then what <i> do</i> you want?

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:02.904
         just tell me.

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.639
        i'm your friend.

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:09.610
      you can talk to me.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.512
  none of this is your fault.

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:19.887
     -how would any of this
          be my fault?

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:22.123
  -i shouldn't have come here.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:25.793
-wait. jules, wait. wait. wait.
      -no, i feel stupid.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.562
    this is not a good idea.

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:30.064
       -before you came,
   i was watching footage ...

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:33.835
       old footage of you
     and me and kevin, too.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:38.172
         it helped me.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.975
    it gave me perspective.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.644
  i think you should watch it
          with me now.

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.848
     i think it's important
          to do that.

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.317
            come on.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:16.444
     -<i> about seven months.</i>

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:29.991
  the fuck have you been doing
        for four years?

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:33.394
    -i wanted to disappear.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:42.403
         but i realized
that i was stuck with myself...

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:51.245
with this body, these memories,
     and it felt like jail.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:53.648
            -no. no.

01:15:56.084 --> 01:15:57.885
        just come here.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.528
            -<i> daddy!</i>

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:14.335
           just admit
     this is what you want.

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:34.855
   let me get you some water
         or something.

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.395
             okay.

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.297
     -<i> go on. not too fast.</i>

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:03.117
         -<i> you rolling?</i>
            -<i> yeah.</i>

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:05.820
            <i> mm-hmm.</i>

01:17:05.822 --> 01:17:08.322
      -<i> you getting this?</i>
       -<i> i got it, babe.</i>

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:11.325
     <i> show me what you got.</i>

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:39.687
           -william,
    what are you doing here?

01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:41.489
        -you lied to me.

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.324
   -you want her to hear us?

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.860
     huh? what'd she think?

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:50.197
    you think she loves you?

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.967
        i promise you...

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:55.770
             -stop.
 -...the minute she finds out.

01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:57.505
             -stop.
          -no. no. no.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.607
         listen to me.
 listen, listen, listen. stop.

01:17:59.609 --> 01:18:00.875
            -quiet.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:03.010
      -everything you are
       is because of me.

01:18:03.012 --> 01:18:05.613
       everything you do,
    everything you think ...

01:18:05.615 --> 01:18:08.182
  everything is because of me.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:11.786
      me, me, me, me, me.

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.725
          -i'm sorry.

01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:52.993
           i'm sorry.

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:12.747
   -<i> can you hear me, kevin?</i>

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.682
  <i> let's go. we'll take a ride.</i>

01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:16.450
    <i> here we go. here we go.</i>

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.989
            -jules.

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:58.259
   -i thought that you wanted
    the same thing. i was ...

01:19:58.261 --> 01:20:00.928
        -jules, come on.
    -that was really silly.

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.730
              god.

01:20:02.732 --> 01:20:04.832
     -i'm in love with you.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:12.173
 -that's the only thing i know.

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:16.343
  that's the only thing i know
 is that i am in love with you.

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:24.552
            come on.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.927
          okay. okay.

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.604
          i love you.

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:45.339
          i love you.

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:38.018
      -what are you doing?

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:43.557
   what the hell is going on?

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:46.694
         -who are you?

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:51.732
         -you made him?

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.170
do you realize what you've done?

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.608
do you realize the consequences
     of what you've done?!

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:04.211
    -i am the consequences!

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.996
      i'm not your proxy.

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:27.501
         i'm his proxy.
          he made me.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.236
       do you understand?

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:38.946
     he was gonna hurt her,
       and i stopped him.

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:42.816
       why are you here?

01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:46.086
i mean, w-why did you come back?
            why now?

01:23:55.964 --> 01:24:01.935
    -because this is the day
that kevin died four years ago.

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.375
 i thought she'd be better off
          without me.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.382
  i thought i'd be better off
          without me.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.551
   and i tried to reach out.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:22.356
    i tried to make contact,
        but i couldn't.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.530
i killed our child.

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:41.408
      i killed our child.

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:03.230
     and so, i moved away.

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:08.735
   i moved into this house...

01:25:08.737 --> 01:25:11.238
             alone.

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:18.245
          and one day,
    i looked in the mirror,

01:25:18.247 --> 01:25:21.849
  and there was nothing there.

01:25:24.919 --> 01:25:26.587
          i was gone.

01:25:26.589 --> 01:25:29.189
      i was beyond repair.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.862
 and that's when the idea hit.

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:40.234
   i took a different track.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:42.002
    i went with what i knew.

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:46.773
           i thought
    i could replace myself,

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:50.310
make a better version of myself.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:53.647
  i-i could make improvements.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.516
     he could hear better.

01:25:55.518 --> 01:25:57.484
      he could see better.

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:05.626
 he would be without the guilt.

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:10.097
     and he could help her.

01:26:10.099 --> 01:26:12.266
     but i did it for her.

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:19.006
     i did it all for her.

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:37.758
            -get up.

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:06.019
  listen to me very carefully
     or you're never gonna
         see her again.

01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:07.888
       you understand me?

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:11.391
    you need to leave here.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:15.395
   take her with you, leave,
  and never come back ... ever.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.664
        you understand?

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:20.334
        -she's here now?

01:27:22.837 --> 01:27:25.105
        -i'm gonna burn
       this place down...

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:35.282
    ...so no one ever knows
       what you did here.

01:27:35.284 --> 01:27:39.486
      -but what about you?

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.425
          -i'm dying.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:48.295
        i'm dying, so...

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:52.266
  so <i> you</i> get a second chance.

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:56.069
so the least you can do

01:27:56.071 --> 01:27:59.106
        is promise me...

01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:04.077
 she will never be alone again.

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:06.413
      you promise me this.

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:10.984
      -she won't be alone.

01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:13.120
    -now, we don't have long
     before they get here.

01:28:13.122 --> 01:28:14.588
             -who?

01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:17.224
    -the men from the lab ...
     the men from upstairs.

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:21.228
           you're not
    william blakely anymore.

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:25.432
     he is. you understand?

01:28:25.434 --> 01:28:27.467
       give me your coat.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:26.026
      -i want to go back.

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:32.866
i want to go back to kill eagle.

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.886
       we can start over.

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:40.300
     -...like, a rapid form
        just to get out.

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:43.870
like, they were going that way.

01:30:43.872 --> 01:30:46.873
       look. what's this?

01:30:55.284 --> 01:30:57.150
        -i think got it.

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:59.820
     -oh, wow. that's good.

01:31:02.558 --> 01:31:05.559
    -let's go show your dad.

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:11.998
    wow. that's a nice one.

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:16.770
       -it's been buried.

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:19.372
       -go show your dad.

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:31.485
   -oh, wow, what do you got?

01:31:31.487 --> 01:31:33.854
 -i first found this part of it

01:31:33.856 --> 01:31:36.590
     and i kept on digging
  and i found the whole thing.

01:31:36.592 --> 01:31:37.824
            -mm-hmm.

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:42.195
        that is amazing.

01:31:42.197 --> 01:31:43.530
             yeah.

01:31:43.532 --> 01:31:46.132
         a sea creature
     used to live in there,

01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:48.768
  and the shell was its armor.

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.637
 yeah, this thing's really old.

01:31:50.639 --> 01:31:52.105
       it's prehistoric.

01:31:52.107 --> 01:31:54.774
     400 million years ago,
      these things were ...

01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:56.443
   these things were around.

01:31:56.445 --> 01:31:58.144
           and, uh ...

01:31:58.146 --> 01:32:00.213
       -where is it now?

01:32:00.215 --> 01:32:02.115
        -well, it died.

01:32:02.117 --> 01:32:07.687
    it died, and that's how
       we have the shell.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:09.723
   but the thing with this is

01:32:09.725 --> 01:32:12.726
     if you throw this back
         in the water,

01:32:12.728 --> 01:32:16.630
        there's a chance
that somebody else will use it.

01:32:16.632 --> 01:32:18.632
          -use it how?

01:32:18.634 --> 01:32:22.369
      -well, they use it.
        like, they'll...

01:32:22.371 --> 01:32:26.973
        crawl inside it
    and make it a new home.
