00:02.217 --> 00:04.218
You lied, Russ. You're a felon.

00:04.253 --> 00:05.219
We have to let you go.

00:05.254 --> 00:08.189
He said he'd been "made
aware" of my problem.

00:08.223 --> 00:09.523
That you were a convict.

00:09.558 --> 00:11.459
Somebody leaked information about me.

00:11.493 --> 00:13.693
Barb's out there on TV
saying the things she says.

00:13.729 --> 00:15.630
She's attracting the
wrong kind of attention.

00:15.664 --> 00:17.064
Why are you hounding my son, huh?

00:17.099 --> 00:17.965
We're not targeting Tony.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.767
You yank my boy off the street again,

00:19.801 --> 00:20.668
and that's not "targeting"?

00:20.702 --> 00:22.570
We have a recording of Tony assaulting

00:22.604 --> 00:23.804
another young man with a pipe.

00:23.839 --> 00:24.939
They're letting me go home?

00:24.973 --> 00:27.141
After you give the testimony
in court... that's the deal.

00:27.175 --> 00:29.610
So, what's the situation down in Sinaloa?

00:29.645 --> 00:31.746
- Man: Hello?
- <i>Sibila es allí?</i>

00:31.780 --> 00:32.780
Hector?

00:33.882 --> 00:36.217
He'd get me wasted,
and I would get passed around.

00:36.251 --> 00:38.219
Man: He and his friends sexually abused you?

00:38.253 --> 00:39.954
That's how it happened, right, Brian?

00:39.988 --> 00:42.657
You know she's lying. She's a drug addict!

00:42.691 --> 00:46.827
A good white kid gets
murdered in his home, well...

00:46.862 --> 00:49.330
That's okay because maybe he
smoked a joint on the weekends.

00:49.364 --> 00:52.099
The victim... people are
calling him a 9/11 hero,

00:52.134 --> 00:54.769
not the anti-government drug dealer he was.

00:54.803 --> 00:56.938
All I'm asking is to open an investigation

00:56.972 --> 00:59.407
into how this entire case has been handled.

00:59.441 --> 01:01.509
Please help me. I need you.

01:01.543 --> 01:04.845
For my brother, I ask for people
to honor our right to assemble

01:04.879 --> 01:06.647
and call attention to his situation.

01:06.682 --> 01:09.417
If they let us do that
peacefully, then it's all good.

01:09.451 --> 01:11.752
If we're greeted any other way...

01:11.787 --> 01:13.821
Then what happens isn't on us.

01:13.855 --> 01:14.922
It's on them.

01:16.725 --> 01:19.961
Narasaki: Test, test, test.

01:19.995 --> 01:20.962
We rolling?

01:20.996 --> 01:23.297
[Beep]

01:23.332 --> 01:26.200
It's been 3 1/2 months
since you were first arrested.

01:26.234 --> 01:29.670
Why are so many people suddenly
taking an interest in your case?

01:29.705 --> 01:30.871
Why now?

01:30.906 --> 01:32.840
My sister.

01:32.874 --> 01:35.176
Without her, I'd be just another black man

01:35.210 --> 01:37.511
thrown in prison and forgotten.

01:37.546 --> 01:39.380
She got <i>you to come here, right?</i>

01:39.414 --> 01:41.115
Kind of blows my mind

01:41.149 --> 01:43.818
what she and the people she's
working with are doing for me.

01:43.852 --> 01:45.987
Your sister plans to hold a march

01:46.021 --> 01:47.688
in downtown Modesto tomorrow,

01:47.723 --> 01:49.390
just ahead of your preliminary examination,

01:49.424 --> 01:51.559
which will determine whether
or not your case goes to trial.

01:51.593 --> 01:54.228
Is your sister trying to sway opinion?

01:54.262 --> 01:56.464
She's just showing support.

01:56.498 --> 01:59.834
She claims city leaders are
conspiring to prevent the rally.

01:59.868 --> 02:01.068
Why would they do that?

02:01.103 --> 02:02.737
I don't know.

02:02.771 --> 02:06.507
If hundreds of African-American
protestors get arrested,

02:06.541 --> 02:09.342
it's news, and that's good for you.

02:10.946 --> 02:11.979
How is that good?

02:12.014 --> 02:14.982
Doesn't that take attention
away from your crime?

02:16.918 --> 02:19.086
We've seen this in other
situations recently...

02:19.121 --> 02:23.891
Outside agitators being
brought in to start violence.

02:23.925 --> 02:24.892
[Sighs]

02:24.926 --> 02:26.927
You know...

02:26.962 --> 02:29.764
This isn't working for me.

02:29.798 --> 02:30.631
Come on. Let's go.

02:30.665 --> 02:32.566
Is this what we can expect tomorrow?

02:32.601 --> 02:34.502
Is your sister agitating for violence?

02:34.536 --> 02:36.470
Is that what she wants?

The social-media response

02:56.425 --> 02:58.759
has been more than we could've hoped for.

02:58.794 --> 03:02.363
Two buses from stockton,
another group coming from Oakland.

03:02.397 --> 03:04.065
Where do you expect to park these buses?

03:04.099 --> 03:05.366
Aliyah: We'll find a lot.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.134
And we need facilities for these folks...

03:07.169 --> 03:08.969
Someplace for them to use the bathroom.

03:09.004 --> 03:10.871
- Portable toilets.
- They're not free.

03:10.906 --> 03:12.106
We'll do some fundraising.

03:12.140 --> 03:13.374
In the next 24 hours?

03:13.408 --> 03:14.775
That's how much time we have.

03:14.810 --> 03:16.277
We have to talk about food.

03:16.311 --> 03:18.112
How are we gonna feed all these people?

03:18.146 --> 03:19.814
They're soldiers. They can handle it.

03:19.848 --> 03:21.982
They're not soldiers. They're supporters.

03:22.017 --> 03:23.050
What are the numbers?

03:23.085 --> 03:25.920
We're near 200 marchers.

03:25.954 --> 03:28.622
Look... I know you want to make a statement,

03:28.657 --> 03:32.293

charging your son as an adult.

What are you gonna do to stop him?

03:51.247 --> 03:53.081
I really don't know what I can tell you.

03:53.115 --> 03:55.216
You can tell me how
you're gonna help my son.

03:55.251 --> 03:56.251
You seen the video?

03:56.285 --> 03:58.386
It's self-incriminating.
It makes things difficult.

03:58.420 --> 04:01.089
And it makes it very difficult
that it's playing everywhere.

04:01.123 --> 04:02.524

04:04.226 --> 04:05.193
H-he's a thug.

He was being held by
one of Tony's accomplices

son is if you can help <i>me.</i>

No.

04:45.768 --> 04:48.637
I can't go to prison.

04:48.671 --> 04:52.440
They give you maybe three
years. You do half of that.

you ain't a bitch no more.

you laid that boy out.

08:40.363 --> 08:42.798
This is a courtesy call
to inform the families

08:42.832 --> 08:45.667
that the office will be offering
a plea deal to Carter Nix

08:45.701 --> 08:47.536

08:47.570 --> 08:49.704

signing off on any deal.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.045
That's all the information I have.

just a courtesy call.

09:03.686 --> 09:05.353
Rick: We're not offering him forgiveness.

09:05.388 --> 09:07.556
The plea agreement we're
putting in front of Carter Nix

09:07.590 --> 09:08.690
is 25 years to life.

09:08.724 --> 09:09.691
It's a serious sentence.

09:09.725 --> 09:12.160
He'll be eligible for
parole in half that time.

09:12.195 --> 09:13.161
My son was 32.

09:13.196 --> 09:16.064
He took away 40 years of his life, 50 years?

09:16.098 --> 09:19.234
That... that man who
killed him deserves to die.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.169
I understand your feelings, Ms. Hanlon.

09:21.204 --> 09:23.338
You offer up this... deal,
and you understand how I feel?

09:23.372 --> 09:25.207
In the time since your son was killed,

09:25.241 --> 09:27.042
we've had eight more murders in the county.

09:27.076 --> 09:29.744
Are you too busy to prosecute the case?

09:29.779 --> 09:31.012
We prosecute cases we can win.

09:31.047 --> 09:32.347
What we have against Nix is circumstantial.

09:32.381 --> 09:35.016
- No! No, it's not.
- If we can get a deal instead of a jury trial,

09:35.051 --> 09:37.686
- It's the same case you've always had. Always.
- We'll all be better for it.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.187
- You have the gun now.
- What we have is one witness

09:39.222 --> 09:42.057
- you didn't have the gun before.
- That can tie the gun to Carter Nix.

09:42.091 --> 09:44.659
Having the gun gives us leverage
in reaching an agreement.

09:44.694 --> 09:46.094
It doesn't guarantee anything.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.096
I would think it puts you in the position

09:48.130 --> 09:50.065
of being able to take the case to trial.

09:50.099 --> 09:53.001
Could you explain to Ms. Hanlon
that the majority of cases,

09:53.035 --> 09:55.170
no matter how severe, never get to trial?

09:55.204 --> 09:56.037
Never.

09:56.072 --> 09:59.841
If we go to the preliminary examination

09:59.876 --> 10:01.877
and the judge tosses this case,

10:01.911 --> 10:04.446
if you think 25 years to life is nothing,

10:04.480 --> 10:07.082
how are you going to feel
if the case is dismissed?

10:09.285 --> 10:11.186
You're caving.

10:12.889 --> 10:16.057
This march, all these
people coming to Modesto...

10:16.092 --> 10:17.192
You're afraid of them.

10:17.226 --> 10:18.026
I'm not.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.427
I'm not agreeing to any plea offer.

10:19.462 --> 10:20.695
We don't need your permission.

10:20.730 --> 10:21.863
To be frank,

10:21.898 --> 10:24.866
the coverage of your family's
less-than-ideal behavior

10:24.901 --> 10:28.703
has put added pressure on
my office to make this deal.

10:28.738 --> 10:31.273
Damn you.

10:31.307 --> 10:33.675
Seriously... damn you.

10:35.745 --> 10:37.112
[Door opens]

10:37.146 --> 10:39.748
He's gutless. I've known
it from the beginning.

10:39.782 --> 10:42.317
He's right. Most cases
don't make it to trial.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.120
He's afraid of that march.
He needs to be afraid of <i>us.</i>

10:45.154 --> 10:47.088
Not afraid. He needs to support us.

10:47.123 --> 10:49.124
He wouldn't have called this a hate crime

10:49.158 --> 10:51.459
if we hadn't gone public, so we have to...

10:51.494 --> 10:53.395
We have to organize like they are.

10:53.429 --> 10:54.396
We should...

10:54.430 --> 10:55.230
Organize how?

10:55.264 --> 10:57.499
We should have our own demonstration...

10:57.533 --> 10:59.267
Same place at the same time.

10:59.302 --> 11:01.303
No, they have had weeks to get ready.

11:01.337 --> 11:03.338
To do what? To bus in a lot of people?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.240
To wear head scarves and act scary?

11:05.274 --> 11:08.009
We're in the right. I'm not
gonna let people forget that.

11:08.044 --> 11:11.112
Little: 25 to life with
the possibility of parole

11:11.147 --> 11:11.980
if you plead guilty

11:12.014 --> 11:14.749
to second-degree murder/manslaughter.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.153
Parole after how many years?

11:18.187 --> 11:19.054
Maybe 15.

11:19.088 --> 11:22.824
If convicted, you face the death penalty.

11:22.858 --> 11:25.760
They have a witness testimony.
They have the gun.

11:25.795 --> 11:28.697
You think I should take it?

11:28.731 --> 11:30.665
I'm telling you what you're looking at.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.767
This is the best deal you're gonna get...

11:32.802 --> 11:34.402
Safer than the jury.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.117
I'm tired.

11:51.988 --> 11:54.089
I just want it to be over.

11:56.325 --> 11:59.094
Y-y-you've done everything that you could.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.332
But you show up with your people,

12:04.367 --> 12:07.502
it's gonna be bad out there.

12:07.536 --> 12:10.505
They're gonna put everything
I deserve on <i>you.</i>

12:12.508 --> 12:14.809
15 years?

12:14.844 --> 12:15.977
I can handle that.

12:16.012 --> 12:16.745
No.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.213
Just end it.

12:18.247 --> 12:19.581
No!

12:19.615 --> 12:22.350
[Sighs]

12:22.385 --> 12:24.352
Look, you're my lawyer. Take the deal.

12:24.387 --> 12:26.488
Carter, you've already
tried to kill yourself once.

12:26.522 --> 12:28.857
What... two years, five years in prison

12:28.891 --> 12:30.258
before you try to do it again?

12:30.292 --> 12:32.527
- You're not well.
- You don't understand, okay?

12:32.561 --> 12:34.763
You either walk out of
here free or you're dead.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.265
Because if you're convicted,
that victim's mother,

12:37.299 --> 12:40.068
she's gonna do whatever she can
to make sure you're executed.

12:40.102 --> 12:41.770
Aliyah, I can't take it anymore.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.005
No, no, no. Don't give up. Don't give up.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.241
- I can't take it.
- Don't take the plea deal.

13:07.563 --> 13:08.596
Okay.

13:08.631 --> 13:11.299
<i>Al hum du illah.</i>

13:11.333 --> 13:12.400
[Sighs]

13:12.435 --> 13:14.402
[Breathes shakily]

13:23.105 --> 13:24.105
Lisa!

13:24.140 --> 13:25.907
Hey! Hi.

13:25.942 --> 13:27.575
[Chuckling] Hi.

13:27.610 --> 13:28.610
[Car alarm chirps]

13:28.644 --> 13:31.947
So, um, sorry to hear
about you losing your job.

13:31.981 --> 13:34.783
Misunderstanding. Nobody's fault.

13:34.817 --> 13:36.151
- You look good.
- Oh.

13:36.185 --> 13:39.287
That color... that color
looks pretty on you.

13:39.322 --> 13:41.723
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:41.757 --> 13:43.258
I...

13:43.292 --> 13:46.127
I was wondering if, after
work, maybe we could get...

13:46.162 --> 13:47.729
No.

13:47.763 --> 13:49.998
You know, I just wanted to talk,

13:50.032 --> 13:52.267
you know, like we did before... Swap drama.

13:52.301 --> 13:55.136
- I got some pretty good drama I need...
- No.

13:56.372 --> 13:58.640
It's not true... That garbage they're saying

13:58.674 --> 14:00.608
about my family, uh, in the news.

14:00.643 --> 14:01.609
It's...

14:01.644 --> 14:03.178
Okay.

14:03.212 --> 14:05.146
Hey.

14:07.049 --> 14:10.251
I just want to talk.

14:10.286 --> 14:12.153
You ran out on your family,

14:12.188 --> 14:14.589
and you lied about being in jail.

14:14.623 --> 14:17.993
Let's just... let's just
leave it at that, okay?

14:21.030 --> 14:23.298
Therapist: Get that right foot. There we go.

14:23.332 --> 14:25.100
Now, s... Pushing through it.

14:25.134 --> 14:26.968
You're doing good. You're strong.

14:27.003 --> 14:28.570
There we go. [Gwen grunts]

14:28.604 --> 14:30.872
Don't let this hold you back. Keep going.

14:30.906 --> 14:33.174
Right foot. Right. There we go.

14:33.209 --> 14:35.877
Make it solid. Now get that left foot up.

14:35.911 --> 14:37.212
There we go. Good.

14:37.246 --> 14:38.213
Good.

14:38.247 --> 14:39.681
Take a deep breath.

14:39.715 --> 14:40.749
[Breathes deeply]

14:40.783 --> 14:43.885
All right, there we go.
Let's keep going. Walker.

14:43.919 --> 14:45.286
- Now the left.
- Oh!

14:45.321 --> 14:46.354
You got it. You got it.

14:46.389 --> 14:49.758
Barb: It's about Gwen. I
want this to be about Gwen.

14:49.792 --> 14:51.259
People have written about her.

14:51.293 --> 14:53.461
They've talked about her every possible way.

14:53.496 --> 14:55.096
- Yes.
- But since this has happened,

14:55.131 --> 14:57.132
she hasn't had a chance
to speak for herself.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.467
She can't really speak for
herself. She has aphasia.

14:59.502 --> 15:01.469
Then for someone to speak for her properly.

15:01.504 --> 15:04.606
This is your chance to have
a march in Gwen's name.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.041
She can't walk.

15:06.075 --> 15:08.043
To have an <i>event</i> for her.

15:08.077 --> 15:09.411
I don't... Please don't be literal.

15:09.445 --> 15:10.545
We're doing everything we can

15:10.579 --> 15:13.481
to keep Gwen from knowing
what's being said about her.

15:13.516 --> 15:16.484
We're not letting our daughter
get dragged around in public.

15:16.519 --> 15:18.349
We're not gonna make some
kind of exhibition out of her.

15:18.349 --> 15:21.623
If you don't, the man who killed
my son is gonna walk out of jail.

15:21.657 --> 15:22.957
- Or they'll give him a deal.
- Tom and I,

15:22.992 --> 15:26.061
- we have prayed on this.
- Or they're going to... to let him off.

15:26.095 --> 15:27.762
God!

15:27.797 --> 15:30.065
Why is it so wrong to ask for guidance?

15:30.099 --> 15:32.233
You want us to put our daughter on display

15:32.268 --> 15:34.335
just to fix what you've wrecked?

15:34.370 --> 15:37.238
You have your daughter. My son is dead.

15:37.273 --> 15:38.907
We're not letting Gwen get dragged out

15:38.941 --> 15:40.642
like some sad, pathetic victim.

15:40.676 --> 15:43.344
If people could see Gwen,
they'll see the truth.

15:43.379 --> 15:45.313
She's Miss Modesto, for God's sake.

15:45.347 --> 15:48.349
If Matt had lived and Gwen had
died, would you do this to him?

15:48.384 --> 15:50.485
I made a bad mistake with Gwen before.

15:50.519 --> 15:52.454
I'm not gonna make another one.

15:52.488 --> 15:54.322
Can...

15:54.356 --> 15:55.857
Can we talk to Tom about this?

15:55.891 --> 15:58.159
I said no, and that's how it's going to be.

16:08.171 --> 16:09.571
Richelle: Have you been avoiding me?

16:09.606 --> 16:12.841
Russ: Uh, Mark made it pretty clear
he didn't want me around right now.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.977
I left you messages.
I invited you out to lunch.

16:15.011 --> 16:16.144
Congratulations, though.

16:16.179 --> 16:20.115
Mark's... I'm sure you're
gonna do real well together.

16:20.149 --> 16:21.883
I think so. I hope so.

16:21.918 --> 16:22.985
He's a good kid.

16:24.821 --> 16:26.888
You're not answering my question.

16:26.923 --> 16:28.357
Have you been avoiding me?

16:28.391 --> 16:29.992
Hm.

16:32.428 --> 16:35.364
When Mark's brother got married,

16:35.398 --> 16:38.500
he... he went through the
trouble of inviting me.

16:38.534 --> 16:41.336
And that's how it was, too... trouble.

16:41.371 --> 16:45.707
Barb didn't want me around.
Gwen's parents tolerated me.

16:45.742 --> 16:47.042
Not a lot more important

16:47.076 --> 16:49.811
than seeing your own boy give his vows.

16:49.846 --> 16:53.815
I really wanted to be there.

16:53.850 --> 16:55.317
But I knew better.

16:55.351 --> 16:58.153
It's the same way now.

16:58.187 --> 17:00.489
I mean, I...

17:00.523 --> 17:02.924
I know better than to come around.

17:02.959 --> 17:07.362
Yeah, but you did get
invited. You could've gone.

17:07.396 --> 17:08.930
Let me ask you something.

17:08.964 --> 17:10.766
When you skipped the wedding,

17:10.800 --> 17:13.502
you think you were trying
to make more of a statement

17:13.536 --> 17:15.470
by <i>not</i> being there than by showing up?

17:17.339 --> 17:18.640
I, uh...

17:18.675 --> 17:20.375
[Lock beeps, clicks]

17:21.743 --> 17:23.779
- [Clears throat]
- Hey.

17:27.784 --> 17:29.685
Russ came to see you.

17:29.719 --> 17:31.153
You guys want to talk alone?

17:31.187 --> 17:33.388
No. You're fine. Um, we don't need to talk.

17:33.423 --> 17:35.724
Russ, would you like a minute with your son?

17:35.758 --> 17:36.558
Thank you.

17:40.763 --> 17:42.064
Okay. [Smooches]

17:44.567 --> 17:46.735
What do you need?

17:46.769 --> 17:48.604
Okay, well, um...

17:48.638 --> 17:50.839
I've come to ask a favor.

17:50.874 --> 17:52.040
I lost my job.

17:52.075 --> 17:55.410
You know, there's a smear
campaign against all of us...

17:55.445 --> 17:57.613
Mainly against Matt and Gwen, but...

17:57.647 --> 17:59.014
Yeah, you can't stay here.

17:59.048 --> 18:01.917
No, no, no. I-I wouldn't
ask that. I-I'm not...

18:01.951 --> 18:04.186
That's not what I'm asking.
I don't want to intrude.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.688
I was hoping that...

18:06.723 --> 18:09.458
I was thinking that, you
know, maybe I, you know,

18:09.492 --> 18:11.627
could help fix up Matt and Gwen's place

18:11.661 --> 18:14.730
in exchange for staying there.

18:16.332 --> 18:20.802
You want to sleep in the
house where Matt was killed?

18:20.837 --> 18:23.138
You know, i-it's funny.

18:23.172 --> 18:25.707
I was just... I was thinking that,

18:25.742 --> 18:27.709
you know, maybe it would...
It would make me...

18:27.744 --> 18:30.145
Help me feel, you know, closer to him.

18:30.179 --> 18:32.814
I don't know. Is that
weird? I don't know. I...

18:32.849 --> 18:36.818
You know, maybe this is a way I can help.

18:36.853 --> 18:38.220
Well, it's not up to me.

18:38.254 --> 18:39.788
You're gonna have to ask Tom and Eve.

18:39.822 --> 18:42.958
Yeah, we're not on real good terms.

18:42.992 --> 18:45.561
I was... I was hoping you could ask <i>for</i> me.

18:51.367 --> 18:53.502
Just let it go.

18:53.536 --> 18:56.138
Okay? It's over for you here.

18:59.275 --> 19:01.476
I'm not leaving again.

19:03.212 --> 19:05.647
You don't know.

19:05.682 --> 19:06.848
[Sighs]

19:06.883 --> 19:07.849
You don't.

19:07.884 --> 19:09.251
When you're a father,

19:09.285 --> 19:11.820
you're a father the rest
of your life. All right?

19:11.854 --> 19:13.455
And if you're gonna start a family,

19:13.489 --> 19:15.691
- that's something...
- Hey, don't talk to me about family.

19:15.725 --> 19:17.159
That's something that you need to learn.

19:17.193 --> 19:20.262
- You have no idea what family means.
- It doesn't go away, all right?

19:20.296 --> 19:21.830
- You don't even...
- And... and... and...

19:21.864 --> 19:25.467
- And making that house nice for Gwen is something.
- Yes, staying there for free.

19:26.703 --> 19:28.203
It's something.

19:28.237 --> 19:32.774
And right now, where I am...

19:32.809 --> 19:34.376
I need something.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.816
If you can find more people
to make more posters.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.784
Thank you.

They don't get <i>in.</i>

20:03.106 --> 20:04.406
We have to go.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.407
Go where?

20:05.441 --> 20:08.543
Everybody needs to leave
the building right now.

20:08.578 --> 20:10.846
Come on. Let's go.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.914
Come on, Aliyah.

[Siren wailing in distance]

20:29.866 --> 20:32.367
There's no bomb.

20:32.402 --> 20:33.869
There's no bomb in there.

20:33.903 --> 20:35.771
Somebody just wants to scare us.

20:35.805 --> 20:37.739
Or disrupt us.

20:51.334 --> 20:54.170
Barb: If you know people... if...

20:54.204 --> 20:56.805
If there are people you
could reach out to...

20:56.836 --> 20:57.936
- It's for tomorrow?
- Yes.

20:57.970 --> 20:59.905
= That's really fast.
- There's going to be reporters.

20:59.939 --> 21:02.274
I can't let those people be
the only ones on the news.

21:02.308 --> 21:03.809
Anyone... Anyone who can come out...

21:03.843 --> 21:06.244
- My husband and I are members of a group.
- Okay.

21:06.279 --> 21:08.647
I'm pretty sure we can
get people to come out.

21:08.681 --> 21:09.414
That's great.

21:09.449 --> 21:12.350
The Central Valley Rainbow Works.

21:12.385 --> 21:14.286
This is wonderful. Thank you.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.421
We're not that big, but
we do have association

21:16.456 --> 21:19.591
with a lot of other
like-minded organizations.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.592
"Rainbow Works."

21:20.626 --> 21:22.861
God keeps all the colors
of the rainbow separate,

21:22.895 --> 21:26.164
just like we need to
keep our races separate.

21:28.074 --> 21:29.874
W-what do you mean separate?

21:29.909 --> 21:32.744
They have their areas, and we have ours.

21:32.778 --> 21:33.912
Segregation?

21:33.946 --> 21:35.914
Separation.

21:35.948 --> 21:38.883
[Sighing] I don't believe in that.

21:38.918 --> 21:41.319
Of all the times we've spent
and the way you've talked,

21:41.353 --> 21:43.455
I-I thought you had the
right idea about how...

21:43.489 --> 21:45.790
What right idea? That man killed my son.

21:45.825 --> 21:47.892
He should die. That's not racist.

21:47.927 --> 21:50.729
With separation, that wouldn't be a problem.

21:50.763 --> 21:52.897
Do you want our help or not?

21:56.001 --> 21:58.737
Alonzo: They're desperate
right now. We have to use that.

21:58.771 --> 22:01.005
Tony: "Use that" how?

22:01.040 --> 22:04.109
They want to convict the black guy, Nix.

22:04.143 --> 22:06.244
They want him badly.

22:06.278 --> 22:08.947
But, oh, the other guy, the
illegal you gave our car to,

22:08.981 --> 22:09.848
they let him off.

22:11.884 --> 22:13.785
Now, they would do the same for <i>you,</i>

22:13.819 --> 22:16.121
but you have to give them
something they can use.

22:16.155 --> 22:17.155
I don't know anything.

22:17.189 --> 22:19.524
You have to know something, <i>mijo.</i> You...

22:19.558 --> 22:20.391
I didn't do anything.

22:20.426 --> 22:24.629
I know. I know you didn't do anything.

22:24.663 --> 22:26.631
But you were hanging around the illegal.

22:26.665 --> 22:28.700
- Maybe he said something.
- No.

22:28.734 --> 22:30.034
Something about Nix,

22:30.069 --> 22:31.870
a-about killing the veteran and the wife.

22:31.904 --> 22:34.806
He didn't say anything. He
didn't say anything about it.

22:36.142 --> 22:39.010
But...

22:39.044 --> 22:41.946
There has to be something
that you can tell them.

22:45.084 --> 22:46.851
Just...

22:46.886 --> 22:49.220
Tell them that you know the
black guy killed the war vet.

22:49.255 --> 22:50.989
How would I know that?

22:51.023 --> 22:53.358
From the guy you gave our car to.

22:57.530 --> 22:59.063
You want me to lie?

22:59.098 --> 23:02.000
They've <i>all</i> lied. All of them have lied.

23:02.034 --> 23:03.684
You told me to tell the truth.
The police have lied.

23:03.684 --> 23:04.784
- You told me...
- The other families have lied.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.372
Now I'm telling you <i>this.</i>

23:07.406 --> 23:11.910
We have to do this now... Today.

23:11.944 --> 23:14.979
They're scared right now
because of the protest march.

23:15.014 --> 23:16.881
Okay? And they're ready to settle.

23:16.916 --> 23:20.485
If they do that, we lose our chance.

23:20.519 --> 23:23.488
We only have one chance, mijo.

23:23.522 --> 23:24.422
Tony.

23:26.759 --> 23:30.929
So we have to come up
with a plan... our story.

23:30.963 --> 23:32.764
Okay? So, he comes back to the shop...

23:32.798 --> 23:35.600
If the police need somebody to lie so bad,

23:35.634 --> 23:39.170
maybe the guy didn't do anything... like me.

23:39.205 --> 23:41.206
Have you thought about that?

23:43.876 --> 23:45.877
You can't help me.

23:47.980 --> 23:50.148
I got to take care of <i>myself.</i>

- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

24:26.018 --> 24:26.918
Why you even come?

24:26.952 --> 24:30.455
It's the only way I can lay eyes on you...

24:30.489 --> 24:32.590
When you're locked down in jail.

24:32.625 --> 24:36.427
What the... is wrong with you, Hector?

24:36.462 --> 24:38.930
You lie and lie.

I try over and over.

24:47.106 --> 24:48.239
I don't want money.

24:48.274 --> 24:50.375
I couldn't give you anything else.

25:25.377 --> 25:27.478
That's who you ran from.

25:29.315 --> 25:31.783
I-I-I didn't run.

25:31.817 --> 25:33.484
They were gonna put a murder on me.

25:33.519 --> 25:35.153

me, and that's all they see.

You're too busy banging to be there for me,

do right, it goes bad.
