We can set up groups
of canisters...

14:38.781 --> 14:41.715
And create explosions
that take them out
a wave at a time.

14:41.717 --> 14:45.019
How will you get the creatures
close enough to the rhydonium
to be effective?

14:45.021 --> 14:47.955
We're gonna need bait.
Where do we get that?

14:47.957 --> 14:50.024
We don't get it.
We are it.

15:16.051 --> 15:19.053
[ creatures snarling ]

15:19.055 --> 15:21.088
Wave one. Move.

15:28.430 --> 15:31.365
[ screeching, growling ]

15:35.103 --> 15:37.204
[ screeching ]

15:42.410 --> 15:43.477
[ gasps ]

15:46.181 --> 15:48.148
Wow. A lot of 'em.

15:48.150 --> 15:50.751
Steady now.
Follow the plan.

15:59.327 --> 16:01.161
Fall back! Wave two.

16:07.435 --> 16:09.203
Wait for 'em.

16:15.010 --> 16:16.076
Now!

16:20.982 --> 16:23.150
It worked.
We just might survive this.

16:23.152 --> 16:25.819
Wait. You doubted
your own plan?
Never.

16:25.821 --> 16:27.388
Good, 'cause I sure did.
Hey!

16:30.058 --> 16:31.825
Come on.
They're closing in.

16:31.827 --> 16:33.827
Wave three.

16:46.408 --> 16:49.376
Wave four. Incoming!

16:49.378 --> 16:52.112
[ chuckles ]
oh. Did I mention
there are a lot of 'em?

16:52.114 --> 16:53.414
[ hera ]
sounds familiar.

17:06.094 --> 17:07.493
Light it up.

17:22.077 --> 17:23.977
Coming in
from both sides.

17:23.979 --> 17:25.346
What about wave five?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.981
We didn't have a plan
for wave five.

17:27.983 --> 17:29.583
Afraid of that.
The <i> phantom?</i>

17:29.585 --> 17:31.485
Not inside.
Go up top.

17:39.627 --> 17:41.228
They just keep coming!

17:43.231 --> 17:44.998
Tell me something
I don't know.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.068
- We're going to die.
- That's no secret.

18:15.997 --> 18:18.365
The light's not hurting them.
Then we better move.

18:26.441 --> 18:29.076
Sabine! I got your back.

18:34.048 --> 18:35.983
These guys aren't so tough.

18:38.386 --> 18:40.154
- Whoa!
- [ screeches ]

18:40.156 --> 18:41.522
Whoa! Oh!

18:44.559 --> 18:45.459
<i>Karabast!</i>

18:55.437 --> 18:58.172
[ creature screeches ]
kid, come on!

19:01.142 --> 19:03.177
Nice moves out there, champ.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.154
Chopper! Close her up!

19:14.156 --> 19:16.457
[ droid language ]

19:21.663 --> 19:24.264
[ growls ]
no hitchhikers!

19:31.172 --> 19:32.539
<i>[ zeb ]</i>
<i>kanan, we're all aboard.</i>

19:32.541 --> 19:35.008
Something's wrong.
She's not responding.

19:35.010 --> 19:37.644
Rerouting auxiliary power
to the hull.

19:42.083 --> 19:43.584
Didn't know
the <i> ghost </i> could do that.

19:43.586 --> 19:45.986
There's a lot you don't know
about my ship.

19:45.988 --> 19:47.688
Chopper, reroute coolant
to the engine.

19:47.690 --> 19:49.690
[ droid language ]

19:49.692 --> 19:51.291
Thanks for saving me
back there.

19:51.293 --> 19:53.126
Don't read too much
into it, kid.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.033
<i>[ hera ]</i>
<i>engaging magnetic lock.</i>

20:21.089 --> 20:25.292
Look, hera, I'm sorry about not
checking the diagnostic.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.494
We're all sorry.
Right, chopper?

20:27.496 --> 20:29.563
[ droid language ]

20:29.565 --> 20:33.066
Anyway,
we'll fix the <i> phantom.</i>
Don't even worry about it.

20:33.068 --> 20:35.168
Now, why would I worry?

20:35.170 --> 20:38.038
Mmm. Maybe because
the last time they "fixed" it,

20:38.040 --> 20:39.439
We nearly wound up
as lunch?

20:39.441 --> 20:41.775
Oh, right. That's why.

20:51.219 --> 20:53.820
Sabine, I know
you have questions,

20:53.822 --> 20:56.156
Questions I can't answer
right now.

20:56.158 --> 20:57.791
But know that I trust you.

20:57.793 --> 21:00.427
I just trusted you
with my life down there.

21:00.429 --> 21:04.064
I know.
I know you do.

21:04.066 --> 21:07.267
Good. We are making
a difference, sabine.

21:07.269 --> 21:11.238
And I promise: We won't always
be fighting this battle alone.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.806
Do you think you can trust me?

21:12.808 --> 21:15.275
I think I can try.
