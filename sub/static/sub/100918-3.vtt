No, Jordan.

Can you change
the radio station?

04:28.028 --> 04:29.865

Family dinner
is tonight at 6:30.

04:42.043 --> 04:43.480
I'm thinking
I'll make fish,

maybe some salmon
or a nice tilapia.

04:45.814 --> 04:47.985

Don't drive me to school.

05:01.930 --> 05:03.031
What? Why not?

05:03.064 --> 05:04.064
Because we have to find

05:04.064 --> 05:06.035
the rest of

05:06.035 --> 05:07.504
They've probably assumed
new identities

05:07.504 --> 05:08.939

05:08.971 --> 05:11.641
Okay, weren't you even
a little scared
of Brainwave?

05:11.675 --> 05:15.011
I mean, we both
could have been killed.

05:15.043 --> 05:16.745
But we weren't,

05:16.778 --> 05:20.382
and as crazy
and insane as it was,

05:20.415 --> 05:22.151
it was the first time
since we moved

05:22.185 --> 05:24.252
to Blue Valley that I

05:24.286 --> 05:26.656
felt like I was
in the right place.

is not being one

-I need to find out
if Brainwave was alone or not

05:53.449 --> 05:55.250

-I'm sure that he is.
-Mmm.

11:47.436 --> 11:49.038
Well, where did
they find him?

11:49.072 --> 11:51.240
Just outside
the emergency entrance.

11:51.273 --> 11:52.774
Right.

11:52.807 --> 11:57.211
So, what did
he have on?

11:57.245 --> 11:59.916
His lab coat.

11:59.947 --> 12:02.750
Right. 'Course. Yeah.

Brainwave is in a coma.

12:39.589 --> 12:42.288

12:44.826 --> 12:49.826
His son was attacked
by someone using
Starman's staff.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.302
He told me
he called you.

12:53.335 --> 12:56.138
He did.

12:56.171 --> 12:59.408
Why didn't you?

12:59.442 --> 13:02.740
I didn't see the need.

13:05.278 --> 13:08.431
Take a seat, William.

13:19.326 --> 13:22.062
What did Brainwave
tell you about this new

13:22.096 --> 13:24.230
Starman?

13:24.264 --> 13:27.600
It was a girl.

13:27.634 --> 13:28.903
That he'd
take care of her.

13:28.937 --> 13:30.307
You were the one
who was supposed

13:30.307 --> 13:32.807
-to handle things
in my absence.
-Well, he was insistent.

13:32.841 --> 13:34.878
And you were hesitant.

13:34.908 --> 13:37.913
You always have been.

13:37.947 --> 13:42.947
Brainwave has never been
a team player like me.

13:43.418 --> 13:46.620
I was the one
who cleaned everything up.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.225
Got him to the hospital,

13:48.258 --> 13:50.359
took care of the costume,
came up with a story.

13:50.393 --> 13:51.692
William...

13:51.725 --> 13:54.163
[sighs deeply]

13:54.197 --> 13:57.399
...you stumbled
into your powers...

13:57.432 --> 13:58.500
you killed your master

13:58.500 --> 14:00.092
before his lessons
were complete,

14:00.092 --> 14:02.302
and it shows.

14:02.339 --> 14:04.639
That wand of yours,
it's capable of so much more,

14:04.673 --> 14:06.176
but instead of thinking big,

14:06.206 --> 14:09.546
you just continue
to think small.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.215
Even now
you're still performing
the same old tired show.

14:12.249 --> 14:16.384
You've just changed
one stage for another.

14:16.418 --> 14:19.288
You spend your days
making promises to people,

14:19.322 --> 14:22.057
but much like
every politician,
you don't keep them,

14:22.091 --> 14:24.759
in the same way
you didn't keep
your promise to me.

14:24.793 --> 14:27.431
-Jordan, that is--
-You seem to think that power

14:27.464 --> 14:30.267
comes from other people's
perception of you.

14:30.298 --> 14:33.067
From recognition
or applause, but...

14:33.100 --> 14:35.071
That's not true power.

14:35.105 --> 14:38.041
Now, William,
true power doesn't
need to be seen.

14:38.072 --> 14:41.043
I've traveled
across this country.

14:41.076 --> 14:43.113
I've hunted down everybody

14:43.144 --> 14:45.215
who played a part
in Christine's death.

14:45.248 --> 14:47.514
Everybody who exposed her
to the toxin

14:47.548 --> 14:49.283
that led her to get sick.

14:49.283 --> 14:50.283
And I did this

14:50.283 --> 14:52.754
because I, too, made
a promise, William,

14:52.788 --> 14:54.855
to my wife
as she lay dying

14:54.889 --> 14:55.923
in my bed

14:55.956 --> 14:59.158
that I would
combat injustice

14:59.192 --> 15:00.964
for our son,

15:00.995 --> 15:03.432
for everyone's children.

15:03.466 --> 15:07.056
There's nothing more important
to me than mine.

15:18.614 --> 15:20.447
Good.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.519
Good.

15:23.552 --> 15:26.956
It's the way
it should be.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.859
Project: New America
is my destiny.

15:29.892 --> 15:33.596
I want it
to be yours, too.

15:33.629 --> 15:37.066
But I'm back
in charge now...

15:37.100 --> 15:41.336
and I'll take care
of this Stargirl.

15:41.370 --> 15:43.769
[drill whirring]

15:52.048 --> 15:54.750
[phone ringing]

15:54.783 --> 15:59.388
Comin'. Comin'.

15:59.421 --> 16:02.024
Yeah?

16:02.057 --> 16:06.696
Yes, I'm Mike Dugan's father.

16:06.729 --> 16:08.465
He what?

16:08.498 --> 16:12.000
No, Mike,
I think they have
enough evidence on you.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.302
What am I supposed
to do in my room
without my games?

16:14.336 --> 16:16.706
You know, I was in the middle
of real important work, Mike,

16:16.740 --> 16:19.173
and when I was your age,
we weren't playing
games in class.

16:19.206 --> 16:20.442
Yeah, back in your day,

16:20.475 --> 16:22.644
-you didn't have any video--
-You see,

16:22.677 --> 16:23.913
that's where
you're wrong.

16:23.946 --> 16:25.715
It was actually
the golden age
of video games

16:25.748 --> 16:27.450
and I was down
at the arcade

16:27.484 --> 16:29.884
playing <i>Asteroids,</i>
<i>Donkey Kong, Dig Dug,</i>

16:29.918 --> 16:32.922
<i>Defender, Spy Hunter,</i>
you name it.

16:32.955 --> 16:34.490
But my personal favorite

16:34.524 --> 16:37.927
was made by the Rolls-Royce
of video game manufacturers.

16:37.961 --> 16:39.229
Atari.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.663
-A what?
-The game was
called <i>Paperboy,</i> Mike,

16:41.697 --> 16:43.932
and I used
to play it all day,

16:43.966 --> 16:45.368
every day,

16:45.399 --> 16:47.802
until one afternoon
my father came to me
and he said--

16:47.836 --> 16:49.072
You were adopted.

16:49.105 --> 16:51.072
[chuckles] No.

16:51.105 --> 16:52.408
He said, "Son,

16:52.442 --> 16:55.979
you need to stop
feeding quarters
into that machine

16:56.009 --> 16:58.181
and go make some money
of your own.

16:58.214 --> 17:00.484
You like
this game <i>Paperboy,</i>

17:00.517 --> 17:03.820
how about you
try the real thing?"

17:03.850 --> 17:05.554
So, he got me
a paper route.

17:05.586 --> 17:07.086
Does this story
ever end

17:07.123 --> 17:10.557
-or does it just keep
going on forever?
-It continues.

17:10.593 --> 17:12.528
It doesn't have
an ending

17:12.557 --> 17:13.663
because you, Mike Dugan,

17:13.693 --> 17:18.693
are gonna take up
that great family tradition.

17:19.669 --> 17:22.269
You're getting
a paper route.

17:22.269 --> 17:23.269
Yeah.

17:33.779 --> 17:37.653
Hmm. [chuckles]

17:37.683 --> 17:38.884
Good morning, everyone.

17:38.921 --> 17:40.190
[all] Good morning.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.391
Welcome back, sir.

17:41.423 --> 17:44.160
[Jordan] It is good
to be back, James.

17:44.192 --> 17:46.729
[clicks tongue]
And for those of you
who are new here,

17:46.759 --> 17:50.662
my name
is Jordan Mahkent.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.172
I made a promise once,

17:56.202 --> 17:58.404
a promise to someone
very special to me

17:58.441 --> 17:59.942
that I would help
make this country

17:59.976 --> 18:04.180
a better, safer place
to raise our children.

18:04.211 --> 18:07.279
I've dedicated
my life to that.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.682
Like many immigrants,
my parents came to this

18:09.720 --> 18:14.057
great country in the hope
of finding a better future
to raise their children.

18:14.086 --> 18:15.788
But this past year

18:15.825 --> 18:18.094
I have traveled
across America

18:18.125 --> 18:19.461
from town to town

18:19.496 --> 18:22.895
and I have seen factories
that are abandoned.

18:22.932 --> 18:24.932
I've met people in need,

18:24.967 --> 18:26.836
In Littleville, Colorado.

18:26.865 --> 18:28.438
In Hatton Corners, Indiana.

18:28.471 --> 18:33.307
And so many other
forgotten communities.

18:33.343 --> 18:35.009
And we're gonna
help them...

18:35.044 --> 18:37.046
just like we've
helped Blue Valley.

18:37.076 --> 18:38.748
[all murmuring]

18:38.778 --> 18:41.650
We're gonna
rebuild America.

18:41.682 --> 18:43.853
One factory

18:43.884 --> 18:47.336
and one town
at a time.

18:53.096 --> 18:54.797
But...

18:54.826 --> 18:56.096
as we expand
the vision

18:56.132 --> 18:59.335
we call The American Dream
across this great land,

18:59.365 --> 19:03.239
we'll also continue
the revitalization of downtown,

19:03.269 --> 19:05.471
which will include

19:05.508 --> 19:09.412
a food co-op
at 27 Spring Street,

19:09.442 --> 19:12.949
a brand new retail space
at 308 Main Street,

19:12.980 --> 19:15.548
-a--
-Oh.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.487
Is there a problem?

19:17.519 --> 19:22.519
-No, I'm sorry.
-No, please,
what were you gonna say?

19:22.788 --> 19:25.125
It's, um...

19:25.161 --> 19:27.130
I grew up here,
in Blue Valley.

19:27.163 --> 19:28.498
I just moved back

19:28.528 --> 19:31.000
and what you've done
to our town is amazing,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.803
it's remarkable,
and it's inspiring,

19:33.836 --> 19:34.903
and it's why I wanted

19:34.933 --> 19:36.471
to work here,

19:36.506 --> 19:39.576
but back when
I was a kid...

19:39.605 --> 19:43.509
308 Main Street
was a theater.

19:43.546 --> 19:46.249
Every weekend
we'd watch plays

19:46.278 --> 19:48.652
put on by our neighbors
and our friends.

19:48.682 --> 19:52.384
The theater has operated
at a loss for years.

19:52.422 --> 19:54.490
I'm sure it's not
very lucrative,

19:54.520 --> 19:59.520
but it brought
the community together.

20:00.028 --> 20:03.199
I'm sorry,
I said too much.

20:03.230 --> 20:05.602
You know what?

20:05.634 --> 20:08.104
That would be great
for the community.
Let's do that instead.

20:08.134 --> 20:10.673
-But we have already--
-As brilliant as you are,

20:10.707 --> 20:13.875
I'm sure you can find a way
to make that work.
Right, Stephen?

20:13.910 --> 20:16.246
Of course.

20:16.278 --> 20:17.748
Uh, Miss...

20:17.778 --> 20:22.018
-I'm... I'm sorry,
what was your name?
-Barbara. [chuckles]

20:22.048 --> 20:23.250
Barbara.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.892
[teacher over PA]
<i>Reminder, students,</i>

20:28.892 --> 20:32.661
<i>the bus for the talent show</i>
<i>leaves today at 2:45.</i>

20:32.692 --> 20:33.961
[Cindy] Yolanda?

20:33.996 --> 20:36.298
I'm talking to you.

20:36.332 --> 20:40.365
Who painted that?
Was it you?

20:40.402 --> 20:43.038
No.

20:43.038 --> 20:44.207
You should have
never dated Henry

20:44.207 --> 20:46.776
once you knew
that I liked him.

20:46.807 --> 20:48.411
You are a nobody.

20:48.442 --> 20:51.815
I am somebody,
and I'm never gonna
let you forget that.

20:51.846 --> 20:56.414
Even your own family
knows what you really are.

20:56.451 --> 20:59.055
Slut.

20:59.086 --> 21:00.221
[Courtney]
I have to say,

21:00.256 --> 21:03.192
slut-shaming is
really damaging.

21:03.192 --> 21:04.490
-[boy] Look, over there.
-Not to mention,

21:04.490 --> 21:06.797
it sets women back,
like, 50 years.

21:06.826 --> 21:10.247
Okay, well, nobody cares
what you think, new girl.

21:12.335 --> 21:15.067
-Okay, but, really,
I don't understand--
-Stop it.

21:15.104 --> 21:18.508
-What?
-Don't you get it?

21:18.508 --> 21:23.508
You're only going to
make things worse
for the both of us.

21:24.943 --> 21:27.450
[school bell ringing]

21:27.480 --> 21:29.586
[Mr. Levine] <i>You might</i>
<i>be asking yourself,</i>

21:29.615 --> 21:34.615
"When am I ever
gonna use proper
and improper fractions?"

21:35.057 --> 21:38.125
Well... the answer is,

21:38.161 --> 21:39.961
a fraction of every day.

21:39.996 --> 21:42.028
[students groan]

21:42.064 --> 21:44.034
[Mr. Levine] Tough crowd.

21:44.067 --> 21:47.336
All right.
So, mathematicians
use three categories

21:47.366 --> 21:49.701
to describe fractions.

21:49.738 --> 21:51.573
Proper,

21:51.605 --> 21:53.038
improper

21:53.075 --> 21:55.240
and mixed.

21:55.278 --> 21:57.846
Fractions that are
greater than zero

21:57.880 --> 21:59.413
but less than one...

21:59.449 --> 22:03.719
You were the one
that painted Yolanda's locker.

22:03.719 --> 22:04.653
Maybe.

22:04.653 --> 22:06.721
[Mr. Levine]
In proper fractions...

22:06.755 --> 22:09.392
I'm Courtney.

22:09.423 --> 22:11.727
-Cameron.
-I know.

22:11.727 --> 22:12.728
Uh, I mean,

22:12.728 --> 22:13.630
I'm new here, so...

22:13.630 --> 22:15.131
So, I'm trying
to learn everyone's name

22:15.131 --> 22:17.200
and since ours both
started with a C

22:17.230 --> 22:19.268
it was easy
to remember. [chuckles]

22:19.298 --> 22:21.538
Welcome to
Blue Valley, Courtney.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.506
[Mr. Levine] This is algebra,

22:23.538 --> 22:25.538
-not <i>The Dating Game.</i>
-[students exclaim]

22:25.575 --> 22:28.154
[Jenny] What's
<i>The Dating Game?</i>

22:54.103 --> 22:55.201
[knocking on door]

22:55.238 --> 22:57.373
Is now a good time?
Oh! Wow, I'm sorry.

22:57.403 --> 22:59.173
Let me help you with that.

22:59.208 --> 23:03.045
[Barbara] Shoot.

23:03.076 --> 23:04.778
Oh, is that
your daughter?

23:04.814 --> 23:08.250
Yes, that's...
that's Courtney,
my daughter,

23:08.284 --> 23:10.920
uh, and that's
my stepson, Mike,

23:10.951 --> 23:14.257
and my husband, Pat.

23:14.288 --> 23:16.057
You have
a lovely family.

23:16.092 --> 23:17.594
Thank you.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.125
Well, Barbara,
I just wanted to say--

23:19.163 --> 23:21.528
If you've changed your mind
about the theater,
I understand.

23:21.564 --> 23:23.798
Oh, no. No, no, no,
quite the opposite.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.603
I've actually set up
a task group to focus solely

23:26.634 --> 23:29.067
on the new
community theater project.

23:29.105 --> 23:32.375
Oh. That's great.

23:32.404 --> 23:33.710
Our first meeting
is at 6:30.

23:33.740 --> 23:36.808
I just wondered
if you would like to join us.

23:36.846 --> 23:39.516
[chuckles softly]

23:39.548 --> 23:42.151
Um, I would love to.

23:42.182 --> 23:43.616
But...

23:43.653 --> 23:46.653
My family and I
are having dinner together

23:46.689 --> 23:48.891
at 6:30.

23:48.923 --> 23:51.759
I totally understand.

23:51.795 --> 23:54.631
Um, maybe I can join
the next meeting?

23:54.663 --> 23:56.700
Again, I'm so sorry,
Mr. Mahkent.

23:56.730 --> 23:58.865
Oh, no, please,
don't apologize.

23:58.902 --> 24:00.804
Our country was built
on values like yours.

24:00.836 --> 24:05.270
It's just too bad
things have changed.

24:05.307 --> 24:07.843
Uh, great work, again,

24:07.875 --> 24:09.278
today, Barbara,

24:09.308 --> 24:13.509
and, please,
call me Jordan.

24:14.779 --> 24:16.730
[door closes]

24:44.144 --> 24:47.145
[wind whistling]

24:47.182 --> 24:49.432
[ice crackling]

25:07.470 --> 25:09.116
Oh, my God.

25:17.778 --> 25:18.948
Pat?

25:18.980 --> 25:21.817
[Pat] In the kitchen.

25:21.851 --> 25:23.419
[Courtney]
I was walking home
through Blue Valley Park

25:23.451 --> 25:25.519
and you'll
never guess what I saw.

25:25.555 --> 25:27.256
-What?
-I found

25:27.257 --> 25:28.257
a frozen field.

25:28.288 --> 25:30.393
-A what?
-An iced-over field

25:30.423 --> 25:32.528
and it was
in the shape
of a star.

25:32.558 --> 25:35.298
It's a message.
I know it.

25:35.327 --> 25:36.633
It's Icicle. It has to be.

25:36.663 --> 25:38.601
-Hold on,
just tell me exactly--
-He killed my dad.

25:38.634 --> 25:40.336
He killed Starman.

25:40.336 --> 25:41.700
[scoffs] We have to go
and find him.

25:41.701 --> 25:43.403
And do what?
Arrest him?

25:43.439 --> 25:44.605
That's a start.

25:44.641 --> 25:46.538
There are more of them here.
I was right.

25:46.576 --> 25:49.412
You have no idea
how dangerous he is,
all right?

25:49.412 --> 25:51.881
The only thing I've ever seen
hurt Icicle is the staff.

25:51.913 --> 25:53.548
-That's great!
-That's terrible.

25:53.548 --> 25:54.750
-[Mike] Hey.
-Mike.

25:54.750 --> 25:55.986
[Pat] What are you
doing down here?

25:55.986 --> 25:58.019
I told you to wait
in your room until dinner.

25:58.054 --> 26:00.855
Yeah, well,
my stomach
says it's dinner.

26:00.890 --> 26:03.355
Okay, well, I'm working
on this vegan casserole.

26:03.392 --> 26:05.461
Vegan casserole?

26:05.491 --> 26:06.528
Big pass.

26:06.558 --> 26:08.961
Did I interrupt
something important?

26:08.998 --> 26:10.663
No, I'm just

26:10.700 --> 26:13.567
giving Court
a couple of cooking tips.

26:13.603 --> 26:15.371
Yep, I need 'em. Mmm.

26:15.403 --> 26:16.702
[Pat] You know
what, buddy,

26:16.739 --> 26:18.173
why don't you take this,

26:18.207 --> 26:19.471
ride your bike
up to the store,

26:19.509 --> 26:20.875
I'm gonna take these,

26:20.910 --> 26:22.808
you get yourself
whatever you want, okay?

26:22.846 --> 26:24.547
Twenty bucks.
Awesome. Anything?

26:24.576 --> 26:25.815
You got it.
Anything you want.

26:25.846 --> 26:28.615
That's an advance
on the paper route, okay?

26:28.651 --> 26:31.817
-Be careful.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.807

What is this place?

34:05.843 --> 34:10.842
[Pat ] It's the headquarters of
the Justice Society of America.

34:35.170 --> 34:38.440
What is all of this?

34:38.474 --> 34:41.911
Each of the JSA members
had abilities

34:41.943 --> 34:44.614
powers, tools,
like your Cosmic Staff,

34:44.648 --> 34:49.648
and they used them
to protect the world
against people like Icicle.

34:51.119 --> 34:54.123
Who's that?

34:54.157 --> 34:56.025
[Pat] Wildcat.

34:56.059 --> 34:58.860
His real name was Ted Grant.

34:58.893 --> 35:02.231
He was a
heavyweight champion.

35:02.264 --> 35:05.201
He gave me
my Big Boy keychain.

35:05.201 --> 35:06.436
It's the closest thing
he could find

35:06.436 --> 35:11.007
to a Stripesy action figure.

Is this thing real?

35:35.864 --> 35:38.268
Yeah.

It's Dr. Mid-Nite's owl.

35:39.969 --> 35:41.335

35:41.371 --> 35:43.139
There's something
special about him.
I don't know what,

35:43.172 --> 35:44.942
but every time
we'd come here,

35:44.974 --> 35:50.074
that owl, he'd fly
right to Dr. Mid-Nite
and land on his arm.

35:53.081 --> 35:55.016
He doesn't know
Dr. Mid-Nite's dead.

coming back, Court.

None of them are.

36:13.536 --> 36:15.637

the Injustice Society

The truth is,

36:25.248 --> 36:30.000
you and I don't stand a chance
against them.

36:32.088 --> 36:35.088

36:38.161 --> 36:39.262
I'm the new Starman,

36:39.295 --> 36:41.963
so why couldn't there be
a new Hourman,

36:41.998 --> 36:44.833
or a new Dr. Mid-Nite?

36:44.833 --> 36:45.635
[owl hooting]

36:45.635 --> 36:48.405
No. No one can
take their place.

36:48.405 --> 36:50.039
That's what you said
about Starman,

36:50.072 --> 36:53.076
but then the staff
picked me.

36:53.108 --> 36:55.512
Court, these guys,

36:55.545 --> 36:59.114
I mean, they were
the best in the world.

36:59.148 --> 37:02.585
[Courtney] Did they
start out like that?

37:02.619 --> 37:05.621
No. But still with
years of experience

37:05.655 --> 37:08.724
they couldn't defeat
the Injustice Society,

37:08.724 --> 37:10.059
do you understand that?

37:10.092 --> 37:12.929
This stuff
shouldn't be sitting here,

37:12.960 --> 37:14.597

It should be in the hands
of possible heroes.

Don't touch
the Thunderbolt!

37:19.268 --> 37:23.172
That's the most
dangerous thing in here.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.909
Hey, will you just
listen to me for once?

37:26.943 --> 37:32.315
Everything in this room
is dangerous, all right?

37:32.315 --> 37:34.264
This life is.

37:39.889 --> 37:41.757
A kid died today.

37:41.791 --> 37:46.563
A child.

37:46.596 --> 37:50.233
That's why
we can't go on.

37:50.266 --> 37:52.434
A kid died today

37:52.434 --> 37:57.434
and that's exactly why
we have to, Pat.

38:10.420 --> 38:14.170
This is our destiny, Pat.

38:25.702 --> 38:30.702
You know, that's exactly
what Starman said to me
the night he died.

38:36.512 --> 38:38.981
Come on, we're leaving,

38:39.014 --> 38:42.251
