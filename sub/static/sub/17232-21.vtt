00:01.330 --> 00:03.098
Previously on Nashville...

00:03.099 --> 00:04.520
Give me the SD card.

00:07.578 --> 00:10.010
- I'm sorry.
- I'm trying to fix this and I can't.

00:10.026 --> 00:12.599
- What do you mean?
- I can't be around this.

00:12.654 --> 00:15.407
How many times did I have to
drag you out of hotel rooms,

00:15.430 --> 00:18.402
'cause you were so wasted I
didn't know if you were dead?

00:18.425 --> 00:21.608
I found this paternity test,
and I don't think that my dad,

00:21.655 --> 00:23.047
is my father.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.003
No. No, no, no no.

00:26.123 --> 00:27.860
Mama?

00:27.907 --> 00:30.488
No!

00:35.590 --> 00:38.092
We're still going through
your mother's apartment.

00:38.126 --> 00:41.228
Hopefully we'll find something
that can shed some light.

00:41.263 --> 00:44.432
But there was evidence of
oxy usage in the apartment.

00:44.483 --> 00:47.952
We also found a couple of
vials of cocaine on Mr. Rivas.

00:47.986 --> 00:52.156
Guess he turned out to be a...
pretty lousy sober companion.

00:52.190 --> 00:54.408
Yes, he did.

00:54.443 --> 00:56.994
Could be a drug deal gone bad,

00:57.029 --> 01:00.664
but more likely a... a lovers' quarrel.

01:00.699 --> 01:04.952
Were you aware of a romantic relationship?

01:05.037 --> 01:07.321
No, but... (Scoffs)

01:07.355 --> 01:10.341
I wouldn't put it past 'em.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.076
Well, the autopsy's complete,

01:12.094 --> 01:15.262
so the body will be released
to the funeral home today.

01:16.765 --> 01:18.933
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:25.807 --> 01:27.975
(Woman) Juliette!

01:28.026 --> 01:29.927
- (Man) Juliette, will you still be going to the C.M.As?
- (Reporters shouting indistinctly)

01:29.945 --> 01:31.278
<i>(Woman on TV) Singer Juliette Barnes</i>

01:31.313 --> 01:33.564
<i>offered no comment as she
left the police station,</i>

01:33.615 --> 01:36.700
<i>but was clearly distraught
by what's being characterized</i>

01:36.735 --> 01:39.203
<i>as a drug-fueled
murder-suicide.</i>

01:39.237 --> 01:41.005
- That's enough of that.
- (Tv turns off, remote control clatters)

01:41.039 --> 01:43.607
(Sighs deeply) This is awful.

01:43.642 --> 01:45.843
I feel so sorry for Juliette.

01:45.877 --> 01:48.362
Yeah. No matter how old you are,

01:48.396 --> 01:50.748
it is a terrible thing to lose your mother.

01:50.782 --> 01:52.416
Or your father.

01:52.451 --> 01:54.535
Well, y'all aren't losing
either one of us anytime soon.

01:54.586 --> 01:56.720
So I guess she's not
going to the C.M.A. Awards.

01:56.754 --> 02:00.174
No, I wouldn't think so.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.176
That's actually something I
wanted to talk to y'all about.

02:02.210 --> 02:03.511
Um... (Spoon clatters)

02:03.545 --> 02:07.131
so your Uncle Deacon has
asked me to go with him...

02:07.165 --> 02:08.632
as his date.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.986
So I wanted to tell you that
we are seeing each other.

02:12.020 --> 02:13.721
So is he your boyfriend now?

02:13.772 --> 02:14.889
Duh.

02:14.923 --> 02:17.725
Well, we care about each other a lot, so...

02:18.668 --> 02:19.727
yeah, I guess.

02:21.047 --> 02:22.355
I wanna know how you feel about that.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.769
I do like Deacon.

02:26.963 --> 02:27.678
I like him.

02:27.678 --> 02:30.249
Okay, 'cause, you know, if
we go to the C.M.As together,

02:30.287 --> 02:31.988
they're gonna take all
kinds of pictures of us,

02:32.108 --> 02:33.941
and your father and I are public figures,

02:33.978 --> 02:36.387
and you know people are very
interested in our private lives.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.852
And y'all are the most important
part of my private life, so...

02:38.972 --> 02:40.493
You know, they used to date.

02:40.923 --> 02:42.209
When'd you guys date?

02:42.725 --> 02:44.377
Right before she married dad.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.967
Um... all right. So let's get goin'.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.602
Here, grab these.

02:52.416 --> 02:53.656
Thank you.

03:01.437 --> 03:02.551
Jack?

03:03.915 --> 03:05.498
Hey, man.

03:06.559 --> 03:08.193
Gunnar. Hey.

03:09.045 --> 03:10.966
(Taps key) Whoa. Little
early, don't you think?

03:10.972 --> 03:12.180
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

03:12.243 --> 03:13.394
What's on your mind, man?

03:13.514 --> 03:14.339
Hey, I just... I just...

03:14.459 --> 03:15.784
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
You gotta... you gotta...

03:16.034 --> 03:18.053
you gotta see what I found last night.

03:18.087 --> 03:19.124
Look at that.

03:19.244 --> 03:21.101
Not exactly my proudest moment.

03:22.540 --> 03:24.549
- Yeah. Definitely a marketable one.
- (Closes laptop)

03:24.669 --> 03:26.113
Um...

03:28.134 --> 03:29.679
(Exhales) That's not me.

03:30.379 --> 03:32.563
"Gun for a mouth," this new song?

03:32.588 --> 03:34.386
They're my brother Jason's lyrics.

03:35.328 --> 03:38.313
It's his life, man. It's... it's his words.

03:38.663 --> 03:40.246
He died a couple months ago.

03:40.366 --> 03:41.961
I found the songs in his journal.

03:42.005 --> 03:44.883
So you stole these? And that's not outlaw?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.446
Come on, man, what are you
worried about? You're fine.

03:46.459 --> 03:49.568
No, man, it's an act.
It's... I can't do it.

03:50.034 --> 03:51.839
Look, my other material, that's what I'm...

03:51.959 --> 03:52.777
that's what I'm passionate about.

03:52.796 --> 03:54.385
That's what feels real to me.

03:54.654 --> 03:57.245
But I'm not interested in
that. I'm interested in this.

03:57.263 --> 03:58.575
Well, my girlfriend's not.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.511
Okay, you're not serious.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.293
<i>What are you talking about? I am serious.</i>

04:02.344 --> 04:04.233
I mean, you're not
serious about your career.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.698
Don't be that guy who's
gonna chuck it all away

04:06.717 --> 04:08.618
over some girl he's not
gonna remember in ten years.

04:08.653 --> 04:10.153
Don't be that guy.

04:12.607 --> 04:15.055
(Indistinct conversations)

04:15.175 --> 04:16.916
Hey, just give me one second?

04:17.398 --> 04:18.074
Okay.

04:18.093 --> 04:19.676
Thanks, darlin'.

04:20.298 --> 04:21.390
Hey.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.099
Hey.

04:23.150 --> 04:25.817
Thanks again for bailing me out last night.

04:25.937 --> 04:27.365
I suppose it was the least I could do

04:27.378 --> 04:28.598
since I asked you to help him.

04:28.785 --> 04:30.212
Well, there's that.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.604
Listen, after we got sprung,

04:34.724 --> 04:36.831
Gunnar spent the night on my couch.

04:37.338 --> 04:39.791
Hightailed it out of
there early in the mornin'.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.952
Y'all should talk, try
to figure things out.

04:43.971 --> 04:44.934
(Whispers) Yeah.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.938
- (Normal voice) Hey.
- (Avery) Hey.

04:47.576 --> 04:49.553
(Exhales) Maybe you don't want to.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.257
Hey there. Will Lexington.

04:52.308 --> 04:53.392
Avery Barkley.

04:55.111 --> 04:56.510
I'll let you get to it.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.233
You really didn't have
to do this, you know.

05:01.821 --> 05:03.830
Well, you didn't have to turn up and, uh,

05:03.830 --> 05:06.014
<i>whisk my preshow nerves away.</i>

05:06.026 --> 05:07.547
I would've brought it back to you myself,

05:07.578 --> 05:10.055
but I thought Gunnar might've
taken it the wrong way.

05:10.061 --> 05:12.151
Nah, he wouldn't. He wasn't there.

05:12.762 --> 05:14.129
You're kiddin'.

05:14.163 --> 05:15.448
No.

05:16.511 --> 05:18.169
Well, he missed a great show.

05:18.657 --> 05:20.519
I mean, you were...

05:20.553 --> 05:22.469
you were truly great.

05:23.581 --> 05:24.970
Thank you.

05:26.191 --> 05:27.392
That actually means a lot coming from you.

05:29.932 --> 05:32.103
Look, Scarlett, you're an artist.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.800
You always have been.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.902
I'm just...

05:37.772 --> 05:39.824
I'm sorry that Gunnar's the
one who brought it out in you,

05:39.843 --> 05:41.063
and not me.

05:41.332 --> 05:42.984
I hope he's treatin' you right.

05:44.017 --> 05:45.487
He's got a few things to work out,

05:45.537 --> 05:47.676
but, uh, I just needed a break.

05:48.146 --> 05:49.635
(Clicks tongue) Oh.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.649
Well, sorry to hear that.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.245
(Laughs) No, you're not.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.310
(Laughs)

05:56.430 --> 05:59.513
So what are you doing? Are you
playing around town or... what?

06:00.690 --> 06:03.667
Yeah. I got a gig tonight, actually.

06:03.673 --> 06:05.162
It's small but, you know...

06:05.337 --> 06:07.070
- Yeah.
- You can come by if you want.

06:07.190 --> 06:08.684
I can leave your name at the door.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.393
- (Whispers) Hey.
- Hey.

06:13.513 --> 06:15.101
How's she doing?

06:15.441 --> 06:17.235
Not real great. (Exhales)

06:17.643 --> 06:18.812
Hey.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.879
Um, Deacon's here to see you.

06:20.897 --> 06:22.077
Really?

06:27.983 --> 06:29.879
Look, I know you and me been having our...

06:29.999 --> 06:31.293
problems, but...

06:32.800 --> 06:34.164
I still care about you.

06:34.157 --> 06:36.785
And you know I cared about your mom.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.063
<i>I tried to tell you,</i>

06:38.324 --> 06:41.615
but you had to drag me
through it again, didn't you?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.618
I knew she would never stay clean.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.363
I'm sorry. You just...

06:46.520 --> 06:48.941
you called, so I wanted to
help her if I could, and...

06:48.941 --> 06:51.807
Why don't you stop trying to
help people who can't be helped?

06:52.326 --> 06:53.478
If there's anything I can do...

06:53.509 --> 06:56.224
Yeah. You can leave so I can get ready.

06:56.831 --> 06:57.982
(Whispers) For what?

06:59.115 --> 07:01.480
I'm gonna win female
vocalist of the year tonight.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.820
Juliette, you don't have to go...

07:03.820 --> 07:04.721
(Slams door)

07:04.764 --> 07:05.440
(Man over intercom) Mr. Mayor,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.024
there's a Dashell Brinks on the phone?

07:07.144 --> 07:08.444
(Beeps)

07:09.264 --> 07:11.002
Dashell Brinks, how the hell are you?

07:11.040 --> 07:12.679
Well, hello, Mr. Mayor. I'm good.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.944
Ah, it's been a hundred years.
What are you up to these days?

07:15.064 --> 07:17.716
Well, I'm with the U.S. Attorney's office.

07:17.754 --> 07:20.250
I wish I could say this was a social call.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.733
Well, what can I help you with?

07:21.764 --> 07:23.672
Well, I need to talk to ya

07:23.792 --> 07:26.513
about a federal audit of
the music city credit union

07:26.525 --> 07:29.334
where you were on the
board, um, and specifically,

07:29.366 --> 07:32.218
a loan for the Cumberland Plaza project.

07:32.338 --> 07:35.728
Is there a time that we
could speak in person?

07:36.479 --> 07:37.780
Um, yeah, yeah, anytime.

07:37.792 --> 07:40.007
Just, uh, set an appointment
with my assistant.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.509
Be great to see you, Dash.

07:41.534 --> 07:43.629
- Well, I look forward to it.

07:49.942 --> 07:51.619
(Chuckles) Hey.

07:51.932 --> 07:53.940
What are you doing here? You okay?

07:53.996 --> 07:56.020
(Voice breaking) I think...

07:57.739 --> 07:58.971
What is it?

07:59.091 --> 08:01.568
I think that you might be my father.

08:03.495 --> 08:04.533
(Whispers) What?

<i>(man over P.A.) Coming up</i>

08:23.784 --> 08:25.411
I don't know where the hell Deacon is.

08:25.531 --> 08:27.251
He was supposed to pick me up.

08:27.251 --> 08:28.621
Deacon's a pro. He'll be here.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.898
Well, he was also supposed to be my date.

08:31.018 --> 08:32.863
You're seriously ready to
go public with this thing?

08:32.881 --> 08:34.827
<i>I was. I guess he's not.</i>

08:35.178 --> 08:36.629
(Door opens)

08:37.092 --> 08:40.058
I got you these 'cause I
know you don't like roses.

08:40.096 --> 08:40.615
(Chuckles) So...

08:40.602 --> 08:42.717
- Gunnar, please don't do that.
- You were right.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.678
I took that whole image thing way too far.

08:46.798 --> 08:50.026
So I spoke to Jack and,
uh, told him the truth.

08:50.146 --> 08:53.641
So can we start over and
forget this all happened?

08:54.805 --> 08:56.613
You can't just walk in here with...

08:57.251 --> 09:00.141
pretty flowers and your hair combed right

09:01.005 --> 09:02.707
and... make it all better like that.

09:03.489 --> 09:04.553
Well...

09:05.592 --> 09:07.143
I'm trying to fix it. (Chuckles)

09:07.263 --> 09:07.906
I know.

09:07.925 --> 09:09.120
W... what more do you want?

09:09.395 --> 09:10.578
I don't know.

09:11.886 --> 09:13.400
I don't know what I want.

09:14.414 --> 09:16.333
I'm not even sure what we had.

09:17.050 --> 09:18.604
I have to go.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.900
Gonna be late.

09:22.013 --> 09:23.427
Uh, where you going?

09:23.547 --> 09:26.005
See an old friend play at 7th & Fogg.

09:26.925 --> 09:28.333
I'll see you later.

09:28.965 --> 09:30.961

(Indistinct conversations)

09:39.933 --> 09:41.059
(Sighs)

09:42.167 --> 09:43.987
I heard you came in the back way.

09:44.031 --> 09:45.670
How you holding up?

09:46.684 --> 09:47.691
I'm fine.

09:48.173 --> 09:49.374
You sure?

09:50.582 --> 09:52.408
Did I sound unsure?

09:54.104 --> 09:55.693
What are you doing here?

09:56.281 --> 09:59.003
(Scoffs) Juliette, come on.

10:00.773 --> 10:02.449
You shouldn't do this.

10:03.650 --> 10:05.483
Would y'all get out of my dressing room?

10:05.496 --> 10:06.403
I'm trying to get ready.

10:06.415 --> 10:08.424
Look, I just don't think you're

10:08.480 --> 10:10.369
in the right head space
for a night like this.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.378
What, are you afraid that
I'm gonna lose it on live TV?!

10:13.434 --> 10:14.392
Huh?!

10:14.512 --> 10:17.176
You afraid I'm gonna have
some sort of meltdown?!

10:17.476 --> 10:19.709
<i>My mother was the drug addict/murderer,</i>

10:19.728 --> 10:20.716
<i>not me!</i>

10:20.779 --> 10:22.399
She has taken enough of my life,

10:22.418 --> 10:23.688
and she is not gonna take this,

10:23.738 --> 10:25.840
not when I have fought
this hard to get here!

10:26.078 --> 10:28.619
I know exactly how hard you've fought.

10:29.513 --> 10:31.559
I know all the stuff
you had to fight against.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.131
Don't jeopardize it all
now by going out there.

10:34.143 --> 10:35.757
You need to take the time to grieve.

10:35.751 --> 10:37.734
Grieve? What are you talking about?

10:37.965 --> 10:41.606
<i>I should be celebrating
that's it finally over!</i>

10:46.918 --> 10:49.108

10:49.158 --> 10:50.747

10:54.247 --> 10:55.297

10:56.623 --> 10:58.456
I didn't mean that.

11:00.246 --> 11:01.779
I didn't mean that.

11:01.971 --> 11:04.213
Juliette, can I take you home?

11:05.564 --> 11:06.609
No.

11:09.729 --> 11:11.007

11:55.992 --> 11:58.363
Gonna be the next big

11:59.010 --> 12:00.410
You're damn right I am.

All right.

12:02.396 --> 12:04.319
Oh, anyway, this is, uh...

12:04.348 --> 12:05.345

- Hi.

12:06.679 --> 12:07.961
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.687
Gunnar's having a little
fight with his girlfriend,

12:09.700 --> 12:11.458
so he's bunking with me.

12:12.083 --> 12:15.218
Might be a while, though.
I saw her out with her ex.

12:15.338 --> 12:16.237
Out with Avery?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.111
At Garden Cafe, having a meal.

12:18.734 --> 12:21.593
<i>Which I owe this young lady.</i>

12:21.781 --> 12:23.564
So... you make yourself at home.

12:23.589 --> 12:24.846
Yeah. I... I will. (Chuckles) Yeah.

12:24.909 --> 12:26.773
- We're gonna grab some grub.
- Yeah.

12:26.893 --> 12:28.863
- See you in a bit.
- Pleased to meet ya.

12:29.907 --> 12:30.952

12:35.142 --> 12:37.330
Now how I am supposed to
sing with you wearing that?

12:37.362 --> 12:39.858
Ah! (Laughs) You'll manage. You ready?

12:39.864 --> 12:41.579
I think so. Band's not. Where's Deacon?

12:41.642 --> 12:42.981
Right here.

12:43.444 --> 12:45.564
You know, we're the ones

Hey.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.100
Hey.

12:50.357 --> 12:52.077
I thought you were picking me up.

12:52.197 --> 12:53.222
I got waylaid.

12:53.235 --> 12:54.899
(Man) Mr. Claybourne? Right this way.

12:54.968 --> 12:57.314
(Indistinct conversations)

12:57.690 --> 12:59.260

Maddie came to see me.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.528
What?

15:09.977 --> 15:11.545
She wants to know if I'm her father.

15:11.987 --> 15:14.771
She found this, uh,
report, and it said that

15:14.833 --> 15:16.172
Teddy wasn't. So,

15:17.799 --> 15:19.603
I need you to tell me that...

15:20.464 --> 15:21.665
it's not true.

15:22.610 --> 15:24.889
Tell me that you haven't been lying to me

15:25.701 --> 15:29.030
every moment of the last 13 years.

15:31.351 --> 15:32.814
(Inhales deeply)

15:32.934 --> 15:34.505
(Exhales deeply)

15:36.325 --> 15:38.403
How is it possible, huh? Can...

15:39.050 --> 15:40.530
you wanna start by telling me that?

15:40.535 --> 15:43.509
I'd say that the fact
that you can't remember...

15:44.135 --> 15:46.125
<i>is exactly how it's possible.</i>

15:46.137 --> 15:46.894
What does that have to do

15:46.925 --> 15:48.784
with you not telling me that she was mine?

15:48.802 --> 15:50.073
Try to remember

15:50.193 --> 15:52.651
- how you were at that time.
- I remember. I remember, Rayna.

15:52.771 --> 15:54.446
- I got sober.
- I know.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.604
<i>You did get sober.</i>

15:55.604 --> 15:57.468
But it took you five times
in rehab, and you... you...

15:57.481 --> 15:58.294
(Whispers) No.

15:58.344 --> 16:01.103
You know, you broke every stick
of furniture in my apartment.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.843
You're not answering
my question here, okay?

16:02.855 --> 16:04.131
I am answering your question.

16:04.144 --> 16:04.576
(Clears throat)

16:04.607 --> 16:06.202
I found out I was pregnant.

16:06.322 --> 16:07.848
(Voice breaking) I ended up
talking about it with Teddy,

16:07.855 --> 16:09.025
and we... we decided

16:09.237 --> 16:10.401
that we were gonna get married

16:10.470 --> 16:12.991
and we would do a paternity
test after we were married.

16:13.041 --> 16:15.913
And then Coleman said
that I should cut you loose

16:15.913 --> 16:17.977
because we wanted you to get better.

16:18.097 --> 16:19.460
(Sighs deeply) And he thought that would...

16:19.742 --> 16:21.174
be the way to do that.

16:21.231 --> 16:24.027
So then Teddy and I... we made a decision

16:24.147 --> 16:25.216
to do what was best for Maddie...

16:25.260 --> 16:26.755
(Whispers) She's mine?

16:28.432 --> 16:29.571
(Whispers) Yeah.

16:31.854 --> 16:33.212
Deacon?

16:33.332 --> 16:34.695
Deacon!

16:35.283 --> 16:36.622

16:53.627 --> 16:55.335
- Hey.
- Hey, Rayna.

16:55.372 --> 16:57.299
Listen, I need you to come
over to the house, please.

16:57.319 --> 16:58.739
I thought you were still at the C.M.As.

16:58.751 --> 16:59.433
Maddie knows.

16:59.427 --> 17:00.722
<i>She what?</i>

17:01.148 --> 17:01.948
How?

17:01.992 --> 17:03.469
I don't know how she found out,

17:03.531 --> 17:05.027
but she did.

17:05.095 --> 17:06.362
Y... you gotta be kidding me.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.530
Right now I need you
to be my partner in this

17:08.517 --> 17:10.970
because we're gonna have
to get her through it, okay?

17:11.038 --> 17:13.290
- Yes, I will meet you there.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.719
So I'm gonna start the
night off with a song

20:39.314 --> 20:41.561
Because, honey, we didn't know
that was the case at first.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.488
And... and I loved your mother very much

20:43.525 --> 20:44.889
and decided that it didn't matter.

20:45.102 --> 20:47.399
It doesn't matter who my real father is?

20:47.442 --> 20:49.464
- No, honey, that's not what I'm say...
- It's so hard to understand,

20:49.464 --> 20:51.996
- and it was such a complicated situation.
- No, I understand it all.

20:52.116 --> 20:54.386
<i>You lied to Deacon and to me.</i>

20:54.430 --> 20:56.395
Daddy, I wanna live with you.

20:56.515 --> 20:58.039
- Okay, honey. No, come on, please.
- Maddie...

20:58.058 --> 21:00.830
No, this is all your
mistake... my even being born.

21:00.836 --> 21:01.850
(Zips bag) So... (Sobbing)

21:01.887 --> 21:04.058
- Honey, no...
- That's not true, honey.

21:04.239 --> 21:05.147
- Rayna, hold...
- Maddie.

21:05.184 --> 21:06.122
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Now listen...

21:06.147 --> 21:07.355
- What do... what?!
- Just listen.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.207
Just... look, if she needs
to work through it this way,

21:09.201 --> 21:09.921
then let her do it.

21:09.933 --> 21:11.591
You promised me that I wouldn't lose her.

21:11.616 --> 21:13.625
I'm promising you the same thing.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.161
<i>I've been saying for years,</i>

21:18.192 --> 21:19.469
<i>if you wanna make this interesting,</i>

21:19.589 --> 21:21.959
<i>let's not vote for 'em.
Let's let 'em wrestle.</i>

21:22.441 --> 21:24.824
<i>And the nominees for
female vocalist of the year</i>

21:24.868 --> 21:26.394
<i>are Rayna James... </i>

21:26.745 --> 21:29.060
<i>(Cheers and applause)</i>

21:29.516 --> 21:30.642
Can you please turn that off?

21:31.462 --> 21:33.946
<i>- Juliette Barnes...
- Not a country music fan?</i>

21:34.885 --> 21:36.280
Not tonight.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.744
<i>(Jerry Lee Lewis) * with my tears *</i>

21:37.755 --> 21:42.600
<i>* it goes tumbling to the floor *</i>

21:44.412 --> 21:46.379
(Sets down glass)

21:46.414 --> 21:48.232
<i>* Once again *</i>

21:49.752 --> 21:53.212
<i>* the whole town will be talkin' *</i>

21:53.249 --> 21:55.139
<i>- * yes, they will  *
- (Ice cubes rattle)</i>

21:55.189 --> 21:57.128
(Sets down glass)

21:57.308 --> 21:59.643
<i>* Lord, I've seen *</i>

22:00.444 --> 22:04.367
<i>* the pity that's in their eyes *</i>

22:05.043 --> 22:06.676
(Sighs)

22:07.257 --> 22:10.718
<i>* They can never understand *</i>

22:10.838 --> 22:11.688
You know what?

22:12.489 --> 22:13.871
What?

22:13.908 --> 22:16.080
I'd like another.

22:24.790 --> 22:26.654
In order to keep the company afloat

22:26.666 --> 22:28.468
and my investors from losing their shirts,

22:28.518 --> 22:29.776
Peggy helped me borrow some money.

22:29.795 --> 22:30.752
In other words,

22:30.790 --> 22:33.612
you embezzled money from
a credit union together.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.332
Look, there's no reason to hold back,

22:35.532 --> 22:37.259
not from your lawyer, anyway.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.881
So how much money are we talking about?

22:39.931 --> 22:41.439
- $2 million.
- (Sighs)

22:41.482 --> 22:43.872
Which I paid back in full years ago.

22:44.742 --> 22:47.019
But after my mayoral campaign began,

22:47.032 --> 22:48.314
they started an audit.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.103
It got handled, or so I thought.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.148
By whom?

22:51.268 --> 22:53.018
Lamar Wyatt.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.102
I assume he bribed the auditor.

22:55.164 --> 22:58.005
Well, we might be able
to cut a deal for you

22:58.024 --> 22:59.281
if we can tie him to it.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.582
Well, I'm pretty sure he was the one

23:00.614 --> 23:02.366
who tipped off the feds in the first place,

23:02.486 --> 23:05.412
which he wouldn't do unless
he knew he was untouchable.

23:06.908 --> 23:09.015
I know, Walter. I...

23:09.355 --> 23:10.317
I screwed up.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.244
I mean, worst-case scenario, what is it?

23:12.364 --> 23:13.940
Well, they find the smoking gun.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.111
They indict. We go to trial.

23:16.231 --> 23:19.082
We lose, and you go to federal prison.

23:19.145 --> 23:21.983
But they have to find
that smoking gun first.

23:22.018 --> 23:24.050
My guess is that they'll try and do that

23:24.068 --> 23:25.439
through Peggy Kenter.

23:25.921 --> 23:27.188
(Sighs)

23:29.955 --> 23:31.682
(Voice breaking) He's not
returning my phone calls.

23:31.688 --> 23:33.133
He's not picking up his phone.

23:33.183 --> 23:35.998
I don't know where he is,
and I have a bad feeling.

23:36.118 --> 23:37.850
I think he's in trouble,

23:38.082 --> 23:40.090
and if he goes into this cycle again,

23:40.109 --> 23:43.512
it will destroy him. It will destroy us.

23:43.531 --> 23:45.296
Don't worry. Look, I would've hoped

23:45.321 --> 23:47.358
that he would have called
me first. I don't know.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.295
You gotta help me find him, Cole.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.939
Just understand, Rayna,
that if he's been drinking,

23:51.946 --> 23:53.835
it's best that I go out there
and I find him on my own.

23:53.835 --> 23:55.599
Please trust me on this.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.076
I do.

24:01.293 --> 24:02.092
Hey.

24:02.638 --> 24:05.512
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

24:15.126 --> 24:16.539
You won.

24:26.351 --> 24:27.440
(Award clatters)

24:30.003 --> 24:31.087
Anything else?

24:32.901 --> 24:34.015
Yeah.

24:48.717 --> 24:51.939
It's me again, just got to this funeral,

24:52.715 --> 24:55.411
and... I'm really, really
hoping I'm gonna see you here.

24:56.631 --> 24:58.640
Deacon, please call me.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.274
Please, I'm begging you. I...

25:02.343 --> 25:05.709
(Sighs deeply) I love you, babe.
I just... I need to talk to you.

25:07.223 --> 25:08.788
I hope I'm gonna see you.

25:11.922 --> 25:14.143
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh!

25:14.969 --> 25:16.020
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:16.057 --> 25:16.814
You stole my life!

25:16.864 --> 25:18.772
What are you talking about?
No one stole anything from you!

25:18.772 --> 25:20.074
You stole my... my daughter!

25:20.092 --> 25:21.857
You weren't capable of being a father!

25:21.882 --> 25:23.502
You know what? You never were!

25:23.521 --> 25:24.504
You haven't changed...

25:24.497 --> 25:27.119
- You have no right! You don't know me!
- Oh, I know you!

25:27.150 --> 25:29.783
- Look at you. You're a loser! You're belligerent!
- (Shouts indistinctly)

25:30.071 --> 25:31.454
- You're drunk!
- She's mine!

25:31.504 --> 25:33.632
- Maddie deserved better, and so did Rayna!
- (Grunting)

25:33.951 --> 25:36.260
Rayna deserved a thousand
times better than you!

25:36.272 --> 25:37.561
You had no right!

25:37.824 --> 25:39.682
You stay away from my family. You hear me?

25:39.802 --> 25:41.628
Let him go. Get him outta here.

25:43.092 --> 25:45.656
(Panting)

25:45.675 --> 25:46.870
(Man) Take it easy.

25:46.990 --> 25:47.852
Come on. Get up.

25:47.834 --> 25:49.348
Get off of me!

25:54.278 --> 25:56.236
I lost my mom, too, you know.

25:56.749 --> 25:58.902
Different circumstances, you know?

25:58.927 --> 26:01.292
But I have some idea how it feels.

26:03.037 --> 26:05.065
Yeah, you don't know what it was like

26:05.083 --> 26:06.967
to grow up with a mom like that.

26:07.392 --> 26:09.688
I grew up in the dirt.

26:10.883 --> 26:12.760
(Whispers) Everything was filthy.

26:15.319 --> 26:17.665
And now I get to put her back in the dirt.

26:18.723 --> 26:20.130
I just lived my life

26:20.143 --> 26:21.794
knowing that this day

26:22.670 --> 26:24.278
was gonna come.

26:25.730 --> 26:26.902
Dreading it.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.172
Wanting it.

26:30.206 --> 26:32.591
Hating myself for wanting it.

26:34.651 --> 26:36.678
I guess I just always

26:37.279 --> 26:39.851
thought that if I was good enough...

26:40.483 --> 26:42.584
that she would be all right.

26:42.923 --> 26:44.901
And I tried to be good.

26:45.519 --> 26:47.715
But I was always gonna fail.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.493
I was never gonna be good enough.

26:52.639 --> 26:53.959
That's not true.

26:54.216 --> 26:55.780
You're good enough.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.673
(Sighs)

27:05.922 --> 27:08.825
Do you, uh, do you know if Deacon's coming?

27:11.530 --> 27:12.761
I don't.

27:15.351 --> 27:17.459
(Retching and coughing)

27:18.573 --> 27:20.287
- Deacon?
- (Vomiting)

27:20.287 --> 27:21.545
Hey, man. Hey, you all right?

27:21.570 --> 27:23.022
Yeah, I'm good.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.498
- Yeah? You sure?
- I'm fine. Yeah.

27:24.533 --> 27:25.762
My, uh...

27:26.131 --> 27:27.977
my key, uh...

27:29.003 --> 27:32.388
doesn't work in my door.
(Coughs) It won't open.

27:33.408 --> 27:36.774
Oh. (Chuckles) Thank you.
Thank you. It was stuck.

27:37.169 --> 27:39.030
- You've been drinking?
- (Bottles clink)

27:41.200 --> 27:42.262
What do you want?

27:43.452 --> 27:44.902
- Uh, I...
- Why are you here?

27:44.937 --> 27:48.224
I just needed some advice on
Scarlett, that's all. Uh...

27:48.257 --> 27:49.623
I don't have advice.

27:49.641 --> 27:52.059
Look, you... you need a hand getting...

27:52.353 --> 27:53.247
in?

27:53.585 --> 27:54.728
(Sighs)

27:58.050 --> 28:00.624
Hey, yeah, it's me. Uh, I think
you need to get your uncle's

28:00.643 --> 28:02.313
sncnsor to his house right away.

28:02.433 --> 28:04.015
(Minister) Lord, our God,

28:04.384 --> 28:05.936
you are always faithful

28:06.467 --> 28:09.314
and quick to show us mercy,
but our hearts are broken.

28:10.308 --> 28:12.711
Jolene was taken from us so suddenly.

28:13.255 --> 28:15.283
So come swiftly to her aid.

28:15.677 --> 28:17.084
Have mercy on her,

28:17.854 --> 28:19.813
and comfort her family and her friends

28:19.838 --> 28:21.987
by the power of the cross.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.718
We ask this through Christ our lord.

28:25.225 --> 28:27.865
We commend to almighty God, Jolene.

28:27.985 --> 28:31.538
Earth to earth, ashes to
ashes, and dust to dust.

28:31.563 --> 28:33.358
May the lord bless her and keep her.

28:33.534 --> 28:35.923
May the lord make his
face to shine upon her.

28:36.043 --> 28:38.036
May the lord be gracious to her

28:38.050 --> 28:39.471
and give her peace.

28:39.896 --> 28:41.085
Amen.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.941
Hey.

28:52.178 --> 28:52.901
Mm.

28:54.805 --> 28:55.568
Hey.

28:55.688 --> 28:56.864
I'm so sorry.

29:00.761 --> 29:02.751
I... I didn't know that this was private.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.034
I'm glad you came.

29:05.185 --> 29:08.201
I actually have a favor to ask.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.460
Anything.

29:12.174 --> 29:14.270
I just came by to talk
to him about somethin',

29:14.263 --> 29:15.121
and, uh, he was wasted.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.835
- I tried to get in, but...
- Deacon?

29:17.586 --> 29:20.277
Deacon, open up! It's Cole.

29:20.397 --> 29:22.447
(Deacon) Go away!

29:22.491 --> 29:23.405
(Loud clatter)

29:23.436 --> 29:25.369
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:25.489 --> 29:26.658
What the hell are you doing?

29:26.696 --> 29:28.154
- Get out of my house.
- What are you doing?

29:28.198 --> 29:29.912
I don't want you in my house!

29:29.887 --> 29:31.640
Deacon, what happened?

29:31.665 --> 29:32.866
- Just... just tell me what happened.
- You brought her here?

29:32.879 --> 29:34.180
Why would you bring her here?

29:34.199 --> 29:35.457
He didn't know what to do.
He's trying to help you.

29:35.457 --> 29:36.471
You want some advice.
I'll give you some advice.

29:36.514 --> 29:38.735
- Get away from her. You're not good enough.
- (Coleman) Deacon, Deacon.

29:38.742 --> 29:40.788
- He's broken. Inside, he's... inside, he's...
- Deacon, listen to me.

29:40.806 --> 29:41.945
Deacon, look, listen to
me. Deacon, stop it, please.

29:41.964 --> 29:42.971
I'm not gonna listen to you anymore!

29:42.984 --> 29:45.680
I'm not listening to you
or your A.A. crap anymore!

29:45.724 --> 29:46.812
- Get out of my house!
- Deacon...

29:46.850 --> 29:48.014
- Stop.
- Get out of my house!

29:48.070 --> 29:49.403
- Deacon, I'm not going anywhere.
- Get out of my house!

29:49.409 --> 29:51.536
- (Scarlett) Deacon, stop it.
- No.

29:51.893 --> 29:53.219
Fine. I'll go.

29:53.339 --> 29:54.815
Deacon, get back here.

29:54.846 --> 29:56.736
Deacon, stop it!

29:56.804 --> 29:58.406
(Grunting)

29:58.443 --> 30:00.752
- (Scarlett) It's okay. It's okay. Come on. It's okay.
- (Deacon speaks indistinctly)

30:01.127 --> 30:03.198
(Crying) Come on.

30:03.922 --> 30:05.000
(Deacon growls) Aah!

30:05.120 --> 30:07.022
- No, Deacon! No! No, Deacon, stop!
- You're gonna hurt him!

30:07.016 --> 30:09.631
- Cut me loose!
- No, buddy.

30:14.686 --> 30:17.996
- (Gunnar) Deacon! Deacon! Get off him! Deacon!
- (Deacon grunting)

30:18.116 --> 30:20.649
Okay, Deacon, now look.
Look at what you're doing.

30:20.712 --> 30:22.189
Look at her.

30:22.401 --> 30:23.659
(Panting) (Sniffles)

30:23.684 --> 30:24.672
- Go ahead. Take her home.
- I'm sorry.

30:24.691 --> 30:26.180
- You sure?
- Get her out.

30:26.462 --> 30:27.581
- Come on.
- (Crying) No, I don't wanna go.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.665
- I don't wanna leave him.
- He's all right. He's all right.

30:29.709 --> 30:31.367
I'm sorry.

30:31.573 --> 30:34.156
- You take care of him, please.
- (Crying) Come on.

30:34.219 --> 30:36.777
(Sobbing) Come on.

30:37.109 --> 30:39.761
(Continues sobbing)

30:40.571 --> 30:43.490
(Panting)

30:47.408 --> 30:48.922
I don't wanna talk.

30:49.042 --> 30:50.617
I don't wanna talk either.

30:51.731 --> 30:54.290
(Panting) But I'm not leaving here, Deacon.

30:58.151 --> 30:59.306
What's all this?

31:01.973 --> 31:04.845
Albert thinks the baseball stadium

31:04.864 --> 31:06.097
is still viable.

31:06.954 --> 31:08.065
Since when?

31:08.781 --> 31:11.485
He suggested we put a
shopping mall in that site.

31:11.519 --> 31:13.517
I was only talking about alternatives.

31:13.637 --> 31:15.419
- Oh.
- By the way,

31:15.469 --> 31:17.308
I'm moving Albert up in the organization,

31:17.302 --> 31:20.518
given that his vision is
more in line with mine.

31:20.950 --> 31:22.270
You're demoting me?

31:22.470 --> 31:25.849
No, I'm just promoting him above you.

31:26.531 --> 31:27.667
Don't bother.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.261
I quit.

31:31.381 --> 31:32.599
(Lamar scoffs)

31:32.940 --> 31:35.033
Come on, Tandy. What...
what are you talking about?

31:35.153 --> 31:36.885
Oh, it's none of your business.

31:37.342 --> 31:39.175
I'm just your daughter now,

31:39.419 --> 31:41.847
and apparently you can
only stay on good terms

31:41.884 --> 31:43.911
with one of them at a time.

31:47.728 --> 31:51.150
Let me guess. You found out
more nasty details about my mom.

31:51.206 --> 31:52.676
To be honest, no.

31:53.089 --> 31:55.980
But the crime scene techs
found a camera's SD card

31:56.011 --> 31:57.663
in the garbage disposal at her place.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.171
Can't pull any data off the card,

31:59.202 --> 32:02.367
but it seems like a pretty deliberate act.

32:02.411 --> 32:04.420
Any idea what might have been on it?

32:06.202 --> 32:07.322
No.

32:08.198 --> 32:09.900
Well, it's yours if you want it.

32:10.613 --> 32:12.622
We're done processing the crime scene,

32:12.628 --> 32:14.160
so you can take back the apartment.

32:14.173 --> 32:16.181
I'll call if anything else comes up.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.626
- Thank you.
- (Emily) Oh, my God.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.379
You got a letter...

32:20.480 --> 32:22.050
from your mom.

32:30.020 --> 32:32.116
(Papers rustle)

32:35.520 --> 32:36.790
(Gasps)

32:37.028 --> 32:39.155
She was protecting me.

32:39.275 --> 32:40.606
What?

32:43.115 --> 32:45.487
(Voice breaking) "I'm so sorry, baby.

32:46.650 --> 32:49.190
Let me take all the blame,

32:49.391 --> 32:52.782
all the scandal, all the
ugliness away from you."

32:54.396 --> 32:56.710
"You deserve to be clean.

32:58.149 --> 33:00.208
You deserve to be free."

33:05.832 --> 33:07.584
She did it on purpose...

33:08.754 --> 33:10.362
(Whispers) to save me.

33:12.164 --> 33:15.192
Rayna, it's Cole. He's here. He's out.

33:15.442 --> 33:16.869
No, I'm gonna stick around.

33:16.989 --> 33:19.453
And I'll be here when
he, uh, when he comes to.

33:19.653 --> 33:22.050
No, no, no, no, no. You stay right there.

33:22.318 --> 33:23.814
Yeah, it's, uh...

33:24.771 --> 33:26.255
it's bad.

33:26.892 --> 33:28.394
All right, we'll talk later.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.592
(Inhales sharply)

33:33.780 --> 33:35.158
(Groans)

33:35.377 --> 33:36.732
Morning, sunshine.

33:41.133 --> 33:42.097
Is it?

33:42.217 --> 33:43.255
What?

33:44.030 --> 33:45.006
Morning.

33:45.394 --> 33:46.414
Nope.

33:48.065 --> 33:49.955
(Groans) Oh, God.

33:50.075 --> 33:52.189
Well, that's a good first call.

33:53.347 --> 33:55.530
- You might need him.
- (Exhales) Oh, my God.

33:55.955 --> 33:58.126
There's a whole lot of people
worried about you, buddy.

33:58.359 --> 33:59.771
(Exhales)

34:01.330 --> 34:02.638
Look, I talked to Rayna.

34:02.995 --> 34:04.390
She told me what happened.

34:08.875 --> 34:10.943
I'm not ready to talk about that yet.

34:10.976 --> 34:12.786
I understand.

34:14.157 --> 34:16.281
I would like to go to a meeting.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.516
Yeah?

34:19.886 --> 34:21.464
(Whispers) Yeah.

34:27.813 --> 34:30.931
Just gonna grab a quick
shower, get some coffee.

34:31.051 --> 34:32.295
No, I'll take care of that.

34:32.476 --> 34:33.632
Well, you can get the coffee,

34:33.666 --> 34:35.110
but you don't gotta babysit me anymore.

34:35.579 --> 34:36.755
You sure about that?

34:36.812 --> 34:38.976
Look, I get what I've done here, Cole.

34:39.552 --> 34:40.578
Believe me.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.518
13 years of sobriety just...

34:48.335 --> 34:49.731
all I can do is go get my

34:49.975 --> 34:51.908
new welcome chip at the 8:00, right?

34:52.597 --> 34:54.154
You'll be there?

34:54.512 --> 34:56.670
Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.228
Thanks.

34:58.706 --> 35:00.487
I know you're mad.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.677
I am mad.

35:03.622 --> 35:04.710
I know.

35:05.296 --> 35:06.644
(Whispers) I'm sorry.

35:08.921 --> 35:11.061
(Normal voice) But I don't want
you to be mad at me forever.

35:11.686 --> 35:13.363
'Cause we need each other.

35:14.427 --> 35:16.147
I married your dad

35:16.604 --> 35:18.181
'cause I loved him.

35:19.638 --> 35:21.334
But I also married him

35:21.910 --> 35:23.180
'cause I wanted you

35:23.205 --> 35:25.270
to have a father who loved you

35:25.802 --> 35:26.914
as much as I do.

35:27.034 --> 35:29.374
And I love you more than
anybody in the world.

35:32.308 --> 35:34.074
And I'm never, ever gonna leave you.

35:34.108 --> 35:37.027
(Crying)

35:38.813 --> 35:40.613
(Inhales sharply)

35:40.648 --> 35:43.566
(Continues crying)

35:48.731 --> 35:49.845
(Water drains)

35:50.341 --> 35:52.847
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

35:53.144 --> 35:55.595
(Exhales deeply)

35:55.629 --> 35:57.263
(Pills rattle)

35:57.298 --> 35:58.264
(Cap clicks)

35:58.299 --> 35:59.265
(Sighs)

35:59.299 --> 36:00.500
(Pills rattle)

36:00.534 --> 36:01.868
(Exhales deeply)

36:01.902 --> 36:04.347
(Cell phone rings)

36:04.588 --> 36:06.089
(Ring)

36:07.031 --> 36:08.274
(Sighs)

36:08.394 --> 36:09.635
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

36:09.641 --> 36:10.792
I should have been there

36:10.987 --> 36:12.012
for you. I'm sorry.

36:12.132 --> 36:12.976
No.

36:14.490 --> 36:15.605
It's my fault.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.993
I...

36:17.693 --> 36:19.477
pushed you away, and I shouldn't have.

36:19.512 --> 36:20.628
No.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.574
Anyway, I'm having a little

36:23.762 --> 36:25.850
memorial service at the Bluebird tonight.

36:26.427 --> 36:28.286
It would mean a lot if you came.

36:29.086 --> 36:31.588
Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there.

36:32.239 --> 36:33.842
Thank you.

36:45.554 --> 36:47.398
(Exhales)

37:01.657 --> 37:03.490
Thanks for meeting me.

37:04.060 --> 37:05.549
So I don't know why,

37:05.586 --> 37:07.069
but it's happening again.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.666
U.S. attorney is looking
at the Vumberland deal.

37:09.697 --> 37:11.679
I know. I met with them.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.433
(Sighs)

37:17.069 --> 37:19.088
Did you do it because you're angry with me?

37:19.208 --> 37:20.671
<i>They approached me.</i>

37:20.791 --> 37:22.340
They offered immunity.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.575
Right.

37:25.802 --> 37:28.461
And, uh, what did you tell them?

37:29.887 --> 37:30.865
Nothing.

37:31.733 --> 37:32.884
Nothing?

37:33.898 --> 37:36.287
Why wouldn't you cut a
deal to save yourself?

37:37.389 --> 37:38.766
I'm pregnant.

37:40.142 --> 37:41.275
What?

37:47.964 --> 37:48.989
Tandy Hampton?

37:49.239 --> 37:51.273
Dashell Brinks, U.S. Attorney's office.

37:51.393 --> 37:54.607
We would, uh, very much like
to have a conversation with you

37:54.651 --> 37:55.921
about your father.

37:57.654 --> 37:59.601
(Juliette) I know you all probably know

37:59.601 --> 38:00.752
that, uh,

38:01.390 --> 38:03.392
my mama passed away recently,

38:04.111 --> 38:04.949
and, uh,

38:05.069 --> 38:06.601
she wasn't perfect.

38:06.845 --> 38:08.315
In fact, she was kind of a mess.

38:08.315 --> 38:10.374
But, um, she was my mess.

38:11.068 --> 38:11.938
(Inhales deeply)

38:11.963 --> 38:13.771
And, uh, she was my mom,

38:13.891 --> 38:15.435
and I loved her anyway,

38:15.829 --> 38:17.250
and she loved me.

38:18.182 --> 38:21.642
But her biggest dream was to see me

38:22.380 --> 38:24.332
sing at the Bluebird.

38:24.452 --> 38:27.485
So I hope you're here tonight, mama,

38:28.468 --> 38:30.853
and this one's for you.
