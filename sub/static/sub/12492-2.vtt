00:03.590 --> 00:05.640
Hi, Charlie. It's Teddy here.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.930
So right now you're nine months old

00:07.939 --> 00:09.900
and everything is going great.

00:09.900 --> 00:12.630
Well, almost everything.

00:12.630 --> 00:16.490
Now what I'm about to show you is kind of disturbing,

00:16.490 --> 00:18.820
So brace yourself.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.250
Mmm, these sandwiches will be yummy wummy.

00:24.250 --> 00:28.000
Yes, they will, yes, they will.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.159
Mom and dad have been talking like that ever since you arrived

00:32.159 --> 00:35.910
And if it's not over soon, I'm gonna go crazy wazy.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.110
- PJ! - what?

00:38.110 --> 00:39.500
What are you listening to?

00:39.500 --> 00:42.900
I downloaded a podcast on the history of ballet.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.200
- you like that? - More than baby talk.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.240
Would you like some fishy wishies with your cookie wookie?

00:50.240 --> 00:53.040
Yes, I would, yes, I would.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.750
Wait, guys, Charlie isn't even here.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.770
No, widdle baby take a nappy wappy upstairs.

00:59.770 --> 01:02.720
So why are you guys still talking like that?

01:04.300 --> 01:07.110
I don't "weawy" know.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.760
I guess we're just kinda fried.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.150
Well, we work all day, take care of a baby all night.

01:13.150 --> 01:14.790
Work shift, baby shift

01:14.790 --> 01:16.600
I've barely got time to make doo-doo

01:16.600 --> 01:20.200
Well, when was the last time you guys had a night out?

01:20.200 --> 01:22.960
You know, like just the two of you-- like a date?

01:27.700 --> 01:30.000
Teddy made a funny.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.900
A funny wunny.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.370
Seriously! you know what? it's saturday night.

01:36.370 --> 01:38.570
You two, you go out, have fun,

01:38.570 --> 01:40.140
And do something besides work,

01:40.140 --> 01:42.180
take care of the baby and make doo-doo.

01:42.180 --> 01:45.000
Well, it's nice to dream,

01:45.000 --> 01:46.560
but who's gonna take of Charlie

01:46.560 --> 01:49.720
Hello! you've got three great babysitters right here.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.270
I'm glad I didn't hear that.

01:52.430 --> 01:54.880
I don't know, Teddy. It's a really nice thought,

01:54.880 --> 01:57.930
But we're really not ready to go out without Charlie just yet

01:57.930 --> 02:00.520
- You guys want to see a magic trick? - Sure!

02:00.520 --> 02:03.520
- Okay. - Prepare to be amazed.

02:10.090 --> 02:12.560
I could use a night out.

02:16.330 --> 02:18.200
Day's all burnt toast

02:18.200 --> 02:19.900
Running late,and dad says

02:19.900 --> 02:22.970
Has anybody seen my left shoe

02:22.970 --> 02:24.510
I close my eyes, take a bite

02:24.510 --> 02:26.170
Grab a ride, laugh out loud

02:26.180 --> 02:28.310
There it is up on the roof

02:29.710 --> 02:32.580
I've been there, I've survived

02:32.580 --> 02:35.880
So just take my advice

02:35.890 --> 02:39.470
Hang in there, baby, things are crazy

02:39.470 --> 02:42.310
But I know your future is bright

02:42.310 --> 02:44.190
Hang in there, Baby

02:44.190 --> 02:46.110
There is no maybe

02:46.110 --> 02:48.600
Eveything turns out all right

02:48.600 --> 02:50.950
Sure life is up and down

02:50.950 --> 02:54.870
But trust me, it comes back all around

02:54.870 --> 02:58.660
You're gonna love who you turn out to be

02:59.840 --> 03:02.290
Hang in there, Baby

03:02.440 --> 03:05.050
Good Luck Charlie  S01E02  Baby Come Back

03:07.770 --> 03:11.320
All right, you guys have fun. Stay out as late as you want.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.690
But not too much fun-- We have enough kids already.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.780
I'm serious.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.860
Okay, everyone, be good, have fun, love you.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.200
- Yeah yeah. - All right.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.170
Hey, Teddy, thanks for doing this.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.630
It's gonna be nice for your mom and I

03:28.630 --> 03:30.010
to have some special time together

03:30.010 --> 03:33.410
- Bob, move your butt! - I'm coming!

03:36.260 --> 03:39.100
All right, so we divide it up evenly,

03:39.100 --> 03:41.520
We each get to spend an hour with Charlie.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.990
Who wants to go first?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.750
I think you should go first.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.860
And second and third, since this was your idea.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.860
Hey, I'm not doing this all by myself.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.230
you guys have to help out.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.900
Fine. I'll go fourth.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.460
There is no fourth.

03:55.460 --> 03:59.600
I meant I shall go forth to the park to shoot some hoop.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.020
You want to go to the park so badly,

04:02.020 --> 04:03.370
Then why don't you just take Charlie?

04:03.370 --> 04:05.610
What's a baby supposed to do at the park?

04:05.610 --> 04:08.540
Babies love parks. you can show her the duck pond,

04:08.540 --> 04:10.450
The blue sky, clouds.

04:10.450 --> 04:14.620
We're just gonna look at stuff? that's what TV is for.

04:20.790 --> 04:23.560
Yeah heh hah, all right!

04:23.560 --> 04:26.510
This is great. Whee!

04:26.510 --> 04:29.630
Yes, whoo!

04:31.000 --> 04:34.270
What are you looking at? I was here first.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.860
Hey, you can ride that duck.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.330
I couldn't ride the duck. I'd look silly on the duck.

04:41.860 --> 04:44.110
Fine.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.790
Hey there, Charlie. Are we having fun yet?

04:53.790 --> 04:55.720
All right.

05:00.930 --> 05:05.330
Man, you seen a kid's birthday party around here anywhere?

05:05.330 --> 05:07.040
I'm the entertainment.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.670
I saw a bounce house of the other end of the park.

05:09.670 --> 05:12.270
A bouncy house, eh? Great.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.360
Another trip to the E.R.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.350
Who are you supposed to be anyway?

05:18.350 --> 05:19.820
Plastic man, rubber man?

05:19.820 --> 05:23.370
No, those are all registered trademarks.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.220
I'm Captain Stretchy.

05:26.740 --> 05:30.860
There used to be a "CS" here, but it came off in the wash.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.560
So what's your super power?

05:33.560 --> 05:35.830
Super elasticity.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.570
Hey, look, there's a quarter.

05:42.110 --> 05:43.920
Ah, forget it.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.340
Not like it's a dollar, right?

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:57.220 --> 05:59.590
- Hi. - Hi.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.910
Oh, yeah, I like your taste in strollers.

06:03.910 --> 06:06.030
Thanks, you too.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.620
- That baby's so cute. - You too.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.200
Oh, I mean yours too.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.340
- I'm Emma. - I'm PJ

06:16.340 --> 06:18.840
- Who's this little guy? - My brother.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.130
We're just out for our stroll. We do this every day.

06:21.130 --> 06:25.580
Us too. Like I always say, babies love parks.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.750
- Would you like to sit for a bit? - Sure.

06:29.750 --> 06:34.220
So I saw you talking to Captain Stretchy earlier.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.690
Oh, yeah, he was lost.

06:36.690 --> 06:39.630
- Not much of a superhero, right? - Oh, he's the worst.

06:39.630 --> 06:42.110
We hired him for my brother's birthday party

06:42.110 --> 06:45.070
- and he sat on the cake. - That sounds awful.

06:45.070 --> 06:45.980
Oh, it gets worse.

06:45.980 --> 06:49.290
The candles was lit, so he sat in the punch

06:49.290 --> 06:51.120
That's so weird.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.640
I mean he looks like such a quality entertainer.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.760
You know, PJ, I'm really impressed that

06:58.760 --> 07:00.780
you take your baby sister to the park.

07:00.780 --> 07:02.970
My brothers would never do anything like that.

07:02.970 --> 07:06.250
I hope not. She is my sister.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.310
Now watch closely. In this hand I have a quarter

07:15.310 --> 07:18.230
And in the other, an ordinary egg.

07:18.230 --> 07:23.770
Now I put them in this hat, spin them around a little

07:23.890 --> 07:27.010
And presto.

07:29.030 --> 07:31.080
Just out of curiosity,

07:31.080 --> 07:33.320
What was supposed to happen?

07:34.350 --> 07:36.790
I love this baby.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.760
Anytime she wants to go to the park, sign me up.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.790
What happened to you?

07:42.790 --> 07:46.430
Let's just say charlie made a friend, PJmade a friend.

07:46.430 --> 07:50.160
Oh-- and did either you or your friend bother to change a diper?

07:50.170 --> 07:54.800
There's no time for that. I was too busy talking to Emma.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.270
- Who's emma? - A vision,

07:57.270 --> 08:00.510
An angel, the girl who's moved into my heart.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.580
Did you tell her about the vacancy in your brain?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.380
- PJ? - what?

08:07.380 --> 08:09.200
You brought home the wrong baby.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.850
What? I did not.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.910
Take a look! Wrong parts.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.360
There's nothing wrong with those parts.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.560
How could you bring home the wrong baby?

08:30.560 --> 08:33.390
I'm sorry. I got a little distracted.

08:33.390 --> 08:36.390
Emma is really cute.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.179
Yeah, well, so was our sister.

08:39.179 --> 08:41.030
Come on, let's go to the park and find her.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.929
Relax! I got her number.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.350
Then what are you waiting for? call her.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.560
Wait a second.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.440
Is it too soon?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.760
If I call now, she'll think I'm desperate.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.030
Oh, you are desperate.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.060
Good point.

08:58.570 --> 09:00.400
Hello, is Emma there?

09:01.750 --> 09:04.420
This is a Chinese restaurant?

09:04.420 --> 09:06.460
Sure, I'll hear the specials.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.510
She gave you the wrong number.

09:08.510 --> 09:10.750
Who couldn't see that one coming?

09:12.100 --> 09:16.280
But I gave her gum and helped her change a poopy diaper.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.750
It was so romantic.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.590
Well, what do we do now?

09:26.060 --> 09:27.380
Oh no!

09:27.380 --> 09:29.930
Hi mom, what up?

09:29.930 --> 09:32.800
Yeah, everything's going great. why wouldn't it be?

09:32.800 --> 09:36.400
We're just having a grand old time here with--

09:37.310 --> 09:39.040
Baby

09:39.040 --> 09:41.960
Yeah, sure you can talk to him. her her!

09:41.960 --> 09:44.280
Talk to mommy.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.970
What do you mean that did't sound like Charlie?

09:49.970 --> 09:53.220
What, do you just think I'm making baby noises into the phone?

09:53.220 --> 09:54.970
Mom, that's crazy.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.760
All right, bye. Say bye, Charlie.

10:01.150 --> 10:04.130
Not that I'm in the position to criticize,

10:04.130 --> 10:06.530
But I was getting more monkey.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.070
Come on, let's go to the park.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.310
And meet the girl who blew off PJ?

10:11.310 --> 10:13.240
I'm there.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.670
- I don't see her. - PJ, what did she look like?

10:24.670 --> 10:27.590
She was hot, but what does it matter?

10:27.590 --> 10:29.790
Maybe we should call someone.

10:29.790 --> 10:32.130
who do you call when you search a baby.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.760
Captain Stretchy!

10:33.760 --> 10:35.630
What is that?

10:37.200 --> 10:37.940
You're still here?

10:37.940 --> 10:40.470
Every saturday and sunday all day long.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.890
Stay in school, kids.

10:42.890 --> 10:45.170
Just the guy we needed to see.

10:45.170 --> 10:46.950
I think you can help us.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.510
Hey, kid, I'm just an entertainer.

10:48.510 --> 10:51.110
I can't get mommy and daddy back together.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.780
No, you don't understand.

10:52.780 --> 10:54.450
I was talking to a girl here earlier,

10:54.450 --> 10:56.850
And she said that you worked a party for her brother.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.680
So? I work lots of parties.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.320
Where was the party where you fell on cake?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.360
You got three hours?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.660
This is really important. We need to find her.

11:04.660 --> 11:08.330
Interesting situation. You kids need info,

11:08.330 --> 11:12.580
- And I need a mirdle. - What is a mirdle?

11:12.590 --> 11:16.420
That's a man girdle. And they ain't cheap.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.170
Yeah, neither is dry cleaning, apparently.

11:18.170 --> 11:21.540
Her name's Emma. Did she come back to the park?

11:21.540 --> 11:23.980
Well, maybe she did

11:23.980 --> 11:25.710
And maybe she didn't.

11:25.710 --> 11:29.050
Stop rubbing your fingers together and answer my question.

11:29.050 --> 11:31.400
He wants a bribe.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.820
I can't believe it.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.520
Here.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.830
Here is what I konw: Her name is Emma.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.130
I just told you that.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.560
I didn't say the information was fresh.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.400
Yeah, I know the girl.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.870
She comes from a big family-- seven, eight kids.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.340
For them I've been...

11:48.340 --> 11:50.510
Astronaut Pete, cowboy Bob...

11:50.510 --> 11:53.680
- Magic Marv? - Yeah! You're familiar with my work.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.780
Yeah, and it stinks.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.380
I'm just starting off

11:59.380 --> 12:02.430
- And I'm a better magician than you are. - Oh yeah?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.440
You think this is easy, huh? here.

12:04.440 --> 12:08.020
Turn that into a schnauzer.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.190
You can't do it, huh?

12:10.190 --> 12:13.860
Maybe it's because you don't have the chops!

12:15.060 --> 12:17.620
Well, Stretchy, do you know where she lives?

12:17.620 --> 12:19.600
Yeah, around here somewhere.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.670
- I'd know it if I saw it. - Great!

12:21.670 --> 12:23.120
Now you help us tonight and we'll

12:23.120 --> 12:24.620
get you into that mirdle tomorrow.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.940
Oh, and you understand we're not actually

12:26.940 --> 12:30.040
Gonna put you into it? That you have to do by yourself.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.460
Yeah, I get it.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.330
All right, come on, guys, we have to go find her.

12:33.330 --> 12:36.890
Uh, hey-- Captain Stretchy, away!

12:36.890 --> 12:38.970
- Truck's this way. - Oh, okay.

12:43.980 --> 12:47.510
Order whatever you want, honey. I get a discount here.

12:47.510 --> 12:49.800
This place is one of my best customers.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.370
Not what you want to hear from an exterminator.

12:53.370 --> 12:56.340
Oh, look at that.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.340
Oh, fajitas.

12:59.340 --> 13:01.940
Not that, the baby.

13:01.940 --> 13:05.110
A little baby in a stroller just like ours.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.970
Yeah, okay, honey,

13:06.970 --> 13:08.720
This is supposed to be a night away from the baby.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.220
So let's come back.

13:10.220 --> 13:12.120
Okay okay, I'm back.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.920
I'm back. Just gotta run to the ladies' room.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.960
Oh oh, hey, listen, while you're in there,

13:17.960 --> 13:21.160
Could you check the traps?

13:27.740 --> 13:30.340
Hola.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.440
Adios.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.480
Bob, will you go over and look at that baby?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.110
- I think it's Charlie. - What?!

13:38.110 --> 13:39.860
You heard me, that is Charlie!

13:39.870 --> 13:41.420
Sweetheart, would you sit down, please?

13:41.420 --> 13:42.600
I will not sit down.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.370
A mother knows her own baby and that is my baby.

13:45.370 --> 13:49.120
Honey, seriously, what do you think happened here?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.740
In the last hour somebody went over to our house,

13:51.740 --> 13:54.830
Borrowed our baby then brought her out for chips and guac?

13:54.830 --> 13:56.710
I don't know, it's a big family.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.170
- Maybe that's how they get their babies. - Sweetheart,

14:01.170 --> 14:03.300
I think you're just missing Charlie

14:03.310 --> 14:06.740
And you're having a little separation anxiety.

14:06.740 --> 14:09.760
Oh, okay.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.150
You're right.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.980
Crazy wazy.

14:15.180 --> 14:18.520
- I mean, that isn't possible, right? - Exactly.

14:18.520 --> 14:22.570
I'm just going to go to the ladies' room one more time.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.830
Sit down.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.400
Now let's enjoy the rest of our night out

14:27.400 --> 14:29.930
At this very lovely restaurant.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.920
- Okay? - Okay.

14:34.770 --> 14:37.170
I'm needed in the kitchen.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.220
- Charlie! - Emma!

14:48.220 --> 14:50.220
- Charlie! - Emma!

14:50.220 --> 14:52.520
- Marco! - Polo.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.260
Gabe, not helping.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.490
Stretchy, is any of this looking familiar?

14:56.490 --> 14:58.590
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.730
You are not getting any more money.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.400
No, I have night blindness.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.500
All I'm seeing is shapes.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.810
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

15:06.810 --> 15:08.200
I needed a ride home.

15:08.200 --> 15:12.110
Stop here.

15:12.110 --> 15:15.640
Oh, great. Mom's up.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.000
Maybe I'll just hang with you kids.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.250
Captain Stretchy, away.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.520
- Good night, Stretchy. - Good night, Stretchy.

15:29.530 --> 15:31.460
Good night.

15:31.460 --> 15:32.610
Now what?

15:32.610 --> 15:36.060
We didn't hit the streets on the north end of the park.

15:36.070 --> 15:38.330
PJ, we can't keep driving around all night.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.100
It's over. We have to tell mom and dad.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.670
- But-- - No, it'll be okay.

15:41.670 --> 15:43.640
They know what to do. They always do.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.080
How am I gonna tell them I lost our baby sister?

15:50.250 --> 15:53.580
I'm the oldest. They're gonna think I'm the most responsible.

15:53.580 --> 15:56.880
PJ, if it makes you feel any better,

15:56.890 --> 15:59.750
Nobody thinks that.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.930
Why do I always mess everything up?

16:07.100 --> 16:10.400
You know what? This could have happened to any of us.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.140
All right, probably most likely you, but--

16:14.140 --> 16:17.270
This one, we're all in it together.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.840
Thanks.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.580
Hey, look,

16:24.580 --> 16:27.180
Captain Stretchy dropped his driver's license.

16:27.180 --> 16:31.320
175 lbs, my butt!

16:49.570 --> 16:51.260
There they are.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.390
All right, let's get this over with.

16:53.390 --> 16:55.550
Do you think it would be better or worse

16:55.550 --> 16:57.710
if we had the mariachi deliver the news.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.400
If it's in spanish, probably better.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.150
Wait, I don't believe it.

17:03.150 --> 17:05.089
- That's Emma. - So that's Charlie.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.849
Yes! Oh, we're saved.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.690
- Not quite. - Hey, kids.

17:11.130 --> 17:15.030
- What now? - I'll let you know when I think of it.

17:15.030 --> 17:17.500
Mom, dad, hi.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.069
- Hi. - What are you doing here?

17:19.069 --> 17:21.839
We just realized you must be missing Charlie,

17:21.839 --> 17:23.369
So we brought her.

17:23.369 --> 17:26.440
Oh, Teddy, you're not fooling me.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.980
- I'm not? - Nope.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.180
You spent a little too much time with Charlie

17:30.180 --> 17:32.080
And you're ready to hand her over early.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.850
Well, I wouldn't say too much time.

17:35.850 --> 17:38.220
Well, I am ready too, so let me at her.

17:38.220 --> 17:40.520
- Gimme Gimme Gimme. - Mom, Mom, Mom.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.940
You're on a date. Let me bring her to you.

17:46.950 --> 17:49.230
Here? Wait, now?

17:49.230 --> 17:51.200
Well, all right.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.100
- Hey, mom. - Hi, baby.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.540
- Hey. - Hey, dad.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.940
- Something I want to show you. - What is it, honey?

18:49.690 --> 18:52.160
And now for my next trick,

18:52.160 --> 18:55.200
I'm gonna make a boy disappear.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.440
You know, you should be ashamed of yourself.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.310
You lead a guy on, make him think you have a connection,

19:04.310 --> 19:07.110
And you give him a fake phone number.

19:07.110 --> 19:10.310
You put it in wrong. that three is supposed to be a two.

19:11.730 --> 19:14.120
Oh, my bad.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.680
So...

19:16.690 --> 19:19.150
You wanna get a table?

19:22.410 --> 19:26.910
My widdle baby, did you miss your mommy and daddy?

19:26.910 --> 19:29.830
Yes, she did. yes, she did.

19:32.050 --> 19:35.140
Oh, I never thought I'd be so happy to hear baby talk.

19:36.870 --> 19:39.370
Teddy, this isn't Charlie's binky. where did you get this?

19:39.370 --> 19:41.890
Oh, well, that's actually a really funny story.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.050
See, what happened was...

19:45.900 --> 19:48.150
Too loud. Tell you later.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.830
Well, Charlie, now you're home safe and sound

20:02.830 --> 20:04.650
And everything turned out okay.

20:04.650 --> 20:06.270
For you.

20:06.270 --> 20:09.270
It would have been okay for us too, but when we got home,

20:09.270 --> 20:11.460
Mom started asking all these questions

20:11.460 --> 20:13.480
And no one really had an answer to

20:13.480 --> 20:15.510
the pee stains in the living room.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.010
And that's when the truth came out

20:19.010 --> 20:20.880
and all the kids got into trouble.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.810
So the lesson is if you ever try

20:22.810 --> 20:24.550
to pull anything over on Mom,

20:24.550 --> 20:27.940
Good luck, Charlie.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.890
Couldn't have said it better myself.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.550
In this hand I have a quarter.

20:38.550 --> 20:42.090
And in the other hand, an ordinary egg.

20:42.090 --> 20:45.870
Now I put them in this hat,

20:45.870 --> 20:49.210
Spin them around and...

20:49.210 --> 20:53.100
Presto! Now hold out your hand.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.860
Wow, that's a great trick.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.410
How'd you do that?

21:03.410 --> 21:06.280
Interesting situation.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.580
It seems you need information,

21:08.580 --> 21:12.280
Meanwhile I need a new video game.

21:17.260 --> 21:19.510
What a chump.

21:19.510 --> 21:23.040
Who you calling a chump? Hey, get back here.
