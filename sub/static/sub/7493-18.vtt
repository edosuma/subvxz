WEBVTT

00:04.125 --> 00:06.875
I can't believe Kim's finally moving
back home from Japan.

00:06.959 --> 00:08.583
Did Rudy get
the "Welcome Home" banner yet?

00:08.667 --> 00:09.542
Guys.

00:10.458 --> 00:13.083
I found the perfect banner
in the clearance section.

00:18.208 --> 00:20.959
Oh, and I know
the perfect place to put it.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.500
Well, Jack's freaking out
because of Kim coming home.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.041
He said he didn't have anything to wear,

00:30.125 --> 00:32.250
so I went and bought him an outfit.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.458
- What do you think?
<i>Oh...</i>

00:35.542 --> 00:36.417
Looking good!

00:36.500 --> 00:38.375
- Terrible.
- Unbelievably bad.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.458
Thanks a lot, Milton!

00:40.542 --> 00:42.041
Gah!

00:44.166 --> 00:46.709
Relax, Jack. Kim's gonna be
so excited to see you,

00:46.792 --> 00:48.375
she's not even gonna care
what you're wearing.

00:48.458 --> 00:50.458
Kim!
-

00:50.542 --> 00:52.625
- Hey!
- Milton, Jerry, Rudy...

00:52.709 --> 00:54.208
Oh, what are you wearing?

00:55.709 --> 00:57.500
Oh, guys, I brought someone
I want you to meet.

00:57.583 --> 00:59.250
He's very special to me.

00:59.917 --> 01:01.291
I knew it!

01:01.375 --> 01:03.333
She runs off to some far away country

01:03.417 --> 01:05.917
and gets swept off her feet
by some exotic guy

01:06.000 --> 01:08.917
with an accent and a, a shiny bald head.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.166
You're gonna miss this, sister!

01:14.125 --> 01:18.000
Guys, this is Grandmaster Tomo,
headmaster at Otai.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.000
Oh.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.667
Ah! You must be Sensei Rudy.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.959
I've come because two
of the finest students I have ever seen

01:26.041 --> 01:28.166
have trained at this dojo.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.000
- Thank you.
- We do what we can.

01:30.792 --> 01:33.208
- I was talking about Kim and Jack.
- Mmm.

01:33.291 --> 01:35.750
- Makes sense.
- Much better choice.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.959
Rudy, we are considering
offering you a position

01:39.041 --> 01:42.375
- as grandmaster at the Otai Academy.
- Oh.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.542
Oh, that'd mean
he'd have to move to Japan.

01:45.375 --> 01:46.709
Wait, Rudy's leaving us?

01:46.792 --> 01:49.750
Jerry, relax,
this is a really big decision.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.709
Uh, Rudy loves this dojo
more than anything.

01:51.792 --> 01:53.750
He's gonna wanna take time
to weigh in all of his--

01:53.834 --> 01:56.709
I'll be in the car, Tomo!
Dojo's yours, Jack!

02:39.333 --> 02:41.500
Before we can offer you the position,

02:41.583 --> 02:43.625
we need to know more about you.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.625
We'll be talking to people that know you.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.542
I'll be returning tomorrow
to interview your students.

02:50.834 --> 02:53.792
My students will give you
the whole truth on Rudy Gillespie,

02:54.291 --> 02:55.583
because as sensei,

02:55.667 --> 02:58.041
I have taught them that
there is nothing more important

02:58.125 --> 03:00.208
than honesty and integrity.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.375
-
- You guys are gonna lie

03:04.458 --> 03:06.125
like you have never lied before!

03:07.041 --> 03:09.083
Rudy, shouldn't we just tell the truth?

03:09.166 --> 03:10.583
Yeah. What, are you worried

03:10.667 --> 03:12.458
we're gonna say something
embarrassing about you?

03:12.542 --> 03:14.667
Yes. Yes, I am.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.208
- Sometimes I can be...
- A nut loaf?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.333
I was gonna say, "slightly imperfect,"

03:21.417 --> 03:23.834
but "nut loaf" works, too.

03:23.917 --> 03:27.041
Now here's a few things that you're
absolutely not allowed to talk about.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.000
Oh! Oh!

03:31.542 --> 03:32.625
Ah!

03:35.583 --> 03:37.166
-
- What... Oh!

03:37.250 --> 03:39.291
You guys want me to rev this baby up,
get some attention?

03:39.375 --> 03:40.709
No! No!
- On it!

03:49.458 --> 03:52.125
I'll rock any pipe you've got, brosef.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.834
- Just go for it! Whoo!
- Rudy!

03:58.417 --> 04:00.417
It's totally worthless.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.291
There's nothing here! Nothing here!

04:05.166 --> 04:09.333
<i>Ja.</i> I'm Rudy's cousin,
Arnold Schwarzenrudy.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.625
Look at me, I'm so very huge.

04:14.083 --> 04:17.083
And... I think that about covers it...

04:18.250 --> 04:20.625
Unless anyone can think of any other times

04:20.709 --> 04:21.959
that I embarrassed myself.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.041
Okay, we don't have time for this!

04:25.291 --> 04:28.625
You guys got a big day tomorrow
of making me look good.

04:31.709 --> 04:34.458
So, Milton, at the Otai academy,

04:34.542 --> 04:37.959
we believe that great leadership
creates a peaceful dojo.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.375
Would you say that is true here?

04:40.709 --> 04:42.333
Uh...

04:42.417 --> 04:44.750
You know what? That is it!
I am so done with you!

04:44.834 --> 04:46.250
- I'm done with you!
- Ah!

04:47.875 --> 04:50.583
No! That's it!

04:54.375 --> 04:56.625
You left me waiting in the park
for the past two hours!

04:56.709 --> 04:57.917
Hey!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.166
- How dare you?
-

05:00.250 --> 05:03.041
- Get off!
-

05:03.917 --> 05:05.041
I would...

05:08.417 --> 05:10.750
I would definitely say
that Rudy's leadership

05:10.834 --> 05:13.333
has created a peaceful dojo.

05:14.834 --> 05:17.750
Ah. This coffee's terrible.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.250
Jack, at Otai we believe
it's very important

05:26.375 --> 05:28.875
that a grandmaster puts
his students before himself.

05:28.959 --> 05:31.583
Would you describe Rudy as selfless?

05:31.667 --> 05:32.875
Uh...

05:32.959 --> 05:35.208
Hey, show a little respect.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.291
You're talking to a man who's won...

05:37.917 --> 05:40.083
Two Oscars, a Nobel Peace Prize,

05:40.166 --> 05:42.208
and the Heisman. Oh.

05:42.291 --> 05:44.125
All right, now before we get started,

05:44.208 --> 05:46.709
I just wanna say that
when people come into sudden wealth,

05:46.792 --> 05:48.208
it can sometimes change 'em.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.041
Friends have been known
to turn on one another.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.709
The miners called it gold fever.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.750
I just want you to know that that's...

05:54.166 --> 05:55.959
exactly what's gonna happen to me.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.917
But rest assured,
as you're out there facing certain death,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.125
I will be right beside...

06:02.208 --> 06:04.166
my toasty fire...

06:05.792 --> 06:07.667
where I'll be writing
a letter of condolence

06:07.750 --> 06:10.291
to Officer Nate's hot wife, Annabelle.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.083
All I need is another thousand bucks
and it's mine.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.625
Guys, I just counted. We have $1,100.

06:17.709 --> 06:18.834
Oh, thank you.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.000
Uh...

06:27.291 --> 06:30.792
Selfless. So very selfless is he.

06:35.959 --> 06:40.083
Jerry, a leader cannot be great
if he does not respect those he leads.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.959
Has Rudy taught you
to be respectful to each other?

06:44.041 --> 06:45.458
Uh...

06:45.542 --> 06:49.583
It's called the Jerry Zone,
so step off, Not Jerry.

06:49.667 --> 06:50.750
What career?

06:50.834 --> 06:53.500
I've had zits that
lasted longer than your career!

06:54.166 --> 06:56.709
Oh, come on!

06:56.792 --> 06:58.333
I think you should crawl back

06:58.375 --> 07:00.917
to whatever slop kitchen you oozed out of!

07:02.083 --> 07:04.500
Do you wanna learn
the ancient martial art...

07:05.291 --> 07:06.500
of Shin Do?

07:06.583 --> 07:08.709
I Shin-Don't.

07:09.709 --> 07:11.500
Well, when I see something wrong,

07:11.583 --> 07:13.750
it's my job to do something about it!

07:14.709 --> 07:16.500
Why don't you do something
about your breath?

07:16.583 --> 07:18.417
You could use a mint, sister!

07:19.625 --> 07:20.875
Uh...

07:26.041 --> 07:28.291
Respectful. Very, very respectful.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.917
Dojo's full of respect.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.291
Thank you, Jerry.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.417
I've learned everything I need to know.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.208
Look who just got a shipment
of 16-pound bowling balls!

07:48.750 --> 07:51.917
- Oh!
-

07:54.250 --> 07:56.041
- <i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>
-

07:56.125 --> 07:59.000
Grandmaster Tomo, I am so glad...

07:59.083 --> 08:02.000
Oh. Great. It's just you.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.083
-
- Grandmaster Tomo!

08:08.166 --> 08:09.709
I am so glad...

08:09.792 --> 08:12.792
Oh. Great. It's just you.

08:15.959 --> 08:18.709
-
- Grandmaster Tomo!

08:18.792 --> 08:20.750
I am so glad...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.000
Oh. Great. It's just you.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.583
Grandmaster Tomo!

08:30.667 --> 08:32.250
I'm so...

08:32.291 --> 08:33.417
...tired.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.583
I'm just gonna stay up here.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.250
After talking to your students,

08:39.291 --> 08:43.959
I made the decision about making you
a grandmaster at Otai, and it's--

08:44.041 --> 08:45.792
Yes! Yes! I knew it!

08:45.875 --> 08:48.792
So long, suckers! Grandmaster out!

08:49.500 --> 08:51.709
My answer is no.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.709
- What?
- Wait, why?

08:53.792 --> 08:58.250
Because I know Rudy
was spying on our interviews.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.166
He clearly has something to hide.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.041
If you cannot trust your students,

09:03.542 --> 09:05.208
I cannot trust you.

09:05.291 --> 09:07.709
What? I'm not gonna...

09:08.417 --> 09:11.291
But I told people
and I moved out of mother...

09:11.834 --> 09:13.125
my apartment.

09:14.542 --> 09:15.709
Uh, Grandmaster Tomo,

09:15.792 --> 09:17.583
you're probably gonna want
to take a step this way.

09:17.667 --> 09:18.542
- Yeah.
- Why?

09:18.625 --> 09:20.542
Sensei going down!

09:26.250 --> 09:27.208
That's why.

09:35.166 --> 09:38.000
I can't believe Grandmaster Tomo
didn't give Rudy the job.

09:38.083 --> 09:39.583
- How's he taking it?
-

09:39.667 --> 09:41.041
<i>-</i>

09:45.875 --> 09:47.375
Hey, it's better than expected.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.583
Guys, we gotta do something.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.125
Tomo doesn't know the real Rudy.

09:53.208 --> 09:54.583
But we do.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.750
He's the best sensei
that we could ever hope for.

09:57.834 --> 10:00.250
Anyone could ever hope for.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.959
Tomo needs to know that.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.125
How did you get outside?

10:06.208 --> 10:07.917
There's no exit in the locker room.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.291
There is now.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.250
Time to go put in a skylight.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.500
Thanks for agreeing to meet with us.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.583
Uh, you said you didn't know who Rudy was,

10:20.667 --> 10:22.125
which is fair.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.583
Sometimes we don't even know.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.834
Oh, I'm like a Dutch oven with a cape!

10:29.917 --> 10:32.375
Uh, excuse me, ma'am, I'm sorry.
We're closed.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.542
It's me.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.375
I'm feeling lucky, baby!

10:43.375 --> 10:45.792
- Okay, is Rudy a bit of a crazy person?
- Oh, yeah.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.417
- No doubt.
- You better believe it.

10:48.458 --> 10:52.000
But he's also the greatest sensei
a student could ask for.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.417
Before I came to the dojo
I was just a skate punk.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.333
Dude, I was a troublemaker.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.000
You're not gonna believe this, but I--

10:59.083 --> 11:00.750
You were a nerd.

11:01.792 --> 11:02.750
How'd you know?

11:02.834 --> 11:04.333
You're still a nerd.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.959
We're not gonna let you leave
until you hear the truth about Rudy.

11:14.291 --> 11:16.583
So I'm not good enough
to be a grandmaster?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.625
Fine.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.208
I don't need a dojo!

11:23.792 --> 11:25.542
I don't need any of this!

11:26.291 --> 11:28.500
Except for that blender.

11:31.375 --> 11:33.917
Other than this, I don't need anything.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.417
I kinda need this stool.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.583
I need this blender and I need this stool,
and that is it!

11:42.959 --> 11:44.959
God, that's a really nice bowl of fruit.

11:46.041 --> 11:47.208
You know what?

11:47.291 --> 11:49.000
I am taking the whole juice bar.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.208
You are coming with me, juice bar!

11:56.291 --> 11:59.583
Rudy, I need to speak to you.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.375
Tough! I don't need anything from you!

12:03.291 --> 12:04.667
Except for this pen.

12:07.125 --> 12:10.041
Rudy, I have had a meeting
with your students

12:10.125 --> 12:13.083
and they finally told me
the truth about you.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.667
Oh, great.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.750
So now you know
that I chew on my toenails,

12:16.834 --> 12:18.333
I wear diapers to long movies,

12:18.417 --> 12:20.208
and I got banned
from the petting zoo for--

12:20.291 --> 12:21.417
Rudy!

12:22.542 --> 12:23.959
We didn't tell him any of those things.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.709
Good, because none
of those things are true.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.333
I've really misjudged you.

12:29.917 --> 12:34.667
I have never seen students so loyal
to their sensei.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.291
They've truly shown me
what kind of man you are,

12:38.417 --> 12:41.291
and we'd be honored to have you at Otai.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.208
Yes, get in here.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.917
You guys stink.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.542
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

12:57.625 --> 13:00.417
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you ♪</i>

13:01.125 --> 13:04.917
All right, since we spend most of our time
making fun of Rudy behind his back,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.500
we thought, before he leaves,

13:06.583 --> 13:08.375
why not do it in front of his face?

13:08.458 --> 13:12.000
-
- With "The Roast of Rudy Gillespie."

13:12.083 --> 13:13.500
-
- All right.

13:16.375 --> 13:17.875
Okay, okay.

13:17.959 --> 13:21.875
Uh, as you know, a roast is when
you make fun of someone

13:21.959 --> 13:24.709
in a good-natured and loving way.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.625
This is my first roast, so here it goes.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.291
Rudy, you are a hideous little man
and nobody likes you.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.000
Honestly, you have no friends.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.458
I hope you die alone.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.917
Oh, "die alone!"

13:43.000 --> 13:44.875
Phil, oh, terrific.

13:49.208 --> 13:52.458
Oh, Rudy's a terrific guy,

13:52.542 --> 13:55.458
and I'm shocked
that he's the only man in Seaford

13:55.542 --> 13:57.166
that I haven't asked out yet.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.792
That's not a joke, stretch.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.959
But seriously, Rudy, um...

14:04.041 --> 14:05.125
How about you and I--

14:05.208 --> 14:07.000
Ah, keep it moving!

14:07.083 --> 14:08.291
You'll be back.

14:09.959 --> 14:13.291
Anyway, coming to work
has been a whole lot more fun

14:13.375 --> 14:15.709
because of Rudy and,

14:15.792 --> 14:17.208
and all you guys.

14:17.542 --> 14:20.792
- You feel the burn?
- Whoo-whee! I feel it!

14:21.875 --> 14:25.500
Hey, look, my butt's looking
better already.

14:25.583 --> 14:28.458
You might have a touch
of the Madagascar Madness.

14:28.542 --> 14:31.333
What makes you say that? I feel fine.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.583
I should probably call a doctor.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.709
- No, you're not calling anyone.
-

14:35.750 --> 14:38.083
I never felt so alive!

14:44.625 --> 14:47.208
Please enjoy your free beach experience.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.291
Mm-hmm. That's what I thought.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.959
Ah!

14:51.875 --> 14:53.709
- Fire in the hole!
-

14:56.834 --> 15:00.000
Not only is Rudy a sensei,

15:00.583 --> 15:03.625
but he's a businessman and entrepreneur.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.250
And he's equally terrible at all three!

15:09.166 --> 15:12.583
- That was a joke.
- No, it... it wasn't.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.500
A lot of the times, people may say
I'm not the sharpest bulb in the shed,

15:19.583 --> 15:21.250
but that is simply not false.

15:22.959 --> 15:24.959
You're talking into a pepper mill.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
- Dummy.
-

15:29.667 --> 15:31.375
What is wrong with this thing?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.583
Hey.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.291
Despite what we've just heard,

15:38.375 --> 15:40.792
everybody knows that Rudy is our friend.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.750
Rudy, I hate your face!

15:46.208 --> 15:47.250
Classic.

15:49.750 --> 15:55.500
But as our sensei, he helped us grow
from kids into the Wasabi Warriors.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.917
- Wasabi!
-

16:42.208 --> 16:43.166
Rudy.

16:43.875 --> 16:44.959
We love you.

16:46.041 --> 16:49.166
And we want to present you
with this ceremonial belt.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.125
Wow.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.500
This is the ugliest thing
anyone's ever given me.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.125
We've made it from pieces of every belt
you've helped us earn.

17:04.875 --> 17:08.000
This is the most beautiful thing
anyone's ever given me.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.500
Keep it together, Rudy.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.583
Letting 'em see you cry
is a sign of weakness.

17:20.583 --> 17:24.583
I am going to miss you!

17:26.542 --> 17:29.166
- Do you wanna go on a date?
- I gotta go.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.417
I am so thankful
for the honor of being a grandmaster.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.959
And I just want you to know

17:41.041 --> 17:44.000
that I'm gonna be the same humble Rudy
that I've always been.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.667
Good to hear, Rudy.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.750
Here is your plane ticket.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.875
Coach?

17:49.959 --> 17:51.458
You expect me to fly coach?

17:51.542 --> 17:53.291
I'm a grandmaster, baby.

17:54.542 --> 17:57.583
Yeah, no, no, coach is good.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.417
Here are the profiles
to your black belt students

18:00.500 --> 18:01.917
at Otai.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.709
Wait, where are all the white belts?

18:08.792 --> 18:10.542
We have no white belts.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.291
You will be grandmaster to students

18:13.375 --> 18:15.458
who are already champions.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.000
I'll go see if the car is here.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.917
Hey, I wonder who
the new head sensei will be.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.625
Well, hopefully me. I interviewed for it.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.625
So if, uh, we go in there
and I'm waiting to meet us,

18:46.709 --> 18:49.083
- don't be surprised.
- Just go.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.458
Rudy, what are you doing here?

18:57.750 --> 18:59.709
I decided to stay.

18:59.792 --> 19:00.834
Why?

19:00.917 --> 19:03.375
Well, because you guys showed me
that here...

19:04.208 --> 19:05.667
I can make a difference.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.625
Look, you can have
all the money in the world,

19:08.709 --> 19:10.542
but if you don't have
what we have right here,

19:10.625 --> 19:11.625
you got nothing.

19:13.208 --> 19:14.208
To friends.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.333
Jerry, volunteering can be very rewarding.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.750
What was it that you were supposed to do?

19:20.834 --> 19:23.583
I was supposed to bring meals
and help out some old man.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.834
Well, not only are you gonna do it,

19:25.917 --> 19:27.291
but I'm gonna go with you!

19:27.417 --> 19:29.166
And no matter where life takes us,

19:29.250 --> 19:31.667
we'll always be connected
by the Wasabi code.

19:33.709 --> 19:35.125
One final Wasabi?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.291
Wasabi!

19:42.959 --> 19:44.375
Nice. Again.

19:45.792 --> 19:46.750
That was good.

19:46.834 --> 19:47.834
All this...

19:47.917 --> 19:49.625
Just so we can go on a date.

19:49.709 --> 19:52.083
You know what? You're worth it.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.792
Kick!

19:54.875 --> 19:56.166
Kick!

19:56.625 --> 19:59.041
Jerry, why'd you do this for me?

19:59.125 --> 20:00.917
What I did was wrong, bro.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.333
I shouldn't have taken credit
for something you did.

20:03.417 --> 20:04.375
Thanks, Jerry.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.417
Congratulations, Jerry.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.500
You're now a black belt.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.750
- Thank you, sensei.
- Look at you, man. I'm so proud.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.542
They say you never forget your first love.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.000
And I know I never will.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.291
Remember what Rudy said,

20:26.166 --> 20:29.417
no matter where we go,
we'll always be connected.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.208
I can't believe
how far you guys have come.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.709
- Look at you! Come on!
- Oh, yeah!

20:41.125 --> 20:43.166
We're really glad
you decided to stay, man.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.250
We know you're gonna be able to help
a lot of other kids.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.291
They tried to make you
fly coach, didn't they?

20:49.375 --> 20:51.542
It's none of your business, Kim!

20:53.792 --> 20:55.125
Welcome home, sensei.

20:58.417 --> 20:59.667
All right, now line up.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.542
- Hup!
- Hup! Hup!

21:05.625 --> 21:06.959
Wasabi!

21:08.959 --> 21:10.834
- All four cameras.
-

21:10.917 --> 21:13.041
I would make the perfect General Douglas!

21:17.500 --> 21:19.125
Uh... Oh, no...

21:19.208 --> 21:20.208
What's the line?

21:21.291 --> 21:23.375
And that's all the letters
of the alphabet.

21:23.458 --> 21:25.500
Well, that's still too many.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.375
- A traitor.
-

21:29.000 --> 21:30.291
You need to hit the gym, bro.

21:57.041 --> 21:58.000
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.000 --> 22:02.959
<i>Yes!</i>
