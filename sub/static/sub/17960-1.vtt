STORM RIDER

02:27.883 --> 02:30.845
Sweetheart, you took
the competition by storm.

02:30.929 --> 02:33.723
- Oh, thanks dad.
- Mm, so proud of you.

02:34.182 --> 02:36.110
When the rest of the
competition is here too?

02:36.193 --> 02:38.061
Well, don't get too confident.

02:38.144 --> 02:40.689
Dad, it's called being the best,
not being over-confident.

02:40.772 --> 02:48.431
- I want a horse too.
- Oh! No. You know it's nearly four.

02:49.572 --> 02:54.161
I know what time it is.
Excuse me. Yeah?

02:56.037 --> 02:59.249
No, I told you that
account's in the Caymans.

03:01.541 --> 03:04.604
- Daddy?
- Yes.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.156
- What's Dad mad at?
- Well, I don't know.

03:14.264 --> 03:18.227
- Probably something work related.
- He and mom has been fighting.

03:18.543 --> 03:22.147
They kind of fight all the time.
Will figure that out.

03:22.231 --> 03:24.650
Didn't with your mom.

03:29.573 --> 03:30.864
Hi!

03:34.576 --> 03:38.206
- Hi, Brooke. Want some popcorn?
- No, thanks, Jordan.

03:38.832 --> 03:43.085
- You know, my answer hasn't changed.
- But you know we'll pay you a price.

03:43.168 --> 03:50.685
- I'm not selling Admiral.
- You can probably find a better horse.

03:53.346 --> 03:57.665
- Maybe you're right.
- Yeah. Maybe it'll sprout wings too.

04:11.114 --> 04:16.512
George, George listen to me.  Ok that's
why you're in a six-figure retainer.

04:18.329 --> 04:24.269
No, I don't care.  No!
Just get me a continuance.

04:26.839 --> 04:30.800
No. Are you telling me that you
can't just buy me a couple of days?

04:32.761 --> 04:35.265
I need a new lawyer.

04:35.348 --> 04:38.099
No, you figure it out!

04:44.815 --> 04:46.818
Hey, here you go.

04:49.529 --> 04:52.322
Maybe you should ask for the horse.
For your birthday.

04:52.406 --> 04:55.576
- You think I'm good enough?
You're my little brother, aren't you?

04:55.658 --> 04:57.453
Half brother.

04:58.996 --> 05:02.374
- Got this in town for you.
- Yeah. What is it?

05:02.875 --> 05:07.003
- Cookies. Chocolate chip.
- Oh, my favorite.

05:10.192 --> 05:17.306
Hey, we're not half anything. You're my
younger brother and we're family. Got it?

05:18.098 --> 05:19.724
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:19.725 --> 05:21.911
I'm gonna go tell
Mom about the horse.

05:23.104 --> 05:25.982
You'd better hurry!
And eat your sandwich!

05:26.066 --> 05:29.444
Hey Mom, I know what I want for my...
Where are you going?

05:29.527 --> 05:33.565
Where are we going? We're
leaving.  I packed your suitcase.

05:33.648 --> 05:36.491
It's upstairs in your room.
Go get it and bring it downstairs.

05:36.576 --> 05:37.618
What?

05:37.702 --> 05:41.814
Go get it right now. We're leaving
and we're not coming back.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.634
There you are.
We're going.

05:54.217 --> 05:57.229
You're not going anywhere.
You're on the board.

05:57.596 --> 05:58.848
Not anymore.

05:58.932 --> 06:04.370
I had my lawyer divest me of any and
all holdings and positions in the company.

06:05.188 --> 06:08.399
- When did you do...?
- I am not going down with you, Mitch!

06:08.483 --> 06:13.280
Now, I know you have money
stashed offshore and I want my share.

06:13.363 --> 06:17.233
Even if I did stash money
overseas, you wouldn't see a dime.

06:17.450 --> 06:21.329
- Jordan will.
- What are you doing for money now?

06:21.747 --> 06:25.408
I sold my stocks and bonds
and I closed the house account.

06:25.585 --> 06:29.212
- And I sold some jewelry too.
- And that's gonna last you a week.

06:29.296 --> 06:31.633
Yah, at least I have a week.

06:39.515 --> 06:43.144
- Where are they going?
- Who cares?

06:56.073 --> 06:58.326
- Careful!
- What you got in here? Blocks?

06:58.409 --> 07:00.870
You mean like the
ones in your head.  Go.

07:00.952 --> 07:04.049
- How come I have to go with you?
- Don't argue.

07:04.874 --> 07:07.544
- Where are you guys going?
- Away.

07:08.586 --> 07:10.088
Wait, I forgot my hat.

07:10.171 --> 07:12.882
Well then it must not
have been very important.

07:16.969 --> 07:22.308
Go.  You don't seem
understand, we're in a hurry.

07:23.475 --> 07:24.904
But I forgot my hat!

07:24.986 --> 07:27.606
Oh, we'll get you another one.
Just go.

07:28.523 --> 07:32.360
The captain goes down with the
ship but the crew saves themselves.

07:34.571 --> 07:37.282
Jordan! Jordan!

07:38.367 --> 07:42.988
Jordan, wait!
Wait, I got your hat!

08:05.919 --> 08:09.565
So, how much will you lose?

08:11.566 --> 08:16.690
Everything, including Admiral.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.369
Is there something we could do?

08:23.370 --> 08:27.167
I can't even make change
for a parking meter right now.

08:27.375 --> 08:34.511
- They froze all my assets.
- I could buy Admiral from you.

08:35.717 --> 08:37.118
With what?

08:38.761 --> 08:42.890
I have money saved up.
And I could pay you...

08:46.894 --> 08:49.231
Admiral's 200 thousand dollars.

08:50.732 --> 08:53.335
They're going to seize him
along with everything else.

08:57.446 --> 09:02.930
- I'm so sorry.
- What's going to happen to you?

09:07.164 --> 09:09.793
I already know what's
going to happen to you.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.587
Me?

09:12.795 --> 09:17.640
I've made arrangements with Sam.
You're gonna stay with him.

09:18.343 --> 09:21.388
Uncle Sam?
No! Dad, I can take care of ...

09:21.472 --> 09:24.391
Sweetheart, you're minor.
Okay you stay with Sam,

09:24.475 --> 09:26.585
or they're going to put you through
a court appointed foster care system

09:26.669 --> 09:28.733
and I'm not going to let that happen.

10:03.221 --> 10:09.112
- I know how hard this must be.
- He'll have a good home. I promise.

10:22.157 --> 10:24.160
We're not half-anything.

10:34.947 --> 10:39.259
I've made arrangements with Sam.
You are going to stay with him.

10:40.369 --> 10:41.841
I'm so sorry.

10:45.765 --> 10:50.248
- So how's the gelding?
- Good. I still owe you for him, right?

10:50.270 --> 10:54.690
- It's okay.
- Well, I'll pay. I'm not poor, you know?

10:54.691 --> 10:57.568
I know that.  I told you
not to worry about it.

10:57.651 --> 11:03.346
- Gotta go.  I got a guest to pick up.
- Guest? You have a guest?

11:03.557 --> 11:06.723
Hey, don't say it like that.
I could have a guest.

11:07.005 --> 11:10.081
Well, there's time
for everything I guess.

11:36.859 --> 11:41.824
- Dani Fielding?
- Who wants to know?

11:41.859 --> 11:45.618
The sheriff sent me. He said
Dr. Sam had an emergency call so.

11:46.286 --> 11:49.010
I'm sorry, I'm Kevin Winslow.
I can grab these if you like.

11:49.013 --> 11:51.733
- I can get them.
- Are you sure?

11:51.833 --> 11:56.903
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Alright, suit yourself.

12:21.597 --> 12:27.253
- You were really good whistler.
- I am?  Well, thanks.

12:29.204 --> 12:33.768
- Do you know my uncle?
- Dr. Sam? Yeah. Everyone knows him.

12:34.251 --> 12:39.088
- Do you like him?
- Well, yeah.  Don't you?

12:40.174 --> 12:43.553
I don't know.  I only met
him once when I was six.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.363
Has he ever treated you for anything?

12:48.264 --> 12:53.111
For what?   Hoof and
mouth disease?  Get in.

12:54.605 --> 12:56.564
Wait, what?

13:15.542 --> 13:20.463
- You know your uncle's a vet? Right?
- Don't know.

13:35.438 --> 13:37.694
Diesel!  What's up buddy?
Who's a good puppy?

13:38.195 --> 13:41.229
What's up Diesel?
Who's a good boy?

13:42.946 --> 13:44.739
Need some help?

13:53.539 --> 13:55.124
Diesel huh?

13:56.374 --> 14:00.701
- Yeah.  A good name, huh?
- Yeah, if he's a tractor.

14:02.005 --> 14:06.069
- I'm  taking off.
- Okay. Thanks for the ride.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.512
Don't mention it.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.903
Hello?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.703
Hello?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.091
Uncle Sam?

14:52.432 --> 14:54.560
Is anybody home?

15:06.531 --> 15:10.034
Apparently he thinks
garbage takes itself out.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.290
Diesel, huh?

15:16.165 --> 15:18.376
You want to help me clean?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.591
Smart dog.

15:45.528 --> 15:49.239
It's a disaster.  Really.
It doesn't even feel like I'm on Earth.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.864
I miss you too.
Oh here I am.  I have to go ...

16:00.543 --> 16:02.546
You made it okay?

16:02.755 --> 16:08.844
Sorry, I didn't hear you come in.
The door was open.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.640
- Extra bedroom this way.
- Are you sure you can find it?

16:16.852 --> 16:20.063
I cleaned up the bed,
it was kind of covered up.

16:22.392 --> 16:24.227
I think you oughta found it.

16:24.228 --> 16:27.189
You know, I got chores.
So I want you to get settled down.

16:48.092 --> 16:50.428
That is much better.

17:12.450 --> 17:13.576
- They gave me...
- Doh!

17:16.481 --> 17:20.083
I'm sorry.  I guess you're not
used to having people around.

17:20.166 --> 17:25.339
No, no I'm not.
Are you hungry?

17:28.468 --> 17:31.429
- Maybe we could go out to eat.
- You like chilli?

17:36.016 --> 17:40.890
- Yeah, I guess.
- Don't you know?

17:41.647 --> 17:43.028
I like it, okay?

17:47.693 --> 17:49.321
I don't know what to do
with stuff in the bedroom,

17:49.404 --> 17:52.430
so I just threw them in the
living room.  I hope that's okay.

17:52.434 --> 17:56.578
I don't want you rearrange my house.
I won't know how to find anything.

17:56.662 --> 17:58.122
How do you find anything now?

17:58.206 --> 18:01.249
I have certain piles
I put certain things in.

18:02.876 --> 18:05.837
I can't afford a maid like some.

18:06.254 --> 18:10.219
We didn't have a maid, but
we didn't live like animals either.

18:10.968 --> 18:12.636
Don't you like animals?

18:12.719 --> 18:16.074
Oh, I love animals,
I just don't want to live like one.

18:16.433 --> 18:23.208
- You're kind of for yourself ain't you?
- I'm what? You live in a dump.

18:23.243 --> 18:24.908
Yeah, well nobody's
ever complained before.

18:24.991 --> 18:29.631
- Oh yah, like who's complaining? Diesel?
- Are you gonna eat or argue?

18:36.704 --> 18:40.207
So, do you know
about daddy's problems?

18:40.291 --> 18:41.457
Nope.

18:41.541 --> 18:44.794
- Don't you have an opinion?
- He goes his way, I go mine.

18:45.963 --> 18:48.590
What?  Did you get
into a fight or something?

18:48.674 --> 18:51.300
I know.
We had a disagreement.

18:51.634 --> 18:56.480
Now I have told him long time ago that
I didn't agree with his financial schemes

18:56.481 --> 18:58.350
and his "minerakina dogamamie" sense

18:58.434 --> 19:01.820
He doesn't have schemes, okay.
He's an honest man is.

19:02.103 --> 19:04.190
It that why he's in
trouble with the government?

19:04.239 --> 19:07.108
It's a misunderstanding.
He'll get it cleared up.

19:07.192 --> 19:10.362
I... well, hope he does.
And you can go home.

19:11.612 --> 19:13.741
You know what?
Maybe I'll just leave right now.

19:13.824 --> 19:16.077
- You can't right now.
- Okay. Why not?

19:17.035 --> 19:21.339
Well, because it's going to get dark soon.
How are you going to find your way?

19:25.253 --> 19:27.964
Fine.
I'm not hungry.

19:32.468 --> 19:34.595
What did I say?

19:47.691 --> 19:52.663
You can't leave right now, it's dark
outside.  I'll find my way just fine.

20:03.584 --> 20:06.627
Daddy wanted me to give this to you.

20:10.131 --> 20:16.346
And here are some cookies,
if you want 'em.  Chocolate chip.

20:23.686 --> 20:27.192
I guess I made it seem like
it was her fault, didn't I?

20:27.608 --> 20:30.235
You don't have to
always agree with me.

20:45.668 --> 20:48.546
What do you think?
Peace offering?

20:51.215 --> 20:54.927
I'm not apologizing,
I'm just being nice.

21:32.716 --> 21:35.636
Good morning.
I made you breakfast.

21:35.718 --> 21:41.148
- Thanks for the present.
- Yeah well.  It wasn't much.

21:43.768 --> 21:47.396
I don't eat meat.
I'm a vegetarian.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.954
Well, I'm a Sagittarian.
Here you go, Diesel.

22:00.451 --> 22:05.907
- Zucchini is a vegetables.
- Do you have any French dressing?

22:06.082 --> 22:07.918
Nope.

22:09.169 --> 22:11.463
- Salsa?
- No.

22:13.548 --> 22:17.982
- Do you have any condiments?
- Ketchup.

22:38.908 --> 22:42.694
- Really?
- Those were really good.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.422
- Sam.
- Jody.

22:55.256 --> 22:57.218
- Well, this must be Dani.
- Hi.

22:57.384 --> 22:59.147
Hi, Jody Peterson.

23:00.148 --> 23:04.356
Oh Sam, you must be
the worst cook in state.

23:04.391 --> 23:06.936
Her first day here and all
you give her is zucchini?

23:07.019 --> 23:10.000
Oh, I didn't know there
was a menu requirement.

23:10.006 --> 23:14.235
- You've been alone way too long.
- I'm not alone.  Am I Diesel?

23:16.237 --> 23:19.324
Here, honey.
Have one of this.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.830
Mmm, excellent.

23:28.291 --> 23:30.168
What? You didn't feed
her last night, neither?

23:30.251 --> 23:31.587
She didn't want any.

23:31.671 --> 23:35.090
Didn't want any what?
Your six-year-old chilli?

23:35.757 --> 23:37.426
What's wrong with chilli?

23:37.510 --> 23:41.013
You know, for a horse doctor,
you don't have much horse sense.

23:41.845 --> 23:44.162
You know, I wasn't feeding horses.

23:44.958 --> 23:48.911
Well here, Sam.  I brought you some pay
for the house call you made the other day.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.128
You don't owe me anything.
I told you already.

23:51.129 --> 23:53.185
What is it with women, anyway?

23:58.555 --> 24:03.459
- It takes some getting use to.
- Yeah, I figured that out.

24:03.660 --> 24:06.746
Yeah, he's never had to
care about anybody else.

24:06.830 --> 24:10.042
Because there's never been
anybody else around here.

24:10.126 --> 24:13.196
Especially not a...
young one like yourself.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.591
You know, that's just
something from Mars to him.

24:15.592 --> 24:19.981
Hmm, I thought this was Mars.

24:20.053 --> 24:21.988
You just hold your ground.

24:22.346 --> 24:26.434
Let that old rooster care about
somebody else for a change.

24:28.227 --> 24:32.773
He told me that you were some
sort of champion show rider.

24:33.315 --> 24:39.471
I am.  I had a thoroughbred.
His name was Admiral.

24:42.199 --> 24:47.462
- Did you have to give him up?
- I had to give up everything.

24:49.373 --> 24:53.012
Hey!
Why don't you come with me.

25:05.264 --> 25:07.000
You need to clean up that pigsty.

25:07.009 --> 25:10.646
- Oh yeah, I'll get around to it.
- When?  Fourth of July?

25:10.728 --> 25:14.024
- Wasn't thinking that soon.
- You know, she's been through a lot.

25:14.106 --> 25:16.402
You know what,
that ain't my fault.

25:16.485 --> 25:19.363
Well, she needs somebody who
loves and cares about her.

25:19.446 --> 25:22.491
I do that, just not at the same time.
Hi!

25:23.409 --> 25:27.162
Hey. Come here.
I've got something for you.

25:35.028 --> 25:37.465
Oh, he's adorable.

25:37.548 --> 25:41.640
- He's small, but he will grow.
- Oh hi, little guy.

25:42.052 --> 25:47.129
- And I want you to have him.
- Me?

25:47.164 --> 25:49.929
Yeah, it's... you know,
like a welcome present.

25:49.930 --> 25:51.199
A mule?

25:51.228 --> 25:56.079
Yeah, a perfect place for him.  Now we
already got one jackass around here.

26:00.947 --> 26:05.043
- He's had rough time.
- Well, what happened?

26:05.078 --> 26:09.621
Big storm up in Cedar Briggs.
His mum was killed by wolves.

26:10.081 --> 26:13.501
That much little guy huddled
in Cedars the next day.

26:13.584 --> 26:18.118
Well, it's the first time he hasn't
bitten anybody who got close to him.

26:18.507 --> 26:21.134
Not everybody is like you.

26:25.538 --> 26:28.183
So what you gonna name him?

26:31.519 --> 26:34.940
- Stormy.
- That's a good choice.

26:37.442 --> 26:42.406
Well, it was really nice meeting you.
You're gonna fit in just fine around here.

26:44.783 --> 26:47.210
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

26:54.001 --> 26:56.051
So you gonna train him?

26:56.795 --> 27:01.041
Stormy?
I don't think you can train a mule.

27:01.340 --> 27:04.448
Well you can't, but
you can outsmart him.

27:05.136 --> 27:07.263
Outsmart him?

27:09.600 --> 27:14.688
My back screen door squeaks.  Every
time, I open it, cats come running.

27:15.981 --> 27:17.693
Lucky you.

27:18.609 --> 27:22.278
Well, they know that I'm bringing them
food scraps.  Cats can't be trained either,

27:22.362 --> 27:25.573
but these are... based
on the screen door opening.

27:27.826 --> 27:29.913
You think I could
train Stormy like that?

27:29.997 --> 27:35.067
Sure.  If you work hard enough you
can get any animal to respond to you.

27:36.002 --> 27:39.064
Look, I gotta go and bags have
to went to a horse this morning.

27:39.165 --> 27:42.740
I'll be back in the afternoon.

27:47.180 --> 27:52.726
Look.  I'm sorry about your dad.
I hope he gets things worked out.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.645
Thanks.

27:59.151 --> 28:02.070
Of course a zebra
can't change its stripes.

28:08.785 --> 28:10.828
I forgot something in the house.
I'll be right back.

28:10.911 --> 28:12.455
That's alright.

28:14.207 --> 28:18.045
- How are you doing?
- Okay.  You?

28:18.461 --> 28:23.292
- I'm good. I heard you got a mule.
- Yeah.

28:23.342 --> 28:27.979
They're not worth much, you know?
Well, that's what my dad always says.

28:31.099 --> 28:33.352
- Okay, I'm ready to go.
- Sweet.

28:48.699 --> 28:54.001
Hi.
You're pretty cute.

29:02.548 --> 29:06.660
Okay.  It's okay.

29:07.561 --> 29:09.417
You're fine.

29:09.972 --> 29:11.765
You're okay.

30:25.842 --> 30:30.762
Hello? Dad!
When are you gonna...

30:35.809 --> 30:39.135
Yeah, but Dad, I really need
a new phone.  I can't even call...

30:41.856 --> 30:48.279
Yeah, I'll go...
He's here.  It's Dad.

30:57.206 --> 30:59.749
I figured I'd hear from you.

31:04.047 --> 31:05.672
You want some training?

31:07.592 --> 31:11.687
Sort of.  Not really much
else to do around here.

31:12.764 --> 31:16.051
- You like corn bread?
- Oh, I adore corn bread.

31:16.110 --> 31:19.217
Well, so does Sam,
but he'll never admit it.

31:19.218 --> 31:21.424
Because he never says anything nice.

31:21.433 --> 31:25.643
- Oh... he tries... sometimes.
- No, he doesn't.

31:30.073 --> 31:34.187
- So, you wish he would, don't you?
- You should just tell him.

31:34.995 --> 31:39.799
He doesn't get that kind of thing.
Has Kevin been around?

31:40.709 --> 31:45.195
- Ah yeah, a little bit.
- He's cute, huh?

31:46.256 --> 31:49.050
I think he thinks he's cure,
don't know if I do.

31:49.385 --> 31:53.471
Yeah well... He's got a
girlfriend, but I think he likes you.

31:53.554 --> 31:56.599
- Oh, I highly doubt that.
- Well, he asked about you the other day.

31:56.683 --> 31:59.060
Yah, just so he would
know when to avoid me.

31:59.143 --> 32:02.814
No, it was more than that.
I've seen that look before.

32:05.984 --> 32:10.406
- You're welcome, Sam.
- I know.  Thanks.

32:11.280 --> 32:14.493
I got to run.

32:16.745 --> 32:20.449
- Do you like Jody?
- Well, I like everybody.

32:20.582 --> 32:26.596
- No, I mean. Do you like Jody?
- What?

32:27.716 --> 32:30.093
She sure likes you.

32:31.928 --> 32:35.949
No, she doesn't.  She just
likes having a cheap vet.

32:39.810 --> 32:42.260
- You get those chores done?
- Yes, I did them.

32:42.270 --> 32:44.389
- All of them?
- All of them.

32:45.525 --> 32:46.942
Who is this?

32:47.526 --> 32:51.265
Wicked witch of the West.
What is she doing here?

32:54.992 --> 32:57.954
- Hey.
- Jordan!  Hey you!

33:01.040 --> 33:04.769
- Uncle Sam, this is Jordan.
- Hey, Jordan. Nice to meet you.

33:04.835 --> 33:08.281
Got something to show you.
Have fun.

33:08.674 --> 33:10.383
Yeah.

33:22.811 --> 33:26.526
- It's Sam, right?
- Yeah.

33:28.360 --> 33:33.612
- I'm Vanessa Fielding. We spoke once.
- Oh!  What did we say?

33:38.161 --> 33:41.623
- So this is Stormy.
- Cool.

33:44.611 --> 33:48.572
- Like that?
- Why can't all we just be together?

33:51.216 --> 33:55.053
- It's complicated.
- Mom's a complication, huh?

33:55.387 --> 33:57.640
Have you talked with
your brother recently?

33:57.723 --> 34:01.768
-  Yeah a couple of days ago.
- Did he tell you he's run out of money?

34:01.852 --> 34:05.397
Well, he's in jail, so it's kind
of hard to get to an ATM.

34:06.274 --> 34:09.310
No, I mean he stopped
paying child support.

34:10.203 --> 34:14.114
Huh, and you came all the way
out here, just to tell me that?

34:15.324 --> 34:19.371
Look.  Are able to help with
Mitch's obligations or not?

34:19.953 --> 34:21.351
I have been, I got Dani.

34:21.353 --> 34:25.446
No, I mean his other obligation.
Your nephew.

34:28.378 --> 34:32.175
You know, he asked me to look after
Dani.  Never mentioned anything else.

34:32.259 --> 34:37.129
I know Mitch has cash stored
in some offshore accounts.

34:37.196 --> 34:41.344
- You know that for a fact, do you?
- Oh yes, because I know Mitch.

34:42.351 --> 34:45.063
Maybe we could help
each other out here.

34:46.213 --> 34:52.105
- Can't you just be my guardian?
- I wish I could Bud.

34:53.112 --> 34:55.322
It's okay.
You're not that far away.

34:55.407 --> 34:59.202
Staying with Aunt Mildred's awful.
She's even worse than mom.

34:59.286 --> 35:01.747
- I doubt that.
- Trust me.

35:04.457 --> 35:09.179
- What does she want now?
- Come on.

35:12.008 --> 35:16.135
- Well, we just got here.
- And now we're leaving. Get in.

35:23.520 --> 35:27.731
- She's a nice lady.
- Yeah, tell me that.

35:30.902 --> 35:33.237
But don't let it get to you, okay?

35:33.487 --> 35:38.403
It's not her, it's Jordan.
She doesn't care about him.

35:40.827 --> 35:43.957
Maybe we can do
something about that.

35:46.583 --> 35:49.252
- So, when they going to need a booster?
- In a year.

35:49.379 --> 35:53.957
- Here you go, Sam.
- Thank you.  Oh, that's too much.

35:54.300 --> 35:59.130
Oh Sam, you saved War Cloud
from pneumonia, should be more.

35:59.597 --> 36:01.224
It's not necessary.

36:01.307 --> 36:04.627
Ah Sam, look.  If you
won't do it for my horse

36:04.628 --> 36:07.285
then why don't you put it
away for raising a teenager.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.231
I know what that cost.

36:11.026 --> 36:12.694
What's that?

36:13.236 --> 36:16.698
It's a poster of the regional
horse show, that is coming up.

36:16.781 --> 36:20.060
- I'll take instead.
- No Sam, take 'em both.

36:20.061 --> 36:22.204
No, the poster will do.

36:25.958 --> 36:28.961
- Good day.  See you.
- All right.

36:33.090 --> 36:36.092
- He's different.
- What do you mean?

36:36.968 --> 36:40.806
I don't know.  Always doing
stuff for everybody but himself.

36:42.206 --> 36:46.394
A kind of different we can use
more of, don't you think?  Come on.

36:50.024 --> 36:53.276
- Having fun?
- Yeah, a blast.

36:53.818 --> 36:57.948
- Why don't you try a couple of rocks.
- And do what? Beat it to death?

37:08.042 --> 37:11.044
Learned to improvise.
Savvy?

37:14.965 --> 37:18.355
I... found this.

39:00.098 --> 39:01.490
Didn't see your truck pull in.

39:01.574 --> 39:04.994
- He's riding pretty good.
- Yeah, he's doing really good.

39:05.244 --> 39:09.583
Would you like to come over to our
house some time and ride our horses?

39:10.750 --> 39:13.419
- Here for a bit?
- Yeah.

39:16.214 --> 39:20.510
You know, I think I'm gonna stay
here and work more with Stormy.

39:20.594 --> 39:24.806
There is a dance coming up in
a few weeks, Western Stomp.

39:29.645 --> 39:36.693
- Would you like to go?  With me?
- I thought you had a girlfriend.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.030
- Who told you that?
- A friend.

39:42.823 --> 39:45.827
- I've had one.
- What happened?

39:46.453 --> 39:51.049
- She didn't want me to see other people.
- Other people?

39:52.166 --> 39:54.837
I don't know, people.

39:55.878 --> 40:00.209
I don't know, I don't really
like country music very much.

40:00.550 --> 40:03.227
I'll bring ear muffs.

40:04.096 --> 40:07.891
- Okay. What should I wear?
- It's up to you.

40:09.227 --> 40:12.730
- Okay, I'll see you there.
- Right.

40:15.566 --> 40:17.142
See ya.

40:26.911 --> 40:28.663
What are you planning
on doing with her?

40:28.746 --> 40:31.874
It's a him.  Doesn't anybody
here know the difference?

40:31.957 --> 40:33.435
Yeah, well, I used to.

40:34.918 --> 40:39.090
I don't know what I'm planning on
doing with them.  It will be something.

40:40.925 --> 40:45.523
- Jody come around today?
- Maybe.

40:46.264 --> 40:48.101
You know, if you were
a little nicer to her,

40:48.102 --> 40:49.949
she might come around
a little more often.

40:50.393 --> 40:53.313
- What's that suppose to mean?
- Nothing.

40:55.230 --> 40:57.567
- You know, you're like...
- What?

40:57.650 --> 40:59.777
- Summer storm.
- A summer storm?

40:59.861 --> 41:04.240
Yeah.  You rumble a long time before
you finally get where you're going.

41:04.324 --> 41:08.995
Well, I'm going to take a ride up in the
mountains.  Let Jody know, if she comes by.

41:09.162 --> 41:13.507
- Oh what...?  So Jody is coming?
- Maybe.

41:17.588 --> 41:20.674
Yeah, she's a summer storm, alright.

41:22.509 --> 41:26.305
Diesel, why don't you go with her.
Get a little exercise.

41:28.792 --> 41:30.892
That's what I figured.

42:06.136 --> 42:11.546
I knew you were smart.
That's my boy. Let's go.

42:25.699 --> 42:28.794
Stormy, no!
Stormy, come back!

42:38.669 --> 42:41.006
Hey, you old dog.
Miss me?

42:41.964 --> 42:47.845
- No!  So you got any muffins?
- Oh, plenty.

42:50.432 --> 42:51.849
So where are they?

42:51.933 --> 42:56.588
At home.  Which is where you're gonna
have to go if you want to get some.

42:56.896 --> 42:57.940
What?  Now?

42:58.023 --> 43:01.693
Well, I thought, I'd have you and
Dani over for supper on Sunday.

43:02.277 --> 43:05.155
Well, you don't have to...
ask the girl.

43:07.491 --> 43:10.119
Why is he saddled?

43:10.453 --> 43:14.698
- Dani took him out a couple of hours ago.
- You know where she went?

43:15.232 --> 43:18.962
- Asked here only where she was going.
- Come on.

43:21.130 --> 43:23.132
Come on.  You know
where she went?  Let's go.

43:23.215 --> 43:25.760
Get on.
Do you know where she is.

43:25.844 --> 43:28.222
- Quit bossing.
- Just go.

43:42.526 --> 43:45.029
Stormy!

44:05.591 --> 44:07.219
Here she is.

44:12.807 --> 44:16.186
- What happened?
- Four wheeler on steroids came by.

44:16.811 --> 44:20.031
- Spooked him, huh?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

44:20.690 --> 44:22.984
- Thanks for the lift.
- Are you walking back?

44:23.526 --> 44:25.237
Oh, I know how.

44:26.154 --> 44:30.684
You know what, I think that I want
to drive back and check on Stormy.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.744
- Good idea.
- It is?

44:34.478 --> 44:36.706
Hey, would you like to come
for dinner on Sunday night?

44:36.789 --> 44:38.916
Yeah, we'd would love to.

44:53.723 --> 44:55.226
Well, now we're on foot.

44:55.934 --> 44:59.771
- You were gonna walk with her any way.
- Yeah, I wanted to impress her.

44:59.856 --> 45:04.093
- What am I?  Chopped liver?
- Close.  Here.

45:05.318 --> 45:06.812
You don't have to pay me,
to walk with you.

45:06.896 --> 45:11.282
- It's for her.
- You want me to walk with her?

45:11.366 --> 45:16.164
No!  She's going to some dance with
that Winslow kid.  What's his name?

45:16.330 --> 45:18.032
- Kevin.
- Yeah him.

45:18.591 --> 45:22.233
I wanted to buy her
something nice to wear.

45:22.234 --> 45:24.859
I thought you could help with that.

45:26.507 --> 45:29.803
- Sure.
- Thank you.

45:31.595 --> 45:33.689
You're welcome.

45:35.767 --> 45:37.727
What are you having?

45:37.810 --> 45:40.820
- Well, what do you mean?
- For dinner.

45:47.653 --> 45:52.208
- Hey, more pie?
- No, you have to stuff it in my pockets.

45:52.658 --> 45:54.827
- It was so good.
- Right.

45:55.369 --> 45:58.153
Hey, I'm going to the city
tomorrow to do a little shopping.

45:58.154 --> 46:00.634
- Would you like to come?
- No, too busy of a day for me.

46:00.735 --> 46:02.226
Not you.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.799
Could we maybe go to the prison?

46:06.981 --> 46:09.717
I would like to see my
dad and visit him if I could.

46:11.262 --> 46:15.765
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.  Here, I can get these.

46:17.435 --> 46:21.313
You realise the prison is an hour
south of the city to get there.

46:21.397 --> 46:26.862
So we'll leave early.
It's okay.

46:46.629 --> 46:51.627
- Hi, dad.
- Hey.

46:58.349 --> 47:03.814
- I wish you hadn't come.
- Why?

47:04.213 --> 47:08.607
I mean, it's just far.
You're wasting your time.

47:10.155 --> 47:12.080
How is it with Sam?

47:14.868 --> 47:21.340
- Well, it takes some getting used to.
- Not unlike Sam, right?

47:24.085 --> 47:29.515
They offered me a plea bargain.
Do you know what that is?

47:30.966 --> 47:32.635
Sort of.

47:34.787 --> 47:41.569
You see, if I plead guilty, it could...
reduce my sentence.  Take some time off.

47:43.313 --> 47:45.356
You haven't even gone to trial yet.

47:45.439 --> 47:51.354
No, that's why they're offering me
the plea agreement.  It avoids all that.

47:52.071 --> 47:55.074
But you're not guilty,
so don't take it.

47:55.158 --> 47:57.924
This has nothing to do
with guilt or innocence.

47:59.496 --> 48:04.175
It's all about what...
what the jury is going to believe.

48:07.170 --> 48:12.133
- What would I believe?
- That I'm guilty.

48:17.932 --> 48:21.185
So have you made any friends?

48:23.062 --> 48:30.361
- Well, I am going on a date next week.
- That's good.  He's a lucky boy.

48:32.029 --> 48:35.748
- And Jordan came by.
- I miss him.

48:35.783 --> 48:38.726
Vanessa's trying to get
money from Uncle Sam.

48:40.662 --> 48:45.972
- Dracula lady.
- She says that you have money stashed.

48:47.878 --> 48:54.726
She says a lot of things.  And it really
helps Sam isn't that bad, sweetheart.

48:56.887 --> 48:59.057
No, I think I'm getting used to it.

48:59.140 --> 49:01.355
And then when you
get past all his quirks,

49:01.356 --> 49:03.899
you'll see his heart
is in the right place.

49:04.312 --> 49:09.020
- Are you sure he has one?
- Somewhere, underneath all that crust.

49:21.538 --> 49:23.117
I'm gonna go.

49:26.043 --> 49:29.462
Okay.  I'll come back
as soon as I can...

49:29.545 --> 49:33.975
No, no.  I don't... think this
is a good place for you to come.

49:36.803 --> 49:42.267
If something changes,
I'll ask George to call you.

49:45.227 --> 49:46.271
Yeah.

49:48.900 --> 49:53.428
- I really love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

50:24.895 --> 50:27.813
- How did it go?
- Discouraging.

50:28.690 --> 50:31.192
Yeah well, prison does that.

50:35.237 --> 50:39.575
I know he's innocent, and nobody
will believe me. Not even Uncle Sam.

50:41.202 --> 50:44.946
- I wouldn't judge him too harshly now.
- They're brothers.

50:44.955 --> 50:50.537
- Yeah well, so were Cain and Abel.
- What does that mean?

50:51.546 --> 50:54.684
Well, what that
means is that sometimes

50:54.685 --> 50:57.375
things aren't as obvious
as you might think.

50:58.553 --> 51:04.156
You probably shouldn't judge him, as
much as you want him to judge your daddy.

51:10.857 --> 51:17.889
- That Kevin boy, he's pretty cute, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

51:17.907 --> 51:21.610
Yeah, well you guys are going
to the dance together, right.

51:22.453 --> 51:24.373
Yeah.  But how did you know that?

51:24.455 --> 51:27.516
Well because Sam said he wants
you to have something nice to wear.

51:28.168 --> 51:32.720
- He did?
- Yup.  He's paying for it.

51:33.964 --> 51:38.825
- Uncle Sam?
- Mm hm.  Full of surprises, huh?

51:41.305 --> 51:45.851
- Come on, let's go shopping.
- I don't know.

51:45.935 --> 51:48.213
- Good.  I know just the place.
- Okay.

51:48.296 --> 51:50.480
Move in.

52:17.718 --> 52:24.274
- Hi.
- Woh, you look amazing.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.647
Thanks.
I had help picking it out.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.614
- Hold it.
- What?

52:39.698 --> 52:42.876
- My truck.
- What's the matter with it?

52:42.909 --> 52:45.954
- It sucks.
- No, it doesn't.

52:46.788 --> 52:49.623
It's not good enough for you
to ride in, not dressed like that.

52:49.706 --> 52:53.421
- Come on, it's fine.
- Have her back here by midnight.

52:55.755 --> 52:57.299
I will.

52:58.842 --> 53:03.514
This is for little Annie.  Give her a
couple each night for the next two weeks.

53:03.597 --> 53:04.931
Okay.

53:05.099 --> 53:11.322
- And midnight for this filly.  Clear?
- Crystal.

53:22.700 --> 53:30.048
Looks pretty good, doesn't she?
Yeah.  Too good if you ask me.

53:32.710 --> 53:36.463
- Dad, you think I would do it...
- No?  Oh...

53:36.755 --> 53:38.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:38.299 --> 53:40.843
- How are your horses doing?
- Good.  Got a new one.

53:40.926 --> 53:43.512
- You want to see it?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

53:43.595 --> 53:49.853
- Come. Don't step on anything.
- Wouldn't be the first time.

53:51.479 --> 53:54.107
She may have been a competition
horse but we're not sure.

53:54.190 --> 53:59.247
With an emphasis on "we're not sure".
But I would like your opinion, though.

53:59.429 --> 54:01.355
Well, Little Annie is beautiful but,

54:01.356 --> 54:04.417
to give you an honest
opinion I'd have to ride her.

54:04.868 --> 54:07.996
- Well, maybe another day.
- No, now's great.

54:13.503 --> 54:15.420
Now it's great.

54:39.903 --> 54:44.649
She's had some training.
Not a lot but, she's sure got potential.

54:44.782 --> 54:47.995
What will it take to get
her in performance shape?

54:49.288 --> 54:52.940
Three months, at least.
I'd know more if I work with her.

54:52.942 --> 54:59.815
- It's better than riding a dang mule, huh?
- Yeah I think. It can be a pain sometimes.

54:59.899 --> 55:03.844
I don't even know why people have 'em
anymore. They're stupid, they're stubborn.

55:03.927 --> 55:06.805
Yeah, just like some people.

55:08.141 --> 55:11.186
Yeah, well you can't skin
and tan some people, huh?

55:13.646 --> 55:15.564
No you can't.

55:20.278 --> 55:24.699
- So you want to go to the dance?
- No, I want to get back on.

55:26.767 --> 55:29.095
Just afraid of that.

55:33.666 --> 55:34.868
When I get my hands on him...

55:34.903 --> 55:37.086
- You'll what?
- I'll tan his hide.

55:37.170 --> 55:39.789
Oh come on.
He'll drop you like a bag of dirt.

55:39.790 --> 55:42.175
Really?
You know, I'd like to see him try.

55:42.210 --> 55:43.565
Easy there, killer.

55:44.552 --> 55:48.096
You know, you came here to see your
niece dance in her nice new dress.

55:48.180 --> 55:50.833
So she left a little early with
a very nice young gentleman

55:50.834 --> 55:54.320
who come from a very nice family.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

55:54.405 --> 55:56.607
I'll give him the benefit
of the doubt, all right.

55:56.890 --> 56:01.169
Oh Addy Jane!
Have you seen Kevin or Dani?

56:01.487 --> 56:05.282
- No, not since school this afternoon.
- So they weren't here at all?

56:05.365 --> 56:08.409
If they were, we
didn't see them.  Sorry.

56:13.039 --> 56:14.817
You know, she could have called.

56:15.584 --> 56:18.313
With what?  You told me her cell
phone's been down for months.

56:18.397 --> 56:23.515
- Well, she should have found a way.
- How?  A carrier pigeon?

56:23.550 --> 56:28.995
- You're worse than she is.
- Now you're just an old pigeon poop.

56:29.389 --> 56:34.613
I'm not an old poop.
Or middle aged poop.

56:40.442 --> 56:44.722
- I had a lot of fun tonight.
- I'm sorry about your dress.

56:44.864 --> 56:47.324
It's okay, it's just a dress.

56:47.699 --> 56:50.488
You know a lot about
training horses, don't you?

56:51.246 --> 56:54.815
Well, a little bit.
Girls can surprise you.

56:54.850 --> 57:01.317
- Some girls maybe, not you.
- What is that suppose to mean?

57:01.352 --> 57:09.436
- Easy.  I didn't mean anything by it.
- I'm sorry. Guess I'm a little touchy.

57:09.471 --> 57:13.014
Or defensive.
Suppose you got your reasons.

57:13.049 --> 57:15.863
We didn't really get off on
the right foot anyway.

57:16.605 --> 57:18.120
No, we didn't.

57:19.066 --> 57:20.945
I'd like to make up for it.

57:23.104 --> 57:25.153
Yeah, it's alright.

57:25.188 --> 57:26.971
Late by two minutes.

57:27.199 --> 57:29.733
Yeah, I wanted to make
sure she's home in time.

57:29.734 --> 57:30.895
Mm hm.

57:32.287 --> 57:36.369
- How come you didn't go to the dance?
- You spied on me?

57:36.374 --> 57:40.122
No, no.  I wanted to see
how my investment looked.

57:44.465 --> 57:48.363
- You had a fight?
- We never left my place.

57:48.398 --> 57:52.220
I went and rode little Annie.
Mr. Winslow wanted my opinion of her

57:52.224 --> 57:54.947
and the only way to give him
an honest one was to ride her.

57:56.520 --> 58:02.248
- So Mr Winslow was there all night?
- Yeah, the whole time.

58:04.111 --> 58:09.569
- And you rode little Annie in your dress?
- Yeah, that was what I was wearing.

58:11.243 --> 58:14.205
Thank you.
I had the best time tonight.

58:14.748 --> 58:17.542
The most fun I've had the
whole time I've been here.

58:25.908 --> 58:29.658
- I suppose I owe you an apology.
- No, you don't.

58:30.580 --> 58:33.432
It was the best night in my life.

58:35.476 --> 58:40.059
Yeah, if it wasn't for my mouth,
I wouldn't have any place to put my feet.

58:47.822 --> 58:53.845
I wanna do it, Stormy.  I think
little Annie and I could really win it.

58:54.954 --> 58:59.559
But, that would mean more time
with her and less time with you.

59:01.027 --> 59:06.229
Can you be okay with that?
I love you.

59:11.347 --> 59:13.777
- Morning.
- Morning.

59:14.393 --> 59:15.559
You're up early.

59:15.643 --> 59:19.535
Yeah, felt like kind it was a pretty
daylight.  Made you breakfast.

59:22.315 --> 59:28.534
- Did you clean up in here?
- Yeah, a little bit.

59:31.366 --> 59:34.811
- There's no bacon.
- Do you want to have a heart attack?

59:35.162 --> 59:40.128
- Don't worry, I'll fix it. I'm a doctor.
- No, you're a vet.

59:40.163 --> 59:41.979
Yeah, a vet who likes bacon.

59:43.254 --> 59:47.296
So Kevin's dad asked
me to train little Annie.

59:49.093 --> 59:54.189
- Really? You up to it?
- Yeah. I think I know what I'm doing.

59:54.389 --> 59:57.851
I wish I did.  What about
your chores around here?

59:57.976 --> 01:00:01.383
Well, I was kind of hoping maybe
you could help me out with them.

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.660
Just until I'm done
training little Annie.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:06.559
I mean, I barely have time
to get her in shape as it is.

01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:13.430
- What about Stormy?
- Stormy, she'll be fine.

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:18.289
Well maybe.  She's kind of getting used
to you spending a lot of time with her.

01:00:18.373 --> 01:00:21.459
Yeah.
You know what ** me.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:26.938
- Okay.
- Uh, there's something else.

01:00:27.714 --> 01:00:29.174
What's that?

01:00:29.342 --> 01:00:30.968
I really like that dress,

01:00:31.511 --> 01:00:34.442
but I think daddy wanted me to
use the money for something else.

01:00:34.889 --> 01:00:36.333
What money?

01:00:38.143 --> 01:00:41.720
The money that I gave you,
the first time I was here.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.230
Yeah yeah, right.

01:00:48.529 --> 01:00:51.546
Here you go.
Do whatever you want with it.

01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:59.961
- You haven't opened it.
- Why would I do that? It's not mine.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:04.215
Look, I just thought that you
would have used the money to...

01:01:04.217 --> 01:01:05.754
About what?

01:01:09.174 --> 01:01:11.511
It's Kevin.

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:19.700
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

01:01:19.769 --> 01:01:23.006
Because I thought, that
you use the money to...

01:01:24.564 --> 01:01:26.471
You better not keep him waiting.

01:01:35.701 --> 01:01:36.950
She likes training their horse

01:01:36.953 --> 01:01:41.374
but that's not the only thing she
likes slow at the Winslow and **.

01:01:43.418 --> 01:01:48.513
Yeah, you said it.  What, teenage
girls must drive their fathers crazy.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:53.317
Really wish I had some bacon.

01:03:00.872 --> 01:03:03.818
You know, maybe you can
try a little chicken or steak.

01:03:04.353 --> 01:03:08.808
You know, something different.
You don't have to eat it.

01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:12.611
You better get it from
the store and I'll fix it.

01:03:12.612 --> 01:03:13.886
Okay.

01:03:16.996 --> 01:03:22.421
- Has he been fed?
- Yeah, but I'm not you.

01:03:23.727 --> 01:03:27.810
- What do you mean?
- He's lonely.

01:03:28.232 --> 01:03:33.019
- He's a mule.
- Mules have feelings.

01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:53.884
Alright darling, come on out.

01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:03.053
- You going somewhere?
- Yes, and he can't come with me.

01:04:04.728 --> 01:04:08.607
- So you brought him here?
- Yes, well, you're his uncle.

01:04:08.642 --> 01:04:10.862
Well, you're his mother.
You outrank me.

01:04:10.863 --> 01:04:13.547
I can't take him with me.

01:04:15.447 --> 01:04:20.039
- You asked what he wants?
- This is best for everyone.

01:04:20.074 --> 01:04:25.133
Yeah sure. You... don't you
even want to say goodbye to him?

01:04:25.248 --> 01:04:27.195
Oh, I did already.

01:04:40.932 --> 01:04:43.359
Well, I guess you could
help me with some chores.

01:04:44.143 --> 01:04:47.289
- See you can get Stormy to eat.
- What's the matter with him?

01:04:47.324 --> 01:04:52.335
Well, he's off his feed.
I think that he's... lonely.

01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:56.873
Should get you settled
in first, though uh?

01:04:57.907 --> 01:05:00.150
You don't seem too
upset that she's leaving.

01:05:00.477 --> 01:05:04.095
- She's always running away.
- That's a good point.

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:05.642
- Where's Dani?
- She ran away.

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:06.792
Sure?

01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:11.383
No, no.  She's working
with a filly down the road.

01:05:11.784 --> 01:05:13.031
Come on.

01:05:14.758 --> 01:05:17.408
You think my Mom went
too far, don't you?

01:05:17.637 --> 01:05:20.870
Yup, and I hope she stays there.

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:30.200
- You know my sister is coming next week.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

01:05:30.307 --> 01:05:32.392
I was hoping you could
help me with the kid.

01:05:33.026 --> 01:05:37.086
- You need to get to know him better.
- This kid used to be the first one.

01:05:37.404 --> 01:05:39.811
Well, take him with you.
It will be good for the both of you.

01:05:40.012 --> 01:05:42.360
I'll come back around this afternoon.

01:05:42.619 --> 01:05:45.476
- You promise?
- Scout's honor.

01:05:45.998 --> 01:05:50.450
- You're not a Scout.
- I'm not an uncle either.

01:06:06.935 --> 01:06:08.063
Howdy.

01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:11.041
Good morning, Sam. Who is this?
Your new assistant?

01:06:11.076 --> 01:06:13.197
- Yup.
- I'm Dani's little brother.

01:06:13.232 --> 01:06:16.174
- Well, hello there, Dani's little brother.
- Hi.

01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:17.711
- Dani's over the other corral.
- Cool.

01:06:17.746 --> 01:06:20.000
- Go on.
- Good kid.

01:06:20.075 --> 01:06:23.057
Hey, thanks for coming out this morning.
Can I talk to you about something?

01:06:23.092 --> 01:06:24.368
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:06:33.378 --> 01:06:34.620
Hey, Dani!

01:06:39.603 --> 01:06:41.006
Hey kiddo!

01:06:41.346 --> 01:06:44.588
- Hey, you said you miss me.
- Of course, I missed you.

01:06:44.682 --> 01:06:47.935
- Who is this?
- This is Little Annie.

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.947
- I've been working with her.
- What about Stormy?

01:06:51.939 --> 01:06:54.608
Well, this is kind of more like
the stuff I used to do with Admiral.

01:06:54.692 --> 01:06:57.539
- Cool.
- Come on, Bud.

01:06:58.906 --> 01:07:00.779
She's spending a lot of time here.

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.022
Yeah, well the event's
coming up soon, Doc.

01:07:03.494 --> 01:07:05.087
I just don't get to see her that much.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.080
Now look, I'm not trying
to keep her from you.

01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:08.268
Oh, I know that.

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:11.547
Ah, it's the competition.
I need that filly to do well.

01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:14.067
And Dani is doing
a great job with her.

01:07:14.115 --> 01:07:17.115
Yeah, I get it, you know.
She's got her heart set on this, so...

01:07:19.176 --> 01:07:21.178
I missed you!

01:07:21.719 --> 01:07:25.723
Hey.  Vanessa came by and
dropped him off this morning.

01:07:25.807 --> 01:07:29.153
- So, he's staying?
- Well, for a while.

01:07:31.897 --> 01:07:34.744
Hey, I forgot to show you this.

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:42.407
What?  Are you serious?
I knew Brooke was going to ruin him!

01:07:43.409 --> 01:07:45.490
Who is she?
What do you mean, ruin him?

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:47.999
Just nothing okay.
Just forget it.

01:07:50.249 --> 01:07:55.192
- How could you hate her so much?
- I... I don't hate her.

01:07:55.227 --> 01:07:59.783
- You don't like her very much either.
- Well, you know, tendinitis does happen.

01:07:59.883 --> 01:08:03.492
Yeah, but ...
I worked so hard with him.

01:08:03.527 --> 01:08:07.490
Well then, make sure Little Annie
shows everyone how it should be done.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:10.788
Hey, I have an idea.
Maybe you could ride Stormy.

01:08:11.729 --> 01:08:16.399
- Stormy is a mule, Jordan.
- I thought you liked her.

01:08:16.984 --> 01:08:20.421
Him and I do but...
He's not a horse.

01:08:20.787 --> 01:08:25.031
- You got that one right.
- Is that why you said he won't eat?

01:08:26.828 --> 01:08:28.719
- Did I say that?
- Yeah.

01:08:28.746 --> 01:08:30.216
He's not eating?

01:08:31.957 --> 01:08:34.658
You know what?  Jordan
and I have a lot of work to do.

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.728
Back at the...
I don't know.

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:55.206
So, what do you
think your chances are?

01:08:56.776 --> 01:09:00.718
- I don't know.
- Horse show is not that far off, you know?

01:09:00.752 --> 01:09:06.856
- I know that.  That's what worries me.
- Don't worry.  You'll be great.

01:09:07.953 --> 01:09:11.908
Thanks.  But I kind of need
more than you just saying that.

01:09:13.234 --> 01:09:14.915
Maybe I can be more.

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:19.913
Who's Brooke?

01:09:21.843 --> 01:09:25.081
Just the girl who ruin
my horse and my life.

01:09:26.532 --> 01:09:30.529
Oh, glad I asked.

01:09:38.801 --> 01:09:40.836
Stupid mule.

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:50.513
It's no use.
He won't eat.

01:09:52.165 --> 01:09:55.091
Doesn't mean we can't.
What do you want for supper?

01:09:55.919 --> 01:09:59.440
- What have you got?
- A lot of vegetables.

01:09:59.798 --> 01:10:03.915
- Anything good?
- And you ain't a vegetarian?

01:10:04.094 --> 01:10:10.245
- No, I'm an American.
- Me too. How about one of this?

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.961
Yeah.

01:10:13.311 --> 01:10:17.314
I've been trying to convert the
wrong ones. Set the table, here, son.

01:10:37.169 --> 01:10:42.907
- He wanted to wait up for you.
- He didn't make it.

01:10:48.348 --> 01:10:55.733
You know, he's all I have left.
Rather than you.

01:10:56.605 --> 01:11:02.951
He's a good worker.  So how's
the training going for Little Annie?

01:11:04.696 --> 01:11:09.143
It's good.  Only 10 days
to the competition.

01:11:13.539 --> 01:11:15.459
Who is Brooke?

01:11:20.505 --> 01:11:23.462
Her mom is the one
that bought Admiral.

01:11:25.342 --> 01:11:31.182
- You don't like her.
- It's not that I don't like her. She just...

01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:36.464
- You blame her for your problems.
- You have no right to say that.

01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:39.344
- Okay.
- It is my life.

01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:46.822
It's not your life I was commenting on.
It's the way you're living it.

01:12:01.005 --> 01:12:06.366
- Maybe he forgot who you are.
- He didn't forget, he's just mad.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.323
- Do mules get mad?
- This one does.

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:15.587
Nope, nope come on.

01:12:16.227 --> 01:12:18.567
Oh, Stormy.

01:12:20.275 --> 01:12:23.273
Sam, do me a favor.
Don't listen to her.

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.603
You know, you should
keep your kids together.

01:12:27.604 --> 01:12:30.182
It's a little more
complicated than that.

01:12:30.492 --> 01:12:33.180
You need to think of someone
else beside yourself, Mitch.

01:12:33.183 --> 01:12:34.685
You had a real hard time with that.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.350
Even when we were kids, you were
great at taking but lousy at giving.

01:12:39.793 --> 01:12:43.161
Listen to me.
Alright?

01:12:43.662 --> 01:12:47.171
Even if there was money,

01:12:47.343 --> 01:12:51.846
if I told them about it, they would
add at least five years to my sentence.

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.802
Do you understand that?
Minimum!

01:12:55.977 --> 01:13:00.816
Look, if you don't do something,
you might even lose them both.

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:07.661
- I have already lost them, Sam.
- No, no, you just let them down.

01:13:07.696 --> 01:13:12.457
You just... Look, I really don't
have time for this, alright?

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:14.898
It's your choice, little brother.

01:13:26.465 --> 01:13:28.958
Good. Left leg, left leg.
You must cut in.

01:13:29.359 --> 01:13:33.795
Terrific.  The leg. It's coming in,
coming in.  Good, good.

01:13:33.991 --> 01:13:36.801
Hey, you riding pretty
good there, little man.

01:13:36.836 --> 01:13:38.098
Thanks.

01:13:40.072 --> 01:13:41.316
Is Doc around?

01:13:41.423 --> 01:13:45.133
Uh no.  He went into town
but he'll be back later.

01:13:45.168 --> 01:13:46.254
Alright.
Just have him call.

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.000
Dad's flying to go look at some
new stock over at Grand Junction.

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:52.540
- He want the Doc to go with him.
- Do you have an airport around here?

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:56.246
Yeah, a small one.
My dad keeps his plane there.

01:13:56.329 --> 01:13:59.282
Your dad has a plane?  Can I fly in it?

01:13:59.283 --> 01:14:01.603
Hey, you don't just ask like that.

01:14:01.628 --> 01:14:03.963
Yeah, you could probably
go with dad and Doc.

01:14:04.047 --> 01:14:07.100
- Really?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

01:14:07.102 --> 01:14:10.048
- When?
- Tomorrow. Just remind him ok, Buddy?

01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:11.318
Yeah.

01:14:12.096 --> 01:14:15.543
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Don't mention it.

01:14:18.543 --> 01:14:20.537
Looks like there's a storm coming.

01:14:24.441 --> 01:14:27.053
- Who said it was okay?
- Kevin did.

01:14:28.946 --> 01:14:30.991
- You wanna go?
- Do I?

01:14:31.074 --> 01:14:34.216
- I don't know. Do you?
- Yes, I do.

01:14:47.298 --> 01:14:48.885
What?

01:14:49.759 --> 01:14:55.344
- Vanessa called.
- She want more money?

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.674
Jordan.

01:15:01.469 --> 01:15:03.645
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing.

01:15:04.679 --> 01:15:07.351
Look, she still has legal custody.

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:11.945
And I asked Mitch if he has any
money offshore like she claims.

01:15:13.659 --> 01:15:16.204
- What did he say?
- He didn't.

01:15:17.203 --> 01:15:21.298
- But you think he does, don't you?
- It doesn't matter what I think.

01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:27.597
He's been sentenced.

01:15:30.634 --> 01:15:37.711
- Nobody told me that. How long?
- Five to ten.

01:15:37.846 --> 01:15:39.559
Years?

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:51.876
So, does this mean
we can't go tomorrow?

01:15:54.242 --> 01:15:59.213
- I think we can still make that work out.
- Yeah!

01:16:50.298 --> 01:16:55.553
- I hope they got out before this hit.
- Jordan said that they could fly over it.

01:16:55.886 --> 01:17:00.451
Plane's missing.  The Sheriff got
the Mayday call about an hour ago.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.124
- I'm gonna go see if I can find them.
- Where?

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:07.357
Birchwood Springs.  He said to gather
as many people as you can to go search.

01:17:07.441 --> 01:17:10.111
- I'll see who I can get.
- I'm coming with you.

01:17:10.194 --> 01:17:14.580
- You can't, I only have one horse.
- What about Little Annie?

01:17:14.741 --> 01:17:17.284
There's no way she'd
make it up that mountain.

01:17:18.911 --> 01:17:20.620
Stormy.

01:17:22.331 --> 01:17:26.460
From the last transmission there
in the Rogers Beau area here,

01:17:26.544 --> 01:17:30.901
I think if we start at the base, we circle
both ways, we might just get lucky.

01:17:31.548 --> 01:17:33.759
Okay, then let's meet on
the east side of the Beau.

01:17:33.842 --> 01:17:37.270
Okay.  I'll set up base at
the Birch Springs campground.

01:17:37.305 --> 01:17:39.357
Here, take this, use Channel 4.
Let's go.

01:17:39.374 --> 01:17:41.510
- Good luck.
- We'll find them.

01:17:43.853 --> 01:17:45.813
Come on, buddy.

01:17:49.566 --> 01:17:55.918
Come on.  Stormy, stop.
What's the matter with you?  Come on.

01:18:01.186 --> 01:18:09.172
Look.  I know I haven't been there for
you and I'm sorry, okay?   It was wrong.

01:18:10.213 --> 01:18:13.854
But I really need you right now.
Okay?

01:18:14.135 --> 01:18:20.046
Jordan and Uncle Sam, they're lost
and they might be hurt really bad.

01:18:20.639 --> 01:18:27.912
And I can't do this without you, ok?
I really need you.  Please do it for me.

01:18:29.483 --> 01:18:31.072
I love you.

01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:40.579
Kevin?
Kevin, can you hear me?

01:19:42.764 --> 01:19:45.010
Kevin? Sheriff? Anyone?

01:19:48.813 --> 01:19:51.129
God help me,
before it's too late.

01:20:25.058 --> 01:20:26.260
Cameron?

01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:31.522
- He can't hear you. He's unconscious.
- I'm not unconscious.

01:20:31.607 --> 01:20:34.149
- Jordan?
- I'm just resting my eyes.

01:20:34.402 --> 01:20:39.444
- Yeah well, just rest them some more.
- Uncle Sam, are you hurt?

01:20:39.916 --> 01:20:41.832
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.

01:20:43.786 --> 01:20:46.039
We got to get these two
down the mountain right away.

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:49.427
- I'm sorry.
- I can't move my leg.

01:20:49.542 --> 01:20:53.624
Okay.  Don't move it, just lie
back down.  What about you?

01:20:54.797 --> 01:20:58.179
- It's nothing.
- That is not like nothing.

01:20:58.214 --> 01:20:59.674
Don't worry about it.
Come here.

01:21:02.013 --> 01:21:04.291
I think that Cameron
is hemorrhaging internally.

01:21:04.433 --> 01:21:08.083
He is going to die if we don't give
him some help.  Is that thing working?

01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:09.888
No, all I'm getting is static.

01:21:10.756 --> 01:21:14.782
I think the mountain's cutting reception.
Up there, Elk Ridge Summit.

01:21:14.942 --> 01:21:16.839
When you raise them,
they'll know where it is.

01:21:17.777 --> 01:21:19.976
- But you...
- Just go.  I'll be here when you get back.

01:21:25.453 --> 01:21:28.829
Alright buddy.
Hang in there, okay?

01:21:39.092 --> 01:21:40.633
Just a little further, boy.

01:21:44.681 --> 01:21:48.435
Sheriff? Kevin?
Anyone?

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:53.982
They can't hear me.

01:21:56.485 --> 01:22:00.463
Kevin?
Please, somebody answer me.

01:22:00.823 --> 01:22:04.348
<i>Sheriff's down the other side,
but I hear you.  Where are you?</i>

01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:07.984
Jody? Jody, it's me.
The plane's just below Elk Ridge Summit.

01:22:08.205 --> 01:22:10.416
<i>Copy that. I'll send
Kevin and the search party.</i>

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:14.026
Please hurry.  Cameron Winslow has
internal injuries and he's bleeding in,

01:22:14.027 --> 01:22:16.113
and Jordan and Sam
both have broken bones.

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:19.591
<i>Didn't get all that, but somebody will
be there in about an hour, maybe less.</i>

01:22:19.674 --> 01:22:21.386
<i>You just get over the hill.
Down and out.</i>

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:26.299
Thank you.
They're coming.

01:22:39.362 --> 01:22:41.489
- Any luck?
- Yeah, I got them.

01:22:41.572 --> 01:22:44.577
- How long?
- About an hour.

01:22:44.784 --> 01:22:48.789
Okay.  We need to tie these ropes
together, so Stormy can pull.

01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:55.326
- Wow.  Not bad for a one-armed man.
- That's what all the girls say.

01:22:55.712 --> 01:22:59.358
- Dani, it hurts.
- Okay, don't lean on it.

01:23:00.926 --> 01:23:04.127
That is the ugliest
horse I've ever seen.

01:23:04.128 --> 01:23:06.918
Well, that horse is
going to save your life.

01:23:09.435 --> 01:23:12.937
Come on, boy.  Put your
leg in there. There you go.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:14.816
One, two...

01:23:18.985 --> 01:23:22.138
Bring him over here.
We'll meet them down the mountain.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.251
Here he comes.

01:24:16.126 --> 01:24:21.706
- Hey! He's hurt pretty bad.
- How did I get here?

01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:25.533
- Stormy brought you.
- That's not a horse.

01:24:26.388 --> 01:24:29.510
- Where are the others?
- They couldn't make it through.

01:24:32.277 --> 01:24:33.932
Well, we have to.

01:24:33.967 --> 01:24:36.647
I'll put him on my horse
and ride behind you.

01:24:36.731 --> 01:24:39.442
Just don't let him
bounce around too much.

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:47.692
I was wrong.

01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:51.572
- About what?
- Mules.

01:24:53.098 --> 01:24:56.446
Well, I think the mule
feels the same way.

01:24:58.047 --> 01:24:59.059
Yeah.

01:25:01.799 --> 01:25:03.798
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:25:06.929 --> 01:25:10.432
The radios work better down below.
I'll call you.

01:25:17.731 --> 01:25:24.454
- You look worse than what you say.
- Yeah, I think I might have broken a rib.

01:25:24.821 --> 01:25:29.750
- Getting hard to catch my breathe.
- Can you ride, if I carry Jordan?

01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:34.581
No!  You take him.  I'll stay here,
I'll be okay.  They'll be back up for me.

01:25:37.586 --> 01:25:39.169
Stormy!

01:25:40.504 --> 01:25:43.173
Dani.  No!  No!
Let him go!

01:25:43.508 --> 01:25:45.259
Stormy!

01:25:51.015 --> 01:25:55.186
- But the wolves are gonna get him.
- Dani let him go, ok.  He's on his own.

01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:58.002
These wolves are everywhere, ok.
We...

01:25:58.003 --> 01:26:00.568
It's going to be dark soon.
We need to build a fire.

01:26:01.502 --> 01:26:06.028
- Do you have any matches?
- No.

01:26:08.617 --> 01:26:11.785
I can get a fire without matches.

01:26:17.566 --> 01:26:21.627
- You have a good fire, buddy.
- Thanks.

01:26:24.424 --> 01:26:28.117
- My leg hurts.
- Alright, try not to move it.

01:26:28.152 --> 01:26:32.591
- What if the wolf comes?
- Well, don't let him know we're here.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.066
The wolf's right there!

01:26:50.451 --> 01:26:54.041
That worked.
Probably won't work again though.

01:26:54.496 --> 01:26:57.114
Just keep doing it.
At least it worked for now.

01:27:00.878 --> 01:27:03.820
Uncle Sam?
You gotta stay awake.

01:27:03.821 --> 01:27:05.222
Enough.

01:27:05.842 --> 01:27:07.967
Dani, it's been a long day.

01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:17.043
Stormy, where are you?

01:27:23.509 --> 01:27:28.253
He's coming back.
Uncle Sam?

01:27:46.924 --> 01:27:48.617
Uncle Sam!

01:28:03.817 --> 01:28:05.337
Stay back!

01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:24.967
Stormy!
You came back.

01:28:29.134 --> 01:28:33.305
He brought me here.  He found me
down below and then took off again.

01:28:33.389 --> 01:28:37.413
I figured he was trying to tell
me something.  Are you okay?

01:28:38.185 --> 01:28:42.582
One time I wished you'd
shown up early and you're late.

01:28:45.818 --> 01:28:49.385
As soon as I get him to
the Sheriff's camp, I'll be back.

01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:05.946
- Are we there yet?
- Almost, buddy.  Hang on.

01:29:14.178 --> 01:29:17.767
Cameron's gonna make it.
Just came over the radio.

01:29:17.851 --> 01:29:21.922
- Will you be able to get back on your own?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

01:29:22.396 --> 01:29:25.907
It's a great little mule.
You trained him?

01:29:27.318 --> 01:29:33.892
No, more like he trained me.
Thank you.

01:29:37.704 --> 01:29:40.047
Let's go home, Stormy.

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:48.305
- Thanks for helping me, bud.
- Are you gonna fix up Stormy too?

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.013
I already did.

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:52.387
- You want to do me a favor?
- Yeah.

01:29:52.469 --> 01:29:54.045
You want to get him and tie
him on the fence up there?

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.104
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:03.772
Okay little girl.
Are you ready?

01:30:05.074 --> 01:30:08.172
Okay, come on.
Come on.

01:30:20.522 --> 01:30:24.302
- Did you tell 'em?
- No, I did not.

01:30:25.235 --> 01:30:28.997
You know, we gonna go make
some supper.  Nice to meet you.

01:30:30.716 --> 01:30:35.609
- What's going on?
- I heard about Admiral.

01:30:36.805 --> 01:30:41.532
- There's nothing we could have done.
- Yeah, I know.

01:30:42.144 --> 01:30:46.640
- We worked so hard too.
- Yeah.

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:49.553
Well, your new horse, she's beautiful.

01:30:50.696 --> 01:30:57.085
Well, I trained her...
but I think you should ride her.

01:30:58.452 --> 01:31:00.596
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:04.100
I already talked to the show committee and
they're fine with you riding in my place.

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:07.504
I think you got a real good
shot at winning that trophy.

01:31:07.838 --> 01:31:11.466
- But why are you...?
- Because I've already got my mount.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:15.637
A mule?

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:22.577
Yeah, I... I'm going to be a trainer from
now on.  So do good, I need the exposure.

01:31:23.062 --> 01:31:29.377
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't need to say anything.  I do.

01:31:35.641 --> 01:31:40.837
I'm really sorry, for the way that
I treated you the last few years.

01:31:41.205 --> 01:31:47.294
I just... It's about all my problem
on you and I'm really sorry.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:54.401
I know that it isn't enough,
but I hope it's a start.

01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:58.515
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for us.

01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:05.266
Thank you, Dani.
From both of us.

01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:12.052
Thanks for giving me a second chance.
Well, you better get going.

01:32:16.616 --> 01:32:18.846
I won't forget this.

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:30.554
Go win it.  And don't forget
to tell who your trainer is.

01:32:35.577 --> 01:32:38.160
Don't break any
of those, only ones I got.

01:32:38.163 --> 01:32:42.454
- These are brand new.
- Well, I didn't say I used them a lot.

01:32:43.309 --> 01:32:46.356
- Funny how things change.
- 'Hey, my birthday is coming.

01:32:46.439 --> 01:32:48.147
Oh really?
When is it?

01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:51.152
In a month.
I was maybe thinking I could...

01:32:52.569 --> 01:32:54.864
Just hold that Jordan.

01:32:56.656 --> 01:33:03.406
Hello?  What?
You mean now?

01:33:06.917 --> 01:33:08.065
Okay.

01:33:09.044 --> 01:33:11.921
- Who was that?
- His mother.

01:33:13.549 --> 01:33:18.260
She's coming for the boy.  She got
papers from the district court.

01:33:18.763 --> 01:33:20.388
No!

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:26.759
- Why don't you just tell her no?
- Go help your brother pack.

01:33:34.195 --> 01:33:38.934
- Hey, somebody's here.
- What?  She called from a block away?

01:33:39.943 --> 01:33:43.621
It's Jordan's mother.
See if you can get him on the phone.

01:33:43.705 --> 01:33:45.686
Yeah, I will.

01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:51.104
There's only one person
who can change her mind now.

01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:02.499
I would like to get back to
civilization before the year ends.

01:34:02.534 --> 01:34:04.150
You know what you
doing to him, don't you?

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.708
- Mitch?  I hope he's squirming.
-  Jordan.

01:34:09.063 --> 01:34:12.160
That is not my fault.
If Mitch had just...

01:34:12.166 --> 01:34:15.738
If Mitch had dumped you two years ago,
this wouldn't be a problem now, would it?

01:34:16.571 --> 01:34:19.724
- No need to get nasty.
- Why not?  I'm talking to a pro.

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:32.858
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I can.

01:34:39.929 --> 01:34:42.805
We'll get you back.
I promise.

01:34:43.057 --> 01:34:46.753
I mean, what can you do?
What can anybody do?

01:34:52.024 --> 01:34:54.395
So you're sure you
won't change your mind?

01:34:55.194 --> 01:35:00.473
- I would.  For a price.
- Wait!

01:35:04.287 --> 01:35:10.142
This is Vanessa.  You sure?
You can verify that?

01:35:10.959 --> 01:35:14.171
Oh, I'll be there.
But let's be perfectly clear on this.

01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:22.309
9 am tomorrow morning.
Oh, I'll take him.  Fine.

01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:27.839
- Sweetheart, get out.
- What?

01:35:27.977 --> 01:35:32.771
- Oh honey, you're not coming.
- Come here, you.

01:35:40.073 --> 01:35:41.907
Bye bye.

01:35:53.503 --> 01:35:58.344
- Who did you call?
- Your father's lawyer.

01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:59.885
What did he do?

01:36:00.219 --> 01:36:06.015
Nothing, but... we thought he would
reveal some hidden assets to the court.

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.644
You mean sign them over to the
wicked witch of the west there.

01:36:11.271 --> 01:36:16.684
In order for her to get the money, she
has to sign legal custody over to Sam.

01:36:22.615 --> 01:36:24.638
Come on, it's not that big a tale.

01:36:24.639 --> 01:36:27.959
So there's something to
show you over here.  Come on.

01:36:31.541 --> 01:36:36.505
- Your father, he did the right thing.
- But how did you...

01:36:36.588 --> 01:36:40.718
Well, he told me about his hidden assets.
Because he was right about that.

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.804
But from the bail I get
drawing away from her,

01:36:43.887 --> 01:36:45.481
he had to give up
more than just money.

01:36:45.516 --> 01:36:47.058
What?

01:36:48.184 --> 01:36:51.270
They added three years
on to his sentence.

01:36:54.741 --> 01:37:01.159
- So, I'm staying here?
- Yeah, you're staying here.

01:37:02.866 --> 01:37:06.952
You know, I just remembered that
I do have something for your birthday.

01:37:07.036 --> 01:37:08.771
His birthday is not for another month.

01:37:08.855 --> 01:37:12.249
So who says you only get
presents on your birthday?

01:37:12.959 --> 01:37:16.294
Cool!

01:37:16.378 --> 01:37:19.089
- Look at that.
- Don't cut yourself.

01:37:19.548 --> 01:37:22.969
And someone told me that
I'm a vet not a doctor.

01:37:27.806 --> 01:37:29.977
This is for you.

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:34.831
- Here.
- What?  It's not my birthday.

01:37:34.897 --> 01:37:36.892
Oh, just open it.

01:37:45.866 --> 01:37:49.287
I... Look I would have
gotten down on one knee,

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:52.856
now then I'd have to get all
the way back up again and then...

01:37:53.457 --> 01:37:58.419
- So will you..?
- Yes!

01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:08.522
Hey, there's something
you guys should know.

01:38:08.923 --> 01:38:09.962
What?

01:38:09.997 --> 01:38:11.576
Little Annie won.

01:38:12.677 --> 01:38:15.143
Looks like you're going to be
training horses from now on.

01:38:15.178 --> 01:38:16.614
She won!

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:25.198
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

01:38:25.867 --> 01:38:32.022
How I acted.  And...
I'd like to make it up to you.

01:38:32.498 --> 01:38:35.201
- Oh really?
- Mm hm.
