WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.221
-Previously on Empire...
-Please marry me. I love you.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.190
-I love you.
-I'm gonna help you
get out of here, Quincy.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.492
QUINCY: Trust Andre.
If he says he can help, he will.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.894
Lyon Family Management
is looking

00:26.927 --> 00:28.696
for artists
that got something to say.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.264
PORSHA:
We did find a star.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.433
Your followers
and your impressions are way up.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.667
What's this bruise?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.169
CANDACE:
Things just got a little rowdy

00:35.203 --> 00:36.437
in spin class, that's all.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.871
KINGSLEY:
The data shows that TBD

00:37.905 --> 00:39.407
can never make
as much as they cost.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.941
I am dropping them.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.876
-We have a proposition for you.
-"We"?

00:42.910 --> 00:44.945
Hey, Lucious.

00:46.980 --> 00:50.618
* Oh... *

00:50.651 --> 00:53.621
* Uh... *

00:53.654 --> 00:57.391
* I've been on it,
I've been on my grind *

00:57.425 --> 00:59.360
* Moving solo

00:59.393 --> 01:04.232
* I've been away,
but now you want my time *

01:04.265 --> 01:05.566
* Wouldn't you know

01:05.599 --> 01:08.469
* I'm a one-a-day woman,
I'm pulling up *

01:08.502 --> 01:09.937
* Ain't got the time,
I wasted enough *

01:09.970 --> 01:11.572
* Hundreds on hundreds
I'm stacking up *

01:11.605 --> 01:13.641
* Did it on my own

01:13.674 --> 01:17.878
* If you ain't with me,
then you in my way *

01:17.911 --> 01:19.280
* Just letting you know

01:19.313 --> 01:20.581
* You want my spot

01:20.614 --> 01:24.652
* But know you ain't no factor

01:24.685 --> 01:26.420
* You ain't no factor *

01:26.454 --> 01:29.157
* Like it or not, I'm winning

01:29.190 --> 01:32.460
-* So it don't matter
-* It don't matter *

01:32.493 --> 01:34.061
* Oh, yeah

01:34.094 --> 01:37.131
* Look what you've done,
gone and turned me to a savage *

01:37.165 --> 01:40.601
* You know, you know,
gotta get it, gotta have it *

01:40.634 --> 01:42.603
* With all the smoke
keeping lit *

01:42.636 --> 01:45.973
* I'm doing damage, oh

01:46.006 --> 01:48.776
-(vocalizes)
-* Look what you've done

01:48.809 --> 01:50.578
* Gone and turned me
to a savage *

01:50.611 --> 01:54.315
* Comin' for the bags,
bet I make out like a bandit *

01:54.348 --> 01:57.185
* With all the smoke,
when I roll up doing damage *

01:57.218 --> 02:00.521
* Oh, don't say
I didn't tell ya. *

02:00.554 --> 02:03.291
-(whooping)
-(Lucious chuckling)

02:03.324 --> 02:05.159
Looks like the Divas got a hit.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.361
-No.
-What you mean, no?

02:07.395 --> 02:09.029
KINGSLEY:
The Divas thought that working

02:09.062 --> 02:11.465
with Cookie and Lucious would,
uh, keep them on the label?

02:11.499 --> 02:13.267
Nice try.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.336
-That song is fire.
-It's irrelevant.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.206
Since when, Jeff?
There's a deal to be made here.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.775
Let's talk about this upstairs.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.444
Yeah, excuse me, hello?

02:23.477 --> 02:24.778
Y'all not gonna talk

02:24.812 --> 02:26.447
about the future of our group
without us.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.649
I'll meet y'all in the elevator.

02:32.386 --> 02:35.155
(door opens)

02:35.189 --> 02:37.157
LUCIOUS: Listen, Jeff,
we're going to put together

02:37.191 --> 02:40.528
an upcoming showcase
for our clients.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.996
Now, we want to headline that
with the Divas

02:43.030 --> 02:44.998
and this new song,
so we're gonna need

02:45.032 --> 02:46.967
some money for promotion
for this.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.502
That sounds like your problem.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.971
You don't want to make money?
Do you understand

02:51.004 --> 02:52.340
how this industry works?

02:52.373 --> 02:53.741
Jeff, Empire usually shares

02:53.774 --> 02:55.476
the promotional cost
with artist management.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.910
No, Empire used to share
those costs.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.850
(sighs) We signed with Lucious
because he has a track record

03:02.883 --> 03:06.420
of making hits for us. I mean,
we're worth the investment.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.556
I determine the worth
of my investment.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.924
You know what, if you don't want
to invest in them,

03:10.958 --> 03:12.526
why don't you let them go,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.662
and we'll take them
someplace else.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.664
I don't know if you're trying to
start a pissing contest with me,

03:16.697 --> 03:18.098
but don't. You'll lose.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.534
-You sure about that?
-No. Lucious.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.103
He's beneath us. Let's go.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.940
This whole damn place
is beneath me. Come on.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.946
* How you look so precious

03:32.980 --> 03:36.183
* When you smile

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
HAKEEM:
Y'all getting so big.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.687
What you doing, little man?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.689
TIANA:
Yeah, you missed a lot

03:41.722 --> 03:44.057
since you were too busy posting
diss tracks against Blake.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.428
He's a thief.
Did you forget that?

03:47.461 --> 03:49.563
Doesn't matter. That wasn't
the way to handle it.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.433
Babe, I don't get no credit

03:52.466 --> 03:55.035
for taking the song down? Here.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.204
No, you don't get credit
for undoing

03:57.237 --> 04:00.140
something that you shouldn't
have done in the first place.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.277
-Oh. So you on his side?
-No.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.245
I haven't even talked to him.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.985
Look, I'm glad
that you took it down.

04:12.019 --> 04:16.524
And I'm glad that you are
taking care of yourself lately.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.731
Look, um, maybe you should take
the kids for a couple days.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.300
Really? You serious?

04:26.334 --> 04:29.102
Just please make sure that Bella
stays on her schedule.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.839
I don't want to be up with her
at 2:00 a.m. next week.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.444
A'ight. Come on, little man.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.946
My little fighter right here.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.315
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay, bye.

04:41.349 --> 04:44.151
Gonna go with Daddy? Yeah?

04:44.184 --> 04:45.586
* I just gotta say.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.087
-Hey, babe.
-JAMAL: Mm-hmm.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.522
You got cash for the pizza guy?

04:48.556 --> 04:49.957
You ain't cooking?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.258
Oh, you are confusing me

04:51.291 --> 04:53.260
with your wannabe-chef
ex-boyfriend.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.829
-Oh, shady when he's hungry.
-And you know this.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.531
-Thank you.
-Uh-huh.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.868
And I look better, too.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.002
-You do.
-(elevator bell chimes)

05:04.004 --> 05:06.340
(laughing):
You are not my pizza.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.842
-Oh, my God. Hey.
-Hi, lovely.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.177
How are you?

05:12.245 --> 05:13.981
JAMAL:
Wynter.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.315
What the hell?

05:15.349 --> 05:18.285
-Ah.
-JAMAL: Oh.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.653
-(Wynter laughs)
-Oh, okay.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.122
-It never gets old, does it?
-I'll clean it up.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.157
-Okay, actually, it does.
Hi, darling.
-Hi.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.394
(Wynter sighs)

05:26.427 --> 05:27.995
(gasps) Oh.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.730
-Did you know she was...?
-No.
-Good Lord,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.632
this place is enormous.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.467
JAMAL:
Um, Wynter,

05:33.501 --> 05:35.569
what the hell
are you doing here?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.805
Well, you've convinced me

05:37.838 --> 05:40.173
to sign to your lovely
little London label,

05:40.207 --> 05:42.309
making all sorts of promises,

05:42.342 --> 05:43.911
and then you ran out on me.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.546
-Okay, that's a little dramatic.
-You sure?

05:45.579 --> 05:48.348
We just video conferenced,
like, two days ago.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.983
Okay, enough of that.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.386
We are going to finish my album,

05:52.420 --> 05:55.255
and we are going to do it here.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.925
-Huh.
-Mm-hmm.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.994
Where's your loo?
And where am I going to sleep?

06:01.028 --> 06:04.364
Um... I'm gonna take her stuff.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.539
COOKIE:
Look, I hate to admit this,

06:11.572 --> 06:13.741
but we really need
this deal to work.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.544
No, I can't be letting this man
disrespect me.

06:16.577 --> 06:20.448
Look, TBD are Empire artists
who we now manage.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.683
That breaks the dam.
Don't you see?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.951
We can get others.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.086
Artists who already have
big label deals.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.456
That's money in the bank,
and we need it.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.390
KINGSLEY:
I don't want to hear any more
about Lucious's genius.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.292
-I'm not doing it.
-Okay, look
at the bigger picture.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.928
Okay? You were the one
that wanted

06:34.962 --> 06:37.364
to bring Lucious back into
the fold just a few weeks ago.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.366
-Remember?
-Well, that was
before he effectively

06:39.399 --> 06:41.268
threw the gauntlet down.
He started his own firm.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.970
-He slapped me in the face.
-Come here.

06:43.003 --> 06:47.107
Aren't you the one that
always puts data over emotion?

06:47.140 --> 06:49.142
Right? This is
a smart business move.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.611
LUCIOUS:
Well, what about Giselle?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.412
Can you trust her?

06:52.446 --> 06:55.415
Bunk trust.
We watch that bitch like a hawk.

06:55.449 --> 06:58.819
And we get this money
in the meantime.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.054
Okay?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.657
-(sighs)
-Come on.

07:03.691 --> 07:07.394
GISELLE:
They do all the work.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.731
We make all the money. Simple.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.165
LUCIOUS:
Hey, look here, man.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.001
At the end of the day,

07:14.034 --> 07:16.436
all my baby and I
are trying to do

07:16.470 --> 07:20.974
is-is make some good music,
build our company

07:21.008 --> 07:22.776
and-and leave a great legacy.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.312
Now, I can't expect you
to understand or appreciate

07:25.345 --> 07:28.849
working for something
that's bigger than yourself.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.451
But I promise you, Jeff,
if you get out of your own way

07:31.485 --> 07:34.021
and allow me and Cookie
to do our thing

07:34.054 --> 07:36.924
with these Divas,
I guarantee you,

07:36.957 --> 07:39.026
it's going to pay off.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.734
Deal.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.741
(sighs)

07:56.009 --> 07:57.911
*

08:05.886 --> 08:07.888
-PORSHA: Yes.
-Okay, so, to all my blue-eyed

08:07.921 --> 08:09.389
queens in Staten Island,
I need you to bring the force.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.824
I'll be waiting.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.526
Cookie out.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.062
-How's that?
-I mean, it was all right.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.730
But, Cookie, don't nobody want
to see no commercial.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.032
They want the real,
like last time. Your feelings.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.701
Your heart. You know
how you poured yourself out?

08:20.734 --> 08:21.969
The people really like that.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.503
I didn't say
I would open up a main vein

08:23.537 --> 08:25.038
every time I open up my mouth.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.907
And you need to know,
honey, every time

08:26.940 --> 08:29.643
I use this GlamSugar,

08:29.677 --> 08:31.645
Lyon Family Management
get a check.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.682
-You know what that mean?
You get a check.
-Okay.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.684
-You get a check.
You get a check.
-What?

08:36.717 --> 08:40.153
-Y'all get a check! Yes!
-(cheering)

08:40.187 --> 08:42.055
-What's my numbers?
-They're still high.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.091
-Not like last week,
but they're good.
-COOKIE: Okay.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.492
But wait. Oh, snap.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.160
-Wait a second. Uh, wait.
-COOKIE: What?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.596
Where'd they go?
They all just disappeared.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.998
All your followers
just disappeared.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.933
-Well, how the hell
does that happen?
-See, look,

08:52.966 --> 08:54.234
it's, like, some green blob.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.003
-This ain't good.
-CANDACE: Franklin?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.607
Baby, come here.
Help out your auntie.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.609
Come here, baby.
I need a millennial. Come here.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.376
What happened?
How do I get the followers back?

09:03.410 --> 09:05.245
Oh, this is a B-Glitch.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.180
-What?
-A what?
-Oh.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.381
"B" stands for "bitch."

09:08.415 --> 09:09.950
It's just my term
for pesky things

09:09.983 --> 09:11.852
that pop up out of nowhere.
I can get rid of it.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.021
-Well, you have that bitch
get my numbers back.
-Okay?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.790
(all laugh)

09:16.824 --> 09:20.894
He is just so technical
and smart and handsome.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.896
Ooh, sis, you did a good job.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.698
Thank you.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.300
He's happy to be here.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.807
Teri, I know you're upset.
I'm upset, too.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.543
What good are
all the witnesses we found

09:36.576 --> 09:38.445
if the judge won't admit
their testimony?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.547
I never said this would be easy.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.450
-(phone vibrates)
-Let me rethink strategy,
and I'll circle back

09:43.483 --> 09:44.752
-in a couple of months.
-Months?

09:44.785 --> 09:47.087
-I have to take this. Hello?
-Wait.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.557
Teri. You all right?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.225
What we need is a new D.A.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.327
who cares
about the justice system

09:54.361 --> 09:55.829
and less
about his conviction rate.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.065
Well, we need to take this
to the court of public opinion.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.900
Quincy has a lot of people
who care about him.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.268
Let's-let's get them down here.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.940
When I am done,
everybody in this city

10:06.974 --> 10:09.710
is gonna know Quincy's name.
I guarantee it.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.613
Thank you, Andre.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.083
-For what?
-I'm just...

10:16.116 --> 10:19.086
I'm so happy I'm not
doing this alone anymore.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.021
Yeah.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.956
It's gonna be okay.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.525
You got it. Come on.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.260
Let's catch a cab.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.529
-Hey.
-("Make It Last" playing)

10:29.562 --> 10:32.299
-* So let it last
-* Make it last forever *

10:32.332 --> 10:35.335
* We gotta make this last

10:35.368 --> 10:37.337
* Make it last forever *

10:37.370 --> 10:39.139
* 'Cause I love you

10:39.172 --> 10:41.141
-* Yes, I love
-* Make it last forever *

10:41.174 --> 10:44.778
-* Yes, I do, yes, I do
-* Make it last forever *

10:44.812 --> 10:46.213
* When you need me

10:46.246 --> 10:48.115
* Yes, I do

10:48.148 --> 10:49.950
* I love

10:49.983 --> 10:51.852
* Let's dance forever

10:51.885 --> 10:54.287
* Let's live forever

10:54.321 --> 10:57.490
-* This love's forever
-* Gonna make it last *

10:57.524 --> 11:01.328
* Oh, I wanna love

11:01.361 --> 11:03.997
* Oh...

11:04.031 --> 11:06.734
* Yes, I do

11:06.767 --> 11:08.635
* Oh... *

11:08.668 --> 11:10.237
-(music stops)
-COOKIE: Yes!

11:10.270 --> 11:12.039
What black woman raised you?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.540
-Ma. (chuckles)
-COOKIE: That's a whole lot

11:13.573 --> 11:15.142
of gospel music up in that girl.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.877
She took us to church in here,

11:16.910 --> 11:18.478
-didn't she?
-See?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.714
That was amazing, boo.
Just chill for a second,

11:20.748 --> 11:22.082
we gonna comp a couple things.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.984
Mike, do the, um...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.219
-You are something else.
You know that?
-It's Jamal.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.655
He brings it out of me
like nobody else.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.758
I would follow him anywhere.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.092
Well, you followed him
to the right place, honey,

11:32.125 --> 11:34.027
because Lyon Family Management

11:34.061 --> 11:36.029
will give you
exactly what you looking for.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.430
Huge record deal.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.734
-(chuckles)
-Ma, what's good?

11:40.768 --> 11:43.070
You-you propositioning
my artist now?

11:43.103 --> 11:45.072
Uh, Jamal, calm down.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.207
I'm just walking Wynter
through all her options

11:47.240 --> 11:48.742
if she sign with us.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.710
(Jamal chuckles)

11:50.744 --> 11:53.713
I think that Wynter
understands her options.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.716
-She's very smart. (chuckles)
-I'm sure she is. She's here.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.752
-Right. (chuckles)
-(laughs)

11:58.786 --> 11:59.887
And, um,
she's got her own people.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.190
But you already know
that you are the queen.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.592
Yeah, but her people ain't us.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.061
You need to get
with the Lyons, baby.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.729
-JAMAL: No, I don't...
-(growls)

12:09.763 --> 12:12.599
-Ma, come on.
-Yes. You in the right place.

12:12.632 --> 12:13.767
-Queen, come on.
-That's right.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.904
Queen Lyon. Rawr. Yes, okay.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.705
-COOKIE: My house,
this is my house, damn it.
-We good.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.607
(laughs)
She's sweet.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.877
She is sweet.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.946
(indistinct chatter)

12:25.979 --> 12:27.781
-Hey, Selle.
-Hey.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.749
Could've sworn
I saw Lucious walking around

12:29.783 --> 12:31.718
-with Three Black Divas earlier.
-Shh.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.586
Yes, you did. They're working
on some new music.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.222
-Can you run point on that
for me, please?
-I'm sorry,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.057
working, as in being managed by?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.758
TBD was supposed to be dropped
from the label,

12:38.792 --> 12:40.293
-and now they're LFM clients?
-Okay, okay.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.495
-What is happening?
-I convinced them to sign

12:42.529 --> 12:44.998
with Lucious and Cookie. I
thought it would be a good move.

12:45.032 --> 12:48.301
For them or for you?
What is happening?

12:48.335 --> 12:50.637
-Why are you exploiting
the war between...
-(shushing)

12:50.670 --> 12:53.173
Why are you exploiting the war
between Lucious and Kingsley?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.742
You have to trust me, okay?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.345
Lucious is either gonna scare
Kingsley straight

12:58.378 --> 12:59.779
or scare him out of here.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.282
-Either way, we win.
-All right.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.617
But let me remind you,
the last high yellow heifer

13:04.651 --> 13:07.187
that was running around here
making moves like that

13:07.220 --> 13:09.756
ended up crashing into a table
full of champagne.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.658
Do I look like boo boo kitty
to you?

13:11.691 --> 13:13.793
I am way smarter than Anika was.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.362
And can I be honest?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.530
If you maneuvered
a little bit more,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.366
you'd rise to the top faster.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.669
Moves aren't all that bad.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.337
(clicks tongue)

13:24.371 --> 13:26.773
Heifer.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.508
Can't be treating me
like I'm some little boy,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.110
-you know what I'm saying?
-Mm-hmm.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.279
And then-- and it's like every
single thing that I have,

13:32.312 --> 13:33.613
no matter what it is,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.682
automatically just belongs
to her.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.650
Does it?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.253
Why would you ask that?

13:42.055 --> 13:45.358
Jamal, have you told your mom
that we're engaged yet?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.961
Ah. No.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.898
Um, I guess I'm just--
I'm waiting, waiting...

13:50.931 --> 13:53.600
Waiting to catch her
at a time when she'll agree?

13:54.868 --> 13:57.670
You just don't understand.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.907
I do understand, babe, but...

13:59.940 --> 14:03.243
you keep opening up space
for her to come and control you,

14:03.276 --> 14:06.013
and... I don't know,

14:06.046 --> 14:07.948
Cookie just walks right into it.

14:10.050 --> 14:14.521
You don't need her permission
to be your own man.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.390
That's all I'm saying.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.726
Yeah.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.596
*

14:23.630 --> 14:26.766
Cookie, this is amazing.
What's your secret?

14:26.799 --> 14:30.237
It's my special
"change your life" spices.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.073
-Well, I need a bloody good
change in my life.
-(chuckles)

14:33.106 --> 14:35.875
I don't know how I'm gonna
afford the plane ticket home.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.611
Well, as soon as you sign
with us, those worries

14:38.645 --> 14:40.547
will... disappear.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.249
-(laughs)
-(Jamal chuckles)

14:42.282 --> 14:43.850
Hey, Wynter,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.118
um, they need you-- actually,

14:45.152 --> 14:46.753
all y'all-- in the studio.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.957
-On my way, chief.
-Yes. Make that hit, honey.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.424
Oh, thank you, baby.
I got more now.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.425
-See ya in there.
-Leftovers.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.563
-Ma.
-Yes?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.798
Come on. What part of...

14:58.831 --> 15:01.701
"please leave my artist alone"
do you not understand?

15:01.734 --> 15:04.537
That girl is fire, Jamal.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.473
If we don't sign her,
somebody else will.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.808
Yeah, see,
somebody already did. Me.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.810
Wynter's mine.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.645
Oh. So what's yours is yours,

15:12.679 --> 15:14.814
while you up in my studio
recording.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.284
Okay. All right, you got me.
But you c--

15:17.317 --> 15:20.053
I feel like you could have
at least come to me

15:20.087 --> 15:22.322
out of respect instead
of just going behind my back.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.823
Mm, I'm not behind your back,
child.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.458
I'm right in front of your face
in this kitchen.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.560
-Boy, what is your problem?
-For one,

15:27.594 --> 15:28.761
I'm tired of being called "boy"

15:28.795 --> 15:30.463
when we're talking
about business. Mom,

15:30.497 --> 15:31.664
-I'm a grown man, with-with...
-Ooh.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.401
No. With a-a home and a label

15:34.434 --> 15:36.703
and a life.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.276
And a fiancé.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.911
You and Kai?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.746
-Yes.
-Oh. So you talking

15:46.779 --> 15:47.914
about doing things
behind people's back.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.816
I didn't know that happened.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.251
Behind my back.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.687
Or you could just say,
"Congratulations,

15:54.721 --> 15:56.356
my son."
(chuckles)

15:56.389 --> 15:57.857
(laughs)

15:57.890 --> 15:59.326
Mom. Really?

15:59.359 --> 16:02.662
Yes.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.997
You a beast, Cookie Lyon.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.598
-I know.
-But so am I.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.167
Okay, well...

16:07.200 --> 16:09.702
You a pain in my ass,
that's what you are.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.338
-Morning, nephew.
-Hey, Auntie.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.543
(sighs)

16:16.576 --> 16:19.312
-Morning, sis.
-Hey. Good morning.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.947
You okay?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.883
-I'm just peachy keen. (scoffs)
-Uh-huh.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.388
-See you in there.
-Mm-hmm.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.232
(footsteps approaching)

16:40.267 --> 16:41.734
Is she still in there?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.503
-Yeah, she is.
-Mm.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.572
Wh-What's happening here?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.807
You haven't seen the bruises
on Candace's wrists?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.876
Somebody is hitting on her,

16:49.909 --> 16:52.479
and I can't imagine
that little punk-ass Kevin.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.048
Oh, honey, I can. You know
they used to battle real hard

16:55.082 --> 16:56.516
-when I was
staying with them, right?
-Huh?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.085
No wonder they got separated.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.253
Separated?
Why didn't she tell me?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.425
What the hell is this?

17:05.458 --> 17:06.826
Pull your sleeve up, Candace.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.428
-What? Are you...
-Just do it.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.430
Don't touch me.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.931
Candace, please?

17:11.964 --> 17:14.167
-I will not.
-COOKIE: Okay, damn it. How long

17:14.201 --> 17:16.603
has Kevin been beating you
and why didn't you tell us?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.139
You are out of your league
and out of your mind.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.242
Nobody is hitting me.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.244
Not Kevin or anyone.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.581
Excuse me.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.083
However,

17:30.117 --> 17:32.185
I will beat the hell out
of both of you

17:32.219 --> 17:33.920
if you don't mind your business

17:33.953 --> 17:36.723
and stay out of my face
about this.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.595
Deny, deny, deny.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.364
She getting her ass whupped.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.333
She damn sure is.
Mm, mm.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.074
* Look what you've done,
gone and turned me to a savage *

17:55.108 --> 17:57.076
* Comin' for the bags,
bet I make out *

17:57.110 --> 17:58.545
-* Like a bandit
-Yes.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.147
* With all the smoke,
when I roll up... *

18:00.180 --> 18:01.714
(music stops)

18:01.748 --> 18:04.417
The market appeal here
is limited, wouldn't you agree?

18:04.451 --> 18:07.487
Dude, I know what I'm doing.
How do you think I built Empire?

18:07.520 --> 18:08.955
I know what sells.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.390
The song will struggle,

18:10.423 --> 18:12.392
because it's missing
certain keywords and references

18:12.425 --> 18:14.661
that audiences respond to.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.996
Check your phones.
That's from me.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.531
(phone buzzes)

18:20.533 --> 18:22.169
LUCIOUS:
This is a chart.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.404
Infographics.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.639
It's proven that when
certain keywords are mentioned

18:26.673 --> 18:28.308
in a song by a female act,

18:28.341 --> 18:30.910
the predominantly female
audiences will respond better.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.447
Of course. Because women
are like Pavlov's dogs?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.816
The same is true for
the male audiences. Scroll down,

18:36.849 --> 18:39.852
and you'll see a good list
of options for the next track.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.125
"Home," "family," and "love."
You kidding me, right?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.995
I would have to rework
the whole song.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.197
If anybody can do it,

18:50.230 --> 18:53.132
it's you, Lucious.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.467
After all,

18:54.501 --> 18:57.069
you started Empire.

19:01.308 --> 19:04.677
These are great photos
of Quincy.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.846
My contact at the Times
wants us to choose

19:06.879 --> 19:08.981
the best three
for a story he's running.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.383
I still can't believe
that you were able

19:10.417 --> 19:12.151
to arrange that so quickly.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.687
Let's just hope
this media attention works.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.123
Which is why the right picture
is everything.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.126
A drunk white girl
goes missing on vacation,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.529
we get blinded by her halo
in the news.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.298
A black child gets murdered
in the streets,

19:25.332 --> 19:27.667
first picture you see of him
is in a hoodie,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.168
like he's some thug.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.003
That will not be my baby.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.340
It won't happen.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.707
I promise.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.215
Who's this?

19:43.450 --> 19:46.185
That Quincy's dad?

19:46.219 --> 19:48.588
I left him because I thought

19:48.621 --> 19:51.023
he was a bad influence
on Quincy.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.159
Maybe if I hadn't, he would've

19:53.192 --> 19:55.862
learned better
how to handle himself.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.531
In the streets, around the cops.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.767
I-I did what I thought
was right, but...

20:00.800 --> 20:02.702
did it get my baby locked up?

20:02.735 --> 20:03.936
No, no. No.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.872
Teri, it's not your fault.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.744
We're gonna get Quincy out
of there.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.846
And I'm not gonna stop
until he's home.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.283
You are not alone in this,
you hear me?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.287
I'm with you.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.200
Mm.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.802
I'm sorry.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.107
-(whoops)
-(gunfire on TV)

20:42.809 --> 20:45.044
Oh, that's it.
It's a wrap for me.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.046
-I got to wake up early
with the kids.
-Ha.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.915
(laughter, snorting)

20:48.948 --> 20:51.551
-MARCEL: This guy.
-Right. Look at Hakeem,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.886
being all responsible
and parental.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.822
-Never thought I'd see the day.
-Well, you see it.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.124
Aw, hell no.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.593
-What is it?
-Alert from TMI.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.128
Look like they got ahold
of your diss track.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.229
I took it down.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.064
The Internet is forever, bro.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.633
Right. And that's not all.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.900
Blake heard it.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.736
He released a diss track.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.271
* I hope you ain't planning
on standing there *

21:12.305 --> 21:15.174
* With them little toy guns,
'cause when men go to war *

21:15.207 --> 21:17.410
* That's when
the little boys run *

21:17.444 --> 21:20.580
* Hakeem who? He so late, oh,
that's your girl? She no safe *

21:20.613 --> 21:22.114
* I steal your chick,
then wipe the prints *

21:22.148 --> 21:24.984
* 'Cause under pressure
egos break, I peeped your fate *

21:25.017 --> 21:27.019
* And it's really looking bad
for you, son *

21:27.053 --> 21:30.289
* So treat Tiana like your queen
instead of acting like one *

21:30.323 --> 21:31.824
* Okay, I got a dark heart
but it *

21:31.858 --> 21:33.360
* Just got darker,
why go against me? *

21:33.393 --> 21:35.027
* Don't ever bother,
you know I run you *

21:35.061 --> 21:37.664
* So after I sun you, maybe
it help you be a better father *

21:37.697 --> 21:39.366
* They won't know a thing
when they saw ya *

21:39.399 --> 21:41.634
* Well, here's an anonymous tip,
since you got the sauce *

21:41.668 --> 21:43.436
* Then after I shoot you,
the police can follow *

21:43.470 --> 21:45.872
* The drip, flip flop

21:45.905 --> 21:47.206
* Flip flippidy flop

21:47.239 --> 21:50.142
*

21:50.176 --> 21:53.279
-Damn, bro.
-CHICKEN:
Hey, so you're really gonna let

21:53.312 --> 21:55.682
this walking jar of mayonnaise
come for you like that?

21:55.715 --> 21:58.818
If war he wants,
war he gonna to get.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.526
Listen, y'all. I need real
ideas. Ideas. Who got 'em?

22:06.559 --> 22:08.895
Man, you done
had us here all night.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.563
Because I'm trying
to get the right record

22:10.597 --> 22:12.832
to blast Blake out of here...

22:12.865 --> 22:15.334
once and for all.

22:15.368 --> 22:18.237
Yeah, bro, end this man.
He came for your kids.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.072
-What does he care about?
-CHICKEN:
I mean, his pops already

22:20.106 --> 22:21.908
checked out,
so that doesn't work.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.711
-He got a girl?
-Nah. That's why
he coming at mine.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.680
Yeah, I really don't think Blake
got anything going on right now.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.616
I mean, it's kind of sad.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.753
Maybe that's what
you should talk about.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.958
Hey, yo, pass me my phone.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.364
So you just gonna
go off the dome?

22:45.398 --> 22:47.500
Something like that.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.268
Hey, what's up, world?

22:49.301 --> 22:50.770
I know you heard Blake diss

22:50.803 --> 22:52.271
and you're waiting
for me to reply.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.774
But you gonna
be waiting for years,

22:54.807 --> 22:57.009
because this beef
between me and Blake--

22:57.043 --> 22:59.879
it'll sell records for, like,
one or two weeks,

22:59.912 --> 23:01.614
and then what?
Y'all forget about it,

23:01.648 --> 23:03.916
and then my family gets dragged
through the mud?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.785
Nah, I ain't about that life.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.353
I got two beautiful children

23:07.386 --> 23:10.857
that mean more
than this battle to me.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.925
So I'm deading this right now.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.127
I'm shutting it down.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.764
Out.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.299
Yo, what did you just do?

23:20.332 --> 23:23.102
Something that shouldn't even
been there in the first place.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.838
I'm-a go check on my babies.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.750
So, what's good, man?

23:37.784 --> 23:39.385
-Look at you.
-(chuckles)

23:39.418 --> 23:41.287
Yeah, you're looking good.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.156
-Outside treating you well?
-Ah, you know.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.392
As well
as it ever treated men like us.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.727
Mm.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.261
Anybody bothering Quincy?

23:49.295 --> 23:52.164
Nah. I told you
I'd look out for him. (sniffles)

23:52.198 --> 23:54.834
Uh... I got to be real
with you, though.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.103
He has had some bad days.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.338
I'm afraid he's gonna crack.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.807
(Andre sighs)

24:00.840 --> 24:02.274
That's why I'm here.

24:04.511 --> 24:08.447
I've been planning
this media blitz thing, Mouse.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.617
It's taking too long, so...

24:10.650 --> 24:13.452
Dre, you fresh out.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.755
Why you still doin' for Quincy

24:15.788 --> 24:18.725
when you need
to just do for you?

24:20.493 --> 24:22.394
Because I can.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.533
And I should.

24:26.566 --> 24:29.268
Listen...

24:29.301 --> 24:31.470
I need a favor.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.840
Now, it's not a small one,

24:33.873 --> 24:36.909
but I can make it
worth your while.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.847
I'm listening.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.328
Candace, I'm sorry.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.197
I was just being concerned.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.399
I told you, I'm fine.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.402
Okay.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.838
Well, can you help me, then?

25:05.872 --> 25:07.540
Porsha thinks
I need to be more personal

25:07.574 --> 25:10.009
-on Instagram, so... (chuckles)
-(chuckles)

25:10.042 --> 25:12.579
Maybe we do a video, um, showing
the world how we work together

25:12.612 --> 25:16.215
-as a family, as "sistors."
-Mm. Let me go get my face on.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.751
-All right. (chuckles)
-Mom, Dad's here.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.387
What?! No!

25:22.454 --> 25:24.490
What are you doing coming here?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.325
You do see I'm at work, right?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.761
I'm not here to fight.
I just need my black suit.

25:28.795 --> 25:31.664
I stopped by the house
to get it and found out

25:31.698 --> 25:33.432
my keys no longer work.
Really, Candace?

25:33.465 --> 25:35.034
CANDACE:
If you had gotten your stuff

25:35.067 --> 25:36.603
out of there
when I asked you to...

25:36.636 --> 25:38.104
Uh-uh. You need
to get out of my house.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.106
-This is not your business.
-This is my house,

25:40.139 --> 25:42.508
so it is.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.444
Franklin, give your father
your keys.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.446
I don't want to.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.548
Do it.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.897
What are y'all looking at?

26:04.931 --> 26:07.566
This is what divorce
looks like, okay?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.638
Mom, I don't want him there.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.710
Son... it'll be okay.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.445
He's in our house.

26:19.478 --> 26:20.780
Please. We need to go.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.117
I'm sorry, Cook.
We got to go.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.953
Come on.

26:29.922 --> 26:30.990
(door opens)

26:31.023 --> 26:32.258
What the hell just happened?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.093
(door closes)

26:34.126 --> 26:37.263
They're both scared of Kevin,
that's what happened.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.570
(footsteps approaching)

26:44.603 --> 26:46.673
You need something?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.746
I came to invite you
to my house for dinner.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.815
Excuse me?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.583
Jeff, if you and I
are gonna work together,

26:57.616 --> 27:00.452
we need to get
to know each other.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.655
So how about
we break some bread?

27:02.689 --> 27:04.657
Are you serious?
You're...

27:04.691 --> 27:06.693
you're inviting me to your home?

27:06.726 --> 27:09.461
I'm not gonna ask you again.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.765
All right.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.434
I'm in.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.436
Good.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.371
Eight o'clock.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.922
*

27:53.372 --> 27:55.541
Hey, Ma.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.509
How you doing today?

27:59.578 --> 28:01.714
I have some good news.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.418
The monster has invited me
into his lair.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.691
I'm getting closer to him.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.262
He thinks he can ambush me.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.671
I will make him pay

28:25.704 --> 28:27.639
for what he did to you.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.447
I swear.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.960
Man, I can't wait till
Juanita come back full-time.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.929
You ever think about how bougie
you sound sometimes, though?

28:49.962 --> 28:52.564
-Man, shut up.
-Just, like, so beyond raggedy.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.300
-Shut up.
-(laughs)
-LUCIOUS: Hey, Jeff.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.468
-Hey.
-Welcome, man. Didn't mean
to start without you,

28:56.502 --> 28:58.570
but the mashed potatoes
get cold quick.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.239
I didn't realize
the whole family would be here.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.908
COOKIE:
Well, you better hurry up
and make you a plate,

29:01.941 --> 29:04.243
'cause we don't have servants
around here no more.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.212
Did y'all know your brother
was getting married?

29:06.245 --> 29:08.047
Oh, you finally sacked up
and told her, huh?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.582
-Uh...
-We been knew, Ma. You're late.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.151
LUCIOUS:
Yeah, I'm telling you something,

29:12.184 --> 29:14.153
I'm not sure I'm ready

29:14.186 --> 29:16.055
to see my son marry a dude, but

29:16.088 --> 29:18.724
I have to say, Kai's a nice guy.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.659
Dad, shut up, all right?
Your ass is gonna be

29:20.692 --> 29:22.428
sitting there
like everybody else.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.430
Don't be telling me to shut up.
I'll stab you

29:24.463 --> 29:26.398
-in the neck with a spoon.
-Shut up.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.235
You mean to tell me
I'm the last to know?

29:29.268 --> 29:31.303
-I saved the best for last.
-Oh, boy.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.906
Ma, also, don't nobody want you
putting them on blast

29:33.940 --> 29:35.407
on your social media
or whatever.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.476
COOKIE:
Uh, first of all, I am

29:37.509 --> 29:40.412
an influencer
on the social media, honey.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.082
I change and touch lives,
if you hadn't noticed.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.118
I have checked out
some of your posts. Very savvy.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.686
I think you're appealing
to an untapped audience.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.155
Thank you.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.589
LUCIOUS:
Jeff, I wanted
to ask you a question.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.125
You're a tech guy.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.527
So, why Empire?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.763
Well, I have
to credit my mother.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.999
She, uh... she raised me
on the Empire sound.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.467
-She loved it.
-COOKIE: Mm.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.135
She called it "the new Motown."

30:03.169 --> 30:05.504
Sounds like your mama
had a good grasp for music.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.973
What happened to you?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.709
Greens good, aren't they?

30:10.742 --> 30:12.778
-(chuckles)
-Delicious.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.280
What about you, Lucious?

30:14.313 --> 30:16.815
Why Empire?

30:16.849 --> 30:18.817
What do you mean?

30:18.851 --> 30:22.054
Well,
I've read all the articles,

30:22.088 --> 30:24.556
seen all the documentaries.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.693
You used to be a street hustler,
slinging drugs.

30:27.726 --> 30:29.528
LUCIOUS:
Yeah.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.564
Yeah, we did what we had to do
back then, man.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.900
You ever feel guilty about it?

30:33.933 --> 30:36.135
Those drugs ruined a lot
of people's lives.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.505
-Yo, man, ease up on that.
-No, no, no, it's all right.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.909
Actually,
I'm really happy for Jeff

30:42.942 --> 30:45.477
that he'll never know
what it's like to live without.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.080
But I had three children
to raise, so...

30:48.114 --> 30:50.682
I don't make any excuses for
what I had to do to make sure

30:50.716 --> 30:53.852
-they ate. I'm not gonna
apologize for that.
-Damn right.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.854
But when this is over,
when we finish with this meal,

30:55.888 --> 30:57.890
I'm gonna take you
into the studio with my boys,

30:57.924 --> 30:59.658
if they'll come,
and I'll show you

30:59.691 --> 31:02.394
what came out
of all that struggle.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.497
Mmm. We can have some salt,
baby?

31:05.531 --> 31:08.734
You don't need salt, honey.
I seasoned that food just right.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.804
(strumming gentle melody)

31:13.906 --> 31:15.874
JAMAL:
Oh, Lord.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.476
HAKEEM:
You got it.

31:20.046 --> 31:23.382
* La, da, da, da

31:23.415 --> 31:26.752
* La, da, da, da-da-da...

31:26.785 --> 31:29.021
Now if I have Hakeem join in,

31:29.055 --> 31:31.857
he adds a whole
nother dimension to it.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.225
* Ah...

31:33.259 --> 31:36.195
* La, da, da, da-da-da...

31:36.228 --> 31:37.763
(Hakeem growls)

31:37.796 --> 31:39.898
* First thought a giant,
last thought I'd try it *

31:39.932 --> 31:41.867
* We right here, the Lyons,
you know I'm a problem *

31:41.900 --> 31:43.469
* Loosh tell me to shoot 'em

31:43.502 --> 31:45.404
* I'm-a kill 'em, no problem,
you know that *

31:45.437 --> 31:47.606
* I do it for my babies
on that bottle, see, I do it *

31:47.639 --> 31:49.541
* For my kids
at home on that bottle *

31:49.575 --> 31:51.243
JAMAL:
Hell yeah.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.979
-* At home on that bottle
-(laughs) He crazy.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.913
-HAKEEM: Nah.
-He like himself.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.448
(laughs)

31:56.482 --> 32:00.319
JAMAL:
* Da, da, da, da.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.321
LUCIOUS: That's the thing
about this music.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.922
I mean, it's not something

32:03.956 --> 32:06.825
that you can find
with analytics or on a chart.

32:06.858 --> 32:08.961
You have to understand,
I put that into my sons.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.929
I mean, even Andre.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.832
You can hit him with a problem,
and he's going

32:13.865 --> 32:17.469
to find a thousand different
solutions to that problem.

32:17.503 --> 32:20.339
What I'm saying, Jeff,

32:20.372 --> 32:24.143
is you can't come in here
with catchphrases and

32:24.176 --> 32:28.347
magic words,
like "love" and "family,"

32:28.380 --> 32:31.150
because this is family.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.585
This is love.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.822
This is the alchemy
that-that built the music

32:36.855 --> 32:39.325
that you grew up listening to.

32:39.358 --> 32:42.428
You can't make music
the way you make an app.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.864
If you have the music in you,
then, my God.

32:45.897 --> 32:50.169
But if you don't, then you
should do yourself a favor

32:50.202 --> 32:52.438
and just get out the way

32:52.471 --> 32:54.840
and let us Lyons do what we do.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.508
You feel me?

32:58.510 --> 33:01.347
I think so.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.116
It's great that you have
an education, Jeff,

33:04.150 --> 33:05.984
but you can learn a lot
from Pop, trust me.

33:07.553 --> 33:11.557
Yes... your father is
a great teacher.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.529
Man, I was really feeling
that little melody, though, man.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.131
-(laughs)
-JAMAL: There you go.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.633
I didn't expect to like it
that much, man.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.135
Come on. Give me that back.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.570
Give me that back.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.705
(strumming guitar)

33:33.712 --> 33:36.748
JAMAL:
* Da, da, da, da

33:36.782 --> 33:39.185
LUCIOUS:
* Da, da, da, da.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.920
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

33:52.298 --> 33:55.234
What'd I tell you? Inviting Jeff
was the right thing.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.269
I didn't think it would work.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.771
(chuckles) But we finally got
the Divas' song

33:59.805 --> 34:01.873
back on track for the showcase.

34:01.907 --> 34:03.242
I got to hand it to you.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.577
You got to hand it to me?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.579
-Yeah.
-What you gonna hand to me?

34:07.613 --> 34:09.848
-I don't know... (laughs)
-Okay. Yuck, yuck, yuck.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.218
Don't y'all know this is a place
of business? Go get a room.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.253
Oh, speaking of business,
I got to get to the studio.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.754
-I love you, baby.
-I love you, too.

34:15.787 --> 34:18.224
-Thanks, Carol.
-You're welcome, Lucious.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.459
-What is it?
-It's Candace.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.729
You know she hasn't shown up and
she's not answering the phone.

34:23.762 --> 34:27.433
That's not like Candace.
She always has that phone.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.468
Right.

34:29.501 --> 34:33.739
I say, let's go pay her a visit.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.108
And if Kevin is beating on her,
I'm gonna kill his ass.

34:36.142 --> 34:37.676
You're gonna have
to stand in line.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.814
Wow. (chuckles)

34:42.848 --> 34:44.216
That looks great.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.218
Now we just have to get
a thousand more printed.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.154
Well...

34:48.187 --> 34:51.022
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.763
Listen, um...

35:00.266 --> 35:03.669
About the other night...

35:03.702 --> 35:07.606
I shouldn't have.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.108
Until Quincy gets out,
he's pretty much...

35:10.142 --> 35:11.577
all I can think about.

35:11.610 --> 35:15.581
Yeah. Yeah,
I understand that, um...

35:15.614 --> 35:17.749
We don't have to blow this out
of proportion, you know.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.751
-Right.
-Cool. Great.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.119
-(laughs)
-(phone ringing)

35:21.153 --> 35:22.321
Um...

35:26.558 --> 35:29.027
Yeah?

35:29.060 --> 35:31.830
What?

35:31.863 --> 35:34.766
Y-Y-You're kidding me?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.768
When?

35:36.802 --> 35:39.738
Does that mean...?

35:41.139 --> 35:43.175
Yeah, yeah. Call me back.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.777
That was our lawyer.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.547
Someone, an inmate,

35:48.580 --> 35:51.350
someone already doing time
confessed to the robbery.

35:51.383 --> 35:55.954
His account matches the
witnesses' initial description.

35:55.987 --> 35:59.057
-So, what, Quincy's getting out?
-The judge has to sign off,

35:59.090 --> 36:01.960
but... yeah.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.831
Yeah, oh, my baby's getting out.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.966
(laughs)

36:07.999 --> 36:12.904
You should've seen the act
he put on in front of me.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.173
Trotting out his family
like some sort

36:15.207 --> 36:18.910
of ghetto
Norman Rockwell painting.

36:18.944 --> 36:24.250
He went on and on about all the
musical talent he gave his sons.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.953
About how Cookie was
his ride-or-die.

36:32.224 --> 36:35.261
He's trying to erase us.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.566
But I won't let that happen.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.034
Diana Dubois said that the way
to hurt Lucious

36:43.068 --> 36:46.004
is to destroy his ego...

36:46.037 --> 36:48.740
destroy his legacy.

36:48.774 --> 36:52.978
I'm going to erase him
from the face of the earth.

36:57.082 --> 37:01.820
How's that for talent, Dad?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.134
(sighs)

37:18.804 --> 37:20.739
-(Candace screams)
-(glass breaks)

37:22.073 --> 37:24.776
What's going on?

37:24.810 --> 37:28.246
-Candace? Kevin!
-Candace! Candace!

37:28.280 --> 37:30.549
(grunting)

37:30.582 --> 37:32.217
Oh, no!

37:32.250 --> 37:34.486
Get off her! Franklin!

37:34.520 --> 37:37.556
-(screams)
-CANDACE: No, Franklin, no!

37:37.589 --> 37:39.591
I hate you!

37:39.625 --> 37:41.226
(Franklin screaming)

37:41.259 --> 37:43.762
Stop it, Franklin, stop, stop!

37:43.795 --> 37:44.763
(Candace choking)

37:46.465 --> 37:48.600
(screaming)

37:48.634 --> 37:49.635
(gasps)

37:49.668 --> 37:51.570
Candace, are you okay?

37:51.603 --> 37:53.104
(grunts)

37:53.138 --> 37:55.474
(screams)

37:55.507 --> 37:57.409
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.511
(gasping)

37:59.545 --> 38:03.014
(Carol screaming)

38:03.048 --> 38:06.284
Come out!

38:06.318 --> 38:08.687
-Stop!
-No, please, stop!

38:08.720 --> 38:10.255
(pounding)

38:10.288 --> 38:11.657
Come out!
Come out!

38:11.690 --> 38:13.325
No, stop it!

38:13.359 --> 38:15.927
(Franklin grunting)

38:15.961 --> 38:18.263
Please hurry...
he-he's gonna kill my sister.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.265
Please hurry.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.767
(Franklin grunting)

38:21.800 --> 38:23.769
-Come on!
-COOKIE: Stop it, Franklin!

38:23.802 --> 38:25.804
-(screaming)
-Franklin, stop!

38:25.837 --> 38:28.273
Come out! Come out!

38:28.306 --> 38:29.775
Franklin, stop!

38:29.808 --> 38:32.043
Franklin, calm down!

38:32.077 --> 38:35.981
Calm down, baby, please.
Please calm down. Okay?

38:36.014 --> 38:40.652
Just calm down.
Just calm down.

38:40.686 --> 38:44.823
Just... Okay. No, no, no,
no, no. Put that down.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.392
The cops are coming.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.727
I need you to put that down,
all right?

38:48.760 --> 38:51.162
Please calm down, okay?

38:51.196 --> 38:53.164
-Just calm down.
-(siren wailing)

38:53.198 --> 38:55.266
Is that the police?

38:58.269 --> 38:59.971
Put that--
put that down, baby. Okay?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.740
They're gonna think
you have a weapon. Please.

39:01.773 --> 39:05.310
Put it down, baby.
Please put it down, okay?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.145
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

39:07.178 --> 39:09.748
Stay right there. Okay, he-he
doesn't have-- he's not armed.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.917
-He's not armed. He's not armed!
-Put your hands up, sir!

39:11.950 --> 39:13.018
Is that police out there?

39:13.051 --> 39:15.253
Just give it a second, please.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.922
-Put your hands up now!
-COOKIE: He's not armed.

39:16.955 --> 39:20.225
-He's not...
-CANDACE: Franklin!

39:20.258 --> 39:23.995
Oh, my God! I said he didn't
have a weapon! Oh, my God.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.031
-Who else is here?
-M-My sisters.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.867
They-They're in the--
they're in the bathroom, hiding.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.669
OFFICER:
You can come out now. He's down!

39:30.702 --> 39:33.672
Franklin! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, my baby.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.741
-Oh, God.
-COOKIE: Candace, he'll be okay.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.509
They just tased him
to calm him down.

39:37.543 --> 39:40.512
-They had to calm him down.
-You called the police?

39:40.546 --> 39:42.614
-I had to.
He was gonna kill you.
-No, wait.

39:42.648 --> 39:44.349
OFFICER: Hey! Calm down,
or else I'll take you both in!

39:44.382 --> 39:45.751
Take him where?

39:45.784 --> 39:47.185
We got to take him downtown,
ma'am.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.720
No, no, you can't take him
anywhere.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.522
He's just 19, Officer.
He's a baby.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.691
He didn't mean it.
He didn't mean it.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.894
He didn't, Officer.
Listen. Officer.

39:55.927 --> 39:59.397
My son has mental issues, and
he's normally perfectly calm.

39:59.431 --> 40:00.966
-(stammering)
-All right, we'll take that

40:00.999 --> 40:02.400
-into consideration...
-If he takes his medicine.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.736
...and notify the proper
authorities, all right?

40:04.770 --> 40:06.472
-Now, make a list of all
of his meds
-No, no, no, Officer.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.073
and bring it downtown to the
precinct with you, okay?

40:08.106 --> 40:09.240
Listen to me, he's got
mental issues, okay?

40:09.274 --> 40:11.710
(sobbing)

40:11.743 --> 40:13.712
Don't hurt him.
Don't hurt my baby.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.413
Wait, Candace... Candace.

40:15.447 --> 40:18.116
No, stay away from me, Cookie.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.819
You called the police on my son!

40:20.852 --> 40:22.654
You could have
gotten him killed.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.658
-I...
-(sobbing)

40:29.427 --> 40:31.296
You are not my sister.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.264
(exhales)

40:36.434 --> 40:39.805
I never want to see you again.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.973
Franklin.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.577
(sobbing):
I mean, he was gonna kill her.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.178
It's okay. It's okay.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.780
What did she want me to do?

40:48.814 --> 40:52.083
He was gonna kill her.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.052
(sobbing):
He was gonna kill her.

40:56.121 --> 41:00.358
-It's okay, Cook.
-(sobbing)

41:02.828 --> 41:05.897
(sighs)

41:19.244 --> 41:21.179
*

41:42.934 --> 41:45.336
Hey, y'all.

41:45.370 --> 41:48.139
It's Cookie.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.242
Uh, (chuckles) I can't hide this

41:51.276 --> 41:56.014
so I might as well... be honest.

41:57.916 --> 42:02.387
Someone I love very much
did this to me.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.255
No, no, no, no, no.

42:04.289 --> 42:09.060
I-It w-wasn't Lucious
or my sons.

42:09.094 --> 42:13.231
It was a very troubled child.

42:15.867 --> 42:19.571
And I had to make a choice.

42:19.605 --> 42:24.109
I did something I never thought
I'd have to do.

42:24.142 --> 42:27.045
I called the police

42:27.078 --> 42:31.016
because I needed to save
one loved one from another.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.018
(sniffs)

42:33.051 --> 42:37.055
And when the cops got there,
I was so scared.

42:40.826 --> 42:45.296
I was scared because...
(exhales)

42:45.330 --> 42:48.033
I thought I would lose someone
I love so much

42:48.066 --> 42:50.902
to a cop's bullet.

42:50.936 --> 42:52.838
(sobs)

42:55.641 --> 42:58.109
Well, that's what it's like
to be black

42:58.143 --> 43:00.846
and brown in this country.

43:02.981 --> 43:05.617
My God...

43:05.651 --> 43:07.786
Who do we call, huh?

43:07.819 --> 43:11.589
Who do we call
when we need help?

43:13.258 --> 43:15.961
Who will protect us?

43:15.994 --> 43:17.929
(shuddering)

43:20.198 --> 43:22.167
(sniffs)

43:22.200 --> 43:24.202

Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:10.015 --> 44:12.317
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:14.419 --> 44:15.653
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.325
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:20.358 --> 44:23.895
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:23.929 --> 44:27.498
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:27.532 --> 44:28.533
MAN: Touchdown!

44:28.566 --> 44:32.137
* Reach out *

44:32.170 --> 44:35.741
* Make this right here
right now *

44:35.774 --> 44:38.710
* Stand up *

44:39.577 --> 44:41.346
* Here right now *

44:41.379 --> 44:43.348
That sounds like fun.
