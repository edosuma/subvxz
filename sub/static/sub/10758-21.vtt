WEBVTT

00:08.283 --> 00:10.869
Know what I could go for?
Some fried eggs and bacon.

00:11.036 --> 00:14.122
- Here's your bran flakes.
- Oh, fine.

00:20.128 --> 00:22.130
Oh, hot.

00:26.343 --> 00:29.096
- Don't give him any toast.
- I'm not.

00:36.645 --> 00:41.149
Lifestyle, Sports and recycling.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.487
Yes, we see you, Eddie.
Eight o'clock on the dot.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.572
Well, he's a dog.
What do you expect?

00:47.739 --> 00:50.075
He's a creature of habit.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.411
- Good morning, all.
- Hey, Fras.

00:53.578 --> 00:54.621
- Dad, Daphne.
- Go on.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.830
- Morning.
- Say, Dad,

00:55.997 --> 00:58.375
you remember that woman
I went out with on Valentine's Day,

00:58.541 --> 01:01.711
but I wasn't quite sure
if it was a romantic thing?

01:01.878 --> 01:04.004
Yeah, that new publicity woman
at the station.

01:04.214 --> 01:05.423
Yes, Cassandra Stone.

01:05.590 --> 01:08.051
Well, I asked her out again last night,
and I got my answer.

01:08.218 --> 01:10.678
Oh, I'm sorry, Fras.

01:13.348 --> 01:14.808
No, I'm not finished.

01:15.016 --> 01:17.519
That's the spirit. You hang in there.

01:18.311 --> 01:19.521
You know, Dr. Crane,

01:19.729 --> 01:21.773
someone once said
that long periods of abstinence

01:21.940 --> 01:23.441
can actually refresh the soul.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.527
- Good morning, everyone.
- That someone was me

01:25.693 --> 01:29.072
and I was full of it.
Everyone, this is Cassandra.

01:29.239 --> 01:31.741
You must be Frasier's dad.
I've heard all about you.

01:31.908 --> 01:33.785
- Marty Crane.
- Nice to meet you.

01:33.952 --> 01:36.704
Well, nice to meet you too.

01:38.039 --> 01:39.165
You are so cute.

01:39.332 --> 01:43.169
Now I see where Frasier
got those gorgeous eyes.

01:43.336 --> 01:47.215
And this is Daphne Moon,
my father's home-healthcare worker.

01:47.382 --> 01:48.758
Hello.

01:48.925 --> 01:50.510
Are you gonna join us for breakfast?

01:50.718 --> 01:52.553
Oh, I could go for an English muffin.

01:52.762 --> 01:55.056
Perhaps our own English muffin
could fetch that for you.

01:58.059 --> 02:01.187
- Or I could get it.
- No, no, I'll get it myself.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.190
Way to go, Fras. I like her.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.691
Gee, I wonder why.

02:05.858 --> 02:09.654
"Now I see where Frasier
gets those gorgeous eyes."

02:11.489 --> 02:12.823
Niles.

02:12.990 --> 02:15.910
Hurry up and get dressed.
Frasier, we'll lose our court.

02:16.118 --> 02:17.912
I must warn you,
I may be unbeatable today.

02:18.079 --> 02:20.373
Our squash pro, Octavio,
taught me a backhand slice

02:20.539 --> 02:23.209
that could shave
the bristles off a kiwi fruit.

02:23.417 --> 02:26.879
Niles, I'm afraid we may
have to reschedule today.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.340
You see, I had a date last night.

02:29.507 --> 02:32.093
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah...

02:33.052 --> 02:34.887
Hey, but there's no sense
moping around.

02:35.095 --> 02:36.764
Game of squash
is the best thing for you.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.974
I can't think of a better way
to lift your spirits.

02:39.141 --> 02:41.560
- Good morning.
- Keep thinking.

02:48.609 --> 02:51.236
I tell you, Roz, the entire evening
was pure magic.

02:51.403 --> 02:52.947
Well, I'm happy for you.

02:53.113 --> 02:54.823
You have been in a dry spell,
haven't you?

02:54.990 --> 02:57.660
Oh, no, Roz. Actually, that was just
the calm before the storm.

02:57.826 --> 03:03.165
I assure you, we are in the midst
of a full-blown love hurricane.

03:03.791 --> 03:07.586
You were so much easier to be around
when you were horny and pathetic.

03:08.128 --> 03:10.297
I'm sorry. I have been
monopolising the conversation.

03:10.464 --> 03:12.508
So, what's going on with you?

03:12.716 --> 03:16.345
Well, actually,
it has been a really exciting week.

03:16.512 --> 03:19.014
Of course, Alice's first birthday party
is this Sunday,

03:19.473 --> 03:21.600
and we're having 12
of her little friends over.

03:21.808 --> 03:23.435
She loves bears,

03:23.602 --> 03:25.520
so the whole party's gonna be
this bear theme:

03:25.687 --> 03:28.190
Party favours, bear cake.

03:28.357 --> 03:31.318
I'm gonna dress up like a bear, I think,
and do a little bear dance.

03:36.031 --> 03:37.783
That's really great
about you and Cassandra.

03:37.949 --> 03:40.786
Yes, yes. We're really
hitting it off, I think.

03:40.952 --> 03:42.537
Frasier?

03:43.246 --> 03:44.998
- Faye.
- Hi.

03:45.207 --> 03:47.292
Oh, my God.

03:47.459 --> 03:48.794
Hey.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.962
Hi, it's been a while.

03:51.129 --> 03:53.757
Gosh, oh, Faye Moskowitz,
this is my producer, Roz Doyle.

03:53.924 --> 03:55.091
- Hey.
- How are you?

03:55.258 --> 03:57.844
So, what have you been up to?

03:58.053 --> 03:59.387
Well, I just got back from Paris.

03:59.554 --> 04:01.890
Really? I didn't even know
you'd gone.

04:02.098 --> 04:03.183
You didn't get my message?

04:03.391 --> 04:05.060
Oh, Frasier, before I forget,
Faye called.

04:05.226 --> 04:07.479
She's going to France for a month.

04:07.938 --> 04:09.939
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

04:10.148 --> 04:11.191
It's great to see you.

04:11.358 --> 04:14.277
- We should get together for coffee.
- I'd love to.

04:14.486 --> 04:16.363
I'm on my way out.
Why don't you take my seat?

04:16.529 --> 04:19.031
- Thanks, if that's all right with you.
- Of course.

04:19.199 --> 04:22.494
Great. Well, I'll put some money
in my meter.

04:23.286 --> 04:25.330
What are you doing?
I can't have coffee with her.

04:25.497 --> 04:27.832
Why not?
Obviously, she's still interested.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.834
I'm seeing Cassandra,
for God's sakes.

04:30.001 --> 04:31.753
I can't date two people at once.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.130
Well, it doesn't have
to be on the same night.

04:34.297 --> 04:37.258
If you're good at faking a headache,
don't mind getting changed in the car...

04:37.425 --> 04:38.801
Roz.

04:39.052 --> 04:42.555
Well, did you tell Cassandra
you were gonna be exclusive to her?

04:43.139 --> 04:44.182
No.

04:44.349 --> 04:46.309
So then you're just dating.

04:46.476 --> 04:50.063
Relax. It's supposed to be fun.
Just see where it takes you.

04:50.229 --> 04:52.899
That sort of lifestyle's all right
for some people but not for me.

04:53.524 --> 04:57.695
I'm a one-woman man, if that.

04:58.571 --> 05:00.364
Okay, suit yourself. Keep it platonic.

05:00.531 --> 05:02.533
Well, that's easy for you to say.

05:02.742 --> 05:04.952
How do you tell somebody
that you're attracted to them

05:05.119 --> 05:06.704
but you just can't sleep with them?

05:06.913 --> 05:09.165
I guess you just say...

05:10.166 --> 05:12.126
You just say...

05:12.293 --> 05:14.545
I'll ask around.

05:16.756 --> 05:18.299
You know what I feel like
this morning?

05:18.466 --> 05:20.217
Some French toast
and sausage patties.

05:20.384 --> 05:23.179
- Here's your bran flakes.
- Oh, fine.

05:29.352 --> 05:31.312
Oh, hot.

05:34.732 --> 05:36.525
You're not giving him any toast,
are you?

05:36.692 --> 05:38.611
Of course not.

05:40.696 --> 05:41.739
- Oh, morning.
- Oh, hey.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.658
- Morning.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.

05:44.867 --> 05:45.951
Did you have a date?

05:49.121 --> 05:50.456
Well, I guess that answers that.

05:50.623 --> 05:53.459
Well, ease up there.
Cassandra's a great gal.

05:53.626 --> 05:55.794
Women like her
don't come along every day.

05:56.003 --> 05:57.296
Morning.

05:57.504 --> 05:59.632
No, they certainly don't.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.594
Dad, Daphne, you remember Faye?

06:03.761 --> 06:06.430
- Hi, Martin, it's good to see you again.
- Oh, yeah, likewise.

06:06.638 --> 06:08.390
And, Daphne, you look gorgeous.

06:08.557 --> 06:10.809
Did you get your hair cut
since the last time I saw you?

06:11.018 --> 06:13.020
Oh, yes, I did. Thank you.

06:13.187 --> 06:15.606
Can I fix you some breakfast?

06:17.524 --> 06:19.651
I have really gotta run.
I'm running late.

06:19.860 --> 06:23.113
I have to call my friend at the museum
to get tickets for that Seurat exhibit.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.784
- I just hope it's not sold out.
- Well, if it is, que Seurat Seurat.

06:27.951 --> 06:29.578
Yeah, that was funnier the first time.

06:29.745 --> 06:31.371
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:33.582 --> 06:35.000
What happened to Cassandra?

06:35.208 --> 06:36.960
Obviously, he dumped her
for someone better.

06:37.169 --> 06:39.504
I haven't dumped anyone.

06:39.713 --> 06:41.298
You mean you're dating
both of them?

06:41.506 --> 06:43.884
Oh, no, I didn't intend to.
It's just that, well...

06:44.051 --> 06:46.386
I ran into Faye. I was about to tell her
about Cassandra.

06:46.553 --> 06:48.805
It's just that we were enjoying
our coffee so much

06:48.972 --> 06:52.559
that coffee turned into dinner,
and then dinner turned into drinks,

06:52.726 --> 06:58.482
and then drinks turned into,
well, coffee again.

06:59.524 --> 07:03.028
Damn, I completely forgot
I rescheduled squash with Niles.

07:03.737 --> 07:06.448
Don't be angry at me
for still being in my robe.

07:07.198 --> 07:09.200
I won't. I wish I were in mine.

07:09.409 --> 07:11.369
Cassandra, what a surprise.

07:11.578 --> 07:14.080
- I brought you some pastries.
- Isn't that thoughtful of you?

07:14.247 --> 07:16.624
- Here we are.
- Hi, Martin, Dixie.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.209
Cassandra! It's...

07:18.418 --> 07:20.628
You know, I'd love it
if you could stay.

07:20.795 --> 07:22.797
I've got to go pick up my brother
for squash.

07:22.964 --> 07:26.509
- Morning, all.
- Well, isn't that a timesaver.

07:27.635 --> 07:29.637
You know, I've still gotta go
get dressed anyway.

07:29.804 --> 07:31.764
And I'll just see you
back at the station.

07:31.931 --> 07:34.267
- Okay. All right. Have a good game.
- All right. Bye.

07:34.434 --> 07:36.936
Oh, you know, I'll just use
the powder room before I go.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.980
Yeah.

07:40.023 --> 07:42.400
This is a disaster!

07:43.443 --> 07:45.236
- What is?
- Hi, Niles.

07:45.445 --> 07:47.655
Oh, I'm up to speed.

07:52.869 --> 07:55.079
- Morning.
- Well, I guess I'll just be...

07:56.247 --> 07:58.332
- What?
- We just noticed:

07:58.499 --> 08:01.586
There's a nest of baby hummingbirds
on the balcony,

08:02.837 --> 08:05.840
and we're just keeping
our voices down. You run along.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.884
Hummingbirds made it
to the 19th floor?

08:08.050 --> 08:12.096
Yes, well, they're
Himalayan mountain hummers.

08:12.263 --> 08:17.310
- They're very rare. Bye-bye.
- Okay. I'll see you later.

08:22.356 --> 08:25.401
- What are you doing?
- I was just standing guard.

08:25.568 --> 08:28.446
You know, the door is...
The lock's broken on it.

08:28.613 --> 08:32.616
Sometimes Dad
just wanders in, you know.

08:33.491 --> 08:34.994
Well, I know you've got your game.

08:35.202 --> 08:36.871
- I'll just get out of your hair.
- Right.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.289
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Bye.

08:39.498 --> 08:41.375
Aren't I gonna get a hug first?
Come on.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.626
Oh, of course.

08:43.836 --> 08:44.920
Are you all right?

08:45.087 --> 08:49.216
Oh, yes. It's just, you're so hard
to say goodbye to.

08:51.635 --> 08:53.345
Well, time's a-wasting. Off you go.

08:54.054 --> 08:56.932
- Bye-bye.
- All right.

09:00.894 --> 09:03.022
Got any more hiding
in the grotto, Hef?

09:04.023 --> 09:05.733
Oh, for God's sakes.

09:05.899 --> 09:08.319
Oh, I'm just not up
to this sort of thing.

09:08.485 --> 09:10.904
What made me think I could juggle?

09:11.113 --> 09:14.324
I sure as hell don't know. You couldn't
catch a balloon till you were 10.

09:16.326 --> 09:18.328
Yes, thank you, Dad.

09:18.537 --> 09:19.788
My problem is that each of them

09:19.955 --> 09:22.207
appeals to different sides
of my personality.

09:22.374 --> 09:26.670
Faye is artistic and cerebral
and cultured.

09:26.837 --> 09:30.507
And Cassandra is passionate
and fun and spontaneous.

09:30.716 --> 09:32.259
Well, my vote sure goes
for Cassandra.

09:32.426 --> 09:34.303
Oh, you would say that.

09:34.511 --> 09:36.263
Any young woman who shows you
any attention,

09:36.430 --> 09:39.391
you're ready to sign
over your pension cheque.

09:39.558 --> 09:42.144
- I think he should go for Faye.
- Oh, Faye, Faye.

09:42.311 --> 09:46.857
If he wants some boring, artsy-fartsy
conversation he's got Niles.

09:50.819 --> 09:52.779
Yes, well, my point is
I am really torn here.

09:52.946 --> 09:56.032
I feel as if I honestly cannot choose.

09:56.241 --> 09:58.952
I think I might be able
to help you with this.

09:59.411 --> 10:01.621
Heads, it's Faye. Tails, Cassandra.

10:01.830 --> 10:06.084
Oh, this is the sort of thing that makes
a woman feel really special.

10:06.585 --> 10:09.421
You're gonna flip a coin? The decision
cannot be made that simply.

10:09.588 --> 10:11.006
It's not gonna be that simple.

10:11.214 --> 10:12.883
The chances of Niles
catching that quarter

10:13.049 --> 10:15.260
- are about the same as you...
- Enough, Dad!

10:17.929 --> 10:22.559
Just go with me on this, Frasier.
Heads, it's Faye. Tails, Cassandra.

10:28.606 --> 10:30.734
And the winner is...

10:30.900 --> 10:34.070
Admit it. You want me
to say one name more than the other.

10:34.988 --> 10:36.906
Niles, you're right, I do. Cassandra.

10:37.115 --> 10:38.867
Yes!

10:39.993 --> 10:42.036
- There you have it.
- Thank you. Thank you, Niles.

10:42.203 --> 10:44.247
Well, what a relief.

10:44.414 --> 10:48.334
You know, my life was perfectly happy
before Faye came back, you know.

10:48.501 --> 10:52.005
Yes, it's Cassandra. She's the one.

10:52.171 --> 10:55.842
Next time I see Faye,
I'll just have to tell her it's over.

10:56.217 --> 10:58.886
Oh, gosh, Niles, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid we've lost our court again.

10:59.053 --> 11:00.680
Do you mind rescheduling
just once more?

11:00.888 --> 11:03.349
- All right, that's fine.
- I gotta hand it to you, Frasier.

11:03.558 --> 11:05.560
You had a tough decision to make
but you made it.

11:05.727 --> 11:09.439
Heck, I can't even decide whether to
have the strawberry or the grape jelly.

11:09.605 --> 11:11.149
Dad, I still have my trusty quarter.

11:11.315 --> 11:13.609
Let's say heads, grape.
Tails, strawberry.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.490
Niles, Niles!

11:19.657 --> 11:21.909
Are you all right?

11:26.372 --> 11:29.667
You gotta wonder what goes on
on that squash court.

11:33.587 --> 11:35.256
You know what I could go for
this morning?

11:35.423 --> 11:37.049
A big old Spanish omelette.

11:37.216 --> 11:39.635
Here's your bran flakes.

11:40.428 --> 11:41.470
What's that?

11:41.679 --> 11:43.931
Your yellow bowl broke
in the dishwasher.

11:44.140 --> 11:46.350
- Well, don't you have another one?
- Afraid not.

11:46.559 --> 11:50.521
Well, red, yellow,
what difference does it make?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.066
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sorry.

12:01.699 --> 12:03.492
Oh, hot.

12:08.205 --> 12:12.710
You know, I don't like this red bowl.
It's throwing everything off.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.297
You know, I think we do have
another yellow bowl.

12:17.464 --> 12:20.050
Why don't you go and sit down,
and I'll fetch it for you?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.635
Okay.

12:23.303 --> 12:25.722
Back off. I need this.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.267
Oh, good morning, Dad.

12:28.434 --> 12:30.269
Everything go all right
with Faye last night?

12:30.435 --> 12:32.604
She didn't take the breakup
too hard, did she?

12:32.813 --> 12:34.982
- Not really.
- Well, I'm sure she realises,

12:35.148 --> 12:37.734
pretty as she is,
that she won't be alone for long.

12:38.944 --> 12:40.571
Good morning, Martin.

12:40.779 --> 12:42.781
What'd I tell you?

12:42.990 --> 12:44.366
Hi, how you doing?

12:44.533 --> 12:45.742
I'll get this.

12:45.951 --> 12:47.536
I had an incredible time last night.

12:47.703 --> 12:49.413
Me too.

12:50.330 --> 12:53.959
Morning, all. Oh, forget it.

12:59.047 --> 13:01.049
- Niles.
- Frasier.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.844
I'm glad you're here. Listen,
I am so sorry about this morning.

13:04.010 --> 13:07.430
Oh, not at all. I ended up playing
an exhilarating game with Chip Emory.

13:07.639 --> 13:08.890
Won two out of three sets.

13:09.099 --> 13:11.601
And if you recall, Chip
was club champion four years running.

13:11.768 --> 13:16.189
Yes, and I also recall that that record
comes with an asterisk.

13:16.356 --> 13:20.819
I believe his streak was interrupted
by World War II.

13:24.864 --> 13:26.866
It was Korea, and you know it.

13:27.450 --> 13:29.035
Can I have my usual, please?

13:29.244 --> 13:30.996
Why was Faye at your apartment
this morning?

13:31.162 --> 13:33.206
Well, actually, I almost made
a terrible mistake.

13:33.373 --> 13:35.625
Last night, I was prepared
to break things off with her,

13:35.792 --> 13:38.503
then we fell into this marvellous
conversation about architecture.

13:38.670 --> 13:41.172
And as it turns out,
she detests the design

13:41.339 --> 13:43.466
of the Bilbao Art Museum
as much as I do.

13:43.675 --> 13:46.511
- And you almost let her go.
- Yes, exactly.

13:46.678 --> 13:49.722
And, well, you know,
Cassandra's a wonderful woman, but...

13:49.889 --> 13:53.184
Well, Faye and I
have a deeper connection

13:53.351 --> 13:56.604
and to be fair, actually,
she was the first

13:56.771 --> 14:01.317
to plant her flag on "terra Frasier."

14:04.529 --> 14:07.031
I'm starting to think Napoleon
had a Frasier complex.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.825
Yes, all right.

14:09.951 --> 14:11.369
Oh, there's Cassandra.

14:11.536 --> 14:13.538
I asked her here for coffee.
I was gonna tell her

14:13.704 --> 14:15.456
- that we can't see each other.
- Good luck.

14:15.623 --> 14:16.874
Thank you. Thank you, Niles.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.501
- Cassandra?
- Hi, honey.

14:18.668 --> 14:20.294
Hi.

14:21.963 --> 14:23.256
Double espresso, please.

14:23.422 --> 14:25.132
- I have great news.
- Really?

14:25.299 --> 14:27.927
Those new promos
are working wonders.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.929
I just got the numbers,
and you're scoring

14:30.096 --> 14:33.558
with women between the ages
of 25 and 49.

14:33.766 --> 14:36.519
Well, that's not always a good thing.

14:37.812 --> 14:38.854
You all right?

14:39.021 --> 14:44.610
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about our relationship.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.988
- You see, l...
- I know where we're going.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.324
A serious talk.

14:51.492 --> 14:53.494
You see, there comes a time
in every relationship

14:53.661 --> 14:55.454
- when you have to decide...
- I know.

14:55.663 --> 14:57.414
Whether we're going
to be exclusive or not.

14:57.581 --> 14:59.625
I've been wanting
to talk to you about that too.

14:59.834 --> 15:02.586
- You have?
- Yes, you see...

15:02.795 --> 15:05.381
I thought you should know
that I've been seeing someone else.

15:06.882 --> 15:08.342
Really?

15:08.551 --> 15:09.593
Does that bother you?

15:09.802 --> 15:13.264
No. No, no, no, actually, not at all.

15:13.973 --> 15:15.224
Oh, good.

15:15.391 --> 15:17.267
Anyway, what I wanted to say
was that...

15:17.434 --> 15:20.437
Well, how long you been seeing
this other fellow?

15:21.146 --> 15:22.940
Not very long.
You're not upset, are you?

15:23.107 --> 15:25.442
No, no, no. Actually,
I was about to say...

15:25.651 --> 15:27.820
Well, what does he do?

15:28.028 --> 15:30.072
He owns his own
venture-capital firm.

15:30.239 --> 15:32.699
Although he spends most of his time
racing sailboats

15:32.866 --> 15:35.577
and rebuilding trails
for the Sierra Club.

15:35.786 --> 15:38.497
Oh, really?
Seems a little unfocused, doesn't he?

15:40.707 --> 15:43.669
- You are upset, aren't you?
- No, no, no.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.964
Really, there's no reason
to be jealous of Sloane.

15:48.173 --> 15:52.511
Believe me,
I am not jealous of Sloane.

15:53.637 --> 15:56.473
If anything, I pity the man
who has to go through life

15:56.640 --> 15:58.016
with a pretentious name like that.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.977
- Frasier.
- All right, fine, fine.

16:01.186 --> 16:03.772
You know what,
let's just drop the whole thing, all right?

16:03.980 --> 16:06.149
Okay. Now,
about those new promos...

16:06.358 --> 16:09.569
- Cassandra, I want us to be exclusive.
- What?

16:09.778 --> 16:11.154
Yes, well, I'm the kind of person

16:11.321 --> 16:13.406
who can make a decision
and commit to it.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.284
And I was hoping that you might be
that sort of person too.

16:16.493 --> 16:19.496
Oh, Frasier, I'm so touched.

16:19.663 --> 16:22.290
If you only want us
to be with each other, that's great.

16:22.457 --> 16:26.294
I was supposed to see Sloane tonight,
but I'm gonna call him and cancel.

16:26.503 --> 16:28.255
Oh, that's wonderful.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.466
Oh, my God. That means
we can spend the night together.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.074

16:42.936 --> 16:46.272
Looks like she took the news well.
Are you insane?

16:46.773 --> 16:49.192
Niles, I almost made
a terrible mistake.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.443
What could have happened

16:50.610 --> 16:52.779
in the last four minutes
to make you change your mind?

16:52.946 --> 16:55.281
When Cassandra told me
that she was seeing somebody else,

16:55.448 --> 16:56.908
it awakened something in me.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.202
- Oh, petty jealousy?
- No.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.454
The realisation that I couldn't bear
to lose her.

17:01.663 --> 17:03.665
The minute you see Faye,
you'll reverse again.

17:03.831 --> 17:07.627
No. No, I won't. I'll prove it to you.

17:07.835 --> 17:11.714
Cassandra is the one. I'm sure of it.

17:14.217 --> 17:15.259
Her machine.

17:15.843 --> 17:18.054
Yes, Faye, it's Frasier.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.891
Listen, I won't be able to join you
for dinner tonight.

17:22.058 --> 17:26.061
But perhaps you could call me later.

17:26.229 --> 17:28.314
We need to talk.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.901
There, I've done it.

17:32.443 --> 17:36.197
Nothing says it's over between us
quite like the phrase:

17:36.364 --> 17:37.782
"We need to talk."

17:38.783 --> 17:41.202
That was my problem, actually.
I kept leaving the door open.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.329
- I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you, Niles.

17:43.537 --> 17:46.832
An enlightened man is he
who can learn from his mistakes.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.042
Squash tomorrow morning?

17:48.250 --> 17:50.336
- 9 a.m., my place?
- See you there.

17:54.632 --> 17:59.720
Well, I called him.
I probably should feel guilty.

17:59.887 --> 18:01.722
I'm just so glad
it's just the two of us now.

18:01.889 --> 18:03.599
I'm ecstatic.

18:03.808 --> 18:06.477
I know a cute little bed-and-breakfast
we can go to this weekend.

18:06.644 --> 18:08.145
Oh, really?

18:08.312 --> 18:09.522
Thank you.

18:10.147 --> 18:13.275
<i>What a relief this is.
I've made my choice.</i>

18:13.776 --> 18:16.737
<i>Look at her. I've found an angel.</i>

18:19.949 --> 18:23.035
<i>An angel who wears
an awful lot of makeup.</i>

18:23.202 --> 18:24.578
<i>I've never noticed that before.</i>

18:24.745 --> 18:27.373
<i>Faye doesn't paint her face up
like that.</i>

18:27.539 --> 18:31.627
And they have the cutest
little four-poster beds in each room.

18:31.835 --> 18:33.796
That sounds lovely.

18:33.962 --> 18:37.591
<i>My, she uses the word "cute" a lot.</i>

18:37.800 --> 18:41.970
<i>I'm cute. This cafe is cute.
Now the bed is cute.</i>

18:42.137 --> 18:46.099
<i>Faye used the word
"jejune" last night.</i>

18:48.018 --> 18:50.354
Oh, you know, I meant to tell you.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.440
I really liked how you handled
that nasty caller yesterday.

18:53.607 --> 18:55.400
It was such a clever way...

18:55.567 --> 18:59.738
<i>God, all she talks about
is work, work, work.</i>

18:59.905 --> 19:02.574
<i>And now I'll see her
every morning before work,</i>

19:02.741 --> 19:05.369
<i>and at work, and after work.</i>

19:05.535 --> 19:08.372
<i>I feel trapped.</i>

19:08.538 --> 19:10.957
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

19:11.124 --> 19:14.711
<i>Wait, what are you doing?
It's just your fear talking.</i>

19:14.878 --> 19:18.715
<i>She's a wonderful woman.
She's the one. She's perfect.</i>

19:18.882 --> 19:23.762
And then I ran into Roz after the show,
and she told me the cutest little story...

19:23.970 --> 19:27.390
Cassandra, we need to talk.

19:33.021 --> 19:35.523
- Frasier?
- Faye, hi.

19:35.982 --> 19:38.276
- We really need to talk.
- I know, I got your message.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.738
- I thought you couldn't see me tonight.
- Well, I had some unfinished business

19:41.905 --> 19:46.409
with the Promotions Department,
but that's all done now.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.828
I wish you would've called.
I would've put something on.

19:48.995 --> 19:50.622
No, no, you look beautiful.

19:50.789 --> 19:56.127
Listen, Faye,
I want us to be exclusive.

19:57.086 --> 19:58.129
What?

19:58.338 --> 20:00.507
Yes, I wanna take our relationship
to the next level.

20:00.673 --> 20:02.967
I just wanna be with you.

20:04.219 --> 20:05.762
I'm a little surprised.

20:05.929 --> 20:07.972
You said, "We need to talk"
on the machine,

20:08.139 --> 20:10.767
and, you know,
that usually means it's over.

20:10.975 --> 20:13.978
Really? I had no idea.

20:15.355 --> 20:17.148
Well, this is wonderful.

20:17.357 --> 20:18.900
Oh, my God.

20:19.067 --> 20:22.278
Oh, God, so it's just you and me.

20:22.445 --> 20:23.905
God, this is exhilarating.

20:24.072 --> 20:26.157
Oh, this is turning out
to be the best day ever.

20:26.365 --> 20:29.035
Because... Well, okay,
Chris McKenna, the restaurant critic,

20:29.243 --> 20:31.078
he comes over to the restaurant
this morning...

20:31.245 --> 20:37.251
<i>What is she thinking
with that ridiculous shirt? Tie-dye?</i>

20:37.418 --> 20:40.463
<i>Stop it, Frasier.
You can't do this to yourself.</i>

20:40.630 --> 20:43.174
<i>This is nothing more
than the natural panic</i>

20:43.341 --> 20:44.926
<i>of finally making your choice.</i>

20:45.092 --> 20:46.594
- That the printer had messed up

20:46.802 --> 20:50.097
and the menu said "flab"
instead of "flan."

20:51.307 --> 20:53.476
That is so precious.

20:53.684 --> 20:55.561
<i>And so is she.</i>

20:56.103 --> 20:59.357
<i>Precious. My Faye.</i>

20:59.982 --> 21:03.527
<i>Faye as in favourite.</i>

21:03.694 --> 21:06.447
<i>This feels so much better
now that I've relaxed.</i>

21:06.614 --> 21:08.407
<i>I was about to doom
this whole relationship</i>

21:08.574 --> 21:10.493
<i>with my neurotic nitpicking.</i>

21:10.659 --> 21:12.745
<i>But it's clear sailing now.</i>

21:12.912 --> 21:14.830
Well, enough about me.
How was your day?

21:14.997 --> 21:18.667
Well, it certainly ended well.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.879
Although, you know, something funny
did happen at the station.

21:22.046 --> 21:24.256
It was during the second hour
of my show.

21:24.465 --> 21:27.718
<i>My God, he really does love
to talk about himself.</i>

21:28.886 --> 21:34.141
<i>Is that another new pair of shoes?
He's got more shoes than I do.</i>

21:34.308 --> 21:36.226
- Didn't really work out, but...
