WEBVTT

00:19.820 --> 00:22.090
TOLBECK: Say, can I ask you
a personal question?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.725
Why not?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.394
Do you ever wear
your work shoes

00:26.427 --> 00:28.129
on the weekends?

00:28.162 --> 00:32.400
Why are none of your personal
questions actually personal?

00:32.433 --> 00:35.369
Well, the question is about
your personal life,

00:35.403 --> 00:38.406
so it is
a personal question.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.408
FATIMA :
Car 27. Please report. Car 27.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.144
No, no, no, it's me,
for me, for me, for me.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.379
Car 27.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.215
Hey, how arFATIMA: Fine.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.284
So, no activity, I presume?

00:50.318 --> 00:51.519
CULLEN:
Uh, no activity.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.187
Copy that, dispatch out.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.260
Thought you said
the date went well.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.828
Uh, the date went
Really?ly well.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.430
If anything,
it went too well.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.132
Really? 'Cause it didn't
sound like it.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.167
Oh, no, she's just--
it's a little awkward

01:06.200 --> 01:07.701
back and forth.
She's being coy and...

01:07.735 --> 01:09.270
professional, you know.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.439
This is phase two.
This is the... you know,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.441
this is the dance we do.
I'm loving this.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.775
Yeah, yeah.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.145
Oh, man, I mean...uh?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.713
All I can say is, was Venus
in retrograde last night?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.249
I'm thinking it was.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.583
You don't believe
in astrology.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.319
: After last night,
Wow.lieve in anything.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.488
Yeah. Yeah.
It was good.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.290
I couldn't believe it.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.492
If I could get
a memory abortion, I would.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.594
Yep..

01:33.627 --> 01:35.196
So, I booked us
a table for two

01:35.229 --> 01:37.465
Oh.Señor Siam.

01:37.498 --> 01:41.169
Kind of place I wouldn't be
caught dead in.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.336
We're looking at
the menus, and I go,

01:42.370 --> 01:44.672
"Um, here's
a fun game,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.607
why don't we order
for each other?"

01:46.640 --> 01:48.742
And I've ordered him
the dry curry

01:48.776 --> 01:50.878
because he will not shut up
about it--

01:50.911 --> 01:53.314
how it's the hottest dish
in San Diego,

01:53.347 --> 01:54.815
but he can take it.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.717
Well, I was
talking about it to?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.719
and I think she kind of
knew I wanted to eat it.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.421
He takes one bite of it,

02:00.454 --> 02:02.590
and is, like, sweating.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.425
I'm not gonna lie, I was
sweating a little bit.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.826
It was pretty hot.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.361
Breathing really heavy.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.896
He gets really red
e,

02:08.929 --> 02:11.765
and his eyes are bulging,
and he's, like, quivering.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.901
And the waiter comes over, he's
like, "Have some coconut cream."

02:13.934 --> 02:15.503
I'm like, "No, no, no,
I don't need that."

02:15.536 --> 02:17.438
And takes another mouthful
of the dry curry,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.207
and we go through
the whole thing again.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.475
Yeah, it gets worse.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.743
We leave the
restaurant, okay,

02:22.776 --> 02:24.445
and we take a taxi
Mmm. to her place.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.514
And I'm thinking,
"Yes, finally."

02:26.547 --> 02:27.881
But he wants to walk me in,

02:27.915 --> 02:29.917
and I'm like,
"No, I'm tired."

02:29.950 --> 02:32.486
I give him the spiel,
like, "I work in the morning."

02:32.520 --> 02:34.222
The next thing I know,
I turn around,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.789
he's paying the cab fare.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.858
And we walk up to her
Mm-hmm.g, you know.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.493
And we go inside.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.395
The minute we walk in the door,

02:41.429 --> 02:44.865
I get this terrible rumble
in my stomach.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.900
Uh

02:46.934 --> 02:48.502
Yeah.

02:48.536 --> 02:51.505
From the Massaman burrito
Oh...dered me.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.973
She goes straight
into the bathroom,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.908
and she's in there for,
like, 20, 25 minutes.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.279
Just vomiting, and, like,
retching, just getting it out,

02:58.312 --> 03:00.381
and it's... ugh.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.882
I mean, she must've been
fixing everything up

03:01.915 --> 03:03.584
and getting all
Uh-huh.ff ready.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.419
I don't know what she
Yeah.oing in there.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.820
But my mind
was going crazy.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.357
Honestly, I'm thinking,
at least, silver lining:

03:09.390 --> 03:12.393
he's probably gone.
Like, who would wait for,

03:12.426 --> 03:14.595
like, a half an hour,
while I'm vomiting?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.797
. He waits.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.566
I open the door,
and he's still there.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.435
And she looks...
pretty good.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.437
And, uh, then just in
case I did get this far,

03:23.471 --> 03:26.307
I wore my special
T-shirt, under my shirt.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.975
I bought it for this,
Mm-hmm.en's march.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.910
I didn't go on the march,
but I kept the T-shirt.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.812
And then, he...

03:31.845 --> 03:33.547
What

03:33.581 --> 03:35.716
He starts unbuttoning
his shirt,

03:35.749 --> 03:39.920
and his T-shirt...
underneath, it says...

03:39.953 --> 03:41.722
"This is what a
feminist looks like."

03:41.755 --> 03:43.324
Get out of town.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.393
:
Whoa. Whoa.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.960
CULLEN: And we start

03:46.994 --> 03:48.962
making out, you know. We're
going like frisky teenagers,

03:48.996 --> 03:50.531
Mm-hmm.going for it.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.801
All I can remember is, like,
his tongue.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.603
And it was like
a German Shepherd,

03:55.636 --> 03:58.339
like, licking an ice cream cone.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.607
But she's like,
"You know what?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.475
I'm kind of tired."
So, uh, I say,

04:01.509 --> 04:03.311
"Let's just take
it slow, okay?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.613
We've got a long road ahead,
we've got a lot of time."

04:05.646 --> 04:07.748
"We spent a lot of time
tonight in Head Town.

04:07.781 --> 04:11.552
"I can feel that we're on the
way to Heart Town. You know?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.321
So let's take all the
stops along the way."

04:13.354 --> 04:15.889
'Cause all roads
ck Town.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.891
Am I right? Yeah!

04:17.925 --> 04:21.429
Oh, buddy, I'm going
to Fuck Town. Yeah.come!

04:21.462 --> 04:25.466
It was literally
the worst date

04:25.499 --> 04:28.669
I have ever been on.
The worst.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.771
Anyway, we're gonna go to
Fuck...wn, I can feel it.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.341
Yeah. Thanks, man., man.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.576
Oh.ICE: Car 27, come in. Car 27?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.678
Yeah, this is 27.
Go ahead. Over.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.880
Yup, just checking in on him.

04:39.913 --> 04:40.881
Him?

04:40.914 --> 04:42.015
Mason.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.054
Oh. Yeah, he's fine.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.822
He's doing good.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.361
("Happiness, Missouri"
by El Vy playing)

04:53.394 --> 04:57.365
* While away while
someone counts the minutes *

04:57.398 --> 05:01.702
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off *

05:01.735 --> 05:05.373
* By the way,
I told you we were in this *

05:05.406 --> 05:09.477
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off it. *

05:09.510 --> 05:11.512
*

05:35.969 --> 05:38.439
Nice work.
Pretty good hole.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.974
I mean, we knocked that
out of the park.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.676
That's a Rolls-Royce
of holes.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.446
Yeah, we made
pretty good time.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.916
And they're sending some guy
to look at it later tonight.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.852
I don't know, this
guy Pat the Rat.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.521
He's coming by to
inspect the hole.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.855
Remember I told you that?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.124
Okay, well, he better keep
his mouth shut, okay?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.992
'Cause we...
we dug a red-hot hole.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.128
I don't want anyone
talkin' shit about it.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.663
Okay.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.532
What else did I tell you?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.467
Who are you?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.101
:
You're Marco.m Marco.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.770
Si. No. No.rco.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.005
Don't do the voice.
You're No.t Marco.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.875
If they ask you who you are,
No, I was thinking about...

06:14.908 --> 06:16.877
But I, but I want to...
I kind of want to do

06:16.910 --> 06:18.612
a broken English-Italian
hybrid, you know.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.081
: My grandpa,
he drive a gondola. Si.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.484
Si. I'm Marco. :
And then they just move on.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.886
Like, "Oh, don't talk
to Marco, you talk to this guy."

06:25.919 --> 06:29.890
Don't do that. Just be
Marco in your normal voice.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.159
Why? You don't need
Because they hired

06:32.192 --> 06:36.764
me and Marco, so that's who
they expect to be doing the job.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.899
But if they expect
to meet Marco and they meet me,

06:38.932 --> 06:40.468
they're gonna be like,
"God, this guy

06:40.501 --> 06:42.202
is wa more fun
than Marco."

06:42.235 --> 06:45.706
It's not a competition
about who's more fun.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.007
I know.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.776
I'm way more fun than Marco.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.578
Look, they will
kill us...

06:50.611 --> 06:53.614
both... if you're not
Marco, if they find out

06:53.647 --> 06:55.182
that someone else is here,
do you understand?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.650
They will kill us both.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.620
Okay. Fine.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.921
:
I'll be Marco

07:00.954 --> 07:02.523
:
with a normal voice.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.058
:
Marco. I'll be Marco.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.896
Can I just affect it
that way? I'm Marco.

07:08.929 --> 07:13.066
You're really... you're really
starting to frustrate me here.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.035
Can we meet halfway?

07:15.068 --> 07:18.205
I won't say a word,
but I just get...

07:18.238 --> 07:21.174
I get an internal monologue.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.144
I'm not saying this.
I'm only thinking this.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.680
: Please,
don't ask Marco a question.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.616
His English not so good.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.954
*

07:33.987 --> 07:37.090
ROBERTO: Sorry I had to rest.
Another migraine.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.793
It's cool, man. It's good
for my journey, you know?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.963
Overcame migraines
and gonorrhea,

07:42.996 --> 07:46.834
while digging his way
to America and fame and fortune.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.703
I like that about you.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.871
You're very confident, cabrón.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.273
Just got to bYou do.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.808
It's all possible.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.577
I'm gonna be
a successful comedian.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.812
Be on the talk shows,
"Hey, how are you?"

07:58.846 --> 08:00.548
"I'm fine."

08:00.581 --> 08:02.082
And win an Oscar

08:02.115 --> 08:05.285
and have a beautiful entourage.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.254
Oh, the-the life.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.123
The life, cabrón.
I wish that for you.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.593
I don't think

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
that comedians
win Oscars, though.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.997
Sure, they do.
Acting's the easy bit.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.100
Nah. No, I don't think
that's true, cabrón.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.869
Sure it is.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.671
Do you know the acting test?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.739
Uh, there's an acting test?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.608
Saying "I love you"
to someone...

08:27.641 --> 08:29.710
and being believed.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.245
You do that, you're an actor.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.281
Yeah. Come on.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.283
go. You try it.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.318
No, seriously,
let me hear it.not my...

08:38.351 --> 08:39.587
No, I'm shy, cabrón.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.088
All right.it a shot.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.624
I love you, eh?

08:43.657 --> 08:45.292
That was terrible.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.227
Come on, really.
I was just shy.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.797
Throw it away.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.300
I guess I love yNo.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.769

09:06.213 --> 09:07.648
Because I don't believe you.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.050
Roberto, I love you.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.262
it's hard. Y

09:22.295 --> 09:23.964
You sI will.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.567
Give me a second.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.583
I love you.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.988
That was very powerful,
cabrón.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.358
Yeah. That was acting.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.293
You just shake it off like this?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.697
It was, like, deep inside.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.398
I feel really close to you
right now.

09:58.431 --> 10:02.169
No. You don't have to get weird
about it. It was just acting.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.837
Yeah.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.973
Well, I love you, too.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.374
Yeah, I don't love you.
I was acting.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.177
That'Okay.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.012
Or do I?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.849
*

10:15.883 --> 10:18.852
JANICE: You can't put Mason
in a hotel room overnight.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.121
Because he's a 15-year-old boy,
that's why.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.123
We'll talk about this
when I get home.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.960
Daryl?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.996
Yeah, my fiancé Daryl.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.698
What abouthome.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.701
the well

10:33.734 --> 10:34.935
It was all Mason.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.203
Yeah. He masterminded

10:36.236 --> 10:37.805
the entire thing.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.139
What he did was
he tracked down

10:39.172 --> 10:40.741
Uh-huh. ex-wife Brandi...

10:40.774 --> 10:42.409
...who's in Las Colinas,
doing five years.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.012
So, what he does is
he goes to jail,

10:45.045 --> 10:47.848
tells her that he's doing
a podcast for a school project.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.717
Right? And that
Oh, God. a break...

10:49.750 --> 10:51.384
...in the case that might
prove her innocence.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.887
So, Brandi's telling him all
sorts of things about Daryl--

10:53.921 --> 10:55.355
Mm-hmm.sonal life...

10:55.388 --> 10:57.891
...all this crazy stuff
that he was into, you know.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.893
And, of course,
Mason's all ears.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.462
I mean, she's telling him stuff
Of course.ld never...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.031
...tell a 15-year-old boy.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.734
So, he's taking this
information and he's going

11:06.767 --> 11:08.301
on these gay online chat rooms,

11:08.335 --> 11:09.469
posing as DYeah.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.004
And he convinced a man

11:11.038 --> 11:13.306
who lives on the other side
Mm-hmm.country...

11:13.340 --> 11:16.744
...that he was a gay man, had
him come all the way over here,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.411
and fall in love with him.
And to--

11:18.445 --> 11:20.447
I mean,
to leave his entire family?

11:20.480 --> 11:23.283
I mean, tell me, what other
15-year-old boy do you know

11:23.316 --> 11:25.185
that could pull
something like that off?

11:25.218 --> 11:28.756
Yeah, but what about
Daryl and Mason?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.257
Mm. are they getting along?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.792
Yeah, there's a
lot of tension,

11:31.825 --> 11:33.460
and, you know,

11:33.493 --> 11:36.463
Daryl's always accusing Mason
of being insane.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.165
Says, "He's the devil,

11:38.198 --> 11:39.900
he's a demon,
ruined my lYeah.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.069
"He needs to go to a
psychiatric hospital."

11:42.102 --> 11:45.038
All that kind of stuff.
I mean, I love the guy,

11:45.072 --> 11:46.439
but he just focuses
on the little things,

11:46.473 --> 11:49.076
and he has just... issues
with just letting things go.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.911
You know? And it builds up
and it creates stress.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.780
I think it's time
he sees a shrink.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.214
Mason?

11:54.247 --> 11:55.883
Daryl. Are you even
listening to me?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.417
Why would Mason go see a shrink?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.887
Um...

11:59.920 --> 12:00.988
Bing bong.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.829
ADRIAN:
I got it. Yeah, fine.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.364
I'll just be Marco.
I'm just Marco.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.133
I don't say a word.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.102
Maybe I give a look?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.104
I'll make sure

12:17.137 --> 12:19.506
I check in
with you though. Yeah.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.109
And since we're doing
each other's favors,

12:22.142 --> 12:26.446
I want to get your advice
on a problem I'm having.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.315
No.it about my mom?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.250
In fact, it isn't.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.853
It's about this "woman."

12:32.886 --> 12:36.990
Adrian... I know
you're seeing my mom.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.926
Maybe I'm seeing
another woman.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.862
You can't just say
"another woman,"

12:41.895 --> 12:44.231
when I know you're
talking about my mom.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.267
This woman, all right...

12:47.300 --> 12:48.335
My mom?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.370
It's a woman I'm seeing.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.541
She happens to have one foot
that's larger than the other.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.010
And, oddly enough,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.880
I find it strangely arousing.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.514
Very arousing.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.884
She's a little ashamed by it.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.186
And I'm just... I don't want
to embarrass her.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.388
And, yet, if there's some way
we could... we could

13:08.421 --> 13:10.390
kind of bring it
into the discussion,

13:10.423 --> 13:13.260
we could be so much stronger.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.295
Because of it.
Mm.would really help us.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.530
That sounds like
a real pickle.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.032
It really does.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.401
Yeah.one? I heard you.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.403
I heard your problem.
But that's it

13:23.436 --> 13:26.974
No, I don't have any
advice about your...

13:27.007 --> 13:28.508
It's not... problem.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.511
It's podophilia. We prefer
"podophilia." All right?

13:31.544 --> 13:34.147
And I didn't expect to have
this kind of feeling,

13:34.181 --> 13:35.315
but people evolve.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.151
And here's the thing that
really gets me though, you know?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.053
What

13:40.087 --> 13:42.622
Is that your
No. Toes are gross.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.058
How can you be into feet
and not be into toes?

13:45.092 --> 13:48.295
I'm talking
about a beautiful high arch.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.331
How can we idolize and fantasize
about a woman's breast

13:51.364 --> 13:55.202
and yet, the supple high arch
of a woman's foot

13:55.235 --> 13:57.337
is considered weird?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.072
God, even you just doing this

13:59.106 --> 14:01.975
is one of the most disgusting
things I've ever seen.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.644
Okay,

14:04.677 --> 14:09.149
the options that I
Yes. right now are...

14:09.182 --> 14:12.085
A) you're either
cheating on my mom,

14:12.119 --> 14:15.255
B) you're attempting

14:15.288 --> 14:19.526
to get my mom into some
weird foot fetish thing.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.497
I think we broke the code
on who the other woman was.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.665
Right?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.268
This is great.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.669
This is wonderful.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.440
We finally had a little
locker room banter, huh?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.275
I'm not cheating
on your mom.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.676
I'm not.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.646
Well...

14:39.679 --> 14:44.151
I guess, yeah, I-I
really wish you were now.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.293
Hey, Roberto?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.661
Yeah.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.363
How'd you become a comedian?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.131
Well, you don't choose comedy--
that's one thing.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.000
Comedy chooses you.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.670
For me, it started in my
hometown of Guacajuevo.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.673
The weather is
always 74 degrees.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.209
Everything is ripe,
delicious. And we also had

15:09.242 --> 15:13.213
one thing that separated us
from all the other pretty towns:

15:13.246 --> 15:15.148
Ernesto the Crocodile.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.150
Who's Ernesto the Crocodile?

15:17.184 --> 15:19.719
The largest crocodile
you will ever see in your life.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.421
Ernesto

15:21.454 --> 15:23.390
would swim around us.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.493
We had no police,
but, guess what,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.328
we had Ernesto the Crocodile.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.997
And one day,

15:30.030 --> 15:31.999
during the summer equinox,

15:32.032 --> 15:35.435
Ernesto crawled out
of the water.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.038
The townspeople
parted ways, as Ernesto

15:38.071 --> 15:40.407
headed directly to the center
of the town,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.175
where the church bell rang.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.177
Someone summoned
Esmeralda,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.446
the queen of our town.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.049
Esmeralda was
incredible.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.318
She looked 17, 18,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.553
but, really, she was 85.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.055
She wore

15:55.088 --> 15:56.523
Wow.tiful earrings...

15:56.556 --> 15:58.058
...elegant jewels,

15:58.091 --> 15:59.592
long, flowing gowns,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.594
and Crocs.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.330
Ernesto looked up

16:03.363 --> 16:07.134
and saw Esmeralda.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.269
Esmeralda
approached Ernesto,

16:09.302 --> 16:12.739
placed her left hand
on Ernesto's snout.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.075
Suddenly,
Esmeralda said,

16:15.108 --> 16:17.344
"I think...

16:17.377 --> 16:21.681
Ernesto has a message for us."

16:21.714 --> 16:24.217
She leaned in,

16:24.251 --> 16:26.353
carefully at first.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.456
Ernesto opened
his mouth,

16:29.489 --> 16:31.358
rolled out his tongue,

16:31.391 --> 16:34.361
and bit off Esmeralda's head.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.363
I can hear

16:36.396 --> 16:37.597
the crunching now.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.367
Suddenly,

16:40.400 --> 16:43.103
Ernesto went into a death roll.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.604
And if you've ever seen
a death roll on land,

16:44.637 --> 16:47.107
it's much worse
than it is on water.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.309
And the last thing
to disappear

16:49.342 --> 16:50.777
were her feet.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.113
With her Crocs.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.616
And I told my friend Hector,
"Look,

16:56.649 --> 17:00.019
crocodiles are cannibals."

17:02.289 --> 17:04.257
You see? 'Cause
he had swallowed

17:04.291 --> 17:05.792
No, I get it.'s a crocodile.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.360
He laughed.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.096
And then the next person
laughed.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.497
And the mayor laughed.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.666
Suddenly, the whole town
was laughing.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.436
And I knew

17:16.469 --> 17:18.838
I was not a stain remover.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.573
I was a comedian.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.848
Mason? Mason.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.618
Mason!

17:31.651 --> 17:33.853
Okay.!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.122
Mason.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.289
What?

17:36.323 --> 17:37.857
You good?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.459
No, I'm bored.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.128
You're bored?

17:41.161 --> 17:43.163
You're-- this...
You're in a police car.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.265
It's not meant to being.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.434
exciting, we're meant to
be teaching him a lesson.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.536
Really?

17:49.569 --> 17:50.703
That's what you told me.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.472
You organized this
with Janice.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.840
You.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.275
Right.that's right, yeah.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.310
Yeah.s what it's about.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.579
All right, look, Mason,
we don't want

17:59.612 --> 18:01.814
any more
unsavory behavior

18:01.848 --> 18:05.185
vis-à-vis your mom's
boyfriend, okay?

18:05.218 --> 18:08.555
You don't want to end up on the
wrong side of the law, trust me.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.858
'Cause then you gonna have to
run into people like me.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.326
Yeah, that should do it.
Listen, Mason,

18:13.360 --> 18:15.195
just tell your mom we
warned you not to do

18:15.228 --> 18:18.565
any more of the gay catfishing
Internet stuff, okay?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.268
Cool, that project's
finished anyway.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.669
Good.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.205
MASON:
I've got this other one.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.873
I've been milking Daryl's
thermos of coffee

18:26.906 --> 18:28.475
for the past three months.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.611
Homemade creamer.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.880
Wha

18:33.913 --> 18:35.715
You know...

18:35.748 --> 18:38.618
No, I don't. What do you mean,
"homemade creamer"?

18:38.651 --> 18:39.919
You know.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.888
Are you suggesting
that you are

18:41.921 --> 18:44.324
putting your essence
into Daryl's coffee?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.226
Oh...

18:46.259 --> 18:47.894
Will somebody please explain
to me what's going on?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.862
No!s jizzing in his coffee.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.598
Why?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.300
He's a 15-year-old boy,
he doesn't need a reason.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.503
Oh, that is so gross.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.471
And it's got to be
dangerous, too, right?

18:58.505 --> 19:02.442
Probably burn yourself trying
to put it in the coffee.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.345
Well, I doubt he's putting
his dick in the coffee.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.746
I think he's probably...

19:06.779 --> 19:08.881
He's probably jizzing
in the thermos,

19:08.915 --> 19:11.384
and then Daryl's adding
the coffee later.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.552
Is that what
you do, Mason?

19:12.585 --> 19:13.786
Yeah, there you go.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.389
Right. But that still
must be hard--

19:16.423 --> 19:18.758
nailing it into
a thermos every time.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.928
Unless he does it
into a cup first,

19:21.961 --> 19:24.964
and then pours that
into the thermos.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.566
You know what I'm saying?

19:26.599 --> 19:27.667
Like in his room, alone.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.668
Sure.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.337
Is that what you do, Mason?

19:30.370 --> 19:32.405
MASONRight.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.806
Wow.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.775
You must have to get
up early to do that.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.777
You know, to put it in there
before Daryl goes to work.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.680
Right. Though, you could
probably do it late at night.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.682
Oh, yeah-- maybe you
have to set an alarm.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.418
Yeah. Do you set
an alarm, Mason?

19:45.452 --> 19:46.819
MASON:
Yup.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.421
What, like, 2:00,
3:00 in the morning?

19:48.455 --> 19:49.589
Yup.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.957
Wow.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.293
That's ama-- and
th

19:53.326 --> 19:54.561
How many loads is that?

19:54.594 --> 19:58.498
Three months...
90. 90, probably?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.532
68 workdays.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.434
68 workYeah.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.835
Waking up, every night,

20:02.869 --> 20:04.304
Wow.ing an alarm...

20:04.337 --> 20:06.839
...jizzing on cue--
that's dedication.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.842
And, you know, I'm surprised
Daryl hasn't tasted it yet,

20:09.876 --> 20:12.011
Well, maybe
he's used to it....

20:12.044 --> 20:13.513
I'm sure he is
used to it now,

20:13.546 --> 20:15.515
after 68 fucking
workdays.

20:15.548 --> 20:19.018
In fact, I'm sure if Mason
stopped jizzing in his coffee,

20:19.051 --> 20:21.321
it would taste weird
to Daryl now.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.723
It's like when you switch from
whole milk to almond milk.

20:23.756 --> 20:24.824
Know what I mean?t.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.459
Right.d it at first.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.827
Yeah.ow I love it.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.331
And I'm sure Daryl loves
the taste of his coffee.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.832
That's just one project.
I've got...

20:32.865 --> 20:34.867
Okay, fine! Listen, we don't
want to hear any more

20:34.901 --> 20:36.336
of your projects, okay.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.605
Put your headphones on,
will you?

20:38.638 --> 20:42.342
Side note: good detective work
from us, know what I mean?

20:42.375 --> 20:43.743
Good to flex those
muscles again,

20:43.776 --> 20:45.545
Yeah.now what I'm saying?

20:45.578 --> 20:48.281
Yeah. Cracked the case
Yeah.e jizzy teenager.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.798
ADRIAN:
That's not a dude.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.736
Pat the Rat?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.504
Hey, what up?
I'm Marco.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.005
Hey, they should
call you Pat the Babe,

21:13.039 --> 21:14.741
'cause you're more
of a babe than a rat.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.643
Some hole, right?

21:16.676 --> 21:19.646
Yeah. Yeah, Marco
knows his holes,

21:19.679 --> 21:20.780
and that one's top-shelf.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.382
We weren't expecting a woman,

21:22.415 --> 21:23.916
especially one as
attractive as yourself.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.885
Did Marco cross a line?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.356
I'm Marco, by the way.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.891
'Cause Marco, you know,
he likes the ladies.

21:31.924 --> 21:32.925
ANGUS:
Is there a problem?

21:32.959 --> 21:35.628
The hole must be here.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.930
No, no, it said ten from
that wall, ten from this wall.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.999
Ten meters.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.469
Meters? What the
fuck is a meter?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.036
The metric system.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.105
This is America.
W-We use feet.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.007
And it wasn't specified...

21:48.040 --> 21:49.476
Jesus Christ.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.610
There was no
specification.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.012
Now, Marco is
fucked off.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.383
Because I ruined
these jeans.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.719
These are expensive
jeans, I've been told.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.489
And now they're ruined,

22:02.522 --> 22:04.957
so fuck the metric system!

22:07.994 --> 22:09.796
What

22:09.829 --> 22:10.797
ANGUS: Oh...

22:10.830 --> 22:12.699
The metric system

22:12.732 --> 22:16.135
is a thing of beauty.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.639
It is, without a doubt,
the most perfect

22:19.672 --> 22:21.140
measuring arrangement
conceived by man.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.110
ANGUS: Okay, let's all
just calm down.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.678
Ms. Pat, we didn't mean
any disrespect

22:25.712 --> 22:28.448
to the metric system...

22:28.481 --> 22:30.450
You know, it all...
works together

22:30.483 --> 22:32.519
in such perfect symmetry.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.455
It is complex, and yet,

22:35.488 --> 22:36.923
devastatingly simplistic.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.926
It is virtually binary
with its wondrous design

22:39.959 --> 22:42.128
of zeros and ones.

22:42.161 --> 22:46.599
One milliliter of water occupies
one cubic centimeter,

22:46.633 --> 22:49.736
weighs one gram, requires
one calorie of energy

22:49.769 --> 22:52.672
to heat up by one degree
centigrade, which is...

22:52.705 --> 22:54.707
one percent of the difference

22:54.741 --> 22:55.775
between its freezing point
of zero

22:55.808 --> 22:58.478
and its boiling point of 100.

22:58.511 --> 23:02.549
It has, rightfully,
taken over the world,

23:02.582 --> 23:03.716
with the exception
of Burma,

23:03.750 --> 23:06.753
Liberia and the United States.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.155
But beyond that, it is the
official unit of measurement

23:09.188 --> 23:12.492
for this assignment, and it will
not be disrespected.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.862
Okay. Sorry.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.468
Dig the hole.

23:22.935 --> 23:23.903
Fuck.d.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.171
Did you see how crazy that was?

23:25.204 --> 23:26.973
See how hard she slapped me?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.175
Sh-She did not slap you
very hard, Adrian.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.878
She-- but she kind
of jostled me.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.046
You see the jostle,
Okay.orque?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.750
Can we just dig this
new fucking... metric hole?

23:37.784 --> 23:38.918
I guess she pointed
to here.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.920
I'm gonna go get
the fucking jackhammer.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.989
Hey, I love your mom, okay?

23:43.022 --> 23:45.892
But she was banging.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.127
*

23:48.160 --> 23:50.897
JANICE :
Car 27, please report.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.599
Car 27, over.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.667
TOLBECK: He's doing good.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.168
He definitely learned
his lesson.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.236
Right.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.538
CULLEN:
Hey, uh,

23:58.571 --> 23:59.939
Fatima, are you there?

23:59.972 --> 24:01.674
Uh, no, she's not here
at the moment.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.910
CULLEN:
Oh. Okay. Just, uh,

24:03.943 --> 24:05.912
tell her Cullen says hi.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.680
JANICE:
Mm-hmm. Signing out.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.816
Out.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.652
She's probably in the
bathroom or something.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.086
Yeah, I'm sure.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.221
Mm-hmm.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.923
She's not interested in you.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.191
Okay, I don't need
relationship advice from you.

24:19.225 --> 24:21.027
Thanks, Mason.
All right?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.562
If I need anyone
to jizz in a beverage,

24:22.595 --> 24:24.664
you'll be my first
call, I assure you.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.698
But thank you.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.700
I can tell Mom was lying.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.536
Yeah, Fatima was there,

24:29.569 --> 24:30.703
and she didn't want
to speak to you.

24:30.737 --> 24:32.238
Oh, what?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.574
Looks like you're going
to Fuck Town alone. Have fun.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.575
Whoa!fuck you!

24:35.608 --> 24:36.843
MASON: Fuck me?id.

24:36.876 --> 24:38.244
The little shit--
yeah, fuck you!

24:38.277 --> 24:39.946
I'll take him to Fuck Town.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.280
You want to go to
Fuck Town with me?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.215
Two tickets to Fuck
Town, you and me.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.685
Take it easy, now. to Fuck Town.

24:45.718 --> 24:46.886
Yeah, I'll take you to Fuck
Town if you want to go.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.987
I got two tickets.

24:48.020 --> 24:48.855
Whoa, it's an earthquake.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.256
I'll chaperone you
down in Fuck Town.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.024
You feel that?
Oh, fuck me.hquake.

24:55.695 --> 24:58.030
Okay. All right.
Adrian... all right.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.002
Oh, God.Mason!

25:03.035 --> 25:05.104
MIGUEL: Momma.
Hold onto me, cabrón.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.305
I got you, I got you.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.707
Dios mío!

25:07.740 --> 25:08.975
We got to get up there!

25:09.008 --> 25:12.278
ROBERTO: Hold me.
Hold onto me, cabrón. Hold on!

25:12.311 --> 25:13.512
I love you!
