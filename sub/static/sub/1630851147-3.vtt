00:42.125 --> 00:43.833
WATCHER: <i>Time.</i>

00:46.541 --> 00:47.875
<i>Space.</i>

00:49.333 --> 00:50.541
<i>Reality.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:55.541
<i>It's more than a linear path.</i>

00:59.833 --> 01:04.541
<i>It's a prism of endless possibility,</i>

01:06.916 --> 01:10.625
<i>where a single choice</i>
<i>can branch out into infinite realities,</i>

01:13.166 --> 01:16.208
<i>creating alternate worlds</i>
<i>from the ones you know.</i>

01:20.000 --> 01:21.750
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:26.666
<i>I am your guide</i>
<i>through these vast new realities.</i>

01:28.291 --> 01:31.958
<i>Follow me and ponder the question...</i>

01:35.375 --> 01:37.166
<i>"What if?"</i>

01:46.125 --> 01:49.375
There was an idea
to bring together a group of--

01:49.458 --> 01:50.500
ROMANOFF: Remarkable people?

01:50.583 --> 01:52.500
To see if they could
become something more?

01:52.583 --> 01:54.041
I know. I've heard the speech.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.583
Then you realize what's at stake.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.708
Which is why I'm surprised you'd wanna bet

01:57.791 --> 02:00.833
the future
of the Avengers Initiative on that.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.916
Stark may be eccentric,
but he's got potential.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.416
What he's got is a hangover.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.916
Did I ever tell you about this one time

02:11.000 --> 02:15.166
I actually recruited a Russian assassin
to join my American covert ops team?

02:15.250 --> 02:16.541
Vaguely rings a bell.

02:16.625 --> 02:19.333
Then you should know,
I'm not afraid of a big swing.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.583
Sir, I'm going
to have to ask you to exit the donut.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.375
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boyband.

02:27.458 --> 02:31.291
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

02:31.375 --> 02:33.916
-How's that working out for you?
-I've been worse.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.375
You've become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

02:37.458 --> 02:41.208
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the center of my universe.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.083
-STARK: I get it.
-Hit him.

02:43.166 --> 02:44.625
(SCREAMS) God. What'd she just do to me?

02:44.708 --> 02:46.833
What did we just do for you?

02:46.916 --> 02:49.625
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

02:49.708 --> 02:53.958
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms?

02:54.041 --> 02:55.416
Stark! You okay?

02:57.916 --> 02:59.833
-FURY: Stark!
-ROMANOFF: Tony. Tony!

03:04.750 --> 03:05.958
He's dead.

03:08.250 --> 03:12.416
WATCHER: <i>Humanity, so eager,</i>
<i>so willing to face the impossible,</i>

03:12.500 --> 03:14.833
<i>yet blind to the bigger picture.</i>

03:14.916 --> 03:19.250
<i>Inside one week, three strange</i>
<i>and separate stories unfolded.</i>

03:19.333 --> 03:23.541
<i>A genius battled</i>
<i>his demons both inside and out,</i>

03:24.583 --> 03:28.041
<i>while the world</i>
<i>met the monster hiding in the man.</i>

03:29.333 --> 03:32.041
<i>And a godly prince fell to Earth.</i>

03:33.166 --> 03:34.625
<i>I am the Watcher.</i>

03:34.708 --> 03:36.625
<i>And where humans see chaos,</i>

03:36.708 --> 03:39.041
<i>I see the crucible that would transform</i>

03:39.125 --> 03:43.000
<i>this collection of individuals</i>
<i>into a team of heroes.</i>

03:44.375 --> 03:47.333
<i>At least, that's how things</i>
<i>played out in one universe.</i>

03:48.125 --> 03:49.541
<i>But in this one...</i>

03:59.416 --> 04:01.208
Sir, we found it.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.500
Kind of in the middle
of something here, Coulson.

04:03.583 --> 04:06.958
COULSON: <i>Not sure it can wait, sir.</i>
<i>Locals are getting curious.</i>

04:07.041 --> 04:09.500
Set up a perimeter
and tell the team I'm en route.

04:10.666 --> 04:13.708
I may not have been a fan of Tony Stark,
but I didn't kill him.

04:13.791 --> 04:15.333
Save your spin for Pierce.

04:15.416 --> 04:17.916
He wants you in New York
first thing for questioning.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.625
Wanna give us a minute?

04:21.166 --> 04:22.333
This wasn't me.

04:22.416 --> 04:25.291
I know that,
but S.H.I.E.L.D. has protocols,

04:25.375 --> 04:27.791
so my hands, like yours, are tied.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.708
-You know these won't hold me.
-Oh, I'm counting on it.

04:30.791 --> 04:33.958
Someone inside S.H.I.E.L.D.
compromised Stark's antidote.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.083
I need someone on the outside
to find out who.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.333
Sure you wanna take
another big swing on me, boss?

04:39.416 --> 04:41.125
Safest bet I'll ever make.

04:58.166 --> 05:00.333
Wow. So serious.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.625
Maybe we should get some tunes going.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.708
Lighten the mood.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.625
You guys are no fun.
Here. Mind holding these for me?

05:12.708 --> 05:14.166
Of course. Uh... What?

05:18.041 --> 05:19.875
I never did get what he sees in her.

05:19.958 --> 05:23.291
Sure, she can land a punch,
but only 'cause people don't expect it.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.291
What? Stop! Stop the truck!

05:39.000 --> 05:40.291
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:43.416 --> 05:45.833
Oh! Come on!

05:54.916 --> 05:59.083
BARTON: Best we can tell, it's extremely
powerful and not from around here.

05:59.666 --> 06:03.125
Electromagnetic, neutron,
vita radiations, all off the charts.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.041
Well, that doesn't sound ominous at all.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.916
It's been happening all night.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.041
The artifact has a bit of an attitude.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.125
Also, no one can lift it.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.291
Not even Jackson and he does CrossFit.

06:19.375 --> 06:23.291
Something that powerful goes missing,
someone always comes looking.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.375
We just have to cross our fingers
that someone is an ally.

06:36.875 --> 06:38.041
So, what's the move?

06:38.125 --> 06:42.041
Same as always.
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.666
We got a man down. Sound the alarms.

06:48.958 --> 06:50.875
I think the worst just got here.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.708
FURY: Coulson, talk to me.

06:53.791 --> 06:56.750
We got a perimeter breach.
Multiple agents down and...

06:58.875 --> 07:00.166
Whoa.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.416
I got visual on the intruder.

07:03.458 --> 07:06.500
He's a Caucasian male,
mid-twenties with...

07:08.083 --> 07:09.750
really great hair.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.666
Excuse me?

07:11.750 --> 07:14.833
COULSON: <i>It's an accurate description.</i>
<i>Sir, he's gorgeous.</i>

07:14.916 --> 07:17.833
-I need eyes in the sky. Barton.
-BARTON: <i>Already on it.</i>

07:19.916 --> 07:21.625
He's making a move on the hammer.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.125
One shot, one kill, sir.
Just say the word.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.625
FURY: <i>Hold your fire. I wanna see this.</i>

07:32.541 --> 07:36.375
Whoa. Coulson wasn't lying
about the hair. That's nice.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.166
Fury, now or never.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.208
-(THOR GRUNTS)
-FURY: <i>Hold your--</i>

07:47.375 --> 07:50.041
<i>Damn it, Barton. I told you to stand down.</i>

07:50.125 --> 07:52.500
I did! Wasn't me! I didn't shoot!

07:53.916 --> 07:55.166
GUARD 2: Drop your weapon!

07:55.250 --> 07:56.958
I swear, I didn't shoot.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.375
Your arrow would indicate otherwise.

08:05.500 --> 08:10.375
This doesn't make any sense.
I don't slip. I don't misfire.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.500
-What's the word on our intruder?
-Dead.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.541
And if his blood samples
are to be believed,

08:15.625 --> 08:19.375
he's almost a thousand years old
and not of this world.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.666
First Stark, now Muscle Beach.

08:21.750 --> 08:25.833
That's two high value S.H.I.E.L.D. targets
killed by our own agents inside 24 hours.

08:25.916 --> 08:29.041
-Barton's sticking to his story?
-He's pretty bent out of shape.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.208
-Won't talk to anyone.
-He'll talk to me.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.916
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.250
Barton.

08:43.041 --> 08:45.541
Barton. Coulson, get a medic.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.083
How could this... Who did you let in here?

08:48.166 --> 08:49.333
-No one.
-COULSON: No one.

08:49.416 --> 08:52.083
Stay with me. Stay with me.

08:54.625 --> 08:57.750
We're running a tox screen
to see if it was a cyanide capsule.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.333
Barton had a wife and kids.

08:59.416 --> 09:01.708
If he was gonna go,
it wouldn't be willingly.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.958
You think he was murdered.

09:03.041 --> 09:07.166
If I had to guess, my money
is on the same someone who killed Stark.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.375
But Barton
was in a locked cell under observation.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.750
There was no sign of struggle,
no entry wounds.

09:11.833 --> 09:14.625
It's weird, but I also have a space corpse

09:14.708 --> 09:17.958
that looks like a Chippendales dancer
rotting on the next table over.

09:21.041 --> 09:22.666
Oh, wow.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.416
Even while rotting,
he smells like lavender.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.333
Really? (SNIFFING)

09:28.291 --> 09:29.291
Mmm.

09:29.375 --> 09:31.916
Still, there's not a lot
connecting a billionaire playboy

09:32.000 --> 09:35.041
and a S.H.I.E.L.D. assassin,
unless you have any ideas.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.125
There was an idea.

09:52.208 --> 09:54.958
Dr. Ross.
Not sure if you remember me, but--

09:55.041 --> 09:57.208
(SIGHS) Oh, I remember.

09:57.291 --> 09:59.125
And I'll tell you
the same thing I told you

09:59.208 --> 10:01.541
the last time
S.H.I.E.L.D. came poking around.

10:01.625 --> 10:02.833
I haven't seen him.

10:02.916 --> 10:05.666
I'm not here about the green guy.

10:05.750 --> 10:10.583
His name is Dr. Bruce Banner.
And I'm in a rush, Agent Romanoff.

10:10.666 --> 10:13.375
I'm here about Tony Stark.
I believe he was murdered.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
What? By whom?

10:16.583 --> 10:21.250
Me. Or at least someone's trying
to make it look that way, using this.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.625
So, why did you come to me?

10:25.708 --> 10:29.583
You're an expert in the tactical
applications of cellular biology.

10:29.666 --> 10:33.041
There are plenty of others.
Why did you really come here?

10:33.750 --> 10:35.916
I need to keep this
off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar

10:36.458 --> 10:39.583
and you seem to have
some experience in that department.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.000
Mmm. Well, your injector's clean

10:45.083 --> 10:48.791
and there's no traces
of lethal pathogens of any kind.

10:48.875 --> 10:49.875
Then what killed him?

10:49.958 --> 10:52.791
BETTY: Whatever it was,
it wasn't biological.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.500
Your antidote didn't even
make it out of the syringe.

10:55.583 --> 11:00.000
It looks to me like a tiny projectile
of some kind was fired from the needle.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.000
You're thinking nanotech?

11:02.083 --> 11:05.125
I'm a biologist, not a ballistics expert.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.916
And I believe we're done here.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.541
Huh. You got a side job, Dr. Ross?

11:14.625 --> 11:16.416
What? I don't know. I...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.083
A student must have left it there.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.791
FURY: <i>I got bad news and worse news.</i>

11:24.875 --> 11:27.458
<i>-You in a secure location?</i>
-Not currently.

11:28.708 --> 11:29.916
FURY: <i>Barton's dead.</i>

11:33.291 --> 11:34.958
FURY: <i>I know what he meant to you.</i>

11:41.833 --> 11:44.000
Who do I kill?

11:44.666 --> 11:47.291
FURY: Looks like his
and Stark's murders are connected.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.791
-ROMANOFF: <i>By what?</i>
-FURY: The Avengers Initiative.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.458
Seems our killer
is going after the candidates.

11:53.541 --> 11:55.375
ROMANOFF: <i>If someone wanted</i>
<i>to kneecap S.H.I.E.L.D.,</i>

11:55.458 --> 11:56.666
<i>that's a good place to start.</i>

11:57.333 --> 11:58.625
Who else is on the list?

11:58.708 --> 12:02.541
FURY: <i>That's the thing.</i>
<i>Bruce Banner and you.</i>

12:02.625 --> 12:06.500
ROMANOFF: Under different circumstances,
I'd be flattered. So would Clint.

12:06.583 --> 12:10.250
FURY: <i>You need to get yourself to ground.</i>
<i>But first, find Banner.</i>

12:10.333 --> 12:13.416
Funny thing, boss. Think I already have.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.833
I... I'm sorry,
but I can't let you in there.

12:17.916 --> 12:20.208
Move, or I'll make you move.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.750
No need for violence, Agent Romanoff.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.875
That's probably not gonna work out.
For anyone.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.500
What? What is it?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.083
We need to go. Now.

12:50.041 --> 12:51.541
FURY: <i>What's your 20, Coulson?</i>

12:51.625 --> 12:53.666
Coffee run. Needed a breather.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.458
Got you a double macchiato.
Just how you like it.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.125
What the...

13:06.541 --> 13:10.083
Director, sensors are reporting
a massive energy surge.

13:10.166 --> 13:13.583
-Seems like it came out of nowhere.
-What are you seeing, Coulson?

13:13.666 --> 13:16.416
A meteorological phenomenon of some kind.

13:19.875 --> 13:23.250
Oh, boy. Whatever it is,
it came with bogeys.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.916
-They look like they're from Earth?
-COULSON: <i>Maybe Middle-earth?</i>

13:33.750 --> 13:35.083
Go get 'em, boss.

13:46.083 --> 13:49.708
Looking for directions, sir?
Because you seem to have lost your way.

13:49.791 --> 13:54.041
(CHUCKLES) You would do best
to kneel before a god.

13:54.125 --> 13:58.833
We don't really do that here.
No matter who or what you are.

13:58.916 --> 14:03.041
-I am Loki, Crown Prince of Asgard.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:03.125 --> 14:04.541
The rightful king of Jotun--

14:06.375 --> 14:10.291
-(CLEARS THROAT) Jotunheim. And God of M--
-(CELL PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

14:11.458 --> 14:14.375
Mischief. Are you gonna take that?
I'm in the middle of something.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.750
Damn it, Fury! Pick up.

14:15.833 --> 14:19.416
Hey, I'm telling you, it's safer
for everyone if I fend for myself.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
-I sort of can't die.
-Then I guess you're in luck.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.041
Look alive, people.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.666
I want strike teams locked, loaded,
and ready to move in on my mark.

14:40.416 --> 14:41.958
I'm a little busy here, Widow.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.833
ROMANOFF: <i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>We'll start a support group.</i>

14:43.916 --> 14:47.333
I've got General Ross,
a dozen snipers and a few tanks.

14:47.416 --> 14:49.416
-What are you dealing with?
-FURY: <i>Space Vikings.</i>

14:49.500 --> 14:52.000
-Show-off.
-FURY: <i>Handle it, then get to ground.</i>

14:53.333 --> 14:54.375
Lady trouble?

14:54.458 --> 14:57.583
Well, what exactly is it
that brought you here, Mr. Loki?

14:57.666 --> 14:59.000
Vengeance.

14:59.083 --> 15:04.416
An agent of this planet murdered
Thor Odinson, the Crown Prince of Asgard.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.291
Natasha Romanoff, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

15:07.375 --> 15:11.000
I have Bruce Banner in my custody.
You need to stand down.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.875
-Hey, hey! Don't shoot!
-Who the hell opened fire?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.125
SOLDIER 3: <i>Not us, sir.</i>

15:17.208 --> 15:19.541
Bruce! It's okay. We're okay, right?

15:19.625 --> 15:21.708
I'll get you out of this.
I swear on my life.

15:21.791 --> 15:25.875
Director Fury, you fail to comprehend
the enormity of the situation.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.958
Oh, I'm comprehending, all right.

15:30.041 --> 15:34.708
Agent Romanoff, I think you might
be better off getting out of here.

15:34.791 --> 15:37.750
Which is why I have to ask,
what's in the box?

15:37.833 --> 15:39.125
Ooh.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.458
Such insolence will not be tolerated.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.958
And your planet
will be taken as retribution.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.666
-Take it down!
-(GUNS FIRING)

16:32.583 --> 16:34.708
Oh, you want some of this? Come on!

16:34.791 --> 16:38.041
Father! No! Stop! Stop, please!

16:39.041 --> 16:41.625
-(MAN SCREAMING)
-(SOBBING) Stop!

16:42.708 --> 16:46.041
-There's nothing you can do.
-That's my father. He'll listen to me.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.083
The General
isn't the one who started this.

16:49.708 --> 16:50.833
Then who did?

16:57.333 --> 16:58.500
Bruce!

17:00.833 --> 17:02.083
Bruce!

17:10.958 --> 17:13.708
(SOBBING) No. No, no, no. Bruce.

17:13.791 --> 17:18.125
But he can't die. He can't die.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.166
He can't.

17:26.833 --> 17:32.083
Declaring war on this planet
will not bring your prince back!

17:32.166 --> 17:33.291
SIF: Wait.

17:33.375 --> 17:37.166
He's not wrong.
The All-Father would want us to listen.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.083
We have the same enemy here.

17:42.166 --> 17:45.208
The person who killed your brother
also killed two of my people.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.291
Good people.
We should be working together.

17:48.375 --> 17:50.500
We are not allies.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.458
Then let me help you.

17:52.541 --> 17:55.083
I promise,
when I find your brother's killer,

17:55.166 --> 17:57.833
you will have your pound of flesh.

17:57.916 --> 18:00.166
What a fascinating choice of words.

18:01.166 --> 18:04.250
But I shall require the entire corpse.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.333
You need to give me time.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.500
Very well.

18:11.583 --> 18:16.750
You have until the next rise of Midgard's
sun to deliver my brother's assassin,

18:16.833 --> 18:21.000
or I will reduce
this planet to ash and ice.

18:33.291 --> 18:35.333
COULSON: (OVER PHONE)
<i>Why do you need my password?</i>

18:35.458 --> 18:38.250
ROMANOFF: (SIGHS) I need to get
into the Avengers Initiative files,

18:38.333 --> 18:42.041
but I'm locked out of the system
and wanted for murder.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.000
COULSON: <i>I'm not telling you</i>
<i>my password, Romanoff.</i>

18:44.083 --> 18:45.958
-ROMANOFF: Why not?
-COULSON: <i>Because I'm not.</i>

18:46.041 --> 18:48.875
ROMANOFF: Coulson.
Clint was your friend, too.

18:50.666 --> 18:56.291
(SIGHS) <i>Hashtag-Steve-Steve-Steve-</i>
<i>I-heart-Steve-0-7-0-4.</i>

18:56.375 --> 18:57.416
Wow.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.125
-Good one, Coulson.
<i>-What?</i>

18:59.208 --> 19:01.375
No, nothing. That's great. Thank you.

19:28.666 --> 19:31.375
Huh. How did a woman
who died two years ago

19:31.458 --> 19:33.125
access the database yesterday?

19:39.333 --> 19:44.541
You won't win. Not against me.
Not against S.H.I.E.L.D.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.208
FURY: <i>You found me. You know what to do.</i>

20:03.750 --> 20:06.333
Fury, it's Hope! It's all about Hope!

20:22.625 --> 20:25.125
ROMANOFF: (OVER PHONE)
<i>It's Hope! It's all about Hope!</i>

20:30.625 --> 20:32.875
<i>It's Hope! It's all about Hope!</i>

20:35.083 --> 20:37.666
<i>It's Hope! It's all about Hope!</i>

20:38.375 --> 20:39.916
COULSON: Four hours to sunup, sir.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.625
I haven't forgotten.

20:42.708 --> 20:46.250
Sir, I understand that this
Prince Loki situation is the very reason

20:46.333 --> 20:48.291
you proposed the Avengers Initiative

20:48.375 --> 20:51.583
for a group of remarkable individuals
to fight the battles we can't.

20:51.666 --> 20:52.750
I wrote the speech.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.583
There's still one name left, sir.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.208
Yours.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.416
I'm not the only Avenger left.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.125
What?

21:19.708 --> 21:22.083
COULSON: Is that a beeper from the '90s?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.583
Also our last hope.

21:25.875 --> 21:30.666
"Hope. It's all about Hope."

21:31.583 --> 21:33.416
(CHUCKLES) Widow.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.791
COULSON: Boss?

21:39.958 --> 21:42.541
-Where are you going?
-Not sure.

21:42.625 --> 21:46.250
Either make a pact
with a god or deal with a devil.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.833
You got a name, soldier?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.333
I'm here to see your boss.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.750
If it isn't Hank Pym.

22:37.833 --> 22:43.625
HANK: The balls you have to come here
and stand over her grave.

22:43.708 --> 22:44.958
Oh, don't worry about her.

22:45.041 --> 22:47.625
I doubt she'd mind,
considering she's dead.

22:47.708 --> 22:51.166
She died because S.H.I.E.L.D. killed her.

22:51.916 --> 22:53.375
She died because of you.

22:53.458 --> 22:58.958
Agent Hope Van Dyne was killed
on a mission outside Odessa, Ukraine.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.291
Agent?

23:00.375 --> 23:03.375
She was my daughter! My little girl.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.750
She missed her mother
and you exploited that!

23:06.833 --> 23:08.750
Her mother was an agent?

23:08.833 --> 23:11.583
Don't play the fool with me, Fury.

23:11.666 --> 23:17.500
You filled her head with nonsense about
protecting humanity and saving the world.

23:17.583 --> 23:21.625
You just left out how she died
the same way her mother did,

23:21.708 --> 23:23.666
doing S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dirty work!

23:23.750 --> 23:28.625
And that gave you
permission to murder them?

23:28.708 --> 23:33.000
Anthony Stark? Clint Barton?
Bruce Banner? Natasha Romanoff?

23:33.083 --> 23:36.083
You took everything from me.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.166
<i>I wanted you to hurt.</i>

23:42.875 --> 23:46.833
<i>To witness everything</i>
<i>you've ever worked for...</i>

23:48.833 --> 23:50.416
<i>fought for...</i>

23:53.208 --> 23:54.666
<i>hoped for...</i>

23:57.708 --> 23:59.083
<i>die.</i>

23:59.666 --> 24:02.166
And what of Thor, Prince of Asgard?

24:02.250 --> 24:05.833
Goldilocks? You would have
recruited him in a heartbeat.

24:05.916 --> 24:09.250
Sold him some malarkey about being a hero.

24:09.333 --> 24:12.708
That's what you do.
What S.H.I.E.L.D. has always done.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.625
Find others to fight your battles.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.416
That's it?
You murdered him because you could?

24:17.500 --> 24:21.125
His death was a favor.
Yours will be a triumph.

24:34.791 --> 24:36.250
What the...

24:36.333 --> 24:39.875
You're still pretty spry
for a guy with a corner office.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.750
You never cared about Hope.

24:50.833 --> 24:52.750
I don't give a damn about any of them.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.708
Fury! Come on.

25:03.791 --> 25:07.625
You're supposed to be a killer?
Well, come on, then. Kill me.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.833
-(GASPS)
-Ooh.

25:14.291 --> 25:16.375
HANK: How are you...

25:16.458 --> 25:19.041
-(FURY LAUGHING)
-Stop moving, Fury.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.125
What are you doing? Let's go--

25:21.208 --> 25:23.875
It's like you're everywhere. Aah!

25:51.208 --> 25:53.916
Uh, what's with the goth kid?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.416
Hello. Trickster God. Hi.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.791
S.H.I.E.L.D. is people,

25:58.875 --> 26:02.541
people willing to give their lives
for something greater than themselves

26:02.625 --> 26:06.458
to save the world from men like you.

26:09.500 --> 26:14.375
Agent Hope Van Dyne understood that
and she will never be forgotten.

26:14.958 --> 26:17.458
Then you honor her.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.250
Then honor her.

26:22.208 --> 26:25.375
Well, this was
an absolute pleasure, Director Fury.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.166
Good. Now take your hammer
and get off my planet.

26:28.250 --> 26:31.500
(CHUCKLES) About that,
we should be allies.

26:31.583 --> 26:33.500
You know, I've just had an idea.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.833
I was thinking I might extend
my stay here on Midgard.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.000
For how long?

26:52.125 --> 26:54.750
Good evening, my loyal subjects.

26:55.333 --> 26:58.750
It is with great pride
that I stand before you today

26:58.833 --> 27:01.416
to announce that in just one day's time,

27:01.500 --> 27:05.083
the nations of Earth
have put aside their differences

27:05.166 --> 27:08.416
and united under my command.

27:08.500 --> 27:12.416
<i>It's the unspoken truth of humanity</i>
<i>that you crave subjugation.</i>

27:12.500 --> 27:17.000
<i>The bright lure of freedom hobbles you,</i>
<i>diminishes your life's joy.</i>

27:17.083 --> 27:20.291
<i>You were made to be ruled.</i>

27:20.875 --> 27:27.125
So I have come
to help you fulfill your destiny.

27:33.416 --> 27:36.458
The Avengers fell
before they had a chance to rise.

27:36.541 --> 27:38.000
May they rest in peace.

27:38.083 --> 27:40.083
They can, but we won't.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.666
The Avengers were always
meant to be more than a team.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.291
They were an idea,

27:46.375 --> 27:52.333
the affirmation of humanity's need
to believe that in our darkest hour,

27:52.916 --> 27:55.583
we will find our heroes.

27:59.541 --> 28:03.666
<i>I believe that in this universe,</i>
<i>as in every other, hope never dies.</i>

28:05.833 --> 28:09.833
<i>As long as someone keeps</i>
<i>their good eye on the bigger picture.</i>

28:11.625 --> 28:12.833
Welcome back, Captain.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.541
So where's the fight?
