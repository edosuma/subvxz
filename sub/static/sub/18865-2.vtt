WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:05.170
- Ah!
David: Oh my God!

00:05.205 --> 00:07.005
Alexis: Ugh!

00:07.040 --> 00:08.306
- Jeez, I'm not out
the door yet!

00:08.341 --> 00:10.509
- Hey, hey, David,
isn't that your friend?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.911
Moira: Oh, I didn't
recognize him clothed.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.181
- Yeah, I don't know
what he's doing here.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.317
- You sure, David, 'cause
I've got a pretty good idea.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.720
- Alexis, don't be crass.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.522
David, is he here to s--

00:23.557 --> 00:25.090
- Oh my God,
I literally told him

00:25.125 --> 00:27.559
to never come back here
while you people were home.

00:27.594 --> 00:28.794
So, I don't...

00:30.464 --> 00:32.030
Um...

00:32.065 --> 00:33.465
What are you doing here?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.500
- Well, I was just
in the neighborhood. so...

00:35.535 --> 00:37.002
- I just thought
after last week,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.303
we decided to avoid the motel.

00:38.338 --> 00:39.971
Like, generally speaking.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.473
Moira: David, what should we do?

00:41.508 --> 00:43.108
- Should we be walking ahead,

00:43.143 --> 00:44.476
how far ahead should
we be walking?

00:44.511 --> 00:45.844
- Uh...
Alexis: I'm just gonna walk,

00:45.879 --> 00:47.479
'cause I don't even care
what's going on right now.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.981
- Keep walking, okay?!
Walk, walk, walk!

00:50.016 --> 00:51.983
Um... what's going on?

00:52.018 --> 00:53.452
(Door creaks open then slams)

00:57.057 --> 00:58.490
- Oh...

00:59.826 --> 01:02.527
- Okay, um, so you weren't here
for me today.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.029
Okay.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.465
- Well, it's just a casual hang,

01:06.500 --> 01:08.133
you know, we talked about it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.135
That's totally fine,
I'm just--

01:10.170 --> 01:10.936
I'm tasting metal,
for some reason.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.404
Um...

01:12.439 --> 01:14.106
Alexis: Oh God, David,
this is so awkward!

01:14.141 --> 01:16.541
Moira: What? What's happening?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.443
Johnny: Well, I don't think
Jake is here to see David.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.145
- We can hear you.
Very clearly.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.546
- Oh.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.115
Stevie: Okay, He's early.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.516
I didn't know--
- No! No, no.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.351
- Okay, sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.054
Uh...
(Door slams)

01:30.557 --> 01:32.224
- Have fun, you two.
- Oh John, no!

01:32.259 --> 01:33.658
- Oh, right.
- Don't worry, David,

01:33.693 --> 01:36.128
I've been in this situation
like, the most times,

01:36.163 --> 01:38.130
except I'm always the girl
getting into the truck.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.198
- The least they could do
is offer us a ride!

01:40.233 --> 01:42.234
- Okay, let's move please,
people!

01:42.269 --> 01:47.105
♪ ♪

01:48.742 --> 01:50.041
(Birds chirp)

01:52.279 --> 01:53.645
Twyla: All set, Mr. Rose?

01:53.680 --> 01:56.281
- Yes, Twyla, I think
I'll have the eggs,

01:56.316 --> 01:58.850
and brown toast, over easy,

01:58.885 --> 02:00.418
the eggs, not the toast.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.820
- Comin' right up.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.356
- And I think I might
ask for a--

02:04.391 --> 02:05.824
Oh my God!

02:07.260 --> 02:08.627
What happened?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.595
- Well, I went
whitewater rafting,

02:10.630 --> 02:13.331
- Oh no, well, that'll do it,
I mean...

02:13.366 --> 02:15.233
- Anyway, it's fine now.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.269
Yesterday it was
this stabbing pain,

02:17.304 --> 02:19.738
but today it's more like
a really intense throbbing.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.374
- Well, it's not urgent,
not urgent.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.442
I don't need coffee
with breakfast, so.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.777
- I'll grab it right after
I clear these.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.546
- Well, if it's not
too much trouble?

02:28.848 --> 02:30.248
Doris: Can I help you
with those?

02:30.283 --> 02:31.616
- Oh, no, no.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.118
- Oh, you know, I can help,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.686
I can help with that, Twyla.

02:34.721 --> 02:37.422
- No, no, they say it's better
to work through the pain.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.057
Really.
- Oh well, there you go.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.893
If those are the doctor's
orders...

02:44.698 --> 02:46.498
- No, I mean, I can help, Twyla.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.832
I do have a bad back,

02:47.867 --> 02:49.834
But I-I can certainly uh...

02:49.869 --> 02:51.570
help out here.
- Oh!

02:53.573 --> 02:55.507
David: Uh, who picked
through my cake,

02:55.542 --> 02:57.042
and only left the icing?

02:57.077 --> 02:58.543
- Who eats the icing?!

02:58.578 --> 03:00.645
- What kind of barnyard
were you raised in,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.414
where you just eat
someone else's food?!

03:02.449 --> 03:03.815
- So you can share a boyfriend,

03:03.850 --> 03:05.283
but you can't share
a piece of cake?

03:05.318 --> 03:06.618
- I'm not sharing a boyfriend,

03:06.653 --> 03:08.553
Stevie and I are both
dating Jake,

03:08.588 --> 03:10.121
at the same time,

03:10.156 --> 03:11.923
like sexually evolved
human beings.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.759
- Oh, okay, because in my
experience with throuples--

03:14.794 --> 03:16.728
- We're not a "throuple!"

03:18.031 --> 03:19.598
- When it comes to three
people, David,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.600
there's always a favorite.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.268
It's just like how Mom
likes you more.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.136
- That's not true,
and please don't include Mom

03:25.171 --> 03:27.439
in an analogy about
my relationship, thank you!

03:27.474 --> 03:29.541
Moira: David, lunch today?

03:29.576 --> 03:31.243
- No.
- Oh, okay.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.911
Well, I'll dine alone.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.646
- See?!

03:36.049 --> 03:37.282
- See what?

03:38.785 --> 03:41.853
- Alexis seems to think
you like me more.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.489
- Alexis, don't be ridiculous!

03:44.524 --> 03:46.024
It's exactly the kind
of paranoia

03:46.059 --> 03:48.827
that makes me wary of spending
time with you.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.829
- I was sitting right here,

03:50.864 --> 03:52.797
and you chose to eat
lunch alone.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.599
- That is simply not true!

03:54.634 --> 03:56.568
I didn't see you.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.236
At first.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.608
Alexis, I would be
absolutely glee-ridden

04:03.643 --> 04:05.877
if you would have lunch
with me.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.145
Today.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.315
- No, no, no, no, no.
I wasn't actually--

04:10.350 --> 04:14.786
- You'll meet me at the cafe
for their one o'clock sitting.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.290
- Something wrong?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.791
- No!

04:21.194 --> 04:22.427
(Birds chirp)

04:25.699 --> 04:27.599
- I should go.

04:27.634 --> 04:28.900
Don't wanna set a bad example

04:28.935 --> 04:31.503
for the rest of the motel staff.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.238
- I thought you were the only
one that worked there.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.974
- Yeah, that's another
good reason to go.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.475
- All right, well,
I'll drive you.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.077
- Mm, I think I'll walk.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.846
I'm trying very hard
not to repeat

04:41.881 --> 04:43.248
what happened last night.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.984
- Hmm, and here I am trying
very hard to repeat

04:46.019 --> 04:47.552
what happened last night.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.521
- (Laughs)

04:49.556 --> 04:51.489
I meant you picking me up.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.658
And David and his family.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.193
- Ohhh!

04:55.228 --> 04:56.995
Yeah, yeah.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.164
Could've timed that one better.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
- Yeah. Well, I guess
that's bound to happen

05:02.535 --> 05:05.970
sooner or later in this sort
of situation, right?

05:06.005 --> 05:08.006
- (Sighs)

05:08.041 --> 05:09.774
I'm sensing that
this whole setup

05:09.809 --> 05:11.876
is becoming a bit
of a problem for David.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.648
- Yeah, he's just very fragile.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.983
He's like a snowflake.
- Yeah.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.885
I just think maybe it's time
he and I have a chat.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.888
- Oh! No! That's not--

05:23.923 --> 05:25.223
I mean, that's not
what I was implying!

05:25.258 --> 05:26.958
- No, no, not at all.
This is a...

05:26.993 --> 05:28.493
This is a good idea.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.829
For him and for us.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.964
- Uhhh...

05:34.801 --> 05:36.167
- Here we go, Twyla.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.971
Table Five, a Caprese salad,
and a ginger ale.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.540
- Thank you, Mr. Rose,
I really appreciate this.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.709
- Oh!

05:44.744 --> 05:46.277
Yeah, it looks like
the morning rush

05:46.312 --> 05:48.113
is finally dying down.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.415
Maybe I can get the kitchen
to whip up

05:50.450 --> 05:53.118
a fresh batch of eggs
for us volunteers.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.655
Roland: Uh, Twyla, honey,
whenever you're ready.

05:57.690 --> 05:58.990
- I'll be right there!
- Okay.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.792
- Would you please pass me
my crutch?

06:00.827 --> 06:02.527
- Not a problem.
- Unless...

06:02.562 --> 06:03.962
- No, it's right here.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.331
- No, I was gonna say unless
you could possibly

06:06.366 --> 06:07.766
take their order?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.634
I just need to cash out
table three.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.603
- Sure, no, I can...

06:11.638 --> 06:13.171
I can do that.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.707
You know, it's funny,
I said eggs, but uh...

06:15.742 --> 06:17.542
I'm gonna be ready
for lunch soon.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.010
(Both laugh)

06:22.081 --> 06:23.782
Moira: No, I hear your concern,

06:23.817 --> 06:25.917
it's just apparently
what geese do.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.620
No, it's not the town's problem,

06:28.655 --> 06:31.322
you're just going to have
to watch where you step.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.924
I don't want to hear the-
I don't want--

06:32.959 --> 06:34.359
No, I don't wanna hear that!

06:34.394 --> 06:35.860
(Thuds)

06:35.895 --> 06:38.596
- Okay, I'm gonna take
an early lunch.

06:38.631 --> 06:41.699
Twyla's got a broken foot,
so lunch could take a while.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.002
You coming?
- Yes, let me just get--

06:45.271 --> 06:47.872
Oh wait, I don't think I can.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.875
- Okay, I didn't think it'd be
such a tough decision, so--

06:50.910 --> 06:53.344
- No, Ronnie!

06:53.379 --> 06:55.213
I would love nothing more than
to lunch with you today,

06:55.248 --> 06:58.650
but I believe I'm lunching
with Alexis.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.319
(Laughs) It's kind of a mother
daughter thing.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.254
- Oh, a little bonding time.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.157
- Yes, and what's so wrong
with that?!

07:06.192 --> 07:08.827
- I don't know, is there
something wrong with that?

07:08.862 --> 07:11.196
- Well, just because
my daughter and I

07:11.231 --> 07:12.964
don't do that sort of thing
doesn't mean it's impossible!

07:12.999 --> 07:14.933
- And I'm sure you'll have
a really good time.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.168
- Yes, we will! We will!

07:17.203 --> 07:20.305
Once I break the ice with a
provocative question or two.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.573
- Sure.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.274
- And then there's
the banter about the food,

07:23.309 --> 07:25.343
that always eats up
some time, doesn't it?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.078
- As long as you don't
over think it.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.847
- Oh, no. Ronnie!

07:28.882 --> 07:30.915
If you're still there
when we arrive,

07:30.950 --> 07:33.952
might we perhaps push
our tables together?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.120
- Yeah, perhaps.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.091
(Door opens and slams)

07:44.097 --> 07:45.530
(Car rumbles)

07:48.134 --> 07:49.801
- (Knocks) Hey!

07:49.836 --> 07:52.937
Um, you don't need me to work
through lunch today, do you?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.272
- Would that be to make up
for the work

07:54.307 --> 07:56.241
you were supposed to be doing
this morning?

07:56.276 --> 07:58.376
- I took one tiny break
to watch two episodes

07:58.411 --> 08:00.111
of "Scandal" with Mrs. McCreary,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.146
while she waited for her dog!

08:02.181 --> 08:04.048
- Why do you wanna work
through lunch?

08:04.083 --> 08:07.218
- Um no, I just thought
you might need me,

08:07.253 --> 08:10.221
and um, I wanted to see
if I needed to cancel

08:10.256 --> 08:12.657
this lunch that I have
at the cafe with my mom.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.792
- No need, have lunch
with your mom.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.294
- Okay, cool.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.897
Um, I totally don't mind though,

08:18.932 --> 08:20.932
if you want me to stay.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.800
- Is everything okay
with your mom?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.036
- Absolutely! Why?

08:25.071 --> 08:26.371
- Well, it's just
you've offered to work

08:26.406 --> 08:28.406
through lunch three times now,

08:28.441 --> 08:30.875
and most days I can barely get
you to come back after lunch.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.410
- Thank you, Ted.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.979
No, everything's fine,
it's just... (Sighs)

08:35.014 --> 08:38.216
we don't spend a lot of time
together just the two of us,

08:38.251 --> 08:41.019
which is why it's totally easy
to just raincheck.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.087
- Isn't that all the more
reason to go?

08:43.122 --> 08:44.289
I mean, I try to have
lunch with my mom

08:44.324 --> 08:46.157
at least once a week.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.159
And sometimes lunch
will turn into dinner,

08:48.194 --> 08:50.361
because we get carried away
chatting, and--

08:50.396 --> 08:52.096
- For sure, for sure.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.299
Okay, well I guess
lunch is free, then.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.501
So I guess I will
see you tomorrow.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.970
- Oh, well, there's still
work to be done,

08:59.005 --> 09:00.939
so probably best if you...

09:00.974 --> 09:02.540
come back after lunch.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.510
- Okay, but nothing
during lunch, though.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.911
Maybe?

09:06.946 --> 09:08.246
- Tell your mom I say hi.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.515
- Okay... thanks.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.486
- Well, I guess I was
a bit premature

09:15.521 --> 09:17.322
thinking the morning rush
was over.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.823
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.291
Table five, seven and eight,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.026
and the big group at twelve,

09:22.061 --> 09:23.328
separate cheques, if you can.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.029
- Thank you, Mr. Rose.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.332
And I've got a steak sandwich
here with your name on it.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.133
- Oh, you shouldn't have!

09:29.168 --> 09:30.468
- Just one thing
before you start--

09:30.503 --> 09:32.370
- Yeah, steak sauce, I know,
you read my mind.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.738
- Actually, I was gonna ask
if you could take this

09:33.773 --> 09:35.106
to table four.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.275
- Oh! Yes, yes, I can.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.977
And then I'll be back
for that sandwich,

09:39.012 --> 09:40.511
avec sauce.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.113
- (Laughs)

09:42.148 --> 09:43.548
- Here you go.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.283
- I didn't order this,
I ordered the fish.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.884
- That's mine, the full combo?

09:46.919 --> 09:49.253
Female Customer: I wanted
to order the fish.

09:49.288 --> 09:50.655
- Well, you can order the fish.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.290
- He told me not to,
he said it was off.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.725
- The fish is off?!

09:53.760 --> 09:55.526
- No, no, the fish is fine,
it's just uh, you know,

09:55.561 --> 09:57.362
it was a bit fishy.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.030
Female Customer: You know what,
I'll just order

09:59.065 --> 10:00.531
the full combo instead.

10:00.566 --> 10:03.267
- Okay, but just to be clear,

10:03.302 --> 10:05.570
the combo is a cup of soup,

10:05.605 --> 10:08.172
and a half a sandwich.
- Then what is that?

10:08.207 --> 10:09.574
- It's the full combo.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.643
- There is no full combo.
- He said there was.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.511
- Well, not-not in those words.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.480
No, I said we'll see
what we can do.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.515
- Well, what's this, then?

10:17.550 --> 10:19.550
- That's just a soup
and a sandwich.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.853
- But there is a deal, right?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.154
- No.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.724
- You said it was a combo.
- No, no,

10:26.759 --> 10:29.560
I said it was like
an evolution of a combo.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.696
- But there's no deal?!

10:31.731 --> 10:33.598
- Well, there is a deal
on the combo,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.200
which is a cup of soup,

10:36.235 --> 10:37.769
and a half a sandwich.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.637
- So what's this gonna cost me?

10:39.672 --> 10:41.606
- Well, I-I think we can uh,

10:41.641 --> 10:43.641
charge you for two uh,
half combos.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.410
- There is no half combo!

10:45.445 --> 10:47.779
It's just a cup of soup,
and a half a sandwich!

10:47.814 --> 10:50.581
- Johnny, if I get
the soup with the brisket,

10:50.616 --> 10:52.884
is that then the full combo?

10:52.919 --> 10:54.585
- Mr. Rose?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.854
- Yeah, I'll fix it, uh, Twyla.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.123
All right, just soup,
and a sandwich.

11:00.893 --> 11:03.494
(Birds chirp, traffic rumbles)

11:09.402 --> 11:10.935
- (Sighs)

11:10.970 --> 11:12.570
(Clears throat)

11:15.875 --> 11:17.642
(Bell jingles)

11:20.279 --> 11:21.813
- Hey!
- Hello!

11:23.349 --> 11:24.849
- Hey.
(Air kiss sounds)

11:24.884 --> 11:26.818
(Laughs) Hey.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.587
- I'm so glad we're doing this.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.322
- Me too!

11:31.357 --> 11:32.690
- When your father comes over,

11:32.725 --> 11:34.726
just act like
everything's normal.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.428
- Is there something not normal
about us being here?

11:37.463 --> 11:39.564
- It's not normal for your
father to be waiting tables

11:39.599 --> 11:41.466
at a rural sandwich counter.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.334
- Eww! What's happening?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.635
- He thinks he's working.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.037
Just play along.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.605
- Well, can I get
you ladies started

11:47.640 --> 11:50.208
with anything that is not
a combo?

11:50.243 --> 11:53.344
- Um, I will have a mixed
green salad,

11:53.379 --> 11:54.812
and some chicken.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.781
- Me too, something in common
already.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.850
- Salads, good. Simple.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.886
- And I will get the dressing
on the side, please.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.454
- You'll get your dressing
on the salad,

12:03.489 --> 12:04.889
like everyone else.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.862
- Hmm!

12:13.332 --> 12:15.333
Hmm.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.702
- (Breathes heavily)

12:21.641 --> 12:23.074
(Exhaling)

12:24.544 --> 12:26.244
- So... huh, this is new.

12:28.815 --> 12:29.814
- Well, a lot more people
are seeing my body these days,

12:29.849 --> 12:31.449
so I just thought I would...

12:31.484 --> 12:32.850
What's going on?

12:32.885 --> 12:35.620
- I just wanted to check in,
you know,

12:35.655 --> 12:37.722
after that whole thing
last night.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.090
- Was it a whole thing?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.159
I mean, I went to dinner
with my family,

12:41.194 --> 12:42.894
and you had a...

12:42.929 --> 12:46.531
romantic rendezvous with
someone that we're both seeing.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.399
So...
- Yeah.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.767
That.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.502
- Well, I'm fine with it.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.437
- Me too.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.773
I just wanna make sure
that we're still fine,

12:55.808 --> 12:57.942
you know, down the line.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.678
Because what if things
get complicated?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.547
- What would make things
complicated?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.015
- Nothing!

13:04.050 --> 13:05.850
But the last thing we want
is a situation

13:05.885 --> 13:08.553
where one person is breaking up
with another person,

13:08.588 --> 13:09.987
and that person is hurt,

13:10.022 --> 13:11.889
because things have gotten
complicated!

13:11.924 --> 13:13.558
- Okay, I'm starting to feel
like I'm trapped

13:13.593 --> 13:14.992
in an Avril Lavigne lyric here.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.328
And while I not-so-secretly
love Avril,

13:17.363 --> 13:19.397
and have paid very close
attention to her battle

13:19.432 --> 13:20.765
with Lyme disease,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.200
um, I don't know why we're--

13:22.235 --> 13:23.801
- Okay.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.537
If you knew somebody
was planning

13:26.572 --> 13:28.105
on breaking up with you,

13:28.140 --> 13:30.808
wouldn't you wanna be the one
to break up with them first?

13:33.479 --> 13:35.880
- Okay, if you think he's going
to break up with you

13:35.915 --> 13:37.849
and you wanna be the first
one to do it,

13:37.884 --> 13:39.884
I say, be the first one
to do it.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.485
- Okay, I'm doing this wrong.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.154
I need to be more direct.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.690
- Yes, by just telling him
how you feel.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.024
I think it'll benefit everyone.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.526
- I meant you!
- Me?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.029
- I'm trying to warn you--

13:52.064 --> 13:53.564
- That you are going to be
ending things with him.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.100
And I appreciate that,
but message has been delivered.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.035
- Oh my God.
- Loud and clear.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.037
- Uh...
(Cell phone rings)

14:00.072 --> 14:01.305
- Oh.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.209
Okay, it's Jake, so um...

14:05.244 --> 14:06.711
- Oh, okay.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.480
Don't worry, I'm gonna let
you tell him.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.350
- Okay.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.951
- Hello?

14:13.986 --> 14:16.153
Yeah, no, I was just um...

14:16.188 --> 14:17.822
I was just doing squats,
actually.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.290
- Ugh!

14:21.227 --> 14:22.994
(Dishes clink)

14:25.865 --> 14:27.798
- Mmm!

14:27.833 --> 14:30.167
Um, I love having salad
for lunch.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.603
It's just, it's not heavy.

14:32.638 --> 14:35.306
- No, well, a heavy salad
might as well be a casserole.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.042
- Mhmm... (Laughs)

14:40.379 --> 14:41.612
- So, how are...

14:43.649 --> 14:46.150
working at the animal hos-

14:46.185 --> 14:49.287
Uh, how is working
at the animal hospital?

14:49.322 --> 14:50.888
- Fine.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.157
- That's marvelous.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.993
And...

14:57.296 --> 14:58.963
uh, your daily exercise
routine--

14:58.998 --> 15:00.364
- What are you looking at?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.767
- It's-well, it's a napkin.
- Let me see this.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.702
You had to prepare questions?!

15:04.737 --> 15:07.104
- I wouldn't categorize them
as questions exactly.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.773
- "What's your favorite color?"

15:08.808 --> 15:10.741
- Black.
- That's one of the questions!

15:10.776 --> 15:12.143
It's right after,

15:12.178 --> 15:14.045
"how is your job
at the animal hospital?"

15:14.080 --> 15:15.780
- Is it a crime, Alexis,

15:15.815 --> 15:18.282
that I had so many queries
for you that I wrote them down

15:18.317 --> 15:20.584
in anticipation
of forgetting them?

15:20.619 --> 15:22.320
- Well, you wouldn't need these
if you were having lunch

15:22.355 --> 15:24.956
with David.
- Oh, Alexis, please.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.058
I wasn't even sure
you'd show up.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.760
- (Scoffs) Why wouldn't
I show up?

15:29.795 --> 15:32.697
- You've never wanted to spend
time alone with me.

15:32.732 --> 15:35.066
There, I said it.

15:36.502 --> 15:37.935
- You never asked.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.204
- Bordeaux?! The trip I planned
for the two of us?

15:40.239 --> 15:42.206
- That was a wine tasting tour,

15:42.241 --> 15:44.008
and I was seven years old!

15:44.043 --> 15:45.343
- You could've used
the spittoon,

15:45.378 --> 15:46.877
That's what the other
children did.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.280
But you weren't interested.

15:49.315 --> 15:52.049
It was as if you didn't want
to be seen with me.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.919
- Well, did you ever wonder why?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.454
- To revel in my misery?

15:56.489 --> 15:59.256
- No, it's because you were
always being recognized.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.058
- Yes--
- No! Not now.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.460
Like, before.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.263
- Didn't you enjoy the warm glow

16:06.298 --> 16:08.099
that Mummy's spotlight
cast upon you?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.533
- No!
- Alexis!

16:11.070 --> 16:12.336
If I'd known you didn't like
the attention,

16:12.371 --> 16:14.171
I would've chosen to be
alone with you,

16:14.206 --> 16:17.742
and not out in public,
among the throngs of fans.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.443
- I don't remember throngs.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.248
I never meant for you
to think that I...

16:24.283 --> 16:27.351
didn't wanna spend
any time with you.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.420
- Well...

16:29.455 --> 16:33.524
I hope it's not too late
to make up for lost time.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.361
- (Sighs)

16:37.396 --> 16:38.662
Okay.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.633

I take it we'll be dining
together as a group tonight?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.968
Or will you be taking turns?

17:51.003 --> 17:53.270
- Um, first of all,
what are you doing here?!

17:53.305 --> 17:55.639
And second, we're gonna need
a minute.

17:55.674 --> 17:58.375
- So...
- Yeah, sure, take your time.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.613
- Okay.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.549
- David, may I?

18:05.584 --> 18:07.818
- Yeah.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.386
I know this hasn't been
easy on you lately,

18:09.421 --> 18:11.589
and that doesn't make me
feel good.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.091
And I know Stevie's been
feeling it a little bit, too.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.026
- Has she?

18:16.061 --> 18:18.295
- That's why I think there's
only one thing for me to do.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.864
- Oh, I should go.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.632
- No. No.
- Okay...

18:24.470 --> 18:27.104
- I think we all need to be
in this together.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.439
Now, you've been
with each other,

18:28.474 --> 18:30.241
and you've both been with me.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.510
Let's all be...

18:33.879 --> 18:35.379
with us.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.682
- Let's all be with us?

18:40.085 --> 18:41.986
- All of us.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.188
Together.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.157
- Mm, 'kay.
- Yeah...

18:46.192 --> 18:48.359
I don't think that's gonna work.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.361
- Stevie, we talked about this.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.530
- You talked about this?!

18:52.565 --> 18:54.665
- You said you didn't want
to make things complicated!

18:54.700 --> 18:57.334
- Yeah, that's why I invited
you both here.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.069
- (Sighs)

19:00.472 --> 19:02.173
- Wow, okay.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.108
- Hmm, I think maybe I...

19:04.143 --> 19:06.577
misread the situation here.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.045
- Yeah, I think that's a pretty
accurate realization. - Uh huh!

19:08.080 --> 19:09.547
- Might've done.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.248
- Okay.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.050
Okay, maybe it's best
we all just...

19:13.085 --> 19:15.286
take a step back from this.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.720
- Okay.
- Yeah, maybe that's...

19:16.755 --> 19:19.323
that's the best thing to do.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.158
- Mhmm.
- Well...

19:23.229 --> 19:25.429
This one's for you, muah!

19:25.464 --> 19:27.264
And you.
- Oh! I get one.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.966
- Mhmm, muah!
- Okay.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.302
- All right, I'll see 'ya.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.803
Ah!

19:35.140 --> 19:36.607
(Door slams)

19:40.179 --> 19:42.379
- To be clear,

19:42.414 --> 19:44.281
you were going to go
on a date with him,

19:44.316 --> 19:46.717
knowing that he had
just broken up with me?

19:48.153 --> 19:49.653
- No I wasn't.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.489
- Uh, you showed up
for the date.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.592
- No I didn't.

19:55.894 --> 19:59.263
- You're literally here
in the restaurant!

19:59.298 --> 20:00.598
- Because I was gonna tell him

20:00.633 --> 20:02.499
that I was breaking up with him.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.168
- Ohhh, okay.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.474
- Uh, yeah, fine.

20:10.509 --> 20:11.875
(Sighs)

20:11.910 --> 20:13.377
But if it makes you feel
any better,

20:13.412 --> 20:15.012
nobody hates me more than me.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.747
Generally speaking.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.949
- Fair enough, I would've done
the same thing.

20:20.419 --> 20:21.752
- Here you go, Mr. Rose.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.454
This is your share of the tips.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.489
- Oh Twyla, I can't take
any money.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.558
- I insist, you earned it.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.827
- Well, I have to admit,

20:29.862 --> 20:31.895
I haven't worked this hard
in a long time.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.299
- I'm glad to hear it.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.001
(Clinking)

20:37.036 --> 20:39.436
- Although the things
some of these customers

20:39.471 --> 20:40.771
can put you through!

20:40.806 --> 20:42.640
- (Laughs) Oh, I know.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.976
- Joking when you're way
too busy,

20:46.011 --> 20:48.479
trying to tell you how they
want their food cooked.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.415
- I've experienced a bit
of that myself.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.791
- Yeah, you know,
I think maybe um...

21:00.826 --> 21:02.626
you should keep my share
of the tips.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.895
- That's not necessary,
Mr. Rose.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.065
- No, just think of it
as a little reparation pay.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.567
- Well, that doesn't even
begin to cover it!

21:10.602 --> 21:12.369
(Both laugh)
