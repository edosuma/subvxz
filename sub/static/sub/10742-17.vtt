             safely tucked away.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.163
                     Jeannie?

16:06.198 --> 16:08.565
      Hello, old master.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.667
Hello, old Jeannie.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.168
         How art thou?

16:11.203 --> 16:12.269
             Fine.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.438
          Bit lonely.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.741
      How's Captain Healey
         treating you?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.942
          Oh, he's...

16:18.978 --> 16:21.846
  I have never worked so hard
       in my whole life.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.714
    You should see the villa
      she cooked up for me

16:23.749 --> 16:24.848
     in the French Riviera.

16:24.883 --> 16:26.450
       Twenty-five rooms.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.951
  Beautiful, beautiful, beau--

16:27.987 --> 16:29.219
 You're invited to be my guest.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.989
    Thanks a million, Roge.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.457
          Hey, you can come over
               in my yacht.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.691
   It's bigger than Onassis'.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.359
How are you gonna explain this?

16:35.395 --> 16:36.793
     As long as I do my work,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.463
    Dr. Bellows isn't going
 to mind my living comfortably.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.132
        I mean, Tony...

16:41.167 --> 16:43.334
     nothing is going to stand
       in the way of my job.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.436
     I wouldn't give that up
    for anything in the world.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.738
       You wouldn't, huh?

16:48.941 --> 16:51.308
    I've worked all my life
    to become an astronaut.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.110
    It, uh-- Well, you know
      how I feel about it.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.745
   It means everything to me.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.782
 Well, that's the nicest thing
      I ever heard, Roge.

16:57.817 --> 17:01.619
Say, you know, I think
this life suits you.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.254
    I've never seen you
        look better.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.954
         Ahem. Really?

17:04.991 --> 17:07.790
Oh, boy, you
and this house

17:07.827 --> 17:10.261
and this pool
and the servants.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.929
I'd like to have
a picture of it, Roge,

17:11.964 --> 17:13.464
to remind me
of the real you.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.031
               Well, that's, uh,
                  no problem.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.367
                       Jeannie?

17:19.172 --> 17:20.838
              Hey, thanks, Roge.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.207
                Gee, uh,
        I-I-I'm touched, really.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.309
             I'm so glad there
           are no hard feelings.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.011
Why should there
be any hard feelings?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.512
You let me keep
the coffee table.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.546
            [LAUGHS]

17:29.582 --> 17:30.848
   That was funny, wasn't it?

17:31.918 --> 17:33.750
[LAUGHS]
Yeah.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.152
          Yeah, funny.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.087
       Well, I better be
   getting back to the base.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.623
        Must you leave?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.057
    I'm afraid so, Jeannie.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.992
        I have a feeling
    I'll be seeing you soon.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.095
   Oh, I hope so, old master.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.200
Oh. Captain Nelson
is such a wonderful man.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.337
             Yeah, he's not only
               a wonderful man,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.172
      but he's a wonderful man
           with something

17:55.207 --> 17:56.574
          crooked up his sleeve.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.809
         I wonder what he wanted
            that picture for.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.977
                 [KNOCK ON DOOR]

18:00.012 --> 18:01.746
            Come in.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.614
                   Reporting
                 for duty, sir.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.315
      Oh, you and Captain Healey
                are due

18:05.351 --> 18:07.284
        for the pressure chamber
           experiment at 2:30.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.353
   Yes, sir.
         Where's Captain Healey?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.221
Oh, he's gonna
be a little late.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.824
It takes quite a time to finish
a 15-course luncheon.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.462
        Captain Healey is having
          a 15-course luncheon?

18:18.498 --> 18:21.832
Yes. Well, lying around
your pool all day,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.367
you work up
quite an appetite.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.470
Incidentally, it's
doing him a world of good.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.506
    [CHUCKLES]

18:28.541 --> 18:29.973
Looks marvelous,
doesn't he?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.377
           Where was this taken?

18:33.412 --> 18:35.913
Hm? Oh, at Captain
Healey's house.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.949
It's a quaint
little place, isn't it?

18:39.886 --> 18:43.087
             Captain Healey
        is assigned to the, uh--

18:43.122 --> 18:45.389
Project Gamma.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.758
Yeah, it's very hush-hush.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.094
I suppose there's
plenty of countries

18:50.129 --> 18:53.263
that pay a fortune for
information on Operation Gamma.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.368
          Captain Nelson...?

18:59.505 --> 19:03.140
               Did you ever find
                Captain Healey's

19:03.175 --> 19:05.810
          black Rolls Royce
    with the beautiful chauffeur

19:05.845 --> 19:07.111
               and the beautiful
                    footman?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.946
      Oh, yes, yes.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.615
It was on its way to take
Captain Healey to his yacht.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.950
                 His yacht?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.285
      Mm-hm.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.688
Roger claims that his yacht
is larger than Onassis'.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.624
You know how he's
always kidding around.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.594
             Uh...may I, um...

19:23.629 --> 19:25.229
             May I keep this?

19:25.264 --> 19:26.430
   Oh, certainly, sir.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.933
Roger's probably
back at his office now.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.535
  I'll go pick him up.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.287
 Give me General Peterson.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.825
                Hi, Roge.
             How was lunch?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.761
Paradise.
Just paradise.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.030
You should have stayed.
Had roast pheasant,

19:59.065 --> 20:01.131
a whole leg of lamb,
plover eggs.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.067
I haven't eaten that much
since breakfast.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.601
I wouldn't be
so worried, general,

20:04.637 --> 20:06.937
if Captain Healey wasn't
working on Operation Gamma.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.806
But when he starts
throwing money around--

20:08.841 --> 20:11.375
   You psychiatrists are always
  looking into the dark corners.

20:11.410 --> 20:12.776
                 You'll find
             that Captain Healey

20:12.812 --> 20:14.578
             has a perfectly
         reasonable explanation.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.380
            An uncle died
    and left him a lot of money.

20:16.415 --> 20:17.881
I certainly hope not, sir.
                      What?

20:17.916 --> 20:19.316
Well, according
to our records,

20:19.352 --> 20:20.984
Captain Healey
doesn't have an uncle.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.253
                 ROGER:
       I'm having a little party
           tonight, you know,

20:23.288 --> 20:24.355
          just a hundred people.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.922
             I thought you could
                  be there.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.524
             A 20-course dinner.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.828
       On second thought, let's
     make it a 30-course dinner.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.129
Well, you've sure
been a sport

20:32.164 --> 20:33.363
about this whole thing.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.865
Is there anything
I can do for you?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.967
How would you like a palace
in the Mediterranean?

20:37.003 --> 20:39.169
           A fleet of airplanes?
                  A harem?

20:39.205 --> 20:41.439
                  Your own army?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.639
Nothing's too good
for you.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.508
Anything. You name it.
What would you like?

20:44.543 --> 20:47.010
                 TONY:
          You're never gonna
      get away with this, Roger.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.379
                I never would
              have believed it.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.880
What are you gonna do?

20:49.915 --> 20:52.082
      I'm putting Captain Healey
            under arrest...

20:52.117 --> 20:53.851
               for high treason.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.820
      TONY:
General Peterson.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.921
General.
Colonel.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.623
Oh, I didn't realize
it was so late, sir.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.725
We better be getting over
to the pressure chamb--

21:00.760 --> 21:03.127
     I wouldn't let you anywhere
     near that pressure chamber!

21:03.162 --> 21:04.828
I'm sorry, sir.
What did you say?

21:04.864 --> 21:06.597
               Is that a picture
                 of your home?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.834
There's nothing wrong with
a little gracious living.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.803
  Where did you get the money
      to buy that house?!

21:12.838 --> 21:16.306
Where did I get the money
to buy the house?

21:16.341 --> 21:19.342
            DR. BELLOWS:
      And the black Rolls Royce
    with the beautiful chauffeur

21:19.378 --> 21:20.611
      and the beautiful footman?

21:20.646 --> 21:22.145
                  And the maids
                  at the house.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.714
                   And the maids
                   at the house.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.916
Well, I don't know
where to begin.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.551
          A confession right now
               will save you

21:27.586 --> 21:28.719
                    a lot of
               time and trouble.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.021
             Did a foreign power
                   pay you

21:31.056 --> 21:33.390
               for information
             on Operation Gamma?

21:33.425 --> 21:35.592
Foreign power?

21:35.628 --> 21:36.727
  Do you think I took money--

21:36.763 --> 21:38.595
           [CHUCKLES]
    Have you made a mistake.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.397
      Boy, I'd like to see
    the looks on your faces

21:40.432 --> 21:41.598
  when you find out the truth.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.033
                        What is
                      the truth?

21:43.068 --> 21:44.535
   Well, the truth, s-sir...

21:46.104 --> 21:48.338
      ...is I-I-I'd l-like
       to see my lawyer.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.440
  You're to consider yourself
      under office arrest!

21:50.476 --> 21:52.676
        I don't want you
   to go outside of this room

21:52.712 --> 21:54.311
         till the MPs arrive!

21:54.346 --> 21:55.913
                    I'm sorry,
                 Captain Healey.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.851
            Tony...they're gonna
                  shoot me.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.653
       Yeah.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.394
    Why didn't you tell them
        the truth, Roge?

22:11.430 --> 22:12.896
For the same reason
    you didn't.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.898
          We'd both be washed
       out of the space program.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.400
   Boy, Dr. Bellows isn't about
  to okay a couple of astronauts

22:17.436 --> 22:19.202
              who has genies
              hanging around.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.537
             Well, you've got to
                   help me.

22:20.572 --> 22:21.939
I don't know
what I can do.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.173
It's your problem.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.242
           But you're my buddy.
          Share and share alike.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.746
You're offering me
half a firing squad?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.814
         Oh, what a spot I'm in.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.083
        If I don't tell them
    where I got the money, bang.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.652
             I have firing squad
                 all the way.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.186
             And if I tell them,
               I'm washed out.

22:36.221 --> 22:37.320
           You've gotta help me.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.856
Well, I-I don't know
what I can do.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.423
I've got a heavy schedule.
        I gotta--

22:40.459 --> 22:41.625
Wait, wait, wait.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.193
Look, if you help me
this one time,

22:43.228 --> 22:44.895
I'll get you anything.
Anything.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.097
                        Jeannie?
     Jeannie?

22:46.132 --> 22:48.365
You want her after
all the trouble she's caused?

22:48.401 --> 22:49.933
           After all the trouble
               she's caused?

22:49.968 --> 22:51.502
               You're the one
            that caused trouble.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.103
           I-I've been trying to
               tell you that.

22:53.138 --> 22:54.170
      Of course I want her back.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.906
And you'll get me
off the hook?

22:55.941 --> 22:57.841
            Yeah, I can get you
              off the hook.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.075
   Oh, it's a deal.

        [SNAPS]

23:00.847 --> 23:02.880
          Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
                 oh, boy.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.082
 I don't know how to thank you,
         buddy, buddy.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.516
                Always glad
          to do a buddy a favor.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.485
Well, I'm officially
turning her over to you.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.487
              And I'm officially
                  accepting.

23:10.522 --> 23:12.156
             All right, Jeannie.
                 Come on out.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.931
          Oh, master.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.800
Hello, old master.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.936
       Ssh! Not so loud.
      You're all his now.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.772
       Oh, I know.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.408
          Well, I filled
       my end of the bargain,

23:31.443 --> 23:32.609
        now you fulfill yours.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.878
                      Hm?
                  Oh, Jeannie.

23:37.382 --> 23:39.249
                        Thanks.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.285
 Well...?

23:42.321 --> 23:43.754
                      That's it.

23:43.789 --> 23:44.822
That's it?

23:44.857 --> 23:46.223
That's it?
That's what?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.992
You said she was gonna
get me out of trouble.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.627
                        General
                       Peterson.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.196
     Well, are you
    gentlemen ready?

23:52.231 --> 23:53.697
               Uh, yes, sir.
          We're just on our way.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.098
         Well, the experiment's
                at 2:30.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.099
             You better hurry.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.201
                      We'll be
                   on time, sir.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.235
       Carry on.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.307
        Carry on?

24:03.342 --> 24:04.641
     What happened?
     They didn't--

24:04.676 --> 24:06.844
They didn't mention anything
    about arresting me.

24:08.013 --> 24:09.012
                      Oh, Roger,
                      I'm sorry.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.180
                     I forgot to
                      tell you.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.649
             Uh, among Jeannie's
            many accomplishments

24:12.684 --> 24:15.919
     is the fact that she's able
           to change time.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.922
They won't have any recollection
 of what went on in this office

24:18.958 --> 24:20.090
    a couple of minutes ago.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.125
               That's wonderful.
                 Wait a minute.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.694
  I could've done that myself.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.261
 I mean, I didn't need you to--

24:26.365 --> 24:27.831
Oh, oh. Uh, uh...

24:27.866 --> 24:30.567
 What's gonna happen when they
see my house and my cars again?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.170
               You won't have
            to worry about that.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.539
           At the same time
     she wiped out their memory,

24:35.575 --> 24:37.608
              she also wiped out
                  your house

24:37.643 --> 24:38.609
                 and your villa,

24:38.644 --> 24:40.377
                   and your car
                 and your yacht.

24:40.413 --> 24:42.278
                  And your suit.
