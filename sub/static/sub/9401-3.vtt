00:01.067 --> 00:01.667
Millie was right.

00:02.667 --> 00:04.201
Alex Dupre is the perfect choice

00:04.267 --> 00:06.167
to be the face of the new campaign.

00:06.234 --> 00:08.500
Alex, Millicent Huxtable, Clothes Over Bros.

00:08.567 --> 00:09.734
Welcome to Tree Hill.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.034
Thank you.

00:11.101 --> 00:14.101
I want you to move your stuff in, okay?

00:14.167 --> 00:16.101
This is our house now, not just mine.

00:16.167 --> 00:19.267
Quinn, what actually happened
between you and David?

00:19.334 --> 00:22.101
He used to see the world
exactly the way I saw it.

00:22.167 --> 00:24.067
He just doesn't anymore.

00:24.134 --> 00:27.001
Ladies and gentlemen,
my wife and the love of my life.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.301
That night after your big game against Memphis,

00:35.368 --> 00:36.767
we had that party.

00:36.834 --> 00:40.167
We were pretty wasted that night.

00:40.234 --> 00:41.700
Yeah. So?

00:41.767 --> 00:44.734
Well, that was three months ago.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.900
She's three months pregnant, Nate.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.767
What do you want from me? Huh?

00:53.834 --> 00:55.667
Hi, Nathan.

00:55.734 --> 00:57.201
You need to stop this now,
Okay? Do you hear me?

00:57.267 --> 00:59.334
Why are you doing this to me?

01:27.301 --> 01:29.767
Brooke, I'm shaving.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.567
Got to go. I'm late. I have
a big day. I love you. B.

02:04.401 --> 02:06.067
I'm gonna kill you, Mouth.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.334
Alex?

02:13.401 --> 02:15.434
Oh, well, at least she's awake.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.667
Alex, come on! We got to go!

02:17.734 --> 02:20.134
Oh, my God.

02:20.201 --> 02:22.234
Keep it down.

02:22.301 --> 02:24.468
I'm so tired.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.967
You've been out all night?
I have to sleep.

02:27.034 --> 02:29.201
But the shower.

02:29.267 --> 02:31.900
I leave it on. I like the sound of the rain.

02:31.967 --> 02:33.867
Now I have to sleep. Go away.

02:33.934 --> 02:37.301
No, no. Alex, you have
a photo shoot in, like, now.

02:37.368 --> 02:38.800
You have to get up.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.368
I can't hear you.

02:40.434 --> 02:43.034
I'm asleep.

02:43.101 --> 02:45.034
Oh, there's a sheep.

02:45.101 --> 02:46.967
Hello, counting sheep.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.500
You're funny.

02:50.567 --> 02:52.767
Well, there goes your counting sheep

02:52.834 --> 02:54.700
with your half-million dollars.

02:54.767 --> 02:56.034
Bye.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.734
Can I just say that I hate you?
Mm-hmm.

03:06.067 --> 03:08.034
Oh, it's cold!

03:08.101 --> 03:10.700
You shouldn't have left it on, you jerk.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.734
Man, that guy's such a jerk.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.934
You don't do that to no brother.

03:15.001 --> 03:15.934
No.

03:16.001 --> 03:17.533
Nah, you want to strip down

03:17.600 --> 03:20.500
and parade your little flaccid
business around the apartment,

03:20.567 --> 03:21.667
That's cool.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.134
Go ahead with your naked ass.

03:24.201 --> 03:27.368
But this time, you done went too far.

03:27.434 --> 03:31.500
It's cheap, it's mean, and it's crossing the line.

03:44.401 --> 03:46.234
Okay, time to man up.

03:46.301 --> 03:49.234
Emergency situation. Life or death.

03:49.301 --> 03:51.134
What do you do?

03:51.201 --> 03:52.967
What do you do?

03:53.034 --> 03:56.700
Who do you call?

03:56.767 --> 03:58.667
Mm-hmm.

04:01.134 --> 04:04.334
Hey, yo, Jamie Scott. I need your help.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.301
McFadden.

04:10.368 --> 04:12.767
You're friends with Nathan Scott, aren't you?

04:12.834 --> 04:14.167
Yeah, old friends. Why?

04:14.234 --> 04:16.000
Anything going on with him?

04:16.067 --> 04:17.401
He's in a contract year.

04:17.468 --> 04:18.733
Right. Whatever.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.632
A friend of mine was having lunch yesterday.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.734
He said he had some sort
of a misunderstanding

04:22.800 --> 04:24.001
with a woman in a restaurant.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.334
Okay.

04:25.401 --> 04:26.800
It might be newsworthy.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.633
You're kidding, right?

04:29.767 --> 04:32.734
Well, I had a disagreement
yesterday at lunch with Jerry

04:32.800 --> 04:35.134
over who got the last slice of key lime pie.

04:35.201 --> 04:36.867
It's not exactly news.

04:36.934 --> 04:39.234
And you're not exactly newsworthy.

04:39.301 --> 04:41.800
He is. Check it out.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.034
Mouth, if there's nothing there,
there's nothing there.

04:48.101 --> 04:51.301
But I fired you'd want to be the one to find out.

05:04.401 --> 05:06.633
You know I didn't do anything, right?

05:09.334 --> 05:12.167
I did not sleep with her or do anything else.

05:12.234 --> 05:14.001
You have your arm around her.

05:16.034 --> 05:18.667
I get asked to take a lot of pictures.

05:18.734 --> 05:20.700
You have your arm around her at a party

05:20.767 --> 05:23.001
with a beer and a smile.

05:23.067 --> 05:25.468
Haley... 
I get it, Nathan.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.934
You got married in high school,

05:27.001 --> 05:28.134
and you had a son at graduation,

05:28.201 --> 05:29.368
and you didn't have time

05:29.434 --> 05:31.001
to go out and party with your friends

05:31.067 --> 05:34.167
and... drunken sluts with perfect teeth.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.934
I just took a picture with her. That's all.

05:37.001 --> 05:38.867
But it looks bad, Nathan.

05:40.134 --> 05:42.934
And she's smart enough to know that.

05:43.001 --> 05:45.401
You should be, too.

05:47.334 --> 05:50.267
What they see is who you'll be.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.734
Entertainment is news.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.967
Gossip is news.

05:57.034 --> 05:59.067
Rumor is news.

05:59.134 --> 06:00.633
And the truth... 

06:00.700 --> 06:04.167
Well... that's negotiable.

06:04.234 --> 06:05.368
Or is it?

06:07.633 --> 06:10.201
You see, I say the truth is absolute.

06:12.334 --> 06:14.401
I say the truth is not afraid.

06:14.468 --> 06:16.134
And the truth is... 

06:16.201 --> 06:18.567
You're a murderer! A murderer... 
that's what you are!

06:18.633 --> 06:20.967
Go ahead! Tell them the truth,
Dan! Tell them what you are!

06:21.034 --> 06:22.834
You're a murderer, is what you are!

06:22.900 --> 06:24.334
How do you sleep at night?!

06:24.401 --> 06:26.067
How do you look at yourself in the mirror?!

06:26.134 --> 06:29.334
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

06:29.401 --> 06:32.767
Should we cut? Mrs. Scott?
Rachel, should we cut?

06:32.834 --> 06:35.600
No. Keep rolling.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.134
But the guy called him a murderer.

06:38.201 --> 06:39.834
He called the guy a murderer.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.867
So?

06:41.934 --> 06:44.301
He is one.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.867
Hey, I'm so happy we could make this work.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.333
Haley's been showing me a ton of your work,

06:58.400 --> 06:59.534
and I am such a fan.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.767
Thank you, Brooke.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.801
You know, I wear your designs quite a bit,

07:02.867 --> 07:05.134
and I really feel like I can capture the energy

07:05.200 --> 07:07.300
that you're after with all the new designs.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.500
Plus, I am so excited to shoot Alex Dupre.

07:09.567 --> 07:10.867
I mean, what is she like?

07:10.934 --> 07:12.934
Wow. She's like...

07:14.867 --> 07:16.168
that.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.801
Alex, what happened to you?

07:18.867 --> 07:20.101
Jet lag.

07:20.168 --> 07:24.068
Jet lag, my foot.
You flew in from New York.

07:24.134 --> 07:25.901
Are you hung over?

07:25.967 --> 07:28.233
I... I just need my pills.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.068
Excuse me? You just got out of rehab.

07:30.134 --> 07:31.367
What is that?

07:31.434 --> 07:33.101
What did you just take?!

07:34.068 --> 07:35.168
Vitamins?

07:35.233 --> 07:36.400
No. No. Give it.

07:36.467 --> 07:38.200
Ew.

07:38.267 --> 07:40.200
They're just vitamins, you hags.

07:40.267 --> 07:43.434
Hags? Half a million dollars.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.168
Sit.

07:48.233 --> 07:51.567
You might want to start with
a little lying-slut remover.

07:51.634 --> 07:54.233
This is our rejuvenation cream.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.567
It does wonders for jet lag,
but it smells a little bad.

07:57.634 --> 07:59.667
Whatever. You know you farted.

07:59.734 --> 08:01.534
I did not fart.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.500
That's too bad, 'cause I just did.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.267
Tell me again what this thing look like.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.567
What's that magical thing called?

08:16.634 --> 08:18.500
I think they call him Puff.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.867
The magic dragon?

08:19.934 --> 08:23.367
Yeah, that's exactly what
it looked like... a dragon.

08:23.434 --> 08:26.233
But it was like Puff's evil twin.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.934
Oh, man.

08:31.134 --> 08:33.034
Cool.

08:36.267 --> 08:39.400
See, Mouth knows I'm scared of creatures, right?
Mm-hmm.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.933
That's why I know he did this on purpose.

08:42.001 --> 08:43.701
You think you can catch it?

08:43.767 --> 08:45.467
We can catch it.

08:45.534 --> 08:47.701
You can catch it.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.667
The new Cameron Crowe film, right?

08:52.734 --> 08:53.934
Perfect. Yeah.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.333
Okay, thanks for letting me know.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.068
Hi. Are you gonna work
on a Cameron Crowe movie?

08:58.134 --> 09:01.101
No, that was the video store. I'm just renting one.
Oh.

09:01.168 --> 09:02.534
I got coffees.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.001
Mocha double latte, extra foam.
Thank you.

09:04.068 --> 09:05.300
Mocha double latte, no foam.

09:05.367 --> 09:06.467
Thank you.

09:06.534 --> 09:08.667
And coffee, black, two sugars.

09:08.734 --> 09:09.901
I called Haley.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.767
Oh, thanks.
Julian.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.001
Quinn.
You made out in my bed.
Hey!

09:15.068 --> 09:16.068
Hey, so did you.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.901
Sorry about that.

09:19.967 --> 09:22.767
Hello. Hot P.A. boy.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.200
Hi.

09:24.267 --> 09:27.134
Oh, you must be Alex.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.734
You must be yummy.
What'd you get me?

09:30.801 --> 09:33.801
You get chocolate, perfect for alleged jet lag.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.034
Word's on the street.

09:35.101 --> 09:36.634
And the entertainment trades... 

09:36.701 --> 09:37.901
barely read.

09:37.967 --> 09:39.934
Mmm.

09:40.001 --> 09:41.333
I like him.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.567
Yeah, well, you got a little
competition on that one.

09:44.634 --> 09:46.834
Please, you're way too old for him.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.567
So...

10:02.634 --> 10:05.701
200 grand and she signs
a confidentiality agreement.

10:05.767 --> 10:08.934
She goes away, and you have
nothing to do with the kid.

10:09.001 --> 10:10.400
I already have nothing to do with the kid.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.300
It's not mine.

10:12.367 --> 10:14.034
Why is she doing this to me?

10:14.101 --> 10:15.867
Because you make a lot of money,

10:15.934 --> 10:17.667
and because you're in the middle

10:17.734 --> 10:19.701
of a very public contract negotiation

10:19.767 --> 10:21.233
with a team that cares about its image

10:21.300 --> 10:24.567
and the only team that you want to play for.

10:24.634 --> 10:27.534
Which leads me to this.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.434
Maybe we pay her.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.367
Tell me you did not just say that.

10:31.434 --> 10:33.068
I did, because I'm your agent,

10:33.134 --> 10:34.400
and I wouldn't be a very good one

10:34.467 --> 10:35.967
if I didn't  least point out the fact

10:36.034 --> 10:37.634
that she could do a hell of a lot of damage

10:37.701 --> 10:39.734
If she went public with this or filed a paternity suit.

10:39.801 --> 10:41.434
It's not true. I'll take a blood test.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.300
And by that point, the damage could be done.

10:43.367 --> 10:45.068
Nate, your next contract could be worth

10:45.134 --> 10:46.901
$18 million to $20 million minimum,

10:46.967 --> 10:48.734
Not to mention the endorsement deals

10:48.801 --> 10:51.834
that are predicated on the fact
that Nathan Scott is a good guy,

10:51.901 --> 10:54.701
he's a good father, and he's a family man.

10:54.767 --> 10:55.867
She's lying.

10:55.934 --> 10:57.034
So she's lying.

10:57.101 --> 10:58.467
You know the way it works, man.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.367
They print the accusation on the front page

11:00.434 --> 11:01.801
and the retraction on the back.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.233
If I pay her, then I'm saying that I did it.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.801
I disagree.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.400
I think you're paying a little
for a lot, and that's all.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.600
And all I'm saying is that it's a valid option

11:11.667 --> 11:15.434
we should at least consider
before she... goes public.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.300
Great. Here comes the press.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.400
Hey, Nate, Clay.
Hey.

11:20.467 --> 11:23.400
Nate, can I talk to you?
About what?

11:23.467 --> 11:25.101
Clay.

11:25.168 --> 11:27.534
I'm cool. I'll catch up with you.
Nate...

11:27.600 --> 11:30.367
I just want to talk to an old friend, okay?

11:30.434 --> 11:32.168
Okay.

11:36.534 --> 11:38.101
How you doing?

11:38.168 --> 11:39.767
That depends.

11:39.834 --> 11:41.801
Are you here as a reporter or as a friend?

11:41.867 --> 11:44.068
Well, it depends on what's going on.

11:44.134 --> 11:47.168
My station manager had
a friend in the restaurant

11:47.233 --> 11:48.801
where you had lunch yesterday... 

11:48.867 --> 11:50.467
said you were upset about something.

11:50.534 --> 11:52.767
Yeah.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.333
Listen, if you need someone to talk to,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.667
I'm here as a friend, off the cord.

11:59.634 --> 12:00.701
Off the record?

12:04.101 --> 12:05.300
There's a girl who's threatening

12:05.367 --> 12:06.667
to file a paternity suit against me

12:06.734 --> 12:08.467
unless I pay her a couple
hundred thousand dollars

12:08.534 --> 12:09.634
to keep her quiet.

12:09.701 --> 12:11.967
Geez, Nate.

12:12.034 --> 12:14.168
I'm sorry.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.101
Yeah.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.134
I didn't do it.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.634
I don't even know her.

12:18.701 --> 12:20.333
Good. I'm glad.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.068
Does Haley know?

12:22.134 --> 12:23.534
Yeah.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.134
What are you gonna do about it?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.400
I don't know.

12:28.434 --> 12:29.734
What are you gonna do about it?

12:31.934 --> 12:34.068
Nothing.

12:34.134 --> 12:35.500
Look, I should get back,

12:35.567 --> 12:38.001
but you let me know if
you need anything, okay?

12:38.068 --> 12:40.267
Yes.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.134
Mouth...

12:44.200 --> 12:46.901
Thanks.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.434
But, look, if this thing turns into something... 

12:50.500 --> 12:53.434
she files a paternity suit, whatever... 

12:53.500 --> 12:55.634
You do what you have to do.

12:55.701 --> 12:58.367
I hope it doesn't come to that.

13:01.534 --> 13:03.901
Yeah.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.634
Me too.

13:12.434 --> 13:13.867
Okay, I'm good.

13:13.934 --> 13:15.767
Why don't you two step in
for a couple of test shots?

13:15.867 --> 13:17.734
Sure. Come pose with me.

13:23.068 --> 13:24.534
Hold it.

13:27.801 --> 13:30.967
He is so cute.

13:31.034 --> 13:32.400
With big hands.

13:32.467 --> 13:35.534
He probably has a really big thingy.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.267
You do know that's Brooke's boyfriend, yes?

13:37.333 --> 13:39.267
As in "serious boyfriend."

13:39.333 --> 13:40.500
She dates a P.A.?

13:40.567 --> 13:41.767
He's not a P.A. He's a producer.

13:43.068 --> 13:45.168
Yeah, she dates the P.A.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.233
No, you said he's a producer.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.834
Mnh-mnh.

13:48.901 --> 13:51.400
As in movie producer.
No, I didn't.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.567
Julian.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.200
Julian.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.233
Oh, my God, he's Julian Baker.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.267
I heard that they were dating.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.001
Damn.

14:00.068 --> 14:01.400
Okay, she's ready.

14:01.467 --> 14:03.434
How do I look?
Oh, fabulous.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.367
I didn't ask the help.
How do I look, Millie?

14:05.434 --> 14:07.801
You want my opinion?
Of course.

14:07.867 --> 14:10.233
You're the only one who tells me
the frickin' truth around here.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.701
You look amazing.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.801
I know.

14:14.901 --> 14:16.400
I'm such a slut.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.834
All right, bitches.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.834
Let's do this.

14:21.901 --> 14:23.367
I hate her.

14:23.434 --> 14:24.634
Yeah.

15:07.367 --> 15:11.200
Let's talk about today's disruption.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.534
That man wasn't wrong.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.300
We were talking about the truth,

15:15.367 --> 15:18.867
and what he said... was true.

15:18.934 --> 15:20.834
I am a murderer.

15:24.101 --> 15:27.101
But I won't hide from that.

15:27.168 --> 15:29.467
I can't hide from that.

15:32.034 --> 15:33.801
I step...

15:33.867 --> 15:37.434
into the harsh light...

15:37.500 --> 15:40.001
of the truth.

15:40.068 --> 15:43.333
Because when you stand in the light...

15:43.400 --> 15:45.200
You get yourself right.

15:45.267 --> 15:47.267
You find forgiveness.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.600
You find happiness.

15:50.667 --> 15:54.200
You find love.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.767
I found love.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.200
You all remember my producer, Rachel,

15:59.267 --> 16:01.200
who also happens to be my wife.

16:10.101 --> 16:11.801
I remember the night we met.

16:11.867 --> 16:14.834
It was so romantic.

16:14.901 --> 16:17.434
Incredibly romantic.

16:26.701 --> 16:28.233
Dan Scott?

16:28.300 --> 16:30.500
Nice ass.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.967
Our courtship was old-fashioned...

16:34.767 --> 16:35.801
Whew!

16:35.867 --> 16:38.134
... chaste.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.834
Not bad for a guy with a bad heart.

16:39.901 --> 16:42.267
Well, spend the night, and
we'll see if you can kill me.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.434
It'll cost you...

16:43.500 --> 16:44.534
a lot.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.934
It's okay.

16:46.001 --> 16:47.767
I'm rich, and I'm dying.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.400
Works for me.

16:52.101 --> 16:54.967
He had all of the things I was interested in.

16:55.034 --> 16:56.967
So did you, sweetheart.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.599
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, man.

17:07.666 --> 17:10.068
You sure you don't want
to use the net or something?

17:10.134 --> 17:11.767
That thing is terrible.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.300
I think I'll be okay.

17:13.367 --> 17:16.034
So, how come Mouth wants you to move out?

17:16.101 --> 17:17.333
It's just that he want this place

17:17.400 --> 17:18.534
all to himself with Millie.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.134
You can move into Miss Lauren's.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.901
Yeah, I... wait, listen, man.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.934
Now, we gonna catch this thing or what?

17:24.001 --> 17:25.800
I'm not so sure anymore.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.901
I might need a little convincing.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.701
Forget it.
Okay.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.667
I guess it'll just have to stay in the bathtub.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.634
Okay, okay.

17:35.701 --> 17:37.567
Uh, here's 10 bucks.

17:37.634 --> 17:40.001
Which is just enough to catch a mouse

17:40.068 --> 17:42.034
or maybe a guinea pig.

17:45.134 --> 17:47.634
Now, that's dragon money.

17:47.701 --> 17:49.534
Okay, wait here.
Okay.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.967
Wait, hold on. Be careful.

17:54.467 --> 17:55.534
Look out!

18:02.367 --> 18:04.534
I named him Percy.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.101
You're doing great, Alex.
Do you need anything?

18:10.168 --> 18:12.734
Just some more water, please. Thank you.

18:24.534 --> 18:26.233
You're looking at that thing

18:26.300 --> 18:28.267
like there's a ghost calling you.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.967
There is.

18:30.034 --> 18:32.600
Husband troubles.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.034
I'm sorry.

18:34.101 --> 18:35.400
Yeah, me too.

18:35.467 --> 18:38.701
You know, you and Julian seem so happy.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.001
Mm, we are.

18:41.068 --> 18:42.934
But I think he's bored out of his mind.

18:43.001 --> 18:44.834
He just gave up a movie to be with me.

18:44.901 --> 18:46.634
And I'm sure he's glad that he did.

18:46.701 --> 18:49.001
You know, in our case,
I think part of the problem

18:49.068 --> 18:51.068
was knowing what to give up for each other

18:51.134 --> 18:52.734
and what to hold onto for ourselves.

18:57.434 --> 18:59.701
Yeah.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.834
Hi.

19:09.901 --> 19:11.600
Hi.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.901
I'm sorry.

19:15.434 --> 19:17.600
I know.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.767
I just wish there was a way
to make all this go away.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.367
There is.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.734
You want to pay her?!

19:25.801 --> 19:28.001
You know full well this lying
whore didn't sleep with Nathan,

19:28.068 --> 19:29.667
and you want to pay her $200,000?!

19:29.734 --> 19:30.934
Whoa, I don't want to.

19:31.001 --> 19:32.967
I simply suggest that it was an option.

19:33.034 --> 19:35.101
It's not an option, Clay.

19:35.168 --> 19:36.634
And while we're suggesting things,

19:36.701 --> 19:38.567
let me suggest that you are a the reason

19:38.634 --> 19:40.300
why this is happening right now.
Ok.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.101
You love it... the parties, the women... 

19:42.168 --> 19:44.901
and you love having Nathan alongside
you more than anything else.

19:44.967 --> 19:46.567
That's not fair.
No?

19:46.634 --> 19:48.834
The picture... the one of that woman

19:48.901 --> 19:50.801
draped all over my husband... 

19:50.867 --> 19:52.567
What party was that at, Clay?

19:52.634 --> 19:54.200
Who threw that party?

19:54.267 --> 19:57.467
I'm not saying you don't love
him, 'cause I know you do,

19:57.534 --> 20:00.934
but you love having him at your
side more than anything else.

20:01.001 --> 20:03.367
You could have protected him from this.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.400
How, Haley? He's a grown man.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.267
So are you.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.867
Start acting like it.

20:19.401 --> 20:21.367
I don't think it's very fair... 

20:21.434 --> 20:24.134
that Mouth wants you to move out, I mean.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.467
Man, how could you even look at that thing?

20:26.534 --> 20:27.734
Ugh!

20:27.801 --> 20:28.900
It's cool.

20:28.967 --> 20:31.667
It's gross. That's what it is.

20:31.734 --> 20:33.401
You sure it ain't gonna get out?

20:33.467 --> 20:34.567
I'm sure.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.933
All right.

20:37.634 --> 20:40.501
Anyway, thanks for seeing things my way, man.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.134
Good looking out, bro.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.601
I just think it's your place, too.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.467
That's what I'm saying.

20:46.534 --> 20:48.100
Well, what did he say?

20:48.167 --> 20:50.067
What?

20:50.134 --> 20:52.567
When you told him this was your
place, too, what did he say?

20:53.933 --> 20:56.900
Oh, well, I didn't exactly
get to talk to him about it.

20:56.967 --> 20:58.768
Look, I didn't have time.

20:58.834 --> 21:00.067
He stripped off his drawer

21:00.134 --> 21:01.534
and I had to fight fire with fire.

21:01.601 --> 21:02.801
You guys are weird.

21:02.868 --> 21:04.900
Anyway, he already know that if I move out,

21:04.967 --> 21:07.234
Miss Lauren gonna want me to move in with her,

21:07.300 --> 21:08.701
or get a place of our own,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.801
and I do not need that kind of pressure.

21:10.868 --> 21:12.567
Well, don't you like Miss Lauren?

21:12.634 --> 21:15.167
Of course I do. I love Miss Lauren.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.501
Well, if you love her,

21:16.567 --> 21:18.534
why wouldn't you want to be with her?

21:18.601 --> 21:20.334
Dude, I brought you over here

21:20.401 --> 21:22.701
to help me catch this little dragony thing,

21:22.768 --> 21:25.801
not to give me grief about my commitment issues.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.933
Now, come on. Let's get you home.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.367
Okay.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.967
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
What about the thing?

21:34.033 --> 21:35.267
What about it?

21:35.334 --> 21:37.834
Its name is Percy, and it eats bugs and stuff.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.467
No, no, no, no, no.

21:39.534 --> 21:41.801
You catch it, you keep it.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.134
I already have Chester.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.434
Maybe you can trade Percy in at the pet store

21:45.501 --> 21:47.234
and get something else.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.200
Either way, you should talk to Mouth.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.067
He is your friend.

22:07.401 --> 22:09.434
I'm sorry.

22:09.501 --> 22:12.033
Everything you said was true.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.768
I love Lauren and you and Jamie.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.933
And I should have done better
by all of you, and I'm sorry.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.434
We're not paying her.

22:20.501 --> 22:23.834
And if that's what you decide,
then of course we're not.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.634
But it's not my dream, and it's not your dream.

22:26.701 --> 22:29.501
In part it is, but this is Nathan's dream.

22:29.567 --> 22:31.834
He's worked so damn hard for it,

22:31.900 --> 22:34.900
and he deserves it, and I just want to protect it.

22:34.967 --> 22:37.467
I mean, for him and for you.

22:39.434 --> 22:41.768
This isn't fair.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.534
I know it's not, but if paying this woman

22:44.601 --> 22:47.067
the money he makes off one commercial

22:47.134 --> 22:49.267
protects Jamie from all of this,

22:49.334 --> 22:51.768
if it keeps his name safe and his career safe

22:51.834 --> 22:54.768
and you both finally get what
you've been chasing forever,

22:54.834 --> 22:57.768
I think it's something we should consider.

23:06.367 --> 23:09.167
It's not fair, Hales.

23:09.234 --> 23:12.434
But none of this is.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.967
Do you believe in redemption?

23:24.034 --> 23:25.867
I believe in money.

23:27.467 --> 23:29.868
So what's your story, anyway?

23:30.701 --> 23:33.134
Just hang out in strip clubs, waiting to die?

23:35.868 --> 23:37.367
Could be worse.

23:37.434 --> 23:40.834
Could be better.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.534
* just a matter of time *

23:46.567 --> 23:48.434
Lucas' novel.

23:48.501 --> 23:49.601
Yeah.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.534
Reminds me of who I used to be.

23:51.601 --> 23:54.367
You do know you're the villain in this?

23:54.434 --> 23:57.200
The villain has power.

23:57.267 --> 23:59.300
I'm in here.

23:59.367 --> 24:01.134
I'm naked on the river court.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.933
I know. Page 88. It's bookmarked.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.501
* ...might take its own course *

24:10.567 --> 24:12.634
So, what's with the self-help books?

24:12.701 --> 24:15.267
Best seller.

24:15.334 --> 24:18.134
Best seller.

24:18.234 --> 24:21.567
People are so lazy.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.000
Instead of changing their bad habits,

24:24.067 --> 24:25.334
they just buy a book.

24:25.401 --> 24:28.334
No, people aren't lazy.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.367
They're afraid.

24:30.434 --> 24:32.601
They're afraid of dying

24:32.667 --> 24:35.033
without leaving their mark on t world.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.900
'Cause they're lazy.

24:36.967 --> 24:38.334
What about you?

24:38.401 --> 24:40.534
Hmm.

24:40.601 --> 24:42.134
I left my mark on the world.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.634
I just can't seem to die.

24:44.701 --> 24:46.933
But I do know one thing.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.134
* know that we've tried *

24:50.200 --> 24:51.868
If people saw my life,

24:51.967 --> 24:54.801
they'd feel a lot better about theirs.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.667
* it might scatter and fade *

24:59.534 --> 25:03.334
* with time *

25:03.401 --> 25:05.534
* all things must change *

25:08.000 --> 25:09.501
* the road... *

25:09.567 --> 25:11.967
You want to get out of here?

25:12.033 --> 25:14.033
* ...might take its own course *

25:14.100 --> 25:15.401
I can't.

25:15.467 --> 25:17.434
Re you can.

25:17.501 --> 25:19.334
We both can.

25:19.401 --> 25:22.300
* mama, we're still your boys *

25:22.367 --> 25:23.300
Hey.

25:24.734 --> 25:26.667
Don't drink that.

25:32.434 --> 25:34.534
I need you.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.834
* and you gave it all back to us *

25:47.534 --> 25:48.900
Hi.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.334
Thanks for the trades.

25:50.401 --> 25:52.634
I was going crazy without
news from the real world.

25:52.701 --> 25:54.601
This is the real world, Alex.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.267
Not for us.

25:56.334 --> 25:58.601
Well, it's too bad about
your last movie falling apart,

25:58.667 --> 26:00.134
You were good in it.
Oh, my God.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.801
Those wigs made your head so itchy.

26:01.868 --> 26:05.300
After every take, I was like, "uhh!"

26:07.100 --> 26:09.967
Oh, crap. I'm stuck in my extensions.

26:10.033 --> 26:11.167
A little help?

26:16.467 --> 26:18.434
So, how come you're not doing
that movie in New Zealand?

26:18.501 --> 26:20.434
Ow. I slept with a couple actors on it.

26:20.501 --> 26:21.567
And a few crew guys.

26:21.634 --> 26:22.868
Maybe at the same time.

26:22.933 --> 26:24.933
Anyway, how me you're not doing it?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.300
I'm... just looking for something else.

26:28.367 --> 26:31.334
Well... I have something else you might like.

26:34.067 --> 26:36.067
Thanks.

26:36.134 --> 26:38.967
P.S. You're totally cute.

26:47.967 --> 26:50.100
Hey.

26:50.167 --> 26:51.200
Hi.

26:51.267 --> 26:52.933
How's she doing?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.701
Your sister? She's amazing.

26:55.768 --> 26:57.033
And believe it or not,

26:57.100 --> 26:59.300
this knucklehead actress
might actually be worth it.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.434
Oh, great.

27:00.501 --> 27:02.501
How you doing?

27:02.567 --> 27:04.100
Good.

27:08.267 --> 27:10.868
Haley?

27:13.267 --> 27:14.667
Not good.

27:21.434 --> 27:23.434
Everything was going so great for us,

27:23.501 --> 27:25.100
and this woman comes along

27:25.167 --> 27:26.234
and just turns our whole world upside down.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.067
Hales, you know I've been in
the tabloids as much as anybody.

27:29.134 --> 27:30.434
They lie all the time.

27:30.501 --> 27:32.601
And people will give Nathan
the benefit of the doubt.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.100
You know that, Haley Bob.

27:34.167 --> 27:37.134
Unless he did it.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.200
My best friend Katie accused this guy

27:39.267 --> 27:40.367
of getting her pregnant,

27:40.434 --> 27:41.701
and it turns out he totally did it.

27:41.768 --> 27:43.401
He had to give her like a butt load of money,

27:43.467 --> 27:45.167
and then she got an abortion

27:45.234 --> 27:47.868
and bought the raddest fur coat.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.467
Like way rad.

27:52.701 --> 27:53.734
We need a drink.

27:53.801 --> 27:54.768
Yeah.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.234
Not you.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.868
Millicent, come get her!

28:06.701 --> 28:08.667
McFadden.

28:08.734 --> 28:10.501
Hey, what's the story with Nathan Scott?

28:11.834 --> 28:14.100
Nothing.

28:14.167 --> 28:16.033
There is no story.

28:19.601 --> 28:21.200
Here's my problem with paying her.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.567
It's not the money.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.667
I mean, it is the money, but what if it comes out

28:24.734 --> 28:27.200
that we paid some pregnant
lady to buy her silence?

28:27.267 --> 28:29.200
She would never be able to talk about it.

28:29.267 --> 28:31.501
She'd have to sign a confidentiality agreement.

28:31.567 --> 28:33.100
What gonna stop her from doing that?

28:33.167 --> 28:34.701
I mean, since wee clearly dealing

28:34.768 --> 28:36.634
with such a trustworthy human being.
Right.

28:36.701 --> 28:38.033
I don't understand.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.834
The woman claims that she's pregnant, you know,

28:39.900 --> 28:41.933
and that Nathan's the father,
but in this day and age,

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
you can prove that kind of
thing so easily, you know,

28:44.067 --> 28:47.434
with an amniocentesis or
eventually a blood test, so...

28:47.501 --> 28:48.768
He didn't do it.

28:48.834 --> 28:51.933
He said he didn't do it, so I believe him.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.200
Okay, of course, but then...

28:53.267 --> 28:56.100
Look, she's hoping that Nathan caves.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.434
She's pregnant, she doesn't have any money,

28:58.501 --> 29:00.967
and she knows that Nathan Scott has a lot to lose,

29:01.033 --> 29:02.234
so why not take a shot?

29:02.300 --> 29:03.601
I say you call her bluff

29:03.667 --> 29:05.601
and don't pay the dumb bitch a dime.

29:05.667 --> 29:08.067
That's what I said, but it's gonna go public,

29:08.134 --> 29:09.501
and it's gonna affect Jamie,

29:09.567 --> 29:12.100
and Nathan's basketball contract is up for renewal.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.334
Hi.

29:13.401 --> 29:14.701
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.534
I'll be right back.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.933
Alex, you can't drink those.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.634
Fine! But love tequila.

29:27.701 --> 29:29.967
Used to. Here.

29:30.033 --> 29:32.334
You drink them, and I'll just have the lime.

29:32.401 --> 29:33.701
No.

29:33.768 --> 29:35.900
Please? Pretty, pretty, pretty please?

29:40.367 --> 29:41.868
Mmm.

29:41.933 --> 29:46.601
* now the ocean tides come up with the moon *

29:46.667 --> 29:48.967
* I'm afraid we're all living... *

29:49.033 --> 29:50.033
Ugh! Nice!

29:50.134 --> 29:51.567
Are we drunk yet?

29:53.634 --> 29:54.768
We're buzzed.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.667
Oh, I miss being buzzed.

29:56.734 --> 29:58.768
Okay, don't tell any of the
boys that I'm sober.

29:58.834 --> 30:00.334
That way, if I do anything slutty,

30:00.401 --> 30:01.601
I can still blame the booze.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.067
Thanks, Millie. See ya.

30:06.534 --> 30:08.567
So, the photo shoot went well?

30:08.634 --> 30:10.334
It went great, actually.

30:10.401 --> 30:13.734
This one's kind of good at
her job for being a James.

30:13.801 --> 30:15.501
Former James.

30:15.567 --> 30:18.167
Possibly future James.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.200
But thank you.

30:20.267 --> 30:23.601
You know, I used to make Haley
Bob pose for me all the time.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.501
Remember, Hales?

30:28.701 --> 30:31.167
Sorry. I'm sorry, you guys.

30:31.234 --> 30:34.667
I really appreciate this, but
I'm gonna go talk to Nathan.

30:34.734 --> 30:36.267
I'll catch up with you later.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.567
Hey.

30:37.634 --> 30:40.067
I'm here for anything.

30:40.134 --> 30:41.601
I know. Thank you.

30:41.667 --> 30:43.100
I'll see you at home.

30:43.167 --> 30:44.501
Ok.

30:47.200 --> 30:48.267
You know what?

30:48.334 --> 30:49.667
I should probably go get some work done.

30:49.734 --> 30:51.134
Do you want to go?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.534
No, I think I'm gonna stay here.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.267
Do you want to talk about it?

30:55.334 --> 30:58.868
Truthfully, I want to drink about it.

30:58.933 --> 31:00.634
Okay.

31:00.701 --> 31:02.601
You did great work today, Quinn.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.401
Thank you so much, Brooke.

31:04.467 --> 31:06.000
Yeah.

31:06.067 --> 31:10.933
* till the family relents and you get yourself pissed *

31:11.000 --> 31:15.200
* and suddenly everyone has got some advice *

31:15.267 --> 31:20.100
* you sell their suggestions without thinking twice *

31:22.033 --> 31:24.334
Mouth.

31:24.401 --> 31:26.534
Yeah, ha ha, very funny.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.933
You got me good, too, man.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.868
No, I did not scream like a little girl.

31:30.933 --> 31:33.501
No, I did not.

31:33.567 --> 31:35.667
Yeah, well, you would scream like a little girl, too,

31:35.734 --> 31:37.134
if a reptile ambushed you like that.

31:39.067 --> 31:42.000
Look, anyway, I want to call a truce.

31:42.100 --> 31:46.234
So, we need to talk when
you get home later, all right?

31:46.300 --> 31:48.567
* ...was born in the spring *

31:48.634 --> 31:51.167
No, it was just something Jamie said.

31:51.234 --> 31:52.868
* born in the spring *

31:52.933 --> 31:54.501
So, I guess I'll see you later,

31:54.567 --> 31:56.701
and I guess I'll try and explain it to you.

31:56.768 --> 31:59.000
* born in the spring *

31:59.067 --> 32:00.401
All right, bro.

32:00.467 --> 32:01.467
All right. Later.

32:01.534 --> 32:04.300
* born in the spring *

32:06.701 --> 32:09.134
* 'cause everyone's gone *

32:09.200 --> 32:11.601
* we all die, don't you know? *

32:11.667 --> 32:16.434
* are you so disappointed that it all was a show? *

32:16.501 --> 32:19.567
* and the first love you had was the only thing real *

32:19.634 --> 32:21.701
How am I gonna explain this to him?

32:21.768 --> 32:24.501
* and we're brought here together... *

32:24.567 --> 32:26.234
Maybe you won't have to.

32:28.367 --> 32:30.501
* still I wish that I... *

32:30.567 --> 32:33.300
I... I hate that somebody can do this to you

32:33.367 --> 32:35.401
and get away with it, Nathan... I do.

32:35.467 --> 32:38.067
But...

32:38.134 --> 32:39.933
you're the one who fought as hard as you did

32:40.000 --> 32:41.267
to get where you are now,

32:41.334 --> 32:43.267
And you're the one who never gave up yourself,

32:43.334 --> 32:45.534
so...

32:45.601 --> 32:47.734
if you want to make this hole thing go away,

32:47.801 --> 32:50.701
then you do that,

32:50.768 --> 32:53.000
and I won't speak of it again.

33:14.300 --> 33:17.801
Let me get a dixie and a shot of tequila, chilled.

33:17.868 --> 33:19.868
I love tequila.

33:19.933 --> 33:21.401
Used to.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.667
Doesn't go too well with rehab.

33:23.734 --> 33:25.734
Alex Dupre, right?
Right.

33:25.801 --> 33:27.933
And you're that boy who owns
the big house on the beach.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.267
I'm the boy that rents
that big house on the beach.

33:30.334 --> 33:31.300
Clay.

33:31.367 --> 33:32.634
Hi.

33:32.701 --> 33:34.434
Uh...

33:34.501 --> 33:36.900
Go ahead. Just do it quick.

33:36.967 --> 33:38.501
* ...with a degree pushing buttons *

33:38.567 --> 33:40.734
* he really played to win, man *

33:40.801 --> 33:43.267
* yeah, he'd never give up nothing *

33:43.334 --> 33:46.834
* something in his eyes said, "why are you all laughing?" *

33:46.900 --> 33:48.501
I miss that.

33:48.567 --> 33:51.100
The kissing or the drinking?

33:52.367 --> 33:54.334
Yes.

33:54.401 --> 33:55.834
Wow.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.067
You're a piece of work.

33:58.134 --> 34:00.501
My sister's in tears, my
brother-in-law's unemployed,

34:00.567 --> 34:02.900
and you're sucking face
with dumb girls at the bar.

34:02.967 --> 34:05.334
Wow, your husband must be so happy right now.

34:07.367 --> 34:09.634
I'm sorry. That was unfair.

34:09.701 --> 34:13.199
Yeah, it has been one of those days.

34:14.667 --> 34:17.234
How you holding up?

34:17.300 --> 34:21.300
If I was one of your clients,
I'd be listed as "day to day

34:21.367 --> 34:23.434
Aren't we all?

34:29.900 --> 34:30.801
Lauren.

34:33.367 --> 34:35.868
Okay. I'll take care of it.

34:40.634 --> 34:41.734
Hey, Clay?

34:43.134 --> 34:45.134
I hope you know what you're doing.

34:45.199 --> 34:46.601
You too.

34:48.501 --> 34:50.701
I can be in your bed in 20 minutes.

34:50.768 --> 34:52.567
Make it 30.

34:56.067 --> 34:58.134
Really?

34:58.200 --> 35:00.200
You're that guy?

35:00.267 --> 35:02.100
I am tonight.

35:10.834 --> 35:14.167
What's on your mind, baby?

35:14.234 --> 35:15.667
Oh.

35:18.334 --> 35:21.667
I'm sorry what happened today
with that man in the crowd

35:21.734 --> 35:25.300
you work so hard for me and...
and the show, and I just...

35:27.367 --> 35:28.967
I'm sorry.

35:29.033 --> 35:30.667
I'm not.

35:30.734 --> 35:32.734
I hired him to do it.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.067
Why?

35:35.134 --> 35:39.134
Because you can't hide
from what you did, Dan.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.300
And because whenever we shine
a light on your mistakes,

35:42.367 --> 35:43.834
you fight back,

35:43.900 --> 35:46.234
and that inspires people.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.834
Besides, it makes for good tv.

36:03.000 --> 36:03.967
Hi.

36:04.033 --> 36:06.200
Alex.

36:06.267 --> 36:07.734
What can I do for you?

36:07.801 --> 36:10.000
You said you were looking
for something different.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.567
Look, Alex, I...

36:12.634 --> 36:14.933
I know what you're thinking.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.801
You're thinking I'm hot,
and you're also thinking

36:17.868 --> 36:20.634
the dumb actress just gave you a stupid script,

36:20.701 --> 36:22.900
but it's not stupid, and I'm not dumb.

36:24.134 --> 36:26.401
Okay, well, I'm a little dumb,

36:26.467 --> 36:28.534
but I know a good script when I read it.

36:30.367 --> 36:32.534
Okay. I'll take a look.

36:35.401 --> 36:38.434
Hey, when I said I had
something different for you,

36:38.501 --> 36:40.334
You thought I meant me, huh?

36:40.401 --> 36:44.067
Um... no. Some other boy gets me tonight.

36:44.134 --> 36:45.933
But we can totally meet up after if you want.

36:48.134 --> 36:49.567
That's okay. I'm good.

36:49.634 --> 36:51.801
Yeah. I'll bet you are.

36:51.868 --> 36:55.601
* suddenly *

36:55.667 --> 36:58.701
* we decompose *

37:07.900 --> 37:09.501
Answer it, Quinn.

37:11.567 --> 37:14.334
You're gonna have to talk to me sometime.

37:22.667 --> 37:24.834
Well, at least you're wearing pants.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.033
Look, if I move out,

37:26.100 --> 37:28.401
Lauren gonna want me to move in with her.

37:28.501 --> 37:29.701
So what? You love Lauren.

37:29.768 --> 37:32.100
I know, but, look, first we move in together,

37:32.167 --> 37:34.334
and then she gonna want to get married.

37:34.401 --> 37:37.200
And, man, we even ain't
even gotten into that yet.

37:37.267 --> 37:39.701
Look, I'm not even sure
if I ever want to get married.

37:39.768 --> 37:42.933
And I'm not saying that I don't
love Lauren, because I do.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.300
I'm just not sure what I want to do yet.

37:45.367 --> 37:47.033
Well, you should have said that.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.967
Yeah, well, you should have asked.

37:51.367 --> 37:54.367
You're a good roommate, Skills, and a good friend.

37:54.434 --> 37:56.768
You stay as long as you want, all right?

37:56.834 --> 38:00.200
* came to life *

38:00.267 --> 38:01.933
All right.

38:04.467 --> 38:06.768
* reaction time *

38:12.601 --> 38:14.534
* we're allowed *

38:26.267 --> 38:29.701
* so we all *

38:29.768 --> 38:32.200
* are growing old *

38:39.367 --> 38:41.534
I didn't expect her to be such a mess.

38:41.601 --> 38:43.000
I'm sorry about that.

38:43.067 --> 38:46.200
No, me too, but I'll tell you what... the camera loves her.

38:46.267 --> 38:50.167
She looks healthy and smart...

38:50.234 --> 38:52.234
happy.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.134
Hmm.

38:54.200 --> 39:00.267
* and don't be afraid of the cold *

39:18.134 --> 39:19.768
I appreciate you meeting me.

39:19.834 --> 39:22.467
I just want what's fair.

39:22.534 --> 39:23.834
Yeah.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.701
This is, uh...

39:25.768 --> 39:27.467
this is the amount that we're willing to pay

39:27.534 --> 39:29.334
to make this go away.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.967
It's empty.

39:37.033 --> 39:38.300
That's right.

39:38.367 --> 39:41.000
It's empty because you're a lying bitch,

39:41.067 --> 39:43.200
and we're not paying you a dime.

39:43.267 --> 39:45.434
Go to hell.

39:47.267 --> 39:49.567
* we cry *

39:49.634 --> 39:51.467
* cry *

39:51.534 --> 39:54.768
* we cry *

39:54.834 --> 39:57.100
* we slide *

39:57.167 --> 39:59.234
* we slide *

39:59.300 --> 40:03.467
* we'll slide into the light *

40:03.534 --> 40:05.634
He talked to her.

40:05.701 --> 40:07.900
It didn't go well.

40:09.567 --> 40:11.033
It's gonna get worse.

40:13.234 --> 40:15.933
I should talk to Jamie.

40:34.801 --> 40:38.100
* sing, fight *

40:38.167 --> 40:42.734
* we'll slide into the light *

40:42.801 --> 40:47.067
* maybe we're sealed in silence *

40:47.134 --> 40:51.033
* and maybe we feel a guidance *

40:51.100 --> 40:54.667
* maybe your own devices *

40:54.734 --> 40:57.734
* will keep you afraid of the cold *

40:57.801 --> 40:59.534
* afraid of the time *

40:59.601 --> 41:04.801
* you've got nowhere to go but here *
