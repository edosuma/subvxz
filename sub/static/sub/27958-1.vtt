you may be sure,

00:48.265 --> 00:50.746

to all of this.

"As they spoke,
a royal coach drove up

And there you have it, The Frog Prince.

01:12.550 --> 01:13.812
Still one of my favorites.

01:13.856 --> 01:15.249
I hope you all enjoyed it

01:15.292 --> 01:18.078
as much as I enjoyed
sharing it with you.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.081
And let'’s all show Miss Marks
how much we enjoyed

01:21.124 --> 01:23.300
having her read to us
this semester.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.178
Thank you so much
for your help.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.049
Good luck on your interview.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.137
Thank you.

01:40.970 --> 01:44.365
Finished top of your class.
Good.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.715
The City Literacy Program,
what'’s that?

01:46.758 --> 01:48.717
They send volunteers
to read with kids

01:48.760 --> 01:50.197
in inner-city schools.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.546
All through law school?

01:51.589 --> 01:53.113
Yes.
You had time?

01:53.156 --> 01:56.159
Uh, well, yeah,
I made the time.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.379
I love working with children.

01:58.422 --> 02:02.122
Maggie, let me
be really clear.

02:02.165 --> 02:05.821
We need somebody
razor sharp, focused,
committed 200%

02:05.864 --> 02:08.170
rain or shine.
Absolutely.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.695
Once you'’re on the team,
there isn'’t time
for much else.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.523
Are we clear on that?

02:12.567 --> 02:14.612
Clear as rain.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.831
I mean glass.

02:15.874 --> 02:19.139
I mean...
Very, very clear.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.711
That was tough.
A lot tougher than I expected.

02:26.755 --> 02:29.366
She was just testing you.
They'’re a top firm.

02:29.410 --> 02:30.759
They'’re weeding out the weak.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.369
That'’s me, the weak.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.502
No, you are not.

02:34.545 --> 02:37.026
They want commitment,
you can commit.

02:37.069 --> 02:40.334
Honestly, I don'’t know
if I'’m cut out for this.

02:40.377 --> 02:43.424
So you try a smaller outfit,
something more boutique.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.643
Yeah, that'’ll go over
really well with my dad.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.950
"Boutique is for shoes.
You need a top firm."

02:47.993 --> 02:49.908
Okay, I'’m no lawyer,
but there are...

02:49.952 --> 02:51.171
It'’s not just that.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.911
The bigger question is,

02:52.955 --> 02:55.958
do I really wanna be
cooped up in an office 24/7,

02:56.001 --> 02:58.743
surrounded by guys,
yes, mostly guys,

02:58.787 --> 03:00.310

up to partner

03:00.354 --> 03:02.356
while doing meaningless work
that helps no one

03:02.399 --> 03:06.055
but some corporation'’s
bottom line for years?

03:06.098 --> 03:07.622
You know what?

03:07.665 --> 03:10.146
You are stressed out.
You'’re exhausted.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.236
It'’s not the best time
to be making life decisions.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.412
Which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.155
Come to Europe with me.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.722
What? No.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.724
Why not?
Even if I could,

03:22.767 --> 03:24.987
I cannot handle
your friend Jenny
for two weeks.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.816
And that'’s just it.
Jenny canceled.
She got a job.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.905
[SIGHS] That'’s what
I need, a job.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.907
Look, they said they'’d get
back to you in two weeks.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.474
It'’s the perfect time
for a getaway.

03:33.517 --> 03:36.607
I got it all set.
All you need to do is show up.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.436
Trust me, you'’ll have
way more fun without me.

03:39.480 --> 03:43.266
Maggie Marks, when'’s
the last time you had fun?

03:43.310 --> 03:45.616
From LSATs through law school,
the bar exam,

03:45.660 --> 03:48.402
you'’ve had your head
in the books for how
many years now?

03:48.445 --> 03:50.186
You'’re the spontaneous
one, not me.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.320
It'’s not you, which
is exactly why

03:53.363 --> 03:55.278
you should do it.
You said so yourself.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.193
Don'’t you wanna
live a little

03:57.237 --> 03:58.934
before it'’s all
billable hours,

03:58.977 --> 04:01.719

in an office 24/7?

Where are you going again?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.945

Where'’s that?

04:09.988 --> 04:13.514
Europe. It'’s southwest
of the French Alps.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.298
Here we go.
Big enough?

04:15.342 --> 04:18.822
Yeah, that'’s perfect.
Thanks, Mom.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.564
And you'’d be gone
two whole weeks?

04:20.608 --> 04:22.523
What if they want you
back for a follow-up interview

04:22.566 --> 04:24.046
while you'’re away?

04:24.089 --> 04:25.917
[SCOFFS] Then you'’ll buy her
a new return ticket.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.658
You can afford it.

You might even meet
a nice European gentleman.

Mom, please.
That is the last thing
I need right now.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.114
She needs
to focus on work.She needs a break.

04:49.158 --> 04:51.682
Oh, hang on.
I have something
else for you.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.430
[SIGHS] I did try my best.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.346
You had one tough interview.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.131

Please don'’t, Dad.

you wanna help

but you gotta let me
do this.

I don'’t know.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.972
Of course you'’re anxious.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.018
It'’s natural.

But you'’re the toughest

followed by a meeting with
the chief of staff at 12:55.

He requested the full hour
to review your

with the tailor and his team

Good morning, Dory,

07:22.311 --> 07:26.097

07:26.141 --> 07:29.405

07:34.323 --> 07:36.281
This is ridiculous.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.588
She was a tourist.
I was giving her directions.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.590
Well, you certainly seem
very happy doing it.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.114
Mother, seriously...
Adrian, you have
to be careful,

07:43.158 --> 07:45.029
especially with
your coronation coming up.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.815
More so than ever,
you represent
not only our family,

07:47.858 --> 07:49.773
but the entire country.

07:49.817 --> 07:53.734
So we want to present
Calpurnians as what, exactly?

07:53.777 --> 07:55.866

who are rude to tourists?

07:55.910 --> 07:58.303
Don'’t dare be daft.
You know exactly what I mean.

07:58.347 --> 08:01.611
I want you to limit
your gallivanting about town

08:01.655 --> 08:03.831
in this last stretch
before the coronation.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.615
I'’m not staying cooped up
in here for a week

08:05.659 --> 08:07.748
because some trashy tabloid
prints lies.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.098
Your father,
may he rest in peace,

08:10.141 --> 08:12.622
had a wonderful saying,
"Sacrifice in..."

08:12.666 --> 08:15.059
"Sacrifice in service
of your country
is not sacrifice."

08:15.103 --> 08:17.018
Yes. I don'’t think
he meant it to include

08:17.061 --> 08:18.672
house arrest for his son.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.805
Very well.
In that case, I must insist

be open to the public?

If not for them,
we wouldn'’t have a country.

I guess that qualifies
as an adventure.

Did the store have
the same one?

13:05.045 --> 13:08.309
I will tell you
on one condition.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.180
It'’s an ancient
Calpurnian custom

13:10.224 --> 13:13.488
that a knight on horseback
who rudely tramples
a lady'’s hat

13:13.531 --> 13:15.403
buys her a latte.

13:15.446 --> 13:19.233
That'’s cute,
but I gotta run.

forgetting something?

for another thank you...

Give me that back.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.467
How did you do that?

A magician never reveals
his secrets,

with very strong coffee.

less spontaneous
than right now.

it to mystery.

meet me at the fountain

our little kingdom.

as a framework
for this draft.

Yes! Like it was expected
of me to be a lawyer,

so I never really gave
anything else a try.

at this interview

desperate for a job

21:03.827 --> 21:06.003
I need the salary,

21:06.047 --> 21:08.354
and to be fair,
my parents did give up a lot

21:08.397 --> 21:09.833
for me to get to this point.

21:09.877 --> 21:13.837
Ah, yes, never underestimate
the power of parental guilt.

21:13.881 --> 21:18.233

to be a doctor.

Uh, no.

else expects me to take over,

of money from the royal trust,

I believe your father,

may he rest in peace,

45:08.053 --> 45:10.446

is an inverse correlation

45:10.490 --> 45:12.535
between how long
a monarch has ruled

45:12.579 --> 45:15.843
and their desire to be seen
as one with the people.

45:15.887 --> 45:17.279

to be popular,

but to govern.

45:21.980 --> 45:24.504
It'’s not about being popular.

45:24.547 --> 45:26.985
It'’s about allowing
our citizens to be
part of a ceremony

45:27.028 --> 45:29.857

affect their lives.

45:29.901 --> 45:31.685

appreciate that the coronation

traditions we have kept

according to its original
centuries-old design.

45:36.603 --> 45:39.911

because our traditions

into a more civilized past,

as far back
as the Renaissance,
even the Middle Ages.

45:47.962 --> 45:50.225

were civilized.

in inviting the people

what I was saying.

idea of royalty

third-world countries.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.456
So maybe connecting
with the everyday people

would make the monarchy
more relevant?

do not feel obsolete.
