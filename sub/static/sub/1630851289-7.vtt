-Mm.
-What?

00:30.256 --> 00:32.272
It's just we've sold so few
burgers of the day last month.

00:32.441 --> 00:34.366
Well, last month was stupid.
What does it know?

00:34.518 --> 00:36.702
I don't get it. I spend
all this time and energy

00:36.853 --> 00:39.187
picking out fun ingredients
for the burgers of the day.

00:39.356 --> 00:41.707
And last month,
we had some really good ones.

00:41.858 --> 00:43.283
The Stilton of the Night burger.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.786
The... If I Had
a Pumper-nickel Burger.

00:45.938 --> 00:48.605
The Arugulas of Engagement
Burger. I mean, come on.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.457
Yeah, they're all home runs
or grand slams

00:50.609 --> 00:52.200
or whichever one
of those is better.

00:52.294 --> 00:54.035
I guess people just like
what's familiar.

00:54.129 --> 00:55.203
That's why I stick
with the two of you.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.780
Hey, there's some
of my old photos

00:56.949 --> 00:58.282
at the bottom of this box.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.558
How'd they get there?

00:59.709 --> 01:01.042
They're supposed to be in the

01:01.062 --> 01:03.378
"I'm gonna make an amazing
photo album someday" box.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.672
And you're definitely
gonna make that photo album.

01:05.824 --> 01:08.550
(gasps) Look.
This is when I had braces. Ha.

01:08.644 --> 01:09.884
Talk about heavy metal.

01:09.978 --> 01:11.236
Ooh, awkward-phase Mommy.

01:11.388 --> 01:14.055
-Braces in all the right places.
-Aw. Here's a picture

01:14.075 --> 01:16.891
of the fort my dad built
in our backyard.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.244
That looks like a great... fort.

01:19.396 --> 01:21.580
Is this one of those
<i> Back to the Future</i> pictures

01:21.807 --> 01:22.915
where the fort disappeared

01:23.142 --> 01:24.566
because your mom fell in love
with you?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.643
Well, my dad bought the wood,
and he started to build it,

01:26.662 --> 01:28.495
-but he never
actually finished it.
-Why not?

01:28.647 --> 01:31.315
I think the game came on, then
he had to go to the bathroom,

01:31.333 --> 01:33.333
then it was dinnertime,
and then it was winter.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.502
I asked my mom if she could
help me build it, and she said

01:35.654 --> 01:38.171
she and I weren't the kind
of people who build stuff.

01:38.248 --> 01:40.432
That sounds like something awful
your mom would say.

01:40.584 --> 01:43.769
That's not genetic, right?
I built a bear that one time.

01:43.996 --> 01:46.346
Yeah. This might not go in
the amazing photo album drawer.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.682
Maybe that's why
it was in the sad receipt box.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.943
-Sorry, Bob. Great receipts.
-This one's great.

01:51.094 --> 01:53.170
Somebody ordered extra cheese.
50 cents.

01:53.263 --> 01:54.947
That's going
in the college fund.

01:55.098 --> 01:57.991
Which one of us is going
to college? Not it.

02:00.512 --> 02:03.864
Tina, we have to defuse
this bomb before it explodes.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.532
-Because that's what bombs do.
-(slow beeping)

02:05.684 --> 02:07.275
The bomb is too sensitive
for wire cutters.

02:07.369 --> 02:08.852
We'll have to use our lips
to defuse it.

02:08.871 --> 02:10.778
Both of us,
at the same time.

02:10.873 --> 02:12.706
Well, we trained for this.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.115
Yeah, we did. A lot.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.526
-Mmm... Ah, ah.
-Ah. Ah.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.878
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> Tina!</i>

02:17.972 --> 02:19.529
-What?
-It's my turn to use the desk.

02:19.623 --> 02:21.865
So if you could just wrap it up
and wipe all your drool off,

02:21.958 --> 02:23.200
that would be great.

02:23.218 --> 02:24.810
But you already had your turn.
It's my turn.

02:24.961 --> 02:26.536
Look, I'm sorry
we have to share a desk,

02:26.630 --> 02:28.889
and I'm sorry I have a small
room that is actually a closet,

02:29.041 --> 02:30.207
but I need an extra session

02:30.300 --> 02:32.467
because this assignment
is a big deal.

02:32.636 --> 02:35.212
It's Dinosaur Week, Tina.
Dinosaur Week!

02:35.230 --> 02:37.214
I have to write an essay
about my favorite dinosaur,

02:37.232 --> 02:39.216
I have to make a poster,
I have to write a letter

02:39.385 --> 02:41.309
to my favorite dinosaur.
I am swamped.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.495
I remember Dinosaur Week.
I did iguanodon.

02:43.647 --> 02:45.313
My letter
to the dinosaur made Mom cry.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.833
Yes, so, as you know,
if you don't participate

02:48.060 --> 02:50.076
to the fullest extent,
you do not get donuts

02:50.229 --> 02:52.987
at the end of the week, which
they call Dinosaur Donuts,

02:53.007 --> 02:55.007
'cause they're so big, I bet.

02:55.234 --> 02:57.751
No, they're just regular donuts.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.236
Okay, well,
they're still donuts.

02:59.254 --> 03:02.014
So, move.
Spinosaurus is a'calling.

03:02.165 --> 03:03.998
-(grunting)
-I know your room is too small

03:04.018 --> 03:05.742
for a desk, Louise,
but there are

03:05.761 --> 03:07.077
lots of other flat surfaces

03:07.079 --> 03:08.412
in the house
that you could use.

03:08.505 --> 03:11.005
-Then go use one.
-Ugh. Fine.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.083
Spinosaurus?
More like whine-o-saurus.

03:13.101 --> 03:14.509
-What?
-Nothing.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.678
I'd like to see them
try to resist the

03:16.772 --> 03:19.364
I Bean Of Greenie Burger
with black bean parsley puree.

03:19.516 --> 03:22.259
Yeah, only a real sicko
wouldn't order that.

03:22.352 --> 03:24.094
People are probably
gonna want to take a selfie

03:24.263 --> 03:25.779
with that burger
while smelling it.

03:25.931 --> 03:27.539
-A smelfie.
-Thank you, Gene.

03:27.766 --> 03:29.708
-Where's Louise?
-She's upstairs doing homework.

03:29.935 --> 03:31.117
In my room, on my desk.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.069
Louise is doing homework
on a Saturday?

03:33.071 --> 03:34.362
Should I be worried?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.289
It's Dinosaur Week,
which would be fine,

03:36.366 --> 03:38.366
if we weren't a friggin'
one-desk house.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.552
Sorry, sorry. Having three kids
was a great idea.

03:40.779 --> 03:42.446
(gasps)
Wait a second.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.890
I just figured out how we can
put a desk in Louise's room.

03:45.117 --> 03:47.041
All we have to do
is loft her bed.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.952
Lofter is the best medicine.

03:49.045 --> 03:50.787
Yeah, when my cousin Ronnie
lived in New York,

03:50.806 --> 03:51.897
he had this tiny
studio apartment,

03:52.124 --> 03:53.214
and he lofted his bed,

03:53.234 --> 03:55.067
and he put
a little love seat under there.

03:55.218 --> 03:57.069
But, uh, didn't quite
work out for him.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.738
It was more of a like seat.
Poor Ronnie.

03:59.815 --> 04:01.389
Uh... I guess that might work.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.391
Teddy could probably
build something like that

04:03.410 --> 04:06.303
in a way that costs
very little money, hopefully.

04:06.321 --> 04:07.746
I think
that's a great idea, Mom.

04:07.973 --> 04:10.064
And I'm not just saying that
because I've got a bomb squad

04:10.084 --> 04:12.233
that needs
to do tongue-building exercises.

04:12.327 --> 04:14.902
-Hmm.
-I'm gonna go upstairs
and tell Louise the good news.

04:14.997 --> 04:17.314
Right now? Should we ask Teddy
what it will cost first?

04:17.332 --> 04:19.073
Oh, you're already
going up there.

04:19.167 --> 04:20.984
I'll go help Mom
make the sale to Louise.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.669
I'm a good hype man.
Check this out.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.154
What a great idea!

04:24.156 --> 04:25.989
-That'll definitely do it.
-Thanks.

04:26.082 --> 04:28.341
-Hello.
-Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers.
-Hi.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.270
Weird question. I was wondering
if you allowed gaming here?

04:31.421 --> 04:33.330
Well, I play a game called
"Register Surprise,"

04:33.423 --> 04:35.423
Where I hide cold French fries
in the register

04:35.442 --> 04:37.017
for my parents to find.
They love it.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.444
We don't.
Uh, what kind of gaming?

04:39.671 --> 04:41.338
My friends and I play
this role-playing game

04:41.431 --> 04:43.690
called Mages and Monsters,
and we kind of need a place

04:43.784 --> 04:45.525
to do our campaign today
because the garage

04:45.677 --> 04:47.602
we usually use
has a Jeep in it now.

04:47.679 --> 04:49.937
Oh, Mages and Monsters.
I-I think I've heard of that.

04:50.032 --> 04:51.439
You've heard of something?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.033
I thought this would be
a good spot to play

04:53.185 --> 04:54.701
because it's...
not so... busy all the time.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.369
We don't like the hustle bustle.

04:56.522 --> 04:59.113
Well, it's a pretty long game,
so we'll be here for a while,

04:59.207 --> 05:01.041
and I promise we'll order lots
of food and drinks.

05:01.193 --> 05:03.117
I'm the Game Master
so I'm kind of in charge today.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.786
It's my first time, actually.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.621
Sorry. I do that
when I get nervous.

05:06.715 --> 05:08.473
When I go real fast,
it gets hot on my neck.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.976
-I think I see smoke.
-My name's Shirley, by the way.

05:11.203 --> 05:13.870
So, you can call me that.
(laughs) Oh, my God.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.705
I just really want this
to go well.

05:15.724 --> 05:17.983
Say "yes" so she doesn't
drawstring her head off.

05:18.210 --> 05:21.135
-Uh, sure. Why not?
-Oh, thank you so much.

05:21.304 --> 05:23.805
-See you in a couple hours.
-Okay, see you later.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.824
-(door bells tinkle)
-Hey, Dad, check the register.

05:25.975 --> 05:29.143
-There might be a surprise. Hmm?
-Hmm.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.554
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> And your bed's</i>

05:30.572 --> 05:32.072
gonna be going up here
so you can put

05:32.224 --> 05:33.406
a little desk underneath,
and then

05:33.500 --> 05:35.316
you two won't have
to share one anymore, and...

05:35.410 --> 05:38.078
Oh, look at that. I just won
the Smartest Mom Award.

05:38.230 --> 05:41.006
-In your face, other moms.
-What a great idea!

05:41.157 --> 05:43.157
Yes, yes, yes!
I love it.

05:43.251 --> 05:45.251
I'm almost angry at you
for not thinking of it sooner.

05:45.404 --> 05:48.363
I can't believe I slept
like this for so long.

05:48.365 --> 05:51.183
-What a great idea!
-Thank you, Tina, she's in.

05:51.334 --> 05:53.518
Are we doing it today? It gets
built today, I'm strapped in

05:53.745 --> 05:55.912
by tomorrow, I'm eating donuts
by the end of the week.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.081
And I sleep in the clouds
like the gods!

05:58.174 --> 06:01.585
Yeah, today. Why not?
Let's do it. I'll call Teddy.

06:01.603 --> 06:05.530
Sorry, Linda. I'd love to help
you, but, uh, I'm in Canada.

06:05.682 --> 06:08.141
You're in Canada? What the hell
are you doing in Canada?

06:08.293 --> 06:10.184
My mom ordered a scooter
on Canadian eBay,

06:10.204 --> 06:12.019
-and we had to come pick it up.
-(truck horn honking)

06:12.039 --> 06:13.538
We're driving it back down.

06:13.765 --> 06:16.282
She loves that thing,
but she doesn't like to go fast.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.784
What do you want me to do?!

06:17.878 --> 06:19.544
Go around.
Elderly woman scooting.

06:19.771 --> 06:21.046
Linda, I got to go.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.273
Well, Teddy's in Canada.
He won't be able to help us.

06:23.291 --> 06:27.110
No, Teddy! You get on a plane,
and you come home right now!

06:27.112 --> 06:28.945
Yeah, Teddy.
Get your ass back here.

06:28.964 --> 06:30.705
He hung up. He hung up.
Geez.

06:30.799 --> 06:32.224
We were so close.
(sighs)

06:32.451 --> 06:35.452
Okay, you know what? Louise,
you are getting that loft bed.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.138
-Today.
Because we don't need Teddy.
-We don't?

06:38.290 --> 06:39.956
No, we don't.
Because I'm not my mom.

06:40.049 --> 06:42.901
I raise kids that<i> are</i> the kind
of people who build things.

06:43.052 --> 06:44.719
We're loft bed builders.

06:44.796 --> 06:46.071
-Yeah!
-Okay, hands in.

06:46.298 --> 06:47.480
Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

06:47.633 --> 06:49.223
Hands in.
We're gonna build a loft bed

06:49.317 --> 06:50.984
because we are strong,
capable people

06:51.136 --> 06:52.636
who aren't gonna make
the mistakes

06:52.729 --> 06:54.246
their mother-slash-father made

06:54.397 --> 06:56.489
because I'm doing a really
good job parenting, on three.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.141
One, two, three.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.476
LINDA AND LOUISE:
We're gonna build a loft bed...

06:59.569 --> 07:01.144
TINA: We're gonna build
a bed because we're strong

07:01.163 --> 07:02.495
and something
about Grandma and Grandpa,

07:02.648 --> 07:03.813
-and yay.
-(indistinct chatter)

07:03.907 --> 07:05.507
-And three!
-What a great idea.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.987
So, we're building
the loft bed?

07:11.006 --> 07:13.006
No, we're building a loft bed.

07:13.158 --> 07:14.007
You have to work
in the restaurant.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.416
It's funny. I was thinking

07:15.436 --> 07:17.827
that you also have
to work in the restaurant.

07:17.846 --> 07:18.937
Well, Gene can help you.

07:19.164 --> 07:20.755
(chanting):
I'm a little juice box.

07:20.849 --> 07:21.848
This is where the straw goes.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.424
Hmm. I-I have a crazy idea.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.610
we wait 'till next weekend.
Teddy builds the loft bed.

07:25.837 --> 07:27.779
And this weekend,
we all work in the restaurant

07:27.931 --> 07:29.506
so we can pay our rent.

07:29.524 --> 07:30.598
Ugh. You and your rent.

07:30.692 --> 07:33.100
I-I'm... I'm sorry
to be so hung up on it.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.678
Dad, it is Dinosaur Week.

07:34.771 --> 07:37.363
Do not get between me
and those donuts, old man.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.349
She's been sleeping
near the floor like an idiot.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.609
We need to get this kid lofted
and out of my room.

07:41.778 --> 07:43.036
But Louise,
don't you need to work

07:43.188 --> 07:45.130
on your dinosaur project,
like, today?

07:45.357 --> 07:48.041
Hey, this is my new loft bed
we're talking about.

07:48.117 --> 07:49.542
I'll work twice as hard tomorrow

07:49.636 --> 07:51.452
if I can sleep twice
as high tonight.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.954
-What?
-Bob, this is important.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.789
It's something
I'm teaching our girls.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.033
Okay, yes, I get it.
We'll be fine.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.035
Uh-oh. Where'd the straw go?
Is it inside me?

07:59.128 --> 08:01.313
I hate it when it gets lost
in the juice box!

08:01.540 --> 08:02.814
Oh, there it is.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.208
I can't believe how many videos
there were on the Internet

08:05.227 --> 08:06.559
about how to build loft beds.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.394
They'll teach you anything,
those Internets.

08:08.471 --> 08:10.380
Do you think anyone
ever built a loft bed

08:10.473 --> 08:11.881
and didn't made a video
about it?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.883
I just hope
Kim and Sons Hardware

08:13.977 --> 08:15.309
has a fireworks control panel.

08:15.387 --> 08:17.311
(laughs)
I assume they do.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.556
And some reasonable
water slide options.

08:19.649 --> 08:21.166
It's gonna be amazing.

08:26.656 --> 08:29.216
(alarm blares)

08:35.999 --> 08:37.349
So you have no retinal scanners?

08:37.500 --> 08:40.668
I mean, did you look? Do you
want to check in the back?

08:40.762 --> 08:41.911
We do not have them.

08:42.005 --> 08:43.671
Do these blueprints
mean nothing?

08:43.690 --> 08:44.856
I worked really hard on them

08:45.083 --> 08:46.382
in the five minutes
it took to drive here.

08:46.434 --> 08:49.269
Louise, it's okay.
We'll do the basics this week,

08:49.363 --> 08:51.012
and we can always add to it.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.364
I'll help you
put up the barbed wire

08:52.591 --> 08:53.940
if we figure out
where to get some.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.108
Don't patronize me.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.368
BOB:
Hey, guys, uh,

08:56.519 --> 08:58.094
not sure if you've had a chance

08:58.187 --> 08:59.946
to look at the board over there,
but our burger of the day

09:00.098 --> 09:02.374
is the I Bean of Greenie Burger.

09:02.525 --> 09:04.434
It's really good.
Everyone says so.

09:04.603 --> 09:06.027
Gene, can get you started
on drinks,

09:06.046 --> 09:07.712
and we'll take your order
when you're ready.

09:07.939 --> 09:10.123
-What are we thinking?
Mai tais?
-We don't have those.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.941
I'll have a cheeseburger
and fries.

09:12.035 --> 09:13.276
-Me, too.
-Same for me, but no cheese.

09:13.369 --> 09:15.945
Oh, okay, everyone's ordering
really quickly.

09:15.964 --> 09:16.963
I-I feel like
you didn't really

09:17.115 --> 09:18.706
let the burger of the day
sink in.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.284
I-I can give you some time.
There's-there's no rush.

09:21.303 --> 09:23.136
I'd love
to try the burger of the day.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.063
Oh. That is...
There you go. Good.

09:25.214 --> 09:27.566
Uh, Shirley's gonna try
the burger of the day.

09:27.717 --> 09:29.050
Uh, any-anybody else?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.661
No, just regular stupid burgers?
I'm just kidding.

09:31.721 --> 09:34.447
-They're not stupid.
They're gonna be good.
-Attaboy.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.223
(both grunt)

09:36.318 --> 09:38.802
And... loft.
Ah, didn't work.

09:38.895 --> 09:40.561
-I got the drill.
-We have a drill?

09:40.581 --> 09:44.065
Yeah. Phyllis Driller. She's
old, but she's still working.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.643
-It has a burning smell.
-Is it powered by coal?

09:46.812 --> 09:47.977
Look, we have a saw, too.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.087
-I call the drill.
-Oh, uh...

09:49.238 --> 09:51.147
-Let's get loftin'!
-Yeah!

09:51.166 --> 09:52.982
-Okay. Oh, boy. Should we maybe
-(whirring)

09:53.001 --> 09:55.001
discuss safety?
Aah!

09:55.153 --> 09:57.053
♪<i> Building a loft</i> ♪

10:09.592 --> 10:11.926
You notice a chest
in the corner.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.337
The lid is carved
with goblin hieroglyphs.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.097
Sounds like something from Etsy.

10:16.191 --> 10:18.933
Do you attempt to open it?
I'll let you discuss.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.193
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be good.

10:20.345 --> 10:22.011
Don't run away.
It's fine. It's all fine.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.363
Wait, are you gonna run away?

10:23.531 --> 10:25.940
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't think so. I'm fine.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.126
I'm just a little nervous.
I'm trying something new.

10:28.353 --> 10:30.962
I wanted to do something
exciting and a little different,

10:31.189 --> 10:32.613
but they might not like it.

10:32.707 --> 10:35.616
Exciting and a little different
is what I call my "hmm-hmm."

10:35.636 --> 10:37.302
-BOB. Hmm.
-But maybe it's not worth it.

10:37.453 --> 10:38.619
Maybe I should just bail

10:38.639 --> 10:40.454
on my whole goblin idea
and play it safe.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.807
I don't know exactly
what you're talking about,

10:43.034 --> 10:45.310
but I would maybe try
the exciting thing?

10:45.461 --> 10:47.461
(sighs heavily)
Okay, okay. I'm doing it.

10:47.555 --> 10:50.815
Uh, hey, does anyone else want
to try the burger of the day?

10:50.967 --> 10:53.134
Since you all seem
to keep being here.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.469
Uh, fries. For the whole table.
Keep 'em coming.

10:55.563 --> 10:58.639
-We're gonna attempt
to open the chest.
-(sighs)

10:58.659 --> 10:59.899
Okay. The lid opens,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.309
but a blinding green light
comes out of it.

11:02.404 --> 11:06.313
This, my friends,
is the Curse of the Goblin King.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.573
Huh?

11:07.668 --> 11:08.983
What a twist.
I think.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.577
And here are your new
character sheets.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.230
You all love this.
I can tell by your faces.

11:14.249 --> 11:15.581
What's happening?

11:15.734 --> 11:17.658
Okay, um, now, uh,

11:17.752 --> 11:19.068
as the mist clears, you see

11:19.087 --> 11:21.680
that you've been turned
into... goblins.

11:21.756 --> 11:23.072
-Yay!
-Ugh.

11:23.241 --> 11:25.350
I'm a short, male goblin
named Grumley?

11:25.501 --> 11:27.334
-I have goblin syphilis?
-Uh-huh.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.245
(quietly): She was right.
They don't like it.

11:29.338 --> 11:30.930
Maybe I'll tell them
they're all Shreks now.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.749
Shake things up even more.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.083
<i> (drill whirring)</i>

11:34.102 --> 11:35.601
Well, I don't know what that is,

11:35.696 --> 11:37.937
but it's starting to look
like something I can sleep on.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.089
Mom, I got to say,
you might not seem like you know

11:40.108 --> 11:42.033
-what you're doing,
but you know what you're doing.
-LINDA: Yeah.

11:42.185 --> 11:43.927
I do.
Me and that nice lady

11:43.945 --> 11:45.519
who made the video
with the awful music.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.280
Check us out.
We're getting there.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.948
Just most of it left to go.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.858
Should we take a break?
Just process everything

11:50.952 --> 11:52.693
that we've done,
maybe journal about it?

11:52.787 --> 11:53.953
No, sweetie, we're on a roll.

11:54.105 --> 11:55.605
We got to finish this sucker.

11:55.623 --> 11:57.941
Yeah, Tina.
You don't sleep until I sleep.

11:58.034 --> 12:00.034
-Up there.
-That's the spirit.

12:00.128 --> 12:02.779
We're strong, we're capable,
get used to it.

12:02.797 --> 12:04.781
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ow. Ow!

12:04.783 --> 12:05.873
-Are you okay?
-Were you trying

12:05.967 --> 12:06.891
to break that board
with your elbow?

12:07.043 --> 12:09.376
Aah! Oh!
Everything's fine.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.304
Okay, let's do this.
Ow!

12:11.456 --> 12:12.731
Oh.
Oh, broke my arm.

12:12.958 --> 12:14.307
No, I didn't.
Ow. Yes, I did.

12:14.459 --> 12:16.793
Oh, it hurts. Oh, it hurts.
We're fine. Ow. Ow.

12:16.811 --> 12:19.028
-See? She's fine?
-Ow.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.300
Mom, I feel like
you really hurt your elbow.

12:24.319 --> 12:25.985
What?
Just because it's throbbing

12:26.137 --> 12:28.062
and I'm crying a little bit
and I want to cut it off?

12:28.156 --> 12:29.247
Well, we're not giving up.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.990
You two girls have
all your arm parts.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.809
I can just tell you what to do.

12:32.827 --> 12:34.068
Shouldn't we stop
and let Dad know

12:34.087 --> 12:35.587
you maybe broke your elbow?

12:35.814 --> 12:36.904
And then take you to a doctor?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.481
No. I don't need an elbow
or a doctor.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.573
We're doing this.

12:39.651 --> 12:41.667
Yeah, Tina,
if Mama says she's okay,

12:41.820 --> 12:42.910
then Mama's okay, okay?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.320
We're talking about my loft bed.

12:44.339 --> 12:46.598
Dreams.
We're building dreams here!

12:46.674 --> 12:50.059
-Yeah! Ow.
-Uh...

12:53.181 --> 12:55.256
This is a really long game.
Longer than Monopoly.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.091
And you don't even get
to dabble in real estate

12:57.185 --> 12:58.926
or visit your sister in jail.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.445
Yeah, it's almost time to close.

13:00.672 --> 13:02.263
But I don't want
to just ask them to leave.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.282
Because you feel really guilty
about telling Shirley

13:04.433 --> 13:06.951
to do the exciting new thing
and now everybody hates her?

13:07.028 --> 13:10.029
(sighs) Kind of, yes.
But, I mean, we have to close.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.773
Why don't you start
casually sweeping up?

13:12.867 --> 13:14.534
You know me.
I always sweep it casual.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.686
Yay. This is so much more fun
than playing as the character

13:16.688 --> 13:19.113
-I spent six years building up.
-(laughs)

13:19.132 --> 13:20.356
(singsongy):
Sweep, sweep, sweeping.

13:20.449 --> 13:22.283
Something we do
at the end of the day.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.968
You know what?
I'll be right back.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.638
I just need to get, uh,
some more, uh, napkins.

13:26.865 --> 13:29.140
Oh, they hate it. Uh,
they hate it very, very much.

13:29.292 --> 13:30.141
No.

13:30.293 --> 13:32.201
They don't seem
too mad about it.

13:32.295 --> 13:35.313
Maybe they sigh and roll their
eyes when they like things?

13:35.390 --> 13:37.148
I just... I thought,
having to fight your way back

13:37.300 --> 13:39.225
to your character
would be more satisfying

13:39.377 --> 13:40.726
than just the same old
same old.

13:40.895 --> 13:43.046
But I'm an idiot.
No one likes it.

13:43.064 --> 13:45.139
Well, the good news
is we have to close,

13:45.158 --> 13:47.400
so it'll be over soon,
at least?

13:47.552 --> 13:49.661
No! You can't close now.
If we end it like this,

13:49.812 --> 13:51.721
they'll never trust me
to be Game Master again.

13:51.739 --> 13:54.148
You could find another hobby.
I like fake sweeping.

13:54.242 --> 13:56.317
Please, please stay open
a little longer.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.244
-I just need a bit more time.
-(sighs)

13:58.396 --> 14:00.580
I guess we can stay open
for a little bit longer.

14:00.732 --> 14:01.840
Thank you!

14:02.067 --> 14:04.083
Okay, I spent
an appropriate amount of time

14:04.252 --> 14:05.902
getting these napkins for us.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.420
Also, Bob said
he can stay open longer

14:07.496 --> 14:10.073
-so we can keep the game going.
-Great.
-Yay.

14:10.166 --> 14:13.076
Good luck,
and maybe finish soon.

14:13.094 --> 14:15.078
And enjoy the napkins.

14:15.171 --> 14:16.354
You got
to hold it straight, honey.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.097
The drill's got to be straight.
And Tina,

14:18.249 --> 14:19.932
-stop wincing.
-Here comes the spinning

14:20.026 --> 14:22.110
-rod of death!
-(moans)

14:23.271 --> 14:25.421
You moved.
You have to hold it in place.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.257
-I'm scared of the spinning
rod of death.
-Why?!

14:28.351 --> 14:30.610
Okay. All right, why don't you
switch? Tina, take the drill.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.036
Louise, hold the board.
Come on.

14:32.188 --> 14:34.947
-Ugh. I'll never
forgive you for this.
-Okay.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.266
-Uh, ready?
-(drill whirring)

14:37.360 --> 14:38.784
Uh, uh, no, no, no, no, no!
This is not gonna work.

14:38.937 --> 14:40.044
You have to open your eyes.

14:40.271 --> 14:41.954
Well, I don't want to see
if I maim you.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.548
-I think you should have to see.
-(phone ringing)

14:43.699 --> 14:46.384
-Hold on, hold on.
Don't drill. Don't drill.
-Oh, thank God.

14:46.461 --> 14:50.037
-Hello? Ow.
-Hey, Lin.
Why-Why'd you say "Ow"?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.448
It's a long story.
How you doing? You coming up?

14:52.541 --> 14:55.709
(sighs) No. We're gonna be
staying open a little later,

14:55.729 --> 14:58.304
so I-I can't come up there
and help with the loft.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.214
Not that I'd be very helpful

15:00.233 --> 15:02.808
because of me not knowing
how to do that.

15:02.961 --> 15:05.478
Well, don't worry about us.
I don't have a broken arm.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.905
The loft's going good.

15:07.132 --> 15:08.406
Did-did you just say
you don't have a broken arm?

15:08.633 --> 15:10.983
Yeah, it hurts a lot,
and I can't move it at all,

15:11.060 --> 15:12.485
but we're fine. We're fine.

15:12.637 --> 15:15.154
Oh, God. Lin, you don't have
to finish the bed, like, now.

15:15.323 --> 15:16.973
You-you could wait
for Teddy to come back.

15:16.991 --> 15:19.992
No. We're gonna get this thing
done tonight, no matter what.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.495
I love you. Have fun down there,
make some good burgers.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.738
I will. I mean, they're not
really ordering burgers,

15:24.758 --> 15:25.998
but...
O-Oh, you're gone.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.092
The scroll tells of an amulet

15:28.244 --> 15:30.744
with the powers
to undo dark magic.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.263
Great.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.990
Gene, you have to go to bed.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.008
No. I'm not gonna leave you.
What if you turn into a goblin?

15:36.161 --> 15:37.936
Then who's gonna
walk me down the aisle?

15:38.087 --> 15:40.104
Why don't you just
go lay down in the booth?

15:40.181 --> 15:42.256
And close your eyes
and just listen?

15:42.333 --> 15:44.758
Ooh, like a podcast
about annoyed people.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.593
(yawns, snores)

15:46.688 --> 15:47.928
Okay, okay, stop!

15:47.948 --> 15:49.188
-It's in. It's in!
-What?!

15:49.340 --> 15:50.949
Stop!
You're stripping the screw!

15:51.100 --> 15:52.933
Stripping the screw
in a good way?

15:53.011 --> 15:54.285
Is it even holding
any wood together?

15:54.512 --> 15:56.846
I don't know,
but it... looks nice.

15:56.864 --> 15:58.289
Oh. It's crazy late,

15:58.441 --> 16:00.441
and there's more wood in the
pile than there is on the bed.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.351
We're not gonna be able
to finish this tonight.

16:02.370 --> 16:05.871
-Or maybe ever.
-What? No, the night is young.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.040
Come on. You two can cuddle
with me in my bed.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.376
Bob and Gene have left us.
It's just us now.

16:10.494 --> 16:12.545
-Can I sleep with the drill?
-Maybe no drill?

16:12.697 --> 16:14.030
Fine. Saw.

16:14.048 --> 16:15.473
(yawns)
I didn't think

16:15.700 --> 16:17.475
I was gonna be sleeping
at sea level tonight.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.869
Eh, I just wanted
to give you the confidence

16:19.962 --> 16:21.980
that you could do stuff
that my mom never gave me.

16:22.207 --> 16:24.557
But I failed,
and now I only have one arm.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.043
And it's not even
my favorite arm. (moans)

16:27.061 --> 16:29.395
At least you still have
your second-favorite?

16:29.547 --> 16:32.231
No, I failed.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.640
(crying)

16:33.660 --> 16:37.720
(snoring, crying)

16:37.813 --> 16:40.056
-Wow. A cry-snore.
-(groans)

16:40.149 --> 16:41.741
Ugh. That sound's gonna
haunt my dreams.

16:41.817 --> 16:43.817
(Tina snores, moans)

16:43.895 --> 16:45.545
Oof, that sound, too.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.584
Unsheathe my sword
and demand he let us pass.

outside world is still there.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.951
I'm really losing it.

17:26.104 --> 17:27.211
Gene, why don't you go upstairs
and go back to sleep?

17:27.363 --> 17:28.938
I'm too invested.
I want to find out

17:29.107 --> 17:31.107
what happens
to these twentysomethings.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.109
Time's running out.
You have to make a choice now.

17:33.202 --> 17:35.386
The chamber will fill
with water at any moment.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.221
Come on, people.
Use what you have.

17:37.373 --> 17:39.706
What if we stand
on each other's shoulders?

17:39.726 --> 17:40.950
Yes!
I mean, yes.

17:41.043 --> 17:42.376
Yeah, and then
we can reach the amulet.

17:42.395 --> 17:46.022
Mm-hmm. Roll D20.
You need a 14 or higher.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.975
-16!
-Oh, like the candles.

17:50.128 --> 17:51.235
You take possession
of the amulet.

17:51.462 --> 17:53.813
And you are transformed
back into...

17:53.965 --> 17:55.740
your original characters!

17:55.967 --> 17:58.651
Congratulations.
Good job, players.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.136
And me, also.
Your Game Master.

18:00.229 --> 18:03.155
Oh, thank God. Um, hey,
I have your check ready.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.975
So, next time can we just play
the game the regular the way?

18:06.068 --> 18:07.901
That made us all happy
to begin with?

18:07.995 --> 18:09.587
(sighs)
Yeah, sure.

18:09.814 --> 18:11.163
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.983
Uh, I've been watching
you guys play this game

18:14.118 --> 18:16.652
for so, so many hours.

18:16.745 --> 18:17.929
And you all got into it.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.080
Y-You all had intense,
game-playing faces

18:20.100 --> 18:21.915
for, like, the last three hours.
And-and look--

18:22.009 --> 18:23.326
look at how chewed
these straws are.

18:23.419 --> 18:24.827
No one chews a straw that much

18:24.846 --> 18:26.253
unless they're really
concentrating.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.606
And yeah, Shirley
made a different choice,

18:28.757 --> 18:30.516
and it wasn't
what you guys were used to,

18:30.668 --> 18:32.501
but I think you were
actually into it.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.947
Yeah, you were. You guys barely
peed at all. That we know of.

18:36.098 --> 18:38.007
Look, I-I make
a burger of the day.

18:38.025 --> 18:39.951
Only Shirley ordered it,
unfortunately.

18:40.102 --> 18:42.011
It-It's different
than the usual burger.

18:42.029 --> 18:44.013
But I make a new one every day,

18:44.031 --> 18:45.957
even if people don't always
think they want it.

18:46.184 --> 18:48.126
Because
it keeps things interesting.

18:48.277 --> 18:50.128
Like what Shirley was
trying to do with the game.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.463
Well, it did
make things tougher.

18:52.615 --> 18:54.707
We really had to think
on our toes.

18:54.859 --> 18:56.283
Your little goblin toes.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.877
I guess, it did kind of make me
feel the way I did

18:58.029 --> 18:59.161
when I first started playing.

18:59.163 --> 19:01.121
-Nervous. Like, in a good way.
-Really?

19:01.141 --> 19:03.215
Yeah. So, well done,
Game Master.

19:03.368 --> 19:05.810
Thanks. No big deal.
I'm playing it cool. (chuckles)

19:06.037 --> 19:07.052
So, that's great.

19:07.372 --> 19:09.981
You guys should probably
pay me money and then go.

19:10.132 --> 19:12.208
I'm actually kind of hungry.

19:12.226 --> 19:13.967
I would try
the I Bean of Greenie Burger.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.487
-I'll try one, too.
-Really? I-I was gonna go

19:16.639 --> 19:18.214
to sleep for a couple hours
before we open again,

19:18.383 --> 19:19.991
but sure, I'll make you guys
burgers of the day.

19:20.142 --> 19:22.643
Or-or burgers of the yesterday,
actually.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.403
(laughs)
God, I need sleep.

19:24.555 --> 19:26.906
I would like a western omelet
with fresh fruit.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.892
-And maybe a side of linguica?
-No.

19:30.061 --> 19:31.652
(rapid tapping)

19:31.746 --> 19:33.171
What? What's that?

19:34.081 --> 19:37.157
Oh, my God.
Girls, what's going on in here?

19:37.177 --> 19:39.677
I couldn't sleep
and Tina couldn't, either,

19:39.828 --> 19:42.922
'cause I woke her up, and then,
we couldn't build the whole bed

19:43.016 --> 19:45.332
'cause we ran
into some issues with our height

19:45.426 --> 19:47.518
and not being able
to lift heavy things

19:47.745 --> 19:49.169
like adult people can.

19:49.247 --> 19:51.022
But we did add
these almost full-sized legs

19:51.173 --> 19:53.840
to the bed frame,
which are almost all even.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.602
Yeah, and here's a nail where
I can hang my throwing stars.

19:56.754 --> 19:59.179
And if you really squeeze it
in there, you could fit a desk.

19:59.348 --> 20:01.106
Like, a laying-down desk?

20:01.201 --> 20:04.443
Wow! You stayed up to do this?
All by yourselves?

20:04.595 --> 20:07.596
I'm so proud of my two
strong babies, my builders.

20:07.615 --> 20:10.282
-(cries)
-TINA: Don't cry, Mom.
You're gonna make me cry.

20:10.435 --> 20:13.118
Actually, I think
I'm just so, so tired.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.379
Okay, I'm climbing up.
Somebody give me a boost.

20:15.606 --> 20:18.107
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Hold on. Hold on.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.608
Let's maybe check
your measurements again

20:19.660 --> 20:21.777
after you get some sleep.
At ground level.

20:21.870 --> 20:25.097
You're builders. You know how
it is. It's part of the process.

20:25.207 --> 20:27.116
(yawns) Ooh, I got to do
my dinosaur report.

20:27.118 --> 20:29.876
-Should we get started
on the desk?
-Okay.

20:29.971 --> 20:31.287
Take a break, take a break.

20:31.305 --> 20:33.231
You're amazing, but let's
get you some breakfast.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.399
Then you can go to sleep and
maybe do your homework after.

20:35.551 --> 20:38.143
And then we can get Teddy
to finish everything up for us.

20:38.296 --> 20:39.904
I don't sleep anymore.
Don't need it.

20:40.055 --> 20:42.055
I make stuff and then
I do dinosaur stuff.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.799
But I might lie down
on the rug real quick.

20:43.818 --> 20:46.635
(yawns) Oh, yeah, the floor
does look kind of comfy.

20:46.637 --> 20:49.638
Let me just... Mm. Yup.
Sawdust makes it softer.

20:49.699 --> 20:50.897
Aw, my little handy hamsters.

20:51.066 --> 20:53.158
Hmm. What food
can I make with one arm?

20:53.311 --> 20:55.569
Ooh, toast! See, other arm?
I don't need you.
