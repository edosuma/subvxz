of morale.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.812
A lot of people onboard
are going to have doubts.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.899
Eli , you were flying
a Kino in everyone's
face last night.

12:56.359 --> 13:01.363
J ust until the poker game,
then . . . Then l put it
in search mode.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.407
Well , maybe it
caught something .

13:03.491 --> 13:04.825
Something that
might indicate that

13:04.909 --> 13:07.661
Colonel Young had
nothing do with this.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.415
Or that he did .

13:11.916 --> 13:12.958
(SCOFFS)

13:13.042 --> 13:14.877
l find that hard to believe.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.505
Have you contacted
Earth yet?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.426
l was just about to use
the communication stones.

13:22.719 --> 13:28.932
Well , whatever
your superiors advise,
we are on our own out here.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.019
Best we handle
this ourselves.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.784
Thanks for coming .

13:52.749 --> 13:56.418
l need a favor. Obviously,
you've heard about
what's been going on .

13:56.503 --> 13:58.295
lt's pretty hard to miss.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.172
l didn't do it.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.259
Okay.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.721
U nfortunately, it looks
like l'm going to have
to clear my name

14:07.805 --> 14:09.848
before l can
find out who did .

14:09.933 --> 14:11.225
l don't understand .

14:11.309 --> 14:15.479
Wray used the stones. . .
Please. . . To talk
to her lOA superiors.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.813
She came back
authorized to hold

14:16.940 --> 14:19.191
an evidentiary
hearing on the matter.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.400
That doesn't sound so bad .

14:20.485 --> 14:22.945
Don't kid yourself.
She's going to come after me.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.112
Why?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.322
Well , the lOA's been
chomping at the bit

14:25.406 --> 14:26.990
to have one of
their own in charge.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.201
This is the best
shot they've got.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.411
Well , you could talk
to General O'Neill .

14:31.496 --> 14:32.955
Miss Armstrong ,
l could stay in charge

14:33.039 --> 14:34.289
without having to
run to General O'Neill

14:34.374 --> 14:35.916
if that's what
l wanted to do.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.918
This is about more than that.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.964
The point is,
if she's going to be
the de facto prosecutor,

14:42.048 --> 14:43.882
l'm going to need a defense.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.926
So. . .

14:47.178 --> 14:48.929
Me?
You went to Harvard .

14:49.305 --> 14:50.389
Political Science.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.182
This is more
politics than law.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.935
l would think
Lieutenant Scott, or. . .

14:55.019 --> 14:58.772
l don't want it to seem
like the military
against the civilians.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.734
Please.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.531
Doctor, have
you ever seen

15:07.615 --> 15:10.325
Colonel Young attack
one of his own men before?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.411
l wouldn't call it
an attack.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.208
He was defending me.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.877
Have you ever
seen Colonel Young

15:20.962 --> 15:23.255
have any kind of
physical confrontation

15:23.339 --> 15:25.048
with one of his men?
No.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.676
But l'm not military.

15:28.177 --> 15:32.931
WRAY: You did serve
at lcarus Base for
a period of six months,

15:33.266 --> 15:34.850
which was under his command .

15:34.934 --> 15:38.437
Look, Spencer was
out of control .
He had to do something .

15:38.980 --> 15:39.980
Did he?

15:40.732 --> 15:43.191
VOLKER: l was in the Control
Room running a test.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.653
Colonel Young
and Dr. Rush were. . .
Were talking .

15:46.738 --> 15:49.239
l don't think they realized
that l could hear them .

15:49.324 --> 15:51.033
WRAY: And what were
they saying?

15:51.659 --> 15:54.911
Colonel Young was complaining
about Sergeant Spencer.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.331
Said that he had
gotten out of hand ,

15:57.415 --> 16:00.125
and if the situation
didn't improve,

16:00.209 --> 16:02.961
he might have to
take drastic measures.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.006
But you have no way
of knowing what he
meant by that, do you?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.841
Assuming you heard correctly.

16:07.925 --> 16:08.967
No, not at the time,
l didn't.

16:09.052 --> 16:12.179
l don't remember
the exact details
of the conversation .

16:12.263 --> 16:13.847
WRAY: But you do
remember speaking with

16:13.931 --> 16:16.099
Colonel Young
about Sergeant Spencer?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.479
Well , the Colonel was doing
most of the talking .

16:20.563 --> 16:22.272
l think he just
wanted to let off steam .

16:22.357 --> 16:25.817
Do you remember him
saying that if things
didn't improve,

16:25.902 --> 16:28.362
he was going to have to
take drastic action?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.822
l'm not sure he
used those exact words.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.995
Do you agree that
Sergeant Spencer
was a disruptive force,

16:37.080 --> 16:41.583
that his attitude
was damaging to morale
and was only getting worse?

16:42.752 --> 16:43.752
Yes.

16:44.420 --> 16:49.216
Then would you say
that his removal
from the situation

16:49.300 --> 16:53.178
has been a net
benefit or a detriment?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.722
l know what
you're trying to do.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.434
You want me to suggest that
we're better off without him ,

17:00.645 --> 17:02.187
and therefore imply
that Colonel Young

17:02.271 --> 17:04.564
may have drawn
the same conclusion .

17:04.648 --> 17:08.359
That as commander
he may have believed
he had no choice.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.321
Well?

17:12.406 --> 17:15.282
Well , that would
be pure speculation ,
and l'm having none of it.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.288
Didn't stop him from
saying it out loud ,
did it?

17:21.207 --> 17:22.790
Are you sure
there's nothing in
the Kino footage?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.377
l've confirmed alibis for
half a dozen or so people,

17:26.462 --> 17:28.463
but l haven't
found anything that
helps the Colonel .

17:31.008 --> 17:33.051
You found an empty
bottle of sleeping pills

17:33.136 --> 17:35.053
in Sergeant Spencer's
quarters, didn't you?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.263
Yes.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.889
Did you know he
was taking them?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.728
l wish l had .
l might have been
able to help him .

17:43.771 --> 17:47.315
You're suggesting that
he had a dependence,
and as a result,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.693
that he was
suffering from withdrawal?

17:49.986 --> 17:51.570
lt would explain
a lot of things.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.822
But you don't
know that for a fact.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.866
No.
CH LOE: Hypothetically,

17:55.950 --> 17:57.451
if he was suffering
from withdrawal ,

17:57.535 --> 17:59.953
it could have
caused him anxiety,

18:00.037 --> 18:02.831
depression ,
even suicidal tendencies.
Yes.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.167
ln fact,
all the physical evidence. . .

18:05.251 --> 18:07.502
The blood spatter,
the angle of the wound ,

18:07.670 --> 18:11.256
the position of the body,
it was all consistent
with suicide.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.550
Yes.
But you're not
a forensic scientist.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.720
No, but l've seen
gunshot suicides before.

18:16.804 --> 18:21.475
And in those cases
was the gun ever absent
when the body was found?

18:21.559 --> 18:23.435
No, but it's obvious that
someone planted . . .

18:23.519 --> 18:24.519
lt's not up to
you to speculate. . .

18:24.604 --> 18:27.272
lsn't it true, Lieutenant,
that if we were on Earth ,

18:27.356 --> 18:28.648
there is a simple
test you could do

18:28.733 --> 18:31.485
to determine if
Sergeant Spencer
had fired that gun?

18:31.569 --> 18:34.905
l suppose we
could test his hand
for powder residue,

18:34.989 --> 18:37.866
and properly test the weapon
for fingerprints,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.409
but we don't have
the necessary
equipment onboard .

18:39.494 --> 18:42.204
ls it possible
that a forensic
scientist from Earth ,

18:45.541 --> 18:47.667
even without
the special equipment
you're talking about?

18:47.752 --> 18:49.920
Ms. Wray. . .
lf we hadn't
handled the weapon

18:50.004 --> 18:51.463
or contaminated
the crime scene. . .

18:51.547 --> 18:53.173
Yeah , but whose
decision was it

18:53.257 --> 18:54.925
to have us
investigate this ourselves?

18:55.051 --> 18:57.928
Ms. Wray, l think
it was my turn
to ask questions.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.721
What are you doing?

19:00.223 --> 19:02.349
l'm taking my turn ,
as we agreed .

19:04.477 --> 19:09.856
Lieutenant,
would a proper autopsy
be able to determine

19:09.941 --> 19:12.651
if he was in fact
suffering from withdrawal?

19:12.735 --> 19:14.778
Yes.
CH LOE: Expert or no expert,

19:15.738 --> 19:19.074
without any actual forensic
equipment or facilities,

19:19.158 --> 19:22.285
is it possible to
know for certain
what really happened?

19:24.747 --> 19:26.122
l don't think so.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.210
l think it's time
that we take a short recess.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.421
We'll resume in an hour.
Thank you .

19:33.506 --> 19:34.923
(PEOPLE CHATTl NG)

19:39.804 --> 19:41.930
l need to talk to you , now.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.312
What was that?
We're trying to get
to the truth here.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.522
l don't think
that's even possible.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.358
We can't afford to have
an unsolved murder hanging
over our heads.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.026
So forget about
the possibility

19:55.111 --> 19:56.611
that the Colonel
is being framed

19:56.696 --> 19:57.696
and just get this
over with?

19:57.780 --> 20:00.198
l don't think
Colonel Young is
so far above reproach

20:00.283 --> 20:01.700
as you seem to think he is.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.035
Oh , well , you're the
H uman Resources person .

20:04.120 --> 20:05.662
You would know
all about that.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.372
ln fact, you probably
know more about

20:07.456 --> 20:08.999
every person
on this ship than anyone.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.502
lf we're throwing
due process out the window,
who do you think did it?

20:12.587 --> 20:14.296
We'll just go with that.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.757
PARK: You don't think
he really did it.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.551
FlSH ER: l'm not so sure
what to think anymore.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.720
VOLKER: Spencer was a menace,
though , we all know it.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.179
l mean , maybe it's
just like Rush said ,

20:23.264 --> 20:25.682
maybe he thought he
had no other choice.

20:25.766 --> 20:26.766
PARK: No, that's crazy.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.603
CAl N E: Well , let's face it,
how well do any of us
really know the man?

20:29.687 --> 20:33.315
She wants to gather
all the evidence she can ,
and then put it to a vote.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.441
What, like a jury?

20:34.525 --> 20:35.817
CH LOE: No, everyone.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.362
l say we end this right now.

20:40.656 --> 20:44.075
l say we go in there,
tell them that
the party's over,

20:44.160 --> 20:46.995
and get back to work!
Who's with me?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.583
All right,
take it easy, Greer.

20:52.001 --> 20:52.959
This is mob rule.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.794
Sergeant. . .
Lieutenant.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.380
This is what they
used to do to
guys like me

20:57.465 --> 20:59.799
for looking at white women
the wrong way.

20:59.884 --> 21:03.011
Now, you think l'm
going to hang back
and let this go?

21:05.723 --> 21:07.265
Am l interrupting something?

21:07.350 --> 21:08.516
No, sir.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.435
At ease.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.481
This has gone on
long enough , Colonel .

21:14.565 --> 21:16.107
We're ready to
back your play.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.276
That won't be necessary.
Sir?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.779
Ms. Wray and l have already
come to an agreement.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.614
She's going to
close the investigation

21:22.698 --> 21:24.449
for lack of
evidence against me.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.868
l , in return ,
will be stepping down .

21:26.953 --> 21:29.329
From this moment on ,
she is in command .

21:42.969 --> 21:45.178
l hear congratulations
are in order.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.891
Really? l was just wondering
what l've gotten myself into.

21:50.393 --> 21:53.228
RUSH : An opportunity
to do things differently,
perhaps?

21:53.437 --> 21:55.230
What do you want, N icholas?

21:55.690 --> 21:58.274
Control over my science team ,
including Eli .

21:58.859 --> 22:00.360
But you report to me.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.153
Of course.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.072
That's it?

22:04.740 --> 22:06.241
You sound surprised .

22:18.963 --> 22:20.171
This is it?

22:20.256 --> 22:21.256
This is it.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.340
Not very impressive.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.342
l mean , as far as chairs go.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.428
Well , time will tell ,
l suppose.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.972
So you sit in the chair,

22:29.056 --> 22:32.142
and it downloads
the secrets of the
universe into your head?

22:32.226 --> 22:33.184
And then you die.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.061
Not necessarily, Eli .

22:35.187 --> 22:38.189
Every time it's
ever been tried ,
this close to death .

22:38.274 --> 22:39.441
FRAN KLl N : Who's tried it?

22:39.525 --> 22:40.608
RUSH : General O'Neill ,
for one.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.569
And he survived .
We don't have
little gray aliens

22:42.695 --> 22:44.404
to set things
right this time.
RUSH : No, we don't,

22:44.488 --> 22:47.991
but this is
an earlier model of
that same device,

22:48.492 --> 22:51.745
possibly a prototype,
built very early
in their evolution .

22:52.371 --> 22:55.915
ln my experience,
the 1 . 0 version's
usually the most buggy.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.959
lt's also the simplest.

22:58.669 --> 23:02.464
Maybe it's really simple.
Maybe it just tells
you how to fly the ship.

23:03.924 --> 23:08.428
Well , l'm sure it's
a bit more than that,
but your point is well made.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.473
lt's knowledge of
this ship we need .

23:12.600 --> 23:16.478
lf we're to survive,
or, for that matter,
get back to Earth one day,

23:17.229 --> 23:20.648
then l'm convinced
that this chair is
the only way to do that.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.902
Maybe there's
a way of choosing

23:23.986 --> 23:25.195
what information
gets downloaded .

23:25.279 --> 23:27.072
Or maybe it's
just a matter of
slowing down the download

23:27.156 --> 23:28.656
so it can be cut off.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.035
There's only one
way to find out.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.164
This is our priority now.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.632
(SlG H l NG)

23:46.592 --> 23:47.967
l don't get it.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.597

make the hard decisions.

37:57.651 --> 38:00.444
The life and death decisions.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.949
Well , that makes
you a liability.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.868
l'm not proud of what l did ,

38:08.703 --> 38:11.747
but l did it for
the benefit of
everyone onboard .

38:11.831 --> 38:13.958
The end justifies the means?

38:15.293 --> 38:17.044
Yeah , something like that.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.913
Are we done?

38:53.665 --> 38:55.124
We'll never be done.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.777
We shouldn't have
left them there.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.154
What? So we could
get stuck there, too?

39:25.238 --> 39:26.947
No one is stuck!

39:27.032 --> 39:29.116
Not yet. How much time?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.325
Twenty seconds.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.802
SCOTT: Colonel?

39:48.887 --> 39:50.137
Where's Rush?

39:50.638 --> 39:52.056
He didn't make it.

40:04.611 --> 40:07.112
YOU NG : So, we just stayed
too long .

40:07.197 --> 40:09.198
On the way back,
Rush tripped himself up,

40:09.282 --> 40:11.909
started a rock slide. . .
l was ahead ,

40:11.993 --> 40:14.161
but l just. . .
l barely made it through .

40:17.123 --> 40:20.959
l just wanted you
to know, Colonel ,
that l've informed the crew

40:21.044 --> 40:23.796
of the new evidence
that's come to light.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.672
Since you've been
completely exonerated ,

40:25.757 --> 40:29.009
obviously you should
resume your duties
as commander.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.177
JOHANSEN : Tomorrow.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.806
You need to rest.
She can be in
charge one more day.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.022
Thanks.

40:49.322 --> 40:52.366
Eli , shut the door.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.377
The rest of the Kino footage?

41:04.754 --> 41:06.463
Even Scott didn't see it.

41:06.548 --> 41:09.633
l want you to
make a copy for me,
put it on this,

41:09.717 --> 41:12.094
and then delete it
from your hard drive.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.100
Okay.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.396
Anything else?

41:24.315 --> 41:25.315
No.

43:33.361 --> 43:34.361
English - US - PSDH
