You either look
like a man or a woman.

52:39.750 --> 52:43.125
Don't...bring us
any of your other shit."

52:43.125 --> 52:46.792
So they're essentially saying,

52:46.792 --> 52:48.166
"Don't make me work too hard

52:48.166 --> 52:52.166
to see you on your own terms,"
right?

52:52.166 --> 52:53.959
[audience murmuring]

52:53.959 --> 52:58.000
But we have the God-given right
to be who we are.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.667
Not who others want us to be.

53:01.667 --> 53:04.417
So when they say shit like,

53:04.417 --> 53:07.959
"Don't use fake words
like 'nonbinary'

53:07.959 --> 53:11.291
or 'gender-fluid,'
'cis-whatever,'" it's like...

53:14.166 --> 53:16.583
Those are my terms, bitch.

53:16.583 --> 53:18.500
Mm-hmm, yep.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.458
[cheers and applause]

53:25.709 --> 53:27.375
Mm-hmm.

53:30.333 --> 53:34.458
Which means we have to be
so big,

53:34.458 --> 53:35.792
so noisy...

53:35.792 --> 53:38.041
that there's nowhere else
to look.

53:38.041 --> 53:41.417
And we do it in God's name
because...

53:43.166 --> 53:45.875
[chuckles]
Because God hates haters.
