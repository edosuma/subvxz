WEBVTT

00:11.105 --> 00:12.706
"You and Jess broke up."

00:15.643 --> 00:17.644
Oh, man.

00:19.914 --> 00:21.448
"The bed got burned."

00:25.286 --> 00:27.454
I thought it was a dream.

00:27.488 --> 00:29.255
"It was a not a dream."

00:29.290 --> 00:30.657
I'm a little scared to see

00:30.691 --> 00:31.891
what's on the other side.

00:33.661 --> 00:35.762
"Writing left-handed is HARB."

00:46.674 --> 00:47.674
Oh!

00:47.708 --> 00:49.275
Goodness. Hi. Sorry.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.944
I was just changing
in the closet,

00:50.978 --> 00:52.312
like Superman.

00:52.346 --> 00:54.481
Are we still allowed
to see each other naked?

00:54.515 --> 00:55.682
- Yes.
- Do you think so?

00:55.716 --> 00:56.616
I don't know.

00:56.651 --> 00:57.984
- Hmm.
- Maybe.

00:58.019 --> 00:59.252
- Ah...
- Definitely not.

00:59.286 --> 01:00.387
"Derfi-niddley nit."

01:02.456 --> 01:05.224
Boob season's over, for you.

01:05.259 --> 01:07.394
- Mind if I grab my socks?
- Um, no. You can go ahead.

01:07.428 --> 01:08.495
- I'll close my eyes.
- Okay.

01:09.897 --> 01:11.331
- Hey!
- Whoa!

01:11.365 --> 01:13.566
So how you doing?

01:13.601 --> 01:14.768
- I'm really good.
- Good.

01:14.802 --> 01:16.336
- How 'bout you?
- Great.

01:16.370 --> 01:17.737
Yeah, I'm really enjoying the breakup.

01:17.772 --> 01:19.239
- Yeah.
- I think I'm handling it well.

01:19.273 --> 01:20.674
Yeah, you are.
You are.

01:20.708 --> 01:22.242
You're. You know,
you're not drunk,

01:22.276 --> 01:23.476
you haven't left me
300 voicemails...

01:23.511 --> 01:24.678
And you're not crying while

01:24.712 --> 01:25.879
watching that movie Ghost.

01:25.913 --> 01:27.447
Well, it's Dirty Dancing.

01:27.481 --> 01:29.616
Doesn't Swayze do
a dirty dance with that clay?

01:29.650 --> 01:31.384
That's not Dirty Dancing.

01:31.419 --> 01:34.387
It's Ghost.
It's a different movie.

01:34.422 --> 01:36.022
Which one takes place at camp?

01:36.057 --> 01:38.024
Dirty Dancing.

01:38.059 --> 01:39.826
Which one's Whoopi in?

01:39.860 --> 01:41.361
Stop asking me
questions about them.

01:41.395 --> 01:42.562
Drop it.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.635
So I saw this TV show
about monkeys in India,

01:48.669 --> 01:50.870
and one of the monkeys,
when it gets nervous

01:50.905 --> 01:52.739
and it wants to play
submissive, it goes like this:

01:54.842 --> 01:56.476
And that lets all
the other monkeys know

01:56.510 --> 01:58.044
it doesn't want trouble.

01:58.079 --> 02:00.714
That's cool.

02:00.748 --> 02:03.450
They also give each other
oral pleasure.

02:03.484 --> 02:05.485
And they masturbate.

02:13.461 --> 02:15.362
So what do we do now, Jess?

02:15.396 --> 02:16.596
Well, normally, I would go home,

02:16.631 --> 02:17.797
but I already am home, so...

02:17.832 --> 02:18.999
can't do that.

02:19.033 --> 02:20.400
I know where you live.

02:20.434 --> 02:21.668
And I live where you live.

02:21.702 --> 02:23.603
Should we tell the
people we live with?

02:23.638 --> 02:25.372
- Yeah, let's do that.

- No, my uncle was on Cops

02:45.860 --> 02:47.427
a bunch of times.

02:47.461 --> 02:48.728
He got no residuals, though.
He's poor.

02:48.763 --> 02:50.497
That really is big news!

02:50.531 --> 02:51.698
Big news.

02:51.732 --> 02:54.200
What a happy,
happy day! Huzzah!

02:54.235 --> 02:57.237
And to celebrate, I'm gonna have
a banquet in my honor.

02:57.271 --> 02:59.372
A banquet for yourself?
That seems tacky.

02:59.407 --> 03:01.174
Can anyone here
think of any reason

03:01.208 --> 03:03.877
why today should not be
all about me?

Nah, it doesn't seem
like the right move.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.125
Yeah.
So we have to pretend

03:19.160 --> 03:20.660
to be a couple
for one more day.

03:20.695 --> 03:21.861
It's not that big of a deal.

03:21.896 --> 03:23.863
- It's gonna be easy.
- Yeah.

03:23.898 --> 03:25.699
So we broke up.
What's the difference?

03:25.733 --> 03:27.033
Um...

03:27.068 --> 03:28.902
I-I couldn't be more okay with it.

03:28.936 --> 03:31.638
Well, I couldn't be more okay, either.

03:31.672 --> 03:32.806
Great. Me, too.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.175
Capital "O," capital "K"

03:35.209 --> 03:37.444
capital "A," capital "Y."

03:37.478 --> 03:38.778
I'm okay.

03:38.813 --> 03:40.780
I'm not okay, Mom.

03:42.016 --> 03:43.483
I'm not okay.

03:43.517 --> 03:44.584
I'm not okay.

03:44.619 --> 03:46.453
I'm sorry to pull you

03:46.487 --> 03:47.921
out of your dance class.

03:49.123 --> 03:51.925
Oh, the recital was today?

03:51.959 --> 03:54.694
I know we did the right thing,
I just... I feel like...

03:54.729 --> 03:57.197
really upset, and...

03:57.231 --> 03:59.065
Nick seems totally okay

03:59.100 --> 04:01.968
and I guess I just need someone
to tell me it's gonna be fine.

04:02.003 --> 04:04.671
It's not gonna be fine, Jess.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.873
I'm never gonna be a grandmother!

04:06.908 --> 04:08.508
What? Mom...

04:08.542 --> 04:09.910
Stop crying.

04:09.944 --> 04:11.645
You don't even have
to love him, honey.

04:11.679 --> 04:13.446
You just have to get
that sperm cooking!

04:13.481 --> 04:16.382
- Mom...
- I'm sorry, honey, I just...

04:16.416 --> 04:18.385
You know, this is where
I'm at right now.

04:18.418 --> 04:19.586
Well, this was really
comforting, Mom.

04:21.189 --> 04:23.590
It's like I'm in the womb,
sucking my thumb.

04:23.624 --> 04:25.992
Look, of course she doesn't know
I'm in pain, Tran.

04:26.027 --> 04:27.961
I'm hiding it
like you're supposed to.

04:27.995 --> 04:30.697
But I'm lying to my best friend.

04:30.731 --> 04:34.134
You're also my best friend, don't...

04:34.168 --> 04:37.604
don't start that weird jazz train.

04:37.638 --> 04:40.073
I don't know how I'm gonna
hold it all together.

04:40.107 --> 04:42.409
I can't talk about it
with anyone all day.

04:42.443 --> 04:43.910
I feel like a piñata, you know,

04:43.945 --> 04:45.445
and I'm just gonna pop.

04:46.981 --> 04:49.416
What does that mean:

04:49.450 --> 04:51.618
"The problem is the solution?"

04:51.652 --> 04:55.422
Oh, you mean just focus
myself on Winston,

04:55.456 --> 04:58.425
and I won't have time
to think about Jess.

04:58.459 --> 05:01.027
That's really smart,
but that's not exactly

05:01.062 --> 05:02.429
"the problem is the solution."

05:02.463 --> 05:03.663
Do you know what I mean?

05:03.698 --> 05:05.765
That's, like, a cool sentence, but...

05:05.800 --> 05:07.901
it's more just "stay busy," right?

05:09.637 --> 05:11.171
Thanks, Tran.

05:11.205 --> 05:13.607
If I'd met you in your prime,
during the war,

05:13.641 --> 05:15.075
that would have been glorious!

05:15.109 --> 05:16.243
But then we would've been enemies

05:16.277 --> 05:18.044
and tried to murder one another,

05:18.079 --> 05:19.946
unless we formed an alliance.

05:19.981 --> 05:21.147
Oh...

05:21.182 --> 05:23.550
You and me forming an alliance

05:23.584 --> 05:24.784
in an old-school war?

05:24.819 --> 05:26.520
That's a fantasy.

05:26.554 --> 05:28.021
Or a novel.

05:28.055 --> 05:29.456
You just gave me another idea.

05:30.725 --> 05:31.958
Winston?

05:31.993 --> 05:33.627
I've been thinking about it,

05:33.661 --> 05:35.829
and a banquet is not big enough.

05:35.863 --> 05:37.264
You're not retiring from some

05:37.298 --> 05:39.199
insurance company.

05:39.233 --> 05:40.667
So what do you really want,

05:40.701 --> 05:42.135
besides a piñata?

05:42.170 --> 05:43.036
Dream big.

05:43.070 --> 05:44.237
Dream big, he said.

05:44.272 --> 05:45.639
Okay. Um...

05:45.673 --> 05:46.840
If I had my druthers...

05:46.874 --> 05:48.308
you know, 100% of my druthers...

05:48.342 --> 05:49.309
I...

05:49.343 --> 05:51.111
I gotta go Honey Roast.

05:51.145 --> 05:52.646
The hell is that?
And don't say it

05:52.680 --> 05:53.847
like it's some thing we know!

05:53.881 --> 05:55.115
It's a roast,

05:55.149 --> 05:56.783
except you say nice things about me.

05:56.818 --> 05:58.852
Honey Roast.

05:59.554 --> 06:00.821
- Huh.
- You know?

06:00.855 --> 06:02.689
Well, I can't wait
to make that happen for you.

06:02.723 --> 06:04.624
- You serious?
- He thinks you're serious.

06:04.659 --> 06:06.159
- How do I do it?
- You just get everybody

06:06.194 --> 06:07.794
to say a bunch of
cute stuff about me.

06:07.829 --> 06:09.429
You know, all the, like,

06:09.463 --> 06:11.431
funny stuff that makes me
sweet, you know?

06:11.465 --> 06:12.666
Done! What else?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.901
What? There's... There's more?

06:14.936 --> 06:16.536
Uh...

06:16.571 --> 06:18.738
make me a prominent chair.

06:18.773 --> 06:19.606
- Like a throne?
- Come on.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.607
A throne?

06:20.641 --> 06:21.608
Who am I, CeeLo?

06:21.642 --> 06:22.876
No, I just...

06:22.910 --> 06:24.177
This is me, I'm still the same person.

06:24.212 --> 06:26.179
- Stop touching me.
- I'm not gonna change.

06:26.214 --> 06:27.681
- I'm still the same person.
- Stop touching me.

06:27.715 --> 06:29.216
So make me a prominent chair.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.617
Then you shall have that, Winston.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.618
What else you want?

06:31.652 --> 06:32.819
I'm thinking maybe

06:32.854 --> 06:34.287
you should MC my roast.

06:34.322 --> 06:35.789
Okay, I will.

06:35.823 --> 06:37.290
And can you do it
dressed as Furguson?

06:39.093 --> 06:40.227
I'm not gonna do that.

06:40.261 --> 06:41.361
Thought it might be special.

06:41.395 --> 06:43.029
Nah, it's strange.

06:43.064 --> 06:44.197
All right, I'm gonna get
started on that chair.

06:44.232 --> 06:45.298
Well, this just in:

06:45.333 --> 06:46.766
the dress code for

06:46.801 --> 06:48.001
Winston's banquet tonight is...

06:48.035 --> 06:49.936
is opt... is optional.

06:49.971 --> 06:51.304
Why would he write "optional" there?

06:51.339 --> 06:52.639
That's gotta be a mistake, right?

06:52.673 --> 06:54.007
And they're gonna give him a gun?

06:54.041 --> 06:55.308
What are you doing back there?

06:57.178 --> 06:59.946
Thought it was about time
I graduated high school.

06:59.981 --> 07:01.648
- Mmm...
- I'm proud of you.

07:01.682 --> 07:02.849
That's it?

07:02.884 --> 07:04.684
No snide comments?

07:04.719 --> 07:05.752
I've got legions.

07:05.786 --> 07:06.887
But I'm gonna be supportive.

07:07.822 --> 07:10.657
"Legions" means "a lot."

07:10.691 --> 07:12.292
I know what "legions" means.

07:12.326 --> 07:13.760
Anyway, I probably won't
even take the test.

07:13.794 --> 07:15.695
I failed the last five practice exams.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.264
So that seems like a bad sign.

07:17.298 --> 07:18.832
Of course you're failing.

07:18.866 --> 07:20.800
You're studying here
in a rowdy tavern.

07:20.835 --> 07:23.170
Chumbawamba's playing,
it's not even "Tubthumping."

07:23.204 --> 07:24.671
You're writing with what looks to be

07:24.705 --> 07:26.907
a golf pencil.
Where are your flash cards?

07:26.941 --> 07:28.708
Do you not have
o-one single flash card?

07:28.743 --> 07:30.010
There's maraschino goo everywhere!

07:30.044 --> 07:31.244
You don't have a flash card?

07:31.279 --> 07:32.679
I'm taking over.
You need a tutor.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.880
Yes, I'll do it.

07:33.915 --> 07:35.215
You realize I have
a boyfriend, right?

07:35.249 --> 07:36.249
Oh, the hunky Australian boy?

07:36.284 --> 07:37.517
Congratulations.

07:37.552 --> 07:39.085
Cece, this is about your education.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.720
- Nothing more.
- Mm.

07:40.755 --> 07:43.356
He's actually from Perth, so...

07:43.391 --> 07:45.459
Perth is in Australia, Cece.

07:45.493 --> 07:47.494
We'll start with geography.

07:51.740 --> 07:52.873
Oh, Cece, I really need...

07:54.776 --> 07:56.510
to ask Schmidt

07:56.544 --> 07:58.746
if my outfit's working.

07:58.780 --> 08:00.814
It is not.

08:02.217 --> 08:03.984
I was in the middle of tutoring Cece!

08:04.019 --> 08:06.287
- Make it quick!
- I know why you're upset, okay?

08:06.321 --> 08:07.788
I should've asked you to tutor me.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.423
But he just volunteered,

08:09.457 --> 08:11.492
and I figured you'd
be busy with Nick.

08:11.526 --> 08:13.727
Well, I'm not busy with Nick anymore.

08:13.762 --> 08:15.896
Oh, no.

08:15.931 --> 08:17.898
Did you guys break up?

08:20.735 --> 08:22.136
Jess, are you pregnant?

08:25.840 --> 08:27.775
I feel like I made it weird with
the pregnancy thing, you guys.

08:27.809 --> 08:29.243
Did I make it weird with
the pregnancy thing?

08:29.277 --> 08:30.578
'Cause I really feel like I did.

08:30.612 --> 08:32.379
I feel like, in my heart,
that that was a...

08:32.414 --> 08:34.448
that was the wrong to say,
especially to two women

08:34.482 --> 08:36.784
who are sitting alone
in a room together.

08:36.818 --> 08:38.953
You know, I don't know where
you guys are at with your lives

08:38.986 --> 08:40.854
But you're certainly
getting up to an age

08:40.889 --> 08:42.789
where babies are on your mind,
and-and I didn't want

08:42.823 --> 08:44.425
to throw that into the mix.
I could see

08:44.459 --> 08:45.926
that you were emotional,
Jess, when you left,

08:45.961 --> 08:47.595
and I, and I don't want
to make you more emotional

08:47.629 --> 08:49.363
by bringing up pregnancy.

08:49.397 --> 08:52.166
And, Cece, you can probably
barely spell "pregnancy."

08:52.200 --> 08:54.868
And I feel terrible.

08:54.903 --> 08:56.937
Are you frickin'
razzing me in there?

08:56.972 --> 08:58.472
Did I just here a razz?

08:58.506 --> 08:59.506
Damn it!

09:01.610 --> 09:04.044
So you're really building
Winston's throne, huh?

09:04.079 --> 09:05.779
It's a prominent chair.

09:05.814 --> 09:09.416
And it's not right!
It's not regal enough!

09:09.451 --> 09:11.727
- How long have you been doing this?
- It's for the Honey Roast.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.454
I'm trying to think of cute
things to say about Winston.

09:13.488 --> 09:14.755
I got great stuff about his feet.

09:14.789 --> 09:16.824
What are you saying, dude?
You sound insane.

09:16.858 --> 09:19.760
If anything's cute about
Winston, it's his yawn.

09:24.332 --> 09:26.567
He goes, like...

09:26.601 --> 09:28.536
- Can I use that?
- You're scaring me, man.

09:28.570 --> 09:31.472
Like, for real.
Like, I'm scared for you.

09:31.506 --> 09:33.941
Don't do that voice 'cause
it makes me confess things.

09:33.975 --> 09:35.476
I'm really scared for you.

09:35.510 --> 09:38.012
- I broke up with Jess.
- You broke...

09:38.046 --> 09:40.447
- You broke up with Jess?!
- I broke up with Jess.

09:40.482 --> 09:42.316
- Aw, man.
- It's real.

09:42.350 --> 09:43.817
Or she broke up with me, I
don't know, but we're broken up.

09:43.852 --> 09:45.519
Well, at least that explains
all of that.

09:45.554 --> 09:46.787
Kind of.

09:46.821 --> 09:48.822
I just feel like I'm falling apart.

09:48.857 --> 09:50.791
Like, my brain feels like spaghetti.

09:50.825 --> 09:52.092
And my future feels

09:52.127 --> 09:53.360
like a dark hole

09:53.395 --> 09:54.995
that I can't stop falling down.

09:55.030 --> 09:57.198
You can't show her this pain.

09:57.232 --> 09:58.866
Or she'll freak out
and it'll be over, okay?

09:58.900 --> 10:00.234
I wish someone
would've told me that

10:00.268 --> 10:01.869
when Malia and I broke up.

10:01.903 --> 10:03.337
Malia, I'm in pain

10:03.371 --> 10:06.073
and I want you to know!

10:06.107 --> 10:09.810
I want to get this pain
out of my body!

10:11.079 --> 10:12.646
I haven't seen her since.

10:12.681 --> 10:14.815
I still read her e-mails, though.

10:14.850 --> 10:16.450
- Every day.
- Every day.

10:16.484 --> 10:18.519
- Every damn day.
- Every day.

10:18.553 --> 10:21.088
You have to hide your feelings
no matter what.

10:21.122 --> 10:23.891
And I am. She thinks I'm okay.
That's my game plan.

10:23.925 --> 10:25.726
I'm talking about pills, man.
Schmidt's got

10:25.760 --> 10:27.928
some anxiety pills
in his top drawer, you know?

10:27.963 --> 10:29.730
- That's a great idea.
- Do it.

10:29.764 --> 10:32.566
Don't tell any of the roommates
about the breakup.

10:32.601 --> 10:34.338
Thought I made it clear that
I do not want to talk about this.

10:34.507 --> 10:35.521
Sure.

10:35.770 --> 10:38.572
He just seemed so fine with it.

10:39.674 --> 10:41.075
Like he's happier

10:41.109 --> 10:43.043
than me watching Coach

10:43.078 --> 10:44.812
watching Winston yawn.

10:54.189 --> 10:56.991
I'm sure he's just as sad as you are.

10:57.025 --> 10:58.092
It's an act.

10:58.126 --> 10:59.727
You need to go and talk to him

10:59.761 --> 11:02.062
so he can tell you
how he really feels.

11:03.698 --> 11:04.765
I'll go with you, okay?

11:04.799 --> 11:07.067
- Thanks.
- Of course.

11:07.102 --> 11:09.436
Are you guys Frenching?

11:09.471 --> 11:11.071
Okay, say you're Frenching
and I'll stop knocking.

11:11.106 --> 11:12.673
Ignore him, okay?
Just ignore him.

11:14.184 --> 11:16.205
Remember Cece,
no one knows we broke up.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.440
- Not a word.
- Nope.

11:18.475 --> 11:21.076
- Hey!
- Come here, you.

11:22.278 --> 11:23.312
Why are we doing this?

11:23.346 --> 11:25.180
Uh...

11:25.215 --> 11:27.282
this is, uh, how I,
how I greet everyone now.

11:27.317 --> 11:30.519
And then I, uh, do this.

11:30.553 --> 11:31.587
- Then do that.
- Oh.

11:31.621 --> 11:32.588
And top it off

11:32.622 --> 11:33.789
with a little bit of that.

11:33.823 --> 11:34.923
You feel me?

11:34.958 --> 11:36.025
This is how you greet everybody now?

11:36.059 --> 11:37.893
Ah, come here, you.

11:37.927 --> 11:39.762
Uh, that wasn't an invitation.

11:42.666 --> 11:43.499
Nick, hi!

11:43.533 --> 11:44.633
Son of a bitch!
Come here, you.

11:44.668 --> 11:46.168
What are you doing, man?

11:46.202 --> 11:48.871
- You take the pills?
- Uh, I feel as if I'm of cotton.

11:48.905 --> 11:50.239
Sorry for what's about to happen.

11:55.211 --> 11:57.680
Do you have a minute
to maybe have a conversation

11:57.714 --> 11:59.014
with your sweet, sweet girlfriend?

12:02.719 --> 12:04.486
I think the only way
we're gonna get through this

12:04.521 --> 12:06.088
is if we're really honest
with each other

12:06.122 --> 12:07.489
about how we're really feeling.

12:07.524 --> 12:08.691
This morning I told you

12:08.725 --> 12:10.793
I was okay, and...

12:13.029 --> 12:14.229
Why are you winking at me?

12:14.264 --> 12:15.664
- Am I winking?
- Yeah.

12:15.699 --> 12:17.266
I think I'm just a little nervous.

12:17.300 --> 12:20.169
I'm gonna put my sunglasses on
so we can keep talking.

12:20.203 --> 12:22.004
- Okay, okay.
- 'Cause I don't think I can stop this.

12:22.038 --> 12:23.138
Please continue with
what you were saying.

12:23.173 --> 12:25.240
Um, I just, um,

12:25.275 --> 12:27.109
want you to tell me
how you really feel.

12:27.143 --> 12:30.012
- Great.
- Gre... I'm sorry, "Great"?

12:30.046 --> 12:31.947
- I feel great.
- Is great the, the, uh,

12:31.982 --> 12:33.349
is the emotion you feel right now?

12:33.383 --> 12:34.750
- No.
- Oh.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.587
I feel amazing.

12:39.756 --> 12:41.290
- "Amazing"?
- Yeah.

12:41.324 --> 12:43.592
You feel amazing right now?

12:43.627 --> 12:45.194
I just feel happier and amazing

12:45.228 --> 12:46.762
and lighter.

12:46.796 --> 12:48.697
Tonight's about Winston.

12:48.732 --> 12:50.499
You don't have to worry about me
'cause I'm worried

12:50.533 --> 12:51.767
about the Honey Roast.

12:51.801 --> 12:53.168
I'm sorry I forgot

12:53.203 --> 12:55.237
that Winston is
the most important thing

12:55.271 --> 12:57.139
that's going on today.

12:57.173 --> 12:58.240
That's where I'm putting
all my energies.

12:58.275 --> 12:59.975
Fan...

13:00.010 --> 13:02.411
tastic.

13:02.445 --> 13:04.413
Took a long time to say that word.

13:04.447 --> 13:06.348
There you are!

13:06.383 --> 13:09.084
- We're supposed to be studying.
- Come here, you.

13:09.119 --> 13:10.919
Ah, thanks, Coach.
I needed this.

13:12.022 --> 13:14.657
Mm. Delightful.

13:14.691 --> 13:16.125
To you, too, my friend.

13:16.159 --> 13:17.159
That is super weird.

13:17.193 --> 13:18.694
What is wrong with you?

13:18.728 --> 13:20.562
What are you scared
of a couple practice tests?

13:20.597 --> 13:22.031
Just something more important
came up, that's all.

13:22.065 --> 13:23.332
There should be nothing

13:23.366 --> 13:25.834
more important to you, Cece,
than your future.

13:25.869 --> 13:27.236
Because nothing is more important

13:27.270 --> 13:28.671
to me than your future.

13:28.705 --> 13:30.239
Do you know how stupid
it makes me feel

13:30.273 --> 13:32.041
to care more about
your future than you do?

13:33.376 --> 13:34.777
Nick and Jess broke up.

13:34.811 --> 13:36.645
I knew you knew!

13:36.680 --> 13:37.646
- Oh!
- I knew it!

13:37.681 --> 13:38.914
So, you knew, too.

13:38.949 --> 13:41.250
But you knew and you told.

13:41.284 --> 13:43.118
Look, that was so sweet
of you, Schmidt.

13:43.153 --> 13:45.054
Okay? And thank you
for believing in me...

13:45.088 --> 13:47.638
- Who gives a rat's A?!
- Hmm?

13:47.688 --> 13:49.536
Nick and Jess break up.
and you spring this on me

13:49.571 --> 13:51.627
like a, like it's
a freaking weather report?

13:51.661 --> 13:54.897
I am a child of divorce!
I'm delicate!

13:54.931 --> 13:57.599
Should've graduated the first
time around, you buffoon!

13:57.634 --> 13:59.101
Better keep it together, dude.
No one can know you know.

13:59.135 --> 14:01.637
Guess what, Cece?

14:01.671 --> 14:03.138
My boyfriend Nick

14:03.173 --> 14:05.074
is totally frickin' fine.

14:05.108 --> 14:07.176
He's actually, he's "amazing."

14:07.210 --> 14:08.811
Okay, wine.

14:08.845 --> 14:11.280
Yeah, make it a big one.
A holiday pour.

14:11.314 --> 14:12.948
'Cause today's all about Winston.

14:12.983 --> 14:14.249
Yeah, it's all about Winston.

14:15.919 --> 14:17.319
Somebody say Winston?

14:18.521 --> 14:19.922
- Whoa!
- What?

14:19.956 --> 14:24.126
Guys, I gotta say, I am walking
on air, I really am.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.127
It's, uh...

14:25.161 --> 14:26.128
Excuse me for a second.

14:26.162 --> 14:27.730
Hey, Winston!

14:27.764 --> 14:30.966
Hey, it's your day!
I'm diving in! What can I do?

14:31.001 --> 14:33.869
'Cause today is all about Winston.

14:33.903 --> 14:34.970
Yeah, all about Winston.

14:35.005 --> 14:37.139
- Whatever you want, buddy.
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.173 --> 14:38.574
Anything?

14:38.608 --> 14:40.209
My name is Nick Miller

14:40.243 --> 14:43.512
and I'm your host of
tonight's Honey Roast.

14:43.546 --> 14:45.514
Thank you! Thank you!

14:45.548 --> 14:48.717
And I'm Furguson the cat.

14:48.752 --> 14:50.185
Ya-ya!

14:51.817 --> 14:54.285
Okay, uh, tonight's Honey Roast,
we're gonna keep it sweet,

14:54.720 --> 14:57.688
keep it positive, and most of
all, we're gonna keep it cute.

14:57.723 --> 14:59.023
Am I right, Furguson?

15:01.393 --> 15:02.693
Hope that cat's not driving.

15:02.728 --> 15:04.995
How is a cat costume
just lying around?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.564
She has four of them.

15:06.598 --> 15:08.504
I'm drinking a "Catbernet."

15:10.135 --> 15:11.102
- That's pretty good.
- Okay.

15:11.136 --> 15:12.136
That's pretty good.

15:13.004 --> 15:14.305
A Pinot "meowoir..."

15:14.339 --> 15:15.773
Meow-oi-rr.

15:15.807 --> 15:18.909
If I have one more of these,
you're gonna have to point

15:18.944 --> 15:21.512
this old kitty in the direction
of my litter box

15:21.546 --> 15:24.582
because I'm gonna need to find it.

15:24.616 --> 15:26.584
Mm, let's keep it cute, guys.

15:26.618 --> 15:28.552
'Cause I'm gonna have to pee.

15:28.587 --> 15:31.622
Speaking of cute,
Winston Bishop is so cute...

15:31.656 --> 15:33.724
How cute is he?

15:33.759 --> 15:35.026
How cute am I?

15:35.060 --> 15:36.992
Teddy bears buy Winston
for their kids.

15:38.430 --> 15:40.831
That was good.
That is exactly how cute I am.

15:40.866 --> 15:42.733
- Horrible visual.
- Want to know how cute you are?

15:42.768 --> 15:43.768
Yeah, I want to know how cute I am.

15:43.802 --> 15:44.735
You want to know how cute you are?

15:44.770 --> 15:45.736
I want to know how cute I am.

15:45.771 --> 15:46.637
Puppys put him...

15:46.671 --> 15:47.905
Not gonna do that one.

15:47.939 --> 15:49.507
Are we still pretending
that we don't...

15:49.541 --> 15:51.876
- Relax. Keep it together.
- Mm-hmm, it'll be over soon.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.045
- Pretend like you're enjoying this. Smile.
- Mm-hmm.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.448
Winston is so cute, he once met
a Japanese gal named Ariko,

15:57.482 --> 15:59.884
and she started
wearing him as a backpack!

16:01.686 --> 16:03.587
Boom!

16:03.622 --> 16:07.258
Ooh! I did not see
that one coming! Oh, my!

16:07.292 --> 16:08.993
- I didn't expect it either.
- Surprise ending!

16:09.027 --> 16:12.196
I think it's time,
I think it's time

16:12.230 --> 16:13.964
that this cat takes over.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.000
Why hold back?

16:16.034 --> 16:17.802
I feel like we should make this

16:17.836 --> 16:19.303
- a real roast.
- Yeah.

16:19.337 --> 16:21.138
- Don't do that.
- Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

16:21.173 --> 16:22.973
I'm kind of scared,
but I'm also kind of excited.

16:23.008 --> 16:25.042
- I think, actually, it's my turn to...
- It's my turn!

16:25.077 --> 16:26.811
- Uh... mm-mm.
- Okay, back here.

16:26.845 --> 16:27.812
This is the best idea.

16:27.846 --> 16:29.146
I think I should sit down.

16:29.181 --> 16:30.514
Getting a little mean.

16:30.549 --> 16:31.549
Time to add some honey.

16:31.583 --> 16:32.983
Who's in the house?

16:33.018 --> 16:34.151
Coach is in the house.

16:34.186 --> 16:35.653
What-what?

16:35.687 --> 16:37.088
What's up, Coach?

16:37.122 --> 16:40.424
You have so many sweatpants,
you need to buy normal pants.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.128
Cece here.

16:44.162 --> 16:45.463
You guys know Cece.

16:45.497 --> 16:48.707
- Your hair's so long.
- Well, you're basically busted.

16:48.743 --> 16:49.748
- Good one.
- That was good.

16:49.799 --> 16:50.907
- That was really a good one.
- That was a good one.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.276
- Schmidt...
- Jess, please, don't.

16:52.316 --> 16:53.427
I'm very fragile right now.

16:53.462 --> 16:55.639
Your head's so big.

16:55.674 --> 16:56.907
That actually wasn't that bad.

16:56.942 --> 16:58.476
You got a big-ass head, dude!

16:58.510 --> 16:59.477
And Nick Miller...

16:59.511 --> 17:01.078
Oh, boy.

17:01.113 --> 17:04.214
What can I say about Nick
that hasn't already been said?

17:04.249 --> 17:05.281
Oh, here we go.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.586
Nick calls birds "wind mice."

17:08.619 --> 17:09.720
Think about it.

17:09.755 --> 17:12.723
- Nick says "Yahtzee" when he climaxes.
- Oh, boy.

17:12.758 --> 17:15.192
He calls turtles "shell beavers."

17:15.227 --> 17:17.494
Well, that's what
they should be called.

17:17.529 --> 17:19.663
They're green.
Beavers are brown.

17:19.698 --> 17:21.398
We've had this argument
and we have agreed

17:21.433 --> 17:23.334
to not talk about it
in front of others.

17:23.367 --> 17:24.835
But you know the worst,

17:24.869 --> 17:27.070
worst, worst thing about Nick?

17:27.105 --> 17:30.007
- You don't have to say it. You just...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

17:30.042 --> 17:33.911
He's okay.

17:33.945 --> 17:35.613
He's okay.

17:35.647 --> 17:37.181
And I am...

17:37.215 --> 17:41.052
not okay.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.754
I'm not okay.

17:43.789 --> 17:45.790
What are you talking about?

17:46.758 --> 17:48.592
Are you nuts?

17:48.627 --> 17:49.593
I'm falling apart.

17:49.628 --> 17:51.028
Yeah, I...

17:51.063 --> 17:53.497
I'm on Schmidt's
anti-anxiety medicine.

17:53.532 --> 17:54.899
What?!

17:54.933 --> 17:56.701
Yeah, I stole it
from his drawer.

17:56.735 --> 17:57.802
Schmidty's little helpers.

17:57.836 --> 17:59.437
- Ooh.
- Sorry about that.

17:59.471 --> 18:01.672
I'm very much not okay!
I was only acting okay

18:01.707 --> 18:03.007
'cause I thought you were okay.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.375
- I'm not okay.
- I am not okay.

18:04.409 --> 18:05.843
I'm terrible!

18:05.877 --> 18:09.180
I know I'm smiling right now,
but I feel terrible.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.781
- I'm so happy...
- Yeah.

18:10.816 --> 18:12.149
...that you feel terrible.

18:12.184 --> 18:13.153
It's a devastating breakup.

18:13.919 --> 18:15.059
- You know, I know we lived together.
- It's really hard.

18:15.089 --> 18:16.563
- It's tricky, you know?
- Yeah.

18:17.089 --> 18:18.409
- You know, it sucks.
- I really thought we had a future.

18:18.444 --> 18:20.417
Me, too. Yeah, saw
the whole thing, the whole thing.

18:20.589 --> 18:22.744
- And now we don't. It's done, yeah.
- We have nothing in common.

18:22.853 --> 18:23.882
Yeah.

18:23.962 --> 18:26.063
I also can't stop smiling
because of the drugs,

18:26.098 --> 18:27.264
so my face feels crazy.

18:27.299 --> 18:28.699
It feels like I had plastic surgery.

18:28.734 --> 18:29.867
Can somebody please

18:29.901 --> 18:31.936
tell me what the hell
is going on in here?

18:31.970 --> 18:33.471
- You want to do this?
- I think we should.

18:33.505 --> 18:34.872
We broke up!

18:34.906 --> 18:36.407
- We're done. It's over.
- It's all done.

18:36.441 --> 18:38.409
- Are you serious?! What?!
- What?! No!

18:38.443 --> 18:39.944
Come on, guys, it's so obvious.

18:39.978 --> 18:42.079
- Son of a bee sting.
- I mean...

18:42.114 --> 18:43.414
What, you broke up today?

18:43.448 --> 18:45.583
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

18:45.617 --> 18:46.784
Well, why didn't you tell me?

18:46.818 --> 18:49.120
Because we didn't want
to ruin your day.

18:49.154 --> 18:51.989
And I'm so sorry we did.
We're so proud of you

18:52.024 --> 18:53.657
that you got into the police academy,

18:53.692 --> 18:55.993
but we're just, we're in
a really bad zone.

18:56.028 --> 18:58.896
- Yeah, a too bad zone.
- So let's just come out and admit it.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.297
We're in a terrible zone.

19:00.332 --> 19:01.832
Are you kidding me?

19:01.867 --> 19:03.100
Something this big happens

19:03.135 --> 19:05.836
and you guys still look out for me?

19:05.871 --> 19:06.971
I mean, that's... Thank you.

19:07.005 --> 19:09.373
I really appreciate it, you guys,

19:09.408 --> 19:10.908
but I'm here for whatever you need.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.543
Thank you, buddy.

19:19.685 --> 19:22.019
Look, I know this is
super weird and...

19:22.054 --> 19:24.388
definitely high
on anxiety pills but...

19:24.423 --> 19:26.957
I'd like everybody
to hold hands in this moment.

19:26.992 --> 19:28.859
- No.
- Just do it, man. That's it.

19:28.894 --> 19:29.927
- Everybody?
- Oh.

19:29.961 --> 19:32.263
- It's two ladies.
- I'm okay.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.831
This feels good.

19:33.865 --> 19:36.100
Om...

19:42.207 --> 19:44.542
Let's never tell anyone we did this.

19:44.576 --> 19:46.677
Should we all try
to live inside a peach,

19:46.712 --> 19:48.813
or is that weird?

19:48.847 --> 19:52.483
Guys, in light
of what's been going on,

19:52.517 --> 19:54.318
I will be postponing the Honey Roast

19:54.353 --> 19:56.153
- until tomorrow night.
- Okay.

19:56.188 --> 19:57.288
- Ah!
- No.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.289
- No way.
- Not doing this.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.890
We could say everybody come back,

19:59.925 --> 20:01.959
- Sorry, Winston.
- everybody come back the same time, so...

20:01.993 --> 20:04.862
then you guys all get to wear white.

20:17.743 --> 20:18.709
Hi, again.

20:20.979 --> 20:23.347
I'm watching Dirty Dancing.

20:23.382 --> 20:24.982
I know. I've heard
all three screenings.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.184
I just don't understand how
Penny got in trouble.

20:27.219 --> 20:28.953
Well, you know,
it was a different time.

20:28.987 --> 20:30.154
Who wins in a fight?

20:30.188 --> 20:32.957
Swayze from Dirty Dancing

20:32.991 --> 20:34.558
or Swayze from Roadhouse?

20:34.593 --> 20:37.528
I think, uh, To Wong Foo
Swayze would win.

20:37.562 --> 20:38.963
Jess, this is really hard.

20:38.997 --> 20:40.564
I don't know what to do.

20:40.599 --> 20:42.400
I don't know what to call you.

20:42.434 --> 20:44.101
It's like a riddle.

20:44.136 --> 20:45.536
I know!

20:45.570 --> 20:48.305
I don't know where to change
or where to sleep

20:48.340 --> 20:49.874
or where to go to the bathroom.

20:49.908 --> 20:52.276
Well, I know where
to go to the bathroom.

20:52.310 --> 20:54.512
But you know, the social component.

20:56.581 --> 20:59.150
Oh, no.

20:59.184 --> 21:00.317
I'm out of tissues.

21:00.352 --> 21:01.352
I got it.

21:02.654 --> 21:03.621
Heads up!

21:03.655 --> 21:05.923
Oh! Hey.

21:05.957 --> 21:07.525
Thank you.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.528
No problem.
That's what I'm here for.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.830
Good night, honey.

21:12.864 --> 21:14.231
Good night.
