WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:03.371
You keep refusing
to tell me where the key is!

00:03.403 --> 00:08.641
We had to hide the key.
Made it human
and sent it to you.

00:08.676 --> 00:12.179
BUFFY:
Dawn.
What's wrong with Mom?

00:12.212 --> 00:13.714
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy The Vampire Slayer.

00:13.746 --> 00:15.583
I don't know.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.751
Buffy's like nobody else
in the world.
When I'm with her,

00:17.785 --> 00:22.222
it's like half of me
is just on fire. I'm going crazy
if I'm not touching her.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.658
But she doesn't love me.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.928
I know you got a lot
on your mind.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.265
If you decide you wanna
let me in on any of it,
you let me know.

00:32.566 --> 00:37.271
We could go somewhere else.
Someplace more private.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.773
Oh, Sandy, Sandy.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.143
My heart belongs to another.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.280
Besides, I don't go out
with vampires.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.618
Spike, I want you.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.287
God,
I love you so much.

00:54.322 --> 00:58.491
(Gasps)
oh, god, no. Please, no.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.128
Are you okay?

01:01.161 --> 01:03.896
You know the "nothing"
I've been dealing with
the last couple of weeks?

01:03.930 --> 01:06.099
It might not be nothing.
What is it?

01:06.134 --> 01:11.239
I'm staying overnight
at the hospital for observation.
I'm getting a CAT scan.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.888
(Sighs)

02:03.224 --> 02:05.125
What is
a CAT scan exactly?

02:08.662 --> 02:11.998
I don't know.
It's some x-ray, I guess.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.336
Where do they get
the CAT scan from?

02:19.038 --> 02:22.210
I mean, do they
test it on cats or--

02:24.144 --> 02:27.046
Or does the machine
sort of look like
a cat?

02:27.079 --> 02:29.182
Dawn, I'm really--

02:48.168 --> 02:51.838
"Your one-stop spot to shop
for all your occult needs."

02:51.872 --> 02:54.007
Catchy.
Think so?

02:54.040 --> 02:57.478
Uh-huh, in a hard-to-read
sort of way, but I think
it's great.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.913
Oh.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.384
XANDER:
I'm just saying,
I think it's rude.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.854
I wouldn't call it rude.
Rude-ish. Rude-esque.
Whatever you want to call it.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.324
When a person makes
a "destroy all vampires"
date,

03:10.358 --> 03:12.360
it's simple courtesy to
wait for your co-destroyers.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.895
Am I right, Giles?

03:14.927 --> 03:17.497
I'm almost certain
you're not, but to be fair,
I wasn't listening.

03:17.531 --> 03:21.100
Oh, the new phone book's in
with Mr. Giles's ad.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.103
Oh, nice.

03:23.135 --> 03:25.506
Yay! Am I mentioned?

03:25.538 --> 03:28.008
Not as such.
Oh.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.411
Okay, we were supposed
to hook up with Riley
this morning...

03:30.443 --> 03:33.347
To take on a nest o' vamps
holed up in tomb.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.348
So we get there,
and guess what?

03:35.383 --> 03:37.751
-Tell him, Wil.
-Tomb go boom.

03:37.784 --> 03:40.521
Yep, Captain America
blowed it up real good.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.691
All by his lone wolf
lonesome.
Hmm, rather reckless of him.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.925
I'd say very rather.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.961
All that aside,
I should think you'd be pleased
to avoid the confrontation.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.098
That's what
I've been saying.
I mean, I for one,

03:51.131 --> 03:53.066
didn't want to start
my day with a slaughter.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.937
Which really
just goes to show
how much I've grown.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.610
Yes, um, in any event,
since you're all here,

04:02.643 --> 04:07.046
Tara and I could
use your help researching
Buffy's mysterious woman.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.717
Oh, yeah.
This has been fruitful--

04:09.750 --> 04:13.052
Trying to look up
something you never saw
and don't know the name of.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.089
Just do what I do--
flip through the pages
and look busy.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.793
It'd be nice
if we knew where she was,
where she's hiding out.

04:20.827 --> 04:24.964
No doubt lurking around
some sewer or condemned church
or rat-infested warehouse.

04:24.997 --> 04:27.634
You know, the usual haunts.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.571
Most beauteous
and supremely
magnificent one,

04:30.603 --> 04:34.307
this dark spell
I hold in my worthless
and scabby hand...

04:34.341 --> 04:38.646
is our gift to you,
most tingly and wonderful
Glorificus.

04:38.678 --> 04:42.081
Please, call me Glory.
And get up. Looking at you
is hurting my neck.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.752
Forgive me,
shiny special one.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.021
I beg of you to rip out
my inadequate tongue.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.790
Gimme.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.500
Oh.
(Nervous laugh)

04:59.533 --> 05:02.002
I thought--
(laughing)

05:02.035 --> 05:05.773
You should know,
your elaborate
marvelousness,

05:05.805 --> 05:08.776
that this dark incantation
has been lost for eons--

05:08.809 --> 05:10.877
Uh-huh.
And great dangers
have been faced--

05:10.911 --> 05:13.880
Does this pump
make my ankle look bony?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.684
No. No.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.286
No, your terrifically
smooth one.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.221
It is the epitome of ankles.
To touch such an ankle
would be--

05:22.254 --> 05:24.792
But I'm not touching.
I'm backing away.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.360
Ow! Thank you.

05:27.394 --> 05:30.798
-Dreg, is it?
-Yes, Dreg.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.800
Your creamy coolness
has honored me
by speaking my name.

05:33.834 --> 05:38.137
Your voice is like a thousand
sweet songbirds that--
I never tire of hearing that.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.973
Look, just so we're clear.
This spell's gonna work,
right?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.877
I mean, nothing worse
than a gift that doesn't work.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.178
Then I'd have to get all mad
and kill you.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.148
It's this whole big thing.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.082
It will work,
your extremeness,

05:50.117 --> 05:52.586
provided you have
the other items you need.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.555
Don't worry.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.391
I'll have them all right.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.798
I'll have it all.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.971
(theme music playing)

07:02.523 --> 07:04.757
(Dog barking)

07:10.329 --> 07:12.132
(Knocks)

07:12.165 --> 07:14.735
Hello?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.803
Buffy?

07:28.548 --> 07:31.151
(Inhaling deeply)

07:31.184 --> 07:33.120
Mmm...

07:35.855 --> 07:38.826
Mmm.
What are you
doing in here?

07:38.858 --> 07:41.694
What? Me?
I was, um, uh--

07:41.728 --> 07:43.963
What are you doing here?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.466
Looking for the girl who's gonna
rip your arms off...

07:46.500 --> 07:48.367
when she finds out you were
in her bedroom.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.838
Oh, yeah?
Well, me too.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.879
Were you-- were you just
smelling her sweater?

07:58.911 --> 08:00.980
(Scoffs)
no.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.720
Well, yeah,
all right, I did.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.456
It's a predator thing,
nothing wrong with it.

08:09.488 --> 08:12.625
Know your enemy's scent.
Whet the appetite for a hunt.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.797
You know? Mmm.
Ahh, that's the stuff,
slayer musk.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.165
It's bitter and aggravating.
(Growls)

08:20.500 --> 08:22.235
Out.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.240
Hey! Watch it!
Easy.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.843
You're bruising
the leather.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.510
Look, I know for
a bleeding fact...

08:32.546 --> 08:34.648
The Slayer wouldn't mind
me being here.

08:34.682 --> 08:38.317
Right. What's a little sweater
sniffing between sworn enemies?

08:38.350 --> 08:40.419
Your girl in the habit of buying
her enemies drinks?

08:40.452 --> 08:43.523
'Cause she spent the better
part of last night with me,
doing just that.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.092
'Cause you guys
are such tight pals?
Yeah.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.394
That's good.
Tell me another.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.364
Okay. How about this one?
Twice in recent memory,

08:51.398 --> 08:54.835
she's had the lover Wiccas
do a de-invite on the house,
keep out specific vamps.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.238
Ever ask yourself why
she's never taken my name
off the guest list?

08:59.807 --> 09:03.844
Because you're harmless.
Oh, yeah, right.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.614
Takes one to know,
I suppose.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.615
Least I still
got the attitude.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.350
What you got--
a piercing glance?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.453
Face it, white bread.
Buffy's got a type,
and you're not it.

09:14.486 --> 09:16.523
She likes us
dangerous, rough,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.625
occasionally bumpy
in the forehead region.

09:18.658 --> 09:21.461
Not that
she doesn't like you,
but sorry, Charlie,

09:21.494 --> 09:23.363
you're just not
dark enough.

09:23.395 --> 09:26.232
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

09:26.265 --> 09:30.302
Am I dark enough for you now?
Bloody pull me back in, you sod,
I'm starting to sizzle.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.606
You don't know anything about
Buffy. You never did. I'm the
one that knows what she needs.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.375
Oh, yeah? That's why you're
with her at hospital right now,
giving her what she needs.

09:36.408 --> 09:38.278
What are you
talking about?

09:38.311 --> 09:40.147
Don't you know?
Didn't she tell you?

09:40.179 --> 09:43.917
You tell me.
Her mum's sickly.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.052
Buffy took her to hospital
for a bit of prod and probe.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.422
Bite-sized one
went too.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.158
You know, it's funny
her not calling you
about that.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.827
I've known
since last night.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.764
Oh! Blanket! Blanket!

09:56.797 --> 09:59.799
(Sizzling)

09:59.832 --> 10:01.668
(Door slams shut)

10:10.977 --> 10:13.013
(Sighing)

10:16.515 --> 10:19.485
Riley.
Sorry.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.822
I heard.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.124
I thought
maybe you'd need--

10:25.893 --> 10:29.028
I do. I do.
I'm glad.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.463
I just-- I didn't--

10:31.498 --> 10:33.667
I mean until
we knew what it was--

10:33.701 --> 10:36.302
I understand.
How's she doing?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.139
Well, she just
had a CAT scan.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.342
I was about to
go in and find out.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.212
Will you sit with Dawn
while I talk to Mom?

10:46.245 --> 10:48.981
She's in
the waiting room.
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.984
(Exhales deeply)

10:59.058 --> 11:02.629
Hi. May I come in?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.966
Oh, of course, baby,
come on in. Where's Dawn?

11:05.999 --> 11:09.201
Uh, she's with Riley.
They're watching TV
in the waiting room.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.538
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna check on
the status of the OR

11:14.206 --> 11:16.809
The OR?

11:16.844 --> 11:21.313
Dr. Isaacs says I'm lucky
there's one available
on such short notice.

11:21.347 --> 11:26.219
Some people wait for days,
sometimes weeks.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.020
Mom,
what did they find?

11:29.722 --> 11:32.158
A shadow.

11:32.192 --> 11:36.428
I've got a shadow...
Somewhere over there.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.664
He showed it to me,
but, um,

11:38.697 --> 11:42.068
they have to do a biopsy
to find out exactly what it is.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.378
The doctor says it's
too early to be concerned.

11:52.578 --> 11:56.850
Right.
No concern.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.918
Right, just a shadow.

12:04.456 --> 12:06.894
WILLOW:
I just wish we knew
what we were dealing with.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.961
It feels like we're
going around in circles.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.130
Our circles are
going around in circles.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.100
We've got
dizzy circles here, Giles.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.634
Ah, weeping Buddha.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.604
Shoulders your
spiritual burden.

12:17.636 --> 12:19.773
Makes a lovely
paperweight too.

12:19.807 --> 12:23.543
-Maybe she's not in the books.
-WILLOW: what do you mean?

12:23.576 --> 12:27.147
I mean, what if she's not
a demon or a sorceress...

12:27.179 --> 12:29.982
or a spirit or whatever
these books cover?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.484
(Cash register dings)

12:31.518 --> 12:34.453
What if she's something
else altogether?

12:34.486 --> 12:37.256
Thank you, come again.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.793
Something new, you mean?

12:39.826 --> 12:42.929
Something old.

12:42.962 --> 12:45.264
So old it predates
the written word.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.767
Giles,
the Dagon Sphere--

12:47.801 --> 12:49.735
You said that was
created to repel--

12:49.769 --> 12:53.340
That which
cannot be named.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.509
So, I'm thinking
maybe she--

12:56.543 --> 12:58.677
Predates
language itself?

13:01.780 --> 13:04.350
Hey, if it means I don't
have to read anymore, whoo.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.519
And might I add a big hoo.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.788
If Tara's right,
then we're blind.
There's--

13:09.822 --> 13:13.759
There's no way we can
determine her moves,
her habits,

13:13.793 --> 13:16.028
where
she'll turn up nex--

13:16.062 --> 13:20.466
Oh, I beg your--
uh-huh.
I want these.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.036
Yes, of course.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.971
Did you find everything
all right?

13:25.004 --> 13:28.107
No problemo.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.177
That's, um-- oh.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.313
(Cash register dings)

13:34.346 --> 13:37.250
Your receipt.
And...

13:39.485 --> 13:41.721
Thank you.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.693
She could be anywhere.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.996
But if she's as powerful
as Buffy says,

13:50.029 --> 13:52.698
I imagine it won't be long
before she makes herself known.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.886
Everything went fine.
They're moving her
into recovery now.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.523
Do we have
the results yet?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.525
Let's, uh, sit down
over here for a minute.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.628
No.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.365
Excuse me, no.
I-- I don't mean
to be rude.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.399
It's just I have
been sitting
for hours.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.735
I don't want to sit.
I just-- tell me, please.

15:05.772 --> 15:11.410
Your mother has--
the term is low-grade glioma.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.580
It's a brain tumor.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.115
The clinical name
is oligodendroglioma.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.219
It's in the left hemisphere
of the cerebrum.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.554
In your mother's case,
the tumor seems to
have started there.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.724
In other words,
it hasn't spread from
another part of the body...

15:24.756 --> 15:28.427
(Doctor's voice fades)

15:32.764 --> 15:35.668
I know
this is very difficult,

15:35.701 --> 15:39.605
and, uh, because of the nature
of your mother's illness,

15:39.639 --> 15:42.774
unfortunately,
things may progress
very quickly.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.144
Things?
What things?

15:45.177 --> 15:49.182
Symptoms.
There's a fair variety
that might present--

15:49.216 --> 15:52.251
Loss of vision or appetite,

15:52.284 --> 15:54.453
lack of muscle control,

15:54.486 --> 15:56.456
uh, mood swings.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.790
But what can we do?

15:58.825 --> 16:03.429
Well, not much
until we determine
if the tumor's operable,

16:03.462 --> 16:07.200
which we are working on.

16:07.234 --> 16:13.039
Uh, is there something
that I-- I mean--
can I help?

16:13.072 --> 16:15.674
Well, there's some literature
you might want to look at.

16:15.707 --> 16:18.544
If we aren't able
to go in surgically,

16:18.577 --> 16:21.780
there are
a number of new treatments
that are very promising.

16:21.813 --> 16:25.184
Your mother's prognosis
is a lot better today...

16:25.217 --> 16:27.153
than it would've been
only a year ago.

16:27.187 --> 16:31.791
Even if
the tumor's not operable,
she has a real chance.

16:31.823 --> 16:34.061
What's a real chance?

16:34.094 --> 16:39.631
Nearly one out of three
patients with this condition
does just fine.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.870
Now, let me ask,
does your mother's
insurance company...

16:43.903 --> 16:47.506
require copies of the MRI
and pathology reports?

16:47.539 --> 16:51.477
I'm not sure.
Well, just let me know
as soon as possible.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.914
And I could use some information
regarding your mom's lifestyle
and home environment.

16:55.947 --> 16:58.250
For instance,
does she use a cell phone?

16:58.284 --> 17:01.587
Uh, I think so.
Uh, yeah.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.522
She, um, she has one
of those ear things.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.593
Okay. Is your house
near any power lines,

17:06.625 --> 17:10.563
chemical plants,
waste disposal facilities?

17:10.596 --> 17:12.765
Uh, I don't know.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.866
Maybe.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.505
Well, the more we know--

17:18.538 --> 17:20.472
I'm sorry.

17:23.375 --> 17:27.247
Excuse me, Doc,
but they told me
you're needed in ICU

17:27.279 --> 17:29.449
Excuse me, Miss Summers.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.250
It's... Okay.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.891
Thought you looked like
you needed a break.

17:38.924 --> 17:41.461
Guy's great,
but he doesn't have
that bone in his head...

17:41.493 --> 17:43.895
that tells him
when to back off.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.200
You-- I mean,
they didn't need him?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.969
Well, I'm sure
someone does somewhere.
They always do.

17:50.001 --> 17:52.439
He really is a good doctor.
Your mom's in good hands.

17:53.772 --> 17:57.410
Thank you.
It's Ben, right?
Right.

17:59.979 --> 18:04.151
He, um-- he was just telling me
that there's nothing I can do.

18:04.183 --> 18:09.989
And I'm gonna
tell you the same thing.
Give yourself a break.

18:10.021 --> 18:13.425
Listen, your mom's gonna
be unconscious for at least
another six, seven hours.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.762
A break?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.964
I just mean go out.
Get some air.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.967
Come back later on
this evening,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.102
talk to the doc
then if you want.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.938
My unsolicited
advice of the day.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.445
(Exhales deeply)

18:34.780 --> 18:36.816
Buffy.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.289
It's bad.
I know.

18:45.525 --> 18:49.162
I, uh-- I have to
do something.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.097
Do something?
Yeah, like,
you know, magic--

18:52.131 --> 18:53.799
Like
a healing spell.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.868
Buffy, people get sick.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.471
I don't think magic--
That attitude's
not helping.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.711
I have to try.

19:05.744 --> 19:08.047
Okay.

19:08.079 --> 19:10.182
I need to talk to Giles.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.719
Will you do me a favor
and drop Dawn off at school...

19:12.751 --> 19:15.488
and tell her I'll meet her
at the magic shop
when she gets off?

19:15.521 --> 19:17.390
Of course.
Whatever you need me to do.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.729
Buffy,

19:22.761 --> 19:25.897
what do you want me
to tell Dawn...
About your mom?

19:33.740 --> 19:35.442
Tell her we don't know
anything yet.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.526
Hey.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.595
Hey!

19:57.463 --> 19:59.766
Hey! Hey!

20:01.233 --> 20:03.769
Anya, your "heys" are
startling the customers.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.938
And pretty much
the state.

20:05.971 --> 20:09.276
You sold someone a Kohl's amulet
and a Sobekian bloodstone.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.278
Yes, I believe I did.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.145
Are you stupid
or something?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.784
Allow me to answer
that question with a firing.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.019
She's kidding.

20:20.051 --> 20:23.789
An, we talked about
the employee/employer
vocabulary no-nos.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.259
That was number five.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.127
You never sell these things
together, ever. Bad news.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.798
Don't you know
about the Sobekites?

20:31.830 --> 20:36.969
Oh, I do. It was
an ancient Egyptian cult
heavy into dark magic.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.538
And the Kohl's amulet--

20:38.570 --> 20:40.406
Wasn't that
a transmogrification conduit?

20:40.440 --> 20:44.411
Damn straight.
Be that as it may, I still
see no reason for concern.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.980
The Sobekian
transmogrification spells were
lost thousands of years ago.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.317
And besides, the young woman
to whom I sold them...

20:50.349 --> 20:52.652
would have to have
enormous power--

20:52.684 --> 20:54.921
Young woman?

20:54.953 --> 20:57.123
Oh, dear lord.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.728
What?

21:01.760 --> 21:03.762
(Calliope playing)

21:11.770 --> 21:14.340
You're melting.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.477
Oh, um, guess
I'm not hungry.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.281
Maybe I'm not
making this any better.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.518
No. I just--

21:26.719 --> 21:29.821
This is better.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.996
I had my 10th
birthday party here.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.366
Really?
Mm-hmm.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.336
We'd just moved
to Sunnydale and...

21:44.371 --> 21:46.772
Mom rented the carousel
for an entire hour...

21:46.806 --> 21:48.641
for just me
and my friends.

21:50.175 --> 21:52.278
Except I hadn't made
any friends yet,

21:52.310 --> 21:56.715
so it was just
me and Mom and Buffy
riding it by ourselves,

21:56.749 --> 21:58.951
over and over
and over again...

21:58.984 --> 22:02.320
for the whole hour,

22:02.355 --> 22:04.656
just so Mom felt
like we'd gotten
our money's worth.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.796
She's--

22:09.828 --> 22:11.663
She's not gonna
get better, is she?

22:13.865 --> 22:16.001
Absolutely she will.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.871
You Summers women are tough.

22:22.741 --> 22:24.644
I'm really glad
you're here.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.578
Thanks.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.717
Buffy's glad too.

22:32.451 --> 22:35.320
Yeah?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.223
She sure cries
a lot less with you
than she did with Angel.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.894
Angel made her
cry a lot, huh?

22:42.929 --> 22:46.332
Everything with him was
all "eeeee," you know?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.567
All?

22:48.601 --> 22:53.573
You know, "my boyfriend's
a vampire crazy, crazy."

22:53.605 --> 22:56.742
Every day was like
the end of the world.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.645
She doesn't
get all worked up
like that over you.

23:05.116 --> 23:07.252
I think you've been
really good for her.

23:12.825 --> 23:16.127
So I figure there
has to be some kind
of mystical cure, right?

23:16.162 --> 23:19.065
I mean, like a potion
or a spell or something.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.634
We have to look.
We can look.

23:21.667 --> 23:25.203
I mean, we will,
but I haven't seen anything.

23:25.237 --> 23:29.576
The truth is, uh,
the mystical
and the medical...

23:29.608 --> 23:31.978
aren't meant to mix,
Buffy.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.546
Sorry.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.483
The human mind
is very delicate.
Just too much could go wrong.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.987
Yeah, I've heard
stories about people
trying healing spells.

23:41.019 --> 23:43.623
If we did something,
it could make things
a lot worse, Buffy.

23:43.655 --> 23:47.960
We've done just about
enough making things worse
for one day, haven't we?

23:47.993 --> 23:50.997
Why? What do you mean?

23:51.029 --> 23:55.101
Nothing. Anya broke
a bippity-boppity-boo.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.302
A thing.
Don't worry about it.

23:57.336 --> 24:00.138
I did not.
I didn't break--
Anya...

24:00.172 --> 24:03.241
Buffy doesn't need
to hear about your, uh,
clumsiness right now.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.145
My clumsiness.
I mean, that is so...

24:10.950 --> 24:13.019
like... me.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.086
Slippery, slippery.
Butterfingers.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.256
-What happened?
-Nothing to concern you.

24:17.288 --> 24:20.026
Giles.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.998
The, uh, demon woman was here.
The one who attacked you.

24:26.031 --> 24:30.769
It's no biggie.
She just got an amulet
and a bloodstone.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.440
-ANYA:
That can create a monster
-Okay, biggie.

24:34.472 --> 24:37.009
My god, are you guys okay,
though? No one got hurt, right?

24:37.042 --> 24:39.846
No, no. Thankfully,
no violence to speak of.

24:39.878 --> 24:43.348
Okay, so that's... good.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.586
How did she get away
with this bad mojo stuff?

24:50.155 --> 24:52.258
(Whispering)
Giles sold it to her.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.228
I-- I-- I didn't know
it was her.

24:56.261 --> 24:59.198
I mean, how could I?

24:59.230 --> 25:01.567
If it's any consolation,
I may have overcharged her.

25:01.601 --> 25:05.171
And Anya figured out
what the demon lady's up to.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.205
Yeah. A few
thousand years ago,
there was this cult--

25:07.239 --> 25:09.208
The Temple of Sobek.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.679
-Sobek?
-Reptile demon.

25:12.711 --> 25:15.682
Sobekites were
reptile worshipers.

25:15.714 --> 25:20.086
Just once I would like
to run into a cult
of bunny worshipers.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.488
Great.
Thank you very much
for those nightmares.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.891
Sorry.

25:24.923 --> 25:29.862
Anyway,
their high priest, Kohl,
had great mystic powers.

25:29.895 --> 25:33.566
He forged an amulet with
a transmogrifying crystal.

25:33.599 --> 25:37.368
Transmogrifying
is changing a living thing...

25:37.403 --> 25:39.404
into a different kind
of thing.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.773
We've managed to
decipher the markings...

25:41.807 --> 25:45.176
that were on the bloodstone that
I sold-- that she left with.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.547
A cobra. She's going to
transmogrify a cobra.

25:48.580 --> 25:52.018
Okay, so she's making a monster.
What for? What does it do?

25:52.050 --> 25:55.421
That's the part--
(clears throat)
We're working on it.

25:55.453 --> 25:59.458
Well, you keep working on it.
I'll go kill it.

25:59.490 --> 26:02.028
-Buffy?
-What? I'm going.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.895
Buffy, this chick
creamed you last time.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.531
That's because I wasn't
ready for her last time.
I am now.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.299
But you--
But what?

26:08.334 --> 26:11.804
Wil, I can't just sit here.
I have to do something.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.143
(Bell rings, door closes)

26:17.175 --> 26:19.010
(Lion roaring,
birds warbling)

26:21.279 --> 26:23.148
(Footsteps approaching)

26:30.823 --> 26:32.759
(Hisses)

26:36.828 --> 26:39.164
Chill, worm.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.500
I'm gonna make you a star.

26:55.381 --> 26:59.685
Chant.
(Chanting in ancient language)

27:03.288 --> 27:05.991
Sobek,
grant the power,

27:06.025 --> 27:08.359
that it may mold
this wretched creature.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.830
That it may be reborn,
that it may serve.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.432
Ah! Dark incantations.

27:14.465 --> 27:18.304
Always overwritten.
Why can't they just
cut to the--

27:18.336 --> 27:21.606
Fight?
Ooh. No fair...

27:21.640 --> 27:26.545
Attacking... when I wasn't
even looking. Ooh. Help.

27:28.748 --> 27:33.285
No. This is no good.
I'm out of the moment.

27:33.318 --> 27:36.454
And you're not giving me
anything I can use.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.192
Dreg, I'm not
hearing chanting!
Continue!

27:40.226 --> 27:43.194
Yes, Glory.
(Chanting resumes)

27:43.229 --> 27:46.699
Hey, hey,
work with me here.

27:46.732 --> 27:49.801
(Continues
chanting)

27:49.836 --> 27:53.905
There, that feels more real.
Don't you think?

27:55.507 --> 27:58.845
(Groans)
Oh, no.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.915
Even if I do have to carry
your performance.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.252
Scene.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.589
(Chanting)

28:11.623 --> 28:15.227
Arise. Arise!

28:15.260 --> 28:18.230
(Chanting)

28:18.263 --> 28:20.098
Arise!

28:22.734 --> 28:24.603
(Screeching)

28:31.210 --> 28:33.444
He is arisen.

28:33.479 --> 28:36.382
'Bout damn time.

28:42.653 --> 28:45.023
(Groans)

28:45.057 --> 28:47.726
Spawn of Sobek.

28:52.964 --> 28:56.234
The power is yours
to see what is unseen,

28:56.268 --> 28:58.569
to find what is
shrouded in shadow.

28:58.604 --> 29:01.272
Already you know
what I seek.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.810
I have given you form.
Now find for me the key.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.546
Seek it out
in the holy places.
(Hisses)

29:07.578 --> 29:11.482
Yes, yes, yes.
Let your vision guide you
to its hiding place...

29:11.517 --> 29:14.185
and then return to me
and tell me where it lies.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.127
Now would be good.

29:25.696 --> 29:27.732
Fun, fun, fun.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.001
Aleister Crowley sings?

29:30.036 --> 29:32.137
Sadly, no,
I don't carry that,

29:32.171 --> 29:35.141
but I do have some
very nice whale sounds.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.875
Oh, excuse me
for a moment.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.080
-Where's Buffy?
-Uh, she left a while ago.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.183
What?
Where?

29:45.217 --> 29:49.020
That creepy demon woman's
conjuring some kind of monster.

29:49.055 --> 29:52.191
And you let Buffy
go after her? Alone?

29:52.223 --> 29:57.563
"Let" isn't really a factor
when she sets her mind
to something. You know that.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.701
She'll get herself killed.
It's crazy.

30:02.733 --> 30:06.372
Yeah, crazy.
Going off alone,
half-cocked,

30:06.404 --> 30:08.339
instead of waiting
for much-needed backup.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.209
Charging in with
a big old hand grenade.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.278
Oh, wait.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.212
This is different.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.815
Yeah, it is.

30:16.848 --> 30:20.952
Buffy needs
something she can fight,
something she can solve.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.154
I don't know
what kind of action
you're looking for.

30:24.589 --> 30:26.525
Do you?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.827
Hey, I'm not
trying to get--
it's cool.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.165
You okay?

30:36.102 --> 30:38.503
Just a little crazed.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.572
I hear ya.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.608
If, uh,
she needs me--

30:55.922 --> 30:58.789
(Hissing)

31:09.201 --> 31:13.105
(Telephone rings)

31:13.138 --> 31:16.607
Magic Box, your one-stop
spot to shop for--
Giles, it's me.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.844
Buffy.
Are you all right?

31:18.876 --> 31:23.249
No, I'm really not.
(Sighs)
I couldn't stop her.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.284
I couldn't even
slow her down.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.318
-Where are you?
-Sunnydale Memorial.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.289
Are you badly hurt?
I'll come right over.

31:31.323 --> 31:36.528
No. No. I just wanted to
warn you that that thing
she conjured-- it's loose.

31:36.561 --> 31:40.731
It's a big snake thing.
Not Mayor big, but it's
pretty lethal looking.

31:40.766 --> 31:44.202
-Do you know why she raised it?
-I don't know yet.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.637
I'll warn the others.
We'll get weapons.
We'll fan out--

31:46.672 --> 31:48.874
Wait, wait a second.
What time is it?

31:48.906 --> 31:51.210
Half past 4:00.
Why?

31:51.242 --> 31:54.246
School's out.
Dawn's on her way
over to you. Giles--

31:54.279 --> 31:57.615
Understood.
We'll keep her safe here
until you arrive.

31:57.648 --> 32:00.486
Thanks.
And, Giles--
Yes?

32:02.288 --> 32:05.923
Dawn's kind of fragile
right now... about mom.

32:05.958 --> 32:10.096
She doesn't know
how bad it is.
We'll not say a word.

32:10.128 --> 32:12.663
Well, my mom's gonna
wake up soon,

32:12.698 --> 32:16.001
and I should be there
when the doctors tell her.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.336
She's in good hands,
Buffy.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.939
There's really
nothing else you can do.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.474
Okay. Bye.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.510
Bye.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.515
(Sniffles)

34:28.300 --> 34:31.503
(Hissing)

34:49.820 --> 34:51.657
(Bell jingles)

35:01.266 --> 35:03.668
(Bell jingles)

35:20.286 --> 35:22.554
Is she awake yet?

35:23.989 --> 35:26.324
Yeah.
She's waiting for us.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.561
Can we take her home now?

35:33.164 --> 35:37.735
We'll see.
Go get your stuff.

35:49.547 --> 35:54.320
-So, any monster
reptile sightings?
-None.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.855
Tara and I did
a mini-patrol earlier,

35:56.887 --> 35:58.956
but the biggie snake
was nowhere to be--

35:58.989 --> 36:01.159
(Growling)

36:02.494 --> 36:05.396
(Screeching)

36:07.599 --> 36:11.302
(Screaming)

36:11.336 --> 36:13.871
-(Hissing continues)
-(screaming continues)

36:13.905 --> 36:15.840
-(Roars)
-(screaming continues)

36:27.619 --> 36:29.920
Dawn, you okay?

36:29.954 --> 36:31.989
Why was the big snake
afraid of Dawn?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.759
It knows.

36:37.228 --> 36:40.266
(Hissing)

36:42.967 --> 36:45.704
(Tires screeching)

36:59.751 --> 37:01.487
(Tires squealing)

37:20.672 --> 37:22.974
I've got to stop this monster
before it gets back to Glory.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.242
Glory?
That's what he called her.

37:25.277 --> 37:28.012
Giles, she's gonna know
Dawn's the key if we don't--
We will!

37:31.282 --> 37:33.985
DREG:
Please! Please, Mistress!

37:34.018 --> 37:38.255
Perturbed, yet ultimately
merciful, one, please, no!

37:38.289 --> 37:40.291
What is taking
so long, Dreg?

37:40.326 --> 37:43.429
You told me snakey-wakey
would find my key.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.931
Now, why isn't he back here
with a beautiful message
for me?

37:45.963 --> 37:48.065
I grovel like a bug,

37:48.099 --> 37:51.436
most silky
and effervescent Glorificus.

37:51.469 --> 37:55.507
Glory. Glory,
your most fresh and cleanness,

37:55.541 --> 37:57.509
it's just a matter of time.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.945
Oh, everything
takes time!

37:59.978 --> 38:02.447
What about my time?

38:02.481 --> 38:05.684
Does anyone appreciate that
I'm on a schedule here?

38:05.717 --> 38:09.688
Tick-tock, Dreg.
Tick-fricking-tock!

38:27.539 --> 38:29.407
(Tires screech)

38:37.014 --> 38:38.849
(Tires squeal)

38:40.085 --> 38:43.221
(Hissing)

38:56.434 --> 38:58.503
(Roars)

39:08.112 --> 39:10.215
(Gasping)
(grunts)

39:21.760 --> 39:23.795
(Gasping stops)

39:31.902 --> 39:34.405
(Hisses)

39:34.440 --> 39:36.306
(Roars)

39:43.213 --> 39:46.317
(Grunting)

39:55.494 --> 39:58.163
(Grunting continues)

40:02.568 --> 40:05.436
(Grunting continues)

40:25.523 --> 40:27.492
You want me to stay?

40:27.525 --> 40:30.427
No. I'm fine.

40:30.461 --> 40:34.164
I think I should
talk to Dawn alone.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.835
Okay.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.572
Oh, do I have bed hair?

40:40.606 --> 40:42.940
I don't look like
scary mom, do I?

40:42.974 --> 40:46.010
No. You look beautiful.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.789
Okay. Let's do this.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.628
Stay close.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.731
I will.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.090
RILEY:
Buffy.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.768
You okay?
You look pretty beat up.

41:48.539 --> 41:51.342
Minimal damage
of the fighting kind.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.744
It's all the other kind.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.414
Come here.
(Sighs)

41:59.083 --> 42:02.519
It's okay.
Just let it out.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.521
I'm right here.

42:07.092 --> 42:10.427
(Sighs, sniffles)
I can't.

42:10.460 --> 42:13.231
Not now.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.132
They need me.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.036
If I start now,

42:19.070 --> 42:20.871
I won't be able to stop.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.244
JOYCE: Buffy.

42:53.503 --> 42:55.907
(theme music plays)

43:23.601 --> 43:25.936
Grr! Arrgh!
