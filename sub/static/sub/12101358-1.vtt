00:20.837 --> 00:22.763
James, hey, wake up.

00:22.915 --> 00:25.024
Honey, honey, I think
there's someone in the house.

01:05.808 --> 01:08.734
James! James, wake up!
James, wake up!

01:08.811 --> 01:12.071
Wake up, James!
There's somebody down here!

01:12.147 --> 01:14.055
Help! Help!

01:14.075 --> 01:16.224
Somebody help me!

01:16.243 --> 01:17.743
Please! Please!

01:40.417 --> 01:44.770
Mm! Morning.

01:46.665 --> 01:49.090
Morning, wife.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.168
I didn't know you were up.

01:51.186 --> 01:53.428
"Wife."
I didn't think I was the...

01:53.447 --> 01:56.448
"Hey, we're in Vegas,
let's get hitched" kind of girl.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.100
Yeah? Well, here we are.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
Hmm. Damn right.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.275
I got you something.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.919
You did?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.132
It's just a little
post-wedding gift,

02:13.283 --> 02:15.801
a small token my love.

02:17.529 --> 02:18.804
Babe...

02:18.955 --> 02:20.864
I didn't get you anything.

02:20.883 --> 02:22.975
You give me everything.

02:26.555 --> 02:27.813
Go ahead, open it.

02:37.974 --> 02:38.949
Wow.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.955
You said you had a watch like it
in your twenties that you lost.

02:46.058 --> 02:48.500
Yeah. I just...

02:48.652 --> 02:52.588
I can't believe that you
remembered that story, babe.

02:54.082 --> 02:55.732
Thank you.

02:55.751 --> 02:57.134
You're welcome.

03:00.255 --> 03:02.088
Wow.

03:02.241 --> 03:05.759
Uh, so...

03:05.911 --> 03:08.578
is Mara cool with this?

03:08.597 --> 03:10.856
With us, you know,
getting married now?

03:11.007 --> 03:12.749
I-I think so.

03:12.751 --> 03:14.526
We're gonna have to do something
more formal with her

03:14.678 --> 03:15.861
sometime soon, but...

03:15.938 --> 03:17.345
Absolutely.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.423
And my mom is gonna
move in with us,

03:19.425 --> 03:22.517
so, you know, we can all
celebrate our love together.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.370
Oh, I like the sound of that.

03:27.023 --> 03:28.540
What time's our flight?

03:28.617 --> 03:31.601
It's at noon,
so I'll go pick her up and...

03:31.620 --> 03:33.528
Really, I can't
thank you guys enough

03:33.547 --> 03:35.380
for letting her stay with us.

03:35.457 --> 03:37.883
It means a lot.
I just moved in,

03:38.034 --> 03:41.445
and now you got
two of us to deal with.

03:41.447 --> 03:42.629
We're family.

03:42.781 --> 03:45.057
I guess it was
a little bit weird

03:45.208 --> 03:46.558
that you and I tied the knot,

03:46.710 --> 03:48.952
and I haven't even
met your mom, but...

03:48.971 --> 03:51.396
Yeah, she's just--

03:51.548 --> 03:53.957
Maggie's been too sick
to travel lately.

03:53.976 --> 03:59.905
I'm telling you, Kristen,
diabetes can be a real bitch.

04:00.983 --> 04:02.574
I should warn you,

04:02.651 --> 04:05.244
I can kinda
make her one too.

04:05.395 --> 04:08.747
Well, I'm sure
I can handle her.

04:08.898 --> 04:12.709
I mean, I know I can
handle you.

04:24.339 --> 04:26.598
Your form is so good.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.017
Hi.

04:31.421 --> 04:32.771
Look, I don't mean
to ruin your workout.

04:32.922 --> 04:34.998
I just want
to check in on you.

04:35.017 --> 04:38.518
Oh, no, it's no worries.
I was just about done.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.670
Hey, I didn't see James
this morning? Where is he?

04:40.672 --> 04:43.282
He's picking his mother up
at the airport, remember?

04:43.358 --> 04:45.951
Oh, yeah, that's today.

04:46.102 --> 04:49.179
You two have been a couple
for like, what, six months now?

04:49.197 --> 04:52.198
I cannot believe you
haven't even met his mom.

04:52.351 --> 04:54.960
Well, I think that this way,

04:55.111 --> 04:57.963
isn't it awesome
we get to meet her together?

04:58.114 --> 05:00.114
Yeah, sure, why not?

05:00.134 --> 05:04.861
Honey, I know I've asked you
this a bunch of times, but you--

05:04.863 --> 05:06.863
You're not upset, right?

05:06.882 --> 05:09.032
I mean, about us running off
to get married?

05:09.034 --> 05:11.977
No, no. I just--

05:12.128 --> 05:14.813
I think that maybe
it feels a little...

05:16.542 --> 05:18.150
Soon?

05:18.226 --> 05:21.227
I usually reserve that term
for bad jokes about tragedy,

05:21.380 --> 05:23.655
but yeah, maybe a little.

05:25.809 --> 05:28.051
But you like him though,
right?

05:28.053 --> 05:31.237
James? Oh, yeah, I really do.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.557
I see the way
that he treats you.

05:33.575 --> 05:37.336
It's very sweet,
and I think that you deserve it.

05:37.487 --> 05:42.232
But like you said, it just--
It happened so fast,

05:42.250 --> 05:44.676
and I feel like you're still
pretty vulnerable

05:44.828 --> 05:46.845
after everything that happened
last year.

05:48.907 --> 05:49.848
Maybe.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.762
Honey, I'm an adult,
and I know what's right for me.

05:55.914 --> 06:01.084
I'm so much better
than a year ago.

06:01.103 --> 06:02.586
You know?

06:02.604 --> 06:06.990
You and James
are a big part of why.

06:08.594 --> 06:11.018
Heck, you know,
between my loving daughter

06:11.038 --> 06:12.929
and my new husband and shrink,

06:12.948 --> 06:14.598
I'm pretty much
as good as new.

06:14.616 --> 06:16.541
I know how terrible it all was,

06:16.693 --> 06:20.120
but honestly, Mom,
think about it like this.

06:20.272 --> 06:22.964
How many people really get stuck
twice in their lifetime?

06:25.277 --> 06:26.793
I have no idea,

06:26.945 --> 06:30.055
but if there's one,
that's one too many.

06:47.724 --> 06:51.151
Mom, I would like
for you to meet

06:51.303 --> 06:53.987
my gorgeous
and generous wife, Kristen,

06:54.139 --> 06:56.581
and her awesome and equally
generous daughter, Mara.

06:56.658 --> 06:59.751
This is my mom, Maggie.

06:59.903 --> 07:02.479
It's so nice
to finally meet you, Maggie.

07:02.497 --> 07:04.756
Welcome to our home.

07:04.833 --> 07:07.500
Yeah. Our casa is your casa.

07:07.653 --> 07:09.744
Mm.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.747
Mom, would you like to say
something to your host?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.157
Where's my room?

07:14.159 --> 07:17.994
Mom, come on, be nice.

07:18.013 --> 07:22.682
Thank you for allowing me
to stay with my boy.

07:22.834 --> 07:26.186
Uh, you're welcome.
We're happy to have you.

07:26.338 --> 07:28.262
Yeah, we are happy
to have you, Mom.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.949
- Let's sit down.
- Isn't that nice?

07:35.864 --> 07:39.032
Well, I'll try not to be
too much trouble.

07:39.184 --> 07:42.127
Oh, I'm sure it'll be
no trouble at all.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.853
Say cheese.

07:43.872 --> 07:45.188
Oh! What are you doing?

07:45.207 --> 07:47.466
Just taking your picture.

07:47.617 --> 07:49.876
- Why?
- Posterity?

07:50.028 --> 07:53.638
I hate having my photo taken.
Put that thing away now!

07:53.715 --> 07:56.366
- It's okay.
- It's okay, Mom, it's okay.

07:56.384 --> 07:58.292
Why don't I go get
some refreshments?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.644
Hey, Mara, would you help me?

07:59.721 --> 08:01.480
- Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.
- Great.

08:01.556 --> 08:04.149
Let's leave these two to get
a little better acquainted.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.984
- Right.
- All right.

08:09.639 --> 08:11.881
So it's--
It's Kristen, right?

08:11.900 --> 08:14.576
That's me.

08:16.571 --> 08:19.331
Well, you got a good-sized
house here, Kristen.

08:19.407 --> 08:21.558
Oh, thanks.

08:21.576 --> 08:26.505
A bit tacky for my taste, but
that's neither here nor there.

08:26.581 --> 08:29.007
Good for you,
living high on that hog.

08:29.084 --> 08:32.344
You get the money from your
first husband or something?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.680
Um, no.

08:35.832 --> 08:41.745
Actually, Mara's father
passed away when she was little.

08:41.747 --> 08:45.248
For the record, I'm the
breadwinner of the family.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.174
Oh, is that right?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.252
What exactly does
the breadwinner do

08:49.271 --> 08:51.530
to make all that dough rise?

08:51.606 --> 08:52.922
I'm a divorce attorney.

08:52.941 --> 08:55.775
Ah! Got it.

08:55.927 --> 08:58.762
So while all those miserable,
desperate people

08:58.780 --> 09:00.855
are suffering right there
in front of you,

09:00.874 --> 09:02.432
you're just sitting there,

09:02.450 --> 09:05.359
billing the hours
and raking in that cash.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.046
I mean, I'm not just
sitting there.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.882
Oh, no, of course not.
I'm just kidding.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.470
So how'd you get my boy
to marry you anyway?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.948
Uh, well, actually, it was...

09:18.967 --> 09:21.059
James was the only one
who suggested

09:21.210 --> 09:23.544
that we do it on the spot.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.623
Was the wedding nice or what?

09:26.641 --> 09:30.235
'cause this mother of the groom
never saw a damn photo.

09:32.388 --> 09:34.722
Here you go.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.993
Now we're family,
all of us.

09:39.562 --> 09:40.728
Isn't that wonderful?

09:40.747 --> 09:44.490
Yeah, I feel the same way.

09:44.643 --> 09:46.251
See? Look at you two.
I knew it.

09:46.402 --> 09:48.837
Couple peas in a pod.

09:52.742 --> 09:54.259
Mom, is everything okay?

09:54.410 --> 09:56.820
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

09:56.822 --> 09:58.555
This is gonna be so much fun.

10:06.348 --> 10:08.756
You wanted to see me?
What's up?

10:08.775 --> 10:10.350
- Come here.
- Yeah?

10:10.502 --> 10:12.168
I just...

10:12.170 --> 10:13.945
What's going on?

10:15.765 --> 10:18.007
Kristen, just say it.

10:18.026 --> 10:20.510
Did your mother
say anything to you about me?

10:20.528 --> 10:26.291
Just that she was thankful that
you opened up your home to her.

10:26.442 --> 10:29.294
Really? She said that?

10:29.445 --> 10:31.371
I get the feeling that she
doesn't like me all that much,

10:31.523 --> 10:33.523
and I have no idea
what I did wrong.

10:33.541 --> 10:34.707
Okay, what happened?

10:34.860 --> 10:36.709
Was it something
in her tone, maybe?

10:36.862 --> 10:38.637
More like something
in her words.

10:38.713 --> 10:40.713
Oh, Kris, I don't know.

10:40.866 --> 10:42.807
She's just
from a different era.

10:42.884 --> 10:45.368
And yeah, I mean, she could be
a little rough around the edges.

10:45.387 --> 10:46.536
You think?

10:46.554 --> 10:49.372
Trust me,
she has a big heart,

10:49.374 --> 10:51.316
and it's usually
in the right place.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.985
She's probably
just testing you,

10:54.137 --> 10:56.154
see what you're made of.

10:56.231 --> 10:59.324
Great. I got enough
on the first day.

10:59.475 --> 11:00.825
Look at me.

11:00.977 --> 11:02.494
Relax, okay?

11:02.645 --> 11:05.238
I love you and Mara.

11:05.390 --> 11:08.725
And yeah,
this happened really fast,

11:08.727 --> 11:11.169
but we have the rest of
our lives to take it easy.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.154
All of us.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.900
So let's just let Maggie get
used to her new surroundings.

11:16.918 --> 11:21.179
I promise.
This is all gonna work out.

11:21.256 --> 11:22.430
Come here.

11:25.927 --> 11:27.352
Thank you.

11:38.681 --> 11:40.532
What are you doing here?

11:40.683 --> 11:43.350
Well, maybe I just wanted to see
that pretty face of yours.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.370
What do you want, Ross?

11:47.432 --> 11:50.375
Your request for child support
is killing me, baby.

11:50.452 --> 11:52.711
Excuse me. "Baby?"

11:52.787 --> 11:54.938
You know I don't have
that much money.

11:54.956 --> 11:57.382
Shrinks make way more money
than private investigators.

11:57.459 --> 11:59.718
It's not my fault. And you know
I hate the word "shrink."

11:59.869 --> 12:02.612
you know, I don't even know
why we're getting divorced.

12:02.630 --> 12:05.298
Because you slept with
your secretary, remember?

12:05.450 --> 12:06.632
Right.

12:06.785 --> 12:08.059
Hi.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.562
Good morning.

12:10.713 --> 12:12.897
Sorry. Did I make a mistake?
Is this not my hour?

12:13.049 --> 12:15.808
No, no. I'm sorry, Kristen,
of course it is.

12:15.961 --> 12:19.154
- I'll call you later.
- I know you will.

12:20.482 --> 12:22.648
Oh, please, come in.

12:22.801 --> 12:23.992
Thanks.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.079
Apologies again, Kristen.

12:28.156 --> 12:30.564
That's my soon-to-be ex,
and he--

12:30.584 --> 12:32.475
Oh, never mind.

12:32.494 --> 12:34.919
I'm sure you hear about this
divorce stuff all day long,

12:34.996 --> 12:38.648
and that is not at all
the reason you're here.

12:38.666 --> 12:40.091
How are you doing?

12:40.243 --> 12:43.669
- I'm, uh, I'm okay.
- You sure?

12:43.822 --> 12:46.489
You seem a little more
undone today than usual.

12:46.491 --> 12:47.657
Did something happen?

12:47.659 --> 12:51.102
- Maggie happened.
- Maggie?

12:51.254 --> 12:53.329
James' mother moved in with us
a couple days ago.

12:53.348 --> 12:58.351
Okay, so you have someone new
living in your house.

12:58.503 --> 12:59.927
She has diabetes,

12:59.946 --> 13:02.005
and she has to use a walker
to get around.

13:02.023 --> 13:04.674
That poor woman.
That's awful.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.451
What's she like?

13:06.528 --> 13:08.102
She doesn't like me,
I can tell you that much.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.862
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

13:10.015 --> 13:12.957
Just the way that
she looks at me, you know.

13:13.109 --> 13:16.461
Just cold, dismissive.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.354
The first time we met,

13:18.373 --> 13:21.524
she said something to me about
my quickie wedding with her boy.

13:21.543 --> 13:23.860
Oh, sounds to me like
she's just a little hurt

13:23.878 --> 13:25.953
that she didn't get to see
you two get married.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.532
Sounded more to me like she was
upset she didn't get to stop it.

13:29.551 --> 13:33.369
Well, mothers-in-laws
and new brides butting heads,

13:33.388 --> 13:35.705
that's not exactly
an uncommon thing.

13:35.723 --> 13:40.043
But how's your mind doing,
otherwise?

13:40.061 --> 13:43.488
I'm, uh, I'm good.

13:43.639 --> 13:46.899
No, I mean, I haven't had any
nightmares the past few months.

13:47.052 --> 13:48.993
Mm-hmm.

13:49.145 --> 13:51.812
I feel like I can, I don't know,
go about my business

13:51.832 --> 13:53.739
without looking
in every direction

13:53.892 --> 13:57.168
for some guy
creeping up behind me and...

13:57.245 --> 13:59.320
I don't know.
I can just...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.673
breathe, I guess.

14:01.824 --> 14:04.825
You know, just...
little things.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.904
Not so little. News flash!

14:07.922 --> 14:11.182
I mean, your stalker actually
made it into your house.

14:11.259 --> 14:12.809
That's terrifying.

14:15.838 --> 14:18.189
I know, I know.
I'm just, um...

14:18.341 --> 14:21.359
I mean, sometimes I feel like
maybe I overreacted.

14:21.436 --> 14:24.028
Your reaction
was perfectly natural.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.255
Lots of people out there
would've experienced

14:26.274 --> 14:29.092
some kind of breakdown
from that.

14:29.094 --> 14:31.327
If you ask me,
you're doing great.

14:34.115 --> 14:35.456
Thanks, Dr. Lewis.

14:37.026 --> 14:39.602
Thanks to you, you know,

14:39.604 --> 14:43.381
and, uh, and my family,
of course.

14:50.131 --> 14:51.781
Actually, none of them's
been around.

14:51.799 --> 14:55.451
Okay, well, gotta be careful.
They might be watching.

14:55.453 --> 14:56.561
[door closes]

14:57.898 --> 15:00.289
- Hey, girlie.
- Hey, what's up, kid?

15:00.308 --> 15:02.216
I'm just waiting for Michael
to come pick me up.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.809
We're gonna go grab
a bite to eat.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.962
And who is this
Michael person?

15:05.980 --> 15:07.405
He's my boo.

15:07.482 --> 15:09.132
Your boo?

15:09.150 --> 15:11.242
Is he a damn ghost
or something?

15:11.394 --> 15:14.078
Mom, she's talking
about her boyfriend,

15:14.230 --> 15:15.747
and I happen to like the kid.

15:15.898 --> 15:17.657
[doorbell rings]

15:17.809 --> 15:19.417
That must be him.

15:19.494 --> 15:23.171
Michael, you can come in.
We're in the living room.

15:25.574 --> 15:26.424
There he is!

15:26.575 --> 15:28.593
Hey, what's up, James?

15:28.670 --> 15:32.430
Well, my spirits, now I got my
lovely mother here in one piece.

15:32.507 --> 15:34.006
Or two.

15:34.159 --> 15:35.992
How's it hanging, kid?
I'm Maggie.

15:36.010 --> 15:40.997
Michael. And it's hanging
just fine, I guess.

15:41.015 --> 15:42.774
Your mom actually allows you
to have boys over

15:42.925 --> 15:44.834
when she's not home?

15:44.852 --> 15:46.502
I'm 19.

15:46.521 --> 15:49.113
Exactly my point.
Like little rabbits at your age.

15:49.265 --> 15:51.950
Bop bop bop bop bop bop!

15:52.026 --> 15:53.843
Oh, my God.

15:53.845 --> 15:55.678
Where is Kristen anyway?

15:55.697 --> 15:57.680
She is at a therapy session.

15:57.682 --> 15:59.031
You gotta be kidding me.

15:59.184 --> 16:02.776
You know what we call therapy
at my age?

16:02.796 --> 16:05.279
Sucking it up
and walking it off.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.023
Uh...

16:07.041 --> 16:12.211
Therapy. It's like a weak sauce
on a feeble sandwich.

16:12.363 --> 16:15.640
That's a little harsh.
I don't think it's weird for her

16:15.791 --> 16:17.642
to get help after everything
she's been through.

16:17.793 --> 16:21.721
Oh? And what happened?

16:21.873 --> 16:24.874
You know what? I'm starving.
Should we go?

16:24.892 --> 16:26.317
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

16:26.469 --> 16:30.321
Hey, Michael, come here.
Got something to tell you.

16:31.399 --> 16:32.949
Um...

16:35.737 --> 16:37.328
Yeah, what's up?

16:37.480 --> 16:39.747
You gotta lean in
if I'm gonna tell you.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.333
Boo!

16:42.410 --> 16:45.319
- Mom...
- [laughs]

16:45.338 --> 16:47.580
You're a strange one, Maggie.

16:47.732 --> 16:50.842
Yeah. Always have been,
always will be.

16:50.918 --> 16:52.343
Hey, come on, Michael.
Let's go.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.995
See ya.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.514
You two have fun.

16:58.593 --> 17:00.743
Bring me back some cheesecake!

17:00.745 --> 17:01.853
[door closes]

17:04.432 --> 17:08.842
So Maggie, she's a real
kick in the ass, huh?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.695
Yeah, she is.

17:10.772 --> 17:12.755
She's gonna need
to stop kicking at my mom,

17:12.757 --> 17:14.866
or we're gonna have a problem.

17:14.942 --> 17:17.869
How's your mom been holding up
with the new houseguest anyways?

17:17.945 --> 17:20.263
She's struggling.
And I can tell too.

17:20.281 --> 17:22.765
And she was doing so well
after everything that happened.

17:22.784 --> 17:25.117
The last thing she needs is
this lady picking at her,

17:25.270 --> 17:26.693
making her crazy.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.837
Yeah.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.726
- [car door closes]
- [alarm chirps]

17:48.568 --> 17:49.650
[clatter]

17:51.404 --> 17:52.528
[Kristen gasps]

17:55.558 --> 17:57.241
Whoa! What's that face?

17:57.393 --> 17:58.968
I just barely avoided getting
attacked in the parking lot.

17:58.970 --> 18:01.079
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

18:01.155 --> 18:03.081
Steve, do me a favor.
Call building management.

18:03.232 --> 18:05.232
They need to get on their game
and up security around here.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.733
That is unacceptable!

18:06.753 --> 18:09.145
Wow. You were really
almost just attacked?

18:09.163 --> 18:13.591
I mean, I definitely saw
someone following me.

18:13.668 --> 18:16.594
You mean towards the entrance
to the building?

18:17.913 --> 18:20.264
Well, y-yeah.

18:20.341 --> 18:22.266
Well, how close
did the guy get to you?

18:22.343 --> 18:24.827
Was he like,
like a car length?

18:24.846 --> 18:26.345
No, no, not that close.

18:26.497 --> 18:29.273
As soon as I turned around,
he took off.

18:29.425 --> 18:35.171
But that could have been for
any number of reasons, right?

18:35.189 --> 18:39.117
Yeah. You're, uh...
You're making valid points.

18:39.268 --> 18:42.537
Well, you still want me
to make that call?

18:44.106 --> 18:45.540
Yes.

18:54.359 --> 18:55.800
[phone ringing]

18:59.030 --> 19:00.304
This is Kristen.

19:00.381 --> 19:03.123

19:03.143 --> 19:04.267

Stop calling me!

<i> JAMES: Wow!</i>
<i> Well, hello to you too.</i>

19:46.502 --> 19:48.244
Hi, James.

19:48.262 --> 19:50.521
Is, uh, is everything okay?

19:50.598 --> 19:51.838
<i> Yeah, yeah, I just...</i>

19:51.858 --> 19:54.417
I kept getting
this unknown number,

19:54.435 --> 19:57.695
and then when I answered,
no one was there and...

19:57.772 --> 20:01.607
you know what? Never mind.
Everything's fine.

20:01.759 --> 20:05.428
<i> Good. Well, Mara is</i>
<i> out to dinner with Michael,</i>

20:05.446 --> 20:07.763
I am done returning
my client calls for the day,

20:07.765 --> 20:09.782
and it's just Mom and I here.

20:09.934 --> 20:11.709
We were wondering
when you'd be coming home.

20:11.786 --> 20:13.269
I think she misses you already.

20:13.287 --> 20:16.272
Um, soon.

20:16.274 --> 20:18.607
Good. See you soon. Bye.

20:18.626 --> 20:20.051
Okay, bye.

20:37.812 --> 20:39.237
You can't be serious.

20:39.388 --> 20:41.054
It's not gonna be
for long, okay?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.965
Just a few months, max.

20:42.984 --> 20:45.243
A few months? Mara,
I'm talking to two realtors

20:45.319 --> 20:48.228
who are looking for apartments
for us right now in L.A.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.639
Well, Michael, I don't know
what you want me to say, okay?

20:50.658 --> 20:53.084
I can't just leave her alone
right now.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.752
She's a grown woman who--

20:54.829 --> 20:56.328
Got the daylights
scared out of her

20:56.481 --> 20:58.664
by some maniac
at her spin class?

20:58.816 --> 21:01.509
Yeah, like a year ago.

21:05.323 --> 21:08.157
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm sure it was a bad time.

21:08.175 --> 21:10.493
You have no idea, okay?

21:10.511 --> 21:13.754
She was getting constant
phone calls every single day.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.832
This psychopath was leaving
these very disturbing messages,

21:16.851 --> 21:18.834
talking about
how they were soulmates

21:18.853 --> 21:20.185
and how they were meant
to be together

21:20.338 --> 21:22.671
and she should just
give into fate,

21:22.690 --> 21:24.282
calling her all the time,

21:24.358 --> 21:26.025
following her
everywhere she went, okay?

21:26.177 --> 21:27.618
He was popping up at places

21:27.695 --> 21:30.270
that she didn't even know
she was gonna be.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.607
I literally watched her
fall apart.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.201
Jesus, you never
talked about it much.

21:36.354 --> 21:38.521
I had no idea
it was that frightening.

21:38.539 --> 21:40.256
Frightening?

21:41.876 --> 21:44.860
The dude broke into our house.

21:44.879 --> 21:47.120
And... that's the night

21:47.140 --> 21:50.382
that she finally had
her mental breakdown.

21:50.535 --> 21:52.718
Were you there at the time?

21:52.870 --> 21:54.219
When my mom needed me the most,

21:54.372 --> 21:55.980
I was at some stupid
house party,

21:56.131 --> 21:57.798
playing beer pong.

21:57.817 --> 22:01.226
You know, if I would've
been there, who knows?

22:01.379 --> 22:03.379
Maybe I could've helped her
keep it together.

22:03.397 --> 22:06.324
Mara, you can't blame yourself
for that.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.951
Can't I? Just a little?

22:10.555 --> 22:14.832
I mean, I do feel responsible.

22:14.909 --> 22:16.917
That's why I've been
sleeping at home again.

22:18.579 --> 22:20.896
Yeah, don't remind me.

22:20.915 --> 22:25.176
Look, it's just gonna be
until things calm down, okay?

22:27.013 --> 22:31.090
So whatever happened to that
spin class stalker anyways?

22:31.242 --> 22:32.741
The police came,
they carted him away,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.685
but you know,
unfortunately by then,

22:34.837 --> 22:36.929
some real damage
had already been committed.

22:37.081 --> 22:41.508
And was she like committed?

22:41.527 --> 22:45.529
Yeah, briefly.
Just a couple of days.

22:45.681 --> 22:48.348
But since then,
she's just been getting by

22:48.368 --> 22:50.517
with support from
friends and family.

22:50.536 --> 22:54.430
Well, it's a good thing she
has a daughter like you then.

22:54.448 --> 22:56.707
James is a really big help too.

22:56.784 --> 22:59.359
Oh, yeah, I like James.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.361
Me too. I don't know.

23:01.381 --> 23:04.106
There was always something
different about him.

23:04.125 --> 23:05.883
You know, I couldn't quite
put my finger on it,

23:05.960 --> 23:10.012
but at least he's been a
positive force in my mom's life.

23:15.803 --> 23:16.894
Hey, Maggie.

23:18.472 --> 23:19.647
Kristen!

23:21.717 --> 23:26.553
You demolish
any marriages today?

23:26.572 --> 23:29.982
You know, three or four.
Usual amount.

23:30.134 --> 23:32.818
What are you doing?

23:32.970 --> 23:35.137
Solving the conflicts
in the Middle East.

23:35.156 --> 23:37.473
It's a lot harder
than I thought.

23:37.491 --> 23:40.751
What does it look like
I'm doing?

23:40.828 --> 23:44.813
Playing solitaire.

23:44.832 --> 23:47.383
I guess I just meant,
"How's it going?"

23:49.077 --> 23:51.411
What did you say the name
of this game was again?

23:51.431 --> 23:53.489
Solitaire.

23:53.507 --> 23:58.494
And how many people
usually play it at one time?

23:58.512 --> 24:00.012
Just, just one.

24:00.164 --> 24:02.940
Huh. James said
you were smart.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.685
Where is James?

24:06.837 --> 24:09.505
I'm not really sure.

24:09.523 --> 24:12.950
He's doing some errands
or something.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.791
What's wrong?
You're looking a little frantic.

24:20.943 --> 24:23.961
- No, I'm fine, it's--
- [phone ringing]

24:30.377 --> 24:33.787
What's the matter?
You're not gonna answer it?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.264
[ringing]

24:36.717 --> 24:37.725
Hello.

24:42.389 --> 24:43.481
Hello.

24:47.228 --> 24:49.545
Hello?

24:49.547 --> 24:51.489
No one there?

24:51.640 --> 24:54.325
No, there's not.

24:58.739 --> 25:01.314
No, no, you don't. No!

25:01.334 --> 25:03.167
Where are you rushing off to?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.338
I saw you!

25:16.240 --> 25:17.573
MARA: Hey, Mom, what's wrong?

25:17.575 --> 25:19.332
You hardly even touched
your food.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.927
Oh, yeah, don't mind me.

25:22.079 --> 25:25.189
I'm just a little stressed out
for some reason tonight.

25:25.266 --> 25:26.840
There's nothing wrong
with that.

25:26.859 --> 25:30.010
No, no, of course not.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.364
Are you getting any more
of those calls

25:33.515 --> 25:36.425
that we were
talking about today?

25:36.427 --> 25:37.535
Are you?

25:40.355 --> 25:42.281
You know, I did.

25:42.433 --> 25:44.449
What calls
are they talking about?

25:44.602 --> 25:46.451
I get unknown callers
all the time.

25:46.604 --> 25:48.862
I mean, it could be anybody.
For all we know,

25:48.881 --> 25:51.549
it could be just
a super dedicated telemarketer.

25:51.625 --> 25:54.534
Yeah, I mean, it could be,

25:54.554 --> 25:56.295
except, you know,
a major part of telemarketing

25:56.447 --> 25:59.298
is actually talking to the
person you're trying to reach.

25:59.450 --> 26:01.967
I don't know.
I'm sure it's nothing.

26:02.119 --> 26:04.787
Well, if it's nothing,
why did your lovely new bride

26:04.805 --> 26:06.805
race out into the backyard
afterwards,

26:06.957 --> 26:09.900
like her pants
were on flippin' fire?

26:10.052 --> 26:12.052
Mom, you did?

26:12.071 --> 26:15.798
You did that, babe? Why?

26:15.816 --> 26:19.577
I-- I thought I saw
somebody out there.

26:21.396 --> 26:22.471
And?

26:22.473 --> 26:23.747
And I was wrong.

26:25.901 --> 26:28.401
It's okay.
It's really okay, Mom.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.403
Does all this
have something to do

26:30.423 --> 26:32.423
with your breakdown last year?

26:35.820 --> 26:39.930
James told me that you came
close to losing your marbles.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.508
I did not--
I did not say that.

26:43.661 --> 26:45.327
Mom, would you please be...

26:45.346 --> 26:48.163
Interested in my
daughter-in-law's life?

26:48.182 --> 26:50.015
I thought that's the reason
why I came,

26:50.167 --> 26:52.835
was for all of us
to get to know each other.

26:52.837 --> 26:54.686
Well, you could be
a little nicer.

26:54.839 --> 26:57.189
And I could be from Kalamazoo,
but I'm not.

26:57.341 --> 27:00.692
- [scoffs]
- I am who I am.

27:00.845 --> 27:03.345
One of the great benefits of
getting to know each other--

27:03.347 --> 27:05.289
and believe me
there aren't many--

27:05.366 --> 27:07.273
is being able to say that

27:07.293 --> 27:10.419
and know for sure
that it's 100% true.

27:12.948 --> 27:17.301
Look, I'm sorry.

27:17.378 --> 27:21.029
I didn't come here
to be anyone's thorn,

27:21.048 --> 27:24.725
so if you want me to leave,
I will.

27:27.963 --> 27:30.964
No, no, Maggie, I...

27:30.983 --> 27:33.375
I wouldn't have that.

27:33.394 --> 27:34.634
We're, uh...

27:34.654 --> 27:36.403
We're family now, right?

27:38.716 --> 27:41.659
Do I have the greatest wife
or what?

27:44.664 --> 27:47.055
Oh, you know,
will you guys excuse me?

27:47.074 --> 27:49.074
- Mom...
- No, Mara, I'm fine.

27:49.226 --> 27:51.059
I just need to get
some fresh air.

27:51.078 --> 27:54.338
- Do you want me to--
- No, no. You guys just relax.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.841
I don't really blame her.

27:59.327 --> 28:01.845
It's a nice night out there.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.279
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:20.682 --> 28:23.534
- Maggie, she's, uh...
- [scoffs]

28:23.610 --> 28:24.868
She's sick, Mara.

28:25.020 --> 28:28.096
We should be pitying her,
not judging her.

28:28.115 --> 28:32.284
Well, we're not the one
looking down our noses.

28:32.436 --> 28:34.436
Look, Mom, I know
that I keep asking you this,

28:34.455 --> 28:36.955
but are you okay?

28:37.107 --> 28:40.200
Yeah. Don't worry about me.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.277
That's not an answer.

28:42.296 --> 28:45.389
Okay, well, you know,
for you, it is.

28:45.540 --> 28:47.874
I know I'm the reason that you
put off your move with Michael.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.560
- Mom...
- No, Mara.

28:49.711 --> 28:52.045
I don't want you putting
your life on hold for me.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.357
Well, you know, I don't want you
back in that place.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.072
What do you say we go inside,
and you show me some yoga moves?

29:02.149 --> 29:03.648
Huh? What do you think?

29:03.801 --> 29:05.634
KRISTEN: Is it still cool
to say, "Chill out?"

29:05.652 --> 29:06.985
[laughing]

29:07.137 --> 29:10.138
MARA: No, but I can show you
how to do that.

29:10.157 --> 29:12.916
Good. Tell me some words.

29:25.155 --> 29:26.579
Oh, hey.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.657
Listen, I wanted to thank you

29:28.675 --> 29:31.351
for making the john
handicap-friendly.

29:32.846 --> 29:35.680
Maybe you could, uh,
take a hint.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.590
Come again?

29:37.610 --> 29:41.853
Look, you could show a little
bit more kindness around here,

29:42.006 --> 29:43.447
okay?

29:43.524 --> 29:46.784
And as far as
the bathroom upgrade goes,

29:46.860 --> 29:48.768
you can thank your son
for that.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.847
Yeah, but I'm talking to you,

29:51.849 --> 29:53.874
and it seems like
you have something to say.

29:55.702 --> 29:57.628
Is it about your mother?

29:59.447 --> 30:02.524
Maggie, my mom has done nothing
but show kindness to you,

30:02.543 --> 30:06.528
including giving you
a room and board.

30:06.547 --> 30:10.974
And you know, I see her
trying to make it work.

30:11.126 --> 30:15.128
She's not tough like you,
and you see that, so I'm just...

30:15.147 --> 30:17.039
Honestly ,I'm really not sure

30:17.057 --> 30:19.483
why you have to make it
so hard on her.

30:19.634 --> 30:24.896
Well, you call it hard,
I call it helpful.

30:25.049 --> 30:28.158
The worst thing you can do
is indulge someone's fantasies

30:28.310 --> 30:33.055
when they're not
thinking straight.

30:33.073 --> 30:36.391
Fantasies?
You think she's enjoying this?

30:36.410 --> 30:40.003
Well, there you go,
using the dirty definition.

30:40.155 --> 30:42.914
But when you actually
break the word down,

30:43.067 --> 30:44.657
what it really means

30:44.677 --> 30:47.252
is that someone has seen
something that's not there,

30:47.404 --> 30:49.404
due to a psychological need.

30:49.423 --> 30:51.256
So what are you saying?

30:51.408 --> 30:54.017
I'm saying it's a good thing
she's seeing a head doctor.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.853
[chuckles]
Just saying.

30:58.265 --> 31:01.933
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

31:02.086 --> 31:06.012
I know how I can come off
sometimes,

31:06.031 --> 31:11.869
but maybe if you just try to see
the situation through my eyes,

31:12.020 --> 31:15.521
the way you're being protective
of your mother

31:15.541 --> 31:19.710
is kind of how I feel
about my son.

31:19.786 --> 31:23.939
And I might not be around
very much longer.

31:23.957 --> 31:27.792
In fact, it could be
sooner than later.

31:27.945 --> 31:31.630
So I, I guess I'm...

31:31.782 --> 31:33.724
I'm just trying to make sure

31:33.800 --> 31:38.286
that she can do what needs
to be done before I'm gone.

31:38.305 --> 31:42.140
I get it, I do.
It's just...

31:42.292 --> 31:43.642
It's a lot.

31:43.794 --> 31:45.652
Yeah, so is a mother's love.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.575
[yawns]

31:53.412 --> 31:58.398
Well, it's time for me
to get to bed.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.751
You have a nice night now, okay?

32:01.995 --> 32:03.086
Night.

32:11.989 --> 32:13.847
[creaking]

32:48.859 --> 32:51.543
[gasping]

32:51.695 --> 32:54.863
Hey, hey, it's me, it's me.

32:54.881 --> 32:56.548
You-- You had a bad dream.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.475
[panting]

32:58.626 --> 33:01.294
- Okay.
- You had a bad dream.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.647
Come here, come here.

33:03.798 --> 33:05.465
Oh, God.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.067
I'm so sorry.

33:08.879 --> 33:09.945
I'm so sorry.

33:37.924 --> 33:40.166
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.685
There you go.

33:41.762 --> 33:43.078
You look exhausted.

33:43.096 --> 33:46.339
Thanks, Steve. That was the look
I was going for.

33:46.358 --> 33:50.252
Did Rebecca Palmer confirm
for this morning?

33:50.254 --> 33:53.196
She should be here
in a few minutes.

33:53.273 --> 33:54.865
Great. Just enough time
to get caffeinated.

33:54.941 --> 33:56.033
Let me know when she arrives,
will ya?

33:56.184 --> 33:57.609
Sure thing.

33:57.761 --> 34:00.019
Oh, hey, I just spoke with
the building manager.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.780
Oh, what'd he say?

34:01.932 --> 34:04.374
Basically he said he follows
all the protocols in the book,

34:04.526 --> 34:06.268
but if you still like
to make a formal complaint,

34:06.286 --> 34:08.211
you're more than welcome.

34:08.363 --> 34:10.363
No, no, that's okay.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.774
I feel like I'm making
a mountain out of molehill,

34:12.793 --> 34:15.201
so let's just
put it behind us.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.054
Sounds good to me.

34:34.147 --> 34:37.407
- Hey, Steve.
- Yeah?

34:37.484 --> 34:40.151
Did my husband drop by here?

34:40.304 --> 34:43.580
Um, not that I know of. Why?

35:00.248 --> 35:02.173
[clears throat]
Yes?

35:02.326 --> 35:03.600
Rebecca Palmer's here.

35:03.677 --> 35:06.228
Ah, thanks.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.940
You okay?

35:10.091 --> 35:13.110
Yeah, yeah.
Can you show her in, please?

35:13.261 --> 35:14.778
All right.

35:14.929 --> 35:17.355
It's great to see you.
How are you today?

35:17.507 --> 35:22.268
I am getting a big fat divorce.
How good can I really be?

35:22.287 --> 35:23.695
All right, well,
let me see if I can make that

35:23.847 --> 35:25.347
a little easier for you.

35:25.365 --> 35:28.016
Well, let me start with...

35:28.034 --> 35:31.019
[ringing]

35:31.037 --> 35:32.612
Sorry. I should
put this on silent.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.689
Yes, you should.

35:34.708 --> 35:36.541
It's been a bit hectic.

35:36.693 --> 35:38.135
My mother-in-law's
been staying with us.

35:38.211 --> 35:40.137
[buzzing]

35:40.213 --> 35:43.974
Looks like someone
really wants to talk to you.

35:44.125 --> 35:46.050
Hmm. Apparently.

35:46.203 --> 35:47.144
[beep]

35:50.056 --> 35:54.651
Uh, okay, so were you able to
get the property list together?

35:54.728 --> 35:56.153
Yes, I did.

35:56.304 --> 35:59.156
I emailed that to you
three days ago.

35:59.307 --> 36:01.307
Right, yes, of course you did.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.325
[ding]

36:04.997 --> 36:07.164
Maybe this is a bad time.

36:07.315 --> 36:08.498
No, no, no, no, I'm...

36:11.653 --> 36:12.669
Oh, my God.

36:14.656 --> 36:17.065
What? What is wrong?

36:17.083 --> 36:21.011
I'm sorry, Rebecca. Will you
excuse me for a minute, please?

36:23.907 --> 36:26.850
[controlled breathing]

36:35.843 --> 36:37.527
By the time I came back
into my office,

36:37.604 --> 36:39.196
the client was already gone.

36:39.347 --> 36:40.846
Oh, God, what am I saying?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.532
She's probably
an ex-client by now.

36:42.609 --> 36:45.017
I'm sorry that
that happened, Kristen,

36:45.037 --> 36:47.853
but the second stalker,

36:47.873 --> 36:50.949
don't you think
that's unlikely,

36:51.101 --> 36:53.859
based on the odds of that thing
happening to someone twice?

36:53.879 --> 36:55.954
Lucky me.
You know, two-time loser

36:56.106 --> 36:58.364
with guys who hide in bushes
and terrorize women.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.217
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

37:00.368 --> 37:02.385
Now start from the beginning.

37:02.537 --> 37:05.113
You received some calls
from an unknown number,

37:05.115 --> 37:07.057
and no one was
talking back to you.

37:07.133 --> 37:10.227
Right, and then there was
somebody who was following me

37:10.378 --> 37:14.547
in the parking lot at work
and then outside of my house.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.400
And now you received a rose
you said

37:17.477 --> 37:19.736
that was left on
your office desk this morning?

37:19.887 --> 37:22.964
And a text asking me
if I liked it.

37:22.966 --> 37:24.299
Well, can I see that?

37:24.301 --> 37:25.575
Yeah.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.470
- Damn it.
- What?

37:28.472 --> 37:30.247
I forgot. I freaked out.

37:30.398 --> 37:31.748
When I saw the message,
I deleted it.

37:31.825 --> 37:32.732
That's okay.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.750
Oh, God.

37:33.901 --> 37:35.827
I feel like I'm losing it again.

37:35.979 --> 37:38.421
Easy, easy.
Now, last time we sat down,

37:38.573 --> 37:40.757
you said you were under
extra pressure at home

37:40.908 --> 37:42.759
from your mother-in-law
moving in.

37:42.910 --> 37:45.578
Yeah, yeah, Maggie.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.597
I take it
that's not going well.

37:47.674 --> 37:51.268
I mean, I get that she's sick,
you know,

37:51.419 --> 37:53.436
and so I'm trying
to just roll with it,

37:53.588 --> 37:56.831
but she is relentless
in her passive,

37:56.850 --> 37:59.759
not-so-passive aggression
towards me.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.278
And the timing on it all,

38:01.429 --> 38:03.780
it couldn't be more worse
with this new situation.

38:07.010 --> 38:08.934
Do you think
I'm going crazy again?

38:08.954 --> 38:11.955
A: you didn't last time,
and I don't like that word.

38:12.106 --> 38:13.865
And b: no.

38:14.017 --> 38:17.294
But I think you're pushed pretty
close to your limit right now.

38:17.445 --> 38:20.946
Now, how have you
been sleeping?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.948
- Not great.
- So you're tired.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.709
Your brain is playing
little tricks on you.

38:24.861 --> 38:26.136
And those phone calls,

38:26.212 --> 38:28.263
those could be
legitimate wrong numbers.

38:29.716 --> 38:33.368
And the text
that I can't show you.

38:33.370 --> 38:36.629
And the rose? That could be
James trying to surprise you.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.873
You could have a secret admirer
out there somewhere,

38:38.875 --> 38:40.875
trying to find a way
to reach out.

38:40.877 --> 38:42.986
But nothing wrong
with being extra cautious.

38:43.063 --> 38:47.824
These things keep happening,
you call me or...

38:47.975 --> 38:49.233
call the police.

38:49.386 --> 38:52.236
So, Dr. Lewis, you...

38:52.389 --> 38:54.497
you think I could have
a stalker again?

39:02.174 --> 39:03.173
[gasps]

39:27.366 --> 39:30.182
Wow! Look at you out here.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.535
What's next?
You gonna clean out the gutters?

39:32.687 --> 39:34.429
Put a fresh coat of paint
on the house?

39:34.447 --> 39:36.539
Yeah, I mean, that's me,
Mr. Suburbia.

39:36.691 --> 39:38.190
[laughing]

39:38.210 --> 39:40.118
Actually, I'm glad
that you're here.

39:40.270 --> 39:42.620
I wanted to talk to you.

39:42.772 --> 39:45.173
I'm concerned
about your mother.

39:46.276 --> 39:48.276
Yeah, me too.

39:48.278 --> 39:50.445
That's actually why
I wanted to talk to you.

39:50.463 --> 39:53.556
Oh, good.
I mean, to me, it seems like

39:53.633 --> 39:57.060
she's kinda losing it a little,
you know, mentally.

39:57.211 --> 40:00.730
Yeah, I see it too.

40:00.807 --> 40:03.566
This is how she acted the last
time with her breakdown?

40:06.053 --> 40:08.238
Yeah, I guess.

40:08.314 --> 40:11.649
To be honest, I wasn't paying
as close attention to her

40:11.801 --> 40:14.411
as I should have at the time
'cause I wasn't expecting it,

40:14.562 --> 40:16.913
but I am now.

40:17.064 --> 40:19.916
What about this stalker?
I mean, do you...

40:19.993 --> 40:22.810
Do you believe she's actually
being stalked by some guy?

40:22.812 --> 40:24.979
I think that she believes it.

40:24.998 --> 40:29.259
And you know, it's putting her
in a really bad spot mentally.

40:29.410 --> 40:31.836
You have to talk
to Maggie, James.

40:31.988 --> 40:33.337
She's making it worse.

40:33.490 --> 40:36.248
Yeah, my mom, she...

40:36.268 --> 40:39.251
She really knows
how to push people's buttons.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.920
She is who she is.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.831
So she declares.

40:43.833 --> 40:47.110
Look, if you can't
control Maggie,

40:47.261 --> 40:49.687
I have to convince my mom
to kick yours out of the house.

40:49.839 --> 40:52.690
I know, I know
it sounds harsh, but--

40:52.842 --> 40:54.784
I... I get it.

40:56.604 --> 40:59.605
Your mom's mental health
is more important.

40:59.624 --> 41:02.792
Yeah, good. Great.

41:02.944 --> 41:04.627
I'm glad we're on
the same page with that.

41:04.779 --> 41:06.296
One hundred percent.

41:06.372 --> 41:07.464
Come here.

41:08.950 --> 41:10.541
We love you, James.

41:10.694 --> 41:12.302
I don't know if I ever
really thanked you

41:12.453 --> 41:14.262
for making my mom so happy.

41:16.032 --> 41:19.476
Okay, well, I'll let you
get back to it.

41:23.297 --> 41:25.482
Oh, you missed a spot.

41:27.635 --> 41:28.651
Good eye.

41:34.567 --> 41:35.658
We have a problem?

41:42.483 --> 41:44.000
It's time we go for a ride.

41:44.077 --> 41:45.484
[sighs]

41:45.504 --> 41:47.337
I had a feeling.

41:52.252 --> 41:57.347
<i> ¶ [rock]</i>

42:01.244 --> 42:03.594
So you and the girls
seem chummier than ever.

42:03.747 --> 42:06.080
And when I see you
with the mother,

42:06.099 --> 42:08.358
I swear I can feel the love.

42:08.434 --> 42:09.859
So what's wrong with that?

42:10.011 --> 42:12.195
Look, we gotta stay focused.

42:12.346 --> 42:14.364
That's what I'm telling you.

42:17.018 --> 42:19.351
This place is empty.

42:19.371 --> 42:22.430
Yeah, he's supposed to be
meeting us here.

42:22.448 --> 42:23.540
[snaps fingers]
Hey!

42:23.691 --> 42:25.375
Back here.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.547
Sorry.
I had to start drinking.

42:30.698 --> 42:32.715
You know,
trailing soccer moms all day,

42:32.867 --> 42:34.609
it's thirsty business.

42:34.627 --> 42:38.037
We didn't come here
to drink with you, Max.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.614
[laughing]

42:39.632 --> 42:42.374
What are you still doing
with that stupid walker?

42:42.394 --> 42:44.477
Because, you idiot...

42:47.307 --> 42:52.485
I can't risk anyone seeing me
standing on my pins now, can I?

42:54.464 --> 42:57.131
Yeah, yeah,
you told me that before.

42:57.150 --> 42:59.150
I still don't understand
why you use that stupid thing.

42:59.302 --> 43:02.970
'Cause it makes me
a sympathetic character,

43:02.989 --> 43:05.582
even when I'm acting
like a raging bitch.

43:05.733 --> 43:08.142
Well, why don't you just
kill her with kindness?

43:08.161 --> 43:10.736
'Cause we're supposed
to be gaslighting her.

43:10.755 --> 43:14.332
It's a delicate act of balance.

43:14.484 --> 43:16.408
See, how it works is,

43:16.428 --> 43:19.429
somebody, me,

43:19.580 --> 43:23.248
puts a target on their heels
as much as possible,

43:23.268 --> 43:25.660
while someone else, him...

43:25.662 --> 43:30.773
Yeah, I hold their hand,
look 'em in the eye,

43:30.925 --> 43:32.925
and I say,

43:32.944 --> 43:35.169
"Everything's gonna be
all right, baby."

43:35.188 --> 43:37.113
Ooh.

43:37.264 --> 43:40.450
Gets 'em spinning real good.

43:40.601 --> 43:43.602
And then someone else
comes along, me, and...

43:43.622 --> 43:45.288
[imitates bomb dropping]

43:45.365 --> 43:46.956
Pushes them over the edge.

43:47.108 --> 43:49.959
Looks like someone's really
enjoying themselves.

43:50.036 --> 43:53.112
That's funny because I was about
to say the same thing about you.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.614
Ah, guilty as charged.

43:55.634 --> 43:58.450
Okay, okay, so I get it.

43:58.470 --> 44:02.287
Good con, bad con,
I get that whole thing.

44:02.307 --> 44:03.547
Why this lady?

44:03.700 --> 44:06.643
I came across
this blog she wrote

44:06.794 --> 44:10.146
about her nervous breakdown
last year.

44:10.297 --> 44:13.557
Some lovestruck fool
breaks into her house

44:13.710 --> 44:16.152
and drives her crazy.

44:16.303 --> 44:20.898
So I hire this guy to help me
double down on it.

44:21.050 --> 44:23.993
Yeah. Once we have her
committed,

44:24.145 --> 44:27.163
I'll be in complete control
of her finances.

44:27.314 --> 44:28.998
Won't take long.
We'll have it transferred

44:29.150 --> 44:31.668
to an offshore account
in the Caribbean.

44:31.819 --> 44:33.819
And what about
the lady's daughter?

44:33.838 --> 44:37.231
That's why we're here.

44:37.250 --> 44:40.659
The little brat
is getting real protective.

44:40.679 --> 44:45.014
She'll get rid of us soon
if we don't get this done.

44:45.166 --> 44:48.851
And chances are
she'll be successful,

44:49.003 --> 44:53.356
so we gotta do this thing
tonight.

44:53.507 --> 44:54.857
Right, son?

44:55.009 --> 44:57.110
Right, Ma.

45:05.519 --> 45:07.686
Mom, yoga's supposed
to relax you,

45:07.706 --> 45:09.956
not stress you out more.

45:12.285 --> 45:15.211
You and Michael are supposed to
be leaving for L.A. next week.

45:15.362 --> 45:17.880
The move has been pushed back
a few months, that's all.

45:17.957 --> 45:20.199
No, you mean your life is
being delayed because of me.

45:20.218 --> 45:24.295
No, because there's been a lot
of changes around here lately.

45:24.447 --> 45:25.888
Sweetheart, I'm gonna be fine.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.631
I mean, I know
Maggie can be tough,

45:27.784 --> 45:29.800
but I've got James
to help me handle her.

45:29.953 --> 45:31.635
And he really does love me.

45:31.788 --> 45:33.229
I know.

45:33.380 --> 45:35.714
He would never do anything
to hurt me.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.716
Yeah.

45:37.736 --> 45:39.551
Come on, let's take a break.
I'm dying.

45:39.571 --> 45:40.570
Okay.

45:42.574 --> 45:44.815
Your job's done here, Max.

45:44.968 --> 45:46.909
It's time for you
to get outta Dodge.

45:55.311 --> 45:57.144
Looks a little light.

45:57.163 --> 45:59.663
I told you the deal
when I hired you.

45:59.816 --> 46:03.426
You get the rest
when we all get ours.

46:12.604 --> 46:16.180
Fine, then I want to be there
tonight when it all goes down

46:16.332 --> 46:18.257
'cause otherwise this whole
thing has felt like a tease.

46:18.276 --> 46:21.944
Nah, that's a bad idea.

46:22.096 --> 46:24.505
See, first, you don't know
the layout of the house.

46:24.524 --> 46:28.785
And second, you are a little too
stimulated by this whole thing.

46:28.936 --> 46:31.695
And I haven't been pushing
that flippin' walker

46:31.848 --> 46:34.123
for my health either.

46:34.200 --> 46:39.854
I need to push this snowflake
over the edge tonight,

46:39.872 --> 46:45.802
and she cannot know that
I am physically capable of it.

46:45.953 --> 46:49.880
So you can't be
anywhere near the house.

46:50.033 --> 46:53.976
In fact, I don't even want you
in the same state.

46:56.039 --> 46:58.222
Okay.

46:58.374 --> 47:00.391
Then I'm gonna need
some more money.

47:00.543 --> 47:04.654
Upfront.
Not this when and if thing.

47:04.805 --> 47:06.805
I'm talking about right now.

47:06.825 --> 47:07.907
Ohh...

47:09.661 --> 47:12.161
You gotta be
flippin' kidding me.

47:12.313 --> 47:14.238
It's like my drunk daddy
used to say:

47:14.390 --> 47:17.333
"A little leverage
is better than any beverage."

47:22.565 --> 47:24.899
Huh? What do you say?

47:24.917 --> 47:27.176
Should we go to an ATM
or what?

47:27.328 --> 47:29.753
'Cause you don't want to go back
to prison, I know that.

47:29.906 --> 47:34.684
And you do not want me
telling people what I know.

47:38.672 --> 47:41.691
Okay, Max, you win.

47:42.935 --> 47:45.027
Finish your drink,

47:45.179 --> 47:48.439
and we'll go get you
your money.

47:48.591 --> 47:50.257
[pats counter]

47:50.276 --> 47:51.367
Dynamite.

47:54.873 --> 47:56.021
Dynamite.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.039
[chuckles]

48:00.436 --> 48:03.954
So you two, you two
ain't angry at me, right?

48:04.107 --> 48:06.107
Of course not, Max.

48:06.109 --> 48:08.384
Good, 'cause you'd do the same
you were me, right?

48:08.535 --> 48:10.369
Of course I would.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.889
'Cause we're all just
terrible people, right?

48:13.040 --> 48:14.891
When we have to be.

49:20.700 --> 49:22.959
[laughing]

49:37.624 --> 49:41.793
[kissing, laughing]

49:41.813 --> 49:43.145
Hey, you lovebirds...

49:45.299 --> 49:46.965
I'm turning in.

49:46.985 --> 49:48.317
Okay, Mom.

49:48.394 --> 49:50.728
Uh, good night.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.896
Sleep tight.

49:53.049 --> 49:55.382
Hey, honey,

49:55.401 --> 49:57.493
thank you for everything.

49:57.644 --> 49:58.977
I mean it.

49:58.997 --> 50:03.165
Uh, thank you, Maggie.
That means a lot to me.

50:15.179 --> 50:17.680
I'm going to bed.
I'm exhausted.

50:17.831 --> 50:19.998
Ah, me too.

50:20.018 --> 50:22.926
Yeah. Well, see you
in the morning, okay?

50:23.079 --> 50:25.429
I'll be out before my head
hits the pillow.

50:25.581 --> 50:27.023
Night, Maggie.

50:31.420 --> 50:32.361
[door closes]

51:09.567 --> 51:12.234
[water running]

51:28.753 --> 51:33.089
[water running]

51:46.587 --> 51:47.520
[water running]

51:51.183 --> 51:53.943
[brushing teeth]

52:01.285 --> 52:02.284
[water running]

52:41.233 --> 52:44.994
- Yeah, Mom's all sound asleep.
- Hmm.

52:47.147 --> 52:50.407
I can't believe your mom
was actually nice to me tonight.

52:50.559 --> 52:52.984
I told you.

52:53.004 --> 52:55.245
She really likes you.

52:55.398 --> 52:57.506
Hmm.

52:57.658 --> 53:00.009
Yeah, you know, I'm gonna make
more of an effort with her.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.568
That's incredible,

53:01.587 --> 53:05.014
considering that she hasn't even
met you halfway.

53:05.165 --> 53:08.350
I swear I'm gonna make her
love me even if it kills me.

53:08.502 --> 53:09.602
[chuckles]

53:16.861 --> 53:18.360
Good night, baby.

53:20.272 --> 53:21.922
Sweet dreams.

53:21.924 --> 53:23.032
Yeah.

53:37.106 --> 53:38.605
Yeah.

53:38.607 --> 53:40.049
Sweet dreams.

55:11.291 --> 55:13.142
- [thump]
- [gasps]

55:14.294 --> 55:15.227
James.

55:18.799 --> 55:20.232
James, hey, wake up.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.895
Honey, I think there's
someone in the house.

55:25.047 --> 55:26.989
Hey.

56:07.031 --> 56:08.614
[door opens]

56:36.452 --> 56:39.561
[owl hooting]

56:44.126 --> 56:46.568
Oh, my God. Please.
Please answer, please.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.404
<i> 911. What's your emergency?</i>

56:48.555 --> 56:50.981
My name is Kristen Walker.
I'm at 618 Whitfield Avenue.

56:51.133 --> 56:52.891
I think somebody
broke into my house.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.968
<i> - Ma'am, are you alone?</i>
<i> -</i> No, no.

56:54.987 --> 56:58.321
My daughter's here, my husband,
and my mother in-law.

56:58.474 --> 57:00.657
<i> Get everyone together.</i>
<i> I'm sending a car right away.</i>

57:00.809 --> 57:01.900
Okay, okay.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.086
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

57:08.241 --> 57:10.426
James! James, wake up!

57:10.577 --> 57:14.504
James, please come down here!

57:14.657 --> 57:18.175
Help! Somebody help me!
Please!

57:18.327 --> 57:21.828
Please, somebody help!
There's somebody down here!

57:21.830 --> 57:23.013
Help!

57:23.165 --> 57:25.849
Help! Somebody help me!

57:26.001 --> 57:28.610
Can you come?
Help! Help me!

57:28.762 --> 57:31.262
- Please! Please!
- Kristen!

57:31.282 --> 57:32.948
- Kristen!
- Help me!

57:33.099 --> 57:34.766
There's somebody down here!

57:34.785 --> 57:37.119
It's me, it's me!
Baby, it's me!

57:37.196 --> 57:39.270
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, it's me.

57:39.290 --> 57:41.940
There's nobody in the house.
There's nobody. It's just me.

57:41.959 --> 57:44.034
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

57:44.186 --> 57:45.944
It's just me.
It's just me.

57:45.963 --> 57:48.630
It's okay, it's okay.

57:48.782 --> 57:50.373
Nobody's in the house.

57:50.526 --> 57:51.875
Shh.

57:52.027 --> 57:54.136
No, no, no!

57:54.287 --> 57:57.473
[crying continues]

58:03.539 --> 58:07.374
[phone ringing]

58:07.376 --> 58:09.318
Hi, Denise.
I was gonna call you.

58:09.394 --> 58:10.986
How's Kristen Walker doing?

58:11.137 --> 58:13.638
I'm looking at her right now.

58:13.657 --> 58:16.474
She's actually very calm.
I really like her.

58:16.494 --> 58:17.493
<i> Yeah, me too.</i>

58:17.569 --> 58:19.886
Thanks for squeezing her in.

58:19.905 --> 58:21.722
<i> I'd hate for her</i>
<i> to have to spend another stay</i>

58:21.740 --> 58:23.056
<i> in a mental hospital,</i>

58:23.075 --> 58:24.407
even for a few days.

58:24.560 --> 58:26.651
- It was a close call.
-<i> I know.</i>

58:26.670 --> 58:28.745
She needs a lot of help, Denise.

58:28.897 --> 58:30.747
I know.

58:30.899 --> 58:33.324
<i> Well, she's gonna be evaluated</i>
<i> again next week by the state,</i>

58:33.344 --> 58:34.843
but I'm feeling pretty confident
we should get her home

58:34.995 --> 58:36.160
by the end of the month.

58:36.180 --> 58:38.013
From your mouth to God's ears.

58:38.164 --> 58:39.831
Actually, from your mouth.

58:39.850 --> 58:41.350
You're the one that talks them
through these things.

58:41.426 --> 58:43.076
I just give them
a place to stay.

58:43.095 --> 58:44.770
- And bless you for that.
- [knocking]

58:46.598 --> 58:49.507
Oh, um, Cheryl, I gotta go.

58:49.527 --> 58:51.434
I'll check with you later.

58:51.587 --> 58:52.694
Hi.

58:54.106 --> 58:55.346
Damn it!

58:55.366 --> 58:57.533
- Will you calm down?
- Calm down?

58:57.684 --> 59:01.019
Where did this halfway house
for crazies come from?

59:01.038 --> 59:03.038
They were supposed
to to commit her.

59:03.189 --> 59:05.766
Yeah, and you are the one
that said they would do that.

59:05.784 --> 59:08.043
Oh, damn it. All right.

59:08.194 --> 59:10.879
I say we find a way to
take her out while she's there.

59:10.956 --> 59:13.197
You're the husband.
You should get the money.

59:13.217 --> 59:16.552
We are crooks.
We're not murderers.

59:16.628 --> 59:18.445
And sometimes we do both.

59:18.447 --> 59:21.056
Or did I just dream about
what happened at that bar,

59:21.133 --> 59:22.057
Mr. Stabby?

59:22.134 --> 59:23.559
That was necessary.

59:23.635 --> 59:25.227
This is not.

59:25.304 --> 59:26.787
<i> DENISE: I'm sorry</i>
<i> I have to ask,</i>

59:26.789 --> 59:29.122
but this second stalker,

59:29.141 --> 59:31.625
you think this is like
a real thing?

59:31.643 --> 59:34.144
I don't know, but they can't
find any evidence

59:34.296 --> 59:36.572
of someone breaking in
or leaving the house,

59:36.723 --> 59:39.557
so all I know is that my mom
was doing a lot better

59:39.577 --> 59:41.225
before Maggie got here.

59:41.245 --> 59:44.321
The timing of all this
could be coincidental, but...

59:44.473 --> 59:47.808
Well, do you have any pictures
of James and his mother?

59:47.810 --> 59:50.735
Actually, yeah, I do.

59:50.754 --> 59:52.070
Text it to me, will you?

59:52.089 --> 59:53.171
Yeah.

1:00:07.496 --> 1:00:09.587
MAGGIE: You know,
you got me confused again.

1:00:09.607 --> 1:00:11.607
One more time.

1:00:11.683 --> 1:00:14.668
Did you come into
this woman's life to love her

1:00:14.670 --> 1:00:16.945
or to rob her?

1:00:17.022 --> 1:00:20.616
Don't worry about me.
I'm a pro, okay?

1:00:20.692 --> 1:00:23.118
But we do not need
to hurt these people.

1:00:23.269 --> 1:00:25.787
Let's say that
I agree with you.

1:00:25.939 --> 1:00:27.939
There are too many other people
in that support house.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.941
We don't even know
the floor plan.

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.018
All right, fine.

1:00:32.037 --> 1:00:35.705
But if I see you
siding with them instead of us,

1:00:35.858 --> 1:00:37.858
all bets are off.

1:00:37.876 --> 1:00:40.118
All right, big shot,

1:00:40.137 --> 1:00:42.195
so what in the hell
do we do now?

1:00:42.214 --> 1:00:44.622
We wait till
she comes back here,

1:00:44.642 --> 1:00:46.700
and we turn up the gas.

1:00:46.718 --> 1:00:49.627
Damn it!
You gotta be kidding me.

1:00:49.647 --> 1:00:51.888
And what do we do with Mara
in the meantime?

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:55.466
I don't know.
Maybe it's time that we try

1:00:55.486 --> 1:00:57.486
Max's killing with kindness
routine.

1:00:59.064 --> 1:01:02.324
Fine, as long as
she's not on to us.

1:01:02.401 --> 1:01:06.453
Question is, what are you
prepared to do if she is?

1:01:08.740 --> 1:01:10.407
[knocking]

1:01:10.559 --> 1:01:11.649
Yes?

1:01:11.669 --> 1:01:13.076
It's me.

1:01:13.228 --> 1:01:14.561
Come in.

1:01:14.579 --> 1:01:17.172
Do you see what I did?
I called first,

1:01:17.249 --> 1:01:19.916
so I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

1:01:20.068 --> 1:01:22.085
I'll keep that in mind.

1:01:22.237 --> 1:01:27.407
But what if I need you
for some of your old tricks?

1:01:27.426 --> 1:01:30.427
Oh, a real dog doesn't forget
the old stuff. What do you got?

1:01:30.579 --> 1:01:32.688
If I text you some pictures,

1:01:32.839 --> 1:01:35.248
you think you can find out
about a couple of people?

1:01:35.267 --> 1:01:37.008
I mean, I'll owe you one.

1:01:37.027 --> 1:01:40.862
And considering
what you owe me...

1:01:40.939 --> 1:01:42.364
Well, I don't mind you
owing me one.

1:01:42.441 --> 1:01:44.700
Those are some of
my favorite nights, Denise.

1:01:44.851 --> 1:01:47.518
Don't start.

1:01:47.538 --> 1:01:50.539
All right. Text me the pics.
I'll get right on 'em.

1:02:06.131 --> 1:02:07.889
"Maybe dangerous
or even life-threatening.

1:02:07.966 --> 1:02:10.800
Family history
may increase likelihood.

1:02:10.953 --> 1:02:13.787
In some cases, a combination
of medications can work better.

1:02:13.805 --> 1:02:17.733
Anyone with this disease will
need lifelong insulin therapy."

1:03:42.969 --> 1:03:45.562
You need something?

1:03:45.714 --> 1:03:48.882
No. No, sorry, um...
my toilet's clogged,

1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:50.826
so I just figured
I would use the one in here.

1:03:50.902 --> 1:03:52.218
Do you mind?

1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:55.238
Mind? It's your house, girlie.

1:03:55.390 --> 1:03:57.666
You can tinkle
anywhere you like.

1:03:57.817 --> 1:04:00.168
Tinkle? That's funny.

1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.337
I'll catch you later, Maggie.

1:04:12.591 --> 1:04:14.074
MICHAEL: You sure don't
want me to come?

1:04:14.092 --> 1:04:16.076
I know how hard
this must be on you.

1:04:16.078 --> 1:04:20.021
It's a cakewalk compared
to what she's going through.

1:04:20.098 --> 1:04:23.859
Thank you for driving me.
I'm just a little shaky.

1:04:24.010 --> 1:04:27.195
Anybody would be.
James didn't want to come?

1:04:27.347 --> 1:04:30.423
I didn't tell him
I was coming.

1:04:30.442 --> 1:04:34.094
I just-- I want to talk to her
about last night, alone.

1:04:34.112 --> 1:04:36.020
I know that you like James.

1:04:36.039 --> 1:04:38.540
Hey, Mar,
I barely know the guy.

1:04:38.617 --> 1:04:40.266
And quite honestly,

1:04:40.285 --> 1:04:42.769
nothing's been the same
ever since his mom moved in.

1:04:42.787 --> 1:04:47.382
- Yeah. Speaking of mothers...
- Good luck in there.

1:04:56.059 --> 1:04:57.893
- You must be Mara.
- Cheryl.

1:04:57.969 --> 1:04:59.636
- Come on in.
- How's she doing?

1:04:59.788 --> 1:05:01.804
She's a little out of it
because of the medication,

1:05:01.957 --> 1:05:04.124
but better overall
than you're probably thinking.

1:05:04.142 --> 1:05:06.126
Okay. Has she talked about
what happened?

1:05:06.144 --> 1:05:08.719
No, but she hasn't said much
of anything since she got here.

1:05:08.739 --> 1:05:11.648
Something tells me she'll be
really happy to see you.

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:14.075
Kristen, you have a visitor.

1:05:14.227 --> 1:05:15.410
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mom.

1:05:15.487 --> 1:05:17.153
CHERYL: I'll let you two
catch up.

1:05:17.305 --> 1:05:19.139
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me for anything.

1:05:19.157 --> 1:05:21.232
- Thanks, Cheryl.
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:21.251 --> 1:05:24.753
Honey, I'm okay, okay?
I'm fine.

1:05:24.904 --> 1:05:26.922
Really, I just--
I had a bad night.

1:05:27.073 --> 1:05:28.998
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

1:05:29.151 --> 1:05:31.334
I can't believe
I slept through it again.

1:05:31.486 --> 1:05:32.502
I let you down again.

1:05:32.654 --> 1:05:35.096
No, no, you didn't.

1:05:35.173 --> 1:05:37.432
And I am not sorry, okay?

1:05:37.583 --> 1:05:40.936
I don't like
when you see me like that.

1:05:41.087 --> 1:05:43.587
Can you tell me what happened?

1:05:43.607 --> 1:05:45.106
Yeah.

1:05:48.278 --> 1:05:51.187
I woke up because
I thought I heard something,

1:05:51.339 --> 1:05:55.525
but then I listened,
and there was nothing there,

1:05:55.677 --> 1:05:57.527
So I...

1:05:57.679 --> 1:06:00.604
I tried to go back to sleep,
but I couldn't,

1:06:00.624 --> 1:06:03.533
and so I figured
I would just go online,

1:06:03.685 --> 1:06:07.278
and I realized that my phone
was in the kitchen,

1:06:07.297 --> 1:06:10.131
so I went downstairs,

1:06:10.208 --> 1:06:13.026
and I saw that the door
was open,

1:06:13.044 --> 1:06:14.711
so i-I called 911,

1:06:14.863 --> 1:06:17.880
and then I-I went
into the entryway,

1:06:18.033 --> 1:06:20.867
and he darted past me.

1:06:20.885 --> 1:06:22.702
So you actually saw someone?

1:06:22.704 --> 1:06:25.146
I think so. I...

1:06:25.298 --> 1:06:28.466
I mean, there was
this shadow, at least.

1:06:28.485 --> 1:06:30.043
Mara, I swear to you.

1:06:30.061 --> 1:06:32.045
Trust me, there was somebody
in there with me.

1:06:32.047 --> 1:06:34.214
I believe you.

1:06:34.216 --> 1:06:36.065
You know, is there any way
that the person you saw

1:06:36.218 --> 1:06:38.159
could have been James
or Maggie?

1:06:38.311 --> 1:06:40.570
No. James was asleep,

1:06:40.722 --> 1:06:42.831
and Maggie can't even
get around.

1:06:42.982 --> 1:06:44.390
She couldn't have done that.

1:06:44.409 --> 1:06:48.077
So either I do have
a new guy following me,

1:06:48.230 --> 1:06:49.838
which like there's
no evidence of,

1:06:49.914 --> 1:06:51.006
except my word.

1:06:53.235 --> 1:06:55.918
Or, you know, I'm, um...

1:06:56.071 --> 1:06:58.013
I'm losing my mind.

1:06:58.089 --> 1:07:01.257
No, Mom, you're not, okay?

1:07:01.409 --> 1:07:03.409
We're gonna figure this out
together.

1:07:03.428 --> 1:07:05.411
I promise you,
we will figure this out.

1:07:05.413 --> 1:07:10.025
Mara, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1:07:10.176 --> 1:07:12.418
Mom, don't be sorry. Please.

1:07:12.437 --> 1:07:14.587
We're gonna figure it out, okay?
Promise.

1:07:14.606 --> 1:07:16.698
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:27.934
Hey, you okay, Mar?

1:07:27.936 --> 1:07:31.195
Yeah. It's just really hard
to see her like that.

1:07:31.214 --> 1:07:33.030
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1:07:33.050 --> 1:07:34.382
Okay.

1:07:41.892 --> 1:07:42.974
[engine starts]

1:07:55.238 --> 1:07:57.572
JAMES: Come on.
A little faster, please?

1:08:03.138 --> 1:08:04.913
JAMES: I'm gonna be
collecting my pension

1:08:04.989 --> 1:08:06.081
by the time we get there.

1:08:10.161 --> 1:08:12.069
Next time, I'm the invalid.

1:08:12.089 --> 1:08:15.590
Mm-hmm, yeah,
all right by me.

1:08:20.913 --> 1:08:23.080
[engine starts]

1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:26.267
[car drives off]

1:08:31.333 --> 1:08:33.358
¶ [jazz]

1:08:35.612 --> 1:08:36.945
MARA: So what happened?

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:41.174
Well, I mean...

1:08:41.192 --> 1:08:44.026
She had a breakdown.
You know, a mental one.

1:08:44.179 --> 1:08:45.845
Mm-hmm.

1:08:45.864 --> 1:08:48.197
- While you were...
- I was sleeping.

1:08:48.350 --> 1:08:51.292
I mean, I was sleeping at first,
until she started screaming.

1:08:51.369 --> 1:08:52.627
She was screaming so loud.

1:08:52.778 --> 1:08:54.963
I rushed down
as fast as I could,

1:08:55.114 --> 1:08:57.190
but she'd already called
the police by that point,

1:08:57.208 --> 1:08:59.134
and she was totally hysterical.

1:08:59.285 --> 1:09:01.694
There was nothing I could do.

1:09:01.696 --> 1:09:06.382
And you? You just, you slept
through the whole thing?

1:09:06.534 --> 1:09:09.369
Uh, well, same as you, dear.

1:09:09.387 --> 1:09:11.371
I always sleep like a log.

1:09:11.373 --> 1:09:13.815
I don't. Ever.

1:09:13.892 --> 1:09:16.559
But I guess the insulin
helps you sleep

1:09:16.711 --> 1:09:18.969
because you take it
every day, right?

1:09:18.989 --> 1:09:20.229
That's right.

1:09:20.382 --> 1:09:22.640
I've just never
seen you take it.

1:09:22.659 --> 1:09:27.829
Oh, well, you think I poke
myself in the living room

1:09:27.980 --> 1:09:30.981
between commercial breaks
on the TV?

1:09:31.001 --> 1:09:32.667
No.
[laughs]

1:09:32.818 --> 1:09:35.503
I do it in my room, alone.

1:09:37.232 --> 1:09:39.232
I went to see her today.

1:09:39.250 --> 1:09:40.824
I know.

1:09:40.844 --> 1:09:42.493
How do you know?

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:44.995
Well, 'cause I called
the recovery house.

1:09:45.015 --> 1:09:47.348
I spoke to this
very nice woman.

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:50.243
Cheryl was her name.
Yeah, she seemed very kind.

1:09:50.245 --> 1:09:51.853
Yeah, she is.

1:09:52.004 --> 1:09:54.597
I thought today might be
too soon to go see her,

1:09:54.749 --> 1:09:56.524
so I called over there
to ask Cheryl

1:09:56.676 --> 1:09:59.252
when I could spend
a couple hours with my wife.

1:09:59.270 --> 1:10:02.030
She suggested that I come by
tomorrow morning.

1:10:02.181 --> 1:10:04.866
Oh, you're such a sweet boy.

1:10:05.017 --> 1:10:07.944
A sweet boy who lets his mother
run all over his newlywed wife.

1:10:08.096 --> 1:10:11.280
Mara, I did not do that.

1:10:11.433 --> 1:10:12.448
Yeah, you did.

1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:14.209
That's not very nice.

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:17.695
And you have the nerve to call
it some sort of tragic play?

1:10:17.714 --> 1:10:19.380
You're the one who's helping her
write the damn thing.

1:10:19.457 --> 1:10:21.791
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:10:21.943 --> 1:10:23.885
Hmm. Really?

1:10:24.036 --> 1:10:27.296
Pushing her a little here,
pushing her a little there,

1:10:27.449 --> 1:10:29.298
making her uncomfortable
in her own home?

1:10:29.451 --> 1:10:32.393
Look, Mara, I understand
that you're upset.

1:10:32.470 --> 1:10:34.229
We all are upset.

1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:36.213
Oh, really?

1:10:36.233 --> 1:10:37.732
'Cause you guys
don't seem upset at all.

1:10:37.809 --> 1:10:42.052
Flippin' kids these days,
I swear!

1:10:42.072 --> 1:10:45.740
Hey, what happened to having
some respect for your elders?

1:10:45.891 --> 1:10:49.244
You say "respect"
like you have one ounce of it.

1:10:51.139 --> 1:10:52.413
You know, this is a joke.

1:10:52.565 --> 1:10:55.232
I'm gonna stay with Michael

1:10:55.252 --> 1:10:57.994
until we figure out what it is
that we need to do.

1:10:58.146 --> 1:10:59.921
Don't you want anything to eat?

1:11:00.072 --> 1:11:02.006
Lost my flippin' appetite.

1:11:06.170 --> 1:11:08.096
So how do you think
this is going?

1:13:10.962 --> 1:13:12.778
<i> Hey, Ross, getting back to you</i>
<i> on that photo.</i>

1:13:12.797 --> 1:13:14.947
<i> Names you gave me</i>
<i> don't match the ones I found.</i>

1:13:14.966 --> 1:13:17.950
<i> It gets worse. Both have been</i>
<i>arrested in the past separately</i>

1:13:17.952 --> 1:13:19.877
<i> for running cons down south.</i>

1:13:19.896 --> 1:13:22.622
<i> Give me a call back.</i>
<i> I'll tell you what I know.</i>

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:26.142
<i> [beeping]</i>

1:13:26.294 --> 1:13:27.735
<i> [line ringing]</i>

1:13:27.812 --> 1:13:29.553
<i> This is Denise Lewis.</i>

1:13:29.572 --> 1:13:30.721
<i> - I can't take your call now.</i>
<i> -</i> Damn it.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.465
<i> Leave me a message,</i>

1:13:32.483 --> 1:13:34.075
<i> and I'll get back to you</i>
<i> just as soon as I can.</i>

1:13:34.226 --> 1:13:37.728
<i>If it's an emergency, call 911.</i>
<i> [beep]</i>

1:13:37.747 --> 1:13:40.306
Denise, here's your emergency.

1:13:40.324 --> 1:13:42.250
My deep-dive guy
got back to me.

1:13:42.326 --> 1:13:45.402
Those people,
Maggie and James,

1:13:45.422 --> 1:13:48.071
they're not
who they say they are.

1:13:48.091 --> 1:13:50.091
They could be dangerous.

1:13:50.168 --> 1:13:52.576
Call me when you get this.

1:13:52.595 --> 1:13:54.262
MAGGIE: Two questions.

1:13:54.413 --> 1:13:56.989
What are you doing
in our house?

1:13:57.008 --> 1:13:59.750
And what exactly do you mean
by "dangerous?"

1:13:59.769 --> 1:14:02.828
I know what you and your son
are doing here, lady.

1:14:02.847 --> 1:14:05.440
Are you sure about that?
Maybe you should ask him.

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:07.850
[crack]

1:14:08.002 --> 1:14:09.610
[thud]

1:14:17.287 --> 1:14:18.844
So what is this now?

1:14:18.863 --> 1:14:22.105
This? This is your plan
going from bad to worse!

1:14:22.125 --> 1:14:25.534
I mean he said we're not
who we say we are, dummy.

1:14:25.687 --> 1:14:28.629
I mean, who's he talking to?

1:14:28.706 --> 1:14:30.189
Kristen's shrink.

1:14:30.191 --> 1:14:32.133
Oh, damn it all.

1:14:35.213 --> 1:14:36.637
- Is he--
- Yeah.

1:14:36.789 --> 1:14:38.380
I had to.
I had no choice.

1:14:38.533 --> 1:14:41.367
Well, what the hell
are we gonna do now?

1:14:41.385 --> 1:14:44.203
I don't know, Maggie.
This is your plan.

1:14:44.222 --> 1:14:46.147
I know that!

1:14:46.298 --> 1:14:47.965
All right,
what we need to do is--

1:14:47.984 --> 1:14:50.485
Okay, just shut up!
Shut up!

1:14:51.879 --> 1:14:55.214
Okay, we pack our stuff,
and we...

1:14:55.233 --> 1:15:01.070
we get as much distance
between us and here by dawn.

1:15:01.222 --> 1:15:03.146
- Okay?
- Agreed.

1:15:03.166 --> 1:15:07.168
We're just lucky that little
bitch isn't around right now.

1:15:32.770 --> 1:15:34.695
Get home safe, Phillip.
I'll see you next week.

1:15:34.772 --> 1:15:36.179
Sure thing.

1:15:36.199 --> 1:15:37.532
[sighs]

1:15:40.945 --> 1:15:42.703
<i> ROSS: Denise?</i>
<i> Here's your emergency.</i>

1:15:42.855 --> 1:15:44.539
<i> My deep-dive guy</i>
<i> got back to me.</i>

1:15:44.615 --> 1:15:46.374
<i> Those people,</i>
<i> Maggie and James,</i>

1:15:46.450 --> 1:15:48.100
<i> they're not</i>
<i> who they say they are.</i>

1:15:48.119 --> 1:15:49.210
<i> They could be dangerous.</i>

1:15:49.287 --> 1:15:50.878
Oh, my God.

1:15:56.110 --> 1:15:57.385
[phone ringing]

1:15:57.536 --> 1:15:58.944
Denise, hi.
You're on speaker.

1:15:58.963 --> 1:16:00.613
<i> How's Kristen?</i>

1:16:00.615 --> 1:16:02.890
<i> She's good,</i>
<i> keeping mostly to herself,</i>

1:16:02.967 --> 1:16:05.893
but peaceful enough, considering
the last couple of days.

1:16:05.970 --> 1:16:08.879
Just listen to me.
I got a message from my ex.

1:16:08.898 --> 1:16:11.624
<i> This patient of mine</i>
<i> and her daughter,</i>

1:16:11.642 --> 1:16:14.569
<i> they're in real trouble</i>
<i> with these people.</i>

1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:16.070
What did he say?

1:16:16.147 --> 1:16:18.388
Well, I don't know
the details, but...

1:16:18.408 --> 1:16:20.223
<i> He's a private investigator</i>

1:16:20.243 --> 1:16:21.817
<i> who was looking into</i>
<i> the husband and the mother,</i>

1:16:21.969 --> 1:16:25.079
<i> and he said they're not</i>
<i> who they say they are.</i>

1:16:25.156 --> 1:16:28.583
Wait, what? Oh, my God.

1:16:36.834 --> 1:16:41.387
I just want to get my mom's
jewelry box and get out of here.

1:17:09.792 --> 1:17:11.792
Yes, that will be fine.

1:17:13.963 --> 1:17:15.630
[whispering]
Are they both home?

1:17:15.706 --> 1:17:18.040
Yeah, I think so.

1:17:18.192 --> 1:17:19.708
All right,
so let's go up there,

1:17:19.861 --> 1:17:21.694
grab her jewelry box
and get the hell out of here.

1:17:21.696 --> 1:17:23.195
No. I'll grab it really quick,
you just stay here,

1:17:23.214 --> 1:17:24.713
and then we'll go together.

1:17:24.866 --> 1:17:27.290
- Okay, well, you should hurry.
- Oh, you think so?

1:17:27.310 --> 1:17:28.868
I was gonna make
a quick sandwich first.

1:17:28.870 --> 1:17:30.478
This is you worrying?

1:17:58.490 --> 1:18:01.175
- [muffled screaming]
- Shh! Go to sleep, kid.

1:18:01.252 --> 1:18:02.927
Go to sleep.

1:18:50.968 --> 1:18:54.019
Where the hell are you?
We gotta hit the road!

1:18:55.139 --> 1:18:56.564
[gasps]
You can walk.

1:19:00.236 --> 1:19:02.127
It's a miracle.

1:19:02.129 --> 1:19:06.056
It was you.
You and James the entire time,

1:19:06.075 --> 1:19:08.391
messing with my mom,
making her crazy.

1:19:08.411 --> 1:19:12.321
First of all, girlie,
that's not our names.

1:19:12.473 --> 1:19:16.141
And second, it didn't really
take that much effort.

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.646
Only problem was
we didn't go far enough.

1:19:20.648 --> 1:19:23.165
But those days are over.

1:19:23.317 --> 1:19:25.075
What do you mean?

1:19:25.094 --> 1:19:29.263
Why did you have
to come back tonight?

1:19:29.414 --> 1:19:30.839
Get away from her!

1:19:30.992 --> 1:19:32.825
It's too late for that.

1:19:32.827 --> 1:19:34.510
No, it's not!

1:19:34.662 --> 1:19:37.162
We're gonna tie her up,
and we're gonna get in the car,

1:19:37.181 --> 1:19:38.939
and you and I will be drinking
margaritas on the beach

1:19:39.016 --> 1:19:41.500
in Mexico before
anybody knows about this.

1:19:41.502 --> 1:19:43.335
Who put you in charge?

1:19:43.354 --> 1:19:45.762
I have made myself clear
from the start, Jackie!

1:19:45.782 --> 1:19:47.840
I do not want
either one of them hurt.

1:19:47.842 --> 1:19:50.534
And I've made myself clear!
I'm not going back to prison!

1:19:52.847 --> 1:19:54.346
Oh, now look what you did!

1:19:54.365 --> 1:19:56.624
- I'll get her.
- You idiot!

1:20:22.634 --> 1:20:23.651
Mara?

1:20:25.896 --> 1:20:27.822
Mara!

1:20:27.898 --> 1:20:31.492
Come on.
I'm trying to help you.

1:20:36.390 --> 1:20:38.123
Michael! Michael!

1:20:40.744 --> 1:20:43.395
Michael! Michael! Michael!

1:20:43.414 --> 1:20:45.731
Michael, wake up, wake up.
We gotta go.

1:20:45.749 --> 1:20:47.583
- What?
- Wake up, wake up.

1:20:47.735 --> 1:20:50.678
Looks like your boo
got himself a boo-boo.

1:20:50.754 --> 1:20:52.847
Stand up, girlie.

1:20:54.016 --> 1:20:55.182
Real slow.

1:20:58.503 --> 1:21:00.095
You know, it's a shame.

1:21:00.247 --> 1:21:04.583
There's something about
your spirit I kinda like,

1:21:04.602 --> 1:21:06.752
even if you were
a pain in my ass

1:21:06.770 --> 1:21:08.863
at every flippin' turn.

1:21:09.014 --> 1:21:10.513
- Mara!
- Mom!

1:21:10.533 --> 1:21:12.700
Get away from her!

1:21:12.776 --> 1:21:15.427
Ah, finally something
goes right on this job.

1:21:15.446 --> 1:21:17.538
Enough!
[groans]

1:21:17.615 --> 1:21:20.432
You flippin' fool!
Why did you do that?

1:21:20.434 --> 1:21:21.375
[distant sirens]

1:21:21.526 --> 1:21:25.104
Screw this family!

1:21:25.122 --> 1:21:30.200
[sirens approaching]

1:21:30.219 --> 1:21:31.701
Mom, what are you doing here?

1:21:31.721 --> 1:21:33.779
Oh, God!
I heard you were in trouble.

1:21:33.797 --> 1:21:36.632
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1:21:36.784 --> 1:21:38.634
What the hell happened here?

1:21:38.786 --> 1:21:41.637
It was-- It was Maggie.

1:21:41.789 --> 1:21:44.231
Mom, that's not her name.

1:21:44.308 --> 1:21:45.474
It's Jackie.

1:21:45.626 --> 1:21:47.292
Well, where's Jackie now?

1:21:47.311 --> 1:21:49.570
She left the house.

1:21:53.409 --> 1:21:54.575
Come here.

1:22:00.824 --> 1:22:02.732
I'm so glad you two are here.

1:22:02.752 --> 1:22:05.252
We are, too, believe me.

1:22:05.329 --> 1:22:09.256
Yeah. We kinda need to get out
of the house these days anyways.

1:22:09.333 --> 1:22:12.075
Mara's putting her plans on hold
a little while longer,

1:22:12.094 --> 1:22:15.154
but this time
I'm not complaining.

1:22:15.156 --> 1:22:16.655
Neither is my boyfriend.

1:22:16.674 --> 1:22:18.248
He's being a saint
about all of this.

1:22:18.267 --> 1:22:21.418
Oh, I hear that.

1:22:21.437 --> 1:22:24.163
Denise, I'm so sorry
about your ex's passing.

1:22:24.181 --> 1:22:25.330
You mean his murder.

1:22:25.332 --> 1:22:28.275
Oh, imagine how sorry you'd feel

1:22:28.352 --> 1:22:30.169
if you were the reason
that he's dead.

1:22:30.171 --> 1:22:32.187
Come on, don't say that.

1:22:32.339 --> 1:22:35.765
I'm not. It's true, whether
I say it out loud or not.

1:22:35.785 --> 1:22:39.845
Have the police been able
to tell you anything else?

1:22:39.863 --> 1:22:43.958
Well, um, James's real name is
Paul Northcutt.

1:22:46.370 --> 1:22:49.946
I know this sounds crazy,
but he was...

1:22:49.966 --> 1:22:51.799
Conning you out
of every dime you had, Mom.

1:22:51.875 --> 1:22:55.285
Okay, yes, Mara, he was,
but he also saved my life.

1:22:55.304 --> 1:22:57.287
Mm-hmm.

1:22:57.306 --> 1:22:59.289
I mean, he couldn't have been
all that bad.

1:22:59.308 --> 1:23:01.141
And, um, Maggie?

1:23:01.293 --> 1:23:04.369
- You mean Jackie Turner?
- Yes.

1:23:04.388 --> 1:23:08.056
According to Ross' guy,
she's been arrested a few times,

1:23:08.209 --> 1:23:12.377
mostly for short-term cons
with James and some with others.

1:23:12.396 --> 1:23:16.048
But she's a lot more dangerous
than her rap sheet hinted at.

1:23:16.066 --> 1:23:18.325
And we have no idea
where she is now.

1:23:18.402 --> 1:23:20.143
I'm sure she's still out there,

1:23:20.162 --> 1:23:23.388
just running the same game
on another unsuspecting family.

1:23:23.407 --> 1:23:25.457
She can't hide forever.

1:23:29.079 --> 1:23:32.673
- Would you look at this place?
- It's enormous.

1:23:35.252 --> 1:23:38.237
You're looking a little nervous.
Are you all right?

1:23:38.239 --> 1:23:41.664
Maybe I am. A little.

1:23:41.684 --> 1:23:44.259
I need this to go right.

1:23:44.411 --> 1:23:46.745
Don't worry, honey.
Mama's here.

1:23:46.764 --> 1:23:51.600
I'm gonna make sure
that man in there is yours.

1:23:51.752 --> 1:23:53.444
All yours. And soon.

1:23:54.588 --> 1:23:56.447
Okay.

1:24:02.112 --> 1:24:03.537
[doorbell rings]

1:24:10.120 --> 1:24:12.104
- Hi, I'm Stephanie.
- I'm Bridget.

1:24:12.122 --> 1:24:15.865
- Yes, Landon's mentioned you.
- He's mentioned you as well.

1:24:15.885 --> 1:24:17.885
This is my mother, Christine.

1:24:17.961 --> 1:24:19.111
- Hi.
- Hello.
