00:00.344 --> 00:01.802
<i>Previously on</i> The Resident...

00:01.813 --> 00:03.570
<i> Clearly you two are sleeping together.</i>

00:03.580 --> 00:05.301
<i>She must be amazing
for you to take me on.</i>

00:05.312 --> 00:06.795
Finally get to go home, Bradley?

00:06.806 --> 00:10.209
Finally. Yes. I can't wait
to get home and then sleep.

00:10.220 --> 00:13.686
So, you chose saving money
over patients' safety?

00:13.697 --> 00:16.100
Our CEO needs to be a doctor.

00:16.111 --> 00:17.274
<i> Claire wanted to see me?</i>

00:17.285 --> 00:19.771
<i>- The CEO will see you now.</i>
<i>- Dr. Bell?</i>

00:19.781 --> 00:21.332
<i> You've been with us a long time.</i>

00:21.343 --> 00:23.173
<i>It's difficult for me to tell you this.</i>

00:23.341 --> 00:25.545
Nic, I heard.

00:26.622 --> 00:27.823
This isn't over yet.

02:04.475 --> 02:06.678
This better not involve
another grown man's ass.

02:06.688 --> 02:09.648
- I'm serious.
- Don't be ridiculous.

02:09.657 --> 02:11.382
It's a guy with a broken weenie.

02:11.392 --> 02:14.553
I'm paging surgery,
but you need to admit him.

02:14.563 --> 02:16.821
Why? Irving, why?

02:16.831 --> 02:19.357
Because I'm Lennon
and you're not McCartney.

02:19.367 --> 02:20.826
But you could be.

02:20.836 --> 02:21.993
Could be Yoko.

02:22.003 --> 02:23.362
Oh, and it's just too much fun.

02:23.372 --> 02:25.363
Dudes! Fire in the hole.

02:25.373 --> 02:27.398
Aah! I'm dead. What up?

02:27.408 --> 02:29.368
- What's up with you?
- Nothing much.

02:29.378 --> 02:31.070
Just catching my second wind
after another

02:31.080 --> 02:33.071
brutal all-nighter.
What you got there, D-Bear?

02:33.081 --> 02:35.673
Helping Irving with a broken weenie.

02:35.683 --> 02:37.509
Oh, heck yes. But what about this, huh?

02:37.519 --> 02:39.043
What about helping me out

02:39.053 --> 02:41.579
with that double date we were
talking about? Hmm? Pick a night.

02:41.589 --> 02:43.322
I will. Sorry. I've been slammed.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.796
- You know how it is around here.
- Don't you burn me on this.

02:45.807 --> 02:47.618
- Trying to woo Noni.
- Noni? Our Noni?

02:47.628 --> 02:49.272
- Hot Noni?
- The very same.

02:49.283 --> 02:51.093
I think she might be the one
for all of this.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.524
So I need a wingman and a wingwoman.

02:53.534 --> 02:55.461
You and Priya would be perfect.
Help me out.

02:55.471 --> 02:57.029
You know I got your back.

02:57.039 --> 02:58.960
Page me right after this, bro.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.131
Speaking of dates,

03:00.141 --> 03:02.066
- you have one with Mr. Berman.
- Okay.

03:02.076 --> 03:04.035
- Mr. Berman.
- Oh.

03:04.045 --> 03:05.737
I'd like you to meet Dr. Pravesh.

03:05.747 --> 03:08.262
- He'll be taking care of you today.
- So cool. Hey.

03:08.273 --> 03:10.524
Now, tell Dr. Pravesh what you told me.

03:10.535 --> 03:13.746
You know, it just feels like a
hamstring, but a little bit hi...

03:17.426 --> 03:19.750
Oh. I'm sorry, man. This looks urgent.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.918
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.055
- Did I pass out?
- Yep.

03:24.065 --> 03:26.124
Can I get some drugs for the pain?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.129
<i> Chastain Memorial Hospital.</i>

03:30.139 --> 03:31.963
<i>Incredible things are happening here</i>

03:31.973 --> 03:34.333
<i>with our cutting-edge technology,</i>

03:34.343 --> 03:36.067
<i>our groundbreaking research.</i>

03:36.077 --> 03:37.836
<i>We deliver innovative care</i>

03:37.846 --> 03:39.237
<i>to keep your family safe.</i>

03:39.247 --> 03:40.838
Fix your face.

03:40.848 --> 03:43.075
It says, "I'm going to pounce on Bell."

03:43.085 --> 03:45.095
He fired Nic. What do you expect?

03:45.106 --> 03:47.411
A verbal, perhaps physical altercation

03:47.421 --> 03:50.603
resulting in your immediate termination.

03:50.642 --> 03:53.251
But then you get to
live happily ever after

03:53.261 --> 03:55.186
with Nic under a bridge somewhere.

03:55.196 --> 03:57.255
Was that your attempt at sarcasm?

03:57.265 --> 03:59.525
It was not an attempt. It was a success.

03:59.535 --> 04:03.996
Look, I miss Nic, too, but
she can take care of herself.

04:04.006 --> 04:05.364
So, one more time.

04:05.374 --> 04:07.610
Fix your face.

04:09.845 --> 04:11.270
Don't be an ass.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.504
Hey, guys. Crazy times, right?

04:13.514 --> 04:15.110
It's like, what? What's even happening?

04:15.121 --> 04:16.550
Quick question for either of you...

04:16.560 --> 04:19.016
Bradley, I love you like the
little brother I always wanted,

04:19.027 --> 04:21.279
but I can't right now. Later, though.

04:21.290 --> 04:23.448
You and me, we are hanging
and talking about,

04:23.458 --> 04:25.516
you know...

04:27.228 --> 04:29.987
- stuff.
- Okay. Yes. I love stuff.

04:29.997 --> 04:31.857
- Um, Mina...
- What he said.

04:31.867 --> 04:34.225
Wait. Wait. Are you saying
that I'm the brother

04:34.235 --> 04:35.660
that you always wanted, too?

04:36.154 --> 04:37.489
Not that part.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.619
It's, like, the main part.

04:42.814 --> 04:45.069
This is the beginning of a new era.

04:45.079 --> 04:48.139
One defined by The Chastain Difference.

04:48.149 --> 04:52.143
And, as your new CEO, I'm grateful.

04:52.153 --> 04:55.713
I'm humble. I'm eager
to work with each of you,

04:55.723 --> 04:57.682
so that, together...

04:57.692 --> 04:59.650
What do you think he's saying?

04:59.660 --> 05:02.554
How sorry he is he won't have time
to kill any more people in the OR.

05:03.628 --> 05:04.823
It's Bell.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.591
He'll make time.

05:06.601 --> 05:09.206
You know, there are few
things that keep me up at night.

05:09.217 --> 05:11.562
But surgeons working overtime
to fill the void

05:11.572 --> 05:14.066
I'll be leaving in the OR
is one of them.

05:14.076 --> 05:16.568
And that's why one of the most gifted

05:16.578 --> 05:18.869
cardiothoracic surgeons
in the country...

05:18.879 --> 05:21.405
AJ Austin... is meeting with me today,

05:21.415 --> 05:23.874
and he will choose Chastain.

05:23.884 --> 05:25.244
Why?

05:25.254 --> 05:29.114
Because his CEO is also a surgeon.

05:29.124 --> 05:32.092
And I can ensure
this hospital is a doctor...

05:33.929 --> 05:35.198
friendly...

05:38.699 --> 05:40.535
environment.

05:47.278 --> 05:49.214
Oh, my God. It's Bradley.

05:55.117 --> 05:56.908
His pulse is thready.

05:56.918 --> 05:58.443
We... just... some help here.

05:58.453 --> 06:00.745
Just carefully. He might have
a C-spine injury.

06:00.756 --> 06:02.047
Oh, God.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.715
Someone page Trauma!

06:03.725 --> 06:06.218
I need a backboard and
a lac tray in here stat.

06:06.228 --> 06:08.153
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
Let me in.

06:08.163 --> 06:09.764
Oh, God.

06:12.668 --> 06:14.764
Holding pressure's not working.

06:15.836 --> 06:17.728
I need that suture kit now!

06:17.738 --> 06:19.797
JT, stabilize that...

06:19.807 --> 06:22.177
that impalement...

06:24.316 --> 06:25.407
What are you doing?

06:25.418 --> 06:27.680
I'll use the cath balloon
to apply pressure from within

06:27.691 --> 06:30.446
- to control the bleeding.
- That's not how we control bleeding.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.680
We got to get him into the OR.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.282
It's not how surgeons like
to control the bleeding,

06:33.293 --> 06:34.722
but it's how we did it in the front

06:34.733 --> 06:37.235
when there's no time
to get someone into surgery.

06:43.531 --> 06:45.424
Okay, we're good.

06:45.434 --> 06:48.460
Load him on the backboard.
Let's go. Move, move, move.

06:48.470 --> 06:49.761
<i> I'm sorry, Bradley,
am I boring you? Wake up.</i>

06:49.771 --> 06:51.463
<i> He just completed a 30-hour shift.</i>

06:51.473 --> 06:52.864
<i> Bradley, do you need
to go home and rest?</i>

06:52.874 --> 06:54.098
<i> No, sir, Dr. Bell.</i>

07:00.785 --> 07:03.011
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:03.451 --> 07:04.809
Where's Trauma?

07:04.819 --> 07:06.511
- Page Dr. Nolan.
- I'm here. Talk to me.

07:06.521 --> 07:08.430
- 32-year-old male.
- I know who Bradley is.

07:08.441 --> 07:11.215
Deep neck laceration.
Chest impalement and fractured tib-fib.

07:11.225 --> 07:14.186
- He should have been in the OR 5 minutes ago.
- We need a full assessment

07:14.196 --> 07:15.686
- before you crack open his chest.
- No time for that.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.560
- Where's Bell?
- Washing blood off his hands.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.323
Oh, my God, Bradley. How can I help?

07:19.333 --> 07:21.380
- You can't. We're good.
- He's my friend.

07:21.391 --> 07:24.196
I'm not going anywhere. BP's 107/63.

07:24.206 --> 07:26.081
- Heart rate's 94.
- Vitals are stable.

07:26.092 --> 07:27.901
No output from the chest tube.
We have time.

07:27.912 --> 07:29.701
That metal could be
tamponading a major vessel.

07:29.711 --> 07:31.661
- Could rupture at any moment.
- We need to figure out

07:31.672 --> 07:33.598
what caused Bradley's fall
before we rush off to the OR.

07:33.609 --> 07:35.854
Yeah, and while we discuss
that, he dies on this gurney.

07:35.865 --> 07:37.676
Or he dies under anesthesia from a
pre-existing medical condition.

07:37.687 --> 07:39.827
He took a header off the roof.
It's a suicide attempt.

07:39.838 --> 07:43.186
- You hear hoofbeats, it's a horse, not a zebra.
- Stop. I don't think he jumped.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.482
What are <i> you</i> doing?

07:44.492 --> 07:46.819
- The OR is ready for him.
- He's not ready for the OR.

07:46.830 --> 07:47.985
He's a trauma patient.

07:47.995 --> 07:50.155
Trauma attending makes the call, Conrad.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.323
Take him to the OR. I'm gonna scrub in.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.591
Let's go.

07:53.601 --> 07:56.653
Wait. Look at his hands and feet.

07:56.664 --> 07:58.132
He's posturing.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.203
Right pupil's blown.

08:05.213 --> 08:07.337
Send him for a scan
of his brain and chest.

08:08.017 --> 08:09.941
- Quickly.
- All right, let's go.

08:09.951 --> 08:13.173
Is he even gonna fit into the CT machine
with that thing in his chest?

08:17.275 --> 08:18.917
Here you go.

08:18.927 --> 08:20.196
Thanks.

08:23.984 --> 08:25.041
It's on me.

08:25.052 --> 08:27.311
Nic. What are you doing?

08:27.321 --> 08:28.783
Don't you love this place?

08:28.794 --> 08:30.715
Wouldn't it be ironic
if we suddenly discovered

08:30.725 --> 08:31.883
we had something in common?

08:31.893 --> 08:34.719
Especially today, of all days.

08:34.729 --> 08:36.554
Okay, I'll play along.

08:36.565 --> 08:38.054
See, I have a way of never giving up

08:38.065 --> 08:39.724
when I put my mind to something.

08:39.734 --> 08:41.727
The good news is I have no distractions,

08:41.736 --> 08:43.561
so I get to focus all of my attention

08:43.571 --> 08:45.964
on one very important task.

08:45.974 --> 08:48.733
You surprise me.

08:48.743 --> 08:51.469
I didn't realize you had
so much fight in you.

08:51.479 --> 08:54.739
Too bad it didn't show up till
the week <i> after</i> you got fired.

08:54.749 --> 08:57.175
Tell me about Nashville.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.178
This conversation's over.

08:59.188 --> 09:00.612
I don't think so, Dr. Derzius.

09:00.622 --> 09:02.716
Oh, sorry, that was your married name.

09:02.727 --> 09:04.923
It took you a minute to
change back to your maiden name

09:04.934 --> 09:07.419
when you landed in Atlanta
to start over.

09:07.429 --> 09:10.450
- Let me give you a piece of advice.
- No, I'm good, thanks.

09:10.461 --> 09:13.291
I'll find out
what I need to know on my own.

09:13.301 --> 09:14.803
All of it.

09:20.231 --> 09:21.739
Don't let it shift.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.724
Did they teach you this
in medical school?

09:23.735 --> 09:28.040
No. You teach yourself
on the red route in Kandahar

09:28.050 --> 09:30.309
after an IED sends shrapnel

09:30.319 --> 09:33.111
into a soldier's head, neck and chest.

09:33.121 --> 09:34.880
Did he survive?

09:34.890 --> 09:37.181
No, he did not.

09:46.868 --> 09:49.404
We're good. You're up.

09:52.666 --> 09:53.857
How's he doing?

09:53.868 --> 09:55.938
We're about to find out.

09:59.882 --> 10:01.839
But why the hell did he jump?

10:01.849 --> 10:04.524
He didn't. He fell.

10:04.535 --> 10:05.907
We don't know what happened.

10:05.918 --> 10:08.511
We do know he's a surgeon,
and surgeons cut.

10:08.522 --> 10:10.214
But he's been benched for six weeks.

10:10.232 --> 10:13.048
I was benched for a day,
and <i> I</i> wanted to kill myself.

10:13.059 --> 10:14.735
No. Even after he was benched,

10:14.746 --> 10:16.840
he was asking everyone else
if they needed anything.

10:16.851 --> 10:20.191
This guy is strong. He's resilient.

10:20.201 --> 10:22.326
He was planning a double date
with me and Priya.

10:22.336 --> 10:25.664
- Said Noni might even be the one.
- She is not the one.

10:25.674 --> 10:28.599
The point is, he was
living and planning his life.

10:28.609 --> 10:31.203
This was not an attempted suicide.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.939
<i> Well, this was clearly
an attempted suicide.</i>

10:33.949 --> 10:37.709
And it's not our fault
that the suicide rate

10:37.719 --> 10:39.877
for male physicians is
nearly one and a half times

10:39.887 --> 10:42.013
higher than for
the general male population,

10:42.023 --> 10:44.683
or that it's the second-leading
cause of death for young doctors.

10:44.693 --> 10:48.053
28% of residents experience depression,

10:48.063 --> 10:50.689
which, left untreated,
increases the likelihood

10:50.699 --> 10:54.292
of this kind of... catastrophe.

10:54.302 --> 10:57.094
Let's be honest,
doctors don't go to therapy.

10:57.104 --> 11:00.198
Bradley sure didn't, not even
after falling asleep in the OR.

11:00.208 --> 11:03.200
That's tragic, there's no doubt.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.536
But...

11:05.546 --> 11:08.406
this was a personal decision

11:08.416 --> 11:11.487
made by a mentally unstable resident.

11:13.622 --> 11:18.116
Chastain will not be held accountable.

11:18.126 --> 11:22.587
Our insurance won't pay a dime.

11:22.597 --> 11:24.555
And...?

11:24.565 --> 11:26.167
And?

11:30.973 --> 11:32.631
And...

11:32.641 --> 11:34.766
I will make it publicly known

11:34.776 --> 11:36.334
that we want to be a leading voice

11:36.344 --> 11:38.737
and a powerful influence

11:38.747 --> 11:41.906
with an issue that plagues
hospitals nationwide.

11:41.916 --> 11:45.010
You were born to be a surgeon, Randolph,

11:45.020 --> 11:47.823
but you're a damn good CEO.

11:49.523 --> 11:51.248
- I gotta go.
- Mm-hmm.

11:51.258 --> 11:52.521
I gotta go.

11:52.532 --> 11:54.151
I gotta, I gotta go.

11:54.161 --> 11:55.700
I gotta go.

11:55.711 --> 11:58.089
Subarachnoid hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension

11:58.099 --> 11:59.216
and hydrocephalus.

11:59.227 --> 12:01.088
If we would have put Bradley
under anesthesia,

12:01.099 --> 12:02.427
he would have herniated and died.

12:02.438 --> 12:04.642
His brain is bleeding,
so if you don't get the pressure

12:04.653 --> 12:06.598
down immediately, he still will.

12:06.608 --> 12:08.834
He needs an extraventricular drain now.

12:08.844 --> 12:10.845
Let's get him to Neuro.

12:30.218 --> 12:33.044
Dr. Austin, I'm glad
you started without me.

12:33.055 --> 12:34.980
I see you're late
for your own recruitment.

12:34.990 --> 12:37.516
Forgive me, this is a hell of a morning.

12:38.571 --> 12:40.920
There are 3,200 types of bacteria

12:40.930 --> 12:44.056
from 150 species on the human hand.

12:44.066 --> 12:46.024
Let's spare ourselves
the risk of illness

12:46.034 --> 12:49.078
until we've established
a mutual respect.

12:55.744 --> 12:59.939
Dr. Bell, your reputation precedes you.

12:59.949 --> 13:02.608
That's a lie. I know nothing about you.

13:02.618 --> 13:05.011
Though I assume you are a surgeon

13:05.021 --> 13:07.846
whose passion for cutting
was snuffed out by his fondness

13:07.856 --> 13:09.849
for the good old American green.

13:09.859 --> 13:13.118
Well, in addition to my
expanded responsibilities,

13:13.128 --> 13:15.253
I'll retain the title
of Chief of Surgery.

13:15.263 --> 13:16.888
I still plan to cut.

13:16.898 --> 13:18.802
Why bother?

13:19.869 --> 13:22.228
Passion, love and discipline.

13:22.238 --> 13:24.214
This is good. You want some of my pie?

13:24.225 --> 13:26.770
You won't shake my hand, but
you're willing to share your pie?

13:26.781 --> 13:28.926
Let me rephrase that. You can
have the rest of my pie,

13:28.937 --> 13:30.802
- I'll order another one.
- No, thank you.

13:30.812 --> 13:33.104
I'm here to talk about Chastain,

13:33.114 --> 13:36.179
and how much we want you in our OR.

13:36.195 --> 13:39.144
Let's just do this as colleagues,
one great surgeon to another.

13:39.154 --> 13:41.446
Yeah, Chastain is on my list.

13:41.456 --> 13:43.081
Buried somewhere in the middle.

13:43.091 --> 13:46.786
But I do like a good underdog story.

13:46.796 --> 13:50.400
<i>Seabiscuit.</i> You like that movie?

13:51.968 --> 13:54.404
Not so much. A little vanilla for me.

14:01.911 --> 14:05.237
I'll take the tour.

14:05.247 --> 14:08.306
But I don't like smoke
anywhere near my ass.

14:13.788 --> 14:15.668
Once the cerebrospinal fluid's drained,

14:15.679 --> 14:17.115
we've got to get him to an OR stat.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.961
Yep, that's the plan.

14:21.596 --> 14:22.921
So...

14:22.931 --> 14:26.673
Bell is claiming mental illness.

14:26.684 --> 14:28.661
You need to tell me if there's
any truth to that.

14:28.671 --> 14:30.195
I know Bradley was your friend,

14:30.205 --> 14:31.596
- but...
- No.

14:31.606 --> 14:33.766
He was at the end of a 30-hour shift.

14:33.776 --> 14:36.368
But a depressed doctor
who couldn't handle the pressure

14:36.378 --> 14:39.037
and jumps off a building sounds
better than an overworked doctor

14:39.047 --> 14:41.873
- who collapsed on Bell's watch.
- Okay.

14:41.883 --> 14:44.509
Well, you know what's great
about being an internist?

14:44.519 --> 14:46.144
We get to protect patients.

14:46.154 --> 14:48.046
Which means we're gonna get
to the real reason

14:48.057 --> 14:51.743
behind Bradley's fall, no matter
what story serves our new CEO best.

15:11.479 --> 15:13.406
<i> Who is it?</i>

15:13.416 --> 15:15.840
Hi, uh, my name's Nic Nevin.

15:15.850 --> 15:17.410
I'm here to speak with Anthony Ewen.

15:17.420 --> 15:20.912
Yeah, look, I don't want any solar
panels or whatever you're selling.

15:20.922 --> 15:22.147
And I'm an atheist.

15:22.157 --> 15:23.715
You're a doctor.

15:23.725 --> 15:26.094
No, not anymore.

15:27.022 --> 15:31.195
And I'm not a nurse practitioner anymore
because of Lane Hunter.

15:34.736 --> 15:38.163
Lily Kendall. 26.

15:38.173 --> 15:40.566
She was my patient. She died recently.

15:40.576 --> 15:42.829
Because of Lane.

15:46.374 --> 15:47.865
Does Lane know you're here?

15:47.883 --> 15:50.188
No one knows I'm here.

15:52.955 --> 15:54.190
Come on.

16:05.206 --> 16:07.192
Dr. Okafor.

16:07.202 --> 16:08.893
Please, sit down.

16:08.903 --> 16:11.564
I'm about to scrub in to assist
with a mass casualty.

16:11.574 --> 16:14.365
I covered you with another resident.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.779
Which means you're now available.

16:18.647 --> 16:21.773
I would like your observations
on a recruiting matter.

16:21.783 --> 16:23.441
I'd like you to give a guest

16:23.451 --> 16:24.777
the grand tour of Chastain Park.

16:24.787 --> 16:27.322
Do I look like a welcoming committee?

16:31.726 --> 16:32.750
You hear that?

16:34.430 --> 16:37.223
That's the sound of the keys
to this castle

16:37.233 --> 16:38.968
jingling in my pocket.

16:41.003 --> 16:43.329
- Who is the guest?
- AJ Austin.

16:43.339 --> 16:45.598
Top of his class, studied
minimally invasive surgery,

16:45.608 --> 16:48.234
nominated top CT surgeon
by <i> US News & World Report</i>

16:48.244 --> 16:49.901
six times... he won four.

16:49.911 --> 16:52.070
- Fine, but why me?
- Talent recognizes talent,

16:52.080 --> 16:54.583
and his attitude leaves
a lot to be desired.

16:56.084 --> 16:59.778
Mina, uh...

16:59.788 --> 17:02.692
don't forget to smile.

17:08.964 --> 17:13.192
She was my mentor in Nashville.

17:13.202 --> 17:15.859
When rumors started about her
overtreating patients,

17:15.869 --> 17:17.996
I didn't believe it.

17:18.006 --> 17:21.833
Then one of her patients died
of chemo OD.

17:21.843 --> 17:25.204
What did the hospital do?

17:25.214 --> 17:27.939
They let her resign
in exchange for silence.

17:27.949 --> 17:30.876
So she came here with a clean slate.

17:30.886 --> 17:33.945
Then she offered me
a position at a clinic.

17:33.955 --> 17:35.714
I was loyal.

17:35.724 --> 17:39.195
But then the same thing
started happening again.

17:41.730 --> 17:44.689
This time I asked questions.

17:44.699 --> 17:47.993
Yeah, next thing I knew,
my shifts were reduced.

17:48.003 --> 17:51.397
I was accused of self-prescribing,

17:51.407 --> 17:53.398
of patient negligence.

17:53.408 --> 17:55.801
Did you ever report her
to the medical board?

17:58.147 --> 18:00.004
Are you crazy? Who is gonna believe

18:00.014 --> 18:01.407
a disgraced doctor?

18:01.417 --> 18:03.876
By then she was already building
a stellar reputation.

18:03.886 --> 18:06.878
Was anyone at the clinic on your side?

18:06.888 --> 18:09.215
I mean, what about Allie?
She's a nurse there.

18:09.225 --> 18:11.884
- I mean, if the three of us go together...
- Lady...

18:11.894 --> 18:14.552
there is no "us."

18:14.562 --> 18:19.090
The best advice I can give you is run.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.071
Run away from Lane Hunter.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.785
- Dr. Austin.
- That is the rumor.

18:33.795 --> 18:37.657
Dr. Bell pulled me from a mass casualty
to give you the royal treatment.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.559
Is that what this is?

18:39.569 --> 18:42.728
I don't know what this is.

18:48.744 --> 18:51.838
I like you already. You like me?

18:51.848 --> 18:54.674
Early days, but probably not.

18:54.684 --> 18:56.341
Well, I find your honesty off-putting.

18:56.351 --> 18:57.976
Most do.

18:57.986 --> 18:59.678
Well, let's keep it going, then.

18:59.688 --> 19:01.481
That guy. Go.

19:01.491 --> 19:04.384
Bret Kilborn. Vascular
surgery attending.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.386
- Fifth best at Chastain.
- Out of how many?

19:06.396 --> 19:09.088
Five.

19:09.098 --> 19:11.823
Redhead. Man hips. Go.

19:11.833 --> 19:14.827
Joyce. Orthopedics. Average at best.

19:14.837 --> 19:16.428
Bitchy.

19:16.438 --> 19:17.616
Why are we doing this?

19:17.627 --> 19:19.444
Well, if I'm gonna come to Chastain,

19:19.455 --> 19:21.833
I need to know how many clowns
are in the circus.

19:21.843 --> 19:23.467
I'm already accredited here.

19:23.478 --> 19:25.733
- I'm sure you know.
- Are you going to come?

19:25.744 --> 19:28.396
Not likely.

19:31.662 --> 19:34.389
He... Hey. Where you going?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.137
Pre-op on a patient with a broken penis.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.554
<i> Devon...</i>

19:42.564 --> 19:44.057
what are you doing?

19:44.067 --> 19:46.426
Same as you, trying to figure out.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.427
Bradley's last moments.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.762
What really happened.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.365
What the hell was he doing up here?

19:52.375 --> 19:54.734
Our lounge sucks. Look around.

19:54.744 --> 19:56.636
This is where a lot
of us interns hang out.

19:56.646 --> 19:58.737
Particularly the ones
addicted to nicotine.

19:58.747 --> 20:00.540
Wait, Bradley smoked?

20:00.550 --> 20:01.940
Every doctor has some sort of vice

20:01.950 --> 20:05.582
to survive the pressures, the hours.

20:05.593 --> 20:08.152
This isn't gonna lead to some
weird admission from you, is it?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.446
Look, all I'm saying is
I'm sure you've got a poison,

20:10.457 --> 20:11.484
just like Bradley.

20:11.494 --> 20:13.115
And that's probably why he was up here.

20:13.126 --> 20:16.299
Yeah, you're right, I do, but I get
my aggressions out in my own way.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.728
It doesn't end with me
crashing through the skylight.

20:21.599 --> 20:23.428
Wasn't that Bradley's drink of choice?

20:23.438 --> 20:27.000
Yeah. Anything to stay awake.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.600
Why would he care about staying awake

20:28.610 --> 20:31.771
if he was planning on jumping
to his own death?

20:31.781 --> 20:33.517
He wouldn't.

20:40.356 --> 20:42.281
Excuse me, ma'am.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.783
I'm sorry, but your appointment
has been cancelled.

20:44.793 --> 20:48.082
Uh, I've been waiting
for over half an hour,

20:48.093 --> 20:49.856
and my appointment
was scheduled on Tuesday.

20:49.866 --> 20:51.803
Denise is a former colleague of mine.

20:51.814 --> 20:54.055
- She would have called in advance.
- Something came up.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.194
So sorry she forgot to call.

20:55.204 --> 20:57.089
The way that our calendar system works,

20:57.100 --> 20:58.764
- it's really hard...
- Denise.

20:58.774 --> 21:00.256
Hey, Denise.

21:01.809 --> 21:04.467
Ma'am? Ma'am!

21:04.478 --> 21:06.505
Unfortunately,
we are booked for the day,

21:06.515 --> 21:08.440
But if you'd like to make
another appointment,

21:08.450 --> 21:10.208
you can call and reschedule.

21:10.218 --> 21:12.011
You do realize I'm not
just here to hang out

21:12.021 --> 21:13.646
and catch up with old friends, right?

21:13.656 --> 21:15.380
I'm actually here at the medical board

21:15.390 --> 21:18.184
to report someone who's
putting patients in danger.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.552
You know, the patients?
The ones we're supposed to help?

21:20.562 --> 21:22.803
Do you care at all about anything?

21:22.814 --> 21:24.624
You know, don't answer that.
I'll be back.

21:27.169 --> 21:29.339
You suck.

21:30.907 --> 21:33.699
Wow. Oh, this is my lucky day.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.801
Wait, is, uh, is that good news for me?

21:35.811 --> 21:37.637
No. It's a penile fracture.

21:37.647 --> 21:38.670
That baby's broken.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.574
But it-it doesn't even have a bone.

21:42.584 --> 21:45.544
It's a membrane called
the tunica albuguinea.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.012
Look, Doc, this is my thingy
we're talking about here.

21:48.023 --> 21:49.647
Oh, we're not talking about it anymore.

21:49.658 --> 21:50.750
I'm booking an OR.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.385
Wait, surgery? Whoa.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.919
Look, it's a little crooked.

21:53.929 --> 21:55.888
I can-I can live with that.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.522
"A little."

21:57.532 --> 21:59.591
Steve, tell me how you did this.

22:01.704 --> 22:04.030
- I-I just... not...
- Use your words, Steve.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.698
Well, I had to, uh...

22:06.708 --> 22:09.267
I had a wild night with a-with a lady.

22:09.277 --> 22:11.070
I mean, uh... a girl.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.938
- But she... It was a woman.
- Steve,

22:12.948 --> 22:14.840
do you really want to lie to the people

22:14.850 --> 22:17.577
who are going to have sharp
knives next to your thingy?

22:17.587 --> 22:19.779
I thought she was doing
the surgery. Who <i> is</i> this guy?

22:19.789 --> 22:22.281
Hey! Are you gonna
help us help you or not?

22:22.291 --> 22:23.894
I have a tee time.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.519
Okay, that's a lie.

22:26.529 --> 22:28.454
I have a date with a single malt.

22:28.464 --> 22:30.255
Now, Steve.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.224
Are you going to tell me what happened,

22:32.234 --> 22:35.437
so we can save the only partner
who seems to want to have sex with you?

22:35.448 --> 22:38.562
It wasn't from coitus
with a human person.

22:38.573 --> 22:40.899
I'll stay for this.

22:40.909 --> 22:43.101
You did this yourself, didn't you?

22:43.111 --> 22:44.593
How?

22:45.648 --> 22:47.607
An elliptical machine.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.407
Uh, he asked how.

22:49.417 --> 22:51.811
That is how.

22:51.821 --> 22:56.381
I was working out,
and I was watching pornography.

22:56.391 --> 22:58.417
You did this in public?

22:58.427 --> 23:00.418
No, it was at home.

23:00.428 --> 23:03.455
I mean, I also own
a-a used Pilates reformer

23:03.465 --> 23:04.657
and gravity boots.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.892
Uh, gravity boots?

23:06.902 --> 23:08.160
Yeah, those are new.

23:08.170 --> 23:10.295
What do you have to live for, Steve?

23:10.305 --> 23:12.732
What makes you rise and shine
in the morning?

23:12.742 --> 23:14.567
What fills your lungs with air?

23:14.577 --> 23:17.169
My... my cats?

23:17.179 --> 23:18.503
I have seven.

23:18.513 --> 23:20.585
I like kitties.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.576
I've always been a cat man.

23:23.586 --> 23:25.677
Dogs like everybody.

23:25.687 --> 23:27.446
But cats are more discerning.

23:27.456 --> 23:28.657
Exactly.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.185
I wanted to know how you did this

23:32.195 --> 23:35.454
so I could scare you into never
doing something this stupid again,

23:35.464 --> 23:37.089
because the next time,

23:37.099 --> 23:40.525
you could snap your neck
and not your thingy.

23:40.535 --> 23:41.994
And you will die.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.196
And then, three days later,

23:44.206 --> 23:47.177
guess who's gonna starve and die
right next to your corpse?

23:49.212 --> 23:51.102
My kitties. They...

23:51.112 --> 23:52.938
They're all I have.

23:52.948 --> 23:54.206
That's right.

23:54.216 --> 23:56.208
There's only the eight of you.

23:56.218 --> 23:59.544
Now, we are going to fix your thingy,

23:59.554 --> 24:03.014
and then we're gonna find you
another, safer fetish.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.884
Yeah.

24:04.894 --> 24:06.696
- Thanks, Doc.
- Don't touch me.

24:14.136 --> 24:16.294
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?

24:16.304 --> 24:17.463
Is he in pain?

24:17.473 --> 24:18.664
Uh, he's deeply sedated.

24:18.674 --> 24:19.732
He doesn't feel anything.

24:19.742 --> 24:21.300
Uh, how did this even happen?

24:21.310 --> 24:23.301
Our son would never try to kill himself.

24:23.311 --> 24:24.736
I don't believe he did.

24:24.746 --> 24:26.914
We're still working on answering
a lot of questions.

24:26.925 --> 24:28.674
But Bradley was
a deeply dedicated member...

24:28.684 --> 24:30.208
You don't need to sugarcoat it.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.902
We know he was struggling.

24:31.913 --> 24:34.086
Bradley was always one
of those kids who had to work

24:34.097 --> 24:35.961
twice as hard as everyone else.

24:35.972 --> 24:37.344
But he would never

24:37.355 --> 24:39.289
- I mean...
- Don't take this the wrong way.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.555
We love our son.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.889
We wanted him to be happy,
but he put a lot of pressure on himself.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.590
Wanted to be like his big sister.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.761
She's at the Cleveland clinic.
A natural-born doctor.

24:49.644 --> 24:53.510
Maybe if we told Bradley
how proud we are of him, no matter what.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.881
He's a good person.

25:00.116 --> 25:02.440
He's got a good heart, you know?

25:02.450 --> 25:04.894
Trust me, we all know that.

25:06.003 --> 25:09.115
If Bradley ends up being
okay, what happens to him?

25:09.125 --> 25:11.216
Is his career over?

25:12.128 --> 25:13.718
I don't know.

25:13.728 --> 25:16.755
Well, if it is, he'll be just fine.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.425
We'll... help him get through it.

25:19.435 --> 25:22.772
D-Dr. Okafor?

25:34.716 --> 25:38.377
Promise us that he's gonna be okay.

25:38.387 --> 25:40.756
Surgeons don't make promises.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.486
But I'll make an exception.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.659
<i> Timeout is now complete
for Bradley Jenkins.</i>

26:36.669 --> 26:39.896
<i>Let the record show
Dr. AJ Austin observing.</i>

26:39.906 --> 26:42.998
The impalement injured the left
pulmonary vein near the bronchus.

26:43.008 --> 26:45.368
Okay. Let's get him on cardiac bypass.

26:45.378 --> 26:47.137
Whoa. Bypass?

26:47.147 --> 26:49.854
I guess that's the way
a trauma surgeon thinks.

26:49.865 --> 26:51.975
But, you know, you wouldn't need
a bypass if you knew

26:51.985 --> 26:53.810
how to do heart surgery like me.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.135
What'd you just say to me?

26:56.146 --> 26:58.314
- I said kill your resident.
- So you think it's better

26:58.324 --> 27:00.538
to get in there, dig around without
being able to see what's going on?

27:00.549 --> 27:03.463
What do I know?
I'm only a cardiothoracic surgeon.

27:03.474 --> 27:05.237
Mina, do you have an opinion on this?

27:05.248 --> 27:06.855
Oh, whoa, whoa, you're asking

27:06.865 --> 27:08.525
your resident for confirmation?

27:08.535 --> 27:10.759
Dawg, you are the attending.

27:10.769 --> 27:12.929
Theoretically, if you move fast enough,

27:12.939 --> 27:15.164
you don't need bypass.

27:16.342 --> 27:18.567
See? Princess Nokia gets it.

27:18.577 --> 27:20.035
Let me show you.

27:20.045 --> 27:22.048
Nurse, headlight.

27:23.248 --> 27:24.573
I said I need a headlight.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.508
I'm sorry,

27:26.518 --> 27:28.010
is English not your first language?

27:28.020 --> 27:30.779
Or maybe I need to speak slowly.

27:30.789 --> 27:32.863
- I said...
- This is my team.

27:32.874 --> 27:35.529
You will not talk to them like this.

27:37.729 --> 27:39.522
Fine.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.024
Give him his headlamp.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.793
My apologies to the group.

27:43.803 --> 27:47.296
I don't know what came over me.

27:47.306 --> 27:51.400
No... I really, really shouldn't
have raised my voice.

27:51.410 --> 27:53.969
Thank you.

27:53.979 --> 27:56.773
But it's not like this is a matter

27:56.783 --> 27:59.775
of life and death!

27:59.785 --> 28:01.788
After you, Doctor.

28:05.991 --> 28:08.761
By all means.

28:10.497 --> 28:13.223
This is only because
you're cardiothoracic.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.757
Yeah, whatever you have
to tell yourself, pal.

28:15.767 --> 28:18.961
Yo, why don't you load up a, uh,

28:18.971 --> 28:22.064
5-0 Prolene on a BV-1 needle?

28:22.074 --> 28:24.003
- Today, Dr. Okafor.
- Listen,

28:24.014 --> 28:25.767
I've treated people
wounded in civil wars

28:25.777 --> 28:27.303
and children dying of AIDS.

28:27.313 --> 28:28.804
None of that scared me.

28:28.814 --> 28:32.175
So you definitely don't scare me.

28:32.185 --> 28:34.310
Now, speak to me with respect,

28:34.320 --> 28:36.495
Dawg.

28:39.613 --> 28:42.418
Fine. Suture.

28:42.428 --> 28:45.354
Now, do you think you can
yank the impalement out

28:45.364 --> 28:47.366
so we can get to work?

28:50.303 --> 28:51.472
He's hemorrhaging.

28:52.872 --> 28:54.807
Retract medially. Suction.

28:55.708 --> 28:57.100
Come on, keep up.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.767
- Keep up!
- He's losing blood.

28:58.777 --> 29:00.434
Pressure's dropping.
Two units, wide open.

29:00.445 --> 29:01.871
Another suture. Now.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.776
Increase my suction.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.195
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, keep up.

29:20.033 --> 29:22.725
Will you look at that?

29:22.735 --> 29:24.694
Bleeding's stopped.

29:24.704 --> 29:26.161
- Vessel's repaired.
- Oh.

29:26.171 --> 29:28.131
Piece of cake.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.798
Wow.

29:29.808 --> 29:32.134
That bleeding
was nothing but a distraction.

29:32.144 --> 29:34.680
Now we can look for other injuries.

29:37.049 --> 29:39.808
Left ventricle severely thickened.

29:39.818 --> 29:41.577
He has heart disease.

29:41.587 --> 29:43.212
In his 30s?

29:43.222 --> 29:46.626
Not that we knew of.

29:46.637 --> 29:48.685
The medical board doesn't
make scheduling errors.

29:48.695 --> 29:50.510
And Denise just blew me off.

29:50.521 --> 29:53.188
It was weird. And I think
someone's following me.

29:53.199 --> 29:54.756
- Wait, what?
- There was this car

29:54.766 --> 29:57.160
waiting for me outside
the board, to box me in.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.495
- It freaked me out.
- Okay, I'm done with this whole

29:59.505 --> 30:01.831
"I'll handle Chastain, you
handle the investigation" thing.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.234
Please, don't do anything else
until my shift ends,

30:04.244 --> 30:05.689
and we'll come up with a game plan.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.603
Rumors travel fast around here.

30:07.613 --> 30:09.171
Nic Nevin?

30:09.181 --> 30:10.840
On the grounds of Chastain.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.275
Ballsy.

30:12.285 --> 30:14.171
She heard about Bradley
and wanted to visit him.

30:14.182 --> 30:17.112
No need to explain to me. It's not
like I'm gonna call security.

30:17.122 --> 30:18.781
Someone else might, but not me.

30:18.791 --> 30:21.261
So let them.

30:24.697 --> 30:27.034
Have a nice day.

30:31.150 --> 30:33.528
Ventricular hypertrophy? From what?

30:33.538 --> 30:34.838
Don't know yet.

30:34.849 --> 30:37.265
Combination of cigarettes
and obesity, mixed with

30:37.276 --> 30:39.635
a heavy dose of stress,
would be my educated guess.

30:39.645 --> 30:41.271
Obesity?

30:41.281 --> 30:44.039
I noticed stretch marks
around his gut during surgery.

30:44.049 --> 30:46.476
Telltale signs of a man
who's had gastric bypass.

30:46.486 --> 30:48.710
Um, I'm sorry,
I don't believe we've met.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.880
- Mina, is this...?
- Dr. Austin.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.247
And he is?

30:52.257 --> 30:54.750
Dr. Devon Pravesh.

30:54.760 --> 30:58.598
Top intern at Chastain,
and it's not even close.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.256
Stop smiling.

31:01.266 --> 31:03.603
And don't wink.

31:04.836 --> 31:07.095
Dr. Conrad Hawkins.

31:07.105 --> 31:09.231
I've heard some things.

31:09.241 --> 31:11.266
But it's cool.

31:11.276 --> 31:14.102
I'm sure you've heard
some things about me, too.

31:14.112 --> 31:16.805
I'm Dr. AJ Austin in the flesh.

31:16.815 --> 31:19.275
I assisted in Bradley's surgery.

31:19.285 --> 31:20.743
The plan was to observe,

31:20.753 --> 31:22.512
but I ended up working with Dr. Okafor,

31:22.522 --> 31:24.680
because the cretin masquerading

31:24.690 --> 31:27.182
as a trauma surgeon really ought
to bury his scalpel,

31:27.192 --> 31:31.131
along with his career,
in an unmarked grave.

31:39.267 --> 31:41.270
Can I borrow you two for a second?

31:44.343 --> 31:46.335
<i> Toxicology on Bradley's back.</i>

31:46.345 --> 31:48.170
Amphetamines in his system.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.441
And security found
methylphenidate in his locker.

31:50.452 --> 31:51.539
Uppers.

31:51.550 --> 31:53.843
Stimulants were his crutch
to work in overdrive.

31:53.853 --> 31:55.844
- And it's what damaged his heart.
- Yeah,

31:55.854 --> 31:57.947
but there's no proof
that his heart caused the fall.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.216
Which means Bell will still
sell this as a suicide.

32:00.226 --> 32:04.219
Unless a little controlled chaos
helps us figure out

32:04.229 --> 32:07.156
what actually happened
to Bradley on that roof.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.690
Mm. You're smiling?

32:08.700 --> 32:11.727
Keep me out of it.

32:11.737 --> 32:13.462
You in?

32:13.472 --> 32:14.996
Do I have a choice?

32:15.006 --> 32:16.476
No.

32:21.951 --> 32:23.309
Wait, his rhythm is normal.

32:23.319 --> 32:25.443
Why am I getting ready
to cardiovert him?

32:25.454 --> 32:29.214
I'm pushing isoproterenol to mimic
the cardiac effects of caffeine.

32:29.224 --> 32:31.783
Wait a second, are you trying
to induce an abnormal rhythm?

32:31.793 --> 32:33.452
- Because that would be...
- Yes.

32:33.462 --> 32:34.912
I am.

32:34.923 --> 32:37.889
I think that energy drink
in Bradley's system

32:37.899 --> 32:39.891
triggered something
in his already damaged heart

32:39.901 --> 32:42.127
and caused him to faint and
crash through that skylight.

32:42.137 --> 32:43.728
And this little experiment

32:43.738 --> 32:46.365
is gonna prove if I'm right or not.

32:48.510 --> 32:52.003
He's in V tach. He's gonna crash.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.072
- I'm paging Code Blue.
- Relax.

32:54.082 --> 32:56.742
There's our answer. Okay? Paddles.

32:56.752 --> 32:58.614
Yeah.

33:03.595 --> 33:05.665
Charge. Clear.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.424
Back in sinus. See?

33:12.434 --> 33:14.926
Controlled chaos to test our theory.

33:14.936 --> 33:16.720
Exciting, right? Everybody wins.

33:16.731 --> 33:18.579
Except Bell. Proves that he didn't jump.

33:18.590 --> 33:20.748
Wean him off the vent
and page me when he's awake.

33:22.603 --> 33:25.576
The guy is a gross liability.
He does not belong at Chastain.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.295
Dr. Nolan is just filling me in

33:27.306 --> 33:29.474
- on what happened in the OR.
- You were there.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.865
You saw the way that
that animal treated everybody.

33:31.876 --> 33:34.001
Mostly you, but yes.

33:34.011 --> 33:36.738
Dr. Okafor, you spent
the whole shift with Dr. Austin.

33:36.748 --> 33:37.985
What are your observations?

33:37.996 --> 33:40.555
His bedside manner is a disaster.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.821
Think about who's saying that.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.647
Sorry.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.884
But in the OR,
his hands, his instincts...

33:48.894 --> 33:50.852
unlike anything I've seen before.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.656
And, ultimately, he saved Bradley's life

33:54.666 --> 33:57.259
without even having to expose
him to the risks of bypass.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.056
He's cardiothoracic, all right?

33:59.067 --> 34:01.230
I put my ego aside for the patient.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.364
Other surgeons might not
be able to handle Dr. Austin

34:03.374 --> 34:04.767
with that type of modesty.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.268
- Am I done here?
- No.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.770
In your opinion,

34:07.780 --> 34:09.498
would Dr. Austin be a valuable addition

34:09.510 --> 34:11.540
- to Chastain's surgical staff?
- Absolutely not.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.819
Albert.

34:14.663 --> 34:15.675
Mina.

34:16.741 --> 34:19.447
Even a raptor serves a purpose,

34:19.458 --> 34:21.449
as long as you know it's a raptor.

34:21.458 --> 34:25.020
Keep Austin away
from conscious patients.

34:25.030 --> 34:28.034
Unconscious ones will love him
because he'll save their lives.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.304
- Raptor.
- We're done.

34:39.311 --> 34:42.203
Hey. Dr. Austin.

34:42.213 --> 34:46.408
- So, how's my, uh...
- Your penis is as good as new.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.710
Oh, thank God.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.980
That's amazing.

34:52.989 --> 34:54.783
Give me your password.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.317
What?

34:56.327 --> 34:59.065
Hey, how'd you get my ph... Why?

35:01.333 --> 35:06.338
6-9-6-9.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.337
There's my kitties.

35:15.347 --> 35:18.573
Take care of your babies, okay?

35:18.583 --> 35:22.009
And I want you to see this face...

35:22.019 --> 35:24.346
this face right here...

35:24.356 --> 35:26.948
before you think
about doing something stupid

35:26.958 --> 35:29.618
on a treadmill again.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.920
Do you hear me, Steve?

35:32.930 --> 35:35.367
Yes, sir.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.939
Good.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.306
Can I help you?

35:52.316 --> 35:54.964
Oh. Howdy there.

35:54.975 --> 35:58.043
Um, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm just delivering your groceries.

35:58.054 --> 36:00.855
Uh, well, I didn't order any groceries.
You must have the wrong house.

36:00.866 --> 36:02.951
Oh, golly. Really? I'm sorry.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.786
I... No, it...

36:05.796 --> 36:08.323
No, it says this exact address
right here.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.560
Don't want to go wasting
free groceries, now, do we?

36:18.075 --> 36:19.701
Well, now, say thank you.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.969
Excuse me?

36:21.979 --> 36:24.006
Oh, this is the part
where one nice person

36:24.016 --> 36:25.506
says to another nice person,

36:25.516 --> 36:27.203
"Hey, thanks for the free groceries."

36:27.214 --> 36:29.344
If you don't get off my property
I'm gonna call the police.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.513
Hey, hey, now. Ain't no need to go
turning something perfectly pleasant

36:32.523 --> 36:33.982
into something else.

36:33.992 --> 36:35.984
How about we just move on with our lives

36:35.994 --> 36:37.553
and stop looking to cause trouble?

36:37.563 --> 36:40.087
That way we can both sleep tight

36:40.097 --> 36:43.101
and nobody gets hurt.

36:46.604 --> 36:49.208
You have a good night, Nicolette Nevin.

37:07.595 --> 37:10.788
I am so sorry, you guys.

37:10.798 --> 37:12.352
I was just trying to push through.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.255
You know? Just act
like everything was okay.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.992
That's kind of what we do, right?

37:16.003 --> 37:18.844
We don't put patients in danger.

37:19.977 --> 37:21.657
Or doctors.

37:21.668 --> 37:23.485
Or ourselves.

37:25.606 --> 37:26.993
Okay.

37:29.150 --> 37:31.203
So, is that it then?

37:32.391 --> 37:33.611
Am I done?

37:33.621 --> 37:35.356
Bradley, what do you want?

37:39.693 --> 37:42.351
Everyone in this room would answer
that question in a split second

37:42.362 --> 37:43.739
and say, "I want to be a
doctor." But why didn't you?

37:43.750 --> 37:46.317
No, I do. I-I do want to be a doctor.

37:46.328 --> 37:49.794
Don't tell me what you think the right
answer is. Tell me what you want.

37:51.387 --> 37:53.342
I don't know, man.

38:00.347 --> 38:02.717
Look, I...

38:05.933 --> 38:10.506
I never thought that I would
admit this to anyone.

38:12.726 --> 38:15.458
But I thought about it all the time.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.022
Not falling through the skylight

38:19.032 --> 38:21.658
on Bell's conference table, per Se,

38:21.668 --> 38:23.393
but...

38:25.173 --> 38:28.510
I thought about stepping
off that rooftop.

38:32.746 --> 38:34.973
I just...

38:34.983 --> 38:37.808
wanted to escape the pressure...

38:39.208 --> 38:41.301
anxiety...

38:41.734 --> 38:43.966
the exhaustion...

38:44.230 --> 38:46.588
the fear of...

38:47.427 --> 38:49.325
fear of failing again...

38:51.100 --> 38:53.255
of being a failure.

38:58.215 --> 39:00.981
Even just the thought...

39:02.010 --> 39:05.213
of walking away from medicine...

39:08.282 --> 39:11.586
brings this overwhelming
sense of relief.

39:13.755 --> 39:16.258
It's like a weight
lifted off my shoulders.

39:18.793 --> 39:22.097
Is that weird or what?

39:24.097 --> 39:26.823
- To me it is.
- Incomprehensible.

39:26.834 --> 39:30.027
But for you, it's not weird at all,
because you don't love being a doctor,

39:30.037 --> 39:31.612
so go.

39:33.691 --> 39:37.445
Get out of this place
and find what you do love.

39:41.816 --> 39:43.819
Yeah, and...

39:45.552 --> 39:46.917
Well...

39:48.055 --> 39:51.382
I am not going to miss this place.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.081
But I am definitely...

39:56.395 --> 39:58.167
definitely...

39:59.143 --> 40:01.814
gonna miss you guys.

40:05.638 --> 40:07.130
We're gonna miss you, too, man.

40:07.141 --> 40:08.899
You know where to find us.

40:08.909 --> 40:11.902
Yeah, you guys seriously
never leave this place.

40:11.912 --> 40:14.471
Hey, thumbs up, man.

40:14.481 --> 40:15.839
- Dude, yeah.
- Good, good.

40:15.849 --> 40:17.975
I think this is...

40:20.287 --> 40:22.480
Not one for good-byes?

40:22.490 --> 40:24.649
Love them, actually.

40:24.659 --> 40:26.316
Good-bye.

40:26.327 --> 40:28.185
I'm willing to offer you
a full-time position.

40:28.195 --> 40:30.087
Yeah, what's the number?

40:30.097 --> 40:32.757
Well, more than anyone else will
pay, less than you'll demand.

40:32.767 --> 40:34.456
I'll pass.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.327
Dr. Austin, I know a great surgeon

40:37.338 --> 40:40.765
when I see one, but...

40:40.775 --> 40:42.766
I also know a desperate man.

40:42.776 --> 40:45.870
You've been a locum tenens
for the last 36 months,

40:45.880 --> 40:47.871
hopping from hospital to hospital,

40:47.881 --> 40:49.339
searching for something,

40:49.349 --> 40:53.044
- maybe running from something.
- I only run when being chased.

40:53.816 --> 40:55.331
Okay.

40:56.490 --> 41:01.118
Well, your reputation outside
the OR is catching up.

41:01.128 --> 41:06.024
You know, great hospitals have
a profound aversion to risk,

41:06.034 --> 41:08.525
but I'm willing to bet two things:

41:08.535 --> 41:10.795
one, on you,

41:10.805 --> 41:14.164
and two, that your list of suitors

41:14.175 --> 41:16.199
is neither long nor impressive.

41:17.784 --> 41:19.803
You'll have an offer
from me in the morning.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.983
It's a best and final.

41:27.409 --> 41:30.480
Dr. Okafor frightens me

41:30.490 --> 41:33.583
in wonderful ways.

41:34.558 --> 41:37.087
I want her to be my right hand.

41:38.237 --> 41:40.501
My thoughts exactly.

42:06.526 --> 42:08.685
- Hey.
- Did he come back again?

42:08.695 --> 42:10.754
No. Not yet.

42:10.764 --> 42:13.925
- How about his license plate?
- It was dark. I couldn't see it.

42:13.936 --> 42:16.847
- I just ran in the house and locked the door.
- Did you call the police?

42:16.858 --> 42:19.326
And say what? That some
creepy guy gave me groceries?

42:19.337 --> 42:21.731
No, no, that's okay.
I just, I know what you're gonna say,

42:21.742 --> 42:23.478
that you're fine
and you don't need my help.

42:23.489 --> 42:25.870
No, I am not fine
and I do need your help.

42:26.934 --> 42:30.401
I'm just starting to realize
how far Lane's willing to go.

42:30.717 --> 42:33.076
Grab your things.
You're staying at my place.

42:33.086 --> 42:35.693
- Just until we figure this out.
- Yeah.

42:39.342 --> 42:41.319
I mean, she already got me fired.

42:41.329 --> 42:43.553
I thought she was
just trying to ruin <i> me.</i>

42:43.563 --> 42:45.693
But it's not that simple.
Think about it, Conrad.

42:45.704 --> 42:49.030
This isn't just about Lily or me.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.067
It's bigger than that.

42:51.471 --> 42:53.256
Lane has got something else to hide.

42:53.267 --> 42:55.443
And we're gonna find out
what it is together.
