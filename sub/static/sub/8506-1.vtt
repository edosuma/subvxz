while the rest of you

21:14.529 --> 21:16.095
are coming with me to find
Professor Boardman.

21:16.097 --> 21:17.863
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

21:17.865 --> 21:20.366
- You're benching us?
- I thought we were a team.

21:20.368 --> 21:21.567
This mission doesn't require
your particular skill set.

21:21.569 --> 21:23.302
Yet.

21:23.304 --> 21:25.771
Meaning you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

21:25.773 --> 21:27.173
Precisely.

21:27.175 --> 21:28.307
Sure it's a good idea
to leave these two

21:28.309 --> 21:29.842
unsupervised on a time machine?

21:29.844 --> 21:31.243
Hey, haircut!

21:31.245 --> 21:33.145
Deafness wasn't
one of the side effects.

21:33.147 --> 21:34.246
We better hurry up.
Professor Boardman will die

21:34.248 --> 21:35.714
in less than 24 hours.

21:35.716 --> 21:37.049
What's the point in
cutting it so close?

21:37.051 --> 21:38.717
Because if he's
destined to die,

21:38.719 --> 21:40.719
then he doesn't have a timeline
for us to disrupt,

21:40.721 --> 21:43.222
and his impact on the future
will be minimal.

21:43.224 --> 21:44.423
How brilliant.

21:44.425 --> 21:45.624
And depressing.

21:45.626 --> 21:46.959
How does he die?

21:46.961 --> 21:48.961
Uh, he's found dead
in his university

21:48.963 --> 21:51.197
from unknown causes.
Come on.

21:51.199 --> 21:54.100
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay put.

21:54.102 --> 21:55.935
You'd rather stay with them?

21:55.937 --> 21:57.236
They didn't drug me.

22:46.354 --> 22:47.653
Ever since, as a child,

22:47.655 --> 22:49.788
I first heard the story
of Chay-Ara,

22:49.790 --> 22:52.224
High Priestess of Horus,
the Hawk God,

22:52.226 --> 22:54.093
and her lover, Price Khufu.

22:54.095 --> 22:58.230
I hoped and prayed
this day might come.

22:58.232 --> 23:00.833
Well, then, looks like
we've come to the right place.

23:00.835 --> 23:02.535
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

23:02.537 --> 23:04.136
A fellow historian,

23:04.138 --> 23:06.939
here to discuss
another passion of yours:

23:06.941 --> 23:10.276
Vandal Savage.

23:10.278 --> 23:11.810
There's no way
of telling your story

23:11.812 --> 23:15.114
without telling his also.

23:15.116 --> 23:18.117
<i>[cheers and applause]</i>

23:18.119 --> 23:19.952
<i>Okay...</i>

23:19.954 --> 23:23.255
Why does this stupid station
play nothing but reruns?

23:23.257 --> 23:25.324
Don't even bother
trying to explain.

23:25.326 --> 23:28.194
Am I the only one on this ship
who could really use a drink?

23:28.196 --> 23:31.297
I say we go get weird
in the '70s.

23:31.299 --> 23:32.798
Excellent idea.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.767
I got the perfect outfit.

23:34.769 --> 23:36.702
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
was unclear</i>

23:36.704 --> 23:38.671
<i>with his instructions
to remain onboard.</i>

23:38.673 --> 23:40.306
Shut it, metal mouth.

23:40.308 --> 23:42.975
Oh, you're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

23:42.977 --> 23:44.510
Sorry, kid.

23:44.512 --> 23:46.145
Wait, you're just gonna
leave me here?

23:46.147 --> 23:48.581
I said I'd take care of you.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.650
4,000 years ago,

23:51.652 --> 23:54.320
Vandal Savage was
an Egyptian priest,

23:54.322 --> 23:57.256
secretly in love
with a priestess.

23:57.258 --> 23:58.891
You.

23:58.893 --> 24:00.459
Or, rather,

24:00.461 --> 24:02.595
you in your first life.

24:04.098 --> 24:07.199
<i>But you were
in love with another.</i>

24:07.201 --> 24:09.568
<i>Prince Khufu.</i>

24:09.570 --> 24:12.805
<i>Savage, or Hath-Set
as he was then known,</i>

24:12.807 --> 24:14.807
<i>learned of the affair
and was consumed</i>

24:14.809 --> 24:16.942
<i>with jealous rage.</i>

24:16.944 --> 24:18.711
You believe me yet?

24:18.713 --> 24:22.047
Which drove him
to murder you both.

24:25.753 --> 24:27.653
<i>And prayed for the hawk god,
Horus,</i>

24:27.655 --> 24:32.124
<i>to damn the objects of his hate
for all eternity.</i>

24:33.561 --> 24:35.294
But Chay-Ara had
a prayer of her own,

24:35.296 --> 24:37.596
that Horus would
protect them forever.

24:37.598 --> 24:40.399
But another life was
bound to theirs by accident.

24:40.401 --> 24:41.734
Savage's.

24:41.736 --> 24:43.869
That's why
he wants us both dead.

24:43.871 --> 24:45.371
My theory is that
the three of you

24:45.373 --> 24:47.706
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

24:47.708 --> 24:49.375
We all share the same power.

24:49.377 --> 24:51.377
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

24:51.379 --> 24:53.379
That's what maintains
his immortality.

24:53.381 --> 24:54.947
That's impossible.

24:54.949 --> 24:57.249
Unless the meteorites
contained a mutative element,

24:57.251 --> 24:59.385
like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

24:59.387 --> 25:00.953
But without evidence,
you're asking us

25:00.955 --> 25:02.054
to take you at your word?

25:02.056 --> 25:03.322
It's not my word.

25:03.324 --> 25:04.623
It's theirs.

25:04.625 --> 25:09.094
But you still don't remember me,
do you?

25:09.096 --> 25:12.264
We knew you in our past lives.

25:14.402 --> 25:15.934
You've told me
your entire story,

25:15.936 --> 25:18.137
stretching back
through the ages,

25:18.139 --> 25:19.405
but when I first knew you,

25:19.407 --> 25:22.675
it was after World War I,

25:22.677 --> 25:25.577
and your names were
Joe and Edith.

25:25.579 --> 25:27.713
Edith Boardman.

25:27.715 --> 25:31.483
Wait, I... we were related?

25:32.920 --> 25:36.322
I don't remember you.
I'm so sorry.

25:36.324 --> 25:37.723
Don't be.

25:37.725 --> 25:39.925
You always warned me
that if I ran into you

25:39.927 --> 25:41.393
in your next life,

25:41.395 --> 25:44.029
you might have forgotten me.

25:44.031 --> 25:46.398
That's us

25:46.400 --> 25:49.935
at the World's Fair.

25:52.807 --> 25:57.810
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

25:59.647 --> 26:02.815
Mother.

26:10.037 --> 26:11.603
How old were you when...

26:11.605 --> 26:14.439
You two were murdered?

26:14.441 --> 26:16.341
Ten.

26:16.343 --> 26:17.943
My whole life, you taught me
to be careful,

26:17.945 --> 26:19.344
to keep moving,

26:19.346 --> 26:21.179
always one step ahead of Savage,

26:21.181 --> 26:23.648
but after tracking you
for 4,000 years,

26:23.650 --> 26:25.350
he'd gotten good.

26:25.352 --> 26:27.219
He found us
in the middle of the night

26:27.221 --> 26:30.589
at a fleabag motel
in North Carolina.

26:30.591 --> 26:32.424
You hid me in the closet,

26:32.426 --> 26:34.759
made me promise that
no matter what I heard,

26:34.761 --> 26:38.363
I'd stay put.

26:38.365 --> 26:40.899
And I did.

26:40.901 --> 26:43.401
Sorry to interrupt
your family time,

26:43.403 --> 26:45.003
but we were hoping you could
tell us a bit more

26:45.005 --> 26:48.440
where to locate
Savage's present whereabouts.

26:51.078 --> 26:53.044
He hides in the shadows,

26:53.046 --> 26:56.448
never drawing
too much attention,

26:56.450 --> 26:57.816
but every lifetime,

26:57.818 --> 27:00.452
placing himself near
the seat of power,

27:00.454 --> 27:03.722
sowing seeds of destruction.

27:03.724 --> 27:05.357
Who remembers
the name of the man

27:05.359 --> 27:08.426
who whispered in the ear
of Gavrilo Princip,

27:08.428 --> 27:12.197
and convinced him to start
World War I?

27:12.199 --> 27:13.932
Why?
What does he get out of that?

27:13.934 --> 27:16.067
The more the world is focused
on destroying itself,

27:16.069 --> 27:19.738
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

27:19.740 --> 27:24.509
With the ultimate goal of
subjugating the entire planet.

27:24.511 --> 27:28.313
He killed your parents,
Professor Boardman.

27:28.315 --> 27:32.484
Something tells me you know
where to locate Vandal Savage.

42:26.306 --> 42:28.039
is that many things
cannot be changed.

42:28.041 --> 42:29.674
Time wants to happen.

42:29.676 --> 42:33.211
Chronos, even Vandal, won't be
the only enemy we face.

42:33.213 --> 42:36.647
Very often, it will be
time itself.

42:36.649 --> 42:38.182
Whether it wants to happen
or not,

42:38.184 --> 42:39.250
we're gonna change time,

42:39.252 --> 42:40.651
erase Savage's future,

42:40.653 --> 42:42.520
and earn our rightful place
in history.

42:42.522 --> 42:43.955
Dr. Palmer is correct.

42:43.957 --> 42:45.857
We may not be legends
in your time, Captain,

42:45.859 --> 42:49.794
but we are going to decide
our own fates.

42:49.796 --> 42:52.130
I don't give a damn about
being a legend,

42:52.132 --> 42:54.999
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

42:55.001 --> 42:57.135
I can get down with that.

42:57.137 --> 42:59.137
And our malcontents?

42:59.139 --> 43:00.705
I like killing people.

43:00.707 --> 43:02.306
We're in.

43:02.308 --> 43:04.242
For now.

43:05.378 --> 43:07.311
So how do we find this guy?

43:07.313 --> 43:09.914
Professor Boardman had
a theory about that.

43:09.916 --> 43:12.150
I've already had Gideon
plot a course.

43:12.152 --> 43:14.352
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

43:15.698 --> 43:19.097
_

43:22.829 --> 43:26.397
You know what this is?

43:26.399 --> 43:30.301
An instrument to make this world
a better place.

43:30.303 --> 43:33.171
History teaches us
that the cause of humanity

43:33.173 --> 43:36.474
is only advanced through strife.

43:36.476 --> 43:40.311
There's no Renaissance without
the Dark Ages.

43:40.313 --> 43:43.214
Man had no interest
in splitting the atom

43:43.216 --> 43:46.284
until World War II.

43:49.222 --> 43:50.655
I'm just trying

43:50.657 --> 43:54.692
to make this world
a better place,

43:54.694 --> 43:57.361
one war at a time.
