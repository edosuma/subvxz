09:19.820 --> 09:21.952
I don't have time
to be one of them.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.563
- You better find the time

09:23.606 --> 09:25.739
before you run out of it.

09:29.743 --> 09:30.134
.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.746
- One of the valves
that controls the flow of blood

09:32.789 --> 09:34.399
through Jozette's heart
is broken,

09:34.443 --> 09:35.531
and blood is backing up
into her lungs,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.359
which is why she can't breathe.

09:37.402 --> 09:40.275
- But how could this happen?
Jozette is strong.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.712
She's an aid worker
for the people of Haiti.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.584
- I have to get to Jean-Rabel.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.238
- This week, a mudslide
hit our village.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.763
So many people have died.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.373
- That might explain
what happened.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.766
- You thinking
takotsubo syndrome?

09:52.809 --> 09:53.767
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:53.810 --> 09:54.855
- That sounds bad.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.073
- Another name for it

09:56.117 --> 09:57.640
is, uh, broken heart syndrome.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.295
The mudslide may have caused
Jozette so much grief

10:00.338 --> 10:02.427
that it actually made
her heart beat so hard that

10:02.471 --> 10:04.516
it tore the muscles
that hold it together.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.431
- I hate to feel helpless.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.737
- I'm sorry.
[cell phone buzzes]

10:07.781 --> 10:09.304
- Well, the good news is,

10:09.347 --> 10:11.175
I can fix a broken heart.

10:11.219 --> 10:12.655
Now, we're gonna get you
prepped for surgery

10:12.699 --> 10:14.614
and get you home
as fast as we can.

10:15.919 --> 10:19.227
- First may we perform
a Gad Ko?

10:19.270 --> 10:20.402
- I'm sorry, a what?

10:20.445 --> 10:22.622
- It's a protection ritual.

10:22.665 --> 10:25.450
We make a cut in the skin,
rub in herbs.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.104
- Oh, no, that's out
of the question.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.759
Any cuts to the skin
can introduce infection, so...

10:29.803 --> 10:32.283
- Gad Ko attaches
Lwa to me.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.285
Protects me from accidents.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.678
- Okay, look, Jozette,

10:35.722 --> 10:37.549
there won't be any accidents,
all right?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.160
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:39.203 --> 10:41.423
I have to prep for surgery.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.257
- It's true.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.652
He used to be energetic.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.175
Silly.
- Yeah.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.742
- But you--you can't just

10:55.785 --> 10:57.874
take him off of all
of his medications.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.181
Doesn't he need them?
- Honestly, I don't know.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.791
I don't know what he needs.
He's on so many

11:01.835 --> 11:04.794
counterintuitive drugs,
I can't see the real issue.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.753
I want to try
behavioral therapy.

11:06.796 --> 11:07.884
Talk therapy.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.887
- He had, um...

11:10.931 --> 11:13.760
outbursts at school--
physical.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.500
And when the school
psychiatrist

11:15.544 --> 11:17.720
started him on the zotepine,
they completely stopped.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.157
- That drug may have succeeded
in curbing your son's behavior,

11:20.201 --> 11:22.594
but it did nothing to address
the underlying issues.

11:22.638 --> 11:25.641
- Zotepine also causes
lethargy, apathy.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.338
So when he was
prescribed a stimulant,

11:27.382 --> 11:28.775
that led to his sleep issues.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.341
- And accelerated
his weight gain,

11:30.385 --> 11:32.387
which developed into
Type 2 diabetes.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.562
- That's why he's
wetting the bed.

11:33.605 --> 11:34.955
He has diabetes...

11:34.998 --> 11:38.393
because of the drugs
that he's on.

11:38.436 --> 11:39.655
- My God, I didn't...

11:39.699 --> 11:40.874
I didn't know.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.614
I mean, they told me
that he needed them.

11:42.658 --> 11:43.964
I was just--I was trying
to help him.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.487
- Of course you were.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.488
That's what we all
would have done.

11:46.531 --> 11:47.707
- Yes, absolutely.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.883
I'm sorry, I just...
[clears throat]

11:49.926 --> 11:52.712
Let me pull him off the meds.

11:52.755 --> 11:53.887
You know, let me talk to him.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.889
I really just want
to talk to him.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.896
When was the last time
you saw your son smile?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.556
- Dora, are you stalking me?

12:11.600 --> 12:14.255
- It's definitely beginning
to feel that way, isn't it?

12:14.298 --> 12:15.299
Dr. Sharpe's office called.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.344
- I got pulled into OB.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.388
- Tell that to Dr. Sharpe.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.955
I got you an apple.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.827
- You know, I'm really more
of a Golden Russet kind of guy.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.350
- Maybe keep that to yourself.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.655
- What do you have against
Golden Russets?

12:23.699 --> 12:24.831
- Nothing, my issue
is with people

12:24.874 --> 12:26.006
who can identify
Golden Russets.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.616
- Dr. Reynolds.
- What up?

12:27.659 --> 12:29.270
- Now eat the apple.
- Got you an apple.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.446
Uh, also, I got a call from
Jozette Pampil's family?

12:31.489 --> 12:32.708
Apparently they're upset
that you won't let them

12:32.752 --> 12:34.754
perform some kind of
protection ritual?

12:34.797 --> 12:36.320
- That's correct.
- Even though they believe

12:36.364 --> 12:38.758
it's gonna help keep
your patient safe from harm?

12:38.801 --> 12:40.803
- You fired the entire
cardiac surgical department

12:40.847 --> 12:42.544
because of the high
infection rates,

12:42.587 --> 12:44.546
and now you want me to let
a family member

12:44.589 --> 12:46.853
cut open my patient
and put dirt in her wound?

12:46.896 --> 12:48.811
- Well, a superficial wound
with a sterile blade

12:48.855 --> 12:51.422
under your supervision.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.338
- Is this my call,
or are you overstepping me?

12:54.382 --> 12:55.862
- It's your call.
- Good.

12:55.905 --> 12:59.300
Then no one's cutting open
my patient but me, okay?

13:00.692 --> 13:02.259
Hello.
- She's ready to go.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.957
- All right. Wow.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.698
Expeditions to the North Pole
traveled lighter, huh?

13:09.963 --> 13:13.488
[alarms beeping]

13:13.531 --> 13:15.664
- Looks like V-fib.

13:15.707 --> 13:18.362
- There's no pulse.
- Defibrillator.

13:18.406 --> 13:19.929
- 200 joules.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.717
- All clear.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.632
[machine jolts]

13:27.676 --> 13:31.071
[alarms continue beeping]

13:31.114 --> 13:32.942
[monitor beeping steadily]

13:32.986 --> 13:34.335
Okay, got her back.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.815
- I'll back off the Levophed.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.077
That should stabilize her.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.601
- You're good?
- Yeah.

13:41.429 --> 13:42.822
Whew.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.521
[alarms beeping]

13:46.564 --> 13:47.870
- Back in V-fib!

13:50.525 --> 13:52.875
- I don't have a pulse.
- Let's go 300.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.530
[alarms continue beeping]

13:55.573 --> 13:57.967
- All clear.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.839
[machine jolts]

13:59.882 --> 14:02.493
[alarms continue beeping]

14:02.537 --> 14:04.844
Okay, I got her back.

14:04.887 --> 14:05.888
What the hell?

14:05.932 --> 14:08.891
[monitor beeping steadily]

14:08.935 --> 14:12.025
- She's too unstable
for transport.

14:12.068 --> 14:15.071
- Maybe you should
do the ritual.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.598
- Because Leo is on
multiple medications,

14:20.642 --> 14:21.948
we must devise a regimented
detox program.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.688
- Mm-hmm.

14:23.732 --> 14:24.864
- The stimulant should leave
his system overnight,

14:24.907 --> 14:26.822
but the psychoactive
medication

14:26.866 --> 14:29.433
will require
gradual tapering.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.695
What, you don't agree?

14:30.739 --> 14:32.697
- No, no, I do. I do.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.917
Just, um, for whatever
it's worth,

14:34.961 --> 14:36.397
I think you would have made
a really good dad.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.702
- No, I wouldn't have.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.356
- Why do you say
these crazy things?

14:39.400 --> 14:40.967
- A word, you two?
- Let me ask you something.

14:41.010 --> 14:42.011
Don't you think Kapoor
would have made,

14:42.055 --> 14:43.839
like, a totally rad dad?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.146
- Uh, Dr. Villarreal, this is--
- Look at this dad face.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.844
- This--hey!
This is Dr. Kapoor,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.628
head of our
neurology department,

14:50.672 --> 14:52.456
and this is Dr. Frome,
head of our psych department.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.110
Gentlemen, this is
Dr. Villarreal.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.026
She's the psychiatrist for all
the public schools in Queens.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.941
- Including Leo Chen's.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.900
His mother alerted me
to the changes

15:00.943 --> 15:02.553
you're making to his treatment.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.991
- Yes, we were just discussing
his detox schedule.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.906
- Well, you should know
that if Leo Chen

15:06.949 --> 15:08.777
stops taking his medication,

15:08.820 --> 15:11.606
he'll no longer be admitted
back into his school

15:11.649 --> 15:14.174
or, for that matter,
any New York public school.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.958
- I'm sorry,
how can you force a child

15:16.002 --> 15:17.090
to take medication?

15:17.133 --> 15:18.918
- Easy, it's the law.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.009
- Prohibition on Mandatory
Medication Amendment.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.924
It passed in 2004.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.621
It is illegal
for public schools

15:26.664 --> 15:28.101
to force a student to take
a controlled substance

15:28.144 --> 15:29.145
to attend class.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.625
- Unless the mother signed

15:30.668 --> 15:32.061
an Individualized
Education Plan

15:32.105 --> 15:33.541
agreeing to the medication.

15:33.584 --> 15:34.803
- She did?
- It's right there.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.544
- Not only are
these medications

15:36.587 --> 15:37.893
causing Leo physical harm,
but nobody has studied

15:37.937 --> 15:39.677
their long-term
side effects, also.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.897
- Well, the school board
doesn't seem to agree with you.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.638
- Max, I can get through
to this kid, just not

15:43.681 --> 15:45.727
with all the drugs in the way.
- Okay, okay.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.468
You really feel
that you can help this kid?

15:47.511 --> 15:49.078
- I do.
- And you think you can

15:49.122 --> 15:51.863
wean him off the drugs safely?
- He does.

15:51.907 --> 15:53.735
What? You gotta talk faster.
- I do.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.867
- Then present your evidence
to a judge.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.043
If you believe this is
the best thing

15:57.086 --> 15:58.783
for your patient,
prove it.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.960
Take the New York
public school system to court.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.488
- This pacing wire
should get her stable

16:07.531 --> 16:08.968
long enough to get her
to the OR.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.100
- Or you could do the ritual.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.624
- If I believed in rituals,
I would have become a shaman,

16:13.668 --> 16:15.713
not a surgeon.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.628
- You're about to fix
her heart valve.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.195
If I were you, I'd take
all the help I could get.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.196
- You know,

16:20.240 --> 16:21.719
if a patient feels like

16:21.763 --> 16:24.200
they've got to chant
or knock on wood

16:24.244 --> 16:27.638
or get their prayer warrior
to lay hands on them

16:27.682 --> 16:28.988
before I operate,
then that means

16:29.031 --> 16:30.641
they don't trust me,
you know?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.034
They don't have faith
in my abilities.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.646
[monitors beeping steadily]

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
- Normal paced rhythm
with capture.

16:37.257 --> 16:40.173
- See? Pacing wire
is all the faith I need.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.655
[alarms beeping]

16:44.699 --> 16:49.095
- [gasps]
- O2 sats are falling!

16:49.138 --> 16:51.010
- Jozette, I'm gonna sit you up
so you can breathe.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.665
- [gasping]

16:54.709 --> 16:55.840
I hear rales.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.755
- Edema?
- Backing up in her lungs

16:57.799 --> 16:59.496
because of that valve.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.933
Here, toss me the furosemide.
- I'm already on it.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.588
[alarms continue beeping]

17:04.632 --> 17:06.155
You know, that's gonna take
a while to dry out her lungs.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.201
- Well, I can't operate

17:08.244 --> 17:10.029
until I get this under control.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.552
- So then maybe you do
the ritual.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.163
- Don't.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.991
Don't even say it.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.559
[monitor beeping steadily]

17:18.602 --> 17:20.039
- Okay, look, uh,

17:20.082 --> 17:21.823
the ritual isn't even
about you

17:21.866 --> 17:23.042
or what you believe

17:23.085 --> 17:24.086
or your abilities.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.174
It's about her.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.219
It's about what she believes,

17:26.262 --> 17:27.220
what she needs.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.699
I mean...

17:28.743 --> 17:30.788
why can't you just
give her that?

17:33.922 --> 17:35.097
- So, Millie,

17:35.141 --> 17:36.185
I've read your file.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.144
- [chuckles]
Not so good, huh?

17:38.187 --> 17:40.711
- Well, your chemotherapy
hasn't been as effective

17:40.755 --> 17:43.018
as everyone hoped.
