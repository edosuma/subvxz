[police officer speaking]

00:14.514 --> 00:15.981
[narrator]<i> A brutal murder...</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:18.650
I'm just praying,
"Please don't let it be her,

00:18.752 --> 00:20.319
please don't let it be her."

00:20.387 --> 00:22.421
[narrator]<i> ...leaves a family</i>
<i>in despair.</i>

00:23.990 --> 00:26.091
<i>A gunman on the loose.</i>

00:26.192 --> 00:29.595
He was on the run.
He's a danger to the public.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.630
[narrator]<i> A shocking trail</i>
<i>of evidence...</i>

00:31.731 --> 00:33.232
Stop, rewind on that.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.004
[narrator]<i> ...is the only way</i>
<i>to find a killer.</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:42.307
We've just seen the murder
of Jennifer occur

00:43.476 --> 00:44.476
<i>before our eyes.</i>

[theme music playing]

01:15.075 --> 01:18.377
[narrator]<i> Thirty-year-old, Jennifer
Krajnak, is planning a night out</i>

01:18.478 --> 01:21.013
<i>at nearby Dirk's Bar
with her friends.</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:25.284
Jennifer was extremely sociable.

01:25.385 --> 01:30.122
She had everyone from the bar
on mass text messages.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.091
She used to love to
send them out to all of us,

01:32.192 --> 01:33.659
you know, "Happy holidays."

01:35.228 --> 01:37.529
[narrator]<i> Jennifer</i>
<i>is currently out of work,</i>

01:37.630 --> 01:41.100
<i>but she's hoping to be
accepted into coroner school.</i>

01:41.201 --> 01:43.869
She wanted to make something
for herself

01:43.970 --> 01:45.671
and to help her family out.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.107
<i>She was very driven like that.</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:49.508
<i>It was part of her personality.</i>

01:51.511 --> 01:53.445
I love all my kids,

01:54.747 --> 01:56.815
but I don't know,
she was my only daughter,

01:56.916 --> 02:00.185
it was just different from
what I have with my boys.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.488
Hi, Joey.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.922
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

02:04.023 --> 02:05.057
Hey, happy new year.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.191
Is Mom there?

02:07.193 --> 02:09.361
I didn't feel good that day

02:09.462 --> 02:11.830
and I spent most of the day
in bed.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.099
No, sorry,
she's just lying down.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.802
Fine. I guess I have to
talk to you then.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.804
[chuckles]
How's my favorite brother?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.038
[Joseph]<i> We were pretty close.</i>

02:20.140 --> 02:21.440
We would do
a lot of stuff together.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.009
We used to go everywhere
together.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.379
I'm good.
How's my little big sister?

02:27.480 --> 02:31.016
We used to always call
Jennifer our little older sister,

02:31.117 --> 02:33.719
because she was always
so much smaller than us.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.722
[chuckles] Hey,
watch yourself, big guy.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.023
She could mess with us,

02:38.124 --> 02:40.526
but she would not let
other people mess with us.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.995
<i>She was a really protective
big sister.</i>

02:43.096 --> 02:44.496
Is Mom okay?

02:44.597 --> 02:46.565
Yeah. She just told me
to tell you if you call

02:46.666 --> 02:48.333
that she loves you
and be careful.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.868
She just has
a bit of a headache.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.738
[Gale]<i> I say that</i>
<i>to all my children.</i>

02:52.839 --> 02:54.406
Anytime they're leaving
the house,

02:54.507 --> 02:56.842
it's "Be careful, I love you."

02:56.943 --> 03:00.145
Tell her to feel better,
and not to worry.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.080
All right. Have a good
night, sis. Love you.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.115
[Jennifer] Love you both.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.819
[Clyde]<i> She was very loving.</i>
<i>She was very kind.</i>

03:07.921 --> 03:10.589
She treated everybody
as if they were family.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.934
[Hubbert] <i>Just after 2:00 a.m.,</i>

03:22.035 --> 03:24.703
<i>Deputy Bunk,
who's on Pacific Avenue,</i>

03:24.804 --> 03:27.372
he observed a person
lying on the ground.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.108
<i>As he exits his vehicle,</i>

03:30.210 --> 03:32.277
<i>he observes a female</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:35.714
<i>with an apparent gunshot wound
to the head.</i>

03:35.815 --> 03:39.418
The female is still alive,
but unable to speak.

03:39.519 --> 03:40.552
[Bunk speaking]

03:40.954 --> 03:41.687

04:06.312 --> 04:07.846
[siren wailing]

04:10.516 --> 04:13.619
[Hubbert]<i> Numerous deputies</i>
<i>were on the crime scene,</i>

04:13.720 --> 04:16.255
<i>a mixed residential
and commercial area.</i>

04:17.890 --> 04:20.359
<i>I observed a large amount
of blood,</i>

04:23.062 --> 04:24.529
<i>as well as a purse,</i>

04:24.631 --> 04:29.201
<i>and found identification in
the name of Jennifer Krajnak.</i>

04:29.302 --> 04:33.071
[DuGal]<i> Near her body, there
were vehicle keys, a cell phone,</i>

04:33.172 --> 04:35.607
<i>and an electronic tablet.</i>

04:35.708 --> 04:38.310
Robbery was likely not a motive

04:38.411 --> 04:39.978
<i>from the initial investigation.</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:44.049
<i>[Hubbert] Within feet
of Jennifer's body,</i>

04:44.150 --> 04:47.853
<i>a 9-millimeter
brass cartridge case</i>

04:47.954 --> 04:50.389
<i>is located in the roadway.</i>

04:55.795 --> 04:56.828
It's all we've got.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.565
I need you to do a search

05:00.667 --> 05:02.834
through the victim's
tablet and cell phone.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.803
I'll call forensics.

05:04.904 --> 05:08.340
[DuGal]<i> We collect the
electronic items as evidence,</i>

05:08.441 --> 05:09.775
then we write a search warrant

05:09.876 --> 05:12.711
to get into
those electronic items.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.314
We forensically look at them
to determine

05:15.415 --> 05:17.282
who was the last person
they called,

05:17.383 --> 05:19.151
what text messages happened.

05:20.286 --> 05:23.622
<i>We send out deputies
to knock on everybody's door</i>

05:23.723 --> 05:26.024
who may have seen
or heard something.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.560
[Hubbert]
<i>Several individuals reported</i>

05:28.661 --> 05:31.029
<i>that they heard gunshots
early that morning,</i>

05:31.130 --> 05:33.565
but did not see anything
out of the ordinary.

05:35.868 --> 05:39.071
<i>The Olive Tree Apartments are
located south of the roadway</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:40.639
<i>where Jennifer was found.</i>

05:42.308 --> 05:44.409
<i>I observed a surveillance camera</i>

05:44.510 --> 05:46.645
<i>that pointed towards
the crime scene.</i>

05:46.746 --> 05:49.081
We hope that the camera
captured the shooting.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.652
[narrator]<i> Hubbert</i>
<i>crosses over Pacific Avenue</i>

05:53.753 --> 05:58.523
<i>and faces the loading bay
of a large retail store, GTM.</i>

05:58.624 --> 06:01.727
[Hubbert]<i> The GTM store</i>
<i>has 12 cameras</i>

06:01.828 --> 06:03.228
<i>located around the building.</i>

06:06.299 --> 06:09.301
<i>Four of the cameras appeared
to be pointed in the direction</i>

06:09.402 --> 06:10.769
<i>where Jennifer was found.</i>

06:11.971 --> 06:14.172
<i>The surveillance
could have information</i>

06:14.273 --> 06:16.174
that leads us to a suspect.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.877
We need to contact
the GTM's security office

06:18.978 --> 06:20.579
and download all their footage.

06:22.448 --> 06:23.749
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

06:37.964 --> 06:42.801
<i>Jennifer is declared deceased
at Scripps Mercy Hospital.</i>

06:44.270 --> 06:46.605
[narrator]<i> The case</i>
<i>is now a homicide.</i>

06:48.574 --> 06:51.276
[DuGal]<i> The suspect in
this case has the time to flee,</i>

06:51.377 --> 06:53.678
<i>and that's a big concern
of ours.</i>

06:53.746 --> 06:55.680
We don't know what
the motive was.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.650
<i>We don't know how dangerous
he is to the rest of the public,</i>

06:58.751 --> 07:01.286

as quickly as possible.

- <i> Jennifer Krajnak.</i>
- Hubbert.

07:09.061 --> 07:12.664
[Hubbert]<i> We find that</i>
<i>she is a protected person</i>

07:12.765 --> 07:15.767
with a restraining order

07:15.868 --> 07:17.636
<i>who was an ex-fiance.</i>

07:17.737 --> 07:20.572
Detective Hubbert
assigned me immediately

07:20.673 --> 07:23.975
<i>to reach out and interview
the ex-fiance,</i>

07:24.076 --> 07:26.077
as he was now
a person of interest.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.648
Yes, this is Detective DuGal of
the San Diego Sheriff's Department,

07:29.749 --> 07:32.651
requesting you come in
for questioning, regarding...

07:32.752 --> 07:34.486
<i>We needed to find out
where he was</i>

07:34.587 --> 07:36.888
and make sure he wasn't
a potential suspect.

07:38.057 --> 07:41.927
He also wanted me to
immediately go contact Dirk's

07:42.028 --> 07:45.063
<i>and potentially find
surveillance video, if they had it.</i>

07:50.470 --> 07:52.204
<i>As I entered the nightclub,</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:54.840
<i>I saw more cameras
that would be able to see</i>

07:54.941 --> 07:57.742
<i>if Jennifer was in there,
who she intermixed with,</i>

07:57.844 --> 07:59.878
<i>potential witnesses

08:01.914 --> 08:03.482
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hey.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.084
Yeah, do you know a woman
by the name of Jennifer Krajnak?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.520
Jen, yeah, yeah.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.589
[DuGal]<i> He was</i>
<i>on duty that night.</i>

08:10.690 --> 08:12.457
<i>One of the patrons
that he noticed</i>

08:12.558 --> 08:13.959
was Jennifer Krajnak.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.461
Shot?

08:16.562 --> 08:18.930
She previously had
worked at that nightclub.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.434
How many more cameras
do you have in this place?

08:22.535 --> 08:24.536
We have eight inside
and there's one on the exit.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.572
Okay, well, I'd like to see
some video surveillance.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.142
I'm looking for any indication
that Jennifer Krajnak

08:31.244 --> 08:33.812
is going to be on the interior
surveillance cameras.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.947
Quick, go to around 6:00 p.m.

08:49.462 --> 08:53.098
[DuGal]<i> I'm hoping that I see</i>
<i>Jennifer walking into the bar,</i>

08:53.633 --> 08:54.900
and who she may be with.

08:58.404 --> 09:01.172
There's a small group of
persons sitting at the bar...

09:03.142 --> 09:04.543
Stop, zoom in.

09:06.946 --> 09:07.946
Is that her?

09:08.047 --> 09:10.148
[DuGal]<i> One man is</i>
<i>fairly large in stature,</i>

09:10.249 --> 09:13.218
<i>and then there's a smaller
person just beyond him</i>

09:13.319 --> 09:15.086
<i>at the corner of the bar,</i>

09:15.187 --> 09:17.522
<i>and it looks like
Jennifer Krajnak.</i>

09:26.599 --> 09:29.334
[DuGal]<i> I have</i>
<i>some reasonable belief that</i>

09:29.435 --> 09:32.671
<i>that may be Jennifer sitting
at the corner of the bar.</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:35.206
I think so, yeah.

09:37.209 --> 09:38.410
[DuGal] Definitely looks
like her.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.279
Try camera one.

09:50.823 --> 09:54.759
I see a young female
wearing a gray hoodie,

09:54.860 --> 09:57.796
very defined ponytails
on either side of her head.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.030
- Freeze that.
- [clicks on keyboard]

09:59.131 --> 09:59.898
Let's zoom in.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.269
[DuGal]<i> That's Jennifer Krajnak.</i>

10:06.439 --> 10:09.641
<i>She's chatting with what
appears to be another couple.</i>

10:09.742 --> 10:11.910
They're having a good time,
the female's on her left,

10:12.011 --> 10:14.646
the male on the right
in a checked shirt.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.281
Everything looked very normal.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.754
<i>I'm looking at mannerisms,
behavior of the victim,</i>

10:22.855 --> 10:25.457
<i>potential witnesses,
potential suspects,</i>

10:25.558 --> 10:27.792
<i>to see if behavior changes
at any moment.</i>

10:34.767 --> 10:36.067
<i>There's a man in a dark shirt</i>

10:36.168 --> 10:37.902
<i>who comes from
the pool table area</i>

10:38.004 --> 10:40.038
<i>to the girl I now believe
is Jennifer.</i>

10:43.709 --> 10:45.243
He leans very close to her

10:45.311 --> 10:47.412
and has some communication
with her.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.115
<i>It looks natural.</i>

10:50.216 --> 10:52.584
She's in a good mood,
he's in a good mood.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.754
<i>But just because
there's no conflict</i>

10:55.855 --> 10:58.423
<i>doesn't mean that the person
she communicated with</i>

10:58.524 --> 10:59.658
<i>wasn't the suspect.</i>

11:00.826 --> 11:03.628
<i>Each one of those moments
has a potential lead</i>

11:03.729 --> 11:05.997
<i>to what happens
in the next few hours</i>

11:06.098 --> 11:07.565
<i>when Jennifer is found dead.</i>

11:14.807 --> 11:16.307
[phone ringing]

11:16.409 --> 11:17.609
[Gale]<i> My friend, Rose,</i>
<i>called me</i>

11:17.710 --> 11:19.477
<i>just after 8:00 in the morning.</i>

11:19.945 --> 11:21.179
Hello?

11:21.280 --> 11:24.916
Rose kept asking me,
"Gale, are you sitting down?"

11:25.017 --> 11:26.618
No, I'm making breakfast.

11:26.719 --> 11:27.752
<i>I knew...</i>

11:27.853 --> 11:28.753
Why?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.922
...it had something
to do with Jennifer.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.023
What's... What's the matter?

11:32.124 --> 11:34.459
And I just yelled in the phone.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.094
Just tell me what happened
to Jennifer!

11:38.064 --> 11:39.798
[Joseph]<i> I'm, like,</i>
<i>"Something's wrong,"</i>

11:39.899 --> 11:43.168
and I just instantly
got the blood pumping.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.670
And he was like,
"What happened to my sister?"

11:45.771 --> 11:47.939
<i>- And he started trying to call her.</i>
- [line ringing]

11:50.509 --> 11:55.346
Rose said that they had, uh,
found somebody there

11:55.448 --> 11:58.183
on the edge of the street
in Lemon Grove

11:58.284 --> 12:01.052
and that they thought
it was my daughter.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.787
- Where are your brothers?
- I don't know.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.255
- Where are your brothers?
- I don't know!

12:04.790 --> 12:05.757
And so,

12:07.326 --> 12:08.827
we went over there.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.463
I walked right under
the yellow tape.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.065
I'm just praying,
"Please don't let it be her,

12:14.166 --> 12:15.366
please don't let it be her."

12:16.836 --> 12:20.605
<i>I don't remember what exactly
he told me other than,</i>

12:21.340 --> 12:22.941
yes, it was my daughter.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.279
[Hubbert]<i> We told her</i>
<i>the unfortunate news</i>

12:28.981 --> 12:30.749
that Jennifer was deceased.

12:34.620 --> 12:37.322
Was there anyone in particular
she was close with?

12:38.124 --> 12:40.358
Not since the ex-fiance.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.563
Okay.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.634
[narrator]<i> Ex-fiance, Lee
Crowell, is also at the crime scene.</i>

12:52.104 --> 12:54.439
Thank you. Thank you.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.508
Mr. Crowell,
would you mind sticking around

12:56.609 --> 12:58.610
and answering some questions
for us?

12:58.711 --> 12:59.944
- Of course, yes.
- Thank you.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.112
Whatever I can do to help you.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.220
Okay, let's continue.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.997
[DuGal]<i> During the
surveillance video analysis,</i>

13:19.098 --> 13:22.300
<i>we noticed that there was
a heavier-set man</i>

13:22.401 --> 13:24.803
<i>in dark clothing
with a dark ball cap,</i>

13:24.870 --> 13:26.771
<i>who spent a considerable
amount of time</i>

13:26.872 --> 13:28.940
<i>seated next to Jennifer.</i>

13:29.041 --> 13:30.708
<i>They had lots of communication.</i>

13:32.778 --> 13:33.778
Let's rewind that.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.388
<i>Everything looks normal,</i>

13:43.489 --> 13:46.791
<i>looks like conversation I might
have with another person, a friend.</i>

13:47.393 --> 13:48.593
<i>There was no intimacy.</i>

13:48.694 --> 13:50.128
<i>There was nothing
that led me to believe</i>

13:50.229 --> 13:52.597
<i>that they were
anything more than friends.</i>

13:53.265 --> 13:54.365
<i>But I'm looking for anything</i>

13:54.466 --> 13:56.768
<i>that is troubling,
or that changes.</i>

14:06.579 --> 14:07.812
Zoom in on that tablet.

14:14.954 --> 14:15.687
Play on.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.927
<i>Jennifer is
paging through the tablet</i>

14:23.028 --> 14:24.429
<i>and showing him something.</i>

14:24.930 --> 14:25.797
Stop there.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.501
Okay, let's continue.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.831
He walks away from the bar,

14:59.932 --> 15:01.633
out of the view of that camera.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.839
<i>Jennifer gets up and she goes
in the same direction as the man.</i>

15:08.974 --> 15:10.808
<i>There's no indication
that they're leaving,</i>

15:10.910 --> 15:14.012
<i>or that she's leaving, because
her purse is left behind.</i>

15:15.547 --> 15:16.414
Where have they gone?

15:17.783 --> 15:18.783
<i>I tried to track them</i>

15:18.884 --> 15:21.286
<i>on other surveillance video
in the bar.</i>

15:21.387 --> 15:23.421
There was no coverage
for this specific area,

15:23.522 --> 15:24.656
I couldn't tell where they went,

15:24.757 --> 15:26.958
I couldn't tell
what was going on.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.660
Let's go back to
the camera at the bar.

15:56.588 --> 15:57.422
Okay, rewind.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.728
<i>She's looking at the tablet.</i>

16:03.829 --> 16:06.230
<i>The same man in dark clothing
with the dark ball cap</i>

16:06.332 --> 16:07.565
<i>comes in</i>

16:07.666 --> 16:08.800
<i>and he's looking at her.</i>

16:09.735 --> 16:11.135
<i>She's not looking up at him</i>

16:11.236 --> 16:13.371
<i>and he tries
to communicate with her,</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:15.373
<i>it doesn't appear
she's communicating back</i>

16:15.474 --> 16:17.008
<i>and he turns and walks away.</i>

16:18.677 --> 16:19.944
And he waves her off.

16:22.581 --> 16:23.915
Let's see
what that guy does again.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.459
<i>It's definitely a red flag.</i>

16:34.560 --> 16:36.527
I have no idea
what they've said.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.863
<i>I don't know what
the conflict is,</i>

16:38.964 --> 16:42.567
<i>but it's abnormal compared to
all the previous video</i>

16:42.668 --> 16:44.969
<i>that I've been watching
of their interactions.</i>

16:45.070 --> 16:46.337
<i>So something changed,</i>

16:46.438 --> 16:49.307
<i>something in their relationship
that moment changed.</i>

16:50.709 --> 16:52.010
Okay, let's see if he leaves.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.487
<i>There's a patron in the bar
who exits.</i>

17:06.959 --> 17:09.093
<i>And a very short time later,</i>

17:09.194 --> 17:11.696
<i>the man in the dark clothing
with the dark ball cap</i>

17:11.797 --> 17:14.532
that was seated next
to Jennifer also exits bar.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.067
Switch to the exterior camera.

17:19.638 --> 17:20.405
Rewind.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.009
Have you seen this guy before?

17:26.078 --> 17:27.678
I think his name might be Casey.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.481
[DuGal]<i> At this point,</i>
<i>I had no idea</i>

17:30.582 --> 17:32.350
<i>if he was just
a person of interest</i>

17:32.451 --> 17:33.985
or if he was going to
end up being a suspect.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.820
[cell phone ringing]

17:35.921 --> 17:37.488
[narrator]<i> Meantime,</i>
<i>Detective Hubbert</i>

17:37.589 --> 17:40.091
<i>sends Jennifer's ex-fiance,
Lee Crowell,</i>

17:40.192 --> 17:42.527
<i>into the bar
for a formal interview.</i>

17:43.295 --> 17:44.262
I'll go meet him now.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.965
So, Lee Crowell becomes
our first lead.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.035
[Lee speaking]

18:06.018 --> 18:07.652
One of the important factors was

18:07.753 --> 18:10.555
the fact that there was this
temporary restraining order against him

18:10.656 --> 18:12.623
<i>protecting Jennifer from him.</i>

18:13.225 --> 18:14.058
[Lee speaking]

18:17.396 --> 18:19.030
[narrator]<i> That's a kind of</i>
<i>restraining order</i>

18:19.131 --> 18:21.432
<i>that allows the parties
to be together,</i>

18:21.500 --> 18:22.733
<i>if they stay friendly.</i>

18:26.271 --> 18:27.371
[Lee speaking]

18:27.473 --> 18:29.640
They fell apart at the end
of their relationship

18:29.741 --> 18:30.842
and things were strained,

18:30.943 --> 18:33.578
that's when the restraining
order was taken out.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.714
<i>Subsequently,
they had become friends again.</i>

18:36.815 --> 18:38.716
He had actually texted
her the very night

18:38.817 --> 18:39.650
she was murdered.

18:41.153 --> 18:44.222
[narrator]<i> DuGal shows him</i>
<i>the man from the CCTV.</i>

18:47.059 --> 18:47.758
[Lee speaking]

18:48.961 --> 18:49.594
[DuGal speaking]

18:49.695 --> 18:50.528
[Lee speaking]

18:56.535 --> 18:59.704
[DuGal]<i> We learned quickly</i>
<i>that Toyo had a girlfriend</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:01.372
<i>and her name was Krystal,</i>

19:01.473 --> 19:04.408
and she was a very good friend
of Jennifer.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.912
<i>I knew I needed to find
this Toyo and interview him.</i>

19:13.585 --> 19:14.285
[Lee speaking]

19:17.322 --> 19:18.890
[DuGal] He goes by
the name of Toyo,

19:18.991 --> 19:21.926
but his real name
is Custodio Ramirez.

19:25.731 --> 19:28.132
Okay, can we go back to
the camera at the bar?

19:36.275 --> 19:40.178
[DuGal]<i> After he's gone, she goes
back to a very normal mannerism.</i>

19:40.279 --> 19:43.581
<i>She's jovial, she's
interacting with other people.</i>

19:43.682 --> 19:46.417
<i>She's hugging
the bartender goodbye.</i>

19:46.518 --> 19:50.421
<i>It's only 20 minutes before
somebody is going to murder her.</i>

19:50.522 --> 19:52.857
<i>She looks happy
and life is normal.</i>

19:52.958 --> 19:53.991
<i>She's leaving the bar</i>

19:54.126 --> 19:56.694
and walking into what's
going to become her death.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.906
Can you try camera one?

20:09.007 --> 20:12.577
[narrator]<i> Detective DuGal wants
to see if Jennifer left the bar alone.</i>

20:15.113 --> 20:16.847
[DuGal]<i> Everybody's a
person of interest at this point.</i>

20:16.949 --> 20:19.584
We just don't know
who the suspect is

20:19.685 --> 20:20.985
and we need to figure that out.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.356
Stop, rewind on that.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.230
Who is that talking to her?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.829
Let's move on to the exit door.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.970
No one's following her.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.439
Were they already out there?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.510
[DuGal]<i> I'm looking over</i>
<i>every inch to make sure that</i>

21:19.611 --> 21:22.246
<i>there's nobody following her,
there's no shadows,</i>

21:22.347 --> 21:23.681
<i>but then I lose sight of her.</i>

21:24.383 --> 21:25.850
That's it. She's gone.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.551
<i>We're looking for a suspect,</i>

21:27.653 --> 21:30.354
and this is only moments
before she's murdered.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.733
I need to ask you some
questions about Lee Crowell.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.436
Sure.

21:45.537 --> 21:50.207
Did Lee and Jennifer
get along after their breakup?

21:50.309 --> 21:53.477
Eventually,
yes, they got along fine.

21:53.578 --> 21:57.248
[Hubbert]<i> While speaking with
Jennifer's family regarding Lee,</i>

21:57.349 --> 21:59.550
they're adamant
that Lee and Jennifer

21:59.651 --> 22:01.719
had a good relationship
currently.

22:03.789 --> 22:06.424
My son, Justin, was with Lee

22:06.525 --> 22:09.360
and they were up at 4:00 a.m.
playing video games,

22:09.461 --> 22:13.097
and there's no way
that Lee was involved

22:13.198 --> 22:14.732
with what happened to Jennifer.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.471
[Hubbert]<i> Based on</i>
<i>these family interviews,</i>

22:20.572 --> 22:22.139
<i>we were able to eliminate Lee</i>

22:22.240 --> 22:24.442
as a potential suspect
in this case.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.511
Do you recognize anybody
in this photo?

22:29.214 --> 22:33.351
[Hubbert]<i> Jennifer's family was
shown the surveillance photo</i>

22:33.452 --> 22:36.687
<i>of the person
in the striped sweatshirt,</i>

22:36.788 --> 22:39.256
<i>but they were unable
to identify this individual.</i>

22:41.660 --> 22:42.660
[cell phone ringing]

22:46.198 --> 22:46.964
Hubbert.

22:49.368 --> 22:53.137
[narrator]<i> All 12 cameras from</i>
<i>the GTM store are processed.</i>

22:59.478 --> 23:00.778
It's all loaded, ready to go.

23:02.581 --> 23:05.983
[narrator]<i> They start with the
GTM camera facing Dirk's Bar.</i>

23:21.366 --> 23:22.400
Is that her?

23:24.069 --> 23:26.837
[Hubbert]
<i>At approximately 1:43 a.m.,</i>

23:26.938 --> 23:29.740
<i>a figure is seen
walking from Dirk's</i>

23:29.841 --> 23:32.243
<i>towards the parking lot
of the GTM.</i>

23:37.416 --> 23:39.950
<i>We can see that this person
is smoking a cigarette</i>

23:40.051 --> 23:42.753
<i>and has
a light-colored sweatshirt on.</i>

23:45.957 --> 23:47.792
[DuGal] I can't tell.

23:47.893 --> 23:49.960
[Hubbert]<i> You wouldn't know
that was Jennifer at that point.</i>

23:50.962 --> 23:51.996
Let's try a different camera.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.406
[Hubbert]<i> Now you can</i>
<i>absolutely tell it's her.</i>

24:12.651 --> 24:15.052
<i>She was viewing something
that was on the tablet.</i>

24:15.153 --> 24:17.021
<i>I don't know what
that something was,</i>

24:17.088 --> 24:20.357
<i>but it was while she was
all alone in that parking lot.</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:24.094
[DuGal]<i> This is feet away</i>
<i>from where Jennifer was found.</i>

24:24.196 --> 24:26.797
<i>We realized that these were
the last moments</i>

24:26.898 --> 24:28.599
<i>that Jennifer will be alive.</i>

24:33.405 --> 24:34.939
[Hubbert]<i> We lose her</i>
<i>for just a moment.</i>

24:36.675 --> 24:39.710
[narrator] <i>They switch to a
camera from Olive Tree Apartments.</i>

24:46.651 --> 24:49.286
[DuGal]<i> We picked her back up</i>
<i>on this video.</i>

24:53.658 --> 24:57.261
<i>We see a male subject
confronts Jennifer.</i>

24:59.931 --> 25:01.332
<i>There's a struggle,</i>

25:01.433 --> 25:03.667
<i>both images actually leave
the frame.</i>

25:08.707 --> 25:10.007
<i>And then come back.</i>

25:16.147 --> 25:18.115
<i>The smaller image,
which is Jennifer,</i>

25:18.884 --> 25:20.117
<i>drops to the ground.</i>

25:21.253 --> 25:22.319
[exhales]

25:22.420 --> 25:24.822
[Hubbert]<i> We know that</i>
<i>we've just seen the murder</i>

25:24.923 --> 25:27.258
of Jennifer occur
before our eyes.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.362
[DuGal]<i> Probably</i>
<i>the saddest moment,</i>

25:31.463 --> 25:33.430
<i>and yet, the best moment
for the investigation</i>

25:33.532 --> 25:36.534
was the fact that
we now had Jennifer's murder

25:36.635 --> 25:38.369
captured on surveillance video.

25:55.620 --> 25:59.290
[Hubbert]<i> We know that if
we delay and go home to sleep</i>

25:59.391 --> 26:00.958
<i>that that may be the time</i>

26:01.059 --> 26:03.961
that the killer needs
to get away.

26:13.705 --> 26:14.805
[DuGal] Let's play that again.

26:15.907 --> 26:20.578
<i>We looked for anything
that was identifiable.</i>

26:20.679 --> 26:23.881
[Hubbert]<i> As this person is
seen walking away from Jennifer,</i>

26:23.982 --> 26:26.784
<i>we see that there's
a glimmer or a light.</i>

26:29.054 --> 26:33.223
The unfortunate part is the
video is very dark and very grainy.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.999
[Hubbert]<i> At 1:48 a.m.,</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:45.035
<i>a dark colored truck
is seen driving east</i>

26:45.136 --> 26:46.503
<i>on Pacific Avenue.</i>

26:46.605 --> 26:47.738
<i>The truck stops...</i>

27:07.292 --> 27:10.561
<i>A male goes towards the area
where Jennifer was lying.</i>

27:13.465 --> 27:17.501
<i>It appears the person throws
something down onto the ground</i>

27:17.602 --> 27:18.869
<i>that is illuminated.</i>

27:23.541 --> 27:27.177
<i>We believe the male tossed
the tablet back onto the ground.</i>

27:31.282 --> 27:33.584
<i>After that,
the male returns to the truck</i>

27:34.119 --> 27:35.219
<i>and drives off.</i>

27:37.422 --> 27:39.356
It's no good,
I can't make out any features.

27:39.457 --> 27:42.459
- [cell phone ringing]
- Hubbert.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.495
[narrator] <i>Custodio Toyo Ramirez</i>

<i>during the time of the incident.</i>

His girlfriend, Krystal,

a person named Casey.</i>

28:43.121 --> 28:46.790
[narrator]<i> The same name mentioned
by the bartender at Dirk's Bar.</i>

29:02.607 --> 29:06.543
Both Krystal and Toyo are
unable to provide any further details

29:06.644 --> 29:09.913
about Casey other than
they believe that he lives

29:10.014 --> 29:11.281
in the Lemon Grove area.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.687
<i>While examining
Jennifer's phone,</i>

29:16.788 --> 29:18.722
<i>we locate several messages</i>

29:18.823 --> 29:21.058
<i>that were between her and Casey.</i>

29:21.159 --> 29:24.461
<i>The last text sent
from Jennifer to Casey</i>

29:24.562 --> 29:27.631
<i>was at approximately 10:25 p.m.</i>

29:27.732 --> 29:29.767
<i>the evening Jennifer
was murdered,</i>

29:29.868 --> 29:34.271
<i>asking Casey to meet her
at Dirk's for a few drinks.</i>

29:34.372 --> 29:37.274
<i>And it is our belief
that Casey is the person</i>

29:37.375 --> 29:39.610
that was with Jennifer
while at the bar.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.116
[narrator]<i> A regular</i>
<i>at Dirk's Bar,</i>

29:46.217 --> 29:48.585
<i>who often socialized
with Jennifer,</i>

29:48.686 --> 29:50.420
<i>comes forward with information.</i>

29:50.522 --> 29:52.389
Hi, Detective. I'm Clyde.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.691
He tells me he's
a friend of Jennifer's.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.693
He did see her
in the bar that night

29:56.795 --> 29:58.061
with an unknown male.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.964
I think I saw something or
something that could be useful...

30:01.065 --> 30:03.100
I had a gut feeling
that this is the man

30:03.201 --> 30:04.168
that they need to find.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.372
<i>The man started talking
to Jennifer,</i>

30:09.007 --> 30:10.941
<i>it seemed very cordial.</i>

30:11.042 --> 30:14.778
[DuGal]<i> Part of his witness
statement included a interesting fact.</i>

30:14.879 --> 30:19.550
<i>There's a moment when Jennifer
and this unknown male stand up.</i>

30:19.651 --> 30:24.454
[Clyde]<i> Their conversation
was clearly a little more personal,</i>

30:24.556 --> 30:25.989
<i>a little more serious.</i>

30:26.090 --> 30:28.225
<i>They decided to move it
to the back of the bar,</i>

30:28.326 --> 30:30.060
<i>where there's
less patrons there.</i>

30:38.203 --> 30:41.371
No one was in the back to
hear what they had spoke of,

30:43.341 --> 30:46.777
<i>but the entire mood
in the bar had changed.</i>

30:48.746 --> 30:51.081
[narrator] <i>A few minutes
later, they're back.</i>

30:55.887 --> 30:57.654
[DuGal]<i> The whole atmosphere</i>
<i>was elevated.</i>

30:57.755 --> 31:00.557
His emotion and Jennifer's
emotions don't match.

31:00.658 --> 31:01.491
He's angry.

31:04.362 --> 31:07.497
[Clyde]<i> Seeing this man</i>
<i>walk out of the bar</i>

31:07.599 --> 31:10.300
<i>very upset, very emotional,</i>

31:10.401 --> 31:13.103
<i>you knew right away
that there was</i>

31:13.204 --> 31:16.306
<i>some sort of negative
discussion with Jennifer.</i>

31:19.577 --> 31:23.580
He's not getting
the affection he's desiring.

31:23.681 --> 31:25.849
<i>That together turns into
a perfect storm.</i>

31:33.024 --> 31:36.226
[narrator] <i>The detectives track
Casey on the parking lot cameras.</i>

31:48.940 --> 31:51.808
[Hubbert]<i> We observed</i>
<i>at approximately 1:30 a.m.,</i>

31:51.910 --> 31:55.078
<i>Casey walking from Dirk's
smoking a cigarette.</i>

31:57.515 --> 32:00.284
<i>He enters a dark-colored
pickup truck</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:02.686
<i>and he leaves.</i>

32:05.089 --> 32:08.325
[narrator]<i> Another angle gives
Hubbert a better view of the truck.</i>

32:09.127 --> 32:10.861
Freeze here, let's have a look.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.131
[video rewinds]

32:16.935 --> 32:18.402
I think I can work with that.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.705
<i>The truck is dark in color,</i>

32:21.806 --> 32:23.440
<i>has silver wheels,</i>

32:23.541 --> 32:27.110
<i>and we're able to get a
basic design of the front grille.</i>

32:28.313 --> 32:30.647
<i>We believe that the make
and model of the truck</i>

32:30.748 --> 32:31.949
<i>was a Nissan Titan.</i>

32:32.383 --> 32:33.216
It's a match.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.921
[narrator]<i> Around 15 minutes</i>
<i>before Jennifer is shot,</i>

32:38.022 --> 32:40.090
<i>Casey's truck drives off.</i>

32:40.191 --> 32:43.493
<i>But if he is the killer,
it should reappear.</i>

32:49.100 --> 32:52.402
After the vehicle leaves
the GTM parking lot,

32:52.503 --> 32:54.771
it has gone for
six-and-a-half minutes.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.487
At last.

33:14.926 --> 33:18.028
[Hubbert]<i> It is seen returning</i>
<i>towards the GTM.</i>

33:18.129 --> 33:20.530
<i>The vehicle then proceeds
on to Pacific Avenue...</i>

33:21.432 --> 33:22.332
Try a different camera.

33:29.774 --> 33:31.074
<i>...driving past the location</i>

33:31.175 --> 33:32.609
<i>where Jennifer was later found,</i>

33:34.946 --> 33:37.981
<i>and then turns into
a apartment complex.</i>

33:40.752 --> 33:43.954
<i>Based on this truck parking
facing towards the area</i>

33:44.055 --> 33:45.689
<i>where Jennifer
would later be found,</i>

33:45.790 --> 33:49.459
<i>I believe that Casey
had returned to the area</i>

33:49.560 --> 33:50.894
<i>and was waiting for Jennifer.</i>

33:53.297 --> 33:56.099
[narrator]<i> But they still</i>
<i>don't know Casey's last name.</i>

33:57.869 --> 34:00.670
We had a general description,
we had no idea who he is.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.606
There's a million Caseys
in Lemon Grove.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.077
<i>We are concerned that
the suspect is out there</i>

34:07.178 --> 34:10.313
<i>and he's got a high potential
to commit other murders.</i>

34:10.415 --> 34:13.683
We need to find him
as quickly as possible.

34:13.785 --> 34:16.920
We had numerous detectives
working around the clock

34:17.021 --> 34:19.089
<i>to identify him and locate him.</i>

34:22.527 --> 34:25.062
<i>There was a man
who came forward,</i>

34:25.163 --> 34:26.463
<i>who was a witness.</i>

34:26.564 --> 34:29.433
<i>He had been in the bar
earlier that day</i>

34:29.534 --> 34:32.135
<i>and saw his friend Jennifer,</i>

34:32.236 --> 34:34.671
<i>and Jennifer had relayed to him</i>

34:34.772 --> 34:37.741
that she was waiting
on a man named Casey

34:37.842 --> 34:41.144
who was coming to socialize
and drink with her.

34:46.184 --> 34:46.817
[officer speaking]

34:46.918 --> 34:47.617
[man speaking]

35:00.798 --> 35:04.301
She also told this witness
that Casey was somebody

35:04.402 --> 35:08.071
who was pursuing her
in an intimate fashion.

35:15.546 --> 35:18.248
He wanted to have a relationship
closer than a friendship,

35:18.349 --> 35:19.516
and she was aware of that.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.151
<i>He also knew from Jennifer</i>

35:21.252 --> 35:23.954
<i>that this Casey lived
not only on his street</i>

35:24.055 --> 35:25.989
<i>but, like, very close to him,</i>

35:26.090 --> 35:28.859
and that this Casey
drove a black pickup truck.

35:29.627 --> 35:30.427
[officer speaking]

35:32.897 --> 35:33.697
[man speaking]

35:48.012 --> 35:49.112
[cell phone rings]

35:50.114 --> 35:53.083
Hubbert. Noble Street's...

35:53.184 --> 35:56.219
<i>The address is entered into
law enforcement databases,</i>

35:56.320 --> 35:59.489
<i>and we find that
a 2007 Nissan Titan</i>

35:59.590 --> 36:01.491
<i>is registered to that address</i>

36:01.559 --> 36:04.628
<i>and belongs to a person
named Casey Tschida.</i>

36:04.729 --> 36:06.229
[DuGal]<i> He is</i>
<i>suspect of a murder.</i>

36:06.330 --> 36:07.764
<i>He's a danger to the public.</i>

36:07.865 --> 36:10.367
We have to find Casey Tschida
as fast as possible.

36:18.109 --> 36:21.344
[DuGal]<i> Once we had identified</i>
<i>Casey Tschida as a suspect...</i>

36:21.445 --> 36:22.913
Got it.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.348
[DuGal]<i> ...we obtained a
search warrant for his residence.</i>

36:26.651 --> 36:29.186
The vehicle is no longer there,

36:29.287 --> 36:31.755
<i>and upon entry, we find that</i>

36:31.856 --> 36:34.658
<i>Casey is not at the residence,
either.</i>

36:34.759 --> 36:36.593
[DuGal]<i> All indications</i>
<i>in the house was that</i>

36:36.694 --> 36:38.461
<i>he packed up and he left.</i>

36:38.963 --> 36:39.930
He was on the run.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.603
[Hubbert]<i> We locate</i>
<i>a receipt from a gun store</i>

36:46.704 --> 36:49.206
<i>for the purchase
of several weapons,</i>

36:49.307 --> 36:52.209
<i>one of them being
a 9-millimeter handgun.</i>

36:54.545 --> 36:57.080
We put out a BOL
or a "be-on-the-lookout"

36:57.181 --> 36:58.982
<i>to other law enforcement
agencies.</i>

37:00.484 --> 37:03.086
[narrator]<i> For two days,</i>
<i>detectives chase down</i>

37:03.187 --> 37:05.956
<i>reported sightings
of Tschida and his vehicle.</i>

37:09.794 --> 37:10.961
[cell phone rings]

37:11.062 --> 37:13.863
[Hubbert]<i> On January 5th,</i>
<i>we received a phone call...</i>

37:13.965 --> 37:15.365
Hubbert.

37:15.466 --> 37:17.534
<i>...from the Clackamas County
Sheriff's Department in Oregon.</i>

37:17.635 --> 37:18.602
Okay.

37:18.703 --> 37:20.971
<i>The detectives tell us
that Casey Tschida</i>

37:21.072 --> 37:23.073
<i>arrived at his mother's house</i>

37:23.174 --> 37:25.342
and tells his mother
that "I killed somebody."

37:26.611 --> 37:29.079
<i>Casey's mother goes to
the sheriff's office</i>

37:29.180 --> 37:32.682
and reports the claims
that Casey made to detectives.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.020
[narrator]<i> Two days</i>
<i>after Jennifer's murder,</i>

37:38.723 --> 37:40.824
<i>Casey Tschida is arrested.</i>

37:42.293 --> 37:44.995
Myself and another detective
flew to Oregon

37:45.096 --> 37:48.465
<i>to interview Casey
and collect Casey's vehicle.</i>

37:51.168 --> 37:52.002
Mr. Tschida...

38:29.373 --> 38:31.141
And so he did not make
a statement.

38:32.243 --> 38:34.177
<i>But as he sat in front of me,</i>

38:34.278 --> 38:37.314
Casey's physical image
through my eyes

38:37.415 --> 38:40.283
was the same guy that
was sitting next to Jennifer.

38:41.185 --> 38:42.819
His truck was the same truck

38:42.920 --> 38:44.688
<i>I saw in the video surveillance.</i>

38:45.790 --> 38:47.223
I was confident we had our man.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.363
[narrator]<i> And a search of the
truck confirms DuGal's theory.</i>

38:53.464 --> 38:54.431
[camera shutter clicks]

38:54.532 --> 38:59.169
We locate a empty
9-millimeter handgun gun case.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.438
<i>Inside is a test-fire cartridge</i>

39:01.539 --> 39:04.341
<i>that matched the bullet
that killed Jennifer.</i>

39:05.209 --> 39:07.243
<i>That test-fire bullet cartridge</i>

39:07.345 --> 39:10.013
<i>is compared with
the cartridge that was located</i>

39:10.114 --> 39:12.115
<i>next to Jennifer in the street.</i>

39:12.216 --> 39:14.417
<i>The sheriff's crime lab
confirmed</i>

39:14.518 --> 39:17.987
<i>that those two cartridges
were fired by the same firearm.</i>

39:18.956 --> 39:21.658
<i>Also in the vehicle,
we discover blood</i>

39:21.759 --> 39:23.760
<i>on the driver's side arm rest.</i>

39:23.861 --> 39:27.364
<i>That blood is compared with
a DNA sample of Jennifer,</i>

39:27.465 --> 39:28.865
and it's confirmed
to be a match.

39:30.634 --> 39:34.771
[narrator]<i> At trial, Tschida
admits to shooting Jennifer,</i>

39:34.872 --> 39:37.407
<i>but insists he snapped
in the heat of the moment.</i>

39:39.477 --> 39:42.278
<i>The prosecution lays out
a very different story.</i>

39:43.981 --> 39:45.348
[DuGal]<i> The night of the murder,</i>

39:45.449 --> 39:47.717
<i>Jennifer goes
to Dirk's Niteclub,</i>

39:47.818 --> 39:50.387
<i>and she sends a text message
to Casey Tschida</i>

39:50.488 --> 39:53.156
<i>and she invites him
to have cocktails with her.</i>

39:53.257 --> 39:56.559
<i>He joins her, and they have
a good time for hours.</i>

39:56.660 --> 39:59.229
<i>They're drinking,
they're socializing.</i>

39:59.330 --> 40:02.031
<i>The video captures those moments</i>

40:02.133 --> 40:04.200
<i>and all that time perfectly.</i>

40:04.301 --> 40:06.002
And there's
nothing extraordinary

40:06.103 --> 40:08.371
until closer to
the end of the evening,

40:08.472 --> 40:10.707
<i>when we have some confrontation.</i>

40:10.808 --> 40:12.575
<i>The hallelujah moment is,</i>

40:13.344 --> 40:14.244
we have the video.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.214
[narrator]<i> Jennifer rejects</i>
<i>Casey's advances.</i>

40:20.351 --> 40:23.386
[DuGal]<i> Casey on video</i>
<i>kind of dismisses Jennifer,</i>

40:23.487 --> 40:26.256
<i>where they're talking, and then
he gets up and he dismisses her.</i>

40:27.892 --> 40:28.758
<i>He's angry.</i>

40:30.628 --> 40:32.028
<i>Jennifer, on the other hand,</i>

40:32.129 --> 40:34.130
<i>is not exhibiting anger</i>

<i>through any of
the surveillance cameras.</i>

40:40.171 --> 40:43.273
[Hubbert]<i> Casey returned home</i>
<i>to retrieve his firearm,</i>

40:44.108 --> 40:45.842
<i>and then returned to the scene</i>

40:46.844 --> 40:49.345
<i>to wait for Jennifer
as she walked home.</i>

40:50.881 --> 40:52.382
[DuGal]<i> She's captured on video</i>

40:52.483 --> 40:53.716
<i>walking out of the bar,</i>

40:53.818 --> 40:56.586
<i>walking through
the GTM parking lot,</i>

40:56.687 --> 40:58.288
<i>and walking towards
the apartment</i>

40:58.389 --> 40:59.289
<i>where she was staying.</i>

41:00.324 --> 41:02.292
<i>He stops the vehicle
by her location.</i>

41:02.393 --> 41:04.160
<i>He gets out of the vehicle
with the gun.</i>

41:06.597 --> 41:08.264
<i>He approaches Jennifer,</i>

41:10.067 --> 41:11.501
<i>a confrontation ensues.</i>

41:13.270 --> 41:15.371
<i>Casey shot Jennifer
at that point.</i>

41:15.473 --> 41:17.173
[gunshot]

41:17.274 --> 41:19.843
<i>She goes down to the ground
and she never moves again.</i>

41:21.345 --> 41:23.746
<i>He had the gun
when he got out of the car,</i>

41:23.848 --> 41:27.417
<i>premeditated, shoots her,
goes back into the car,</i>

41:27.518 --> 41:30.119
turns on his lights like nothing
happened and drives away.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.757
[narrator]
<i>But two minutes later,</i>

41:35.926 --> 41:38.061
<i>Tschida returns.</i>

41:38.162 --> 41:40.830
[Hubbert]<i> There's several
theories on why he would do this.</i>

41:40.931 --> 41:43.867
<i>One is that he was trying
to wipe the evidence of him</i>

41:43.968 --> 41:45.001
<i>touching the tablet.</i>

41:48.439 --> 41:51.774
[narrator]<i> The jury find Tschida
guilty of first degree murder.</i>

41:52.943 --> 41:54.844
<i>He's sentenced to life in prison</i>

41:54.945 --> 41:56.980
<i>without the possibility
of parole.</i>

42:05.155 --> 42:06.823
[Gale]<i> He took her away from us.</i>

42:07.691 --> 42:09.058
It's just not fair.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.195
[Joseph]<i> I mean,</i>
<i>she barely knew him,</i>

42:12.329 --> 42:14.497
and that's just crazy that

42:14.598 --> 42:17.767
<i>he could just go and do
this kind of thing to her.</i>

42:17.868 --> 42:20.536
[Gale]<i> She kept telling me,</i>
<i>"I ain't never having kids,"</i>

42:20.604 --> 42:24.073
but on the sly, she would
tell me every now and then,

42:24.174 --> 42:26.676
"I wonder what it would
feel like to be a mom."

42:27.545 --> 42:30.146
I think about her
every day, still.

42:30.247 --> 42:32.582
