00:08.125 --> 00:10.083
(man on TV)
'Violence continued
overnight in Iraq'

00:10.166 --> 00:11.583
'with some of the
fiercest fighting to
date..'

00:35.917 --> 00:37.041
(male #1)
'Come on. Push through.'

00:37.125 --> 00:38.583
Push through.
Don't give up on me now.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.709
Come on. You got it.
You got it. Don't give up on
me.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.250
Come on. Come on.
Alright.

00:45.709 --> 00:48.000
- What's bugging you, Bobby?
- Nothing.

00:50.625 --> 00:52.583
Hey.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.959
- You remembered?
- You're 18 today.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.291
You haven't talked about
anything else for three

00:59.375 --> 01:02.125
whole months,
how could I
forget?

01:02.208 --> 01:04.083
My family did.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.083
I'm your family now.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.750
You know that.

01:07.834 --> 01:08.834
Go ahead.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.959
It belonged to
my buddy, Johnny Hughes.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.834
'It's a compass. Carried it
with
him on every single jump.'

01:16.917 --> 01:20.083
He gave that to me
to help me find my
way.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.750
Now it's yours.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.542
Doesn't matter
where you been.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.333
Only matters
where you go.

01:26.417 --> 01:27.625
'Listen.'

01:29.083 --> 01:30.667
I'm not talking to you
right now as your
recruiter.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.208
Okay, I'm talking
to you as a
brother

01:32.291 --> 01:33.417
'cause that's
how I see you,
right?

01:33.500 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, man.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.125
I am proud of you, no
matter
what you decide to do.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.166
I wanna sign my contract.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.500
- Today.
- Yeah?

01:45.583 --> 01:47.166
Yeah!

01:47.250 --> 01:50.875
Oh, y-you're not going to
regret this, Bobby. You're
not.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.667
The Army put me on
the right track,
man.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.250
It's gonna do
the same for
you.

01:55.333 --> 01:56.917
Thank you.

02:08.542 --> 02:11.000
That's uh, beautiful.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.417
(Jeffries)
'Homicide.'

02:34.500 --> 02:36.542
Yes.
Lil, dad's on the line.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.750
Mind taking a message?

02:37.834 --> 02:39.500
I'm tied up.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.083
At ease.

02:48.041 --> 02:49.500
Bumper, huh?

02:49.583 --> 02:51.417
That's what they call me.
Name's Bobby, though.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.542
Well, Bobby, I found
Mike Donley's murder
file.

02:55.625 --> 02:56.917
Says here
that he broke
into

02:57.000 --> 02:59.250
the Prestige Pawnshop
over on 6th Street.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.583
And the body was found
in
an alley a few hours
later.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.083
November 5, 2005.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.834
Cops found some of the
stolen jewelry near his
body.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.333
Figured he was
jacked for the
rest.

03:07.417 --> 03:08.750
You got some new information?

03:08.834 --> 03:10.500
Found the article
from the paper online.

03:10.583 --> 03:13.458
It says the pawnshop alarm
got tripped at 11:00 P.M.

03:13.542 --> 03:14.417
So?

03:14.500 --> 03:15.458
Staff Sergeant Donley

03:15.542 --> 03:16.542
was with me at 11:00.

03:16.625 --> 03:20.000
Putting me on
a bus to Fort Bragg.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.750
Ticket...from the
night of the
murder.

03:22.834 --> 03:23.875
He didn't rob that store, ma'am.

03:23.959 --> 03:25.417
It's been four years, Bobby.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.917
What took you so
long to come
forward?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.667
I'm Special Forces.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.375
Green Berets.

03:30.458 --> 03:33.834
Went from training at Fort
Bragg
to two tours in Afghanistan.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.083
Just got home.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.959
Well, bus ticket
doesn't
prove he was with
you.

03:37.041 --> 03:41.125
Ma'am, army thinks one of its
top soldiers is a criminal.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.792
Gotta make it right.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.709
'Staff Sergeant
Donley changed my life.'

03:46.875 --> 03:49.375
The least I can do is honor his.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.083
(Lilly)
'Staff Sergeant Michael
Donley.'

04:29.166 --> 04:30.500
Around 28 years old.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.709
He served with the
82nd Airborne in
Afghanistan.

04:32.792 --> 04:36.166
Awarded a Bronze Star with a
"V"
for valor and a Purple Heart.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.875
Moved back to Philly in 2004

04:37.959 --> 04:39.667
when he got assigned
as an Army recruiter.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.542
Long way from bleeding to death
in the alley at 6th and Oxford.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.709
Well, he'd just
gotten orders to go to Iraq.

04:44.792 --> 04:47.500
Due to deploy two days
after he was killed.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.792
(Kat)
'Mike had a few run-ins'

04:48.875 --> 04:51.083
with the cops
before he enlisted.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.959
B and E, petty theft.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.375
Old habits die hard.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.041
Well, witness saw
someone running from the
site

04:56.125 --> 04:58.667
of the pawnshop
burglary,
wearing an army ski cap

04:58.750 --> 05:01.709
found at the murder scene
half a mile from the
pawnshop

05:01.792 --> 05:05.375
along with four
stolen necklaces.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.083
The rest of the
jewelries was never recovered.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.792
Circumstantial.
The investigation never tied
him

05:09.875 --> 05:11.667
to the burglary conclusively.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.208
So if Mike was with
Bobby at the bus station

05:14.291 --> 05:17.875
when the alarm went off, how'd
he end up in that alley after?

05:17.959 --> 05:20.333
Catching detective
was Walter Gardner.

05:20.417 --> 05:22.750
Look at his interview notes.
Almost nothing here.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.291
Well, Walter was a Marine.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.542
And he wouldn't
have pushed too hard

05:25.625 --> 05:27.208
if it was gonna
disgrace a war
hero.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.458
No. Questioned Mike's
recruits, other recruiters.

05:29.542 --> 05:32.333
Got their phone numbers,
some alibis, not much else.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.583
Then we re-interview 'em.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.041
Where are we on
the murder weapon?

05:36.125 --> 05:37.583
Pulled a .380 slug from the body

05:37.667 --> 05:38.667
casing from the scene.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.083
(Miller)
'No matches in '05.'

05:40.166 --> 05:41.458
I'll run it again

05:41.542 --> 05:42.917
see if it's surfaced since then.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.250
Test the hat
and jewelry for
DNA.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.458
Well, Mike's supervisor

05:46.542 --> 05:48.583
First Sergeant Gomez
is coming in.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.542
Well, talk to the widow, too.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.291
Dad. I was uh, I was
gonna call you back.

05:59.375 --> 06:00.875
I tried you three times.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.208
Well, I'm busy.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.917
Not too busy to
be seeing Finn.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.458
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted

06:05.542 --> 06:06.792
for me to meet your family.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.875
At our house,
not behind my
back.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.125
I can't get
into this right now.

06:10.208 --> 06:12.291
He's gone.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.792
I found your card in his things.

06:13.875 --> 06:17.834
We had an argument.
He stormed off.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.291
Well, teenagers do that.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.417
Not Finn.
Not until
recently.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.667
Oh, you're saying it's my fault.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.875
Of course not.

06:23.959 --> 06:25.834
(male #2)
'...files you asked for.'

06:28.083 --> 06:29.375
He took some cash

06:29.458 --> 06:31.291
a thousand
dollars,
the car too.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.166
He's been gone
since yesterday
morning.

06:33.250 --> 06:38.792
I was hoping there was
something you could do as a
cop.

06:38.875 --> 06:39.917
I'll get into it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.291
Okay.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.417
(male #3)
'Mike was hardcore.'

06:44.500 --> 06:47.750
Up in the Afghan mountains,
there was an enemy ambush.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.291
He held them off for two days.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.709
Took two rounds.

06:50.792 --> 06:51.750
They medevac'd him out

06:51.834 --> 06:52.792
and he's back in rotation

06:52.875 --> 06:54.125
less than two weeks later.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.500
Well it doesn't
answer my question

06:55.583 --> 06:57.417
about his state
of mind, Sergeant Gomez.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.208
It's First Sergeant Gomez.

06:59.291 --> 07:00.667
'He struggled a
little bit at first.'

07:00.750 --> 07:02.834
'It was hard going
from combat to recruiting'

07:02.917 --> 07:05.583
till he realized
how vital the mission
was.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.959
How do you mean?

07:07.041 --> 07:08.458
As a volunteer army,
it falls on the
recruiter

07:08.542 --> 07:11.291
to send support
or troops
overseas.

07:11.375 --> 07:12.750
It wasn't easy in 2005.

07:12.834 --> 07:14.000
Not a popular war.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.000
How'd Mike do at it?

07:15.083 --> 07:16.667
He was our top recruiter.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.875
DEP's really took to him.

07:18.959 --> 07:20.834
- DEP's?
- Delayed Entry Program.

07:20.917 --> 07:22.667
That's what we
call
prospective
recruits.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.000
Well, 6th and
Oxford's a tough
block.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.709
A lot of drugs, gangs.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.333
What do you think
he was doing there?

07:28.417 --> 07:30.917
Well, it's like
I told the cops back
then

07:31.000 --> 07:32.542
most of his DEPs
lived in that
area.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.834
Well, dangerous neighborhood
to be making house calls.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.667
Mike grew up there.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.041
He had a lot in
common with those
kids.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.542
That's why he succeeded.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.000
Shared experience.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.500
We're going to need access
to Mike's recruiting files

07:44.583 --> 07:45.750
and phone records.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.625
You'll have to speak
to my officer in
charge.

07:47.709 --> 07:50.208
Well, we'll do that,
First Sergeant Gomez.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.542
Uh, near the end..

07:53.625 --> 07:54.792
...Mike was distant.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.333
I'm not
gonna
lie to you.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.125
I was worried for him.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.834
We'd just gotten
back from the Poconos.

08:00.917 --> 08:02.375
Belated honeymoon.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.959
It was supposed
to be relaxing, but he was

08:05.041 --> 08:07.583
tense, distant.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.000
You two have any money problems?

08:09.083 --> 08:11.125
You don't join
the service to get rich.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.208
How did Mike feel about
getting his orders for Iraq?

08:13.291 --> 08:14.208
I don't know.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.375
I found out after he died.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.458
He didn't tell you?

08:17.542 --> 08:18.709
Like I said, he was distant.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.709
Your husband saw
combat in Afghanistan.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.709
A lot of soldiers..

08:23.792 --> 08:25.083
...change..

08:25.166 --> 08:26.125
...when they come back from war.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.083
Look, those last few weeks.

08:28.166 --> 08:30.250
Mike was troubled.
I was concerned for him.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.917
I just assumed it was
because of these kids.

08:34.000 --> 08:34.834
His recruits?

08:34.917 --> 08:36.000
They brought a lot of problems

08:36.083 --> 08:37.458
with them.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.792
Bottom line, it wasn't
Iraq I was afraid of.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.750
Johnny Hughes was small.
Lousy at sports.

08:43.834 --> 08:45.875
Came from a town
with no
opportunities.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.417
- Ain't gonna lie.
- "Ain't?"

08:48.500 --> 08:49.709
It's a turn of phrase.

08:49.792 --> 08:51.417
It's bad grammar.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.917
I'm trying to
connect with the
kids.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.083
Well, you can still
connect with proper English.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.333
Okay.

08:58.417 --> 09:02.291
Um, I'm not gonna lie
Johnny had a hard life.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.959
Well, he didn't let
that keep him down.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.625
He enlisted on his 18th
birthday, he went airborne

09:06.709 --> 09:08.333
and he made
something of himself.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.792
It's after midnight, Mike.

09:12.875 --> 09:13.875
What do you want me to tell her?

09:13.959 --> 09:15.458
To go someplace else.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.125
Fine.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.083
Sergeant Mike,
he's gonna kill her.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.458
'What happened?'

09:27.542 --> 09:28.792
They were throwing
things at each other.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.458
He said he was gonna go
get a gun.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.250
- He means it.
- We need to call the police.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.458
What? No! Don't kick me out!

09:35.542 --> 09:37.583
Let me handle this, alright?

09:38.375 --> 09:40.542
I'm all she's got.

09:40.625 --> 09:41.959
You can't go over there again.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.583
The man is going to kill you.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.834
I'll be fine.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.166
Come on, Victoria.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.333
Victoria Montero.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.500
Our weekly dose of drama.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.208
Her stepdad was
a violent alcoholic.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.667
Mike always intervene?

10:01.750 --> 10:03.875
He was like the United Nations.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.166
I was sure one day
he'd go over to Victoria's

10:06.250 --> 10:08.458
and he'd never come back.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.667
Sergeant Donley saved my life.
No question about it.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.375
He's the reason
I survived my teens.

10:16.458 --> 10:18.667
Is that why you came back
to the same recruiting
station?

10:18.750 --> 10:20.250
As soon as I served
my time in Iraq

10:20.333 --> 10:23.083
I requested recruiter
duty doing for the kids

10:23.166 --> 10:24.166
what Mike did for me.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.375
I understand Mike intervened

10:25.458 --> 10:27.917
in some family
trouble you were
having.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.458
If by family trouble you mean my

10:29.542 --> 10:32.792
mom and stepdad trying
to kill each other? Yeah.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.375
I heard your
stepfather was a violent man.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.625
How did he take
to Mike helping you out?

10:37.709 --> 10:39.834
He loved having
Sergeant Donley around.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.125
Big hero in
the house, macho crap.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.875
Any idea where he was
the night of the
murder?

10:44.959 --> 10:47.667
No. I was working.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.041
And your mom, how did she feel

10:49.125 --> 10:51.208
'bout Mike trying
to send you off to war?

10:51.291 --> 10:52.500
She didn't care as long as she

10:52.583 --> 10:54.959
got half
of my $20,000 signing bonus.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.041
- That's a lot of money.
- No kidding.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.875
I was working part-time
in a bodega, stocking shelves.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.709
So, Mike was offering you
an opportunity of a lifetime.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.792
Yeah. It was
a lifeline for a lot of
us.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.417
But not everyone
saw it the same way.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.250
Does the Army teach you how
to shoot and jump out of
planes?

11:12.333 --> 11:15.083
No doubt. But combat is such
a small part of what we do.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.250
Victoria wants to learn
about computers, right?

11:17.333 --> 11:18.917
She can qualify
for advanced training

11:19.000 --> 11:20.750
on the best
technology in the world.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.166
Plus, they'll be taking care
of my rent, food, and
medical.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.291
So, you guys, no community
college is going to do
that.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.959
Is there risk involved?
Of course there is.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.375
But if it weren't for the army

11:29.458 --> 11:30.917
I wouldn't be
standing here today.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.583
And I'm not alone in that.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.709
And it's not just about
what the Army has to offer
you.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.917
- 'A chance to die?'
- Dad?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.041
This the guy who's
been stalking you?

11:38.125 --> 11:39.250
Staff Sergeant Donley, sir.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.834
You need to stay
away from my son.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.333
- Stop pressuring him.
- Nobody's pressuring me.

11:42.417 --> 11:43.709
Army clothes and stickers.

11:43.792 --> 11:45.583
Thinks this is all
some damn adventure movie.

11:45.667 --> 11:46.834
- Now, let's go.
- No, no

11:46.917 --> 11:48.208
'I'm staying
with Sergeant Donley.'

11:48.291 --> 11:50.500
Damn it, Kevin. Let
me
make this clear.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.125
You are not enlisting!

11:52.208 --> 11:54.291
Do you have a problem
with the military, sir?

11:54.375 --> 11:56.083
I served four
years in the
navy.

11:56.166 --> 11:59.458
I have no problem with
Kevin signing up in college.

11:59.542 --> 12:02.250
ROTC. But he is too
smart
to be a part of your
quota.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.917
I agree, sir. Kevin
is an outstanding kid.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.959
Maybe if you would just take
the time to listen to him

12:08.041 --> 12:09.083
you'll understand
why he's interested.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.667
I don't care why.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.333
And this is the
last
time I'm gonna say
it.

12:13.417 --> 12:15.500
You stay away from him.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.083
Guy didn't get it.

12:20.166 --> 12:23.625
The more he fought, the more
he pushed his son to enlist.

12:23.709 --> 12:24.709
That's how kids are.

12:24.792 --> 12:27.041
That what happened?
Kevin enlisted?

12:27.125 --> 12:29.291
He went infantry.
He was on patrol

12:29.375 --> 12:31.166
maybe a week
into deployment in
Iraq.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.667
Killed by a sniper.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.333
Jerry Harkin, went off the
deep
end when his son got killed.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.500
Arrested for D&D, loitering.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.417
And a DUI on the
night of Mike's
murder.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.083
Guy lives in Chestnut Hill.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.166
So, what's he doing in
North Philly at 2:00
a.m.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.667
a mile from where
Mike was killed?

12:57.750 --> 12:59.041
Looks like our grieving father

12:59.125 --> 13:01.375
may have made
good on his threat.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.166
Keep my guns under lock and key.
They're all registered.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.125
I don't see how one could
have been used in a crime.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.125
- You mind if we take a look?
- Don't you need a warrant?

13:14.208 --> 13:15.542
Only if you got
something to hide.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.375
I got it.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.166
Remember a Sergeant Mike Donley?

13:21.250 --> 13:22.834
Died a few years ago, right?

13:22.917 --> 13:24.041
(Lilly)
'He was murdered.'

13:24.125 --> 13:25.542
Are you suggesting I shot him

13:25.625 --> 13:27.000
and then brought the gun home?

13:27.083 --> 13:28.792
Wouldn't be the first.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.250
"No," is the answer you're
looking for. I didn't kill
him.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.291
Well, you blamed him
for your son's death.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.959
I blamed everyone
for Kevin's death.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.709
(Lilly)
'I heard from Mike's
fellow recruiters'

13:36.792 --> 13:39.875
that you called the
recruiting
station a few times a day.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.291
Doesn't ring a bell.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.125
Threatening you were
gonna "make him pay."

13:43.208 --> 13:45.542
That ring a bell?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.417
You know, the school
gives out our
information.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.083
Phone numbers.
Everything.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.792
To the military.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.500
So they can
solicit our children.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.250
How can that possibly be right?

13:58.333 --> 13:59.792
Took out
your frustration on Mike.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.083
It's unnatural
to outlive your child.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.709
That's why you
started drinking heavy.

14:03.792 --> 14:06.250
Caught a DUI blocks
from where Mike was shot.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.375
I was at a bar
in the neighborhood.

14:08.458 --> 14:11.542
Desperate to know
why your boy had to die.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.875
No one would have blamed
you for going after him.

14:13.959 --> 14:16.458
I didn't have to go after him.

14:16.542 --> 14:17.667
He came to me.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.417
(Mike)
'Ma'am.'

14:25.500 --> 14:29.208
I just want to tell you how
honored I was to know your son.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.959
Kevin was an inspiration.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.500
Thank you.

14:38.917 --> 14:40.125
He want to make sure
the body's still
cold?

14:40.208 --> 14:41.500
Just offering
his condolences.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.625
- He has no right.
- Don't make a scene.

14:43.709 --> 14:44.959
Jerry.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.500
Ethan, right?

14:51.583 --> 14:52.583
Yeah.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.375
Your brother talked
a lot about you.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.083
(Mike)
'I'm sure that
everybody's telling you'

14:58.166 --> 14:59.458
you got to be
strong for your pop

14:59.542 --> 15:01.959
and that you
got big shoes to fill.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.041
None of that answers any
of your questions, right?

15:04.125 --> 15:07.291
About why this all
had to happen?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.792
I wish I could tell you.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.375
I can't.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.000
No one can.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.458
But if you ever get sad
about your brother..

15:18.208 --> 15:20.041
...I want you to remember this.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.417
Sorry. Uh.

15:27.166 --> 15:30.125
Take your time.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.458
He, um..

15:33.750 --> 15:38.166
He told my son Ethan that..

15:38.250 --> 15:39.291
he shouldn't feel sad

15:39.375 --> 15:41.709
about never seeing Kevin again.

15:41.792 --> 15:47.375
Because every time he saw a
soldier on TV, in the news

15:47.458 --> 15:49.959
on the street.

15:50.041 --> 15:52.875
Anywhere, that..

15:55.250 --> 15:58.083
that he was seeing
a piece of Kevin..

16:00.291 --> 16:02.834
That Kevin was now

16:02.917 --> 16:04.625
a part of something bigger.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.125
You know..

16:11.208 --> 16:14.917
I might...not have agreed

16:15.000 --> 16:18.041
with Mike that much
but what he said

16:18.125 --> 16:21.750
stays with me today.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.250
It's how I get by.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.542
(Kat)
'Got ballistics on the guns'

16:29.625 --> 16:32.083
'Rush and Valens
took from Jerry Harkin.'

16:32.166 --> 16:33.291
No match on the murder weapon.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.291
What about DNA
from the crime scene?

16:35.375 --> 16:36.500
Inconclusive.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.166
No traces found
on the army ski cap

16:38.250 --> 16:40.834
or on the pieces of
jewelry found by Mike's body.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.083
The Army came through
on Mike's recruiting files

16:43.166 --> 16:44.917
and cell records from 2005.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.208
The night of his murder,
he received several calls

16:47.291 --> 16:49.417
from a disposable cell phone.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.083
A burner phone like that
is sold over the counter.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.208
No way to trace it unless
we get the serial number.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.709
Well, contact the manufacturer.

16:55.792 --> 16:56.917
Find the store that sold it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.208
Whatever you need to
convince them to help.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.083
I'll get on it.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.250
Hey, boss.

17:02.333 --> 17:04.458
Mike took meticulous
notes on his recruits.

17:04.542 --> 17:07.208
Who needed money, which ones
had
trouble in school.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.500
(John)
'Any of these guys look good
for the pawnshop break-in?'

17:09.583 --> 17:10.750
Took the names of recruits

17:10.834 --> 17:12.250
cross-checked
with criminal records.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.917
Trey "Meathead" Newman.
One of Mike's prospects

17:15.000 --> 17:17.917
before he got popped for the
first of many felony arrests.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.417
"Burglary. Assault."
"Burglary" again.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.083
Meathead had
a thing for smash-and-grabs.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.375
Just like our pawnshop.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.458
Serving eight to twelve
up in Frackville.

17:25.542 --> 17:28.291
- Thought I'd drop by.
- Send my regards.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.250
(Kat)
'You had options
as a teenager, Trey.'

17:32.333 --> 17:34.333
Career soldier on one hand.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.542
Career criminal on the other.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.041
How the benefits compare?

17:38.125 --> 17:39.917
- Ain't no thing.
- You had a chance, though.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.291
With Mike Donley's help,
you could have been
something.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.041
You want something from me?

17:44.125 --> 17:45.500
What do you
know about the pawnshop

17:45.583 --> 17:46.834
break-in on 6th Street?

17:46.917 --> 17:48.583
I know pawnshops is small time.

17:48.667 --> 17:52.000
And you just scream
big time, Meathead.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.000
That's why we're here.

17:53.083 --> 17:56.166
Murder's as big as it gets.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.959
Sergeant Mike
was a pain in my ass.

18:00.041 --> 18:00.959
But I didn't kill him.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.500
Maybe he pushed too hard.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.500
- Made you push back.
- Pushed? No!

18:06.583 --> 18:08.208
I was being pulled another way.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.917
Come on, Trey. You can
do it, man. Stay on my hip.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.041
I can't.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.542
Hey. Come on.
Look me in the eye, man.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.417
Do not give up on me because
I will not give up on you.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
You understand?
Come on.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.041
There you go. There you go.
You're doing it.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.667
Oh, look at you.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.166
Hey, come on, man.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.500
You got something
belonging to us.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.417
Trey ain't not gonna
be
needing no army.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.458
He already got one.

18:38.542 --> 18:40.333
6th Street Mafia.

18:40.417 --> 18:41.917
In for life.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.834
I don't think so.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.834
It's your funeral.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.208
Go for it.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.583
Sergeant Mike, chill!

19:05.667 --> 19:07.417
(Trey)
'I'm serious, man.'

19:07.500 --> 19:09.917
'You're hurting him.
Stop it.'

19:11.375 --> 19:13.250
You okay?

19:13.333 --> 19:15.500
Bumper?

19:15.583 --> 19:17.417
You and me gonna be
having a reckoning.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.041
Come find me.
I ain't running.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.417
(Mike)
'Army will shape you up.'

19:25.542 --> 19:27.875
That look
in Sergeant Mike's eyes

19:28.000 --> 19:29.792
when he was squeezing
Bumper's throat.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.375
The guy had some demons.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.959
Bumper?

19:33.041 --> 19:34.083
You mean Bobby Kerns?

19:34.166 --> 19:35.583
Yeah, that's right.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.583
Sergeant Mike made
life hard for me

19:37.667 --> 19:39.208
with all that karate crap.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.875
They would have made me pay for
it if I didn't quit training.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.083
What about Bumper?

19:43.166 --> 19:44.792
I got busted
a couple weeks
later.

19:44.875 --> 19:45.917
Lost track of him.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.583
He the type to go
looking for
payback?

19:47.667 --> 19:50.083
Getting punked like that?
On 6th Street?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.166
Would have been a necessity.

19:57.041 --> 19:58.083
(Rush)
'I thought Bobby Kerns'

19:58.166 --> 19:59.500
had a clean record.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.542
Till we got the DA
to open his juvie file.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.333
A dozen arrests
before his 17th birthday.

20:04.417 --> 20:06.750
Something
he neglected to tell us.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.500
Past isn't the
only thing he lied about.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.917
Spoke to Army CID.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.583
Bobby's alibi for Mike
and himself fell through.

20:12.667 --> 20:15.125
He wasn't on the
11:00 P.M. bus to Fort Bragg.

20:15.208 --> 20:16.750
'Took the 5:00 A.M. instead.'

20:16.834 --> 20:19.792
Means he had plenty of time
to
rob the pawnshop. Kill Mike.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.542
Why would Bobby bring us
the case if he was involved?

20:22.625 --> 20:23.709
Sometimes people
need to confess.

20:23.792 --> 20:26.667
They just
don't know how to do
it.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.000
Hello?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.500
I'm on my way.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.291
Everything okay, Lil?

20:34.375 --> 20:36.417
Yeah. Um..

20:36.500 --> 20:38.250
I just got
to take care of something.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.333
Dad!

20:49.417 --> 20:50.709
Atlantic City.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.041
Nothing happened.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.917
My car got towed.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.291
Well, it's not my fault

20:57.375 --> 20:59.458
that the impound lot
doesn't open until the
morning.

20:59.542 --> 21:01.500
You're up at 6:00 A.M.
with me to go pick it up.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.041
And pay for it.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.875
Fine. I won, like,
500 bucks anyway.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.583
With money
you stole from me.

21:06.667 --> 21:09.250
Maybe this is a conversation
you two can have in the
morning.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.417
Easy for you to say.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.959
You don't have to
think about his future.

21:12.041 --> 21:15.000
Then maybe just not
inside my car at 2:00
A.M.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.667
If Cornell admissions finds
out
'bout your little adventure

21:18.750 --> 21:20.333
they'll rescind
your acceptance like this.

21:20.417 --> 21:23.208
So what? I'm not
going there anyway.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.667
I wanna be a cop.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.166
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.166
What's ridiculous
about being a cop?

21:30.250 --> 21:32.834
I meant for him.
Oh, but it's okay for me?

21:32.917 --> 21:35.083
Don't be defensive, Lilly.
I'm not attacking you.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.208
No, it's just my job.

21:36.291 --> 21:38.583
Which, by the way,
is how we found
him.

21:38.667 --> 21:41.583
Oh, I should have guessed that
you'd be the one to narc me
out.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.041
We waited two hours
outside that casino for
you.

21:44.125 --> 21:45.667
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be taking the bus
home.

21:45.750 --> 21:46.959
Gee, thanks a lot.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.542
- Watch your tone.
- Or what, dad?

21:48.625 --> 21:51.333
You'll walk out on me too?

21:58.333 --> 21:59.959
Inside!

22:06.041 --> 22:07.917
What are you waiting for?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.458
You stood me
up four times for dinner.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.917
Least you can do is
try my lemon chicken.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.458
Come on. Let's go.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.417
Please, help yourself.

22:30.291 --> 22:32.166
There you go.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.041
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.458
Well, now..

22:41.083 --> 22:42.917
...don't we make
<i>tableau?</i>

22:45.208 --> 22:48.000
I'm sorry that it took such
a dramatic act of stupidity

22:48.083 --> 22:50.208
on my son's part
to finally get you
here.

22:50.291 --> 22:52.166
- Mom!
- Napkin?

22:52.250 --> 22:56.083
It does gives me an
opportunity to clear the
air.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.125
'For the last few months,
I sat back while you and
Paul'

22:59.208 --> 23:01.709
participated in this
excruciating ritual

23:01.792 --> 23:06.792
of...secret
meetings,
intrigue, angst.

23:06.875 --> 23:08.125
'Four perfectly ruined'

23:08.208 --> 23:09.875
pot roasts later, here we are.

23:09.959 --> 23:11.875
- Celeste.
- 'No, I'm not done.'

23:11.959 --> 23:14.625
I know you've had
some hard times.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.417
Your mother, God rest her soul

23:16.500 --> 23:17.792
'your work.'

23:17.875 --> 23:20.542
But honestly,
we all have something,
right?

23:20.625 --> 23:22.375
It's really no excuse.

23:22.458 --> 23:26.125
I'm thrilled that you've
been spending time with
Finn.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.125
And despite my husband's

23:28.208 --> 23:32.000
unfathomable recent
behavior, he is too.

23:32.083 --> 23:34.417
But the drama stops tonight.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.250
'Hmm?'

23:38.333 --> 23:40.041
We're family.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.417
Full stop.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.083
That means birthdays, holidays

23:44.166 --> 23:47.000
hospital visits,
God forbid,
funerals.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.667
The whole thing.
Whether you like it or not

23:48.750 --> 23:51.667
Lilly Rush,
you are tied to us for
good.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.208
Are we clear?

23:55.291 --> 23:56.625
Okay.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.667
Hey, Bumper.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.083
Nice to see you again.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.667
Unfortunately, you left
some key information

24:13.750 --> 24:15.667
out of your story
last time we talked.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.166
Juvie record for one.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.250
Assault, robbery,
weapons possession.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.583
What does that have
to do with anything?

24:20.667 --> 24:22.458
Where were you when
the Prestige Pawnshop

24:22.542 --> 24:23.667
was broken into?

24:23.750 --> 24:24.834
At the bus station,
like I told you.

24:24.917 --> 24:27.041
See, now that's a lie, Bobby.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.709
You missed
the 11:00 P.M.
bus.

24:28.792 --> 24:30.083
I'm going to ask you again.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.709
Where were you
when the burglary went down?

24:32.792 --> 24:35.583
- At the bus station.
- 'Yeah, 5:00 A.M.'

24:35.667 --> 24:37.583
That gives you plenty of
time out there on the street.

24:37.667 --> 24:40.041
(Lilly)
'Oh, we got witnesses
remember you that night'

24:40.125 --> 24:41.250
'looking for Mike.'

24:41.333 --> 24:44.291
Went to the gym,
neighborhood diner

24:44.375 --> 24:45.667
'but what happened?'

24:46.959 --> 24:48.709
Oh, I had a look
at Mike's files.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.750
You were his favorite recruit.

24:52.834 --> 24:53.875
Thought of you like family.

24:53.959 --> 24:54.959
(Lilly)
'So the question is'

24:55.041 --> 24:56.000
what went down between

24:56.083 --> 24:57.417
you and your brother?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.375
I brought this to you.

24:59.458 --> 25:00.875
Why would I do that
if I was involved?

25:00.959 --> 25:03.208
Guilt, Bobby,
plain and simple.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.458
I didn't make the 11:00 P.M. bus

25:08.542 --> 25:11.000
because Mike
was supposed to take me

25:11.083 --> 25:11.959
but he never showed.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.875
- Why?
- He changed.

25:13.959 --> 25:15.583
Started missing appointments

25:15.667 --> 25:17.333
losing his temper.

25:17.417 --> 25:18.583
He wasn't the same guy I knew.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.417
Did you do something about it?

25:21.500 --> 25:22.750
I tried.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.083
Staff Sergeant Donley?

25:27.166 --> 25:28.291
Bobby.

25:28.375 --> 25:29.375
Hey.

25:29.458 --> 25:30.917
You okay?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.458
Just having a drink.

25:32.542 --> 25:33.458
You want one?

25:33.542 --> 25:35.750
Missed our morning workout.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.917
'Sorry.'

25:38.000 --> 25:39.542
I was, um..

25:41.458 --> 25:43.250
I went to the barber today.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.500
Old friend of mine.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.500
He gave me this letter
from his son Roberto.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.709
I ever tell you about Roberto?

25:51.792 --> 25:54.125
First recruit I ever signed.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.750
Ah, Roberto is with
the Corps of
Engineers.

25:56.834 --> 25:58.959
Doing water
purification in
Iraq.

25:59.041 --> 26:02.166
An IED embedded
in some scrap
metal..

26:02.250 --> 26:03.125
...went off.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.542
Roberto was caught in the blast.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.291
Lost his legs.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.625
So Roberto writes this letter..

26:11.709 --> 26:13.083
...to his dad

26:13.166 --> 26:14.625
telling him to thank me

26:14.709 --> 26:17.208
for giving him
the opportunity to
serve.

26:20.792 --> 26:23.792
His dad's...broke up.

26:28.041 --> 26:30.208
And I just don't got the words.

26:30.291 --> 26:32.000
Like you say, there's
always casualties in war.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.333
'Bobby.'

26:36.583 --> 26:39.375
I do not want to have
to go to your funeral.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.750
I'll be fine, Staff Sergeant..

26:41.834 --> 26:43.875
...but you need some coffee.

26:45.166 --> 26:47.000
I'll make a pot.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.333
He said he'd
sober up and go home

26:52.417 --> 26:53.333
but I could tell..

26:53.417 --> 26:55.500
He was living there.

26:56.959 --> 26:58.333
When was this?

26:58.417 --> 26:59.834
- Day before he died.
- Why didn't you tell us?

26:59.917 --> 27:01.000
If I'd told you
about it you
wouldn't

27:01.083 --> 27:02.166
have looked into the case.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.834
You don't know that.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.500
People think he was
some kind of
statistic

27:08.583 --> 27:11.083
collateral damage
for the war at
home.

27:11.166 --> 27:13.959
Staff Sergeant Donley's
a better man than I'll ever
be.

27:15.250 --> 27:18.625
If he's some kind of statistic..

27:18.709 --> 27:20.667
...what will I become?

27:20.750 --> 27:23.083
So Mike's living out
of the recruiting station

27:23.166 --> 27:26.458
the week before he was killed,
how come his wife Kristen
claims

27:26.542 --> 27:29.709
they were up in the Poconos
on a belated honeymoon?

27:29.792 --> 27:32.458
- Bad memory?
- More like selective.

27:32.542 --> 27:34.500
Took a road trip to the
cabin where she was
staying.

27:34.583 --> 27:37.333
Manager remembers her.
She came up alone.

27:37.417 --> 27:38.375
Fits Bobby's story.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.166
But it didn't stay that way.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.041
A man joined her
the last night.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.834
Showed the manager
a photo of Mike.

27:43.917 --> 27:46.917
Let me guess.
Wasn't him.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.375
(Kat)
'I admire you, Kristen.'

27:53.458 --> 27:54.834
Choosing to marry Mike

27:54.917 --> 27:56.083
being a soldier's wife.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.000
It wasn't a choice.
I loved him.

27:58.083 --> 28:00.583
Even though you
knew that with
him..

28:00.667 --> 28:03.542
...the army always came first.

28:03.625 --> 28:06.083
He believed in something.
I believed in him.

28:06.166 --> 28:09.208
Sure. But all those
months with Mike
gone.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.166
- You didn't stray once?
- No.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.417
How about after he got back?

28:17.417 --> 28:19.291
Excuse me.
I was loyal to my husband.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.417
Not up in the Poconos.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.875
Spent your honeymoon
with another man.

28:23.959 --> 28:26.583
Look, Mike moves
you to a strange
city

28:26.667 --> 28:29.250
no friends, no money
and he was never
around.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.750
- You're only human.
- You're wrong.

28:33.834 --> 28:36.208
Mike must have found
out
what you were doing.

28:36.291 --> 28:37.166
'You were scared.'

28:37.250 --> 28:38.834
Hell, Mike was airborne, right?

28:38.917 --> 28:40.959
A professional killer. Would
have been ugly if he caught
you.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.625
Mike wasn't like that.

28:42.709 --> 28:45.125
(Will)
'You said yourself
he had changed.'

28:45.208 --> 28:46.750
He was tense, distant.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.625
Could have been
afraid for your
life.

28:48.709 --> 28:50.000
Maybe your boyfriend

28:50.083 --> 28:52.291
decided to do
something
to him, self-defense.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.125
I never would have hurt Mike.

28:54.208 --> 28:57.959
The only reason he found out
is because I told him.

28:58.041 --> 29:00.834
We'd just talk, you know?
We'd have lunch.

29:00.917 --> 29:03.417
It was nothing physical.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.500
Until..

29:07.709 --> 29:09.500
...I stayed true to you
through two deployments

29:09.583 --> 29:10.959
to Afghanistan, Mike!

29:11.041 --> 29:13.625
Through every other thing
the army's thrown at us.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.375
Listen to me!

29:16.458 --> 29:18.709
I've asked for nothing!

29:18.792 --> 29:21.250
Except for three
lousy days up in the Poconos

29:21.333 --> 29:23.709
for a honeymoon that we
should have had five years
ago.

29:23.792 --> 29:24.834
You couldn't even give me that.

29:24.917 --> 29:25.834
So this is my fault?

29:25.917 --> 29:27.667
That's not what I'm saying.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.542
When you got back
from Afghanistan

29:31.625 --> 29:34.000
I thought that
we'd be able to spend time.

29:36.583 --> 29:39.000
- It's like you're still
gone.
- That's crap.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.667
That is crap, and you know it.

29:40.750 --> 29:43.333
You're in a constant state
of mourning, Mike, for Johnny.

29:43.417 --> 29:45.000
You write
these speeches about him.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.166
You give away his things
like they're relics.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.500
I honor him!

29:48.583 --> 29:50.208
You didn't even like the guy!

29:50.291 --> 29:51.959
He drove you crazy!

29:53.041 --> 29:54.250
But you feel responsible.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.792
I am responsible.

29:58.625 --> 30:01.542
You are a hero, Mike.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.458
Nobody gives more than you do.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.208
Every day you're
sending support over there

30:05.291 --> 30:07.542
so that Johnny won't
have died for nothing.

30:07.625 --> 30:09.291
That's, that's what I thought.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.458
Yeah, but come on.

30:11.542 --> 30:13.709
Be honest.

30:13.792 --> 30:15.542
I used him..

30:15.625 --> 30:17.083
...to meet quotas.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.166
To put..

30:19.250 --> 30:21.834
...fresh bodies
in the foxholes.

30:21.917 --> 30:24.667
If that's how you feel..

30:24.750 --> 30:27.583
...then quit.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.542
Not an option.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.333
Then don't.

30:31.417 --> 30:34.291
But please do something
because I want my husband back.

30:37.917 --> 30:41.041
Come on. You remember
when we got married?

30:41.125 --> 30:43.375
That first deployment,
it was nine months, remember?

30:43.458 --> 30:45.333
And we agreed
if we could survive that

30:45.417 --> 30:47.333
we could survive anything

30:47.417 --> 30:49.375
no matter what.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.875
Do you still believe that?

30:54.667 --> 30:56.041
Answer one question

30:59.667 --> 31:01.875
Who was it?

31:06.208 --> 31:09.917
I told him, and he
walked right out the door.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.917
Last time I ever saw him.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.208
Night he died?

31:15.417 --> 31:17.125
My entire life..

31:17.208 --> 31:19.709
...comes down
to one stupid decision.

31:21.667 --> 31:24.250
I'd give anything
to take it back.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.542
Who was it, Kristen?

31:26.625 --> 31:29.333
The man you were seeing?

31:32.417 --> 31:35.333
Mike's boss, Sergeant Gomez.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.625
You familiar
with the term "Jody,"

31:43.709 --> 31:45.125
First Sergeant Gomez?

31:45.208 --> 31:47.875
It's what we call a man or
woman
who's cheating with a spouse

31:47.959 --> 31:49.667
of a soldier who's overseas.

31:49.750 --> 31:52.000
It can't get much
lower than that, right?

31:52.083 --> 31:55.792
But you didn't
even
have the decency

31:55.875 --> 31:57.208
to wait for Mike to deploy

31:57.291 --> 31:59.083
before going after his wife.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.917
Where's the honor in that?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.166
There is none.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.875
- I made a mistake.
- 'About the affair.'

32:04.959 --> 32:06.250
What about the murder?

32:06.333 --> 32:08.041
So you and Kristen got
your stories straight.

32:08.125 --> 32:09.667
Said the same
thing about Mike when he died.

32:09.750 --> 32:12.000
He was distant,
tense, not himself.

32:12.083 --> 32:15.000
I did not lie about that.
Mike Mike was suffering.

32:17.875 --> 32:21.166
And your answer
was to get him out of the way

32:21.250 --> 32:23.166
so you could
have his wife to
yourself.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.000
You recognize this?

32:25.083 --> 32:26.291
Orders for deployment to Iraq.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.834
For Mike Donley.
Who processed them?

32:28.917 --> 32:30.542
It's right there at
the bottom of the
page.

32:30.625 --> 32:32.792
I did.

32:32.875 --> 32:35.375
See, if Mike
reported you for the affair

32:35.458 --> 32:37.375
you would have lost your job
at the recruiting station.

32:37.458 --> 32:38.667
You don't get it.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.792
- Mike requested Iraq.
- He wanted to go?

32:41.875 --> 32:44.500
He was tired of seeing his
kids getting hurt and killed.

32:44.583 --> 32:45.542
Couldn't take it anymore.

32:45.625 --> 32:46.625
I didn't wanna lose my

32:46.709 --> 32:47.667
best recruiter

32:47.750 --> 32:50.208
but it was what he needed.

32:50.291 --> 32:51.208
I was trying to help.

32:51.291 --> 32:52.375
I'm sure you're the last person

32:52.458 --> 32:54.333
he wanted help from.

32:54.417 --> 32:58.041
At first, I thought
he was going to kill
me.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.333
Do it, Mike! I deserve it!

33:13.083 --> 33:14.709
I'm sorry,
man.
I messed up.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.875
I'll get a transfer.
I'll make it scarce.

33:17.959 --> 33:19.208
You and Kristen can work it out.

33:19.291 --> 33:24.750
How am I supposed
to work it out?

33:24.834 --> 33:26.917
I don't know, man. I've
been divorced three
times.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.333
All I know is soldiering.

33:36.375 --> 33:39.166
She expects
me to come back home..

33:39.250 --> 33:40.625
...and be okay.

33:43.125 --> 33:45.417
They gave me a medal.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.375
Called me a hero.

33:47.458 --> 33:48.750
Still don't know why.

33:48.834 --> 33:51.834
You held off an
enemy ambush for two days.

33:51.917 --> 33:53.959
Or maybe I walked us into it.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.083
'Trying to rewrite history?'

33:55.166 --> 33:57.750
I read the after-action report.

33:57.834 --> 34:00.417
You and Johnny
were wounded, pinned down.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.625
Johnny didn't want to move.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.625
I ordered him.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.250
You made a call.

34:06.333 --> 34:09.583
I dragged him down
that mountain inch by inch..

34:09.667 --> 34:11.583
...both of us losing blood.

34:13.834 --> 34:16.208
After a while,
he got real quiet.

34:16.291 --> 34:19.583
Started staring off at nothing.

34:19.667 --> 34:22.041
You know the last thing
he said before he died?

34:23.250 --> 34:24.875
"It's so beautiful."

34:27.625 --> 34:29.375
What do you think he saw?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.625
All I saw
were those damn mountains.

34:33.709 --> 34:35.000
You didn't kill him.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.959
They shot me twice.
I should have died.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.667
But you didn't. He did.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.291
'You're just
one soldier, Mike.'

34:41.375 --> 34:42.667
You gotta know your
place in this thing.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.750
My place is over there..

34:44.834 --> 34:47.291
...with those kids I sent.

34:51.750 --> 34:52.875
I know.

34:58.834 --> 34:59.959
It's your orders to Iraq.

35:00.041 --> 35:03.000
You deploy in 48 hours.

35:03.083 --> 35:06.125
Whatever it is you're
looking for, I hope you find
it.

35:12.125 --> 35:15.000
Staff Sergeant Donley.

35:16.875 --> 35:18.834
Just...stay there.

35:20.458 --> 35:21.875
Gotta go.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.208
That was the last I saw him.

35:30.291 --> 35:32.750
I never spoke
to Kristen again, either

35:32.834 --> 35:34.125
not even at the funeral.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.500
So why didn't
you report yourself

35:35.583 --> 35:37.959
to your officer in charge?
Take your punishment?

35:38.041 --> 35:40.709
Finding more kids
to send over there

35:40.792 --> 35:44.000
instead of me going
over to fight myself

35:44.083 --> 35:47.166
that's my punishment.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.834
Who was on the phone?

35:50.417 --> 35:52.500
Always assumed it was Kristen.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.625
So Mike wasn't
putting Bobby on the

35:55.709 --> 35:57.333
bus to Fort Bragg
the night of his murder.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.625
The guy was confronting
First Sergeant Gomez.

35:59.709 --> 36:01.583
When he was supposedly
breaking into the
pawnshop.

36:01.667 --> 36:04.208
11:30, he gets the call.
Leaves the recruiting
station.

36:04.291 --> 36:05.709
'Never seen alive again.'

36:05.792 --> 36:07.041
The phone records say
that call came from the same

36:07.125 --> 36:08.750
disposable
phone called Mike's cell

36:08.834 --> 36:09.959
five times that night.

36:10.041 --> 36:11.500
Someone desperate to reach him.

36:11.583 --> 36:13.208
I tracked the
cell's serial
number.

36:13.291 --> 36:15.542
It was purchased a few
days before Mike's death

36:15.625 --> 36:17.709
at a convenience store
on 6th and Girard.

36:17.792 --> 36:19.000
That's close
to where Mike was killed.

36:19.083 --> 36:20.250
Yeah, guess who
used to worked there

36:20.333 --> 36:22.417
part-time after school.

36:23.834 --> 36:24.917
(Lilly)
'You had a tough childhood'

36:25.000 --> 36:26.083
'didn't you, Victoria?'

36:26.166 --> 36:28.500
Your family who
didn't give a crap

36:28.583 --> 36:31.250
a dead-end job
at the bodega

36:31.333 --> 36:32.875
no hope of a future.

36:32.959 --> 36:36.417
Doesn't matter where you been,
only matters where you're
going.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.000
I like that.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.000
- Learn it from Mike?
- I guess so.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.750
'The Army was
your way out.'

36:41.834 --> 36:44.333
Education, benefits, bonus.

36:44.417 --> 36:46.291
- 'How much was it again?'
- 20,000.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.291
You just had to wait
till your 18th birthday.

36:49.792 --> 36:51.500
Your life was going to change.

36:54.709 --> 36:56.125
Recognize this?

36:56.208 --> 36:58.375
- No.
- You barely looked.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.750
Take your time.

37:07.709 --> 37:09.291
Ah, it's a pretty piece.

37:09.375 --> 37:12.083
'Tasteful.
Not cheap either.'

37:12.166 --> 37:14.917
You could never
afford it on minimum wage.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.291
Well, when this is done,
I could do you a solid.

37:17.375 --> 37:18.333
Make it disappear.

37:18.417 --> 37:19.333
Look, what's your point?

37:19.417 --> 37:21.125
Remember the Prestige Pawnshop?

37:21.208 --> 37:24.333
You'd go in there all the
time
and try this necklace on.

37:24.417 --> 37:25.959
The owner recognized your photo.

37:26.041 --> 37:26.959
If you say so.

37:27.041 --> 37:28.000
Minute you got that bonus

37:28.083 --> 37:29.375
you were going to buy it.

37:29.458 --> 37:31.792
Only problem you didn't pass
that Army Entrance Exam.

37:31.875 --> 37:35.125
Wasn't a big deal. I retook
the
test. Passed the second time.

37:35.208 --> 37:36.875
'Well, after they
lowered their requirements.'

37:36.959 --> 37:39.959
Army was hungry for recruits,
no matter how unqualified.

37:40.041 --> 37:43.375
Ma'am, I am
an outstanding
soldier.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.709
Now, but four years ago

37:44.792 --> 37:46.667
you were an angry little girl
looking to lash out.

37:46.750 --> 37:49.208
You saw this necklace
that you could never afford.

37:49.291 --> 37:51.125
You decided
to just take it.

37:54.542 --> 37:56.000
Neighborhood's dangerous.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.834
Stores are
always
getting robbed.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.750
Is that why your boss
at the bodega kept a gun

37:59.834 --> 38:02.333
behind the counter?

38:04.458 --> 38:05.583
Ran it through ballistics.

38:05.667 --> 38:08.375
It's the same gun
that killed Mike.

38:08.458 --> 38:09.709
If you respect
that uniform at all

38:09.792 --> 38:13.250
you're gonna
tell me what happened.

38:13.333 --> 38:16.166
Don't you see

38:16.250 --> 38:18.291
that I'm taking on his work

38:18.375 --> 38:20.750
helping kids change their lives?

38:20.834 --> 38:22.208
It's got to count for something.

38:22.291 --> 38:23.250
Sure, it does.

38:23.333 --> 38:25.125
So be a good soldier,
Victoria.

38:25.208 --> 38:28.041
Tell me the truth!

38:35.792 --> 38:38.542
I got the gun.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.583
I smashed the
window in the
store.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.750
I knew right
away
I messed up.

38:52.041 --> 38:54.542
That's why I called Mike.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.792
'Cause you had
no one else to call.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.750
'Cause I was
trying
to make it right.

39:02.834 --> 39:05.333
And he was gonna turn you in.

39:05.417 --> 39:08.166
Worse.

39:08.250 --> 39:11.041
He was gonna abandon me.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.125
(Mike)
'Victoria.'

39:19.041 --> 39:22.500
Victoria.

39:22.583 --> 39:26.000
Victoria. Hey, you okay?

39:26.083 --> 39:28.583
I ruined everything, Mike.
They're gonna lock me up.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.000
What happened?

39:30.083 --> 39:31.750
I broke into the pawnshop.

39:31.834 --> 39:33.417
I wanted this so bad.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.917
I just..

39:35.000 --> 39:36.917
What am I going to
do?
Cops are everywhere.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.750
How am I supposed to get home?

39:40.208 --> 39:41.750
You're gonna come clean, okay?

39:41.834 --> 39:43.458
We're gonna go to the cops.

39:43.542 --> 39:47.500
You're gonna give
the jewelry back.

39:47.583 --> 39:50.083
It's what soldiers do.

39:50.166 --> 39:51.834
But I'm not a soldier, Mike.

39:51.917 --> 39:53.291
Didn't they tell you?

39:53.375 --> 39:55.125
I failed the exam.

39:55.208 --> 39:56.625
You're gonna pass the next time.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.166
Not if I'm a felon.

39:58.250 --> 40:00.417
I will talk to
whoever I have to..

40:00.500 --> 40:01.417
...smooth it over.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.625
My word of honor, Victoria.

40:05.709 --> 40:07.917
I will clear
this up for you.

40:10.417 --> 40:11.542
Come on.

40:15.709 --> 40:17.625
You're gonna study
for the test again

40:17.709 --> 40:20.458
and you're gonna ace it.

40:20.542 --> 40:22.000
I'll even get some of the guys

40:22.083 --> 40:23.375
at the recruiting
station to tutor you.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.375
You can tutor me.

40:30.041 --> 40:31.417
Got my orders.

40:32.583 --> 40:35.458
I deploy Iraq in two days.

40:35.542 --> 40:37.333
What?

40:39.041 --> 40:41.667
- You can't leave.
- I have to, Victoria.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.834
I got to serve
with the kids I sent there.

40:43.917 --> 40:46.417
Who'll be with me?

40:46.500 --> 40:47.917
Victoria.

40:53.458 --> 40:54.792
My mom's kicking me out

40:54.875 --> 40:56.667
if I don't get that bonus money.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.917
- Where am I going to go?
- Put the gun down, okay?

41:00.000 --> 41:00.875
I will help you.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.208
How are you going to help me

41:02.291 --> 41:03.959
if you're not here?

41:04.041 --> 41:05.875
You don't care
about what happens!

41:05.959 --> 41:07.667
You're just trying
to get rid of me!

41:07.750 --> 41:09.125
Stop that, that is not true.

41:09.208 --> 41:11.583
I thought you believed in me,
but you're a liar.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.792
- Like everyone else!
- No, I..

41:30.333 --> 41:33.041
