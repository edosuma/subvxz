WEBVTT

00:00.877 --> 00:01.992
- Previously on "Killjoys"...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.376
- Johnny, this is Louella,
my sister.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.382
- It's headed up her arm.
- Help me.

00:09.385 --> 00:11.592
- What are you doing?

00:16.392 --> 00:17.632
- Banyon.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.349
- l was hoping
you'd show yourself.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.647
- Why aren't you healing?

00:24.650 --> 00:26.641
You're human.

00:28.321 --> 00:31.233
— What the hells?
- It's gone.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.276
- You blew up
all the other RAC stations?

00:33.284 --> 00:36.492
- When I kill her, I want her
to be completely alone.

00:36.496 --> 00:39.112
Like I was for years.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.711
Lucy: Nearing
Scarback Necropolis.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.462
Virgins don't prep this much
for wedding nights, D'av.

00:56.474 --> 00:57.463
It's morbid.

00:57.475 --> 00:59.466
- It's not morbid.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.513
It's ritual.

01:01.521 --> 01:04.308
Everything important
deserves a ritual.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.476
Smoothing the lapels,

01:06.484 --> 01:09.351
pressing the whites,
polishing the boots.

01:09.362 --> 01:10.818
All helps keep my mind off...

01:10.821 --> 01:12.812
- The fact that we're gonna
burn our dead?

01:12.823 --> 01:16.782
- Honor our dead.

01:16.786 --> 01:19.698
Are you drunk?

01:19.705 --> 01:22.788
- I'm trying.
It's not working.

01:24.377 --> 01:26.333
- No, thanks.
I'm super good.

01:31.551 --> 01:33.507
They died because
of the Hullen, Dutch.

01:33.511 --> 01:34.751
Not you.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.845
- What about Banyon?

01:37.848 --> 01:40.305
Gotcha.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.890
Point Dutch.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.725
- Banyon was a mistake.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.890
- I don't get
to make those anymore.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.889
Not with these stakes.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.891
- Well, what do you need to
make it through the day then?

01:49.902 --> 01:53.861
And don't say more alcohol.

01:53.864 --> 01:58.779
- I need to know
what's on the other side.

01:58.786 --> 02:02.620
Do we win?
Was it worth it?

02:10.339 --> 02:12.500
- You're having doubts.

02:17.847 --> 02:20.554
- I'm having doubts.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.423
- Well, knock it off,

02:22.435 --> 02:23.891
because we won't win,

02:23.894 --> 02:25.930
and it won't be worth it
if we fall apart now.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.645
They deserve better
than that from us.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.732
From you.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.476
- Tough love is supposed to have

02:33.487 --> 02:36.695
some actual love in it,
you know?

02:36.699 --> 02:38.530
- Sorry.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.944
Soldier D'avin
is kind of a dick.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.568
- No, I needed that.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.571
You're right.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.824
Just don't tell Johnny
that I'm scared.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.791
Okay?

02:51.422 --> 02:54.585
- Tap my heart.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.583
You know I neverjudge you.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.550
It's kind of our deal.

03:01.641 --> 03:03.848
Whoa.
- Whoa?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.716
- Dutch, |-|...
- No, no, forget it.

03:05.728 --> 03:08.470
It didn't even happen.
It didn't actually happen.

03:08.481 --> 03:12.850
- This would feel less awkward
if I walked in on actual sex.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.600
— Suit up.
We're leaving in five.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.477
- Dutch...
- Whatever you wanna say,

03:16.489 --> 03:17.854
pick another moment.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.856
- D'av, you there?
- Not a good time, Zeph.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.448
- But I know what's in
the Remnant.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.443
It's brain neocortex cells.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.866
- Neocortex, no way.
That's amazing.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.741
- I know, right?
And I think I can inject some...

03:29.752 --> 03:31.162
D'av?

03:31.170 --> 03:32.751
- What did Zeph
want to talk about?

03:32.755 --> 03:34.165
- I don't know,
stupid science stuff.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.629
- Hey.

03:35.633 --> 03:36.998
- Stupid biological
science stuff.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.965
- Pfft.
What a nerd.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.881
Lucy: Now clear to land
at elevator docking station.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.644
- Please proceed
to the elevator now.

03:54.652 --> 03:57.644
Announcing Kella Seyon,
Head of Land Trus.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.772
- Ugh, the Ninejust live for
these formal events, don't they?

04:00.783 --> 04:02.899
Anything to keep up appearances.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.901
- Yeah, I hate everyone
as a basic life philosophy,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.868
but if I can give them
the benefit of the doubt...

04:06.872 --> 04:10.490
- Melek Seyah Rinn,
Head of Land Rinn.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.867
- Look, we may need 'em.
- Since when?

04:12.878 --> 04:14.869
- Since you don't turn
a gaggle of bounty hunters

04:14.880 --> 04:16.836
into an army by saying please.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.503
We need training,
weapons, artillery...

04:19.510 --> 04:22.798
- Zia Seyah Tracius,
Head of Land Tracius.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.921
- So unless we get
the Company as a patron,

04:24.932 --> 04:26.923
this war will be over
before it starts.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.516
- Well, then Johnny
to the rescue.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.512
Got an ace in that hole.
Her.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.686
- Louella Seyah Simms,
Head of Land Simms.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.685
-Ace in the hole.
Care to be more specific?

04:38.696 --> 04:42.814
- That's Pawter's sister.
We're practically... we're family.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.032
She can help us get
the Nine families on board

04:45.035 --> 04:46.445
to fund the fight.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.700
— Shit.
- What is it?

04:50.708 --> 04:52.915
- Looks like you're gonna
be doing final salute.

04:52.918 --> 04:57.036
- What?
No way, that's your job.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.663
- So is dealing with the three
other RACs that exploded,

04:59.675 --> 05:02.917
unless you'd rather welcome
the refugees coming to join us?

05:02.928 --> 05:04.919
Didn't think so.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.546
- Look, if you don't want
to do this, just say the word.

05:11.562 --> 05:14.474
You can't keep
ignoring me, Dutch.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.395
Okay, that wasn't a challenge.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.814
— Hey, kiddo.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.029
- I think you mean
"Seyah Simms."

05:24.033 --> 05:25.989
- That's, uh...
That's a bit formal.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.824
- Is it?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.910
Address me properly
or I'll have you removed.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.950
- Louella...
- We're done here.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.580
- ln-laws, am I right?

05:41.592 --> 05:42.877
- Seyah Mankai Nenodall,

05:42.885 --> 05:44.125
Head of Land Nenodall.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.092
- Good luck up there.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.758
Don't let us down... Ace.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.927
- Please stand clear
of the closing doors.

05:56.774 --> 06:00.687
Now ascending to the Necropolis.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.900
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

06:05.908 --> 06:07.068
J“ Ooh, ooh

06:08.661 --> 06:11.118
J' Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh J‘

06:12.164 --> 06:13.950
J“ Ooh, ooh.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.910
- For life, in a word,
is change,

06:18.921 --> 06:21.833
and we must embrace that change

06:21.841 --> 06:24.332
in all its forms,

06:24.343 --> 06:26.334
even death.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.051
But there is comfort.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.046
There is a constant.

06:30.057 --> 06:34.050
The Nine,
who are and will forever be

06:34.061 --> 06:36.677
guardians of the Quad.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.022
Dutch: I'll go get help.
I'll be back.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.833
— Today we honor
these five Admirals,

06:59.837 --> 07:02.954
but mourn the souls of
all those who died on the RACs.

07:02.965 --> 07:07.174
Blame is as easy
as it is useless.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.840
They died fighting.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.804
They died with honor.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.727
And today we send them home.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.183
They took no bribes.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.685
They took no sides.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.653
All: The Warrant was all.

07:34.079 --> 07:38.118
— Only when a seed dies
does it finally bear fruit.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.663
All: Praise the trees.
May the roots bind us all.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.822
- I haven't been human
in a long time.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.037
But if I recall,

09:00.040 --> 09:05.285
unplanned sleepovers
are considered quite rude.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.332
- Yes, but this is a big ship,

09:08.340 --> 09:11.207
and my bed is very far away.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.083
So what is a girl to do?

09:13.095 --> 09:16.087
Besides, one good turn
deserves another,

09:16.098 --> 09:19.010
and it's your turn.
Yes, I'm counting.

09:19.018 --> 09:22.761
- No, I need to go to my lab.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.103
The sample Fell Squad
collected from Jaqobis

09:25.107 --> 09:28.349
is making me rethink
my Red 17 experiments.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.023
I'm close to something big.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.857
- What?

09:36.869 --> 09:40.111
- I'm sorry, it's just...

09:40.122 --> 09:42.864
Is it me or is
Hullen sex amazing?

09:45.002 --> 09:46.788
- Neither.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.047
It's me.

09:52.051 --> 09:56.090
- Was she here the whole time?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.712
- Yes, that's herjob.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.849
- Okay.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.093
I'm into it.

10:08.067 --> 10:11.355
Oh, it's good to be queen.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.101
- The Hullen are still coming,

10:13.113 --> 10:14.853
but this time,
they're bringing a war.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.821
- A war we intend to win.
- War's not cheap.

10:16.825 --> 10:20.033
- And neither is freedom,
which is what this war is about.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.287
- Spare some time
for an old friend?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.873
- When were we ever new friends?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.208
- My dear, I've spent my life

10:28.212 --> 10:29.577
sniping with vipers
and sycophants.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.328
I'm tired and | feel ill.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.331
Can we just talk?

10:33.342 --> 10:35.207
- What I don't understand
is why they're coming.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.585
With no Arkyn plasma,
there's no reason for war.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.053
- We picked a fight.
- Oh, I see.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.048
The little puppy nipped
at the big dog,

10:42.059 --> 10:44.391
and now it wants to hide
behind its owners legs.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.975
- I think he's talking
aboutyou.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.310
- I'm talking about all of you.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.179
It's been a rough year
on Westerley.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.898
The Company had to restructure.
- Don't care.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.063
The Hullen aren't going anywhere
and neither is this fight.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.062
It's about time the Nine
kicked in their share.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.064
- Our share?
- Your ancestors' deal

10:58.075 --> 11:00.191
with the Hullen is the reason
why we even have this problem.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.067
- That wasn't a deal,
it was survival.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.070
You would have done
the exact same.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.072
- What if the deal is off and
you're not protected anymore?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.244
You need us.
-And you need to understand

11:08.252 --> 11:10.368
that the Nine
are not getting involved.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.917
The Hullen aren't our problem
anymore, praise the trees.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.165
We're done here.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.259
- They're just as vulnerable
as us now.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.925
Why wouldn't they help?

11:21.932 --> 11:23.923
- Whatever the reason,
there goes our shot.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.970
- The hell it does.
I'll have the Nine on board

11:25.978 --> 11:28.390
before the elevator
hits the landing dock.

11:28.397 --> 11:31.059
If I have to kill them
all to do it, lwill.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.899
- Descent to the loading dock
will commence momentarily.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.314
Please proceed
to the elevator now.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.279
- Aw, screw it.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.948
This is about Pawter, isn't it?

11:44.955 --> 11:46.445
- Just stop talking to me, John.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.242
- Look, maybe I shoulda come
to you after she died, but...

11:48.250 --> 11:50.161
- Just leave me alone, please.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.080
Louella, wait.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.452
- Please stand clear
of the closing doors.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.500
- Johnny, wait!
- Where are you going?

11:56.508 --> 12:01.172
— Now commencing descent
to the loading dock.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.387
- Looks like it's just me and...

12:03.390 --> 12:05.472
—All right, listen up.
- Me.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.966
- You may think the Hullen are
done with you, but they're not.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.390
- No, I'm not letting you use
this tragedy as a sales pitch.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.353
- Easy.
- Stay out of this, monk.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.439
- Your ancestors
made a deal with the Hullen

12:14.443 --> 12:16.149
so that they could
pillage the Quad.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.484
So this isn't a sales pitch.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.068
It's a godsdamned debt.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.233
- But also a sales pitch.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.197
We for sure need money.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.034
- Let me guess, we're not moving

12:30.042 --> 12:31.498
until you get it, right?

12:31.501 --> 12:34.334
- No, that wasn't us.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.249
- I suppose
that wasn't you either.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.417
- Okay, everybody stay calm.
Elevators start, elevators stop.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.211
It's just what they do.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.050
I'm sure it's a minor
malfunction. We'll get...

12:42.054 --> 12:43.464
Ah, see, there.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.847
- Seyah Melek!
- What's going on?

12:49.311 --> 12:51.051
- She's gone.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.473
- It must have been
a heart attack.

12:52.481 --> 12:54.187
- D'av, give me a hand.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.526
- Definitely not a heart attack.

13:44.283 --> 13:47.025
- Well, well, well.

13:48.245 --> 13:51.658
Looks like it's time
to get to work, Brynn.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.954
- It's about time.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.172
l was beginning to think
you'd disappeared...

14:02.175 --> 14:03.790
Oh.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.839
Well, this is interesting.

14:06.847 --> 14:10.010
Not entirely unexpected,
if I'm being honest,

14:10.017 --> 14:12.804
but interesting.

14:12.811 --> 14:16.019
Full disclosure, I do feel
a touch weird about it.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.186
Okay, that is definitely
not happening.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.899
- I couldn't agree more.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.939
-Aneela isn't here,
but she'll be back.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.859
- I know where Aneela is.
I'm not here for her.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.858
We're on a tight schedule,
so chop-chop.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.078
- Melek's been murdered.
- So who do you think did it?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.072
- Your guess is as good as mine.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.163
You need to get
this elevator moving, Johnny.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.204
- Well, it's gonna be tough.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.951
Because of the sun's radiation,
they kept the tech basic.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.169
Analog would be cute
if it wasn't so useless.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.834
- You don't know analog?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.752
- You know how to fire a musket?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.170
- Just do what you can,
but do it fast.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.964
We've got a killer in here.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.838
- Melek's dead? What?

14:50.849 --> 14:52.840
- Hey, it's all right.
Hey, it's okay.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.352
Everything's gonna be fine
once I get the elevator

14:54.353 --> 14:56.059
moving again somehow.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.850
Okay?
- Okay, okay.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.188
But I want to help.
- Great.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.057
What do you know
about elevators?

15:02.069 --> 15:03.400
- Um, there's five
on the estate,

15:03.403 --> 15:06.236
and if one breaks,
I call someone.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.900
- Okay, new plan.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.899
Uh, I'm gonna work
on the elevator,

15:09.910 --> 15:11.320
and you're work on figuring out
which one of the Nine

15:11.328 --> 15:14.195
would want Melek dead.
- Okay.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.821
- Let me show you
how to use this.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.788
- I think I know
how a stylus works.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.876
- It's also a taser.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.119
- You better show me.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.631
- What's all this?
- Self-protection.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.797
After Seyah Simms
and Seyah Kendry,

15:32.808 --> 15:34.799
the Nine are a bit
more cautious these days.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.843
- A stick, a dessert fork,
and a comb?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.230
This can't be everything.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.222
You people couldn't hurt
a fly with this stuff.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.770
- It's not everything. You
still haven't checked the monk.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.187
- Yeah, because I'm a monk.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.935
- A monk who had
a very heated exchange

15:46.947 --> 15:48.858
with Melek before
she turned up dead.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.196
Now, the Scarback
don't exactly enjoy

15:50.200 --> 15:52.031
the best reputation
amongst the Nine.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.696
I insist you check him.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.204
- Okay, let's just
get this over with

15:55.205 --> 15:58.914
before Sir Pompous McDickbag
pops a vessel.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.953
- Alvis.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.669
Don't bother.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.379
- In the control room, please.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.594
Open your stupid monk mouth

16:12.597 --> 16:14.508
and tell me what the hells
is going on.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.926
- You're accusing me of murder,
that's what.

16:15.934 --> 16:19.722
- I could never
accuse you of murder,

16:19.729 --> 16:21.640
because you're an attention
whore activist who would

16:21.648 --> 16:23.855
scream it from the rooftops
before I had a chance.

16:23.859 --> 16:25.895
- Well, that's not...
Good point.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.813
- But somebody on
this elevator did it, Alvis,

16:27.821 --> 16:31.609
and until I can figure out who,
you're gonna take the blame.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.483
We got you off death row once.
Let's not push your luck.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.701
- Nice to know you haven't
stopped looking out for me.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.742
- Some things never change.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.540
Ever

16:46.548 --> 16:48.504
Now talk.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.464
What were you and Melek
arguing about?

16:52.471 --> 16:54.883
- She came to me for Tolerance.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.506
- If you could skip
the cryptic shit, Alvis,

16:57.517 --> 16:59.758
I'd really appreciate it.

16:59.769 --> 17:03.637
- It's like asking a judge
for leniency before punishment.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.809
But I don't believe you can
buy your way out of penance.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.978
- She wanted to buy
her own Tolerance?

17:07.986 --> 17:10.443
- Yeah, it wasn'tjust for her.

17:10.447 --> 17:11.812
It was for the Nine.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.940
- For what?

17:14.951 --> 17:16.782
- She died before
she could tell me.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.573
All I know
is that whatever it is,

17:19.581 --> 17:21.697
it's pretty bad.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.868
And they haven't done it yet.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.753
- Hello?

17:28.757 --> 17:30.713
Hello?

17:35.847 --> 17:38.509
Where is everybody?

17:50.028 --> 17:52.940
I command you all come back.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.735
Now!

17:55.742 --> 17:57.698
Answer me!

18:02.791 --> 18:04.873
Kend ry.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.751
Oh, no.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.791
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.790
Not again.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.932
- Aneela.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.018
Lucy: John, are you
making any progress

18:29.025 --> 18:30.765
with your investigation?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.984
- Copper wire.
Who uses this anymore?

18:32.988 --> 18:36.025
I need lasers.
Maybe nanotubes.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.023
Maybe...

18:38.034 --> 18:39.990
Lucy: I've detected
a low-level signal distortion

18:39.995 --> 18:42.611
that's causing the elevator's
tether to vibrate,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.787
- So maybe we should find
the source of the distortion.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.955
Lucy: And by "we,"
I take it you mean "me"?

18:49.963 --> 18:52.500
- See that? Pretty soon we'll
be finishing each other's...

18:52.507 --> 18:53.872
Lucy: Work orders.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.135
- Eh.
Lucy: Did I get that wrong?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.092
- You'll get it next time, girl.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.052
- What's he doing here?

19:00.056 --> 19:02.638
- Everyone relax.
Alvis didn't do it.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.973
- Oh, we're supposed
to believe that?

19:03.977 --> 19:05.558
- Yes, we're Killjoys.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.722
We took an oath to be objective,

19:06.730 --> 19:08.015
to take no sides.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.684
- An oath that
went out the window

19:09.691 --> 19:11.773
when we denied
your request for money.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.152
- Cut the shit,
you spineless coward.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.158
- She's dead.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.823
- We were all standing
right here.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.788
What the hells
is going on, Dutch?

19:27.751 --> 19:29.332
One of us is hunting the Nine.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.458
- First a stomach gash.
Now a walking geyser of blood?

19:34.466 --> 19:35.922
- She's not walking anymore.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.256
- Well, that's probably
for the best.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.591
- Don't worry.
The day's young.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.961
- Well, it sounds internal.
It's probably biological.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.553
- For example?
- Well, as much as I'd love

19:42.557 --> 19:44.343
to play Guess the Pathogen,
I feel like there's

19:44.351 --> 19:47.639
something else
I had to do today. Owl

19:47.646 --> 19:49.056
Shit.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.474
Right, the elevator.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.393
If I don't fix it,
you're all toast.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.482
So if you'll excuse me, I have
to go find the control room,

19:54.486 --> 19:57.102
which I'm guessing is
a closet full of grass and spit.

19:57.113 --> 19:59.980
— l'll com Zeph.
- No.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.902
l'll com Zeph.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.526
- Or we could all com Zeph
together as a family.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.073
- What about Louella?
Does she have any idea

20:06.081 --> 20:07.946
who's behind this?
- All of them.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.993
They all have reasons to want
to kill each other, a lot.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.037
- Man, I hate
these dick-holes.

20:13.630 --> 20:16.838
Come on, give me something here.

20:18.176 --> 20:22.044
- Johnny, I'm...

20:22.055 --> 20:24.512
I'm not feeling very well.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.474
- Louella.
No, no.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.016
- A stabbing with no knife?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.934
- We need you
to help solve this.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.978
- Sorry, I can't solve this
without doing some tests,

20:35.985 --> 20:37.111
or at least seeing the wound.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.103
I'm totally blind here, Dutch.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.526
Speaking of tests, did D'av
tell you about the brains?

20:41.533 --> 20:43.990
- Zeph, focus.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.200
Tell me what test you need
to do, and I'll do it.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.991
I'll be your eyes.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.410
- You ever done
an autopsy, Dutch?

21:10.687 --> 21:12.848
- Get your
sticky fingers off me!

21:15.150 --> 21:17.516
What is going on here?

21:17.527 --> 21:19.188
Where is Aneela?
- Having a bath.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.523
- Really, Gander,
if you wanted to watch,

21:24.534 --> 21:26.650
you should have just asked.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.993
-Although I'm not surprised
you don't know what's going on,

21:28.997 --> 21:30.703
I do enjoy your interpretation.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.164
- Whatever this is,
when Aneela finds out about it,

21:33.168 --> 21:34.704
she's going to...
- She's gonna what, Kendry?

21:34.711 --> 21:36.747
Look around you.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.996
Do you still think Aneela
is in control?

21:42.177 --> 21:44.338
You're a smart woman.
Try to act like it.

21:44.345 --> 21:48.008
- This isn't her ship.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.631
It's her prison.

21:49.642 --> 21:53.055
-Ah, now you're getting it.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.223
- You control Aneela while
you pretend to obey her. Why?

21:55.231 --> 21:59.019
- We don't control her.
We watch her.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.018
We learn from her.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.769
- We? We who?

22:02.781 --> 22:04.567
- The Hullen have existed
for thousands of years

22:04.574 --> 22:06.314
and across species.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.159
Did you really think the power
structure ended with Aneela?

22:09.162 --> 22:11.198
You see, Aneela's
abilities with the green

22:11.206 --> 22:12.696
are unlike anyone else's.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.198
It's the reason we've been
so patient with her.

22:15.210 --> 22:18.702
Then the RACs exploded.
Bit of a last straw, that.

22:18.713 --> 22:21.750
But thanks to Aneela's
recent scientific breakthrough,

22:21.758 --> 22:23.749
we may not need her anymore.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.002
And that's where you come in.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.130
Take her to treatment.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.382
- What treatment?
What is this?

22:32.393 --> 22:35.226
- Hopefully, the future.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.597
Or your good-bye.
I'm good with either.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.144
- No.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.187
She'll destroy you for this!

22:42.195 --> 22:44.811
Get off me!

22:44.823 --> 22:46.654
- Aneela will be furious

22:46.658 --> 22:48.148
if she finds out
what you're doing.

22:48.159 --> 22:50.275
- Oh, don't be
so dramatic, Brynn.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.368
Aneela will pout
about her missing pet

22:52.372 --> 22:54.363
until we find her another.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.660
Nothing special about this one.

22:58.253 --> 23:00.118
- Walk me through it.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.710
- Dutch, I've seen what
you can do with a blade

23:01.714 --> 23:03.250
to people who are alive.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.839
This should be
a walk in the park.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.755
- There's just been
a lot of dying lately.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.673
I can't seem
to get away from it.

23:09.681 --> 23:12.263
- Right. Sorry.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.723
Take your time.

23:25.697 --> 23:28.404
- Okay.
I'm ready.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.273
- Okay, first make
a vertical incision

23:30.285 --> 23:32.992
in the lower abdomen.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.877
- In.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.746
- Now, free the intestines

23:44.757 --> 23:46.713
by cutting the mesentery tissue,

23:46.718 --> 23:48.379
the gross foldy thing
on the abdominal wall.

23:48.386 --> 23:52.129
- There are no intestines.
It's just a bloody mess.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.846
It's like a bomb
went off in here.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.136
- Look, I don't want
to tell you how to do yourjob,

23:56.144 --> 23:57.884
though technically it's my job,
but it's impossible

23:57.896 --> 24:00.137
for there to be
no intestinal structures.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.309
-And I'm telling you,
it's soup.

24:02.317 --> 24:05.684
- Dig deeper.
Just move stuff around.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.280
- What the hells?

24:14.287 --> 24:16.243
- Dutch?
What is it?

24:18.458 --> 24:20.824
-Ah, it cut me!

24:20.835 --> 24:23.702
- You're freaking me out.
What's wrong? Dutch?

24:23.713 --> 24:25.328
- Nobody move!
- Liar!

24:25.340 --> 24:26.329
- Dutch, what's going on?

24:26.341 --> 24:28.047
l have no bloody idea.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.990
Hello?

25:20.770 --> 25:22.351
Papa.
- Hello, Aneela.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.937
- You're still here.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.027
- It's happening to me too,
isn't it?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.896
Whatever's happening to them.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.991
- No, because I am not gonna
watch another Simms die.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.954
- Was she scared?

25:44.168 --> 25:47.410
- Yes.
She was.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.959
And I couldn't do
a goddamn thing about it.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.884
| shoulda come and talked
to you afterwards.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.880
- No, I wouldn't have listened.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.847
l was in too much pain.

26:05.023 --> 26:08.356
- Surgeons did nice work though.
- Please, don't.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.317
It makes me think of that day.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.982
You know what's good
about funerals, Johnny?

26:16.034 --> 26:19.151
They let you move forward.

26:19.162 --> 26:21.118
And ljust want
to move forward, okay?

26:21.122 --> 26:23.909
Put Pawter's loss behind us.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.253
- Okay.

26:33.051 --> 26:35.918
Stop smiling
long enough to sing.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.465
- Then the bad times came.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.304
- Yes, then the bad times came.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.924
- But the girl had a plan.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.891
That's all right.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.887
Now the girl had...

26:46.898 --> 26:49.480
She was a queen.

26:49.484 --> 26:51.065
She knew what she had to do.

26:51.069 --> 26:54.106
She made her land very small.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.444
Till the whole world...

26:55.448 --> 26:57.905
- Could fit in the palm
of her hand.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.490
-And she swallowed it whole,

26:59.494 --> 27:02.406
so that no more harm
could come to her people.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.496
- I did it, Papa.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.365
I found the way
to save everyone.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.332
- No!

27:09.337 --> 27:11.953
No!

27:14.342 --> 27:18.301
- Go on then.
Tell me a story.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.888
- This is ridiculous.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.053
- I'm telling you, it flew
out of her damn body.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.347
- Do you think we're idiots?
- I know I do.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.141
- Don't think you're
getting away with this, monk.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.389
You may have fooled them,
but you're not fooling me.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.140
- The fact that you're alive
is proof that I'm innocent,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.143
'cause I would have
killed you first.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.985
- I can't take this.
I gotta get out.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.116
- It's all right.
Just take it easy.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.402
- I can feel them.
They're on my skin.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.990
Crawling.
They're everywhere.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.120
I can hear them buzzing.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.236
- I know you're scared but...

27:44.247 --> 27:46.408
- Dutch, I can hear it, too.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.280
Listen.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.907
- What the holy shit is that?

28:05.935 --> 28:07.425
- What, are you gonna shoot her?

28:07.436 --> 28:09.142
- Well, she's already dead.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.150
- Move!
- What is that?

28:17.155 --> 28:19.897
- Dear God! Catch it!
- Kill it!

28:21.325 --> 28:24.988
- Got you, you piece of...

28:24.996 --> 28:26.907
robo-shit?

28:29.333 --> 28:31.995
- Johnny, I'm sending
you something.

28:32.003 --> 28:33.539
This is what's killing the Nine.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.457
See what you can dig up.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.455
- Melek didn't have a stab
wound, she had an exit wound.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.502
- How did those things
get inside them?

28:39.510 --> 28:41.466
- Maybe it's something they ate.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.212
- The Nine don't do anything
together, let alone break bread.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.600
- The seeds.
From the ceremony.

28:46.601 --> 28:49.968
They both ate the seeds.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.015
- We all ate the seeds.

28:57.195 --> 28:59.060
- Luce, I'm gonna
need you to put a pin

28:59.071 --> 29:00.572
in the distortion search
and run this moth-bot

29:00.573 --> 29:02.985
through the RAC's
weapons database.

29:02.992 --> 29:05.199
Lucy: There are no matches
in the RAC weapons database.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.989
- What?
How is that even possible?

29:06.996 --> 29:08.202
Lucy: Perhaps
it wasn't intended

29:08.206 --> 29:09.992
to be used as a weapon.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.489
- Well, what was it
intended for, crafts?

29:11.500 --> 29:13.491
Lucy: Shall I brainstorm
alternative uses?

29:13.502 --> 29:15.493
- Just try running it through
the general pattern database.

29:15.504 --> 29:19.042
Lucy: Match found.
Simms, Adaline.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.006
- Pawter's mother.
But...

29:37.318 --> 29:39.479
LoueHa.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.694
- My mother designed those seeds
to dig deep into the earth

29:41.697 --> 29:43.312
and irrigate the soil.

29:43.324 --> 29:45.280
She never got to use them.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.525
- Oh, I'm sure that
she would be thrilled.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.572
Way to upcycle.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.196
Where did you hide
the frequency jammer?

29:52.208 --> 29:54.290
That stopped the elevator.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.410
Your prosthetic arm.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.002
I'd say I'm impressed,

29:59.006 --> 30:01.497
but I try not to compliment
mass murderers.

30:01.509 --> 30:04.546
- This isn't a murder.
It's an execution.

30:04.553 --> 30:08.011
My parents stood up to the Nine,
and they were killed for it.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.630
Pawter, too.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.758
- This is not the way to deal
with your loss, Louella.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.680
- And how do you know?

30:13.688 --> 30:17.556
When Pawter died,
you ran like a coward.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.602
Now the Nine are running.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.647
But I have nowhere to go because
they took everything from me.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.321
If it wasn't for you,
Pawter would never

30:29.328 --> 30:32.536
have got caught up
in the mess she did.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.701
She'd be alive.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.325
- Please tell me the trigger's
not in the beads.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.507
Yeah, oh, yeah.
It's in the beads.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.796
- I could kill you
in an instant.

30:46.804 --> 30:49.045
That's just a taste.

30:49.056 --> 30:52.344
Lucy: John, I'm detecting
a foreign body in your abdomen.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.387
- You too, huh?

30:54.395 --> 30:56.477
Keep an eye on it for me, okay?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.391
- It's attached
to your stomach lining.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.685
It's not going anywhere.

31:00.693 --> 31:04.402
- Pawter dedicated her life
to helping people.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.316
She wouldn't want this.
You know that.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.736
- What I know
died with my family.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.449
Everything else
is a blank slate.

31:10.453 --> 31:12.409
- Deactivate the seeds.
It's not too late.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.620
- The pain you're
starting to feel

31:15.624 --> 31:18.081
is the seed beginning to open.

31:18.085 --> 31:20.076
These won't be quick
like the others.

31:20.087 --> 31:22.339
Now that all the seeds
have been activated,

31:22.340 --> 31:25.503
you'll all die slowly
with a hole in your stomachs.

31:25.509 --> 31:29.468
Like my sister.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.508
Are you scared, John?

31:34.268 --> 31:36.429
- Louella, they will
know it's you.

31:36.437 --> 31:39.474
You're not gonna
get away with this.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.768
- I didn't do this
to get away with it.

31:41.776 --> 31:44.358
I did it to get even.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.779
Luce, what's my status?

31:49.784 --> 31:52.651
Lucy: Early stage granuloma.
- Well, maybe you could...

31:52.661 --> 31:54.572
Lucy: Say that in English?

31:54.580 --> 31:56.366
Your stomach is inflaming
in an attempt to...

31:56.374 --> 31:58.114
- Wall off the seed.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.867
Lucy: John, we finished
each other's sentence.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.790
- I told you we would.

32:03.798 --> 32:06.460
How are the others?
- We're shit, John.

32:06.467 --> 32:08.128
- It's Louella.
She's using her prayer beads

32:08.135 --> 32:09.796
to activate the seeds.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.419
That's why she stopped the
elevator, to keep it in range.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.466
- John, you have to stop her.

32:13.474 --> 32:14.714
- First, you gotta get
the elevator out of range

32:14.725 --> 32:16.340
to deactivate the seeds.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.467
- How the hells do we do that?

32:17.478 --> 32:19.469
We're still stuck here.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.345
- Not if you release
the emergency lever.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.143
The gravitational pull
of the loading dock

32:23.150 --> 32:25.436
should pull you out of range.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.729
- Yeah, and crash to our death.
- Not necessarily.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.568
- Well, that's comforting.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.403
- Lucy, a little help.

32:30.408 --> 32:32.148
Lucy: The density
of the loading dock

32:32.159 --> 32:34.366
gives it three times the
gravitational force of the sun,

32:34.370 --> 32:36.486
which will get you
out of range in 10.2 seconds.

32:36.497 --> 32:38.533
- Now give 'em the bad news.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.452
Lucy: The elevator will crash
into the loading dock

32:40.459 --> 32:41.835
in 20 seconds,

32:41.836 --> 32:43.576
leaving less than ten seconds

32:43.587 --> 32:45.418
to re-engage the clamp.

32:45.423 --> 32:47.163
- See, there's always bad news.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.755
-Alvis, get everyone
strapped in.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.340
Lucy, count us down until
we're all clear, yeah?

32:50.344 --> 32:51.629
Lucy: I wouldn't miss it.

32:51.637 --> 32:52.843
- No, John, wait,
what about you?

32:52.847 --> 32:55.589
- I'll be fine.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.602
See, I'm finally starting
to figure this place out.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.345
- There has to be
another option.

33:03.357 --> 33:04.858
Let's just take a second
and think about this.

33:04.859 --> 33:06.724
- Dutch, do it.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.566
Alvis: Okay,
we're ready down here!

33:15.661 --> 33:18.198
— What the hells.
I can't move.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.911
- Three times the force
of gravity, remember?

33:19.915 --> 33:21.655
- Yeah, that definitely
rings a bell. Now what?

33:21.667 --> 33:23.373
- On it.
Lucy: Commencing countdown

33:23.377 --> 33:24.913
to re-engage clamp.
Good luck.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.876
Ten...

33:26.881 --> 33:29.497
- Ow!
Was that on purpose?

33:29.508 --> 33:31.214
- Probably.
Lucy: Seven, six...

33:31.218 --> 33:33.425
- Ahh!
Come on!

33:33.429 --> 33:35.215
- That's not your shooting hand.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.429
- Well, it is now.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.970
Lucy: Three... two... one.

33:39.977 --> 33:44.391
- J‘ Elevator.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.639
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on, guys.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.608
Please.

33:49.612 --> 33:51.523
- Dutch.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.486
Dutch, are you okay?

33:53.491 --> 33:54.981
- Yeah. Are you?
- I'm okay.

33:54.992 --> 33:56.778
Everybody okay down there?

33:56.785 --> 33:58.571
- Yeah, we made it.
- We're alive.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.615
- John.
- Praise the trees.

34:00.623 --> 34:01.612
- Johnny.

34:01.624 --> 34:03.910
Johnny, you there?

34:03.918 --> 34:06.705
- There's something about
Jaqobis that fights the green,

34:06.712 --> 34:08.919
breaks through.

34:08.923 --> 34:10.538
It's finally what I needed to...

34:10.549 --> 34:13.791
- Aneela?
Commander?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.713
- Please, go on.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.881
Tell me more.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.754
- Did you hear that?

34:18.766 --> 34:20.597
Was that in the green?

34:20.601 --> 34:22.262
- Echoes.

34:22.269 --> 34:23.930
Old memories.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.475
- Commander, please,
you have to stop him...

34:26.482 --> 34:29.940
- I've been wandering around
your memories in here.

34:29.944 --> 34:31.775
Some of them are missing.

34:31.779 --> 34:33.610
Think back.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.570
Why is that?

34:39.036 --> 34:41.743
- You know why.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.578
- Oops.

34:43.582 --> 34:44.867
- You're not Khlyen.
- Aneela...

34:44.875 --> 34:46.581
- I know who you are.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.621
- Hmm.
Does it really matter?

34:48.629 --> 34:51.291
Stay with me.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.414
You're all alone
out there anyway.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.918
- I'm not alone.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.636
Not anymore.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.720
- Commander, Aneela, wake up.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.466
You have to wake up!

35:03.477 --> 35:05.593
Commander, you have to wake up.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.980
He's doing something
to the Qreshi woman.

35:06.981 --> 35:09.688
- Such disappointment, Brynn.

35:09.692 --> 35:11.478
- You're on the wrong side
of this, Gander.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.773
- And we had
such big plans for you.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.988
- Commander, please, wake up.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.948
They're taking Kendry.

35:27.084 --> 35:28.790
- Die.

35:36.885 --> 35:41.720
Where is Kendry?

35:46.020 --> 35:49.262
You don't know
what you're doing.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.980
— Whatever you found
in that lab,

35:59.992 --> 36:02.654
that's why he took her.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.038
- Where is Kendry?

36:05.039 --> 36:06.654
- I don't know.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.872
They just dragged her away.

36:11.629 --> 36:16.999
- Where... is... she?

36:33.233 --> 36:34.188
- You're the coward.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.062
That's why you left
before the job was done.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.064
| get it.

36:41.075 --> 36:43.566
I did the exact same thing.

36:43.577 --> 36:45.738
I killed for love.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.202
l was a murderer.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.697
- Don't call me that.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.573
- It's okay.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.576
You'll get used to it.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.088
Eventually even
start to like it.

36:55.089 --> 36:58.547
It makes you feel strong.
Till it doesn't.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.586
Till it taints every memory
you have of her.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.095
- You're not gonna trick me

37:02.096 --> 37:03.757
into feeling bad
about this, Johnny.

37:03.764 --> 37:06.506
- I won't have to.
These aren't deaths, Louella.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.599
They're murders.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.594
And once the satisfaction
of revenge wears off,

37:11.605 --> 37:13.596
you'll be right back
where you started,

37:13.607 --> 37:15.347
but this time you'll
have blood on your hands.

37:20.614 --> 37:23.526
The elevator,

37:23.534 --> 37:26.571
now that was smart.

37:26.578 --> 37:30.241
Killing people from a distance,
that's the way to go.

37:30.249 --> 37:33.366
But if you want to kill me,

37:33.377 --> 37:35.789
you're gonna have to watch,
and I don't think that you can.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.752
- No?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.750
And what makes you so special?

37:44.805 --> 37:47.046
- Because I loved your sister.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.099
And she loved me.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.228
God.

38:05.826 --> 38:09.284
Oh, God.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.654
Lucy, what's the damage?

38:11.665 --> 38:13.371
Lucy: Minimal.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.661
Dutch and your brother
are on their way.

38:15.669 --> 38:19.207
You're very lucky, John.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.170
- Yeah, right.

38:29.683 --> 38:31.389
- You know, we could
have had a drink on my ship,

38:31.393 --> 38:34.351
or your ship,
or anywhere but here.

38:34.354 --> 38:38.688
- Nah, it's good for the Nine
to be among the people.

38:38.692 --> 38:42.435
You know, being the guardians
of the Quad and all that, right?

38:42.446 --> 38:44.357
- Well, this was fun,
but I hate it here.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.320
- I figured it out.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.862
- Congratulations
on whatever "it" is.

38:48.869 --> 38:51.781
Now take your hand off me.

38:51.789 --> 38:53.370
- So you can run away?

38:53.373 --> 38:56.285
'Cause that's the idea, right?

38:56.293 --> 38:59.456
The Nine starting fresh in
some remote corner of the J,

38:59.463 --> 39:01.829
like your ancestors planned.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.831
That's why you don't give a shit

39:03.842 --> 39:05.457
about the Hullen returning.

39:05.469 --> 39:07.300
'Cause you don't plan
to be here when they do.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.295
- You don't understand.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.422
- And that's why you tried
buying a Tolerance

39:11.433 --> 39:13.344
from the Scarbacks.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.810
So you can abandon the Quad
with a clear conscience.

39:16.814 --> 39:19.430
- Okay, you do understand.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.648
- You're right about
one thing, Kalla.

39:21.652 --> 39:24.234
Your ancestors
had no good choices.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.774
But you do.

39:25.781 --> 39:28.944
This time the choice is me.

39:28.951 --> 39:31.738
The choice is hope.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.952
- Yeah, no, we're still leaving.

39:33.956 --> 39:35.742
- Okay, what about this then?

39:35.749 --> 39:37.865
If we don't stop the Hullen,

39:37.876 --> 39:39.377
then you'll have nowhere to go,

39:39.378 --> 39:41.835
because soon
they'll be everywhere.

39:41.839 --> 39:44.376
Fund our war,

39:44.383 --> 39:46.874
and we still have a chance.

39:46.885 --> 39:50.753
Leave and you're
as good as dead.

39:50.764 --> 39:53.255
'Cause if the Hullen
don't find you,

39:53.267 --> 39:54.882
|wi||.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.767
Get outta here.

40:01.775 --> 40:04.391
We've got a wake to throw.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.279
- Hey.

40:10.284 --> 40:12.821
— To the end of pain
and all that festers,

40:12.828 --> 40:15.865
to unlimited hokk
and premium sexers.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.908
- I'll take that drink now.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.910
- Bar's closed.

40:25.299 --> 40:28.291
- Can we talk about this morning
like normal human adults?

40:31.430 --> 40:36.345
Okay, like pretend human adults?

40:36.351 --> 40:38.728
- Fine.

40:38.729 --> 40:40.435
Not here.
Outside.

40:40.439 --> 40:43.306
- Great.
I'll get some hooch.

40:43.317 --> 40:45.273
- Make it a bottle.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.575
- Dutch. Finally.

41:06.298 --> 41:07.913
- Yeah, well, it's about to be
because I just figured out

41:07.925 --> 41:10.337
what Khlyen was protecting
in the Remnant.

41:10.344 --> 41:12.335
- You did?

41:12.346 --> 41:14.428
- Brains.
Mircoslices of neocortex.

41:14.431 --> 41:16.012
It's where memories are stored.

41:16.016 --> 41:17.347
- What?

41:17.351 --> 41:18.932
Whose brains?
And gross.

41:18.936 --> 41:21.427
- Well, the sample DNA
is corrupted as feck,

41:21.438 --> 41:24.805
but from what I can tell
it's a close match to, uh...

41:24.816 --> 41:26.067
you.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.808
- How's that even possible?

41:27.819 --> 41:29.810
- Right now all I know for sure

41:29.821 --> 41:32.528
is that these cells have
memories that Khlyen was hiding.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.488
Want to crack them open
and see what's inside?

41:34.493 --> 41:36.859
- Yes.
Let's go.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.906
- Shouldn't we wait for...
- I said let's go.

41:38.914 --> 41:40.870
- Okay.

41:45.379 --> 41:48.542
- Dutch?

41:48.548 --> 41:50.709
Dutch?

41:56.056 --> 41:58.388
- I'm not mad at Louella.

41:58.392 --> 42:00.428
I understand wanting vengeance
as much as anyone.

42:02.896 --> 42:04.932
- But?

42:08.068 --> 42:10.901
- I don't know.

42:10.904 --> 42:13.486
I still want to punish
Delle Seyah, but...

42:13.490 --> 42:16.948
- J‘ Pulsing my senses...

42:16.952 --> 42:21.821
- The only true vengeance would
be for her to feel my pain.

42:21.832 --> 42:23.914
- J‘ l was hunting

42:23.917 --> 42:28.411
I Now I'm running.

42:28.422 --> 42:30.504
- But she will never love,

42:30.507 --> 42:32.919
or be loved by anyone enough
for that to happen.

42:38.098 --> 42:43.638
- J‘ There is no other way

42:43.645 --> 42:48.639
J“ Pulsing my senses awake

42:51.945 --> 42:55.108
J‘ l was hunting,
now I'm running J‘

42:59.119 --> 43:03.078
J“ Now time has run its course I
