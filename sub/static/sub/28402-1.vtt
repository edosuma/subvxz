Hey!

02:51.893 --> 02:54.429
Help me! Help me!

03:32.643 --> 03:35.926
My nightmares are getting
stronger and stronger.

03:36.893 --> 03:40.258
Characters from famous paintings
continue to attack me.

03:40.726 --> 03:43.843
This time, it was
Velázquez's Infanta Margarita,

03:44.101 --> 03:46.140
and Frank Duveneck's Whistling Boy.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.928
I haven't had a good night's
sleep in three weeks now.

03:49.143 --> 03:52.259
<i>We'll have low temperatures
of 20 degrees and highs near 27.</i>

<i>Witnesses reported that a young

04:15.226 --> 04:19.053
<i>and speeding off in a red Mercedes in the

04:43.059 --> 04:44.138
Bonjour, Madame!

04:44.684 --> 04:45.763
Mademoiselle!

04:46.184 --> 04:50.510
Well, Mademoiselle... you didn't come
to Paris to steal that fan, did you?

04:51.101 --> 04:55.641
Non, détective Kowalski. I just
wanted to give you something to do.

05:24.893 --> 05:29.468
Oh, Margaret,
this city is just so romantic!

05:29.601 --> 05:30.976
Oh, George!

05:31.101 --> 05:34.515
I wish we could stay in Paris forever.

05:34.643 --> 05:37.215
How about another bottle of wine?

05:38.601 --> 05:40.307
Waiter, please!

06:05.809 --> 06:06.805
Impressive.

06:30.101 --> 06:33.052
Mom, I'm old enough, I can
take care of myself...

09:48.476 --> 09:52.055
Mademoiselle! You were sent
to steal the Regent Diamond!

09:52.268 --> 09:54.093
Not bad for a Frenchman.

09:54.476 --> 09:55.756
I'm not French.

09:56.184 --> 09:57.429
Obviously.

09:57.559 --> 09:59.135
Why the fan?

09:59.268 --> 10:02.219
Because beauty shouldn't be locked away.

10:03.601 --> 10:05.841
Some beauties must be locked away.

10:05.976 --> 10:09.390
Well, then choose wisely, mon chéri!

10:09.518 --> 10:11.426
No, no, no, no, no...! Don't...!

10:12.351 --> 10:13.347

Polyart Clinic! May I help you?

10:42.851 --> 10:47.224
Good afternoon, this is Mimi.
Could I speak to Dr. Brandt?

10:47.351 --> 10:48.678
<i>Mimi who?</i>

10:48.809 --> 10:50.054
Just Mimi.

10:51.434 --> 10:52.382
Hello?

10:52.518 --> 10:53.430
Yes?

10:53.559 --> 10:55.266
I'll be straightforward, Doctor.

10:55.393 --> 10:58.427
I have a problem that's
getting in the way of my work.

10:59.101 --> 11:01.175
<i>Narcolepsy? Tourettle's? ADHD?</i>

11:02.684 --> 11:03.550
Kleptomania.

11:03.684 --> 11:07.180
Aha. So you're stealing
from your employer.

11:07.559 --> 11:08.674
Not quite.

12:38.643 --> 12:40.930
So, hanging around wasn't an option.

12:41.059 --> 12:41.972
<i>Are you sure?</i>

12:42.101 --> 12:43.097
Absolutely.

12:57.684 --> 12:59.178
Oh, great...

13:00.059 --> 13:01.304
Hi, sweetie!

13:01.601 --> 13:04.351
Cut the crap, huh?!
Where is my diamond?

13:04.726 --> 13:07.132
Last time I checked, it was in the Louvre.

13:07.309 --> 13:12.180
Well, the last time I checked, I
was paying you cash for it, huh?

13:12.601 --> 13:13.798
Something came up.

13:13.934 --> 13:21.306
<i>A fan?</i> Haha, Mimi... I would not
want to be in your shoes right now.

13:28.518 --> 13:31.552
So, you see, I have to get
better, and quick.

13:32.143 --> 13:36.054
I read in a magazine that you're
the best shrink to treat artistic souls.

13:36.518 --> 13:38.508
I don't know about the best.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.930
<i>Well, it wasn't a very good magazine.</i>

13:41.059 --> 13:42.968
<i>Thanks for the vote of confidence.</i>

13:46.893 --> 13:48.268
<i>Hello ? You there ?</i>

13:49.184 --> 13:52.550
Yeah, Doc. I'll see you soon.

14:42.101 --> 14:44.969
I don't wanna be Little Red
Riding Hood!

14:45.101 --> 14:49.095
Come on! It's only a therapy. Yesterday
I was Little Red Riding Hood...

14:49.226 --> 14:50.767
Thank you, Fernando!

14:50.893 --> 14:55.764
Bye-Bye Joe, you are here because you
can't keep quiet in delicate situations.

14:56.768 --> 14:59.719
Playing this role is exactly what you need.

15:00.726 --> 15:05.515
Huh. Okay, Doc. I'll do it.

15:05.643 --> 15:09.720
So, Bye-Bye Joe, you will be
Little Red Riding Hood.

15:09.851 --> 15:14.640
Membrano Bruno, you will be the thunder,
the wind and the wolf.

15:14.768 --> 15:19.841
Fernando, you will
be the bells, Granny and Luke, the hunter.

15:20.309 --> 15:24.303
Okay, now you know your roles,
so let's start! We can hear Little Red

15:24.434 --> 15:30.680
Riding Hood walking through the
forest: squish-squish-squish!

15:30.809 --> 15:34.342
Aha... Squish-squish-squish!

15:34.476 --> 15:38.932
Excellent.
Places everyone - and let's start!

15:39.768 --> 15:44.390
A dark and stormy night.
A terrible wind roars.

15:49.226 --> 15:52.307
The bells of the nearby church ring...

15:55.143 --> 15:59.303
Little Red Riding Hood is walking
through the forest...

16:02.976 --> 16:06.472
Somewhere in the distance
a wolf howls.

16:10.059 --> 16:14.516
While in a cottage at the edge of
the forest, Granny is asleep...

16:18.059 --> 16:22.136
The same forest is also home to
Luke, the hunter...

16:27.976 --> 16:30.975
Thunder rumbles powerfully
nearby...

17:26.726 --> 17:29.393
Good evening, Mr. Barutanski!

17:30.101 --> 17:31.132
Hi, Mortimer!

17:58.684 --> 17:59.716
Four Kalashnikovs!

17:59.934 --> 18:03.467
<i>...Mike Kowalski, a private detective
from Washington DC., managed to save the</i>

18:03.601 --> 18:07.180
<i>priceless fan by leaping into the river
Seine, where the thief had thrown it.</i>

18:07.476 --> 18:10.676
<i>At the news conference, the Managing
Director of the Louvre Museum...</i>

18:10.934 --> 18:14.051
I know that guy! Kowalski... Huh...

18:14.893 --> 18:15.924
Is he one of yours?

18:16.268 --> 18:20.179
Nah, his father, Gerhard,
used to work for the Company.

18:20.309 --> 18:23.474
We worked on
Subliminal Programming together,

18:23.601 --> 18:27.548
which focused on experiments
with 16 mm film.

18:27.684 --> 18:33.599
That was one hell of a project... a good
old fashioned rivalry with the Russians.

18:47.351 --> 18:50.385
Hey, wait a second!

18:52.809 --> 18:59.423
I knew it! That's exactly the same
forward jump with a backward somersault.

19:01.393 --> 19:07.307
Hockey, I ran across an interesting girl.
I have to get to know her.

19:14.643 --> 19:17.179
No way, can't be her...

19:19.809 --> 19:23.803
But there's got to be...

19:23.934 --> 19:25.345
Bingo!

19:25.476 --> 19:29.885
Stunt double, Mimi. So, your name is Mimi.

19:30.768 --> 19:33.600
Are you a member of the
Stuntmen's Association?

19:34.184 --> 19:37.384
It's no good, Hockey.
Mimi isn't a joiner.

19:43.226 --> 19:44.222
Yes?

19:45.059 --> 19:46.340
<i>The same shirt again!</i>

19:46.476 --> 19:47.591
Mom!

19:47.726 --> 19:50.511
<i>Is it my fault?
Did I raise you this way?</i>

19:50.643 --> 19:54.139
<i>International broadcast,
same shirt as in November!</i>

19:54.268 --> 19:56.934
- You have the memory of an elephant.
- <i>Don't humour me, young man!</i>

19:57.059 --> 20:01.717
Hey Mom, you want humour? Father's day
is coming up. Care to tell me something?

20:01.976 --> 20:04.382
<i>No. What are you getting at?</i>

20:04.601 --> 20:05.928
My father's identity?

20:06.059 --> 20:08.466
<i>Not again! We have already
discussed this, I don't want to go...</i>

20:08.601 --> 20:11.884
We haven't discussed anything,
you just keep silent!

20:12.018 --> 20:13.345
Who was he, Rasputin?

20:13.851 --> 20:14.966
<i>No. It's not funny!</i>

20:15.101 --> 20:17.507
One suspect is out. 4 billion remain.

20:18.059 --> 20:23.263
<i>Mike, this issue is closed as far as I'm
concerned. Sorry for pestering you, but...</i>

20:23.393 --> 20:24.389
That's okay, mom.

20:27.059 --> 20:32.926
<i>Alright, son. I will talk to you tomorrow.
Take care!</i>

20:35.184 --> 20:36.642
Will do, mom.

20:59.268 --> 21:02.349
It was his fault, Hockey.
He drew first blood.

21:19.893 --> 21:21.931
Not a very good forgery.

21:22.059 --> 21:24.631
Hey! I'm not a forgery!

21:24.768 --> 21:27.434
What are you then, darling?

21:37.059 --> 21:38.802
I'm the real thing, baby!

21:39.143 --> 21:40.139
Bye-Bye Joe!

21:40.268 --> 21:43.882
I know, I know. Statues don't speak.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.306
Impressive, Doctor.

21:47.059 --> 21:50.508
Art is the key to
the troubles of the mind.

21:51.059 --> 21:54.141
Membrano Bruno is two-dimensional,
but he eats too much,

21:54.268 --> 21:57.267
which is getting in the way
of his banking business.

22:01.101 --> 22:02.595
Too many sausages!

22:02.893 --> 22:04.848
Too many sausages...

22:05.226 --> 22:09.350
He's trying to carve his craving
for food into stone to contain it.

22:09.809 --> 22:12.132
"Possess your problems to conquer them.”

22:12.518 --> 22:14.058
Hm, exactly!

22:14.184 --> 22:15.678
I read it in a magazine.

22:16.809 --> 22:19.926
Fernando is dealing
with his particular obsession

22:20.059 --> 22:22.927
by creating variations
on a three-note melody.

22:23.059 --> 22:24.719
What's his obsession?

22:24.851 --> 22:28.679
The signature he leaves after
each successful security breach.

22:41.476 --> 22:45.553
So, what about me, Doc? Ventriloquism?

22:46.809 --> 22:49.891
Your compulsion to steal comes
from a deeper need.

22:50.018 --> 22:52.506
You are missing something in your life.

22:53.684 --> 22:55.095
I want you to paint it.

22:55.476 --> 22:58.048
How can I paint it if I don't know
what it is?

22:58.476 --> 23:03.809
Trust in the brush.
It will reveal all.

23:06.309 --> 23:07.590
If you say so...

23:53.101 --> 23:56.182
Come closer, Ruben!

24:01.059 --> 24:03.513
Come closer!

24:20.184 --> 24:22.970
If I frightened you, forgive me!

24:23.101 --> 24:26.052
And come to Paris to see me sometime!

25:30.184 --> 25:33.052
I've been waiting for you, Ruben!

26:05.726 --> 26:12.683
Ruben, you said that everything started
after your father's funeral, a month ago.

26:20.184 --> 26:26.514
Body to the ground, earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, and dust to dust...

26:26.893 --> 26:28.090
I went back to his house.

26:32.643 --> 26:34.219
I hadn't been to his lab in years.

26:35.643 --> 26:38.926
All my childhood memories suddenly hit me.

26:45.768 --> 26:49.466
Daddy, can I go outside and play
with the snails?

26:49.601 --> 26:55.764
No, Ruben. Maybe later. This
time is our cartoon time.

26:56.476 --> 26:59.095
But Daddy, please!

27:00.059 --> 27:03.058
Ruben, men don't cry!

27:13.559 --> 27:17.720
It was Rusalocka.
My favourite cartoon.

27:17.851 --> 27:20.470
Ah, the Little Mermaid.

27:20.643 --> 27:25.431
But for some reason I couldn't watch it.
I felt anxious and I had to escape.

27:26.684 --> 27:28.308
Remember the Sea Witch?

27:28.434 --> 27:34.182
Do you think she has any connection
to your next visit to Botticelli's Venus?

27:35.851 --> 27:37.392
I don't want to talk about that.

27:37.518 --> 27:41.844
Ruben, look at me!
If you don't let me help you,

27:41.976 --> 27:46.882
you're going to kill yourself!
Or someone else...

27:54.393 --> 27:55.803
When I entered the room...

27:55.934 --> 27:58.305
she was already waiting for me...

29:17.559 --> 29:21.388
...and I bet Doc's voice recorder
belonged to Sigmund Freud!

29:24.559 --> 29:28.802
Get serious, guys!
Don't you want to help him?

29:28.934 --> 29:31.139
But what can we do about it?

29:31.351 --> 29:33.473
I feel like you already have a plan.

29:34.184 --> 29:38.806
Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.
And it involves all of you.

29:38.934 --> 29:42.218
But there's only one thing
that we're any good at.

29:42.976 --> 29:44.517
Exactly!

29:44.643 --> 29:48.175
Doc is a tipo simpatico.
But what's in it for us?

29:48.476 --> 29:51.013
Don't you want to know if
your therapy is working?

29:51.143 --> 29:52.719
Let's check it out!

30:04.518 --> 30:09.638
Guys, cameras and alarm system are prepped.

30:09.893 --> 30:12.381
Great stuff, Fernando, I'm impressed!

30:12.809 --> 30:16.970
Don't forget, Joe! Statues don't speak.

30:17.184 --> 30:19.472
Yeah, yeah, I got it, statues
don't speak, thanks...

30:21.184 --> 30:23.970
And your mother is normal?

30:24.101 --> 30:25.511
What do you mean “normal"?

30:25.643 --> 30:29.684
Well, I-I mean... is she three-dimensional?

30:29.934 --> 30:31.807
Yeah, she is three-dimensional.

30:32.559 --> 30:34.183
Two tickets, please!

30:35.434 --> 30:36.430
Two?

30:37.226 --> 30:38.222
Two.

30:38.643 --> 30:39.639
Okay, Sir.

30:40.643 --> 30:44.554
Your French is really good.
Is your mother French?

30:45.726 --> 30:47.966
I understand, yeah,
thanks, yeah, alright...

31:17.101 --> 31:21.178
Oh George, he doesn't really look
like he's thinking that hard.

31:21.393 --> 31:22.803
Nah...

31:22.934 --> 31:25.056
I reckon you look smarter than that.

31:25.476 --> 31:28.724
I look smarter than that when I
look in the mirror in the morning!

31:29.184 --> 31:35.347
I mean, he's all muscle, no brains...
so overrated, this statue!

31:36.351 --> 31:38.306
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

31:38.434 --> 31:41.053
Mmmm... All fat, no brains.

He is a one-dimensional guy.

What? He's... a dot?

32:30.184 --> 32:32.886

32:33.018 --> 32:36.052

<i>The museum has offered a 100
thousand euro reward</i>

33:15.143 --> 33:17.975
<i>for information leading to the
apprehension of the robbers.</i>

33:18.268 --> 33:19.548
Huh...

33:19.809 --> 33:23.638
A long time ago Gerhard told me
that Napoleon III the moment

33:23.768 --> 33:27.845
he saw the painting, personally
cut up Olympia with his sabre.

33:29.059 --> 33:31.927
But I'm sure he took care
not to harm the cat...

33:39.934 --> 33:40.764
Ciao, Mike!

33:40.893 --> 33:43.132
<i>Ciao, Marina!
What do you have for me?</i>

33:43.268 --> 33:45.342
Your mystery woman, Mimi...

33:45.476 --> 33:49.423
She worked for three years at the
Viareggio Circus in Roma. Acrobat,

33:49.851 --> 33:54.391
the best around. They kept her on,
even though she was a kleptomaniac.

33:55.059 --> 33:58.757
Kleptomaniac?
That's why she took the fan!

33:59.059 --> 34:00.968
<i>And she left a year ago.</i>

34:01.101 --> 34:03.175
To put her illness to better use.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.265
I'm sending you a copy of her
poster.

34:05.393 --> 34:07.680
<i>Thank you, Marina!
Great job.</i>

34:07.934 --> 34:10.341
I know. You owe me some serious dinner.

34:10.476 --> 34:11.851
<i>And dessert!</i>

34:13.768 --> 34:15.510
Such a ladies' man.

34:20.059 --> 34:24.136
So that's Mimi!

34:48.476 --> 34:51.889
And you went over last night's
security tapes, I presume?

34:52.768 --> 34:55.719
Oui, the cameras were frozen.

34:57.559 --> 35:02.466
Merci, Francois! I'd like to see
the archive tapes one month back!

35:24.518 --> 35:27.090
Whoa, what's he doing?

35:27.226 --> 35:30.391
Oh, he's bleeding.

35:30.643 --> 35:32.765
Hm... Performance at?

35:58.809 --> 36:00.682
Not now! I'm busy!

36:05.393 --> 36:06.554
Not now!

36:06.684 --> 36:10.631
Close your eyes, Doc!
We've got a surprise for you.

36:11.143 --> 36:11.641
Mimi...

36:11.768 --> 36:13.261
Please!

36:23.434 --> 36:26.883
Bye-Bye Joe, give me a hand!

36:52.643 --> 36:55.558
Wow, nice painting.

36:59.059 --> 37:03.136
See, Doc? Possess your
problems to conquer them.

37:37.851 --> 37:42.556
Good morning! One moment, please!

37:49.851 --> 37:50.432
I...

37:52.768 --> 37:54.510
Hoppla, we're alive!

39:59.768 --> 40:02.635
Oh, you are just in time, Ruben.

40:10.434 --> 40:15.056
Gun fight! Gun fight!

40:16.143 --> 40:21.974
Gun fight! Gun fight!

40:39.309 --> 40:42.059
What are you waiting for? Draw!

40:43.309 --> 40:46.059
Draw what?
I don't have a gun!

40:46.976 --> 40:49.678
Oh, but you do...

40:49.809 --> 40:50.722
...and not only one.

40:50.851 --> 40:51.515
But...

40:51.643 --> 40:54.393
Draw your guns!

40:54.518 --> 40:58.216
Gun fight! Gun fight!

41:15.143 --> 41:19.552
Wake up, wake up, Monsieur Brandt!
It seems like you have a nightmare!

41:23.059 --> 41:24.600
Where are we?

41:24.851 --> 41:26.759
In an airplane, Monsieur Brandt.

41:26.893 --> 41:30.223
We're flying to Arles.
That's where you've been sent.

41:37.601 --> 41:40.849
It's time! We are over Arles now.

41:45.559 --> 41:48.392
Hey! What are you doing?

41:48.809 --> 41:53.716
Don't be afraid, Monsieur Brandt!
You've been sent to my address!

41:57.143 --> 42:00.094
Are you crazy? Put me down!

42:00.226 --> 42:01.767
These are the rules!

42:01.893 --> 42:07.226
If the address is legible, the parcel
must be delivered, Monsieur Brandt.

42:08.643 --> 42:12.684
Noooo!

44:09.351 --> 44:13.724
What happened, Doc?
You look like a man who wants something.

44:13.851 --> 44:16.802
Van Gogh's Postman and Warhol's
Double Elvis.

44:16.934 --> 44:17.930
Both?

44:18.059 --> 44:18.972
No.

44:19.101 --> 44:22.846
I need all 13 paintings that are
tormenting me.

44:22.976 --> 44:24.433
If you're willing to help,

44:24.559 --> 44:27.843
we should all move to my villa
on the island of Biševo.

44:29.893 --> 44:34.219
It's in the Adriatic. The airport
in Rome isn't far away.

44:34.643 --> 44:37.973
Sure, Doc. Let's have a party!

45:47.059 --> 45:49.382
Peanut or le bonbon?

45:49.518 --> 45:50.549
Both, my dear.

45:59.434 --> 46:03.807
Sooner or later, everyone stops... smoking!

46:10.976 --> 46:12.884
Wow, nice body!

46:19.393 --> 46:22.641
Hey, look! I didn't know
Lenin was the Führer!

46:22.768 --> 46:24.972
I thought it was the other guy!

46:47.309 --> 46:52.050
... and he said: I don't wanna
be Little Red Riding Hood!

46:52.184 --> 46:56.641
<i>Our top story tonight:
the so-called Collector strikes again!</i>

46:57.059 --> 47:00.923
<i>After Paris, Budapest, Rio, Florence,
St. Petersburg and Sidney,</i>

47:01.059 --> 47:04.674
<i>the serial art robbers have hit
New York's Guggenheim Museum.</i>

47:04.809 --> 47:08.175
<i>At present, the estimated value
of stolen masterpieces</i>

47:08.309 --> 47:10.265
<i>has reached two billion dollars.</i>

47:10.393 --> 47:13.758
<i>The Chicago-based Union Cartel
Insurance Company has raised the</i>

47:13.893 --> 47:17.306
<i>reward for capturing the so-called
Collector to 20 million dollars.</i>

47:17.559 --> 47:22.265
Porca Miseria! 20 million! Hah.
For that kind of money,

47:22.393 --> 47:27.347
we have to screw around with drugs
and the police for two years!

47:27.476 --> 47:31.470
Ah well, it's my fault. I simply never
thought you could live off art.

47:31.934 --> 47:37.303
My grandpa used to say: Vincenzo,
stick to drugs and prostitution, you know,

47:37.684 --> 47:40.007
a man can make an honest living there.

47:40.143 --> 47:46.721
Ah-ah! No more!
We should enter this fucking field of art!

47:49.518 --> 47:53.465
<i>Domestic violence in Hollywood films made
between the 1930's and the mid-eighties</i>

47:53.601 --> 47:57.643
<i>was usually displayed as a show
of masculinity, or even romanticized.</i>

47:57.851 --> 48:00.257
<i>Well known examples
of such films are “My Baby Left</i>

48:00.393 --> 48:02.550
<i>Me," "Kiss Me Gently,"
"The Barber of Blitvia..."</i>

48:03.309 --> 48:08.133
Ah, we need more information.
Giuseppe, call Boris!

48:12.059 --> 48:19.929
Yes, of course Giuseppe. I'll do my best.
But you know my price...

48:21.268 --> 48:24.267
Come on, Doc!
You're exaggerating!

48:24.393 --> 48:29.299
No, Mimi. I'm serious.
You're getting closer every day!

48:29.434 --> 48:31.058
I feel it too!

48:33.101 --> 48:35.933
So, Doc, what's the next job?

48:36.059 --> 48:38.430
The Uffizi, Florence.

48:44.518 --> 48:48.511
<i>Breaking News! A few minutes after midnight,
thousands of tourists on the streets</i>

48:48.643 --> 48:53.549
<i>of Florence, Italy, noticed strange strobe
lights coming from the Uffizi Gallery.</i>

48:53.684 --> 48:56.766
<i>... made the police enter
the Uffizi Gallery</i>

48:56.893 --> 49:00.057
<i>immediately, only to discover the
empty frame of Botticelli's Venus.</i>

49:03.434 --> 49:06.718
Someone erased last night's
security footage from the Uffizi.

49:06.851 --> 49:09.850
However, I checked
through the archives...

49:09.976 --> 49:13.472
... and look! Remember the guy who
went crazy in front of Olympia?

49:13.601 --> 49:14.928
The performance artist?

49:15.059 --> 49:16.055
One and the same!

49:22.184 --> 49:24.093
Angelo, Diavolo! Sit!

49:26.476 --> 49:29.593
So, if you slow down
the strobe light from the Uffizi,

49:29.726 --> 49:31.800
it repeats a message in Morse code.

49:33.184 --> 49:36.052
Eye, eye, eye.

49:36.268 --> 49:39.516
Mhm... Like the three eyes
on the Musée d'Orsay!

51:07.476 --> 51:09.550
Here we go! Yeah!

51:12.518 --> 51:15.350
Whoa! Bloody hell!

51:16.601 --> 51:17.679
Doc...

51:18.893 --> 51:20.718
Who attacked you?

51:21.601 --> 51:23.592
The guy from Hopper's Nighthawks!

51:23.893 --> 51:26.760
Well, let's go to Chicago!

51:47.851 --> 51:50.719
Opa! Kowalski is already speaking!

51:57.476 --> 52:02.845
If we don't crack this case soon,
we'll never see those paintings again.

52:04.434 --> 52:06.674
Is this why we're paying you so much?

52:07.393 --> 52:09.266
With all due respect, Mr. Graham,

52:09.393 --> 52:13.340
we are dealing with a collector here,
and not a serial thief.

52:14.893 --> 52:20.048
He's taking paintings which couldn't be sold.
Not even on the black market.

52:20.393 --> 52:24.932
Mr. Kowalski, I've been in this business
for 45 years and I can tell you

52:25.059 --> 52:29.717
that in 6 months someone will put Olympia
up for sale in South Blitvia!

52:30.351 --> 52:34.475
No. Someone is building a collection.

52:34.768 --> 52:38.181
As a collector myself,
I understand how they think.

52:38.601 --> 52:43.093
Once the collection is complete,
he or she will stop.

52:43.559 --> 52:47.885
You follow your instincts and
we will follow our experience.

52:48.393 --> 52:51.889
We are raising the reward
to a 100 million dollars!

52:52.059 --> 52:56.516
Chort poberi! A 100 million!
I must call Vincenzo.

53:43.893 --> 53:46.927
Bye-Bye Joe, send it to Hotel Bellevue.

53:47.059 --> 53:47.723
Aha!

53:55.768 --> 53:59.382
Ruben, Kowalski recognised me,
you can't come to Rome with us!

54:32.184 --> 54:33.559
<i>Ciao Marina! Did you hear?</i>

54:33.684 --> 54:35.308
Yes, I did. Hopper!

54:35.434 --> 54:38.930
We can get the painting now!
Listen, tomorrow morning,

54:48.976 --> 54:51.382
She's connected. And she's not alone.

54:52.476 --> 54:56.600
Okay, Mike. I'll organize a welcome party!

55:03.476 --> 55:06.510
There are four of them.
The woman has the tube.

55:30.559 --> 55:31.555
Step back!

55:32.393 --> 55:34.182

<i>Lieutenant, let me see the painting!</i>

55:45.768 --> 55:49.217
<i>This is clearly the end of the
Collector's short-lived career.</i>

55:49.643 --> 55:52.807
Damn! What do we pay Boris for?

56:01.726 --> 56:05.933
<i>What an epic failure for the
Roman Police Department!</i>

56:06.059 --> 56:07.470
Boss, look!

56:08.184 --> 56:10.507
Porca puttana! That's Mimi!

56:10.643 --> 56:14.933
<i>Instead of reclaiming a famous painting,
they get a cat and mouse poster.</i>

56:15.351 --> 56:18.717
Alright, Mimi! 2:0 for you!

56:39.059 --> 56:40.719
Long time no see, Cooper.

56:41.434 --> 56:46.056
I needed some solitude.
Took my yearly trip to the mountains.

56:46.184 --> 56:49.432
Sometimes I wonder
why I come back at all.

56:50.059 --> 56:52.299
Haha. For the booze?

56:52.893 --> 56:55.216
Yeah. Reasonable assumption.

56:57.518 --> 56:58.975
<i>Who is the mysterious Collector?</i>

56:59.101 --> 57:01.969
<i>Let's review now the entire

57:02.101 --> 57:07.091

58:22.559 --> 58:23.674
Gotta hurry!

58:23.809 --> 58:29.178
Yeah, I overheard you! Come on!
Won't you help out an old friend?

58:29.309 --> 58:30.305
Acquaintance.

58:31.226 --> 58:35.303
Look, you don't want to do this alone, huh?

58:35.434 --> 58:39.381
We'll split the money. Fifty-fifty.
Just tell me who the Collector is!

58:39.518 --> 58:43.559
That's... It's not his fault.
I'd never betray my friends.

58:44.643 --> 58:45.840
Friends?

58:45.976 --> 58:48.382
Now, if you'll excuse me.

another name for me please?

01:01:57.268 --> 01:02:01.724
Gerhard Brandt, B - R - A - N - D - T,
former CIA Agent.

01:02:01.934 --> 01:02:03.345
<i>Just a second, Mike.</i>

01:02:13.393 --> 01:02:14.969
<i>Hello ? You there?</i>

01:02:15.101 --> 01:02:16.132
Of course!

01:02:16.268 --> 01:02:20.261
Okay, Gerhard Brandt,
born in Berlin, 1938, grew up

01:02:20.393 --> 01:02:24.884
in East Berlin. Former Stasi colonel,
expert in psychotechnics.

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:26.803
<i>Psychotechnics?</i>

01:02:26.934 --> 01:02:29.388
Practical applications of psychology.

01:02:29.518 --> 01:02:31.343
<i>Like political propaganda?</i>

01:02:31.476 --> 01:02:35.518
Smart boy!
With help from the CIA, in 1967,

01:02:35.643 --> 01:02:40.383
<i>he moved with his wife Helga
and two-year-old son Ruben to Washington D.C.</i>

01:02:40.809 --> 01:02:42.350
What did he do for the CIA?

01:02:42.476 --> 01:02:45.427
Experiments with subliminal
perception, for the Special

01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:48.553
Activities Division, where
John Cooper worked too.

01:02:48.809 --> 01:02:53.799
His wife died in a car accident in 1975.
And... here,

01:02:53.934 --> 01:02:56.933
an obituary. He died of a
heart attack one month ago.

01:02:57.184 --> 01:02:58.595
Last known address?

01:02:59.184 --> 01:03:01.093
<i>842 Bladensburg Road.</i>

01:03:01.518 --> 01:03:04.517
Thanks. Call the cops to Cooper's house.

01:03:04.643 --> 01:03:06.432
<i>Okay. What's the crime?</i>

01:03:07.393 --> 01:03:08.389
Murder.

01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:37.594
What's up, Kowalski? Let's go!

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:16.928
Ah, so you wanna play...

01:04:36.518 --> 01:04:37.514
Bring it on!

01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:34.717
<i>Gun fight, gun fight, gun fight!</i>

01:06:34.934 --> 01:06:39.058
<i>I don't want a gun fight, Tom is my friend!</i>

01:06:41.601 --> 01:06:42.383
Hey, hey, hey!

01:06:48.101 --> 01:06:49.511
Andy Warhol's Elvis?

01:07:00.184 --> 01:07:02.093
<i>John, it's just a game.</i>

01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:19.888
Double Elvis among these kids.
Kid, kid, kid, kid... Double Elvis again!

01:07:21.643 --> 01:07:28.054
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 22,
23, 24, 25! Elvis again!

01:07:36.143 --> 01:07:38.975
The Sea Witch from the Little Mermaid!

01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:43.261
Sea Witch, Sea Witch, Sea Witch...
Botticelli's Venus?

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:51.055
1, 2, 3, 4... 22, 23, 24, 25...
Botticelli again!

01:07:56.059 --> 01:07:57.683
Bremen Town Musicians!

01:08:00.226 --> 01:08:04.173
Cat, cat, cat... and the Olympia!

01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:09.135
Marina, you won't believe this!

01:08:09.268 --> 01:08:12.432
The Collector's identity is hidden
in Gerhard's laboratory.

01:08:12.559 --> 01:08:14.183
<i>Oh my god!
What did you find?</i>

01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:19.590
Thanks for the information!

01:08:33.059 --> 01:08:34.600
<i>Mike! Mike!</i>

01:08:35.725 --> 01:08:38.014
Excuse me, Marina! What is going on?

01:08:38.143 --> 01:08:42.765
I don't know. Mike is fighting
with someone. He'll call me when he is done.

01:10:00.643 --> 01:10:02.598
Oh my goodness!

01:10:11.643 --> 01:10:14.891
<i>Hi Mikey, I just bought you a new shirt!</i>

01:10:16.518 --> 01:10:17.514
<i>Mike ?</i>

01:10:19.226 --> 01:10:25.176
Mom? What does the name
Gerhard Brandt mean to you?

01:10:28.601 --> 01:10:32.643
Mom? I asked you a question!

01:10:34.309 --> 01:10:38.682
What does the name
Gerhard Brandt mean to you?

01:10:42.768 --> 01:10:44.641
<i>He was your father.</i>

01:10:49.143 --> 01:10:55.389
<i>He was a scientist,
experimenting with the subconscious.</i>

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:56.928
Did he use cartoons?

01:10:59.434 --> 01:11:03.511
<i>Only on your half brother, Ruben.</i>

01:11:05.143 --> 01:11:14.767
<i>He... wanted to make him a great artist.
That's why Ruben had nightmares.</i>

01:11:16.768 --> 01:11:26.758
<i>I, I had to leave your father...
to save your dreams...</i>

01:11:36.184 --> 01:11:37.180
Fernando?

01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:50.800
Renoir?
Pierre-Auguste Renoir?

01:11:51.559 --> 01:11:53.966
For fourty years,
I've been discovering

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:57.716
that the queen of all colours is
the colour black, Ruben.

01:11:57.851 --> 01:12:01.217
You're different.
You're a painter, Pierre-Auguste.

01:12:01.768 --> 01:12:03.048
I don't really like black.

01:12:03.559 --> 01:12:06.309
- You'll learn to like it.
- I don't want to learn to like it.

01:12:06.476 --> 01:12:09.593
Come, I'll teach you to throw
yourself into the blackness,

01:12:09.726 --> 01:12:11.930
like a lemming in to the sea of Norway!

01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:14.548
I don't want to throw myself
into the blackness!

01:12:14.684 --> 01:12:18.726
Come freely, we'll jump together!
We'll disappear into the black!

01:12:18.851 --> 01:12:21.257
I don't want to disappear into the black!

01:12:21.393 --> 01:12:26.927
I'll talk you into it, Ruben.
Here, for a starter, have a bit of black!

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:38.388
The next painting is
Bazille's portrait of Renoir.

01:12:50.434 --> 01:12:56.467
They got it! M-m-m-m-mimi is with them.
They're getting into a vintage Tatra.

01:12:56.684 --> 01:13:00.631
<i>I need Mimi at any cost!
The rest can die.</i>

01:13:36.351 --> 01:13:37.347
Watch out!

01:13:37.976 --> 01:13:38.640
Damn!

01:14:06.351 --> 01:14:10.511
Giuseppe, tell Vincenzo not to
worry, we got this covered, okay?

01:14:10.851 --> 01:14:16.766
Hey, hey! Here comes a little
birdy, come on here to daddy!

01:14:27.726 --> 01:14:30.807
Turn, turn, turn...

01:14:33.518 --> 01:14:34.300
Bloody hell!

01:14:37.559 --> 01:14:38.721
Bloody hell!

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.344
Jesus!

01:14:42.309 --> 01:14:43.590
Oh my god!

01:14:43.976 --> 01:14:44.557
Watch out!

01:14:49.934 --> 01:14:52.222
Joe, take the 'copter, the truck is mine!

01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:54.342
Alright, alright, I got it!

01:14:56.851 --> 01:14:57.550
Here we go!

01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:05.056
Come on, Joe... come on...

01:15:11.184 --> 01:15:12.642
How you doing?

01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:14.593
Give it to me!
Give it to me baby!

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:18.224
Haha! You big banana head...

01:15:19.059 --> 01:15:20.517
Have a nice day, mate!

01:15:28.184 --> 01:15:30.591
I'm... I'm the pilot. I'm just a pilot.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:34.140
Okay, okay, okay, I'll jump,
just let me take a parachute.

01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:36.721
No problem, no problem, I'll
jump, I'll jump, I'll jump.

01:15:36.893 --> 01:15:39.678
Boys, it's time to get down!

01:15:42.559 --> 01:15:45.226
Alright, let's have a party!

01:15:46.601 --> 01:15:49.090
Hey! We gonna smash into the overpass!

01:15:49.226 --> 01:15:51.383
Bye-bye guys!

01:15:54.434 --> 01:15:55.430
Watch out!

01:16:10.226 --> 01:16:11.222
Here you go!

01:16:13.518 --> 01:16:15.722
Oh, that won't be easy, baby!

01:16:19.768 --> 01:16:20.764
Mimi!

01:16:23.101 --> 01:16:23.682

01:16:25.643 --> 01:16:28.724
County buggery fucktole bumshite!

01:16:31.101 --> 01:16:32.926
Oh my god!

01:17:21.226 --> 01:17:22.304
Hi, guys!

01:18:58.684 --> 01:19:04.681
Ruben, I'm free!

01:19:05.934 --> 01:19:09.099
I'm free!

01:19:14.559 --> 01:19:15.934
Ruben?

01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:31.845
Well, well, well.

01:19:33.684 --> 01:19:40.179
Frank Duveneck's Whistling Boy was the 11th
and Bazille's Renoir the 12th.

01:19:40.393 --> 01:19:47.681
The last one is Double Elvis. And the Double
Elvis is finally being put on display!

01:19:47.976 --> 01:19:53.049
A Pop Art exhibition in Tokyo. Hockey,
the end of the game is very,

01:19:53.184 --> 01:19:54.891
very near!

01:19:58.434 --> 01:20:03.720
Thanks, Boris! Giuseppe, tell Filippo
to mobilize all the people!

01:20:04.309 --> 01:20:05.424
Yes, boss!

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:17.716
Next robbery is Tokyo, Pop Art Exhibition.
Do you understand?

01:20:18.059 --> 01:20:19.174
<i>Yes, yes, yes,</i>

01:20:19.309 --> 01:20:23.351
I got it. The next robbery is in Tokyo,
at the Pop Art Exhibition.

01:20:23.476 --> 01:20:28.347
Ah, Tokyo! Don't worry, Sir!
Everything is under control!

01:20:28.476 --> 01:20:29.721
Goodbye!

01:20:29.934 --> 01:20:32.850
As far as I understood...
Take it easy,

01:20:32.976 --> 01:20:37.681
Ninocka, take it easy...
I should go to Tokyo. I'll be there.

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:42.134
What do you mean
I don't understand?

01:20:42.268 --> 01:20:46.925
I understand.
The next job will be in Tokyo. Right?

01:20:47.351 --> 01:20:48.927
Not now, I'm busy!

01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:51.850
Not now!

01:20:52.476 --> 01:20:55.806
Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja. Tokyo. I'll be there.

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:58.601
Could you repeat it, please?
I didn't understand. Toronto?

01:20:58.726 --> 01:20:59.757
<i>Tokyo!</i>

01:20:59.893 --> 01:21:05.131
Ah, Tokyo! I like being in Tokyo!
See you the day after tomorrow!

01:21:40.768 --> 01:21:44.098
Places everyone - and let's start!

01:21:47.434 --> 01:21:52.720
It's just so peaceful here, Margaret!
I love it!

01:21:52.851 --> 01:21:59.346
George, sush! Be quiet, the performance
has already started! Look!

01:21:59.476 --> 01:22:05.426
The taking of this painting is
part of the performance art piece.

01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:13.093
In the future, everyone here will
be world famous for 15 minutes!

01:22:41.976 --> 01:22:45.591
Oh my goodness! What... what is going on?

01:22:45.726 --> 01:22:54.058
Sh! Miss, please! Just a little
respect for the performance artists!

01:23:06.309 --> 01:23:14.179
Those were our 15 minutes of fame.

The wheel spins, take a look around!

01:23:54.184 --> 01:24:02.054
