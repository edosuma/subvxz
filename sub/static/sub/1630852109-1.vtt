WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.680 --> 00:11.520
IT'S POINTLESS

00:11.600 --> 00:14.440
TO BE ALIVE ON THE OUTSIDE
IF YOU'RE DEAD ON THE INSIDE

00:25.080 --> 00:26.080
LAST STOP

00:31.120 --> 00:32.840
<i>This stop is Ponte Mammolo.</i>

00:38.040 --> 00:41.400
The first time I saw Alice
was in the summer of 2001.

00:41.480 --> 00:42.880
I didn't have a fucking clue.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.360
I was 17, in my last year of high school.
AS Roma had just won the league.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.400
Are you a football fan?

00:49.480 --> 00:52.080
Isn't this the release party
for the <i>Evangelion</i> DVD?

00:52.160 --> 00:55.400
I had just come back from Genoa,
where the G8 summit was held.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.160
We had been
beaten to a pulp, shot at,

00:58.240 --> 01:02.000
beaten up in our sleep,
and then tortured for three days straight.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.960
Well, I only got slapped
by a forest ranger like Yogi Bear,

01:06.040 --> 01:08.840
but that didn't exactly scream coolness.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.600
I thought it more dignified
to share the collective duty.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.360
The point is, we were all feeling
a whirlwind of emotions

01:14.440 --> 01:15.680
and we were clueless.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.400
We had Manu Chao telling us
to smoke 300 joints a day,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.880
while Tiziano Ferro sang about
throwing yourself off a bridge.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.240
<i>I won't make it alone!</i>

01:26.320 --> 01:29.040
<i>Forgiveness!</i>
<i>If what is done is done, then I'm asking…</i>

01:29.120 --> 01:32.440
Mao Zedong claimed that,
"Great is the confusion under the sky,

01:32.520 --> 01:34.400
so the situation is excellent."

01:34.480 --> 01:37.080
If he was talking about
hormonal confusion,

01:37.160 --> 01:38.200
then I was doing great.

01:41.120 --> 01:44.280
Towards the end of that
kaleidoscopic summer,

01:44.360 --> 01:47.080
I went to a gig with my friend Sarah
who said to me…

01:47.160 --> 01:48.280
Zero, this is Alice.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.520
She's a friend. Keep her company
while I go get the beers.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.040
<i>Nice to meet you. Alice.</i>

01:57.120 --> 01:59.240
She didn't really sound like that,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.880
but it's been ages
and I can't remember her voice.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.560
Maybe she did speak like that,
I don't know, it was so loud.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.480
I had known her for about three seconds

02:08.560 --> 02:10.680
and I was already in love.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.480
I'm not afraid to say it.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.120
I was so in love that I thought,
"You know what?"

02:16.200 --> 02:18.640
"I'm not gonna say shit to her

02:18.720 --> 02:21.840
because if I speak, I'll blush,
and she'll think I'm a loser."

02:21.920 --> 02:25.800
"Instead, I need to seem cool,
like I don't give a fuck."

02:25.880 --> 02:28.320
After all, my emotional growth
had been shaped

02:28.400 --> 02:29.960
by some graffiti near my house

02:30.040 --> 02:33.800
which perfectly encapsulated
classic suburban homophobia…

02:33.880 --> 02:35.160
LOVING GIRLS IS FOR FAGGOTS

02:35.240 --> 02:39.960
…as well as the mysterious heterophobia
that left me feeling quite puzzled.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.320
<i>I feel I ended up in a world</i>
<i>Never seen or understood</i>

02:45.400 --> 02:49.840
<i>I was free</i>

02:51.120 --> 02:54.480
<i>Free…</i>

02:59.640 --> 03:02.000
We met up three or four times that month

03:02.080 --> 03:03.840
and we probably exchanged 15 words,

03:03.920 --> 03:05.920
mostly subtle grammatical variations of…

03:06.000 --> 03:07.440
<i>-Wanna smoke?</i>
-I don't smoke.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.800
"Coming for a smoke?"
"I still don't smoke."

03:09.880 --> 03:11.760
"Remember me? I still don't. Hi."

03:12.400 --> 03:14.560
However, I had noticed several clues

03:14.640 --> 03:17.080
that led me to think
that she felt the same way.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.440
As in, though we barely spoke in person,

03:22.520 --> 03:26.400
we would spend evenings on MSN,
WhatsApp's rustic ancestor,

03:26.480 --> 03:28.400
which allowed us sociopaths to couple up…

03:28.480 --> 03:29.840
HI, ARE YOU MALE OR FEMALE?

03:29.920 --> 03:32.040
…but left some freedom of interpretation.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.000
She added you?
She definitely wants to have sex!

03:37.040 --> 03:39.520
Do not listen to him.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.000
We would share intimate details
as if we had known each other forever.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.360
I didn't have to worry about blushing.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.360
So I acted all cool, full of funny jok--

03:49.840 --> 03:51.720
What the fuck are you doing?

03:51.800 --> 03:55.280
When you see her in person
and you try to say hi,

03:55.360 --> 03:56.920
you sweat like a kebab,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.320
and you stare at your shoes
as if you had jokes written down there!

04:00.400 --> 04:03.920
Our virtual relationship
had become such an intimate staple

04:04.000 --> 04:07.480
that Alice was the only one I told
about wanting to write comics.

04:08.320 --> 04:12.680
She even asked me to write a story
for the kids in her after-school club.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.320
THE PRINCE WHO TRIPS OTHERS

04:15.040 --> 04:16.200
There was this kid

04:16.280 --> 04:18.880
who was terrified
of walking around his neighborhood

04:18.960 --> 04:24.520
because of a bully
known as "the Prince Who Trips Others."

04:24.600 --> 04:27.520
But his mom reassures him
by telling him that, as time passes,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.760
bullies remain ignorant,

04:29.840 --> 04:33.080
while he will become a famous scientist.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.280
And the kid does grow up
to become a famous scientist,

04:36.360 --> 04:38.320
but the bully grows up as well

04:38.400 --> 04:40.520
and he becomes "the Box Cutter Prince"

04:40.600 --> 04:42.080
because he slices people open.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.800
So the scientist is still terrified.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.760
The end.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.600
<i>Zero! You can't have kids read this stuff!</i>

04:49.680 --> 04:53.080
<i>The first part is lovely,</i>
<i>but you need a little hope.</i>

04:53.160 --> 04:55.160
<i>We all need a little hope.</i>

04:55.240 --> 04:57.200
We had a different approach to education,

04:57.280 --> 04:59.160
but the chemistry was insane.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.640
Unfortunately, it never fully developed.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.000
It was like dancing on a rope.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.040
My texts to her
were basically dictated to me by a lawyer.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.080
You need to stick to the gray areas.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.280
Use sufficiently ambiguous words

05:12.360 --> 05:14.720
so that she can see the hints
if she wants to.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.200
But if she's not interested,
you can deny you were either.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.200
For example.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.920
Maybe I say, "It would be nice to hang."

05:22.000 --> 05:24.200
If you want to get it, you do.
But if you reply,

05:24.280 --> 05:26.240
"I already have a boyfriend,"

05:26.320 --> 05:29.560
then I can reply,
"I wasn't asking you out!"

05:29.640 --> 05:31.720
"I just said, 'It would be nice to hang.'"

05:31.800 --> 05:34.560
I could have meant
that if I'm behind you in a queue,

05:34.640 --> 05:36.480
I think, "I could have been waiting

05:36.560 --> 05:39.880
behind the spitting old man,
instead, I have Alice."

05:39.960 --> 05:41.840
"Lucky me. That's nice."

05:41.920 --> 05:45.880
Do you get me? But if I write,
"Would you like to go out?" and you reply,

05:45.960 --> 05:48.240
"Listen, I like you, but no thanks,"

05:48.320 --> 05:51.560
that would be utterly,
atomically humiliating.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.920
Like when the Japanese emperor
surrenders after the atomic bombs

05:55.000 --> 05:56.760
and the puzzled population says…

05:56.840 --> 05:59.640
Fuck no! You can't surrender!

05:59.720 --> 06:01.160
You're the emperor!

06:01.240 --> 06:04.680
It's not the archery competition
at the Club Mediterranée!

06:04.760 --> 06:06.080
We lost the war!

06:06.160 --> 06:08.760
You need to kill yourself
like Mishima did,

06:08.840 --> 06:10.480
you piece of shit!

06:10.560 --> 06:14.520
We couldn't give anything away,
it's the basis of survival.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.080
Yet, I was sure she felt the same.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.880
What if things go well and she says yes?

06:19.960 --> 06:22.240
If you speak clearly,
then you're stuck with her forever.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.560
That's how it works.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.400
The first move is legally binding.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.280
You asked me out.
You can't ditch me after three months.

06:28.360 --> 06:33.160
A first date is a deal signed in blood.
I even brought you wallpaper samples.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.280
I was thinking baby blue for the nursery.
What do you say?

06:36.360 --> 06:39.120
So, we were stuck in this diluted dynamic.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.240
We would write, but never speak.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.600
We were forever sowing, but never reaping.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.960
If it's meant to be, it will be.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.480
Why are we always rushing things?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.160
It's capitalism!

07:12.240 --> 07:15.120
That's why it gave us cocaine,
so we could keep up.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.720
We kept going slowly,
thinking life was meant to be that way.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.640
All you had to do was
slowly tear along the dotted line,

07:21.720 --> 07:24.760
following the line
that would lead us to our destiny,

07:24.840 --> 07:27.200
and finally everything would make sense.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.240
We were 17,
we had all the time in the world.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.480
Like Achilles and the tortoise.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.400
Yo!

07:40.480 --> 07:44.480
Achilles and the tortoise didn't fuck.
He shacked up with Marika from Cinecittà

07:44.560 --> 07:48.080
and the tortoise with another tortoise
from Villa Ada. It had to be said.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.080
I wonder if those two idiots
had any regrets.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.240
Anyway, all that torment

08:15.320 --> 08:17.880
and all that internal anguish
now feels so far away.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.880
The most intense moment
in the last few months

08:19.960 --> 08:22.520
has been choosing what to watch on TV.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.240
I was looking for something on Netflix,
a movie, anything.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.640
I felt I had seen everything,
but it couldn't be.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.280
Netflix has about 800 million movies.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.160
I can't possibly have seen them all.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.640
I spent the evening
browsing and thinking…

08:34.720 --> 08:37.000
Why so many shit movies?

08:37.080 --> 08:40.160
Don't say that!
They won't give you any more work.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.720
Do you think
this trash you're making is better?

08:42.800 --> 08:46.200
Lie low, man. If this turns out bad,
we're all fucked, me included.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.840
The armadillo was right.
It's not all shit.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.800
But I've already seen the good stuff.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.800
I wanted to watch something

08:52.880 --> 08:56.200
that everybody was talking about
a while ago so I could join in,

08:56.280 --> 08:57.760
but people have moved on

08:57.840 --> 09:00.600
because six months have gone by,
so what's the point?

09:01.120 --> 09:03.960
I'd be like da Vinci
going to NASA and saying…

09:04.040 --> 09:07.520
Look! I discovered
I may be able to make a flying machine!

09:07.600 --> 09:09.920
-And rightly so, they reply…
-Be quiet!

09:10.000 --> 09:12.960
We're working on a ramp on the Moon

09:13.040 --> 09:15.440
to harness gravity
and send our shuttle to Mars.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.160
You come here
with your cute drawings on papyrus!

09:20.240 --> 09:21.240
I LOVE FLY
LEONARDO

09:21.320 --> 09:25.080
Go play with my son's kite. Tonight
the nice lady will bring your medicine.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.320
There are some shows
I've been saving for happy times.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.320
Like the second season of <i>Sense8.</i>

09:31.400 --> 09:33.120
I've been waiting 14 years.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.560
I'm not gonna waste it
on a crappy apathetic evening.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.000
I want to savor it.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.240
I'll keep it for when I'm in a good mood.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.880
<i>Dr. Thomas is unavailable.</i>

09:49.760 --> 09:50.640
Grandpa!

09:50.720 --> 09:54.080
Has there ever been a night
when you were in a good mood?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.240
Anyway, I got obsessed.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.120
I spent two hours
browsing the titles in a frenzy.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.240
Christ, there has to be something decent!

10:07.320 --> 10:08.560
A MUTE ALIEN MEETS A HOARSE DOG…

10:08.640 --> 10:10.800
Even some subtitled
'50s Polish sci-fi!

10:11.320 --> 10:14.800
It got to 4:00 a.m.
so I went to bed frustrated

10:14.880 --> 10:17.480
and having not watched a thing,
then I heard the armadillo…

10:17.560 --> 10:20.320
If out of 8,000 movies
you don't like even one,

10:20.400 --> 10:21.720
maybe the problem is you.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.960
I questioned myself and I had to agree.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.320
I am the problem.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.360
If I'm missing something inside,
how can I find it outside?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.760
But I just wanted to watch TV,

10:34.840 --> 10:36.840
not have a therapy session,
for fuck's sake!

10:42.240 --> 10:44.200
Anyway, I didn't have time for that.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.960
I had bigger fish to fry.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.240
No, you can't show up like that.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.240
What, in a tracksuit?

10:50.320 --> 10:54.680
I can't believe there are still places
you can't show up in a tracksuit.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.480
Even at the Vienna Opera Ball

10:56.560 --> 10:58.200
you should be able to go casual.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.160
In Naples they get this.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.800
Even priests and ministers
wear tracksuits.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.440
If it's a formal occasion,
they go for a shiny one.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.920
Get changed in the bathroom.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.840
In the bathroom?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.480
How sweet, I guess women's bathrooms

11:13.560 --> 11:17.240
must be delightful places
ruled by cooperation and respect

11:17.320 --> 11:18.920
for those who are yet to come.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.520
Please enter, stranger!

11:20.600 --> 11:23.320
I lowered the seat
as I was awaiting your arrival!

11:23.400 --> 11:25.160
Thank you, sister!

11:25.240 --> 11:27.760
I've never seen one,
but this is how they must be

11:27.840 --> 11:29.960
if you think I can change in there.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.240
Men's bathrooms are not like that.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.880
They're like Vietnam.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.840
As you enter,
the smell of piss attacks your nostrils.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.480
The guy ahead of you looks at you
with no hint of mercy or brotherhood,

11:41.560 --> 11:42.600
and his eyes say…

11:42.680 --> 11:45.440
I did my thing.
I only care about getting out alive.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.960
You're fucked.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.880
The piss comes up to your knees

11:49.960 --> 11:52.840
because men don't use the bowl to piss in.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.000
No, it simply serves as a reminder

11:55.080 --> 11:56.920
that you're in the crapper.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.120
Men piss next to it, behind it, around it…
Anywhere in the stall is good.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.560
You don't even look at the bowl,
even Nietzsche said it.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.400
If you stare at the abyss,
the abyss will stare back.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.920
In this instance, the abyss is
a shit as big as a baboon's arm.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.720
Do you really think
I can change my pants in there?

12:15.800 --> 12:18.160
I would have to take my shoes off

12:18.240 --> 12:20.960
and wade through piss just wearing socks.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.120
Give me a break. It can't be done.
I'm sure you get it.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.520
Unbelievable.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.040
What is?

12:28.120 --> 12:31.040
You have built millennia of male dominance

12:31.120 --> 12:32.720
on your victim complex.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.680
Look…

12:34.160 --> 12:38.360
Us ladies, we have to sit down.
On the seat, bacteria grow like on Pluto.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.960
To avoid touching it
we've developed leg muscles

12:41.040 --> 12:43.120
that could crack a walnut.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.840
But it's not enough, so we have to
reach for the walls like Spider-Man.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.640
On top of that, the door is always broken.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.880
If someone comes in while you're
mid-piss, they only see your back.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.960
But they would see us
full-frontal, contorted in pain,

12:57.040 --> 13:00.120
with eyes wide open
like a deer caught in the headlights.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.120
That's why we always
go to the bathroom in pairs

13:03.200 --> 13:06.280
and the lines are about four years long.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.800
You go in, piss wherever you please,
and you leave.

13:09.880 --> 13:13.480
But the poor little prince
doesn't like the smell!

13:14.320 --> 13:17.880
I'd like to reply, but I feel
my right to whine has been taken away.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.200
I've been robbed of a crucial element

13:20.280 --> 13:22.960
of the holy male constitution.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.880
WE SUFFER MORE
WE SACRIFICE MORE

13:24.960 --> 13:26.400
This eats me up inside,

13:26.480 --> 13:29.800
yet I have been robbed,
so I can still whine about that.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.040
I'm still in my comfort zone.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.560
In the end, I had to do it.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.400
I tried to balance
with my feet over the shoes on one leg,

13:38.480 --> 13:41.000
like a flamingo,
and, of course, it didn't work.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.800
I dropped my pants in the piss.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.920
And now I'm convinced
I've contracted Ebola.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.560
Which would still be preferable
to the day ahead of me.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.120
