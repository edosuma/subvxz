WEBVTT

00:03.871 --> 00:05.070
- Is Amelia asleep?

00:05.072 --> 00:07.406
- Yeah, I just checked.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.340
- You feel good.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.741
- Mm, yeah?

00:09.743 --> 00:10.743
- Yeah.

00:10.745 --> 00:13.979
Do you mind if I make a detour?

00:13.981 --> 00:15.814
- Oh, I don't
know, let me check.

00:17.084 --> 00:21.220
Permission granted,
sailor, climb aboard.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.421
- Okay.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.222
- I think you're all
good, you're all clear.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.590
- Alright, (chuckles)

00:24.592 --> 00:27.092
I'm glad I have
permission from your area.

00:27.094 --> 00:30.229
- Oh, you've got
more than permission,

00:30.231 --> 00:33.632
you've got an all-access pass!

00:33.634 --> 00:34.900
- Okay, I'm done.

00:34.902 --> 00:35.801
- What?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.402
No, no, no, no, no, (chuckles)

00:37.404 --> 00:38.270
I'm not giving this up,
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,

00:38.272 --> 00:40.072
go, go, go, go, go.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.406
- Alright.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.474
I still don't know
why your vagina

00:42.476 --> 00:44.777
has to sound like Brad Garrett.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.745
- Would you prefer Ray?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.013
Debra!

00:48.015 --> 00:48.814
Ma!

00:50.350 --> 00:51.950
What about the twins?

00:53.153 --> 00:54.353
Guess who the twins are.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.387
- [Mike] Who?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.655
- My boobs.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.358
- [Mike] Oh God.
(Andrea chuckles)

00:59.360 --> 01:01.794
(upbeat music)

01:16.043 --> 01:17.209
- Here.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.744
- How about this one?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.812
- Ah, yeah, we gotta keep
that, look at that face.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.314
- Cool, what about this one?

01:23.284 --> 01:24.215
- Garbage.

01:24.217 --> 01:25.084
- Okay.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.351
- Hand prints, not interested.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.686
- I feel guilty doing
this while she's asleep.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.220
- Really?

01:29.222 --> 01:31.423
Would you prefer that she
was awake and furious?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.291
- No.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.558
- Yeah, I don't think so.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.827
We gotta sift through
all this preschool crap,

01:34.829 --> 01:36.762
otherwise our house
is gonna be taken over

01:36.764 --> 01:39.164
by elaborate portrayals
of her bunny Walter.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.866
- Ooh, what's he doing there?

01:40.868 --> 01:45.070
- Oh, I'm pretty sure that
Walter has bulimia, yeah.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.240
I've also noticed some alarming
acid erosion on his teeth,

01:48.242 --> 01:51.744
one of the lesser-known
signs of bulimia.

01:51.746 --> 01:53.912
- You find the strangest
things to be smug about.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.647
- Like how I don't
have to wear deodorant?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.483
- No, we went over this, you
do need to wear deodorant.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.920
- 'Cause my body's so hot,
it makes itself sweat?

02:01.922 --> 02:05.057
- Moving on, uh, your birthday's
coming up, you excited?

02:05.059 --> 02:06.091
- No, I'm not.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.326
- Why not?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.061
- Well, not because I'm
sad it's my birthday,

02:09.063 --> 02:11.463
I've accepted that I'm a
dried husk of a human being,

02:11.465 --> 02:12.731
I'm just annoyed
that I have to have

02:12.733 --> 02:14.533
this party with Jill again.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.935
- You don't have to,
you're choosing to.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.937
- Well, I know, but
I've known her forever,

02:18.939 --> 02:20.806
her birthday falls on
the same day as mine,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.207
which, for some reason,

02:22.209 --> 02:24.877
when we were waitressing
14 years ago,

02:24.879 --> 02:26.478
that seemed significant.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.747
- You literally have nothing
in common with her anymore.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.948
- Honey, what am
I supposed to do,

02:29.950 --> 02:31.317
just suddenly, after a decade,

02:31.319 --> 02:33.519
say I'm not having my
birthday with her anymore

02:33.521 --> 02:34.953
for no apparent reason?

02:34.955 --> 02:37.088
- The reason is you're dreading
it and it's your birthday.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.825
- (sighs) It seems like so much
more work to get out of it.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.294
It's like starting
chemo in your 80s,

02:42.296 --> 02:43.829
at a certain point,

02:43.831 --> 02:45.430
don't you just climb into
your bed in the living room

02:45.432 --> 02:47.566
and just let the
cancer wash over you?

02:47.568 --> 02:50.735
- Wow, so in this
situation, Jill is cancer?

02:50.737 --> 02:54.006
- I'm not saying she is,
I'm not saying she's not.

02:54.008 --> 02:57.109
- Okay, uh, if she's
cancer, who am I?

02:57.111 --> 03:00.779
- You're my very controlling
palliative care nurse

03:00.781 --> 03:03.515
that I don't have the strength
to fight off in hospice.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.783
- I'm listening.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.986
- Hey, why don't you
pull my catheter out?

03:06.988 --> 03:09.755
I'm not here for a long time,
I'm here for a good time.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.722
- You're disgusting.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.923
- What?

03:11.925 --> 03:13.525
If this is my one last
wish before I die,

03:13.527 --> 03:15.561
you're not gonna
pull my catheter out

03:15.563 --> 03:17.863
and have sex with
me like a gentleman?

03:17.865 --> 03:18.997
- Oh, no, I totally will.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.998
- Thank you.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.266
- You're welcome.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.135
- That's why we're together.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.704
By the way, yellow is a pear.

03:26.741 --> 03:27.773
That's fucking bullshit.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.141
- It's garbage.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.710
(upbeat music)

03:34.948 --> 03:37.816
- Oh my God, should we keep
our kids out of school today?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.017
- Hey, guys.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.085
- Check your email.

03:40.087 --> 03:40.986
- Why?

03:40.988 --> 03:42.221
- The nurse just sent one out,

03:42.223 --> 03:43.989
apparently someone in
our class has lice.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.991
- Oh my God,
seriously, who is it?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.226
- I don't know, it doesn't say.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.093
- Really?

03:48.095 --> 03:49.561
- Yeah.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.763
- Well, I wanna know if it's
someone Amelia hangs out with,

03:50.765 --> 03:51.964
I'll ask the school
nurse who it is.

03:51.966 --> 03:52.765
- Alright, let us know
what you find out.

03:52.767 --> 03:53.599
- Will do.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.038
I actually have no clue
where the nurse's office is.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.573
- Oh, it's just down
the hall to the right.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.375
My kid is a hypochondriac.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.976
- Thank him for me.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.846
- Well, if he's not under
the weather, then I will.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.714
(upbeat music)

04:08.716 --> 04:10.249
- Hi, good morning.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.583
I'm Andrea, Amelia Harris's mom.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.052
- Oh, hi, yeah,
nice to meet you.

04:13.054 --> 04:14.586
- You too.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.787
Um, I had a quick question
about the lice notice

04:15.789 --> 04:16.622
that went out to
the kindergartners.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.856
- Oh, sure.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.391
- I just wanted
to know who it was

04:19.393 --> 04:20.426
so I could see if it's
someone that my daughter,

04:20.428 --> 04:21.927
you know, spends time around.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.630
- Oh, yeah, we don't give
out that information.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.265
- Really?

04:26.267 --> 04:28.634
- Yeah, it's confidential,
people get very sensitive.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.836
- Oh, okay, so you guys will
just do the lice checks here

04:30.838 --> 04:32.871
and then let us know
if there's an issue?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.873
- No, we don't do
lice checks here.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.241
- Okay.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.477
- We recommend you
checking your child's head.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.846
You know, either yourself
or through a service.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.850
- Okay, so you don't
tell us who it is

04:44.852 --> 04:47.819
and you don't do
the lice checks?

04:47.821 --> 04:48.587
- That's right.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.290
- What do you do? (chuckles)

04:51.292 --> 04:52.191
- We sent the email.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.260
- Ah-ha, well,

04:55.262 --> 04:57.296
what happens if
people don't heed

04:57.298 --> 04:59.465
the voluntary recommendation?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.834
I mean, how do we
get the lice to stop

05:01.836 --> 05:03.836
just being passed
back and forth?

05:03.838 --> 05:05.437
How do we get it to stop?

05:05.439 --> 05:07.072
- Most people do
the right thing.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.441
- Do they?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.209
- Yeah.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.512
- Well, you never met
my college boyfriend,

05:13.514 --> 05:15.748
downstairs lice, would've
loved a heads-up.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.651
- I'm sure.

05:18.653 --> 05:21.253
- Sorry, you probably
didn't need to know that.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.921
- You said you
were Amelia's mom?

05:25.059 --> 05:25.924
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.996 --> 05:29.795
Thank you.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.164
Bye.

05:33.134 --> 05:36.101
(upbeat music)

05:36.103 --> 05:37.503
Jill, hi.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.737
- Hi, I'm so sorry I'm late,

05:38.739 --> 05:40.072
class ran a little bit long.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.073
- Oh my God, class, what
class are you taking?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.208
- You know how mixology

05:43.210 --> 05:45.744
has become a huge
passion of mine, right?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.212
- No, I did not know that.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.514
- I love it.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.548
- Great.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.483
- Bartending school is amazing,

05:51.485 --> 05:54.687
today we did floaters,
it's, like, legit chemistry.

05:54.689 --> 05:56.888
- That's awesome,
congratulations.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.557
- Oh my gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.424
- I know.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.326
- Should we just order some apps

06:00.328 --> 06:01.560
and then decide what we want?

06:01.562 --> 06:02.828
- We may have to order
everything at once,

06:02.830 --> 06:04.563
I'm sorry, I gotta pick
up Amelia in an hour.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.166
- (groans) That baby is
ruining our friendship.

06:07.168 --> 06:10.536
- (chuckles) Well,
that baby is six, so...

06:10.538 --> 06:12.037
- What, are you serious?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.138
- Mm-hmm.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.974
- God, can you
believe we're over 40?

06:15.976 --> 06:18.544
Doesn't it feel like
we're just, like, 25?

06:19.646 --> 06:20.446
- No.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.715
- (chuckles) You're so funny.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.783
I miss your face.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.352
- You too, your face.
- How are you?

06:26.354 --> 06:29.188
How's Mike, how's
Amelia, how's writing?

06:29.190 --> 06:31.256
- Everything's
good, Mike is good,

06:31.258 --> 06:33.192
writing's been a
little challenging,

06:33.194 --> 06:34.126
I sold this project

06:34.128 --> 06:35.394
and now we're suddenly getting

06:35.396 --> 06:36.729
all these contradictory notes,

06:36.731 --> 06:38.263
we are on our fourth outline.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.665
I don't know, the whole thing
might fall apart, who knows.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.134
- I still feel
like it must be fun

06:42.136 --> 06:43.669
to just write jokes all day.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.737
- Well...
- You must just laugh.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.605
(message notification)

06:46.607 --> 06:47.873
- Yeah, but we also, right now,

06:47.875 --> 06:49.742
we're just more, like,
breaking story and,

06:49.744 --> 06:51.142
you know, having
to do the outlines,

06:51.144 --> 06:52.143
and deadlines, and stuff.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.011
- Fuck!

06:53.013 --> 06:54.380
Sorry.

06:54.382 --> 06:55.581
- Is everything alright?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.949
- It's Doug.

06:56.951 --> 06:59.685
I told you I broke
up with him, right?

06:59.687 --> 07:00.952
- I'm not sure.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.020
- He's asking for
my Netflix account,

07:02.022 --> 07:05.391
"No, and get an f'ing job."

07:05.393 --> 07:08.394
He doesn't even own
a car, it had to end.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.398
- Then it sounds like you did
the right thing by ending it.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.032
- Honestly,

07:14.034 --> 07:14.900
I'm just gonna get a baby
and move on with my life,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.068
'cause it's time.

07:17.438 --> 07:20.806
- I would definitely
give some thought to,

07:20.808 --> 07:22.373
you know, getting a baby.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.842
- Obviously.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.244
Oh, anyways, so,

07:25.246 --> 07:29.314
we have reservations at 77 Bar
at 9:00 p.m. for the party.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.849
- Wow.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.050
- Do you want me to put
anyone on the list for you?

07:32.052 --> 07:35.454
- No, I don't, no, I'm good.

07:35.456 --> 07:36.988
Thank you for asking.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.557
Um, I'm ready to order.

07:40.527 --> 07:41.993
You good?

07:41.995 --> 07:44.229
- I shouldn't invite
Doug to the party, right?

07:45.266 --> 07:46.131
- I wouldn't.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.532
- Yeah.

07:47.534 --> 07:48.334
- Yeah.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.670
Um, I'm gonna just,
where's our waiter?

07:51.672 --> 07:54.039
Excuse me.
- Just give me one second.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.675
I just need some time
to look through this.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.850
- Great, I'll give
you a minute to focus.

08:04.852 --> 08:08.686
- Thank you.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.756
(upbeat music)

08:11.758 --> 08:13.025
- I have to break up with her,

08:13.027 --> 08:15.694
I was with her for,
what, 57 minutes?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.762
I was exhausted,

08:17.764 --> 08:20.098
I feel very sorry for
that baby she's getting.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.566
- She's having a baby?

08:21.568 --> 08:24.203
- No, she's getting a
baby, don't worry about it.

08:24.205 --> 08:27.006
Worry about it. (chuckles)

08:27.008 --> 08:28.306
- I am.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.842
- Oh my God, could
you even imagine?

08:29.844 --> 08:31.010
- No.

08:31.012 --> 08:33.379
- Just imagine for one second.

08:33.381 --> 08:34.379
- Oh, it's bad.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.814
- Real bad. (Mike chuckles)

08:35.816 --> 08:37.383
Alright, I just gotta
get through this year

08:37.385 --> 08:39.251
and then I am out.

08:39.253 --> 08:40.586
- Well, I just hope she
graduates from bartending school

08:40.588 --> 08:41.854
before the baby comes.

08:41.856 --> 08:43.222
- Right?

08:43.224 --> 08:44.523
I mean, it's day three of a
10-day curriculum, hard to say.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.059
- Well, I found some
bugs and some nits.

08:47.061 --> 08:49.862
- Oh my God, okay, well,
what do we gotta do?

08:49.864 --> 08:51.797
- Well, I just comb it through
and put the treatment in.

08:51.799 --> 08:52.865
- Alright, well, let's do it.

08:52.867 --> 08:53.932
Thank you, Nadia.

08:53.934 --> 08:54.867
- Okay.

08:54.869 --> 08:56.802
- Mommy, so I have lice?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.437
- Yep, you got the lice, boo,

08:58.439 --> 08:59.638
but don't worry,
it's no big deal,

08:59.640 --> 09:00.673
they just comb
through your hair,

09:00.675 --> 09:01.940
they'll put some stuff in it,

09:01.942 --> 09:03.341
and then we'll get
to go home, alright?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.477
- So I can play on your phone?

09:05.479 --> 09:08.681
- Very cool for someone
who's got lice, I get it,

09:08.683 --> 09:11.083
but no, finish your
homework, my friend.

09:11.085 --> 09:13.752
- So, is there a way to, uh,
tell how long she's had it?

09:13.754 --> 09:17.422
- You can tell by where she
is in her development cycle.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.425
- Oh, I love a lady
who knows her louse.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.894
- Thank you.

09:21.896 --> 09:22.895
- Does that mean we should
all get checked too?

09:22.897 --> 09:24.028
- I would recommend it.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.097
- Okay.
- Alright.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.466
I'll go first.

09:27.468 --> 09:30.168
(upbeat music)

09:30.170 --> 09:31.704
Well, this is delightful.

09:31.706 --> 09:33.672
- Nadia also said we have
to put all our towels

09:33.674 --> 09:35.107
in the dryer for an hour.

09:35.109 --> 09:36.241
- (sighs) Cool, cool, cool.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.476
- And don't forget
to grab the pillow.

09:37.478 --> 09:38.711
- I really do not wanna
be dealing with this,

09:38.713 --> 09:40.445
Rob and I need to focus
on that Sony meeting.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.647
I have a question,

09:41.649 --> 09:45.084
why is it that I have
lice and you are fine?

09:45.086 --> 09:47.119
- I mean, I'm not surprised.

09:47.121 --> 09:51.323
- No, no, I'm not enjoying
this superior look,

09:51.325 --> 09:53.325
'cause you know
what passes on lice?

09:53.327 --> 09:54.259
Snuggling,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.695
- Oh.
- cuddling, love, okay?

09:56.697 --> 09:58.464
So why are you so distant
from your child, Mike?

09:58.466 --> 10:00.665
Maybe that's a question you
need to be asking yourself.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.067
- There's literally not a world

10:02.069 --> 10:03.736
where you're gonna make me
feel bad for not having lice.

10:03.738 --> 10:04.937
- (chuckles) Please,
please feel bad.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.272
- Mommy, what about
Walter, can he stay out?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.742
- No, loves, I'm sorry,
he's gotta go in the bag,

10:09.744 --> 10:11.477
but he's got a lotta
friends in there.

10:11.479 --> 10:14.613
♪ They're gonna have a party ♪

10:14.615 --> 10:15.880
- I'm gonna miss him.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.283
Where's the picture I
drew of him singing?

10:18.285 --> 10:19.718
- Singing.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.687
- No, you don't get breath
like that from singing.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.089
- Where did it go?

10:24.091 --> 10:25.524
- I think I know where it is.

10:25.526 --> 10:27.559
I'll go get it while you
get ready for bed, okay?

10:27.561 --> 10:29.327
- I'll go brush my teeth.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.696
- Oh my God,

10:30.698 --> 10:32.564
are we now supposed to
vacuum this goddamn mattress?

10:32.566 --> 10:33.966
- Yeah, probably.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.267
(Andrea groans)

10:35.269 --> 10:36.769
Hey, I don't know
if this is the time,

10:36.771 --> 10:39.071
but you kinda look like one
of those Robert Palmer girls.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.338
- Really?

10:40.340 --> 10:43.175
Do you wanna fuck me
or just fuck all of us?

10:43.177 --> 10:44.476
- All of 'em.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.744
- Oh, is this the
time for you to have

10:45.746 --> 10:47.780
that 30-some you've
always been wanting?

10:47.782 --> 10:49.081
- (chuckles) Yeah.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.450
- Cool, just, you
know, lotta mouths,

10:51.452 --> 10:53.052
also, a lotta teeth.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.855
(upbeat music)

10:56.857 --> 10:59.391
(message notification)
Alright, there's the email.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.860
Another kid in kindergarten's
got lice, everybody.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.862
- Lice, are you fucking serious?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.664
- I am super-fucking serious.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.931
- You know who has it?

11:06.933 --> 11:09.668
- I do, it's my
daughter, and me.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.071
- This is why you don't
hire female writers.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.874
- Right? Thank you, I have
been saying that for years,

11:15.876 --> 11:18.944
and nobody listens, they
just keep hiring us.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.612
- I can't believe you're
just walking around

11:20.614 --> 11:21.980
openly telling people

11:21.982 --> 11:25.150
that your head has bugs
crawling all over it.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.585
- Rob, it's lice,

11:26.587 --> 11:28.487
I don't know why there's
such a stigma against it,

11:28.489 --> 11:29.388
it's not the scarlet letter,

11:29.390 --> 11:31.757
my daughter's not a whore, okay?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.492
That was the whores,
right, not the witches?

11:33.494 --> 11:34.626
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that was whores.

11:34.628 --> 11:35.794
- Okay.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.762
- I spent a lotta
time with that book

11:36.764 --> 11:37.395
when I was in eighth grade.

11:37.397 --> 11:37.997
- Yeah?

11:39.400 --> 11:40.366
- Yeah.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.401
- Do you like these eyebrows?

11:42.403 --> 11:44.002
- They're going up,
they're going down,

11:44.004 --> 11:45.404
yeah, I like 'em, (Andrea
chuckles) they're good.

11:45.406 --> 11:47.206
- You wanna know what my
book of choice was back then?

11:47.208 --> 11:48.807
The Jungle.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.575
- Wait.

11:49.577 --> 11:50.843
- Upton Sinclair.

11:50.845 --> 11:53.178
- His expose of the
meatpacking industry?

11:53.180 --> 11:57.115
- People falling into vats
of food in the summer.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.250
- Actually, it wasn't
during the summer,

11:58.252 --> 11:59.818
'cause it was set mainly
during the winter.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.020
- Can you just let me do

12:01.022 --> 12:02.855
my very arousing
Upton Sinclair bit?

12:02.857 --> 12:03.989
- Fine, fine, fine, fine,

12:03.991 --> 12:05.590
but consider this your
early birthday present.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.994
- You know what, more than I
was expecting, so thank you.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.230
- What are you doing for
your 50th, by the way?

12:11.232 --> 12:13.832
- First of all, it's my 60th.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.002
I have to do this joint birthday
party that I am dreading.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.671
- Who has a joint
birthday party?

12:18.673 --> 12:20.138
- Trust me, you
do not wanna know,

12:20.140 --> 12:22.207
it's this girl I used
to waitress with,

12:22.209 --> 12:24.142
I don't know, it's not great.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.211
- My head is itching,
do I have lice?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.812
- Oh, Rob, you don't have lice.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.681
Even if you did, it
is not a big deal.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.284
Okay, you go to a place,
they do their thing,

12:32.286 --> 12:34.887
and two days later, you
go back and you're done.

12:34.889 --> 12:37.422
(upbeat music)

12:37.424 --> 12:40.859
Oh, you gotta be fucking
kidding me, seriously?

12:42.663 --> 12:43.962
God dammit!

12:46.467 --> 12:48.233
(upbeat music)

12:48.235 --> 12:50.269
I mean, are you shitting me?

12:50.271 --> 12:52.838
I didn't even know it was a
possibility to still have lice,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.606
I thought the second
meeting with Nadia

12:54.608 --> 12:56.742
was just, like, a
courtesy followup.

12:56.744 --> 12:58.076
I really understand

12:58.078 --> 13:00.245
Walter's bulimic need
for control right now.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.813
- Pillow's gotta go in
the dryer for an hour.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.615
- I'm so tired, what time is it?

13:03.617 --> 13:04.883
- It's almost eight.

13:04.885 --> 13:08.320
- (groans) Oh my
God, are you serious?

13:09.423 --> 13:10.689
(upbeat music)

13:10.691 --> 13:11.556
After this,

13:11.558 --> 13:12.824
I still have to go through

13:12.826 --> 13:13.959
all of my and Rob's
notes from today.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.160
- Oh, are you kidding?

13:15.162 --> 13:15.894
- No.
- I'll take care of this,

13:15.896 --> 13:17.062
I got this.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.664
- Honey, no, there's
way too much to do.

13:18.666 --> 13:21.433
This time, we have to clean
every single thing in here,

13:21.435 --> 13:22.868
I am not going
through this again.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.369
- Oh, I get it.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.671
- (groans) I can't believe
I still have to suffer

13:25.673 --> 13:28.107
through this goddamn
party this weekend.

13:28.109 --> 13:31.076
By the way, we need to
now give Doug a ride.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.444
- Wait, I thought he
and Jill broke up?

13:32.446 --> 13:34.880
- Oh, that's adorable.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.248
- Oh, yeah, why did
I even say that?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.248
- (chuckles) I don't know.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.650
- Well, why can't he Uber?

13:38.652 --> 13:42.187
- Oh, no, Doug doesn't
believe in smartphones.

13:42.189 --> 13:42.988
- He's so cool.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.890
- He's very cool.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.692
- Well, why doesn't
he ride with Jill?

13:46.694 --> 13:49.328
- (sighs) They're back
together, but in a fight.

13:49.330 --> 13:50.295
- [Mike] Jesus.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.998
- Why is everything so terrible?

13:53.000 --> 13:53.865
- I don't know.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.134
(Andrea groans)

13:55.136 --> 13:56.868
But maybe don't put your
head on the mattress.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.737
- (groans) You're right.

13:58.739 --> 13:59.905
(Andrea groans)

13:59.907 --> 14:01.173
- That's hard to look at.

14:03.344 --> 14:06.011
(Andrea groans)

14:08.482 --> 14:10.983
(upbeat music)

14:12.553 --> 14:14.286
- Well, yeah, Doug, I, I...

14:14.288 --> 14:15.887
You know what,

14:15.889 --> 14:18.724
I will go to YouTube and look
at some of your GoPro videos.

14:18.726 --> 14:20.959
- It's our birthday!

14:20.961 --> 14:21.694
- Hello.

14:21.696 --> 14:23.362
- Hi. (grunts)

14:23.364 --> 14:24.830
Hey, Dave.

14:24.832 --> 14:26.965
Hey, go get a drink, and
get me something too please.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.768
- Wow, looks like you
guys are back together.

14:29.770 --> 14:31.903
- Yeah, and thank you for
driving him, you guys,

14:31.905 --> 14:32.771
it was really sweet.

14:32.773 --> 14:34.573
- So welcome.

14:34.575 --> 14:36.108
- Oh my God, is that a romper?

14:36.110 --> 14:37.343
- Yes, it is.

14:37.345 --> 14:38.577
- I love a romper,

14:38.579 --> 14:40.045
I can never wear them
because I drink so much

14:40.047 --> 14:41.780
and then it makes me
always have to pee, so...

14:41.782 --> 14:42.581
- Ah.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.250
- Michael Harris.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.117
- Hi, Jill.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.586
- You still a lawyer?

14:47.588 --> 14:48.587
- Yes.

14:48.589 --> 14:49.454
- (groans) I love it.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.789
You guys, come in, come in,

14:50.791 --> 14:54.125
everybody's dying to
say hi to you guys.

14:54.127 --> 14:54.994
- Are they?

14:54.996 --> 14:55.961
- What can I get you to drink?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.596
- I will take a Manhattan.

14:57.598 --> 14:58.597
- Yeah, I'd love a beer.

14:58.599 --> 14:59.531
- I think I can remember that.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.400
- Okay, thank you.

15:01.402 --> 15:04.336
Oh my God, she didn't say
no gifts on the invite,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.338
we are grown adults.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.740
- Sorry I didn't
get you anything.

15:07.742 --> 15:11.343
- Mm, well, I'm gonna
need, like, 5-40 drinks.

15:11.345 --> 15:15.014
(dance music plays in bar)

15:15.016 --> 15:18.584
♪ She can get it all night ♪

15:19.587 --> 15:20.419
I

15:21.789 --> 15:24.223
can only do this
for 20 more minutes.

15:24.225 --> 15:24.957
- That's fair.

15:24.959 --> 15:28.227
- (sighs) Okay.

15:28.229 --> 15:29.228
- Oh, hey.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.629
Hi.

15:30.631 --> 15:31.964
- Hi.

15:31.966 --> 15:33.699
Oh my God, I'm Andrea.

15:33.701 --> 15:34.566
- Right, of course. (chuckles)

15:34.568 --> 15:35.434
- Mike.

15:35.436 --> 15:37.369
- Yes, Michelle.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.606
- Yes, hi. (Mike chuckles)

15:40.608 --> 15:42.574
- God, I haven't
seen you in, like--

15:42.576 --> 15:45.444
- I'm gonna guess, probably,
it's been about a year.

15:45.446 --> 15:46.378
- (chuckles) Right.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.212
- So crazy.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.314
- Right, it's so crazy.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.649
How are you?

15:50.651 --> 15:52.384
- Good, how are you?

15:52.386 --> 15:53.785
- Good.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.553
Good.

15:56.190 --> 15:59.124
- Great, well, you know what,
we're gonna get another drink,

15:59.126 --> 16:00.259
but so good to see you.

16:00.261 --> 16:01.427
- Yes, do, have a drink.

16:01.429 --> 16:02.995
- Yes, cheers.
(Michelle chuckles)

16:02.997 --> 16:04.195
Bye.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.130
- (chuckles) She's nice.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.865
- She's nice,

16:06.867 --> 16:08.267
but I can't have
that conversation a
thousand more times.

16:08.269 --> 16:10.869
(upbeat music)

16:15.643 --> 16:17.075
Mm.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.243
Ah, it looks like someone

16:18.245 --> 16:19.478
brought the right
gift to the party.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.879
- (chuckles) Thank you.

16:20.881 --> 16:22.081
I'm happy to share.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.416
- Oh, I'm not usually
a big pot smoker,

16:24.418 --> 16:25.884
although,

16:25.886 --> 16:28.153
I'm also not usually a stranger
to my own birthday party,

16:28.155 --> 16:30.089
I think I will take
some, thank you.

16:30.091 --> 16:31.223
- How do you know Jill?

16:31.225 --> 16:33.158
- Uh, we met at
Coachella six years ago

16:33.160 --> 16:34.827
and just stayed in touch.

16:34.829 --> 16:37.096
- That tracks, that
sounds about right.

16:37.098 --> 16:38.630
- Yes, it does.

16:38.632 --> 16:42.033
- By the way, thank you for
that, it's already helping.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.435
- Oh, good.
- Thank you.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.304
- The cake is happening
in five minutes.

16:45.306 --> 16:48.239
The bartenders are gonna
round up everyone in the bar

16:48.241 --> 16:50.642
and make them all sing to us.

16:50.644 --> 16:52.878
Do you feel like we
should get up on a table?

16:52.880 --> 16:53.712
- No.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.848
I'm gonna actually run to
the bathroom really quick,

16:56.850 --> 16:58.917
but I will make sure to be
back for the big moment.

16:58.919 --> 16:59.652
- Five minutes.

16:59.654 --> 17:00.652
- Five minutes?

17:00.654 --> 17:01.453
- Yes, please.
- Alright,

17:01.455 --> 17:02.854
I'll be back in three.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.055
- [Jill] Okay.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.524
- [Andrea] Time
me. (Jill chuckles)

17:05.526 --> 17:06.525
- I don't have my phone.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.566
(Andrea sighs)

17:51.739 --> 17:54.473
(exhales loudly)

17:59.146 --> 18:01.513
(Andrea hits stall door)

18:01.515 --> 18:02.915
- [Woman] Are you okay?

18:04.118 --> 18:04.950
- Oh.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.820
Yeah, oh my God.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.558
(exhales loudly) I just
got a little dizzy.

18:16.129 --> 18:16.895
Sorry.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.002
It's my birthday, so...

18:24.805 --> 18:25.604
- Careful.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.272
Can I give you a hand?

18:27.274 --> 18:31.142
- Oh, God no, no, no,
no, so, thank you though,

18:31.144 --> 18:34.012
you're very sweet. (chuckles)

18:34.014 --> 18:34.747
I'll just go, uh,

18:36.684 --> 18:37.483
wash my hands.

18:40.221 --> 18:42.187
(upbeat music)

18:42.189 --> 18:43.756
(Andrea groans)

18:43.758 --> 18:46.225
- Did you break your
fall with your face?

18:46.227 --> 18:47.959
- (chuckles) No, I
think my eye socket

18:47.961 --> 18:49.828
hooked the door
handle on my way down.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.430
- Oh, God.

18:51.432 --> 18:55.033
- But at least my vagina was
out, so all was not lost.

18:55.035 --> 18:56.501
- Oh, thank goodness.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.804
That's gonna be a black eye,
I'm gonna give you more ice.

18:58.806 --> 19:01.373
- Why did I drink and smoke pot?

19:01.375 --> 19:03.242
I know that this
doesn't agree with me.

19:03.244 --> 19:05.510
See, this is what happens
when I hang out with her,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.045
I poison my body.

19:07.047 --> 19:08.914
- Yeah.
- This is the last year.

19:08.916 --> 19:09.815
- Does she know that?

19:09.817 --> 19:10.783
- I don't know.

19:10.785 --> 19:12.384
You know what,

19:12.386 --> 19:13.652
I'm not gonna, like, make
a big formal announcement,

19:13.654 --> 19:16.588
I will just not be
available next year

19:16.590 --> 19:19.925
and then let it
naturally fall away.

19:19.927 --> 19:20.826
(message notification)

19:20.828 --> 19:23.629
Oh, fuck me.
- What?

19:23.631 --> 19:24.863
- It's Rob,

19:24.865 --> 19:26.732
I forgot I was supposed
to compile my notes

19:26.734 --> 19:28.199
for our new ending.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.668
- Can you do it
tomorrow? It's 12:30.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.603
- No, he's gotta do
his pass tomorrow,

19:31.605 --> 19:34.006
and then our studio
meeting's on Monday.

19:34.008 --> 19:35.007
- Ooh, with that?

19:35.009 --> 19:36.541
- Oh God.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.677
You know what, I'll just tell
them you beat me, it's fine.

19:38.679 --> 19:40.079
- Thank you.

19:40.081 --> 19:43.148
- Alright, you head upstairs,
I will work down here,

19:43.150 --> 19:44.650
both of us shouldn't
have to suffer.

19:44.652 --> 19:47.018
- Okay, I'm sorry, you want
me to get you anything else?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.954
- No, I'm just gonna first do

19:48.956 --> 19:51.890
a quick Twitter
search for 77 North,

19:51.892 --> 19:55.227
bathroom floor, ass in air,
crotch flapping in the wind,

19:55.229 --> 19:56.695
anything along those lines.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.163
- Nobody's gonna be
tweeting about this.

19:58.165 --> 20:00.231
- You don't know where
Doug hid that GoPro.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.901
- Oh, he could submit this
for a live-action short.

20:02.903 --> 20:04.036
- Ooh, you think so?

20:04.038 --> 20:05.637
- [Mike] Mm.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.673
- Then we gotta head back
to the bar, I have notes,

20:07.675 --> 20:09.008
mostly for my vagina.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.878
I cannot even see well
out of this eye now.

20:14.048 --> 20:16.281
(upbeat music)

20:16.283 --> 20:19.584
Shit, I cannot believe
how bad this looks.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.420
- Yes, it looks very painful.

20:21.422 --> 20:24.289
- Oh my God, I've got this
meeting tomorrow in the morning,

20:24.291 --> 20:25.724
how am I gonna explain this?

20:25.726 --> 20:29.361
I fell out of a
bathroom drunk and high?

20:29.363 --> 20:33.098
(message notification)

20:33.100 --> 20:36.301
No, I don't wanna break down
the night with you, Jill,

20:36.303 --> 20:38.236
that is the last
thing that I wanna do.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.706
Haven't I done all
of my yearly duties?

20:41.708 --> 20:42.875
- Andrea--

20:42.877 --> 20:43.875
- Please do not
come by my house.

20:43.877 --> 20:45.878
- Andrea, I found an egg.

20:48.516 --> 20:49.348
- Okay.

20:53.554 --> 20:55.154
(Andrea sobs)

20:55.156 --> 20:56.021
Fuck.

20:56.023 --> 20:57.422
- Okay.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.289
- I'm sorry.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.225
- No, no, no, I'm sorry.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.394
- Thank you.

21:04.898 --> 21:06.665
(upbeat music)

21:06.667 --> 21:08.801
- I cannot stop
staring at your face,

21:08.803 --> 21:11.203
is it weird to
say it looks sexy?

21:11.205 --> 21:12.171
- Doesn't feel sexy.

21:12.173 --> 21:13.738
- By the way,

21:13.740 --> 21:15.808
you are so lucky you decided
to leave early last night,

21:15.810 --> 21:20.379
Doug got into this (sighs)
crazy fight with a bartender,

21:20.381 --> 21:21.847
and he had to be
escorted outta there,

21:21.849 --> 21:23.315
it was so embarrassing.

21:23.317 --> 21:26.218
- Oh, I guess that
happens with Doug, right?

21:26.220 --> 21:27.786
- It's so funny with him,

21:27.788 --> 21:28.754
because there are days where
I wake up and I'm like,

21:28.756 --> 21:30.322
"I love this guy,"

21:30.324 --> 21:32.291
and then there are other days
I wake up and I'm just like,

21:33.160 --> 21:34.292
"What am I doing?"

21:34.294 --> 21:35.227
Do I care about him?

21:35.229 --> 21:36.094
Yes.

21:36.096 --> 21:37.696
Do I wanna marry him?

21:37.698 --> 21:38.697
Maybe.

21:38.699 --> 21:41.633
- I cannot do this anymore,

21:41.635 --> 21:46.105
I literally cannot hear
about Doug anymore.

21:47.208 --> 21:48.640
I'm so sorry, I...

21:48.642 --> 21:50.509
This is gonna make me
sound like such an asshole,

21:50.511 --> 21:54.880
I don't mean to, I just,
I feel like you and I,

21:56.217 --> 22:00.252
we're just kind of in
different places in our life,

22:00.254 --> 22:01.620
and right now, you know,

22:01.622 --> 22:05.224
my place is black eyes and
bugs crawling through my hair,

22:05.226 --> 22:09.261
so, obviously,
pretty full plate.

22:09.263 --> 22:10.596
- What are you talking about?

22:13.267 --> 22:16.535
(Jill clears throat)
- I just feel like, you know,

22:16.537 --> 22:17.336
maybe

22:18.605 --> 22:19.738
things

22:19.740 --> 22:22.608
have run their course,

22:29.783 --> 22:30.549
with us.

22:38.959 --> 22:41.660
(upbeat music)

22:41.662 --> 22:43.962
I'm not gonna sugarcoat
it, it was rough.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.364
- So you just blurted it out?

22:45.366 --> 22:46.565
- Yeah, I don't know,

22:46.567 --> 22:48.500
I heard my last Doug
and was just like blah.

22:49.704 --> 22:51.303
- How'd she react?

22:51.305 --> 22:54.506
- Not great, turns out she
did not feel similarly.

22:54.508 --> 22:55.441
- Oh.

22:55.443 --> 22:56.875
- There was some language,

22:56.877 --> 22:59.445
she suggested quite a few times
that I intercourse myself.

22:59.447 --> 23:02.981
I assume that wasn't meant
in a pleasurable way, right?

23:02.983 --> 23:03.848
- Right.

23:03.850 --> 23:04.717
Are you okay?

23:04.719 --> 23:05.984
- Yeah.

23:05.986 --> 23:07.886
I mean, it sucked, but
it needed to happen.

23:07.888 --> 23:10.055
Luckily, I didn't have
to go through it alone.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.323
It was kind of a team effort,

23:11.325 --> 23:13.258
we put all our little
parasitic heads together

23:13.260 --> 23:14.727
and just barrelled through.

23:14.729 --> 23:16.328
- Well, I'm proud of each
and every one of you.

23:16.330 --> 23:19.064
- Uh, hold me like
the lice lady.

23:19.066 --> 23:20.665
- What, like this?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.668
- Well, usually I'd be
crying, but it's close.

23:22.670 --> 23:24.202
(Mike chuckles)

23:24.204 --> 23:27.706
- (groans) After Nadia,
your body seems so bony.

23:27.708 --> 23:30.342
I'll tell ya, now I get boobs.

23:30.344 --> 23:31.543
- Okay, now I get boobs.

23:31.545 --> 23:32.578
- Oh.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.580
Don't forget about me, Mike.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.683
- You know what, I've
come to terms with that,

23:37.685 --> 23:39.217
I'm tuning it out.

23:39.219 --> 23:41.820
- What about me, Mike?

23:41.822 --> 23:42.955
- What is that?

23:42.957 --> 23:44.523
- That's my butthole.

23:44.525 --> 23:46.158
Can you tune me out?

23:46.160 --> 23:48.494
Mike, I'm talking to you.

23:48.496 --> 23:50.162
(upbeat music)

23:50.164 --> 23:52.030
- I have to imagine
this is a better way

23:52.032 --> 23:53.365
to celebrate your
birthday, right?

23:53.367 --> 23:55.634
- I don't know, it feels
a little weird to, like,

23:55.636 --> 23:57.102
know everyone at the table

23:57.104 --> 23:59.972
and not have my underwear
around my ankles, you know?

23:59.974 --> 24:02.741
I guess it's fine, I would say.

24:02.743 --> 24:04.709
- Mommy, do you like your card?

24:04.711 --> 24:05.644
- Are you kidding?

24:05.646 --> 24:06.912
I love this card.

24:06.914 --> 24:08.380
This is, honestly,

24:08.382 --> 24:09.515
I think this might be the
best card you've ever made me.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.383
Look at this, I love it.

24:11.385 --> 24:13.319
- It's you, me, and Daddy.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.788
- Oh, wow, she really
nailed your physique.

24:15.790 --> 24:16.522
- She did.

24:16.524 --> 24:18.157
- Very little neck.

24:18.159 --> 24:19.591
- This one is you,

24:19.593 --> 24:22.461
I put ladybug stickers on
'cause I didn't have lice ones.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.431
- That is horrifying.

24:27.001 --> 24:30.068
Well, this is obviously
going in the keep pile.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.937
She's an evil genius!
