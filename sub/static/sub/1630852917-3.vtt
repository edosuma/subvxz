WEBVTT

00:11.145 --> 00:14.179
KALEB: Got my big,
fat bear rounds here.

00:14.215 --> 00:19.118
220 grains of gristle
and bone smashing lead.

00:23.624 --> 00:29.228
I'm about to face down one of North
America's most dangerous predators, bears.

00:30.497 --> 00:35.267
And if I'm not also a dangerous predator
I have no business being out there.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.908
My goal is to be at the top of
the food chain and to stay there.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.513
(gunshot)

00:53.788 --> 00:55.888
(gunshot)

00:59.060 --> 01:00.592
KALEB: This is
lookin' really good.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.528
I'm on my way out to the
bear hunting grounds.

01:02.930 --> 01:08.600
Just fired off a test shot and
the bullet went where I told it to.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.337
For me, hunting is
not about a trophy.

01:12.339 --> 01:15.874
I do not care about
horn size, hide size,

01:16.944 --> 01:19.211
it's about food for my family.

01:20.014 --> 01:24.749
Hunting black bears in the springtime is
an important source of food for our family.

01:25.886 --> 01:30.489
Black bear is the only species of food
animal that's open in the springtime.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.561
This area here is my
stomping ground as a kid.

01:37.431 --> 01:42.234
The Nizina River is my favorite
spring bear hunting grounds.

01:43.170 --> 01:48.040
This late spring is causing the game to stay
holed-up in the woods later than normal,

01:48.976 --> 01:51.176
which has been
really weird for me.

01:51.178 --> 01:55.347
I'm used to seeing bears this time of
year and to date, I've only seen one.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.719
It's time to go hunting.

02:00.721 --> 02:04.389
Going out bear hunting is like
walking into the lion's den.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.659
I haven't always had a
rosy past with bear hunting,

02:07.661 --> 02:10.929
I've been charged
by grizzlies twice,

02:10.998 --> 02:14.867
once was a mama with a
cub and my gun went click.

02:16.003 --> 02:20.205
When your gun goes click and you're staring
down the barrel at a very angry mama bear,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.743
priorities get
shifted really fast.

02:28.282 --> 02:33.018
CHEVIE: You're out here, you stay
out here mentally until you get home.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.954
It helps protect you
and helps keep you safe

02:35.956 --> 02:37.990
because you never
know what's gonna happen.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.629
(animal call)

02:49.370 --> 02:51.637
CHEVIE: Everything's just
getting up right now.

02:51.655 --> 02:53.438
You know, you know
what papa would say?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.373
SYDNEY: What?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.843
CHEVIE: Know what
papa would say?

02:57.911 --> 02:59.578
SYDNEY: What?

02:59.646 --> 03:02.648
CHEVIE: He'd say, he'd say catch, catch
'em, catch 'em with sleep in their eyes,

03:03.116 --> 03:04.783
they're not quite so fast.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.786
These aren't that long so don't throw
them that far because then they'll,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.388
they'll float out into the river

03:09.456 --> 03:12.791
and we don't wanna have to go get
'em, 'cause they won't touch bottom.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.992
Okay?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.994
They gotta be right
along the edge.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.463
You hear me?
What'd I say?

03:20.601 --> 03:21.867
CHEVIE: Okay, here.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.336
Springtime's kind of an
important time to me, a fun time.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.939
It's kinda the last hunt of the winter
before everything starts nesting and getting

03:27.942 --> 03:30.008
into summertime where we
don't hunt a whole bunch,

03:30.077 --> 03:32.144
so I just felt like
this was the right time

03:32.212 --> 03:35.480
for Sydney to get out
and hunt ducks and geese.

03:37.351 --> 03:40.018
SYDNEY: Right there.
CHEVIE: Huh?

03:40.020 --> 03:42.821
Yeah, that's good, see
how it's not moving?

03:43.490 --> 03:48.159
My goal with Sydney is to teach
her and instill confidence in her.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.429
So she can safely
start handling a firearm.

03:51.432 --> 03:57.703
And for her to be able to be okay with taking
the life of an animal providing food for us.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.171
Okay. I'm gonna, so I put
one in the chamber, okay?

04:00.774 --> 04:03.242
So it's ready to go, all you
have to do is go like that, okay?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.612
So just set it over there.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.249
Take off your earmuffs.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.449
Why do you keep those things on?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.118
You just don't like
listening to me talk or what?

04:15.856 --> 04:18.457
CHEVIE: You gotta put 'em up though so
you can hear what's going on around you.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.344
SYDNEY: Okay.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.080
CHEVIE: Shoot at the
white one in the middle.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.882
Get the gun up
against your shoulder,

04:43.884 --> 04:45.083
just about your practice.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.619
Work on your breathing.

04:47.621 --> 04:52.090
Take your time, if you don't
have a good shot just wait, baby.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.661
Shoot, shoot.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.631
Set it back over there,
they'll come back.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.899
Sit down.

05:12.513 --> 05:16.281
Ooh, right behind it.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.152
That was a good shot.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.291
You're right in it, it doesn't
matter if you get one or not.

05:28.062 --> 05:29.127
CHEVIE: You
almost got that one.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.396
Well, you're gonna
get one eventually.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.498
Good practice.

05:36.803 --> 05:38.203
CHRIS: That's one of the like
benefits of living off the grid,

05:38.205 --> 05:39.537
and living out here.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.406
There's no one around to,
like, point out your mistakes.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.408
You just gotta learn from them.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.610
And as long as we just keep
learning from our mistakes,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.646
we'll be able to stay
out here longer and longer.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.886
How's that lookin'?

05:54.955 --> 05:56.488
Better?

05:56.490 --> 06:00.459
JESSI: I was just thinking about
how large we're gonna want this thing?

06:01.428 --> 06:03.628
CHRIS: Oh, six or
seven feet long?

06:03.630 --> 06:06.097
JESSI: That's what
I was thinking, right?

06:06.300 --> 06:08.834
CHRIS: The first winter out on the
Cosna I pretty much had no veggies,

06:08.902 --> 06:10.034
it was all beans and rice.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.703
All dried foods.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.905
When you're only eating
what you can grow and catch,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.174
having a little
garden's really helpful.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.643
So this year we're gonna build
ourselves an automated garden

06:18.712 --> 06:20.645
that's gonna
actually water itself.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.580
In hopes that we're gonna
have a nice, full garden.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.883
That'll make fall time
a lot easier on us.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.854
What I was thinking is we got these old rain
gutters that are made out of black pipe?

06:29.857 --> 06:32.056
We can kind of turn this
into like, an aqueduct system.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.726
I was thinking maybe have a rain
barrel up here where it's higher?

06:34.728 --> 06:38.196
And then the rain barrel would
feed into another gutter that

06:38.198 --> 06:40.999
would run down to
where the flower box is.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.869
We can have our potatoes
and carrots and lettuce,

06:43.937 --> 06:46.471
and the aqueduct system would
actually water it all summer.

06:47.608 --> 06:51.076
JESSI: Well, I think that it's gonna be
a lot of work but it's gonna be worth it.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.878
A full garden that's
ready to harvest?

06:53.881 --> 06:54.679
It would be.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.880
CHRIS: That would be awesome.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.682
JESSI: That'll be really
important to have out here.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.885
CHRIS: Well, I'll go get the chainsaw mill and
I'll meet you around front if you want to load

06:59.953 --> 07:04.423
that four-foot half cut log up onto the uh
milling table we'll start milling it down.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.159
JESSI: I'll cut up the wood,
you get the chainsaw.

07:08.295 --> 07:13.064
(saw whirring)

07:16.703 --> 07:17.769
You got all four pieces?

07:17.771 --> 07:21.105
CHRIS: Yep. JESSI:
Fantastic. CHRIS: Cool.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.842
JESSI: Head over to
the front of the house.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.845
CHRIS: Yeah, these'll probably
go to the outside like that.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.647
JESSI: Yeah.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.552
I think this should be big enough for
lettuce, bok choy, carrots, and potatoes.

07:34.121 --> 07:34.953
CHRIS: Absolutely.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.125
Perfect, there's your box.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.596
JESSI: Lot of veggies
for us to come back to.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.233
Great, so I think now is
going to be the hardest part.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.869
CHRIS: Making dirt.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.504
JESSI: A lot of dirt.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.142
JOHNNY: No matter where I've
lived, I've always faced challenges.

07:59.012 --> 08:02.347
Challenges that nature throws at me
are challenges that I want to take on.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.557
JOHNNY: We'll get
you some cod, Java.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.158
You don't worry.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.095
Just gonna head up here, it's a
little bit calmer, and do some fishing.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.965
'Cause I don't need to be in
the little rough parts right here.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.102
It's just not worth it.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.606
But getting to the other side of
the bay is a challenging feat in itself.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.109
Gets really choppy, it gets pretty
dangerous in the middle of the day.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.579
Once I get across, I got
a sweet little fishing hole.

08:34.581 --> 08:38.783
I do pretty well there, I catch a
lot of fish but the time is ticking.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.887
Every day in the middle of
the day, that swell picks up.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.190
Made it across
the gauntlet, sweet!

08:45.792 --> 08:50.662
The only problem is the water's a little
bit rougher so we have to pay attention

08:50.730 --> 08:54.399
to the water but
also catch some fish.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.537
I start having too much fun
fishing and my head's down,

08:58.605 --> 09:00.872
and then I look up and there's
all this swell going on and

09:00.941 --> 09:05.476
it will swamp my boat
'cause that swell comes in fast.

09:05.479 --> 09:09.013
So the goal is to catch a bunch of
cod and the cod are going to feed Java.

09:09.016 --> 09:13.618
You know, I consider myself
a subsistence hunter, gatherer,

09:14.154 --> 09:18.156
and Java's kinda more of
a subsistence freeloader but

09:18.158 --> 09:20.825
it's all good because she keeps
me company while I'm doing all this

09:20.894 --> 09:22.694
stuff out here.

09:22.762 --> 09:26.431
I eat a subsistence diet,
I don't buy any meat whatsoever

09:26.433 --> 09:29.768
and there's no reason why my
dog can't live that same life.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.837
Going across the bay to
catch fish, it's just an errand.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.040
This is me running errands.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.643
You learn to be creative,
and catch fish!

09:39.713 --> 09:40.845
There we go, got one on!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.448
Yeah, baby.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.716
This one's got a
little more fight.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.218
See what we got.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.322
Oh, Irish lord.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.992
I don't keep the Irish lords.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.661
And if I don't keep fish I
don't bring 'em out of the water.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.064
I try to keep 'em in
as much as possible,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.935
but you don't want to get
pricked by their little fins

10:03.937 --> 10:07.872
and such because you can
get a pretty nasty infection.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.076
And down he goes.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.280
Don't bring 'em out of the
water because what's the point?

10:15.348 --> 10:17.983
You know I want
the fish to live.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.822
You're like a person,
sitting there.

10:23.890 --> 10:24.889
Oh, there we go.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.092
That's a fish.

10:27.894 --> 10:28.960
Come on, baby.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.561
What do we got?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.964
Ah, another Irish lord.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.033
Calm down, calm down.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.802
I don't want to
be pricked by you.

10:39.706 --> 10:43.241
If I'm catching two of the Irish
lords in this area then that means

10:43.309 --> 10:45.443
it's not the place I wanna be.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.512
Move on.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.783
Yeah, this is what it is to
live the subsistence life.

10:52.252 --> 10:56.387
You know, it's adventurous, it's fun,
it's a way to get out and see the world,

10:56.856 --> 10:59.157
see life through a
different set of lenses.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.229
Ooh, that's a big swell.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.932
I'm drifting hard.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.035
I'm gonna put my
boat underwater.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.610
I'm drifting pretty hard,

11:20.163 --> 11:23.414
and I'm just catching fish
that I'm not trying to catch so.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.419
The water's channeling between this
big rock here and this point right here,

11:28.488 --> 11:32.891
and it's a tight little squeeze so the water
flowing in between them is creating more of a wake,

11:33.560 --> 11:37.228
creating bigger swell and I
can't fish in something like this,

11:38.231 --> 11:40.231
because it's just
a little too bumpy.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.366
It's just not worth it.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.969
You know, nature doesn't care
if I'm catching fish or not,

11:45.038 --> 11:48.439
so sometimes I'm out here and
the waves pick up and I gotta go.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.041
We'll get you some cod, Java.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.810
You don't worry.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.481
CHEVIE: Going out, being
on the land, being opportunists.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.116
It's really hard.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.784
There's a lot to it.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.556
You gotta be ready to be able to rise to
that occasion and perform and to not crumble.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.328
CHEVIE: If that was a beaver this morning
and you were that close to a beaver.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.465
And that duck, when you shot
at that duck you would have,

12:13.533 --> 12:15.600
you would have hit,
you would have hit that beaver.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.268
That was a beaver
killing shot, right there.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.004
But that was such, that was just a
little pocket duck you were shooting at.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.409
No matter what you just can't
let your confidence get shaken.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.279
All right, let's do it, let's try to get
some, let's try to get some ducks.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.614
SYDNEY: Okay.

12:30.150 --> 12:35.953
CHEVIE: There's a lot of tools and a lot
of positive things that come out of being

12:35.956 --> 12:39.157
in the forest
or being on the land.

12:39.225 --> 12:43.428
I just wanted her to actually kill
an animal, to take that first shot,

12:43.496 --> 12:49.134
get a taste of subsistence lifestyle
and focus on her and her development.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.970
All right, we got some, usually,

12:52.973 --> 12:55.306
we got some ducks that are
right here sittin' around the corner,

12:55.308 --> 12:56.775
let's be ready for 'em okay?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.510
SYDNEY: Okay.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.779
CHEVIE: We'll just kinda go slow and
see if we see some ducks back in the trees.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.581
SYDNEY: Okay.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.249
CHEVIE: Do you want me to shoot at the ones
that fly or you want me to let them go?

13:05.252 --> 13:08.719
SYDNEY: Um, I think you shoot at
the ones that fly because I'm not very

13:08.722 --> 13:10.188
good at flying things.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.990
CHEVIE: Okay.

13:14.728 --> 13:17.729
Okay, right out your side right here
there's one little pocket duck swimmin'.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.198
I'll tell you
where it's at, okay?

13:20.266 --> 13:23.668
You see it? It's right on the other
side of this log, it's almost to the bank.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.806
SYDNEY: Here? Dang
it. CHEVIE: That's okay.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.741
SYDNEY: Oh, really.

13:30.744 --> 13:34.612
CHEVIE: Animals gotta win, win, win
sometimes, too, and get away sometimes

13:34.681 --> 13:35.880
and that's, that's fine.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.615
That's just the way it is.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.717
Should we go to the next spot?

13:41.354 --> 13:44.422
All right, Sydney I see quite a
few ducks right up here still so,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.691
be ready with your .22.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.093
Stay down.
Stay down.

13:52.766 --> 13:54.866
(gunshot)

13:55.435 --> 13:57.902
SYDNEY: Flew away?

13:57.971 --> 14:00.371
CHEVIE: It's right
here on the bank.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.374
Get it, Thor.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.177
I just knocked one out of the air
and then it was right here on the bank,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.146
just winged it.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.513
It was a big mallard.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.781
SYDNEY: Wait.

14:10.784 --> 14:12.183
What, what do you mean you
knocked it out of the air Dad?

14:12.202 --> 14:13.985
CHEVIE: And I don't know if
it went back in the water or if it,

14:13.987 --> 14:18.089
they'll get in the grass up here and
they'll kinda, they'll kind of run around.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.592
Okay.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.126
SYDNEY: All the way over here?

14:22.128 --> 14:24.529
CHEVIE: It ran up the bank,
somewhere in here.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.465
SYDNEY: Oh, maybe it flew away.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.733
CHEVIE: It might've.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.769
It was going pretty darn good.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.406
SYDNEY: I have a feeling
it's long gone by now.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.676
CHEVIE: It might be.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.347
SYDNEY: We just lost it.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.582
CHEVIE: Could be in the water,
we gotta look.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.119
SYDNEY: We already did look.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.223
CHEVIE: Day's not
over yet though, okay?

14:52.292 --> 14:53.625
SYDNEY: Uh-hmm.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.093
CHEVIE: Been out quite a while,

14:55.161 --> 14:57.828
getting a little
bit tired and, uh,

14:57.831 --> 15:00.031
knocked one duck out of the
air and couldn't find it.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.599
Sydney was kinda
bummed out about it,

15:01.635 --> 15:04.168
because we've been waiting to get
a duck in the boat for a couple hours

15:04.170 --> 15:08.373
this morning and it's really good
for her little spirit to keep her excited

15:08.441 --> 15:09.974
and boosted about
what we're doing here.

15:09.976 --> 15:14.979
So we gotta shoot some ducks
and we gotta keep everybody happy.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.656
KALEB: It is very important to train, to
prepare, and be the most dangerous predator

15:24.925 --> 15:28.459
in the woods when going
out on a black bear hunt.

15:29.395 --> 15:30.795
Otherwise, I won't survive.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.263
I won't come home.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.102
Big ol' wolf, two of 'em
walked through here a day ago.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.206
And I see old bear
tracks in the mud.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.676
So that's a good sign.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.079
Bears are
traveling through here.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.884
This has been a
very strange spring.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.755
There are no bears out
when they normally are.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.491
I'm struggling to
just see one bear.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.566
I think I got one.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.703
Yep, that black
bear right there.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.637
It's about 400 yards
away right now.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.908
And now, we've gotta close that
gap a lot, getting up on that point.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.979
I should have a nice clear line
of sign right down into his vitals,

16:22.515 --> 16:26.384
just need to get in brush,
out of sight before he spooks.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.588
We're on the hunt now, boys.

16:31.124 --> 16:35.326
Wintertime is long and it's cold and
there's not really any sources of meat

16:35.328 --> 16:38.062
out here other than
what we get in the fall.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.666
And last fall we didn't do
so hot during hunting season

16:41.734 --> 16:44.769
so we are in desperate
need of more meat.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.351
He's down there.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.154
Looking straight at me.

17:03.156 --> 17:06.357
It's a cinnamon-faced
black bear down there.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.993
Nice looking, good-sized bear.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.861
(gunshot)

17:26.863 --> 17:29.230
KALEB: Bear is down!

17:31.134 --> 17:33.601
He's still going a little bit.

17:35.538 --> 17:37.538
(gunshot)

17:40.210 --> 17:44.212
Unfortunately for whatever
reason, uh my shot wasn't perfect,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.681
and now I've gotta
go finish the situation.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.251
So we need to get down
there before he runs too far,

17:51.487 --> 17:54.221
and before his trail disappears.

17:54.824 --> 17:58.359
For me, this is a
horrendous situation,

17:58.428 --> 18:00.828
one of which I am not proud of.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.297
I keep in the back of my mind
that I've got a dangerous

18:03.299 --> 18:06.567
predator on the
loose in front of me.

18:06.903 --> 18:12.173
I am prepared at any given
moment to face down a charging bear.

18:13.977 --> 18:16.710
There's a lot of
blood right there.

18:17.380 --> 18:20.448
I got blood here,
big running paw prints.

18:21.918 --> 18:25.653
We're closing in on him, I hope
to find him dead somewhere.

18:26.790 --> 18:30.691
That's my goal.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.670
Hold it.

18:46.476 --> 18:49.093
I heard something go, whomp.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.494
This is not good.

19:14.370 --> 19:18.105
I'm going to wait 'till tomorrow
because this bear might be,

19:18.107 --> 19:21.108
uh, agitated, dangerous.

19:21.177 --> 19:24.979
I heard him walking above
me but not running,

19:24.981 --> 19:27.915
not acting scared,
just walking through the

19:27.917 --> 19:31.452
woods like nothing
ever happened.

19:31.454 --> 19:35.456
And, uh, so I'm
thinking it might be best

19:35.458 --> 19:39.093
to just back out,
come back, look tomorrow.

19:42.532 --> 19:45.800
I am hearing this bear
on the slopes above me.

19:45.868 --> 19:48.602
This means the
tables have turned.

19:48.605 --> 19:53.274
This bear is hunting me, and I need
to get out of this situation immediately.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.349
JESSI: Cosna doesn't have
bad days or good days.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.483
It's just the Cosna.

20:02.552 --> 20:04.752
It's me having the
bad or good days.

20:04.820 --> 20:07.889
All of that knowledge and the
perseverance is what is going to

20:07.957 --> 20:10.191
get us through
all these obstacles.

20:26.109 --> 20:32.112
JESSI: Nice.
Move that over, maybe.

20:32.782 --> 20:36.284
CHRIS: I think that this is some
really good rot log right here.

20:37.119 --> 20:38.920
Check this out.

20:39.188 --> 20:40.855
JESSI: Whew, look
how wet that is.

20:40.923 --> 20:42.323
CHRIS: Yeah, I don't even
think we'll have to pick that out.

20:42.391 --> 20:44.292
It's just gonna
come right on out.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.262
This is gonna hold in the moisture
really well to our garden box.

20:49.065 --> 20:50.130
JESSI: Perfect base layer.

20:50.133 --> 20:52.199
CHRIS: Yeah.
It's exactly what we want.

20:55.538 --> 20:58.673
JESSI: Ground here
is very clay-like, and

20:58.741 --> 21:02.209
that means it's not super conducive
for root-growing vegetables.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.879
CHRIS: You're
running out of rot.

21:04.947 --> 21:07.481
JESSI: Out of log up here.

21:07.550 --> 21:10.885
So we're gonna have to go look
around and find all of the ingredients.

21:10.953 --> 21:11.885
CHRIS: All right.

21:11.888 --> 21:13.754
JESSI: That it
takes to make dirt.

21:14.223 --> 21:16.857
It's like making a cake out
here, but for my plants.

21:18.428 --> 21:19.293
Okay.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.028
CHRIS: And dump.

21:21.097 --> 21:25.866
JESSI: Great. Wow.
That worked fabulously.

21:27.103 --> 21:30.037
All right, let's go,
uh, get the rest of that

21:30.039 --> 21:33.574
sod dirt and start
mixing in some other stuff.

21:33.643 --> 21:34.975
CHRIS: Perfect.

21:35.845 --> 21:38.980
JESSI: The entire roof of
this cabin used to be sod.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.517
CHRIS: It's just
chopping up so nice.

21:43.586 --> 21:45.019
Look at that.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.655
JESSI: Sod is a great
insulating layer.

21:47.657 --> 21:49.256
CHRIS: Nice.

21:49.258 --> 21:52.193
JESSI: And there's a lot that's still
laying on the backside of the house.

21:53.463 --> 21:55.062
Really that does
look pretty nice.

21:55.131 --> 21:56.731
CHRIS: Yeah, feel it.

21:56.799 --> 21:58.999
That is like, really
good-looking dirt.

21:59.002 --> 22:01.535
JESSI: Ooh.
It's so fluffy.

22:01.604 --> 22:03.004
CHRIS: I know because I'm
just chopping it all up.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.640
JESSI: This is way better than
I thought it was going to be.

22:08.478 --> 22:10.511
CHRIS: Lift
your weight, Cletus.

22:11.614 --> 22:12.680
Let's go.

22:12.682 --> 22:15.049
JESSI: Let me grab the
bottom, great and over.

22:17.820 --> 22:19.887
CHRIS: Got the sand.

22:20.089 --> 22:24.058
Maybe a little bit of ash,
and then we can plant.

22:25.361 --> 22:27.628
All right, this is
looking really good.

22:27.630 --> 22:30.698
All we gotta figure out next
is how to get water back here.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.567
JESSI: Yeah, I think that's
gonna be quite the chore.

22:35.772 --> 22:39.974
CHEVIE: You're not born with
the instincts to survive in Alaska.

22:40.376 --> 22:41.509
Those are learned.

22:41.577 --> 22:44.378
You need to remain calm and
you need to be prepared.

22:44.380 --> 22:47.982
There's a lot of work that goes into being
successful no matter what you're doing.

22:50.986 --> 22:53.253
CHEVIE: I'm gonna throw
this stick out there, okay?

22:53.256 --> 22:56.390
And then while it's moving
down the river I want you to try to

22:56.459 --> 22:59.760
follow it with your shotgun
and shoot it, okay?

23:01.597 --> 23:03.297
SYDNEY: Okay.

23:04.533 --> 23:06.801
CHEVIE: Spread your legs
out wide, there you go.

23:06.869 --> 23:09.203
SYDNEY: I, I, I'm really
not looking forward to this.

23:09.271 --> 23:11.238
CHEVIE: You're okay.

23:11.674 --> 23:12.540
(gunshot)

23:12.608 --> 23:13.941
Whoa, good one!

23:13.943 --> 23:14.942
SYDNEY: Was that a dead duck?

23:14.944 --> 23:18.145
CHEVIE: Dead duck!
SYDNEY: Yes, yes, yes.

23:19.081 --> 23:22.149
CHEVIE: Could still just be my hunting
partner and help grab birds if we get some

23:22.151 --> 23:23.484
or whatever, you know?

23:23.486 --> 23:25.352
SYDNEY: Okay.
CHEVIE: All right.

23:25.354 --> 23:28.222
I mean, let's pack our stuff
up and head to the boat.

23:28.958 --> 23:31.025
Sydney was practicing
with the .22

23:31.093 --> 23:34.495
and now that we're shooting some
waterfowl she's stepped her game up to a

23:34.497 --> 23:38.432
.410 which actually has a little
bit of kick to it and it's a bigger gun.

23:38.434 --> 23:41.902
It's a really big accomplishment for her to
be able to start using some guns like this.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.840
You're really starting to help a
lot around the boat, aren't you?

23:45.908 --> 23:50.110
SYDNEY: Uh-hmm. Okay.

23:50.579 --> 23:54.181
CHEVIE: Now I'm excited about
bringing you even more.

23:55.585 --> 23:58.452
It's been a learning
experience for the both of us.

23:58.454 --> 24:02.990
I'm, I'm learning how to be
a better teacher and patient,

24:03.058 --> 24:06.327
and Sydney and I have just
had a great time together.

24:06.395 --> 24:10.965
So we're gonna give her one
last try here before we go home.

24:20.610 --> 24:22.143
So make sure you're
looking around.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.345
SYDNEY: Okay.

24:32.355 --> 24:32.937
(gunshot)

24:38.410 --> 24:39.944
SYDNEY: Hey, we got one!

24:40.012 --> 24:42.813
CHEVIE: Okay, get your, get your
net, or be ready to pick it up, okay Bean?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.281
This one's all you.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.584
Grab it, Sydney. Grab it.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.353
SYDNEY: It's too far away.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.355
Let's try again.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.157
Not so fast.

24:53.826 --> 24:57.094
I got it.
I got it, Dad.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.095
CHEVIE: Good grab!

24:58.163 --> 25:01.431
(panting)

25:01.434 --> 25:04.235
Okay, bring it in the boat.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.437
SYDNEY: It's alive.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.344
(gunshot)

25:14.780 --> 25:16.313
SYDNEY: We got it.

25:16.582 --> 25:18.482
You ran it over!

25:19.118 --> 25:20.117
Is it alive?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.452
CHEVIE: Yeah. It's alive.
Grab it by the neck.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.988
SYDNEY: Okay.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.590
(gunshot)

25:26.592 --> 25:32.930
SYDNEY: We got it.

25:32.932 --> 25:34.331
No Thor, get.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.201
CHEVIE: If I'm successful,
Sydney's successful.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.569
She's a team player.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.872
The ultimate goal is to
put animals into the boat,

25:41.874 --> 25:45.476
and she was just as happy scooping
them out of the water with the net,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.545
and that being her part.

25:47.613 --> 25:51.548
That was just as much of a success
to her as maybe shooting a duck.

25:52.017 --> 25:55.352
There's so many things that go
along with being a good hunting partner

25:55.354 --> 25:57.021
or being a
partner when you're out.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.090
And I feel like I, I
have that with Sydney.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.494
Good, Sydney?
That feels good, huh?

26:03.562 --> 26:07.097
SYDNEY: Yeah, way better.
CHEVIE: Way better.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.434
River girl.
River girl.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.907
JOHNNY: I'm not bringing
food down from the Arctic.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.776
When I get to a location,
I find new resources.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.712
And that's part of the
subsistence lifestyle.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.081
The resources move, and so do I.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.260
JOHNNY: All right Java, you ready
to catch some fish or what, dude?

26:37.730 --> 26:40.597
We gotta do better
than yesterday.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.000
What do you think
of this lure, Java?

26:43.068 --> 26:44.534
Wanna give him some good luck?

26:44.537 --> 26:45.869
I'll let you give
it some good luck.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.271
There we go.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.207
See what we got going on here.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.444
Here in south-central
Alaska, I have oceans.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.947
I have a lot of fishing
to take advantage of.

26:57.016 --> 27:02.119
This place is just very abundant
with resources if you can find it.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.224
Gotta keep a eye on the horizon,

27:07.226 --> 27:10.227
make sure that the
swells aren't getting too big,

27:10.229 --> 27:14.398
but every day in the middle of
the day that swell picks up.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.739
Oh, that's a fish already.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.742
Oh God, it's got some fight!

27:25.645 --> 27:27.878
It pulling me in circles.

27:29.915 --> 27:32.082
I'm gonna need a
net for this one.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.986
Halibut.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.988
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.823
(Bleep).

27:41.326 --> 27:43.227
Look at that.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.130
You like that, Java?

27:46.399 --> 27:48.198
Cool.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.466
Got a halibut here.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.601
That was pretty fast.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.004
That was a nice,
pleasant surprise.

27:54.073 --> 27:58.409
Fishing for a cod for my dog
and now I have food for myself.

27:59.879 --> 28:00.744
Halibut's for me.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.146
That's not for you, dude.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.348
That's too good, huh?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.283
You can have the head.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.419
I think I got something.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.154
Feelin' a little heavy.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.354
Yep.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.891
You interested in
some salad, ma'am?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.627
Yeah, I didn't
think so, me either.

28:17.630 --> 28:23.834
Looks like the tide's kind of
shifting and the water looks like it

28:23.902 --> 28:26.003
might get a little bit rougher,

28:26.839 --> 28:28.906
which means it's
time for me to bail.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.374
I don't wanna push
my luck out here,

28:31.377 --> 28:35.212
so I'm gonna head back while
I can before it gets too nasty.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.249
I hope it's not too late
in the season for cod.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.518
I might be a little late.

28:42.838 --> 28:46.590
KALEB: Heading out on hunts by myself
helps me to be a more efficient hunter

28:46.859 --> 28:48.525
because I can be quieter.

28:48.594 --> 28:53.864
I can be a shadow in the
woods, and it improves my odds of

28:53.866 --> 28:57.334
bringing back my intended
target dramatically.

29:06.011 --> 29:12.116
KALEB: I shot a bear up on the slope above me
here and made a less-than-ideal shot on it.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.618
And now I need to track
it through the woods,

29:14.620 --> 29:18.088
need to get back to my
last-known location,

29:18.157 --> 29:21.525
and start tracking him through the
brush and see if I can't find anything.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.628
I don't know where this bear is.

29:24.696 --> 29:25.695
It could be anywhere.

29:25.698 --> 29:28.232
It could be hiding at
the base of a tree,

29:28.300 --> 29:31.135
waiting for me to walk by,
and jump out and get me.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.072
It's not okay to leave an animal
to just suffer in the forest.

29:36.842 --> 29:43.280
So, I'm going to do my absolute
best to find this bear and harvest it.

29:43.649 --> 29:46.250
To put it on my
table, to eat it.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.720
There are some
tracks right there.

29:50.723 --> 29:53.690
He's turned and he's going out
towards the, towards the river.

29:55.928 --> 30:01.832
And so, I have to be extremely tuned in to
every little disturbance on the forest floor

30:03.135 --> 30:06.336
that gives me a signal that
something passed through here.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.140
I will not stop trying
until I find this bear.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.011
Here's a soft track right
here in this ant farm.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.980
Ants have already pretty much
destroyed with their work.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.419
Here's a twig that
the bear broke off.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.754
It's a sign of his passing.

30:24.757 --> 30:27.024
So, he went right through here.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.174
Oh, I just spotted it.

30:49.731 --> 30:52.933
KALEB: This bear died at the
base of that tree right there.

30:53.736 --> 30:57.404
I don't think he's moving,
but he was going right here.

30:58.207 --> 30:59.740
And he circled around,

30:59.808 --> 31:02.876
and he was posted up at the base
of that tree waiting for me to come by.

31:04.013 --> 31:06.613
Makes me very glad that
I backed out when I did.

31:07.416 --> 31:10.684
'Cause he would have charged from 15 feet
away and that would've been the end of me.

31:11.486 --> 31:13.720
I'm gonna sneak up and
make sure it's dead.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.026
Bear is dead.

31:20.696 --> 31:23.764
Wow, thank goodness I found it.

31:25.167 --> 31:27.834
Nice little cinnamon bear.

31:28.170 --> 31:30.837
Sorry bear to have
caused you this pain.

31:30.839 --> 31:34.208
My shot placement was not
what it should have been.

31:35.978 --> 31:39.546
I always intend when I pull the trigger
for the animal to drop in its tracks.

31:40.849 --> 31:42.883
You'll be good on
my table though.

31:45.321 --> 31:51.992
I'm very glad that I put in the work to find
this bear and now it's time to butcher him,

31:53.195 --> 31:56.463
skin him down, break him into
quarters, throw him in my backpack.

31:58.734 --> 32:04.137
This meat here represents a lot of
hard work, a lot of effort went into this.

32:05.207 --> 32:08.809
But I'm very thankful for this
bear and the food that he

32:08.877 --> 32:11.178
provides for my family
for the summer.

32:13.882 --> 32:16.483
While I love the process,
I'm glad it's done.

32:17.486 --> 32:22.822
There's nothing left now but to load up
camp after I enjoy the fruits of my labor.

32:23.826 --> 32:27.361
You are what you eat, so
today I am a cinnamon bear.

32:30.232 --> 32:32.832
Mm, this bear is amazing.

32:32.835 --> 32:34.901
Tastes like a lot of hard work,

32:34.970 --> 32:39.640
a lot of miles traveled,
pounds carried,

32:41.176 --> 32:43.643
and it's delicious.

32:44.780 --> 32:49.750
I'm getting a quick snack here, and
then pack up and head home to my family.

32:52.921 --> 32:56.556
And, uh, turn this bear into burger
and sausage, and other delicious things.

32:59.261 --> 33:01.261
CHRIS: Generally speaking,
it's a tough life out here.

33:01.330 --> 33:03.596
It's hard to carve
yourself a lifestyle.

33:03.599 --> 33:06.833
You're just always moving forward
and always learning from your mistakes.

33:13.008 --> 33:15.342
CHRIS: I thought we'd gather
up all this PVC pipe we got here.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.609
JESSI: Yeah.

33:16.612 --> 33:18.278
CHRIS: I tried making an old
water system out of this.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.746
It should work really good.

33:19.815 --> 33:21.348
This is for the old water pump.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.416
This is like a
big one-way valve.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.619
I think we can take
this along with us.

33:25.687 --> 33:27.220
JESSI: Okay.

33:27.289 --> 33:29.489
CHRIS: And then I figured we'll
take like, uh, one of our old fuel drums,

33:29.491 --> 33:31.825
and then we'll cut a hole in
the top and make a rain barrel.

33:32.027 --> 33:33.493
JESSI: Alright.

33:33.495 --> 33:34.828
CHRIS: Do you think you can
pick this up and I'll get the big drum?

33:34.830 --> 33:36.697
JESSI: Yeah.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.498
CHRIS: So, there's a couple
ways that we get water out here, uh,

33:38.567 --> 33:40.901
rain is like the best
drinking water out here.

33:40.969 --> 33:44.237
Uh, we got a really big roof
that's, uh, pitched mostly one side.

33:44.306 --> 33:46.573
Uh, so every time it rains
for more than a few minutes,

33:46.641 --> 33:48.441
we get about 50 gallons
of rainwater.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.644
If we can set up a
rain-catching system,

33:50.712 --> 33:52.579
uh, we'll be catching
water all summer long and

33:52.647 --> 33:53.880
we'll be able to
water our garden.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.919
So, I think the rain barrel
should go right here,

33:58.987 --> 34:01.254
and I'm just gonna end up
like cutting a hole in it,

34:01.323 --> 34:04.924
so when we make the rain gutters
come down, they'll fall right into this.

34:04.927 --> 34:06.059
JESSI: Great.
CHRIS: Cool.

34:06.061 --> 34:08.095
Let's start by cutting
one of these in half.

34:13.869 --> 34:16.069
Like that.

34:16.071 --> 34:18.572
Let's test it out.

34:20.409 --> 34:22.876
JESSI: Oh, yes.

34:23.345 --> 34:25.946
CHRIS: Once we get it attached
it'll all work better. Okay.

34:26.681 --> 34:28.548
As the rain comes down
and lands on our tin roof,

34:28.617 --> 34:30.550
it drops into our
double gutter system,

34:30.552 --> 34:32.152
which drops into a sink,

34:32.220 --> 34:34.554
which drops into
our 55-gallon drum,

34:34.556 --> 34:36.223
comes up on a solar power pump,

34:36.291 --> 34:37.691
lands into our
gravity-fed trough,

34:37.759 --> 34:40.827
drops down a couple layers,
pops over a half-pipe,

34:40.896 --> 34:44.030
drops into a splitter which goes
down two troughs into our garden,

34:44.566 --> 34:48.034
and everything goes perfectly, we're gonna
have a beautiful garden come fall time.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.036
Nice and tight.
Alright, let's drop it in.

34:52.574 --> 34:54.307
JESSI: Perfect.

34:54.309 --> 34:56.176
CHRIS: Well, you
ready to try it out?

34:56.178 --> 34:57.243
JESSI: Yeah, let's do it.

34:57.246 --> 34:58.712
Let me put some water.
Oh wait, I don't have to.

34:58.780 --> 34:59.779
You're just gonna hit the pump.

34:59.782 --> 35:01.514
That's right.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.884
CHRIS: All we gotta do is hit this button
and we're pretending to be the timer.

35:07.122 --> 35:07.987
Power's up.

35:07.990 --> 35:09.856
JESSI: Oh!

35:11.460 --> 35:14.260
There it goes.

35:14.263 --> 35:17.130
It's going down one
trough, into the other.

35:18.266 --> 35:19.599
CHRIS: All the way down.

35:19.668 --> 35:21.168
Awesome.
Works great.

35:22.004 --> 35:23.470
Give me one of these.

35:23.472 --> 35:24.604
JESSI: So, like
everything works.

35:24.606 --> 35:26.473
CHRIS: Yeah.
JESSI: Like it, wow.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.609
Morse homestead.
Getting the garden put in.

35:29.678 --> 35:31.744
CHRIS: An automated
garden on the homestead.

35:31.747 --> 35:33.146
Who woulda thought?

35:33.215 --> 35:35.882
JESSI: So, all that's next
is to put the garden in, right?

35:35.884 --> 35:37.350
CHRIS: Oh, that's exciting.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.352
JESSI: I know I'm gonna go get
my little planties and my little seeds,

35:40.088 --> 35:41.621
and we're gonna fill
up the garden, right?

35:41.623 --> 35:42.889
CHRIS: That's it.
JESSI: Awesome.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.558
This is my favorite part.

35:47.762 --> 35:50.764
JOHNNY: It's not
an easy lifestyle.

35:50.832 --> 35:52.832
Nature's doing its thing
with or without me.

35:52.835 --> 35:55.568
And I intentionally subject
myself to these challenges,

35:55.571 --> 35:57.771
to these hardships,
because that's what I enjoy.

36:00.776 --> 36:04.344
It's a damn-fine day for fishing,
we'll find you some fish, Java.

36:06.315 --> 36:07.113
The weather's nice.

36:07.182 --> 36:08.047
It's nice and calm.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.182
There's no swell.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.184
And this is a day I can
take advantage of fishing,

36:11.253 --> 36:13.987
and I gotta figure out
where the schools of cod are.

36:14.323 --> 36:15.522
You know,
if I'm not catching fish,

36:15.590 --> 36:17.791
if I'm not bringing food
home for her then she'll be

36:17.859 --> 36:19.592
stuck eating kibble.

36:19.595 --> 36:23.663
But the more I catch, uh, the
longer it's gonna feed her and, uh,

36:23.665 --> 36:27.200
and that's just that much longer I
can go without coming back out here

36:27.269 --> 36:29.402
and dealing with
crossing the bay.

36:29.471 --> 36:30.537
Oh, man.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.439
I'm feeling some
fish down there.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.277
This one's got
some weight to it.

36:38.747 --> 36:40.213
There we go.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.982
Irish lord.

36:43.818 --> 36:46.119
I don't keep 'em.

36:48.824 --> 36:50.824
Calm down, buddy.

36:56.364 --> 36:57.830
What do you think, Java?

36:57.833 --> 36:59.366
I think it's time to
give this spot a rest.

36:59.434 --> 37:02.102
Don't you, girl?

37:04.906 --> 37:09.642
I'm gonna migrate another 30 yards
over to here, and I think that because

37:09.645 --> 37:11.911
I'm close to
those big rock cliffs,

37:11.914 --> 37:16.516
you know I'm kind of looking for more of
like a sandy, muddy bottom to catch cod,

37:16.585 --> 37:21.187
so, so I'm going to putt up a little
bit, get back to the fishing grounds.

37:24.326 --> 37:26.593
Where those cod at, Java?

37:26.929 --> 37:29.929
And this particular day,
it's been a little bit slow.

37:29.932 --> 37:32.865
I'm catching Irish lords but
I'm not catching the cod.

37:33.068 --> 37:35.902
Uh, but that's okay, you just
keep trying, keep at it, and, uh,

37:36.605 --> 37:38.405
persistence will pay off.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.776
Let's see what we
got going on here.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.545
Yeah, baby.

37:45.948 --> 37:47.280
That's a fish on, baby.

37:47.749 --> 37:49.949
Come on, be a cod.
Be a cod.

37:50.418 --> 37:53.887
We're about to find out
Java if you're gonna be eatin'

37:53.955 --> 37:55.855
or I'm gonna be sending
an Irish lord back down.

38:02.748 --> 38:06.149
JOHNNY: Come on, be a cod.
Be a cod.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.487
Cod!

38:11.690 --> 38:13.290
We'll take it.

38:13.358 --> 38:14.757
Oh, yeah.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.793
In the bucket, he goes.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.164
What do you say, Javs?

38:21.166 --> 38:22.432
Is this good enough for you?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.434
Am I doing okay?

38:24.436 --> 38:27.704
Oh, but when the biting's good,
sometimes I push my luck.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.707
These are the cod
I'm after right here.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.878
That's what I'm looking for.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.447
Oh, yeah.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.648
Possibly a halibut.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.117
Whatever it is,
it's got a fight to it.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.320
That's what I'm
after right there.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.423
That's a nice cod.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.327
Java, you're eating
good for a while buddy.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.196
I'm on top of a nice
school of cod right now.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.498
I'm pulling them up
kind of left and right.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.068
And this is what I'm after.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.470
This is what I've been
trying to find is the school.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.405
That's what gonna fill
this bucket full of fish,

39:02.474 --> 39:04.474
and that's what's
gonna fill my dry rack

39:04.476 --> 39:06.943
full of cod and that's
what's gonna feed Java.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.145
Another cod, I'll take it.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.949
Here we go.
We'll take 'em.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.819
It's a nice cod.

39:17.422 --> 39:19.556
That's what I'm
after right there.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.993
We'll keep 'em.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.696
Another cod.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.099
You're just unfazed by this.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.168
You don't care unless
it's time to eat.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.971
But at this point,
I got a pretty good amount.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.307
I got about two weeks' worth.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.577
I wanna cross the bay
before it gets too rough.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.914
To be able to live a lifestyle
that I can connect with nature,

39:45.717 --> 39:49.586
have this symbiotic
relationship with,

39:49.654 --> 39:52.321
it's just a really
beautiful thing for me.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.924
And I don't take it for
granted, not one day.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.797
CHEVIE: Thanks Sydney.
SYDNEY: Welcome.

40:00.865 --> 40:02.599
CHEVIE: Which duck is this?
Do you remember?

40:02.667 --> 40:04.467
SYDNEY: Uh, pintail?

40:04.469 --> 40:05.935
CHEVIE: Oh, yeah. Probably.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.104
RYDER: Thank you.

40:08.140 --> 40:12.142
CHEVIE: There's a lot more than just hunting
or just going out and getting an animal.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.745
There's a lot of things you
can learn while you're doing it.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.148
With Sydney, she really developed as
a young steward of the land so to speak.

40:19.484 --> 40:21.084
You know she's,
that's who she is.

40:21.152 --> 40:24.888
She's, she's developed more and become
more comfortable in her surroundings.

40:26.558 --> 40:30.226
I, I'm excited about the years to
come and all the fun memories

40:30.495 --> 40:32.929
that we'll make that
started with this trip.

40:33.698 --> 40:34.697
Pretty good Sydney?

40:34.766 --> 40:35.565
SYDNEY: Yeah.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.499
CHEVIE: I'm gonna have some.

40:36.501 --> 40:37.767
SONTA: Good job, Bean.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.302
SYDNEY: Thank you.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.037
CHEVIE: You probably scooped
this one out of the water I'd imagine.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.705
SYDNEY: Why?
CHEVIE: I don't know.

40:42.774 --> 40:43.907
You scooped a lot
out of the water,

40:43.975 --> 40:45.975
so there's a pretty good
chance you scooped this one.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.310
SYDNEY: I think it might be.

40:47.312 --> 40:49.579
I think it might be that some
of these birds like I brought in,

40:49.647 --> 40:51.047
or I helped you get.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.949
CHEVIE: That's pretty cool, huh?
SYDNEY: Uh-huh.

40:54.519 --> 40:59.055
CHEVIE: I think the big takeaway is
to make the time for your kids to have

40:59.057 --> 41:02.191
moments like this 'cause they're
only gonna be that age once.

41:03.394 --> 41:08.298
We get busy and life happens so
fast that sometimes we don't slow down,

41:09.534 --> 41:13.135
and it's just a reminder to take
those times, those weekends,

41:13.472 --> 41:16.672
those four or five days and
really get to know your kids.

41:17.342 --> 41:20.142
You can always look back
and say I wish I would've

41:20.145 --> 41:23.813
but it's really nice to be able
to say that's what we did.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.822
BRITTANY: Hey.
KALEB: Hey.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.757
BRITTANY: Were you successful?

41:34.759 --> 41:37.227
KALEB: Yeah, look at
that full backpack.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.361
BRITTANY: You know what
you brought with you.

41:38.429 --> 41:39.896
KALEB: Full of meat.

41:39.964 --> 41:42.232
BRITTANY: That's a small
bear if it all fits in there.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.700
KALEB: Yeah, well
it's springtime.

41:43.768 --> 41:46.302
They're not exactly the largest
creatures this time of the year.

41:46.638 --> 41:47.770
BRITTANY: That's true.

41:47.772 --> 41:50.640
I guess we need to
go process some meat.

41:50.708 --> 41:51.908
KALEB: For sure.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.176
BRITTANY: Do that.
We missed you.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.511
KALEB: I'm glad to be back
too when that bear was.

41:55.514 --> 41:56.779
BRITTANY: I bet you're whipped.

41:56.781 --> 41:58.515
KALEB: When that bear was
chasing me through the woods,

41:58.583 --> 42:01.518
I was like I don't really
like it here right now.

42:02.387 --> 42:03.719
BRITTANY: It's much
better with me?

42:03.722 --> 42:05.121
Even when I'm chasing you out.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.023
KALEB: Yeah, I'd rather you
were chasing me through the woods.

42:07.392 --> 42:08.992
(laughing)

42:09.060 --> 42:11.261
BRITTANY: Hunting
bear or bear hunting?

42:11.329 --> 42:13.897
KALEB: That's a question, uh,
answer that I'll keep to myself.

42:14.866 --> 42:15.932
Love you.

42:15.934 --> 42:16.799
BRITTANY: I love you too.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.001
ELOVIE: Love ya.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.802
BRITTANY: All right kids,
let's go bring that inside.

42:19.804 --> 42:22.939
KALEB: This meat here
represents a lot of hard work,

42:23.475 --> 42:25.875
a lot of effort went into this.

42:26.878 --> 42:31.414
I will always maintain that a bad day in the
woods is better than a good day in the office.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.983
But this hunt exemplified that.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.887
JESSI: The bok choy,

42:37.889 --> 42:41.424
the lettuce, the onions, and me
have all been waiting so long for

42:41.426 --> 42:43.493
this exact moment.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.362
I'm like the happiest camper,
like the perfect little clam,

42:46.431 --> 42:47.897
I'm like snug as a bug in a rug.

42:47.966 --> 42:52.168
We are just so stoked to be here
seeing all this water to come down

42:52.170 --> 42:55.038
this super janky
contraption system.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.874
And like this is,
this is why I'm out here.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.978
They're happy little plants.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.379
They're gonna grow nice and big.

43:03.381 --> 43:06.149
How perfectly timed, and it's
the perfect amount of water.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.319
CHRIS: This is great.

43:09.721 --> 43:13.122
This project came to fruition from all
of the hoard that was around the cabin,

43:13.191 --> 43:16.159
Jessi and I put our heads together,
came up with a makeshift plan,

43:17.261 --> 43:20.329
and made a functioning
auto-watering garden system.

43:20.332 --> 43:22.865
The garden box is something
we needed out here.

43:22.867 --> 43:27.070
But really, seeing my wife smile
every day, that's the payoff for me.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.106
JESSI: All the way down.

43:33.678 --> 43:36.379
JOHNNY: So, this is kinda the end
result and this'll go onto the drying rack.

43:37.548 --> 43:40.950
This'll dry and then it'll
make good dog food for Java.

43:42.286 --> 43:46.623
What do you say, Java?
Yeah, you love it.

43:49.761 --> 43:52.762
It's a pretty good day today.

43:53.164 --> 43:57.767
Caught a lot of fish,
processed them, got Java food.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.970
I got myself food.

44:00.972 --> 44:06.342
It's another good day out here in
Alaska, living free, eating the wild.

44:07.512 --> 44:10.179
I honestly couldn't
ask for much more.

44:10.649 --> 44:11.764
Oh, you want a belly rub,

44:11.816 --> 44:13.716
you could ask for
more couldn't you?

44:13.718 --> 44:15.584
You want all kinds of stuff.

44:15.587 --> 44:18.388
You're never happy,
never satisfied.

44:18.456 --> 44:21.057
Are you, huh?
Never happy.
