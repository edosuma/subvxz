03:18.630 --> 03:20.996
WAY TO FIGHT
THROUGH IT, SAM.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.458
SAM ?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.197
SAM ?

03:31.330 --> 03:33.491
OKAY, OKAY,
HE'S BREATHING.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.195
HE'S GOT AIR.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.727
OH, FUCK.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.355
( coach )
GIVE A HAND
TO SAM, EVERYBODY.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.352
THIS IS THE SPIRIT
OF A REAL FOOTBALL PLAYER.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.356
( radio news playing )

04:05.360 --> 04:07.794
YOU THINK CAVIAR
IS TOO PRETENTIOUS ?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.052
WELL, WITH THE FOIE GRAS
AND THE SMOKED SALMON,

04:10.060 --> 04:13.826
IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE TRYING A LITTLE TOO HARD
TO IMPRESS THEM.

04:13.830 --> 04:14.956
FUCK.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.791
I DO WANT TO
IMPRESS THEM

04:16.800 --> 04:18.950
WITHOUT IT LOOKING LIKE
I COULD GIVE A SHIT,

04:18.960 --> 04:20.621
WHICH, ACTUALLY,
I DON'T.

04:20.630 --> 04:23.019
SO, WHY DO YOU
WANT TO IMPRESS THEM ?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.657
I DON'T KNOW.

04:24.660 --> 04:27.891
BECAUSE TREVOR WAS
A BIG PART OF MY LIFE ONCE.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.494
BECAUSE HIS WIFE WON A FUCKING
NATIONAL BOOK AWARD.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.025
BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING ELSE
TO OBSESS ABOUT.

04:33.030 --> 04:34.998
WELL, YOU HAVE ME.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.254
YOU I TAKE TOTALLY FOR GRANTED,
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT ?

04:38.260 --> 04:40.649
I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE FEELING BE'I'I'ER.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.696
YEAH, YOU AND ME
BOTH, BUCKO.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.122
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT DEPRESSION,

04:44.130 --> 04:45.859
IF YOU REALLY ALLOW
YOURSELF TO FEEL IT,

04:45.860 --> 04:47.828
IT GETS VERY BORING
VERY FAST.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.455
YOU'RE NOT JEALOUS,
ARE YOU ?

04:51.460 --> 04:53.690
OF TREVOR ?

04:53.700 --> 04:55.429
SHOULD I BE ?

04:55.430 --> 04:56.590
NO.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.828
OF COURSE NOT.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.526
SO WHAT IF HE'S THE MAN
WHOSE MASTERLY TOUCH

05:00.530 --> 05:02.521
USHERED ME
INTO WOMANHOOD ?

05:02.530 --> 05:05.397
THE ONE I ULTIMATELY COMPARE
ALL OTHER MEN TO.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.221
OKAY, OKAY, FINE,
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

05:08.230 --> 05:10.596
YOU'LL ONLY HAVE
YOURSELF TO BLAME
WHEN I GO ALL ALPHA DOG

05:10.600 --> 05:12.818
AND BEAT HIM TO A BLOODY PULP
IN FRONT OF HIS WIFE AND KID.

05:12.830 --> 05:15.594
OH, MY HERO.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.023
I'M GONNA
KICK HIS ASS.

05:18.030 --> 05:20.191
( laughing )
FUCKING TREVOR.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.418
FUCKING TREVOR.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.528
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. HUNTLEY.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.956
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER
SCORCHER, HUH ?

05:40.330 --> 05:43.299
WHERE ARE MY NEW ACQUISITIONS,
MR. GILARDI ?

05:43.300 --> 05:44.597
I'M ON IT.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.489
WHAT YOU'RE ON
IS MY SHIT LIST, COWBOY.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.718
I MADE YOU PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE

05:49.730 --> 05:52.255
FOR FINDING THREE HOMES
THAT WE COULD DUMP AT A PROFIT,

05:52.260 --> 05:54.319
AND WHAT DO
I GET FROM YOU ?

05:54.330 --> 05:56.218
DIDDLY SQUAT.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.994
I ALREADY CLOSED
MCKENZIE BROTHERS
AND DALE-MONTGOMERY.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.025
THREE NEW HOMES,
MR. GILARDI.

06:01.030 --> 06:03.749
APPARENTLY I MISJUDGED
YOUR CAPABILITIES.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.024
WHAT ABOUT
FISHER AND SONS ?

06:06.030 --> 06:08.351
YOU'VE BEEN AFI'ER THEM
FOR MONTHS NOW.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.796
THEY'RE MORE RESILIENT
THAN I EXPECTED.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.495
GEEZ-LOUISE, MATT,

06:13.500 --> 06:15.559
PLAY LIKE YOU GOT
A BIG DICK.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.323
CAN YOU GET 'EM
FOR ME OR NOT ?

06:17.330 --> 06:19.321
YOU SAID I HAD
UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.525
WELL, CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY,
YOU'RE FIRED.

06:22.630 --> 06:23.597
WHAT ?!

06:23.600 --> 06:25.921
YOUR PRESENCE
IS NO LONGER REQUIRED.

06:25.930 --> 06:27.727
YOU ARE HEREBY
RENDERED IRRELEVANT.

06:27.730 --> 06:29.322
YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.649
MITZI...

06:31.730 --> 06:33.698
I CAN DO THIS,
I SWEAR.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.497
NOW, JUST GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.491
YOU KNOW,
JUST BECAUSE I FUCKED YOU

06:37.500 --> 06:39.889
THAT DOESN'T PUT US
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.051
YOU'RE DRESSED EARLY.

06:51.060 --> 06:54.291
WE HAVE AN INTAKE AT 9:30,
JOSH LANGMEAD.

06:54.300 --> 06:56.552
AM I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW WHO THAT IS ?

06:56.560 --> 06:58.255
DON'T YOU
WATCH THE NEWS ?

06:58.260 --> 07:00.649
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT,
IT'S TOO DEPRESSING.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.548
JOSH LANGMEAD IS
THE CAL STATE FOOTBALL PLAYER

07:02.560 --> 07:04.391
WHO DIED OF HEAT STROKE
YESTERDAY.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.459
21 YEARS OLD,
IN PERFECT HEALTH,

07:06.460 --> 07:08.451
UNTIL HIS BRAIN FRIED.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.722
FUCK.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.648
WELL, I'M OFF
TO TORRANCE.

07:15.430 --> 07:18.558
I HAVE A BREAKFAST MEETING WITH
THE LIVING SPLENDOR SALES REP.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.892
WAIT A MINUTE,
THAT MEANS--

07:20.900 --> 07:22.720
NOW THAT YOU'RE A LICENSED
FUNERAL DIRECTOR,

07:22.730 --> 07:24.755
WE CAN GET TWICE AS MUCH
WORK DONE AROUND HERE.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.159
JUST DO ME A FAVOR,

07:26.160 --> 07:28.128
DON'T EVEN MENTION
THE WORD "CREMATION".

07:28.130 --> 07:31.122
OKAY, CAN I MENTION
THE WORD "CONDESCENDING" ?

07:31.130 --> 07:32.757
I'LL BE BACK
BY NOON.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.728
WE THOUGHT JOSH WOULD
WANT TO BE WEARING HIS NUMBER

07:46.730 --> 07:48.721
FOR THE VIEWING.

07:51.030 --> 07:52.497
OF COURSE.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.790
( father sobbing )

07:59.600 --> 08:02.819
I TOOK HIM TO HIS FIRST
RAMS GAME WHEN HE WAS THREE.

08:02.830 --> 08:06.322
WASN'T LONG AFI'ER
THAT HE STARTED
IN POP WARNER FOOTBALL.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.494
HE HAD...

08:12.830 --> 08:15.253
HE HAD
NFL SHEETS,

08:15.260 --> 08:18.752
CURTAINS, PAJAMAS.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.126
FIVE HALLOWEENS
IN A ROW

08:21.130 --> 08:23.189
HE WENT
AS BO JACKSON.

08:28.630 --> 08:31.428
( father )
IT WAS HIS DREAM
TO PLAY PRO.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.728
I BET
HE COULD'VE, TOO.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.994
I THINK
HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.127
HE WAS CERTAINLY
MOTIVATED ENOUGH.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.755
YOU EVER
PLAY BALL ?

08:42.760 --> 08:44.625
FOOTBALL ?

08:44.630 --> 08:46.188
NO, NO WAY.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.395
MY DAD WOULDN'T LET ME,
SAID IT WAS TOO DAN--

08:48.400 --> 08:50.960
I DID PLAY A LITTLE BASEBALL
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.797
HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION
ABOUT A CASKET ?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.428
WE LIKE
THE TITAN FOUR.

09:02.430 --> 09:04.398
HOW MUCH IS THAT ?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.391
92 HUNDRED.

09:12.730 --> 09:15.255
WHAT THE HELL,
IT'S ONLY MONEY.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.095
GRANTED, 14 HUNDRED
SQUARE FEET IS A BIT COZY,

09:23.100 --> 09:25.091
BUT THE LAYOUT
IS SO ERGONOMIC

09:25.100 --> 09:27.022
THAT IT FEELS
TWICE AS LARGE.

09:27.030 --> 09:30.397
HONEY, IT'S GOT A SUN ROOM
LIKE TIA RITA'S.

09:32.630 --> 09:34.928
GIRL'S GOTTA GET
A BETTER POKER FACE.

09:34.930 --> 09:36.352
TOO LATE.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.396
IT'S VERY GOOD THAT YOU BROUGHT
YOUR OWN INSPECTOR.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.595
UH, NO,
HE'S MY COUSIN.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.693
HE'S IN CONSTRUCTION.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.224
SO, WHAT'S WITH
THE FOUNDATION ?

09:44.230 --> 09:46.926
NOTHING,
PERFECT SHAPE.

09:46.930 --> 09:50.127
WELL, PART OF IT
WAS REBUILT TWO YEARS AGO

09:50.130 --> 09:52.348
TO THE TUNE
OF 20 THOUSAND.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.952
SO, IT'S BETTER
THAN NEW NOW.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.518
EXCUSE ME.

09:55.530 --> 09:58.727
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, MAN ?

09:58.730 --> 10:01.221
I'M NOT LIVIN' IN IT, MAN,
I GOT A HOUSE.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.652
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

10:02.660 --> 10:04.457
I DON'T KNOW,
VANESSA LIKES IT.

10:04.460 --> 10:07.429
YEAH, VANESSA LIKES DRAGGING
YOU AROUND BY YOUR CRANK, TOO,

10:07.430 --> 10:08.624
IS WHAT I THINK.

10:08.630 --> 10:10.723
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY WIFE, MAN.

10:10.730 --> 10:13.358
VAN ESSA AND ME ARE TIGHT, MAN,
YOU KNOW THAT.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.622
IT'S NOT ABOUT HER.

10:14.630 --> 10:16.393
I'M JUST BREAKIN' IT
DOWN TO YOU

10:16.400 --> 10:17.799
THE WAY THE GUYS
HAVE BEEN TELLING ME.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.290
YOU BEEN ACTING
LIKE A CANDY-ASS BITCH

10:19.300 --> 10:20.722
EVER SINCE
YOU GOT MARRIED.

10:20.730 --> 10:22.891
SCREW YOU, RAMON.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.788
HEY, SCREW ME
ALL YOU WANT.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.529
YOU KNOW
I'M RIGHT.

10:26.530 --> 10:29.499
WHAT ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE
DOING IN OUR NEW HOUSE ?

10:30.760 --> 10:33.558
BABY, YOU REALLY
LIKE THE HOUSE ?

10:33.560 --> 10:34.993
YES, YES, YES !

10:35.000 --> 10:38.094
RICO, THE HOUSE
IS GOOD.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.354
IT'S GOT SOME LITTLE PROBLEMS,
BUT NOTHING I CAN'T FIX.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.624
RICO, THERE'S A YARD
FOR THE BOYS.

10:43.630 --> 10:46.053
THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO WALK TO SCHOOL,
YOU'RE CLOSER TO WORK.

10:46.060 --> 10:48.221
RAMON, CAN WE USE
YOUR TRUCK TO MOVE ?

11:24.360 --> 11:26.726
( sobbing )

11:28.360 --> 11:29.827
( phone )

11:33.260 --> 11:34.921
NATE FISHER.

11:34.930 --> 11:36.693
( female )
Hi there, Nate,

11:36.700 --> 11:38.497
this is Sherrie
from Appleby Caskets.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.650
We received your fax order,
and I'm awfully sorry,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.753
_ but the Titan Four_
IS no longer In production.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.159
YOU GOTTA BE
SHITTING ME.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.822
Uh, you must not have
our 2002 catalog.

11:46.830 --> 11:49.719
WHAT'S THE CLOSEST CASKET
TO THE TITAN ?

11:49.730 --> 11:51.891
That would probably be
our Haven Two,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.356
41 hundred wholesale,

11:53.360 --> 11:55.191
usually retails
for about 11.6.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.827
SON-OF-A-MOTHER-FUCK.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.229
Sir ?

11:58.230 --> 12:01.051
ALRIGHT, I'LL HAVE
TO GET BACK TO YOU.

12:14.130 --> 12:16.553
I SWEAR, I FUCKING
HATE PUBLIC SCHOOL.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.152
THIS YEAR-ROUND SHIT ?

12:18.160 --> 12:19.388
FUCK.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.550
B TRACK GETS
ALL OF OCTOBER OFF,

12:21.560 --> 12:23.425
AND THEN SIX WEEKS
IN THE SPRING.

12:23.430 --> 12:25.057
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

12:25.060 --> 12:27.028
THIS PERSIAN GIRL WHO USED TO BE
MY BEST FRIEND AT ARCHER

12:27.030 --> 12:28.691
UNTIL I FUCKED HER
BROTHER,

12:28.700 --> 12:31.157
SHE'S SPENDING
THE ENTIRE SUMMER IN FRANCE.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.923
WHERE THE FUCK
IS GABE ?

12:32.930 --> 12:35.091
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET US HERE
LIKE, 10 MINUTES AGO.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.795
DINK, IT'S GONNA
BE ALRIGHT, MAN.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.859
EVERYTHING IS CHILL.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.623
IT'S NOT CHILL.

12:40.630 --> 12:43.690
THE COPS HAVE THAT FUCKING VIDEO
IN EVERY SCHOOL IN LA. !

12:44.900 --> 12:47.824
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVEN'T
I.D.ed US YET, OKAY ?

12:47.830 --> 12:50.458
WHICH MEANS THEY PROBABLY
CAN'T I.D. US,

12:50.460 --> 12:52.052
AND ANYONE WHO COULD
IS GONNA KEEP QUIET

12:52.060 --> 12:53.789
IF THEY KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR 'EM.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.722
WE BETTER
FUCKIN' HOPE SO.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.288
DID YOU FUCKING--

12:57.300 --> 12:59.029
DID YOU
TELL SOMEBODY ?

12:59.030 --> 13:00.554
BECAUSE IF YOU
FUCKING TOLD SOMEBODY

13:00.560 --> 13:02.448
I WILL FUCKING
KILL YOUR BITCH ASS,
DO YOU HEAR ME ?

13:02.460 --> 13:04.052
( phone ringing )
NO, ASSHOLE !

13:04.060 --> 13:05.618
WHAT ABOUT ANDY ?

13:05.630 --> 13:07.723
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ?
HE'S YOUR FUCKING BEST FRIEND.

13:07.730 --> 13:09.357
( phone )

13:11.660 --> 13:13.457
WHAT ?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.997
AH, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET US
LIKE, 10 MINUTES AGO.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.797
WE'RE WAITING.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.121
JESUS, CLAIRE,
DON'T PUSSY-WHIP HIM.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.995
YOU GOTTA ACT LIKE
YOU DON'T CARE.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.127
GUYS HATE IT
WHEN YOU'RE ALL OVER THEM.

13:24.130 --> 13:26.098
LIKE YOU'VE EVER STUCK AROUND
LONG ENOUGH TO FIND OUT,

13:26.100 --> 13:28.193
WONDER-SLUT.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.521
WHAT,
SQUIRREL NUT ?

13:31.530 --> 13:34.055
YOUR SOUL
IS ON FIRE.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.925
I KNOW.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.721
OUR SOULS
ARE ON FIRE.

13:39.730 --> 13:41.391
WHOA,

13:41.400 --> 13:43.550
YOU ARE NOT ON THE LIST
OF PEOPLE WHO GET
TO TOUCH MY TITS.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.960
AHH... !

13:48.600 --> 13:50.818
ANDY,
WHAT IS WRONG ?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.753
THE FUCK OFF ME,
GET 'EM OFF ME !

13:57.760 --> 13:59.853
WHOA, THIS IS
SO FUCKED UP.

14:01.030 --> 14:03.089
OH, GOD !

14:03.100 --> 14:04.897
ANDY !

14:04.900 --> 14:06.754
ANDY, SAY
SOMETHING TO ME.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.899
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW !

14:08.900 --> 14:11.198
ANDY, ANDY,
OH, MY GOD.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.428
AN DY.

14:12.430 --> 14:13.749
AN DY,
LOOK AT ME.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.091
GO GET THE NURSE.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.328
DID HE
TAKE SOMETHING ?

14:16.330 --> 14:17.456
GO!

14:17.460 --> 14:18.893
STOP IT.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.856
ANDY, STOP IT RIGHT NOW,
YOU FUCKING BITCH,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.953
OR I WILL KICK THE SHIT
OUT OF YOU, DO YOU HEAR ME ?

14:22.960 --> 14:25.622
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU LOOKING AT ?!

14:25.630 --> 14:28.690
( David )
I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK THE TITAN
SERIES WAS OUT OF PRODUCTION.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.998
( Nate )
YEAH, WELL, I THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD'VE TORN THE DAMN PAGE

14:31.000 --> 14:32.399
OUT OF THE CATALOG.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.152
IT WAS
AN HONEST MISTAKE.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.321
WE'LL GIVE THEM THE HAVEN TWO
FOR 11 INSTEAD OF 11.6.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.525
DAVID, THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING
MORE THAN THEY CAN AFFORD.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.350
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.351
GOD, I CANNOT TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I HATE IT
WHEN YOU PATRONIZE ME.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.588
I'M BEING
UNDERSTANDING.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.454
YOU WANT PATRONIZING,
I'LL GIVE YOU PATRONIZING.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.428
UH-HUH.
HEY, GUYS.

14:47.430 --> 14:49.728
HEY, RICO, LANGMEAD'S
IN THE REEFER.

14:49.730 --> 14:51.618
YEAH, YOU GUYS
GOT A MOMENT ?

14:51.630 --> 14:53.154
YEAH,
WHAT'S UP ?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.594
VANESSA AND I
FOUND A HOUSE.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.953
OH, RICO,
THAT'S GREAT.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.928
YEAH, YEAH,
WE REALLY LIKE THE HOUSE,

14:58.930 --> 15:02.855
AND WE CAN SWING
THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS...

15:02.860 --> 15:05.124
IF WE PUT DOWN
20 PERCENT.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.253
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT ?

15:09.260 --> 15:11.592
WELL, WE'VE PIECED MOST OF IT
TOGETHER, BUT...

15:11.600 --> 15:15.422
WE'RE ABOUT
11 GRAND SHORT.

15:15.430 --> 15:16.590
( whistling )

15:16.600 --> 15:17.794
1 1 THOUSAND ?

15:17.800 --> 15:18.789
YUP.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.392
BY TOMORROW.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.721
LOOK, WE'LL PAY YOU BACK

15:22.730 --> 15:25.153
OVER 18 MONTHS
AT SEVEN PERCENT INTEREST,

15:25.160 --> 15:26.923
THAT'S A LOT BETTER
THAN THE BANK,

15:26.930 --> 15:28.852
AND NOT TOO FAR
OFF THE MARKET.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.853
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
BY TOMORROW.

15:35.700 --> 15:36.997
THAN KS.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.719
BUT RIGHT NOW, MR. LANGMEAD
NEEDS YOUR ATTENTION.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.857
I'M ON IT.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.853
SEE ?
IAM UNDERSTANDING.

15:51.730 --> 15:53.948
THAT'S A LOVELY
ARRANGEMENT.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.257
WHAT IS IT ?

15:55.260 --> 15:56.796
SCALENE VASE.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.292
DIDN'T THEY TEACH YOU ANYTHING
AT DAFFODIL UNIVERSITY ?

16:04.330 --> 16:06.321
ACTUALLY, IT'S...

16:06.330 --> 16:10.824
A COMBINATION
OF INVERTED-T AND SCALENE.

16:10.830 --> 16:12.559
IT'S MY OWN DESIGN.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.699
AND, UM...

16:16.560 --> 16:18.858
IT'S YOURS.

16:18.860 --> 16:21.920
NO, I JUST WANTED TO LEARN
HOW TO MAKE ONE.

16:21.930 --> 16:23.727
IT'S A GIFT
FROM MY HEART.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.948
SERIOUSLY.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.350
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
ROBBIE.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.597
OKAY, RUTH,

16:34.600 --> 16:39.549
THIS IS GONNA BE
HARD FOR ME TO SAY, BUT, UM...

16:41.330 --> 16:43.491
I FORGIVE YOU.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.819
FORGIVE ME ?

16:44.830 --> 16:46.422
FOR WHAT ?

16:46.430 --> 16:51.356
YOU DESTROYED THE NATURAL ORDER
OF THE UNIVERSE, CUPCAKE.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.999
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT LY
QUIET AND BORING AROUND HERE

16:54.000 --> 16:55.524
BEFORE YOU CAME.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.395
AND NOW NIKOLAI'S
ALL AFLUTTER,

16:57.400 --> 16:59.493
WANTING TO MAKE
IMPROVEMENTS,

16:59.500 --> 17:01.195
I'M EXPECTED TO WORK.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.020
FOR HIS OWN
CARNAL REASONS,

17:03.030 --> 17:05.089
HE FAVORS YOU OVER ME,
AND FOR THAT,

17:05.100 --> 17:07.591
I FORGIVE YOU.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.352
I RESENT THAT !

17:09.360 --> 17:13.296
I'VE ALWAYS CONDUCTED MYSELF
WITH COMPLETE PROFESSIONALISM.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.157
WHATEVER, RUTH,
I FORGIVE YOU.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.822
I DON'T NEED
YOUR FORGIVENESS !

17:21.630 --> 17:23.689
OH, NO,
OH, GODDAMNIT.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.656
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO GO THIS WAY.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.355
WHAT ISN'T ?

17:27.360 --> 17:28.850
OKAY, RUTH.

17:28.860 --> 17:32.728
I'M GRADUATING
FROM THE PLAN TOMORROW

17:32.730 --> 17:35.790
AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT
IF YOU WOULD BE MY WITNESS.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.098
"THE PLAN" ?
WHAT IS "THE PLAN" ?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.829
IT'S A MULTI-DISCIPLINED COURSE

17:39.830 --> 17:43.288
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK
WAY BEYOND YOURSELF,

17:43.300 --> 17:45.598
AND REBUILD YOUR LIFE
FROM THE GROUND FLOOR,

17:45.600 --> 17:46.999
PLANK BY PLAN K.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.888
THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.428
IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF,

17:52.430 --> 17:54.421
AND GET WHAT
YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

17:54.430 --> 17:56.352
YOU WANT TO GO ?

17:56.360 --> 18:00.091
IT WOULD REALLY...

18:00.100 --> 18:02.955
MEAN A LOT
TO ME, RUTH.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.159
WOW.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.918
PRETTY SWEET, HUH ?

18:23.600 --> 18:26.922
EACH PORTAL IS LIT
BY RECESSED HALOGENS.

18:26.930 --> 18:29.421
TASTEFUL SIGNAGE
FOR THE MODEL NAME,

18:29.430 --> 18:31.489
MATERIALS,
AND PRICING.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.354
AND THIS LITTLE
DRAWER HERE ?

18:33.360 --> 18:36.352
THIS DISPLAYS YOUR
INTERIOR UPHOLSTERY FABRIC.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.420
POINT-OF-PURCHASE DOES NOT
GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS,
MY FRIENDS.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.227
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

18:41.230 --> 18:43.619
IMPRESSIVE ?
IT'S FUCKING GORGEOUS.

18:43.630 --> 18:46.155
IT'S A COMPLETELY INTERACTIVE
RETAIL EXPERIENCE.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.526
BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS,
WE'RE TACTILE.

18:48.530 --> 18:50.953
WE LIKE TO TOUCH THE FRUIT
BEFORE WE BUY.

18:50.960 --> 18:54.088
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
ARE STILL USING A CATALOG.

18:54.930 --> 18:58.127
NOW, THESE CASKETS HERE
ARE ON THE UPPER LEVEL,

18:58.130 --> 18:59.620
THEY APPEAL TO MEN.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.427
IT'S AT THEIR
AVERAGE HEIGHT.

19:01.430 --> 19:03.591
DOWN BELOW ARE
THE LADY'S FAVORITES.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.750
I HAVE SEEN THE FUTURE
AND THIS IS IT.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.318
DAVE,
WHERE WOULD IT GO ?

19:07.330 --> 19:08.820
WE PUT IT IN
THE SECOND VIEWING ROOM.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.252
THE ROOM WE'VE BEEN
USING FOR STORAGE ?

19:10.260 --> 19:11.796
THAT ROOM
NEEDS SERIOUS WORK.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.995
SO, WE USE THIS
AS A REASON TO DO IT.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.820
HAVEN'T WE BEEN PLANNING
TO DO THAT WITH THE MONEY

19:15.830 --> 19:17.388
MOM GAVE US ANYWAY ?

19:17.400 --> 19:19.493
DAVE, THAT MONEY'S
ALMOST ALL GONE.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.355
A TWO BY FIVE LIKE THIS
WILL NOT BREAK YOUR BACK,

19:22.360 --> 19:24.191
21.5

19:27.560 --> 19:29.755
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
20 EVEN,

19:29.760 --> 19:31.648
THAT INCLUDES
INSTALLATION.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.322
I'LL EVEN THROW IN A FRESH COAT
OF PAINT FOR YOUR ROOM.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.594
YOU CANNOT BEAT THAT
WITH A STICK.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.125
NATE, YOU ALWAYS SAY WE HAVE TO
SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.950
ALRIGHT,
HOW LONG TO INSTALL ?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.497
GIVE ME THE WORD AND YOU'LL BE
MAKING SALES IN TWO DAYS.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.850
YOU REALLY LIKE IT ?

19:46.860 --> 19:48.521
WHO WOULDN'T ?!

19:49.460 --> 19:52.020
I'VE NEVER SEEN
DAVID HAPPIER.

19:52.030 --> 19:54.294
IT WAS LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.126
WHOA.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.496
YOU WORKING OUT A LITTLE
AGGRESSION THERE ?

20:03.500 --> 20:05.354
WE'RE HAVING
CHICKEN PICCATA,

20:05.360 --> 20:07.749
I WANT TO MARINATE IT
OVERNIGHT.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.591
YOU NEVER
COOK LIKE THIS FOR ME.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.397
YOU NEVER EVEN COOK.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.721
AND WHEN TREVOR
GOES BACK TO NEW HAVEN,

20:13.730 --> 20:16.324
I NEED YOU
TO FORGET THAT I CAN.

20:16.330 --> 20:17.797
ALRIGHT,
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR ?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.360
A SPEEDO,
HAIR EXTENSIONS.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.521
WEAR WHAT YOU WANT,
I DON'T CARE.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.555
DON'T WEAR ONE OF
YOUR FUNERAL SUITS.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.028
OH, I THOUGHT
YOU DON'T CARE.

20:27.660 --> 20:31.653
WEAR SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE THE SEXY BAD BOY

20:31.660 --> 20:33.753
YOU REALLY ARE.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.149
SOMETHING THAT MAKES
MR. WIFE AND KIDS

20:36.160 --> 20:38.651
QUESTION ALL
HIS MIDDLE-CLASS CHOICES.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.059
I'M ALL FOR THAT.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.652
JUST AS LONG AS YOU WEAR
SOMETHING LOW CUT IN THE BACK

20:41.660 --> 20:44.527
SO HE CAN SEE MY NAME
BRANDED ON YOUR ASS !

21:00.000 --> 21:04.391
( hammering )

21:08.700 --> 21:10.224
HELLO !

21:14.830 --> 21:16.525
HELLO ?!

21:20.160 --> 21:21.457
HELLO ?

21:28.230 --> 21:28.889
HELLO.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.052
HEY.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.699
NEW CASKET WALL, HUH ?

21:34.700 --> 21:37.260
YOU BOYS ARE DOING
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.491
I'M MITZI DALTON HUNTLEY.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.229
DAVID FISHER.

21:44.230 --> 21:46.596
DO YOU NEED
TO PLAN A FUNERAL ?

21:48.460 --> 21:51.793
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO I AM, DO YOU ?

21:51.800 --> 21:53.950
I'M SOUTHWEST
REGIONAL DIRECTOR

21:53.960 --> 21:56.622
FOR KROEHNER SERVICES
INTERNATIONAL.

21:56.630 --> 21:59.497
I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER

21:59.500 --> 22:01.752
MIGHT SHARE
A CUP OF COFFEE WITH ME.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.457
WELL, HELLO.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.826
MITZI DALTON HUNTLEY.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.491
NATE FISHER.

22:18.460 --> 22:21.099
YOU'RE A RUNNER, HUH ?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.922
THAT'S BAD
FOR YOUR KNEES.

22:23.930 --> 22:26.558
YEAH, WELL, EVERYTHING'S
BAD FOR SOMETHING.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.391
SO, I HEAR.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.228
WHY ARE YOU HERE ?

22:31.230 --> 22:33.095
I MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR
TO MATT GILARDI

22:33.100 --> 22:34.749
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN SELLING.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.399
OH, MATT GILARDI IS
NO LONGER WITH KROEHNER.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.049
YEP.

22:39.060 --> 22:41.494
I FIRED HIS WORTHLESS ASS
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY

22:41.500 --> 22:43.718
THAT HE WAS
REPRESENTING OUR COMPANY.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.698
AND THAT IS WHY
I'M HERE TODAY,

22:45.700 --> 22:47.622
TO DO A LITTLE
DAMAGE CONTROL

22:47.630 --> 22:51.191
AND APOLOGIZE
TO YOU BOYS.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.622
RIGHT.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.723
OH, I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR NOT TRUSTING ME.

22:54.730 --> 22:56.652
FRANKLY, I'D BE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU IF YOU DID.

22:56.660 --> 22:58.525
CREAM WITH
THREE SUGARS.

22:58.530 --> 22:59.690
WELL, THANK YOU.

22:59.700 --> 23:02.726
YOU DIDN'T PUT RAT POISON
IN HERE, DID YOU ?

23:02.730 --> 23:04.698
DRINK IT
AND FIND OUT.

23:07.930 --> 23:09.158
OH, PLEASE.

23:09.160 --> 23:12.618
YOU BOYS AREN'T AFRAID
OF BIG BAD MITZI, ARE YOU ?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.195
C'MON.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.827
THE ECONOMY
IS IN A TAILSPIN.

23:16.830 --> 23:19.048
CORPORATIONS
ARE DOWNSIZING,

23:19.060 --> 23:21.494
AND RE-SIZING
AND REORGANIZING,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.229
INCLUDING KROEHNER.

23:23.230 --> 23:24.891
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE YOU OVER.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.595
HONEY, WE GOT
PROBLEMS OF OUR OWN.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.420
OKAY, LET'S JUST
CUT THE FOREPLAY.

23:28.430 --> 23:30.250
BUT THAT'S
THE BEST PART.

23:30.260 --> 23:32.728
IT'S NOT THAT
WE DON'T TRUST YOU.

23:32.730 --> 23:34.550
WE DESPISE EVERYTHING
YOU STAND FOR.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.425
CORPORATE PROFITS
OVER PERSONAL SERVICE,

23:36.430 --> 23:37.795
STOCKHOLDERS
OVER CLIENTS,

23:37.800 --> 23:39.654
GREED OVER
EVERYTHING ELSE.

23:39.660 --> 23:41.457
SO, I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE
YOUR GESTURE OF GOOD FAITH

23:41.460 --> 23:43.553
AND SHOVE IT
UP YOUR ASS.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.991
WELL, THAT'S
ONE OPINION.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.389
ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD
CARE TO ADD, DAVID ?

23:49.400 --> 23:52.892
NO, I THINK NATE PRETTY MUCH
SUMMED OUR POSITION UP.

23:53.860 --> 23:56.397
WELL, ALRIGHTY, THEN.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.094
I'LL JUST
SHOW MYSELF OUT.

24:03.460 --> 24:04.859
BY THE WAY,

24:04.860 --> 24:07.522
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CLEAN OUT
YOUR COFFEE-MAKER.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.555
YOUR COFFEE SUCKS.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.193
THIS IS NOT
SO GOOD.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.020
WHO THE FUCK IS NAMED
"MITZI" ANYWAY ?

24:17.030 --> 24:19.419
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
YOU'D NAME A FUCKING CHIHUAHUA.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.823
( Nate )
PRETTY BITCHIN', HUH ?

24:31.830 --> 24:35.197
WHEN DID YOU START GETTING
A PUP TENT OVER CASKETS ?

24:35.200 --> 24:37.225
YOU'RE TURNING
INTO DAVID.

24:37.230 --> 24:39.152
DON'T EVER
SAY THAT AGAIN.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.094
( Rico )
VERY NICE.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.819
OH, WELCOME TO
CASKETERIA.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.457
MAY I
TAKE YOUR ORDER ?

24:47.560 --> 24:50.256
SO, MR. LANGMEAD
IS ALL READY TO GO.

24:50.260 --> 24:51.693
GREAT.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.122
YEAH.

24:53.130 --> 24:56.395
SO, NATE, HAVE YOU GUYS
HAD A CHANCE TO
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE...

24:56.400 --> 24:57.856
YOU KNOW.

24:57.860 --> 24:59.088
AH, YEAH.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.398
YEAH, LET'S GO
INTO THE OFFICE.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.526
OKAY.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.298
SO, DO THESE
REALLY OPEN ?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.359
CAN YOU LIKE,
HIDE SHIT IN HERE ?

25:12.830 --> 25:14.457
CLOSE THE DOOR ?

25:16.960 --> 25:19.428
"CLOSE THE DOOR"
DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD.

25:24.060 --> 25:26.324
WE CAN'T GIVE YOU
A LOAN RIGHT NOW, RICO.

25:27.300 --> 25:30.292
LOOK, WE JUST SPENT A FORTUNE
ON THE NEW CASKET WALL.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.121
AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOTTA
MAINTAIN AN EMERGENCY FUND

25:33.130 --> 25:35.098
IN CASE KROEHNER
STARTS ACTING UP AGAIN,

25:35.100 --> 25:36.727
WHICH SUDDENLY
LOOKS VERY LIKELY.

25:36.730 --> 25:39.722
IT WAS A TOUGH CHOICE,
I'M SORRY.

25:40.860 --> 25:43.556
HOW MUCH DID
THAT CASKET WALL COST ?

25:47.100 --> 25:49.455
RICO, OUR FIRST PRIORITY
IS KEEPING THIS HOUSE OPEN.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.758
THE MORE INCOME WE MAKE,
THE MORE YOU CAN MAKE.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.920
TELL ME ONE THING.

25:52.930 --> 25:54.557
DID YOU AND DAVID
DECIDE TO BUY THAT WALL

25:54.560 --> 25:56.050
BEFORE OR
AFTER WE SPOKE ?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.193
WOW.

26:01.730 --> 26:04.198
YOU KNOW, FIRST
YOU WON'T MAKE ME A PARTNER,

26:04.200 --> 26:05.929
NOW YOU
WON'T EVEN--

26:05.930 --> 26:08.649
GOD, I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU MOPING
ABOUT NOT BEING A PARTNER !

26:08.660 --> 26:10.150
IT'S NOT HAPPENING,
ALRIGHT ?!

26:10.160 --> 26:12.048
I WISH I COULD HELP YOU,
BUT I CAN'T.

26:12.060 --> 26:14.927
I MEAN, FUCK,
WE'RE YOUR EMPLOYER, ALRIGHT ?

26:14.930 --> 26:17.353
WE'RE NOT A GODDAMN
SAVINGS AND LOAN !

26:22.960 --> 26:25.099
I'M SORRY, RICO.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.858
IF IT WERE MY MONEY,
I'D GIVE YOU ALL OF IT,
YOU KNOW THAT.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.054
YEAH.

26:32.430 --> 26:35.752
YEAH, YEAH, I'LL PASS THAT
ALONG TO MY KIDS...

26:36.760 --> 26:39.991
WHO HAVE TO PLAY
IN A PARKING LOT
NEXT TO A DUMPSTER.

26:47.530 --> 26:48.952
FUCK.

26:51.430 --> 26:53.352
( Sighing loudly)

27:13.400 --> 27:15.550
I'M SCARED.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.921
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO ME NOW ?

27:19.930 --> 27:21.921
WELL, THAT'S NOT
MY PROBLEM, PAL.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.890
WHAT ?!

27:29.900 --> 27:32.050
I WAS SO YOUNG.

27:32.060 --> 27:33.857
WHY ME ?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.725
WELL, WHY THE FUCK
NOT YOU ?

27:35.730 --> 27:37.459
WHAT DID YOU THINK,
YOU WERE IMMUNE TO THIS ?

27:37.460 --> 27:39.189
EVERYBODY DIES,
EVERYBODY !

27:39.200 --> 27:41.657
WHAT MAKES YOU
SO FUCKING SPECIAL ?!

27:55.600 --> 27:57.249
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

27:57.260 --> 27:59.251
I'M NOT SIGNING UP
FOR ANYTHING.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.558
OH, I'M NOT
SELLING ANYTHING.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.051
I'M A VISITOR
JUST LIKE YOU.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.125
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU CAN TELL ?

28:07.130 --> 28:09.690
THE ELEVATED WEAR
PLASTIC TAGS.

28:09.700 --> 28:10.849
"THE ELEVATED" ?

28:10.860 --> 28:12.452
OH, YOU'LL
LEARN THE LINGO.

28:12.460 --> 28:15.429
MY DAUGHTER
IS GRADUATING TODAY.

28:15.430 --> 28:16.624
YOU ?

28:16.630 --> 28:17.927
MY, UH...

28:17.930 --> 28:19.625
BUSINESS ASSOCIATE
IS GRADUATING.

28:19.630 --> 28:21.621
SO, WHAT EXACTLY
IS THIS ?

28:21.630 --> 28:23.621
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE MYSELF.

28:23.630 --> 28:26.690
BUT SHEILA HAS
NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.919
SO, I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.

28:29.930 --> 28:32.125
( female )
LET'S GET STARTED.

28:32.130 --> 28:35.520
TODAY JUST MIGHT BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

28:35.530 --> 28:37.088
COME SIT WITH ME.

28:37.100 --> 28:39.193
THERE'S SAFETY
IN NUMBERS.

28:41.260 --> 28:44.252
YOU CANNOT DESIGN
A LIFE THAT WORKS

28:44.260 --> 28:46.956
WITHOUT FIRST DRAFTING
A CLEAR BLUEPRINT.

28:46.960 --> 28:50.191
AND YOU CANNOT CONSTRUCT A LIFE
THAT HAS MEANING

28:50.200 --> 28:53.795
WITHOUT FIRST
LAYING A SOLID FOUNDATION.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.759
YOU ARE THE ARCHITECT
OF YOUR LIFE,

28:57.760 --> 29:00.422
NOT YOUR EMOTIONALLY
DISTANT FATHER,

29:00.430 --> 29:03.490
NOT YOUR OVERLY
CRITICAL MOTHER,

29:03.500 --> 29:05.297
NOT YOUR PETTY,

29:05.300 --> 29:07.325
FAIR-WEATHER FRIENDS...

29:08.260 --> 29:09.852
YOU.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.096
IT WAS HARD,

29:20.100 --> 29:22.557
THE FIRST TIME
I STOOD UP FOR MYSELF.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.996
I ALWAYS WANTED
EVERYBODY TO LIKE ME.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.221
EVEN THOUGH I HATED MYSELF,
YOU HAD TO LIKE ME.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.698
WHEN I RE-BUILT
MY FOUNDATION,

29:32.700 --> 29:36.659
AND I WAS ABLE
TO HONOR AND ELEVATE

29:36.660 --> 29:38.321
THE BETTER PART OF ME,

29:38.330 --> 29:41.254
I REALIZED
I REALLY LIKE ME.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.626
SO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.999
I AM NOT
A SALVAGE JOB.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.219
I AM NOT A TEAR-DOWN,
I AM NOT JUNK.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.898
IT'S TAKEN ME MANY YEARS
TO SAY THAT,

29:57.900 --> 29:59.993
TO BELIEVE IT.

30:00.530 --> 30:03.954
THERE ARE DAYS THAT I SLIP
AND I TREAT PEOPLE LIKE SHIT...

30:06.100 --> 30:08.853
LIKE I TREATED MYSELF
FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.820
BUT DAMNIT, I SWEAR,
I'M GONNA WIN THIS.

30:12.830 --> 30:15.253
I'M GONNA
BUILD THE LIFE

30:15.260 --> 30:19.128
THAT I ALWAYS
WANTED TO LIVE.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.828
YEAH, OKAY.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.620
I THOUGHT
IT WAS TOO LATE.

30:30.630 --> 30:33.326
TWO TERRIBLE MARRIAGES,

30:33.330 --> 30:37.198
CHILDREN WHO...

30:37.200 --> 30:39.521
WON'T EVEN
RETURN MY PHONE CALLS.

30:39.530 --> 30:41.157
IT HURTS.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.220
I'M 41
AND FEEL LIKE I'M 80.

30:44.230 --> 30:47.119
BUT I HAVE VALUE.

30:47.130 --> 30:50.019
I'M STILL HERE.

30:50.030 --> 30:53.818
AND AS LONG AS
I BELIEVE IN MYSELF,

30:53.830 --> 30:57.527
AND SPEAK FIERCELY
FROM THE "I",

30:57.530 --> 31:00.055
THEN THERE'S
STILL HOPE.

31:00.060 --> 31:02.597
THERE'S NO MORTGAGE
ON MY LIFE.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.251
I OWN IT.

31:05.260 --> 31:08.696
THANK YOU, MOM.

31:38.860 --> 31:40.293
WELL, THAT WAS
HUMILIATING.

31:40.300 --> 31:42.689
AS IF MY SELF-ESTEEM
WASN'T LOW ENOUGH.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.793
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.654
ALL THAT TIME WE WERE
"RACQUETBALL PARTNERS"

31:46.660 --> 31:49.254
WE ACTUALLY NEVER
PLAYED RACQUETBALL.

31:49.260 --> 31:51.194
I AM SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING
TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.622
YOU AVAILABLE
THURSDAY AFTERNOON ?

31:52.630 --> 31:54.495
I DON'T KNOW,
I'LL CHECK.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.357
HEY, YOU WANNA DROP BY MY
NIECE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY LATER ?

31:58.360 --> 32:00.157
EDDIE'S ON CALL.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.650
UH, SURE.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.059
I GOT A COUPLE
ERRANDS TO RUN.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.597
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.953
I'VE GOT
NOTHING TO DO.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.190
I'LL JUST TAG ALONG,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.298
OH, MY GOD,
DID YOU HEAR ?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.653
ANDY WAS DOING FRY.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.196
I'M SORRY,
IN ENGLISH ?

32:17.200 --> 32:18.224
FRY.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.697
WET, ILLY.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.895
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF FRY.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.595
I'M SORRY,

32:23.600 --> 32:26.228
MY PAROLE OFFICER FROWNS ON
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.

32:26.230 --> 32:27.492
OKAY.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.957
YOU TAKE YOUR STANDARD
GARDEN VARIETY DOOBIE, RIGHT ?

32:29.960 --> 32:31.598
YOU DIP IT
IN EMBALMING FLUID,

32:31.600 --> 32:34.353
CUT IT WITH
GOD KNOWS WHAT AND, BAM,

32:34.360 --> 32:37.488
ALL YOUR STATES ARE ALTERED
AND YOU SEE GOD.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.821
OR YOU'RE
IN TWEAKER HELL,

32:39.830 --> 32:41.923
BOUNCING OFF LOCKERS AND
SWALLOWING YOUR OWN TONGUE,

32:41.930 --> 32:42.999
LIKE ANDY.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.298
EMBALMING FLUID,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

32:45.300 --> 32:47.757
I'VE SMELLED THAT SHIT,
IT'S LIKE, LETHAL.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.955
YOU OUGHTA
GET OUT MORE.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.120
LIVE A LITTLE.

32:51.130 --> 32:52.552
NO.
YOU'VE DONE THIS ?

32:52.560 --> 32:55.097
BUT IF YOU EVER WANTED
TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK...

32:55.100 --> 32:57.022
OH, FUCK OFF,
PARKER.

32:57.030 --> 32:59.157
I'M NOT GETTING INTO THE POT
AND EMBALMING FLUID BUSINESS.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.549
I'VE HAD ENOUGH RUN-INS
WITH THE POLICE, THANK YOU.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.448
AT 50 DOLLARS
A POP ?

33:03.460 --> 33:06.588
YOU MIGHT
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.789
OH, MY GOD,
THAT FUCKING ASSHOLE.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.392
RIGHT, RIGHT ?

33:14.400 --> 33:18.951
ANDY'S GONNA BE
IN DETOX FOR LIKE, A WEEK.

33:21.860 --> 33:23.521
LOOK OKAY ?

33:23.530 --> 33:25.054
IT LOOKS FINE.

33:25.060 --> 33:28.291
IT LOOKS LIKE A PAGE
OUT OF "GOURMET" MAGAZINE.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.756
EXCELLENT.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.455
YOU KNOW THEY PUT
HAIR SPRAY ON FOOD

33:31.460 --> 33:33.121
BEFORE THEY PHOTOGRAPH IT
SOMETIMES ?

33:33.130 --> 33:34.427
REALLY.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.751
YEAH, I USED TO GO OUT WITH
THIS FOOD STYLIST IN SEATTLE.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.092
THEY DO STUFF TO FOOD

33:39.100 --> 33:41.250
THAT IS WAY WORSE THAN
WHAT WE DO TO DEAD BODIES,

33:41.260 --> 33:42.488
BELIEVE YOU ME.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.752
( knocking )

33:48.330 --> 33:50.491
OKAY...

33:51.800 --> 33:53.051
TELL ME
I LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.823
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.397
WOW.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.459
YOU EVEN MEAN THAT.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.655
OKAY.

34:09.700 --> 34:11.452
HEY !

34:20.430 --> 34:22.057
OH, MY GOD.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.051

OH, I REALLY
WANTED TO MEET HIM.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.490
HEY.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.819
HI, WILL.

34:37.830 --> 34:40.219

WILL, CAN YOU

34:40.230 --> 34:42.858
HE'LL CRASH

34:42.860 --> 34:44.657
HI, I'M TREVOR.

34:44.660 --> 34:46.196
NATE, DAWN.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.895
( Dawn )
PLEASURE.
HI, HOW ARE YOU ?

34:47.900 --> 34:49.629
( Trevor )
THANKS.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.824
OH, THIS IS
REALLY COOL.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.752
YEAH.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.290
SO, WINE,
ANYONE ?

34:58.300 --> 34:59.289
I'D LOVE A GLASS.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.756
YOU'RE DRIVING.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.897
ALRIGHT.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.821
(Will )
I WANT WINE !

35:02.830 --> 35:03.751
OH, YOU DO,
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

35:03.760 --> 35:06.092
"I WANT WINE, PLEASE."

35:06.100 --> 35:08.227
( Dawn )
ALRIGHT, MR. POOH BEAR,

35:08.230 --> 35:10.027
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE
DISCUSSED IN THE CAR ?

35:10.030 --> 35:12.089
WE'RE GONNA USE OUR
VERY BEST MANNERS TONIGHT.

35:12.100 --> 35:15.752
SWEETIE PIE.

35:16.700 --> 35:17.894
PLEASE.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.027
SO, HOW'S
THE PRESS TOUR GOING ?

35:20.030 --> 35:22.590
OH, GOD, I FEEL LIKE
SUCH A SELL-OUT.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.818
I ACTUALLY DID
"POLITICALLY INCORRECT"
LAST NIGHT.

35:24.830 --> 35:26.229
WOW, WAS IT FUN ?

35:26.230 --> 35:29.028
OH, HARDLY, IT WAS ME,
KOBE BRYANT,

35:29.030 --> 35:31.692
THAT EMACIATED CHICK
FROM "THE PRACTICE"

35:31.700 --> 35:33.588
AND SOME 12-YEAR-OLD
RAP SINGER

35:33.600 --> 35:34.919
THAT I'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF.

35:34.930 --> 35:37.626
I READ
YOUR FIRST BOOK.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.393
I THOUGHT
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.799
THANK YOU.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.950
I COULD SEND YOU A COPY OF
THE NEW ONE, IF YOU'D LIKE.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.552
I WOULD,
THANK YOU.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.824
YOU KNOW, I READ
"CHARLOTTE, LIGHT AND DARK".

35:46.830 --> 35:48.923
OH, DEAR.

35:48.930 --> 35:50.488
WHY ?

35:50.500 --> 35:51.990
IN GRAD SCHOOL.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.558
I HAD THIS
IDIOT PROFESSOR

35:53.560 --> 35:55.824
WHO INSISTED THAT IT WAS
THE PERFECT PROFILE

35:55.830 --> 35:58.321
OF A CLASSIC
BORDERLINE PERSONALITY.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.697
YOU'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE, RIGHT ?

36:01.700 --> 36:05.625
I ACTUALLY WENT TO THE LIBRARY
AND LOOKED UP THE SYMPTOMS

36:05.630 --> 36:08.349
AND STARTED BEHAVING LIKE THAT,
JUST TO FUCK WITH THEM.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.657
SERIOUSLY ?

36:09.660 --> 36:11.389
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.924
HOW OLD WERE YOU ?

36:12.930 --> 36:15.091
AH, MUST'VE BEEN
NINE OR 10.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.624
IT WAS TOWARD
THE END.

36:16.630 --> 36:18.825
PERSONALLY, I THINK
IT'S A CROCK OF SHIT.

36:18.830 --> 36:20.229
DID YOU EVER NOTICE

36:20.230 --> 36:22.198
HOW THE MAJORITY
OF BORDERLINES ARE WOMEN ?

36:22.200 --> 36:25.954
I SEE IT AS JUST A MISOGYNISTIC
ATTEMPT TO PATHOLOGIZE WOMEN

36:25.960 --> 36:28.690
WHO REFUSE TO
TOE THE PATRIARCHAL LINE.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.527
YEAH, YEAH,

36:31.530 --> 36:34.192
I SPENT SIX MONTHS IN SEATTLE
ON A TEACHING FELLOWSHIP.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.191
YOU EVER DO
ANY CLIMBING THERE ?

36:36.200 --> 36:37.519
OH, YEAH,

36:37.530 --> 36:39.225
SOME BOULDERING,
NO REAL CLIMBING WITH ROPES.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.596
WERE YOU A CRAGGER ?

36:41.600 --> 36:44.228
EH, THE RANK AMATEUR
URBAN KIND.

36:44.230 --> 36:45.629
BUT I DO LOVE IT.

36:45.630 --> 36:48.121
HAVE YOU DONE
THE U-DUB CLIMBING ROCK ?

36:48.130 --> 36:49.449
YEAH, THAT'S
WHERE I LEARNED.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.599
I NEVER KNEW 30 FEET
WAS SO HIGH OFF THE GROUND.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.398
30 FEET,
THAT'S NOTHING.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.449
I GOT A COUPLE BUDDIES,
THEY'RE REAL THRILL-SEEKERS,

36:57.460 --> 36:58.893
I MEAN,
THEY CLIMB HIGH, BUT...

36:58.900 --> 37:01.653
NO WAY
I CAN DO THAT.

37:02.830 --> 37:05.719
GOTTA THINK ABOUT
MORE THAN JUST MYSELF NOW.

37:11.860 --> 37:13.657
BREN LOOKS GREAT.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.857
HOW'S SHE DOING ?

37:16.860 --> 37:18.350
OH, SHE'S DOING GREAT.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.658
MAN, SHE IS
SO FUCKING SMART.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.025
YEAH, SHE IS.

37:22.030 --> 37:24.726
SHE USED TO RUN
CIRCLES AROUND ME,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

37:24.730 --> 37:28.848
EVERYBODY EXPECTED
SUCH GREAT THINGS FROM HER.

37:32.700 --> 37:34.292
HOW'S HER BROTHER ?

37:34.300 --> 37:38.327
HE'S IN
A HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.027
( Brenda )
I JUST REALLY WANTED
TO GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

37:54.030 --> 37:56.999
SO, I TOOK
18 MONTHS OF CLASSES

37:57.000 --> 37:58.456
DOWN AT
THE SHIATSU INSTITUTE,

37:58.460 --> 38:00.496
THINKING I'D DO IT
UNTIL I FIGURED OUT

38:00.500 --> 38:02.149
WHAT I REALLY
WANTED TO DO,

38:02.160 --> 38:04.299
AND HERE WE ARE
10 YEARS LATER.

38:04.300 --> 38:06.325
BUT YOU LOVE
WHAT YOU DO, RIGHT ?

38:06.330 --> 38:08.093
( Brenda )
I DO.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.158
( Trevor )
THAT'S THE KEY,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

38:09.160 --> 38:11.128
THERE IS THIS GIRL
IN MY HEALTH CLUB,

38:11.130 --> 38:12.791
SHE DOESN'T
DO SHIATSU,

38:12.800 --> 38:15.121
BUT I SWEAR,
SHE IS GIFTED.

38:15.130 --> 38:16.495
GIFT-ED.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.298
YOU KNOW, THERE IS
A SCIENCE TO SHIATSU.

38:19.300 --> 38:22.997
CHINESE MEDICINE DATES BACK
OVER 2,000 YEARS.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.552
THIS IS
DELICIOUS, BRENDA.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.391
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER COOK LIKE THIS.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.595
I CAN MAKE PASTA,
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.022
SHE'S GOT ME BEAT,
THOUGH.

38:34.030 --> 38:35.099
I CAN MAKE TOAST.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.419
AND ICE CUBES.

38:36.430 --> 38:38.421
NATE DOES PRETTY GOOD
MICROWAVE POPCORN.

38:38.430 --> 38:40.398
WHAT DO YOU DO, NATE ?

38:40.400 --> 38:43.892
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.357
REALLY ?

38:49.460 --> 38:50.427
HUH.

38:50.430 --> 38:51.692
WHAT...

38:52.760 --> 38:55.752
WHAT MAKES ONE DECIDE
TO BECOME A FUNERAL DIRECTOR ?

38:57.100 --> 38:58.954
WELL, I WAS
BORN INTO IT, ACTUALLY.

38:58.960 --> 39:02.794
SORT OF LIKE BEING BORN
INTO THE MAFIA.

39:07.660 --> 39:08.888
WOW.

39:11.730 --> 39:14.221
OH, HEY, NOT SO
FAST THERE, HOTSHOT.

39:14.230 --> 39:16.152
THIS IS
A TOLL ROAD.

39:34.530 --> 39:36.657
(Will screaming )

39:37.800 --> 39:39.654
( Trevor )
WILL, WILL !

39:39.660 --> 39:40.854
TIME OUT.

39:40.860 --> 39:43.351
SOMETIMES HE BECOMES
COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL,

39:43.360 --> 39:45.191
JUST TO GET ATTENTION.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.258
HELL,

39:46.260 --> 39:48.057
SOMETIMES I DO THAT.

39:54.330 --> 39:55.558
( knocking )

39:55.560 --> 39:58.051
UNCLE K !

39:58.060 --> 40:00.824
HEY, BABY GIRL,
HAPPY BIRTH DAY.

40:00.830 --> 40:02.593
I'M NINE.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.420
OH, WELL,
I GUESS THAT MEANS

40:04.430 --> 40:05.897
I CAN'T CALL YOU
"BABY GIRL" ANYMORE.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.197
YOU BETTER NOT.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.122
THIS IS
MY FRIEND, DAVID.

40:09.130 --> 40:10.392
HI, THERE.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.049
HI.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.493
SO, WHERE'S
THE PARTY ?

40:32.560 --> 40:35.199
YOU WANT SOME ?
IT'S GOOD.

40:36.630 --> 40:38.393
THIS IS FOR YOU,
SWEETHEART.

40:44.930 --> 40:47.148
I SAW THIS
IN THE STORE !

40:47.160 --> 40:48.991
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY STILL MAKE THESE.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.627
I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE IT.

40:50.630 --> 40:52.848
THAN KS, UNCLE K.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.024
WHERE'S MOMMY ?

40:58.030 --> 40:59.725
IN THE BEDROOM,
SLEEPING.

40:59.730 --> 41:03.427
I AM GONNA GO AND TALK TO HER
FOR A LITTLE BIT, ALRIGHT ?

41:03.430 --> 41:04.829
OKAY.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.257
KARLA. ..

41:31.530 --> 41:33.327
KARLA !

41:37.800 --> 41:39.859
OH, HI.

41:39.860 --> 41:42.522
I THOUGHT YOU WASN'T
COMING TILL LATER.

41:42.530 --> 41:44.088
IT IS LATER.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.352
WHAT HAPPENED TO
TAYLOR'S BIRTH DAY PARTY ?

41:46.360 --> 41:48.726
OH, SHIT.

41:48.730 --> 41:52.188
I GOT HOME FROM WORK
AND WAS BONE TIRED.

41:52.200 --> 41:55.499
I'LL TAKE HER TO
A FLEA MARKET ON THE WEEKEND,

41:55.500 --> 41:56.899
GET HER SOMETHING.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.049
THAT'S ALL YOU DID
FOR HER BIRTHDAY ?

41:58.060 --> 41:59.425
BUY HER
AN ENTENMANN'S CAKE ?!

41:59.430 --> 42:01.227
IT'S HER FAVORITE.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.993
WHAT ARE YOU ON ?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.126
DON'T LIE TO ME !

42:09.130 --> 42:10.722
I AIN'T
ON NOTHING, OKAY ?

42:10.730 --> 42:12.857
WHAT, YOU THINK I'M SUICIDAL,
OR JUST PLAIN STUPID ?

42:12.860 --> 42:14.589
I THINK YOU NEED TO STOP
LIVING JUST FOR YOURSELF,

42:14.600 --> 42:16.989
AND START THINKING ABOUT
THAT LITTLE GIRL IN THERE !

42:17.000 --> 42:18.297
IAM SEVEN MONTHS CLEAN !

42:18.300 --> 42:20.359
I WORK TWO JOBS
AND TAKE CARE OF MY KID.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.897
WHAT, I FORGOT
A MOTHERFUCKIN' BIRTHDAY.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.151
YOU WANT TO
ARREST ME FOR THAT ?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.855
LOOK, YOU CAN DO ALL THE DAMAGE
YOU WANT TO YOURSELF,

42:25.860 --> 42:27.623
I CAN'T STOP THAT !

42:27.630 --> 42:29.450
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU FUCK UP HER LIFE !

42:29.460 --> 42:31.724
TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF ME.

42:31.730 --> 42:32.822
KARLA--

42:32.830 --> 42:34.024
I WILL FILE
AN ASSAULT CHARGE,

42:34.030 --> 42:35.918
AND YOU DO NOT
WANT THAT.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.258
MY SISTER HAD ONE OF THESE
WHEN SHE WAS A KID,

42:43.260 --> 42:44.818
BUT I BROKE IT.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.821
ON PURPOSE ?

42:46.830 --> 42:49.390
NO, I WANTED
TO MAKE A PIZZA,

42:49.400 --> 42:52.324
AND I PUT IN
A 300-WATT BULB

42:52.330 --> 42:53.649
AND THE WHOLE
THING MELTED.

42:53.660 --> 42:55.127
THAT'S DUMB.

42:55.130 --> 42:57.690
I KNOW,
AND I WAS 17.

42:57.700 --> 43:01.295
( Keith )
YOU DON'T GIVE
A FUCK ABOUT HER I

43:06.460 --> 43:08.758
YOU LIVE
IN A HOUSE ?

43:08.760 --> 43:10.057
YUP.

43:10.060 --> 43:12.597
A BIG HOUSE ?

43:12.600 --> 43:15.023
NOT THAT BIG.

43:17.030 --> 43:18.497
YOU GOT A DADDY ?

43:18.500 --> 43:21.298
I USED TO.

43:22.230 --> 43:23.788
( door opening )

43:27.460 --> 43:30.293
UM, WE GOTTA GO,
OKAY ?

43:30.300 --> 43:31.619
OKAY.

43:31.630 --> 43:32.699
ALRIGHT, LISTEN...

43:32.700 --> 43:34.952
I'LL COME BACK
TOMORROW.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.621
AS SOON AS
I GET OFF OF WORK,

43:36.630 --> 43:38.257
AND WE'LL GO
TO THE MOVIES, OKAY ?

43:38.260 --> 43:40.148
OKAY.

43:47.630 --> 43:49.291
WE GOTTA GO.

44:00.430 --> 44:04.059
( Brenda )
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT WAS I THINKING ?

44:04.060 --> 44:07.188
WELL, I WAS ONLY 19.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.919
COME ON,
HE WASN'T THAT BAD.

44:09.930 --> 44:13.388
"THERE IS THIS GIRL
AT MY HEALTH CLUB,

44:13.400 --> 44:15.618
SHE IS GIFT-ED."

44:15.630 --> 44:17.359
GIFT-ED.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.827
WHAT A DORK.

44:18.830 --> 44:21.196
HIS EARS WERE FILTHY,
DID YOU NOTICE THAT ?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.292
NO.

44:22.300 --> 44:24.097
NOW, HER,
I LIKED.

44:24.100 --> 44:26.056
THAT KID,
WHAT A FREAK.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.425
OH!

44:27.430 --> 44:29.455
START SAVING UP
FOR THERAPY NOW.

44:29.460 --> 44:32.429
WE NEED
SOME FRIENDS.

44:32.430 --> 44:34.523
SOME COUPLES
WE DON'T HATE.

44:34.530 --> 44:36.953
WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.754
MAYBE WE SHOULD
VOLUNTEER SOMEPLACE.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.195
NO, I'M SERIOUS,

44:47.200 --> 44:48.952
DO SOMETHING GOOD
FOR THE WORLD.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.929
A NEEDLE EXCHANGE
PROGRAM,

44:51.930 --> 44:55.627
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY,
MEALS ON WHEELS.

44:55.630 --> 44:59.691
GIVE MORE,
CONSUME LESS.

45:01.130 --> 45:03.291
BRENDA, I'M DYING.

45:03.300 --> 45:04.892
WHAT ?

45:04.900 --> 45:07.118
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

45:07.130 --> 45:08.620
AFTER THE AUTO ACCIDENT,

45:08.630 --> 45:12.794
I HAD X-RAYS, MRIs,
AND THEY FOUND SOMETHING.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.521
THEY FOUND,
IT'S CALLED AVM,

45:16.530 --> 45:18.293
AND I THINK
I'M GONNA DIE FROM IT,
I DON'T KNOW WHEN.

45:23.330 --> 45:25.321
I'M SO SCARED.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.591
ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME ?

45:32.600 --> 45:33.897
YEAH,

45:33.900 --> 45:36.357
YEAH,
MEALS ON WHEELS.

45:36.360 --> 45:39.022
YOU REALLY
WANT TO DO THAT ?

45:39.030 --> 45:41.828
I DON'T KNOW,
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

45:41.830 --> 45:44.799
I HATE
MY FUCKING LIFE.

45:44.800 --> 45:46.597
WHAT'S WRONG ?

45:46.600 --> 45:50.627
I WAS WATCHING
TREVOR AND DAWN TONIGHT...

45:51.930 --> 45:53.921
THINKING
THEY'RE JUST SO,

45:53.930 --> 45:57.127
SO, SO COMPLETE.

45:58.260 --> 46:00.558
THEY HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I WILL NEVER HAVE,

46:00.560 --> 46:02.027
EVER.

46:02.030 --> 46:05.522
EITHER I WASN'T BORN WITH IT
OR IT WAS BEATEN OUT OF ME,

46:05.530 --> 46:07.088
OR MAYBE, MAYBE,

46:07.100 --> 46:09.853
I MADE MYSELF INTO
A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

46:09.860 --> 46:12.158
AND I REALLY AM
A BORDERLINE PERSONALITY.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.196
NOW, WOULDN'T
THAT BE IRONIC ?

46:16.160 --> 46:17.991
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU ?

46:19.760 --> 46:21.421
I DON'T KNOW.

46:23.100 --> 46:25.660
I'VE SPENT MY CHILDHOOD
PERFORMING FOR CLINICIANS,

46:25.660 --> 46:28.823
THE REST OF MY LIFE TAKING CARE
OF MY TRAIN WRECK OF A BROTHER,

46:28.830 --> 46:32.755
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO I AM.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.558
I'M GONNA MAKE A CUP OF TEA,
YOU WANT ONE ?

46:40.330 --> 46:41.991
NO, THANKS.

46:53.160 --> 46:55.628
( David )
GOD, I CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL OUR NEXT FUNERAL i

46:55.630 --> 46:57.689
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, MOM ?

46:57.700 --> 47:00.419
IT'S VERY MODERN.

47:00.430 --> 47:03.149
WE FIGURE IT'LL PAY FOR ITSELF
IN LESS THAN EIGHT MONTHS.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.799
WHAT DID
WE SPEND ON THIS ?

47:07.500 --> 47:09.297
ABOUT
20 THOUSAND ?

47:09.300 --> 47:13.293
HOW MUCH IS LEFT IN
THE RESERVE FUND I GAVE YOU ?

47:13.300 --> 47:15.188
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.454
I WANT A FULL ACCOUNTING OF
HOW YOU SPENT THAT 93 THOUSAND.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.553
I'M AN INVESTOR
IN FISHER AND SONS.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.027
THAT WALL IS PART
OF MY INVESTMENT,

47:22.030 --> 47:23.691
AND I EXPECT A RETURN.

47:23.700 --> 47:24.894
WELL, OF COURSE, MOM.

47:24.900 --> 47:27.596
I AM SPEAKING
FIERCELY FROM THE "I".

47:27.600 --> 47:30.353
DO YOU MIND ?!

47:35.300 --> 47:38.121
I JUST NEED ONE OF YOU
TO SIGN RIGHT HERE

47:38.130 --> 47:39.825
AND WE'LL BE DONE.

47:39.830 --> 47:42.219
DO WE NEED TO WRITE
YOU A CHECK RIGHT NOW,

47:42.230 --> 47:43.652
OR COULD WE JUST MAIL ONE
TO YOUR OFFICE ?

47:43.660 --> 47:44.729
UH...

47:44.730 --> 47:46.550
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
OPEN THIS FIRST.

47:47.630 --> 47:50.121
CAME OUT GOOD, HUH ?

47:50.130 --> 47:51.825
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S GREAT.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.656
"ENJOY THE NEW CASKET WALL,
IT'S ON ME.

47:58.660 --> 48:01.424
KISSES,
MITZI DALTON HUNTLEY."

48:01.430 --> 48:03.227
WHY WOULD SHE
PAY FOR OUR WALL ?

48:03.230 --> 48:04.549
SHE DIDN'T PAY FOR IT.

48:04.560 --> 48:06.596
APPLEBY CASKETS
IS OWNED BY KROEHNER.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.852
SINCE WHEN ?

48:08.860 --> 48:10.191
SINCE THREE WEEKS AGO.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.395
ENJOY.

48:16.030 --> 48:18.897
SHE HAS US SELLING
KROEHNER CASKETS.

48:18.900 --> 48:20.026
WOW.

48:20.030 --> 48:21.452
SHE'S GOOD.

48:21.460 --> 48:24.588
WELL, I GUESS WE CAN AT LEAST
HELP OUT RICO NOW.

48:24.600 --> 48:27.091
YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

48:27.100 --> 48:29.227
THEN WE GO UNDER
AND HE'S OUT OF WORK

48:29.230 --> 48:30.652
AND CAN'T AFFORD
TO PAY US BACK,

48:30.660 --> 48:32.924
WHICH WON'T MATTER,
BECAUSE WE WON'T EXIST ANYMORE.

48:32.930 --> 48:34.056
DAVID.

48:34.060 --> 48:35.322
WE JUST SAVED
20 GRAND.

48:35.330 --> 48:39.152
WE DIDN'T SAVE 20 GRAND,
WE JUST DIDN'T SPEND IT.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.754
ACTUALLY, WE JUST
LOST 16 HUNDRED,

48:41.760 --> 48:43.352
BECAUSE WE HAD TO
GIVE THE LANGMEADS

48:43.360 --> 48:46.818
THE HAVEN FOUR FOR AN EVEN 10,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

48:55.730 --> 48:57.857
HONEY, OF COURSE
I LOVE THE HOUSE,

48:57.860 --> 48:59.157
BUT BELIEVE ME,

48:59.160 --> 49:00.855
THEY ARE NEVER
GONNA GIVE US THE MONEY.

49:00.860 --> 49:02.521
YOU LOVE
THE HOUSE, THOUGH.

49:02.530 --> 49:05.192
WE JUST HAVE TO
KEEP ON LOOKING, BABY.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.497
NO, WE DON'T.

49:06.500 --> 49:07.797
I WENT TO THE REALTOR
THIS MORNING

49:07.800 --> 49:09.153
AND WE GOT
THE HOUSE.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.559
I WROTE A CHECK
FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.221
NOW JULIO CAN
HAVE HIS OWN ROOM.

49:12.230 --> 49:15.893
WHERE'D YOU GET THE MONEY ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

49:15.900 --> 49:19.051
OKAY, DON'T BE MAD.

49:29.100 --> 49:31.751
YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK
AND ASKED YOUR SISTER
FOR THE MONEY ?

49:31.760 --> 49:32.795
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

49:32.800 --> 49:34.449
RICO, I WASN'T ABOUT
TO LOSE THAT HOUSE.

49:34.460 --> 49:36.758
I PROVIDE FOR THIS FAMILY,
NOT HER !

49:36.760 --> 49:39.490
I'M GONE EIGHT TO 10 HOURS
A DAY, MISSING MY KIDS,

49:39.500 --> 49:40.751
TO GET US
WHAT WE NEED !

49:40.760 --> 49:42.591
I DON'T NEED
HER FUCKING HANDOUTS !

49:42.600 --> 49:45.489
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
MACHISMO BULLSHIT TODAY, OKAY ?

49:48.430 --> 49:50.318
WHAT DID
YOU SAY TO ME ?

49:54.400 --> 49:56.049
BABY...

49:56.060 --> 49:57.823
WE HAVE A HOUSE.

49:57.830 --> 50:00.492
IT'S OUR FIRST HOUSE.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.923
CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY ?

50:02.930 --> 50:05.649
I'M CANCELING
THAT CHECK.

50:05.660 --> 50:07.252
LISTEN TO ME.

50:07.260 --> 50:09.296
WHEN THE TRANSMISSION
WENT LAST MONTH,

50:09.300 --> 50:10.858
WHERE'D THE MONEY
COME FROM ?

50:10.860 --> 50:13.420
WHEN I CHIPPED MY TOOTH
AND WE COULDN'T
AFFORD THE DENTIST,

50:13.430 --> 50:14.829
WHO PAID FOR IT ?

50:14.830 --> 50:17.321
ANGELICA'S DOING GOOD,
SHE HAS EXTRA MONEY.

50:17.330 --> 50:18.888
SHE'S FAMILY.

50:18.900 --> 50:21.198
SHE LOVES US,
SHE WANTS TO HELP US.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.294
SO, PLEASE...

50:26.100 --> 50:28.159
PUT DOWN THE PHONE.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.659
WE HAVE A HOUSE.

50:44.430 --> 50:46.648
EVERYTHING IS GOOD.

51:01.430 --> 51:02.692
HEY.

51:02.700 --> 51:05.123
I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU ALL DAY.

51:06.930 --> 51:08.227
HOW'S ANDY ?

51:09.660 --> 51:11.719
HE'S GONNA
BE OKAY.

51:13.030 --> 51:14.918
WHAT WAS HE ON ?

51:14.930 --> 51:17.694
SOME WEIRD SHIT,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

51:21.300 --> 51:23.495
DIPPED IN
EMBALMING FLUID.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.558
YEAH,
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

51:26.560 --> 51:27.891
THAT WOULDN'T BE
EMBALMING FLUID

51:27.900 --> 51:29.652

51:29.660 --> 51:33.357
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH YOU ?!

51:33.360 --> 51:36.090
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
THIS COULD GET US IN ?

51:36.100 --> 51:38.352
I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,
HE COULD'VE DIED.

51:38.360 --> 51:41.158
AND MY BROTHERS COULD BE
GETTING A FUCKING PHONE CALL

51:41.160 --> 51:42.923
FROM THE COPS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?

51:42.930 --> 51:44.090

51:45.400 --> 51:49.097

FIVE FRY STICKS TO SELL,

51:49.100 --> 51:51.625

51:51.630 --> 51:54.190
I AM SORRY

51:54.200 --> 51:56.919
BUT YOU TOOK ME DOWN THERE
AND I SAW THE STUFF,

51:56.930 --> 51:58.329

WASN'T THINKING.

51:58.330 --> 51:59.524
OH, YOU WERE THINKING.

51:59.530 --> 52:01.054
YOU WERE THINKING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

52:01.060 --> 52:04.518
CLAIRE, LISTEN TO ME,
LISTEN TO ME.

52:04.530 --> 52:06.088

52:09.030 --> 52:10.759

CONVENIENCE STORE.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.955
AND NOW I'M WORRIED THAT
ANDY'S GONNA TURN ME IN.

52:17.960 --> 52:20.099

52:22.960 --> 52:27.090
EVERYTHING I TOUCH
TURNS TO SHIT.

52:29.900 --> 52:32.027
EVERYTHING

52:34.260 --> 52:36.922
EVERYBODY WAS
RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.926
YOU ARE THE ONLY GOOD THING
THAT I HAVE LEFT.

52:40.930 --> 52:42.898
PLEASE DON'T
GIVE UP ON ME.

52:45.060 --> 52:46.857
PLEASE.

52:51.730 --> 52:53.322

53:11.860 --> 53:14.658
( sobbing )

53:18.900 --> 53:21.323
AW, CHRIST.

53:22.960 --> 53:25.349

STARTING TO PISS ME OFF !

53:26.800 --> 53:27.949

54:35.900 --> 54:37.652
YOU'RE DONE
WITH YOUR RUN ALREADY ?

54:37.660 --> 54:39.298
UH, I DIDN'T NEED IT.

54:39.300 --> 54:41.928
WELL, THE LANGMEAD VIEWING
IS AT SIX.

54:41.930 --> 54:43.090
YOU'RE READY, RIGHT ?

54:43.100 --> 54:44.158

I NEED TO--

54:44.160 --> 54:45.855

54:45.860 --> 54:48.328
WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE NOW ?

54:52.960 --> 54:55.599

LISTEN, IF I'VE BEEN
A DICK OR SOMETHING,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

55:20.760 --> 55:26.426
I FOUND OUT THAT I HAVE
A CONDITION CALLED AVM.

55:30.030 --> 55:32.396
IT BASICALLY MEANS THAT I COULD
HAVE A STROKE OR ANEURYSM

55:32.400 --> 55:34.220
JUST ABOUT
ANY TIME.

55:37.130 --> 55:39.758
( sobbing )
I'M NOT COPING WITH THIS
VERY WELL...

55:42.500 --> 55:45.856
