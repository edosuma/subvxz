WEBVTT

00:05.618 --> 00:07.846
Previously on "Masters of Sex"...

00:07.846 --> 00:09.748
We were just discussing your friend Keith

00:09.749 --> 00:13.018
and the possibility of finding
him a surrogate partner.

00:13.019 --> 00:15.487
You want to boff somebody from Mr.
Taybor's drama class?

00:15.488 --> 00:17.489
- I want to help!
- I checked it out.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.691
I went to three different adoption clinics,

00:19.692 --> 00:22.294
they do not let single women adopt.
I'm sorry.

00:22.295 --> 00:24.963
But I want a baby. I want a baby so bad.

00:24.964 --> 00:26.331
Can I help you ladies?

00:26.332 --> 00:29.501
We have a favor to ask.

00:29.502 --> 00:31.470
The sergeant and I have discussed this,

00:31.471 --> 00:32.971
and I want to do this now.

00:32.972 --> 00:34.640
You want to do...?

00:34.641 --> 00:35.774
To enlist.

00:35.775 --> 00:37.776
Henry promised me

00:37.777 --> 00:39.878
that he would not take a combat position.

00:39.879 --> 00:41.246
We had a deal.

00:41.247 --> 00:43.682
You know what a soldier does?
He gets through the day.

00:43.683 --> 00:45.384
That's how I got through the war.

00:45.385 --> 00:47.252
That's how your son's
getting through the war.

00:47.253 --> 00:48.754
I cannot begin to apologize

00:48.755 --> 00:50.326
for telling you what I knew about joy.

00:50.327 --> 00:51.560
These past few months,

00:51.561 --> 00:54.029
all I have wanted to see come
through that door is you.

00:54.030 --> 00:55.764
That's the only thing I
had to look forward to.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.666
That was it.

00:57.667 --> 01:00.703
Our science, with Mr. Logan's commerce,

01:00.704 --> 01:03.272
is creating a happy marriage.

01:03.273 --> 01:07.009
You're a woman who deserves
more than coffee in some lobby.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.078
What we might call a proper courtship.

01:09.079 --> 01:11.447
Dan Logan's study has reached a dead end.

01:11.448 --> 01:15.050
Time for Dan Logan to go back to New York.

Is the cough in your throat or your chest?

02:06.202 --> 02:08.169
A little bit of both.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.771
Have you taken your temperature?

02:11.141 --> 02:14.309
It was 101 when I woke up this morning,

02:14.310 --> 02:15.611
but that was over an hour ago.

02:15.612 --> 02:17.546
And I-I feel a thousand times better now.

02:18.782 --> 02:21.083
Excuse me. I think it'll be fine
as soon as I get out of bed.

02:21.084 --> 02:22.451
You're not coming in today.

02:22.452 --> 02:26.088
But we still need to review
the surrogate material.

02:27.457 --> 02:30.192
You can come over tonight if you want,

02:30.193 --> 02:32.661
and we can discuss it then,
but I have to warn you,

02:32.662 --> 02:34.763
I continue to have the same objections.

02:34.764 --> 02:37.633
Well, let's push that
conversation to next week.

02:37.634 --> 02:39.368
Or tomorrow.

02:39.369 --> 02:41.036
No, you're not coming in tomorrow, either.

02:41.037 --> 02:44.673
The flu takes at least 48 hours
to work through your system.

02:44.674 --> 02:46.241
Besides, it's already Thursday.

02:46.242 --> 02:48.777
This way you can take the
weekend to recuperate.

02:48.778 --> 02:52.648
If you really think that's best.

02:52.649 --> 02:55.451
I've already sent the girls to George's

02:55.452 --> 02:57.553
so they don't come down with this.

02:57.554 --> 02:59.254
I might even take the phone off the hook,

02:59.255 --> 03:00.556
try to get some more sleep.

03:00.557 --> 03:03.692
Good, and make sure you
drink plenty of fluids.

03:03.693 --> 03:07.130
Aspirin every four hours for the fever.

03:15.772 --> 03:17.573
I must say, it's a bit troubling

03:17.574 --> 03:19.308
how good you are at that.

03:20.643 --> 03:23.612
How did the good doctor take it?

03:23.613 --> 03:26.081
Surprisingly well.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.483
So, to get out of work,

03:27.484 --> 03:31.787
you called and argued why
you should come in to work?

03:31.788 --> 03:33.122
It's important

03:33.123 --> 03:35.457
for Bill to think that it was his idea.

03:36.726 --> 03:38.293
Well, I'm telling you,

03:38.294 --> 03:41.363
this dry desert climate is
just the thing for you.

03:41.364 --> 03:44.133
I've never done anything like this before.

03:44.134 --> 03:46.135
- What? Call in sick?
- No.

03:46.136 --> 03:50.572
Dropped everything at a moment's
notice to jump on an airplane.

03:50.573 --> 03:53.408
You deserve the day off.

03:53.409 --> 03:55.210
When was the last time that happened?

03:55.211 --> 03:58.147
I think dinosaurs roamed the Earth.

04:03.753 --> 04:05.788
Nervous?

04:05.789 --> 04:07.222
It's a big swing.

04:07.223 --> 04:11.260
Casino owners... a long-term
business strategy for them

04:11.261 --> 04:12.761
extends about as far as next week.

04:12.762 --> 04:15.297
All you have to do is explain to them

04:15.298 --> 04:18.132
that this is a simple, practical idea.

04:18.134 --> 04:20.435
Well, and soon everyone will be doing it.

04:20.435 --> 04:22.304
Just imagine supermarkets

04:22.305 --> 04:25.507
pumping the scent of fresh
bread into the aisles.

04:25.508 --> 04:27.743
What smell do you pump into a casino?

04:27.744 --> 04:29.512
Crisp dollar bills?

04:41.591 --> 04:42.691
Okay.

04:42.692 --> 04:45.394
I will, pick you up at lunch.

04:48.164 --> 04:49.698
You just keep thinking about
what you want to eat.

04:49.699 --> 04:52.367
Why don't we just stick to room service?

04:56.706 --> 04:59.174
I'll be back by 2:00.

04:59.175 --> 05:00.309
By 2:00?

05:00.310 --> 05:04.179
But that's six hours from now.

05:04.180 --> 05:05.447
I didn't bring any work with me.

05:05.448 --> 05:07.549
That's good. That's the whole
point of getting away.

05:07.550 --> 05:10.352
What am I supposed to do all morning?

05:10.353 --> 05:13.288
Well, I believe the technical
term is "relaxing,"

05:13.289 --> 05:14.590
which I know you will refuse to do,

05:14.591 --> 05:18.093
so I've made an appointment for
you to have a Swedish massage.

05:18.094 --> 05:21.196
Now, Hilda will be here in
15 minutes with her table.

05:21.197 --> 05:23.765
Then you have an appointment
at Duvall's Boutique,

05:23.766 --> 05:25.300
where Clarissa will help you

05:25.301 --> 05:27.369
pick out a nice, beautiful
dress for this evening.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.404
And afterwards, the
beauty parlor downstairs

05:29.405 --> 05:31.106
will be expecting you.

05:31.107 --> 05:33.075
I...

05:33.076 --> 05:36.511
I would really rather not.

05:36.512 --> 05:38.514
It's already been paid for.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.686
You're on vacation.

05:44.687 --> 05:46.723
Try having fun.

06:12.015 --> 06:13.382
Good morning. How may I help you?

06:13.383 --> 06:14.683
Yes, is this the concierge?

06:14.684 --> 06:16.118
Yes, ma'am. It is.

06:16.119 --> 06:18.287
Hello. I need to cancel an appointment...

06:18.288 --> 06:20.555
Several of them, actually.

06:20.556 --> 06:23.425
Turns out 40 gals
participated in the sex study

06:23.426 --> 06:25.494
at least three times
with different partners.

06:25.495 --> 06:27.729
I call them the overachievers.

06:27.730 --> 06:29.197
And you've contacted them all?

06:29.198 --> 06:30.299
Tried my best.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.733
Cross-outs, I either couldn't get ahold of

06:31.734 --> 06:33.135
or they weren't interested,

06:33.136 --> 06:35.437
and everybody else on the list is a maybe.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.606
And you've explained

06:37.607 --> 06:39.675
what surrogacy work would involve?

06:39.676 --> 06:42.010
In mind-numbingly dull detail,

06:42.011 --> 06:43.612
just the way you like it.

06:43.613 --> 06:46.214
I'd like you to arrange
interviews for this afternoon.

06:46.215 --> 06:48.517
This afternoon as in today this afternoon?

06:48.518 --> 06:50.319
Well, we need to get this
program up and running

06:50.320 --> 06:52.587
as soon as possible to meet the demand.

06:52.588 --> 06:55.590
You do know Virginia's out
for the rest of the day?

06:55.591 --> 06:57.225
And the way she was hacking
a lung on the phone,

06:57.226 --> 06:58.427
I doubt she'll be back tomorrow, either.

06:58.428 --> 07:00.095
She'll be returning on Monday.

07:00.096 --> 07:02.264
Virginia and I talked about
the surrogacy business

07:02.265 --> 07:05.200
last week, and she didn't sound
exactly full steam ahead.

07:05.201 --> 07:07.069
Well, it's a brand-new field of inquiry.

07:07.070 --> 07:10.439
It's only proper that she would
have questions about it.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.140
She wasn't even sure if it was legal.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.709
Paying these ladies to
have sex with strangers

07:13.710 --> 07:15.477
sounds an awful lot like something else.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.145
Hence, we're not paying the women.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.313
It's volunteer only.

07:18.314 --> 07:19.748
That wasn't her only problem with it.

07:19.749 --> 07:21.183
We can't continue to debate

07:21.184 --> 07:23.552
a purely hypothetical program.

07:23.553 --> 07:27.723
We need to put the pieces in
place so when Virginia is back,

07:27.724 --> 07:31.724
she can weigh the merits of
the idea in practical terms.

07:32.261 --> 07:34.229
You're doing an end run around her.

07:34.230 --> 07:35.430
Just make the calls.

07:35.431 --> 07:38.100
Your first fertility patient is here.

07:38.101 --> 07:39.401
Husband looks familiar.

07:39.402 --> 07:42.170
Bill, it's wonderful to see you.

07:42.171 --> 07:45.640
Um, allow me to introduce my wife, Celeste.

07:45.641 --> 07:48.010
Last time I saw you,

07:48.011 --> 07:51.046
you were still selling diet
pills across the hall.

07:51.047 --> 07:52.681
Has it been that long?

07:52.682 --> 07:55.117
Well, after a few years at Cal-o-metric,

07:55.118 --> 07:57.519
I felt like I needed a... a new challenge.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.189
I was able to parlay my success
there into a leadership position

08:01.190 --> 08:04.259
with an exciting young company
called Della's Diets.

08:04.260 --> 08:06.361
We were huge in 1963.

08:06.362 --> 08:09.031
And in many ways, we were
victims of our own success.

08:09.032 --> 08:11.266
Six lawsuits, three audits,

08:11.267 --> 08:12.768
one criminal investigation

08:12.769 --> 08:14.770
by the state of Missouri
into Della's Diets.

08:14.771 --> 08:17.272
I'm lucky I escaped with
my medical license.

08:17.273 --> 08:19.408
Making "false" claims.

08:19.409 --> 08:21.309
Well, obviously, I wouldn't have made them

08:21.310 --> 08:22.411
if I'd known they were false.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.546
And then there's my
real-estate investments.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.114
Real-estate investments?

08:26.115 --> 08:27.215
On the side.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.550
It's more of a hobby, really.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.552
He's got a great nose for property.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.054
The single worst decision I ever made...

08:33.056 --> 08:34.256
Buying this place.

08:34.256 --> 08:37.092
And I've made some bad decisions.

08:37.794 --> 08:39.794
Two weeks after I sign the papers,

08:39.796 --> 08:41.129
we lose our liquor license.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.131
The owner forgot to pay his bribes on time.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.801
Turns out, not many people
want to enjoy a lap dance

08:45.802 --> 08:49.404
with a cold glass of apple juice.

08:49.405 --> 08:51.373
A lot of the dancers have surgical scars.

08:51.374 --> 08:52.708
Is that on purpose?

08:54.010 --> 08:56.378
And so, how long have you been married?

08:56.379 --> 08:58.380
Three incredible years.

08:58.381 --> 08:59.781
Best years of my life.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.683
And you've had regular
intercourse during that time?

09:01.684 --> 09:03.552
Above average, I'd say.

09:03.553 --> 09:05.754
When did you begin trying to conceive?

09:05.755 --> 09:07.622
Let's see. It's been...

09:07.623 --> 09:09.558
Five years since I've even seen you,

09:09.559 --> 09:12.027
and it's not like we were
bosom buddies to begin with.

09:12.028 --> 09:13.528
You're everything a person could want.

09:13.529 --> 09:14.763
In a sperm donor.

09:14.764 --> 09:17.432
You're tall, you're
handsome, you're brilliant.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.601
I just don't know.

09:19.602 --> 09:23.205
Making a baby with a Turkey baster...
Doesn't that seem...

09:23.206 --> 09:25.441
Like our only option?

09:28.177 --> 09:29.544
I would consider it.

09:29.545 --> 09:32.681
- Austin.
- Okay, maybe.

09:32.682 --> 09:35.183
But I need something in return.

09:35.184 --> 09:37.619
Betty will set up an
appointment for tomorrow,

09:37.620 --> 09:39.321
and we'll be doing a full physical.

09:39.322 --> 09:40.622
Does this one do everything?

09:40.623 --> 09:42.457
Answers the phones, makes the appointments.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.793
Next you'll tell me she does the books.

09:46.429 --> 09:49.064
I just... I love to commend
good work when I see it.

09:49.065 --> 09:50.565
She's got a heart of gold.

09:50.566 --> 09:54.603
Platinum even, which is better than gold.

09:54.604 --> 09:56.538
At St. Luke's, they just got in

09:56.539 --> 09:58.507
a few of those B-mode devices.

09:58.508 --> 10:00.275
Picture quality is out of this world.

10:00.276 --> 10:01.576
So I've heard.

10:01.577 --> 10:03.545
Once you add color, you ought
to start charging admission,

10:03.546 --> 10:04.713
selling popcorn.

10:08.117 --> 10:11.653
Well, our first appointment
is in half an hour.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.389
Mrs. Wilson is 34 weeks pregnant.

10:14.390 --> 10:16.525
We found out at her last appointment

10:16.526 --> 10:19.161
that the fetus is in breech presentation.

10:20.563 --> 10:22.749
I hope you weren't expecting
a dull first day.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.751
No. I worked in the emergency room

10:24.752 --> 10:27.797
for six years before this,
so a breech presentation

10:27.798 --> 10:29.556
is about as dull as it comes for me.

10:29.557 --> 10:31.725
What made you leave all that excitement

10:31.726 --> 10:33.493
for our humble little practice?

10:33.494 --> 10:36.630
Well, you know, punching
in at 9:00 at night

10:36.631 --> 10:39.660
and punching out at 7:00 every morning,

10:39.661 --> 10:41.735
eventually you start to
miss the little things.

10:41.736 --> 10:44.238
You know... like a quiet
dinner with friends.

10:45.406 --> 10:47.107
Or a night out at the symphony.

10:48.776 --> 10:50.477
You strike me as someone

10:50.478 --> 10:52.814
who might like classical music.

10:54.649 --> 10:57.818
In my experience, one classical music lover

10:57.819 --> 11:00.287
can often tell another.

11:26.414 --> 11:28.715
So, Libby.

11:28.716 --> 11:30.417
Short for Elizabeth, right?

11:32.453 --> 11:34.722
Has everyone always called you Libby?

11:39.093 --> 11:42.195
Not always.

11:42.196 --> 11:46.199
Was it Liz or Beth or...

11:46.200 --> 11:48.236
Betty sometimes.

11:51.372 --> 11:53.440
You have a cigarette?

11:53.441 --> 11:55.742
You don't smoke.

11:55.743 --> 11:57.110
No, but in the movies,

11:57.111 --> 11:59.579
after they've been in bed
together, they always...

11:59.580 --> 12:00.580
Why is that?

12:00.581 --> 12:03.216
Is a cigarette better after sex or...

12:03.217 --> 12:06.086
I really don't know.

12:06.087 --> 12:08.288
You could test it out.

12:08.289 --> 12:10.190
It's almost 6:00.

12:10.191 --> 12:12.327
I have to get home and relieve the sitter.

12:15.196 --> 12:17.631
So, we just gonna keep doing this?

12:17.632 --> 12:19.333
Showing up here and jumping into bed,

12:19.334 --> 12:21.535
jumping out of bed, hurrying out the door?

12:21.536 --> 12:23.571
Barely exchanging 10 words to each other?

12:32.480 --> 12:33.680
Here.

12:33.681 --> 12:36.383
My last cigarette.

12:36.384 --> 12:37.518
See for yourself.

12:39.821 --> 12:43.758
There. That was 10 words, wasn't it?

12:51.132 --> 12:53.734
Hopkins, Hopkins, Hopkins!

12:53.735 --> 12:54.801
Thank you.

12:54.802 --> 12:56.837
Emily, the presentation will begin shortly.

12:56.838 --> 12:57.772
Okay.

13:00.441 --> 13:02.142
Melanie Ungar.

13:02.143 --> 13:04.745
Okay. Sit down.

13:04.746 --> 13:06.347
Lester Linden.

13:09.817 --> 13:11.818
The only people allowed in the presentation

13:11.819 --> 13:15.088
are those here to interview
for the program.

13:15.089 --> 13:17.090
Then I'm in the right place.

13:17.091 --> 13:20.127
You have got to be kidding me.

13:20.128 --> 13:21.228
If you can be a surrogate,

13:21.229 --> 13:23.063
I don't see any reason why I can't, too.

13:23.064 --> 13:24.698
Single men are not the only ones

13:24.699 --> 13:27.801
who suffer from sexual dysfunction.

13:27.802 --> 13:31.802
Besides, I was Dr. Masters' first patient.

13:32.106 --> 13:35.743
If it weren't for me, this
program wouldn't exist.

13:40.214 --> 13:42.783
In this new program,
participants will be asked

13:42.784 --> 13:45.085
to commit to regular sessions

13:45.086 --> 13:48.755
over an indefinite period of
time with the same partner.

13:48.756 --> 13:50.290
Now, this partner won't be like the men

13:50.291 --> 13:51.558
you met in the earlier study.

13:51.559 --> 13:55.462
These will be men suffering from
a myriad of sexual dysfunctions,

13:55.463 --> 13:59.166
dysfunctions which you will
be trained to address.

13:59.167 --> 14:02.636
Another difference from the earlier study

14:02.637 --> 14:05.172
is in terms of your remuneration.

14:05.173 --> 14:06.573
In that study, each of you

14:06.574 --> 14:09.776
was paid a stipend for your contribution.

14:09.777 --> 14:13.847
Due to certain, legal limitations,

14:13.848 --> 14:17.848
for this work, we are
seeking volunteers only.

14:18.186 --> 14:20.287
And if that's a problem for anyone,

14:20.288 --> 14:21.622
now is the time to say so.

14:41.175 --> 14:44.344
You're getting closer.

14:44.345 --> 14:47.481
When it's close like that, that
means you're due for a jackpot.

14:47.482 --> 14:49.783
The machine just needs time to warm up.

14:49.784 --> 14:53.353
Thanks for the advice.

14:53.354 --> 14:56.656
Let me guess.

14:56.657 --> 14:58.325
Your husband's here for work.

14:58.326 --> 14:59.659
You got me.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.329
I don't let mine take any
business trips without me.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.097
It's just too much fun.

15:04.098 --> 15:06.733
He does his... whatever
it is he does all day

15:06.734 --> 15:08.735
while I get to enjoy myself.

15:08.736 --> 15:11.404
Last week, we were in New York City.

15:11.405 --> 15:14.374
I spent 4 1/2 hours at Saks.

15:14.375 --> 15:18.375
I thought I must have died
because this is heaven.

15:19.313 --> 15:22.516
And... and what does your husband do?

15:22.517 --> 15:24.784
He's in business.

15:24.785 --> 15:26.286
What kind of business?

15:26.287 --> 15:29.223
Commercial.

15:31.225 --> 15:35.562
To be perfectly honest, whenever
he starts talking about work,

15:35.563 --> 15:39.366
I just sort of nod my head so he
doesn't think I'm not listening,

15:39.367 --> 15:40.634
even though...

15:40.635 --> 15:43.103
I'm not listening.

15:46.107 --> 15:48.441
We do our part, don't we?

15:48.442 --> 15:50.710
We go to the client dinners,

15:50.711 --> 15:54.247
we try to keep the conversation flowing,

15:54.248 --> 15:57.183
and in exchange, we get to live a life

15:57.184 --> 16:00.120
most women can only dream of.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.191
Excuse me.

16:10.765 --> 16:14.068
Yes. Yes, yes, yes!

16:20.708 --> 16:22.842
My god. My god.

16:27.415 --> 16:28.548
Miss?

16:28.549 --> 16:30.216
Hopkins. Single.

16:30.217 --> 16:31.117
Divorced.

16:31.118 --> 16:32.385
Married.

16:32.386 --> 16:33.587
Happily.

16:33.588 --> 16:37.588
My first sexual experience?

16:38.426 --> 16:41.194
15. Sleep-away camp.

16:41.195 --> 16:43.063
11.

16:43.064 --> 16:44.331
Wait.

16:44.332 --> 16:45.733
Do you mean with another person?

16:47.435 --> 16:50.103
Why are you interested in surrogacy work?

16:50.104 --> 16:51.404
Because I want to help people.

16:54.342 --> 16:57.611
I'm not looking for a husband,
if that's what you mean.

16:57.612 --> 16:59.312
Is that what you mean?

16:59.313 --> 17:01.147
I-I'm not trying to get back at Jane.

17:01.148 --> 17:02.582
Why would I do that?

17:02.583 --> 17:04.351
Do you find that you have difficulty

17:04.352 --> 17:06.453
separating emotion from sex?

17:06.454 --> 17:09.155
As long as I'm in love
with the other person,

17:09.156 --> 17:11.057
it's not a problem.

17:11.058 --> 17:12.292
Is that what you mean?

17:14.762 --> 17:16.429
Would you have sex with a man

17:16.430 --> 17:19.232
to whom you are not physically attracted?

17:19.233 --> 17:20.468
Does it pay extra?

17:22.502 --> 17:25.739
Are you able to separate love from sex?

17:25.740 --> 17:27.407
Only every night.

17:30.378 --> 17:31.745
Thank you, Lester.

17:31.746 --> 17:32.846
That will be all.

17:32.847 --> 17:34.347
Did I get it?

17:34.348 --> 17:36.750
I'll let you know when I have a decision.

17:36.751 --> 17:39.387
Can I at least tell Jane that I got it?

17:41.122 --> 17:43.223
Shallow respiration, skin flushed,

17:43.224 --> 17:44.691
perspiration, vocalization.

17:44.692 --> 17:46.426
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

17:46.427 --> 17:48.061
So, you were saying?

17:48.062 --> 17:50.196
I saw four people win jackpots today,

17:50.197 --> 17:53.166
and every time the reaction
was exactly the same.

17:53.167 --> 17:55.168
Are you telling me those
people were having an orgasm?

17:55.169 --> 17:56.603
No. Not exactly.

17:56.604 --> 17:58.571
There were obviously major differences,

17:58.572 --> 18:01.775
but it's impossible to
ignore the fact that the...

18:01.776 --> 18:03.076
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

18:03.077 --> 18:04.377
Sir.

18:04.378 --> 18:06.379
Physiological response to winning money

18:06.380 --> 18:09.516
is virtually identical to
the body's response to sex.

18:09.517 --> 18:12.719
This could open up an entirely
new area of research.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.087
So, in other words,

18:14.088 --> 18:16.222
you spent your day off doing field work?

18:16.223 --> 18:19.526
In between my appointments.

18:19.527 --> 18:21.127
I couldn't help it.

18:21.128 --> 18:23.831
Everywhere you look in
this city, you find sex.

18:27.201 --> 18:30.103
I saw a bride at the slot machines,

18:30.104 --> 18:32.772
dress still on from the night before.

18:32.773 --> 18:35.175
Now, what satisfaction

18:35.176 --> 18:38.344
could she possibly be getting
from pulling a lever

18:38.345 --> 18:40.213
that she'd rather be sitting in a casino

18:40.214 --> 18:43.183
than upstairs in her hotel room
consummating her marriage?

18:44.552 --> 18:45.819
Well, your Vegas experience

18:45.820 --> 18:48.121
was clearly more productive than mine.

18:48.122 --> 18:50.657
No one was interested in the idea?

18:50.658 --> 18:52.258
Not a one.

18:52.259 --> 18:54.127
I suppose tonight's my last chance.

18:54.128 --> 18:56.096
Well, how can I help?

18:56.097 --> 18:57.263
You've worked enough today.

18:57.264 --> 18:58.798
All you have to do is sit back, relax,

18:58.799 --> 19:01.268
and be your charming self.

19:06.373 --> 19:10.143
♪ ♪

19:10.144 --> 19:13.079
Now, why would the average customer

19:13.080 --> 19:15.315
choose one casino over another?

19:15.316 --> 19:16.816
They have the same table games,

19:16.817 --> 19:19.619
the same slot machines, the same decor.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.489
Hell, even the cocktail
waitresses look the same.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.824
Mr. Logan...

19:24.825 --> 19:28.825
I consider myself as open to
risk as any businessman can be.

19:30.264 --> 19:31.531
But...

19:31.532 --> 19:34.701
I got to have the numbers.

19:34.702 --> 19:36.236
I got to see them.

19:36.237 --> 19:38.238
I got to be able to hold them in my hand.

19:38.239 --> 19:42.709
And the idea of pumping smells in the air

19:42.710 --> 19:44.444
to generate revenue...

19:44.445 --> 19:47.080
Um, it's a bit theoretical.

19:47.081 --> 19:48.516
I couldn't disagree more.

19:50.618 --> 19:54.320
I spent the afternoon in your casino.

19:54.321 --> 19:57.590
The truth is, I almost left
the second I walked in.

19:57.591 --> 19:59.692
The smell.

19:59.693 --> 20:03.229
Not just the flat beer and cigarette smoke,

20:03.230 --> 20:05.465
but the smell underneath all of that.

20:05.466 --> 20:07.767
You see, the human nose is capable

20:07.768 --> 20:09.536
of differentiating between thousands

20:09.537 --> 20:11.404
of individual scents...

20:11.405 --> 20:13.239
Failure, desperation, shame.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.475
Maybe that's why you hand
out all those free drinks.

20:15.476 --> 20:18.344
Exactly. Alcohol dulls the
senses quite effectively.

20:18.345 --> 20:20.113
Yes, going into a casino is...

20:20.114 --> 20:23.384
Is much like going to bed with someone.

20:25.186 --> 20:27.187
They're both a means of escape.

20:27.188 --> 20:30.056
A way to leave behind the
mundane chores of the day.

20:30.057 --> 20:32.225
You walk up to a roulette table,

20:32.226 --> 20:35.562
and you place your bet... excitement.

20:35.563 --> 20:38.798
Spin the wheel... plateau.

20:38.799 --> 20:42.135
It lands on your number... climax.

20:42.136 --> 20:46.172
The adrenaline subsides... resolution.

20:46.173 --> 20:49.375
Although let's be honest, Mr. Avery...

20:49.376 --> 20:52.745
How often does the wheel
land on your number?

20:52.746 --> 20:56.616
Now, most people in this casino will lose,

20:56.617 --> 20:59.419
and that has its own smell,
a smell that the customer

20:59.420 --> 21:02.388
can sense the second he steps foot inside.

21:02.389 --> 21:08.455
And much like sex, once the
mood is killed, it's all over.

21:10.631 --> 21:13.299
Your... your secretary

21:13.300 --> 21:14.801
makes some interesting points, Mr. Logan.

21:14.802 --> 21:16.236
No, I'm not his secretary.

21:16.237 --> 21:19.105
- I'm his associate.
- Partner.

21:19.106 --> 21:21.608
And a trained psychologist.

21:21.609 --> 21:24.510
Mrs. Johnson understands better
than anyone the intimate links

21:24.511 --> 21:28.248
between the senses and the human psyche.

21:28.249 --> 21:31.117
Well, I...

21:31.118 --> 21:33.086
I can't give you an answer right away.

21:33.087 --> 21:35.121
I need to talk to my associates.

21:35.122 --> 21:38.157
In the meantime, to, convince you

21:38.158 --> 21:41.794
to get past your objections
to the smell of my casino...

21:41.795 --> 21:42.795
Yeah.

21:42.796 --> 21:45.565
Please enjoy yourselves.

21:45.566 --> 21:47.401
It's on the house.

21:58.178 --> 22:00.179
We have one more candidate.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.582
This is Nora Everett.

22:10.557 --> 22:12.725
I'm sorry.

22:12.726 --> 22:15.428
I can't seem to find
your file, Miss Everett.

22:15.429 --> 22:16.629
Do you... do you remember

22:16.630 --> 22:19.098
what year you participated in the study?

22:19.099 --> 22:20.166
I didn't.

22:20.167 --> 22:23.169
I was too young.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.672
You don't remember me, do you?

22:25.673 --> 22:27.640
Nora? From the neighborhood?

22:27.641 --> 22:29.742
My parents were Kirk and Sally Everett.

22:29.743 --> 22:31.444
224 Pine Grove.

22:34.715 --> 22:37.617
I'm sorry. I-I didn't recognize you.

22:37.618 --> 22:39.218
Well, the last time you saw me,

22:39.219 --> 22:41.621
I had braces and those coke-bottle glasses.

22:41.622 --> 22:44.123
Right.

22:44.124 --> 22:48.361
And, you're here for the...
For the surrogacy program?

22:48.362 --> 22:50.163
I've been calling the office for months,

22:50.164 --> 22:51.397
asking if there were

22:51.398 --> 22:53.232
any volunteer opportunities available.

22:53.233 --> 22:56.803
I wonder if this particular program

22:56.804 --> 22:58.271
is the right fit for you.

22:58.272 --> 22:59.706
I'm not squeamish about sex,

22:59.707 --> 23:01.374
if that's what you're thinking.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.343
Well, one's upbringing
does determine a good deal

23:03.344 --> 23:06.179
of, one's relationship to sex.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.247
And you think because my parents

23:08.248 --> 23:09.515
were stuffy Episcopalians,

23:09.516 --> 23:11.851
I must have turned out that way, too?

23:11.852 --> 23:14.821
I probably would have...

23:14.822 --> 23:16.589
Until they made the mistake of sending me

23:16.590 --> 23:20.093
to my grandparents' farm in
Clarksville when I was 12.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.728
My job was to help the horse breeder.

23:21.729 --> 23:23.196
Really?

23:23.197 --> 23:24.330
Some of the stallions,

23:24.331 --> 23:26.632
they would get nervous around the mares.

23:26.633 --> 23:30.269
Any kind of distraction, and it
was over before it even started.

23:30.270 --> 23:32.772
My job was to keep them calm...

23:32.773 --> 23:36.709
Pet them, let them lick my
hand, make them comfortable.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.077
Once they could relax,

23:38.078 --> 23:39.847
everything else would take care of itself.

23:41.715 --> 23:43.383
It's hard to understand

23:43.384 --> 23:45.084
why people make such a fuss about sex

23:45.085 --> 23:47.453
after spending a summer doing that.

23:47.454 --> 23:51.624
I just came to think of sex
as another part of life.

23:51.625 --> 23:55.625
I read your book, months ago.

23:56.563 --> 24:01.169
I had never realized sex could be so...
Complicated.

24:01.535 --> 24:03.503
Well, the book was written

24:03.504 --> 24:06.506
with a... a medical readership in mind.

24:06.507 --> 24:10.076
I didn't mean complicated in a bad sense.

24:10.077 --> 24:12.278
More like...

24:12.279 --> 24:14.680
Like a watch.

24:14.681 --> 24:16.549
On the outside, it looks simple,

24:16.550 --> 24:20.553
but once you see all the
gears and the springs,

24:20.554 --> 24:23.489
how each tiny part clicks
into place just so,

24:23.490 --> 24:25.291
well, it's remarkable, isn't it?

24:35.803 --> 24:38.304
Well...

24:38.305 --> 24:41.141
Thank you for coming in.

24:48.749 --> 24:51.485
Training will begin at 9:00.

25:00.327 --> 25:07.467
♪ The look of love is in your eyes ♪

25:07.468 --> 25:09.535
No, but then what happens is,

25:09.536 --> 25:11.304
they're both actually very happy

25:11.305 --> 25:12.738
and they both make out very well,

25:12.739 --> 25:15.842
because... because the man...

25:15.843 --> 25:17.310
♪ The look your heart can't disguise ♪

25:17.311 --> 25:18.578
I swear...

25:18.579 --> 25:21.114
I put my keys in my pocket before we left.

25:21.115 --> 25:25.115
♪ The look of love ♪

25:27.221 --> 25:29.789
♪ is saying so much more ♪

25:29.790 --> 25:31.224
- What in the world?
- What?

25:31.225 --> 25:33.192
My...

25:33.193 --> 25:34.293
don't move! don't move!

25:34.294 --> 25:36.062
- Give me your wallet.
- All right.

25:36.063 --> 25:38.164
- It's... it's not a problem.
- Jewelry, jewelry.

25:38.165 --> 25:39.298
What's your name?

25:39.299 --> 25:41.200
- Take it off.
- I'm Dan.

25:41.201 --> 25:42.201
I didn't get your name.

25:42.202 --> 25:43.736
Back... back up. Back up.

25:43.737 --> 25:45.238
T-tell her to hurry up.

25:45.239 --> 25:46.606
Give me the necklace.

25:46.607 --> 25:47.673
Give him the necklace!

25:47.674 --> 25:49.475
I'm going as quickly as I can.

25:49.476 --> 25:51.411
- Hurry up!
- I'm going...

26:00.854 --> 26:02.322
Call the police.

26:10.531 --> 26:12.198
Martin O'Reilly.

26:12.199 --> 26:14.367
Private first class, U.S. army.

26:17.337 --> 26:18.771
What are you doing?

26:18.772 --> 26:20.506
He's in the army?

26:20.507 --> 26:23.176
Not anymore. He was discharged.

26:23.177 --> 26:25.244
How old is he?

26:25.245 --> 26:29.382
"Date of birth... December 5, 1947."

26:29.383 --> 26:31.751
So he's 19.

26:31.752 --> 26:35.254
You need to call the police,
Virginia, before he comes to.

26:35.255 --> 26:38.057
Virginia, call the police.

26:38.058 --> 26:39.458
No.

26:39.459 --> 26:40.694
Then give me the phone.

26:42.796 --> 26:45.765
Johnny dissected a frog in school today.

26:45.766 --> 26:48.301
He insisted on telling
us about it at dinner.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.771
Now Jenny says she'll never
eat anything green again.

26:53.273 --> 26:56.242
Do you remember Nora Everett?

26:56.243 --> 26:58.244
Of course.

26:58.245 --> 27:00.246
Kirk and Sally's daughter.

27:00.247 --> 27:02.481
She used to zoom by on her bike

27:02.482 --> 27:05.551
up and down the block every afternoon.

27:05.552 --> 27:07.453
What made you think of her?

27:07.454 --> 27:10.122
She came into the office today.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.059
Fertility treatments?

27:13.060 --> 27:15.161
No.

27:15.162 --> 27:19.365
Actually, she volunteered
for the surrogacy program.

27:19.366 --> 27:20.733
You're joking?

27:20.734 --> 27:24.734
Please tell me that you turned her away.

27:25.305 --> 27:26.839
Why would I do that?

27:26.840 --> 27:29.408
Nora Everett was...

27:29.409 --> 27:32.645
Was a lovely young girl. I...

27:32.646 --> 27:34.547
You can't allow her to do work like that,

27:34.548 --> 27:37.116
h-have sex with strange men.

27:37.117 --> 27:40.686
She's not volunteering to
have sex with strange men.

27:40.687 --> 27:43.256
She's volunteering to relieve the suffering

27:43.257 --> 27:45.157
of men in terrible pain.

27:45.158 --> 27:47.560
- Through sex.
- Through touch.

27:47.561 --> 27:51.364
Human beings cannot survive
without being touched.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.968
It's a basic biological need

27:52.969 --> 27:55.601
hardwired into us over
millennia of evolution.

27:55.602 --> 28:00.637
Now, not everyone can find an
adequate partner on his own.

28:05.950 --> 28:10.687
What we're... providing is
a temporary substitute.

28:12.818 --> 28:14.775
Is that really enough?

28:16.089 --> 28:17.224
A stand-in?

28:19.559 --> 28:21.724
For some people, it's all they have.

28:46.527 --> 28:48.455
You need to eat something.

29:03.230 --> 29:04.838
You were in the army?

29:07.774 --> 29:09.073
Where?

29:11.345 --> 29:12.611
Y-you wouldn't know it.

29:12.612 --> 29:14.080
In Vietnam?

29:14.081 --> 29:15.252
What... what do you care?

29:15.253 --> 29:17.967
Hey! If it wasn't for her, you'd
be sitting in jail right now.

29:17.968 --> 29:19.067
Don't yell at him.

29:19.068 --> 29:20.753
He had a knife pointed
at us five minutes ago.

29:20.754 --> 29:24.423
I understand that, Dan.

29:24.424 --> 29:27.393
My son is there...

29:27.394 --> 29:30.262
In Vietnam.

29:30.263 --> 29:31.664
I'm sorry.

29:31.665 --> 29:35.368
There's no need to be sorry.

29:35.369 --> 29:37.103
He's coming back.

29:37.104 --> 29:38.704
I guarantee you he won't be the same

29:38.705 --> 29:40.106
as he was when he left.

29:40.107 --> 29:41.707
I did two tours in the pacific.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.309
I turned out okay.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.378
This war...

29:45.379 --> 29:47.413
It's not like the war that you fought in.

29:47.414 --> 29:51.996
Before I left, I had never
even dranken a beer before,

29:52.619 --> 29:54.153
never smoked a cigarette.

29:54.154 --> 29:57.723
But over there, for $2,
you buy a bag of horse,

29:57.724 --> 30:00.459
you can disappear for a few minutes.

30:00.460 --> 30:03.763
And that sounded like a
fucking bargain to me.

30:03.764 --> 30:07.666
I, came home six months ago.

30:07.667 --> 30:11.171
My parents kicked me out
a couple weeks back.

30:15.542 --> 30:18.677
So I stole my mother's jewelry.

30:20.313 --> 30:24.450
I pawned her grandmother's engagement ring

30:24.451 --> 30:27.821
for, 20 bucks.

30:30.557 --> 30:33.793
I, took the bus down here

30:33.794 --> 30:38.431
and got a job at the hotel,
working in the kitchen.

30:38.432 --> 30:41.801
You've been robbing
people's rooms on the side?

30:41.802 --> 30:43.836
This was my first try.

30:43.837 --> 30:45.738
I don't think you have
much of a future in it.

30:45.739 --> 30:48.340
Does your mother know where you are?

30:48.341 --> 30:50.476
She doesn't give a shit, either.

30:50.477 --> 30:52.411
No, I...

30:52.412 --> 30:55.448
I don't think that's true.

30:55.449 --> 30:58.184
You don't know my mother.

30:58.185 --> 31:00.186
After what I did...

31:00.187 --> 31:07.259
I know that any mother would
want to hear from her son,

31:07.260 --> 31:08.494
no matter what he's done.

31:09.629 --> 31:13.629
Telling her that he's okay.

31:16.069 --> 31:20.072
So, what happens now?

31:20.073 --> 31:22.508
We could drop you off
at the Police Station.

31:22.509 --> 31:26.779
Isn't there a place that...

31:26.780 --> 31:30.783
He could go, a program that could help you?

31:30.784 --> 31:34.053
I-I can't... I can't afford
something like that.

31:34.054 --> 31:36.323
I can.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.762
Before we do anything...

31:43.763 --> 31:46.266
You're gonna call your mother.

31:49.336 --> 31:52.839
Now, there are several major
male sexual dysfunctions.

31:54.207 --> 31:56.575
I thought you were asking us to name them.

31:56.576 --> 31:58.244
Well...

31:58.245 --> 32:00.412
We haven't quite gotten
through all the material yet.

32:00.413 --> 32:01.347
I guess I read ahead.

32:01.348 --> 32:03.115
Never mind.

32:03.116 --> 32:06.186
No. Please.

32:07.721 --> 32:11.457
There's impotence, primary and secondary;

32:11.458 --> 32:14.627
premature ejaculation;
Ejaculatory incompetence;

32:14.628 --> 32:17.663
and male dyspareunia.

32:17.664 --> 32:20.065
What are some of the principal causes

32:20.066 --> 32:22.234
of secondary impotence?

32:22.235 --> 32:24.737
The concept of spectatoring

32:24.738 --> 32:27.506
- might be helpful here.
- Spectatoring?

32:27.507 --> 32:30.109
I don't believe that was in
the material I gave you.

32:30.110 --> 32:31.477
I read about it...

32:31.478 --> 32:34.547
In an interview you and Mrs.
Johnson gave, actually.

32:35.815 --> 32:38.617
It describes when a man or a woman

32:38.618 --> 32:42.154
observes him or herself during
sex as if from a distance.

32:42.155 --> 32:45.124
In the case of men, spectatoring
can lead to self-consciousness,

32:45.125 --> 32:48.527
which can, in turn, lead
to a loss of erection.

32:48.528 --> 32:50.296
That is all very true...

32:50.297 --> 32:52.131
In my experience...

32:52.132 --> 32:53.365
As a surrogate.

32:53.366 --> 32:56.402
Very first surrogate, that is.

32:56.403 --> 32:58.604
When are we gonna talk about
female sexual response?

33:00.540 --> 33:02.241
I suppose the two of us

33:02.242 --> 33:04.476
will have to have a separate
course on the subject.

33:04.477 --> 33:05.811
Remedial course.

33:05.812 --> 33:08.414
You were singing a
different tune last night.

33:08.415 --> 33:11.150
Why don't we take 15 minutes?

33:25.365 --> 33:29.368
You seem to have a... a
gift for this material.

33:29.369 --> 33:33.369
I just find it interesting, is all.

33:34.574 --> 33:38.177
Did you take many science
courses in college?

33:39.579 --> 33:42.581
The last science class I took
was high-school biology.

33:42.582 --> 33:45.351
I was lucky to escape with a "C" minus.

33:46.453 --> 33:49.188
I started college but never finished.

33:49.189 --> 33:51.724
I'd like to someday.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.560
Well, so far,

33:54.561 --> 33:57.596
you're on track for an
"A" plus in this course.

34:01.167 --> 34:02.401
It's funny.

34:02.402 --> 34:04.637
When I was a kid, I was terrified of you.

34:04.638 --> 34:08.107
This one time, I was 10.

34:08.108 --> 34:11.777
I fell off my bike right
in front of your house.

34:11.777 --> 34:13.478
My legs were all scraped up.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.214
Mrs. Masters saw what had happened.

34:15.215 --> 34:17.750
She brought me inside,
cleaned up the blood,

34:17.751 --> 34:19.217
gave me a glass of lemonade.

34:19.219 --> 34:21.120
You had just walked in from work,

34:21.121 --> 34:23.288
and she told you you would
have to take me home.

34:23.289 --> 34:25.391
You didn't say a word to me the whole way,

34:25.391 --> 34:26.824
not even goodbye when I got out.

34:26.826 --> 34:30.195
It was like I didn't even exist.

34:30.196 --> 34:34.099
I don't know what it is, Dr.
Masters, but you've changed.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.235
You're nothing like I remember you.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.654
Here you go.

34:55.655 --> 34:57.623
It loses some of its sparkle

34:57.624 --> 34:59.324
in the cold light of day.

34:59.325 --> 35:00.459
don't you think?

35:00.460 --> 35:02.494
What light?

35:02.495 --> 35:05.297
No windows in a casino, so
the morning never comes.

35:05.298 --> 35:09.269
It just goes on and on forever.

35:15.575 --> 35:17.242
Any news?

35:17.243 --> 35:19.478
Avery has decided not to move forward

35:19.479 --> 35:21.313
with my proposal for his casino.

35:21.314 --> 35:24.383
I hope that I didn't... I didn't ruin it.

35:24.384 --> 35:26.319
It wasn't that.

35:29.155 --> 35:31.523
Still...

35:31.524 --> 35:33.625
I'm sorry.

35:33.626 --> 35:36.061
Not just for the account, but...

35:37.731 --> 35:39.799
You brought me here to relax.

35:42.168 --> 35:44.803
I canceled all of those appointments

35:44.804 --> 35:46.772
you made me yesterday.

35:46.773 --> 35:49.209
I assumed you would.

36:00.086 --> 36:01.286
Do you think he'll be okay?

36:01.287 --> 36:05.191
I think we gave him as
good a shot as we could.

36:08.128 --> 36:09.695
You never had children.

36:09.696 --> 36:12.264
Mnh-mnh.

36:12.265 --> 36:15.300
You would have been a great father.

36:15.301 --> 36:18.137
I can tell.

36:18.138 --> 36:22.574
Well, it wasn't my decision to make.

36:22.575 --> 36:26.746
We should really get some sleep
before we make this flight.

36:34.254 --> 36:36.822
You've got great hands.

36:36.823 --> 36:39.424
Long palms.

36:39.425 --> 36:43.462
A long palm is a strong indicator
of the element of air.

36:43.463 --> 36:45.597
Short palms... I have short palms...

36:45.598 --> 36:48.634
That's more the element of fire.

36:48.635 --> 36:51.203
This is the children's line.

36:51.204 --> 36:53.071
Most people have a few.

36:53.072 --> 36:54.339
I only have one.

36:54.340 --> 36:56.742
That's how I know this baby's meant to be.

36:56.743 --> 36:59.611
So you read palms?

36:59.612 --> 37:01.146
No, I

37:01.147 --> 37:03.081
I read it in a book.

37:03.082 --> 37:06.685
In my knitting circle, all
the wives get together,

37:06.686 --> 37:09.321
and we gab and read books...

37:09.322 --> 37:12.758
And knit, obviously, 'cause
it's a knitting circle.

37:16.162 --> 37:18.530
I'm afraid, from what I've seen today,

37:18.531 --> 37:22.601
that conception without
intervention in your case

37:22.602 --> 37:24.069
would be impossible.

37:26.472 --> 37:29.341
- If it's the only way...
- It's god's will.

37:29.342 --> 37:32.511
Well, I think it must be, Mrs. Langham.

37:32.512 --> 37:35.180
Given that the two of you
have never actually had sex,

37:35.181 --> 37:38.317
I do believe it would have
taken a literal act of god

37:38.318 --> 37:40.552
for you to produce a child.

37:40.553 --> 37:42.254
I'm sorry. I-I...

37:42.255 --> 37:44.356
Mrs. Langham's hymen is intact.

37:44.357 --> 37:47.359
Now, this indicates to me

37:47.360 --> 37:51.096
that the three years you've
spent trying to conceive

37:51.097 --> 37:53.166
must have consisted of heavy petting.

37:55.235 --> 37:57.302
Look, Bill...

37:57.303 --> 37:58.770
We're not really married.

37:58.771 --> 38:00.305
Really?

38:00.306 --> 38:01.473
It's just...

38:01.474 --> 38:03.075
All I want is a baby.

38:03.076 --> 38:04.843
She doesn't have anyone to have it with.

38:04.844 --> 38:06.545
And the... the adoption agencies,

38:06.546 --> 38:08.547
they won't even consider a single woman.

38:08.548 --> 38:10.682
She knew that you would never say yes

38:10.683 --> 38:11.750
to inseminating a woman

38:11.751 --> 38:13.552
who wanted to raise a child by herself,

38:13.553 --> 38:16.722
so she asked me for my help.

38:16.723 --> 38:18.290
And what are you

38:18.291 --> 38:20.525
getting out of this act
of altruism, Austin?

38:22.517 --> 38:25.163
Elise is trying to take what
little custody I still have

38:25.164 --> 38:27.399
of my kids away from me.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.134
She's using everything against me...

38:29.135 --> 38:31.303
The Della's lawsuits, my s...

38:31.304 --> 38:32.838
M-my current real-estate holdings.

38:32.839 --> 38:34.573
I finally found this lawyer.

38:34.574 --> 38:35.807
He's the first person I've talked to

38:35.808 --> 38:37.242
who thinks I might have a shot,

38:37.243 --> 38:41.079
but he has a... a $1,000
retainer, and I'm dead broke.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.282
They offered to spot me the money.

38:43.283 --> 38:46.485
I know you're angry with me, Bill, but...

38:46.486 --> 38:48.553
Helen would be a great mother.

38:48.554 --> 38:50.389
She deserves to have a kid.

38:50.390 --> 38:53.425
Helen?

38:53.426 --> 38:54.694
Helen?

38:56.229 --> 39:00.098
Um, could you do 9:30?

39:00.099 --> 39:02.367
Conference room... now.

39:02.368 --> 39:04.704
Hold on one moment, please.

39:11.444 --> 39:14.079
Shut the door.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.481
Before you get all "Betty
this, Betty that"...

39:16.482 --> 39:18.350
Tell me this isn't what it looks like.

39:18.351 --> 39:21.219
This isn't what it looks like.

39:21.220 --> 39:22.287
You went behind my back.

39:22.288 --> 39:23.789
You deliberately deceived me.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.525
You mean I did exactly what
you're doing to Virginia?

39:26.526 --> 39:28.413
Starting up a whole surrogacy program

39:28.414 --> 39:29.640
without even telling her!

39:29.641 --> 39:30.729
don't try and change the subject.

39:30.730 --> 39:33.198
You lied to me about a patient's identity.

39:33.199 --> 39:35.100
You falsified records!

39:36.142 --> 39:38.503
What else was I supposed to do?!

39:38.504 --> 39:40.739
If Helen and I came in for
fertility treatments,

39:40.740 --> 39:42.541
what would you have done...
Gone ahead with it?

39:42.542 --> 39:44.743
This is the single worst
breach of professionalism.

39:44.744 --> 39:45.636
Professionalism?

39:45.637 --> 39:48.763
I-I do not think that you are the
best spokesman on the subject.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.750
We keep our personal affairs
out of this office!

39:51.751 --> 39:54.486
We both know that is not true!

39:56.055 --> 39:58.978
You can yell at me, you can scream at me,

39:58.979 --> 40:00.978
you can call me all the names in the book,

40:00.979 --> 40:04.727
but do me a favor... do not
insult my intelligence!

40:06.332 --> 40:09.052
I am a lesbian, not a moron.

40:12.638 --> 40:18.020
You have every right in the
world to can me for what I did.

40:18.811 --> 40:20.723
But all I'll say is this, Doc.

40:22.682 --> 40:26.682
I have been working here seven years.

40:27.620 --> 40:32.620
And I have become an expert
at looking the other way.

40:35.395 --> 40:38.264
Maybe it's your turn to do the same for me.

40:49.275 --> 40:52.511
Sorry about that. Yeah.

40:52.512 --> 40:55.380
We can do 9:15.

40:55.381 --> 40:58.250
All right. Thank you so much.

40:58.251 --> 40:59.485
Bye-bye.

41:03.322 --> 41:05.657
So, what do you tell him?

41:05.658 --> 41:09.594
Bill... when he asks what
you've been doing all day?

41:09.595 --> 41:11.397
He doesn't.

41:13.332 --> 41:15.200
Boy, that can't be easy.

41:16.506 --> 41:20.479
Going home, putting the kids to
bed, sitting down to dinner,

41:21.407 --> 41:23.409
pretending like none of this is happening.

41:25.478 --> 41:28.213
I mean, that is why you
close the curtains, right,

41:28.214 --> 41:31.183
and shut off the lights?

41:31.184 --> 41:35.184
And why the second it's over
you just rush out the door?

41:36.089 --> 41:39.157
And why you and I haven't once talked

41:39.158 --> 41:40.593
about what's going on here?

41:43.129 --> 41:45.697
It's because you feel guilty...

41:45.698 --> 41:46.698
About Bill.

41:46.699 --> 41:48.200
Bill.

41:48.201 --> 41:51.470
Really?

41:51.471 --> 41:54.272
Well, that's why you keep your eyes
shut when we make love, isn't it?

41:54.273 --> 41:56.541
You have no idea what you're talking about.

41:56.542 --> 41:58.310
So you can imagine somehow

41:58.311 --> 42:00.212
that what's happening here isn't real?

42:00.213 --> 42:01.958
Or... or maybe you keep your eyes shut

42:01.959 --> 42:04.449
so you can imagine you're
with Bill instead of with me.

42:04.450 --> 42:06.905
It has nothing to do with Bill!

42:06.906 --> 42:09.288
Well, then what does it have to do, Libby?!

42:24.237 --> 42:25.771
His name...

42:28.341 --> 42:30.209
Was Robert.

42:33.779 --> 42:37.215
He spent the summer of 1964

42:37.216 --> 42:40.452
registering voters in Mississippi.

42:40.453 --> 42:43.355
The freedom summer.

42:43.356 --> 42:45.757
He was arrested three times,

42:45.758 --> 42:48.193
and he had his nose
broken by a police baton,

42:48.194 --> 42:53.009
and then he came home to St. Louis alive.

42:54.433 --> 42:58.470
And two weeks later, he was
crossing Delmar Boulevard

42:58.471 --> 43:03.876
when this... car ca... came out of nowhere.

43:06.112 --> 43:08.714
The driver had fallen asleep at the wheel.

43:13.653 --> 43:18.248
So often I thought about
how we would say goodbye.

43:20.059 --> 43:22.557
I mean, it had to happen eventually.

43:24.263 --> 43:25.363
But neither of us

43:25.364 --> 43:28.633
would have just left
without saying anything.

43:28.634 --> 43:32.634
That was unthinkable.

43:33.472 --> 43:36.575
Which is why I...

43:36.576 --> 43:41.079
I still can't believe that he's gone...

43:41.080 --> 43:42.682
Because...

43:52.191 --> 43:55.660
Robert and I were...

43:55.661 --> 43:57.596
We were, um...

43:57.597 --> 43:59.264
We were good friends.

44:02.668 --> 44:04.169
I...

44:04.170 --> 44:07.305
I can't give you any more of myself

44:07.306 --> 44:09.574
because I have already given it all.

44:24.156 --> 44:26.291
Mr. Avery.

44:26.292 --> 44:29.728
I just came to help Mr.
Logan finish packing.

44:29.729 --> 44:32.530
He stepped in the shower.

44:32.531 --> 44:35.600
Well, I hope that you're here

44:35.601 --> 44:37.802
because you've changed your mind.

44:37.803 --> 44:41.172
Actually, I'm here to try
to convince Mr. Logan

44:41.173 --> 44:42.207
to change his mind.

44:42.208 --> 44:43.708
See, it... it...

44:43.709 --> 44:45.730
Just doesn't make sense, you know?

44:45.731 --> 44:47.779
We're offering him every
penny that he's asking for,

44:47.780 --> 44:50.448
and then all of a sudden, he
decides to read the fine print,

44:50.449 --> 44:51.683
and he's no longer interested?

44:51.684 --> 44:54.386
- The fine print?
- Yeah.

44:54.387 --> 44:55.420
I mean, he should have told us

44:55.421 --> 44:57.804
he's unwilling to relocate to Las Vegas.

44:57.805 --> 45:00.592
What's so important about his ties to St.
Louis anyway

45:00.593 --> 45:04.462
that's enough to make him
turn down a $60,000 contract?

45:04.463 --> 45:06.798
Anyway, I want him to reconsider,

45:06.799 --> 45:08.734
so tell him to call me.

45:19.845 --> 45:22.614
Thought you didn't have a liquor license.

45:22.615 --> 45:25.517
What are you... Eliot Ness?

45:25.518 --> 45:26.685
I was looking forward

45:26.686 --> 45:29.187
to missing the taste of
whiskey for nine months.

45:29.188 --> 45:31.489
Helen.

45:31.490 --> 45:33.325
Well, you're missing out on one kid.

45:33.326 --> 45:34.727
I'm about to lose three.

45:36.796 --> 45:38.229
No contest.

45:38.230 --> 45:39.597
Those kids are the best thing...

45:39.598 --> 45:42.067
Maybe the only good thing I've ever done.

45:42.068 --> 45:45.170
You have to fight to keep that
little bit of good in your life.

45:53.179 --> 45:54.779
You're not losing those kids.

45:54.780 --> 45:56.214
We're gonna give you the money.

45:56.215 --> 45:58.516
I couldn't.

45:58.517 --> 46:00.318
Doesn't feel right, you helping me

46:00.319 --> 46:01.720
without getting something
out of the bargain.

46:01.721 --> 46:05.825
I didn't say that.

46:10.629 --> 46:12.097
I just want to say thanks

46:12.098 --> 46:13.765
for a great first week, Dr. Scully.

46:13.766 --> 46:15.300
Thank you, Jonathan.

46:17.136 --> 46:18.236
I-I'm sorry.

46:18.237 --> 46:20.472
I have to ask.

46:20.473 --> 46:21.774
H-how did I...

46:23.476 --> 46:25.377
How did you... how did you know?

46:25.378 --> 46:27.679
I-I-I try to be so careful.

46:27.680 --> 46:30.448
Y-you... you didn't give yourself away,

46:30.449 --> 46:31.783
if that's what you mean.

46:33.686 --> 46:37.589
As a... a classical music lover.

46:37.590 --> 46:40.125
Right.

46:40.126 --> 46:41.393
Yeah.

46:41.394 --> 46:42.527
You know, it's my job

46:42.528 --> 46:44.729
to see things that other people don't...

46:44.730 --> 46:48.199
The tiniest little blip on the monitor,

46:48.200 --> 46:51.603
the smallest fraction of
a skip in the heartbeat.

46:53.839 --> 46:55.573
I'll see you on Monday.

48:17.790 --> 48:20.391
I was just refreshing my memory

48:20.392 --> 48:22.060
on some of the material for next week.

48:22.061 --> 48:26.061
Well, I'm just locking up for the night.

48:26.165 --> 48:29.634
I'll only be another hour.

48:29.635 --> 48:33.272
I can... I can make sure
everything's locked before I go.

48:37.543 --> 48:40.311
S... are... are you...

48:40.312 --> 48:42.213
Are you sleeping here?

48:42.214 --> 48:44.516
I stayed here last night,

48:44.517 --> 48:47.186
but that was the only time, I swear.

48:48.654 --> 48:52.257
I was late on my last rent check.

48:52.258 --> 48:54.692
I came home, and all of my
things were on the sidewalk.

48:54.693 --> 48:57.662
People were walking by,
picking through them

48:57.663 --> 48:59.230
like it was some kind of yard sale.

48:59.231 --> 49:03.302
Surely they can't evict you
because of one late check.

49:05.371 --> 49:08.407
It wasn't just the one.

49:12.678 --> 49:14.679
I was gonna stay here for a few nights

49:14.680 --> 49:17.149
until I found somewhere else to go.

49:21.353 --> 49:22.487
I'm sorry.

49:24.152 --> 49:27.523
I hope you know how much
I've loved being here.

49:31.363 --> 49:32.497
Where are you going?

49:32.498 --> 49:34.799
Aren't I kicked out of the program?

49:34.800 --> 49:38.270
Of course not. You're my top student.

49:45.844 --> 49:48.479
No, I-I can't.

49:48.480 --> 49:50.081
It's... it's not a lot,

49:50.082 --> 49:52.550
but it'll get you through next week.

49:52.551 --> 49:54.686
Hopefully, by then, you can
find another arrangement.

49:54.687 --> 49:56.454
I can't take your money, Dr. Masters.

49:56.455 --> 49:58.057

51:19.238 --> 51:21.305
Better.

51:21.306 --> 51:22.273
Much better.

51:22.274 --> 51:25.678
A headache still, but other than that...

51:27.146 --> 51:29.547
I hope I didn't miss too much at work.

No.
