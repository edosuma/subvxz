WEBVTT

00:13.240 --> 00:17.839
-It's strange with only one chair.
-Yes, it is quite different.

00:19.199 --> 00:21.000
-How are you?
-Fine.

00:21.679 --> 00:24.039
-This way, we are a bit closer.
-True.

00:24.960 --> 00:25.960
Here.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.679
-How are you?
-Fine.

00:29.760 --> 00:34.119
I'm fine, I feel great compared
to the other pregnancy, when I was...

00:34.200 --> 00:37.679
I mean, I was resting,
I was on bed rest the last month,

00:37.759 --> 00:42.399
-so it was completely different.
-With the risk of premature birth?

00:42.439 --> 00:47.960
I was induced in the 37th week,
so it's like was giving birth in two days.

00:48.039 --> 00:53.719
It looked like we could have the same
problem now, but we haven't, thank God.

00:53.799 --> 00:57.759
Leo's pregnancy was really difficult
for me because

00:58.399 --> 01:04.239
I was becoming a parent for the first time
and I was afraid I wasn't up for it,

01:04.359 --> 01:08.680
I couldn't do it.
This time I'm already a parent,

01:08.799 --> 01:14.799
I'm proud of the parent I am. I can be
a parent. I can't wait for her to be born.

01:14.879 --> 01:19.799
This time I don't feel as worried.
I mean, I know we'll make some mistakes,

01:19.920 --> 01:22.920
but we'll try
and be the best possible parents.

01:23.039 --> 01:27.799
And this is beautiful because it means
you have created a mental space

01:27.879 --> 01:29.480
for the baby you're expecting.

01:29.560 --> 01:35.479
I won't think of it until Sanremo is over.
I'm not focusing my energy on that.

01:35.560 --> 01:39.159
Are you focusing on Sanremo now?

01:39.640 --> 01:44.359
Yes. My thoughts are mainly
focusing on that.

01:44.439 --> 01:48.240
His battles are becoming more
and more mine,

01:48.319 --> 01:54.319
and Fede knows how tense I get
feeling his challenges as mine.

01:55.039 --> 01:58.719
The official fitting of all the outfits
Fede will wear in Sanremo

01:58.799 --> 02:03.879
is the only opportunity to spend
some time together before Fede leaves.

02:04.519 --> 02:06.079
Let's hope for the best.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.240
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

02:14.319 --> 02:15.560
How about that

02:15.599 --> 02:18.719
And now we're expanding the family
A little more

02:18.800 --> 02:19.960
Like a yo-yo

02:20.039 --> 02:23.439
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

02:23.520 --> 02:28.120
So kiss me, silly
And the show begins

02:28.159 --> 02:29.680
The Ferragnez

02:38.319 --> 02:42.560
I'm here today to pay a visit to Filippo,
one of my dearest friends.

02:42.599 --> 02:45.159
-Hi, love!
-Hi, love! What a big belly.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.159
Today I'm wearing something a bit looser,
but it shows anyway.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.240
You look amazing.

02:50.319 --> 02:52.120
Fil is a longtime friend.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.039
We met on the first day
of our first year of high school

02:56.159 --> 02:58.199
and we've been best friends ever since.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.599
-Is Fede nervous?
-He is, but he seems mentally prepared.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.159
-The other day we went to rehearsals.
-I know. With Leo as well?

03:06.240 --> 03:10.960
It was nice. No, I went with Leo before
that, when he caused a lot of trouble.

03:11.039 --> 03:13.360
-Shall we do the medley?
-Yes.

03:13.439 --> 03:15.919
Do you know what would be cool?

03:16.360 --> 03:17.360
Francesca and Fedez prepare the cover
for their second performance in Sanremo

03:17.439 --> 03:19.520
In the first song we stand still.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.800
For the second one,
I was thinking to move like this...

03:22.879 --> 03:26.639
Don't love me because I live in the shadow

03:26.719 --> 03:29.800
Don't love me because

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
It's hilarious.

03:31.079 --> 03:35.560
He's there now, rehearsing with Francesca.
I'm so anxious.

03:35.639 --> 03:38.479
I'm anxious because I'm afraid

03:38.560 --> 03:42.360
of having contractions. It's a bit soon
because it would be the 37th week,

03:42.439 --> 03:43.599
so it's unlikely.

03:44.159 --> 03:48.759
Let's hope it doesn't happen, it would be
a shame for him to bail on the Festival.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.240
Don't love me because I live in the shadow

03:52.319 --> 03:56.479
Rehearsals in Sanremo are very important.
I rely totally on Francesca,

03:56.560 --> 03:58.920
as she's the better singer
of the two of us.

04:00.159 --> 04:01.159
Like a thought

04:01.240 --> 04:03.280
So I have no choice.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.919
Of happiness

04:08.000 --> 04:10.080
I'm shitting myself anyway, though.

04:10.159 --> 04:11.400
Happiness

04:13.360 --> 04:15.000
-It's perfect.
-How was it?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.360
-Super cool.
-Let's take a look at it.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.399
I think it's hilarious.

04:19.879 --> 04:24.319
Fabio and Barbara, my PA,
are organizing my baby shower.

04:24.360 --> 04:29.240
I want it to be a surprise, I don't want
to know anything before I get there.

04:29.319 --> 04:31.920
-I love it!
-Ready.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.079
I am Alessandra Grillo,
I work as an event planner

04:35.199 --> 04:39.600
and a wedding planner,
and for Chiara I organized both events.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.000
This time she put me in charge
of the baby shower,

04:44.120 --> 04:48.639
the party for the imminent birth
of her baby girl.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.120
-We'll leave the setting neutral.
-Right.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.800
Not to give away any detail.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.720
Chiara knows very little about
the baby shower. She only knows the time

04:57.800 --> 05:01.639
and the location.
The rest will be a surprise for her.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.199
The theme is "Boss Baby Shower."

05:04.240 --> 05:08.199
"Boss baby shower." Okay.
This is the name of the event

05:08.319 --> 05:13.160
and it will be written on a sign
placed above the rainbow.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.040
This is the room.
The setting will be done in that corner.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.319
We got this, which is the nappy test.

05:21.439 --> 05:24.680
-Does the nappy go on the balloon?
-On the balloon, yes.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.519
Not on a real baby?
I mean, not a real baby.

05:28.079 --> 05:33.319
I didn't mean an actual baby. A doll.
It'd be funny, with the little legs.

05:33.399 --> 05:37.600
-I prefer the doll.
-A female doll.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.879
-Yes, of course.
-So, the memories of the clouds.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.600
The balloons.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.560
-Exactly.
-We got the balloons. Great!

05:46.480 --> 05:48.240
How cool!

05:48.920 --> 05:50.240
It's hilarious, guys.

05:51.639 --> 05:53.639
You can feel in the air

05:53.720 --> 05:58.920
Everybody moves behind it.
The band. Great, it works.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.079
We have the choreography as well.

06:02.079 --> 06:08.000
Federico, this is a time of great changes,
and it seems you're experiencing anxiety

06:08.079 --> 06:11.560
in your private,
but also in your professional life.

06:12.240 --> 06:16.360
Routines kill me, so, from an artistic
point of view, I need change.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.360
I've always changed everything.

06:19.439 --> 06:24.279
With my new team, we have been trying

06:24.360 --> 06:28.480
to focus on me more than on others.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
However, I was coming from a time

06:31.639 --> 06:37.319
when I had lost everything, from
an artistic point of view. This year I got

06:38.079 --> 06:43.759
all the performances available,
because I need to be on stage.

06:44.079 --> 06:49.159
So Sanremo means to be able to be naked

06:49.959 --> 06:51.600
without exposing your flank.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.560
This is great!

06:53.680 --> 06:57.279
Or without having to worry
about your exposed flank.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.159
Okay, yes, yours was better.

07:00.639 --> 07:03.519
I'll be the host as well. Hello.

07:03.839 --> 07:08.079
Two of my dearest friends, Angi and Vero,
are here for a coffee together.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.600
Fil, Vero, and Angi are all involved

07:11.680 --> 07:15.519
in my projects, even future ones.
I hope they'll always be here.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.480
I hope I don't give birth during
the Festival, after the text from Ali.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.199
Yesterday she wrote,
"When are you giving birth?"

07:22.319 --> 07:26.480
and I said, "I think around mid-March,
maybe the end of March." And she replied,

07:26.600 --> 07:29.519
"How nice if you give birth
in Sanremo with Fede!" I said,

07:29.600 --> 07:33.399
"Darling, I hope not. I won't be
in Sanremo, I will be in Milan,

07:33.480 --> 07:35.279
but I hope not, it's too soon!"

07:35.519 --> 07:40.000
And she went on, "I feel it, it will be
great." I could only repeat, "No!"

07:40.159 --> 07:43.079
I don't know how well
Fede will do in Sanremo,

07:43.159 --> 07:46.480
I don't know if he'll get through
the experience in a relaxed way.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.360
He's focused on getting rid of his fears
and approaching this Festival

07:50.439 --> 07:56.439
the best he can, being proud of what
he's done. The result won't matter.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.399
He's done everything. He's had therapy,

07:59.879 --> 08:04.439
he has taken singing lessons, he has
focused for months in order to get ready,

08:04.519 --> 08:06.480
so this is his goal right now.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.800
-And...
-So what we can get from this is that

08:11.439 --> 08:12.839
-he feels...
-Sure.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.120
...he's almost gambling
a piece of his life.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.120
MILANO - VIA LARGA
MUSCHIO SELVAGGIO HEADQUARTERS

08:19.199 --> 08:22.720
-Hi, Fede, how are you?
-Fine, we changed location.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.839
True, we always had our sessions at home.
Where do you want to sit?

08:26.920 --> 08:28.639
-You tell me. Here?
-Yes.

08:28.720 --> 08:34.720
I think the numerologist represents
my way to get rid of some anxiety.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.639
I believe it and I don't.

08:36.759 --> 08:39.120
-Let's see.
-Go ahead. What do they say?

08:40.200 --> 08:42.480
-What do you want to talk about?
-Sanremo.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.120
Do we know the dates of the performances?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.080
Those are important.

08:47.399 --> 08:49.639
From the second to the sixth of March.

08:49.759 --> 08:52.399
The dates are good.
The communication is powerful.

08:52.519 --> 08:56.840
-It'll be even better if it's a love song.
-It's a love song. We got it.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.519
On the third it will be even better.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.399
I don't think I'm singing on the third.

09:04.159 --> 09:07.200
You are lucky,
all the vibrations are good.

09:07.279 --> 09:09.879
He's only telling me what I want to hear.

09:10.519 --> 09:14.759
This helps me approach the event
in a more relaxed way.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.720
Who are you singing with?

09:16.759 --> 09:18.440
Francesca

09:18.519 --> 09:19.840
Michielin.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
The numerologist!

09:21.120 --> 09:22.200
Her date of birth?

09:22.360 --> 09:26.639
Francesca Michielin was born
on February 25th, 1995.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.879
There's a nice connection,
you understand each other on the stage.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.639
This is very good.
It will allow you to relax.

09:34.720 --> 09:35.960
Can I get a prediction?

09:36.039 --> 09:38.600
-A prediction about what?
-About the result.

09:39.159 --> 09:40.399
The result will be good,

09:40.519 --> 09:44.360
-but you always aim high.
-No, I don't want to win. But...

09:44.720 --> 09:48.440
-if I do, it will be great.
-You won't get last.

09:48.519 --> 09:52.519
We can even go as far as to say,
among the first seven.

09:52.639 --> 09:55.600
-Good.
-I think it will go very well in Sanremo.

09:55.879 --> 09:58.639
-Okay, let's hope so.
-You'll see.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.519
Good Lord.

10:01.759 --> 10:02.840
Fantastic.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.039
Francesca and I talked to him separately.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.960
-He told me about the pink.
-He told her to wear pink.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.240
And I'll do that.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.240
How stressful, guys.
We had to shoot the video.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.080
I'm about to shoot the videoclip
of "Chiamami Per Nome," with Franceschina.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.159
THEATRE

10:21.240 --> 10:22.480
TIEFFE
MENOTTI THEATRE

10:22.519 --> 10:25.080
We visit several Milanese theatres.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.080
Second day of shooting,
I went to buy Rolling Stone

10:30.159 --> 10:33.879
and inside I found something very funny.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.720
I'll read a couple of lines
written by Dargen,

10:36.759 --> 10:40.240
"I'm writing about Fedez,
although I'm no expert.

10:40.879 --> 10:43.480
"I accepted the invitation
from the press office

10:43.600 --> 10:47.480
"as it's a women-only one and lately
I haven't spoken much to women."

10:49.240 --> 10:53.879
Dargen is a person
who caught me in a very...

10:53.960 --> 10:55.120
JACOPO D'AMICO
ARTIST AND COMPOSER

10:55.200 --> 11:00.679
dramatic moment in my life in general,
but also in my artistic life,

11:00.759 --> 11:04.720
and he gave me a new lease of life,
like in Pulp Fiction,

11:04.799 --> 11:06.960
the adrenalin syringe in the chest.

11:07.039 --> 11:11.039
"Fede is a strong character. It's no
coincidence he was born in Rozzano.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.879
"He attended Liceo Umberto Boccioni
in Milan, just like my aunt Rosaria."

11:16.360 --> 11:20.080
He simplified things
and wrote a masterpiece. He's like that.

11:20.159 --> 11:26.120
"If you don't answer the door 'cause
you're touching yourself in the shower,

11:26.360 --> 11:30.840
Fedez kicks it down. He doesn't do it to
ruin your day. He is truly worried."

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
Dargen is like a spiritual artistic guide.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.519
"Every couple of years
he becomes a father."

11:38.159 --> 11:42.279
How do you see Federico in this transition
with the growing family?

11:42.759 --> 11:46.000
He is much calmer. What I love about Fede

11:46.279 --> 11:50.039
is how protective he is, especially
when it comes to important things.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.600
I know he would fight

11:53.679 --> 11:57.559
300% for me. I think
it's very important, in a relationship,

11:57.679 --> 12:01.320
knowing that person
will always be there for you.

12:01.399 --> 12:03.159
It is really important for you.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.080
-True. Now I get emotional.
-It is touching.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.360
-It's true.
-Because it is precious, Chiara,

12:09.440 --> 12:12.000
and because
it cannot be taken for granted.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.679
FEBRUARY 19 2021
BABY SHOWER

12:29.919 --> 12:32.039
The last time we were all together,

12:32.320 --> 12:34.200
I don't think I can remember it.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
-Wow!
-Wonderful!

12:36.679 --> 12:38.000
It is wonderful!

12:38.080 --> 12:42.279
After the first awkward seconds,
we loosen up

12:42.360 --> 12:46.840
and remember we are here
to say to a friend how much we love her.

12:47.919 --> 12:51.840
-Hello!
-You look beautiful, darling, a bonbon.

12:52.759 --> 12:57.399
We're going to blindfold you
for the surprise.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.159
It was funny to blindfold her.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.679
Push the button.

13:02.919 --> 13:06.200
She was completely unaware
of where she was.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.240
Yes. Come... Come forward.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.799
Will it be a great victory? It always is!

13:10.960 --> 13:13.080
How stressful, guys, I can't see.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.840
Surprise, it's a boy!

13:16.000 --> 13:18.759
-They've been making fun of you.
-There's two of them!

13:21.519 --> 13:23.120
-Okay. Go.
-Here we are.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.440
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful!

13:27.519 --> 13:30.200
Obviously, since you are a boss babe,

13:30.320 --> 13:33.879
we could only think of a Boss Baby Shower.

13:35.320 --> 13:40.639
So beautiful. Amazing.
Shall we go in? Yes, go ahead.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.320
-It's so beautiful!
-Here we are!

13:46.200 --> 13:47.639
Hi, guys!

13:49.519 --> 13:53.039
Hello. It's so cute!

13:53.120 --> 13:56.360
It's the first time
I'm having an official baby shower.

13:56.679 --> 14:01.000
It was amazing to see everyone
and to celebrate this event together.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.200
-Cheers, guys!
-To the baby girl!

14:04.480 --> 14:07.559
It looks like Chiara
really appreciated the surprise.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.559
FRANCESCA
CHIARA'S SISTER

14:08.960 --> 14:11.759
She better like pink.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.279
She looked very happy.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.480
Okay, I feel Leo's eyes or mouth.

14:15.559 --> 14:17.600
Take Leo with Marina's hair.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.879
Let's start with Marina's hair.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.720
Marina, you are with us!

14:23.799 --> 14:25.960
-Exactly.
-The eyes.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.120
For the eyes, I'd choose Leo's or mine.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.399
-Get Fede's.
-No.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.240
-I think Fede is the down part.
-Baby has a piercing.

14:32.320 --> 14:33.960
Fede's mouth.

14:34.879 --> 14:37.279
-It's already quite disturbing.
-The nose.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.440
-What about the nose?
-Mine!

14:39.519 --> 14:40.679
Okay, Vale.

14:40.759 --> 14:43.200
She'll have Chiara's eyes, Fede's mouth,

14:43.279 --> 14:44.279
VALENTINA
CHIARA'S SISTER

14:44.360 --> 14:45.600
nice full lips.

14:45.679 --> 14:47.600
It's got a beard, take it off!

14:47.679 --> 14:50.200
Blonde hair, like all of us.

14:50.279 --> 14:54.799
Even if she won't look like this,
she'll be beautiful for being herself.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.200
Beautiful!

14:57.879 --> 14:59.559
Such a beautiful baby girl.

14:59.639 --> 15:02.000
-Take a picture!
-So beautiful!

15:02.080 --> 15:03.799
"Look what we thought of you."

15:03.879 --> 15:06.720
I think she'll look like Leo.
I imagine her like that.

15:06.799 --> 15:10.120
But maybe she'll surprise us
and will be completely different.

15:10.519 --> 15:14.399
I only hope she'll be healthy,
the rest will be perfect.

15:16.879 --> 15:18.360
In your mind,

15:18.440 --> 15:23.000
can you imagine
who this little girl will be?

15:23.080 --> 15:25.480
What place will she have in your family?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.960
How can I tell? We're talking about
a relationship I have to establish

15:32.039 --> 15:34.200
with someone I still have to get to know.

15:34.279 --> 15:38.879
I don't want to have expectations.
It's always nice to see what happens

15:38.960 --> 15:42.799
without any expectation.
It's difficult to guess

15:43.080 --> 15:46.399
how they will be,
how you can relate to them.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.200
I have never thought about it,
I only hope everything goes well.

15:51.279 --> 15:55.600
Take Leone.
Nowadays I have a relationship with him

15:55.679 --> 15:57.759
that I couldn't have back then.

15:58.039 --> 16:02.600
Even now, looking at Leo, even though he's
the person I love most in the world,

16:02.679 --> 16:05.480
I find it strange to think
that Fede and I made him.

16:05.559 --> 16:08.200
It's a strange concept, in my opinion.

16:08.279 --> 16:11.200
-It's magic.
-Yes, it is magic and it seems...

16:11.840 --> 16:16.120
Rationally, you know it's true, but
irrationally you think it's not possible.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.559
It is right not to have many expectations,

16:18.919 --> 16:23.320
not to burden the new baby
with excessive fantasies.

16:23.919 --> 16:29.399
However, be careful about each person's
role when there'll be four of you.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.720
-Shall we play a nappy game?
-Blindfolded!

16:33.799 --> 16:36.039
The nappy challenge!

16:36.120 --> 16:37.080
Go, Marti!

16:37.639 --> 16:40.000
One, two, three,
let's start the challenge.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.720
Go, go, go.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.440
-Go, Marti!
-Be careful, it's pooping!

16:47.639 --> 16:50.519
Well done,
Marti is already quite experienced.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.879
Go, darling!

16:51.960 --> 16:53.720
Where's the other baby?

16:55.679 --> 16:58.039
Next? Vale, come on!

16:58.120 --> 17:01.240
Excuse me, I have a crying baby.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.639
-Of course.
-Where is the nappy?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.279
-Have you lost the nappy?
-Come on!

17:07.799 --> 17:09.799
-Here, here.
-Fra!

17:09.920 --> 17:14.759
With the exception of Martina, I wouldn't
know whose the next baby shower will be.

17:14.799 --> 17:18.319
Maybe we need a bit more time,
the others are not ready yet.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
-The head is gone.
-Vale is very delicate!

17:23.279 --> 17:25.680
-Done!
-Well done.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.960
-Go.
-Vale, what have you done?

17:31.079 --> 17:32.960
Where is the nappy?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.519
Come on.

17:34.559 --> 17:36.440
Did I put it in the right place?

17:36.519 --> 17:39.319
In my opinion, the next baby shower

17:39.440 --> 17:41.880
will unexpectedly be Francesca Ferragni's.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.240
-You didn't do it.
-I can't do it.

17:44.319 --> 17:46.759
No, come on!

17:48.960 --> 17:51.799
FEDEZ AND FRANCESCA SHOOT THE VIDEOCLIP
FOR THEIR SONG

17:51.960 --> 17:54.920
Follow Nadia and Gianmario, please.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.559
We need to empty everything,
upstairs as well.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.079
You are all in the frame, even upstairs.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.799
For the song's videoclip,
we thought that...

18:05.279 --> 18:09.319
We didn't want to do the usual videoclip.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.799
We're shooting!

18:10.920 --> 18:15.559
We wanted to do something
that could highlight

18:15.680 --> 18:21.039
all the theatres that don't have
the same privilege that the Ariston has.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.440
We performed
in three empty theatres in Milan.

18:26.519 --> 18:29.440
It was beautiful and unsettling
at the same time,

18:29.519 --> 18:32.720
seeing those large seating areas
covered with plastic.

18:32.799 --> 18:35.240
Maybe it makes sense
to get there without a step.

18:35.319 --> 18:38.000
You are already there. We won't show it.

18:40.039 --> 18:41.440
Perfect, all clear.

18:42.799 --> 18:44.559
Call me by my name

18:44.680 --> 18:47.319
This industry

18:47.559 --> 18:49.720
is much bigger than people think.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.279
So many people work in this industry.

19:02.079 --> 19:04.160
-Beautiful.
-How was it?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.559
The vote from the press.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.440
-Do you want to cry?
-Yes.

19:14.519 --> 19:16.039
These are letters.

19:16.079 --> 19:18.759
-Each one reads their own.
-Each one reads their own.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.799
You can keep that.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.559
"Dear, baby girl,
like Ferri likes to call you..."

19:24.920 --> 19:27.559
"Fil and I have known your mum
for more than 15 years.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.480
Chiara will tell you when we met exactly.
She remembers all dates."

19:31.559 --> 19:34.079
"Your mum is special, she's sharp,

19:34.200 --> 19:37.519
intelligent, and, sometimes,
she is a pain in the ass."

19:37.559 --> 19:40.720
"She'll tell you the little story
of that girl from Cremona

19:40.799 --> 19:43.720
who used to be up
until midnight every night

19:44.200 --> 19:46.680
in order to write her posts, et cetera."

19:46.759 --> 19:50.720
"Independence might be one of the most
important values she can pass to you."

19:50.799 --> 19:54.160
"Always believe in your dreams
and fight for them."

19:54.240 --> 19:59.880
"Be strong and proud, able to turn
every moment into a positive moment.

20:00.039 --> 20:03.559
This, above all,
will be your big victory."

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
So beautiful.

20:05.519 --> 20:10.480
We wanted to wish the baby a life

20:10.559 --> 20:16.200
with a positive outlook,
so be positive, no matter what!

20:16.279 --> 20:19.400
"Dear, baby, you will be here soon.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.799
It seems like yesterday
that the three of us sisters were little

20:22.880 --> 20:24.799
and playing make-believe."

20:25.039 --> 20:30.640
"Siblings grow up hand in hand, knowing
they'll always have each other's back.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.440
Well, don't ever leave that hand,

20:34.519 --> 20:38.200
keep holding it tight,
just like I do with my sisters,

20:38.279 --> 20:41.079
and your journey
will be even more beautiful."

20:41.440 --> 20:45.000
"We can't wait to have you here,
growing up with Leone,

20:45.079 --> 20:47.079
together for the rest of your lives."

20:47.319 --> 20:48.400
So beautiful.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.400
They all made me cry.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.640
I get emotional very easily.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.480
Okay, we can stop crying now.

20:56.799 --> 21:00.200
But I'd say especially my sisters,

21:00.319 --> 21:06.200
because they talked about being sisters.
Leo will have a little sister soon,

21:06.279 --> 21:08.559
so this moved me even more.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.680
-Hello!
-Hi!

21:11.920 --> 21:13.279
Hi, Leo!

21:13.759 --> 21:16.720
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-Hi, Leo!

21:17.400 --> 21:19.000
Are you being shy?

21:19.079 --> 21:21.480
-Come here.
-The aunties are here too.

21:21.559 --> 21:22.559
Come on!

21:22.680 --> 21:28.519
Have you given any thought
to how Leo will manage this change?

21:28.559 --> 21:33.319
Yes, I have thought about it
and it could help him.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.279
-It will help him to gain more maturity.
-Precisely.

21:36.440 --> 21:40.279
It could be the start of an important
maturity process to say,

21:41.200 --> 21:44.079
"I live inside this beautiful bubble,

21:44.200 --> 21:48.440
but I have to be a bit more independent."

21:48.519 --> 21:51.559
Shall we go? Give me a big hug!

21:51.720 --> 21:55.519
Four is much more demanding than three.

21:55.559 --> 21:58.960
Yes. From time to time
I think how strange it will be,

21:59.720 --> 22:04.400
because now we love Leo
in such an extreme way

22:04.480 --> 22:09.599
that it will be strange to feel that
for another baby right away.

22:10.960 --> 22:16.079
Everyone tells me it's the most natural
thing in the world. As if your heart

22:16.440 --> 22:20.119
expanded. I know that I'm giving him
the most beautiful gift

22:20.200 --> 22:23.319
because I grew up with two sisters
and it's been amazing.

22:23.400 --> 22:28.079
I also think, "It won't be the three of us
anymore. There will be a fourth person."

22:28.200 --> 22:31.440
So for him it might be a bit of a shock
in the beginning.

22:31.559 --> 22:36.400
It will be fantastic in the future,
but in the beginning he'll suffer a bit.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.720
-Where is Leo?
-Where is he?

22:38.799 --> 22:39.920
Where has he gone?

22:41.079 --> 22:42.680
Here he is!

22:42.759 --> 22:47.799
Now I can't wait for the delivery.
I can't wait to hold her.

22:48.319 --> 22:51.839
I can't wait for the delivery to be over,

22:51.920 --> 22:54.119
enjoy my girl, and see her with Leo.

23:04.319 --> 23:08.279
Donatella is an icon of Italian fashion.
I have known her for years,

23:08.359 --> 23:10.599
and I've been to many of her events.

23:11.559 --> 23:15.279
Today we're going to do the fitting
of Fede's outfits for Sanremo.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.720
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

23:18.799 --> 23:20.880
-You look beautiful.
-Hi, thank you.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.319
We brought Leo with us
to try on his custom made Versace look.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.759
There is a surprise for Leo too.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.839
-Yes, there is a surprise.
-Look, do you remember?

23:30.920 --> 23:34.079
-I showed it to you...
-Look at this.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.480
Who is this little boy?

23:35.559 --> 23:37.799
-Who is it?
-Is it Leo?

23:37.880 --> 23:40.119
-Yes.
-We made a tuxedo for you.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.759
-Let me show it to you.
-You need to try it on.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.240
-These are all daddy's outfits.
-This is daddy.

23:46.359 --> 23:47.720
Oh, my God, look!

23:49.279 --> 23:51.319
-It's beautiful!
-This is daddy's.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.519
No, this is Leo's.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.359
-This is Leo's.
-We'll dress the same way.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.880
-You are incredibly beautiful.
-Thank you,

23:58.960 --> 24:01.759
-but now I have a big belly.
-It's not that big.

24:01.839 --> 24:05.559
-With Leo my belly was smaller.
-With girls you put on more weight.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.839
Yes, it's true.

24:06.920 --> 24:10.160
Darling, shall we let daddy change
and then we do the fitting?

24:11.000 --> 24:16.279
I would have liked to go,
but I'm due soon and I'm a bit anxious.

24:16.359 --> 24:19.200
-Can you imagine giving birth in Sanremo?
-Exactly.

24:19.359 --> 24:22.680
Donatella Versace is a fucking legend.

24:27.240 --> 24:32.240
She dressed me in more than one occasion
and she's the most easy-going designer.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.240
-Beautiful.
-"L" for Leone, is it clear?

24:36.319 --> 24:37.720
-Of course.
-Sure?

24:37.799 --> 24:40.880
It's clear because
your son is such a character.

24:41.640 --> 24:45.640
Guys, she has her drink
in her own branded glass.

24:49.079 --> 24:52.000
It looks like a contemporary scepter.

24:53.519 --> 24:59.039
She utterly destroys the Italian rap,
trap, dril, gim gim, bonbon scenes.

24:59.559 --> 25:00.640
How is it?

25:01.039 --> 25:04.119
-Wonderful. It's something different.
-Check it out.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.599
It is very different. I like it a lot.

25:07.680 --> 25:12.480
She is easy-going,
despite the big glittered glass.

25:12.559 --> 25:15.480
-We only have to tighten up here a bit.
-Yes.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.200
I choose her because I enjoy myself
a lot in her company.

25:19.279 --> 25:22.519
-You're even more beautiful when pregnant.
-Thank you!

25:22.599 --> 25:23.880
Now I feel a bit...

25:24.240 --> 25:28.960
On the one hand, I hope it will happen
in a couple of weeks.

25:29.039 --> 25:34.200
On the other hand, I'm looking forward
to giving birth because

25:34.279 --> 25:36.839
-the last month is really heavy.
-It is.

25:36.920 --> 25:39.799
Potatoes, shall we go and change?
Hold this.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.680
Leo will dress like me.
I thought it'd be cute

25:42.759 --> 25:47.160
also as a memory for him,
when he will watch the 2021 Festival.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.400
His daddy and himself
dressed like his daddy. So nice.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.759
How handsome!
Look at yourself, how lovely!

25:56.960 --> 26:00.119
-I am Lello, Lello, Lello.
-You are Lello.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.839
-You are Lello.
-Lello! Look!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.359
How beautiful you are!

26:06.880 --> 26:07.799
Smile.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.720
Look, guys.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.079
How handsome!

26:15.519 --> 26:19.039
-I go and change too.
-Come, we'll get your measurements.

26:19.599 --> 26:23.039
-Shall we have the hem out?
-Yes.

26:23.119 --> 26:26.559
-Stand still, darling.
-Be careful, I'm holding the pins.

26:27.119 --> 26:30.440
How many kids can say
they had a fitting with Donatella?

26:30.519 --> 26:32.599
I do it only for Leo.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.480
The only child in the world.

26:34.559 --> 26:38.039
Donatella is crazy for Leo.
She was like an auntie

26:38.119 --> 26:40.640
who welcomed us in her fashion house.

26:41.160 --> 26:44.079
-Check us out.
-Wow!

26:47.880 --> 26:50.519
-You are gorgeous.
-Look, baby, look, mommy.

26:56.079 --> 26:59.319
Seeing Leo dressed as his father
was so sweet.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.359
Super Mario is here.

27:01.440 --> 27:05.880
I'm glad I photographed them together
at the fitting,

27:05.960 --> 27:09.279
because we'll be watching Fede
from home, in Milan.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.039
They won't be together.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.240
-Bye, Leo.
-Bye, Donatella.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.759
Shall we say bye to daddy?

27:20.839 --> 27:22.359
-Bye, my love.
-Bye, my love.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.519
Break a leg. Keep your phone on, please.
And not on silent mode.

27:29.799 --> 27:32.160
-Say goodbye to daddy.
-Say bye to daddy.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.319
-Bye.
-A big hug.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.599
Give him a little kiss.

27:38.559 --> 27:40.640
-Bye, love.
-One big family hug?

27:44.039 --> 27:45.720
-Bye, darling.
-Behave.

27:45.799 --> 27:47.640
-A kiss to the little one.
-Help.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.119
-No, don't strain yourself.
-Go.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.240
Bye, baby.

27:52.319 --> 27:54.279
Fede is setting off for Sanremo.

27:54.359 --> 27:58.440
I'm worried I'll have contractions
and I'll have to go to hospital,

27:58.640 --> 28:02.119
but we agreed that in that case
he'd leave Sanremo and come to Milan.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.519
Bye, daddy.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.480
Let's hope not, I'd like him
to be able to live this experience.

28:07.559 --> 28:09.599
Bye, daddy, we love you so much.

28:13.240 --> 28:17.319
This is the moment my son turns
around and says, "No, daddy, don't go."

28:20.160 --> 28:21.400
Here he goes.

28:23.039 --> 28:25.119
No, he doesn't give a shit.

28:33.559 --> 28:38.319
I'm shitting myself,
I'm totally shitting myself.

28:39.559 --> 28:44.119
I don't mind the chart much.
The problem is that if I get bad reviews,

28:44.200 --> 28:46.720
then I could go into emo mode.

28:48.079 --> 28:49.319
Fucking hell.

28:50.279 --> 28:51.680
Let's hope it all goes well.

28:57.559 --> 29:01.160
You don't look like a woman
who will give birth in the next 48 hours.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.200
Let's hope so. The famous last words.

29:03.359 --> 29:04.359
It's time to start.

29:04.519 --> 29:07.000
Call me by my name

29:08.920 --> 29:10.599
Oh, my beautiful Madonnina

29:11.400 --> 29:15.480
The advice the gynecologist gave me
is to have a lot of sex.

29:15.559 --> 29:17.799
Once I would have been scared, now...

29:18.519 --> 29:19.640
on the opposite.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.920
Vittoria!

29:23.160 --> 29:24.640
You're a rock.

29:24.759 --> 29:26.839
Chiara thinks she's having contractions.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.279
-Okay, should I call? I'll call.
-Call, call.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.160
-Are you sure?
-Of what?

29:33.240 --> 29:35.200
-That she's mine.
-Can you imagine?
