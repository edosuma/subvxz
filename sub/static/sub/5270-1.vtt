01:06.049 --> 01:10.203
Inside a snowflake,
like the one on your sleeve...

01:10.303 --> 01:14.587
there happened a story
you must see to believe.

01:30.865 --> 01:34.853
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos...

01:34.953 --> 01:37.730
lay the small town of Whoville:

01:38.206 --> 01:39.607
The home of the Whos.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.281
Ask any Who,
and they'll have this to say:

01:47.382 --> 01:51.749
"There is no place like Whoville
around Christmas Day."

01:52.262 --> 01:55.087
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed...

01:55.265 --> 01:59.549
and the Whoville band marched
in their Christmas-y best.

02:04.607 --> 02:07.515
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

02:20.498 --> 02:23.359
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant...

02:23.459 --> 02:26.735
and every Saint Fizzin's day,
they ate a Fizz pheasant.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.867
But every Who knew,
from their twelve toes to their snout...

02:30.967 --> 02:35.334
they loved Christmas the most,
without a single Who doubt.

02:39.934 --> 02:42.047
- Farfingle's welcomes you!
- Thank you.

02:42.437 --> 02:45.677
Merry Christmas!
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's!

02:46.524 --> 02:48.802
We got a snoozlephone
for your brother Drew...

02:48.902 --> 02:53.803
and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu,
a muncle for your uncle...

02:53.907 --> 02:57.764
a fant for your aunt
and a fandpa for your cousin Leon.

02:57.952 --> 03:00.101
So, we just need... Cindy?

03:00.205 --> 03:01.689
Sale on Aisle 3!

03:01.789 --> 03:03.650
- Cindy Lou!
- Merry Christmas.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.361
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.
Excuse me.

03:06.461 --> 03:07.993
Cindy Lou? Honey?

03:09.172 --> 03:10.240
- Dad?
- Yeah?

03:10.340 --> 03:12.322
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

03:13.009 --> 03:14.826
This is what Christmas is all about!

03:15.136 --> 03:16.663
Can't you feel it?

03:16.763 --> 03:17.914
Merry Christmas!

03:18.014 --> 03:20.329
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
Wait a second!

03:20.558 --> 03:21.663
Your change!

03:21.935 --> 03:23.751
Another minute closer to Christmas!

03:26.022 --> 03:29.796
And, for the next five minutes only,
99 percent off!

03:42.747 --> 03:47.648
Yes, every Who down in Whoville
liked Christmas a lot...

03:47.961 --> 03:51.735
but the Grinch,
who lived just north of Whoville...

03:52.674 --> 03:54.039
did not.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.580
Get on it, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.

03:59.722 --> 04:03.081
- Hey, Drew, I'll race you!
- Not if I race you first.

04:03.393 --> 04:06.503
Last one to the top
is a stinky old Grinch!

04:08.815 --> 04:12.218
You guys, where are we?
I think we should go back.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.764
What? You're scared of the Grinch!

04:15.405 --> 04:16.557
No!

04:17.156 --> 04:19.435
They say he lives up here in a big cave.

04:19.576 --> 04:22.270
And only comes down
when he's hungry for the taste of...

04:22.537 --> 04:24.520
- Who flesh!
- Drew!

04:25.373 --> 04:29.147
You're scared of the Grinch!
You're scared of the Grinch!

04:30.795 --> 04:32.410
- Are too!
- Am not!

04:35.842 --> 04:37.207
Wait for me!

04:47.896 --> 04:50.673
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.

04:50.773 --> 04:52.471
Do it for me, Stu.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.589
Well done, Max!

05:27.268 --> 05:30.295
Serves them right,
those Yuletide-loving...

05:30.396 --> 05:33.720
sickly-sweet, nog-sucking cheer mongers!

05:35.235 --> 05:37.348
I really don't like them.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.389
No, I don't.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.180
Max!

05:46.204 --> 05:48.317
Get my cloak!

05:49.332 --> 05:52.489
I've been much too tolerant
of these Whovenile delinquents...

05:52.710 --> 05:55.618
and their innocent, victimless pranks.

05:56.506 --> 05:59.413
So, they want to get
to know me, do they?

05:59.926 --> 06:03.332
They want to spend a little quality time
with the Grinch.

06:04.889 --> 06:07.204
I guess I could use a little...

06:07.308 --> 06:09.042
social interaction.

06:18.862 --> 06:20.013
Merry Christmas!

06:20.113 --> 06:21.723
Yeah, you bet.

06:21.823 --> 06:23.604
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

06:26.786 --> 06:27.807
Oh, my.

06:28.037 --> 06:30.697
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.

06:30.874 --> 06:33.651
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.613
The Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season.

06:36.713 --> 06:37.864
Top of the day. Flatfoot.

06:37.964 --> 06:41.451
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

06:41.551 --> 06:42.911
Here's a present for you.

06:43.011 --> 06:46.247
Be sure to run real fast with it.
Come on. Double time. Move.

06:46.347 --> 06:49.291
It could be that his head
wasn't screwed on just right.

06:49.392 --> 06:52.796
Or it could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.555
But I think that
the most likely reason of all...

06:55.732 --> 06:59.636
may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.476
Stranger, won't let you go
till you buy a chapeau!

07:15.418 --> 07:17.531
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?

07:18.463 --> 07:19.484
I guess.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.824
You guess?

07:22.008 --> 07:27.122
It's just, I look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled.

07:27.222 --> 07:29.999
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

07:30.141 --> 07:31.127
Dad!

07:31.810 --> 07:33.459
Dad!

07:36.022 --> 07:38.799
- What happened to you?
- It was the Grinch!

07:44.531 --> 07:46.762
- Grinch?
- What do you want? I mean...

07:46.866 --> 07:48.481
"Grinch? Oh, no!"

07:50.245 --> 07:52.726
Did someone just say, "Grinch"?

07:53.790 --> 07:55.488
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.

07:58.753 --> 07:59.774
Lou.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.411
I don't need to remind you
that this Christmas...

08:06.511 --> 08:09.664
marks the one thousandth Whobilation.

08:09.764 --> 08:11.960
Whoville's most important celebration!

08:12.100 --> 08:15.874
And The Book of Who says, very clearly:

08:17.313 --> 08:19.592
"Every size of Who we can measure...

08:19.732 --> 08:23.637
"knows that Whobilation
is a time we must treasure."

08:23.778 --> 08:26.686
Now, Lou, please tell me
that your boys...

08:27.198 --> 08:29.097
were not up on Mount Crumpit...

08:29.200 --> 08:33.022
provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here...

08:33.163 --> 08:34.398
who hates Christmas!

08:34.664 --> 08:36.361
But it was the Grinch!

08:37.250 --> 08:40.525
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.

08:40.794 --> 08:42.778
It was, and he came after...

08:42.881 --> 08:44.991
I think they were up on the mountain...

08:45.091 --> 08:48.331
playing with matches,
or defacing public property, or...

08:49.637 --> 08:51.122
That's a relief.

08:51.347 --> 08:53.330
All right, you heard the man:

08:53.433 --> 08:56.459
There is no Grinch problem here.

09:04.319 --> 09:07.889
- I need it there by tomorrow.
- Heck of a rush.

09:07.989 --> 09:10.552
Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush.

09:13.411 --> 09:14.599
But, Dad...

09:14.746 --> 09:16.527
I just don't understand something.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.402
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.067
You kids and the Grinch!

09:22.670 --> 09:26.824
You see, Cindy,
the Grinch is a Who, who always...

09:27.008 --> 09:30.201
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a...

09:30.637 --> 09:33.960
- A what?
- Exactly, honey.

09:34.140 --> 09:37.084
And he's a What
who doesn't like Christmas.

09:38.061 --> 09:39.960
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.

09:40.063 --> 09:42.840
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.

09:43.274 --> 09:44.509
Ever!

09:44.609 --> 09:45.714
But why?

09:45.860 --> 09:47.309
Lou, where's my mail?

09:47.529 --> 09:49.725
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.

09:50.031 --> 09:52.097
Lou! I got the wrong mail!

09:53.952 --> 09:56.978
- I'll be right there.
- Lou, we got a problem!

09:57.163 --> 09:59.727
All right, we'll straighten this out.

10:03.086 --> 10:05.781
It'll take them years to sort this out.

10:06.130 --> 10:10.201
This is his and now it's yours,
and this hers and now it's his!

10:12.053 --> 10:13.621
And for the rest of you:

10:15.682 --> 10:17.629
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!

10:17.851 --> 10:20.545
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.

10:20.937 --> 10:22.836
Jury duty!

10:27.360 --> 10:31.514
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room, honey?

10:32.490 --> 10:35.018
- Be careful of the sorting machine, right?
- Yeah.

11:11.946 --> 11:13.265
Gesundheit.

11:22.165 --> 11:23.483
You're the...

11:24.000 --> 11:25.449
The...

11:25.710 --> 11:26.779
The Grinch!

11:30.840 --> 11:32.324
That worked out nicely.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.244
Help!

11:42.727 --> 11:44.544
Help me! Somebody!

11:44.813 --> 11:46.261
Max, let's go.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.887
Our work here is finished.

11:49.192 --> 11:50.261
Help me!

11:51.444 --> 11:53.012
Please help!

11:53.196 --> 11:55.344
That is not a chew toy!

11:55.865 --> 11:56.934
Stop it, Max!

11:57.242 --> 12:00.268
Get that out of your mouth!
You have no idea where it's been!

12:05.208 --> 12:06.277
Help!

12:08.920 --> 12:12.742
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!

12:20.223 --> 12:22.918
There! Give me that!

12:23.101 --> 12:26.337
Don't you know you shouldn't
take things that don't belong to you?

12:26.437 --> 12:28.385
What's your problem?
Are you a wild animal?

12:31.234 --> 12:32.469
Let's go.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.927
Thanks for saving me.

12:41.119 --> 12:42.852
Saving you?

12:43.872 --> 12:45.901
Is that what you think I was doing?

12:49.085 --> 12:50.450
Wrong-o.

12:53.006 --> 12:56.945
I merely noticed that you were
improperly packaged, my dear.

12:59.637 --> 13:00.956
Hold still!

13:01.139 --> 13:02.956
Max, pick out a bow.

13:03.975 --> 13:05.708
Can I use your finger for a second?

13:06.686 --> 13:08.170
Hello! Hello!

13:12.817 --> 13:14.515
- Cindy?
- Dad!

13:16.279 --> 13:17.514
Daddy!

13:18.072 --> 13:19.307
Daddy!

13:19.991 --> 13:21.309
What the hey...?

13:22.535 --> 13:23.604
Honey.

13:24.579 --> 13:25.814
Cindy?

13:26.122 --> 13:27.571
Dad! It was amazing!

13:27.874 --> 13:30.948
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!

13:31.211 --> 13:32.659
I am so proud of you.

13:35.590 --> 13:37.039
Now, that's holiday.

13:37.258 --> 13:40.664
Sweet little Cindy
didn't know what to do.

13:40.803 --> 13:43.711
In her head, bum-tumbled
a conflict or two.

13:44.098 --> 13:47.457
"If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.128
"Maybe he wasn't so bad."

13:50.146 --> 13:52.045
Maybe. Just maybe.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.723
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shopping.

13:59.823 --> 14:02.016
Good, I'm so glad you're home.

14:02.116 --> 14:05.107
I can feel it, Lou. This is the year.

14:05.995 --> 14:10.778
When everybody asks who has the most
spectacular lights in greater Whoville...

14:11.501 --> 14:14.860
they're gonna cry out,
"Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"

14:15.505 --> 14:17.820
Isn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?

14:18.341 --> 14:20.122
It's all for the cause, dear.

14:20.510 --> 14:23.747
And Cindy?
Could you be Mommy's little helper...

14:23.847 --> 14:26.410
and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?

14:26.891 --> 14:29.040
- 'Cause somehow I missed that one.
- Go on!

14:33.773 --> 14:39.006
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.

14:40.238 --> 14:41.603
Not this year.

14:41.823 --> 14:43.266
This year...

14:43.366 --> 14:46.974
I'm gonna beat
that prim, perfect little prissy...

14:47.078 --> 14:48.266
Betty!

14:49.247 --> 14:52.191
- Hi!
- Martha!

14:52.709 --> 14:56.483
My, I've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!

14:56.838 --> 15:00.244
I'd blow every fuse if I tried
to keep up with you, Martha May!

15:00.967 --> 15:03.080
Isn't this antique darling?

15:03.595 --> 15:07.203
It's handcrafted
and almost 100 years old.

15:08.057 --> 15:09.791
Jeez. I'm really impressed!

15:10.977 --> 15:12.960
This, however, is new.

15:25.575 --> 15:27.604
Betty! Sweetie!

15:43.426 --> 15:45.243
Good night, Betty.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.377
- I got it!
- Honey, I've got it.

15:52.477 --> 15:53.546
Hello?

15:54.938 --> 15:57.715
Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?

15:58.316 --> 16:01.224
- I suppose.
- You better go catch it!

16:09.577 --> 16:12.023
That's a good one! That is rich.

16:16.084 --> 16:17.533
Let's go home.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.706
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.168
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.437
There's got to be a better way!

17:10.430 --> 17:12.958
A car would have paid for itself by now!

17:14.809 --> 17:17.006
Goody. Another load coming down.

17:21.858 --> 17:23.638
What's that stench?

17:24.359 --> 17:25.893
It's fantastic!

17:28.448 --> 17:30.062
Max! Grab a bag.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.981
We'll come back for the rest.

17:33.203 --> 17:36.110
Of course, when I say "we,"
I mean "you."

17:37.081 --> 17:40.072
It's amazing
what these Whos just throw away.

17:40.251 --> 17:41.273
Oh, well.

17:42.837 --> 17:46.410
One man's toxic sludge
is another man's potpourri.

17:47.050 --> 17:49.116
I don't know. It's some kind of soap.

18:01.564 --> 18:05.255
"Where are you, Christmas?

18:05.735 --> 18:09.260
"Why can't I find you?

18:09.823 --> 18:14.807
"Why have you gone away?

18:17.747 --> 18:21.687
"My world is changing

18:21.793 --> 18:25.615
"I'm rearranging

18:25.797 --> 18:28.539
"Does that mean Christmas

18:29.300 --> 18:32.659
"changes too?

18:41.646 --> 18:45.301
"Where are you, Christmas?

18:45.733 --> 18:48.677
"Do you remember

18:49.404 --> 18:54.815
"The girl you used to know?

18:56.202 --> 19:01.150
"You and I were so carefree

19:01.708 --> 19:04.652
"Now nothing's easy

19:05.336 --> 19:08.411
"Did Christmas change

19:09.007 --> 19:14.038
"Or just

19:15.013 --> 19:19.297
"me?"

19:46.669 --> 19:47.822
Sweet!

19:57.889 --> 20:00.204
"Be it ever so

20:00.558 --> 20:01.663
"Heinous

20:01.768 --> 20:05.756
"There's no place like home"

20:10.652 --> 20:13.014
First floor, factory rejects.

20:14.405 --> 20:16.721
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!

20:16.825 --> 20:20.100
But we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.

20:20.203 --> 20:23.940
At least I scared the bejeebles
out of that little girl at the post office.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.486
She'll be scarred for life,
if we're lucky.

20:43.101 --> 20:45.167
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.

20:45.353 --> 20:47.466
Must be afraid of reprisals.

20:59.534 --> 21:00.722
Yes!

21:01.077 --> 21:03.273
Down a size and a half!

21:04.789 --> 21:07.401
And this time, I'll keep it off.

21:09.919 --> 21:12.235
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!

21:16.342 --> 21:17.992
There's no stick!

21:18.094 --> 21:19.543
I'm smarter.

21:26.644 --> 21:28.010
Any calls?

21:29.814 --> 21:31.596
You have no messages.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.557
Odd. Better check the outgoing.

21:37.113 --> 21:39.310
If you utter so much as one syllable...

21:39.449 --> 21:43.271
I'll hunt you down
and gut you like a fish!

21:43.995 --> 21:46.393
If you'd like to fax me,
press the star key.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.235
Oh, well.

21:55.673 --> 21:57.490
That's more like it.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.436
Excellent year.

22:20.490 --> 22:22.140
I'll tell you, Max...

22:22.325 --> 22:24.687
I don't know
why I ever leave this place.

22:25.078 --> 22:28.651
I've got all the company
I need right here.

22:30.124 --> 22:31.692
Hello!

22:31.793 --> 22:33.277
Hello!

22:34.212 --> 22:35.482
How are you?

22:35.588 --> 22:36.859
How are you?

22:37.298 --> 22:38.866
I asked you first.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.237
I asked you first.

22:40.635 --> 22:44.705
That's really mature,
saying exactly what I say!

22:45.098 --> 22:48.457
Mature... exactly... what I say...

22:50.061 --> 22:51.082
I'm an idiot!

22:51.646 --> 22:53.545
You're an idiot!

22:56.776 --> 22:57.964
All right, fine.

22:58.069 --> 23:01.556
I'm not talking to you anymore.
In fact, I'm going to whisper.

23:01.656 --> 23:06.023
So that by the time my voice reverberates
off the walls and gets back to me...

23:06.244 --> 23:09.069
I won't be able to hear it!

23:10.373 --> 23:12.521
You're an idiot!

23:24.345 --> 23:26.708
Am I just eating because I'm bored?

23:36.900 --> 23:38.348
Who could that be?

23:40.487 --> 23:43.394
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?

23:43.615 --> 23:44.636
No.

23:45.116 --> 23:48.143
I hear you know some things
about the Grinch.

23:48.244 --> 23:52.018
Cindy Lou had some questions
in her curious heart.

23:52.415 --> 23:56.189
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?

23:56.503 --> 23:59.244
With her dad's blabbacorder
she wouldn't give an inch.

23:59.380 --> 24:03.913
In your own words, please tell me
everything you know about the Grinch.

24:04.385 --> 24:05.870
Where did he come from?

24:07.972 --> 24:10.288
He came the way all Who babies come.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.714
On calm nights...

24:13.853 --> 24:17.793
baby Who girls and tiny Who fellas...

24:18.191 --> 24:23.009
drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas.

24:30.662 --> 24:33.818
Hey, honey, our baby is here!

24:36.000 --> 24:37.900
He looks just like your boss.

24:40.171 --> 24:42.035
So that's how it works.

24:43.299 --> 24:47.667
It was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind blew that night.

25:14.622 --> 25:17.234
We were having
our annual holiday get-together.

25:40.064 --> 25:44.761
It was morning before anybody realized
that he was out there!

25:44.861 --> 25:45.930
The poor dear!

25:46.613 --> 25:47.972
But, you know what?

25:48.072 --> 25:50.138
We knew right away that he was special.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.229
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

25:58.333 --> 26:01.158
Yes, which Christmas cookie
would you like?

26:01.294 --> 26:02.315
Santa.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.240
His first words!

26:05.340 --> 26:07.618
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

26:07.842 --> 26:10.370
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?

26:18.019 --> 26:19.551
Santa, bye-bye!

26:24.400 --> 26:26.466
He was a wonderful...

26:27.195 --> 26:28.560
whatever he was.

26:29.030 --> 26:32.436
And we raised him
like any other Who child:

26:32.742 --> 26:34.559
With a deep love of Christmas.

26:38.164 --> 26:41.274
Don't forget, tomorrow
is our big Christmas gift exchange.

26:41.751 --> 26:45.739
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.

26:46.673 --> 26:47.861
The...

26:47.966 --> 26:49.533
Grinch...

26:50.593 --> 26:53.370
He had no sense of color coordination.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.872
Although I hardly remember him.
I didn't have time to socialize.

26:58.476 --> 27:00.625
I was far too busy with my...

27:01.312 --> 27:02.417
studies.

27:02.605 --> 27:05.632
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?

27:07.861 --> 27:09.724
And if the truth be told, he...

27:10.071 --> 27:11.140
He liked Martha.

27:13.074 --> 27:14.973
Martha was my girlfriend.

27:17.829 --> 27:21.982
I don't like discussing this Grinch
so very close to Christmas, but...

27:22.208 --> 27:24.944
maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why...

27:25.044 --> 27:26.861
Put your back into it!

27:27.672 --> 27:30.497
I tried to take him under my wing.

27:31.176 --> 27:35.163
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

27:38.808 --> 27:41.336
He had hair. Not pleasant.

27:43.354 --> 27:44.589
He shed.

27:44.939 --> 27:45.961
Not right.

27:48.485 --> 27:51.844
You know, Christmas
is my favorite time of year.

27:52.363 --> 27:54.180
I just love the colors.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.059
The red...

27:56.409 --> 27:58.143
and the green.

28:01.706 --> 28:03.854
Did I have a crush on the Grinch?

28:05.126 --> 28:06.147
Of course not.

28:06.628 --> 28:08.028
I didn't ask you that.

28:10.632 --> 28:11.736
Right.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.490
For some reason,
when he came home that day...

28:15.595 --> 28:18.752
he really got into the Christmas spirit
for the first time.

28:19.807 --> 28:20.829
Perfect!

28:24.354 --> 28:25.458
Whoopsie!

28:32.237 --> 28:34.468
What a lovely family heirloom!

28:46.626 --> 28:48.443
The fires of love!

28:51.130 --> 28:53.493
This will be perfect
on the top of her tree.

28:53.633 --> 28:56.494
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

29:02.851 --> 29:06.210
I want you all to look
your best tomorrow.

29:07.188 --> 29:09.087
You don't have a chance with her.

29:09.190 --> 29:11.967
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

29:27.709 --> 29:29.407
Has everyone given their gifts?

29:30.545 --> 29:32.326
- I haven't.
- What?

29:39.679 --> 29:41.626
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

29:43.099 --> 29:45.378
Why do you have a bag on your head?

29:46.144 --> 29:49.966
Probably because he's embarrassed
by that hideodorous gift.

29:51.774 --> 29:53.093
Mr. Grinch...

29:53.443 --> 29:55.805
please take the bag off.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.385
Yes, you.

29:58.490 --> 29:59.642
Take it off.

30:04.704 --> 30:06.485
Put the book down.

30:11.002 --> 30:12.534
And your foot.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.163
Look at that hack job!

30:28.686 --> 30:30.669
Stupid present!

30:31.481 --> 30:32.846
Stupid tree!

30:33.233 --> 30:36.093
I hate Christmas!

30:36.361 --> 30:38.509
- The anger.
- The fury!

30:39.155 --> 30:40.687
The muscles!

30:52.418 --> 30:56.952
It was a horrible day
when they were so cruel to him.

30:57.549 --> 30:58.701
And...

31:00.343 --> 31:01.993
I could hardly bear it.

31:18.319 --> 31:21.144
I hate Christmas! I hate it!

31:22.323 --> 31:25.101
And that was the last time
we ever saw him.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.101
The very last time.

32:21.508 --> 32:25.116
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...

32:25.512 --> 32:27.624
he stood outside his cave...

32:28.056 --> 32:30.085
hating the Whos.

32:30.725 --> 32:32.458
Alphabetically.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.966
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...

32:37.273 --> 32:38.343
I...

32:38.733 --> 32:42.092
hate you!

32:45.532 --> 32:48.855
Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you.

32:49.327 --> 32:51.438
Hate, hate, hate. Hate, hate, hate.

32:51.538 --> 32:52.986
Double hate.

32:53.623 --> 32:57.064
Loathe entirely!

33:03.925 --> 33:05.706
Nutcrackers?

33:06.511 --> 33:09.371
It's their Whobilation.

33:09.472 --> 33:12.036
He snarled with a sneer.

33:12.934 --> 33:16.625
Tomorrow is Christmas!
It's practically here.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.383
Max!

33:19.566 --> 33:22.426
Fetch me my sedative.

33:23.736 --> 33:26.680
Now to take care
of those pesky memories.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.144
"Whobilation, plentiful
with candy canes and pies

33:32.245 --> 33:35.315
"I can't wait to get there
to eat some google fries

33:35.415 --> 33:37.065
"Whobilation, Whobilation"

33:37.292 --> 33:38.443
- Dad?
- Yeah.

33:38.543 --> 33:42.613
I've been thinking about the Whobilation
and I may do something drastic.

33:42.714 --> 33:44.824
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.

33:44.924 --> 33:47.452
- Where did she go?
- Honey!

33:47.552 --> 33:49.166
Honey! Hi!

33:50.263 --> 33:54.120
Look, I just found the cutest light
for my Christmas display.

33:55.477 --> 33:57.708
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.

34:16.706 --> 34:18.900
And now, the nominations...

34:19.000 --> 34:21.735
for that Who among us
who best typifies...

34:21.835 --> 34:25.360
the qualities of Whodom and Whodery...

34:25.465 --> 34:29.702
the Whoville holiday cheermeister!

34:38.061 --> 34:40.920
Do I hear a nomination?

34:41.022 --> 34:42.340
I nominate the Grinch!

34:44.442 --> 34:47.303
- The Grinch?
- The Grinch?

34:49.489 --> 34:51.433
My, my, my.

34:51.533 --> 34:54.891
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!

34:55.995 --> 34:57.563
Thank you.

34:59.082 --> 35:00.317
Cindy?

35:03.044 --> 35:05.442
Let me quote a verse...

35:06.130 --> 35:08.030
from The Book of Who.

35:08.675 --> 35:09.826
Thank you.

35:09.926 --> 35:15.290
"The term 'Grinchy' shall apply
when Christmas spirit is in short supply."

35:15.390 --> 35:18.749
Now, I ask you: Does that sound
like our holiday cheermeister?

35:19.144 --> 35:23.590
True, Mr. May-Who.
But The Book of Who says this too:

35:23.690 --> 35:26.217
"No matter how different
a Who may appear...

35:26.317 --> 35:29.225
"he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer."

35:32.699 --> 35:35.518
Yes, the book also says, the...

35:35.618 --> 35:36.978
"The award...

35:37.078 --> 35:39.898
"cannot go to the Grinch, because...

35:39.998 --> 35:43.820
"sometimes things
get the lead-pipe cinch."

35:44.043 --> 35:46.359
You made that up! It doesn't say that.

35:46.921 --> 35:48.655
No, it does.

35:49.966 --> 35:50.987
What page?

35:54.304 --> 35:57.330
Lost my place, but it's...

35:57.849 --> 35:59.000
It's in here!

35:59.100 --> 36:01.044
But the book does say:

36:01.144 --> 36:04.882
"The cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.

36:05.231 --> 36:08.468
"And it goes to the soul at Christmas
who needs it most."

36:08.568 --> 36:11.179
And I believe that soul is the Grinch.

36:12.280 --> 36:16.647
And if you're the Whos I hope you are,
you will too.

36:17.785 --> 36:19.353
She's right!

36:24.626 --> 36:25.730
Fine.

36:26.085 --> 36:29.527
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination...

36:29.631 --> 36:31.364
why, it's up to you.

36:31.466 --> 36:34.160
But I am telling you...

36:34.260 --> 36:37.619
the Grinch will never come down.

36:37.722 --> 36:40.630
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.

36:40.767 --> 36:42.833
Well, more or less.

36:43.770 --> 36:46.547
"Deck your heart with jollity

36:46.648 --> 36:49.259
"Style your smile all Christmas-y

36:49.359 --> 36:52.011
"Flick some flocking on the tree

36:52.111 --> 36:54.593
"Let there be Whobilation

36:55.073 --> 36:57.850
"Bake the fruitcake, egg the nog

36:57.951 --> 37:00.645
"Feed the flaming Who-ltide log

37:00.787 --> 37:03.481
"Baste the beast and gulp the grog

37:03.581 --> 37:06.323
"Let there be Whobilation

37:06.459 --> 37:09.236
"Tick, tock, tick, tock

37:09.337 --> 37:12.073
"Counting down the Christmas clock

37:12.173 --> 37:14.737
"Old, young, big, small"

37:22.308 --> 37:24.540
Blast this Christmas music.

37:26.020 --> 37:28.299
It's joyful and triumphant.

37:29.357 --> 37:31.221
Must drown them out!

37:40.785 --> 37:42.684
Not working!

37:44.414 --> 37:47.855
The whipperwinds whipped
high above the Who town.

37:47.959 --> 37:51.650
A trip or a slip
you'd slide all the way down.

37:52.338 --> 37:55.575
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.

37:55.675 --> 38:00.042
She'd invite the Grinch herself,
that brave Cindy Lou.

38:08.438 --> 38:11.595
Play, monkey! Play!

38:23.953 --> 38:25.770
Howdy?

38:29.042 --> 38:30.609
Mr. Grinch?

38:33.671 --> 38:35.535
Mr. Grinch!

38:40.303 --> 38:41.491
Hello?

39:07.789 --> 39:09.154
Excuse me.

39:24.848 --> 39:26.545
Hello...

39:27.058 --> 39:28.507
little girl.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.582
How dare you enter...

39:31.855 --> 39:34.336
the Grinch's lair?

39:34.440 --> 39:37.384
The impudence! The audacity!

39:37.902 --> 39:40.346
The unmitigated gall!

39:40.446 --> 39:42.513
You called down the thunder...

39:42.615 --> 39:46.057
now, get ready for the boom!

39:46.911 --> 39:50.851
Gaze into the face of fear!

39:53.251 --> 39:54.735
Mr. Grinch...

39:55.628 --> 39:57.572
my name is Cindy Lou Who.

39:57.672 --> 39:58.693
You see?

39:58.798 --> 40:03.117
Even now the terror
is welling up inside you.

40:04.345 --> 40:05.913
I'm not scared.

40:06.139 --> 40:10.257
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.

40:12.437 --> 40:14.004
I don't think so.

40:15.148 --> 40:16.299
Doubt?

40:16.399 --> 40:20.256
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!

40:20.945 --> 40:24.435
Now you're doomed!

40:32.081 --> 40:34.025
Run for your life...

40:34.125 --> 40:37.531
before I kill again!

40:40.048 --> 40:41.580
I'm a psycho!

40:44.594 --> 40:46.992
Danger! Danger!

40:56.189 --> 40:58.302
Maybe you need a time-out.

41:03.947 --> 41:05.217
Kids today.

41:05.323 --> 41:08.231
So desensitized by movies
and television.

41:09.035 --> 41:10.353
What do you want?

41:11.663 --> 41:14.654
Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you...

41:15.500 --> 41:17.862
to be holiday cheermeister.

41:20.338 --> 41:23.412
- "Holiday Whobie-what-y"?
- Cheermeister.

41:24.509 --> 41:26.788
"Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends."

41:31.140 --> 41:32.625
That's a good one.

41:33.434 --> 41:37.422
I know you hate Christmas,
but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?

41:37.605 --> 41:41.260
- Don't care.
- I myself am having some Yuletide doubts.

41:41.943 --> 41:45.430
But maybe if you reunite
with the Whos and be a part of Christmas...

41:45.530 --> 41:48.516
"Maybe if you reunite with the Whos
and be a part of Christmas."

41:48.616 --> 41:49.638
Grow up!

41:49.742 --> 41:51.770
Then maybe it'll be
all right for me, too!

41:51.870 --> 41:53.354
I'm sorry, your session is over.

41:53.454 --> 41:56.608
Please make another appointment
with the receptionist on the way out.

41:56.708 --> 41:59.105
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.

42:04.632 --> 42:06.366
Award?

42:08.761 --> 42:11.871
You never mentioned an award!

42:12.432 --> 42:14.461
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.

42:14.726 --> 42:16.589
- And I won?
- You won!

42:17.687 --> 42:20.298
- That means there were losers.
- I guess.

42:20.398 --> 42:24.682
- So, if you come...
- A town full of losers!

42:25.236 --> 42:26.685
I like it.

42:27.530 --> 42:30.094
Was anyone emotionally shattered?

42:31.034 --> 42:34.274
Come on, a minute ago
I couldn't shut you up! Details, details!

42:35.538 --> 42:36.773
The Mayor wasn't happy.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.354
Oh, no.

42:41.002 --> 42:42.735
Martha May will be there.

42:44.506 --> 42:45.990
She will?

42:47.258 --> 42:48.873
And she'll see me.

42:49.469 --> 42:50.538
A winner.

42:52.096 --> 42:55.834
She'll be on me like fleegle flies
on a flat-faced floogle horse.

42:55.934 --> 43:00.502
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby,
but the G train has left the station.

43:00.939 --> 43:02.838
So, will you come?

43:03.483 --> 43:04.884
All right.

43:05.735 --> 43:08.512
I don't know if it's
that adorable twinkle in your eye...

43:08.613 --> 43:10.181
or that nonconformist streak...

43:10.323 --> 43:13.896
that reminds me of a younger,
less hairy me.

43:14.244 --> 43:16.143
But you've convinced me.

43:16.329 --> 43:21.314
Who knows? This Whobilation
could change my entire outlook on life!

43:21.960 --> 43:23.693
- Really?
- No.

43:57.704 --> 43:59.603
There you are, honey.

43:59.956 --> 44:02.152
You can make snow angels later.

44:02.709 --> 44:04.691
We can't be late for the Whobilation!

44:08.214 --> 44:09.657
The nerve of those Whos.

44:09.757 --> 44:13.199
Inviting me down there
on such short notice.

44:13.303 --> 44:16.875
Even if I wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it.

44:19.350 --> 44:22.128
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.

44:22.228 --> 44:25.136
"4:30, stare into the abyss.

44:25.899 --> 44:28.047
"5:00, solve world hunger...

44:28.151 --> 44:30.178
"tell no one.

44:30.278 --> 44:32.177
"5:30, jazzercise.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.306
"6:30, dinner with me."
I can't cancel that again.

44:35.783 --> 44:39.024
"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."

44:39.287 --> 44:40.605
I'm booked.

44:40.747 --> 44:43.983
If I bumped the loathing to 9:00,
I'd have time to lay in bed...

44:44.083 --> 44:47.822
stare at the ceiling
and slip slowly into madness.

44:48.463 --> 44:50.362
But what would I wear?

45:10.693 --> 45:12.972
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!

45:14.447 --> 45:16.679
Sicko!

45:17.742 --> 45:18.763
Stupid.

45:18.910 --> 45:19.931
Ugly.

45:20.036 --> 45:21.485
Out of date.

45:23.081 --> 45:24.607
This is ridiculous.

45:24.707 --> 45:28.197
If I can't find something nice to wear,
I'm not going!

45:46.396 --> 45:48.260
That's it, I'm not going.

46:00.493 --> 46:04.860
It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister
of the Year Award!

46:11.337 --> 46:14.613
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!

46:17.218 --> 46:18.702
He isn't here.

46:19.345 --> 46:20.498
What?

46:21.389 --> 46:23.122
He didn't show?

46:24.809 --> 46:26.708
Who could have predicted this?

46:27.979 --> 46:32.049
All right. I'll swing by for a minute,
allow them to envy me...

46:32.150 --> 46:35.307
grab a handful of popcorn shrimp,
and blow out of there.

46:35.820 --> 46:39.428
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?

46:39.991 --> 46:41.808
How dare they?

46:42.577 --> 46:43.895
All right, I'll go.

46:43.995 --> 46:45.479
But I'll be fashionably late.

46:45.663 --> 46:47.895
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

46:48.041 --> 46:49.062
Yes!

46:50.877 --> 46:52.242
Definitely not!

46:52.712 --> 46:55.074
All right. I've made my decision!

46:55.632 --> 46:57.994
I'm going, and that's that.

46:59.552 --> 47:00.953
Had my fingers crossed.

47:05.058 --> 47:07.669
Maybe I should flip a coin!

47:15.318 --> 47:18.392
I guess the award goes to...

47:18.613 --> 47:19.931
the runner-up.

47:21.699 --> 47:25.770
That's right. A man for whom
Christmas comes not once a year...

47:26.496 --> 47:28.360
but every minute of every day.

47:28.832 --> 47:31.277
A handsome, noble man.

47:32.001 --> 47:34.150
A man who
has had his tonsils removed twice!

47:35.588 --> 47:37.120
That's an interesting story.

47:37.549 --> 47:39.448
You see, what happened was...

47:54.399 --> 47:55.634
Hello, Martha.

47:55.859 --> 47:56.880
He made it!

47:57.235 --> 47:58.340
- Cindy.
- Honey!

48:22.385 --> 48:23.406
Look...

48:26.055 --> 48:27.872
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

48:29.893 --> 48:31.959
I believe I'm here to...

48:33.646 --> 48:36.803
accept an award of some kind.

48:39.152 --> 48:42.926
And the child mentioned a check.

48:43.406 --> 48:45.970
- No, I didn't.
- All right, then, give me the award.

48:46.075 --> 48:48.058
Come on, while I'm young!

48:48.203 --> 48:52.605
Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister,
you'll get your award.

48:52.707 --> 48:56.742
But first, a little family reunion.

48:57.795 --> 49:00.949
They nursed you. They clothed you.

49:01.049 --> 49:02.575
Here they are...

49:02.675 --> 49:05.500
your old biddies!

49:07.055 --> 49:09.618
Are you two still living?

49:10.308 --> 49:11.673
We missed you!

49:12.769 --> 49:15.001
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.

49:15.355 --> 49:18.049
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, I can't!

49:18.149 --> 49:19.764
I can't do that!

49:22.362 --> 49:24.143
Don't touch me there!

49:31.996 --> 49:34.190
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

49:34.290 --> 49:35.691
Chair of Cheer?

49:35.792 --> 49:37.573
What's the Chair of Cheer?

49:37.794 --> 49:39.904
You didn't tell me
about the Chair of Cheer.

49:40.004 --> 49:42.402
Please, Mr. Grinch.

49:43.591 --> 49:45.159
No. I can't do it, honestly.

49:45.260 --> 49:47.076
I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon!

49:47.345 --> 49:49.205
It's that time of year.

49:49.305 --> 49:51.621
The Cheermeister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!

49:52.600 --> 49:54.711
Put me down! I mean it!

49:54.811 --> 49:56.171
I've got a lawyer.

49:56.271 --> 49:58.253
There'll be hell to pay!

49:59.649 --> 50:02.719
First, you'll put
your taste buds to the test...

50:02.819 --> 50:07.222
as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!

50:07.824 --> 50:09.768
- Mine first.
- I really don't know...

50:09.868 --> 50:11.601
No, mine's the best!

50:11.995 --> 50:13.645
You'll enjoy this!

50:14.622 --> 50:16.688
This is not pudding.

50:17.584 --> 50:18.854
What is it?

50:20.795 --> 50:23.156
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

50:23.256 --> 50:25.322
Christmas conga!

50:25.508 --> 50:28.411
Look at the time.
I really should be getting back.

50:28.511 --> 50:30.410
All right!

50:35.185 --> 50:36.835
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!

50:37.979 --> 50:39.132
No.

50:44.486 --> 50:46.468
Fudge Judge.

50:48.865 --> 50:50.397
Made it myself.

50:50.783 --> 50:52.351
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.

50:52.952 --> 50:54.140
Okay.

50:54.829 --> 50:56.646
Put it in. Bring it on!

50:57.332 --> 50:59.192
Is that all you got?

50:59.292 --> 51:01.191
Is that all you got? Come on.

51:07.217 --> 51:08.665
Out of the way, slow-mo!

51:10.345 --> 51:11.414
Excuse me.

51:24.692 --> 51:27.053
He's number one in the sack race run!

51:27.153 --> 51:30.346
Number one! I'm number one!

51:30.490 --> 51:32.556
I'm number one!

51:33.076 --> 51:36.269
No child can beat the Grinch!

51:41.376 --> 51:43.157
I beat you.

51:51.511 --> 51:52.829
He won!

51:54.597 --> 51:57.917
And now it's time for the moment
we've all been waiting for.

51:58.017 --> 52:00.581
Yes! My award.

52:00.770 --> 52:02.714
- Write the check.
- There's no check.

52:02.814 --> 52:06.301
Are you sure? Because I thought
I heard someone mention a check.

52:06.401 --> 52:09.137
I said, there's no check.
And now it's time...

52:09.237 --> 52:11.552
for Present Pass-it-on!

52:11.990 --> 52:15.099
As always, we start
with our Cheermeister.

52:23.710 --> 52:26.273
The gift of a Christmas shave.

52:40.602 --> 52:42.549
Look at that hack job!

52:52.697 --> 52:55.392
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!

52:56.910 --> 52:57.979
Good times.

52:59.329 --> 53:03.186
And now, I have a little something
for the love of my life.

53:04.417 --> 53:05.901
Martha May...

53:08.254 --> 53:11.281
please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.

53:19.474 --> 53:20.958
Augustus...

53:21.893 --> 53:23.674
If you agree to be my wife...

53:23.895 --> 53:28.179
along with a lifetime supply of happiness,
you'll also receive this:

53:31.027 --> 53:33.473
It's a new car!

53:34.447 --> 53:37.936
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!

53:40.078 --> 53:41.645
What do you say, Martha?

53:42.413 --> 53:45.404
You got 20 seconds on the clock.

53:48.711 --> 53:49.733
I...

53:53.216 --> 53:55.697
These gifts are quite dazzling.

54:06.020 --> 54:08.418
Of course they are.

54:09.399 --> 54:11.298
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

54:11.526 --> 54:14.967
That's what it's always been about!

54:16.239 --> 54:17.260
Gifts!

54:17.866 --> 54:18.935
Gifts.

54:19.117 --> 54:21.514
Gifts, gifts, gifts.

54:22.328 --> 54:24.607
You want to know what happens
to your gifts?

54:24.789 --> 54:27.566
They all come to me. In your garbage.

54:28.001 --> 54:29.366
You see what I'm saying?

54:29.544 --> 54:31.491
In your garbage!

54:32.589 --> 54:37.371
I could hang myself with all the bad
Christmas neckties I found at the dump!

54:38.678 --> 54:40.079
And the avarice.

54:41.848 --> 54:44.874
The avarice never ends!

54:44.976 --> 54:46.875
"I want golf clubs." "I want diamonds."

54:46.978 --> 54:50.918
"I want a pony, so I can ride it twice,
get bored, and sell it to make glue."

54:51.649 --> 54:56.716
Look, I don't want to make waves,
but this whole Christmas season is...

54:56.905 --> 54:59.267
stupid, stupid, stupid!

55:00.700 --> 55:02.481
There is, however...

55:03.328 --> 55:06.105
one teeny-tiny...

55:06.664 --> 55:08.279
Christmas tradition...

55:08.833 --> 55:10.317
I find...

55:11.002 --> 55:13.744
quite meaningful.

55:19.093 --> 55:20.459
Mistletoe.

55:20.887 --> 55:23.664
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!

55:32.273 --> 55:35.015
Somebody's fabulous!

55:38.696 --> 55:40.229
All right, your turn! Go on!

55:48.498 --> 55:49.686
- Let's go!
- No!

55:50.291 --> 55:51.776
Excuse me, old-timer.

55:52.710 --> 55:54.527
Mind if I wet my whistle?

55:59.425 --> 56:01.075
That's my good stuff!

56:09.060 --> 56:11.671
Burn, baby! Burn!

56:24.993 --> 56:27.438
The Whomanity!

56:27.954 --> 56:29.272
- Let's go! Come on!
- No, wait!

56:29.539 --> 56:32.020
- Do something.
- Right!

56:39.757 --> 56:41.574
Calling all units. Calling all units.

56:45.722 --> 56:47.087
Taxi!

56:49.350 --> 56:51.831
It's because I'm green, isn't it?

56:56.608 --> 56:58.140
Halt!

56:59.611 --> 57:02.555
Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along?

57:02.822 --> 57:05.054
You might want to scooch over.

57:07.118 --> 57:08.686
You did the right thing.

57:17.086 --> 57:18.701
Out of the way!

57:28.515 --> 57:30.912
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

57:55.083 --> 57:57.030
It's gonna blow!

58:14.644 --> 58:16.128
You fellas all right?

58:16.229 --> 58:18.010
How about a nice hat?

58:18.481 --> 58:19.634
Lou?

58:28.741 --> 58:30.060
I'm hurt, Lou.

58:31.411 --> 58:33.726
I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily.

58:33.830 --> 58:36.572
But you and your family...

58:37.584 --> 58:39.151
I'm so...

58:39.252 --> 58:40.820
disappointed.

58:42.672 --> 58:44.987
Can we just get back to Christmas...

58:45.383 --> 58:47.745
the way it should be?

58:48.636 --> 58:50.168
Grinch-less?

58:50.722 --> 58:53.000
Merry Christmas!

58:54.058 --> 58:56.374
Merry Christmas!

59:00.315 --> 59:04.433
I just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.

59:07.489 --> 59:09.305
I quite enjoyed that.

59:09.407 --> 59:11.354
I hope I get another invite soon.

59:16.789 --> 59:18.149
Come on, come on!

59:18.249 --> 59:20.398
Good thing we have a spare.

59:22.587 --> 59:25.531
Suffering snorkelblatz!

59:25.965 --> 59:28.114
They're relentless!

59:33.723 --> 59:37.378
Only four hours till Christmas!

59:39.187 --> 59:43.009
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow
all the Who girls and boys...

59:43.316 --> 59:46.509
would wake bright and early
and rush for their toys.

59:46.611 --> 59:49.518
And then, the noise!

59:49.739 --> 59:53.561
The noise, noise, noise!

59:54.160 --> 59:56.309
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.

59:56.412 --> 59:58.561
They'll blow their floo-flounders.

59:58.748 --> 01:00:02.487
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!

01:00:03.378 --> 01:00:07.031
Then Whos young and old
would sit down to a feast.

01:00:07.131 --> 01:00:09.743
And they'll feast and they'll feast.

01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:13.499
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!

01:00:13.763 --> 01:00:15.662
They'll eat their Who pudding.

01:00:16.015 --> 01:00:19.624
And rare Who roast beast!

01:00:19.978 --> 01:00:24.297
But there's something
I just cannot stand in the least.

01:00:24.649 --> 01:00:25.837
Oh, no.

01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:29.765
I'm speaking in rhyme!

01:00:35.034 --> 01:00:38.144
Blast you Whos!

01:00:42.584 --> 01:00:46.867
And the more the Grinch thought
of what Christmas would bring...

01:00:47.213 --> 01:00:49.445
the more the Grinch thought:

01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:52.456
I must stop this whole thing.

01:00:54.012 --> 01:00:57.999
Why, for year after year
I've put up with it now!

01:00:58.183 --> 01:01:01.588
I must stop this Christmas from coming!
But how?

01:01:02.812 --> 01:01:05.127
I mean, in what way?

01:01:08.359 --> 01:01:12.477
"Christmas is goin' to the dogs

01:01:13.781 --> 01:01:17.555
"We're scoffing down
the turkey and the grog

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.811
"Things are looking
very good, it's true"

01:01:24.334 --> 01:01:27.693
Are you having a holly, jolly...

01:01:28.546 --> 01:01:30.328
Christmas?

01:01:31.799 --> 01:01:33.248
Wrong-o!

01:01:51.277 --> 01:01:53.224
If you're not going to help me...

01:01:53.571 --> 01:01:55.768
then you might as well...

01:01:56.658 --> 01:01:58.023
Then he got an idea.

01:01:58.868 --> 01:02:01.017
An awful idea.

01:02:01.871 --> 01:02:04.103
The Grinch got a wonderful...

01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:06.523
awful idea.

01:02:06.835 --> 01:02:11.202
I know just what to do.

01:02:19.722 --> 01:02:22.286
The Grinch laughed in his throat.

01:02:23.017 --> 01:02:25.545
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.

01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:31.474
And he chuckled and clucked...

01:02:31.818 --> 01:02:34.095
at this great Grinchy trick.

01:02:34.195 --> 01:02:38.135
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.

01:02:39.951 --> 01:02:42.977
"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch

01:02:44.706 --> 01:02:48.480
"You really are a heel

01:02:49.043 --> 01:02:53.156
"You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel

01:02:53.256 --> 01:02:55.784
"Mr. Grinch

01:02:56.509 --> 01:02:58.326
"You're a bad banana

01:02:58.761 --> 01:03:02.203
"With a greasy black peel

01:03:07.937 --> 01:03:10.928
"Just face the music, you're a monster

01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:13.839
"Mr. Grinch, yes, you are

01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:18.389
"Your heart's an empty hole

01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:22.555
"Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.058
"Mr. Grinch

01:03:26.206 --> 01:03:28.484
"I wouldn't touch you with a

01:03:29.584 --> 01:03:33.109
"thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole"

01:03:44.807 --> 01:03:47.964
I asked for three-quarters,
not five-eighths.

01:03:48.186 --> 01:03:49.635
Stay focused!

01:03:55.944 --> 01:03:59.267
"You know, if you asked
the who's who of Whoville

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.265
"No one would deny it"

01:04:24.138 --> 01:04:26.584
Air bag is a little slow.

01:04:29.018 --> 01:04:31.546
But that's what these tests are for!

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.344
"You're a vile one

01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:36.342
"Mr. Grinch

01:04:37.485 --> 01:04:41.390
"You have termites in your smile

01:04:42.031 --> 01:04:46.478
"You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:48.809
"Mr. Grinch

01:04:50.081 --> 01:04:52.358
"Given the choice between you

01:04:52.458 --> 01:04:55.817
"I'd take the seasick crocodile"

01:05:18.693 --> 01:05:22.301
Fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now.

01:05:23.281 --> 01:05:25.141
Talk about a recluse.

01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:29.609
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches any flak for it!

01:05:30.955 --> 01:05:33.697
Probably lives up there
to avoid the taxes.

01:05:35.752 --> 01:05:38.315
Merry Christmas!

01:05:40.131 --> 01:05:41.402
Oopsie.

01:05:42.717 --> 01:05:44.830
Forgot about the reindeer.

01:05:45.678 --> 01:05:48.338
Did that stop the old Grinch?

01:05:49.015 --> 01:05:50.665
No.

01:05:50.767 --> 01:05:52.833
The Grinch simply said:

01:05:53.228 --> 01:05:55.791
If I can't find a reindeer...

01:05:56.606 --> 01:05:59.846
I'll make one instead.

01:06:04.239 --> 01:06:07.929
Oh, Max!

01:06:11.204 --> 01:06:13.187
So he called his dog Max...

01:06:13.915 --> 01:06:15.814
and he took some red thread...

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.442
and tied a big horn on top of his head.

01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:24.112
All right.

01:06:24.634 --> 01:06:27.495
You're a reindeer.
Here's your motivation.

01:06:27.804 --> 01:06:30.748
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose,
nobody likes you.

01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:33.793
Then one day,
Santa picks you and you save Christmas.

01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:38.627
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.

01:06:38.731 --> 01:06:41.212
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.

01:06:41.359 --> 01:06:43.472
You hate Christmas!
You're gonna steal it!

01:06:43.903 --> 01:06:47.428
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.399
Action!

01:06:53.079 --> 01:06:54.232
Brilliant!

01:06:54.664 --> 01:06:56.647
You reject your own nose...

01:06:56.749 --> 01:06:59.402
because it represents the
glitter of commercialism!

01:06:59.502 --> 01:07:01.279
Why didn't I think of that?

01:07:01.379 --> 01:07:03.575
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.

01:07:13.558 --> 01:07:14.876
That...

01:07:15.018 --> 01:07:16.418
feels...

01:07:16.519 --> 01:07:18.632
good.

01:07:29.991 --> 01:07:32.768
Here goes nothin', hot dog!

01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:39.729
Wow!

01:07:53.848 --> 01:07:56.246
This is nuts!

01:07:58.269 --> 01:08:00.335
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!

01:08:00.647 --> 01:08:02.795
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

01:08:11.616 --> 01:08:13.065
We're gonna die!

01:08:13.201 --> 01:08:14.934
We're gonna die!

01:08:15.286 --> 01:08:18.728
I'm going to throw up,
and then I'm gonna die!

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:24.200
Mommy, tell it to stop!

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:45.930
Almost lost my cool there.

01:08:51.156 --> 01:08:55.357
All their windows were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.

01:08:55.577 --> 01:08:59.814
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...

01:08:59.956 --> 01:09:02.609
when he came to the first
little house on the square.

01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:04.774
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:13.746
Betty?

01:09:14.053 --> 01:09:15.287
- Betty?
- What?

01:09:15.388 --> 01:09:17.371
Did you hear something?

01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:20.627
It's Santa!

01:09:20.727 --> 01:09:22.709
Go right back to sleep.

01:09:28.067 --> 01:09:31.426
Come on, Max. It's our first stop.

01:09:31.654 --> 01:09:33.886
The old Grinchy Claus hissed.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:36.810
And he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:40.269
He'd slide down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.

01:09:40.537 --> 01:09:43.648
But if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:47.654
He's planning a double-twisting
interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half...

01:09:47.754 --> 01:09:49.404
with a combo tuck and pike.

01:09:49.506 --> 01:09:51.120
High degree of difficulty.

01:09:59.182 --> 01:10:02.541
He got stuck only once,
for a moment or two.

01:10:02.644 --> 01:10:06.334
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.

01:10:16.282 --> 01:10:19.143
Then he stuck his head
out of the fireplace flue.

01:10:20.537 --> 01:10:22.815
A little more stealth, please.

01:10:23.206 --> 01:10:25.650
Where the little Who stockings
all hung in a row.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:26.855
These stockings...

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.899
he grinned...

01:10:28.002 --> 01:10:29.819
are the first thing to go.

01:10:30.255 --> 01:10:32.700
Okay, fellas. Show time.

01:11:04.497 --> 01:11:06.646
Then he slunk to the icebox.

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:09.028
Slunk?

01:11:11.254 --> 01:11:15.158
He eyed the Whos' feast.
He took the Who pudding.

01:11:16.342 --> 01:11:18.455
He took the roast beast.

01:11:19.012 --> 01:11:20.081
Hike!

01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:23.746
He cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.754
Why, that Grinch,
he even took their last can of Who hash.

01:11:28.855 --> 01:11:32.380
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.

01:11:33.026 --> 01:11:34.676
And now...

01:11:34.777 --> 01:11:36.677
grinned the Grinch...

01:11:38.615 --> 01:11:40.392
I'll stuff up the tree.

01:11:40.492 --> 01:11:43.518
And the Grinch grabbed the tree,
and he started to shove...

01:11:44.204 --> 01:11:47.894
when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:49.400
Excuse me.

01:11:55.423 --> 01:11:58.663
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter...

01:11:58.885 --> 01:12:01.413
who'd got out of bed
for a cup of cold water.

01:12:01.554 --> 01:12:04.960
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?

01:12:05.517 --> 01:12:09.456
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick...

01:12:11.064 --> 01:12:13.971
he thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick.

01:12:14.526 --> 01:12:15.761
Why...

01:12:15.902 --> 01:12:18.727
my sweet little tot.

01:12:18.988 --> 01:12:20.603
The fake Santa Claus lied.

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:23.306
There's a light on this tree...

01:12:23.993 --> 01:12:25.394
that won't...

01:12:25.495 --> 01:12:27.442
light on one side.

01:12:27.914 --> 01:12:31.984
So I'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:39.238
I'll fix it up there...

01:12:39.634 --> 01:12:43.289
and I'll bring it back here.

01:12:45.139 --> 01:12:47.087
Santa, what's Christmas really about?

01:12:47.392 --> 01:12:49.173
Vengeance!

01:12:50.937 --> 01:12:52.207
I mean...

01:12:54.816 --> 01:12:56.300
presents...

01:12:57.402 --> 01:12:58.851
I suppose.

01:13:02.907 --> 01:13:04.689
I was afraid of that.

01:13:06.202 --> 01:13:09.359
And his fib fooled the child.

01:13:09.664 --> 01:13:12.988
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink...

01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:15.488
and he sent her to bed.

01:13:23.261 --> 01:13:24.282
Santa?

01:13:24.971 --> 01:13:28.295
- What?
- Don't forget the Grinch.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.047
I know he's mean and hairy and smelly.

01:13:33.021 --> 01:13:35.502
His hands might be cold and clammy.

01:13:36.983 --> 01:13:40.472
But I think he's actually kind of sweet.

01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:41.931
Sweet?

01:13:49.662 --> 01:13:51.444
You think he's sweet?

01:13:52.332 --> 01:13:54.149
Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:14:01.216 --> 01:14:04.123
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.875
Nice kid.

01:14:06.804 --> 01:14:09.416
Bad judge of character.

01:14:10.517 --> 01:14:13.294
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

01:14:21.402 --> 01:14:24.723
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

01:14:24.823 --> 01:14:28.976
On their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire.

01:14:29.118 --> 01:14:31.855
And the one speck of food
that he'd left in the house...

01:14:31.955 --> 01:14:35.314
was a crumb that was even
too small for a mouse.

01:14:38.419 --> 01:14:42.656
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant...

01:14:42.841 --> 01:14:46.615
around each Who home,
and he took every present.

01:14:57.856 --> 01:14:58.925
Clearance sale.

01:14:59.065 --> 01:15:01.012
Everything must go.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.063
What now?

01:15:51.618 --> 01:15:52.639
Martha...

01:15:52.869 --> 01:15:56.726
have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?

01:15:57.957 --> 01:15:59.774
No, silly!

01:16:03.838 --> 01:16:07.446
But it's an experience
that I've always longed for.

01:16:07.842 --> 01:16:09.540
Kiss me, you fool!

01:17:32.343 --> 01:17:34.373
What are you laughing at...

01:17:35.221 --> 01:17:37.168
Rudolph?

01:17:38.308 --> 01:17:40.335
It's all you, Maxie!

01:17:40.435 --> 01:17:43.838
3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit...

01:17:43.938 --> 01:17:47.546
he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it.

01:17:57.452 --> 01:18:00.645
We did it!

01:18:05.877 --> 01:18:07.860
We did it! We did it!

01:18:08.463 --> 01:18:10.492
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?

01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:16.202
They'll be waking up now.

01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:22.163
And I know just what they'll do.

01:18:22.977 --> 01:18:25.090
All those Whos...

01:18:25.522 --> 01:18:27.220
down in Whoville...

01:18:27.357 --> 01:18:29.672
will all cry.

01:18:47.794 --> 01:18:50.405
What an embarrassment! I've been robbed!

01:19:20.493 --> 01:19:22.725
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.

01:19:30.587 --> 01:19:33.150
I wonder who could have done this.

01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:36.575
Tell you people one thing:

01:19:37.218 --> 01:19:38.750
Invite the Grinch...

01:19:39.387 --> 01:19:41.286
destroy Christmas.

01:19:41.598 --> 01:19:43.497
Invite the Grinch...

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.377
destroy Christmas!

01:19:49.564 --> 01:19:52.300
But did anyone listen to me?

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.094
- I did.
- No.

01:19:54.194 --> 01:19:57.220
You choose to listen...

01:19:57.363 --> 01:20:01.980
to a little not-to-be-taken
seriously girl...

01:20:02.952 --> 01:20:06.192
who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:10.865
Cindy, I hope you're very proud...

01:20:11.294 --> 01:20:12.564
of what you've done.

01:20:21.638 --> 01:20:23.371
If she isn't, I am.

01:20:25.517 --> 01:20:27.380
I'm glad he took our presents.

01:20:29.312 --> 01:20:31.129
- What?
- I...

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:36.013
- I'm glad.
- He's glad.

01:20:36.903 --> 01:20:39.847
You're glad.
You're glad everything is gone.

01:20:41.157 --> 01:20:45.227
You're glad that the Grinch
virtually wrecked...

01:20:45.328 --> 01:20:47.772
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.

01:20:47.872 --> 01:20:49.606
Is that what I'm hearing?

01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:52.861
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor...

01:20:52.961 --> 01:20:56.948
because it isn't about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights.

01:20:57.048 --> 01:21:00.288
That's what Cindy's been trying
to tell everyone.

01:21:00.844 --> 01:21:03.037
And me. She's been trying to tell me.

01:21:03.137 --> 01:21:06.543
What is wrong with you? This is a child.

01:21:07.433 --> 01:21:09.044
She's my child.

01:21:09.144 --> 01:21:11.969
And she happens to be right, by the way.

01:21:20.572 --> 01:21:24.773
I don't need anything more for Christmas
than this right here, my family.

01:21:28.037 --> 01:21:31.396
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas!

01:21:32.876 --> 01:21:36.863
Merry Christmas,
you hunk of burnin' Who!

01:21:44.304 --> 01:21:45.918
Give me a break.

01:21:53.771 --> 01:21:54.876
Merry Christmas!

01:22:07.494 --> 01:22:08.682
Mr. Grinch?

01:22:10.121 --> 01:22:12.065
Mr. Grinch?

01:22:12.165 --> 01:22:14.984
Now for the final note in my symphony...

01:22:15.084 --> 01:22:18.075
of downright nasty not-niceness!

01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:21.661
The crescendo of my odious opus!

01:22:27.764 --> 01:22:30.292
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

01:22:30.809 --> 01:22:35.259
The bellowing
of the bitterly bummed out!

01:22:35.814 --> 01:22:38.970
It'll be like music to my ears!

01:22:47.325 --> 01:22:51.527
Then the Grinch heard
a sound rising over the snow.

01:22:51.663 --> 01:22:55.697
It started in low.
Then it started to grow.

01:22:58.086 --> 01:23:00.567
But the sound wasn't sad.

01:23:01.214 --> 01:23:03.991
Why, this sounded merry.

01:23:04.884 --> 01:23:07.282
But it was merry.

01:23:07.428 --> 01:23:08.581
Very.

01:23:08.805 --> 01:23:12.709
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small...

01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:16.091
were singing
without any presents at all.

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:24.721
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming.

01:23:25.029 --> 01:23:26.051
It came.

01:23:26.156 --> 01:23:29.396
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

01:23:33.288 --> 01:23:34.820
Mr. Grinch?

01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:41.446
And the Grinch, with his Grinch
feet ice-cold in the snow...

01:23:41.546 --> 01:23:44.205
stood puzzling and puzzling.

01:23:44.549 --> 01:23:46.697
How could it be so?

01:23:46.968 --> 01:23:48.749
It came without ribbons!

01:23:49.179 --> 01:23:51.541
It came without tags!

01:23:51.806 --> 01:23:55.165
It came without packages, boxes or bags!

01:23:58.229 --> 01:24:01.049
And he puzzled and puzzled...

01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:03.630
till his puzzler was sore.

01:24:06.029 --> 01:24:09.933
Then the Grinch thought of something...

01:24:10.074 --> 01:24:11.772
he hadn't before.

01:24:12.035 --> 01:24:13.270
Maybe...

01:24:14.537 --> 01:24:15.772
Christmas...

01:24:15.872 --> 01:24:17.771
he thought...

01:24:20.043 --> 01:24:23.698
doesn't come from a store.

01:24:27.467 --> 01:24:29.081
Maybe Christmas...

01:24:30.428 --> 01:24:31.829
perhaps...

01:24:37.727 --> 01:24:40.173
means a little bit more.

01:25:13.555 --> 01:25:15.122
Help me!

01:25:15.932 --> 01:25:17.120
I'm...

01:25:18.143 --> 01:25:19.591
feeling!

01:25:26.401 --> 01:25:28.549
And what happened then...

01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:31.390
well, in Whoville they say...

01:25:31.656 --> 01:25:34.309
that the Grinch's small heart...

01:25:34.409 --> 01:25:38.349
grew three sizes that day.

01:26:09.736 --> 01:26:12.976
What's happening to me?

01:26:36.471 --> 01:26:37.789
I'm all...

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.922
toasty inside.

01:26:48.107 --> 01:26:50.505
And I'm leaking.

01:26:53.822 --> 01:26:54.891
Oh, Max.

01:26:58.368 --> 01:27:00.564
I love you!

01:27:08.628 --> 01:27:11.702
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!

01:27:12.382 --> 01:27:13.996
Get out of here!

01:27:14.175 --> 01:27:16.039
One step at a time.

01:27:24.435 --> 01:27:27.545
No. The sleigh. The presents.

01:27:27.730 --> 01:27:29.090
They'll be destroyed!

01:27:29.190 --> 01:27:30.556
And I care!

01:27:30.817 --> 01:27:33.594
What is the deal?

01:27:34.445 --> 01:27:35.930
Wait!

01:27:37.448 --> 01:27:38.719
This can't happen!

01:27:38.825 --> 01:27:41.982
It shouldn't! It couldn't!
It mustn't! It wouldn't!

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.101
Not now, not then, not ever again!

01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:56.790
No!

01:28:46.142 --> 01:28:47.163
Oh, well.

01:28:47.977 --> 01:28:50.458
It's just toys, right?

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:53.590
Hi, Mr. Grinch!

01:28:55.819 --> 01:28:57.469
Cindy Lou!

01:28:57.570 --> 01:28:59.886
What are you doing up there?

01:29:00.615 --> 01:29:04.555
I came to see you.
No one should be alone on Christmas.

01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:22.032
No!

01:29:53.168 --> 01:29:56.158
I got you, Cindy Lou!

01:29:56.713 --> 01:29:57.817
You did it!

01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:42.118
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

01:30:59.818 --> 01:31:01.432
Are you all right?

01:31:01.736 --> 01:31:02.971
Are you kiddin'?

01:31:03.071 --> 01:31:05.516
The sun is bright
and the powder's bitchin'!

01:31:05.698 --> 01:31:08.179
Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive!

01:31:15.667 --> 01:31:17.365
I'd better slow this buggy down!

01:31:21.256 --> 01:31:24.911
- We're gonna crash!
- Now you listen to me, young lady!

01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:28.038
Even if we're horribly mangled...

01:31:28.805 --> 01:31:30.752
there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.

01:31:41.776 --> 01:31:43.141
What is it?

01:31:43.653 --> 01:31:45.018
Help!

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.930
- Cindy!
- Grinch?

01:31:49.617 --> 01:31:51.066
My baby!

01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:56.311
Grab an end.

01:31:56.666 --> 01:31:59.194
By the way, these lights
match your outfit perfectly.

01:32:01.921 --> 01:32:04.034
This could be more difficult
to negotiate.

01:32:04.549 --> 01:32:06.781
Heads up, Whoville!

01:32:07.051 --> 01:32:08.833
Hurry! Here he comes!

01:32:10.054 --> 01:32:12.582
Out of the way! I have no insurance!

01:32:15.935 --> 01:32:17.170
Yeah!

01:32:24.152 --> 01:32:25.220
Run for your lives!

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.386
Watch out, I can't stop!

01:32:29.324 --> 01:32:31.686
- Daddy, move!
- Dad, move it!

01:32:42.754 --> 01:32:43.906
Thanks for the help.

01:32:44.214 --> 01:32:46.243
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Cindy, honey!

01:32:46.424 --> 01:32:48.454
Merry Christmas...

01:32:49.010 --> 01:32:50.328
one and all!

01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:51.491
Cindy!

01:32:53.556 --> 01:32:54.577
Mommy!

01:33:02.857 --> 01:33:04.258
All right.

01:33:05.026 --> 01:33:07.424
What do we have here?

01:33:08.279 --> 01:33:10.558
You got me, Officer!

01:33:11.658 --> 01:33:12.976
I did it!

01:33:13.076 --> 01:33:15.735
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.

01:33:17.288 --> 01:33:18.607
And I'm...

01:33:19.207 --> 01:33:20.525
sorry.

01:33:25.421 --> 01:33:27.119
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

01:33:27.257 --> 01:33:30.781
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?

01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:32.832
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.

01:33:33.805 --> 01:33:37.413
- I'd go with the pepper spray.
- Yes, I heard him, all right.

01:33:38.643 --> 01:33:41.124
He said he was sorry.

01:33:42.230 --> 01:33:45.885
Besides, it looks like everything
is all here and accounted for.

01:33:46.276 --> 01:33:48.092
Help me out here, people.

01:33:48.778 --> 01:33:49.763
Martha?

01:33:49.863 --> 01:33:52.225
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!

01:33:53.825 --> 01:33:57.148
I'm afraid I do have something for you!

01:34:08.173 --> 01:34:09.657
Your ring back.

01:34:10.258 --> 01:34:11.327
Sorry...

01:34:11.718 --> 01:34:13.950
but my heart belongs to...

01:34:14.637 --> 01:34:16.122
someone else.

01:34:32.238 --> 01:34:34.185
No hard feelings?

01:34:41.456 --> 01:34:42.857
Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas.

01:34:57.722 --> 01:34:59.835
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

01:35:04.771 --> 01:35:06.006
Your cheek is so...

01:35:06.564 --> 01:35:07.669
I know.

01:35:08.775 --> 01:35:09.796
Hairy?

01:35:10.527 --> 01:35:12.390
- No.
- Greasy?

01:35:13.321 --> 01:35:15.268
Stinky? Do I have a zit?

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:16.845
No.

01:35:18.493 --> 01:35:20.060
Warm.

01:35:26.751 --> 01:35:31.823
<i>Fah who foraze, dah who doraze</i>

01:35:31.923 --> 01:35:36.703
<i>Welcome, Christmas, come this way</i>

01:35:36.803 --> 01:35:41.666
<i>Fah who foraze, dah who doraze</i>

01:35:41.766 --> 01:35:46.796
<i>Welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day</i>

01:35:46.896 --> 01:35:51.718
<i>Welcome, welcome, fah who Ramus</i>

01:35:51.818 --> 01:35:56.623
<i>Welcome, welcome, dah who Damus</i>

01:35:56.723 --> 01:36:01.478
<i>Christmas Day is in our grasp</i>

01:36:01.578 --> 01:36:06.566
<i>So long as we have hands to clasp</i>

01:36:06.666 --> 01:36:11.613
<i>Fah who ray-moo ya-who hee haw</i>

01:36:11.713 --> 01:36:16.618
<i>Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer</i>

01:36:16.718 --> 01:36:19.162
<i>Fah who foraze</i>

01:36:19.262 --> 01:36:24.167
<i>Dah who doraze, welcome all Whos</i>

01:36:24.267 --> 01:36:25.926
<i>Far</i>

01:36:26.769 --> 01:36:28.380
<i>And</i>

01:36:29.814 --> 01:36:31.806
<i>Near</i>

01:36:33.693 --> 01:36:37.182
So he brought back the toys
and the food for the feast.

01:36:37.405 --> 01:36:40.147
And he, he himself, the Grinch...

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:42.517
carved the roast beast.

01:36:42.702 --> 01:36:44.020
Yeah!

01:36:58.718 --> 01:37:00.333
There's nothin' like the holidays.

01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:02.867
- Who wants the gizzard?
- I do!

01:37:02.972 --> 01:37:03.994
Too late!

01:37:04.098 --> 01:37:05.458
That'll be mine.

01:37:05.558 --> 01:37:09.380
<i>Where are you, Christmas?</i>

01:37:09.771 --> 01:37:13.924
<i>I think I've found you</i>

01:37:14.025 --> 01:37:19.092
<i>This time I'll make you stay</i>

01:37:20.114 --> 01:37:23.888
<i>All will be singing</i>

01:37:24.035 --> 01:37:27.857
<i>Bells will be ringing</i>

01:37:28.122 --> 01:37:31.695
<i>Now and forever</i>

01:37:31.876 --> 01:37:36.861
<i>Christmas Day</i>

01:38:01.651 --> 01:38:05.930
<i>Where are you, Christmas</i>

01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:09.885
<i>Why can't I find you</i>

01:38:10.268 --> 01:38:15.875
<i>Why have you gone away</i>

01:38:18.876 --> 01:38:23.281
<i>Where is the laughter</i>

01:38:23.381 --> 01:38:27.619
<i>You used to bring me</i>

01:38:27.719 --> 01:38:33.567
<i>Why can't I hear music play</i>

01:38:36.561 --> 01:38:40.924
<i>My world is changing</i>

01:38:41.024 --> 01:38:45.220
<i>I'm rearranging</i>

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.973
<i>Does that mean Christmas</i>

01:38:49.073 --> 01:38:55.581
<i>Changes too</i>

01:39:02.612 --> 01:39:06.950
<i>Where are you, Christmas</i>

01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:11.351
<i>Do you remember</i>

01:39:11.471 --> 01:39:17.649
<i>The one you used to know</i>

01:39:20.271 --> 01:39:24.384
<i>I'm not the same one</i>

01:39:24.484 --> 01:39:28.910
<i>See what the time's done</i>

01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:32.517
<i>Is that why you have</i>

01:39:32.617 --> 01:39:39.125
<i>Let me go</i>

01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:45.238
<i>Christmas is here</i>

01:39:45.338 --> 01:39:47.932
<i>Everywhere</i>

01:39:50.718 --> 01:39:53.955
<i>Christmas is here</i>

01:39:54.055 --> 01:39:57.730
<i>If you care</i>

01:39:59.977 --> 01:40:02.714
<i>If there is love</i>

01:40:02.814 --> 01:40:07.615
<i>In your heart and your mind</i>

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:14.243
<i>You will feel like Christmas
all the time</i>

01:40:16.994 --> 01:40:21.232
<i>I feel you, Christmas</i>

01:40:21.332 --> 01:40:25.611
<i>I know I've found you</i>

01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:32.060
<i>You never fade away</i>

01:40:34.512 --> 01:40:38.791
<i>The joy of Christmas</i>

01:40:38.891 --> 01:40:43.254
<i>Stays here in silence</i>

01:40:43.354 --> 01:40:48.406
<i>Fills each and every heart</i>

01:40:50.528 --> 01:40:53.830
<i>With love</i>

01:41:08.129 --> 01:41:10.239
<i>They're makin' noise</i>

01:41:10.339 --> 01:41:13.058
<i>Noise, noise, noise</i>

01:41:14.844 --> 01:41:17.893
<i>How I hate their happy noise</i>

01:41:19.891 --> 01:41:22.594
<i>There's only one thing I hate more</i>

01:41:22.694 --> 01:41:25.254
<i>Come to think of it</i>

01:41:25.354 --> 01:41:28.466
<i>And that's the people who keep</i>

01:41:28.566 --> 01:41:30.113
<i>Makin' it</i>

01:41:30.568 --> 01:41:33.697
<i>Feast, feast, feast, feast</i>

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:39.873
<i>They'll have more
than anyone could ever eat</i>

01:41:40.953 --> 01:41:43.314
<i>Me, I'm stuck here with my</i>

01:41:43.414 --> 01:41:45.667
<i>Cream of wheat</i>

01:41:46.209 --> 01:41:49.353
<i>There's no one here to feast with me</i>

01:41:51.422 --> 01:41:54.967
<i>On this lonely Christmas Eve</i>

01:41:56.702 --> 01:42:00.102
<i>Don't they know I'm up here all alone</i>

01:42:01.974 --> 01:42:05.073
<i>In my cave up in the hills</i>

01:42:07.188 --> 01:42:10.716
<i>How I wish that this would go away</i>

01:42:10.816 --> 01:42:13.302
<i>This dreadful holiday</i>

01:42:13.402 --> 01:42:16.952
<i>That they call Christmas Day</i>

01:42:20.368 --> 01:42:26.125
<i>It's a lonely Christmas Eve</i>

01:42:35.199 --> 01:42:38.678
<i>The streets are filled
with Christmas cheer</i>

01:42:39.262 --> 01:42:42.812
<i>At least it's only once a year</i>

01:42:43.432 --> 01:42:47.211
<i>Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows</i>

01:42:47.311 --> 01:42:50.815
<i>And carols ringing in my ear</i>

01:42:51.315 --> 01:42:54.694
<i>Bundled up against the cold</i>

01:42:55.236 --> 01:42:58.661
<i>Lines wherever gifts are sold</i>

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:03.027
<i>Each shop window
displays a Christmas scene</i>

01:43:03.127 --> 01:43:06.922
<i>For everybody young and old</i>

01:43:07.373 --> 01:43:10.593
<i>Icicles on eaves troughs
and tinsel on the tree</i>

01:43:10.693 --> 01:43:14.263
<i>But it's a green Christmas for me</i>

01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:20.762
<i>Couples skating on the pond</i>

01:43:21.304 --> 01:43:24.808
<i>Makin' angels on the lawn</i>

01:43:25.266 --> 01:43:29.086
<i>Five red mittens drying on the rack</i>

01:43:29.186 --> 01:43:33.191
<i>And needle-shedding Tannenbaum</i>

01:43:33.316 --> 01:43:36.619
<i>Red bows on the railings
and snowflakes on the ground</i>

01:43:36.719 --> 01:43:40.995
<i>But it's a green Christmas in this town</i>

01:43:43.242 --> 01:43:44.810
<i>Green</i>

01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:48.731
<i>'Cause of everything I miss</i>

01:43:48.831 --> 01:43:52.051
<i>All this mistletoe, no kiss</i>

01:43:52.835 --> 01:43:55.884
<i>And with every Christmas wish</i>

01:43:56.756 --> 01:44:00.618
<i>There would be no greater gift</i>

01:44:00.718 --> 01:44:03.892
<i>Than to have this envy lift</i>

01:44:15.399 --> 01:44:19.136
<i>Carolers are at my door</i>

01:44:19.236 --> 01:44:23.116
<i>Don't wanna hear them anymore</i>

01:44:23.282 --> 01:44:26.669
<i>Stockings on the mantel
The snow's here every day</i>

01:44:26.769 --> 01:44:30.840
<i>But it's a green Christmas anyway</i>

01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:34.652
<i>Red nose on the reindeer
Tinsel on the tree</i>

01:44:34.752 --> 01:44:38.805
<i>But it's a green Christmas for me</i>

01:44:39.305 --> 01:44:45.251
