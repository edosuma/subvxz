WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.617
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.712 --> 00:04.122
Crichton:
Radiation.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.295
Massive radiation.

00:06.382 --> 00:08.338
I've never felt better.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.667
Crais:
The, uh, other Crichton.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.012
He's dead.

00:12.096 --> 00:16.465
Aeryn:
| just can't watch that
happen again.

00:16.559 --> 00:19.767
We were so perfect, and
you're just like him.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.219
I mean, you are him.

00:21.314 --> 00:23.270
No, I'm me.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.190
Scorpius:
You give me what I want,
or I swear,

00:26.277 --> 00:31.988
|wi|| keep you alive so that
you can witness your
homeworld's destruction!

00:32.074 --> 00:34.156
| suggest you hang on
to something.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.779
Talyn.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.360
Starburst.

00:40.458 --> 00:43.825
This ship is dead!

00:43.920 --> 00:46.081
The wormhole experiment is over.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.496
Aeryn.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.419
Fly safe.

00:52.637 --> 00:55.424
We all knew the time would come
when we'd split up.

00:57.433 --> 01:01.142
In the beginning I would never
have even believed it could
take so long.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.140
Rygel:
Don't think I'm going
to miss you.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.314
Any of you. I'm not.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.107
Well, maybe a little bit.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.239
And now, on Farscape.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.794
Oh.

01:28.339 --> 01:29.499
(sighs)

01:33.052 --> 01:35.134
It doesn't work.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.342
Oh, yes it does.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.174
Just not for the wedding.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.225
Hey!
(giggles )

01:49.902 --> 01:51.312
John?

02:07.378 --> 02:13.089
You wear this and somebody's
gonna marry you.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.303
Come on, Crichton.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.005
I've been to a few
different places.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.217
Your world can't be that
hard to adjust to.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.223
You still have to ask her.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.396
Doesn't work that way.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.269
(clanking)

02:31.360 --> 02:33.851
Might I interject?

02:33.946 --> 02:36.653
Would you like some yirgra
fungal chowder?

02:39.285 --> 02:41.150
Oh, well.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.987
Perhaps Aeryn wouldn't have
liked your planet anyway.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.163
Crichton:
Okay, big moment.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.365
You're up.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.997
Uh-uh...
-Come on.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.044
Sarge it.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.667
Ch...

02:58.763 --> 03:00.594
Again. Ch...

03:00.681 --> 03:02.342
Sarch it.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.049
Where's she from?

03:05.144 --> 03:07.055
Like Bosnia?

03:09.231 --> 03:10.141
Charge it.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.017
Oh.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.097
Thank you.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.309
I told you.
-No, look, that was good.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.188
She almost understood
what you said.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.689
That was completely
embarrassing.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.022
Baby, look, English is a
very difficult language.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.232
Half the time people don't
understand what I'm
talking about.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.817
You're doing great.
-No, I'm not.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.322
Nobody here understands
what I'm saying.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.496
This whole frelling planet
needs translator microbes.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.498
Chiana:
Hey old woman, why didn't you
leave with the others?

03:32.588 --> 03:34.954
Because I knew the souffle
would charm you.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.381
Chowder, you said it
was chowder.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.801
I can make you a chowder.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.756
Pip, who is that woman?

03:45.851 --> 03:48.558
I thought she was with you.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.386
Look at this.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.188
Pilot, I'm seeing
another Leviathan.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.517
Pilot:
We have arrived at the
Leviathan Burial Place.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.444
D'Argo, how much
are you taking?

04:02.535 --> 04:05.242
Macton's posting is a long
way away. Thanks.

04:05.329 --> 04:08.241
You could resupply during
the journey.

04:08.332 --> 04:12.996
Well revenge is a feast best
served immediately.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.793
You're going to get
yourself killed.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.086
We all are.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.210
At least we'll do it on our
home planets.

04:19.301 --> 04:22.338
I'm surprised that Crais
sacrificed himself.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.261
Talyn was such a fine ship.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.385
I can't believe this is all
that's left of him.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.726
So what are you gonna do
after we bury Talyn?

04:34.817 --> 04:38.355
Same thing I'm doing now.
Working on wormhole theory.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.524
(yells)

04:42.074 --> 04:43.405
Vision?

04:45.202 --> 04:47.238
D-d-darkness.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.741
M-M-Moya...

04:49.832 --> 04:51.447
...swallowed.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.123
Pilot, is everything okay?

04:53.210 --> 04:54.825
No, Commander.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.581
Brace for collision, everybody!

04:56.672 --> 04:59.129
Brace for collision!
-Pilot!

04:59.216 --> 05:02.674
Oh, praise the spirits!
I'm never gonna finish
this recipe.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.750
( screams )

05:05.055 --> 05:06.340
( screams )

05:09.435 --> 05:10.265
Oh!

05:15.149 --> 05:17.515
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

05:17.610 --> 05:21.353
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

05:21.447 --> 05:23.028
I'm trying to stay alive...

05:23.115 --> 05:25.026
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

05:25.117 --> 05:27.824
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.368
If you can hear me...
Beware.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.446
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

05:31.540 --> 05:34.247
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

05:34.335 --> 05:38.795
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

05:38.881 --> 05:41.213
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

05:41.300 --> 05:43.757
Not show them...
You exist...

05:43.844 --> 05:47.553
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.838
Total crap. Completely dead.
Pilot, how long?

06:22.925 --> 06:26.964
Soon. Moya is rallying
herself to recovery.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.136
That lunatic Leviathan's
still out there?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.509
Rygel:
Hasn't moved.
Just staring us down.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.977
Central pumping mechanism
is a total loss.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.301
Tier Three is underwater.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.602
Conduit bulkhead breach.

06:36.689 --> 06:39.396
Janz-two torpedo could not
have done it better.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.439
That crazy tralk really knew
where to hit us, didn't she?

06:41.527 --> 06:45.941
Moya's nerval crytex is
impossible to target so
successfully,

06:46.031 --> 06:48.113
unless by another Leviathan.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.577
Rygel:
Pilot, what the yotz
brought this on?

06:50.661 --> 06:53.243
I still haven't made contact
with the other Pilot.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.914
However, it appears to have
something to do with Talyn.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.707
Rygel:
Oh, Talyn again?

06:58.794 --> 07:01.251
I told you we should have
dumped his debris.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.794
We wouldn't even be here.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.258
Without Talyn you wouldn't be
here. So show some respect.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.799
Rygel:
Respect! My tiny, shiny heinie.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.093
It's gonna get us killed.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.796
And who the frell is this?

07:14.310 --> 07:17.393
One, two, three.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.140
( screaming )

07:19.231 --> 07:21.893
(laughing)

07:21.984 --> 07:26.318
And reroute Moya's systems to
help in the recovery process.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.396
Does everyone know what to do?

07:28.699 --> 07:29.905
Yeah.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.320
Crichton?

07:34.204 --> 07:37.412
(cheering and applause)

07:45.424 --> 07:46.755
Huh?

07:47.843 --> 07:49.504
Rygel:
Pay attention!

07:49.595 --> 07:51.551
This is serious.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.761
Yeah, it's a good plan.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.148
Thank you.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.820
Thank you very much. Thank you.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.944
That's my cousin Susan.
-Aeryn, John.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.822
Congratulations.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.159
John.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.741
Tonight you are the second
luckiest man on Earth.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.121
Know what I mean?

08:24.213 --> 08:25.874
(laughing)

08:25.964 --> 08:28.876
Though still groggy,
Moya informs me

08:28.967 --> 08:32.300
that each of this Leviathan's
last three offspring

08:32.388 --> 08:35.880
were captured and enslaved
by Peacekeeper hunters.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.216
And she won't let Talyn be
buried in the Sacred Space
because he's half Peacekeeper.

08:39.311 --> 08:44.556
This ship is quite irrational
and as we've seen, prepared
to enforce her edict.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.436
Can't you work this out
with the other Pilot?

08:46.527 --> 08:50.315
He has yet to return my
communication, but I'm trying.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.362
Mmm, that's certainly true.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.110
Oh. Ahh!

08:54.201 --> 08:55.361
Pay attention.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.704
(thud )
Oh! Fahrbot!

08:57.788 --> 09:03.078
When we get out of this, are
you still gonna look for
that eX-Peacekeeper unit?

09:03.168 --> 09:05.659
Can you keep the light on
where I'm working?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.369
Sorry.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.254
They assassinate people, right?

09:10.342 --> 09:13.675
The squad aims to stop
terrorism and protect people.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.378
Didn't you learn anything on
the Command Carrier?

09:17.558 --> 09:20.174
Want some advice?

09:20.269 --> 09:23.102
Look Jool, I'm not
Crichton's mate.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.224
I'm not tied to him in any way.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.313
In the short time I've known
you, you've changed so much.

09:31.447 --> 09:33.688
Don't go backwards.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.282
Assassinating people...

09:37.369 --> 09:39.655
seems like going backwards.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.701
Can you melt that?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.907
With what?
There's no power yet.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.708
( piercing scream )

09:48.547 --> 09:50.583
Ow...
-Thank you.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.169
Chiana:
Hey.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.803
Hamman side's tight.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.721
Looks like Moya's
gonna be okay.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.264
Yeah.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.845
Hey, you know... you know what
I said before about...

10:06.940 --> 10:09.556
about not wanting you
to come with me?

10:10.360 --> 10:13.102
That wasn't exactly right.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.687
Pip, it's cool.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.568
Where you been?

10:20.662 --> 10:23.404
Not now. This is not right.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.622
I would love you to
come with me.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.170
But you know, I...

10:36.261 --> 10:39.094
I gotta find my brother and
he's in this resistance
thing, and...

10:39.181 --> 10:44.551
and as if I'm gonna find him
hanging out with someone
who looks like...

10:44.645 --> 10:47.227
A Peacekeeper?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.312
It's cool.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.857
What are we gonna do if this
crazy tralk doesn't let Moya
into the burial grounds?

10:55.948 --> 10:59.156
Perhaps I could offer the
benefit of my training.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.780
What, how? As a chef?

11:01.870 --> 11:04.577
And doctor. Instructor.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.874
And among many other
disciplines, negotiator.

11:08.961 --> 11:11.577
Listen Wrinkles, how about you
just stick to the chowder.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.964
You can deal with the
old frelnik.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.009
(yells)

11:28.272 --> 11:30.137
Damn!

11:30.232 --> 11:32.348
I can't see!

11:32.442 --> 11:34.148
God! Ah!

11:41.118 --> 11:43.154
Go to the truth.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.618
Ignore it

11:52.713 --> 11:54.578
and risk all.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.441
( gunshots )

12:16.194 --> 12:17.274
No!

12:17.362 --> 12:19.398
Get down! Get down!

12:26.204 --> 12:27.819
D'Argo:
John.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.296
Ah... ah, nothing. Nothing.
He'll be fine.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.247
What did you do?

12:39.343 --> 12:41.425
Perhaps a slight misjudgment
of his weight.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.251
It won't occur again,
I'm certain.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.211
So am I.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.796
(grunts)

12:45.891 --> 12:49.349
Pilot:
Aeryn, D'Argo, the Leviathan
killed her own Pilot.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.676
Nutrient starvation.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.762
Why would she do that?
-l'm not sure,

12:52.856 --> 12:54.562
but she threatens to
attack again

12:54.650 --> 12:58.142
if Moya does not take Talyn's
remains and vacate the area.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.979
Never one to say I told you so,
but shall we go?

13:02.074 --> 13:04.360
Well, I can't believe I'm
agreeing with Rygel,

13:04.451 --> 13:07.284
but under the circumstances,
with Moya injured...

13:07.371 --> 13:12.536
Moya feels Talyn has earned the
right to be buried in the
Sacred Space,

13:12.626 --> 13:15.709
and she will not yield.

13:18.507 --> 13:22.876
Don't you ever get bored,
living on the same planet,
never going anywhere?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.460
And what about living
in a house?

13:24.554 --> 13:27.341
It's too quiet, there's
no engine noise.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.801
Well wait till summer, when the
air conditioning kicks on.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.512
John has this fantasy about us

13:35.607 --> 13:40.601
having kids and dogs and
the pool and barbecues.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.652
Jack:
Must seem a strange culture.

13:42.739 --> 13:47.278
Jack, lam miserable here,
and he just doesn't see it.

13:47.369 --> 13:52.409
I'm going to get married,
end up like Betty Crocker.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.535
I just keep wondering when
he's gonna wake up.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.003
I'm awake.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.418
You all right?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.915
Well...

14:00.007 --> 14:02.999
between the witch
and the Luxan...

14:07.264 --> 14:08.720
Still?

14:08.807 --> 14:12.299
The other Leviathan killed
her own pilot, and Moya
won't back down.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.975
Uh... Can Moya beat her?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.848
Damage is too great.

14:15.939 --> 14:18.100
We could dodge for a while,
but eventually...

14:18.191 --> 14:19.692
(clanging)

14:19.776 --> 14:21.312
We have to cut and run.

14:21.403 --> 14:25.021
Pilot can't convince her and,
uh, Chiana and Rygel are trying.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.150
Sparky and Pip?

14:26.241 --> 14:27.856
Oh!
(clanging)

14:27.951 --> 14:31.318
If you untie me, I shall
volunteer again to mediate,

14:31.413 --> 14:34.200
even... even though I...
I know that, um...

14:34.291 --> 14:36.873
Who is that woman?
-I don't know.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.297
Listen, Moya,

14:48.805 --> 14:51.012
uh...

14:52.976 --> 14:55.217
everyone is, uh...

14:55.312 --> 14:59.225
is really concerned,
about your plan.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.149
I... I mean, even Aeryn
thinks that...

15:03.236 --> 15:06.319
that maybe Talyn should be laid
to rest someplace else.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.358
lonce, um...

15:11.453 --> 15:13.694
I once asked Zhaan...

15:13.789 --> 15:16.280
I once asked Zhaan...

15:16.374 --> 15:20.287
how... how she got along
with you so well.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.870
She... she said that the...
that the key...

15:23.965 --> 15:25.796
that the key was to be honest.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.499
Was to be honest.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.424
No matter what.

15:28.512 --> 15:31.720
( chuckles ):
No matter what.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.263
Well, Moya...

15:43.568 --> 15:46.184
this... this is what I think.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.771
I think that you should bury
Talyn wherever you frelling
wanna bury Talyn!

15:49.866 --> 15:52.778
And I think that... that the
frelling tralk should...

15:52.869 --> 15:55.952
should get out of our
frelling way.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.833
There.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.999
That's what I think.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.378
Hey, Crichton. Where ya been?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.671
What is all this?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.714
I went shopping.
(giggles )

16:08.802 --> 16:10.338
Shopping?

16:10.428 --> 16:13.044
Does this color go with my eyes?
-No, no, you don't have
any money.

16:15.767 --> 16:18.053
Lifting. Shoplifting.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.353
But look. Look at these cool
presents I brought the
bridesmaids.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.724
You and Aeryn can give
them to 'em.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.101
( barking )

16:24.192 --> 16:25.693
Sit down.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.525
Aww...

16:27.612 --> 16:29.864
Hey, I spent some time
with the boys.

16:29.948 --> 16:33.065
Think I found who the
best man is.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.400
W-w-why are you doing this?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.486
Why can't you just act like
you always have, fit in?

16:37.581 --> 16:40.072
Why... why do you have to sleep
with all of my friends?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.249
Oh, this is such a
repressed culture!

16:42.335 --> 16:44.121
Back.

16:44.212 --> 16:45.122
Son.

16:45.213 --> 16:45.998
Dad.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.330
Dad! Hi!

16:52.053 --> 16:53.304
Dad?

16:55.015 --> 16:59.054
Son, your mother has been
gone for so long.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.394
This is not right.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.397
That's not right.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.941
D'Argo:
I do not agree, John.
I think she has a point.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.396
Ya see?
-D'Argo, you don't even know
how to fly your ship.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.276
I do, in theory.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.325
And it certainly has enough
firepower to destroy
a Leviathan.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.572
It's just not right.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.244
Why does it always have
to be your plan?

17:20.332 --> 17:21.412
It doesn't.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.909
But I don't think that Moya

17:23.001 --> 17:24.662
is going to let us kill one
of her own species.

17:24.753 --> 17:27.119
Pilot:
I have some information.

17:29.500 --> 17:29.591
And it's worse than we thought.

17:29.591 --> 17:33.834
Apparently, Moya is not the
first to be attacked by
this rogue Leviathan. -Go on. Fly away. Go on.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.545
Three others are already dead.
-Go on, shoo! Shoo, shoo!

17:36.640 --> 17:38.722
Still more grievously injured.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.548
Hang on!

17:41.645 --> 17:43.181
( screams )

17:49.194 --> 17:53.733
Pilot:
Apologies. Moya is now
responding defensively on her own.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.984
Moya understands the grief
of losing a child.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.367
However, this female's behavior
is unacceptable.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.199
She asks for your help.
-Yes.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.249
She has our backing
no matter what.

18:07.337 --> 18:11.330
Moya knows, which is why she
feels comfortable making
this request.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.503
Kill the rogue Leviathan.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.175
Yes.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.259
All right, old girl.
( chuckles )

18:23.353 --> 18:24.342
Not you.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.177
I'll prime my ship.
-Kill?

18:26.273 --> 18:29.060
( screams )

18:29.150 --> 18:30.230
Yes, Commander.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.309
Before she kills us.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.069
So you'll be there?

18:35.156 --> 18:38.239
Yeah, but Chiana can handle it.
-Just be there.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.157
(rumbling)

18:40.245 --> 18:42.031
Chiana midwifed Talyn's birth.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.908
She shouldn't have to
bury him alone.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.159
Aeryn:
I don't make errors.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.490
D'Argo:
The Leviathan can't
be stationary,

18:46.584 --> 18:48.199
but be sure it's not
moving too fast.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.377
I know.
-It's not too far but it's
not too close either.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.250
Do you want me to shoot the
frelling thing myself?
( growls )

18:53.341 --> 18:59.211
Even though it's a disturbed
creature, you're still about
to take a life.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.260
Are you going to be
okay with that?

19:08.898 --> 19:10.889
Be careful.
-I don't have to fly
with D'Argo.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.599
I heard that.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.234
Now do you remember everything
I told you about flying
the ship?

19:22.329 --> 19:23.865
Almost nothing.

19:23.955 --> 19:24.944
Excellent.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.325
Pilot, we are in position.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.203
Moya, it's time Talyn
was laid to rest.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.535
In the Sacred Place.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.920
(grunts)

19:37.177 --> 19:38.292
Whew...

19:40.180 --> 19:41.886
Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.259
Rygel:
We're in. We're in.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.434
What the yotz is so sacred
about this?

19:50.190 --> 19:53.057
All right, we've got that
rogue's attention.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.482
She's now following us.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.230
Yes, | see her, Rygel.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.619
D'Argo:
Look, keep it steady.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.194
If I don't get accurate
resonant capture, then
we're all done for.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.826
I thought you said this thing
only responds to your DNA.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.374
It does, that's why I covered
all the controls...

20:11.461 --> 20:13.873
Ooh. That's why I'm
wearing gloves.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.169
Aeryn:
D'Argo, Crichton.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.292
This Leviathan is a lot
larger than Moya.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.999
The best I'll be able to do
is annoy her.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.379
D'Argo:
That's all right.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.755
Just keep her within range.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.964
We'll give the slijnot
something to focus on.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.301
Aeryn:
As soon as | see Talyn's
remains, I shall commence a firing run.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.603
I'm just waiting on a
go ahead from D'Argo.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.429
Crichton:
I understand, it's difficult.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.810
D'Argo:
It's not difficult.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.482
Yes, it is.
Everybody thinks you're freak.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.231
Everyone thinks I'm a freak.
Hey boys, how are they biting?

20:39.322 --> 20:41.233
Terrible, Mr. D'Argo.
-Can you help again?

20:41.324 --> 20:44.031
See, they don't think
I'm a freak.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.074
What the hell are you doing?

20:45.161 --> 20:46.116
What do you think I'm doing?

20:46.204 --> 20:48.160
I'm not entirely sure,
but don't kill Aeryn.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.364
I'm not gonna kill anyone!
Why are you so disagreeable?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.949
I'm not disagreeable.
I got things on my mind.
-You are being disagreeable.

20:53.044 --> 20:56.161
I am sorry that Aeryn is
leaving you but don't
take it out on me.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.245
I heard she left you
at the altar.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.329
Shut up.
-Hey!

20:58.425 --> 21:00.131
It's not just Aeryn.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.958
You're all leaving.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.465
Whenever you thought you'd
found a wormhole, you fell over
yourself to dive in.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.342
Don't begrudge us our dreams.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.923
Idont

21:08.017 --> 21:11.054
It's just a hell of a dream you
got there, D, killing a man.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.604
I don't want to kill him,
I just want revenge.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.227
What do you think you're doing?

21:16.317 --> 21:19.024
Don't horde the silver, John.
I think you should head
straight for Earth.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.977
No, that's not an option.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.312
The Peacekeepers would follow.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.318
You know, I should never
have come here.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.616
I should never have come to
Earth. I should have left you
guys on Moya.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.160
If it's such a simple choice,
why are you agonising over it?

21:29.247 --> 21:30.362
Because I'm an idiot.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.448
Yeah, you are an idiot.
I'm an idiot, we're all idiots,

21:32.542 --> 21:33.998
Aren't we, boys?
-Yeah.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.120
Everyone's an idiot.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.202
(alarm beeping )
Speaking of idiots...

21:37.297 --> 21:39.128
That cannot be right.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.256
( beeping stops)

21:42.343 --> 21:43.378
Ha.

21:44.554 --> 21:45.543
Yeah!

21:45.638 --> 21:48.345
D'Argo:
One shot.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.923
And you said I'd never
fit in here.

21:50.018 --> 21:50.928
I never said that.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.099
Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

21:52.187 --> 21:53.267
I remember, you did.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.231
He's armed and he's dangerous!

21:59.319 --> 22:00.399
( spitting )

22:07.285 --> 22:09.321
Talyn.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.283
He, uh...

22:17.962 --> 22:19.827
he was our protector.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.298
Ourfamily.

22:24.385 --> 22:27.092
Rygel:
Ah, may I say a few words?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.169
Yeah.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.801
He was a lost soul...
( Rygel clears throat)

22:30.892 --> 22:32.348
searching for...

22:32.435 --> 22:34.050
Talyn was special.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.888
Ajoy to his mother and a
credit to his species.
Both of them.

22:37.982 --> 22:43.648
With fondness, we lay Talyn,
offspring of Moya, to rest
in his sacred ground.

22:50.245 --> 22:52.327
Crichton:
The rogue is making a
run at the debris.

22:52.413 --> 22:56.031
Pilot:
Moya pleads with you not to let
her disperse Talyn's remains.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.207
Commencing attack.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.542
Crichton:
Here she comes, D'Argo.
Right where you want her.

23:06.636 --> 23:10.754
Rygel:
Good job, Aeryn. She's veering
away from Talyn and chasing you.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.384
All right, let's do it.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.462
Very effective.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.798
Did you get her?

23:54.892 --> 23:57.144
Aeryn:
She's gone.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.889
Completely.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.595
Chi.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.022
They got her.

24:04.319 --> 24:07.482
You know what this means?

24:07.572 --> 24:09.358
It means we're done.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.360
Talyn rests where he belongs.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.737
Scorpius has no ship.

24:13.828 --> 24:19.619
We're all unhurt, healthy and
no one's trying to kill us.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.040
( laughs )

24:21.127 --> 24:25.120
It means finally, we can
go where we want.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.624
We can go home.

24:26.716 --> 24:30.300
(laughing ):
Home.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.423
We're going home.
I'm going home.

24:34.724 --> 24:37.215
(laughing)

24:55.912 --> 24:58.073
Who are you, old woman?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.663
It doesn't matter who I am.

25:03.044 --> 25:05.000
But I know who you are.

25:07.131 --> 25:12.546
You made them come back and
rescue our lifepod after the
Command Carrier imploded.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.299
I'm no longer a prisoner
because of you.

25:17.350 --> 25:21.013
So when the others got off,

25:21.104 --> 25:24.016
I stayed on Moya to
repay the debt.

25:24.107 --> 25:25.813
By messing with my mind.

25:25.900 --> 25:29.108
Oh, no. No, I would never...

25:29.195 --> 25:30.856
leave this on boil for so long.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.983
Would you like some before it...
-What did you do to me?!

25:34.158 --> 25:36.274
We all lie.

25:36.369 --> 25:42.410
The lies that spew outward do
much less damage that the ones
that stay hidden.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.705
(gunshot)

26:08.025 --> 26:10.892
When I was a kid,

26:10.987 --> 26:14.525
I dreamed of outer space.

26:17.326 --> 26:20.284
And then I got here,

26:20.371 --> 26:22.748
and I dream of Earth.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.621
Lately, none of my dreams work.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.958
Do you know why?

26:32.341 --> 26:34.297
Trying to make it the
way it was,

26:34.385 --> 26:37.001
the way it... never was.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.348
Did my herbs help you?

26:42.435 --> 26:44.676
They stripped away the lies.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.221
But I ran from it.

26:50.109 --> 26:55.103
And I am so tired of running.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.372
Show me again.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.891
(whispering ):
Forward is the truth.

27:34.111 --> 27:38.480
It's the lies that restrain us.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.282
(waltz playing )

28:37.967 --> 28:39.377
You will know.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.254
May I cut in, son?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.478
(clanking glasses)

29:00.573 --> 29:02.905
( cheering )

29:18.925 --> 29:21.257
Everybody...

29:21.344 --> 29:27.635
Everybody, I want to propose
a toast to my son, and
my new daughter.

29:27.725 --> 29:30.717
You all know their incredible
story, the odds they
had to beat,

29:30.811 --> 29:34.269
the good fortune that brought
'em home, safe and sound.

29:34.357 --> 29:42.321
So please join me in wishing
the new Mr. and Mrs. Crichton
all the best...

29:42.406 --> 29:43.612
(gunshot)

29:51.540 --> 29:53.246
No. No. No.
-Get down!

29:53.334 --> 29:54.744
See truth!
-Everybody run!

29:54.835 --> 29:56.700
See truth.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.213
See truth. See it.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.465
Confront your fear.

30:31.706 --> 30:33.412
(gunshot)

30:43.926 --> 30:45.427
(gunshot)

30:58.733 --> 31:00.223
(gunshot)

31:18.377 --> 31:20.618
( gunshots )

31:45.279 --> 31:48.897
No. No. No, baby, no.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.816
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.324
Don't you worry about me.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.745
I've never felt better.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.795
No!

32:08.886 --> 32:11.172
(whimpering):
No, no!

32:11.263 --> 32:12.844
No.

32:30.074 --> 32:32.156
Well, then, John.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.900
Tell me.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.372
What did you expect?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.884
It's a nightmare.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.428
What is?

33:05.192 --> 33:08.901
My life. My dreams.

33:10.406 --> 33:13.443
Earth and my friends. I...

33:13.534 --> 33:16.241
I tried to merge the two.

33:16.954 --> 33:18.819
They're incompatible.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.244
Then choose one.

33:25.880 --> 33:30.169
I... can't go to Earth.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.671
And my friends are all leaving.

33:35.389 --> 33:37.425
You blame yourself.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.265
Dog with two bones.

33:41.562 --> 33:43.177
Unfamiliar.

33:43.272 --> 33:44.227
Dog.

33:44.315 --> 33:46.601
Animal. It's a pet.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.809
He has this bone. It's the most
important thing in the world.

33:49.904 --> 33:52.896
He carries it everywhere
he goes, and, uh...

33:52.990 --> 33:57.279
one day he goes down to the
water, and he sees another
dog with a bone,

33:57.369 --> 33:59.280
reflected on the surface.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.033
It's identical and he wants
that bone, too.

34:02.124 --> 34:06.709
So he opens his mouth
to grab it,

34:06.795 --> 34:11.084
and his bone falls in the water
and it disappears.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.166
It's gone.

34:16.430 --> 34:22.801
And he's left standing there
looking at himself.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.352
And he has nothing.

34:31.695 --> 34:35.108
Is this doag smart
enough to learn?

34:35.658 --> 34:37.023
Yeah, it's too late.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.494
It is never...

34:41.830 --> 34:46.950
If the doag could have
had only one bone,

34:47.044 --> 34:50.286
which would it have wanted?

34:58.180 --> 34:59.966
I'm coming with you.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.173
No. I'm sorry.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.180
Well, you're not leaving
without me.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.226
What do you want?

35:10.317 --> 35:11.727
You.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.734
I'm afraid it's not
that easy for me.

35:14.822 --> 35:17.154
You see, you died.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.108
I watched that happen,
and yet you're still alive.

35:20.202 --> 35:22.238
l have to go.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.249
Then say goodbye.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.994
We don't say goodbyes.

35:28.502 --> 35:29.912
We do this time.

35:30.004 --> 35:32.620
You see, you leave and then
you come back and l...

35:32.715 --> 35:36.754
I can't handle the in
between, Aeryn.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.884
Say goodbye.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.462
Fine. Goodbye, Crichton.

35:41.557 --> 35:44.640
John! My name is John.

35:44.727 --> 35:46.968
"Goodbye, John" to my face.

35:47.062 --> 35:50.179
Guarantee you won't die
in my arms again!

35:50.274 --> 35:52.230
Guarantee me you won't
die in mine.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.400
I can by leaving!

35:55.487 --> 35:57.603
Do you love John Crichton?

36:01.327 --> 36:02.863
Not him.

36:04.246 --> 36:05.782
Not me.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.160
John Crichton.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.546
Yes.

36:37.738 --> 36:40.275
Then what does that taste like?

36:42.284 --> 36:43.524
Yesterday.

36:43.619 --> 36:46.076
Huh.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.245
Well, nobody can compete
with that.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.208
I am so much better dead.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.160
I can't do this again.

36:55.255 --> 36:59.874
And I can't let the one thing
I love fly away in a
crappy little ship.

36:59.968 --> 37:03.756
You once said it was as if
the fates meant for us
to be together.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.257
And I believe that.

37:05.349 --> 37:07.260
Well then if it's true we
will be together again.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.933
Running away is not fate, Aeryn.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.351
Running away is running away.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.895
Fine, you want fate?
Here. I've got fate.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.188
Fate. Here.
-What?

37:15.275 --> 37:16.526
Coin toss.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.521
(sighs)

37:18.612 --> 37:21.399
What, like that side up,
you stay?

37:21.490 --> 37:23.401
Absolutely. Fate.

37:24.618 --> 37:27.405
Just make a frelling wormhole
and go home.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.953
There is no home.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.246
There is no wormhole.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.244
There's only y...

37:37.214 --> 37:38.545
Aeryn...

37:39.383 --> 37:41.749
anywhere in the universe,

37:41.844 --> 37:43.300
you pick the planet.

37:44.638 --> 37:45.923
It's too late for that.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.754
It's not too late.
-No, you're not listening to me.

37:47.850 --> 37:50.262
It's too late for me.

37:52.354 --> 37:56.438
You do this and we'll never
see each other again.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.814
Do you love Aeryn Sun?

38:10.456 --> 38:12.742
Beyond hope.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.665
Then don't make me say goodbye
and don't make me stay.

40:42.608 --> 40:48.194
D'Argo:
Anything positive I do with
the rest of my life will be because of you.

40:49.323 --> 40:51.279
Take care, my friend.

41:01.418 --> 41:04.831
Chiana:
You better not forget me.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.628
You better not ever forget
that I love you.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.678
Rygel:
Of all the lesser species,

41:18.769 --> 41:22.227
I admit I've grown to
like yours the best.

41:30.322 --> 41:33.155
Aeryn:
We're in the hands of fate now.

41:34.117 --> 41:36.403
We have to trust in that.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.572
Fly safe.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.250
Goodbye, John Crichton.

42:00.602 --> 42:04.311
Jool:
Crichton? Still alive?

42:04.398 --> 42:06.263
Out of fuel?

42:09.444 --> 42:10.399
Uh...

42:10.487 --> 42:14.526
Yeah, Jool, I'm...
almost out of fuel.

42:15.992 --> 42:19.484
Pilot, I'm heading back.

42:19.579 --> 42:24.243
Scorpius:
The human subconscious is
a fascinating place.

42:24.334 --> 42:26.575
Malleable. Permeable.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.748
Fallible.

42:30.132 --> 42:32.373
Harvey, you gotta get your
nose out of the dictionary.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.253
Guess what I found there, John?

42:34.344 --> 42:36.881
Go away. I don't feel like
talking right now.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.049
I will honor your wishes, John.

42:39.141 --> 42:43.680
However, having chosen our
partnership above all else,

42:43.770 --> 42:48.434
your wellbeing is now
irrevocably mine.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.771
My gift.

42:56.116 --> 42:58.072
Noranti:
Be forgiving.

42:59.286 --> 43:01.368
Be kind.

43:03.415 --> 43:05.781
Better angels.

43:06.376 --> 43:09.083
Her life.

43:09.629 --> 43:11.881
Her world.

43:13.133 --> 43:16.375
On her time...

43:16.470 --> 43:19.007
you will know...

43:20.307 --> 43:23.219
Aeryn is...

43:23.310 --> 43:25.722
with Child.

43:30.358 --> 43:34.772
Aeryn, why didn't ya tell me?

43:36.198 --> 43:37.404
Why didn't you trust me?

43:37.491 --> 43:39.777
Old woman!

43:39.868 --> 43:42.029
Pilot! Patch me through
to Aeryn.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.701
She is beyond our range,
Commander.

43:43.789 --> 43:45.120
Get a fix on her position.
We're going after her.

43:45.207 --> 43:46.447
Hold on a microt!

43:46.541 --> 43:47.371
Damn it, just do it!

43:47.459 --> 43:49.199
First, we'll go to my... aah!

43:49.294 --> 43:51.250
Obey his command, Pilot.

43:53.173 --> 43:55.630
Pilot, please.

43:55.717 --> 43:58.584
For the love of God, please.

44:00.472 --> 44:06.763
Uh, I shall approximate Officer
Sun's vector and initiate chase
upon your retrieval.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.481
Pilot:
Commander! Stay clear...

44:13.568 --> 44:15.104
We're... being... pulled in...

44:15.195 --> 44:18.437
(shouting through
radio static )

44:36.216 --> 44:39.424
You have got to be kidding me.
