WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:02.770
It was after hearing me

00:02.820 --> 00:05.689
that Tim Peake decided to
become an astronaut. - Really?

00:05.740 --> 00:08.090
Well, I can't be sure but why
else would he have done it?

00:08.140 --> 00:09.130
Meghan Markle?

00:09.180 --> 00:10.410
You know me from Suits?

00:10.460 --> 00:11.650
No, The Mail Online.

00:11.700 --> 00:16.410
What if the Magna Carta
was somehow... modified?

00:16.460 --> 00:19.360
It's not Britain in the 19th
century or the Isle of Wight now!

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.460 --> 00:41.850
Why do they make these carbon
monoxide alarms so small?

00:41.900 --> 00:43.210
Never mind all that.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.890
Nicola Sturgeon's about to
announce she's unilaterally

00:45.940 --> 00:48.170
pulling Scotland out of the union.

00:48.220 --> 00:52.050
And if we lose Scotland, I
won't be able to wear my kilts!

00:52.100 --> 00:54.530
Oh, do stop going on about your kilts!

00:54.580 --> 00:57.090
A whole new Magna Carta has emerged,

00:57.140 --> 01:00.330
a document that will bestow
upon us absolute power,

01:00.380 --> 01:04.290
the power of life and death, the
power to do whatever we want.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.530
And I've just sent my
red one to the cleaners.

01:06.580 --> 01:10.290
On top of all that, we've got to put
up with bloody Theresa May this weekend.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.370
Well, I don't like her
any more than you do,

01:12.420 --> 01:14.380
but her little visit is providing...

01:15.500 --> 01:17.530
.. an opportunity.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.690
Ah, still no answer.

01:19.740 --> 01:20.730
Theresa!

01:20.780 --> 01:23.210
We need to put our
personal differences aside.

01:23.260 --> 01:25.730
How can I help you keep
Scotland in the union?

01:25.780 --> 01:29.450
Lock yourself in a cupboard?
- You're overcompensating, aren't you?

01:29.500 --> 01:31.450
Because you find me intimidating.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.410
Theresa, can I just say that
in spite of having a cat fight

01:34.460 --> 01:38.610
with you in front of the Chinese
president, I want us to be friends.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.450
Are you fucking joking?

01:40.500 --> 01:45.050
Anyway, I need to try to change Nicola
Sturgeon's mind before her announcement on Sunday.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.850
Where's my room?
- Let me show you.

01:46.900 --> 01:53.010
I was about to fit this new carbon
monoxide alarm in there, anyway.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.930
And I'll conduct a battle for the hearts

01:54.980 --> 01:58.890
and minds of the Scots people,
starting at the Highland Games.

02:08.620 --> 02:13.570
You do not have the power of life
and death over caber tossers.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.290
I'm merely indicating
who's hot and who's not.

02:17.580 --> 02:18.770
Wills, where are you?

02:18.820 --> 02:21.770
You're supposed to be picking me
up and showing me the real Scotland!

02:21.820 --> 02:23.290
Sorry, I'm out of petrol.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.050
Funny how you always run out of
petrol when it's the Highland Games.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.250
Yeah, but this time I really have.
I'll be as quick as I can. - Hurry up!

02:29.300 --> 02:32.250
It's like watching a
two-hour advert for porridge.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.810
Something wrong?

02:33.860 --> 02:37.530
I want to go and do something
useful. I want to help Scotland.

02:37.580 --> 02:41.010
I know there's a drug problem
here. I've seen Trainspotting.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.610
Don't dress it up, Kate.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.450
You're just bored shitless
like everyone else.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.130
That's only half true.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.770
I want to use my time here
to help the indigenous people.

02:50.820 --> 02:54.570
And the first thing I've got
to do is get them off skag.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.770
Oh, this is wonderful.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.650
Fresh air, strong Scottish gorse...

03:03.420 --> 03:06.570
Even the midges have a brio
that eludes the English mosqui...

03:07.120 --> 03:07.860
Ooh!

03:18.340 --> 03:21.290
I think it's a bit rich getting
us to entertain some stuffy

03:21.340 --> 03:23.890
foreign dignitary when we're not
even on the sovereign ground.

03:23.940 --> 03:27.010
Eugenie, this could be our way back
in. Everyone else is in Scotland.

03:27.060 --> 03:30.410
Ooh, there's a party at Freddy
Windsor's! - You can't! - No!

03:30.460 --> 03:32.410
Bollocks to this. I'm off.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.530
Hi, I'm Justin Trudeau.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.450
Justin Trudeau, dreamboat
prime minister of Canada.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.250
I prefer to be thought of for my
humanitarian stance on refugees

03:42.300 --> 03:46.090
and my tattoo. You must be Beatrice?
- Actually, I'm Beatrice.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.850
Don't you have somewhere to be?
- No. Come in!

03:48.900 --> 03:51.850
I brought you this gift of Canadian
maple syrup. - I'll take that.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.130
She's on a diet? - Well, it
seems to be working. - Thank you.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.290
Yeah, but once the gastric band comes off,

03:57.340 --> 03:58.970
she'll ping back to her usual size?

03:59.020 --> 04:04.650
Justin, Justin, over here. I can do
a handstand. - Er, that's... very good!

04:04.700 --> 04:06.090
I've got an idea.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.250
Why don't me and you go
on a Chelsea pub crawl?

04:08.300 --> 04:10.290
Well, my people put
aside an hour for lunch.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.850
I don't think a pub crawl
is actually mentioned.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.250
I'd better come, too.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.899
When she's had a few, she starts fights.

04:20.019 --> 04:21.980
I saw him first!
- He's mine!

04:29.340 --> 04:30.900
Whoa!

04:32.260 --> 04:35.530
Pippa! - Hello, stranger!
- What're you doing here?

04:35.580 --> 04:37.370
Oh, I-I was just passing.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.970
Things are still great with
Johnny and everything, but, um...

04:40.020 --> 04:42.210
How's Meghan?
- I'm good!

04:42.260 --> 04:45.250
Hi, Pippa, good to see you!
- Oh!

04:45.300 --> 04:47.050
You're not in LA.
- No.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.130
Suits is on a hiatus so I'm interviewing

04:49.180 --> 04:52.090
for a bunch of creatively
exciting British projects.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.250
Yeah -- she's got an
audition for Hollyoaks.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.610
Congratulations! - Hm-mm. - Hey!
How about we go to lunch to celebrate?

04:58.660 --> 04:59.690
Great!

04:59.740 --> 05:03.290
But I should say I'm gluten-free
and lactose-intolerant this week.

05:03.340 --> 05:05.450
I shouldn't worry -- we'll
only be drinking wine!

05:05.500 --> 05:06.930
Well, this is fantastic.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.570
The girl I used to have sex with

05:08.620 --> 05:11.250
and the girl I'm currently
having sex with going for lunch.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.980
I've got a feeling you're
going to be friends for ever.

05:22.220 --> 05:25.620
Where am I? Argh!
- Steady there, laddy.

05:27.460 --> 05:31.810
Are you the one who shot me?
- Well, you were trespassing on my land.

05:31.860 --> 05:35.530
Hereabouts, they call me Flame.
And what might you be called?

05:35.580 --> 05:38.570
'She doesn't recognise me.
Must be these plasters.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.890
'I could be anonymous! Just
make up a normal name.'

05:41.940 --> 05:44.810
I'm Maximilian Forbes
Bowmaker Huntingdon Spank.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.610
The Third.
- Hm.

05:46.660 --> 05:49.490
English, are you?
- I prefer to say British and Northern Irish.

05:49.540 --> 05:51.250
Well, I dinnae like the English.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.770
As soon as your buttocks and
face have healed, you're out.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.410
In that case, you're going to have
to remove the shot from my bum now!

05:56.460 --> 05:58.090
All right!

05:58.140 --> 06:00.770
But I've nae medical training.
- I was in the Air Ambulance.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.770
You'll be my eyes and
ears. Get some tweezers.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.850
Will nae be spoken to
like that in my own croft!

06:04.900 --> 06:07.700
Well, you shouldn't have shot me
up the arse, then, should you?

06:14.380 --> 06:16.300
I'm on my holidays, I said.

06:18.060 --> 06:20.290
I dinnae care if Theresa
May's trying to find me.

06:20.340 --> 06:23.860
You tell her Nicola
Sturgeon says fuck off.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.490
And this is shortbread, is it?
- Aye, sir.

06:32.540 --> 06:35.210
Please stay in the UK,
please stay in the UK.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.850
And presumably these are
shortbread tins? - Aye, sir.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.410
Please don't leave us, please don't
leave us, please don't leave us...

06:40.460 --> 06:41.730
What are you doing?

06:41.780 --> 06:44.170
Helping Theresa by using
some subliminal messages

06:44.220 --> 06:46.490
to persuade the Scots to stay in the UK.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.450
Forget about Theresa.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.330
She's history.
- These flowers make me sniffly.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.050
Tissue.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.340
Oh, never mind.

06:58.980 --> 07:01.650
Charles, where are your Y-fronts?
- Oh, my!

07:01.700 --> 07:03.260
He's no' wearing any skiddies!

07:04.500 --> 07:05.650
He's a true Scot.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.100
We should stay in the union.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.090
This place looks like it
could do with a royal visit.

07:16.140 --> 07:19.140
Time to free Scotland
from the yoke of skag.

07:27.300 --> 07:31.810
My name's Kate. Princess Kate.
- Mmmmmm.

07:31.860 --> 07:35.810
And-and even though I'm a princess,
we're not so different, you and I.

07:35.860 --> 07:38.250
I'm from humble beginnings, too, you see,

07:38.300 --> 07:41.490
but I managed to turn my
life around just by hard work

07:41.540 --> 07:45.250
and making sure I went to the
same university as the future king.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.370
And now I'm going to be
queen. That's not bad, is it?

07:48.420 --> 07:50.970
Hmmmm.
- Hmmm!

07:51.020 --> 07:53.650
And once you're back on your feet,

07:53.700 --> 07:56.290
and we've smartened you up a bit,

07:56.340 --> 07:59.050
I don't think I'm building
your hopes up too much

07:59.100 --> 08:03.530
when I say I could see you marrying
into the Spanish royal family!

08:03.580 --> 08:05.140
Hmmmm.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.660
Well...

08:08.820 --> 08:12.100
There's only way I can
use my position to help.

08:13.940 --> 08:18.330
Hello, I'm Kate, Duchess of
Cambridge, and today I will be

08:18.380 --> 08:21.890
taking heroin, which is
another word for skag,

08:21.940 --> 08:24.260
to highlight this
uniquely Scottish problem.

08:27.260 --> 08:28.380
Here goes.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.490
There.

08:34.539 --> 08:37.370
This drug has blighted
whole communities aro...

08:37.419 --> 08:39.169
Oh!

08:39.220 --> 08:40.490
Oh!

08:40.539 --> 08:44.820
Fucking hell! Fuck!
That is fucking mental!

08:49.420 --> 08:51.210
Right, let's do it.

08:51.260 --> 08:54.290
I dinnae know if I can,
Maximillian. - You can.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.810
Now, how many holes can you see?
- Seven.

08:56.860 --> 08:59.490
Just the shot holes?
- Oh. Six.

08:59.540 --> 09:03.530
Right, now, take the tweezers and
remove the first piece of shot.

09:03.580 --> 09:06.450
I'm going in.
- Ow, no!

09:06.500 --> 09:09.290
Remember, just the shot holes!
- Sorry!

09:09.340 --> 09:12.970
I'm so nervous. - You've got
to relax. What makes you happiest?

09:13.020 --> 09:16.050
The idea of an independent Scotland.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.050
Good. What do you like about it?

09:18.100 --> 09:20.020
We could keep all the oil money.

09:22.340 --> 09:26.250
Excellent. Now you begin the operation.

09:26.300 --> 09:30.260
And fully exploit our wind resources.

09:33.540 --> 09:38.890
We can control our fishing industry
while remaining within the EU!

09:38.940 --> 09:40.940
All right, you can stop now, Flame!

09:41.980 --> 09:45.020
You've done it.
- Oh, that's brilliant!

09:46.180 --> 09:48.050
But it was you, Max.

09:48.100 --> 09:51.170
Getting me to relax by talking
about an independent Scotland.

09:51.220 --> 09:53.170
Well, then we both did it.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.820
Oh. I'd better get you some
bandages for your jacksy.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.140
Ooh!

10:04.220 --> 10:05.850
Nicola Sturgeon?

10:05.900 --> 10:09.260
So that's why she liked talking
about an independent Scotland!

10:15.141 --> 10:16.051
Here you go.

10:17.101 --> 10:19.811
I must say, I was surprised
an Englishman like yourself

10:19.861 --> 10:22.371
didn't have stronger views
about an independent Scotland.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.211
Well, I was trying to keep you relaxed.

10:24.261 --> 10:26.931
You were removing things
from my bottom, remember.

10:26.981 --> 10:28.981
I'll just get one myself.

10:32.581 --> 10:35.531
That lassie's in love with you.
- James I?!

10:35.581 --> 10:37.971
Aye, first king of Scotland and England.

10:38.021 --> 10:39.891
And you can use her
feelings for you to stop

10:39.941 --> 10:41.771
her from destroying our kingdom.

10:41.821 --> 10:44.251
She doesn't love me.
- She does.

10:44.301 --> 10:47.291
It happened when she was fixing
your arse and saw a bit of bollock.

10:47.341 --> 10:50.851
Even if that were true, as a
royal, I should stay neutral.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.811
But the union's at stake.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.571
Think on, laddie, think on.

10:55.621 --> 10:59.091
So, what do you think about
Scottish independence?

10:59.141 --> 11:03.821
Say for some mad reason I could
unilaterally pull us out of the UK?

11:05.541 --> 11:07.611
What would you say I should do?

11:07.661 --> 11:10.571
I...
- Go on, son!

11:10.621 --> 11:12.181
I would say...

11:14.221 --> 11:15.851
It's a matter for Scotland.

11:15.901 --> 11:19.221
Oh! You big streak of piss!

11:20.821 --> 11:23.011
Well, I better be off.

11:23.061 --> 11:25.011
The mist has come down.

11:25.061 --> 11:27.221
You're going naewhere
on a night like this.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.891
There's only one bed. I'll take the floor.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.451
Don't you be stupid, man.

11:33.501 --> 11:37.061
With your buttocks? It'll be warmer
with the two of us in the bed.

11:45.381 --> 11:49.011
Nightcap, Justin? Whisky? Brandy? Me?

11:50.301 --> 11:52.131
No, I really should be going.

11:52.181 --> 11:55.731
Hello, girls. Oh, who's this?

11:55.781 --> 11:59.451
Justin! But I've got a climate
conference in the morning.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.851
This is our...

12:00.901 --> 12:04.091
Cousin. I'm 32.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.051
Shall we have some music?

12:08.501 --> 12:12.371
Do you like Spandau Ballet, Justin?

12:12.421 --> 12:14.931
Yeah, I remember seeing them at Live Aid.

12:14.981 --> 12:18.571
Right... But Live Aid was '85,

12:18.621 --> 12:21.091
and if you're 32...

12:21.141 --> 12:22.731
Yes, I say saw them,

12:22.781 --> 12:25.861
I mean heard them,
through my mother's womb.

12:30.061 --> 12:33.821
Your cousin's very bubbly, in
that there's something almost...

12:38.141 --> 12:40.541
.. tragic aboot her.

12:44.861 --> 12:48.181
See, I told you I could stop
this independence nonsense.

12:50.101 --> 12:51.661
You're alive!

12:53.101 --> 12:56.011
I mean... You're up early.

12:56.061 --> 12:59.131
I always get up early.
- And you're feeling all right?

12:59.181 --> 13:01.771
Any nausea? Headaches? Sudden hair loss?

13:01.821 --> 13:04.651
Can you button the mindless prattle?
I got two hours' sleep in the study

13:04.701 --> 13:08.491
and I still haven't got
hold of Sturgeon. - Oh, I see.

13:08.541 --> 13:11.771
Well, if it's too much for you,
my husband could take over,

13:11.821 --> 13:14.731
as he should, according
to the new Magna Carta.

13:14.781 --> 13:17.131
I wouldn't put your husband
in charge of a compost heap.

13:17.181 --> 13:19.371
I outlived three compost heaps,

13:19.421 --> 13:21.141
only two of which have caught fire.

13:22.781 --> 13:25.571
Kate, come and say hello
to the Prime Minister.

13:25.621 --> 13:27.291
Good morning, Kate.

13:27.341 --> 13:29.221
Late night?

13:33.141 --> 13:36.421
I got really stuck into my book
and I couldn't put it down.

13:38.701 --> 13:40.541
Ahh!

13:43.901 --> 13:45.771
Ahh! Flame?

13:45.821 --> 13:48.891
You're not called Maximillian
Forbes Bowmaker Huntingdon Spank III

13:48.941 --> 13:51.611
at all. You're Prince William.

13:51.661 --> 13:54.131
Well... You're Nicola Sturgeon.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.731
No. Every year, first two
weeks of July, I come up here

13:57.781 --> 14:00.731
and adopt my holiday persona, Flame.

14:00.781 --> 14:02.291
How's she different to Nicola?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.221
She's not quite so tight with
money and she wears this wig.

14:06.901 --> 14:09.731
Look, you've spoilt my holiday
now. I'm back to being Nicola.

14:09.781 --> 14:11.411
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.

14:11.461 --> 14:12.771
And since I'm Nicola again,

14:12.821 --> 14:14.931
I might as well charge you
for that Scotch last night.

14:14.981 --> 14:18.141
I don't carry money.
- Then leave your jacket. I'll boot sell it.

14:22.381 --> 14:24.531
Can I just get my car keys out my pocket?

14:24.581 --> 14:27.261
No.
- Oh.

14:32.581 --> 14:36.691
Girls, I really should be going. The
embassy will be worried aboot me.

14:36.741 --> 14:39.411
And you've been drinking all
night. How do you manage it?

14:39.461 --> 14:42.291
Well, to be honest, it's half the job.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.491
Right.
- Well, I am going now.

14:44.541 --> 14:47.291
I have a breakfast meeting with the
governor of the Bank of England.

14:47.341 --> 14:48.571
Oh, but hold on, Justin.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.531
Before you go, which one of
us do you like best? - What?

14:51.581 --> 14:54.211
Neither, I'm married with two kids.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.571
You big fanny tears.

14:56.621 --> 14:58.731
I nearly put my back out
doing that handstand.

14:58.781 --> 15:01.131
Well, I'm sorry if you
misread the signals.

15:01.181 --> 15:03.501
You knew I was married,
didn't you, Fergie?

15:05.621 --> 15:08.491
But as the representative of
Canada, I'd like to thank you

15:08.541 --> 15:10.651
for the royal hospitality
extended to me in the form

15:10.701 --> 15:13.501
of a pub crawl and drinking
games till six in the morning.

15:14.461 --> 15:17.811
Well, he thought he was it, didn't he?
- Yeah, totally up himself.

15:17.861 --> 15:20.091
Mind you, he was good at Twister.

15:20.141 --> 15:22.651
Well, I think we've learned a
valuable lesson from tonight --

15:22.701 --> 15:25.211
let's never let a man
come between us again.

15:25.261 --> 15:27.611
Ovaries before brovaries.

15:27.661 --> 15:29.011
Oh, I've just had a thought.

15:29.061 --> 15:32.531
Since this was a royal duty, we
could claim it back on expenses.

15:32.581 --> 15:34.661
Did someone say expenses?

15:37.621 --> 15:39.051
This is fun.

15:39.101 --> 15:41.011
Like one of those female bonding scenes

15:41.061 --> 15:43.451
in my legal TV drama, Suits.

15:43.501 --> 15:46.611
Yes, it's so wonderful
you don't feel guilty

15:46.661 --> 15:49.131
about ruining Harry's life.
- What?

15:49.181 --> 15:51.371
Well, having people think he's an idiot,

15:51.421 --> 15:53.091
taken in by a trollop who

15:53.141 --> 15:56.091
flounces around town with her tits out.

15:56.141 --> 15:57.971
Not my words...

15:58.021 --> 15:59.491
The Mail Online.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.811
So, I'm making him
unpopular. I should leave.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.291
What about your Hollyoaks audition?

16:05.341 --> 16:08.691
Yes. Hollyoaks.

16:08.741 --> 16:11.211
But Harry's happiness is more important.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.171
I wish I hadn't said anything now.

16:13.221 --> 16:14.891
Booyakasha!

16:14.941 --> 16:17.171
Hope you don't mind me
crashing the girls-only lunch,

16:17.221 --> 16:19.451
but the amusement arcade had a power cut.

16:19.501 --> 16:21.291
Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry.

16:21.341 --> 16:23.011
I didn't mean to make you unpopular.

16:23.061 --> 16:24.411
I'm not that unpopular.

16:24.461 --> 16:27.771
A builder just gave me half his pie
and said, "Give Meghan one for me."

16:27.821 --> 16:29.971
Why would a builder give you half his pie

16:30.021 --> 16:31.661
if I was making you unpopular?

16:33.741 --> 16:36.691
You lied to me.
- Careful Meghan!

16:36.741 --> 16:39.691
That's slander, as you should
know from your TV show...

16:39.741 --> 16:40.891
Suits!

16:40.941 --> 16:44.211
It's because you still have
feelings for him, don't you?

16:44.261 --> 16:45.491
Don't be ridiculous.

16:45.541 --> 16:48.331
Yes, you do! And you're
trying to break us up.

16:48.381 --> 16:50.051
Well, you'll never do it.

16:50.101 --> 16:52.621
And I'm going to that Hollyoaks audition.

16:53.741 --> 16:55.611
Break a leg!

16:55.661 --> 16:58.331
What was that all about?
- Time of the month? - Oh, right.

16:58.381 --> 17:00.811
She'll be fine at the
audition, by the way. - Oh, yes?

17:00.861 --> 17:04.131
Yeah. Offered the producer a knighthood.

17:04.181 --> 17:06.701
Fancy some pie?
- Yes...

17:08.101 --> 17:10.300
.. I do.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.771
Oh, there you are.

17:16.820 --> 17:18.651
How was last night?

17:18.701 --> 17:22.330
Oh, I bumped into some old uni friends.

17:22.381 --> 17:24.371
Where were you?

17:24.421 --> 17:27.131
The same.

17:27.181 --> 17:30.171
I'll stand, actually. It's
better for the old circulation.

17:30.221 --> 17:31.731
Right.

17:31.781 --> 17:34.531
'The Duchess of Cambridge has
controversially taken heroin

17:34.581 --> 17:36.901
and streamed it live across the world.

17:37.941 --> 17:40.731
But her shock tactics seem to have worked,

17:40.781 --> 17:43.611
and eradicated Scotland's
unique drug problem.

17:43.661 --> 17:45.851
Addicts are throwing away their needles,

17:45.901 --> 17:47.571
dealers are becoming postmen,

17:47.621 --> 17:48.981
and this, from Afghanistan

17:54.981 --> 17:57.781
I've solved the drug problem
that was unique to Scotland!

17:59.941 --> 18:03.811
That's all very well,
Kate, but you lied to me.

18:03.861 --> 18:05.821
You lied to me.

18:15.421 --> 18:17.771
What are you doing in my room?

18:17.821 --> 18:19.651
Just checking the heating.

18:19.701 --> 18:22.251
You looked a little
chilly, earlier. - Oh.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.211
Of course, if you had
a stronger bloodline,

18:24.261 --> 18:25.531
you wouldn't feel the cold.

18:25.581 --> 18:29.011
And if you weren't so inbred you'd
have got more than one O level.

18:29.061 --> 18:31.251
Well...

18:31.301 --> 18:34.621
there you go. Nice and toasty.

18:39.061 --> 18:43.211
I don't know if I got the accent
right in my Hollyoaks audition.

18:43.261 --> 18:47.411
I can't believe I've been shagging
Derek and he turns out to be my dad.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.171
Is that OK?
- Whoa, that's awesome.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.281
It's your agent.

18:53.981 --> 18:57.011
Hello? Yes?

18:57.061 --> 19:00.211
You're kidding me! That's wonderful!

19:00.261 --> 19:03.691
Oh, thank you! Talk to you later.

19:03.741 --> 19:07.891
Harry, Harry, Harry! - Bad
news? - No, I got the part.

19:07.941 --> 19:10.131
I can relocate here and
we can be together.

19:10.181 --> 19:12.651
That's brilliant!

19:12.701 --> 19:15.851
Knock knock.
- What are you doing here?

19:15.901 --> 19:19.091
I came to return Harry's key,
from when we were together.

19:19.141 --> 19:22.011
I thought you were going
to be my no-BS BFF,

19:22.061 --> 19:25.491
but actually you're my BDE
- - boyfriend's dangerous ex.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.771
Just like in my TV show, Suits.

19:27.821 --> 19:29.531
Oh, you've got me all wrong, Meghan.

19:29.581 --> 19:32.851
Did I hear celebrating?
- Yeah, Meghan got that part in Hollyoaks.

19:32.901 --> 19:35.411
Well done! That's wonderful.

19:35.461 --> 19:38.731
Good job you made that call,
Harry. Oops. - What call?

19:38.781 --> 19:41.971
Have I said something wrong?
- What's going on?

19:42.021 --> 19:44.691
Well, I may have called the producer,

19:44.741 --> 19:48.011
and might have offered him a
knighthood to give you that part.

19:48.061 --> 19:52.611
I can't believe you did that! - But
I only wanted to help. - No, Harry.

19:52.661 --> 19:55.851
If I'm going to make it, and I
mean really make it, it has to be

19:55.901 --> 19:58.931
because of who I am, not
because of who I know.

19:58.981 --> 20:02.211
Sure, our relationship
has boosted my profile,

20:02.261 --> 20:05.571
but that's just something
I've had to deal with,

20:05.621 --> 20:06.891
as a woman.

20:06.941 --> 20:08.451
I'm going back to LA.

20:08.501 --> 20:11.381
You're welcome to join me,
Harry, but I can't stay here.

20:12.861 --> 20:15.771
Goodbye.

20:15.821 --> 20:17.851
Meghan!

20:17.901 --> 20:20.701
Oh! And LA's so far away.

20:22.061 --> 20:25.101
Do you think a long distance
relationship can work?

20:26.301 --> 20:28.771
I've got to be honest...

20:28.821 --> 20:31.301
No.

20:36.981 --> 20:40.371
I never wear anything under my
kilt, so the only thing between you

20:40.421 --> 20:44.461
and my genitalia is this rather
course, scratchy piece of tartan.

20:45.541 --> 20:46.771
Mmm.

20:46.821 --> 20:50.131
Where's the Prime Minister?
- Well, I believe she's still getting changed.

20:50.181 --> 20:51.811
You know what women are like.

20:51.861 --> 20:53.771
Oh, you're a woman.

20:53.821 --> 20:56.981
Well, you can see how I made the
mistake, you are rather mannish.

21:00.061 --> 21:01.771
Right.

21:01.821 --> 21:03.731
Excuse me.

21:03.781 --> 21:07.211
Sorry to interrupt the sweet,
sweet music of the bagpipes,

21:07.261 --> 21:10.011
but it's time I made my
announcement regarding the future

21:10.061 --> 21:12.331
of our fair country.

21:12.381 --> 21:16.011
I've made my decision about
Scotland leaving the UK,

21:16.061 --> 21:17.821
and that decision is...

21:20.101 --> 21:22.181
At least I'd thought I'd made my decision.

21:23.781 --> 21:27.891
See, last night a handsome young
Englishman came into my croft

21:27.941 --> 21:30.611
with substantial gunshot
wounds to his backside.

21:30.661 --> 21:33.691
I dressed his wounds,
gave him Savlon and Scotch,

21:33.741 --> 21:35.531
and then he shared my bed.

21:35.581 --> 21:36.691
Shall we go for a drink?

21:36.741 --> 21:39.461
And I'm not afraid to say
that I fell in love with him.

21:42.341 --> 21:45.491
And if I can fall in love
with a stuck-up Englishman...

21:45.541 --> 21:48.371
Me, a sour-faced, humourless Scot,

21:48.421 --> 21:52.171
then can't Scotland once again
fall in love with England?

21:52.221 --> 21:55.131
We will remain as part of the UK.

21:58.381 --> 22:00.611
Yes! I did it!

22:00.661 --> 22:03.141
Well, that's good news. How about a walk.

22:04.221 --> 22:06.411
Hello, Wills. How's the arse?

22:06.461 --> 22:10.411
Oh, Nicola, isn't it? Sturgeon?

22:10.461 --> 22:13.371
You know, now I think about it,
I didn't bump into old uni mates.

22:13.421 --> 22:15.731
Nicola Sturgeon shot me up the arse

22:15.781 --> 22:18.051
and I had to stay the night in her croft.

22:18.101 --> 22:21.141
I just came to say... fare thee well.

22:22.221 --> 22:25.411
And thank you for helping me love again.

22:25.461 --> 22:27.581
Right, see you, bye.

22:30.541 --> 22:34.451
Nothing happened. - Don't
worry, Wills. - I trust you.

22:34.501 --> 22:37.931
But can you now forgive me for lying
about taking skag on the telly?

22:37.981 --> 22:39.211
Of course, no problem.

22:39.261 --> 22:41.811
Terrible news, everyone!

22:41.861 --> 22:45.171
Theresa May, our Prime Minister...

22:45.221 --> 22:46.531
is dead!

22:48.341 --> 22:51.581
And given the new Magna Carta,
that makes my husband, Charles...

22:53.181 --> 22:55.861
.. absolute monarch.
