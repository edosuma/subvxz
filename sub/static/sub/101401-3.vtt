Good. Well, then

from Socrates' actions

08:08.522 --> 08:10.624
in front of the Athenian court?

08:10.657 --> 08:11.959
Nothing.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.694

was very stupid

08:13.727 --> 08:15.996
to not defend himself,
actually.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.231

08:30.177 --> 08:31.979

in Socrates' actions.

of the-of the courtroom,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.619

08:38.652 --> 08:39.953

08:39.987 --> 08:42.589
and forget of those accusations
levied against him.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.158
That's why he died.
You find that virtuous?

08:46.593 --> 08:48.862
Socrates was making a point
about the invalidity

08:48.896 --> 08:51.598
of the accusations
against him, okay?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.300
I-is there no room--

08:53.533 --> 08:55.702
Socrates was a victim
of his own hubris.

status grants them immunity
