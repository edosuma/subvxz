WEBVTT

00:05.808 --> 00:08.809
Captain's log, stardate 5943.7.

00:08.978 --> 00:10.852
We have calculated that Beta Niobe

00:11.022 --> 00:14.687
will go nova in approximately
three and a half hours.

00:14.859 --> 00:18.442
Its only satellite, Sarpeidon,
is a Class-M planet,

00:18.613 --> 00:23.192
which, at last report, was inhabited
by a civilised humanoid species.

00:23.368 --> 00:24.531
Now our instruments show

00:24.703 --> 00:27.657
that no intelligent life remains
on the planet.

00:27.831 --> 00:30.536
The power source we detected
is in this building, captain.

00:30.709 --> 00:34.789
- Any sign of survivors?
- No signs of sapient life forms.

00:34.963 --> 00:37.371
How can a whole planet full of people
just disappear?

00:37.549 --> 00:38.960
If they knew that the sun was dying,

00:39.134 --> 00:41.174
it could be anything
up to mass suicide.

00:41.345 --> 00:45.046
Reports deny that they had
any space-flight capability.

00:45.599 --> 00:49.728
This appears to be an archive
or library of some kind.

00:50.479 --> 00:53.895
Then we're certainly in the right place
to find out what happened,

00:54.066 --> 00:57.436
where the inhabitants are,
and if there are any left now.

00:58.196 --> 01:01.695
- Well, that's fine. Where do we start?
- May I help you?

01:03.409 --> 01:05.698
I am the librarian.

01:05.870 --> 01:07.413
May I be of assistance?

01:07.580 --> 01:10.950
- Perhaps you can, Mr?
- Mr. Atoz.

01:11.126 --> 01:13.747
I confess
that I'm a little surprised to see you.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.079
I had thought
that everyone had long since gone.

01:18.091 --> 01:20.049
But the surprise is a pleasant one.

01:20.219 --> 01:24.168
After all, a library serves no purpose
unless someone is using it.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.264
You say everyone is gone.
Where'd they go?

01:26.433 --> 01:28.924
It depended on the individual,
of course.

01:29.103 --> 01:30.727
If you wish to trace a specific person,

01:30.896 --> 01:34.063
I'm sorry,
but that information is confidential.

01:34.233 --> 01:37.151
No, no particular person,
just people in general.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.778
Where did they go?

01:38.946 --> 01:41.402
You find it difficult to choose,
is that it?

01:42.283 --> 01:46.067
Yes, a wide range of alternatives
is a mixed blessing.

01:46.245 --> 01:49.780
But perhaps I can help.
Would you step this way, please?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:01.094 --> 02:02.257
May I help you?

02:02.846 --> 02:06.844
You may select
from more than 20,000 verisim tapes,

02:07.017 --> 02:10.681
several hundred of which have only
recently been added to the collection.

02:10.854 --> 02:13.524
I'm sure you'll find something here
that pleases you.

02:13.691 --> 02:17.060
You, sir. What is your particular field
of interest?

02:17.236 --> 02:20.320
- What about recent history?
- Really? That's too bad.

02:20.489 --> 02:24.404
We have so little on recent history.
There was no demand for it.

02:24.577 --> 02:27.993
It doesn't have to be extensive.
Just the answers to a few questions.

02:28.831 --> 02:30.409
Of course.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.999
Reference service is available
at the desk.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.468
You're very late.
Where have you been?

02:46.975 --> 02:50.012
You're a very agile man, Mr. Atoz.

02:50.187 --> 02:52.014
Just how many of you are there?

03:05.327 --> 03:08.744
Space, the final frontier.

03:14.212 --> 03:18.375
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:18.550 --> 03:22.547
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:22.720 --> 03:26.505
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:26.683 --> 03:30.182
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:17.652 --> 04:20.523
We came as soon as we knew
what was happening.

04:20.697 --> 04:24.565
Forgive me, sir. It is my fault.
I must have miscalculated.

04:24.743 --> 04:27.413
Our readings indicated
that there was no one here at all.

04:27.579 --> 04:28.778
Of course I know.

04:28.956 --> 04:32.574
Everyone on this planet was warned
of the coming nova long ago.

04:32.751 --> 04:34.910
They followed instructions
and are now safe.

04:35.087 --> 04:36.747
And you had better do the same.

04:37.214 --> 04:40.797
- Did you say they were safe?
- Absolutely. Every single one.

04:41.260 --> 04:42.292
Where did they go?

04:42.470 --> 04:44.427
Wherever they wanted to go,
of course.

04:44.597 --> 04:46.969
It is strictly
up to the individual's choice.

04:47.266 --> 04:48.891
I see.

04:49.310 --> 04:52.644
And you personally sent
all these people

04:52.814 --> 04:54.059
on the planet to safety?

04:54.232 --> 04:58.978
Yes, yes, yes.
They are all gone, except you three.

04:59.154 --> 05:03.982
Of course, I had to delegate
the simple tasks to my replicas.

05:07.329 --> 05:10.663
You are the real one, Mr. Atoz?

05:10.958 --> 05:14.327
Of course. I am the real Mr. Atoz.

05:14.503 --> 05:17.504
As a matter of fact,
he's quite real, Jim.

05:20.426 --> 05:22.335
Let us take you with us
to a place of safety.

05:22.511 --> 05:27.506
No, thank you. I plan to join my wife
and family when the time comes.

05:27.683 --> 05:31.218
Now, don't be concerned about me.
Think of yourselves.

05:31.396 --> 05:35.524
I warn you most urgently.
Make your escape before it's too late.

05:37.861 --> 05:40.352
The library
is at your complete service.

05:40.530 --> 05:44.029
I will gladly supply you
with all reference material to help you.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.617
History of the planet
is available in every detail.

05:47.788 --> 05:50.623
Just choose
what interests you the most.

05:50.791 --> 05:56.247
The millennium, the century, the date,
the moment. The library is your key.

05:56.964 --> 05:58.339
It's in the wrong file.

05:58.507 --> 06:01.591
Well, make your own selection,
but remember you're very late.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.216
Yes, we'll choose it as quick
as we can. How long till nova?

06:04.388 --> 06:06.926
- Three hours, 13 minutes.
- This gentleman is not...

06:07.099 --> 06:08.297
Hey, you, sir.

06:08.476 --> 06:11.726
I think you'll find something interesting
over here.

06:19.862 --> 06:24.074
Now, if these won't do,
I can bring you another file.

07:01.823 --> 07:03.981
Have you made your selection, sir?

07:04.158 --> 07:06.696
Exactly what is it
that I'm expected to select?

07:06.870 --> 07:10.784
I'm sure I was clear.
The period in which you're interested.

07:10.957 --> 07:12.286
I see.

07:12.459 --> 07:15.662
This is a fascinating machine.
What is it?

07:16.213 --> 07:18.122
This is the atavachron.

07:18.465 --> 07:22.297
Interesting nomenclature.
Now, how does it work? May I?

07:22.469 --> 07:23.963
Oh, no, sir. No.

07:24.137 --> 07:26.807
I must ask you not to touch
the controlling mechanism.

07:26.974 --> 07:28.302
Return and make your selection.

07:29.017 --> 07:30.428
When you have chosen,

07:30.602 --> 07:33.936
I will prepare you
through the atavachron.

07:35.107 --> 07:37.598
Thank you, Mr. Atoz.

07:47.995 --> 07:49.075
Spock. Bones.

07:49.247 --> 07:52.164
Wait. I haven't prepared you.

08:04.012 --> 08:06.337
You must be prepared.

08:12.563 --> 08:15.848
- What is this place?
- Yes, and where is the captain?

08:16.191 --> 08:19.145
You dirty thing. Let go of me.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.489
Vile vixen.

08:27.703 --> 08:30.740
Come when you are bidden, slave.

08:33.292 --> 08:36.246
You need a lesson
in how to use your betters.

08:36.421 --> 08:37.914
Who's your master?

08:38.089 --> 08:39.881
I'm a free man, sir.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.671
You're gonna want better manners,
free man.

08:42.844 --> 08:44.718
Defend yourself.

09:17.088 --> 09:20.421
Heating this boulder
may provide some temporary heat.

09:24.637 --> 09:25.669
What's wrong?

09:25.847 --> 09:28.765
Something's preventing my phaser
from operating.

09:33.647 --> 09:34.975
Thank you, man.

09:35.148 --> 09:37.307
I thought I'd be limbered sure

09:37.484 --> 09:39.192
when that gull caught me
cutting his purse.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.315
What's that? Are you all right?

09:43.365 --> 09:45.607
I took you to be an Anglo,

09:45.784 --> 09:48.619
but you're none of us, are you?

09:50.706 --> 09:54.122
- You're a bully fine cool for all of that.
- Thank you.

09:54.293 --> 09:58.243
What a handsome dish
you served them, the coxco...

09:58.422 --> 10:01.210
You better come back with me
to the library. You'll be safe there.

10:01.384 --> 10:06.723
- Dr. McCoy can see to those bruises.
- I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow.

10:06.889 --> 10:10.424
- Where's library?
- Right over th...

10:25.701 --> 10:29.236
Where's the captain, Spock?
We were right behind him.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.287
What's with you, man?

10:37.463 --> 10:39.954
Let's make off before coxcombs
come with shoulder clappers.

10:40.132 --> 10:41.461
No, no. Come here.

10:41.634 --> 10:43.176
Do you remember
when you first saw me?

10:43.344 --> 10:46.927
Do you remember whether I came
through some kind of door?

10:47.098 --> 10:49.671
I think the wrong gull
must have kicked you in the head.

10:49.851 --> 10:52.805
Come on, love. I know a leech
who'll ask no questions.

10:52.979 --> 10:54.722
No, no. It must be here someplace.

10:54.898 --> 10:59.690
- Jim. Jim, can you hear us?
- Bones? Spock?

11:00.320 --> 11:03.440
Captain, we hear you,
but we cannot see you.

11:04.366 --> 11:06.489
Are you all right?

11:07.035 --> 11:08.577
We must have missed each other
somehow.

11:08.745 --> 11:09.777
Agreed.

11:10.038 --> 11:13.039
Apparently, they have all escaped
the destruction of their world

11:13.208 --> 11:15.331
by retreating into its past.

11:15.502 --> 11:19.002
- Mercy on us. It's spirits.
- No, no, no.

11:19.173 --> 11:21.711
These are friends of mine. They're...

11:22.426 --> 11:25.712
- Spock, are you in the library?
- Indeed not.

11:25.888 --> 11:28.723
We're in a wilderness
of arctic characteristics.

11:28.891 --> 11:32.177
- He means it's cold.
- Can you get back to the library?

11:33.020 --> 11:37.398
There is no library, captain.
At least not that we can see.

11:37.817 --> 11:40.059
We are at the base of an ice cliff.

11:40.528 --> 11:41.559
Explain.

11:41.905 --> 11:44.277
Just before you disappeared,
captain,

11:44.449 --> 11:48.696
I discovered a machine
which Mr. Atoz called the atavachron.

11:48.954 --> 11:52.998
It must have been tied
into the tape viewer somehow.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.492
Opening time portals to the past.

11:56.670 --> 11:59.588
You cross through into the period
which you were viewing.

11:59.756 --> 12:02.426
I was looking over some material
about their ice age.

12:02.593 --> 12:03.968
And I am here, evidently,

12:04.136 --> 12:08.086
because I stepped through
at the same instant as Dr. McCoy.

12:08.682 --> 12:10.177
Yes.

12:13.145 --> 12:15.767
My friends are coming back
with reinforcements.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.517
There's the mort's accomplice.
Arrest him.

12:18.693 --> 12:22.441
We are the law
and do require that you yield to us.

12:22.613 --> 12:24.440
- On what charge?
- Thievery and purse cutting.

12:24.616 --> 12:27.285
- That is a mistake. I'm no thief.
- What's happening?

12:27.452 --> 12:30.287
- Lord, help us. What's that?
- It's spirits.

12:30.455 --> 12:32.946
Away, away, spirit,
and let honest men approach.

12:33.124 --> 12:34.619
- Keep talking.
- Captain.

12:34.793 --> 12:36.335
They speak at his bidding.

12:36.503 --> 12:40.204
- Stop his mouth, and they'll quiet.
- You must be close to the portal.

12:40.382 --> 12:42.291
Keep talking now.

12:45.345 --> 12:46.543
Jim, what's the matter?

12:51.185 --> 12:54.636
- Jim sounded like he was in trouble.
- We may be in trouble ourselves.

12:54.814 --> 12:57.352
We must find shelter.

13:17.837 --> 13:21.004
In this severe cold,
we cannot survive much longer.

13:21.174 --> 13:23.333
Leave me here, Spock.

13:23.510 --> 13:26.713
- We go together or not at all.
- Don't be a fool.

13:26.888 --> 13:30.507
My hands and face are frostbitten.
I can't feel my feet.

13:30.684 --> 13:34.349
Alone, you have a chance.
Now, do what I say. Go try to find Jim.

13:34.521 --> 13:36.561
We go together.

13:36.732 --> 13:40.481
You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan.

14:41.883 --> 14:44.754
Suffering from the severity
of your weather.

14:46.304 --> 14:50.682
Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I.

15:08.535 --> 15:12.284
I'll avoid giving him any medication
at this time.

15:12.790 --> 15:16.241
Perhaps if he's kept quiet and warm,
he may recover naturally.

15:17.670 --> 15:19.378
It is agreeably warm here.

15:23.968 --> 15:25.297
What are you called?

15:26.971 --> 15:28.430
I'm called Spock.

15:30.099 --> 15:32.555
Even your name is strange.

15:33.311 --> 15:34.640
Forgive me.

15:34.813 --> 15:36.722
I've never seen anyone
who looks like you.

15:53.874 --> 15:57.374
Why are you here?
Are you prisoners too?

15:57.545 --> 15:59.003
Prisoners?

15:59.171 --> 16:01.330
This is one of the places
Zor Khan sends people

16:01.507 --> 16:03.963
when he wants them to disappear.

16:05.887 --> 16:07.547
Didn't you come in
through the time portal?

16:07.722 --> 16:10.842
Yes, we came through the time portal,
but not as prisoners.

16:11.017 --> 16:13.175
We were sent here by mistake.

16:15.522 --> 16:18.191
The atavachron is far away,

16:18.358 --> 16:21.941
but I think you come
from someplace farther than that.

16:22.487 --> 16:23.650
That is true.

16:24.156 --> 16:27.026
I am not from the world you know
at all.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.616
My home is a planet
millions of light-years away.

16:30.787 --> 16:32.330
How wonderful.

16:32.498 --> 16:35.748
I've always loved books
about such possibilities.

16:39.380 --> 16:40.708
But they are only stories.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.336
This isn't real.

16:48.014 --> 16:50.635
I must be imagining all this.

16:52.977 --> 16:55.184
I'm going mad.

16:57.899 --> 17:02.110
Listen to me.
I am firmly convinced that I do exist.

17:02.278 --> 17:04.816
I am substantial.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.231
You are not imagining this.

17:11.747 --> 17:15.446
I've been here for so long. Alone.

17:17.085 --> 17:21.582
When I saw you out there,
I couldn't believe it.

17:35.730 --> 17:37.604
Is he dying?

17:57.502 --> 17:59.958
Here. There's the mort.

18:00.964 --> 18:03.206
And there's the mort's henchman.

18:07.137 --> 18:08.762
Open up.

18:14.645 --> 18:16.305
Rouse him.

18:33.915 --> 18:36.786
You are the thief who talks to spirits.

18:37.586 --> 18:40.124
No. I'm a stranger.

18:40.672 --> 18:42.131
Where are you from?

18:42.632 --> 18:46.132
- An island.
- What is this island?

18:49.431 --> 18:50.712
It's called Earth.

18:52.643 --> 18:55.976
I know no island Earth.

18:56.605 --> 18:57.934
No matter. Continue.

18:58.858 --> 19:01.645
I never saw that woman
before tonight.

19:03.904 --> 19:07.689
When she screamed,
as far as I could tell,

19:08.034 --> 19:09.362
she was being attacked.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.362
Then you deny
being her accomplice?

19:11.537 --> 19:13.577
Yes, I deny it.

19:13.748 --> 19:17.366
I was reading in the library
when I heard her scream.

19:21.006 --> 19:24.955
My lord, the library. Do you remember
where the library is, my lord?

19:25.135 --> 19:29.464
Perhaps your part in this is innocent.

19:30.349 --> 19:33.800
- I believe you to be an honest man.
- He's a witch.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.430
Take care, woman.

19:38.607 --> 19:41.063
I'm convinced of your guilt.

19:41.235 --> 19:44.485
Do not compound it
with false accusation.

19:44.655 --> 19:48.985
He speaks to unseen spirits.
He's a witch.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.576
- You heard the voices.
- It's truth, my lord.

19:53.998 --> 19:59.241
I heard the spirit talk to him.
He answered and did call it Bones.

19:59.420 --> 20:00.831
You're a witch.

20:01.005 --> 20:05.502
He cast a spell.
He made me steal against my wish.

20:05.927 --> 20:08.086
Surely you don't believe...

20:14.352 --> 20:18.350
- You heard these spirits?
- Aye, my lord.

20:18.523 --> 20:19.603
I'll witness to it.

20:20.108 --> 20:22.018
What he heard, my lord,

20:22.194 --> 20:26.773
were only my friends behind the wall,
in the library.

20:28.117 --> 20:29.196
In the library.

20:29.368 --> 20:31.242
- I know nothing of this.
- The library.

20:31.412 --> 20:33.036
Send for someone learned
in witchcraft,

20:33.205 --> 20:37.037
and let him examine him.
I will have nothing to do with him.

20:37.418 --> 20:38.663
My lord.

20:38.836 --> 20:40.663
At least arrange
for me to meet Mr. Atoz.

20:40.838 --> 20:42.119
- I know no Atoz.
- Yes.

20:42.298 --> 20:44.006
- Yes, Atoz.
- I know nothing of this.

20:44.175 --> 20:45.919
Nothing of these matters.

20:46.094 --> 20:48.383
- I will not hear him.
- Let me speak to you!

20:48.555 --> 20:50.464
I will not hear him!

20:50.640 --> 20:52.965
At least let me talk to you.

20:56.188 --> 21:01.775
Witch. Witch. Witch.

21:01.943 --> 21:05.110
They'll burn you.

21:20.338 --> 21:21.832
McCoy.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.009
McCoy, wake up.

21:30.682 --> 21:34.264
- Who are you?
- My name is Zarabeth.

21:35.019 --> 21:37.012
Zarabeth.

21:38.606 --> 21:40.184
Spock, are we in the library?

21:40.358 --> 21:44.190
No, we are still in the ice age,
but safe for the moment.

21:44.362 --> 21:45.987
Jim.

21:46.948 --> 21:49.025
- What about Jim?
- You're in no condition to get up.

21:49.201 --> 21:50.992
You lie down and rest.

21:51.161 --> 21:54.079
I shall attempt to find the captain.

21:54.248 --> 21:56.703
Well, you find him, Spock.

21:57.209 --> 22:01.207
Don't you worry about me.
You just find him.

22:21.735 --> 22:23.193
Spock.

22:26.114 --> 22:28.154
Who is this Jim?

22:28.575 --> 22:30.781
He's our commanding officer.

22:31.161 --> 22:32.572
And our friend.

22:32.746 --> 22:35.284
I saw only the two of you.
I did not know there was another.

22:35.457 --> 22:37.913
He did not come with us.
He was sent through the time portal

22:38.085 --> 22:41.536
to another period in history
much later than this one.

22:42.423 --> 22:44.499
If I am to find him,

22:45.551 --> 22:48.552
there's only one possible avenue.

22:50.765 --> 22:53.719
Zarabeth, will you show me
where the time portal is?

22:54.393 --> 22:57.264
But your friend. He is ill.

22:58.106 --> 22:59.766
That is true.

23:00.274 --> 23:03.026
If I leave him, there's a chance
he may never regain the ship.

23:03.194 --> 23:05.353
He would then be marooned
in this time period,

23:05.530 --> 23:07.606
but he is no longer
in danger of death.

23:07.782 --> 23:10.534
So my primary duty to him
has been discharged.

23:10.702 --> 23:12.908
And if I remain here,

23:13.079 --> 23:15.701
no one of our party

23:15.874 --> 23:18.282
would be able to aid Captain Kirk.

23:19.086 --> 23:22.751
- You make it sound like an equation.
- Well, it should be an equation.

23:23.298 --> 23:25.872
I should be able
to resolve this problem logically.

23:30.306 --> 23:33.141
Perhaps it has something
to do with the atavachron.

23:35.227 --> 23:37.979
If only I knew more
about how it worked.

23:40.149 --> 23:41.478
Zarabeth.

23:41.651 --> 23:44.224
You said that you were brought here
as a prisoner.

23:44.946 --> 23:47.104
- May I ask?
- Why?

23:49.784 --> 23:53.782
My crime was in choosing my kinsmen
unwisely.

23:56.166 --> 23:59.914
Two of them were involved
in a conspiracy to kill Zor Khan.

24:00.086 --> 24:03.123
I remember that name
from the history tapes in the library.

24:03.507 --> 24:05.796
Zor Kahn the tyrant.

24:06.051 --> 24:08.803
It was not enough
that he execute my kinsmen.

24:08.971 --> 24:12.221
Zor Kahn determined
to destroy our entire family.

24:12.391 --> 24:16.603
He used the atavachron to send us
places no one could ever find us.

24:16.770 --> 24:20.021
Zarabeth, we must return to Mr. Atoz
and the atavachron.

24:20.191 --> 24:23.145
We will carry Dr. McCoy,
and you must come with us.

24:23.319 --> 24:25.691
I will send you and the doctor
to the ship,

24:25.863 --> 24:27.856
and I shall search for Captain Kirk.

24:28.032 --> 24:33.489
I can't go through the portal again.
If I do, I will die.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.915
You cannot go back?

24:42.047 --> 24:44.253
None of us can go back.

24:45.467 --> 24:48.503
When we come through the portal,
we are changed by the atavachron.

24:49.304 --> 24:51.213
That is its function.

24:51.390 --> 24:55.304
Our basic cell structure is adjusted
to the time we enter.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.392
You can't go back.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.061
If you go through the portal again,

25:06.238 --> 25:09.074
you will die
by the time you reach the other side.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.777
Spock.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.238
Where are we?

25:17.166 --> 25:19.289
You are safe here, McCoy.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.749
Yes, I remember you.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.080
Come, doctor. Back to bed.

25:29.888 --> 25:33.589
Why are you still here, Spock?
Why aren't you looking for Jim?

25:33.975 --> 25:37.392
It is impossible to look for him, doctor.
We cannot go back.

25:38.355 --> 25:40.893
What do you mean, impossible?
We've gotta get back.

25:41.066 --> 25:42.893
Zarabeth explained it to me.

25:43.068 --> 25:44.693
When we came
through the time portal,

25:44.862 --> 25:47.269
it altered our physiological structure.

25:47.448 --> 25:52.359
If we attempt to return to the library,
we shall die.

25:52.536 --> 25:55.988
Are you trying to tell me
that we're trapped here?

25:56.541 --> 25:59.625
Yes, doctor. We are trapped.

25:59.794 --> 26:03.128
Just as Jim is trapped
wherever he is.

26:06.426 --> 26:09.795
Captain's log, stardate 5943.9.

26:09.971 --> 26:11.964
The people of this time
believe in witches,

26:12.140 --> 26:14.512
and witchcraft
is what I've been accused of.

26:14.684 --> 26:17.175
Five witnesses
heard McCoy's voice speak to me

26:17.354 --> 26:19.560
and thought it was an evil spirit.

26:19.731 --> 26:21.854
From what I know of witchcraft trials,

26:22.025 --> 26:26.771
I don't have much chance
unless I can get to the prosecutor.

26:28.449 --> 26:30.904
No supper for you, love.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.575
Come on.

26:37.249 --> 26:38.957
Up you go.

26:53.224 --> 26:55.016
Give me your cup.

27:04.152 --> 27:07.403
Cry out, and I'll break it.

27:15.289 --> 27:16.783
Don't move.

27:50.242 --> 27:52.069
Jailor.

27:52.911 --> 27:54.820
Jailor.

27:57.082 --> 27:59.704
I'm being falsely accused.
You know that.

27:59.877 --> 28:03.744
You will come with me
before the inquisitional tribunal,

28:03.923 --> 28:06.592
and there the matter of your witchcraft
will be decided.

28:06.759 --> 28:08.917
- There are no such things as witches.
- Jailor.

28:09.095 --> 28:11.004
That is sacrilege.

28:11.180 --> 28:14.098
If they hear you,
they will burn you for such beliefs.

28:14.267 --> 28:16.639
You're the only one that can hear me,
and that's the truth.

28:16.811 --> 28:19.563
There are no witches.
Why do you deny it?

28:19.731 --> 28:25.686
Do not let them hear you.
There are witches. There are.

28:25.862 --> 28:29.776
You yourself may be discovered
to be a witch by the inquisitor.

28:29.950 --> 28:34.030
No. What are you doing?

28:34.454 --> 28:36.032
No.

28:36.498 --> 28:38.455
Help.

28:43.672 --> 28:46.590
I'll denounce you to the inquisitor.

28:46.759 --> 28:49.084
You came here from the future,
just as I did.

28:49.261 --> 28:54.600
- Therefore, you too are a witch.
- I beg you, do not implicate me.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.475
- They would burn me.
- Then help me.

28:56.978 --> 29:00.097
I will do everything I can
to prove you innocent.

29:00.273 --> 29:03.060
I will disprove all the charges
of witchcraft.

29:03.234 --> 29:07.813
But you must never again
speak to the comrades you left behind.

29:07.989 --> 29:11.440
Help me return to the library.
I've lost my way. I must get back there.

29:11.618 --> 29:15.117
- You cannot get back.
- I tell you I must.

29:15.372 --> 29:18.373
I had two friends with me
who are lost in another time period.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.914
I must find them.
You'll come back with us.

29:21.086 --> 29:22.829
We can never go back.

29:23.005 --> 29:27.216
We must live out our lives
here in the past.

29:27.384 --> 29:29.875
The atavachron has prepared
our cell structure

29:30.054 --> 29:35.344
and our brain patterns
to make life natural here.

29:35.684 --> 29:39.184
To return to the future
would mean instant death.

29:39.688 --> 29:41.231
Prepare?

29:42.525 --> 29:43.805
I was not prepared.

29:43.985 --> 29:47.021
Your Mr. Atoz did not prepare me
in any way.

29:47.196 --> 29:49.522
Then you must get back at once.

29:49.699 --> 29:51.905
If you were not transformed,

29:52.076 --> 29:56.573
you can only survive for a few hours
here in the past.

29:58.833 --> 30:02.202
Come. Hurry. Hurry.

30:07.884 --> 30:10.376
Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.638
- Have you ever been told that?
- Not recently.

30:13.807 --> 30:18.101
Oh, well, you'll find that Spock
is quite delinquent in those matters.

30:18.270 --> 30:20.310
I hadn't noticed it.

30:26.237 --> 30:27.565
Well, now that I'm feeling better,

30:27.738 --> 30:30.490
you'll notice a distinct difference
in our approach.

30:30.658 --> 30:31.986
Really?

30:32.160 --> 30:33.903
It's something to look forward to.

30:34.078 --> 30:35.620
I think you must be well enough,
doctor,

30:35.788 --> 30:38.161
to try the few delicacies
this climate has to offer.

30:38.333 --> 30:39.578
No, not yet.

30:39.751 --> 30:42.918
At your rate of progress, it will be soon,
I can see.

30:43.171 --> 30:45.579
Dr. McCoy
is making excellent progress.

30:46.466 --> 30:48.506
And Mr. Spock
has been practising medicine

30:48.677 --> 30:50.135
without a licence, now.

30:50.303 --> 30:52.759
Don't let him doctor you.
I'm the doctor around here.

30:52.931 --> 30:57.593
And known as the worst patient
in the entire crew of the Enterprise.

30:57.769 --> 30:59.561
I wonder where she is.

31:00.814 --> 31:02.771
Five thousand years in the future.

31:07.238 --> 31:08.696
Thank you.

31:24.881 --> 31:26.874
I wonder where Jim is.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.627
Who knows?

31:29.094 --> 31:32.048
We can only hope that he is well,
wherever he is.

31:32.222 --> 31:35.638
What do you mean, we can only hope?
Haven't you done anything about it?

31:35.809 --> 31:36.972
What was there to do?

31:37.144 --> 31:39.469
You could locate the portal.
It can't be too far.

31:43.525 --> 31:45.150
We've been through all that, doctor.

31:45.319 --> 31:47.644
What's the point
of rehashing that subject?

31:47.821 --> 31:50.573
We can't get back.
Wasn't that clear to you?

31:50.741 --> 31:52.152
Yes, that was clear to me.

31:52.326 --> 31:53.489
Then perhaps you are too ill

31:53.661 --> 31:56.496
to understand
what "can't get back" means.

31:57.164 --> 31:59.287
I don't believe it, Spock.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.160
It's just not like you to give up trying.

32:04.046 --> 32:06.039
Then I'll repeat it for you.

32:06.632 --> 32:08.672
Get this through your head.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.760
We can't get back.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.507
That means we are trapped here,
in this planet's past, just as we are.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.807
And we'll stay here
for the rest of our lives.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.479
Now do you understand?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.106
Yes, I understand.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.609
I never thought I'd hear it,

32:30.324 --> 32:32.198
but I understand.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.820
You wanna stay here.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.071
As a matter of fact,
you are highly motivated

32:37.248 --> 32:39.454
to stay in this forsaken waste.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.377
The prospect appeared quite attractive
to you a moment ago.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.665
Now, you listen to me,
you pointed-eared Vulcan...

32:49.552 --> 32:51.212
I don't like that.

32:51.387 --> 32:54.388
I don't think I ever did,
and now I'm sure.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.429
What's happening to you, Spock?

32:58.603 --> 33:01.308
Nothing that shouldn't have happened
long ago.

33:23.420 --> 33:25.247
Long ago.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.756
Of course.

33:28.551 --> 33:30.709
Long ago.

33:44.943 --> 33:49.771
This is where it is.
I can't remember the exact spot.

34:09.635 --> 34:11.509
That's it.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.837
That is the portal.

34:16.475 --> 34:18.931
I cannot wait any longer.

34:46.757 --> 34:49.710
Spock? McCoy?

34:50.969 --> 34:53.674
- Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
- Scott here, captain.

34:53.847 --> 34:55.389
How much time
before the sun blows up?

34:55.558 --> 34:58.761
Seventeen minutes. You three
had better come back right away.

34:58.936 --> 35:00.976
We can't, Scotty.
Spock and McCoy are missing.

35:01.147 --> 35:03.899
I knew there was trouble.
I got a landing party standing by.

35:04.066 --> 35:06.984
No. Under no circumstances
send anyone else down here

35:07.153 --> 35:08.316
without my orders.

35:08.488 --> 35:11.654
Prepare to warp out and stand by.
Kirk out.

35:13.535 --> 35:15.361
Mr. Atoz.

35:15.745 --> 35:17.405
Where are you?

35:20.917 --> 35:23.159
May I help you? It's you.

35:23.336 --> 35:25.210
You're lucky you found your way
back here.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.207
Now, let me process you
through the atavachron.

35:27.382 --> 35:28.841
No.

35:29.384 --> 35:33.003
Mr. Atoz, my friends and I
are from another planet.

35:33.180 --> 35:36.549
We don't belong in your history.
We don't belong on your planet at all.

35:36.725 --> 35:39.643
Just let me take care of you
and get you back where you belong.

35:39.812 --> 35:41.271
No.

35:41.647 --> 35:45.645
I want to find the exact disc
that they were viewing.

35:45.818 --> 35:47.396
- Please, go back.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Atoz.

35:47.570 --> 35:50.856
- Mr. Atoz.
- Please. I must prepare to escape.

35:52.492 --> 35:53.654
I'll let you out in a minute.

35:55.536 --> 35:59.155
Still up to your little game of replicas?
Which are you this time, real or not?

36:05.839 --> 36:08.412
You are evidently a suicidal maniac.

36:08.592 --> 36:10.335
I don't understand
what you're trying to do,

36:10.552 --> 36:14.881
but if you continue, both of us will die,
and I, for one, do not wish death.

36:15.057 --> 36:17.345
If you help me, we won't die,
I promise you that.

36:17.518 --> 36:20.554
- I don't trust you.
- Are you the replica or the real one?

36:20.729 --> 36:24.098
I am the real Atoz.
You've done away with my replicas.

36:24.275 --> 36:27.608
I regret what I must now do.

36:28.612 --> 36:30.439
You don't really wanna hurt me,
do you?

36:31.240 --> 36:33.565
You've been trying to save my life,
I realise that.

36:33.743 --> 36:35.118
Put that thing away.

36:49.968 --> 36:52.126
I cannot pretend to be sorry
that you are here,

36:52.762 --> 36:55.432
though I realise
it is a misfortune for you.

36:56.058 --> 36:59.224
I'm here against my will too,
just as you are.

37:00.646 --> 37:02.354
I'm sorry.

37:03.190 --> 37:06.855
I know of no way
to return you to your own time.

37:07.027 --> 37:11.820
It's not that I wish to return.
This is my time now.

37:11.991 --> 37:15.609
I've had to face that,
but it has been lonely here.

37:17.455 --> 37:20.124
Do you know what it's like
to be alone?

37:20.291 --> 37:21.951
Really alone?

37:23.169 --> 37:24.628
Yes.

37:25.338 --> 37:26.998
I know what it is like.

37:28.466 --> 37:29.629
I believe you do.

37:34.514 --> 37:36.673
Have something to eat, please.

37:37.309 --> 37:39.432
If it pleases you.

37:47.694 --> 37:49.652
This is animal flesh?

37:49.822 --> 37:53.321
Well, there's not much else to eat
around here, I'm afraid.

37:53.492 --> 37:55.817
Naturally, because of the climate.

37:58.205 --> 38:00.578
What is the source of heat
in this shelter?

38:00.750 --> 38:02.410
There's an underground hot spring.

38:02.585 --> 38:08.540
Excellent. Then it will be possible
to build a greenhouse of sorts.

38:12.387 --> 38:15.803
Meanwhile, this will have to do
as the only source of nourishment.

38:34.493 --> 38:37.779
There aren't many luxuries
around here.

38:38.247 --> 38:41.082
Zor Kahn only left me
what was necessary to survive.

38:41.250 --> 38:44.167
But he evidently intended
that you continue living.

38:44.336 --> 38:45.747
Yes.

38:46.547 --> 38:50.924
He gave me weapons, a shelter,
food, everything I needed to live.

38:52.220 --> 38:54.093
Except companionship.

38:55.848 --> 38:58.885
He did not want it said
that he had me killed.

38:59.686 --> 39:01.809
But to send me here alone,

39:01.980 --> 39:04.732
if that is not death, what is?

39:06.943 --> 39:09.778
A very inventive mind, that man.

39:10.113 --> 39:11.940
But insensitive,

39:13.075 --> 39:15.233
to send such a beautiful woman
into exile.

39:18.539 --> 39:21.955
The cold must have affected me
more than I realised.

39:22.626 --> 39:25.082
Please, pay no attention.
I'm not myself.

39:26.714 --> 39:28.956
I'm behaving disgracefully.

39:29.425 --> 39:32.545
I have eaten animal flesh
and I've enjoyed it.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.963
What is wrong with me?

39:36.599 --> 39:38.971
I tell you you're beautiful.

39:42.563 --> 39:44.805
But you are beautiful.

39:47.110 --> 39:49.601
Is it so wrong to tell you so?

39:50.321 --> 39:52.895
I have longed to hear you say it.

40:41.583 --> 40:43.706
You are beautiful.

40:44.878 --> 40:48.247
More beautiful than any dream
of beauty I've ever known.

41:00.311 --> 41:04.178
Just stay where you are, sir.
I'll see you get to safety.

41:22.917 --> 41:24.709
Now, you're gonna help me
look for my friends.

41:24.878 --> 41:27.914
You're a most determined man.

41:31.551 --> 41:33.010
- Kirk here.
- What's happening?

41:33.178 --> 41:36.013
- Why are you waiting?
- No time to explain.

41:36.181 --> 41:38.257
- Are you ready to warp out?
- Aye, captain.

41:38.434 --> 41:40.142
Stand by to beam us up.

41:40.310 --> 41:45.732
But when that star explodes, don't wait.
Get out fast. Kirk out.

41:46.776 --> 41:48.768
Now we're gonna start looking.

41:48.944 --> 41:52.777
They were in a frozen waste.
I could hear the wind.

41:53.282 --> 41:55.571
All right. All right.

41:55.743 --> 42:01.034
It must be the Sarpeidon ice age,
5,000 years ago. Let me look.

42:01.207 --> 42:03.994
We'll both look, Mr. Atoz.

42:09.966 --> 42:11.508
Spock.

42:13.762 --> 42:15.470
You've been dishonest with me,
Spock,

42:16.223 --> 42:18.346
and that is also something new
for you.

42:18.517 --> 42:22.467
- I've given you the facts, doctor.
- The facts as you know them.

42:23.564 --> 42:25.473
Or did you just accept
Zarabeth's word

42:25.649 --> 42:27.938
because it's what you wanted
to believe?

42:28.110 --> 42:29.770
You were told the truth.

42:29.945 --> 42:32.816
If Zarabeth is the source,
what difference does it make?

42:32.990 --> 42:36.822
Zarabeth is a woman condemned
to a terrible life of loneliness.

42:36.994 --> 42:40.198
She would do anything to anybody
to change that.

42:40.373 --> 42:43.658
- Wouldn't you, Zarabeth?
- I told you what I know.

42:43.835 --> 42:44.997
Did you?

42:45.169 --> 42:50.164
You said we can't get back.
The truth is you can't get back.

42:50.842 --> 42:53.131
She would not jeopardise other lives.

42:53.303 --> 42:56.138
She would do anything
to prevent that life of loneliness.

42:56.306 --> 42:58.346
She would lie. She would cheat.

42:58.517 --> 43:00.059
She would even murder me,

43:00.227 --> 43:02.515
the captain,
the entire crew of the Enterprise,

43:03.188 --> 43:05.513
to keep you here with her.

43:07.526 --> 43:09.684
Go ahead, Zarabeth.

43:09.862 --> 43:12.020
Tell Spock the truth.

43:12.865 --> 43:14.407
Go ahead.

43:14.950 --> 43:16.409
Tell Spock you would kill.

43:16.577 --> 43:18.866
- What are you doing to her?
- Don't let him touch me.

43:23.125 --> 43:25.035
Are you trying to kill me, Spock?

43:29.215 --> 43:31.540
Is that what you really want?

43:32.844 --> 43:37.221
Think. What are you feeling?
Rage? Jealousy?

43:37.390 --> 43:40.142
Have you ever had those feelings
before?

43:41.978 --> 43:44.220
This is impossible.

43:44.815 --> 43:46.891
Impossible.

43:48.318 --> 43:49.812
I am a Vulcan.

43:49.987 --> 43:54.814
The Vulcan you knew won't exist
for another 5,000 years.

43:55.325 --> 43:56.488
Think, man.

43:56.660 --> 44:00.160
What's happening on your planet
right now at this very moment?

44:01.248 --> 44:03.953
My ancestors are barbarians.

44:04.502 --> 44:06.375
Warlike barbarians.

44:06.545 --> 44:10.757
Who nearly killed themselves off
with their own passions.

44:11.509 --> 44:13.087
Spock.

44:13.803 --> 44:16.721
You're reverting into your ancestors,

44:16.889 --> 44:20.472
5,000 years before you were born.

44:23.188 --> 44:25.145
I've lost myself.

44:27.525 --> 44:30.017
I do not know who I am.

44:48.756 --> 44:50.583
Can we go back?

44:54.428 --> 44:56.220
I don't know.

44:58.391 --> 45:01.974
I only know that I can't go back.

45:03.229 --> 45:05.138
I know I'm going to try, Spock,

45:06.649 --> 45:09.520
because my life is back there.

45:10.278 --> 45:12.437
And I want that life.

45:45.106 --> 45:47.015
- You think that's the right one?
- I don't know.

45:47.191 --> 45:49.480
If we're to get the portal set
for the proper time period,

45:49.652 --> 45:50.684
you must be specific.

45:50.862 --> 45:53.614
- I didn't see it.
- Well, try calling out.

45:54.157 --> 45:55.782
Bones.

45:56.701 --> 45:59.453
Spock. McCoy.

46:01.373 --> 46:04.042
- You've got the wrong one.
- Please, there's no time left.

46:04.209 --> 46:06.534
- Let me go.
- Try again.

46:12.342 --> 46:13.588
There's no portal, here, doctor.

46:13.761 --> 46:16.168
- It's hopeless.
- I suppose you're right.

46:16.347 --> 46:19.882
You're too ill to remain out here
any longer. Give it up.

46:27.859 --> 46:29.317
Bones.

46:29.610 --> 46:31.235
Spock.

46:31.696 --> 46:34.365
It's Jim. Here we are, Jim.

46:34.908 --> 46:36.450
We found them.

46:37.076 --> 46:40.362
- Can you still hear me?
- We hear you perfectly, captain.

46:42.290 --> 46:43.998
Follow my voice.

46:45.335 --> 46:48.253
Spock, McCoy, follow my voice.
Do you hear me?

46:48.422 --> 46:52.254
Keep following my voice.
Spock. McCoy.

46:52.426 --> 46:54.169
This must be it.

46:54.553 --> 46:55.881
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

47:02.770 --> 47:04.050
Come on, Spock.

47:05.564 --> 47:07.557
You start ahead, doctor.

47:10.528 --> 47:13.149
I do not wish to part from you.

47:13.322 --> 47:15.529
I cannot come.

47:15.867 --> 47:18.440
If I go back, I will die.

47:18.786 --> 47:19.949
What are you waiting for?

47:21.122 --> 47:22.949
How much time do we have?

47:24.709 --> 47:27.544
- Scotty, how much time is there?
- You've got to come aboard now.

47:30.215 --> 47:32.788
Come on, Spock, now.

47:43.103 --> 47:44.432
Something's wrong.

47:47.316 --> 47:49.273
- Why can't he get through?
- I don't know.

47:49.443 --> 47:53.358
Unless it's because they originally
went through the portal together.

47:53.531 --> 47:54.811
Spock, McCoy,

47:54.991 --> 47:58.490
you can't get through unless you both
come back at the same time.

47:58.870 --> 48:01.491
- Scotty.
- Orders or no, I'm beaming you up.

48:01.664 --> 48:03.573
No. Wait.

48:05.168 --> 48:07.042
Spock, McCoy,
hurry through the portal.

48:07.212 --> 48:09.085
Time is running out.

48:48.212 --> 48:51.048
He had his escape planned.
I'm glad he made it.

48:54.886 --> 48:56.629
Kirk to Enterprise.

48:58.932 --> 49:01.803
There's no further need to observe me,
doctor.

49:01.977 --> 49:05.476
As you can see, I've returned
to the present in every sense.

49:06.189 --> 49:07.814
But it did happen, Spock.

49:08.900 --> 49:10.858
Yes, it happened.

49:11.403 --> 49:14.190
But that was 5,000 years ago.

49:14.907 --> 49:18.905
And she is dead now.
Dead and buried.

49:19.620 --> 49:21.114
Long ago.

49:21.288 --> 49:23.577
- Scotty, are you there?
- It's now or never, captain.

49:23.749 --> 49:25.327
Beam us aboard.

49:25.501 --> 49:28.253
And go to maximum warp
as soon as we're there. Kirk out.
