00:55.305 --> 00:58.266
What? What is it?

01:00.435 --> 01:02.646
Stay here with your cell phone.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.246
Everything's okay.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.520
Was it one of those dreams?

01:47.733 --> 01:49.526
I'll fix you some hot tea.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.327
Are you mad at me?

01:59.161 --> 02:00.704
Mad at you?

02:01.705 --> 02:02.998
For what?

02:03.707 --> 02:05.292
For running away.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.429
I thought you'd understand the note.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.852
I... thought I'd be back in a few days.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.944
I...

02:32.027 --> 02:33.987
I forgot about the note.

02:53.131 --> 02:56.718
They're not like other dreams,
the premonitions.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.222
I wake up from them
with these nosebleeds.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.432
I've had them since I was a little girl.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.728
And I know... I know that it sounds nuts,

03:06.812 --> 03:10.023
but I feel that
something terrible is coming

03:10.107 --> 03:14.319
and-and if I can just solve the puzzle
of the premonition on time

03:14.403 --> 03:17.781
maybe I can... stop it from happening.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.409
Do you think I'm crazy?

03:23.662 --> 03:26.248
Where-Where did the dream take place?

03:26.331 --> 03:30.168
It's a big space.
The ceilings are really high.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.004
There's... a lot of glass.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.883
Kind of like
the space we're in now?

03:37.175 --> 03:40.220
No, the light's different and...

03:40.804 --> 03:43.473
there's a... clanking sound.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.309
Like a metallic... like silverware.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.394
Mmm-hmm.

03:49.479 --> 03:53.817
Uh, the moment that I catch it,
it just disappears.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.404
That's okay.
Sometimes it's best not to push.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.864
But I need to know.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.325
These, uh...

04:02.409 --> 04:05.537
These dreams occur
at important junctures in your life.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.039
You're gonna say that it's anxiety
or stress or--

04:08.123 --> 04:10.500
No, no, no.
Nothing so reductive.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.921
I'm just wondering if your subconscious
is trying to help you out.

04:16.548 --> 04:21.929
You're a small child, about to realize
your all-powerful father is in danger.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.265
Then you're 21, officially an adult.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.809
It seems these are junctures--

04:26.892 --> 04:29.227
-But the bus dream did come true.
-Sure.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.479
But what if psychic just means
your mind is able to pick up

04:31.563 --> 04:33.857
on even the subtlest cues
in the world around you?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.608
I don't understand.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.028
You're gathering information
the whole time.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.322
You don't realize it, but you are.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.782
I mean, even as a little girl.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.158
So...

04:43.241 --> 04:45.869
maybe your mind is picking up
on all these cues,

04:45.953 --> 04:49.039
and using these dreams to process them.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.625
So, it's the mission.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.421
I'm trying to prepare myself
for the mission.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.382
Could be.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.508
Or...

05:01.718 --> 05:04.221
maybe...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.598
You're talking to these boys.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.891
You're talking to me.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.686
Your parents are giving you
space to heal.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.355
It's another juncture.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.232
I think so.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.656
The first time, I ignored the instinct.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.827
I had the premonition,
but I didn't connect it to the bus.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.745
I was too young to understand.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.956
The second time,
I thought I solved the puzzle.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.001
I got all the way to New York City
and my father wasn't there.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.293
I... I got it wrong.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.587
Now, I'm having this new dream.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.174
I don't understand what it is,
I don't know what it means,

05:41.258 --> 05:43.593
and I don't know what to do.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.349
Maybe this time just accept it.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.602
Whatever happens, just claim it.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.814
I can't.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.733
-I feel like the pain is just too big.
-Hey.

05:58.816 --> 06:02.237
Hey, you know why we, uh...
why we like to be hugged?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.782
The way I see it,
it sets a limit on the pain.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.535
You know?
Puts a perimeter around it.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.625
How big can the pain be, really?

06:19.462 --> 06:20.505
Accept it?

06:24.676 --> 06:28.138
This is where I am now.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.185
<i>I wonder if he's</i>
<i>getting anywhere with her.</i>

06:33.268 --> 06:35.187
It's been over an hour.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.651
It's a nice place.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.320
You've never seen it?

06:43.403 --> 06:46.573
I usually drop her in the...
the parking lot by the cafÃ©.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.283
Well, you should walk her in.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.160
Yes, dear.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.122
Poor henpecked Abel.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.087
Did Prairie leave a note?

07:01.964 --> 07:05.425
When she disappeared,
was there any note?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.136
A note?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.389
No. What...?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.977
They're coming.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.521
Good to see you again, Mr. Johnson.

07:18.605 --> 07:22.067
You must be Mrs. Johnson.
Elias Rahim, nice to meet you.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.402
I suppose you know all about us.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.737
Oh, we're just getting started.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.450
Can we have a private word?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.911
I'm not sure that would be
such a good idea,

07:33.996 --> 07:37.832
but if it's okay with you,
we can all just talk now?

07:37.915 --> 07:39.376
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.924
I'm sure you heard
what happened last night.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.342
No, what happened?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.305
Prairie woke up screaming.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.476
She's had these night terrors
ever since she was a girl.

07:56.559 --> 08:00.938
Her nose bleeds and, um...
it's quite terrifying for her.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.691
Our family doctor, years ago,
prescribed medication--

08:03.775 --> 08:05.485
It didn't work.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.322
- It helped a little.
- Can I stop you for a moment?

08:10.156 --> 08:12.659
I'm not a pharmacologist
or doctor of any kind.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.619
I'm just a listener. I'm here to...

08:14.702 --> 08:17.747
help with the transition
as a victim specialist.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.417
Um... you guys are victims too.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.876
I mean, you've suffered tremendously.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.714
Just making it through the day right now,
it's a huge achievement for all of you.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.049
If I could suggest,

08:28.133 --> 08:30.927
it might be nice for you guys
to do something together.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.639
Something you might do if she were home
from school or back after a long trip.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.434
Something to help
normalize your family life.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.897
Thank you for that... for that advice.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.400
Maybe we'll try that.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.526
Take care.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.863
All the best. See you tomorrow, OA.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.356
Why stick around here
when you don't have to?

09:24.439 --> 09:25.940
Got my projects.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.692
Oh, yeah? Like what?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.110
I'm into parkour.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.282
You like computers?

09:34.949 --> 09:37.243
-You know, as a thing.
-"As a thing"?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.162
For a job and shit. You know.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.582
Guaranteed to make bank.
Always gonna be computers.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.128
Yeah... same, you know.

09:47.795 --> 09:51.258
Stunts and shit.
Maybe a personal trainer.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.343
Always gonna be movies and TV.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.678
People wanna look good naked.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.056
Right.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.059
Not bad for a couple of the dumb kids.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.316
Yo, can I see?

10:11.403 --> 10:12.570
Okay, whatever.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.370
<i>Here at the Alternative School,</i>

10:20.453 --> 10:22.914
<i>you can pick your subjects</i>
<i>and work at your own pace.</i>

10:22.997 --> 10:25.250
<i>Pretty neat. Shall we get started?</i>

10:25.333 --> 10:28.670
<i>Fuck me in the butt.</i>
<i>Fuck me in the butt.</i>

10:30.004 --> 10:32.590
<i>Fuck me in the butt.</i>
<i>Fuck me in the butt.</i>

10:32.674 --> 10:34.091
<i>Great job!</i>

10:34.176 --> 10:37.512
<i>Click the button at the bottom</i>
<i>of the page to see how you did.</i>

10:44.227 --> 10:45.687
I like your laugh.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.568
If I laugh again,
'cause that's so fucking corny,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.486
do I get another kiss?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.282
Let me see some more of your shit first.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.869
Are you gonna dump pig's blood
on my head at prom?

11:03.205 --> 11:05.122
Not unless you think that's hot.

11:08.251 --> 11:11.087
You remember that STD assembly
Gilchrist did last fall?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.727
Hey, yo, wait up!

11:25.810 --> 11:28.479
- Hey, Steve.
- Sorry I'm late.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.482
You're not late.
We haven't even gotten to the house yet.

11:31.566 --> 11:32.734
Right.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.986
Yo, where'd you get that protein bar?
I'm starving.

11:35.069 --> 11:38.531
You know that feeling in winter,
when you can, like, always eat something?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.408
Is that 'cause, like,
eating creates warmth?

11:40.492 --> 11:42.118
Uh, I got it from French.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.121
That was my last one.

11:46.164 --> 11:49.459
-Oh, that's cool, I'm good.
-I can split it with you, if you want.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.128
- Thanks, Buck.
- Oh. God.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.548
Okay.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.094
- Oh. My bad.
- Come on.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.098
Hey, BBA!

12:04.182 --> 12:06.059
- Oh, thank you.
- Come on!

12:06.142 --> 12:07.310
You're the best.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.656
Were you just tickled or something?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.325
- What?
- Were you just tickled?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.744
Yeah, or, like,
force-fed a bunch of candy?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.163
Steve was just with a girl.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.289
Jesse, shut up.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.750
Is it Kathy with a K? I like her.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.336
Oh, which one's Kathy with a K?
Is she a senior?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.504
No, she's a junior.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.714
She's cute.
Has kind of a baby nose.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.092
A baby nose? Is that a thing?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.510
I hate all of you.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.145
Steve, you wanna start us off?

12:55.358 --> 12:56.943
You wanna take us through
the second movement?

12:57.026 --> 12:58.027
Homer's movement?

12:59.821 --> 13:00.822
Uh...

13:00.905 --> 13:02.990
Has everyone stretched a little?

13:03.074 --> 13:05.201
All right, everybody take
a deep breath in...

13:06.953 --> 13:09.038
...and then go and fuck yourselves.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.708
All right, uh...

13:11.791 --> 13:14.836
Homer's movement, the second,
but really slow to start.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.345
On this one,
is it a breath in or a breath out?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.096
Start here.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.098
No, you, uh...

13:27.181 --> 13:31.102
you gotta keep your wrists, like,
just a little tighter, you know?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.771
Yeah, I don't know. I can't do that.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.022
Try like...

13:35.106 --> 13:38.901
Like you've got rope around your wrists
and you wanna, like, break it, you know?

13:43.906 --> 13:46.284
Sometimes you just gotta
tell yourself it's easy

13:46.368 --> 13:47.702
and then it'll feel easy.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.786
You know?

13:48.870 --> 13:52.623
Yeah, like forcing yourself to smile
until you feel happy.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.172
Now keep repeating it over and over.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.591
Think about how long
Homer and OA did it for.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.959
Hey, you join a sports team?

14:37.502 --> 14:40.630
No, I just played a game
of pickup basketball with some friends.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.925
Well, I've been on the phone
all afternoon.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.470
-Oh, yeah?
-Had to shell out $5,000 to the Brekovs.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.182
Rebecca Brekov was screaming
bloody murder at me for two goddamn hours.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.060
She had no idea
how her son hurt his throat

14:54.143 --> 14:56.729
until she saw some subtweet online

14:56.813 --> 14:59.774
and Miles finally admitted
that you punched him.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.236
If I didn't offer to pay
their medical deductible,

15:03.319 --> 15:05.822
she was gonna call the police and sue us.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.035
All right, let me take a shower.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.830
I'll get my thoughts in order
and then we can talk this out, all right?

15:13.913 --> 15:17.291
I'll... I'll sit down with you and...
we can figure something out.

15:19.168 --> 15:23.047
I messed up, all right?
Look, I'll be back down.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.181
I fucked up.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.767
I messed up.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.229
I was... I was jealous.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.982
Angry. Felt like shit.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.567
I wanted to hurt someone.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.528
I fucked up.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.157
I've just been
driving around with the check.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.993
I don't want to cash it. I...

15:52.452 --> 15:53.828
I mean, it's so strange.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.039
It would make more sense if my brother
had written it, but he didn't.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.541
The lawyer did.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.088
Yeah, but the check
feels like a piece of Theo.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.965
It makes sense.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.174
Yeah.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.762
What are you gonna do with it?

16:10.845 --> 16:12.763
Oh, I need new appliances.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.682
My fridge is ten years old.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.728
Maybe I'll buy one of those TVs
connected to the Internet.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.688
I don't know. I...

16:20.771 --> 16:23.232
I hate to let go of the check.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.779
I mean, it's the piece of paper,
not the money. I...

16:32.659 --> 16:33.868
You know, when I was little,

16:33.951 --> 16:36.621
Nancy and Abel took me
to the Natural History Museum,

16:36.704 --> 16:39.624
to this exhibit on totems.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.378
There was an audio tour. I loved it.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.964
I made them take me back twice.

16:47.507 --> 16:52.428
And it was all about how cultures
that have survived more loss,

16:52.512 --> 16:56.140
like harsh weather or earthquakes,

16:56.224 --> 16:58.100
they have more totems.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.896
Objects carry meaning in difficult times.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.942
Um...

17:07.068 --> 17:12.239
In your place you went, in your NDE,
do you think that was purgatory?

17:13.658 --> 17:16.285
I believe in heaven, in angels.

17:17.745 --> 17:22.458
But I was thinking about it last night
as I was falling asleep, the darkness.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.879
I don't think it was purgatory, but...

17:27.880 --> 17:30.007
I don't think we can understand, you know?

17:30.091 --> 17:33.010
I know, why do we
always try to understand?

17:34.011 --> 17:39.016
The future is dark.
Not dark, like, bad. Just dark.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.686
You can't see it.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.271
And maybe living is just...

17:44.355 --> 17:46.357
bringing light to what you need in a day.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.900
-Just...
-Mmm.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.777
...seeing the day.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.698
Or at least that's what
I'm learning in therapy.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.159
You tell him things?
The therapist?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.452
Yeah.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.585
It feels good...
not to have to carry it all the time.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.878
Yeah. Yeah.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.883
So, um...

18:13.968 --> 18:15.762
Will this be dangerous?

18:16.888 --> 18:17.930
What do you mean?

18:18.014 --> 18:20.767
I mean, when we take you to Homer...

18:20.850 --> 18:22.018
I mean, what will happen?

18:22.101 --> 18:24.520
Will we... will we travel too?

18:24.604 --> 18:28.399
I don't know that I'm ready to go
to another dimension.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.192
Oh, I don't think it's like that.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.443
I think it's...

18:32.486 --> 18:35.531
The force of the movements,
done with perfect feeling,

18:35.615 --> 18:38.200
just opens something that's already here.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.453
Like an invisible river
that carries you away.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.000
But you have to jump in.
You have to want to jump in.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.086
Where will it take you?

18:50.379 --> 18:51.839
I don't know.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.843
-The future is--
-Dark.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.679
Yeah.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.481
I was stupid.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.568
I'm trying to take responsibility.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.946
I'll pay it back, I promise.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.590
Let's go. We're on a schedule.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.945
- Stop! Stop!
- Put me down! Put me down!

19:58.740 --> 20:00.366
Stop! Relax.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.244
Go. Get in.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.704
You got him? Get in.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.448
Principal Gilchrist, I told you already,

20:40.531 --> 20:42.074
you shouldn't have called his parents.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.077
They turned around and called Asheville.
You should have stayed out of it.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.996
I... I mean, I just don't understand

20:47.079 --> 20:49.248
why you would put this boy
through more heartache.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.667
<i>Like I'm not</i>
<i>supposed to not tell a parent</i>

20:51.751 --> 20:54.628
<i>when we learn of a kid's misconduct</i>
<i>through social media?</i>

20:54.712 --> 20:59.300
I just think it's an extremely rash and,
frankly, unprofessional reaction

20:59.383 --> 21:00.760
to a troubled boy.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.512
<i>He broke a kid's throat, Betty.</i>

21:03.595 --> 21:05.056
That was before.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.307
<i>Before what?</i>

21:06.390 --> 21:08.225
That was before we met at the house.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.518
<i>-What?</i>
-I mean...

21:10.519 --> 21:11.729
That was before...

21:11.813 --> 21:14.481
-I... I mean...
<i>-Before what, Betty?</i>

21:14.565 --> 21:17.777
I gotta go. I... I'm eating a sandwich.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.906
<i>-You're eating a what? A sandwich?</i>
-Yeah, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.033
-I gotta go, Principal Gilchrist.
<i>-Betty?</i>

21:25.409 --> 21:26.285
<i>Betty?</i>

21:26.368 --> 21:28.412
It's... it's BBA.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.581
<i>- Uh, what?</i>

21:39.799 --> 21:42.134
Table for three. Johnson.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.269
I think I'm just going to get
what I always do.

21:52.353 --> 21:54.480
-Shrimp Alfredo?
-Yep.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.398
Prairie, you having your usual?

21:56.482 --> 21:57.399
Usual?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.153
-Five cheese--
-Oh, the ziti?

22:01.778 --> 22:03.364
Yeah, I'll get that.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.992
I think I'm gonna try
the stuffed mushrooms.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.618
That sounds good.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.621
You know, I think Byron got that once.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.623
What?

22:12.706 --> 22:14.333
What? Byron was a good kid.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.044
How could you possibly remember
what he ordered?

22:17.128 --> 22:18.337
I remember it.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.882
I remember it
because he called 'em "shrooms."

22:22.299 --> 22:23.675
Come on, he was nice.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.761
I said he was a good kid.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.971
Byron.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.265
Not like the kid had ever tried
a drug in his life.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.808
-Abel.
-I can tell you, that's entirely true.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.394
How long did you two date?

22:33.477 --> 22:36.230
Oh, I don't know.
Four months or something?

22:36.313 --> 22:37.689
I don't think he liked me.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.650
He liked you.
Of course he liked you.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.903
I mean, maybe he liked
that I couldn't see him.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.866
Well, he wasn't winning any awards
in the looks department.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.576
He had that...

22:49.660 --> 22:51.662
- that funny little moustache thing.
- The moustache.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.705
He had a nice personality.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.083
He brought me flowers
from his little garden on Mother's Day.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.293
That was nice.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.129
It was nice that you invited him
to family dinner.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.214
Well, he was your boyfriend.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.258
You should friend Byron on Facebook.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.260
See what he looks like now.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.220
She doesn't have a Facebook.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.807
Hi, sorry, um,
you're the Michigan Miracle, right?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.475
Prairie Johnson?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.603
-Oh, uh...
-Can I take a picture with you?

23:16.687 --> 23:17.646
Why?

23:17.729 --> 23:20.149
- She was blind.
- We're having dinner.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.442
-It'll just take a second.
-Nance--

23:21.525 --> 23:22.944
-Well, we are.
-Thank you.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.697
Sorry.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.907
Um... you're such an inspiration, really.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.617
I mean...

23:30.701 --> 23:33.620
to be beaten like that and raped.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.206
I can't even imagine.

23:35.289 --> 23:38.542
You look so pretty in person.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.338
Uh... thanks.

23:46.968 --> 23:48.719
I'm gonna go back there
and make her delete it.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.388
Nancy, let's just have a good time.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.226
Where's she coming from,
thinking she can just...

23:55.309 --> 23:57.603
Like she knows something about our lives.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.895
- She doesn't know anything.
- Exactly.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.482
-She said that she was beaten and--
-I know. Some people--

24:01.565 --> 24:03.567
- It's just a picture.
- It is not okay.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.403
-Waitress?
-Do you look like you've got bruises?

24:06.487 --> 24:07.696
Do you look like you've been beaten?

24:07.779 --> 24:08.822
- Excuse me.
- Shh.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.199
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

24:10.282 --> 24:13.285
- Uh, could we have one of those?
- Yes.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.126
Could we have some water, please?

24:20.209 --> 24:22.003
Uh, sure, of course.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.979
If you kick anything,
I will fucking end you.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.564
I'm tired.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.275
Good.

24:46.027 --> 24:49.238
Why don't you, uh,
go pick out a drink. One.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.574
Can I help you?

25:07.423 --> 25:10.467
That's, uh, a unique name.
How do you say that?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.054
Mickey.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.806
- Guy's name.
- My name's actually McKayla.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.016
Steven.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.144
- What are you--
- I followed you.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.521
Thank fucking God, BBA, I'm freaked.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.066
-I'm fucking freaked.
-I know, sweetie, I know.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.116
I'm gone. I'm outta here.

25:34.199 --> 25:37.202
Not if you listen to me
closely, Steven, okay?

25:37.286 --> 25:40.247
You're going to say
you have to go to the bathroom.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.416
I put an out of order sign on it.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.795
Say you have to go bad and you have to go
to the side of the road. I'll be nearby.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.755
You say that they're molesting you.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.967
And you have to shout that no matter
how embarrassing that sounds.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.927
-Okay, Steven?
-Are you fucking insane?

25:54.011 --> 25:55.971
Just listen.
You say they're molesting you.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.974
Then I'll back it up.
'Cause I'm just an onlooker.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.018
They beat the shit out of me
in front of my own parents

26:01.101 --> 26:02.644
and they stood there
like I'm some rabid dog.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.272
I know, Steven. I know. I know.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.900
Do you get the plan?

26:08.984 --> 26:10.486
Yeah.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.489
Yeah, I say they're touching my dick
and you come and get me.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.533
-Oh, don't say it like that.
-What? Why?

26:16.617 --> 26:19.161
Because it sounds like it's your fantasy
and you're making it up.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.037
-A dude?
-People are gay, Steven.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.791
I know people are gay.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.335
Okay, well, we can't look like
we know each other.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.794
And what if it doesn't work?

26:27.878 --> 26:29.255
Steven.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.839
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.023
-Yo, I gotta piss.
-What?

26:48.106 --> 26:49.441
I gotta piss.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.901
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

26:50.984 --> 26:52.944
Uh, there was an out of order sign.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.239
-Are you fucking with me, you little rat?
-Please.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.323
For Christ's sakes, man,

26:56.407 --> 26:58.617
you're gonna have to take him
behind the fucking soda machine.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.952
Hurry up.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.078
Hurry up.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.665
- Come on.
- We're late.

27:14.258 --> 27:15.676
All right...

27:33.986 --> 27:37.489
That man is molesting that boy! He's...

27:38.199 --> 27:39.366
He...

27:39.449 --> 27:42.077
He's molesting him.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.288
Stop it. Stop what you're doing.
Stop molesting him!

27:44.371 --> 27:47.249
-What the fuck, lady? I wasn't doing shit.
-I saw you!

27:47.332 --> 27:49.751
- You're out of your mind.
- The fuck's going on?

27:49.835 --> 27:52.254
-Just get in the fucking van.
-You can't just get away with that.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.465
That man is molesting that boy!

27:54.548 --> 27:56.842
I saw you. I'm calling the police!

27:56.925 --> 27:58.385
I have your plate numbers!

27:58.468 --> 28:02.222
-Who the fuck is she, bro? You hit her?
-No, man, she's fuckin' insane.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.516
Lady, we've got papers signed
by that kid's parents, all right?

28:04.600 --> 28:05.601
We're a reform school.

28:05.684 --> 28:10.063
Well, the last I checked,
molestation is illegal in all 50 states.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.275
You were ten feet away.
What the fuck do you think you saw, lady?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.611
She's nutso. You're fucking nutso.
We have a job to do.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.238
- Get out of here.
- Get in the fucking van.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.200
Get in there.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.831
Back the fuck up
or we'll run you over.

28:27.914 --> 28:31.001
No. No. Stop! Stop!

28:31.084 --> 28:33.337
- She's fucking bat-shit crazy.
- Stop! Stop!

28:33.420 --> 28:34.630
Stop, please!

28:36.798 --> 28:39.259
I know. I know. I know.
I know. I know.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.678
Stop, I have something!
I have something!

28:43.639 --> 28:44.973
I have something you'll want.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.018
- What do you have?
- Okay. Okay. There's...

28:52.314 --> 28:54.775
- It's $50,000.
- What?

28:54.858 --> 28:57.569
-$50,000.
-It's $50,000.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.863
A cashier's check. I'll give it to you.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.907
$50,000.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.497
Let me see that.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.880
- Is this real?
- Just let him go. Yes.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.424
- Look at this.
- $50,000?

29:22.636 --> 29:23.762
Get out.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.945
I'm gonna make her
delete the picture.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.112
Nancy.

29:41.196 --> 29:44.449
-She could put it online.
-Nance, drop it.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.993
Abel, it's her face.

29:47.911 --> 29:51.790
She could put it online for...
for everyone to see.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.209
-Saying that you were--
-Nancy.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.796
What? What?
I'm being crazy?

29:57.879 --> 29:59.089
I'm being the crazy one?

29:59.172 --> 30:02.509
'Cause I don't want that
stupid girl to have our daughter's picture

30:02.593 --> 30:04.345
to do anything she wants with it?

30:06.179 --> 30:09.474
Is that... Is that what you want?

30:09.558 --> 30:13.812
Do you want your picture online
for all the world to see?

30:14.479 --> 30:15.856
I don't... I don't know.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.610
-She just came over suddenly--
-No. No, really, tell me.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.738
Do you want everyone to see that?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.532
To imagine anything they want?

30:25.615 --> 30:29.328
Imagine all the ways
that you were abused,

30:29.411 --> 30:32.998
beaten, hurt, starved?

30:33.081 --> 30:36.710
To let...
to let their imaginations run wild?

30:36.793 --> 30:41.089
People-People-People getting off on this.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.050
Showing their friends. Thinking they know.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.552
Thinking they know everything about you.

30:45.635 --> 30:48.472
I don't even know. I don't know anything.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.306
I don't know anything!

30:50.391 --> 30:54.310
Were you in a house? Were you outside?
I don't know anything!

30:54.394 --> 30:56.688
Mom. Mom, it's okay.

30:56.772 --> 31:01.026
Why do you smell like that?
Is that him? Do you smell like him?

31:01.109 --> 31:03.445
Nance, we have to...

31:03.528 --> 31:06.656
What are these? Who did that to you?

31:08.784 --> 31:09.826
I did.

31:10.994 --> 31:11.995
I did.

31:13.079 --> 31:18.794
They are two notations of the five
movements to open another dimension.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.838
I know, because I am the Original Angel.

31:36.687 --> 31:39.022
You need to get out of here, OA?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.652
- Come on.
- What is...

31:44.319 --> 31:47.072
Prairie. Prairie.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.366
Prairie? Prairie!

32:31.700 --> 32:34.327
Every night you've told us
about your life.

32:37.789 --> 32:41.960
What shaped you, what frightened you...

32:44.671 --> 32:47.007
what brought you back here to Crestwood.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.765
You told us about your father in Russia.

32:56.182 --> 32:59.936
About living on a gated place on the hill.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.779
You told us about being sent away
from the person you loved.

33:11.948 --> 33:14.910
You told us about the feeling you had...

33:16.369 --> 33:19.790
when you realized
he wasn't at the Statue of Liberty.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.296
And the feeling of relief when Hap was.

33:29.257 --> 33:33.261
About how, at first, he felt like
the father figure you were looking for.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.680
You know?

33:35.722 --> 33:38.433
Strong, smart...

33:39.768 --> 33:41.477
uncompromised.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.025
And how you followed him into the dark.

33:49.695 --> 33:53.615
Into the basement where you would
create a new family.

33:55.491 --> 33:59.830
Scott, Rachel, Homer...

34:01.289 --> 34:02.916
and even Renata.

34:04.585 --> 34:07.671
And how with that family,
you found insight.

34:09.464 --> 34:12.217
A way to find the light within the dark.

34:14.595 --> 34:18.599
And... we know we're taking their place.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.062
But, in all of that...

34:28.316 --> 34:30.902
...you never really told us about them.

34:32.613 --> 34:34.030
Them?

34:35.406 --> 34:37.492
They rescued you from a hard life.

34:38.785 --> 34:39.953
They raised you.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.875
I mean, you think you're here
because of us, and...

34:44.958 --> 34:46.251
in a way you are.

34:48.003 --> 34:51.464
-But you're also here because of them.
-They medicated me.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.802
-I know.
-They thought I was crazy.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.596
They're not my parents.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.769
But they are your parents.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.480
You could have stayed with Khatun.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.650
With your father. But...

35:11.652 --> 35:13.319
you chose to come back.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.655
I didn't choose to come to Crestwood.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.867
Well, maybe you did.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.414
Maybe this is the missing piece.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.521
OA! Where are you?

35:53.609 --> 35:54.736
OA!

36:03.453 --> 36:05.246
Where is she?

36:05.330 --> 36:07.248
I don't know,
there's no one here.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.668
-Where's the rest of them?
-I have no idea, man.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.421
Steve. What's happening?

36:13.504 --> 36:15.882
My parents had me fucking kidnapped
by those goons.

36:17.592 --> 36:18.969
Okay. Calm down.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.261
Fuck being calm!

36:20.345 --> 36:21.805
And fuck your bullshit.

36:23.348 --> 36:24.557
Calm down.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.687
You're just like all the rest of them.
You don't give a fuck.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.566
We're just your slave labor so you can
leave us for your fucking boyfriend.

36:33.649 --> 36:35.777
We're just a retarded pit stop for you.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.112
Don't fucking touch me, bitch.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.680
You saw me do some fucking flips
and thought, "This guy"?

37:04.764 --> 37:06.891
No. No.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.559
No!

37:17.986 --> 37:19.195
What?

37:32.625 --> 37:34.085
Why?

37:40.926 --> 37:42.427
How...

37:44.930 --> 37:47.682
How did you survive so long down there?

37:53.897 --> 37:56.775
I survived because I wasn't alone.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.718
Tonight, I will finish telling my story.

38:27.097 --> 38:28.639
Are you ready?
