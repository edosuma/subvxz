00:06.340 --> 00:07.780
'Sherlock!'

00:16.059 --> 00:17.899
'It's a trick.'

00:17.900 --> 00:20.059
Just a magic trick.

00:20.060 --> 00:23.499
No. All right, stop it now.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.420
'Now, stay exactly where you are.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.260
'Don't move.' All right.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.740
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.819
'Please, would you do this for me?'

00:35.820 --> 00:37.659
Do what?

00:37.660 --> 00:39.340
'This phone call, it's er...'

00:40.740 --> 00:41.900
it's my note.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.779
It's what people do, don't they?

00:48.780 --> 00:50.780
'Leave a note.'

00:51.980 --> 00:54.219
Leave a note when?

00:54.220 --> 00:55.299
'Goodbye, John.'

00:55.300 --> 00:57.020
No. Don't...

01:13.620 --> 01:14.740
Sherlock!

02:20.700 --> 02:22.059
John.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.739
John, look at me. Look at me.

02:23.740 --> 02:24.940
And sleep.

02:26.060 --> 02:30.300
Right the way down, right the way
deep, right the way, sound asleep.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.299
That's real.

02:33.300 --> 02:36.339
That's good, with my voice just
there in the centre of your head

02:36.340 --> 02:38.979
and floating all the way around you.

02:38.980 --> 02:42.700
And you will awaken in three,
two, one...

02:43.900 --> 02:45.060
zero.

02:54.620 --> 02:57.620
Let me come through please!
He's my friend.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.179
'Bollocks!'

03:19.180 --> 03:20.899
No, no, no, no, it's obvious.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.539
That's how he did it. It's obvious.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.419
Derren Brown?!
Let it go, Sherlock's dead.

03:27.420 --> 03:28.779
But is he?

03:28.780 --> 03:30.459
There was a body, it was him.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.859
It was definitely him,
Molly Hooper laid him out.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.139
No, she's lying.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.979
It was Jim Moriarty's body
with a mask on.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.619
A mask?

03:38.620 --> 03:41.459
A bungee rope, a mask,
Derren Brown.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.579
Two years and the theories
keep getting more stupid.

03:43.580 --> 03:46.059
How many more have you got
for me today?

03:46.060 --> 03:48.259
Well, you know the paving slabs
in that whole area,

03:48.260 --> 03:49.899
even the exact ones
that he landed on,

03:49.900 --> 03:52.539
you know they were all... Guilt!

03:52.540 --> 03:54.299
That's all this is.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.099
You pushed us all into thinking

03:56.100 --> 03:58.859
that Sherlock that was a fraud,
you and Donovan.

03:58.860 --> 04:02.739
You did this and it killed him
and he's staying dead.

04:02.740 --> 04:05.699
Do you honestly believe that
if you have enough stupid theories,

04:05.700 --> 04:07.900
it's going to change
what really happened?

04:09.140 --> 04:10.699
I believe in Sherlock Holmes.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.699
Yeah, well,
that won't bring him back.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.139
And that after extensive
police investigations...

04:16.140 --> 04:19.619
Richard Brook did indeed prove to be
the creation of James Moriarty...

04:19.620 --> 04:22.859
'Amidst unprecedented
scenes, there was uproar in court

04:22.860 --> 04:26.339
'as Sherlock Holmes was vindicated
and cleared of all suspicion.'

04:26.340 --> 04:29.339
'Sadly, all this
comes too late for the detective,

04:29.340 --> 04:31.539
'who became something of a celebrity
two years ago.'

04:31.540 --> 04:35.619
Questions are now being asked as to
why police let matters get so far.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.579
Sherlock Holmes fell to his death

04:37.580 --> 04:40.459
from the top of London's Bart's
Hospital. Although he left no note,

04:40.460 --> 04:42.979
friends say it's unlikely
he was able to cope with the...

04:42.980 --> 04:46.060
Well then. Absent friends.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.539
Sherlock.

04:48.540 --> 04:50.059
Sherlock.

04:50.060 --> 04:51.700
And may God rest his soul.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.620
TRANSLATED FROM SERBIAN:

07:24.700 --> 07:25.700
What?

08:15.860 --> 08:17.099
Now listen to me.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.979
There's an underground terrorist
network active in London

08:19.980 --> 08:22.379
and a massive attack is imminent.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.180
Sorry, but the holiday is over...

08:26.260 --> 08:28.299
Brother dear.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.700
Back to Baker Street...

08:31.620 --> 08:32.980
Sherlock Holmes.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.260
Penny for the guy?

10:07.620 --> 10:09.339
Oi, mate, penny for the guy?

10:09.340 --> 10:12.180
Penny for the guy, mate?
Penny for the guy?

10:15.060 --> 10:17.740
Penny for the guy?
Penny for the guy?

10:28.820 --> 10:32.539
'That was the most ridiculous
thing I've ever done.'

10:32.540 --> 10:35.060
'You invaded Afghanistan.'

10:47.900 --> 10:50.619
You have been busy, haven't you?

10:50.620 --> 10:54.259
Quite the busy little bee. Hmm.

10:54.260 --> 10:58.179
Moriarty's network.
Took me two years to dismantle it.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.419
And you're confident you have?

11:00.420 --> 11:02.979
The Serbian side was the last piece
of the puzzle.

11:02.980 --> 11:08.859
Yes. You got yourself in deep there
with Baron Maupertuis.

11:08.860 --> 11:12.059
Quite a scheme. Colossal.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.899
Anyway. You're safe now.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.580
Mmm.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.259
A small "thank you"
wouldn't go amiss.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.459
What for?

11:21.460 --> 11:22.979
For wading in.

11:22.980 --> 11:27.020
In case you've forgotten,
field work is not my natural milieu.

11:28.660 --> 11:30.539
"Wading in?"

11:30.540 --> 11:33.179
You sat there and watched me
being beaten a pulp.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.499
I got you out. No, I got me out.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.139
Why didn't you intervene sooner?

11:37.140 --> 11:38.939
I couldn't risk giving
myself away, could I?

11:38.940 --> 11:41.659
It would have ruined everything.
You were enjoying it. Nonsense.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.219
Definitely enjoying it.

11:43.220 --> 11:46.099
Listen, do you have any idea
what it was like, Sherlock,

11:46.100 --> 11:48.499
going undercover?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.019
Smuggling my way
into their ranks like that?

11:51.020 --> 11:53.500
The noise, the people!

11:54.900 --> 11:56.699
I didn't know you spoke Serbian.

11:56.700 --> 12:00.619
I didn't.
But the language has a Slavic root.

12:00.620 --> 12:04.459
Frequent Turkish
and German loan words.

12:04.460 --> 12:05.939
Took me a couple of hours.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.819
Hmm, you're slipping.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.979
Middle-age, brother mine.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.740
Comes to us all.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.020
Oh, no, you don't take it, do you?

12:28.300 --> 12:31.819
No. You forget
a little thing like that.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.219
Yes.

12:33.220 --> 12:37.740
You forget lots of little things,
it seeMs..

12:38.740 --> 12:40.579
Uh-huh.

12:40.580 --> 12:42.019
Not sure about that.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.659
Hmm? Ages you.

12:43.660 --> 12:45.099
Just trying it out.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.380
Well, it ages you.

12:50.180 --> 12:53.219
Look... I'm not your mother,
I've no right to expect it...

12:53.220 --> 12:56.379
No... But just one phone call, John!

12:56.380 --> 12:58.859
Just one phone call would have done.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.539
I know.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.940
After all we went through!
Yes.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.100
I am sorry.

13:08.500 --> 13:12.740
Look, I understand how difficult
it was for you after...

13:13.780 --> 13:15.379
after...

13:15.380 --> 13:18.900
I just let it slide, Mr.s Hudson,
I let it all slide.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.060
And it just got harder and harder
to pick up the phone, somehow.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.460
Do you know what I mean?

13:35.900 --> 13:38.699
I need you to give this matter
your full attention, Sherlock,

13:38.700 --> 13:41.459
is that quite clear? What do you
think of this shirt? Sherlock!

13:41.460 --> 13:44.340
I will find your underground
terror cell, Mycroft.

13:45.460 --> 13:46.819
Just put me back in London.

13:46.820 --> 13:49.819
I need to get to know the place
again, breathe it in.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.539
Feel every quiver
of its beating heart.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.699
One of our men died
getting this information.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.059
All the chatter,
all the traffic concurs,

13:58.060 --> 14:00.979
there's going to be a terrorist
strike on London, a big one.

14:00.980 --> 14:02.899
And what about John Watson?

14:02.900 --> 14:05.579
John? Mm. Have you seen him?
Oh, yes,

14:05.580 --> 14:07.860
we meet up every Friday
for fish and chips(!)

14:10.540 --> 14:12.819
I've kept a weather eye on him,
of course.

14:12.820 --> 14:16.659
We haven't been in touch at all
to... prepare him.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.459
No.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.619
Well, we'll have to get rid of that.

14:20.620 --> 14:21.819
"We?" He looks ancient.

14:21.820 --> 14:24.420
I can't be seen to be wandering
around with an old man.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.100
I couldn't face letting it out.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.099
He never liked me dusting.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.259
No, I know.

14:52.260 --> 14:54.580
So why now? What changed your mind?

14:57.260 --> 15:00.139
Well, I've got some news.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.619
Oh, God, is it serious?

15:02.620 --> 15:04.979
What? No, no, I'm not ill.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.340
I've, well, I'm...

15:07.700 --> 15:09.299
moving on.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.020
You're emigrating?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.300
Nope. Er, no, I've er...

15:15.380 --> 15:16.819
I have met someone.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.779
Oh! Ah, lovely.

15:19.780 --> 15:22.619
Yeah. We're getting married.
Well, I'm going to ask, anyway.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.060
So soon after Sherlock?

15:25.340 --> 15:26.500
Hmm, well, yes.

15:27.820 --> 15:29.179
What's his name?

15:29.180 --> 15:30.459
It's a woman.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.940
A woman?! Yes, of course
it's a woman.

15:34.460 --> 15:37.699
You really have moved on, haven't
you? Mr.s Hudson, how many times?

15:37.700 --> 15:40.019
Sherlock was not my boyfriend!

15:40.020 --> 15:42.659
Live and let live, that's my motto.

15:42.660 --> 15:45.860
Listen to me - I am not gay!

15:47.060 --> 15:50.179
I think I'll surprise John.
He'll be delighted.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.180
You think so?

15:51.181 --> 15:54.099
Mm, pop into Baker Street,
who knows, jump out of a cake.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.620
Baker Street?
He isn't there any more.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.899
Why would he be?
It's been two years.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.740
He's got on with his life.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.580
What life? I've been away.

16:05.780 --> 16:09.179
Where's he going to be tonight?
How would I know? You always know.

16:09.180 --> 16:12.659
He has a dinner reservation
in the Marylebone Road.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.259
Nice little spot.

16:14.260 --> 16:17.419
They have a few bottles
of the 2000 Saint-Emilion,

16:17.420 --> 16:20.259
though I prefer the 2001.

16:20.260 --> 16:23.219
I think maybe I'll just Dr.op by.

16:23.220 --> 16:26.459
You know, it is just possible
that you won't be welcome.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.899
No, it isn't.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.620
Now, where is it?
Where's what? You know what.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.899
Welcome back, Mr. Holmes.

16:39.900 --> 16:40.940
Thank you.

16:42.020 --> 16:43.180
Blud.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.380
Sir, can I help you?

17:18.180 --> 17:21.980
Your wife just texted you, possibly
her contractions have started.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.340
Excuse me, sir.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.259
Oh, sir, I am so, so sorry.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.860
Er, please, let me just go to the
kitchen and Dr.y that off for you.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.340
Finished with that, sir?
Allow me to take it for you.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.740
Madam, can I suggest you look at this
menu, it's completely identical.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.299
Can I
help you with anything, sir?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.859
Hi, yeah, I'm looking for a bottle
of champagne. A good one.

18:22.860 --> 18:23.939
Hmm, well, these are all

18:23.940 --> 18:25.139
excellent vintages, sir.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.419
Oh, it's not really my area,

18:26.420 --> 18:27.459
what do you suggest?

18:27.460 --> 18:29.099
Well, you cannot possibly go wrong,

18:29.100 --> 18:30.939
but if you'd like my personal

18:30.940 --> 18:32.339
recommendation... Hmm?

18:32.340 --> 18:35.220
This last one on the list
is a favourite of mine.

18:36.340 --> 18:40.339
It is, you might in fact say,
like a face from the past.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.939
Great. I'll have that one please.

18:42.940 --> 18:47.579
It is familiar,
but with the quality of surprise!

18:47.580 --> 18:50.299
Well, surprise me.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.980
I'm certainly endeavouring to, sir.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.780
Sorry that took so long.

19:26.380 --> 19:27.499
You OK?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.220
Yeah, yeah. Me? Fine. I am fine.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.860
Now then, what did you
want to ask me?

19:38.100 --> 19:40.940
More wine? No, I'm good with water,
thanks. Right.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.820
So?
Er, so...

19:45.980 --> 19:48.300
Mary... Listen, um...

19:50.540 --> 19:52.939
I know it hasn't been long,

19:52.940 --> 19:55.340
and I know we haven't known
each other for a long time...

19:57.660 --> 19:59.580
Go on. Yes, I will.

20:00.940 --> 20:04.179
As you know, these last couple
of years haven't been easy for me.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.540
And meeting you...

20:09.180 --> 20:11.019
Yeah, meeting you has been
the best thing

20:11.020 --> 20:13.299
that could have possibly
happened. I agree. What?

20:13.300 --> 20:16.939
I agree, I'm the best thing
that could have happened to you.

20:16.940 --> 20:19.860
Sorry.
Well, no, it's, um...

20:21.740 --> 20:22.780
So...

20:24.660 --> 20:29.660
if you'll have me, Mary,
could you see your way, um...

20:32.460 --> 20:35.340
If you could see your way to...

20:36.540 --> 20:38.459
Sir, you'll find this vintage
exceptionally to your liking.

20:38.460 --> 20:41.139
It has all the qualities of the old,
with the colour of the new.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.019
No, sorry, not now, please. Like
a gaze from a crowd of strangers,

20:44.020 --> 20:46.819
suddenly one is aware of staring
into the face of an old friend.

20:46.820 --> 20:49.020
No, look, seriously,
could you just...?

20:51.460 --> 20:53.259
Interesting thing, a tuxedo.

20:53.260 --> 20:56.860
Lends distinction to friends
and anonymity to waiters.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.460
John?

21:02.820 --> 21:04.820
John, what is it? What?

21:06.140 --> 21:08.300
Well, the short version...

21:09.980 --> 21:11.580
not dead.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.539
Bit mean springing it on you
like that, I know.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.979
Could have given you a heart attack,
probably still will.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.699
But in my defence, it was very funny.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.379
OK, it's not a great defence.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.499
Oh, no, you're... Oh, yes.
Oh, my God!

21:28.500 --> 21:30.699
Not quite. You died,
you jumped off a roof.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.059
No. You're dead.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.100
No, I'm quite sure, I checked.
Excuse me.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.859
Does... does yours rub off too?

21:40.860 --> 21:42.179
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

21:42.180 --> 21:43.819
Do you have any idea
what you've done?!

21:43.820 --> 21:46.659
OK, John, I'm suddenly realising
I probably owe you

21:46.660 --> 21:48.100
some sort of an apology...

21:49.300 --> 21:50.820
All right, just, John, just keep...

21:51.900 --> 21:53.180
Two years.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.700
Two years! Hmm?

22:04.340 --> 22:05.500
I thought...

22:08.180 --> 22:09.380
I thought...

22:10.940 --> 22:12.300
you were dead.

22:13.420 --> 22:14.500
Hmm?

22:16.180 --> 22:19.580
Now, you let me grieve. Hmm.

22:21.820 --> 22:23.420
How could you do that?

22:24.820 --> 22:26.019
How?!

22:26.020 --> 22:28.459
Wait, before you do anything
that you might regret, um,

22:28.460 --> 22:31.100
one question, just let me
ask one question.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.940
Are you really going to keep that?

22:51.100 --> 22:53.459
I calculated that there were
13 possibilities

22:53.460 --> 22:55.619
once I'd invited Moriarty
onto the roof.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.979
'I wanted to avoid dying,
if at all possible.

22:57.980 --> 23:01.739
'The first scenario involved hurling myself
into a parked van filled with washing bags.

23:01.740 --> 23:05.299
'Impossible, the angle was too steep.
Secondly, a system of Japanese wrestling...

23:05.300 --> 23:07.619
'You know, for a genius,
you can be remarkably thick.'

23:07.620 --> 23:11.539
What? I don't care how
you faked it, Sherlock.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.379
I want to know why.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.660
Why? Because Moriarty
had to be stopped.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.099
Oh.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.140
Why, as in...?

23:21.460 --> 23:24.219
I see. Yes. Why?

23:24.220 --> 23:26.099
That's a little more difficult
to explain.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.340
I've got all night.

23:28.460 --> 23:31.219
Actually, um, that was
mostly Mycroft's idea.

23:31.220 --> 23:33.179
Oh, so it was your brother's plan?

23:33.180 --> 23:34.939
Oh, but he would have needed
a confidante.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.539
Mm-hm.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.539
Sorry.

23:38.540 --> 23:41.100
But he was the only one?
The only one who knew?

23:42.700 --> 23:45.539
A couple of others. It was a very
elaborate plan, it had to be.

23:45.540 --> 23:48.939
The next of the 13 possibilities
was... Who else?

23:48.940 --> 23:49.940
Who else knew?

23:51.780 --> 23:53.179
Who?! Molly.

23:53.180 --> 23:54.499
Molly?! John... Molly Hooper

23:54.500 --> 23:56.740
and some of my homeless network
and that's all. OK.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.739
OK.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.179
So just your brother,
Molly Hooper and 100 tramps.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.820
Ha, no! 25 at most.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.740
Seriously, it's not a joke?
You're really keeping this?

24:23.260 --> 24:24.420
Er, yeah.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.020
Sure?

24:28.020 --> 24:29.139
Mary likes it.

24:29.140 --> 24:30.819
Hmm, no, she doesn't.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.300
She does. She doesn't.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.379
Oh, don't.

24:36.380 --> 24:38.259
Oh, brilliant(!)
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

24:38.260 --> 24:39.699
I didn't know how to tell you...

24:39.700 --> 24:42.020
Right, no, no, this is charming.
I've really missed this(!)

24:45.500 --> 24:48.739
One word, Sherlock,
that is all I would have needed!

24:48.740 --> 24:51.220
One word to let me know
that you were alive!

24:53.100 --> 24:56.459
I've nearly been in contact so
many times, but...

24:56.460 --> 24:59.299
I worried that, you know, you might
say something indiscreet. What?

24:59.300 --> 25:01.699
You know, let the cat out of the bag.
So this is my fault!

25:01.700 --> 25:04.099
Oh, God! Why am I the only one
who thinks that this is wrong?!

25:04.100 --> 25:06.219
The only one reacting
like a human being!

25:06.220 --> 25:08.019
Over-reacting. Over-reacting!

25:08.020 --> 25:11.299
John! Over-reacting! So you fake
your own death and you waltz in here

25:11.300 --> 25:14.179
large as bloody life! Shh. But I'm
not meant to have a problem with it,

25:14.180 --> 25:16.739
cos Sherlock Holmes thinks it's
a perfectly OK thing to do!

25:16.740 --> 25:19.179
Shut up! I don't want everyone
knowing I'm still alive!

25:19.180 --> 25:21.859
Oh, so it's still a secret, is it?!
Yes, it's still a secret!

25:21.860 --> 25:24.500
Promise you won't tell anyone?
Swear to God!

25:30.100 --> 25:31.924
London is in danger, John.
There's an imminent

25:31.936 --> 25:33.460
terrorist attack and
I need your help.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.540
My help?

25:39.140 --> 25:42.419
You have missed this, admit it.

25:42.420 --> 25:45.579
The thrill of the chase,
the blood pumping through your veins,

25:45.580 --> 25:47.900
just the two of us
against the rest of the world.

25:49.820 --> 25:52.019
I don't understand,
I said I'm sorry,

25:52.020 --> 25:53.939
isn't that what you're supposed
to do?

25:53.940 --> 25:57.779
Gosh, you don't know anything
about human nature, do you?

25:57.780 --> 25:59.859
Hmm, nature? No.

25:59.860 --> 26:02.740
Human? No.

26:03.740 --> 26:04.860
I'll talk him round.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.860
You will?
Oh, yeah.

26:21.060 --> 26:22.060
Mary.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.860
Can you believe his nerve?

26:42.020 --> 26:43.140
I like him.

26:44.540 --> 26:45.939
What?

26:45.940 --> 26:47.100
I like him.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.700
Those things will kill you.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.819
Oh, you bastard!

28:00.820 --> 28:02.580
It's time to come back.

28:03.740 --> 28:05.979
You've been letting things
slide, Graham.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.180
Greg.
Greg.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.860
'Very common belief,
with an anti terrorism bill...'

28:30.180 --> 28:31.779
'..the Government feels duty-bound

28:31.780 --> 28:34.380
'to push through the legislation
with all due exped...'

29:02.700 --> 29:04.179
'Now, stay exactly where you are.'

29:04.180 --> 29:05.459
Where are you?

29:05.460 --> 29:06.860
'Don't move.

29:08.940 --> 29:11.179
'Keep your eyes fixed on me.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.339
'What? What's happening?
What's going on?'

29:14.340 --> 29:17.539
Please, will you do this for me?
Please.

29:17.540 --> 29:18.859
Do what?

29:18.860 --> 29:20.019
'This phone call...'

29:20.020 --> 29:21.699
it's my note.

29:21.700 --> 29:25.099
'That's what people do,
don't they?'

29:25.100 --> 29:27.299
Leave a note.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.699
'Leave a note when?'

29:29.700 --> 29:31.340
Goodbye, John. 'No.'

29:32.860 --> 29:34.099
Sherlock!

29:34.100 --> 29:35.500
Oh, ho!

29:50.180 --> 29:53.259
What?! Are you out of your mind?!

29:53.260 --> 29:54.779
I don't see why not.

29:54.780 --> 29:56.939
It's just as plausible
as some of your theories.

29:56.940 --> 29:59.219
Look, if you're not going to take it
seriously, Laura...

29:59.220 --> 30:01.219
I do take it seriously.

30:01.220 --> 30:02.979
I don't think we should wear hats.

30:02.980 --> 30:06.619
I founded 'The Empty Hearse'
so like-minded people could meet,

30:06.620 --> 30:08.500
discuss theories!

30:10.180 --> 30:12.019
Sherlock's still out there.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.460
I'm convinced of it.

30:17.460 --> 30:18.740
Oh, my God!

30:24.580 --> 30:27.220
Oh... my... God!

30:32.460 --> 30:34.619
"His movements were so silent,"

30:34.620 --> 30:36.379
"so furtive he reminded me"

30:36.380 --> 30:38.979
"of a trained bloodhound
picking out a scent."

30:38.980 --> 30:42.099
You what? "I couldn't help thinking
what an amazing criminal he'd make"

30:42.100 --> 30:45.459
"if he turned his talents
against the law." Don't read that.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.939
Famous blog, finally.
Come on, that's...

30:47.940 --> 30:51.259
Ancient history, yes, I know, but it's
not though, is it, because he's...

30:51.260 --> 30:52.780
What are you doing?

30:53.860 --> 30:55.139
Having a wash.

30:55.140 --> 30:56.939
You're shaving it off.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.179
Well, you hate it.
Sherlock hates it.

30:59.180 --> 31:01.380
Apparently everyone hates it. Oh!

31:02.380 --> 31:05.299
Are you going to see him again?
No, I'm going to work.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.499
Oh, and after work, are you going
to see him again? No.

31:07.500 --> 31:10.019
God, I had six months
of bristly kisses for me

31:10.020 --> 31:11.939
and then his nibs turns up...

31:11.940 --> 31:14.499
I don't shave for Sherlock Holmes.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.299
You should put that on a T-shirt.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.139
Shut up. Or what?

31:18.140 --> 31:20.180
Or I'll marry you.

31:27.380 --> 31:30.499
London, it's like a great cesspool
into which all kinds

31:30.500 --> 31:35.619
of criminals, agents and
Dr.ifters are irresistibly Dr.ained.

31:35.620 --> 31:41.979
Sometimes it's not a question of
who, it's a question of who knows?

31:41.980 --> 31:46.020
If this man cancels his papers,
I need to know.

31:49.340 --> 31:53.099
If this woman leaves London without
putting her dog into kennels,

31:53.100 --> 31:54.659
I need to know.

31:54.660 --> 31:57.700
I have certain people,
they are markers.

31:58.780 --> 32:01.579
If they start to move,
I'll know something's up.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.660
Like rats deserting a sinking ship.

32:18.340 --> 32:20.179
All very interesting, Sherlock,

32:20.180 --> 32:23.019
but the terror alert has been
raised to critical.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.659
Boring. Your move.

32:25.660 --> 32:29.379
We have solid information,
an attack IS coming.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.739
Solid information, a secret terrorist
organisation is planning an attack...

32:32.740 --> 32:36.379
That's what secret terrorist organisations
do, isn't it? It's their version of golf.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.939
An agent gave his life
to tell us that. Oh, well,

32:38.940 --> 32:42.620
perhaps he shouldn't have done. He was
obviously just trying to show off.

32:44.180 --> 32:48.339
None of these 'markers' of yours
is behaving in any way suspiciously?

32:48.340 --> 32:49.659
Your move.

32:49.660 --> 32:52.499
No, Mycroft, but you have
to trust me. I'll find the answer.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.699
But it'll be in an odd phrase
in an on-line blog,

32:54.700 --> 32:56.579
or an unexpected trip
to the countryside,

32:56.580 --> 32:59.899
or a misplaced lonely hearts ad.

32:59.900 --> 33:00.939
Your move!

33:00.940 --> 33:04.699
I've given the Prime Minister my
personal assurance you're on the case.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.820
I am on the case, we both are,
look at us right now.

33:07.940 --> 33:09.419
Oh, bugger! Whoopsy!

33:09.420 --> 33:12.339
Can't handle a broken heart.
How very telling.

33:12.340 --> 33:13.899
Don't be smart.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.419
That takes me back.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.539
"Don't be smart, Sherlock,
I'm the smart one."

33:17.540 --> 33:18.899
I am the smart one.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.419
I used to think I was an idiot.

33:20.420 --> 33:22.619
Both of us thought you were
an idiot, Sherlock.

33:22.620 --> 33:25.699
We had nothing else to go on,
until we met other chilDr.en.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.499
Oh, yes, that was a mistake.
Ghastly. What were they thinking of?

33:28.500 --> 33:30.899
Probably something about
trying to make friends.

33:30.900 --> 33:33.619
Oh, yes. Friends.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.819
Of course, you go in
for that sort of thing now.

33:35.820 --> 33:38.459
And you don't? Ever?

33:38.460 --> 33:40.299
If you seem slow to me, Sherlock,

33:40.300 --> 33:42.899
can you imagine what real people
are like?

33:42.900 --> 33:44.819
I'm living in a world of goldfish.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.659
Yes, but I've been away
for two years.

33:47.660 --> 33:49.619
So? Oh, I don't know,

33:49.620 --> 33:52.299
I thought perhaps you might have
found yourself a...

33:52.300 --> 33:55.739
goldfish. Change the subject, now.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.859
Rest assured, Mycroft,

33:56.860 --> 33:59.139
whatever this underground
network of yours is up to,

33:59.140 --> 34:02.459
the secret will reside in something
seemingly insignificant or bizarre.

34:02.460 --> 34:04.059
Ooh-ooh. Speaking of which...

34:04.060 --> 34:07.939
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it!

34:07.940 --> 34:10.779
Him sitting in his chair again.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.819
Oh, isn't it wonderful, Mr. Holmes?

34:12.820 --> 34:15.779
I can barely contain myself(!)
Oh, he really can, you know.

34:15.780 --> 34:18.860
He's secretly pleased to see you,
underneath all that.

34:19.860 --> 34:21.938
Sorry, which of us?

34:21.940 --> 34:23.938
Both of you.

34:23.940 --> 34:25.938
Let's play something different.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.779
Why are we playing games?!

34:27.780 --> 34:30.059
London's terror alert has been
raised to critical,

34:30.060 --> 34:31.498
I'm just passing the time.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.339
Let's do deductions.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.860
Client left this while I was out,
what do you reckon?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.739
I'm busy.

34:39.739 --> 34:41.659
Oh, go on, it's been an age.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.859
I always win.
Which is why you can't resist.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.659
I find nothing irresistible in the
hat of a well-travelled anxious,

34:47.659 --> 34:50.380
sentimental, unfit creature of habit
with appalling halitosis.

34:51.820 --> 34:54.659
Damn.
Isolated too, don't you think?

34:54.659 --> 34:55.938
Why would he be isolated?

34:55.940 --> 34:58.099
"He?" Obviously.
Why? Size of the hat?

34:58.100 --> 35:00.699
Don't be silly.
Some women have large heads too.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.459
No, he's recently had his hair cut,

35:02.460 --> 35:07.019
you can see the little hairs adhering
to the perspiration stains on the inside.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.339
Some women have short hair too.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.428
Balance of probability. Not
that you've ever spoken

35:11.440 --> 35:13.579
to a woman with short hair,
or, you know, any woman.

35:13.580 --> 35:16.419
Stains show he's out of condition.
He's sentimental because the hat

35:16.420 --> 35:18.899
has been repaired, three, four...
Five times. Very neatly.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.928
The cost of the repairs exceeds
the cost of the hat, so

35:20.940 --> 35:22.979
he's mawkishly attached to it.
But it's more than that.

35:22.980 --> 35:25.285
One patch or two patches would
indicate sentimentality. But

35:25.297 --> 35:27.459
Five? Five's obsessive behaviour.
Obsessive compulsive.

35:27.460 --> 35:28.859
Hardly. Your client left it behind.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.099
What sort of an obsessive compulsive
would do that?

35:31.100 --> 35:33.419
The earlier patches are extensively
sun bleached,

35:33.420 --> 35:34.859
so he's worn it abroad, in Peru.

35:34.860 --> 35:36.139
Peru? This is a chullo.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.659
The classic headgear of Andes,
it's made of alpaca.

35:38.660 --> 35:41.339
No. No? Icelandic sheep wool.
Similar, but very distinctive,

35:41.340 --> 35:44.139
if you know what you're looking for.
I've written a blog on the varying

35:44.140 --> 35:46.139
tensile strengths of different
natural fibres.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.939
I'm sure there's a crying
need for that(!)

35:47.940 --> 35:51.179
You said he was anxious? The bobble on
the left side has been badly chewed,

35:51.180 --> 35:53.699
which shows he's a man of a nervous
disposition, but...

35:53.700 --> 35:55.099
But also a creature of habit,

35:55.100 --> 35:57.659
because he hasn't chewed
the bobble on the right. Precisely.

35:57.660 --> 35:59.605
A quick sniff of the offending
bobble tells us all

35:59.617 --> 36:01.419
we need to know about the
state of his breath.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.859
Brilliant! Elementary.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.979
But you've missed his isolation.

36:04.980 --> 36:06.579
I don't see it.

36:06.580 --> 36:07.819
Plain as day. Where?

36:07.820 --> 36:09.179
There for all to see. Tell me.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.659
Plain as the nose on your... Tell me!

36:11.660 --> 36:13.699
Well, anybody who wears
a hat as stupid as this

36:13.700 --> 36:16.179
isn't in the habit of hanging
around other people, is he?

36:16.180 --> 36:18.859
Not at all. Maybe he just
doesn't mind being different.

36:18.860 --> 36:21.180
He doesn't necessarily
have to be isolated.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.700
Exactly.

36:25.380 --> 36:26.620
I'm sorry?

36:27.740 --> 36:29.579
He's different, so what?
Why would he mind?

36:29.580 --> 36:31.060
You're quite right.

36:33.660 --> 36:36.100
Why would anyone mind?

36:39.980 --> 36:42.380
I am not lonely, Sherlock.

36:47.540 --> 36:48.820
How would you know?

36:51.860 --> 36:56.060
Yes. Back to work,
if you don't mind. Good morning.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.020
Right, back to work.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.299
Mr. Summerson.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.139
Right. Undescended testicle.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.540
Right.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.499
Sherlock?
Hmm?

37:22.500 --> 37:24.299
Talk to John.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.060
I've tried talking to him.
He made his position quite clear.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.979
Just relax, Mr. Summerson.

37:31.980 --> 37:33.339
What did he say?

37:33.340 --> 37:35.419
F...
Cough.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.100
Oh, dear.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.539
Hi?

37:41.540 --> 37:43.740
'Mr.s Reeves. Thrush.'

37:45.340 --> 37:46.380
Right.

37:53.580 --> 37:55.100
You wanted to see me?

37:56.180 --> 37:59.940
Yes. Molly... Yes? Would you...?

38:03.180 --> 38:06.099
Would you like to...
Have dinner? ..Solve crimes?

38:06.100 --> 38:07.539
Um...

38:07.540 --> 38:09.979
Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of,
Mr.s Reeves.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.579
It's very common,
but I'm recommending a course of...

38:13.580 --> 38:15.899
Monkey glands,
but enough about Professor Presbury.

38:15.900 --> 38:19.219
Tell us more about your case, Mr. Harcourt.
You sure about this? Absolutely.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.739
Should I be making notes? If it makes you
feel better. That's what John says he does.

38:22.740 --> 38:25.859
So if I'm being John... You're not
being John, you're being yourself.

38:25.860 --> 38:28.059
Well, absolutely no one should have
been able to empty

38:28.060 --> 38:30.260
that bank account other than myself
and Helen.

38:32.820 --> 38:36.419
Why didn't you assume it was your wife?
Because I've always had total faith in her.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.619
No, it's because YOU emptied it.
Weight-loss, hair dye, Botox, affair.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.740
Lawyer. Next!

38:42.500 --> 38:44.580
This is Mr. Blake. Piles.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.860
Mr. Blake, hi.

38:51.060 --> 38:54.300
And your pen-pal's emails
just stopped, did they?

38:56.540 --> 38:59.339
And you really thought
he was the one, didn't you?

38:59.340 --> 39:00.820
The love of your life?

39:05.340 --> 39:07.539
Stepfather posing as on-line
boyfriend.

39:07.540 --> 39:08.699
What?

39:08.700 --> 39:10.099
Breaks it off, breaks her heart.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.379
She swears off relationships,
stays at home.

39:12.380 --> 39:13.979
He still has her wage coming in.

39:13.980 --> 39:16.819
Mr. Windibank, you have been
a complete and utter...

39:16.820 --> 39:18.219
Piss pot.

39:18.220 --> 39:22.419
It's nothing to worry about, just a
small infection, by the sound of it.

39:22.420 --> 39:25.099
Dr. Verner is your usual GP, yes?

39:25.100 --> 39:29.259
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He looked after me man and boy.

39:29.260 --> 39:34.219
I run a little shop
just on the corner of Church Street.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.899
Oh. Magazines and DVDs.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.699
I've brought along a few little
beauties that might interest you...

39:40.700 --> 39:45.339
Tree Worshippers. Oh, that's
a corker. It's very saucy.

39:45.340 --> 39:48.659
And British Birds.
Same sort of thing.

39:48.660 --> 39:49.859
I'm fine, thanks.

39:49.860 --> 39:52.179
The Holy War.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.739
Sounds a bit Dr.y, I know,

39:54.740 --> 40:00.059
but there's a nun with all these
holes in her habit...

40:00.060 --> 40:01.579
Jesus! Sherlock.

40:01.580 --> 40:03.579
What? What do you want?

40:03.580 --> 40:04.819
Uh?

40:04.820 --> 40:08.339
Have you come to torment me? What are you
talking about? "What are you talking...?"

40:08.340 --> 40:10.939
What, do you think I'm going
to be fooled by this bloody beard?!

40:10.940 --> 40:13.139
You're crazy! No, no, no, no, no.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.939
It's not as good as your French!
Not as good as your French.

40:15.940 --> 40:17.779
It's not even a good disguise,
Sherlock!

40:17.780 --> 40:20.540
Where did you get it from,
a bloody joke shop...?!

40:23.580 --> 40:24.939
Oh, my God!

40:24.940 --> 40:27.459
I, I am so sorry.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.059
Oh, my God!

40:29.060 --> 40:31.580
Please... It's fine.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.859
This one's got us all baffled.

40:36.860 --> 40:38.420
Hmm, I don't doubt it.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.100
What is it?

41:35.460 --> 41:37.539
You're onto something, aren't you?

41:37.540 --> 41:38.779
Maybe.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.379
'Show off!'

41:40.380 --> 41:42.699
Shut up, John.
What? Hmm?

41:42.700 --> 41:44.340
Nothing.

41:46.940 --> 41:49.499
Hello. Hmm.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.499
Are you sure? I'm sure. OK.

41:52.500 --> 41:54.620
I'm late for Cath.
I'll see you later.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.460
Bye. Bye.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.699
This going to be
your new arrangement, is it?

42:07.700 --> 42:09.539
Just giving it a go.

42:09.540 --> 42:11.379
Right.

42:11.380 --> 42:12.820
So, John?

42:14.420 --> 42:15.980
Not really in the picture any more.

42:20.660 --> 42:21.859
Trains?

42:21.860 --> 42:23.380
Trains.

42:34.500 --> 42:38.099
Male, 40 to 50.
Oh, sorry, did you want to be...?

42:38.100 --> 42:40.019
Er, no, please, be my guest.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.179
'You jealous?'

42:41.180 --> 42:42.380
Shut up!

42:48.380 --> 42:49.819
It doesn't make sense.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.899
What doesn't?

42:51.900 --> 42:54.099
This skeleton,
it can't be any more than...

42:54.100 --> 42:56.020
Six months old.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.140
Wow!

43:11.980 --> 43:14.539
"How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper."

43:14.540 --> 43:16.820
Uh-huh. That's impossible.
Welcome to my world.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.699
'Smart arse!'

43:20.700 --> 43:23.739
I won't insult your intelligence
by explaining it to you.

43:23.740 --> 43:25.299
No, please, insult away.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.939
'You forgot to put your collar up.'

43:26.940 --> 43:29.019
The corpse is, is six months old.

43:29.020 --> 43:32.099
It's Dr.essed in a shoddy Victorian
outfit from a museum.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.219
It's been displayed on a dummy
for many years,

43:34.220 --> 43:37.579
in a case facing south-east, judging
from the fading of the fabric.

43:37.580 --> 43:41.859
It was sold off in a fire damage sale
a week ago.

43:41.860 --> 43:44.019
So the whole thing was a fake?

43:44.020 --> 43:45.259
Yes.

43:45.260 --> 43:47.059
Looked so promising.

43:47.060 --> 43:48.099
Facile.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.099
Why would someone go to all
that trouble?

43:50.100 --> 43:51.420
Why indeed, John?

43:59.980 --> 44:03.700
'Mind the gap.
Mind the gap.'

44:06.020 --> 44:07.619
Oh. Thanks for hanging onto it.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.820
No problem.

44:10.460 --> 44:13.420
So, what's this all about,
Mr. Shilcott?

44:15.620 --> 44:17.379
My girlfriend's a big fan of yours.

44:17.380 --> 44:18.580
Girlfriend?!

44:20.500 --> 44:22.179
Sorry. Do go on.

44:22.180 --> 44:24.019
I like trains.

44:24.020 --> 44:27.699
Yes... I work on the Tube, on the
District Line, and part of my job

44:27.700 --> 44:30.299
is to wipe the security footage
after it's been cleared.

44:30.300 --> 44:35.220
I was just whizzing through
and I found something a bit bizarre.

44:38.740 --> 44:41.699
Now, this was a week ago.

44:41.700 --> 44:44.299
The last train on the Friday night,
Westminster Station.

44:44.300 --> 44:46.579
Now, this man gets into
the last car.

44:46.580 --> 44:48.659
Car? They're cars, not carriages.

44:48.660 --> 44:51.499
It's a legacy of the early American
involvement in the Tube system.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.939
He said he liked trains.

44:52.940 --> 44:56.619
And the next stop,
St James' Park Station.

44:56.620 --> 44:58.100
And...

45:03.260 --> 45:04.899
I thought you'd like it.

45:04.900 --> 45:08.020
He gets into the last car
at Westminster. The only passenger.

45:12.980 --> 45:15.620
And the car is empty
at St James's Park Station.

45:18.740 --> 45:21.619
Explain that, Mr. Holmes.

45:21.620 --> 45:25.259
Couldn't he have just jumped off? There's a
safety mechanism that prevents the doors

45:25.260 --> 45:27.739
from opening in transit.
But there's something else,

45:27.740 --> 45:30.019
the Dr.iver of that train
hasn't been to work since.

45:30.020 --> 45:34.099
According to his flatmate, he's
on holiday. Came into some money.

45:34.100 --> 45:35.500
Bought off?

45:36.580 --> 45:38.139
Hmm?

45:38.140 --> 45:40.019
So if the Dr.iver of the train
was in on it,

45:40.020 --> 45:41.539
then the passenger did get off.

45:41.540 --> 45:43.651
There's nowhere he could go.
It's a straight run

45:43.663 --> 45:45.699
on the District Line
between the two stations.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.219
There's no side tunnels,
no maintenance tunnels.

45:48.220 --> 45:49.860
Nothing on any map. Nothing.

45:51.020 --> 45:53.939
Train never stops
and a man vanishes.

45:53.940 --> 45:55.540
Good, innit?

46:01.020 --> 46:02.260
I know that face.

46:53.340 --> 46:54.500
Excuse you(!)

47:24.860 --> 47:27.539
The journey between those stations
usually takes five minutes

47:27.540 --> 47:30.819
and that one took ten. Ten minutes to get
from Westminster to St James's Park.

47:30.820 --> 47:34.139
I'll need maps, lots of maps.
Older maps, all the maps. Right.

47:34.140 --> 47:36.099
Fancy some chips? What?

47:36.100 --> 47:38.659
I know a fantastic fish shop
just off the Marylebone Road,

47:38.660 --> 47:40.699
the owner always gives me
extra portions.

47:40.700 --> 47:42.219
Did you get him off a murder charge?

47:42.220 --> 47:43.860
No, I helped him
put up some shelves.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.060
Sherlock? Hmm?

47:48.060 --> 47:51.100
What was today about?
Saying thank you.

47:52.020 --> 47:53.979
For what?

47:53.980 --> 47:57.539
For everything you did for me.
It's OK. It's my pleasure.

47:57.540 --> 48:00.139
No. I mean it.

48:00.140 --> 48:02.579
I don't mean pleasure,
I mean I didn't mind.

48:02.580 --> 48:06.339
I wanted to... Moriarty slipped up,
he made a mistake.

48:06.340 --> 48:10.659
Because the one person he thought
didn't matter at all to me

48:10.660 --> 48:14.019
was the one person
that mattered the most.

48:14.020 --> 48:15.660
You made it all possible.

48:17.700 --> 48:20.619
But you can't do this again,
can you?

48:20.620 --> 48:24.459
I've had a lovely day.
I'd love to, I just, um...

48:24.460 --> 48:26.820
Hmm, congratulations, by the way.

48:28.540 --> 48:31.259
He's not from work.

48:31.260 --> 48:33.699
We met through friends,
old-fashioned way.

48:33.700 --> 48:37.859
He's nice, we've got a dog,
we, we go to the pub on weekends

48:37.860 --> 48:41.739
and I've met his mum and dad
and his friends and all his family.

48:41.740 --> 48:43.859
I've no idea why I'm telling
you any of this...

48:43.860 --> 48:47.219
I hope you'll be very happy,
Molly Hooper.

48:47.220 --> 48:48.460
You deserve it.

48:50.820 --> 48:54.259
After all, not all the men you fall
for can turn out to be sociopaths.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.860
No? No.

49:12.620 --> 49:14.540
Maybe it's just my type.

50:23.340 --> 50:27.899
Oh, Mr.s Hudson, sorry, I think
someone's got John. John Watson?

50:27.900 --> 50:30.139
Hang on, who are you?!

50:30.140 --> 50:31.819
Oh, I'm his fiancee.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.220
Oh. Mary?

50:34.460 --> 50:35.899
What's wrong?

50:35.900 --> 50:37.379
Someone sent me this.

50:37.380 --> 50:39.379
At first I thought it was just
a Bible thing,

50:39.380 --> 50:40.699
you know, spam, but it's not.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.300
It's a skip code.

50:44.180 --> 50:46.099
First word, then every third.

50:46.100 --> 50:47.780
"Save John Watson."

50:52.060 --> 50:53.779
Now!

50:53.780 --> 50:55.099
Where are we going?

50:55.100 --> 50:59.099
St James The Less, it's a church.
20 minutes by car.

50:59.100 --> 51:00.699
Did you Dr.ive here? Er, yes.

51:00.700 --> 51:02.620
It's too slow, it's too slow.

51:03.860 --> 51:06.699
Watch out! What are we waiting for?!

51:06.700 --> 51:07.980
This.

51:21.860 --> 51:23.139
What does it mean?

51:23.140 --> 51:24.459
What are they going to do to him?

51:24.460 --> 51:25.780
I don't know!

51:48.900 --> 51:49.900
Damn!

51:59.220 --> 52:01.780
Oi! Oi!
You can't go down there!

53:17.100 --> 53:20.899
No, it's not going to work,
with that.

53:20.900 --> 53:24.259
I'll get something to help it along.
Yeah.

53:24.260 --> 53:26.460
Help! Argh!

53:49.180 --> 53:51.819
He doesn't like it, Daddy. Huh?

53:51.820 --> 53:53.739
Guy Fawkes, he doesn't like it.

53:53.740 --> 53:56.899
Stay back, Zoe. Back!

53:56.900 --> 53:57.940
Now.

54:19.660 --> 54:21.140
What does it mean?

54:23.260 --> 54:25.060
Oh, my God!

54:38.980 --> 54:40.220
Help!

54:46.260 --> 54:47.460
Stand back!

54:54.500 --> 54:56.459
Move! Move! Move!

54:56.460 --> 54:58.739
Move! Move!

54:58.740 --> 55:00.819
John! John!

55:00.820 --> 55:02.219
John! John!

55:02.220 --> 55:03.659
Get up, John!

55:03.660 --> 55:05.379
John! John?!

55:05.380 --> 55:06.619
Help!

55:06.620 --> 55:08.220
John!

55:26.820 --> 55:30.939
John! John!

55:30.940 --> 55:32.820
Hey, John.

55:46.740 --> 55:49.859
'Which wasn't the way
I'd put it at all. Silly woman.'

55:49.860 --> 55:53.299
Anyway, it was then that
I first noticed it was missing.

55:53.300 --> 55:56.139
I said, "Have you checked
down the back of the sofa?"

55:56.140 --> 55:59.219
He's always losing things down the
back of the sofa, aren't you, dear?

55:59.220 --> 56:00.339
Afraid so.

56:00.340 --> 56:03.819
Oh, keys, small change, sweeties.

56:03.820 --> 56:06.299
Especially his glasses. Glasses.

56:06.300 --> 56:08.659
Blooming things. I said,
"Why don't you get a chain,"

56:08.660 --> 56:10.099
"wear them round your neck?"

56:10.100 --> 56:12.939
And he says, "What,
like Larry Grayson!" Larry Grayson.

56:12.940 --> 56:16.139
So did you find it eventually,
your lottery ticket?

56:16.140 --> 56:18.299
Well, yes, thank goodness.

56:18.300 --> 56:20.459
We caught the coach on time
after all.

56:20.460 --> 56:23.459
We managed to see St Paul's,
the Tower,

56:23.460 --> 56:26.099
but they weren't letting
anyone into Parliament.

56:26.100 --> 56:27.700
Some big debate going on.

56:29.740 --> 56:32.339
John? Sorry, you're busy.
No, no, no, they were just leaving.

56:32.340 --> 56:34.819
No, oh, were we? Yes.
No, no, if you've got a case...

56:34.820 --> 56:36.488
No, not a case. Yeah, go.
We're here till

56:36.500 --> 56:38.499
Saturday, remember. Yes, wonderful.
Just get out!

56:38.500 --> 56:41.699
Yes, well, give us a ring.
Very nice, yes, good. Get out!

56:41.700 --> 56:43.699
I can't tell you how glad
we are, Sherlock.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.819
All that time people
thinking the worst.

56:45.820 --> 56:47.739
We're just so pleased it's all over.

56:47.740 --> 56:49.379
Ring up more often, won't you?

56:49.380 --> 56:51.459
Mm-hm. She worries.

56:51.460 --> 56:52.660
Promise?

56:54.020 --> 56:55.099
Promise.

56:55.100 --> 56:56.260
Oh, for God...

56:58.860 --> 57:01.099
Sorry about that. No, it's fine.

57:01.100 --> 57:02.259
Clients?

57:02.260 --> 57:04.179
Just my parents.

57:04.180 --> 57:06.219
Your parents?
In town for a few days.

57:06.220 --> 57:09.019
Your parents? Mycroft promised to
take them to a matinee of Les Mis.

57:09.020 --> 57:10.779
Tried to talk me into doing it.

57:10.780 --> 57:13.179
Those were your parents? Yes.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.540
Well...

57:16.740 --> 57:20.779
that is not what I... What?

57:20.780 --> 57:23.900
I mean, they're just so...

57:25.660 --> 57:27.419
ordinary.

57:27.420 --> 57:29.900
It's a cross I have to bear.

57:37.780 --> 57:38.900
Did they know too?

57:39.900 --> 57:42.980
Hmm? That you spent the last
two years playing hide and seek?

57:44.060 --> 57:46.979
Maybe. Ah, so that's why
they weren't at the funeral!

57:46.980 --> 57:48.980
Sorry, sorry again. Hmm.

57:52.700 --> 57:53.860
Sorry.

57:56.580 --> 57:58.339
So you've shaved it off then?

57:58.340 --> 58:00.739
Yeah. Wasn't working for me.

58:00.740 --> 58:02.819
Yeah, I'm glad. You didn't like it?

58:02.820 --> 58:04.620
No, I prefer my doctors
clean-shaven.

58:06.660 --> 58:08.940
That's not a sentence
you hear every day.

58:12.700 --> 58:13.899
How are you feeling?

58:13.900 --> 58:16.459
Yeah, not bad. Bit smoked.

58:16.460 --> 58:17.540
Right.

58:21.020 --> 58:23.340
Last night, who did that?

58:24.940 --> 58:26.579
And why did they target me?

58:26.580 --> 58:27.859
I don't know.

58:27.860 --> 58:29.739
Is it someone trying
to get to you through me?

58:29.740 --> 58:32.539
Is it something to do with this
terrorist thing you talked about?

58:32.540 --> 58:35.339
I don't know, I can't see
the pattern. It's too nebulous.

58:35.340 --> 58:37.677
Why would an agent give his
life to tell us something

58:37.689 --> 58:39.819
incredibly insignificant?
That's what's strange.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.539
Give his life?
According to Mycroft.

58:41.540 --> 58:44.820
There's an underground network planning
an attack on London, that's all we know.

58:48.020 --> 58:50.019
These are my rats, John. Rats?

58:50.020 --> 58:52.859
My markers, agents, lowlifes.
People who might find theMs.elves

58:52.860 --> 58:55.540
arrested or their diplomatic
immunity suddenly rescinded.

58:56.660 --> 58:59.379
If one of them starts acting
suspiciously, we know something's up.

58:59.380 --> 59:01.979
Five of them are behaving perfectly
normally, but the sixth...

59:01.980 --> 59:03.099
I know him, don't I?

59:03.100 --> 59:06.259
Lord Moran, Peer of the Realm.
Minister for Overseas Development.

59:06.260 --> 59:08.779
Pillar of the Establishment. Yes.

59:08.780 --> 59:10.899
He's been working for North Korea
since 1996.

59:10.900 --> 59:13.819
What? He's the big rat,
rat number one.

59:13.820 --> 59:16.660
He's just done something
very suspicious indeed.

59:21.620 --> 59:23.979
Yeah, that's odd.

59:23.980 --> 59:25.779
There's nowhere
he could have got off?

59:25.780 --> 59:27.939
Not according to the maps.

59:27.940 --> 59:30.379
There's something, something,
something I'm missing.

59:30.380 --> 59:32.420
Something staring me in the face.

59:33.700 --> 59:36.500
Any idea who they are,
this underground network?

59:38.740 --> 59:41.859
Intelligence must have a list
of the most obvious ones.

59:41.860 --> 59:43.419
Our rat's just come out of his den.

59:43.420 --> 59:45.619
Al-Qaeda? The IRA have been getting
restless again,

59:45.620 --> 59:48.619
maybe they're going to make an
appearance... Yes, yes, yes, yes!

59:48.620 --> 59:50.139
I've been an idiot, a blind idiot!

59:50.140 --> 59:52.539
What? Oh, that's good.
That could be brilliant!

59:52.540 --> 59:55.859
What are you on about? Mycroft's
intelligence is not nebulous at all,

59:55.860 --> 59:57.579
it's specific, incredibly specific.

59:57.580 --> 59:58.859
What do you mean?

59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.619
It's not an underground network,
John, it's an Underground network!

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.459
Right.

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.059
What? Sometimes a deception
is so audacious, so outrageous

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:09.259
that you can't see it even when
it's staring you in the face. Look,

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.379
seven carriages
leave Westminster. Mm.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.260
And only six carriages
arrive at St James's Park.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.379
Ah, but that's, I mean,
it's impossible.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.579
Moran didn't disappear.
The entire tube compartment did.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.819
The Dr.iver must have diverted the train
and then detached the last carriage.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.659
Detached it where? You said there
was nothing between those stations.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.939
Not on the maps, but once
you eliminate the other factors,

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.499
the remaining thing must be the truth. That
carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.019
But why, though?

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.579
Why detach it in the first place?

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.539
It vanishes between St James's Park
and Westminster.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.259
Lord Moran vanishes.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:47.260
You're kidnapped and nearly burnt
to death at a fireworks party.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.379
What's the date, John, today's date?

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.020
Hmm? November the... Oh, God!

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.699
Lord Moran,
he's a Peer of the Realm.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.019
Normally he'd sit in the House.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:03.900
Tonight, there's an all-night sitting
to vote on the new anti-terrorism bill.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.499
But he won't be there, not tonight.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.499
Not the 5th November.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.219
"Remember, remember..."

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.940
"Gunpowder, treason and plot!"

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.539
'There's nothing down there,
Mr. Holmes, I told you.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.179
'No sidings, no ghost stations.'

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.619
There has to be, check again.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.899
This whole area is a big mess
of old and new stuff.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.179
Charing Cross is made up
of bits of older stations,

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.699
like Trafalgar Square, Strand.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.899
No, it's none of those,
we've accounted for those.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.019
St Margaret Street, Bridge Street,
Sumatra Road, Parliament Street...

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.099
'Hang on, hang on, Sumatra Road?

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.539
'You mentioned Sumatra Road,
Mr. Holmes? There is something,

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.059
'I knew it rang a bell! Yes.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.619
'There was a station down there.'

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.379
Well, why isn't it on the maps?

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.899
'Because it was closed
before it ever opened.' What?

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.379
'They built the platforMs., even the
staircases, but it all got tied up

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.540
'in legal disputes and so they never
built the station on the surface.'

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.819
It's right underneath
the Palace of Westminster.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.539
So what's down there, a bomb?

01:01:58.540 --> 01:01:59.980
Oh.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.179
'With many commentators saying

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.859
'the vote on the Terrorism Bill
will be too close to call,

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.899
'MPs are now making their way
into the Chamber for what

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.659
'the Government is calling "the most
important vote of this Parliament."

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.899
'Over now to our...'

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.939
'What freedoMs..
Exactly are we protecting

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.099
'if we start spying on our
own people?

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.900
'This is a Orwellian measure
on a scale unprecedented...'

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.899
There's a bomb, then? The tube
carriage is carrying a bomb.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.619
Must be. Right.

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.219
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police. What? No!

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.979
Sherlock, this isn't a game,
they need to evacuate Parliament.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:55.299
They'll get in the way, they always
do. This is cleaner, more efficient.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.420
And illegal?
A bit.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.819
What are you doing?

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.100
Coming.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.619
I don't understand.
Well, that's a first.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.540
There's nowhere else it could be.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:47.420
Oh!

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.060
What?!

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.699
Hang on, Sherlock...?
What? That's, isn't it live?

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.459
Perfectly safe as long as we avoid
touching the rails.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.259
Of course, yeah,
avoid the rails. Great!

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.619
This way.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.140
Are you sure? Sure.

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.819
Ha!

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.140
Look at that.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.220
John... Hmm?

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.420
Demolition charges.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.940
It's empty. There's nothing.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.060
Isn't there?

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:01.739
This is the bomb.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.020
What?

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.340
It's not carrying explosives,
the whole compartment is the bomb.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.099
We need bomb disposal.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.780
There may not be time for that now.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:06.940
So what do we do?

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.179
I have no idea.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:14.579
Well, think of something.
Why do you think I know what to do?

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.179
Cos you're Sherlock Holmes,
you're as clever as it gets.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.299
It doesn't mean I know how
to defuse a giant bomb!

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.259
What about you?! I wasn't in bomb
disposal, I'm a bloody doctor!

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.299
And a soldier,
as you keep reminding us all!

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.578
Can't... Can't we rip
the timer off, or something?

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.380
That would set it off.
You see, you know things!

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:51.339
Oh!

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.019
Er... My God!

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.660
Er...

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.059
Why didn't you call the police?!

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.259
Can you just...? Why do you
never call the police?!

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.380
Well, it's no use now.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.019
So you can't switch the bomb off?!

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.620
You can't switch the bomb off
and you didn't call the police!

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.738
Go, John. Go now!

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.618
There's no point now, is there,
because there's not enough time

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:18.180
to get away and if we don't do this,
other people will die!

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.899
Mind palace!

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:25.738
Hmm? Use your mind palace!

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.939
How will that help?

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:28.899
You've salted away
every fact under the sun!

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.749
And you think I've just
got "how to defuse a"

01:09:30.761 --> 01:09:32.580
"bomb" tucked away in
there somewhere?! Yes!

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.740
Maybe.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.538
Think!

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.100
Think, please think.

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.540
Think!

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.740
I can't!

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.060
Oh, my God!

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.340
This is it.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.740
Um, er...

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.739
Oh, my God!

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.819
Turn that off. Oh, God!

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.220
Er, um, er...

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.100
I'm sorry.

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.420
What?

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:28.379
I can't, I can't do it, John.

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.540
I don't know how.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.219
Forgive me.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.499
What?!

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.219
Please, John, forgive me,

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.539
for all the hurt that I caused you.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.459
No, no, no, no, no, no,
this is a trick. No.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.019
Another one of your bloody tricks.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.420
No. You're just trying
to make me say something nice.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:48.899
Not this time.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.060
It's just to make you look good
even though you've behaved like...

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.779
I wanted you not to be dead.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.780
Yeah, well, be careful
what you wish for.

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.580
If I hadn't come back,
you wouldn't be standing there and...

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.259
you'd still have a future,
with Mary.

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.180
Yeah, I know.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.579
Look, I find it difficult. I find
it difficult, this sort of stuff.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.900
I know.

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:44.220
You were the best and the wisest man
that I have ever known.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.220
Yes, of course I forgive you.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:08.539
The criminal network Moriarty
headed was vast.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:11.739
Its roots were everywhere, like a
cancer, so we came up with a plan.

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.899
Mycroft fed Moriarty
information about me.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.619
Moriarty, in turn, gave us hints,

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.139
just hints as to the extent
of his web.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.099
We let him go, because it was
important to let him believe

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.659
he had the upper hand.

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.459
And then, I sat back
and watched Moriarty

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.099
destroy my reputation, bit by bit.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:35.139
I had to make him
believe he'd beaten me,

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:37.899
utterly defeated me,
and then he'd show his hand.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:41.779
There were 13 likely scenarios
once we were up on that roof.

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:45.459
Each of them were rigorously worked
out and given a code name.

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:48.219
It wasn't just my reputation
that Moriarty needed to bury.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.739
I had to die.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.539
Sherlock!

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.899
You can have me arrested,
you can torture me,

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.019
you can do anything you like
with me,

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.659
but nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:05.659
Your only three friends
in the world will die, unless...

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:08.540
Unless I kill myself
and complete your story.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.459
You've got to admit that's sexier.

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.099
'But the one thing I didn't
anticipate was just how far

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.939
'Moriarty was prepared to go.
I suppose that was obvious,

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.379
'given our first meeting
at the swimming pool.

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.579
'His death wish.'

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.700
Argh!

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.819
'I knew I didn't have long.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:33.660
'I contacted my brother,
set the wheels in motion.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.820
'And then everyone got to work.'

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.540
'It's a trick.'

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.380
'It's just a magic trick.'

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.579
'All right, stop it now.'

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.500
'Now, stay exactly where you are.'

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.460
'Don't move!'

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.020
All right.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.300
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.140
Please, will you do this for me?

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:54.099
'It was vital that John stayed
just where I'd put him

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:57.819
'and that way his view was blocked
by the ambulance station.'

01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.380
Sherlock!

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:14.219
'I needed to hit the
air-bag, 'which I did.

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.899
'Speed was paramount.

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.019
'The air-bag needed to be got
out of the way

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.539
'just as John cleared the station.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.019
'But we needed him to see a body.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.539
'That's where Molly came in.

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:29.460
'Like figures on a weather clock, we
went one way, John went the other.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.700
'Then, our well-timed cyclist...'

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.899
'..put John briefly out of action,

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.540
'giving me time to switch places
with the corpse on the pavement.

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.660
'The rest was just window Dr..essing.'

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:02.739
'And one final touch,
a squash ball under the armpit.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.220
'Apply enough pressure and it
momentarily cuts off the pulse.'

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.179
Let me come through, please!

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.739
It's all right...
No, he's my friend.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.019
It's all right.
No, he's my friend.

01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:22.580
It's all right, it's all right...
He's my friend, please.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.579
Everything was anticipated,
every eventuality allowed for.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.259
It worked perfectly.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.259
Molly. Molly Hooper?
She was in on it?

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:45.100
Yes. You remember the little girl
who was abducted by Moriarty?

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.379
Get out!

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.219
'You assumed she reacted like that
because I was her kidnapper.'

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.739
But I deduced Moriarty must have
found someone who looked

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:56.379
very like me to plant suspicion,
and that that man, whoever he was,

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.379
had to be got out of the way
as soon as his usefulness ended.

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.659
That meant there was a corpse
in the morgue somewhere

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.819
that looked just like me.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.099
Clever.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.939
Molly found the body,
faked the records

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:08.419
and I provided the other coat.

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.939
I've got lots of coats.

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.739
What about the sniper
aiming at John?

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.299
Mycroft's men intervened before
he could take the shot.

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.820
He was invited to reconsider.

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:18.860
Is it done?

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:22.700
Good.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.099
And your homeless network?

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.499
As I explained,
the whole street was closed off.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
Like a scene from a play.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.259
Neat, don't you think?

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:37.539
Hmm... What?

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.099
Not the way I'd have done it.

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.459
Oh, really?

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.620
No, I'm not saying
it's not clever, but... What?

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.579
Bit... disappointed.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.460
Oh. Everyone's a critic.
Anyway, that's not why I came.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:57.179
No? No, I think you know
why I'm here, Phillip.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.060
"How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper?"

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.299
Didn't you think it was intriguing?

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:07.739
Lurid. A case so sensational
you hoped I'd be interested.

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.539
But you overdid it, Phillip.
You and your little fan-club.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.459
I just couldn't live with myself,
knowing that I'd Dr..iven you to...

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:19.659
But you didn't. You were
always right, I wasn't dead.

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.659
No. No, and everything's OK now,
isn't it?

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.260
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.539
Though of course you've
wasted police time.

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.459
Perverted the course of justice.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.299
Risked distracting me from a massive
terrorist assault that could have

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.179
both destroyed Parliament and caused
the death of hunDr..eds of people.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.139
Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm sorry,
Sherlock!

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.940
I'm so sorry.

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:48.980
Hang on.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.059
That doesn't make sense.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:56.459
How could you be sure John
would stand on that exact spot?

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.819
I mean, what if he'd moved?

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.659
And... how did you
do it all so quickly?

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:01.940
What if the bike hadn't hit him?

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.220
And anyway,
why are you telling me all this?

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:10.260
If you'd pulled that off, I'm the
last person you'd tell the truth to!

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.500
Sherlock Holmes!

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.939
You...
Oh, your face!

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.299
Utter... Your face!

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.459
You!

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.579
Totally had you!
You cock!

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:17.099
I knew it! I knew it! You... Oh, those
things you said, such sweet things.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.579
I never knew you cared. I will, I'll kill
you if you ever breathe a word of this...

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:23.219
Scout's honour.
..to anyone! You knew!

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.899
You knew how to turn it off!

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.299
There's an off switch.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.299
There's always an off switch.

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.579
Terrorists can get into
all sorts of probleMs..

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.139
Unless there's an off switch.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.859
So why did you let me go through
all that?! I didn't lie altogether.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:39.380
I've absolutely no idea how to turn
any of these silly little lights off.

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:46.579
And you did call the police?
Of course I called the police.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.459
I'm definitely going to kill you!

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:52.220
Oh, please. Killing me,
that's so two years ago.

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:33.699
'Sherlock, please, I beg of you.

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.299
'You can take over at the interval.'

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.659
Oh, I'm sorry, brother dear,
but you made a promise.

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.419
Nothing I can do to help.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:44.259
'But you don't understand
the pain of it, the horror.'

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.220
Come on, you'll have to go down,
they want the story.

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.340
In a minute.

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:54.579
I'm really pleased, Mary.
Have you set a date?

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.059
Well, we thought May.
Ah, a spring wedding. Yeah.

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.939
Well, once we've
actually got engaged. Yeah.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.379
We were interrupted last time.
Yeah. Well, I can't wait.

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.499
You will be there, Sherlock?

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.499
Weddings, not really my thing.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.579
Hello, everyone. Hello, Molly.

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:12.699
This is Tom.
Tom, this is everyone. Hi.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.099
Hi. It's really nice
to meet you all. Hi.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.099
Wow! Yeah, hi, I'm John,
good to meet you.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.220
Ready?
Ready.

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.540
Champagne?

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.300
Yes.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.499
Thanks.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.780
Thank you.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.579
Sit down, love. Oh, thanks.

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.780
So um...

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:46.939
Is it serious, you two?

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.460
Yeah. I've moved on.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.299
Did you...?

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.620
I'm not saying a word. No, best not.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.099
But I'm still waiting. Hmm?

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.299
Why did they try and kill me?

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.979
If they knew you were onto them,
why come after me?

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.659
Put me in a bonfire?

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.940
I don't know.
I don't like not knowing.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:13.459
Unlike the nicely embellished
fictions on your blog, John,

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.539
real life is rarely so neat.

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:19.139
I don't know who was behind
all this, but I will find out,

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:20.619
I promise you.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.379
Don't pretend
you're not enjoying this.

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:26.099
Hmm?
Being back. Being a hero again.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.619
Don't be stupid. You'd have
to be an idiot not to see it.

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.939
You love it. Love what?

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.620
Being Sherlock Holmes.

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.580
I don't even know what
that's supposed to mean.

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.140
Sherlock, you are going to tell me
how you did it?

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:45.019
How you jumped off
that building and survived?

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.579
You know my methods, John,
I am known to be indestructible.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.019
No, but seriously.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.739
When you were dead,
I went to your grave.

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.219
I should hope so.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:56.580
I made a little speech.

01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.659
I actually spoke to you.

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.460
I know. I was there.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.380
I asked you for one more miracle.

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:09.540
I asked you to stop being dead.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:13.300
I heard you.

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.900
Anyway, time to go
and be Sherlock Holmes.

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.140
'John!'

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.260
'John!'

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.220
'John!

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.780
'John!

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:33.580
'John!'
