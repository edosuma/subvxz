WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:07.408
This time next week,
y'all gonna be practicing

00:07.441 --> 00:09.110
inside this new building right here.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.778
Previously in P-Valley...

00:11.011 --> 00:12.513
You made the withdrawal
from the church account yet?

00:12.546 --> 00:15.416
What you need it for?
What's your little ass gonna do with it?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.617
My gym.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.186
This retirement plan of yours,
it's real, huh?

00:19.220 --> 00:22.523
Mercedes' last dance...
it took you long enough.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.626
Well, 25 retirement age
for a stripper nowadays?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.595
Hey, yo, Cliff. Come listen to this.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.363
Nigga, is you stalking me?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.664
Yeah, shorty. Listen to this here.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.333
New song, huh?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.734
Who this Andre Watkins?

00:33.768 --> 00:35.302
I was just showing him a good time.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.271
By trying to bribe him with the stacks?

00:37.304 --> 00:39.440
His casino want to buy our land.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.142
I'm gonna need you to use them lips.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.611
And I'll leave it up
to you to decide which set you gonna use.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.248
- Condom?
- Be right back.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.787
Luckily, there's a Walgreens on the co...

00:54.555 --> 00:56.323
Fuck.

00:56.357 --> 01:00.761
I think I might just have to try you out
on that pulpit one Sunday service.

01:00.795 --> 01:04.064
That would be nice.

01:10.538 --> 01:14.642
I just don't see why I should pay you
to take your clothes off for money.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.646
It's like giving a homeless man
a million dollars.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.682
You already know
that ain't gonna turn out right.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.718
- What's popping, Freckles?
- That ain't my name.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.454
But that's what make you distinct.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.788
Another thing make you distinct

01:27.822 --> 01:30.324
is that you the only nigga up
in here not throwing it up.

01:30.825 --> 01:33.227
I got money. Money ain't a thing.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.229
It makes my skin crawl
to see all these women here

01:35.262 --> 01:36.263
degrading themselves like that.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.865
Get your ass here on a weeknight

01:38.098 --> 01:39.767
'cause you ain't got
no pussy to park up in.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.335
I don't like the way you talking to me.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.437
And I don't like your freckles,
so that make us even.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.672
You probably ain't even got no money.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.140
I got some money. That ain't...

01:46.173 --> 01:49.143
Well, give it to her, then.
Imagine she homeless, and you Jesus.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.315
Pick that shit up.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.750
It's okay. We'll get Toy to pick it up.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.223
- Hand it to the lady.
- A lady?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.791
Man, y'all got jokes.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.494
I only repeat myself once.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.529
Hand the lady the money.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.864
Jump if you gonna jump, nigga.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.504
You gonna be disrespectful, huh?

02:16.537 --> 02:19.807
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.476
Okay, okay, okay.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.830
Fuck that nigga.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.699
He gonna be the first one
busting a nut to some porn tonight.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.668
At least we ain't doing that.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.869
What if he right?

02:48.903 --> 02:51.572
Look, Keyshawn...

02:52.473 --> 02:55.376
...if you don't learn
nothing from me, learn this.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.945
Don't let not one nigga
put his weight up on you.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.680
If he feels some type of way
about this shit,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.482
then he don't need to be up in here, then.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.751
Maybe I feel some type of way
about it, too.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.346
Sorry.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.882
A customer spilled beer on my money.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.486
Must be going good down at the Pynk.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.855
You know how fellas go crazy
for the new girl.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.892
Don't me and my husband know it.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.535
This gonna be
the spot for all my trophies.

06:09.436 --> 06:13.006
Girl, you must make a mean rack of ribs
if they all award-winning.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.109
I'm not doing a restaurant.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.411
I'm doing myself a gym.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.912
A gym?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.482
These fat folk
in Chucalissa sure need one,

06:21.515 --> 06:23.584
not that we gonna use it, though.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.918
Not that kind of gym.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.453
It's a gym for majorettes.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.922
We need somewhere
to practice our dance-dance.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.759
And what kind of money
you make doing that?

06:31.792 --> 06:33.127
I'ma charge tuition, so...

06:33.160 --> 06:34.728
I already got about 20 girls.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.897
I get a gym, I'm sure I'll bring in more.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.766
And folks spend money on that?

06:38.799 --> 06:39.900
What you mean?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.102
I mean, it ain't like nothing you can buy.

06:42.136 --> 06:45.639
You ain't selling a product.
You just selling an experience.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.143
Believe me, if it's one thing
I know how to sell,

06:49.176 --> 06:51.011
it's a experience.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.713
It's a subscription model I'm going for.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.815
Subscription model? Okay.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.117
You pay a monthly fee

06:57.151 --> 06:59.787
and get access to a bunch
of different classes.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.189
You see, I want my girls
to build up they skill set.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.691
Folks that's good enough can become
a Chucalissa Challenger.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.795
20 girls at $200
more than pays for the mortgage.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.696
It sure sound risky.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.599
Listen, maybe I should show you
some of my rental properties.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.768
A lease will give you some time
to see how it all shake out.

07:14.802 --> 07:18.639
No, I'm committed to this.
I'm committed to these girls.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.107
I'ma build something that lasts.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.913
Okay, you get me
the down payment by tomorrow?

07:25.946 --> 07:26.980
Tomorrow?

07:27.014 --> 07:30.484
These folks been buying up these
properties left and right around town.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.020
You better put your money down quick
before somebody else do.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.721
Okay, I will.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.825
Just a little piece of business advice.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.661
I'd up that subscription fee to $250.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.095
Dreams are expensive.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.097
Make them pay for what it's worth.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.080
What the hell?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.615
Ooh-whee, girl.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.917
I don't need no crack
with a voice like that.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.786
You don't have to give me your money.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.087
Where you going to church, huh?

08:07.120 --> 08:08.889
I'ma come and hear you every Sunday.

08:19.166 --> 08:23.036
Ms. Woodbine, are you sure you want
to close this account?

08:23.070 --> 08:25.205
I'm just following God's orders.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.740
Had to ask.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.653
Could you hurry the hell up!

08:39.686 --> 08:41.922
You have a blessed fucking day, too!

08:42.756 --> 08:43.757
Bitch.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.967
- I can't.
- Hell, you better.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.670
You damn near split your wig
the other night.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.006
Uncle Clifford said your ass
is gonna get up on the Pony,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.607
you got to learn how to ride.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.943
Now, one more again.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.624
I just don't have the upper-body strength
to do this shit.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.159
It ain't about strength.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.761
It's about physics.

09:20.794 --> 09:21.995
You got to think of it like this.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.698
The Pony is the center of the universe.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.969
In order to go around,
you got to throw your weight.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.753
Flying ain't about strength.
It's about trust.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.355
Y'all up in here?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.223
Who hooptie parked in the parking lot?

09:50.257 --> 09:51.758
- Mine.
- What?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
You ain't driving no Lexus?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.795
That's all I could afford.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.064
Gidget, you ready to go on
down to the Dollar Tree?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.599
I got coupons for the sparklers.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.934
Hey!

10:00.968 --> 10:03.837
Mercedes' last dance finna be lit.

10:04.671 --> 10:05.806
Where Uncle Clifford at?

10:05.839 --> 10:09.109
Uncle Clifford! Uncle Clifford!

10:09.142 --> 10:11.678
Keyshawn, quit calling my name.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.714
Uncle Clifford, could you please...

10:13.747 --> 10:14.982
No.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.684
This ain't no damn
Uncle Pooh Bear daycare.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.854
Take your baby on to the store with you.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.791
Lookie here.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.660
This my new little trinity, huh?

10:28.161 --> 10:30.297
This little look look like it might work.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.333
Me and Gidget a duo now, salt and pepper.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.102
Hey!

10:35.135 --> 10:37.871
Shake it. Don't break it now.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.640
Come on in this office, September October.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.942
I got something I want to show you.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.877
What you say?

10:44.978 --> 10:48.181
Yeah. Yeah, what you say?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.350
Okay.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.052
Come on, now, look...

10:59.126 --> 11:01.862
Girl, you ain't hear this from me.

11:01.895 --> 11:05.332
Uncle Clifford was in the Paradise Room
with all them regulars the other night.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.103
That man said a casino coming to town
want to build over the Pynk.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.371
What?

11:11.405 --> 11:13.740
Wait a minute. How you hear this, now?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.175
I overheard during
my Sleeping Beauty night.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.310
Bless his heart.
That doctor know he a nutter.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.913
- Girl, I know.
- Well, they can't do that.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.848
Uncle Clifford
ain't gonna let them do that.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.718
Sounded like Uncle Clifford
ain't got much choice in the matter.

11:29.289 --> 11:33.093
Now, I dids me a deep dive
from them pictures to the memos.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.128
Seem like folks last name
Jenkins getting half

11:35.162 --> 11:37.330
what the Trumps getting,
you know what I'm saying?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.800
I mean, Corbin and them land
worth a half a million,

11:39.833 --> 11:42.069
yet they nearly getting about six.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.770
Well, what they offer you?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.472
They ain't given me no offer.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.107
What?

11:47.140 --> 11:50.043
- Don't tell me you don't own.
- No, I own. I own.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.712
This place been passed down
over the generations.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.047
It's just...

11:54.081 --> 11:56.049
I'm still paying off a debt
I took up on this place.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.184
And you gotten behind.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.986
Well, I won't be behind for long.

12:00.020 --> 12:04.724
Mercedes' last dance
gonna have that interstate lit as fuck.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.094
Her booty always bring in that big bank

12:07.127 --> 12:08.195
and little bank, too.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.466
You'll never be able to beat them,
even if you get good on your debt.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.801
They'll find a way to take this club.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.970
I know guys like this.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.473
They always win.

12:22.809 --> 12:23.977
Child.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.814
I loves to be taken in the night, but...

12:28.515 --> 12:31.785
I feel like my booty hole
gonna be tore up after this.

12:31.818 --> 12:32.953
What you said.

12:36.256 --> 12:40.994
Unless somebody can prepare me
for the rapture.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.297
Come on.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.801
That Andre boy love running
his mouth off to you.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.203
You know, go back to him,
ask him a couple more questions.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.538
No. No, no.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.875
I am not talking
to that creepy-ass dude anymore.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.811
You know he has pictures of me
on his computer?

12:57.844 --> 12:59.312
Bitch...

12:59.346 --> 13:02.516
He got pictures of me on that computer.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.851
You ain't nobody special.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.861
And here it is you think
that man's stalking you.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.199
Your pussy ain't that good.

13:30.443 --> 13:34.581
As you can see, the nighttime foot traffic
is high on the weekends,

13:34.814 --> 13:39.319
and with access to the 55
and being waterfront property,

13:39.352 --> 13:41.021
this property is A1 for sure.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.090
Andre, stellar work pinning
this down for the company.

13:44.124 --> 13:48.094
Well, with Mississippi state law
requiring all casinos be built on water,

13:48.128 --> 13:49.863
viable land is scarce,

13:49.896 --> 13:51.998
but I've found needles
in haystacks before.

13:52.032 --> 13:56.036
Now, to be clear, we're still on track
with the other land acquisitions?

13:56.069 --> 13:59.439
The Kyle property is one signature away
from being done and done.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.340
Perfect.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.210
I can't believe this is coming along
without a hitch.

14:03.243 --> 14:08.915
Well, Bill, there might be
one small, little, tiny problem

14:08.949 --> 14:10.517
- with the owner of the Pynk.
- Nigga.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.220
Now, the Pynk is still
on the verge of foreclosure,

14:13.253 --> 14:15.889
but the owner may have found out
about the casino.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.458
I know we were waiting
till the foreclosure proceedings

14:18.491 --> 14:20.026
were done with the Pynk,

14:20.060 --> 14:22.529
but I say we make the man
an offer he can't refuse.

14:22.562 --> 14:26.233
There's no point in making an offer
if he's about to go on the auction block.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.970
Damn. Well, you white folks...

14:30.003 --> 14:31.338
No, no, no, Mayor Ruffin...

14:31.371 --> 14:33.573
You bold in it nowadays, don't you?

14:33.607 --> 14:35.408
I did not mean it like that.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.077
I'm sorry, but I am...

14:37.110 --> 14:39.279
You took that the wrong way.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.448
Unfortunately,
if we can't get all the land

14:41.481 --> 14:44.117
at the price point allotted in our budget,

14:44.150 --> 14:46.953
then Promised Land
will be forced to go elsewhere.

14:47.621 --> 14:52.592
Now, now, Bill,
let's not get ahead of ourselves.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.229
Chucalissa want this, need this.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.099
Well, then, Mayor Ruffin,
what are you gonna do

14:59.132 --> 15:01.101
to make sure that Promised Land Equities

15:01.134 --> 15:05.572
can do more than just build
the Tydell Ruffin Park?

15:06.473 --> 15:07.641
My...

15:10.143 --> 15:13.480
...office can draw up a special ordinance

15:13.513 --> 15:16.549
to expedite this particular foreclosure.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.119
Just give me two weeks.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.354
Then that ain't gonna be
a problem no more.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.157
Mr. Watkins,
close the Kyle deal without delay.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.026
- Two weeks, gentlemen.
- Bill, let's go!

15:26.059 --> 15:27.994
- Two weeks.
- Got to get back to my wife.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.329
Eloise...

15:32.165 --> 15:35.502
...can you go get me a, you know...

15:37.037 --> 15:39.272
- Get you a what?
- Bitch, just go!

15:46.479 --> 15:49.149
I'm surprised Eloise ain't sued you yet.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.685
Boy, hush. This is the South.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.487
I just want to know

15:54.521 --> 15:57.691
what the hell you were doing just then.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.527
I had to let Bill know.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.495
I seen shit like this go sideways,

16:02.529 --> 16:04.531
you don't keep your investors
privy to potential problems.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.600
No, the problem was you doing
a deal in the Pynk

16:07.634 --> 16:10.070
with that Corbin motherfucking Kyle.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.206
He probably the one that told
that thing about the casino.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.974
Probably.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.610
You stay your ass up out
of that Pussy Valley.

16:17.644 --> 16:22.182
That whole hood is known for loose lips,
if you know what I'm saying.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.652
You wanted me to close the Kyle deal
by any means necessary.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.387
That's what I was down
at the Pynk trying to do.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.156
No, no, no, you were trying
to fuck up my legacy.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.459
If this thing goes through,
I will be the man

16:32.492 --> 16:38.331
that singlehandedly make it rain
down upon Chucalissa,

16:38.365 --> 16:41.701
and my platform is a promise

16:41.735 --> 16:43.703
I intend to keep.

16:43.737 --> 16:48.208
Now, you close
that motherfucking Kyle sale

16:48.241 --> 16:50.210
by end of week.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.244
You heard me?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.080
I heard you.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.519
Well, come on, get it done, godson.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.222
Get it done.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.058
I'll deal with that Clifford sale.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.130
And, you...

17:10.163 --> 17:12.766
you just keep your dick up out that Pynk.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.069
Siri, call Patrice.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.772
Hey, Ma.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.473
You have reached Patrice Woodbine.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.375
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now,

17:22.409 --> 17:25.612
so please leave a message
and have a blessed day.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.416
Hey, Ma, this is about
the third time I done called.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.085
Let me know where you gonna be at
so I can come cop that check.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.286
Hit me back, now.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.653
Hello. You have reached the phone of...

18:06.686 --> 18:09.789
She can't come to the phone right now
because she's on punishment.

18:09.823 --> 18:13.126
- Mom!
- You can call back in three weeks.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.295
Oh, my God, you're doing it!

18:17.297 --> 18:22.235
I know I've been changed

18:22.268 --> 18:27.841
I know I've been changed

18:30.510 --> 18:32.545
Come on, Delta Valley Revival.

18:33.179 --> 18:36.449
Who else wants to come
to the altar tonight?

18:36.483 --> 18:39.419
Who else wants to be delivered?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.454
I know I do.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.723
Do you hear me, church?

18:43.756 --> 18:47.894
You see, your steps have been ordered

18:48.127 --> 18:50.163
by the Lord Himself,

18:50.196 --> 18:51.865
the path that you're on

18:51.898 --> 18:55.335
with its twists and turns.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.170
Its highs

18:57.203 --> 19:00.540
And low lows

19:00.573 --> 19:02.509
Let me hear you say amen
if you been deep...

19:02.542 --> 19:05.778
- Amen!
- Down in the valley

19:07.547 --> 19:10.850
And can't no man take

19:10.884 --> 19:13.419
What God got for you

19:13.453 --> 19:14.721
You gonna hear this!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.856
Can't no man take

19:16.890 --> 19:19.559
What God got for you

19:19.592 --> 19:20.927
Amen. Thank you, Sister Woodbine.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.163
Pastor Gilfield know... Isaiah 54.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.799
Won't no weapon formed
against you prosper,

19:26.833 --> 19:30.537
and every tongue that dare rise
against you in judgment,

19:30.570 --> 19:33.673
in hypocrisy, in both hateration and...

19:33.706 --> 19:37.544
Holleration

19:37.577 --> 19:39.312
Will be condemned

19:44.183 --> 19:46.719
I could dance all night

20:09.842 --> 20:11.611
What in Heaven names you think you doing?

20:11.644 --> 20:14.514
Wasn't it you that said you wanted
to try me out in the pulpit,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.649
or is that something you tell
all your church hos?

20:16.683 --> 20:18.518
Don't blaspheme in front of me.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.486
Nigga, you ain't God.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.888
But this is my church,

20:21.921 --> 20:24.390
and a woman ain't got
no place on the pulpit.

20:24.424 --> 20:28.294
Seem like your congregation
might think otherwise.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.464
Stay in your lane, Sister Patrice...

20:32.732 --> 20:34.968
...or you best find another church.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.615
Now, how come you ain't coming tomorrow?

20:48.648 --> 20:50.750
You know I'd be there if I could.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.318
But the season start tomorrow night.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.324
Don't be mad at me,
because I got you something new.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.801
Only dollar bills can go in the floss.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.337
Go ahead and open it. Go on ahead.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.652
That's all I get?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.320
You know you can get more.

21:42.368 --> 21:43.870
That's really up to you.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.377
- Hey, boo.
- Hey, girl.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.081
- That's 25 cents.
- Call y'all bitch.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.449
Yo, Peanut Butter,

21:56.482 --> 21:58.317
Extra Extra,

21:58.351 --> 22:00.853
and the Dark Knight, y'all on deck.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.690
Uncle Cliff, remember,
Autumn ain't working tonight.

22:03.723 --> 22:07.093
Well, y'all lucky, 'cause that girl was
gonna take all y'all bitches' money.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.698
Look, tonight might be slow,
but don't y'all worry.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.467
With Mercedes' last dance,
tomorrow'll be better.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.736
Y'all just put my monkey drops
in y'all routines, now.

22:16.769 --> 22:20.373
How many monkey drops it gonna take
to keep this place from shutting down?

22:20.406 --> 22:22.375
- Shutting down? Who said that?
- Yeah, who?

22:22.408 --> 22:24.110
- Who said that?
- Yeah, who?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.011
Who?

22:25.044 --> 22:28.381
If y'all bitches don't stop sounding
like some motherfucking owls up in here,

22:28.414 --> 22:29.415
y'all better...

22:31.584 --> 22:35.054
I overheard you talking to Autumn's man
the other night in the Paradise Room...

22:35.088 --> 22:38.491
said a casino finna to tear down the Pynk.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.394
Well, Miss Mississippi,

22:41.427 --> 22:46.065
you sure named after the right river,
'cause your ass can't hold water for shit.

22:46.099 --> 22:49.435
Thank God it's all just lies and gossip.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.971
Well, if that ain't true,
what the hell's going on?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.677
Damn. I ain't gone yet.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.812
Save the tears
for my floss funeral tomorrow.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.881
Mercedes, this ain't even funny.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.850
The Pynk finna shut down.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.085
Girl, it ain't finna close.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.420
Uncle Clifford just a little behind.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.688
Wait, you knew about this shit?

23:13.559 --> 23:14.861
Look, look, look.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.596
Y'all heifers just go on out here.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.431
- Let's make this money.
- Bitch, come on, let's go.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.465
Hooch on.

23:20.466 --> 23:21.467
Go.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.577
So you fucking knew
this place was going under,

23:31.611 --> 23:33.446
and you ain't even tell nobody?

23:33.479 --> 23:36.449
Hell, and if it was, ain't like you'd do
something different.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.484
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

23:38.518 --> 23:39.786
Gidget, I loves you, girl,

23:39.819 --> 23:41.754
but you be blowing
through your bags like dandelions.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.556
At least I squares my shit away.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.792
Yeah, that's easy when you just got
a fucking dog to take care of.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.860
Ain't nobody told you to have
all them kids, Keyshawn.

23:47.894 --> 23:51.097
I been telling y'all from day one,
stack your paper.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.965
What's the point of working
here if you ain't saving?

23:52.999 --> 23:55.802
Bitch, you walk around here
with your head so far up your own ass,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.136
you don't know what we doing.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.971
I know y'all been buying bags and Louises

23:59.005 --> 24:00.973
and eating out every day and shit
while I've been stacking.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.675
Seven years I stacked.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.912
And I finally got my gym.

24:05.945 --> 24:06.946
Your gym?

24:08.014 --> 24:10.683
What, the club ain't good enough for you?

24:10.716 --> 24:12.185
It's good enough for me.

24:13.085 --> 24:16.656
Girl, your mammy will tell you

24:16.689 --> 24:18.124
you can't strip forever.

24:21.194 --> 24:22.528
Gidget, wait.

24:23.863 --> 24:26.199
Bitch, like, that was a fucking low blow.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.202
Gidge!

24:36.042 --> 24:37.043
Andre.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.216
What, the honey pot ain't working tonight?

24:44.951 --> 24:47.053
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.789
What you did, digging through
my computer like that,

24:49.822 --> 24:51.691
sending my files around
to God knows who...

24:51.724 --> 24:54.760
You're right. I shouldn't have done that.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.530
Look, I'm here to tell you I'm sorry.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.265
Sorry you tried
to smash me for some intel?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.266
No.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.735
I wanted to be with you, Andre.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.737
It's just...

25:05.738 --> 25:07.707
Clifford really needed to know, and...

25:08.641 --> 25:10.209
...and then I saw the picture
you took of me.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.545
Look, it was for my presentation.

25:12.578 --> 25:16.048
Yeah, I saw it, in the PowerPoint,
the one about land appraisal.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.817
Jesus. This shit can't get out.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.685
People need to know
they're being screwed over, Andre.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.920
Yeah, they sure do.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.723
Good night, Hailey.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.559
Why are you so mad?

25:26.592 --> 25:28.160
This is supposed to be
a good thing, right?

25:28.194 --> 25:29.896
That's what you said, it was gonna turn
the whole town around.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.864
Nothing will turn
this whole town around, Hailey!

25:31.898 --> 25:34.100
Bu t at least if I could just push
this casino development through,

25:34.133 --> 25:36.102
I could do more for this city, my city.

25:36.769 --> 25:40.239
And just to think,
I jeopardized all that for a...

25:40.273 --> 25:41.774
a stripper.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.712
You don't know who the fuck I am.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.215
Yeah, and now I don't want to know.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.751
You know what?

25:51.784 --> 25:53.319
I'd rather be a stripper

25:53.552 --> 25:55.855
than some self-righteous,
hypocritical bastard

25:55.888 --> 25:59.091
who thinks he's been put
on God's green earth to save us all.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.794
'Cause Captain Save-a-Ho
gonna save us all, right?

26:01.827 --> 26:02.862
Why are you even here?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.730
Go back to your kid. Put him to bed.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.966
Be a responsible mother
instead of some thot

26:06.999 --> 26:08.935
ready to finesse the next thirsty nigga!

26:13.706 --> 26:14.774
Fuck you.

26:15.641 --> 26:19.612
Fuck you, fuck you, Andre! Fuck! Fuck you!

26:20.313 --> 26:21.280
Stop.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.749
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.651
Hey, hey.

27:07.693 --> 27:08.861
Coffee?

27:09.395 --> 27:12.031
So you didn't want to sleep
next to my crazy ass?

27:12.865 --> 27:13.733
Nah.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.703
Nah, I couldn't anyway.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.007
I was up thinking a lot
about what happened.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.209
What almost happened.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.894
My daughter is gone, Andre.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.801
Hailey, I'm so sorry.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.337
It seem like all the scars

27:51.370 --> 27:54.040
are still more like open wounds, though.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.850
I'ma get going.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.094
Hey.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.100
She's lucky.

29:46.018 --> 29:51.323
Tonight's the night my girl Mercedes
goes HAM on that pole for the last time.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.126
Get your motherfucking chips,

29:54.160 --> 29:56.362
'cause we breaking all the rules tonight.

29:59.865 --> 30:03.002
Hey, you need to go straight on
to Mercedes.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.003
You already know, man.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.337
As soon as she hear
how nice this track slaps,

30:05.371 --> 30:06.572
she gonna be begging to twerk to it.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.806
Watch.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.409
Now, I know y'all see the line.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.511
I'm VIP up in this bitch tonight, man.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.580
You best take
your little swoll-in-the-chest ass

30:14.813 --> 30:17.516
to the back of that line
before I break your fucking mouth, nigga,

30:17.550 --> 30:19.251
with your cheap-ass grill.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.453
Hey, it's okay. It's okay, Diamond.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.055
They can come on in.

30:25.558 --> 30:27.393
Yeah, it's cool.

30:38.404 --> 30:39.838
It's all right.

31:00.426 --> 31:03.495
Flodging-ass, femme-fatale-looking bitch,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.864
walking like she carrying
ten stacks on her.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.504
- Hey, Ma.
- You have reached Patrice Woodbine.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.640
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now,

31:14.873 --> 31:18.410
so please leave a message
and have a blessed day.

31:18.444 --> 31:22.414
The mailbox is full and cannot accept
any messages at this time.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.616
Good-bye.

31:50.643 --> 31:52.311
Fine. Shit.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.246
Here y'all bitches go.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.482
I hope you washed them.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.151
Bitch, you'd be lucky to get
some of my pussy juice on your shit.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.177
Who did done this and fucked up
my mascara?

33:13.559 --> 33:16.562
You are fucking this shit up tonight.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.530
- Shining on all of us.
- Yes.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.566
- Gidget, thank...
- I'm on deck.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.735
Damn.

33:23.569 --> 33:26.338
This bitch still up in her feelings.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.476
Well, you right.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.746
When you've been stacking like you...

33:33.779 --> 33:35.414
Got you a gym.

33:36.749 --> 33:39.051
What if this casino thing go down?

33:39.084 --> 33:41.387
Where I'ma work at? What I'ma do?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.357
What you want to do.

33:46.759 --> 33:48.727
I ain't like you.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.030
You don't care what nobody think of you.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.333
You... you're strong.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.768
I'm just pretty.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.737
That's my only strength.

33:58.771 --> 34:00.205
Because it's your last chance

34:00.239 --> 34:05.244
to see the last dance
from your favorite, Mercedes!

34:05.277 --> 34:06.612
Time for the show.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.285
Y'all better get close to the stage.
Y'all better hurry up.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.535
I can't just play it on her
like I did last time.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.270
It's her retirement dance, too?

34:31.303 --> 34:34.473
Shit, one them cheap fuck cheap shooters
probably in the parking lot for sure.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.608
Come on, stop being a punk-ass bitch, man.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.277
Fuck wrong with you?

34:38.310 --> 34:40.312
Maybe I could play it
some other time of the night.

34:40.345 --> 34:42.614
No, Mercedes got to be
the one to bless the track.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.817
- That's what I need.
- Well, you better do what you do, then.

34:54.793 --> 34:58.664
We about to get fucked up tonight.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.469
The Pynk crunk as a mug, man.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.372
So many folk in here, the walls
gonna start sweating and shit.

35:54.186 --> 35:56.688
What judge done let you off
house arrest tonight?

35:58.557 --> 36:00.893
I told you
about that little fat motherfucker.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.596
He at the house right now,
putting the ankle bracelet to bed.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.599
Mane, you really came out for your girl?

36:07.633 --> 36:10.402
I wouldn't miss this shit
for the world, Mercedes.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.374
To new beginnings.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.411
New beginnings.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.516
Hey, Mercedes, can I talk
to you for a second?

36:24.550 --> 36:27.219
- Hey, little nigga.
- No, he straight.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.624
You ain't got no business stepping to her,

36:32.658 --> 36:36.194
especially with them ugly-ass
Christmas tree colors you rocking.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.530
Nigga, I was rocking Gucci.
The fuck you talking about?

36:38.564 --> 36:42.935
Mane, it's all right.
Lil Murda, speak your piece.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.704
To keep it 100, Mercedes,

36:45.737 --> 36:47.539
I just wanted to wish you
a beautiful night, shorty,

36:47.573 --> 36:50.576
and the best of luck with everything.

36:50.609 --> 36:51.810
You gonna be missed.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.446
Y'all have a good night.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.785
The audacity
of these young gangsters today, man.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.755
These hurt-billy hustlers
don't know how to follow code.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.321
Look out now. What's happening?

37:37.389 --> 37:38.957
I got something for you.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.659
Compliments of the coach.

37:43.328 --> 37:44.329
Good looking out.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.332
Get that baby some new Penny Hardaways
and make them crispy now.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.835
Make a memory with me.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.308
Now, don't forget to tag me
on that book of faces, all right?

37:56.341 --> 37:57.342
I won't.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.684
So this your last time up in this office?

38:08.020 --> 38:09.588
You need me to stay longer?

38:11.390 --> 38:14.026
Girl, don't be trying to stay
where your ass ain't wanted.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.494
Are you throwing me out now?

38:15.527 --> 38:16.695
Huh?

38:18.664 --> 38:21.333
That's what a boss bitch does...

38:21.366 --> 38:22.701
throw out baby birds.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.874
Now turn around.

38:36.415 --> 38:38.850
And that's exactly how I want
to remember your ass.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.593
Ma.

38:49.561 --> 38:50.629
Hello?

38:51.396 --> 38:52.064
Ma.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.566
No, don't come to the club.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.069
Meet me next to the Kroger.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.571
Be there. I'ma be there in a minute.

39:00.072 --> 39:03.108
That locker's gonna be looking
for a new owner after tonight.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.746
You know why the OG's locker
is the biggest locker in the room?

39:07.779 --> 39:09.481
- Why?
- 'Cause she earned it.

39:10.582 --> 39:13.618
Don't think your ass gonna get this locker
without putting in the work.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.555
Your little high yellow ass gonna have
to start doing monkey drops at least.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.790
Well, Gidget's been teaching me
a few tricks.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.095
Any parting words of advice?

39:24.396 --> 39:25.397
Yeah.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.099
Always clock the exits up in this bitch.

39:27.132 --> 39:30.102
You never know when you might have to turn
a closed door into a window.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.438
Don't you mean
a closed window into a door?

39:34.606 --> 39:36.441
Bitch, I said what I said.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.110
Well...

39:40.612 --> 39:43.482
Don't get cut trying
to climb your way back in.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.019
Midnight's almost here.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.432
I ain't like that shit.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.400
- It's cool, it's cool.
- No, I better go talk to her.

40:02.434 --> 40:03.101
It's all right.

40:03.135 --> 40:06.037
Pico, sit your ass down.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.940
At the end of the day,
a bitch gonna be a bitch.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.142
You got that right.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.645
Wait, why are so high-key right now?

40:13.678 --> 40:16.081
- Why you being this punk?
- I ain't nobody punk.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.449
Shit.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.651
You everybody punk from what I heard.

40:25.824 --> 40:26.825
Somebody, please!

40:26.858 --> 40:30.896

- Murda. Murda!

40:30.929 --> 40:32.597
Stop! You gonna kill him!

40:40.939 --> 40:43.675
Nigga, you is dead to me! Dead!

40:44.676 --> 40:46.478
Bitch-ass nigga. Yeah.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.988
- Hey.
- Hey, girl. Hey.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.690
Mama said she'd meet me
right here in a few minutes.

40:58.723 --> 40:59.825
She coming through with the check.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.794
I'm sorry, baby, but another buyer's done
already swooped in and got it.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.230
I told you, these properties been selling
around here like hoecakes.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.832
No, no, no, but my mama's
coming with the deposit.

41:06.865 --> 41:07.866
I promise.

41:09.201 --> 41:10.502
Ma?

41:12.003 --> 41:13.972
Wait, that's your mama?

41:14.706 --> 41:15.974
Oh, hell.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.046
What the hell is going on?

41:22.047 --> 41:24.015
I've been praying all day on this.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.651
I've been praying all my life, in fact,

41:26.685 --> 41:29.554
and today He finally showed me the way.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.790
Ma, we ain't got time
for your motherfucking sermons now.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.825
Why are you coming out of my gym?

41:33.859 --> 41:36.094
What? You didn't already put
my stacks down?

41:36.127 --> 41:39.998
No, I put that money down
for my new church building.

41:43.134 --> 41:44.536
No, no, no.

41:44.569 --> 41:45.971
But this gonna be my gym.

41:46.004 --> 41:49.040
No, this gonna be my church.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.877
Mercedes, God spoke to me,

41:51.910 --> 41:54.546
told me I was deserving of a pulpit.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.715
A feather hit me
like a ton of bricks today.

41:56.748 --> 41:57.849
It was a sign.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.253
You stole all...

42:02.754 --> 42:04.890
...my money?

42:04.923 --> 42:06.925
Well, God showed me the way.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.668
Fuck you, bitch!

42:16.701 --> 42:19.204
Fuck you! Bitch, you gonna...

42:22.974 --> 42:24.876
Hold your horses.

42:24.910 --> 42:27.245
And hold on to your weaves, now.

42:27.279 --> 42:30.081
You know, we just having
a few little technical difficulties.

42:31.616 --> 42:36.288
Hey, and meanwhile, DJ Neva Scared
is gonna play y'all some bangers

42:36.321 --> 42:37.589
before we start the show.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.858
Mercedes, Mercedes...

42:52.170 --> 42:53.672
Where is this bitch at?

42:53.705 --> 42:56.908
We've been calling and calling and calling
and still no answer.

42:56.942 --> 42:58.343
Something done happened to her.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.178
Gidget, quit, quit.

43:00.211 --> 43:02.113
We ain't got time
for them white-girl tears,

43:02.147 --> 43:04.282
though they are very tasty.

43:04.316 --> 43:05.951
Hey.

43:05.984 --> 43:06.985
Hey.

43:08.653 --> 43:11.723
The show must go on, hear?

43:12.324 --> 43:16.828
All right, now, which one of y'all heifers

43:16.861 --> 43:19.164
- Shit, I would.
- Okay.

43:20.332 --> 43:22.600
But I just ate them lemon-pepper wings.

43:22.634 --> 43:27.138
Girl, well, I guess I'm just gonna have
to go on and entertain these niggas

43:27.172 --> 43:28.740
with my little titties and fat ass.

43:28.773 --> 43:30.709
I don't know what y'all gonna do.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.177
Fucking God damn it.

43:33.011 --> 43:34.012
I'll do it.

43:36.181 --> 43:37.182
You sure?

43:38.183 --> 43:40.018
It's lots of people out there.

43:40.051 --> 43:42.187
Yeah, I'm sure.

43:44.723 --> 43:46.358
Come on, bitch. Come on.

I regret to inform you...

44:00.705 --> 44:02.007
Where the fuck this bitch Mercedes?

44:02.040 --> 44:03.375
We been waiting more than an hour.

44:04.943 --> 44:07.045
Mercedes will not be performing tonight.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.214
Hey, hey!

44:12.917 --> 44:15.086
But I got y'all...

44:15.120 --> 44:16.187

Hey, prove it, then.

49:54.559 --> 49:56.694
Two black female suspects in custody.

49:56.728 --> 49:58.396
Taking statements from witnesses.
