run of the mill.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.520
Or something familiar.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.231
If that's what you're into.

34:29.777 --> 34:32.484
Don't you see?
I can help you.

34:33.030 --> 34:36.363
We were meant
to do this together.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.575
l underestimated you.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.745
You really are
extraordinary.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.583
Just like me.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.172
(GROANS)

34:54.635 --> 34:58.344
You were right.
I am gonna get
my abilities back.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.346
Starting with yours.

35:01.517 --> 35:02.882
(GROANING)

35:12.236 --> 35:14.852
So this is what
you really look like.

35:17.950 --> 35:21.067
So silly trying
to be something
that you're not.

35:22.121 --> 35:25.454
Well, Michelle, or Candice,
or whoever you are,

35:25.541 --> 35:27.782
it wasn't all for nothing.

35:27.876 --> 35:32.165
Thanks to you,
I'll be going back
to Maui now.

35:43.684 --> 35:44.924
London.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.020
Japan.

35:51.608 --> 35:52.859
Japan!

(GROANING)

35:54.820 --> 35:56.321
(PANTING)

35:57.239 --> 36:00.322
It's not working.
I don't have it.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.819
(SNARLING) Your power.
What's wrong with me?

36:23.432 --> 36:25.263
(BIRD SQUAWKING)

36:32.441 --> 36:34.102
(PETER GROANING)

36:36.278 --> 36:39.361
Would you quit
being such a baby,
pretty boy?

36:39.865 --> 36:41.196
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

36:41.283 --> 36:42.568
Peter...

36:44.536 --> 36:46.743
I may not know
what you are,

36:48.082 --> 36:50.118
but I know who you are.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.957
You're one of us.

36:55.297 --> 36:58.289
And we have
no secrets
among family.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.059
Well?

37:11.814 --> 37:13.179
Well what?

37:14.483 --> 37:15.893
This is it.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.693
Your box. Your life.
You gonna open it,
or what?

37:22.074 --> 37:24.736
What if it's a life
I don't want?

37:24.827 --> 37:28.911
When I had Will
against the wall,
lcould've killed him.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.498
I wanted to.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.536
What if that's who I am?

37:33.627 --> 37:34.958
But you didn't
kill him, did you?

37:35.045 --> 37:36.330
No. That's because of you.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.663
It's not because
of me, Peter.

37:39.466 --> 37:42.754
You're a good soul.
I can tell.

37:46.682 --> 37:50.345
But what if I open this box
and I find otherwise?

37:51.019 --> 37:52.850
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

37:54.022 --> 37:56.729
Do you like
where you are
right now?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.483
Do you like
who you are
right now?

38:03.782 --> 38:07.445
Well, then maybe,
for now,
you just leave it be.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.932
CLAIRE: I think
yours is cooler.

38:33.020 --> 38:34.681
Any time
your parents
get annoying

38:34.771 --> 38:37.262
you can just
open the window
and take off.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.440
Are you kidding?
You're indestructible.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.809
You can skydive
without a parachute.

38:42.905 --> 38:45.521
You could skydive
without a plane.

38:45.616 --> 38:46.856
(BOTH GIGGLING)

38:46.950 --> 38:48.861
You can eat fire.
Just for kicks.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.567
I feel pain.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.077
| just get over it quickly.

38:53.415 --> 38:55.497
So how would it feel
then if I do this?

38:55.584 --> 38:56.539
(SCREAMING)

38:56.627 --> 38:57.912
It hurts.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.997
(LAUGHING)
What about this, then?

39:00.088 --> 39:01.624
(BOTH LAUGHING)

(WAVES CRASHING)

39:23.362 --> 39:25.148
What's on your neck?

39:35.332 --> 39:38.620
A couple years ago
when we were living
in St. Louis,

39:39.836 --> 39:41.872
l was riding my bike
to school.

39:41.964 --> 39:44.330
And next thing I knew,
it was a day later,

39:44.424 --> 39:46.005
and lwas
waking up in my bed.

39:47.219 --> 39:51.212
Last thing I remember
is this man stepping
out of the bushes,

39:51.306 --> 39:52.341
calling my name.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.388
What are you
talking about?
What man?

39:54.977 --> 39:56.342
I don't know who he was.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.598
But I remember the way
he looked at me.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.934
Like I was an animal
he wanted to trap.

40:03.485 --> 40:07.478
I try to put him
out of my head but
sometimes I see his face.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.531
That guy with
the horn-rimmed glasses.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.251
l have another vial.

40:23.338 --> 40:24.714
I'll get started
on it right away.

40:28.844 --> 40:30.675
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

40:33.432 --> 40:34.592
Yeah?

40:35.601 --> 40:37.762
l have to take
this outside.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.608
(PHONE DIALING)

40:51.241 --> 40:52.276
Where are you?

40:52.367 --> 40:55.200
N/KI: ljust got here.
I ’m sitting in your office.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.240
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to cure me?

41:01.335 --> 41:02.620
Yes.

41:02.711 --> 41:04.747
And, like I said,
in exchange,

41:04.838 --> 41:08.001
we're going to want
a little something from you.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.835
They're moving
the paintings somewhere.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.921
There's only
a few crates left.

41:16.016 --> 41:19.474
This was a terrible idea.
This guy is watching
my every move.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.472
I can't do this.
I'm in over my head.

41:21.563 --> 41:24.020
I've told you.
You have no reason
to worry.

41:24.107 --> 41:26.849
As long as I'm alive,
you will be taken care of.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.528
That's exactly the problem.

41:32.616 --> 41:34.277
What are you talking about?

41:35.202 --> 41:36.487
(PANTING)

41:36.578 --> 41:38.990
I'm sending you a JPEG
of a painting I found.

41:39.081 --> 41:40.321
The rest have been
shipped off somewhere.

41:40.415 --> 41:42.792
It’s the last in the series.
Eight of eight.

41:44.336 --> 41:47.169
MR. BENNET: Well, we know
how it begins, with the death
of Kaito Nakamura.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.337
But how does it end?

41:49.424 --> 41:51.289
Not well, I'm afraid.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.869
Good night, Claire.

42:21.957 --> 42:23.618
Good night, Dad.
