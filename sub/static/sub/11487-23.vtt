00:01.160 --> 00:02.513
-Morning.
-Morning.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.672
Yeah, what's up?

00:08.160 --> 00:09.718
Oh, stop it.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.998
-Hey. Give me back my skully.
-This is not a skully.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.674
lt's a ski cap your grandmother
gave you for Christmas.

00:15.880 --> 00:18.952
-Charlie, he's just trying to find his look.
-Word.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.198
Word?

00:21.400 --> 00:24.517
There's a reindeer on it.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.038
Don't listen to him, Jake.
l think it looks very dope on you.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.633
Oh, man.

00:32.600 --> 00:36.149
Oh, hey, did you see that your former
girlfriend's dance troupe is in town?

00:36.320 --> 00:39.756
Mia's here? Let me see that.
Come on, come on, come on.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.837
Whoa, is somebody
still carrying a torch?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.752
Torch? Don't be ridiculous.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.435
l mean, l'm glad to see she's following
her dream but l've moved on.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.435
-l think she called the other day.
-What? When?

00:51.640 --> 00:53.517
What did she want?
What did she say?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.676
Come on, kid, spill it.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.189
Nope, no unresolved feelings there.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.790
She wanted to talk to you
but you weren't home.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.998
l know that, you chowderhead.
What else did she say?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.949
She said, ''What's new?''
l said, ''Nothing much. ''

01:08.120 --> 01:10.554
And then she said, ''How's school?''
l said, ''lt sucks. ''

01:10.720 --> 01:13.996
Then she said, ''That's too bad. ''
l said, ''Yeah. ''

01:14.680 --> 01:18.070
l'm gonna kill him, Alan.
l swear to God l'm gonna kill him.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.512
Oh, yeah, she wants us
to come see her dance next weekend.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.791
lt says she's performing this weekend.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.428
Oh, l guess she called last weekend.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.870
-You're telling me this now?
-Charlie. Calm down.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.076
How many things
does the kid have to handle?

01:31.240 --> 01:33.117
Eat, poop, tell me who called.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.473
She said some guy named Will
has tickets.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.117
-Who's Will?
-l don't know. She said he'd call.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.359
Will's gonna call?

01:45.520 --> 01:49.229
-You mean the tickets are at will call?
-l don't know. Maybe.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.557
Dear God, he's a doorstop that eats.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.595
Do me a favor. From now on,
when somebody calls, write it down.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.318
-l did.
-Where?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.869
-On my homework.
-Okay, where's your homework?

02:03.040 --> 02:06.316
Oh yeah, my teacher called.
She wants to meet with you.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.079
When?

02:08.240 --> 02:10.071
Oh, l guess it was last week.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.436
Peace out.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:23.440 --> 02:25.032
Great. Great. Thank you.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.829
Mia left us four seats for Friday night.
House seats, center orchestra.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.829
What do you think? You, me, Jake, Kandi,
go out to dinner, make an evening of it?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.069
Sounds like fun.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.432
Maybe afterwards you could tie me to an
anthill, and smear honey on my genitals.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.155
So you don't wanna go?

02:41.640 --> 02:44.632
Jeez, now l see where
the kid gets his brains.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.628
No, l don't wanna go.
Why would l wanna go?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.597
Because you were in love
with the woman. . .

02:49.760 --> 02:52.228
. . .and still have feelings for her
and wanna see her.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.960
Oh, that's crazy.
God, you are so naive.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.271
-How am l naive?
-Oh, oh, l know this one.

03:01.480 --> 03:05.075
Alan, when an ex-girlfriend calls,
no good can come from it.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.674
Unless, you know,
it's 2 a.m., she's blind drunk. . .

03:07.840 --> 03:10.991
. . .and wants to get even
with her new cheating boyfriend.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.475
She just wanted to invite us
to the ballet.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.393
Yeah, right.
And girls are completely unaware. . .

03:16.560 --> 03:19.074
. . .that you can see their nipples
through their shirts.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.593
What does that have to--?
Really, they know?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.871
There's only a few reasons
why an ex calls.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.315
One, they're great,
and wanna rub your nose in it.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.869
Or two, they're doing lousy
and need to borrow money.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.634
Three, they got money
from knocking over a Laundromat. . .

03:35.800 --> 03:38.837
. . .and wanna hide it under your trailer
until the heat's off.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.792
lt happens.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.719
Okay, okay, how about four?
She misses you, and wants to try again?

03:48.880 --> 03:50.836
What is it she's gonna try?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.116
To change me into something l'm not?

03:53.280 --> 03:56.317
To get me to stop drinking,
smoking, gambling?

03:56.480 --> 04:01.554
To rescue me from the barren,
loveless abyss my life has become?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.353
What?

04:08.600 --> 04:09.589
You know what l think?

04:09.760 --> 04:12.069
You were never happier
than when you were with Mia.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.959
You still have feelings for her.
You're afraid to admit it.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.033
You are so wrong.
You couldn't be more wrong.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.555
-You believe that guy?
-You want the truth?

04:22.640 --> 04:25.757
-No, probably not.
-Good call.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.674
Oh, by the way,
here's the 20 bucks l owe you.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.308
l am telling you, it is not appropriate
to wear to the ballet.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.796
Why you tripping on me?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.356
Hey, Alan. Matey.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.757
-l'm not a pirate.
-You're not a gangsta either.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.913
You're a dorky, white kid
with a Cub Scout bandana on his head.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.949
Yo, hate the game,
don't hate the player.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.398
You know kids better than me.
How long does this pimp stage last?

05:07.760 --> 05:08.749
Just ignore him.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.798
-You sure you won't come with us?
-Positive.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.758
-Should l at least say hi to Mia for you?
-Say what you want.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.155
-l'm meeting somebody at Pavlov's.
-Who?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.157
How would l know?
l haven't met her yet.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.757
Hi. Do l look okay?

05:28.200 --> 05:31.476
-Perfect.
-Hey, no fair.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.393
You grow a rack like that, you can
wear anything you want on your head.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.876
You have a house on the beach?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.352
l'd love to see it.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.193
-l could take you there.
-Great.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.435
Then l could bring you out
on my deck.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.830
We could watch the surf
in the moonlight.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.151
Then l could take you in my arms,
kiss you. Not a big kiss.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.312
Just a little something that gives you
a taste of what's to come.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.516
Well, let's go.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.709
l'd take your hand
and lead you up to my bedroom. . .

06:05.880 --> 06:07.552
. . .where l'd slowly undress you.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.836
Then lay you down on the crisp,
cool sheets. . .

06:10.000 --> 06:13.310
. . .and make wild, passionate love
to you until we're both totally spent.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.636
Okay.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.678
Then in the morning, l'll bring you
a cup of coffee and your car keys.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.229
Wait, my car keys?

06:25.600 --> 06:28.319
l'll promise to call you
but l never will.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.677
And when you call me, you'll find
that the phone number l gave you. . .

06:31.840 --> 06:35.230
. . .belongs to a dry cleaner
in Koreatown.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.918
What?

06:38.800 --> 06:41.394
When all is said and done,
you know what we'll both have?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.629
Nothing.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.109
Not even a good memory.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.759
What do you say we do us both a favor
and not go through with this charade?

06:50.960 --> 06:52.996
Okay.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.193
Jeez, l was just trying to get laid.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.390
See, Jake, the swan is dying.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.036
Can you believe--?

07:13.840 --> 07:19.153
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Excuse me. Hey.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.788
-What did l miss?
-l thought you weren't coming.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.034
l'm not here for Mia.
l'm here to support the arts.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.718
Yikes, look at the package
on that pretty dude.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.439
Hey, good job.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.828
Eat something.

07:43.680 --> 07:47.195
-Charlie.
-Hey. You were terrific.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.191
Thank you.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.271
-l'm so glad you came.
-Are you kidding me?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.590
l've been looking forward to this
all week.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.958
-Dressed like that?
-Well, how else would you recognize me?

07:59.280 --> 08:03.273
-These are for you.
-Thank you. They're beautiful.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.749
No big deal, they had them
at the liquor store.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.832
lt was either this
or a stack of lotto scratchers.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.833
-l think you made the wise choice.
-We'll never know, will we?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.468
Alan would've come,
but he had to take the kids home.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.552
-Kids?
-He's kind of adopted a young girl.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.030
-Really?
-Well, not so much adopted as banging.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.869
So you're looking good.

08:25.280 --> 08:30.035
-You too. How have you been?
-Great. Just great. Really great.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.111
-Good.
-No, no. No, great.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.359
-And you, how have you been?
-Wonderful.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.953
All right then, l'm great
and you're wonderful.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.634
So what the hell are we doing here?

08:42.799 --> 08:45.234
There was something
l wanted to talk to you about.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.996
-Hey, Mia. Who's your cute friend?
-This is Charlie. Charlie, Theresa.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.559
Hey.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.631
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.350
This really isn't the right place.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.715
Why don't l get changed
and stop by your house?

08:58.880 --> 09:00.154
Sure. l'll be up.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.754
-Because, you know, l'm a night person.
-l remember.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.030
Of course, if you come too late,
l could be drunk.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.430
-l remember.
-There could be other women there.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.238
l remember.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.198
-See you later.
-Whatever.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.359
Hey, can you unhook me?

09:36.640 --> 09:38.471
What's going on?

09:38.960 --> 09:40.029
Nothing.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.316
Mia's coming over, so l thought l'd--

09:42.480 --> 09:44.038
Nothing.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.992
-l see.
-What do you mean you see?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.148
You're right. lt's too much.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.431
-How's that?
-Well, l--

09:59.600 --> 10:03.957
Right. She'll smell there were candles
burning, so l have to light at least one.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.918
-What about the music?
-What about it?

10:07.080 --> 10:09.719
You're right.
Sounds like l'm trying too hard.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.279
-Better?
-Well, l--

10:18.440 --> 10:19.998
You're right.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.794
No music.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.719
-Charlie?
-Yeah?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.399
l'm just glad you're over her.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.311
Get the door. Get the door.
Get the door.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.834
-Hi, Alan.
-Hey, Mia, you were great tonight.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.356
-Thanks. Did Jake like it?
-He was absolutely knocked out.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.595
Charlie, Mia's here.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.796
Oh, really?

10:48.960 --> 10:52.270
-Well, ask her in.
-All right.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.349
-Won't you come in?
-Okay.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.274
Hi, Mia, l almost forgot
you were coming.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.472
Get out.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.510
-Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you too.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.274
Sit down, make yourself at home.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.588
Place looks the same.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.558
Well, you know me,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.075
lf it is broke, who gives a rat's ass?

11:15.480 --> 11:17.675
-Can l get you a drink?
-No, l'm good.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.833
-So am l. ln fact, l'm great.
-Yeah, you mentioned that.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.035
Repeatedly.

11:24.880 --> 11:29.032
So, what did you wanna talk about?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.071
Oh, boy.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.799
This is a hard thing to ask.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.349
You need some money.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.153
What? No.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.076
So, what? You wanna get back
together again?

11:42.240 --> 11:44.595
Oh, God no.

11:52.240 --> 11:56.358
All right, then, how about
a quickie for old times' sake?

11:56.520 --> 11:58.397
Please.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.199
Charlie. . .

12:00.360 --> 12:02.396
. . .l think you're a terrific guy.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.358
You're smart, you're handsome,
you're talented.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.715
All good arguments for the quickie.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.836
-Will you let me finish?
-Didn't l always?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.397
Sorry. Sorry, go on.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.309
l've been thinking a lot lately
about what l want out of life.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.552
l love dancing, but let's face it,
l'm not getting any younger.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.598
So the time has come
for me to make some tough choices.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.398
-l understand completely.
-You do?

12:29.560 --> 12:31.551
No, l'm just trying to be supportive.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.712
Charlie, l came here because--

12:37.680 --> 12:38.954
Well--

12:41.480 --> 12:42.879
l want your sperm.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.110
All right, where do you want it?

13:00.240 --> 13:03.676
-Alan, Alan, wake up. Wake up.
-What?

13:03.840 --> 13:05.876
Mia wants sperm.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.790
Well, don't look at me.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.475
No, no, she wants my sperm.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.438
She wants me to make a deposit
so she can have a baby.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.479
-You're kidding.
-Apparently, that's another of its uses.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.639
What the hell is that?

13:22.800 --> 13:26.076
l'm not sure. Near as l can tell,
she's chasing a rabbit.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.398
So why did Mia come to you?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.711
Well, it turns out
her biological clock is ticking.

13:32.880 --> 13:37.112
Most of the guys she meets are
ballet dancers, so, slim pickings there.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.115
She doesn't wanna wait
for Mr. Right to come along.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.352
-Which pretty much leaves you.
-Yep.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.958
l'm good genetic material,
you know, easy on the eyes.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.999
And she wants to raise the kid alone
which fits nicely into my lifestyle.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.757
Charlie, drinking, gambling
and casual sex is not a lifestyle.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.798
Okay, okay, l didn't come in here
to argue with you.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.230
Look in the hedges,
look in the hedges.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.553
What?

14:03.000 --> 14:03.989
l don't know.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.639
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna go to a sperm bank?

14:08.800 --> 14:11.951
Well, l tried to talk her into
a direct deposit.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.192
You know, straight from the tap.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.548
But she really dug in her heels.
And not in the good way.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.228
-And you're okay with it?
-Well, why not?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.311
l've sent billions of soldiers out there.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.233
lt's time for one of them
to finally take the hill.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.550
-Now what?
-l think she caught the rabbit.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.158
Anyway, l'm thinking
this could be my one chance. . .

14:38.320 --> 14:40.754
. . .to guarantee
that the Charlie gene lives on.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.639
You know, make sure
the double helix that is uniquely me. . .

14:43.800 --> 14:45.870
. . .keeps on trucking into the future.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.230
Okay, let's assume
that's a good thing.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.631
-One more question.
-Yeah?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.633
lf you have no doubts,
why'd you wake me up to tell me?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.791
Well, you're my brother. . .

14:56.960 --> 14:59.633
. . .and l thought you should know
you're gonna be an uncle.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.473
You mean, l'm gonna be an uncle
to a child l'll never see.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.356
Tell you what, when he turns 1 2,
l'll track him down. . .

15:06.520 --> 15:10.399
. . .bring him to live with you and we'll
see if you get your phone messages.

15:16.760 --> 15:20.275
-What do you think?
-Looks like pretty standard boilerplate.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.877
lt says that once your swim team's
off the bus, you're no longer the coach.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.077
All right. Let's see, where do l sign?

15:29.240 --> 15:32.277
The old John Hancock, if you will.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.598
You sure you want to?

15:34.760 --> 15:37.149
You're giving up the rights
not only to your sperm. . .

15:37.320 --> 15:41.074
. . .but to any children
that might result from them. lt.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.838
-l understand.
-Do you?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.993
Once you sign, Mia can do whatever
she wants with it. Them.

15:47.320 --> 15:52.155
She can use it, resell it, freeze it,
put it on eBay.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.630
Hey, l don't care if she uses it
to caulk her bathtub.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.511
Once the boys reach escape velocity,
they're on their own.

15:59.920 --> 16:04.072
-l see.
-lt's out of my hands, so to speak.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.798
l got it.

16:07.040 --> 16:09.474
Okay. l'll be back in two shakes.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.594
Three, if it's cold in there.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.074
Charlie? You okay?

17:16.920 --> 17:19.434
-Charlie?
-What?

17:19.599 --> 17:22.160
You've been in there a long time.
How's it going?

17:22.319 --> 17:23.877
How do you think it's going?

17:25.200 --> 17:28.988
Well, l don't know if this'll help,
but sometimes when l was married. . .

17:29.160 --> 17:32.789
. . .l used to pretend l was having sex
with a completely different woman.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.509
Oh, thanks. The image of you
bumping uglies with your ex-wife. . .

17:36.680 --> 17:38.636
. . .should really move things along.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.877
Excuse me, l was just trying to help.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.077
Yeah, well, l was just trying
to have sex with a cup.

17:44.240 --> 17:49.189
Don't think of it as a cup.
Think of it as a polyurethane lapdancer.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.039
-Get out.
-l'm going.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.438
-Hello?
-Charlie, l was just getting packed.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.909
Oh, right, you're heading
to San Francisco.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.670
That's gotta be a big ballet town.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.158
Yeah.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.199
So did you go to the sperm bank?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.753
And?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.876
Not a lot of laughs in that place.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.634
l asked the receptionist
if she takes work home with her.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.756
Nothing. Not even a smile.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.998
Thanks for doing this.
You have no idea what it means to me.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.556
Yeah, well, funny thing, turns out
it means something to me too.

18:27.760 --> 18:31.309
-What are you talking about?
-l tried, Mia, l really did.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.072
l tried the magazines, the movies.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.435
You can't imagine
how bad porn acting is. . .

18:35.600 --> 18:38.717
. . .until you actually watch more
than three, four minutes at a time.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.833
So you're saying you couldn't? You?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.151
Yeah, l know. What are the odds?

18:45.600 --> 18:49.513
Well, l guess these things happen.
You'll try again. l'm sure you'll do fine.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.470
l don't think so.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.675
Why not?

18:54.240 --> 18:55.878
l have thoughts about the reason. . .

18:56.040 --> 18:59.669
. . .things didn't go down
as planned, or actually, up.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.077
Okay, l'm listening.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.555
As l was sitting
in that little sperm cubicle. . .

19:05.720 --> 19:10.589
. . .watching Assmasters 7:
The Final Chapter. . .

19:11.240 --> 19:14.596
. . .all l could think about was some kid
of mine growing up somewhere. . .

19:14.760 --> 19:19.311
. . .and me not having a chance to,
you know, be a part of his life.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.479
-l thought you were okay with that.
-l thought l was too.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.995
But as it turns out, l'm not.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.390
So if this is something
you really wanna do. . .

19:27.560 --> 19:30.154
. . .then you're gonna have
to find someone else.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.358
l see.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.672
And by the way, Assmasters 7
is not the final chapter.

19:39.520 --> 19:42.034
They left a lot of loose ends.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.556
All right, well, l gotta go.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.280
-l appreciate the effort.
-Oh, thanks.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.079
l think l have a rotator cuff injury.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.751
Good seeing you again, Charlie.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.393
Good seeing you too.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.398
-Hey, let me float another idea by you.
-What?

20:06.560 --> 20:08.755
lt's a little crazy, a little unorthodox.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.354
lf you really want a kid,
this could be the solution.

20:11.520 --> 20:15.832
-Charlie, l am not having sex with you.
-Who said anything about having sex?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.838
l'm asking you to marry me.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.793
There's no Charlie here.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.474
Why you stupid girls keep calling?

20:32.640 --> 20:36.758
No, listen, l don't take message.
l do dry cleaning.

20:37.160 --> 20:41.073
One more time,
there's no Charlie here.
