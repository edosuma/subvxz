WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.000 --> 00:12.958
<i>We're trapped in a cycle.</i>

00:15.208 --> 00:18.458
<i>We're born, we love, we get sick,</i>

00:18.541 --> 00:19.583
<i>we die.</i>

00:20.250 --> 00:24.750
<i>We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.</i>

00:25.250 --> 00:30.333
<i>We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.</i>

00:30.416 --> 00:36.166
<i>We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.</i>

00:43.000 --> 00:44.333
By six.

00:44.833 --> 00:48.708
By three, Eva.
Your sister can't come back by herself.

00:48.791 --> 00:50.833
-But, Dad!
-Don't start with me.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.458
Thanks, Sofía. Love you too.

00:53.541 --> 00:55.666
Yeah, I'm also dying to go with you.

00:55.750 --> 00:56.625
By five.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.416
If she wants to leave earlier,
walk her home, okay?

01:01.083 --> 01:03.041
-Be careful, both of you.
-Bye.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.791
Can I get a kiss goodbye?

01:07.500 --> 01:09.250
-Stay together.
-Don't worry.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.083
-We'll be like two balls in a nutsack.
-You're so gross!

01:12.166 --> 01:13.333
Let's go.

01:15.166 --> 01:16.166
Hey.

01:57.041 --> 01:58.833
Nice house.

02:00.375 --> 02:01.375
Smells like you.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.666
-And in the center of town.
-Let's go.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.208
The younger one has your eyes.

02:17.583 --> 02:18.875
Put the picture down.

02:19.416 --> 02:21.291
You two should be happy.

02:23.250 --> 02:26.250
We've been waiting
for this moment a long time.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.208
Twenty years, and you're finally
performing the fifth veil.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.416
Where's everyone else?

02:30.500 --> 02:32.708
Snowflake showed them the way to the mine.

02:34.375 --> 02:35.291
Ready to go?

02:36.625 --> 02:37.666
Wait for us outside.

02:44.916 --> 02:47.291
Elena, we can buy ourselves more time.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.333
Think about Eva and Sofía.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.125
You think I'm not?

02:51.916 --> 02:54.708
They'll go after the girls
if I don't perform the fifth veil tonight.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.166
MAYOR OF FERIA MISSING

02:56.250 --> 02:58.291
They're fanatics.
We know what they're capable of.

03:02.375 --> 03:05.041
DO YOU WANT HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF?

03:09.041 --> 03:11.375
-You found yourself the wrong woman.
-No.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.125
-I'm sorry.
-No.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.125
Hey.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.750
I might regret a lot of things.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.291
I've got a knack for that.

03:22.625 --> 03:24.291
But finding you isn't one of them.

03:56.416 --> 04:00.708
<i>His Excellency the head of state</i>
<i>has experienced the following</i>

04:00.791 --> 04:02.708
<i>in the progression of his illness.</i>

04:02.791 --> 04:06.958
<i>At 10:00 p.m.,</i>
<i>he experienced abdominal bloating,</i>

04:07.041 --> 04:10.083
<i>which was treated</i>
<i>with the usual medication.</i>

04:10.166 --> 04:13.833
<i>During the nighttime</i>
<i>and early morning hours, he rested.</i>

04:13.916 --> 04:19.000
<i>Pardo Palace, October 25, 1975.</i>

04:28.208 --> 04:30.375
A FUTURE FOR FERIA

04:37.833 --> 04:39.583
NO TO THE CLOSURE

04:39.666 --> 04:41.958
YOU WON'T CLOSE THE MINE

04:43.166 --> 04:45.916
Not a good idea for someone
with asthma to be smoking.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.666
I know, Victoriano.

04:48.666 --> 04:49.708
You're right.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.166
<i>At 3:00 p.m., November 3…</i>

04:55.250 --> 04:59.416
-Mayor. Mr. Barnés…
<i>-</i>God willing, our Caudillo will recover.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.125
<i>…paleness and low blood pressure</i>
<i>with intense pain…</i>

05:02.208 --> 05:06.625
-What will become of Spain without him?
-Yes, definitely. God willing.

05:07.416 --> 05:11.916
Mayor Barnés, with the miners protesting,
we can't get inside and take measurements.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.250
Lozano!

05:17.416 --> 05:19.625
-Escort the surveyor so he can do his job.
-Sure.

05:19.708 --> 05:24.125
Don't use force. The way things are going,
I don't need union problems.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.208
Okay.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.166
Luis, Antonio, come with me.

05:28.791 --> 05:31.000
Marcos, you too.

05:44.916 --> 05:48.166
-Get out of here! You can't get through!
-Get out!

05:48.250 --> 05:49.958
Get out of here! Go!

05:50.041 --> 05:52.291
Hey, no violence!

05:52.875 --> 05:54.166
No violence! No, stop!

05:54.250 --> 05:55.333
Elías, easy!

05:57.041 --> 05:59.791
Elías! Hey.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.375
Elías! Are you okay?

06:03.208 --> 06:05.250
Marcos. Remember what you're here for.

07:11.583 --> 07:12.583
Father.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.500
Father.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.958
How are you?

07:20.041 --> 07:21.041
Okay.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.375
I brought you figs.

07:24.625 --> 07:25.833
I know you like them.

07:26.750 --> 07:27.958
Thank you, darling.

07:28.833 --> 07:29.833
Look.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.750
Franco is dying.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.291
Doesn't change a thing.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.583
They're talking about amnesty.

07:40.666 --> 07:42.500
You won't have to hide here anymore.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.000
I'm not hiding, Elena.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.500
I came out of hiding years ago.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.166
We followed the path, darling.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.083
We're one step away from the light.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.083
From true power.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.583
How long have you been in here?

07:58.500 --> 07:59.666
Since '42?

08:00.625 --> 08:04.250
That's 33 years.
You haven't had the chance to live.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.916
-They never let you.
-Listen to me.

08:06.916 --> 08:09.708
What you call "living"
is nothing more than a bad dream.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.000
You've completed three veils.

08:11.083 --> 08:14.500
There are only two more to reach the light
and open the gates to the kingdom.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.000
To free us from the pain of this world.

08:17.541 --> 08:19.708
Elena, you're a perfect one.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.000
You're the key to the light.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.625
<i>We should blow up</i>
<i>the miners' houses with them inside.</i>

09:04.708 --> 09:08.333
We either build an open-pit mine,
or the mine shuts down.

09:08.416 --> 09:12.291
-What?
-If they stay inside, that's too bad.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.958
They better not come crying to us
when they get blown up.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.500
Everyone gets what they deserve, Pablo.

09:39.375 --> 09:40.708
Victoriano, is that you?

09:50.041 --> 09:51.333
Is someone there?

09:54.666 --> 09:57.541
The mine is off-limits.
I'll call the police.

10:02.750 --> 10:03.625
Hey.

10:04.208 --> 10:07.041
Hey! What are you doing?
You can't be down here. You hear?

10:07.125 --> 10:11.041
The mine is closed.
Are you listening? Wait!

10:12.166 --> 10:15.375
The mine is closed.
You hear? Where are you?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.500
<i>You're out of your mind.</i>

10:27.583 --> 10:29.708
I swear, there was a woman.

10:29.791 --> 10:33.916
How long have we been here? Two months?
Two months in a town with no whores.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.916
I don't know why I tell you anything.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.041
We're only human, Pablo.
A guy needs to bust a nut.

10:39.125 --> 10:43.166
-If you don't, that stuff gets backed up.
-Sure. Thanks a lot, doc.

10:43.250 --> 10:45.916
I'm gonna grab a drink
before I go to the boardinghouse.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.125
Save your money.
Let's go to a whorehouse in Córdoba.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.625
-Listen to me.
-See you later.

10:50.708 --> 10:52.166
Get going, you dumbass.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.291
Excuse me. A glass of sherry?

11:02.750 --> 11:04.583
You're from the mining company, right?

11:04.666 --> 11:06.500
We don't serve you guys here.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.250
Come on, pour him some wine.
He's just following orders.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.250
-I'll even pay for it.
-You're hilarious.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.666
-You're with the police, right?
-Yeah.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.666
-Thanks.
-No problem, man.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.541
I get you, you know?

11:18.625 --> 11:21.666
People blame us for everything,
but we're just doing our jobs.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.166
Same as the miners.

11:23.791 --> 11:26.791
Enough with that crap
about "we don't have a choice."

11:26.875 --> 11:29.500
It's what the dictatorship
wants us to think.

11:29.583 --> 11:30.500
We have a choice.

11:30.583 --> 11:33.250
My brother-in-law, Elías.
Real pain in the ass.

11:34.458 --> 11:37.541
Hon, can't you tell him to can it?
Why don't you bother someone else?

11:37.625 --> 11:39.541
Well, maybe I agree with him.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.541
Yeah, well said.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.541
Ever since he put on that uniform,
he can't think for himself.

11:43.625 --> 11:46.791
Hey, the company
wants the mine to keep operating.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.125
By evicting the miners
to have an open-pit mine?

11:50.208 --> 11:52.458
You know what that is? A load of bull.

11:52.541 --> 11:55.666
The mayor wants to get us
out of the way, but we won't let him.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.625
We'll lock ourselves inside,
like the miners in Pamplona.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.541
Hell yeah. We will!

12:01.208 --> 12:04.125
Who wants to toast
to Franco being on his last legs?

12:04.208 --> 12:06.083
-Come on!
-Olé!

12:06.708 --> 12:09.208
Olé! Yeah!

12:09.291 --> 12:12.000
Hold on, Elena. Give me that bottle.

12:12.083 --> 12:12.958
Let's see.

12:13.041 --> 12:16.666
Elena, give me that bottle,
or you'll get me in trouble.

12:16.750 --> 12:20.333
Hey, don't worry.
Nobody's gonna tell Sergeant Lozano, okay?

12:20.416 --> 12:23.750
Right? There you go.
Here's to the Caudillo's edemas!

12:39.416 --> 12:40.333
Olé!

12:44.250 --> 12:45.500
Cold out tonight.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.083
Hey. Excuse me.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.583
What?

12:53.666 --> 12:55.500
What were you doing
in the mine this morning?

12:56.416 --> 12:58.625
You must be confused.
I'm a teacher, not a miner.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.500
No. I know I saw you.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.583
We're blowing up those houses.

13:03.791 --> 13:07.208
It's not safe for you to be there.
It could cave in.

13:07.833 --> 13:10.791
I just told you.
I'm not the woman you're looking for.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.708
Victoriano! Hey!

13:25.416 --> 13:27.291
-What?
-A bit more to the right.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.375
-Here?
-A little more.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.000
-More?
-Yeah.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.750
Not that much. What are you doing?

13:34.083 --> 13:35.041
Stay there.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.166
<i>…severe electrocardiographic episodes</i>

13:38.250 --> 13:41.208
<i>that were satisfactorily treated</i>

13:41.291 --> 13:45.333
<i>by the cardiology team</i>
<i>performing the surgery.</i>

13:45.833 --> 13:51.958
<i>During the operation, several new ulcers</i>
<i>were discovered in his stomach,</i>

13:52.041 --> 13:53.708
<i>with profuse bleeding.</i>

13:54.291 --> 13:56.625
<i>For that reason, they proceeded to…</i>

13:56.708 --> 13:59.625
Sir, Sergeant Lozano called.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.625
The houses at the mine
have been cleared out.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.708
Thank you, Samuel.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.500
-Can I go this time?
-Of course.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.166
I want you to be there
for Elena's fourth veil.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.375
We're so close to the light.

14:13.458 --> 14:16.291
You're going to be a part
of this new world too.

14:19.958 --> 14:22.083
<i>Barnés is up to something.</i>

14:22.166 --> 14:26.000
You know his secretary, Samuel.
Get him to talk.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.166
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.750
Elías has friends in the press.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.500
Things can't just get swept
under the rug anymore, Marcos.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.000
Just what I needed to hear.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.916
For Christ's sake.

14:49.041 --> 14:52.166
-And then he gets pissed off.
-Come on, sit down.

15:04.041 --> 15:05.375
Weren't you a teacher?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.083
I help Verónica sometimes.
She couldn't make it today.

15:12.416 --> 15:13.708
But there was no need.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.666
-No one's in the mood to drink.
-Yeah.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.541
Can I get you something?

15:21.666 --> 15:24.125
I'm not exactly happy
people were evicted either.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.291
But you're still
gonna blow them up, right?

15:28.500 --> 15:32.541
Well, sometimes you're part
of something you don't like.

15:32.625 --> 15:33.833
And… I don't know.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.291
What do you want me to say?
It's not easy to get out.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.166
That is true.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.083
We're a couple of cowards.

15:50.958 --> 15:51.875
Both of us.

15:53.875 --> 15:54.916
Cheers.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.083
I doubt you are.

16:08.458 --> 16:09.708
You don't know me.

16:10.708 --> 16:11.916
Others wouldn't agree.

16:13.666 --> 16:15.666
How about you let me
get to know you better?

16:20.958 --> 16:22.000
You won't stay.

16:23.125 --> 16:26.541
I wish I could up
and leave this town too, but…

16:28.916 --> 16:30.125
What's your secret?

16:38.375 --> 16:39.875
I love this song.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.250
It's closing time.

16:53.416 --> 16:54.958
What are you mixed up in?

16:56.125 --> 16:57.583
Why were you in the mine?

16:58.875 --> 17:01.333
Know what?
I can be a real pain in the ass.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.083
I won't let up until you tell me.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.250
None of your business.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.541
Go, please.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.500
Slow down, Snowflake.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.208
Can you imagine?

18:04.166 --> 18:07.750
What if we got stopped for speeding
after taking every other precaution?

18:14.666 --> 18:16.250
Where have the others been?

18:16.333 --> 18:18.541
Snowflake left some of them in the forest.

18:19.041 --> 18:22.166
And some of them by the road,
in sleeping bags.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.666
They've been careful not to go into town.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.041
We've had our differences, Pablo,

18:30.250 --> 18:32.500
but Elena wants you to be a part of this.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.500
So on my end, all is forgiven.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.375
What the fuck do you have to forgive?

18:40.875 --> 18:42.833
Take the side road, Snowflake.

19:30.666 --> 19:32.666
We've got to go, Elena.

19:36.541 --> 19:37.916
They're waiting for us.

20:00.083 --> 20:00.916
Snowflake!

20:04.083 --> 20:06.041
-Elena, run!
-Come on, Snowflake!

20:07.166 --> 20:09.375
Go to the reservoir!
Get Eva and Sofía and take them!

20:10.583 --> 20:12.041
You hurt me, Pablo.

20:35.583 --> 20:36.708
We can't run away.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.458
We tried that 20 years ago.

20:40.166 --> 20:41.083
I'm sorry.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.083
Luz, come here. Help me.

21:20.958 --> 21:22.250
The tunnel was closed off.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.958
We've been opening it for over a year.

21:25.041 --> 21:28.916
Snowflake's beard has gotten
as white as Luz from being down there.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.083
What about Pablo?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.208
Want to go back to the temple?

21:34.791 --> 21:37.291
It's been too long since the last time.

21:41.083 --> 21:41.958
<i>Who are you?</i>

21:42.708 --> 21:46.583
<i>We are the children of the light.</i>
<i>We are its chosen ones.</i>

21:46.666 --> 21:49.166
What is the sign of your father in you?

21:49.250 --> 21:53.375
It is a movement and a relief.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.666
-Where do you come from?
-We are from the light.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.208
Who are you?

21:58.291 --> 22:02.333
We are the children of the light.
We are its chosen ones.

22:03.625 --> 22:04.958
Welcome, Elena.

22:05.541 --> 22:09.291
Today is a special day.
We will perform the fourth veil.

22:09.791 --> 22:12.125
Today you and Dekta will become one.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.833
Where do you come from?

22:14.916 --> 22:17.041
We are from the light.

22:17.125 --> 22:18.500
Who are you?

22:18.583 --> 22:22.541
We are the children of the light.
We are its chosen ones.

22:22.625 --> 22:25.083
What is the sign of your father in you?

22:25.166 --> 22:29.375
It is a movement and a relief.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.791
Where do you come from?

22:30.875 --> 22:32.500
We are from the light.

22:32.583 --> 22:33.791
Who are you?

22:33.875 --> 22:38.250
We are the children of the light.
We are its chosen ones.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.750
What is the sign of your father in you?

22:40.833 --> 22:44.916
It is a movement and a relief.

23:24.750 --> 23:29.250
When we are stripped of our flesh,
we find ourselves in the relief.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.375
Dekta has chosen you.

24:02.625 --> 24:05.458
He's going to give you
the knowledge of the light.

24:07.458 --> 24:08.458
Candela.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.833
Don't be afraid.

24:17.125 --> 24:18.625
Undress for him.

24:35.291 --> 24:36.208
You who preside

24:37.291 --> 24:40.083
over the hidden mysteries
of the Supreme Triad

24:41.375 --> 24:44.416
and that shine during the night, Behemoth.

24:45.166 --> 24:46.458
Sovereign of death,

24:47.666 --> 24:49.750
bearing your mother's symbol,

24:49.833 --> 24:51.875
I prepare to cross your empire.

25:19.750 --> 25:22.166
Elena, leave your emotions behind.

25:22.250 --> 25:26.000
One with Dekta, you are ready
to complete the fifth veil.

25:39.291 --> 25:40.291
Sweetheart.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.291
It's all over now.

25:45.125 --> 25:48.833
Let's change these sheets
and wash you so you can rest.

26:02.458 --> 26:05.000
Fortunate are the wombs
that have not conceived

26:05.500 --> 26:07.541
and the breasts
that have not been suckled.

26:15.416 --> 26:16.625
What have we done?

26:18.333 --> 26:20.000
He's going to kill her.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.083
I know.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.125
It's never been like this.

26:25.708 --> 26:29.083
Tell Valentín to leave Candela alone.
She's your daughter.

26:35.416 --> 26:36.666
Like he'll listen to me?

26:38.708 --> 26:40.791
We've gone too far.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.875
He only cares about
the coming of the kingdom.

26:44.375 --> 26:47.125
If the light will cost us Candela,

26:47.625 --> 26:48.833
I won't be a part of it.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.208
I'm not going back to the temple.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.750
He won't hurt anyone again.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.416
I promise.

27:35.375 --> 27:36.625
Samuel.

27:37.375 --> 27:38.750
How are you? Got a light?

27:43.708 --> 27:45.666
-Keep it.
-Thanks.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.208
How's Candela? I heard she was sick.

27:51.083 --> 27:53.000
Nothing serious. She'll be fine.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.708
Not like the Caudillo, poor guy.

27:59.416 --> 28:02.000
The only thing that's clear
is he's going to die.

28:03.666 --> 28:05.500
Times change, Marcos.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.708
But what's coming…
doesn't have to be worse.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
I guess it's like everything else.
It all depends on what side you're on.

28:16.416 --> 28:18.958
For people like Barnés,
it'll get better. That's a given.

28:19.666 --> 28:21.041
That's why he's mayor.

28:23.333 --> 28:26.625
I could help you be on the right side.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.166
Where do you come from?

28:35.666 --> 28:37.208
We are from the light.

28:37.708 --> 28:38.958
Who are you?

28:39.541 --> 28:42.916
We are the children of the light.
We are its chosen ones.

28:43.708 --> 28:46.125
What is the sign of your father in you?

28:46.625 --> 28:49.666
It is a movement and a relief.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.916
I know you dream of reaching the light.

28:58.708 --> 29:00.250
Today is the day.

29:01.083 --> 29:04.833
Tonight I'll complete the fifth veil
and open the gate to the kingdom.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.541
All your pain will disappear.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.875
We are ready, Elena.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.666
All of us.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.833
All of us have left behind
the things that bind us.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.375
What did you leave behind?

29:20.666 --> 29:22.416
My daughter in the hospital.

29:24.375 --> 29:25.375
She was dying.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.916
-What God would allow a world like that?
-Your sacrifice sets you apart.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.500
You will be the vessel.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.458
Dekta will live in you.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.250
And you?

29:45.250 --> 29:46.500
Why are you here?

29:49.291 --> 29:52.208
There's no place for us anywhere.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.791
Not in Yugoslavia, not here.

29:55.416 --> 29:58.541
My brother, Goran, met Samuel, and…

29:59.833 --> 30:01.541
There's a better world out there.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.000
I just wanna get out of this hell.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.750
I can't take it anymore.

30:20.958 --> 30:23.125
<i>I don't want the boy inside.</i>
<i>He's not ready.</i>

30:23.208 --> 30:25.041
As you wish.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.166
What's gonna happen to Pablo?

30:31.458 --> 30:34.333
He isn't coming in, but I want to see him.

30:37.875 --> 30:39.000
Get Pablo.

30:45.666 --> 30:47.583
Elena wants to say goodbye.

30:48.791 --> 30:50.708
Don't leave me out! Goran, please!

30:50.791 --> 30:54.333
Calm down, Halid!
You need to embrace the light.

30:54.416 --> 30:56.416
Then I'll come back for you.

30:56.500 --> 30:57.791
-Don't leave me.
-I won't.

30:57.875 --> 30:59.458
-Don't leave me alone!
-Easy!

30:59.541 --> 31:02.833
-Take it easy!
-Don't leave me here alone!

31:05.166 --> 31:06.375
Goran!

31:06.458 --> 31:08.291
Goran, open up!

31:41.791 --> 31:42.791
Elena!

31:44.500 --> 31:45.500
Elena!

32:07.708 --> 32:09.583
Why didn't you run for the reservoir?

32:10.666 --> 32:11.791
And then what?

32:13.416 --> 32:16.958
-You can't stop it this time.
-No.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.541
No, I'll go with you and…

32:22.291 --> 32:23.958
I won't let you die alone.

32:25.791 --> 32:26.833
Elena.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.875
Do it for Eva and Sofía.

32:31.333 --> 32:32.833
Please, do it for them.

32:34.333 --> 32:35.500
For me.

33:02.791 --> 33:05.708
<i>I know that right now</i>

33:05.791 --> 33:10.708
<i>my voice is shaking</i>
<i>with emotion as it reaches your homes--</i>

33:14.750 --> 33:15.750
Marcos.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.750
-When is this thing happening?
-Tonight. In the mine.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.208
They're up to something,
but Samuel wouldn't tell me anything.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.833
Don't go, Marcos.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.250
What if they want to send tanks
into the streets?

33:28.833 --> 33:30.125
Franco's dead.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.833
Besides, wasn't I a coward? Huh?

33:34.916 --> 33:36.583
I'll sneak in behind you.

33:37.125 --> 33:38.125
Sure.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.500
Where's the camera?

33:42.750 --> 33:44.166
What if it goes wrong?

33:44.666 --> 33:47.125
-I don't want to be left alone.
-You won't be.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.708
It'll be in every paper in the country.

33:53.708 --> 33:54.708
Don't worry.

33:55.875 --> 33:56.916
-I love you.
-Love you.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.333
Let's get a move on.

34:08.291 --> 34:10.041
The north-sector explosives are ready.

34:10.125 --> 34:12.666
This is gonna be something else.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.958
Even Franco will hear it up in Heaven.

34:16.041 --> 34:20.250
Mind if I run into town for a minute?
I need my nicotine fix.

34:56.416 --> 34:58.625
Elena, what's wrong?

35:01.541 --> 35:02.541
What's wrong?

35:03.541 --> 35:04.708
Elena.

35:08.083 --> 35:10.500
Elena, calm down. Where are you going?

35:11.708 --> 35:12.958
Stop following me.

35:13.541 --> 35:15.708
It has to be done tonight.
You can't leave.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.583
Are you going to stop me, then?

35:23.041 --> 35:24.375
Why are you losing faith?

35:25.375 --> 35:26.583
Valentín needs you.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.500
-You are the key.
-You saw what happened to Candela?

35:30.291 --> 35:31.708
My father's crazy.

35:32.208 --> 35:36.666
You are too. You're all nuts.
Can't you see what's on the other side?

35:37.250 --> 35:38.625
I can see what's on this side.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.833
My leg hurts more every day.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.583
Soon I won't be able to stand.

35:46.083 --> 35:47.708
I'll need a wheelchair.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.791
I'm dying, Elena.

35:49.875 --> 35:53.333
-We all are.
-Open the fifth veil. Open the gate.

35:53.416 --> 35:56.333
Make the kingdom come
and free us from this pain.

35:56.416 --> 35:58.750
Do you want to continue
in this vicious cycle?

35:59.250 --> 36:01.375
We're born, we love, we get sick, we die?

36:03.875 --> 36:06.458
-We can break it. We can break free--
-Step back.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.541
You can't run away.

36:13.208 --> 36:16.791
Dekta will find you
and bring you back to us.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.625
Tonight in the village square.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.875
-Go away.
-I know you'll be there.

36:21.958 --> 36:23.083
Get out of here!

37:42.375 --> 37:43.375
Hey!

37:44.250 --> 37:45.250
Are you okay?

37:46.875 --> 37:49.458
It's November.
That water must be freezing!

38:06.416 --> 38:09.333
It's okay.

38:09.416 --> 38:12.250
It's all right. Come here. It's okay.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.750
You're still freezing.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.500
What's going on, Elena?

38:34.083 --> 38:35.500
Is it that guy in the car?

38:39.958 --> 38:41.083
Who, then?

38:43.166 --> 38:44.541
What are you so afraid of?

38:55.625 --> 38:57.000
I'm part of something.

38:58.375 --> 39:00.416
It's dangerous. You wouldn't understand.

39:09.416 --> 39:11.166
Stay away from me, Pablo.

39:11.250 --> 39:14.458
-I hurt people. I'm not a good person.
-Elena.

39:14.541 --> 39:15.916
I'm here.

39:17.791 --> 39:18.791
I'm with you.

39:21.791 --> 39:23.791
Promise that tomorrow
you'll forget about me.

39:24.916 --> 39:26.833
Pack your things and get out of Feria.

39:26.916 --> 39:28.041
Promise me.

39:30.708 --> 39:32.000
I promise.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.000
Where do you come from?

41:23.083 --> 41:24.625
We are from the light.

41:24.708 --> 41:26.000
Who are you?

41:26.500 --> 41:30.000
We are the children of the light.
We are its chosen ones.

41:30.083 --> 41:32.666
What is the sign of your father in you?

41:32.750 --> 41:36.291
It is a movement and a relief.

41:36.875 --> 41:39.291
Today is the day we've been waiting for.

41:39.916 --> 41:42.500
Today Elena will complete the fifth veil.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.875
The blood of the sacrifice
will open the gates

41:45.958 --> 41:48.958
so that the perfect one
can summon the Solitary King.

41:49.458 --> 41:52.333
And along with him, the kingdom will come.

41:52.833 --> 41:56.375
A world that will free you
from this nightmare.

42:41.666 --> 42:43.416
We followed the path.

42:44.666 --> 42:46.833
We've reached the fifth veil.

42:48.458 --> 42:53.208
But a traitor has come
to the gates of the Solitary King.

43:55.083 --> 43:57.958
Easy, Marcos.
That thing did something to you!

43:58.041 --> 44:00.416
That thing did something to you!
Stop, Marcos!

44:01.041 --> 44:02.166
Stop it!

44:02.250 --> 44:04.083
Quit it, Marcos!

44:08.375 --> 44:09.291
Stop.

44:09.375 --> 44:10.541
Enough, Marcos.

44:12.666 --> 44:14.250
Where do you come from?

44:14.750 --> 44:16.250
We are from the light.

44:16.875 --> 44:18.125
Who are you?

44:18.208 --> 44:19.875
We are the children of the light.

44:20.375 --> 44:21.958
We are its chosen ones.

44:22.583 --> 44:25.208
What is the sign of your father in you?

44:25.791 --> 44:28.666
It is a movement and a relief.

44:29.666 --> 44:31.166
Where do you come from?

44:31.250 --> 44:33.958
-We are from the light.
-Who are you?

44:34.041 --> 44:35.916
We are the children of the light.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.375
We are its chosen ones.

44:37.958 --> 44:40.625
What is the sign of your father in you?

44:41.125 --> 44:44.000
It is a movement and a relief.

44:44.666 --> 44:45.958
Where do you come from?

44:46.708 --> 44:48.125
We are from the light.

44:48.208 --> 44:49.666
Who are you?

44:49.750 --> 44:51.541
We are the children of the light.

44:51.625 --> 44:55.666
-We are its chosen ones.
-Elías.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.375
Elías, look at me.

44:57.458 --> 45:00.041
-Elías.
-It is a movement and a relief.

45:05.541 --> 45:07.916
The traitor has been revealed.

45:09.375 --> 45:11.875
Now to open the gates…

45:15.458 --> 45:18.500
we must offer the blood of a sacrifice.

45:29.041 --> 45:30.458
Get her out of here.

46:10.583 --> 46:11.583
Let's go!

46:19.708 --> 46:20.708
Run!

46:42.375 --> 46:43.208
Elena.

46:44.083 --> 46:46.583
We've gotta get out of here!

46:55.291 --> 46:56.791
What the fuck was that?

46:57.791 --> 46:58.791
Elena?

46:59.458 --> 47:01.416
What was that down there?

47:05.750 --> 47:07.041
Hell.

47:18.000 --> 47:18.958
Elías.

47:19.041 --> 47:20.375
-Relax.
-What happened?

47:20.458 --> 47:21.875
-Easy.
-What happened?

47:21.958 --> 47:23.833
None of us understand what happened.

47:23.916 --> 47:25.541
-I strangled him.
-Calm down.

47:25.625 --> 47:26.625
Elías.

47:29.208 --> 47:30.208
Elías.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.583
In the beginning, it made sense.

47:46.541 --> 47:48.833
My father taught us the kingdom existed.

47:49.708 --> 47:51.000
A place with no pain.

47:52.625 --> 47:53.625
I don't know how,

47:54.333 --> 47:56.416
but Dekta crossed the altar
and got inside him.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.458
I don't know if he's a god or a demon,

47:59.541 --> 48:01.666
but he turned my father into his puppet.

48:03.541 --> 48:05.083
There's nothing left of him.

48:05.166 --> 48:06.666
They lied to you, Elena.

48:07.208 --> 48:08.250
To all of us.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.833
There is no better place.

48:12.291 --> 48:14.875
On the other side,
there are more beings like Dekta.

48:14.958 --> 48:16.291
They want to cross over.

48:16.833 --> 48:19.500
The only way to stop it
is for me to sacrifice myself.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.833
For me to cross the altar
and close the gate.

48:23.416 --> 48:25.791
-That's what I should've done.
-Elena.

48:27.291 --> 48:29.708
I've got almost all
of the explosives ready.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.625
We'll bury the temple.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.375
My father…

48:42.416 --> 48:45.666
I am a being of light.

48:46.416 --> 48:48.375
I am a being of light.

48:52.625 --> 48:53.666
Elena.

48:56.750 --> 48:58.125
Everyone left except you.

48:59.375 --> 49:02.875
We must complete the fifth veil.
We'll open the gate.

49:05.458 --> 49:06.708
What's wrong?

49:10.958 --> 49:12.583
You have to help me, darling.

50:18.375 --> 50:19.375
It's over.

50:22.416 --> 50:23.500
It's done.

50:44.416 --> 50:48.541
<i>The institution I embody</i>
<i>includes all Spaniards.</i>

50:49.041 --> 50:52.333
<i>And today, at this important hour,</i>

50:52.416 --> 50:53.750
<i>I call on you.</i>

50:53.833 --> 50:58.000
<i>Because we are all equally called upon</i>
<i>to serve Spain.</i>

50:58.083 --> 51:00.750
<i>The King wants</i>
<i>to be the King of all Spaniards at once</i>

51:00.833 --> 51:05.916
<i>and of each and every one</i>
<i>in his culture, history, and tradition.</i>

51:06.000 --> 51:09.208
<i>Addressing the Spanish people</i>
<i>as King from these Cortes</i>…

51:09.291 --> 51:10.916
They'll keep looking for Elías.

51:11.916 --> 51:13.208
They won't find him.

51:13.916 --> 51:16.500
They think he's responsible
for Barnés and his wife.

51:17.708 --> 51:19.458
What if someone talks?

51:19.541 --> 51:20.541
No.

51:21.750 --> 51:23.541
We all need to move on.

51:27.375 --> 51:29.416
How can we keep it a secret?

51:30.000 --> 51:32.541
How am I going to look Verónica
in the eye?

51:33.333 --> 51:34.583
He was her brother.

51:34.666 --> 51:36.500
You weren't yourself, Marcos.

51:36.583 --> 51:37.708
It wasn't you.

51:39.458 --> 51:41.333
If we want to continue on as usual,

51:42.041 --> 51:44.083
we can't just forgive.

51:46.416 --> 51:47.708
We have to forget too.

52:04.291 --> 52:06.541
The day of the fifth veil has arrived.

52:08.083 --> 52:10.458
Elena, perfect one, key to the light.

52:12.416 --> 52:13.666
Open the kingdom.

52:18.625 --> 52:19.916
Solitary King,

52:21.375 --> 52:25.416
bond of blindness, unconscious oblivion.

52:26.666 --> 52:30.250
I greet you, supreme power.

52:37.041 --> 52:38.375
What's wrong, Elena?

52:43.458 --> 52:45.958
The history of the world is a cycle.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.000
Today, here,

52:48.916 --> 52:51.416
I'll do what I should've done
20 years ago.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.458
Put an end to the cycle.

52:55.958 --> 52:57.791
There is no light on the other side.

52:59.583 --> 53:00.583
Just darkness.

53:02.250 --> 53:05.250
And I won't be the one to let it in.

53:19.083 --> 53:20.750
You're doing this out of pity?

53:21.333 --> 53:23.416
What about them? They came here for you.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.625
Bring the Solitary King, or they'll die.
They're already asphyxiating.

53:42.625 --> 53:44.291
Finish the fifth veil.

53:46.250 --> 53:48.458
We must all make a sacrifice.

54:25.250 --> 54:28.666
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>you can close the gate to God?</i>

54:28.750 --> 54:30.000
This is over.

54:31.541 --> 54:32.875
I'm no longer yours.

54:33.958 --> 54:36.166
<i>You're not the only one, Elena.</i>

54:36.750 --> 54:38.208
<i>Sofía will be next.</i>

54:39.750 --> 54:40.750
Mom?

54:41.750 --> 54:42.750
Sofía.

54:43.375 --> 54:44.541
Sofía, get out of here!

54:45.208 --> 54:46.291
Go!

54:47.041 --> 54:48.166
What?

54:48.250 --> 54:51.000
This isn't real. Leave!

54:52.458 --> 54:53.375
Sofía.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.291
<i>The world is like a dragon</i>
<i>biting its tail.</i>

55:10.708 --> 55:13.166
<i>We're trapped in a cycle.</i>

55:15.541 --> 55:19.791
<i>We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.</i>

55:26.375 --> 55:31.125
We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.

55:32.083 --> 55:34.666
<i>We're born, we love,</i>

55:34.750 --> 55:37.333
<i>we get sick, we die.</i>

55:38.916 --> 55:41.083
<i>We're born, we love,</i>

55:41.166 --> 55:43.375
<i>we get sick, we die.</i>

55:45.166 --> 55:47.875
<i>We're born, we love,</i>

55:47.958 --> 55:50.208
<i>we get sick, we die.</i>

55:51.458 --> 55:55.833
<i>We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.</i>

55:57.916 --> 56:01.583
We're born, we love, we get sick, we die.

56:04.541 --> 56:06.916
You can break the cycle.

56:08.750 --> 56:11.208
You can open the gate to the kingdom.

56:13.166 --> 56:15.125
We put our trust in you.

58:51.375 --> 58:54.291
