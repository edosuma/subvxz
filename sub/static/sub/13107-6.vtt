16:36.337 --> 16:38.371
You here
to take another run at me?

16:38.439 --> 16:41.007
Get out.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.342
Turn around.

16:42.410 --> 16:45.045
Let's see what you got,
huh?

16:47.581 --> 16:49.416
You know
Detective Traci Nash.

16:49.450 --> 16:52.352
This here is
Officer Diaz and Peck.

16:52.420 --> 16:53.619
Baby sister, huh?

16:53.687 --> 16:55.688
That's cool.

16:55.756 --> 16:57.824
If you can't trust
family...

16:57.891 --> 16:59.592
So, you want to talk?
Let's talk.

16:59.660 --> 17:00.860
Not without these.

17:00.928 --> 17:02.462
Pretty sure
you and I could find

17:02.529 --> 17:04.630
a better use for those cuffs,
Baby Sister.

17:04.698 --> 17:05.698
- You say it again!
- Hey! Hey!

17:05.766 --> 17:06.699
- Say it again!
- Take it easy.

17:06.767 --> 17:07.967
- Steve! Get off!
- Say it again!

17:08.034 --> 17:09.435
- CHRIS: Let's go. Let's go.
- Hey!

17:09.502 --> 17:11.337
Stop it!
Look at me, okay?

17:11.404 --> 17:12.604
All right.

17:12.637 --> 17:14.006
I'll tell you what...
you get me a confession,

17:14.074 --> 17:15.707
and I will buy you
that terrible bottle of wine.

17:15.775 --> 17:17.509
You know, the one with
the naked baby angels on it.

17:17.577 --> 17:19.345
- Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

17:19.378 --> 17:20.878
Sounds good.

17:25.617 --> 17:28.086
Commissioner.

17:28.153 --> 17:30.455
I was down three strokes
to Councilor Grey

17:30.523 --> 17:32.390
on the 14th
at Cascade View.

17:32.424 --> 17:35.460
You know that hole...
the sand trap on the left?

17:35.528 --> 17:38.062
Uh, no, sir,
I-I can't say that I do.

17:38.097 --> 17:39.898
Cascade View is a...
is a private course.

17:39.966 --> 17:42.133
Thank you very much for
coming down here on a Saturday.

17:42.201 --> 17:43.434
Where's Inspector Jarvis?

17:43.469 --> 17:45.136
Uh, he's at a conference.
We couldn't get him.

17:45.170 --> 17:46.570
Okay,
so what's going on?

17:46.638 --> 17:49.107
We have Boz Shepherd
for the shooting that happened today.

17:49.141 --> 17:50.508
Uh, we have
a partial plate,

17:50.575 --> 17:52.410
and I knew
that you'd want to be here.

17:53.578 --> 17:54.979
The trail
better be clean.

17:55.014 --> 17:56.180
Yeah.
Yeah, by the book.

17:56.215 --> 17:58.582
We got the weapon?
Any witnesses?

17:58.650 --> 18:00.118
Not yet, sir.
Not yet.

18:00.152 --> 18:02.319
But, uh, my officers made some
real connections with those kids

18:02.353 --> 18:04.688
at the baseball game today,
and there is something there.

18:04.723 --> 18:06.089
And I'll make it stick.

18:06.124 --> 18:07.791
You know,
if I left my game today

18:07.826 --> 18:10.327
to see Boz Shepherd go down,
I can live with that.

18:10.361 --> 18:12.062
But if we let him
slip again...

18:12.096 --> 18:13.898
We won't.

18:13.932 --> 18:15.799
We won't.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.734
Good.

18:17.768 --> 18:19.403
[door opens]

18:19.437 --> 18:20.970
You gonna stay
in observation?

18:21.005 --> 18:21.971
GAIL: Yep.

18:22.006 --> 18:23.373
All right.

18:24.642 --> 18:26.243
[buzzer]

18:26.277 --> 18:29.712
Mr. Shepherd tells me
he's quite broken up about the shooting.

18:29.747 --> 18:31.948
Shooting up kids
playing baseball?

18:31.982 --> 18:33.016
[scoffs]

18:33.051 --> 18:34.617
What kind of man
does that?

18:34.652 --> 18:37.854
Same kind that's taken over
six towers in the neighborhood.

18:37.888 --> 18:40.823
The same man
who invented drone patrol...

18:40.858 --> 18:42.926
where you toss someone
off their balcony

18:42.960 --> 18:44.561
to zero in
on their money.

18:44.595 --> 18:46.095
Same man
who's got an alibi

18:46.129 --> 18:47.997
for 6 murders
in the last 10 months

18:48.032 --> 18:49.699
that were gang hits.

18:49.733 --> 18:52.935
A man like that would, uh,
shoot up a field full of kids, yeah.

18:52.969 --> 18:54.903
Yeah,
also a field full of cops?

18:54.971 --> 18:56.205
That part make sense?

18:56.239 --> 18:57.606
You got a silver S.U.V.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.242
Your plates match
what our officers I.D.'d.

19:00.277 --> 19:02.678
I leave that car
out on the street with the keys in it.

19:02.712 --> 19:04.613
Little test
for the neighborhood.

19:04.647 --> 19:07.215
See who's got
the stones.

19:07.283 --> 19:08.383
I guess <i>somebody</i> does.

19:08.417 --> 19:09.651
That's handy.

19:09.686 --> 19:12.120
So, you drive up
and you shoot a bunch of kids,

19:12.154 --> 19:14.656
you park the car
and leave the keys, right?

19:14.691 --> 19:15.724
"Not me, Officer."

19:15.758 --> 19:17.425
No, not me, Officer.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.461
Look, I got
a Saturday routine...

19:19.495 --> 19:21.362
breakfast at Roti Street,
read the paper,

19:21.397 --> 19:22.931
see what's going on
in the world.

19:22.966 --> 19:25.433
I was nowhere near
that field.

19:25.501 --> 19:27.302
Not in the car.

19:27.336 --> 19:29.571
[scoffs]
Check my alibi.

19:29.638 --> 19:32.006
You intimidate people
to keep them quiet.

19:32.040 --> 19:32.974
<i>I know that.</i>

19:33.041 --> 19:34.309
<i>And somebody saw you,</i>

19:34.343 --> 19:37.197
<i>and eventually, one of them
will say something.</i>

19:38.978 --> 19:40.656
Yeah, Boz was here.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.464
Saturday morning,
comes for breakfast,

19:42.511 --> 19:43.854
reads the paper.

19:43.909 --> 19:46.150
What, so he's a regular?
He comes every Saturday?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.551
Regular customer's
a good customer.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.288
How many regular customers
are you getting these days?

19:52.758 --> 19:55.359
Mr. Kim, you can't build
a business on one gangster.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.227
You think
I don't know that?

19:57.262 --> 19:58.529
So, was he here?

19:58.597 --> 20:00.731
Yes, he was here.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.200
Every Saturday,
he's here.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.636
I wish it wasn't true,
but it is.

20:08.539 --> 20:12.342
Let's load in the food,
take off our clothes,

20:12.410 --> 20:13.476
and get in that lake.

20:13.544 --> 20:14.912
Sounds good.

20:16.814 --> 20:18.882
[keys jingle]

20:23.288 --> 20:24.854
Oh, crap.

20:24.922 --> 20:27.524
Somebody broke in.

20:27.591 --> 20:29.859
Or <i>something.</i>

20:34.532 --> 20:35.598
[exhales deeply]

20:35.633 --> 20:37.867
Smells like a zoo
in here.

20:39.437 --> 20:41.804
All right, you know what?
No problem.

20:41.871 --> 20:43.472
We'll clean up.

20:43.506 --> 20:46.042
It'll take an hour... tops.
We'll be right back on track.

20:46.109 --> 20:47.076
[sighs]

20:47.110 --> 20:48.577
What is up with you
right now?

20:48.611 --> 20:49.912
I mean,
usually, it's <i>me</i>

20:49.980 --> 20:52.048
who's overenthused
about terrible situations.

20:52.082 --> 20:54.984
Every goal is sweeter when you
have to work for it, McNally.

20:55.018 --> 20:56.518
Uh-huh.

20:56.553 --> 20:58.219
I'm gonna find
some calamine lotion,

20:58.254 --> 21:00.188
and then we're gonna
scrub this place clean.

21:00.222 --> 21:02.090
Best weekend ever.

21:02.124 --> 21:03.124
Don't push it.

21:05.562 --> 21:06.795
[sighs]

21:08.130 --> 21:10.298
BROOKLYN: I told you...
I didn't see anything,

21:10.333 --> 21:12.668
and I wasn't filming
when the shots were fired.

21:12.702 --> 21:15.270
Don't you need a warrant
for that?

21:15.304 --> 21:17.572
You said
we could look at it, right?

21:19.241 --> 21:21.309
[mouse clicks]

21:23.545 --> 21:25.246
See? Nothing.

21:25.281 --> 21:28.149
Okay.
Just give it a minute.

21:29.918 --> 21:31.786
MAN: <i>Go ahead, baby.
Don't be shy.</i>

21:31.820 --> 21:32.954
<i>[giggles]</i>

21:32.988 --> 21:34.288
<i>Stop.</i>

21:34.322 --> 21:37.257
<i>Babe, you promise
you won't show anyone, right?</i>

21:37.292 --> 21:38.325
<i>Promise.</i>

21:38.360 --> 21:39.594
Uh, naked lady.

21:39.628 --> 21:41.261
Uh... Oh, my gosh.

21:41.296 --> 21:43.531
Why is this
on your phone?

21:43.565 --> 21:46.400
You are the youth of today,
and I do not understand you.

21:46.434 --> 21:48.835
I'm old.
I'm officially old.

21:48.870 --> 21:49.936
Man.

21:52.173 --> 21:53.440
What are you doing?

21:53.475 --> 21:54.674
No, I-I wasn't...

21:54.709 --> 21:56.776
There are kids in the hospital.
Can we focus?

21:56.811 --> 21:58.178
Yeah.
No, I was...

21:58.213 --> 22:01.048
[sighs]
There you go.

22:01.116 --> 22:03.416
Look, I already told you
there was nothing to see.

22:04.919 --> 22:06.419
You know what?
Don't rush it.

22:06.453 --> 22:09.389
Sometimes if you just relax,
even close your eyes,

22:09.456 --> 22:11.790
play it back,
you might remember something.

22:11.825 --> 22:14.960
I was playing ball, man.
I wasn't watching cars go by.

22:14.995 --> 22:17.296
Sure, but you're an athlete.
You got great reflexes.

22:17.364 --> 22:18.631
I'll bet when you heard
those gunshots,

22:18.665 --> 22:20.099
you looked to see
where they were coming from.

22:20.134 --> 22:23.301
Even if I did,
I'm not a snitch.

22:23.336 --> 22:26.104
Ramon, doing the right thing
isn't being a snitch.

22:26.172 --> 22:28.473
You're putting a guy in jail
that hurts people.

22:28.508 --> 22:31.510
I want to play baseball.

22:31.578 --> 22:34.312
But I have to stay alive
to do that.

22:34.380 --> 22:37.683
Look, can I just see him?
I really need to see him.

22:37.751 --> 22:40.652
Michie, you can make
such a difference here.

22:40.719 --> 22:42.854
You were on the field
when the shooter fired.

22:42.922 --> 22:45.890
Your boyfriend got caught up
in a turf war.

22:45.958 --> 22:47.292
You think
they're after Raj

22:47.360 --> 22:49.461
because he was connected
to Kill Street.

22:49.495 --> 22:52.531
That silver S.U.V...
you ever seen it before?

22:52.598 --> 22:55.466
Yeah...
belongs to Boz Shepherd.

22:55.534 --> 22:57.569
Did you happen to see
who was driving it today?

23:00.005 --> 23:02.373
You want me to say
it was Boz.

23:03.909 --> 23:06.044
And what if I did?
He'd be out in a week.

23:06.111 --> 23:08.012
No, he won't.
We got two kids down.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.782
The shooter would be going away
for at least 20 years.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.183
20 years.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.384
Michie.

23:14.953 --> 23:16.520
Did you see the shooter?

23:18.557 --> 23:20.791
Look, I know that you're scared,
but you got to know

23:20.858 --> 23:23.127
that we would do everything
we can to protect you.

23:23.161 --> 23:24.495
What about my brother,
my family?

23:24.563 --> 23:25.829
How are you
gonna protect them?

23:25.863 --> 23:27.331
Well, by identifying
the shooter,

23:27.399 --> 23:29.365
that really is your best chance
of keeping them safe.

23:29.433 --> 23:31.101
It really is.

23:35.339 --> 23:37.975
It was Boz.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.510
He was driving.

23:40.578 --> 23:42.079
It was Boz.

23:43.414 --> 23:45.148
[clears throat]

23:46.984 --> 23:48.884
- We got him.
- What about Henry Kim?

23:48.919 --> 23:50.853
Well, if Kim knows
Boz got I.D.'d,

23:50.887 --> 23:53.022
he just might
change his story, right?

23:53.090 --> 23:55.458
You know, Boz is a talented guy,
but he's not magic.

23:55.526 --> 23:57.560
He can't be in two places
at the same time.

23:57.595 --> 23:59.262
Yeah, we've got him
at the crime scene.

23:59.296 --> 24:01.097
An eyewitness I.D.'d him
about an hour ago.

24:01.164 --> 24:03.298
Which means
either our witness is lying

24:03.366 --> 24:06.002
or you may have been confused
about this morning.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.104
Someone saw him
at the baseball field?

24:08.138 --> 24:09.204
Yes, they did.

24:09.272 --> 24:11.573
The Jameson Gang
isn't that strong.

24:11.608 --> 24:13.009
If Boz goes away,

24:13.043 --> 24:14.944
we're gonna have a field day
picking off the rest of them.

24:14.978 --> 24:16.445
You're gonna get
your neighborhood back.

24:16.479 --> 24:18.113
You'll be the boss
of your own business again.

24:18.148 --> 24:21.250
Yeah, all you have to do
is just tell the truth.

24:22.318 --> 24:24.253
Okay, so maybe
I <i>didn't</i> see him.

24:24.287 --> 24:26.388
If I'm gonna put Boz away
for good,

24:26.422 --> 24:28.690
I'm gonna need
a clear statement from you.

24:28.724 --> 24:31.260
I didn't see him
this morning.

24:31.294 --> 24:32.594
Boz wasn't here.

24:32.629 --> 24:34.095
You're sure?

24:37.900 --> 24:40.135
Okay. Thank you.

24:40.169 --> 24:41.703
Gail,
it's like you said...

24:41.737 --> 24:43.972
all he needed to do
was tell the truth.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

24:58.389 --> 24:59.522
Hi.

24:59.557 --> 25:01.458
Hey.

25:01.492 --> 25:03.227
[exhales deeply]
Wow.

25:07.031 --> 25:08.465
What'd you have for breakfast
this morning?

25:08.532 --> 25:09.532
I'm sorry... what?

25:09.567 --> 25:10.934
Sorry.
Can I see your phone?

25:11.002 --> 25:11.868
No.

25:11.902 --> 25:14.036
Uh...
Let me rephrase that.

25:14.071 --> 25:16.038
You wouldn't happen to have
anything on your phone

25:16.073 --> 25:18.308
that you would, you know,
E-mail to a friend

25:18.376 --> 25:22.044
or show your Uncle Gary,
do you?

25:22.112 --> 25:23.413
Of course not.

25:23.447 --> 25:24.914
Okay,
so you've deleted everything?

25:24.948 --> 25:25.715
Yeah.

25:25.783 --> 25:26.716
I think so.

25:26.784 --> 25:28.550
Are you 1,000% sure?

25:28.585 --> 25:29.685
I could double-check.

25:29.753 --> 25:31.353
Yes, please. Yes.

25:31.421 --> 25:35.992
Because memories fade,
but pictures... linger...

25:36.059 --> 25:37.193
if you know what I mean.

25:37.227 --> 25:39.162
Yeah, I mean,
that night on the boat...

25:39.229 --> 25:40.396
that's never gonna fade.

25:40.430 --> 25:42.364
From your memory, right?
Not your phone?

25:42.399 --> 25:44.200
Because if those pictures
are on your phone,

25:44.268 --> 25:45.601
you need to find
those pictures

25:45.669 --> 25:47.303
and you need to delete
those pictures.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.337
Okay?

25:48.405 --> 25:49.772
I mean,
not that I regret it,

25:49.806 --> 25:51.840
because my body was
pretty bangin' that night.

25:51.908 --> 25:53.108
[chuckles]

25:53.142 --> 25:54.943
So was yours,
but I'm a police officer, right?

25:55.011 --> 25:57.012
There's a certain standard
of professionalism

25:57.079 --> 25:58.246
that we have to uphold.

25:58.315 --> 25:59.748
[sighs]

25:59.816 --> 26:02.550
Chloe, rest assured
there is no evidence on my phone

26:02.584 --> 26:05.287
that we ever even met.

26:05.354 --> 26:07.455
That's sad.

26:07.523 --> 26:09.390
But good. That's good.

26:09.425 --> 26:10.458
[clears throat]

26:10.526 --> 26:11.592
Whew. Okay.

26:11.627 --> 26:13.428
So, now that
we've cleared that up,

26:13.495 --> 26:15.496
I can now go give a lecture
to a teenager

26:15.564 --> 26:18.633
from a non-hypocritical place
of wisdom.

26:18.701 --> 26:20.167
Okay.

26:20.235 --> 26:21.536
[door opens]

26:21.603 --> 26:23.738
Oh, hey, and, Dov,

26:23.806 --> 26:27.475
feel free to use whatever is
up in the ol' memory bank

26:27.543 --> 26:30.445
for, you know,
those, uh, lonely times.

26:55.470 --> 26:56.570
[Michie sighs]

26:56.604 --> 26:58.304
Hey. She all done
with her statement?

26:58.339 --> 27:00.707
Yeah, I'm just taking her
to the hospital right now

27:00.742 --> 27:02.175
to see the boyfriend.

27:02.243 --> 27:04.077
They're booking Boz now.

27:04.111 --> 27:05.278
Look, can we go?

27:05.312 --> 27:06.847
Hey, Michie.

27:06.881 --> 27:08.915
You asked if it was Boz,
and I told you it was Boz.

27:08.949 --> 27:10.783
You said you'd take care
of me and my brother.

27:10.817 --> 27:12.418
No, no, we <i>will...</i>

27:12.452 --> 27:14.687
because you're telling us
the truth, right?

27:14.755 --> 27:16.589
STEVE: Gail.

27:16.623 --> 27:18.157
It's all right.

27:21.461 --> 27:22.929
What are you doing?

27:22.963 --> 27:25.398
I feel very weird
about it.

27:25.432 --> 27:27.099
Michie's acting
very strange.

27:27.133 --> 27:29.802
Henry changes his story because
he heard we had a witness.

27:29.836 --> 27:30.636
Yeah?

27:30.670 --> 27:32.638
Well, what if...

27:32.672 --> 27:34.673
what if Raj wasn't
the intended victim?

27:34.708 --> 27:37.610
Raj was
the only potential target.

27:37.644 --> 27:40.178
If he was the intended target,
why would you keep shooting?

27:40.213 --> 27:41.446
Don't do this,
okay?

27:41.480 --> 27:42.814
Do what?

27:42.882 --> 27:44.816
Hey, Steve, I want to get Boz
just as much as you do.

27:44.850 --> 27:47.019
Yeah.
And we got him.

27:47.053 --> 27:49.687
We got him.
So don't dig.

27:51.424 --> 27:54.492
You know, you're not the one
that screwed up last time.

27:54.527 --> 27:57.862
There's been three drive-bys
since he walked, okay? Two dead.

27:57.897 --> 27:59.330
That wasn't your fault.

27:59.364 --> 28:00.432
It <i>was.</i>

28:00.499 --> 28:01.933
I had the guy
but not the paperwork.

28:01.967 --> 28:03.401
Okay, this time,
I got it all.

28:12.945 --> 28:16.280
Okay.
So, we are letting you go.

28:16.315 --> 28:17.448
CHLOE: What? Why?

28:17.482 --> 28:20.150
They found an eyewitness
for Boz Shepherd.

28:20.217 --> 28:22.218
You will get this back,

28:22.253 --> 28:26.189
but first, you are getting
a piece of advice.

28:26.223 --> 28:28.691
Well, you need to tell whoever
sent you this that it is not okay.

28:28.759 --> 28:31.428
Sure. He's lying in a hospital bed
with a gunshot wound.

28:31.495 --> 28:32.862
But if Boris survives,

28:32.896 --> 28:34.730
I'll let him know
you don't approve.

28:34.765 --> 28:36.231
Boris sent you
this video?

28:36.266 --> 28:37.266
What video?

28:37.300 --> 28:39.301
A nudie video
of his girlfriend.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.070
Boris sent it around
last night.

28:41.137 --> 28:43.940
Are you...
talking about Michie?

28:43.974 --> 28:45.007
Yeah.

28:45.075 --> 28:46.742
Apparently,
it went viral.

28:53.950 --> 28:56.452
You sure about this?

28:56.486 --> 28:58.187
Don't know yet.

28:58.254 --> 29:00.089
Does Steve know
you're here?

29:13.603 --> 29:14.803
How's he doing?

29:14.871 --> 29:18.607
Doctor said
he's gonna be all right.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.609
You really love him?

29:20.676 --> 29:24.278
He's an idiot
most of the time, but...

29:24.346 --> 29:25.513
yeah.

29:25.580 --> 29:26.947
I do.

29:28.450 --> 29:31.952
Do Boris and your brother
get along?

29:32.021 --> 29:34.122
It's Winston, right?
That's your brother.

29:35.724 --> 29:37.258
They do all right.

29:37.292 --> 29:39.593
You know,
I looked into your brother,

29:39.661 --> 29:41.162
and I noticed, uh...

29:41.196 --> 29:43.363
he hangs with Boz's crew
a little bit, doesn't he?

29:44.365 --> 29:46.800
Sometimes. Not really.

29:46.835 --> 29:48.035
He's in the system.

29:48.069 --> 29:50.538
He has a few arrests
but no convictions.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.641
Does he look out for you?

29:53.708 --> 29:56.677
I look out for <i>myself.</i>

30:05.786 --> 30:08.321
When you asked me how long
the shooter would serve,

30:08.356 --> 30:11.291
I really thought
you were asking me about Boz.

30:11.325 --> 30:12.859
I was.

30:12.893 --> 30:14.261
My older brother,
Steve...

30:14.328 --> 30:16.262
he nearly caught Boz
about like six months ago,

30:16.296 --> 30:19.198
and then something went wrong
with the paperwork,

30:19.266 --> 30:21.167
and Boz went free.

30:23.671 --> 30:26.940
This arrest
means <i>everything</i> to him.

30:26.974 --> 30:30.309
And now it looks like
I might take that away.

30:32.212 --> 30:36.348
Your brother must have been
devastated by that video.

30:36.383 --> 30:37.649
Look,
it's not a big deal.

30:37.684 --> 30:39.151
Come on, Michie.
That's...

30:39.186 --> 30:41.687
a video like that,
that's a <i>very</i> big deal.

30:41.721 --> 30:44.656
And I know that if there was
a video like that of <i>me,</i>

30:44.691 --> 30:46.192
my brother would lose it.

30:47.894 --> 30:50.929
He said Boris was
making me do things...

30:50.964 --> 30:53.198
that weren't right.

30:53.232 --> 30:55.601
But it's on <i>me,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

30:55.635 --> 30:57.302
I knew
Boris was taking the video.

30:57.336 --> 30:58.570
No, y-you didn't know

30:58.605 --> 31:00.606
that he was gonna send it
to all his friends.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.975
That's not on you.

31:03.009 --> 31:06.644
Michie, there are gonna be
a lot of cops out there.

31:06.712 --> 31:08.146
They're gonna be
knocking on doors

31:08.180 --> 31:11.316
and asking if anybody saw
your brother using Boz's S.U.V.,

31:11.350 --> 31:12.584
and I'm sorry,

31:12.618 --> 31:14.619
but Winston does not have
the rep that Boz does,

31:14.653 --> 31:16.187
so someone's
gonna say something.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.124
It was Boz who shot up
the field. I told you.

31:19.158 --> 31:20.725
Boris and Raj...
they're fine.

31:20.792 --> 31:24.595
Yeah, that's great.
I'm... I'm... I'm glad.

31:24.630 --> 31:27.732
It doesn't mean you can put
the wrong person behind bars.

31:29.234 --> 31:31.502
My brother's a good guy.

31:31.569 --> 31:34.605
He opened fire
at innocent people.

31:38.709 --> 31:40.477
Now, I can help you.

31:41.646 --> 31:43.280
I <i>can.</i>

31:43.348 --> 31:46.450
I can help both you and Winston,
but only if he surrenders.

31:48.686 --> 31:51.522
You want me
to turn my brother in?

31:51.589 --> 31:54.658
I want you
to do what's right.

32:01.365 --> 32:05.168
Michie.
Come on. Let's go home.

32:05.202 --> 32:07.236
Winston Brewer...

32:07.304 --> 32:08.638
you're under arrest

32:08.706 --> 32:11.807
for two counts
of attempted murder.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.476
MICHIE:
You shouldn't have done it.

32:13.510 --> 32:16.945
I didn't need you
to defend me.

32:17.013 --> 32:18.514
[police radio chatter]

32:18.582 --> 32:21.083
You're supposed to watch out
for your family.

32:21.117 --> 32:23.319
I know.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.188
GAIL: Winston Brewer,
two counts of attempted murder.

32:34.597 --> 32:37.998
I appreciate you putting the car
back where you found it, Win.

32:38.066 --> 32:40.334
But shooting up
a neighborhood game?

32:40.368 --> 32:42.169
- Man, that's just cold.
- Get out.

32:42.237 --> 32:44.271
Traci.

32:47.350 --> 32:49.543
Is Boz aware of
any of the behind-the-scenes?

32:49.611 --> 32:51.412
No. He only knows
what he just saw.

32:51.446 --> 32:53.814
Michie and the rest...
they're safe.

33:01.155 --> 33:03.189
You know
I had to do it.

33:03.224 --> 33:04.524
Oh, sure.
I know that.

33:04.592 --> 33:05.726
Steve...

33:05.793 --> 33:06.960
Gail,
he was right here.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.495
We could have
put that guy away,

33:08.529 --> 33:10.396
but now...
now he's back out there.

33:10.431 --> 33:11.664
Because he didn't do it.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.100
You know, I thought
we had each other's back.

33:14.168 --> 33:17.470
Yeah, same team
for the first time.

33:17.505 --> 33:18.571
I did.

33:18.606 --> 33:19.405
No.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.274
No, I guess not.

33:26.780 --> 33:28.881
Lauralee said
you needed a visit.

33:28.915 --> 33:30.082
Hey!

33:30.117 --> 33:32.018
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

33:32.052 --> 33:35.154
LAURALEE: Sophie,
you know what Gail did today?

33:35.188 --> 33:37.523
She was a hero.

33:37.557 --> 33:40.126
She saved a girl
without even knowing her.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.794
She didn't even
think twice.

33:41.828 --> 33:43.094
No big deal.
[chuckles]

33:43.129 --> 33:44.429
[chuckling] Whoa.

33:44.464 --> 33:45.830
What was her name?

33:45.865 --> 33:47.266
Michie.

33:47.300 --> 33:48.400
I like that name.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.169
- You do?
- Yeah.

33:50.203 --> 33:51.403
We call my friend Michie,

33:51.437 --> 33:53.472
but the teachers
don't say her whole name.

33:53.506 --> 33:54.973
What's her whole name?

33:55.007 --> 33:56.841
- Michelle.
- Yeah?

33:56.876 --> 33:58.610
Thank you.

33:59.607 --> 34:00.979
Have her back by 7:00.

34:01.013 --> 34:02.313
Okay.

34:02.381 --> 34:03.648
You know what?

34:03.683 --> 34:06.484
There are no rules at my house.
Did you know that?

34:06.518 --> 34:07.852
- Nope.
- You know why?

34:07.887 --> 34:10.121
'Cause there's no adults
at my house.

34:10.156 --> 34:11.790
[chuckling]
What do you think about that?

34:11.824 --> 34:13.058
[chuckles]

34:22.501 --> 34:25.369
I think, uh,
we're almost done.

34:25.404 --> 34:26.637
Yeah.

34:26.705 --> 34:29.973
[both sigh]

34:30.007 --> 34:33.210
I don't know how I'm gonna
drag myself back up to that cabin.

34:36.647 --> 34:37.681
I'm sorry.

34:39.014 --> 34:40.036
For what?

34:40.069 --> 34:41.885
I just, uh...

34:41.920 --> 34:44.487
kind of wanted this weekend
to be perfect, you know?

34:44.554 --> 34:46.857
Everything...

34:46.891 --> 34:48.058
just so.

34:49.594 --> 34:51.728
And, uh, it's kind of been
like the last six months,

34:51.762 --> 34:53.161
you know,
in a little bottle...

34:53.197 --> 34:57.366
best of intentions,
but...

34:57.400 --> 34:59.201
it's just a disaster.

35:01.504 --> 35:03.606
But you're still here.

35:06.509 --> 35:08.544
I like this weekend.

35:11.247 --> 35:13.548
I'll have you know
I love killing birds.

35:13.582 --> 35:15.350
And one of
my favorite things

35:15.417 --> 35:18.086
is getting poison ivy
all over my body.

35:18.154 --> 35:21.589
This is
better than perfect.

35:23.684 --> 35:25.384
It's us.

35:27.463 --> 35:29.631
Come on. Let's get back
to the cabin, all right?

35:29.698 --> 35:31.098
Fire up the barbecue.

35:31.166 --> 35:32.600
I don't care who cooks.

35:32.668 --> 35:35.370
Actually, I do care...
you.

35:42.782 --> 35:46.613
Marry me... Mcnally.

35:49.450 --> 35:51.485
Oh, my God.

35:53.155 --> 35:55.455
McNally?

35:58.760 --> 36:00.960
[chuckles]

36:00.995 --> 36:02.228
[chuckling] Yes.

36:02.263 --> 36:04.298
- Yes?
- [laughing] Yes.

36:08.235 --> 36:09.135
Yes?

36:09.170 --> 36:10.904
Yeah.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.774
[sighs]

36:13.808 --> 36:16.443
[exhales deeply]

36:37.849 --> 36:40.988
Well, a few hours ago, this was
a crime scene, all right?

36:41.076 --> 36:44.938
But right now and tomorrow,
the day after that,

36:45.048 --> 36:46.255
it's still gonna be
a baseball field.

36:46.290 --> 36:49.158
It's gonna be, uh, the only
baseball field these kids got.

36:49.193 --> 36:50.493
You know?

36:50.528 --> 36:52.495
So let's get out there
and get it back into shape.

36:52.530 --> 36:54.564
Let them know that we haven't
forgotten about them.

36:54.598 --> 36:55.665
Let's go.

37:01.330 --> 37:02.504
Hey.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.081
Come on in, guys.

37:13.889 --> 37:15.283
Hey.

37:18.755 --> 37:20.689
I'll take that.

37:22.091 --> 37:23.291
Yeah.

37:23.326 --> 37:24.593
Throw it around.

37:24.661 --> 37:26.829
Nice.

37:31.311 --> 37:33.869
You guys, too.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.779
Well, it's not such a bad night
after all.

37:44.813 --> 37:46.381
Mnh-mnh.

37:48.950 --> 37:52.152
Even though it does
still smell like a zoo.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.354
Mm.

37:53.389 --> 37:55.823
Go with "earthy"...

37:55.891 --> 37:57.825
"primal."

37:57.893 --> 37:59.093
Right.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.561
Appropriate, no?

38:00.629 --> 38:01.529
Right.

38:01.597 --> 38:03.097
[chuckles]

38:04.332 --> 38:06.166
It is what it is.

38:06.234 --> 38:08.468
Which is why it's perfect.

38:10.005 --> 38:13.307
[sighs]

38:13.375 --> 38:16.210
You know what'd make it
more perfect?

38:16.244 --> 38:18.712
If you would tell me
about Juliet.

38:21.215 --> 38:23.249
[chuckles]

38:23.317 --> 38:24.718
You are relentless.

38:24.786 --> 38:26.753
It's one of the reasons
why you love me so much.

38:26.788 --> 38:27.587
Yeah.

38:27.655 --> 38:29.489
Mm-hmm.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.725
What makes you think
I know anything about Juliet?

38:31.759 --> 38:34.127
[scoffs]

38:34.161 --> 38:35.796
Because you told me
to let it go.

38:35.863 --> 38:37.096
Right.

38:37.164 --> 38:39.065
You never say that
unless you're hiding something.

38:39.099 --> 38:42.268
♪ To see
that you were sleeping ♪

38:42.303 --> 38:44.103
[clears throat]

38:44.171 --> 38:45.939
Hmm?

38:45.973 --> 38:49.475
After the explosion
in the evidence room...

38:49.543 --> 38:50.843
Yes,
where I almost died

38:50.877 --> 38:54.780
and you remembered why
you love me so much... again.

38:54.815 --> 38:56.749
[chuckles]

38:56.783 --> 38:59.585
...and Ted McDonald
was found dead...

39:01.287 --> 39:03.889
I really shouldn't
be talking about this.

39:03.924 --> 39:05.658
Really?

39:05.692 --> 39:07.159
I mean...

39:07.193 --> 39:08.894
I-I couldn't
stop thinking...

39:08.929 --> 39:10.562
All right.
[clears throat]

39:10.596 --> 39:12.965
I-I-I couldn't stop thinking
about everything

39:12.999 --> 39:15.800
that Ted was saying about
corruption in 15 Division...

39:15.835 --> 39:17.902
about it being
Commissioner Santana...

39:17.937 --> 39:19.737
the fish
stinking from the head.

39:19.772 --> 39:22.040
And then all of his evidence
blows up.

39:22.075 --> 39:24.076
Mm-hmm.

39:26.512 --> 39:29.413
If it's true...

39:29.448 --> 39:32.750
it's a very tricky
investigation.

39:32.785 --> 39:33.751
[sighs]

39:33.819 --> 39:35.419
So I went
to a good friend...

39:35.454 --> 39:38.222
someone I absolutely trust
in Internal Affairs...

39:38.256 --> 39:40.792
and I suggested
they look into it.

39:40.826 --> 39:44.528
I think Juliet might be
the I.A. officer they sent in.

39:44.562 --> 39:49.000
You really think
someone at 15 Division is dirty?

39:49.034 --> 39:50.201
Wait.

39:50.268 --> 39:53.137
Who's your good friend...
the one you trust?

39:53.171 --> 39:55.172
[sighs]

39:55.207 --> 39:58.142
The person that spends the most
time with Commissioner Santana

39:58.210 --> 39:59.443
is Inspector Jarvis.

39:59.478 --> 40:02.312
He goes above and beyond.

40:02.346 --> 40:05.415
He seems to be
in the back of Santana's pocket.

40:05.449 --> 40:10.053
And I know
that that might seem obvious,

40:10.087 --> 40:11.588
but I do think
that it's unusual.

40:11.623 --> 40:13.289
Jarvis is opportunistic
and ambitious,

40:13.324 --> 40:14.791
but that doesn't
make him dirty.

40:14.826 --> 40:16.126
You got anything else
on him?

40:16.193 --> 40:18.328
No, because I think
that there's others

40:18.396 --> 40:20.163
that are
even more suspicious.

40:20.197 --> 40:21.164
Like?

40:21.198 --> 40:22.499
Chris Diaz.

40:22.566 --> 40:25.935
Just got out of rehab
for cocaine addiction, and...

40:26.003 --> 40:28.304
he's sleeping
with Jarvis' wife.

40:28.339 --> 40:30.606
Diaz?
You're bringing me Diaz?

40:30.674 --> 40:32.775
Well, I'm saying
that it's suspicious behavior.

40:32.843 --> 40:34.911
He's just traded
one addiction for another.

40:34.945 --> 40:36.211
He'll get over it.

40:36.246 --> 40:37.446
Okay.

40:37.514 --> 40:39.515
Well, we can't ignore
Duncan Moore.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.483
I mean, he's dumb
as a bag of hammers,

40:41.552 --> 40:43.819
but he's also got
stepdaddy issues.

40:43.854 --> 40:45.888
He's certainly
under his stepdaddy's thumb,

40:45.956 --> 40:47.690
but do you think
Alonso would trust him

40:47.758 --> 40:49.058
not to screw things up?

40:50.126 --> 40:51.693
I couldn't say.

40:51.727 --> 40:53.862
What have you got, Ward?

40:53.930 --> 40:56.465
You didn't demand this meeting
to give me <i>this.</i>

40:57.767 --> 40:59.501
[sighs]

41:01.837 --> 41:03.838
Bomb was
on a 20-minute timer.

41:03.906 --> 41:06.240
You back it up
to the moment of the explosion,

41:06.275 --> 41:08.276
and you see
who enters the evidence room.

41:08.343 --> 41:09.711
We cleared those people.

41:09.779 --> 41:12.146
The ones who signed in,
sure.

41:12.214 --> 41:15.717
But there are other people
that have key cards,

41:15.785 --> 41:18.987
and someone used their key card
20 minutes before the bomb blew.

41:21.190 --> 41:23.657
And if you didn't like
any of those other names...

41:25.360 --> 41:27.828
...you're gonna hate
this one.

41:27.862 --> 41:29.397
It was Oliver Shaw.
