WEBVTT

00:00.091 --> 00:01.318
Thank you.

00:01.319 --> 00:03.380
Stop trying to calm me
down. You're not good at it.

00:03.390 --> 00:05.280
I'm just saying, there's no
reason to be nervous.

00:05.290 --> 00:06.330
Joey, it's Match Day.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.219
They're gonna hand me a piece of paper

00:08.220 --> 00:09.370
telling me where I'm doing my residency.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.180
I understand.

00:11.190 --> 00:12.379
It's literally the turning
point in my life,

00:12.380 --> 00:14.280
both the world's assessment of my past

00:14.290 --> 00:15.280
and a map of my future.

00:15.290 --> 00:16.300
It's my whole life.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.220
That's an awfully dramatic
way to put it.

00:18.230 --> 00:20.240
That's because you're not
good at calming me down.

00:20.250 --> 00:23.330
Pathology at Chicago
Med is your top choice.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.380
Everyone here thinks very highly of you.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.219
You're at the top of your class.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.280
Plus you are extremely attractive.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.170
- Joey.
- Reese.

00:31.180 --> 00:34.179
It's going to be pathology.

00:34.180 --> 00:37.189
You'll be down in the basement with me.

00:37.190 --> 00:39.300
I'm still not calm.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.260
Well, I-I really don't mean to nag,

00:41.270 --> 00:43.330
but I think it's important.

00:43.340 --> 00:44.380
I understand.

00:44.390 --> 00:47.290
I know it's what
Jeffrey would have wanted.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.330
I'll think about it, okay?

00:53.350 --> 00:54.380
Bye, sweetie.

00:54.390 --> 00:57.330
I'll see you later.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.240
All right.

01:09.390 --> 01:11.270
[sighs]

01:11.280 --> 01:13.220
Hey.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.180
How are you doing?

01:15.190 --> 01:17.330
Fine.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.240
Really?

01:20.250 --> 01:21.399
Jennifer Baker.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.180
The drug trial I got her on,

01:24.190 --> 01:26.199
I found out they're
giving her a placebo.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.400
Oh, Will, I'm sorry.

01:28.170 --> 01:32.230
They're treating her
cancer with sugar water.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.280
How are you doing?

01:33.290 --> 01:37.360
Well, my mother-in-law
is driving me crazy.

01:37.370 --> 01:38.400
Cloth diapers again?

01:39.170 --> 01:40.180
No.

01:40.190 --> 01:42.199
She wants me to get Owen christened.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.220
So?

01:43.230 --> 01:45.240
She's Catholic. It's what we do.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.279
So was Jeff.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.350
Lapsed Catholic.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.240
And he hated parochial school.

01:49.250 --> 01:52.220
Always told me horror
stories about all the nuns.

01:52.230 --> 01:53.319
Eh, we all tell those stories.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.340
Doesn't mean a thing.

01:54.350 --> 01:56.199
Hey, take it from a formal altar boy.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.340
Baptism's a piece of cake.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.210
A lot easier than a briss.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.169
But I'm not religious.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.310
Wouldn't it be hypocritical?

02:02.320 --> 02:04.210
Eh, think of it like a vaccination.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.369
Do it and get it over with.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.229
Hey, this is my world.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.329
I'll make a few calls, hook you up.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.329
We'll do this together.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.200
- [alert beeping]
- Incoming.

02:12.210 --> 02:15.289
[indistinct P.A. announcements]

02:15.290 --> 02:17.209
Lisa Patrick, early 30's.

02:17.210 --> 02:18.350
Penetrating head wound from falling ice

02:18.360 --> 02:19.350
off the Citadel Center.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.170
Tubed in the field.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.169
BP's 90 over 50, GCS
3. That's her husband.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.289
Dr. Rhodes, you're going to Baghdad.

02:24.290 --> 02:26.170
We were just walking down the street.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.240
It fell out of nowhere.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.350
Tell radiology we're sending
them a head CT.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.289
Got it.

02:31.290 --> 02:33.369
Set her up on tele and get a pulse ox.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.289
- Easy.
- Set on my count.

02:35.290 --> 02:36.390
One, two, three.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.249
- Oh, God, is she gonna be okay?
- Maggie...

02:39.250 --> 02:41.219
Sir, I'm gonna need
you to step to the side.

02:41.220 --> 02:42.379
They're gonna do everything they can.

02:42.380 --> 02:45.220
Gonna need an O2 sat.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.339
She's completely unresponsive.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.299
- Pupils are fixed and dilated.
- Her head is crushed.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.210
The ice is penetrating through the side

02:51.220 --> 02:52.260
and the back of her skull.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.379
Yeah, looks like the
ice clipped the carotid.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.219
It's up against the
wound, but if we move it,

02:55.220 --> 02:56.290
she'll start to pump.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.370
And the ice is
melting, we've got a minute,

02:57.380 --> 02:59.240
two minutes tops, and
then she'll bleed out.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.219
All right, we got to
clamp off the carotid now.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.180
Well, without a scan, we
don't know what we're dealing with.

03:03.190 --> 03:04.260
Agreed, but we don't have time.

03:04.270 --> 03:05.339
No, you're right. Let's do it.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.210
All right, chest and plastics tray.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.260
We're gonna explore the neck
to get control of the artery.

03:09.270 --> 03:10.320
All right, I'll get suction.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.179
She's bleeding faster.

03:12.180 --> 03:13.290
All right, turn her. But gently.

03:13.300 --> 03:17.220
If that ice moves, she's
gonna gush like a hose.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.259
- Knife.
- Here, doctor.

03:22.260 --> 03:25.390
Okay, here we go.

03:26.582 --> 03:31.783
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

03:32.310 --> 03:34.339
There's too much blood.
I can't see the carotid.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.490
Feel like your surgical residency again?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.470
Not in a good way.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.310
Bleeding's picking up.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.370
There it is.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.470
Damn it, I missed.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.300
Ice is melting.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.460
Suction can't keep up with the bleeding.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.460
- All right, gauze.
- 4 by 4.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.349
Wait, wait, wait, look.

03:51.350 --> 03:53.290
Yup, there.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.390
- Clamp.
- Clamp.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.340
All right.

03:56.350 --> 03:57.370
Pull with the Richardson.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.330
I need a little more exposure.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.340
Uh-huh.

04:00.350 --> 04:03.350
One more.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.310
And there.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.439
Got it. Bleeding's stopped.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.450
Let's cover it up and
get her up to CT now.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.519
Nice work.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.519
Crushed skull.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.350
Too much damage.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.500
She's never gonna wake up.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.519
- Page from Dr. Choi.
- He's in Trauma 1.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.440
- I want it off.
- That guy's crazy.

04:35.450 --> 04:37.360
I want it off! Please take it off.

04:37.370 --> 04:38.460
Tell ortho hand we're coming up.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.519
Get a CBC, ABG, chem panel and
type and cross him for four.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.359
Got it.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.350
- This is Mr. Tacker.
- He was in a hardware store.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.289
Grabbed a hatchet, tried
to hack his arm off.

04:46.290 --> 04:47.329
It's not me!

04:47.330 --> 04:48.449
Medics gave him a milligram of Versed

04:48.450 --> 04:49.490
and four morphine in the ambo.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.350
Mr. Tacker, I'm Dr. Charles.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.510
- What's going on?
- Can you cut it off?

04:52.520 --> 04:55.430
I'm not a surgeon, but
I'd like to try and help you.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.396
The only way you can help
me is if you cut off my arm!

04:58.397 --> 04:59.310
How bad's the injury?

04:59.320 --> 05:01.409
Cut through the radial artery,
but I think we can save the arm.

05:01.410 --> 05:03.400
No, no, no, no, please don't...

05:03.410 --> 05:06.289
Mr. Tacker, I promise you we'll
talk about this later,

05:06.290 --> 05:07.450
but right now, our
concern is your safety,

05:07.460 --> 05:09.289
so we got to get you up to surgery.

05:09.290 --> 05:11.409
No, no! Cut it off!

05:11.410 --> 05:13.430
- We'll talk later.
- I want it off!

05:13.440 --> 05:16.320
Any idea what that's about?

05:16.330 --> 05:17.449
Hmm.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.409
I definitely want to do a drug screen,

05:19.410 --> 05:22.310
but I think we might be dealing
with something else.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.370
Crazy. Poor guy.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.420
Mr. Patrick, I'm Dr. Halstead.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.480
I just saw your wife's scans.

05:37.490 --> 05:40.339
I'm afraid I have bad news.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.419
The damage is catastrophic.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.400
"Catastrophic"?

05:45.410 --> 05:48.380
Her heart is beating, but the ventilator

05:48.390 --> 05:52.299
is the only thing keeping her alive.

05:52.300 --> 05:56.520
I'm sorry, but her brain
is injured beyond repair.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.390
Lisa is never going to wake up.

06:02.470 --> 06:06.290
- I'm very sorry.
- No...

06:06.300 --> 06:08.450
No.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.469
Mr. Patrick, you
take as long as you need.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.469
Before we take your
wife off the ventilator,

06:13.470 --> 06:18.420
someone will be in to talk
to you about organ donation.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.450
Again, I'm so sorry.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.074

06:30.430 --> 06:32.300
[exhaling heavily]

06:32.310 --> 06:33.509
Agnes, let's call Gift of Hope.

06:33.510 --> 06:35.500
But we'll give him some
time to process this, okay?

06:35.510 --> 06:37.430
- Uh-huh.
- Thank you.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.450
Dr. Halstead.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.429
About organ donation?

06:41.430 --> 06:43.309
You don't have to think
about that right now.

06:43.310 --> 06:44.410
No.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.429
We've been trying to have a baby

06:46.430 --> 06:48.390
for months now.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.350
I read where you could
still use someone's eggs

06:50.360 --> 06:51.359
when they're like this.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.319
To make a baby.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.399
I believe so, yes.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.430
That's what I want to do.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.360
I want a baby.

06:58.370 --> 07:01.340
Our baby.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.340
Roger!

07:04.350 --> 07:06.439
Roge... Roger, I'm tired
of waiting on these bedpans.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.319
This is not something
people can do without.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.399
They better be.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.420
Or you're gonna be up
here mopping the floor.

07:13.430 --> 07:15.510
- Hey, Maggie.
- Uh-huh?

07:15.520 --> 07:18.310
You know anything about the Maldives?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.439
- The what?
- Chain of islands near India.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.310
Bert is retiring at the
end of the school year,

07:23.320 --> 07:27.310
so now he's on this,
uh, this big travel kick.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.340
Ah.

07:28.350 --> 07:30.110
A week at the beach sounds
pretty good to me.

07:30.290 --> 07:31.520
No, no, he's talking months.

07:32.290 --> 07:34.400
Wants to experience it like a local.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.290
And he thinks you're just gonna let him

07:36.300 --> 07:37.310
take off like that?

07:37.320 --> 07:40.440
He wants me to retire with him.

07:40.450 --> 07:42.289
What?

07:42.290 --> 07:43.409
Ms. Goodwin?

07:43.410 --> 07:44.480
Yes.

07:44.490 --> 07:47.410
We lost a patient this
morning, Lisa Patrick.

07:47.420 --> 07:50.390
Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.470
Do we have a protocol for that?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.360
We do.

07:53.370 --> 07:56.390
Ms. Patrick will have to be
on life support for two weeks

07:56.400 --> 07:58.480
for hormone stimulation therapy,

07:58.490 --> 08:00.449
followed by the retrieval itself.

08:00.450 --> 08:03.400
It's an expensive and
complicated procedure.

08:03.410 --> 08:04.489
Well, he seems pretty committed.

08:04.490 --> 08:06.490
He says his wife really
wanted to have a child.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.480
Well, I imagine she
meant she wanted a child

08:09.490 --> 08:11.290
she could mother and raise.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.440
This is a little different.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.198
A lot different.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.459
I'll call gynecology and
get the process started.

08:17.460 --> 08:20.379
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:20.380 --> 08:22.300
I didn't know what else to do.

08:22.310 --> 08:23.450
My ex-wife's in China.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.320
I, uh, couldn't get a hold of her,

08:25.330 --> 08:27.419
so I brought him here.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.490
Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.379
- Mr. Jenkins?
- Yes.

08:30.380 --> 08:32.370
And you must be Eric.

08:32.380 --> 08:33.499
I heard you swallowed some magnets.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.299
From a game I got on my desk.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.299
Like these.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.265
Sorry, I thought it was candy.

08:39.267 --> 08:41.450
I took my eyes off him for two
seconds to get a juice box.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.440
Kid's got quicker moves than me.

08:43.450 --> 08:45.500
Mr. Jenkins used to play for the Bears.

08:45.510 --> 08:48.450
Oh, yeah, I think I remember.

08:48.460 --> 08:51.290
My husband was a big football fan.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.339
So how many magnets did Eric swallow?

08:53.340 --> 08:54.469
Two, maybe three.

08:54.470 --> 08:56.380
It's probably nothing, right?

08:56.390 --> 08:57.509
When I was a kid, I swallowed a quarter.

08:57.510 --> 08:59.340
Went right through me.

08:59.350 --> 09:01.290
Have you had a tummy ache?

09:01.300 --> 09:03.389
Has he thrown anything up?

09:03.390 --> 09:04.469
How long ago did he swallow them?

09:04.470 --> 09:05.469
Couple hours.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.350
It's not serious, is it?

09:07.360 --> 09:09.389
Well, before I say that, I'd
like to take some pictures

09:09.390 --> 09:10.500
of Eric's belly, just to make sure

09:10.510 --> 09:12.510
that everything's moving through okay.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.300
Is that all right with you,

09:14.310 --> 09:16.290
if I take some pictures of your tummy?

09:16.300 --> 09:17.429
- Daddy?
- It's gonna be okay, son.

09:17.430 --> 09:19.429
- Don't worry.
- I want to go home.

09:19.430 --> 09:21.490
- Do what you need to.
- Hey, hey, Eric.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.509
Do you like to play
with building blocks?

09:23.510 --> 09:26.390
Because I happen to have the
biggest block collection

09:26.400 --> 09:27.509
in this whole hospital.

09:27.510 --> 09:28.510
Yeah? Okay.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.310
Stay right here.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.290
I think I have so many
blocks, I'm gonna need

09:32.300 --> 09:33.430
a truck to bring them in.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.460
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

09:37.450 --> 09:40.310
I'll check back in a little bit.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.480
- Full abdominal series?
- You got it.

09:44.490 --> 09:46.519
Nurse? Nurse?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.440
Hey, nurse!

09:49.450 --> 09:51.380
- Are you talking to me?
- Hello?

09:51.390 --> 09:53.390
Been here for two hours
with snot pouring out my nose.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.439
I'm sorry, but we need to
see patients in order of urgency.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.470
And I'm dying of a sinus infection.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.479
Maybe if you got off that
iPad and did a little work,

10:00.480 --> 10:01.519
things would go faster.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.359
Maybe you just need to wait your turn.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.439
And I'm not a nurse.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.760
Handled like a true pathologist.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.420
I know, I'm sorry.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.480
My Match Day, I threw up
six times and passed out,

10:12.490 --> 10:14.319
so I'd say you're doing fine.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.479
You did not throw up and pass out.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.350
Wanted to, though.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.329
Was emergency
medicine your first choice?

10:20.330 --> 10:21.409
My only choice.

10:21.410 --> 10:23.329
All I ever wanted to do.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.289
Even though it comes
with a lifetime supply of

10:25.290 --> 10:26.329
angry snot guys?

10:26.330 --> 10:28.480
Has it's downsides.

10:28.490 --> 10:30.360
Then again, how many jobs are there

10:30.370 --> 10:33.449
where you literally get to save lives?

10:33.450 --> 10:36.449
I'm sure you'll find
pathology just as rewarding.

10:36.450 --> 10:39.329
- You are?
- No.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.340
I don't get it at all.

10:50.490 --> 10:53.480
It's still there.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.289
Yeah.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.449
I guess they were able to save it.

10:57.450 --> 11:00.419
Oh, God.

11:00.420 --> 11:03.459
I'm sorry, it's,
uh... it's important to us

11:03.460 --> 11:06.440
that you don't hurt yourself.

11:06.450 --> 11:10.360
Mr. Tacker... I'm a psychiatrist

11:10.370 --> 11:12.380
and I'd very much like to help you.

11:12.390 --> 11:15.320
But I need to understand why

11:15.330 --> 11:18.320
you tried to... to sever your arm.

11:18.330 --> 11:19.459
I told you.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.420
It's not mine.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.480
It's not part of me.

11:23.490 --> 11:26.459
How long have you felt this way?

11:26.460 --> 11:28.419
Since I was a little boy.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.520
Four or five.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.460
I'd look at it and it just felt strange.

11:33.470 --> 11:37.370
Like it belonged to somebody else.

11:37.380 --> 11:41.349
It's like walking around
with something dead on me.

11:41.350 --> 11:42.470
Sounds terrible.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.469
I talked to a
doctor a couple months ago,

11:44.470 --> 11:47.410
asked him if he could remove it.

11:47.420 --> 11:50.300
He threw me out of his office.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.450
Told me I was crazy.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.469
But I'm not crazy.

11:55.470 --> 11:58.470
I've been on the
Internet. There are others like me.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.420
I've tried to cope. I just
can't stand it anymore.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.340
Mr. Tacker.

12:10.350 --> 12:14.340
If it's any comfort, I'm gonna
do everything I can to help you.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.380
So I got ahold of Father Brady.

12:29.390 --> 12:30.480
He's a sweet old guy.

12:30.490 --> 12:32.400
Of course, he asked
me when was the last time

12:32.410 --> 12:34.319
I went to confession.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.320
Anyway, he's pretty booked up,
but he says if we commit today,

12:37.330 --> 12:38.500
he can baptize Owen next Sunday.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.350
- That soon?
- Yeah.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.350
Dr. Halstead?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.360
I need to see you.

12:43.370 --> 12:46.300
Let me just think about it, okay?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.420
I just examined your patient
for the egg harvest protocol,

12:57.430 --> 13:00.359
and I can't in good
conscience go forward with it.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.430
Why?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.399
This woman didn't want to have children.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.320
Why would you say that?

13:05.330 --> 13:06.530
She was using birth control.

13:07.290 --> 13:08.510
Look.

13:13.490 --> 13:16.500
- An IUD.
- Mm-hmm.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.499
It's not true.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.609
I can show you the ultrasound.

13:26.610 --> 13:29.590
The IUD is definitely there.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.630
Maybe it's something else?

13:30.640 --> 13:32.529
A growth?

13:32.530 --> 13:35.520
Mr. Patrick, your
wife was on birth control.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.610
But it doesn't make sense.

13:37.620 --> 13:40.410
We were trying to start a family.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.610
I can understand how
hard this must be for you.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.459
No!

13:43.460 --> 13:46.460
We were tracking her
cycles, using ovulation kits.

13:46.470 --> 13:47.610
We had names picked out.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.579
I know how much you wanted a child.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.580
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

13:55.470 --> 13:58.450
And I'm sorry you can't ask her.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.410
Excuse me, sir.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.530
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.490
Oh, man...

14:13.550 --> 14:14.619
I'm so sorry.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.499
Oh, please, this is the
least disgusting thing

14:17.500 --> 14:18.499
I've cleaned up all day.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.610
[laughs]

14:19.620 --> 14:22.499
I, uh, wanted to thank you
for the way you calmed Eric down.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.630
Since his mom and I
split, he really doesn't

14:25.640 --> 14:27.510
get that sort of thing much.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.510
Well, it was my pleasure.

14:36.590 --> 14:38.420
He's falling for you.

14:38.430 --> 14:39.540
No, he isn't.

14:39.550 --> 14:42.500
I've seen that look a million times.

14:42.510 --> 14:45.500
His angel of mercy.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.589
Dr. Charles.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.509
What's the word on Mr. Tacker?

14:53.510 --> 14:56.580
No physical issues that would
make him want to self-amputate.

14:56.590 --> 14:59.460
His labs are clean, he's not on drugs.

14:59.470 --> 15:00.510
Psychotic.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.510
He is, in fact, entirely rational.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.430
Rational people do not try
to cut off their arms.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.639
I think he might be
suffering from a very rare condition,

15:09.640 --> 15:11.620
something I never dealt with before.

15:11.630 --> 15:13.600
B.I.I.D.

15:13.610 --> 15:17.470
Body Integrity Identity Disorder.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.630
Bear with me now.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.639
These people believe that
one of their limbs,

15:21.640 --> 15:25.439
a part of their body, is not their own.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.520
His sense of self does not extend

15:27.530 --> 15:29.460
to the fingers of his left arm.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.500
It stops at the elbow.

15:31.510 --> 15:33.599
[chuckles]

15:33.600 --> 15:34.620
Sorry.

15:34.630 --> 15:36.479
Sounds a little out there to me.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.550
I mean, who are any of us
to say where we end, right?

15:39.560 --> 15:41.420
Or begin?

15:41.430 --> 15:44.519
I mean, physicists will tell
you there's no physical self at all.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.519
Right?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.590
Just waves of energy.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.590
A mystic will say that
we're all one big soup.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.609
I'm not a physicist or a mystic.

15:51.610 --> 15:54.530
I'm a doc who's spent his
career treating wounded soldiers

15:54.540 --> 15:57.609
who begged me, "Save
my leg, save my arm."

15:57.610 --> 15:59.569
You don't think you
should commit this guy?

15:59.570 --> 16:01.510
At this point, my
only option is to put him

16:01.520 --> 16:03.520
on a 72-hour suicide hold.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.470
And then I got to let him go home.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.569
And then what?

16:06.570 --> 16:08.520
He'll try it again?

16:08.530 --> 16:10.520
Unless I can find a way to treat him.

16:15.450 --> 16:16.550
Will.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.550
Hey.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.550
What'd you decide?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.600
Should I call Father Brady?

16:19.610 --> 16:22.609
No, it's, uh, it's something else.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.550
Jennifer Baker.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.430
I heard from a trial nurse.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.449
What?

16:27.450 --> 16:29.459
She's going downhill.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.560
Fast.

16:31.570 --> 16:34.460
I'm sorry.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.579
I know it was coming.

16:35.580 --> 16:38.580
But still...

16:40.500 --> 16:42.600
If I'd just left her alone,

16:42.610 --> 16:44.610
she would've been spared all of this.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.420
Dr. Manning.

16:46.430 --> 16:48.440
The little boy, Eric
Jenkins, his x-rays are up.

16:48.450 --> 16:50.419
Better take a look.

16:50.420 --> 16:51.450
Page Dr. Rhodes, please.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.450
Will do.

16:54.620 --> 16:57.410
I'll talk to you later.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.450
And arms up.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.419
So they ever give you guys breaks?

17:09.420 --> 17:11.619
Only as often as the state requires.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.579
Maybe after Eric gets the all-clear,

17:13.589 --> 17:15.589
we could go out for coffee sometime?

17:15.589 --> 17:16.628
I'll try not to spill it on you.

17:16.630 --> 17:18.469
[laughs]

17:18.470 --> 17:20.569
That's really sweet,
but we're discouraged

17:20.579 --> 17:23.530
from going out with our
patients or their families.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.460
I won't tell if you won't.

17:26.470 --> 17:29.509
Um... oh, gosh, I'm sorry, Eric.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.410
I... there is this
thing called transference.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.620
Um, people develop
feelings for their caregivers.

17:34.630 --> 17:35.620
It's not real.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.509
[knocking]

17:37.510 --> 17:39.470
Hi, Mr. Jenkins, I'm Dr. Rhodes.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.589
Dr. Manning's asked me to consult.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.509
Would you mind stepping
out for a minute?

17:42.510 --> 17:43.630
- Sure.
- Thanks.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.420
Eric, can you show
me what you just made?

17:46.430 --> 17:47.460
What is that?

17:47.470 --> 17:49.549
These are Eric's
x-rays, and these two dots

17:49.550 --> 17:50.580
are the magnets.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.430
They're attracted to one another,

17:52.440 --> 17:54.510
and if they meet, they
could pin separate parts

17:54.520 --> 17:56.550
of his digestive tract
together and erode through

17:56.560 --> 17:57.630
the thin intestinal walls.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.620
Which could cause systemic infection,

18:00.630 --> 18:02.550
obstruction, bleeding.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.339
And any of those things could
be life-threatening.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.639
All right, so... okay, so,
um, so what should we do?

18:08.640 --> 18:11.560
In my opinion, we
should remove them surgically.

18:11.570 --> 18:12.620
Now.

18:12.630 --> 18:14.519
But isn't surgery kind of risky, too?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.639
Uh, yes, there is the possibility
of adhesions,

18:16.640 --> 18:17.639
motility issues.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.600
What does that mean?

18:19.610 --> 18:22.519
His digestive tract wouldn't
work as well.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.520
The argument for surgery outweighs
the possible risks.

18:25.530 --> 18:26.580
Every minute that we wait

18:26.590 --> 18:28.620
increases the chance of a bad outcome.

18:28.630 --> 18:31.439
I still can't reach my ex-wife.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.559
I should talk to her first.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.450
Why don't you think about it?

18:34.460 --> 18:36.780
I'll monitor Eric closely, we'll
get another set of x-rays,

18:37.410 --> 18:38.610
and then we'll check
back in a little bit, okay?

18:38.620 --> 18:41.630
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:43.410 --> 18:46.450
Natalie.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.530
The kid needs surgery.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.630
Surgery could leave him
with a lifetime of complications.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.600
It's not an easy decision to make,

18:51.610 --> 18:54.449
and that dad has to make
it all on his own.

18:54.450 --> 18:57.570
You have no idea how difficult that is.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.610
[thudding and crashing]

19:02.620 --> 19:04.530
[rapid electronic beeping]

19:04.540 --> 19:06.409
Mr. Wirtz?

19:06.410 --> 19:07.600
Mr. Wirtz!

19:07.610 --> 19:11.410
His pressure just shot up over 190.

19:11.420 --> 19:13.510
He's not breathing and
his pupils are blown.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
Call neurosurgery.

19:14.530 --> 19:17.440
I need to intubate.

19:17.450 --> 19:20.490
He just got a head CT. Look.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.520
That's a Mount Fuji sign.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.610
Air building up in his skull,

19:22.620 --> 19:25.420
which means this is not
mucous coming out of his nose.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.460
It's cerebrospinal fluid from his brain.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.540
He must've fallen a few days ago.

19:29.550 --> 19:30.610
This isn't a sinus infection.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.460
This is an anterior skull fracture.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.460
And if we don't release
the pressure immediately,

19:34.470 --> 19:35.460
he's gonna die.

19:35.470 --> 19:36.600
I'm in. Maggie, get the drill.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.579
- Got you.
- Code blue team to the ED.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.490
Dr. Choi, I need you
to drill a burr hole.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.610
Can't. Gunshot just came in.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.580
- But this man's got about...
- You've seen it done.

19:43.590 --> 19:45.600
Do it.

19:52.540 --> 19:53.620
- Who's gonna do this?
- I am.

19:53.630 --> 19:55.490
But you're a med student.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.610
You can't drill a
hole into a man's head.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.420
- Somebody has to.
- [sighs]

20:01.520 --> 20:02.629
Here.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.589
We're both gonna catch hell for this.

20:04.590 --> 20:06.570
[sighs] Yeah.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.570
[drill whirring]

20:18.994 --> 20:20.093
[drill whirring]

20:20.094 --> 20:21.164
Are you sure you're in the right spot?

20:21.174 --> 20:23.044
Three centimeters from the midline.

20:23.054 --> 20:25.054
Should be right above the pocket of air.

20:25.064 --> 20:26.054
"Should be"?

20:26.064 --> 20:28.154
[drill whirring]

20:28.164 --> 20:32.013
I'm through.

20:32.014 --> 20:35.024
BP back down 130 over 74.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.063
[laughs]

20:41.064 --> 20:43.134
Damn, Reese, you did it.

20:43.144 --> 20:45.183
Uh-huh.

20:45.184 --> 20:47.144
See what's taking neuro
so long to get down here.

20:47.154 --> 20:49.094
Got you.

20:51.184 --> 20:54.023
So I'm thinking our
best approach would be

20:54.024 --> 20:58.143
a course of both medication...
a serotonin reuptake inhibitor...

20:58.144 --> 21:00.023
and psychotherapy.

21:00.024 --> 21:01.054
It's not gonna work.

21:01.064 --> 21:04.044
How do you know until we've tried?

21:04.054 --> 21:06.064
You see that guy out there?

21:06.074 --> 21:09.014
They gave him
something called a nerve block.

21:09.024 --> 21:10.103
What, exactly, is that?

21:10.104 --> 21:13.044
It's a regional
anesthetic injected near a nerve

21:13.054 --> 21:15.054
to block a specific site.

21:15.064 --> 21:16.983
Maybe that could work for me?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.073
You know, so I
wouldn't be so aware of the arm.

21:19.074 --> 21:21.094
Well, it wouldn't be a permanent fix.

21:21.104 --> 21:23.064
I would do anything to
make this feeling go away,

21:23.074 --> 21:24.073
even for a minute.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.144
Right.

21:25.154 --> 21:27.073
I understand, I understand.

21:27.074 --> 21:30.054
And I would try the
meds and the psychotherapy

21:30.064 --> 21:31.094
along with it.

21:31.104 --> 21:32.953
I would need your assurance

21:32.954 --> 21:34.984
that you'd both stick with your therapy

21:34.994 --> 21:37.114
and that you wouldn't harm yourself.

21:37.124 --> 21:38.953
I promise.

21:38.954 --> 21:42.024
Look, why don't I
consult an anesthesiologist

21:42.034 --> 21:46.064
and, um... and we'll go from there.

21:46.074 --> 21:49.153
Dr. Charles?

21:49.154 --> 21:52.174
Do you think someone could
get me out of these restraints?

21:52.184 --> 21:54.034
All in due time.

21:54.044 --> 21:56.113
For now, frankly, I'm just,
uh... I'm really encouraged

21:56.114 --> 21:59.074
that we've come up with a plan.

22:13.257 --> 22:14.964
Ms. Patrick's still hooked
up to the ventilator.

22:14.974 --> 22:16.963
Her husband agree to organ donation?

22:16.964 --> 22:18.963
Not yet.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.994
He said anything?

22:21.004 --> 22:24.963
Just sits there.

22:24.964 --> 22:27.163
[phone vibrating]

22:27.164 --> 22:30.963
Hey, Father. No, no, she
hasn't decided yet.

22:30.964 --> 22:34.004
As soon as she does, I'll...
I'll call you, okay?

22:34.014 --> 22:37.963
All right, thanks.

22:37.964 --> 22:39.954
Helping Natalie with the baptism.

22:39.964 --> 22:41.144
Uh-huh.

22:41.154 --> 22:43.133
She wants you to do that?

22:43.134 --> 22:45.154
Course. Why wouldn't she?

22:47.164 --> 22:50.093
What?

22:50.094 --> 22:52.034
You want my opinion?

22:52.044 --> 22:55.074
Sounds like I'm going to get it.

22:55.084 --> 22:57.144
You need to give that woman some space.

23:16.014 --> 23:19.044
Did you drill the burr
hole in the patient's head?

23:19.054 --> 23:20.133
I did.

23:20.134 --> 23:22.974
Ms. Reese, you're not a doctor.

23:22.984 --> 23:26.064
You're a student
granted access to this hospital,

23:26.074 --> 23:28.054
strictly for learning purposes,

23:28.064 --> 23:30.103
which means you are not licensed

23:30.104 --> 23:34.134
to perform an
invasive procedure on a patient

23:34.144 --> 23:37.103
without direct
supervision by an actual physician.

23:37.104 --> 23:40.023
It is, in fact, illegal.

23:40.024 --> 23:43.144
- I understand.
- I gave the order.

23:43.154 --> 23:44.984
Excuse me?

23:44.994 --> 23:47.024
I was confident she was capable
of this procedure.

23:47.034 --> 23:50.084
I'd warn you to be very
careful what you say.

23:52.984 --> 23:54.134
I've had extensive clinical experience

23:54.144 --> 23:55.183
with student doctor Reese.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.174
I have full faith in her abilities.

23:58.184 --> 24:01.044
If you disagree with this
patient's treatment,

24:01.054 --> 24:04.054
your disagreement is with me.

24:09.984 --> 24:11.993
[sighs]

24:11.994 --> 24:15.004
Don't either of you ever put
me in this position again.

24:21.074 --> 24:23.134
You did not have to do that.

24:23.144 --> 24:25.184
It's the truth, Reese.

24:25.954 --> 24:27.174
And you're family.

24:27.184 --> 24:30.094
We rise or fall together.

24:35.104 --> 24:37.113
Some help here! I need some help!

24:37.114 --> 24:38.953
Daddy, Daddy!

24:38.954 --> 24:39.993
He threw up blood.

24:39.994 --> 24:41.113
Call the OR. We're taking him up now.

24:41.114 --> 24:42.154
Okay.

24:42.164 --> 24:44.114
It's like you said, right? The bleeding.

24:44.124 --> 24:45.943
We should have operated.

24:45.954 --> 24:48.954
Wait here. We'll keep you updated.

24:54.124 --> 24:55.963
It's my fault.

24:55.964 --> 24:58.954
This is... this is my fault.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.203
Looking for magnets in the intestine
is a little bit like

25:06.204 --> 25:09.194
looking for a piece of
gum in a garden hose.

25:09.204 --> 25:10.284
How's the bowel look?

25:10.294 --> 25:13.163
Obstructed, but no gross ischemia.

25:13.164 --> 25:16.203
Looks like we got here in time.

25:16.204 --> 25:17.284
All right. Found 'em.

25:17.294 --> 25:20.284
One's in the stomach, the
other small intestine.

25:20.294 --> 25:22.194
Let's get him out of
here while the bowel

25:22.204 --> 25:25.194
still has some life in it.

25:26.294 --> 25:28.093
Damn.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.214
What is it?

25:29.224 --> 25:31.213
The magnets must have eroded
through an artery.

25:31.214 --> 25:33.173
- Get in here.
- What?

25:33.174 --> 25:34.253
I need an extra set of hands now.

25:34.254 --> 25:36.173
I haven't done that
since medical school.

25:36.174 --> 25:38.124
- Call a surgical resident.
- There's no time.

25:38.134 --> 25:41.124
Get in here.

25:43.254 --> 25:44.253
Here.

25:44.254 --> 25:48.154
Hold this back.

25:48.164 --> 25:51.164
There. Right there.

25:52.254 --> 25:54.294
I'm getting a ton of
blood from the NG tube.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.294
I got to give him a unit.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.213
He's a kid. Not yet.

25:57.214 --> 25:58.284
I keep slipping.

25:58.294 --> 26:00.174
Can you get it?

26:00.184 --> 26:01.213
No, I lost it.

26:01.214 --> 26:03.093
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:03.094 --> 26:05.253
Hold still.

26:05.254 --> 26:07.103
There.

26:07.104 --> 26:08.304
Pinch down.

26:09.074 --> 26:10.174
Right there.

26:10.184 --> 26:12.103
- Got it.
- Good.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.006
- Clamps.
- Clamp.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.183
I don't see the vessel.

26:15.184 --> 26:17.899
It's buried in the
fat, but you've got it.

26:18.074 --> 26:20.284
Trust me.

26:20.294 --> 26:23.143
All right.

26:23.144 --> 26:26.154
Now let go.

26:27.224 --> 26:29.164
BP's stable.

26:29.174 --> 26:30.214
Good.

26:30.224 --> 26:32.103
Let's tie these off, close up the holes,

26:32.104 --> 26:33.303
and get him on his way.

26:33.304 --> 26:36.094
Thank you, Dr. Manning.

26:40.104 --> 26:41.294
Eric did fine.

26:41.304 --> 26:43.144
He's gonna be okay.

26:43.154 --> 26:45.104
Thank you. Thank you.

26:45.114 --> 26:47.183
Dr. Rhodes will come
soon and talk to you.

26:47.184 --> 26:49.153
- Can I see my son?
- Yes.

26:49.154 --> 26:52.164
In a little while.

26:54.204 --> 26:57.073
Eric will be in the
hospital for four to five days,

26:57.074 --> 27:00.094
maybe a week.

27:00.104 --> 27:02.174
So I guess I'll be seeing you.

27:02.184 --> 27:05.174
Yeah.

27:07.114 --> 27:08.273
Got to get back to work.

27:08.274 --> 27:10.094
Sure.

27:16.114 --> 27:18.144
He's a young kid, he's healthy.

27:18.154 --> 27:20.264
He will heal fast.

27:20.274 --> 27:23.074
Now be honest, you kind of liked using

27:23.084 --> 27:24.174
the giant intestine stapler.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.073
[laughs]

27:26.074 --> 27:30.134
I kind of liked using the
giant intestine stapler.

27:30.144 --> 27:32.203
- Everybody does.
- [giggles]

27:32.204 --> 27:34.224
Hey, I'm sorry for earlier.

27:34.234 --> 27:36.163
- When I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

27:36.164 --> 27:39.123
I just... I felt for that dad.

27:39.124 --> 27:42.084
Single parent, having to
make that decision by himself.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.104
I imagine it can't be easy.

27:44.114 --> 27:46.123
I have a decision of my own to make.

27:46.124 --> 27:50.304
Nothing so momentous, but
I'm having a tough time.

27:51.074 --> 27:53.164
My mother-in-law is
insisting I get Owen baptized.

27:53.174 --> 27:55.243
Oh, family drama. Now you're
in my wheelhouse.

27:55.244 --> 27:57.084
Yeah. Family and religion.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.123
You know, religion
was actually the one topic

27:59.124 --> 28:00.203
we managed to avoid.

28:00.204 --> 28:02.083
Dad never saw the upside to it.

28:02.084 --> 28:04.154
- You're lucky.
- I don't know.

28:04.164 --> 28:06.163
I always kind of envied the
kids who went to church.

28:06.164 --> 28:08.243
You know, they were a part of something.

28:08.244 --> 28:11.134
It's like they had their own tribe.

28:15.104 --> 28:17.294
Mr. Tacker.

28:17.304 --> 28:20.244
I see you've had your nerve block.

28:20.254 --> 28:22.253
Should be starting to feel it by now.

28:22.254 --> 28:24.293
I feel so much better.

28:24.294 --> 28:26.204
How long will it last?

28:26.214 --> 28:27.213
Oh, several hours.

28:27.214 --> 28:29.133
But we could always re-administer

28:29.134 --> 28:31.093
for longer periods.

28:31.094 --> 28:34.094
I wanted to use the nerve
block in conjunction with

28:34.104 --> 28:36.253
another approach that
I've been looking into.

28:36.254 --> 28:40.093
It's called "pretend therapy."

28:40.094 --> 28:41.244
Pretend?

28:41.254 --> 28:45.133
The idea is that you
function as if the limb weren't there.

28:45.134 --> 28:46.213
You pretend.

28:46.214 --> 28:49.093
See what it's like to go
through life without it.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.293
It's cognitive work.

28:51.294 --> 28:54.264
Sorry, I'm so tired.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.144
You know what?

28:56.154 --> 28:58.303
The anesthesiologist administered
a mild sedative

28:58.304 --> 29:01.103
before giving you the block.

29:01.104 --> 29:03.348
Why don't I check
back with you in a bit,

29:03.349 --> 29:06.134
and we'll get started?

29:06.144 --> 29:08.051
Could you pull my covers up?

29:08.052 --> 29:10.094
I'm just a little cold.

29:12.234 --> 29:14.223
Dr. Charles.

29:14.224 --> 29:16.204
Thank you.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.284
For everything.

29:17.294 --> 29:20.284
Come on. We're a team.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.094
[sighs]

29:32.104 --> 29:35.294
Hope you're not planning on jumping.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.304
No.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.214
Everything is mixed up.

29:43.224 --> 29:46.184
I saved a life.

29:46.194 --> 29:49.104
And that was good, really good.

29:49.114 --> 29:51.274
And then I got in
trouble, and that was bad.

29:51.284 --> 29:55.234
And then Dr. Choi stuck up for me.

29:55.244 --> 29:57.153
Called me family.

29:57.154 --> 30:00.154
That sounds good, too.

30:01.154 --> 30:03.114
It was.

30:03.124 --> 30:04.274
So...

30:04.284 --> 30:07.264
why are you out here?

30:07.274 --> 30:09.153
[laughs]

30:09.154 --> 30:14.094
'Cause it's Match Day, and
everything's mixed up!

30:14.104 --> 30:17.274
It'll all be clear very soon.

30:17.284 --> 30:20.154
Yeah.

31:13.254 --> 31:17.074
Mrs. Baker is too
sick to continue the trial.

31:17.084 --> 31:20.294
She's going home.

31:20.304 --> 31:23.173
She's finally getting her wish.

31:23.174 --> 31:26.184
Yes.

31:34.224 --> 31:37.253
Dr. Halstead.

31:37.254 --> 31:39.253
Dr. Halstead.

31:39.254 --> 31:43.174
Guy in three dislocated his shoulder.

31:43.184 --> 31:44.244
Go.

31:44.254 --> 31:46.214
Pop it back in.

31:46.224 --> 31:48.294
Okay.

31:52.094 --> 31:55.094
[screaming]

31:57.134 --> 31:58.264
Blood pressure spiked.

31:58.274 --> 31:59.284
Mr. Tacker?

31:59.294 --> 32:01.134
I'm sorry!

32:01.144 --> 32:03.174
[groaning]

32:03.184 --> 32:05.134
He slipped his restraint!

32:05.144 --> 32:06.263
He made a tourniquet out of tubing.

32:06.264 --> 32:08.264
- Half milligram dilaudid.
- Yes, Dr. Charles.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.303
No, no, no, don't touch it!

32:09.304 --> 32:10.303
The arm's dead.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.214
You dump potassium into the bloodstream,

32:12.224 --> 32:14.104
he'd go into cardiovascular collapse.

32:14.114 --> 32:15.224
We have to amputate his arm.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.224
Let's go!

32:16.234 --> 32:19.143
I'm sorry. I had to!

32:19.144 --> 32:22.144
[screaming]

32:33.414 --> 32:35.394
Yes! Yes!

32:37.314 --> 32:40.214
Here you go.

32:47.404 --> 32:49.264
Mayo, baby! [laughs]

32:49.274 --> 32:51.384
Yes! [laughs]

32:56.264 --> 32:58.274
Reese, Sarah.

33:19.244 --> 33:22.254
I haven't got room for them!

33:23.394 --> 33:27.344
Yes, this is your problem, Roger.

33:27.354 --> 33:28.324
Get them out of here!

33:28.334 --> 33:30.234
This is a lot of bedpans.

33:30.244 --> 33:32.403
Are we expecting a listeria outbreak?

33:32.404 --> 33:36.243
Some idiot in supply added
a zero to my order.

33:36.244 --> 33:40.243
- So instead of four dozen...
- You got 40 dozen?

33:40.244 --> 33:41.354
Uh-huh.

33:41.364 --> 33:44.204
[laughs]

33:44.214 --> 33:48.314
[both laughing]

33:48.324 --> 33:49.404
See? You can't retire.

33:49.414 --> 33:51.204
How could you give all this up?

33:51.214 --> 33:52.374
Yeah, how could I?

33:52.384 --> 33:55.254
It's so much better than the Maldives.

33:55.264 --> 33:56.334
[both laughing]

34:01.414 --> 34:03.204
Well?

34:08.414 --> 34:11.373
[laughs]

34:11.373 --> 34:13.214
You got it!

34:13.224 --> 34:16.204
Chicago Med, pathology.

34:16.214 --> 34:17.373
This calls for celebration.

34:17.384 --> 34:19.373
Yeah.

34:19.373 --> 34:21.393
I'll get my coat, and um, check Groupon,

34:21.404 --> 34:24.404
and see where I can get a deal.

34:26.424 --> 34:28.424
Congratulations.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.384
Reese. You get your match?

34:54.393 --> 34:55.384
Uh-huh. Pathology.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.422
Congrats!

34:56.424 --> 34:58.304
That's what you wanted, right?

34:58.314 --> 34:59.414
Yeah.

34:59.424 --> 35:02.424
Yeah, um, but this was
starting to feel sort of like home.

35:04.424 --> 35:06.354
Yeah.

35:06.364 --> 35:09.284
We'll miss you.

35:37.264 --> 35:39.354
He played us.

35:39.364 --> 35:42.424
You mean me.

35:43.194 --> 35:46.344
Look, nobody likes getting snookered.

35:46.354 --> 35:49.204
But that's not what's bothering me.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.364
It's why I fell for it.

35:51.374 --> 35:53.274
He's a good liar.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.264
Not really.

35:55.274 --> 35:59.354
I didn't see the
depth of his desperation.

35:59.364 --> 36:01.403
You know, didn't want to.

36:01.404 --> 36:04.283
So I just pulled out
my standard playbook...

36:04.284 --> 36:06.354
meds, psychotherapy.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.194
What else could you have done?

36:08.204 --> 36:09.324
I could have gone up to ortho.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.274
Looked for somebody to take his arm off.

36:11.284 --> 36:14.404
Dr. Charles, we can't intentionally
maim a patient.

36:14.414 --> 36:16.283
Of course not.

36:16.284 --> 36:19.244
All I'm saying...

36:19.254 --> 36:23.364
in cases like this, are
the decisions we're making

36:23.374 --> 36:26.364
really in the patient's best
interest, or are they in ours?

36:26.374 --> 36:29.284
To make us feel better?

36:29.294 --> 36:32.404
'Cause like it or
not, that's a happy ending.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.413
Mr. Patrick...

36:54.414 --> 36:57.253
You didn't know her.

36:57.254 --> 37:00.254
I knew her.

37:03.254 --> 37:04.274
[knocking]

37:04.284 --> 37:06.334
Come in.

37:06.344 --> 37:09.244
- You paged?
- Uh, yes.

37:09.254 --> 37:11.234
Mr. Patrick wants to go forward

37:11.244 --> 37:13.284
with the egg harvesting protocol.

37:13.294 --> 37:14.334
I don't understand.

37:14.344 --> 37:17.324
Despite the IUD, he says
his wife would want this.

37:17.334 --> 37:20.244
Hospital council says we have no choice.

37:20.254 --> 37:22.414
We have to restart Ms.
Patrick on the protocol.

37:22.424 --> 37:24.343
It's not right.

37:24.344 --> 37:26.384
That woman's body is telling us no.

37:26.394 --> 37:28.284
- Loud and clear.
- Yes.

37:28.294 --> 37:29.384
I agree.

37:29.394 --> 37:31.383
So why won't he listen?

37:31.384 --> 37:33.294
Well, Dr. Halstead,

37:33.304 --> 37:39.214
sometimes we want to
believe something so badly,

37:39.224 --> 37:42.214
we ignore the reality in front of us.

37:43.274 --> 37:47.423
You're familiar with that, aren't you?

37:47.424 --> 37:50.314
Yeah.

37:54.304 --> 37:56.353
Hey.

37:56.354 --> 37:58.353
Hey.

37:58.354 --> 38:01.254
So...

38:01.264 --> 38:05.264
I-I appreciate all the
trouble you've gone to.

38:05.274 --> 38:07.344
The church, the priest.

38:07.354 --> 38:11.314
And I want to get Owen baptized, just...

38:11.324 --> 38:13.314
Just not like that.

38:13.324 --> 38:14.353
Like that?

38:14.354 --> 38:17.193
I want Owen to be a part of a community.

38:17.194 --> 38:20.294
I just want it to be
one that I'm a part of.

38:20.304 --> 38:22.273
So I'm gonna do it my own way.

38:22.274 --> 38:24.314
I know Helen's gonna be upset,

38:24.324 --> 38:26.344
but I hope you won't be.

38:26.354 --> 38:29.304
No.

38:29.314 --> 38:32.354
Natalie... it's your life.

38:32.364 --> 38:35.384
And I want whatever's best for you.

38:40.204 --> 38:42.344
I need to move on.

38:42.354 --> 38:45.314
So, as Father Brady would say,

38:45.324 --> 38:48.314
"Go in peace."

38:57.244 --> 38:58.384
[sighs]

39:23.214 --> 39:25.424
Can you just watch her for a minute?

39:43.384 --> 39:47.333
Thank you.

39:47.334 --> 39:50.324
Thank you for not giving up on Jen.

39:57.224 --> 39:59.244
[crying]

40:10.344 --> 40:12.384
We're here today to
celebrate the newest member

40:12.394 --> 40:14.223
of our community.

40:14.224 --> 40:16.244
And as we do at weddings and funerals,

40:16.254 --> 40:18.343
to offer our love and support.

40:18.344 --> 40:21.324
It is the people in our
lives who bring us joy.

40:21.334 --> 40:23.303
They are the color of our lives.

40:23.304 --> 40:25.334
The beauty and the grace.

40:25.344 --> 40:27.303
I can see by this gathering today,

40:27.304 --> 40:29.414
you will not walk through life alone.

40:29.424 --> 40:31.223
And so, little man,

40:31.224 --> 40:32.404
I wish you Godspeed.

40:32.414 --> 40:34.344
In front of all these gathered
on your behalf,

40:34.354 --> 40:39.223
I baptize you, Owen Jeffrey Manning.

40:39.224 --> 40:42.234
[applause]

41:00.224 --> 41:02.394
I thought he was gonna hit me.

41:02.404 --> 41:05.304
But he thanked me.

41:05.314 --> 41:07.264
Must've been a relief.

41:07.274 --> 41:10.224
Jay, she was on a placebo.

41:11.234 --> 41:13.244
They never knew.

41:17.274 --> 41:21.193
It was all for nothing.

41:21.194 --> 41:24.243
No, you cared.

41:24.244 --> 41:28.323
I think, if we care, then...

41:28.324 --> 41:32.204
whatever happens, it's for something.

41:32.214 --> 41:36.354
We might not see the effect, but...

41:36.364 --> 41:40.403
It goes out there and
it circulates around.

41:40.404 --> 41:43.284
It makes us all better, you know?

41:52.194 --> 41:55.323
My brother, cop and philosopher.

41:55.324 --> 41:57.234
You've got to think big picture.

41:57.244 --> 41:59.314
[chuckles]
