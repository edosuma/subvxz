00:00.534 --> 00:02.203
[music playing]

00:08.109 --> 00:10.644
Another two weeks?

00:10.678 --> 00:11.845
But Dan, I want you home.

00:11.879 --> 00:15.249
We've never been
apart on Thanksgiving.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.251
I miss you.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.754
No, I'm not going to cry.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.391
So how is your mom?

00:23.424 --> 00:25.726
Good.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.296
Well, you've missed a
lot of stuff around here.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.864
Darlene's oldest daughter
won the spelling bee.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.034
And DJ just got out of
the joint yesterday,

00:34.068 --> 00:36.137
served three of the five.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.605
And did I tell you,
I want you home.

00:40.308 --> 00:43.344
God Dan, without you here just--

00:43.377 --> 00:44.412
things just aren't the same.

00:49.283 --> 00:53.221
THEME SONG: Well, what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

00:53.254 --> 00:58.692
we're gonna last longer than
the greatest wall in China

00:58.726 --> 01:01.662
or that rabbit with a drum.

01:01.695 --> 01:06.867
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

01:06.900 --> 01:11.105
for my turn is that in
each life some rain falls,

01:11.139 --> 01:14.074
but you also get some sun.

01:14.108 --> 01:22.483
And we'll make out better
than OK, hey hear what I say,

01:22.516 --> 01:23.917
yeah any day.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.327
[laughing]

01:36.897 --> 01:39.700
This new toaster
blows my mind.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.970
I mean, every morning I've
selected a different shade,

01:43.003 --> 01:44.605
you know.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.574
And it has yet to disappoint.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.080
Plus, you know, the toast
doesn't just pop up.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.717
It gently ascends.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.986
Man, I hope that
dullness gene is recessive.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.258
Good morning.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.760
Happy turkey day, Mrs. Connor
You want a cup of coffee?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.896
Yeah.

02:08.929 --> 02:14.335
Hey, where is my, "my other
mug is a shot glass" mug?

02:14.368 --> 02:17.104
I put the coffee mugs here
above the coffee machine.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.241
It just makes more sense.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.810
I'll move them back now.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.045
Hi everybody.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.716
Darlene, how you doing?

02:28.749 --> 02:30.918
Well, I've had morning
sickness, evening sickness,

02:30.951 --> 02:32.586
roll down the window when
you're driving sickness.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.222
My shoes don't fit,
my rings don't fit,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.723
my clothes don't fit.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.857
My vision is blurry.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.226
And if you want to sit
a spell, I'll tell you

02:38.259 --> 02:39.327
about my brand new hemorrhoids.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.165
Takes about 10 minutes.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.268
Yeah, well.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.204
I still cannot get
over this place.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.606
It's so bright and shiny.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.208
Clean.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.076
Clean, that's what it is.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.446
It's clean.
That's what it is.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.780
Cooking would ruin it.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.849
Hey, hey, hey, have you
checked out my new cupboards,

03:01.882 --> 03:02.783
though?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.718
Really wood, not
the peel off kind.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.621
Well, do you have any
idea what these babies

03:07.655 --> 03:09.923
go for on "The Price is Right?

03:09.957 --> 03:12.926
You are living large.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.128
And it only gets
larger, Jackie.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.298
Listen.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.132
I don't hear a thing.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.569
Exactly.

03:21.602 --> 03:25.773
Whisper quiet, because this new
dishwasher is top of the line.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.007
Oh.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.512
Yes, sirree, the Connor
family has entered the 1970s.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.414
Hello.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.816
(GASPING)

03:35.849 --> 03:37.651
Caterers, I love you.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.187
And it's real this time,
not like that fleeting love

03:40.220 --> 03:43.757
I had for the
pizza delivery boy.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.260
Now I need to know where
you keep your silverware.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.194
Oh yeah, sure.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.401
Where'd you move my spoons?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.936
I thought a closer
proximity to--

03:55.969 --> 03:56.770
my mistake.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.746
So is there anything
at all that we can do?

04:05.779 --> 04:06.814
Nothing, excuse me.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.516
Sure.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.384
Sorry.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.052
You know, I usually I--

04:12.085 --> 04:13.887
I-- you know, I'd
be a lot more help.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.722
Working.

04:18.659 --> 04:23.297
Dear, why don't you do
nothing in the living room.

04:23.331 --> 04:27.301
Well, so hey, let's
watch the Macy's parade.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.369
Yeah.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.404
You know, I've never
actually seen that.

04:30.438 --> 04:33.807
I could use a nap.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.644
Isn't this couch awesome?

04:36.677 --> 04:42.149
It's green and slanty,
what's not to like?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.985
Yeah, and that TV just
makes the room, doesn't it?

04:45.018 --> 04:47.755
Watching insects do it
on the Discovery Channel

04:47.788 --> 04:51.392
now is going to
be really creepy.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.060
You don't think
it's too big, do you?

04:53.093 --> 04:56.997
I mean, everything is
kind of working, right?

04:57.030 --> 04:57.898
Yeah, absolutely.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.099
It works.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.436
It just it takes a little
bit of getting used to.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.237
Yeah.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.906
Yeah, you're right.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.241
[screaming]

05:08.275 --> 05:10.143
It's OK.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.045
It's OK.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.280
It's OK.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.448
It's only Al Roker.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.891
You know, it's no wonder
men fall asleep on holidays.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.293
It is exhausting
watching people cook.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.198
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.770
I would have been here
sooner, but homeless people

05:36.804 --> 05:38.472
were lined up
around the shelter,

05:38.506 --> 05:40.641
and they caused a
horrible traffic jam.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.443
It's so inconvenient.

05:42.476 --> 05:46.013
They should close on holidays.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.615
Mother, I'm so proud of you.

05:47.648 --> 05:52.219
You've learn to say "homeless
people" instead of "bums."

05:52.252 --> 05:53.120
What's that?

05:53.153 --> 05:55.288
It's a jello mold with kiwis.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.726
Mother, we have
caterers this year.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.428
Everything is done.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.130
Did they bring a jello mold?

06:03.163 --> 06:05.499
No, they did not.

06:05.533 --> 06:11.171
Well then I suppose someone
should say, thank you, Mother.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.473
Go ahead, Jimmy.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.373
Thank you, mother.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.647
[cheering]

06:19.680 --> 06:21.615
Oh, gees.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.217
Butter fingers.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.455
Man, there must be
like 10 guys in a pile.

06:27.488 --> 06:31.258
Ten guys in a pile.

06:31.291 --> 06:35.996
New Year's Eve, 1976.

06:36.029 --> 06:41.034
Oh, Columbus day, 1938.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.136
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, there's

06:43.170 --> 06:45.072
no eating in the living room.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.907
Well hey, we
have our shirts on.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.976
Yeah, well that
doesn't matter,

06:49.009 --> 06:51.411
because I've seen
pictures of fancy living

06:51.445 --> 06:52.780
rooms in magazines.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.115
Now they either have food
in them our people in them,

06:55.148 --> 06:58.285
but they never have both.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.254
God.

07:01.288 --> 07:05.225
A little "Architectural
Digest" is a dangerous thing.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.194
[doorbell ringing]

07:07.227 --> 07:09.997
Just, can anybody
hear the doorbell?

07:10.030 --> 07:10.898
Yes, thank you.

07:10.931 --> 07:11.732
Yeah, we heard it.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.705
Jackie, happy Thanksgiving.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.440
Carlos, it's a pleasure
to see you again.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.142
And you.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.176
Everyone rise.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.282
May I present to
you, Prince Carlos

07:29.316 --> 07:34.287
Philip Jonathan Kent Arthur
William Hobson Pepe Charmaine.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.191
Hello everyone.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.860
Your Highness, I
just want you to know

07:39.893 --> 07:41.361
we have that picture
of you and Leon

07:41.394 --> 07:43.230
dancing together
right up on our mantle

07:43.263 --> 07:44.632
next to our wedding picture.

07:44.665 --> 07:49.703
Yeah, it's lit by a baby
spot in a soft pink filter.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.971
Well, thank you.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.106
Look at that, that guy
split his pants down the back.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.007
No.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.442
Well, don't go to commercial.

07:59.613 --> 08:03.416
Oh my, is that how
you drink in Moldavia?

08:03.450 --> 08:05.452
Yes, but don't feel you
have to keep up with me.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.093
I'll get us a
couple more glasses,

08:13.126 --> 08:15.896
and then we'll see who keeps up
with whom, you naughty prince.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.769
You scare him off,
I'll break your good hip.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.774
Roseanne, what are
you doing in here?

08:26.807 --> 08:29.409
I'm helping.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.680
Oh god, those smell great.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.916
They're yams etouffee.

08:35.949 --> 08:36.817
Yams?

08:36.850 --> 08:39.452
Where's the marshmallows?

08:39.486 --> 08:42.856
At a Girl Scout picnic
where they belong.

08:42.890 --> 08:46.226
Putting marshmallows on
the yams is the fun part.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.161
Listen, if you want
marshmallows on your yams,

08:48.195 --> 08:49.062
let me do it.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.197
Now all right.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.331
Roseanne, you're
paying these guys

08:51.364 --> 08:52.432
a lot of money to do the job.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.401
So let--now come on, come on.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.169
No, I have nothing
to do out there.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.806
Well, you have nothing
to do in here either.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.707
All right, fine.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.742
I'll be out there in a minute.

09:01.775 --> 09:10.918
59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54.

09:10.951 --> 09:11.819
Here's how.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.292
Back in a jiffy.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.562
Hey Prince, did your father
ever fix that leaky roof

09:22.596 --> 09:23.931
on the East Wing of the palace?

09:23.964 --> 09:24.998
Yes.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.034
But how on earth did
you know about that?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.402
Well, I boinked your
father a couple of times.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.274
To Moldavia.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.376
Three Moldavia.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.912
Mother, are you
harassing the prince?

09:42.315 --> 09:47.721
Must you puncture
every balloon I send up?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.690
Carlos, is she bothering you?

09:49.723 --> 09:52.993
No sirree Bob.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.294
No sirree what?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.730
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.099
I went two years to the
University of Texas.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.335
And every now and again
after a few cocktails

10:02.369 --> 10:04.237
I have sort of a
linguistic flashback.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.138
Oh, I see.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.874
But you're OK now?

10:06.907 --> 10:09.242
You betcha sister, yeehaw.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.547
I mean yes, of course.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.448
She's coming!

10:15.482 --> 10:16.349
She's coming!

10:16.383 --> 10:17.951
Red alert!

10:17.985 --> 10:18.952
oh!

10:18.986 --> 10:20.921
Mayday, mayday,
we're going down.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.923
[baby crying]

10:22.956 --> 10:24.524
Jerry, Jerry, don't cry.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.626
You didn't do it,
the grown-ups did.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.262
Look Jerry, Mr. Napkin is
cleaning up that evil old adult

10:29.296 --> 10:31.598
beverage, zoom, zoom, zoom.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.066
All gone.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.068
You know, you guys are
pretty good with kids.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.105
How does a buck an hour and
all the Fruit Loops you can eat

10:38.138 --> 10:39.172
sound?

10:39.206 --> 10:40.573
Well, we have been
reading up a lot

10:40.607 --> 10:44.144
lately on raising children.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.713
Should I tell them?

10:45.746 --> 10:48.081
Leon, we decided to
wait until we were sure.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.549
Oh, I know, I know.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.918
But I'm just so excited, Scott.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.219
Oh go, go.

10:52.252 --> 10:58.992
Everybody, Scott and I
are going to adopt a baby.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.560
Oh, that is so great.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.461
Thank you.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.130
That really is great.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.033
You know, that "My Two
Dads" was a great show.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.903
Congratulations, you guys.

11:09.937 --> 11:10.871
Thank you, David.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.005
You know, just
for the hell of it,

11:12.039 --> 11:13.140
why don't one of
you have something

11:13.173 --> 11:14.341
ripped from your pelvis anyway.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.952
You're gonna adopt a baby?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.320
Well, we tried to
conceive naturally,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.890
but we just didn't seem
to have any luck at all.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.896
Well, I'm appalled.

11:35.929 --> 11:40.467
The very idea, two gay
men adopting a child.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.668
Mother.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.906
I read somewhere that
this is how they recruit.

11:45.939 --> 11:49.176
They can't have
children of their own,

11:49.209 --> 11:54.214
so they have to adopt
to freshen their ranks.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.583
Hey Ma, what do you say
after dinner me and you

11:56.616 --> 11:59.953
just march right into Austria.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.922
Stay out of their
business, Mother.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.491
Don't you tell me what to do.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.459
Why don't you
just drink up, Bev.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.262
You've got a long drive home.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.998
Wait, wait, just a minute.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.866
I'm watching the game.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.668
I know what I know,
and that is a fact.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.404
I will not be reasoned with.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.306
You don't know squat.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.041
I do know one thing.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.979
Daughters can tear the heart
out of a mother with one word.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.515
Oh, just name the word, Mom.

12:33.053 --> 12:36.456
I have told you that every
holiday at Roseanne's ends up

12:36.489 --> 12:37.524
in insanity.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.193
Well, don't start
or they'll turn on us.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.162
Everyone stop fighting.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.165
I'm not fighting, I'm
saving civilization.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.101
Anarchy, anarchy, anarchy.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.736
Wow, the acoustics
in this new room

12:49.769 --> 12:51.404
just make a fight sound swell.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.311
I don't care!

12:58.345 --> 13:00.613
[arguing continues]

13:00.647 --> 13:02.649
He's my husband, why isn't
he going to take it personally?

13:02.682 --> 13:03.951
I know, I know,
but it's her problem.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.685
It is true.

13:05.718 --> 13:06.786
Look it up.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.357
73% of all children
raised by homosexuals

13:10.390 --> 13:14.094
turn out to be choreographers.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
That's crap, Mom.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.031
That is just like your theory
about half the Supreme Court

13:18.065 --> 13:21.601
being on the Vatican payroll.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.570
See, I told you we should
have kept our mouths shut.

13:23.603 --> 13:27.207
You know, you're binding me.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.276
Whoa-ee.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.113
It's hotter than a
jalapeno in hell in here.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.414
Carlos, what are you doing?

13:34.447 --> 13:35.615
I'm just getting
homey, Sweet Pea.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.850
All right.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.451
Well, what do you say we
red light the wine for now.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.352
OK.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.654
Just let me top off that tank.

13:44.624 --> 13:49.396
Yeah, you know, there's a
lot of negativity and alcohol

13:49.429 --> 13:50.797
in this room.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.633
I think it would be great if we
all just went around the table

13:53.666 --> 13:56.369
and said one thing that
we're really thankful for.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.737
Oh, for god's sake.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.072
What's wrong with you?

13:59.106 --> 14:00.307
Hey, come on, now.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.443
I think David's
dumb idea is great.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.878
Everybody go around
and say something

14:04.912 --> 14:05.946
that you're thankful for.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.380
That's wonderful.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.882
Well, I'm happy we
won all that money.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.118
Ah, not just the money, but
the stuff the money bought us,

14:11.151 --> 14:12.619
you know.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.553
No, no, no.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.122
Not about the money.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.756
You know, something
more meaningful,

14:16.789 --> 14:19.826
something important to you.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.396
I can't, I'm sorry.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.066
You're married to
my daughter, Mark.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.634
Dear Lord, thank
you for Miss Connor's

14:27.667 --> 14:28.735
daughter, the blonde one.

14:28.768 --> 14:31.671
Thanks again.

14:31.704 --> 14:36.876
Yeah, I'm thankful for all
this delicious food and the

14:36.910 --> 14:40.647
cute guys who are serving it.

14:40.680 --> 14:45.818
Well, I'm thankful that my
life experience has allowed

14:45.852 --> 14:48.655
me to remain open minded.

14:48.688 --> 14:52.292
Stop making a ball
out of your bread.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.861
Well, I would like
to give thanks that I

14:54.894 --> 14:59.666
am a not a young child being
raised by two very tasteful

14:59.699 --> 15:02.302
but none the less
light in the loafers.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.303
Hey, Mom!

15:03.336 --> 15:04.304
Mom!

15:04.337 --> 15:05.805
Look around you.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.475
Nobody's talking
about that anymore.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.778
I just don't think two
man should raise a child.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.214
I married a man.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.184
He was cruel to my
children and cheated on me.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.486
He had horrible table manners.

15:19.519 --> 15:25.058
And he made me drive an old car
with bald tires, the bastard.

15:25.092 --> 15:30.097
Mother, try to save a little
something for Christmas.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.499
And he's not the
only man like that.

15:32.532 --> 15:36.436
They are all cut from the same
cloth, which is why I don't

15:36.469 --> 15:38.805
particularly care for men.

15:38.838 --> 15:42.775
Frankly, to sleep with a man is
to know how much you hate them.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.545
By the end of my
marriage, the only way

15:45.578 --> 15:49.216
I could have sex with my husband
was if I stomped off the store

15:49.249 --> 15:50.750
and bought myself
a Playboy first.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.131
Well, I think Grandma's
just outed herself.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.603
Oh, god.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.905
I've always known it
since she's a little girl.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.842
She always liked flannel.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.045
Have you acted on this?

16:18.078 --> 16:19.746
With who, when, how?

16:19.779 --> 16:21.248
No, don't tell me.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.082
Pass the yams.

16:25.885 --> 16:29.789
Amongst us royalty,
most everybody is gay.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.824
We just marry so
folks won't hang us.

16:35.795 --> 16:40.133
You know what just
really fries me?

16:40.167 --> 16:43.203
Our whole lives, you
make me and Jackie

16:43.236 --> 16:45.905
dress up like little
baby dolls, you know.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.774
You paint our fingernails.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.209
You tell us always
to cross our legs

16:49.242 --> 16:51.044
and act like little ladies.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.679
You're like, don't
ever act too smart,

16:52.712 --> 16:54.947
because you may not get a man.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.583
And now you are
sitting there, my

16:56.616 --> 16:59.619
right wing conservative
Republican mother

16:59.652 --> 17:01.020
is a great big old lesbo.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.026
Welcome to the club, Bev.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.932
We'll teach you
the secret handshake.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.320
You hate it all, don't you.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.155
No, I don't hate it.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.824
Just kind of like I miss
some stuff, you know.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.626
Like the couch and
that spot on the rug

17:39.659 --> 17:42.195
that used to look
like Mr. French.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.831
Well, I'm kind of
embarrassed to tell you this,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.499
but uh, I didn't
give all our stuff

17:46.533 --> 17:48.168
to charity like you asked.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.136
I saved some stuff.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.503
Yeah?
No kidding?

17:50.537 --> 17:51.738
Like what?

17:51.771 --> 17:54.674
Like that picture of
the dogs playing poker.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.009
And that lamp that DJ hit
his head on, you know,

17:57.043 --> 17:58.978
after I threw it at him.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.180
And there's one other thing.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.885
Oh man, the afghan.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.120
Hey, that looks different.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.222
You didn't wash it, did you?

18:09.256 --> 18:12.292
God, no.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.193
Hmm, yeah.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.198
I don't know, This
just didn't feel like

18:18.231 --> 18:22.001
a regular Thanksgiving, did it?

18:22.034 --> 18:23.836
Well, it did have
its weird moments.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.472
What with Grandma
saying she was gay

18:25.505 --> 18:28.441
and the Prince
going Ozark on us.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.344
No, that part felt like
the regular Thanksgiving.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.246
It's just, I mean,
like I'm not tired.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.281
My back doesn't hurt.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.283
I don't have any
burns on my hands.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.617
Well, have another
piece of pie.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.585
Maybe you'll get indigestion.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.253
Gesture

18:40.287 --> 18:42.088
It's just the weirdest
thing, you know.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.423
Because when you're
poor you hear

18:43.456 --> 18:46.393
people say stuff like money
doesn't buy happiness.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.894
And right away you
think, oh yeah,

18:47.927 --> 18:50.963
you're just not shopping
in the right place, idiot.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.099
And then we win this
big lottery, you know.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.003
We go crazy at the
spa and in New York.

18:57.036 --> 19:00.573
Come back home and
your dad's not here.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.742
And it's Thanksgiving, you know.

19:02.775 --> 19:07.146
I haven't done
anything for my family.

19:07.180 --> 19:11.684
I don't know, I just
realized, money is just money.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.985
Psst, you guys, do you know?

19:13.019 --> 19:14.854
Are we supposed to
tip the caterers?

19:14.887 --> 19:16.789
Because I just heard
one of them say

19:16.823 --> 19:19.091
those rich bozos wouldn't
know the holiday spirit

19:19.125 --> 19:22.295
if it bit them in the ass.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.464
Tip the caterers?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.899
Usually our biggest problem
is whether to scrub the pan

19:26.933 --> 19:27.834
or just throw it out.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.806
I just feel like I want
to do something, you know.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.177
I don't want to feel like
this big useless rich jerk.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.979
Come on Mom,
you're not useless.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.882
You bought dinner for all of us.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.384
Yeah, but that's not my style.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.119
I'm not the kind of
person that buys stuff.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.456
I'm the kind of person
that does stuff.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.091
Well, you can buy
stuff and do stuff too.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.264
Yeah.

20:00.900 --> 20:01.801
Here's what we ought to do.

20:06.639 --> 20:10.109
OK, here's a plate and
an extra plate in case

20:10.142 --> 20:13.212
that guy you were
talking to ever shows up.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.685
Here you go.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.619
You know, if you were
down at the mission,

20:19.652 --> 20:20.987
they'd make you
sing a dozen hymns

20:21.020 --> 20:24.090
before they doled out the chow.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.659
Hey, weren't you in line
just a couple of minutes

20:26.693 --> 20:29.529
ago with a different hat?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.298
I admire your style.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.233
Jackie, give this guy an extra
helping on them French yams.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.337
Yes sir, delicious,
buttery yams.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.605
If you want any more, come back.

20:38.638 --> 20:42.842
But do remember they
are high in fat.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.944
Hey mom, this
was a great idea.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.813
Yeah, it really
was, wasn't it?

20:46.846 --> 20:51.884
I mean, I'm feeding people, I'm
exhausted, I busted up a fight,

20:51.918 --> 20:54.253
I burned the hell
out of my finger.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.255
Finally, it feels
like Thanksgiving.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.632
Well Honey, it's
every man's dream, huh?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.934
A great meal, an over
time football game,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.902
and now we get to watch
"The Wizard of Oz."

21:09.936 --> 21:11.838
Perfect, perfect holiday.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.139
Judy.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.374
Oh, Judy.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.008
How about our
Cowardly Lion, here?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.577
I heard he wasn't so cowardly.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.178
Oh, stop it.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.548
I'll tell you something else
I've heard about the Tin Man.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.449
What?

21:22.482 --> 21:23.350
All true.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.784
He was not just tin, steel.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.985
Man of Steel.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.854
You know, there were
rumours that they were gay.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.121
- Hmmpf.
- All of them.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.357
But in those days,
there were rumors

21:30.390 --> 21:32.359
that everyone was gay
except of course ironically

21:32.392 --> 21:35.395
Rock Hudson and Liberace.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.331
Nobody dreamt that Rock
Hudson-- well, they dreamt.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.432
We could dream.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.000
Thank god that I'm
not a lesbian though.

21:41.033 --> 21:41.901
Why is that?

21:41.934 --> 21:44.404
Well, you know,
what do you do?

21:44.437 --> 21:45.304
With woman.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.205
I don't know.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.374
I've always wondered that.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.875
What do you do?

21:48.908 --> 21:51.578
[theme music]
