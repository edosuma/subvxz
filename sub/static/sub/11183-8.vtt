Your friend will spend
20 years in a Cuban prison

00:26.627 --> 00:29.107
and I assure you, it will be hell on earth.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.410
He's on his way back across
the straits to Cuba, isn't he?

00:35.602 --> 00:37.411
I came to take those prisoners,

00:37.471 --> 00:39.417
and I'm gonna take them back with me!

00:39.473 --> 00:41.316
I have executed men for less.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.582
Do you want to die for nothing?

01:59.219 --> 02:01.825
This briefing is from File A56-7W.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.333
Classified: Top Secret.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.735
Subject: Airwolf
A Mach l-plus attack helicopter

02:06.793 --> 02:09.295
with the most advanced weapons
system in the air today.

02:09.363 --> 02:12.071
It has been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

02:12.132 --> 02:13.736
by its test pilot, Stringfellow Hawke.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.780
Hawke has promised to return Airwolf only

02:15.836 --> 02:18.840
if we can find his brother
Sin Jin, an MIA in Vietnam.

02:18.905 --> 02:20.316
We suspect that Archangel,

02:20.374 --> 02:22.854
Deputy Director of the
agency that built Airwolf,

02:22.909 --> 02:25.287
is secretly helping Hawke
in return for Hawke's

02:25.345 --> 02:27.723
flying Airwolf on missions
of national concern.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.694
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

02:30.751 --> 02:32.924
and a recluse since his
brother's disappearance.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.727
His only friend is Dominic Santini,

02:34.788 --> 02:37.268
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.201
With Hawke and Santini flying as a team

02:39.259 --> 02:41.102
at speeds rivaling the fastest jets,

02:41.161 --> 02:42.765
backed by unmatched firepower,

02:42.829 --> 02:45.503
Airwolf is too dangerous to be
left in unenlightened hands.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.567
Finding it is your 1st priority.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.186
It's show and tell time, buddy.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.162
You go first.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.135
Welcome to Cuba.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.301
Yeah.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.637
To tell you the truth, I'll be
happy when I leave here.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.047
Can I talk to them?

05:38.104 --> 05:39.276
In a minute.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.275
Can you untie their hands

05:41.341 --> 05:43.821
and then… then take those
guns out of their faces?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.015
Is it all here?

05:45.078 --> 05:46.989
Yeah, it's all there. All $2 million of it.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.651
Go ahead and count it if you want.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.092
I intend to.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.061
Those men could be in better shape.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.096
They are no longer young.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.325
Besides, we don't baby our criminals here.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.800
Señor Santini, perhaps you don't...

06:35.795 --> 06:38.503
Did you think you could get away with this?

06:38.598 --> 06:39.941
What do you mean?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.071
I had nothing to do with that chopper.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.705
I delivered my end.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.478
Delivered what? Bullet holes in the sand?

06:46.539 --> 06:48.382
You delivered nothing.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.318
Look, I came to take those prisoners,

06:50.377 --> 06:52.288
and I'm gonna take them back with me.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.883
I have executed men for less
than what you have just done.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.594
Those prisoners cost you $2 million before.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.660
Now they cost $3 million.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.699
Take that message back to United States.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.430
And what if I tell you to go to hell?

07:09.796 --> 07:11.833
Then you will die. Here, now.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.580
And I will find another
way to deliver my message.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.007
Do you want to die for nothing?

07:21.374 --> 07:22.876
Of course not.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.521
Get out of my country.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.057
Come on up, sweetheart.

08:17.464 --> 08:20.377
Well, just what do you mean, Santini is down?

08:20.433 --> 08:22.845
One of our listening posts in southern Florida

08:22.902 --> 08:25.883
picked up a distress call
yesterday at 1900 hours.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.612
He heard the words "Santini Air"

08:27.674 --> 08:28.880
and called it in.

08:29.075 --> 08:30.247
To the Coast Guard?

08:30.310 --> 08:31.448
No, to me.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.784
Does that mean no search
pattern has been started?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.852
He was, overland when he radioed in,

08:38.784 --> 08:40.594
we have a rough position.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.892
You know, anything can go
wrong in a forced landing.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.062
Why the hell haven't you
called out the troops?

08:46.126 --> 08:48.572
Because his course triangulates back to Cuba.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.301
He filed no flight plan

08:50.363 --> 08:52.570
and reported his altitude as 100 feet.

08:52.632 --> 08:54.509
If the authorities get to him first,

08:54.567 --> 08:57.571
the first thing they'll do to
him is hand him his Miranda.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.514
“You have the right to remain silent.”

08:59.572 --> 09:02.212
“Anything you say can and
will be held against you.”

09:02.275 --> 09:04.755
What the hell is Santini doing in Cuba?

09:05.612 --> 09:07.057
Why don't you ask him?

09:07.113 --> 09:08.114
I will.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.388
He's a man who knows the location of Airwolf,

09:10.450 --> 09:11.451
and when he starts junketing off

09:11.484 --> 09:14.021
to the land of rum and fine cigars,

09:14.087 --> 09:15.896
I get a little concerned about him.

09:15.955 --> 09:19.061
I'm goin' after him. I'll
tell him how you care.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.467
Do that.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.237
There is another serious factor

09:22.262 --> 09:24.765
which might shorten your time.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.637
Who created this serious factor?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.940
Only God can create a hurricane.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.342
Get it said, Michael. I'm a busy man.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.174
What's your position, Hawke?

10:06.239 --> 10:07.877
Where are you sitting it out?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.682
At 500 feet.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.746
Are you out of your mind?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.754
Well, Airwolf's holding up fine, but I think

10:17.817 --> 10:20.525
there's better designs for chasing hurricanes.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.693
Set down immediately. That's
an order, do you hear?

10:23.756 --> 10:25.292
You gotta be kiddin'.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.360
All right, it's not an order, it's a request.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.304
Make it a plea for sanity.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.000
No to all 3.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.045
Hawke, the storm will be
over in a couple of hours.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.637
Don't let that angel title go to your head.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.979
Only God can make the weather.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.340
Larry, let me have another.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.160
Hey String, how'd you find me?

12:33.219 --> 12:34.960
Dom, you all right? You're not hurt?

12:35.021 --> 12:36.728
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.664
I was just too down to want to see anybody,

12:39.726 --> 12:41.228
but you're the exception.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.138
Sit down. Sit down. Hey,
give him a drink, will you?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.471
Aren't you gonna drink those?

12:46.532 --> 12:49.308
Well, no. You know I don't
like the taste of booze.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.975
Well, then why'd you order them?

12:52.739 --> 12:54.343
'Cause in the movies

12:54.407 --> 12:56.444
when the… when the world crashes in,

12:56.509 --> 12:58.989
the hero goes down to
the bar and orders drinks.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.718
I respect tradition.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.918
Does it work?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.119
Not yet.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.661
Give him another drink. Have another drink?

13:06.719 --> 13:09.256
Oh, sure, I don't like the stuff, either.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.162
How was the weather in Cuba?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.731
But how… how did you know?

13:16.429 --> 13:19.035
Archangel!

13:20.066 --> 13:23.104
Yeah, one of his listening
posts picked up your mayday.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.018
String, in the last 24 hours,

13:28.074 --> 13:30.782
I've been shot at, ripped off, forced down,

13:30.843 --> 13:32.914
and stuck in the middle of a hurricane.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.017
Let me have another
drink, will you? Him, too.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.696
See, back in 1960, I was a member of a unit

13:40.186 --> 13:42.325
that was sent down to Central America

13:42.388 --> 13:44.891
to train Cuban nationals for the invasion.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.959
Oh, yeah, that set up for the Bay of Pigs.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.562
You told me about that once.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.902
Yeah.

13:50.563 --> 13:55.012
String, those Cuban people were the greatest.

13:56.936 --> 14:00.383
I mean, they weren't mercenaries or killers.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.980
These were the best teachers,

14:03.042 --> 14:06.421
doctors, lawyers, even priests.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.452
They were patriots.

14:11.651 --> 14:14.791
A bunch of anti-Castro patriots got together,

14:14.854 --> 14:18.165
raised enough money to
buy a couple of old-timers

14:18.224 --> 14:20.101
from a corrupt Colonel.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.168
You know that some of them

14:23.229 --> 14:25.505
have been down there for over 20 years?

14:26.899 --> 14:31.439
String, I knew those men,
and I almost had them out.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.085
Almost is not good enough,

14:36.409 --> 14:37.683
Mr. Santini.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.301
You must tell me where the money is.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.969
I told you, we were ripped off.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.376
Don't you understand? We were robbed.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.507
So that Colonel Fernandez
wouldn't turn the men loose.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.444
I don't believe it. You stole it.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.679
$2 million can take someone a long way.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.882
Then why did I come back at all?

15:13.179 --> 15:15.625
This money is the very soul of this community.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.127
Widows and children sent nickels and dimes

15:18.184 --> 15:19.686
to free those people.

15:19.919 --> 15:23.332
This house has more mortgages then roof tiles.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.066
Dominic didn't steal your money.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.900
One lies for the other.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.371
I suggest we lower our voices.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.739
Volume is not going to
bring any truth into this.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.642
Dom, why don't you take a walk?

15:38.704 --> 15:40.706
Let me try and talk to these people.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.979
Yeah, I'd better

15:42.041 --> 15:44.920
before I knock somebody
on her $2 million fanny.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.024
In the old days, we didn't
argue amongst ourselves.

15:52.585 --> 15:53.825
Come on.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.401
Why'd you choose Dom in the first place?

15:59.992 --> 16:02.233
These are the men he was after.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.672
Father Gomez, who spoke against Castro

16:06.732 --> 16:09.076
on the steps of the cathedral in Havana.

16:09.168 --> 16:12.342
Ramon Collarzo, publisher, writer,

16:13.172 --> 16:14.879
and my Father.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.283
Dominic trained these men.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.415
When he called them friends, he meant it.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.428
We chose Mr. Santini because
he could recognize them,

16:25.218 --> 16:27.960
regardless of their physical condition.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.029
If Mr. Santini stole the money,

16:31.524 --> 16:34.164
he has condemned my son to die in Cuba.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.271
Look, that collection was no secret.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.002
The money was headed for Cuba.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.340
All a thief would have to
know is when and where.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.175
Impossible. Our people would never do it.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.578
Your people are so pure
there's none you worry about?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.879
Not even the Marielitos?

16:47.940 --> 16:49.112
They are not our people.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.449
They're Cubans.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.512
You have no idea what you're talking about.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.615
The Marielitos are too busy

16:54.680 --> 16:57.991
fighting among themselves to plan or organize.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.290
Sanchez is organized.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.935
What are you saying, Grandfather?

17:06.992 --> 17:09.940
Something I should have told you, but didn't.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.702
Come here.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.047
You must know the truth.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.207
We needed $2 million to save these people.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.044
And we raised it.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.913
We raised $1 million.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.958
$1 million I borrowed from Sanchez.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.186
What?

17:30.316 --> 17:32.193
How could you do this?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.690
Do you know what you've made us?

17:41.994 --> 17:46.409
My granddaughter burns with a bright flame.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.673
There's a generation of Cubans

17:49.735 --> 17:52.477
who have never known Cuba, Mr. Hawke.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.717
For them, it is the old country.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.253
But now, with our heroes
back from Castro's jails,

18:02.548 --> 18:06.860
our cause could grow
young again, and flourish.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.098
We could easily raise and pay back $1 million.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.403
This was my plan.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.838
You know, politics is a hard game.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.132
A game for old men...

18:23.536 --> 18:25.516
not bright flames.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.261
He has no idea what he's done.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.035
I think he does.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.201
I have a great deal of respect for the man.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.639
But to deal with Sanchez, a ruthless killer,

18:51.697 --> 18:54.143
drug smuggler, God knows what else.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.844
There isn't a man that works for him

18:56.902 --> 18:58.848
that doesn't have marks.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.042
Marks?

19:00.106 --> 19:03.576
Tattoos. Inside the lip, near the thumb.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.757
It's a code from the Cuban prisons.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.223
3 dots is a robber, 4 is a killer.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.029
And what is 1 dot?

19:15.087 --> 19:16.623
A political prisoner.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.135
I put it there in sympathy.
It's what my Father wears.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.973
Where would one find this Sanchez?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.604
He has a camp on an island in the Keys.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.081
He has his own private
army, arms, and training.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.178
Things that we would love
to have, but can't afford.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.413
Helicopters?

19:36.475 --> 19:37.977
Yes, probably.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.988
But why would Sanchez rob Mr. Santini?

19:44.617 --> 19:46.153
Half the money was his.

19:46.218 --> 19:47.492
Half wasn't.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.496
You'll do anything to save
your friend, won't you?

19:54.660 --> 19:55.866
I'm still not sure

19:55.928 --> 19:58.033
Santini didn't make up this whole story.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.703
If you knew him like I do, you'd believe him.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.712
It gets harder and harder
to believe in anything,

20:04.437 --> 20:08.112
except someday, my Father will be set free.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.284
You just have to keep trying.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.486
The only thing I can offer
is that I understand.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.593
I really do.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.547
Stella told me the approximate
location of the camp,

20:40.606 --> 20:43.416
but I still think some pointed
questions are in order.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.581
You would go there unarmed?

20:46.545 --> 20:50.322
Well, not exactly. And not alone, either.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.257
I need Mr. Santini.

20:53.319 --> 20:54.354
No.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.291
Stella, please.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.561
Mr. Santini has been involved in my life

20:59.625 --> 21:01.627
for almost as long as you.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.533
I'm not convinced he's a thief.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.587
Do you see anything yet?

21:16.642 --> 21:19.987
Oh, yeah. Mansions, swimming pools, Jacuzzis.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.384
No unpopulated islands yet.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.293
I'm gonna cover the east quadrant.

21:25.351 --> 21:28.230
Then I'll swing around for a north-south scan.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.097
I'll sure miss the view
of expensive real estate.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.677
There's one ahead of us.
You see anything yet?

21:41.734 --> 21:44.271
Sand and coral. No, hold it, String.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.745
We have a couple of blips.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.848
You sure it's not a heated pool?

21:53.913 --> 21:55.551
I'm sure because the lifeguard

21:55.614 --> 21:58.288
is carrying a .50 caliber on his dune buggy.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.886
Let's go take a look.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.999
I am showing you the newest

22:13.065 --> 22:15.443
of hand-launched, heat-seeking missiles,

22:15.501 --> 22:18.505
and you want to know,
can it blow a bank vault?

22:20.139 --> 22:21.140
Estupido.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.013
That's US equipment they're playing with.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.146
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

25:16.949 --> 25:19.088
Didn't I say, I came to talk?

25:19.651 --> 25:21.289
What do you want?

25:21.754 --> 25:24.564
Ivan Rivera and I would like some answers.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.696
From the looks of your equipment,

25:28.761 --> 25:31.037
I can see where $2 million would go.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.643
That's not how I paid for these weapons.

25:34.733 --> 25:37.043
It is, till you prove different.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.074
Can I call that jeep here?

25:41.373 --> 25:44.217
Yeah, just tell him to keep it in low gear.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.122
If you don't know how to use one,

25:57.189 --> 25:59.191
I'll be glad to show you.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.171
Archangel.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.438
Hawke?

26:11.503 --> 26:13.540
What are you doing on this channel?

26:26.418 --> 26:29.058
We spend months establishing Camp Freedom,

26:29.121 --> 26:31.829
and you and Airwolf waste it in 10 minutes.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.665
Camp Freedom.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.931
You really are amazing, Michael.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.406
You give a bunch of criminals
sophisticated weaponry

26:38.464 --> 26:40.307
and you call it Camp Freedom?

26:40.365 --> 26:43.209
Hawke, you've got to tune
into the bigger picture.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.776
These men were being trained
to combat communist insurgents

26:46.839 --> 26:48.546
in Central American trouble spots.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.644
Well, I guess I'm just
not sophisticated enough

26:50.709 --> 26:53.121
to judge the morality of
using a bunch of pirates

26:53.178 --> 26:55.385
to fight Uncle Sam's battles.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.087
I'm sure the newspapers
will give you a better shake.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.527
You're not serious?

26:59.918 --> 27:01.158
And the White House

27:01.220 --> 27:03.325
doesn't know anything about this, I'll bet.

27:03.388 --> 27:04.992
They shouldn't hold a grudge against the Firm

27:05.023 --> 27:07.833
for more than a couple of budget years.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.100
You're talking about blackmail.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.937
Not until I ask for something.

27:11.997 --> 27:13.635
What are you asking for?

27:13.699 --> 27:16.009
$3 million, cash.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.681
You're insane.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.741
Anybody got the number of The Washington Post?

27:29.414 --> 27:31.052
Okay, you got it.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.530
It is still blackmail.

27:37.289 --> 27:40.270
But Marella, you're just not
seeing the bigger picture.

27:43.428 --> 27:46.807
Red Star? Red Star, this is Venus.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.239
Come in.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.776
Red Star?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.510
This is Venus. Come in, please.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.009
Red Star, this is Venus. Come in.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.512
They're not answering.

28:00.045 --> 28:01.524
Try it again.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.623
Red Star, this is Venus. Come in.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.063
This is Red Star. Go ahead.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.137
Arrangements have been completed on this end.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.863
We are waiting for your instructions.

28:17.563 --> 28:20.703
We will be expecting shipment at 1200 hours.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.146
Message confirmed.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.706
This is your last chance.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.649
Confirmed. Out.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.227
What's that for?

28:43.288 --> 28:46.360
For making it possible
to bring my Father home.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.832
He's not home, yet.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.873
I'll get Dom and we'll make the transfer.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.641
You won't be making the delivery.

29:00.806 --> 29:02.308
That's a joke, right?

29:02.374 --> 29:03.614
It is no joke.

29:04.042 --> 29:07.512
We want to make sure that
nothing goes wrong this time.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.792
Meaning Dominic? You can't do that.

29:09.848 --> 29:12.055
You have no right to take the moment from him.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.892
We have every right.

29:14.786 --> 29:17.767
We want this to be an all-Cuban operation.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.565
This has nothing to do with you.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.003
Yes, it does.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.371
We can't take the chance.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.032
What are you gonna trade
for your Father, an IOU?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.976
You'd withhold the money?

29:29.034 --> 29:32.811
No, I simply trade for trust.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.098
My apologies, Mr. Hawke,

29:53.158 --> 29:55.399
but the committee's decision is final.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.365
We hired a pilot.

29:57.996 --> 30:01.136
Now, if you will just deliver the money.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.843
I don't think so.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.641
You are forcing our hand.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.383
To do what? Shoot me?

30:12.978 --> 30:14.184
If that's the case,

30:14.246 --> 30:16.954
you'd better add 3 dots to your lower lip

30:17.015 --> 30:18.790
and go to work for Sanchez.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.359
If I've got to gamble on people,

30:22.421 --> 30:24.560
I'd just as soon it was you.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.830
You're not killing anybody.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.876
You win, Mr. Hawke.

30:33.932 --> 30:36.776
No, you win, Mr. Rivera.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.742
Would you at least take one of us along

30:42.140 --> 30:44.017
to satisfy our people?

30:57.756 --> 30:59.531
Best bottle of wine in the house.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.265
You'd think with $3 million
on the seat between us,

31:02.327 --> 31:04.705
a vintage Bordeaux would be more appropriate.

31:04.896 --> 31:06.933
With $3 million on the seat between us,

31:06.998 --> 31:09.706
not advertising it would be appropriate.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.412
Well, they don't look too dangerous to me.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.974
Only to some species of marine life.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.450
I suppose it would be pointless of me to ask

31:17.509 --> 31:20.922
to what end this exorbitant
outlay of cash is intended.

31:20.979 --> 31:22.652
That's right, pointless.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.954
I figured.

31:24.015 --> 31:25.619
All set, String.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.390
All we need now is the money.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.064
Here, let me help you.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.668
This is one kind of baggage I enjoy handling.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.976
Stringfellow, who are these people?

31:41.099 --> 31:42.806
Why are they being so generous?

31:42.868 --> 31:44.142
Good question.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.739
They, represent a firm that makes covers

31:46.805 --> 31:48.751
to keep things under wraps.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.976
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

31:51.042 --> 31:53.044
We'll be back in about 3 hours.

31:53.111 --> 31:55.887
I think you'll enjoy what
your money brings back.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.119
You ready? Come on.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.332
Listen, you take it easy.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.693
No kick the tires, lighting fires stuff.

32:05.757 --> 32:06.758
Milk run.

32:06.825 --> 32:07.963
Okay.

32:14.966 --> 32:18.175
He's on his way back across
the straits to Cuba, isn't he?

32:18.236 --> 32:20.113
You know, I think the next
bottle of wine we buy

32:20.138 --> 32:23.142
better be a cheap one. I'm broke.

32:29.414 --> 32:32.725
We're on our way back.
You still think I'm a thief?

32:33.752 --> 32:35.925
We've got about 100 miles to go,

32:35.987 --> 32:38.729
and I'm watching the compass all the way.

32:44.529 --> 32:46.031
How much longer?

32:46.431 --> 32:50.379
Michael, they just took off.
Give them a little time.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.106
It's been 30 minutes.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.276
You could've been to Havana
and back in Airwolf.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.944
Santini's not flying Airwolf, is he?

32:58.009 --> 32:59.920
Of course not, Michael.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.586
Thanks.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.027
Listen, will you excuse me just a moment?

34:37.809 --> 34:39.914
Should we try and find him?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.350
No.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.987
If he wants to play this without our help,

34:49.054 --> 34:50.795
we'll just let him.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.637
Why don't you say something?

35:03.101 --> 35:04.580
What's the matter with you?

35:04.636 --> 35:06.946
There is nothing the matter with them.

35:07.372 --> 35:10.114
They are loyal to me, and I do the talking.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.447
I hope we'll be able to talk

35:12.510 --> 35:14.490
as one military man to another.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.548
We do work for the same firm, after all.

35:16.615 --> 35:17.958
I work for myself.

35:18.016 --> 35:20.496
And you built that combat
helicopter all by yourself

35:20.552 --> 35:22.498
out of, old tractor parts?

35:24.155 --> 35:26.601
I would like such a tractor myself.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.532
Sorry, I'm fresh out.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.364
Then will you lend me the one you drive?

35:31.429 --> 35:32.965
Just for a few years?

35:33.031 --> 35:34.135
Long enough for you to

35:34.165 --> 35:37.203
overthrow the small country of your choice?

35:37.369 --> 35:38.905
We think alike.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.447
No chance.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.841
Your friend and, the Rivera girl

35:42.907 --> 35:45.183
will soon be entering Cuban air space.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.148
I could let my colleague in Cuba

35:48.213 --> 35:50.056
go through with his original plan,

35:50.115 --> 35:51.958
and you will never see them again.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.089
Or, they can come home with the prisoners.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.100
What hold have you got
over that Cuban Colonel?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.567
He needs me.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.604
What he is doing is against Cuban law.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.866
He needs my support, my helicopters.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.102
And to think at one time he was my jailer.

36:07.198 --> 36:09.474
Now we both work on the same side,

36:09.534 --> 36:10.979
as you and I will.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.572
I'm afraid not.

36:14.305 --> 36:17.684
Then your friend will spend
20 years in a Cuban prison,

36:17.742 --> 36:20.586
and I assure you, it will be hell on earth.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.696
We'll be in Cuba in 10 minutes.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.165
I hope you're convinced now

36:36.227 --> 36:38.730
that I didn't steal your $2 million.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.340
I guess so.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.607
Did you really know my Father?

36:43.968 --> 36:46.949
I did, and a braver man I never knew.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.078
I have met some daughters
just as brave, though.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.804
Now open the hatch if you please, Mr. Hawke.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.465
We are waiting, Mr. Hawke.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.407
The cabin's pressurized.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.736
You have to back up a little.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.538
Yeah, yeah, okay, Colonel,

38:23.601 --> 38:25.308
we've been through this before.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.815
Now show us the men.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.400
So good to see you again, señor Santini.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.497
Likewise, I'm sure.

39:25.496 --> 39:27.476
There, go ahead, count it.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.076
I see you have brought

39:29.100 --> 39:32.013
a beautiful señorita with you this time.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.277
I'm sorry I cannot do the same.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.682
All I have are...

39:45.083 --> 39:47.654
You're a slimy, lying piece of garbage!

41:54.078 --> 41:55.352
Let's go home.

42:24.475 --> 42:25.818
Ataque.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.203
Come on, move that donkey cart.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.007
Going to be a long 90 miles.

42:50.068 --> 42:53.072
You just cool your tail rotor there, hotshot.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.545
Besides, without me and that ship

42:55.606 --> 42:57.108
to keep you out of trouble,

42:57.175 --> 42:59.177
it's you I'm worried about.

43:00.545 --> 43:02.388
I take it back, String.

43:02.447 --> 43:04.484
It's me I'm worried about.

43:08.619 --> 43:10.621
He popped a Sidewinder.

43:10.688 --> 43:12.599
Radar guidance or infrared?

43:12.690 --> 43:15.261
I don't know, I can't see it from here.

44:27.398 --> 44:30.436
String, get this thing off my tail, will you?

44:37.241 --> 44:39.585
Hang on, Dom. I'll be your decoy.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.550
Not bad, String.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.823
You wrote your own flight manual, there.

45:28.459 --> 45:30.029
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:30.094 --> 45:32.734
the Captain has put on the "no smoking" sign.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.776
Please fasten your seat belts
as we prepare for our landing

45:37.034 --> 45:40.379
in los Estados Unidos, in Norteamérica.

46:10.868 --> 46:12.541
No, not at all, Mr. Rivera.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.311
We at the Firm have always
considered your organization

46:15.373 --> 46:18.354
to be a vital link in
our Latin American effort.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.151
Then why did you arm Sanchez and not us?

46:23.547 --> 46:26.255
Of course, now that our heroes are home,

46:26.317 --> 46:27.853
things have changed.

46:27.918 --> 46:30.228
Absolutely, and we would
like to work with you

46:30.288 --> 46:31.767
a lot more closely.

46:31.822 --> 46:34.428
Perhaps. Let us examine your proposal.

46:38.529 --> 46:41.237
Say, String, did I ever thank you

46:41.299 --> 46:43.609
for bucking that hurricane to find me?

46:43.668 --> 46:44.703
Nope.

46:44.769 --> 46:46.305
Did I ever thank you

46:46.370 --> 46:47.974
for bailing me out with the Riveras,

46:48.039 --> 46:49.712
not to mention the MiG?

46:49.774 --> 46:51.082
No.

46:51.442 --> 46:54.616
Well, hell, then I owe you
about 3 more drinks.

46:54.679 --> 46:56.818
Larry, 3 more rounds.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.760
Attaboy.

46:58.949 --> 47:02.522
Well, these beers are going to
end up costing us $30 each.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.327
Easy come, easy go.

47:06.305 --> 47:12.671
