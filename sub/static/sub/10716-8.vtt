WEBVTT

00:20.889 --> 00:23.024
Okay. I'm good.
All yours.

00:23.092 --> 00:24.726
Can we get a priority
on the GSR?

00:24.793 --> 00:26.128
Roger that.

00:26.195 --> 00:28.029
He's gonna have
gunshot residue
on his hand.

00:28.097 --> 00:30.065
Won't prove anything
one way or another.

00:30.132 --> 00:31.200
If somebody
staged this,

00:31.266 --> 00:32.501
they would have
accounted for that.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.069
We gotta dot the "I"s,
don't we?

00:34.136 --> 00:35.937
Always.

00:36.004 --> 00:38.006
Always dot the "I"s.

00:38.073 --> 00:40.209
One shot expended.

00:42.844 --> 00:43.978
- Detective?
- Mm-hm.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.314
You're gonna want to
take a look at this.

00:45.380 --> 00:48.250
- How recent are those?
- A day or two.

00:48.317 --> 00:51.153
Hm. Maybe he was into
a little kink.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.587
That's just
between us for now.

00:52.654 --> 00:53.522
Roger that.

00:53.588 --> 00:55.090
I'm gonna take
a look around.

00:55.157 --> 00:56.325
Mm-hm.

00:57.992 --> 00:58.960
He sent a text.

00:59.128 --> 01:00.429
Thanks.

01:14.843 --> 01:17.146
Drake.
Maury.

01:21.783 --> 01:24.986
Shoot that, bag it
and get it to me.

01:25.053 --> 01:26.421
Coniff.

01:28.190 --> 01:31.059
12:15 a text was sent
to George Irving's cell.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.628
Sorry, partner,
I let you down.

01:33.695 --> 01:35.564
So five minutes before
he bought the farm,

01:35.630 --> 01:37.266
he texted an apology
to his dead partner,

01:37.332 --> 01:39.301
- and then he
shot himself?
- Apparently.

01:39.368 --> 01:41.570
You have your doubts,
Detective?

01:41.636 --> 01:43.538
To me,
that sells it as suicide.

01:43.605 --> 01:46.074
If this is his phone
and he actually sent
the message.

01:46.175 --> 01:47.075
Why wouldn't it be?

01:47.176 --> 01:48.543
Keeping an
open mind, sir.

01:48.610 --> 01:50.044
This is a burner,
after all,

01:50.179 --> 01:51.313
and there's only
one message on it.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.081
He was dirty.
Of course he had a burner.

01:53.182 --> 01:54.549
His personal cell phone
is missing.

01:54.616 --> 01:57.018
He got rid of it.
Any number of reasons.

01:57.085 --> 01:58.553
Or somebody took it.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.055
All right,
what else have we got?

02:01.190 --> 02:04.092
Surveillance heard
the gunshot...

02:04.193 --> 02:05.594
at 12:20 a.m.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.596
Contact attempted,
no response.

02:07.662 --> 02:09.531
SWAT called
to make an entry.

02:09.598 --> 02:12.267
Arrived on the scene
at 1:45.

02:12.334 --> 02:13.868
Entry was made
30 minutes later.

02:13.935 --> 02:16.205
If somebody else was in
the house when he died,

02:16.238 --> 02:18.006
they had time to go
out the backdoor.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.441
Past our team
in the alley?

02:21.075 --> 02:22.344
They'd gone
to find a head.

02:22.411 --> 02:23.278
Oh.

02:23.345 --> 02:24.979
If they had eyes
on our surveillance,

02:25.046 --> 02:26.848
they would have known
when to pull the trigger.

02:26.915 --> 02:32.921
You know, sometimes things are
just as they seem, detectives.

02:34.823 --> 02:37.359
And this, to me,

02:37.426 --> 02:40.462
is one of those times.

02:40.529 --> 02:42.697
I'm looking forward to
reading your report.

02:49.271 --> 02:50.272
Did you hear
what I just heard?

02:50.339 --> 02:51.406
What did you hear?

02:51.473 --> 02:53.141
That he wants this
to be a suicide.

02:53.242 --> 02:54.243
Needs it even.

02:54.243 --> 02:55.677
Yeah, well, fuck him.

02:55.744 --> 02:58.347
I'm not shading my report
for anybody.

02:58.413 --> 03:00.482
Not even
the Chief of Ds.

03:15.930 --> 03:16.898
Bosch.

03:19.301 --> 03:21.169
Something come up?

03:21.270 --> 03:22.837
30 minutes.

03:40.889 --> 03:41.856
Dad.

03:44.293 --> 03:45.827
Dad?

03:48.297 --> 03:51.600
**

04:09.318 --> 04:11.986
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:12.053 --> 04:14.723
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:14.789 --> 04:17.459
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:17.526 --> 04:19.994
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:20.061 --> 04:22.831
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:22.897 --> 04:24.933
* Got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:24.999 --> 04:28.136
* I got a feelin'
that I can't let go *

04:28.202 --> 04:31.139
* Can't let go *

04:31.205 --> 04:34.343
**

04:42.384 --> 04:44.986
* I feel *

04:52.894 --> 04:54.696
It's him.

04:54.763 --> 04:58.132
Autopsy will confirm,
but it's him.

04:58.199 --> 05:00.369
It's Burrell.

05:00.435 --> 05:03.372
Yeah, I'm sure.

05:03.438 --> 05:05.374
St. Jude's medal
in his pocket.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.377
Wife's initials
on the back.

05:08.443 --> 05:11.380
She gave it to him
when he took this assignment.

05:13.882 --> 05:15.850
I told her.

05:15.917 --> 05:17.952
I didn't tell her
he'd been tortured.

05:20.021 --> 05:22.424
All the bones
in his hands and feet.

05:28.029 --> 05:30.999
For Silver,
that text is as good as
a signed suicide note.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.202
Suicide solves
a lot of problems
on the tenth floor.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.704
Two dead cops,
friends.

05:35.770 --> 05:39.007
One a hero, one a criminal
overcome with remorse.

05:39.073 --> 05:41.543
They'll call it a suicide,
but we both know it's not.

05:41.610 --> 05:42.977
That works for Nash,
too.

05:43.044 --> 05:45.647
He went to the trouble.
Suicide buys him time.

05:45.714 --> 05:47.616
- For what?
- The big payday.

05:47.682 --> 05:50.284
Pot of gold that
connects all of this.

05:50.419 --> 05:51.420
Allen's murder
to your son's,

05:51.420 --> 05:52.654
and Nash to both.

05:52.721 --> 05:55.023
Take a look at
these photos Nash took.

05:57.826 --> 05:59.494
Tony Allen was
leaving his wife for her,

05:59.561 --> 06:00.429
the younger woman.

06:00.462 --> 06:01.563
He was gonna marry her.

06:01.630 --> 06:03.197
He was gonna take
his money with him.

06:03.264 --> 06:06.435
Now, Veronica needs a partner
to stop that from happening.

06:06.435 --> 06:07.836
Nash.

06:07.902 --> 06:10.238
So he's waiting to get paid
for killing her husband.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.206
- And you're sure there's
a pot of gold?
- I'm betting on it.

06:12.273 --> 06:15.176
- So how do we find it?
- We've been watching
the widow.

06:15.243 --> 06:16.445
She's been waiting, too.

06:16.478 --> 06:18.447
Waiting for the estate
to settle.

06:18.447 --> 06:20.148
She'll lead us to
the money.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.451
That'll lead us to Nash.

06:22.517 --> 06:24.453
Follow the money.

06:25.286 --> 06:26.721
Follow the fuckin' money.

06:34.362 --> 06:35.730
Bosch.

06:39.501 --> 06:41.302
You know Coniff
and Espinosa.

06:41.369 --> 06:43.104
Yeah,
Brad and I go back.

06:43.171 --> 06:45.740
The RHD task force
on George Irving's murder

06:45.807 --> 06:48.309
is now investigating
the death of Eddie Arceneaux.

06:48.376 --> 06:50.979
You guys callin' it
a suicide or a murder?

06:51.045 --> 06:53.214
We're calling it
undetermined at this time.

06:53.281 --> 06:55.383
Two nights ago
you gave me Carl Nash's name

06:55.484 --> 06:56.485
as a lead in
the Irving killing.

06:56.518 --> 06:57.486
Check him out?

06:57.552 --> 06:58.953
Working on it.

07:00.054 --> 07:01.523
Nash left LAPD
under a cloud,

07:01.590 --> 07:02.557
at least
that's the story.

07:02.624 --> 07:04.025
The story's true.

07:04.092 --> 07:05.193
What'd he do?

07:05.259 --> 07:06.828
Corrupt. Brutal.

07:06.895 --> 07:08.930
Ton of his cases
were tainted.

07:08.997 --> 07:11.199
Big ugly can of worms
nobody wanted opened.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.803
So IA bounced him on
some bullshit technicality.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.971
Who told you
Nash sold guns to Arceneaux?

07:17.038 --> 07:18.106
Confidential informant.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.842
Any chance that informant
was Eddie Arceneaux?

07:20.909 --> 07:23.745
Arceneaux wasn't
one of my CIs.

07:23.812 --> 07:28.016
You know,
there are informants who
cooperate voluntarily.

07:28.082 --> 07:31.520
And then there are those
who are forced to.

07:31.586 --> 07:33.154
Found that in
his trashcan.

07:33.221 --> 07:35.189
- It was used on someone.
- So what? He's a cop.

07:35.256 --> 07:37.959
Arceneaux had marks
on his wrist consistent
with that cuff.

07:38.026 --> 07:40.361
You're suggesting
I forced Arceneaux to
give me Nash's name?

07:40.428 --> 07:42.030
All right,
that's outrageous.

07:42.096 --> 07:43.064
Did you?

07:43.131 --> 07:44.533
Piss off.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.637
Detectives.
Where's this going?

07:48.703 --> 07:50.539
Bosch and Edgar
have got a case to work.

07:50.572 --> 07:51.940
We've got a case
to work, too.

07:52.006 --> 07:53.407
We're investigating
the murder of

07:53.542 --> 07:54.709
a brave young
undercover officer,

07:54.776 --> 07:56.344
not some mobbed up
piece of shit pornographer,

07:56.410 --> 07:58.980
so if you have information
we should have, now's the time.

07:59.047 --> 08:01.049
I'm drawing up
a warrant today
for Nash's house.

08:01.115 --> 08:02.751
When we're good to go,
we'll give you a call.

08:02.817 --> 08:05.419
Maybe we find something
helps us both out.

08:05.554 --> 08:07.421
All we wanted.
A little cooperation.

08:07.556 --> 08:08.657
You got it.

08:19.668 --> 08:22.771
You two aren't
going anywhere.

08:22.837 --> 08:25.273
How did you connect Nash
to Arceneaux and their case?

08:25.339 --> 08:28.109
Our sources at Van Nuys
said Nash was the guy in
the Valley

08:28.176 --> 08:30.411
to see for a throw away.
I passed it along.

08:30.478 --> 08:31.445
And you didn't tell me
because...

08:31.580 --> 08:33.748
Not our case, RHDs.
Hands off.

08:33.815 --> 08:36.585
Is there anything else
you're not telling me?

08:36.618 --> 08:38.286
Not that I can think of.

08:39.588 --> 08:40.855
We could use
some extra hands

08:40.922 --> 08:43.491
to help surveille
Veronica Allen.

08:43.592 --> 08:44.993
I can give you
two shifts.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.261
Johnson and Moore,
Ferris and Roberts.

08:47.328 --> 08:48.429
Beautiful.

08:48.496 --> 08:51.432
- Bosch.
- Yeah.

08:51.499 --> 08:53.968
Let's get
a cup of coffee.

08:55.236 --> 08:57.706
Harry, I know you're
off the reservation.

08:57.772 --> 09:00.609
What I don't know is
if you've got company.

09:00.675 --> 09:02.310
Not sure I follow you,
Lieutenant.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.845
I know it's not Edgar.

09:03.912 --> 09:06.247
He's as much
in the dark as I am
about what you're up to.

09:10.685 --> 09:14.322
I got a friend who
works out at a gym near PAB.

09:14.388 --> 09:18.059
He says that Irving's
in there every day at lunch.

09:18.126 --> 09:21.129
Hitting the heavy bag.
Wearing it out.

09:21.195 --> 09:22.030
Bare knuckled.

09:22.096 --> 09:24.398
He's grieving, angry.
Your point?

09:24.465 --> 09:27.636
People get desperate,
they get dangerous.

09:27.636 --> 09:28.770
They do damage.

09:28.837 --> 09:30.672
To themselves
and others.

09:30.739 --> 09:31.706
Thanks for the warning.

09:34.643 --> 09:35.977
Bosch.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.288
Sorry I kept you waiting.

09:47.355 --> 09:49.490
Thanks for meeting me
on such short notice.

09:49.557 --> 09:50.659
On a Saturday.

09:50.725 --> 09:53.527
Not a problem.

09:53.662 --> 09:54.829
We found him.

09:54.896 --> 09:57.565
Right where you thought
he would be.

09:57.666 --> 09:59.600
I'm so sorry.

09:59.668 --> 10:01.102
Can't even imagine
what that family's

10:01.169 --> 10:03.437
been going through
the last two years.

10:03.504 --> 10:07.275
The director asked me
to convey his thanks.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.910
I appreciate that.

10:08.977 --> 10:11.646
He authorized the amendment
to your record.

10:11.713 --> 10:13.748
Your flag
will be removed.

10:13.815 --> 10:16.450
Any idea how long
that will take?

10:16.517 --> 10:18.653
You know bureaucracies.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.488
All too well.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.555
In the interim,

10:21.622 --> 10:22.824
I have a letter of
recommendation

10:22.891 --> 10:24.826
signed by the director.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.895
That ought to
open a few doors.

10:32.433 --> 10:33.567
Thank you.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.602
I wish I could do more.

10:34.669 --> 10:36.370
vis-à-vis
the bureau itself.

10:36.437 --> 10:40.608
No, no, I understand.

10:40.675 --> 10:43.144
A fresh start.

10:44.612 --> 10:47.215
Yeah. A fresh start.

10:58.693 --> 11:01.863
What's good
on this roach coach?

11:01.930 --> 11:03.297
Tacos al pastor.

11:03.364 --> 11:04.799
I don't even know
what the hell that is,

11:04.866 --> 11:06.067
but I've had my shots.

11:06.134 --> 11:07.836
Excuse me, can I, uh,
please have--

11:07.902 --> 11:10.972
Uno mas taco al pastor,
por favor.

11:12.006 --> 11:13.607
Burrell was
a good guy.

11:13.742 --> 11:14.743
Didn't deserve to
end up in a hole

11:14.809 --> 11:16.745
in the middle of
the desert.

11:16.778 --> 11:17.946
You tie Marks
to his murder?

11:18.012 --> 11:20.414
Sure as hell
gonna try.

11:20.481 --> 11:22.516
If the blood
in Tony's trunk
is Burrell's,

11:22.583 --> 11:24.886
they'll file RICO charges
against Marks and his top guy,

11:24.953 --> 11:26.120
see if they get
one of them to flip.

11:26.187 --> 11:28.156
You won't have to
testify.

11:28.222 --> 11:30.658
I told you, man,
I like bein'
Lucky Luke Rykoff,

11:30.759 --> 11:33.194
it suits me.

11:33.261 --> 11:35.764
So, look,
I just wanted to come by
and thank you in person.

11:35.830 --> 11:38.366
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.834
I don't believe you.

11:39.901 --> 11:42.771
I hope it all works out,
you know, for your ex.

11:42.837 --> 11:44.638
Still don't know what
you're talkin' about.

11:44.773 --> 11:46.674
You're a shitty liar.

11:48.076 --> 11:51.045
That mean you don't believe
I planted that gun?

11:51.112 --> 11:52.781
No, we're officially cool,
you and me.

11:52.847 --> 11:55.784
That's good to hear.

11:55.817 --> 11:57.518
What about that tail
you've had on me

11:57.585 --> 11:58.887
the last three weeks?

12:00.654 --> 12:01.622
You knew about that shit?

12:01.689 --> 12:02.556
Uh-huh.

12:02.623 --> 12:03.657
Well, fuck you.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.794
We pulled it off you
this morning.

12:07.428 --> 12:09.798
You really want to
do something for me,
Rykoff?

12:09.831 --> 12:11.465
It depends.

12:11.532 --> 12:15.503
We think we know
who planted the gun
in your bathroom.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.871
Now I'm interested.

12:16.938 --> 12:18.840
An ex LAPD
homicide detective

12:18.907 --> 12:20.809
who orchestrated
the hit on Tony Allen.

12:20.809 --> 12:22.877
Wanted it to look like
it came from Joey Marks.

12:22.944 --> 12:25.513
So he framed me?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.816
Fuck that guy.
Why?

12:27.849 --> 12:31.252
Money. Love.
Maybe both.

12:31.319 --> 12:33.387
We think he's involved
with Veronica Allen,

12:33.454 --> 12:34.688
Tony's widow.

12:34.823 --> 12:36.124
Cooked it up together?

12:36.190 --> 12:37.558
That's the
working theory.

12:37.625 --> 12:38.993
You know anything?

12:39.060 --> 12:43.264
Well,
I don't know anything
about the love angle,

12:43.331 --> 12:44.732
but I can help you
with the money.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.467
So Tony was
skimming the skim.

12:46.534 --> 12:49.337
Joey expected him to
steal a certain amount
within reason.

12:49.403 --> 12:50.839
Can't trust a guy
who's too honest,

12:50.872 --> 12:52.006
he might be
an undercover cop.

12:52.073 --> 12:55.844
But suddenly
two years ago,

12:55.877 --> 12:57.078
Tony starts
stealing more.

12:57.145 --> 12:59.080
Yeah, lots more.
Hand over fist.

12:59.147 --> 13:00.748
How do you know about
two years ago?

13:00.849 --> 13:02.083
That's when he
met Layla.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.452
Layla.
Well, there you go.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.487
There's your
love connection
right there, man.

13:06.554 --> 13:09.190
See, Joey asked me to
go back over Dolly's books,

13:09.257 --> 13:10.892
which I do, and I
come up with this number.

13:10.959 --> 13:13.862
And I multiply that number
times the other clubs
in his rackets,

13:13.928 --> 13:15.729
and, you know, I get
a pretty good guesstimate.

13:15.864 --> 13:16.898
How much?

13:16.965 --> 13:18.867
Three and a half,
four million bucks.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.869
No shit?
In just two years?

13:20.869 --> 13:21.936
Yeah, but you gotta
understand.

13:22.003 --> 13:24.138
Tony was washing
all of Joey's cash.

13:24.205 --> 13:27.075
From the clubs,
the girls, credit cards,
drugs, like, all of it.

13:27.141 --> 13:29.343
That's a lot of
skim to skim.

13:29.410 --> 13:30.078
What did Marks do?

13:30.144 --> 13:32.413
Ugh. He drove to L.A.,

13:32.480 --> 13:34.883
and accused Tony to his face
of ripping him off,

13:34.916 --> 13:37.285
which, of course,
Tony denied.

13:37.351 --> 13:39.988
Which is when
Nash and Veronica
figured the frame.

13:40.054 --> 13:41.022
They overheard
the fight.

13:41.089 --> 13:42.891
It's a smart play.
Right?

13:42.957 --> 13:46.194
Tony gets whacked,
everyone assumes it's Joey
that puts him down.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.561
And then you show up
at my place,

13:47.628 --> 13:49.663
and you pull that gun
out of my toilet,

13:49.730 --> 13:52.133
I'm thinkin',
"Fuck. This guy's
on Joey's payroll.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.902
"He's gonna frame me
to take the fall."

13:53.935 --> 13:54.903
Yeah, but what about
all the cash.

13:54.969 --> 13:56.304
They ever recover it?

13:56.370 --> 13:58.907
As far as I know,
it's still out there.

13:59.941 --> 14:01.175
Hey, I gotta go.

14:01.242 --> 14:02.810
They do not like me
hanging out in public

14:02.911 --> 14:04.712
with suspicious looking
characters.

14:05.947 --> 14:08.917
Hey. Luke.
Luke Goshen.

14:08.917 --> 14:11.920
Good to meet you,
Luke Goshen.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.787
So what's next for you?

14:13.922 --> 14:15.356
They'll find
a spot for me.

14:15.423 --> 14:17.758
Besides, now I got some
serious fuckin' bona fides

14:17.825 --> 14:18.927
with that murder charge.

14:18.927 --> 14:21.095
- With the Bratva?
- Yeah.

14:21.162 --> 14:23.264
Fuckin'-A,
with those guys
you gotta bring it.

14:23.331 --> 14:25.333
So you're a triple agent?
Russians, too?

14:25.399 --> 14:28.937
It takes a big man
to do a big job, Bosch.

14:28.970 --> 14:31.539
You.
I'll see you again.

14:35.009 --> 14:36.277
What's up, baby?

14:55.964 --> 14:57.966
Mom,
where have you been?

14:57.966 --> 14:59.267
I had an
important meeting.

15:01.769 --> 15:02.971
Are we still
going shopping?

15:02.971 --> 15:05.506
Oh, right. God, I just
came up that hill.

15:05.573 --> 15:07.875
I don't know how your father
lives up here.

15:07.976 --> 15:09.743
I need clothes
for school.

15:09.810 --> 15:13.314
Okay, we'll go.
But first, I want to
show you something.

15:24.025 --> 15:25.459
Wow, this is amazing.

15:25.526 --> 15:26.894
So they're
finally admitting
they were wrong

15:26.995 --> 15:28.429
about what they
did to you?

15:28.496 --> 15:31.399
Well, the important thing is
they're clearing my record.

15:31.465 --> 15:33.867
Helps me get back to doing
what I was doing before.

15:34.002 --> 15:35.369
Well, what about Reggie?

15:35.436 --> 15:37.105
Well, he'll understand.
I'll explain it to him.

15:37.171 --> 15:40.174
What about the casino?
You guys are a team.

15:40.241 --> 15:42.143
He'll understand.
He wants me to be happy.

15:42.210 --> 15:46.647
I know that, Mom,
but what is he gonna do
without you?

15:46.714 --> 15:47.815
We'll figure it out.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.083
Are you ready to go?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.494
Jerry.

16:00.561 --> 16:01.562
Where are we?

16:01.629 --> 16:03.064
Ready to rock and roll.
Where have you been?

16:03.131 --> 16:04.498
I met with Rykoff.

16:04.565 --> 16:07.201
Cash we found in the Bentley
was a drop in the bucket.

16:07.268 --> 16:09.837
Tony Allen was
robbing his cousin blind.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.140
Veronica knew.
Nash, too.

16:12.206 --> 16:13.474
That's our motive.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.909
I get how Veronica
would know, but Nash?

16:16.044 --> 16:18.546
Are they in cahoots?

16:18.612 --> 16:19.880
They must be.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.415
We just gotta prove it.

16:23.051 --> 16:25.919
I can't see how you
make that jump.

16:26.054 --> 16:27.321
My gut.

16:27.388 --> 16:29.057
Yeah, Coniff or
Espinosa around?

16:29.090 --> 16:30.158
Harry, you sure
you want to do that?

16:30.224 --> 16:32.893
Told 'em we'd cooperate.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.095
Yeah.

16:34.162 --> 16:36.230
Yeah, meet us at
Nash's house in an hour.

16:36.297 --> 16:38.532
We'll be there in 45.

16:38.599 --> 16:40.501
No way.

16:41.069 --> 16:43.071
Let's go.

16:45.106 --> 16:47.941
How'd they beat us here?

16:48.076 --> 16:49.877
We need to take
the master bedroom.

16:49.943 --> 16:50.978
- We do?
- Yeah, we do.

16:51.079 --> 16:53.247
- Why?
- Just trust me.

17:02.090 --> 17:05.326
LAPD. Search warrant.
Open the door.

17:05.393 --> 17:07.095
You're always good with
the bottom of your boot.

17:07.161 --> 17:08.329
Have at it.

17:15.569 --> 17:18.106
You guys hold the front.
We'll take the back.

17:19.273 --> 17:21.109
Clear?

17:21.109 --> 17:22.476
Clear.

17:26.114 --> 17:28.849
Oh, shit.

17:28.916 --> 17:29.950
Might need to drill this.

17:30.017 --> 17:31.119
Careful.

17:31.185 --> 17:32.153
Why, you think it's
booby trapped?

17:32.220 --> 17:33.487
- Could be.
- Uh-uh.

17:33.554 --> 17:36.124
You've been watching
too many cartel movies.

17:36.190 --> 17:39.427
Uh-huh.
Look at that.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.670
Clear.

17:49.737 --> 17:53.006
Shit shoes.
Brother's not into
quality footwear.

17:53.141 --> 17:55.309
Go outside and
start the photos.

18:12.593 --> 18:16.364
Coniff and Espinosa
found a gun safe, empty.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.566
We're too late.
He's in the wind.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.536
Harry, what the fuck's
going on here?

18:22.603 --> 18:24.638
What was supposed to
be here, partner?

18:42.423 --> 18:43.924
Nash was casing Allen.

18:43.991 --> 18:45.459
Yeah.

18:45.526 --> 18:47.761
That's how he knew
about the money.

18:51.232 --> 18:54.435
And Veronica
had him killed.

18:54.502 --> 18:57.205
Photos would have
helped to prove this.

18:57.271 --> 18:59.039
These are inadmissible.

18:59.106 --> 19:01.909
No shit.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.211
Who's this?

19:07.114 --> 19:08.282
Irving.

19:09.417 --> 19:12.119
- You did this with Irving?
- Yeah.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.455
What the fuck, Harry?

19:14.522 --> 19:17.958
What's he
got to do with this?

19:18.025 --> 19:19.293
The cases are connected.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.362
George was part of
Nash's crew.

19:21.429 --> 19:22.863
They figured out
he was undercover.

19:22.930 --> 19:26.300
And you guys were running
your own investigation.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.069
- Yep.
- Shit, Harry.
What the fuck?

19:29.136 --> 19:30.103
You should have told me.

19:30.238 --> 19:32.039
I couldn't. Sorry.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.007
Shit, I'm pissed.

19:34.074 --> 19:35.509
I'm fuckin' pissed.

19:42.115 --> 19:43.917
I'll get over it.

19:43.984 --> 19:45.653
I'm counting on that.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.790
So you were supposed to
legit find these photos,

19:49.857 --> 19:52.360
and get everything
back on the up and up.

19:52.426 --> 19:53.961
Photos would have
made the case.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.843
You have to go
back to work?

20:09.910 --> 20:10.878
Nope.

20:15.182 --> 20:16.550
Thanks for
making dinner.

20:18.118 --> 20:19.953
Kind of like old times.

20:20.020 --> 20:20.888
It was passable.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.456
Better than that.

20:22.523 --> 20:25.959
So how's our girl?
She was a bit glum
at dinner.

20:27.295 --> 20:29.162
She's okay.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.464
She's just
missing her friends.

20:30.531 --> 20:32.300
She's probably in there
Skyping now.

20:32.366 --> 20:34.635
Oh, I know I can't
keep you here forever.

20:34.702 --> 20:36.937
You gotta go home
sooner or later.

20:37.004 --> 20:38.205
We do.

20:38.272 --> 20:40.207
You still think
we might be in danger?

20:40.274 --> 20:42.175
Probably not.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.644
But I'd worry anyway.

20:43.711 --> 20:46.113
As long as Reggie's away,
why not stay here?

20:46.179 --> 20:47.348
We'll see.

20:51.018 --> 20:52.152
I saw Griffin today.

20:52.219 --> 20:54.755
Oh, yeah?
What'd he have to say?

20:54.822 --> 20:56.757
They're taking the flag
off my record.

20:56.824 --> 20:57.791
That's great.

20:57.858 --> 20:59.693
And he gave me a
letter of recommendation,

20:59.760 --> 21:01.329
signed by the
director himself.

21:01.329 --> 21:03.997
As well they should.
Congrats.

21:04.064 --> 21:05.032
You tell Maddie?

21:05.098 --> 21:06.334
I showed her the letter.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.001
Yeah?
What'd she say?

21:08.068 --> 21:09.570
She's happy for me.

21:09.637 --> 21:12.239
She's also
a little confused.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.141
She's not really sure
what her mother's up to.

21:15.776 --> 21:19.347
Her mother's
not really sure, either.

21:19.347 --> 21:22.350
But I am really excited

21:22.350 --> 21:24.352
for the first time
in a long time.

21:25.486 --> 21:27.455
I want to thank you
for that.

21:29.156 --> 21:30.491
Glad I could help.

21:30.558 --> 21:33.927
Glad the Bureau
did right by you.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.396
I saw Rykoff today.

21:35.463 --> 21:36.664
He said they found
their agent.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.098
Yeah, that's what
Griffin said.

21:38.165 --> 21:41.068
Well, at least the family
will now have some closure.

21:47.408 --> 21:48.709
What about Reggie?

21:48.776 --> 21:52.245
Have you told him
about any of this?

21:52.380 --> 21:54.382
We've been
exchanging emails.

21:54.382 --> 21:55.549
Easier with
the time difference.

21:55.616 --> 21:57.585
I didn't know you'd
been in contact.

21:57.651 --> 22:00.488
He's coming back home
next week.

22:00.554 --> 22:03.023
So I figured I'd wait and
tell him when he gets back.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.408
I thought you already
arrested someone.

22:20.408 --> 22:22.410
He wasn't the guy.
They let him go.

22:22.476 --> 22:24.412
Do you have a suspect?

22:24.478 --> 22:25.613
We're following
some leads.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.180
We came up here
to talk to Carl Nash,

22:27.247 --> 22:28.582
but he's not
at work today.

22:28.649 --> 22:30.718
Why on earth would you
want to speak to him?

22:30.784 --> 22:34.287
He's become
a person of interest
in this case.

22:34.422 --> 22:35.423
I can't imagine why.

22:35.423 --> 22:37.425
How well do you
know him?

22:37.425 --> 22:38.626
To say hello to.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.027
Not that you'd
know this,

22:40.093 --> 22:42.262
but he's got quite
a checkered past.

22:42.329 --> 22:43.431
Really?

22:43.497 --> 22:45.433
He was forced to resign
from the LAPD.

22:45.499 --> 22:47.501
Corruption,
brutality.

22:47.568 --> 22:48.902
I had no idea.

22:48.969 --> 22:51.038
He seems so harmless,
like a big teddy bear.

22:51.104 --> 22:53.441
Hidden Highlands
should have run a better
background check.

22:53.507 --> 22:54.808
They certainly
should have.

22:54.875 --> 22:55.609
If you see him.

22:55.676 --> 22:57.445
Oh, I have one,
thank you.

22:57.445 --> 22:58.579
Right.
Give us a call.

22:58.646 --> 22:59.747
We really need to
talk to him.

22:59.813 --> 23:02.315
He may look harmless,
but believe me,

23:02.450 --> 23:04.084
he has a very
violent history.

23:06.454 --> 23:08.922
My God,
you think Carl Nash
killed my husband.

23:08.989 --> 23:11.592
Put it this way.
He's high on our list.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.727
Thank you
for the warning.

23:13.794 --> 23:15.162
- You're welcome.
- Stay safe.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.464
I will.

23:28.308 --> 23:30.544
She doesn't strike me as
somebody who's gonna panic.

23:30.611 --> 23:31.645
Works in our favor.

23:31.712 --> 23:33.481
She won't risk
a digital trail.

23:33.514 --> 23:34.381
She makes contact
with Nash,

23:34.482 --> 23:35.749
she'll make it
in person.

23:35.816 --> 23:37.485
And the stakeout,
how's that working?

23:37.551 --> 23:40.253
Three shifts,
one way in, one way out.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.288
We got it covered.

23:41.354 --> 23:42.690
Love a gated community.

23:42.756 --> 23:45.092
Yes, I'd like to
place an order for delivery.

23:46.794 --> 23:49.162
And great.
How long will that take?

23:49.229 --> 23:50.698
That's perfect.

23:50.764 --> 23:54.101
You can charge it
to my account.

23:58.839 --> 24:00.541
- Bosch.
- Kiesha Russell.

24:00.608 --> 24:02.543
You have a minute,
Detective?

24:02.610 --> 24:04.277
Not if it's about
my mother's murder.

24:04.344 --> 24:06.413
It's about the case
against Luke Rykoff
getting kicked.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.281
You always work
on Sundays?

24:08.348 --> 24:09.750
Yeah, just like you,
Detective.

24:09.817 --> 24:12.252
Rykoff was released because
the warrant was bad.

24:12.319 --> 24:13.386
Even though
Las Vegas Metro

24:13.521 --> 24:14.922
found the murder weapon
in his home?

24:14.988 --> 24:17.525
Gun was excluded.
I've got work to do.

24:17.591 --> 24:18.759
Annette called me again.

24:18.826 --> 24:21.829
- Annette?
- I gave you her number.

24:23.531 --> 24:24.632
I've been busy.

24:24.698 --> 24:25.866
Your mother
told her a story

24:25.933 --> 24:28.068
a few days
before she died.

24:31.539 --> 24:32.773
Go ahead.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.642
She'd been to visit you
at the youth home.

24:34.708 --> 24:36.243
She was upset because

24:36.309 --> 24:38.278
someone had stolen
the red sneakers
she'd given you,

24:38.345 --> 24:42.616
and that the thief
had beaten you badly
and you'd been blamed.

24:44.685 --> 24:47.220
True story,
Detective?

24:47.287 --> 24:49.256
I got detention
for fighting.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.959
She told Annette that
it broke her heart to
see you like that.

24:52.025 --> 24:54.294
And that she was
more determined than ever
to bring you home,

24:54.361 --> 24:55.863
but that before
she could do that--

24:55.929 --> 24:57.665
Have a good day,
Miss Russell.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.422
You're kidding me.

25:30.497 --> 25:32.766
Connie.

25:32.833 --> 25:35.803
You need to call
before you come over.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.238
You changed the locks.

26:11.504 --> 26:12.472
Help you?

26:12.539 --> 26:15.643
Delivery for
a V. Allen.

26:20.814 --> 26:24.417
Mrs. Allen.
Are you expecting
a delivery?

26:24.484 --> 26:25.653
Go on up.

26:48.809 --> 26:49.777
Look alive, partner.

26:49.843 --> 26:51.478
Court services alert.

26:51.544 --> 26:52.680
What is it?

26:52.713 --> 26:54.081
The judge from
the Allen probate case

26:54.147 --> 26:56.316
just issued letters
of administration
to Veronica.

26:56.383 --> 26:57.751
Is that what she's
been waiting for?

26:57.818 --> 26:59.119
They give her authority
to inventory

26:59.186 --> 27:00.721
all of Tony Allen's
bank accounts.

27:00.788 --> 27:02.522
Six different banks.

27:02.589 --> 27:03.691
Addresses?

27:03.724 --> 27:05.693
Names, addresses,
the whole magilla.

27:05.693 --> 27:07.360
Give me the addresses.

27:07.427 --> 27:09.196
Just the addresses?

27:09.262 --> 27:09.997
Yeah, go.

27:10.063 --> 27:11.899
- 864--
- Next one.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.500
You don't even want
the street?

27:13.566 --> 27:14.768
No, just the numbers.

27:14.835 --> 27:16.536
- 225.
- Next one.

27:16.603 --> 27:17.905
- 160.
- That's it.

27:17.971 --> 27:20.573
- That's what?
- That's where the money is.

27:20.708 --> 27:22.710
The addresses match.
What's the street?

27:22.776 --> 27:25.545
160 San Fernando Rd.,
Sylmar.

27:25.612 --> 27:26.914
First National
Pacific Bank.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.515
Tony had a
safe deposit box here.

27:28.581 --> 27:29.883
It's gonna be
a big ass one

27:29.950 --> 27:31.451
- to hold 4 million bucks.
- Yeah.

27:31.518 --> 27:32.720
Does it say if
Veronica Allen

27:32.720 --> 27:34.121
was in court
for the proceeding?

27:34.187 --> 27:36.724
Just a digital notice.
It doesn't say who was there.

27:36.757 --> 27:37.725
When did that happen?

27:37.791 --> 27:38.892
An hour ago
this morning.

27:38.959 --> 27:40.728
Fuck.
Let's check it out.

27:52.773 --> 27:55.743
Veronica Allen.
Is she home?

27:55.776 --> 27:57.010
Yes, sir.
Hasn't left.

27:57.077 --> 27:58.746
We need to speak to her.
Please call her.

28:08.488 --> 28:09.456
No answer.

28:13.761 --> 28:15.428
Give me the clipboard.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.598
Fuck! She got
a delivery last night.

28:18.665 --> 28:20.400
Pull up her driveway
on the screen.

28:20.467 --> 28:22.870
- We're not allowed to--
- This is a homicide
investigation.

28:22.936 --> 28:24.905
Do you understand?
Do it now.

28:28.441 --> 28:31.511
Run it back to
the delivery last night, 8:10.

28:31.578 --> 28:32.780
Okay.

28:39.386 --> 28:40.153
Oh, man.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.789
She's pulling
a number on him.

28:50.898 --> 28:54.001
One of those is
a lot lighter
than the other.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.103
Son of a bitch,
she's gone.

29:56.429 --> 29:57.397
She's here.

30:01.701 --> 30:02.870
Yeah, we got her.

30:11.678 --> 30:13.146
Thanks.

30:18.818 --> 30:19.953
- Bosch.
- Bosch, we have a problem.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.354
Chief, I can't
talk right now.

30:21.421 --> 30:23.723
- O'Grady slipped her tail.
- When?

30:23.790 --> 30:24.724
Last night.
Where are you?

30:25.792 --> 30:27.294
Heading to a bank
in Sylmar.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.828
We think Veronica Allen
may be collecting that
pot of gold,

30:28.896 --> 30:30.697
hopefully
lead us to Nash.

30:30.763 --> 30:33.100
- Well, let me know
what happens.
-I will.

30:33.934 --> 30:34.968
Veronica
may have company.

30:35.035 --> 30:36.669
- Who?
- Nash and his crew.

30:36.736 --> 30:39.672
So Veronica and Nash.
They working together
or against each other?

30:39.739 --> 30:40.908
We'll find out.

30:41.441 --> 30:42.375
Mrs. Allen,

30:42.442 --> 30:43.810
the locksmith
your attorney arranged for

30:43.877 --> 30:44.978
is right here,

30:45.045 --> 30:46.313
and it should only take
a few minutes

30:46.379 --> 30:48.882
- to get that box open.
- Thank you.

31:00.227 --> 31:03.096
Have Wash bring
the car around. Now.

31:41.401 --> 31:42.970
Okay, look sharp.
We got a bogey.

31:43.003 --> 31:43.971
Yeah, who is he?

31:43.971 --> 31:45.638
Vegas, one of
Marks' crew.

31:45.705 --> 31:46.673
Fuck.

31:58.585 --> 31:59.987
May I help you?

31:59.987 --> 32:01.621
Yeah. How do I
open an account?

32:01.688 --> 32:04.791
I just need you to start by
filling out a few documents.

32:04.857 --> 32:06.026
All right.

32:07.995 --> 32:09.362
I'll be right outside,

32:09.429 --> 32:11.064
so just let me know
when you're finished,

32:11.131 --> 32:12.265
and I'll put
the box away.

32:12.332 --> 32:14.201
Thank you.
That's very kind.

32:46.499 --> 32:48.668
Whoa, what happened?
Someone break the safe?

32:48.735 --> 32:51.738
Oh, no,
we just had to drill
a safe deposit box.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.173
Probate proceeding.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.775
Now, what type of account
would you like to open?

32:55.842 --> 32:56.943
You know what?

32:57.044 --> 32:58.111
I forgot
my fuckin' wallet.

32:58.178 --> 32:59.679
I'm gonna have to
do this next time.

33:10.290 --> 33:12.092
I didn't see her inside.

33:12.159 --> 33:14.161
And someone just drilled out
a box inside the vault.

33:14.227 --> 33:15.962
They said it's
probate stuff.

33:16.063 --> 33:18.865
It's her.
We wait.

33:18.931 --> 33:20.100
All right.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.971
So what's the plan now?
We bail?

33:25.072 --> 33:27.074
Fuck that.
This is our go money.

33:27.107 --> 33:29.076
We're not leaving it.

33:29.109 --> 33:30.977
You have badges,
they don't.

33:31.078 --> 33:32.579
We play this out.

33:32.645 --> 33:33.613
Roger that.

34:05.745 --> 34:07.114
Go.

34:34.641 --> 34:38.211
You know what?
You want it, take it.

34:38.278 --> 34:39.546
Mr. Marks wants
a word with you.

34:39.612 --> 34:41.148
Yeah, well,
I don't want
a word with him.

34:41.214 --> 34:42.282
Don't think of
running, lady.

34:42.349 --> 34:43.716
I'll take you down.

34:48.688 --> 34:50.957
Madam.

34:51.023 --> 34:52.725
Please get in the car.

34:52.792 --> 34:53.993
Veronica.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.328
Please.

34:55.395 --> 34:56.996
I'm not going to
hurt you.

34:57.063 --> 34:58.465
I just want to talk.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.233
Let's work this out
together.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.501
There's nothing
to talk about.

35:01.568 --> 35:03.736
The suitcase is yours.
Take it.

35:03.803 --> 35:05.305
Get in the car.

35:05.372 --> 35:07.974
Shit. Go now!
Go, go, go!

35:14.514 --> 35:16.048
Police!
On the ground!

35:16.183 --> 35:17.083
Everybody on the ground!

35:17.184 --> 35:18.651
Get down now!
Everybody down!

35:18.718 --> 35:20.920
This is a rip off.
They work with Nash.

35:20.987 --> 35:22.189
They killed Tony.

35:22.222 --> 35:23.356
Fuck you!

35:23.423 --> 35:25.024
Put down the weapon,
nobody gets hurt.

35:25.091 --> 35:26.193
Put it the fuck down!

35:26.193 --> 35:27.727
You want it
come take it.

35:27.794 --> 35:29.196
Billy! Don't.

35:30.062 --> 35:31.898
O'Grady,
get in there now! Go!

35:50.683 --> 35:52.785
Holy shit, that's them.
That's Marks' crew.

35:52.852 --> 35:54.221
How'd they know
about this?

35:54.287 --> 35:55.922
Same way we did.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.224
Call back up.

36:01.694 --> 36:03.496
Six-William-23,
2-11 in progress

36:03.563 --> 36:05.832
in the parking lot of
First National Pacific
Bank Plaza,

36:05.898 --> 36:09.236
160 San Fernando Rd.
Suspect is armed and
dangerous.

36:09.269 --> 36:10.970
Possible
hostage situation.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.972
It's Detective Edgar,
sir.

36:13.039 --> 36:14.006
Go faster.

36:15.141 --> 36:16.243
Last chance!

36:16.309 --> 36:17.577
We don't give a shit
about her.

36:17.644 --> 36:20.112
You want to live,
put the weapon down.

36:32.158 --> 36:33.159
Get down!

36:33.260 --> 36:35.094
Get down!

36:43.270 --> 36:44.103
Up!

36:44.170 --> 36:45.104
Up!

37:00.320 --> 37:01.688
Ahh!

37:28.348 --> 37:30.116
What the fuck?

37:30.182 --> 37:31.318
You bitch.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.031
Stand up!

37:47.133 --> 37:48.868
Oh!

37:51.137 --> 37:52.505
Get back!
You stay back!

37:54.341 --> 37:57.344
Get down! Get the fuck down.
Get down.

37:59.346 --> 38:01.348
Stay back!

38:10.357 --> 38:12.725
- Stop the van.
Stop the van!

38:12.792 --> 38:14.093
Slide over.
Slide over.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.362
Slide over,
slide over,

38:15.362 --> 38:17.163
slide over, slide over,
slide over now!

38:17.229 --> 38:19.466
- Open the door,
open the door.
- Okay, okay, okay.

38:19.532 --> 38:22.068
Open the door.
Slide over.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.578
Six-William-23,
187 suspect fleeing
westbound,

38:31.644 --> 38:32.645
- San Fernando Rd.
- Fuck! Fuck!

38:32.712 --> 38:34.381
Suspect possibly wounded
in OIS.

38:34.447 --> 38:36.248
Has a hostage and he's
armed and dangerous.

38:58.405 --> 39:00.440
Got a live one here.

39:09.482 --> 39:10.483
Get up.

39:10.550 --> 39:12.251
I'm a cop,
goddammit.

39:12.318 --> 39:13.453
You were a cop.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.522
Now you're fuckin'
under arrest.

39:18.257 --> 39:19.426
Get her an R.A.

39:31.070 --> 39:33.139
Are you hurt?

39:33.205 --> 39:34.441
No.

39:39.712 --> 39:42.549
What the fuck
are you doing?

39:42.615 --> 39:44.183
Call it
protective custody.

39:46.486 --> 39:48.054
Officer, take her back
to the station,

39:48.120 --> 39:49.456
put her in a room.

39:49.489 --> 39:51.558
You can't do this.
I didn't do anything wrong.

39:51.624 --> 39:53.159
I'm the victim here.

40:05.705 --> 40:07.474
Where's the money?

40:32.699 --> 40:33.933
Give me them napkins.
Give me some--

40:34.000 --> 40:36.102
On the floor there,
hand me those napkins.

40:36.168 --> 40:38.370
That's right.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.772
Oh, God.

40:39.839 --> 40:41.774
Give me some more,
give me some more.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.879
Ohh.

41:26.619 --> 41:29.288
Jesus Christ, Bosch.

41:29.355 --> 41:30.623
What the fuck happened?

41:39.365 --> 41:42.569
**
