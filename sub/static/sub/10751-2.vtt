00:38.580 --> 00:40.698
Is this your stapler, Roy?

00:40.708 --> 00:41.741
No.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.367
No, it's not.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.711
I used it for one thing.

00:44.721 --> 00:45.923
How many staples did you use?

00:45.963 --> 00:47.121
Six or seven.

00:48.748 --> 00:52.502
One, two, three, four...

00:52.512 --> 00:54.420
five, six... Is that seven?

00:54.438 --> 00:56.040
Why do you need to know?

00:56.051 --> 00:59.215
I just do.
I need to know, you know I need to know,

00:59.224 --> 01:02.671
and you never count how
many staples you've used.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.800
Eight, nine...
Oh, gonna have to do it in fives.

01:05.819 --> 01:09.013
Five, 10, 15... Is that 20?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.430
There you go, Moss.

01:10.447 --> 01:14.190
Awright, 'arry?
See that ludicrous display last night?

01:14.205 --> 01:16.943
What was Wenger thinking,
sending Walcott on that early?

01:16.955 --> 01:19.982
Fing about Arsenal is,
they always try an' walk it in.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.153
True. See you later, Moss.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.821
Mind 'ow you go.

01:26.957 --> 01:28.070
What was that?

01:28.086 --> 01:28.912
What?

01:28.927 --> 01:32.040
You were saying football things,
in a football voice!

01:32.058 --> 01:34.500
Oh, it's this new site.
It sends you a list

01:34.515 --> 01:37.041
of football phrases that you
can use in normal conversation,

01:37.057 --> 01:38.711
updated daily. It's great.

01:38.726 --> 01:41.632
I only use it so I can say
something to the postman.

01:41.648 --> 01:43.590
It's got a pronunciation
guide, or..

01:44.098 --> 01:46.091
pronunciation guide.

01:51.018 --> 01:54.023
You can get it sent to your phone,
so that even when I'm away

01:54.037 --> 01:57.190
from my desk I can still sound
like I'm just a big, normal man.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.442
45, 50...

01:59.455 --> 02:01.690
Oh, hey, Moss,
send me a link for that, will you?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.281
Right, I'm off.

02:03.295 --> 02:03.943
Bit early!

02:03.958 --> 02:04.991
Got a date.

02:05.008 --> 02:07.493
Oh, right, with Michael?

02:07.506 --> 02:08.163
That's right.

02:08.176 --> 02:09.570
Looks like a magician?

02:09.588 --> 02:10.531
Yeah.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.623
What?

02:18.637 --> 02:19.880
He looks like a what?

02:19.896 --> 02:22.750
This is Michael, right?
The guy that came in last week?

02:22.767 --> 02:24.460
He doesn't look
like a magician.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.843
Yeah, he does.
He does, doesn't he, Moss?

02:27.858 --> 02:28.471
Hmm?

02:28.488 --> 02:30.551
The guy that came
in looking for Jen?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.602
Ah, Michael the Magnificent.

02:33.857 --> 02:35.642
He doesn't look
like a magician.

02:35.657 --> 02:36.850
He does.

02:36.866 --> 02:37.891
He doesn't.

02:37.905 --> 02:39.022
He massively does.

02:39.038 --> 02:40.153
He does, Jen.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.233
Oh, shut up.

02:51.498 --> 02:53.412
It's a lovely restaurant.

02:53.428 --> 02:56.251
Isn't it?
One of my favourites, actually.

02:56.267 --> 02:59.832
One of the silly things I love about
this restaurant, have you had a look

02:59.848 --> 03:02.753
at these salt and pepper pots,
they're really beautiful.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.883
There's something about the shape,
and I'm probably a bit of

03:05.895 --> 03:08.220
a design freak but it's
a kind of beautiful...

03:20.566 --> 03:23.521
What are they saying that
could possibly be that funny?

03:23.537 --> 03:26.653
I'm funny, why can't I be
over there making them laugh?

03:26.668 --> 03:30.280
They're proper men, Roy.

03:30.295 --> 03:32.070
We're men. We're proper men.

03:32.085 --> 03:34.032
What's so different about us?

03:36.335 --> 03:38.581
Seven, 14,

03:38.598 --> 03:42.502
51, 35, 42,

03:42.516 --> 03:46.923
49, 35...

03:46.938 --> 03:47.841
Seven...

03:47.857 --> 03:51.430
'Did you see
that ludicrous display last night?'

03:53.097 --> 03:56.012
..21, 28...

04:17.584 --> 04:19.000
Oh, referee - oh...

04:21.045 --> 04:23.880
Did you see that ludicrous
display last night?

04:23.896 --> 04:26.713
What's Wenger doing sending
Walcott on that early?

04:26.725 --> 04:30.550
The thing about Arsenal is they
always try and walk it in.

04:30.568 --> 04:32.432
Exactly. Dan.

04:32.445 --> 04:33.430
Roy.

04:33.447 --> 04:36.141
But Chelsea, on the other hand,
I like them suddenly.

04:38.765 --> 04:39.770
Yeah.

04:42.276 --> 04:45.031
Chelsea?
You're having a laugh int'ya?

04:45.045 --> 04:46.370
I'll put money in
it if you like?

04:46.418 --> 04:48.522
Nah, I've already got
a pony on Liverpool,

04:48.537 --> 04:50.360
so I probably won't
see that again.

04:52.828 --> 04:54.571
Dan, Moss. Moss, Dan.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.621
Nice to meet you, son.
Want a drink, boys?

04:56.636 --> 04:58.160
We'll get this.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.410
Nah, it's on me.
Whatever these boys are having.

05:00.428 --> 05:00.861
Here he is.

05:03.166 --> 05:07.212
Roy, Moss, Derek, Luke. Moss here
fancies Liverpool for the weekend.

05:07.227 --> 05:11.051
Liverpool? You're
having a laugh int'ya?

05:11.068 --> 05:12.260
He's put a pony on it!

05:12.277 --> 05:13.091
A pony?

05:13.106 --> 05:14.683
Yeah, I know. Tell Barry!

05:14.698 --> 05:16.012
Tell me what?

05:16.027 --> 05:17.510
He's only put a
pony on Liverpool.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.470
You lunatic, eh?

05:51.926 --> 05:53.303
So, who do you support?

05:55.387 --> 05:56.682
Who do I support?

05:56.696 --> 05:58.143
Yeah.

06:00.648 --> 06:02.182
West Ham.

06:05.068 --> 06:07.350
Did you say West Ham?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.233
Is that all right?

06:09.246 --> 06:11.271
All right?

06:11.286 --> 06:13.730
What does that look like?
A birthmark?

06:18.035 --> 06:18.992
Look on his face!

06:20.076 --> 06:21.533
Look on my face!

06:24.127 --> 06:26.412
Roy, can I have a natter with you?

06:26.428 --> 06:30.962
It's about private man's business.
I'm sure you boys will understand.

06:30.976 --> 06:32.671
Excuse me, please.

06:35.266 --> 06:37.382
I'm a little bit scared,
and I want to leave.

06:37.396 --> 06:37.931
What?

06:37.948 --> 06:41.050
We're in too deep, Roy.
I'm worried they're going to find out

06:41.065 --> 06:43.101
I don't know what a pony is.
We should go.

06:43.117 --> 06:45.433
I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't paid for a drink

06:45.447 --> 06:48.772
all night, and besides, once you
get over the whole football thing,

06:48.785 --> 06:51.193
they're actually surprisingly
easy to talk to.

06:51.308 --> 06:52.823
Maybe we're proper men!

06:52.838 --> 06:55.360
Look, we're messing with
stuff we don't understand.

06:55.378 --> 06:57.033
We're through the
looking glass.

06:57.045 --> 06:59.323
Just promise me you will
not let this get too far.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.072
I promise.

07:08.758 --> 07:11.333
Hooray. He's kicked the ball.

07:11.346 --> 07:14.171
Now the ball's over there.

07:14.186 --> 07:15.843
That man has it now.

07:15.858 --> 07:18.421
That's an
interesting development.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.642
Maybe he'll kick the ball.

07:20.656 --> 07:24.853
He has indeed and apparently that
deserves a round of applause.

07:24.865 --> 07:26.313
Will you shut up!

07:26.325 --> 07:27.850
This is the worst
thing in the world.

07:27.867 --> 07:28.942
What could I do?

07:28.957 --> 07:31.562
He bought the tickets on the
phone when we were in the pub.

07:31.578 --> 07:33.061
I could hardly say no, could I?

07:33.077 --> 07:34.232
Can I use this?

07:35.278 --> 07:36.732
I don't know.

07:41.415 --> 07:44.083
Oh, they're singing!
Maybe we should!

07:44.096 --> 07:46.792
Just promise me we won't do
anything else with them,

07:46.805 --> 07:48.622
I want to go back
to being weird.

07:48.636 --> 07:52.331
I like being weird, weird's all
I've got. That and my sweet style.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.500
OK, look here, we'll make our
excuses when the match is over.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.340
How long do football
matches last?

07:57.355 --> 07:59.470
A billion hours apparently.

07:59.487 --> 08:01.430
Gonna play poker tonight,
you game?

08:01.441 --> 08:03.435
I'm in.

08:03.444 --> 08:05.261
Moss?

08:05.278 --> 08:06.600
I won't Dan, no.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.222
Come on.

08:07.238 --> 08:09.601
No, no can do.
I'm seein' a bird.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.853
Oh, really?

08:10.867 --> 08:12.480
Yeah, why not.

08:12.496 --> 08:13.730
What's she like?

08:13.747 --> 08:17.363
Well, she's, er, not much to look
at but she is very kind 'arted.

08:17.376 --> 08:19.862
So as I say,
I've gotta vamoosh.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.402
What, you're not watching it?

08:21.415 --> 08:22.860
They're 'aving a larf today.

08:22.875 --> 08:23.911
We're winning.

08:23.928 --> 08:26.533
No, they're having a larf.

08:39.808 --> 08:40.881
Morning.

08:40.895 --> 08:45.763
Oh, my word. When did the
English start drinking like that?

08:45.776 --> 08:48.063
You people drink like
you don't want to live.

08:48.076 --> 08:50.023
We do love to binge.

08:50.038 --> 08:51.391
What happened to you?

08:51.407 --> 08:53.103
I've got Cockney neck,

08:53.116 --> 08:56.732
I've been speaking too much Cockney
and it's done my blooming neck in.

08:56.747 --> 08:58.650
< Oh, here she is.

08:58.667 --> 09:01.030
Debbie McGee.

09:01.046 --> 09:03.820
Morning, all.
I'm off to break up with him.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.781
What's wrong with you two?

09:06.795 --> 09:09.562
We've been hanging
out with men.

09:09.575 --> 09:10.923
Why are you breaking
up with him?

09:10.966 --> 09:12.411
Why? What do you mean why?

09:12.426 --> 09:14.833
Because he looks
like a magician.

09:14.848 --> 09:15.962
Doesn't he, though?

09:15.977 --> 09:17.590
Oh, he totally does.

09:17.606 --> 09:20.052
And ever since you two said
it I haven't been able

09:20.067 --> 09:22.382
to get it out of my head.
So thanks, thanks a lot.

09:22.397 --> 09:24.050
Another one bites the dust.

09:24.066 --> 09:25.840
You're not breaking
up cos of that?!

09:25.856 --> 09:29.562
I can't be seen
with that...mentalist.

09:29.575 --> 09:31.392
Do you know what he
does for a living?

09:31.406 --> 09:32.682
He is a driving instructor.

09:34.277 --> 09:39.150
A driving instructor who looks like
a magician. It's preposterous.

09:39.168 --> 09:41.821
That's almost the worst look a
driving instructor could have.

09:41.837 --> 09:43.443
So distracting.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.200
Only clown would be worse.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.952
Mmmm. Or mountie.

09:50.418 --> 09:53.123
So, how was your night
of poker with the boys?

09:53.138 --> 09:54.963
Yeah, good, good.

09:54.977 --> 09:57.961
I mean, I didn't...
I wasn't brilliant at the start because,

09:57.977 --> 09:59.593
you know,
I was mostly vomiting.

09:59.605 --> 10:00.751
Lovely.

10:00.768 --> 10:05.132
But then I knuckled down and
I brought my "A" game and, er,

10:05.145 --> 10:06.803
things got a lot better.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.343
That's good,
how much did you win?

10:08.356 --> 10:13.432
Er, no, no, I lost £200.
But it's less than I usually lose, so...

10:13.447 --> 10:15.431
Still, £200 though.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.192
Mm, but listen to this,
Dan let me off.

10:18.206 --> 10:21.113
He just totally let me off.
Proper men are so cool.

10:21.128 --> 10:23.071
They just don't
care about money.

10:24.947 --> 10:26.323
Hello.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.202
Where's my fackin' money?

10:29.216 --> 10:30.992
I want that money,
give me my money.

10:31.008 --> 10:32.912
Oh, really?

10:32.926 --> 10:35.543
I'm only joking,
you muppet. Ha-ha!

10:35.556 --> 10:39.463
Oh!
You're funny.

10:39.475 --> 10:40.542
'Oi, listen,'

10:40.555 --> 10:44.012
a friend of mine's let me down.
Can you meet me at lunch?

10:44.025 --> 10:45.722
Yeah, OK, OK.

10:47.526 --> 10:48.970
What's your address?

11:01.747 --> 11:03.541
Here he is. Hiya, Dan.

11:03.557 --> 11:05.293
You got here.

11:05.308 --> 11:06.580
Oi-oi, boys.

11:06.596 --> 11:09.082
All right, mate.
All right? You all right?

11:09.097 --> 11:11.091
Yeah, er, pretty good.

11:11.105 --> 11:13.323
Oh, hey,
sorry again about last night.

11:13.337 --> 11:14.932
Nah, don't mention it.
Listen, that favour,

11:14.976 --> 11:17.671
you wouldn't be available to do
a little taxi job would you?

11:17.687 --> 11:19.181
You want me to drive?

11:19.195 --> 11:20.842
This?

11:20.855 --> 11:22.511
Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.

11:22.528 --> 11:25.432
I wouldn't bother you with this,
but someone's let me down.

11:25.446 --> 11:26.980
It should only take
a couple of hours.

11:26.997 --> 11:29.403
It's no problem.
Oh, is it an automatic?

11:29.418 --> 11:32.313
Cos I can only drive an automatic.
Oh, it is an automatic.

11:33.886 --> 11:36.710
I'm your man. Oh, and you're sure
that everything with the money is OK?

11:36.755 --> 11:38.783
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This makes us totally quits.

11:38.795 --> 11:41.740
You, sir, are a gentlemen.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.583
This guy, huh?

11:52.847 --> 11:55.963
Here we go.
Pull over here, Roy.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.381
OK.

12:00.888 --> 12:04.182
"You have reached
your destination."

12:04.197 --> 12:05.760
All right, everyone.

12:05.777 --> 12:08.101
Take your time.

12:10.195 --> 12:12.350
Oh, hey,
how do you get the radio to work?

12:12.367 --> 12:14.152
Ah, I've got it, got it.

12:15.695 --> 12:17.112
Oh, I love this one.

12:24.916 --> 12:27.630
- Yeah?
- Hey, man. All right?

12:27.648 --> 12:29.262
Hey, do you want to
meet up after this?

12:29.307 --> 12:31.621
Yeah, nothing's happening here.

12:31.635 --> 12:36.962
The guys have this, er, lockup down
by the gas works on Newcombe Road.

12:36.975 --> 12:41.220
The gas works? Is there anything
about them that's not manly?

12:41.235 --> 12:43.640
Jesus! Moss!

12:43.658 --> 12:44.972
Jesus Christ!

12:44.986 --> 12:46.291
What? What is it?

12:46.367 --> 12:48.023
There's a robbery!

12:48.037 --> 12:49.731
Across the road, right here.

12:49.745 --> 12:54.351
There's a robbery.
There's some blokes in balaclavas.

12:54.367 --> 12:56.901
Wow! They're,
they're totally robbing this place.

12:56.918 --> 12:58.401
Call the police,
call the police.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.362
Yeah, bye.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.162
Police, please.

13:07.178 --> 13:11.290
Yeah, hi, I'm on Denbury
Road and there is a robbery

13:11.307 --> 13:13.291
taking place right now.

13:13.305 --> 13:18.171
Three men, indiscriminate race,
balaclavas, big guns.

13:18.186 --> 13:20.262
Yeah, OK...

13:20.278 --> 13:22.302
Oh, my God, they're coming out.

13:22.318 --> 13:24.762
They're coming out,
OK, they're coming out.

13:24.777 --> 13:27.890
They're running towards us.
They're running towards the car.

13:27.905 --> 13:29.183
They're getting...

13:30.316 --> 13:32.431
DRIVE!

13:32.445 --> 13:33.893
Okey-dokey.

13:43.536 --> 13:44.740
Straight ahead. OK.

13:44.755 --> 13:47.530
Yeah, go on, keep going, mate.

13:47.548 --> 13:50.793
Right, swing a left here.

13:50.805 --> 13:53.750
Right, drive up
those ramps there.

13:53.765 --> 13:56.381
Right, drive up the
ramps into the truck.

13:56.395 --> 13:57.331
Come on, Roy, quickly!

13:57.348 --> 13:58.841
Yep, okey-doke.

14:01.886 --> 14:03.633
Come on!

14:03.645 --> 14:06.471
I'm climbing onto the truck.
Am I on it? Am I on it? I can't see.

14:06.488 --> 14:09.472
Oh, no!
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:09.486 --> 14:12.022
What's the matter with you?

14:12.038 --> 14:13.180
Get driving, man!

14:13.196 --> 14:15.522
Just get it up!

14:18.028 --> 14:23.321
Up, up, up,
up we go into the truck.

14:47.188 --> 14:49.681
What's that? Is someone crying?

14:49.698 --> 14:51.101
No.

14:54.356 --> 14:58.352
Did you see that ludicrous
display last night?

15:01.368 --> 15:05.821
What was Wenger thinking
bringing Walcott on that early?

15:10.166 --> 15:15.951
The thing about Arsenal is,
they always try and walk it in.

15:21.005 --> 15:23.713
But why? I don't understand,

15:23.726 --> 15:26.171
I thought it was going so well.
Was it something I did?

15:26.187 --> 15:29.433
No, no. It's hard to explain.

15:29.446 --> 15:32.893
Tell me, Jen, for God's sake.
You owe me that much.

15:35.027 --> 15:37.813
You look like a
magician, Michael.

15:37.828 --> 15:39.522
All right?

15:39.536 --> 15:43.563
I'm sorry, but you do.
I didn't notice at first,

15:43.578 --> 15:46.863
but then someone mentioned it
and now I can't get it out of my head.

15:46.877 --> 15:48.362
But I'm not a magician.

15:48.376 --> 15:51.162
I know, that's why it's not
good that you look like one.

15:51.178 --> 15:53.742
Well, what is it,
exactly, about me?

15:55.875 --> 15:57.753
It's everything.

15:57.768 --> 16:01.131
There's nothing about you that
doesn't look like a magician.

16:01.147 --> 16:05.003
It's everything. Don't you see it?
Don't you wake up every morning

16:05.016 --> 16:08.130
and look in the mirror and think,
"Christ, I look like a magician!"?

16:08.148 --> 16:11.050
No. Well, you should.

16:11.068 --> 16:15.100
I would, if I was a weirdy,
beardy magiciany man.

16:15.118 --> 16:17.561
I'm just trying to
help you, Michael.

16:17.575 --> 16:20.232
So it's over because of that?

16:20.245 --> 16:23.150
I don't see any way past it.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.900
It's weird, it's weird for me.

16:25.916 --> 16:27.233
I'm sorry.

16:27.247 --> 16:31.283
No, wait.
Maybe we can think of something.

16:34.997 --> 16:38.751
What if I actually
learned some magic tricks?

16:38.766 --> 16:41.621
- What do you mean?
- Perhaps if I learned some tricks,

16:41.636 --> 16:45.880
it wouldn't feel so strange
that I look like a magician.

16:45.895 --> 16:48.672
You'd have to learn
a lot of tricks.

16:48.685 --> 16:53.973
I mean, you'd basically you'd have
to actually become a magician.

16:53.986 --> 16:56.971
Do you really want to make
that kind of commitment?

17:00.357 --> 17:02.310
What was all that about?

17:02.328 --> 17:04.352
We was stitched up,
they knew we were there.

17:04.365 --> 17:05.142
Oh, shut up, Barry.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.450
It was always a possibility,
that's why we had the truck.

17:07.497 --> 17:11.403
We were barely out of there before the
bill turned up. Someone grassed us up.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.031
Oh, is that the...?

17:13.047 --> 17:16.032
Oh, I've got to go,
I don't want to miss Gok's Fashion Fix.

17:16.046 --> 17:17.862
Yeah, you're too
quick to trust people.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.510
What do we know about this bloke?
How do we know he didn't do it?

17:20.555 --> 17:23.540
Because he didn't know about
it till this afternoon.

17:23.558 --> 17:25.500
I didn't know about it
till this afternoon.

17:25.516 --> 17:28.131
That's why I chose him to
do it after you shot Derek.

17:28.146 --> 17:31.302
That's why he chose me to
do it after you shot Derek.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.842
Hello.

17:33.858 --> 17:35.930
Hiya.

17:35.948 --> 17:39.140
You remember Moss?

17:39.156 --> 17:41.730
So, tell me all about
the big robbery.

17:41.745 --> 17:43.482
What?

17:43.495 --> 17:46.061
Roy saw a robbery.

17:46.075 --> 17:48.903
Did you phone the police
like you said you would?

17:48.918 --> 17:53.033
I didn't say that,
I said I was listening to The Police.

17:53.047 --> 17:55.913
Look at all that money.
I wonder how much is there?

17:55.927 --> 17:58.030
Oh, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

17:58.048 --> 18:02.503
You and your bloody great ideas.
I mean, who's this bloke?

18:02.516 --> 18:05.871
All we know about him is
he supports West Ham.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.883
Or maybe that's a lie too.

18:07.897 --> 18:10.800
Hey, hey now, little man.

18:10.817 --> 18:15.300
You can stand there and
slag me off all you like.

18:15.317 --> 18:19.393
But don't you start talking about
how I feel about my beloved West Ham.

18:19.407 --> 18:20.973
Cos I love 'em.

18:20.988 --> 18:22.933
I love 'em gooners.

18:22.948 --> 18:24.943
That's bloody Arsenal.

18:24.956 --> 18:28.360
Look, if you've got a problem with him,
you've got a problem with me.

18:28.378 --> 18:29.941
You're fucking right I have!

18:29.958 --> 18:32.233
Excuse me,
I am trying to concentrate over here.

18:32.245 --> 18:36.611
And will you watch your ruddy language?
My ears are not a toilet.

18:36.628 --> 18:38.241
Derek was right about you.

18:38.258 --> 18:39.963
What are you after?
My piece of the action?

18:39.978 --> 18:41.832
You want to end up in
the boot with Derek, son?

18:41.875 --> 18:43.252
Do you want to make one?

18:43.268 --> 18:45.441
Yeah, I'll make one, mate.
I'll make one right now.

18:45.455 --> 18:47.410
Oh, yeah? Let's have it.
Don't you mug yourself.

18:47.456 --> 18:49.000
Let's have it!
Don't mug yourself!

18:57.636 --> 18:59.472
I need to know
how much is there.

18:59.487 --> 19:02.060
No, you don't.

19:02.076 --> 19:05.931
We need to get out of here, OK?
We do not want to get mixed up in this.

19:08.446 --> 19:10.481
What are we going
to do now? Quick.

19:12.328 --> 19:14.821
Get out of the way,
you bloody poof.

19:21.288 --> 19:23.043
OK, let's go.

19:24.668 --> 19:27.162
Couldn't we have just have
hidden behind those bins?

19:29.795 --> 19:32.343
I suppose.

20:00.536 --> 20:02.070
Right, let's go.

20:09.838 --> 20:14.133
So, er, if you just place
these back into the pack.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.963
Just pop it back in, that's it.
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

20:16.976 --> 20:22.683
And before your very eyes,
I shall do the magic shuffle.

20:22.698 --> 20:25.763
And, er - ignore that -
this will go in here

20:25.777 --> 20:30.102
and Bob's your uncle,
abracadabra, is this your card?

20:32.527 --> 20:34.522
No, Michael.

20:34.535 --> 20:36.571
I'm sorry, Michael,

20:36.588 --> 20:38.653
it's over.

20:43.165 --> 20:45.452
I better make sure
she's all right.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.502
Anyone see the final
last night, eh?

20:48.516 --> 20:49.913
Fuck off, Harry.

20:58.018 --> 21:02.131
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300,

21:02.147 --> 21:06.431
350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600...

21:11.896 --> 21:17.481
I think my dentist lives near here,
do you know him?

21:17.497 --> 21:20.572
That's a stupid question -
why would you know him?

21:20.588 --> 21:22.781
It's not like you
live in the truck.

21:24.208 --> 21:27.793
So, what sort of truck is this?
Are there different sorts of trucks?

21:27.807 --> 21:29.453
Is that a stupid question?

21:29.468 --> 21:33.171
Listen to me chatting away
like Stephen bloody Fry.

21:38.925 --> 21:40.880
Who closed the door?
