WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.458
So, have you written
your acceptance

00:03.503 --> 00:04.834
- speech yet?
- No.

00:04.871 --> 00:06.702
Because I am not going to win.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.537
Humility.
Nice touch, Keats.

00:08.575 --> 00:10.566
But I read that piece
you wrote about abortion,

00:10.610 --> 00:11.599
"Nancy's Choice."

00:11.644 --> 00:14.340
Unfortunately,
it is far too credible.

00:14.381 --> 00:15.973
Thousands of girls
like Nancy

00:16.082 --> 00:17.947
have unwanted
pregnancies every year.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.246
But she's the only
one I know

00:19.285 --> 00:22.379
who had her story told
by a brilliant writer.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.514
Thank you.

00:23.556 --> 00:24.716
I'm serious.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.282
The Collegiate
Press Club award

00:26.326 --> 00:27.987
is as good as
on your mantel,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.929
which is why if you don't have
a speech on my desk by 2:00,

00:30.964 --> 00:31.953
I'm gonna
write it for you.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.966
Let me guess:

00:34.000 --> 00:36.594
"And a special thanks
to Brandon Walsh."

00:36.636 --> 00:38.627
See? Writes itself.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.407
Didn't we give everyone
their assignments already?

00:45.445 --> 00:47.504
Yeah, hours ago.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.983
So as soon as you guys finish
your next issue,

00:52.018 --> 00:54.077
the mini-bar's on me, okay?

00:55.722 --> 00:56.746
All right, cool.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.553
Good. Good.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.183
All righty.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.756
Corrupting
the troops, I see.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.060
Yeah, well, I'm trying.

01:06.099 --> 01:07.088
How you doing, Brandon?

01:07.133 --> 01:08.259
Good.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.893
Susan, you should
be proud of me.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.530
I pressed my suit and
spit shined my dress shoes.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.540
What's the occasion?

01:14.574 --> 01:17.270
Jonathan's coming to the
awards dinner tomorrow night.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.971
Cool.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.412
I got a column to write.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.540
Excuse me.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.541
You knew he'd come.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.247
Sure, to hang out,
maybe to write a story.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.687
But not to be your date.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.984
You're my date.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.218
Right, that's why Jonathan
got his suit pressed

01:33.259 --> 01:34.988
and his shoes shined.

01:35.061 --> 01:35.993
Jonathan was editor of the paper

01:36.096 --> 01:37.825
when I wrote the story
about Nancy.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.695
I didn't invite him,
the committee did.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.700
Hey, it's not your
professional relationship

01:41.734 --> 01:42.894
I'm concerned with.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.234
Come on, we've been over this.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.568
Yes, we have.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.437
You keep telling me
it's over and it's not.

01:48.475 --> 01:50.705
So, have a nice day.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.661 --> 03:51.152
Kelly, I'll get
right to the point.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.630
The semester's
not a month old

03:52.665 --> 03:56.863
and you've already
missed several classes.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.234
Are you sure?

03:58.271 --> 04:01.331
'Cause I... I... I've been
late a couple of times.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.705
I've been sitting
in the back.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.233
Maybe I just missed
attendance or something.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.803
This is the third class
of mine you've been in.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.678
You've never sat
in the back before.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.513
What can I say?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.883
The commute's been hell.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.548
Kelly, you're
a bright student.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.851
Too bright for me
to believe

04:17.890 --> 04:19.949
your absenteeism is
a result of a SigAlert.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.263
Um...

04:25.298 --> 04:29.564
I've had some personal problems,

04:29.602 --> 04:32.765
and maybe that's been affecting
me more than I realized.

04:32.805 --> 04:33.965
Sorry to hear that.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.507
But there's a big test
coming up.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.101
And I'd really like to see you
do well on it.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.876
Oh, I'll do my best.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.814
That's all I can ask for.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.147
Hi.

04:51.257 --> 04:52.224
New professor?

04:52.258 --> 04:53.384
Just got tenure.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.518
She's cute.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.187
- You should ask her out.
- Oh, sweetheart...

04:56.229 --> 04:58.697
I know, I know,
keep my matchmaking to myself.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.096
But I can't help it, Dad.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.101
I don't even remember
the last time you had a date.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.397
It has been awhile.

05:03.436 --> 05:06.496
"Awhile" without a date
is like a month.

05:06.539 --> 05:07.938
You've gone years.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.372
That's an eternity.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.808
I'm doing the best I can.

05:10.843 --> 05:12.071
Well, maybe
you're too picky.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.079
That's sweet of you to say,
but the truth may be

05:14.113 --> 05:16.343
I'm just not the one
who's getting picked.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.440
Oh, come on.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.950
You're handsome,

05:19.018 --> 05:19.950
brilliant...

05:20.019 --> 05:22.044
You've got a sweet
and refined,

05:22.088 --> 05:23.282
kick-ass daughter.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.223
- What more could a woman want?
- I have no idea.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.624
But if you find out,
will you let me know?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.150
This is ridiculous, okay?
We're all going to the

05:29.195 --> 05:30.492
journalism awards dinner
tomorrow night.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.963
There's got to be
someone you can bring.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.259
There is.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.630
But you've already
got a date.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.131
You know, winning
a collegiate press club award

05:40.173 --> 05:43.267
is going to put your
career in high gear.

05:43.309 --> 05:45.971
Yeah, that's if I win.

05:46.045 --> 05:47.603
Oh, you'll win.

05:47.647 --> 05:48.875
You always do.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.247
Why did you show up
for this, Jonathan?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.513
I was invited.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.589
Jonathan...

05:57.623 --> 05:59.648
I came here to cheer you
on to victory, Suse.

05:59.692 --> 06:03.025
After all, who else knows

06:03.062 --> 06:04.689
how much you sacrificed
for this story?

06:04.731 --> 06:07.097
Right.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.034
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't mean that.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.663
I didn't.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.434
Column's on your desk.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.873
Brandon, please wait.

06:15.908 --> 06:16.932
You should go.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.910
Yeah.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.080
Please, sit down.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.415
What for?

06:26.452 --> 06:27.817
For another discussion
about how

06:27.854 --> 06:29.583
there's nothing going on
between you two? I'll pass.

06:29.622 --> 06:32.523
There is nothing going on
between us, okay?

06:32.558 --> 06:34.583
But I don't blame you
for thinking that.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.960
Will you please just sit and
listen to what I have to say?

06:37.997 --> 06:39.555
Please?

06:43.269 --> 06:46.466
Fine.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.666
I'm listening.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.345
Jonathan is pro-life.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.542
He didn't want me
to tell Nancy's story.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.948
So?

06:58.985 --> 07:01.715
So, he thinks
what she did was wrong.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.915
He also thinks
I infringed on her privacy.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.423
Did you?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.722
Well, sort of.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.354
I mean I did talk her into
letting me do the story.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.762
And how does she feel
about it now?

07:12.799 --> 07:15.324
I think it helped her heal.

07:15.368 --> 07:17.165
That's more important
than what Jonathan thinks.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.303
Jonathan was my mentor.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.672
A lot of the way I think
and the way I work

07:23.709 --> 07:24.835
came from our relationship.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.868
His disapproval
was very difficult for me.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.278
Is it still?

07:34.153 --> 07:35.484
Yeah.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.217
Yeah.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.697
Do you like this one?

07:50.736 --> 07:52.601
Mm, too sophisticated.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.969
Hmm...

07:54.073 --> 07:55.938
What about this one?

07:57.710 --> 08:00.577
Too perky.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.443
Here's one I bet
you'll like.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.611
Mmm, I'll say.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.413
Hey! Pay
attention to me.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.651
You brought me along
to look at dresses.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.922
- I'm looking at dresses.
- Yeah, my dresses, Steve.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.623
Now you tell me.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.307
Well, I gotta tell you, Elle,

08:34.347 --> 08:37.510
I've been a very, very bad boy.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.948
Really?

08:38.985 --> 08:41.179
Give me some sugar, baby.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.763
Easy, lover.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.900
What's this?

09:03.976 --> 09:06.137
Honey, like you didn't know.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.543
You're a guy! You're a guy!

09:13.486 --> 09:15.010
Steve!

09:15.054 --> 09:16.214
D'oh!

09:22.428 --> 09:24.623
Elle... what a surprise.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.825
It's nice
to see you again, Steve.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.194
Again?

09:30.503 --> 09:32.403
Clare, this is Elle.

09:32.438 --> 09:36.374
Elle, this is Clare,
my girlfriend.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.398
Oh.

09:37.443 --> 09:38.569
Lucky lady.

09:38.611 --> 09:39.578
Yeah, well,

09:39.612 --> 09:41.637
I'm beginning
to wonder.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.947
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

09:45.051 --> 09:46.814
but all this shopping
has got me toasted.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.376
My dogs are barking.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.946
Yeah, well, it was good
seeing you again, Steve.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.684
Oh, and the next time

09:52.725 --> 09:56.217
you're in Palm Springs,
don't forget to look me up.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.457
Okay?

10:03.703 --> 10:04.795
Don't ask.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.896
I'm asking.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.203
All right, we went out
on a date last spring.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.208
Mm-hmm.

10:10.242 --> 10:11.766
It didn't go
according to plan.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.609
Well, she seemed
to think it did.

10:14.647 --> 10:18.139
Well, when it comes to Elle,
looks can be deceiving.

10:19.585 --> 10:20.711
Oh, boy.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.680
What time are your parents
leaving to Santa Barbara?

10:24.724 --> 10:26.749
Well, they said they want
to be there by dinner.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.316
Can't wait, I've never
been there before.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.329
Oh, it is so great.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.830
Hiking up the mountain,

10:31.864 --> 10:33.832
horseback riding, sailing.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.595
My dad's got his
boat up there.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.865
Sounds like just what
the doctor ordered.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.929
Yeah, and it's our
first trip together.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.463
First of many.

10:43.943 --> 10:45.171
Hi.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.769
So you guys are going away
for the weekend, huh?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.337
Yeah.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.610
What are you doing?

10:51.684 --> 10:53.549
I'm sorry, you must
have me confused

10:53.586 --> 10:54.746
with someone else.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.345
I'm Donna Martin,
your ex-friend.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.455
I think I'll go
get the check.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.460
Look...

11:03.429 --> 11:05.226
I'm sorry, okay?

11:05.264 --> 11:06.697
I've been a
real bitch.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.199
That's an understatement.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.259
Yeah, well, I've been down,
you know?

11:10.302 --> 11:12.532
Things got a little out
of control.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.904
Well, I needed you badly, Kel,

11:15.941 --> 11:17.101
and you weren't there.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.838
I know.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.402
I'm sorry.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.676
I'm just worried about you.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.375
Line forms to the left.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.978
Yeah, it must be tough

11:29.088 --> 11:31.750
having people around you
that care.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.225
All right.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.169
Then it's settled.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.671
We'll laugh at your jokes.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.142
We'll be on your side
in all the arguments.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.145
And generally make
Jonathan's life a living hell.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.945
Good. This awards dinner
may not be all bad after all.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.142
Aw, speak for yourself.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.344
I still don't even have a dress.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.909
I thought you guys were

12:00.953 --> 12:03.080
shopping all afternoon.

12:03.122 --> 12:06.489
Um... I think it's my turn
to do the dishes.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.223
Steve? Dishes?

12:12.264 --> 12:13.925
What's wrong with this picture?

12:13.966 --> 12:15.729
He saw some old flame today.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.201
It totally freaked him out.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.329
And did it freak you out?

12:19.371 --> 12:21.464
No. Whatever, you know?

12:21.507 --> 12:22.667
Normally, I wouldn't have cared,

12:22.708 --> 12:24.972
but when it drives him
to dishpan hands,

12:25.077 --> 12:26.669
it kind of makes me wonder.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.407
Did you get a name?

12:28.447 --> 12:29.744
Yeah. Elle.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.113
Elle?

12:32.384 --> 12:33.942
From Palm Springs?

12:33.986 --> 12:36.978
You start cleaning, I'll scream.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.557
Clare, you really have

12:39.592 --> 12:41.651
absolutely nothing
to worry about.

12:42.928 --> 12:47.422
Elle's very, uh... unique.

12:47.466 --> 12:51.562
You know, if you're trying
to reassure me,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.299
you're not doing
a very good job.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.172
Would you excuse me?

12:59.145 --> 13:01.636
So, how did he look?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.045
Don't start, please. Just...

13:03.082 --> 13:04.413
Still tall, dark and handsome?

13:05.551 --> 13:07.041
You didn't tell her, did you?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.747
Tell me what?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.688
There is something
going on

13:10.723 --> 13:12.384
between you and that woman,
isn't there?

13:12.424 --> 13:14.790
No way. No way.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.795
Never. Never was,
never will be.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.731
They kissed.
They groped.

13:19.765 --> 13:20.891
What are you...?

13:20.933 --> 13:23.128
They had a
misunderstanding.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.864
Yeah, well, with Steve, that's
par for the course, okay?

13:24.904 --> 13:26.394
There's something
different about this.

13:26.438 --> 13:27.996
I want to know what.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.303
Elle has a peeky.

13:33.345 --> 13:37.406
You guys must really think
I'm stupid, huh?

13:37.449 --> 13:39.474
Clare, um...

13:41.320 --> 13:43.652
Elle is a transvestite.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.987
No. There's none of that.
She's full-on man.

13:46.058 --> 13:49.118
I think I know a beautiful woman
when I see one, okay?

13:49.161 --> 13:51.322
I thought so, too.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.763
Don't touch me like that.

13:53.799 --> 13:54.788
You know,
if you told me the truth,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.165
I'd probably deal with this.

13:56.202 --> 14:00.070
But, lying to me,
you're just making it worse.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.703
That was brave,
telling her the truth.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.677
First time, too.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.339
Won't happen again.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.540
That a boy.

14:11.450 --> 14:12.940
Ah! These two on the right
are my favorites.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.316
Yeah. Mine, too.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.821
Definitely. I'm sure
he'll love them.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.086
I hope so.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.092
You know, I owe you for this.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.718
Of course you do.

14:22.761 --> 14:24.194
That's why
I'm taking a cut.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.198
Well-deserved.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.700
By the way,
do you have any blow?

14:28.734 --> 14:29.723
Excuse me?

14:29.768 --> 14:31.326
I asked if you had any blow.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.930
You got the urge?

14:33.973 --> 14:39.240
No, but I see you still do.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.768
I'm using, not abusing.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.610
Better living through chemistry.
Is that it?

14:42.648 --> 14:43.706
Back off, Valerie.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.717
I tried that,
but it didn't work.

14:45.751 --> 14:46.581
Try again.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.679
What's going on?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.280
No, nothing much.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.620
We're just
going over some slides

14:52.658 --> 14:54.626
to show the collector
who wrote Valerie about me.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.924
He's in town.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.293
Are we done?

14:58.330 --> 15:01.629
Yeah.

15:01.667 --> 15:02.895
And you'll call me
when you hear?

15:02.935 --> 15:04.402
Right.

15:04.436 --> 15:05.528
Thanks.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.408
Why are you doing this?

15:14.446 --> 15:15.845
Money.

15:15.881 --> 15:16.905
That figures.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.917
- Why else?
- Call me crazy,

15:18.951 --> 15:20.316
but I figure a career boost

15:20.352 --> 15:22.115
might let him see that
he doesn't need to do drugs.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.486
Here's a little news
flash for you, Valerie.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.581
You're not his
guardian angel.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.182
I told you he was using, Kelly.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.956
Instead of helping him,
you decided to join the party.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.862
You can throw your life away...
that's fine by me...

15:32.898 --> 15:35.264
but Colin has too much talent
to throw away his.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.552
Morning.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.287
Morning.

16:02.328 --> 16:04.796
It would be if I wasn't up
all night studying.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.388
You know what?

16:06.432 --> 16:08.297
I've got just the thing.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.802
I don't think so.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.804
Come on.
Breakfast of champions.

16:12.838 --> 16:16.774
Truth is, I did a lot more
than studying last night.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.640
I did some thinking.

16:18.677 --> 16:22.807
And, um... I don't want
to do coke anymore.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.180
That's a switch.
What about last week?

16:25.217 --> 16:27.811
I binged, that's all.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.117
No problem. That just means
there's more for me.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.248
I want you to stop, too.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.918
Funny girl.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.291
No, I'm serious. It's no good.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.955
Kelly, I'm not quitting.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.329
How am I supposed to stop
if you're always doing it?

16:40.366 --> 16:42.698
It's called willpower.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.864
Colin, please.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.616
Where's my column?

17:06.657 --> 17:07.625
What's the big deal?

17:07.659 --> 17:08.626
I'll run it tomorrow.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.491
It was supposed to run today.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.759
I think it needs
some more reporting.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.560
Oh, really?
Do tell.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.262
Well, I think
it needs a second source,

17:18.303 --> 17:20.931
and a quote from someone
nonpartisan would be nice.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.872
What?

17:25.511 --> 17:26.808
I'm just doing my job.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.475
Well, if you'll excuse me,

17:33.519 --> 17:37.250
I, uh, have
some reporting to do.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.348
Good luck at the awards.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.484
Brandon, I need
you there tonight.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.792
No, you don't.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.821
You have Jonathan.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.958
Have a nice day.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.327
Right.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.306
I'm glad you liked the slides.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.671
Well, not so much
your early work,

17:56.708 --> 17:59.768
but what you've done recently
shows real maturity.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.404
Really? You,
you think so?

18:01.447 --> 18:02.573
No question.

18:02.614 --> 18:05.742
New techniques,
new insights.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.581
You've really grown
into your talent.

18:07.619 --> 18:11.680
I feel like I've, you
know, found my stride.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.554
Well, I think Mr. Penn wants
to look around,

18:13.592 --> 18:15.287
see if anything catches the eye.

18:15.327 --> 18:19.525
No problem,
take your time.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.930
This guy knows
a ton about art.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.523
And he loves your work.

18:22.568 --> 18:26.095
Yeah, it's been a long time
since someone's felt that way.

18:26.138 --> 18:30.507
Listen, about yesterday,
I know you meant well.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.033
If this is another brush-off,
I don't want to hear it.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.375
No.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.210
I tossed out my stash
this morning.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.148
Good.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.651
Can I ask you
about this one?

18:40.686 --> 18:42.119
Yeah, yeah, on my way.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.143
Colin.

18:44.189 --> 18:47.090
Listen,
you have a gift.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.458
If you take care of it,

18:49.495 --> 18:51.190
your career will take care
of itself.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.825
Thank you.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.730
This one.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.397
- You like it?
- This is really special.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.038
- What about Dean Lewis?
- She had plans.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.307
Professor Claypool?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.315
I called her; her boyfriend
answered the phone.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.782
Ouch.
Enough about me

19:11.817 --> 19:13.842
and my somewhat
nonexistent social life.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.413
Can we just find the ballroom
an-an-and have a good time?

19:17.456 --> 19:20.357
Fine by me.

19:20.392 --> 19:21.689
Oh, this can't be happening.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.831
Do you know that
ravishing creature?

19:28.867 --> 19:32.030
Yeah, too well.

19:33.071 --> 19:36.598
Twice in two days.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.371
I must be living right.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.605
Well, that's a matter
of opinion, isn't it?

19:40.646 --> 19:41.772
Clare, you look fabulous.

19:41.813 --> 19:42.939
I love your dress.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.312
Thanks.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.147
A. Milton Arnold,

19:47.186 --> 19:50.314
but please call me Arnold.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.220
Uh... what are you
doing here?

19:54.259 --> 19:56.625
There's a journalism
awards presentation.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.857
A friend of mine organized
the dinner.

20:00.065 --> 20:02.966
Yeah, that's why
we're here, too.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.433
Hope it's fun.

20:04.469 --> 20:05.959
Hmm, small world, then.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.868
Don't remind me.

20:07.906 --> 20:10.773
I... didn't catch the name.

20:10.809 --> 20:14.336
Uh...
Arnold, this is Elle.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.244
Elle, this
is Arnold.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.248
Hello, Arnold.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.613
Hello, Elle.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.413
I know it's not
much notice,

20:20.452 --> 20:23.615
but would you and your friend
care to join our table?

20:23.655 --> 20:24.986
Actually, my friend's

20:25.057 --> 20:26.854
probably too busy to sit.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.984
But I'd love to.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.892
Good. May I?

20:30.929 --> 20:32.396
Mm-hmm.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.990
Oh, they're so cute.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.591
Come on.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.901
You look like hell.

20:45.944 --> 20:49.004
Thanks, Nat, you really know
how to make a guy feel better.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.810
Well, from what
you told me,

20:50.849 --> 20:54.012
you need a good
kick in the pants.

20:54.052 --> 20:57.419
Nat, I... I just
can't figure it out.

20:57.456 --> 21:00.118
They break up
because of this story, right?

21:00.158 --> 21:01.750
But then when the article
gets nominated,

21:01.793 --> 21:03.317
he flies in
for the awards dinner.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.329
It doesn't make sense.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.957
Get out of your own way.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.124
The guy was invited.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.464
Yeah, to something that's got to

21:10.502 --> 21:11.969
remind him
why he got dumped.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.163
So he's a little cracked.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.333
That doesn't explain why
you're on your fourth cup.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.933
You think I should go?

21:18.977 --> 21:21.241
Unless you're giving up,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.872
you got to fight
for what you want.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.973
Easier said than done.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.383
They got some kind of bond
between them, these two.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.650
Oh, so I suppose the
answer's going to come to you

21:30.689 --> 21:31.883
by sitting here, huh?

21:31.923 --> 21:34.414
Is that a hint?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.654
Fine, I'm going.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.420
Good.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.897
Crazy...

21:52.778 --> 21:54.746
So, Arnold Arnold?

21:54.780 --> 21:55.974
Yeah, that's right.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.448
All my friends used
to call me Arnold Squared.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.215
I've never seen
my dad flirt like this.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.245
I'm telling you, Clare,
it's not going to end well.

22:04.289 --> 22:05.278
You know, this whole
jealousy thing...

22:05.324 --> 22:06.689
i-it's bugging me, all right?

22:06.725 --> 22:07.919
I am not jealous.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.358
I'm only looking out
for your father.

22:09.394 --> 22:11.658
My old man is
having a good time

22:11.697 --> 22:13.665
with a beautiful, young woman
who's totally into him.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.360
You mess that up,
we're finished.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.424
Tell me, Clare,

22:16.468 --> 22:18.959
does your father prefer
clams or mussels?

22:19.037 --> 22:21.267
Ugh.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.137
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.142
It is now.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.143
Didn't think

22:25.177 --> 22:26.201
you were going to make it.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.506
You must have
been disappointed.

22:27.546 --> 22:28.808
Ah...

22:28.847 --> 22:30.542
Clare, Chancellor, Elle.

22:30.582 --> 22:31.549
Elle?

22:31.583 --> 22:32.914
You remember me.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.919
I'm touched.

22:34.953 --> 22:36.250
How could I forget?

22:36.288 --> 22:37.949
Explanation?

22:37.989 --> 22:41.390
Uh, sh-he's
the chancellor's date.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.587
No, the real
explanation.

22:43.628 --> 22:46.620
And to think
I almost didn't come.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.625
So, what did I miss?

22:53.472 --> 22:55.372
- Hey.
- Hey. Pull up a stool.

22:55.407 --> 22:58.342
Oh, no, no, I'm just
picking up some stuff.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.504
Hello, my sweetheart.
What'll it be?

23:00.545 --> 23:01.705
Two pieces of peach pie.

23:01.747 --> 23:03.840
- You got it.
- To go.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.243
You sure you can't stay?

23:07.285 --> 23:10.777
No. Um, I'm, uh, meeting
Colin at his place.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.422
Well, I hate to say it,

23:14.459 --> 23:17.690
but Colin's not exactly
on the, uh, top of my "A" list.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.555
Yeah.

23:20.599 --> 23:24.399
He, uh, told me about
you confronting him.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.734
You're not your sister's
keeper, you know.

23:28.106 --> 23:30.131
Somebody's got to be.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.666
Colin is not
doing drugs anymore,

23:32.711 --> 23:34.144
and neither am I.

23:34.179 --> 23:35.305
Oh, you quit?

23:35.347 --> 23:36.507
Cold turkey?

23:36.548 --> 23:38.607
Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

23:38.650 --> 23:41.380
things just got, uh,
out of control for me.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.047
It was like a binge.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.952
- A binge?
- Mm-hmm.

23:47.993 --> 23:51.121
Yes. Like a reaction
to bad news.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.960
My dad and everything.

23:52.998 --> 23:54.431
Right.

23:54.466 --> 23:57.663
Crying is
a reaction to bad news.

23:57.702 --> 23:58.862
Insomnia.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.098
Blowing off homework.

24:00.138 --> 24:01.765
Not doing coke.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.775
Okay, whatever
you say, Dr. Freud.

24:03.809 --> 24:07.506
The point is that
I'm done with it.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.080
I thought
you would be relieved.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.310
I would be if I believed you.

24:15.353 --> 24:17.480
Well, believe this...

24:17.522 --> 24:19.956
I, um, pulled an
all-nighter last night,

24:20.058 --> 24:22.219
took a big test
today... all clean.

24:22.260 --> 24:26.196
So, when was the last time
you thought about cocaine?

24:26.231 --> 24:27.892
What do you mean?

24:27.933 --> 24:29.366
You know exactly what I mean.

24:29.401 --> 24:32.029
When was the last time
you thought about doing a line?

24:33.071 --> 24:34.732
This morning.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.503
But I didn't do it.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.237
Kel, it's called

24:39.277 --> 24:40.471
white-knuckle sobriety.

24:40.512 --> 24:41.979
Eventually you're
not gonna be able

24:42.013 --> 24:44.208
to take it anymore,
and you're gonna let go.

24:44.249 --> 24:46.877
No. You're wrong about that.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.414
Whatever you say.

24:51.456 --> 24:53.356
Two slices to go.
Anything else?

24:53.391 --> 24:54.824
Nope. That'll be it.

25:03.535 --> 25:05.332
You're kidding me, right?

25:05.370 --> 25:09.670
Well, if you don't believe me...

25:09.708 --> 25:11.938
believe this.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.911
10,000 reasons
to stay clean.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.511
What are you talking about?

25:17.549 --> 25:18.846
Don't you see?
Sterling Penn

25:18.884 --> 25:21.114
didn't just happen to walk
into the After Dark.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.380
He came as a sign.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.513
- I know... manna from Heaven.
- Exactly.

25:24.556 --> 25:25.853
I mean, just when
you were about

25:25.891 --> 25:27.518
to blow your talent
up your nose,

25:27.559 --> 25:29.049
he came as a
reminder not to.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.688
Nice try, Val, but I'm afraid
you have it all backwards.

25:31.730 --> 25:32.662
Well, I don't see how. I mean,

25:32.697 --> 25:33.629
he bought your paintings, right?

25:33.665 --> 25:35.189
He bought two of my paintings.

25:35.233 --> 25:36.632
Each one I painted high.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.862
So?

25:37.903 --> 25:39.461
So, come on, Val, all that stuff

25:39.504 --> 25:40.835
about new techniques,
new insights?

25:40.872 --> 25:42.601
How the hell do you think
that all happened?

25:42.641 --> 25:43.630
Well, it's like he said.

25:43.675 --> 25:44.937
I mean, you grew
into your talent.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.068
You're damn right I did.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.635
With a little help
from my friends.

25:47.679 --> 25:48.873
You're finished, right?

25:48.914 --> 25:50.882
I mean, you told me
you threw away your stash.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.645
Like an idiot,
I threw away my stash.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.151
But thanks to you
and thanks

25:54.185 --> 25:56.881
to this check, I can afford
to correct that mistake.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.787
Colin, you don't
need coke to paint.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.222
No.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.624
I only need it to paint well.

26:12.470 --> 26:13.801
And the award
for best spot reporting

26:13.838 --> 26:19.640
goes to Kerry Middleton
of the Brown Daily Herald.

26:19.678 --> 26:23.546
Kerry couldn't be here tonight,
which means, of course,

26:23.582 --> 26:25.550
if we all don't tell her,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.950
I'll be happy to give her award
to the runner-up.

26:28.053 --> 26:29.953
Just kidding.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.523
That's Pete Conrad...
the guy walked on the moon.

26:32.557 --> 26:34.491
Yeah, I loved his
keynote speech.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.653
Susan,
you're next.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.458
Forgive me for asking,

26:38.496 --> 26:39.963
but what did you
write about?

26:40.065 --> 26:42.158
A woman's right
to choose.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.760
Did you ever wonder why men
never have the right to choose?

26:44.803 --> 26:46.930
I don't know, Steve,
maybe it has something to do

26:46.972 --> 26:50.169
with the fact that men
don't have a uterus or ovaries.

26:50.208 --> 26:52.301
Or, uh, morning sickness,
labor pains,

26:52.344 --> 26:54.574
C-sections or
sagging breasts.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.706
Aren't you glad
you asked, big guy?

26:56.748 --> 26:58.477
You make pregnancy

26:58.516 --> 27:00.074
sound like a burden.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.585
I think it's such a gift.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.144
Have you ever
been pregnant?

27:05.156 --> 27:07.056
Uh, no, I can't
have children.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.525
Ooh, I'm so sorry.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.426
That's okay.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.055
Don't say a word.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.759
Personally, uh,

27:14.799 --> 27:17.700
I don't think that men or women
should have the right to choose.

27:17.736 --> 27:18.668
You don't believe in abortion?

27:18.703 --> 27:20.330
No. No, I don't.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.067
Actually, that's why Susan said

27:22.107 --> 27:23.802
you guys broke up...
you didn't want her

27:23.842 --> 27:25.901
- to write the Nancy story.
- Really.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.411
- Is that what she told you?
- Yes, it is.

27:27.445 --> 27:28.412
Would you care to elaborate?

27:28.446 --> 27:31.882
And now, the award

27:31.916 --> 27:33.247
for best feature article.

27:33.284 --> 27:36.583
The nominees are:
Susan Keats

27:36.621 --> 27:38.953
from the California
University Condor;

27:39.024 --> 27:41.083
Peter King
from the Harvard Crimson...

27:41.126 --> 27:45.187
Susan, win or lose, you
did the university proud.

27:45.230 --> 27:45.958
Hear, hear.

27:46.031 --> 27:46.963
Cheers.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.327
...from the Dartmouth Eagle;

27:48.366 --> 27:50.095
and Jerry Lairmen

27:50.135 --> 27:52.103
from the Michigan Daily News.

27:52.137 --> 27:54.867
And the award
for best feature article

27:54.906 --> 27:56.498
goes to Susan Keats

27:56.541 --> 28:00.068
of the California Condor.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.102
Congratulations.

28:28.406 --> 28:29.896
Thank you very much.

28:31.309 --> 28:35.746
You, uh, you don't know
how much this means to me.

28:35.780 --> 28:40.683
I'd like to accept this award
on behalf of all the women...

28:40.719 --> 28:42.949
who every day have to face

28:43.054 --> 28:47.650
this very difficult
and very personal decision.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.661
Women who, regardless
of the choice they make,

28:50.695 --> 28:54.131
have to live
the rest of their life...

28:54.165 --> 28:57.931
with the consequence
of their action.

28:57.969 --> 28:59.937
If Nancy were here tonight,

28:59.971 --> 29:04.169
I can't say she might not regret
her choice to have an abortion.

29:04.209 --> 29:07.076
The effects are that profound

29:07.112 --> 29:09.478
and the consequences
are that lasting.

29:09.514 --> 29:12.915
That's why winning this award
is very special...

29:12.951 --> 29:16.318
it honors more than choice,
it also honors courage.

29:16.354 --> 29:17.651
Thank you.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.169
- Hi.
- Perfect timing.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.140
The soufflé is in the oven.

29:37.175 --> 29:40.042
Oh, I can't believe
you did all of this.

29:40.078 --> 29:41.409
Eh, it's no big deal.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.573
It only took me
about... six hours.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.512
Well, I guess I should

29:46.551 --> 29:48.576
ace my psych test more often.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.884
Actually, we do have
a little more to celebrate.

29:50.922 --> 29:54.050
Not that your doing well
isn't reason enough, but...

29:54.092 --> 29:55.218
But what?

29:57.095 --> 29:58.926
I sold two paintings today.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.123
You did?

30:00.165 --> 30:02.190
Oh, that's fantastic!

30:02.233 --> 30:03.757
You will not believe

30:03.802 --> 30:05.269
for how much.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.635
Um... $5,000.

30:07.672 --> 30:09.435
Nuh-uh. $10,000.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.169
You're right,
I don't believe that.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.905
I feel like I'm
finally on my way.

30:13.945 --> 30:15.435
I'm so proud of you, baby.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.244
We should be proud
of each other.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.648
And we should
celebrate right now.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.549
My thoughts exactly.
You stay right here.

30:21.586 --> 30:22.985
What are you getting?

30:23.021 --> 30:26.388
I thought we agreed
no more coke, Colin.

30:26.424 --> 30:27.550
What'd you say?

30:27.592 --> 30:29.219
I couldn't hear you.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.989
I, uh, I-I said...

30:31.062 --> 30:33.462
I-I hoped that
you got some champagne.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.487
Are you kidding?

30:34.532 --> 30:36.500
Cashed the check,
got the Dom.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.801
I am so happy right now.

30:52.984 --> 30:54.781
Toast.

30:54.819 --> 30:58.346
To a very beautiful and
brilliant future psychologist.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.448
And to a successful

31:00.491 --> 31:03.221
and incredibly sexy artist.

31:03.261 --> 31:05.195
Cheers.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.198
Mmm.

31:37.762 --> 31:39.753
Ah.

31:44.269 --> 31:45.497
Ladies' room fetish.

31:45.536 --> 31:46.935
Love it.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.268
Blush?

31:48.306 --> 31:49.603
I want you to
leave now.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.768
Oh, and disappoint
square Arnold.

31:51.809 --> 31:54.801
Square Arnold hasn't
had a date in a decade.

31:54.846 --> 31:58.009
Well, good, then maybe
he won't mind the equipment.

31:58.116 --> 32:01.108
You know, female-wise,
the guy's ego is in the tank.

32:01.152 --> 32:03.347
If he finds out the only woman
interested in him is

32:03.388 --> 32:05.413
a man,
he'll never recover.

32:05.456 --> 32:08.425
You did.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.427
Please don't...

32:10.461 --> 32:13.453
I'm begging you,
don't do this.

32:14.632 --> 32:17.624
Give me one
good reason.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.660
I'm in love with
his daughter.

32:27.378 --> 32:29.369
Spoilsport.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.081
Hi.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.998
You're a good guy, Steve.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.091
Don't tell anybody.

32:53.104 --> 32:55.004
How far did you, um,

32:55.106 --> 32:57.904
get with Elle?

32:57.942 --> 33:00.103
You know, I don't,
I don't really want to know.

33:01.212 --> 33:02.873
Mm.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.086
It's Perfect.

33:10.121 --> 33:12.112
You think?

33:12.156 --> 33:15.489
Yeah. You honored the people
who deserved it.

33:15.526 --> 33:19.792
Like you said,
they're the courageous ones.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.264
I don't know.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.733
Nancy's not even
her real name.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.167
And if she's so brave,

33:25.203 --> 33:27.797
why did she insist on
using a pseudonym?

33:27.839 --> 33:31.104
You said it yourself:
She wants her privacy.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.072
She does.

33:34.112 --> 33:37.548
Still, I think she'd like
to know about the award.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.174
You should call
her and tell her.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.846
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult...

33:48.893 --> 33:51.123
I'm Nancy.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.290
What?

33:58.169 --> 34:00.797
The story, it's mine.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.839
You had an abortion?

34:10.148 --> 34:11.581
Yeah, last year.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.815
Jonathan?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.847
How'd that happen?

34:20.891 --> 34:23.326
You mean how could we have
been so irresponsible?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.726
Yeah.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.262
I was lost.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.790
My sister had
just been killed,

34:30.835 --> 34:31.802
and I needed to...

34:31.835 --> 34:33.167
You know what?

34:33.204 --> 34:35.138
I don't have the right
to ask you that question.

34:35.172 --> 34:36.868
You don't owe me
an explanation.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.170
Yes, I do.

34:42.580 --> 34:47.779
When I found out my sister
was dead, I went numb.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.346
Actually, I went for the vodka,
and then I went numb.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.981
You were drunk?

34:53.056 --> 34:55.547
We both were.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.465
What did Jonathan say
when you told him?

35:01.499 --> 35:07.460
Well, let me see if I can
remember his exact words.

35:07.505 --> 35:08.836
Oh, yeah.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.773
He said, "Will you marry me"?

35:24.255 --> 35:26.655
I'm sorry.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.327
Yeah, so am I.

35:45.776 --> 35:49.109
So, does it change anything?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.342
Knowing that I'm Nancy?

35:51.382 --> 35:53.714
How do you mean?

35:55.720 --> 35:58.484
I had an abortion, Brandon.

35:58.523 --> 36:01.617
Does that change anything?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.923
Are you asking for
my political opinion?

36:04.028 --> 36:07.020
You know what
I'm asking you.

36:07.064 --> 36:11.592
Yeah, I do.

36:11.636 --> 36:14.833
And...

36:18.209 --> 36:20.074
And it doesn't change a thing.

36:28.286 --> 36:29.651
Gee, I hope
I'm not interrupting.

36:31.222 --> 36:34.851
No, Jonathan, actually,
your timing is perfect.

36:37.228 --> 36:38.957
For once.

36:39.063 --> 36:41.054
I'll see you back inside.

36:48.606 --> 36:53.134
You know, I'm doing
my best to hate that guy.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.974
I've tried.
It doesn't work.

36:55.012 --> 36:57.276
Yeah, well, I'm trying
to hate you, too.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.584
Is that why you came here
tonight, Jonathan?

37:02.620 --> 37:04.053
To remind me?

37:04.088 --> 37:06.181
I came back because
we never talked about it.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.691
You made your choice
and that was it.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.022
That's not true.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.459
Are you saying

37:10.494 --> 37:12.519
- I could've changed your mind?
- No.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.758
I wasn't going
to change my life

37:14.799 --> 37:16.232
because of an accident.

37:16.267 --> 37:17.632
Oh, that's a great way to talk

37:17.668 --> 37:18.726
about a child.

37:20.371 --> 37:23.135
Spare me the sanctimonious
crap, Jonathan!

37:23.174 --> 37:25.802
You were pro-choice until you
realized you didn't have one.

37:25.843 --> 37:26.810
That's a low blow.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.106
It was supposed to be.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.985
I'm sorry.

37:38.689 --> 37:43.023
You know, I didn't think
that I could forgive you.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.830
But, uh, I was wrong.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.471
Congratulations.

37:55.506 --> 37:58.532
I still can't believe I won.

37:58.576 --> 38:01.636
Well, you're going to be famous.

38:01.679 --> 38:03.909
A big star, Susan, just
like you always wanted.

38:03.948 --> 38:08.044
Yeah. Just like.

38:08.085 --> 38:09.848
Yeah.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.613
What a great evening.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.947
I can't remember the last
time I had this much fun.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.644
Oh, come on,
a great guy like you?

38:42.687 --> 38:43.949
I don't believe it.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.888
Well, let me, uh, let me
convince you over drinks?

38:45.923 --> 38:48.915
Dad, you drove us, remember?

38:48.959 --> 38:51.723
You guys take the car.
I'll grab a cab.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.890
- What do you say?
- I'd love to...

38:57.034 --> 39:00.094
Unfortunately, I have an
early flight tomorrow.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.104
Flight?

39:01.138 --> 39:02.332
Where are you going?

39:02.373 --> 39:03.738
New York.

39:03.774 --> 39:04.866
A modeling assignment.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.001
Will you be gone long?

39:06.043 --> 39:08.011
Well, not in New York.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.910
Oh, then you'll be back soon.

39:09.947 --> 39:12.916
No, no. That is, after
New York, I'm off to Paris

39:12.950 --> 39:15.145
and then Milan,
so...

39:15.186 --> 39:16.744
I see.

39:16.787 --> 39:20.780
Hey, you are a great guy,
Arnold Arnold.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.191
And I know you're going to
make some woman very happy.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.388
Thank you.

39:25.429 --> 39:29.866
I know you're going to do
the same for some guy.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.925
I hope so.

39:40.711 --> 39:41.803
Thanks.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.871
- The things I do for love.
- Hmm.

39:46.450 --> 39:48.179
Are you okay?

39:48.219 --> 39:50.084
Yeah...

39:50.121 --> 39:51.520
I am.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.955
You heard the lady.

39:54.024 --> 39:56.219
I'm a catch.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.751
Yep, you are.

40:05.603 --> 40:07.332
That feels so good.

40:07.371 --> 40:12.536
Man, your back is
just full of knots.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.634
Why don't you relax?

40:13.677 --> 40:14.871
Let it go.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.209
How?

40:16.247 --> 40:18.112
I mean, instead of helping
Colin kick his habit,

40:18.149 --> 40:19.810
I just made everything worse.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.910
Yeah, well, you did your best.
That's all you can do.

40:22.953 --> 40:27.447
Like my dad always said,
no good deed goes unpunished.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.391
You know, I think Kelly's
really trying to quit.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.985
Maybe she can influence
him a little bit.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.494
Or he'll influence her.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.090
Kelly's pretty tough
when she wants to be.

40:36.767 --> 40:37.734
Better?

40:37.768 --> 40:39.167
Yes, much.

40:39.203 --> 40:40.898
Okay, your turn.

40:40.938 --> 40:44.203
- All right, great.
- Shirt off.

40:44.241 --> 40:46.801
My back has been
killing me.

40:46.844 --> 40:50.575
David, have you
been working out?

40:50.614 --> 40:52.980
Oh, a little bit.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.951
You look great.

40:54.985 --> 40:55.974
Thanks.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.612
You feel great.

41:00.724 --> 41:02.692
Wait, did you forget
about my massage?

41:02.726 --> 41:07.026
No. I'm just going for
the full-body variety.

41:15.172 --> 41:18.164
You left this inside.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.734
Thankfully your purse
goes with my outfit.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.346
It's heavy.

41:29.386 --> 41:32.549
You know, doubting your decision

41:32.590 --> 41:33.989
doesn't mean you made
the wrong one.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.822
Yeah, I wish I could
be sure of that.

41:36.861 --> 41:40.661
You'll always wonder
what might have been.

41:40.698 --> 41:44.361
At least now I see
what your connection

41:44.401 --> 41:47.768
with Jonathan is.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.705
He forgave me.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.799
That was important to you, huh?

41:51.842 --> 41:57.337
Now if I can only
forgive myself.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.815
Is there anything I can do?

42:01.652 --> 42:03.643
Just hold me.

42:23.941 --> 42:26.171
Colin Robbins, if I
did not know better,

42:26.210 --> 42:28.201
I would think that you're
trying to get me drunk

42:28.245 --> 42:29.269
and take advantage of me.

42:29.313 --> 42:30.780
I am taking advantage of you.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.304
I'm trying.

42:32.349 --> 42:33.873
Well, you're doing
a good job.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.510
Keep up the good work.

42:37.521 --> 42:39.284
Tonight was a perfect night.

42:39.323 --> 42:40.984
Good food, good wine...

42:41.058 --> 42:43.288
Okay soufflé.

42:43.327 --> 42:44.851
But great soufflé maker.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.337
You know what would taste
so good right now?

42:55.372 --> 42:56.532
I do.

42:59.343 --> 43:01.368
But we can't.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.777
Said we wouldn't.

43:02.813 --> 43:03.939
It's a good thing

43:04.014 --> 43:06.141
you threw out our stash.

43:07.651 --> 43:10.119
You did throw it
out, didn't you?

43:10.154 --> 43:11.849
Of course I did.

43:11.889 --> 43:12.947
Most of it.

43:13.023 --> 43:15.753
Oh, you're a bad boy.

43:15.793 --> 43:17.590
I feel terrible, too.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.756
Am I forgiven?

43:19.797 --> 43:20.764
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh?

43:20.798 --> 43:21.765
Uh-uh.

43:21.799 --> 43:23.790
Never.

43:25.402 --> 43:26.699
What?

43:26.737 --> 43:28.329
Nothing.

43:28.372 --> 43:30.636
- Come on. What?
- Nothing.

43:30.674 --> 43:32.539
What do you want to do?

43:32.576 --> 43:33.838
Same thing as you.

43:33.877 --> 43:36.277
Then what are we waiting for?

43:36.313 --> 43:37.746
Get it.
