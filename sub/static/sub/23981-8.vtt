My angel.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.686
-Oh...

01:44.521 --> 01:46.481
Oh, no, I can explain.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.691
What's happening, Randy?

01:48.775 --> 01:51.402
It's just a little situation
I got going on.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.363
It's nothing big.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.365
Randy, do you live in your car?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.158
No, I do not live in my car.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.245
So, when I say I need a night alone
to get some rest

02:00.328 --> 02:03.915
and you say you're going home,
do you go sleep in your car?

02:03.998 --> 02:07.127
Okay, yeah. That's what I do,
but it's just temporary.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.170
I Airbnb'd my apartment for cash.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.296
For how long?

02:11.506 --> 02:12.549
For six months.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.592
Six months?

02:14.676 --> 02:18.012
That's not temporary, you're homeless!
I have a homeless boyfriend.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.973
I didn't wanna be a mooch anymore, okay?

02:20.056 --> 02:23.977
I felt like shit after I borrowed money
from you, and I just wanna save up.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.815
-I wanna be the guy you deserve, Bertie.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.192
Look...

02:32.902 --> 02:35.822
There's another reason that
I'm not staying at my apartment, okay?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.365
What is it?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.286
I'll tell you,
but promise you won't laugh at me.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.581
I promise you there is zero chance
I'm gonna start laughing right now.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.876
My apartment's haunted.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.296
Last time I was there, I walked in,

02:51.379 --> 02:54.674
and I saw this little ghost girl,
and she was holding a fucking mirror.

02:54.757 --> 02:58.928
Nope, no, no, no. Guess what.
There aren't ghosts. Ghosts aren't real.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.722
Ghosts are real.
I saw them with my own eyes.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.808
Forget about ghosts, okay?
Even though they're real.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.018
I love you, Bertie.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.313
Look, I know I fucked up
by not telling you I live in my car,

03:08.396 --> 03:09.647
but I love you.

03:09.731 --> 03:13.902
You're the nicest, funniest, sweetest,
kindest person I've ever met.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.864
I know that I'm a mess. I just need
a chance to get my life together, okay?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.866
Just, please, give me a chance.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.578
Let's talk about this later.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.204
Thank you, Bertie-bear.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.466
Is it cool if I brush my teeth
in your house?

03:37.717 --> 03:39.594
-Yep, great.
-Okay, cool.

03:39.677 --> 03:42.597
Let me just get my toothbrush.
It's in here.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.849
I got a bunch of toiletries.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.061
Jesus Christ! It smells so bad!

03:48.144 --> 03:49.354
You think so?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.440
I must be used to it.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.609
What are all those loose feathers?

03:56.152 --> 03:58.655
I left my window down one night.
It was roasting hot.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.617
I woke up. There was a pigeon
on my chest, staring at me.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.371
I didn't kill it or anything,
but it was crazy getting it out of there.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.976
Okay, good one today, guys.

04:28.059 --> 04:32.355
We're bringing out the ratchet pull.
Anybody know what that is? Chris!

04:32.438 --> 04:36.526
Ratchet pull, you start
with a simple harness-to-cable hookup,

04:36.609 --> 04:38.069
also known as a jerk vest.

04:38.152 --> 04:42.657
Um, then from there, you just attach it
to a high point, the cable,

04:42.740 --> 04:45.994
and then it's just all a math problem
from there.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.620
Yes. All right!

04:47.704 --> 04:51.541
I'mma walk each of you through
a few fight moves before each pull.

05:15.440 --> 05:20.903
-Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
-Yeah! Yeah!

05:25.742 --> 05:27.368
-Good morning.
-Yo.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.619
Hey.

05:28.703 --> 05:33.541
I got you a latte.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.588
Dude, thanks.
I'm not even gonna question this

05:38.671 --> 05:42.467
because it's my first day off cigarettes,
and I would kill for stimulants. So...

05:42.550 --> 05:43.593
Are you kidding?

05:43.676 --> 05:46.429
Good for you.
You know, that is not easy.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.514
-You can do this. Okay.
-All right.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.516
-Thank you.
-No problem.

05:51.976 --> 05:52.810
So, what's up?

05:52.894 --> 05:55.438
What's up

05:55.521 --> 05:57.607
Well, as you know,

05:57.690 --> 06:01.486
my situation around here
has been less than ideal lately.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.739
I hemorrhaged listeners
when they cut my show an hour.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.576
I think the fans are so broken up about it
that they stopped listening altogether.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.369
Yeah. That's maybe it.

06:10.453 --> 06:15.750
So, I was wondering
if I could come on Stella's show.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.210
Uh...

06:17.293 --> 06:20.171
We could do, like,
a he said-she said kind of a thing.

06:20.254 --> 06:24.592
People call in and we each give advice
or whatever you want.

06:24.675 --> 06:28.679
I have to mention the book,
but I am game for anything.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.473
Um...

06:31.516 --> 06:33.017
It's an interesting idea.

06:34.143 --> 06:38.314
Look, you know how hard it is for me
to ask you for this.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.150
All right, I will ask Stella.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.278
-It's her show, but I will try.
-Thanks, Mick.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.242
-Hey, Chris.
-Hey, Patty.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.120
-I'm loving what I'm seeing out of you.
-Oh, thanks.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.247
That fight earlier?
You made me believe.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.125
You made me believe. It felt like
you were really trying to kill me.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.334
-Yeah, I was.
-Ha!

06:59.001 --> 07:01.712
Yeah, I just really want
to take this seriously.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.882
Like, someday maybe I'll be
the Daniel Day-Lewis of stuntmen.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.303
Not Daniel Day-Lewis' stuntman, but...
I mean, that'd be cool, too.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.805
Right, right.

07:10.888 --> 07:13.141
Hey, you know
the WaterWorld stunt show at Universal?

07:13.224 --> 07:14.392
At Universal? Yeah.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.437
That's probably the best
live stunt show of all time.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.314
Well, the director is actually
a good friend of mine.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.151
And no promises,
but I think I can get you an audition.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.694
-Yeah.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.696
Oh, my God, that would be amazing.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.030
-Great.
Oh, my God!

07:28.114 --> 07:29.490
-Thank you, Patty.
-No problem.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.785
I actually watched that movie recently,
it still holds up.

07:32.869 --> 07:37.665
And Kevin Costner at the beginning
of the first scene, drinking his own piss,

07:37.748 --> 07:40.168
which a lot of people
got grossed out about.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.962
But if you think about it,
you can't drink saltwater.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.007
-Right. I actually haven't seen the movie.
-Oh, yeah.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.093
-Thanks, Patty.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.271
I'm saying, why don't we give
these two lines to Brooklyn?

08:42.855 --> 08:47.610
I mean, Brooklyn is a kind of
a good actress. She just, you know...

08:48.319 --> 08:50.279
Can't say lines well.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.114
-Hey.
Dude!

08:52.198 --> 08:54.492
-Jesus!
Hi.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.578
Oh, sorry. Do you guys know where Gus is?

08:57.662 --> 08:58.663
Are you a friend of Gus'?

08:58.746 --> 09:01.791
-Yeah, he's my best friend.
-Not surprising.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.795
We don't know where Gus is, I'm sorry.
Um, what's your name?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.755
-Randy Monahan.
-Randy, Wyatt. Nice to meet you.

09:07.838 --> 09:08.923
Nice to meet you.

09:09.006 --> 09:12.093
Don't worry about it.
We're talking about the script.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.428
Gus might be over there or over there.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.930
Walk around till you find him maybe.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.849
-I'm not in the script.
-No, we know that.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.435
-Gus. Hey.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.480
Sorry. This is my friend Randy.
It's his first day on set as an extra.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.232
-We met.
He's really--

09:26.315 --> 09:29.235
I've been sleeping in my Jeep,
and my girlfriend's pretty pissed off,

09:29.318 --> 09:32.905
-so I'm trying to get some extra cash.
-Okay. Let's wrap this conversation up.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.702
You shouldn't really talk to these guys.
They're very important. Yeah.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.581
-Oh, cool. Nice to meet you guys.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.833
-Yeah. Hey, great show.
-Oh, thanks.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.418
-Okay. Bye. Come on.
-Bye.

09:45.501 --> 09:46.836
Good to have you on board.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.757
Hey, Randy, it's no big deal,
but you probably just should talk to me.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.010
Those guys are kinda grouchy
-Yeah, yeah.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.140
It's good. I mean, stressful.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.726
Just sticking my chin out
and making this thing.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.145
Even if it comes out great
and I put it online,

10:04.228 --> 10:05.980
I don't know if anybody's gonna watch it.

10:06.063 --> 10:11.235
Yeah. You should put someone famous in it.
Like Matt Damon or Blythe Danner.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.863
-Blythe Danner.
-She's Gwyneth Paltrow's mom.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.617
No, I know of her. I just
don't know Blythe Danner personally.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.952
Well, how about Arya?
You know her.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.164
Yeah, you know what? Actually...

10:24.373 --> 10:28.628
that <i>Liberty Down</i> movie is gonna come out.
She's gonna blow up from that.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.463
But a lot of people
would watch my short if--

10:30.546 --> 10:33.591
Hey, Gus. And your buddy. Sorry.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.927
We can hear you. Could you guys
just give us some room?

10:37.011 --> 10:40.097
-Just clear the stage.
-Oh! Yeah, we'll keep it down, sorry.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.893
Don't keep it down. Maybe instead
of keeping it down, just go?

10:43.976 --> 10:44.852
Go!

10:44.935 --> 10:46.979
Oh, sorry. Bye.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.356
Hey, that reminds me,

10:48.439 --> 10:50.900
as far as food stuff goes,
I can take whatever I want?

10:51.692 --> 10:56.072
Anyway, I've had sex with 36 people.
Only three of them more than once.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.783
Is that sad or awesome?
I can't really tell.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.702
You know you can talk to me
about stuff other than sex, right?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.747
-Yeah.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.334
No, no! You just quit!
You are not supposed to be out here.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.835
I'm not gonna smoke, relax.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.546
I just miss the ritual.
I wanna be with you guys.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.632
Why'd you quit in the first place?

11:14.715 --> 11:17.385
You would have already gotten cancer,
right?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.178
I don't think that science checks out.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.264
Can I sniff your hand?

11:22.348 --> 11:23.599
Weird. No.

11:23.682 --> 11:27.520
Look at me, I'm your boss.
Let me smell your hand.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.189
You might get a whiff
of onion in there, too.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.984
Oh, my God.
That smells so good.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.903
All right, I'm good.
Now I don't need to smoke.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.239
"Dad, I got a job!
I talk about giving head all day,

11:38.322 --> 11:40.116
and my boss makes me
let her smell my hand."

11:40.199 --> 11:42.952
Oh, you're just living the dream!

11:43.035 --> 11:46.163
All right. Your boss has
to ask a little favor of you.

11:46.872 --> 11:47.832
Yeah, whatever you want.

11:47.915 --> 11:51.001
We have to have Dr. Greg
on the show tomorrow.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.087
Gross, no! Why?

11:53.504 --> 11:56.590
I know he's kind of a dick.
It's not my favorite idea.

11:56.674 --> 12:01.429
"Kind of a dick"? He's a huge dick.
He treats me like I'm a total amateur.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.098
Which I sort of am,
but he acts like I'm not even a person. When we first met, he asked
who the president was when I was born

12:06.851 --> 12:09.770
and then when I said Clinton,
he just laughed and walked away.

12:09.854 --> 12:15.985
Look, I know that he's an asshole.
He is 100% an asshole,

12:16.068 --> 12:18.654
but he's going through a hard time,
and this might help him.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.574
-Nothing good.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.660
You're just gonna call your mom
and pretend to be pregnant again.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.079
Yeah, I guess that might be
getting kind of old.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.789
Please?

12:28.873 --> 12:32.668
Fine. If you really want to.
I guess it could be good.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.212
-Yes.
-You guys are gonna be fine.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.923
Do you even know what we're talking about?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.217
No, I tuned out.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.845
<i>Just as other millions</i>
<i>and quadrillions of atoms</i>

12:42.928 --> 12:48.976
<i>are the tiny building blocks which make up</i>
<i>everything in the world. Ships and...</i>

12:49.059 --> 12:50.728
Uh-huh.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.229
Just one sec. Sorry.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.148
It's 4:30. I think we're done.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.567
-It's 4:30.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.652
Yes. It is.

12:58.736 --> 13:02.364
Okay, um, class dismissed.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.450
I don't know what
you're working on that's so important,

13:04.533 --> 13:06.452
but I'm trying
to get into Brown over here.

13:06.535 --> 13:11.582
No. Yeah, no. I was just working
on lesson plans for next week.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.503
Really? 'Cause I can see
the reflection in your glasses

13:15.586 --> 13:17.254
and it definitely looks like a screenplay.

13:18.547 --> 13:23.260
Annie. You're vaping in class?
Jesus Christ! Come on.

13:23.344 --> 13:28.349
Sorry, class is over.
Thanks for not telling anyone. Bye.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.642
Okay. Bye.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.692
Hey. How are you feeling?

13:39.276 --> 13:42.446
I'm just tired. I just wanna sleep.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.407
Well... Hey, before you go,

13:45.491 --> 13:48.786
I just wanted to talk to you
about something real quick.

13:50.037 --> 13:56.001
Not a big deal. Just wanted
to ask you a little, teeny-tiny favor.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.170
Favor. Oh, fucking fuck!

13:58.963 --> 14:02.466
Okay. Well, you know I like to write,

14:03.008 --> 14:04.635
and I've been writing,

14:04.718 --> 14:08.097
and also been directing
something that I wrote.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.807
And it's really cool.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.142
It's kind of a thriller.

14:12.226 --> 14:16.355
Sort of like a dark,
erotic thriller kinda thing,

14:16.438 --> 14:21.402
and I was thinkin'
it'd be really fun and really cool

14:21.902 --> 14:23.404
if you had a part in it.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.323
You want me to play a part
in your erotic thriller?

14:26.407 --> 14:29.285
Well, it's not
an "erotic" erotic thriller.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.745
I mean, it's more just for adults.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.497
Oh, so it's an adult film?

14:33.581 --> 14:37.585
No, it's a movie for adults

14:37.668 --> 14:40.212
that's just a regular movie

14:40.296 --> 14:45.885
that I've put a lot of time and energy
and money into.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.596
Basically, emptied out my bank account.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.891
You're using your own money?
Gus, that's so sad.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.309
Well, yeah, I have to.

14:53.392 --> 14:57.021
I don't have any funding
or connections or whatever.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.814
I mean, you and me,
we're in the same boat.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.318
We're two people who had
to make our own luck,

15:02.401 --> 15:04.820
roll up our sleeves,
work hard to get the things we want.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.782
We're not like these guys who were born
on third and thought they hit a triple.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.953
I mean, you're a white guy
who I think is straight.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.997
You were at least born on second.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.582
That's true.

15:16.665 --> 15:19.168
That's a good point.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.463
Um... I guess I'm asking you

15:22.546 --> 15:27.426
'cause you're really the only person
who can help me out right now.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.887
Stop, stop. You're really
making me feel uncomfortable.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.139
I understand.

15:32.973 --> 15:37.102
I will do this one thing for you. Ever.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.940
This will be the one time
that I do something for you.

15:41.565 --> 15:45.402
Do you want this to be the one time
that I do something for you?

15:46.070 --> 15:49.990
Your one favor. There's a lot
of other things I could do for you.

15:50.074 --> 15:50.908
Right.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.702
-In the world.
-Mm-hmm.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.956
And you're choosing this.
Are you sure about that? -It's scary when you say--
-Yeah, I hope it's scary.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.502
I hope you're very scared

16:01.585 --> 16:03.337
because there's a lot
of other things I could do for you

16:03.420 --> 16:04.755
and this is what you're choosing.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.884
Okay.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.428
I mean, I'm confident...

16:11.512 --> 16:15.057
'Cause, you know what?
This is gonna be really cool.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.350
I'm sure of it.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.477
Is that sarcasm?

16:19.061 --> 16:19.895
No.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.082
-Hello. Hi.
-Hi!

16:40.874 --> 16:45.504
Sorry, I hope this isn't weird, but can I
please borrow some of your makeup?

16:45.587 --> 16:47.047
Why do you wanna borrow my makeup?

16:47.673 --> 16:51.802
You know, just to look a little bit nicer
and just amp myself up.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.680
Just something casual for daytime,
no big deal.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.473
Why, are you meeting a guy or something?

16:56.557 --> 17:00.310
-Oh, yes. But I have a boyfriend, so...
-Oh...

17:00.978 --> 17:02.229
Just friends meeting.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.733
Right. Okay. Lip gloss.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.359
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.987
-I'm 16.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.113
Oh.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.115
You're cool.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.993
I didn't get cool until way later.
So, good job.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.453
Oh, yeah

17:19.246 --> 17:22.958
I gotta tell ya,
I love the swag, by the way.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.044
-Oh, yeah, thanks.
-Your own condoms.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.839
I tried to get them
to make <i>Heart Work</i> mugs for me,

17:28.922 --> 17:31.842
-but they said it wasn't in the budget.
-Oh.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.552
Made one for myself, though.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.720
Are we ready?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.515
Hey, guys! It's me, Stella.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.436
And this week, we've got
a special guest. Dr. Greg Colter, who...

17:43.228 --> 17:44.938
He hosts <i>Heart Work </i>at Gravity,

17:45.022 --> 17:46.482
and he also just wrote a new book.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.733
Welcome, Greg.

17:47.816 --> 17:52.863
Thank you, Stella. Guess I'm here
to represent the male perspective.

17:52.946 --> 17:56.617
Right, 'cause society
needs more of that.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.619
Well, I actually think it does.

17:58.702 --> 18:03.165
I believe wholeheartedly
that men and women are equal,

18:03.248 --> 18:07.127
but, lately,
with the popularity of feminism,

18:07.211 --> 18:11.381
I do think that it has drowned out
some prominent male voices,

18:11.465 --> 18:12.966
and that is a real shame.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.426
Okay.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.805
Um, Dr. Greg is not a comedian
or performance artist.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.391
He is a professional therapist
who believes the words he's saying.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.644
-Let's take some calls.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.438
Hey, Sarah in Portland.
You're on with me

18:26.522 --> 18:29.483
and a man who believes men don't get
heard enough, Dr. Greg Colter.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.194
Hi.
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

18:32.277 --> 18:35.155
<i>So, I recently discovered</i>
<i>that I like being choked.</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:38.534
<i>During sex, not, like, in general. </i>
<i>Is that bad?</i>

18:38.617 --> 18:42.579
No. I mean, as long as you're safe
and with a partner that you trust,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.164
I think you should do
what makes you feel good.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.542
Don't be ashamed of who you are,
you fucking freak.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.544
Well, I totally disagree.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.838
Maybe you should feel weird about it.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.758
Because what is freaky
is not always what is healthy.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.927
Sometimes, self-harm is a cry for help.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.428
Oh, hold on a second.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.596
Life is hard.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.684
I think you should get yourself
a sweet orgasm any way you can.

19:03.767 --> 19:07.229
Don't listen to Dr. Greg Colter.
Actually, google Dr. Greg Colter.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.398
You can tell by his face
he has boring sex.

19:09.481 --> 19:13.318
Well, I've actually had
many adventurous experiences.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.906
I have experienced food play
many, many times.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.118
Uh... I'm into feet.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.998
I once orgasmed by giving cunnilingus.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.209
Amazing. Do we have another caller?

19:29.293 --> 19:32.504
Okay, so then, this guy,
way far stage right,

19:32.588 --> 19:34.256
pulls up a fucking rocket launcher.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.966
And he fires it.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.969
It goes across the entire stadium,
hits the Deacon

19:39.052 --> 19:41.388
and his entire body bursts into flames.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.974
-Good Lord!
-Yeah. Still fighting the whole time.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.021
And then, comes to the edge,
he's, like, so high up,

19:49.104 --> 19:53.358
and all of a sudden...
Falls. Like no big deal.

19:53.442 --> 19:59.072
Thirty feet easily, lands in the pool,
huge splash, and then... Awesome.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.868
Chris, I'm really proud of you.
I hope you get it. It's so cool.

20:02.951 --> 20:03.911
Oh, thanks. Me, too.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.537
What about you

20:05.621 --> 20:08.332
-I've been going back to Bar Body a bit.
-Cool.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.918
I went this morning, actually.
Did a whole class.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.837
And I did not vomit afterwards.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.132
Congratulations.
Not puking, very cool.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.219
Is your place far from here?
I could really use the bathroom.

20:20.886 --> 20:25.265
Oh, well, the public restroom
is right around the corner over there.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.308
Uh-huh.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.147
But that one's gross.
Come here, I'll show you my place.

20:33.565 --> 20:37.569
Yeah, so basically, think <i>Mad Max,</i>
although instead of sand, water.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.198
Ruby, Ruby, easy with the smoke, man.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.451
It's to keep the tone of the film.
It looks grainy, like...

20:44.534 --> 20:47.412
Yeah, but we talked about this.
This scene is lighter on smoke

20:47.496 --> 20:50.165
because Roman has clarity
and the audience has clarity.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.584
So the mise

20:52.668 --> 20:57.547
-No, that's what I was telling Wade.
-It looks like the school's on fire.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.424
-Okay.
-You'll see it in post.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.011
<i>I've been seeing this guy. </i>

21:03.095 --> 21:05.722
<i>He's successful and smart</i>
<i>and really nice, but--</i>

21:05.806 --> 21:08.558
-But you don't wanna fuck him.
<i>-I don't wanna fuck him.</i>

21:08.642 --> 21:09.476
Right.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.728
<i>Anyway, he's taking me out</i>
<i>to meet Lana Del Rey.</i>

21:11.812 --> 21:13.814
<i>He has a friend who's friends with her.</i>

21:13.897 --> 21:16.733
<i>Can I go even though </i>
<i>I'm not gonna date him or fuck him after?</i>

21:16.817 --> 21:19.903
Dude, yes! Totally go!
Your body, your choice.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.905
His Lana connection, his choice.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.240
What?

21:23.323 --> 21:26.285
Here's the advice, Amy.
Okay, you ready for it?

21:26.368 --> 21:29.288
Cancel the date,
or if you go, have sex with him.

21:29.371 --> 21:32.374
No, don't do that. She just said
she doesn't wanna have sex with him.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.167
I mean... Greg MD.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.754
-No, you can't call me Greg MD!

21:37.838 --> 21:41.258
Are you saying every time a guy
takes us out, we're obligated to fuck him?

21:41.341 --> 21:44.177
That's not what I'm saying.
Don't put words in my mouth here.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.556
Let me break it down, this whole thing,
what all of this is about.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.557
Please. I was--

21:48.640 --> 21:51.268
-Face the facts.
-I'm ready. Let's face them.

21:51.351 --> 21:54.229
Women use sex to manipulate men. Fact.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.899
I use sex for sexual pleasure.

21:57.983 --> 22:02.612
You've made that painfully obvious.
Of course, yeah, you love sex.

22:02.696 --> 22:07.159
Get it, good. But also, bullshit.
Sex got you famous.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.453
This asshole Amy from Hollywood

22:09.536 --> 22:12.581
is using her sexuality
to meet Lana Del Rey.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.542
Even your amazing producer here,
Mickey Dobbs,

22:15.625 --> 22:19.379
who's really been bringing in
the thought-provoking calls here,

22:19.463 --> 22:21.798
used me for sex, right?

22:21.882 --> 22:25.427
-Yeah. Hi, this is Mickey.

22:25.510 --> 22:29.431
Okay, I'm not ashamed
to admit it. We had sex.

22:29.514 --> 22:33.018
And it was gross.
And I wasn't manipulating you.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.021
Give me a break!
You led me on!

22:36.104 --> 22:39.149
You fucked me so that I wouldn't fire you.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.777
You probably slipped me Viagra
during lunch

22:41.860 --> 22:43.862
because I remember
getting harder than usual.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.448
Dr. Greg, moving on--

22:46.531 --> 22:51.119
Men are not necessarily the problem,
okay, Miss Feminist?

22:51.203 --> 22:55.957
Women are the fucking problem, too,
because you fuck us and you fuck with us!

22:56.041 --> 22:56.917
Here! You wanna fuck?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.419
-There you go. Fuck your life away!

22:59.503 --> 23:00.796
Fuck this!

23:01.963 --> 23:04.633
Dr. Greg just threw condoms
at my head, guys. This is real.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.927
He threw the chair down. He's leaving.

23:07.844 --> 23:10.806
And, action!

23:10.889 --> 23:13.266
Haley, I know you're scared.
We all are.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.478
But you have to tell me what you saw
before someone else gets killed.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.356
They threatened my family!
And what if I'm next?

23:19.439 --> 23:22.317
Haley, it's always better
to tell the truth.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.653
And what if the truth's not so simple?

23:25.904 --> 23:31.076
Well, I have time.
I'll listen. I'll protect you.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.870
Yeah! Cut!

23:33.954 --> 23:35.872
All right!

23:35.956 --> 23:38.333
Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.169
All right. Up top. Down low.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.171
Too slow. Okay. Great job, guys.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.216
Gus. Gus, I have a fuck up.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.510
The card is full.

23:49.427 --> 23:52.764
Oh, the card is full

23:52.848 --> 23:56.351
Okay, Mr. Prankster.
I didn't know we had a Mr. Clooney on set.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.728
No, it's just, my card...

23:59.771 --> 24:02.524
The card is full.
And so, we did not get the...

24:02.607 --> 24:04.234
Did you get any of the take?

24:04.901 --> 24:07.904
No. I got the first three seconds
and then...

24:07.988 --> 24:09.990
Okay, get a new card.
I don't care. Let's do it again.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.491
We got five minutes.
We'll do it again.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.410
I'll go out to my car.
It's in my car.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.162
You don't have the card here?

24:16.079 --> 24:18.081
-No. Yes.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.667
Then just wipe the card.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.295
Just wipe it clean, we'll start from
the beginning. We'll start from the...

24:23.378 --> 24:26.965
top.
The first five takes were shit anyway.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.550
I'm sorry, but they were.

24:28.633 --> 24:32.137
So now we're in a groove,
so we'll just wipe the card.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.305
We're gonna lose all those takes?

24:34.014 --> 24:34.848
One request.

24:34.931 --> 24:38.685
Can people care about this
as much as I fucking care?

24:40.395 --> 24:43.190
Wow, cool vibe on set, Michael Bay.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.984
Let's roll. Let's just roll.

24:46.943 --> 24:50.488
Yeah, and then they replaced two
of the treadmills with ellipticals.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.157
-Oh, that's crazy.

24:52.240 --> 24:57.621
It's just like Gus' place. Same weird art
on the walls and everything.

24:57.704 --> 25:01.708
Yeah. Well, actually, there's
a couple small differences...

25:01.791 --> 25:03.084
Uh, my microwave broke.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.963
So, they came and replaced it,
and this one is top of the line.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.089
That's cool.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.009
So if you ever need to microwave anything,
don't go to Gus'.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.135
I won't.

25:12.219 --> 25:16.389
Oh, check this out. I wanted to know
what the meaning of this painting was,

25:16.473 --> 25:19.392
so I found the artist on Facebook
and reached out.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.769
He got back to me in two seconds. What was the meaning?

25:23.063 --> 25:27.234
Um... No meaning.
Just that, it was just dots.

25:27.317 --> 25:30.779
Yeah, he, um, likes dots.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.031
Do you need to use the bathroom?

25:34.157 --> 25:35.700
No.

25:41.414 --> 25:44.251
-You're very physically capable.
-I'm a stuntman.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.877
That's so fucking hot.

25:48.421 --> 25:51.424
Excuse me. We had a lunch break on set,

25:51.508 --> 25:54.678
all these buildings look alike,
but <i>Witchita </i>is that way, right?

25:55.679 --> 25:59.933
The <i>Witchita </i>set is that way, right?
I'm supposed to be there now, so...

26:00.934 --> 26:03.019
<i>Witchita </i>set.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.063
Is that the zombie cart?

26:05.146 --> 26:09.442
Hey! Hey, excuse me. Zombie cart, hold on.
I'm supposed to be on the cart. We are living in a very sensitive time,

26:13.905 --> 26:18.868
and we need to be mindful
of hateful, sexist rhetoric.

26:18.952 --> 26:19.786
Agreed.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.580
The whole point was
to have a very frank discussion

26:22.664 --> 26:24.833
about gender and sexuality.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.627
-You cannot throw condoms at a co-worker.
-I was building to that.

26:27.711 --> 26:31.548
You cannot call out a co-worker's
sexual history on live radio.

26:31.631 --> 26:32.632
Also true.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.135
And you cannot verbally abuse
our subscribers.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.429
So, what happens now?

26:40.181 --> 26:42.976
-You're suspended until further notice.
Wow.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.772
I have devoted 15 years of my life
to helping people.

26:47.856 --> 26:52.652
I've been at Gravity since the beginning.
How am I supposed to pay my mortgage?

26:52.736 --> 26:55.155
-You rent. You don't have a mortgage.
-It's a figure of speech.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.574
Hey, just keep a cool head here.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.700
Sorry.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.494
I'll call you as soon as I know
what we're gonna do, all right?

27:01.578 --> 27:03.330
Rick is gonna escort you out.

27:05.623 --> 27:08.168
Bet you couldn't be happier
about this, huh?

27:08.251 --> 27:10.337
-Yeah.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.713
I tried to fucking help you.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.591
Oh, my fucking God.
-It's not my fault he fucked himself.

27:14.674 --> 27:19.971
Okay. Okay. We have no choice.
I'm sorry, Greg.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.476
It's "Dr. Greg."

27:28.229 --> 27:29.564
Let's go, Rick.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.951
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I got it, buddy.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.622
Thanks. Thanks, man.

27:45.705 --> 27:49.125
-Yeah, great day. It was a great day.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.044
-Oh, I got it. I got it.

27:51.127 --> 27:52.087
Yeah, it's cool.

28:01.012 --> 28:04.015
-Yep.

28:06.434 --> 28:11.940
And, hey, Ruby, you know, as far as that
card stuff goes, like, shit happens.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.358
I guess so.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.610
All right.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.406
Got that scene though, huh?

28:20.115 --> 28:21.616
Yeah, rock on.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.042
Stay cool.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.335
Stay cool.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.754
Stay cool.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.681
Chris.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.142
Chris.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.061
We fell asleep.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.579
You're very good at sex.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.082
What was his face like?

29:12.625 --> 29:14.711
Uh... Sad?

29:14.794 --> 29:17.046
Who got to be there?
You, Erika...

29:17.130 --> 29:18.256
Yeah, me and Erika.

29:18.339 --> 29:22.260
I hate his Andre Agassi haircut.
It's, like, weak genes or something.

29:23.428 --> 29:27.098
I just want more specifics. It's not fair
that I didn't get to watch him leave.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.516
Yes, tell us more.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.811
I don't know, he just seemed broken.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.190
People should throw more tantrums at work.
I would show up more often.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.233
This is the best day
of my professional career.

29:37.317 --> 29:40.278
I've only been in the workforce
for, like, two months, but still.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.864
-I'm gonna smoke.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.033
Oh, my God, Truman.
Hey, will you watch for roofies?

29:45.116 --> 29:46.951
-Yes.
Sorry, Mickey.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.245
No, it's cool.
I'm with you guys in spirit.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.465
Hey, could I get a vodka tonic?

30:00.548 --> 30:01.800
Yeah, sure thing. Never mind. I'm good.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.536
-Yeah, hey!

30:29.619 --> 30:32.956
The park doesn't open for 20 minutes
so I can run you through a couple moves.

30:33.039 --> 30:36.042
Yeah, man. I'm all yours.
