Previously on <i>Smash</i>.

00:05.252 --> 00:07.344
You're waiting to much time
to be in the ensemble.

00:07.345 --> 00:09.014
What, this brilliant director
is that powerful?

00:09.065 --> 00:11.233
You couldn't even say,
"sorry, I need a minute"?

00:11.267 --> 00:12.851
They're looking at someone
else for press secretary.

00:12.885 --> 00:15.637
Do they have you
in a little blonde wig

00:15.655 --> 00:17.389
- and a skirt that blows up?
- Okay...

00:17.423 --> 00:18.824
We haven't met yet.
I'm Tom.

00:18.858 --> 00:20.659
- I'm Sam.
- You slept with my wife.

00:20.693 --> 00:23.478
I made a terrible mistake.
Please don't go!

00:23.496 --> 00:24.913
How's <i>Marilyn</i> doing?

00:24.947 --> 00:26.681
She's having
some growing pains.

00:26.716 --> 00:29.251
If we land Rebecca Duvall,
I want a co-producer credit.

00:29.285 --> 00:32.170
Chasing after movie stars,
it's so lame.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.956
- Why can't the song be the star?
- Why can't I be the star?

00:52.103 --> 00:54.271
What happens
if she doesn't show up?

00:54.332 --> 00:55.999
You're still angling
for that part.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.334
Why wouldn't I?

00:59.637 --> 01:01.638
We have a bit of a problem.

01:01.672 --> 01:02.923
Okay.

01:02.974 --> 01:04.674
As many of you
may have suspected,

01:04.708 --> 01:06.893
our star
is somewhat delayed,

01:06.928 --> 01:08.628
so why don't we
take a ten,

01:08.663 --> 01:12.149
and then we'll restart
with the design presentation.

01:14.352 --> 01:16.153
She's not even here?

01:16.187 --> 01:18.071
I mean, we know
she's not here,

01:18.106 --> 01:19.739
but she's not
in New York?

01:19.774 --> 01:22.442
- She's in Cuba.
- Cuba?

01:22.493 --> 01:25.112
- Eileen.
- Manny.

01:25.163 --> 01:31.001
- Can we have a moment?
- Of course we can.

01:31.035 --> 01:36.456
Okay, so I talk loud.
He was going to find out anyway.

01:36.507 --> 01:38.592
This was just
a brief travel hiccup.

01:38.626 --> 01:40.127
The plane was canceled.
It happens.

01:40.178 --> 01:43.130
Eileen, let me make
one thing clear.

01:43.181 --> 01:45.182
Just because we say we're in
doesn't mean the money is.

01:45.216 --> 01:47.851
That'll show
when miss Duvall shows.

01:47.885 --> 01:50.804
You've got two days,
then we're pulling out.

01:50.855 --> 01:54.441
Hold the elevator.

02:05.736 --> 02:08.538
I just heard.

02:08.573 --> 02:11.124
Yeah, it's official.
Denby got the job,

02:11.159 --> 02:13.376
which makes him my boss.

02:13.411 --> 02:14.828
How did this happen?

02:14.879 --> 02:17.214
That stuff we had on him
was appalling.

02:17.248 --> 02:18.465
Never made it past
the chief of staff.

02:18.499 --> 02:22.002
He buried it.

02:22.053 --> 02:26.256
- It should've been you.
- Yeah.

02:28.342 --> 02:32.395
- What did Karen say?
- Haven't told her.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.235
Why would she go to Cuba?

02:38.269 --> 02:41.104
Some goodwill mission
with Sean Penn.

02:41.138 --> 02:43.823
Okay, I can't lose the day.
We have to start work.

02:43.858 --> 02:47.861
But we need to do
something first, come on.

02:50.081 --> 02:52.115
Karen,
I need to talk to you.

02:52.149 --> 02:54.751
What's up?

02:54.785 --> 02:57.120
Look, because miss Duvall's
entrance has been delayed,

02:57.154 --> 02:58.622
we need to look
at some staging issues.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.457
- Okay.
- We want you to do it.

03:00.491 --> 03:02.209
You want...

03:02.260 --> 03:03.577
We want you
to understudy Marilyn.

03:03.611 --> 03:04.794
Are you up for that?

03:04.829 --> 03:07.681
Yes, sure. Yes.

03:07.715 --> 03:10.383
Great, but we're gonna hit
the ground running. Linda?

03:10.418 --> 03:12.435
- Two more, Derek.
- See you in two.

03:12.470 --> 03:14.137
Okay.

03:14.171 --> 03:15.972
- My God.
- What did she say?

03:16.006 --> 03:18.391
- I'm the understudy.
- My God.

03:18.426 --> 03:23.280
That is so amazing!

03:24.848 --> 03:26.483
My gosh,
congratulations!

03:26.517 --> 03:29.035
She is never going
to be able to hack it.

03:29.070 --> 03:31.238
Especially after Ivy
breaks her kneecaps.

03:32.790 --> 03:35.242
Every musical theater actress
in this city

03:35.293 --> 03:36.243
is dying
to play that part,

03:36.294 --> 03:37.627
and they end up giving it

03:37.662 --> 03:38.628
to someone
who doesn't even show.

03:40.665 --> 03:42.048
It's not funny, Sam,
it's tragic.

03:42.083 --> 03:45.585
Yeah, no...
This is tragic.

03:45.636 --> 03:48.004
Come on, Rebecca Duvall's
never looked better.

03:50.675 --> 03:53.175
Wait, wait, wait,
you have to see the other ones.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.730
Didn't expect to hear you
laughing about it.

03:56.764 --> 04:00.600
About what?

04:00.651 --> 04:01.851
You didn't tell her,
did you?

04:01.886 --> 04:03.770
- Tell me what?
- Yeah...

04:03.804 --> 04:05.572
I'm gonna leave that
to Derek.

04:05.606 --> 04:07.691
I'll see you later, Ive.

04:07.725 --> 04:11.361
Goodbye, Sam.

04:13.230 --> 04:14.631
Tell me what?

04:14.665 --> 04:19.302
Karen's going
to understudy Marilyn.

04:19.337 --> 04:20.870
Karen?

04:20.904 --> 04:23.423
Yeah, well, she already knows
half the blocking.

04:23.457 --> 04:25.759
I know all the blocking...

04:25.793 --> 04:26.960
She is...

04:26.994 --> 04:30.330
She's...
Little usurper.

04:30.364 --> 04:32.632
Ivy, after what happened
at <i>Heaven on Earth</i>,

04:32.667 --> 04:33.883
I can't even get you
in the chorus.

04:33.918 --> 04:36.686
- You know that.
- I was upset.

04:36.721 --> 04:37.804
I was a mess
after what happened.

04:37.855 --> 04:40.607
Nevertheless...

04:45.095 --> 04:46.396
It's not funny.

04:46.430 --> 04:47.897
Yeah, it is, actually.

04:47.931 --> 04:52.402
That is pretty funny.

05:11.677 --> 05:13.945
<i>Gracias. Adios.</i>

05:13.979 --> 05:17.532
- Who was that?
- Castro's brother, Raul.

05:17.566 --> 05:19.033
- Really?
- Of course not.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.485
Don't be ridiculous.

05:20.519 --> 05:21.669
Well, what happened?
Where's Rebecca?

05:21.704 --> 05:23.187
You're the one
who secured her.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.423
You want co-producer credit?
Go find her.

05:25.457 --> 05:28.643
- I...
- And while you're at it,

05:28.677 --> 05:30.845
set up a meeting
with our antsy investors.

05:30.879 --> 05:32.864
I need to let
the natives know

05:32.898 --> 05:35.717
there's no longer
a reason to be restless.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.138
Surprise.

05:40.172 --> 05:41.856
You are a sight
for sore eyes.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.708
- I have news.
- So do I.

05:43.742 --> 05:45.026
Come on, you first.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.195
Okay.
Movie star didn't show up.

05:47.229 --> 05:48.863
- That's bad, isn't it?
- Not this time.

05:48.897 --> 05:50.982
I got a promotion.
I'm the understudy.

05:51.033 --> 05:55.820
And since there's no movie star,
for now, I'm Marilyn.

05:57.239 --> 05:58.740
Sundaram...

05:58.774 --> 06:02.226
- Sorry.
- Paul, what do you need?

06:02.261 --> 06:04.345
- This is your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.497
- Karen Cartwright.
- Young Marilyn.

06:06.548 --> 06:10.201
We've met.
Good to see you again.

06:10.235 --> 06:15.223
Stop by my office
when you get a minute, okay?

06:15.257 --> 06:20.595
He's such a weasel.
What was your news?

06:20.629 --> 06:24.515
Doesn't matter.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.686
He had his own key
to her apartment?

06:28.737 --> 06:30.571
So other than
her questionable taste in men,

06:30.606 --> 06:32.023
how is she?

06:32.074 --> 06:33.358
She's tougher than she looks,
you know.

06:33.409 --> 06:35.159
But she's going
to need a job soon.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.244
After what happened
at <i>Heaven on Earth?</i>

06:36.278 --> 06:37.528
It's not going to be easy.

06:37.579 --> 06:38.997
The whole town
is talking about it.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.999
Yeah, <i>schadenfreude</i>
as art form.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.867
Tom,
should we go in or...?

06:42.918 --> 06:44.252
We'll have a good time.

06:44.286 --> 06:46.671
- I hear it's a train wreck.
- Right?

06:46.705 --> 06:48.122
Why are we going?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.174
'Cause it's a train wreck.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.593
- See you at rehearsal.
- Bye.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.601
You like it?

07:00.636 --> 07:03.054
Mom, it's grilled cheese.

07:03.105 --> 07:05.356
But is it
a good grilled cheese?

07:05.391 --> 07:09.560
It's fantastic.

07:11.146 --> 07:15.033
Have you seen him?

07:15.067 --> 07:17.318
He asked me
not to tell you.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.737
- You have.
- Mom, please.

07:19.788 --> 07:22.907
- I can't be the one...
- No, I know. I know.

07:22.958 --> 07:26.828
I'm not.
I... sorry.

07:26.862 --> 07:30.848
- We're gonna be fine.
- I know.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.939
<i>Trying hard
to reach out</i>

07:54.990 --> 07:57.075
<i>But when I tried
to speak out</i>

07:57.109 --> 08:01.195
<i>Felt like
no one could hear me</i>

08:01.229 --> 08:03.664
<i>Wanted to belong here</i>

08:03.699 --> 08:06.250
<i>but something feels
so wrong here</i>

08:06.285 --> 08:09.337
<i>So I pray</i>

08:09.371 --> 08:13.908
<i>I can breakaway</i>

08:17.179 --> 08:21.466
<i>I'll spread my wings
and I'll learn how to fly</i>

08:21.517 --> 08:26.637
<i>I'll do what it takes
till I touch the sky</i>

08:26.688 --> 08:28.973
<i>And I'll make a wish
take a chance</i>

08:29.024 --> 08:30.391
<i>Make a change</i>

08:30.425 --> 08:35.279
<i>and breakaway</i>

08:35.313 --> 08:39.817
<i>out of the darkness
and into the sun</i>

08:39.868 --> 08:42.570
<i>But I won't forget
all the ones that I love</i>

08:42.604 --> 08:46.624
<i>And I'll take a risk
take a chance</i>

08:46.658 --> 08:48.376
<i>Make a change</i>

08:48.410 --> 08:53.297
<i>and breakaway</i>

08:53.332 --> 08:55.800
<i>buildings with
a hundred floors</i>

08:55.834 --> 08:58.219
<i>Swinging 'round
revolving doors</i>

08:58.253 --> 09:02.540
<i>Baby I don't know
where they'll take me</i>

09:02.574 --> 09:05.977
<i>But gotta keep moving on
moving on</i>

09:06.011 --> 09:11.265
<i>Fly away

09:11.299 --> 09:15.903
<i>I'll spread my wings
and I'll learn how to fly</i>

09:15.938 --> 09:19.941
<i>Though it's not easy
to tell you goodbye</i>

09:19.975 --> 09:21.576
<i>Gotta take a risk</i>

09:21.610 --> 09:25.496
<i>take a chance
make a change</i>

09:25.531 --> 09:28.916
<i>And breakaway</i>

09:28.951 --> 09:34.539
<i>breakaway</i>

09:39.428 --> 09:41.629
Rebecca's assistant's having
some trouble getting her visa.

09:41.663 --> 09:43.931
- Her assistant?
- Well, she's Cuban.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.349
It's political.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.101
Rebecca can't
leave the girl behind.

09:47.135 --> 09:48.886
So I'm on it.

09:48.937 --> 09:51.022
But for now, you're going
to have to continue staging

09:51.056 --> 09:52.473
without your star.

09:52.507 --> 09:55.393
Karen Cartwright!

09:55.444 --> 09:58.029
Eileen,
she's a movie star

09:58.063 --> 09:59.614
who has never
done live theater.

09:59.648 --> 10:00.698
She has a lot of work
ahead of her.

10:00.732 --> 10:02.233
We need her yesterday.

10:02.284 --> 10:07.238
And she'll be here
by the weekend, okay?

10:07.289 --> 10:09.123
A... aren't you
forgetting something?

10:09.157 --> 10:12.543
- Am I?
- Alan Rykoff, NYU.

10:12.578 --> 10:16.564
Tell me
that's not today.

10:16.598 --> 10:18.266
You like this, Arthur?

10:18.300 --> 10:19.584
I do, yeah.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.885
It's crap,
men in dresses.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.503
Who's going to pay
to see that?

10:22.538 --> 10:24.922
Cross-dressing in the theatre
has a long history,

10:24.973 --> 10:26.307
all the way
back to the Greeks...

10:26.341 --> 10:27.925
No, no, no,
downstage, Karen.

10:27.976 --> 10:30.611
- Downstage!
- Downstage what?

10:30.646 --> 10:33.064
You cross downstage
of your scene partner

10:33.098 --> 10:34.815
so that when he stands up,

10:34.850 --> 10:36.567
he doesn't put his bloody back
to the bloody audience.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.069
We've just done this.
Didn't you write it down?

10:38.103 --> 10:39.654
No, I...

10:39.688 --> 10:41.656
Can we have a pencil,
please, for miss Cartwright?

10:41.690 --> 10:43.741
Since she can't remember
the simplest piece of blocking.

10:43.775 --> 10:47.245
You cross <i>downstage</i>
of Arthur.

10:47.279 --> 10:50.865
Can you even spell
"downstage"?

10:50.899 --> 10:53.751
And I thought he was evil
during the workshop.

10:53.785 --> 10:56.621
Would it be more evil
to start taking bets?

10:56.672 --> 10:57.838
On what?

10:57.873 --> 10:59.040
Whether or not
he makes her cry.

10:59.074 --> 11:02.176
Evil.

11:02.210 --> 11:03.511
Ten bucks,
she folds like a tent.

11:03.545 --> 11:05.963
- $20, she gets fired.
- You're on.

11:06.014 --> 11:07.882
So, according to Wikipedia,

11:07.916 --> 11:11.385
you guys have been writing
partners for ten years.

11:11.419 --> 11:12.887
That sounds about right.

11:12.921 --> 11:15.890
And you have a ritual
around the anniversary

11:15.924 --> 11:18.309
of your first opening night
together.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.644
Could you describe that
for me?

11:19.678 --> 11:22.446
Isn't it on Wikipedia?

11:22.481 --> 11:25.316
On our anniversary,
every year,

11:25.367 --> 11:28.619
we find a production
of <i>Three on a match</i> somewhere,

11:28.654 --> 11:30.805
and we go to see it.

11:30.839 --> 11:33.708
So this is sort of like
a wedding anniversary for you.

11:33.742 --> 11:37.044
We get each other
gifts and everything.

11:37.079 --> 11:38.245
Does your husband
get jealous?

11:38.279 --> 11:40.715
No. No!
Why would you say that?

11:40.749 --> 11:44.669
I just meant
that he has to share you.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.171
With me.

11:47.222 --> 11:50.541
No, Frank's not like that.

11:50.575 --> 11:53.377
Is there anything else?

11:53.412 --> 11:56.230
Sorry. I'm sorry
to cut this short.

11:56.264 --> 11:58.065
It's just, we have...
We're just so busy today.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.567
- I'm sure you...
- Of course.

11:59.601 --> 12:03.237
The entire town
is buzzing over <i>Bombshell,</i>

12:03.271 --> 12:07.191
especially now that Rebecca
Duvall is playing the part.

12:14.199 --> 12:16.250
He's, like, screaming at me,
because, for one second,

12:16.284 --> 12:18.369
I forgot my stupid pencil.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.755
You think he could fire me?

12:20.789 --> 12:23.391
No. Next time,
don't forget your pencil.

12:23.425 --> 12:25.509
That was helpful.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.011
Yeah, well,
you don't like the guy.

12:27.045 --> 12:29.130
- You never did.
- Why should I?

12:29.164 --> 12:32.516
He sexually harassed me
the first day I met him.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.769
What?
He what?

12:36.271 --> 12:38.806
"Oh"?
"Oh" what?

12:38.840 --> 12:40.474
"I didn't tell you
that part"?

12:40.508 --> 12:41.892
- It wasn't a big deal.
- What, being sexually harassed

12:41.943 --> 12:43.310
now is officially
not a big deal?

12:43.344 --> 12:45.062
I handled it.
He made a pass and I handled it.

12:45.113 --> 12:46.447
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling at you.

12:46.481 --> 12:47.531
Feels like
you're yelling at me.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.150
Well, if I am
yelling at you,

12:49.184 --> 12:50.534
I'd have a right to maybe,
because you lied to me.

12:50.569 --> 12:52.069
- I didn't lie to you.
- You did.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.604
Well, because you'd be upset,
which you are.

12:53.638 --> 12:54.989
Upset because
you're being sexually harassed

12:55.023 --> 12:56.791
and putting up with it?
Damn right I am.

12:56.825 --> 12:58.709
Look, I... ugh,
I got yelled at all day.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.795
I'm not gonna just sit here
and get yelled at again.

13:00.829 --> 13:02.496
I have to be rested so I can get
yelled at again tomorrow.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.131
What,
you're just going back there?

13:04.166 --> 13:05.916
Yeah, I'm going back there.
Are you insane?

13:05.967 --> 13:08.302
- Karen...
- Yell at somebody else, Dev.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.170
I need a few more days.

13:15.399 --> 13:18.118
But Rebecca will be here.
When exactly?

13:18.152 --> 13:21.171
Sunday at the latest.
You have my word.

13:21.206 --> 13:23.257
Assuming, once she gets here,
we can sit down with her.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.508
Or at least
with her representatives.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.176
No, with her too.

13:26.211 --> 13:30.264
This is $7 million
we're talking about, Eileen.

13:30.298 --> 13:33.300
All this back and forth
doesn't inspire confidence.

13:33.351 --> 13:34.835
Hang on, hang on.

13:34.869 --> 13:36.470
Robyn has a point.

13:36.521 --> 13:38.856
I feel a little blindsided
by all this.

13:38.890 --> 13:40.374
Well, this is
hardly unprecedented.

13:40.408 --> 13:41.808
It's not unprecedented

13:41.860 --> 13:43.627
that she doesn't
show up at all either.

13:43.661 --> 13:45.229
I want to meet
with your director, as well.

13:45.263 --> 13:48.682
All this because an actress
is a few days late?

13:48.716 --> 13:51.568
No one can force you
to take our money, Eileen.

13:51.602 --> 13:56.540
Jerry would never have
put us in this situation.

14:04.115 --> 14:07.801
Two Martinis and you haven't
flirted with me once.

14:07.835 --> 14:10.337
It's not that kind of night.

14:10.371 --> 14:13.507
What's going on?

14:13.541 --> 14:16.760
It's just these vultures
I'm having to deal with.

14:16.794 --> 14:20.814
My so-called investors.
"Socalled"?

14:20.848 --> 14:23.817
They don't want
to invest in Marilyn.

14:23.851 --> 14:25.519
They want to invest
in a movie star,

14:25.570 --> 14:27.271
and I admit,
I opened the door to that,

14:27.305 --> 14:29.690
because you have to,
but God...

14:29.724 --> 14:33.010
- It's a galling business.
- Why put up with it?

14:33.044 --> 14:36.663
They have the money.
They sign the checks.

14:36.698 --> 14:38.682
It's the way
the game is played.

14:38.716 --> 14:39.950
Does it have to be?

14:39.984 --> 14:43.086
I'm open to suggestions.

14:52.764 --> 14:54.881
Emergency fund.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.684
A bar's got to stay liquid
more ways than one in this city.

14:57.719 --> 15:01.555
Well, this is...
Very impressive.

15:01.589 --> 15:04.441
And incredibly sweet.

15:04.475 --> 15:07.611
Got $7 million
under there?

15:07.645 --> 15:10.530
Kitty's a little short
of $7 million.

15:10.565 --> 15:12.032
But I do have friends.

15:12.066 --> 15:17.204
What kind of friends?

15:17.238 --> 15:18.739
So they finally came up
with a number

15:18.790 --> 15:19.823
that doesn't
have Marilyn in it?

15:21.359 --> 15:24.211
Daryl Zanuck and his execs
in his steam room.

15:24.245 --> 15:26.780
That's right, he used to make
them take meetings in there.

15:26.814 --> 15:28.465
Yep, it's all men.

15:28.499 --> 15:31.251
It's about the only thing
I can stage right now.

15:31.302 --> 15:33.770
You have an understudy.
Why aren't you staging on her?

15:33.805 --> 15:37.724
Darling,
I would if it was you.

15:37.759 --> 15:39.726
She's like a scared rabbit
out there.

15:39.761 --> 15:41.762
She's completely useless.

15:41.813 --> 15:43.748
You should
take it easy on her.

15:44.382 --> 15:45.483
Excuse me?

15:45.517 --> 15:47.684
The only directors who were
ever successful with Marilyn

15:47.718 --> 15:49.603
were the ones
who babied her.

15:49.654 --> 15:51.321
The rest of the time,
she just shut down.

15:51.356 --> 15:52.973
Well, I didn't baby you.

15:53.007 --> 15:55.025
No, you fired me.

15:55.059 --> 15:56.960
And that's okay, Derek.

15:56.995 --> 16:00.847
I'm just saying,
there's a lot on the line.

16:00.882 --> 16:03.316
You need to be smart.

16:03.351 --> 16:05.085
I think
I'm plenty smart.

16:05.119 --> 16:09.506
I think you could be smarter.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.458
Well, I think
I'm pretty smart.

16:31.095 --> 16:32.863
Okay, dancers
for the Zanuck number, please.

16:32.897 --> 16:35.365
Derek, we added towels
to help sell the fact

16:35.400 --> 16:37.451
that Zanuck had all his meetings
in the steam room.

16:37.485 --> 16:40.404
Okay.
Where's Zanuck?

16:40.438 --> 16:41.988
You don't want to know.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.041
He'll be back tomorrow.

16:44.075 --> 16:48.462
I'm standing in today.

16:48.496 --> 16:50.330
I live in
a world of stand-ins.

16:50.381 --> 16:53.750
Okay, let 'er rip.

16:53.784 --> 16:55.502
Any idea why Zanuck's
turning the heat up on us again?

16:55.553 --> 16:57.387
Search me.
I think it's Monroe,

16:57.422 --> 17:00.590
but it's not like
I get paid to think.

17:00.624 --> 17:02.893
<i>A studio executive</i>

17:02.927 --> 17:05.679
<i>has no beliefs</i>

17:05.730 --> 17:10.934
<i>that's the way
of the studio system</i>

17:10.968 --> 17:15.355
<i>We've bowed to every rear
of all the studio chiefs</i>

17:15.388 --> 17:19.826
<i>And you can bet your ass
we've kissed 'em</i>

17:19.861 --> 17:23.997
<i>Even the birds
in the Hollywood hills</i>

17:24.031 --> 17:29.002
<i>Know the secret
to our success</i>

17:29.036 --> 17:33.623
<i>It's those magical words
that pay the bills</i>

17:33.657 --> 17:36.259
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

17:36.294 --> 17:38.261
<i>and yes</i>

17:38.296 --> 17:40.380
- My God.
- That's him.

17:40.431 --> 17:42.215
Here he comes.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.518
- Good morning, Mr. Zanuck.
- Good morning, Mr. Zanuck.

17:44.552 --> 17:45.936
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:45.970 --> 17:47.938
Gentlemen, take a memo.

17:47.972 --> 17:50.223
<i>Today the trades
are all aglow</i>

17:50.258 --> 17:52.025
<i>With grosses
for our miss Monroe</i>

17:52.059 --> 17:53.643
<i>The things
those vermin mustn't know</i>

17:53.677 --> 17:55.278
<i>Is what
she puts us through</i>

17:55.313 --> 17:57.030
<i>She makes directors
wait all day</i>

17:57.064 --> 17:58.899
<i>One line per hour's
all she'll say</i>

17:58.950 --> 18:00.534
<i>And still she thinks
we're gonna pay?</i>

18:00.568 --> 18:02.152
<i>She needs a talking to</i>

18:02.186 --> 18:05.906
<i>tomatoes like her must
be put in their place</i>

18:05.957 --> 18:08.325
<i>If she don't shape up soon,
she'll soon be walking</i>

18:08.359 --> 18:10.410
<i>'Cause the buck
stops with me</i>

18:10.461 --> 18:13.046
<i>yes, you're right
we agree</i>

18:13.080 --> 18:15.999
<i>Uh, don't say yes
until I've finished talking</i>

18:16.033 --> 18:17.667
<i>She's got them all
tied up in knots</i>

18:17.701 --> 18:19.336
<i>Makes each producer
faint and plotz</i>

18:19.370 --> 18:20.837
<i>She thinks she's queen
and calls the shots</i>

18:20.871 --> 18:23.306
<i>As she sits
on her throne</i>

18:23.341 --> 18:24.975
<i>She needs to learn
she's only skin</i>

18:25.009 --> 18:26.476
<i>The next girl's
waiting for a spin</i>

18:26.511 --> 18:27.811
<i>I made a star
of rin-tin-tin</i>

18:27.845 --> 18:28.929
<i>And paid him
with a bone</i>

18:28.980 --> 18:31.731
<i>tomatoes like her</i>

18:31.766 --> 18:33.767
<i>well, they're easy to find</i>

18:33.818 --> 18:36.186
<i>we throw them out as soon
as they start squawking</i>

18:36.220 --> 18:37.904
<i>So get me
some younger dish</i>

18:37.939 --> 18:39.906
<i>we concur
as you wish</i>

18:39.941 --> 18:43.360
<i>Hey, don't say yes
until I've finished talking</i>

18:43.394 --> 18:45.162
<i>And while you've got me
on a roll</i>

18:45.196 --> 18:46.746
<i>Let's find a role
for nat king Cole</i>

18:46.781 --> 18:48.698
<i>Tell Mankiewicz
his script is trite</i>

18:48.732 --> 18:50.333
<i>A little lower
to the right</i>

18:50.368 --> 18:51.868
<i>I think that
Brando is miscast</i>

18:51.902 --> 18:53.370
<i>That television
just won't last</i>

18:53.404 --> 18:55.338
<i>That I'm the king
of Hollywood</i>

18:55.373 --> 18:57.374
<i>all hail the king!
Oh, that feels good</i>

18:57.408 --> 18:59.092
<i>which brings me back
to that dumb blonde</i>

18:59.126 --> 19:00.760
<i>To her demands
I now respond</i>

19:00.795 --> 19:02.212
<i>Some buy your act
but I'm not conned</i>

19:02.246 --> 19:03.880
<i>You'd better
fall in line</i>

19:03.914 --> 19:05.549
<i>You're two basooms
and nuts to boot</i>

19:05.583 --> 19:07.384
<i>I'll keep you
in a bathing suit</i>

19:07.418 --> 19:09.052
<i>When you stop
bringing in the loot</i>

19:09.086 --> 19:10.687
<i>We'll go back
to the vine</i>

19:10.721 --> 19:12.439
<i>tomatoes like you</i>

19:12.473 --> 19:14.191
<i>they all wither and die</i>

19:14.225 --> 19:16.726
<i>my powers, though,
will never be diminished</i>

19:16.760 --> 19:19.446
<i>So don't bring me
to my boiling point</i>

19:19.480 --> 19:21.114
<i>You're just a broad
I own the joint</i>

19:21.148 --> 19:22.949
<i>I'm in control
you're just a face</i>

19:22.984 --> 19:24.618
<i>Allow me to cut
to the chase</i>

19:24.652 --> 19:26.203
<i>I'll make
another movie star</i>

19:26.237 --> 19:27.787
<i>Could someone light
my damn cigar?</i>

19:27.822 --> 19:29.389
<i>And then say yes
'cause yes, men</i>

19:29.423 --> 19:30.957
<i>I'm finished</i>

19:30.992 --> 19:32.375
Yes!

19:32.410 --> 19:35.128
Yeah, that'll do.

19:35.162 --> 19:37.664
You make
a lovely Zanuck, Tom.

19:37.715 --> 19:40.083
Thank you.

19:40.117 --> 19:41.551
Karen...

19:41.586 --> 19:43.503
Do you have a pencil?

19:43.554 --> 19:45.222
- Yes, I do.
- Terrific.

19:45.256 --> 19:47.173
Come with me.
Off to the break room.

19:47.225 --> 19:48.808
We're gonna run the transition
<i>Let me be your star,</i>

19:48.843 --> 19:50.060
straight through
the playboy shoot,

19:50.094 --> 19:51.344
and into Johnny Hyde.

19:51.395 --> 19:53.346
Okay, now this
is gonna move fast,

19:53.397 --> 19:55.265
so just do
exactly what I say,

19:55.299 --> 19:56.683
and when you've got it,
write it down,

19:56.734 --> 19:58.568
and that'll be
a huge help to me.

19:58.603 --> 20:00.654
I know we're dropping you
into the deep end.

20:00.688 --> 20:05.108
- I can do it.
- Yeah, I know you can.

20:05.142 --> 20:06.693
I'm counting on it.

20:06.744 --> 20:10.313
Okay, that's lunch.

20:14.485 --> 20:16.953
Think he only has
a week to live?

20:16.987 --> 20:18.288
Maybe
he found the Lord.

20:18.322 --> 20:19.589
I've seen this
kind of behavior before

20:19.624 --> 20:21.841
in stroke victims.

20:21.876 --> 20:23.126
Maybe he had a stroke.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.796
Shush.

20:33.916 --> 20:37.399
A less guy who want to invest
in a Broadway musical because...?

20:37.433 --> 20:39.485
One smile
from you, Eileen,

20:39.536 --> 20:42.454
and my man won't know
what hit him.

20:42.489 --> 20:46.325
Meet Randy Cobra,
in the flesh.

20:46.376 --> 20:47.826
Randy!

20:47.877 --> 20:48.827
Nick, what's happening, man?

20:52.215 --> 20:54.333
- You were better today.
- No, I wasn't.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.468
- You were.
- I'm just a body.

20:56.503 --> 20:58.504
- But what a body.
- Pay up.

20:58.555 --> 20:59.888
She still has to make it
through two more days.

20:59.923 --> 21:01.673
What are you talking about?

21:01.725 --> 21:03.225
They took bets on whether
or not he'd make you cry.

21:03.259 --> 21:06.895
That, and whether or not
he'd fire you.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.515
- You bet against me?
- Well, don't do that.

21:09.566 --> 21:11.350
- Guys.
- Ivy!

21:11.401 --> 21:13.102
Sam called and said you guys
were going out for drinks,

21:13.136 --> 21:14.837
- so I thought I might join you.
- Good.

21:14.871 --> 21:16.655
I'm glad you came out.

21:16.689 --> 21:18.524
Who are you and what have you
done with my friend Ivy?

21:18.575 --> 21:21.577
Shut up, I know
exactly what I'm doing.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.896
So I hear you get
to be Marilyn for a week.

21:23.930 --> 21:26.582
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

21:26.616 --> 21:30.169
- I brought you a present.
- You did?

21:30.203 --> 21:32.788
Just like the ones
Marilyn wore in <i>Niagara.</i>

21:32.822 --> 21:35.591
Now all you need
is a low-cut dress

21:35.625 --> 21:38.177
cinched at the waist,
and you'll be all set.

21:38.211 --> 21:39.595
La la.

21:39.629 --> 21:42.014
- Girl, hey.
- So good!

21:42.048 --> 21:44.533
Okay,
we all got through that.

21:44.567 --> 21:45.968
Now who's gonna
buy me a drink?

21:46.002 --> 21:47.719
- I will get us all a drink.
- Yes, please.

21:47.771 --> 21:51.106
Billy, can we have
five appletinis please?

21:54.010 --> 21:56.061
I can't believe we'll never
hear his laugh again.

21:56.112 --> 21:59.782
I guess it's true what
they say about three on a match.

21:59.816 --> 22:03.452
But while the flame burned,
it made a beautiful light.

22:05.738 --> 22:11.460
<i>So let us
raise a glass to him</i>

22:11.494 --> 22:13.712
<i>And let us give
three cheers</i>

22:13.746 --> 22:18.050
<i>And down the hatch</i>

22:18.084 --> 22:22.921
<i>friendship,
it will never dim</i>

22:22.972 --> 22:24.306
<i>For somewhere</i>

22:24.340 --> 22:28.627
<i>there will
always be</i>

22:28.661 --> 22:33.849
<i>Three on a</i>

22:33.883 --> 22:37.936
<i>match</i>

22:37.987 --> 22:41.256
This is the biggest piece
of junk we've ever written.

22:41.291 --> 22:42.774
Well, we were young.

22:42.826 --> 22:44.076
I think it's sweet.

22:47.063 --> 22:50.949
Look, they're standing!

22:51.000 --> 22:54.953
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you, thank you.

22:55.004 --> 23:00.959
We have two very, very special
guests with us here tonight...

23:01.010 --> 23:02.711
Tom Houston
and Julia Levitt!

23:04.547 --> 23:07.716
I mean, I mean...
God, I'm so excited.

23:07.750 --> 23:11.019
It's <i>Julia</i> Houston
and <i>Tom</i> Levitt.

23:16.425 --> 23:17.693
Stay here.

23:17.727 --> 23:21.063
No, Tom,
what are you doing?

23:21.097 --> 23:26.151
It's been ten years
since <i>Three on a match</i> opened.

23:26.202 --> 23:30.289
A lot's changed since,

23:30.323 --> 23:33.292
but one thing hasn't...
My enduring friendship

23:33.326 --> 23:36.828
with my writing partner,
Julia Houston.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.631
We always give each other
gifts on our anniversary,

23:39.666 --> 23:41.466
just like
a real husband and wife,

23:41.501 --> 23:43.552
and so this is

23:43.586 --> 23:47.639
my gift to you, honey.

23:49.676 --> 23:54.263
Signed by the cast and crew
of the 112th...

24:02.305 --> 24:04.106
She's got a thing about aprons,
what can I tell ya?

24:05.141 --> 24:06.658
Who's playing Marilyn?

24:06.693 --> 24:08.076
Rebecca Duvall.

24:08.111 --> 24:09.695
Is she related
to Robert Duvall?

24:09.746 --> 24:11.697
- 'Cause I love that guy.
- I don't know, maybe.

24:11.731 --> 24:13.515
You know, they tried
to concoct a musical

24:13.550 --> 24:14.750
out of my songs once.

24:14.784 --> 24:16.168
No, I didn't know that.

24:16.202 --> 24:17.502
Yeah, because
it was a piece of crap,

24:17.537 --> 24:18.670
never got off the ground.

24:18.705 --> 24:20.756
Those people,
they are insane.

24:20.790 --> 24:24.693
Well, many people
in the theater are insane.

24:24.727 --> 24:26.762
I, however,
am not one of them.

24:26.796 --> 24:30.215
But I'm not
going to lie to you.

24:30.266 --> 24:32.384
Investing in a musical
can be risky,

24:32.435 --> 24:34.803
but when a show hits,

24:34.837 --> 24:38.607
there's literally
no limit to the return.

24:38.641 --> 24:40.709
I already got so much money,
it's sick.

24:40.743 --> 24:42.294
Nick knows.

24:42.328 --> 24:44.029
He got me
into this one situation.

24:44.063 --> 24:46.381
- It was completely illegal.
- All right.

24:46.416 --> 24:48.150
But the money
kept pouring in.

24:48.184 --> 24:50.235
Randy.

24:50.286 --> 24:54.823
I just mean...
I don't need the money.

24:56.626 --> 24:58.543
Look, if I can't be there,
it really should be you.

24:58.578 --> 24:59.962
I'm not
really doing anything.

24:59.996 --> 25:01.747
He just moves me
around the stage.

25:01.798 --> 25:03.548
They did the same thing
to Marilyn.

25:03.583 --> 25:05.083
They just expected her
to be there,

25:05.134 --> 25:06.501
look gorgeous,
and do whatever she was told.

25:06.535 --> 25:07.919
She hated it.

25:07.971 --> 25:09.304
Yeah, but I'm just
an understudy.

25:09.339 --> 25:11.673
I can't actually
talk back to him.

25:11.707 --> 25:15.811
Karen, you get to be her
for one week.

25:15.845 --> 25:20.265
Don't waste the chance.

25:20.316 --> 25:22.768
There are other jobs
out there.

25:22.802 --> 25:24.102
Yesterday, I heard
there was a press opening

25:24.153 --> 25:25.237
at the white house.

25:25.271 --> 25:26.772
I could get you
an interview.

25:26.823 --> 25:28.307
You're kidding.

25:28.341 --> 25:30.292
- I'm not.
- D.C.

25:30.326 --> 25:32.244
It's a good town
for people like us.

25:32.278 --> 25:35.180
- What are "people like us"?
- Workaholic political junkies.

25:35.214 --> 25:38.450
I'm serious, I could get you
seen for that White House gig.

25:38.501 --> 25:41.286
Broadway equals New York.

25:41.337 --> 25:43.088
Dev, if she knows what
you've been going through...

25:43.122 --> 25:48.477
- She doesn't.
- You still haven't told her?

25:48.511 --> 25:49.711
It was beautiful.

25:49.745 --> 25:52.047
Well, we rehearsed
for four months.

25:52.081 --> 25:54.132
I know, we're not
up to your standards.

25:54.183 --> 25:55.717
We loved every minute.

25:55.751 --> 26:00.389
Well,
you're very sweet.

26:08.597 --> 26:09.865
What is the matter
with you?

26:09.899 --> 26:11.683
These people are nice,
really nice,

26:11.718 --> 26:14.236
and you hurt their feelings.
I didn't mean to.

26:14.270 --> 26:16.872
It was just really moving,
and I was overwhelmed,

26:16.906 --> 26:19.074
and I needed
a moment to be alone.

26:19.108 --> 26:21.243
You weren't just rude
to these nice people,

26:21.277 --> 26:22.911
you were rude to me.

26:22.945 --> 26:24.796
If you don't want to do
these anniversaries any more,

26:24.831 --> 26:26.248
just say so.
Don't act like you're above...

26:26.282 --> 26:28.717
- I'm not.
- This or me or us.

26:28.751 --> 26:30.135
- I don't.
- Just say it.

26:30.169 --> 26:32.671
Say what is bothering you.

26:32.722 --> 26:34.526
Frank found out.

26:38.895 --> 26:40.562
And he left me.

26:40.596 --> 26:43.648
Frank found out
and he left me.

26:43.683 --> 26:44.850
Left you?
Come on.

26:44.901 --> 26:46.902
- Left you?
- He's gone.

26:46.936 --> 26:47.903
I've left him
a hundred messages.

26:47.937 --> 26:48.987
He won't pick up.

26:49.021 --> 26:50.672
He won't call me back.

26:56.079 --> 27:01.867
He talks to Leo.

27:01.918 --> 27:05.604
- How is Leo?
- He's managing somehow.

27:05.638 --> 27:09.207
He's so nice to me,
and I ruined everything.

27:12.962 --> 27:15.881
He sees Frank.
I... he told me he sees him.

27:15.932 --> 27:19.551
But Frank won't talk to me.

27:22.271 --> 27:24.606
I am sorry.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.476
I am so sorry
I wrecked our anniversary.

27:27.510 --> 27:28.777
Stop.

27:28.811 --> 27:31.563
Stop, stop, stop.

27:36.152 --> 27:39.788
Why didn't you tell me?

27:44.577 --> 27:49.080
Because I thought that,
if I never told you,

27:49.132 --> 27:55.003
maybe it wasn't real.

27:55.037 --> 27:57.037
Now it's real.

28:05.664 --> 28:07.664
You'll gonna be home for dinner
tonight?

28:07.748 --> 28:09.115
I have wrestling,
remember?

28:09.149 --> 28:11.418
Right.

28:11.452 --> 28:14.120
Maybe I'll come.

28:14.154 --> 28:17.457
If you want.

28:17.491 --> 28:21.544
Is,
Is your father gonna be there?

28:21.596 --> 28:24.130
If he were,
I wouldn't say you could come.

28:24.164 --> 28:27.550
Look, I do tell him
to call you.

28:27.602 --> 28:31.605
I think this sucks.
I'm not the problem here.

28:36.227 --> 28:38.478
It's cold outside.

28:38.512 --> 28:39.729
You're going to need more
than this.

28:39.764 --> 28:40.730
- Mom.
- Just go do it.

29:01.135 --> 29:03.336
So, Ivy baby,
you've got to tell me

29:03.370 --> 29:04.988
what the hell
you've been up to.

29:05.022 --> 29:06.573
- What on earth do you mean?
- No.

29:06.607 --> 29:08.742
No, I've known you too long
for that one.

29:08.776 --> 29:11.094
Come on, Sam.

29:11.145 --> 29:14.764
I love <i>Marilyn,</i>
and I worked so hard on it.

29:14.815 --> 29:17.067
And I'm a really nice person

29:17.101 --> 29:19.686
who just had a little bit
of a hard time.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.404
Don't I deserve
a second chance?

29:21.439 --> 29:25.842
Playing nice
to get back into the show.

29:25.876 --> 29:28.697
Clever.

29:32.733 --> 29:36.703
That train wreck
of a show we saw... pilloried.

29:36.737 --> 29:39.205
Why be a critic
if you despise the theater?

29:39.239 --> 29:44.010
You hated that play.
We left at intermission.

29:44.045 --> 29:46.680
Look at that,
the Knicks lost another game,

29:46.714 --> 29:50.216
but the writer doesn't trash
the whole team.

29:50.251 --> 29:51.634
You're reading
the sports section?

29:51.686 --> 29:54.137
Sure, why not?

29:54.188 --> 29:55.638
Because, as far as I know,

29:55.673 --> 29:58.058
you have no interest
in sports whatsoever.

29:58.092 --> 30:01.695
I like to look
at tall men in mesh shorts.

30:01.729 --> 30:03.780
Do you think I'm blind?

30:03.814 --> 30:05.414
What?

30:09.236 --> 30:12.122
I accept that we go
to the theater all the time.

30:12.156 --> 30:14.791
I accept that you don't
like my politics.

30:14.825 --> 30:16.659
But having feelings
for someone else?

30:16.711 --> 30:18.828
That I cannot accept.

30:18.863 --> 30:20.163
What are you talking about?

30:20.214 --> 30:23.249
You're crazy
about that dancer.

30:23.283 --> 30:25.168
- Tom.
- What are...

30:25.202 --> 30:27.654
Don't.
I mean it.

30:27.688 --> 30:29.589
Look, Sam...
I barely know him.

30:29.623 --> 30:31.307
He's a friend of Ivy's.

30:31.342 --> 30:33.143
And you light up like a candle
whenever you look at him,

30:33.177 --> 30:35.145
and you never look
at me like that.

30:35.179 --> 30:36.516
You just don't.

30:39.567 --> 30:42.571
It's okay, Tom.
Really.

30:45.106 --> 30:46.610
Goodbye.

30:53.748 --> 30:55.115
It's me.
Don't hang up.

30:55.149 --> 30:57.002
I know you're there.

30:59.437 --> 31:02.088
I stole Leo's cell,

31:02.123 --> 31:05.425
because you won't
pick up my calls.

31:05.459 --> 31:08.762
But you have to.

31:08.796 --> 31:10.713
Frank, I know
that you're hurt.

31:10.765 --> 31:12.766
I know that...

31:12.800 --> 31:17.720
You don't feel ready
to talk, but...

31:17.772 --> 31:19.908
I can't take this any more.

31:21.942 --> 31:23.393
You have to, Frank,
you have to talk to me.

31:23.444 --> 31:26.131
I'm gonna die
if you don't talk to me.

31:32.820 --> 31:34.287
What is it, Ellis?

31:34.321 --> 31:37.207
I did some research
on that Cobra guy.

31:37.241 --> 31:39.609
Don't tell me,
he gave away all his money.

31:39.643 --> 31:41.478
No, he's still loaded,

31:41.512 --> 31:44.464
and not shy
about investing in projects.

31:44.498 --> 31:45.915
Perfect.

31:45.966 --> 31:47.267
Then I looked
into that bartender, Nick,

31:47.301 --> 31:49.552
and that's where things
got interesting.

31:49.587 --> 31:52.105
- Stop.
- I think you want to hear this.

31:52.139 --> 31:55.058
I think you thought wrong.
How dare you go delving

31:55.092 --> 31:57.143
into the personal lives
of my friends?

31:57.178 --> 31:59.095
Well, he's an investor too,
though, isn't he?

31:59.129 --> 32:01.097
I mean, he's the guy
that brought in all the money.

32:01.131 --> 32:02.816
That means he's a partner.

32:02.850 --> 32:05.986
Go get me a coffee
and take this with you.

32:13.944 --> 32:15.328
Men in dresses,

32:15.362 --> 32:17.580
who's gonna pay to see that?

32:17.615 --> 32:19.999
Cross-dressing in the theater
has a long history,

32:20.034 --> 32:22.035
all the way
back to the greeks.

32:22.069 --> 32:24.454
The stage wasn't considered
a proper place for a woman.

32:24.505 --> 32:25.872
The home was
their proper sphere.

32:25.906 --> 32:27.590
Karen, move.

32:27.625 --> 32:29.943
Sorry, sorry.

32:29.977 --> 32:31.845
I just... can't believe
he says that.

32:31.879 --> 32:34.049
It's so dumb.

32:36.083 --> 32:38.301
- What?
- The thing about the Greeks.

32:38.352 --> 32:39.969
Like what I need right now
is a stupid lecture.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.471
Just do it.

32:41.522 --> 32:42.772
I'm trying
to think like Marilyn,

32:42.806 --> 32:44.307
and you're not
exactly helping.

32:44.358 --> 32:47.161
Could you at least
<i>try</i> and listen?

32:53.183 --> 32:55.685
And yet,
I need you downstage.

32:55.719 --> 32:56.703
I don't care where you need me.

32:56.737 --> 32:58.154
Your blocking stinks.

32:58.205 --> 32:59.956
And you know what else?
I don't appreciate

32:59.990 --> 33:02.325
that crack about the home being
a proper place for a woman.

33:02.376 --> 33:03.877
It sounds like something
Joe would say.

33:03.911 --> 33:06.546
Besides, I want
to stay home, I...

33:06.580 --> 33:07.881
I want a life
with this guy.

33:07.915 --> 33:09.499
I'm trying to have
a baby with him,

33:09.550 --> 33:13.169
and all he wants to do
is put Marilyn back to work.

33:15.923 --> 33:17.657
Derek...

33:17.691 --> 33:20.495
Derek, hello?
You all right?

33:22.529 --> 33:24.731
Yeah, fine.

33:24.765 --> 33:26.733
I'll put you nose to nose,

33:26.767 --> 33:28.067
see how that works.

33:28.102 --> 33:29.652
You want me
to write that down?

33:29.687 --> 33:30.687
No,
Linda's got the blocking.

33:32.139 --> 33:36.142
Let's just forge ahead.

33:37.945 --> 33:41.197
- Well, what time is it,
3:30?

33:41.248 --> 33:42.498
He's probably still in bed.

33:42.533 --> 33:46.169
Don't worry,
he'll call you.

33:46.203 --> 33:49.522
You know, Nick,
I really appreciate this,

33:49.556 --> 33:51.708
but... I don't want
to presume anything.

33:51.742 --> 33:54.210
"Presume"?

33:54.261 --> 33:57.180
Well, if this all
goes ahead,

33:57.214 --> 33:59.549
you'll have brought in
a major investor.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.436
And... people get paid a lot
of money for that kind of thing.

34:03.470 --> 34:04.771
I didn't bring him in.
You brought him in.

34:04.805 --> 34:06.356
You introduced us.

34:06.390 --> 34:08.942
I introduced you
because I wanted to help you.

34:08.976 --> 34:11.945
Well, I'll be honest...
You should ask for something.

34:11.978 --> 34:14.614
Don't worry,
I will.

34:16.150 --> 34:19.652
Is that him?

34:19.686 --> 34:20.719
No.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.705
<i>Hola?</i>

34:22.739 --> 34:26.692
<i>Si, espero</i>
<i>que todos es bueno.</i>

34:38.505 --> 34:41.556
You forget your key?

34:43.210 --> 34:44.761
Sorry.

34:44.812 --> 34:49.098
Marilyn's coming home
with you, I see.

34:49.149 --> 34:52.601
I guess so.
What can I do for you?

34:52.652 --> 34:55.788
I just had
a call from Eileen.

34:55.822 --> 34:57.774
Rebecca's gonna be turning up
sooner than we thought.

34:57.825 --> 35:00.593
She'll be
at rehearsals tomorrow.

35:03.814 --> 35:06.799
You did some great work,
Karen.

35:06.834 --> 35:08.101
The show is
better off for it.

35:08.135 --> 35:11.371
You came over here
to tell me that?

35:11.405 --> 35:14.157
Yes, I did.

35:14.191 --> 35:15.842
I,

35:15.876 --> 35:20.980
I also...
wanted to apologize.

35:21.015 --> 35:24.117
For what?

35:24.151 --> 35:25.635
I think you know.

35:25.669 --> 35:28.039
That night in my apartment?

35:30.074 --> 35:32.225
Look, I'll admit,
I made certain assumptions

35:32.259 --> 35:37.113
based on a hard-wired set
of personal experiences,

35:37.147 --> 35:39.532
which, to be fair,

35:39.566 --> 35:44.037
befall many
a director of note.

35:44.071 --> 35:47.573
But that doesn't make them
warranted or justified.

35:47.607 --> 35:49.876
That's the apology?

35:49.910 --> 35:52.330
Don't expect miracles.

35:54.381 --> 35:56.049
But come expecting
to work tomorrow.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.468
You're not going to be benched until
she turns up in the afternoon.

35:58.502 --> 36:01.504
We'll be looking
at act two.

36:03.123 --> 36:06.125
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:19.189 --> 36:22.742
What are you
doing here?

36:22.776 --> 36:24.160
I said,
what are you doing here?

36:24.194 --> 36:26.079
What are you,
her watch dog?

36:26.113 --> 36:27.914
No,
I'm her boyfriend.

36:27.948 --> 36:29.582
Yeah, well, I'm her director,
so keep your hands to yourself.

36:29.616 --> 36:31.167
Well, according to Karen,

36:31.201 --> 36:32.285
I think you're the one
who needs to do that.

36:32.319 --> 36:33.870
Sod off.

36:35.756 --> 36:37.290
Come on, then.

36:46.666 --> 36:48.217
Dev, no.

36:48.268 --> 36:50.103
Dev, stop!
Stop.

36:50.137 --> 36:52.355
Get off.

36:52.389 --> 36:55.224
Get off.

36:55.275 --> 36:59.178
Derek, just go.

37:05.071 --> 37:06.191
Easy!

37:07.465 --> 37:09.651
He's lucky I held back.

37:09.669 --> 37:13.171
- Who?
- Dev.

37:13.206 --> 37:14.806
Karen's boyfriend?

37:14.841 --> 37:18.293
He's a bloody lunatic.

37:18.344 --> 37:21.930
- I don't understand.
- Look...

37:21.965 --> 37:23.649
I went 'round there
to tell Karen

37:23.683 --> 37:25.150
that she's going back
into the ensemble tomorrow,

37:25.184 --> 37:26.685
and he went ballistic.

37:26.719 --> 37:28.837
Why didn't you
just call her?

37:28.871 --> 37:30.689
I was trying to be nice.

37:30.723 --> 37:31.807
You couldn't be nice
to her on the phone?

37:31.858 --> 37:33.525
God,
not you too.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.894
It's not like I have to shag
every leading lady.

37:35.928 --> 37:40.566
- Understudy.
- Whatever.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.317
He's my boss.

37:42.368 --> 37:44.119
Why did you have to hit him?
He was here for ten seconds.

37:44.153 --> 37:45.654
What was he
doing here anyway?

37:45.705 --> 37:47.573
I told you,
he knew I'd be disappointed.

37:47.607 --> 37:48.624
So he had to see you
in your underwear?

37:48.658 --> 37:50.075
No.

37:50.109 --> 37:51.627
I don't want you
anywhere near that sod.

37:51.661 --> 37:53.145
What am I supposed
to do, quit?

37:53.179 --> 37:56.415
- Would you?
- Is that for real?

37:57.995 --> 37:59.799
What if it was?

38:01.374 --> 38:04.042
What if there was an
opportunity for me

38:04.043 --> 38:05.443
outside of New York?

38:05.518 --> 38:06.935
Is there?

38:06.969 --> 38:08.520
Why can't you
just answer the question?

38:08.666 --> 38:10.250
Because, Dev,
<i>Marilyn</i> is everything

38:10.284 --> 38:12.085
I came to this city to do,
everything I want to be.

38:12.136 --> 38:14.137
What if I asked you to give up
everything that you wanted?

38:14.171 --> 38:17.390
What, for you?

38:17.424 --> 38:18.743
Go ahead.

38:20.778 --> 38:22.148
Ask me.

38:34.692 --> 38:38.161
The Cuban assistant crisis
has been averted.

38:38.195 --> 38:41.581
Rebecca will be at rehearsal
tomorrow afternoon.

38:41.615 --> 38:43.082
I'll be there.

38:43.117 --> 38:45.869
I still want to meet with her
privately, and see the designs.

38:45.903 --> 38:49.422
Robin, I just don't think
that's gonna happen.

38:49.456 --> 38:51.457
Now wait a minute...

38:51.508 --> 38:55.445
I'd like to introduce you
to <i>Bombshell's</i> latest investor,

38:55.479 --> 38:59.382
Mr. Randy Cobra.

38:59.416 --> 39:01.351
What's up?

39:01.385 --> 39:02.685
Ellis, I think
you have something

39:02.720 --> 39:04.354
to give to these people.

39:04.388 --> 39:05.889
Your contracts.

39:05.923 --> 39:07.223
Well, what are we
supposed to do with these?

39:07.257 --> 39:09.692
Nothing.
Give it here.

39:09.727 --> 39:12.612
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'm not following this.

39:12.646 --> 39:15.481
What the lady is saying
is that my man is in...

39:15.532 --> 39:16.904
And you're out.

39:24.608 --> 39:27.994
Rock and roll!

39:38.756 --> 39:44.010
<i>As a girl I lived
in a million homes</i>

39:44.061 --> 39:48.815
<i>So I always would
keep to myself</i>

39:48.849 --> 39:52.819
<i>And my lessons were learned
from the stories and poems</i>

39:52.853 --> 39:56.739
<i>I would steal
from a library shelf</i>

39:56.774 --> 39:59.909
<i>Yes, the books,
like the rooms</i>

39:59.944 --> 40:02.662
<i>Weren't mine to keep</i>

40:02.696 --> 40:08.418
<i>but the words
weren't left behind</i>

40:08.452 --> 40:14.424
<i>And I think of them all now
when I can't sleep</i>

40:14.458 --> 40:20.463
<i>And a poet
who read my mind</i>

40:23.667 --> 40:26.803
<i>As the wise man
once wrote</i>

40:26.837 --> 40:30.840
<i>"Never give
all the heart"</i>

40:33.143 --> 40:35.979
<i>Well, it's easy to see</i>

40:36.013 --> 40:38.448
<i>he was writing for me</i>

40:38.482 --> 40:43.987
<i>I just wish
I could play that part</i>

40:44.021 --> 40:49.125
<i>Yes, he scribbled that love
isn't worth thinking of</i>

40:49.159 --> 40:53.546
<i>That it fades out
from kiss to kiss</i>

40:53.580 --> 40:56.799
<i>If I'd just
learned those lines</i>

40:56.834 --> 41:02.055
<i>Well, just think
of the misery I'd miss</i>

41:04.141 --> 41:07.477
<i>As the irishman said</i>

41:07.511 --> 41:12.015
<i>"don't put your heart
up to play"</i>

41:13.984 --> 41:16.652
<i>When he warned
of the cost</i>

41:16.687 --> 41:18.104
<i>And the heart
that he lost</i>

41:18.155 --> 41:22.608
<i>Mr. Yeats really
paved the way</i>

41:22.659 --> 41:25.578
<i>For the men
that I've known</i>

41:25.612 --> 41:28.664
<i>Who have clearly shown</i>

41:28.699 --> 41:32.502
<i>they've been reading him
from the start</i>

41:32.536 --> 41:36.122
<i>'Cause when it comes to me</i>

41:36.173 --> 41:40.543
<i>well, the kisses come free</i>

41:40.577 --> 41:44.797
<i>but they never give all</i>

42:17.081 --> 42:19.332
Hello.

42:19.383 --> 42:22.468
Am I in the right place?

42:22.503 --> 42:28.174
Rebecca Duvall!

42:28.208 --> 42:29.796
You look wonderful.
