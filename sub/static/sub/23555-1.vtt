01:16.542 --> 01:18.292
The years before 1974

01:18.417 --> 01:20.708
marked the darkest period

01:21.417 --> 01:25.208
in Hong Kong's history.

01:35.750 --> 01:39.042
My name is Crippled Ho. I'm from Chaozhou.

01:39.083 --> 01:41.958
This was the moment I arrived in Hong Kong.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.375
After starving for four days,
my buddies and I finally got our first meal.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.000
But I wasn't discouraged.

01:47.042 --> 01:49.458
I always remembered what my dad told me:

01:49.500 --> 01:53.000
Life or death, poverty or riches,
It's all destined.

02:59.417 --> 03:00.542
"1960"

03:00.583 --> 03:01.792
The food is ready!

03:01.833 --> 03:04.500
You pricks. I'm home.

03:04.542 --> 03:05.083
Congee.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.000
Are we having congee again?

03:06.042 --> 03:08.625
- Yeah, congee... congee...
- Dee, have some congee.

03:09.667 --> 03:10.792
Landlady, Landlady!

03:10.833 --> 03:13.292
I'm sorry. I'll have the money tonight...

03:13.333 --> 03:14.875
- Definitely tonight!
- Now you promised me!

03:14.917 --> 03:17.958
- Remember that. Don't you lie to me, you chump!
- Brother Ho.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.375
How's the congee?

03:19.875 --> 03:21.083
Quite outstanding!

03:21.125 --> 03:23.583
Quite outstanding. You liar.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.375
How outstanding can you be?

03:25.958 --> 03:27.375
Quite fantastic!

03:28.958 --> 03:30.125
Alva,

03:30.167 --> 03:33.542
have some congee. It's hot, be careful.

03:35.375 --> 03:36.292
Dig in.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yum, congee!

03:42.917 --> 03:44.708
There's no job at the construction site tonight.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.125
Are you guys going fighting again tonight?

03:48.167 --> 03:51.333
I make $2 at the construction site,
and $30 for fighting.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.125
Most of the time we're bluffing
and not fighting anyway.

03:53.167 --> 03:55.875
We get there, shout a little,
curse a little, then boom! We get paid!

03:55.917 --> 03:58.458
If I had a choice,
do you think I'd prefer this kind of lifestyle?

03:58.958 --> 04:00.458
Oh, I almost forgot...

04:06.375 --> 04:07.667
this is your tuition money.

04:14.542 --> 04:16.541
Brother Rock, you're so late!

04:16.583 --> 04:17.500
I've been busy!

04:17.541 --> 04:20.166
Oh, you know Ngan is very petty
about things like that.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.583
But look what I got him--
he shouldn't be petty about this!

04:22.625 --> 04:25.333
Wow, that looks expensive!
I'm sure he'll be very pleased.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.375
Let's go.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.375
Lee Rock, upstairs please.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.875
I thought this was only his birthday party.

04:31.917 --> 04:33.250
It sure looks like the Queen's birthday to me.

04:33.292 --> 04:34.042
It certainly does, huh!

04:34.083 --> 04:34.958
Mrs. Ngan!

04:35.000 --> 04:35.625
Mrs. Ngan!

04:35.667 --> 04:36.958
Lee Rock is here
to wish Sir Ngan a happy birthday.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.792
Lee Rock,

04:38.292 --> 04:39.875
you must be very busy now,
having been promoted to Sergeant Major.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.042
Just a little busy.

04:41.958 --> 04:43.250
This is for Sir Ngan.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.042
Okay then, put it over there.
Make yourselves at home.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.042
That's okay.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.208
So that's why she didn't even lift an eyebrow...

04:52.250 --> 04:54.417
There's so much gold here he could open a shop.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.542
This still costs money, you know.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.917
Well then, just put it on the pile with the others.

04:58.958 --> 04:59.958
Of course.

05:00.958 --> 05:03.125
I'll just put it somewhere obvious... like this.

05:06.333 --> 05:07.333
Fuck off!

05:08.125 --> 05:09.500
Hey, sit down!

05:10.125 --> 05:12.792
Hunter just wants to play a game
with you guys, alright?

05:14.625 --> 05:15.625
That's for you.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.375
Superintendent Hunter,
that rotten jerk is trashed again.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.667
Let's play cards.

05:20.625 --> 05:24.667
He's so funny.
He's always like that when he's drunk.

05:25.042 --> 05:27.250
Bust! Bust! Bust!

05:27.292 --> 05:28.208
Damn it!

05:28.250 --> 05:29.792
Wooo, we're so lucky!

05:30.208 --> 05:31.250
Shut up!

05:31.292 --> 05:34.292
Show us the money! Come on!

05:34.333 --> 05:35.750
It's only a few hundred bucks.

05:35.792 --> 05:38.708
There you go... one for you, and one for you.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.250
I think what he means by that

05:40.292 --> 05:43.208
is if you want a promotion,
just go ahead and take the cash!

05:47.208 --> 05:49.000
Who's the gweilo now?

05:51.542 --> 05:52.458
What are you doing!

05:52.500 --> 05:54.375
So the British are immune
to paying what they owe?!

05:58.667 --> 06:00.000
Brother Rock!

06:00.417 --> 06:01.125
Rock, bro, don't do this!

06:01.167 --> 06:02.292
What do you think you're doing?

06:02.333 --> 06:03.083
Stop it!

06:05.125 --> 06:07.167
Bro Rock, stop it! You can't win this.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.167
Help the Superintendent clean up.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.250
Our new Sergeant Major is arrogant!

06:17.292 --> 06:18.667
So cocky! How dare you beat up the Superintendent?

06:19.292 --> 06:20.125
That's not true. I didn't...

06:20.167 --> 06:22.083
You're acting like a boss,
being in charge of Shau Kei Wan.

06:22.708 --> 06:23.917
I can't wait to see you take over Wan Chai.

06:23.958 --> 06:24.917
Maybe then I'll get a good beating, too.

06:24.958 --> 06:27.333
No, Sir Ngan! We are sorry.
Lee Rock is just drunk.

06:27.375 --> 06:31.167
Then get the hell out of here!
What are you waiting for?!

06:32.333 --> 06:33.208
We should go...

06:33.250 --> 06:34.208
We're leaving now, happy birthday!

06:35.542 --> 06:36.917
Let's go dancing.

06:36.958 --> 06:40.208
Let go of me. I'm fine!

06:40.792 --> 06:43.708
If it weren't for you,
I would've pulled out my gun and shot him!

06:44.875 --> 06:46.417
We'll wait for the right time to get revenge.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.125
Compose yourself or you'll screw it up.

06:48.167 --> 06:50.333
It's like constipation.
You just have to tolerate it for a while.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.333
Even if I tolerate him,
it's hard to tolerate his wife!

06:52.375 --> 06:53.292
That's true, too.

06:53.333 --> 06:56.083
I knew you wanted to get 
your gun out and shoot her too!

06:56.542 --> 06:57.833
We have to lie low and wait for our chance.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.333
- Brother Rock!
- What is it?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.708
Comic and Grizzly Bear
are having a big fight tonight.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.375
Comic is coming all the way
from Kowloon City with his gang?

07:04.417 --> 07:06.167
There are more than a hundred men on each side.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.458
Why do you still help him
when he treats you like shit?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.542
You don't have to be so generous.

07:20.583 --> 07:23.167
Messing with Ngan means messing
with the whole police force.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.375
It's saving face that matters.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.417
Right?

07:25.583 --> 07:27.750
Here's a news break for you, Hunt.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.708
Some Chinese are making trouble downstairs.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.083
Go and sort it out for me, old boy.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.333
That's music to my ears.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.708
You don't need to ask me twice.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.583
Christmas has come early.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.583
Hey bro, aren't you worried about making

08:14.625 --> 08:16.875
a big scene at Sir Ngan's birthday?

08:18.500 --> 08:19.833
That's exactly what I wanna do.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.500
I'll show him that Grizzly Bear is mad
and not a nice person!

08:28.792 --> 08:31.958
Doing business in all of Kowloon
isn't enough for you, you prick?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.832
Why do you have to rob me on my turf?

08:34.457 --> 08:35.375
Since Sir Ngan isn't doing anything about it

08:35.417 --> 08:36.500
I gotta take things into my own hands.

08:36.542 --> 08:37.167
We're standing on the wrong side!

08:37.207 --> 08:38.375
You stole my business in Kwun Tong

08:38.417 --> 08:41.707
and Tsz Wan Shan. Now you wanna play games?

08:41.750 --> 08:44.458
So let's play big.
Get yourself a nice coffin, Grizzly Bear!

08:44.500 --> 08:45.833
Shit, are they here to fight or not?!

08:46.083 --> 08:47.583
What's with the lecture!

08:47.625 --> 08:49.625
We're gangsters! The nastiest one

08:49.667 --> 08:51.250
always gets the biggest share... that's life!

08:51.500 --> 08:54.333
Brother Ho,
I thought we were just here to fake fight.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.833
This time we're screwed.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.792
From now on, I make the rules!

08:57.833 --> 08:58.500
Yeah!

08:58.542 --> 08:59.333
Let's get ourselves some weapons.

08:59.375 --> 09:04.125
You ain't making nothing!
Not even your own coffin!

09:04.167 --> 09:06.875
I'm gonna chop you up and feed you to the dogs!

09:07.708 --> 09:08.833
Who threw that at me?

09:08.875 --> 09:10.625
Why couldn't you wait until I was done
before you dropped that?

09:10.667 --> 09:11.708
Fuck them up!

09:11.792 --> 09:13.208
- Let's go!
- Come on!

09:13.250 --> 09:14.375
I'll kill you!

09:17.333 --> 09:20.917
Hey Chubby, your two buddies
are killing each other down there.

09:20.958 --> 09:22.250
Aren't you going to offer your help?

09:22.292 --> 09:24.833
Are you kidding me, Sir Ngan?

09:24.875 --> 09:27.667
You know how I dread the sight of blood.

09:48.042 --> 09:50.625
Oh, it's so bloodthirsty!
I'd rather get back to the card table.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.167
Fuck them up!

10:07.250 --> 10:08.583
Hack him!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.417
Hit him!

10:13.542 --> 10:14.958
We're screwed!

10:21.917 --> 10:22.750
Fuck you!

10:24.833 --> 10:26.958
The boy with curly hair is quite a fighter!

11:04.792 --> 11:06.542
Big Bro, we're being cornered!

11:06.792 --> 11:08.875
Why don't you go now? I'll take care of the cops!

11:08.917 --> 11:09.750
Good, brother!

11:09.792 --> 11:10.708
Run!

11:13.333 --> 11:14.750
Who called the riot police?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.667
Fire!

11:26.833 --> 11:28.375
Take them down!

11:39.708 --> 11:42.542
Hey, don't you dare come near me!

11:42.583 --> 11:44.375
- Which side are you on?
- I'm asking you which side!

11:44.417 --> 11:45.167
I'm asking you which side!

11:45.208 --> 11:45.958
- Which side are you on?
- I was asking you!

11:46.000 --> 11:49.333
I asked you first. Say it. Where?

11:49.458 --> 11:50.083
Say it! Say it!

11:50.125 --> 11:51.208
Oh, so you are on Grizzly Bear's side.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.167
I'm Grizzly's right hand man, Will.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.583
You son of a bitch!

11:56.625 --> 11:57.500
You almost got us killed.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.792
You said we'd get an easy 30 bucks.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.333
Look at the mess now! What do we do?

12:00.375 --> 12:02.500
I don't know which moron threw down the bottle!

12:04.375 --> 12:05.833
Hey... hey, we're on the same team, the same team!

12:06.833 --> 12:10.042
Cover your mouth, cover your mouth!

12:16.375 --> 12:18.375
Get down... hey!

12:18.875 --> 12:19.875
Well done.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.333
Hey!

13:01.375 --> 13:02.583
Hey, stop!

13:02.750 --> 13:04.000
Stop them!

13:07.125 --> 13:10.375
Brother Rock, Hunter's gone crazy.
Should we check on him?

13:11.625 --> 13:12.750
Yeah, let's check on him.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.792
Stop!

13:16.375 --> 13:17.458
Stop!

13:17.917 --> 13:19.417
Freeze! Hands in the air!

13:26.917 --> 13:28.542
- Alright, you scumbags!
- Ok, ok, ok...

13:28.583 --> 13:30.375
Don't you fucking move!

13:30.417 --> 13:31.958
Break their fucking legs!

13:32.125 --> 13:33.875
- Aren't you done hitting us?
- Shut up!

13:37.958 --> 13:39.708
- Get 'em down!
- You son of a bitch!

13:54.125 --> 13:55.208
Stop it!

13:55.625 --> 13:56.667
Stop it!

13:56.917 --> 13:58.542
- But he...!
- I am telling you to stop!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.583
Freeze!

14:00.958 --> 14:02.333
Drop the baton!

14:03.500 --> 14:05.500
I'm telling you to drop the baton!

14:06.833 --> 14:08.250
Back off, and I'll make sure 
nothing happens to you.

14:13.167 --> 14:13.958
Are we going back to headquarters?

14:14.000 --> 14:14.875
Are you nuts?

14:15.250 --> 14:16.708
They won't stand a chance at HQ.

14:16.750 --> 14:17.542
Just take them to the Shau Kei Wan branch.

14:17.583 --> 14:18.792
What about my friends?

14:18.833 --> 14:19.917
You'll be together.

14:25.542 --> 14:28.083
Brother Rock, here's your coffee 
and pineapple bun.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.292
Thanks.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.333
Piggy-

14:36.833 --> 14:37.833
Look at this.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.500
Hong Kong is such a small place,

14:39.542 --> 14:41.708
but we can earn money easily.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.000
The triads out there are just robbing people.

14:47.042 --> 14:49.208
They don't make real money, and neither will we.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.542
I'd say, if I get to call the shots,

14:52.208 --> 14:53.833
there'd be rules for everyone to follow.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.833
Then, everyone would have enough to eat.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.375
We'd make a lot more! Do you believe me?

14:58.833 --> 15:00.417
Really? Is that so?

15:00.458 --> 15:01.542
Of course it's true!

15:03.042 --> 15:04.875
Let me do the math...

15:05.417 --> 15:10.125
10 in one month, 
and 10 times 10 months will become 100.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.333
One million?

15:11.375 --> 15:14.667
You mean 5 million? You're joking, Rock!

15:16.083 --> 15:17.167
Give me your hand.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.542
It's 100 times 5 million!

15:21.833 --> 15:23.083
500 million.

15:24.708 --> 15:26.375
You guys okay? Any problems?

15:26.417 --> 15:28.667
It's okay. A little beating won't hurt anyone.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.042
I'm fine.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.542
That's good.

15:33.750 --> 15:34.875
Brother Ho,

15:35.417 --> 15:37.375
we haven't gotten paid for the fight.

15:37.417 --> 15:38.417
We have to get paid.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.417
Once we get out of here,
we'll find Grizzly to get our money.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.875
Good!

15:41.917 --> 15:44.708
And don't tell my brother
about what happened today.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.083
You know how he is,

15:46.417 --> 15:48.917
he'll keep lecturing us.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.292
Understood.

15:54.000 --> 15:54.792
Hey, Piggy-

15:54.833 --> 15:56.833
Hey Jan! What took you so long?
Were you on the toilet?

15:56.875 --> 15:57.917
Brother Rock has been waiting for you.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.625
What is it?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.333
You see... there're a bunch
of Chaozhou guys in there,

16:00.375 --> 16:01.375
and you're from Chaozhou, too.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.708
You guys can break the ice.

16:04.083 --> 16:05.917
Aren't you from Chaozhou, Brother Rock?

16:05.958 --> 16:07.292
Yes, but last night,

16:07.333 --> 16:09.417
I pointed a gun at him.
I'm afraid he may have hard feelings about it.

16:09.458 --> 16:10.333
Will you take care of it for me?

16:10.375 --> 16:11.292
Ah, sure.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.333
Are these the guys?

16:20.042 --> 16:21.917
Hey buddy, are you from Chaozhou?

16:21.958 --> 16:23.333
Yes, yes. We are from Chaozhou.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.250
Cut us some slack, Brother!

16:25.708 --> 16:28.250
Do you understand or speak Cantonese?

16:28.292 --> 16:29.292
Yes, yes, yes.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.250
This is our Sergeant Major, Lee Rock.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.125
Brother Rock!

16:33.167 --> 16:35.250
Who do you work for? Grizzly Bear or Comic?

16:36.458 --> 16:37.625
We were only there to fight!

16:38.458 --> 16:40.750
Will said we'd get 30 bucks if we won

16:40.792 --> 16:42.458
or 20 if we lost.

16:44.625 --> 16:47.292
Will is Grizzly Bear's man.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.083
How long have you been in Hong Kong?

16:53.125 --> 16:55.458
I've been here for almost a year already.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.167
Thank you.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.375
You are one hell of a good fighter.

17:01.417 --> 17:03.375
No, no. I'm not.

17:04.583 --> 17:05.666
What's your name?

17:06.291 --> 17:10.291
I'm Ho. Ho, from Dahao City.

17:10.333 --> 17:10.958
Oh you're from Dahao City.

17:11.000 --> 17:11.666
Yes, I'm from Dahao City.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.000
That makes us Dahao brothers!

17:13.041 --> 17:15.000
That's great. We're Dahao brothers.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.708
Hey, we're all from Dahao.

17:16.750 --> 17:17.625
Hey, Dahao brother!

17:17.666 --> 17:18.875
Hey Bro!

17:18.916 --> 17:20.958
Hey, bro. What's your name?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.375
Oh, call me Jan.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.125
Brother Jan, Brother Jan!

17:23.166 --> 17:25.083
He's Ho, we're from the same city.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.500
Brother Rock, the press is here.

17:27.541 --> 17:28.500
Ok, noted.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.000
Since you're all from the same hometown,

17:30.042 --> 17:31.667
just quickly finish the papers and let them go.

17:31.708 --> 17:32.833
No.

17:33.167 --> 17:37.042
According to the rules,
we have to keep them for 8 hours.

17:38.875 --> 17:39.875
Alright.

17:40.958 --> 17:42.000
Brother Rock, thank you for taking care of us!

17:42.042 --> 17:44.083
Brother Jan, you don't always have
to play by the book, you know.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.000
Why aren't you moving?

17:47.042 --> 17:48.875
- I'm waiting for you.
- Oh, thanks for your concern.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.917
Get his phone number and address.

17:51.958 --> 17:52.542
Roger that.

17:52.583 --> 17:53.500
Brother Jan,

17:54.333 --> 17:56.250
since we are Dahao folks,
please take special care of us.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.667
Come and find me if you need anything.

17:57.708 --> 17:58.542
Sure. Sure.

17:58.583 --> 18:00.417
Also, let me tell you,

18:00.458 --> 18:01.667
in Hong Kong, temptation is everywhere.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.167
No matter what you do,

18:04.208 --> 18:06.500
never join the triads! Otherwise,
you will never get your life back.

18:06.542 --> 18:07.625
Understood!

18:07.667 --> 18:09.625
Are you hungry? Should I get you some food?

18:09.667 --> 18:11.250
- That's great!
- I'm starving.

18:11.292 --> 18:12.667
Ok, wait a little. Bye for now.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.458
Thank you!

18:15.583 --> 18:16.583
You prick!

18:17.083 --> 18:18.417
Watch your tongue.

18:21.417 --> 18:25.167
After <i>7</i> days of ambush,
we finally caught the rapist.

18:25.208 --> 18:29.167
Evidence indicates the rapist was involved

18:29.208 --> 18:30.542
in 15 similar cases in Shau Kei Wan District.

18:31.667 --> 18:32.208
Sir.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.042
Move it!

18:33.083 --> 18:33.708
Open the gate.

18:33.750 --> 18:34.375
Open the gate!

18:34.417 --> 18:35.458
Open it!

18:36.708 --> 18:37.708
Brother Ho.

18:41.417 --> 18:42.625
Shit. This is gonna suck.

18:42.667 --> 18:45.458
Listen to me, don't you say anything.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.208
Just let me deal with it.

18:46.250 --> 18:46.750
Ok. Fine.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.375
It's gonna be fine.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.083
Understood.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.583
Open the gate, alright?

18:53.667 --> 18:54.833
That's him.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.125
Open the gate.

18:58.625 --> 18:59.750
Do you remember me?

18:59.792 --> 19:00.500
Do you remember him?

19:00.542 --> 19:02.125
Do you remember my face?

19:02.167 --> 19:03.417
Do you like to hit policemen?

19:03.458 --> 19:04.125
Sorry, sorry.

19:04.167 --> 19:04.833
What's he saying?

19:04.875 --> 19:05.583
Speak English to him!

19:05.625 --> 19:06.333
Do you remember me?

19:06.375 --> 19:07.083
I don't speak English.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.625
What's he saying? Speak English!

19:08.667 --> 19:09.708
Hello!

19:09.917 --> 19:10.667
Sorry. Sorry.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.167
Oh, he's sorry?

19:12.208 --> 19:13.083
Sorry.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.417
He's sorry.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.458
Okay, I'll make you sorry, too.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.083
Hey, the cops are beating people! Help!

19:31.125 --> 19:31.917
Stop it!

19:33.708 --> 19:35.708
Shit, stop!

19:37.500 --> 19:38.292
Stop it! Help! Stop it...!

19:38.333 --> 19:40.125
Shut up! Shut up!

19:40.333 --> 19:41.208
Stop it!

19:42.833 --> 19:48.083
The cops are attacking people!

19:48.125 --> 19:49.167
Shut up!

20:01.708 --> 20:02.917
Here, give me that.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Stop, stop.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.625
No! Stop!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.292
Oh, I didn't know you were here, sir.

20:11.958 --> 20:12.833
You should have told me!

20:12.875 --> 20:14.292
Stop taking pictures.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.667
Get out of here!

20:15.708 --> 20:17.000
You're busted. You still wanna hang around?

20:17.042 --> 20:19.333
There's nothing to see here. Go on, get out.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.000
That's right. Let the Superintendent leave now.
Let me deal with this.

20:22.042 --> 20:24.458
Put the cameras down. Put them down.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.708
Just get out, alright. Open the gate.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.833
I know exactly what you're doing.

20:36.375 --> 20:37.833
And you won't get away with it.

20:38.458 --> 20:39.500
Goodbye, sir.

20:39.583 --> 20:40.750
Goodbye to you.

20:45.000 --> 20:45.667
Jan.

20:45.708 --> 20:46.583
Yes.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.125
Help me take care of this.

20:48.167 --> 20:49.000
Ok.

20:49.542 --> 20:50.500
Come inside.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.833
Did you put the film in? No film, right?

20:53.917 --> 20:55.083
You asked us not to load them.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.000
That's right. Congratulations everyone.

20:57.042 --> 20:59.208
200 dollars each. Because it's my birthday.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.083
Come and get it.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.542
Thank you, Brother Piggy!

21:04.333 --> 21:05.375
Get him to a hospital.

21:05.417 --> 21:06.250
Okay.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.542
It's all because of you.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.125
You should have let them go when I asked.

21:10.292 --> 21:12.250
Rules are rules.

21:22.833 --> 21:24.000
May...

21:29.667 --> 21:30.667
Ho!

21:31.667 --> 21:33.625
Help! Help! Don't scare me, Ho!

21:34.125 --> 21:35.250
Are you ok?

21:36.625 --> 21:37.417
May...

21:37.458 --> 21:38.667
Mr. Ho?

21:39.708 --> 21:40.875
Mr. Ho?

21:42.208 --> 21:43.542
Are you feeling better?

21:47.208 --> 21:48.250
Be careful.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.667
Be careful. Your rib cage is injured.
Let me help you.

21:49.708 --> 21:50.708
Nurse,

21:51.583 --> 21:53.625
who brought me here?

21:53.708 --> 21:56.542
Lee Rock. Are you a friend of his?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.125
He's very nice to you.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.000
Where are my friends?

22:00.042 --> 22:01.333
They're in the next room.

22:01.375 --> 22:02.458
Brother Ho.

22:03.292 --> 22:04.083
Are you all okay?

22:04.125 --> 22:05.042
We're fine!

22:05.125 --> 22:06.125
We're fine.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.542
Brother Piggy is hereto see you.

22:08.625 --> 22:09.500
Brother Piggy.

22:09.875 --> 22:10.875
Brother Piggy.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.208
Hello, Miss Jane.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.208
Hey, how are you? Any better?

22:14.875 --> 22:17.125
I'm fine. I'm fine.

22:17.167 --> 22:19.625
Brother Rock asked me to bring

22:19.667 --> 22:21.542
you some bonds for your expenses.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.750
500 in bonds is 500 in cash?

22:25.500 --> 22:28.375
Wow, Brother Ho, this is our big break!

22:28.417 --> 22:31.833
Yes, Piggy said Rock
would get us some big business.

22:32.583 --> 22:35.958
Rest well. When you get better,
a world of money will be waiting for you.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.625
What exactly does Brother Rock want us to do for him?

22:38.667 --> 22:41.833
Be patient. You'll know when you get better.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.583
I have some business to attend to now. Gotta go.

22:44.625 --> 22:48.333
Thank you for taking all the trouble,
Piggy, please thank Rock for us. Ok?

22:48.375 --> 22:49.458
Okay, okay.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.625
Watch your step.

23:05.583 --> 23:06.750
What's going on? Why is the door open?

23:07.125 --> 23:09.042
You can't hit a woman, you ruthless animals!

23:09.083 --> 23:10.375
What's happening? What's happening?

23:10.750 --> 23:12.125
What's going on, Miss Landlady? What happened?

23:12.167 --> 23:12.833
What happened?

23:12.875 --> 23:14.667
What is it? What is it?

23:14.708 --> 23:15.917
Her dad lost a lot of money at my casino.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.250
He disappeared, so I'm taking her away as payment!

23:17.292 --> 23:19.500
Wait a minute. Sorry, I missed your name.

23:19.542 --> 23:20.500
Badass Jack!

23:20.542 --> 23:21.375
Brother Jack?

23:21.417 --> 23:22.500
This agreement states to give her up.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.667
Let me look at it.

23:26.458 --> 23:27.375
Beat them up!

23:29.042 --> 23:32.000
Don't beat us up! We're Grizzly Bear's men!

23:32.042 --> 23:34.375
Even if you save her today,
you can't protect her forever!

23:35.417 --> 23:37.000
You shit-face dirtbag!

23:37.792 --> 23:39.583
He said he's with Grizzly!

23:40.042 --> 23:41.333
Oh, I'm so scared!

23:42.375 --> 23:43.792
He owes us money.

23:43.833 --> 23:46.583
You've gotta pay us back something!

23:47.083 --> 23:48.208
- How much does he owe you?
- He owes me $ 9,700.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.417
So it's $9,700?

23:53.917 --> 23:56.083
Come, where's the money Rock gave you?

23:56.708 --> 23:57.917
Give it to me first.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.417
Here's $700 for now.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.125
We'll get you the $9,000.

24:06.750 --> 24:07.750
How can I trust you?

24:07.792 --> 24:08.417
You don't trust me?

24:08.458 --> 24:10.500
Well you have <i>2</i> choices... you can trust me,

24:10.542 --> 24:12.417
or I can beat the hell out of you.

24:12.958 --> 24:13.958
Understand?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.250
Ok, you have one month to get the money.

24:16.292 --> 24:17.375
Let's go!

24:21.750 --> 24:24.583
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid!
Everything's fine.

24:26.542 --> 24:30.625
Robert, you have to make an effort
in courting Sir Chow's daughter.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.667
My promotion to Chief Detective counts on you.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.583
Oh, what is that burn doing here?

24:42.708 --> 24:43.625
How did you get in here?

24:43.667 --> 24:45.125
This isn't a place for you.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.167
I was invited.

24:48.792 --> 24:50.958
See how grand this party is? Who invited you?

24:51.625 --> 24:52.833
I don't expect you to know Sir Chow...?

24:52.875 --> 24:54.750
Hm, I guess I kinda know him.

24:54.792 --> 24:58.958
Ladies and gentleman. Welcome! Welcome.

25:04.833 --> 25:09.000
And now, I would like to introduce
a very good friend of my daughter's.

25:09.042 --> 25:11.500
A distinguished member of the community.

25:11.542 --> 25:17.083
Well educated.
A very presentable young man with a bright future.

25:17.542 --> 25:18.542
What is he talking about?

25:19.125 --> 25:22.458
He said his daughter is 24.
She likes successful gentlemen...

25:22.833 --> 25:24.875
- Somebody like me.
- Stop bluffing!

25:24.917 --> 25:26.875
He is introducing his future son-in-law.

25:26.917 --> 25:28.833
Who is it? Is he talking about you?

25:29.542 --> 25:32.542
May I invite Sergeant Major Lee Rock to the stage!

25:38.375 --> 25:41.958
And next month, these two will be engaged.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.750
Please join us at the engagement party
when you receive your invitation.

25:46.125 --> 25:46.708
Sir.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.167
Recently, I heard Lee Rock has been
dating Sir Chow's daughter.

25:49.875 --> 25:53.250
Do you think Sir Chow will help him
get promoted to Chief Detective?

25:53.667 --> 25:54.833
I don't think he's qualified.

25:54.875 --> 25:59.583
London quarter has decided not to add the position
of Chief Detective at the moment.

26:00.042 --> 26:01.542
I've spent so much money on it already...

26:01.583 --> 26:04.708
Don't worry.
You'll be the first choice if it opens up.

26:05.542 --> 26:08.958
Look, I have something I need to discuss with you.

26:09.833 --> 26:12.250
The detective in Wan Chai has passed away.

26:12.292 --> 26:14.542
Rock needs this position no matter what.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.208
That rogue... What skills does he have 
apart from sponging off women?

26:19.708 --> 26:22.167
He wants to sit in the Chief Detective's chair
in the most lucrative district?

26:22.208 --> 26:23.167
He can dream on!

26:23.208 --> 26:25.125
There's only one way to get him off.

26:27.167 --> 26:28.708
You take his place.

26:30.375 --> 26:33.667
Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai
are both profitable districts.

26:34.792 --> 26:36.542
Although I live in Kowloon,

26:36.583 --> 26:39.708
lam willing to move
to stop this rogue from climbing up.

26:39.750 --> 26:40.792
Thank you, sir.

26:41.417 --> 26:43.708
So who'll take my place
in the Yau Ma Tei/Tsim Sha Tsui area?

26:44.917 --> 26:46.375
He'll replace you.

26:47.333 --> 26:48.292
Him?

26:48.333 --> 26:49.042
Sir!

26:49.083 --> 26:51.125
Didn't you just say yes?

26:51.833 --> 26:52.750
Yes.

26:52.792 --> 26:53.708
What?

26:53.750 --> 26:57.250
Ah, he's just agreed to
take over the Wan Chai post.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.208
Did he?

26:59.250 --> 27:00.417
Yeah, good news, right?

27:00.458 --> 27:02.417
Sir Ngan, are you serious about that?

27:02.458 --> 27:04.208
You live in Kowloon.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.167
If you work on Hong Kong Island,
you'll have to take the ferry every day.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.375
You don't get motion sickness, do you?

27:11.417 --> 27:13.833
You sponger! Don't get too cocky!

27:13.875 --> 27:15.083
Watch your mouth.

27:16.667 --> 27:17.708
Sorry, sir.

27:17.750 --> 27:20.500
Hey, Rock! Come on, let's play!

27:20.542 --> 27:22.458
It's okay! Excuse me.

27:36.292 --> 27:37.958
Get out of the way!

27:44.125 --> 27:45.583
Hey, buddy!

27:45.708 --> 27:46.833
I'm looking for Chubby.

27:47.792 --> 27:48.875
Brother Chubby!

27:53.458 --> 27:54.875
Son of a bitch,

27:54.917 --> 27:55.833
this stinks!

27:58.000 --> 27:58.708
What?

27:58.750 --> 28:00.583
You dare hit me?

28:00.875 --> 28:03.500
What? What?

28:03.917 --> 28:04.708
Brother Chubby!

28:04.750 --> 28:06.292
- Brother Chubby!
- Stop!

28:06.750 --> 28:07.667
Let him in.

28:21.875 --> 28:22.917
Brother Chubby.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.833
Let's relax and talk about this.

28:26.667 --> 28:27.958
Let go of my buddy first. Okay?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.458
I had a bet with my guys,

28:30.500 --> 28:33.417
that when you arrived,
you'd say those exact words.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.042
I won!

28:36.292 --> 28:37.917
You each owe me $100.

28:37.958 --> 28:39.083
Yes.

28:39.125 --> 28:41.667
Today was the first day this dirtbag
started working for me,

28:41.708 --> 28:43.083
and he's already stolen from me!

28:43.125 --> 28:46.000
And being a complete moron, he went to one
of my casinos to use the money.

28:46.042 --> 28:47.583
If he hadn't gambled away all the money
and made a scene,

28:47.625 --> 28:48.625
I'd never have known.

28:48.667 --> 28:50.250
And that would've made me lose face, wouldn't it?

29:11.417 --> 29:12.500
Please accept my apologies.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.125
You think slamming those bottles
on your head will impress me?

29:14.792 --> 29:16.667
My men do that everyday.

29:16.708 --> 29:19.042
Should I ask them to show you?

29:19.333 --> 29:20.542
So you broke a few bottles on your head,

29:20.583 --> 29:21.583
and I'm supposed to set him free?

29:21.625 --> 29:23.083
That would make your life too easy.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.375
Well, I need some people to work for me.

29:25.625 --> 29:26.958
What do you have in mind, Brother Chubby?

29:27.000 --> 29:28.667
I heard you're a good fighter.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.417
But I don't know if it's true or fake.

29:59.917 --> 30:00.792
Hey!

30:01.167 --> 30:02.083
Hey!

30:04.167 --> 30:05.000
Hey, hey, hey!

30:05.042 --> 30:05.750
Stop, Stop!

30:05.792 --> 30:06.917
Hey! Stop! There are rules in our field!

30:06.958 --> 30:08.958
One on one! Just one on one!

30:14.000 --> 30:15.583
Get up, scumbag!

30:15.625 --> 30:17.375
Hit him! Hit him!

30:22.417 --> 30:24.542
Get up! Get up!

30:38.250 --> 30:40.917
Stop, stop, Stop!

30:45.625 --> 30:47.167
Stop right now!

30:47.333 --> 30:48.708
Stop fighting! Ok!

30:55.250 --> 30:56.333
You want some more?

30:56.958 --> 30:58.083
Brother Chubby,

30:59.542 --> 31:00.708
am I qualified?

31:01.167 --> 31:02.625
You work for me from now on!

31:03.167 --> 31:05.167
I promise you as many chicks as you want,
and as much money as you want.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.208
I don't need women!

31:08.500 --> 31:09.708
I need 10 thousand bucks.

31:10.542 --> 31:11.375
What?

31:11.417 --> 31:12.833
I take 10 thousand from you today.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.000
But tomorrow I will make $100,000 for you.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.708
You're a greedy son of a bitch... just like me.

31:20.292 --> 31:21.542
I like it!

31:25.083 --> 31:26.375
But remember,

31:27.292 --> 31:29.000
don't you be like this dirtbag.

31:29.375 --> 31:31.875
Or I'll break your legs.

31:34.625 --> 31:35.708
Let's go!

31:37.167 --> 31:38.208
Come on, bro.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.333
Okay, it's okay.

32:07.125 --> 32:07.833
Brother Ho.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.208
Shut up!

32:11.125 --> 32:12.125
Wayne,

32:14.250 --> 32:17.250
take $9000 to Badass Jack.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.667
Yes.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.458
Do you even know how to play?

33:16.583 --> 33:17.708
Here's a coke for you!

33:18.083 --> 33:19.208
Thank you, big brother.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.042
Since I started working for Chubby,

33:22.083 --> 33:23.917
my livelihood has been centered
around Kowloon Walled City.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.958
Kowloon Walled City is a no man's land.

33:27.458 --> 33:29.458
It's a grey area in the Treaty of Nanking.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.042
The British have given up on this place.

33:32.083 --> 33:34.125
Drugs, gambling, prostitution,

33:34.167 --> 33:36.167
and the dog meat business have flourished.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.542
It's a place Hong Kong law cannot touch.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.333
Not even the police dare set foot in this area,

33:40.375 --> 33:41.792
lest they not make it out.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.125
Brother Ho.

33:43.167 --> 33:44.458
Brother Ho.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.000
Hello, Brother Ho.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.583
Hey, Chad.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.167
Where's Will?

34:12.167 --> 34:13.250
Don't touch my shoulders!

34:28.917 --> 34:29.750
I'm sorry!

34:30.333 --> 34:31.458
I'm sorry! Brother Ho, I'm sorry!

34:31.917 --> 34:33.000
What are you doing?

34:34.375 --> 34:35.708
You wanna die?

34:36.125 --> 34:37.375
I'm sorry.

34:40.583 --> 34:42.625
Don't you remember the last time you stole money?

34:42.708 --> 34:45.292
Yes,
do.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.208
Do you want to stay here
for the rest of your life?

34:47.250 --> 34:48.208
No, I don't.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.833
What about your granny in China?

34:50.333 --> 34:52.375
You promised to build a big house for her!

34:55.792 --> 34:56.542
Remember that!

34:56.583 --> 34:57.542
- I will.
- Is that clear?

34:57.583 --> 34:59.792
It's clear. It's clear.

35:01.042 --> 35:02.333
Where's Wayne?

35:02.375 --> 35:03.667
He's working.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.292
The fourth row.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.000
Hey!

35:13.042 --> 35:15.625
Four-eyes! I haven't seen you before.
What are you doing here?

35:16.375 --> 35:17.417
I want to buy that.

35:17.458 --> 35:18.375
1 dollar.

35:19.708 --> 35:21.042
Don't sell it to him!

35:21.750 --> 35:22.667
What are you doing?

35:23.958 --> 35:25.792
You stupid four-eyes.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.167
Look, do you want to end up like him?

35:29.208 --> 35:29.833
No!

35:29.875 --> 35:32.542
The drugs have taken over him.
You wanna be like this junkie?

35:32.583 --> 35:33.542
No!

35:33.750 --> 35:35.750
One sniff of this will ruin your life!

35:35.792 --> 35:38.208
Listen, don't let me see you back here again.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.917
And don't let me find out
you're going elsewhere to get it,

35:39.958 --> 35:41.375
or I'll break your legs!

35:41.417 --> 35:42.542
- Understand?
- Yes!

35:42.750 --> 35:43.750
Get your money back and go.

35:43.792 --> 35:44.583
Beat it!

35:44.625 --> 35:45.667
Beat it!

35:46.125 --> 35:46.917
Brother Ho,

35:46.958 --> 35:48.167
why don't you want to make money?

35:48.208 --> 35:49.417
We are trying to make a living--

35:49.458 --> 35:50.625
We are trying to make a living...

35:53.292 --> 35:55.458
I know, we have bottom lines!

35:56.458 --> 35:58.208
There's no need to raise your voice.

36:58.333 --> 36:59.458
Do you want to cut it?

36:59.500 --> 37:00.792
Yes, I do, Dad.

37:00.833 --> 37:04.625
Come, let me show you.
Look, right in the middle.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.917
You're so smart

37:07.042 --> 37:07.750
You're so smart.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.292
Morn, I want the egg yolk.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.125
Brother Jan!

37:14.208 --> 37:15.417
How are you?

37:15.958 --> 37:16.792
Happy Moon Festival!

37:16.833 --> 37:17.583
- How are you?
- Please sit.

37:17.625 --> 37:18.333
I'm so happy to see you, Brother Jan.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.208
Please sit.

37:21.042 --> 37:22.875
It's the Moon Festival today.

37:22.917 --> 37:25.083
I got you some moon cakes.

37:25.125 --> 37:26.500
As a token of respect for you.

37:27.333 --> 37:28.458
Got you some nice liquor too...

37:29.708 --> 37:31.250
I cannot accept this.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.958
I'm a civil servant.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.958
Come on, it's the Moon Festival today.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.542
They're just moon cakes. Please take them.

37:37.917 --> 37:38.917
In that case,

37:39.583 --> 37:41.042
I will just take this box.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.542
You can take the rest home.

37:42.583 --> 37:43.375
Thank you for your kindness.

37:43.417 --> 37:45.583
Brother Jan, I will always remember

37:45.625 --> 37:47.083
how you helped me last time.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.625
In fact, I've always wanted

37:49.667 --> 37:50.875
to find a chance to pay you back.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.333
You don't have to.

37:58.250 --> 37:59.750
This is for the kids...

37:59.792 --> 38:00.708
No, no, no!

38:00.750 --> 38:01.875
- Please, take this.
- I can't take your money.

38:01.917 --> 38:03.000
It's fine, it's fine.

38:03.042 --> 38:04.042
Why are you doing this?

38:04.083 --> 38:04.833
I'm not taking it!

38:04.875 --> 38:07.042
It's nothing, don't worry about it!

38:07.083 --> 38:08.667
I said I don't want your money!

38:12.375 --> 38:15.458
So you dress nicely
and have loads of money to spend.

38:15.833 --> 38:18.375
Tell me, have you been selling drugs

38:18.417 --> 38:20.250
for Chubby lately?

38:20.292 --> 38:21.250
Tell me!

38:21.667 --> 38:22.708
I'm just trying to make a living.

38:23.958 --> 38:25.667
I don't care if you admit it or not.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.792
My colleagues have told me all about you!

38:28.458 --> 38:29.542
Let me tell you.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.125
In my 20 years of being a cop,

38:31.167 --> 38:33.000
I have never accepted any bribes--not a single cent!

38:33.042 --> 38:35.667
That's why I will not take your dirty money.

38:36.958 --> 38:39.417
Take all your presents back, and get out of here!

38:39.833 --> 38:40.750
Brother Jan...

38:40.792 --> 38:42.667
If you're not leaving, I will!

38:57.958 --> 38:59.292
In this world,

38:59.333 --> 39:00.583
there are people who are greedy

39:00.667 --> 39:01.833
and people who are not.

39:02.625 --> 39:05.667
Jan is not the greedy kind. Just leave him alone.

39:05.750 --> 39:08.542
I'm greedy for money. Having money is good!

39:10.667 --> 39:11.917
Oh yes, Brother Rock.

39:11.958 --> 39:15.833
Last time you asked Piggy to lend us some money.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.167
Let me pay you back while you're here.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.208
Only this much?

39:20.708 --> 39:22.375
Where's the accumulated interest?
It's much more than this.

39:22.667 --> 39:24.333
Keep that money for now.

39:24.375 --> 39:27.042
See it as a deposit.
You come to me when I need you.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.958
I will definitely come to you!

39:31.458 --> 39:32.292
Remember that.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.333
You have my word!

39:35.542 --> 39:36.500
Thank you, Brother Rock.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.417
You have my word.

39:58.292 --> 40:01.208
Yay, bravo! Bravo, Brother Chubby!

40:02.667 --> 40:03.875
Bravo, Brother Chubby!

40:25.250 --> 40:26.458
Bottoms up!

40:27.250 --> 40:28.583
My apologies about last time.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.500
Hey buddy! With you on my team,

40:33.542 --> 40:36.708
I'm like a tiger with wings!

40:37.500 --> 40:39.458
You're the boss, you're the boss.

40:39.833 --> 40:41.125
Come, let's drink some more.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.042
Hey, step on it. We're gonna be late!

40:51.083 --> 40:53.750
We're picking up Brother Ho's wife. Go faster!

40:54.292 --> 40:57.667
Morn, I'm really hungry. Are we almost there?

40:58.333 --> 41:00.500
Yes, we are. Dad will meet us at the pier.

41:03.750 --> 41:05.792
Hey brother...
it looks like the marine police are ahead.

41:05.833 --> 41:07.417
Attention, everyone!

41:07.458 --> 41:08.917
We are the Marine Police.

41:09.042 --> 41:10.833
Shut off your engine and prepare to be searched.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.458
The cops are here! Move to the stern, quickly!

41:12.542 --> 41:15.042
Jump into the water, jump! Hurry, jump!

41:28.167 --> 41:29.583
I don't feel well...

41:31.042 --> 41:32.167
I don't feel well...

41:38.417 --> 41:39.667
I don't feel well!

41:58.625 --> 42:00.042
What are we doing boys?

42:02.458 --> 42:03.958
- What did he say?
- No idea.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.917
Standing around with our hands in the air.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.000
Help!

42:07.708 --> 42:08.833
Stop yapping!

42:12.125 --> 42:13.333
Help!

42:15.667 --> 42:16.667
Help!

42:17.458 --> 42:18.958
Help!

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
Help...

42:20.042 --> 42:21.042
My wife gave me that necklace!

42:21.208 --> 42:23.500
Don't you fucking test me!

42:25.667 --> 42:28.000
Please help us, help!

42:32.333 --> 42:34.083
Hey Bro, you've screwed up!

42:34.125 --> 42:35.500
Look at the lipstick on your collar!

42:35.542 --> 42:36.292
Are you serious?

42:36.375 --> 42:38.292
You're playing tricks on me, huh?

42:38.333 --> 42:39.583
I know what you were doing

42:39.625 --> 42:41.458
with that chick in the toilet!

43:23.250 --> 43:25.083
How could this happen!

43:26.167 --> 43:27.875
Why did anybody have to die?

43:29.125 --> 43:31.083
I have to take her home!

43:32.333 --> 43:34.208
Why did anyone have to die?

43:35.750 --> 43:38.417
How did this happen!

43:41.167 --> 43:41.958
How did this happen!

43:42.000 --> 43:43.583
How did it end up like this!

43:43.625 --> 43:48.708
Hey, what happened!
Hey! How did this happen!

44:23.042 --> 44:25.500
"Six months later"

44:26.917 --> 44:29.458
The mess Comic and Grizzly Bear stirred up
is getting worse and worse.

44:29.875 --> 44:31.375
First it was the huge fight a while back.

44:31.417 --> 44:32.583
And now they're playing guerrilla warfare.

44:32.625 --> 44:35.125
More than 20 are dead, and more than 50 injured.

44:35.167 --> 44:36.875
The bosses are complaining about it.

44:36.917 --> 44:38.292
So what do the big guys want?

44:42.625 --> 44:44.500
It's supposed to be a decent drug business.

44:47.167 --> 44:48.833
Now it's a mess. How can we go on like this?

44:51.500 --> 44:53.458
You want to throw it out?
Clean it up and start over?

44:53.500 --> 44:54.792
That's exactly what I meant.

44:54.833 --> 44:56.417
But if we take them out by the root,

44:56.458 --> 44:58.458
Chubby will become the only dominant party.

44:58.500 --> 45:01.417
If Chubby is nice and compliant,
we'll leave his share alone.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.417
But Comic and Grizzly Bear have to be replaced.

45:04.458 --> 45:05.833
Who do you have in mind for their replacement?

45:07.667 --> 45:08.833
How about Will?

45:12.625 --> 45:13.375
Who are you?

45:13.417 --> 45:14.667
Looks like you are Grizzly's favorite buddy...

45:14.708 --> 45:16.417
While he's busy gambling in Temple Street,

45:16.458 --> 45:17.833
you step in to take care of his wife.

45:17.875 --> 45:18.875
What do you want?

45:35.375 --> 45:36.667
What's going on?

45:41.333 --> 45:43.917
Grizzly's just a daredevil loner.
That part is easy.

45:44.458 --> 45:47.042
But Comic is the nephew of Master Dane,
a veteran of the Walled City.

45:47.083 --> 45:49.750
If we touch him,
I fear it'll cause some chaos in the Kowloon district.

45:49.792 --> 45:51.542
Let me pay Master Dane a visit in the Walled City.

45:51.667 --> 45:52.667
No, no, no.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.167
That's too risky.
You can't just walk in there.

45:54.208 --> 45:55.750
If he's unhappy, he can burn you alive
and nobody would know.

45:56.750 --> 45:58.625
Let's get Ho and his buddies to help?

45:58.667 --> 46:00.875
His wife just died. Let's leave him alone for now.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.042
You're right.

46:02.083 --> 46:04.042
Ever since his wife died, he's gone nuts.

46:04.125 --> 46:06.667
He just sits there every day.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.917
We can't count on him.

46:22.458 --> 46:23.708
The third row.

46:29.875 --> 46:34.208
You think we were just bluffing, you junkie?

46:34.250 --> 46:34.875
No.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.042
Or is your memory failing you?

46:36.083 --> 46:37.542
I do remember... yes... I remember...

46:37.583 --> 46:39.000
What did I say to you last time?

46:39.042 --> 46:39.750
Don't buy, don't buy, don't buy!

46:39.917 --> 46:40.833
I told you not to come here anymore

46:40.875 --> 46:42.250
or I'd break your legs!

46:43.417 --> 46:45.042
Do you have any regard for your own life?

46:45.125 --> 46:47.125
Just a small hit!

46:47.250 --> 46:48.458
Why are those three together?

46:48.500 --> 46:51.583
Just a small hit! Please, Brother Wayne!

46:53.292 --> 46:54.250
Get up!

46:54.625 --> 46:55.375
You want dope?

46:55.417 --> 46:56.500
Yes, yes, yes!

46:56.542 --> 46:59.167
Get over there and eavesdrop on that bald dude.

46:59.208 --> 47:00.292
- Yes.
- Go!

47:00.750 --> 47:03.125
We're on it. Don't you worry about a thing.

47:03.167 --> 47:05.833
If that bastard dares to set foot in here,

47:05.875 --> 47:07.583
he'll be dead meat.

47:07.750 --> 47:08.833
As simple as that.

47:10.125 --> 47:11.917
Master Dane always listens to me.

47:11.958 --> 47:14.750
After today, you will never see Lee Rock again.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.333
Ok, all set.

47:17.292 --> 47:18.500
Do I have to wear this?

47:19.875 --> 47:22.083
- Sure. Look at it! It's good, very sturdy.
- It's like I'm armed for war.

47:22.125 --> 47:24.458
It's always good to play it safe.
If nothing happens, then you're lucky!

47:24.500 --> 47:26.875
But if something does happen,
at least you'll be ready for it.

47:30.167 --> 47:31.500
Hurry up, please.

47:32.708 --> 47:33.458
What is that?

47:33.500 --> 47:34.542
A gun!

47:34.833 --> 47:36.042
I know that's a gun.

47:36.083 --> 47:37.167
But what about this one?

47:39.833 --> 47:40.833
This is a flare gun.

47:40.875 --> 47:41.792
If you feel something is wrong, shoot it

47:41.833 --> 47:43.208
and we'll rush in.

47:45.583 --> 47:47.333
Whatever you say...!

47:56.000 --> 47:57.125
Brother Rock.

47:57.458 --> 47:58.583
I'll say it again...

47:58.625 --> 48:00.500
Fire the flare gun if you need us,
and we'll rush in.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.375
Comic has gathered all his men in the Walled City.

48:32.417 --> 48:33.625
They're all armed.

48:34.125 --> 48:36.875
And Chubby has also lined up
a bunch of his men in here.

49:42.417 --> 49:44.000
I have an appointment with Master Dane!

49:44.042 --> 49:45.042
Sergeant Major Lee,

49:45.708 --> 49:47.125
it's good to see you again!

49:47.708 --> 49:49.250
The premium tea leaves you sent last time...

49:49.292 --> 49:51.042
We can't stop praising how good they are.

49:56.458 --> 49:58.917
If the elders like it, I can send some everyday.

49:59.542 --> 50:00.750
Please come up, let's talk!

50:00.792 --> 50:01.792
Of course.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.625
Excuse me.

50:03.667 --> 50:05.000
Please make way.

50:27.542 --> 50:28.667
Sergeant Major Lee,

50:29.167 --> 50:30.500
we can start now.

50:30.583 --> 50:31.042
Please.

50:31.125 --> 50:34.625
Uncle, these cops are
always taking advantage of us.

50:34.667 --> 50:35.958
You'd better be careful.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.125
You shut up and get down on your knees!

50:42.333 --> 50:46.125
The Walled City gang
and the gangs outside never mess with each other.

50:46.667 --> 50:48.792
That's the rule nobody breaks.

50:48.833 --> 50:52.208
Now look at the mess you and Grizzly stirred up!

50:53.083 --> 50:56.042
Sergeant Major Lee has to come here
in person to demand the culprit.

50:56.083 --> 50:58.167
Now you tell me, what should I do?

51:01.208 --> 51:02.208
Bro,

51:03.458 --> 51:05.542
all the exits at Master Dane's base are blocked.

51:05.583 --> 51:07.083
We can't get in.

51:21.750 --> 51:25.375
Elders, I want to replace
the leader of the Walled City.

51:25.417 --> 51:27.167
I didn't do it, Uncle Dane!

51:27.208 --> 51:28.250
No?

51:28.292 --> 51:29.917
You think I'm totally in the dark?

51:29.958 --> 51:32.917
You broke the rules!
You should've expected this outcome!

51:34.250 --> 51:35.208
Sergeant Major Lee!

51:35.250 --> 51:37.042
Regarding the replacement, 
I will account for it...

51:59.125 --> 52:00.167
Get him!

52:00.583 --> 52:02.000
Stop! Stop! Stop!

52:02.917 --> 52:04.917
Lee Rock murdered Master Dane!

52:05.708 --> 52:08.500
Yes, Lee Rock murdered Master Dane!

52:08.542 --> 52:09.625
Yes, Yes!

52:09.667 --> 52:11.208
Lee Rock killed Master Dane!

52:17.708 --> 52:19.542
Listen up, no one gets out of here!

52:19.750 --> 52:21.125
Stop running!

52:21.792 --> 52:23.833
Here! Stop running!

52:44.792 --> 52:46.000
This way. Stop running!

52:46.083 --> 52:46.958
That Way!

53:09.333 --> 53:10.417
Get him!

53:39.125 --> 53:40.167
That Way!

53:54.375 --> 53:56.167
Brother Rock... it's me, Ho...

53:59.667 --> 54:04.583
Ho, I've lost my flare gun.

54:05.000 --> 54:05.625
Without it I can't alert the people outside.

54:05.708 --> 54:06.875
Let's go.

54:43.667 --> 54:44.958
That Way, go get him!

54:45.750 --> 54:46.708
Let's go, quickly!

54:51.458 --> 54:52.917
Come on! Come on!

54:55.208 --> 54:56.500
Brother Ho, don't try to help him.
You can't afford the consequences!

54:56.542 --> 54:59.125
That's my business. 
Show a little respect, okay?

54:59.583 --> 55:00.958
Back off, back off!

55:01.542 --> 55:03.125
Don't you dare move! Stay right there!

55:03.167 --> 55:04.250
Don't come any closer!

55:04.292 --> 55:06.375
I'll kill anyone who tries to get near.

55:09.792 --> 55:11.125
Don't come close!

55:12.000 --> 55:13.042
Don't come close!

55:14.333 --> 55:15.167
Come on!

55:16.167 --> 55:17.167
Come on!

55:18.458 --> 55:20.458
In our business, loyalty is most important!

55:20.500 --> 55:23.958
Lee Rock saved me from the hands
of the ruthless British cops.

55:25.125 --> 55:26.250
So I have to repay him!

55:26.875 --> 55:28.917
If someone offers you kindness when 
you're in need, you're indebted for life.

55:28.958 --> 55:31.167
Did your parents not teach you?

55:31.250 --> 55:32.208
Did they?

55:33.125 --> 55:34.292
Did they?

55:39.125 --> 55:40.875
If you can spare Brother Rock today,

55:41.875 --> 55:44.042
I, Ho, will pay you back for sure!

55:46.167 --> 55:47.625
Who cares about getting paid back!

55:48.500 --> 55:49.667
Kill them!

56:18.958 --> 56:21.417
Huh, just some stupid fireworks,
not the flare gun...

56:35.167 --> 56:36.375
That Way!

57:31.625 --> 57:32.708
Come on!

57:39.417 --> 57:40.542
If you're not afraid of dying...

57:41.083 --> 57:44.833
Come on! Come on!

57:48.750 --> 57:49.792
Come on!

57:50.292 --> 57:51.833
You bastards! Come on!

58:18.500 --> 58:19.750
Pick him up!

58:23.792 --> 58:25.333
You deserve this, you rogue!

58:28.083 --> 58:31.708
I trusted you,

58:31.750 --> 58:33.917
and you betrayed me.

58:33.958 --> 58:36.583
Go to hell, go to hell!

58:36.667 --> 58:38.750
You wanna be a damn hero?

58:39.083 --> 58:40.125
You get your wish!

58:40.417 --> 58:42.375
Go to hell, go to hell!

58:43.167 --> 58:44.667
Be a hero!

59:13.333 --> 59:14.542
Stupid cop!

59:17.708 --> 59:18.750
Comic!

59:20.792 --> 59:21.958
Brother Rock!

59:24.042 --> 59:27.208
Rock! Are you okay?

59:27.250 --> 59:28.833
Let's get you to a hospital. Come!

59:28.917 --> 59:29.875
Ho...

59:29.917 --> 59:30.833
Yes, sir!

59:30.875 --> 59:31.625
Keep an eye on Brother Rock

59:31.667 --> 59:32.708
Yes, sir!

59:34.208 --> 59:36.875
Oh, my goodness! What a mess you're in!

59:42.667 --> 59:44.875
He's lost a lot of blood.
Let's give him a 100cc blood transfusion for now.

59:45.875 --> 59:47.375
The patient's lower leg bone is half broken.

59:47.417 --> 59:48.667
The knee cap is dislocated.

59:49.083 --> 59:50.292
Looks like we have to cut it off.

59:52.208 --> 59:53.542
Even if we can save the leg,

59:53.625 --> 59:55.042
he'll be walking with
one leg shorter than the other.

59:55.083 --> 59:56.250
He'll be a cripple.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:54.833
This isn't the end of it.

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:00.292
You get some rest. I have to go.

01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:33.958
Piggy!

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.708
When did you see me break Ho's leg?

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:39.125
We found these bags in your car. Your car!

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:40.208
Are you setting me up?

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.625
I'm treating you to a special milk tea.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:45.125
Here you are.

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:46.250
Stop messing around!

01:01:46.292 --> 01:01:46.875
This can kill me!

01:01:46.917 --> 01:01:48.125
That's exactly what I intend.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.000
You can stay here tonight

01:01:54.042 --> 01:01:56.083
and get so sick you wish you'd never lived.

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:00.250
You're still not talking?

01:02:00.292 --> 01:02:01.708
Okay, we'll wait outside.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.542
Hey, hey! I confess! I confess!

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:58.917
I said it before.

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:02.250
Whatever I get in the future, you will get half.

01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:33.083
In 1965, Brother Rock really did share
half of his kingdom with me.

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:37.375
He centralized money collection and 
distribution amongst the cops and the triads,

01:03:37.417 --> 01:03:41.417
so there'd be no arguments.

01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:44.458
Those were good, profitable years
for both the cops and the triads.

01:03:44.792 --> 01:03:47.917
We made a lot of money and bought a lot of houses.

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:51.125
People said that Brother Rock
owned 500 million dollars,

01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:52.875
more than Li Ka Shing.

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:11.833
Our kingdom is divided into good and bad.

01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:14.875
I'm the good cop and you're the dirty drug lord.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.083
Let me give you some advice.

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:22.583
You see, out there in Hong Kong,
the British are the big shots.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.917
If you have to, you can kill me.

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:27.625
But never touch the Brits.

01:04:28.167 --> 01:04:31.625
Be patient. And this kingdom will belong to us.

01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:40.125
Well gentleman, in Texas we ain't got royalty.

01:04:40.208 --> 01:04:43.292
But the Queen of England is coming here
for the Queen Elizabeth II Cup.

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:46.833
If we can win this race,
I'll get the chance of kissing her hand.

01:04:46.875 --> 01:04:48.792
So we really gotta win that golden cup.

01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:50.833
And you, Boss, will be in the spotlight!

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.458
- Ken! Keith!
- Let's make it happen, huh!

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.708
Sir Ngan.

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:00.917
That's good.

01:05:04.042 --> 01:05:05.042
Who's he?

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:06.208
Brother Ho!

01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:07.958
Hey, Sir Ngan.

01:05:08.042 --> 01:05:09.708
I see you're dressed up.
Is it for the winners' circle picture?

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.792
No, my friend's horse is in the race today.

01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:14.000
I'm just here to observe.

01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:15.500
What's the horse's name?

01:05:15.542 --> 01:05:16.833
Mouse of the Dragon Pond.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.333
You think Mouse of the Dragon Pond will do well?

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:20.375
A rat?

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.875
That horse is a cripple, like you.

01:05:23.292 --> 01:05:25.167
How can a mouse win the race?

01:05:26.667 --> 01:05:29.792
My boss's horse, Resounding Fame,
is the number 1 horse in this race,

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:30.417
It's a sure win!

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:31.583
Oh, thank you very much!

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:33.500
Hey, looks like we have to get an extra ticket!

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.042
The last horse to be loaded is no. 4.

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:37.500
And they're all set...

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:38.833
Ngan.

01:05:38.917 --> 01:05:41.417
- Cheers! To the win!
- Ready...

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:42.833
And, away they go...

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:45.542
Jumping into the lead, Resounding Fame!

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:47.750
That little tiger is catching up from the outside.

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:49.417
Go Resounding Fame!

01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:52.292
Followed by Supreme Stallion and Great Success.

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.292
Close behind them comes Instant Fortune,

01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:55.458
and running second-to-last
of the pack is Red Sensation,

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.583
and Mouse of the Dragon Pond is last.

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:01.333
Turning into the home stretch now
is Resounding Fame.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:02.583
It seems the favorite is about to win the race.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.417
But Mouse of the Dragon Pond
is suddenly rolling up along the side

01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.833
like an express train!

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.083
- No! No!
- What the fuck!

01:06:12.333 --> 01:06:13.250
Come on now.

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:15.083
Mouse of the Dragon Pond is a stunning upset!

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:16.708
Mouse of the Dragon Pond is
the first to cross the finish line.

01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:19.500
Resounding Fame has to settle for second,

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:21.458
What in God's name have you done man?

01:06:21.542 --> 01:06:22.917
What in the hell have you done?

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:24.208
- What's going on?
- Listen, listen...

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.917
Something happened, Something happened.

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:45.833
You know how much money I make in a bloody month?

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.125
It's all on there!

01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:50.875
What am I gonna do?

01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:53.542
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:06:58.208 --> 01:06:59.583
Hey, Sir Ngan!

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.125
Your tips aren't really working.

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:04.042
I was lucky I got an extra ticket
on the horse I picked!

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:07.167
You wretched cripple.
You've got some guts to beat me to the punch!

01:07:07.292 --> 01:07:09.875
I know you bribed 11 jockeys in the race.

01:07:09.917 --> 01:07:13.833
But I bribed one... yours.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.292
Who says cripples can't win?

01:07:17.542 --> 01:07:20.125
"Entrepreneur Crippled Ho's horse,
Mouse of the Dragon Pond,"

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:21.542
"takes Queen's Cup over favorite."

01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:23.000
Brother Rock.

01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:26.333
I often recall the day
you made me raise five fingers...

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.625
What you said then has come true.

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:29.375
I wake up laughing now.

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.625
Keep a low profile.

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:31.833
Of course! Of course!

01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:32.958
One has to be content with what he already has.

01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:34.583
Oh, I applaud for what I have!

01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:38.000
But...

01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:40.208
You, on the other hand, have to keep an eye on Ho.

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:42.667
In recent years,
he hasn't been sticking with the rules.

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:45.125
He's spent a lot to bribe the cops and the gangs.

01:07:45.167 --> 01:07:47.167
He's placed moles in a lot of police divisions...

01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:48.458
even in ours.

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.667
Within 15 minutes he's notified on
everything that's happening in the division.

01:07:51.042 --> 01:07:52.667
He must be onto something.

01:07:53.042 --> 01:07:55.792
He may have plans to bite the hand that feeds him.
Be careful.

01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:36.625
The drug business isn't worth
the risk we need to expand.

01:08:37.457 --> 01:08:39.250
Two suppliers is not enough.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:40.625
We need to double it.

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:43.417
Four suppliers, then we don't take the risk.

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:45.957
I don't think it will work.

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:47.125
I don't care.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.417
Make it work.

01:08:56.292 --> 01:08:57.292
Brother Ho,

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:59.582
Chubby is being released today.
Brother Rock's sent Piggy to pick him up.

01:09:01.125 --> 01:09:03.500
As brothers, we should trust each other.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.875
There's no need to suspect
Brother Rock of anything!

01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:08.375
Yes.

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:10.917
Congrats, Brother Rock!

01:09:10.957 --> 01:09:11.500
Thank you!

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:14.707
Congratulations on your promotion
to Chief Detective, Brother Rock!

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:17.625
I couldn't have done it without your help!

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:23.875
Congratulations Chief Detective!

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.542
Here's a little present, it's not much.

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:26.042
Brother Will!

01:09:26.082 --> 01:09:27.167
Brother Ho!

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.082
Hi Sis!

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:30.875
I thought it was going to be a big party.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.332
I spent an afternoon at the salon
getting my hair done.

01:09:32.792 --> 01:09:35.167
You get your hair done everyday. Be quiet!

01:09:35.207 --> 01:09:37.042
Sis, you can leave first.

01:09:37.457 --> 01:09:38.875
Are you kidding me?

01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:41.500
You heard what Brother Rock just said.

01:09:41.875 --> 01:09:43.500
Beat it!

01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:45.875
Go!

01:09:47.125 --> 01:09:48.875
Brother Will, take a seat over here.

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:50.000
Okay.

01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:51.250
Come here, Ho.

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:54.125
This is Rose.

01:09:54.167 --> 01:09:56.292
She's known for her business
in Taiwan and Thailand.

01:09:56.375 --> 01:09:57.458
Take care of her for me.

01:09:58.333 --> 01:09:59.667
Hi, Miss Rose.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:02.958
Come here, I have something to tell you.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.958
Today is my big day.
You'll be respectful, won't you?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.500
Of course I will be.

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:18.292
He just got released today.

01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:21.417
Let's put aside your differences just for tonight.

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:24.083
I don't care what you do after tonight. Deal?

01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:27.708
Whatever you say, Brother Rock.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.625
That's right Brother Ho!

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.958
Let's not be so petty about things of the past.

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:35.250
Look at you now, your luxurious clothes...

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:37.125
even that cane looks expensive.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.167
I think you can walk faster than me now.

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:42.792
Shut your mouth.

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:48.000
Sorry about that.

01:10:49.667 --> 01:10:51.625
Now that we're all here,
how about a mahjong game?

01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:52.667
Sounds good.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.667
You know,

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:58.167
the economy in Hong Kong
is getting better and better.

01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:00.792
There's growing demand on casinos,

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.875
drugs, and brothels...

01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:07.167
It's time we consider reorganizing things.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.042
Keep a record of how many casinos,

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.292
drug houses, and brothels there are...

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:15.292
And regulate the business
so it's easier to manage.

01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:18.458
Let's talk about the drug business...

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.792
The Brits want to expand it:
they want <i>2</i> suppliers for Hong Kong,

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:24.000
and <i>2</i> suppliers for Kowloon
and the New Territories.

01:11:24.042 --> 01:11:25.375
How do you want to split it?

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:29.333
Kowloon has always been yours,
so that won't change.

01:11:29.833 --> 01:11:32.583
For Hong Kong,
Willy gets Causeway Bay to Chai Wan,

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:36.167
and Rose gets whatever's beyond
Western District. How's that?

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:38.875
Who is she to split half of my turf?

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.750
Let Ho cut her some of his share.

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:46.000
So he gets the New Territories?

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:49.583
Brother Ho, I did my time with 2 years in jail.

01:11:49.625 --> 01:11:51.042
We should call it even.

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:52.750
You can't even sort out the stake in front of you.

01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:53.958
Let alone a big business of that scale!

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.583
You think you know my stake better than me?
You jerk!

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:57.583
I do know you'll lose this game!

01:11:57.625 --> 01:11:58.708
I will win...

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:05.458
I'm done playing.

01:12:05.792 --> 01:12:06.792
Take it over.

01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:19.250
You're getting so upset today...
that's not your style.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500
Let us not forget this.

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:28.792
You get to play the game
if Brother Rock allows you to take part.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:32.958
If Brother Rock leaves us out of the game,
nobody gets to win.

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:39.875
Excuse me, but I won!

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.000
What timing!

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:49.875
It's the Brits' idea to divide
the business into four shares.

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:56.375
Ho,

01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.750
I hope you understand.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:02.583
The Brits are still calling the shots.

01:13:04.042 --> 01:13:06.833
Like I said... whatever you say, Brother Rock.

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:10.542
Cheers...

01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:21.667
Are you out of your mind!

01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:22.625
Fuck you!

01:13:22.667 --> 01:13:24.042
Have you gone mad?!

01:13:24.125 --> 01:13:25.167
What about my leg?

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:26.583
Brother Rock!

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:29.000
If not for Brother Rock,
I would've killed you already.

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:33.250
Fuck you... Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:44.417
Tomorrow early morning,

01:13:44.458 --> 01:13:47.000
I have to watch my son's performance
at his school.

01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:48.458
I should go now, sorry.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:49.792
Sure.

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:58.292
Brother Rock, help me!

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.542
Sit down!

01:14:00.167 --> 01:14:01.292
I'll take you to the doctor.

01:14:01.917 --> 01:14:03.417
Help me!

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:06.125
Take the ear with you! Take it!

01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:24.792
Abalone congee, Jane made it. How is it?

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:27.208
It's definitely better than what my brother makes.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.417
You bum!

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.583
I've put more than ten abalones in the congee.

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:32.208
What's taking Peter so long?

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:33.667
He's studying in his room.

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:34.750
I'll get him.

01:14:35.208 --> 01:14:37.417
Wayne, did you get that thing for me?

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.583
Yes.

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:43.208
Why did Brother Ho ask me to get a gold pen, Jane?

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:46.125
Peter's lunar birthday's coming up.

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:51.708
You stupid idiot!

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:54.208
Stupid idiot! Stupid idiot!

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:55.083
What's going on?

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.250
Do you know what he's doing?

01:14:56.875 --> 01:14:57.958
He's shooting dope!

01:14:58.375 --> 01:15:00.333
Look at him, look at the stupid idiot!

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:02.000
Look at the stupid idiot! I won't touch drugs,

01:15:02.042 --> 01:15:03.333
and I won't let my family touch drugs either!

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:04.917
Now, he's using it!

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.167
Who do you think you are?

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:07.583
You're the biggest drug dealer!

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:09.542
You sell more drugs than anyone in Hong Kong!

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:11.250
You got ten thousand people addicted!

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:13.458
Who are you to lecture me?
You're such a hypocrite!

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.542
What are you talking about?

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:16.542
You ungrateful child! What did you say?

01:15:17.292 --> 01:15:18.167
That's right, I sell drugs.

01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:19.625
If I don't do business and make money,

01:15:19.667 --> 01:15:21.083
what do I feed you? Shit?

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:23.167
People can ruin their own lives. But not you!

01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:25.958
As long as you're selling, I'll keep using!
If you quit selling, I'll quit using!

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:27.292
- What are you talking about?
- Listen to me, stop fighting.

01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:28.708
You're not my sister-in-law!

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:31.000
My sister-in-law is dead!

01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:32.125
What did you say?

01:15:32.167 --> 01:15:33.542
Don't do that, Brother Ho!

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:36.875
What did you say? Let go of me!

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.500
Don't do it, don't do it. Go! Go!

01:15:38.583 --> 01:15:40.000
You ungrateful idiot!

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:45.333
Take him to his room and watch him tight!

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:48.833
Don't let him out until he quits!

01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:53.000
Spread the word...

01:15:53.042 --> 01:15:56.000
if anybody dares to sell drugs to my brother,

01:15:56.042 --> 01:15:57.500
they will lose their arms and legs!

01:15:57.708 --> 01:16:00.917
And if I ever find out that
you guys are giving him any drugs,

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:02.792
we won't be brothers anymore!

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.000
- Understood.
- Okay.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:15.292
Calm down, okay?

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:18.208
Brother Rock, bad news.

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:19.375
What?

01:16:19.417 --> 01:16:22.333
Shit, General Jonchai in the Golden Triangle
just died of a stroke.

01:16:22.375 --> 01:16:24.167
The one taking his place is called Piyamas.

01:16:29.708 --> 01:16:30.333
Piggy-

01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:33.083
Ho! Brother Rock has been waiting for you.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:38.875
General Piyamas has just taken
over the supply for all of Asia.

01:16:39.083 --> 01:16:40.500
Brother Rock wants to make a deal
with him as soon as possible.

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:43.083
Otherwise, within three weeks
there'll be zero stock in Hong Kong.

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:48.000
I want you to make a trip to Thailand.

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:50.750
Rose will setup everything for you.

01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:53.042
I have people who can help
with negotiations with the general.

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:57.667
You're putting a lot of faith in me, Brother Rock!

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:59.458
Who else? You don't think I'd trust Chubby, do you?

01:16:59.792 --> 01:17:03.167
It's the Brits' idea to split up
the business into four shares.

01:17:03.208 --> 01:17:04.833
They don't want you to be the only dominant party.

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.542
They're afraid you'll become unmanageable.

01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:31.750
If I manage to strike a deal,

01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:33.083
I will become the only dominant party
when I return.

01:17:35.458 --> 01:17:36.417
Aren't you afraid of that?

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:39.208
Yes, I am.

01:17:40.958 --> 01:17:44.125
But I'm more afraid that Will
or Chubby might get there before you.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
Hello, hello!

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.500
Hi Brother Ho, long time no see!

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:11.500
Come in please, make yourself at home.

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:13.917
Please come in.

01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:17.958
Stop staring!

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:18.875
I know!

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:21.250
Hey, Thai dude!

01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:22.750
Making good money, huh?

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:24.958
If not for Brother Ho,

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.292
I wouldn't be here today.

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.625
Sit, my brother, sit.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:36.583
Brother Ho, the Golden Triangle has been

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:38.375
a mess since General Jonchai died.

01:18:38.417 --> 01:18:43.083
And General Piyamas is even nastier than Jonchai.

01:18:43.167 --> 01:18:45.000
He kicked out all my suppliers!
He's such a headache!

01:18:45.042 --> 01:18:49.333
I'm still finding a way to get close to him.
I need a little time.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:52.542
Will and Chubby came to see me a few days back.

01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.417
I told them to go to hell.

01:18:55.375 --> 01:18:56.958
I only do business with Brother Ho!

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.167
Let's stop talking about all this nonsense
and relax tonight.

01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:01.375
We'll talk again after the spa.

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.500
Do you know what's the most important in business?

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:16.042
Keeping your promise!

01:19:17.875 --> 01:19:19.500
How much did Will pay you to do this?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.583
You son of a bitch!

01:19:23.542 --> 01:19:24.833
You son of a bitch!

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:50.583
Come on!

01:19:53.917 --> 01:19:55.292
Come on! Come on!

01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:04.875
Get up, you son of a bitch!

01:20:08.292 --> 01:20:09.250
Crap!

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.625
Son of a bitch!

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.750
So you're well prepared to play games with me.

01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:18.875
I see you've lined up several teams to welcome me.

01:20:21.833 --> 01:20:23.875
lam Crippled Ho.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:26.667
I dare you to make a move.

01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:38.208
Go after them, kill them! Boss!

01:20:43.292 --> 01:20:44.417
Don't look.

01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:48.208
It's alright, it's alright.

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:50.333
It's alright, your brother's here.

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:56.667
It's alright.

01:20:57.958 --> 01:20:59.042
It's alright.

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:06.958
It's alright, brother's here. It's alright.

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:15.500
Brother Ho, take me home...

01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:18.250
Take me home.

01:21:18.417 --> 01:21:21.958
The Buddha will bless you! It's alright!

01:21:22.417 --> 01:21:23.333
You'll be okay.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.417
Brother.

01:21:25.458 --> 01:21:26.417
Yes.

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:29.833
Don't tell Granny.

01:21:30.208 --> 01:21:31.208
I won't.

01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:40.500
Wayne!

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:56.208
Damn it, you son of a bitch!

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.875
I'll kill you!

01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:05.625
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:10.875
Life or death, poverty or riches.
It's all destined.

01:23:01.542 --> 01:23:04.542
I can't believe that stupid cripple survived.

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:07.083
Wait until he gets to the Golden Triangle.
I want to see if he makes it out in one piece.

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:13.750
I have to thank Lee Rock for getting you

01:23:13.792 --> 01:23:15.542
to share my business in Hong Kong.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:18.583
If not for him, I don't think I'd ever have
gotten the chance to get close to you.

01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:20.542
Don't you have a wife already?

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:25.125
Why would I need her when I have you now?

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:27.000
I haven't said yes.

01:23:32.583 --> 01:23:35.333
Just treat my little brother well,

01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:39.833
and I can give you my life for it.

01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:39.542
Stay here.

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:41.333
General, they're here.

01:24:41.958 --> 01:24:44.875
How are you, General Piyamas? I am Crippled Ho!

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.250
I am so happy to see you today.

01:24:50.333 --> 01:24:52.833
I've brought some medical supplies for your troops

01:24:52.875 --> 01:24:55.292
and some premium Cuban cigars for you.

01:25:06.667 --> 01:25:08.458
Come over here, have a seat.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Please sit.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:13.958
Please sit.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.458
Brother Ho, I heard you've come a long way.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.167
You need my goods.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.500
What is your offer?

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:32.458
Super, General! Getting straight to the point.

01:25:33.833 --> 01:25:35.208
The previous General Jonchai

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:39.125
charged me $3500 for a kilo.

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:41.167
I am offering you 400 more.

01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:43.208
$3900 is my price!

01:25:44.042 --> 01:25:45.042
How about that?

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:47.708
$3900?

01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:51.125
Someone already offered me $6000 per kilo.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.458
$6000?

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.917
He has to be a moron to offer $6000.

01:25:56.958 --> 01:25:58.292
The market can't absorb that.

01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:00.042
It's impossible.

01:26:00.167 --> 01:26:03.542
Mr. Ho, it doesn't matter what you say now.

01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:09.083
He's brought over the deposit.

01:26:32.042 --> 01:26:34.417
Will, did you really offer $6000?

01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:35.792
Are you nuts?

01:26:35.833 --> 01:26:37.333
How are you going to pay the money?

01:26:38.417 --> 01:26:39.875
Idiots like him who betrayed me

01:26:39.917 --> 01:26:40.958
will betray you, too.

01:26:41.417 --> 01:26:43.208
You should never do business with people like him.

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.125
I, Crippled Ho, am a man of my words.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.125
I can guarantee you satisfaction
if you partner with me.

01:26:50.417 --> 01:26:51.708
$3900!

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.917
You dare play games with me?

01:27:04.958 --> 01:27:07.583
You stupid limp! You think this is Hong Kong?
This is Thailand!

01:27:07.625 --> 01:27:10.250
You wanna bargain with me, you can go to hell!

01:27:10.417 --> 01:27:11.417
Daddy!

01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:15.792
Some nice guys took Mommy
and me to ride the carousel!

01:27:15.917 --> 01:27:19.000
When are you coming to join us?

01:27:51.333 --> 01:27:53.125
Please... I'm begging you!

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:54.375
Sell me some dope!

01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:55.833
Get outta here!

01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:57.625
Please! Please!

01:27:57.667 --> 01:28:00.542
Let's see what the kid's up to. Get him over here.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:03.667
Your brother's spread the word

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:05.625
that whoever sells you drugs
will end up with no arms and legs.

01:28:05.667 --> 01:28:06.583
How can I sell you any?

01:28:06.625 --> 01:28:07.958
I'm dying here!

01:28:08.042 --> 01:28:10.542
Better you than me, right?

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:12.000
Please, I beg you! Please...

01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:13.000
What's his deal?

01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:14.333
He wants dope.

01:28:14.917 --> 01:28:15.875
Come with me.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.667
Thank you, thank you, bro.

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:25.583
Come over here.

01:28:26.042 --> 01:28:27.333
Brother Chubby, he's here.

01:28:27.375 --> 01:28:28.375
Brother Chubby.

01:28:29.625 --> 01:28:30.833
What do you need, little bro?

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:33.542
I need a hit.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.125
You wanna chase the dragon?

01:28:35.375 --> 01:28:37.917
That's fantastic! No problem.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.875
Hey, look at you. You need your fix?

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:45.333
Oh, look at all the drool and snot...

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:46.458
He looks more comical than

01:28:46.542 --> 01:28:49.375
Steve Martin!

01:28:52.375 --> 01:28:54.542
So, this is Limpy Ho's little brother?

01:28:54.583 --> 01:28:55.875
Let's have some fun with him.

01:28:55.917 --> 01:28:56.833
_ Fun!
- OK!

01:28:56.875 --> 01:28:57.458
Yeah.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.333
Look little bro,

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:00.833
Chubby takes brotherhood very seriously.

01:29:00.875 --> 01:29:02.542
You want dope? No problem.

01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:04.458
Brothers don't talk money.

01:29:05.292 --> 01:29:07.625
Just drink with me... It's as simple as that.

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:08.458
Thank you.

01:29:09.583 --> 01:29:10.750
OK!

01:29:10.917 --> 01:29:11.792
Fun.

01:29:12.417 --> 01:29:13.250
Fun. Huh?

01:29:14.917 --> 01:29:15.500
Let's see.

01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:18.167
Wow, you're getting it on the rocks!
A nice cold drink, buddy.

01:29:18.208 --> 01:29:19.625
See how nice he is to you!

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:23.083
Freshly squeezed orange juice!

01:29:27.042 --> 01:29:30.750
Wow! Wow! Wow!

01:29:34.458 --> 01:29:36.458
How refreshing!

01:29:44.792 --> 01:29:49.167
Oh look, it seems westerners pee more than others.

01:29:51.667 --> 01:29:54.875
Now little buddy, be a good boy and drink up...

01:29:57.083 --> 01:30:00.167
Drink it up and all of this is yours.

01:30:00.292 --> 01:30:03.417
You get to chase the dragon and get high...

01:30:04.208 --> 01:30:09.250
Drink pee! Drink pee! Drink pee!

01:30:09.292 --> 01:30:12.250
Come on, you're not gonna let us down, are you?

01:30:12.375 --> 01:30:14.917
Drink pee! Drink pee! Drink pee!

01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:17.792
Come on, come on! Be good!

01:30:17.958 --> 01:30:25.458
Drink pee! Drink pee! Drink pee!

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:31.708
Go to hell!

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:33.125
You little shit!

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:36.708
Bring him over here!

01:30:50.708 --> 01:30:51.833
You little shit!

01:30:56.583 --> 01:30:57.500
Get him away!

01:31:14.375 --> 01:31:15.208
Brother Ho.

01:31:35.417 --> 01:31:36.667
What did the doctor say?

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:40.167
The doctor said he's suffered
serious brain damage.

01:31:41.083 --> 01:31:42.875
He could become a human vegetable.

01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:44.792
And even if he wakes up,

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.750
his intelligence will be affected.

01:31:52.833 --> 01:31:54.708
I told the stupid kid not to touch that stuff...

01:31:56.125 --> 01:31:57.958
I told him not to touch that stuff!

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:08.250
I'll take care of Chubby.

01:32:08.375 --> 01:32:10.542
It's not Chubby! It's Hunter, that son of a bitch!

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:13.958
I can forget what he did to me.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.250
But for what he did to my brother,
I'll have his whole family killed!

01:32:16.333 --> 01:32:17.542
You can't kill a cop.

01:32:18.167 --> 01:32:19.750
Especially not a British cop.

01:32:19.792 --> 01:32:22.125
Don't make yourself an enemy of the Brits.
We can't win over them!

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:23.708
Who says we can't win?

01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:25.375
I control the entire drug trade in Hong Kong.

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:27.208
All the cops in Hong Kong are fed by me.

01:32:27.958 --> 01:32:28.917
I just need to say the word...

01:32:29.083 --> 01:32:30.375
and the whole police headquarters
can be burned down!

01:32:30.417 --> 01:32:32.167
Brother Ho, take it easy!

01:32:32.208 --> 01:32:34.375
Calm down! Just cool it for a while.

01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:38.792
Ok.

01:32:45.958 --> 01:32:47.917
Don't you know why this is happening?

01:32:48.958 --> 01:32:51.042
Don't you know we're not invincible?

01:32:51.792 --> 01:32:53.750
Don't you know why the Brits never bothered us

01:32:53.792 --> 01:32:55.417
for the bad things we did?

01:32:57.333 --> 01:33:00.542
That's because we always follow the rules.

01:33:04.667 --> 01:33:06.000
Don't you understand there are lines
we just don't cross?

01:33:06.042 --> 01:33:08.083
And you're about to do it!

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.167
If you kill a cop,

01:33:10.208 --> 01:33:12.167
the Brits won't let us get away with it.

01:33:12.458 --> 01:33:14.375
Then, we won't be the only ones who'll suffer.

01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:16.792
What about our brothers?

01:33:16.833 --> 01:33:18.375
What about our families?

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.625
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

01:33:20.667 --> 01:33:22.000
Do you?

01:33:22.042 --> 01:33:23.458
Why did you say that?

01:33:23.917 --> 01:33:25.208
Playing the sympathy card?

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.958
What do you mean we can't kill the Brits?

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.042
When did you become the British Queen's godson?

01:33:30.417 --> 01:33:31.542
Come here!

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.708
Look! That's my brother over there!

01:33:34.667 --> 01:33:36.125
What would you do
if the one lying there were your son?

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:38.667
I won't kill the cops.

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.833
Ho, Peter is coughing blood!

01:33:49.125 --> 01:33:50.292
Get the doctor!

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:51.667
Quick, get the doctor!

01:33:53.833 --> 01:33:55.375
Your ultimate nightmare is finally here...

01:33:56.458 --> 01:33:57.500
Let me shut the door.

01:33:57.542 --> 01:33:59.458
And now, a special news report:

01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:01.708
Hong Kong Governor Sir MacLehose has announced

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:03.833
the establishment of the ICAC,
the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

01:34:03.958 --> 01:34:06.500
The main aim of the ICAC is to combat bribery
and corruption amongst civil servants

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:08.708
and private organizations.

01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:11.250
Sir Jack Cater has been
appointed Commissioner of the ICAC.

01:34:11.375 --> 01:34:14.583
The ICAC is currently recruiting

01:34:14.875 --> 01:34:18.417
but they claim they won't recruit
from the current civil servant system.

01:34:18.458 --> 01:34:20.167
This concludes the special news report.

01:34:27.917 --> 01:34:29.708
The ICAC...

01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:32.917
it's definitely just for show.

01:34:33.542 --> 01:34:37.583
They've set up an anti-corruption unit
at the headquarters before.

01:34:37.625 --> 01:34:38.417
ICAC.

01:34:38.458 --> 01:34:39.625
And what ended up happening?

01:34:42.208 --> 01:34:44.375
We just gave them a cut!

01:34:44.417 --> 01:34:46.417
I don't think this is the same.

01:34:46.458 --> 01:34:48.042
I think they're quite serious this time.

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:52.917
I just don't believe they'll arrest
all the policemen who are taking bribes.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.750
Who's gonna maintain law and order in Hong Kong?

01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:56.208
Maybe those in the Walled City?

01:34:57.083 --> 01:34:58.417
Absolutely!

01:34:59.292 --> 01:35:01.292
I'll be flying to Spain tomorrow,

01:35:01.333 --> 01:35:03.375
I wonder if they'll catch me when I get back.

01:35:03.417 --> 01:35:06.250
The Brits... 9 out of 10 are corrupt.

01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:09.125
"Chief Superintendent Peter Godber fled
to Spain to dodge an ICAC investigation."

01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:10.750
"Public urges government to arrest Godber
and put him on trial."

01:35:10.917 --> 01:35:11.708
Have you always been

01:35:11.833 --> 01:35:13.042
Lee Rock's designated "rent-collector"?

01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:14.875
What do you mean by "rent-collector"?
I'm a landlord.

01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:17.917
You centralize all the bribes collected every month

01:35:17.958 --> 01:35:20.083
and distribute to the officers of different ranks.

01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:21.583
Come on, can you stop talking nonsense?

01:35:21.625 --> 01:35:23.167
I have no idea what you're talking about!

01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:28.708
Sergeant Major Ngan,
you have 16 bank accounts in Hong Kong

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:30.875
with a total of $98,000,000 savings.

01:35:30.917 --> 01:35:33.792
And also <i>22</i> apartments 
and <i>7</i> brand name cars,

01:35:33.833 --> 01:35:36.125
including a Rolls Royce, plus 2 restaurants...
all under your name.

01:35:36.167 --> 01:35:39.083
And yet your salary is $3200 a month.
Can you explain that?

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:41.000
I love to gamble.

01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:43.458
And I sure have a lot of luck.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:44.667
I win every single time.

01:35:46.042 --> 01:35:49.042
They call me the god of gamblers.

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:04.542
This morning, some guys

01:36:04.583 --> 01:36:07.583
claimed they were from the ICAC,

01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.625
and asked Daddy to help them
with an investigation.

01:36:09.875 --> 01:36:11.167
Daddy was very upset...

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:13.292
and had a heart attack.

01:36:14.458 --> 01:36:15.500
Dad!

01:36:24.667 --> 01:36:28.708
The ICAC is not just for show.

01:36:30.667 --> 01:36:32.958
They had the guts to mess with me...

01:36:34.083 --> 01:36:35.167
Rock,

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.333
run away...

01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:41.333
take Cheryl and the kids and run.

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:46.083
You may not make it out
if you stay here any longer. Okay?

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:15.583
It's a bit late for a visit, Brother Rock.

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:16.708
I know.

01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:20.750
Well, I wanted to let you know...
I put in my notice.

01:37:21.542 --> 01:37:22.875
I'm going to Canada tomorrow.

01:37:23.708 --> 01:37:25.083
Have a safe flight.

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:27.083
Let's leave together.

01:37:29.833 --> 01:37:31.542
Even if you don't care,

01:37:31.583 --> 01:37:34.750
you should think about Jane and the two kids.

01:37:37.083 --> 01:37:39.708
You came here at this hour just to tell me that?

01:37:45.458 --> 01:37:46.833
I know you're upset.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:48.875
Please sit.

01:37:48.917 --> 01:37:49.792
No need.

01:37:49.833 --> 01:37:52.708
I know you're upset about what I've been
doing these past two months.

01:37:53.042 --> 01:37:55.250
You wanted to bomb his car,
and I got my guys to stop him.

01:37:56.125 --> 01:37:57.417
You tried to ambush him at the police station,

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:58.792
and I got my guys to take him away.

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:01.250
Do you have any idea why?

01:38:02.958 --> 01:38:05.583
If a British cop dies, both you and I are screwed.

01:38:06.458 --> 01:38:07.708
Do you understand?

01:38:16.083 --> 01:38:19.375
I got a tip that the ICAC will be coming

01:38:19.417 --> 01:38:21.000
to get me in 2 weeks' time.

01:38:21.625 --> 01:38:23.667
And by that time, Ngan will take my place.

01:38:24.917 --> 01:38:25.958
With me out of the picture,

01:38:28.125 --> 01:38:29.542
nobody can take care of you.

01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:32.375
You have to understand...

01:38:33.167 --> 01:38:34.375
this is for your own good.

01:38:38.625 --> 01:38:39.792
For my own good?

01:38:46.417 --> 01:38:48.083
I'm a cripple. See?

01:38:49.583 --> 01:38:50.917
This is because of you.

01:38:51.083 --> 01:38:52.208
We are brothers... You can't look at it like this...

01:38:55.375 --> 01:38:56.167
I've already given a lot--

01:38:56.208 --> 01:38:58.958
Don't you forget,
it was you who sent me to Thailand

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.792
and got my brother, Wayne, killed.

01:39:01.833 --> 01:39:04.167
And my real brother is now lying in the hospital.

01:39:04.292 --> 01:39:05.458
He's a vegetable!

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.250
I never expected all this to happen.

01:39:08.167 --> 01:39:11.292
I'm not God... I can't control everything!

01:39:11.333 --> 01:39:12.458
That's right!

01:39:12.583 --> 01:39:14.042
You can't control everything!

01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:16.958
We can't control life, and we can't control death.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.625
But between life and death,

01:39:19.167 --> 01:39:21.292
I get to choose my own path.

01:39:21.375 --> 01:39:22.250
lam in control.

01:39:22.292 --> 01:39:23.333
All this lecture...

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.542
So you saved my life and ruined your own.

01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:26.792
That's what you're trying to say, right?

01:39:31.042 --> 01:39:33.125
Ok, this is my life right here, take it!

01:39:33.708 --> 01:39:35.542
Shoot me. It's ok.

01:39:38.083 --> 01:39:39.042
Come on!

01:39:40.208 --> 01:39:41.167
Ok.

01:39:45.125 --> 01:39:47.458
If you were good to me,

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.792
you wouldn't plant a mole by my side.

01:39:50.667 --> 01:39:52.458
Rose, put the gun down

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.500
and tell Brother Rock your name.

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:00.875
My name is Alva.

01:40:07.958 --> 01:40:11.083
She is Alva. I raised her.

01:40:11.167 --> 01:40:13.375
I sent her to Thailand and Taiwan
to learn the skills she needed,

01:40:13.417 --> 01:40:14.708
and I put her beside you.

01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:16.542
And I know that you, Sergeant Major Lee,

01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:19.500
wouldn't pass up a skilled player like her.

01:40:21.917 --> 01:40:22.958
Bravo!

01:40:24.125 --> 01:40:26.000
You've transformed the little girl

01:40:27.292 --> 01:40:31.167
who was abused by her dad
in Kowloon City into today's Rose.

01:40:32.625 --> 01:40:34.375
And you think I didn't know?

01:40:35.792 --> 01:40:38.458
You thought I was blind?

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:41.375
You planted a mole beside me!

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.792
Do you have any respect for me at all?

01:40:44.833 --> 01:40:47.250
What about respect for me?

01:40:47.292 --> 01:40:49.375
If I hadn't put Rose beside you,
I would've been dead long time ago!

01:40:49.417 --> 01:40:51.208
- You--
- Ho...

01:40:52.417 --> 01:40:53.583
Jane.

01:40:53.625 --> 01:40:56.417
The kids refuse to sleep.
They want you to be with them.

01:40:57.958 --> 01:41:00.000
Ok. I think we're almost done here.

01:41:00.292 --> 01:41:01.333
We're done, right?

01:41:04.875 --> 01:41:06.875
You made me very angry tonight.

01:41:06.958 --> 01:41:08.667
Alva, walk Brother Rock out.

01:41:08.708 --> 01:41:09.708
No.

01:41:11.583 --> 01:41:13.958
For once I want to see what it's like not
to have a mole beside me.

01:41:17.250 --> 01:41:18.333
Watch over them.

01:41:29.458 --> 01:41:31.958
Give me some aspirin.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.583
Be careful.

01:41:49.083 --> 01:41:51.083
Hey, I thought we were meeting at the airport?

01:41:52.625 --> 01:41:55.250
Bad news, Ho is going to kill Hunter tonight.

01:41:58.625 --> 01:41:59.667
Honey?

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:13.458
Get Jan to help at once.

01:42:17.125 --> 01:42:20.042
This is the evidence
for Hunter's corrupt activities.

01:42:21.167 --> 01:42:23.000
Ask Jan to give it to the ICAC.

01:42:23.583 --> 01:42:24.708
Roger that.

01:42:25.583 --> 01:42:28.333
Is that all, Brother Rock?

01:42:28.958 --> 01:42:30.667
Do you have anything else for me to do?

01:43:49.417 --> 01:43:52.583
Well I didn't know that sort of thing
was even legal over here.

01:43:52.667 --> 01:43:55.125
Listen, I've arrested people for less...

01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:57.083
...than what we did in there to survive.

01:43:57.125 --> 01:43:58.583
I'll arrest you for less than

01:43:58.625 --> 01:43:59.917
what we did in there.

01:44:00.125 --> 01:44:00.708
Alright.

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:02.417
Peter you call it, where are we going?

01:44:02.458 --> 01:44:04.125
I wanna go to The Fifty!

01:44:04.917 --> 01:44:06.875
Hey, Jeff! Drive carefully,

01:44:06.958 --> 01:44:08.917
otherwise I might have to arrest you!

01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:11.417
You'd have a hard time trying to arrest me.

01:44:11.458 --> 01:44:13.167
Yeah, don't you worry about that.

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.917
Hey, what the fuck is going on with these cars?

01:44:16.958 --> 01:44:17.875
What?

01:44:17.958 --> 01:44:19.125
What's that?

01:44:19.625 --> 01:44:20.958
What's happening?

01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:22.292
Start the fucking car.

01:44:22.333 --> 01:44:23.375
Yeah, go, go, go!

01:44:23.417 --> 01:44:25.083
Start the fucking car!

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.042
Go!

01:44:30.708 --> 01:44:32.375
I'll kill you! You put us down!

01:44:32.417 --> 01:44:34.292
I'll kill you! I'll tear your head off!

01:44:34.583 --> 01:44:36.583
Put us down right now!

01:44:36.625 --> 01:44:37.667
Ho!

01:44:38.625 --> 01:44:39.875
Where the fuck are guns?

01:44:40.292 --> 01:44:41.000
What?

01:44:41.542 --> 01:44:42.417
They're in the bloody trunk!

01:44:42.458 --> 01:44:43.292
The trunk?!

01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:45.042
Ho, put us down!

01:44:45.083 --> 01:44:46.417
You stupid gweilos!

01:44:46.458 --> 01:44:48.958
You're greedy for whatever you can lay
your hands on and rob us.

01:44:49.333 --> 01:44:50.625
You think you own Hong Kong?

01:44:50.708 --> 01:44:51.833
It's ours!

01:44:55.083 --> 01:44:56.167
As soon as I get outta here

01:44:56.208 --> 01:44:57.667
you're a dead man!

01:44:58.708 --> 01:45:00.333
You think you're gonna be able to
get away with this?

01:45:00.458 --> 01:45:02.833
Open the door! Open the door!

01:45:02.917 --> 01:45:04.625
You put us down right now, or I'll...

01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:21.125
No way! No, no, no!

01:45:29.375 --> 01:45:31.208
Jeff, the door. Move it!

01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:32.167
Wake up!

01:45:32.208 --> 01:45:33.625
Wake the fuck up, guys!

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.250
Get the fuck outta here!

01:45:35.292 --> 01:45:37.333
The door is jammed. It's jammed in!

01:45:43.125 --> 01:45:44.208
Jesus!

01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:47.833
It's payback time, Hunter!

01:46:16.667 --> 01:46:18.125
Tong, give me a fucking gun!

01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:27.958
Get in the car!

01:46:36.625 --> 01:46:38.167
Chad... a gun!

01:46:55.792 --> 01:46:56.750
Is everything alright?

01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:02.250
You son of a bitch!

01:47:02.458 --> 01:47:03.458
Watch it!

01:47:26.625 --> 01:47:28.042
Go to hell, you bastard!

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:02.750
What's your name?

01:48:02.792 --> 01:48:04.208
My name is Alva.

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.583
This way!

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Halt!

01:48:57.333 --> 01:49:00.333
Call the riot police.
I want this whole place locked down!

01:49:00.458 --> 01:49:01.583
Yes, sir!

01:49:23.458 --> 01:49:24.833
You're the only brother I have left.

01:49:24.917 --> 01:49:26.417
Run! Go as far as you can!

01:49:45.458 --> 01:49:46.417
Why aren't you moving?

01:49:46.958 --> 01:49:48.167
I told you to run!

01:49:48.583 --> 01:49:50.292
Are you not obeying my orders anymore?

01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:51.958
You think I won't shoot you right here?

01:49:53.292 --> 01:49:54.250
You son of a bitch!

01:50:06.083 --> 01:50:07.417
Are you gonna kill me?

01:50:07.542 --> 01:50:08.542
Why are you running?

01:50:09.375 --> 01:50:10.458
Stop running!

01:50:11.458 --> 01:50:13.250
Why are you running so fast?

01:50:14.833 --> 01:50:17.000
You son of a bitch!

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:27.833
Open the door! Open the door!

01:51:09.833 --> 01:51:11.250
I have an arrest warrant for a guy

01:51:11.292 --> 01:51:13.375
in the Walled City called Crippled Ho.

01:51:13.458 --> 01:51:15.042
A special mission is in action in there.

01:51:15.083 --> 01:51:16.333
No one can be admitted.

01:51:16.708 --> 01:51:18.083
Says who?

01:51:21.208 --> 01:51:22.958
I'm asking you: says who?

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.417
Chief Detective Ngan Tung.

01:51:24.458 --> 01:51:25.708
That's starting tomorrow.

01:51:26.375 --> 01:51:28.917
Before 12 o'clock midnight,
I am still the Chief Detective.

01:51:29.833 --> 01:51:31.500
Not even Hunter can stop me.

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:32.833
Move it!

01:51:34.417 --> 01:51:35.750
Move it!

01:52:38.125 --> 01:52:39.333
Shit!

01:52:40.042 --> 01:52:41.417
Dammit...

01:52:46.292 --> 01:52:50.625
Brother Rock, Brother Rock...

01:52:51.708 --> 01:52:53.542
save a position for me...

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:56.667
I want to work for you again in my next life.

01:52:57.958 --> 01:52:59.458
Brother Rock...

01:53:58.708 --> 01:54:00.042
BYE, Ho!

01:54:16.458 --> 01:54:18.125
Where did you come from?

01:54:19.083 --> 01:54:20.792
Where did you go?

01:54:21.917 --> 01:54:24.250
Heigh Ho...!

01:54:24.292 --> 01:54:27.042
Fuck you!

01:55:20.625 --> 01:55:21.958
Drop the gun!

01:55:52.667 --> 01:55:53.833
Ho,

01:55:54.458 --> 01:55:55.958
let's walk out together.

01:56:15.708 --> 01:56:18.417
Don't! Ho!

01:56:21.250 --> 01:56:22.292
Ho!

01:56:28.708 --> 01:56:30.208
Ho!

01:57:07.833 --> 01:57:10.250
Fuck you!

01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:12.000
Fuck you!

01:57:14.917 --> 01:57:16.208
You can't kill me!

01:57:17.167 --> 01:57:19.250
I'm a British police officer!

01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:23.417
If you do, it'll make me a fucking hero.

01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:25.583
You fucking fisherman.

01:57:26.292 --> 01:57:29.167
My nation, we built this place!

01:57:29.208 --> 01:57:31.958
We civilized the lot of you, fuckers!

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.292
Without us, you'd still be a fucking fisherman!

01:57:42.292 --> 01:57:43.417
Ho!

01:57:44.542 --> 01:57:46.833
Life and death are destined.

01:57:51.958 --> 01:57:53.042
Ho!

01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:54.417
Don't make me do it!

01:57:58.667 --> 01:58:00.208
All our brothers

01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:02.792
and sisters have died for us.

01:58:04.042 --> 01:58:07.875
Pulling that trigger now
is not going to get them back.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.125
Please give yourself a chance.

01:58:13.083 --> 01:58:14.792
Give your kids a chance.

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.417
Give Jane a chance.

01:58:43.667 --> 01:58:45.292
You're a good brother.

02:00:04.917 --> 02:00:07.375
In 1974, Crippled Ho was arrested for drug
trafficking and sentenced to 30 years in jail.

02:00:07.375 --> 02:00:09.833
Lee Rock fled overseas
and never stepped foot in Hong Kong again.

02:00:09.833 --> 02:00:12.292
The highest ranking runaway criminal,
Peter Godber,

02:00:12.292 --> 02:00:14.750
was extradited from Spain to Hong Kong
and put on trial.

02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:17.208
The corrupt empire which had been
protected by the entire colonial system vanished,

02:00:17.208 --> 02:00:18.792
and the era of corruption in Hong Kong ended.

02:02:02.875 --> 02:02:05.167
Ng Sai Ho, also known as Crippled Ho,

02:02:05.208 --> 02:02:07.500
who was previously sentenced
to 30 years' imprisonment...

02:02:07.542 --> 02:02:11.167
...has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer
and is getting an early release.

02:02:25.875 --> 02:02:26.792
Dad,

02:02:28.042 --> 02:02:29.000
you have a call.

02:02:33.083 --> 02:02:34.458
Is this Ho?

02:02:35.250 --> 02:02:36.458
It's Lee Rock.

02:02:36.542 --> 02:02:37.500
Oh, Brother Rock.

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.417
How are you?

02:02:41.375 --> 02:02:42.417
Quite good.

02:02:44.042 --> 02:02:48.583
Would you consider coming here to visit?

02:02:49.625 --> 02:02:51.083
The environment isn't bad.

02:02:53.208 --> 02:02:56.667
If I wanted to leave, I would've left back then.

02:02:57.125 --> 02:02:58.625
I like Hong Kong.

02:03:03.292 --> 02:03:05.458
If I had another chance to do it over,

02:03:07.792 --> 02:03:10.292
which path do you think I would take?

02:03:12.708 --> 02:03:16.292
Heroes are created in critical times.

02:03:17.375 --> 02:03:19.917
There has to be a hero or two.

02:03:20.292 --> 02:03:21.250
Right?

02:03:22.167 --> 02:03:24.458
Right, right.

02:03:28.792 --> 02:03:30.583
Hey, don't smoke too much, okay?

02:03:31.375 --> 02:03:33.000
Take care of yourself.

02:03:36.125 --> 02:03:39.917
Life or death, riches or poverty.
It's all destined.

02:03:43.667 --> 02:03:49.250
Life or death, riches or poverty.
It's all destined.

02:03:53.417 --> 02:03:54.708
I really want to see you again.

02:03:56.167 --> 02:03:59.250
If you have the chance... do pay me a visit.

02:04:23.333 --> 02:04:25.000
Quick, Alva!

02:04:39.708 --> 02:04:40.875
Hey, bro!

02:04:44.875 --> 02:04:45.833
Brother Ho!

02:04:45.875 --> 02:04:47.000
Brother Ho!

02:04:51.375 --> 02:04:53.833
Life or death, riches or poverty...

02:04:53.917 --> 02:04:56.167
I've been a drug dealer all my life.

02:04:56.208 --> 02:05:03.000
I can take nothing with me now
except the sins I've been carrying.

02:05:11.917 --> 02:05:15.208
"Two weeks after he was released from prison,
Crippled Ho died of liver cancer."
