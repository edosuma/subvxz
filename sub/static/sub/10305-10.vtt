00:03.480 --> 00:05.789
You know I'm not one
to beat around the bush.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.830
Unless, of course, you're in it.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.073
So I'll make this fast.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.834
Like you know any other way.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.111
I'm planning a get-together for the guys
and you're going to help me.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.596
Oh, God, Al.
Didn't I just get all dressed up...

00:21.800 --> 00:24.872
...so I could go to some tired party
and impress your friends?

00:25.120 --> 00:27.918
That was the senior prom, Peg.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.633
And you were only in your dress
for 20 minutes.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.434
Now, there's a big wrestling show
on cable Saturday night.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.636
- Is it pay-per-view?
- No.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.592
It is now.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.913
Oh, come on, Peg. You want me
to look stupid in front of my friends?

00:43.120 --> 00:48.478
The same friends who use Silly Putty
to give Nancy and Sluggo hooters?

00:49.720 --> 00:52.712
Well, at least those hooters
are fun to play with.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.830
Look, Al, it's not like I don't want
to help you, but I'm very busy.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.917
You think I just sit here all day long?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.917
No, no, Peg. No.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.671
From the potholes in the couch,
I'd say you sit here, and you sit here.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.158
I don't sit there,
that's where I put my food.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

01:50.280 --> 01:52.919
Caramel corn on the cob.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.594
Needs more butter.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.678
<i>Today on Oprah,
a clean house is a safe house.</i>

02:00.880 --> 02:01.949
Yeah, right.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.118
I'm home.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.551
Oh, Peg, don't- Don't get up.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.758
What's that? A beer? Sounds good.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.555
No, let me get it.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.195
Way to home-make, Peg.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.877
What am I complaining about?
There's food and her mouth is shut.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.514
For future reference,
the next time a producer asks you...

03:05.720 --> 03:09.429
...what your method is,
please don't say the sponge.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.878
Well, at least my form of birth control
isn't Miss Piggy sheets.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.116
- I do not use Miss Piggy sheets.
- Yes, you do.

03:17.360 --> 03:22.559
Kids, kids. Keep it down. Keep it down.
Your mother needs her rest.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.956
The house is a mess,
and the family's starving.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.355
Her work here is done.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.195
Dad, Mom doesn't look so good.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.274
You should see her
without her mask.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.750
<i>Look at this TV Guide. The last
chocolate stain was at 3:00 today.</i>

03:41.200 --> 03:43.555
She's obviously been
unconscious for hours.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.713
Hey, and look. There's a dent
on the coffee table like-

03:47.920 --> 03:51.310
Like it's been hit
by a big, hard hairdo.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.190
Listen, Nancy Drool
and Hardly Boy...

03:56.840 --> 03:59.070
...it's impossible for your mother
to have fallen.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.319
That would mean that at some point,
she would have to have been standing.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.637
Mom stands. I saw her the other day.

04:08.440 --> 04:12.433
That was just to shake
the crumbs out of her cleavage.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.755
Dad, look, a bonbon stain.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.355
Mom must have slipped on one.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.479
I got it.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.914
Nice try, punk.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.915
Hey, Mom needs one of those guys.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.999
The ones that make you take your
clothes off when you go to their office.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.038
Principal?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.835
Your mother doesn't need a doctor.
She's breathing. She's fine.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.629
Now relax
and let Daddy enjoy his weekend.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.470
Oh, my God.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.953
Damn.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.676
Am I in hell?

05:05.600 --> 05:07.750
No, if you were in hell,
you'd be on a throne...

05:07.960 --> 05:10.190
...and the devil would be packing.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.879
Who are you people?
I don't recognise you at all.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.715
Well, in that case,
thanks for stopping by. See you soon.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.999
Hey, I don't even know who I am.
I don't know anything.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.270
Only thing you have to know
is Route 55...

05:32.480 --> 05:34.391
...is the quickest way out of town.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.356
Oh, my God. Mom has Indonesia.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.950
Now, now, Kelly,
don't bother the nice lady.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.673
She's just on her way out.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.917
- Where am I going?
- You're going to see your family.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.680
They must miss you.
You seem like a very nice person.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.793
- Have a nice life.
- Oh, no. Now Dad's got it.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.395
No, no. We are your family.

05:57.640 --> 06:00.108
See, I'm your daughter, Kelly...

06:00.320 --> 06:04.996
...and this is your son, Quasimodo.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.590
Speaking of humps...

06:10.600 --> 06:13.194
...why don't we tell Mommy
your nickname?

06:13.400 --> 06:14.833
The Little Fur Maid.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.311
You know,
I don't remember any of you.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.512
But if you say you're my family,
I guess it's true.

06:23.760 --> 06:28.231
Why would we lie about something
the courts have ruled on repeatedly?

06:28.960 --> 06:30.393
Feeling better, Mom?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.672
Well, Quasi, my head kind of hurts...

06:34.440 --> 06:36.476
...and I'm starving.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.795
Aren't you guys hungry?

06:38.040 --> 06:40.235
You know we're hungry.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.637
Well, why don't I make
some dinner then?

06:47.280 --> 06:51.068
Mom's cooking?
I'm going to call the doctor.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.840
Touch that phone, I'll kill you.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.838
Kids, now that
we've retrained Mommy...

06:57.040 --> 06:59.952
...I've come up with a schedule
to maximise her productivity.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.799
There are three of us.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.231
Mommy can only work
24 hours a day.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.913
Why?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.750
There are two of us.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.071
So let's divide this up evenly.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.636
I get Mommy for 23 hours.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.668
You get her for one.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.516
Well, that's not fair.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.109
I- I love Mommy more.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.114
No, I love Mommy more.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.909
But I'm the only one
who had to love Mommy.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.956
There's not even time
for Mom to go to bed.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.799
Now you see
the brilliance of my schedule.

07:45.440 --> 07:49.638
Hey, you guys have got to see how
clean Mom got the bathroom upstairs.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.991
Did you know
that there's a window above the sink?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.948
Kell, there's-
There's no window in the bathroom.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.639
Yes, there is.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.592
It looks into the house next door.

08:01.800 --> 08:06.555
You know, there's this girl there
who looks exactly like me.

08:10.640 --> 08:14.189
Every time I look over there,
she's always staring at me.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.876
Maybe she's a lesbian.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.716
Maybe she's an idiot.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.914
She does kind of have
this really stupid look on her face.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.269
Come on. I'll show you.
I hope she's home. Come on.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.828
Hi, Al. I got all the stuff
for your wrestling party.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.918
Oh, except those
special french fries that you love.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.237
I thought I'd just crinkle-cut them
myself. Is that okay?

08:49.440 --> 08:53.399
Well, I'll let it slide, Peg,
since you're still recovering.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.949
You know, I am a little tired.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.391
Are you sure that I don't
sleep at all?

09:00.280 --> 09:02.874
- Ever?
- It's odd, isn't it?

09:08.320 --> 09:09.435
Well...

09:09.640 --> 09:12.950
...there's just so much to relearn.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.116
Let's see, I think I've got it though.
I love housekeeping.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.675
I hate shopping,
except for groceries...

09:19.920 --> 09:24.038
<i>...and I can't stand
that stupid Oprah Winfrey Show.</i>

09:25.280 --> 09:29.114
<i>Very good, honey.
Now, there's just one more thing.</i>

09:29.320 --> 09:31.072
You hate sex.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.914
Don't want it. Have no use for it.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.431
I know it's tragic, but I've learned
to live with it many years ago.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.520
That's why you have to go
to the Jiggly Room.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.193
That's it.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.992
- To spare you.
- Al, you are such a good husband.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.875
<i>You have been so patient with me.
And I got you a copy of Big 'Uns.</i>

09:51.080 --> 09:55.039
I cut out all the articles,
so they won't slow you down.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.352
Oh, baby, you're the greatest.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.635
How does she get them
so crinkolicious?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.794
I could really learn
to love that woman.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.398
Hey, Daddy.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.751
You- You might not remember this...

10:31.960 --> 10:34.997
...but before your accident...

10:35.200 --> 10:38.078
...you had promised me a new car.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.717
Pumpkin,
you might not remember this...

10:42.920 --> 10:47.550
...but Mommy is the vegetable
in the family.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.152
Oh, right.

10:55.760 --> 10:56.988
Well, the other one.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.117
Pumpkin, can you see
who's at that door?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.152
No.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.790
Maybe I need glasses.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.477
Okay, Al.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.518
I'm here.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.957
Hey, hey, hey, do I smell...

11:32.160 --> 11:33.354
...food?

11:34.240 --> 11:36.708
Jefferson, my man,
I got more food stuck in my teeth...

11:36.920 --> 11:39.798
...than my colon's seen
in many a year.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.956
Thanks for sharing that, Al.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.515
Oh, I'm not sharing it.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.471
You- You seem happy, Al.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.473
It's a miracle, buddy. Behold.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.636
Oh, Peg.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.117
Excuse me,
while I just rinse out these gloves.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.437
You know, considering
what a good housekeeper I am...

12:01.640 --> 12:04.791
...that shower drain was just filthy.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.797
There's a drain?

12:09.560 --> 12:10.515
What's going on?

12:10.720 --> 12:14.508
Head injury, amnesia, reprogramming,
crinkle fries. Don't tell Marcy.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.550
Oh, Peg, this is our
next-door neighbour, Jefferson.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.951
Oh, the free-loading gigolo.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.159
Would you like to try some bologna
I made from scratch?

12:25.360 --> 12:30.593
It's part of the cavalcade of cold cuts
I'll be serving at Al's wrestling party.

12:32.040 --> 12:36.272
Hey, is that radish carved
in the shape of Hulk Hogan?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.955
Well, nothing's too good for my Al.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.919
Speaking of that, I'm about to do
another load of underwear.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.554
Did you give me all your yellows?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.950
Sure did, honey.

12:52.120 --> 12:55.635
Hey, where do I have to hit Marcy
to make her like that?

12:57.120 --> 12:59.759
Just hit her a new place every day.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.672
Jefferson...

13:07.840 --> 13:11.037
...you worthless cabana boy.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.754
I told you six times to wash
the Mercedes and it's still filthy.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.596
Is that pine freshness?

13:20.760 --> 13:23.274
Hey, my shoes aren't sticking.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.589
What's going on?

13:24.840 --> 13:27.400
- Is someone else here?
- No, not really, Peg.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.878
I was just- Just tipping the paperboy.
Thank you, sonny.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.357
Now, don't be rude, Al.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.996
Perhaps the paperboy would like
some homemade peach cobbler.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.229
Okay.

13:43.440 --> 13:48.116
I know I'm not in a parallel universe
because Jefferson would be working...

13:48.320 --> 13:51.517
...and Al's fly would be zipped.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.751
So, what the hell is going on?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.194
Oh, well, it's very simple.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.834
I bumped my head,
and now my loving husband Al...

13:58.040 --> 14:01.476
...is helping me to regain
my former personality.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.668
- Really?
- Here we go.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.678
Al, you monster.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.117
Look, I can't let this happen.
There's something you have to know.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.232
Yes, there is. I forgot to tell you
that among other things...

14:13.440 --> 14:17.638
...you love to wash and detail cars,
especially Mercedes.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.513
Right, Marcy?

14:25.160 --> 14:26.991
Right.

14:32.600 --> 14:37.230
Oh, Peggy, you don't have to do that.
Chamois lint.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.793
Sorry. Oh, and I'm sorry
I didn't finish re-glazing your bathtub.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.672
I'll do it when you're sleeping.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.190
Do you sleep?
Because Al says good women don't.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.596
Oh, I can't stand this another minute.
Look, Peggy...

14:51.800 --> 14:53.597
...Al has brainwashed you.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.593
You are not cheerful, tidy
and hard-working.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.314
You are rude, mean and sloppy.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.679
You're a horrible wife, a worse mother,
and proud of it.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.798
I beg your pardon?

15:07.040 --> 15:10.077
Peggy. And I say this with love.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.273
You're the laziest bitch in Chicago.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.237
And you are a bitter woman,
Marcy D'Arcy.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.034
You see my loving,
picture-perfect family...

15:27.240 --> 15:29.959
...and suddenly, your pretty boy
husband and foreign car...

15:30.200 --> 15:32.316
...don't seem so spiffy, do they?

15:32.520 --> 15:36.752
Well, your jealous lies aren't going
to get to Mrs. Al Bundy. Good day.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.234
Peggy, wait.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.672
And for future reference,
my Al prefers his paper on the porch...

15:45.920 --> 15:48.070
...not in the bushes.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.752
Remember that,
or we'll tell your supervisor.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.959
Hey, nice job peeling these grapes,
Peg.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.878
Al, I have been lied to
and manipulated.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.113
I can explain, Peg.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.191
I can't believe what Marcy just said.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.789
How can anybody
be so vicious and cruel?

16:12.040 --> 16:15.316
She lies, Peg. She lies.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.869
I know, Al. She's trying to tear apart
our happy family.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.117
You know, I think she wants you.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.398
She has been stalking me, Peg.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.036
You may have to kill her.
There's a chain saw in the garage.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.032
Oh, Al, I'm so mad.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.949
I'm just so mad I could bake.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.917
May I suggest...

16:42.160 --> 16:44.151
...pudding in a cloud?

16:45.440 --> 16:49.115
Eat up, boys. The little woman's
bringing plenty more.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.073
So you finally dumped Peg, huh?

16:52.760 --> 16:56.150
Better. I tamed the shrew.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.634
Welcome, everyone.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.638
What's wrong?

17:05.880 --> 17:07.711
Do I need to freshen
the weenie tots?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.758
Oh, no, no, no.
Everything's great, honey.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.230
Yeah. It sure is, Peg.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.352
Say, how did you get
these margaritas so frothy?

17:16.599 --> 17:20.752
Well, I have this battery-operated
cocktail stirrer.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.635
I found it in my nightstand.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.115
Here we go.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.714
Wow, look what happened to Marcy.

17:42.960 --> 17:47.670
I don't know what you guys are doing,
but please come do it to my wife.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.991
This isn't Marcy. This is Sally.
She's going to be our ring girl.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.708
What is going on here?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.309
Al, I hate to accuse you of this...

17:58.520 --> 18:02.479
...but did you sleep with Peggy?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.597
Are you crazy? That would violate
our first commandment.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.190
Thou shall never covet thy own wife.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.440
Oh, hey, hey,
the undercard's starting, everybody.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.870
Here we go. Oh, yes, yes.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.318
I think you better rearrange those.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.229
- How's that?
- Oh, better. Much, much better.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.958
Oh, Al.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.392
- She's every man's fantasy, huh?
- She sure is.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.078
Hey, Peg.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.913
- What are you doing?
- Greasing my muffin tins.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.509
Hey, can I grease a couple?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.119
Thanks, honey. But, you know...

18:53.360 --> 18:56.432
...you have to spread them just right
or they won't rise.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.996
Well, that's not going to be
a problem.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.559
Come on, Al.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.151
Fat Snoopy Schwartz just bit the nobs
off the human trash compactor.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.076
Boy, you sure know your way
around a rolling pin.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.918
Oh, it's easy, Al.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.951
You just grab it with both hands...

19:16.160 --> 19:21.109
...and go back and forth,
back and forth.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.676
Peg. You're driving me crazy.
Let's go upstairs.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.230
Oh, Al, you're terrible.
We're hosting a party.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.671
Besides, you told me
that I don't like sex.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.632
I'll make it quick.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.989
Wow, you just got out of prison?

19:43.080 --> 19:47.312
That means you haven't had sex
for a long time.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.838
Nothing that I care to discuss.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.958
- Oh, Al.
- Oh, yes.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.989
Oh, yuck.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.398
- Oh, Al.
- Oh, yes.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.473
Oh, Al.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.433
Oh, Al.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.676
Don't move.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.677
She's back. Grab your weenie tots
and run for your lives.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.119
I'm gonna kill you.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.873
How could you brainwash me?

20:29.080 --> 20:33.631
I can't believe I've actually cooked,
and cleaned, and crinkled.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.400
Al Bundy, I feel so violated.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.600
Al- Al Bundy? Is that my name?

20:41.560 --> 20:42.675
Who are you?

20:42.880 --> 20:44.950
Gosh, you're a pretty woman.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.635
Nice try, Al.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.912
There is only one punishment
severe enough for you.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.799
No smiley face
on my omelette tomorrow?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.390
No omelette, just toast?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.438
No toast at all?

20:57.640 --> 20:58.789
Upstairs.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.036
Why, Peg, why?

21:01.240 --> 21:04.596
- There's no- There's no food upstairs.
- Oh, don't worry, Al.

21:04.800 --> 21:07.598
When I'm done with you,
you won't have any appetite at all.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.631
I know.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.513
<i>Don't go away. We'll be right back.</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:24.755
Hey, Bud,
I'd like you to meet the girl next door.
