00:01.223 --> 00:02.637
Previously on "The Night Shift"...

00:02.661 --> 00:04.773
I'm pregnant.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.489
A promotion? That's even better!

00:06.513 --> 00:07.545
No, I-it isn't.

00:07.569 --> 00:09.013
I wouldn't work in Texas anymore.

00:09.037 --> 00:10.721
I'd have to move to South Carolina.

00:10.745 --> 00:12.857
Topher: Did you hear? There's
a sniper in San Antonio.

00:12.881 --> 00:14.224
We just got to get the hell out of here.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.667
All the flights are
grounded 'cause of the storm.

00:15.691 --> 00:17.457
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'm gonna call Jordan.

00:17.481 --> 00:19.586
Jordan! I need some help in here!

00:19.609 --> 00:21.991
Help!

00:22.419 --> 00:24.179
Reporter: San Antonio has been under siege

00:24.203 --> 00:25.550
for the past 48 hours.

00:25.574 --> 00:27.572
The death toll stands at eight.

00:27.596 --> 00:30.188
Police believe they have
the sniper surrounded.

00:30.212 --> 00:32.218
In the North Site Parking structure.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.178
- It took some balls for you to come back out here.
- Let's go!

00:35.840 --> 00:38.351
You know what they say. Got to
get right back on the horse, right?

00:38.375 --> 00:40.812
Yeah, whoever said that's
probably never been shot at.

00:40.836 --> 00:43.300
Nothing wrong with being scared.

00:43.328 --> 00:44.832
Just proves you're normal.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.496
Oh, I'm scared.

00:46.497 --> 00:48.448
But I was more scared if
I didn't come out tonight,

00:48.449 --> 00:50.496
that I never would again, you know?

00:50.520 --> 00:52.789
I felt that every day in Iraq.

00:56.329 --> 00:59.624
Hey, Kenny, I just checked
on Jordan. Still the same.

00:59.648 --> 01:01.311
Any word on Gwen and Drew on the site?

01:01.312 --> 01:02.817
No, everybody's on radio silence.

01:03.423 --> 01:05.343
Just trying to get a
glimpse from the news report.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.031
T.C.: Kenny, Kenny! Where is Jordan?

01:07.055 --> 01:08.861
Up in ICU. Go, go! I got this.

01:08.885 --> 01:10.954
- Scott's up there with her. Let's take her to Trauma 2.
- Okay.

01:10.978 --> 01:12.519
Kenny, call Janet. Let her know I'm here.

01:12.543 --> 01:14.362
- And I'll be home in an hour.
- Got it.

01:20.761 --> 01:24.473
[Monitor beeping]

01:24.497 --> 01:26.035
Scott: MRI showed a stroke.

01:26.059 --> 01:29.182
- Clotting from the pregnancy?
- It looks that way. Yeah.

01:29.206 --> 01:30.613
- You give her TPA?
- We did.

01:30.637 --> 01:31.745
And we broke up the clot,

01:31.769 --> 01:33.513
but she had significant
swelling in her brain,

01:33.537 --> 01:35.139
and she's been in a coma since the stroke.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.795
I've been here with her the whole time.

01:36.819 --> 01:38.248
And... and... and the baby?

01:38.272 --> 01:39.545
The baby looks fine, for now.

01:39.568 --> 01:41.169
But we're monitoring things.

01:41.193 --> 01:43.753
[Exhales sharply]

01:43.777 --> 01:45.216
Hey.

01:49.935 --> 01:52.335
I'll give you some privacy.

01:57.344 --> 01:59.659
So, what happens now?

01:59.683 --> 02:01.507
We'll try to make Ali as
comfortable as possible

02:01.531 --> 02:03.323
until the donor heart arrives,

02:03.347 --> 02:05.414
and then Dr. Clemmens will
perform the transplant.

02:05.901 --> 02:09.258
Hey. How's Jordan?

02:09.282 --> 02:11.139
Not good. Still in a coma.

02:11.356 --> 02:12.841
We need the swelling to go down.

02:12.865 --> 02:14.295
T.C.'s never gonna forgive himself

02:14.318 --> 02:15.096
for not being here with her.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.377
He was a wreck on that plane.

02:16.401 --> 02:18.130
Yeah, well, maybe he never should've left.

02:18.283 --> 02:20.981
Hello. I'm Dr. Clemmens. Welcome.

02:21.005 --> 02:23.308
- This is my wife Farrah.
- Hello.

02:23.332 --> 02:24.148
Nice to meet you.

02:24.172 --> 02:26.257
Hey, Scott, can I talk to you?

02:26.281 --> 02:27.407
Excuse us.

02:31.527 --> 02:34.322
- He's got a temp of 101.
- Yeah, I saw that,

02:34.346 --> 02:35.790
and we can't do an organ transplant

02:35.814 --> 02:37.498
on someone running a fever.

02:37.522 --> 02:39.225
If Ali has a-an infection,

02:39.249 --> 02:41.352
we put in a new heart, put
him on immunosuppresants,

02:41.376 --> 02:43.815
- he could die.
- I know. That's why I'm telling you.

02:43.839 --> 02:45.141
I didn't want to say
anything in front of them.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.501
So, we figure out what's causing the fever.

02:47.525 --> 02:48.614
Yeah. Okay.

02:48.638 --> 02:50.283
Is something wrong?

02:50.307 --> 02:52.139
Um, no. No, no. Everything's fine.

02:52.163 --> 02:53.955
We just need to run a few tests.

law enforcement are in fact

on, people. Come on, people.

damn TV all night long.

Let's start treating our homeless
guests in the waiting room.

03:04.343 --> 03:06.456
They probably haven't seen any
medical care in a long time.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.171
Hey, Paul. Can you help me diagnose?

03:08.195 --> 03:09.012
Oh, yeah, sure. No prob.

03:09.036 --> 03:10.329
What's the situation with your hand?

03:10.353 --> 03:11.477
Still a little weak.

03:11.501 --> 03:13.206
Uh, the infection's gone,
but I have some nerve damage.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.920
- My dad's looking at surgical options for me.
- Ah.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.362
If anyone could help, it'll be your dad.

03:16.385 --> 03:18.241
Just hope I didn't screw up
my peds surgical fellowship.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.802
I thought you were still
on the fence about that.

03:19.826 --> 03:22.257
Losing that choice really puts
things into focus, you know.

03:22.281 --> 03:24.009

03:34.032 --> 03:35.184
Yeah, I had to come in.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.645
I'm on the bone-marrow donation list,

03:36.669 --> 03:38.376
and, uh, we got a match
to a kid in St. Louis,

03:38.400 --> 03:39.530
so I got to get to him ASAP.

- But we do know that...
- Kenny's still mad at me?

03:44.192 --> 03:46.281
No. Hardly. Just Gwen's out on the
scene that's going down right now.

03:46.305 --> 03:48.641
- T.C. out there with her?
- Oh, come on. I'll give you an update.

- And, oh, F.Y.I., you may be working tonight.
- All right, great.

us to stand even further back

snipers have broken down.

- She's okay. Good.

- Drew's with her.

- It's almost over.
- What?

07:41.280 --> 07:42.954
Maybe it is.

08:14.109 --> 08:17.373
- Okay.
- * on a star tonight *

08:17.397 --> 08:19.893
I got to say, I, uh, thought army guys

08:19.917 --> 08:21.406
were smarter than running
into a burning building.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.939
- Oh, no. You don't know many army guys.
- Mm.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.535
Um, so, thanks. Uh...

08:25.559 --> 08:27.413
And thanks for loaning me

08:27.437 --> 08:29.057
this... this really cute sweater.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.196
I think it's your color.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.195
Yeah. Yeah, I wanted
to give it back to you,

08:32.219 --> 08:33.687
but I figured since I got it dirty,

08:33.711 --> 08:35.317
I should get it dry-cleaned first.

08:35.341 --> 08:38.217
- Okay.
- Okay, but maybe I should get your number.

08:38.241 --> 08:39.921
* I shoot him twice *

08:39.943 --> 08:42.587
- So I can get it back to you when it's ready.
- * I couldn't help it *

08:42.611 --> 08:44.217
* The bullets flew out of my mouth *

08:44.241 --> 08:46.225
Or, since we work at the same hospital,

08:46.249 --> 08:48.937
you could always drop it
off at the nurses station.

08:48.961 --> 08:51.106
Yeah, but, uh, but then
you'll be missing out

08:51.130 --> 08:52.794
on a really amazing dinner.

08:52.818 --> 08:56.205
I'd hate for that to happen to you.

08:56.229 --> 08:58.980
* 'Cause it's a roller-coaster ride *

08:59.642 --> 09:03.199
Okay. After the shift. One drink.

09:03.223 --> 09:07.059
- I'll take it.
- * it's a fortune-teller's life *

09:07.127 --> 09:09.573
- Is that that army dude?
- Yes.

09:09.597 --> 09:12.303
- Girl, he looks like trouble.
- I know. He is so cute.

09:12.327 --> 09:14.169
Unh-unh. Two first-year residents?

09:14.194 --> 09:16.241
Girl, don't get your penis
where you get your paycheck.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.096
- * Hush, my darling *
- Wow.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.557
- Is that Shakespeare?
- * Sweet dreams tonight *

09:19.581 --> 09:20.298
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

09:20.322 --> 09:21.850
A little something I wrote just for you.

09:21.874 --> 09:24.188
- It's charming.
- You're welcome.

09:24.414 --> 09:28.638
* Do, do, do-do-do, do-do-do *

09:28.892 --> 09:30.477
Topher: Any word from UNOS?

09:30.501 --> 09:32.837
Yeah. I spoke to them, and they're waiting,

09:32.861 --> 09:35.069
but if Ali isn't ready
for transplant by morning,

09:35.093 --> 09:36.501
someone else will get that heart.

09:36.525 --> 09:38.075
No! No! Can they do that?

09:38.099 --> 09:38.727
Farrah.

09:38.751 --> 09:39.888
We'll figure this out before then.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.807
It'll be okay.

09:42.687 --> 09:44.189
Has this been there?

09:44.213 --> 09:46.490
No, Ali, do you feel pain in your chest?

09:46.514 --> 09:49.080
No. But I am feeling a bit dizzy.

09:50.145 --> 09:53.264
He's bleeding! What is wrong with him?

09:53.288 --> 09:55.689
- Topher: Farrah, you should step out.
- No! I will not leave his side.

09:55.713 --> 09:57.308
- We need to start a platelet transfusion.
- [Rapid beeping]

09:57.332 --> 09:59.729
- Ali! Ali! Ali!!
- Two units of platelets.

10:00.153 --> 10:02.389
We believe you may have
broken your collarbone.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.741
I can't pay. At least, not all of it.

10:04.765 --> 10:05.759
I can give you some money.

10:05.783 --> 10:07.670
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

10:07.695 --> 10:09.807
I do work, at a coffee shop.

10:09.831 --> 10:11.027
The boss there is really nice.

10:11.051 --> 10:13.329
He lets me snag sandwiches
and free pastries.

10:13.353 --> 10:14.768
It's not a lot of money.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.135
I just can't afford a place yet.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.932
So where do you stay?

10:17.956 --> 10:20.522
I usually sleep in my
car and shower at the "Y."

10:20.890 --> 10:23.060
The cops want everyone off the streets,

10:23.083 --> 10:25.389
so no sleeping in my car tonight.

10:25.585 --> 10:27.794
So I went to the shelter and then... ow...

10:27.818 --> 10:28.907
now I'm here.

10:29.057 --> 10:30.817
Sounds like a pretty hard day today.

10:30.841 --> 10:32.537
Uh, we'll need an X-ray.

10:32.561 --> 10:34.936
It is what it is. Life is hard.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.145
No one gives you anything for free,

10:36.169 --> 10:38.299
- except for maybe X-rays.
- Paul: Mm.

10:38.323 --> 10:39.895
- Aah.
- Okay.

10:39.918 --> 10:42.035
Let's get this shoulder looked at.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.624
Jocelyn, could you help Maya put a gown on?

10:44.648 --> 10:46.351
- We're gonna step out.
- Of course.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.230
Here you go.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.677
[Monitor beeping] I'll be sure to tell her

10:52.701 --> 10:54.140
how well you took care of her.

10:54.164 --> 10:57.224
Yeah, well, I need the
bonus points when she wakes.

10:57.248 --> 10:58.183
[Chuckles]

10:58.207 --> 11:00.649
- T.C.
- She's seizing.

11:00.673 --> 11:02.949
Start a gram of Dilantin
and hang some Mag Sulfate.

11:02.973 --> 11:04.674
It could be eclampsia.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.463
[Rapid beeping]

11:05.486 --> 11:07.268
- Her sats are down.
- She's not moving any air.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.733
- Start an intubation tray.
- Heart rate's down, T.C. hurry!

11:10.927 --> 11:13.396
Baby, come on.

11:13.588 --> 11:15.636
Esophagus is clear, neck is stable.

11:16.116 --> 11:18.814
Drew, the detective is pushing to
come in and question the patient.

11:18.838 --> 11:20.365
No way. He comes in here, gets in our way,

11:20.389 --> 11:21.654
his only lead dies. He can wait.

11:21.678 --> 11:23.924
Joey: This hip wound is
tracking towards his abdomen.

11:23.948 --> 11:25.288
I need to probe the entrance wound.

11:25.312 --> 11:28.015
[Groaning] What are you doing?

11:28.039 --> 11:30.795
Come on, man. I need
some meds for the pain.

11:30.819 --> 11:33.200
No, no, no, no. What you
really need is a good lawyer.

11:33.224 --> 11:36.104
Okay. Okay, fine.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.620
If I tell you where he is,

11:37.644 --> 11:39.597
will you give me something for the pain?

11:39.621 --> 11:41.265
Yeah, we'll give you something.

11:41.289 --> 11:43.731
Okay, I'll tell you where he is.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.997
- [Weakly] He's at...
- Hey.

11:46.021 --> 11:47.403
Come on.

11:47.427 --> 11:49.160
Hey! Hey!

11:49.203 --> 11:51.467
- Aah!
- [Laughs]

11:51.491 --> 11:53.841
- You son of a bitch!
- You all right? Drew, you okay?

11:53.865 --> 11:54.857
I told ya I'd get ya.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.771
Blood pressure's dropping.

11:56.795 --> 11:58.479
The bullet bounced off
his ilium into his abdomen.

11:58.503 --> 11:59.371
He's bleeding out.

11:59.395 --> 12:01.035
We need to get him to the O.R. right now.

12:01.164 --> 12:03.387
Move! Move out of the way!

12:03.411 --> 12:05.207
- Krista, step in.
- Krista: Ready to go.

12:29.719 --> 12:31.416
I have been over and over the labs,

12:31.440 --> 12:33.453
and it looks like it is eclampsia,

12:33.476 --> 12:35.692
so good call on starting
the magnesium when you did.

12:35.716 --> 12:37.385
Well, she doesn't have
hyperreflexia or edema,

12:37.409 --> 12:38.886
so maybe we're just jumping to conclusions.

12:38.910 --> 12:40.398
- T.C...
- You guys, I just got a call,

12:40.422 --> 12:41.224
so I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?

12:41.248 --> 12:42.183
- Sure.
- All right.

12:42.207 --> 12:43.334
Look, hey.

12:43.357 --> 12:45.412
I can't even imagine how difficult this is,

12:45.436 --> 12:46.972
but you know what this means.

12:46.996 --> 12:48.916
- The pregnancy is toxic to her.
- Scott.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.286
If Jordan was awake, she'd
want us to do everything we can

12:51.310 --> 12:53.121
to save the baby.

12:53.328 --> 12:55.424
[Coughing]

12:56.242 --> 12:58.284
Okay, that's not a seizure.
She's bucking the ventilator.

12:58.308 --> 12:59.618
Hey, hey. Shh.

12:59.642 --> 13:01.537
Push a mg of Ativan.

13:01.561 --> 13:04.089
- [Coughing continues]
- Hey. Shh.

13:04.766 --> 13:07.358
It's uncomfortable. At least
that means she can feel it.

13:10.084 --> 13:12.867
Okay, it looks like that's working for now,

13:12.868 --> 13:14.196
- but...
- Let's run some tests.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.132
All right, I want to be 1,000% sure.

13:16.156 --> 13:19.526
We're not doing anything drastic
unless I'm absolutely certain.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.955
[Sighs] I get it.

13:26.979 --> 13:29.555
Run your tests. I got to go check on Ali.

13:29.579 --> 13:31.116
Call me if you need me.

13:33.572 --> 13:35.874
Hey, sweetheart, hey.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.029
I'm here, Jordan. I'm here.

13:38.052 --> 13:39.563
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

13:39.789 --> 13:43.117
There you go. Let me see your eyes.

13:43.141 --> 13:44.680
- [Camera shutter clicks]
- [Laughs]

13:44.704 --> 13:46.383
- No funny faces, all right?
- Why not?

13:46.407 --> 13:48.204
- We got two more to go.
- That's why you're in a photo booth, right?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.404
- Just serious.
- Okay, fine. Serious, serious, serious.

13:50.428 --> 13:52.024
- [Camera shutter clicks]
- [Laughs]

13:52.048 --> 13:53.867
- Really?
- Yes.

13:53.891 --> 13:56.099
- Sorry.
- I love you.

13:56.123 --> 13:57.915
[Camera shutter clicks]

13:57.939 --> 14:00.051
*****

14:05.094 --> 14:07.741
So, I wasn't expecting this tonight.

14:07.765 --> 14:09.142
- Tell me about it.
- Yeah.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.950
- I'm really worried about Jordan.
- Jordan's a fighter.

14:12.198 --> 14:13.798
She'll pull through.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.114
So, after you do this bone-marrow donation,

14:18.115 --> 14:20.676
you're leaving again in a few days?

14:20.700 --> 14:22.720
Yeah. Liberia.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.364
How long are you gone for again?

14:24.649 --> 14:26.986
I don't know. As long as they need me.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.738
Okay.

14:29.604 --> 14:31.394
Yeah, but, I mean, I'll have breaks.

14:31.395 --> 14:33.820
You could come visit.

14:33.844 --> 14:37.107
We could meet up in Italy. You ever been?

14:37.165 --> 14:39.809
To Italy? No.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.517
Oh, you'll love it. It's great.

14:41.541 --> 14:44.454
The Greek isles it's beautiful.

14:44.478 --> 14:46.525
We'll have a great time.

14:48.186 --> 14:49.787
Woman: Excuse me, Dr. Chavez.

14:49.811 --> 14:50.916
The patient is ready.

14:50.940 --> 14:52.684
All right. They're ready for us.

14:52.708 --> 14:53.860
Yeah. Let's scrub up.

14:56.163 --> 14:59.619
Hello. So, uh, sorry about the wait.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.083
But the cops have to lock down
the hallway because of the sniper,

15:02.084 --> 15:03.964
so it's a little backed
up in imaging right now.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.059
That's so scary.

15:05.082 --> 15:06.746
Have there been a lot of victims?

15:06.770 --> 15:09.180
From the shooters? Uh,
we've had several of them.

15:09.204 --> 15:11.076
Really? Did you see anyone die?

15:11.100 --> 15:15.435
Actually, the, um... first
victim was my patient.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.601
No way. What happened?

15:17.625 --> 15:20.108
Was in a car accident.

15:20.132 --> 15:21.986
Dr. Cummings here found him first.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.235
And he died?

15:23.357 --> 15:25.629
Never had a chance. His head was wrapped.

15:25.653 --> 15:27.318
We thought it was trauma from the accident,

15:27.342 --> 15:28.739
but, uh, he had been shot.

15:28.763 --> 15:31.483
Yeah, it was my first case.
I had to tell his wife.

15:31.507 --> 15:34.291
When she came in, she was in so much pain.

15:34.315 --> 15:35.932
It was...

15:35.956 --> 15:37.370
It was hard.

15:38.824 --> 15:40.936
I'll never get used to that.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.129
- That sounds terrible.
- Yeah.

15:43.459 --> 15:45.749
- Okay, I'm gonna go see if radiology is open yet.
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:45.773 --> 15:48.460
- Uh, do you want any chips or anything?
- No, no. Thank you.

15:48.484 --> 15:51.044
Okay. All right.

15:56.613 --> 15:58.661
Ragosa: Yeah, it was my first case.

15:58.685 --> 15:59.947
I had to tell his wife.

15:59.971 --> 16:02.262
When she came in, she was in so much pain.

16:02.286 --> 16:03.710
It was...

16:03.734 --> 16:05.934
It was hard.

16:06.636 --> 16:08.465
I'll never get used to that.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.121
Maya: That sounds terrible.

16:10.161 --> 16:11.569
[Monitor beeping]

16:12.195 --> 16:13.186
Topher: The bleeding's stopped,

16:13.217 --> 16:14.520
but I still don't know what's causing this.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.251
I've got him on broad spectrum antibiotics,

16:16.275 --> 16:18.541
- but the fever's only going up.
- [Sighs]

16:18.565 --> 16:21.003
I'm getting really nervous
about this transplant.

16:21.027 --> 16:22.627
Yeah, I've been nervous about that

16:22.651 --> 16:23.807
since you walked through the door.

16:23.831 --> 16:26.200
- And UNOS keeps calling for updates.
- I know, I know.

16:26.225 --> 16:28.591
Maybe it's not bacterial.
Maybe it's parasitic.

16:28.615 --> 16:30.535
I didn't see any bug bites on him, though.

16:30.559 --> 16:32.382
At this point, I'm willing to try anything.

16:32.406 --> 16:34.076
- We'll figure this out.
- Okay.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.002
Dr. Zia, your wife is here.

16:36.026 --> 16:38.011
- Janet's here? What the hell?
- Yeah.

16:38.035 --> 16:39.636
Tell her I'll meet her in
the break room in a minute.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.101
You got it.

16:43.194 --> 16:45.690
[Sighs]

16:49.620 --> 16:52.019
Is my husband going to die?

16:52.561 --> 16:56.142
Farrah, we're gonna do everything we can.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.319
You have to do more. You owe him.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.626
I know... I know I do.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.611
He saved my life.

17:04.471 --> 17:08.342
When you left, when the Americans left,

17:08.366 --> 17:10.377
do you know what the village elders did

17:10.402 --> 17:11.978
to collaborators like Ali?

17:13.205 --> 17:14.843
I'm s-sure it was very horrible.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.058
They burned down our home

17:16.082 --> 17:17.330
because they're afraid the Taliban

17:17.355 --> 17:18.507
would kill everyone in the village.

17:18.531 --> 17:20.835
We have been through too much.

17:20.858 --> 17:22.522
You have to save him.

17:22.546 --> 17:23.762
I'm sorry, Topher.

17:23.787 --> 17:25.910
- Just...
- Janet's not going to wait.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.726
I really think you need
to see her, like, now.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.641
Okay, okay.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.167
I'll be... I'll be right back, I promise.

17:32.191 --> 17:34.625
No more promises. Just do it.

17:46.179 --> 17:47.773
There's a sniper out.
What are you doing here?

17:47.797 --> 17:48.613
What are you doing here?

17:48.637 --> 17:50.118
You... you said you were gonna be home

17:50.142 --> 17:52.763
as soon as you landed.
You haven't even called me.

17:52.787 --> 17:54.861
- I told Kenny to call you.
- Kenny is not my husband.

17:54.885 --> 17:56.121
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- No.

17:56.144 --> 17:58.360
Things with Ali got
worse than I anticipated,

17:58.384 --> 18:00.780
but I'm fine. I'll be home as soon as...

18:00.805 --> 18:03.493
No, no, no, no. I am so tired
of you breaking your promises.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.856
- Janet...
- Do you have any idea

18:04.880 --> 18:06.505
what the last few days
have been like for me?

18:06.528 --> 18:07.127
For Lynn?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.386
We had no idea whether or not

18:08.409 --> 18:10.329
you were ever coming back.

18:10.686 --> 18:12.801
- I-I'm back. I'm back now.
- Are you?

18:12.825 --> 18:15.113
Look, I know how much
this Ali means to you,

18:15.137 --> 18:16.929
but I need us to mean more.

18:16.953 --> 18:18.612
You... you are. How can you even...

18:18.636 --> 18:21.164
You left your family to go to a war zone

18:21.188 --> 18:22.724
when you didn't have to.

18:22.748 --> 18:25.052
You could've let someone
else take that risk.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.772
- I'm sorry.
- No.

18:26.796 --> 18:31.021
No, I am just so tired of
keeping all this anger in.

18:31.045 --> 18:33.485
- I... I never asked you to keep it in.
- Yes, you did.

18:33.509 --> 18:35.853
- No.
- Yeah, you don't know it, but you do.

18:35.877 --> 18:37.126
You need your rest from work,

18:37.150 --> 18:39.199
you need to talk to your patients 24/7,

18:39.223 --> 18:41.224
and I try to leave you alone,

18:41.248 --> 18:43.225
but I never get the time
just to be angry, too.

18:43.249 --> 18:45.354
And this was the last straw.

18:45.379 --> 18:47.217
I am done.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.470
[Scoffs] What are you saying?

18:50.494 --> 18:53.841
I'm saying that I came here
to say to you in person...

18:54.701 --> 18:56.397
Not to come home.

18:56.421 --> 18:57.555
[Scoffs]

I am so happy that you're
home and that you're okay,

19:04.724 --> 19:06.516
but I can't do this anymore.

19:06.540 --> 19:08.647
You... Janet, I'm sorry!

19:08.671 --> 19:10.917
- Just wait!
- Hey, Janet.

19:11.787 --> 19:13.877
What... what is it, Drew?

19:13.901 --> 19:16.065
Uh, I just got of the phone with UNOS.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.913
They have another recipient for the heart

19:17.937 --> 19:19.539
and they wanted to know the status of Ali.

19:19.563 --> 19:20.395
What... what did you tell them?

19:20.419 --> 19:21.853
- I said he was fine.
- Okay.

19:21.877 --> 19:23.637
But you know that if he's
not ready for that transplant

19:23.661 --> 19:25.461
in the next couple of
hours, they are moving on.

19:25.484 --> 19:27.427

you with any news. I promise.

20:23.207 --> 20:25.425
and the cops aren't going
to find the second sniper.

It's not an infection.

27:39.209 --> 27:40.969
Coming or leaving?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.953
I'm leaving. Definitely leaving.

27:43.977 --> 27:45.329
"Escaping" is more like it.

27:45.353 --> 27:47.024
Oof. That bad, huh?

27:47.048 --> 27:49.189
Oh. Um, you know,

27:49.213 --> 27:51.071
it probably wasn't even
really the guy's fault.

27:51.095 --> 27:52.689
It's just first date after the breakup,

27:52.712 --> 27:53.789
and it's been six months,

27:53.814 --> 27:55.866
but my friend, she told me
to get back on the horse.

27:55.890 --> 27:58.141
It just turns out... not that horse.

27:58.171 --> 27:59.514
[Chuckles]

27:59.538 --> 28:00.538
[Sighs]

28:02.268 --> 28:03.676
I'm sorry.

28:03.700 --> 28:06.175
Um, you are waiting for my insurance card,

28:06.199 --> 28:09.164
and [Chuckles] I am standing
here blabbering like an idiot

28:09.188 --> 28:11.153
- about my love life.
- Uh, you know what? Hang on.

28:11.177 --> 28:12.581
Hang on, hang on. I got a better idea.

28:12.605 --> 28:14.397
How about you buy me dessert,

28:14.421 --> 28:16.915
I'll pay for dinner, and we call it even?

28:19.592 --> 28:21.768
Uh...

28:21.769 --> 28:23.689
Dessert doesn't really cover that scratch.

28:23.713 --> 28:26.689
Uh, no, no. It probably doesn't,

28:26.713 --> 28:29.881
but ending my bad streak
of first dates might.

28:31.190 --> 28:32.758
What do you say?

28:32.782 --> 28:35.089
Okay. [Chuckles]

28:35.113 --> 28:37.524
Okay. Scott.

28:37.548 --> 28:38.964
Jordan.

28:40.810 --> 28:44.331
[Monitor beeping]

28:44.355 --> 28:45.401
[Indistinct conversations]

28:45.425 --> 28:46.673
Hey. Hey, Paul.

28:46.697 --> 28:47.944
Hey.

28:47.945 --> 28:50.874
I'm, uh, I'm sorry about earlier.

28:51.121 --> 28:53.103
Saying that you could've learned from Maya,

28:53.104 --> 28:54.741
you know, I didn't mean to
make light of your problem.

28:54.765 --> 28:56.366
No, not at all, man. Uh, you were right.

28:56.631 --> 29:00.471
And, uh, in other news,
I just heard from my dad.

29:00.741 --> 29:02.901
Uh, he found a surgery for my hand.

29:02.925 --> 29:05.194
50% chance I regain full function,

29:05.218 --> 29:08.401
and, um, 50% chance they
cause further damage.

29:08.425 --> 29:09.368
Oh. Yeah.

29:09.391 --> 29:10.778
Those are not good odds.

29:10.802 --> 29:13.330
Well, what if you don't have the surgery?

29:13.429 --> 29:14.978
Well, a slow recovery.

29:15.002 --> 29:16.590
I mean, I would... I
would never be a surgeon,

29:16.614 --> 29:19.250
but I could be a functioning
E.R. doc in a couple weeks.

29:19.274 --> 29:21.449
It's your choice, right?

29:21.473 --> 29:22.881
Bird in the hand?

29:23.273 --> 29:25.792
Yeah, um, I hadn't really thought about it.

29:25.816 --> 29:27.617
Uh, what... what are
you... what do you think?

29:28.232 --> 29:29.942
I don't know, man.

29:29.966 --> 29:31.139
It's your life,

29:31.163 --> 29:34.362
but take it from a guy
who blew it 20 years ago.

29:34.386 --> 29:35.987
You could lose all this.

29:36.011 --> 29:38.114
I don't know if it's
worth the risk, you know?

29:39.094 --> 29:43.177
Hey. Why don't we sit down after the shift,

29:43.201 --> 29:45.713
- make a list, talk to Scott?
- Everybody pipe down!

29:45.737 --> 29:47.882
They have a picture of the second sniper.

29:47.906 --> 29:50.434
Woman: Police officials say
that fingerprints have revealed

29:50.458 --> 29:52.060
the identity of the second sniper.

29:52.084 --> 29:53.783
Her name is Brianna Ward.

29:53.807 --> 29:55.675
Investigators are asking
anyone with information to...

29:55.699 --> 29:57.457
- Holy cow.
- Officer, she's here!

29:57.481 --> 29:59.849
Contact San Antonio police
immediately. Do not approach.

29:59.873 --> 30:02.090
She is considered armed and dangerous.

30:02.114 --> 30:05.412
Maya! We know who you a...

30:09.393 --> 30:12.600
Jocelyn, get me Dr. Chavez now!

30:16.889 --> 30:18.339
[Flatline]

30:18.362 --> 30:19.587
All right, I'm inflating the cuff

30:19.611 --> 30:20.830
and using it as a tourniquet.

30:20.853 --> 30:21.749
Hang another saline.

30:21.773 --> 30:22.958
Here.

30:22.982 --> 30:24.891
We found her coded. She bled out.

30:24.915 --> 30:26.330
Use the O-Negative.

30:26.687 --> 30:28.158
She's the second shooter?

30:28.182 --> 30:29.255
- Yeah.
- Come on.

30:29.279 --> 30:30.814
You don't get to decide how you die.

30:30.838 --> 30:32.818
Anybody know how long she's been bleeding?

30:32.841 --> 30:33.929
Long enough.

30:33.953 --> 30:34.991
Hold CPR.

30:35.016 --> 30:36.447
[Monitor beeping]

30:37.459 --> 30:39.156
Drew: Her B.P.'s coming back.

30:39.180 --> 30:40.049
Come on.

30:40.073 --> 30:41.900
B.P. 90 systolic. She's stabilizing.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.870
Okay, good. Hang another
two units of blood.

30:43.893 --> 30:45.615
I want her healthy for her day in court.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.984
Let's get her to Trauma 1 right now.

30:53.944 --> 30:56.120
Yeah, nice save.

30:56.144 --> 30:57.473
I should've known.

30:57.497 --> 30:59.417
She seemed, uh...

30:59.441 --> 31:02.728
I feel so stupid!

31:03.437 --> 31:06.302
- I really believed her.
- Yeah, we both did.

31:06.326 --> 31:08.157
That's why I'm getting
the surgery on my hand.

31:08.249 --> 31:11.001
I thought you'd want to wait
to think about it some more.

31:11.025 --> 31:12.626
This sealed it.

31:12.882 --> 31:14.957
I can't keep a professional boundary

31:14.981 --> 31:17.189
when I see pain every day.

31:17.522 --> 31:19.540
You know, this isn't even first case.

31:19.564 --> 31:24.236
I mean, I need... I need
the distance of surgery.

31:24.260 --> 31:25.311
I need to be somewhere

31:25.334 --> 31:27.082
where every case isn't like a gut punch.

31:27.106 --> 31:29.378
You know, where it doesn't
stick with me for a week.

31:29.402 --> 31:30.618
[Breathes deeply]

31:30.642 --> 31:31.829
Where I don't end up going fishing

31:31.853 --> 31:34.189
with my dead patient's dad, you know?

31:35.380 --> 31:37.332
And if the surgery doesn't work?

31:37.356 --> 31:39.116
Yeah, I'll deal with that then.

31:39.140 --> 31:41.809
I'll deal with that then.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.886
[Sighs]

31:45.910 --> 31:47.907
[Monitor beeping]

31:54.617 --> 31:57.228
[Gasps] She squeezed my hand.

31:57.252 --> 31:58.676
Purposeful movements.

31:58.699 --> 32:00.795
Must mean the swelling in
her brain is going down.

32:00.819 --> 32:02.291
Jordan?

32:02.315 --> 32:05.027
Don't you go scaring us
like that again, okay?

32:05.051 --> 32:07.022
Hey, Jordan.

32:07.481 --> 32:09.210
We're here with you.

32:09.234 --> 32:11.087
Hey, come on.

32:11.938 --> 32:13.658
Oh, God, is she...

32:13.751 --> 32:17.119
[Sighs] Looks like it.

32:25.384 --> 32:27.401
- You need some time alone with her?
- Yeah.

32:27.425 --> 32:28.425
Okay.

32:28.886 --> 32:31.237
Hey.

32:33.681 --> 32:35.847
You're okay.

32:37.803 --> 32:40.336
The baby?

32:45.543 --> 32:47.706
No. Shh, shh, shh.

32:47.730 --> 32:50.793
[Sniffles]

32:50.817 --> 32:53.056
[Monitor beeping]

32:53.608 --> 32:56.201
[Breathing shakily]

33:00.069 --> 33:01.727
Farrah.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.399
I'm here, Ali.

33:06.423 --> 33:07.818
You made it.

33:07.842 --> 33:09.766
You are going to get your heart.

33:09.791 --> 33:11.202
Topher: The treatment worked.

33:11.226 --> 33:13.611
Dr. Clemmens is gonna take you to the O.R.

33:13.635 --> 33:15.899
I don't know how to thank you, Topher.

33:15.923 --> 33:19.251
The lengths you have gone
through to make this happen.

33:19.275 --> 33:21.600
You are a man of your word.

33:21.625 --> 33:22.725
Thank you.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.772
I'm sorry I was so angry with you before.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.480
[Chuckles] I seem to
bring that out in wives.

33:29.504 --> 33:32.384
Never mind. It's inside joke.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.507
I hear we're ready for transplant.

33:34.531 --> 33:35.802
Yes.

33:37.660 --> 33:40.313
There are no words for
what you have given us.

33:40.337 --> 33:41.663
- All right.
- All right.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.240
Here we go.

33:45.226 --> 33:48.447
Hey. Looks like the second
sniper pulled through.

33:48.471 --> 33:50.426
Yeah. Healthy enough to rot in jail

33:50.450 --> 33:51.822
the rest of her life.

33:51.846 --> 33:53.625
- Good.
- What are you doing?

33:53.649 --> 33:54.716
Want to... want to go for breakfast?

33:54.740 --> 33:56.628
Maybe we can have our first real date.

33:56.652 --> 33:57.967
Um...

34:01.831 --> 34:03.751
I really like you, Joey.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.725
- Ah.
- Yeah.

34:05.749 --> 34:08.138
- [Chuckles]
- But I can't date you.

34:08.161 --> 34:10.434
And it wouldn't really be a date, would it?

34:10.458 --> 34:12.121
'Cause you're here for a
couple days, and then what?

34:12.146 --> 34:13.554
I mean, you...

34:13.702 --> 34:16.409
You go back to Liberia, and I stay here?

34:16.434 --> 34:18.065
No, I mean...

34:18.090 --> 34:19.786
We just keep having fun, and...

34:19.810 --> 34:21.154
[Sighs]

34:21.178 --> 34:22.516
We see where it goes.

34:22.540 --> 34:24.360
Your contract is for three years, Joey.

34:24.385 --> 34:26.639
I don't want to be in a
holding pattern for that long.

34:27.811 --> 34:31.373
[Sighs] I... we're just...

34:31.405 --> 34:33.606
Victims of bad timing.

34:34.492 --> 34:36.443
Yeah. Yeah.

34:36.467 --> 34:38.291
It's, uh, the story of my life.

34:38.315 --> 34:39.701
[Sighs]

34:40.051 --> 34:41.819
Mine, too.

34:41.842 --> 34:44.196

*****

34:58.248 --> 34:59.953
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:59.977 --> 35:00.947
* To be humble *

35:00.971 --> 35:03.352
- What a nice surprise.
- * to be kind *

35:03.376 --> 35:06.960
Uh... Look, I-I didn't want
to tell you on the phone,

35:06.984 --> 35:10.728
um... about me taking the job.

35:10.752 --> 35:13.184
* To a stranger, to a friend *

35:13.208 --> 35:14.616
So you're going.

35:14.921 --> 35:17.768
No, I'm not taking the
job in South Carolina.

35:17.792 --> 35:19.541
I, uh, found a job here

35:19.565 --> 35:22.346
training SWAT Teams and State Police.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.222
That's great.

35:24.246 --> 35:26.102
* We are how we treat each other *

35:26.126 --> 35:27.351
But I-I don't want you

35:27.375 --> 35:29.328
to give up that other job because of me.

35:29.352 --> 35:31.239
I'm giving it up because of us.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.006
* We are one *

35:33.030 --> 35:37.286
Look, when I came back to
you, I made a commitment.

35:37.310 --> 35:39.614
A job isn't important.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.902
This is what matters.

35:41.926 --> 35:44.454
* To be bold, to be brave *

35:44.478 --> 35:46.277
You matter.

35:46.301 --> 35:48.570
* It is the thinking that
the heart can still be saved *

35:48.594 --> 35:50.654
I love you, and I want to be with you here.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.390
* And the darkness can come quick *

35:52.414 --> 35:54.046
I want that, too.

35:54.070 --> 35:56.310
* The danger's in the anger
and the hanging on to it *

35:56.566 --> 35:57.891
What are we waiting for?

35:57.915 --> 35:59.003
Let's just do it.

35:59.252 --> 36:00.825
Do what?

36:00.849 --> 36:02.383
Get married.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.765
[Chuckles]

36:04.789 --> 36:05.989
* We are one *

36:06.013 --> 36:07.107
* We are how we treat each other *

36:07.131 --> 36:08.131
What?

36:09.361 --> 36:10.289
[Sighs]

36:10.313 --> 36:11.557
* When the day is done *

36:11.581 --> 36:14.143
I was actually gonna ask you.

36:14.167 --> 36:18.298
I packed the bags and
made a hotel reservation.

36:18.323 --> 36:20.814
We can be in Santa Fe tonight.

36:20.838 --> 36:22.309
You...?

36:22.333 --> 36:23.401
Yeah.

36:23.425 --> 36:26.002
* Tell me what it is that you see *

36:26.026 --> 36:29.723
[Both laugh]

36:29.747 --> 36:31.919
You were pretty sure I
was gonna say yeah, huh?

36:31.943 --> 36:33.973
Yeah, I was pretty sure.

36:33.997 --> 36:35.245
Huh.

36:35.269 --> 36:36.805
* Heroes don't look like they used to *

36:36.829 --> 36:38.397
I think some things are gonna change.

36:38.421 --> 36:41.013
Clearly, I'm becoming way too predictable.

36:41.037 --> 36:44.531
Well, that's what married
life's all about, right?

36:45.324 --> 36:47.724
We'll find out.

36:59.030 --> 37:01.269
Hey.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.997
Listen, I'm... I'm really
happy to see you, 'cause I...

37:04.021 --> 37:05.418
You know what? I don't want to hear it.

37:05.442 --> 37:06.724
We'll talk about this later,

37:06.749 --> 37:09.040
but now we are going to
Lynn's violin recital.

37:09.064 --> 37:10.546
She's the 23rd performer out of 25,

37:10.570 --> 37:12.522
and we're gonna stay
for the whole damn thing.

37:12.546 --> 37:14.831
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
- And while we are there,

37:14.855 --> 37:16.775
I need you to actually be there with me.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.841
Not thinking about your
patients and your cases,

37:18.864 --> 37:20.336
not checking your cellphone.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.152
I need you to really be there with me

37:22.176 --> 37:23.584
watching your daughter.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.683
It's off.

37:26.672 --> 37:30.064
There's no place I'd rather be, baby.

37:32.883 --> 37:36.448
- [Clears throat]
- * to the place where I belong *

37:38.426 --> 37:40.220
I just don't want anyone to tell me

37:40.244 --> 37:42.004
that I can have another baby.

37:42.028 --> 37:44.044
- * When you go *
- You know?

37:44.068 --> 37:45.429
* Turn down the light *

37:45.453 --> 37:46.563
That I can just...

37:46.587 --> 37:47.693
* No one's there *

37:47.716 --> 37:49.404
Get pregnant again.

37:49.429 --> 37:51.422
* To hold you in the night *

37:51.446 --> 37:53.555
[Sobbing] 'Cause what they don't get

37:53.579 --> 37:57.115
is I can't have this baby.

37:57.139 --> 38:00.160
- * To the place where I belong *
- And I loved this baby.

38:01.258 --> 38:04.821
I didn't know how amazing it
was to be pregnant till I wasn't.

38:04.845 --> 38:08.043
- * When you think you're on your own *
- I just feel empty.

38:08.141 --> 38:11.748
Yeah. I can imagine.

38:11.772 --> 38:13.527
* I'm still coming home *

38:13.552 --> 38:16.616
When I heard its little heart beat...

38:17.079 --> 38:20.915
* When our picture fades in the sun *

38:22.934 --> 38:26.770
I heard you talking to Gwen when I was out.

38:26.794 --> 38:29.770
I heard what you said
about getting married.

38:29.794 --> 38:31.220
* When you fold with the cards *

38:31.244 --> 38:33.156
[Chuckles]

38:33.579 --> 38:36.555
You always had good ears, even in a coma.

38:36.579 --> 38:37.980
[Both chuckle]

38:38.004 --> 38:39.927
* No, I'll never stop fighting *

38:39.951 --> 38:42.831
Yeah. I wanted to make it more romantic,

38:42.855 --> 38:45.941
but... I guess I'm just not very good

38:45.965 --> 38:47.916
at this kind of thing, eh?

38:48.380 --> 38:49.756
Um...

38:49.780 --> 38:51.284
* Wherever we go *

38:51.308 --> 38:54.713
* Wherever we go *

38:54.738 --> 38:56.963
* Wherever we go *

38:57.229 --> 38:59.115
How about it?

38:59.139 --> 39:01.804
You don't have to do this.

39:01.828 --> 39:03.652
* Wherever we go *

39:03.676 --> 39:06.046
You know, don't... don't
do this because you...

39:06.070 --> 39:07.223
* Wherever we go *

39:07.247 --> 39:08.823
You want to make it up to me

39:08.847 --> 39:11.011
or you think it's the right thing or...

39:11.848 --> 39:13.190
You have to prove something.

39:13.214 --> 39:15.292
I'm not trying to prove anything to you.

39:15.526 --> 39:17.127
[Clears throat]

39:17.151 --> 39:19.230
* When the lights are faded to black *

39:19.254 --> 39:20.480
I love you.

39:20.504 --> 39:21.897
* Only stars are guiding me back *

39:21.921 --> 39:25.329
And... We have been
through too much together,

39:25.353 --> 39:28.131
and I can't imagine my life without you.

39:28.156 --> 39:29.436
* I'll keep running *

39:29.460 --> 39:31.380
I've seen what that's like,

39:31.404 --> 39:33.004
and I don't want to go through that again.

39:33.027 --> 39:35.138
* To the place where I belong *

39:35.162 --> 39:36.632
So...

39:36.656 --> 39:39.332
You're my best friend. I'm asking you...

39:39.356 --> 39:40.764
* When you think you're on your own *

39:40.788 --> 39:44.020
Jordan Elizabeth Alexander...

39:44.044 --> 39:45.964
* I'm still coming home *

39:45.988 --> 39:47.972
Will you marry me?

39:50.692 --> 39:55.859
* When you think you're on your own *

39:55.883 --> 39:59.719
* I'm still coming home *

40:00.305 --> 40:06.272
