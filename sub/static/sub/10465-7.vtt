No, I'm not.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.400
I used to with my last
girlfriend all the time.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.133

don't wanna talk about this.

Do you mind?
Sorry.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.234
Well, I'm just--

09:55.234 --> 09:57.734
I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna
get out of these clothes.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.400

pushing this whole

faculty jack-o'-lantern thing.

10:06.334 --> 10:09.167
Does this look anything
like Principal Stickley to you?

10:09.167 --> 10:11.834
Close enough. Heh.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.200
Yeah? Good.

10:15.868 --> 10:18.934
Hey, um, you know how you were
gonna drive me to the dance

10:18.934 --> 10:20.834
and we were gonna
hang out and stuff?

Uh-huh.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.367
Uh, well, would it
be cool with you if, uh--?

10:27.367 --> 10:29.567
You asked Robin Chaffey
instead?

10:31.334 --> 10:34.801
I saw you guys passing notes
in Trimble's class.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.300
I say, go for it.

10:38.901 --> 10:41.133

I'm okay with it.

this whole run

about how she likes
to name everything.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.501
Uh, she named her high tops
Luke and Laura.

11:09.501 --> 11:13.200
Then she named her boots
Mork and Mindy.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.400

when she said it.

come with me and hang
or something.

and the handwriting samples

17:50.133 --> 17:52.734

they will go in here.

by the earth.

behind me

the rest of the house.

together yourself.

so great about this,

19:54.868 --> 19:56.434
Oh, please.

You guys were,
like, a major item.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.334
And, frankly, you're kind of
a tough act to follow.

20:00.334 --> 20:01.834
Oh, that's nice
of you to say, but--

20:01.834 --> 20:03.534
And then Justin tells me
how cool you are

20:03.534 --> 20:04.901

much to me because,

he is such a great guy.

I'm just really glad
you guys are happy.

probably be going.

talking to you, but--

with this dance

I can't do this now.

21:48.133 --> 21:49.834
Why not?

21:49.834 --> 21:51.534
Because we're in a bookstore

all over the place.

finish getting
