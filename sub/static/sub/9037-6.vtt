00:02.635 --> 00:09.508
- [singing] down came the rain
and washed the spider out.

00:12.479 --> 00:18.584
Out came the sun,
dried up all the rain.

00:18.586 --> 00:22.087
Itsy bitsy spider

00:22.089 --> 00:28.093
Went up...The spout...
Again.

00:34.167 --> 00:37.269
Aha!

00:37.271 --> 00:42.408
I love that spider.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.576
You know, they could be fussing
and crying.

00:44.578 --> 00:48.047
You start singing that song,
it's musical chloroform.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.550
- That's great, ray.
Look at this.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.118
You told me you took care
of the car wreck guy,

00:53.120 --> 00:55.454
Got another bill from him.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.623
And the pediatrician
is still sending us the bill

00:57.625 --> 00:59.591
Because you haven't contacted
the insurance company.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.560
- [singing]
the itsy bitsy spider...

01:01.562 --> 01:04.096
- Look, ray, I only asked you
to do a couple of things --

01:04.098 --> 01:05.597
- [singing]
went up the water spout.

01:05.599 --> 01:09.735
Out came the rain.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.735
- Is it so difficult--

01:10.737 --> 01:16.742
- [singing]
washed the spider out.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.110
- Just next time--

01:18.112 --> 01:19.611
- [singing]
frere jacques.

01:23.283 --> 01:24.282
- Hi. I'm ray.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.252
And I live here in long island
with my wife, debra...

01:28.822 --> 01:31.824
My 6-year-old daughter
and twin almost 2-year-old boys.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.353
It's still warm.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.354
Come on,
what's goin' on?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.655
- Yeah, here. Come here.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.524
Sign your parents'
anniversary card.

02:08.561 --> 02:11.630
- Oh, look, a girl puppy
nuzzling a boy puppy.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.898
Hmm.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.566
Well, you've captured them.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.137
"no bones about it,
doggone it.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.672
We love you!"

02:20.674 --> 02:22.274
I'm sorry.
I can't sign that.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.477
- Hey, I have an idea.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.279
Why don't we send them
the card you bought them?

02:28.848 --> 02:31.383
- Now I get it.
I get it now.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.219
"doggone it"
'cause there's dogs on it.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.155
Very clever.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.389
I didn't see it
at first.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.624
I see it now.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.791
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.293
40th anniversary?

02:41.295 --> 02:44.296
- Yep.
- Wow. That's a big one.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.532
Are we--are we
doing anything?

02:46.534 --> 02:49.935
- What do you mean
are we doing anything?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.304
- Well, I mean...40 years.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.506
Is there gonna be a party
or something?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.209
- Oh!
Is there gonna be a party?

02:57.211 --> 02:58.177
- Well, you know, uh--

02:58.179 --> 02:59.211
- Oh, yeah, I know,

02:59.213 --> 03:00.412
That kind of instant party,

03:00.414 --> 03:02.281
Where the earth
just splits open,

03:02.283 --> 03:05.584
And dancing girls
fly out with cupcakes.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.756
- I'd go to that party.
- Yeah.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.790
Such an idiot.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.559
- What? What?

03:13.561 --> 03:15.928
- You're saying I should throw
a party for your parents.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.396
- I didn't say that.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.564
- Why don't you throw them
a party?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.332
They're your parents.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.900
- Is it so important
whose parents they are?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.636
- Yes!

03:24.638 --> 03:27.406
- I'm just saying
someone ought to,

03:27.408 --> 03:28.907
And parties
are your department.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.677
You're so...Festive.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.413
[door opens]
- hey.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.381
- Hey, robert.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.384
- Here's the ointment
I borrowed.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.954
I don't know what happened
to the applicator.

03:46.326 --> 03:48.227
- You know what? Keep it.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.830
Listen, robert...

03:51.832 --> 03:53.332
Are you planning
to do anything

03:53.334 --> 03:54.866
To celebrate
your parents' anniversary?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.668
- Not really.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.605
Why? Is there gonna be, like,
a party or somethin'?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.373
- Debra doesn't want
to make a party.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.741
- Why should I make a party?

04:02.743 --> 04:06.278
- Well, it is
their 40th anniversary.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.380
- Okay, look, if you two
want it on your conscience

04:08.382 --> 04:10.449
That this occasion
went by and you did nothing,

04:10.451 --> 04:11.717
That's fine with me.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.818
I'm out of it.
I got 'em a card.

04:19.792 --> 04:21.660
- So what do you think?

04:21.662 --> 04:24.396
- A party? I don't know.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.698
- Maybe we should, uh...

04:26.700 --> 04:28.667
Get some chips.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.307
- What, like--
like potato chips?

04:35.309 --> 04:36.975
- Yeah.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.277
- I like barbecue.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.544
- Nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.313
- How about
sour cream and onion?

04:41.315 --> 04:44.616
No, wait a minute.
Is that too much?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.917
- Well, I mean,
it is their 40th.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.952
- Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.520
How about some dip?

04:48.522 --> 04:49.955
- You know what?
We don't need dip.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.057
- Yeah, 'cause the chips
are already flavored.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.760
- Right, right, right.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.428
- All right, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.729
What about the main food?

04:57.731 --> 04:58.997
- Pizza?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.733
- Nah.
I had pizza last night.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.768
Chinese?

05:02.770 --> 05:03.935
- No, no.

05:03.937 --> 05:08.040
Dad always imitates
the delivery guy.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.675
- I got it! I got it.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.076
Six-foot hero.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.944
- Six-foot hero!

05:12.946 --> 05:14.780
- Yeah!
It goes with the chips.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.682
- That's good! Good.
We get the chips, sandwich.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.050
We get some ice cream.
Yeah, yeah.

05:18.052 --> 05:19.318
Who can't do this?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.552
- Of course. You see?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.552
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.388
Six-foot hero--
now, that's a lot of food.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.656
I mean, who do we invite?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.391
- Well, you gotta figure
a foot a person.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.926
- Right. Okay.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.395
I can invite
my girlfriend, amy,

05:30.397 --> 05:31.596
A couple guys
from the station.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.098
- I can get kevin
and andy--

05:33.100 --> 05:35.634
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

05:35.636 --> 05:37.402
Just stop!

05:39.539 --> 05:43.442
This is your idea
of a party?

05:43.444 --> 05:47.512
- Didn't you hear?
6-foot hero.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.082
- Here.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.750
- Stan, lee, albert, lucy.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.018
Wha-wha-what's this?

05:53.020 --> 05:56.755
- This is a real guest list
for a party.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.823
- Lee and stan?

05:57.825 --> 06:00.792
That's a party?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.761
- This is not for you!
This is for your parents!

06:02.763 --> 06:04.029
You invite their friends.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.797
And you're not having
a hero sandwich.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.032
It's not a super bowl party.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.900
- Not with lee and stan
it's not.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.069
- All right.
You know what we're gonna do?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.738
We're gonna make it
a surprise party.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.039
We'll have a nice buffet,

06:14.041 --> 06:15.507
Some crudites, pasta salad...

06:15.509 --> 06:16.908
- I thought you didn't
want to do this.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.410
- Well, I have to now

06:18.412 --> 06:21.847
Because I can't let
this chip fest happen.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.115
- Get a lot of ice.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.583
Put a lot of ice--
- yeah.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.684
- Hey, hey!

06:25.686 --> 06:27.519
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

06:27.521 --> 06:28.553
- Hi. Well, you're home early.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.489
How was the happy zone?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.857
- I'm tired!
- Aww...

06:31.859 --> 06:33.625
- Of course you're tired,

06:33.627 --> 06:38.997
Because grandpa was too cheap
to park at the happy zone.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.133
- That lot costs
three bucks an hour.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.402
I found a meter
with time left on it.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.971
- 37 minutes? Ohh!

06:45.973 --> 06:48.507
We had to run back
so we wouldn't get a ticket.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.943
- You call what you do
running?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.079
- I saw other wives
being picked up at the door.

06:54.081 --> 06:58.417
- I wish I could pick up
another wife at the door.

07:03.556 --> 07:07.459
- Maybe we should throw 'em
separate parties.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.196
- Ooh...

07:11.198 --> 07:13.565
That was a wonderful brunch,
you two.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.700
It was lovely.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.136
- But...

07:18.138 --> 07:20.472
- It was a little much.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.840
- We just thought
that you would enjoy

07:21.842 --> 07:23.208
A nice anniversary brunch.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.744
- We don't enjoy things, dear.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.579
- Guess why.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.047
- All right. Come on. Come on.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.016
We're supposed to be
celebrating today, right?

07:31.018 --> 07:34.486
- This marriage is nothing
to celebrate.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.688
- But 40 years,
it's a big milestone.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.823
Think of all
the good times.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.958
- I had one good year.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.092
- There you go.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.161
- The year
I left your mother.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.229
- Surpr--
- what?

07:44.231 --> 07:47.098
- Frank!
The children!

07:47.100 --> 07:49.201
- What's the big secret?
We split up for a year.

07:49.203 --> 07:51.069
I came back, didn't I?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.104
- Wait, wait, wait.
What are you talkin' about?

07:53.106 --> 07:55.941
- We almost got divorced.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.709
- What?

07:57.711 --> 07:58.877
- There's a sad word...

07:58.879 --> 08:00.579
Almost.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.483
- I suppose it can't hurt
to tell you now.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.017
We separated for a year.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.119
It was a terrible time.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.856
- Separated? When?
When was this?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.924
- Oh! It's not important,
dear.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.659
I have to go
to the bathroom.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.828
- Well, I want to know.
No, wait, wait, wait.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.130
- Surprise!

08:19.132 --> 08:20.732
Honk!

08:26.005 --> 08:28.006
- Look, frank, a party.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.275
- Holy crap.

08:30.277 --> 08:31.576
- Oh, look...

08:31.578 --> 08:33.011
- Ma, what is this story?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.714
- Mom, dad,
happy anniversary.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.216
Amy and I have prepared
a few remarks.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.551
- Come with me,
both of you.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.819
- No, no, no.
Your brother's talking.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.053
- [clears throat]

08:42.055 --> 08:45.557
Ehhhh!

08:45.559 --> 08:46.858
"webster's
unabridged dictionary

08:46.860 --> 08:49.761
Defines wedlock as--"

08:49.763 --> 08:50.896
- Just keep toasting.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.063
I'll have them
back in a minute.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.765
- The toast
is for them.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.000
- So's the cake.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.234
- Uh, you know what?

08:56.236 --> 08:57.969
This is just gonna take
a minute, so...

08:57.971 --> 09:00.038
I made a spinach boat,
so party down, everybody.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.273
Hi.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.141
- Hey, I saw cannolis
in there.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.709
- Later.
Listen, I want to know--

09:04.711 --> 09:07.712
- Oh, mel,
thanks for coming.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.748
- You got any
decent scotch?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.182
- Come on.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.951
Mel, please, give us
a minute here.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.120
- I was told
there'd be widows here.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.557
[muttering]

09:18.559 --> 09:20.625
- In there.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.627
When were you guys
separated?

09:22.629 --> 09:24.896
- It was like 30 years ago.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.866
- Ray, I think the time for this
is after the party, okay?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.200
- Nice, raymond.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.735
Very nice.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.638
I practiced.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.640
- Did you know mom and dad
were separated?

09:35.642 --> 09:37.842
- Again?

09:37.844 --> 09:39.210
- Wait, you knew?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.146
Where the hell was I
that year?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.647
- You were
watching television.

09:42.649 --> 09:43.949
- Yeah.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.217
"wild, wild west."

09:46.219 --> 09:47.586
- I'm sorry.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.954
Do you want to blow out
these candles?

09:48.956 --> 09:49.988
- Oh, how lovely.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.656
- No, no, no, no.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.024
No cake until I hear the story.
I'm sorry.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.927
- It's getting very hot.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.629
- All right...

09:57.631 --> 09:59.297
Come on.
Let's hear it.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.665
- Okay.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.167
We'd been living
here in this house.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.969
We had had the kids, and...

10:03.971 --> 10:05.303
When I think about it,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.238
We were a lot like
you and debra.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.673
- What?

10:08.675 --> 10:09.741
- What?
What do you mean?

10:09.743 --> 10:10.742
- Not like us.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.210
- Just like you two.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.014
[theme from
"wild, wild west" plays]

10:16.016 --> 10:17.148
- I think, raymond,
you were six,

10:17.150 --> 10:18.617
And robby was, uh...

10:18.619 --> 10:20.652
- Ten, ma.
It's ray plus four.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.953
- That's right.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.323
But I remember frank and I
were just like you two.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.196
Everything was normal.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.065
We'd had our differences.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.736
But this was the day
I realized the man I married

10:37.738 --> 10:40.338
Had no respect for me
whatsoever.

10:40.340 --> 10:45.877
- Don't make this
a production, marie.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.747
- I remember
I'd been cooking all day,

10:48.749 --> 10:50.315
And you were taking
your own sweet time

10:50.317 --> 10:54.285
Coming down for dinner.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.889
When I think of how many times
I yelled, "frank!"

11:06.332 --> 11:08.933
A nice pot roast,

11:08.935 --> 11:11.202
Little red potatoes,

11:11.204 --> 11:13.104
Carrots
cooked in the sauce.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.306
Before he even tasted
a bite,

11:15.308 --> 11:18.276
He had the nerve
to ask me for salt.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.113
- Salt gives it taste.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.315
- That roast had taste.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.385
It had oregano,
garlic, paprika.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.021
He wouldn't even try it.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.423
- It's my house!

11:31.425 --> 11:34.893
I'm allowed to have salt
if I want!

11:34.895 --> 11:37.295
- Even if it destroys
another person?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.700
[no audio]

11:43.102 --> 11:44.903
- You overreacted.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.338
You're always overreacting.

11:58.150 --> 11:59.884
- You're the one who left.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.219
- You threw me out.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.756
- Champagne for everybody.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.990
- We're busy, mel.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.492
- I've met my bride.
- Congratulations.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.428
- And you thought
I was gay.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.797
- We, uh, should
get out there.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.299
- No, no, no.
Not until they finish.

12:14.301 --> 12:19.337
- Give me a break.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.774
- Please tell me that cheese
is from this party.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.510
- Okay, well,
after your father left,

12:25.512 --> 12:27.178
We didn't talk
for a long time,

12:27.180 --> 12:30.281
And I thought
it was over.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.183
- But then you realized
you made a big mistake

12:32.185 --> 12:33.785
And you got
back together, right?

12:33.787 --> 12:37.856
- Nah. Ray broke his arm.

12:37.858 --> 12:42.761
[theme from "bonanza" plays]

12:42.763 --> 12:43.962
- Wait a minute.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.930
Dad was there
when I broke my arm.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.404
- Yeah, I started coming by
to check on you.

12:59.311 --> 13:02.514
- Yeah, you were very concerned
about raymond.

13:08.387 --> 13:14.192
- He was very sweet
with you, raymond.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.261
- Well, his arm was busted.

13:21.834 --> 13:24.335
- Everything kind of worked out
from there.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.577
[no audio]

14:01.974 --> 14:04.042
- How about that, ray?

14:04.044 --> 14:06.211
There wouldn't even have been
a 40th anniversary

14:06.213 --> 14:08.046
If it wasn't
for your little arm, huh?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.547
- Yeah.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.449
- Can we go now?
I'm out of cheese.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.351
- You just came
from brunch.

14:13.353 --> 14:18.556
- Yeah, like you're not
gonna eat again.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.225
- I'm going in.
You with me?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.526
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.294
Doesn't that story
bother you?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.429
- No. Why should it?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.130
It's water under the bridge.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.999
We all turned out okay.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.234
Crunch!

14:31.303 --> 14:32.904
- God, all this time

14:32.906 --> 14:35.473
I thought
my parents ruined my life.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.575
It turns out
I ruined theirs.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.043
- You didn't ruin theirs.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.411
They got back together
because of you.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.446
- Right!

14:41.448 --> 14:43.214
They could've stayed apart,

14:43.216 --> 14:44.582
Met other people,

14:44.584 --> 14:46.951
Led happy,
fulfilling lives.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.553
- Your parents.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.121
- They were different then.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.489
Didn't you hear my mom?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.491
Back then, they were
just like you and me.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.094
- Yeah, that was
the worst part of that story.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.463
- Debra, dear, the guests
are dipping their cups

14:58.465 --> 15:00.632
Into the punchbowl,
since there's no ladle.

15:00.634 --> 15:04.469
Is that how
you intended it?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.504
- I'll get a ladle.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.375
And they all lived
happily ever after.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.617
- Do you know
what time it is?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.119
Come to bed.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.087
- Can't sleep.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.122
- Oh, listen.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.423
You got to stop
feeling guilty

15:25.425 --> 15:27.225
About getting
your parents back together.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.493
You know what?

15:28.495 --> 15:32.397
Think of them
as, like, a terrible virus.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.698
If they had met
other people,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.333
The misery
would've spread.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.403
You kept it contained.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.971
- It's more than that.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.205
- Oh, what,
we're on to something worse?

15:41.207 --> 15:42.607
- Yes.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.510
- Okay, what are we
having tonight, ray?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.078
- I don't know.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.581
What if you and me...

15:50.583 --> 15:52.016
- What?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.719
- What if--what if we end up
like my parents,

15:54.721 --> 15:56.487
Staying together
just for the kids?

15:56.489 --> 15:57.689
- That would never happen

15:57.691 --> 16:00.224
Because I would take
the kids

16:00.226 --> 16:02.193
And the house.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.462
Here. You can finish that.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.064
Ray!

16:06.066 --> 16:07.632
What, you don't think
we're happy?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.600
- Yeah, sure,
now we're happy.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.336
It's easy to be happy now.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.471
- But you're thinking,
like, what, in 20 years...

16:13.473 --> 16:15.273
- Well, who knows?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.442
My parents must have
been happy once.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.143
If you look
at their wedding pictures,

16:19.145 --> 16:20.712
They're actually smiling

16:20.714 --> 16:22.080
In some of them.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.648
- Ray!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.284
We don't have
to become them.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.252
- They didn't want
to become them!

16:28.254 --> 16:29.520
Nobody wants
to become them!

16:29.522 --> 16:31.122
It--it just happens!

16:31.124 --> 16:33.124
- Nobody else
can become them.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.493
This happened to them
because they're them!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.128
- No!

16:37.130 --> 16:39.163
It happened
because they settled.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.065
Look, they got back together
because of my arm,

16:41.067 --> 16:42.567
And by the time it healed,

16:42.569 --> 16:44.736
They forgot that they were
never supposed to be together.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.337
Now they're stuck.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.006
Till death do they part.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.440
- Oh, they're not stuck.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.042
I mean, come on,
think about it.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.778
There has to be a reason
other than you

16:53.780 --> 16:57.682
Why that marriage
has lasted 40 years, hmm?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.617
Got to be another reason.

16:59.619 --> 17:02.787
- Yeah.
What might that be?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.590
- Spite.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.326
- How is this helping?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.128
- All I know is,

17:10.130 --> 17:11.529
I love you.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.064
Right?
We love each other.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.465
That's why we're together.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.200
Love.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.535
Isn't that enough?

17:20.105 --> 17:22.306
- Yeah,

17:22.308 --> 17:25.343
If you want to put all
your eggs in that basket.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.552
- I just don't know how
you could say that to maxine.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.753
- What did I say?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.488
- What did you say?

17:37.490 --> 17:42.427
It's called
a mental health facility, frank.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.562
You don't walk up to somebody
who's just been released

17:44.564 --> 17:48.533
And say,
"how was the loony bin?"

17:48.535 --> 17:49.534
- She thought it was funny.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.069
She laughed.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.336
- She laughs at everything,
frank.

17:52.338 --> 17:56.507
She's out of her mind.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.409
- Hi.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.844
- Oh, hi.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.246
Did you see how your father
behaved yesterday?

18:02.248 --> 18:03.481
- There was nothing
wrong with me,

18:03.483 --> 18:04.715
And it's my house!

18:04.717 --> 18:06.284
- So that gives you
the right

18:06.286 --> 18:07.819
To unbuckle your pants
in front of people?

18:07.821 --> 18:09.587
- What people?
It's lee and stan.

18:11.256 --> 18:15.259
And maxine thought
that was hysterical.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.494
- You're impossible.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.096
- What about you...

18:18.098 --> 18:19.564
Wanting to dance.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.765
- It was a party.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.867
- Yes! People are eating.

18:22.869 --> 18:27.138
Exactly why you shouldn't dance.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.240
- All right, stop it.
Stop it, will you?

18:29.242 --> 18:30.675
How can you keep
doing this?

18:30.677 --> 18:31.742
- What do you mean?

18:31.744 --> 18:34.679
We're having breakfast.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.547
- Do you hear yourselves?

18:36.549 --> 18:37.849
- What are you yelling?

18:37.851 --> 18:39.750
We're having
a conversation.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.385
- No, no, no, you're not.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.520
This is not a conversation.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.654
This is--it's bickering.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.156
That's all you do.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.791
- Who are you to tell us
what we do?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.493
Leave us alone.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.861
The next time
you want to dance,

18:49.863 --> 18:53.865
Give me notice
so I can kill myself.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.601
- Good.
I'll dance on your grave.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.136
How are the eggs?

18:58.138 --> 18:59.604
- Mmm. They're good.
Could use some more.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.506
- Okay, you want some eggs,
honey?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.508
Sit down.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.642
- Where are the peppers?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.144
- There are no peppers.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.378
You always
ask for peppers,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.713
And then
you get heartburn.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.883
- It's not from the peppers!

19:11.885 --> 19:13.651
Here.
Get in on some of this.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.754
- Here.
Here's the salt.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.789
- Is robert here?

19:18.791 --> 19:20.158
- He's watching television.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.162
How are you eating?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.464
Close your mouth
before you chew.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.367
- Close your mouth
before you talk.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.671
Mmm! These eggs are good.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.739
- Good.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.346
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.814
- Let me ask you
something.

19:43.816 --> 19:47.218
They're, like, happy
in there, aren't they?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.886
- What do you mean?

19:48.888 --> 19:51.189
- I mean--I mean
they're, like, happy

19:51.191 --> 19:52.490
The way they are.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.925
- Yeah.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.259
Of course they're happy.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.761
Thank god.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.830
Otherwise living here
would be very stressful.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.804
- So I guess it wasn't
just my arm, then, huh?

20:06.806 --> 20:09.240
- Oh, yeah, your arm.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.342
You know, I've been meaning
to tell you about that.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.643
You know how you
fell off your bike?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.345
- Yeah.

20:14.347 --> 20:18.583
- Well, you didn't just
fall off your bike.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.551
- What do you mean?

20:20.553 --> 20:24.388
[theme from
"wild, wild west" plays]

20:24.390 --> 20:26.224
- Well, dad was away
so long, you know,

20:26.226 --> 20:27.592
I figured he might
come home sooner

20:27.594 --> 20:28.993
If you had a little...
Accident.

20:54.419 --> 20:59.390
- Are you...Crazy?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.759
I--I flipped
over the handlebars!

21:01.761 --> 21:03.661
I could've been killed!

21:03.663 --> 21:06.597
- Well, I thought of that.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.766
Then dad would have
come to the funeral.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.802
I'm glad we talked
about this.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.038
It's been on my mind.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.349
- How about the time
I fell out of the tree house?

21:25.351 --> 21:28.686
- You.

21:28.688 --> 21:30.521
- Bunk bed collapsing?

21:30.523 --> 21:33.491
- Me.

21:37.996 --> 21:40.564
- Dart in the leg.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.966
- Me. Accident!

21:49.541 --> 21:50.574
- Hamster dying.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.076
- God.

21:54.546 --> 21:58.816
- The time
I almost drowned.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.052
- Lake or ocean?

22:08.327 --> 22:09.593
- Lake.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.696
- You.
