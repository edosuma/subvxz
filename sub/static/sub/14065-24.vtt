00:36.295 --> 00:38.309
The district attorney
is holding to murder one,

00:38.349 --> 00:41.310
so any chance of a plea is…

00:41.310 --> 00:44.498
not that either of you seemed
willing to entertain one.

00:44.538 --> 00:47.654
The more demoralizing news is,

00:47.654 --> 00:50.560
we don't think
that we can win this.

00:51.454 --> 00:53.344
What do you mean?

00:53.344 --> 00:54.448
Mr Crane, uh…

00:54.448 --> 00:57.724
Tell him what you mean.
I already know.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.861
The prosecution has just
presented us with another
piece of evidence they intend to submit.

01:01.901 --> 01:03.614
3 days before your father's death,

01:03.654 --> 01:06.639
Dr Jacob Levine, you were both
seeing this psychiatrist?

01:06.679 --> 01:09.249
But our mother was making us go.
What about him?

01:09.289 --> 01:11.085
As a result of your last session,

01:11.125 --> 01:15.371
the doctor reported to the police that
in his opinion, both you, Michael, and Edward

01:15.411 --> 01:17.408
posed a grave threat to your father's life.

01:17.448 --> 01:21.059
In short, he feared that
you would try to kill him.

01:22.194 --> 01:24.230
We'll try to suppress this,

01:24.230 --> 01:26.983
but we need to seriously
consider changing our plea.

01:27.023 --> 01:28.750
To what?

01:29.099 --> 01:31.988
Not guilty by reason
of temporary insanity.

01:31.988 --> 01:33.947
Your father abused you,

01:33.947 --> 01:37.303
so we could go with the, uh,
Menendez brothers defense.

01:37.343 --> 01:38.500
They lost.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.820
But we didn't do it.
We didn't kill him.

01:40.860 --> 01:45.710
Sometimes it's not so much about the truth
as what the prosecution can prove.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.244
And in this case,

01:47.244 --> 01:53.374
it's Mr Crane's and my collective judgment
that they will be able to prove you guilty.

01:56.230 --> 01:58.372
Look, I don't care what they say.
I, I don't care what you say.

01:58.412 --> 02:00.646
We did not kill our father.

02:00.646 --> 02:02.348
And I'm not gonna stand up
in court and say that we did.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.437
It didn't happen.

02:05.597 --> 02:10.721
If we should lose,
and it's our belief we will,

02:10.721 --> 02:17.838
you both will spend the rest of your natural
lives in prison with no possibility of parole.

02:19.562 --> 02:21.923
We go to trial.

02:21.923 --> 02:25.443
Edward, is this what you want, as well?

02:27.829 --> 02:29.680
Yes.

02:30.569 --> 02:33.877
–Then we go to trial.
–Alan…

02:39.704 --> 02:42.753
It occurs to me that if we should lose,

02:42.753 --> 02:45.313
I will no longer be undefeated.

02:45.313 --> 02:46.712
Thank you, Denny.

02:46.712 --> 02:49.953
I can always count on you
to remind me of the bigger picture.

02:49.993 --> 02:52.347
And it's not so much
about their lives as…

02:52.387 --> 02:54.372
My legacy.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2007/05/29

03:24.470 --> 03:27.081
We're now being told the trial
will not start this morning.

03:27.121 --> 03:30.502
Instead, the defense has brought
a last-minute motion to suppress evidence,

03:30.542 --> 03:33.754
allegedly a doctor's report concerning.

03:34.031 --> 03:36.191
Please excuse us.
I have no comment.

03:36.231 --> 03:37.877
I have a comment.

03:37.877 --> 03:40.684
Check out my web site,
dennycranelaw.com.

03:40.684 --> 03:44.284
I also have a blog on MySpace.
Tell your daughters!

03:44.512 --> 03:48.309
It's doctor-patient privilege,
anything these boys said to a therapist.

03:48.349 --> 03:51.333
If a doctor fears imminent bodily harm,
he can break privilege.

03:51.373 --> 03:53.266
Yes, to prevent that bodily harm,

03:53.306 --> 03:55.500
but the exception was
never meant to allow

03:55.540 --> 04:00.540
privileged communications to be introduced
in a court of law as evidence against the patient.

04:00.580 --> 04:03.054
Mr Shore, everything in this report,

04:03.054 --> 04:05.475
I mean, the boys fantasizing
about killing their father,

04:05.515 --> 04:07.721
they've got a slew of other witnesses
to offer the same thing.

04:07.761 --> 04:09.396
What is so prejudicial about this—

04:09.436 --> 04:12.953
Because people tend to automatically
believe what doctors say.

04:12.993 --> 04:18.911
How else do you explain 50 million
Americans taking needless medications?

04:19.861 --> 04:22.209
No, I'm going to allow the testimony.

04:22.249 --> 04:25.384
Ask that your honor recuse herself.

04:25.384 --> 04:28.629
–Excuse me?
–Bad judging.

04:28.629 --> 04:33.359
I will see you and Mr Crane
in my chambers, please.

04:33.574 --> 04:37.900
Okay, first, I will not let you turn
this proceeding into a joke.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.403
But, your honor, Denny and I
are a comedy team.

04:40.443 --> 04:44.536
Second, I think that I had better
appoint another lawyer to co-counsel.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.229
This is a murder trial. I think the boys
should have separate attorneys.

04:47.269 --> 04:49.195
We've covered this.
I have Michael.

04:49.235 --> 04:50.989
Denny has Edward.
–No, it's the same firm.

04:51.029 --> 04:54.257
That's not co-counseling.
You're not at arm's length.

04:54.297 --> 04:56.654
Our defense is in concert.

04:56.654 --> 04:58.842
I want him off.

04:58.842 --> 05:01.325
–Why?
–Because this is a homicide.

05:01.325 --> 05:06.592
And I have a duty to ensure
competent counsel for both defendants.

05:06.592 --> 05:07.788
Do you know who I am?

05:07.828 --> 05:12.118
Yes, I do.
You used to be Denny Crane.

05:12.118 --> 05:15.715
I will completely vouch for
my co-counsel's trial skills.

05:15.755 --> 05:17.001
Well, you would have to, wouldn't you?

05:17.041 --> 05:19.635
Otherwise, your next sleepover
might get awkward.

05:19.675 --> 05:20.735
I can do this case.

05:20.775 --> 05:23.741
I am not gonna have you throwing up
inadequate counsel appeals—

05:23.781 --> 05:25.786
That's not gonna happen!

05:26.837 --> 05:28.946
Could I have a second alone, Denny?

05:28.986 --> 05:31.840
–With me?
–With the judge.

05:43.215 --> 05:44.616
That was uncalled for.

05:44.656 --> 05:46.401
Well, this isn't fun and games.

05:46.441 --> 05:51.505
Both defendants will be fairly
and adequately represented.

05:53.564 --> 05:55.470
They'd better be.

06:01.182 --> 06:04.042
For the record,
I was sexually attracted to you.

06:04.082 --> 06:06.700
Now, not so much.

06:18.388 --> 06:20.524
There's a smile!

06:20.524 --> 06:23.276
She is absolutely precious.

06:23.276 --> 06:26.653
And cute.
Are you sure she's yours?

06:26.653 --> 06:28.562
–How's Denise?
–She's doing great.

06:28.602 --> 06:31.646
Wow, it's amazing,
I mean, when you think about it.

06:31.686 --> 06:34.276
We've got laws legislating
everything in this country,

06:34.316 --> 06:36.206
and yet, they'll let you parent.

06:36.246 --> 06:38.006
Keep trying, Claire.

06:43.546 --> 06:45.071
Ready?

06:45.720 --> 06:47.696
Denny, there's no time for this.

06:47.736 --> 06:49.912
Is that what the outside world
thinks of me?

06:49.952 --> 06:52.543
That was one very misguided
judge's impression,

06:52.583 --> 06:54.021
and if you want to set her straight,

06:54.061 --> 06:56.769
more importantly, if you want
to save those boys,

06:56.809 --> 06:58.342
and certainly much more
important than that,

06:58.382 --> 07:02.507
if you want to safeguard your legacy,
you need to go try the case of your life,

07:02.547 --> 07:06.203
which will never happen with
you feeling sorry for yourself!

07:06.243 --> 07:08.501
What's your name?

07:10.523 --> 07:13.105
–Denny Crane.
–Who are you?

07:14.563 --> 07:16.977
–Denny Crane.
–Let's go.

07:16.977 --> 07:18.834
Damn right!

07:19.728 --> 07:21.252
Denny…

07:24.472 --> 07:26.538
Gas.

07:26.538 --> 07:28.700
They were pinching me.

07:32.764 --> 07:36.114
I really, really, really
appreciate you taking this time.

07:36.154 --> 07:40.372
No big deal. I really, really, really
do this for a living.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.101
How can I help ya?

07:42.101 --> 07:45.450
Well, um, recently I,
I went to Las Vegas—

07:45.450 --> 07:49.432
Vegas! Love it!
Sin city, my second home.

07:49.432 --> 07:51.609
Yes. Well, I…

07:51.609 --> 07:56.775
I lost a lot of money there,
$80,000 to be exact.

07:56.775 --> 07:58.647
I have a gambling problem.

07:58.647 --> 08:01.845
I'd say so.
The problem is you stink at it.

08:01.845 --> 08:06.039
I'd really appreciate it
if you wouldn't be flip about this.

08:06.039 --> 08:08.679
I want to sue the casino.

08:09.384 --> 08:14.527
No, now gambling is a disease,
and the casinos cultivate it.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.382
They gave me a line of credit.

08:17.382 --> 08:20.217
I don't even have $80,000
for God's sakes.

08:20.217 --> 08:22.247
Hey, you win some, you lose some.

08:22.287 --> 08:23.853
Stop it!

08:30.074 --> 08:32.346
I'm very sorry.

08:32.346 --> 08:36.222
When I meet people
for the very first time,

08:36.222 --> 08:39.671
I'm not quite myself.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.291
I want to sue.

08:44.029 --> 08:47.551
They, they destroyed me.

08:57.032 --> 09:00.447
The barrel point of the gun was flush
against the forehead and straight.

09:00.487 --> 09:02.600
From that, we concluded
it wasn't suicide.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.827
Why, doctor?

09:03.827 --> 09:05.786
Well, the victim had arms
shorter than mine,

09:05.826 --> 09:10.570
and as you can see,
in order to get a flush, straight entry,

09:10.570 --> 09:13.843
I would have to hold the gun
in an extremely awkward manner.

09:13.883 --> 09:16.922
It's more likely
he would hold it like this.

09:17.970 --> 09:20.738
What if he held it with two hands?

09:20.738 --> 09:23.545
Then he would have had to use
a thumb to squeeze the trigger.

09:23.585 --> 09:25.073
A print of the index finger was…

09:25.113 --> 09:27.887
What if Mr Scanlon wanted to
make it look like murder?

09:27.927 --> 09:31.168
Wouldn't he assume
the more awkward position?

09:31.168 --> 09:35.126
Maybe, but with shorter arms,
a straight entry would be very difficult.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.861
This man had beaten
his sons and his wife.

09:37.901 --> 09:39.468
–Objection.
–Allegedly so.

09:39.508 --> 09:42.193
Suppose out of hatred,
he wanted to frame them,

09:42.233 --> 09:45.909
or out of guilt, he didn't want
his life insurance policy to be voided,

09:45.949 --> 09:47.714
which suicide would definitely—

09:47.754 --> 09:50.329
–Objection. Speculation.
–Sustained.

09:50.329 --> 09:52.328
This is a coroner, Mr Shore.

09:52.328 --> 09:54.675
Let's keep our questions
medically based.

09:54.715 --> 09:59.701
You cannot exclude suicide
to a medical certainty, can you, doctor?

10:02.809 --> 10:04.381
No.

10:17.893 --> 10:19.780
Clarence.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.360
Hello.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.763
Is Alan in?

10:22.763 --> 10:25.658
–Uh, he's in court.
–Oh, dear.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.440
Is something wrong?

10:27.440 --> 10:29.503
I have a client who lost
a lot of money gambling.

10:29.543 --> 10:31.939
I took the case, though I seem
utterly without cause of action,

10:31.979 --> 10:34.313
and I'm just a little fraught.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.366
We have no defense,

10:40.406 --> 10:43.170
other than to put the boys up there
and let them proclaim their innocence.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.359
And you can put me up there.

10:44.399 --> 10:46.691
Yes, but you're their mother.

10:46.691 --> 10:50.998
Mrs Scanlon, if you really
want to help your sons here,

10:50.998 --> 10:56.446
our suggestion is that you convince them
to go with temporary insanity.

10:56.446 --> 10:58.381
I go with it all the time.

10:58.381 --> 10:59.544
But, but they didn't do it.

10:59.584 --> 11:02.457
The idea that your husband
killed himself…

11:02.457 --> 11:03.750
the angle of the wound—

11:03.790 --> 11:05.721
But it's possible.
You got them to admit that.

11:05.761 --> 11:07.292
Yes, yes, but—

11:07.292 --> 11:09.066
They can't prove that
somebody else didn't do it.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.138
There were so many people
who hated him.

11:11.178 --> 11:16.122
There is no physical, testimonial
or circumstantial evidence

11:16.122 --> 11:18.588
of anybody else being inside that house.

11:18.628 --> 11:23.509
What if I said I arrived home with them?

11:23.509 --> 11:25.995
You already told the police
that you were at the dentist.

11:26.035 --> 11:29.307
Well, maybe I lied to the police
to throw them off track.

11:29.347 --> 11:31.259
Why would you want to throw
the police off track

11:31.299 --> 11:33.039
if you thought your sons were innocent?

11:33.079 --> 11:35.065
Maybe I thought that the police
were gonna arrest them anyway,

11:35.105 --> 11:37.328
and a mother has to do what she
has to to save her children,

11:37.368 --> 11:39.932
and in this case,
it meant lying to the police.

11:39.972 --> 11:43.479
Is that so preposterous?
–No.

11:43.917 --> 11:48.097
But your dentist will testify
that you were at his office.

11:49.311 --> 11:53.611
Look, a mother knows.

11:53.611 --> 11:58.775
And my sons did not do this.
I mean, nobody witnessed this.

11:58.775 --> 12:01.309
Don't tell me you can't
establish some doubt.

12:01.349 --> 12:02.874
It has to be reasonable doubt.

12:02.914 --> 12:03.971
No, it just has to be doubt.

12:04.011 --> 12:05.882
It's your job to make it sound reasonable!

12:05.922 --> 12:09.614
That's why I hired you.
You're supposed to be the best!

12:09.614 --> 12:13.800
And you, you're Denny Crane,
for God's sake.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.187
How can you give up?

12:15.187 --> 12:16.621
We're not giving up.

12:16.621 --> 12:20.487
We will win this trial, Dorothy.

12:20.883 --> 12:23.291
I guarantee it!

12:25.019 --> 12:26.758
Sorry.

12:30.611 --> 12:34.455
When we got to the house, he was
lying at the foot of the front stairwell.

12:34.495 --> 12:35.366
He was dead.

12:35.366 --> 12:38.218
Objection!
This man's not a doctor.

12:39.097 --> 12:41.841
Sit down, counsel.

12:42.693 --> 12:45.060
–Denny…
–Please continue.

12:45.060 --> 12:48.062
There appeared to be a single
bullet hole to the forehead.

12:48.102 --> 12:50.574
The defendants were
the only other people there.

12:50.614 --> 12:52.144
Could you describe their demeanor?

12:52.184 --> 12:53.990
Objection.
Is he a psychiatrist now?

12:54.030 --> 12:55.107
Overruled.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.414
Objection. Are you a judge?

12:56.454 --> 12:59.960
Mr Crane, take your seat now.

13:00.383 --> 13:02.144
Stop it.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.104
Did they say anything?

13:05.104 --> 13:08.638
They said they came home
and found their father dead.

13:08.638 --> 13:10.758
We proceeded to ask
them some other questions,

13:10.798 --> 13:14.125
at which point the defendant,
Michael Scanlon, asked for a lawyer.

13:14.165 --> 13:16.209
Did they place the 911 call?

13:16.209 --> 13:19.275
No, neighbor, who said he heard a shot.

13:19.275 --> 13:22.457
You talked to the boys' mother
when she arrived home?

13:22.497 --> 13:23.303
Yes.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.012
She told you her husband was involved

13:25.052 --> 13:28.807
in numerous questionable,
if not shady, business deals

13:28.807 --> 13:31.898
and that he'd actually received
death threats recently.

13:31.938 --> 13:35.113
We concluded she was
covering for her sons.

13:35.113 --> 13:36.974
You never checked any of this out?

13:37.014 --> 13:39.517
I didn't personally.
I'm sure it was ruled out.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.262
Because you people never get it wrong?

13:41.302 --> 13:42.935
–Objection.
–Withdrawn.

13:42.935 --> 13:47.638
A witness reported a blue car speeding away
shortly after the gunshots were heard.

13:47.678 --> 13:50.882
Speeding down the street,
not necessarily from the house.

13:50.922 --> 13:53.069
But it could have been from the house?
You can't rule that out?

13:53.109 --> 13:55.381
We never located the car or driver, so—

13:55.421 --> 13:57.696
You can't rule it out?

13:58.138 --> 14:00.699
I suppose not.

14:02.622 --> 14:06.680
You can't sue a casino
for a gambler losing money.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.808
Well, we sort of did.

14:08.808 --> 14:09.725
What?

14:09.725 --> 14:13.730
If, if they're sending somebody,
they must be willing, on some level, to settle.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.687
First of all, you're not a lawyer here.
You're an assistant.

14:17.727 --> 14:18.885
And you,

14:18.885 --> 14:23.245
certainly you have enough experience
to recognize a legitimate cause of action.

14:23.285 --> 14:24.797
We'll try to settle it quickly.

14:24.837 --> 14:31.514
If they offer you so much
as an Indian-head nickel, you take it.

14:32.347 --> 14:34.575
Jerry, how could you
possibly take this case?

14:34.615 --> 14:38.713
She was an extremely nice lady.

14:39.084 --> 14:41.271
I didn't meet her.

14:50.335 --> 14:52.936
Why do you get to
cross-examine everyone?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.829
Your turn is coming up soon, Denny.

14:54.869 --> 14:57.812
–I'm not here to spectate, you know.
–I understand that,

14:57.852 --> 15:01.196
but as much as everything is
about you and your legacy,

15:01.236 --> 15:03.625
we also have two boys
whose lives are at stake.

15:03.665 --> 15:06.308
–So better to let you do it all?
–No, that's not—

15:06.348 --> 15:09.682
You know, last week, when Shirley was
so upset about me killing the duck,

15:09.722 --> 15:13.806
and we talked about how my silliness is
more about getting attention

15:13.846 --> 15:19.257
to distract me from what I've become.

15:19.257 --> 15:21.960
You talked about that with Shirley?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.335
Yeah.

15:23.335 --> 15:25.954
Why didn't you talk about that with me?

15:25.954 --> 15:28.147
I don't know.

15:28.683 --> 15:31.623
So you're running around sharing
your feelings with others now?

15:31.663 --> 15:34.384
I'm not running around.
She came into my office.

15:34.424 --> 15:36.947
And you felt compelled
to open up to her.

15:36.987 --> 15:41.363
Look, I thought if I were vulnerable,
she'd have sex with me.

15:41.363 --> 15:44.271
I don't have that agenda with you.

15:45.363 --> 15:46.415
Fine.

15:46.415 --> 15:49.462
Oh, Alan, for God's sakes…

15:49.462 --> 15:53.257
Alan, this came for you
special delivery, marked “personal.”

15:53.297 --> 15:55.107
Thank you.

15:55.107 --> 15:59.183
Uh, do you know anything
about the gaming industry?

15:59.183 --> 16:01.730
I have a case against a casino.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.673
Well, I know a fetching young woman

16:03.713 --> 16:08.215
who used to concierge for some of
the Russian high rollers.

16:08.215 --> 16:12.505
She knows all the casinos' little secrets.
I'll get her number for you.

16:12.545 --> 16:14.230
Thank you.

16:17.364 --> 16:19.993
–What the hell is this?
–What?

16:19.993 --> 16:21.726
Nothing on it.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.695
Oh, my God.

16:23.695 --> 16:26.357
What? What is it?

16:26.357 --> 16:27.773
A used condom.

16:27.773 --> 16:28.908
What?

16:29.412 --> 16:30.537
Not mine.

16:30.537 --> 16:34.183
Why would somebody send me
a used condom?

16:37.512 --> 16:41.149
The stationery's watermarked.

16:41.149 --> 16:47.322
It's got that medical insignia on it,
the staff with the snake.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.989
Sometimes it's nothing more than fantasy.

17:05.029 --> 17:08.269
As a therapist, you try and develop
a feel for distinguishing.

17:08.309 --> 17:11.148
In this case, the threat
seemed real, doctor?

17:11.189 --> 17:15.334
Well, the hatred that both of them exhibited
for their father was so profound,

17:15.374 --> 17:18.935
especially Edward's, and they
were suddenly talking about an end date.

17:18.974 --> 17:20.685
–An end date?
–Yes.

17:20.685 --> 17:25.296
Both of them separately had made comments
about “soon it will be over.”

17:25.336 --> 17:29.261
That's a very different thing from
“one day I'll run over him with a pickup truck.”

17:29.301 --> 17:31.777
If it was just idle fantasy,

17:31.777 --> 17:35.310
and it turns out my clients had no real
intention of killing their father,

17:35.350 --> 17:36.637
would that shock you?

17:36.677 --> 17:38.590
Shock me? No.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.857
But the coincidence might shock me.

17:40.897 --> 17:44.969
Here I've got two patients who I'm fairly
certain are gonna kill their father.

17:45.009 --> 17:47.419
The father ends up shot in the head.

17:47.419 --> 17:48.423
If they didn't do it,

17:48.463 --> 17:52.052
the coincidence is kind of shocking,
don't you think?

17:53.973 --> 17:55.953
Smart boys?

17:56.290 --> 17:57.207
Excuse me?

17:57.207 --> 18:00.204
Do these boys strike you as intelligent?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.706
Actually, very intelligent.

18:01.746 --> 18:04.051
Do they seem like they want to spend
the rest of their lives in prison?

18:04.091 --> 18:05.054
No.

18:05.054 --> 18:09.821
So if they really did plan
to murder their father,

18:09.821 --> 18:15.619
does it make sense that they would say that,
not only to you, but to others?

18:17.708 --> 18:20.643
No, it doesn't make any sense.

18:24.723 --> 18:27.939
dennycranelaw.com.
Pictures, bios, hobbies.

18:27.939 --> 18:32.591
I once captained my own spaceship,
multitalented.

18:34.954 --> 18:36.435
Denny, that was something!

18:36.475 --> 18:39.775
I felt. I actually had
a little moment in there.

18:39.775 --> 18:41.040
I'm not surprised.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.956
A great cross is like sex, man.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.397
Did we hear from the lab?
–Not yet.

18:46.397 --> 18:50.159
–Do we know who sent it?
–I'm getting a pretty good idea.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.898
Welcome to our conference room.

18:55.898 --> 19:01.055
This is attorney Jerry Espenson,
and this is the plaintiff Alisa McKenzie.

19:01.055 --> 19:02.382
Hello.

19:02.382 --> 19:04.730
Uh, thank you again
for agreeing to meet us,

19:04.770 --> 19:06.715
and welcome to our conference room.

19:06.755 --> 19:08.344
You're too nervous.

19:10.860 --> 19:13.277
Uh, please, sit.

19:14.899 --> 19:18.692
Well, I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but you have no claim here whatsoever.

19:18.732 --> 19:20.808
Yes, well, we believe we do.

19:20.808 --> 19:23.288
Your client took all her money.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.272
Yes, casinos like to do that.

19:25.272 --> 19:28.352
You really think that's fair?

19:28.823 --> 19:31.538
Do I think it's fair?

19:33.471 --> 19:36.924
Okay, Ralph Peters put you
up to this, didn't he?

19:36.924 --> 19:38.868
I should have known.
This is a big joke, right?

19:38.908 --> 19:43.257
It's not a joke!
My client lost all her virginity.

19:43.519 --> 19:45.126
Money!

19:45.126 --> 19:46.915
What is this?

19:46.915 --> 19:51.392
This is a lawsuit,
and your client is the defendant, sir.

19:51.392 --> 19:55.946
Well, you tell Ralph that was very funny.
I don't have time for this.

20:01.365 --> 20:03.504
Maybe you didn't welcome him
to the conference room enough.

20:03.544 --> 20:06.075
Oh, you were great.
“She lost all her virginity.”

20:06.115 --> 20:08.345
I'm surprised when he sat,
you didn't welcome him to the chair.

20:08.385 --> 20:10.715
If I had, he wouldn't have heard
over all your purring.

20:10.755 --> 20:12.885
Oh, I purred twice.

20:12.885 --> 20:14.428
So?

20:14.428 --> 20:16.800
We opened a dialogue.
We think we'll get something.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.979
As much as an Indian-head nickel?

20:19.979 --> 20:22.981
I'm not happy with either one of you.

20:24.541 --> 20:27.855
You need to go back to the fake cigarette,
toothpick thingie or the pipe.

20:27.895 --> 20:30.205
Yeah, and maybe you could
dress up as a talk show host!

20:30.245 --> 20:32.396
That might scare him!

20:33.543 --> 20:35.626
Sorry.

20:35.871 --> 20:39.935
We're looking foolish
in the eyes of a very senior partner.

20:39.935 --> 20:42.985
Let's make contact with
that friend of Alan's.

20:44.131 --> 20:47.710
He'd hit them, beat them.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.667
Did they ever fight back?

20:49.667 --> 20:53.570
Never. They never had
a violent reaction whatsoever.

20:53.570 --> 20:57.770
The idea that they could commit murder,
it, it's not in those boys.

20:57.810 --> 21:01.897
Did you love your late
husband, Mrs Scanlon?

21:02.463 --> 21:07.821
I suppose I must have to put up with…

21:07.821 --> 21:12.731
I, I also hated him.
–But you didn't kill him?

21:13.269 --> 21:16.063
Did the police ever question you?
–They did.

21:16.103 --> 21:19.789
But you were at your dentist's
at the time of the shooting.

21:19.829 --> 21:21.947
–Yes.
–We have your word on that,

21:21.987 --> 21:25.009
as well as your dentist's, I suppose.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.144
Uh, I guess so.

21:26.144 --> 21:27.946
What's your relationship with your dentist?

21:27.986 --> 21:30.511
Harold Prescott is his name, I believe?

21:30.551 --> 21:33.908
–Well, he's my dentist.
–Cleans teeth?

21:33.908 --> 21:38.852
The odd cavity, maybe a crown?
You two ever make love?

21:38.852 --> 21:39.658
Your honor…

21:39.658 --> 21:42.663
I'm assuming you have a good-faith basis
for that last one, counsel.

21:42.703 --> 21:43.940
I do, your honor.

21:43.940 --> 21:46.414
A little gift package arrived on my doorstep,

21:46.454 --> 21:49.170
sent to me by somebody who works
in a dentist's office.

21:49.210 --> 21:52.353
The package contained a condom,
a used one.

21:52.353 --> 21:57.623
The down-and-dirty DNA analysis,
I'm sure there's a pun in there somewhere,

21:57.623 --> 22:02.062
revealed traces of both you
and Dr Harold Prescott.

22:02.062 --> 22:05.790
It turns out he's your lover
and a rather nifty alibi

22:05.790 --> 22:08.818
should you want to say you were
somewhere else around the time

22:08.858 --> 22:13.905
that your late husband had
a bullet put in his head.

22:13.905 --> 22:17.770
Did you shoot your husband, Dorothy?

22:22.522 --> 22:25.914
I think I'd like to plead
the Fifth amendment.

22:25.914 --> 22:29.236
Funny, the dentist refused to
answer our questions, as well,

22:29.276 --> 22:34.418
though he did unwittingly provide us
with a lovely DNA sample, as did you, Dorothy.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.585
Did you kill your husband?

22:36.585 --> 22:39.583
I'm pleading the Fifth amendment.

22:56.108 --> 22:59.735
You love your sons very much,
don't you, Mrs Scanlon?

22:59.735 --> 23:02.117
I said I'm pleading the Fifth.

23:02.117 --> 23:03.504
Yeah.

23:03.504 --> 23:05.481
I'm not gonna incriminate you, ma'am.

23:05.521 --> 23:09.627
You see, we also got a little surprise
package delivered to our office,

23:09.667 --> 23:11.620
also a used condom.

23:11.620 --> 23:15.544
It seems someone is out to incriminate you,

23:15.544 --> 23:18.782
leaving open the question of
how would they get the condoms.

23:18.822 --> 23:23.686
Or maybe the dentist himself
wanted to turn you in.

23:23.686 --> 23:27.294
Or, maybe…

23:27.638 --> 23:30.715
you wanted to incriminate yourself.

23:30.715 --> 23:33.215
Can we call on Dr Prescott, please?

23:40.485 --> 23:43.206
I think you'll be happy to learn
that the doctor was willing to talk to us.

23:43.246 --> 23:45.305
Your honor, I don't know what's
going on, but certainly none of this—

23:45.345 --> 23:47.262
You opened the door on this, counsel.

23:47.302 --> 23:52.965
It seems you kind of threw
yourself at him 2 days ago.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.344
Before that, you two had
never gotten together.

23:55.384 --> 23:58.105
A desperate mom trying to collect
a little evidence to save your boys?

23:58.145 --> 23:58.947
Objection.

23:58.947 --> 24:01.521
Watermarked stationery,
you certainly drew us a neat path.

24:01.561 --> 24:03.914
–Objection!
–Overruled.

24:03.914 --> 24:07.087
We have the parking garage records
for the day your husband was killed.

24:07.127 --> 24:10.063
We can verify when you arrived
and when you left.

24:10.103 --> 24:12.869
We have several witnesses from
inside the doctor's office.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.059
You don't have to plead the Fifth, ma'am.

24:15.099 --> 24:17.496
We know you didn't kill your husband.

24:17.536 --> 24:23.619
Only thing you have to worry about
is maybe a little obstruction of justice.

24:23.619 --> 24:25.698
But nice try, mom.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.445
Oh, I should have known better.
It was all much too easy.

24:41.485 --> 24:44.061
Of course you wanted me
to accuse you on the stand.

24:44.101 --> 24:45.842
This was a stupid idea,

24:45.842 --> 24:48.741
made worse by the fact
that I didn't see through it.

24:48.781 --> 24:51.716
I should have gotten a continuance.
I knew I was being set up.

24:51.756 --> 24:54.671
How could I not have known
it was you?

24:55.824 --> 24:59.687
This is a horrendous setback.

25:00.474 --> 25:03.655
So what happens now?

25:06.792 --> 25:09.547
We put you up there to testify,

25:09.547 --> 25:15.626
which ordinarily would be
a bad idea, but…

25:16.355 --> 25:18.238
we're desperate.

25:18.238 --> 25:20.644
Do you agree, Denny?

25:23.743 --> 25:25.395
Denny?

25:41.782 --> 25:43.061
Who's she?

25:43.061 --> 25:45.951
She's wired into some of the casinos,
including the Botticelli.

25:45.991 --> 25:47.867
Alan put me in touch with her.

25:47.907 --> 25:49.358
Excuse me.

25:49.358 --> 25:51.180
Has she given you anything?

25:51.180 --> 25:54.579
We, we don't know yet.
It seems she only speaks Russian.

25:54.619 --> 25:55.980
Alan didn't tell us that.

25:56.020 --> 25:58.428
She knows everything
about how the casinos work.

25:58.468 --> 26:00.595
Ah, excellent.

26:00.595 --> 26:05.059
If only you could understand
a word she said.

26:07.922 --> 26:11.219
–Let's get a translator.
–That would be best.

26:21.162 --> 26:25.250
Michael and I were going
to the cape for the weekend.

26:25.250 --> 26:30.040
Uh, so we were outside
in the driveway packing up the car.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.810
Where was your father?

26:31.810 --> 26:33.325
Inside.

26:33.325 --> 26:37.871
He w— he got off work at noon,
so he was at home already, drinking.

26:37.871 --> 26:39.385
Was he home alone?

26:39.385 --> 26:40.791
We, uh, we assumed.

26:40.791 --> 26:42.788
I mean, we had just
gotten home ourselves,

26:42.828 --> 26:45.558
and our stuff was in the garage,
so we just started packing,

26:45.598 --> 26:50.122
and it's not like we were ever looking for
an excuse to go inside, so…

26:50.162 --> 26:54.955
But at some point, you did
go inside, didn't you, Edward?

26:56.677 --> 26:58.737
Yes.

27:00.331 --> 27:02.537
What did you find?

27:06.730 --> 27:11.857
I know this is difficult,
but you need to tell us what you saw.

27:11.857 --> 27:20.391
I saw my father on the floor with blood.

27:20.391 --> 27:23.366
What else?

27:23.366 --> 27:25.691
I…

27:26.615 --> 27:30.534
I saw Michael, uh, with the gun.

27:30.534 --> 27:33.111
–Objection!
–I'm sorry, Michael.

27:33.111 --> 27:36.054
–Your honor, approach.
–Let's go.

27:39.037 --> 27:40.806
–What the hell are you doing?
–It's every man for himself.

27:40.846 --> 27:43.555
I move for an immediate mistrial.
He's completely blindsided me.

27:43.595 --> 27:46.204
Hey, I specifically wanted
two different firms,

27:46.244 --> 27:48.698
but you assured me that you two
could work at arm's length.

27:48.738 --> 27:50.362
Because our defenses were in concert.
Now…

27:50.402 --> 27:52.595
That's the risk that you assumed,
against my advice.

27:52.635 --> 27:55.000
–This is a mistrial.
–No, you don't get a mistrial.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.147
You can cross-examine,
and your guy can tell his story,

27:57.187 --> 27:59.610
but this trial goes on.

27:59.610 --> 28:02.160
–You're making a big mistake.
–My duty is to my client.

28:02.200 --> 28:06.424
Then you shouldn't make an enemy of me.
Your client will suffer.

28:06.814 --> 28:08.078
Get out of my way.

28:08.078 --> 28:11.378
Evidently, I'm not giving
interviews at this time.

28:18.342 --> 28:20.109
How was I?

28:20.109 --> 28:21.625
Perfect.

28:21.884 --> 28:22.848
Now it's my turn.

28:22.888 --> 28:25.177
Now make sure when
Michael accuses Edward

28:25.217 --> 28:27.797
you go just as nuts as I did,
or the DA will figure this out.

28:27.837 --> 28:28.645
Got it.

28:28.645 --> 28:31.178
Denny, not too nuts.
Somewhere between anger and—

28:31.218 --> 28:33.098
Mad cow.

28:33.403 --> 28:36.068
Right in my wheelhouse, man.

28:39.388 --> 28:41.117
How did you persuade him to return?

28:41.157 --> 28:43.181
I just did. Have you got
the wooden cigarette?

28:43.221 --> 28:46.879
I'd rather not.
It's important I succeed being me.

28:47.153 --> 28:48.413
What's happening?

28:48.413 --> 28:50.075
The Russian woman gave us something.

28:50.115 --> 28:52.349
We have another settlement meeting
setup with the lawyer.

28:52.389 --> 28:53.704
Great. I'll be joining you.

28:53.744 --> 28:55.907
That won't be necessary.

28:55.907 --> 28:58.265
Oh, but it will.

29:00.325 --> 29:01.995
Now you told the police

29:01.995 --> 29:06.202
that neither you nor Edward had
anything to do with your father's death.

29:06.242 --> 29:06.862
That's right.

29:06.902 --> 29:10.213
And suddenly Edward gets up here
and says you did it.

29:10.253 --> 29:11.359
Yes.

29:11.359 --> 29:13.198
Did that come as a shock to you?

29:13.238 --> 29:15.013
–Well, not really.
–It didn't?

29:15.053 --> 29:16.658
Your own brother turning against you?

29:16.698 --> 29:20.357
Well, this morning I told Edward that
I wasn't gonna lie anymore,

29:20.397 --> 29:23.303
that I was gonna come clean,
I was gonna tell the truth, so…

29:23.343 --> 29:26.472
And what is the truth, Michael?

29:29.188 --> 29:32.835
Well, basically, it went down
exactly as Edward said,

29:32.835 --> 29:35.007
except I didn't shoot my dad.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.025
–Edward did.
–Oh, please!

29:37.025 --> 29:38.083
Mr Crane…

29:38.083 --> 29:39.459
–He's desperately trying to cast suspicion
on my client. –Mr Crane…

29:39.499 --> 29:41.141
You're the one who
resorted to desperation!

29:41.181 --> 29:42.418
Hey, both of you be quiet!

29:42.458 --> 29:44.021
This man is suborning perjury, your honor!

29:44.061 --> 29:48.212
Mr Crane, I will ask you
to take your seat now.

29:50.740 --> 29:53.826
I kind of figured, knowing Edward,
that he might try something like this.

29:53.866 --> 29:55.508
I guess since he was testifying first,

29:55.548 --> 29:59.094
he decided to fire kind of
a preemptive strike.

29:59.094 --> 30:06.119
Michael, the question becomes
“why did you cover for Edward?”

30:07.486 --> 30:10.188
Because our father was an awful person.

30:10.188 --> 30:14.050
He beat us both, and Edward…

30:14.050 --> 30:15.614
I know he did this for me, in a way.

30:15.654 --> 30:16.913
Move to strike.

30:16.913 --> 30:19.739
–On what grounds?
–He's lying!

30:33.555 --> 30:35.592
Look, I've made our position clear.

30:35.632 --> 30:39.996
It isn't gonna change because
you brought in Shirley Schmidt.

30:39.996 --> 30:43.753
Mr Weiner, the casinos
have it down to a science,

30:43.753 --> 30:45.714
how to manipulate the customers.

30:45.754 --> 30:47.671
You said you had something
you wanted me to hear.

30:47.711 --> 30:51.021
So far I haven't heard it,
and I'm becoming increasingly frustrated.

30:51.061 --> 30:53.007
Could you fill me in?

30:55.925 --> 30:58.841
What is that ridiculous sound
you keep making?

30:58.881 --> 31:01.327
–Mr Weiner…
–Are you two even real lawyers?

31:01.367 --> 31:04.093
Are you in this with Ralph Peters?
I'll kill him.

31:04.133 --> 31:05.575
This is a real lawsuit,

31:05.615 --> 31:07.909
and I would advise you
to take it very seriously.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.797
Oh, please.

31:10.636 --> 31:14.629
There are studies, sir, that link
your industry to high rates of divorce.

31:14.669 --> 31:18.453
Studies funded by anti-gaming lobbies.

31:20.552 --> 31:26.076
–This woman had no experience.
–This woman had luck, unfortunately, bad.

31:26.827 --> 31:32.026
30 million people will visit
Vegas casinos alone every year.

31:32.026 --> 31:35.788
–I would like to finish, please.
–I'm sorry. You're done.

31:36.079 --> 31:38.875
Hey, buddy, he didn't call you in
to say pretty please.

31:38.915 --> 31:42.213
Get your ass back in that chair.

31:42.213 --> 31:43.150
What?

31:43.150 --> 31:46.433
Your client gave Alisa McKenzie this,
a player's club card.

31:46.473 --> 31:47.579
You know what it is.

31:47.619 --> 31:50.304
It gives a gambler the sense
she's not spending money so much

31:50.344 --> 31:53.483
as earning bonus points
toward a free rib buffet.

31:53.523 --> 31:54.641
Gotta love it.

31:54.641 --> 31:56.588
You think a jury would look
favorably on an industry

31:56.628 --> 32:00.536
that privately refers to its slots as
the crack cocaine of gambling?

32:00.576 --> 32:02.987
Oh, yeah, sure, let's all cheer
for the good guys!

32:03.027 --> 32:04.859
Tell you what. Pick up your
phone, give your boss a call.

32:04.899 --> 32:08.012
Ask him about something
called enhanced air industries.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.140
You know what that is?

32:09.180 --> 32:10.932
Synthetic pheromones!

32:10.932 --> 32:13.643
It instills a sense of comfort and security.

32:13.683 --> 32:18.155
It's a synthetic version of the same pheromone
released from mothers to newborns.

32:18.195 --> 32:21.998
Some casinos, including the Botticelli,
pump it into their gaming rooms.

32:22.038 --> 32:24.022
Don't you just love that?

32:24.022 --> 32:28.107
It isn't enough you ply
your customers with free alcohol

32:28.107 --> 32:30.698
delivered by cleavage-bearing waitresses.

32:30.738 --> 32:33.991
It's not enough that gamblers sit
on ergonomically designed seats

32:34.031 --> 32:36.398
under lights specifically engineered
to keep them alert.

32:36.438 --> 32:39.007
It's not enough you give them
chips and betting cards

32:39.047 --> 32:41.926
so they don't have to touch
real cash as they incur real debt.

32:41.966 --> 32:44.701
You have to then gas them
with a synthetic pheromone

32:44.741 --> 32:46.788
designed to make them feel
happy and secure

32:46.828 --> 32:48.931
as they're losing money
they don't have!

32:48.971 --> 32:51.421
You have absolutely
no scientific proof of that.

32:51.461 --> 32:54.829
Think not? Well, discovery and experts
come with lawsuits, buddy.

32:54.869 --> 32:58.762
We can test the Botticelli air
as early as Friday.

32:59.457 --> 33:03.572
Give your boss a call, sport.
Just say “synthetic pheromones.”

33:03.572 --> 33:06.404
Let me know how he responds.

33:09.318 --> 33:11.647
I'm done being nice here.

33:11.647 --> 33:13.870
Pick up your phone.

33:27.822 --> 33:29.753
Michael was always the ringleader,

33:29.793 --> 33:31.793
always the one to take matters
into his own hands,

33:31.833 --> 33:33.595
and he's the one that did so here.

33:33.635 --> 33:37.552
The physical evidence backs up
everything that Edward said, everything.

33:37.592 --> 33:41.857
And did you check out
Michael's demeanor on the stand?

33:41.857 --> 33:44.237
Even, no emotion.

33:44.237 --> 33:47.845
His testimony was tailor-made,
crafted, calculated

33:47.845 --> 33:50.192
to counter what Edward said.

33:50.192 --> 33:52.747
The therapist Dr Levine said

33:52.747 --> 33:56.421
Edward's hatred for his father
was especially profound,

33:56.421 --> 33:58.210
and did you all happen to notice,

33:58.250 --> 34:01.179
as Michael addressed his younger brother
from the witness stand,

34:01.219 --> 34:04.783
Edward could not bring himself
to look at him.

34:04.783 --> 34:05.789
Perfect.

34:05.789 --> 34:09.166
Brother Ed says Mike did it.
Brother Mike says Ed did it,

34:09.206 --> 34:12.127
and you're left with
reasonable doubt for both.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.542
It's genius.

34:13.542 --> 34:17.484
If you go back into that room thinking,
“I wonder which one did it,”

34:17.524 --> 34:19.338
they both go free.

34:19.338 --> 34:21.137
That's their strategy.

34:21.137 --> 34:24.726
There certainly were others
who had motive to kill Joseph Scanlon.

34:24.766 --> 34:26.402
The police never investigated.

34:26.442 --> 34:29.023
A car was seen speeding
away from the scene.

34:29.063 --> 34:33.295
They never traced it.
They simply arrested the boys.

34:33.295 --> 34:36.505
'Cause it was such
a nice, neat, tidy package.

34:36.505 --> 34:38.914
Boys made the threats.
They were at the scene.

34:38.954 --> 34:40.655
Blood was on them, gun with them.

34:40.695 --> 34:42.579
Why bother to investigate?

34:42.579 --> 34:46.856
It saved a lot of time
to simply arrest the boys.

34:46.856 --> 34:48.994
And maybe the police got it half-right.

34:49.034 --> 34:50.559
Maybe Edward did it.

34:50.559 --> 34:52.597
If anybody, it was Michael!

34:52.597 --> 34:53.851
It was both,

34:53.851 --> 34:56.330
and they're both playing you for idiots.

34:56.370 --> 35:00.944
You can't know that it was
or wasn't just one of them.

35:00.944 --> 35:02.190
And not knowing which one…

35:02.230 --> 35:04.122
There's reasonable doubt for both.

35:04.162 --> 35:09.338
Therefore, under the law,
both must be set free.

35:09.338 --> 35:13.912
A man was found dead
with a bullet in his head.

35:13.912 --> 35:18.245
Discovered with the body were his two sons,
blood on their hands.

35:18.245 --> 35:22.169
The two people who said
they would kill him.

35:23.502 --> 35:25.794
Let's stop wasting time.

35:32.708 --> 35:36.789
Before I even slide this over,
it's nonnegotiable.

35:36.789 --> 35:39.319
Absolutely no admission of liability.

35:39.319 --> 35:42.147
If it gets out at all,
we'll revoke it.

35:42.147 --> 35:44.548
–What's the number?
–I'm not kidding.

35:44.588 --> 35:46.273
This is as high as I'm authorized.

35:46.313 --> 35:48.997
You either take it sealed,
or else we go to court.

35:49.037 --> 35:51.808
At which point, we'll
drag it out for light-years.

35:51.848 --> 35:53.992
The number?

36:17.791 --> 36:19.482
<i>225,000</i>

36:23.030 --> 36:27.304
We'll recommend it to our client,
and we'll let you know.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.367
Thank you.

36:32.529 --> 36:36.318
Well, very nice result, you guys.

36:36.318 --> 36:38.765
And quite a performance, Jer.

36:38.765 --> 36:39.909
Yes.

36:39.909 --> 36:41.124
Nice work, Clarence.

36:41.164 --> 36:42.674
You, too, Jer.

36:46.931 --> 36:48.491
Oh, God.

36:48.491 --> 36:51.029
–We did it!
–Yes, we did!

36:58.146 --> 37:00.106
They sued a casino.

37:01.911 --> 37:04.566
Well, I'm guessing it went well.

37:04.953 --> 37:07.140
That's your boyfriend in there.

37:07.140 --> 37:09.355
Does he hop like that with you?

37:22.292 --> 37:23.926
You okay?

37:26.296 --> 37:29.833
We could both win, both lose.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.040
One of us could win.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.654
The other might not.

37:35.218 --> 37:36.805
Yes, that's right.

37:36.805 --> 37:39.627
You closed better than I did.

37:39.912 --> 37:42.212
Your closing was fine.

37:46.190 --> 37:48.690
I don't think I could take
you winning and my losing.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.869
Is that a bad thing for me to say?

37:50.909 --> 37:53.353
It's honest.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.522
There's a saying,

37:56.522 --> 38:02.457
“success is never so sweet as when
accompanied by the failure of a friend.”

38:02.958 --> 38:08.043
Horrible saying.
Probably coined in Hollywood.

38:09.670 --> 38:12.331
I want us to win, too, Denny.

38:12.331 --> 38:16.497
I believe the boys are innocent.

38:16.920 --> 38:23.672
But I especially want us to win for you.

38:23.672 --> 38:28.055
Success could never be sweeter
than when shared with…

38:28.055 --> 38:30.673
A flamingo.

38:38.629 --> 38:46.097
You have no idea how desperate
I am not to be over.

38:46.097 --> 38:50.565
You think you do,
but you can't possibly know…

38:50.565 --> 38:53.255
until you're there.

38:56.065 --> 38:57.794
Jury's back.

38:59.950 --> 39:01.402
Ready?

39:01.402 --> 39:02.569
Ready.

39:02.569 --> 39:03.739
Pants?

39:03.739 --> 39:05.239
They're on.

39:07.293 --> 39:09.934
The defendants will please rise.

39:10.144 --> 39:13.220
Madam Foreperson, the jury
has reached a unanimous verdict?

39:13.260 --> 39:15.032
We have, your honor.

39:15.304 --> 39:16.702
What say you?

39:16.702 --> 39:21.677
32666, the commonwealth of Massachusetts
vs Michael Scanlon

39:21.677 --> 39:24.209
in the count of murder
in the first degree.

39:24.249 --> 39:29.010
We the jury find the defendant
Michael Scanlon…

39:29.651 --> 39:31.465
not guilty.

39:31.465 --> 39:36.353
32667, commonwealth of Massachusetts
vs Edward Scanlon

39:36.353 --> 39:39.452
on the charge of murder
in the first degree.

39:39.452 --> 39:44.501
We the jury find the defendant
Edward Scanlon…

39:44.501 --> 39:46.665
not guilty.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.064
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
thank you for your service.

39:50.104 --> 39:52.228
You are dismissed.

39:53.016 --> 39:56.662
–We both won.
–We both won.

39:57.017 --> 39:58.569
Still undefeated.

39:58.569 --> 40:01.246
The legend lives on.

40:03.529 --> 40:05.918
Hey, it worked out for you, too.
Never in doubt.

40:05.958 --> 40:07.929
Didn't I guarantee it?

40:08.737 --> 40:10.491
Denny Crane.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.868
I'm so good,
even I don't believe it.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.674
The trial of the century.

40:27.941 --> 40:29.406
And we won.

40:29.406 --> 40:31.270
Together.

40:31.270 --> 40:32.930
You won that trial, Denny.

40:32.970 --> 40:36.485
It was your idea for them to accuse
each other, very risky, but…

40:36.525 --> 40:40.749
It took someone with Denny Crane-sized
balls to come up with it.

40:44.739 --> 40:47.439
Does it bother you
that we suborned perjury?

40:47.479 --> 40:49.410
Not a bit. You?

40:49.410 --> 40:52.456
Not really.
I believe they're innocent.

40:54.675 --> 40:56.283
Sleepover tonight?

40:56.283 --> 40:58.212
You got it.

41:00.407 --> 41:03.626
How did the judge know about
our sleepovers, anyway?

41:03.666 --> 41:05.864
Who knows?

41:06.633 --> 41:12.465
Is it odd that two grown heteros
have sleepovers?

41:12.465 --> 41:16.383
Who cares?
I wouldn't trade them for anything.

41:17.505 --> 41:18.724
To next season, my friend.

41:18.764 --> 41:20.574
I can't wait to see what we do next.

41:20.614 --> 41:22.276
I'm just getting started.

41:22.276 --> 41:23.481
Denny Crane.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.523
Alan Shore.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.259
Flamingoes.

41:26.259 --> 41:27.496
Till death do us part.

41:27.536 --> 41:30.724
Let no man tear asunder.
