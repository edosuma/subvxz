Kirsten: <i>It's foggy.</i>

00:02.275 --> 00:03.897
Ayo: <i>Her oxytocin levels are rising</i>

00:03.922 --> 00:05.443
<i>in response to what she's
seeing in the stitch.</i>

00:05.468 --> 00:07.195
Camille: <i>What was up with
you in the lab yesterday,</i>

00:07.220 --> 00:08.430
<i>your hands were shakin' pretty good.</i>

00:08.455 --> 00:09.828
I'm just trying to be a good scientist.

00:09.853 --> 00:12.297
Good scientist or worried boyfriend?

00:12.322 --> 00:14.761
- I'm looking for the M.E.
- Amanda Weston.

00:14.786 --> 00:16.273
You fully coulda told
me that on the phone.

00:16.297 --> 00:18.824
I know. But then you wouldn't be
here drinking whiskey with me.

00:18.849 --> 00:21.148
I don't know.
It takes me a minute to trust people.

00:21.173 --> 00:23.476
Everyone deserves to be
trusted until proven otherwise.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.668
What are you doin' later,
do you wanna hang out, maybe?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.398
It is a rolling cipher!

00:27.955 --> 00:29.670
- Ha! We did it!
- You did it!

00:29.695 --> 00:31.258
Linus: <i>You really have a super power.</i>

00:31.283 --> 00:33.566
Everyone deserves to be
trusted until proven otherwise?

00:33.591 --> 00:36.297
I need to appoint someone to
take on my responsibilities

00:36.322 --> 00:38.859
in the lab, and the only
person that I think is capable

00:38.884 --> 00:39.828
is Cameron.

00:39.853 --> 00:42.125
- Why Cameron?
- "Everyone deserves to be trusted"?

00:42.150 --> 00:45.100
That is a bad policy.

- What?

00:59.589 --> 01:02.056
- Maggie's chair.
- Oh. I know.

01:02.081 --> 01:04.284
I'm just used to seeing
her in the chair.

01:04.309 --> 01:06.376
Sitting. Glaring.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.801
Come here.

01:08.826 --> 01:10.492
(exhales)

01:14.816 --> 01:17.160
- Ooh.
- How's it feel?

01:17.184 --> 01:18.432
- Oh, this is nice.
- (laughs)

01:18.457 --> 01:20.434
Oh, yeah, it's got that back support.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.645
- Oh...
- (laughs)

01:22.670 --> 01:24.737
Ahh. Oh gosh, I could get used to this.

01:24.762 --> 01:27.477
Oh, yeah? Well, let me see.

01:30.608 --> 01:34.842
Mm... yeah, you're right,
it's very comfortable.

01:41.457 --> 01:44.458
Hey, I wanted to thank you
for taking me to your mom.

01:44.483 --> 01:45.616
You didn't have to.

01:45.651 --> 01:48.419
I know, but I'm glad I did.

01:48.454 --> 01:52.623
I just... I didn't... I didn't feel
right about keeping that from you.

01:52.658 --> 01:54.491
- And also...
- What?

01:54.527 --> 01:57.379
It kinda felt like I was taking
you to meet her for the first time.

01:57.404 --> 01:58.652
No, I liked meeting her.

01:58.677 --> 01:59.840
She's a good listener.

02:01.253 --> 02:03.676
- What, too soon?
- Yeah, a little.

02:04.754 --> 02:07.425
- Oh, you wanna get some coffee?
- Sure. Always.

02:07.450 --> 02:08.716
I know where Maggie
keeps her secret stash.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.107
Really?

02:10.740 --> 02:12.215
I'm coming.

- God,

02:53.116 --> 02:55.266
please text more quietly.

02:55.291 --> 02:56.166
What's with you?

02:56.190 --> 02:56.784
Number one, nothing,

02:56.809 --> 02:58.742
number two, stop shouting.

02:59.260 --> 03:00.649
Mm. There you are.

03:00.674 --> 03:01.673
Where were you last night?

03:01.708 --> 03:02.774
Out.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.810
Well, you look like hell.

03:04.845 --> 03:08.721
Well, your voice is like
fingernails made of broken glass

03:08.746 --> 03:11.338
dragging across a blackboard
made of more broken glass.

03:11.363 --> 03:12.728
- Mmm.
- She's hungover.

03:12.753 --> 03:14.419
I resent the implication.

03:15.656 --> 03:17.361
You texting Ivy?

03:18.077 --> 03:22.588
Ivy? Ohh, did I know
you guys were a thing?

03:22.613 --> 03:24.260
Uh, we're just texting.

03:24.285 --> 03:26.842
Awesome. Let me see that real quick.

03:26.867 --> 03:30.356
- "Hey, Ivy, Camille here."
- (texting)

03:30.381 --> 03:35.717
"Just wanted to let you know
that Maggie bitch-slapped me

03:35.742 --> 03:39.334
for saying I trusted you."

03:39.359 --> 03:41.058
Thanks!

03:42.261 --> 03:44.361
Good. You're just kidding.

03:44.386 --> 03:47.020
Just about the text. Please tell me

03:47.045 --> 03:50.029
I didn't violate my own
judgment and lose a potentially

03:50.054 --> 03:52.087
career-changing promotion

03:52.112 --> 03:54.431
just so you could date the new brunette?

03:54.456 --> 03:56.255
That's not okay.

03:57.392 --> 03:59.459
We're not okay.

03:59.494 --> 04:00.632
(clears throat)

04:00.657 --> 04:01.991
Cameron: Just got the call.

04:02.017 --> 04:04.117
New case. Victim's
name is "Mark Broden."

04:04.142 --> 04:06.043
Camille?

04:07.277 --> 04:09.617
Don't look at me. I didn't kill him.

04:10.398 --> 04:11.463
Well, I know, but this is the time

04:11.499 --> 04:12.390
where you do that thing with the thing,

04:12.415 --> 04:14.098
you know, you...
you run down the case for us.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.631
You mean, when Maggie's in charge,

04:15.656 --> 04:17.661
and she gives me the
case file ahead of time,

04:17.687 --> 04:18.952
so I have a chance to review it

04:18.978 --> 04:20.444
and prepare first?

04:20.661 --> 04:23.374
So... sucks to be you.

04:23.399 --> 04:25.003
(clears throat)

04:26.710 --> 04:27.943
Fine.

04:27.978 --> 04:31.599
Uh, here's what we know about, uh...
Mr. Broden.

04:31.624 --> 04:34.123
He is 43.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.562
Dead.

04:35.587 --> 04:37.007
Obviously.

04:37.016 --> 04:39.484
Uh, there's a, uh, there's a picture

04:39.509 --> 04:41.328
- here...
- Are you connected to the system?

04:41.353 --> 04:43.210
Yes!

04:46.094 --> 04:48.022
Camille: Hm. Mm.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.812
Well, he's a handsome, sideways fellow.

04:49.837 --> 04:51.213
Yeah, moment.

04:55.202 --> 04:57.639
Oh, God. Give me that.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.819
Do I have to do everything around here?

04:59.844 --> 05:02.390
Sit down, before you break something.

05:02.476 --> 05:06.187
(sighs) Broden. Ehh, shot to death.

05:06.212 --> 05:08.518
In his Beverly Hills penthouse.

05:08.543 --> 05:10.015
Most likely in his sleep.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.403
No sign of struggle.

05:11.428 --> 05:12.906
No sign of forced entry.

05:12.931 --> 05:14.998
The cops came when he
didn't show up for work

05:15.023 --> 05:16.756
or answer his cell.

05:16.781 --> 05:19.476
- What did he do?
- Divorce lawyer who was...

05:19.501 --> 05:21.743
Heh, hashtag irony,
was in the middle of his own divorce

05:21.768 --> 05:24.748
from Barbara Broden, fashion model.

05:24.773 --> 05:28.710
So the ex was a suspect.
Anyone else want him dead?

05:28.735 --> 05:31.187
Only about half the people
on the cases he handled.

05:31.212 --> 05:34.281
Hm. Looks like he represented a
lot of high-powered politicians,

05:34.306 --> 05:37.734
so we should consider that his death
might've been politically motivated.

05:43.664 --> 05:46.296
So, is that it, or...?

05:46.507 --> 05:52.554
Considering the three seconds you
gave me to prepare? Yes... boss.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.776
Uh, okay,
I think we should get ready to stitch.

05:56.801 --> 05:59.802
Let's make this a
quiet stitch, shall we?

06:02.844 --> 06:05.256
Hey. Thanks for making me
look like an idiot in there.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.906
Oh... you didn't need me for that.

06:08.931 --> 06:10.445
Look, I didn't ask Maggie for this,
all right?

06:10.470 --> 06:13.748
I know you want the job,
but you didn't get it. So let it go.

06:13.772 --> 06:15.992
And then maybe you and I could
work together and figure out

06:16.017 --> 06:18.383
whoever killed this guy... okay?

06:18.408 --> 06:21.789
Whoo. Nice speech. Am I dismissed?

06:24.367 --> 06:26.017
Mm.

06:36.364 --> 06:39.145
- Hey.
- Uh, please don't tell me

06:39.170 --> 06:40.185
you're worried about me stitching.

06:40.210 --> 06:42.168
There are things that've been
happening in the stitches

06:42.193 --> 06:43.981
that, yes, worry me.

06:44.006 --> 06:46.661
Can you just... go play with your mice.

06:46.686 --> 06:47.607
Let me do what I do.

06:47.632 --> 06:48.782
Hey!

06:51.442 --> 06:53.242
Look, regardless of
us, I'm in charge here,

06:53.267 --> 06:55.656
so I don't like what I see,
I'm gonna call the bounce.

07:01.693 --> 07:05.204
(quietly) I could use some support
right now, okay? Not attitude.

07:10.613 --> 07:12.380
Cameron: Lights to 20 percent, please.

07:12.405 --> 07:15.185
I need a go, no-go for
stitch neurosync. Life-Sci?

07:15.210 --> 07:16.295
- Go.
- Sub-Bio?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.208
- Go.
- Engineering?

07:17.233 --> 07:18.277
- Go.
- Communications?

07:18.302 --> 07:19.443
- Go.
- Medical?

07:19.468 --> 07:21.473
- Go.
- Com check, one two, one two.

07:21.498 --> 07:23.248
A full and supportive go.

07:23.273 --> 07:25.396
And... I'm sorry about before.

07:25.421 --> 07:26.988
Thanks for that.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.177
All right, let's button this
up like a Hollywood pre-nup.

07:29.202 --> 07:31.021
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

07:31.046 --> 07:34.127
In three, two, one, mark!

07:34.697 --> 07:36.754
How long have you been
screwing her for, Mark?

07:36.779 --> 07:39.162
- It's not like that.
- Don't you lie to me!

07:39.187 --> 07:41.660
Kirsten: I'm in Broden's apartment.
He and his wife are arguing,

07:41.685 --> 07:43.318
she's accusing him of having an affair.

07:43.343 --> 07:44.726
How long have you been
screwing her for, Mark?

07:44.751 --> 07:45.476
I consulted with her,

07:45.501 --> 07:46.771
but I did it for you!

07:46.796 --> 07:49.568
You did her, for you!

07:49.593 --> 07:52.209
I swear... give me a divorce,

07:52.234 --> 07:54.167
or I'm gonna kill you.

07:54.385 --> 07:57.453
She just threatened to kill him
if he didn't give her the divorce.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.707
- You're overreacting.
- Look at me, Mark, look at me, Mark!

08:00.732 --> 08:02.732
Okay, same place, different argument.

08:02.757 --> 08:05.282
- With his wife?
- No, different woman.

08:05.831 --> 08:07.584
Her face is wrapped in bandages.

08:07.609 --> 08:09.757
- Beat up? Accident?
- <i>The Mummy</i> ?

08:09.782 --> 08:12.209
1932, 1999 or 2017?

08:12.234 --> 08:13.833
'32. Of course.

08:13.873 --> 08:14.959
Uh, boys?

08:14.984 --> 08:17.139
You met someone new, didn't you?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.465
- No.
- Didn't you?

08:19.490 --> 08:21.685
She's accusing him of
cheating on her, too.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.777
He was a divorce lawyer.
Fifty percent of everyone he worked with

08:23.802 --> 08:26.021
wanted to kill him a
hundred percent of the time.

08:30.451 --> 08:35.434
I'm still at Broden's apartment.
He is with yet another woman.

08:46.305 --> 08:48.973
I'm getting a patchy neurosync again,
just like last time.

08:48.998 --> 08:50.747
Heart rate and respiration
are increasing.

08:50.772 --> 08:51.898
Kirsten, what's goin' on in there?

08:51.923 --> 08:53.790
This is exactly what happened last time.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.215
Yeah, it is.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.732
Broden's memory record shows
his brain flooded with oxytocin.

08:57.757 --> 09:00.301
Ah! The love hormone.

09:00.326 --> 09:02.217
That's my favorite hormone.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.574
No, wait. It's estrogen.

09:04.599 --> 09:05.716
Princess, you okay?

09:05.741 --> 09:07.490
Yeah.

09:07.515 --> 09:09.390
Just, uh...

09:10.920 --> 09:13.559
- Boss?
- I think she should bounce.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.534
I heard that.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.606
No, I'm good. Just trust me.

09:18.631 --> 09:20.310
Okay, who's the woman Broden's with?

09:20.335 --> 09:22.114
I don't know, but there's...
There's something about her,

09:22.139 --> 09:25.979
it's like... he thinks she's perfect.

09:26.795 --> 09:29.654
All right,
I'm moving you to the death memory.

09:33.107 --> 09:34.621
I'm having trouble breathing.

09:34.646 --> 09:37.646
Broden's in bed with Miss Perfect.
He can't breathe.

09:37.671 --> 09:39.693
Death memory in 40 seconds.

09:39.718 --> 09:41.146
Ayo: Respiration is struggling.

09:41.171 --> 09:42.146
(trying to breathe)

09:42.171 --> 09:42.990
Let me help.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.099
You know you can't help me.

09:44.545 --> 09:46.629
Oxygen levels are critical.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.989
Cameron: Kirsten, I want you to bounce.

09:48.014 --> 09:51.427
I haven't seen... shooter.

09:51.452 --> 09:53.123
Move her.
Move her closer to the death memory.

09:53.148 --> 09:55.428
- She'll get there in 30 seconds.
- She doesn't have 30 seconds.

09:55.452 --> 09:56.333
Linus, do it!

09:56.359 --> 09:57.734
(keys tapping)

09:57.759 --> 10:01.052
(struggling to breathe)

10:01.077 --> 10:02.333
Death memory in two seconds.

10:02.358 --> 10:03.295
(gasp)

10:03.320 --> 10:04.709
Total respiratory failure!

10:04.734 --> 10:06.759
Kirsten, make the bounce!

10:09.961 --> 10:11.994
(gasping for air)

10:12.019 --> 10:16.170
Relax, relax. Breathe. Breathe.

10:20.199 --> 10:21.998
(sighs)

10:23.295 --> 10:24.771
Hey, you okay?

10:25.695 --> 10:28.563
Yeah. I'm fine.

10:29.570 --> 10:31.270
Cameron, are you okay?

10:31.295 --> 10:33.627
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Did you see who shot Broden?

10:34.055 --> 10:36.623
Broden died of asphyxiation.

10:36.648 --> 10:39.682
Wait. What? He died
and then he was shot?

10:39.707 --> 10:41.852
Someone must really hate this guy.

10:41.877 --> 10:44.777
Unless they didn't know he
was dead when they shot him.

10:44.813 --> 10:46.928
So who did it? The ex?
The Mummy? Miss Perfect?

10:46.953 --> 10:49.528
Or all or none of the above.

10:52.647 --> 10:54.678
Find anything more on Broden?

10:54.703 --> 10:58.030
He was a pit bull. Real workaholic,
impressive string of wins.

10:58.055 --> 11:00.039
Left a lotta angry ex-spouses out there.

11:00.064 --> 11:01.397
None more so than his own.

11:01.422 --> 11:02.989
Are divorce records public?

11:03.014 --> 11:05.037
Not his, was a closed proceeding.

11:05.070 --> 11:06.860
If he was having an affair,
the only ones who knew about it

11:06.885 --> 11:08.646
were Broden and his mistress.

11:08.671 --> 11:10.976
Oh, mistresses.

11:11.001 --> 11:13.035
The M.E.'s still working
up the tox screen,

11:13.070 --> 11:15.649
meanwhile, detectives found a
9mm at the ex-wife's apartment.

11:15.673 --> 11:18.423
They're running ballistics now to see if
it matches that bullet from Broden's body.

11:18.448 --> 11:20.874
Which didn't kill him.

11:20.899 --> 11:22.773
Which someone still shot him with.

11:22.798 --> 11:24.674
Mm.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.294
What?

11:30.329 --> 11:32.257
Say something managerial.

11:32.282 --> 11:34.226
Let's bring in the ex,
see what she has to say.

11:34.251 --> 11:36.717
- Atta boy.
- Oh, was that so hard?

11:36.742 --> 11:39.792
- (elevator dings)
- Camille, wait.

11:39.817 --> 11:43.067
(sighs) I'm sorry.

11:43.568 --> 11:45.875
I'm sorry.
I'm just really goin' through it here.

11:45.900 --> 11:49.725
Me, too. That's why I want
you to pilot the next stitch.

11:50.821 --> 11:53.234
Does this have anything
to do with your shakes?

11:53.259 --> 11:56.025
Just do it.

12:00.976 --> 12:04.500
I was never good enough for Mark.
Can you believe that?

12:04.525 --> 12:07.293
Kept trying to... improve me.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.987
Turn me into what he
thought I should be.

12:10.012 --> 12:12.748
My clothes. My hair. My makeup.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.374
I even got a boob job. For him.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.344
Look at these!

12:19.026 --> 12:21.748
They ruined my modeling career. Yeah.

12:21.773 --> 12:23.108
You can stop looking now.

12:23.133 --> 12:23.913
Yeah. (Clears throat)

12:23.938 --> 12:25.381
My clothes don't hang right anymore.

12:25.406 --> 12:27.339
I haven't booked work in two years.

12:27.375 --> 12:31.076
I know I did it to myself. But I really
thought it would make Mark happy.

12:31.112 --> 12:33.245
And do you know the thanks I got?

12:33.281 --> 12:35.849
He started shtupping
the plastic surgeon.

12:35.874 --> 12:39.809
Miss Broden, security video places you at
your husband's home the night of his death.

12:39.845 --> 12:42.718
- And?
- And... we found a gun at your place,

12:42.743 --> 12:45.781
the same caliber as the
gun that shot your husband.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.718
Are you saying I killed him?

12:48.260 --> 12:51.662
What we're saying is that we're running
ballistics on your gun right now,

12:51.687 --> 12:54.787
and if the results are a match,
and then you decide to confess,

12:54.812 --> 12:57.429
well, the judge will look at that
like you were hiding the truth

12:57.454 --> 12:59.412
until you were trapped.

13:01.444 --> 13:04.093
She still had a key to the apartment,
so she let herself in,

13:04.118 --> 13:07.273
found him alone in bed,
went right up to him and... popped him.

13:07.298 --> 13:08.452
Did she say if he was asleep?

13:08.477 --> 13:10.070
Camille: She thought he was.
But she also said

13:10.095 --> 13:11.564
that he was quiet, which was unusual,

13:11.589 --> 13:14.289
because Broden,
in addition to his other fine qualities,

13:14.314 --> 13:16.099
snored, loudly.

13:16.124 --> 13:17.744
She also said he was having an affair.

13:17.769 --> 13:21.132
With a Dr. Sophia Torres,
plastic surgeon to the stars.

13:21.157 --> 13:25.240
Okay, wait, so the suspects now
are the ex, uh, Miss Perfect,

13:25.265 --> 13:27.165
the Mummy, and Doc Hollywood?

13:27.190 --> 13:30.158
Well, the ex is an ex-suspect,
at least for the potential murder.

13:30.183 --> 13:32.367
Could he have died of an
allergic reaction to something?

13:32.392 --> 13:33.467
Poisoned?

13:33.887 --> 13:36.585
Maybe. All right,
I'll head back to Broden's apartment,

13:36.610 --> 13:37.834
see if forensics missed anything.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.585
I can follow up on the
poisoning angle with the M.E.,

13:39.610 --> 13:40.757
that would show up on a tox screen.

13:40.782 --> 13:43.319
And I'll set up a meeting
with Doc Hollywood.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.150
Kirsten, can I see you
in my office, please?

13:50.365 --> 13:53.564
Am I being fired?
Give it to me straight, boss.

13:57.017 --> 13:58.789
Okay.

13:59.219 --> 14:00.852
What's goin' on?

14:00.877 --> 14:02.673
(exhales) Look,
I've got certain responsibilities here

14:02.698 --> 14:04.297
that make things a little...

14:04.322 --> 14:06.206
- Awkward.
- Yeah, I know, but I don't

14:06.231 --> 14:09.174
want it to be, I don't wanna be
walking on eggshells with you.

14:09.199 --> 14:10.532
But I got a job to do.

14:10.557 --> 14:12.892
I know. And I'm sorry about before.

14:12.917 --> 14:16.704
I'm gonna be fully supportive
of you, okay? Don't worry.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.690
Hm?

14:22.294 --> 14:24.494
Linus: Knock it off, you two! (Groans)

14:24.530 --> 14:26.294
- You're right.
- Mm.

14:26.319 --> 14:28.408
This is... This is unprofessional.

14:28.433 --> 14:31.333
What? No. Personally, I
don't care if you guys do it

14:31.358 --> 14:35.026
in the corpse cassette. I mean, knock
it off if you wanna keep on stitching.

14:35.087 --> 14:36.446
Wait... What's goin' on?

14:36.471 --> 14:38.692
I figured out why Kirsten's
having trouble in the stitches.

14:38.717 --> 14:41.178
Why the neurosync is off. Oxytocin.

14:41.203 --> 14:43.442
At first, I thought it was
due to the high oxytocin

14:43.467 --> 14:47.006
levels in the victim's brain record
whenever the stitch got a little, uh...

14:47.031 --> 14:49.028
- you know...
- Steamy?

14:49.053 --> 14:52.587
Mm-hm. But I found out that
it wasn't the victims' steam

14:52.612 --> 14:55.379
that was fogging things
up, it was yours.

14:55.404 --> 14:58.867
The stitches act like triggers. From
what I can see, your brain chemistry

14:58.892 --> 15:01.335
has changed ever since you
escaped your own memory loop.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.084
- It's flooded.
- With oxytocin? Because...

15:04.109 --> 15:07.659
Because of you. You stud.

15:07.684 --> 15:11.509
Oxytocin levels rise within the
first six months of a relationship.

15:11.534 --> 15:15.402
The more physically intimate you
guys are, the more it's gonna mess

15:15.427 --> 15:16.526
with your ability to stitch.

15:16.551 --> 15:18.418
Okay, so then, where does that leave us?

15:18.443 --> 15:20.677
You know, just like, holding hands
and takin' long walks on the beach?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.067
Shorter walks would be safer.

15:22.092 --> 15:24.395
- Well, how do we fix this?
- I can program some kind

15:24.420 --> 15:26.645
of filter that'll make the
stitch a little less wonky.

15:26.670 --> 15:30.338
But if you guys wanna continue stitching,
you're gonna have to slow down.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.729
A lot.

15:31.754 --> 15:33.317
Hold hands.

15:33.342 --> 15:36.409
- Mm?
- Cuddle. Share a bed.

15:36.630 --> 15:39.978
But anything more than a stand-up
double, and I have no idea

15:40.003 --> 15:42.227
what it's gonna do to
your ability to stitch.

16:10.577 --> 16:12.210
(squirting)

16:24.008 --> 16:25.407
(phone ringing)

16:25.432 --> 16:30.303
Camille! I need a decontamination
unit over to Broden's right now.

16:30.798 --> 16:32.345
I think I've been poisoned.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.663
Exploding coconut water.

16:37.689 --> 16:41.126
Apparently,
Broden's cuckoo for coconut water.

16:41.151 --> 16:43.307
Now, the container that
Fisher found himself

16:43.332 --> 16:45.627
on the nasty end of was
injected with a bacterium

16:45.652 --> 16:52.256
called clostidridium botulinim, which is
the toxin used to create, boop, botox,

16:52.281 --> 16:58.552
which ingested, can cause paralysis,
asphyxiation, and sometimes death.

16:58.577 --> 16:59.781
L'chaim!

16:59.806 --> 17:00.634
To Fisher.

17:00.659 --> 17:03.307
And his ability to
keep his mouth... shut.

17:03.332 --> 17:05.554
A skill I wish someone
else was better at.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.554
Hm? What?

17:08.930 --> 17:12.064
Is this because I told you and
Kirsten about the oxytocin thing?

17:12.089 --> 17:14.733
What oxytocin thing?

17:14.759 --> 17:17.492
Apparently,
the more intimate Cameron and I get,

17:17.528 --> 17:20.252
the more flooded with
oxytocin my brain is,

17:20.292 --> 17:22.885
and the more impaired my
ability to stitch becomes.

17:22.910 --> 17:25.079
So you two can't...

17:25.104 --> 17:27.696
(chuckling) Hm.

17:27.722 --> 17:33.424
But back to the case. So, uh, Doc Hollywood
put botox in Broden's coconut water?

17:33.449 --> 17:35.588
I mean,
it would explain Broden asphyxiating.

17:35.613 --> 17:39.923
Doc Hollywood slips botox into the
coconut water, Broden drinks it,

17:39.948 --> 17:42.988
asphyxiates, dies,
then the ex shoots him.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.726
You can't make this stuff up.

17:45.761 --> 17:48.239
W... We don't know Doc
Hollywood did it for sure.

17:48.264 --> 17:50.003
Kirsten and I have a
meeting with her tomorrow.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.124
Yeah.
So do we have the rest of the night off?

17:52.149 --> 17:53.506
Mm-hm.

17:57.432 --> 17:59.132
(clears throat)

18:00.743 --> 18:02.705
Just... go to bed.

18:02.730 --> 18:05.530
(clears throat) Good night.

18:09.569 --> 18:11.169
Where you goin'?

18:11.194 --> 18:13.956
Home. To take the first in
what promises to be a series

18:13.981 --> 18:16.737
of cold showers.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.848
So how was your night?

18:23.082 --> 18:26.137
Lonely. Yours?

18:26.232 --> 18:27.787
Not great.

18:27.812 --> 18:30.372
We can do this. We have to do this
if we're gonna save my mother.

18:30.397 --> 18:32.037
Oh, I know.

18:32.062 --> 18:33.495
I'm with you.

18:39.721 --> 18:42.323
Please have a seat.
Dr. Torres will be right with you.

18:42.348 --> 18:44.356
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.878
Hey, you find it a little odd that
this whole place smells like money,

18:50.903 --> 18:53.003
yet there was no one
in that waiting room?

18:53.028 --> 18:54.503
Slow day?

18:54.528 --> 18:56.979
A plastic surgery place in
Beverly Hills with no patients

18:57.004 --> 18:59.961
is like Arkham without inmates.

19:00.588 --> 19:01.901
What does that mean?

19:01.926 --> 19:04.911
Hello. I'm Dr. Torres.

19:06.042 --> 19:07.141
(clearing throat)

19:07.177 --> 19:10.901
Uh, Dr. Torres, I'm Agent Goodkin,
this is Agent Clark.

19:10.926 --> 19:12.776
We're with the, uh, NSA.

19:12.801 --> 19:17.018
So I've heard.
I also heard what happened to Mark.

19:17.164 --> 19:19.400
Don't expect me to be
all weepy about it.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.259
Uh, so I guess you don't have,
uh, very many fond memories

19:22.294 --> 19:24.194
from when you and Mr.
Broden were dating?

19:24.230 --> 19:28.363
Dating? That would imply
an emotional connection?

19:28.766 --> 19:32.162
I'm not sure Mark was capable of that.

19:33.347 --> 19:35.080
Do you find me attractive?

19:35.105 --> 19:36.204
Excuse me?

19:36.229 --> 19:41.222
Of course you don't.
I'm a latex, botox, goddamn freak!

19:41.247 --> 19:42.613
And do you know who I did this for?

19:42.648 --> 19:45.349
- Mark Broden.
- Why?

19:45.384 --> 19:49.186
He kept pushing me and
pushing me to change my look.

19:49.221 --> 19:52.222
Said he wanted me to be perfect.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.662
He always wanted more.

19:55.946 --> 20:00.618
Your facial surgeries.
You must've been pretty bandaged up.

20:00.643 --> 20:03.432
My whole face.
I mean, you cannot imagine the pain

20:03.458 --> 20:06.526
that I put myself through. All for him.

20:07.099 --> 20:09.032
And now look at me.

20:09.201 --> 20:14.274
Do you really think, honestly, that
somebody is gonna trust a plastic surgeon

20:14.299 --> 20:16.199
who looks like this?

20:16.657 --> 20:20.459
And after you did this to yourself,
he left you?

20:21.917 --> 20:24.050
For someone new.

20:25.987 --> 20:30.547
Someone... perfect.

20:30.670 --> 20:32.904
(phone rings)

20:33.572 --> 20:38.542
Hm, it's uh, the o... office, okay,
I'll be... I'll be right back, sorry.

20:38.577 --> 20:42.412
- Camille, hi.
- How's it going with Doc Hollywood?

20:42.448 --> 20:45.463
Have any work done?
Make your nose a little less buttony?

20:45.488 --> 20:48.222
Funny. Listen, Doc
Hollywood is the Mummy,

20:48.247 --> 20:49.438
and she hated Broden.

20:50.085 --> 20:51.736
She could be our killer.

20:51.761 --> 20:55.027
The only thing she's guilty of is
working in an industry that perpetuates

20:55.052 --> 20:56.574
negative body image.

20:56.599 --> 20:57.833
I heard back from the M.E.

20:57.858 --> 21:00.667
There's absolutely no evidence
of botulism in Broden's body.

21:00.692 --> 21:04.249
She may have botoxed his coconut water,
but he never drank it.

21:04.274 --> 21:09.541
Wait, so... neither the ex nor
Doc Hollywood killed Broden?

21:09.566 --> 21:12.666
- Apparently not.
- So, what? Natural causes?

21:12.823 --> 21:15.141
Looking into it as we speak.

21:15.497 --> 21:17.592
(crash)

21:26.652 --> 21:29.286
Don't... move.

21:29.750 --> 21:30.916
Relax.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.875
Listen, Doc Hollywood,
I'm sure whatever...

21:32.900 --> 21:35.652
- Dr. Torres...
- Shut up!

21:36.574 --> 21:38.307
I had an old copy of the key,

21:38.332 --> 21:39.631
and I went over there last week,

21:39.656 --> 21:42.969
and I injected botox into
that bastard's coconut water.

21:42.994 --> 21:46.862
And you know what? I'm not sorry.

21:47.016 --> 21:52.516
He killed me...
the real me, a long time ago.

21:52.704 --> 21:54.504
And now we're even.

21:54.529 --> 21:56.371
He never drank the water.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.909
You're lying.

22:01.848 --> 22:03.754
Here's what's gonna happen:

22:03.778 --> 22:09.329
Me and... Agent "Hair Extensions" and I,
we're walkin' outta here,

22:09.470 --> 22:12.830
Try and stop us, and I swear I
will pump him so full of Botox

22:12.855 --> 22:15.330
he'll be dead before he hits the floor.

22:15.705 --> 22:18.706
Dr. Torres, Mrs. Reece
called to cancel...

22:21.861 --> 22:23.795
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just gonna need

22:23.822 --> 22:25.622
something for my worry lines.

22:28.478 --> 22:33.236
So, Doc Hollywood, aka the Mummy,
put Botox in the coconut water

22:33.261 --> 22:36.095
last week hoping Broden would drink it.
But he didn't.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.423
So then, a couple days later,
the ex comes over, puts a bullet

22:38.448 --> 22:42.134
in Broden, only he's already dead,
just not from the coconut water.

22:42.159 --> 22:45.775
So unless it was natural causes
there's really only one suspect left.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.517
Mm-hm. Miss Perfect.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.992
All right. Let's stitch in and see
if we can figure out who she is.

22:50.017 --> 22:53.292
Camille? You're up.

22:54.142 --> 22:55.908
Wait, you're handling this stitch?

22:55.944 --> 22:58.177
Cameron asked me to.

22:58.212 --> 23:02.501
He's got the yips. He's worried about
you. And it's getting in the way.

23:02.527 --> 23:03.704
He's been under a lot
of pressure lately.

23:03.729 --> 23:05.915
Yeah, and no way to release it.

23:06.090 --> 23:09.291
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be back in the saddle

23:09.316 --> 23:12.384
within a day or two.
And of course I mean the stitch saddle,

23:12.409 --> 23:14.066
not the... saddle.

23:14.091 --> 23:16.298
- You got this, right?
- Absolutely.

23:16.323 --> 23:21.360
Any... Um... any chance you and
Cameron can have a good old-fashioned

23:21.385 --> 23:25.387
platonic date... elsewhere tonight?

23:25.412 --> 23:27.112
You met someone?

23:27.137 --> 23:29.198
Something like that.

23:29.734 --> 23:31.777
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

23:31.802 --> 23:33.597
Don't you mean "can't" do?

23:33.622 --> 23:36.897
- Ooh.
- No.

23:41.178 --> 23:43.311
Broden's in bed with Miss Perfect.

23:43.972 --> 23:45.049
Linus?

23:45.074 --> 23:47.474
Oxytocin filter seems to be kickin' in.

23:51.192 --> 23:52.994
I... I'm havin' trouble breathing.

23:53.019 --> 23:55.944
He's... starting to get into trouble.

23:57.176 --> 23:58.938
Okay, Camille, stay focused.

23:58.963 --> 24:01.635
I'm totally focused. Relax, boss.

24:01.660 --> 24:03.110
Let me help.

24:03.135 --> 24:05.088
(struggling to breathe)
You know you can't help me.

24:05.113 --> 24:05.847
(beeping)

24:05.872 --> 24:07.847
Kirsten's oxygen levels
are dropping again.

24:07.872 --> 24:10.448
- Okay, I should take over.
- I got it.

24:10.473 --> 24:14.423
Kirsten, I'm keeping you from flashing
forward this time. Tell us what you see.

24:14.448 --> 24:18.188
Broden's on his feet. Barely.

24:22.391 --> 24:26.376
(labored breathing)

24:26.401 --> 24:30.017
No! No, please don't put me in there.

24:30.042 --> 24:33.204
Mark... please.

24:36.361 --> 24:40.789
He has a hidden space...
hidden behind a painting.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.582
He's forcing Miss Perfect into it.

24:43.628 --> 24:47.501
(struggling to breathe)

24:47.526 --> 24:50.336
- Death memory in 12 seconds.
- Okay, that's enough.

24:50.361 --> 24:51.306
Kirsten, make the bounce.

24:51.331 --> 24:54.681
(struggling to breathe)

25:00.142 --> 25:04.136
Broden kept Miss Perfect hostage
in a secret chamber near his bed.

25:04.161 --> 25:08.127
There's no indication on the police
report of anything like that.

25:08.229 --> 25:11.638
She's still in there.
Camille, call Fisher. Go!

25:22.477 --> 25:25.695
Hold on, miss,
we're gonna get you outta there!

25:31.665 --> 25:32.731
(thud)

25:35.575 --> 25:37.563
Is she dead?

25:39.740 --> 25:42.340
I'm not sure how to answer that.

25:57.327 --> 25:59.553
Clearly,
she couldn't be the one who killed him.

25:59.578 --> 26:01.483
Linus: Not unless she's
the bride of Chucky.

26:01.508 --> 26:05.405
On a very special episode of
<i>The Stitch Lab Gone Wild...</i>

26:05.430 --> 26:06.985
We're just examining her for clues.

26:07.010 --> 26:09.415
Sure, let's go with that.
Kirsten, you saw her in the stitch

26:09.440 --> 26:11.101
and said she was real.

26:11.126 --> 26:14.711
She was Broden's fantasy of a perfect
woman. In his mind, she was real.

26:14.736 --> 26:17.016
Or at least, he wanted her to be real.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.016
And so that's why I
saw her as real, too.

26:19.041 --> 26:21.108
Things are about to get
a whole lot stranger.

26:21.330 --> 26:25.132
She's equipped with audio and
video recording capabilities.

26:25.157 --> 26:27.086
Aw, man,
so he was recording himself with her?

26:27.111 --> 26:31.747
Mmm, that's it, I need a bucket. I'd rather
have a one percent chance with a real human

26:31.772 --> 26:34.105
than a 100 percent
chance with a rubber one.

26:34.130 --> 26:37.079
Guys, Broden was with
her when he started

26:37.104 --> 26:40.509
having trouble breathing. She might've
recorded what happened to him.

26:40.534 --> 26:43.672
Yeah... we got a problem.

26:43.697 --> 26:45.797
We can't view it here.

26:45.822 --> 26:47.956
I don't even wanna know
where you pulled that from.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.422
A slot... from the back of her head.

26:50.447 --> 26:53.086
You see, Miss Perfect here
doesn't save data internally.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.078
It uploads to a
cloud-based storage system.

26:55.103 --> 26:57.321
So who made it? Her? It? Her?

26:57.346 --> 26:59.771
Well, there's a serial
number on the CPU.

26:59.796 --> 27:03.046
Heh! I kid you not.

27:05.180 --> 27:08.680
"Valley of the Love Dolls"?

27:12.033 --> 27:14.483
So, I shouldn't call them love dolls.

27:14.508 --> 27:15.608
- No.
- Sex dolls?

27:15.633 --> 27:16.799
- No.
- So, what do we call them?

27:16.824 --> 27:17.621
I don't know.

27:17.646 --> 27:18.920
Didn't you used to play
with dolls as a kid?

27:18.945 --> 27:20.819
Not this type of doll.

27:20.844 --> 27:24.227
(chuckles) Whoa,
that must've cost an arm and a leg.

27:24.448 --> 27:27.366
What? I thought you found
my sense of humor disarming.

27:27.391 --> 27:29.141
Seriously, Cameron, stop.

27:29.166 --> 27:32.200
Oh, I don't know if I can. This place
is a pretty target-rich environment.

27:32.432 --> 27:34.977
You must Agents Clark
and Goodkin from the NSA.

27:35.002 --> 27:36.768
Yes. You're Mrs. Underhill?

27:36.793 --> 27:38.025
- Julie.
- Mm.

27:38.050 --> 27:39.817
Oh! It's not gonna
fall off on me, is it?

27:39.842 --> 27:41.402
I'm kidding.

27:41.713 --> 27:44.702
- Can you just stop it?
- It was a joke.

27:47.727 --> 27:50.960
Hey, thanks for agreeing to speak to us
about your, uh, sex dolls... love dolls...

27:50.985 --> 27:52.952
<i>Dolls d'amour,</i> shall we say?

27:52.987 --> 27:54.985
We prefer to call them companions.

27:55.121 --> 27:56.757
And we call the company
"Valley of the Love Dolls"

27:56.782 --> 27:59.203
because people seem to
like old movie references.

27:59.228 --> 28:03.128
So, Agents Goodkin and Clark, you're...
you're investigating a homicide?

28:03.153 --> 28:05.897
A possible homicide. One of your
customers died two nights ago,

28:05.922 --> 28:07.008
Mark Broden?

28:07.033 --> 28:10.438
If it was a crime, it's possible that
his companion recorded it, and we'd like

28:10.463 --> 28:14.355
to look at any audio or video
that was uploaded to your servers.

28:15.149 --> 28:17.215
Is that a problem?

28:17.240 --> 28:19.032
We cater to a very elite clientele.

28:19.057 --> 28:21.254
Politicians, celebrities, judges.

28:21.279 --> 28:23.179
They expect us to protect their privacy.

28:23.204 --> 28:25.664
Yeah, Julie's right. We don't want
to withhold information from the NSA,

28:25.689 --> 28:28.083
but, we can't release anything
without a court order.

28:28.108 --> 28:30.378
Just puts us in a very
vulnerable position.

28:30.403 --> 28:32.439
No problem. We'll come
back with a warrant.

28:32.464 --> 28:33.724
Sorry for any trouble.

28:33.749 --> 28:36.483
- That's okay.
- Wanna see how we make our companions?

28:41.450 --> 28:42.727
(whistles)

28:42.767 --> 28:43.932
Whoa.

28:44.900 --> 28:47.601
Sam: I started all of this as a hobby.

28:47.738 --> 28:51.640
But Jules here... she
is the real visionary.

28:51.675 --> 28:54.743
Turning my mad pastime into a business.

28:54.779 --> 28:56.132
Perfect team, huh?

28:56.157 --> 28:58.876
Takes hard work and open communication.

28:58.901 --> 29:01.601
A little jealous devotion helps too.

29:01.763 --> 29:04.351
Julie: Not when it gets
you a night in jail.

29:04.398 --> 29:06.531
Sam: That was a long time ago.

29:06.732 --> 29:08.598
We were at a bar in Tucson.

29:08.623 --> 29:12.592
This creep made some comment about
my looks, and Sam belted him.

29:12.617 --> 29:14.884
I was so angry.

29:14.909 --> 29:18.408
Now I'm just embarrassed.

29:18.472 --> 29:21.958
I need to talk to Jennifer about
adding another enhancement.

29:22.829 --> 29:25.730
- Our employees are artists.
- (no audible dialogue)

29:25.844 --> 29:27.458
You know, they put a lot of time

29:27.483 --> 29:28.639
and creativity into what they do.

29:28.664 --> 29:30.589
So, you know, they can
get a little intense

29:30.614 --> 29:32.882
when customers make last minute changes.

29:32.907 --> 29:34.273
Like Broden did.

29:34.405 --> 29:38.119
He always wanted enhancements,
and then he'd just... change it up,

29:38.144 --> 29:39.069
all over again.

29:39.094 --> 29:41.094
Spun everyone out until
he was finally satisfied.

29:41.119 --> 29:44.497
Anyone, uh, spun out enough to kill him?

29:44.522 --> 29:47.294
We're artists. We're not killers.

29:51.004 --> 29:52.184
Kirsten: Mm-hm.

29:52.209 --> 29:55.640
Who knew there could
be so many, um, uh...

29:55.674 --> 29:56.808
Enhancements?

29:56.833 --> 29:58.239
Yeah.

29:59.576 --> 30:01.475
Well, that's enough
about that for tonight.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.605
- Mm.
- So, what now? Do you wanna stay here?

30:05.630 --> 30:06.925
You wanna go back to your place?

30:06.950 --> 30:10.573
Oh, Camille wanted the house to herself
tonight. She's having "company."

30:10.598 --> 30:14.033
Oh, well. At least someone's...

30:14.221 --> 30:17.471
It's so much harder than
I thought it would be.

30:17.496 --> 30:19.119
What... You thought us

30:19.144 --> 30:22.369
not being together would be easier?

30:22.579 --> 30:24.191
You hear how that sounds, don't you?

30:24.216 --> 30:26.583
What? How could you say that to me?

30:26.981 --> 30:28.681
Do you know how long I waited for you?

30:28.706 --> 30:31.098
Are you kidding me?
Not nearly as long as I was willing

30:31.123 --> 30:32.621
to wait for you,
and I'm still willing to wait for you

30:32.646 --> 30:35.102
- if that's what you need, but...
- Okay, so what do you want from me?

30:35.127 --> 30:36.206
You want me to give up on my mother?

30:36.231 --> 30:37.355
No. I just don't think

30:37.380 --> 30:38.378
your heart is breaking like mine is

30:38.403 --> 30:39.199
over the fact that we physically

30:39.224 --> 30:41.499
- can't be together.
- Really? Is that what you think?

30:41.524 --> 30:43.149
I don't know. You tell me.

30:44.465 --> 30:48.066
Okay. You know, I think we should
take the night off from each other.

30:48.091 --> 30:49.824
I think you're right.

30:50.873 --> 30:52.174

31:15.971 --> 31:18.905
- It's very nice.
- But...?

31:19.085 --> 31:20.938
What? No! I... I love the lyrics,

31:20.963 --> 31:24.235
they're so pretty. I mean... I...
I don't think you need the "C",

31:29.932 --> 31:31.665
Do you have something you wanna tell me?

31:31.690 --> 31:33.454

- Why didn't you tell me?

Oh, well, that's stupid.

31:41.323 --> 31:46.587
I just feel...
like I'm constantly being judged.

31:46.612 --> 31:53.269

needed one thing that's just for me.

You know,
that no one can judge me into hating.

31:57.405 --> 32:00.133
Well, I don't judge.

32:01.393 --> 32:02.592
Play.

32:02.617 --> 32:03.969

- Yeah, play.

32:03.994 --> 32:08.081
Oh, god.
You're putting me on the spot, girl.

(clears throat)

33:20.876 --> 33:24.577
This fancy piece of equipment you're
in is called the corpse cassette.

33:24.613 --> 33:26.947
Although that doesn't exactly
fit your situation, does it?

33:26.982 --> 33:29.399
I'm gonna run a material
analysis on you.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.877
I'll be gentle.

33:34.209 --> 33:36.575
(typing)

33:42.584 --> 33:44.384
Holy hell.

33:44.409 --> 33:46.409
Give me 20 more.

33:46.434 --> 33:47.666
Come on, dig deep.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.324
(laughs)

33:49.349 --> 33:51.772
It's funny. I remember saying
you could stay tonight,

33:51.797 --> 33:54.999
but I don't remember asking
you to be my personal trainer.

33:55.024 --> 33:56.195
This is good. What is it?

33:56.220 --> 33:58.019
Uh, I don't know what it's called.

33:58.055 --> 33:59.470
Linus ordered it.

34:00.497 --> 34:02.720
Okay, coach. (Exhales)

34:04.758 --> 34:06.127
What is your assessment?

34:06.163 --> 34:08.518
Well, I don't believe
that that was 20 reps,

34:08.543 --> 34:12.177
but you're in great shape, and you
need to work on your flexibility.

34:12.202 --> 34:15.570
I am hoping Linus will
help me with that.

34:15.594 --> 34:18.270
- He's coming over. Tonight.
- Oh, really?

34:18.306 --> 34:22.922
So, why aren't you out with
Dr. Scientific American?

34:23.623 --> 34:25.324
Cameron and I had a fight.

34:25.349 --> 34:29.735
We're... mm, going
through a rough patch.

34:30.460 --> 34:33.800
Two words: "makeup sex."

34:33.824 --> 34:36.601
Yeah, well,
we're kinda not doing that right now.

34:36.626 --> 34:38.579
Really? Is it a performance kinda thing?

34:38.603 --> 34:39.770
(laughs) No.

34:40.167 --> 34:41.833
- Mm.
- Mm.

34:41.858 --> 34:42.924
What are you gonna do?

34:42.949 --> 34:44.282
I don't know.

34:47.237 --> 34:53.329
Is this, um... too soon, us
doing the whole sister routine?

34:53.630 --> 34:55.208
Maybe.

34:55.411 --> 34:57.823
But... I like it.

34:57.848 --> 34:59.308
So do I.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.208
(phone chimes)

35:03.092 --> 35:05.859
Oh. I gotta go.

35:05.884 --> 35:08.112
Thank you, for dinner.

35:08.137 --> 35:10.808
Mm-hm. Well...

35:12.139 --> 35:14.072
uh, I hope everything
works out with Cameron.

35:14.096 --> 35:16.283
Thanks. Me too.

35:17.647 --> 35:19.668
(laughs)

35:22.746 --> 35:25.647
- This better be good.
- This better be better than good.

35:25.672 --> 35:27.817
Ooh, it's way better.

35:27.842 --> 35:29.339
I know who killed Broden.

35:29.364 --> 35:30.289
Who?

35:30.314 --> 35:31.361
Miss Perfect.

35:31.386 --> 35:34.139
If this is a joke, Miss Perfect
is gonna have company in there.

35:34.164 --> 35:37.723
Broden died from a severe allergic
reaction to Ducoflex 9090,

35:37.748 --> 35:41.716
the exact latex that Miss
Perfect is made from.

35:41.741 --> 35:44.421
Wait, wait, so it wasn't a
murder but an accidental death?

35:44.446 --> 35:48.325
Two real women wanted him dead, but the
fake one is the one that killed him.

35:48.350 --> 35:50.825
You... You really can't
make this stuff up.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.699
Oh, kids, well, before we all do

35:52.725 --> 35:53.724
the "case closed" happy dance,

35:53.749 --> 35:55.348
I just pulled up the order form

35:55.373 --> 35:57.265
for Miss Perfect from Broden's emails.

35:57.290 --> 36:01.394
Apparently, she is the second companion he
ordered from "Valley of the Love Dolls."

36:01.419 --> 36:06.019
He returned the first one, because, and
I quote, "she wasn't beautiful enough."

36:06.044 --> 36:09.372
This one was made to his exacting
standards, including that she not contain

36:09.397 --> 36:13.296
Ducoflex 9090. Apparently,
he knew he was allergic to the stuff.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.444
May I, for a second?

36:15.469 --> 36:16.441
Be my guest.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.141
Thank you.

36:19.378 --> 36:22.111
What was the model that Broden
ordered and then returned?

36:22.136 --> 36:23.987
Something called the "Desert Flower."

36:24.012 --> 36:25.956
(typing)

36:25.981 --> 36:28.860
Sam said Broden made
enemies at the company.

36:28.885 --> 36:30.653
Well, yeah,
but if I'm a chef at a restaurant,

36:30.678 --> 36:32.378
and someone sends back
the <i> Coquille St. Jacques</i>

36:32.403 --> 36:34.596
I'm not gonna go out and kill the guy.

36:34.621 --> 36:36.917
Unless you're sleeping with Coquille.

36:37.526 --> 36:38.874
Huh?

36:38.899 --> 36:40.532
Who does this remind you of?

36:41.977 --> 36:44.425
Fisher: Ooh, no way.

36:44.808 --> 36:46.472
Fisher, what are you doing right now?

36:46.497 --> 36:49.051
Going with you to the
Valley of the Love Dolls?

36:49.076 --> 36:51.022
I'm going too.

36:52.895 --> 36:56.497
I started this with you,
I'm gonna see it through to the end.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.634
Mr. Underhill,
thanks for meeting us so late.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.849
This is Detective Fisher, he's LAPD, he's
helping us with the murder of Mark Broden.

37:07.884 --> 37:09.150
Is this about the warrant?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.720
Still working on that.
We think that one of your employees

37:11.754 --> 37:12.920
may have killed Mr. Broden.

37:12.956 --> 37:15.103
None of my people hated him that much.

37:15.128 --> 37:16.766
Mind if we have a look around?

37:16.942 --> 37:18.416
No.

37:18.729 --> 37:23.866
Which one of these is the, uh...
"Desert Flower"?

37:24.043 --> 37:26.566
Uh, we don't have that model
in production at the moment.

37:26.591 --> 37:28.714
How about the "Desert Flower"
Broden returned? She around?

37:28.739 --> 37:31.883
We decommission any returned companions.
There's no market for them.

37:31.908 --> 37:33.266
Can't imagine there would be.

37:33.291 --> 37:36.134
Well, what do you do with them?
Throw them away? Melt them down?

37:36.159 --> 37:38.886
We never destroy something as
perfect as the "Desert Flower."

37:38.911 --> 37:41.612
Look if there's nothin' else I really
need to get back home to Julie.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.144
She was the, uh, the body model
for the "Desert Flower", yeah?

37:45.009 --> 37:47.292
We... We just, caught
a peek at the catalog.

37:47.317 --> 37:48.968
There's a striking resemblance there.

37:49.105 --> 37:51.239
You have an eye for
beauty, Agent Goodkin.

37:51.274 --> 37:53.908
- Thank you.
- Yes, Julie was the body model.

37:53.943 --> 37:57.078
She's perfectly
proportioned, so, why not?

37:57.113 --> 37:58.425
- Cameron: Heh.
- Must've really bothered you

37:58.450 --> 37:59.769
when Broden returned her.

37:59.794 --> 38:01.894
Made me very mad.

38:01.919 --> 38:03.853
I can imagine.

38:03.971 --> 38:05.871
I mean, you went all
beast-mode on a guy at a bar

38:05.896 --> 38:07.770
just for making a comment about her.

38:08.538 --> 38:11.517
Can't imagine what you would do
to someone who thought your wife

38:11.542 --> 38:14.897
was so disgusting that he couldn't
stand the sight of even being near her.

38:16.697 --> 38:18.397
Seriously?

38:18.422 --> 38:19.797
Let him go.

38:19.822 --> 38:22.392
This syringe is filled with silicone.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.829
And I will pump it directly
into Goodkin's carotid artery

38:24.854 --> 38:26.753
if you don't do exactly as I say.

38:26.778 --> 38:28.778
- Sam...
- Don't!

38:29.425 --> 38:32.291
No one has ever returned the
"Desert Flower."

38:32.316 --> 38:34.350
See, that's when I knew that Broden,
he had no idea,

38:34.385 --> 38:36.925
he had no idea what real perfection was.

38:36.950 --> 38:38.783
- Got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

38:38.808 --> 38:40.841
He didn't deserve a
companion like Julie.

38:40.866 --> 38:42.566
He didn't deserve to be on this earth.

38:42.591 --> 38:43.590
Take him.

38:43.615 --> 38:46.269
(gunshot)

38:49.680 --> 38:51.034
(groans)

38:51.059 --> 38:55.634
No. More. Jabbin' me. In. The neck!

38:55.658 --> 38:57.358
(groans)

38:57.889 --> 39:00.356
- Nice shot, Fisher.
- Yeah.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.258
You okay, boss?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.808
(voice on police radio)

39:08.833 --> 39:10.708
Cop: We're comin' back here.

39:12.084 --> 39:14.985
Cameron Goodkin, "armed" and dangerous.

39:15.010 --> 39:18.477
(laughs) Oh, I hate that I didn't
come up with that one myself.

39:18.502 --> 39:20.008
(laughs)

39:20.713 --> 39:23.514
I guess that perfect
couple was far from.

39:23.539 --> 39:26.158
There's no such thing
as a perfect couple.

39:26.183 --> 39:28.208
Not even you and Stephanie?

39:29.680 --> 39:32.547
We got plenty of stuff we're workin'
through.

39:32.572 --> 39:36.607
<i>I mean, we didn't get back together
thinkin' either of us was perfect.</i>

39:36.677 --> 39:40.320
<i>We got back together to find
the answer to the only question</i>

39:40.345 --> 39:42.312
<i>that really matters...</i>

39:42.398 --> 39:46.334
<i>after you get older and
the excitement fades,</i>

39:46.393 --> 39:49.774
<i>will we still be happy to spend
the rest of our lives together?</i>

39:51.642 --> 39:53.286
So what's the answer?

39:54.950 --> 39:56.227
Well, I'll let you know.

39:56.252 --> 39:56.938
(laughs)

39:56.963 --> 40:00.468
But right now, we're
leanin' hard into "yes."

40:00.493 --> 40:02.226
See ya.

40:04.937 --> 40:07.605
You know, I still can't go home.

40:09.189 --> 40:11.258
So where does that leave you?

40:14.445 --> 40:17.980
With my heart breaking
because we can't be together.

40:27.965 --> 40:29.765
(classical music playing on TV)

40:29.790 --> 40:32.858
- Kirsten: That was incredible.
- I knew you'd like it.

40:32.883 --> 40:35.239
Mind blowing.

40:36.878 --> 40:38.744
(TV turns off)

40:38.819 --> 40:41.092
Well, <i>2001: A Space
Odyssey</i> is pretty much

40:41.117 --> 40:43.909
the mind blowing <i>Godfather</i>
of sci-fi cinema.

40:43.934 --> 40:46.201
(laughs)

40:46.380 --> 40:49.751
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, thank Stanley Kubrick.

40:49.776 --> 40:51.576
No. Thank you.

40:53.097 --> 40:58.229
For this, for... agreeing
to just, hold off.

40:58.649 --> 41:00.314
Just until I save my mom.

41:00.339 --> 41:03.741
Kirsten, saving you mom's the
most important thing, I get it.

41:05.845 --> 41:07.845
You do, don't you?

41:07.870 --> 41:08.902
Mm-hm.

41:16.554 --> 41:18.387
How are those oxytocin levels?

41:18.412 --> 41:20.083
Holding steady. Yours?

41:20.108 --> 41:20.669
Cameron: Hm.

41:20.694 --> 41:24.692
(laughs) Never lower.
