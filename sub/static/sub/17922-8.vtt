00:26.157 --> 00:28.524
Let's go! Come on! In the hole!

00:28.526 --> 00:30.293
Get in!

00:30.294 --> 00:32.962
Yeah! Yeah!

00:32.963 --> 00:36.733
- Great putt, sir.
- That was beautiful. Oh, my God!

00:36.734 --> 00:40.236
- One moment. Here you go.
- You got it, sir?

00:40.237 --> 00:42.105
Seth, please, let the
caddie carry your bag.

00:42.106 --> 00:43.473
You don't have to prove anything.

00:43.474 --> 00:45.094
Honey, I'm not trying to prove anything.

00:45.095 --> 00:46.518
I always carry my own bag for luck.

00:46.519 --> 00:47.911
Well, it's working.

00:47.912 --> 00:50.172
But, remember, if you start
to feel tired or imbalanced,

00:50.173 --> 00:51.756
you can always stop and get some water.

00:51.757 --> 00:53.917
Honey, it's okay.

00:53.918 --> 00:55.385
I'm not sick anymore.

00:55.386 --> 00:57.754
I know.

00:57.755 --> 00:59.022
You're doing great.

01:10.034 --> 01:12.201
- Here you go, sir.
- You're on a roll, Seth!

01:17.141 --> 01:19.709
Hey, buddy, you're smoking.

01:19.710 --> 01:20.843
I know, right?

01:20.845 --> 01:22.645
I feel great.

01:22.646 --> 01:24.347
No, dude, you're on fire!

01:35.203 --> 01:41.803

01:42.166 --> 01:44.500
- It doesn't exist.
- Yes, it does.

01:44.501 --> 01:47.003
- No, it doesn't.
- Gentlemen!

01:47.004 --> 01:48.738
Working on something rather sensitive,

01:48.739 --> 01:50.173
if you don't mind.

01:52.142 --> 01:54.577
Sorry.

01:54.578 --> 01:57.447
- I'm telling you, yes, it does.
- Don't be stupid, man.

01:57.448 --> 01:59.148
People, don't randomly explode!

01:59.149 --> 02:01.417
- You mean like that?
- Sorry.

02:01.418 --> 02:03.453
Spontaneous human
combustion is a myth, okay?

02:03.454 --> 02:05.254
Reported cases are usually found to be

02:05.256 --> 02:07.757
accidental deaths
caused by a fire nearby.

02:07.758 --> 02:10.926
Usually, not always. Leave a
little room for the unexplainable.

02:10.928 --> 02:12.662
I don't like the unexplainable.

02:12.663 --> 02:14.564
Before we go running
off to South Carolina,

02:14.565 --> 02:16.499
I want to look in
these books and find out

02:16.500 --> 02:18.701
why our amateur golfer
might have burst into flames.

02:18.702 --> 02:21.771
Mr. Jenkins, got any
ideas where we can start?

02:23.073 --> 02:25.108
That's all you got?

02:25.109 --> 02:26.943
There's no magical precedents

02:26.944 --> 02:28.711
for spontaneous human combustion.

02:28.712 --> 02:30.907
When it does happen, which is very rare,

02:30.908 --> 02:32.211
it's usually a quirk of science.

02:32.212 --> 02:33.247
If it's not magic-based,

02:33.248 --> 02:34.751
why would the Clipping Book alert us?

02:34.752 --> 02:37.220
Guess we'll have to go to
Charleston and find out.

02:37.221 --> 02:41.090
- Cass, are you coming?
- Yes! Uh, no.

02:41.091 --> 02:43.626
I mean, I'm gonna go
talk to a friend of mine

02:43.627 --> 02:46.229
at the hospital I used to work
at in New York... Dr. Nassir.

02:46.230 --> 02:48.709
He did a research study on
spontaneous human combustion.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.133
I'll see if he has anything for us.

02:50.134 --> 02:52.335
Great, so Cassandra and
I will head to New York

02:52.336 --> 02:53.856
and you guys can go to South Carolina.

02:53.857 --> 02:55.291
No. I should probably go on my own.

02:55.292 --> 02:56.739
He can be a little touchy.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.741
Eve can't go anyway.

02:58.742 --> 03:01.077
I have a mission of my own
and it takes precedence.

03:01.078 --> 03:03.946
Precedence over people
randomly catching on fire?

03:03.948 --> 03:07.169
I found a code hidden deep
within Charlene's ledgers.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.091
Charlene?

03:08.092 --> 03:10.602
She found a way to let
you know where she is?

03:10.603 --> 03:12.588
No, I think this clue
leads someplace else,

03:12.589 --> 03:15.024
and I don't think it was left for me.

03:15.025 --> 03:19.295
Ebb Tide manufacturing
in Moose Creek, Alaska?

03:19.296 --> 03:20.530
Why Moose Creek?

03:20.531 --> 03:21.831
It's a town just outside

03:21.832 --> 03:23.433
of Fort Wainwright military base

03:23.434 --> 03:24.567
where I lived as a kid.

03:24.568 --> 03:26.803
Ebb Tide Manufacturing?

03:26.804 --> 03:28.671
E-B-B are my initials.

03:28.672 --> 03:31.240
- What's the middle B stand for?
- It stands for

03:31.241 --> 03:33.409
"Better not ask if you like
your face the way it is."

03:33.410 --> 03:35.611
- Wordy.
- This is a clue she left for me.

03:35.612 --> 03:37.980
- What do you think's in Alaska?
- I don't know.

03:37.982 --> 03:39.615
Let's find out.

03:41.986 --> 03:43.780
Jenkins, do you have
that rather sensitive

03:43.781 --> 03:45.084
but important piece of equipment

03:45.085 --> 03:46.322
I asked you to construct?

03:46.323 --> 03:48.224
Yes, sir. I think it will work,

03:48.225 --> 03:50.485
but I have not had
the chance to test it.

03:50.486 --> 03:51.361
Excellent.

03:51.362 --> 03:52.662
Eve, come!

03:52.663 --> 03:54.397
Adventure and mystery await us all.

03:54.398 --> 03:56.399
All right, so now we need three doors.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.770
Charleston, New York, and Alaska?

04:00.771 --> 04:02.305
Three doors.

04:06.410 --> 04:09.045
People leave food day and night.

04:09.046 --> 04:10.513
I keep thinking,

04:10.514 --> 04:12.582
Seth will love this lasagna.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.852
- Then I remember.
- We're very sorry for your loss.

04:15.853 --> 04:19.288
Vitamins, supplements, aromatherapy...

04:19.289 --> 04:21.124
nothing you'd really
call "fire-catchy."

04:21.125 --> 04:23.626
Some might even say
that's unexplainable.

04:23.627 --> 04:28.364
The funny thing was Seth didn't
even need those pills anymore.

04:28.365 --> 04:30.766
He had cancer. Stage four.

04:30.768 --> 04:32.969
He was terminal.

04:32.970 --> 04:35.505
- And he was playing golf?
- He was terminal.

04:35.506 --> 04:38.374
It wasn't until we stopped looking
for a cure that one found us.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.343
What do you mean a cure found you?

04:40.344 --> 04:42.078
We received a brochure in the mail

04:42.079 --> 04:44.480
for a holistic spa retreat.

04:44.481 --> 04:46.516
We went as a last resort.

04:46.517 --> 04:49.519
They healed him.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.122
I have the brochure
around here somewhere.

04:53.123 --> 04:55.691
- Let me get the light.
- Oh, allow me.

04:55.692 --> 04:57.426
Thanks.

05:02.466 --> 05:03.633
Jones, the curtain!

05:13.277 --> 05:15.611
Do you understand what
I just explained to you?

05:15.612 --> 05:18.848
- Cassandra?
- I understand.

05:18.849 --> 05:21.661
I called up to surgery. They've
got a room prepping for us.

05:21.662 --> 05:22.885
If we hurry, we can get you...

05:22.886 --> 05:24.887
I don't want the surgery.

05:24.888 --> 05:28.424
If you don't want the
surgery, what do you want?

05:31.228 --> 05:32.161
Timeline?

05:32.162 --> 05:36.499
Cassandra, there isn't any.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.867
Your tumor is so large

05:37.868 --> 05:40.703
that I'm shocked you could walk in here.

05:40.704 --> 05:43.172
We have to take care of this now.

05:43.173 --> 05:47.543
There's nothing to take care of.

05:47.544 --> 05:50.213
Cassandra.

05:50.214 --> 05:52.315
My home number's on the back.

05:52.316 --> 05:55.318
If you change your mind, call me.

06:00.230 --> 06:03.098
You say ignition was instantaneous?

06:03.099 --> 06:05.267
Man, I'm telling you, she was fine.

06:05.268 --> 06:08.037
And then all of a sudden, yeah.

06:08.038 --> 06:10.072
And then we did this.
We threw it over...

06:10.073 --> 06:12.141
Okay, okay. I get it.

06:14.277 --> 06:15.411
Like this, and then we...

06:17.280 --> 06:21.950
She's back. What'd the doc say?

06:21.952 --> 06:23.519
Your friend, the one who did the study

06:23.520 --> 06:25.020
on spontaneous human combustion.

06:25.021 --> 06:28.690
Nothing. Nothing magicky,

06:28.692 --> 06:30.292
just that it usually occurs

06:30.293 --> 06:31.960
with people with limited mobility,

06:31.962 --> 06:34.096
advanced age, obesity, poor health...

06:34.097 --> 06:35.800
- None of which fit our victims.
- Victims?

06:35.801 --> 06:38.067
Victims? Plural?

06:38.068 --> 06:39.501
You mean there's another
one? There's another victim?

06:39.502 --> 06:41.245
There's been another
spontaneous combustion?

06:41.246 --> 06:42.204
Color me intrigued.

06:42.205 --> 06:43.772
Did someone give you caffeine?

06:43.773 --> 06:45.374
So who is the other victim?

06:45.375 --> 06:46.942
It's the golfer's wife.

06:46.943 --> 06:48.944
Yeah, and he was ill, all right?

06:48.945 --> 06:50.646
And they went to this holistic spa...

06:50.647 --> 06:54.116
- The Vida de la Luz retreat.
- Vida de la Luz.

06:54.117 --> 06:56.085
Man walks in with a terminal illness

06:56.086 --> 06:58.320
and walks out doing wind sprints.

06:58.321 --> 07:01.790
Well, are we waiting for?
We've got librarianing to do.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.459
I'm gonna analyze these further,

07:03.460 --> 07:06.929
see if there are any
biometric clues hiding within.

07:06.930 --> 07:09.198
Well, you guys set the door.

07:09.199 --> 07:12.367
We've got two victims and
a spooky spa to investigate.

07:12.369 --> 07:17.206
- Chop, chop!
- Yeah, somebody gave her caffeine.

07:17.207 --> 07:18.741
If you're looking for a counter-agent

07:18.742 --> 07:20.269
for the effects of caffeine,

07:20.270 --> 07:22.093
I'm afraid I've had no
luck inventing one yet.

07:22.094 --> 07:23.728
I haven't had any caffeine.

07:25.582 --> 07:28.817
In fact, I've never been
clearer in my own mind.

07:28.818 --> 07:31.220
I think we should go to a movie

07:31.221 --> 07:34.156
and dinner... at night.
Tonight. Together.

07:34.157 --> 07:36.825
Wow.

07:36.826 --> 07:38.627
Sounds strangely like a date.

07:38.628 --> 07:40.462
Not strangely. Actually.

07:43.633 --> 07:48.370
What? No. I don't do that.

07:48.371 --> 07:51.106
I'm significantly older than you.

07:51.107 --> 07:54.910
Well, you're significantly
older than everyone, so...

07:54.911 --> 07:57.146
If I were a thousand years younger,

07:57.147 --> 07:59.081
I would still be too old for you.

07:59.082 --> 08:04.146
My immortality, Cassandra, it
practically makes us different species.

08:04.147 --> 08:05.570
I don't think we're that different.

08:05.571 --> 08:07.756
I think we have more
in common than you...

08:07.757 --> 08:09.424
Hey! You coming?

08:09.426 --> 08:11.727
- Yes.
- No.

08:11.728 --> 08:12.928
Yes.

08:22.439 --> 08:25.207
- If I came here, I'd never leave.
- Me neither.

08:29.446 --> 08:32.280
- This place is...
- Not what I expected.

08:32.282 --> 08:33.815
What exactly were you expecting?

08:33.817 --> 08:37.653
Invite only clientele,
remote lush locations, money.

08:37.654 --> 08:39.354
Yet, a single bejeweled choker

08:39.355 --> 08:40.956
or a mirrored Ferrari to be found.

08:40.957 --> 08:43.225
There are no mirrors anywhere here.

08:43.226 --> 08:46.929
Too much contemplation
on your outer self

08:46.930 --> 08:49.164
hides your inner self.

08:49.165 --> 08:52.467
Welcome to La Vida de la Luz retreat.

08:52.469 --> 08:55.337
- Are you the owner?
- My name is on the deed.

08:55.338 --> 08:57.206
I prefer the term caretaker.

08:57.207 --> 09:00.108
I am is Sofia. I run this
place with my children.

09:00.110 --> 09:02.444
Ah, here's one now. Tomas, cariño.

09:02.445 --> 09:04.780
Greetings, friends. Are you guests?

09:04.781 --> 09:06.782
No, we're with the Library.

09:06.783 --> 09:10.919
For the land assessment from the county.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.521
Yeah, we sent a notice last week.

09:12.522 --> 09:15.457
Oh, did a notice come
and you forgot to tell me?

09:15.458 --> 09:17.993
Sorry, madre. I've just been
so busy with all the guests.

09:17.994 --> 09:19.561
I must have forgotten this.

09:19.562 --> 09:22.764
- Hey.
- Is it always this busy here?

09:22.765 --> 09:25.901
Si, people love to come here,
but they don't like to leave.

09:25.902 --> 09:27.636
- Why would they?
- Right?

09:27.637 --> 09:29.304
We have everything we need right here.

09:29.305 --> 09:31.940
Everything? Food, water, clothing?

09:31.941 --> 09:34.610
Natural springs provide
all of our water.

09:34.611 --> 09:38.046
We grow our own produce,
hemp for our clothes, and...

09:38.047 --> 09:41.950
Tomas, it's nearly time
for the sun salutation.

09:41.951 --> 09:44.152
Don't you have a schedule you must keep?

09:44.154 --> 09:46.288
Of course, mama.

09:46.289 --> 09:50.025
It was very nice to
meet you all. Pardon me.

09:50.026 --> 09:52.194
If you want to know about the grounds,

09:52.195 --> 09:54.796
you should talk to my
other child, Estrella.

09:54.797 --> 09:56.999
Now, please, excuse me.

10:00.763 --> 10:03.466
Okay, so they have their own water
source, they grow their own food.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.607
Maybe the cause of the
combusting is environmental.

10:05.608 --> 10:07.309
Yeah, or it's personal.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.413
I mean, Seth and Cece don't
really seem like the type

10:09.414 --> 10:10.712
to randomly ingest something.

10:10.713 --> 10:12.207
Maybe somebody did it to them.

10:12.208 --> 10:14.031
Okay, so, why don't you
guys go talk to staff?

10:14.032 --> 10:15.784
I'll snoop around the grounds.

10:15.785 --> 10:19.988
You don't have to snoop.
I'm happy to show you around.

10:19.989 --> 10:22.157
I'm Estrella, the head gardener.

10:22.158 --> 10:23.525
You're the gardener?

10:23.526 --> 10:25.360
I am.

10:25.361 --> 10:28.463
I also implement
agricultural techniques,

10:28.464 --> 10:30.332
study soil evolution...

10:30.333 --> 10:32.267
the usual bio-geochemical stuff.

10:32.268 --> 10:35.637
So, you could talk to us
about the indigenous plants,

10:35.638 --> 10:38.607
the organic residue
in the soil formation?

10:38.608 --> 10:40.676
I can.

10:40.677 --> 10:44.446
In fact, this is a very rich
area, botanically speaking.

10:44.447 --> 10:47.082
The mineral composition of the
pedosphere is so interesting.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.350
Do you wanna see?

10:48.351 --> 10:51.286
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

10:51.287 --> 10:53.622
- Come, I'll show you.
- Okay.

10:54.891 --> 10:56.725
Unh-uh, unh-uh.

10:56.726 --> 10:59.494
What is that?

10:59.495 --> 11:03.799
Oh, this rock is all over the property.

11:03.800 --> 11:07.269
It's not any soil additive
I've ever worked with before.

11:07.270 --> 11:08.970
But when you get down to the substratum,

11:08.972 --> 11:11.106
you can see the sedimentary deposits.

11:11.107 --> 11:13.809
It makes the earth silty,

11:13.810 --> 11:16.645
which makes growing plants a dream.

11:16.646 --> 11:19.981
Much more fertile than
our last home in Valencia.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.850
Oh, you're from Spain?

11:21.851 --> 11:24.453
Yes, it's wonderful.

11:24.454 --> 11:27.255
I miss it. Have you ever been?

11:27.257 --> 11:29.558
Yeah, we have to deal with that giant...

11:29.559 --> 11:33.829
book return problem there.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.897
What kind of plants do you grow?

11:35.898 --> 11:37.733
Crops, mostly.

11:37.734 --> 11:40.669
Vegetables, some small grains.

11:40.670 --> 11:42.104
- Wow!
- These look good?

11:42.105 --> 11:44.005
They look wonderful!

11:44.007 --> 11:45.273
Put them in the greenhouse.

11:45.275 --> 11:48.710
- Thank you, Marco.
- Excellent.

11:48.711 --> 11:51.813
We even grow kale, which
I personally find awful,

11:51.814 --> 11:54.449
but everyone else loves for some reason.

11:55.918 --> 11:57.953
I love your enthusiasm.

11:57.954 --> 11:59.321
For dirt?

11:59.322 --> 12:01.823
Well, sounds like
it's not just any dirt.

12:01.824 --> 12:05.327
It's not. Not to me.

12:05.328 --> 12:08.730
But it's remarkable
that you can see that,

12:08.731 --> 12:12.434
which tells me that you're not
likely a county grounds assessor.

12:17.807 --> 12:21.476
It's all right. You can tell me.

12:21.477 --> 12:24.413
I understand some people
come here as a last resort.

12:26.683 --> 12:28.316
Yes.

12:29.619 --> 12:32.521
Many people who come here are not well.

12:32.522 --> 12:34.589
Some of them will never get better.

12:34.590 --> 12:36.858
But while they're here,

12:36.859 --> 12:40.262
they can have a quality of life
they could not have elsewhere.

12:40.263 --> 12:45.333
- How?
- Just healthy living.

12:45.335 --> 12:49.304
Good food. Spiritual reflection.

12:49.305 --> 12:52.707
People find peace, and
that makes them better.

12:52.709 --> 12:55.277
But they don't stay better.

12:55.278 --> 12:56.978
That's not peace. That's false hope.

12:56.979 --> 12:59.414
- Not false.
- It's not permanent.

12:59.415 --> 13:01.283
That's just cruel.

13:01.284 --> 13:03.418
I mean, to say that it's healthy living

13:03.419 --> 13:05.153
and that's what's gonna save them?

13:05.154 --> 13:07.422
I mean, how healthy is it
to have people burning up?

13:09.959 --> 13:12.794
Burning up?

13:12.795 --> 13:14.095
What do you mean?

13:14.097 --> 13:18.667
Nothing. I should go find my friends.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.739
So, no odd occurrences, no mishaps,

13:24.741 --> 13:26.741
no accidental poisonings?

13:26.743 --> 13:28.944
We're always very careful
with what we give our guests.

13:28.945 --> 13:31.213
All of our aromatherapy
herbs are edible,

13:31.214 --> 13:33.014
and they're great for calm and focus.

13:33.015 --> 13:35.350
These aren't good enough.
Excuse me a moment.

13:38.221 --> 13:40.255
The zen here is really disconcerting.

13:40.256 --> 13:42.591
Bee balm, calendula, shiso.

13:42.592 --> 13:43.859
We might even be able to
eat some of this stuff,

13:43.860 --> 13:45.360
but why would you want to?

13:45.361 --> 13:47.496
By the way, not a single garlic bulb

13:47.497 --> 13:48.520
or hot pepper to be seen.

13:48.521 --> 13:49.931
Nothing that can make you sweat

13:49.932 --> 13:51.433
or spontaneously combust.

13:51.434 --> 13:53.235
There's still something
that doesn't add up.

13:53.236 --> 13:55.604
Something just seems a little odd.

14:06.082 --> 14:07.916
- Stone.
- What?

14:07.917 --> 14:09.317
What do you see in that door?

14:10.787 --> 14:12.687
My reflection.

14:12.688 --> 14:14.656
And what don't you see?

14:21.964 --> 14:26.434
Jenkins, I think I know why these people
have been catching fire in the sun.

14:26.436 --> 14:28.203
Yes, so do I.

14:28.204 --> 14:31.640
The Charleston victims'
ashes aren't human.

14:31.641 --> 14:35.410
They're vampire.

14:35.411 --> 14:37.212
I don't like vampires.

14:38.569 --> 14:42.038
You can see that the vampire
ashes are microbially hexagonal.

14:42.039 --> 14:45.275
I can't identify the
crystalline structure, though.

14:45.276 --> 14:48.011
- Stakes and crosses.
- Holy Bible and garlic.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.380
We forgetting anything?

14:50.381 --> 14:52.549
Hey, Jenkins, do we have any holy water?

14:52.550 --> 14:54.985
Yes, of course. The swimming
pool is blessed regularly.

14:54.986 --> 14:57.654
All right, we don't even know
if this stuff is gonna work

14:57.655 --> 14:59.522
with vampires that walk in the daylight.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.658
Oh, yeah.

15:01.659 --> 15:04.027
Working right out there in
the sun. One of them had a tan.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.029
There's probably more than one.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.798
I accidentally let slip to
Estrella about the combusting.

15:08.799 --> 15:11.534
- You let it slip?
- And judging by her reaction,

15:11.535 --> 15:12.936
she knew what I was talking about.

15:12.937 --> 15:14.671
Which means she's a fanger,

15:14.672 --> 15:16.806
just like our amateur
golfer and his wife.

15:16.807 --> 15:18.308
Jenkins, we're gonna need

15:18.309 --> 15:21.044
all the water in the swimming pool.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.713
Okay, hold on, why don't we
just figure out what's going on

15:23.714 --> 15:26.483
before we start sticking
people with pointy things?

15:26.484 --> 15:27.817
But... vampires.

15:27.818 --> 15:30.854
Who are trapped in their
existence just like you...

15:30.855 --> 15:32.689
or me.

15:32.690 --> 15:36.860
Did you know that Mr. Carsen
was in love with one once?

15:36.861 --> 15:39.429
There could very well be
more here than meets the eye.

15:39.430 --> 15:40.830
I agree with Ms. Cillian.

15:44.802 --> 15:47.604
Vampire lore is in the
European literature wing.

15:47.605 --> 15:51.141
Maybe we can find some precedents
on vampires that can tan.

15:51.142 --> 15:54.577
So, Flynn was in love with a vampire?

15:54.578 --> 15:58.148
Yes, she helped him defeat Vlad Dracul.

15:58.149 --> 15:59.783
The relationship did not last very long,

15:59.784 --> 16:02.552
but I understand she was
an exceptional person.

16:02.553 --> 16:05.121
I see. So the fact that she was immortal

16:05.122 --> 16:07.524
and Flynn wasn't didn't stop them.

16:11.996 --> 16:16.733
Cassandra, there are
things you don't understand.

16:16.734 --> 16:20.003
No, I fully understand.

16:20.004 --> 16:21.704
It's not because we're
different species.

16:21.705 --> 16:22.939
It's because I'm gonna die.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.311
- No.
- Some day.

16:24.312 --> 16:26.503
You're afraid to start something
because you're afraid to get hurt,

16:26.504 --> 16:27.847
and that just makes you a coward.

16:27.848 --> 16:29.379
Please, you're angry and...

16:29.380 --> 16:32.649
Yeah, because you have all of this life

16:32.650 --> 16:34.284
and you don't do anything with it.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.486
Do you know what I would give for that?

16:36.487 --> 16:39.389
You think I haven't lived?
You think I haven't loved?

16:39.390 --> 16:42.158
There was a woman in whose eyes

16:42.159 --> 16:45.462
I saw the sun rise and set every day.

16:45.463 --> 16:48.865
Whose soul was the
most brilliantly perfect

16:48.866 --> 16:52.068
of any I had ever seen.

16:52.069 --> 16:54.838
You hadn't mentioned her before.

16:54.839 --> 16:57.273
She did not choose me.

16:57.274 --> 16:58.641
She chose another.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.744
But I had already
pledged my heart to her

17:01.746 --> 17:03.012
for all of the eternity,

17:03.014 --> 17:06.648
and a knight can never break an oath.

17:09.653 --> 17:13.256
Cassandra, you are beautiful,

17:13.257 --> 17:14.991
and you will find your love some day,

17:14.992 --> 17:18.361
but it just cannot be me.

17:23.267 --> 17:25.801
- Are we close?
- Oh, I hope so.

17:25.803 --> 17:27.971
I don't think I can
take another bug bite.

17:27.972 --> 17:29.332
Flynn, if you don't like hiking,

17:29.333 --> 17:30.556
why did you bring me out here?

17:30.557 --> 17:31.908
I didn't bring you out here.

17:31.909 --> 17:33.652
The clue in the ledger
brought you out here.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.971
No, you did.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.915
Charlene didn't know the
name of the Alaskan town

17:36.916 --> 17:38.314
I lived in as a kid. You did.

17:38.315 --> 17:40.176
You've been secretive, evasive,

17:40.177 --> 17:41.560
you tore a page out of the ledger.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.552
You, the Librarian,

17:42.553 --> 17:44.120
destroying a book! So tell me,

17:44.121 --> 17:45.488
why did you drag me out

17:45.489 --> 17:47.957
to the middle of the Alaskan forest?

17:47.958 --> 17:50.226
All right, the reason that
I brought you out here is...

18:04.442 --> 18:05.942
There's more.

18:10.648 --> 18:11.881
Never mind.

18:13.517 --> 18:15.218
It's beautiful.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.287
Well, I promised you a vacation.

18:17.288 --> 18:19.822
I know that I've been a
little distracted lately,

18:19.824 --> 18:22.158
and you've been very patient.

18:22.159 --> 18:23.993
"Saintly" might be the word I'd use.

18:23.994 --> 18:28.164
Well, Saint Eve, I didn't
want another moment to go by

18:28.165 --> 18:30.567
without telling you
how much you mean to me.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.403
And I thought a little romantic meal

18:33.404 --> 18:35.989
in a romantic setting,
and maybe a little hike...

18:35.990 --> 18:37.373
that hike, why do you like hiking?

18:37.374 --> 18:39.409
- Hiking is terrible.
- So you lied to me

18:39.410 --> 18:41.711
and misled me just to take me on a date.

18:41.712 --> 18:44.747
Yeah, if you're gonna put it like that.

18:50.654 --> 18:52.589
I love it.

19:01.499 --> 19:04.394
Look at them working
out here in the sun.

19:04.395 --> 19:05.698
You wouldn't know what they are.

19:05.699 --> 19:08.534
We don't know what they are. Not yet.

19:11.342 --> 19:14.344
Which is why I'm not taking any chances.

19:14.345 --> 19:17.780
Hi, um, Sofia, this is awkward.

19:17.781 --> 19:22.952
- We were wondering...
- You're wondering if we are vampires.

19:22.953 --> 19:27.890
And I was wondering if it was really
that county that sent you, Librarians.

19:29.493 --> 19:31.628
Would you like some lemonade?

19:31.629 --> 19:35.531
My family and I came here
from Valencia many years ago.

19:35.533 --> 19:37.066
I was exhausted.

19:37.067 --> 19:38.801
I'd been alive for centuries.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.471
This was the most beautiful
place I've ever seen.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.373
I wanted to meet my last dawn here.

19:43.374 --> 19:48.411
So we swam in the
pond, counted the stars.

19:48.412 --> 19:51.014
I said good-bye to my children

19:51.015 --> 19:52.582
and waited for the sun.

19:52.583 --> 19:57.053
- But the end never came.
- I was so angry.

19:57.054 --> 20:00.857
Then I realized I was spared
so I can find this place

20:00.858 --> 20:03.526
that lets us walk in the sun.

20:03.527 --> 20:06.029
I had to use it for good.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.064
We don't know how it works,

20:08.065 --> 20:11.167
but we know that it only does
when we're on the grounds,

20:11.168 --> 20:13.002
so we built a sanctuary.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.537
Not just for our kind.

20:14.538 --> 20:16.873
So everyone that works
here is a vampire?

20:19.109 --> 20:20.843
What about the guests? What are they?

20:20.844 --> 20:23.246
Food! I'm guessing.

20:23.247 --> 20:26.316
Nunca. If they're sick, our
blood helps them get better.

20:26.317 --> 20:28.284
We just take a little in trade.

20:28.285 --> 20:31.587
We haven't killed anyone
since we set foot on this land.

20:31.589 --> 20:33.489
What about Seth from Charleston?

20:33.490 --> 20:35.992
He came here, got turned,

20:35.993 --> 20:38.695
went home, and a week later
he was burning in the sun.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.997
A week?

20:40.998 --> 20:42.432
That's impossible.

20:42.433 --> 20:44.467
We don't turn people.

20:44.468 --> 20:47.837
If we did, they would have
to stay here in the spa.

20:47.838 --> 20:49.739
If we leave the grounds,

20:49.740 --> 20:52.408
we revert to darkness dwellers.

20:52.409 --> 20:55.545
Okay, then why did they
last so long in Charleston?

20:55.546 --> 20:59.015
You will have full access to everyone.

20:59.016 --> 21:01.918
I want to know how this
happened as much as you do.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.721
You can start with me.

21:04.722 --> 21:08.291
I don't know who could be doing this.

21:08.292 --> 21:11.828
I thought everyone was happy here.

21:11.829 --> 21:15.598
I mean, I admit that I
sometimes miss the outside world.

21:15.599 --> 21:19.435
But this place, it's protected.

21:19.436 --> 21:23.773
It's our home, like your
Library protects you.

21:23.774 --> 21:27.143
You're gonna miss it, aren't you?

21:27.144 --> 21:30.279
The Library? Your friends?

21:32.249 --> 21:36.419
I've spent five decades with people
who are facing their final days.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.288
You have the same look in your eyes,

21:39.290 --> 21:42.558
the same hunger to keep going.

21:46.230 --> 21:48.698
This was Seth's spiritual and holistic

21:48.699 --> 21:50.533
daily treatment regime while he was here

21:50.534 --> 21:53.603
- and everyone he worked with.
- What about his wife Cece?

21:53.604 --> 21:56.672
She wasn't here for therapy,
so her days weren't structured.

21:56.674 --> 21:59.041
Seth was assigned to
the composting team.

21:59.043 --> 22:01.644
I'd start with that. Good luck.

22:03.414 --> 22:04.981
Have fun at the composting pile, mate.

22:04.982 --> 22:06.249
Wait, where are you going?

22:06.250 --> 22:08.351
- The spa.
- No.

22:08.352 --> 22:11.287
Which is where I'm guessing Cece
spent most of her unstructured time.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.688
Also, I'm in need of a manicure.

22:17.261 --> 22:19.762
Let's go. Come on, come on.

22:36.113 --> 22:37.980
Milkweed?

22:37.981 --> 22:40.116
Pollen, soil from the east garden,

22:40.117 --> 22:41.751
soil from the west garden.

22:41.752 --> 22:44.187
It's like they're taking
the entire spa retreat

22:44.188 --> 22:46.155
and putting into individual bottles.

22:47.024 --> 22:49.125
Hey, Jones,

22:49.126 --> 22:51.494
this stuff is all over the grounds.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.429
Why do you have a gem loupe?

22:53.430 --> 22:55.465
Why wouldn't I have a gem loupe?

22:55.466 --> 22:57.567
This stuff looks like Amora.

22:57.568 --> 23:00.903
- Amora? You mean, moissanite?
- Uh-huh.

23:00.904 --> 23:02.405
The silicon carbide found

23:02.406 --> 23:06.309
in the meteor rocks by
Henry Moissan in 1893.

23:06.310 --> 23:08.678
Synthetic moissanite is
used as a diamond substitute.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.702
It looks pretty much the
same, it's just as strong.

23:10.703 --> 23:12.782
Also, it's really sparkly.

23:12.783 --> 23:14.417
But this real stuff is super rare.

23:14.418 --> 23:16.219
Wait a minute. Jenkins said he found

23:16.220 --> 23:18.821
crystalline particles in the ashes.

23:18.822 --> 23:20.982
I doubt there's been a lot
of studies of how moissanite

23:20.984 --> 23:22.718
affects vampires' sun aversion, but...

23:22.719 --> 23:24.727
- I think they're doing one now.
- Boy.

23:24.728 --> 23:26.929
I don't care if they are Librarians.

23:26.930 --> 23:29.165
We are too close to shut down now.

23:30.768 --> 23:33.436
No one's ever made it 20 minutes
outside the grounds before?

23:33.437 --> 23:35.872
The last two survived a week on this.

23:39.076 --> 23:40.643
Okay. Fine.

23:40.644 --> 23:42.512
I'll shut it down.

23:42.513 --> 23:46.215
But as soon as they are gone,
we break past these walls.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.751
I didn't follow you to suffocate here.

23:50.921 --> 23:54.023
Soon, the world will know us.

23:54.024 --> 23:56.560
And they will all bow down.

23:59.696 --> 24:02.765
It's called an oligodendroglioma.

24:02.766 --> 24:05.534
I've known for half of my
life that I was gonna die.

24:05.535 --> 24:09.004
Just didn't think it would be this soon.

24:09.006 --> 24:12.675
I always thought that when
the time came I'd be ready.

24:12.676 --> 24:15.377
Turns out you're never ready.

24:15.379 --> 24:17.480
- I would give anything...
- Oh, yes.

24:20.050 --> 24:23.452
Last time we spoke, you were
at the anger stage of grief.

24:23.453 --> 24:25.788
Now you've moved to bargaining.

24:26.489 --> 24:28.423
You can't really bargain with a tumor.

24:31.994 --> 24:33.762
So what if...

24:36.099 --> 24:38.400
it could remain a part of you...

24:38.401 --> 24:41.436
...but you could go on living?

24:41.437 --> 24:42.704
Who's bargaining now?

24:46.943 --> 24:48.810
No...

24:48.811 --> 24:52.013
I'm out of options.

24:52.014 --> 24:54.416
Conventional options.

24:54.417 --> 24:58.253
We don't turn people often.

24:58.254 --> 25:00.155
In fact, I've turned anyone before.

25:00.156 --> 25:04.059
But you, you deserve more time.

25:04.060 --> 25:08.697
As a... as one of you?

25:10.900 --> 25:13.068
So I'd be immortal?

25:13.069 --> 25:15.370
You'd never age.

25:15.371 --> 25:16.838
Never get sick again.

25:16.839 --> 25:20.041
Your friends wouldn't
have to say good-bye.

25:20.042 --> 25:21.643
I haven't told them...

25:23.613 --> 25:25.647
that I'm...

25:27.183 --> 25:28.950
running out of time.

25:28.951 --> 25:33.121
You don't have to be out of time.

25:33.122 --> 25:35.690
You could stay here.

25:35.691 --> 25:37.559
With me, together.

25:50.973 --> 25:53.708
Dr. Nassir. Neurosurgery.

25:59.048 --> 26:00.849
- Oh!
- Where have you been?

26:00.850 --> 26:04.080
I was at the pond with
Estrella. Interviewing her.

26:04.081 --> 26:06.904
Oh, how nice for you two. While you
two are enjoying your nature trail,

26:06.905 --> 26:10.358
me and this guy are trying to figure
out how Seth and Cece got flambéed.

26:10.359 --> 26:13.895
Shh. We found a secret lab
underneath the spa, okay.

26:13.896 --> 26:15.931
Somebody's been testing
the components of the land.

26:15.932 --> 26:18.366
They're trying to come
up with a little formula

26:18.367 --> 26:20.470
so these vampires can day
walk anywhere they want to.

26:20.471 --> 26:21.369
Give me the rock.

26:21.370 --> 26:23.538
These little crystal flecks? Moissanite.

26:23.539 --> 26:27.342
This is the rock that Estrella
said made the soil so rich.

26:27.343 --> 26:29.377
It's all around the
pond. It's in the ground.

26:29.378 --> 26:30.045
Yeah.

26:30.046 --> 26:32.047
Which means a meteor
must have crashed here,

26:32.048 --> 26:36.217
caused the water formations and, oops,
accidentally protected vampires from the sun.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.453
We heard Marco talking, okay?

26:38.454 --> 26:40.622
They used Seth and
Cece as an experiment.

26:40.623 --> 26:42.891
They turned them, pumped
them full of that rock,

26:42.892 --> 26:44.326
and sent them out in
the world to be barbecued

26:44.327 --> 26:45.867
to see if their little formula works.

26:45.868 --> 26:47.669
- Who was Marco talking to?
- I don't know.

26:47.670 --> 26:50.131
But it was somebody in charge... Sofia,

26:50.132 --> 26:52.466
- Tomas.
- Estrella.

26:52.467 --> 26:53.051
No.

26:53.052 --> 26:54.635
Yeah. She's the one that knows the land.

26:54.636 --> 26:56.237
She's a bio-geochemical engineer.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.706
It wasn't Estrella.

26:57.707 --> 26:59.708
Okay. Let's go talk to her, then.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.811
No. Just me.

27:02.812 --> 27:05.580
Not you two and your preconceived
notions about vampires.

27:11.954 --> 27:13.455
Did you make a decision?

27:13.456 --> 27:15.557
Estrella, do you know what this is?

27:15.558 --> 27:18.693
Yes. I told you.

27:18.694 --> 27:21.162
It's found all over the property.

27:21.163 --> 27:25.033
The piece of a meteor, and it's what
allows you to walk during the day.

27:25.034 --> 27:27.702
Someone here is trying to
isolate the daywalking properties

27:27.703 --> 27:30.905
and they're using guests like
Seth and Cece as test subjects.

27:30.907 --> 27:33.942
You think I did this?

27:33.943 --> 27:37.038
No.

27:37.039 --> 27:39.982
But I'd be surprised if you didn't
know about the moissanite's properties.

27:39.983 --> 27:43.785
You are too smart not
to have been curious.

27:43.786 --> 27:45.487
I had a theory.

27:45.488 --> 27:47.389
Who did you share the theory with?

27:47.390 --> 27:50.258
I have to talk to my mother.

27:55.731 --> 27:59.334
Excuse me. I need to
speak with Dr. Nassir.

27:59.335 --> 28:03.004
Um, Cassandra Cillian came in
earlier to have an appointment with...

28:03.005 --> 28:05.974
Excuse me. Did you
say Cassandra Cillian?

28:05.975 --> 28:08.843
I did, Dr. Nassir?

28:08.844 --> 28:10.945
Are you family?

28:10.947 --> 28:13.581
Yes. Cassandra is my family.

28:16.385 --> 28:18.353
I was just about to
reach out to her again.

28:18.354 --> 28:20.221
I haven't heard from Ms. Cillian

28:20.222 --> 28:23.625
since we got the results from the scans.

28:23.626 --> 28:25.393
Scans...

28:25.394 --> 28:27.996
Mama?

28:27.997 --> 28:30.017
- This is not what you think.
- We just got here.

28:30.833 --> 28:31.733
Mama.

28:32.935 --> 28:34.769
Mama?

28:37.573 --> 28:39.174
You did this.

28:52.722 --> 28:55.550
They didn't do this. They
couldn't have. It's not what we do.

28:55.551 --> 28:58.694
Yeah. We were here to ask your mother
about the secret underground vampire lab.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.195
The one we saw your herbalist in.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.090
Where's Marco?

29:02.091 --> 29:04.674
These Librarians are just trying
to make us question what we saw.

29:04.675 --> 29:06.234
You don't know what you saw.

29:06.235 --> 29:07.869
We didn't come here to hurt anyone.

29:07.870 --> 29:09.737
Oh, no? Then what's this?

29:11.741 --> 29:14.375
- Hmm?
- Dude, why would you bring a sword?

29:14.377 --> 29:16.320
- Why wouldn't I bring a sword?
- Shut up!

29:16.321 --> 29:17.312
You killed our mother?

29:17.313 --> 29:18.813
They all did.

29:18.814 --> 29:21.216
No. She was with me most of the time.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.750
It wasn't her.

29:22.752 --> 29:25.186
Estrella. We didn't do his. Please.

29:25.187 --> 29:26.421
You have to believe me.

29:26.422 --> 29:28.323
Let me prove it to you.

29:28.324 --> 29:30.919
- How?
- The secret lab.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.663
If it's there, then
we're telling the truth.

29:32.664 --> 29:34.496
Yeah. It's built into the hillside,

29:34.497 --> 29:35.897
just past the zen garden.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.834
If there's no secret lab, we'll know.

29:39.835 --> 29:40.902
We could show you.

29:40.903 --> 29:42.670
No. Not you.

29:42.671 --> 29:43.571
I don't trust you.

29:43.572 --> 29:45.340
You. Come on, let's go.

29:50.479 --> 29:52.780
When we're done, take
them outside and kill them.

29:55.518 --> 29:57.352
This is a waste of time, Estrella.

29:57.353 --> 29:59.096
Even if there is a
secret lab under the spa,

29:59.097 --> 30:00.648
that doesn't mean they didn't do it.

30:00.649 --> 30:03.072
Look, someone is trying to crack
the secret of the moissanite

30:03.073 --> 30:05.293
to allow you to day
walk outside the retreat.

30:05.294 --> 30:07.962
What they haven't figured out
yet is that grinding down the rock

30:07.963 --> 30:10.865
and isolating the particles
and ingesting them isn't enough.

30:11.967 --> 30:13.601
Not by itself.

30:13.602 --> 30:15.603
Wha... what do you
mean? What is it, then?

30:22.645 --> 30:27.382
We haven't had a proper
kill in quite a while.

30:27.383 --> 30:29.651
I'm going to really enjoy this.

30:29.652 --> 30:32.654
Please tell me you have a plan.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.355
Yes, I do.

30:34.356 --> 30:36.291
Does it involve punching and kicking?

30:37.693 --> 30:39.394
Yes, it does.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.767
Never tie up a thief.

30:49.638 --> 30:51.439
- Here, come on.
- Untie it, untie it.

30:54.810 --> 30:56.511
It's the water.

30:58.180 --> 31:00.949
Over the years, the water's
been infused by the moissanite.

31:00.950 --> 31:03.051
You drink it, you grow
your crops with it.

31:03.052 --> 31:05.119
You bathe in it.

31:05.121 --> 31:10.024
The microscopic granules from the
rock have formed a protective coating

31:10.025 --> 31:11.359
that's bonded to your bodies.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.201
That protective coating
reflects all of the

31:20.202 --> 31:21.869
electromagnetic radiation from the sun.

31:21.871 --> 31:24.539
4,000 granules per micro liter of water

31:24.540 --> 31:26.441
reflects 93 lumens per watt.

31:28.144 --> 31:30.345
The effects would only last 7 days.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.447
They wear off without
continued exposure.

31:35.918 --> 31:37.919
It's the water, not the rock.

31:37.920 --> 31:40.355
No, no. It can't be that simple.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.259
- Did you try the moissanite on its own?
- Yes, Yes. We tried everything.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.328
- What?
- And...

31:47.229 --> 31:48.463
Oh, my God.

31:50.166 --> 31:52.267
It was you.

31:52.268 --> 31:54.102
Estrella, listen to me.

31:54.103 --> 31:55.470
- Estrella, por favor.
- No. No.

31:55.471 --> 31:56.938
- Estrella, Estrella.
- No.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.812
These guys are too fast.
I can't do this on my own.

32:04.813 --> 32:07.348
- You got me.
- Glad you feel that way.

32:09.018 --> 32:10.652
Wait! No, no, no!

32:21.864 --> 32:22.580
No, no.

32:22.581 --> 32:24.732
Por favor, listen to
me, Estrella, Estrella!

32:24.733 --> 32:26.901
I won't.

32:28.204 --> 32:30.138
You killed our mother?

32:30.139 --> 32:31.506
We were happy here.

32:31.507 --> 32:33.741
We didn't have to worry about hunting

32:33.742 --> 32:35.176
or being hunted.

32:35.177 --> 32:37.812
It's in our nature to hunt, Estrella.

32:37.813 --> 32:39.814
Mama wanted us to deny all that,

32:39.815 --> 32:42.183
to stay here and
meditate on the same lawn,

32:42.184 --> 32:46.421
smiling every day, helping these people.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.656
This Librarian doesn't understand.

32:50.226 --> 32:51.793
I did this for us, Estrella.

32:51.794 --> 32:53.294
Don't you miss it?

32:53.295 --> 32:55.463
The world? We can leave here now.

32:55.464 --> 32:57.465
We can be who we were
always meant to be.

32:57.466 --> 33:00.601
I am who I was meant to be.

33:07.142 --> 33:09.544
Time to taste Librarian.

33:18.721 --> 33:19.854
Jenkins!

33:53.122 --> 33:54.789
Where's Cassandra?

34:07.236 --> 34:10.237
Careful, hermana. I'm
more powerful than you.

34:10.239 --> 34:14.007
I've actually had a meal
in the last 50 years.

34:14.009 --> 34:15.842
You don't know power.

34:30.092 --> 34:32.360
Ah!

34:33.495 --> 34:35.429
Little girl.

34:35.431 --> 34:37.665
You thought you could
drive that through my heart?

34:37.666 --> 34:39.600
No.

34:39.601 --> 34:41.335
Then, what are you
gonna do with it, huh?

34:41.337 --> 34:44.205
Give it to your sister.

34:55.585 --> 34:57.018
I love you, Tomas.

35:03.125 --> 35:06.027
- Estrella.
- Cassandra.

35:06.028 --> 35:08.430
- Cassandra?
- Step aside.

35:08.431 --> 35:09.998
She needs a hospital, now!

35:19.960 --> 35:22.395
You are so beautiful.

35:22.396 --> 35:24.363
Uh-huh.

35:24.364 --> 35:27.833
When the Library selected
you, it chose wisely.

35:27.835 --> 35:30.136
Okay. I don't want to do this anymore.

35:30.137 --> 35:32.538
I don't want the candles and champagne.

35:32.539 --> 35:33.673
I don't want this vacation.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.107
I just want the truth.

35:35.108 --> 35:37.076
- Eve, I...
- Out with it, Flynn.

35:37.077 --> 35:38.778
If you're leaving again, just tell me.

35:38.779 --> 35:40.680
If it's something else, just tell me.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.581
I'm tired of the secrets.

35:42.583 --> 35:44.784
All right.

35:46.253 --> 35:47.853
Yeah.

35:47.855 --> 35:49.598
There is something that...

35:49.599 --> 35:51.500
...I can to tell you.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.494
We have to get home.

35:55.495 --> 35:56.796
It's Cassandra.

35:56.797 --> 35:58.531
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

35:58.532 --> 36:01.033
I can process Euler's
Formula for Polyhedra,

36:01.034 --> 36:02.668
but I couldn't process this.

36:02.669 --> 36:06.072
No need to apologize, and
don't you ever lie to me again.

36:06.073 --> 36:08.240
I mean, even if I survive the surgery,

36:08.242 --> 36:10.042
I don't know who I am without this.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.811
It's what made me a Librarian.

36:11.812 --> 36:13.813
No, it did not make you a Librarian.

36:13.814 --> 36:17.049
The Library did, and it
didn't choose a tumor.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.851
It chose a person.

36:18.852 --> 36:21.020
Someone who I love very much.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.956
It's time.

37:06.500 --> 37:09.301
I don't know why I play
this stupid Sudoku anyway.

37:09.303 --> 37:11.904
I'm trying to get these
last numbers for hours.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.818
Surgery was intense.

37:25.819 --> 37:28.154
The tumor was deeply entrenched.

37:30.290 --> 37:35.194
Doctor, just tell us. Is Cassandra...?

38:14.468 --> 38:16.502
Hey, you're awake.

38:18.538 --> 38:19.805
Good to have you back, kid.

38:19.806 --> 38:21.941
I'm not back.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.712
I mean, without the tumor,
am I even a Librarian?

38:26.713 --> 38:28.414
Oh, pish-posh. None of us have tumors.

38:28.415 --> 38:29.949
We're all Librarians.

38:40.293 --> 38:42.361
You okay?

38:45.832 --> 38:48.934
You with the family now.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.603
And you are a Librarian.

38:50.604 --> 38:53.105
Gift or no gift.

38:56.877 --> 39:01.480
1-7-3. I can't do this Sudoku.

39:07.521 --> 39:09.955
3-6-7.

39:13.693 --> 39:16.829
3-6-7.

39:16.830 --> 39:18.831
That's it. I figured it out.

39:18.832 --> 39:21.000
How did I figure it out?

39:24.304 --> 39:26.138
Um, guys...

39:30.710 --> 39:33.512
About that no-gift thing...

39:43.223 --> 39:45.357
Congratulations.

39:45.358 --> 39:48.327
They said your surgery
was a complete success.

39:48.328 --> 39:50.429
Incredibly.

40:01.475 --> 40:04.977
When you collapsed and
your friends rushed you off,

40:04.978 --> 40:06.345
I didn't know what to think.

40:06.346 --> 40:10.082
I was so glad when I
heard you were okay.

40:10.083 --> 40:12.251
You're part of the reason that I am.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.554
You reminded me

40:15.555 --> 40:19.625
that what defines us
isn't what we're born into.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.727
It's what we choose to be.

40:21.728 --> 40:24.096
If you ever change your mind

40:24.097 --> 40:27.800
and decide you want a
little bit of immortality,

40:27.801 --> 40:29.635
this is where I'll be.

40:29.636 --> 40:34.907
I think, ultimately, it
wasn't the right choice for me.

40:37.043 --> 40:39.912
But you have to know
how much the offer meant.

40:40.747 --> 40:43.082
You helped save my life.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.184
I will never forget that.

40:59.466 --> 41:02.635
I hope I'll see you again...

41:02.636 --> 41:04.525
Cassandra Cillian.
