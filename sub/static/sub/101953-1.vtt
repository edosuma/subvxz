00:27.736 --> 00:28.902
Marlee, come on.
Get in the cart.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.204
- I left the damn skillet.
- It doesn't matter. Leave it.

00:31.206 --> 00:32.604
You won't be saying that
at breakfast.

00:32.607 --> 00:34.841
- Water's rising too fast.
- I know where it is.

00:34.843 --> 00:36.342
- I'll be quick.
- No!

00:36.344 --> 00:37.077
Dad, the water.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.611
It's alright, darling.

00:38.613 --> 00:40.847
Your mother knows what she's
doing. She won't be long.

00:40.849 --> 00:42.682
Jarah, stay here.
I'm going for your ma.

00:42.684 --> 00:44.818
Jarah, do as I tell you.
Stay here.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.486
I won't be long, OK?

00:46.488 --> 00:48.722
I love you.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.987
Ah!

01:53.989 --> 01:57.557
Father Patrick says
kissing is the devil's work.

01:57.559 --> 02:00.093
- It is.
- Until you're 21.

02:00.095 --> 02:01.961
I'll never be that old.

02:01.963 --> 02:05.698
Not if you stay cheeky.

03:49.204 --> 03:52.238
Let us begin.

03:53.541 --> 03:54.374
Paddy.

03:54.376 --> 03:58.511
We'd like to have a word
with your, uh... flock.

03:58.513 --> 04:02.515
We're about to begin
our service, Mr Wilson.

04:02.517 --> 04:05.685
Mayor. It's Mayor Wilson.

04:05.687 --> 04:09.188
Sister.

04:14.329 --> 04:19.065
Government's decided you're
to become wards of the state.

04:19.067 --> 04:22.802
Means government decides
what's best for you.

04:22.804 --> 04:26.372
These are grown people.
They can care for themselves.

04:26.374 --> 04:28.708
Powers that be disagree.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.917
These mission lands
are to be reclaimed.

04:37.919 --> 04:40.119
You can't do that.

04:40.121 --> 04:41.587
Already done.

04:42.724 --> 04:44.724
You and your children

04:44.726 --> 04:46.693
will be reassigned
to properties

04:46.695 --> 04:48.294
where help is needed.

04:49.597 --> 04:52.432
Postings
are all nearby.

04:52.434 --> 04:55.368
My wife needs a seamstress.

04:55.370 --> 04:57.637
We just live
around the corner.

04:58.707 --> 04:59.672
This is...

04:59.674 --> 05:02.108
I'm gonna alert the church
superiors about this.

05:02.110 --> 05:04.477
I am your superior.

05:04.479 --> 05:07.981
You will bend the knee,
my son.

05:09.084 --> 05:12.852
Sister, if you could
assemble the children.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.154
- Of course.
- No!

05:17.559 --> 05:21.561
They go soft or hard,
either way.

05:22.263 --> 05:23.896
You decide.

05:26.501 --> 05:27.734
Good girl.

05:27.736 --> 05:30.269
Now, don't worry,
little chickens.

05:30.271 --> 05:32.405
We're going to have
a lovely picnic.

05:32.407 --> 05:35.375
There'll be swimming
and tea and cakes.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.644
Alright. You go with them,
alright?

05:38.646 --> 05:42.081
And you do what they say. Your
dad and I will come find you.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.550
Alright? Now, listen to me.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.953
You be good. No cheeky.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.354
Be quiet, invisible.

05:48.356 --> 05:51.190
Alright? You do what they say
and they won't hurt you.

05:51.192 --> 05:53.893
Your dad and I will
come find you, I promise.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.728
I promise.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.597
I promise we'll come find you.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.565
We'll come find you.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.200
We'll come find you.

Yeah, come on.

08:57.111 --> 08:59.812

- Yeah, you'll manage.

08:59.814 --> 09:02.748
Take me. I'd like to see.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.017
Yeah, I know you would.

09:05.019 --> 09:07.720
But this is just for
my special girl.

09:08.122 --> 09:11.424
Come on, you'll like it.
Promise.

09:18.299 --> 09:19.665
Paddy's coming home.

09:19.667 --> 09:23.836
Go wash up
and clean out the storeroom.

09:23.838 --> 09:25.771
Yes, Da.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.842
Grumpy old Da!

09:53.501 --> 09:55.868
Haven't you learnt
your lesson?

09:55.870 --> 09:58.271
You have to let her go.

09:58.273 --> 09:59.505
Where is she?

09:59.507 --> 10:01.674
That's no longer your concern.

10:01.676 --> 10:03.409
Where is my daughter?

10:03.411 --> 10:08.147
I'd hate to see you being
punished by Jackson again.

10:09.250 --> 10:13.819
She's with people who love
her, being properly cared for.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.122
What's that?

10:18.593 --> 10:20.393
Where'd it come from?

10:20.395 --> 10:21.794
It's mine.

10:21.796 --> 10:25.398
Sure is pretty. Just like you.

10:26.968 --> 10:28.901
Real pretty.

10:29.537 --> 10:33.973
Think I might get a bit more
dirty before I clean up.

10:35.576 --> 10:38.978
Go see if Pam needs help
with dinner.

10:39.314 --> 10:41.947
- Said she needs yours.
- Binda...

10:42.417 --> 10:44.684
You tell the boys
I'll be there in 10.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.186
Tell Pam she'll be
a while after.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.221
Go on.

And send for your brother.

22:56.383 --> 22:58.383

23:02.256 --> 23:04.456
He killed my son.

27:47.641 --> 27:50.275

28:12.199 --> 28:14.366
I don't think she knows,
Mr Mackay.

28:14.368 --> 28:17.068
It's not really
the point, mate.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.604
Bushy here's a black tracker.

28:19.606 --> 28:21.439
He'll find him within a month.

28:21.441 --> 28:24.209
She'll draw him in alright.

28:24.211 --> 28:26.644
We're just poisoning the well.

28:26.646 --> 28:30.148
- Ohh!
- Man's gonna die of thirst.

28:30.150 --> 28:33.418
- Fuckin' sweet as.
- Isn't she?

28:33.420 --> 28:37.222
- Shamus, I'm up.
- Uh, Bushy.

28:37.224 --> 28:40.425
- You want a go?
- Yeah, why not?

28:46.233 --> 28:47.866
What about
the other boongs?

28:47.868 --> 28:50.568
Hold that for me, sweetheart.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.571
I trust your judgement,
Mr Mackay.

28:53.573 --> 28:56.107
Good answer, boy.

28:58.011 --> 28:59.911
Oh!

28:59.913 --> 29:01.780
Constable!

29:02.783 --> 29:04.883
Constable Neale!

29:08.722 --> 29:10.622
Your brother, wasn't it?

29:10.624 --> 29:12.690
We weren't close.

29:25.906 --> 29:29.240
Righto, Tick.
Your go, mate.

29:34.948 --> 29:36.648
Go on.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.121
Fuckin' messy pricks!

29:43.123 --> 29:45.256
Just do her up the back, mate.

29:49.830 --> 29:53.631
Why do I always have to
do 'em up the back?

31:05.939 --> 31:10.341
Ah! Ah! Ah!

33:51.237 --> 33:52.670
It's a police matter.

33:52.672 --> 33:55.239
He's about as useful
as a fart in a pantry.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.709
That Abo
killed three people.

33:57.711 --> 33:59.210
She didn't kill anyone!

33:59.212 --> 34:01.913
Get her out of there
before they come back.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.247
Pam, I'm doing the accounts!

34:03.249 --> 34:05.550
She's innocent!

34:05.552 --> 34:07.452
I've got no time for women

34:07.454 --> 34:12.389
who go stupidly hitching
themselves to bad men.

34:13.960 --> 34:18.629
We promised them. Treated and
entitled like everyone else.

34:18.630 --> 34:21.099
- What?
- If they fought.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.967
Promised 'em both times.

34:22.969 --> 34:26.036
They'll get treated
like animals

34:26.039 --> 34:28.505
until they learn to behave.

34:28.507 --> 34:29.841
All of 'em.

34:29.842 --> 34:32.677
That's just the way it is.

34:34.380 --> 34:35.980
Hey!

34:38.717 --> 34:41.485
- You right, Mrs B?
- No, I'm not right!

34:41.487 --> 34:44.222
Here for your
pound of flesh too?

34:44.224 --> 34:46.724
Pound of... beer.

34:46.726 --> 34:48.659
You know, land, hopefully.

34:48.661 --> 34:51.429
They wonder why
people get shot.

34:51.431 --> 34:53.598
What's going on, Mrs B?

34:53.600 --> 34:56.367
It's a godless,
friendless land.

34:56.369 --> 34:58.002
You'll choke on it.

34:58.004 --> 35:00.738
Come here, come here.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.407

38:02.488 --> 38:04.255

anything like that.

- Yeah, boss.

40:02.308 --> 40:05.643
- How'd you do?
- Two dead niggers.

40:05.645 --> 40:08.846
You hear that,
Banganha?

40:08.848 --> 40:11.415
Two of yours already dead.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.952
That does even things up.

40:15.021 --> 40:18.856
Now, I've got a mind to let
the rest of your people go

40:18.858 --> 40:21.258

40:22.361 --> 40:26.797

40:31.070 --> 40:33.237
No offence, ladies.

40:44.350 --> 40:49.987
Now, you've been
a very bad boong.

40:50.590 --> 40:52.857
You killed my baby brother.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.362
Has the cat got your tongue?

41:01.033 --> 41:02.433
Remember what I said before,

41:02.435 --> 41:05.269
that we've evened up
the score?

41:07.173 --> 41:09.240
I lied.

41:13.312 --> 41:15.112
You're my brother.

41:15.114 --> 41:17.948
Do I look like
a black bastard to you?

41:17.950 --> 41:20.384
I see it in your eyes.

41:22.488 --> 41:25.723
No!

41:25.725 --> 41:27.591
Tick...

41:29.128 --> 41:30.661

41:35.902 --> 41:37.301
- No!
- No!

41:37.303 --> 41:39.503
- No!
- Please, please, please.

41:39.505 --> 41:41.572
- Shhh!
- No, no!

41:41.574 --> 41:42.907
No, no! Please!

41:42.909 --> 41:46.343
Bushy, Bushy.
Not that one.

41:46.345 --> 41:48.078
No!

41:48.080 --> 41:50.181
Get on your knees.

41:50.583 --> 41:52.783
Do as I say.

41:54.020 --> 41:57.221

42:03.596 --> 42:06.497
Just take me. Let them go.

42:06.499 --> 42:08.799
We'll be taking you.

42:08.801 --> 42:12.603
Hey, Bushy,
you fancy a bit of him?

42:12.605 --> 42:15.973
Yeah, well,
he's pretty sweet, mate.

42:16.375 --> 42:19.276
Better ask Tick.
He likes it up the back.

42:32.758 --> 42:33.991
Stop!

42:33.993 --> 42:36.327
Let me have a go

Hey.

42:53.279 --> 42:55.412
She your daughter?

42:55.982 --> 42:58.282
You mind if we fuck her?

42:58.851 --> 43:01.051
What's that? You don't mind?

43:01.721 --> 43:05.022
"Yes, boss, you can
fuck her all you like.

43:05.024 --> 43:08.092
Thanks, boss.
Don't mind if we do.

43:08.361 --> 43:12.129
Hey, Tick,
he says it's alright.

43:14.200 --> 43:17.468
- She smells so sweet, mate.
- Mmm.

43:17.903 --> 43:21.405
I gotta have her... now, mate.

43:21.407 --> 43:23.007
- Go on.
- Now!

43:24.343 --> 43:28.445
Oh, God! No! Oh, God!

43:28.447 --> 43:31.548
No, no, no!

43:31.550 --> 43:33.317
No!

43:33.319 --> 43:34.685
Oh, God.

43:34.687 --> 43:36.420
No!

43:36.422 --> 43:39.523
What did you
do that for?

43:39.525 --> 43:41.825
So who we got left?

43:41.827 --> 43:45.029
Get up, Tick. Bugger off.

43:46.399 --> 43:48.265
Dry your eyes.

43:48.267 --> 43:50.634
Too fat.

43:53.406 --> 43:56.307
Too old.

43:58.944 --> 44:01.145
What do you reckon?

44:01.147 --> 44:02.012
Hey?

44:02.014 --> 44:05.349
Yeah, you're right.
Too fucking useless.

44:16.329 --> 44:18.529
Get up.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.434
Dad.

44:23.436 --> 44:25.369
Please.

44:27.073 --> 44:28.972
Bushy, rope.

44:29.675 --> 44:32.609
Move. Move!

44:32.611 --> 44:33.844
Move!

44:37.550 --> 44:40.184
Please don't hurt my dad.

44:40.252 --> 44:44.021
Your daddy had it coming.
That's just the way it is.

44:45.858 --> 44:48.859
Kelly said you loved me.

44:49.261 --> 44:51.895
No time for nice stories, kid.

44:54.166 --> 44:55.599
Kelly wouldn't want this,

44:55.601 --> 44:59.403
wouldn't want you
to hurt me like this.

44:59.605 --> 45:03.407
This is exactly
what Kelly would want.

45:46.519 --> 45:48.719
Why did you call me Jarah?

45:48.721 --> 45:51.889
- You know why.
- Tell me again, Da.

45:53.759 --> 45:55.325
Alright.

45:55.327 --> 45:58.896
A very, very long time ago...

45:59.598 --> 46:02.666
..someone planted a tiny
jarrah seed at the beach,

46:02.668 --> 46:05.169
right at the very tip
of the country.

46:05.171 --> 46:08.972
And that jarrah seed grew tall
and strong.

46:08.974 --> 46:12.409
And you were born
under that tree.

46:12.411 --> 46:15.712
That morning,
as the sun came up,

46:15.714 --> 46:20.083
it was as if though
that tree had caught fire,

46:20.085 --> 46:22.719
and as you took
your first breaths,

46:22.721 --> 46:27.458
that golden light
shone in your face

46:27.460 --> 46:29.359
and you were
the most beautifullest,

46:29.361 --> 46:32.229
powerfullest thing
we'd ever seen.

46:33.399 --> 46:36.066
And we knew right there
and then

46:36.068 --> 46:39.970
that you too would grow
tall and strong

46:39.972 --> 46:42.539
just like that jarrah.

46:44.610 --> 46:46.710
Are you ready for this?

46:46.712 --> 46:48.946
Show me.

46:49.315 --> 46:51.415
You remember everything
I've taught ya?

46:51.417 --> 46:54.251
- Of course I have.
- Right.

46:54.253 --> 46:56.820
Here we go.

46:57.490 --> 47:00.357
Yes, that's one.

47:01.293 --> 47:03.694
Yes, good shootin'.

47:04.263 --> 47:07.331
Yes, beauty.
Now the one at the back.

47:07.833 --> 47:11.468
Whoo-hoo!
That's my beautiful girl!

47:16.175 --> 47:19.343
What's wrong with you?

47:19.345 --> 47:21.411
Get her down!

47:31.223 --> 47:34.658
Get out, you fool.

47:34.894 --> 47:40.197
You eat this when he goes,
you hear me?

47:40.332 --> 47:45.002
The Crossing.
You remember the Crossing.

47:45.004 --> 47:46.870
- Fever.
- Good.

47:46.872 --> 47:48.438
What do you do with them?

47:48.440 --> 47:50.307
You boil them
and drink the water.

47:50.309 --> 47:52.910
- When?
- When the water's cool.

47:54.947 --> 47:56.413
Oh, no.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.015
This no good.

47:58.017 --> 48:00.884
See the lines on the side?
Look.

48:00.886 --> 48:03.754
This one... this one's OK.

48:03.756 --> 48:05.188
This one's OK to eat.

48:05.190 --> 48:08.325
But this one...
this one paralyse.

48:08.327 --> 48:09.826
'Para-lyse'...

48:09.828 --> 48:11.662
What's 'paralyse'?

48:11.664 --> 48:12.696
Hmm.

48:12.698 --> 48:13.830
You know sometimes

48:13.832 --> 48:17.234
when you get so scared
you can't move?

48:18.203 --> 48:19.736
That's 'paralyse'.

48:19.738 --> 48:23.006
No matter how much you
want to, you just can't move.

48:23.008 --> 48:24.775
It's silly they grow together.

48:24.777 --> 48:27.210
It's for those
who are meant to know.

48:27.212 --> 48:29.813
Come on.

48:29.815 --> 48:32.449
Get some Budhaay.

50:06.478 --> 50:07.310
Jim!

50:07.312 --> 50:11.648
Jim Owen Francis Wilson,
you get out here right now!

50:12.818 --> 50:14.384
You've got
three heifers calving

50:14.386 --> 50:16.153
and you have
to check the till.

50:16.155 --> 50:18.789
Shut up, woman.

50:19.758 --> 50:20.857
Give me the keys!

50:20.859 --> 50:24.127
- You are not driving.
- Oh, bloody well am.

50:24.129 --> 50:29.099
No wife of mine is gonna be
bloody driving me around.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.591
Who are you?

50:56.428 --> 50:57.828
A friend.

50:57.830 --> 51:00.764
Not my friend.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.032
Waru's.

51:02.034 --> 51:03.800
Won't get far with that,
Mrs B.

51:03.802 --> 51:07.337
I'm not going. They'll be
on us like sauce on a pie.

51:07.339 --> 51:09.121
Bloody hell.

51:09.123 --> 51:10.906
Take her down south. I'll tell
them you're looking for work.

51:10.909 --> 51:11.875
As if.

51:11.877 --> 51:14.711
- Then visiting relatives.
- Yeah, right.

51:14.713 --> 51:15.746
Chasing a skirt, then.

51:15.748 --> 51:17.948
Turn it up, Mrs B.
Turn it up.

51:17.950 --> 51:19.583
I'm not going south.

51:19.585 --> 51:23.186
You will if you want to live.

52:43.902 --> 52:46.803
Here. It's tea.

52:47.606 --> 52:48.905
Drink it.

52:55.948 --> 53:00.417
Waru's smart.
He'll be far away.

53:00.419 --> 53:03.286
And we got Buckley's
of finding him.

53:03.288 --> 53:06.556
You don't know
what I'm looking for.

to you destroy you.

53:22.608 --> 53:24.274
Destroy me?

53:25.844 --> 53:28.311
They made me.

53:29.014 --> 53:33.383
Saddle up.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

53:33.385 --> 53:36.286
Too fat.

53:39.191 --> 53:41.825

53:45.030 --> 53:47.264
Jarah, wait up.

55:04.109 --> 55:06.977
I've got your daughter.

55:10.615 --> 55:12.515

right now.

01:23:16.733 --> 01:23:19.034
I would've killed me.

01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:22.537
Then you're lucky
we're not you.

01:23:23.807 --> 01:23:25.607
Knew how to love once.

01:23:25.609 --> 01:23:28.143
I can see it in you.

01:23:37.154 --> 01:23:39.587
Eat and you may die.

01:23:39.589 --> 01:23:42.757
Don't and you will.

01:24:58.635 --> 01:24:59.768
She's alive.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.367
Jeez.

01:25:32.369 --> 01:25:35.804
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Binda!

01:25:37.073 --> 01:25:38.072
She needs a transfusion.

01:25:38.074 --> 01:25:41.409
My army doc said my blood's
good for anyone, Mrs B.

01:27:07.230 --> 01:27:09.097
Paddy!

01:27:18.208 --> 01:27:20.341
Where's my boy?

01:27:20.911 --> 01:27:24.279
Oh, Paddy. My cross to bear.

01:27:24.748 --> 01:27:27.815
Any idea what
you're doing here, son?

01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:30.618
Men from Sydney
will be here tomorrow.

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.921
What good are they?

01:27:32.923 --> 01:27:34.622
No, son, rain's coming.

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.991
We leave today or we lose 'em.

01:27:36.993 --> 01:27:38.493
Witnesses?

01:27:38.495 --> 01:27:39.827
Just one.

01:27:49.105 --> 01:27:51.739
Pamela Bradfield.

01:27:51.741 --> 01:27:53.942
Mr Mackay.

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:58.313
Something not quite right
about you, Mrs Bradfield.

01:27:58.882 --> 01:28:01.716
Oh, you make
a mean stew but...

01:28:02.185 --> 01:28:04.852
..never did see you
in my church.

01:28:06.256 --> 01:28:09.457
Doing devil's work,
'twas oft said.

01:28:09.459 --> 01:28:12.226
By those who ought to know.

01:28:12.228 --> 01:28:15.530
I've no wish to engage
in falsehoods.

01:28:15.532 --> 01:28:18.466
And you know
I cut my bread straight.

01:28:28.812 --> 01:28:32.714
Oh, I do miss the
theatricality of the pulpit.

Not anymore.

01:29:47.557 --> 01:29:49.424
Give me the gun.

01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:54.028
Surry Hills, 597.

01:29:55.799 --> 01:29:59.267
Detective Sergeant MacGregor
for the Superintendent.

01:30:01.738 --> 01:30:03.371
There's no-one here, sir.

01:30:03.373 --> 01:30:06.574
No. No, the place is deserted.

01:30:07.677 --> 01:30:10.178
Waiting on
the tracker now, sir.

01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:27.962
Go get the girl.

01:31:14.477 --> 01:31:17.245
- He's slowing us down.
- I don't care.

01:31:17.247 --> 01:31:19.113
Please stop.

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:23.451
- Until we're far enough away.
- He has to pay.

01:31:24.521 --> 01:31:26.154
He will pay.

01:31:26.156 --> 01:31:28.656
But when it's safe.

01:31:39.169 --> 01:31:41.102
It's OK.

01:33:40.623 --> 01:33:41.956
Ahhh!

01:35:42.078 --> 01:35:44.178
It'll help.

01:35:46.883 --> 01:35:49.383
I don't understand.

01:35:49.385 --> 01:35:51.552
You will.

01:35:51.554 --> 01:35:53.521
Drink.

01:35:58.127 --> 01:36:00.327
You should kill me.

01:36:07.503 --> 01:36:09.370
You'll go faster.

01:36:09.372 --> 01:36:12.072
Be safer for the women.

01:36:14.977 --> 01:36:17.778
Wanted nothing more
than to kill ya.

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:21.715
But I'm not that man anymore.

01:36:22.618 --> 01:36:25.920
So you'll learn and change
and when you prove yourself,

01:36:25.922 --> 01:36:28.222
you'll be forgiven.

01:37:03.426 --> 01:37:05.159
Hey.

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:08.162
It's OK.

01:39:10.753 --> 01:39:12.486
Beans!

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.788
How are you so happy?

01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:17.257
I don't know.

01:39:18.227 --> 01:39:19.994
I'm free.

01:39:21.230 --> 01:39:23.764
- We'll go get some water.
- I'll come too.

01:39:23.766 --> 01:39:26.200
Jarah, it's OK.

01:39:30.039 --> 01:39:31.972
Let 'em go.

01:39:38.214 --> 01:39:39.313
Take this.

01:39:39.315 --> 01:39:42.116
- I won't be needing it.
- Take it.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.053
And use it.

01:40:21.524 --> 01:40:23.057
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:40:23.059 --> 01:40:25.426
- You're right.
- Yeah.

01:40:29.398 --> 01:40:32.299
Sometimes I forget
how bad you've been.

01:40:33.602 --> 01:40:35.969
I'm a dangerous man, Maggie,

01:40:36.972 --> 01:40:39.540
I've done things
you wouldn't speak of.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:44.144
Do you regret it?
Doing all those things?

01:40:46.482 --> 01:40:48.782
You have to live with it.

01:40:50.453 --> 01:40:52.653
Can you live with it?

01:40:54.356 --> 01:40:56.190
We have to.

01:41:03.466 --> 01:41:05.466
Do you remember?

01:41:06.335 --> 01:41:07.768
Remember what?

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:10.604
How it felt to love?

01:41:22.318 --> 01:41:25.185
Oh, shit. Oh, God. Oh.

01:41:27.156 --> 01:41:29.623
No. Go further down.

01:41:45.674 --> 01:41:46.840
Oh, shit.

01:41:56.018 --> 01:41:57.918
Oh, shi...

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.920
- Jarah!
- I didn't.

01:41:59.922 --> 01:42:02.189
The idiot ate crabapples.

01:42:12.334 --> 01:42:14.101
Gun.

01:42:16.539 --> 01:42:19.540
Sorry. I'll go get it.

01:42:22.378 --> 01:42:23.977
Oh, shit.

01:42:52.575 --> 01:42:54.241
Oh, shit.

01:42:54.243 --> 01:42:55.976
Oh...

01:43:10.626 --> 01:43:12.726

so loved the world..."

01:43:12.728 --> 01:43:13.293
Fuck.

He's with me.

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.766
When he reloads.

01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:54.401
We'll be with her.

01:43:54.403 --> 01:43:56.136
She wasn't there.

01:43:56.138 --> 01:43:57.971
What do you mean?

01:43:57.973 --> 01:44:00.240
Stay alive.

01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:05.078
I love you.

01:44:06.248 --> 01:44:08.181
I love you.

Oh, not you, Paddy.

Throw your guns down
or I'll blow her brains out.

01:46:44.373 --> 01:46:46.406
Come on, now!

01:46:52.481 --> 01:46:55.449
Don't worry, my baby.
Dinosaurs become extinct.

01:46:55.451 --> 01:47:00.387
Oh, yes, and the path of the
righteous is awash with blood,

01:47:00.389 --> 01:47:02.155
none of it mine.

01:47:02.157 --> 01:47:05.092
Holy shit, son.

01:47:07.863 --> 01:47:10.564

brain fever, boy.

01:47:11.433 --> 01:47:12.699

It's the right thing to do.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.940
Witchery.

01:47:19.942 --> 01:47:22.476
No, Da!

01:47:26.348 --> 01:47:28.048
I'll do it.

01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:29.316
Don't think I won't.

01:47:29.318 --> 01:47:32.953

Most likely dead, sir.

my grandmother's country?

01:50:13.749 --> 01:50:15.415
Too far to swim.
