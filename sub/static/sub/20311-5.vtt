WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.630
OK, so you
will copy this down.

00:07.758 --> 00:08.926
No talking please.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.427
It's going to be on the test,

00:10.427 --> 00:11.762
so you might want
to pay attention.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.348
Why is that?

00:14.348 --> 00:18.894
Hang on a minute.
OK, it's facing me.

00:18.894 --> 00:24.817
-Sir, I, uh, I think you just--
-Ben, please. Nope, nope.

00:28.863 --> 00:33.158
Like that...
should go like that...

00:36.662 --> 00:39.498
Tell Trudy I need
25 copies of this,

00:39.498 --> 00:42.751
and tell her my
machine is broken.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.213
Sir, the machine isn't
broken, you just don't
know how to use it.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.507
You ever try to cut
your hair in the mirror?

00:48.507 --> 00:52.011
It's the same,
that's what that reminded me of,
trying to...

00:52.011 --> 00:54.805
Don't need that on.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.561
-Sir, please--
-OK, hear that?

01:00.561 --> 01:07.484
[singing indistinctly]

01:07.484 --> 01:11.530
What song is that? Made it up,
you wouldn't know it.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.614
It's just right here.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.248
Broken.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.430
Welcome to Bully Awareness Week.

01:36.430 --> 01:41.435
Let the awareness
begin... now.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.854
Need a hand there, Robert?

01:43.854 --> 01:47.524
-I am not!
-I am not?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.985
That's what you should do when
you're confronted by a bully.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.821
-That doesn't even make sense.
-Not what?

01:52.821 --> 01:55.490
-Sir, you yelled at me.
-I didn't yell at you, Robert.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.534
With all due respect,
you took a tone.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.578
This week is very important
to me.

01:59.578 --> 02:03.624
I was bullied
in elementary school,

02:03.624 --> 02:06.585
and again in high school,
a little bit at university,

02:06.585 --> 02:09.671
and frankly the odd time
here at work I'm bullied.

02:09.671 --> 02:14.134
This one time in high school
I was chased by 20 students from
the feeder school next door.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.805
Grade threes!

02:17.805 --> 02:20.057
I didn't know what they
were capable of,
I think I blacked out.

02:20.057 --> 02:25.062
I just ran and ran and ran. But
now thanks to the Wooly Bullies

02:25.062 --> 02:29.691
I can confront and deal
with any bullying situation
that might arise.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.070
Wait, you said you were
in high school

02:33.070 --> 02:36.364
when you were chased by...
by grade threes?

02:36.364 --> 02:40.201
Yeah, but by 20 of them, Gerry.
20 of anything can kill you.

02:40.201 --> 02:44.581
No, mice. 20 mice
would not kill you.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.459
-Simon?
-If they're organized.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.586
-What do you mean
"if they're organized"?
-OK, all right.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.965
The video, please?

02:52.965 --> 02:57.260
Isolation, shame, I am not.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.556
I need shelter
from your word daggers.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.978
I am! I am me!

03:07.855 --> 03:10.189
They're even more impressive
live, you won't believe it.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.693
-Wow.
-OK, sorry, sir.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.153
We can't be doing this for real,

03:14.153 --> 03:16.822
showing this to the kids
for Bully Awareness Week?

03:16.822 --> 03:19.616
Yes, Mr. Duncan, this is
what we're gonna show the kids.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.243
Unless of course you have a
better idea, maybe you can
come up with your own

03:22.243 --> 03:25.413
-anti-bullying project.
-OK, I will,
I will do something.

03:25.413 --> 03:29.168
I look forward, as I'm sure
we all do to seeing your
anti-bullying project

03:29.168 --> 03:31.837
in a mere two days from now,
but I'm sure
for a big tough guy like you

03:31.837 --> 03:33.839
that'll be no problem
to pull together.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.802
Yeah, I will...
I will have something.

03:38.802 --> 03:42.472
-OK, all right, great.
Look, everybody...
-Gentlemen...

03:42.472 --> 03:46.685
Simon, sit down please.
All right, everybody,

03:46.685 --> 03:50.898
now let's get out there,
let's try and reach these kids
before it's too late.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.941
Teach hard, everybody.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.820
Did you know it's
Bully Awareness Week?

03:56.820 --> 03:58.739
And I have been asked to do
a presentation

03:58.739 --> 04:01.867
at the bully assembly,
which is a bit awkward

04:01.867 --> 04:05.662
because I was a bully
in school, OK?

04:05.662 --> 04:10.458
Most star athletes were, so it's
not something I'm proud of.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.960
What kind of things did you do?

04:11.960 --> 04:15.672
I would take candy from this kid
Josh's lunch everyday,

04:15.672 --> 04:19.885
I would take notes
from Beverly's locker,

04:19.885 --> 04:21.595
I would just take them.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.432
Sir, it sounds more like you
were a thief than a bully.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.309
Hmm... Oh,
I bullied a kid, Patrick.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.645
I didn't steal anything
from him. Actually do you...

04:30.645 --> 04:33.273
do you have an uncle,
an Uncle Patrick?

04:33.273 --> 04:36.777
-Um, not that I know of.
-Any relatives?

04:36.777 --> 04:40.697
-No
-Hmm, bet you do. OK.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.366
Sir, why don't we do one of
those "It gets better" videos?

04:43.366 --> 04:44.993
That went viral
and the whole world saw it.

04:44.993 --> 04:49.039
That's one of those
online gay videos that...

04:49.039 --> 04:51.792
-I've seen that.
-That would be good, sir.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.878
-Gay people get bullied a lot!
-Yes, that's what
we're gonna do.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.131
Thank you, Sheila!

04:58.506 --> 05:02.970
All right, we've got it,
take out your books.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.514
-It does get better. Sh...
-I'm... I'm not gay, sir.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.434
When you're ready, not now.
I know...

05:09.434 --> 05:13.105
-No, I'm really not.
-When you're ready, I get it.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.357
I hear ya.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.069
I hear ya!

05:19.069 --> 05:21.113
So I'll see you tonight then?

05:21.113 --> 05:23.824
OK, bye-bye.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.743
Aw... [sighs]

05:26.743 --> 05:29.579
So sorry you had to get
all caught up in that.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.749
-What are you talking about?
-The phone conversation I
was just having.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.876
What a great girl
I met this week.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.461
Yeah I wasn't
really paying attention.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.672
We were making
dinner plans just now.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.508
-Hmm
-Speaking of which,

05:41.508 --> 05:44.094
we should have dinner with you
and Craig some night.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.553
You want to have dinner with us?

05:45.553 --> 05:48.765
Yeah, girlfriend's
quite the cook, I think.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.144
-Girlfriend?
-Mmm-hmm, Joanna.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.979
The ole ball and chain.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.606
You're talking about
the girl you just met?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.900
-Oh yeah, but things
are escalating quickly.
-Gotcha.

05:58.900 --> 06:04.572
This thing has a train
off the rails. Look how fast
she responds to my texts. Watch.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.668
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, how's it goin'?

06:16.668 --> 06:20.130
Good. Listen, I'm doing
something for
the bully assembly.

06:20.130 --> 06:26.511
-Mmm-hmm
-Do bullies always beat
up kids that they bully?

06:26.511 --> 06:30.307
Or is it just verbal?
From your experience,
is it physical too?

06:30.307 --> 06:33.727
Oh, um, I think it can be both.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.271
-You don't know, though?
-I'm not 100%.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.983
OK, think back
and see if you can remember
and then let me know.

06:39.983 --> 06:44.196
-It would be helpful,
it's for the kids.
-Uh, yes, I will try.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.031
OK.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.506
History was full of bullies.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.676
Stalin, '74 Flyers.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.803
Group of bullies.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.598
Napoleon, who was very short.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.893
Short people aren't
usually bullies, so irony.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.520
For the video I'm doing
for the school,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.482
I'd like to know if any of you
have ever been bullied?

07:21.482 --> 07:24.986
OK, hold on one sec, Lucy.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.322
All right, tell us your
bullying story, go ahead.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.449
When I was little,
people made fun of me

07:29.449 --> 07:31.410
because they said my dog
wasn't a real dog.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.661
OK, that's just the story,
though. That's not a--

07:33.661 --> 07:36.998
That's... they're not bullying
you, what kind of dog was it?

07:36.998 --> 07:39.542
-A poodle.
-A poodle.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.462
-[laughter]
-That's not a...

07:42.462 --> 07:45.090
Hold on, let me just
get some of that laughter.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.636
Well, that's not
a real dog Lucy, OK?
That's why they made fun of you.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.930
Did they make fun
of you for anything else?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.681
No, sir, just the poodle stuff.

07:53.681 --> 07:57.685
No nickname?
Nothing... nothing silly?
No? OK.

07:57.685 --> 08:03.566
Nothing... there's nothing?
All right, one story.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.319
Tell you what, I'm going to run
to the office for a second.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.030
I don't want to hear any
talking. If anyone
talks when I'm gone,

08:09.030 --> 08:12.826
you have to kiss Edward on
the lips when I come back.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.661
[all] Ew!

08:16.955 --> 08:18.957
-Where is it?
-Uh, I don't have it.

08:18.957 --> 08:24.296
Hey, what are you doing?

08:24.296 --> 08:26.173
Do that again, that was...
do that again.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.091
-Excuse me?
-I don't want him
to do it again.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.219
Excuse me, I want you
to video tape this.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.430
-But I have to go to class.
-I'll give you a note.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.807
Do it again. Action!

08:35.807 --> 08:39.602
-Where is it?
-Cut. That was terrible.

08:39.602 --> 08:44.691
OK, go, go, go, go, go, wait.
Just let him get
out of here, go.

08:44.691 --> 08:48.028
This might do something. OK, go.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.737
No, keep it,
you're my camera boy.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.699
You're going to follow me,
you're going to film everything.

08:52.699 --> 08:56.870
OK? Did you see the fear?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.122
It was powerful.
Let's go! Come on.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.335
Bobbi? Have to cancel
our dinner, I'm afraid.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.420
Me and the wife are in a bit
of a doozy right now.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.089
So, we'll reschedule, OK? Women!

09:08.089 --> 09:10.842
-Trudy.
-Gerry.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.178
I have a proposition for ya.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.930
You give me the medical records
for all the grade five students

09:15.930 --> 09:19.684
and I will bring some friends
to your band's next gig.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.312
All right, here you go.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.898
We perform on the 14th
and I will see you there.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.693
-OK, that was easy.
-Every teacher gets one
at the beginning of the year.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.489
-So it's not secret information?
-No, it's crucial information.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.699
-And everyone has it?
-That's correct.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.784
And I didn't have to
promise the band thing?

09:36.784 --> 09:39.704
-That's correct.
-But I still gotta go?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.040
That's correct.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.420
Bye.

09:48.547 --> 09:50.590
All right, here's some stuff
to help us with the video.

09:50.590 --> 09:54.261
Miranda, allergic to gluten?
Ah, that's nothing, boring.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.431
Oh! Here's a good one.
Jordan, stand up.

09:57.431 --> 10:01.142
Jordan is allergic to sheep.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.437
[laughter]

10:03.437 --> 10:06.440
-How do you fall asleep
at night?
-Yeah, what are you? A freak?

10:06.440 --> 10:09.609
OK, no. He is not
a freak, Stephan.

10:09.609 --> 10:13.238
You went too far.
You're a freak.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.575
And you're adopted. There! OK?

10:16.575 --> 10:20.287
How would that make you
feel if I were to say
something like that.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.457
-I was adopted, sir.
-What?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.875
You were not adopted.

10:28.086 --> 10:31.798
"Stephan Sinclair recently
found out he was adopted

10:31.798 --> 10:34.926
and struggles with this..."

10:34.926 --> 10:37.387
OK.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.600
All right, buddy.
Hey, that's OK.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.145
-Tell him he's a freak.
-You're a freak.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.314
-[laughs] Say it again.
-Sit down, freak.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.232
-Sit down, freak, yeah!
-Loser.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.568
OK, too far again, see?
See what happened there?

10:51.568 --> 10:55.530
Too far again.
Did you get all that?
Did you get the sadness?

10:55.530 --> 10:56.739
And him standing?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.451
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.202
Patrick!

11:01.202 --> 11:05.873
Hey, uh, this is, uh,
Gerry Duncan. Yes, that Gerry.

11:05.873 --> 11:09.503
No, Patrick, don't hang up,
please. Listen, Patrick,

11:09.503 --> 11:13.465
I'd like you to meet me at
Barrel's this Friday at 7:00.

11:13.465 --> 11:19.471
Well, I'll explain everything
then, but I... really important
that you meet me.

11:19.471 --> 11:24.476
OK, thank you so much.
All right, see you then.

11:24.476 --> 11:28.605
OK, kids, listen up.
Mr. Duncan has something that
he wants to share with you.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.316
-Just make it quick, OK?
-All right,
everybody stand up.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.735
Everybody, hello.
I need, uh, two captains.

11:34.735 --> 11:38.615
OK, yup,
and the young man right there.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.660
You are our captains,
we are going to pick teams

11:41.660 --> 11:45.830
just as you would if we
were gonna play basketball.
You can go first.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.707
-Uh, Joey.
-Yeah, that's who I'd
pick first, watch this.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.378
-Can I pick Ms. Galka?
-You can pick either one,
we're both--

11:51.378 --> 11:55.923
OK, I get it, girl picks girl.
OK! I'm in, available.

11:55.923 --> 12:01.262
Apparently...
Yeah, him, me?

12:01.262 --> 12:04.307
OK, let's...
who's he pointing at?

12:04.307 --> 12:06.601
I'm in. Should be come...

12:06.601 --> 12:09.812
Gotta be clear, guys,
who you're... OK...

12:09.812 --> 12:11.981
Right? Am I right?
No brainer, Gordon.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.732
-We'll take Gordon.
-Yeah.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.903
Well, I guess we'll
take Mr. Duncan then.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.031
Obviously you're gonna...

12:20.031 --> 12:23.410
You seriously think Gordon
is a better basketball player
than me?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.328
-Never seen you play.
-You don't need to see...

12:25.328 --> 12:27.288
Yeah, we gotta get back
to class, but I think what

12:27.288 --> 12:29.916
Mr. Duncan is trying to teach us
is a little something
about bullying

12:29.916 --> 12:34.795
and the loneliness that must be
felt from being a last pick,
so let's give this guy a hand.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.632
OK, let's play then.
I got my team,

12:37.632 --> 12:39.718
I will cover Gordon
and I will cover Ms. Galka.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.053
I will cover-- I don't even need
my team, that doesn't...

12:42.053 --> 12:45.139
You know what?
We don't have time.
This isn't... no time.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.100
You know what?
Light jog around the school,
you guys.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.395
-Let's go, pick it up.
-What were you thinking?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.564
-Come on, Gordon,
you're leading the pack there.
-Don't film this.

12:52.564 --> 12:54.482
-But you said to roll.
-But there's sun now.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.152
There was no sun earlier,
it blocks the light.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.739
Can't have light. Come on.

13:03.533 --> 13:08.204
Thanks for coming.
And as I said, we are shooting
a movie here at the school

13:08.204 --> 13:10.789
and all of you are gonna
be in the movie.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.251
That's right,
you're gonna be stars.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.630
What the movie about, sir?

13:16.630 --> 13:19.966
You and you. Everybody.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.343
You're all in the movie.
It's about bullying.

13:22.343 --> 13:28.891
It's a movie about bullies
and how they pick on people
that have things different.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.770
Then we're gonna show it
to the school.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.731
Then, the best part...

13:34.731 --> 13:37.024
We're gonna put it on YouTube
and the whole world will see it.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.111
-[bell rings]
-You'll be the
faces of bullying.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.071
Hello? Did you hear what I said?

13:42.071 --> 13:44.949
OK, if you go,
you're not in the movie.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.242
Ginger?

13:48.244 --> 13:50.371
Now we have no movie.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.423
Hey, Gerry. I'm so excited
to see your movie.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.592
Yeah, no movie, change of plans,
switchin' it up.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.927
-Oh, what are you going to do?
-Not sure yet.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.515
But you're still
gonna do something,

14:08.515 --> 14:11.768
like, unprepared in front
of the entire school?

14:11.768 --> 14:15.689
Well, I still have
time to prepare, but you
and I would stop talking,

14:15.689 --> 14:17.982
'cause it's...
I'm just going through stuff.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.319
-Right.
-So gotta move, gotta move.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.157
Go away! Name caller.

14:26.157 --> 14:31.204
I am not, fear is a jaguar,
sleek and hungry.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.873
[all growl]

14:33.873 --> 14:35.375
You gotta be kidding me.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.711
Sturdy and beautiful.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.379
How am I supposed
to follow this?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.882
-I am.
-I am me.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.176
[applause]

14:47.428 --> 14:52.642
Amazing. Come here.
Just life-changing.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.312
-Get off.
-The Wooly Bullies.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.232
Let's each take a moment
to marinate in the...

14:59.232 --> 15:03.695
in the new feelings
we're experiencing after
witnessing that spectacle.

15:03.695 --> 15:06.239
-Turn his mic off.
-And while you're doing that,

15:06.239 --> 15:08.658
here's Mr. Duncan with his
anti-bullying video
presentation.

15:08.658 --> 15:13.580
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

15:13.580 --> 15:18.042
I did have a video planned,
but things didn't work out.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.503
But I have a message.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.881
How many of you know
what that is?

15:22.881 --> 15:26.551
That is the gang symbol of
the gang I was in as a child.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.178
Called "The Swans."
There was four of us,

15:29.178 --> 15:32.766
we would create havoc,
pick on people,

15:32.766 --> 15:36.018
people would come at us,
we would defend,
and we would hurt them.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.689
I know that's wrong,
but I also know that we all
have imperfections.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.859
I have eczema right there.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.820
Take a good look,
go ahead. Ha-ha.

15:45.820 --> 15:49.115
Ha-ha.
Doesn't hurt my feelings.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.326
Sure, I disguise it,
but I know it's there.

15:52.326 --> 15:55.371
You have a big zit I can see,
massive.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.791
Right there, that guy,
on his face. Up higher, higher.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.626
Nope, higher up,
a little higher,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.920
this way and then over,
across.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.673
Right there, feel it?
OK? It's huge.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.008
So what? People will
make fun of that.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.053
Who has a big nose?
You do, that guy right there.

16:11.053 --> 16:15.057
Look at it. So what
he has a massive nose?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.728
So what he has a giant pimple
protruding from his face?

16:18.728 --> 16:22.565
We don't make fun of that.
Doesn't matter.

16:22.565 --> 16:27.027
What matters is the people
that know you and care about you

16:27.027 --> 16:31.324
and love you are the ones that
matter. That's all that matters.

16:31.324 --> 16:35.703
Don't let anybody bully you, OK?
Doesn't matter what they say.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.789
You can cut your hair,

16:37.789 --> 16:40.207
that pimple will go away,

16:40.207 --> 16:44.170
and your-- your nose...

16:44.170 --> 16:48.591
I'll leave you
with an inspirational quote
from a very famous movie.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.718
When people pick on me,
I think of it.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.053
It's from the movie Rudy:

16:53.053 --> 16:58.476
"Ru-dy, Ru-dy, Ru-dy."

17:02.563 --> 17:03.940
Remember that.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.528
No more bullying.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.989
Thank you, stay seated.
Thank you, stay seated.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.992
[mouthing words]

17:14.909 --> 17:16.202
Thank you.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.998
I assume you finished,
Mr. Duncan? So...

17:19.998 --> 17:22.249
thanks for whatever it is
that was.

17:22.249 --> 17:25.628
-I nailed that.
-Um...

17:25.628 --> 17:28.381
Since Mr. Duncan was
unable to complete
his video presentation,

17:28.381 --> 17:31.676
we're suddenly faced
with a pretty significant
window of available time.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.595
Which is why it gives me
enormous full body pleasure

17:34.595 --> 17:39.767
to welcome to the stage,
once again, the Wooly Bullies!

17:41.519 --> 17:43.688
[laughter]

17:45.773 --> 17:48.526
Thanks, everyone, for all
of your efforts this week.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.862
I'm also delighted to announce
that the Wooly Bullies

17:50.862 --> 17:53.698
have already agreed
to come back next year.

17:53.698 --> 17:55.575
Awesome!

17:56.534 --> 17:59.787
Oh, it's the missus.
Joanna.

17:59.787 --> 18:05.668
-Hey, bumble bee, everything OK?
-Uh, Robert, can I speak
to you in private?

18:05.668 --> 18:10.006
Of course. What is it?
Is everything OK?

18:10.006 --> 18:14.218
Listen, um, I don't think
this going to work out

18:14.218 --> 18:17.680
and I just wanted
to tell you in person.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.640
I'm just not ready
for something serious

18:19.640 --> 18:23.686
and you seem
to be moving pretty quickly.

18:25.563 --> 18:29.233
Joanna, I'm not
going to change for you.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.987
I know you want this,
but you can't have it, OK?

18:34.196 --> 18:38.200
"I am lovable,
I am a rugged flower."

18:38.200 --> 18:43.581
-He's doing it.
-"Sturdy and beautiful.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.417
I am me."

18:47.668 --> 18:51.631
OK, take care.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.305
Did you see her face?
She's a mess, the poor thing.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.767
You know, she left so quickly,
it was kind of hard to see...

19:02.767 --> 19:09.023
-...if she felt anything.
-It feels so weird
to be single again.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.446
Hey, man, shouldn't you
have on a red rose
so he can recognize you?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.657
You're funny.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.661
-Gerry Duncan.
-Hey, Patrick.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.957
Oh, you brought everybody.
Well, thanks.
Why don't we have a seat?

19:25.957 --> 19:30.252
Um, I think I'll stand.
So, uh, what is it you
wanted to see me about?

19:30.252 --> 19:35.091
-Oh, God, are you sick?
-Am I sick?
No, why would I be sick?

19:35.091 --> 19:38.427
Oh, I just assumed that
you'd heard I was an oncologist,

19:38.427 --> 19:41.973
-and, uh, wanted to see me.
-Oh, no, I did not hear that,

19:41.973 --> 19:47.603
and my eyes are good, so...
except at night, when I drive.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.606
Please sit down
and I'll tell you everything.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.651
I'll just be
a couple minutes honey, OK?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.697
Dad, is this the jerk
you were telling us about?

19:57.697 --> 20:01.075
[laughs] Ah, Clayton,
you little scamp.

20:01.075 --> 20:06.789
Well, actually, uh,
I wanted to apologize to you.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.249
For all the things I did
and said

20:09.249 --> 20:12.003
when we were in grade school,
and it wasn't right.

20:12.003 --> 20:15.089
So, in a lot of ways,
I am a jerk.

20:15.089 --> 20:19.760
You're a waiter? What a loser!
My dad's an oncologist!

20:19.760 --> 20:23.056
Now, Clayton, come on. You
go out with your mom there, OK?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.932
I already said
I'm here to apologize.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.392
I get you're sticking up
for your father.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.935
That's nice,
and I'm not a waiter.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.397
I'm a teacher
at Xavier Academy.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.315
We went through
the doctor thing already, so...

20:33.315 --> 20:35.776
It's going really well.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.277
Anyway, Patrick,
I just wanted to...

20:37.277 --> 20:40.698
Um, small correction,
I kind of like to go
by Dr. Kayka.

20:40.698 --> 20:43.492
-Dr. Kayka.
-I prefer that.

20:43.492 --> 20:48.039
Patty Kayka, that was...
that was what we called you.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.833
Patty Kayka. Oh, God.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.461
That was wrong,
I feel bad about that too.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.590
You should feel bad,
you're a loser!

20:58.716 --> 21:01.010
He hears everything.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.679
How can he not with the massive
ears sticking out of his head?

21:03.679 --> 21:05.806
-And we're gonna go.
-Yeah, pin the ears back.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.517
It was a joke,
it was a joke, Patty Kayka!

21:08.517 --> 21:10.269
-Bye, loser!
-You're the loser.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.605
Wait till girls see
those two wings sticking

21:12.605 --> 21:13.647
out of the side of your head!

21:13.647 --> 21:15.816
Enjoy drinking
loveless and alone.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.285
-That was nice, really nice.
-He started it.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.829
I saw the kids ears when he
walked in, I never said a word.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.374
-Yeah, there ya go, champ.
-What are you doin'
with that, and a straw?

21:32.374 --> 21:35.002
-When do I use a straw?
-Mango Madness, it's new.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.755
A lot of the older female
regulars here really like it.

21:37.755 --> 21:41.008
-Yeah, you're hilarious.
-I'm pretty funny.

21:41.008 --> 21:46.180
Mm. It is good,
I can see why they like it.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.933
That's awesome,
I hope you got more back there.
