06:00.520 --> 06:02.875
What's the odd smell
in this house, inspector?

06:03.080 --> 06:04.798
The smell of war,
Major Grau.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.348
Good morning, inspector.
Major.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.755
I'm sorry to call you
at such an ungodly hour.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.117
Not very nice, I'm afraid.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.959

butcher, I should say.

The dead woman's Polish,
isn't she?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.110
This is not a case
for the German authorities.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.232
Her name was Kupiecka.
Maria Kupiecka.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.873
Kupiecka?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.833
Oh, yes, she was a prostitute

was also a sexual degenerate.

Patriotism has been known

goes beyond normal patriotic zeal.

That's just my guess, sir.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.876
It would be impossible
to count.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.594

of the murderer's attack

A voice on the telephone.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.872

at about 11: 10.

No.

One of you knows something about
the way in which this woman died.

If that person does not tell us
everything he knows,

07:54.480 --> 07:57.631
we shall assume
that her death was political.

That she was killed by a member
of the Polish underground

08:00.880 --> 08:03.553
and that you are all
accomplices.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.832
In which case,
it will be my sad duty

08:08.040 --> 08:11.715

over to the Gestapo.

telephoned the police

08:16.360 --> 08:18.032
has one minute in which
to make himself known.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.996
I heard the scream.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.191
This one terrible scream.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.359
And then, well, I...
I hid in the lavatory.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.632
Then later,
perhaps 10 minutes later,

08:30.840 --> 08:33.308
I telephoned the police.
That's all.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.109
You did not give
the police your name.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.357
That means that there was something
you didn't want them to know.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.960
What could that something be?
Well, there's a...

08:43.159 --> 08:45.469
There's this crack in the door
to the lavatory.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.877
And naturally, you put your eye
to the crack and you saw...?

08:49.080 --> 08:52.152
I saw a man
coming down the stairs.

08:52.360 --> 08:57.195
Describe him, please.
Well, it... It was dark.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.949
Describe him, please.
I couldn't see all of him.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.720
Just the lower part,
the trousers.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.471
Why are you so frightened
by what you saw?

09:09.680 --> 09:12.035
Because it was a uniform, sir.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.356
Like yours.
Like mine?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.790
A German officer?
The man's a liar.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.276
German officers can commit
murders like anyone else.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.550
Is that all you noticed?

09:22.760 --> 09:25.194
That the trousers were like mine?

09:26.120 --> 09:29.476
Exactly like mine?
No.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.353
Not exactly, sir. No.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.712
There was a...

09:34.920 --> 09:37.639
There was a red stripe
running down the leg.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.434
He's lying.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.996
Are you aware that only German
generals wear the red stripe?

09:44.680 --> 09:48.559
Yes, sir. That's why I was afraid.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.159
I see.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.796
It's impossible.
Nothing is impossible.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.835

Well, well.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.952
I don't think we need to take
this testimony too seriously.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.470
After all, it was dark on the stairs.
Sir, I swear...

10:03.680 --> 10:06.240
I swear, I'm telling the truth.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.671
And I believe you, until
there's evidence to the contrary.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.236
Why would he tell a dangerous lie?
I want a complete investigation.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.991

the murderer really is a general?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.715
What happens? Well, justice
is blind, my dear inspector.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.514

the red stripe or the gold braid,

10:24.880 --> 10:28.429

Thank you, Fräulein Neumaier.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.079
It seems we have failed
to keep proper order in the city.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.679
You have read it?
Oh, yes.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.757
And because
of our notorious incompetence...

12:40.960 --> 12:42.678
Incompetence?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.235
They don't realize that
this is a garrison post,

12:45.440 --> 12:47.795

dregs of the army, the misfits.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.072
Well, that was General Tanz's word.
"Incompetence. "

12:51.280 --> 12:53.840
Not to mention subordinates
who shirk responsibility.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.079
And because of our failure, the Führer has ordered
General Tanz to solve the problem of Warsaw.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.589

Meticulously.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.153

First, we'll mark out a wide perimeter, then
we'll start combing the outlying streets.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.154
Of course, they'll try to make off
in the opposite direction,

Filthy pig. Last week
he offered me an unwashed glass.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.874
Now he enters my sight looking as though he
just exhumed his grandmother with his bare hands.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.435
Absolute cleanliness, that's what
I demand from the people around me.

Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.996
As for our immediate requirements,
see they're fully met.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.070
Once they are,
I shall seal off the district

15:55.280 --> 15:57.271

General Tanz,
forgive me,

16:03.080 --> 16:06.550
but just as a matter
of curiosity,

16:06.760 --> 16:09.718
what do you feel is the exact
purpose of this exercise?

16:09.920 --> 16:12.150
You've read the memorandum.
Oh, yes. Yes, I have...

16:12.360 --> 16:13.918
And what does
the memorandum say?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.918
That phase one is intended
to intimidate the population

16:17.120 --> 16:19.509
to search houses,
to find and arrest resistance.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.551
Then that is the exact purpose
of the exercise.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.115
An excellent plan, by the way. Much
like my own when I first came here,

16:24.320 --> 16:27.392
only I was never given the
ultimate authority to implement it.

16:27.600 --> 16:32.754
But am I to understand that if there
is resistance during phase one,

16:32.960 --> 16:36.748
you would then go to phase two
and even to phase three,

16:36.960 --> 16:38.871
which would mean
the destruction of the entire city?

16:39.080 --> 16:41.640
You are to understand
exactly that.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.072
Well, uh, isn't that
somewhat excessive?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.876
Excessive.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.792
You will be aware that we are
30 miles from Moscow.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.355
We are moving ahead

Yet here in Warsaw,
three divisions are rotting,

because of a few thousand criminal
Poles and Jews hiding in slums.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.115
It is excessive to permit
this state of affairs.

Eleanore, come in. Come in, my dear.
I hope I'm not disturbing.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.551
My wife arrived early
this morning from Berlin.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.159
How was Berlin?

17:20.359 --> 17:21.588
Eager to hear the good news

17:21.800 --> 17:24.314
that always follows in the wake
of a good soldier.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.397
When I heard you were with my
husband, I came straight here.

17:27.599 --> 17:31.115
I wanted to tell you myself what an
inspiration you've been to us all at home.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.631
I am flattered, ma'am.
Oh, no, I'm not flattering you.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.751
I'm honoring you
as you deserve.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.757
If you're not too busy,
I shall need your help

17:38.960 --> 17:41.474
with the arrangements
for the soiree tonight.

17:41.680 --> 17:46.276
In your honor, General Tanz.
I'll look forward to it, ma'am.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.756
Oh, incidentally, our daughter,
Ulrike, is here in Warsaw.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.872
She'll be at the soiree too.
Yes?

17:53.080 --> 17:55.196
Well, you remember her,
don't you?

17:55.400 --> 17:58.790
In Berlin, at the garden party
at General Jodl's house.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.754
Oh, yes, I do remember her.
My compliments, ma'am.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.309
Sorry. I suppose
that was obvious.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.678
But you know how mothers are.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.599
Anxious to become
mothers-in-law, I should think.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.552
A splendid officer,
no doubt of that.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.751
A mother would be proud
to see her daughter...

18:17.960 --> 18:19.757
Married to a war memorial?

18:19.960 --> 18:22.713
Excuse me, ma'am.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.435
I shall continue to study
General Tanz's plan.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.790
With sinking heart.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.400
I detest that man.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.880
What does he mean,
"with sinking heart"?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.037
Oh, the black book.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.711
What were you saying, my dear?

18:45.920 --> 18:48.150
I don't dare say anything
when you've got your book out.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.032
One must protect
one's reputation.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.356
Another mess like the one
you've made here in Warsaw

18:52.560 --> 18:54.391

a reputation to protect.

Fortunately, I still have some
influence at Supreme Headquarters.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.677
Indeed you have,
for which I am grateful.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.719
How nice that you are here at last.
I want to talk to you about Ulrike.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.276
And I want to talk to you
about the soiree tonight.

19:17.480 --> 19:21.075
I think you should know that this
morning Ulrike was extremely rude to me.

sending her, I'm not surprised.

He would like to see you.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.159
What does he want?

19:33.360 --> 19:35.078
He said it was personal.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.396
He's most persistent.

Yes, sir.

By the way, what did you do
to your uniform last night?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.471
Do? To my uniform?

19:49.680 --> 19:53.036
Yes, there was a stain
on the jacket. A red stain.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.117
But since you obviously
didn't cut yourself shaving,

19:55.320 --> 19:57.038
it could only have been lipstick.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.277
Shall I match the color with the
seductive shade Fräulein Neumaier wears?

20:00.480 --> 20:01.879
Don't be absurd.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.436
Anyway, the evidence is destroyed.
I've sent everything to be cleaned.

here now to look after you?

from downstairs, sir. He asked to see you.

He wouldn't say, sir.

I already told him, sir.

Good.

Well?

20:50.240 --> 20:51.514
Apparently, he rang
the motor pool this morning.

Wanted to see the log for last night
to see if anyone had used the car.

no information could be released

Yes. I think I have
an assignment for you.

But one which requires great courage.
Only a man who has killed...

Now, what about Chopin,
wasn't he Polish?

Yes, madam.

Well, the glory of Poland isn't
precisely what we're here to celebrate.

that perhaps we might play...

"There's no such thing
as too much Wagner. "

to find a fighting man

you're a model man in every respect.

Except one.
You've not married.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.109
May I ask why not?
No opportunity. Greatly regret it.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.709
Well, perhaps you've allowed
opportunities to slip by.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.151
My dear, General Tanz is a young man
whose life has been spent as a soldier.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.238
His generation has been denied
the pleasures of domesticity.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.000
We live in a period which makes
great demands upon us.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.397
Consequently, there is little time for
what is commonly known as private life.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.034
Quite right. Champagne, general?

27:23.240 --> 27:26.152

She's been with me over

27:33.160 --> 27:35.435
An excellent soldier.
Thank you, Father.

27:35.640 --> 27:39.030
I must say, I still find it hard to get
used to the idea of young girls in the army.

27:39.240 --> 27:43.153
We're building a new world order, and women
should not be exempt from playing their part.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.998
I knew you would understand,
general.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.270
Ulrike has now decided
to become a nurse

27:47.480 --> 27:50.836
in a military hospital run
by an order of nuns in Bavaria.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.792
We're very proud of our girl.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.877
Tell me, general, is it true
that in the battle of Leningrad

27:55.080 --> 27:58.550
you used frozen bodies instead
of sandbags for your artillery?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.797
The story is exaggerated.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.638
Oh, I am sorry.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.877
Some soldiers lie and rot
in the battlefield.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.550
I thought it most imaginative, putting
the dead to work, you might say.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.239
Nobody rots with me.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.196

about the frozen bodies.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.278
Oh, thank you, general.
Be careful.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.631
Ulrike has a most original
way of expressing herself.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.354
Needless to say, I shall
miss not having her with me.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.232
Then why let her go?

28:33.440 --> 28:36.193
Come along, general,
let's have some supper.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.152
You'll join us, too,

28:39.360 --> 28:41.999
Courage.
Is not enough.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.996
How dare you speak like that
to General Tanz?

28:48.200 --> 28:50.191
It serves you right, Mother,
for what you're doing to me.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.233
Whatever I do is for your own good.
I think only of you.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.908
Only of me?
You have changed.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.350
When did I begin
to interest you so much?

28:58.560 --> 29:00.152
Good evening.

29:00.360 --> 29:03.238
You've become vicious.
Yes, it's the war, Mother.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.829
Well, the nuns will soon
improve your manners.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.314
Suppose I refuse to go?

29:07.520 --> 29:11.354
You will be ordered to go. I have seen
to that already. You have no choice.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.199
You really are a terrible
woman, Mother.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.789
I suppose we deserve
each other.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.228
Colonel Mannheim!

29:18.440 --> 29:21.273
Good evening.
Yes, I'd love to dance with you.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.429
In my memoirs,
I keep a record of everything.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.712
Yours will be the place of honor
in the Warsaw chapter.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.876
GRAU:
General von Seidlitz-Gabler?

29:32.080 --> 29:35.311
Sir.
Oh, yes, you are Major...?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.193
Grau, Intelligence.
Under Colonel Mannheim.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.038
I tried to see you today.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.516
In fact, I tried to see each of you,
without much success, I'm afraid.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.472
I'm sorry, major, but general
officers are sometimes busy, you know?

29:45.680 --> 29:46.795
Of course.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.479
What was it you wanted
to see us about?

29:48.680 --> 29:50.955
Last night,
a prostitute was murdered.

29:51.240 --> 29:54.676
A prostitute? That's an
occupational hazard, isn't it?

29:55.720 --> 29:58.712
When you hear the details, I'm sure
you'll agree it's a unique case.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.070
Unique?
You can't be serious.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.556
We live in an age in which bodies lie
around streets like cobblestones.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.239
What's so unique
about this case?

30:06.440 --> 30:07.953
All right, all right,
come to the point, major.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.115
Last night, a woman
was murdered.

30:09.320 --> 30:13.233
Yes, general, in Bulkowa Street,
number 27, fourth-floor apartment,

30:13.440 --> 30:18.036
Maria Kupiecka, a prostitute,
also one of our agents.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.630
She was stabbed to death most
brutally. Cut to pieces, in fact.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.230
A charming story.
But what has that to do with us?

30:25.440 --> 30:28.955
Preliminary investigation has
established that each of you was...

30:29.160 --> 30:32.277
well, unaccounted
for last night.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.914
To whom should we be
accountable, major?

30:35.120 --> 30:37.236
I fail to see what my...

30:37.440 --> 30:41.718
What our movements should have to do
with you or with this woman's death.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.753
Well, the murderer was seen
leaving the woman's room.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.951
In that case,
you must know who he is.

30:47.680 --> 30:52.390
Not exactly. The face was not
visible, but the uniform was.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.478
It was the uniform
of a German officer.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.353
In fact, a German general.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.589
This is a serious charge.
I hope you know what you're doing.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.789
Oh, yes, sir, my duty.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.592
Then consider your duty
done, major. Good night.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.110
Are you, by any chance,
using perfume?

31:12.320 --> 31:15.551
I occasionally use a strong
eau de cologne after shaving.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.432
Good night, sir.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.758
I will, of course, want to see each of
you tomorrow, if I may, in line of duty.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.632
It is quite possible
we've been misled,

31:23.840 --> 31:26.991
but we don't want to leave
any loose ends dangling, do we?

31:27.200 --> 31:30.078
Until tomorrow.
Good night, generals.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.835
Astonishing behavior!

31:34.040 --> 31:36.110
Who invited him?
Not I.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.153
Socially, Major Grau
has not been a success.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.918
I'm sorry, general.
I should have had him arrested.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.510
Why? He was merely
doing his duty.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.913
Yes.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.633
Well...

31:49.080 --> 31:52.356
Now, there are some officers
I should like to present to you.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.151
Some sauerbraten, general?

32:02.560 --> 32:04.790
Make yourself comfortable,
inspector.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.877
This is my third restaurant
in Berlin.

32:07.080 --> 32:10.993
That's if you count the sausage shop I had
down by the station right after the war.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.236
We were really on our arse then.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.876
Now look, Germany is booming.
We made it.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.594
Well, come along, inspector,
do sit down.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.590
One large Munchen, please.

32:22.880 --> 32:27.556
Now, then, you asked me
about General Kahlenberge.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.150
Well, I don't suppose there was
anyone who knew him better than me.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.278
Hartmann's doing
a good job, isn't he, sir?

32:34.480 --> 32:37.074
Yes. What?

32:37.280 --> 32:40.511
Oh, yes! Apparently.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.836
OTTO: <i>Of course, inspector,</i>
<i>as I said before,</i>

32:43.040 --> 32:45.395
<i>I haven't seen Hartmann</i>
<i>since the war. </i>

32:45.600 --> 32:48.478
<i>Don't want to see him,</i>
<i>after what he did. </i>

32:48.680 --> 32:52.992
<i>But I'll say one thing, he had the most</i>
<i>extraordinary effect on women. </i>

32:53.200 --> 32:54.599
<i>I don't know why. </i>

32:54.800 --> 32:57.872
<i>Well, he wasn't what you'd call</i>
<i>really handsome. </i>

32:58.080 --> 32:59.559
<i>Too skinny. </i>

32:59.760 --> 33:03.548
<i>But whatever it was he had,</i>
<i>it work ed out all right with women. </i>

33:03.760 --> 33:06.558
<i>I think they must have</i> <i>got together
almost from</i> <i>the first moment they met. </i>

33:06.760 --> 33:08.637
<i>Well, things were like that</i>
<i>in the war. </i>

33:08.840 --> 33:13.197
<i>I remember once in Paris,</i>
<i>meeting this girl in the Metro. </i>

33:13.440 --> 33:16.159
<i>Well, anyway, you didn't waste time,</i>
<i>not with knowing maybe tomorrow</i>

33:16.360 --> 33:19.716
<i>you'd be sent to the fronts or</i> <i>the
damned Allies would drop</i> <i>a bomb on you. </i>

33:19.920 --> 33:22.354
<i>Oh, worry, I didn't mean that</i>
<i>about the Allies. </i>

33:22.560 --> 33:24.915
<i>After all, where would we be now</i>
<i>without Americans?</i>

33:25.120 --> 33:28.430
Nice.
I'd forgotten how nice.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.517
Would you say there
were no girls in Russia?

33:30.720 --> 33:34.190
Girls? I was too scared.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.438
I'm hopeless when I'm scared.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.437
Well, it's a good thing
I don't scare you, isn't it?

33:38.640 --> 33:43.077
Yes, it's just that this room
makes me nervous.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.429
Nervous?
Mm.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.710
Oh, you have no sense of history.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.434
Do you realize this used to be
the bed of the king of Poland.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.755
Did it really?
Mm-hm.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.234
It's like sleeping on the floor.

33:52.440 --> 33:53.793
It's freezing in here.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.197
Ah, but the king and the queen
never slept. They just made love.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.356
They were never cold.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.638
Do you like the war?

34:05.600 --> 34:06.999
Do I like the war?

34:07.200 --> 34:09.395
Good God, no. Do you?

34:10.760 --> 34:14.958
If it weren't for the war, I'd be on the
marriage circuit now, living on some army post,

34:15.159 --> 34:17.549
making conversation
with dreary young officers.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.672
Instead of making love
with dreary young corporals.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.270
Oh, not dreary. Not at all.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.315
In fact, the best so far.
Oh?

34:27.520 --> 34:30.080
Do you specialize in corporals?
No.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.315
Only heroes like you.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.871
Just think, all this bravery
in my arms.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.355
It must be very inspiring.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.196
What's the matter?

34:44.400 --> 34:46.038
You know, we mustn't like
each other too much.

34:46.239 --> 34:49.391
Why? Because I'm a corporal
and you're a general's daughter?

34:49.600 --> 34:53.114
No. It's because...

34:54.520 --> 34:57.557
It's a man, a girl, a war.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.952
Two boys I knew
are already dead in Russia.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.878
It's funny.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.355
In the dark,
you feel just like them to me.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.152
And you like this war?

35:08.360 --> 35:12.239
No. I like this.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.796
[CLOCK CHIMES]

35:38.440 --> 35:40.032
[ENGINE BACKFIRES]

35:40.240 --> 35:41.878
No, no!

35:42.080 --> 35:43.479
What's wrong?

35:45.360 --> 35:48.238
Nothing. I thought
they were firing at me.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.795
You're shaking like a leaf.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.831
I'm all right now.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.754
What's it like having people
try to kill you?

36:02.960 --> 36:05.235
Noisy bastards.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.078
Good morning.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.430
Good morning,
king of Poland.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.674
What's it like having people
try to kill you?

36:16.880 --> 36:19.394
Well, what do you think it's like?
Terrible.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.318
Yes.

36:21.520 --> 36:22.919
I'm glad...

36:23.120 --> 36:26.271
Well, I'm glad that you're here.
So am I.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.391
But you'll be going back soon,
I suppose?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.989
Not if I can help it, I won't.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.351
Can you bear the truth?

36:33.560 --> 36:34.754
Probably not.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.236
I'm a fraud.
Impossible.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.796
When they opened fire on us
at Voronezh, I ran away.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.956
It's as simple as that.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.835
Then, I've no idea how, I was hit.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.953
It was like a door slamming in
my head, and I thought I was dead.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.151
Next thing I remember
waking up in the hospital

36:54.360 --> 36:56.954
and there was this general
congratulating me

36:57.160 --> 37:00.436
on having killed 40 Russians
single-handed.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.950
You see, they were all killed
that day, the whole company.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.993
Everyone was killed except me,
and I suppose

37:07.200 --> 37:10.317
it didn't look too good in dispatches,
a whole company being wiped out,

37:10.520 --> 37:13.318
so they decided
to make a hero of the survivor.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.158
The one who ran away.

37:15.360 --> 37:19.273
So now what do you think
of all that bravery?

37:22.520 --> 37:25.318
Well, that's a lovely story.
I think it's marvelous.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.633
Marvelous?
Yes.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.195
For once, the joke's on them.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.039
Come, make love
to the queen of Poland.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.710
I must say you are,
well, unexpected.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.150
It's lucky we met.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.995
What's lucky is right now.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.952
You know, when this war is over...

37:45.160 --> 37:47.151
Mm-mm. It will never end.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.434
Well, what happened?

37:54.640 --> 37:55.959
Did you see them?

37:56.160 --> 38:00.073
Generals Gabler and Kahlenberge are
in conference and cannot be disturbed.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.077
I told you they wouldn't see you.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.599
Where's General Tanz?

38:03.800 --> 38:05.028
Look, why don't
we forget about this?

38:05.240 --> 38:06.878
It's not as if we don't have
other things to do.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.071
Where's General Tanz?

38:09.280 --> 38:11.953
In the old city, conducting
a tactical exercise.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.274
I don't trust him.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.311
Naturally, in the field,
he must use his discretion.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.636
He has no discretion.
He is ruthless.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.273
Now, now, you exaggerate.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.278
He will only go to phase two if phase
one should prove to be a failure.

38:49.480 --> 38:50.515
What is a failure?

38:50.720 --> 38:52.119
Well, if the Poles, the Jews
try to retaliate.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.710
What constitutes retaliation,
a rock thrown at his golden head?

38:55.920 --> 38:58.275
Is that sufficient warrant
for the demolition of the city?

38:58.480 --> 39:00.550
You always overstate things,
Kahlenberge.

I'll take care of him.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.028
You wanted to see me, general.
Yes, yes.

Yes, I did, colonel.
I wanted to see you about...

Yes.

Yes, I remember now.

You have an officer on
your staff, a Major Grau.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.434
This is Wehrmacht's radio unit

government of Poland.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.719
This broadcast is coming to you
directly from Warsaw.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.117
A few yards from where I am, I see
General Tanz, the hero of Leningrad.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.073
He is conducting maneuvers
in the streets of the city.

41:45.280 --> 41:49.876
An entire area is being temporarily evacuated
in the interest of public order and safety.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.275
Sector one reports
phase one successful.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.199
Sector three,
no resistance encountered.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.158
Thank you, Sandauer.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.271
ANNOUNCER: The soldiers, of course,
are dedicated to their commander.

41:59.480 --> 42:01.550
He is a superb craftsman of war

42:01.760 --> 42:05.799
and his presence alone inspires
men to extraordinary valor.

42:06.000 --> 42:09.629
The exercise is being carried out with
meticulous precision according to plan.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.479
The population is extremely
cooperative and friendly.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.557
SANDAUER: Sector four
reports phase one operative.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.591
Sector two,

Phase one to continue
until further orders.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.278
Yes, sir.

42:21.480 --> 42:25.393
All sectors, from commanding general,
phase one to continue until further orders.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.398
Main sector, flamethrowers ready, sir.
Go ahead.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.192
Forward march.

Phase two, sir?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.230
Stand by for phase two.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.237
Yes, sir.

Now the major
may put his questions.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.558
He's gone, sir.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.750
That maniac is blowing up
half the city.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.113
Let's go.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.790
Did you say there was
no real resistance?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.353
No, I was there.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.757
One shot from one sniper, that
was all, and he blows up the city!

44:51.960 --> 44:54.349
Now, now,
we're not the generals.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.028
It is their business,
you know, not ours.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.038
We're here just
to keep the papers moving.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.677
And yours have arrived.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.199
Congratulations.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.674
For what?

45:05.880 --> 45:08.599
You've been promoted
to lieutenant colonel.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.835
Promoted?

45:10.040 --> 45:12.349
And transferred to Paris
as of this date.

45:12.560 --> 45:15.996
Lucky fellow.
Transferred, but why?

45:16.200 --> 45:18.156
Who signed the transfer?

45:18.360 --> 45:20.351
General Gabler, naturally.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.034
What are you doing?

45:26.240 --> 45:28.276
I'm going to find out
where the order originated.

45:28.480 --> 45:32.871
On whose recommendation here.
Calm down. I've already checked.

45:33.880 --> 45:37.156
General Kahlenberge.
He recommended your transfer.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.395
Did he indeed?

45:38.600 --> 45:40.955
You must have made
quite an impression last night.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.549
It would seem so.
Thank you, colonel.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.717
It's just as well, you know.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.672
That's a matter of opinion.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.395
Above all, Major Grau,
not too much zeal.

45:52.600 --> 45:56.195
I have a zealous nature,
sir. I can't help it.

46:02.680 --> 46:06.195
Yes, inspector, I was
in Warsaw with General Tanz.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.356
And I resent those
cheap journalists

46:08.560 --> 46:12.838
who try to make him out to be some
sort of inhuman monster. He was not.

Forgive me, inspector. We hire
a lot of foreigners nowadays.

We can't get Germans
any more, not for real work.

46:21.840 --> 46:25.879
I've seen General Tanz in the field,
with the wounded, the dying.

46:26.080 --> 46:29.516
He was extraordinary.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.711
Compassionate, gentle.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.911
Do you know that after Leningrad,

46:34.120 --> 46:37.715
Hitler ordered the general
not to expose himself to enemy fire.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.549
Of course, he found this a great
hardship. He was only happy in battle.

will be automated.

46:52.880 --> 46:55.189
Except the manager, of course.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.757
And then in July 1944,
we were transferred to Paris.

46:59.960 --> 47:02.349
The Allies were
in Normandy by then

47:02.560 --> 47:05.757
and Hitler ordered us to stop them
in front of Paris.

47:05.960 --> 47:09.191
We nearly did too, except that
the army was betrayed, as usual.

But we mustn't talk politics.
It's bad for business, isn't it?

47:12.560 --> 47:14.391
You asked me about Paris.

has been advancing towards the left,

trying to cut off two of our panzer
divisions from our main supply route.

the enemy has succeeded

49:16.320 --> 49:19.232
in crossing the Ohm River,
here and here.

However, we were able
to stop them here,

it's inconvenient for you.

than that. Why?

three days earlier than was planned?

a few days off to play a little too.

After all that you've been through, my dear
general, these past few months in Russia,

I know it must have been
perfect hell for you.

Meanwhile, why don't you
take a few days off?

51:22.080 --> 51:25.038
Rest a bit, see the sights
of Paris. It's your first visit.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.710
I want only combat troops,
no decaying old men or children.

Yes, sir. We are making good
progress, General Kahlenberge and I.

51:31.920 --> 51:34.434
After all, it may be your
last chance to see Paris.

51:34.640 --> 51:37.438
It may be anyone's
last chance. Such a pity.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.789
A necessity.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.877
But of course.
Of course it's necessary.

Stern measures, the only thing
people respect.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.317

you leave everything to us.

You'll have a car, a driver and
whatever else strikes your fancy.

51:57.120 --> 52:01.238
One must relax occasionally, general.
I can't afford to.

52:01.440 --> 52:05.399
You give me no alternative
but to compel you to enjoy yourself.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.272
Must I order you?

52:07.480 --> 52:10.870
Because if I must,
I'm afraid I shall have to.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.433
Yes, sir.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.949
Evidently, you are not
ready for me.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.078
Very well.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.874
I shall devote one day
to seeing the city.

Come and have dinner with
me and Eleanore tomorrow.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.513

This is bad luck.

52:37.720 --> 52:41.429
Naturally, she forgot to say
which train she'd be on.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.272
I assume you are with us now.
In spirit, of course, but...

52:45.480 --> 52:48.358
You'll have to make up
your mind. Soon.

52:48.560 --> 52:52.872
Making up one's mind is one
thing, speaking it is another.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.877
You worry too much.

52:57.320 --> 53:01.313
Patience is one of
the few virtues that I possess.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.719
At ease.

53:03.920 --> 53:07.754
Sergeant, get me the military
governor's office on the telephone.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.631

governor's office.

Yes, sir.

He may want to go out at night.

53:39.120 --> 53:42.669
Do you know anything which
might interest General Tanz?

53:42.960 --> 53:45.269
Nightclubs or girls,
that sort of thing.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.629
A few, sir.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.354
But I don't really know
what the general's taste is, sir.

Let us hope that whatever it is,
it is not you, corporal.

53:52.880 --> 53:56.953
However, if it should be, remember
that you're serving the fatherland.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.752
I'll try to remember, sir.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.918
Should he ask you to take him to his
headquarters, you are to telephone me.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.350
Either here or at my hotel.
Yes, sir.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.472
You'll report to Colonel Sandauer
for specific instructions.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.119
Sir?

54:11.320 --> 54:13.038
What is it, corporal?

54:13.760 --> 54:17.355
I'm sorry, but I was supposed to have
a 24-hour leave starting tomorrow.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.596
That's impossible.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.150
Could I have one hour free
in the morning, sir?

54:22.360 --> 54:23.873
No.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.713
Sir.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.638
Hartmann?
Sir?

54:31.400 --> 54:32.879
This is important.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.793
All right.
Now, where were we?

54:38.000 --> 54:40.468
Oh, yes. Childhood diseases?

54:40.880 --> 54:42.677
Measles.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.996
I can't remember.
Nothing serious, I think.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.553
Chickenpox.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.352
Bed-wetting?

54:49.280 --> 54:52.511
No, sir.
Fear of the dark?

54:52.720 --> 54:54.119
No, not particularly.

54:54.320 --> 54:56.231
Venereal disease?

54:57.680 --> 54:59.875
No, sir.
Good.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.878
Now, what about books?
Books?

55:03.080 --> 55:05.469
Do you read books?
Yes, sir, I read books.

55:05.680 --> 55:09.434
What?
<i>War and Peace. </i>

55:09.640 --> 55:11.596
Nietzsche,
<i>The Decline of the West</i>.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.997
Books on psychology,
pathology?

55:15.600 --> 55:17.192
No, not much.

55:17.400 --> 55:19.356
Show me your hands.

55:26.200 --> 55:29.476
All right. Now, you'll have a room
assigned to you in the general's hotel.

55:29.680 --> 55:32.194
He'll want to see
the principal sights of Paris.

55:32.400 --> 55:35.790
You will prepare an itinerary
and submit it to me.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.118
When not in the field,
the general goes to bed at 11:45.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.595
He seldom drinks or smokes,

55:42.800 --> 55:45.553
so you will probably have
an early evening.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.991
Now, this is my private number,

55:49.200 --> 55:50.872
in case you should need me.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.593
Need you, sir?

55:52.800 --> 55:56.588
If anything out of the ordinary
should happen, ring me immediately.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.109
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.958
Good luck.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.312
Thank you, sir.

56:06.480 --> 56:12.635
Incidentally, avoid all cemeteries,
tombs, any mention of death.

56:14.120 --> 56:15.394
Yes, sir.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.034
Sir?

56:25.240 --> 56:27.879
Inspector Morand, please.
Third floor, room 158.

56:28.080 --> 56:31.675
Who shall I say is here?
Thank you. I can find my own way.

56:35.120 --> 56:39.238
[SPEAKS FRENCH]

56:43.880 --> 56:46.633
Welcome, Colonel Grau,
to the spider's web.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.114
How did you know it was me?

56:48.320 --> 56:50.675
What other German colonel
would enter unannounced?

56:50.880 --> 56:53.235
Almost any SS colonel would.

56:53.440 --> 56:55.590
Actually, I saw you reflected
in the window.

56:55.800 --> 56:58.712
Impossible, it's too dirty.

56:58.920 --> 57:02.196
I hope you're not allergic to dust.
Old crimes, colonel.

57:02.400 --> 57:05.597
They generate
a good deal of dust.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.915
Unsolved crimes.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.671
The dust has settled.

57:11.880 --> 57:14.189
We can always unsettle it.

57:15.080 --> 57:18.152
Is that why you came?
Do sit down, colonel.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.079
I must apologize for the heat,
but it's nearly August,

57:21.280 --> 57:23.157
when most Parisians
leave Paris.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.999
Let's hope Germans have
the good sense to do the same.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.873
Saint-Lô fell to the Allies
this morning.

57:29.080 --> 57:31.116
BBC?

57:31.320 --> 57:33.595
Coffee?
No, thank you.

57:34.920 --> 57:38.276
You have dossiers
on everyone, don't you?

57:38.480 --> 57:41.597
On everyone interesting.
German as well as French?

57:41.800 --> 57:44.792
At the specific request
of German Intelligence,

57:45.000 --> 57:49.232
we keep an occasional eye
on interesting Germans.

57:49.440 --> 57:50.873
Like me?

57:51.080 --> 57:55.198
I have always found you interesting.
Thank you.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.311
What about German generals?

57:58.240 --> 58:00.879
Well, what about them?

58:01.080 --> 58:03.548
Generals are interesting?

58:03.760 --> 58:07.548
Then, to the degree that they are
interesting, we keep an eye on them too.

58:07.760 --> 58:12.038
Good. Here are the names of three generals.
I want to know everything about them.

58:12.240 --> 58:14.231
Everything may be too much.

58:14.440 --> 58:16.476
What specifically
are you looking for?

58:16.680 --> 58:20.150
One of them is a murderer.

58:20.360 --> 58:21.952
Only one?

58:22.160 --> 58:25.038
But murder is the occupation
of generals.

58:25.240 --> 58:30.792
Let's say what is admirable on the
large scale is monstrous on the small.

58:31.960 --> 58:35.032
Since we must give medals
to mass murderers,

58:35.240 --> 58:38.994
let us try to give justice
to the small entrepreneur.

58:39.200 --> 58:43.512
Nicely put. I shall be glad
to help you if I can.

58:43.720 --> 58:47.759
I realize that nothing is free in
this world, even between colleagues.

58:47.960 --> 58:49.678
Especially between colleagues.

58:49.880 --> 58:51.632
In exchange
for your information,

58:51.840 --> 58:56.356
I shall arrange for the release from
prison of three French resistance.

58:56.560 --> 58:58.198
Thank you.

58:58.400 --> 59:02.109
Have you a favorite suspect?
Not really, no.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.833
You see, on the night
of the murder,

59:04.040 --> 59:06.793
each general
had something to conceal.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.468
The night of the murder was...?

59:09.680 --> 59:12.990
December the 12th,
1942, Warsaw.

59:13.200 --> 59:17.193
And just as I started my investigation,
I was transferred to Paris.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.630
By the murderer?
Possibly.

59:19.840 --> 59:22.354
For two years, I've wanted
to reopen the case.

59:22.560 --> 59:25.836
Now I can. As of today,
all three are in Paris.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.758
General Gabler.

59:27.960 --> 59:30.235
He's partial to the sort
of girl who was killed.

59:30.440 --> 59:33.876
Oh, a girl. A crime
of passion, as we say.

59:34.080 --> 59:37.755
Passion, yes, but only in the sense
of your distinguished Marquis de Sade.

59:37.960 --> 59:43.478
Oh, a sex crime, I see.
Is that why this case excites you?

59:43.720 --> 59:46.109
The girl was also
a German agent.

59:46.320 --> 59:49.153
She may have been killed
because of something she knew.

59:49.360 --> 59:52.033
That's why Kahlenberge
intrigues me the most.

59:52.240 --> 59:54.913
He seems to have no private life

59:55.120 --> 59:57.350
and yet he disappears
from time to time.

59:57.560 --> 59:59.915
No one knows where or why.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.758
And General Tanz?

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.234
A perfect maniac.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.514
<i>I saw him destroy</i> <i>an entire quarter of
Warsaw</i> <i>for the sheer pleasure of it. </i>

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:12.076
<i>On the Eastern front,</i>
<i>he was known as The Butcher. </i>

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.794
<i>He lost most of his division</i>
<i>in Russia. </i>

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.117
<i>He revels in death. </i>
<i>Which is why, in a curious way,</i>

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.993
<i>I don't think he's the man</i>
<i>I'm looking for. </i>

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.749
<i>Anyone who has the power to destroy</i>
<i>a city whenever he chooses</i>

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.191
<i>does not need such minor sport</i>
<i>as killing a girl. </i>

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.799
<i>I could be wrong, of course. </i>

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.078
Hartmann?
Yes.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.238
I'm Sergeant Kopatski,
the general's orderly.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.873
For the time being, that is.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.789
I forgot to take his laces out before
cleaning his shoes this morning.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.638
For God's sake,
where are your gloves?

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.400
You'll get finger marks on it.
I haven't got gloves.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.716
They never told me.
Take mine.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.400
These are the general's
holiday rations.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.718
One bottle of cognac, one Thermos
of coffee at 40 degrees centigrade,

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.273
two hundred cigarettes.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.391
Does the general drink?

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.955
Like a sponge,
only he never shows it.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.832
Put the briefcase
on the back seat.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.632
On the right side.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.354
Whenever he leaves the car,
clean out the ashtrays.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.073
He smokes like a chimney.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.032
Clean everything in sight.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.276
Clean everything out of sight,

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.799
including the engine.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.878
If you don't, he'll tear
your head off.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.355
It's now one second to 9:00.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.516
Here he comes.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.634
I've given him full
instructions, sir.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.274
Name?
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal, sir.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.755
Show the general your hands.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.672
Well, don't stand there like a fool.
Put your gloves on.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.835
He seems to know Paris.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.315
He's prepared an itinerary of the
sights of the city. I have endorsed it.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.078
I shall see you tomorrow morning
at headquarters.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.235
Yes, general.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.953
Sergeant Kopatski
is relieved as my orderly.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.879
This morning he smeared
polish on my shoelaces.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.833
Fourteen days confined to barracks.
Yes, general.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.831
We've just passed
the Place Vendôme, sir.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.636
The column is 142 feet high
and was erected in 1810.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.879
It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon
captured at Austerlitz.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.638
There's a statue of Napoleon
on the top.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.632
In front of us, sir,
the Tuileries Gardens.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.913
The Tuileries Palace used to be
in the middle of the gardens.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.633
In 1792, at the time
of the French Revolution,

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.716
the Paris mob attacked
the palace,

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.912
forcing the king and queen
to escape.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.394
It was burnt down in...

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.318
in 1871.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.595
We are now coming
into Place de la Concorde.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.156
One of the most beautiful squares
in Paris.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.516
It was here, in the middle
of the square

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.030
that Louis XVI
and Marie Antoinette

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.794
were beheaded
during the revolution.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.919
The guillotine was there, in the
centre, where the obelisk is now.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.037
Keep your eye
on the road, corporal.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.878
Yes, sir.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.910
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.479
Fräulein Gabler?
Yes.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.592
I'm Sergeant Kopke
from your father's headquarters.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.077
How did they know
which train I was on?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.599
They didn't.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.518
May I?

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.679
You see, I'm Hartmann's cousin.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.872
We got no secrets, Hartmann and me.
More like brothers, really.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.311
He's all right, isn't he?
All right? Never better.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.149
No, it's just at the last moment he
was assigned to drive General Tanz.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.511
Only for today. That's
why he couldn't meet you.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.551
Well, how are things
in the fatherland?

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.830
Any cities left
after all the bombing?

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.474
A few, yes, here and there.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.956
There's one good thing about Paris.
It's an open city, no bombs.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.230
I hate bombs.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.069
This way, Fräulein Gabler.
I have a car for you just outside.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.077
I'll take you
to your father's hotel.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.998
Hartmann's staying there too.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.033
With General Tanz,
just for tonight.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.675
So I suppose you'll run
into him sooner or later,

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.757
in the lobby or something.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.155
The gallery is shut
to the public, sir.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.955
But special permission has been
granted for you to see the paintings.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.196
Most of them have been
confiscated and assembled here

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.595
before being sent to Germany.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.192
General Tanz.
You've been notified.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.597
Yes, corporal.
Here's all the information.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.636
On your right, sir,
paintings by Boucher,

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.149
the 18th-century
French master.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.396
All these paintings
have been selected

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.273
for <i>Reichsmarschall</i> Goering.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.118
What's in there?

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.150
Paintings requisitioned from private
collections by the <i>reichsmarshcall. </i>
