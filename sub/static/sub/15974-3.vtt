<i>Man on TV: Leaving them just
2 yards shy of the first down,</i>

44:35.707 --> 44:37.436
<i>and, Bob Palmero,
what do you do</i>

44:37.509 --> 44:39.944
<i>if you're the Florida State
Seminoles in this situation?</i>

44:40.011 --> 44:41.740
<i>Bob:
Well, Bobby Bowden</i> --

44:41.813 --> 44:42.712
He's gonna go for it.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.214
He's gonna
kick the field goal.

44:44.282 --> 44:45.977
No, he's gonna go
for the first down.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.108
Well, they got to score
twice to win.

44:47.185 --> 44:48.243
Why not just get
the three right now?

44:48.319 --> 44:49.548
He's got the wind
at his back.

44:49.621 --> 44:50.645
He doesn't have the leg.

44:50.722 --> 44:51.746
He's got the wind
at his back.

44:51.823 --> 44:54.292
I don't care if he's got the wind at
his back and a song in his heart.

44:54.359 --> 44:55.793
He doesn't have the leg.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.328
You're a crazy man
from St. Louis.

44:57.395 --> 44:58.954
You have no business
being in sports.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.361
-- Jeremy.
-- Yes, sir?

45:00.431 --> 45:04.061
Florida State, fourth and 2
on the Purdue 39 and down by 9.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.365
What's Bowden gonna do,
kick or play?

45:06.437 --> 45:07.905
I really don't know.

45:07.972 --> 45:10.339
-- <i>I'm asking what you think.</i>
-- <i>It'd just be</i> a <i>guess.</i>

45:10.408 --> 45:12.069
-- I <i>want you to guess.</i>
-- <i>I don't like to guess.</i>

45:12.143 --> 45:13.269
Guess anyway.

45:13.344 --> 45:14.675
-- Come on, come on.
-- Why?

45:14.746 --> 45:17.010
Because this is fun.
The job should be fun.

45:17.081 --> 45:18.913
I'm having fun.

45:18.983 --> 45:21.247
-- <i>You should have more.</i>
-- <i>I'm having</i> a <i>lot of fun.</i>

45:21.319 --> 45:23.481
-- <i>Jeremy!</i>
-- <i>I'm having tons of fun!</i>

45:23.555 --> 45:24.818
Guess!

45:24.889 --> 45:26.084
All right, fine.

45:26.157 --> 45:27.647
He's gonna split
three wide receivers

45:27.725 --> 45:30.194
and put a tight end in the backfield
with the tailback in motion.

45:30.261 --> 45:32.059
<i>A play-action fake
will freeze the strong safety,</i>

45:32.130 --> 45:34.792
<i>and Kittis will find his primary
receiver over the middle.</i>

45:34.866 --> 45:37.267
It's a play called Red Rocket
right, slant 42, “Z“ out.

45:37.335 --> 45:39.303
He'll get the first down,
probably a lot more.

45:39.370 --> 45:40.769
What, are you insane?

45:40.838 --> 45:42.533
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
they're not kicking.

45:42.607 --> 45:44.871
<i>Kittis lines up under center
with three wide receivers split</i>

45:44.943 --> 45:46.069
<i>and the tight end
in the backfield.</i>

45:46.144 --> 45:48.272
<i>Tailback in motion,
the play-action fake,</i>

45:48.346 --> 45:51.475
<i>and Kittis has Renfro over the
middle for the first down and more!</i>

45:51.549 --> 45:53.847
<i>First and 10,
Florida State on the 16!</i>

45:53.918 --> 45:55.317
<i>Incredible!</i>

45:55.386 --> 45:57.650
<i>Bob: That's a play
Coach Bowden's got called</i>

45:57.722 --> 46:01.590
<i>Red Rocket right,
slant 42, "Z" out.</i>

46:04.095 --> 46:06.962
You take a lot of the fun
out of this, Jeremy.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.432
<i>Newporfs gonna put up
a challenge,</i>

46:12.503 --> 46:14.062
New Zealand and Australia
each have new keels,

46:14.138 --> 46:15.731
and Japan's looking
for an American tactician,

46:15.807 --> 46:17.639
maybe even a whole new
after guard.

46:17.709 --> 46:20.906
Now, interestingly, Italy
has developed a new 140% Genoa,

46:20.979 --> 46:22.413
but the IRC
says it may not meet specs

46:22.480 --> 46:24.244
because of a bolt
in the back step.

46:24.315 --> 46:27.012
Honest to God, I have no idea
what sport you're talking about.

46:27.085 --> 46:29.019
Dan's talking about
the rough-and-tumble,

46:29.087 --> 46:31.078
livin'-the-razor's-edge,
run-till-you-drop,

46:31.155 --> 46:33.214
never-say-die world
of offshore yacht racing.

46:33.291 --> 46:35.555
<i>Time for the America's Cup?</i>

46:35.627 --> 46:37.061
We're only a year
and a half away.

46:37.128 --> 46:37.890
I don't want to get scooped,

46:37.962 --> 46:40.294
but we can probably
postpone our coverage

46:40.365 --> 46:42.891
for, I guess, like,
a year and a half, can't we?

46:42.967 --> 46:45.561
<i>Greatest sport in the world, Dana,
greatest sport. Great for kids.</i>

46:45.637 --> 46:48.106
<i>All you need is $40 million
and a dream.</i>

46:48.172 --> 46:49.367
On the NHL --

46:49.440 --> 46:50.635
"I must go down
to the sea again,

46:50.708 --> 46:52.301
"to the lonely sea
and the sky,

46:52.377 --> 46:55.210
to the flung spume and
the blown spray and the --"

46:55.279 --> 46:57.008
I don't know --
thing in my eye.

46:57.081 --> 46:58.446
Thank you.

46:58.516 --> 47:00.780
That was a poem
by Mr. Henry David Thoreau.

47:00.852 --> 47:02.115
It's Wordsworth.

47:02.186 --> 47:03.449
Or Wordsworth.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.546
-- Uh, it might be Whitman.
-- Might <i>be</i> Byron.

47:05.623 --> 47:07.057
-- It's not Byron.
-- I think it is Whitman.

47:07.125 --> 47:08.388
-- <i>Okay.</i>
-- <i>It is not Whitman.</i>

47:08.459 --> 47:10.086
-- I <i>think it is.</i>
-- <i>It's not Walt Whitman.</i>

47:10.161 --> 47:12.255
Well, I'm saying I think
it's Slim Whitman.

47:12.330 --> 47:15.766
<i>Fellas, we have
10 NHL games, 8 NBA,</i>

47:15.833 --> 47:17.267
two of them
on the West Coast,

47:17.335 --> 47:19.269
so let's stay in business
on 30 through 50.

47:19.337 --> 47:22.034
<i>Edmonton's at Calgary, and we'll
pick it up on the 2:00 A.M.</i>

47:22.106 --> 47:23.267
-- Can I say something?
-- Sure.

47:23.341 --> 47:25.070
There's a chance
it might be Dylan Thomas.

47:25.143 --> 47:28.579
You have to imagine, Danny, how much I
don't give a damn about blown spume.

47:28.646 --> 47:30.637
It's <i>flung</i> spume
and <i>blown</i> spray,

47:30.715 --> 47:32.080
but, actually,
I like your way better.

47:32.150 --> 47:34.448
Elliott, Kim,
I'm gonna need some people

47:34.519 --> 47:36.385
to triple up on games tonight.

47:36.454 --> 47:38.115
-- I can do it. -- You're
not gonna <i>be</i> available.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.214
-- Why not? -- We're gonna
talk to you about it later.

47:40.291 --> 47:41.816
Meet us in Isaac's office
right after lunch.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.884
-- Is Jeremy getting the call?
-- <i>He's</i> getting the <i>call.</i>

47:43.961 --> 47:45.895
-- I'm getting the call?
-- You're getting the call.

47:45.963 --> 47:47.522
-- I don't know what that means. --
It means you're getting the call.

47:47.598 --> 47:48.292
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

47:48.366 --> 47:49.595
I still don't know
what that means.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.999
<i>Isaac's office after lunch.
Meantime</i> --

47:52.070 --> 47:53.037
<i>I'm sorry, I'm just</i> --

47:53.104 --> 47:55.596
ls getting the call,
you know, good?

47:57.308 --> 47:58.776
Better than a poke in the eye.

47:58.843 --> 48:00.072
-- Really?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

48:00.144 --> 48:02.010
How much better?

48:02.080 --> 48:03.411
We'll talk about it
after lunch.

48:04.115 --> 48:06.140
Natalie's got a memo
from downstairs

48:06.217 --> 48:07.651
about next Thursday night.

48:07.719 --> 48:10.552
Just a note from the P.R. office
that the reception's black tie.

48:10.621 --> 48:12.487
The cars will pick you up
after the show

48:12.557 --> 48:14.321
and wait for you
at the Four Seasons.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.827
Is "next Thursday"
this Thursday or next Thursday?

48:16.894 --> 48:18.521
-- This Thursday.
-- Dana <i>said</i> next Thursday.

48:18.596 --> 48:20.428
This coming Thursday.
Today is Monday.

48:20.498 --> 48:22.364
Three days from now,
it'll be Thursday.

48:22.433 --> 48:25.733
We knew what today was, we just
didn't know what Thursday was.

48:26.871 --> 48:28.361
-- It's Thursday.
-- Got it.

48:28.439 --> 48:31.636
Look, can I ask again? Is it absolutely
necessary that we participate in this?

48:31.709 --> 48:33.108
-- Yes.
-- Yes, I can ask again --

48:33.177 --> 48:34.474
You have to go.

48:34.545 --> 48:36.707
Luther Sachs expects us
to get off the air at midnight,

48:36.781 --> 48:39.216
change our clothes, hop in a
car, and go to his ootillion?

48:39.283 --> 48:40.375
Reception.

48:40.451 --> 48:42.545
These are pretty ornate
invitations for a reception.

48:42.620 --> 48:43.781
What are you wearing?

48:43.855 --> 48:46.552
-- The black Richard Tyler.
-- You're fine.

48:46.624 --> 48:50.788
<i>"October the 8th, 1998, A.D."</i>

48:50.862 --> 48:53.661
A.D. They're worried
I might accidentally show up

48:53.731 --> 48:55.324
2,000 years before
the birth of Christ.

48:55.399 --> 48:56.958
[Laughter]

48:57.034 --> 48:59.230
A half-hour -- you have a drink,
you have a thing,

48:59.303 --> 49:01.135
they take your picture,
you're out of there.

49:01.205 --> 49:02.468
-- This Thursday?
-- Yes.

49:02.540 --> 49:03.837
What shoes are you wearing?

49:03.908 --> 49:05.933
Whatever shoes
are on my feet.

49:06.010 --> 49:07.375
-- I was talking to Dana.
-- What the hell --

49:08.279 --> 49:09.678
Manolo Blahniks.

49:09.747 --> 49:11.841
-- Black silk sling-backs?
-- Yeah.

49:11.916 --> 49:12.712
Good.

49:13.584 --> 49:15.814
Thank you, Coco Chanel.

49:17.255 --> 49:18.984
Bumpers in and out
of commercial 6,

49:19.056 --> 49:21.150
we're holding on
the Pete Sampras announcement,

49:21.225 --> 49:23.091
and Mike Maravich
may or may not be named

49:23.161 --> 49:25.027
Athletic Director at TCU.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.690
-- Thank you. That's all.
-- Back here at 3:00.

49:27.765 --> 49:29.028
All right.

49:29.100 --> 49:31.899
<i>This doesn't originate
at the network level.</i>

49:31.969 --> 49:33.767
-- This is an FCC regulation.
-- Huh.

49:33.838 --> 49:34.930
Excuse me.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.167
Hey, Jeremy.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.299
I wasn't sure.
When you said, "after lunch,"

49:38.376 --> 49:40.572
is that after I eat lunch
or after you eat lunch?

49:40.645 --> 49:42.340
-- What time do you eat lunch?
-- Anytime you want.

49:42.413 --> 49:43.505
Let's do this now.

49:43.581 --> 49:46.278
You worked for Mark Sabath
over at USA Today.

49:47.185 --> 49:48.380
-- Yes.
-- [Door opens]

49:48.452 --> 49:49.783
<i>He's a friend of mine.</i>

49:49.854 --> 49:51.083
He used to mention that.

49:51.155 --> 49:53.522
We think you're doing
real well here, Jeremy,

49:53.591 --> 49:56.060
and we'd like you to get some
segment-producing expefience.

49:56.127 --> 49:57.595
Natalie,
I'm in Isaac's office.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.528
Would you bring me
the material for Jeremy?

49:59.597 --> 50:03.864
Um, thoroughbred racing,
golf chat, beach volleyball.

50:03.935 --> 50:05.801
It's not a prestige
assignment.

50:05.870 --> 50:08.464
It just lets us take a look
at what you can do.

50:08.539 --> 50:10.268
<i>We're sending you out
this week to put together</i>

50:10.341 --> 50:13.276
two seven-minute segments
for the CSC "Outdoorsman."

50:13.344 --> 50:14.812
The hunting show?

50:14.879 --> 50:16.438
Camping, fishing, hiking.

50:16.514 --> 50:17.845
And hunting --
I mean, there's hunting

50:17.915 --> 50:19.610
along with the camping,
the fishing, and the hiking.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.243
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- <i>Is that</i> a <i>problem?</i>

50:21.319 --> 50:22.377
The hunting?

50:22.453 --> 50:23.716
Yes.

50:23.788 --> 50:25.313
No, sir.

50:25.389 --> 50:26.550
-- Good.
-- <i>No problem.</i>

50:26.624 --> 50:28.058
-- Good.
-- <i>It's just</i> --

50:28.125 --> 50:30.321
I don't know anything about hunting.
I've never hunted.

50:30.394 --> 50:33.261
I've got a deli on the corner,
and they deliver 24 hours, so...

50:33.331 --> 50:34.264
Natalie.

50:34.332 --> 50:37.393
This is some briefing material
we put together for you.

50:37.468 --> 50:39.766
You should take it home and
study it the rest of the day.

50:39.837 --> 50:41.236
Tomorrow morning,
you'll take a van

50:41.305 --> 50:43.501
with your crew
up to the Adirondacks,

50:43.574 --> 50:46.271
where you'll meet Bob Shoemaker,
the professional guide,

50:46.344 --> 50:49.245
and Ed Bruckner from the Cincinnati
Reds, the guest celebrity.

50:49.313 --> 50:52.078
Wednesday, you're gonna go after
New England blue mallard.

50:52.149 --> 50:53.776
Thursday,
you're going after deer.

50:53.851 --> 50:56.650
Deer get very big in the
Adirondacks, so please be careful.

50:56.721 --> 50:59.452
Friday, you come home
and cut your segments together.

50:59.523 --> 51:00.991
All that information
is in here,

51:01.058 --> 51:02.822
plus all your contacts
at the show.

51:02.894 --> 51:03.759
Any questions?

51:03.828 --> 51:05.592
Am I being punished
'cause I guessed right

51:05.663 --> 51:07.290
on that play
in the Florida State game?

51:07.365 --> 51:08.457
-- <i>Jeremy...</i>
-- <i>Mr. Jaffee, it was</i> a <i>guess.</i>

51:08.532 --> 51:10.523
You asked me to guess,
so I guessed.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.467
-- What's he talking about?
-- A lucky guess.

51:12.536 --> 51:14.971
-- That's right.
-- Ooh, I'm <i>late</i> for a lunch.

51:15.039 --> 51:17.872
Jeremy, you're gonna do fine. I'll
see you at the end of the week.

51:17.942 --> 51:19.774
-- We've got a camera meeting
in the studio. -- Ah.

51:19.844 --> 51:22.643
I'll see you Friday.
Knock our socks off.

51:24.415 --> 51:27.214
-- He talked to Mark Sabath.
-- Isaac?

51:27.285 --> 51:29.481
Yeah, he talked to Mark Sabath.
He's my old boss.

51:29.553 --> 51:31.180
Isaac and Mark Sabath
go way back.

51:31.255 --> 51:32.882
Yeah, I know.

51:33.524 --> 51:36.619
-- Listen, I brought you some
snacks for the ride up. -- Really?

51:36.694 --> 51:38.890
It's nothing -- candy and stuff
I got from the machine.

51:38.963 --> 51:39.896
Twinkies.

51:39.964 --> 51:40.954
Thanks a lot.

51:41.032 --> 51:42.557
Don't be so nervous, Jeremy.

51:42.633 --> 51:46.035
Enjoy it.
You're getting the call.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.265
I still don't know
what that means!

51:56.914 --> 51:59.440
-- What are you doing?
-- Reading the paper.

51:59.517 --> 52:00.882
-- Why aren't you changed?
-- Into what?

52:00.952 --> 52:02.215
Your tuxedo.

52:03.788 --> 52:05.085
Today is Thursday.

52:05.156 --> 52:06.021
Yes.

52:06.090 --> 52:07.319
Today is next Thursday.

52:07.391 --> 52:09.917
It's this Thursday.
This is next Thursday.

52:09.994 --> 52:11.189
-- I'll go change.
-- Wait.

52:11.262 --> 52:12.787
-- There are two cars downstairs.
-- Good.

52:12.863 --> 52:14.558
-- I want you to ride with Isaac.
-- Fine.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.726
I want you to ride with Isaac
so that Casey rides with Dana.

52:16.801 --> 52:19.065
-- That's fine. -- I want
Casey to ride with Dana.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.570
I get it.

52:20.638 --> 52:21.730
Do you?

52:21.806 --> 52:24.400
I ride with Isaac, and Casey
and Dana fall in love.

52:24.475 --> 52:25.442
Right.

52:25.509 --> 52:27.102
Wow, is that
a stupid plan.

52:27.178 --> 52:28.668
Go change.

52:29.847 --> 52:31.645
-- Ow.
-- Well, hold still!

52:31.716 --> 52:33.115
You're stabbing me
in the chest.

52:33.184 --> 52:35.278
I'm stabbing you in the chest
because you're squirming.

52:35.353 --> 52:37.117
I'm really pretty sure
it's the other way around.

52:37.188 --> 52:39.054
-- <i>Casey?</i>
-- Yeah?

52:39.123 --> 52:41.854
-- I've been thinking a lot
about soccer lately. -- And?

52:41.926 --> 52:44.088
Pretty much through with that.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.185
Yeah?

52:45.262 --> 52:48.288
You know, to save my life, I couldn't
name five teams that play in the MLS.

52:48.366 --> 52:49.424
I know there's Luxembourg.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.935
The MLS is an American
soccer league.

52:52.003 --> 52:54.665
-- Luxembourg doesn't play
in this league? -- No.

52:54.739 --> 52:56.605
So I don't even know
Luxembourg.

52:56.674 --> 52:57.732
Ow again.

52:57.808 --> 53:01.073
You know, this is what you get for being
a grown man who can't dress himself.

53:01.145 --> 53:02.806
I used to have a wife
for that.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.473
Tell you what else -- I'm
starting to get a little cheesed

53:04.548 --> 53:06.812
at people telling me
the reason I don't like soccer

53:06.884 --> 53:08.249
is that I don't understand it.

53:08.319 --> 53:11.016
I think I do understand it. I
think I understand it just fine.

53:11.088 --> 53:13.113
I just happen to think
it's a mind-numbing bore

53:13.190 --> 53:14.555
and that any reasonable person

53:14.625 --> 53:16.525
would rather be playing it
than watching it.

53:16.594 --> 53:18.790
Well, I know it doesn't match
the pulse-pounding excitement

53:18.863 --> 53:20.262
of a good sailboat race.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.959
Wait till you see Dana.
She looks amazing.

53:23.034 --> 53:24.502
<i>All right, nobody move.</i>

53:24.568 --> 53:26.730
Name five teams
that play in the MLS,

53:26.804 --> 53:28.636
and Casey says
it's an American soccer league,

53:28.706 --> 53:30.401
so you can't choose
Luxembourg. Go.

53:30.474 --> 53:32.499
-- Columbus Crew. -- Miami Fusion.
-- New England Revolution.

53:32.576 --> 53:34.010
-- Tampa Bay Mutiny.
-- D.C. United.

53:34.078 --> 53:35.603
-- <i>Chicago Fire.</i>
-- <i>Colorado Rapids.</i>

53:35.679 --> 53:37.169
-- Dallas <i>Burn.</i>
-- <i>Kansas City Wizards.</i>

53:37.248 --> 53:38.181
Los Angeles Galaxy.

53:38.249 --> 53:41.275
And the New York/New Jersey
Metrostars.

53:44.588 --> 53:46.750
You all just made that up,
didn't you?

53:48.759 --> 53:50.227
-- You got smoked.
-- Yeah.

53:50.294 --> 53:52.285
The cars are waiting
downstairs,

53:52.363 --> 53:53.626
right, Dan, the cars?

53:53.697 --> 53:55.096
Yeah, yeah.

53:56.167 --> 53:58.135
-- Say, about these cars.
-- What about them?

53:58.202 --> 54:00.398
-- There are two of them.
-- There are four of us.

54:00.471 --> 54:02.838
I was just thinking I could
ride with Isaac, if you like.

54:02.907 --> 54:04.773
-- Why?
-- So you could ride with Dana.

54:04.842 --> 54:08.301
-- Why would I want to ride with Dana? --
Why wouldn't you want <i>to ride</i> with Dana?

54:08.379 --> 54:10.541
-- There's no reason I wouldn't
want to ride with Dana. -- You <i>see?</i>

54:10.614 --> 54:12.582
<i>I'm just asking
why in particular you asked me</i>

54:12.650 --> 54:14.482
specifically if I wanted
to ride with Dana.

54:14.552 --> 54:16.953
-- You don't want to ride with Dana? --
No, I'm -- Vm <i>happy to ride</i> with Dana.

54:17.021 --> 54:18.716
But I'm also happy to ride
with you or with Isaac.

54:18.789 --> 54:21.656
-- <i>Good.</i> -- <i>What's more important
is why did you ask me?</i>

54:21.725 --> 54:23.955
-- Why did I ask you what? --
<i>If I</i> wanted <i>to ride</i> with Dana.

54:24.028 --> 54:26.190
I got to tell you,
at this point,

54:26.263 --> 54:29.392
the length of this conversation is way
out of proportion to my interest in it.

54:29.467 --> 54:31.458
-- VVell, all right, then let's
just leave it at that. -- Fine.

54:32.636 --> 54:34.570
Except to say this --
You know, I just finished

54:34.638 --> 54:37.369
an hour-long broadcast
at the end of a 14-hour day,

54:37.441 --> 54:38.909
and I'm not in the mood
to go to a party,

54:38.976 --> 54:40.410
not in the mood
to have my picture taken,

54:40.478 --> 54:42.469
and I'm not in the mood
to notice Dana's dress

54:42.546 --> 54:44.514
or notice Dana's hair
or notice Dana's shoes.

54:44.582 --> 54:48.041
Dana's not my date, she's my
producer, and the w0rkday's over.

54:49.086 --> 54:51.646
I'm not in the mood
to notice anything tonight.

54:53.924 --> 54:55.756
I forgot my purse.

55:01.232 --> 55:03.997
On your feet, partner.
Let's go.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.567
Oh, Danny,
where's Isaac?

55:11.642 --> 55:12.632
Control room.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.045
Isaac...

55:17.114 --> 55:19.446
Bob Shoemakefis calling
from the Adirondacks.

55:19.517 --> 55:21.645
Something happened
with Jeremy.

55:21.719 --> 55:23.813
Isaac Jaffee.
What's going on?

55:28.125 --> 55:31.652
<i>Chris: Studio this is master control.
You're up on router 21.</i>

55:31.729 --> 55:32.355
<i>Dave: Thank you.</i>

55:32.429 --> 55:35.490
Five minutes to air. Natalie, find
out why Dan isn't in the studio.

55:35.566 --> 55:37.898
Chicago says
their sound level's low.

55:37.968 --> 55:40.027
Uh, let me hear them.
Talk to me, Chicago.

55:40.104 --> 55:41.128
They are talking
to you, Dana.

55:41.205 --> 55:42.730
-- They're talking to me now?
-- Yes.

55:42.806 --> 55:43.864
I can't hear them.

55:43.941 --> 55:45.340
-- Switch them to 4.
-- We're on 4.

55:45.409 --> 55:47.343
-- I can't hear Chicago.
-- <i>We'll fix</i> it.

55:47.411 --> 55:48.674
<i>You have four minutes.</i>

55:51.048 --> 55:52.573
Why aren't you
in the studio?

55:52.650 --> 55:54.982
-- I'm trying to avoid Casey.
-- Why?

55:55.052 --> 55:56.247
He's making me crazy.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.913
He's been making me crazy
all day.

55:57.988 --> 55:59.353
It doesn't work for me.

55:59.423 --> 56:01.721
I'm more comfortable
when I'm making him crazy.

56:01.792 --> 56:02.953
Why is he making you crazy?

56:03.027 --> 56:05.223
Well, it seems he met
a girl last night.

56:05.296 --> 56:06.092
Who?

56:06.163 --> 56:07.756
-- Who do you think?
-- Dana?

56:07.831 --> 56:09.196
-- Yes.
-- It was the dress!

56:09.266 --> 56:10.859
'Cause you made me play
musical cars.

56:10.935 --> 56:12.198
It was the dress
and the cars.

56:12.269 --> 56:14.567
In combination with a number of
things, not the least of which

56:14.638 --> 56:17.335
is that she was spending time
with another guy at the party.

56:17.408 --> 56:18.842
Now we're in business.

56:18.909 --> 56:20.638
Boy, I'd love to be
out of the loop

56:20.711 --> 56:22.907
on the next piece of drama
that's gonna happen around here.

56:22.980 --> 56:25.005
<i>Dana: Dan, we need you
in the studio, please.</i>

56:25.082 --> 56:26.811
But I don't think
that's gonna happen.

56:29.453 --> 56:31.285
We've got Chicago.

56:31.355 --> 56:33.949
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Let me hear the studio.

56:34.024 --> 56:36.288
-- Which studio?
-- Our <i>studio!</i>

56:36.360 --> 56:38.385
-- Not hearing them now?
-- I'm not hearing them now.

56:38.462 --> 56:39.452
That's a problem.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.123
<i>Yes, that's a problem.</i>

56:41.198 --> 56:43.963
If I can't hear the show,
I can't produce the show.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.559
They taught me that
in producing school.

56:45.636 --> 56:47.434
You got 90 seconds.

56:48.172 --> 56:49.901
-- 4-3 defense.
-- Thank you.

56:49.974 --> 56:53.137
Hey...let me ask you
a quick question.

56:53.210 --> 56:55.941
-- You know, right now might not be
the best time. -- This is important.

56:56.013 --> 56:59.278
-- What's the question? -- How many
people can you think of named Gordon?

56:59.350 --> 57:01.842
-- How many people can I think
of named Gordon? -- Yeah.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.581
-- <i>Two.</i> -- <i>That's how many I got.
Which were your two?</i>

57:04.655 --> 57:06.020
Gordon Lightfoot
and Gordon Liddy.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.354
Those are my two. Those are the
exact same two that I got.

57:08.425 --> 57:09.688
Can you think of any more?

57:09.760 --> 57:12.491
<i>We're live in 60 seconds.
Roll VTR.</i>

57:12.563 --> 57:14.588
-- <i>Can somebody help me, please?</i>
-- <i>They can't hear you in there.</i>

57:14.665 --> 57:15.996
-- <i>Can you think of any more?</i>
-- No.

57:16.066 --> 57:17.625
-- Neither can I.
-- Good.

57:17.701 --> 57:20.033
And it's my feeling that if
those are the only two you got

57:20.104 --> 57:21.071
and those are
the only two I got,

57:21.138 --> 57:23.266
those should be
the only two there are.

57:23.340 --> 57:25.274
-- Granting the premise.
-- And you should.

57:25.342 --> 57:26.810
-- You should grant the premise, Danny.
-- <i>I</i> do.

57:26.877 --> 57:27.810
<i>Chris: 30 seconds.</i>

57:27.878 --> 57:29.937
'Cause we're two pretty well-educated
people, and we both thought about it,

57:30.014 --> 57:31.778
and we both came up
with only two Gordons.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.817
-- <i>I'm granting the damn premise.</i>
-- <i>You should.</i>

57:33.884 --> 57:36.615
-- <i>Casey, you're driving me</i> --
-- <i>My point is, here we are.</i>

57:36.687 --> 57:38.416
We're going along in life,
and everything's fine.

57:38.489 --> 57:40.890
As far as we know, there are
only two Gordons out there,

57:40.958 --> 57:43.791
when all of a sudden,
a third one comes along.

57:43.861 --> 57:46.660
-- The guy talking to Dana at the thing
last night. -- The guy talking to Dana.

57:46.730 --> 57:49.700
The guy out there
talking to Dana -- Gordon.

57:49.767 --> 57:52.134
-- <i>We've got sound.</i>
-- <i>Oh, thank God.</i>

57:52.202 --> 57:54.534
-- That was all I had to say.
-- Thank merciful God.

57:54.605 --> 57:56.539
In 3...2...1.

57:56.607 --> 57:58.507
Good evening.
From New York City,

57:58.575 --> 58:00.839
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

58:00.911 --> 58:02.902
Those stories, plus
grab your galoshes.

58:02.980 --> 58:05.039
We're gonna take you
out to the lditarod.

58:05.115 --> 58:08.210
Why? 'Cause we just can't
believe it ourselves.

58:08.285 --> 58:09.753
<i>Also, grab your notebooks.</i>

58:09.820 --> 58:11.652
We're gonna take you inside
the 4-3 defense

58:11.722 --> 58:13.816
on this week's edition
of "Inside the 4-3 Defense."

58:13.891 --> 58:15.586
All that
coming up after this.

58:15.659 --> 58:18.685
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

58:18.762 --> 58:22.221
-- <i>And we're out.</i> Back <i>in 60.</i>
-- <i>Dave, Chris, Will,</i>

58:22.299 --> 58:23.323
what are you guys doing
tomorrow morning at 10:00?

58:23.400 --> 58:26.426
-- Got a basketball game at the -- Yeah,
it's a 3-on-3 with the guys from --

58:26.503 --> 58:29.996
-- Dave, Chris, Will, what are you guys doing tomorrow
morning at 10:00? -- Fixing the sound system?

58:30.074 --> 58:31.064
There you go.

58:32.209 --> 58:35.235
Camera,
your wrap is 12:06.

58:35.312 --> 58:38.043
Let's not get into
golden time.

58:38.115 --> 58:39.480
One more question.

58:39.550 --> 58:42.144
Can I get a Teamster to hit Casey
in the head with something heavy?

58:42.219 --> 58:44.381
Look, how did you know
the guy's name was Gordon?

58:44.455 --> 58:45.581
We were introduced.

58:45.656 --> 58:46.817
-- At the reception?
-- Yes.

58:46.890 --> 58:48.654
-- By Dana?
-- Yes.

58:48.726 --> 58:50.285
“Interesting.
-- Not really.

58:50.361 --> 58:52.693
-- You think they were on a date?
-- Yes.

58:52.763 --> 58:55.061
-- You think they were on a date?
-- Yes.

58:55.132 --> 58:56.827
I totally disagree.

58:56.900 --> 58:58.299
She introduced you to him.
Big deal.

58:58.369 --> 59:00.531
It's not like she walked up
to you and said,

59:00.604 --> 59:02.231
"Dan, this is my date,
Gordon."

59:02.306 --> 59:03.933
I want to know
exactly what she said

59:04.007 --> 59:05.441
when she introduced you
to him.

59:05.509 --> 59:08.945
She said, "Dan,
this is my date, Gordon."

59:10.347 --> 59:12.679
All right, we're cranking
this whole thing up a notch.

59:21.458 --> 59:24.189
[Telephone rings]

59:24.261 --> 59:26.127
<i>Natalie." You're back!</i>

59:26.196 --> 59:27.493
<i>-- Yes.
-- Yaw.!</i>

59:29.166 --> 59:31.225
-- Really? -- Good. Cut
together pretty well.

59:31.301 --> 59:32.700
We saw the rough cut
a few hours ago.

59:32.770 --> 59:34.238
-- We thought it looked great.
-- Really.

59:34.304 --> 59:35.635
-- Thank you.
-- When you get a final cut,

59:35.706 --> 59:37.333
we'll send it to your parents
in a nice package.

59:37.408 --> 59:39.103
It's your first on-screen credit.
They'll flip.

59:39.176 --> 59:40.371
They'll like it.

59:40.444 --> 59:42.242
-- VVelcome back. -- Hey!
-- Hey, how'd it go?

59:42.312 --> 59:42.972
Oh, real good.

59:43.046 --> 59:45.640
<i>Jeremy, can we see you
in my office for a moment?</i>

59:45.716 --> 59:48.208
-- Yeah, sure. What's up?
-- My office.

59:49.686 --> 59:52.678
I was wondering
why you were lying just now.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.952
-- What do you mean? -- Jeremy, did
you think we weren't gonna find out?

59:55.025 --> 59:56.618
What the hell happened
out there?

59:56.693 --> 59:58.058
-- It was nothing.
-- It was not nothing.

59:58.128 --> 59:59.289
I got sick.
I threw up.

59:59.363 --> 01:00:01.627
They took you to the hospital.
You passed out.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:04.633
-- I told them -- -- Bob Shoemaker <i>said</i>
you were sweating and hyperventffatfng.

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:05.691
It was hot outside.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:07.498
Not in the Adirondacks
in October.

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:09.198
-- Look -- -- Tell us
about your hunting trip.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.935
The first day, you were going
after New England blue mallard.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:14.877
Yeah.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:18.711
Bob and Eddie were using
the l.R. 50 Recon by Bushcomber.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.841
It's got a 16-inch
microgroove barrel

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:23.546
with .30-30 mags,
side-scope mount,

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.055
wire-cutter sheath,
quick-release bolt,

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.353
mag catches,
and a 3-pound trigger,

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:30.655
so I figured
we must be going after

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:32.161
a pretty dangerous duck.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:33.924
You can wiseass
all you want.

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:35.556
You're gonna tell me
what happened.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.157
We shot a deer...

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:43.001
...in the woods near Lake
Mattatuck on the second day.

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.666
There was a special vest

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.573
they had me wear so that
they could distinguish me

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.236
from things
they wanted to shoot,

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.679
and I was pretty grateful
for that.

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.511
Almost the whole day
had gone by,

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.244
and we hadn't gotten anything.

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:55.513
Eddie was getting frustrated,

01:00:55.586 --> 01:00:57.384
and Bob Shoemaker
was getting embarrassed.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:58.922
My camera guy
needed to reload,

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:02.254
so I told everybody
to take a 10-minute break.

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:03.885
There was a stream nearby,
and I walked over

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:07.522
with this care package
Natalie made me, sat down.

01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:10.226
When I looked up,
I saw three of them --

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.359
small, bigger, biggest --

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:15.064
<i>recognizable to any species
on the face of the planet</i>

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.334
as a child, a mother,
and a father.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:18.636
Now, the trick
in shooting deer

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.700
is you got to get them
out in the open,

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.938
and it's tough with deer

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.946
'cause these are
clever, cagey animals

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.778
with an intuitive sense
of danger.

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:28.750
You know what you have to do
to get a deer out in the open?

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:32.255
You hold out a Twinkie.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.384
That animal clopped up to me
like we were at a party.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.952
She seemed to be pretty
interested in the Twinkie,

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:40.292
so I gave it to her.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.093
Looking back,
she'd have been better off

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.429
if I'd given her
the damn vest.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:47.402
<i>And Bob kind of screamed at me
and whispered, "Move away!"</i>

01:01:47.471 --> 01:01:49.906
<i>The camera had been reloaded,
and it looked like the day</i>

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:52.305
<i>wasn't gonna be a washout
after all.</i>

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.804
Sol backed away...

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.814
a couple of steps
at a time...

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.874
and I closed my eyes
when I heard the shot.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.585
Look, I know
these are animals,

01:02:04.655 --> 01:02:07.590
and they don't play bridge
and go to the prom,

01:02:07.658 --> 01:02:10.753
but you can't tell me that the little
one didn't know who his mother was.

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.789
That's got to mean
something.

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:18.062
<i>And later at the hospital,</i>

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:21.070
Bob Shoemaker was telling me about the
nobility and tradition of hunting

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.106
and how it related to
the Native American Indians,

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:25.369
and I nodded, and I said
that was interesting,

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:28.605
while I was thinking about
what a load of crap it was.

01:02:28.679 --> 01:02:30.670
Hunting was part of
Indian culture.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.409
It was food and it was clothes
and it was shelter.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.952
They sang and danced
and offered prayers to the gods

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:38.113
for a successful hunt
so that they could survive

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:40.680
just one more unimaginably
brutal winter.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.020
The things they had to kill

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:44.220
held the highest place
of respect for them,

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:46.023
and to kill for fun was a sin.

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:49.157
And they knew the gods

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.530
wouldn't be so generous
next time.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:54.594
What we did wasn't food,
and it wasn't shelter,

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:56.901
and it sure wasn't sports!

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.806
It was just mean.

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.212
Jeremy...

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:13.245
...why didn't you tell us
how you felt about hunting

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:14.620
when we gave you this?

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:17.422
-- Because you told me you spoke to Mark
Sabath at USA Today. -- Yeah, but --

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:20.691
In fact, I know you must've spoken
to him before you ever hired me.

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:22.027
Well, of course I did.

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:24.761
<i>I also spoke to Dave Heller</i>
at <i>the Free Press</i>

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:27.133
and Tom Monahan
at the Sacramento <i>Bee.</i>

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:28.899
And they all said pretty much
the same thing?

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.907
Yes, they all said that Jeremy
Goodwin was a bright guy

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:34.410
with a world-class understanding
of popular sports,

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.003
but that he didn't
quite fit in,

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:39.174
and there was little chance that
he'd advance in their organization.

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:40.717
All due respect,
Mr. Jaffee,

01:03:40.784 --> 01:03:43.116
but I have $80,000
in college loans to pay back.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:46.315
My instincts told me to shut the
hell up and do what I was told.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.482
Your instincts were wrong.

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:50.026
Not fitting in is how
qualified people lose jobs.

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:52.084
Yeah,
but a lot of the time,

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.597
it's how they end up
working here.

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:59.297
Now, you had an obligation
to tell us how you felt,

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.202
partly because I don't like
getting a phone call

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:04.366
saying I put one of my people
in the hospital...

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.912
...but mostly because if you feel
that strongly about something,

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:12.938
you have a responsibility
to try and change my mind!

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:16.352
<i>Did you think
I would fire you</i>

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.446
simply because you made
a convincing argument?

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.585
It's taken me a lot of years,
but I've come around to this --

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:26.493
if you're dumb, surround
yourself with smart people,

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:28.122
and if you're smart,
surround yourself

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.099
with smart people
who disagree with you.

01:04:32.803 --> 01:04:35.272
I'm an awfully smart man,
and Mark Sabath is an idiot!

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:38.069
He had you, and he blew it.

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:43.272
You're gonna do
great here...

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.178
but you got to trust us.

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.616
You fit in
on your own time.

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.087
When you come to work
for <i>me,</i>

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:53.782
you show up to play_

01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:57.122
I'm going home.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.263
You don't know us
very well,

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:09.465
so if it's hard trusting us
at the beginning...

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:12.600
maybe it'll help
to know that...

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.339
...we trust you.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.781
Good night.

01:05:22.853 --> 01:05:24.685
[Door opens]

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:27.615
[Door closes]

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:33.419

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:34.862

-- <i>Fl</i> You <i>be my</i> mother <i>fl</i>

I got the call.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.128
