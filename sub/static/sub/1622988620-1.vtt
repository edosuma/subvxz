00:24.883 --> 00:28.390
Good afternoon,
Walsh High School.

00:28.425 --> 00:30.887
It is that time
of the year again.

00:30.922 --> 00:33.725
Seniors, don't forget to
clean out your lockers

00:33.760 --> 00:35.595
by the end of the day.

00:35.630 --> 00:39.335
Note, we will not hold
onto your things for you.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.832
We will see everyone else
next year.

00:41.867 --> 00:45.110
Don't forget to have
a great summer.

00:56.915 --> 01:00.785
- Man, I can't wait
to just do nothing.

01:02.624 --> 01:04.624
- Look, Dave,
I'm not saying

01:04.659 --> 01:06.230
it's your worst effort ever,

01:06.265 --> 01:08.397
but it certainly leaves
a lot to be desired.

01:08.432 --> 01:10.058
It'd be so simple to just, say,

01:10.093 --> 01:11.961
have the correct number
of electrons?

01:11.996 --> 01:13.270
I mean, you're only missing one.

01:13.305 --> 01:15.569
- Yeah, yeah.
Whatever, electrons. Okay.

01:15.604 --> 01:18.572
Look, I'm telling you
it's all about the presentation!

01:18.607 --> 01:20.145
Maybe if you get
this model spinning,

01:20.180 --> 01:22.774
no one will care about
how many electrons it's got.

01:22.809 --> 01:25.447
Look, I'm thinking like hook up
a motor rig on the bottom

01:25.482 --> 01:26.910
so it does the spin. Yeah?

01:26.945 --> 01:27.779
- Oh. Yeah. And you're going
to do all of that

01:27.814 --> 01:29.550
in the next five minutes?

01:29.585 --> 01:30.947
- Five minutes?

01:30.982 --> 01:32.289
It was five minutes
five minutes ago!

01:32.324 --> 01:33.488
- It's really a quick fix.

01:33.523 --> 01:34.456
You just need
one more electron--

01:34.491 --> 01:35.952
- Don't--don't listen to her.

01:35.987 --> 01:37.591
Look, you get this thing
in motion

01:37.626 --> 01:40.462
and Johnson will let you
teach the class next year.

01:40.497 --> 01:43.399
- Nah, I think it's done.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.249
- Yeah. I mean,
you're right, dude.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.185
You don't need that kind of
responsibility anyway.

02:12.991 --> 02:14.089
- I wonder when
they're gonna release

02:14.124 --> 02:15.761
the summer reading list
for the fall.

02:15.796 --> 02:17.664
I've heard that sophomore
year's much more rigorous,

02:17.699 --> 02:18.995
academically.

02:19.998 --> 02:21.338
- Yow, Curtis!

02:21.373 --> 02:23.703
I hear you can make it
so I can get an "A" in Algebra.

02:23.738 --> 02:25.375
- That might be true.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.871
But it's not gonna be
for free though.

02:26.906 --> 02:28.840
I'm thinking 30 bucks.

02:28.875 --> 02:31.007
Hey, man, you know,
you really want that "A".

02:31.042 --> 02:32.107
- Yeah.

02:32.142 --> 02:34.516
- Perfect. All right,
you got it, dude.

02:34.551 --> 02:37.145
- Ah, Curtis,
how're you gonna make it

02:37.180 --> 02:38.388
so he gets an "A" in Algebra?

02:38.423 --> 02:39.884
- Ah, I am not.

02:39.919 --> 02:41.325
- But you just said--

02:41.360 --> 02:43.393
- I said it might be true.
And who knows?

02:43.428 --> 02:45.791
Maybe tomorrow it will be.
But probably not.

02:45.826 --> 02:46.957
- So, what's gonna happen

02:46.992 --> 02:48.024
when he realizes
he's not getting an "A"?

02:48.059 --> 02:49.366
Freshman!
- Whoo.

02:49.401 --> 02:50.301
- Where's the "A"
you promised me?

02:50.336 --> 02:51.632
- Whoa, buddy! Look

02:51.667 --> 02:52.864
I--I can totally see
how you misunderstood,

02:52.899 --> 02:54.833
but what I actually said was,
it might be true.

02:54.868 --> 02:55.834
- Hey!

02:55.869 --> 02:56.901
- Okay.

02:59.741 --> 03:01.070
- Stupid freshmen.

03:01.105 --> 03:02.709
- That wasn't

03:02.744 --> 03:04.909
Man, somebody should do
something about that guy.

03:04.944 --> 03:06.218
- Ugh.

03:12.457 --> 03:14.919
Uhm, thanks for sticking up
for me back there.

03:14.954 --> 03:16.954
- I thought you handled yourself
quite well.

03:18.595 --> 03:20.562
- Man, the seniors
have got it made.

03:20.597 --> 03:21.728
Done with school.

03:21.763 --> 03:23.235
Basically, just
endless summer vacation

03:23.270 --> 03:24.929
for the rest of their lives.

03:24.964 --> 03:26.568
- What?
Dude, are you kidding me?

03:26.603 --> 03:27.932
They're screwed.

03:27.967 --> 03:29.934
They wish they still had
three years left of summer.

03:29.969 --> 03:31.738
- Yeah. I find that
hard to believe.

03:31.773 --> 03:33.839
- Well, don't take
my word for it.

03:33.874 --> 03:34.939
Follow me.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.079
Summer jobs!

03:44.654 --> 03:47.787
The number one killer
of summer fun.

03:47.822 --> 03:50.119
And the ultimate price
to be paid

03:50.154 --> 03:51.626
for being in your late teens.

03:51.661 --> 03:53.859
- But aren't we entering
our late teens?

03:53.894 --> 03:56.026
- Yeah. I mean,
15 is mid-teens.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.798
You know, 15 is the year
of the optional summer job.

03:58.833 --> 04:00.866
Once you hit 16,
that's when they make you

04:00.901 --> 04:02.131
start earning money.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.100
- Well, earning money
does have the upside of

04:04.135 --> 04:05.574
the money.

04:05.609 --> 04:06.971
I think I definitely
I want to earn money someday.

04:07.006 --> 04:10.414
- I'd literally pay money
not to have to earn money.

04:10.449 --> 04:11.910
- And we get by okay!

04:11.945 --> 04:14.176
And we rock a thrift store
like no one else.

04:15.817 --> 04:17.080
Hey, what's up, wiener?

04:22.527 --> 04:23.988
- You know,
you realize next summer,

04:24.023 --> 04:25.330
we'll be 16?

04:25.365 --> 04:26.925
- Yeah.
And we'll be the wieners.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.663
- Well, yeah.
But that's next summer.

04:28.698 --> 04:30.467
That's why it's so important
that this summer

04:30.502 --> 04:32.062
be something truly special!

04:32.097 --> 04:32.997
- What do you have in mind?

04:35.166 --> 04:36.935
- Whatever we want!

04:36.970 --> 04:39.740
You know, that's the whole point
of freedom.

04:39.775 --> 04:43.579
While those poor sops are
out there scooping up dog crap,

04:43.614 --> 04:45.482
we'll be having adventures.

04:45.517 --> 04:48.353
- Well, are you thinking
of any specific adventures?

04:48.388 --> 04:49.816
- Anything we can imagine!

04:49.851 --> 04:51.279
You know, think big!

04:51.314 --> 04:53.820
- Well, I think we should have
a brainstorming session.

04:53.855 --> 04:54.986
You know,
narrow down our ideas

04:55.021 --> 04:57.021
based on feasibility
and general interest,

04:57.056 --> 05:00.431
and then we can start talking
logistics and execution.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.191
- Yeah. Lotta big words
in that sentence,

05:02.226 --> 05:03.962
but I'm looking
for some big ideas.

05:03.997 --> 05:05.931
- Well, we're going to
need to plan our pool days

05:05.966 --> 05:07.933
around the Fourth of July
to avoid crowds,

05:07.968 --> 05:09.033
and any long-distance adventures

05:09.068 --> 05:11.200
will require transport
other than bikes.

05:11.235 --> 05:12.773
And those will require
permission.

05:12.808 --> 05:15.039
- Come on, Hannah, pool? Really?

05:15.074 --> 05:17.382
Think big.
Think the moon!

05:17.417 --> 05:20.110
- Or we could just hang out.

05:20.145 --> 05:23.113
I mean, we've got video games,
and food and drink,

05:23.148 --> 05:25.181
knick-knacks.

05:25.216 --> 05:26.985
We could hit up
a garage sale or two.

05:27.020 --> 05:29.053
Just chill.

05:29.088 --> 05:31.121
- But, Dave,
we do that every weekend.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.530
- Yeah, come on,
last summer ever, remember?

05:33.565 --> 05:34.960
Like think big!

05:34.995 --> 05:35.961
- I don't know.
All that big thinkin'

05:35.996 --> 05:38.128
sounds kind of exhausting.

05:38.163 --> 05:43.166
I mean, planning around things,
and permission, feasibility

05:44.268 --> 05:48.006
- Yeah. No.
Move over.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.579
I don't know
what I was thinking.

05:49.614 --> 05:51.878
- What?
So, no brainstorming session?

05:51.913 --> 05:54.848
- Hannah, you are welcome
to brainstorm all you want,

05:54.883 --> 05:58.885
but you also have the high score
and as per clubhouse rules,

05:58.920 --> 06:02.427
that allows us to challenge
the reigning champ at any time.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.055
- I challenge the champ.

06:05.795 --> 06:07.894
- Hannah? Hannah?

06:07.929 --> 06:10.094
- Come on.
- Hannah.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.067
- Fine.

06:16.102 --> 06:18.443
I'm so excited to do nothing
with you guys this summer.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.906
- Yes, there we go.

06:19.941 --> 06:21.105
Mission to launch.

06:21.140 --> 06:24.416
In three, two, one.

06:26.717 --> 06:28.079
- Hey, guys,
uh, I'm gonna head out.

06:28.114 --> 06:29.278
I'm gonna meet up
with Curtis and Hannah.

06:29.313 --> 06:30.521
I think I'll be going--

06:30.556 --> 06:33.282
- No, no, no, no!
Sit, buster.

06:33.317 --> 06:35.053
We're gonna start having
dinners together

06:35.088 --> 06:36.890
as a family this summer. Sit!

06:40.390 --> 06:43.633
- So, how are you
and your friends

06:43.668 --> 06:45.965
planning on spending the summer?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.297
- Uh, I don't know.
Uh, play some video games.

06:48.332 --> 06:50.805
Hang out.
Have fun, I guess.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.873
That's what
I thought you'd say.

06:52.908 --> 06:54.710
- Well, at least I'm consistent.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.976
That's my boy!

06:57.011 --> 06:58.208
Listen, what your mom's
trying to say--

06:58.243 --> 06:59.484
- What we're saying is that

06:59.519 --> 07:01.717
it's time for you
to get a summer job.

07:04.656 --> 07:06.117
- Very funny.

07:06.152 --> 07:08.284
- What's very funny?

07:08.319 --> 07:09.989
- I'm 15 years old.

07:11.828 --> 07:14.092
It's the year of
the optional summer job.

07:14.127 --> 07:15.764
- Says who?

07:15.799 --> 07:17.634
- I think
it's in the US Constitution.

07:17.669 --> 07:19.834
Could you pass
that salad dressing?

07:19.869 --> 07:21.836
- It's not in the Constitution.

07:21.871 --> 07:23.002
- It must be in the Bible, then.

07:23.037 --> 07:24.003
- It's not in the Bible either.

07:24.038 --> 07:25.807
- Have you read the whole Bible?

07:25.842 --> 07:28.579
- Dave, you're getting
a summer job.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.582
It's time you learn
the value of responsibility.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.749
Now, your father and I
are happy to help you find one,

07:33.784 --> 07:36.752
if you need us,
but wherever you work,

07:36.787 --> 07:39.282
I expect to see
a nice fat bank balance

07:39.317 --> 07:41.592
by the time
August rolls around.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.693
- Bank balance?

07:43.728 --> 07:44.925
You're serious?

07:44.960 --> 07:46.828
- Yeah.
That's the point of a job, son!

07:46.863 --> 07:48.599
I mean, take your mom
for instance, right.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.029
She built this business
from the ground up,

07:50.064 --> 07:53.934
and fully dedicated herself
to all the consulting,

07:53.969 --> 07:56.101
and advising,
and the promoting--

07:56.136 --> 08:00.105
- The point is to see
the fruits of your hard work.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.812
Advising local retailers
on the benefits and strategies

08:03.847 --> 08:05.440
of community engagement.

08:05.475 --> 08:08.344
- Right.
And that hard work pays off.

08:08.379 --> 08:09.521
Exactly. I know.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.347
Community
benefits advising

08:11.382 --> 08:13.118
Anyway, think of the happiness
your mom gets

08:13.153 --> 08:14.856
when she brings home
her hard-earned money

08:14.891 --> 08:16.154
and put a roof over your head

08:16.189 --> 08:18.156
and put all this food
on the table.

08:18.191 --> 08:20.829
That is payoff!

08:20.864 --> 08:22.490
So, at the end
of the summer,

08:22.525 --> 08:25.328
you'll have the experience
of using your own money

08:25.363 --> 08:27.671
to buy your
back-to-school supplies.

08:27.706 --> 08:28.837
We'll go together!

08:29.840 --> 08:31.642
- Back to school ?

08:31.677 --> 08:35.910
- Yep. And you know what?
I'm already proud of you, son.

08:37.111 --> 08:38.044
It's gonna be a good summer.

08:38.079 --> 08:39.078
Yeah.

08:42.886 --> 08:44.919
You guys are
never going to believe this.

08:44.954 --> 08:46.151
- They're making you
get a summer job.

08:46.186 --> 08:47.823
- My parents
are making me get

08:47.858 --> 08:48.989
how did you know that?

08:49.024 --> 08:50.089
- Because my parents
said the same thing.

08:50.124 --> 08:51.893
I have to get one too.

08:51.928 --> 08:54.599
- What happened to
"optional," Curtis?

08:54.634 --> 08:58.031
- It's cruel and unusual!
It's inhumane!

08:58.066 --> 08:59.901
I think it violates
the Geneva Convention!

08:59.936 --> 09:01.870
- Believe me,
I was up all night, checking.

09:01.905 --> 09:03.234
- Yeah. Curtis, I don't know
where you're getting

09:03.269 --> 09:05.940
your information from,
but it's clearly out of date.

09:05.975 --> 09:07.711
My parents said that
now that we're in high school,

09:07.746 --> 09:09.779
it's time to grow up
and take some responsibility.

09:09.814 --> 09:11.341
- My parents said
the same thing.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.683
What, are they
coordinating this?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.784
- No. That's it!
It's a conspiracy!

09:14.819 --> 09:16.852
It's collusion!
It's price-fixing.

09:16.887 --> 09:17.952
We'll take 'em to court!

09:17.987 --> 09:19.184
You guys didn't agree
to anything, right?

09:19.219 --> 09:20.449
- I couldn't even get a word in!

09:20.484 --> 09:23.122
- Good. Hannah?

09:23.157 --> 09:26.191
I I already have
three interviews scheduled.

09:26.226 --> 09:27.555
- What?
- I'm sorry.

09:27.590 --> 09:29.095
My parents said that I need to
take some risks!

09:29.130 --> 09:31.636
You know, chart my own path,
and make some money of my own.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.803
What's so great about money?

09:33.838 --> 09:36.465
We got all this great stuff
for pennies.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.807
Thrift shops, yard sales

09:37.842 --> 09:40.139
and it's worth so much
because of how we found it,

09:40.174 --> 09:42.075
not what we paid for it.

09:43.144 --> 09:45.716
- Wait, what'd your mom
say about money?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.916
- That at the end of the summer,
she's gonna check my account

09:47.951 --> 09:51.722
and that the balance
better be fat.

09:51.757 --> 09:52.921
- Same deal?

09:54.089 --> 09:56.584
So, we make some money!

09:56.619 --> 09:58.861
If that's what they care about,
we can do that!

10:00.359 --> 10:02.557
Okay. How much money
do you need to make in a summer?

10:02.592 --> 10:06.935
- Ah. Minimum wage
is about seven dollars an hour,

10:06.970 --> 10:08.398
30 hours a week.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.840
It's about ten weeks
till the end of August.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.138
Twenty-one hundred dollars.

10:12.173 --> 10:15.779
- Okay. Times two
to cover both of you is

10:15.814 --> 10:18.408
uh, carry the one uh.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.850
- It's 4,200 dollars.

10:20.885 --> 10:21.950
- We can totally make that!

10:21.985 --> 10:23.116
Yeah, by getting summer jobs.

10:23.151 --> 10:25.250
- No. We could do
that in a week!

10:25.285 --> 10:28.957
We just gotta do something easy
that has a really great pay-off!

10:28.992 --> 10:30.420
And then we spend the rest
of the summer kickin' it!

10:30.455 --> 10:31.795
- Oh. Get-rich-quick, you mean?

10:31.830 --> 10:33.830
Because that worked out
so well for so many people.

10:33.865 --> 10:35.700
- No, but we'll be different.

10:35.735 --> 10:36.833
We'll be smart about it!

10:36.868 --> 10:38.362
- Oh, 'cause nobody
ever said that before

10:38.397 --> 10:40.870
- Even if we did make
4,200 dollars in a week,

10:40.905 --> 10:42.102
our parents
would still expect us

10:42.137 --> 10:45.039
to go to work every day.

10:45.074 --> 10:47.778
- Yeah.
Well, that's the easy part.

10:47.813 --> 10:48.944
We lie.

10:48.979 --> 10:50.781
And tell them what?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.883
- Doesn't matter.
We just make up a fake job.

10:53.918 --> 10:56.281
You could be, uh, a lifeguard,

10:56.316 --> 10:57.887
and then you could be
a librarian!

10:57.922 --> 11:00.021
- No. No!
I can't lie like that.

11:01.321 --> 11:03.024
- And have you met my mom?

11:04.731 --> 11:05.829
Nothing will come between me

11:05.864 --> 11:07.391
and my goals.

11:07.426 --> 11:09.063
Repetition makes habits, right?

11:09.098 --> 11:11.065
So, repeat your affirmations.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.397
- I am confident,
I am capable,

11:13.432 --> 11:14.871
I will reach my goal.

11:14.906 --> 11:17.775
Because what
you focus on becomes true.

11:18.943 --> 11:21.207
Nothing
will come between me

11:21.242 --> 11:22.208
and my goals.

11:22.243 --> 11:23.748
- Uh cool.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.409
Do you mind if I come
between you and the fridge?

11:26.577 --> 11:28.412
- Don't make fun
of my affirmations.

11:28.447 --> 11:30.051
Clearly visualizing
what you want

11:30.086 --> 11:31.822
is a great way
to make it happen.

11:31.857 --> 11:36.024
- Oh, well, visualizing myself
with a glass of milk.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.929
Hey, it works!

11:39.964 --> 11:40.864
- Hilarious.

11:43.264 --> 11:45.396
Speaking of making things
happen,

11:45.431 --> 11:46.562
shouldn't you
be getting dressed?

11:46.597 --> 11:47.937
- For what?

11:47.972 --> 11:48.905
- You've got to start
looking for a new job.

11:50.205 --> 11:51.600
- I don't even get
a single day off?

11:51.635 --> 11:54.273
- No. Start early,
start strong!

11:54.308 --> 11:56.077
- That doesn't answer
my question.

11:56.112 --> 11:58.079
- We should have started
this process earlier,

11:58.114 --> 11:59.850
but I believe in you.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.346
And if you can't find
anything this late,

12:01.381 --> 12:03.887
I'll be happy to have you
as my intern.

12:03.922 --> 12:04.888
The Bayside Mall
is going to need

12:04.923 --> 12:06.219
a lot of extra help this summer.

12:06.254 --> 12:08.221
They've had
a spate of shoplifting

12:08.256 --> 12:12.764
and I am here
to restore community confidence.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.095
- But hold on a second,

12:14.130 --> 12:15.195
if you're gonna be spending
all day with your mom,

12:15.230 --> 12:16.933
I have dibs on the evenings!

12:16.968 --> 12:18.033
'Cause I know your mom,

12:18.068 --> 12:19.199
she can't be having
all the Dave-time,

12:19.234 --> 12:20.200
- huh!
- Ah

12:20.235 --> 12:21.366
Well, actually, the truth is,

12:21.401 --> 12:23.533
I--I stopped by the pool
on the way home,

12:23.568 --> 12:26.602
and I got a job.
As a lifeguard.

12:27.770 --> 12:28.736
- You did?

12:28.771 --> 12:29.737
- Are you certified for that?

12:29.772 --> 12:31.475
- Well, when does it start?

12:31.510 --> 12:32.784
- August 30th.

12:34.084 --> 12:35.545
Wh-Which is why I told them
I needed something sooner

12:35.580 --> 12:37.756
so they're gonna let me
start next week.

12:39.782 --> 12:40.825
- Fantastic!

12:41.828 --> 12:44.895
Wow. Good for you.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.490
-Way
to grab the bull

12:46.525 --> 12:47.898
by the horns, son.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.658
Eat up. Get strong.

12:54.632 --> 12:55.972
So, now what?

12:56.007 --> 12:57.666
- Now what, what?

12:57.701 --> 13:01.076
- I told my mom
I got a job at the pool.

13:01.111 --> 13:02.770
- You got a job
down at the pool?

13:02.805 --> 13:04.013
Yo, congrats!

13:04.048 --> 13:06.950
- The job isn't real.
The job is a lie.

13:06.985 --> 13:09.282
You told me to lie
about having a job.

13:09.317 --> 13:10.415
That was the plan.

13:10.450 --> 13:13.891
So I'm saying I'm in,
so now what?

13:15.059 --> 13:16.993
- Oh.
Yes, of course, the plan!

13:17.028 --> 13:20.326
The plan! Operation

13:20.361 --> 13:21.899
Let's Have a Great Summer!

13:22.902 --> 13:24.462
Yeah, all right. Yeah.
We'll work on that name.

13:24.497 --> 13:28.004
But, dude, congrats.
Welcome aboard.

13:28.039 --> 13:29.973
First order of business:
A mascot!

13:30.008 --> 13:31.876
And I saw just the thing.

13:36.839 --> 13:39.312
We'll call him Mr. Moneybags,

13:39.347 --> 13:41.215
and he represents
all the cash we're gonna make

13:41.250 --> 13:42.986
to get you out
of your summer job.

13:43.021 --> 13:46.352
- It's called Maneki-neko,
and it represents good fortune.

13:46.387 --> 13:48.354
- Yeah. Literally
what I just said.

13:48.389 --> 13:49.487
Are you buying another book?

13:49.522 --> 13:51.720
- Curtis! Plan!

13:51.755 --> 13:55.526
Mascots are great, but what's
our plan to make 4,200 dollars?

13:55.561 --> 13:57.902
My life depends on it!

14:00.533 --> 14:01.873
- Okay.

14:01.908 --> 14:04.304
You guys ever hear of
the Calvin Labash coin robbery?

14:04.339 --> 14:05.976
The what?

14:06.011 --> 14:10.178
- Last year, a masked thief
robbed an antique coin shop.

14:10.213 --> 14:11.377
It's a store downtown

14:11.412 --> 14:14.017
owned by a man named
Calvin Labash.

14:14.052 --> 14:15.887
Labash hit the silent alarm,

14:15.922 --> 14:17.713
but by the time
the police arrived,

14:17.748 --> 14:19.352
the thief had already run off,

14:19.387 --> 14:20.991
carrying dozens of gold coins

14:21.026 --> 14:23.158
worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.160
The police spotted him
and chased him.

14:25.195 --> 14:27.261
But he disappeared
down an alley.

14:27.296 --> 14:29.032
It would've been
the perfect crime,

14:29.067 --> 14:30.726
except for one thing.

14:30.761 --> 14:33.828
Labash recognized the cologne
the thief was wearing.

14:33.863 --> 14:37.238
He only knew one person
who wore that particular scent:

14:37.273 --> 14:40.604
none other than
City Councilman Ron Haft.

14:40.639 --> 14:41.836
- Why would he do that?

14:41.871 --> 14:43.013
- Apparently,
some politicians lie

14:43.048 --> 14:45.246
about their financial status.

14:45.281 --> 14:48.876
Anyway, the police
questioned Councilman Haft

14:48.911 --> 14:51.021
and they even searched
his home and office.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.551
But they found no sign
of the gold coins.

14:53.586 --> 14:56.928
Still, Labash was certain
that Haft had stolen them.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.557
So he went
and confronted him directly.

14:59.592 --> 15:04.298
Tempers flared, and Labash
ended up killing Haft.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.939
Calvin Labash was arrested
for the murder of Ron Haft

15:07.974 --> 15:10.073
and was sentenced to
life in prison.

15:10.108 --> 15:12.570
But he killed himself
the week his sentence began.

15:14.937 --> 15:16.772
And no one heard
another thing about it.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.985
- This felt extremely off-topic.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.956
- The coins, Dave!
The coins were never found!

15:24.991 --> 15:27.255
Haft must have hidden them
somewhere in the city!

15:27.290 --> 15:28.817
And we're gonna find them!

15:28.852 --> 15:31.259
- Sorry, Curtis,
but if this is your big plan,

15:31.294 --> 15:32.821
I do not consent.

15:32.856 --> 15:35.263
I'm better off just going to
my interviews and taking a job.

15:35.298 --> 15:37.397
- Curtis, I cannot believe you.

15:37.432 --> 15:40.004
For once, you came up with
a realistic-sounding idea

15:40.039 --> 15:42.270
and this is how
we're gonna accomplish it?

15:42.305 --> 15:43.975
Hunting through the city
for a treasure

15:44.010 --> 15:45.306
that probably
doesn't even exist.

15:45.341 --> 15:46.604
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:46.639 --> 15:48.144
Look, I know it sounds
a little far-fetched

15:48.179 --> 15:49.508
- Oh, a little?

15:49.543 --> 15:51.312
- But no need to get personal!

15:51.347 --> 15:54.909
'Cause I've got a Plan B.
I always have a Plan B!

15:54.944 --> 15:56.955
- Yeah, your middle name
is Plan B.

15:59.388 --> 16:01.586
- So, I'm listening!

16:01.621 --> 16:02.686
- Uhhh

16:03.986 --> 16:05.458
A garage sale.

16:05.493 --> 16:07.097
A garage sale.
We hold a garage sale.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.527
- You just came up
with that this very minute.

16:08.562 --> 16:10.199
- Look, we sell our stuff.

16:10.234 --> 16:13.499
Our clubhouse has got years
of accumulated merchandise.

16:13.534 --> 16:15.501
All that's gotta be worth
more than 4,000.

16:15.536 --> 16:16.964
- But how are we supposed to
have a fun summer

16:16.999 --> 16:19.439
without all of our stuff?

16:19.474 --> 16:22.046
- Maybe Curtis is right, Dave.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.542
I mean, it's just stuff.

16:23.577 --> 16:25.940
And besides, Operation
Let's All Have a Great Summer

16:25.975 --> 16:27.282
- Not committed to that name.

16:27.317 --> 16:30.186
- was always just about us
spending it together.

16:30.221 --> 16:31.550
I mean, we could
make that choice.

16:31.585 --> 16:32.683
We could sacrifice our stuff

16:32.718 --> 16:34.190
for one last
easy summer together.

16:35.193 --> 16:36.357
- Are you saying you're in?

16:36.392 --> 16:37.886
- Heck, yes, she is.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.724
- All right.
Let's make some summer money.

16:40.759 --> 16:42.957
- So we can have
some summer fun.

16:42.992 --> 16:44.332
Garage sale!

16:44.367 --> 16:47.038
- Okay. But where are we
going to hold it?

16:47.073 --> 16:48.963
- I don't know.
What about your uncle's?

16:51.506 --> 16:53.902
So, we thought
we'd come to you, Uncle Brad,

16:53.937 --> 16:56.641
since you're family and all.

16:56.676 --> 17:00.876
- So, you want to
sell all of your clubhouse gear

17:00.911 --> 17:04.011
and knickknacks to buy
a present for your mom?

17:04.046 --> 17:05.815
- Well, not just any present!

17:05.850 --> 17:09.016
Uh, you know those motivational
videos that she likes?

17:09.051 --> 17:11.194
Well, there's an online guru

17:11.229 --> 17:14.593
that has a whole course
that we want to get her!

17:14.628 --> 17:17.893
- Yeah, she's really into those.

17:17.928 --> 17:19.598
But our garage is full up
now that Uncle Michael

17:19.633 --> 17:21.996
has the new self-driving
electric car.

17:22.031 --> 17:25.538
- Yes. But they could use
the front porch and the yard.

17:25.573 --> 17:29.773
- Right. But you're also
asking me to lie to my sister.

17:29.808 --> 17:33.843
- Not lie!
Just not fully disclose.

17:33.878 --> 17:34.910
- Oh.

17:34.945 --> 17:36.285
We need to keep our eye
on that one.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.452
- It should be a surprise,
after all!

17:38.487 --> 17:39.882
We just want to do something
really nice for her

17:39.917 --> 17:42.489
before we start our summer jobs.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.195
- Uh, I just don't know

17:45.230 --> 17:47.021
if I can keep something
like that from Megan.

17:47.056 --> 17:50.398
She has a way of dragging
the truth out of people.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.236
- Look, I get it. Yeah.

17:53.271 --> 17:56.030
I told Dave that you guys
would never go for this.

17:56.065 --> 17:58.802
You know, kids shouldn't be
encouraged to dream,

17:58.837 --> 18:01.607
have big ideas, right?
It's just too risky.

18:01.642 --> 18:04.280
Dave almost had me convinced
that you guys were different.

18:04.315 --> 18:07.041
That you'd see we just wanted
to do something nice for his mom

18:07.076 --> 18:08.614
because she works
really, really hard.

18:08.649 --> 18:11.078
But, you know,
I'm with you guys.

18:11.113 --> 18:13.454
You know, can't take a chance
on a kid's dream.

18:15.293 --> 18:17.293
Look, you can't
blame 'em, buddy.

18:17.328 --> 18:19.658
You know, they're just adults.

18:19.693 --> 18:21.627
They're all like that.

18:21.662 --> 18:23.992
We'll just, uh,
figure something else out.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.601
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait!

18:29.802 --> 18:32.066
O--okay.
You-- you can do it.

18:32.101 --> 18:33.672
- Really?
-  Yes.

18:33.707 --> 18:35.311
- Okay, so the sale
will be on Saturday

18:35.346 --> 18:36.312
from noon to five.

18:36.347 --> 18:37.973
We have a lot of stuff,

18:38.008 --> 18:39.480
so we're gonna need your help
driving everything over here,

18:39.515 --> 18:41.515
and we're gonna need to store
everything in your basement.

18:42.815 --> 18:44.683
- We've just been played,
haven't we?

18:44.718 --> 18:46.157
- I told you
to watch out for him!

19:02.901 --> 19:03.999
- Oh, hey, Mom!

19:04.034 --> 19:05.275
I just put my work schedule
on the fridge

19:05.310 --> 19:07.673
so I don't forget it.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.971
- Dave!

19:09.006 --> 19:11.809
I have never known you
to be so conscientious.

19:11.844 --> 19:14.548
You are really
taking this by storm!

19:15.980 --> 19:17.782
Are you nervous?

19:17.817 --> 19:19.322
- About what?

19:19.357 --> 19:21.291
- Well, you're going to be in
charge of saving people's lives.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.688
- When?

19:22.723 --> 19:23.821
- At the pool.

19:25.187 --> 19:28.397
- Because I'm a lifeguard
at the pool!

19:28.432 --> 19:30.531
No. I'm not!

19:30.566 --> 19:31.565
Nervous! I mean.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.897
I'm not-- I'm not nervous.

19:33.932 --> 19:37.340
Um, you know, I gotta go!
It's a really long bike ride!

19:37.375 --> 19:38.473
- Well, hold on, hold on.

19:38.508 --> 19:39.870
You have another hour,
so sit down.

19:39.905 --> 19:42.411
I'll make you breakfast
and then I'll drive you over.

19:42.446 --> 19:43.412
- No, Dad! No.

19:43.447 --> 19:45.315
Uh, I want to get there myself.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.175
If you're gonna do something,
do it all the way! Right?

19:48.210 --> 19:49.913
- Yeah. Uh, yeah.

19:49.948 --> 19:52.179
Wake up determined,
go to bed satisfied!

19:52.214 --> 19:54.049
- Okay, bye.

19:54.084 --> 19:56.425
- Truer words, Dad!
Truer words!

20:29.493 --> 20:34.496
Upon a summer's day

20:39.635 --> 20:43.604
Filled with envy

20:45.641 --> 20:50.611
To pass the time away

21:46.867 --> 21:48.163
- You guys look ready.

21:48.198 --> 21:49.164
- Not quite!

21:53.676 --> 21:54.642
For luck.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.882
- Wow, you have
a lot of great stuff here.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.361
Would you take 25?

22:11.859 --> 22:16.862
My lucky day

22:18.195 --> 22:21.064
Hey hey my lucky day

22:25.675 --> 22:28.071
Or to be told

22:28.106 --> 22:33.109
It's my lucky day

22:34.618 --> 22:37.850
It's my lucky day hey hey

22:54.363 --> 22:57.034
Or to be told

22:57.069 --> 22:59.608
It's my lucky day

23:17.254 --> 23:19.089
- So, how much did we make?

23:19.124 --> 23:20.860
- I'm counting, I'm counting!

23:20.895 --> 23:21.993
- Well?

23:23.425 --> 23:24.864
- Four thousand two hundred
thirty seven dollars

23:24.899 --> 23:26.129
and twenty five cents.

23:26.164 --> 23:27.966
We did it.
We actually did it!

23:28.001 --> 23:29.935
- Well, didn't I
tell you guys to trust me?

23:29.970 --> 23:32.366
- Dude, you're saving me a whole
summer's worth of hard labor.

23:32.401 --> 23:33.367
- That's what
I'm talking about.

23:33.402 --> 23:34.643
Hey, buddy!

23:34.678 --> 23:36.744
Sir, what are you
doing with that?

23:36.779 --> 23:37.910
- How much you want for it?

23:37.945 --> 23:39.879
- We made enough, Curtis.

23:39.914 --> 23:41.650
- Well, how much
is it worth to ya?

23:41.685 --> 23:42.915
- It's a piece of junk.
Five bucks?

23:44.083 --> 23:45.489
- You'll have to do
better than that!

23:45.524 --> 23:47.315
- But the sign says
everything must go.

23:47.350 --> 23:49.724
- If it's a piece of junk,
why do you want it so much?

23:49.759 --> 23:51.627
Curtis!
- You can't have it!

23:59.428 --> 24:00.966
- Five thousand dollars?

24:01.001 --> 24:03.771
How does a new windshield
cost 5,000 dollars?

24:03.806 --> 24:06.576
- That windshield could
probably drive the car for you.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.908
- I don't think Uncle Brad
is gonna rat us out

24:08.943 --> 24:11.746
but that's only because
we gave him the 4,200 bucks

24:11.781 --> 24:13.341
we made from selling our stuff.

24:13.376 --> 24:17.851
So, eventually, we're gonna have
to pay him back the difference.

24:17.886 --> 24:19.149
- You do realize that this means

24:19.184 --> 24:21.349
that your brilliant,
simple, can't-miss

24:21.384 --> 24:22.922
Operation
Let's All Have a Great Summer

24:22.957 --> 24:24.352
- We're changing that name!

24:24.387 --> 24:26.354
- has only been in operation
for a single week,

24:26.389 --> 24:28.499
and we're already
800 dollars in the hole!

24:29.491 --> 24:30.963
- Look, guys.

24:30.998 --> 24:32.459
Look, this doesn't
actually change anything.

24:32.494 --> 24:33.966
You know, our goal
is still the same,

24:34.001 --> 24:36.837
just, you know,
numbers are a little fudged.

24:36.872 --> 24:37.970
- But this was
your only good idea

24:38.005 --> 24:39.675
on how to make any money at all.

24:39.710 --> 24:40.808
- You lie, sir!

24:40.843 --> 24:42.975
I never lie, Curtis.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.274
- Look, my best idea
still stands!

24:45.309 --> 24:46.440
- What idea?

24:46.475 --> 24:48.552
- The Labash Coin Robbery!

24:48.587 --> 24:49.982
Look, what I didn't tell you is,

24:50.017 --> 24:52.985
I think I know
where the stolen coins are!

24:53.020 --> 24:54.756
The Chinatown Tunnels!

24:55.990 --> 24:57.022
- That's an urban legend.

24:57.057 --> 25:00.993
- Oooohhhh.
Or perfect hiding place?

25:01.930 --> 25:04.700
Look, the thief
stole the coins on foot,

25:04.735 --> 25:06.933
so he had to have
some kind of getaway, right?

25:08.167 --> 25:10.002
And if Councilman Haft
did steal the coins

25:10.037 --> 25:11.465
and hide them somewhere,

25:11.500 --> 25:13.302
then the secret underground
Chinatown Tunnels

25:13.337 --> 25:14.875
would have been
the perfect place.

25:14.910 --> 25:16.811
And as City Councilman,

25:16.846 --> 25:18.582
he would have known
the exact location.

25:20.179 --> 25:22.047
That's why the police
didn't find the coins

25:22.082 --> 25:23.510
when they searched his office.

25:23.545 --> 25:26.117
Because he hid them
in the tunnels!

25:28.055 --> 25:32.926
- Dude, my mom thinks
I have a job at the pool.

25:32.961 --> 25:35.731
She expects me to have
cold hard cash in my account

25:35.766 --> 25:37.392
in less than two months.

25:37.427 --> 25:41.869
So, if you do not downshift
into a realistic gear,

25:41.904 --> 25:43.398
she is gonna find out,

25:43.433 --> 25:47.534
and you are literally going to
find my body out in the bay.

25:47.569 --> 25:49.041
- Stay the course, my friend.
All right?

25:49.076 --> 25:51.373
Summer's not even half over yet.

25:51.408 --> 25:54.915
And, as always,
I have a Plan B.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.378
- Well, don't you mean Plan C?

25:56.413 --> 25:58.787
- That's the spirit!
Okay. Mall.

25:58.822 --> 26:00.514
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

26:00.549 --> 26:03.550
And all you gotta bring
is your hunger for the summer.

26:03.585 --> 26:07.389
We'll call this
Operation Sweet Life!

26:08.733 --> 26:10.326
We've gotta work on that name.

26:15.069 --> 26:16.035
Shortcuts aren't always good

26:16.070 --> 26:17.300
in the long run.

26:17.335 --> 26:19.709
The path may not be
straight or clear,

26:19.744 --> 26:21.975
so just keep your eyes
on your goal.

26:22.010 --> 26:23.977
And repeat your affirmations,

26:24.012 --> 26:26.914
because what you focus on
becomes true.

26:29.985 --> 26:31.578
- Why are you all dressed up?

26:31.613 --> 26:35.054
- Oh, I'm meeting with a few
new retail clients at the mall.

26:35.089 --> 26:36.957
- The mall?

26:36.992 --> 26:39.927
- A couple of the
high-end stores are being
shoplifted regularly.

26:39.962 --> 26:42.457
Antiques, handmade keepsakes.

26:42.492 --> 26:44.899
They're considering
posting a reward.

26:44.934 --> 26:46.494
Even the staff
is being affected.

26:47.937 --> 26:51.004
I am confident, I am capable,
I will reach my goal.

26:51.039 --> 26:54.139
- Dave, do you plan
on saving any lives today?

26:54.174 --> 26:55.140
- Just one.

26:55.175 --> 26:57.010
- Hop to it, Mr. Lifeguard!

26:57.045 --> 26:59.441
Don't let your mom
catch you being late for work!

26:59.476 --> 27:00.508
- But I just--
- Come on.

27:00.543 --> 27:02.015
Uh, do you want me to drive you!

27:02.050 --> 27:03.445
I could drive you.

27:03.480 --> 27:04.688
Are you sure?

27:07.154 --> 27:08.516
'Cause I don't mind
driving you.

27:15.162 --> 27:17.294
- So, my mom is going to be
all over this mall today,

27:17.329 --> 27:19.098
so we gotta
keep our eyes peeled.

27:19.133 --> 27:20.627
- What do we say
if we run into her?

27:20.662 --> 27:22.838
- Don't worry. I'll handle
anything that happens.

27:22.873 --> 27:26.006
This is where our prize is,
this is where we gotta be.

27:36.018 --> 27:37.314
Sorry.
- S'okay.

27:46.325 --> 27:47.995
- So, this is our big prize?

27:48.030 --> 27:49.128
A jar of jelly beans?

27:49.163 --> 27:50.899
We might as well
play the lottery.

27:50.934 --> 27:52.835
We risk running into my mom
for this?

27:52.870 --> 27:54.661
- Ah. It's only gambling
if you're guessing.

27:54.696 --> 27:55.805
- So what, we each take a guess?

27:55.840 --> 27:58.467
- No. They'll be guessing.
We won't be!

27:58.502 --> 27:59.468
That's part two.

27:59.503 --> 28:00.843
- Excuse me!

28:00.878 --> 28:02.207
- Oh! Sorry.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.854
- So, what is part two?

28:11.889 --> 28:13.053
- You'll see!

28:13.088 --> 28:14.648
- Hey, we used to have
a lamp just like this

28:14.683 --> 28:15.858
back at our old clubhouse.

28:15.893 --> 28:17.354
Except oh, wait!

28:17.389 --> 28:19.763
You sold it at
our pointless garage sale!

28:29.104 --> 28:31.775
- Hey, this is like
the jar with the jellybeans.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.844
- Yup, I figured they got it
somewhere inside this mall.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.109
Huh? Huh?

28:36.144 --> 28:37.275
- Now what?

28:37.310 --> 28:38.309
- You'll see!

28:43.921 --> 28:45.855
- Hey, look, we have one
of these back at the clubhouse.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.120
Except-- oh, wait!

28:47.155 --> 28:50.024
You also sold that
at our pointless garage sale!

28:50.059 --> 28:51.586
- Would you just let it go?

28:51.621 --> 28:53.390
Oh. Here we go. Perfect.

28:53.425 --> 28:54.424
Hold that. Thanks.

28:55.625 --> 28:56.591
Hold that.

28:58.837 --> 29:01.101
- So we're gonna put
the jellybeans in the jar?

29:01.136 --> 29:02.399
- Precisely.

29:02.434 --> 29:04.368
- So, you wanna spend
the money we don't have

29:04.403 --> 29:07.206
on jellybeans we can't afford
to fill a jar we don't need

29:07.241 --> 29:08.735
in order to make up
for a garage sale

29:08.770 --> 29:10.781
that we shouldn't have had
in the first place?

29:10.816 --> 29:12.948
- Hey, you gotta spend money
to make money!

29:12.983 --> 29:14.444
And, uh, Hannah

29:14.479 --> 29:15.786
- What?

29:15.821 --> 29:17.282
- We're gonna need
your math skills.

29:17.317 --> 29:18.745
- For jellybeans?

29:18.780 --> 29:21.583
- For 5,000 dollars
and a summer of sweet,

29:21.618 --> 29:23.090
sweet nothing.

29:23.125 --> 29:24.894
Fine.
Let's crunch the numbers.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.258
- Duck!
I am confident,

29:26.293 --> 29:28.623
I am capable--

29:28.658 --> 29:29.833
- What is she saying?

29:29.868 --> 29:31.263
- They're her
daily affirmations.

29:31.298 --> 29:32.803
She says them constantly.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.102
- I am confident,
I am capable,

29:35.137 --> 29:37.269
I will reach my goal.

29:37.304 --> 29:40.976
- I like condiments,
it's inescapable,

29:41.011 --> 29:43.275
pay the grasshopper's toll?

29:43.310 --> 29:45.013
- Oh, so you read lips now?

29:57.962 --> 29:59.192
- So?

29:59.227 --> 30:00.930
- What?

30:00.965 --> 30:01.931
- What now?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.295
- We count them.

30:03.330 --> 30:04.835
- All of them?

30:04.870 --> 30:05.968
- Yeah. How did you think
this was gonna work?

30:06.003 --> 30:07.970
- That'll take hours! Days!

30:08.005 --> 30:10.467
- Psh, nah.

30:10.502 --> 30:11.974
Yeah, maybe a day.

30:12.009 --> 30:14.845
- I thought you said we were
gonna need Hannah's math skills!

30:14.880 --> 30:16.341
- Yeah. She's gonna keep count!

30:16.376 --> 30:19.014
- That's just counting!
That's not math!

30:19.049 --> 30:20.708
- Six thousand,
seven hundred and thirty.

30:20.743 --> 30:21.984
- Wow.
- Rain Man?

30:22.019 --> 30:23.051
- Give or take
half of a percent.

30:23.086 --> 30:24.514
I just calculated
the volume of the jar

30:24.549 --> 30:27.022
and the volume
of each individual jellybean,

30:27.057 --> 30:28.815
and then I accounted for
the oblong displacement

30:28.850 --> 30:30.718
to factor in the empty space
between beans.

30:30.753 --> 30:33.028
It's basic geometry.
You can't argue with it.

30:33.063 --> 30:34.293
- No, you can't!

30:34.328 --> 30:35.998
And you can't argue
with 5,000 big ones either!

30:36.033 --> 30:37.560
See, I told you
we had this made!

30:37.595 --> 30:38.792
- Though I won't give you
full credit

30:38.827 --> 30:40.035
considering you thought
my "math skills"

30:40.070 --> 30:41.564
comprised of only counting,

30:41.599 --> 30:43.874
I will admit
this was a pretty decent plan.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.371
- You're welcome.

30:46.406 --> 30:48.472
The very first thing
we're gonna get is a new couch.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.348
- Excuse me.

31:03.786 --> 31:05.720
Okay.

31:05.755 --> 31:07.755
Is everyone ready to hear
the correct number

31:07.790 --> 31:09.559
of jellybeans in the jar?

31:09.594 --> 31:12.562
Yes.
- Yes. Okay. Here we go.

31:12.597 --> 31:17.600
And the actual number is 6,721!

31:18.867 --> 31:22.011
- We're within 10 jellybeans!
We have to be the winners!

31:22.046 --> 31:24.013
- And the winner
of the 5,000 dollars,

31:24.048 --> 31:25.916
the person
with the closest guess

31:25.951 --> 31:30.580
to the actual number
of jellybeans, is Emma Gleason!

31:30.615 --> 31:34.419
Whose guess, wow, get this,
was within four jellybeans!

31:39.998 --> 31:40.854
- How?

31:40.889 --> 31:42.064
- But that's impossible!

31:42.099 --> 31:43.725
I accounted for everything.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.936
No one could have made a more
accurate calculation, unless

31:45.971 --> 31:49.137
- Unless she counted
every single bean.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.141
Emma, congrats.

31:53.176 --> 31:54.802
Come on up here.

31:56.344 --> 31:59.609
Wow. This is all yours.

32:01.349 --> 32:02.920
- I don't understand.

32:22.634 --> 32:24.271
So now we're out
800 dollars for the windshield

32:24.306 --> 32:27.241
and 35.50 for the jar
and the jellybeans.

32:27.276 --> 32:29.936
- The plan was
to always count the beans.

32:29.971 --> 32:31.773
I don't know why we didn't
just stick to the plan!

32:31.808 --> 32:33.445
- Hey, calm down, okay?

32:33.480 --> 32:34.941
Counting the beans
would've taken forever!

32:34.976 --> 32:37.020
And Hannah's calculation
was pretty close!

32:37.055 --> 32:38.945
- Yeah.
A fat lot of good it did us.

32:38.980 --> 32:41.915
And since when do we change
our approach on the fly?

32:41.950 --> 32:43.323
- Curtis!
Literally everything

32:43.358 --> 32:46.029
you've ever come up with
has been on the fly!

32:46.955 --> 32:48.691
- Okay, but I don't see
you and Hannah

32:48.726 --> 32:50.132
coming up with anything!

32:50.167 --> 32:52.332
All you've done is just
shoot down my ideas one by one!

32:52.367 --> 32:53.861
- Hey, Operation Sweet Life

32:53.896 --> 32:54.862
- We're not calling it
that anymore.

32:54.897 --> 32:57.535
- was your big plan!

32:57.570 --> 33:00.868
- Oh, okay.
So now it's my fault?

33:00.903 --> 33:03.706
It's my fault that you didn't
want to get a summer job?

33:03.741 --> 33:06.973
It's my fault that you two
were just gonna give up

33:07.008 --> 33:08.843
your last easy summer?

33:08.878 --> 33:11.714
It's my fault
that I just wanted to spend

33:11.749 --> 33:14.189
some stupid time
with my stupid friends

33:14.224 --> 33:16.554
before the stupid world
sucks all the fun out of us?

33:16.589 --> 33:17.720
Curtis.

33:17.755 --> 33:19.161
- Hey, sit down.

33:19.196 --> 33:20.690
I'm sure there's something
that we can come up with.

33:20.725 --> 33:22.362
The summer's
not even halfway over.

33:22.397 --> 33:25.827
- There's nowhere to sit
because all our stuff is gone.

33:25.862 --> 33:27.334
Dude, I need out.

33:27.369 --> 33:28.863
It's like an oven in here, man.

33:28.898 --> 33:29.831
- Curtis!

33:33.034 --> 33:34.374
- What's gotten into him?

33:34.409 --> 33:35.969
- I don't know.

33:36.004 --> 33:37.212
Okay. I've never heard him
talk like that before.

33:37.247 --> 33:38.675
- I don't know
why he's getting so defensive.

33:38.710 --> 33:40.545
- He's doing this for you,
you know.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.712
- You don't think
he's doing it for you?

33:42.747 --> 33:44.912
- For us, maybe.

33:44.947 --> 33:45.979
We can't let him fail,
all right?

33:46.014 --> 33:48.190
We have to keep trying.

33:48.225 --> 33:50.522
- But what if we let this lie
go the entire summer

33:50.557 --> 33:53.723
and at the end, we both still
have empty bank accounts?

33:53.758 --> 33:56.231
There's no way that ends well.

33:56.266 --> 33:58.893
- You know me, I can't tell you
to lie to your parents.

33:58.928 --> 34:01.797
But I could help you
find a real job.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.038
- Maybe if I just tell them
I'm dying,

34:12.073 --> 34:14.744
they'll let me stay in bed
for the rest of the summer.

35:03.696 --> 35:05.927
- Congratulations.

35:05.962 --> 35:07.467
- What's goin' on?

35:07.502 --> 35:10.173
- Your mom, she just scored
two new clients today!

35:11.869 --> 35:13.968
- So, presentations went well?

35:14.003 --> 35:17.147
- And it's all due to
the power of positive thinking.

35:17.182 --> 35:19.611
- Well, yeah,
that and your hard work.

35:19.646 --> 35:24.649
Success: 10 percent inspiration,
90 percent perspiration!

35:25.850 --> 35:27.982
- I now have half the retail
businesses at the mall

35:28.017 --> 35:29.753
as my clients.

35:29.788 --> 35:31.326
So, in addition to
my other clients,

35:31.361 --> 35:34.263
I'm going to be very busy
for the rest of the summer!

35:34.298 --> 35:35.990
- Aren't you already very busy?

35:36.025 --> 35:37.024
- Yeah. Tell me about it!

35:37.059 --> 35:38.861
Between you two
and your new jobs,

35:38.896 --> 35:41.336
I hardly see anyone all day!

35:41.371 --> 35:42.865
- I think this little job
at the pool

35:42.900 --> 35:45.208
has been so great for you, Dave.

35:45.243 --> 35:48.035
I see you growing up.

35:48.070 --> 35:50.609
Taking responsibility.

35:50.644 --> 35:52.974
You should come work for me
a few evenings a week.

35:54.076 --> 35:55.977
- Ah, well, hold on. Hold on.

35:56.012 --> 35:57.220
I would never see him!

35:57.255 --> 35:59.981
It'd get kind of
lonely around here.

36:00.016 --> 36:02.049
- Oh. No, please.

36:02.084 --> 36:03.886
- Excuse me?

36:03.921 --> 36:06.020
- Please, I--I--I can't.

36:06.055 --> 36:07.395
- What do you mean?

36:08.926 --> 36:13.929
- Because because I agreed
to work the late shift

36:14.437 --> 36:15.667
at the pool.

36:15.702 --> 36:16.338
It's not on your schedule.

36:16.373 --> 36:17.471
- Just today.

36:17.506 --> 36:19.836
I told them,
so I can't back out now.

36:19.871 --> 36:21.068
I'm really committed!

36:21.103 --> 36:23.345
- I guess you can't.

36:23.380 --> 36:25.248
- Every evening?

36:25.283 --> 36:27.976
- Well, if you're gonna
do something,

36:28.011 --> 36:29.912
do it all the way.
Right, Dad?

36:34.050 --> 36:36.259
- Truer words, Dave.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.526
True er words.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.541
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

36:54.576 --> 36:57.775
I told my mom I'm gonna work
nights at the pool.

36:57.810 --> 36:59.381
So, now, I'm gonna be out
'til 10 pm.

36:59.416 --> 37:00.943
I'm gonna starve to death.

37:00.978 --> 37:02.516
- Extra shifts?

37:02.551 --> 37:03.517
That means she's gonna be
expecting more money

37:03.552 --> 37:05.079
at the end of summer, too.

37:06.115 --> 37:07.950
- I didn't even
think about that!

37:07.985 --> 37:10.051
We couldn't even scrape
together five grand.

37:10.086 --> 37:12.229
I'm so toast!

37:13.463 --> 37:14.792
- No worries, pal.

37:14.827 --> 37:17.300
Turns out,
I am your bread and butter.

37:17.335 --> 37:19.027
- What do you mean?

37:19.062 --> 37:20.270
- He was right.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.030
- Ah! Second time
she's said that this summer.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.306
I think she's warming up to me.

37:23.341 --> 37:25.407
- The Chinatown Tunnels
are real.

37:25.442 --> 37:26.771
And I think that's where
Councilman Haft

37:26.806 --> 37:27.805
hid the Labash coins.

37:29.578 --> 37:31.039
- You're kidding.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.612
- I was up all last night
cross-referencing.

37:32.647 --> 37:34.482
There's certainly mention
of historic tunnels

37:34.517 --> 37:35.978
under old Chinatown.

37:36.013 --> 37:37.485
Hints of secret entrances
scattered around.

37:37.520 --> 37:41.786
It's not obvious, but the traces
are definitely in here.

37:41.821 --> 37:44.624
And, this book belonged to Haft.

37:44.659 --> 37:46.494
It was at his estate sale
where I bought it.

37:46.529 --> 37:47.990
Which means he would have
known about the tunnels

37:48.025 --> 37:49.926
and maybe how to access them.

37:49.961 --> 37:50.927
Would have been
the perfect hiding spot

37:50.962 --> 37:52.258
for his stolen coins.

37:52.293 --> 37:54.436
I mean, this could be
our pay day after all.

37:54.471 --> 37:56.933
- So Operation Sweet Life
lives again.

37:56.968 --> 37:57.934
- Yeah.

37:57.969 --> 37:59.166
- "Pay Day."

38:02.974 --> 38:05.172
It's called
"Project Pay Day."

38:18.286 --> 38:20.253
- Downtown's a lot bigger
than I remember it.

38:20.288 --> 38:22.123
Are we sure we're in
the right neighborhood?

38:25.799 --> 38:27.260
- The tunnels
run under this entire area,

38:27.295 --> 38:28.437
according to the book.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.933
We just have to find
an entrance.

38:29.968 --> 38:30.835
- The book doesn't say
where one is?

38:30.870 --> 38:32.540
- No, it doesn't say.

38:32.575 --> 38:34.036
It wouldn't be a secret
if it did.

38:34.071 --> 38:36.038
Besides, that'll be too easy.

38:36.073 --> 38:37.347
- Too easy?

38:37.382 --> 38:38.612
I don't think
there is such a thing.

38:45.313 --> 38:47.148
- If we recreate
the scene of the crime,

38:47.183 --> 38:49.216
we could find the alleyway
Haft ducked down.

38:49.251 --> 38:51.284
Yo Dave, you pretend to be
a police officer,

38:51.319 --> 38:53.990
and I'll pretend to be Haft
and run from you.

38:54.025 --> 38:55.497
If I channel his thinking--
- Run!

38:55.532 --> 38:57.026
Wait, I haven't started--
- No, really. Run.

38:57.061 --> 38:58.060
It's my mom. Come on.

39:01.934 --> 39:04.231
I need to run.
- In here.

39:04.266 --> 39:05.540
No, the shoplifting
has been focused

39:05.575 --> 39:06.937
entirely around antiques--

39:10.514 --> 39:12.272
Three for lunch?

39:14.111 --> 39:16.012
- Yes. Three for lunch.

39:25.089 --> 39:26.858
Thank you.

39:26.893 --> 39:27.892
- Thanks.

39:28.895 --> 39:29.894
- Thanks.

39:31.359 --> 39:33.568
What are you thinking?
We can't afford this.

39:33.603 --> 39:35.196
- Well, I was thinking
that you need to spend money

39:35.231 --> 39:38.672
in order to make money.
Right, Curtis?

39:38.707 --> 39:40.839
You still have the money
from selling fake grades?

39:40.874 --> 39:42.775
- Oh, I completely
forgot about that.

39:44.372 --> 39:45.976
- Yeah,
but what are you thinking?

39:47.749 --> 39:49.045
- That if anyone
must know anything

39:49.080 --> 39:50.046
about these Chinatown Tunnels,

39:50.081 --> 39:51.344
it might be
the Chinese restaurant

39:51.379 --> 39:52.719
right above them.

39:53.755 --> 39:55.018
- You guys know what you want?

39:55.053 --> 39:57.086
- Ah, yes.
Three lunch specials, please,

39:57.121 --> 39:58.692
and some answers.

39:58.727 --> 40:01.090
We're looking for the entrance
to the Chinatown Tunnels.

40:03.424 --> 40:05.600
- I'm so sorry.
- Your father needs you.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.361
I'm so sorry.

40:08.396 --> 40:09.967
My son, he is so clumsy.

40:10.002 --> 40:11.606
- Oh, no.
It-- it was all my fault,

40:11.641 --> 40:13.773
I pulled the glass away
before he could do it.

40:13.808 --> 40:14.906
- Hmm Well.

40:14.941 --> 40:16.237
All right.

40:16.272 --> 40:21.275
Three lunch specials
and what else was there?

40:22.949 --> 40:24.916
- Uh, tea?

40:28.592 --> 40:33.595
- You will find no tunnel
here or elsewhere.

40:34.796 --> 40:38.996
Kindly do not insult us
by inquiring further.

40:53.683 --> 40:55.342
- Ah. Let me.

41:01.691 --> 41:03.449
Um, I'm sorry about before.

41:03.484 --> 41:05.352
I didn't mean to get you
in any trouble.

41:05.387 --> 41:06.958
- Would you like
an extra fortune cookie?

41:06.993 --> 41:08.190
- Oh, no, thanks.

41:09.963 --> 41:11.897
- Go ahead, take it.

41:14.462 --> 41:15.967
- Thanks.

41:23.471 --> 41:24.844
- That lady knows something!

41:24.879 --> 41:27.110
- Yeah, but who's gonna
make her tell us, you?

41:27.145 --> 41:28.848
She was scarier than my mom.

41:28.883 --> 41:31.378
- So, what did I spend
my last 30 bucks for, then?

41:31.413 --> 41:32.918
- For this.

41:34.251 --> 41:35.558
- Aren't you supposed to be
the sensible one

41:35.593 --> 41:36.889
in the band, right?

41:36.924 --> 41:38.319
Like, I'm the cute one,
you're the sensible one,

41:38.354 --> 41:40.123
and then Dave's Ringo.

41:40.158 --> 41:41.564
- He wanted me to have it.

41:41.599 --> 41:43.126
- Looks like Hannah's
the cute one after all.

41:43.161 --> 41:44.501
- Maybe I am.

41:48.364 --> 41:49.902
Look, see.
He wrote something on it.

41:49.937 --> 41:51.541
- Well, what does it say?

41:51.576 --> 41:54.137
- How did he manage to
get it inside the cookie?

41:54.172 --> 41:57.910
- "The entrance to the tunnels
is right in front of your face."

41:59.375 --> 42:00.715
Seems like a dead end.

42:00.750 --> 42:02.310
- Or it's a clue.

42:02.345 --> 42:03.509
"Right in front of your face."

42:03.544 --> 42:04.884
- And how did he get it
out of the cookie

42:04.919 --> 42:06.655
in the first place?

42:06.690 --> 42:08.382
- Oh, the face on the old clock?

42:08.417 --> 42:10.824
- No, but that's "a" face,
it's not "your" face.

42:10.859 --> 42:12.826
- I wanna know how he got it
out of the cookie

42:12.861 --> 42:14.564
and then back inside again.
- Tweezers!

42:14.599 --> 42:16.192
Would you give it a rest!

42:17.360 --> 42:19.096
- Oh, it's not right
in front of "your face"!

42:19.131 --> 42:21.098
It's "Yuri Pace"!
The town founder!

42:21.133 --> 42:23.034
He just had to write
really fast.

42:23.069 --> 42:24.332
- How would it be Yuri Pace?

42:24.367 --> 42:27.170
Hasn't he been dead
for like a hundred years?

42:27.205 --> 42:29.040
- We passed him on the way here!

42:43.826 --> 42:45.958
- This can't be right.
There's nothing here.

43:23.965 --> 43:26.097
Holy smokes, I was right.

43:26.132 --> 43:27.263
- Hannah was right.

43:27.298 --> 43:29.298
- Curtis was right.

43:29.333 --> 43:30.596
Let's just hope
he was also right

43:30.631 --> 43:33.005
about the stolen coins
being stashed down here.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.493
- Well, which way do we go?

43:59.528 --> 44:01.165
- There's light down that way.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.969
- Looks like the end
of the tunnel.

44:03.004 --> 44:05.708
According to the book, it should
overlook the Greenbelt pier.

44:05.743 --> 44:07.336
- Well, Haft didn't go
that way then.

44:09.538 --> 44:12.011
Keep your eyes peeled
for treasure.

44:30.592 --> 44:33.197
- Somebody painting pottery
down here?

44:33.232 --> 44:34.902
Look!

44:39.205 --> 44:40.600
- Open it.

44:42.604 --> 44:44.010
- I don't believe it.

44:44.045 --> 44:45.572
- If I'm dreaming,
don't wake me up.

44:45.607 --> 44:47.046
- We found it? We're free!

44:47.081 --> 44:48.047
- We're rich!

44:48.082 --> 44:49.444
- We're missing something

44:50.755 --> 44:53.019
these aren't the Labash coins.

44:53.054 --> 44:54.889
What does the map say?

44:54.924 --> 44:56.187
Up this way.

44:58.521 --> 45:00.488
Well, it better be,
'cause I'll kill anyone

45:00.523 --> 45:02.622
who gets between
me and that gold!

45:05.594 --> 45:07.198
What the ?

45:07.233 --> 45:08.969
Who are you?

45:10.434 --> 45:11.906
Who are you?

45:11.941 --> 45:13.600
What are you?

45:13.635 --> 45:16.603
- I am Gangrangle the Elder,
banished from the High Council,

45:16.638 --> 45:18.011
in seek of the Treasure
of Zalmut.

45:18.046 --> 45:20.607
Level 23 Wizard.

45:20.642 --> 45:22.081
- Cosplayers?

45:22.116 --> 45:24.083
- It's LARPers to you,
puny mortal.

45:24.118 --> 45:25.953
- What are you, a level two?

45:25.988 --> 45:28.384
- I'll level you,
you disgraced wand jockey.

45:28.419 --> 45:30.386
- So this gold isn't real?

45:30.421 --> 45:31.761
- Look, "real"
is just a concept

45:31.796 --> 45:33.191
society puts on things.

45:33.226 --> 45:35.688
Who's to say what's really real?

45:35.723 --> 45:37.162
- So, it's really not real?

45:38.660 --> 45:41.034
- So, do you guys play
dress-up down here a lot?

45:41.069 --> 45:42.068
We're LARPers!

45:42.103 --> 45:43.399
- And this is
kind of our territory.

45:43.434 --> 45:45.808
We've been on this quest
for months.

45:45.843 --> 45:47.370
- Months?

45:47.405 --> 45:48.635
- Begone!

45:48.670 --> 45:50.912
- Yeah, you're kind of
ruining the climax here.

45:50.947 --> 45:52.441
- So that means

45:52.476 --> 45:53.739
- The coins have probably
already been found.

45:53.774 --> 45:55.785
- Or they were never even here,
to begin with.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.611
Wait
are you guys LARPing too?

45:58.823 --> 46:00.020
- Narp.

46:08.965 --> 46:10.833
- I just I don't get it.

46:12.463 --> 46:14.969
- Well, try and keep up.

46:15.004 --> 46:16.234
It's halfway through summer.

46:16.269 --> 46:18.940
I'm working a double shift
at a fake job,

46:18.975 --> 46:21.811
and I have
a bank account of zero.

46:21.846 --> 46:23.340
- Yeah.
And we still owe Uncle Mike

46:23.375 --> 46:26.178
that 800 bucks for his car.

46:26.213 --> 46:27.817
- But everything lined up.

46:27.852 --> 46:30.149
All right, it all made sense,
so why didn't we find the coins?

46:30.184 --> 46:32.954
It just it feels strange.

46:32.989 --> 46:34.780
- It feels depressing.

46:35.860 --> 46:37.057
- It feels itchy.

46:39.556 --> 46:40.995
- It does feel itchy

46:42.790 --> 46:44.295
- Yeah, why does it feel itchy?

46:44.330 --> 46:46.231
Curtis, where'd you
get this couch?

46:47.696 --> 46:49.630
Fleas! Oh!

46:53.009 --> 46:54.470
Maybe we can
outrun them!

46:55.506 --> 46:56.846
This way!

47:14.525 --> 47:16.162
Can fleas hold their breath
for long?

47:16.197 --> 47:17.691
Dave?

47:17.726 --> 47:19.726
Aren't you three
supposed to be at work?

47:20.905 --> 47:22.366
Well, when you put it
like that

47:24.106 --> 47:26.370
it does look sort of bad.

47:32.675 --> 47:35.643
- I cannot believe you three!

47:35.678 --> 47:37.546
Especially you, Dave.

47:37.581 --> 47:39.812
I helped you out
and now I discover that I have

47:39.847 --> 47:43.057
inadvertently participated
in some grand conspiracy

47:43.092 --> 47:44.751
to hoodwink your mom.

47:44.786 --> 47:47.061
I mean, you do realize
she will kill me for this.

47:47.096 --> 47:49.063
- Right after
she's done killin' me.

47:49.098 --> 47:51.098
- Ugh. I don't doubt it.

47:51.133 --> 47:52.396
Jeez, Louise!

47:52.431 --> 47:54.002
You couldn't just get
normal summer jobs

47:54.037 --> 47:55.564
like every other teenager
your age?

47:55.599 --> 47:59.205
- Uncle Brad, Dave isn't like
other teenagers his age.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.273
His free time is potentially
very valuable to--

48:01.308 --> 48:04.012
- Okay, yeah. That's enough
from you, you little sneak.

48:04.047 --> 48:05.112
I mean, you're the one
who guilted me

48:05.147 --> 48:06.410
into helping you all
in the first place.

48:06.445 --> 48:08.082
- Brad! He's a kid.

48:08.117 --> 48:10.150
It's your own fault
for feeling so guilty!

48:13.716 --> 48:15.056
- I just don't know
what I'm supposed to do, Dave.

48:15.091 --> 48:16.618
I mean,
I have to tell your mother.

48:16.653 --> 48:19.093
And Hannah, aren't you supposed
to have a summer job, too?

48:19.128 --> 48:21.062
Guys, I'm sorry,
but I think this--

48:21.097 --> 48:22.888
this little plan of yours
is over.

48:24.661 --> 48:27.431
- Please, Uncle Brad,
give us one more chance

48:27.466 --> 48:29.972
to make the money
and pay Uncle Mike back.

48:30.007 --> 48:32.040
We still have a whole month
before she checks our account!

48:33.670 --> 48:36.473
Yeah. There's no way I could
keep this quiet for a month!

48:36.508 --> 48:38.475
What? You know my sister!
She gets things out of me!

48:38.510 --> 48:40.279
There's no way I'd make it.

48:40.314 --> 48:42.083
- Brad, let's give
them two weeks.

48:42.118 --> 48:43.447
I mean, we're going to Mexico.

48:43.482 --> 48:44.382
It's not like
you're gonna see her anyway.

48:44.417 --> 48:45.647
- We can do it in two weeks!

48:45.682 --> 48:46.956
Curtis!

48:46.991 --> 48:48.056
- All right, young man.

48:48.091 --> 48:50.124
You're so clever,
and so determined.

48:50.159 --> 48:52.258
What's the big plan
for making all this money?

48:52.293 --> 48:53.655
- I'll tell you!

48:53.690 --> 48:55.426
The stolen Labash coins

48:55.461 --> 48:57.791
hidden by the late
Councilman Haft in

48:57.826 --> 49:00.662
the secret-but-definitely-real
Chinatown Tunnels!

49:00.697 --> 49:03.467
- How how do you guys
know about those?

49:03.502 --> 49:06.272
- The tunnels?
They're real. We found them.

49:06.307 --> 49:07.603
- No, not the tunnels.

49:07.638 --> 49:08.835
I mean, where did you
learn about the coins

49:08.870 --> 49:10.573
that Mr. Labash had
in his store?

49:10.608 --> 49:13.444
They were
stolen last year!

49:13.479 --> 49:15.644
- They were actually stolen
long before that.

49:18.055 --> 49:19.417
The Labash coins,

49:19.452 --> 49:21.353
a century before they were
even known by that name,

49:21.388 --> 49:23.993
were stolen from a local bank
in Old Chinatown

49:24.028 --> 49:25.918
in the historic section
of the city.

49:25.953 --> 49:26.820
- How do you know that?

49:26.855 --> 49:28.459
- Oh, it's legend in my family.

49:28.494 --> 49:30.362
My mother would tell us
the story often.

49:31.728 --> 49:33.860
- Well, let's hear it!

49:33.895 --> 49:37.006
- Well, it all started
in the year 1885.

49:37.041 --> 49:39.503
That was the year that they ran
every single Chinese resident

49:39.538 --> 49:40.966
out of town.

49:41.001 --> 49:42.044
They had brought
the Chinese migrants here

49:42.079 --> 49:43.474
for cheap labor.

49:43.509 --> 49:45.377
But before long, the locals
began to turn against them.

49:45.412 --> 49:46.708
Began to blame
the Chinese immigrants

49:46.743 --> 49:48.908
for everything that was
going wrong in the city.

49:50.714 --> 49:52.813
I guess some things
never change.

49:52.848 --> 49:55.156
But, that's not the whole story.

49:55.191 --> 49:57.554
City officials told the Chinese
that they had one week

49:57.589 --> 49:58.555
to leave town.

49:58.590 --> 49:59.721
But these were their homes,

49:59.756 --> 50:01.228
and they had
no place else to go.

50:01.263 --> 50:03.494
When the locals found out that
the Chinese were resisting,

50:03.529 --> 50:05.958
things got more and more tense.

50:05.993 --> 50:08.961
All over town,
riots began to break out.

50:08.996 --> 50:11.832
And as always happens,
looters began to take advantage

50:11.867 --> 50:13.372
of the chaos.

50:13.407 --> 50:15.000
The payroll was stolen.

50:15.035 --> 50:17.343
And the locals tried to blame
the Chinese for the robbery.

50:18.907 --> 50:23.745
But my great-great grandmother,
a woman named Lei-Lei Tang,

50:23.780 --> 50:25.582
she knew better.

50:25.617 --> 50:27.386
She was a renowned gardener,

50:27.421 --> 50:28.981
and she'd been hired
by some of the locals

50:29.016 --> 50:30.983
to tend to their flowers.

50:31.018 --> 50:32.391
And as she was
going about her duties

50:32.426 --> 50:34.162
during of all the unrest,

50:34.197 --> 50:35.724
she happened to overhear
the people

50:35.759 --> 50:38.100
who had actually
committed the robbery.

50:38.135 --> 50:42.027
She saw what the men had
stolen. Dozens of gold coins,

50:42.062 --> 50:44.931
each imprinted
with a distinctive seal.

50:44.966 --> 50:47.901
- So, the coins are real!

50:47.936 --> 50:50.409
- And Mr. Labash must have
gotten them from his ancestors,

50:50.444 --> 50:52.114
those bank robbers?

50:52.149 --> 50:54.710
- Or bought them from
whoever did inherit them!

50:54.745 --> 50:56.184
- Perhaps you know,

50:56.219 --> 50:57.944
the Chinese History Museum
tried to purchase those coins

50:57.979 --> 51:00.518
from Mr. Labash several times
before their disappearance.

51:00.553 --> 51:02.883
They said those old coins
were part of

51:02.918 --> 51:04.093
Chinese-American history.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.589
The history of this city.

51:05.624 --> 51:07.426
But Mr. Labash always refused.

51:07.461 --> 51:10.957
The museum could never afford to
pay the real value of the coins.

51:12.136 --> 51:14.026
But

51:14.061 --> 51:15.401
What?

51:15.436 --> 51:17.931
- My mother always told
an extra piece of the story.

51:17.966 --> 51:20.307
I mean, who knows
whether it's true or not

51:20.342 --> 51:21.935
- Michael

51:21.970 --> 51:24.311
But my mother
told me the men got distracted,

51:24.346 --> 51:26.478
and Nana Lei-Lei
had a chance to steal

51:26.513 --> 51:29.074
some of those gold coins back.

51:29.109 --> 51:30.944
Lei-Lei was planning on
returning those coins

51:30.979 --> 51:33.254
to the bank,
but before she could,

51:33.289 --> 51:34.915
Chinatown was burning.

51:36.083 --> 51:38.050
She tried to run
to warn her family,

51:38.085 --> 51:40.954
and somewhere along the way,
she hid those coins.

51:40.989 --> 51:42.725
But it was too late.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.431
They rounded up
all of the Chinese immigrants.

51:45.466 --> 51:46.729
Lei-Lei tried to tell them

51:46.764 --> 51:47.763
she knew
where the stolen money was,

51:47.798 --> 51:49.138
but nobody would listen to her.

51:51.604 --> 51:54.066
- Did Lei-Lei ever come back
for the coins?

51:54.101 --> 51:55.804
Well, she
tried to, but by that time,

51:55.839 --> 51:59.005
the city had sunk the wreckage
of Chinatown into the bay.

51:59.040 --> 52:01.381
An attempt to erase this
chapter from their history.

52:02.813 --> 52:04.010
But it wasn't erased.

52:04.045 --> 52:06.012
Because Lei-Lei
told her daughter.

52:06.047 --> 52:07.981
And her daughter
told my grandmother.

52:08.016 --> 52:09.851
And my grandmother
told my mother.

52:09.886 --> 52:12.194
And she told me.

52:13.956 --> 52:16.330
- So, maybe Labash
didn't have all the coins!

52:16.365 --> 52:18.926
Maybe they were never
in the tunnel at all.

52:18.961 --> 52:21.093
- Wait, guys, I'm lost.

52:21.128 --> 52:22.468
- Don't you get it?

52:22.503 --> 52:24.338
If Lei-Lei stole the coins
and hid them,

52:24.373 --> 52:26.032
the coins are in Old Chinatown!

52:26.067 --> 52:27.308
We were looking
in the wrong place!

52:27.343 --> 52:29.442
- But isn't Old Chinatown

52:29.477 --> 52:31.213
Underwater?

52:31.248 --> 52:32.247
- The bay.

52:33.250 --> 52:34.381
Thank you!
- Yeah.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.943
Uh. Thanks, Uncle Brad!

52:35.978 --> 52:37.681
- What--? What did I do?

52:37.716 --> 52:38.946
We'll see you
in two weeks!

52:38.981 --> 52:40.255
We're gonna get those coins!

52:41.258 --> 52:42.785
- Oh

53:16.887 --> 53:18.227
- Hello, Mister.

53:18.262 --> 53:21.494
Before you say anything,
have we got a deal for you!

53:21.529 --> 53:24.662
We know for a fact there's
a 100 percent real treasure

53:24.697 --> 53:26.532
located at the bottom
of the bay.

53:26.567 --> 53:28.336
And if you equip us
for the dive,

53:28.371 --> 53:30.998
we'll cut you in five
percent. No questions asked.

53:31.033 --> 53:33.033
- I got a question.

53:33.068 --> 53:34.199
How old are you?

53:34.234 --> 53:36.509
And you know,
there's a better question.

53:36.544 --> 53:37.939
How broke are you?

53:37.974 --> 53:39.248
- We're 15.
- We're 18.

53:39.283 --> 53:40.876
- And let's just
say all our funds

53:40.911 --> 53:43.285
are tied up in
this particular venture!

53:43.320 --> 53:45.881
These are genuine gold coins
from the 1850s

53:45.916 --> 53:46.915
we're talking about.

53:46.950 --> 53:48.521
Guaranteed to fetch
a handsome price.

53:48.556 --> 53:49.885
- Well, only if
we can find them.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.525
- Just imagine
a whole lot of dough.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.186
And five percent in your pocket.

53:54.221 --> 53:56.056
- Treasure hunters, huh?

53:57.257 --> 53:59.466
- So? What do you say?

54:08.741 --> 54:10.070
- I've got a counter-offer.

54:11.315 --> 54:12.974
You three come down here
and work for me on the dock

54:13.009 --> 54:15.977
in exchange for the use
of the dive equipment.

54:16.012 --> 54:18.947
Let's say
a day's work for a day diving.

54:21.754 --> 54:24.260
- Could I interest you
in a 10 percent cut?

54:45.448 --> 54:46.843
-It's my mom!

54:46.878 --> 54:48.350
Get in the boat.
-  --so much for

54:48.385 --> 54:50.616
meeting with me, Megan.

54:50.651 --> 54:53.355
Have you ever considered
opening an outlet version

54:53.390 --> 54:54.983
of the Dive Shop?

54:55.018 --> 54:58.855
There is a terrific space just
opening up at the Bayside Mall!

54:58.890 --> 55:00.087
- How does she keep
showing up like that?

55:00.122 --> 55:01.924
- She's everywhere.

55:01.959 --> 55:03.596
- I think your mom's Batman.

55:13.641 --> 55:14.838
- Man, I hope that's everything.

55:21.044 --> 55:24.276
- Okay. That's one day's work.

55:24.311 --> 55:25.816
- All right.

55:25.851 --> 55:26.850
You guys come back
tomorrow morning

55:26.885 --> 55:28.654
and we'll get you outfitted.

55:28.689 --> 55:30.150
Just remember
to bring your dive certs,

55:30.185 --> 55:32.988
and a major credit card
for the deposit.

55:33.023 --> 55:34.825
- Credit card?
We don't have credit cards!

55:34.860 --> 55:36.255
Deposit?

55:38.996 --> 55:41.062
I'm just
kidding with you!

55:41.097 --> 55:43.900
You guys leave your student IDs,
and we'll call it a deal.

55:43.935 --> 55:45.605
Go on. Get outta here.

55:46.740 --> 55:47.739
- Thanks.

56:15.736 --> 56:18.506
- So this is where
they sunk old Chinatown?

56:18.541 --> 56:20.002
- Amazing, isn't it?

56:20.037 --> 56:22.873
- All right.
Let's find some stolen coins!

56:24.206 --> 56:26.107
- It is bigger than
I thought it would be.

56:26.142 --> 56:29.847
- Well, they did sink a whole
neighborhood into it, so.

56:31.983 --> 56:33.081
- I'm just thinking

56:33.116 --> 56:34.522
do you really think
we can find the coins

56:34.557 --> 56:36.216
before your uncles
get back from Mexico?

56:36.251 --> 56:37.888
This is a lot of ground
to cover.

56:37.923 --> 56:39.527
We've got two
whole weeks to look!

56:39.562 --> 56:40.693
That's like forever!

56:40.728 --> 56:42.057
- Well, one week, technically.

56:43.764 --> 56:45.390
Because we'll have to work
another day at the docks

56:45.425 --> 56:46.732
in order to dive again.

56:46.767 --> 56:48.195
And the same thing
two days after that.

56:48.230 --> 56:51.264
- Fellas! Look, let's focus on
the positive here, yeah?

56:51.299 --> 56:53.607
We know exactly where
the coins are for sure!

56:53.642 --> 56:54.806
It's like basically
all the work.

56:54.841 --> 56:56.203
Now we just gotta find them!

57:01.980 --> 57:03.980
- We've done crazier things
before, Hannah.

57:10.351 --> 57:11.757
- I'm not too sure

57:21.868 --> 57:22.933
Anything?

57:22.968 --> 57:24.066
Nothing.

57:24.101 --> 57:25.232
It's got to
be here somewhere.

57:25.267 --> 57:26.266
Let's keep looking!

57:41.855 --> 57:43.690
Nothing.

57:43.725 --> 57:45.692
And I think we looked
here already anyway.

57:45.727 --> 57:46.990
- Then we need to keep looking.

57:47.960 --> 57:49.157
- Well, I'm out of air.

57:49.192 --> 57:51.093
Well, don't
breathe so much!

57:51.128 --> 57:52.765
And we'll just
come back tomorrow.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.701
- You mean,
the day after tomorrow.

57:54.736 --> 57:56.263
Because we need to
work another day.

57:56.298 --> 57:57.968
- Guys, this is going to work.

57:58.003 --> 57:59.871
All right? I promise.
Just keep faith!

58:02.073 --> 58:03.072
What?

58:04.141 --> 58:05.470
- I don't think we can do this.

58:05.505 --> 58:06.977
- Well, not with that attitude!

58:07.012 --> 58:08.979
And what other choice
do we have?

58:09.014 --> 58:10.475
I'm telling you, it's here.

58:10.510 --> 58:12.015
It's too good not to be true!

58:13.084 --> 58:14.479
- But we can't have been
the only people

58:14.514 --> 58:15.524
to have ever dived here.

58:16.659 --> 58:18.021
- Hannah, he's right.

58:18.056 --> 58:19.385
As long as we follow the plan

58:20.520 --> 58:21.992
there's no way
we won't find them.

58:42.542 --> 58:44.014
- Hey, buck up, guys!

58:44.049 --> 58:45.345
You think Pizarro

58:45.380 --> 58:47.688
found the golden city
of El Dorado in a day?

58:47.723 --> 58:49.855
Or Ponce de Leon
and the Fountain of Youth?

58:49.890 --> 58:51.824
- Pizarro never found El Dorado.

58:51.859 --> 58:54.057
And Ponce de Leon didn't find
the Fountain of Youth either.

58:56.061 --> 58:58.567
My bad.

58:59.900 --> 59:01.636
- My name's Hannah,
and I know everything.

59:38.642 --> 59:39.806
Anything?

59:40.941 --> 59:42.237
Just a whole
lot of these.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.076
Man.

59:59.927 --> 1:00:01.762
- You know, I thought the whole
point of Project Pay Day

1:00:01.797 --> 1:00:04.589
was that we didn't have to
spend the whole summer working.

1:00:04.624 --> 1:00:07.427
- Look, it's not about
not working anymore, Hannah.

1:00:07.462 --> 1:00:11.002
It's about literally surviving
the summer and my mom.

1:00:11.037 --> 1:00:13.235
So, please,
just concentrate on

1:00:13.270 --> 1:00:16.843
where we're gonna search
tomorrow, okay?

1:00:16.878 --> 1:00:18.471
- I think we should
just come clean.

1:00:18.506 --> 1:00:20.077
Hey!
Don't talk like that.

1:00:20.112 --> 1:00:21.815
Or you're gonna ruin our mojo.

1:00:21.850 --> 1:00:23.817
I'm telling you,
we're closing in.

1:00:23.852 --> 1:00:25.951
Let's just finish up here,

1:00:25.986 --> 1:00:28.151
get a good night's sleep
and then tomorrow's our day.

1:00:28.186 --> 1:00:29.988
Right? It's gotta be.

1:00:31.728 --> 1:00:32.859
All right? Come on.

1:00:38.966 --> 1:00:40.196
Your power words for today.

1:00:40.231 --> 1:00:43.771
Authenticity.
Transparency. Honesty.

1:00:43.806 --> 1:00:45.333
And repeat your--

1:00:45.368 --> 1:00:46.873
- Is that the only
bathing suit you have?

1:00:46.908 --> 1:00:49.975
What? I love this suit!

1:00:50.010 --> 1:00:51.878
Come on. If a big-time
lifeguard like Dave

1:00:51.913 --> 1:00:53.506
gets embarrassed
because his old man

1:00:53.541 --> 1:00:54.881
is wearing a suit like this,

1:00:54.916 --> 1:00:56.949
he's got bigger problems.

1:00:56.984 --> 1:00:58.049
Mm.

1:00:58.084 --> 1:00:59.886
I wish I could go with you, but

1:00:59.921 --> 1:01:01.789
with two new clients
having promotions this week,

1:01:01.824 --> 1:01:03.153
I am swamped!

1:01:03.188 --> 1:01:05.892
Ah, that's okay.
I totally understand.

1:01:05.927 --> 1:01:07.894
I was thinking about
going this evening anyway.

1:01:07.929 --> 1:01:10.358
You know, I mean, he's got
his usual double shift,

1:01:10.393 --> 1:01:13.867
plus I'm thinking, eh,
less crowded in the evenings.

1:01:16.872 --> 1:01:18.333
You think he'll be surprised?

1:01:19.908 --> 1:01:21.402
Nothing seems to faze that kid!

1:01:22.944 --> 1:01:24.504
- Come on, Curtis, pick up!

1:01:24.539 --> 1:01:25.813
- Yo, Davy.

1:01:25.848 --> 1:01:27.177
- Dude, emergency, emergency!
I need help!

1:01:27.212 --> 1:01:28.376
Mayday! Now!

1:01:28.411 --> 1:01:29.850
- What? What's going on?

1:01:29.885 --> 1:01:31.478
- Dude, my dad's on his way
to the pool!

1:01:31.513 --> 1:01:32.919
- Is the pool even
open this late?

1:01:32.954 --> 1:01:34.987
- Yeah, it is! And I'm supposed
to be working there!!

1:01:35.022 --> 1:01:37.385
- Oh. Ohhhhhh!

1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:38.826
Okay. I'm on it, dude.

1:01:38.861 --> 1:01:40.685
Get there as quickly as you can
and play lifeguard.

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.896
- Dude, everyone knows
I don't work there.

1:01:42.931 --> 1:01:44.898
- Just for ten minutes!
Pretend for ten minutes.

1:01:44.933 --> 1:01:46.834
And I promise
I'll get you out of there.

1:01:46.869 --> 1:01:47.868
All right, go!

1:01:54.470 --> 1:01:55.744
- Dave?

1:01:55.779 --> 1:01:57.240
- You need to get
to the pool right now.

1:01:57.275 --> 1:01:59.044
Dave's dad is on his way there
and you need to delay him.

1:01:59.079 --> 1:02:00.441
Give Dave time to get in.

1:02:00.476 --> 1:02:02.575
- No. No, Curtis.
You know I can't lie to adults.

1:02:02.610 --> 1:02:05.380
Dave needs us,
Hannah. He needs you.

1:02:05.415 --> 1:02:06.953
I need you. To go do this.

1:02:06.988 --> 1:02:08.284
Otherwise, Dave's dead!

1:02:08.319 --> 1:02:09.890
- Why can't you do it?

1:02:09.925 --> 1:02:11.925
- I'll be right behind you.
I just need to grab some things.

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:12.992
Please, Hannah!

1:02:14.655 --> 1:02:15.687
All right, go.

1:02:35.742 --> 1:02:37.610
Hello, sir.
-  Hi.

1:02:37.645 --> 1:02:39.986
I will take one ticket
for an evening swim.

1:02:42.958 --> 1:02:44.155
Thank you, sir.

1:02:46.027 --> 1:02:46.927
Hey.

1:02:49.756 --> 1:02:50.931
Just one.

1:02:52.198 --> 1:02:53.725
Cool. Thanks, man.

1:03:21.788 --> 1:03:23.293
- Um, hey, Mr. Lucas.

1:03:23.328 --> 1:03:24.756
- Whoa. Hey, Hannah.

1:03:24.791 --> 1:03:26.659
What--what are you doing here?

1:03:26.694 --> 1:03:29.332
- Oh. Well, uh,
um, I--

1:03:29.367 --> 1:03:31.664
I'm meeting, uh, Curtis here
in a little bit.

1:03:31.699 --> 1:03:33.941
- Are you guys
visiting Dave, too?

1:03:33.976 --> 1:03:35.041
- Yeah.

1:03:35.076 --> 1:03:36.273
- I tell you what,

1:03:36.308 --> 1:03:37.505
there is nothing like
an evening at the pool

1:03:37.540 --> 1:03:39.012
after a hard day's work, right?

1:03:39.047 --> 1:03:41.278
- Yeah, yeah.
You can say that again, sir!

1:03:41.313 --> 1:03:43.511
- So, how is your
summer job going?

1:03:43.546 --> 1:03:46.855
You're uh Dave told me
you're at the country club?

1:03:46.890 --> 1:03:48.516
N-No

1:03:48.551 --> 1:03:50.023
no, I'm not at--
- Oh, maybe he meant Curtis.

1:03:50.058 --> 1:03:51.288
Maybe Curtis does that,

1:03:51.323 --> 1:03:52.652
which makes sense
because he's so charming.

1:03:52.687 --> 1:03:55.127
He could just charm the pants
right off those

1:03:55.162 --> 1:03:57.624
tennis players.
- I--

1:03:57.659 --> 1:04:01.034
- Is everything okay? You seem
a little a little shaky.

1:04:01.069 --> 1:04:04.004
- Uh. No. I am, I am

1:04:04.039 --> 1:04:05.698
- Is everything okay
with your summer job?

1:04:05.733 --> 1:04:07.337
Well, well

1:04:07.372 --> 1:04:08.976
- You can tell me. It's okay.

1:04:09.011 --> 1:04:13.508
- Well, the truth is--is,
um, well, it's been hard

1:04:13.543 --> 1:04:14.883
working at the library.

1:04:14.918 --> 1:04:17.182
It's just--it's so quiet.
I get--I get so lonely.

1:04:17.217 --> 1:04:18.183
Yeah.
- Well, that makes sense.

1:04:18.218 --> 1:04:19.646
I can understand that.

1:04:19.681 --> 1:04:20.922
I'm just so glad
that your good work ethic

1:04:20.957 --> 1:04:22.418
is rubbing off on Dave.

1:04:22.453 --> 1:04:24.024
Because, as I always say,

1:04:24.059 --> 1:04:27.423
"Friends: Great to have them
to rely on."

1:04:27.458 --> 1:04:29.062
- I--I sure hope so, sir.

1:04:29.097 --> 1:04:30.855
- Well, I am anxious
to catch a glimpse

1:04:30.890 --> 1:04:33.561
of lifeguard Dave in action!

1:04:33.596 --> 1:04:35.596
So, I will catch you around?

1:04:35.631 --> 1:04:37.004
- Okay.

1:04:37.039 --> 1:04:38.566
- Have you ever seen
my cannonball?

1:04:38.601 --> 1:04:39.908
You're in for a treat.

1:05:17.904 --> 1:05:20.575
You have got
a pretty crack team here.

1:05:20.610 --> 1:05:21.950
Oh, we get
the job done.

1:05:24.284 --> 1:05:26.416
- That's my son over there.

1:05:26.451 --> 1:05:27.582
Cool.

1:05:30.488 --> 1:05:32.917
- I lost my goggles.

1:05:32.952 --> 1:05:34.853
- Good. Go over there, okay?

1:05:38.034 --> 1:05:41.464
- You'll uh keep an eye
on him for me, won't you?

1:05:41.499 --> 1:05:43.037
- Not a strong swimmer
or something?

1:05:45.272 --> 1:05:47.041
- Well, you would know
better than me.

1:05:48.044 --> 1:05:49.505
- Oh, he's a regular?

1:05:49.540 --> 1:05:50.979
- Well, you know,
I'm his father,

1:05:51.014 --> 1:05:53.905
so I wouldn't call him
just regular.

1:05:53.940 --> 1:05:55.742
But this is his first summer
working on his own,

1:05:55.777 --> 1:05:57.810
and I'm sure he's like
a lot of other teenagers

1:05:57.845 --> 1:05:58.943
who are taking on
responsibility--

1:05:58.978 --> 1:06:00.318
No splashing.

1:06:00.353 --> 1:06:02.353
- Oh, splashing.
Yeah. There you go.

1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:05.587
Eyes like a hawk.

1:06:05.622 --> 1:06:07.886
- You just--just
gotta move away.

1:06:10.231 --> 1:06:12.693
Yeah.
But working with guys like you,

1:06:12.728 --> 1:06:14.530
I'm hoping he picks up
on some of that.

1:06:16.501 --> 1:06:17.929
Ya know

1:06:17.964 --> 1:06:18.974
discipline stuff.

1:06:22.078 --> 1:06:23.044
- Wait a minute

1:06:24.905 --> 1:06:26.344
Working with guys like me?

1:06:28.051 --> 1:06:30.084
- Well, uh, yeah.

1:06:31.582 --> 1:06:34.022
- Which one did you say
your son was?

1:06:34.057 --> 1:06:35.155
- Well, he's, uh--

1:06:36.521 --> 1:06:37.850
- That's lightning!

1:06:38.985 --> 1:06:39.885
Let's go, folks. Let's go.

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:41.722
Out of the pool.
Out of the pool.

1:06:41.757 --> 1:06:43.196
Let's go, folks. Let's go!

1:06:43.231 --> 1:06:44.989
-Come
on. I'm saving you.

1:06:45.024 --> 1:06:46.397
Sorry about your goggles.

1:06:57.344 --> 1:06:58.310
Whoo.

1:06:58.345 --> 1:07:00.004
- Yeah. That was close.

1:07:00.039 --> 1:07:01.379
Where have you been?

1:07:01.414 --> 1:07:02.875
If it wasn't for that lightning,
I would've been toast!

1:07:10.423 --> 1:07:11.983
You're a genius.

1:07:13.294 --> 1:07:15.261
Where's Hannah?

1:07:15.296 --> 1:07:18.066
- Uh, I don't know.

1:07:27.539 --> 1:07:30.243
- Hey!
Pretty cool plan, right?

1:07:30.278 --> 1:07:31.937
I can't believe it worked.

1:07:31.972 --> 1:07:33.279
- I can't believe
you made me do that.

1:07:33.314 --> 1:07:35.743
I had to lie to your dad.
Straight to his face.

1:07:35.778 --> 1:07:37.745
- I made you do that?

1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:38.845
It was Curtis's idea.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.088
- Look, I don't lie, Dave!

1:07:40.123 --> 1:07:41.254
All right, and your stupid plan

1:07:41.289 --> 1:07:43.223
it's making me act like
someone I'm not!

1:07:43.258 --> 1:07:45.951
- Whoa, slow down. My plan?

1:07:45.986 --> 1:07:48.019
Who's the genius who came up
with Project Pay Day

1:07:48.054 --> 1:07:49.526
in the first place?

1:07:49.561 --> 1:07:51.132
'Cause if there's anyone you
should be yelling at, it's him!

1:07:52.993 --> 1:07:54.597
Yeah, Hannah.

1:07:54.632 --> 1:07:55.664
Why don't you yell at him?

1:07:58.097 --> 1:07:59.701
- Look, Curtis, I'm done.

1:07:59.736 --> 1:08:01.065
All right?
I'm just gonna get a job.

1:08:01.100 --> 1:08:02.737
It's what I should've done
from the beginning.

1:08:02.772 --> 1:08:04.035
I won't turn you guys in.

1:08:04.070 --> 1:08:06.345
But if anyone asks,
I won't lie for you again.

1:08:08.910 --> 1:08:10.382
You know what? I trusted you.

1:08:10.417 --> 1:08:11.845
And you took advantage of that.

1:08:17.787 --> 1:08:19.127
- Dude.

1:08:19.162 --> 1:08:21.756
- So this is all my fault?
You actually think that?

1:08:21.791 --> 1:08:23.164
- Yeah. You made her lie.

1:08:23.199 --> 1:08:24.924
- Yeah. For you, Dave.

1:08:24.959 --> 1:08:26.761
Because your dad
was about to find you out.

1:08:26.796 --> 1:08:28.059
- That's not my fault!

1:08:28.094 --> 1:08:29.236
You're the only reason
there's something to be

1:08:29.271 --> 1:08:30.930
found out in the first place!

1:08:30.965 --> 1:08:33.504
- Why can't you take
any responsibility here?

1:08:33.539 --> 1:08:35.066
Why does it have to all be me?

1:09:17.814 --> 1:09:19.781
- There's my big man! I was
looking for you at the pool.

1:09:19.816 --> 1:09:21.948
I was gonna drive you
for some ice cream!

1:09:21.983 --> 1:09:25.391
But looks like the ice cream
just drove to you!

1:09:25.426 --> 1:09:27.360
- Thanks, I'm not hungry.

1:09:27.395 --> 1:09:29.725
- What? Really?

1:09:31.025 --> 1:09:33.993
Okay. Well, I guess
it's two for me then.

1:09:38.274 --> 1:09:40.736
You know what, son?

1:09:40.771 --> 1:09:42.474
I'm proud of you.

1:09:42.509 --> 1:09:44.245
Seeing you at the pool.

1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:48.480
All those people putting
their lives in your hands.

1:09:48.515 --> 1:09:50.218
It's a hell of lot of
responsibility.

1:09:50.253 --> 1:09:52.484
And you're taking
good care of 'em.

1:09:52.519 --> 1:09:53.881
I really admire that.

1:09:55.016 --> 1:09:56.521
You're doing good work.

1:09:57.524 --> 1:09:58.523
What if I'm not?

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:02.989
What if I've never
taken any responsibility

1:10:03.024 --> 1:10:06.058
for anything in my entire life?

1:10:06.093 --> 1:10:09.567
What if I told you
that I'm not a

1:10:09.602 --> 1:10:11.767
who you think I am.

1:10:11.802 --> 1:10:14.770
That I'm not doing
what you think I'm doing.

1:10:18.479 --> 1:10:21.513
- Okay. You listen to me.
All right?

1:10:21.548 --> 1:10:23.042
I'm gonna say this once.

1:10:25.750 --> 1:10:27.552
It doesn't matter
what you've done,

1:10:27.587 --> 1:10:30.885
or what you haven't done

1:10:30.920 --> 1:10:33.217
I will always love you.

1:10:33.252 --> 1:10:34.559
Okay?

1:10:34.594 --> 1:10:36.462
Now, your mother,
on the other hand

1:10:38.158 --> 1:10:40.268
No, I'm kidding, seriously.

1:10:40.303 --> 1:10:42.633
You know, everybody
makes mistakes.

1:10:42.668 --> 1:10:43.766
Some people lie.

1:10:43.801 --> 1:10:46.065
Some people get away with it.

1:10:46.100 --> 1:10:48.639
And other people don't want to.

1:10:48.674 --> 1:10:50.608
Those people,
they own their mistakes,

1:10:50.643 --> 1:10:53.908
and they take responsibility,
and they make them right.

1:10:53.943 --> 1:10:56.108
You just remember that.

1:10:56.143 --> 1:10:58.913
What has happened in the past
isn't nearly as important

1:10:58.948 --> 1:11:00.112
as what you do next.

1:11:01.181 --> 1:11:02.983
What a load of crap!

1:11:06.186 --> 1:11:07.922
More shoplifting!

1:11:07.957 --> 1:11:10.155
This guy is lifting stuff
left and right,

1:11:10.190 --> 1:11:12.333
and ruining the reputation
of the mall.

1:11:12.368 --> 1:11:14.830
And no one's doing
anything serious about it!

1:11:14.865 --> 1:11:17.162
They put up a reward!

1:11:17.197 --> 1:11:18.636
A reward!

1:11:18.671 --> 1:11:20.231
Isn't that the silliest thing
you have ever heard?

1:11:20.266 --> 1:11:22.772
As if 5,000 dollars
is going to convince

1:11:22.807 --> 1:11:26.204
some random vigilante
to track this guy down.

1:11:27.779 --> 1:11:30.582
Oh, I just wish that someone
would take some responsibility

1:11:30.617 --> 1:11:32.617
and belly up
and resolve this thing!

1:11:35.215 --> 1:11:36.390
Anyway, how was the pool?

1:11:53.739 --> 1:11:54.870
Hey.

1:11:56.379 --> 1:11:57.972
Thought
you weren't coming.

1:11:58.007 --> 1:11:59.138
Is Hannah here?

1:12:03.078 --> 1:12:05.012
- Nah, thought she was with you.

1:12:06.488 --> 1:12:09.049
- Curtis, I don't think
we're gonna find anything here.

1:12:09.084 --> 1:12:12.019
I think the best thing to do
is to stop and--

1:12:12.054 --> 1:12:13.086
- BOOM.

1:12:14.892 --> 1:12:15.990
- Uh

1:12:16.025 --> 1:12:18.058
- Found him this morning.

1:12:18.093 --> 1:12:19.961
- But don't

1:12:19.996 --> 1:12:22.370
we have--
- That isn't Mr. Moneybags.

1:12:22.405 --> 1:12:24.196
It's one exactly like him
that I found

1:12:24.231 --> 1:12:26.539
right at the bottom
right over there.

1:12:26.574 --> 1:12:28.739
So, don't say we're not
gonna find anything.

1:12:28.774 --> 1:12:31.071
- Curtis, Uncle Brad gets home
the day after tomorrow!

1:12:31.106 --> 1:12:33.546
And you finding one thing
in two weeks just doesn't help.

1:12:37.882 --> 1:12:41.312
I came here to apologize.

1:12:41.347 --> 1:12:43.215
I know you've been doing
all this for me.

1:12:43.250 --> 1:12:44.854
And for us.

1:12:44.889 --> 1:12:47.087
I just don't understand
why we're fighting

1:12:47.122 --> 1:12:48.429
if the whole point
was to be together.

1:12:51.093 --> 1:12:53.225
It's my fault
I'm in this situation,

1:12:53.260 --> 1:12:56.767
and I'm probably gonna
have to come clean to my mom

1:12:56.802 --> 1:12:58.901
and live out the rest
of my days in probation.

1:13:01.268 --> 1:13:04.940
I do have one last idea, though.

1:13:04.975 --> 1:13:07.877
The mall my mom works
at. There's a shoplifter.

1:13:07.912 --> 1:13:10.110
He's been stealing
antiques and stuff.

1:13:10.145 --> 1:13:12.046
- So?

1:13:12.081 --> 1:13:13.883
- So, there's a reward.

1:13:13.918 --> 1:13:15.852
For 5,000 dollars.

1:13:15.887 --> 1:13:17.854
- Why didn't you say so?

1:13:17.889 --> 1:13:19.691
- Because it's really risky.

1:13:19.726 --> 1:13:21.187
My mom's gonna be
all over that place.

1:13:21.222 --> 1:13:23.959
And the odds of us running
into her before the shoplifter

1:13:23.994 --> 1:13:27.468
and if we do,
I'm gonna come clean.

1:13:27.503 --> 1:13:28.601
- I'm in.

1:13:30.429 --> 1:13:31.868
Sorry, little guy.

1:13:31.903 --> 1:13:34.068
You know, these things are
much heavier than they look.

1:13:36.105 --> 1:13:36.939
Friends?

1:13:39.075 --> 1:13:40.074
For life.

1:13:41.814 --> 1:13:45.277
And besides, last-ditch efforts
are always the ones that work.

1:13:45.312 --> 1:13:46.751
- Yeah.

1:13:46.786 --> 1:13:48.379
I don't know why they always
save them till last.

1:14:10.810 --> 1:14:13.074
- So do we stake out,
or search and destroy?

1:14:13.109 --> 1:14:14.944
- Well, search and destroy
makes it harder to avoid my mom

1:14:14.979 --> 1:14:17.617
but we gotta go for it.

1:14:17.652 --> 1:14:18.816
- All right.

1:15:07.196 --> 1:15:08.536
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:15:08.571 --> 1:15:12.166
I cute kid.
-

1:15:20.110 --> 1:15:23.078
Drifting by

1:15:33.123 --> 1:15:36.124
Out in the sun

1:15:44.134 --> 1:15:46.706
- What does a shoplifter
even look like anyway?

1:15:46.741 --> 1:15:47.905
- I don't know.

1:15:47.940 --> 1:15:49.610
But it looks like
Project Pay Day

1:15:49.645 --> 1:15:52.074
hasn't really paid off, has it?

1:15:52.109 --> 1:15:54.241
Dave?

1:15:54.276 --> 1:15:55.374
- It looks that way now.

1:15:55.409 --> 1:15:56.848
- Why aren't you at the pool?

1:15:56.883 --> 1:16:01.919
- Mom. Ah, ah, Mother, I--

1:16:02.416 --> 1:16:03.052
- Dave, wait.

1:16:03.087 --> 1:16:04.251
- No.

1:16:04.286 --> 1:16:06.121
Look, I made a mistake,
and you need to know.

1:16:06.156 --> 1:16:08.926
But Curtis and Hannah
had nothing to do with it.

1:16:08.961 --> 1:16:11.764
Dave. Explain yourself.

1:16:11.799 --> 1:16:13.524
- Okay, so the truth is--

1:16:13.559 --> 1:16:16.802
- The truth is,
Dave is a great guy,

1:16:16.837 --> 1:16:18.606
and the best friend
I could ever ask for.

1:16:18.641 --> 1:16:21.499
And if he trusts me at all,
he'll follow my lead.

1:16:23.811 --> 1:16:26.009
- Um, be right back.

1:16:28.310 --> 1:16:29.848
- What are you doing?

1:16:40.696 --> 1:16:42.663
- Okay. I trust you.
But what are we doing?

1:16:42.698 --> 1:16:44.291
- I think I found
the shoplifter.

1:16:44.326 --> 1:16:45.292
Follow me.

1:17:11.958 --> 1:17:14.156
Not only have I seen him
hanging around the mall,

1:17:14.191 --> 1:17:16.422
but he's the same guy
who tried to take Mr. Moneybags.

1:17:16.457 --> 1:17:18.292
No way!
- Yeah. Stay close.

1:17:38.985 --> 1:17:40.688
- Now what?
Should we call the police?

1:17:40.723 --> 1:17:43.350
- No. We need hard evidence!

1:17:43.385 --> 1:17:45.022
We wait till he leaves,

1:17:45.057 --> 1:17:46.320
grab the stolen goods
from his apartment,

1:17:46.355 --> 1:17:48.124
and get out of there!

1:17:48.159 --> 1:17:49.862
You sure about this?

1:17:49.897 --> 1:17:51.193
- Gotta be.

1:18:45.315 --> 1:18:46.919
- It's locked.

1:18:46.954 --> 1:18:48.118
Why didn't we expect this?

1:18:48.153 --> 1:18:49.757
- Who didn't expect it?

1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:12.978
- Does this guy have a fake leg?

1:19:14.850 --> 1:19:16.641
- Maybe that's how
he gets the goods out.

1:19:23.122 --> 1:19:24.484
This place is disgusting.

1:19:35.794 --> 1:19:37.970
- Hey isn't this the book
that Hannah has?

1:19:39.171 --> 1:19:40.973
- Yeah, I think so.
-

1:19:42.977 --> 1:19:44.273
- Ah. In there!

1:19:59.026 --> 1:20:01.422
You think we can
make it to the door?

1:20:01.457 --> 1:20:05.030
- We should grab something to
connect him to the thefts first.

1:20:05.065 --> 1:20:06.559
- I think we're beyond that.

1:20:19.178 --> 1:20:20.573
- It's Hannah.
- Just turn it off.

1:20:29.089 --> 1:20:30.682
- You!
-  Run!

1:20:50.176 --> 1:20:52.539
- It's Hannah again!

1:20:52.574 --> 1:20:54.046
What?!

1:20:54.081 --> 1:20:56.048
What?
Hannah, we're in trouble.

1:20:56.083 --> 1:20:57.676
- I know where the coins are.

1:20:57.711 --> 1:20:58.985
She knows
where the coins are.

1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:00.382
- Where is she?
- Hannah, where are you?

1:21:01.451 --> 1:21:03.088
Okay, we'll meet you there.

1:21:03.123 --> 1:21:04.089
Chinatown Tunnels.

1:21:04.124 --> 1:21:05.255
- Good a place as any to hide!

1:21:14.794 --> 1:21:16.398
He's got a gun!
-  That is not cool.

1:21:18.105 --> 1:21:19.104
Hannah. Hannah.

1:21:21.141 --> 1:21:22.404
Hannah.

1:21:32.086 --> 1:21:33.679
Guys?

1:21:33.714 --> 1:21:34.922
Curtis?

1:21:34.957 --> 1:21:37.320
Dave? Is that you?
I know where the coins are.

1:21:38.554 --> 1:21:40.092
Guys, where are you?

1:21:40.928 --> 1:21:42.259
Where are
your friends?

1:21:42.294 --> 1:21:43.293
- I don't know.

1:21:44.296 --> 1:21:45.295
What do we do?

1:21:46.727 --> 1:21:48.199
- I don't know.

1:21:48.234 --> 1:21:50.102
What were those
coins you were talking about?

1:21:50.137 --> 1:21:52.203
- Please, I'm just lost.
I don't know.

1:21:52.238 --> 1:21:54.271
- Where's that figurine
you had? That cat.

1:21:59.938 --> 1:22:01.212
- Here.
This is what he wants.

1:22:01.247 --> 1:22:02.774
It must be worth something.

1:22:02.809 --> 1:22:04.116
- Why are you giving it to me?

1:22:05.449 --> 1:22:06.448
- For luck.

1:22:09.123 --> 1:22:10.320
Curtis!
- You.

1:22:10.355 --> 1:22:13.158
- Listen! I'm the one
you want, right?

1:22:13.193 --> 1:22:15.292
- All right, boy.
Where's that figurine?

1:22:15.327 --> 1:22:16.920
You know, that fat cat.

1:22:16.955 --> 1:22:18.933
Come on. Give me the figurine
and then we can talk.

1:22:21.201 --> 1:22:22.937
You want it? You got
it. -

1:22:26.932 --> 1:22:27.898
- Oh, I think for once
in your life,

1:22:27.933 --> 1:22:29.504
you actually got me
out of trouble.

1:22:36.051 --> 1:22:38.018
- Why would you break that
if it was worth so much?

1:22:38.053 --> 1:22:39.415
- Because

1:22:39.450 --> 1:22:42.616
what matters
is on the inside.

1:22:42.651 --> 1:22:44.090
- So, you writing
bad poetry now?

1:22:44.125 --> 1:22:45.190
- You figured it out, too.

1:22:47.194 --> 1:22:48.523
- Just in time.

1:22:48.558 --> 1:22:51.163
- The Labash coins?
Inside Mr. Moneybags?

1:22:51.198 --> 1:22:53.000
- They've been there all along.

1:22:53.035 --> 1:22:56.168
That's where
Councilman Haft hid the coins.

1:22:56.203 --> 1:22:57.862
He did steal the coins.

1:22:57.897 --> 1:23:00.040
And he did use
the Chinatown Tunnels.

1:23:00.075 --> 1:23:02.603
But that's not where
he decided to hide the coins.

1:23:02.638 --> 1:23:05.672
He decided to hide the coins
right in plain sight

1:23:05.707 --> 1:23:07.179
inside a statue

1:23:07.214 --> 1:23:09.643
that everyone would
always remember him having.

1:23:11.812 --> 1:23:14.021
He put the new statue,
the one with the gold coins,

1:23:14.056 --> 1:23:15.550
where the original had been.

1:23:15.585 --> 1:23:17.618
So, when the police
came to search his office,

1:23:17.653 --> 1:23:19.983
they didn't find anything.

1:23:20.018 --> 1:23:23.624
- So, all that business about
Lei-Lei stealing the coins?

1:23:23.659 --> 1:23:24.988
That was just a red herring?

1:23:25.023 --> 1:23:26.330
Not quite.

1:23:26.365 --> 1:23:28.134
It seems that part of
the story was embellished.

1:23:28.169 --> 1:23:31.071
But without it,
we wouldn't have searched

1:23:31.106 --> 1:23:32.996
- In the bay!

1:23:33.031 --> 1:23:34.041
- What?

1:23:38.410 --> 1:23:40.003
That's what
I figured.

1:23:40.038 --> 1:23:41.675
That Haft must have disposed
of the original Mr. Moneybags

1:23:41.710 --> 1:23:43.314
from the tunnels.

1:23:43.349 --> 1:23:44.843
What?

1:23:44.878 --> 1:23:46.548
That's where you
found the original

1:23:46.583 --> 1:23:47.747
statue in the water.

1:23:47.782 --> 1:23:49.419
Haft needed to get rid
of the original,

1:23:49.454 --> 1:23:51.058
so no one would
suspect the duplicate.

1:23:51.093 --> 1:23:53.225
So, he found this exit.

1:23:53.260 --> 1:23:55.821
And threw the old statue
into the bay.

1:23:55.856 --> 1:23:57.020
-So
you found the original?

1:23:57.055 --> 1:23:58.857
I was right.

1:23:58.892 --> 1:24:00.529
- We did it.

1:24:00.564 --> 1:24:01.827
What the--!

1:24:01.862 --> 1:24:02.894
- The gold!

1:24:05.272 --> 1:24:07.932
So is this guy dead
or unconscious or what?

1:24:07.967 --> 1:24:12.970
If he rolls higher
than a 15, he can regenerate.

1:24:14.545 --> 1:24:16.039
- Hey!

1:24:16.074 --> 1:24:17.084
- You again?

1:24:17.119 --> 1:24:19.086
- You cosplayers
need a new quest?

1:24:19.121 --> 1:24:20.582
LARPers.

1:24:20.617 --> 1:24:22.089
- What did you have in mind?

1:24:22.124 --> 1:24:24.619
- Well, there's a reward
for this guy's capture.

1:24:24.654 --> 1:24:28.359
Five thousand dolla
5,000 gold pieces.

1:24:28.394 --> 1:24:29.723
You guys up for the challenge?

1:24:31.166 --> 1:24:33.023
- A really real reward?

1:24:33.058 --> 1:24:35.058
Why don't
you want it?

1:24:35.093 --> 1:24:36.103
- Well

1:24:38.734 --> 1:24:41.075
we have our own quest to finish.

1:24:55.355 --> 1:24:56.882
- Okay. Here's what we can say.

1:24:56.917 --> 1:24:58.488
- No. I'm not lying anymore.

1:24:58.523 --> 1:24:59.918
- Curtis, I'm supposed
to be coming clean.

1:24:59.953 --> 1:25:01.590
She already saw us at the mall.

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:02.987
- We're right behind you, Dave.

1:25:03.022 --> 1:25:04.956
- Who's we, hot stuff?

1:25:04.991 --> 1:25:06.265
I'm in this for the gold,

1:25:06.300 --> 1:25:08.498
not to see your mom
take your head off.

1:25:10.535 --> 1:25:11.831
- Mom? Dad ?

1:25:11.866 --> 1:25:13.096
- Shhh!

1:25:13.131 --> 1:25:13.833
You don't have to.

1:25:13.868 --> 1:25:17.342
- Dave? What's going on?

1:25:17.377 --> 1:25:19.003
You need to explain yourself.

1:25:19.038 --> 1:25:20.906
- Guys, I have something
to tell you.

1:25:20.941 --> 1:25:24.415
I don't have a summer job.
I don't work at the pool.

1:25:24.450 --> 1:25:26.417
I've been lying to you
all summer.

1:25:26.452 --> 1:25:27.748
Dad, you were right.

1:25:27.783 --> 1:25:29.783
If I can't take
the responsibility to get a job,

1:25:29.818 --> 1:25:31.081
I should at least
take the responsibility

1:25:31.116 --> 1:25:32.588
about lying to you guys.

1:25:32.623 --> 1:25:34.854
I'm really sorry.
And I shouldn't have done it.

1:25:34.889 --> 1:25:36.922
- Well, I, uh
I guess I'm glad

1:25:36.957 --> 1:25:40.090
that you're being honest now.

1:25:40.125 --> 1:25:41.465
- We are livid.

1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:42.697
Do you think
I'm going to tell you

1:25:42.732 --> 1:25:44.303
it's all okay
just because you ?

1:25:44.338 --> 1:25:47.933
- No! And I've also learned that
some mistakes take time to fix,

1:25:47.968 --> 1:25:50.100
and with hard work.

1:25:50.135 --> 1:25:52.872
So I'm willing to accept
whatever punishment you see fit,

1:25:52.907 --> 1:25:54.874
and I will also work
as your assistant

1:25:54.909 --> 1:25:56.007
until I earn enough money

1:25:56.042 --> 1:25:57.811
to pay for my
back-to-school supplies

1:25:57.846 --> 1:26:00.044
or college fund or
whatever.

1:26:00.079 --> 1:26:01.980
Just like we agreed.

1:26:02.015 --> 1:26:03.487
- Well, I

1:26:03.522 --> 1:26:04.950
- And I know that you wanted me
to take some responsibility

1:26:04.985 --> 1:26:08.118
and work hard this summer,
but I just needed some help

1:26:08.153 --> 1:26:11.231
figuring out the things
that were worth working for.

1:26:11.266 --> 1:26:12.859
- That's why you have friends.

1:26:14.159 --> 1:26:15.631
- Well, friends

1:26:15.666 --> 1:26:18.205
- Great to have them to rely on.

1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:19.503
- Guys, I guess
I'm not going to be able to

1:26:19.538 --> 1:26:20.702
see you around for a while.

1:26:20.737 --> 1:26:21.868
Oh, stop!

1:26:23.509 --> 1:26:26.873
Dave, you know we love you
more than anything.

1:26:26.908 --> 1:26:30.646
And your honesty,
it means everything to us.

1:26:30.681 --> 1:26:34.078
This is very grown-up of you.

1:26:34.113 --> 1:26:36.421
- Yeah, and I don't
want to rush that,

1:26:36.456 --> 1:26:38.258
but, while I'm being honest,

1:26:38.293 --> 1:26:42.295
there's probably something else
that we should tell you about.

1:26:47.566 --> 1:26:50.534
So my mom's just making me
work nights with her

1:26:50.569 --> 1:26:52.536
for the first two months
of school.

1:26:52.571 --> 1:26:55.902
- Could've been worse!
For both of us.

1:26:55.937 --> 1:26:58.003
- So why didn't you
just keep the coins?

1:26:58.038 --> 1:27:00.170
- Well, we figured they belong
to you more than anyone!

1:27:00.205 --> 1:27:01.842
Your family's story
is the whole reason

1:27:01.877 --> 1:27:03.349
we found them
in the first place.

1:27:03.384 --> 1:27:04.713
Plus, they're an important part

1:27:04.748 --> 1:27:06.451
of the local
Chinese immigrant history.

1:27:06.486 --> 1:27:09.113
- That's why I donated them to
the Chinese History Museum.

1:27:09.148 --> 1:27:10.917
They should have been there
a long time ago.

1:27:10.952 --> 1:27:12.358
- And money isn't everything.

1:27:12.393 --> 1:27:14.756
There are more important
things in life.

1:27:17.090 --> 1:27:20.267
- Truer words, Dave.
Truer words.

1:27:21.963 --> 1:27:23.963
- Although
a debt is a debt.

1:27:23.998 --> 1:27:25.701
And since the insurance
finally came through

1:27:25.736 --> 1:27:27.065
on my windshield repair

1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:29.936
I think I owe you about
5,000 dollars.

1:27:31.907 --> 1:27:33.247
Plus interest, of course.

1:27:34.778 --> 1:27:37.581
Consider it a 'thank you'
for all you guys have done.

1:27:37.616 --> 1:27:39.418
- It was nothing.

1:28:14.015 --> 1:28:15.421
- The old adage is true.

1:28:15.456 --> 1:28:17.115
Most opportunities are missed

1:28:17.150 --> 1:28:19.623
because they go around
looking like hard work.

1:28:19.658 --> 1:28:22.626
And remember,
what you focus on becomes--

1:28:50.491 --> 1:28:52.018
- Good morning,
and welcome back.

1:28:52.053 --> 1:28:54.823
Today, we're gonna start with
an old school assignment.

1:28:54.858 --> 1:28:57.155
An essay of what you did
last summer.

1:28:57.190 --> 1:28:59.322
Hopefully,
it's gonna be more interesting

1:28:59.357 --> 1:29:01.665
than just playing video games.

1:29:08.839 --> 1:29:13.336
Talk about forever

1:29:18.112 --> 1:29:22.983
Until I can't breathe

1:29:25.185 --> 1:29:30.188
All the whole night through

1:29:34.799 --> 1:29:39.802
The distant tumbling stars

1:29:46.404 --> 1:29:49.174
That it's your first kiss

1:29:58.086 --> 1:30:02.924
Grow uuuup

1:30:10.604 --> 1:30:12.769
And scream

1:30:24.948 --> 1:30:26.981
Have ever seen

1:30:45.034 --> 1:30:49.135
I don't wanna grow up
