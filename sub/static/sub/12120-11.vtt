WEBVTT

01:36.300 --> 01:38.140
If you're a ghost, I'm a friend.

01:38.220 --> 01:41.140
-What if I'm Babe?
-Oh, Babe!

01:41.220 --> 01:43.350
-Ah!
-Oh, my God.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.770
-I didn't know you were back.
-I'm back.

01:45.850 --> 01:48.230
And look! I've got a new wagon.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.650
-What's in it?
-Just a little spring cleaning.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.360
I saw your fire ceremony
from my bedroom window

01:53.440 --> 01:54.690
and I wanted to get in on it.

01:54.780 --> 01:59.820
Oh, Babe, I was cleansing myself
of an ugly corporate chapter of my life.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.410
Aww.

02:01.490 --> 02:03.080
But I don't want to talk about me.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.620
I want to talk about you.
I want to hear all about your travels.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.419
Same old, same old. The Great Wall,
the Berlin Wall, the Wailing Wall.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.750
The whole world is just a bunch of walls.
Now, come on, catch me up.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.550
Let's see.

02:16.630 --> 02:20.050
Robert and Sol told us they were lovers,
so I moved in here with Grace.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.430
Sol and Robert got married,
now they're getting divorced

02:22.510 --> 02:25.640
because Sol was unfaithful
with a woman who turned out to be me.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.560
And I almost made nine million dollars.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.400
You and Grace are living together?

02:47.410 --> 02:50.080
I wasn't really expecting today
to go like this.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.210
But I'm so glad it did.

02:54.290 --> 02:56.130
Me, too.

02:59.050 --> 03:02.890
So... how do we do this exactly?

03:02.970 --> 03:05.720
I think we've reached that point
in the evening

03:05.810 --> 03:07.680
where you ask me
if I'd like to come in.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.140
-Do you want to come in?
-I do.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.730
But I don't want you
to think I'm easy.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.520
Believe me, I know you're not easy.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.740
Ah!

03:18.820 --> 03:20.030
What's so funny?

03:20.110 --> 03:22.610
Oh, I'm just trying
to picture you two down here

03:22.700 --> 03:25.030
hanging over waffles
in the morning.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.330
-It's been a process.
-Oh, I thought you hated Grace.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.210
Hate's such a strong word.

03:32.290 --> 03:36.500
It's the word you used when
you said things like, "I hate Grace."

03:36.590 --> 03:39.510
Thank God I could vent about her
on our walks.

03:39.590 --> 03:42.180
You know,
she vented about you, too, sunshine.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.680
-When?
-On my walks I took with her

03:44.760 --> 03:47.010
right after the walks I took with you.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.350
-You did a lot of walking.
-I did.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.770
-My ass looked good then.
-Your ass looks good now.

03:55.730 --> 03:59.530
So, how's Grace been managing
with all this drama?

03:59.610 --> 04:02.450
Like a champ. With my help, of course.

04:02.530 --> 04:05.700
And you know, like,
how she was always a skinny,

04:05.780 --> 04:07.830
emotionally shut down drill sergeant?

04:07.910 --> 04:12.620
Now she's a skinny, not so
emotionally shut down drill sergeant.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.210
Where is she?
I want to give her a squeeze.

04:15.290 --> 04:19.300
Upstairs sleeping. She's going through
a lot of rough stuff right now.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.920
I'm sure she'll tell you,
but it's very private,

04:22.010 --> 04:23.970
so it's not for me to say.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.770
She reconnected with this guy
that she'd been in love with for years

04:29.850 --> 04:30.970
and it didn't work out.

04:31.060 --> 04:33.770
He has a sick wife.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.020
I'm sure she'll tell you.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.190
If only her neighbor
were throwing a party,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.110
maybe that'd cheer her up.

04:42.190 --> 04:44.780
-A Babe party?
-The Babe party.

04:44.860 --> 04:47.530
It's gonna be the party
to end all parties.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.740
I don't know how it could
beat the last one.

04:49.830 --> 04:51.750
It went on for 24 hours.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.120
Are you gonna have that little monkey
that picks pockets?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.420
Oh, no. I'm done with her owner.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.750
He doesn't think Patton Oswalt's funny.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.590
Fuck that noise.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.100
Turns out you are easy.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.980
God, I've missed you.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.570
I had some moments of missing you, too.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.450
But I played it pretty close to the vest.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.620
Feels good holding you again.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.580
I thought you were holding me
so I didn't drop to the floor.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.170
Sorry the bed's so small.

05:39.250 --> 05:43.130
Don't be. It was the best night's sleep
I've had in weeks.

05:44.090 --> 05:46.930
Me, too.

05:49.970 --> 05:53.520
This place is way worse in the daylight.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.310
Fortunately,
it never gets brighter than this.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.320
Why would you move in here
in the first place?

06:03.320 --> 06:04.690
I don't know.

06:05.610 --> 06:08.280
I guess after what I did to you...

06:10.030 --> 06:12.410
it's what I thought I deserved.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.040
I will never again doubt how bad you felt.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.500
And I'm sorry.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.300
Oh, good morning.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.390
Try again.

06:30.470 --> 06:31.640
Bad morning?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.470
Can I get you something?

06:36.430 --> 06:39.480
A larger sphere of personal space.

06:40.270 --> 06:41.350
It's the one thing I'm out of.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.730
Then, no.

06:42.810 --> 06:45.360
OK, here's what we need to do.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.360
We're gonna start Frankie Bergstein's
three-step emotional healing system,

06:50.450 --> 06:52.870
-patent pending.
-No.

06:52.950 --> 06:56.490
Step one: talk about it.
You need to purge.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.000
-It's essential for closure.
-No.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.920
And I've got watermelon.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.460
It's everyone's favorite low-calorie food.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.550
Basically celery
in a Lilly Pulitzer dress.

07:07.630 --> 07:10.630
Can we move on to step two
so I can say no to that?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.760
Step two: art therapy.

07:12.840 --> 07:16.100
-No.
-I soaked you an extra lump of clay.

07:16.180 --> 07:18.560
I just want to get into my bed...

07:19.560 --> 07:23.770
and watch that show
where terrible people buy tiny houses.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.980
All right. But I want you to know
I'm proud of you.

07:27.070 --> 07:29.950
I know it was hard to say no to Phil...

07:31.110 --> 07:34.950
but it's so much better that
you stopped it before it started.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.200
Yeah, well--

07:36.280 --> 07:38.750
No, I'm not gonna let you
put a negative spin on this.

07:38.830 --> 07:40.910
You are my shero.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.460
-Please don't tell me why.
-I'll tell you why.

07:43.540 --> 07:46.130
You were strong
when you made a clean break.

07:46.210 --> 07:49.760
You weren't weak like I was
when I slept with Sol.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.350
Why are you defiling my watermelon?

07:57.430 --> 07:59.810
Because they don't sell them like this.

07:59.890 --> 08:03.190
Isn't it a little early
for that watermelon to be drunk?

08:03.270 --> 08:05.610
I'm talking about you, Grace.
You're the watermelon.

08:05.690 --> 08:08.650
I'm not having it now.
It has to marinate.

08:09.570 --> 08:11.190
I'm cooking.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.110
You know, you should share that with Babe.
She's back.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.280
She is?

08:16.070 --> 08:18.830
Oh, God, I'd love to see her,
but not right now.

08:18.910 --> 08:21.410
The boys are coming today to meet Jacob.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.330
You want to join us for crafts?

08:23.420 --> 08:26.790
You talking to me or the watermelon?
'Cause the watermelon's not coming.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.500
I'm the watermelon.

08:28.590 --> 08:31.050
You want me to cancel
so I can be with you?

08:31.130 --> 08:35.640
Oh, please don't feel hurt, but I...
I need some alone time.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.760
Yes, alone time
is all part of the process.

08:38.850 --> 08:41.429
You can vlog. You can write
your feelings in the sand.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.730
You can jump in the pool
and do some underwater yelling.

08:45.810 --> 08:49.940
I think I'm just gonna take myself
for a walk on the beach.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.860
Mmm.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.820
Best martini in town. Another.

08:56.910 --> 08:59.830
If you think I'm gonna ask you why
you're drinking at 11 in the morning,

08:59.910 --> 09:01.080
you've come to the wrong bartender.

09:01.160 --> 09:05.870
That's exactly why I'm here.
No talking, just drinking.

09:08.670 --> 09:10.670
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.010
Are we really braiding garlic?

09:15.090 --> 09:17.930
I think it's Mom's idea
of a group bonding activity.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.100
Hm.

09:19.180 --> 09:20.930
Are you really packing a Dry Lady Dry?

09:21.010 --> 09:22.180
Mom asked me to pick it up.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.310
Man, I cannot believe
she is back on deodorant.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.900
Well, maybe she's just trying to
get ahead of the garlic. Frankie B!

09:32.150 --> 09:36.110
Up or down? Down or up?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.740
-What?
-My hair.

09:37.820 --> 09:39.450
Oh, down.

09:39.530 --> 09:41.490
Oh, God, I've got-- I better go fix it.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.200
Oh, you know my...

09:43.290 --> 09:45.620
- What about my dress?
- Is it like too-- Is it--

09:45.710 --> 09:48.670
I'm trying-- Am I trying too--
I mean, my hands are so sweaty.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.590
I hope you like him. I think you will.

09:50.670 --> 09:54.090
I know he's gonna like you.
He's really a great-- I'm-- I--

09:54.170 --> 09:58.220
I'm pretty sure you'll like him, too.
I-- Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.050
You can't tell, can you? Really?

10:00.140 --> 10:02.890
-Not at all.
-Whoa.

10:05.930 --> 10:10.110
Our mom is using store-bought deodorant
for a man that isn't our dad.

10:10.190 --> 10:13.980
- Or Art Garfunkel.
- She is leaning in, man.

10:14.070 --> 10:15.150
Yeah.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.490
Do you think this guy's the real deal?

10:16.570 --> 10:19.240
Well, she seems pretty sure about him.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.740
And she deserves to have somebody.
Maybe he's that someone.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.200
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.250
Or maybe he's that someone
that blows in with all the sizzle and jazz

10:26.330 --> 10:28.790
of a master garlic braider,

10:28.870 --> 10:32.130
only he's braiding
someone else's garlic on the side.

10:32.210 --> 10:34.250
-That would suck.
-Not on my watch.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.090
I'm really nervous now too.

10:41.090 --> 10:44.890
Well, hey-hey. Here he is.

10:44.970 --> 10:48.730
Hey, guys. Great to finally meet you.
Your mom talks about you two all the time.

10:49.350 --> 10:51.150
I got a few more boxes in the car.

10:51.230 --> 10:53.060
We will give you a hand.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.610
Bud...

10:55.690 --> 10:57.110
-I love him.
-You just met him.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.400
No, no, I can tell. He's solid, man.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.870
-I got great instincts.
-You have terrible instincts.

11:03.950 --> 11:05.870
-That's what you're known for.
-No--

11:11.580 --> 11:13.330
Suck on that, bitches.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.380
I think she's hustling us.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.670
-Yeah.
-You're next, Abandoned Husband.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.090
OK.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.510
I hope you're not as bad as Workers' Comp.

11:21.590 --> 11:24.100
You think he'd be better
with all that free time on his hands.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.100
Hey.

11:29.770 --> 11:34.150
Hey, you. Excuse me. How much
do you have to drink to not feel anything?

11:34.810 --> 11:38.070
If you're still asking...
you're not even close.

11:42.610 --> 11:45.780
Hello?

11:45.870 --> 11:48.540
OK, maybe you should slow down.
It's 12:15.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.040
But I'm having a good time
with my friends.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.750
Workers' Comp,
Been-Here-Since-Last-Night,

11:54.830 --> 11:58.130
-and...
-Abandoned Husband.

11:58.210 --> 12:01.510
Yeah. I love these guys.

12:01.590 --> 12:05.930
Hey, let's start a darsleague.
Darts league.

12:06.010 --> 12:09.270
A round for my darts league.

12:09.350 --> 12:10.520
We need a name.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.230
"Who Darted"?

12:16.610 --> 12:18.400
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.

12:21.110 --> 12:23.780
Hey, that's some pretty stellar braiding
you got going on.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.320
Oh, thanks.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.990
Bud, look at you.

12:27.870 --> 12:29.410
-Yeah.
-Super first attempt.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.870
Thanks, but I've actually done it before.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.250
Hey, man. Every braid is unique.

12:34.330 --> 12:35.830
I think it was Thoreau who said,

12:35.920 --> 12:40.460
"I was not designed to be forced.
I will breathe after my own fashion."

12:40.550 --> 12:43.630
-Whoa.
-Even your depths have depth.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.720
-So good.
-I have no idea what you just said.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.510
So what can you tell us about yourself,
Jacob?

12:49.600 --> 12:52.640
Well, I was born in a pretty small town
in upstate New York--

12:52.730 --> 12:54.390
Mom said you were married.
What happened there?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.230
-When and how did things go south?
-Bud.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.230
Oh, it's OK. I don't mind.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.900
My ex-wife wanted out of the marriage,

13:00.980 --> 13:03.570
but, um, it was the right thing to do
for both of us.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.950
-Was it amicable?
-Oh, yeah. We're good.

13:06.030 --> 13:08.450
She's remarried,
but we still do holidays together.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.030
On too-good-to-be-true-island?

13:10.120 --> 13:14.210
I think it's super cool
that you have a farm.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.580
Yes. How are your yields?
Do you do OK for yourself?

13:18.840 --> 13:19.840
I'm comfortable.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.960
Well, that is a relief because, uh,

13:23.050 --> 13:26.260
Mom's not as wealthy as this beach house
might lead a person to believe.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.140
How was the shower?

13:33.890 --> 13:37.560
The shower is worse than the bed.
And I would use the word "shower" loosely.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.820
It's more of a random drip.
I had to run around to get fully wet.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.980
Sorry. And don't use the hair dryer.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.940
It's downright dangerous.

13:45.030 --> 13:47.070
Unless you need to light the stove.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.620
Sit down. Breakfast is served.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.870
Doesn't this look lovely.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.200
Special K or Corn Chex?

13:55.290 --> 13:56.870
Offering a selection, are we?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.460
But of course.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.130
<i>Merci.</i>

14:00.210 --> 14:02.960
Special moment. Special K.

14:06.050 --> 14:09.470
We only have one spoon. I'll use the fork.

14:09.550 --> 14:10.550
You don't mind?

14:10.640 --> 14:14.020
It actually achieves
the perfect milk-to-cereal ratio

14:14.100 --> 14:17.390
I've been searching for my entire life.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.860
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

14:32.660 --> 14:33.990
Right on time.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.160
-Every day?
-Every day I've been here.

14:44.590 --> 14:47.050
Sir? If I may?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.950
We gotta get out of here.

15:12.030 --> 15:15.870
And quickly too. Let's go home.

15:15.950 --> 15:18.160
Boom. What else you got?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.540
Concerns about your drinking?

15:19.620 --> 15:22.500
Well, then you're in the wrong
line of work, sissy.

15:23.580 --> 15:27.380
Hey... for this next one,
surprise me.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.300
OK, I have the perfect thing.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.260
What's in there?

15:36.350 --> 15:38.310
It is a water and water with a water back.

15:38.390 --> 15:42.150
-I'm not thirsty, I just want a drink.
-You need to take a breather.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.940
-No, you're too drunk!
-I'm cutting you off.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.780
Oh, yeah?
Well, we'll just see about that.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.110
Somebody, give me a boost.

15:50.190 --> 15:51.990
-Ah...
-I knew it'd be you.

15:55.030 --> 15:58.370
Now you have to serve me.
It's the law.

15:59.450 --> 16:01.290
Ah...

16:01.370 --> 16:03.040
Hey! Hey! That is it.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.960
You guys, that is it.

16:06.040 --> 16:06.960
Get off!

16:07.040 --> 16:09.260
Hey, off! Go. I am taking you home.

16:09.340 --> 16:10.760
Where are your keys and where is your car?

16:10.840 --> 16:13.180
- At home.
- OK, fine.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.470
I'm gonna put you in a cab.

16:14.550 --> 16:18.890
No, I'm putting you in a cab.
I'm putting all of you in a cab!

16:18.970 --> 16:21.600
Why are you going all <i> Leaving Las Vegas</i>
on me right now?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.230
I mean seriously,
what is wrong with you today?

16:23.310 --> 16:26.020
I thought you were the bartender
who doesn't ask questions?

16:26.110 --> 16:30.230
Usually, yeah. That guy you just kissed?
Abandoned Husband? His name is Pete.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.900
And Been-Here-Since-Last-Night?
That is his wife.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.910
You mean Abandoned Husband is just...
Husband?

16:39.990 --> 16:43.120
Oh, God, they're all over the place.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.960
Let's leave before you do
something else you'll regret.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.460
No, I don't want to go home.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.960
They talk too much about feelings there.
I hate it.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.670
OK, you're going home. Come on.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.550
And you know what else? I lied.
You don't make the best martinis in town.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.890
Cheesecake Factory does.

16:59.350 --> 17:02.270
Are you a fan of whimsy? Answer carefully.

17:02.350 --> 17:04.060
Hey! Hey! Cashmere. Cashmere.

17:04.140 --> 17:06.230
Are you interrogating my boyfriend?

17:06.310 --> 17:08.810
No. I'm just asking a series
of pointed questions

17:08.900 --> 17:10.900
in order to get the truth.
That's different.

17:10.980 --> 17:14.359
You are supposed to build bridges
with garlic and words.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.280
Or... find out if he has
a secret love child with Cher.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.240
You have asked him that five different
times in five different ways

17:20.329 --> 17:22.040
and his answer every time is "no."

17:22.119 --> 17:25.079
That's not true. The last time his answer
was, "Why do you keep asking me that?"

17:25.160 --> 17:27.460
What is this about? Do you not like Jacob?

17:27.540 --> 17:30.960
- He seems perfectly nice.
- He is.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.510
Until he's not.

17:32.590 --> 17:36.550
Dad's the nicest guy in the world
and he broke your heart.

17:36.630 --> 17:40.100
-I mean, what's this guy gonna do?
-I don't know.

17:40.180 --> 17:43.850
Yeah. That answer terrifies me.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.520
I just-- I can't let you get hurt again.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.480
Well, I may be hurt again,

17:48.560 --> 17:50.900
because sometimes that's what happens
in a relationship.

17:50.980 --> 17:54.280
And it's not your job
to protect me from that.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.450
-I feel like it is.
-I'm telling you it isn't.

17:57.530 --> 17:59.450
I just want to make sure
that somebody's looking out for you.

17:59.530 --> 18:01.280
Oh, sweetheart.

18:01.370 --> 18:05.750
Why don't you chill the eff out
and give Jacob a chance?

18:08.210 --> 18:10.290
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, wait.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.380
You worked on the Hubble telescope?

18:13.460 --> 18:16.880
I worked on a team that worked for a team

18:16.970 --> 18:18.930
that worked on the Hubble telescope.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.720
He's being modest.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.430
-He has a letter from the president.
-No way.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.770
Once I was held back
from riding an elevator

18:25.850 --> 18:28.310
because the first lady
was riding in it.

18:30.980 --> 18:34.320
Do you have stories?
Or is it-- Is it top secret?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.150
I get it. I get it.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.280
You'll tell me later.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.700
I can fix it.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.070
Grace?

18:44.490 --> 18:48.250
I like one-third cake,
one-third berries and two-thirds cream.

18:48.330 --> 18:49.500
That's four-thirds.

18:49.580 --> 18:51.130
I guess it is.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.960
Here she comes. Ooh.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.340
-Are you drunk?
-Oh, I hope so. I drank enough.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.590
Oh...

19:05.140 --> 19:06.970
Oh, that is so good.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.270
Why don't I eat cake more?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.770
Oh.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.650
How about some coffee?

19:13.730 --> 19:15.480
Nah, it keeps me up.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.860
Mmm.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.450
-Oh, how are you, Jacob?
-Can't complain.

19:22.530 --> 19:24.330
Oh, you guys, you make a great couple.

19:25.410 --> 19:27.620
You're gonna make
beautiful babies one day.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.660
Oh, I think that ship has sailed.

19:30.500 --> 19:34.500
Oh, right. Because
you're afraid of sex in the vagina.

19:36.130 --> 19:38.380
-OK. Party's over.
-No. Why?

19:38.460 --> 19:40.590
You're always telling me to eat
and I'm eating.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.260
This is how I do it.
Bud told me he was done.

19:43.340 --> 19:46.810
-Bud did not say that.
-Grace, what are my eyes saying?

19:46.890 --> 19:49.100
Oh, probably more of your hippie bullshit.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.980
-That was harsh.
-OK.

19:51.060 --> 19:52.690
I think somebody's ready for bed.

19:52.770 --> 19:56.190
No! No, I'm ready to purge.

19:56.270 --> 19:58.480
Isn't that what we do here?
We purge our feelings.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.490
That along with a bunch of other stuff.

20:01.570 --> 20:07.030
Come on. Beddy-bye. This is not the time
or the place to purge our feelings.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.080
-Come on, you goonch.
-Passive resistance.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.540
-No, use your feet.
-Is that what gets you off?

20:11.620 --> 20:12.920
You're being mean to me.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.630
Because I just realized how much
better off I was without you.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.800
How can you say that to me?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.760
-Because you're a bully.
-How am I a bully?

20:21.840 --> 20:25.090
You bullied me into Phil.
You bully me into feelings.

20:26.390 --> 20:28.140
I don't want to feel!

20:29.390 --> 20:30.810
Then don't. I don't care.

20:31.890 --> 20:33.810
You liar. You do care.

20:33.890 --> 20:37.060
Because if your "Better Grace"
project doesn't work out,

20:37.150 --> 20:40.400
I'm just like everything else you do.
A total failure!

20:40.480 --> 20:43.320
And we're done. Come on.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.160
Oh! I'm not done! I'm still eating.
Give me some cake.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.620
-Take it to go.
-I love him.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.040
-Where do you want her?
-How about the middle of the ocean?

20:53.250 --> 20:55.250
No, no, no. She's-- She's just kidding.

20:55.330 --> 20:58.340
Hey, she was just kidding.
She was just kidding.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.130
You OK?

21:02.090 --> 21:03.550
Oh, yeah.

21:05.720 --> 21:09.390
Mm. That looks good, love.
Thank you for making dinner.

21:09.470 --> 21:13.520
Thank you for going "Mm" when
you know it's cashew-cheese lasagna.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.490
What?

21:23.570 --> 21:25.400
Nothing, it's just...

21:26.780 --> 21:29.530
All I can see is you hunched over there
after the heart attack.

21:30.910 --> 21:35.160
And I haven't been able to sit there
since the night you told me about Frankie.

21:36.370 --> 21:38.170
Maybe we should eat in the dining room?

21:38.250 --> 21:41.630
Where Grace and I told our daughters
I was leaving her?

21:41.710 --> 21:44.470
-That was a fun brunch.
-Right.

21:44.550 --> 21:46.130
How about the sun room?

21:46.220 --> 21:50.430
Where Stan Singer almost caught us
kissing New Year's Eve, 1999?

21:50.510 --> 21:53.020
Why did we risk kissing that night,
anyway?

21:53.100 --> 21:55.890
It was Y2K.
We thought the world was ending.

21:55.980 --> 21:57.020
Ahh...

21:57.100 --> 21:58.900
I suppose we could eat on the stairs.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.230
Where you almost bludgeoned me
with a toilet plunger?

22:03.780 --> 22:06.570
It's this whole house, isn't it?

22:08.570 --> 22:09.910
But it's your house.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.160
But it's never been ours.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.700
I was happier this morning
with you in that dump.

22:15.450 --> 22:17.290
-You want to go back?
-No, no.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.250
But I think we should
call a realtor in the morning.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.630
Wow. That's...

22:25.380 --> 22:27.170
an exciting idea.

22:28.550 --> 22:30.840
But where do we
actually eat tonight's dinner?

22:30.930 --> 22:33.180
-At a restaurant.
-Mm!

22:38.810 --> 22:39.770
OK.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.920
Frankie?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.500
Frankie?

23:09.630 --> 23:12.430
"I threw away your alcohol.
You're welcome.

23:12.510 --> 23:15.180
And don't worry,
I recycled the bottles."

23:16.060 --> 23:18.310
Oh, fuck.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.190
Oh...

23:48.510 --> 23:52.890
I can't believe how mad I am
that Grace made me so mad.

23:52.970 --> 23:56.510
I mean, she was so drunk,
I don't even know why I was listening,

23:56.600 --> 24:00.140
although sometimes that's when
the things you really mean come out.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.850
When you're not thinking.
That's the whole theory behind improv.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.730
I'm gonna have a hell of a walk
with her tomorrow.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.570
Oh, please don't. She's too mean
to deserve a walk with you.

24:10.650 --> 24:14.370
I hate to change the subject but,
critical juncture:

24:14.450 --> 24:17.620
Racing car or snail in a top hat?

24:17.700 --> 24:21.040
What about cross-eyed bear?
I feel bad for him.

24:21.910 --> 24:24.380
Marty Feldman,
you're coming to the party.

24:24.460 --> 24:27.460
He's so cute.

24:27.540 --> 24:30.090
Almost makes you think twice
about beating him to a pulp,

24:30.170 --> 24:31.630
which I am going to do.

24:34.510 --> 24:37.010
Beep, beep! Beep, beep!
Beep, beep!

24:43.140 --> 24:44.310
Fuck.

24:47.690 --> 24:49.270
Oh.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.650
Come on.

25:00.410 --> 25:03.040
I'm sorry, ma'am,
it looks like we're all out of that size.

25:03.120 --> 25:06.250
-We have other brands.
-No. Just give me the size you do have.

25:06.330 --> 25:10.550
We have these fun little baby sized ones.
I mean, not baby as in a baby, but--

25:10.630 --> 25:14.170
Great.
How many of these equal a regular bottle?

25:15.180 --> 25:17.090
Like, probably a hundred.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.240
We've got masks, we got pilgrim hats,

25:33.320 --> 25:35.860
we got a great deal
on 2013 sunglasses.

25:35.950 --> 25:38.320
We just need that kid to come back
with the helium.

25:38.410 --> 25:42.240
Now I appreciate you letting me
put whatever I want into the cart,

25:42.330 --> 25:45.080
but I'm a little confused as to theme.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.460
I have a theory, dare I say wish...?

25:47.540 --> 25:48.790
Hit me.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.800
A sweet sixteen party
for your breast reduction.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.590
Close.

25:54.670 --> 25:57.260
-A bon voyage party.
-For you?

25:57.340 --> 26:00.430
<i>- Pour moi.</i>

26:00.510 --> 26:01.970
I don't know French.

26:02.060 --> 26:06.690
Well, if you want a tarot card reading
from Jean-Pierre, I suggest you learn.

26:06.770 --> 26:10.060
Are you really going away again?
You just got back.

26:10.150 --> 26:13.230
I'm still basking in the glow
of your <i> joie de vivre.</i>

26:14.070 --> 26:16.360
I do know French.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.860
Where are you going this time?
Can I tag along?

26:18.950 --> 26:21.490
I'm sorry, honey, you can't come.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.790
Please? I'm really fun to be with,
and I really need a vacation from Grace.

26:25.870 --> 26:29.250
-I'm sure you do, but this isn't it.
-Why?

26:29.330 --> 26:34.460
Because I'm going to the one place
you don't come back from.

26:34.550 --> 26:36.510
A Carnival cruise?

26:36.590 --> 26:38.760
No, sunshine.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.510
That's not where I'm going.

26:40.590 --> 26:43.760
Ma'am? Would you like me
to ring this up for you?

26:43.850 --> 26:45.430
-Yes, please.
-OK.

26:46.560 --> 26:49.440
Bye-bye, Babe.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.110
The party to end all parties.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.360
My God.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.400
And I need you to help me.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.750
Oh, come on!

27:18.170 --> 27:19.220
Hello?

27:19.300 --> 27:22.850
Hey, Frankie. It's Grace.

27:22.930 --> 27:25.510
I need you to come pick me up.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.810
Find your own way home.

27:27.890 --> 27:31.650
Oh, wait. I have coupons.
