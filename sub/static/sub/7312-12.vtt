WEBVTT

00:03.873 --> 00:07.833
Well, Allison,
the most valuable asset

00:07.877 --> 00:10.445
in America's Navy today
is personnel.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.403
Smart, dedicated,
young people

00:12.447 --> 00:13.970
just like yourself.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.059
The best our country
has to offer.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.495
Here, take these home

00:17.539 --> 00:19.454
and read them over
with your parents.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.108
You got a big decision to make.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.109
Okay, thanks.

00:41.650 --> 00:44.392
Oh, sorry,
I didn't see you there.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.045
[grunts]
Whoa!

00:54.663 --> 00:56.534
[moaning in pain]

00:58.362 --> 01:00.930
[gasping for air]

01:41.449 --> 01:42.885
McGEE:
So...

01:42.928 --> 01:44.713
where is she?
Who?

01:44.756 --> 01:47.585
Tony, Ziva's been gone
since Thursday.

01:47.629 --> 01:50.893
Oh, this... Ziva.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.677
Gosh, I hadn't noticed.

01:52.721 --> 01:55.115
[scoffs] You are lying.

01:55.158 --> 01:58.683
Magoo, I have better things
to do than to obsess

01:58.727 --> 02:00.381
over the whereabouts of our
little Miss Fancypants Ziva.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.860
Yeah? Like what?

02:01.904 --> 02:03.123
Well, for instance,

02:03.166 --> 02:04.254
there's lunch.
Today I'm thinking falafel.

02:04.298 --> 02:05.690
Tony...

02:05.734 --> 02:07.997
All right, she spent the weekend
with him.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.477
Him who?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.043
The Sire of
South Beach,

02:11.087 --> 02:14.003
the King of Key West,
the man with the... Mr....

02:14.046 --> 02:16.136
I'm running out of things
to call him.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.007
She won't even
tell us his name.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.878
Morning.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.230
Gorgeous day.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.796
It's 27 degrees out.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.015
Who are you?

02:26.058 --> 02:27.016
[clears throat]

02:27.059 --> 02:29.410
My name is, uh, is Magnus.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.847
I'm meeting with Dr. Mallard.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.065
Oh, okay.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.155
Is Ducky in
the pond yet, McGee?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.721
I haven't seen him.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.027
You're welcome to wait here,
though, if you'd like.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.768
Uh, if you don't mind, I...

02:39.811 --> 02:43.206
I'd like to-to wait in...
in Autopsy.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.599
[chuckles] You sure?

02:44.642 --> 02:45.991
Smells funny.

02:46.035 --> 02:49.430
Well, that's... that's a matter
of opinion.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.780
It's a matter of dead bodies.
Stinky.

02:51.823 --> 02:55.566
Your escort will be happy
to take you there,

02:55.610 --> 02:57.002
Mr. Magnus.

02:57.046 --> 03:01.224
Uh, Doctor, and...
I-I think I know the way.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.138
All right.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.100
Friend of yours, Tim?

03:08.144 --> 03:09.232
He says he knows Ducky.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.929
Looks familiar.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.496
Come on! Grab your gear!

03:12.540 --> 03:14.237
Don't want
to miss the school bus.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.021
Class trip, boss?

03:16.065 --> 03:19.024
Got a dead petty officer
in a high school stairwell.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.156
Janitor found him this morning.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.811
Oh. ♪ The wheels
on the bus go ♪

03:22.854 --> 03:26.162
GIBBS AND TONY:
♪ Round and round,
round and round... ♪

03:26.206 --> 03:27.555
[camera snapping]

03:29.339 --> 03:33.082
Whew! Heck of a fall.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.388
Guess nobody heard him.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.564
In high school, no one can
hear you scream.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.435
Of course, it wasn't high
school, was it?

03:38.479 --> 03:42.352
It was space; Alien,1979.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.485
Ridley Scott and that
Sigourney Weaver.

03:44.528 --> 03:45.921
Tall drink of water, but you...

03:45.964 --> 03:47.401
Shutting up, boss.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.186
Nose is broken,
jaw looks shattered, too.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.492
GIBBS:
Got an I.D.?

03:51.535 --> 03:55.496
"Petty Officer First Class
Simon Craig, 27."

03:55.539 --> 03:58.847
Did two tours overseas,
then requested a transfer
back to the States.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.675
Been working out
of the Naval Recruiting Station

04:00.718 --> 04:02.503
in Alexandria
ever since.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.722
Musty stench of high school
stairwells.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.290
Copped my first feel in a
stairwell very much like this.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.292
Alice Kratzenstein.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.598
Hey, DiNozzo.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.427
Anyway, I.D. and cards are gone.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.385
No cash.Robbery.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.474
Gone bad, maybe.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.476
Navy ring's still on his finger.GIBBS: His watch, too.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.436
Check with the school for
kids with discipline problems.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.264
Find out who he reported to.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.830
Ducky will give us
a time of death.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.049
Where is Ducky?

04:27.092 --> 04:29.747
Dr. Mallard is...
is right behind me.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.012
At least he was.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.449
Why do people
always get killed

04:35.492 --> 04:40.105
in the least
accessible places?

04:40.149 --> 04:43.761
I once found a ship's cook
all chopped up

04:43.805 --> 04:47.939
an-and left in a...
in a deep fryer.

04:47.983 --> 04:51.943
The sailors nibbled on him
and the... and the calamari

04:51.987 --> 04:53.684
for days.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.905
Could someone please help me
down the steps?

04:56.948 --> 04:59.429
My... my knees aren't
what they used to be.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.778
Magnus, right?

05:00.822 --> 05:01.866
Right.
And you're, uh...

05:01.910 --> 05:05.305
you're Gibbs.
I-I-I remember you.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.307
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember you, too.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.178
Doc, you can take a look,
but you can't stay here.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.179
It's a crime scene.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.094
Oh, sure I can.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.052
No, you can't.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.054
Well, I'm, I'm not
gonna bother you.

05:16.098 --> 05:19.319
I'm not gonna touch
the... the merchandise.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.844
I'm just here as a...
as an observer today.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.368
[quietly]: I hope so.
You're retired, Doc.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.892
I'm sorry.
Retired from what?

05:27.936 --> 05:31.113
NCIS.

05:31.156 --> 05:34.725
Tony, meet former
medical examiner

05:34.769 --> 05:38.163
and my esteemed predecessor
Dr. Walter Magnus.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.035
Ma-Magnus is my guest.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.298
Bringing guests to crime scenes
now are you, Duck?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.561
Only ones that used to be me.

05:44.605 --> 05:47.477
Oh, the clock's
ticking, Gibbs.

05:47.521 --> 05:50.132
You-you really should get
this man into autopsy...

05:50.175 --> 05:53.875
be-before we all die of...
of old age.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.050
[chuckles]

05:55.093 --> 05:56.399
[laughs]

05:56.443 --> 05:59.359
Very nice to see you again, Doc.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.370
DUCKY:
Recognize that light box?

06:10.413 --> 06:14.025
[chuckles]
I think it might be
older than you are.

06:14.069 --> 06:17.289
[chuckles]
Nothing's older than I am.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.856
You know, Walter,
when you called

06:18.900 --> 06:20.380
to say that you were coming

06:20.423 --> 06:22.643
to visit at such
short notice,

06:22.686 --> 06:24.427
I was a bit surprised.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.082
Well, there's no-no time
like the present.

06:27.125 --> 06:32.522
Retirement does have
some advantages.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.698
It's not how you
felt when you left.

06:34.742 --> 06:41.139
I-I knew I'd left the
department in-in good hands.

06:41.183 --> 06:44.055
You-you've done a fantastic job,
Donald.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.622
Thank you, Doctor.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.363
Rest assured it hasn't been

06:47.407 --> 06:49.191
without its challenges.
[chuckles]

06:49.234 --> 06:51.759
Tell me,
are you still living

06:51.802 --> 06:53.978
with your lovely wife
in South Carolina?

06:54.022 --> 06:59.462
Sweet Elizabeth passed...

06:59.506 --> 07:01.464
almost a decade now.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.900
I'm sorry.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.815
No, no, no,
don't be.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.948
We had 47 years of happiness.

07:06.991 --> 07:10.473
A man... a man can't ask
for more than that.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.953
And your daughter?

07:14.825 --> 07:17.088
Since her mother
died, we, um...

07:17.132 --> 07:20.918
Jenny and I, we-we
don't talk much.

07:20.962 --> 07:25.270
She has her
own family now.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.186
People grow apart.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.886
Life goes on.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.063
Well,

07:35.106 --> 07:37.718
you'll always
be welcome here.

07:37.761 --> 07:41.156
It's, it's good being back,
Donald.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.202
[chuckles]

07:44.246 --> 07:45.508
[typing]

07:45.552 --> 07:47.771
Petty Officer First Class
Simon Craig.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.252
He's a local kid out of
Chesapeake City, Maryland.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.340
He single?

07:51.383 --> 07:52.341
Never married.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.082
His parents died
in a car accident

07:54.125 --> 07:55.170
when he was a kid.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.998
He was raised by his
older sister Nina.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.653
Nina runs the family
crabbing business.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.177
TONY:
Mmm, crabs!
Get a loaf

08:02.220 --> 08:03.744
of bread and a
pitcher of beer.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.789
Glad to see you haven't
lost your appetite, DiNozzo.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.095
Sister's on her way now.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.531
Recruiting station?

08:08.575 --> 08:12.361
I spoke to his boss,
Chief Petty Officer Jerome Carr.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.972
The Alexandria office
is anxious to cooperate.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.017
Check for rejected applicants.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.540
Rejects R us, boss.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.194
VANCE:
Gibbs...

08:20.761 --> 08:22.284
I need a moment.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.955
GIBBS:
How are you holding up, Leon?

08:40.998 --> 08:42.609
VANCE:
How do you think?

08:42.652 --> 08:45.916
I'm on a strict diet
of paperwork and painkillers.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.049
I'm glad to have you back.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.746
I'm glad
to be back,

08:49.790 --> 08:51.226
considering
the alternative.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.707
Where are we
on that recruiter case?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.186
We're just
getting started.

08:55.230 --> 08:59.539
It's a hell of a lot of
catching up to do, Gibbs.

08:59.582 --> 09:03.107
Did you sign anything, did you
read anything in my absence?

09:03.151 --> 09:04.326
No.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.284
It comes with the job.

09:06.328 --> 09:09.157
Better you than me.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.857
No doubt I'm appreciative,

09:13.901 --> 09:16.730
but since I got hurt,
we've been on SECNAV's radar,

09:16.773 --> 09:18.383
and I want to prove

09:18.427 --> 09:20.995
that recent events haven't
influenced things around here.

09:21.038 --> 09:24.215
It's gonna take you a while
to get on track, Leon.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.130
You're lucky to be alive.

09:26.174 --> 09:28.089
You don't think I know that?

09:28.132 --> 09:30.221
No, I do think
you know it.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.528
I think
you also feel responsible.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.486
Things needed to be dealt with.

09:34.530 --> 09:39.100
All right, then, suck it up,
move on.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.711
Get back to work, Agent Gibbs.

09:44.061 --> 09:47.804
You, too, Director... Vance.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.589
[door closes]

09:49.632 --> 09:51.591
[sighs]

09:51.634 --> 09:53.941
CARR:
I informed the district office
in Richmond

09:53.984 --> 09:56.030
of Petty Officer Craig's death.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.119
This is a tremendous loss
to the Navy.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.338
He was a good man.

10:00.382 --> 10:04.386
How's the recruiting business
been, Carr?

10:04.429 --> 10:06.344
We're up about five percent
from last year.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.696
Not everybody makes
Uncle Sam's cut, huh?

10:09.739 --> 10:11.436
Absolutely not.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.613
There are written
and physical evaluations,

10:13.656 --> 10:17.181
a full criminal background check
and then the interviews.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.922
So, if everything's looking up,

10:18.966 --> 10:21.316
who would want to kill
Petty Officer Craig?

10:21.359 --> 10:23.623
One guy really held a grudge
against Craig.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.495
Kept calling, leaving
threatening messages.

10:26.538 --> 10:29.150
Even contacted our
commanding officer
at District.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.805
The train wreck have a name?

10:31.848 --> 10:35.504
James Zanetti.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.159
Our recruiter job is
to find career sailors.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.162
Zanetti had issues.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.554
[whistles] That's
an understatement.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.295
Work address is on the form.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.688
Knock yourselves out.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.385
ABBY:
It's amazing that you guys

10:47.429 --> 10:49.083
didn't have all these
computers and stuff,

10:49.126 --> 10:51.738
and you solved cases, like
really complicated cases.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.436
I mean, I know that coroners
were doing forensic autopsies

10:54.479 --> 10:56.351
back then, but it
wasn't until 1975

10:56.394 --> 10:58.701
that the FBI
installed their first

10:58.745 --> 11:00.398
automated fingerprint reader.

11:00.442 --> 11:04.359
That sort of revolutionized
what I do, or what, what we do.

11:04.402 --> 11:08.929
I-I-I haven't understood one...
one thing you said,

11:08.972 --> 11:10.974
but I'm, I'm all for it.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.847
Uh, forensics have certainly
changed, haven't they, Doctor?

11:13.890 --> 11:15.762
Yes, indeed.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.242
You should see her when she
gets excited about a case.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.375
ABBY:
Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs!

11:20.418 --> 11:22.203
Come meet Dr. Magnus. He's
like a forensic history book,

11:22.246 --> 11:23.683
and he's adorable.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.685
I mean that with the utmost
professional respect.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.338
Yeah.
We've met.

11:27.382 --> 11:28.688
What do you
got, Abbs?

11:28.731 --> 11:30.820
Well, I digitally lifted

11:30.864 --> 11:33.518
a boot print from Petty Officer
Craig's facial features.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.912
After he was hit
at the top of the steps,

11:35.956 --> 11:38.262
he landed at the bottom of the
stairs with multiple contusions,

11:38.306 --> 11:40.177
a concussion,
broken bones,

11:40.221 --> 11:42.005
but this was the death blow.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.488
It was a single downward blow.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.359
that crushed the front
of his skull.

11:48.403 --> 11:51.406
DUCKY:
Leading to a severe
temporal hemorrhage.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.755
You have details
on the boot print, Abbs?

11:52.799 --> 11:53.713
Yep.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.847
It is a Global Trailbreaker
work boot.

11:57.891 --> 12:03.070
Un-Unbelievable. What I would've
given for a, a, a piece of,

12:03.113 --> 12:04.985
of hardware like her.
I mean, like,

12:05.028 --> 12:06.508
like, like this.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.337
Well, you were part of
a different era, Walter.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.209
An era that had to work
harder for results.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.298
Ah, hell, Doc, nothing
to be ashamed of.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.997
There was also a wood tack

12:17.040 --> 12:19.042
embedded in the boot's
rubber heel, and Ducky found

12:19.086 --> 12:20.522
particles of sawdust
in the grooves.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.089
Killer's a woodworker.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.090
Thank you, Abbs.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.179
He...

12:25.222 --> 12:27.790
He, he just kissed her.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.576
Well, consider it an innocent
gesture of endearment.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.452
[sneezes violently]

12:37.495 --> 12:38.801
Cover your mouth.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.804
I'm allergic to sawdust.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.632
Mostly pine.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.417
Better with hardwoods,
you know, walnut, oak.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.810
Were you a sickly child?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.464
'Cause I'm betting
you were a sickly child.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.031
I need my inhaler.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
I want Ziva back.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.164
All right, let's just
get this over with.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.775
Where's Zanetti?
Aha!

12:55.818 --> 12:57.907
What do you think about
the dude at the chop saw?

12:57.951 --> 12:59.082
Forearms like Popeye?

12:59.126 --> 13:00.301
Tattoos?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.694
Let's approach him carefully.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.350
James Zanetti...

13:06.394 --> 13:07.743
turn off the chop saw.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.005
[saw buzzing]

13:09.049 --> 13:11.660
Zanetti, federal agents!

13:11.703 --> 13:13.923
[groaning]

13:13.967 --> 13:15.229
[saw buzzing]

13:15.272 --> 13:18.188
Hands in the air, now!

13:27.719 --> 13:29.243
Oh, hey. Did you
break Zanetti?

13:29.286 --> 13:32.246
I offered to drop the
lumber assault charge

13:32.289 --> 13:33.900
if he confessed
to Craig's murder.

13:33.943 --> 13:36.467
Oh. Yeah, he almost put your
head in a Cuisinart, though.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.034
Yeah, well, Zanetti admits
to sending hate mail

13:38.078 --> 13:39.470
to the recruitment office,

13:39.514 --> 13:41.385
but swears up and down
he didn't kill anybody.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.387
And you believe him.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.476
Took an extension
class last night.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.869
Couldn't have done it.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.871
"How to Pick Up Girls."

13:48.915 --> 13:50.090
That guy?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.395
So now what?

13:51.439 --> 13:52.570
I'm going to be checking
disciplinary records,

13:52.614 --> 13:54.094
and the guidance counselor

13:54.137 --> 13:56.226
gave us a list of five kids
Craig was advising.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.276
TONY:
I thought you
were in Miami.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.886
You look... positively Alpine.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.627
He came to me.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.890
We went skiing again,
this time to Vermont.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.544
TONY [laughs]:
Vermont. That's...

14:09.587 --> 14:11.154
so quaint.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.764
They have all those
lovely little

14:12.808 --> 14:15.202
country inns, and,
uh, cozy fires,

14:15.245 --> 14:17.726
and sticky maple syrup
that gets everywhere.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.293
He enjoys nature,

14:19.336 --> 14:21.556
and I discovered that
he's a fantastic cook.

14:21.599 --> 14:24.994
He made this-- oof,
delicious-- osso bucco.TONY: Aren't you lucky.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.866
So he's a real
Renaissance man, huh?

14:26.909 --> 14:29.651
He is an experienced man,

14:29.694 --> 14:31.740
who knows how to
appreciate life.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.394
There is a difference.

14:33.437 --> 14:34.830
So when do we
get to meet him?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.614
And please tell
us his name.
TONY:
Oh, no!

14:36.658 --> 14:38.312
Please. Let me guess.
Zeus?

14:38.355 --> 14:39.922
Uh... Thor.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.358
His name is Ray.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.925
Ray?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.971
What a nice little name.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.930
Ray, like Ray Kroc or
Ray Charles or Sugar Ray?

14:47.974 --> 14:52.630
Um... I promise you,
Ray is a good man.

14:55.024 --> 14:58.245
My brother loved the
Navy, Agent Gibbs.

14:58.288 --> 15:01.248
And he loved helping
people even more.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.510
That's what made him
such a good recruiter.

15:04.816 --> 15:09.343
A man has to enjoy his work
to do it well.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.736
Personal life?

15:11.780 --> 15:13.434
Nothing out of the ordinary.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.959
Women.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.965
Guess it won't
do any harm now.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.662
What?

15:24.706 --> 15:27.361
Telling the truth.

15:29.363 --> 15:33.062
Agent Gibbs,
my brother was gay.

15:33.106 --> 15:36.326
We didn't talk
about it much.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.025
Couldn't.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.202
Was he involved with anyone?

15:46.075 --> 15:48.295
High school teacher.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.384
English, I think.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.081
Teacher have a name?

15:55.258 --> 15:59.001
TONY [clears throat]: Glenn
Block, tenth-grade English?

15:59.045 --> 16:00.568
You're looking at him.

16:00.611 --> 16:01.743
NCIS.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.224
Special Agents
DiNozzo and David.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.313
ZIVA:
We would like to speak
with you for a moment.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.619
Of course.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.012
It's about the murder of
Petty Officer Simon Craig.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.755
We understand
you knew him?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.626
We were friends.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.803
According to some, you were
a little more than friends.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.373
Um...

16:36.734 --> 16:39.346
BLOCK: We'd been seeing
each other for about a month.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.654
It was comfortable, you know?

16:43.698 --> 16:48.529
Unfortunately, I'm also in
a committed relationship.

16:48.572 --> 16:52.881
Did your other partner know
about Petty Officer Craig?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.839
It's not a man.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.974
It's my wife.
Oh, boy.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.890
Penny threw me out. I've
been staying in a motel.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.806
So... is she angry
enough to kill?

17:04.849 --> 17:06.460
Don't be ridiculous.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.027
She didn't kill Simon.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.811
How can you be so sure?

17:09.854 --> 17:13.554
I've been married
to her for 11 years.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.295
I know.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.123
We will need to talk to her.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.908
Please.

17:19.951 --> 17:23.346
Do you understand what
something like this

17:23.390 --> 17:27.089
could do to our lives?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.569
To my career?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.008
[school bell ringing]Don't envy that guy.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.923
At least he's being
honest with himself.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.098
With who he really is.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.187
No one said life is easy.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.147
Wow. All that skiing
made your blood run cold.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.714
I'm not being cold-hearted.
I'm being realistic.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.716
At least the wife
knows the truth.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.457
TEENAGE BOY:
Dad, don't stress.
I'll handle it.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.068
BOY'S DAD: No, you won't
handle it, Paul.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.895
TONY:
Hey, check it out.

17:50.939 --> 17:54.116
I think that might be one of
the kids Craig was talking to.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.944
It won't take away
from anything else.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.164
You've made those promises
to me in the past.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.861
Yeah, well,
I'll keep this one.

17:59.904 --> 18:02.124
Paul Simmons?

18:02.168 --> 18:04.083
Yeah?

18:04.126 --> 18:06.259
NCIS. Could we talk
to you for a second?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.872
Actually, we're a little late
for a meeting with his

18:10.915 --> 18:12.395
guidance counselor.We'll be quick.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.356
Do you recognize this man?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.317
Yeah, that's the Navy guy
I've been talking to.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.145
What Navy guy?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.147
ZIVA:
When did you see him last?

18:25.191 --> 18:27.018
Last week, maybe.
Why?

18:27.062 --> 18:28.672
He's dead.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.286
Wow.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.638
Simon was a cool guy.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.641
Anything you can tell us
would be helpful.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.034
There's nothing to say,
really; we just talked.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.775
About...?

18:44.819 --> 18:47.430
School. College stuff, mostly.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.650
Listen, we really do need
to be getting inside now.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.392
Paul. If you can think
of anything else,

18:52.435 --> 18:54.002
anything, uh, unusual,

18:54.045 --> 18:56.004
give me a call.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.179
[school bell ringing]

18:57.223 --> 18:58.485
TONY:
Have a nice day.

18:59.964 --> 19:01.444
What was that all about?

19:01.488 --> 19:02.837
Come on, no more surprises.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.404
Boots?

19:04.447 --> 19:08.059
Mm-hmm. I see.

19:08.103 --> 19:11.150
Is this, uh, is this
Willy Wong's, uh, Wok?

19:13.630 --> 19:17.373
Willy... Willy's been
closed for, for 13 years.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.897
Who, who is this?

19:19.941 --> 19:23.814
Ber-Bernie's...
Bernie's Burritos.

19:23.858 --> 19:28.036
Oh... Well, thank you
very much, Bernie, but [coughs]

19:28.079 --> 19:33.215
I, uh, I was kind of in the mood
for... for Chinese food.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.218
I told you, things have
changed around here.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.481
Um. I guess, I guess so.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.787
You wanted to see me, Duck?

19:39.830 --> 19:41.615
Ah! Yes, Jethro.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.573
Take a look
at these bruises.

19:43.617 --> 19:47.055
Many of them go
well below the surface

19:47.098 --> 19:48.709
and into deep muscle tissue.

19:48.752 --> 19:51.059
Guy fell down stairs, Duck.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.147
Bruised a lot of things.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.453
MAGNUS:
Those, those are older...

19:53.496 --> 19:55.890
injuries.
Even with these eyes,

19:55.933 --> 19:58.022
I could, I could see that.

19:58.066 --> 20:02.070
Contusions sustained days
before his death.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.680
Craig was in a fight?

20:03.724 --> 20:05.987
A beating is more like it.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.468
Dr. Magnus is correct.

20:08.511 --> 20:11.297
And there are other signs
of past injuries.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.169
Yeah, poorly healed
bone fractures.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.128
This was not
Petty Officer Craig's

20:17.172 --> 20:19.174
first physical encounter.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.263
Look, I know, I know
it's a bit unorthodox,

20:21.307 --> 20:23.657
but in Mr. Palmer's absence,

20:23.700 --> 20:26.529
I was wondering
if Dr. Magnus

20:26.573 --> 20:29.271
could, uh, continue to offer

20:29.315 --> 20:32.143
his expertise
if you've no objections.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.536
No, it's fine with me.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.017
Walter, why don't you
put on some scrubs,

20:36.060 --> 20:38.802
and we'll, uh...

20:40.326 --> 20:41.501
Walter?

20:43.894 --> 20:45.635
Walter?

20:47.681 --> 20:50.292
Oh, uh, oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
I was just...

20:50.336 --> 20:52.425
[clears throat]

20:52.468 --> 20:55.602
You know, it's been a while
since I observed a...

20:55.645 --> 20:58.692
an autopsy. Um...

20:58.735 --> 21:02.130
Think I could use a,
a little... a little air.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.958
Mm.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.569
[cell phone ringing]

21:06.613 --> 21:07.614
[phone beeps on]

21:07.657 --> 21:09.224
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.140
Glenn Block's wife was just
arrested on a DUI charge.

21:12.183 --> 21:15.361
There was also a pair of
Global Trailbreaker work boots

21:15.404 --> 21:16.884
in the trunk of her car.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.059
Bring her in.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.939
GIBBS:
You know him?

21:28.983 --> 21:31.333
Seen him before.

21:31.377 --> 21:34.162
He's dead.

21:34.205 --> 21:37.339
Won't catch me crying over him.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.909
Petty Officer Craig
fought for his country.

21:41.952 --> 21:45.129
And I'm fighting
for my marriage.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.348
And nobody is
giving me a medal.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.701
When did you learn about
your husband's affair?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.183
I had a feeling
something was up,

21:55.226 --> 21:57.577
so I followed him.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.187
Found his car,

21:59.230 --> 22:02.756
parked at a motel
off the interstate.

22:02.799 --> 22:06.281
Wasn't what I was expecting.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.544
Your husband ever do anything
like this before?

22:11.417 --> 22:13.723
You think I'd be here if he had?

22:16.247 --> 22:19.642
Eight days ago, you made
a large withdrawal

22:19.686 --> 22:21.775
from your bank.

22:21.818 --> 22:25.605
We think that you hired
someone to assault Craig.

22:25.648 --> 22:26.910
Teach him a lesson.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.874
Anything you would
like to say about it?

22:33.917 --> 22:37.094
I hope it hurt.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.271
So you admit it.

22:40.315 --> 22:43.666
I'm not admitting anything.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.974
Maybe I should call a lawyer.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.236
For the DUI,

22:48.279 --> 22:50.717
the assault or the murder?

22:50.760 --> 22:53.067
[clicks tongue]

22:53.110 --> 22:55.852
Where were you,
night before last?

22:55.896 --> 22:58.072
At a bar.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.422
Looking for a real man.

23:17.700 --> 23:22.270
You got a lot of
hate in you, Penny.

23:24.490 --> 23:28.450
Yeah. I hated Craig...

23:28.494 --> 23:31.932
for stealing my husband.

23:31.975 --> 23:35.457
I hated the embarrassment.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.416
I hated the humiliation.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.902
But you didn't kill him.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.383
What do you think?

23:56.347 --> 23:58.524
Somebody. Talk to me.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.960
The night Craig was murdered,

24:00.003 --> 24:01.962
Penny Block was in Alexandria

24:02.005 --> 24:03.354
at a bar called,
appropriately enough,

24:03.398 --> 24:05.008
The Alibi Room.

24:05.052 --> 24:06.575
Was anyone unlucky enough
to pick her up?

24:06.619 --> 24:07.750
Well, according
to the bartender,

24:07.794 --> 24:09.535
most of the evening
was spent in a booth

24:09.578 --> 24:11.101
with a truck driver
named Ernhart.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.407
Could've hired somebody
to do this, too.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.539
What about the five kids

24:13.582 --> 24:15.366
Craig was recruiting? Anything?

24:15.410 --> 24:17.020
Two were with family, two were
playing varsity basketball

24:17.064 --> 24:18.674
in Reston. The only one
that had any contact

24:18.718 --> 24:20.023
with the petty officer

24:20.067 --> 24:21.590
that night was...Paul Simmons.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.592
ZIVA:
The boy we spoke to.

24:23.636 --> 24:26.203
Paul lost his mom a few
years ago to cancer.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.814
He's an only child.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.555
His father Lance
was recently laid off

24:29.598 --> 24:31.252
from a local factory job.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.036
No substantial run-ins
with the law,

24:33.080 --> 24:35.125
but his, uh, school file
indicates multiple suspensions.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.518
Details?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.259
The school has a history
of racial problems,

24:38.302 --> 24:39.739
all sorts of
social tension,

24:39.782 --> 24:43.351
but none of it links Paul
specifically to any of it.

24:43.394 --> 24:46.267
Petty Officer Craig had no idea
what he was walking into.

24:46.310 --> 24:49.313
Boss, uh, Director Vance
wants to see you.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.664
DUCKY:
Have any of you seen Dr. Magnus?

24:51.707 --> 24:53.709
I've been looking
for him everywhere.
Nope.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.842
Uh, sorry, Duck, not here.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.974
You try the break room?Well, it's odd--

24:58.018 --> 25:01.543
he left Autopsy a while ago and
seems to have just disappeared.

25:01.587 --> 25:02.675
Maybe he went home.

25:02.718 --> 25:05.416
Uh, possible
but unlikely.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.723
Well, I'm sure he's fine--
perhaps he went for a walk.

25:07.767 --> 25:11.118
Yeah. I'll check the lobby.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.206
[knocking]

25:12.249 --> 25:13.555
Come in.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.949
You want to see me?

25:15.992 --> 25:16.950
Mm.

25:16.993 --> 25:17.864
[door closes]

25:19.518 --> 25:21.998
Recruiter case.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.739
Now, you could've
called it anything else--

25:23.783 --> 25:25.524
why a potential hate crime?

25:27.003 --> 25:29.179
A zebra has stripes, Leon.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.442
Politically, this
is not the kind of attention

25:31.486 --> 25:33.183
I was looking for right now.

25:33.227 --> 25:36.447
What do you want me to do,
sweep it under the rug?

25:36.491 --> 25:38.928
I've never turned
a blind eye to a victim;

25:38.972 --> 25:40.887
I'm not about to start now.

25:40.930 --> 25:43.454
Do you have a basis
for your evaluation?

25:43.498 --> 25:46.980
Violence wasn't new
to Petty Officer Craig...

25:47.023 --> 25:49.765
only this time
he couldn't fight back.

25:49.809 --> 25:52.942
Gibbs, even with the change
in military regulation,

25:52.986 --> 25:55.902
you're about to tick off
a lot of very important people.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.687
Maybe.
It's a hell of
a can of worms.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.428
Well, someone's got to open it.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.648
And it might as well be you.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.214
Mm.
Hmm.

26:04.258 --> 26:07.130
[long sigh]

26:09.263 --> 26:11.352
I'm tired.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.103
Are you okay?

26:24.234 --> 26:26.585
I don't know.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.588
You need more time, Leon.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.241
You should take it.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.156
No.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.552
Can't do that, Gibbs-- that's...
that's pretty clear to me now.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.122
And that's your decision.

26:43.558 --> 26:44.994
Yes, it is.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.217
Abby, I got
your message.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.393
I came as quick
as I could.

26:52.436 --> 26:55.091
Now, did you have
a forensic epiphany

26:55.135 --> 26:57.616
on the recruiter case?No, not exactly.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.313
Well, what is it?

26:59.356 --> 27:00.357
It's Dr. Magnus--

27:00.401 --> 27:02.446
I found him.Oh, thank goodness!

27:02.490 --> 27:04.710
[chuckles]
I was beginning to worry
about the old man.

27:04.753 --> 27:05.580
You know, for
someone who...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.147
Ducky, please.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.410
Your friend needs you.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.281
Wh-Where is he?

27:12.456 --> 27:14.415
He's back here.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.857
How long as he
been like this?

27:21.901 --> 27:24.207
Well, I don't know--
I was out of my lab
for a while,

27:24.251 --> 27:26.340
and then I came back in
and turned the lights on

27:26.383 --> 27:29.082
and... there he was.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.824
I asked him if there was
anything I could do

27:31.867 --> 27:36.045
to help him, and he just
kind of looked at me and smiled.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.352
Walter?

27:38.395 --> 27:40.397
It-it's me, Donald.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.315
Donald?
Yeah.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.364
That's a hippo.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.935
Yes, it is.

27:57.153 --> 27:59.547
Fascinating creatures.

28:02.942 --> 28:06.075
Their sweat... is
the color of red.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.905
It's true.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.820
Disturbing.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.564
But-but beautiful.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.830
Walter... what's going on?

28:23.702 --> 28:27.488
I love it here at the zoo.

28:27.531 --> 28:30.752
So much to see.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.841
Like-like the hippos.

28:32.885 --> 28:36.671
It's a beautiful place.

28:39.065 --> 28:40.414
Um...

28:40.457 --> 28:41.850
help me get him up.

28:44.679 --> 28:47.073
[grunting]

28:47.116 --> 28:49.249
Go and get him
some water, please.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.164
Okay. Okay.

29:01.435 --> 29:04.351
Where am I?

29:06.527 --> 29:07.789
[knocking]

29:07.833 --> 29:10.531
It's open.

29:10.574 --> 29:11.967
Mr. Simmons?

29:12.011 --> 29:13.403
Agents DiNozzo
and David,

29:13.447 --> 29:15.144
NCIS.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.667
[door closes]Yeah, I remember you.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.191
If I'd known

29:18.234 --> 29:19.409
you were coming, I...

29:19.453 --> 29:20.889
[chuckles]
would have cleaned up.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.717
Yeah. So...

29:22.761 --> 29:25.241
looks like you're
doing a little, uh,

29:25.285 --> 29:26.721
renovation.

29:26.765 --> 29:30.377
Yeah, I'm doing it myself,
in case we have to... sell.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.379
What can I do for you?

29:32.422 --> 29:35.338
Uh, we actually wanted to
ask Paul more questions.
Is he around?

29:35.382 --> 29:36.862
Nah, that kid comes and goes.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.777
17-- you know how it is.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.430
So he's, uh...

29:40.474 --> 29:42.998
pretty interested
in going in the Navy, huh?

29:43.042 --> 29:45.087
[chuckles, scoffs]
You kidding?

29:45.131 --> 29:46.567
No, not my Paul.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.396
Why is that?

29:49.439 --> 29:51.441
'Cause he's never been
able to take orders.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.748
You know, he marches
to his own drum.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.882
So you had no knowledge
that he was talking to
Petty Officer Craig?

29:56.925 --> 29:59.667
No, I didn't. I hope
he didn't waste that guy's time.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.277
How would that
be a waste?

30:01.321 --> 30:04.150
Because he's my kid.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.500
Because I know what
he's capable of, and...

30:06.543 --> 30:08.719
you know, if he joined
the Navy right now,

30:08.763 --> 30:10.678
that wouldn't be good
for you or him.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.027
[door opens]

30:13.202 --> 30:15.161
LANCE:
Hey, Paul.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.510
Remember
these agents

30:16.553 --> 30:18.991
from this morning?Yeah. Sure.

30:19.034 --> 30:23.169
They just want to ask you
some more questions about
that recruiter who died.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.954
I already told you
everything that I know.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.521
It'll just take a second.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.611
LANCE:
Hey, Paul!

30:30.654 --> 30:31.786
Hey! Wait!Stay here!

30:38.706 --> 30:40.055
ZIVA:
Stop!

30:40.099 --> 30:41.404
Don't move!

30:41.448 --> 30:42.666
[tires screeching]

30:46.409 --> 30:47.323
Paul, get out of the car.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.849
Turn the engine off!

30:50.892 --> 30:52.067
Now!

31:03.557 --> 31:05.385
So, why'd you run, Paul?

31:07.648 --> 31:09.650
I don't know.

31:09.693 --> 31:13.088
Agents just wanted to talk.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.830
You hiding something?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.353
I got scared.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.268
Scared of what?

31:19.312 --> 31:20.748
Everything.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.970
You remember
Petty Officer Craig?

31:25.013 --> 31:27.363
Good guy.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.236
Yeah.

31:30.279 --> 31:34.631
Yeah, well, he just
wanted to talk, too.

31:38.984 --> 31:42.074
I'm beginning to think you
just don't like to talk, Paul.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.946
I didn't do that.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.861
I didn't hurt anybody.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.907
Agent Gibbs...

31:48.950 --> 31:50.952
my son is not a killer.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.215
May 2010, you got in a fight

31:53.259 --> 31:55.348
after school;
suspended.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.219
September, same year,

31:57.263 --> 31:58.394
another fight;
suspended again.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.961
You got a temper, Paul.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.963
Those weren't my fault.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.923
You don't understand.

32:04.966 --> 32:08.665
Witnesses put you at
the college fair the other day.

32:08.709 --> 32:11.016
They saw you with
Petty Officer Craig.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.975
I stayed for a
few minutes.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.282
We talked; I left.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.023
Yeah? Where'd you go then?Home.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.764
Prove it.
I can't.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.418
Wait, all right, that's enough.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.246
I think you met with
Petty Officer Craig afterward.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.987
No.
You were talking

32:26.031 --> 32:27.510
to him in the stairwell,
weren't you, Paul?

32:27.554 --> 32:29.077
No!
That's it!

32:29.121 --> 32:30.209
This-this is over.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.645
Let him answer.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.691
We need to speak privately,
Agent Gibbs.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.345
Now.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.527
[exhales]

32:50.490 --> 32:52.492
You can't do that!

32:52.535 --> 32:54.494
Yeah, I can, as long
as you're present.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.104
Look, Paul might
be hotheaded,

32:56.148 --> 32:59.020
he might be stubborn-- he
did not kill that sailor.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.022
Your son has a history
of acting out.

33:01.066 --> 33:04.678
Well, what kid doesn't?

33:04.721 --> 33:08.377
He admits he saw Craig
before he was murdered.

33:08.421 --> 33:10.031
You heard him.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.554
He was home.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.122
Where were you?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.037
Where were you,
Mr. Simmons?

33:16.081 --> 33:18.387
Were you out at a bar?

33:18.431 --> 33:21.347
Were you out
picking up a 12-pack?

33:22.522 --> 33:24.959
I was passed out in my car,

33:25.003 --> 33:26.656
drunk.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.313
Look...

33:31.357 --> 33:35.361
ever since his mother died,
Paul's had it rough.

33:35.404 --> 33:38.059
She understood him.

33:38.103 --> 33:41.628
You know, he just
needs a little...
a little guidance.

33:41.671 --> 33:46.024
You lose a parent that young,
like he did, he's messed up.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.025
That's all.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.637
[whispers]:
He's still got a father.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.513
Act like one.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.214
Here we are.

34:02.257 --> 34:03.824
The healing powers

34:03.867 --> 34:07.262
of a single cup of tea
are the equivalent

34:07.306 --> 34:09.917
of several hours rest.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.919
[chuckles]
So they say.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.227
There are many things my
Scottish ancestors got wrong,

34:15.270 --> 34:18.056
but taking the time to savor
a nice cup of Darjeeling

34:18.099 --> 34:19.753
was not one of them.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.627
Walter...

34:24.671 --> 34:26.716
I called your
daughter Jenny

34:26.760 --> 34:28.936
in South Carolina.

34:28.979 --> 34:32.418
You are not
estranged
from them.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.768
In fact, you live with her now,

34:34.811 --> 34:36.857
and the two boys.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.816
She's been terribly
worried about you.

34:39.860 --> 34:43.385
Yeah, Jenny, uh,
Jenny's a sweet kid.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.822
She's like her mother.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.824
Then why did you run away?

34:47.868 --> 34:49.391
Why come here?

34:49.435 --> 34:51.524
[pants]

34:51.567 --> 34:54.875
This, uh, this job...

34:54.918 --> 34:58.357
this-this place...

34:58.400 --> 34:59.923
was... well, it was...

34:59.967 --> 35:02.143
it was everything...

35:02.187 --> 35:04.319
t-to me.

35:04.363 --> 35:07.540
Well, I understand that.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.499
[wry chuckle]
Walter, you know.

35:10.543 --> 35:14.460
But now you have
grandchildren,

35:14.503 --> 35:18.159
and you have so much
to share with them.

35:18.203 --> 35:19.334
But, uh...

35:19.378 --> 35:21.293
I mean, then...

35:21.336 --> 35:24.122
my... my-my life had...

35:24.165 --> 35:26.211
it had purpose!

35:26.254 --> 35:29.823
Your family is your
purpose now, Walter.

35:29.866 --> 35:33.087
You have a responsibility
to those two boys

35:33.131 --> 35:35.829
to teach them
everything you can.

35:35.872 --> 35:38.048
But damn it, I can't!

35:39.615 --> 35:42.357
I mean, don't...
don't you see?

35:42.401 --> 35:45.143
Before the-the
symptoms started,

35:45.186 --> 35:46.709
before the...

35:49.190 --> 35:51.105
...hell, Alzheimer's
diagnosis...

35:52.846 --> 35:55.631
...I would run cases
in my head.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.634
Ev... Every autopsy,

35:58.678 --> 36:02.551
ev-every detail,
I remembered it all.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.336
And now...

36:04.379 --> 36:07.469
there's nothing!

36:07.513 --> 36:10.255
That's why I came here,

36:10.298 --> 36:12.996
just one last time,

36:13.040 --> 36:14.694
thinking that...

36:14.737 --> 36:17.436
that-that maybe it would...

36:17.479 --> 36:19.742
it would...
it would all come back.

36:21.353 --> 36:24.269

Donald...

36:24.312 --> 36:26.923
sometimes I can't remember...

36:29.361 --> 36:31.232
...who I was.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.242
Then let me show you.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.206
All right, who's got something?

36:48.249 --> 36:50.773
Paul got home before
Petty Officer Craig was killed.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.297
Prove it.
TONY:
One large

36:52.340 --> 36:54.342

extra pepperoni and sausage.

36:54.386 --> 36:56.126
He ordered a pizza?

36:56.170 --> 36:58.216
Delivery kid remembers him;
the receipt has

36:58.259 --> 36:59.739
a time stamp to prove it.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.871
Paul Simmons enlistment
contract, did it say

37:01.915 --> 37:03.569
anything out of
the ordinary?
Aside from

37:03.612 --> 37:05.092
some less-than-stellar grades,

37:05.135 --> 37:07.834
all the information
is truthful and accurate.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.270
According to Petty Officer
Craig's records,

37:09.314 --> 37:11.403
the other kids had
phone conversations with him

37:11.446 --> 37:12.491
on a regular basis.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.493
Questions about
deployment,

37:14.536 --> 37:15.929

petty officer's e-mail account.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.631

37:22.675 --> 37:23.632
Personal.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.286
Already got the warrant.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.332
I'm scanning,
but nothing addressed

37:27.375 --> 37:29.334

37:58.928 --> 38:02.280
The boy spilled his
heart out to him.

38:02.323 --> 38:05.761
All the fights at school were
just Paul defending himself.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.286
Craig was offering
the kid advice.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.766
Paul didn't want
to lie anymore.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.335
Petty Officer Craig...

38:14.379 --> 38:16.119
wanted to help.

38:22.387 --> 38:25.172
Petty Officer Craig understood.

38:25.215 --> 38:28.306
Thought he could
offer me a new life.

38:30.090 --> 38:32.875
He knew what I was feeling,

38:32.919 --> 38:35.313
what I was
going through.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.010
The fights?

38:37.053 --> 38:39.142
Since junior
high school.

38:39.186 --> 38:43.712
I tried to talk
to teachers, counselors.

38:43.756 --> 38:46.541
Nobody wanted to li... listen.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.630
What about your dad?

38:48.674 --> 38:50.676
Think about it.

38:50.719 --> 38:54.027
Your gay son comes to you,

38:54.070 --> 38:57.073
tells you he wants
to join the military.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.163
What would you say?

39:03.819 --> 39:07.388
I'd wish him luck...

39:07.432 --> 39:09.738

39:15.135 --> 39:18.530
My dad couldn't wrap
his head around it.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.880
Thought it was crazy.

39:23.012 --> 39:25.406
Rather than talk me out of it,

39:25.450 --> 39:28.104
he tried to make it all
just go away.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.297
[handcuffs tightening]

39:52.085 --> 39:55.436
All I wanted was
to protect my son.

You think I don't know
what was happening?

39:58.961 --> 40:01.747
Guy meets my son at all hours,

40:01.790 --> 40:04.967
sending him private e-mails.

40:05.011 --> 40:07.622
What if it wasn't
"just business"?

40:07.666 --> 40:09.755
No, Dad.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.061
No.

40:12.105 --> 40:15.587
That's not true.

40:15.630 --> 40:18.459
He was helping me.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.203
[quietly]: Oh...

40:25.858 --> 40:29.470
Paul, I just tried
to be a good dad.

trying to do.

to do this.

They're people you helped.

You gave them...
