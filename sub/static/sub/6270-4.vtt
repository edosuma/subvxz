<i>Previously on Witches of East End...</i>

00:01.805 --> 00:04.662
I don't want the girls doing magic.
It's too dangerous.

00:04.687 --> 00:07.843
You can't just bring someone back
from the dead without consequences.

00:07.844 --> 00:10.786
ou resurrect someone you love,
then someone you love has to die.

00:10.787 --> 00:12.981
Do you want to try
a fertility spell?

00:12.982 --> 00:14.022
(both gasp)

00:14.040 --> 00:15.857
The shape shifter
that has it out for your mom

00:15.875 --> 00:17.859
has taken your mom's form,
murdered Bill Thatcher...

00:17.877 --> 00:20.045
Joanna Beauchamp?
You are under arrest.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.364
You killed her husband
right before her eyes.

00:22.382 --> 00:25.417
- You look exactly the same.
- Immortality will do that.

00:25.418 --> 00:27.670
She had this strange little doll
made out of hair.

00:27.671 --> 00:29.121
It's called an energy talisman.

00:29.122 --> 00:31.400
JOANNA: Is it supposed
to suck away your powers?

00:31.408 --> 00:33.799
WENDY: No, not supposed to.
It does.

00:36.220 --> 00:39.551
JOANNA:
Ingrid! Freya!

00:48.522 --> 00:50.223
No!

00:51.133 --> 00:53.923
No... no!

00:53.932 --> 00:57.089
(crying):
No! No!

01:00.313 --> 01:02.761
- I'm sorry, Joanna.
- Vidar!

01:02.762 --> 01:04.946
But your girls were reckless
with their gifts.

01:04.947 --> 01:07.582
Vidar...

01:10.720 --> 01:14.274
- You turned them in?
- Well, it had to be done.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.782
- What?
- To keep our secret safe.

01:15.808 --> 01:17.509
It was the only way.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.845
No...

01:19.879 --> 01:23.371
But you... you took my girls...

01:24.150 --> 01:25.717
No!

01:25.735 --> 01:28.370
They were all I had
in this world!

01:47.123 --> 01:49.073
No, please!

01:50.640 --> 01:53.295
No! No! I beg you, no!

01:53.346 --> 01:57.248
No, please, no!
Spare me, I beg you!

01:57.266 --> 02:00.101
Aah! No!
Please, spare me!

02:00.136 --> 02:01.804
As you wish.

02:07.268 --> 02:11.222
- You actually cut off his ear?
- That is so badass.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.850
Now, I think you girls
are maybe missing the point.

02:13.851 --> 02:15.468
- INGRID: Are we?
- FREYA: What's the point?

02:15.486 --> 02:18.408
JOANNA: The point is
that even in that moment,

02:18.409 --> 02:19.976
when I thought
I'd lost everything,

02:19.977 --> 02:23.009
I mustered up the courage
not to kill him.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.223
Is she giving you the
"we don't kill" speech?

02:25.224 --> 02:26.488
Well, we don't.

02:26.489 --> 02:28.533
I like it better when
your witchcraft lessons

02:28.534 --> 02:30.764
contain lessons on
doing actual witchcraft.

02:30.765 --> 02:32.895
Your mom's just trying
to teach you to be responsible.

02:32.896 --> 02:35.866
- Cut her some slack.
- Thank you, Wendy.

02:35.867 --> 02:39.101
I, on the other hand, am the fun aunt,
so I don't have to worry about that.

02:39.102 --> 02:42.183
- And here we go.
- WENDY: What? I missed these girls.

02:42.184 --> 02:44.250
I didn't get to see
them grow up this time.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.725
So, to make up for lost years,

02:46.726 --> 02:49.032
I'm gonna give you today's
lesson free of charge.

02:49.033 --> 02:52.431
Use your magic as much as you want.
Just don't hurt anyone.

02:52.449 --> 02:54.015
Only use it in an emergency.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.852
WENDY: And...
For fun sometimes.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.204
(both scream)
(Wendy whoops)

02:59.239 --> 03:02.040
Oh, my...
(laughs)

03:02.075 --> 03:04.209
(gasping)

03:07.797 --> 03:09.865
(doorbell rings)

03:09.883 --> 03:13.298
That's Harrison.
Don't worry, I'll get it.

03:13.311 --> 03:15.461
You girls have fun.

03:25.815 --> 03:27.898
- Principal Redmond!
- Oh, hey.

03:27.899 --> 03:29.301
Today's gonna be easy.

03:29.302 --> 03:31.653
You're gonna take Principal
Redmond's deposition...

03:31.654 --> 03:33.054
And-and that's it.

03:33.072 --> 03:34.481
Okay?

03:35.325 --> 03:36.725
Thanks for picking me up.

03:36.743 --> 03:38.727
- Hi.
- The least we could do.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.666
I just thought the three of us could
go down to the courthouse together.

03:44.667 --> 03:46.618
You know, sort of
a united front.

03:46.619 --> 03:49.517
- Well, I like how you think.
- I really appreciate you doing this.

03:49.541 --> 03:51.089
Oh, please. It's my pleasure.

03:51.124 --> 03:52.825
It's insane what
they're putting you through.

03:52.848 --> 03:55.243
- I'll do anything I can to help.
- Thanks, Richard.

03:55.261 --> 03:56.461
Shall we go?

03:56.513 --> 03:58.757
Yes. Yeah.

03:59.432 --> 04:01.683
(birds chirping)

04:07.423 --> 04:09.391
(gps) Oh!

04:09.425 --> 04:11.276
(chuckling):
Hi.

04:11.311 --> 04:14.563
- I like these, surprise morning visits.
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.597 --> 04:17.933
Mmm. I'm gonna miss them once
we're living together. (chuckles)

04:22.038 --> 04:24.272
So, what was she like?

04:24.290 --> 04:26.491
Uh, who?

04:26.543 --> 04:28.781
Elyse, your ex-fiancÃ©e.

04:28.782 --> 04:31.914
Did your mom like her?
Did they get along?

04:32.049 --> 04:34.216
Is that what this is about?

04:35.301 --> 04:37.619
My mother doesn't
hate you, Freya.

04:37.637 --> 04:39.955
She doesn't like me, either.

04:40.974 --> 04:43.141
Okay...
(sighs)

04:43.176 --> 04:44.977
Look, I know my mom...

04:45.011 --> 04:48.313
I know she can be kind of difficult
to get to know.

04:48.348 --> 04:50.509
Alright? And-and, look, maybe
it's because she raised us on her own

04:50.517 --> 04:52.634
after my dad died,
so she's...

04:52.652 --> 04:55.771
She's a little overprotective.
But I know she'll come around.

04:55.805 --> 04:58.473
How could
she not love you?

04:58.491 --> 05:00.980
And please... look,
don't worry about Elyse, either.

05:00.981 --> 05:03.979
That-that was a long time ago.
She couldn't hold a candle to you.

05:03.980 --> 05:06.617
I'm not asking about Elyse
because I'm insecure.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.500
I just... I think it's weird

05:08.534 --> 05:10.619
that this was such a huge part
of your life

05:10.653 --> 05:12.874
and you've never told me
about it.

05:13.590 --> 05:16.625
I just want to put it behind me.

05:16.659 --> 05:19.044
That's it. I'm sorry.

05:19.095 --> 05:22.047
You're my family
now, Freya.

05:22.098 --> 05:24.617
I want us to be open with
each other about everything.

05:24.618 --> 05:26.167
No secrets.

05:26.185 --> 05:28.008
Okay?

05:30.523 --> 05:31.840
Exactly.

05:31.858 --> 05:34.126
No secrets.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.518
- BARB: Isn't it beautiful?
- INGRID: It's gorgeous, Barb.

05:43.536 --> 05:44.820
I know, right?

05:44.854 --> 05:47.856
This is really happening.
You guys, this is my baby.

05:47.874 --> 05:49.812
It kind of just looks
like a blob.

05:51.210 --> 05:55.414
A majestic
and extremely attractive blob.

05:55.465 --> 05:58.867
Okay, I'm gonna go
stack something.

05:58.885 --> 06:00.702
(Barb and Ingrid chuckle)

06:00.720 --> 06:04.372
Hey, you realize that this is all
happening because of you, right?

06:04.390 --> 06:08.853
- And that magic spell?
- That fake spell didn't do anything.

06:08.854 --> 06:10.899
It was the power
of positive thinking.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.132
Well, whatever it is,
this is a dream come true.

06:14.133 --> 06:17.552
And I talked to Bob,
and we want to say thanks

06:17.570 --> 06:19.387
in the only way
we could.

06:19.405 --> 06:21.523
And I know it's early,

06:21.557 --> 06:23.358
but you're like family,
Ingrid.

06:23.392 --> 06:25.410
And we'd like you
to be the baby's godmother.

06:25.445 --> 06:27.579
- Oh, my God, Barb...
- Yeah?

06:27.613 --> 06:29.230
Yes.

06:29.248 --> 06:32.233
- Thank you.
- Aw...

06:32.251 --> 06:35.403
- We are gonna spoil this kid rotten.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.421 --> 06:36.788
(both chuckle)

06:43.746 --> 06:46.765
Hello, Freya.
You can come in.

06:46.799 --> 06:48.416
Oh. Hi.

06:48.434 --> 06:50.492
I'm sorry. I-I didn't
want to bother you.

06:50.508 --> 06:52.052
You looked like
you were resting?

06:52.053 --> 06:55.783
Oh, I wish.
I-I haven't been able to sleep lately.

06:55.784 --> 06:57.776
Ever since we moved
in this house.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.262
Oh, is that Dash and Killian?

07:00.263 --> 07:02.564
Look at them.
They're so adorable.

07:02.598 --> 07:04.889
They were inseparable back then.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.102
The best of friends.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.937
But now...

07:08.955 --> 07:11.916
They grew apart. That happens
sometimes with brothers.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.943
Freya, we both know
a woman came between them.

07:14.961 --> 07:18.454
Dash mentioned that he finally told you
about his engagement to Elyse.

07:18.455 --> 07:20.236
I'm sorry you had
to find out

07:20.237 --> 07:22.334
you weren't the first woman
he was going to marry.

07:22.385 --> 07:25.087
Well, it was a long time ago.

07:25.121 --> 07:27.639
I told him he should've been
honest from the very beginning.

07:27.673 --> 07:32.184
Secrets are poison in a relationship,
don't you agree?

07:32.199 --> 07:35.061
It's really not
that big of a deal.

07:35.092 --> 07:37.099
(chuckles)

07:37.133 --> 07:41.603
It was a big enough deal
to come between my boys.

07:41.637 --> 07:46.525
Now that we're all in the same town,
I want us to be a family again.

07:46.576 --> 07:49.644
Well, Dash seems to have really
made up his mind about this.

07:49.662 --> 07:51.696
Don't be so sure, Freya.

07:51.748 --> 07:53.648
I know my son.

07:53.666 --> 07:56.334
Better than you could
ever know him.

07:56.369 --> 07:59.337
His mind can be changed.

07:59.372 --> 08:02.824
Well, I wish there was something
I could do to help.

08:02.842 --> 08:05.377
Maybe there is.

08:05.428 --> 08:07.646
What do you mean?

08:07.647 --> 08:10.382
Well, if anyone can talk
to my sons, it's you.

08:10.433 --> 08:14.386
Maybe you could convince them to come
to dinner here tonight as a first step.

08:14.387 --> 08:17.472
Oh, no, no, no. I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

08:17.506 --> 08:20.142
No, it's a perfect idea.
It's wonderful.

08:20.176 --> 08:23.361
Freya, please.

08:23.396 --> 08:25.697
It would mean the world to me.

08:25.731 --> 08:27.482
Um...

08:27.516 --> 08:30.852
Okay. I'll do my best.

08:32.038 --> 08:35.490
- INGRID: So it went well, then?
- Yeah, it went great.

08:35.524 --> 08:37.195
Principal Redmond knocked
it out of the park.

08:37.196 --> 08:38.710
It went much better
than I hoped for.

08:38.744 --> 08:40.361
Well, he was my
character witness.

08:40.379 --> 08:42.649
Of course he's gonna say
nice things about me.

08:42.664 --> 08:45.445
Still, it's important for the judge
to know what a good person you are.

08:45.468 --> 08:46.841
MAURA:
Joanna Beauchamp?

08:46.842 --> 08:48.576
How can you sit here
having lunch with your family

08:48.577 --> 08:50.578
as if everything is
normal and fine?

08:50.579 --> 08:53.758
I watched you kill my husband.
You destroyed my life.

08:53.810 --> 08:56.421
Maura, please,
that isn't what happened.

08:56.422 --> 08:58.897
- It wasn't me.
- I saw you.

08:58.931 --> 09:01.705
- You can't lie to me!
- I think you need to calm down.

09:01.706 --> 09:04.436
I will not calm down until
this woman is locked away

09:04.437 --> 09:06.387
and rotting in jail
for the rest of her life!

09:06.405 --> 09:08.240
Shut up.
(gasping)

09:08.274 --> 09:11.059
WOMAN:
Maura, what's wrong?

09:11.077 --> 09:13.778
(coughing)
I'll take care of it. Just...

09:13.830 --> 09:15.864
Get them out
of here. Go.

09:15.898 --> 09:17.532
- What just happened to her?
- HARRISON: Call 911.

09:17.566 --> 09:20.560
(coughing) Mrs. Thatcher.

09:23.906 --> 09:25.590
Wendy has got
to be more careful.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.376
Maura landing in the hospital
after a public confrontation

09:28.410 --> 09:31.118
with your family
doesn't help your case.

09:31.119 --> 09:32.914
Believe me, I gave
her an earful.

09:32.932 --> 09:34.916
But you know Wendy.
She's not exactly one to...

09:34.934 --> 09:38.220
Think before she acts, and she
was just trying to protect me.

09:38.254 --> 09:39.888
So am I, my dear.

09:39.922 --> 09:42.607
All right, so this is it.

09:42.642 --> 09:46.645
This is where Bill
Thatcher was murdered.

09:49.765 --> 09:51.733
Ooh.
(chuckles)

09:51.767 --> 09:54.189
The dark energy's palpable.

09:59.441 --> 10:01.910
What are you getting?

10:01.944 --> 10:04.329
Uh, I can feel his pain.

10:07.616 --> 10:10.802
I got her murderous intent.

10:13.556 --> 10:15.456
(exhales)

10:15.474 --> 10:17.592
It's stronger than
I thought it would be.

10:17.626 --> 10:19.311
What are you gonna do
with this energy?

10:19.345 --> 10:21.296
I'm gonna work out
the shifter's next move.

10:21.314 --> 10:23.481
- I'll be back here. Yeah.
- Mm-hm...

10:23.516 --> 10:25.300
(exhales)

10:25.318 --> 10:28.653
<i>Revelabunt tenebris nex.</i>

10:28.688 --> 10:31.439
<i>Revelabunt</i>
<i>tenebris nex.</i>

10:31.473 --> 10:34.529
<i>Revelabunt tenebris nex.</i>

10:34.530 --> 10:36.978
<i>Revelabunt</i>
<i>tenebris nex.</i>

10:36.996 --> 10:39.281
<i>Revelabunt tenebris...</i>
<i>Revelabunt tenebris nex.</i>

10:39.315 --> 10:40.949
Please...

10:40.950 --> 10:42.487
<i>Revelabunt tenebris nex.</i>

10:42.488 --> 10:44.408
Please, I know this
isn't who you are!

10:44.409 --> 10:47.352
Well, you don't know me as well
as you thought you did.

10:50.593 --> 10:52.994
(sighs)

10:54.975 --> 10:56.832
HARRISON: Are you sure
that's what you saw?

10:56.866 --> 11:00.325
Yes, the shifter's gonna kill Richard.
It happens tonight at 8:30.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.576
How do you know that?

11:01.577 --> 11:05.336
JOANNA: He was wearing the exact same
clothing he had on at the deposition,

11:05.337 --> 11:07.172
right down to the stain
on his tie.

11:07.173 --> 11:08.873
And I saw a clock.

11:09.199 --> 11:11.523
- Better get him out of there.
- Whoa, now, wait a minute.

11:11.541 --> 11:14.243
I mean, this is... this is
the perfect opportunity.

11:14.244 --> 11:17.395
We know exactly where
the shifter's going to be and when.

11:17.414 --> 11:19.708
I finally have
the upper hand.

11:19.716 --> 11:22.220
You plan on using
the principal as bait?

11:23.701 --> 11:26.670
Well, you have
any better ideas?

11:26.923 --> 11:29.708
So did you know that we could
affect people like that?

11:29.726 --> 11:32.895
INGRID: No, but I knew we could
hurt people with our powers.

11:32.929 --> 11:34.430
It's kind of scary, right?

11:34.481 --> 11:37.382
- Hey, Ingrid.
- Hey, Adam!

11:37.400 --> 11:39.018
What are you doing here?

11:39.052 --> 11:42.354
Well... I mean, you're
eating lunch, obviously.

11:42.388 --> 11:43.889
My partner's waiting
out in the car.

11:43.907 --> 11:46.424
- Ah.
- So, uh... you still on for tonight?

11:46.443 --> 11:48.694
- Definitely. 7:00, right?
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.728 --> 11:51.263
Unless you want to do 6:00.
Or we could do 8:00.

11:51.264 --> 11:54.590
- 8:30? 9:00's probably a little late.
- Okay.

11:57.058 --> 11:58.403
- Okay.
- I'll see you tonight.

11:58.421 --> 11:59.421
- Yes.
- All right.

11:59.456 --> 12:00.800
- (giggles) Freya...
- Bye.

12:02.509 --> 12:07.463
Look at you, sunshine. Your aura
is going nuclear, it's so bright.

12:07.514 --> 12:09.298
Will you stop reading me?

12:09.299 --> 12:11.100
It's like you're going
through my underwear drawer.

12:11.101 --> 12:14.121
Oh, lighten up. I'm just happy
my big sister's gettin' some.

12:14.137 --> 12:18.557
"A," lower your voice, and "B,"
all we've done is kiss so far.

12:18.591 --> 12:19.758
Give it a week.

12:19.776 --> 12:21.977
- Scratch that. A day.
- Will you stop?

12:22.028 --> 12:25.097
- I can't help it if you're in love.
- I'm not in love.

12:25.115 --> 12:28.617
Well, your words say one thing,
but your aura says another.

12:35.708 --> 12:39.828
- I can't be in love.
- Why do you seem so upset?

12:39.879 --> 12:41.964
Last time I checked,
being in love is a good thing.

12:41.998 --> 12:43.999
I'm just... I'm not.

12:44.050 --> 12:47.252
That's all. I'm not
in love with Adam.

12:47.286 --> 12:49.778
I can't be. We've
barely started dating.

12:49.789 --> 12:52.674
Okay. Okay,
whatever you say.

12:57.127 --> 13:00.265
Ugh. And now I have to go
ask someone I can't stand

13:00.299 --> 13:01.817
to have dinner with
someone he can't stand

13:01.851 --> 13:04.636
so that someone who can't stand me
will finally start to like me.

13:04.654 --> 13:06.155
Wish me luck.

13:06.189 --> 13:09.307
I have no idea what you're
talking about, but good luck.

13:09.325 --> 13:10.576
Thanks, darling.

13:15.314 --> 13:17.282
Technically, I'm still
not talking to you.

13:17.316 --> 13:18.951
I'm here on behalf
of your mom.

13:18.985 --> 13:22.121
She wants you and Dash to come
to Fair Haven for dinner tonight.

13:22.155 --> 13:23.789
Why?

13:23.823 --> 13:25.958
Because it will make
your mother happy.

13:25.992 --> 13:28.877
Why didn't she ask me herself?

13:28.928 --> 13:32.207
Because she doesn't know how
to approach you, so I said I would try.

13:33.266 --> 13:35.824
Because you think
I'd do anything for you?

13:36.622 --> 13:39.168
No, because I'm going
to be your sister-in-law,

13:39.172 --> 13:41.805
and I want you
and my husband to get along.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.026
Sorry.

13:44.060 --> 13:45.718
Can't. I have a date.

13:46.529 --> 13:49.781
- You have a date?
- That's right.

13:52.368 --> 13:54.820
Fine. Never mind.

13:54.854 --> 13:57.189
But you could've just said
that in the first place.

14:03.362 --> 14:07.858
DASH: Mrs. Thatcher, hi.
I'm Dr. Gardiner.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.551
I know who you are.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.369
If you're uncomfortable,
I can get you another doctor.

14:13.380 --> 14:17.392
But I can see you're in pain, and I think
I can help you if you'd let me.

14:17.427 --> 14:20.345
(weakly):
It hurts... right here.

14:20.379 --> 14:23.166
Okay, why don't
we take a look.

14:23.181 --> 14:25.716
(coughs)

14:26.234 --> 14:29.513
(whispers):
Okay. Let's open up.

14:32.775 --> 14:36.245
Uh, I'm gonna need you
to stay very still.

14:36.279 --> 14:38.163
Okay?

14:43.402 --> 14:45.420
All right, don't move.

14:45.455 --> 14:47.256
Don't move.

14:49.175 --> 14:50.592
(low groan)

14:50.627 --> 14:53.476
(Maura clears throat softly)

14:58.518 --> 15:02.304
- It... it feels better.
- Good.

15:02.355 --> 15:05.924
Good. I'm just gonna apply
a topical anesthetic.

15:05.942 --> 15:09.637
I think we should keep you overnight
for observation, just in case.

15:13.266 --> 15:16.568
(birds chirping)

15:16.602 --> 15:18.787
âª

15:26.963 --> 15:28.163
(sighs)

15:28.164 --> 15:29.715
(typing)

15:36.139 --> 15:37.839
(sighs) (typing)

15:41.127 --> 15:42.144
Mmm.

15:42.178 --> 15:43.679
FREYA:
Hey, are you busy?

15:43.730 --> 15:46.515
I need some help.
Is there a spell we can do

15:46.566 --> 15:49.017
to make Dash forgive Killian
for sleeping with his fiancÃ©e?

15:49.068 --> 15:52.137
- You slept with Killian?
- No, no. His other fiancÃ©e.

15:52.155 --> 15:55.107
- Dash has another fiancÃ©e?
- He did, a long time ago.

15:55.141 --> 15:57.442
And Killian slept with her,
and now they hate each other.

15:57.476 --> 16:00.028
So, how do I use my powers
to bring them together?

16:00.079 --> 16:02.013
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

16:02.014 --> 16:03.999
It isn't for me;
it's for Dash's mom.

16:04.033 --> 16:05.667
Ooh. Kiss-ass, huh?

16:05.702 --> 16:08.370
Hey, I'm gonna have to live with
the woman, it would help if we got along.

16:08.421 --> 16:11.290
Okay, so you want a spell to make
the boys forgive each other.

16:11.324 --> 16:12.534
That's a really tall order.

16:12.535 --> 16:14.568
You change the way
someone feels about one thing,

16:14.569 --> 16:16.845
you risk changing how they
feel about other things.

16:16.879 --> 16:19.214
Maybe even including
how Dash feels about you.

16:19.265 --> 16:21.084
I don't think you want
to mess with that.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.336
How about a spell to just get them
to come to dinner tonight?

16:24.354 --> 16:28.168
Oh, a beacon spell...
No problem, my friend.

16:28.184 --> 16:31.310
We just need to get
you some supplies.

16:31.344 --> 16:35.030
âª

16:35.064 --> 16:36.982
His assistant said
he should be headed home.

16:37.016 --> 16:40.319
Wow, I left him three voice mails,
and he still hasn't called back.

16:40.353 --> 16:43.322
- Think we're too late?
- No, the clock said 8:30.

16:43.356 --> 16:45.023
REDMOND:
Joanna.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.459
- JOANNA: Hi.
- Hey.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.748
(sighs)

16:54.083 --> 16:55.717
(cat meows)

16:55.752 --> 16:58.837
Well, hello, kitty.
Who do you belong to?

16:58.871 --> 17:01.089
(cat meows)

17:01.140 --> 17:02.758
(meows)

17:04.377 --> 17:06.560
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

17:09.265 --> 17:11.266
(cat yowls)

17:12.318 --> 17:14.069
(soft gasp)

17:14.103 --> 17:15.720
Wow.

17:15.738 --> 17:17.776
Howdy, neighbor.

17:19.736 --> 17:22.154
Sorry about that. I didn't
mean to scare you.

17:22.189 --> 17:26.141
(chuckles) Oh. No, no, that's quite
all right. I'm nude... er, good.

17:26.159 --> 17:28.160
(nervous chuckle)

17:29.186 --> 17:32.405
Oh, uh, right, come on in.
I'll get you some clothes.

17:34.317 --> 17:37.862
I just moved in upstairs, and
I was about to take a shower...

17:37.863 --> 17:42.116
I accidentally left the front door open,
and my cat ran out, so I chased after her,

17:42.150 --> 17:46.588
and now I'm locked out...
no keys, no cat, no clothes.

17:46.893 --> 17:49.316
Well, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

17:49.317 --> 17:50.875
I'm sure the super
will be back soon.

17:50.876 --> 17:52.760
Are you sure?
I don't want to impose.

17:52.761 --> 17:56.847
Nah. Nah, I'm just...
doing my part to be neighborly.

17:56.882 --> 17:59.205
- I'm Wendy, by the way.
- Leo. My name's Leo.

17:59.221 --> 18:01.764
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

18:02.525 --> 18:05.389
Oh, I almost forgot.
Your cat.

18:05.390 --> 18:07.000
Do you want to go
look for her?

18:07.001 --> 18:09.111
Oh, no, she's fine.

18:09.112 --> 18:11.614
She's a very clever kitty.

18:13.469 --> 18:15.282
You guys really didn't
have to cook me dinner.

18:15.283 --> 18:18.177
Oh, that's no big deal.
Joanna can work magic...

18:18.178 --> 18:21.071
With a box of pasta
and a well-stocked refrigerator.

18:21.122 --> 18:23.741
Well, it was the least
that we could do

18:23.792 --> 18:26.210
after you gave such
wonderful testimony today.

18:26.244 --> 18:30.030
Well... (clears throat) thank you again
for the lovely meal.

18:30.048 --> 18:33.334
Uh... Uh, no, no, no,
Joanna, I-I insist.

18:33.368 --> 18:35.563
You cooked;
it's the least I can do.

18:35.564 --> 18:37.693
Uh, Richard,
I hate to impose.

18:37.694 --> 18:40.090
Is there any way that
I could have a cup of tea?

18:40.141 --> 18:42.376
I really, I think
I'm coming down with something.

18:42.394 --> 18:44.011
Uh, sure, no problem.

18:44.045 --> 18:46.717
- We'll have it in the living room.
- Great.

18:46.718 --> 18:48.719
(whispers):
Nice one.

18:50.602 --> 18:53.737
(whispers): How are we going
to stall him for another half an hour?

18:53.738 --> 18:57.464
No, don't worry about it. You should go.
It's too dangerous for you here.

18:57.465 --> 19:00.315
No, I'm not gonna leave you alone
to fight the shifter. Come on.

19:00.316 --> 19:03.480
You seem to forget,
I'm a very powerful witch.

19:11.209 --> 19:13.684
REDMOND: Please, please,
I know this isn't who you are.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.727
You don't know me
as well as you thought you did.

19:16.728 --> 19:17.928
(grunts)

19:18.978 --> 19:20.414
Hey, Joanna...

19:20.415 --> 19:23.627
We're defin... we're
definitely in the right place.

19:25.550 --> 19:29.007
We just have to give
tonight a new ending.

19:29.357 --> 19:31.392
ADAM: Just a couple more steps.
One...

19:31.426 --> 19:34.061
and... last one.

19:34.095 --> 19:36.176
All right, now we're
gonna go over here.

19:36.177 --> 19:39.262
Keep those eyes closed.
No peeking.

19:41.987 --> 19:43.954
Okay, uh...

19:43.989 --> 19:46.123
Open your eyes.

19:52.634 --> 19:55.681
Oh, Adam.

19:55.834 --> 19:58.285
Barb gave me the keys
so I could set up.

19:58.303 --> 20:03.123
See? I can chase down bank
robbers and be a romantic.

20:03.141 --> 20:06.093
Seriously? You've actually
chased a bank robber?

20:06.127 --> 20:08.512
No, no, but I have
arrested a drunk guy

20:08.563 --> 20:11.098
for trying to dismantle
an ATM with a corkscrew.

20:11.132 --> 20:13.608
That's pretty cool, too.

20:13.609 --> 20:15.476
And I cooked.

20:15.477 --> 20:16.995
Sandwiches.

20:16.996 --> 20:18.630
Which I guess you
don't really cook.

20:18.631 --> 20:21.099
So let's just say
I bought sandwiches.

20:21.526 --> 20:24.194
But it's the-the thought
that counts, right?

20:24.245 --> 20:26.163
It's beautiful.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.316
I can't do this.

20:29.334 --> 20:31.318
What? What, dinner?

20:31.336 --> 20:35.289
No. It's just, my life
is really complicated right now,

20:35.323 --> 20:37.658
and I don't want you
to get hurt.

20:37.676 --> 20:39.754
I think I just need some time.

20:39.755 --> 20:42.459
Wait, wait, wait, wai... What?

20:42.497 --> 20:44.181
I really care about you.

20:44.215 --> 20:46.967
So, you're gonna
break up with me?

20:47.001 --> 20:50.003
Not that we can even break up. I mean,
we've barely gone out. I just...

20:50.021 --> 20:52.172
I don't... Ingrid,
what-what...

20:52.190 --> 20:54.525
What happened? Did...

20:54.559 --> 20:56.176
Did I do something wrong?

20:56.194 --> 20:59.110
No. No, it's me.
It's my fault. I just...

21:00.231 --> 21:03.016
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

21:03.034 --> 21:04.535
I can't handle it.

21:04.569 --> 21:06.236
- I'm so sorry.
- In-Ingrid...

21:11.576 --> 21:14.027
(Adam sighs heavily)

21:19.084 --> 21:22.886
FREYA: <i>Fratres divisique.</i>

21:22.921 --> 21:25.872
<i>Praegero coaptandas.</i>

21:28.810 --> 21:31.513
I hope this works, Wendy.

21:35.483 --> 21:39.403
<i>Fratres divisique.</i>

21:39.437 --> 21:42.856
<i>Praegero coaptandas.</i>

21:42.890 --> 21:45.058
It worked! (laughs)

21:45.076 --> 21:49.029
Wait. What?
Don't go away.

21:49.063 --> 21:51.031
No, no, no, no, no, don't go.

21:51.065 --> 21:52.899
No.

21:52.917 --> 21:54.418
What?!

21:54.452 --> 21:55.902
WENDY:
Oh!

21:55.920 --> 21:59.880
Wow! Look at the colors.
This blue one is especially gorgeous.

21:59.906 --> 22:02.743
LEO: If you like that one, I got
something you're gonna love.

22:02.761 --> 22:04.928
Okay.

22:05.649 --> 22:07.233
(gasps) Wow.

22:07.234 --> 22:08.582
That's the...

22:08.600 --> 22:11.918
The jewel of my collection...
Himalayan Stamped Crown.

22:11.936 --> 22:14.417
Oh, it's so unusual.

22:14.418 --> 22:17.424
The intensity of the color,
the way that it shimmers.

22:17.442 --> 22:19.116
I caught it myself.

22:19.117 --> 22:22.062
Trekked all the way to Kabru Mountain
in Nepal just to find her.

22:22.063 --> 22:23.959
That's one of the rarest
butterflies in the world.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.192
- Really?
- Some people even say it has...

22:27.483 --> 22:29.511
Enchanted properties.

22:29.537 --> 22:31.572
You don't believe
in that kind of stuff, do you?

22:31.606 --> 22:37.294
No, not usually, but catching this beauty
was definitely a spiritual experience.

22:37.328 --> 22:39.663
It was one of those
rare moments in life

22:39.714 --> 22:42.282
where you almost believe
magic is real.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.312
I think I know what you mean.

22:44.515 --> 22:47.304
So, you're kind of
like Indiana Jones.

22:47.338 --> 22:49.757
Only with a butterfly net
instead of a whip.

22:49.791 --> 22:52.309
(both laugh)

22:52.310 --> 22:55.500
(sighs)
Oh! Man.

22:55.797 --> 22:58.816
- Would you please excuse me?
- Yeah.

23:06.641 --> 23:09.334
Wait. You're leaving already?

23:13.832 --> 23:16.533
I could stay
for a few more minutes.

23:16.584 --> 23:20.370
You were just gonna go
without saying good-bye?

23:21.467 --> 23:23.931
I'm not very good at good-byes.

23:24.008 --> 23:26.426
I'm much better at hellos.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.668
Well, hello, bug guy.

23:37.358 --> 23:39.223
- HARRISON: What do we do?
- We wait.

23:39.274 --> 23:40.641
That's it?

23:40.675 --> 23:42.476
(sighs) Yeah.

23:42.510 --> 23:44.528
Okay, I'm gonna check the
house out, all right? Just...

23:44.562 --> 23:45.931
- No.
- Just...

24:14.709 --> 24:17.060
âª

24:36.564 --> 24:38.999
Oh, boy.

24:40.785 --> 24:42.836
(door creaks open)

24:49.427 --> 24:51.411
Hello?

24:51.429 --> 24:53.430
Anyone here?

24:53.464 --> 24:57.140
(piano plays
gentle classical music)

25:24.829 --> 25:27.447
(stops playing)

25:27.465 --> 25:30.998
- Hi.
- Hey. You came.

25:31.636 --> 25:33.837
Canceled my date.

25:33.888 --> 25:36.340
Thought, why not?
Make Mom happy.

25:36.391 --> 25:38.458
I didn't know you played.

25:38.476 --> 25:41.645
I... It's been a while.

25:41.679 --> 25:45.315
Where is that piece from?
I know I've heard it somewhere.

25:45.350 --> 25:47.851
I don't see how.
I wrote it.

25:47.902 --> 25:50.771
- Seriously?
- Don't look so shocked, all right?

25:50.805 --> 25:53.640
There's more to me than just
phenomenal bartending skills.

25:53.658 --> 25:56.777
Yeah, apparently so.
That was really good.

25:56.811 --> 26:00.146
- You could play professionally.
- I used to think so a long time ago.

26:00.164 --> 26:04.167
Then I broke my hand, and after that,
I was never able to play the same again.

26:04.202 --> 26:06.503
I have bad luck that way.

26:06.537 --> 26:08.900
Well, you still
play beautifully.

26:11.457 --> 26:13.240
Thanks.

26:17.682 --> 26:20.300
Your brother should
be here soon.

26:20.334 --> 26:21.874
I'm hoping.

26:21.875 --> 26:24.917
And on that note, why don't I
track down a bottle of wine?

26:24.939 --> 26:27.057
- Mmm.
- Think I could use a glass.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.705
(playing same tune)

26:42.837 --> 26:44.487
(gasps)

26:44.709 --> 26:46.493
(sighs)

26:46.527 --> 26:49.195
Oh, hey, baby.

26:49.213 --> 26:51.865
- You came.
- Yeah, of course.

26:51.883 --> 26:55.220
I'm not ready to forgive Killian,
but I'll do this for you and Mom.

26:55.221 --> 26:57.234
FREYA: Thanks, babe.
You're the best.

26:57.247 --> 26:59.532
Mmm.

27:03.928 --> 27:06.379
I... I just don't get it,

27:06.397 --> 27:09.049
'cause I thought you said
everything was going so well.

27:09.067 --> 27:12.769
- Can we please change the subject?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's okay by me.

27:12.770 --> 27:15.889
You know, you call the shots,
and tonight is all about you.

27:15.907 --> 27:17.891
I'm just saying,
I don't get it.

27:17.909 --> 27:21.061
There's nothing to get.
It just wasn't worth it.

27:21.079 --> 27:23.580
You waited all those years,
and it wasn't worth it?

27:23.614 --> 27:25.723
I mean, come on,
this guy is perfect.

27:25.724 --> 27:27.567
I don't even think
he has one flaw.

27:27.585 --> 27:29.870
- Oh, you're right, he is perfect.
- Oh, yeah.

27:29.904 --> 27:33.957
And that's why I didn't want to risk it.
This way, no one gets hurt.

27:33.958 --> 27:36.267
So you're hurting yourself
so you won't get hurt?

27:36.318 --> 27:39.245
- That makes no sense.
- I wish I could explain it.

27:39.263 --> 27:41.932
It's-it's just
better this way.

27:42.113 --> 27:44.414
Okay. Uh, you need a drink.

27:44.415 --> 27:45.719
You do.

27:45.753 --> 27:47.971
So, Bent Elbow,
here we come?

27:48.022 --> 27:49.923
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? Okay.

27:49.941 --> 27:52.108
(groans, yells) Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

27:52.109 --> 27:54.327
- Barbie, are you okay? Oh, my...
- Oh, no, no, no.

27:54.328 --> 27:57.868
Call an ambulance!
(loud breathing) Oh, no!

27:57.869 --> 28:00.428
No, God! No!

28:01.375 --> 28:03.756
(crickets chirping)

28:09.877 --> 28:13.209
I'm sorry. I have to go. I thought
I could do this. I can't. I can't do this.

28:13.210 --> 28:15.161
No. Your mom is on
the way. Please stay.

28:15.162 --> 28:17.330
I can't watch you with him.

28:19.429 --> 28:21.573
It hurts too much.

28:22.149 --> 28:23.716
DASH: So what are we
gonna do for dinner?

28:23.734 --> 28:27.641
Uh, your mom is picking up
Michelangelo's on the way home.

28:27.642 --> 28:29.756
Yeah. That's her idea
of a home-cooked meal.

28:29.757 --> 28:31.157
PENELOPE:
I heard that!

28:31.158 --> 28:33.860
At least I know how
to pick a good restaurant.

28:36.069 --> 28:37.999
I don't know how
you pulled it off,

28:38.000 --> 28:41.286
but I'm so glad to see
the two of you in one place.

28:41.287 --> 28:44.256
Oh, come here. Oh.

28:44.290 --> 28:47.642
Actually, I was just, uh...
I was just leaving.

28:47.677 --> 28:50.556
- Oh, no. Killian.
- Sorry to hear.

28:50.557 --> 28:53.469
Yeah, well, I wish I could stay,
but I have a date.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.391
A date?
Well, can't you reschedule that?

28:55.392 --> 28:58.521
(phone ringing) KILLIAN: Let me buy you
lunch tomorrow to make it up to you.

28:58.522 --> 29:00.309
- Mmm.
- I missed you, Mom.

29:00.310 --> 29:01.913
I missed you, too.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.526
I have to take a rain check, too.
They need me back at the hospital.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.282
Oh, for God's sake.
I'm a mother without children.

29:07.290 --> 29:10.009
- Dramatic as always.
- Oh.

29:10.274 --> 29:12.450
Sorry, baby.
I'll call you later.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.923
- You two have a nice dinner.
- Yeah.

29:14.941 --> 29:17.303
- DASH: Mom. Okay.
- PENELOPE: Mmm.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.208
(sighs)

29:20.259 --> 29:22.127
Yeah.

29:22.128 --> 29:25.157
Well, I guess
it's just the two of us.

29:34.506 --> 29:35.857
Richard?

29:35.891 --> 29:37.842
Is your clock broken?

29:37.860 --> 29:39.844
Richard?

29:46.108 --> 29:47.694
Richard...?

29:53.859 --> 29:55.860
Richard...

29:59.198 --> 30:01.395
Harrison...?

30:08.591 --> 30:10.075
Harrison...

30:10.727 --> 30:14.376
Redmond! (gasping)

30:15.463 --> 30:20.435
Harrison, we're too late.
The shifter's already killed Redmond.

30:20.436 --> 30:22.187
- Richard?
- <i>Agedum!</i>

30:22.221 --> 30:25.352
(groaning)

30:34.394 --> 30:39.266
Well, I guess you found
Principal Redmond.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.620
Vidar...?

30:43.759 --> 30:46.744
It's been a long time, Joanna.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.905
(gasping)

30:54.470 --> 30:56.587
This time, I came prepared.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.891
(gasping)

31:29.288 --> 31:32.790
I'm sorry your family get-together
didn't turn out the way you wanted.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.844
- I did try.
- And I do appreciate it...

31:35.895 --> 31:38.868
But I may have been
asking too much of you.

31:42.184 --> 31:45.455
Well, it seems like things
will get better with Killian.

31:46.489 --> 31:51.080
With Killian... everything
is always a struggle.

31:51.081 --> 31:53.478
I just wish I could have done more
to help when I had the chance.

31:53.496 --> 31:56.968
I'm sure he understands.
I was a bit of a rebel myself.

31:56.969 --> 32:00.224
Drove my mother crazy,
but I don't hold it against her.

32:00.225 --> 32:01.953
He just had so
much potential.

32:01.987 --> 32:06.157
I mean, he had the best schools begging
for him to apply, so what does he do?

32:06.175 --> 32:09.961
Two weeks before the auditions, he breaks
his hand in a drunken bar fight.

32:09.962 --> 32:13.282
Killian's afraid
of being happy.

32:13.509 --> 32:16.718
It's why he's run away from
anyone who ever loved him,

32:16.769 --> 32:18.545
including me.

32:18.775 --> 32:21.494
Well, I hope he stays
around here for a while.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.391
For you.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.188
(sighs)

32:39.387 --> 32:40.973
Hey...

32:41.496 --> 32:43.029
How is she?

32:43.063 --> 32:46.917
She's in surgery.
That's all I know.

32:46.951 --> 32:49.870
I can't get in touch with Bob...
he's still out of town...

32:49.904 --> 32:52.572
But, God, Hudson,
this is all my fault.

32:52.590 --> 32:55.709
Your fault? No, how can
this be your fault?

32:55.743 --> 32:58.244
You got her to the hospital
as quickly as you could.

32:58.262 --> 33:00.347
You probably saved
her life, Ingrid.

33:06.137 --> 33:10.023
I don't know what I'll do
if something happens to her.

33:14.261 --> 33:16.262
(owl hoots)

33:19.951 --> 33:23.537
I've waited a long time
for this, Joanna.

33:26.607 --> 33:29.256
I'll be sure to take my time.

33:32.797 --> 33:34.130
(panting)

33:34.165 --> 33:37.784
Why don't we start
with your ear?

33:39.170 --> 33:40.987
(sizzling)
(Joanna screams)

33:47.293 --> 33:51.521
Tonight, the Beauchamp
family line ends.

33:51.522 --> 33:53.356
It'd be sad...

33:54.610 --> 33:56.855
...if you didn't all deserve it.

34:22.395 --> 34:25.833
No, please, please,
I'm begging you, no.

34:25.835 --> 34:27.052
(groans)

34:27.434 --> 34:29.617
Please spare me.

34:31.382 --> 34:32.715
Please...

34:32.716 --> 34:34.715
Please, I know
this isn't who you are.

34:34.716 --> 34:37.438
Well, you don't know me
as well as you thought you did.

34:37.438 --> 34:38.672
(groans)

34:38.690 --> 34:43.148
I will protect my family
at all costs, and this ends now.

34:43.149 --> 34:45.379
No, it doesn't.

34:45.522 --> 34:48.199
I'm not the one
who framed you for murder.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.547
- Your real enemy is still out there.
- Who is it?

34:51.847 --> 34:53.743
Who's the shifter?

34:53.744 --> 34:56.991
More will be summoned
to replace me.

34:57.706 --> 35:00.538
Where are they coming from?
Why is it happening?

35:00.563 --> 35:02.563
You won't win...

35:03.169 --> 35:05.228
Who is it?

35:07.755 --> 35:09.089
(Vidar gasps)

35:09.123 --> 35:11.908
Joanna... hey.

35:14.415 --> 35:17.630
Hey. Shh.

35:17.631 --> 35:19.632
(piano playing)

35:25.306 --> 35:27.895
(stops playing)

35:27.896 --> 35:29.313
That's pretty.

35:29.314 --> 35:33.785
Well, you know, I did play the piano
for six whole months when I was 12.

35:33.786 --> 35:35.953
(laughs)

35:35.954 --> 35:38.249
Your mom and I had
a very nice dinner tonight.

35:38.283 --> 35:41.953
I would say there was a little bit
of progress in our relationship.

35:42.004 --> 35:44.277
See, I knew you didn't have
a thing to worry about.

35:44.289 --> 35:45.590
You're extremely lovable.

35:45.624 --> 35:46.591
(chuckles)

35:46.625 --> 35:49.377
And she's cool, you know.

35:49.411 --> 35:53.581
Once you get to know her, she's a...
A little bit less intimidating.

35:53.599 --> 35:57.125
She's just a mom
who cares for her sons.

36:00.806 --> 36:04.196
You know, I-I didn't like seeing
Killian in my house tonight.

36:04.199 --> 36:06.482
I mean, I hate the fact
that he's even in town,

36:06.516 --> 36:10.668
but I appreciate you going
to all this trouble for my mom.

36:10.699 --> 36:13.522
The way you are with her... it just
shows me how much you love me.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.408
I do love you so much.

36:16.459 --> 36:18.460
I know.

36:25.752 --> 36:27.035
You want to go to bed?

36:27.435 --> 36:28.635
Yeah.

36:28.636 --> 36:30.637
(both chuckle)

36:32.875 --> 36:35.210
(siren wailing in distance)

36:37.931 --> 36:40.967
<i>Revive papilio.</i>

36:50.109 --> 36:52.110
(gasps)

36:58.918 --> 37:00.919
Hello?

37:05.606 --> 37:08.671
(thunder rumbling)

37:08.672 --> 37:12.807
(crying): Wendy, I'm at the hospital.
I just talked to the doctor.

37:12.808 --> 37:15.115
Barb's in surgery,
she's lost a lot of blood,

37:15.116 --> 37:17.410
and they don't think
the baby's going to make it,

37:17.411 --> 37:19.491
and it's... it's my fault.

37:19.492 --> 37:21.961
(thunder cracks) How can I look
her in the eye after this?

37:21.995 --> 37:23.385
I did this to her.

37:23.386 --> 37:27.587
Barb is paying the price
for the spell I cast, and...

37:28.002 --> 37:30.670
(siren wailing)

37:30.671 --> 37:32.717
No!

37:34.007 --> 37:36.008
ADAM:
Ingrid!

37:37.010 --> 37:39.021
Adam.

37:39.218 --> 37:42.671
I heard about Barb,
came as soon as I could.

37:45.686 --> 37:48.966
I'm sorry I was such
a jerk earlier.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.706
Oh, no, no, no,
you weren't a jerk.

37:50.707 --> 37:53.318
You were just scared, all right?
I was moving too fast.

37:53.319 --> 37:56.842
No, I just... I freaked out,
but it-it's not your fault.

37:56.843 --> 38:00.549
- I'm just really screwed up right now.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...

38:00.584 --> 38:04.387
Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay, it's okay.

38:05.734 --> 38:07.735
It's okay.

38:29.931 --> 38:31.932
(phone ringing)

38:36.607 --> 38:38.353
Hello...?

38:38.354 --> 38:39.988
Yes.

38:41.410 --> 38:43.048
Yes...!

38:43.606 --> 38:46.475
Oh, my God,
that's great news.

38:46.509 --> 38:48.360
Tell her I'll be right back.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.562
(laughing):
Barb's okay.

38:50.613 --> 38:54.312
The baby's fine.
Everything's going to be okay.

38:54.313 --> 38:55.947
Well, that's fantastic.

38:55.981 --> 38:59.734
Adam, your nose
is bleeding.

38:59.768 --> 39:02.236
Huh?

39:02.270 --> 39:04.238
(groans)

39:04.272 --> 39:07.909
Adam! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Adam!

39:07.943 --> 39:09.143
Adam!

39:09.161 --> 39:11.295
Help!

39:11.330 --> 39:12.580
Somebody, help!

39:12.614 --> 39:13.998
Adam?

39:14.049 --> 39:15.796
Adam, come back!

39:15.797 --> 39:17.780
(sobbing): Come back,
come back, come back!

39:17.786 --> 39:18.986
MAN:
Give us room.

39:25.051 --> 39:26.477
No vitals.

39:26.511 --> 39:27.711
(panting)

39:31.633 --> 39:33.601
(sobbing)

39:33.635 --> 39:36.343

We lost him.
