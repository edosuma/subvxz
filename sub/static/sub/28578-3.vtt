WEBVTT

00:07.261 --> 00:08.633
Madame Speaker!

00:08.676 --> 00:12.433
We need to open an impeachment
inquiry into President Trump!

00:12.521 --> 00:14.072
- Damn it!
- The Mueller Report showed

00:14.144 --> 00:15.986
clear evidence
he obstructed justice,

00:16.074 --> 00:19.322
and now he refuses to comply
with a single subpoena, honey.

00:19.410 --> 00:22.236
Sorry, but the focus groups
don't want impeachment.

00:22.324 --> 00:24.391
And Americans
never change their minds.

00:24.478 --> 00:28.141
That's why Ricki Lake is still
the queen of daytime TV!

00:28.228 --> 00:31.516
Senator Elizabeth Warren here,
out of breath as always.

00:31.603 --> 00:34.391
Can anyone just walk
into the House Chamber?

00:34.478 --> 00:35.894
I want to lend my voice

00:35.982 --> 00:38.556
to the chorus of voices
calling for impeachment.

00:38.644 --> 00:40.474
Sounds great.
Eat shit. Byeee!

00:40.562 --> 00:42.222
It's the right thing
to do!

00:42.310 --> 00:44.455
Look, I'd love
to do impeachment,

00:44.543 --> 00:47.475
but I have to compete in the
Goodwill Games tomorrow, so...

00:47.562 --> 00:49.516
Nancy, they don't
do those anymore.

00:49.603 --> 00:50.886
I have to go...

00:50.974 --> 00:53.619
I just heard the sun and moon
are switchin' places!

00:53.707 --> 00:55.974
If that's true, the birds
would be going nuts.

00:56.061 --> 00:58.516
Uhp! We just lost the lease
on Capitol Hill.

00:58.603 --> 01:00.847
Just impeach him,
you stubborn bastard!

01:00.935 --> 01:04.598
We can't impeach him
because I love him!

01:04.686 --> 01:07.515
Nancy, I know he's hot,
but he's with Melania now.

01:07.603 --> 01:09.861
What am I even saying?
I'm trying to impeach him,

01:09.949 --> 01:11.660
but no one here
will let me!

01:11.748 --> 01:13.411
Madame Speaker, if I may...

01:13.527 --> 01:15.932
we must put the Constitution
over polls,

01:16.020 --> 01:17.816
justice over expediency,

01:17.904 --> 01:19.849
and let it be known
to future generations

01:19.937 --> 01:23.902
that, in America, no honey
is above the law, honey!

01:24.011 --> 01:26.761
Next up, Game of Thrones
written by women!

01:26.849 --> 01:28.720
Okay, I've heard enough.

01:28.850 --> 01:32.929
Now I understand that I must
rise to this moment in history,

01:33.017 --> 01:35.455
honor my oath
to the Constitution,

01:35.543 --> 01:37.776
and get the eff
out of here!

01:41.613 --> 01:44.840
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm still not budging.

01:44.927 --> 01:46.816
<font color=#FF00FF>*OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02  Episode 03</font>

01:46.904 --> 01:49.433
There are good letters
on both sides.

01:49.629 --> 01:52.519
Episode Title :<font color=#FFFF00>"Culture War"</font>

01:54.761 --> 01:57.600
Ahhh, there's nothing better
than home TV

01:57.687 --> 02:00.099
after a long day
of work TV.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.340
Even better...
Nerd Hannity is on!

02:02.442 --> 02:03.896
Tonight on Tucker Carlson...

02:03.997 --> 02:07.869
our economy was founded by men
for men to make more men.

02:07.965 --> 02:10.377
So why are women
still producing daughters?

02:10.466 --> 02:13.019
Just to be annoying?
We'll investigate after this.

02:13.107 --> 02:14.687
Hey. It's Common.

02:14.777 --> 02:17.136
Child detention,
white supremacy.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.679
President Trump
has destroyed this nation,

02:19.793 --> 02:21.332
but from the ashes,

02:21.420 --> 02:24.375
we... will... rise.

02:24.553 --> 02:26.549
A message from
Yummy Time Pizza.

02:26.778 --> 02:30.191
Tell SEAL Team Six to capture
Yummy Time Pizza's CEO.

02:30.279 --> 02:33.189
Remember... any loss of pizza
is considered a loss of life.

02:33.277 --> 02:35.457
Relax, Dad.
It's just a pizza place.

02:35.545 --> 02:37.666
Wrong.
It's a pizza business,

02:37.764 --> 02:39.594
and I'm the pro-business
President.

02:39.682 --> 02:42.217
Corporations are
supposed to be my friends.

02:42.305 --> 02:44.427
Well, at least
you still got me, Dad.

02:44.515 --> 02:46.777
Way to kick a man
when he's down, Don.

02:48.407 --> 02:51.056
At least I still got some
pro-Trump businesses...

02:51.144 --> 02:53.808
Hobby Lobby, NASCAR,
Lizard Wholesalers.

02:53.895 --> 02:56.136
Actually, Lizard Wholesalers
switched sides

02:56.224 --> 02:58.478
when you dug that mass grave
and refused to say why.

02:58.566 --> 02:59.892
Ugh! It's hopeless.

02:59.979 --> 03:03.910
And to think, me and business
used to be best friends...

03:04.086 --> 03:06.090
The year was 2017,

03:06.178 --> 03:10.390
and I had not one, but two
business advisory councils.

03:10.478 --> 03:12.558
Boy, did we have some laughs.

03:12.646 --> 03:14.884
"Ohh, I'm the rainforest.

03:14.972 --> 03:17.093
Businesses are
chopping me down."

03:17.228 --> 03:19.027
Shut up!

03:20.579 --> 03:24.176
But seriously, whatever
you want to do is hella cool.

03:24.437 --> 03:27.600
And then all I said was
"I likey the Nazis,"

03:27.687 --> 03:31.498
and, suddenly,
my business friends were gone.

03:32.228 --> 03:34.308
I've done so much
for businesses...

03:34.395 --> 03:35.558
Giving tax breaks,

03:35.645 --> 03:38.350
saying factories no longer
need more than one exit...

03:38.437 --> 03:41.725
And still Nike, Gillette,
and now Yummy Time Pizza

03:41.812 --> 03:42.850
don't have my back.

03:42.937 --> 03:45.850
Sir, don't give up.
Now about we have Mike Pence

03:45.937 --> 03:48.105
do what he did with the NFL
and apply pressure

03:48.193 --> 03:50.141
with a taxpayer-funded
toothless protest?

03:50.228 --> 03:51.808
It's the only thing
he's good at,

03:51.895 --> 03:53.779
besides entering
a room unnoticed.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.459
Oh, my God!
Good idea.

03:55.547 --> 03:58.090
Mike, go out there and make
a pitiful ass of yourself

03:58.178 --> 03:59.474
so I can save face.

03:59.562 --> 04:01.967
When I hear the words
"pitiful A-S-S,"

04:02.055 --> 04:04.426
I know it's my time
to shine!

04:05.131 --> 04:08.092
Now, remember, Karen, we're
going to order the pizza,

04:08.180 --> 04:10.552
pay for the pizza, and
then leave the pizza.

04:10.640 --> 04:13.719
It's like I'm in a play!
Oooohh!

04:13.895 --> 04:16.558
We'd like one pizza with
the pepperonis spelling,

04:16.644 --> 04:18.391
"I support
our President."

04:18.478 --> 04:21.896
What's my line? I forgot
my line! Line!

04:21.983 --> 04:24.734
- Uh, we don't do that here.
- Oh, my!

04:24.822 --> 04:26.112
Karen, gasp.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.326
That was Vice President Pence
and Second Lady Karen before

04:33.414 --> 04:35.724
she had to be re-oxygenated
at a local hospital.

04:35.812 --> 04:37.490
The event has sparked
a viral trend

04:37.578 --> 04:38.631
among Trump supporters

04:38.719 --> 04:40.964
who have been flushing
Yummy Time pizzas,

04:41.052 --> 04:42.093
clogging their own plumbing,

04:42.180 --> 04:43.693
and hurting no one
but themselves.

04:43.781 --> 04:44.860
Mom?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.527
Tonight, I'll be reading

04:46.615 --> 04:47.890
New York District Court
transcripts

04:47.977 --> 04:49.653
that you'll listen to
tomorrow in the shower

04:49.740 --> 04:51.865
from your iPhone propped up
on top of the toilet.

04:51.953 --> 04:54.449
But first,
Vice President Joe Biden

04:54.562 --> 04:56.381
is here for
"The Interview."

04:56.469 --> 04:59.543
Rachel, God love ya,
if only I was ten years younger

04:59.631 --> 05:01.371
and your hair was
ten inches longer.

05:01.459 --> 05:03.016
I'm being told
your campaign manager

05:03.103 --> 05:04.842
is trying to unplug
the studio.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.693
Now, how will you unite
the fractured Democratic Party?

05:07.781 --> 05:09.028
- Because...
- Sorry to interrupt, honey,

05:09.115 --> 05:10.982
but the Democrats
aren't fractured.

05:11.070 --> 05:13.807
We're unified behind
my optimistic vision

05:13.895 --> 05:16.558
of lowering taxes,
ending welfare again,

05:16.645 --> 05:19.068
and sending pot dealers
to the death house!

05:19.156 --> 05:22.162
Actually, Cory Booker talks
about criminal-justice reform,

05:22.250 --> 05:24.265
and Elizabeth Warren
pledged to tax the rich.

05:24.353 --> 05:26.037
Oh, they'll come
to their senses.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.996
Hey, billionaires
gotta eat, too.

05:28.084 --> 05:30.576
Now, how 'bout a hug?
Wow. You are bad at this.

05:33.256 --> 05:35.740
Companies
would be crazy to get political

05:35.828 --> 05:38.575
after Pence went beast mode
on Yummy Time Pizza.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.350
We believe
all people are created equal.

05:41.437 --> 05:42.808
Seafood Shack.

05:42.895 --> 05:45.709
When others build
walls, we build community.

05:45.797 --> 05:47.293
Tire Supply Liquidators.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.459
Democracy is in peril,

05:49.562 --> 05:52.099
and the darkest storms
are yet ahead.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.162
Come on down
to Bouncy's Trampoline Park!

05:55.254 --> 05:56.958
Whoa!
What is going on?

05:57.046 --> 06:00.494
After the Yummy Time Pizza ad
drove their profits up 30%,

06:00.582 --> 06:02.953
everyone went all-in
on anti-you.

06:03.041 --> 06:04.121
Not "everyone."

06:04.209 --> 06:05.455
Ha, ha, hi!

06:05.603 --> 06:08.959
I'm Mike Lindell,
the inventor of My Pillow!

06:09.053 --> 06:10.558
That's the famous commercial

06:10.645 --> 06:12.014
starring Mike Lindell.

06:12.102 --> 06:15.466
He's had an untraditional rise
to business success.

06:15.554 --> 06:18.225
Yeah, I used to be
addicted to crack!

06:18.353 --> 06:20.998
But after I went two weeks
with no sleep,

06:21.086 --> 06:23.957
my dealers intervened,
I found Jesus,

06:24.045 --> 06:26.750
built the largest
pillow company in America,

06:26.838 --> 06:29.959
and now I'm best friends
with President Trump!

06:30.047 --> 06:32.400
Is that the guy who keeps
chasing my motorcade?

06:32.488 --> 06:33.654
Oh, yeah.

06:35.246 --> 06:37.850
"Medicare for all"?
Are these kids serious?

06:37.979 --> 06:40.699
Oh, yeah. With these
Democratic candidates,

06:40.787 --> 06:44.144
it's "raise taxes" this and
"no generational wars" that.

06:44.232 --> 06:47.475
The problem is, I'm not polling
as well with progressive voters

06:47.562 --> 06:50.308
as I am with Dale
the racist Amtrak conductor.

06:50.404 --> 06:51.722
- Hiya, Dale!
- Hey, Joe!

06:51.810 --> 06:53.848
Keep on keepin' them prisons
full! Doin' a great job!

06:53.935 --> 06:55.475
Since Hillary's sitting
this election out,

06:55.562 --> 06:57.266
you're our only hope.
Go spread the word

06:57.353 --> 06:59.467
about "trumped-up
trickle-down" economics.

06:59.555 --> 07:01.683
The phrase was perfect.
Clinton just kept coughing

07:01.771 --> 07:03.224
in the middle of it.
Don't worry!

07:03.311 --> 07:05.256
If there's one thing
progressives love,

07:05.344 --> 07:07.490
it's an old white guy
with one black friend

07:07.578 --> 07:08.818
and a lot of opinions.

07:09.451 --> 07:11.519
Screw this.
I'm running away.

07:11.607 --> 07:13.176
If those businesses
don't like me,

07:13.264 --> 07:14.699
they can find
another president

07:14.787 --> 07:17.687
to sign their executive orders
sight unseen.

07:19.478 --> 07:21.139
Need a ride
to Reagan Airport?

07:21.227 --> 07:22.432
Not with you, Mitt.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.101
I'll let you play
with the sunroof.

07:26.211 --> 07:27.832
So you're
running away, huh?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.396
Mr. President,
don't give up.

07:29.484 --> 07:32.230
The only friend you need
in this world is a corporation.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.967
Why are you driving 15 miles
under the speed limit?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.271
Back at Bain Capital,
I didn't make a lot of friends.

07:37.366 --> 07:38.932
I'd roll into town,
and the next day,

07:39.020 --> 07:41.271
the only thing left was
a brothel and a soup kitchen.

07:41.359 --> 07:43.779
How do you not have
the air conditioner on?

07:43.867 --> 07:45.322
It's a hundred degrees
in here!

07:45.410 --> 07:46.787
But my business liked me,

07:46.875 --> 07:48.538
and that was the only friend
I needed.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.799
Now, I'm taking you to
the best place in the world

07:51.887 --> 07:55.404
to make big business
your best friend.

07:55.492 --> 07:58.196
- The White House?
- That's right.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.437
But I was just at
the White House.

08:00.525 --> 08:03.432
Yes. I'm saying you can
use the presidency

08:03.520 --> 08:04.642
to win back businesses.

08:04.729 --> 08:07.016
No. You said you were
taking me somewhere.

08:07.103 --> 08:09.700
- This is where I live.
- I know that. I-I was just...

08:09.788 --> 08:10.933
You made a mistake,
admit it.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.516
- I, uh...
- Despite your useless advice,

08:13.603 --> 08:17.391
I'm going to leverage
the power of this White House

08:17.478 --> 08:20.718
to win back
Corporate America!

08:24.564 --> 08:26.393
How do I
exploit my sacred office

08:26.481 --> 08:28.504
to get businesses
to stop being mean to me?

08:28.592 --> 08:31.183
I'm thinking all-access
to our Saudi death squad.

08:31.271 --> 08:33.976
You could stop staying
how great Nazis are.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.642
Oh, and why don't I start

08:35.729 --> 08:38.177
walking on the ceiling
and breathing underwater?

08:38.265 --> 08:40.222
Practical ideas only, people.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.028
No workplace regulations.

08:42.116 --> 08:43.412
If you don't want
black lung,

08:43.500 --> 08:46.121
you shouldn't have taken a job
at Babies 'R' Us.

08:46.209 --> 08:48.081
How about kids receive
school credit

08:48.169 --> 08:49.480
for warning
business leaders

08:49.568 --> 08:51.349
that their wives
are on their way home?

08:51.437 --> 08:52.777
We already invited
the CEOs

08:52.865 --> 08:55.051
of the 50 largest companies
to a roundtable

08:55.139 --> 08:56.886
so they can tell us
exactly what they want.

08:56.974 --> 08:58.119
Takes out
the guesswork!

08:58.207 --> 08:59.418
Smart! See, Mnuchin?

08:59.506 --> 09:02.519
I'm happy, the Nazis are happy,
everyone's happy.

09:04.686 --> 09:06.728
Joe, you can come in,
uh, but only if you talk

09:06.816 --> 09:08.137
the way you do around
other white people.

09:08.224 --> 09:10.519
Right on, my brotha!
Jazz!

09:11.071 --> 09:13.682
I need to smack these
progressives on the ass

09:13.770 --> 09:14.941
to make them fall in line.

09:15.029 --> 09:17.609
How 'bout I call Liz Warren
"Land O' Lakes Girl"

09:17.697 --> 09:19.527
and say Beto
ran over a cop?

09:19.615 --> 09:20.778
Joe, that won't work.

09:20.866 --> 09:22.988
To unite the party,
you need good policy ideas

09:23.076 --> 09:24.322
like "hope" and "change."

09:24.410 --> 09:26.449
Otherwise you're just
sowing division like Trump.

09:26.537 --> 09:28.557
And where did that get him?
I-Isn't he president?

09:28.645 --> 09:31.683
- Not my president.
- Fine. I'll play nice.

09:31.770 --> 09:34.725
Can I at least say Julián Castro
was actually a triplet,

09:34.812 --> 09:36.433
but ate the third brother
in the crib?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.433
Oooh, that's a good idea
for a show.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.722
I might pitch it to Netflix.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.793
Evil Triplet.
Uh, would you watch that?

09:41.881 --> 09:43.043
Probably not.

09:43.131 --> 09:44.543
- Quadruplets?
- Eh, I don't know.

09:44.687 --> 09:45.806
It takes a lot of courage

09:45.894 --> 09:47.391
to put yourself out there
creatively, Joe,

09:47.478 --> 09:49.436
so just be a little
sensitive to that.

09:51.269 --> 09:53.754
None of those CEOs
are coming, are they?

09:53.842 --> 09:56.005
Ha, ha, hi!
Sorry I'm late.

09:56.093 --> 09:59.293
A Secret Service dog barked
at me and, next thing you know,

09:59.381 --> 10:01.566
your fellas slapped me
on a metal table

10:01.654 --> 10:03.301
and searched me
inside-out!

10:03.389 --> 10:05.135
Whatever they did to you
wasn't enough.

10:05.223 --> 10:07.886
Good news is I brought you
My Pillow.

10:07.981 --> 10:10.431
It's a state-of-the-art
pillow I produce...

10:10.519 --> 10:11.392
Mike.

10:11.479 --> 10:13.345
I produce right here
in Minnesota!

10:13.433 --> 10:16.261
Great. Now we just need
the rest of Corporate America.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.715
Got any friends
you can call?

10:17.803 --> 10:18.841
Double no!

10:18.929 --> 10:21.988
Don't got friends,
don't got a phone!

10:22.605 --> 10:24.224
Ah, God bless all of ya,

10:24.311 --> 10:26.350
but I don't want it
to get ugly out there,

10:26.437 --> 10:29.558
so why don't y'all drop out
and let me be president, huh?

10:29.631 --> 10:31.267
Just because you're
polling well now

10:31.355 --> 10:32.689
doesn't mean
you will forever.

10:32.777 --> 10:35.141
Look at me...
I was a rising star,

10:35.228 --> 10:38.166
then people found out I told
one weird lie a thousand times,

10:38.254 --> 10:39.682
and now no one will
look me in the eye.

10:39.769 --> 10:40.769
Don't forget about me.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.947
After a president
who's a philandering crook,

10:43.035 --> 10:45.074
Americans are more
receptive than ever

10:45.162 --> 10:47.618
to someone who's not that
or anything else.

10:47.729 --> 10:50.668
Gosh, I hate to see the party
torn apart like this.

10:50.756 --> 10:52.478
Kamala, how'd you like
to be rumored

10:52.566 --> 10:55.096
to be my running mate until
I end up choosing Tim Kaine?

10:55.184 --> 10:57.338
Joe, the party
has passed you by.

10:57.426 --> 10:58.722
Beating you
will be easier

10:58.810 --> 11:01.136
than denying a trans inmate
corrective surgery

11:01.224 --> 11:03.474
so they can fight
wildfires instead, ha!

11:03.562 --> 11:06.391
Look, Missy, I invented
keeping non-violent criminals

11:06.478 --> 11:07.642
locked up indefinitely.

11:07.729 --> 11:09.564
Did you, or did you
just steal it

11:09.652 --> 11:12.377
like you did
your 1988 stump speech,

11:12.465 --> 11:14.392
you rusty old
tub of feces?

11:14.480 --> 11:15.316
- Wait
- Whoa!

11:15.404 --> 11:17.932
I'm serious. Lift your
balls off the ground

11:18.020 --> 11:19.668
and shove off
back to Scranton

11:19.756 --> 11:22.074
before I cram you into
the luggage rack of an Amtrak

11:22.162 --> 11:23.621
and send you there!

11:23.709 --> 11:25.371
And not on the Acela, Joe!

11:25.459 --> 11:27.080
The Northeast Regional,
bitch!

11:27.199 --> 11:28.078
- This is preposterous!
- Jesus!

11:28.166 --> 11:29.677
- Get ahold of this!
- What?! Come at me!

11:29.764 --> 11:32.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's all take a step back.

11:32.277 --> 11:33.767
Maybe we can find
some common ground.

11:33.854 --> 11:35.261
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

11:35.349 --> 11:36.955
I can skateboard
better than you, dork!

11:37.043 --> 11:38.641
Joe, we won't back down.

11:38.729 --> 11:41.144
Literally every decision
I've made in my life

11:41.232 --> 11:43.041
has been in service
of this moment,

11:43.129 --> 11:44.707
including getting
my girlfriend.

11:44.795 --> 11:46.298
D-Did I mention
I have a girlfriend?

11:46.386 --> 11:47.176
Yes.

11:47.264 --> 11:48.683
You probably know her
from the movies.

11:48.770 --> 11:49.980
Do you wanna meet her?
I'll get her!

11:50.067 --> 11:51.503
I made her wait
in the parking lot

11:51.591 --> 11:52.386
in case you wanted
to meet her.

11:52.474 --> 11:54.179
I'll get her. Hold on.

11:54.562 --> 11:56.516
He's about to walk in here
with a body pillow.

11:57.745 --> 11:59.196
So many great CEOs

11:59.284 --> 12:00.815
wanted to speak on my behalf,

12:00.903 --> 12:03.190
but I decided to go with
the one who showed up...

12:03.278 --> 12:05.024
My Pillow's Mike Lindell!

12:05.186 --> 12:06.370
Ha, ha, hi!

12:06.458 --> 12:09.037
I'm Mike Lindell,
and I make pillows!

12:09.136 --> 12:11.897
I support this president,
and you should, too!

12:11.985 --> 12:13.909
Great, Mike.
Thank you.

12:13.997 --> 12:15.464
Oh-oh-oh, I got more!

12:15.562 --> 12:16.767
Like Trumpy here,

12:16.854 --> 12:19.725
I have the classic
American success story.

12:19.812 --> 12:22.824
2007, the coroner
declares me dead,

12:22.912 --> 12:26.262
and just before they roll me
into an unmarked hobo grave,

12:26.350 --> 12:28.846
I snap to, head-butt S-O-S

12:28.934 --> 12:30.877
against the roof
of that pine box,

12:30.965 --> 12:34.307
and thank God the grave digger's
headphones weren't workin'

12:34.425 --> 12:37.111
because he ripped me
out of the ground and...

12:37.199 --> 12:38.979
Okay.
Any questions?

12:39.808 --> 12:41.974
Any questions not about crack?

12:44.145 --> 12:46.529
If you're just joining us,
we are on minute 40

12:46.617 --> 12:47.686
without a commercial break.

12:47.773 --> 12:50.624
Let's go now once again
to Vice President Joe Biden.

12:50.712 --> 12:53.734
And may I just say,
I've never met a more gorgeous

12:53.837 --> 12:56.124
Filipino girl than your
production assistant.

12:56.212 --> 12:58.302
Not bad considering what
you're capable of saying.

12:58.390 --> 12:58.975
Big-time.

12:59.062 --> 13:00.516
Mr. Biden
has taken off the gloves

13:00.603 --> 13:02.183
and just released
the first attack ad

13:02.270 --> 13:04.266
of the Democratic primary.
Take a look.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.538
If these Democratic candidates

13:06.626 --> 13:09.205
refuse to endorse Joe Biden
for president,

13:09.360 --> 13:12.315
can we trust their judgement
as president?

13:12.403 --> 13:14.982
The answer is no.
The answer is Joe.

13:15.271 --> 13:18.266
Don't Make An Old Man Beg.

13:18.353 --> 13:20.433
Are you concerned that
since you've now attacked

13:20.520 --> 13:21.457
your fellow Democrats,

13:21.545 --> 13:23.869
they may strike back
with opposition research?

13:23.957 --> 13:25.924
Ah, they wouldn't
look into my past.

13:26.103 --> 13:29.728
The only thing in my past
is a bunch of hazy memories.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.691
Well, our lone pitchman
tried to sell us door-to-door,

13:34.779 --> 13:37.220
and the business world
threw hot coffee in his face.

13:37.308 --> 13:38.350
No offense, Mike.

13:38.437 --> 13:41.413
Not my first brush with
humiliation. I'll tell ya that.

13:41.501 --> 13:43.891
I once offered this dealer
an exchange

13:43.979 --> 13:46.850
where I'd pretend to be
a kind of "human shoe."

13:46.937 --> 13:49.808
Hello, if you want
businesses to chase you,

13:49.910 --> 13:51.484
make 'em jealous
by grinding up

13:51.572 --> 13:53.985
on big, strong
competing businesses!

13:54.073 --> 13:55.178
You think that'll work?

13:55.266 --> 13:57.721
I loved this cute guy,
so to make him jealous,

13:57.809 --> 13:59.597
I started dating Jared.

13:59.685 --> 14:02.056
I forgot about the whole plan
until just now.

14:02.144 --> 14:03.599
It's so gonna work!

14:03.687 --> 14:05.702
Interesting!
Good news, Mike...

14:05.790 --> 14:08.902
I'm announcing an $800-billion
stimulus package

14:08.990 --> 14:10.696
for the comfy pillow
industry.

14:10.854 --> 14:13.382
No thanks!
I'm a self-made man!

14:13.470 --> 14:15.508
I made myself
addicted to crack,

14:15.596 --> 14:17.664
I made myself addicted
to pillows...

14:17.752 --> 14:20.081
More good news...
You have no choice.

14:20.655 --> 14:22.090
Ha, ha, hi!

14:22.186 --> 14:24.433
I'm Mike Lindell, CEO of

14:24.520 --> 14:27.516
My International Holdings
and Defense Solutions,

14:27.603 --> 14:31.141
parent company of countless
newly created subsidiaries

14:31.228 --> 14:34.761
that support our president,
like My Yummy Pizza.

14:34.849 --> 14:37.057
If you're not getting
the pizza you need

14:37.145 --> 14:40.808
from Yummy Time Pizza,
try My Yummy Pizza.

14:40.911 --> 14:44.766
I've tried every pizza
out there, and nothing works.

14:44.854 --> 14:46.408
Our patented cheese

14:46.496 --> 14:49.182
forms to the exact same shape
of your mouth

14:49.270 --> 14:52.103
so you can always have
a restful pizza!

14:52.191 --> 14:53.647
My Yummy Pizza is the most

14:53.735 --> 14:55.713
comfortable pizza
you'll ever eat.

14:55.801 --> 14:59.380
Before My Yummy Pizza,
I had difficulty eating pizza.

14:59.528 --> 15:02.775
Now I have a good night's
pizza every night!

15:02.863 --> 15:06.806
Call now! Our pizza technicians
are standing by!

15:06.902 --> 15:09.773
And don't forget
to support our president.

15:09.861 --> 15:12.259
He's guarding
our conservative values

15:12.347 --> 15:14.093
from cloven-hoofed Democrats

15:14.181 --> 15:16.720
hell-bent on
Christian genocide!

15:16.808 --> 15:19.015
♪ For the best pizza
in the whole wide world ♪

15:19.103 --> 15:20.390
♪ Eat My Yummy Pizza ♪

15:20.478 --> 15:21.892

15:21.979 --> 15:23.470
Thank you, thank you.

15:23.558 --> 15:26.304
My International Holdings
and Defense Solutions

15:26.392 --> 15:30.055
is now the largest multinational
corporation on Earth,

15:30.143 --> 15:31.973
and they are proudly pro-Trump.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.688
Soon, Mike Lindell will
disrupt every industry

15:34.776 --> 15:36.978
with his massive
government funding.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.657
Ha, ha! Wow!
That's a lot of companies!

15:39.745 --> 15:42.390
Good thing the crack
fried the part of my brain

15:42.478 --> 15:43.985
with any self-doubt!

15:44.556 --> 15:45.974
Great idea, Ivanka.

15:46.061 --> 15:48.224
Keep it up, and you'll be
Commerce Secretary.

15:48.311 --> 15:50.631
Actually, do you want to
just be Commerce Secretary?

15:50.719 --> 15:53.048
Boom, bam, I dub thee
Commerce Secretary!

15:53.136 --> 15:56.216
Yay! Jared, Daddy
just said something!

15:56.304 --> 15:58.394
Oh, yay, great.
Hey, you need to see this.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.162
Come on down to Seafood Shack

16:00.250 --> 16:03.288
where we hate Donald Trump,
but love endless shrimp.

16:03.376 --> 16:04.665
Harris Meat Distributors...

16:04.753 --> 16:06.791
Supporting a coup since 2019.

16:06.879 --> 16:08.958
- Whoa. What's going on?
- Don't you get it?

16:09.046 --> 16:10.918
You are now these
companies' competitor,

16:11.006 --> 16:12.870
so now they are
burying you.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.974
Corporations don't get jealous
like that hot guy Ivanka loves.

16:16.092 --> 16:17.808
They just destroy whatever
stands in their way,

16:17.895 --> 16:19.016
and you are in their way.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.974
Donations to your
legal fund? Done.

16:21.061 --> 16:23.266
Donations to your
reelection campaign? Done.

16:23.353 --> 16:25.308
You? Done!

16:26.014 --> 16:27.038
Say "Trump sucks ass"

16:27.126 --> 16:29.542
and receive 20% off of
Sigmund's Prenatal Vitamins.

16:30.647 --> 16:31.334
So, what did you think

16:31.422 --> 16:33.668
of my no-holds-barred
campaign strategy?

16:33.770 --> 16:35.600
Joe, I tried to warn you,

16:35.687 --> 16:37.141
but you just fired
the first shot

16:37.228 --> 16:39.099
in a civil war with
your primary opponents.

16:39.186 --> 16:41.266
Nah, everyone
loves Uncle Joe.

16:41.353 --> 16:44.308
There's not a shoulder in
Washington I haven't massaged.

16:44.395 --> 16:46.141
Just get ready
for the counter punch.

16:46.228 --> 16:48.141
Now, what do you think of this
idea for a Netflix show...

16:48.228 --> 16:49.808
It's a legal drama
in which an attorney

16:49.895 --> 16:51.224
and his colleague
fall in love.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.974
Eh, it sounds
derivative,

16:53.061 --> 16:55.183
and I know a thing or two
about plagiarism.

16:55.270 --> 16:59.099
You didn't let me finish.
Her father is his boss.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.433
Meh.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.391
Did you know 15 networks
rejected Stranger Things?

17:03.478 --> 17:04.558
That's you.

17:04.645 --> 17:05.973
Sure,

17:06.060 --> 17:09.183
most multinational
corporations hate ya,

17:09.270 --> 17:12.183
but I love ya more than
I've ever loved anything

17:12.270 --> 17:13.849
in my entire life!

17:13.936 --> 17:15.849
Ugh.
Well, it's been 45 minutes.

17:15.936 --> 17:18.016
Maybe this thing
has all blown over.

17:18.103 --> 17:19.892
Hello. I'm Stephen Miller.

17:19.979 --> 17:21.642
Tucker Carlson
has the night off.

17:21.729 --> 17:24.599
So... we're just doing this
out in the open now?

17:24.686 --> 17:25.808
The gestating culture war

17:25.895 --> 17:27.797
between pro- and anti-Trump
companies

17:27.885 --> 17:30.265
has burst from its egg
and eaten its mother!

17:30.375 --> 17:33.381
Mobs of hostile citizens,
inspired by warring ads,

17:33.469 --> 17:35.099
are fire-bombing
ice-cream trucks,

17:35.186 --> 17:36.933
overturning bracelet kiosks,

17:37.020 --> 17:40.477
and tearing department-store
mannequins limb from limb!

17:43.225 --> 17:44.515
Welcome to tonight's

17:44.603 --> 17:46.687
Democratic
Presidential Debate.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.770
I'm Jake Tapper,
and most of these questions

17:48.858 --> 17:50.855
will have something
to do with me.

17:51.012 --> 17:52.773
Candidates, please
introduce yourselves.

17:52.861 --> 17:54.445
I'm Senator
Elizabeth Warren!

17:54.533 --> 17:56.172
And Joe Biden
is an out-of-touch,

17:56.311 --> 17:59.398
zero-percent-Cherokee,
pro-Wall-Street Democrat!

17:59.486 --> 18:01.156
Hey, what's good
for Wall Street

18:01.244 --> 18:03.781
is good for Main Street,
or at least Wall Street.

18:03.869 --> 18:06.199
I'm Senator Cory Booker,
and Joe Biden

18:06.287 --> 18:08.451
is a sniveling centrist
who doesn't have a girlfriend!

18:08.650 --> 18:10.020
Has the debate started?

18:10.108 --> 18:11.980
'Cause I wouldn't mind
rebutting some of this.

18:12.068 --> 18:13.881
I'm Senator Kamala Harris

18:13.969 --> 18:15.555
of the great state
of California.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.599
Finally... someone
who follows the rules.

18:17.687 --> 18:18.953
And Joe Biden
hugs too much!

18:19.041 --> 18:21.281
He's probably hugging someone
right now! Look over there!

18:22.117 --> 18:22.875
Drag him!

18:22.984 --> 18:23.812
Look at us.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.223
Our nation is on the brink
of civil war,

18:26.311 --> 18:29.725
yet we on this stage can't
put aside our petty squabbles.

18:29.812 --> 18:31.602
We must do better.

18:33.461 --> 18:35.877
Next time watch your nuts!

18:38.038 --> 18:39.223
So, the corporate world

18:39.311 --> 18:40.767
has gone nuclear against me,

18:40.854 --> 18:43.224
including developing
their own nuclear weapons,

18:43.311 --> 18:45.016
but I still have My Pillow.

18:45.103 --> 18:48.558
Speaking of, how are we liking
My Yummy Pizza Friday, huh?

18:48.645 --> 18:51.350
Mr. President, this is the
best pizza I've ever had,

18:51.437 --> 18:54.266
and I'm telling my husband
the exact same thing.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.271
Bullshit!
The pizza sucks!

18:56.359 --> 18:57.740
The only reason
we're quiet

18:57.828 --> 19:00.266
is it's glued
our tongues to our teeth.

19:00.353 --> 19:02.133
Hey, Mike Lindell
knows pizza.

19:02.221 --> 19:04.734
If he didn't,
why would I think that?

19:09.336 --> 19:10.892
Mike, can you come in here?

19:10.979 --> 19:13.266
Ha, ha! So, the state
of Minnesota

19:13.353 --> 19:15.558
doesn't allow me
to legally own an oven,

19:15.645 --> 19:19.183
but you wouldn't believe how hot
motel blow dryers get!

19:19.270 --> 19:21.558
Pizza's not hair, Mike.
Just get out of here.

19:21.645 --> 19:24.099
But where will I sleep?!
I'm kidding.

19:24.186 --> 19:28.725
With a My Pillow, any park bench
is a California King.

19:28.812 --> 19:31.516
Hell!
It was an embarrassment.

19:31.603 --> 19:34.141
I didn't even get a chance
to don my leather jacket

19:34.228 --> 19:35.642
and wiggle my eyebrows!

19:35.729 --> 19:37.861
Your opponents are just jealous
that you're riding

19:37.949 --> 19:39.931
an un-inspected
roller coaster to victory.

19:40.043 --> 19:42.664
Yeah, yeah! And I need
to tear off my lap bar

19:42.752 --> 19:44.072
and run as
an independent!

19:44.176 --> 19:46.970
Independent?! Don't you dare,
you monkey's ass.

19:47.058 --> 19:49.263
You're gonna lose this election
for Howard Schultz!

19:49.351 --> 19:50.570
That's a low blow!

19:50.658 --> 19:52.788
You know I'd never
spoil it for Howard!

19:52.886 --> 19:54.674
We all want Howard!

19:55.202 --> 19:56.350
Dad would kill us

19:56.437 --> 19:58.808
if he found out we bought
from the competition.

19:58.895 --> 19:59.933
This is so bad!

20:00.020 --> 20:01.945
I feel like
a trucker from hell.

20:02.033 --> 20:03.835
- Daddy's home!
- Shit!

20:03.937 --> 20:05.266
Eric, eat the razors

20:05.353 --> 20:08.016
and sit your huge ass
on the pizza! NOW!

20:08.663 --> 20:11.202
Is there
something I should know?

20:11.478 --> 20:13.141
Uhhhh, y-yeah.

20:13.228 --> 20:16.350
Uh, Mike Lindell's gross pizza
tastes r-really good!

20:16.437 --> 20:18.099
No, it doesn't.
It tastes like the inside

20:18.186 --> 20:20.183
of Mike Pompeo's
golf gloves.

20:20.270 --> 20:21.642
What are you hiding?

20:21.729 --> 20:23.391
We bought some Nike shoes

20:23.478 --> 20:26.016
and Ben & Jerry's
ice cream!

20:26.103 --> 20:28.224
Okay.
As long as that's I...

20:28.311 --> 20:30.395
Wha... What the heck
is under Eric?

20:32.226 --> 20:34.057
The pizza that hates me?!

20:34.145 --> 20:35.536
I expect this from Eric

20:35.624 --> 20:37.616
because he doesn't understand
right and wrong,

20:37.704 --> 20:39.784
but not the rest of you,
except for Don.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.451
Well, and maybe Ivanka,
I guess.

20:41.539 --> 20:43.661
I swear we only
went behind your back

20:43.749 --> 20:46.119
because your products
suck ass. Honest!

20:46.232 --> 20:49.641
If it makes you feel better,
I-I just swallowed some razors.

20:49.729 --> 20:51.268
Sick!
Pass me some blades!

20:51.360 --> 20:54.607
Eric, for any other act of
treason, that would be enough,

20:54.835 --> 20:56.834
but not this.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:05.103 --> 21:07.408
Next pizza party animal.

21:07.496 --> 21:11.390
Hello. I'm a liberal loser
who'd like a pepperoni pizza

21:11.478 --> 21:13.869
that doesn't taste like
old clams and Clearasil.

21:13.957 --> 21:16.575
Great. Do you want the pepperoni
to spell "Trump sucks"

21:16.663 --> 21:17.815
or, for an extra buck,

21:17.903 --> 21:20.223
we'll draw Trump as a deranged
clown in green peppers?

21:20.311 --> 21:22.986
Not a big veggie guy.
I'll take "Trump sucks."

21:23.074 --> 21:25.307
Oh, and, uh,
where's your restroom?

21:28.305 --> 21:31.140
Oh, God!
What is wrong with me?!

21:31.228 --> 21:33.855
Why am I eating
what hates me?!

21:33.943 --> 21:36.686
Whose side am I on?!

21:38.207 --> 21:42.373
Why must this culture war
tear at the very fabric of...

21:43.118 --> 21:45.410
You get ten more minutes,
Mr. President,

21:45.498 --> 21:47.350
then I'm calling
the cops.

21:47.437 --> 21:50.058
And that's why I've left
the Democratic Party

21:50.145 --> 21:51.558
to form the Biden Party

21:51.646 --> 21:54.352
which stands for
pragmatism, civility,

21:54.548 --> 21:56.919
and a mature approach
to governance.

21:57.061 --> 21:58.683
Hey! It's the quiet car!

21:58.770 --> 22:00.266
Exactly.
So you should shut up.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.099
No, you shut up!
I'm trying to do some work!

22:02.186 --> 22:03.810
What, some dumb
marketing crap?

22:03.898 --> 22:05.912
- Shh! Shh!
- Shh! No, you shush!

22:06.061 --> 22:07.386
La-la-la-la!

22:07.474 --> 22:09.209
Noise-noise-noise-noise!!

22:09.388 --> 22:11.308
Look... at... you.

22:11.395 --> 22:14.099
It's like I'm looking
at myself six years ago,

22:14.186 --> 22:15.933
except you're not trying
to sell your daughter's

22:16.020 --> 22:17.982
Lite-Brite
for a bag of flake.

22:18.070 --> 22:21.057
I almost wish
I could go back

22:21.145 --> 22:23.349
and not say that thing
about Nazis.

22:23.438 --> 22:25.851
Look, I'm just your
average crack addict

22:25.939 --> 22:27.810
turned pillow mogul
next door,

22:27.898 --> 22:30.103
but here's my glassy-eyed
point of view.

22:30.191 --> 22:33.188
You've made politics
so intense that not even

22:33.276 --> 22:35.813
Seafood Shack can stay
on the sidelines,

22:35.936 --> 22:37.162
and it's kind of fun.

22:37.250 --> 22:40.116
I don't need drugs because I can
just walk into a restaurant

22:40.204 --> 22:42.818
wearing a MAGA hat,
and the ensuing riot

22:42.906 --> 22:46.613
provides everything I crave...
A bullet-train heart rate

22:46.701 --> 22:49.873
and a chorus of voices
screaming that I'm the devil!

22:49.961 --> 22:52.124
Things are pretty intense.
Hmm.

22:52.235 --> 22:54.140
I wonder if the country
is ready

22:54.228 --> 22:56.350
for that civil war
we all know is coming.

22:56.437 --> 22:58.892
Hey, after a long day
of battle,

22:58.979 --> 23:02.391
the child soldiers
can sleep on My Pillow!

23:03.490 --> 23:05.266
Uh, Joe?

23:05.540 --> 23:06.540
Joe!

23:06.849 --> 23:08.340
How long have you been here?

23:08.437 --> 23:10.642
Since I got
kicked off the train.

23:10.729 --> 23:12.558
So, how's the Biden Party
polling?

23:12.645 --> 23:15.943
100% disapproval
among marketing dorks!

23:16.031 --> 23:19.111
Joe, don't get frustrated.
It's not 2008.

23:19.199 --> 23:20.862
You're not going to
unify this party.

23:20.957 --> 23:23.107
Just go out there
and speak from the heart,

23:23.195 --> 23:25.233
like only Joe Biden can.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.432
Thanks, Barack.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.545
You know, I got
a killer idea for a show.

23:28.633 --> 23:30.214
It's a historical drama...

23:30.302 --> 23:32.558
No! That's a bad idea
for a show. Sucks!

23:32.646 --> 23:34.162
See how it feels?

23:34.623 --> 23:37.459
And that's how I
learned that during a rainstorm,

23:37.615 --> 23:40.263
you can always squat
under someone's grill.

23:40.351 --> 23:43.613
Daddy! Pro-Trump patriots
and anti-Trump Antifa

23:43.701 --> 23:45.850
are clashing outside
of Yummy Time Pizza.

23:45.937 --> 23:48.266
They say it might erupt
into a real civil war!

23:48.353 --> 23:50.935
Oh, my God!
Did I not just call that?

23:51.023 --> 23:53.537
Mike, tell Ivanka
I just called that!

23:57.763 --> 24:00.099
If we lose this battle,
the tide will turn

24:00.186 --> 24:02.850
in Yummy Time Pizza's favor,
and soon all the nation

24:02.937 --> 24:05.388
will be tragically united
in opposition to me.

24:05.476 --> 24:07.598
All right, boys,
are you ready?

24:07.686 --> 24:09.342
I feel a little off.

24:09.430 --> 24:11.193
I think it might be
the razor blades.

24:11.281 --> 24:14.111
Though it could
also be Mike Lindell's pizza.

24:14.272 --> 24:16.435
Ha, ha!
I wouldn't rule it out.

24:16.523 --> 24:20.227
I saw more than a few mites
bunking up in those hair dryers.

24:20.315 --> 24:24.498
Now say the word,
and I'll smother everyone here!

24:25.154 --> 24:27.600
Ivanka, where did you
get a horse?

24:27.687 --> 24:29.701
Every Secretary of Commerce
gets one.

24:29.789 --> 24:31.570
I'm not gonna tell you
how to do your job.

24:31.658 --> 24:33.560
On the count of "three,"
this war begins,

24:33.648 --> 24:36.057
and no matter
who lives and who dies,

24:36.145 --> 24:39.638
at some point, I'm probably
going to have some pizza.

24:39.849 --> 24:43.193
One... two... three!

24:48.090 --> 24:49.349
C'mere, you!

24:49.480 --> 24:53.099
My fellow Americans,
I, and no one else,

24:53.187 --> 24:55.808
said four score
and seven years ago

24:55.895 --> 24:59.357
that the only thing
we have to fear is fear itself.

24:59.445 --> 25:02.191
So ask not what your country
can do for you,

25:02.279 --> 25:06.490
ask Mr. Gorbachev
to tear down this wall!

25:06.619 --> 25:09.432
I guess what those
immortal words of mine meant

25:09.520 --> 25:12.170
were, "Knock it off!
Stop your bellyaching!

25:12.258 --> 25:16.049
We're lucky to be alive!
Now go back to work!"

25:17.333 --> 25:20.255
Joe. Once again,
I gotta bail you out.

25:20.343 --> 25:22.099
Despite what Joe says,

25:22.187 --> 25:24.433
our political differences
are legitimate,

25:24.521 --> 25:25.850
but let me be clear.

25:25.938 --> 25:28.771
There's not a liberal America
and a conservative America;

25:28.859 --> 25:31.396
there's the United States
of America, right?

25:31.603 --> 25:33.568
- Right. Oh, yeah.
- Right, right, right.

25:33.656 --> 25:38.013
Okay, good. So go buy stuff.
Stuff is just stuff.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.639
You know, uh, companies only
get political to make a buck.

25:40.727 --> 25:41.904
- We good here?
- Yeah!

25:41.992 --> 25:43.739
Thank you, Mr. Obama!

25:43.827 --> 25:45.740
Okay, what do you guys think
of a show

25:45.828 --> 25:47.474
that takes place
at a record store?

25:47.562 --> 25:48.959
- Uh...
- Meh...

25:49.047 --> 25:52.002
What if the store was run
by a father and daughter

25:52.090 --> 25:53.740
with different tastes
in music?

25:53.828 --> 25:54.866
- Eh.
- Okay.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.140
Uh, now... now, hold on.

25:56.227 --> 25:59.209
He likes modern music,
she likes the old stuff.

25:59.297 --> 26:02.168
Ha, ha! Even I saw
that one comin'!

26:02.256 --> 26:04.432
Eh, forget it.
I still think it's solid.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.576
Joe, let's go drone
that marketing dork.

26:06.664 --> 26:08.096
Hell yeah!

26:08.184 --> 26:10.515
Well,
I got what I came here for.

26:11.342 --> 26:12.545
Hey, Common again,

26:12.633 --> 26:15.129
for the United States
Chamber of Commerce.

26:15.270 --> 26:18.475
After the light skirmishes of
the near civil war this week,

26:18.562 --> 26:19.974
Corporate America
has discovered

26:20.061 --> 26:23.467
that people don't wanna shop
in stores that are on fire.

26:23.555 --> 26:26.140
So we're just gonna focus on
selling stuff for profit again.

26:26.296 --> 26:29.334
Ahhh, everything is back
to normal with corporations

26:29.459 --> 26:31.600
controlling American life
in the shadows.

26:31.687 --> 26:34.516
Mike, you're officially
my last business friend,

26:34.603 --> 26:36.146
and that's okay by me.

26:36.234 --> 26:39.182
Thanks, Donald!
Well, I better hit the road.

26:39.270 --> 26:40.475
See ya around, Mike.

26:40.562 --> 26:43.381
See you around, Mr. President
of the United States!

26:43.469 --> 26:46.092
I'll just, uh...
My Pillow. Oh...

26:50.631 --> 26:52.736
Ugh! He lives here now,
doesn't he?

26:52.824 --> 26:54.157
My Pillow!
