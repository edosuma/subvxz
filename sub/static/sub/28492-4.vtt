WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:04.420
Oh, wow. My goodness.

00:04.421 --> 00:05.659
- Hon?
- Hmm?

00:05.660 --> 00:07.799
You notice a difference in my physique?

00:07.800 --> 00:09.179
I think because I've been outside

00:09.180 --> 00:10.519
pushing things and pulling,

00:10.520 --> 00:12.579
it seems to be having a real effect.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.990
- Really?
- I mean, I wouldn't go so far as

00:14.000 --> 00:17.010
to use the word "jacked," but
maybe "jacked adjacent"?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.159
Yeah, sure. I think...

00:18.160 --> 00:19.970
Yeah, I would call you
"jacked adjacent."

00:19.979 --> 00:22.059
Oh. Thanks for noticing that.

00:23.370 --> 00:24.739
Um, sweetie,

00:24.740 --> 00:25.960
is it okay if we put on

00:25.970 --> 00:27.359
my "Sounds of the Upper West Side"?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.200
'Cause my mom just sent
me a new recording.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.489
Well, it does make it
a little harder for me

00:31.490 --> 00:33.540
- to fall asleep.
- I know, but it's just so relaxing for me.

00:33.550 --> 00:36.459
I said cream cheese on the side, buddy!

00:36.460 --> 00:38.279
And cover your mouth when you cough,

00:38.280 --> 00:40.289
I could be pregnant!

00:40.290 --> 00:42.559
I just feel my stress melting away.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.189
Oh, so soothing.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.859
Maybe we could alternate between this

00:46.860 --> 00:48.590
and the sounds of war.

00:50.870 --> 00:52.439
Oh, my gosh!

00:52.440 --> 00:54.540
Honey, what's happening? What was that?

00:54.550 --> 00:55.759
Sounds like the chickens!
It's our babies!

00:55.760 --> 00:57.140
- You got to go do something!
- Yeah, I'm on it.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.809
- Oh, my God, our babies!
- All right, um, ooh, uh...

00:58.810 --> 01:00.219
I shouldn't go unarmed, right?

01:00.220 --> 01:01.349
You're buff as hell. You got this.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.389
No, no, I need like a bat or

01:02.390 --> 01:03.399
- some nunchucks or something.
- Honey!

01:03.400 --> 01:04.690
Take my weighted blanket.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.319
- A blanket?
- Is that okay? Is it too heavy?

01:06.320 --> 01:08.039
- Hon, we just went over how cut I am.
- I-I... I'm nervous!

01:08.040 --> 01:09.520
Okay.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.719
Is someone in here?!

01:11.720 --> 01:13.100
I have a weapon!

01:16.890 --> 01:18.059
Ahhh!

01:18.060 --> 01:19.454
Oh, Rudy!

01:19.455 --> 01:20.580
Is that your cape?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.199
No. It's not a cape.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.834
It's a... weighted blanket, for anxiety.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.753
I didn't know you wore
a cape for anxiety.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.671
Rudy, w-what are you doing in here?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.339
- What's with the feathers?
- Oh.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.499
Predator got in the coop.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.509
Oh, no.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.209
- I don't want to be too graphic...
- Thank you.

01:34.210 --> 01:35.804
... but you got a chicken with
her head ripped clean off.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.679
Guts everywhere, gizzard shredded,

01:37.680 --> 01:39.269
body turned completely inside out.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.350
Her eyes were open. She
saw the whole thing.

01:41.352 --> 01:42.644
Hard to believe so much blood

01:42.645 --> 01:43.978
comes from such a small creature.

01:43.979 --> 01:45.349
You can try to mop it
up, but you'll probably

01:45.350 --> 01:46.898
- just spread it around.
- Thank you, Rudy.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.129
Hey, Deb!

01:52.130 --> 01:53.899
- Mail call!
- Yeah.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.890
Yeah, looks like just
a bunch of bills...

01:55.900 --> 01:57.780
- ... and there's a birth announcement.
- Oh. Oh!

01:57.785 --> 01:59.989
Thank you so much for always
going through our mail.

01:59.990 --> 02:01.340
Would it be more fun to just open it?

02:01.350 --> 02:02.497
Oh, I would love that.

02:02.498 --> 02:04.109
- I was kidding.
- Oh, okay. You know what?

02:04.110 --> 02:06.739
I get... I keep getting mail
addressed to Levine-Young...

02:06.740 --> 02:08.127
- Oh.
- ... instead of just Young.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.019
And if that's an error,
I can yell at somebody

02:10.020 --> 02:11.400
down at the main branch
to get that fixed.

02:11.410 --> 02:12.500
Oh, no, thank you so much.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.633
It's not an error.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.926
My last name is Levine,

02:14.927 --> 02:16.549
and Mike's last name is Young,

02:16.550 --> 02:18.346
and so when we got
married, we hyphenated it.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.890
Oh, 'cause Mike said
your name was Young.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.642
Huh. He did?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.029
- Mm-hmm.
- No. I took on his last name...

02:25.030 --> 02:26.999
- Mm-hmm.
- ... and he took on my last name. Um...

02:27.000 --> 02:29.399
Oh, wait, you said that
Mike took your last name?

02:29.400 --> 02:31.317
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.819
He took...

02:32.820 --> 02:34.999
- Oh.
- He t...

02:35.000 --> 02:36.819
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

02:36.820 --> 02:37.889
I'm so sorry.

02:37.890 --> 02:40.279
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, I just needed a laugh today.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.639
Kent's home. He's sick.
He's got the flu,

02:42.640 --> 02:45.019
- and there's diarrhea everywhere.
- Oh.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.333
And he misses the toilet,
and I'm just like, "Ugh."

02:47.334 --> 02:49.819
Anyway, tell Mike that
I said that he's doing

02:49.820 --> 02:52.088
a great job with this farm.
It's really coming along.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.489
Well, you can tell me that, too,

02:53.490 --> 02:56.467
'cause it's also my farm
and I work on it equally.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.511
Yeah, bye, Mrs. Young!

03:02.307 --> 03:03.808
Hey, guys!

03:03.809 --> 03:06.436
The egg mobile's really looking secure.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.521
Ready to roll up my
sleeves. How can I help?

03:08.522 --> 03:09.856
Why don't you make us
some good lemonade.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.358
Oh, you don't want her to do that.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.509
- Thank you, Mike.
- Yeah, when she makes it,

03:14.510 --> 03:16.349
it's, uh, got, like, a texture.

03:16.350 --> 03:18.906
You know, it's like a soup.
Like a thick bisque.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.779
- It's like a lemonade.
- Y'all had an intruder?

03:20.780 --> 03:22.300
- What? Oh, hey!
- Hey.

03:22.310 --> 03:24.349
Yes, I called 911, but
that was last night.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.979
- You're just coming now?
- Believe it or not,

03:25.980 --> 03:28.340
there isn't a code for a dead chicken.

03:28.350 --> 03:30.759
You can't call the sheriff
when a chicken dies,

03:30.760 --> 03:32.559
just like you can't
call the gynecologist

03:32.560 --> 03:33.899
when the Internet goes dead.

03:33.900 --> 03:34.909
Hmm.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.540
Constance?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.135
Rudy?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.199
Gonna be warm tonight.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.513
I suppose it is.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.682
So warm I might sweat
through the sheets.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.144
Well, I hope you have a... spare set.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.938
I do not.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.690
Well, the fireflies are
gonna be out tonight.

03:53.692 --> 03:57.696
I'm gonna be watching
if you want to come by.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.929
No.

04:02.930 --> 04:05.161
Copy that loud and clear.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.199
- Uh, exc... A-Are you sure?
- N-N-No, hold on, hold on.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.769
That would be a really nice
thing, to go see the fireflies,

04:09.770 --> 04:10.969
- 'cause they're so beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

04:10.970 --> 04:12.099
They're the confetti of the angels.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.921
But I stand by my original response.

04:15.940 --> 04:17.569
- Um...
- Okay, well,

04:17.570 --> 04:19.809
- look, whoever killed Deirdre...
- Yes.

04:19.810 --> 04:21.499
- ... is still on the loose, alright?
- Yep.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.340
And I'm gonna be honest, I want revenge.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.580
- Yeah.
- I want vengeance!

04:25.620 --> 04:29.019
What's up with all
this hyper-macho thing

04:29.020 --> 04:30.779
that you've been doing
since we've been here?

04:30.780 --> 04:33.320
Mm. I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:37.330 --> 04:38.829
Please let me have this.

04:38.830 --> 04:41.363
I just feel like we're
falling into these patterns,

04:41.364 --> 04:42.460
and I don't like it.

04:42.470 --> 04:44.129
In New York, we had
an equal partnership.

04:44.130 --> 04:46.049
We were both independent,
capable people,

04:46.050 --> 04:48.119
and now you just expect me
to break out the lemons

04:48.120 --> 04:50.769
and the corn starch and make
lemonade for you and Rudy?

04:50.770 --> 04:52.279
So that's what's going on.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.639
Y-You don't need corn
starch in lemonade.

04:54.640 --> 04:55.759
- Oh.
- That's, I think, why it's chewy.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.349
And then Deb, a federal employee,

04:57.350 --> 04:59.380
got the go-ahead to call you Mike Young.

04:59.390 --> 05:01.740
- Um, that was just a time-saver.
- Yeah, but it...

05:01.750 --> 05:04.346
And, look, I-I don't want
you to just make lemonade.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.579
Thank you.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.806
I would like it if you could
bake some brownies as well.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.560
- Sorry, what?
- To take over to the Bowmans'

05:09.570 --> 05:11.311
so we have access to their
security cam footage.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.579
We gotta figure out what kind
of predator we're hunting,

05:13.580 --> 05:16.107
and Rudy says they have
security trail cams everywhere.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.739
So you want me to...

05:17.740 --> 05:18.760
make brownies?

05:18.770 --> 05:20.444
I'm sorry that this is how it is.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.519
But you're supposed to

05:21.520 --> 05:22.530
bring the brownies over.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.739
- There's just different expectations here.
- Okay, okay,

05:24.740 --> 05:27.000
but their expectations aren't
necessarily our expectations.

05:27.010 --> 05:28.479
- We're aligned in that, right?
- Agreed.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.285
- Great.
- A-And not to get all

05:30.286 --> 05:32.100
"look at the actual facts
of the situation,"

05:32.110 --> 05:34.660
but last night, when you
heard a scary noise,

05:34.670 --> 05:36.060
you wanted me to go check it out.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.319
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way,

05:37.320 --> 05:38.338
- but...
- Okay.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.980
... maybe here...

05:39.990 --> 05:43.260
you feel like you want me to
protect you a little more.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.055
You... You t... You took
that the wrong way.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.558
Yeah, I took it the wrong way.

05:50.630 --> 05:52.018
I hope you were not wearing an apron

05:52.019 --> 05:54.269
when you baked these brownies.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.000
And please tell me you
were wearing oven mitts

05:56.010 --> 05:57.400
when you took them out of the oven.

05:57.420 --> 05:59.769
Because otherwise, you
would burn yourself.

05:59.770 --> 06:01.060
Yeah.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.659
Okay, well, now that we all agree

06:02.660 --> 06:04.319
I'm a man who made brownies,

06:04.320 --> 06:06.113
I'd love to look at
that trail cam footage.

06:06.114 --> 06:08.460
Oh, yeah. Jacob, go check the footage.

06:08.470 --> 06:09.659
What time did you say the assault was?

06:09.660 --> 06:10.699
Around 10:30.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.560
I will be right back.

06:12.860 --> 06:14.100
Well... Well, not right back,

06:14.110 --> 06:16.329
because I do have to look
at the... the footage first,

06:16.330 --> 06:17.559
and then I'll come back and tell you...

06:17.560 --> 06:19.045
- We got it, son.
- Okay.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.239
Mike, obviously I've
lost all respect for you

06:21.240 --> 06:23.579
knowing that you baked these, but...

06:23.580 --> 06:26.169
this is the most delicious
brownie I have ever tasted.

06:26.170 --> 06:27.929
What is going on in my mouth right now?

06:27.930 --> 06:29.609
- My secret's a little sea salt.
- Mmm.

06:29.610 --> 06:32.209
Gives you that sweet, salty
back and forth, a little...

06:32.210 --> 06:33.919
Mm, I'm gonna pass on
that recipe advice to Kay

06:33.920 --> 06:37.280
when she gets back to town. She's
visiting her sister, Stacy...

06:37.780 --> 06:40.979
... who's a very, very beautiful woman.

06:40.980 --> 06:42.650
Hmm.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.949
Jacob!

06:44.950 --> 06:46.698
Did you find out what
got into Mike's coop?

06:46.699 --> 06:48.100
Yup.

06:48.110 --> 06:49.700
It was me.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.537
I killed your chicken, Mike.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.029
Hey. Rudy.

06:57.030 --> 06:59.669
Rio? I wasn't expecting
you. You're not Mike.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.869
Damn right I'm not Mike.
Mike's over at the Bowmans'.

07:01.870 --> 07:04.215
I'm here to murder an
animal. Let's do this.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.219
Why do you have so many keys?

07:05.220 --> 07:06.400
Were you a janitor in New York?

07:06.410 --> 07:08.719
No, this is to defend myself.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.304
From doorknobs?

07:10.305 --> 07:11.472
Actually, I'm glad you came.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.579
I'd like to ask what you thought

07:12.580 --> 07:14.479
about what happened
today with Constance.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.040
She came on a little strong, didn't she?

07:16.050 --> 07:18.539
I'm sorry, but would you be
talking about relationship drama

07:18.540 --> 07:20.889
if you were out here getting
ready for killing with a man?

07:20.890 --> 07:22.900
Maybe. If he was smaller than me.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.653
Can we talk about Constance now?

07:25.654 --> 07:28.979
No. We can only talk about
hunting-related items.

07:28.980 --> 07:29.991
We should split up.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.499
We'll cover more ground.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.239
- It's gonna be dark soon.
- Say what?

07:33.240 --> 07:34.829
You go one way, and I go the other.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.160
So you'll go out on your own,

07:37.170 --> 07:38.829
and I'll go out on my own.

07:38.830 --> 07:40.699
- Yeah, I said that twice now.
- Okay, so we'll be separate.

07:40.700 --> 07:41.789
Alright, great.

07:41.790 --> 07:43.239
This is good. I like this...

07:43.240 --> 07:44.320
- a very, very good plan.
- You hear anything,

07:44.330 --> 07:46.340
call me on the walkie. My
code name is "Potato."

07:46.341 --> 07:47.883
My code name is "Warrior."

07:47.884 --> 07:49.051
No. You're "Potato Three."

07:49.052 --> 07:50.302
What happened to "Potato Two"?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.310
You don't want to know.

07:52.020 --> 07:54.120
Over.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.789
So that's when I decided

07:56.790 --> 07:58.394
that all the chickens had to die.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.893
- No.
- Two chickens had to die.

07:59.894 --> 08:02.139
- It was only one.
- But I killed it lots of times.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.169
No. No, no, no, no. Something's up.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.179
Let's go look at the tape.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.020
No, no, no, Dad! Please
don't look at the tape!

08:13.420 --> 08:17.149
Well... this is embarrassing.

08:17.150 --> 08:19.080
Jacob killed your chicken.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.962
Cold one?

08:25.963 --> 08:27.640
We're... not gonna talk about

08:27.650 --> 08:28.841
what was on the footage?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.789
What's there to say?

08:30.790 --> 08:32.200
Jacob's a teenaged chicken-killer.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.099
Look, we all saw what was on the tapes,

08:34.100 --> 08:35.890
and, Beau, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

08:35.892 --> 08:37.000
Of course not.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.899
If I was ashamed of
something, I'd act like it.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.270
- Yeah.
- No, sir.

08:46.310 --> 08:48.079
Okay, so, on the off chance

08:48.080 --> 08:49.959
that Jacob didn't kill my chicken,

08:49.960 --> 08:51.799
I think I need to search
for the predator.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.299
So I'll leave you two to talk.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.783
I imagine you have a
whole lot to get into...

08:55.784 --> 08:58.060
emotions and vulnerability, openness...

08:58.070 --> 08:59.769
Hold it!

08:59.770 --> 09:01.791
Why don't we help. We got all the gear.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.250
You'd be a fool not to
take advantage of us.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.962
Oh, yeah, Mike, take advantage
of us all night long.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.340
How could I say no to that?

09:09.341 --> 09:11.300
See this mother right here?

09:11.301 --> 09:12.679
Oh, wow. Oh.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.553
Got my shirt caught in a feed grinder.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.889
Nearly tore through my bicep.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.079
So badass.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.729
Still made it to my wedding on time.

09:18.730 --> 09:20.184
Had to army crawl ten miles.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.977
I didn't even go to the hospital.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.829
Only help I had was from
Dr. Kentucky Bourbon.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.149
You know what I'm saying?

09:26.150 --> 09:27.880
- Mm.
- So tough.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.480
Wow! We taking all those?

09:30.487 --> 09:31.639
Scared of the manpower?

09:31.640 --> 09:32.738
No problemo.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.939
We'll go with a blade instead.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.200
Jacob, why don't you grab a ma-che-te.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.620
Ding!

09:39.621 --> 09:42.039
Oh, wow. Hey. Okay.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.958
Jacob, be careful, yeah?
It's probably sharp.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.251
Yeah. Yes.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.619
It is very sharp.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.964
But it's safe if you
know what you're doing.

09:51.210 --> 09:52.579
Ohh...

09:52.580 --> 09:53.589
Oh!

09:53.590 --> 09:54.969
I'm... fine.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.599
Your thumb is on the floor.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.080
That's not where it's supposed to be.

10:00.550 --> 10:02.226
- It's not on your hand right now.
- Use this.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.227
Ooh.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.169
We need to go to the hospital.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.309
- My son lost his thumb.
- Yeah.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.567
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, I'll drive. I'll drive.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.360
You go out and be with your dad.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.709
- Aah, gross!
- I just touched it.

10:12.710 --> 10:13.880
- Okay. Ugh.
- Ahh!

10:15.000 --> 10:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:22.622 --> 10:25.360
Okay...

10:26.260 --> 10:28.129
Hey, Potato.

10:28.130 --> 10:29.369
How's it going over there?

10:29.370 --> 10:30.919
Did you see the critter, Potato Three?

10:30.920 --> 10:32.119
No, not exactly.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.039
- Uh, but...
- Then we should stay off the walkies

10:34.040 --> 10:35.880
unless there's an emergency. Over.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.309
It is an emergency in a way,

10:39.310 --> 10:42.141
'cause we should probably...
talk about Constance.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.518
Boy, is that a tough nut to crack.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.229
Why do you think you said no to
going to see those fireflies?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.379
Because she's not the one who's
supposed to ask me out on a date.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.479
That's the man's job.
What's left for me to do?

10:51.480 --> 10:52.519
Bat my eyelashes

10:52.520 --> 10:54.402
- and blow sweet kissies?
- Sure, sure, sure.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.499
You're used to the man doing the asking,

10:56.500 --> 10:58.489
but, you know, there's
lots of ways to do things.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.919
Like when you bring me
dirty laundry to do,

11:00.920 --> 11:02.679
sometimes Mike does it.
There's a very good chance

11:02.680 --> 11:04.819
that Mike washed the underwear
that you're wearing right now.

11:04.820 --> 11:06.220
A-And it's important to remember

11:06.230 --> 11:07.979
that the reason you like Constance

11:07.980 --> 11:09.040
is because she's strong

11:09.044 --> 11:11.963
and because she does
things for herself, right?

11:13.380 --> 11:14.840
Rudy?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.069
Rudy, you with me?

11:19.580 --> 11:22.010
- I need to go see Constance.
- Wait, right now?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.399
No, Rudy, listen to me, I think
that this Constance thing

11:24.400 --> 11:27.309
could be really the symptom of a
much larger problem, and I...

11:27.310 --> 11:28.799
That's okay. I'm very happy
with everything else

11:28.800 --> 11:29.839
that's wrong with me.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.857
Goodbye, Potato Three.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.479
Potato, over and out.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.829
No, it's not over till
we both "over." Over?

11:34.830 --> 11:36.129
Damn it!

11:40.450 --> 11:42.099
Not cool!

11:47.624 --> 11:48.749
Aah!

11:48.750 --> 11:50.160
Aah! Weasel!

11:50.170 --> 11:53.530
Oh, God, I should've just
made the stupid brownies!

11:55.060 --> 11:56.940
Alright, well, it's gonna
take about an hour

11:56.950 --> 11:58.999
to get to the hospital,
but if all goes well,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.929
old Jacob's gonna be hitchhiking
with strangers in no time..

12:01.930 --> 12:04.289
Do you need me to drive to the hospital?

12:04.290 --> 12:06.725
No, I-I got... I got it.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.311
Um... so, it's no big deal,

12:09.312 --> 12:12.399
just a little FYI, the weasel is, um...

12:12.400 --> 12:14.199
... is inside our house,

12:14.200 --> 12:17.349
and I just need you to come home
and kind of take care of it.

12:17.350 --> 12:18.570
I would love nothing more

12:18.571 --> 12:20.531
- than to take care of that weasel, but...
- Okay, great!

12:20.532 --> 12:22.190
So just, you know, come on home

12:22.200 --> 12:24.110
and... and take care of it now.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.661
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.496
What do you want to hear? I'm scared.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.639
I'm a fragile, little woman

12:28.640 --> 12:30.110
with fragile, little birdy bones, okay?

12:30.120 --> 12:32.660
I'm mentally and physically
incapable of survival.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.790
Does that work? Is that enough?
Can you come home now?

12:34.796 --> 12:36.139
I can't come home right now.

12:36.140 --> 12:38.169
I'm trying like hell
to keep a thumb fresh!

12:38.170 --> 12:39.579
Hey, Dad, what do you think

12:39.580 --> 12:41.379
of the Huskers' new wide receiver, huh?

12:41.380 --> 12:42.399
He's the top recruit.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.637
- Yep.
- A good get.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.718
You remember, you thought
Michigan was gonna get him?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.259
They're talking about
football. They're fine!

12:49.260 --> 12:50.519
You got to come home!

12:50.520 --> 12:52.813
It's way more messed
up than that, sweetie.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.739
I will come protect you from
the weasel when I get back.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.079
Oh, but that could be all night, babe.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.109
- Ugh!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.279
- I-I just...
- Shut this, shut this, shut this.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.979
You have one job, Beau!

13:00.980 --> 13:02.379
To hold the thumb!

13:02.380 --> 13:04.242
What's happening, Mike? Honey?

13:04.243 --> 13:05.419
I love you, but I gotta go.

13:05.420 --> 13:06.429
Mike!

13:09.560 --> 13:10.780
Mm.

13:13.230 --> 13:14.543
Who died?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.739
Mom... there's a weasel in my house.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.420
Oh, my God! Did it touch you?

13:18.423 --> 13:19.590
Remember your cousin Neary?

13:19.591 --> 13:21.300
She got rabies from a weasel.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.802
Her brain is mush now. Complete mush.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.013
She still likes animals,
though, which is nice.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.306
How come I've never
heard of this person?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.439
What, am I just gonna bring up

13:28.440 --> 13:30.160
a mushy-brained relative on a whim?

13:30.170 --> 13:31.393
I don... Mom, listen.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.439
Mike's not here,

13:32.440 --> 13:34.890
and he's not gonna be here
for another few hours,

13:34.900 --> 13:36.560
and I don't know what to do.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.318
In New York, I remember being
so strong and independent.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.159
Now I don't know who I am anymore,

13:42.160 --> 13:46.159
and it's like I-I need
Mike so much out here,

13:46.160 --> 13:47.739
and it scares me.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.959
- Why?
- Because you've always taught me

13:49.960 --> 13:51.914
- to fend for myself.
- Yeah. So?

13:51.915 --> 13:53.479
So how can I be strong and independent

13:53.480 --> 13:55.040
if I need him so much?

13:55.043 --> 13:57.829
Being strong doesn't mean
doing everything on your own.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.079
That's why you have a partner...

13:59.080 --> 14:00.714
so they can be strong when you're not.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.059
Nobody's strong all the time,

14:02.060 --> 14:03.339
except Monica Lewinsky,

14:03.340 --> 14:05.761
and you know I've been at her
side from the very beginning.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.779
But, Rio, you're not losing yourself.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.433
You're just learning how
to rely on each other.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.849
Right.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.314
Hey, Mom.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.939
Were you the one who taught me
to put keys between my fingers

14:19.940 --> 14:21.150
to make them a weapon?

14:21.152 --> 14:22.259
No.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.099
You learned that one on your own.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.819
Remember when you key-holed
that flasher on the subway?

14:26.820 --> 14:30.119
Oh, my God, that was one of the
proudest moments of my life.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.371
What?! Was that the weasel?!

14:32.372 --> 14:33.609
- I got this.
- Rio?

14:33.610 --> 14:34.740
Where'd you go?

14:34.750 --> 14:36.870
- Don't put me down!
- I'm coming for your weasel ass.

14:41.990 --> 14:44.133
Hi, Constance.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.759
Rudy. Why are you here?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.386
A man washed my underwear.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.499
Everyone in this town needs to
learn what an emergency is.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.509
No, wait.

14:51.510 --> 14:53.929
I...

14:53.930 --> 14:56.859
It's really hard for me to change.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.429
But I'd like it if you'd...

14:58.430 --> 15:00.275
ask me out again sometime.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.439
Have a nice evening, Constance.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.216
The doctors know what they're doing.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.859
- Yeah.
- I saw a lot of coolers

15:26.860 --> 15:29.178
when we checked in. I think
this is the place people come.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.839
Let's hope so, huh?

15:30.840 --> 15:32.740
Hey, uh...

15:33.900 --> 15:35.934
... it was me crying on that video.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.429
Oh. Really?

15:37.430 --> 15:39.420
Yeah.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.549
I cry sometimes.

15:46.550 --> 15:48.809
Sure.

15:48.810 --> 15:52.860
I do it alone so nobody
has to see it, but I cry.

15:54.750 --> 15:58.916
Sometimes I... I cry so hard,
I can feel it in my nuts.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.834
Mm.

16:00.835 --> 16:01.919
Do you wanna know why?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.378
You bet I do, Beau.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.005
Farming's not what it used to be.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.539
You think I want to sell bull semen

16:06.540 --> 16:08.969
to the Mudanjiang prefecture in China?

16:08.970 --> 16:10.177
No.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.012
But I had to diversify.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.759
I want to keep that
bull semen for myself

16:13.760 --> 16:15.510
like my dad did, and his dad.

16:15.517 --> 16:18.310
- Sure.
- It kills me that Jacob saw me like that.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.437
Oh, come... Beau.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.099
- Hey.
- Don't look at me right now.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.160
Well, where do you want me to look?

16:23.170 --> 16:25.460
- Just don't look right at me.
- Okay.

16:29.190 --> 16:31.659
Sorry, it's gotta be you.

16:31.660 --> 16:35.059
Listen, I saw my dad cry once.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.179
You know, we were on a long
drive, just the two of us,

16:38.180 --> 16:40.519
when, uh, Bob Seger came on the radio.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.439
Gotta love Bob Seger.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.299
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.979
I mean, my dad's not an emotional guy,

16:46.980 --> 16:49.039
but when "Against The Wind" came on...

16:49.040 --> 16:50.409
Oh!

16:50.410 --> 16:52.949
... boy, that was the whole ballgame.

16:52.950 --> 16:56.619
He told me how it reminded
him of my mom and...

16:56.620 --> 16:59.439
apparently, they had made love
to that song the night before,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.079
which really bummed me out to hear,

17:01.080 --> 17:02.689
but the point remains,

17:02.690 --> 17:04.789
you know, by him opening up like that,

17:04.790 --> 17:06.605
it gave me permission to feel.

17:06.606 --> 17:09.819
You shouldn't be embarrassed
you cried in front of Jacob.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.946
You should be proud of that.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.138
- Mr. Bowman?
- Yeah.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.118
Jacob's doing great.
He's resting right now,

17:14.119 --> 17:15.519
but you can see him in a little bit.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.679
Okay, thank you.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.519
- Thank you.
- He's fine.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.598
That's what we want to hear.

17:19.599 --> 17:20.638
Aah!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.179
He... He... He's fine.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.079
Yeah.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.878
Ugh!

17:31.380 --> 17:32.859
Want me to get us another bag of those?

17:32.860 --> 17:34.160
Don't you... Don't you leave me.

17:34.170 --> 17:35.719
Okay.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.889
- Great.
- Don't you leave me.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.290
Please.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.300
Ugh!

17:50.200 --> 17:54.269
Weasel, I know you don't
understand words,

17:54.270 --> 17:56.349
but I hope that my tone

17:56.350 --> 17:59.479
is soothing and stern enough
for you to understand

17:59.480 --> 18:03.059
that I would really like you to leave.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.090
Ahhhhh! Get off!

18:12.091 --> 18:13.133
Get rid of it!

18:13.134 --> 18:15.029
- Hey, Thumbelina.
- Hey.

18:15.030 --> 18:17.229
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.431
I told them I didn't
need any anesthesia.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.767
And then I do not
remember what happened.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.639
Listen.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.520
This scar?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.899
That S.O.B. hurt so bad I passed out.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.379
Then I woke up covered in urine.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.379
I had peed myself like a newborn.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.560
And then I spit up all over
your mama's wedding dress.

18:35.570 --> 18:38.040
- W-What?
- And Dr. Kentucky Bourbon?

18:38.050 --> 18:40.599
Well, actually a lady doctor

18:40.600 --> 18:41.989
named Millicent G. Tubbs.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.039
The point is, I'm only human.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.620
And that's what you saw on that tape.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.250
And I'm...

18:48.660 --> 18:50.921
I'm so happy that you're okay.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.749
Me too, Dad.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.660
It hurt so much when I cut my
thumb off with that knife!

18:57.650 --> 18:59.669
Oh.

18:59.670 --> 19:00.680
Get outta my way!

19:00.690 --> 19:01.789
My son's in there!

19:01.790 --> 19:02.805
- Mom.
- Jacob!

19:02.806 --> 19:04.300
Oh, my God. My sweet baby.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.728
- Kay.
- Oh, I'm good.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.639
I'm so glad the angels didn't take you.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.340
The angels saved his thumb,
but they took your cooler.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.987
I don't know why I said that.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.470
I would've been here sooner,

19:17.480 --> 19:19.389
but your Aunt Stacy and
I were stuck in a tree

19:19.390 --> 19:20.534
hunting a ten-point buck.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.243
I wanted to nab a six-pointer,

19:22.244 --> 19:24.359
but you know your Aunt
Stacy's a real size queen.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.839
- Right.
- I love you so much.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.080
I love you, Mama.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.799
I don't know what happened here,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.790
but I choose to blame you.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.179
Rio?!

19:39.180 --> 19:40.960
Hon?!

19:41.020 --> 19:42.719
Hello, Mike.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.040
Oh.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.579
Hey. I'm so sorry, but I'm here now,

19:46.580 --> 19:48.604
- and I want to kill the weasel.
- You're too late.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.999
Oh!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.232
Wait, you did this? By yourself?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.400
How?

19:53.401 --> 19:55.110
- You key-holed that mother.
- No, no, no.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.879
He was just sort of
attracted to shiny stuff,

19:56.880 --> 19:57.905
and that sort of did the trick.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.499
- Aah!
- Watch. See, he loves this.

20:01.240 --> 20:03.479
Wow. Thank God. I was nervous one of us

20:03.480 --> 20:05.077
was gonna end up like your cousin Neary.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.999
- How do you know about that?
- Hon, she was at our wedding.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.009
- She was? I don't...
- Remember? Yeah.

20:08.010 --> 20:09.850
Who do you think that
uniformed nurse was with?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.500
- Right?
- Oh.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.044
- Forgot about that.
- Honey, listen.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.005
I want to bake you brownies.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.590
- Yeah?
- Yes.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.379
And I do not want to make you lemonade.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.439
- I want that, too.
- Yeah.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.489
When we got married, I took
your name because we're a team.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.459
And I'm still Mike Levine-Young.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.476
- I cook, I clean...
- Mm-hmm.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.394
... and I make it happen
between the sheets.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.559
- Yes, you do.
- That's who I am.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.897
Oh, my goodness!

20:32.898 --> 20:34.470
- Oh, it's okay.
- Boy, he is angry, huh?

20:34.480 --> 20:36.400
No, this is him at a three.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.443
Should we keep him?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.560
- No, absolutely not.
- No, we won't.

20:39.570 --> 20:40.890
- It's a bad idea.
- Yeah, I know.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.380
Ugh!

20:45.880 --> 20:47.179
- Mm.
- Mm.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.455
Hmm-hmm.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.689
No weighted blanket?

20:49.690 --> 20:50.707
Mnh-mnh.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.790
It's covered in weasel feces.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.449
Mm.

20:54.450 --> 20:57.259
Want me to put on your "Sounds
of the Upper West Side"?

20:57.260 --> 20:58.689
No.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.129
I like the sounds of Nebraska.

21:01.130 --> 21:03.160
Mm.

21:04.550 --> 21:05.597
W-Who's there?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.179
Rudy!

21:07.180 --> 21:08.899
What are you doing here?

21:08.900 --> 21:10.579
I figured it's about time
I did my own laundry.

21:10.580 --> 21:11.699
Yeah, but in our sink?

21:11.700 --> 21:13.354
The washer and dryer
are in the basement.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.439
I don't like being underground.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.442
- Please tell me that's food.
- I hope not.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.486
My underwear's in there.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.879
Hot and fresh.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.159
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.449
Yeah. Right where we eat breakfast.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.492
- Yep, there it is.
- Okay.
