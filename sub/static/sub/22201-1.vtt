00:36.870 --> 00:38.204
Do you know what this is?

00:38.288 --> 00:40.790
It's for Marsha. Marsha Johnson.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.543
- Who's that?
- Well, she was, um...

00:44.919 --> 00:47.964
a transvestite from the Village
who recently died.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.799
She was a big activist.

00:52.802 --> 00:56.598
Um, we're not sure how she died yet.
Murder, maybe?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.937
Marsha Johnson,
a veteran of the Stonewall riots,

01:03.021 --> 01:05.690
and a prominent figure
among transvestites,

01:05.774 --> 01:08.860
was found dead in the river
near Christopher Street, Monday morning.

01:16.701 --> 01:19.829
Marsha, whose real name
was Malcolm Michaels Jr.,

01:19.913 --> 01:21.915
was last seen alive on Thursday.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.966
The police lists suicide
as the cause of death,

01:32.050 --> 01:34.427
but community leaders cite
a lack of evidence,

01:34.511 --> 01:38.014
and charge that police
have yet to begin an investigation

01:38.097 --> 01:41.309
into the death of this beloved founder
of the gay movement.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.604
A demonstration is planned
for next week on Christopher Street.

01:44.687 --> 01:49.400
Marsha was 46 years old and is survived
by four brothers and two sisters.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.444
She will be greatly missed.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.737
Do we have everyone?

02:34.821 --> 02:38.366
Let's start with the most recent incident,
which happened over the weekend.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.161
A 35-year-old transgender woman
was attacked

02:41.244 --> 02:43.913
outside of her home
in Jackson Heights, Queens.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.833
Um, last we heard was that the survivor

02:46.916 --> 02:49.586
is not yet conscious
or able to communicate,

02:49.669 --> 02:52.380
and they've not been in a position
where we could offer support.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.759
She had her head smashed
against the curb of a sidewalk

02:56.843 --> 03:01.472
by, uh, someone who has fled
and has not yet been apprehended.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.557
Keep us posted.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.975
And let us know
what you need.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.687
Remember, the Nettles case is back
in court this Friday.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.397
Yeah, we'll be there.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.623
I've been working for the LGBTQ
Anti-Violence project for many years,

03:26.706 --> 03:28.833
and I'm about to retire.

03:30.001 --> 03:34.047
But there's a massive number
of trans women who have been murdered,

03:34.130 --> 03:36.591
and their cases have just gone cold.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.221
And they're yelling out
from their graves...

03:42.513 --> 03:43.598
for justice.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.185
Most of them were unknown,

03:47.268 --> 03:50.355
but even famous people, cases go cold,
just like Marsha.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.941
Marsha was famous all around the world.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.986
Her case has been cold for 25 years.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.659
If we can't bring justice for Marsha,

04:02.742 --> 04:06.537
how can we bring justice
for all these other unsolved cases?

04:09.832 --> 04:13.378
I wanna try to give Marsha justice
before I leave.

04:22.136 --> 04:26.474
This is the memorial
that the street people laid down,

04:26.557 --> 04:30.395
where they laid Marsha's body
when they pulled Marsha out of the water.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.356
Right over the edge here.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.323
You're looking for '92, right?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.867
It was July of '92.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.830
Everyone knew Marsha.
Marsha was so full of life.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.291
It's hard for me to believe
that she would commit suicide.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.464
Yeah, this is her case.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.687
- I was there when they pulled her out.
- Yeah?

05:12.770 --> 05:15.148
Where did you see her floating?

05:15.231 --> 05:16.482
Right over there.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.402
She was about this...
Right there, let's say.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.529
And the head was up
and the feet were down.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.365
She wasn't floating flat,
she was floating down.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.075
And she had a hole in her head.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.873
How do you know
she had a hole in her head?

05:31.956 --> 05:34.083
- I could see it.
- Really?

05:34.167 --> 05:36.836
- You can't judge that...
- It could be the fish...

05:36.919 --> 05:39.589
I'm just saying it was a hole.
I'm not saying what happened.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.050
All I'm telling you is what I saw.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.260
She didn't look anything like we knew her.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.293
Isn't this calming
and nice to come here?

06:17.376 --> 06:21.714
They set aside this whole pier for us
so we could come and relax here.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.721
Marsha!

06:28.805 --> 06:32.266
Marsha Johnson,
Queen of the Village. One of the great...

06:32.350 --> 06:34.602
This is one of the most courageous people
in the world.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.187
I've always loved...

06:36.270 --> 06:39.023
I always wanted to put on drag
and I never had the courage.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.317
This is one of the people
that has the courage.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.404
And bravo for him. Her.
Or whatever he wants to be.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.739
And not only that, he doesn't give a shit

06:46.823 --> 06:49.992
whether he wears men's clothes
or women's clothes.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.328
- Right? He's totally free.
- Right. That's right.

06:52.411 --> 06:55.289
If he feels like going out as a man,
he goes out as a man.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.000
- He feels like a woman, he's a woman.
- How do you know all this?

06:58.084 --> 07:01.587
If he feels like wearing roller skates,
he wears roller skates. Whatever.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.506
I know Marsha Johnson.

07:03.589 --> 07:08.553
Marsha Johnson is our queen forever.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.354
You have reached
the Office of Chief Medical Examiner

07:18.438 --> 07:19.981
for the City of New York.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.650
My name is Victoria Cruz

07:22.733 --> 07:28.823
and I'm inquiring about a Malcolm Michaels
who was found dead in 1992.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.575
There was an autopsy.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.911
How would I be able to get
this particular information?

07:33.995 --> 07:35.496
Are you calling
from the media or...

07:35.580 --> 07:38.749
I'm calling from the Anti-Violence Project
here in New York City.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.461
I can give you the cause of death
and the manner of death.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.838
You would not be entitled
to a full autopsy report.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.174
If you're looking for all that paperwork,

07:46.257 --> 07:49.093
then the family needs to request it
in a written letter,

07:49.177 --> 07:51.345
and you can get the record that way.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.357
907.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.656
"The Michaels family."

08:14.744 --> 08:15.578
How are you?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.663
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, too.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.124
Here, I'll take this one
'cause it's much easier to get up from.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.459
- Okay.
- Okay, go ahead.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.543
Okay.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.462
What do you know about the case?

08:24.545 --> 08:27.340
I really don't know anything.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.551
All we know is that
they found him in the river.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.053
We really don't know anything about that.

08:32.135 --> 08:33.971
That's what
we're investigating,

08:34.054 --> 08:38.893
'cause we have eyewitnesses
that report seeing him... her...

08:38.976 --> 08:41.645
What do you prefer me...
for me to call Marsha?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.481
- It doesn't matter. Okay.
- Okay.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.234
When was the last time you saw her alive?

08:46.317 --> 08:47.860
We saw her before the Fourth of July.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.904
- Monday? Tuesday?
- I don't know what day that was.

08:49.987 --> 08:50.988
It was during the week.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.242
She stopped by our house
and I took him to the train station.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.327
- He got on the train and that was it.
- Okay.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.581
Next thing we know, we got a phone call
saying that he was dead.

09:00.665 --> 09:04.293
Yeah, we sure did.
We went to New York and everything.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.879
And did you request
to see the body or no?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.589
My sister asked, they told her no.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.050
They couldn't.
They're not allowed to do that.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.134
Okay.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.845
This is the letter that we requested

09:14.929 --> 09:18.307
in order to get the autopsy report,
toxicology report

09:18.391 --> 09:21.060
and the pictures, if some were taken.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.522
And hopefully, we can bring
some closure to her case.

09:25.356 --> 09:30.027
Because to me, she was the Rosa Parks
of the LGBT movement.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.699
- You miss her?
- Yes, I miss him.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.369
He adopted the name
of Marsha "Pay It No Mind."

09:38.953 --> 09:41.455
Pay it no mind.
That's your problem, not mine.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.002
Anything he did,
he'd have you laughing.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.753
When he told us stories,
we didn't believe him.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.756
I'd tell him, "You're lying.
You didn't know Andy Warhol.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.550
- You didn't know those people."
- Yes, she did!

09:52.633 --> 09:55.553
She knew a lot of famous people.
She was famous herself.

09:56.345 --> 09:59.390
Well, she told us. We...
I didn't believe her.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.434
I thought he was joking.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.352
Only thing that Marsha couldn't do
was sing.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.605
- Horrible. Horrible.
- No, no. No.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.774
He could not sing.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.067
And now,
ladies and gentlemen...

10:11.152 --> 10:12.778
Miss Marsha P. Johnson!

11:25.726 --> 11:27.269
- Hi, Randy. Remember me?
- Hi.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.313
Yes. You look very familiar.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.233
- Yes. How are you? I like your shirt.
- Fine. And yourself?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.193
You got the same button, huh?

11:34.276 --> 11:36.278
- Yeah, how do you like that?
- How are you?

11:37.113 --> 11:40.074
- Well, come on in the living room.
- Okay.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.743
As you see,
Marsha's a big part of my life.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.370
Yes, I know.

11:44.453 --> 11:48.541
In my opinion, I want that picture someday
to be in the Schomburg Museum.

11:48.624 --> 11:54.338
They call her "Andy Warhol model,
prostitute, starring actress and saint."

11:55.798 --> 11:58.217
- Where'd you meet Marsha?
- Uh...

11:59.844 --> 12:03.472
I had a kid who lived with me,
who was like an adopted son, Roy.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.975
That's a picture of Roy and Marsha
right there.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.978
And one night, it was, like,
five degrees outside.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.189
He said, "Could Marsha come
and sleep on the living room floor?"

12:12.898 --> 12:16.694
So Marsha came in that night
and stayed for the next 12 years.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.530
What do you think
happened to her?

12:19.613 --> 12:23.826
Well, it certainly was not suicide.
That was an insult to the family.

12:23.909 --> 12:27.288
No way could Marsha in any way
have committed suicide.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.665
But let's face it.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.334
The police department,
they had made up their mind.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.712
"This case is over with.
We don't wanna be bothered.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.257
'Cause this is a nobody.
This isn't a person."

12:38.340 --> 12:39.300
Let me ask you a question.

12:39.383 --> 12:44.889
Would you be able to give us any contacts
or information that you may have?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.939
I have worked
to make this place more accessible.

12:58.527 --> 13:02.323
Somewhere I have a printout
of the names and contacts

13:02.406 --> 13:06.118
that I consider to be
the best leads.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.208
Oh, okay. Yeah. I found that.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.171
We began down at the river.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.048
Who's "we"?

13:19.131 --> 13:23.010
A group of Marsha's friends.
Maybe 20 people.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.428
And this was the...

13:25.513 --> 13:27.431
And the police have written us off

13:27.515 --> 13:29.141
as marginalized citizens.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.852
That was the memorial
at the pier.

13:31.936 --> 13:36.482
That was where her body laid
and damaged the sidewalk.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.067
Well, I just meant...

13:38.943 --> 13:43.197
What we're really here today to talk about
is what we're gonna do

13:43.280 --> 13:48.285
about this loss of a national treasure,
this icon of the gay community,

13:48.369 --> 13:50.871
this fire at Stonewall.

13:52.414 --> 13:56.418
The cops aren't doing their job.
They're just sitting on their fat asses.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.587
We have to send a message to these people.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.756
We demand justice here.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.972
Join us. Sixth precinct is not
doing their job again.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.140
We want some answers!

14:10.224 --> 14:13.561
I knew Marsha.
Marsha was the happiest person I knew.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.396
Yeah. Yes, she was.

14:15.479 --> 14:20.150
Do their job! Do their job!
Do their job! Do their job!

14:20.234 --> 14:22.152
We know that this wasn't
a suicide.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.946
You guys closed your books on it
and decided,

14:24.029 --> 14:25.698
because she's a marginal citizen,

14:25.781 --> 14:28.284
that you weren't going to do
anything about it.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.035
We don't agree with that,

14:30.119 --> 14:32.496
and we want you guys
to do your fucking jobs.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.583
My name is Randy Wicker.
I was the deceased's roommate.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.794
I think the problem is that,
first, it's been classified as a suicide,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.547
and I came to believe that
there was a good chance of foul play

14:41.630 --> 14:43.883
'cause she was talking about
the Mafia after her

14:43.966 --> 14:45.050
and in a very bad state.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.802
And we may never know what happened.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.096
But we wanna see
this investigation proceed

14:49.179 --> 14:50.848
in an orderly and thorough manner.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.517
And that the investigation will continue
to accumulate evidence

14:53.601 --> 14:54.894
if new evidence does become available.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.647
I don't think that it's possible
for you to schedule a meeting

14:58.731 --> 15:02.067
that will resolve this problem
to your satisfaction today.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.485
I don't think that's possible.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.156
We want justice here,
to find out who the hell murdered Marsha,

15:07.239 --> 15:12.119
while you fucking people are standing here
not doing your fucking jobs!

15:12.202 --> 15:15.623
- Justice for Marsha!
- Justice for Marsha!

15:29.887 --> 15:31.889
My name is Sylvia Rivera,

15:31.972 --> 15:36.101
and I'm giving permission
to have this filmed.

15:38.020 --> 15:42.399
When I met Marsha,
I must've been 12 years old.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.694
She was like a mother to me.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.366
Marsha was an icon of the gay movement.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.202
Marsha was known through the world.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.830
Marsha and I, we were the liberators.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.333
And the street people
and the drag queens were...

16:00.501 --> 16:02.962
the vanguard of the movement.

16:03.045 --> 16:07.424
We were the ones that stood the forefront
and fought the cops off.

16:07.508 --> 16:11.804
And we're the ones that didn't mind
getting our heads bashed in.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.973
When I first came to the Stonewall,

16:14.056 --> 16:17.059
I was the only drag queen there,
just about.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.439
I said, "Honey, what do you think,
I'm a boy or a girl?"

16:22.523 --> 16:25.150
They didn't answer,
so I decided to go in.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.989
'Cause it was a all-men's bar.

16:38.122 --> 16:43.460
The Stonewall was
a very nice campy little bar

16:43.544 --> 16:46.046
owned by the Mafia, you know.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.342
Gay people were not allowed in bars.

16:50.426 --> 16:54.722
The Mafia would pay off the cops.
Typical of that era.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.890
It was hard being a drag queen back then

16:56.974 --> 17:00.894
because they would take us into jail
for no reason at all.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.397
We lived in an era that was unreal.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.164
I was spaced out on black beauties
and scotch.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.208
We would dance, my lover and I.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.088
The next thing we know,
the lights came on and...

17:28.172 --> 17:29.798
Hey, we're being raided.

17:33.802 --> 17:37.556
Queens started being filed out
and being put into police cars,

17:37.639 --> 17:39.975
and guns had been drawn.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.770
Molotov cocktails were flying.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.566
And I'm like, "Oh, my God,
the revolution is here. Thank God."

17:48.150 --> 17:50.986
You've been treating us like shit
all these years?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.614
Uh-uh. Now it's our turn.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.331
When I got downtown,
the place was already on fire.

18:02.414 --> 18:06.376
Sylvia Rivera and them were
over in the park having a cocktail.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.879
And we were in the streets
turning over cars

18:08.962 --> 18:11.673
and, oh, my dear, blocking traffic

18:11.757 --> 18:14.968
and screaming and hollering
and everything.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.597
I mean, there was a lot of bloodshed
that night.

18:20.849 --> 18:24.520
And the movement started the next day.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.694
The world is having to notice
what it used to try to ignore.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.489
Homosexuals no longer meekly melt away

18:35.572 --> 18:38.575
under the blast of scorn,
ridicule or hatred.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.203
Today's gay power people are struggling

18:41.286 --> 18:45.666
for full economic and legal recognition
and acceptance.

18:49.461 --> 18:54.383
- Why are you here today?
- Darling, I want my gay rights now.

18:54.466 --> 18:59.346
I think it's about time the gay brothers
and sisters got their rights.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.850
And especially the women.

19:02.933 --> 19:08.647
Marsha was very good-natured.
She was funny. She laughed.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.692
But that shouldn't be mistaken

19:11.775 --> 19:16.321
for a lack of serious purpose
and political intent.

19:16.905 --> 19:22.119
Her mission in life is
going about spreading peace and goodwill.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.664
Giving license to, "You don't have to be
dressed up in a suit."

19:25.747 --> 19:27.457
You can express yourself.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.669
She became, to me, like a bodhisattva.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.797
A holy person who would wander the Village

19:33.881 --> 19:37.634
in whatever adornment she wanted,
being at peace.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.137
How will this affect your job?

19:40.220 --> 19:43.390
Darling, I don't have a job.
I'm on welfare.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.517
I have no intentions of getting a job

19:45.601 --> 19:48.729
as long as this country discriminates
against homosexuals.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.147
Right on.

19:50.230 --> 19:54.443
Justice!
Justice! Justice! Justice!

19:54.526 --> 19:57.196
Sylvia was always very outspoken.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.366
She was unrelenting.
She was... Sylvia was very in-your-face.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.745
Very intense eyes. A slash of a mouth.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.956
A guttural laugh like Marlene Dietrich.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.209
Sylvia was quite the serious one.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.753
She pushed her way to the front line.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.797
"Homes for the homeless!
Food for the poor!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.382
Gay rights! Gay rights!"

20:17.466 --> 20:18.550
P!

20:18.634 --> 20:20.594
- O!
- O!

20:20.677 --> 20:22.554
- W!
- W!

20:22.638 --> 20:24.556
- E!
- E!

20:24.640 --> 20:26.225
- R!
- R!

20:26.308 --> 20:28.477
- Tell me what!
- Gay power!

20:28.560 --> 20:31.063
- I can't hear you!
- Gay power!

20:31.146 --> 20:32.606
A little bit louder!

20:32.689 --> 20:34.775
Gay power!

20:39.738 --> 20:45.369
After a while, I think they knew
that they most had to concentrate

20:45.452 --> 20:48.622
on the area
that no one was addressing for them,

20:48.705 --> 20:52.793
and that only they could address.
And that was being transgender.

20:54.211 --> 20:58.757
Marsha and I thought one day
we needed to do something for our own.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.509
That's where STAR was born.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.220
Street Transvestites
Action Revolutionaries.

21:06.431 --> 21:10.435
Sylvia Lee Rivera deserves
all the credit for STAR.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.813
I was just one of the queens
that was behind her,

21:12.896 --> 21:14.982
like the vice president of STAR.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.234
She knew exactly
what she was talking about.

21:17.317 --> 21:21.697
She was talking about nobody's
representing transvestites, ya know?

21:24.658 --> 21:27.244
The one thing they had in common
which bonded them,

21:27.327 --> 21:30.038
why their name
should always be connected,

21:30.122 --> 21:33.000
is that they helped those
who were on the street,

21:33.083 --> 21:35.043
just trying to live their lives.

21:35.127 --> 21:39.214
And a lot of them got on the street
and ended up hooking or hustling

21:39.298 --> 21:42.092
to make a buck,
and they sometimes had no place to stay.

21:44.469 --> 21:49.141
Marsha and I started STAR House
to keep the kids off the streets.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.106
To get these kids
get their things together.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.695
STAR was part
of the people's revolution,

22:01.778 --> 22:06.908
and it was time for us to show the world
that we are human beings.

22:09.411 --> 22:13.957
I didn't know Marsha, but I
became very close friends with Sylvia.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.962
Back in the late '60s,

22:19.046 --> 22:22.507
I was going out with Frankie,
who was a bouncer at the Stonewall.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.218
Frankie was always cheating on me,

22:25.302 --> 22:28.805
and he was going out
with Sylvia's best friend at the time.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.517
Sylvia and I didn’t get along too well,

22:32.601 --> 22:36.396
so I had lost sight of her for 25 years.

22:36.480 --> 22:41.818
One day I went to a meeting,
and who was there? Sylvia.

22:41.902 --> 22:47.532
She sat right across from me,
and she got up and she says, "I know you."

22:47.616 --> 22:49.951
And I got up, too,
and I says, "I know you, too."

22:50.035 --> 22:54.706
And then this button,
she had it on her left side,

22:54.790 --> 22:59.169
popped out and it just rolled to my feet.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.505
So one of the girls picked it up
and Sylvia says,

23:01.588 --> 23:04.549
"No, give it to her. She's one of us."

23:05.550 --> 23:08.970
And from that moment on,
we became very close friends.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.723
We spoke to each other
at least twice a week.

23:11.807 --> 23:15.185
And she was always there
for me and the community.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.062
And I will never forget that.

23:18.563 --> 23:22.192
When she spoke about Marsha,
there was always a tear in her eyes.

23:22.275 --> 23:26.363
She loved Marsha, and she said that
that was our mother.

23:28.198 --> 23:31.451
What's been going on
with the Marsha P. Johnson case?

23:31.535 --> 23:35.205
There seems to be conflicting evidence
on the last time she was seen.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.792
Randy said he last saw her on the second.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.962
- Thank you very much, doll.
- My pleasure.

23:42.045 --> 23:47.092
And then someone reported
seeing her on the night of the fourth.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.469
And the body was found on the sixth.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.307
So we're gonna ask more questions
of people who knew her

23:54.391 --> 23:57.310
or reported seeing her during that time.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.814
And that's what we're trying to find out.
We'll get to the bottom of it.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.108
Okay.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.422
Please leave a message
after the tone. When...

24:31.845 --> 24:32.971
Can I help you?

24:33.054 --> 24:36.391
Yes. May I speak to Daniel Massanova?

24:36.474 --> 24:38.935
That's me. What's the matter?
What's up?

24:39.728 --> 24:43.190
Daniel, my name is Victoria Cruz.
I work for the Anti-Violence Project.

24:43.273 --> 24:47.485
I'm working on a reopened case
from 1992...

24:47.569 --> 24:50.864
- What was the name of the victim?
- Marsha P. Johnson.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.575
Are you talking
about the girl off the water?

24:53.658 --> 24:54.951
Yes.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.454
Yeah, that was Jimmy Abreu's case.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.415
Jimmy is retired like I am from the NYPD.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.709
Okay, you wouldn't happen
to have his number, would you?

25:02.792 --> 25:04.044
No, I don't.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.344
I'm trying to get in contact
with a James Abreu.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.887
I'm not familiar with that.

25:16.598 --> 25:21.686
I don't know that person.
There is nobody here named James Abreu.

25:29.027 --> 25:32.239
- Daryl.
- I'm looking for a James Abreu.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.951
Yeah, hold on. Jimmy, phone call.

25:36.534 --> 25:37.535
Hello?

25:37.619 --> 25:39.454
- James Abreu?
- Yes.

25:39.537 --> 25:43.291
Hi, my name is Victoria Cruz.
I'm working for the Anti-Violence Project.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.462
I'm working on a reopened case
on the Marsha P. Johnson case

25:47.545 --> 25:52.425
that was... She was found in 1992
by Christopher Street Pier.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.426
Right.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.513
Can I meet with you
in reference to this particular case?

25:56.596 --> 25:57.931
Definitely not.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.350
Because?

26:00.433 --> 26:04.271
Because I'm retired from the NYPD
and you're calling me at work.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.940
Can we meet outside of your job?

26:07.023 --> 26:09.025
No, definitely not.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.778
I don't want to meet
in regards to anything.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.203
He didn't want to tell me
anything about the case.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.121
He doesn't wanna look back.

26:21.204 --> 26:22.914
I can't control
what people say to you.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.791
- I understand.
- I don't know who you represent.

26:24.874 --> 26:28.295
I don't even know
if you are who you say you are.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.340
- Are you a lawyer?
- No, I'm not.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.175
- You a private investigator?
- No.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.637
How about I give you a little advice?
Don't play detective yourself.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.015
Leave this to the people
that should handle it.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.209
Okay.

27:09.836 --> 27:12.672
This is me in '67.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.510
Look at the hairdos.

27:19.846 --> 27:25.268
I was doing shows at the time.
I just loved the stage.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.648
Oh.

27:33.151 --> 27:37.989
I used to do the catwalk in the city
till they found out I was trans,

27:38.073 --> 27:40.658
and then I got booted out.

27:42.994 --> 27:48.500
Back in the '60s, it was against the law
to be dressed in drag.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.086
I was very fortunate
that I was small and petite,

27:51.169 --> 27:54.130
so I really wasn't detectable.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.759
I was very careful
not to get arrested.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.433
X-rated.

28:07.310 --> 28:12.148
This is my beach outfit,
when I had the body.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.568
I had a 24-inch waist.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.034
I've been very blessed and lucky
that my family accepted me.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.328
As a matter of fact,
my mother was a dressmaker,

28:25.412 --> 28:27.330
and she was very supportive.

28:30.291 --> 28:34.045
This was a friend of mine
who got murdered back in '73.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.508
This is him in drag. Carlos Sanchez.

28:40.552 --> 28:44.931
We never found out who did it or...
Cold case.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.562
They just didn't care.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.021
They were trans.

28:54.023 --> 28:57.068
Outcasts. Society doesn't want them.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.655
I've dealt with those feelings...

29:01.448 --> 29:03.616
my own personal experiences.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.495
- Victoria?
- Miss Kitty?

29:48.578 --> 29:49.621
Hi.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.372
- How are you?
- Thank you so much for coming.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.749
Thank you for allowing me to come.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.419
- Thank you.
- Sit, please.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.545
Thank you so much.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.507
You're more than welcome. Thank you.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.801
So, I heard so much about you.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.302
And was it good or bad?

30:04.385 --> 30:07.305
- It's all interesting.
- Yes.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.098
How did you meet Marsha?

30:09.182 --> 30:12.685
I was probably 13 or 14 at the time.

30:13.353 --> 30:16.689
I would always pass Sheridan Square Park.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.067
And when I first saw Marsha,

30:19.150 --> 30:26.115
she was just this elaborate,
with feathers and plumes and...

30:26.199 --> 30:30.829
makeup that was never put on correctly.

30:31.746 --> 30:35.792
And Marsha was all,
"Honey, you are fabulous,"

30:35.875 --> 30:38.837
and, "You would make a beautiful girl."

30:38.920 --> 30:43.258
She used to come by
and snatch my hair up on both sides,

30:43.341 --> 30:45.677
and it made me feel so special.

30:45.760 --> 30:51.391
It made me feel like
I wanted to be a part of that crowd.

30:51.474 --> 30:55.979
And Marsha and I remained great friends
up until the day she died.

30:56.062 --> 30:59.774
Have you seen this?
This was a flyer that was given out.

30:59.858 --> 31:04.320
I remember this poster
being posted in the window of Uplift,

31:04.404 --> 31:06.823
which was Randy Wicker's store.

31:06.906 --> 31:10.368
And Randy had, like,
this little memorial going on right there.

31:10.451 --> 31:12.579
Yes, I do remember this.

31:21.838 --> 31:25.258
I had went in there once or twice
after Marsha's death.

31:25.341 --> 31:29.512
Just to pay my respects to him
and offer my condolences to him.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.097
I actually never read this.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.141
"Malcolm, 46..."

31:33.725 --> 31:35.393
Oh, Anvil icon.

31:35.476 --> 31:38.646
Amazing, because the night
that she was murdered,

31:38.730 --> 31:41.190
her and I were supposed to
go to the Anvil together.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.568
Okay, tell me about that time.

31:43.651 --> 31:46.195
I wanna say it was the Fourth of July.

31:48.197 --> 31:53.161
I ran into Marsha in front of
the Christopher Street bookstore,

31:53.244 --> 31:56.539
and it was broad daylight.
She was in full drag.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.543
- How intoxicated was she?
- Marsha was always in her right mind.

32:00.627 --> 32:05.840
She always knew
what the main prize was, you know.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.762
We separated,
and we were gonna meet at midnight,

32:10.845 --> 32:13.556
and we were gonna
troll the streets back and forth.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.391
And we were gonna go to the Anvil,

32:15.475 --> 32:18.436
like, at the usual time,
it was 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.

32:18.519 --> 32:20.396
But she never showed up.

32:21.689 --> 32:25.443
And then, later, I remember...

32:27.195 --> 32:29.238
I was down by the Stroll.

32:34.577 --> 32:38.623
The girl stroll, the queen stroll,
was on that left side.

32:38.706 --> 32:42.835
On the right side was
where all the boys used to do their thing.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.295
The butch queens.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.677
I remember the girls had put me on point.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.428
"Miss Kitty, watch out.

32:52.512 --> 32:56.307
There's a car full of guidos,
you know, just driving around."

32:57.392 --> 33:02.021
And later that evening, I heard
that Marsha had gotten in the car.

33:04.899 --> 33:08.236
The thing is...
Yeah, we told her not to get in that car.

33:13.574 --> 33:17.036
And I never saw her again
after that, you know.

33:18.371 --> 33:23.209
The police from the Sixth Precinct,
they just brushed it off like...

33:24.252 --> 33:27.630
like another one bites the dust
type of thing, you know.

33:29.340 --> 33:33.136
You know,
it kind of makes me think, Victoria,

33:33.219 --> 33:36.806
what happens when a flower gets wilted?

33:38.433 --> 33:42.103
Does it just die away and it's forgotten?

33:44.022 --> 33:47.191
Well, hopefully, that flower
would have shed some seeds

33:47.275 --> 33:49.527
- that will grow into a movement.
- Right.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.447
That's what I hope.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.416
Police are investigating
a possible hate crime

34:03.499 --> 34:05.918
that led to the death
of a transgender woman.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.338
Twenty-one-year-old
Islan Nettles was attacked on the street.

34:09.422 --> 34:13.092
Nettles was out with another
transgender female, a friend.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.136
Police say the pair
met a group of men who attacked them

34:15.219 --> 34:18.097
once they realized Nettles and her friend
weren't born as females.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.224
The friend tells investigators,

34:20.308 --> 34:21.976
when she ran away to get help,

34:22.060 --> 34:26.147
the suspect was on top of Nettles,
punching her in the face.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.900
Nettles was punched
in the head, hit the ground.

34:28.983 --> 34:31.569
She lapsed into a coma and later died.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.987
Twenty-year-old James Dixon

34:33.071 --> 34:34.947
faced a judge
here at Manhattan Criminal Court.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.699
He's charged with manslaughter
and assault.

34:37.784 --> 34:41.661
This person beat my baby
with their bare hands to death.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.498
And I don't feel
he should walk in the streets

34:44.581 --> 34:46.333
'cause my baby can't walk.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.594
He faces anything
between 5 and 25 years.

34:56.677 --> 35:01.224
The child was murdered in August of 2013.

35:01.307 --> 35:04.143
And this has been going on,
we're going on three years already.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.020
The family's been in limbo.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.149
This is a very important case.
This place should be packed.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.111
There should be people outside
that couldn't get in the door.

35:14.445 --> 35:17.323
We had the gay marriage.
Everyone was out for gay marriage.

35:17.406 --> 35:20.326
We used to march these streets
up and down.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.789
We got arrested over here.
We handcuffed ourselves to that thing.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.083
The privileged people,
they got their gay marriage,

35:27.166 --> 35:29.961
and now they're off...
They're gone.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.380
And they've left
the transgender community behind.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.216
What about the rest of the community?
What about the T?

35:35.299 --> 35:39.345
Remember the T? LGBT, you know?

35:44.976 --> 35:51.774
As long as my people don't have
their rights all across America,

35:51.858 --> 35:53.693
there's no reason for celebration.

35:55.069 --> 35:58.781
That's how come I've been walking
for gay rights all these years.

35:58.865 --> 36:03.661
And in 1973,
they told me and Sylvia Rivera

36:03.744 --> 36:05.913
that we get to lead the Gay Pride march,

36:05.997 --> 36:08.624
the transvestites
in the front of the parade.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.711
Honey, they chickens put
all of the drag queens

36:11.794 --> 36:14.213
way in the back someplace.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.341
Honey, that was not the right thing to do.

36:17.425 --> 36:21.095
They don't care if you were there
at the beginning of the gay movement,

36:21.179 --> 36:23.181
demonstrating in drag with them.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.266
They don't care.

36:31.147 --> 36:35.526
Transgender people felt
that they were being pushed to the side.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.613
That their place at Stonewall,

36:38.696 --> 36:41.782
that their place from the beginning
was being forgotten.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.995
I had been promised
a spot to speak.

36:46.078 --> 36:49.624
And they were having a conflict
about the drag queens on stage.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.667
Because we were supposed
to be stereotypes.

36:51.751 --> 36:55.504
But if it wasn't for a drag queen,
there would be no gay liberation movement.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.881
We're the frontliners.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.801
I said, "Well, I'm gonna speak
one way or the other."

37:03.179 --> 37:06.933
One person, a man,
Sylvia gets up here, and...

37:07.016 --> 37:10.937
Just a moment, just a moment.
I would like to avoid any trouble.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.106
This is a day of unity for us.
I want us to be happy.

37:16.442 --> 37:17.526
Sylvia!

37:24.575 --> 37:25.910
Hi, baby!

37:48.349 --> 37:51.060
You all better quiet down!

37:57.566 --> 38:00.444
I've been trying to get up here all day

38:00.528 --> 38:06.242
for your gay brothers
and your gay sisters in jail!

38:06.325 --> 38:10.121
They're writing me
every motherfuckin' week,

38:10.204 --> 38:13.499
and ask for your help!

38:13.582 --> 38:17.420
And you all don't do
a goddamn thing for them!

38:19.005 --> 38:22.091
And they write STAR,
not the women's group.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.761
They do not write women.
They do not write men.

38:25.845 --> 38:30.391
They write STAR because
we're trying to do something for them.

38:30.474 --> 38:35.855
But you all tell me
go and hide my tail between my legs.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.774
I will not put up with this shit!

38:38.858 --> 38:42.945
I have been beaten.
I have had my nose broken.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.947
I have been thrown in jail.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.116
I have lost my job.

38:47.199 --> 38:50.995
I have lost my apartment
for gay liberation.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.289
And you all treat me this way?

38:53.372 --> 38:56.042
What the fuck's wrong with you all?

38:56.125 --> 38:57.918
Think about that!

38:59.253 --> 39:02.256
I believe in the gay power.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.633
I believe in us getting our rights,

39:04.717 --> 39:08.429
or else I would not be out there
fighting for our rights.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.223
That's all I wanted to say to your people.

39:11.307 --> 39:15.644
Come and see your people
at STAR House on 12th Street.

39:15.728 --> 39:19.482
The people that are trying
to do something for all of us,

39:19.565 --> 39:25.571
and not men and women
that belong to a white middle class club!

39:25.654 --> 39:28.366
And that's what you all belong to!

39:29.116 --> 39:31.577
Revolution now!

39:32.870 --> 39:35.956
Gay... Gay power.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.878
Louder! Gay power!

39:53.391 --> 39:56.602
I was hurt, and I felt that...

39:57.436 --> 40:00.940
the movement had completely betrayed...

40:02.024 --> 40:04.735
the drag queens and the street people.

40:06.987 --> 40:11.992
And I felt that the years that
I had already given them had been a waste.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.746
So, I went home, locked up the house.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.707
If it wasn't for Marsha,
I wouldn't be here right now.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.669
I got 60 stitches in this arm.

40:21.752 --> 40:24.964
She came home
and found me bleeding to death.

40:30.469 --> 40:33.639
After the march of 1973...

40:34.473 --> 40:36.809
I left the movement.

40:45.192 --> 40:48.112
I found myself up in Westchester.

40:50.990 --> 40:55.703
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the Music Hall in Tarrytown.

40:55.786 --> 41:01.083
I want to give special thanks to everyone
in the audience for still supporting us.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.177
Of course,
you get the first strange looks.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.387
Ain't bothering me.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.682
Next thing,
you become friends with everybody.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.104
I feel that I have liberated
a lot of people

41:22.188 --> 41:26.233
just by living here in the suburbs,
just by being myself.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.070
Just by being a campy queen.

41:30.946 --> 41:33.324
And they appreciate. They really do.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.874
That's how I was letting out
most of my anger.

41:42.833 --> 41:45.711
But I will not forgive the movement

41:45.794 --> 41:50.508
for anything that they have done
to my community.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.706
- Give me a hug, girl.
- A hug. I'm sorry.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.334
Yes, girl. Oh, good to see you.

42:25.417 --> 42:28.087
- Mmm!
- Mmm. Nice hug.

42:28.170 --> 42:31.048
Yeah, I like to give good hugs.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.716
- Good hugs.
- So, can I open this?

42:32.800 --> 42:34.385
- Sure.
- Thank you.

42:34.468 --> 42:36.679
- You can light it up if you like, too.
- Light it up?

42:36.762 --> 42:37.805
Incense.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.349
Chelsea, come here, girl.
What's the matter with you?

42:40.432 --> 42:43.686
- Give me a hug, baby. Blessed be.
- Blessed be. How you doin'?

42:46.397 --> 42:50.776
Anything you may be able to tell me
may be very, very helpful.

42:50.859 --> 42:54.655
I don't know anything that you can't get
better from Randy Wicker.

42:56.532 --> 42:59.660
Maybe you can tell me about the cops
that were around during that time?

42:59.743 --> 43:01.203
- I really can't.
- You can't?

43:01.287 --> 43:03.289
- No.
- All right.

43:03.831 --> 43:09.420
You went on an investigation
in a white van with Randy. Remember that?

43:12.631 --> 43:13.924
Do you always smoke this much,

43:14.008 --> 43:16.385
or is this just because
you're a little nervous?

43:16.468 --> 43:19.638
I always smoke this much
when I'm down here, baby.

43:22.141 --> 43:25.185
Honey, this is a fishing expedition.
We'll either catch something or we won't.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.104
We're just kind of trolling.

43:29.398 --> 43:30.482
Um...

43:31.775 --> 43:33.944
Let's start all over.

43:34.028 --> 43:39.325
Randy wanted to talk about Marsha
and how Marsha had died,

43:39.408 --> 43:41.910
and how we suspected
that she was murdered.

43:44.413 --> 43:48.626
And could I make some highly irregular
and very unofficial inquiries.

43:48.709 --> 43:52.254
And I did, and I really didn't come up
with anything. I wish I had.

43:53.797 --> 43:55.007
Where do you wanna go?

43:55.090 --> 43:57.468
I want to park the van.
We're gonna go talk to the girls.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.552
Yeah.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.722
You're gonna be out that back window
with the camera.

44:02.931 --> 44:05.434
Close the door
so the lights go off.

44:08.145 --> 44:12.191
You know, I asked around the piers
and in the neighborhood.

44:12.274 --> 44:15.569
And asked around
because I knew a lot of the girls

44:15.653 --> 44:17.279
that were just walking around,

44:17.363 --> 44:19.657
looking into matters
on my own, or whatever.

44:24.453 --> 44:27.164
How long have you
been involved in this?

44:27.247 --> 44:28.832
Twelve years.

44:29.583 --> 44:32.252
You're on the street,
with no place to go and no money.

44:33.128 --> 44:35.964
Most of these girls are underage.

44:36.048 --> 44:39.718
Most of them are more throwaways
than runaways.

44:42.137 --> 44:46.934
And the older ones are people like me
that started out when we were young and...

44:47.017 --> 44:49.853
- You're a survivor, then.
- Yes.

44:52.731 --> 44:56.068
I'm practically the only one still alive
from the girls I first started with.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.115
What happened to most of them?

45:01.740 --> 45:04.535
Drug overdoses, suicides...

45:05.536 --> 45:08.664
murdered by johns, murdered by pimps.

45:08.747 --> 45:12.292
A lot of girls plain fucking disappear
the way Marsha did.

45:13.293 --> 45:17.381
Marsha can't even be understood
in 1992 without the context of...

45:17.464 --> 45:20.217
Dead trannies were literally
washing up on the street.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.261
I mean, lying there dead, and...

45:24.471 --> 45:27.599
no interest shown whatsoever
in doing a damn thing about it.

45:28.267 --> 45:30.352
You know more about this than I do.

45:47.578 --> 45:50.998
Before the Anti-Violence
Project, this is where I worked

45:51.081 --> 45:56.920
from 1993 to 1996...

45:58.464 --> 46:02.634
until I was sexually assaulted
and physically assaulted

46:02.718 --> 46:06.597
by nurses and aides in this building.

46:11.393 --> 46:15.898
Right after this happened,
I couldn't feel the ground beneath me.

46:15.981 --> 46:21.111
And I would get up in the morning
and just walk, walk and walk and walk.

46:23.572 --> 46:26.116
It was like I was walking in a daze,
but when...

46:26.950 --> 46:28.577
I stopped there on Congress.

46:28.660 --> 46:32.289
I had a knife in my pocket
'cause I wanted to hurt them.

46:33.665 --> 46:37.628
What stopped me was
that I was thinking about my mother,

46:37.711 --> 46:41.340
and how would she feel
if I went to jail.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.888
It took me three days to get enough guts
'cause I was angry.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.682
And I finally made the call to AVP.

46:50.766 --> 46:55.187
And the person was so understanding
and knew what I was going through.

46:56.980 --> 47:01.485
I spoke with her for over two hours
of what I was feeling.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.330
The agency stood with me for a year

47:13.413 --> 47:16.792
that I kept on going into court,
back and forth,

47:16.875 --> 47:19.628
case canceled, case postponed.

47:19.711 --> 47:22.965
And I felt supported,
so I just wanted to give back.

47:23.048 --> 47:25.634
So, I volunteered
for the Anti-Violence Project.

47:27.302 --> 47:31.807
Fortunately for me, a space opened up
at administrative assistant,

47:31.890 --> 47:37.229
and from there I moved myself up
to domestic violence counselor advocate.

47:38.355 --> 47:42.693
I helped myself, my family
and the community.

47:45.654 --> 47:48.699
Was AVP involved
with the investigation then?

47:48.782 --> 47:49.992
- Of Marsha's case?
- Yeah.

47:50.075 --> 47:51.827
- Yes.
- Okay, okay. Wow, okay.

47:51.910 --> 47:54.037
- We've been around since 1980.
- Yeah.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.207
So, during that time,
we were involved in the case,

47:57.291 --> 48:00.669
and here's some of the flyers
that AVP had given out.

48:00.752 --> 48:03.839
That's Marsha.
There's her death certificate.

48:03.922 --> 48:07.301
We haven't got the toxicology report
or any pictures, or anything like that.

48:07.384 --> 48:11.555
That's what we're trying to get to see
what condition the body was in,

48:11.638 --> 48:14.141
and if it says
that she had a hole in the head.

48:14.224 --> 48:17.519
It sounds like a lot of people think
it was a murder,

48:17.603 --> 48:18.895
- or that she was pushed.
- Yeah.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.273
A lot of people think
that it was foul play.

48:21.356 --> 48:23.567
But they first said it was suicide.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.070
Some people say
she was giving things away,

48:27.154 --> 48:29.364
- and flowers and some of her clothing.
- Yeah.

48:29.448 --> 48:33.577
I says, well, sometimes a person,
when they're gonna commit suicide,

48:33.660 --> 48:35.203
- they give their things away.
- Yeah.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.539
But then, at the same time,
that's how she was all the time.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.916
- She was always giving...
- She was always giving things away.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.086
Somebody says, "I like your scarf."
"Here, darling."

48:43.170 --> 48:46.798
She'd give 'em the scarf,
or she would go around giving flowers.

48:46.882 --> 48:48.342
That's Marsha.

48:52.429 --> 48:56.391
She had too much to live for,
like she was looking forward to Gay Pride.

48:56.475 --> 48:58.185
- She showed up at Pride...
- Mmm-hmm.

48:58.268 --> 49:01.813
...and was her old regal self,
enjoyable self, and things like that.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.066
- Just normal Marsha.
- Yeah.

49:04.149 --> 49:05.442
Marsha!

49:05.525 --> 49:07.027
- Marsha!
- Marsha!

49:07.110 --> 49:09.863
But the police,
they didn't pay it any mind.

49:09.946 --> 49:13.033
Something that they were accustomed
to sweeping under the rug.

49:13.116 --> 49:14.701
Things that still go on.

49:15.327 --> 49:17.037
Nothing really has changed.

49:18.914 --> 49:23.752
No justice, no peace!

49:28.215 --> 49:29.925
So what's going on
with this case?

49:30.008 --> 49:33.011
They're gonna get motions.
They're getting set for motions.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.347
Then they're gonna
jury selection on Monday.

49:35.430 --> 49:36.515
Okay, okay.

49:36.598 --> 49:40.936
You know, he confessed already twice,
to the detective and to the witness.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.105
How much time do you think he's gonna get?

49:43.188 --> 49:44.272
Who knows?

49:45.190 --> 49:47.192
Back in the '70s,
we went through all this crap.

49:47.275 --> 49:50.696
But back then, it's just that
you didn't hear about all these killings.

49:52.072 --> 49:55.409
You didn't hear about it
because now there's more media coverage.

49:55.492 --> 49:56.576
Right. That's true, yeah.

49:57.703 --> 50:01.123
I gotta text my honey.
Sorry, I have some private business...

50:01.206 --> 50:04.793
- Oh, my God. A honey.
- I'm in love with him.

50:04.876 --> 50:06.586
- You're in love with him?
- Yes, I am.

50:06.670 --> 50:09.548
- You'll be sorry.
- Why? Why do you say that?

50:10.841 --> 50:13.135
♪ Foolish little girl
Fickle little girl ♪

50:13.218 --> 50:14.928
So, this is what I am, huh?

50:15.011 --> 50:17.848
♪ You didn't want him when he wanted you ♪

50:22.769 --> 50:28.775
♪ Love don’t need a reason ♪

50:28.859 --> 50:33.822
♪ Love don’t always rhyme ♪

50:33.905 --> 50:40.412
♪ And love is all we have for now ♪

50:40.495 --> 50:47.210
♪ What we don’t have is time ♪

50:49.129 --> 50:51.923
She tried to help
through the AIDS epidemic.

50:52.007 --> 50:55.093
If you were sick,
she'd sit right by you.

50:55.177 --> 50:58.930
She'd stop by and say, "Hey, are you okay?
Do you need something?"

50:59.848 --> 51:02.225
She was helping a person survive.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.230
I always meet these young people

51:07.314 --> 51:10.734
that don't have nobody
who wants to stick by them and help them.

51:10.817 --> 51:14.863
So I help them out with,
like, a place to stay,

51:14.946 --> 51:18.575
or some food to eat,
or a little change for their pockets.

51:18.658 --> 51:21.787
They don't call me
"Pay It No Mind" Johnson for nothing.

51:22.913 --> 51:26.291
And you can't find
another butterfly like that in life.

51:26.374 --> 51:28.919
She always changed from her cocoon.

51:29.002 --> 51:30.712
And you never knew
what she was gonna wear.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.672
You never knew what she was gonna wear.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.967
Did you see this morning's treatment?
Didn't you love that?

51:36.051 --> 51:37.469
What was this morning's treatment?

51:37.552 --> 51:39.471
With the little hairdo and everything.

51:39.554 --> 51:40.931
Did you see the fur coat I got her?

51:41.932 --> 51:44.184
There she is, Miss America.

51:44.267 --> 51:46.353
Well, tomorrow morning,
I'll give you the breakfast treatment.

51:46.436 --> 51:48.605
- I'm fixing breakfast for ya.
- Yes, yes, yes.

51:48.688 --> 51:52.150
- I'm gonna put on my Valentine outfit.
- I love it.

51:52.234 --> 51:53.902
- And you're gonna be...
- For breakfast?

51:53.985 --> 51:55.862
Yes, you're gonna be gagging.

51:57.072 --> 51:59.032
You'd be surprised
how many gorgeous clothes

51:59.115 --> 52:01.952
Randy got around here for me
that I don't even wear.

52:02.035 --> 52:04.287
Oh, the red velvet suit?

52:04.371 --> 52:07.374
Yes, and all the furs.

52:07.457 --> 52:09.584
We're gonna give you the treatment
tomorrow morning,

52:09.668 --> 52:13.004
just to get your heart ready
for heart failure.

52:28.895 --> 52:30.981
- Are you taping all this?
- Yeah.

52:31.064 --> 52:32.607
- Right now?
- Right.

52:32.691 --> 52:35.527
He's gonna try and
write an article to try and help us.

52:35.610 --> 52:37.612
I'm trying to
get some information

52:37.696 --> 52:39.531
about what's going on on West Street,

52:39.614 --> 52:42.951
with the police harassing everybody.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.746
In my whole time
of having any dealings

52:46.830 --> 52:48.540
with the Sixth Precinct Vice Squad,

52:48.623 --> 52:50.959
these little creeps slapped me...

52:51.960 --> 52:53.420
threatened to kill me,

52:53.503 --> 52:56.298
told me right in the precinct,
in front of everybody.

52:56.882 --> 53:00.093
The one with the glasses,
he says, "What are you, a girl or a boy?"

53:01.970 --> 53:04.097
Next thing I knew,
I was getting punched in my jaw.

53:06.433 --> 53:09.436
The first time,
we was all on the corner,

53:09.519 --> 53:11.605
and somebody had just said, "Run."

53:11.688 --> 53:15.817
And they just started beating on me
and kicking me in the chest.

53:15.901 --> 53:18.862
They do that
to a lot of people that run.

53:18.945 --> 53:20.447
He pulled out his gun.

53:20.530 --> 53:23.366
He said, "If you come back down here,
I'm gonna shoot you."

53:23.450 --> 53:26.161
Then the other cop said,
"I oughta throw him in the water.

53:26.244 --> 53:28.538
But he might be too skinny.
He might not hit the bottom."

53:28.622 --> 53:29.456
Yeah.

53:29.539 --> 53:32.709
They seem to believe
that it is their job and duty

53:32.792 --> 53:36.671
to extricate all transvestites,
to torture transvestites.

53:43.720 --> 53:48.308
How many trans murders
did AVP record in 1992?

53:48.391 --> 53:51.895
That summer was the worst summer ever.

53:52.520 --> 53:56.274
We had many, many marches.
We were demonstrating all the time,

53:56.358 --> 54:00.070
because that was a way
to get public and police attention.

54:00.946 --> 54:04.074
But anti-LGBT violence was at a peak.

54:04.157 --> 54:08.870
That year we had 1,300 reports
of bias crime.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.580
Some were from the police?

54:10.664 --> 54:13.917
Yeah. If you look at
the annual reports there,

54:14.626 --> 54:18.463
you're gonna see, whatever,
12, 18% of those

54:18.546 --> 54:23.176
were based on violence
perpetrated by police.

54:23.259 --> 54:25.595
Was this after or before Marsha's demise?

54:28.390 --> 54:32.394
It was going on
before what happened to Marsha...

54:33.269 --> 54:34.980
and it went on for a long time.

54:35.855 --> 54:37.399
It's that whole period.

54:37.482 --> 54:39.317
We were sick at heart

54:39.401 --> 54:43.530
about this unrelenting wave of attacks,

54:43.613 --> 54:48.118
particularly given the circumstances
surrounding Marsha's death.

55:12.225 --> 55:15.353
What was the community's
relationship with the Sixth Precinct?

55:15.437 --> 55:17.814
It was not positive because

55:17.897 --> 55:22.193
it was not an adequate response
from the police to all this violence.

55:22.277 --> 55:26.281
It wasn't an adequate response
from One Police Plaza

55:26.364 --> 55:28.742
that went all the way down
to the Sixth Precinct.

55:40.086 --> 55:42.547
They did not pay
sufficient attention

55:42.630 --> 55:45.675
to crimes like what happened to Marsha.

55:46.885 --> 55:49.387
It was obvious that she had been murdered,

55:49.471 --> 55:55.185
and it was obvious that the police weren’t
giving it the attention that it deserved.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.212
I mean, I don't have any peace
at home anymore, doll.

56:22.295 --> 56:27.425
My roommate Randy's really after
the people from the Festival Committee.

56:27.509 --> 56:31.096
- Tommy, thank you.
- You're welcome.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.556
I mean, he's doing
this whole great big trip

56:33.640 --> 56:35.809
with all these organizations

56:35.892 --> 56:38.770
to change all these people around lately.

56:41.397 --> 56:43.650
Which can get you murdered, you know.

56:45.944 --> 56:49.322
Honey, and wait until they get ahold
of you for taking their money away.

56:49.405 --> 56:51.407
Randy tried to put me in the middle of it.

56:51.491 --> 56:54.911
I tell him I don't bite my tongue
for nobody.

56:54.994 --> 56:57.247
I tell him I don’t want to be bothered.

56:57.330 --> 57:03.211
So, honey, we're wondering when the Mob
is gonna come with the bullets.

57:03.294 --> 57:04.963
I understand you.

57:05.713 --> 57:08.091
And when the Mob comes,
darling, they say,

57:08.174 --> 57:11.302
"Why are you giving out these flyers?
What do you got against us?"

57:11.386 --> 57:14.139
"Oh, I don’t have anything against youse.

57:14.222 --> 57:16.474
It's just that my roommate suspects...

57:17.642 --> 57:21.438
that youse have been
racketeering and stuff."

57:47.046 --> 57:49.007
Hi, my name is Randy Wicker.

57:49.674 --> 57:51.468
I have started the campaign

57:51.551 --> 57:55.138
to expose and replace
the Christopher Street Festival Committee.

58:01.102 --> 58:02.770
I'm tired of shady operators running

58:02.854 --> 58:05.482
the Christopher Street Festival
on Gay Pride Day.

58:05.565 --> 58:08.026
Where do all those festival dollars go?

58:10.653 --> 58:15.450
The Christopher Street Festival Committee
is widely rumored to be Mob-controlled.

58:15.533 --> 58:18.870
We're gonna take this festival back,
run it for our community.

58:18.953 --> 58:20.246
Take back the day.

58:24.042 --> 58:27.045
Remember this event here,
Take Back the Day?

58:27.128 --> 58:28.963
Where Randy was trying to take back

58:29.047 --> 58:32.258
the Christopher Street Festival
from the Mob?

58:40.266 --> 58:43.853
I remember he had signs about it.
It was a...

58:45.271 --> 58:48.900
concern with him.
I don't remember a particular day.

58:48.983 --> 58:51.361
Who was running
the Christopher Street Festival

58:51.444 --> 58:53.696
during that time that you remember?

58:55.240 --> 58:58.368
If you take charge and make
a logical decision, people will follow.

58:59.953 --> 59:04.916
Heritage of Pride would organize
the annual march, rally and dance.

59:04.999 --> 59:09.254
And we'd march downtown
along Fifth Avenue, into the Village.

59:11.464 --> 59:16.970
In the Village, there was the annual
Christopher Street Liberation Festival,

59:17.887 --> 59:21.933
which was basically booths
and meat on a stick,

59:22.016 --> 59:24.394
and your standard street festival.

59:25.853 --> 59:29.190
The guys who ran the festival
were Ed Murphy,

59:29.274 --> 59:33.069
who had been a bouncer at the Stonewall,
and his friend Red Mahoney.

59:33.152 --> 59:35.071
And Red Mahoney was his...

59:36.030 --> 59:37.532
you know, um...

59:38.992 --> 59:40.451
assistant.

59:41.035 --> 59:46.207
They worked for whatever part
of the Mafia ran the gay bars at the time.

59:46.958 --> 59:50.253
They did their thing
and we did ours, and...

59:50.336 --> 59:52.422
The reason I'm bringing this up is because

59:52.505 --> 59:55.967
Marsha would go around saying
the Mob was after her.

59:56.050 --> 01:00:00.513
- That's why I'm asking these questions.
- I can see getting that upset.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.182
But the gay bar business wasn't gonna be

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.268
where you put your folks
who could shoot well,

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:08.146
and it wasn't where you put folks
who could run the business.

01:00:08.229 --> 01:00:12.525
It was what you did with the idiot nephew
who wasn't capable of being a mobster.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:18.364
He was capable of showing up and getting
whatever percentage at the door he got,

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.825
and selling overpriced toilet paper.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:26.623
Well, Randy Wicker
hired Sam Ciccone

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.208
to do an investigation,

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:33.254
and there was some guy
named Jacques Garon.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:37.091
A couple of the accusations
being made about the Festival Committee

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:39.761
is that it's backed by some of the Mob.

01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:44.390
Two, you're making a lot of money
and profit off this thing

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.726
and nothing goes back
to the gay community.

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:49.520
The first thing
is about the Mob connection.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:52.482
That rumor has been going on
for centuries.

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:54.233
I've been in the committee
for seven years

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.277
and I've never seen any Mob connection,

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:58.488
'cause I wouldn't be involved
if that would be the case.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:01.574
Number two, as far as making
a lot of money? God, I wish.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.577
The only money that we get

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:09.332
is through the sale of the booths
on Christopher Street on Friday.

01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.167
And what happens with that money?

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.544
That money is given back in many ways.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.089
We help a lot of people
throughout the year.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:19.717
We don't make a big issue out of it
because we don't want to.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:23.262
It's outrageous that these kind of
people, Jacques Garon and Red Mahoney,

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:26.891
are running our particular event.

01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:29.811
I say that we're gonna
take this festival back.

01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:31.771
We'll run it for our community.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.898
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.

01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:37.193
This is Randy Wicker saying
keep the faith.

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:40.446
Randy was good
at antagonizing people.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.492
But why stop at knocking off Marsha?
Why not punish Randy?

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.130
- Okay.
- All right.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.424
Here we go. Here we are again.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.517
- Number seven.
- Call log, that's what you're looking for?

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.646
Yeah, call logs.
To see if there's anything we've missed.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:19.068
Maybe it's one of those two boxes there.
Shit, wouldn’t you know it.

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:20.945
What's this here?

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:23.406
- Ms. Vicky, do you need help?
- Nah.

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:25.032
Look, Ms. Vicky.

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.868
Wait a minute.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:29.954
Here it is.

01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:31.622
- Found it?
- Yeah.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.048
Okay.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:59.066
"Received a call.
Do you know Randy Wicker?

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:06.574
Tell Randy Wicker to leave Jacques Garon,
Red Mahoney and...

01:03:06.657 --> 01:03:09.577
did not get name... alone,

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:14.499
or what happened to Marsha Johnson
will happen to him."

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.543
Shit.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:32.600
It was a very chilling phone call,

01:03:32.683 --> 01:03:37.104
particularly given the circumstances
surrounding Marsha's death

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.817
and everything that was going on
with the Festival Committee.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.111
And then... I don't know
if this happened the same day.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:49.242
You received a call
from a Rodger McFarlane

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:52.411
and he said he remembered seeing Marsha

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:58.292
on the fifth at 4:00 a.m. in the morning
on 22nd Street.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.128
He said that Marsha was kind of terrified

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:05.883
and was being followed by two guys
going west to the river.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:09.428
- Was that reported to the police?
- That was reported to the police.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.890
'Cause that determines
someone saw Marsha on the fifth,

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:15.434
and her body was found on the sixth.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.313
We made that statement publicly known.

01:04:19.897 --> 01:04:22.149
It was up to the police
to follow up on it.

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:25.862
Right. Then that would tie in
about Randy taking on the Mob,

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:30.950
the call that you got
of Marsha being followed and her death.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.953
Well, those pieces certainly fit together.

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.373
There's all these pieces here

01:04:37.456 --> 01:04:42.587
that point to exactly
what we were saying back then, that...

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.381
Marsha did not die by suicide.

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:48.509
In any other community,

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:53.389
had a similar hero been found dead

01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:55.975
under unclear circumstances,

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:02.565
it seems self-evident that the city
would have put real resources behind it

01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.650
to try to figure out what happened.

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:24.712
Cold Case Squad,
Detective Litwin. Can I help you?

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:27.757
Yes, good afternoon, Detective Litwin.
It's Victoria Cruz.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.759
- Hi, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:32.303
- And yourself?
- Very good, thank you.

01:05:32.386 --> 01:05:37.683
Okay, I know that you had spoken
to a couple of retired detectives,

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:42.605
and they called me because I investigated
this case about two years ago.

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:46.442
And I'm not gonna say
she committed suicide,

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:51.280
but there's no credible evidence
that she was murdered. None.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.908
Let me ask you a question.

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:58.621
Did the police ever record
the threats made to Randy Wicker?

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.749
That's never come up at all.
I don't have any record of that.

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:05.920
So I can't really say anything on that.

01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:08.547
Did AVP ever pass that on
to the police department?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.299
They said they did.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:11.926
And what about the sighting of Marsha

01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:15.680
on the fifth at 4:00 a.m.
in the morning on 22nd Street?

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:20.559
She was kind of frightened
because there were two men following her

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.729
as she was rushing down
towards the Hudson River.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:27.942
Do you know if the police ever recorded
two males following her?

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:30.820
- I see no record of that in the case.
- You see no record?

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:35.449
No, there was never anything
conveyed to the police

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:39.120
about her being seen on the fifth
and being followed.

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:41.414
So, that's new to me.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:30.463
- So how you been?
- Pretty good.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.424
Okay, listen.

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:38.971
I have a couple of questions
to ask you because all the, um...

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.684
- All that we've been finding out...
- Right.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.770
...points to the Mob.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.481
Okay.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:50.649
What do you know about that?

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.151
So, Marsha...

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:58.949
apparently had a fear
about the Mob or the Mafia.

01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:01.494
- And I don't...
- Because?

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:06.040
Because I was investigating
the Christopher Street Festival Committee.

01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:10.336
Have you and Marsha ever had
a conversation about this subject?

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.881
Of you taking on the Christopher Street
Festival and the Mob?

01:08:13.964 --> 01:08:18.260
Maybe that's why she didn't wanna go home.
She thought she was in danger.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.890
She probably raised the issue with me
about what I was doing.

01:08:23.974 --> 01:08:25.309
I don't remember that.

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:27.895
But if she had, I would've laughed at it,

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.564
because to me
it was just a political fight.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:33.234
I don't think of political fights
as being heavy duty,

01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:36.862
where they murder your roommate
because they don't like what you're doing.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:44.078
Heritage of Pride tried to get control of
the Festival a couple years before I did,

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:45.871
and they were threatened.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.665
- By whom?
- By the Mob.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:54.046
They told me, "Randy, don't do this.
We tried to do it and we were threatened."

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.756
And I said, "Well, I'm gonna do it."

01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:02.429
Well, on July 28th,
they've made a threat to you.

01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:07.100
Here.

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:12.982
At 5:55 on the 28th,
just five minutes before AVP closes,

01:09:13.064 --> 01:09:16.234
my informant gets this call.
"Do you know Randy Wicker?"

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:18.154
Matt said, "Yes." Then he said,

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:23.033
"Tell Randy to leave Jacques Garon,
Red Mahoney,"

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:25.953
and another person who did not get named,

01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:30.541
"alone or what happened to Marsha Johnson
will happen to him."

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:32.001
And the person hung up.

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:33.669
Oh, God.

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:43.595
I am sure that he did not tell me that.
I'm willing to bet you now...

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.348
So, you were never threatened
when you took them on?

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:50.685
No. I never... Who would forget that?

01:09:53.647 --> 01:09:57.276
When people would tell me things
about the Mob and whatever,

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:58.944
I was the one that just...

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:03.699
Don't go there, you know.
I was actually...

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:06.702
I look at it now,
I realize I was really in heavy denial.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:09.413
That might've been
why she ended up staying out,

01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:12.333
and why staying out, she winded...

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:16.587
Instead of being home and safe in Hoboken,
you know, with me,

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:19.048
and the dog, you know, and our family.

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:20.799
Could I say
you're blaming yourself for it?

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:24.428
Yeah, I think that...
I mean, it really bothers me.

01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:26.555
I mean, I didn't know that.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.574
This is a beautiful turnout.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:47.743
And she's gonna be so proud.

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:52.331
And remember that the last name...
The middle name is Marsha P. Johnson,

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:56.418
and the P stands for
"Pay It No Mind" Johnson!

How long
have you lived here?

01:13:00.417 --> 01:13:07.049
I've been here since a week
before Gay Pride Day this year.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.927
This is my little house.

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:16.141
When I got that telegram
that Marsha was dead...

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:19.228
part of me went with her

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:24.108
because one of our pacts was that we would
always cross River Jordan together.

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:28.278
And to me, this is the River Jordan.
The Hudson River.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.781
And that's when I started reaching
for the bottle

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:32.783
more heavily than I was doing.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.293
After Marsha's death...

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:48.632
I came back to New York City.

01:14:07.484 --> 01:14:09.194
We are your history!

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:16.660
She's not here, but she's here in spirit,
Marsha P. Johnson.

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:19.413
- She's always...
- Yeah. She'll always be with me.

01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:20.622
Always.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:23.208
She'll always be
in the front of this parade.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.017
Let's put Marsh there.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.895
Can't forget Marsh.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:00.037
Records, Ms. Henry.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.581
Hi, good afternoon, Ms. Henry.
My name is Victoria.

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:06.126
I sent an inquiry
in reference to getting, um,

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:09.546
the medical examiner's records
from a case back in '92,

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.507
and I was just wondering
if you've received it.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:14.927
Okay, Victoria, I'm getting ready
to send you a letter

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:19.765
to say that, as of now,
our office can't locate this case file.

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:24.019
- You can't locate the case file?
- That's right.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.564
Any particular reason
that it's not locatable?

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:32.152
I don't know. It's not in archives
and it's not in the container.

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:34.613
That's kind of strange.

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:37.199
These things do happen
every now and again.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:42.788
Did some other department check that out
or your department did?

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:47.084
It's my department only
that has custody of those case files.

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:48.919
And...

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:53.882
And then in all your 1992 cases,
the only file that's missing is that one?

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:56.176
I wouldn't say that.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.471
I've never said that,
and I will never say that.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:03.016
- You searched personally?
- Yes. Correct.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:08.772
And who can I speak to more or less
to get something really done on this case?

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.984
I don't know who to tell you.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:20.534
We're here today
to support justice for Islan Nettles.

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:23.203
Today will be the start
to the trial at 9:30.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:27.499
We're hoping that the outcome
of the trial, whenever trial ends,

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.835
is gonna be the maximum sentence
for James Dixon,

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:32.796
the person accused
of killing Islan Nettles.

01:16:32.879 --> 01:16:34.631
That maximum sentence is 25 years,

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.467
and that's what we're asking the DA
to ask the judge for.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.225
You've been following
Marsha's case.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:49.271
So what has, like, this case...
Has it helped to bring some light

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:52.524
to past cases of violence
against transgender people?

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:53.609
No. On the contrary.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:56.570
Just as most cases that come up
against trans women,

01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.363
they plead the panic defense,

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.491
or they just think
they can brush it under the rug,

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:03.493
and people will pay no mind to it.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:07.456
Can you actually speak a little bit more
to this panic defense?

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:10.792
The panic defense? Well, they didn't know
she was a trans woman.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:15.631
There was a case back in '97,
Fitzgerald case.

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:19.426
Picked up this person in a gay bar,
male gay bar,

01:17:19.509 --> 01:17:21.136
and took them home.

01:17:21.219 --> 01:17:24.139
In court, he didn't know
she was a trans woman.

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:27.768
The person was stabbed multiple times,
and he got off.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.356
Pleaded panic defense.
Just like now, in the Nettles case.

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:35.233
He claimed he panicked.
That's his defense.

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.079
The West Side Highway
is due for a fix-up.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.580
It's been a long time coming.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.916
There are concerns
about uprooting some people there.

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:53.460
The homeless will be asked to move
tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

01:17:53.543 --> 01:17:55.921
The plans call for
the Hudson River Boulevard,

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:59.966
trees, traffic for seven lanes
and paths for bikers, joggers and skaters.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.553
The homeless will have to pack up
their few possessions and get out.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:05.681
There's a sense of anger
and desperation here

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:09.351
for about 30 homeless people
who call Pier 54 their home.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:13.522
What about going to a shelter, or getting
some of the services that are available?

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:15.273
Is that not an option for you?

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:18.443
The city shelters are not safe.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:21.655
- Do you feel like it's safer here?
- Yes.

01:18:22.989 --> 01:18:27.327
It's called a sweep.
Not even a fucking eviction.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.872
A sweep. Like we're trash.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:58.275
There's so many fucking buildings
in this fucking Manhattan,

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:02.821
and they can't give up
a fucking building to fucking...

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:09.453
maybe 15 people that will go in
and try to re-renovate it?

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:13.540
Marsha and I did it back in the '70s
on our own.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:19.921
Yeah, I'm crazy,
because the world has made me crazy.

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.509
Don't be going in my house!

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:27.345
Excuse me, don't be going in my house!

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:26.696
Well, Marsha, we tried.
That's all I can say.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:20.208
- Hi, Ms. Henry.
- A package was mailed out to you.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.919
Okay, so you mailed us
the autopsy report.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:27.132
I mailed you
whatever I was able to put together, okay?

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:29.676
So, we'll be receiving it
in the near future?

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:31.761
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:34.681
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.730
- Hi, Eddie. Come on in.
- Hi.

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.984
- Did you bring the report?
- Yeah.

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:50.572
Okay, Ms. Henry said it was only partial.
Is it a big envelope?

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:51.907
It's kind of heavy.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.826
This looks flimsy.

01:21:56.953 --> 01:21:59.748
"Office of the Medical Examiner,
City of New York,

01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:04.210
have performed an autopsy
on the body of Malcolm Michaels

01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:09.633
on the 7th day of July, 1992,
at 1:30 p.m."

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.510
But they classified it
as drowning at first,

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:17.140
but then they circled "possible homicide."
Like, here.

01:22:18.725 --> 01:22:21.978
It looks like they found
a lot of discoloration,

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:25.315
but no evidence of trauma.

01:22:25.398 --> 01:22:27.275
- Does that sound right?
- No trauma on the skull. Yeah.

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:31.279
"There is a sub... Uh..."

01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:34.282
I don't know what the fuck this word is.

01:22:35.825 --> 01:22:38.286
Maybe we should look at
another examiner's look at them.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:43.291
- Or get... Right, get somebody...
- Have a professional look at this autopsy.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.461
- Dr. Kildare.
- Doctor... Who's that?

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:48.213
He was before your time.

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:53.969
"Images of photos on CD."

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.690
Okay.

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.989
Oh, God.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.283
Oh.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:32.173
What we have here
is an unwitnessed drowning.

01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:37.387
She went into the water
while still alive and breathing.

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:40.890
It wasn't a situation where
death occurred someplace else,

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:44.269
by whatever means...

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:47.772
and then put in the water.

01:23:49.065 --> 01:23:51.526
Whether she's pushed in,

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:54.863
whether she's being chased
and falls accidentally,

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:59.284
we can't tell from the autopsy.
That depends on the police investigation.

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.745
Could you rule out a violent assault?

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.372
Yes, there's no evidence there
of violent assault.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:09.711
There was no injury, no impact injury,
to any part of her body.

01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:15.258
There was no fracture of the skull,
there was no damage to the brain at all.

01:24:15.967 --> 01:24:17.343
What about
the hole in the head?

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:22.015
Well, the body gets injured after death...

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:25.351
- Okay.
- ...by floating debris and all that.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:29.731
And the body starts breaking apart faster
in warmer water.

01:24:29.814 --> 01:24:32.525
So what looks like
a gash on the left side,

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:34.944
- is really just the peeling of skin.
- Okay.

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:38.073
But it's just normal separation of skin.

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:44.204
I don't think it was a suicide.

01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:46.748
It could've been an accident.
It could've...

01:24:46.831 --> 01:24:48.875
They said the pier was dilapidated.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:51.503
He could've stepped through
a hole in the pier.

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:54.380
Or people could have been following him,

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:59.010
and because there was no evidence
of any type of trauma to the body,

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.096
that don't mean they beat him up
and threw him in the water.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:04.974
They could've chased him, scared him,
and he also fell through the pier.

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:08.061
Yes, that certainly
brings up the issue of homicide,

01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:10.230
because if somebody's being chased...

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:13.191
and runs in front of a car,

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:18.196
or accidentally falls into the water,
runs into the water,

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.448
that would be called a homicide.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:24.953
Well, we have documentation
where she was frantic, being followed.

01:25:25.036 --> 01:25:29.207
Credible person giving this report
to our agency,

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.668
and then wasn't even investigated.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.882
Well, there's no, um...

01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:44.222
statute of limitation on homicide,
and that goes beyond my pay grade.

01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:57.110
Something's wrong.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:02.323
We keep on running into a brick wall
whenever we deal with the city.

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:05.785
Every time I spoke to a cop,
and they just brushed me off.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:06.995
Something's wrong.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:10.790
Every time I made a call,
"You have to do this and this and this."

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:12.000
Something's wrong.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.336
Why this particular case?

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:20.008
I think maybe we should go up
one step higher,

01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:24.137
and maybe seek some assistance
from someplace outside of New York City

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.223
to just look over what we have here.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.104
You know, it's obvious that
the police are not cooperating with this.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:36.774
Well, we don't have an endless pot

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:40.737
of people or time or resources.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:44.782
And so, I'm not really sure
what is involved in that.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:51.206
You know, just today, you all were
at the trial for Islan Nettles.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:54.000
I mean, there are so many cases,

01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:58.796
and so many have not had any resolution.

01:26:59.505 --> 01:27:05.386
We've had, in the last couple of months,
a number of murders across the country.

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:08.014
When trans lives are under attack,
what do we do?

01:27:08.097 --> 01:27:09.474
Stand up, fight back.

01:27:10.099 --> 01:27:12.060
Eight transgender women
across the country

01:27:12.143 --> 01:27:13.853
have been murdered in the last 34 days.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:16.940
There have been more than
400 people murdered in the past decade.

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:19.692
Transgender women
face the most severe violence

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.903
within the LGBTQ community.

01:27:21.986 --> 01:27:24.948
A transgender woman was found
strangled to death.

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:27.408
Police say she was stabbed several times.

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:30.745
In street lingo, it was a
curb stomp. He was dressed as a woman.

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:32.247
And shame on the media

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.457
for calling us men dressed
in women's clothing.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.793
Shame on the media for that.

01:27:36.876 --> 01:27:40.296
This cannot go unanswered.
I say, hands off my sister.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:44.801
Do we not deal
with the immediate needs there

01:27:44.884 --> 01:27:49.806
to go back and spend the time
to investigate this case?

01:27:49.889 --> 01:27:52.850
Or even, like, what does that mean?

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.687
What does that mean?
Justice for Marsha.

01:27:55.770 --> 01:28:02.151
Keep your hands off my sister!

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:04.362
And justice for so many others.

01:28:05.029 --> 01:28:10.326
The visibility that we can do something
about a case that's been cold,

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:11.786
and then seeking justice,

01:28:11.869 --> 01:28:14.706
if not for the family,
but for the community.

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:16.582
- I know...
- Because this is part of our history.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:19.377
It is part of our history.
I completely believe that.

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.462
And I'm also worried about the future.

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.047
Keep your hands off my sister!

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:32.265
Keep your hands off my sister!
Keep your hands off my sister!

01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:05.108
Whatever happened,
it must have been around here.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:42.228
We live as who we are.
This is us. This is us being at home.

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:46.357
I don't know,
we just want to be ourselves.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.026
The women we are, inside-out.

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.446
Right? Am I wrong?

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.283
She's right. Very wise of her.

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:58.369
It started out,
it was just Chelsea and me.

01:30:58.452 --> 01:31:03.374
And, um, then,
people just started to come.

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:06.502
We started to think of ourselves as,

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:09.964
you know, this was the house
that Sylvia and Marsha had.

01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:14.260
And we really looked at STAR House
as our reference point.

01:31:17.555 --> 01:31:20.850
Aw, there they are.
I have to get this picture.

01:31:23.019 --> 01:31:27.148
She'd been homeless, and she'd been living
on a pier, and that sort of thing.

01:31:27.231 --> 01:31:31.652
And I said, "Hey, you're not homeless.
I got a place.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:34.030
Long as I got a place,
you're not homeless."

01:31:34.113 --> 01:31:36.824
She didn't move in right away,
but she started coming around.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:40.328
She'd do some work in the backyard,
do some work around the house

01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:41.996
in lieu of paying rent.

01:31:42.079 --> 01:31:44.582
...went around the streets.

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:50.004
We have to help one another.
We really do. It's important.

01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:52.048
The people in the house
really related to Sylvia.

01:31:52.131 --> 01:31:54.634
She mothered them, in a way,
and gave advice.

01:31:54.717 --> 01:31:56.302
She talked with them.

01:31:56.385 --> 01:32:00.348
But when she sobered up,
then she was much better with them.

01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:03.643
Just like cold turkey.
Bang, no more drinking.

01:32:05.436 --> 01:32:08.856
We have to remember,
we must continue to fight this government

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.358
because this government is the one

01:32:10.441 --> 01:32:13.945
that's going to keep us divided
at all time.

01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:19.283
That's when she got back
into her role, I think,

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.911
as an activist in the community.

01:32:21.994 --> 01:32:24.956
And all of a sudden, we noticed
people were coming up and saying,

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:28.668
"You're Sylvia Rivera, aren't you?
I thought you was dead!"

01:32:30.127 --> 01:32:31.504
I began to realize that

01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:35.591
she really had a lot of projection
in the community.

01:32:39.845 --> 01:32:41.097
It's a huge party,

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.057
and its mission
is to fight against discrimination.

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.101
In the streets of Rome,

01:32:45.184 --> 01:32:49.438
World Gay Pride gathered 200,000 gays,
transgender people and lesbians

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:53.109
from Italy, as well as America,
France and Germany.

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:10.001
It really gives me great
pleasure to be here in representation

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:15.089
of the gay liberation movement
and the transgender movement

01:33:15.172 --> 01:33:18.259
all the way from the United States.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:27.310
I didn't think 31 years ago
that I would have so many children,

01:33:27.393 --> 01:33:30.104
but I'm proud to have liberated you.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:34.984
Viva and love Pride,

01:33:35.067 --> 01:33:39.238
and continue your struggle
all around the world!

01:33:47.496 --> 01:33:49.540
The crowd went crazy.

01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:51.709
At one point in between my speech,

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:55.629
they started calling me
a living myth in Italian.

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.465
Mistica. Mistica.

01:33:59.925 --> 01:34:02.928
Oh, my God, it's hard.

01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:05.097
Then people were coming up
and kissing my hand,

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:08.142
and then giving me the double kiss,

01:34:08.225 --> 01:34:10.019
and going through the whole scenario

01:34:10.102 --> 01:34:12.688
with the little bit of English
that they knew.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:16.442
"Thank you for what you did at Stonewall."

01:34:16.525 --> 01:34:19.528
I was really emotional
about the whole thing.

01:34:19.612 --> 01:34:21.781
- Guess what?
- What?

01:34:21.864 --> 01:34:25.659
Guess where Mother has keys to now, then?

01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:27.536
To the church.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.580
- To the church?
- Mother got a job at church.

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:31.374
What are you doing?

01:34:31.457 --> 01:34:33.918
- Bagging up food and whatnot.
- And are they paying you?

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:35.628
- Yes.
- No kidding.

01:34:36.962 --> 01:34:42.551
I can go home and say that
I've actually tried to make a difference.

01:34:43.427 --> 01:34:45.054
That's what marriage does to you.

01:34:45.137 --> 01:34:47.932
- She's made me an honest woman.
- Really? That's good.

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:52.812
I mean, me of all people, Sylvia Rivera,
had the keys to a church.

01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:10.746
Sylvia Rivera was 50 years old

01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:13.207
when she died of liver cancer last week.

01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:17.503
Virtually up until the moment she died,
she was lobbying for legislation

01:35:17.586 --> 01:35:21.632
to protect the rights
of this most despised of minorities.

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:25.886
Trans rights now!
Trans rights now!

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:29.682
Doubtless, there will be many stories
told about Sylvia.

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:33.477
Some true, some pure myth.

01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:37.690
That happens with great leaders.

01:35:37.773 --> 01:35:39.984
And make no mistake tonight,

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:44.655
Sylvia Rivera is the mother
of our movement,

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.782
a great leader of our people.

01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:17.188
I'm tired of people
assaulting and murdering trans women.

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:21.817
I want it changed, and it's gonna change.

01:36:22.568 --> 01:36:24.987
'Cause we're gonna keep pushing the issue
until it does.

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:28.741
Nobody's prosecuting
these people properly.

01:36:28.824 --> 01:36:32.369
They don't get
what any other murderer would get.

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:35.331
They get a pat on the wrist
and a little bit of time and let go.

01:36:35.414 --> 01:36:37.958
This judge and DA have to do
the right thing.

01:36:38.042 --> 01:36:40.753
Prosecute him
like you would a regular person.

01:36:44.715 --> 01:36:47.259
As everyone is aware,
we're here today for sentencing.

01:36:47.343 --> 01:36:50.721
First, the People are gonna be reading,
I understand, a statement.

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:54.225
I'm going to be reading
a statement that was sent to me

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:58.395
by the biological father of Islan Nettles.

01:36:59.271 --> 01:37:03.192
He had asked me personally
to read this on his behalf.

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:10.032
"There was a very outgoing,
free-spirited, young, promising individual

01:37:10.115 --> 01:37:12.034
that had a very bright future,

01:37:12.117 --> 01:37:14.453
that had the potential
to make a mark in the world.

01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:16.497
And it came to a screeching halt

01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:20.793
by an individual that was upset
because he was clowned by his friends,

01:37:20.876 --> 01:37:24.213
because he didn't know
the women he was trying to holler at

01:37:24.296 --> 01:37:26.799
was actually a transgender woman.

01:37:26.882 --> 01:37:30.386
He made a conscious decision
to beat a transgender woman to death

01:37:30.469 --> 01:37:31.804
because of who she was

01:37:31.887 --> 01:37:34.807
and the embarrassment
he felt he had suffered.

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:38.936
I was extremely proud
of the person she became.

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:41.355
But no matter
what amount of time this man gets,

01:37:41.438 --> 01:37:43.649
it will never fill the hole in my heart

01:37:43.732 --> 01:37:46.193
that a person that had
such a magnificent future

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:50.823
and was my only child
and a lifelong gift had once filled."

01:37:51.824 --> 01:37:53.617
Mr. Dixon, I hereby sentence you

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.369
to a determinate sentence of imprisonment

01:37:55.452 --> 01:37:57.121
with a term of 12 years.

01:37:58.163 --> 01:37:59.373
All right, we're adjourned.

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:04.253
You're crushing us.
You're killing us.

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:10.384
This young man is only going to end up
doing ten and a half years,

01:38:10.467 --> 01:38:13.345
learn nothing,
come back out and do this again.

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:15.139
This needs to stop.

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:17.641
We're not letting none of this go anymore.

01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:17.326
Really,
everybody goes sooner or later.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.953
Tomorrow's not promised to anyone.

01:39:20.079 --> 01:39:22.623
I learned that in church
when I was five years old.

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.459
And I've never forgotten it.

01:39:25.542 --> 01:39:29.254
So, uh, every day counts.

01:39:49.191 --> 01:39:50.609
Come on, girl.

01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:53.112
Chin up.
