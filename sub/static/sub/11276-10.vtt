00:07.100 --> 00:08.600
Oh, hi, Dr. Sternin.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.400
Dr. Crane isn't here.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.400
I know. He's at home,      
    and that's why I'm not.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.900
CARLA:  
                        Whoa-ho!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.800
Trouble in Casa de Wacko?

00:17.800 --> 00:18.900
Not really.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.500
Scotch, Woody.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.700
I'm just not looking            
forward to going home.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.200
Frasier's giving me

00:24.200 --> 00:26.500
every indication        
    that he expects me

00:26.500 --> 00:30.700
to indulge in another one of his
silly little fantasies tonight,

00:30.800 --> 00:32.900
but it's really rather personal.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.000
I know just                     
what you mean.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.500
Husbands can drive you nuts     
about stuff like that.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.000
Take my Eddie.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
He borrowed this                
fairy princess costume

00:44.000 --> 00:45.600
from the ice show.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.100
Really.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.400
Every Friday night,             
I have to dress up

00:50.400 --> 00:52.900
and put a magic                 
sex spell on him.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.100
Well, as long       
            as we're sharing,

00:57.100 --> 01:00.300
here's what I have  
            waiting for me.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.500
Every so often, 
                Frasier likes

01:02.500 --> 01:04.599
to regress          
            to his childhood.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.400
First, he insists   
            on calling me Mommy.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.900
I fix him cinnamon toast
        and strawberry milk.

01:10.900 --> 01:14.100
Then it's bath time--   
        one of my favorites--

01:14.200 --> 01:16.800
followed by my      
            tucking him into bed

01:16.800 --> 01:20.100
and singing "All the    
        Pretty Little Horses."

01:20.100 --> 01:23.800
After that,         
            we make love until  
            the windows rattle.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.500
Men! They're really             
something, aren't they?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.600
Oh, by the way, about all       
that fairy princess stuff?

01:32.700 --> 01:34.500
I was just kidding.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.700
So was I.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.600
Oh, right, Mommy.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.900
Hey, guys, get  
                a load of this!

I know. And, if she calls,      
         I'm not here.

You're just the man

            Not again.

Not bad, Sammy.     
Yeah?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
Yeah. I mean,          
it's a little thick, but, uh...

Would you guys stop 
            horsing around here?

I'm serious. I want 
            this guy Gary,      
            and I want him bad.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.400
I am tired      
                of having him

03:39.400 --> 03:41.200
do everything       
            better than we do.

this afternoon.

Listen, you guys
                are not taking  
                me seriously.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.200
I mean it. I want   
            to hurt this guy    
            where he lives.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.000
Speaking of that,               
have you seen his house?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.900
He's renovating this            
beautiful old Victorian.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.200
It's on the cover   
            of <i>Boston</i> magazine. 
I saw that.

I hear he's coming out     
 with a new T-shirt of it, too.

You guys are    
                not helping me.

04:18.700 --> 04:19.899
Well, what took you so long?

04:19.899 --> 04:21.600
I just spent the last two hours

04:21.600 --> 04:23.900
wandering through the streets  
         of Chinatown,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.900
thanks to your          
        brilliant directions.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.400
What? What?

        with a dead duck        
        hanging in the window."

04:30.700 --> 04:32.900
I defy you to find  
            a shop in Chinatown

04:32.900 --> 04:34.900
without a dead duck 
            in the window.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.400
Anyway...

04:37.500 --> 04:38.900
I got it.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
You are looking     
            at the last ounce

04:41.100 --> 04:43.800

04:46.800 --> 04:47.800
Sammy, you really               
think that stuff

04:47.800 --> 04:49.000
is going help us                
win the contest?

04:49.000 --> 04:49.800
Are you kidding me?

         what this does

        like a blowfish.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.900
Well, what... what          
are we supposed to do now?

05:18.900 --> 05:21.800
Usually, I pack             
    my face in ice.

Sam, guess what         
    I've got under my coat.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.800
If I guess right,   
            can I keep them?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.800
No, you idiot.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.600
I've got some of Gary's     
  top secret Bloody Mary mix.

Hey, way to go, 
                Rebecca!

Baby, how did you get it?

How do you                      
think I got it?

05:42.600 --> 05:43.800
You did that dorky twirl,

05:43.800 --> 05:46.100
and, when he laughed,   
        you grabbed it and ran.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.700
Okay, fine. Forget it.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.700
I'm not going to tell you.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.400
Oh, come on.          
We won't make fun of you.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.400
All right.              
     That thing Carla said.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.800
Well, I'm the one               
that got it.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.300
Well, that's good.  
            That's good.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.500
Now I'm going to take it down

06:00.600 --> 06:02.200
to the company         
    pharmaceutical division

06:02.200 --> 06:03.200
and have it analyzed

06:03.200 --> 06:04.700
to find out           
Gary's secret ingredient.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.700
CLIFF:                          
No, no. No need                 
to do that, Rebecca.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.000
Sammy, pour me a shot      
      of that concoction.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.400
I'll tell you          
     exactly what's in it.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.300
Oh, man, I don't know.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.000
No, no, no. I've got very   
    sensitive taste buds.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.600
As a matter of fact,
            in medieval times,

06:13.600 --> 06:15.900
Clavins were                    
the royal tasters.

06:15.900 --> 06:19.100
I heard they                    
were royal something.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
Well, I don't know              
what's in it,

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
but Gary makes the              
best Bloody Mary                
I've ever tasted.

            a shot of that, huh?

06:29.100 --> 06:30.100
Let me have                     
some of that.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.600
Hey, hey, you guys,             
don't drink it all.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.900
I have to take                  
some to the lab.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.600
This is great.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.800
Gary deserves to win            
this contest every year.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.300
It's almost worth cramming      
    myself into this dress.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.700
Hey, I'd dress up   
            as a hooker

06:52.700 --> 06:54.200
It can't be that special.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.600
I suppose you're going     
        to tell me

06:55.600 --> 06:57.700
that Cheers has never made      
    a Bloody Mary this good.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.200
Sammy, Cheers never             
made anything this good.

 there's black cardamom in it.

If it isn't Gary from       
    Gary's Olde Towne Tavern.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.600
Look, pal,                      
didn't I tell you

07:26.600 --> 07:28.200
if you step one                 
more foot in here

07:28.300 --> 07:29.600
you'd have me                   
to answer to?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.800
Yeah, and I told you      
      if you got in my way

07:31.900 --> 07:34.000
you'd wind up          
     in the next zip code.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.500
Then we have had                
this discussion, huh?

07:38.000 --> 07:41.800
Now, I brought a little present 
    to my friends at Cheers.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.200
Oh, yeah?                       
What's that, Gary?

07:43.300 --> 07:45.000
Towels for you to cry into

07:45.100 --> 07:47.600
after I win           
    the Bloody Mary contest.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.700
You know what I'd like     
     to do with that towel?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.400
I'd like to shove   
            that up your nose,

07:51.500 --> 07:53.200
pull it out your mouth  
        a couple times,

07:53.300 --> 07:54.900
and buff up your
                sinuses for you.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.500
Oh, as if you could.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.800
Oh, I could.

07:57.800 --> 07:58.400
You could not.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.300
Could too.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.000
Could not.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.700
Could too.

08:00.700 --> 08:01.700
Could not!

08:01.700 --> 08:03.000
Could too!

08:03.100 --> 08:04.400
Way to go,  
                    Sammy!

08:04.400 --> 08:08.300
See me slip that                
"could too" in there?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
Well, you won that one, Malone.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.300
But that's

08:11.400 --> 08:12.700
the last thing         
      you're going to win.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.300
Hey, big shot,         
      we won this contest

08:14.300 --> 08:15.800
the first two years they had it.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.500
Well, since I opened,      
    I've won the last four.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.400
All that proves is  
            that you've won it

08:20.400 --> 08:22.300
twice as much   
                as we have.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.400
How did you     
                like that, Sam?

08:24.500 --> 08:25.900
Let me handle this, Woody.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.900
Just get going.         
  Get out of here, would you?

08:27.900 --> 08:29.400
Is this                         
the thanks I get

08:29.400 --> 08:31.200
for my                          
heartfelt gift?

08:31.300 --> 08:32.700
No.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.299
This is.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.000
Oh, that's nice.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.500
I see you're still hiring       
the cool Grace Kelly type

08:40.500 --> 08:41.799
for waitresses.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.600
Choke on it!

08:43.600 --> 08:47.600
Okay, okay, I'm going back      
to the Olde Towne Tavern,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.300
where

08:49.300 --> 08:51.100
my exclusive satellite coverage

08:51.100 --> 08:53.100
of the World Welterweight       
          title fight

08:53.200 --> 08:54.600
is about to get underway.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.800
Hey.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.000
Hey, wait. Hey, come on.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.400
Where the hell         
do you think you're going?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.800
Uh... just taking   
            a little stroll.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.800
Ah! That was refreshing,
        wasn't it?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.700
Hey, Doc.       
                What's going on?

09:20.700 --> 09:23.400
Well, for one thing, I find   
    myself baching it again.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.300
Lilith finally      
            blow her brains out?

09:25.300 --> 09:29.300
No. But thank you               
for asking after her, Carla.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.500
So where is                     
the lovely Dr. Sternin?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.300
Well, she's in Albany           
for a few days

09:34.400 --> 09:36.700
attending a conference          
on gender stereotyping.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.600
Gender stereotyping?

09:38.700 --> 09:41.600
Yes. It's unfairly attributing  
certain modes of behavior

09:41.700 --> 09:43.100
exclusively to one sex.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.200
That sounds     
                kind of boring.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.300
Why did she 
                    go to that?

09:45.400 --> 09:46.600
Who knows?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.100
You know women.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.100
I can't tell you    
            how honored we are

09:52.200 --> 09:53.500
that you've     
                chosen our bar

09:53.500 --> 09:55.600
as the site of the  
            Bloody Mary contest.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.300
Well, we were                   
going to hold it

09:57.400 --> 09:58.900
at Gary's                       
Olde Towne Tavern,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.400
but they're just so             
darn crowded in there.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.700
Well, you know,

10:02.700 --> 10:04.700
you'll never have   
            that problem here.

10:06.300 --> 10:07.800
Well, I better be going.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.100
I have to drop off              
a set of rules                  
at Gary's Tavern.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.700
So long.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.700
Bye.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.400
What the hey?          
     That's Gary on the TV.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.900
GARY:              
We hid a secret camera in       
 a competitor's establishment.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.700
Let's hear what they have to say
about Gary's Bloody Marys.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.600
Boy, I don't know           
        what's in that,

10:26.600 --> 10:29.700
but Gary makes the best     
 Bloody Mary I've ever tasted.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.300
GARY:              
            Really?

10:31.300 --> 10:33.200
Gary deserves to win            
this contest every year.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.400
Thank you very much.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.800
And you'd be surprised

10:35.800 --> 10:37.300
what some people would do

10:37.300 --> 10:39.400
to get a hold          
     of my Bloody Mary mix.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.900
Hey, I'd dress up   
            like a hooker to get
            some of this stuff.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.500
GARY:              
        But you can get         
a pretty good Bloody Mary

10:44.600 --> 10:46.900
just about anywhere in town.  
    Isn't that right?

10:46.900 --> 10:49.600
Cheers never made           
    a Bloody Mary this good.

10:49.600 --> 10:53.200
If you say so,         
     Sam Malone of Cheers.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
Anybody know                    
the way to Gary's?

10:56.400 --> 10:57.800
I'll give you a lift.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.400
I can't believe         
     that weasel filmed us!

11:01.500 --> 11:03.900
Oh, that stunt tears it.    
          Now I'm mad.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.300
Yeah, I can tell.   
    How?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.700
That little vein                
bulging in my forehead?

11:07.800 --> 11:08.700
No.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.300
My nostrils flaring?

11:10.300 --> 11:11.300
No.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.400
My jaw is clenched?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.800
No.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.100
Well, then,                     
how can you tell?

11:15.200 --> 11:17.000
You just said,  
                "Now I'm mad."

11:18.800 --> 11:20.400
Yeah, well, now I'm really mad.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.300
Yeah, I can tell.   
    How?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.400
I'll tell you something.    
This is war. This is total war.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.800
No prisoners, no truce,     
    no amnesty, no nothing.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.400
Only one of us is going     
 to walk out of there standing.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.800
Well, what are you              
going to do, Sam?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.000
Well, for one,         
     to really mess him up,

11:34.100 --> 11:35.500
we're going to have       
     to infiltrate his bar.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.400
CARLA:  
                        Yeah.   
Oh, let me do it, Sam.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.900
Please. Let me do it.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.800
You know, I've taken            
a lot of makeup classes.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.200
I can... I can                  
put on a disguise

11:42.200 --> 11:44.300
and get in there without        
anyone knowing about it.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.700
Woody, I don't think so.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.100
Oh, come on.                    
Let me do it.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.700
I feel responsible.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.200
I'm the one who                 
blew away the spice.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.800
I'm the one                     
who broke the jar.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.600
I'm the one who broke           
the door in the men's room.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.600
What?

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
At the bus station              
downtown.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.500
Come on. Let me                 
make it up to you.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.700
Woody, you just...          
    you don't know

11:59.700 --> 12:00.900
what you're getting         
    yourself into.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.100
I mean, those guys      
        at Gary's are vicious.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.500
They could      
                strip you naked,

12:04.600 --> 12:06.600
paint you red and   
            put you on a subway.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.700
They wouldn't do that.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.000
They did it to me.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.000
But I got       
                the best of 'em.

12:12.100 --> 12:12.700
How's that?

12:12.700 --> 12:15.300
I loved it.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.000
Wait a minute, Woody,      
     come here, come here.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.500
Woody, Woody, Woody,

12:19.500 --> 12:21.000
I've got a plan.        
        Listen up.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.200
Shh!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.500
Gary had a camera in here       
         the other day.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.000
He could have a spy
             in here now.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.600
And the whole place
             could be bugged.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.700
Come on, you guys.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.300
Whoa, whoa.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.200
Don't take off in a clump       
        like that.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.200
It'll look suspicious.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.300
Everybody split up.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.500
We'll hook up outside.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.800
No, no, no!

12:58.900 --> 12:59.900
You're clumping up again.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.500
Spread out.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.900
No, you're clumping up again.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
Cliffie, you got
                the time, pal?

13:21.100 --> 13:23.100
Right, time check.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.500
2200 Zulu.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.400
Agent Hoosier is overdue.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.200
Abort Operation Red Dawn.

13:29.300 --> 13:30.700
Cliff...

13:30.700 --> 13:34.500
What in God's name    
          are you talking about?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.000
Spy lingo, Norm.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.300
Woody's not back
                from Gary's yet.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.600
It's time to mobilize   
        our forces. Let's go.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.900
I'm just the man for it.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.400
Actually, I considered a career 
as a spy when I was young,

13:45.500 --> 13:48.100
but in the end, I decided       
  not to go into intelligence.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.600
That seems only fair.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.200
None of it went into you.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.700
Hey, guys, guys, guys.     
What's the big rush here?

13:54.700 --> 13:55.700
Give him a chance.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.300
He's only about         
    five minutes late.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.600
Actually, I think we might be  
     underestimating Woody.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.900
You know, something tells me

14:00.900 --> 14:02.700
he might actually           
      pull this thing off.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.200
Hey! Hey!

14:07.800 --> 14:08.900
Wait, there's a note.

14:08.900 --> 14:09.900
What's it say?

14:09.900 --> 14:10.900
( <i>moaning</i> )

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
"Compliments of Gary's.         
We deliver."

14:13.000 --> 14:14.900
( <i>muffled speaking</i> )

14:15.000 --> 14:15.900
What?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.800
What are you  
                  trying to say?

14:17.800 --> 14:19.000
He's trying to say              
something.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.900
What are you...?
    Don't rip off the tape!

14:21.900 --> 14:23.700
( <i>screams</i> ):                    
Ahh!

14:31.500 --> 14:33.900
That's it, Cornmeal.            
You blew it.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.100
I'm telling you,            
    I was doing fine.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.100
I borrowed this great costume   
from my theater group.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.000
I really looked                 
like a nun.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.600
I went in there...

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.400
You dressed up as a nun
         and went into a bar?

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
Well,                           
it was either that

14:47.500 --> 14:49.300
or one of                       
the von Trapp children.

14:51.900 --> 14:55.700
This is the stupidest thing
     I have ever heard of.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.800
Hey, I don't see                
anybody else volunteering

14:58.800 --> 15:00.700
to go over there                
and get roughed up

15:00.700 --> 15:01.600
and hung by their heels.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.000
I did it 'cause                 
I was trying to help.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.600
Okay, you were trying to help.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.600
Why'd you have to be      
      so stupid about it?

15:06.600 --> 15:07.500
And that's another thing.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.400
I'm sick and tired              
of hearing that word.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.800
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.200
If I hear that word             
one more time,

15:12.300 --> 15:14.200
I'm walking out of here         
and never coming back.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.500
Oh, come on, man.   
            That's stupid.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.500
That's it, I quit.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.700
Cool down.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.600
No, no, I'm serious.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.000
I've had it with this place.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.700
I'm not appreciated here    
            anymore.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.000
Oh, Woody, come on, man.
        That's not true.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.700
Leave me alone!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.900
( <i>chuckling</i> )

15:37.000 --> 15:38.500
Well, look who's back.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.300
Sister Mary Woody.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.800
( <i>laughing</i> )

15:42.800 --> 15:44.300
I'm looking for a job.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.900
Oh, right.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.400
I heard you quit Cheers.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.800
I'm never going back      
    into Cheers again.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.800
Well, except to get       
     my last check and, uh,

15:53.800 --> 15:56.000
the only key to my apartment.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.900
So where'd you stay last night?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.800
Well, I just walked around.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.600
Down to the Commons,

16:01.600 --> 16:03.100
over to the river,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.200
across the river
                to Cambridge,

16:05.300 --> 16:06.700
back over the river,

16:06.800 --> 16:09.600
took a right at the 
            Prudential building,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.700
stopped at a newsstand,

16:11.700 --> 16:13.700
thought about buying a paper,  
        didn't...

16:13.700 --> 16:15.600
Okay, okay, okay.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.100
I get it.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.900
So you're coming to me     
        for a job?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.300
I don't owe Cheers diddly.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.100
Well, you're                    
a darned good barkeep.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.700
And I could use                 
an extra hand.

16:26.700 --> 16:28.300
There's always         
     an upsurge of business

16:28.300 --> 16:30.700
every year after I win     
    the Bloody Mary contest.

16:32.100 --> 16:32.700
Why not?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.600
Grab an apron                   
in the back.

16:34.700 --> 16:35.700
Oh, gee,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.400
you won't regret this.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.500
Wait till

16:38.500 --> 16:41.200
I tell my mom I'm working       
     for that weasel Gary.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.900
Are you crazy?                  
He's the enemy.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.500
No, I think he's okay.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.000
I was in Cheers
                 when he quit.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.200
It was real ugly.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.900
I don't know. Uh, you           
think we can trust him?

16:53.000 --> 16:53.900
Gary?                           
            Well...

16:54.000 --> 16:55.200
Yeah?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.200
I found a nickel in             
the pocket of this apron.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.700
You know who it belongs to      
or should I put up a flyer?

16:59.700 --> 17:02.000
I think we can trust him.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.099
Afternoon, everybody.

17:09.099 --> 17:10.200
Hey, hey, Gary.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.000
Well, this is it!

17:12.000 --> 17:14.400
The day of the big contest.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.700
Hey, Woody, come here.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.099
Yes, sir.

17:18.099 --> 17:20.000
Woody, I'm gonna                
be honest with you.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.700
I had my doubts about you       
having worked at Cheers and all,

17:22.800 --> 17:25.800
but after the way you've worked 
out here this last week...

17:25.900 --> 17:27.700
you're really one of us now.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.200
Thank you.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.700
By the way, here.

17:31.800 --> 17:32.900
What is it?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.300
It came for you a few days ago.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.600
I forgot to give it to you.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.800
"This is to inform you     
        that the contest

17:38.900 --> 17:42.700
has been moved up           
two hours to 12:00 noon."

17:42.700 --> 17:44.800
You forgot to give this to me?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.100
Is it important?

17:46.200 --> 17:50.700
Oh, wait a minute.          
         Wait a minute.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.500
Damn it, boy.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.300
You and Malone set me up.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.300
You knew about this             
time change two days ago.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.200
Well, don't just stand there    
like a bump on a log.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.700
Say something.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.800
Got you, Gar.          
    ( <i>clicks tongue</i> )

18:05.200 --> 18:07.900
That means the contest     
started five minutes ago.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.700
Gee, boss,

18:09.800 --> 18:11.600
I don't think          
     you're gonna make it.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.800
I think you're gonna lose.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.400
I think you're gonna fall       
    flat on your face.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
I think...

18:18.500 --> 18:21.100
I'm gonna be hanging      
    upside down again.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.400
Get him!                        
Come on. Get him!

18:30.100 --> 18:33.800
Well, I wish I could        
    give all of you an award,

18:33.900 --> 18:35.300
but there can only
              be one winner...

18:35.300 --> 18:36.600
Surprise, Malone.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.200
I made it.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.200

You were late, man.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.600
I didn't get the message        
about the time change.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.000
They tried to keep me away,   
      but it didn't work.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.100
Yeah, right!                    
It didn't work.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.900
That's a lie and you  
          should be disqualified

18:49.900 --> 18:51.100
for making a        
            slanderous remark

18:51.100 --> 18:53.400

Yeah, we set       
             the whole thing up.

Yeah, that way we can      
     get Gary out of here

20:08.300 --> 20:09.900
before the real contest starts.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.900
And when you made such a fool of
yourself pretending to be a nun?

20:11.900 --> 20:13.200
That was part   
                of the plan.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.300
When you went                   
to work for Gary?               
            Part of the plan.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.300
When you told Gary the time   
  of the contest had changed?

20:17.300 --> 20:18.600
All part of the plan.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.200
Hey, guys...

20:20.300 --> 20:22.700
I'm ready for the real contest.

Yeah!

20:38.700 --> 20:40.400
( <i>groans</i> )

20:40.400 --> 20:43.100
Where have I heard that before?

20:43.100 --> 20:45.300
You know, Sam,

20:45.300 --> 20:47.900
that was a stroke of genius   
    having Li'l Abner there

20:48.000 --> 20:49.800
playing the judge.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.400
And I got to admit I fell for it

20:51.400 --> 20:53.900
until I got           
     within about 20 feet.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.700
Very funny.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.700
You know, we're gonna           
get you next year, Gary,

20:57.800 --> 20:59.100
and it's not going
              to be very pretty.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.100
Oh, yeah?                       
                    Yeah.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.000
Oh, yeah?                       
                        Yeah.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.400
Don't try to outfox me          
because you can't.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.300
Every time you think            
you got me fooled,

21:06.300 --> 21:07.900
I'm one step ahead of you.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.900
But I got to admit,             
this time you came...

21:10.900 --> 21:12.100
that close.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.300
( <i>laughs</i> )

21:13.300 --> 21:14.700
Very funny.           
          Very funny.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.300
I can't believe he did it again.

21:19.300 --> 21:22.400
Uh, 45... 50.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.800
Carla, what are you doing?

21:23.800 --> 21:27.500
I mean, you usually pay off   
a judge after you <i>win</i> a contest.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.200
If the contest that
             had just happened

21:29.200 --> 21:31.300
were the real contest--
         which it wasn't--

21:31.300 --> 21:33.500
and if this guy     
            were the real judge,

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
which he's not.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.700
You follow any of that?

21:37.700 --> 21:39.600
This is my next-
                door neighbor.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.800
The real judge is some  
        old lady from Cambridge.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.300
Thanks for helping
              out, Larry.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.300
Any time, Carla.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.400
Wait a minute.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.200
If this wasn't the real contest,
when is the real contest?

21:51.300 --> 21:53.000
In about a half an hour.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.700
Are you telling me    
          we still have a chance

21:54.700 --> 21:55.900
to win this thing?              
                    We sure do!

21:57.500 --> 21:59.600
Carla! Carla!

21:59.600 --> 22:03.500
Carla! Carla! Carla! Carla!

22:03.500 --> 22:05.200
Carla! Carla!

22:05.300 --> 22:06.400
Carla...

22:06.400 --> 22:07.800
How long have you               
had this planned?

22:07.800 --> 22:09.400
Since about...

22:09.500 --> 22:11.700
a minute after we lost
          last year's contest.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.500
This is unbelievable.   
What?!

22:13.600 --> 22:15.400
That I could come up      
    with a great plan?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.600
No, that you'd pay
              this guy money

22:16.700 --> 22:17.700
out of your own pocket.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.300
Get real.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.200
I lifted Gary's wallet     
  when he was leaving the bar.

22:25.600 --> 22:29.900
Thank God you are on our side.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.900
And from here on in,      
    whether we win or lose,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.700
what's really important         
to remember--

22:34.800 --> 22:35.500
and I'm saying this

22:35.600 --> 22:38.100
in the spirit of true sportsmen 
          everywhere--

22:38.100 --> 22:39.800
is Gary won't win!

22:39.800 --> 22:42.100
Yeah!              
        Gary won't win!

22:42.100 --> 22:43.700
Gary won't win!

22:43.700 --> 22:44.900
Gary won't win!

22:44.900 --> 22:46.100
Hey, guys...

22:46.200 --> 22:48.000
I am on to you.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.600
Oh, man, I give up.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.500
Now hand over my wallet.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.700
Your what?

22:58.700 --> 23:00.800
Come on.            
    Somebody took my wallet.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.600
Yeah, someone   
                handed it in.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.700
You must've dropped it

23:03.700 --> 23:04.900
when you were   
                leaving the bar.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.300
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.400
So long, chumps.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.000

23:14.200 --> 23:16.000
( <i>whispers</i> ):                   
Gary won't win.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.800
( <i>whispering</i> ):         
        Gary won't win.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.600
Gary won't win.
