WEBVTT

00:17.518 --> 00:20.100
Predawn callisthenics.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.428
Awesome.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.264
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.771
--Want to talk about it?
--No. There's nothing to talk about.

00:27.862 --> 00:32.606
Right. So, the whole "not being able
to save Lou Ann from death row,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.816
Vex claiming he had info
about your mom" thing--

00:34.911 --> 00:36.651
Never happened.

00:36.746 --> 00:39.158
Well, someone thinks it did.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.285
Your Fae pals are leaving
messages on my cell phone.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.286
Who is?

00:43.377 --> 00:45.663
Trick wants you to come to the bar.

00:45.755 --> 00:48.713
Or does he not exist either?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.879
--Come here.
--What?

00:54.555 --> 00:58.468
We'll go for one drink. I really need
a break from the Fae and their shit.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.595
[KENZI] Mm-hmm.

01:08.945 --> 01:13.029
And cue the Fae and their shit.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.860
Snake.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.663
You look good.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.661
--So, you are alive.
--Barely.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.832
Look, if you want to talk
about what happened--

01:25.920 --> 01:27.581
No disrespect, but I'd rather not.

01:27.672 --> 01:30.835
I'm only here 'cause I wanted
to say this face-to-face--

01:30.925 --> 01:34.543
Thank you. But right now,
what I really need is a vacation.

01:34.637 --> 01:37.049
Fae-cation.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.675
Well, maybe all this will help.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.427
Yeah, it seems like a helluva party.

01:40.518 --> 01:43.681
It's not a party. It's La Shoshain.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.011
--La Whatnow?
--La Whatnow?

01:45.106 --> 01:49.566
La Shoshain. It's the most
sacred day of the year for a Fae.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.267
I thought you should see it.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.226
Seems like a party.

01:52.321 --> 01:55.609
Well, it is that one time of the
year where Light and Dark Fae

01:55.700 --> 01:59.033
can get up close and
personal with each other.

02:02.665 --> 02:07.079
how can I put this delicately,
fornicate across party lines.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.707
So, it is a party. I am
really liking this Fae Day.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.880
It's not "Fae Day." It's--

02:12.967 --> 02:14.878
--La Shoshain.
--La Shoshain.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.960
Good. It's spiritual.

02:17.054 --> 02:20.137
Sure thing, T-Man. You got any
Fae Day signature cocktails,

02:20.224 --> 02:21.725
'cause we're going to take two.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.424
To go.

02:36.907 --> 02:41.276
[wailing]

02:42.830 --> 02:44.286
Ow.

02:47.710 --> 02:48.745
What was that?

02:48.836 --> 02:54.251
Fae! The celebration is over.
The celebration is over!

02:54.342 --> 02:56.298
That was a Banshee.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.592
A Banshee? Wait, don't they
have something to do with--

02:58.679 --> 03:02.467
Death? Yes, they do. They predict it.

03:04.018 --> 03:08.136
Someone in here is going to die... soon.

03:11.901 --> 03:14.859
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.812
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.819
My love carries a death sentence.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.026
l was lost for years,

03:23.120 --> 03:25.782
searching, while hiding,

03:25.873 --> 03:29.991
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:30.086 --> 03:35.001
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.340
[TRICK] Come on. Let's go!

03:42.431 --> 03:47.926
I'll say it again--anyone not
of the five families, clear out!

03:48.938 --> 03:50.519
Come on!

03:52.650 --> 03:56.609
The rest of you, first
round's on the house.

03:58.406 --> 04:01.068
So, tell me about these five families.

04:01.158 --> 04:06.494
Banshees wail only for the noble
families. Five human and five Fae.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.822
And if you're not of noble
blood, then you're safe.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.578
That's the theory.

04:11.669 --> 04:16.254
You're awfully curious for someone
who wants to take a break from us all.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.922
I got your message. You got a
way of finding this Banshee?

04:19.009 --> 04:22.251
[TRICK] Yeah. Give me a second.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.176
I haven't seen you in a while.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.506
Yeah well, I needed some space.
Lots to think about.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.388
The booking agent's downtown.
The agent's human. Tread lightly.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.559
So, what, you're going
to find this Banshee

04:31.647 --> 04:33.353
and make her take back her scream?

04:33.441 --> 04:36.103
Banshees don't cause death.
They foretell it.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.525
And they can't take it back.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.443
But you can make a Banshee talk.

04:40.531 --> 04:43.944
Tell you who the wail is for.
I'm going to show you how.

04:44.034 --> 04:44.944
Me?

04:45.035 --> 04:49.199
La Shoshain is a holy day. We can't
feed, use our gifts, or use violence.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.530
Ahh.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.615
But you, being secular,
aren't bound by those laws.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.871
--Ask nicely.
--You'd be helping out.

04:54.962 --> 04:55.872
Say please.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.876
You don't know who your family is.
Maybe you have noble blood.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.207
Maybe the Banshee wailed for you.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.384
Close enough. Kenzi.

05:03.471 --> 05:07.555
You guys knock yourselves out.
This food isn't going to eat itself.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.929
It would be best if only
the noble families stayed.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.261
Hey, I could have noble blood.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.892
No, like if some duke boned
my great-great-grandmother.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.224
I am sure she was a real hot wench.

05:18.319 --> 05:22.733
[TRICK] Fine. Don't eat everything.
Get the hell out of my way!

05:22.823 --> 05:25.235
Is Trick going to be okay?

05:25.326 --> 05:28.489
Give me a second.
I'll meet you in the car.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.249
What's all this?

05:35.336 --> 05:36.917
Lou Ann's.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.461
Well, how did you end up with it?

05:41.342 --> 05:43.424
I intervened in her execution.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.127
She left to go into hiding this morning.

05:46.222 --> 05:47.928
Since when do you help the Dark?

05:48.015 --> 05:51.599
Lou Ann was the midwife
at Bo's birth. We owe her.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.267
Trick, when are we going to
stop keeping Bo in the dark

05:54.355 --> 05:55.765
about who her mother is?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.642
As long as we can.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.440
You're doing well.

06:00.528 --> 06:04.191
No, I'm lying to her.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.272
You chose to get emotionally involved.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.653
Maybe you should, too.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.819
What do we do if Aife shows up?

06:11.914 --> 06:17.284
When she shows up, there
will have to be a reckoning.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.494
Better go find that Banshee.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.670
The sooner we find out
who she cried for,

06:21.757 --> 06:24.715
the sooner they can
plan for their death.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.840
I'm surprised you're
not taking the stairs.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.143
I thought you couldn't use
electricity on La Shoshain.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.471
[DYSON] Wrong culture.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.978
--The rules are specific.
--[BO] Like what?

06:41.068 --> 06:43.980
No powers. No Fae-on-Fae violence.
No feeding on humans.

06:44.071 --> 06:44.981
It's all about sacrifice.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.858
That sounds pretty heavy.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.156
Well, it's to commemorate the
sacrifice made by the Blood King.

06:49.243 --> 06:53.828
Blood King, blood sacrifice, it's a whole
lot of blood and not many details.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.077
Well, we're talking about stuff that
happened over a thousand years ago.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.498
It's more myth than fact.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.326
So, there are stories, then?

07:00.421 --> 07:05.666
Yes, there are stories. But all that
really remains are the written laws.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.001
Okay, but you must know one story.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.088
Bo, read a book.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.509
Honey, the cruise ship
circuit's nothing to sneeze at.

07:16.604 --> 07:20.188
No, four words--all you can eat.

07:20.274 --> 07:24.108
Yeah. Yeah, you can sleep on it--
in your crack house you call a home.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.231
Stand-up comedians, it's like they
want to be miserable or something.

07:27.323 --> 07:29.689
Okay, what can I help you with?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.239
--Siobhan McManus.
--Uh huh.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.864
We need to ask her a few questions
about a gig she just played.

07:33.954 --> 07:38.698
Oh, Siobhan? Yeah, she's a
gorgeous girl. She's a bit of a flake.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.373
She called me from the bus station,

07:40.461 --> 07:41.871
cancelled all her bookings
for the whole week.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.544
I'll tell you what, if you find her,
why don't you bring her to me

07:44.632 --> 07:46.714
and I'll wring her little neck, okay?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.256
[sneezing sound]

07:50.888 --> 07:52.674
Can I get you a coffee?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.266
Gesundheit.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.688
We're going to need to use your
office for about twenty minutes.

08:06.862 --> 08:10.696
What? Death gives me an appetite.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.820
See that guy?

08:14.912 --> 08:17.073
Almost nine hundred years old.

08:17.164 --> 08:21.328
If anyone's checking out in
the next little while, it's him.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.411
You want to start a death pool?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.121
Oh, so you gamble?

08:27.216 --> 08:31.209
If the stakes are right.
What do you got?

08:33.013 --> 08:39.760
This sucks. All I wanted was to play
the gig, get paid, get wasted, get laid.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.844
I hate being made to talk.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.930
Well, if there's any other
way we can get it out of you--

08:44.024 --> 08:48.438
Well, there isn't, okay? It's all
buried in my stupid unconscious.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.568
Make sure those are tight,
chicky-boo. This gets messy.

09:01.875 --> 09:05.208
Oh, please tell me
you are not going to...

09:11.093 --> 09:13.300
--That'll make her talk?
--Yeah.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.049
My kind has a real bad
allergic reaction to iron.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.052
Oh, no. No, no, no. Back
away with the liver shake.

09:19.143 --> 09:22.135
I can't get physical today.
You got to force her to drink this.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.469
What do you mean "force"?

09:23.564 --> 09:25.680
l have the worst gag reflex.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.560
Let's get this shit over with.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.611
I am so sorry.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.376
--[BO] Is she okay?
--[DYSON] Just give it a second.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.013
Is this Siobhan?

10:00.100 --> 10:05.060
It is the voice of the ancient
mourners, the grieving ones.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.387
There has been a call to death.

10:06.482 --> 10:11.522
We are bound to the old families.
We cry for their loss.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.775
--Which family?
--Kavanagh.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.526
[DYSON] Which Kavanagh?

10:16.617 --> 10:18.824
The one named Sean.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.365
[DYSON] How long does he have?

10:22.456 --> 10:25.072
He will not live past sundown.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.788
[DYSON] You might want to step back.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.085
Why? What happens now?

10:30.172 --> 10:32.584
Are you done yet?

10:32.674 --> 10:35.086
You're not done yet. I got it.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.551
Super. Now I won't be able
to get out of bed for a week.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.598
Can you get me a towel or something?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.812
Okay.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.761
Oh, two, that's the lucky pig, right?

10:47.856 --> 10:50.313
No, no, no, no, no.
Those are the wedding gifts,

10:50.400 --> 10:53.267
okay, not even a pig
steals from a wedding.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.818
Fine. Jeez.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.900
And twelve is king.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.151
[KENZI] Are you serious?

10:59.243 --> 11:00.608
It's good to be king.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.445
Nice rolling, dude.
You working some dice voodoo?

11:04.540 --> 11:05.575
What the hell's your power?

11:05.666 --> 11:07.247
Oh, no, I'm just lucky.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.450
And I wouldn't use my abilities
on La Shoshain, anyway.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.501
That would be plain wrong.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.089
Yeah, yeah, but I just want to know

11:13.173 --> 11:15.164
with whom I'm having
the pleasure, okay?

11:15.259 --> 11:18.922
So, do you, like, eat corpses or
have a detachable head or what?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.923
Really, it's not polite to ask.

11:21.014 --> 11:27.431
Come on. The Banshee! I may
only have a few hours to live.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.638
Since you're dying.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.189
I'm good with money.

11:33.277 --> 11:35.643
How good?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.775
I attract wealth.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.448
You don't say?

11:41.535 --> 11:43.947
Yeah. And I'm also really
good with numbers.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.529
So, I do the books for some
major charities around town.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.659
Charities?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.036
--Uh huh.
--Great.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.995
You ever skim a little off the top?

11:54.089 --> 11:56.796
Do I look like that kind of guy?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.294
I'm just joshing you, man.

11:58.385 --> 12:02.003
Joking about accounting fraud is
like joking about a bomb on a plane.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.883
Issues.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.674
Kavanagh.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.760
Sean Kavanagh.

12:11.607 --> 12:16.522
Ha, ha, ha! Not my time yet.
Take that, suckers!

12:16.612 --> 12:18.944
Ha, ha, ha.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.241
So, who's Kavanagh?

12:37.758 --> 12:40.716
How's it hanging, Seany-boy?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.839
I just found out I'll be dead by sunset.

12:43.931 --> 12:50.097
Pffft. I say you hunker down,
get a few pints and just wait it out.

12:50.187 --> 12:54.226
I know the old stories, okay.
If a Banshee wails for you, that's it.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.898
Your death finds you,
no matter where you hide.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.067
So, what are you going to do about it?

12:59.154 --> 13:00.690
Die, I guess.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.942
No, man!

13:03.033 --> 13:06.116
You are going to make a list
of things you didn't get to do

13:06.203 --> 13:07.784
and you're going to do them.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.372
You think I should make a bucket list?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.196
Exactly.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.249
Okay, so, how about it? Any regrets?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.170
I have one.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.594
So, are Banshees ever wrong?

13:26.682 --> 13:27.717
Not that I know of.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.140
Well, if Fae aren't allowed to
use their powers on La Shoshain,

13:30.227 --> 13:32.388
how was the Banshee able to scream?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.266
Fae aren't allowed to use
their powers voluntarily.

13:35.357 --> 13:41.978
A Banshee's wail is complete reflex.
Every Fae child knows that.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.778
You know, I'm trying to figure
out if it is the Banshee,

13:43.865 --> 13:47.278
or just my ignorance that has
put you in such a foul mood.

13:47.369 --> 13:51.829
I'm not in a foul mood.
It's just I've got a lot on my mind.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.626
It's early writings of
La Shoshain and the Blood King.

13:58.714 --> 14:02.127
--Shut you up for a little while.
--What language is this?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.959
Also available in translation.

14:10.934 --> 14:15.268
Okay, hey, Sean has something
he would like to say. Go ahead.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.686
--Yeah, hi.
--Hi.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.686
I've been thinking about, you
know, my personal situation

14:20.777 --> 14:22.938
and what I'd like to do
before my personal situation

14:23.030 --> 14:25.521
comes into full effect and whatnot.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.947
And see, there's also
this family situation.

14:28.035 --> 14:32.324
Sean would like to reconcile with
his asshole brother before he dies.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.822
So, what's the deal?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.782
Liam's Dark Fae.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.541
He turned his back on our Light Fae
family more than eighty years ago.

14:41.631 --> 14:42.711
I haven't seen him since.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.460
--That's too bad.
--[SEAN] Yeah.

14:44.551 --> 14:49.887
And this is my very last chance to
tell him that... that it's all forgiven.

14:49.973 --> 14:53.010
And you have exactly six hours and
twenty-one minutes to get him here.

14:53.101 --> 14:57.014
I can pay you, okay, whatever you
want. I won't need it anymore.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.972
Let's just call this one a freebie, okay?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.479
Where should I start looking?

15:02.569 --> 15:06.858
Liam feeds on human greed.
I know exactly where he is.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.528
I'll stay.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.989
Be my backup?

15:18.085 --> 15:23.921
This is my one day off from
cops and Fae to drink in peace.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.589
Oh, poor baby.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.304
You're driving.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.769
Excuse me.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.191
Liam's been linked with
pyramid schemes in the past.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.610
Looks like his latest one just toppled.

15:47.697 --> 15:52.236
This is nothing but a scam.
You're all frauds!

15:52.327 --> 15:54.409
Where's my money, you bastard?!

15:58.034 --> 15:58.125
It's my life savings.
Please, give it back to me.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.209
[LIAM] Don't play the market
if you don't have the cojones.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.547
Chop, chop, people. I want
this place gutted in an hour.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.713
Liam Kavanagh.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.587
Hello, lovely. You like sushi?

16:09.678 --> 16:12.761
I know a chef, trained under Nobu.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.715
Holds a table for me every night.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.141
Your brother Sean wants to see you.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.891
My brother is a self-righteous ass.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.563
I want nothing to do with him.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.231
Well, he says everything is forgiven.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.277
Ha. He's the one who should
be begging me for forgiveness.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.777
Oh, I see, he didn't tell
you the delightful story

16:32.868 --> 16:35.075
in which he completely screws me over?

16:35.162 --> 16:40.077
It doesn't matter. A Banshee wailed
for him. He'll be dead by sundown.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.658
Well, I look forward to reading his obit.

16:46.715 --> 16:49.673
Triple twenty. I feel a
perfect game coming on.

16:49.759 --> 16:53.798
Yeah, man, your dart technique is
amazing. You should have gone pro.

16:53.889 --> 16:59.350
The trick, my young apprentice,
is to throw between heartbeats.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.768
Once again, please!

17:01.855 --> 17:06.315
Dude! When does the lame-o-go-round
stop? I need to get off before I puke.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.437
Come on. I love this song.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.112
The whole idea when you're
dying is to break out of your shell,

17:12.199 --> 17:17.489
not throw on an extra coat of wax,
okay? So, think big. Think bucket list.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.284
Well, Mylene over there,

17:21.374 --> 17:24.707
I always kind of fancied her,
but I never had the guts to tell her.

17:24.794 --> 17:28.332
Fancied? Oh my god.
All right. Go get her, tiger.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.629
Go get her. Come on,
I want to see some tongue,

17:29.716 --> 17:32.503
I want to see some
booty action. Go! Go!

17:47.067 --> 17:48.557
Well, she was very kind about it.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.688
Shot down, huh? Shitty.

17:50.779 --> 17:55.694
No. You know, it's good.
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.823
Thanks, Kenzi. You're very odd
and special, you know that?

17:59.913 --> 18:02.905
So, what else is on the bucket list?

18:02.999 --> 18:07.663
Well, speaking of romance,
I've never kissed a human.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.961
Don't push your luck, perv.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.387
I'm sorry. It's not like I was
trying to keep anything from you.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.681
I just didn't realize
Liam still blamed me.

18:21.768 --> 18:25.511
If you want to reconcile,
Sean, we need the whole story.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.938
I was 18. Liam was 16.
Right before his Gathering.

18:29.025 --> 18:29.889
And a Gathering is...?

18:29.985 --> 18:33.694
It's the coming-of-age ceremony
where a Fae chooses Light or Dark.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.237
Hey, you had one of those.
Tres Conan the Barbarian.

18:36.324 --> 18:40.693
That was the old way. These days,
it's more like a Fae Bar Mitzvah.

18:40.787 --> 18:44.120
Oh, wow. Maybe if I'd actually chosen
a side, I could have scored some gifts.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.947
Well, everyone in our family
has always chosen Light.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.124
Liam would have been no different.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.203
He was a screw-up,
but basically a good kid.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.289
How screwed up are we talking here?

18:53.383 --> 18:57.752
Pretty bad. Partying,
stealing, getting into scraps.

18:57.846 --> 19:01.259
Oh, yeah. Sounds like a disaster.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.431
But, like me, he was always
a whiz with numbers.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.724
You know, Dad had hoped
that he'd settle down

19:04.811 --> 19:07.302
if he were just given
some responsibility.

19:07.397 --> 19:11.390
So, he had us both helping out with
the books at the investment office.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.270
And that's when money
went missing from the safe.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.443
--How much?
--Thirty thousand dollars.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.896
Now, that was a lot of money back then.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.449
And I was the one that was supposed
to be setting the example for Liam.

19:21.536 --> 19:22.992
He was my responsibility.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.331
What did you do?

19:25.415 --> 19:28.282
I wanted to teach him a lesson,

19:28.376 --> 19:31.914
--so I called the police.
--Ohh. Dick move, man!

19:32.005 --> 19:33.165
But then, instead of facing the music,

19:33.256 --> 19:36.419
Liam, he ran away from home
as soon as he made bail.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.295
And he joined the Dark Fae.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.763
The only one of us he ever
kept in touch with was Mom.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.806
She always doted on him.
But now she's dead.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.474
So, Liam's all alone?

19:46.561 --> 19:52.306
Look, Light or Dark, | just want
him to know that I still love him.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.857
Before I'm gone.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.275
Maybe you won't kick it.

19:56.363 --> 20:00.322
I mean, what the hell is this
Banshee's batting average?

20:13.713 --> 20:18.002
Whatever it takes, Sean,
I'll bring you your brother.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.004
Better hurry.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.013
It's only a matter of time.
Sunset, to be exact.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.218
--It was a fluke.
--It was fate.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.473
Well, whatever. You've still
got some gonzo living to do

20:31.564 --> 20:33.520
and I'm not letting you
do it in a stuffy pub.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.690
Okay, what do you have in mind?

20:40.115 --> 20:41.355
I told you you were a natural.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.690
I can't believe I'm doing this.

20:43.785 --> 20:44.820
Do you like the car?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.526
Very much. But it's breaking the law.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.784
What are they going to do, execute
you? Get your skinny ass in there.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.627
All right. Now, twist the
red one with the yellow one.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.591
Now, touch the black one to them.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.559
--Holy shit!
--Oh, O.G. in the house.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.011
Okay, don't stall it.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.690
Maybe this is how I die.
In a fiery, mangled wreck.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.687
Are you sure you don't
want to take a pass?

21:18.778 --> 21:24.739
It is the fiery, mangly potential
that gives it the thrill! Okay, give 'er!

21:24.826 --> 21:30.446
Yes! Okay, come on.
Step on the gas, Sean. Go.

21:30.540 --> 21:34.078
Wooo!

21:42.010 --> 21:43.750
--Bo, I want to--
--No, I know.

21:43.845 --> 21:47.053
Staking out some creepy investment
banker in a crappy parking lot

21:47.140 --> 21:49.381
is not your ideal La Shoshain.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.387
Nowhere else I'd rather be.

21:51.478 --> 21:53.264
Yeah, right.

21:58.234 --> 22:03.820
Bo, I want you to know...
I do what I can to protect you.

22:03.907 --> 22:07.274
I know. I trust you
without a second thought.

22:12.332 --> 22:16.120
Mr. Sparkly Conversation,
however, you are not.

22:26.930 --> 22:31.924
Sweet cheese muffins.
What are we doing here?

22:32.018 --> 22:34.930
Thought I should see
my dad one last time.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.479
[KENZI] Noble blood, huh? Nice gig.

22:57.919 --> 22:58.829
--Hey, Dad.
"Sean.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.663
Did we schedule an appointment?

23:02.757 --> 23:05.874
No, sir, I just wanted to drop by.

23:05.969 --> 23:09.461
My son seems to have lost his manners.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.468
--Patrick Kavanagh.
--Yo. Kenzi.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.971
What brings you two?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.473
A Banshee.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.646
A Banshee wailed for me.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.983
You sure?

23:21.067 --> 23:22.307
Yes, sir.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.518
How long?

23:24.612 --> 23:26.694
Sundown.

23:26.781 --> 23:29.648
That doesn't give you much
time to get your estate in order.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.154
I'll call Henry to verify
your will is up-to-date.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.408
No. That's not how I'm going
to spend my last afternoon.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.238
You don't want to leave
a mess behind you.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.710
Who cares if I do?

23:39.794 --> 23:42.331
All my life, I've fallen in line.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.882
A Kavanagh prides himself
in maintaining control,

23:47.969 --> 23:49.925
even in his darkest hours.

23:50.013 --> 23:55.098
Well, a friend of mine has shown me that
a dead man gets to go a little crazy.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.721
And that's what I'm going to
do with the rest of my time.

23:59.355 --> 24:03.098
I just wanted to
come say good-bye.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.274
Tell you I love you.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.856
I'll send you the details for the funeral.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.781
[PATRICK] Sean.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.655
Sean!

24:18.791 --> 24:22.124
I do care, of course.

24:22.211 --> 24:25.419
Sean always did overreact. Liam, too.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.792
Got that from his mother.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.419
Now, if you'll excuse me.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.259
Yeah, I'll let you get back
to your important work.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.763
Betting on the fights, huh?

24:38.853 --> 24:40.935
Bobby Bell, he's a long-shot loser.

24:41.022 --> 24:46.187
He's old and tired and
has no heart whatsoever.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.114
Did you know that the Blood King
personally wrote all the rules

24:54.202 --> 24:55.908
that govern Fae society?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.451
--Yeah.
--And look, this is really cool--

24:57.538 --> 25:00.826
During the first World War,
French and German Fae soldiers

25:00.917 --> 25:04.785
put down their weapons and secretly
celebrated La Shoshain together.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.915
Heartwarming, isn't it?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.746
[cell phone ringing]

25:08.841 --> 25:11.048
[BO] Kenzi's headed home.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.629
Hey, there's our mark.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.759
Roger dodger. You coming?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.511
[DYSON] I think you get it.

25:23.773 --> 25:26.765
Hey, that's a nice car.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.475
Either you didn't hear me when I said
that I don't want to see my brother,

25:29.570 --> 25:32.312
or you're looking to invest.
And I don't see a chequebook.

25:32.407 --> 25:35.149
Yeah, well, I've got
something better than that.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.866
Hey. Let's do some blow and get crazy.

25:40.957 --> 25:44.449
Sure, sure. Maybe after you come
with me to see your brother.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.034
Can you do that for me?

25:46.129 --> 25:48.290
I don't want to watch Sean die.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.121
Maybe the Banshee was wrong.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.457
Maybe there's nothing to worry about.

25:52.552 --> 25:56.716
He better die. I sure paid enough for it.

26:00.226 --> 26:04.469
Hey, babe, just forget Sean, okay?
He's already history.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.806
You put a hit out on
your brother? Why?

26:07.900 --> 26:14.396
All I do is destroy lives. I'm a
worthless, piece-of-shit monster.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.318
Because of Sean.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.653
That was eighty years ago.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.660
And that's how long I've
been waiting for Mom to die.

26:24.751 --> 26:29.996
So that I could kill Sean
without breaking her heart.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.206
What did you send after your brother?

26:35.428 --> 26:38.010
Drive fancy car, check.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.837
Tell off Dad, check.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.514
Check. Overdose on grease.

26:42.602 --> 26:46.186
That's actually on my list.
Never mind. What's next?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.513
Well, if there were time,
I'd suggest skydiving.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.099
Skydiving.

26:51.194 --> 26:53.776
--Friend of yours?
--[SEAN] No. Yours?

26:53.863 --> 26:55.399
Run!

27:03.790 --> 27:05.451
--What is that thing?
--|t's a Goblin.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.873
They have no respect for
any Fae or human rules,

27:07.960 --> 27:09.871
but they like inflicting pain.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.580
--We're not going to die quickly.
--We're not dying, period.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.460
You won't. I'll give myself up.

27:15.551 --> 27:19.043
Don't be stupid. Let's go.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.423
The Banshee wailed for me.

27:20.515 --> 27:23.473
I can't escape death, but I won't
drag anyone else into my fate.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.722
Especially not someone
as wonderful as you.

27:26.813 --> 27:27.598
Dickhead.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.730
I don't believe in fate. You make
your own future. You fight for it.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.684
You cannot fight a
Banshee's prediction.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.280
We can.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.282
--Kenzi!
--[KENZI] Bo, watch out! There's a--

27:54.841 --> 27:56.377
Where'd he go?

28:16.779 --> 28:19.270
Hey. Hey. You okay?

28:19.365 --> 28:23.608
Dyson, hey, I thought you weren't
allowed to use violence today?

28:23.703 --> 28:25.489
Only to protect a life.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.821
Complicated set of rules.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.167
Actually, it's pretty intuitive.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.665
--[SEAN] But where did it come from?
--Your brother hired it.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.795
To kill me?

28:40.887 --> 28:43.128
He's been holding a bit of a grudge.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.804
But this... this is too far!

28:45.892 --> 28:47.883
[KENZI] Sean, it's okay. You're safe now.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.468
No. No. Where is he now?

28:50.563 --> 28:52.895
We left him at his office.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.222
Come here. You're going to be fine.

28:54.317 --> 28:56.148
Do you want some water?
I'll get you some water.

28:56.235 --> 29:00.069
And I'm willing to bet the Goblin
disposal agency is closed today.

29:00.156 --> 29:02.317
[DYSON] We'll do this one by the book.
We'll report it to the Ash.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.364
[BO] Oh, great. Love that guy.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.192
This time, he's your best friend.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.654
He'll call in a cleaner for this and
he'll lodge a protest with the Morrigan.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.159
Because once the Goblins take on a hit,

29:11.250 --> 29:12.865
they do not stop until
they kill their mark.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.871
Well, do you think she'll step in?

29:14.962 --> 29:17.203
Liam made an unsanctioned
hit against the Light

29:17.298 --> 29:20.415
on the most sacred of Fae holidays.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.000
The powers that be are going
to come down on him heavy.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.679
The powers that be better get
to Liam before Sean does.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.132
I think he took your crossbow.

29:44.283 --> 29:48.868
It's La Shoshain. You hurt me,
that is a big freakin' no-no.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.695
At least I went through
an intermediary.

29:50.790 --> 29:54.578
Coming after me is one thing.
Putting people I care about in danger--

29:54.669 --> 29:59.083
Oh, really? You're putting more
value on people than on rules?

29:59.173 --> 30:00.959
Well, it's about time!

30:04.971 --> 30:06.381
You don't have it in ya.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.133
Let's find out.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.716
Agallamh!

30:11.811 --> 30:12.926
I invoke Agallamh.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.396
What?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.721
[BO] You know, Agallamh.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.101
The rule by which any Fae

30:18.192 --> 30:21.229
can force warring parties
to sit down for peace talks

30:21.320 --> 30:24.904
on La Shoshain. It has to be obeyed.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.073
I read it in Trick's book.
I can get the book.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.569
We know what it is.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.073
--No one has invoked Agallamh--
--|n forever.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.119
You want to know why?

30:33.207 --> 30:34.322
Probably not.

30:34.417 --> 30:40.128
Because the person who calls for
the talks forfeits her life if they fail.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.085
But it's La Shoshain.

30:44.176 --> 30:48.636
It's not violence. It's a sacrifice.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.135
I really should have
skipped to the end, huh?

31:04.196 --> 31:05.857
Invoking Agallamh is not a game!

31:05.948 --> 31:06.778
I know.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.152
It's the most sacred ceremony
on the most sacred day.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.700
It's a distillation of everything
the Blood King stood for,

31:11.787 --> 31:15.279
all he achieved. And it will
probably end in your death.

31:15.374 --> 31:19.788
That is why I need your
help to do it right.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.744
Of course.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.102
The Agallamh is opened.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.605
It shall not be closed,
except by sacrifice.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.937
Don't dawdle. Sean's death
is called for sundown.

32:30.032 --> 32:34.116
If he dies before the Agallamh is
closed, it will be considered a failure.

32:34.203 --> 32:36.114
And your life will be forfeit.

32:36.205 --> 32:37.695
Who kills me?

32:37.790 --> 32:40.281
I think you need to get a volunteer.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.832
What?

32:45.172 --> 32:52.886
Is there one from the community who
will step forward as the Claymore?

32:52.972 --> 32:56.214
I'll be your Claymore.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.390
Thanks.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.513
I think.

33:02.690 --> 33:07.229
Yes. I called the police on Liam after
I found out he stole Dad's money.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.903
I was a stupid kid.
Should I be killed for that?

33:10.990 --> 33:12.070
Retort?

33:12.158 --> 33:14.319
For making me look bad
in the eyes of our parents?

33:14.410 --> 33:16.617
And for ruining my life
by falsely accusing me?

33:16.704 --> 33:18.786
Yes. My brother deserves to die.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.079
Falsely accusing?

33:20.166 --> 33:21.747
--But you took the money!
--[BO] Hey. Hey.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.244
——I didn't!
--[BO] Hey!

33:23.335 --> 33:29.251
Thou shalt not address
the interlocutor directly.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.424
You speak to me, not him.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.752
My brother did take the money.

33:34.847 --> 33:35.962
I did not.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.763
Dad gave the combination
of the safe to nobody but us.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.137
Okay, I sure as hell didn't take it.
And it was in your character.

33:41.228 --> 33:44.095
Do you see that? Always judging.
God, you are just like Dad.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.272
Hey, that's enough!

33:46.358 --> 33:50.476
That is enough. Get your gun out.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.947
I've fulfilled my obligations
to the Agallamh.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.070
It's finished.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.449
How many of these
creeps did you hire?

34:04.543 --> 34:07.000
First, the Claymore kills you.

34:07.087 --> 34:11.456
And then the Goblin
takes care of my brother.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.632
There will be no violence in my house.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.459
Well, take him outside then.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.921
Closure. Put it to the community.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.550
--I put to the--
--[KENZ|] Wait!

34:22.645 --> 34:24.226
Stall for time, okay? I have a plan.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.680
I just need you to give
me more time, okay?

34:30.236 --> 34:33.478
I put to the community...

34:33.572 --> 34:37.815
...that we take a short recess.

34:37.910 --> 34:43.280
I believe we're allowed one every
four hours. So, all in favour?

34:46.252 --> 34:49.210
Great. Then smoke
them if you got them.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.971
You could save her.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.553
It's time.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.302
Give me a moment.

35:47.021 --> 35:50.104
I said it's time. Let's do this.

35:52.985 --> 35:55.226
I call the Agallamh back to order.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.733
Yeah, yeah, my petition
for closure still stands.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.280
Do I have a second?

36:04.747 --> 36:07.454
Gee, thanks.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.042
Okay, then.

36:14.715 --> 36:20.255
Under the rules of the ritual
of the sacred Agallamh

36:20.346 --> 36:24.089
on this sacred La Shoshain,

36:24.183 --> 36:27.801
I... What with due
reverence to the Blood King,

36:27.895 --> 36:30.102
I mean, there was a
fine king, am I right?

36:30.189 --> 36:33.272
--Closu re.
--0 kay.

36:33.359 --> 36:38.149
I put the motion of
closure to the community.

36:38.238 --> 36:42.607
No! No way! Negatory. We're here.

36:42.701 --> 36:46.865
I submit myself to the sacred
summons of the Agallamh.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.116
Though, for the life of me,
I don't see what good this will do.

36:49.208 --> 36:52.416
Well, let's swear you into
the inner circle and find out.

37:01.133 --> 37:01.220
All right. Ask your questions.

37:01.220 --> 37:04.007
I only have one.

37:04.098 --> 37:08.888
Why did you steal thirty thousand
dollars from your own safe?

37:08.977 --> 37:11.104
That's ridiculous.

37:12.731 --> 37:17.475
I remind the witness that speaking
a falsehood is punishable by death.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.730
So, I'll ask you again--

37:19.822 --> 37:24.407
Why did you steal thirty thousand
dollars from your own safe?

37:27.913 --> 37:32.532
I have my vices.
I keep them under control.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.162
What did you do?

37:34.253 --> 37:38.337
It was a gambling debt, wasn't it?
That's your thing, right?

37:38.424 --> 37:40.836
Use investor money
to cover your losses,

37:40.926 --> 37:43.838
move cash around so no one notices?

37:43.929 --> 37:48.844
Liam, here, is a real chip
off the ol' block, pops.

37:48.934 --> 37:53.098
You boys had no reason to
be at the safe that weekend.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.053
You should never have known.

37:55.149 --> 37:59.267
I was being thorough, Dad.
Just like you taught me.

37:59.361 --> 38:03.730
You let me take the fall.
You let them lock me up.

38:03.824 --> 38:05.405
I bailed you out the very next day.

38:05.492 --> 38:11.863
I-I didn't expect you to be a baby and
go running off and joining the Dark.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.913
All this time...

38:17.463 --> 38:21.797
I couldn't tell anyone.

38:21.884 --> 38:25.968
Your mother would have left me.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.763
Think, think of what it would
have done to the family name.

38:29.850 --> 38:33.388
You put your own reputation ahead
of the happiness of your sons.

38:33.479 --> 38:38.519
It's an illness. Gambling's a disease.

38:40.903 --> 38:46.819
I would like to recognize the error I
made in assuming my brother's guilt.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.907
This is the family pendant.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.329
It is the symbol of the birthright.

38:57.836 --> 39:03.502
One day when he passes, you will
have control over the family holdings.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.378
You deserve it.

39:11.767 --> 39:14.554
With my sacrifice, I move for peace.

39:16.188 --> 39:22.809
The sacrifice has been offered.
Do you offer one in return?

39:22.903 --> 39:28.114
I'll pay back as much as I can
to the people I've ripped off...

39:28.200 --> 39:34.321
...if Dad moves Mom's grave to
neutral ground so I can visit it.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.826
lwill.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.329
Then I also call off the hit.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.380
Then we have a peace.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.720
I move for closure.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.390
I second the motion.

39:59.273 --> 40:01.855
[SEAN] Thanks for not giving up on me.

40:02.943 --> 40:07.152
[KENZI] Sundown, Bo. You saved
him and you beat the Banshee.

40:07.239 --> 40:10.151
[BO] We beat the Banshee.
It was a fifty-fifty effort.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.075
Well, if we're being honest,
I'd peg it more at thirty-seventy.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.992
'Cause let's face it, all you
did was read from a book.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.537
Oh, well, who was the one
who put her life on the line?

40:17.624 --> 40:21.412
Who was the one who didn't know she
was putting her life on the line, hmm?

40:21.503 --> 40:22.868
What about Dad?

40:22.963 --> 40:27.548
I don't know. Treatment, I guess.
If he can be talked into it.

40:28.969 --> 40:30.675
Good peace.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.219
Long peace.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.683
Yo, does this mean we're
cozy with the Fae again?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.933
Well, let's just say I haven't
completely written them off.

40:42.024 --> 40:43.935
Well, thank you very much.

40:44.026 --> 40:47.518
Could you be driving something that
makes you look like more of an asshole?

40:47.613 --> 40:52.027
Hey, how are the chicks supposed to
know I'm rich if I don't stand out, right?

40:52.117 --> 40:54.449
Where's my money, Kavanagh?

40:58.290 --> 40:59.450
[KENZI] Sean.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.827
[INVESTOR] He ruined my life.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.870
You stupid shit.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.125
Are we even now?

41:09.718 --> 41:12.881
Sean. Oh my god, just
hold on. Hold on, okay?

41:12.971 --> 41:14.757
I told you so.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.634
No.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.431
No.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.111
[BO] How are you doing, Kenzi?

41:40.207 --> 41:43.665
Cool. Kind of restless, though.

41:43.752 --> 41:48.792
Maybe we can find some death metal
to just thrash out to or something.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.877
What's that?

42:03.021 --> 42:08.357
The lucky pig wins everything
except the wedding gifts.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.465
Bo didn't crumble. Even in the
face of death, she kept it together.

42:33.552 --> 42:36.134
Would you have killed her?

42:36.221 --> 42:38.712
Would you have used
your blood to save her?

42:41.059 --> 42:45.302
She's strong.
She deserves to know more.

42:45.397 --> 42:47.308
I'm not ready.

42:47.399 --> 42:50.311
[DYSON] She is.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.018
You've got to start
believing in her, Trick.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.523
She could amount to something.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.900
For her sake, I hope not.

42:56.992 --> 42:58.072
Those of us who rise to prominence

42:58.160 --> 43:01.744
tend to bring a great
deal of pain on ourselves.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.122
I know.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.710
To the Blood King.

43:12.257 --> 43:14.623
And all you've sacrificed.

43:16.428 --> 43:19.135
Please don't ever call me that.
