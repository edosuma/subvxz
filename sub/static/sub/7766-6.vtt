07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
Like, straight up.
- I don't know

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
how to stress
this enough to you.

07:56.999 --> 07:59.999
I'm grown.
I'm not picking sides.

07:59.999 --> 08:02.999
I trust Lala's judgment.

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
- You were kissing me
one second,

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
and you talked to Kristen,

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
and then five minutes later,
what happened?

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
- We're killing the vibe
right now. Let's just--

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- Fine.
Done.

08:10.999 --> 08:11.999
Done, can we just have fun?
- Yes.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.999
Let's make our way back
to what we--

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
what you said
we could do today.

08:16.999 --> 08:18.000
- Can you bite my tongue?
- Mm-mm.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.999
- Can I bite yours?
- No, you can't bite my tongue.

08:20.999 --> 08:22.999
Fááá that sháá.
That sounds like it hurts.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.999
- You can bite me as much
as you want, 'cause I like that.

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
- Do you?
- Yeah.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.999
- Do you want
me to draw blood?

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
- It's really weird, but I'm,
like, having an orgasm, right?

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
And you bite the back
of my fáááing arm,

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
I will fáááing go crazy.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
If you start nibbling, like,
right down here a little bit

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
and get harder and harder
to the top,

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
I'm probably gonna call
you the next day.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
How insane is that?
- It's weird.

08:40.999 --> 08:44.999
James is a kinky,
weird motherááááer.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
I don't think we're gonna
be sexually compatible.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
I'm a lover, not a biter.

08:48.999 --> 08:49.999
Last night
was intense for me.

08:49.999 --> 08:53.999
I'm not in any position
to be, like,

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
exclusively dating anybody.
- Yeah, me neither.

08:55.999 --> 08:58.999
I'm not also gonna be,
like, being fáááed around.

08:58.999 --> 09:00.999
Like, that's not what I'm doing.
- Wait, what do you mean?

09:00.999 --> 09:01.999
You're not gonna go,
and like,

09:01.999 --> 09:03.999
kick it with other people
and fááá other people?

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
Is that what you're--
- Would that hurt you if I did?

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- I mean,
I don't want to know about it.

09:07.999 --> 09:10.999
- Fine.
You do you, and I'll do me.

09:10.999 --> 09:13.999
- I have to lay out
boundaries for James,

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
because he is very aggressive.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.999
When I tell him
that I just want to have fun,

09:18.999 --> 09:20.999
it means fun, period.

09:20.999 --> 09:21.999
I'm gonna be honest.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.000
I'm, like,
really, really nervous.

09:23.999 --> 09:24.999
- You've got nothing
to be nervous about.

09:24.999 --> 09:25.999
There's no judgment.
It's just me and you right now.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.999
Okay?
- Okay.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
- All right. Cool.
So, I want you to say,

09:28.999 --> 09:32.000
"There ain't nobody that I'm
feeling like I'm feeling you."

09:32.999 --> 09:33.999
- "There ain't nobody
that I'm feeling

09:33.999 --> 09:34.999
like I'm feeling you?"
- Yeah.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
Ready?
Five, six, seven, eight--

09:36.999 --> 09:39.999

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
- Yeah, I like it.
I'm hyped.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.999
- Yo, we just made a fáááing
smash there, dude, real quick.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.999
You could say I was born
into the music industry.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
You know,
my dad managed Wham,

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
and George Michael actually
happens to be his cousin,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
and he's also my godfather.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.999
So, literally being born
into this musical industry,

10:36.999 --> 10:39.999
I've really been shown
how hard it is to make it.

10:39.999 --> 10:41.999
You need to have not only
the work ethic,

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
but you also
have to be talented.

10:43.999 --> 10:44.999
- All right, so, cool.

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
I'm hyped on it.
- Hey, I'm excited for tomorrow.

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
I want you to come see me
and we'll DJ.

10:48.999 --> 10:49.999
- Okay.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999
- Regardless, I'm gonna
make sure that I come see you.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.999
- I don't even know
what my plan is.

10:54.999 --> 10:55.999
- Are you okay with that?
I don't know where you're at.

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
I don't know where you're
at right now with me.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
- I don't either.
- I don't like that, Lala.

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
- Well, you just
got to go with it,

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
'cause it's just kind of
how I am, you know?

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
There's something
extremely sexy

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
about a talented guy.
It's just hot.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
If James
would just shut the fááá up

11:08.999 --> 11:09.999
and just speak
through his music,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.999
I think we could go somewhere.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
I may even consider
biting his arm.

11:14.999 --> 11:15.999
We had a
really good date today.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.999
You have to go.

11:17.999 --> 11:18.999
- Coming up...

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
- That's it.
Work it.

11:20.999 --> 11:21.999
Uh-oh.
- Ew, stop.

11:21.999 --> 11:24.999
- He's got
the mission--one hand.

11:24.999 --> 11:25.999
Man,
my ground's getting wet.

11:34.999 --> 11:37.999

11:37.999 --> 11:40.999

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
- What up, man?
- What's going on, man?

11:49.999 --> 11:50.999
- I went to college with Alfred.

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
I went to
Florida State with him.

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
- Oh, sweet.
- That's how we know each other.

11:53.999 --> 11:54.999
- And that's
how I know him as well.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
- Oh, cool.
- So...

11:56.999 --> 11:59.000
- This is kind of the man
of the hour.

11:59.999 --> 12:00.999
- Tell me what's up.
Tell me what's up.

12:00.999 --> 12:01.999
- I'm just trying
to get healthy, man.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.999
You know, lose weight,
get healthy again.

12:03.999 --> 12:06.999
- Basically,
we combine all these

12:06.999 --> 12:09.999
major art forms,
like acrobatics, dance,

12:09.999 --> 12:11.999
capoeira, martial arts,
kickboxing.

12:11.999 --> 12:15.999
- I feel like Shay
just needs a win. I don't know.

12:15.999 --> 12:20.999
I think he can benefit from
Afro-Brazilian dance fighting.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
- All right, let's do this.
Let's start. Come on.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
- Let's do it man.
- Down.

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
Back up.
- Oh, that's a good one.

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
- Down. Come back up.
Touch your abs. Touch.

12:27.999 --> 12:30.999
Down, up, down.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
Five--go.

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
Press, press, press.

12:34.999 --> 12:37.999
Push.

12:37.999 --> 12:39.999
Push it, Shay.
Push it.

12:39.999 --> 12:42.999
Lean back a little more
in your--in your hip.

12:42.999 --> 12:44.999
That's it. Good.
Breathe a little bit.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.999
- I am definitely
out of shape.

12:46.999 --> 12:47.999
- I mean, unfortunately,

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
you can't get back in shape
in one day.

12:49.999 --> 12:50.999
Trust me.
I've tried.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.999
- That's it.
Nice.

12:55.999 --> 12:57.999
That's it.
Good.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.999
- I lost it.
- Yeah, you were almost there.

12:59.999 --> 13:02.999
- I can't even lift my arms.
- Hit. Right cross. Hit. Hit.

13:02.999 --> 13:03.999
That's it.
Keep the gloves up.

13:03.999 --> 13:04.999
Hit.
One, two, three.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.999
One, two--
- Oh, sháá.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
- One--three, two--

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
- I guess.
I might throw up.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.999
- If you feel like
you're gonna throw up,

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
just hold your hand here.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
[retches]

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
[coughs]

13:21.999 --> 13:24.000
- I like that Shay's got
the fire in his belly, you know?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.999
I'm a little concerned that he's
puking it out at the moment,

13:26.999 --> 13:28.999
but I think he can get it back.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.999
- How you feeling, man?
- Good.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
- You guys ready to try
the next test?

13:31.999 --> 13:33.000
- Yeah, let's do it.
- You ready? All right.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.999
Imagine you're in the bed,
all right?

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
- If I imagine I'm in the bed,
I'll probably throw up.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
- No. You good. You good.
Just watch.

13:39.999 --> 13:40.999
Okay, I want you guys
to just go here...

13:40.999 --> 13:42.999
- Okay.
- And just move.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
And just see how long
you can last doing that.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
You guys ready?
Go.

13:46.999 --> 13:47.999
Nice and smooth.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
Give me a little more
snake, Tom.

13:49.999 --> 13:50.999
Give me a little more
snake, shorts. Let's go short.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
- I need somebody to make
eye contact with.

13:52.999 --> 13:53.999
Shorts,
give me some snake.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.999
Work it.
Uh-oh. Oh, look for it.

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
He's got the mission--
one hand.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
Man,
my ground's getting wet.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
Keep going.
Push.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- Oh, sháá, I busted.

14:03.999 --> 14:06.999
- He came already.
No. She's not ready.

14:06.999 --> 14:08.999
- Listen. Tom's only been
in a relationship for, like,

14:08.999 --> 14:11.999
a year, year and a half,
so, you know, give it

14:11.999 --> 14:14.999
a few more years, then we'll see
how fast you're grinding.

14:14.999 --> 14:15.999
- You got some
great friends, man.

14:15.999 --> 14:18.999
Your friends coming here,
supporting you, you know?

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
Helping you take
your health to the next level

14:21.999 --> 14:22.999
I think is really good.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.999
- When you stop working out,
the hardest day is the start.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
And that's why, like, dude,
we'll pick you up and go do it.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.999
This isn't just about
getting in shape.

14:30.999 --> 14:33.999
It's about feeling better
about your life.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
And I'm just hoping that Shay

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
is ready
to make that commitment.

14:37.999 --> 14:40.999
Hey, I was gonna ask you.
Is that ring almost done?

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
- Dude, next week.

14:42.999 --> 14:43.999
- Next week?
- Yeah.

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
The ring is gonna be
fáááing awesome.

14:45.999 --> 14:46.999
I'm getting a custom-made ring.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
- It's, like,
in the shape of, like, a tear.

14:48.999 --> 14:49.999
- A teardrop.
It's, like, sick.

14:49.999 --> 14:52.999
- Have you been thinking
of some clever ideas for--

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
- I think I'm gonna
keep it completely top secret,

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
even from you.
I'm sorry.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
- Think about possibly
sharing it with me.

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
- I'll think about it.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
I'm downright giddy
about the ring.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
I'm really excited
about picking it up, you know?

15:03.999 --> 15:06.999
But Shay's going through a lot
in his relationship right now,

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
so I'm trying to not bounce off
the walls, you know?

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
- How do you feel, man?
- Good.

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
- You think you're down to,
like, come back here?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
- Fááá, yeah.
- Do it?

15:14.999 --> 15:15.999
- Yeah, for sure.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.000
- How you been as far as, like,
drinking and stuff like that?

15:18.999 --> 15:21.999
- The drinking thing wasn't as
serious as, like, the pills.

15:21.999 --> 15:23.999
Like, I--I was
addicted to those.

15:39.999 --> 15:42.999
So, I recently got mar--

15:42.999 --> 15:43.999
well, not recently.
It's been almost a year,

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
but I haven't
changed my name yet.

15:45.999 --> 15:46.999
- Okay.

15:46.999 --> 15:47.999

a new picture?

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999

15:50.999 --> 15:51.999

and makeup done.

to give you a call.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999

- It shouldn't be long.

15:59.999 --> 16:00.999
- Awesome.

16:00.999 --> 16:03.999
The last few days
have been a lot better.

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
We're communicating.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.999

I've literally

16:06.999 --> 16:08.000
ever been with him.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
Scheana Marie Shay.

16:10.999 --> 16:12.999
I mean, Scheana Marie
was a cool name,

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
but Scheana Shay
is so much cooler.

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
- Okay, so now
we're gonna do the photo.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.999
- Okay.
I'm such a girl.

16:19.999 --> 16:20.999
- No, you look great.

16:20.999 --> 16:22.999
You just step back, right
behind the white line for me.

16:22.999 --> 16:23.999

16:23.999 --> 16:26.999

You're gonna stand straight.

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
- You're a cover girl.

16:35.999 --> 16:38.999
- You know, I'm not a big fan
of marriage for myself.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.000
My parents separated
when I was very little,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.999
got back together,
we had my brother,

16:42.999 --> 16:45.999
and then they kind of
just went their separate ways

16:45.999 --> 16:47.000
when I was in college,

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
but I don't think
there's really anything about

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
my upbringing
that would cause me

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
to believe what I believe
about marriage and kids,

16:54.999 --> 16:57.999
and I believe in
Scheana and Shay's marriage.

16:57.999 --> 16:58.999
- It's official.
- I now pronounce you

16:58.999 --> 17:01.999
Scheana Marie Shay.

17:01.999 --> 17:02.999
- Thank you, my darling.

17:02.999 --> 17:03.999
- [laughs]

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
- Dude, I know
you said you were kind of

17:05.999 --> 17:08.999
afraid to talk to Scheana
or to be expressive

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
about yourself.
Has it gotten better?

17:09.999 --> 17:10.999
Like,
as far as communication?

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
Do you feel comfortable
talking to Scheana now?

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
- I mean,
it'll definitely take time.

17:17.999 --> 17:20.999
Scheana's a very strong,
opinionated person,

17:20.999 --> 17:21.999
and in our relationship,

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
she definitely
has always kind of, like,

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
run the show
and likes to be in control.

17:25.999 --> 17:28.999
It's almost like I gave her
even more ammo

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
to, like, have
to run the relationship,

17:30.999 --> 17:32.999
because, you know,
I fáááed up.

17:32.999 --> 17:35.999
She listens,
and then, you know--

17:35.999 --> 17:36.999
but there's gonna
definitely be days

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
that maybe she doesn't and
I have to say something, so...

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
- Yeah.
- It sucks, because

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
she has something
to hold over my head now,

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
and I don't know when
that's ever gonna go away.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
The one thing
she has to work on, I think,

17:47.999 --> 17:50.999
is I have a conversation
with her, like this,

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
and then, like, no response,
and then I look over,

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
and she's just on her phone.
- It's like...[clicks]

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
- Those nails just clacking.
- And her nails, yeah.

17:56.999 --> 17:57.999
Her nails are just like...

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
And they're so fast.
both: Yeah.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.999
- So I kind of,
like, yelled at her,

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
and then she kind of
got upset,

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
but then I got to take
everything day by day right now.

18:04.999 --> 18:05.999
You know?
- Yeah.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
Shay's, like,
one of my only friends

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
in Los Angeles
that's married, so you know,

18:09.999 --> 18:11.999
I sort of look to him
to see

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
what it's gonna be
like, and right now,

18:13.999 --> 18:15.999
it's looking kind of scary.

anyone can have problems.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999

18:21.999 --> 18:24.999
- Scheana Shay!
- Yeah, I was gonna say.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
- It's official.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
- The official Scheana Shay.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
- I mean, I wouldn't have
thought after the last two weeks

18:30.999 --> 18:33.999
that I'd be this happy again.
- Yeah, you would.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- No, there were--there were--
- Well, maybe not--

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999

I'm like,

18:37.999 --> 18:40.999
"Are we gonna get a divorce?"
Like, I was miserable.

18:40.999 --> 18:42.999
- That's what
"for better or worse" is for.

18:42.999 --> 18:44.999

41:37.999 --> 41:38.999
- Do you like
how I invite myself

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
before you even invite me?
[laughs]

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- We're good. Let's go.
- All right.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
- Sorry, baby.

41:45.999 --> 41:47.000
Hi, babe!

41:47.000 --> 41:50.999
- Um, I guess
we'll see you at your house?

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
All right.
See you guys later.

41:51.999 --> 41:52.999
- Hey, you move fast.

41:52.999 --> 41:55.999
- Since James decided
to throw respect out the window,

41:55.999 --> 41:58.999
nothing is stopping me
from getting with Jax.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
Let's get it popping, Daddy.

42:00.999 --> 42:02.999
- Let's go.

42:02.999 --> 42:05.999
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

42:05.999 --> 42:06.999
Are you okay?

42:06.999 --> 42:08.999
- I mean,
it's a little weird for me.

42:08.999 --> 42:10.999
- Wait.
Is she going home with him?

42:10.999 --> 42:11.999
- What is going on?

42:11.999 --> 42:12.999
- We'll have a good time

42:12.999 --> 42:13.999
and here's the thing.
You have to understand,

42:14.000 --> 42:15.999
you're hanging out
with a 22-year-old

42:15.999 --> 42:17.999
who's gonna feed you
all kinds of sháá.

42:17.999 --> 42:18.999
- No, I'm over it.
- Come on.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
- That's clipped.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:25.999 --> 42:28.999
- I love being with you,
and I plan on

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
being with you
for a very, very long time.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't want to screw this up.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
- So are you allowed to,
like, still go

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
and have drinks with me?
- I can do that.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
- I'm not asking
to suck your dááá.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
I'm asking you to have a drink.
- Jesus Christ.

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
- Are you guys making,
like, a business plan?

42:40.999 --> 42:43.999
- I feel, at this point,
it would be non-beneficial.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.999
- What's up, Jason?
- Welcome to the office.

42:45.999 --> 42:46.999
- I'm not too rehearsed,
but I feel confident.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
I know what I'm talking about.
- I want to know what you guys

42:48.999 --> 42:51.999
have been doing the last week,
since we last met.

42:53.999 --> 42:54.999
- It's funny that you
step in on it

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
the second
I get done with her.

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
- I have a girl.
I'm good, dude.

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
- Do you?
Do you have a girl right now?

42:58.999 --> 43:00.000
- James has this ego
that needs

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
to be brought down
a few pegs.

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
- You've got nothing
going for you. You've got--

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
- So upset right now.
- You've got nothing but Jax.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
- James fixates on Jax.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
It is time for you to get
over this Jax thing.

43:09.999 --> 43:10.999
Fááá, you're psy--.

43:10.999 --> 43:12.999
You didn't just spit on my door.
- Yeah, bitch.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
- To see more of
"Vanderpump Rules,"

43:14.999 --> 43:15.999
