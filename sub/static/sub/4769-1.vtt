01:28.307 --> 01:29.363
Jeez!

02:11.515 --> 02:13.180
With the community still shaken

02:13.248 --> 02:16.180
from last year's
Slater's Quarry tragedy,

02:16.248 --> 02:18.364
here in Boreham,
it's fresh heartache.

02:18.431 --> 02:19.847
As the search for
the missing women

02:19.916 --> 02:22.264
moves into the end
of its second day,

02:22.333 --> 02:27.564
hope is fading for Senator Kaplan's niece,
Juno, and her 5 friends.

02:27.549 --> 02:30.396
Just behind me I can see
one of the cave rescue teams

02:30.464 --> 02:31.629
emerging from the caverns.

02:31.698 --> 02:32.964
Good luck, guys.
Thanks.

02:33.031 --> 02:34.413
Chimney's pretty tight.
You all be careful in there.

02:34.489 --> 02:35.601
Will do.
Sir,

02:35.668 --> 02:37.530
any signs of the missing women?

02:38.648 --> 02:41.131
Do you think you'll
find them alive?

02:41.198 --> 02:43.629
How does this compare to
Slater's Quarry?

02:45.748 --> 02:47.080
That's enough now.
Move back.

02:47.147 --> 02:49.263
Do you think you responded
quickly enough this time?

02:49.332 --> 02:51.196
Greg, leave it!
Greg!

02:54.098 --> 02:56.047
We're back on in 4 hours.

02:56.115 --> 02:59.213
Get some sleep.
You too, boss.

02:59.281 --> 03:01.548
Hey, you want to
share a sleeping bag?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.548
What's that cologne you're wearing?

03:03.615 --> 03:06.680
Yeah, 6 hours of sweat and dirt
and all other kinds of shit.

03:06.748 --> 03:08.046
I think I'll pass.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.730
Lynch? What's up?

03:13.731 --> 03:14.998
What?

03:16.731 --> 03:17.898
Where?

03:22.080 --> 03:24.463
Look, get a tracker dog
out there.

03:24.531 --> 03:26.580
See if you can find
where she came out.

03:27.414 --> 03:30.214
Yeah, all right, and....

03:30.282 --> 03:34.513
Let's keep the lid on this.
All right, I'm on my way to the hospital.

03:55.664 --> 03:56.780
Right, Doc, how is she?

03:56.848 --> 03:58.296
She's resting.

03:58.364 --> 03:59.963
We had to sedate her.

04:00.030 --> 04:01.647
I've got 5 girls missing

04:01.713 --> 04:03.446
and you put the one person
who knows where they are to sleep?

04:03.514 --> 04:06.380
She was hysterical.

04:06.448 --> 04:09.414
Besides, she has no memory
of the last 2 days.

04:09.481 --> 04:12.930
Whatever happened to her,
she's blanked it.

04:12.997 --> 04:14.043
Injuries?
Well,

04:14.101 --> 04:16.262
it's only some minor cuts and bruises.

04:16.329 --> 04:19.029
But her clothes were completely
stained in blood.

04:19.096 --> 04:20.646
So it's not her blood?

04:20.713 --> 04:21.946
No.

04:22.014 --> 04:23.579
But she's been in
a fight, all right,

04:23.647 --> 04:25.730
because judging
by her fingernails,

04:25.798 --> 04:28.847
she scratched some
big chunks out of somebody.

04:28.914 --> 04:30.480
Test her clothes,
get the blood type.

04:30.548 --> 04:31.879
Get the blood type of
the other 5 girls.

04:36.396 --> 04:39.079
All right, let's see
what you can do.

04:46.097 --> 04:47.646
Hello, Sarah.

04:52.113 --> 04:55.363
I'm Jenna Rios from Hyde County
Sheriff's Department.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.163
This is Sheriff Vaines.

05:02.931 --> 05:04.363
How you feeling?

05:05.198 --> 05:07.162
Where am I?

05:07.230 --> 05:10.582
You're safe.
You're at Hyde County hospital.

05:12.147 --> 05:15.096
We've been searching
for you and your friends.

05:15.414 --> 05:16.977
2 days ago

05:18.268 --> 05:20.363
you all set off on a caving expedition

05:20.431 --> 05:22.563
and you never came back.

05:23.463 --> 05:26.979
We've been following your
Boreham Cavern flight plan

05:27.047 --> 05:29.107
but we found nothing.

05:30.141 --> 05:32.149
Can you tell us what happened to you?

05:34.747 --> 05:38.212
I don't know.
I can't remember anything.

05:43.845 --> 05:48.212
Sarah, your friends
are still missing.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.029
We need you to
help us find them.

05:55.498 --> 05:57.162
Beth.

05:57.229 --> 05:58.320
Beth.

05:59.096 --> 06:00.962
What happened to Beth?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.694
What can you remember?

06:10.130 --> 06:11.746
What about Juno?

06:14.764 --> 06:16.078
Jessie.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.845
Where's Jessie?

06:18.914 --> 06:20.012
Your daughter?

06:24.313 --> 06:26.813
Sarah, Sarah,

06:28.347 --> 06:30.946
I need you to
listen to me carefully.

06:33.079 --> 06:35.496
Your daughter
isn't here, Sarah.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.794
She died.

06:38.863 --> 06:40.763
A year ago,
in Scotland.

06:40.829 --> 06:42.212
No.

06:43.763 --> 06:45.745
I know how hard
this must be for you,

06:45.813 --> 06:49.596
but you have to try...
No, no. No! No.

06:51.829 --> 06:52.978
Come on.

07:36.596 --> 07:39.095
This looks like the
end of the trail.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.360
What's that?

07:43.428 --> 07:44.694
That there's
Chapel Mine.

07:51.329 --> 07:53.460
Cuffs, come here,
come here.

07:55.129 --> 07:56.796
Go find them, boy.

08:07.813 --> 08:09.078
One of these days
I'm gonna come up here

08:09.145 --> 08:11.362
and help myself to
some of this shit.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.728
What you found, boy?
What you found?

08:25.778 --> 08:26.945
Cuffs?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.378
Holy shit!

08:53.861 --> 08:55.710
Sheriff.
Dan.

08:55.779 --> 08:57.910
Keep it under your hat,
but we found one of the girls.

08:57.978 --> 08:59.910
Dog picked up her scent
near the old Chapel Mine.

08:59.978 --> 09:02.110
That's the other side of the county.
I know.

09:02.861 --> 09:04.544
Jeez.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.478
Don't tell me we've been looking
in the wrong place.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.712
Listen, I don't want to shift
the whole goddamn circus.

09:08.779 --> 09:11.445
I just want a couple of volunteers
to pick up where the dog left off.

09:12.944 --> 09:15.043
All right, give us an hour.

09:18.512 --> 09:21.228
Cath, Greg, rise and shine.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.961
Blood on Sarah Carter's
clothes, A-positive.

09:24.579 --> 09:27.377
Juno Kaplan is A-positive.

09:27.444 --> 09:31.210
So? I'm A-positive.
Half the state is A-positive.

09:31.277 --> 09:32.427
Can she walk?

09:32.495 --> 09:33.627
Sure.

09:33.694 --> 09:35.244
Wait, wait, you're not seriously
gonna take her out...

09:35.312 --> 09:38.260
Rios, get her dressed
and get her in the car.

11:10.611 --> 11:12.943
My granddaddy used to work down there.

11:13.009 --> 11:14.576
One time, him and 2 of his buddies

11:14.644 --> 11:16.726
broke into a whole new cave system.

11:16.794 --> 11:19.594
Really big.

11:19.661 --> 11:23.343
Company bosses figured there
should be some rich pickings to be had,

11:23.411 --> 11:27.493
so they sent my granddaddy back down
to have a good look-see.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.525
He never come back.

11:30.761 --> 11:34.226
Folks reckoned they must've broke
clean through into hell.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.493
The devil was mighty pissed.

11:38.561 --> 11:42.776
So you're telling me that there's an
uncharted cave system down there?

11:44.394 --> 11:46.676
Cool.

11:46.744 --> 11:49.676
There's a map of
the mines here.

11:49.745 --> 11:52.794
If the caves are uncharted,
we won't even know where to begin.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.309
Bring the girl.

11:55.410 --> 11:59.493
Come on, Dan, she's the only
one been down there.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.660
All we gotta do is get a nod from her,
left or right.

12:01.727 --> 12:03.327
Narrows the search.

12:03.394 --> 12:05.926
There's a mountain full of caves
and fuck-all time.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.759
Could piggyback on
the elevator cables.

12:09.877 --> 12:13.093
You planning to go down there,
why not go down there in style?

12:13.077 --> 12:15.526
What, this old shit still works?

12:15.594 --> 12:17.293
Sonny, let me tell you,

12:17.360 --> 12:18.794
this old shit-bucket
will be working

12:18.861 --> 12:21.942
long time after
that MP3 of yours.

12:22.010 --> 12:23.492
Whatever.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.243
All right, Ed,

12:25.456 --> 12:26.702
get it going.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.592
I'm sorry, but Mommy's
got to help people tonight.

12:33.660 --> 12:38.022
Chica, when Grandma tells you to go to bed,
you go to bed, okay?

12:38.527 --> 12:42.175
Honey, I love you.

12:43.976 --> 12:46.626
Okay, baby, I'll see you
tomorrow, okay?

12:49.143 --> 12:53.009
Rios, get yourself kitted and
get her kitted. We're going down.

13:00.893 --> 13:04.659
Okay, Sarah, I know this is difficult,

13:04.726 --> 13:07.959
but if you do this,
it could help jog your memory.

13:09.393 --> 13:11.310
Your friends could still be alive.

13:11.378 --> 13:13.541
You have to help us find them.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.275
Hey, Sarah, this might fit you.

13:30.411 --> 13:32.942
You want to lose that heavy metal.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.492
Gun blast down
there'd be like dynamite.

13:35.559 --> 13:37.875
Come on, I'll put them in the car.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.892
My gun stays with me.

13:44.126 --> 13:46.110
This is a missing persons case.

13:46.177 --> 13:48.974
What the hell do you think
you're gonna find down there?

14:11.025 --> 14:12.192
<i>Mummy.</i>

14:13.092 --> 14:14.792
Right, let's get moving.

14:25.093 --> 14:26.825
Come on.

14:32.143 --> 14:33.375
You all ready to ride?

14:33.442 --> 14:34.975
Yeah, let's do it.

16:34.342 --> 16:35.507
Jesus.

16:47.724 --> 16:49.440
Hang on, just wait up a second.

16:57.008 --> 16:58.657
Here, drink this.

17:01.024 --> 17:04.058
She's okay.
Let me worry about her.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.340
Come on, Dan,
let's get to the goddamn cave.

17:10.590 --> 17:14.290
Listen. Down here,
I call the shots.

17:15.258 --> 17:16.991
Is that understood?

17:17.957 --> 17:19.490
Loud and clear.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.258
Let's go.

18:06.908 --> 18:09.222
Should be a ladder down there.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.840
How long have I
been teaching you?

18:16.024 --> 18:17.991
Your light is your life.

18:20.291 --> 18:21.407
Hey.

18:23.308 --> 18:26.574
All right. Okay, we've gotta go
down another level.

18:27.891 --> 18:28.939
Greg.

18:40.341 --> 18:42.706
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.457
Is it okay?

19:10.523 --> 19:13.722
You know what's good?
Modern mines have metal props.

19:15.091 --> 19:17.324
Miners prefer
these old wooden ones.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.205
Why's that?

19:19.273 --> 19:22.873
The metal ones don't give you any
warning when they're about to go.

19:30.924 --> 19:32.257
After you.

19:42.190 --> 19:45.023
Okay, we should hit the
cave system somewhere up here.

19:45.091 --> 19:47.124
Greg, go scout ahead.

19:47.191 --> 19:48.440
You got it.

19:50.624 --> 19:54.123
And Cath, you're next.
Deputy.

20:04.423 --> 20:06.390
I think I've found it.

20:10.241 --> 20:12.105
What the hell is that?

20:13.607 --> 20:15.239
It's a pit pony.

20:18.422 --> 20:20.156
Always a good sign.

20:38.873 --> 20:42.340
Check it out. This is awesome.

21:05.323 --> 21:07.521
Greg, T.I.

21:10.355 --> 21:13.505
Hey, hey. Don't...
Don't touch anything.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.305
This place is
thousands of years old.

21:17.923 --> 21:19.406
Well, you're hot.

21:19.786 --> 21:21.570
Get away.

21:21.639 --> 21:25.872
Sarah, do you
recognize anything?

21:48.406 --> 21:49.573
What?

22:27.772 --> 22:30.754
It's okay. It's okay,
she just got spooked.

22:41.372 --> 22:43.005
Calcium deposits.

22:45.673 --> 22:47.238
Let's keep moving.

22:47.307 --> 22:48.954
It's okay, come on.
Come on.

23:03.722 --> 23:04.754
Come on.

23:14.372 --> 23:15.521
Come on, Sheriff,
you can do it.

23:15.588 --> 23:17.371
I ain't that old yet.

23:24.989 --> 23:26.337
Which way?

23:29.171 --> 23:30.737
You recognize this?

23:33.906 --> 23:35.722
Cath, have a listen.

24:28.521 --> 24:29.737
Anything?

24:29.804 --> 24:32.554
I don't know.
I think I hear something.

25:12.221 --> 25:13.303
Jesus!

25:13.371 --> 25:15.404
My God!
Shit!

25:15.471 --> 25:17.720
Fuck! Sarah.
Look at me.

25:19.871 --> 25:21.086
She's moving.

25:21.154 --> 25:23.754
No. There's no body heat.
It's not possible.

25:37.188 --> 25:38.387
Deputy.

25:39.921 --> 25:41.320
Okay.
Sarah.

25:48.520 --> 25:51.804
She's been butchered.

25:51.871 --> 25:56.070
6 girls came down to this cave.
One came out.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.738
Covered in her friends' blood.

25:57.806 --> 26:01.036
Now, you tell me what the hell
happened down here.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.919
Wait a second. You think
she had something to do with this?

26:02.986 --> 26:04.653
This is fucked up!
Dan, get your team out of my face.

26:04.721 --> 26:06.220
Man, you brought her down...
Get off my back!

26:06.287 --> 26:07.953
Greg! Save it.

26:09.837 --> 26:11.720
I thought she was a victim here.

26:11.788 --> 26:13.870
What are you saying now,
she's a suspect?

26:13.938 --> 26:15.970
I think she knows something.

26:16.071 --> 26:18.386
I still got missing girls down here,

26:18.452 --> 26:20.386
so let's keep our goddamn focus.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.258
I should never have
let you bring her down here.

26:22.326 --> 26:24.886
Dan, I think she came through here.

26:24.954 --> 26:27.686
All right, Greg,
take point. Take point!

26:29.087 --> 26:30.836
This is fucking bullshit.

26:30.904 --> 26:32.221
Deputy, look after her.

26:32.372 --> 26:35.152
It's okay.
Come on, you're gonna be...

26:58.154 --> 27:00.670
Sarah, what is it?

27:05.687 --> 27:09.552
I think there's something down here.
We were attacked.

27:10.787 --> 27:12.585
By what?

27:12.653 --> 27:15.352
There's nothing down here that
could have done this to a person.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.703
Sarah, what can
you remember?

27:21.038 --> 27:22.253
Sarah?

27:23.737 --> 27:26.385
We shouldn't stay here.

27:26.452 --> 27:29.918
You've got to try and think rationally.
You're scared.

27:29.987 --> 27:32.919
Your mind's
playing tricks on you.

27:33.037 --> 27:34.652
<i>I'm through.</i>

27:34.720 --> 27:38.787
It's about a 50-foot crawl with some
tight spots, and then it opens out.

27:38.853 --> 27:42.570
All right, copy that.
Sheriff, get your team together.

27:42.638 --> 27:46.485
Greg, we're coming through.
Look out for them at the other end.

27:48.587 --> 27:50.836
Okay, Rios, you go first.

27:50.904 --> 27:52.485
I want you
in front of her.

27:52.552 --> 27:54.852
She's not getting out of my sight
from now on.

28:53.336 --> 28:55.968
Come on, you're
almost there. Come on.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.534
Hey! Whoa, come on.

28:59.603 --> 29:02.134
You need to breathe with me now.
You need to breathe, okay?

29:07.437 --> 29:09.936
Come on, keep it moving up there.

29:14.636 --> 29:17.402
Get a move on,
you're slowing down.

29:25.003 --> 29:27.418
Why have you stopped?
Get a move on!

29:30.318 --> 29:32.501
How are you feeling? All right?
Hey, hey, hey.

29:36.070 --> 29:37.169
Sarah... Sarah...

29:37.236 --> 29:38.468
Rios!

29:40.386 --> 29:41.519
Sarah!

29:42.269 --> 29:43.669
Sarah!

29:43.736 --> 29:44.985
For Christ's sake, Rios.

29:47.336 --> 29:49.868
Which way did she go?
Which way?

29:52.436 --> 29:54.568
Shit!
It's okay. It's okay.

30:10.602 --> 30:13.518
That lady's a fucking
psycho, Dan. Jesus.

30:14.954 --> 30:16.118
You okay?
I'm fine.

30:16.186 --> 30:18.252
Look at me. How's it feel?

30:18.320 --> 30:19.517
You want to kiss it better?

30:19.586 --> 30:20.616
He's fine.

30:20.685 --> 30:21.717
Where's Vaines?

30:21.785 --> 30:23.567
He took off after Sarah.

30:23.636 --> 30:25.601
Fuck! He doesn't
even have a radio.

30:27.485 --> 30:29.818
5 minutes in these honeycombs,
they'll both be lost.

30:29.885 --> 30:31.968
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me.

30:32.120 --> 30:34.201
We've gotta catch up on them
before they get too far ahead.

30:34.269 --> 30:37.950
This time, we stick together.
You understand? Okay, let's go.

30:38.717 --> 30:40.134
Yeah, come on.

31:18.536 --> 31:19.635
Okay.

31:21.102 --> 31:23.002
Okay, there's
falling rock here,

31:23.068 --> 31:26.151
which, as you know,
means the roof's unstable,

31:27.285 --> 31:30.267
so we have to
tread carefully. Rios?

31:30.335 --> 31:32.983
You stick with me, okay?
Let's go.

34:23.683 --> 34:26.348
Cath, can you hear me?

34:26.416 --> 34:28.415
Take it easy,
that's gotta last.

34:32.049 --> 34:33.547
Cath, come in.

34:34.416 --> 34:36.083
Cath, speak to me.

34:46.533 --> 34:48.081
<i>Dan, are you there?</i>

34:48.150 --> 34:49.415
I'm here, I'm here.

34:49.917 --> 34:53.599
I'm here. Are you hurt?

34:53.667 --> 34:55.264
I'm stuck in a boulder choke.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.348
And I need something
to support the rocks.

34:57.416 --> 35:00.066
All right, all right.
Don't you panic, don't you panic.

35:00.133 --> 35:03.199
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you. Okay?

35:03.267 --> 35:07.299
We'll work at this end, all right?
You listen to me.

35:07.367 --> 35:09.449
<i>You sit tight,
we'll get to you.</i>

35:11.017 --> 35:12.117
Okay.

35:14.585 --> 35:16.848
Jesus. Come here, come on.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.483
Come on.

35:20.801 --> 35:23.282
Come on, come on,
come on. Jesus!

35:24.433 --> 35:25.932
Dan.

35:27.617 --> 35:29.282
Come on. Come on!

35:31.900 --> 35:33.055
Fuck!

35:33.254 --> 35:35.398
Fucking trigger-happy Americans.
Dan.

35:35.466 --> 35:38.065
Fucking only answer they've got
to anything is a fucking gun!

35:38.133 --> 35:39.615
Dan, don't let her
hear you this way.

35:39.683 --> 35:40.949
There's a fucking ton
of rubble between us.

35:41.016 --> 35:43.015
She couldn't hear
a fucking rock concert.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.150
Dan.

35:53.399 --> 35:54.398
Okay.

36:04.334 --> 36:06.615
Okay. Okay, Cath.

36:08.067 --> 36:09.131
<i>Yes?</i>

36:12.399 --> 36:14.165
<i>We can't get through to you.</i>

36:14.232 --> 36:16.098
Well, can't you drill it or det it?

36:19.066 --> 36:22.782
You know we can't.
It's too risky.

36:22.850 --> 36:24.433
<i>You're gonna have to
work yourself free.</i>

36:24.500 --> 36:27.081
I can't, Dan, it'll crush me.
I need you here.

36:34.199 --> 36:37.281
Okay, I'm gonna find
another way around to you.

36:39.333 --> 36:40.648
Okay.

36:40.716 --> 36:41.632
I'll get to you.

36:44.915 --> 36:46.180
I'm scared, Dan.

36:47.749 --> 36:49.519
That's good, yeah?

36:49.707 --> 36:52.331
Fear keeps you alert,
it keeps you alive, it's...

36:55.449 --> 36:56.896
I promise you,

36:57.001 --> 36:59.386
<i>I won't stop till I get to you.</i>

36:59.966 --> 37:01.132
I know.

37:02.448 --> 37:05.448
Maybe I should stay with her.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.498
You know we can't help her here.

37:13.783 --> 37:15.148
You hang in there, teammate.

37:16.532 --> 37:18.181
No worries.

37:18.249 --> 37:19.498
Okay, Cath.

37:21.165 --> 37:22.231
Are you dry?

37:24.366 --> 37:25.548
Yeah.

37:25.616 --> 37:27.849
<i>So you'll keep warm.</i>

37:27.915 --> 37:29.605
<i>You keep drinking.</i>

37:30.228 --> 37:32.615
<i>You stick with the drill, okay?</i>

37:32.883 --> 37:34.882
Okay.

37:34.950 --> 37:37.314
<i>We're gonna have
to move off now.</i>

37:37.381 --> 37:39.398
<i>So you'll probably lose the signal.</i>

37:40.648 --> 37:42.314
<i>You stay positive.</i>

37:44.349 --> 37:45.615
Okay.

37:45.682 --> 37:46.998
<i>Okay.</i>

37:48.682 --> 37:53.480
<i>We're walking away.
You stay on channel 1.</i>

37:53.549 --> 37:56.063
Okay. I'll be on channel 1.

37:58.449 --> 37:59.981
You got your chance now.

39:36.599 --> 39:37.748
Shit!

39:41.047 --> 39:42.147
Fuck!

39:59.914 --> 40:01.330
What the fuck?

40:25.248 --> 40:26.680
Are these animal bones?

40:26.748 --> 40:27.880
Jesus.

40:45.531 --> 40:46.913
Dan! Dan!

41:06.248 --> 41:08.297
Here we are, morning
after the night before.

41:08.447 --> 41:11.213
<i>Here we go. Look at this face.
Yeah.</i>

41:11.280 --> 41:12.863
Wake up, ladies.

41:12.930 --> 41:15.297
I feel like a pig.

41:15.365 --> 41:17.297
Now there's some water.
It's not nice.

41:17.365 --> 41:19.031
We all ready for this big,
exciting day?

41:19.098 --> 41:20.663
Yeah.

41:20.731 --> 41:22.445
That's Juno.

41:24.513 --> 41:28.179
I'll believe that when I see it, all right?

41:28.248 --> 41:29.347
<i>How you doing?</i>

41:29.414 --> 41:30.446
Yeah, I feel good.

41:30.515 --> 41:31.546
Good.

41:34.981 --> 41:36.980
<i>Recording for...
For National Geographic!</i>

41:37.048 --> 41:38.714
<i>For National Geographic.</i>

41:38.782 --> 41:39.812
<i>Once again...</i>

41:39.881 --> 41:40.912
<i>Recording our trip...</i>

41:41.085 --> 41:42.895
To Boreham boredom Cavern.

41:42.963 --> 41:44.312
How do you think Sarah's doing?

41:44.380 --> 41:45.329
Do you think she's ready for this?

41:45.398 --> 41:47.880
I mean, she just seemed a little bit...

41:49.048 --> 41:50.862
You cut the camera?

41:54.765 --> 41:56.879
Sarah?

41:56.947 --> 41:58.845
Put it away for, like, 2 minutes!

41:59.963 --> 42:02.696
Where is that?
I don't know.

42:02.764 --> 42:04.813
<i>Holly! Could you take a break?</i>

42:04.881 --> 42:06.612
<i>I just want to
take a few more shots.</i>

42:06.680 --> 42:08.880
<i>This cave's a lot
cooler than I thought.</i>

42:08.948 --> 42:10.147
This wasn't in the book.

42:10.364 --> 42:11.746
Good.

42:11.814 --> 42:13.679
Maybe that last jelly custard
wasn't a really good idea.

42:15.579 --> 42:17.878
How much further, do you think?

42:17.946 --> 42:19.378
Thank you very much.

42:19.447 --> 42:21.496
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

42:22.831 --> 42:24.063
Okay, guys?

42:29.513 --> 42:31.230
Do you hear that?

42:35.679 --> 42:37.046
Is that it?

42:39.930 --> 42:43.012
Dead animals, hundreds of them.

42:43.081 --> 42:44.546
That's here.
This is not good, guys.

42:44.614 --> 42:48.463
Can we get out of here?
Which way? That's this place.

42:48.530 --> 42:50.479
<i>Come on. I don't know.</i>

42:50.547 --> 42:52.529
<i>What do you mean you don't know?</i>

42:52.597 --> 42:54.945
<i>There's no breeze! It could be any
one of these tunnels! Take your pick!</i>

42:56.429 --> 42:57.612
Fuck it!

42:57.679 --> 42:59.846
Hello!
Please!

42:59.914 --> 43:02.128
Is there anybody there?

43:03.130 --> 43:04.412
Hello?

43:05.580 --> 43:07.361
What the fuck is that?

43:13.662 --> 43:16.095
Greg! Greg!

43:22.980 --> 43:25.012
<i>Greg! Greg, where are you?</i>

44:08.696 --> 44:09.761
Dan!

44:11.045 --> 44:12.395
Rios, you there?

44:12.462 --> 44:15.645
Dan, I'm here!
Where are you?

44:18.962 --> 44:20.978
Dan! Where are you?

44:26.663 --> 44:27.727
Dan!

44:47.763 --> 44:49.028
Rios!

44:51.578 --> 44:52.710
Rios!

44:57.779 --> 45:01.145
Rios! Where are you?
Let me know where you are!

45:01.212 --> 45:02.927
I can't hear you!

45:05.379 --> 45:06.696
Sarah.

45:59.129 --> 46:00.810
You let him die.

46:13.578 --> 46:16.177
What the fuck
was that thing?

46:16.246 --> 46:17.503
Don't worry.

46:17.621 --> 46:19.711
It's just your mind
playing tricks on you.

47:26.445 --> 47:28.760
Dan? Greg?

47:34.278 --> 47:35.960
Dan, is that you?

47:38.611 --> 47:40.494
Can you hear me, Dan?

49:36.894 --> 49:38.341
Sarah.

49:40.227 --> 49:41.426
I...

49:43.644 --> 49:45.126
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

49:45.194 --> 49:47.823
They're blind.
They track sound.

49:47.932 --> 49:49.188
You're louder.

50:55.060 --> 50:56.908
Greg! Greg!
Cath!

51:04.693 --> 51:06.491
Where's everyone else?

51:07.476 --> 51:09.434
We got split up.

51:10.226 --> 51:11.209
What the fuck
are these things?

51:11.276 --> 51:12.358
I don't know.
I don't know.

51:12.476 --> 51:13.857
I want my fucking torch.

51:13.925 --> 51:15.325
Shit. Sorry. Here.

51:19.275 --> 51:22.759
Is this okay?
Okay? Okay. All right.

51:27.809 --> 51:29.908
Run. Run! Run!

52:11.959 --> 52:13.125
Jesus!

52:15.143 --> 52:16.207
Dan!

52:21.710 --> 52:23.423
Jesus Christ, Dan.

52:34.775 --> 52:37.558
Fuck. Fuck!

53:23.442 --> 53:24.841
<i>Are you there?</i>

53:25.409 --> 53:27.641
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

53:27.709 --> 53:30.125
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody out there?

53:30.191 --> 53:31.458
<i>Come in! Anybody?</i>

53:31.526 --> 53:32.758
Up! Up!

53:33.091 --> 53:34.257
Up!

53:40.824 --> 53:42.307
Dan's dead.

53:42.375 --> 53:43.691
Turn it off.
Turn it off!

53:44.508 --> 53:46.174
<i>Come in. Anybody?</i>

53:52.775 --> 53:55.073
<i>Are you there?
Can you hear me?</i>

53:56.625 --> 53:58.674
<i>Come on, can you pick this up?
Can you hear me?</i>

54:06.375 --> 54:08.540
Dan? Dan, come in.

54:08.608 --> 54:10.556
Dan, it's Cath. Come in.

54:11.291 --> 54:12.358
Dan's dead.

54:12.525 --> 54:13.924
Dan. Come in, Dan.

54:15.825 --> 54:17.357
Vaines had his radio, Cath.

54:17.425 --> 54:19.525
We don't know that.
We... He wasn't clear.

54:19.591 --> 54:21.074
Dan? Dan, come in. Dan?

54:21.142 --> 54:23.274
Give me that. Give me.

54:25.207 --> 54:27.857
I left him there.

54:27.923 --> 54:30.423
Those... Those fucking things
attacked us and I left him there.

54:30.441 --> 54:32.690
No. No, he promised he'd come back.
He promised he'd come back.

54:32.758 --> 54:34.790
I heard him scream, Cath.

54:36.858 --> 54:38.590
I heard him scream.

54:40.991 --> 54:42.956
He's gone, Cath, okay?

54:45.274 --> 54:47.289
No. No.

54:53.058 --> 54:55.257
I ain't gonna run out on you.

54:58.391 --> 55:01.189
You even try, and I'll kill you myself.

55:04.591 --> 55:07.290
We gotta move.
Stay quiet. Come on.

55:21.940 --> 55:23.190
Jesus.

55:27.123 --> 55:28.740
Fuck.
Fuck.

55:30.358 --> 55:31.457
Fuck!

55:32.674 --> 55:35.339
You'll have to jump.
It's too far.

55:38.725 --> 55:40.589
Use her to get across.

55:45.690 --> 55:47.006
Go.

55:47.074 --> 55:48.640
Fuck!
We have no choice.

55:48.708 --> 55:50.291
Fuck! Fuck!

55:51.057 --> 55:51.956
Go!

55:58.458 --> 56:00.222
All right, push forward!

57:33.289 --> 57:34.694
Greg!

57:35.074 --> 57:37.072
Greg!

57:41.957 --> 57:43.239
Greg!

58:27.424 --> 58:30.071
Got washed out by
the water last time.

58:31.139 --> 58:35.105
I... I can't go
down there.

58:35.173 --> 58:38.155
The water's flowing.
There's a way through.

58:42.123 --> 58:45.872
No, no. Wait. Wait, please.
Wait. Please. Wait!

01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:26.471
Sarah. Sarah.
Sarah! Sarah!

01:00:30.606 --> 01:00:31.737
God.

01:00:33.071 --> 01:00:36.054
No, no, no. Sarah!

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:44.371
Come. Come.

01:00:44.438 --> 01:00:46.072
All right.

01:00:59.506 --> 01:01:00.737
It stops here?

01:01:00.772 --> 01:01:03.587
It's a dead-end.
There's no way through?

01:01:04.522 --> 01:01:05.953
No.

01:01:06.022 --> 01:01:07.071
Fuck!

01:01:12.154 --> 01:01:13.654
Fucking water.

01:02:00.588 --> 01:02:02.304
Hi, baby girl.

01:02:03.638 --> 01:02:06.370
Hiya. It's Mommy.

01:02:10.571 --> 01:02:13.203
I... I just wanted
to let you know...

01:02:15.704 --> 01:02:17.302
That I love you.

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.870
I want you to be good.

01:02:24.837 --> 01:02:26.104
And kind.

01:02:27.605 --> 01:02:28.969
And caring.

01:02:30.805 --> 01:02:33.054
I want you to
be a good person.

01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:38.870
You're so special, baby.

01:02:42.688 --> 01:02:46.521
Te quiero, te extrano, baby.

01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:55.602
My daughter's dead.

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.103
I know.

01:03:04.688 --> 01:03:07.193
Everything you just said,
you tell it to her face.

01:03:07.292 --> 01:03:08.953
We're not dead yet.

01:03:10.522 --> 01:03:12.586
Come on.
We'll keep moving.

01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:42.935
Juno!

01:04:46.353 --> 01:04:49.169
Juno, I'm here to help you.

01:04:50.504 --> 01:04:53.086
Get you out. You hear me?

01:04:54.604 --> 01:04:56.368
I'm here with Sarah.

01:08:14.452 --> 01:08:15.734
Sarah!

01:09:45.584 --> 01:09:46.818
God.

01:09:47.818 --> 01:09:49.849
What the fuck
is this?

01:09:51.384 --> 01:09:52.983
I don't know.

01:10:20.702 --> 01:10:23.150
Now I wish I was
back in the water.

01:11:59.617 --> 01:12:01.549
What are these things?

01:12:03.735 --> 01:12:04.900
Death.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.015
Your friends,
they're all dead?

01:12:27.332 --> 01:12:28.432
Yeah.

01:12:33.834 --> 01:12:36.016
How the fuck did you
find this hellhole?

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:39.549
Juno brought us here.
She wanted us all to discover it.

01:12:41.849 --> 01:12:44.582
She said she wanted
to name it after me.

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:46.814
Why?

01:12:46.883 --> 01:12:48.149
Guilt.

01:12:50.483 --> 01:12:53.081
What happened
between the 2 of you?

01:12:53.983 --> 01:12:56.266
My husband.

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:58.765
She had an affair
with my husband.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:01.365
What happened to her?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.632
It was just
Juno and me left.

01:13:10.383 --> 01:13:13.049
Those things
were coming for us,

01:13:13.116 --> 01:13:15.549
so I hurt her so
I could get away.

01:13:18.316 --> 01:13:20.481
She left my friend
Beth dying.

01:13:22.449 --> 01:13:23.698
Alone.

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:28.632
When I found Beth,
I had to put her out of her misery.

01:13:36.531 --> 01:13:38.132
Save your torch.

01:14:34.283 --> 01:14:36.748
No, Juno, wait! Wait!

01:14:36.816 --> 01:14:39.599
We came to get you out!
Juno.

01:14:39.665 --> 01:14:43.498
Sarah brought us back down here.
She brought us back.

01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:46.330
Juno. Sarah is your friend.

01:14:59.099 --> 01:15:01.198
So you're the rescue party?

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.730
We're what's left.

01:15:04.165 --> 01:15:06.164
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

01:15:06.182 --> 01:15:07.364
Okay, listen to me.

01:15:07.432 --> 01:15:11.115
Listen. Those things hunt
above ground.

01:15:11.182 --> 01:15:13.432
I think I know which way they go.

01:15:13.499 --> 01:15:15.165
They must have
a route to the surface.

01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:16.631
So, let's go.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.863
Wait a minute, so what?
We go to where they feed?

01:15:21.181 --> 01:15:22.448
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:15:22.515 --> 01:15:25.997
Do you want to live?
Silence is your best weapon.

01:15:26.815 --> 01:15:27.814
Follow me.

01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:29.381
We're following the water.

01:15:29.449 --> 01:15:31.965
I ain't going in no goddamn water.
Juno knows the way out.

01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:33.798
So how come you're still here?

01:15:33.866 --> 01:15:37.730
Because my light died,
I had no equipment,

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.331
and my climbing
partner put a pick

01:15:39.399 --> 01:15:41.147
through my leg
and ran out on me...

01:15:41.215 --> 01:15:43.747
There isn't time
for this, God damn it!

01:15:43.814 --> 01:15:46.281
We want to get out of here alive,
we follow Juno.

01:15:46.348 --> 01:15:48.414
No fucking way.

01:15:48.182 --> 01:15:52.331
God damn it! I brought you
into this hellhole, I'm taking you out.

01:15:53.748 --> 01:15:56.314
Wait!
What? It's no good.

01:15:56.382 --> 01:15:58.097
Chief!
Shut up, Rios.

01:16:01.148 --> 01:16:02.631
Let's move.

01:16:24.865 --> 01:16:26.164
Come on.

01:16:44.964 --> 01:16:46.162
It's...

01:16:48.931 --> 01:16:51.214
We'll have to
go single file.

01:17:08.948 --> 01:17:10.681
Spread your weight.

01:17:24.914 --> 01:17:26.445
Keep it steady.

01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:35.614
Easy, easy.

01:17:39.264 --> 01:17:41.495
We really should do
this one at a time.

01:17:41.564 --> 01:17:44.663
You ran out on her,
but you ain't running out on me,

01:17:44.731 --> 01:17:46.463
so let's get going.

01:18:13.313 --> 01:18:14.412
Shit!

01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:33.613
Help me!

01:18:34.764 --> 01:18:35.813
Give me the bag.

01:18:39.547 --> 01:18:41.879
Juno, help me, please!
Juno!

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:55.696
My arm! Pull me up!

01:19:00.447 --> 01:19:01.846
Grab my pick.

01:19:04.247 --> 01:19:05.578
Okay. Okay.

01:19:05.646 --> 01:19:08.596
Cut.
What? Cut what?

01:19:08.664 --> 01:19:10.545
Cut it, or they'll both die!

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:12.479
Just fucking cut it!

01:19:16.947 --> 01:19:17.896
Do it now!

01:19:18.047 --> 01:19:19.679
Wait! Wait!

01:19:37.697 --> 01:19:38.813
Hurry!

01:19:52.846 --> 01:19:53.979
Hurry!

01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.213
Fuck. Okay.

01:20:12.281 --> 01:20:13.713
We gotta move.

01:20:23.029 --> 01:20:24.511
We gotta go.

01:20:28.363 --> 01:20:29.629
Rios.

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:34.445
Sarah.

01:20:36.763 --> 01:20:38.111
Let's go.

01:23:59.028 --> 01:24:00.759
Come on. Come on!

01:25:05.895 --> 01:25:07.127
I can't...

01:25:07.178 --> 01:25:08.227
No.

01:25:13.011 --> 01:25:14.677
I'm so sorry.

01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:19.492
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

01:25:20.261 --> 01:25:21.593
It's okay.

01:25:35.978 --> 01:25:37.310
Sarah.

01:25:40.243 --> 01:25:42.377
Sarah, we can't stay here.

01:25:47.456 --> 01:25:51.075
Sarah. We have to
get out of here now.

01:26:02.311 --> 01:26:03.709
Sarah.

01:26:04.927 --> 01:26:06.276
Please.
