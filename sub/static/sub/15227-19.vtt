01:16.409 --> 01:19.944
(humming lively tune)

01:19.979 --> 01:21.980
ELAINE:
             Whoa, whoa, are you
                in good spirits.

01:22.014 --> 01:23.080
Whoo.

01:23.115 --> 01:24.616
What'd you do
today, Louie?

01:24.650 --> 01:27.318
You kick some squirrels
into the lake?

01:27.353 --> 01:29.287
Better than
                   that, Reiger.

01:29.321 --> 01:31.890
I just came from
               a class with Judy

01:31.924 --> 01:33.625
at the School
                  for the Blind.

01:33.659 --> 01:35.694
She's been trying
  to get me to go for months.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.962
If I knew it was gonna be
          so much fun,

01:37.996 --> 01:39.463
I'd have gone a long time ago.

01:39.498 --> 01:40.999
What a girl!

01:41.033 --> 01:42.000
What a day!

01:42.034 --> 01:43.401
Ah!

01:43.435 --> 01:45.870
Hey, Lou, what kind of, what
   kind of things they teach you

01:45.905 --> 01:47.338
at this, uh, School
                  for the Blind?

01:47.372 --> 01:50.242
Oh, it's, it's a class
       for sighted people

01:50.276 --> 01:52.710
to-to-to show them
  what it's like to be blind.

01:52.744 --> 01:54.912
I mean, we all put on blindfolds

01:54.947 --> 01:57.448
and we try to use
    our other senses to see.

01:57.483 --> 01:59.284
I-I was the best in the class.

01:59.318 --> 02:00.184
They loved me there.

02:00.219 --> 02:01.186
Here, I'll show you.

02:01.220 --> 02:02.687
Now watch this.

02:02.721 --> 02:05.957
Now, all right, one of you,

02:05.991 --> 02:08.425
any one of you,
      step right up here.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.627
Just come on right up.

02:11.129 --> 02:13.698
LOUIE:
                      Come on...

02:13.732 --> 02:15.867
Ah...

02:15.901 --> 02:18.136
Aha!

02:18.170 --> 02:22.440
I heard the faint
             squeak of a sneaker

02:22.474 --> 02:24.675
and I detect

02:24.710 --> 02:30.882
the not-so-faint smell
        of mostaccioli.

02:30.916 --> 02:32.550
So, it must be Banta.

02:32.584 --> 02:33.818
Hey.
                    Is it Banta?

02:33.852 --> 02:35.486
Yeah.
                       Hey!

02:35.520 --> 02:37.755
All right, come on,
                  somebody else.
         Come on, right up here.

02:37.789 --> 02:39.156
Come on, anybody,
                        anybody.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.162
Ah, all right.

02:45.197 --> 02:46.864
(sniffing)

02:46.898 --> 02:51.569
Now, my ears and my nose don't
 seem to be enough in this case.

02:55.841 --> 03:00.979
So, step closer,
        O, Unknown One,

03:01.013 --> 03:06.518
and allow me to identify you
    with my sense of touch.

03:06.552 --> 03:10.055
I think he knows it's me.

03:10.089 --> 03:10.922
Was it Nardo?

03:10.956 --> 03:12.923
Surprise, surprise.

03:12.958 --> 03:14.658
Oh, mercy.

03:14.693 --> 03:16.961
We narrowly escaped
       an embarrassment.

03:16.996 --> 03:18.730
(cackling)

03:18.764 --> 03:21.132
I-I-I'm going next.

03:23.869 --> 03:26.905
Sit down, Iggy.

03:26.939 --> 03:28.306
Amazing.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.945
That must be a trick blindfold.

03:33.979 --> 03:36.514
Huh?
No, Jim, Jim, no.

03:36.548 --> 03:38.883
Nothing that I did here
couldn't be done

03:38.917 --> 03:43.888
without using senses other
than the sense of sight.

03:43.922 --> 03:45.290
Ah.

03:45.324 --> 03:48.159
This, however, would
be more difficult.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.096
"Weather report.

03:52.131 --> 03:55.266
Fog turning
   to hazy sunshine."

03:55.300 --> 03:56.367
(cackling)

03:56.402 --> 03:59.704
If that's not a
                trick blindfold,

03:59.738 --> 04:02.107
that's got to be
              a trick newspaper.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.509
Of course it's
a trick blindfold!

04:04.543 --> 04:05.476
It's a trick!

04:05.511 --> 04:07.178
(cackling)

04:07.212 --> 04:11.316
Five bucks in a magic shop
and I was the star of the class.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.618
Louie, Louie,
      I can't believe it.

04:13.652 --> 04:15.520
I mean, you actually
        went to a class

04:15.554 --> 04:17.322
that's supposed to be teaching
      you the sensitivity

04:17.356 --> 04:20.024
to the plight of the blind
and you did something like that

04:20.058 --> 04:21.591
just to look good?

04:21.627 --> 04:23.427
I mean, how could you do that?

04:23.462 --> 04:25.796
Pride, Reiger. Pride.

04:25.831 --> 04:28.399
You should have
              seen Judy gushing.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.801
She was... warm.

04:30.836 --> 04:33.170
She was, like, bright.
         She loved it.

04:33.205 --> 04:35.139
How could you be so
insensitive to her?

04:35.174 --> 04:36.908
Insensitive?
    Yeah.

04:36.942 --> 04:39.210
If I'm so insensitive...

04:39.244 --> 04:41.946
why would I have
        bought her this?

04:41.980 --> 04:44.348
Ooh, a diamond ring?
          Yeah, yeah.

04:44.383 --> 04:45.816
Ooh.
         That's right.

04:45.851 --> 04:49.687
A half a carat
     of girl's best friend.

04:49.721 --> 04:52.023
I'm gonna ask her
          to marry me.

04:52.057 --> 04:53.491
No.

04:53.525 --> 04:56.994
You're shocked at the idea of me
  settling down, huh, Reiger?

04:57.028 --> 05:01.432
No, I'm appalled at the
   prospect of you breeding.

05:03.068 --> 05:07.038
Lighten up, Reiger,
          I'm in love.

05:07.072 --> 05:10.541
And if she says yes,

05:10.576 --> 05:13.111
I'll cherish her for
      the rest of my life.

05:17.683 --> 05:19.817
I believe you, Louie.

05:19.852 --> 05:21.853
Yeah, so do I.

05:21.887 --> 05:24.222
Yeah, Lou, I do.

05:24.256 --> 05:26.791
Yeah, I guess
      I believe you, Lou.

05:28.427 --> 05:30.061
Let me see.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.196
Yeah, look at that.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.830
(imitating Humphrey Bogart):
Guess who, sweetheart?

06:14.173 --> 06:16.508
You are a great kisser.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.946
Now, quick, get out of here
          before Louie shows up.

06:21.981 --> 06:23.781
(laughing)

06:27.052 --> 06:28.118
Shut the door, Louie.

06:28.153 --> 06:29.454
All right.

06:29.488 --> 06:34.425
All right, okay, now,
come right over here,

06:34.460 --> 06:37.862
'cause I brought
you something.

06:37.896 --> 06:38.829
(sniffs)

06:38.863 --> 06:40.064
A rose?

06:40.099 --> 06:41.733
Ooh, she's good.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.300
Here, you can take it.

06:43.335 --> 06:45.303
I had it de-thorned.

06:45.337 --> 06:46.537
Thank you.

06:46.571 --> 06:49.373
And a bottle of champagne.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.842
Ooh.

06:50.876 --> 06:52.777
This is the really
good stuff.

06:52.811 --> 06:54.812
You know what they say
about champagne--

06:54.847 --> 06:58.950
the better the bottle, the
louder the pop, so stand back.

06:58.984 --> 07:02.153
When I uncork this baby,
it's gonna explode.

07:03.488 --> 07:05.422
(cork clatters)

07:08.460 --> 07:12.362
(makes a pop)
   There she blows!

07:12.397 --> 07:13.765
Oh! Oh!

07:13.799 --> 07:15.233
There's foam all
over the ceiling.

07:15.267 --> 07:17.502
(laughing)
Now give me a rag.

07:17.536 --> 07:20.170
I'll get the glasses.

07:20.205 --> 07:22.173
Oh, boy. Oh...

07:22.207 --> 07:23.507
Here you go, Louie.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.209
Uh-huh.

07:25.243 --> 07:29.146
You know, you usually
            don't come over here
           with all these gifts.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.415
What's the occasion?

07:31.449 --> 07:34.085
Well...

07:34.119 --> 07:37.689
a <i>big</i> surprise.

07:37.723 --> 07:42.192
Well, uh, I've got a big
          surprise for you, too.

07:42.227 --> 07:44.061
Well, you go first.

07:44.095 --> 07:45.263
No, you go first.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.499
We'll settle this fair,
the way we always do.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.134
Okay.
    All right?

07:50.168 --> 07:53.470
Evens you go first,
odds I go first, all right?

07:53.505 --> 07:55.606
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three, shoot.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.875
It's evens. You go first.

07:57.909 --> 08:00.345
Okay.

08:00.379 --> 08:04.281
Well, I didn't want to tell you
 this until I was sure about it.

08:04.315 --> 08:08.285
Louie, I may be
              able to see again.

08:10.555 --> 08:11.589
What?

08:11.624 --> 08:13.424
Isn't that fantastic?

08:13.459 --> 08:15.393
My doctor says there's
           been some improvement

08:15.427 --> 08:17.895
in the surgical technique
  and he wants to operate again.

08:17.929 --> 08:19.297
He thinks that, this time,

08:19.331 --> 08:21.365
there's a real good chance
           that it will succeed.

08:21.399 --> 08:25.135
When's he-- when's
      he want to operate?

08:25.170 --> 08:26.870
Tomorrow.

08:26.905 --> 08:30.440
With any luck at
               all, in 24 hours,

08:30.475 --> 08:34.544
I'll be able to see
     your sweet, beautiful face.

08:36.248 --> 08:38.549
Isn't that wonderful?

08:38.582 --> 08:39.883
Yeah.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.552
Isn't that the best
         news you've ever heard?

08:41.586 --> 08:45.389
I haven't been able to think
    about anything else all day.

08:45.423 --> 08:46.490
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:46.525 --> 08:47.691
I almost forgot.

08:47.726 --> 08:51.128
What was the surprise
                 you had for me?

08:51.162 --> 08:53.364
Well, uh...

08:53.398 --> 08:58.569
Well, now that you've...
you've told me that,

08:58.603 --> 09:01.038
it-it-it hardly seems like
the time to, uh...

09:02.674 --> 09:05.042
Oh, come on, Louie.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.911
Let me be the judge of that.

09:08.781 --> 09:12.450
Well, uh,

09:12.484 --> 09:16.387
I bought something
today that...

09:16.421 --> 09:22.860
would've never occurred
to me before I met you.

09:22.894 --> 09:25.162
Well, what is it, Louie?

09:28.533 --> 09:30.768
Foot deodorant.

09:30.802 --> 09:32.770
(laughing)

09:32.804 --> 09:36.807
Oh, Louie, you always
      know how to make me laugh.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.459
Hey, Lou, how'd
the, uh, proposal go?

09:55.493 --> 09:58.062
(mutters)

09:58.096 --> 10:02.099
Uh, as a man of the cloth,

10:02.134 --> 10:05.603
I would be honored to perform
the marriage ceremony.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.409
I'd rather have
                 a baboon do it.

10:11.443 --> 10:15.279
I don't blame you.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.015
I've seen that.

10:18.049 --> 10:20.618
It's lovely.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.455
Louie, what happened?

10:25.490 --> 10:27.992
Look, it's none
       of your business.

10:28.026 --> 10:30.361
If you guys are smart,
 you'll just stay away from me.

10:34.632 --> 10:36.300
Yay!

10:36.335 --> 10:41.339
Louie, I'm so happy that you
 and Judy are getting married.

10:41.373 --> 10:45.076
Oh, this is a time
      of great happiness--

10:47.712 --> 10:51.315
...and joy.

10:51.349 --> 10:53.450
Well, go ahead, Latka,
               don't be chicken.

10:53.485 --> 10:54.552
All right.

10:54.586 --> 10:56.153
Chicken.

10:57.622 --> 10:59.457
Okay, Louie, we brought you

10:59.491 --> 11:01.692
some of the traditional
                engagement gifts

11:01.727 --> 11:02.826
from our country.

11:02.861 --> 11:04.461
Yeah.

11:04.495 --> 11:08.298
First is... a piece of candy
     to make the marriage sweet.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.233
Ooh.

11:13.838 --> 11:19.743
All right, uh, next is a flower
     because love is so fragile.

11:19.778 --> 11:20.745
Yeah.

11:20.779 --> 11:23.914
(loud bang)

11:25.784 --> 11:27.551
That was a big hit.

11:32.724 --> 11:36.059
All right, come on,
     let's get out of here.

11:36.094 --> 11:38.028
Banta, 411.

11:38.063 --> 11:40.865
Thompson, 426.

11:40.899 --> 11:42.400
Iggy, 301.

11:42.434 --> 11:45.436
Nardo, 218.

11:45.470 --> 11:46.971
Hill, 802.

11:47.005 --> 11:49.072
Lupus, 567.

11:51.543 --> 11:53.477
Hey, Louie, you
              forgot to call me.

11:53.511 --> 11:55.746
I didn't forget, Reiger.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.515
I want to talk to you.

11:57.549 --> 11:59.717
Oh, I was afraid of that.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.653
Look, Louie, whatever happened
 last night, whatever happened--

12:02.687 --> 12:04.889
whether you got cold feet,
            whether she said no,

12:04.923 --> 12:07.358
look, it's happened to millions
  of guys before you, all right?

12:07.392 --> 12:09.626
Now, if you want to talk
      about this later on, okay,

12:09.661 --> 12:11.261
but listen,
         I got to make a living,

12:11.295 --> 12:12.563
so I'd like
              a cab now, please.

12:12.597 --> 12:14.565
Yeah, here, 618.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.966
Okay, thanks.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.069
Judy had an
                operation today.

12:19.103 --> 12:20.704
She may be able
                   to see again.

12:23.341 --> 12:26.144
That got your interest,
           didn't it?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.379
I'm supposed to be over there
           right now.

12:28.413 --> 12:31.715
They're taking the bandages off
        at this moment.

12:31.749 --> 12:33.317
She wants <i>me,</i>

12:33.352 --> 12:39.556
the man she loves, to be
the first person that she sees.

12:39.591 --> 12:42.726
Life stinks, huh, Reiger?

12:42.760 --> 12:45.596
She told me
about it last night.

12:45.630 --> 12:48.398
After that, I mean,
     I didn't see any point

12:48.433 --> 12:50.333
in asking her to marry me.

12:50.368 --> 12:52.369
Wait a minute.
              What is it, Louie?

12:52.403 --> 12:54.505
You're afraid she's not
          gonna like your looks?

12:54.539 --> 12:56.473
No, my tie, Reiger.

12:56.508 --> 12:59.776
I'm afraid she won't like
the way I knot it.

12:59.811 --> 13:00.978
Do you love her?

13:03.781 --> 13:04.816
More than anything.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.217
Well, if she loves you,

13:06.251 --> 13:08.352
then that operation isn't
           gonna change a thing.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.687
It's gonna change everything!

13:10.721 --> 13:14.225
You know, Louie, you are really
       much too insecure

13:14.259 --> 13:15.426
about your appearance.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.762
I mean, you're a...

13:18.797 --> 13:22.332
interesting-looking guy.

13:22.367 --> 13:27.238
I mean, uh, you, uh,
           in your better moods,

13:27.272 --> 13:31.108
you-you-you've
              a somewhat puckish
              quality, you know?

13:31.143 --> 13:34.578
I mean, some people might
         even think you're cute.

13:36.915 --> 13:39.483
Let's not talk hypothetical
here, Reiger.

13:39.518 --> 13:40.818
You think I'm cute?

13:40.852 --> 13:42.553
It's a matter
                  of taste, Lou.

13:42.587 --> 13:45.790
It's, uh, some people like
       Golden Retrievers, right?

13:45.824 --> 13:48.692
And some people like,
                  uh, pit bulls.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.061
But I'm sure
                  the people who
            like pit bulls think

13:51.096 --> 13:52.196
that pit bulls are cute.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.632
Cute? They're adorable!

13:54.666 --> 13:56.100
Well, my work is done here.

13:56.134 --> 13:57.334
I think I'm needed elsewhere.

13:57.368 --> 13:59.369
No, no, no, no, you're not done
          yet, Batman.

13:59.404 --> 14:00.671
What do you
                   want from me?

14:00.706 --> 14:02.039
I'm not going to that hospital.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.374
You're comparing me to a pet!

14:03.408 --> 14:05.175
A lot of people
  like grotesque pets.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.278
Some people keep tarantulas.

14:07.312 --> 14:09.346
That doesn't mean
 they're gonna marry one.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.014
Lou, do you know how
 ridiculous you sound right now?

14:11.049 --> 14:12.082
Oh, sure, sure,

14:12.116 --> 14:14.117
it sounds ridiculous
to you, Reiger,

14:14.152 --> 14:18.155
because you've
never gotten that look.

14:18.189 --> 14:19.190
What look?

14:23.528 --> 14:25.662
The look I got
       on blind dates...

14:25.697 --> 14:30.401
when I used to go
        on blind dates.

14:30.435 --> 14:32.836
I got the same one
      every time, Reiger.

14:32.871 --> 14:36.807
Walk up there,
       dressed real nice,

14:36.841 --> 14:39.876
carrying a present
        or some flowers.

14:39.911 --> 14:41.011
You know, get ready...

14:41.046 --> 14:45.449
strike a pose,
     so I'll look my best.

14:45.483 --> 14:48.419
And then the door would open,

14:48.453 --> 14:52.256
and there'd be a girl there
  and she'd give me that look.

14:55.693 --> 14:58.862
I got it every time, Reiger.

14:58.897 --> 15:03.968
Sure, oh, sometimes they'd show
a little class, you know?

15:04.002 --> 15:06.169
They went out
with me anyway.

15:06.204 --> 15:07.571
But most of the time

15:07.605 --> 15:12.443
they came up with these
brilliant excuses like,

15:12.477 --> 15:15.313
"Oh, you must be here
           for Wanda.

15:15.347 --> 15:16.947
Well, she's sick."

15:16.982 --> 15:21.318
This, coming from a girl with a
"W" embroidered on her sweater.

15:22.987 --> 15:25.222
I got that look
every time, Reiger.

15:25.256 --> 15:30.260
And today,
when they, when they take

15:30.294 --> 15:31.995
those bandages off
of Judy,

15:32.029 --> 15:34.331
it's gonna be like
that door opening again.

15:34.365 --> 15:37.501
I'm gonna get that look
from somebody

15:37.535 --> 15:40.204
I already love.
         I ca...

15:42.173 --> 15:46.710
Hey, look, Louie...

15:46.744 --> 15:49.513
I can't tell you
             what's gonna happen

15:49.547 --> 15:51.382
when they take
                the bandages off

15:51.416 --> 15:54.985
and she's able to see you,
        but, uh, I do know this:

15:55.019 --> 15:57.655
if you don't go there

15:57.689 --> 15:59.656
and see for yourself,

15:59.690 --> 16:01.292
you're never gonna
               forgive yourself.

16:06.865 --> 16:11.368
Yeah... yeah, I guess
     you're right, Reiger.

16:11.402 --> 16:13.904
But... I...

16:13.939 --> 16:16.974
I don't know, I wish that I,
    I wish I had more hair.

16:17.008 --> 16:19.777
I wish I had dimples, you know?

16:19.811 --> 16:20.944
I wish, I wish...

16:20.979 --> 16:24.180
I wish, I wish I was, uh...

16:24.215 --> 16:26.817
What, Louie?

16:26.851 --> 16:28.952
Taller?

16:31.589 --> 16:33.590
Louie, you've been
                having a romance

16:33.624 --> 16:35.159
with this girl
                     for months.

16:35.193 --> 16:37.861
I think she knows
                    your height!

16:37.896 --> 16:40.230
You're right, Reiger.

16:40.265 --> 16:45.469
Sure... she knows it...

16:45.503 --> 16:47.538
but...

16:47.572 --> 16:49.573
she's never
seen it, Reiger.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.415
I'll go with you.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.376
Excuse me, is one,
              is one of you, uh,
                 Louie De Palma?

17:25.410 --> 17:26.410
Yeah, I'm Louie.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.244
Hello.
              I'm Judy's doctor.

17:28.279 --> 17:30.447
The operation went
        very well, Mr. De Palma.

17:30.482 --> 17:34.485
I'm gonna be removing
            Judy's bandages now.

17:37.188 --> 17:39.423
You?

17:39.457 --> 17:42.626
Uh, well, look, if it's any
   trouble, I could do that.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.494
No trouble.

17:50.535 --> 17:51.835
Louie...

17:51.869 --> 17:53.403
Reiger, Reiger...

17:53.437 --> 17:55.472
I think you'd better go
in there right now.

17:55.506 --> 17:56.640
Come on.

17:56.675 --> 17:59.710
Yeah, you're right,
         you're right.

18:01.312 --> 18:03.079
You know...

18:07.485 --> 18:11.689
Even if it means
      getting that look...

18:11.723 --> 18:13.424
I hope the operation worked.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.259
Me, too. Good luck.

18:15.293 --> 18:17.861
Yeah.
     I'm gonna go in there.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.671
This is me.

18:27.705 --> 18:30.740
This is my body.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.109
This is my face.

18:32.143 --> 18:35.579
If she loves me,
       she'll love this.

18:35.613 --> 18:37.548
ALEX:
                          Right.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.920
You got a tweezer, Reiger?

18:42.954 --> 18:43.954
Tweezer?
                       What for?

18:43.988 --> 18:45.122
I want to pluck my eyebrows.

18:45.156 --> 18:46.690
Oh, what?

18:46.725 --> 18:48.525
No, just the hair right
             in the middle here.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.526
Louie, come on.

18:49.560 --> 18:50.794
You don't need it!

18:50.829 --> 18:52.696
Well, it couldn't hurt.

18:54.799 --> 18:57.067
(grunts)

18:57.101 --> 18:59.069
Ah!

19:09.381 --> 19:11.581
Louie, is that you?

19:11.615 --> 19:13.783
Yeah.

19:13.818 --> 19:15.919
Oh, thank goodness
           you got here in time.

19:15.953 --> 19:18.489
I want your face
                 to be the first
                    thing I see.

19:18.523 --> 19:20.190
Come hold my hand.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.130
Your palms are so sweaty.

19:27.165 --> 19:29.299
You're as nervous
                        as I am.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.300
Yeah.

19:30.334 --> 19:34.004
Oh... Louie,

19:34.038 --> 19:37.107
what if I still can't see?

19:42.046 --> 19:43.580
You'll still have me.

19:44.949 --> 19:46.283
All right now, Judy,

19:46.317 --> 19:48.652
I'm going to take off
  the last of those bandages.

19:48.686 --> 19:49.853
Wait, wait! Don't!

19:49.888 --> 19:51.822
I'm scared!

19:51.856 --> 19:55.559
I'm afraid
   to find out if it worked.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.528
Yeah, Doc,
what's the rush?

19:57.562 --> 20:00.630
I mean, give her
a couple of months
to figure this out,

20:00.665 --> 20:01.898
to get used to it.

20:01.932 --> 20:04.702
Oh, Louie, I'm so glad
          you're here.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.903
You're right,
       I'm acting silly.

20:06.937 --> 20:09.573
Go ahead, Dr. Gordon,
         take them off.

20:09.607 --> 20:11.508
Wait, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

20:32.063 --> 20:36.199
Judy...

20:36.234 --> 20:39.569
I'm not the best-looking guy
         in the world.

20:39.604 --> 20:40.837
Go ahead, Doc.

20:43.274 --> 20:44.708
Now remember,

20:44.742 --> 20:53.584
it's gonna be just
 a little bit blurry at first.

20:53.618 --> 20:55.919
So don't be afraid.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.261
I can see!

21:05.296 --> 21:07.130
It's blurry, but I can see.

21:07.165 --> 21:08.399
It's okay.
Just take a minute.

21:08.433 --> 21:12.335
Oh! Oh, Louie, you're beautiful!

21:12.370 --> 21:13.937
It's still blurry.

21:16.674 --> 21:21.111
No, you're exactly the way
        I pictured you.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.346
I am?

21:23.380 --> 21:25.348
Yes, yes, yes!

21:25.383 --> 21:28.419
I can see! I can see!

21:28.453 --> 21:30.487
And...

21:30.522 --> 21:33.624
I'm, I'm exactly the way
you pictured me?

21:36.127 --> 21:37.594
Yes!

21:37.629 --> 21:41.765
Except I thought
      you had a little more hair

21:41.800 --> 21:44.401
between your eyebrows.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.939
It grows back!

21:53.844 --> 21:56.446
Ha-ha! Yippee!

21:56.481 --> 21:57.814
Ya-ha-ha-ha!

21:57.849 --> 22:00.117
I take it
   you didn't get that look?

22:00.151 --> 22:02.186
No, Reiger, Reiger,
                    she can see,

22:02.220 --> 22:03.654
and she loves me!

22:03.688 --> 22:04.988
She thinks I'm
              beautiful, Reiger!

22:05.022 --> 22:07.591
And now she's resting,
        so I gotta go buy suits.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.493
What is that,
hospital policy?

22:09.527 --> 22:11.528
No, no, no, Reiger.
           Everything's changed.

22:11.563 --> 22:12.929
I got to adapt.

22:12.964 --> 22:16.133
I mean, no more bragging
  about my extensive wardrobe

22:16.167 --> 22:18.001
when I only own one suit.

22:18.035 --> 22:19.335
Uh-huh.

22:19.370 --> 22:22.506
From now on,
I got to buy her greeting cards

22:22.540 --> 22:23.640
that fit the occasion.

22:23.674 --> 22:27.210
Reiger, it's a brave new world!

22:27.244 --> 22:29.947
Reiger!
                         Reiger!
All right, all right,
all right!

22:29.981 --> 22:31.849
Let's go get
you those suits!

22:31.883 --> 22:33.250
Oh, one more thing...

22:33.284 --> 22:34.484
What?

22:34.518 --> 22:36.887
I'm gonna have to buy her
                 a real diamond.

22:52.803 --> 22:56.440
(theme song playing)

23:17.294 --> 23:18.895
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:18.929 --> 23:20.097
