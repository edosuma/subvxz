00:01.960 --> 00:03.360
You ever
thought about gear?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.480
It's too hard to bring in.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.880
Not LSD.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.960
Shit.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.280
<i>You say you went on a bender</i>
<i>with your friends</i>

00:11.320 --> 00:13.080
and missed curfew.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.800
You didn't see me, and you
know nothing about any of this.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.920
[Allie]<i> I just saw Marie</i>
<i>in the visitors' centre.</i>

00:16.960 --> 00:19.000
She's got this creep
to do something to Ruby,

00:19.040 --> 00:20.480
and now he's here,
reporting back to her.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.400
-Where's Ruby?
-I don't know.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.080
Please don't do it! No! No!

00:25.120 --> 00:26.080
Where is she?

00:26.120 --> 00:27.360
I don't know!

00:28.360 --> 00:31.040
-Allie, no, please!
-Ruby's OK.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.960
Marie's been telling
the truth.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.360
[officer]
<i>Heard of rendition?</i>

00:34.400 --> 00:35.640
We can take you offshore,

00:35.680 --> 00:37.400
basically do whatever
we want with you.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.880
We have the power to hold you,
indefinitely.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.000
[theme music playing]

01:26.120 --> 01:27.920
[gate opens]

01:27.960 --> 01:29.600
-What's going on?
-Move.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.040
Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.560
Jump scare.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.400
You'll have
to try a little harder.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.040
You're being extradited
to the States.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.400
I just heard from
the Attorney General's office.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.280
The U.S. are initiating
proceedings against you.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.080
Enjoy the view.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.440
Where you're going, there
won't be much natural light.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.760
-I want to call my Dad.
-Not happening.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.520
Get up.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.640
Not until I can make
a phone call.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.480
On your feet. Now.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.600
-Don't push me, Bryant!
-Or what?

02:32.640 --> 02:33.960
You'll get the pepper spray?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.040
-[woman] Show off!
-Go on, do it.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.320
Give me something
to take to my lawyer.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.680
Grab her.

02:39.720 --> 02:42.640
I'm formally requesting
a phone call.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.200
I want
to talk to my father.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.400
Shut the fuck up.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.880
My circumstances
have changed,

02:46.920 --> 02:49.000
and I demand a review
of my privileges!

02:49.040 --> 02:50.640
[woman] Cunts! Let her go!

02:50.680 --> 02:52.440
This is a violation
of my rights!

02:52.480 --> 02:54.720
I want a meeting with my lawyer
and a phone call.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.480
Hey, what's going on?

02:57.440 --> 02:59.560
Ask Judy Assange.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.360
The U.S. wants
to extradite me.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.480
Shit.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.680
Shit.
What does that mean?

03:04.720 --> 03:06.800
It means throwing me
in a hellhole in the States.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.760
I gotta talk to my Dad,
or I'm fucked.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.080
Can you get a phone?

03:12.120 --> 03:13.800
Lou's got a burner, yeah?

03:15.080 --> 03:16.600
Good luck getting that.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.320
Hey. We're gonna
sort something out, OK?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.360
[Boomer]
Yeah. Yeah.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.640
[woman on PA]
<i>Attention all staff,</i>

03:26.680 --> 03:29.000
<i>the van will arrive</i>
<i>in ten minutes.</i>

03:29.040 --> 03:30.240
How're we gonna sort it?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.120
We could try Reb.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.480
If you want a phone,
what about the call centre?

04:09.520 --> 04:13.240
Here, where's my red carpet,
ya bitches?

04:13.280 --> 04:14.440
Come here!

04:16.440 --> 04:18.120
Oh, I missed you!

04:18.960 --> 04:20.560
What the hell happened?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.680
I just got on the piss
with some mates.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.360
Missed my curfew.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.120
-Missed it!
-I know, right?

04:27.160 --> 04:29.360
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:29.400 --> 04:30.840
What?

04:32.520 --> 04:35.320
I'm sorry for causing you
any grief, Allie. I...

04:40.080 --> 04:41.360
What's her problem?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.680
Oh, mate.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.640
Hey, I'm really sorry.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.160
You're sorry?

05:05.280 --> 05:06.440
Don't be mad at me.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.040
I thought you were dead!

05:16.080 --> 05:18.280
I thought Marie
had you killed.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.480
I was this close
to cutting her throat!

05:21.520 --> 05:22.880
-Jesus...
-And why?

05:22.920 --> 05:24.960
Because you
got on the fucking piss?

05:30.400 --> 05:31.640
Get out.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.760
The time frame
for the extradition

05:42.800 --> 05:44.360
is yet to be confirmed.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.760
Having spoken to Mr. Jackson,
I'd like to remind you all

05:47.800 --> 05:50.920
that Bryant's privileges
remain fully suspended.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.320
That means no visitors,

05:52.360 --> 05:54.800
apart from her lawyer,
and no phone calls.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.160
Any questions?

05:57.160 --> 05:58.720
Good.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.480
Dr. Miller, you have
an update on Joan Ferguson.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.000
Yes. I've been assessing
Ferguson over the past week.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.600
I maintain
that she's suffering

06:05.640 --> 06:09.200
from a severe
dissociative fugue state.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.600
Yeah, amnesia?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.080
Yes.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.240
But apart from that,
she's mentally sound.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.560
Well, generally, yes.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.880
Then I see no good reason

06:17.920 --> 06:19.520
why she can't be
returned to General.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.840
-No way.
-Ann, you can't be serious.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.360
The last time Ferguson
was out there,

06:25.400 --> 06:26.480
the women hanged her
from a basketball ring.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.120
You heard Greg.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.040
There's no justification
to keep her in Psych.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.640
[Dr. Miller] That doesn't
mean she's ready to go back--

06:31.680 --> 06:33.000
And I will not have Psych

06:33.040 --> 06:34.680
turned into a pseudo
Protection Unit.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.120
Ann, she's too fragile.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.640
We'll be exposing her
to hostility

06:37.680 --> 06:39.160
that she doesn't
even comprehend.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.640
We don't have the budget
for special treatment

06:40.680 --> 06:41.880
for prisoners like--

06:41.920 --> 06:43.720
Ferguson is
not going into General.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.200
End of discussion.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.960
Shall we continue
this elsewhere, Mr. Jackson?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.320
If you release her, you will
have a death on your hands.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.720
Not if everyone
does their job properly.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.760
I have compromised
enough over this.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.240
Ferguson is a psychopath.
Miller has no idea--

06:59.280 --> 07:01.000
For God's sake,
she has amnesia.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.560
So that's it?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.400
Our experience counts
for absolutely nothing.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.760
Of course it does, Will--

07:05.800 --> 07:07.280
Yeah, but that
decision's been made.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.920
-Right. I quit.
-Will--

07:14.960 --> 07:17.960
No, Ferguson shouldn't
even be in Wentworth.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.400
If you won't listen to reason,
I can't work with you.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.400
Maybe that's for the best.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.200
If he walks, you will lose
half the senior staff

07:30.240 --> 07:31.480
by the end of the week.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.320
-Vera, you're exaggerating--
-Ann!

07:33.360 --> 07:34.960
Listen to me.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.760
The staff have
a history with him,

07:36.800 --> 07:39.080
and they will follow him.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.360
Including you?

07:44.280 --> 07:45.480
Yes.

Ms. Bennett?

08:06.480 --> 08:07.920
I really have
to speak to my Dad.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.360
I cannot help you
this time, Bryant.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.040
No, please, I'm begging you.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.640
I am sorry, the answer is no.

08:12.680 --> 08:15.360
Promising news, hey?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.640
The amnesia?

08:18.280 --> 08:21.520
I can almost forgive Greg
being tricked by her,

08:21.560 --> 08:23.360
but you of all people--

08:23.400 --> 08:25.520
He's a shrink. He knows
what he's talking about.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.480
Jesus, Jake.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.360

09:01.600 --> 09:05.520
Is this pretence really
worth getting torn apart?

09:05.560 --> 09:09.480
Because I guarantee
the women will not be sucked in.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.520
And I'm not gonna
save you this time.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.320
Admit you're a psychopath.
We can keep you in here.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.480
Are you saying...
Have they attacked me before?

09:24.520 --> 09:27.600
[soft chuckle]

09:27.640 --> 09:30.320
Oh, cut the crap.
No one's looking.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.440
You might have convinced
Dr. Miller...

09:43.360 --> 09:47.120
but don't think for a second

09:47.160 --> 09:50.000
that I am buying your act.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.800
I'm sorry, I...

09:55.040 --> 09:57.720
I don't... I...

09:57.760 --> 09:59.360
-I'm not...
-Yeah?

10:04.600 --> 10:05.840
Fine.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.600
Have it your way.

You sound surprised,

-Wait.

Hey, be careful.
Don't hold 'em for too long.

I don't have one.

love to give you one.

This is Susan calling
from Maynard Market Research.

Thanks.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.040
Yeah, I'm conducting

12:39.080 --> 12:41.680
some exciting research
on chocolate,

12:41.720 --> 12:43.640
and I was wondering if you
could spare a few minutes

13:27.840 --> 13:29.200
Sit down, Novak.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.040
[Allie] I can't work
if my headset's not working.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.800
Well, I don't know,
it's broken.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.520
-Come on, come on, come on.
-I gotta go to the dunny.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.240
Like really, really, badly,
eh. It's coming out!

13:37.280 --> 13:38.880
-It's coming out!
-Bryant!

13:38.920 --> 13:41.040
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Dad, Dad, it's me, Judy.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.560
Come on Ms. Miles,
she's not hurting anyone.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.560
-Move!
-Come on!

13:44.600 --> 13:46.720
-I mean it, Jenkins.
-Dad, Dad, don't hang up.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.240
She needs two minutes
just to talk to her Dad--

13:48.280 --> 13:51.120
-Come on--
-What the fuck!

13:51.160 --> 13:53.080
[man]<i> I've got people with me.</i>
<i>I'm in a meeting.</i>

13:53.120 --> 13:54.920
Dad, don't hang up.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.320
-Dad, they want to extradite me.
-<i> Judy, now's not the time.</i>

14:00.440 --> 14:02.240
Get up.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.920
You need to do something.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.440
The supervising officer
has been dismissed.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.640
You sacked the wrong one!

14:14.680 --> 14:16.760
You know Bryant
has no phone access.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.240
That doesn't mean that you
can hit people with a baton.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.520
Hey, Ms. Miles has been given
an official warning.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.760
Fuck!

14:24.440 --> 14:26.600
You might be thankful
for tougher security.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.440
Ferguson is
moving into General.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.120
I'm really sorry, Allie,

14:38.160 --> 14:40.640
but I'll make sure we have
eyes on her at all times.

14:45.320 --> 14:49.080
You moved me out of the laundry
so she'd go interstate.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.040
Apparently, Ferguson is
suffering

14:51.080 --> 14:52.720
from severe memory loss,

14:52.760 --> 14:54.800
-if that's any consolation.
-How could you let this happen?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.520
I know this must
feel like a betrayal,

14:56.560 --> 14:58.320
but it is out of my hands.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.320
Which is why I've resigned.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.000
Who's taking over from you?
Linda and her baton?

15:21.040 --> 15:24.640
-I'm not sure.
-You're a fucking coward!

15:24.680 --> 15:27.000
Must be really nice,
being able to just walk away.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.160
What happens if I stand down?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.920
Leave the women to Lou Kelly?

15:30.960 --> 15:32.120
To the Freak?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.640
You're lucky you've
got choices, Mr. Jackson.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.760
This is so shit.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.800
Oh, whoa.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.000
I was so close.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.800
Just ten seconds
more would...

16:01.840 --> 16:03.840
I can't believe
we missed frigging lunch.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.720
I can't believe
you got fucking hit.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.080
I'm gonna help you
make a formal complaint.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.600
If we do nothing, then
we're saying her cruelty's OK.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.560
Oh, well,
tough titties, yeah?

16:16.680 --> 16:19.720
Hey, you deserve
better than this, Boomer.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.360
Yeah, you do.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.800
You might not think so,
but we do.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.480
Hey.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.320
What happened with Mr. J?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.960
The Freak
is coming to General.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.240
[Boomer] What?

16:36.000 --> 16:38.320
Wait, I thought
she was being transferred.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.480
So did I.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.080
Shit.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.200
-It's gonna be OK.
-Yeah.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.440
I'm not gonna
let her hurt anyone.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.640
Promise.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.520
Yeah, we know.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.120
Yeah, give us two.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.120
-Here.
-Cheers.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.720
Think of it as day release
for your mind.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.200
You get all that freedom

17:07.240 --> 17:08.800
without finding out
your piece-of-shit boyfriend

17:08.840 --> 17:10.200
fucked your best mate.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.480
She's not even trying
to hide it, eh?

17:30.720 --> 17:32.720
Lou just slipped
Linda a note.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.320
So she is lagging.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.000
What the fuck
is wrong with her?

17:37.040 --> 17:38.720
Why go to the trouble
of leaving notes

17:38.760 --> 17:40.640
when she could talk
to her somewhere in private?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.400
Why would Lou Kelly
do anything?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.280
Thanks for the info
on Bryant.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.000
Under no circumstances
can she use a phone.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.240
Righto.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.480
Have you got any history
with Joan Ferguson?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.360
Uh...

18:15.400 --> 18:18.600
I mean, I know that she's
the pin-up for crazy.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.320
No, I got, I got
transferred

18:22.360 --> 18:23.840
straight after
she became Governor.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.080
She's being released
back into General.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.680
-I want you to protect her.
-No.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.960
Looking after Winter's
one thing. Ferguson?

18:35.040 --> 18:36.360
I don't want her
anyone near Reb.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.960
She won't be any trouble.
She's got amnesia.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.840
Are you shitting me?

18:44.440 --> 18:46.160
Fuck me.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.400
So we got a deal?

18:56.560 --> 18:58.680
It's totally up to you.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.360
I suppose it gets down to how
much Reb wants that top surgery.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.560
Jesus.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.080
-Pull it over!
-Hey.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.920
-Where is it?
-How'd you go?

19:16.960 --> 19:19.800
Good. Just a bit
more babysitting.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.160
[laughter and chatter]

19:25.240 --> 19:27.040
Trippin' off their tits.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.000
Ferguson?

19:46.640 --> 19:47.800
The Freak!

19:47.840 --> 19:49.840
-Freak!
-What the fuck, Ferguson!

19:49.880 --> 19:51.240
[woman] Is that the Freak?

19:52.240 --> 19:53.400
It's OK.

19:53.440 --> 19:58.400
[laughter and chatter]

19:58.440 --> 20:00.560
The Freak!

20:08.120 --> 20:09.480
[woman] String her up!

20:09.520 --> 20:10.960
Fucking Freak!

20:12.760 --> 20:15.000
-Freak! Freak! Freak!
-Freak! Freak! Freak!

20:15.040 --> 20:17.400
-Freak! Freak! Freak!
-Freak! Freak! Freak!

20:20.160 --> 20:21.680
Settle down!

20:21.720 --> 20:24.280
-Freak! Freak! Freak!
-Settle down!

20:24.320 --> 20:26.240
Or you're off to the slot!

20:26.280 --> 20:27.480
Freak! Freak! Freak!

20:30.800 --> 20:32.480
It's OK, Kath.
Just keep moving, yeah?

20:39.320 --> 20:40.560
G'day, Joan.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.960
I'm Lou.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.920
What the fuck is she doing?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.320
-What the fuck, Lou?
-You're kidding me!

20:52.360 --> 20:55.080
Fucking shut up!

21:12.800 --> 21:14.800
Now you're in me
and Reb's unit.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.240
Come on.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.920
All right, all right,
back up.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.560
That's enough. Back up.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.040
-Get the Freak!
-That's enough!

21:29.080 --> 21:30.920
-Settle down!
-Freak!

21:30.960 --> 21:33.240
-Piece of shit!
-Settle!

21:43.560 --> 21:45.080
is there something you want?

21:46.040 --> 21:47.400
Yeah, for you not to be here,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.360
but I don't really have
a say in that.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.000
It's my job to protect you
from those fuckers.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.040
And I'm actually quite good

21:59.080 --> 22:02.840
at whatever I put my hand to,
so lucky you.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.560
However...

22:06.600 --> 22:10.840
if you try any of
your psycho shit, Joanie...

22:12.200 --> 22:14.040
I will throw you to the pack.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.400
And if you so much

22:19.440 --> 22:22.400
as look at Reb the wrong way,

22:22.440 --> 22:26.120
I will pull
your throat out myself.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.200
Are we clear?

22:31.160 --> 22:32.320
Yes.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.720
Gosh, you smell good.
Is that moisturizer?

22:42.600 --> 22:43.960
You shouldn't have.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.200
[Boomer]
<i>Fingers and The Freak.</i>

22:49.240 --> 22:52.080
Fuck me, what a nightmare.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.320
Maybe they'll kill each other.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.120
Are you OK, Allie?

23:00.160 --> 23:02.160
Yeah. Course.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.280
Hey, Goldilocks. Hey.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.400
Yeah, you know you're gonna have
to get on top of this, eh?

23:08.440 --> 23:10.120
'Cause Lou, she's like...

23:10.160 --> 23:12.160
she's dealing, and she's
not even trying to hide it.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.400
And now it looks like
The Freak's under her wing so--

23:14.440 --> 23:15.680
So I kill her?

23:15.720 --> 23:17.400
-Well--
-Lou as well?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.760
If I want to stay top dog,
that's what I gotta do, right?

23:20.920 --> 23:23.840
Guys, my lawyer's going
to petition the Ombudsman

23:23.880 --> 23:25.320
to let me call my Dad.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.880
-That's good.
-Yeah.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.680
Well, I mean,
I don't like his chances.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.760
He's got about as much
authority as a Teletubby.

23:30.800 --> 23:31.960
I'll see you guys later.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.200
Is she OK?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.720
Yeah, yeah, she's just got
a lot of shit to deal with.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.200
So I've been thinking.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.440
There might be something
else we can do

23:43.480 --> 23:45.000
to get me
phone access.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.800
Like what?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.480
We drop a note
for Linda in the laundry,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.160
pretending to be Lou,

23:51.200 --> 23:54.000
telling her to meet
in the kitchen.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.880
Then we jump her. Leverage
her to let me call my Dad.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.280
[chuckles]

23:57.320 --> 23:58.880
How?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.920
By threatening to expose
her little arrangement.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.200
Yeah, Lou would get bashed,
but not Smiles.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.200
-Yeah, why would she care?
-Yeah.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.080
Well, I don't think she'd want
to give up her valuable snitch.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.440
Come on, we'll put a pillowcase
or something over her head.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.880
Yeah, I'll do all the talking,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.560
and so long as you guys
stay quiet,

24:15.600 --> 24:16.800
she'll never recognize you.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.040
What do you say?

24:21.080 --> 24:22.640
[sighs]

24:23.680 --> 24:25.240
I guess I owe you one.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.200
[knock on door]

24:30.240 --> 24:31.520
Have you got a minute?

24:36.960 --> 24:40.080
I've completely underestimated
how respected you are

24:40.120 --> 24:41.880
by your colleagues.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.320
And as General Manager, that's
a pretty shameful admission.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.000
I've already
made up my mind, Ann.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.880
And I respect that.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.720
And I'm not
asking you to stay.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.600
Not yet, anyway.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.880
So why are you here?

24:54.440 --> 24:55.640
Vera.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.880
She thinks the world of you,

24:57.920 --> 25:00.880
and God love her, she's pretty
fond of me, too, so...

25:02.120 --> 25:03.920
I think that you and I
should try

25:03.960 --> 25:06.000
and get to know
each other a bit better.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.440
Yeah, I think
it's a bit late for that.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.040
Oh, come on.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.600
Just a quiet drink
somewhere...

25:12.760 --> 25:15.280
away from the stresses
of this place.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.560
See if we can find
some common ground.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.040
They call me The Freak.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.240
The hatred, it's...

25:36.840 --> 25:38.680
it's visceral.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.880
Do you know why they're
reacting like that?

25:42.560 --> 25:44.040
No.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.400
Do you want to know why?

25:49.720 --> 25:52.600
I need some parameters.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.920
Hmm.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.880
Like that tank.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.080
[soft gasp]

26:01.120 --> 26:02.840
Yes.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.400
I want to know
what Joan Ferguson did.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.320
I want to remember.

26:12.440 --> 26:16.240
If indeed she is who I am.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.640
Let me ask you.

26:22.880 --> 26:27.800
Is the act of remembering
important to you?

26:28.920 --> 26:30.680
What do you mean?

26:30.720 --> 26:34.920
I could tell you right now
the crimes that she committed.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.600
True, but then
I wouldn't understand why.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.080
Will you help me?

26:49.680 --> 26:51.240
To remember?

26:52.280 --> 26:54.360
Yes, of course.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.000
Are you going to have
a drink with Ann?

27:04.440 --> 27:05.680
Did you put her up to it?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.240
What is the harm?

27:07.280 --> 27:09.480
If you feel the same way
afterwards, you can quit,

27:09.520 --> 27:11.320
and we will all go with you.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.240
You've got the power
now, Will.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.160
You can negotiate
on your terms.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.040
Do not waste
the opportunity.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.000
[Jackson]
I don't need any more friends.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.280
I need a General Manager
who trusts me to do my job

27:34.320 --> 27:35.880
and lets me get on with it.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.080
OK.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.720
No more micromanaging.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.120
What else?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.800
I want to be part
of the decision-making,

27:42.840 --> 27:44.840
not just left to deal
with the consequences.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.480
What do you suggest?

27:46.520 --> 27:48.640
I want to go to the fortnightly
board meetings.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.600
I won't implement policies
that I haven't had a say in.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.640
Fine. But you're gonna
regret that one.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.200
Those meetings
are excruciating.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.120
So's being handed
a done deal.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.480
Thank you.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.560
OK, what else?

28:07.800 --> 28:09.280
Novak returns to the laundry.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.160
Moving her chipped
away some of her power.

28:12.200 --> 28:16.040
If she's not top dog, it makes
our job that much harder.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.680
Well, the last thing I want
to do is cause instability,

28:21.720 --> 28:24.640
so... I hear you.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.440
Let's address it.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.880
Cheers.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.280
Cheers.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.320
And I want a pay rise.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.960
[snickers]

28:37.000 --> 28:39.600
You did that deliberately.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.960
-Here, have an olive.
-Thanks.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.160
You want one of those?

28:46.200 --> 28:47.760

29:10.040 --> 29:11.840
[woman #8]
Fuckin' Freak!

29:11.880 --> 29:13.240
Give it a week or so.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.040
They'll move on
to someone else.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.800
[woman]
Don't let the bed bugs bite!

29:18.840 --> 29:20.000
I'm Marie.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.080
Hello.

29:22.120 --> 29:25.280
-My name is K--
-[woman] Ferguson!

29:25.320 --> 29:28.000
[woman #2]
Yeah, just you wait, bitch!

29:29.440 --> 29:30.440
[woman #2] Fucking...

29:30.480 --> 29:33.120
Do we have history?

29:33.160 --> 29:36.200
-No.
-[woman] You're a fucking bitch!

29:36.240 --> 29:38.200
Do you know what I've done?

29:38.240 --> 29:39.720
Not specifically.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.640
But you know it's not good.

29:41.680 --> 29:46.040
[woman]
Fergie, we're waitin' for ya!

29:46.080 --> 29:47.680
You really don't remember,
do you?

29:47.720 --> 29:50.360
They think they can help me
recover my memory.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.200
[woman] You Freak!

29:52.240 --> 29:53.960
Is that what you want?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.680
[woman] Freak!

29:55.720 --> 29:57.000
[women chanting]
Freak! Freak! Freak!

29:57.040 --> 29:58.920
Yes.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.600
Sure.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.480
People take drugs
to get to the state you're in.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.520
To forget the past.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.520
[women chanting]
Freak! Freak! Freak!

30:15.720 --> 30:17.720
Sometimes I wish
I could forget.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.560
Joan, if any time
that you want to--

30:24.600 --> 30:28.240
Would you mind calling
me Kath, please?

30:28.280 --> 30:30.240
Kath.

30:34.880 --> 30:39.840
[woman]
You're fuckin' dead, Freak!

30:41.560 --> 30:44.760
[woman howls]

30:49.720 --> 30:52.280
-I can't sleep.
-Yeah, me too.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.760
[woman] Ferguson!

30:55.800 --> 30:57.640
Can I tell ya something?

30:57.680 --> 31:02.280
-Yeah, of course.
-We're gonna get you!

31:02.320 --> 31:07.600
I talked to this guy today,
right before I got bashed.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.160
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.040
Name's Gavin.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.840
Gavin?

31:13.880 --> 31:16.560
Oh, ya big sexy bitch!

31:18.600 --> 31:21.240
I got his number.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.640
I might even,
like, call him again.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.680
Hey, that's deadly, sis.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.560
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.760
Ah, there's my Lyft.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.960
Can I--can I drop you
off somewhere?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.800
No, I'm good.
I'm the other way.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.040
I'm glad we did this, Will.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.480
Yeah. Me too.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.160
You OK?

31:58.520 --> 31:59.840
Oh, God.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.320
'Night, Ann.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.000
Morning, Ann.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.040
Hey, I just got a call
from the Ombudsman.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.480
Bryant's request to call
her father's been approved.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.840
I'll arrange it.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.400
Good morning.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.600
Morning.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.920
Glad to see
you're still here.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.000
Hanging in there.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.800
So I take it last night
didn't go that badly?

32:40.840 --> 32:42.000
Yeah.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.840
[telephone rings]

33:00.240 --> 33:01.680
[Miles]
Hello, laundry?

33:19.920 --> 33:22.160
-OK?
-Yeah.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.640
I, uh, I nicked one of these.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.640
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.400
-Yeah?
-Bryant.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.960
Your request to call
your father has been approved.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.560
I'll collect you after lunch.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.320
-Hey!
-Hey, Teletubby
lawyer came through!

33:35.360 --> 33:37.360
-That's deadly.
-Yeah, that's awesome.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.720
Wait, so,
we don't need Smiles?

33:39.760 --> 33:42.360
Not anymore.

[overlapping chatter]

33:47.000 --> 33:49.520
[telephone ringing]

33:51.760 --> 33:54.160
Hello. Hi, Gavin?

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
This is Susan,
from Maynard Market Research.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.000
[Gavin]<i> Susan, how lovely</i>
<i>to hear from you.</i>

34:01.040 --> 34:03.040
<i>I was hoping you'd call back.</i>

34:03.080 --> 34:04.520
Yeah, yeah, I just... I...

34:04.560 --> 34:07.040
I just had some
follow-up questions.

34:07.080 --> 34:10.360
<i>But--sure, but I'd just like</i>
<i>to know a bit more about you.</i>

34:10.400 --> 34:13.080
<i>Who's behind that sexy voice?</i>

34:15.720 --> 34:19.000
Yep, yeah, sure. Um...

34:20.240 --> 34:22.640
Well, I'm...
I'm 25 years old.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.800
-<i> OK.</i>
-I... I...

34:24.840 --> 34:26.520
I do a bit of modelling.

34:26.560 --> 34:27.960
Mostly swimwear.

34:31.440 --> 34:35.680
So it's really important
to me to, um, keep active.

34:35.720 --> 34:37.000
-Right.
-Stay in shape.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.920
Yeah. And I'm
an awesome cook, too.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.320
<i>Oh!</i>

34:41.360 --> 34:44.480
I like to lick the bowl.

34:44.520 --> 34:45.680
<i>Wow.</i>

34:45.720 --> 34:47.280
You know, like...
like Nigella.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.240
<i>-Cool!</i>
-Yeah.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.920
<i>-I like Nigella.</i>
-Yeah.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.680
Why aren't you on a call?

34:53.720 --> 34:55.240
-Back to it, Jenkins.
-Yep.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.880
[Gavin]
<i>What was that?</i>

34:56.920 --> 34:59.800
Hey? Ah,
just stupid Jenkins,

34:59.840 --> 35:02.960
just, you know,
just slacking off.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.480
[chuckling]

35:04.520 --> 35:07.680
<i>So tell me, Susan,</i>
<i>what do you look like?</i>

35:08.520 --> 35:09.840
What do I look like?

35:18.360 --> 35:19.800
Well, I've got blonde hair.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.600
Blue eyes.
I'm not too tall.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.800
Just normal.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.600
But better than normal,
you know.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.720
<i>-Wow.</i>
-Yeah.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.360
<i>You sound like</i>

[knock on door]

35:40.680 --> 35:41.920
Thank you, Ms. Miles.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.120
Take a seat.

35:47.320 --> 35:51.600
This will be a supervised call
to the number provided...

35:53.680 --> 35:56.160
of no more than five minutes.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.680
It will be monitored
and recorded.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.880
It's late there.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.480
-<i> Hello?</i>
-Dad, it's me.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.800
<i>Judy.</i>

36:14.840 --> 36:19.080
They want to extradite me, Dad,
to the States.

<i>I can't help, peanut.</i>

36:22.560 --> 36:24.720
<i>I won't be fighting</i>
<i>the extradition.</i>

36:26.560 --> 36:28.200
Why not?

36:28.240 --> 36:30.160
<i>You know why not.</i>

36:30.200 --> 36:32.480
-<i> I'm sorry.</i>
-Sorry?

36:32.520 --> 36:35.440
They're going to
throw me in a fucking hole
for the rest of my life.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.320
I get how embarrassing
this is for you, Dad.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.120
But I didn't do it,

36:41.160 --> 36:43.600
and the quickest way
to make it go away is to get--

36:43.640 --> 36:45.120
<i>I have to go.</i>

36:45.160 --> 36:47.080
You know what they're
gonna do to me, Dad.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.120
You have to help me!

36:50.000 --> 36:51.320
You have to help me.

<i>You had so many</i>
<i>opportunities, Judy.</i>

37:04.600 --> 37:06.840
<i>I did everything</i>
<i>I could to steer you</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

37:06.880 --> 37:08.360
God, steer me?

37:08.400 --> 37:10.280
[laughs]

37:10.320 --> 37:13.160
What a fucking joke.
I never saw you.

37:24.920 --> 37:26.600
Dad, I'm sorry.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.040
I just...
I really need your help.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.320

38:13.880 --> 38:16.000
How could he be like that?

38:16.040 --> 38:17.400
Send Ms. Miles in.

38:26.360 --> 38:29.240
You must be
such a disappointment.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.760
Let's go, Bryant.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.480
I'm gonna call
him back tomorrow.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.920
Reckon he's got a big cock.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.280
-You can tell from his voice?
-Yep.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.600
-Skills.
-Mm-hmm.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.000
[Boomer] Hey.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.880
Is she OK?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.120
Dunno.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.040
Hey, how'd you go
with your Dad?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.440
There was no phone call.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.080
Miles was taking the piss.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.200
-What?
-Bloody moll.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.600
You still got that spit bag?

39:24.480 --> 39:27.280
[rain falling]

39:30.480 --> 39:32.160
Maybe she's not coming, eh?

39:32.200 --> 39:33.320
Of course she is.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.120
She left the
backdoor unlocked.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.240
-Maybe she knows it's us.
-Well, stop bloody
talking, then!

39:42.280 --> 39:43.720
I need to wee.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.440
Shut up.

-Is she dead?
-I knew it, you bitch.

You're such a disappointment.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.960
-No!
-No, Judy, stop it!

Judy, no!

40:46.080 --> 40:48.360
-What the fuck was that?
-I don't know, I lost it.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.000
What, you lost it?

40:50.040 --> 40:51.560
Do you even know how much
shit you have put us in?

40:51.600 --> 40:52.720
I'm not the bad guy here.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.160
You flogged
the fuck out of her!

40:54.200 --> 40:55.240
She's the enemy, not me.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.000
She's in bed
with that NSO prick.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.960
-She's behind my extradition.
-The fuckin' GM!

sign up for this.
-We have to go and tell Allie.

-We can't!
-No, we have to.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.880
-[woman] I'm bloody putting
on heaps of weight.
-Allie, don't.

-Your body looks great.
-Eating prison food...

41:29.280 --> 41:30.760
Leave us.
