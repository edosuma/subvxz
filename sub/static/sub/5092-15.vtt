WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:07.808
How are we doing here?

00:07.841 --> 00:10.778
Now, remember, these radios are
good for about 200 yards, tops.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.146
After that, the
repeaters crap out,

00:12.180 --> 00:13.647
and reception's spotty.

00:13.681 --> 00:14.815
Modern technology, huh?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.185
Yeah. I just need to
finish wiring the car

00:17.218 --> 00:19.253
and you guys
are good to go.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.754
Yo, back in the day,

00:20.788 --> 00:23.124
you ever think we'd be these
old, married family guys?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.792
Are you kidding me?
At least I was smart enough

00:24.825 --> 00:26.727
to stop at two kids, unlike you.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.196
I miss them days, man.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.098
All I did was chase skirts
and catch bad guys.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.265
Well,
look on the bright side,

00:31.299 --> 00:33.734
you still get to catch bad guys.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.536
That's true, that's true.
Now I get to live

00:35.569 --> 00:37.271
vicariously
through this playboy.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.073
Yeah, well somebody had
to pick up your slack, Jack.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.341
JACKIE:
All right, should I leave

00:40.374 --> 00:42.443
while you guys reminisce
about the good ol' days?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.212
DANNY:
Eh, it's just guy talk.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.846
What time is the christening
anyway?
Come on, man, you know

00:45.879 --> 00:47.581
how Tracy gets
about people being late.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.783
I'm joking. Look, you think
my wife would let me be late?

00:49.817 --> 00:50.718
It's all she's talked
about for weeks,

00:50.751 --> 00:53.187
is how excited she is
to be a godmother.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.455
Sarge!

00:54.488 --> 00:56.590
All right, here we go.
Let's do this.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.159
Here's your 50 grand.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.427
Don't run away with it.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.528
Vegas, here we come.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.562
(chuckles)
Yeah.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.464
Reagan and Curatola
are gonna your ghosts tonight.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.632
All right?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.334
Let's go over the codes.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.835
Any reference you use
to good weather

01:07.868 --> 01:09.203
means things are going okay.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.272
Reference
to bad weather means

01:11.305 --> 01:12.640
things are getting
a little hinky.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.143
And "geek" means come
and come heavy.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.110
Let's hope we don't get
to "geek."

01:16.144 --> 01:17.345
Or we will come heavy.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.147
Exactly.
As always,

01:19.180 --> 01:20.214
the uncles are in control.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.383
You guys can call it off
for any reason you see fit.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.451
All right?
Got it.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.118
All right.

01:24.152 --> 01:26.887
Here's you date for tonight.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.156
JACKIE:
Why is he looking so smug?

01:28.189 --> 01:30.791
He's been one
elusive dude.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.360
We've been buying our
way up the food chain

01:32.393 --> 01:35.129
to Señor David Fernandez
for the last six months.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.130
Well, let's not spook him.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.432
The idea is to get
a few buys from Fernandez,

01:38.466 --> 01:39.700
right, with some major weight,

01:39.733 --> 01:41.169
and then get to his source.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.171
All right?
Let's go.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.205
DANNY:
Let's rock and roll.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.240
Let's do it.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.512
(engines starting)

02:03.624 --> 02:06.227
Okay, now we get
these four bars intro,

02:06.260 --> 02:07.695
and then we sing together.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.530
You ready?

02:09.563 --> 02:11.932
Oh, come on, Nicky.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.503
I know you're a little rusty,
but it's all in your head.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.671
You're a terrific singer.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.573
I know, I know,
it's just...

02:19.607 --> 02:20.774
I'm trying
to remember the words.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.875
It's been a while.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.311
What are you two up to?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.445
HENRY:
Hi.
Hey.

02:24.478 --> 02:28.749
Nicky is going to accompany me
at the parish talent show.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.518
Wouldn't miss it.
Wow.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.520
Sister Josephine always said

02:32.553 --> 02:34.622
that you had
the best voice in town.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.457
Yeah, well, Sister
Josephine was an ogre.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.359
Well, still,
it killed me when you quit.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.527
When was it

02:39.560 --> 02:40.794
you quit choir?
Seventh grade.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.762
It was between singing

02:41.795 --> 02:44.932
and soccer, and I didn't
have time for both.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.867
So, Pop,
you brought in a ringer.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.769
You must really want
to win this thing.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.471
HENRY:
Hey, listen, last year

02:50.504 --> 02:52.840
Jack Smith brought his grandson,
and that kid made it

02:52.873 --> 02:54.675
to the third round
of American Idol.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.211
So, I got Nicky.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.479
Besides, I made
a little side bet

02:58.512 --> 02:59.980
with Jack.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.549
What was the bet?

03:01.582 --> 03:03.217
Bottle of Irish single malt.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.954
You have my 15-year-old daughter
performing for whiskey?

03:06.987 --> 03:08.055
Oh.

03:08.088 --> 03:11.892
My doctor always stressed
the importance of hydration.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.795
You know, Nicky,
Pop made me sing with him once.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.230
But only once.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.832
It was
the Emerald Society benefit.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.201
It was ugly.
(laughing)

03:23.604 --> 03:25.539
DANNY:
That's him.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.242
JACKIE:
That's David Fernandez,
the big-time drug dealer?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.410
Yep.
Looks like a pipsqueak.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.779
Al Capone was a runt, too.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.814
(car alarm wailing
in distance)

03:35.649 --> 03:37.385
(alarm stops)

03:39.920 --> 03:41.689
CRUZ:
What's up, Papa?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.324
How you feeling?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.493
Drive.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.762
(engine starting)

03:48.796 --> 03:49.930
He's in.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.932
Let's go.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.911
Next corner,
make a right.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.045
CRUZ:
Right here on Pulaski?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.514
FERNANDEZ:
Yeah.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.984
Right again.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.920
CRUZ:
Right here on Eagle?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.589
FERNANDEZ:
Yeah.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.959
Whoa, whoa, watch it.
Hey! Hey!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.060
(horn honking)

04:20.093 --> 04:21.362
Move it!

04:21.395 --> 04:22.796
Move, moron!

04:22.830 --> 04:23.864
(truck horn blows)
Get out of the...!

04:29.403 --> 04:31.872
Jackass.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.508
Y'all believe that, uh,

04:34.542 --> 04:36.644
pitchers and catchers
reported this week?

04:36.677 --> 04:39.347
Sunny and 80 in Florida.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.449
You into Yankees or Mets?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.016
What do I care
about baseball?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.321
(radio static)
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.958
FERNANDEZ:
This corner, make a left,
and let's pick up the pace.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.693
Let's go left.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.328
You better have
that weight, man.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.797
Don't worry about
what I got or don't got.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.367
DANNY:
They must have turned

04:59.400 --> 05:00.701
down one of these streets.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.436
JACKIE:
Yeah, but which one?

05:02.470 --> 05:05.539
Yeah, I used to deliver oil
right down here.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.007
Ash Street.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.976
Ash! Ash was back there.
Hang on.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.913
(tires squealing)

05:18.452 --> 05:20.020
Hey, here's my man now.

05:25.693 --> 05:26.860
What's up, player?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.429
It's cold out
there, huh?

05:28.462 --> 05:29.930
I'm not getting them
on the walkie, Jack.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.032
Okay, okay.
Where the hell are they?

05:32.065 --> 05:33.401
We lost them.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.372
(static over radio)

05:38.406 --> 05:39.707
I got nothing.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.075
(gunshots)

05:46.046 --> 05:48.048
(tires squealing)

05:52.420 --> 05:54.054
(tires screeching)

05:59.793 --> 06:01.094
They're hit, Jack.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.796
They're hit!

06:02.830 --> 06:04.131
Roland!

06:04.164 --> 06:05.833
Roland... no!
He's alive.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.501
He's alive.
He's alive.
Come here, come here.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.902
Okay.
Buddy.

06:08.936 --> 06:09.970
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.439
Don't do this.
Central?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.973
Don't do this to me.
Yeah, we got a 10-13

06:13.006 --> 06:14.141
on the corner of Ash
and Fulton.
Look at me.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.576
You and Tracy got a
big day coming up.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.077
You hear me?
Yeah, we got two MOS.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.679
We... we need a bus.
We need a bus.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.047
No!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.749
Okay. They appear
to be shot.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.450
(sobbing)

06:51.745 --> 06:53.781
Come on, Jackie.
Pull him in.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.883
Come on!

06:55.916 --> 06:57.518
Hang in there, Cruz.
Yeah, I got him, Danny.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.786
Take care of
him, Jack.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.854
Go! Go! Go!

07:00.888 --> 07:02.856
(siren wailing)

07:02.890 --> 07:03.991
All right, the perp,

07:04.024 --> 07:06.527
David Fernandez, he left his cap
in the back of the car.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.861
You got it.
Yeah, I got
the hat.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.029
Here's your man,
here's your man.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.698
DANNY:
Has he got the scent?

07:10.731 --> 07:11.832
Get the scent, boy.
Get the scent.
Hurry up! Come on!

07:11.865 --> 07:12.766
(dog barks)
Get your man, boy.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.967
All right, he's got the scent.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.102
All right, let's go!
Let's move it!

07:17.938 --> 07:19.940
(dog barking)

07:26.246 --> 07:27.615
He went out the back.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.616
DANNY:
Out the back.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.917
(barking)

07:29.950 --> 07:31.852
Out the back!

07:32.886 --> 07:35.923
(barking)

07:35.956 --> 07:36.824
Hey, what's wrong with the dog?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.926
He lost the trail.
What's wrong with him?!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.060
He lost the trail.
What do you mean,
he lost...?

07:40.093 --> 07:42.062
He lost it.
Where'd they go?!

07:42.095 --> 07:45.265
They got in a car
and drive away.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.768
Son of a bitch!

07:48.836 --> 07:50.804
(sighs)

07:50.838 --> 07:52.840
(distant siren wailing)

07:58.779 --> 08:00.581
Commissioner.
FRANK: As you were.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.149
What about the search warrants?

08:02.182 --> 08:03.116
First 13
locations tied

08:03.150 --> 08:04.818
to the Fernandez
investigation that were hit

08:04.852 --> 08:06.086
have come up empty.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.121
You're maintaining contact
with the DA's office?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.089
Yes, sir.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.559
Detective Cruz took two
rounds to the torso,

08:11.592 --> 08:12.893
through the seat
of the car.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.094
Missed the
vital organs,

08:14.127 --> 08:17.130
but one bullet's
lodged near his spine.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.934
Potential paralysis?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.136
Surgeon says
it's fifty-fifty.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.905
He's being prepped
for surgery.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.173
They gave him something
for the pain,

08:26.206 --> 08:28.642
but he's in and out.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.601
(long sigh)

09:02.242 --> 09:04.244
Commissioner.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.650
I'm so sorry, sir.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.285
I had a bad
feeling

09:12.319 --> 09:14.021
about this operation.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.824
I didn't trust my gut.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.627
I knew when we had lost
the ghosts, I...

09:19.660 --> 09:21.294
We've all been there, Jose.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.663
Next thing I know,

09:22.696 --> 09:24.264
I'm on my way to the hospital.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.233
They told me I was shot.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.769
The doctors
are going to fix you up.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.204
Gates.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.043
Oh, man.

09:36.076 --> 09:40.080
Before we turned out
tonight, he...

09:40.113 --> 09:42.850
he was talking
about christening his kid

09:42.883 --> 09:45.653
and the party he
was going to throw.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.256
I hope he gets out
in time for that.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.872
(phone ringing)

10:08.175 --> 10:10.243
(clears throat)

10:10.277 --> 10:12.379
Danny, hi.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.114
Hey.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.050
Look, I'm, uh... I'm sorry
to wake you so late, babe.

10:17.084 --> 10:20.020
It's a... it's a bad night.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.421
What?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.791
What happened?

10:23.824 --> 10:24.958
It's Roland.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.259
Roland?

10:26.293 --> 10:27.394
What about him?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.329
There was a shooting, Linda.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.900
Is he dead?

10:35.936 --> 10:37.738
Oh, my God.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.373
I know his family
is on the way up for the...

10:40.407 --> 10:42.009
the christening,
and, uh, Tracy's alone.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.243
They haven't arrived yet.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.378
Can you just go look after her?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.047
O-Okay, of course.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.648
I will.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.984
I will.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.319
What about you?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.320
I'm good.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.255
Y-You be careful.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.190
You promise me.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.426
Always.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.432
(sighs)

11:07.434 --> 11:09.269
What's that?

11:09.302 --> 11:11.471
A little scratch.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.173
That's too much blood
for a scratch.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.776
Reagan temper, you know?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.945
How you holding up?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.815
We lost him.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.317
I know.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.487
GORMLEY:
Hey, listen up.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.856
Commissioner's on his way in.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.858
He'd like to take a minute...

11:30.891 --> 11:32.392
Attention!

11:34.427 --> 11:36.096
Thank you, Sergeant.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.965
At ease.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.503
Detective Cruz has come
through surgery in good shape.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.339
I'm happy to say
that he will walk...

11:48.175 --> 11:50.944
...through those doors
on his own two feet.

11:50.978 --> 11:54.848
I have spoken
to Roland Gates' family.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.817
They're holding up well...

11:56.850 --> 11:59.419
considering.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.491
When a cop is killed...

12:04.524 --> 12:07.394
we don't rest.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.930
The 5-4 was home

12:09.963 --> 12:12.933
to these two
brave detectives.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.468
When someone
violates our home...

12:15.502 --> 12:17.237
it's personal.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.473
Stay focused.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.309
Do your job.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.347
We need to get these
sons of bitches.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.415
Carry on.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.487
GORMLEY:
Okay.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.323
TARU retrieved this
from the camera

12:36.356 --> 12:38.258
inside the undercover car.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.293
It ain't pretty.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.935
Hey, here's my man
right now.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.438
What's up, player?

12:51.471 --> 12:54.207
It's cold out
there, huh?

12:54.241 --> 12:56.009
(two gunshots)

12:57.878 --> 13:00.814
I got three kids, man.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.515
Too bad for them.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.517
(gunshot)

13:04.551 --> 13:07.120
FERNANDEZ:
Damn, Phantom, we was just
supposed to rip them off.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.222
PHANTOM:
Grab the money. Let's bolt.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.361
All right, what else
you got on Fernandez?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.296
Guy moves around
pretty much every night.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.565
Checked all known
locations, nothing.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.968
And the mother was
involved in the operation.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.870
She did a dime for distribution.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.872
DANNY:
Real family values.
She's got a meeting with

13:24.905 --> 13:26.439
her P.O. at 9:00 a.m.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.507
All right, you snatch her up.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.909
Will do.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.911
Back to work.
(phone rings)

13:30.944 --> 13:33.613
Hold on, Jack.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.348
Yeah, Dad.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.986
My... my hand is fine.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.357
I got the message
loud and clear.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.027
Yes, sir.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.561
NICKY:
Come on, Grandpa,
I'm gonna be late for school.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.430
HENRY:
Come on, one more time.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.531
* Together

13:51.564 --> 13:53.433
* At last

13:53.466 --> 13:55.268
* To...

13:55.302 --> 13:57.604
Hey, Nicky.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.106
What's eatin' you, kid?

13:59.139 --> 14:01.274
That detective that was shot.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.442
What about him?

14:02.475 --> 14:05.245
His oldest daughter, Shanna,

14:05.278 --> 14:08.115
she's on my soccer team.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.150
Yeah, that's a shame.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.053
But you shouldn't
be thinking about that.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.322
How awful she must feel.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.524
Besides...

14:17.557 --> 14:19.426
it just seems silly
to be singing songs

14:19.459 --> 14:20.994
at a time like this.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.398
(sighs):
You're right.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.569
(sighs)
You know...

14:29.602 --> 14:31.504
you can never prepare

14:31.538 --> 14:33.440
for this kind of thing,

14:33.473 --> 14:35.642
and I guess
with our young,

14:35.675 --> 14:37.610
we keep trying
to protect you

14:37.644 --> 14:39.646
from the harsh reality

14:39.679 --> 14:41.448
of this life that we chose.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.617
I know, Pop, it's just...
I'm living this life, too.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.520
I mean, I buried
my uncle Joe when I was 13.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.457
I know.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.427
And that kills me.
(soft chuckle)

14:56.964 --> 14:59.399
I just want to show
Shanna my support.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.036
Make her feel
better somehow.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.577
JACKIE (sighs):
Ms. Fernandez...

15:10.610 --> 15:13.580
look, we know that your son
didn't pull the trigger.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.549
But every minute that you stall,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.218
every minute that
you don't cooperate

15:18.251 --> 15:20.453
to help us find
where your son is,

15:20.487 --> 15:22.689
he's getting into
deeper and deeper trouble.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.427
That's one hard bitch.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.562
Yeah. I think an
hour of good cop's

15:29.596 --> 15:32.099
about enough,
don't you?
Go for it.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.741
I keep telling you,
I don't know nothing,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.576
and I ain't done
nothing wrong,

15:43.610 --> 15:45.645
so why the hell
am I here?

15:45.678 --> 15:48.348
Ms. Fernandez, we need you
to help us locate your son.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.450
Ain't seen him.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.052
Okay.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.654
I'm done with you.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.692
(door closes)

15:59.726 --> 16:01.428
Don't you think it's time

16:01.461 --> 16:03.463
that you stopped playing dumb,
Ms. Fernandez?

16:03.496 --> 16:06.299
Tell us who your son's been
running around with these days.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.534
I don't know nothing

16:07.567 --> 16:08.735
about my son's friends.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.204
Well, I suggest you
think hard and fast,

16:11.238 --> 16:13.073
'cause you better
give me something

16:13.106 --> 16:15.375
I can use right now.
Why?

16:15.408 --> 16:17.310
Because some cops got shot?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.212
Too bad.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.614
What you call that?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.683
Hazards of the occupation?

16:23.716 --> 16:26.519
(quietly):
You know, I really hope
that you don't make

16:26.553 --> 16:27.887
another comment like
that right now.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.657
What the hell are you
talking about, cop?
Because I might forget

16:30.690 --> 16:34.027
that you're not a man
and knock your freaking
teeth out, you old witch.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.695
You want to talk
about being a man?

16:35.728 --> 16:38.631
My boy is a real man.
Your boy's a coward!

16:38.665 --> 16:42.035
Not some punk
police like you.

16:42.069 --> 16:45.172
All tough with your
badge and your gun.
Listen, your son's going down

16:45.205 --> 16:46.606
for this one way or the other,

16:46.639 --> 16:49.209
so you want to help him,
you better help me.

16:49.242 --> 16:53.046
Why would I want to help you?
'Cause there are
35,000 cops with guns

16:53.080 --> 16:54.714
hunting his punk-ass down
right now, and if he

16:54.747 --> 16:57.384
so much as blinks when they
find him they will blast him

16:57.417 --> 16:58.718
into the next lifetime,
you understand me?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.621
Hijo de puta.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.823
(slams chair against table)

17:03.856 --> 17:05.725
Is that all you got, white boy?

17:05.758 --> 17:08.661
You'll find out.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.266
She must be angling for
"Mother of the Year" award.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.235
Hey, the dump on
her phone came back.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.804
We got several calls from
an address in, uh, Hunts Point,

17:17.837 --> 17:20.707
all dialed after
the shooting-- possible
location for Fernandez.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.742
Yeah, the mutts always
run home to Mommy.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.245
You hustle, you
can rendezvous
with the ESU guys

17:25.278 --> 17:26.413
before they hit the location.

17:26.446 --> 17:27.514
Save her for me.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.729
Go, go, go!

17:49.869 --> 17:51.804
David Fernandez.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.473
We got a fresh one.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.841
OFFICER:
Closet clear.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.709
OFFICER:
Bedroom clear!

17:56.743 --> 18:00.147
Problem is, he's the only guy
that could I.D. Phantom.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.231
Hello again.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.367
You miss me?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.569
That's okay, I didn't
miss you, either.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.737
But I did get a
chance to rendezvous

18:24.771 --> 18:26.739
with your boy since
we chatted last.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.775
Yeah, whatever.
No, I did.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.810
It's interesting, you
know, I keep thinking,

18:30.843 --> 18:33.280
if his mom wasn't
a drug dealer, that kid

18:33.313 --> 18:35.448
actually might've
had a shot at a good life.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.484
We wasn't living
in no suburbs like you.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.486
Mm. What are you gonna do.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.822
Anyway, I thought
you'd like a little memento.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.825
This picture was taken
of your son earlier.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.694
He's very handsome.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.896
Looks like a movie star,
your boy.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.433
I got nothing for you.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.203
I know, you already
told me that.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.271
Which is a shame,

18:58.305 --> 19:01.508
because I was giving you
a chance to help me help him--

19:01.541 --> 19:04.944
your own flesh and blood--
but you told me to take a hike,

19:04.977 --> 19:07.180
so now...
(clears throat)

19:07.214 --> 19:09.182
here's a more recent
picture of your son.

19:09.216 --> 19:12.519
Go on, check it out.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.921
This was taken
right after Phantom decided

19:14.954 --> 19:16.923
he didn't need
a partner anymore.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.859
So what do you
call it...

19:19.892 --> 19:21.461
one of those
"hazards of the job,"

19:21.494 --> 19:23.162
like you were
telling me about earlier?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.834
(whispers):
You lie, you lie.
No.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.735
No, I don't.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.671
See, if you would've
helped me earlier,

19:31.704 --> 19:34.874
I would've gotten to your boy
before that animal Phantom did,

19:34.907 --> 19:37.644
and that probably
wouldn't have
happened to him.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.479
That's right,

19:39.512 --> 19:41.514
look at him.

19:44.251 --> 19:47.254
Now, Mrs. Fernandez,
you and I both have

19:47.287 --> 19:50.223
a reason to get that
sick son of a bitch Phantom

19:50.257 --> 19:51.424
off the streets.

19:51.458 --> 19:55.395
So you gonna help me?

19:55.428 --> 19:57.564
Or are you gonna let
that coward get away

19:57.597 --> 19:59.732
with doing this to your son?

20:03.936 --> 20:07.006
David was hooking up with...

20:07.039 --> 20:09.542
Nelson Ortiz, the...

20:09.576 --> 20:12.545
the drug dealer
from the Alexander Houses.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.747
And who's Phantom?
I don't know.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.848
I don't know who...

20:15.882 --> 20:17.950
Some guy who was
gonna be muscle for them

20:17.984 --> 20:20.720
when they expanded
their territory.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.995
You keep that one.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.032
Tough stuff.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.535
Well, she wanted to play
hardball, so screw her.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.970
Nelson Ortiz is one
of the big players in
Brooklyn drug trade.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.273
I know. I know him from
the days in Narcotics.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.742
Hmm. He's usually not
very talkative.
That's all right.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.478
I'll pay him a visit,
see if I can loosen
up his tongue.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.280
Linda's here.
Where?

20:47.314 --> 20:49.549
In my office.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.951
All right. Thanks.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.290
Hey.
Hey.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.659
Didn't know when
you'd be home, so I, uh...

20:59.692 --> 21:00.893
brought you some clothes.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.829
Great, I could use them.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.531
How's Tracy?

21:04.564 --> 21:07.334
Well, I had to...

21:07.367 --> 21:09.001
help her pick out her
husband's casket,

21:09.035 --> 21:10.537
and so you can imagine.
Yeah.

21:10.570 --> 21:14.541
I had to hold her and tell
her everything was gonna
be okay for her, but...

21:14.574 --> 21:16.576
(sighs)
it's not gonna
be okay for her.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.045
No, her life's never
gonna be the same.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.014
You okay?

21:22.048 --> 21:23.550
Yeah, I'm okay.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.386
I really wanted just
to give you a hug.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.589
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.090
I know.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.492
I know.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.027
I appreciate it.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.696
Yeah, well, it
is what it is.

21:36.729 --> 21:37.864
Yeah.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.533
I brought you your favorite tie.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.005
They're making
that roast chicken

21:46.038 --> 21:48.408
that you love
for Sunday dinner.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.076
If you don't make it,

21:50.109 --> 21:51.744
I'll bring you a plate.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.446
Thank you.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.715
I got to get back to Tracy.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.618
They're going ahead
with the baptism.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.762
(footsteps approaching)

22:15.402 --> 22:17.604
I put together an update
on the manhunt.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.672
I'd like to get it out
right away.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.408
Do you want to have a look?

22:21.441 --> 22:24.110
Does your update have
the killer in custody?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.713
I wish it did.

22:26.746 --> 22:30.116
Just go with what you got.

22:37.890 --> 22:42.462
There are 8.3 million people
in this city, most of 'em good,

22:42.495 --> 22:46.132
some of 'em not,
a few of them dangerously bad.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.939
That your update?
No.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.508
This is me talking to you.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.777
There's a lot
of moving parts,

22:57.810 --> 23:00.179
and it's inevitable that
some of the good ones

23:00.212 --> 23:02.449
are gonna get
crushed by the bad.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.184
And there's no one man,
or even an army,

23:05.217 --> 23:08.488
that can prevent that
from happening all the time.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.490
Two hundred seventy-one.

23:11.157 --> 23:12.959
What's that?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.627
That's the number
of line-of-duty deaths

23:14.661 --> 23:17.730
since I came on the job
as a rookie.

23:22.469 --> 23:25.404
In my office if you need me.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.975
Thank you, Garrett.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.079
(door closes)

23:45.825 --> 23:47.660
(big sigh)

23:48.861 --> 23:51.163
Danny, I keep trying
to tell myself

23:51.197 --> 23:53.533
that we did
everything we could,

23:53.566 --> 23:56.068
but it ain't working.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.506
I don't know if we're
ever gonna believe we
did all we could, Jack.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.040
We should've been there;
we weren't.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.842
You saw the video--
if we were there,

24:02.875 --> 24:05.144
even if we were there, they
would've got shots off, right?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.179
(quietly):
Yeah.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.549
Am I taking this too personal?

24:10.717 --> 24:12.752
It is personal.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.554
Let's go.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.158
MAN:
We're closed.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.160
So what the hell
are you doing here?

24:21.193 --> 24:22.595
Just doing my job.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.498
Is that right?
Is Nelson scared
of somebody?

24:25.532 --> 24:26.899
Look, ain't nothin' here
for y'all.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.200
Well, we'll see
about that ourselves.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.640
Call him a bus.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.177
MAN:
Hey, how the hell
did you get past Felix?

24:38.210 --> 24:40.046
Shut your mouth,
or you're gonna

24:40.079 --> 24:41.280
find out quick.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.949
Detective Reagan.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.216
Still running amok.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.218
I need answers from you.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.488
You first.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.736
I don't know nothin'
about no cop being killed, man.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.673
No clue, huh?

25:06.706 --> 25:10.009
Okay. And what about
your new partner?

25:10.042 --> 25:12.979
You have any clue what
Phantom did to him?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.714
Hmm?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.549
You're bleeding.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.118
It's an occupational hazard.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.554
You probably know about
those now, don't you?

25:21.588 --> 25:22.989
Working with a guy like Phantom.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.958
Must be bad
for business

25:25.992 --> 25:27.226
having a guy like that
running around.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.261
Those real?

25:31.664 --> 25:32.932
Pretty impressive.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.967
I bet you're handy
with 'em, huh?

25:35.001 --> 25:36.969
I know my way around 'em.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.571
Why don't you take it down.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.006
Take a look at one.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.846
This is an authentic Uchigatana.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.881
700 years old.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.252
Here's how
my testimony's gonna go.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.255
The subject grabbed a sword
down from the wall.

25:56.288 --> 25:59.659
I ordered him to drop the sword;
he failed to comply.

25:59.692 --> 26:03.696
Blada, blada, blada,
I feared for my life,
so I had no choice

26:03.730 --> 26:06.332
but to discharge my service
weapon into the subject,

26:06.365 --> 26:09.101
striking him several times
in the chest and face.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.905
You want to tell me
who Phantom is?

26:12.939 --> 26:14.774
You're crazy.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.777
I'm not in the mood
to take "no" for an answer.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.149
This guy Phantom's like some
original gangster nightmare

26:23.182 --> 26:24.617
from the past, man.

26:24.651 --> 26:25.351
Who is he?

26:26.853 --> 26:27.286
Who is he?!

26:27.319 --> 26:29.255
All I know is,

26:29.288 --> 26:31.357
he was gone before
I got out of grade school, man.

26:31.390 --> 26:33.626
They used to tell us
these Phantom stories

26:33.660 --> 26:34.794
like they'd tell us
ghost stories.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.630
They all dead
from the crack war days.

26:37.664 --> 26:38.665
Problem is, Phantom ain't dead.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.100
No, Phantom isn't dead.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.102
And he's not a ghost.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.905
So I want you to tell me
who he is right now.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.776
His last name is Washington.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.977
That's all I know.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.879
You can shoot me
all you want, man.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.882
I'm not gonna shoot you.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.184
I got what I wanted.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.328
Reagan.
Yeah.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.397
Phantom's given name
is Donald Washington.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.232
He was one of the youngest
crack kingpins.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.935
Terrorized Brooklyn
back in the day.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.104
He was targeted by a
special narcotics operation,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.406
Task Force Apache.
DANNY:
That's Phantom.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.573
Where the hell's
this son of a bitch

27:21.607 --> 27:22.809
been hiding out
the past few years?
Just got released

27:22.842 --> 27:26.212
from Raiford Penitentiary in
Florida after serving 22 years.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.214
JACKIE:
How did he end up down there?

27:28.247 --> 27:29.448
Went on a major buy in Miami,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.050
decided he wanted
the money and the drugs,

27:31.083 --> 27:32.218
shot four people to get them.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.219
And he's out already?

27:33.252 --> 27:34.353
Got a reduced sentence

27:34.386 --> 27:36.088
for ratting out
his Colombian suppliers.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.790
You mean the ones
he didn't kill.
Yeah.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.727
Most of that whole generation
was wiped out,

27:40.760 --> 27:43.796
but we did track down one of his
old running partners, Ray Bell.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.397
Guy looks like he, uh,
dropped the bad habits

27:45.431 --> 27:46.432
and became a citizen.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.134
Runs a barbershop in Brooklyn.

27:48.167 --> 27:48.968
Barbershop?

27:49.001 --> 27:52.338
Great. Wife says
I could use a trim.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.682
Ray Bell.
You talk for a second?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.318
It's closing time.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.319
Really?

28:07.353 --> 28:09.055
How about now?

28:09.088 --> 28:11.323
I just seen him
on the news.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.258
You seen him in person?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.193
Not since the smart
Bush was president.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.728
He hasn't reached out to you
at all?

28:15.762 --> 28:18.064
No. And I hope he don't.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.066
I was young and dumb once.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.201
I did three years
for selling crack cocaine.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.136
And he stayed young and dumb.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.371
Mm-hmm.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.174
You became a good guy,
just like that.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.209
That was another life.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.011
Another Ray Bell.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.246
All right, Mr. Ray Bell.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.849
You know where I could find
any of the old crew?

28:36.883 --> 28:39.251
If I was you,
I'd try looking in the cemetery.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.287
(door opens)

28:41.320 --> 28:43.089
Put that gadget away.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.223
Come here.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.092
This is Derek,
my youngest.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.326
Say hello to
the detective.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.460
Nice to meet you, sir.

28:48.494 --> 28:51.263
Nice to meet you, too, Derek.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.132
I'll tell you what, Mr. Bell.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.333
You see or hear anything,

28:54.366 --> 28:56.235
why don't you give me a call,
all right?

29:00.239 --> 29:02.241
Take it easy, kid.

29:03.342 --> 29:06.212
Go ahead, sit down.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.319
I don't like funerals.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.188
HENRY:
I've had my fill of them myself.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.257
Pass the stuffing, please.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.525
Except when you're serving
the Mass.

29:19.558 --> 29:20.993
People tip good at funerals.

29:21.027 --> 29:21.994
LINDA:
"Well."

29:22.028 --> 29:23.195
Tip well.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.197
Is that why you became
an alter boy, Jack?

29:25.231 --> 29:27.399
No, Grandpa.
Okay.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.768
And we're not going
to a funeral, we're
going to a christening.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.905
NICKY:
I called Shanna Gates.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.373
I'm gonna ride with her
to church.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.342
And I invited her
to come hear us sing.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.276
Terrific!

29:37.309 --> 29:38.444
That's great, honey.

29:39.912 --> 29:40.980
Where's Dad?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.915
He's working a case.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.051
You worried about
your dad, Sean?

29:45.084 --> 29:46.052
Is he gonna be okay?

29:46.085 --> 29:49.255
Yeah. Most of the time,
detective work's boring.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.257
Not when you're getting shot at.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.226
Yeah, well, most of the time
you're not getting shot at.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.862
But when you join the force,
it comes with the territory.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.897
HENRY:
Detective Gates

29:57.930 --> 30:00.232
made a choice.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.868
He knew what the dangers were.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.836
Well, I don't think that
that's a comfort

30:03.870 --> 30:05.304
to Tracy Gates right now.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.374
What do you think, Jack?

30:08.407 --> 30:09.508
JACK:
I think...

30:09.541 --> 30:11.477
you get two lives.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.246
The one you're born into,
and the one you choose.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.283
Unless you're a Reagan.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.887
You always get a choice, Jack.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.021
(sighs)

30:22.054 --> 30:23.389
Maybe I don't want a choice.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.256
Oh, boy.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.893
What happened to
wanting to be a doctor?

30:26.926 --> 30:28.427
(door closes)
Yeah, or a lawyer, huh, bud?

30:28.460 --> 30:29.996
Hey.

30:30.029 --> 30:30.963
Hey!

30:30.997 --> 30:32.932
Sorry I'm late.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.266
Wow. You look like crap.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.467
Thank you.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.635
Hey.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.270
What's up with the hand?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.306
Uh...
ah, I cut myself shaving.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.374
Lots of chicken in the oven.
Yeah.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.610
I got my eyes on a piece
right here that looks perfect.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.179
You can't do that.
JAMIE:
Law of the Reagan jungle, Jack,

30:47.213 --> 30:48.314
protect your food at all times.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.117
Around here,
you snooze, you lose.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.661
DANNY:
Hey. Rise and shine, partner.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.330
Look at you.
New clothes.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.597
Yeah.

31:05.631 --> 31:06.698
My old clothes smelled so bad

31:06.732 --> 31:08.534
my family threw me out
of Sunday dinner yesterday.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.069
Oh-oh.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.237
Get any rest?

31:11.270 --> 31:13.672
No. Every time I close my eyes,
I just...

31:13.705 --> 31:15.341
I know the feeling,
partner, but look,

31:15.374 --> 31:17.143
we may have some good news.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.244
Guy named Jamal Williams

31:18.277 --> 31:19.946
was shot dead
in Brooklyn last night.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.214
Doesn't sound like
very good news for Williams.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.449
How's that good news for us?

31:23.482 --> 31:26.118
Because Jamal Williams was shot
dead with a ten millimeter,

31:26.152 --> 31:27.219
same as our guys.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.688
Not only that, a witness
description matches Phantom.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.490
Is it random?
Not random.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.960
Williams was an informant
for Task Force Apache

31:33.993 --> 31:36.328
back in the days,
and he snitched on Phantom.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.965
So Phantom's not just taking
down scores, he's settling them.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.967
Phantom is getting revenge.
Now look at this.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.469
This is a list of old
Brooklyn North Narcotics CIs.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.537
They were all registered,
including Jamal Williams,

31:45.571 --> 31:49.008
but this guy Detective Ryan,
he had one informant

31:49.041 --> 31:50.409
that was not on the register.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.277
His nickname was Snippy.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.179
So Ryan kept informants
off the books.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.613
It was pretty common
back in the days,

31:54.646 --> 31:56.282
but that's not what's important.

31:56.315 --> 31:59.385
What is, is this Detective Ryan,
in all these Snippy reports,

31:59.418 --> 32:01.253
he initialed "R.B."
here in the margins.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.489
Look. "R.B."

32:03.522 --> 32:06.025
Ray Bell. Snippy. The barber.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.393
If they're the
same person,

32:07.426 --> 32:10.029
then Ray Bell
snitched on Phantom, too,

32:10.062 --> 32:12.364
which means Phantom is going
to go after Ray Bell next.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.967
You keep digging in these
files for more informants.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.168
I'll go warn Snippy.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.279
Ray Bell.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.416
Or maybe I should
call you "Snippy"?

32:30.449 --> 32:31.717
I ain't Snippy no more.
Yeah?

32:31.750 --> 32:34.086
Well, you were an informant
for Task Force Apache.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.522
I escaped my past.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.424
I don't care about
your past, all right,

32:38.457 --> 32:39.558
but Phantom does.

32:39.591 --> 32:40.692
He's whacking
old informants, okay,

32:40.726 --> 32:42.394
and you're next on the list.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.263
So why don't you
do yourself a favor,
(cell phone chimes)

32:44.296 --> 32:46.132
and be smart and
help me find the guy.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.503
What is it?

32:51.537 --> 32:52.638
It's my boy, Derek.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.273
He's texting me from
under the bed.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.108
He says some guy's in
my house with a gun.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.643
Whoa, what?
He's got my family.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.578
Whoa! Hey, hey!
Slow down!

32:59.611 --> 33:01.447
I got to save my family
from this animal!

33:01.480 --> 33:03.049
Listen to me!
Take it easy, all right?

33:03.082 --> 33:04.650
I'm here to help you.
Now, where's your family?

33:04.683 --> 33:05.751
What apartment are they in?

33:05.784 --> 33:06.785
3B. Apartment 3B.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.256
3B. All right, and which
window is Derek's bedroom?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.557
Right there by
the fire escape.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.559
Can I get in that window?
It's locked.

33:13.592 --> 33:14.593
All right,
you text your kid, okay?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.462
You tell Derek that
a police officer is coming up

33:16.495 --> 33:18.530
that fire escape, he's got to
open the window and let me in

33:18.564 --> 33:20.432
so I can help him.
He's too scared.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.801
You text him and tell him
to be brave. All right?

33:22.834 --> 33:25.137
Do it.

33:47.226 --> 33:51.697
So Snippy never told you
about his old buddy Phantom?

33:51.730 --> 33:54.633
He thought he was
all free and clear,

33:54.666 --> 33:57.736
his new life without me.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.272
Now he gonna be surprised
when he come home

34:00.306 --> 34:04.243
and finds out
it's old home week, ain't he?

34:04.276 --> 34:06.378
Yes, he is.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.283
(cell phone vibrates)

34:13.385 --> 34:15.221
(cell phone chimes)

34:15.254 --> 34:17.356
He say he's gonna do it.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.525
Call 911.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.846
How long it take that fool
to get some damn milk?

34:49.321 --> 34:50.556
(taps window)

35:02.468 --> 35:04.170
DANNY:
I got you.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.186
*

35:28.360 --> 35:30.662
(clattering)

36:03.662 --> 36:04.863
Drop it or die!

36:04.896 --> 36:06.365
Right here, right now!

36:06.398 --> 36:08.734
Your choice!

36:08.767 --> 36:11.470
You gonna shoot me
in the back, cop?

36:11.503 --> 36:14.373
No, that's what cowards
like you do it.

36:14.406 --> 36:17.743
You ain't got the balls
to shoot me.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.778
Turn around and
find out, punk.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.296
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:43.669 --> 36:46.272
(applause)

36:46.305 --> 36:49.275
MAN:
Our next act is Henry Reagan

36:49.308 --> 36:50.942
and his great-granddaughter
Nicky Reagan-Boyle.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.478
Together they will perform

36:52.511 --> 36:55.881
a rendition of
"I Don't Need Anything But You"

36:55.914 --> 36:57.849
from Annie.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.852
(piano playing
"I Don't Need Anything But You")

37:00.886 --> 37:03.555
(applause)

37:03.589 --> 37:05.824
* Together at last

37:05.857 --> 37:09.395
* Together forever

37:09.428 --> 37:12.431
* We're tying a knot

37:12.464 --> 37:14.933
* They never can sever

37:14.966 --> 37:17.536
* I don't need sunshine now

37:17.569 --> 37:21.373
* To turn my sky to blue

37:21.407 --> 37:25.043
* I don't need anything
but you *

37:25.076 --> 37:28.046
I hate being late.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.416
(cell phone ringing)
Oh.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.419
* We're tying a knot

37:33.452 --> 37:35.421
The life we chose.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.822
* They never can sever

37:36.855 --> 37:37.956
I'll let them know.

37:37.989 --> 37:42.394
* I don't need sunshine now
to turn my sky to blue *

37:42.428 --> 37:43.929
I'm on my way.

37:43.962 --> 37:47.833
* I don't need anything
but you *

37:48.934 --> 37:51.737
* Yesterday was plain awful

37:51.770 --> 37:54.840
* You can say
that again *

37:54.873 --> 37:56.742
* Yesterday was plain awful

37:56.775 --> 37:58.444
* But that's...

37:58.477 --> 37:59.545
* Not now

37:59.578 --> 38:01.580
* That's then

38:01.613 --> 38:04.616
* We're two of a kind

38:04.650 --> 38:07.085
* The happiest pair now

38:07.118 --> 38:10.088
* Like Fred and Adele

38:10.121 --> 38:13.659
* We're floating on air now

38:13.692 --> 38:18.664
* And what's the title of that
dream that just came true? *

38:18.697 --> 38:20.799
* I don't need
anything *

38:20.832 --> 38:21.967
* Anything

38:22.000 --> 38:23.735
* Anything

38:23.769 --> 38:27.005
* I don't need anything

38:27.038 --> 38:32.578
* But you....

38:32.611 --> 38:33.679
(music ends)

38:33.712 --> 38:35.681
(cheering, applause)

38:50.429 --> 38:51.930
Commissioner,
what can you tell us about

38:51.963 --> 38:54.132
the alleged perpetrator,
Donald Washington?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.768
I have nothing more to say
about Donald Washington.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.704
JOURNALIST:
Well, the last couple
of days have brought

38:58.737 --> 39:00.439
the worst kind of
news to this office:

39:00.472 --> 39:04.009
the line-of-duty shooting
of two NYPD detectives.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.512
Detective Gates
and Detective Cruz.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.047
JOURNALIST (over TV):
Can you talk a little bit
about how you manage the force

39:09.080 --> 39:11.082
when a tragedy
like this hits home?

39:11.116 --> 39:13.852
FRANK: Well, I don't know who it
was, but someone wrote,

39:13.885 --> 39:17.489
"Courage is not the absence
of fear, it is the judgment

39:17.523 --> 39:19.791
that something else
is more important than fear."

39:19.825 --> 39:23.929
I try to keep us all focused
on what we do and why we do it,

39:23.962 --> 39:25.030
no matter what
the circumstances.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.197
And how has the loss

39:26.231 --> 39:30.402
of Detective Gates affected
the department as a whole?

39:30.436 --> 39:32.170
Jim, the NYPD is a family.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.973
When you lose
a member of the family,

39:35.006 --> 39:37.876
you come together, you grieve,

39:37.909 --> 39:39.177
then you strengthen your resolve

39:39.210 --> 39:41.780
to carry on in the spirit
of the one you lost.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.450
And how has this affected you
personally, Commissioner?

39:44.483 --> 39:47.052
Loss comes with the job.

39:47.085 --> 39:51.790
Every man and woman who joins
the force is well aware of that.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.026
Doesn't make it any easier
to take when it happens.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.564
I think the toughest part
of my job

39:58.597 --> 40:00.666
is ordering my people
into harm's way every day.
