The third act's begun. You barely
nearly missed the nicest part.

09:42.402 --> 09:45.871
The chopper was delayed. Anyway,
this is the bit i'm really keen on.

Right and double right.

Perchance to dream.

11:21.501 --> 11:23.702
Ay, there's the rub.

11:32.445 --> 11:34.846
For in that sleep of death...

11:35.915 --> 11:38.217
What dreams may come.

Tsk, tsk.

13:21.804 --> 13:26.041
The most essential and fundamental
principle of our work...

13:26.109 --> 13:28.343
Is the absolute
authenticity...

13:28.411 --> 13:32.214
Of any of its employees'
qualifications and credentials.

13:32.282 --> 13:35.918
Each must be tops
in his field. Otherwise--

13:35.985 --> 13:39.788
- well, otherwise it's mere quackery.
- Just what is our work, dad?

13:39.855 --> 13:44.726
It's not so easy to define
as one might think, lad.

13:44.794 --> 13:46.728
Not so easy.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.199
Regard the city.

13:51.267 --> 13:54.702
It's just like where
i was born.

13:54.770 --> 13:58.373
<i>Exactly and 9/10ths of the
people on this planet.</i>

13:58.441 --> 14:01.876
<i>And you know, youngman, some of
those people will tell you...</i>

14:01.945 --> 14:04.546
<i>That in these cities</i>
<i>are shops--</i>

14:04.613 --> 14:08.150
<i>curious sort of food shops that
spring up from time to time...</i>

14:08.217 --> 14:11.653
With signs reading,
"new owner, new policy,

14:11.720 --> 14:13.655
big get acquainted sale."

14:13.957 --> 14:17.876
And offering goods at
ridiculously low giveaway prices.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.246
- What about ciggies?
- Cigarettes were not sold,

14:21.314 --> 14:24.382
as they've been linked rather
closely with cancer of the lung.

14:24.718 --> 14:26.501
The word quickly
gets around...

14:26.569 --> 14:31.306
And the lucky few manage to load up and take
away as much as they can humanly carry.

14:31.374 --> 14:35.610
Usually much more than they can
ever use or keep, you understand.

14:35.678 --> 14:37.612
The shop is quickly gutted--

14:37.680 --> 14:39.714
clean as your proverbial bone.

14:39.782 --> 14:43.251
And latecomers are met by closed
doors, shuttered windows...

14:43.319 --> 14:47.990
And a different sign,
"moved to new location."

14:48.057 --> 14:52.627
But no clue as to where
that new location is.

14:52.695 --> 14:57.065
¶ If you want it

15:22.608 --> 15:25.878
When i bought this paper,

15:25.945 --> 15:30.649
it had one of the highest circulations
of any sunday newspaper in this country.

15:30.716 --> 15:33.051
<i>It was a paper...</i>

15:33.119 --> 15:35.220

15:35.288 --> 15:38.556
Hear! Hear!
And a circulation.

15:38.624 --> 15:41.326
Now just look at this.
Read it out, winthrop.

15:43.797 --> 15:45.730
But, sir guy, you said, uh--

15:45.799 --> 15:48.733
yes, i know what i said,
but read it.

15:48.802 --> 15:52.771
"Detectives made inquiries from holiday

16:52.165 --> 16:56.201
Any man jack who fails
to realize that...

16:56.269 --> 16:58.237
Had better don his think cap.

17:00.173 --> 17:03.742
Common zen savvy tells us...

17:03.809 --> 17:07.279
That the prestige
of the british automobile...

17:08.513 --> 17:10.949
Is being
severely threatened...

17:11.017 --> 17:14.286
By the encroachment
of the small...

17:14.354 --> 17:16.288
Or mini-car image.

17:17.924 --> 17:21.826
We are rapidly becoming
a tiny-car nation.

17:21.895 --> 17:26.765
So does it not follow then...

17:26.832 --> 17:29.734
That a nation of tiny cars...

17:29.802 --> 17:33.305
Could very soon become
a nation of tiny persons?

17:35.875 --> 17:39.678
<i>So, patently then,</i>

17:39.745 --> 17:42.547
it is in the highest
national interest...

17:42.615 --> 17:45.216
That we... counter...

17:45.284 --> 17:49.420
<i>This tiny car image...</i>

17:49.488 --> 17:52.591
By introducing an automobile...

17:52.658 --> 17:56.094
That will hold its own
size-wise...

17:56.161 --> 17:58.362
Against the american
big boys,

17:58.430 --> 18:02.200
<i>brilliant. Brilliant. Yet

18:29.929 --> 18:32.981
The british zeus!

18:35.901 --> 18:41.406
Designed for the man in the
know, the man on the go.

18:41.474 --> 18:44.759
And wherever he goes,

18:44.827 --> 18:48.763
he can accommodate a bevy of
personal friends and acquaintances.

18:48.831 --> 18:53.167
Let's think salesmanship

Performance.

19:05.347 --> 19:08.082

19:15.775 --> 19:18.677
Hampton, try that again
with an american accent.

19:19.745 --> 19:21.946
That was
an american accent, sir.

19:22.014 --> 19:24.616
Good lord.

19:24.684 --> 19:27.118
What's going on over there?

19:29.621 --> 19:31.622
Maltravers.

19:31.691 --> 19:37.079
Uh, getting the feel
of this big baby,

19:37.146 --> 19:40.682
- mm.
- Has been one...

19:40.749 --> 19:44.219
Grand thrill,
believe you me.

19:45.504 --> 19:47.456
<i>Hmm.</i>

19:51.961 --> 19:54.629
Hmm.

19:54.697 --> 19:57.499
Best sleep on it, eh?

19:57.567 --> 20:00.268
Never one to overextend.

20:12.949 --> 20:15.750
Gentlemen, as you know,

20:17.920 --> 20:21.089
The family tree
over a certain...

20:21.156 --> 20:24.893
Grand guy--
guy grand--

20:24.961 --> 20:27.328
has borne no fruit.

20:29.599 --> 20:34.168
The stoutiest efforts
by my sisters and i,

20:34.236 --> 20:37.138
quite independently,
of course,

20:37.206 --> 20:41.042
has not yielded grand progeny.

20:42.712 --> 20:45.313
By good luck however,

20:45.380 --> 20:48.817
one, perhaps two soiree ago,

20:51.153 --> 20:54.055
i chanced upon
a likely lad.

20:56.358 --> 20:58.727
And, gentlemen,

20:58.794 --> 21:03.665
may i tell you it was your
proverbial love at first sight.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.667
Paternal, of course.

21:09.238 --> 21:11.006
So, gentlemen,

21:11.073 --> 21:13.842
it is with great pride
and pleasure...

21:13.909 --> 21:16.511
That i introduce you now...

21:16.578 --> 21:19.547
To my only son and "proge,"

21:19.615 --> 21:23.317
master youngman grand, esq.

21:25.821 --> 21:27.756
Hello.

21:27.823 --> 21:29.758
¶ For he's a jolly
grand fellow ¶

21:29.825 --> 21:32.527
¶ for he's a jolly
grand fellow ¶

21:32.594 --> 21:36.497
¶ for he's a jolly
grand fellow ¶

21:36.565 --> 21:38.733
¶ and so say all of us

21:38.801 --> 21:42.904
thank you, thank you, thank you. You're
damned good lads, the lot of you.

21:42.972 --> 21:46.708
- You too, guy.
- Yes, thank you.

21:46.776 --> 21:48.843
And you're thinking men
as well,

21:48.911 --> 21:51.780
if memory serves.

21:51.847 --> 21:55.183
Unfortunately, that fact
is not always reflected...

21:55.250 --> 21:57.986
In our, uh,
quarterly reports.

21:59.689 --> 22:02.023
<i>Anyway, gentlemen,</i>
<i>may i take a page...</i>

22:02.091 --> 22:05.727
From our own late, great
rudy the kip kipling?

22:07.763 --> 22:09.698
Let our kipling speak.

22:12.735 --> 22:15.403
"There was a young lady
from exeter...

22:15.470 --> 22:17.672
<i>"And all the young men...</i>

22:17.740 --> 22:21.242
"Threw their sex at her.

22:21.310 --> 22:24.679
"Just to be rude,
she lay in the nude...

22:26.182 --> 22:28.683
"While her parrot,
the pervert,

22:28.751 --> 22:31.552
took pecks at her."

22:35.390 --> 22:39.493
Gentlemen, my man jeff
has your envelopes.

22:39.561 --> 22:43.031
<i>Please do not open them</i>
<i>until you are outside.</i>

22:43.099 --> 22:47.836
Inside you will find
a month's generous remuneration,

22:47.903 --> 22:51.572
a map containing a clue
as to your present whereabouts,

22:51.640 --> 22:54.475
<i>and a set</i>
<i>of day-glo references...</i>

22:54.543 --> 22:58.213
<i>To present to your</i>
<i>next lucky employer.</i>

22:58.280 --> 23:02.951
Leave your flowers and your pencils
on the table as you go, would you?

23:05.221 --> 23:07.388
Lord hampton?
Lord hampton?

23:07.456 --> 23:10.291
Lord hampton?

23:10.843 --> 23:14.345
Milk or lemon, esther?
Both, please.

23:14.413 --> 23:17.748
Hello, dears.
Ah, there you are, guy.

23:17.817 --> 23:21.319
Oh, angel's passing.
Guy, guy, always on the go.

23:21.386 --> 23:24.755
We're just having tea, darling.
You will join us?

23:24.824 --> 23:26.757
Now you will take tea,
youngman?

23:26.826 --> 23:29.894
This is bloody north america.
What's yours? I don't know.

23:29.961 --> 23:32.897
I've been fired before,
but never in afghanistan.

23:32.964 --> 23:36.668
Scone, guy? I-i-i
think not, darling.

23:36.735 --> 23:38.936
Hello, family grand!

23:39.004 --> 23:42.740
Just in time for tea.
I say, my good man.

23:42.808 --> 23:45.777
All right, mate. One at a time.
One at a time.

23:45.844 --> 23:48.446
Ginger, how are you?

23:48.514 --> 23:51.382
I think i rather fancy
a hot dog.

23:51.450 --> 23:54.619
Bitsy, say hello to guy.
Say hello to everyone.

23:54.687 --> 23:58.923
Hello, agnes. Hello, esther.
Say hello.

23:58.990 --> 24:02.126
Ginger, this is guy's new
son, youngman grand. Oh.

24:02.194 --> 24:04.562
- Pleased to meet you.
- This is my little bitsy.

24:04.630 --> 24:07.498
- Hello, bitsy.
- What do you want, guy?

24:07.566 --> 24:11.035
Hot frankfurter, dear.
Guy, we don't have any.

24:11.102 --> 24:13.671
There is in fact a friendly
hot dog vendor...

24:13.739 --> 24:16.307
Who solicits from
this very platform.

24:16.375 --> 24:18.359
Look, lass, do you want it
or don't you?

24:18.427 --> 24:20.728
I don't know.
Go ask the station master.

24:20.796 --> 24:24.215
What can this be?
"Silky.

24:24.282 --> 24:28.653
Through the use of infant head oils--"
that's one of our new acquisitions.

24:28.721 --> 24:33.725
Silky. As it says here, it is unconditionally
guaranteed to make your hair...

24:33.792 --> 24:37.495
Softer than that
of your own darling child.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.832
It's remarkable stuff. Why don't
you try some? Yes, i will.

24:40.899 --> 24:42.834
Try it, ginger. Try it.
Thank you.

24:44.302 --> 24:46.738
Righto, mate.
Now what do you want?

24:46.805 --> 24:50.541
I'd like a hot doggy,
please, my good man.

24:50.609 --> 24:52.577
Oh, you'd like
hot doggy, would you?

24:52.644 --> 24:55.913
Yeah. <i>Right. One hot
doggy you shall "havey."</i>

24:55.981 --> 25:01.002
- Ah, my second world war nazi atrocity book came at last.
-  - <i>good heavens.</i>

25:01.069 --> 25:04.172
Do you know
what bitsy and i do?

25:04.240 --> 25:09.693
We sit down and imagine all those
atrocities being done to the sex criminals.

25:09.762 --> 25:12.263
Yes, sex criminals
and the like.

25:12.330 --> 25:14.799
And that dr. Thorndike.

25:14.867 --> 25:18.602
What's that, ginge? Bill
thorndike, a sexy criminal?

25:18.670 --> 25:21.773
The man you sent me to,
he behaved very strangely.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.675
I say, hot doggy.
Do you want some onions?

25:24.743 --> 25:26.911
Are you calling me?
<i>Do you want some onions?</i>

25:26.979 --> 25:30.314
Oh, i love onions.
Absolutely love them.

25:30.382 --> 25:33.651
- Do you want some h.P. Or mustard?
- Uh, neither. Thank you.

25:33.718 --> 25:35.953
<i>That'll be nine pence.</i>
<i>Nine pence?</i>

25:36.021 --> 25:39.123
Nine pence.
Ah.

25:39.190 --> 25:41.492
Now don't you go away,
vendor.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.695
I shall be back with nine english pence.
Hey! Hey!

25:44.763 --> 25:48.032
Before he said another word and while
my head was still leaning back,

25:48.099 --> 25:50.334
he dropped a raw egg
into my mouth.

25:50.402 --> 25:53.003
Come on. Get a move on.
There we are, lad.

25:53.071 --> 25:57.442
What's this, a fiver? I can't
change a bleedin' fiver!

25:58.561 --> 26:00.795
Are you quite sure
this was an egg?

26:00.863 --> 26:04.632
Come on then. The train's on the move.
I can't change this fiver.

26:04.700 --> 26:09.671
- Come on. I ain't got all day.
- I say, no tricks now.

26:09.738 --> 26:13.040
This train's on the move. I want my change.
I can't change a fiver.

26:13.108 --> 26:16.744
And then do you know what he did?
No. What?

26:16.812 --> 26:21.048
He got a huge slab
of wet, greasy bacon...

26:21.116 --> 26:23.050
And wrapped it
'round my head.

26:25.971 --> 26:29.740
- Here, you better have this.
- What's this? A bloody tenner!

26:29.808 --> 26:33.294
I can't change a bloody tenner! Well,
you better have this doggy back.

26:33.729 --> 26:36.413
I'm not having that back.
You've been noshing it.

26:36.481 --> 26:39.951
- Hold on. Son. Case.
- <i>Dad? Case.</i>

26:40.018 --> 26:42.453
Quickly.

26:42.521 --> 26:46.741
- <i>I think we're onto</i>
<i>something here.</i>

26:59.571 --> 27:02.439
You're certainly putting
everybody on today, dad.

27:02.508 --> 27:06.577
Well, you know, youngman, sometimes
it's not enough merely to teach.

27:06.645 --> 27:08.613
One has to punish as well.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.149
A little bit of the old pause.
Cause for pause.

27:12.217 --> 27:15.452
Yes. I say,

27:15.521 --> 27:19.507
mark that person
of irritable mien.

27:19.575 --> 27:23.344
He's made a million
out of man's inhumanity to man.

27:23.411 --> 27:27.381
Salt of the earth.
Yes, salt of the earth.

27:27.449 --> 27:31.853
Perhaps together we can restore
his faith in the mystery of life.

27:41.997 --> 27:45.833
For god's sake, close the door.
There's a bloody draft.

28:40.005 --> 28:43.408
A big hand
for our special guest!

28:43.725 --> 28:46.277
¶

29:16.542 --> 29:18.926
¶

29:19.094 --> 29:22.080
Guard! Guard.

29:22.147 --> 29:26.584
Yes, sir? There's something
bloody weird going on in here.

29:26.651 --> 29:29.253
I've been driving
on this line for 40 years--

29:29.321 --> 29:31.622
very interesting.
Your papers, please!

29:31.690 --> 29:35.259
A few questions, please!

29:35.327 --> 29:37.395
Please! Please!

29:40.966 --> 29:44.502
Auchengillan. Auchengillan.

29:44.569 --> 29:47.605
Auchengillan. Auchengillan.

29:54.813 --> 29:56.981
This is auchengillan.

29:59.051 --> 30:01.486
Come on.

30:01.553 --> 30:03.488
Out you come.

30:06.058 --> 30:08.826
Is that ginger?
What happened to her hair?

30:08.894 --> 30:13.197
She's tried the silky.
It's the price of vanity.

30:13.265 --> 30:15.566
These are strange times
we live in, son. Yes.

30:15.634 --> 30:18.269
Each of us does our best.
Who can say more?

30:20.039 --> 30:21.321
But, guy.
Yes, dear.

30:21.389 --> 30:24.358
Youngman might
want to get married.

30:24.425 --> 30:28.029
I was wondering if we could help. Surely
there must be something we could do.

30:28.096 --> 30:31.899
I don't see any reason why you shouldn't.
Henry! Grand to see you, guy.

30:31.967 --> 30:34.301
Agnes. Esther.
Henry.

30:34.369 --> 30:36.303
This the boy?
This is the boy.

30:36.371 --> 30:38.372
Youngman,
prince renskeer.

30:38.439 --> 30:40.607
Hello, prince. Hello, youngman.
Come for the shoot?

30:40.676 --> 30:43.210
Yes. Well, come on. Let's
tend to the baggage.

30:43.278 --> 30:46.897
Right, right, right. Careful. These
country roads can be dangerous.

30:52.404 --> 30:54.838
Oh, here come the fuzz.

30:54.906 --> 30:58.876
What on earth do they want?
Could be routine or...

30:58.944 --> 31:01.579
Mere damnable harassment.

31:04.115 --> 31:06.050
Sir guy.

31:06.117 --> 31:08.619
Hello, corporal.

31:08.687 --> 31:12.356
I'm sorry to detain you, sir guy, but h.Q.
Said it might be important.

31:12.424 --> 31:14.358
Oh, well.
Let's see, shall we?

31:18.029 --> 31:21.031
Yeah, i say. Thank you very much, corporal.
Thank you very much.

31:24.236 --> 31:26.870
Yes, corporal?
Any answer, sir guy?

31:26.938 --> 31:30.274
Uh, there we are, corporal.

31:30.342 --> 31:33.444
And good night.
Good night, sir guy.

31:39.735 --> 31:42.503
Fine clean kill. Damn fine
morning for a shooting.

31:42.571 --> 31:45.606
- Bloody fine.
-  It's a good clean kill, eh, dad?

31:45.674 --> 31:48.876
Damned keen, guy,
isn't he?

31:48.943 --> 31:52.246
Bloody keen. Damn fine chap too.
He's bloody keen too.

31:52.313 --> 31:55.048
Not like that palfrey.

31:55.116 --> 31:58.452
I invite him to one of my shoots
and he shot a runner.

31:58.520 --> 32:02.022
- No!
- Yes. Saw it with me own eyes.

32:02.090 --> 32:04.091
Poor little thing
was trying to escape.

32:04.158 --> 32:07.261
Chaps these days have no sense
of bloody sportsmanship.

32:07.328 --> 32:11.098
- Damn them fellas!
- The old values are crumblin'.

32:11.166 --> 32:14.969
Old value? What on earth is
that gun you've got there?

32:15.036 --> 32:17.872
This is a 24 over and under.

32:17.939 --> 32:21.308
It's a sporty little item, but, uh,
personally i prefer a 12-bore.

32:21.376 --> 32:24.478
I don't mind missing
one or two pheasants,

32:24.545 --> 32:28.282
provided i can occasionally
get a quick kill.

32:28.349 --> 32:30.584
Aye, quick kill,
that's the name of the game.

32:30.652 --> 32:33.620
Dispatch the little
buggers quickly, eh? Yes.

32:53.491 --> 32:56.293
<i>Look! The dogs</i>
<i>are on point, guy.</i>

32:56.361 --> 32:59.079
Yes, so they are, lionel.
So they are.

32:59.147 --> 33:03.684
<i>Still in all, i don't fancy
relying entirely on dogs, do you?</i>

33:03.752 --> 33:05.953
Hey, what--

33:07.706 --> 33:10.624
hit the deck!

33:10.692 --> 33:12.810
Now for a good clean kill.

33:15.163 --> 33:17.415
Blast! Missed.

33:17.749 --> 33:20.334
Over to you,
red leader one.

33:25.691 --> 33:28.843
For god sakes, guy,
what's going on?

33:28.910 --> 33:33.030
In god's name,
stop it!

33:33.098 --> 33:35.633
<i>Yes. Good shooting,</i>
<i>red leader one.</i>

33:35.701 --> 33:37.702
<i>A direct hit.</i>

33:40.071 --> 33:42.773
Good god!

33:42.841 --> 33:46.177
<i>Nothing like a good,</i>
<i>clean kill, eh, henry?</i>

33:46.228 --> 33:49.263
Your bird, sir guy.

33:49.331 --> 33:53.301
It is the bestest shooting i've
seen in 30 years of service.

34:03.060 --> 34:05.496
Oh, bloody hell!

34:18.275 --> 34:20.377
Well, this is your
new home, youngman.

34:20.445 --> 34:22.413
Isn't it marvelous?

34:22.480 --> 34:25.266
It's perfectly lovely.
Good morning.

34:25.333 --> 34:29.203
Good morning.
It's really fantastic.

34:29.271 --> 34:32.773
I can't believe it. That big
clock, is that yours as well?

34:33.908 --> 34:35.842
Oh, i'm gonna have
a good time here.

34:35.909 --> 34:38.079
I can kind of feel it
in me bones.

34:49.456 --> 34:51.658
The staff are assembled.
Are these all ours?

34:51.726 --> 34:54.728
¶ Welcome, welcome

35:05.340 --> 35:09.009
they've been practicin'.
Marvelous. Come along.

35:09.077 --> 35:12.779
Oh, excellent, excellent. Excellent.
This is saul.

35:12.847 --> 35:16.483
Welcome.
And his fiancee claymont.

35:16.551 --> 35:18.986
And over here we have
mrs. Heatherington.

35:19.054 --> 35:21.354
Angela.

35:21.422 --> 35:24.391
Martha. Mary.

35:24.459 --> 35:26.460
Anaizby, sir.
Anaizby.

35:26.527 --> 35:29.930
Withers.
Withers. Fran. Beverly.

35:29.998 --> 35:32.967
- And if memory serves--
- norris, sir.

35:33.034 --> 35:35.268
Norris, the head gardener.
Hello, norris.

35:35.336 --> 35:39.406
Ladies and gentlemen, may i introduce
you to my new son youngman.

35:39.474 --> 35:42.593
¶

36:27.990 --> 36:29.923
Dad?

36:29.992 --> 36:32.626
Hmm?
Do you think words corrupt?

36:32.694 --> 36:35.396
I don't know.

36:35.464 --> 36:37.498
But let's try.

36:37.565 --> 36:39.500
Agnes?
Yes?

36:39.567 --> 36:41.602
- Nipple.
- Shh.

36:41.669 --> 36:45.239
Well, there's no immediate
physical change.

36:45.307 --> 36:47.841
I don't really think
words corrupt. No?

36:47.909 --> 36:51.345
But they keep prosecuting these people
for selling pornographic books.

36:51.413 --> 36:53.580
Hmm.
Why don't we write...

36:53.648 --> 36:56.083
A dirty, filthy
pornographic book...

36:56.151 --> 37:00.921
And then print it leaving blanks
where the dirty words were? Yes.

37:00.989 --> 37:03.857
And then people could write
what they wanted themselves.

37:03.925 --> 37:08.562
It'd be much more exciting.
Yes, and much more creative.

37:08.630 --> 37:10.964
How about this?

37:11.032 --> 37:14.935
Pounding with desire,
lord peter ripped open her--

37:15.003 --> 37:18.839
Revealing her--

37:18.907 --> 37:22.610
and leaned forward
and-- her.

37:22.677 --> 37:25.245
Brilliant, youngman, but why
leave it at pornography?

37:25.313 --> 37:27.247
What about the bible?
The bible?

37:27.315 --> 37:31.419
Yes, the bible. Ladies and
gentlemen, presenting the good book.

37:31.486 --> 37:34.354
¶ Can you make it better

37:34.423 --> 37:36.757
groove with your
space commander, dad.

37:39.895 --> 37:44.865
This is michael barrett reporting
from the famous cruft's dog show...

37:44.933 --> 37:48.151
And here's mr. Umbongo
just after the incident.

37:58.830 --> 38:01.965
A new breed of dog--
if in fact it was a dog--

38:02.033 --> 38:06.904
made a spectacularly unfortunate debut
at the show when it opened here today.

38:06.971 --> 38:11.641
The enduring question was the
so-called congo black dog known as,

38:11.710 --> 38:14.678
or registered anyway,
as "big fang."

38:14.746 --> 38:17.948
And it's a curious
catlike creature.

38:18.016 --> 38:22.552
Today covered in a poodle-type coat
which almost obscured its face.

38:22.620 --> 38:28.525
When its owner, mr. Umbongo from masawa
in west africa took it into the arena,

38:28.593 --> 38:31.228
the beast went
absolutely berserk.

38:31.295 --> 38:33.597
It ferociously attacked
the other entries.

38:33.664 --> 38:37.567
There was devastation. There was
havoc, near panic in the galleries.

38:37.736 --> 38:41.021
And it's reported that
the dog was actually eating...

38:41.089 --> 38:44.191
An unspecified number
of its fellow entries.

38:44.259 --> 38:47.394
This is michael barrett
returning you to the studio.

38:47.462 --> 38:49.896
<i>Oh, so dreadful, guy!</i>
<i>Switch it over.</i>

38:51.766 --> 38:54.168
That's better.

38:55.770 --> 39:00.073
I can't imagine how a thing like
that could happen at cruft's.

39:06.664 --> 39:10.167
A direct hit on st. Pete's, dad.
Good, good.

39:10.235 --> 39:12.736
<i>Good, youngman, good. Cook can't
do anything with the grouse, guy.</i>

39:12.804 --> 39:15.038
She says they're burnt
to a cinder.

39:15.106 --> 39:17.591
Incompetence in the kitchen,
eh, sister?

39:17.659 --> 39:20.327
Guy? Guy?

39:20.395 --> 39:23.164
Cook said they were like that when she
opened the game bag. Carry on, youngman.

39:23.231 --> 39:25.166
All ashes and bones.

39:25.233 --> 39:28.135
Ashes and bones in the game bag? Ho-ho.
I don't like the sound of that.

39:28.203 --> 39:31.588
- <i>Eh, youngman?</i>
<i>- Me neither, dad.</i>

39:31.656 --> 39:35.225
There. Guy, we simply must
eat because i'm starving.

39:35.293 --> 39:37.227
Now come along.
What? What?

39:37.295 --> 39:40.831
- <i>I'm starving.</i>
<i>- The whole world's starving.</i>

39:43.067 --> 39:47.203
<i>Well, look here, sister.</i>
<i>Let me say if-- if cook...</i>

39:47.271 --> 39:49.706
Has in fact spoiled
our table bird,

39:49.774 --> 39:52.075
why don't we all go down
to chez eduard.

39:52.143 --> 39:55.512
<i>Where, if memory serves,</i>

39:55.580 --> 39:59.683
an honest working man can still
get a good lancashire hot pot.

39:59.751 --> 40:03.520
Chez eduard's such fun.
That's a splendid idea.

40:03.588 --> 40:05.756
Can't we settle
our differences amicably?

40:05.824 --> 40:10.928
No, son. No. Not while there's
a cathedral standing.

40:23.441 --> 40:25.475
Yoo-hoo.

40:25.543 --> 40:28.879
Good evening, sir guy.

40:28.947 --> 40:31.448
Good evening, sir guy.
Everything is arranged for you.

40:31.515 --> 40:33.984
Good, good. Sir guy, you
do me a great honor.

40:34.052 --> 40:35.986
Eduard.
Nonsense, nonsense.

40:36.054 --> 40:39.857
I've been imposing myself for one of your
gastronomic experiences for some time.

40:39.924 --> 40:42.392
- Waiter.
- Everything is prepared as you ordered.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.962
Good, good. Then i suggest
we waste no more time.

40:45.029 --> 40:47.464
Guy, aren't you dining
with us?

40:47.531 --> 40:50.633
No, dear agnes, no. When
the gourmet mood is on me,

40:50.701 --> 40:53.003
my needs must dine alone.

40:53.071 --> 40:56.874
You remember charles, sir guy?
Charles, charles.

40:56.941 --> 41:00.577
The aden offensive,
was it not?

41:02.580 --> 41:05.115
Give us one of the old ones,
charles. I love the old ones.

41:05.183 --> 41:08.485
May i suggest the <i>pour
commencer, c'est ce pas</i> caviar?

41:08.552 --> 41:10.854
The caviar, yes.
Beluga, of course.

41:10.922 --> 41:13.257
<i>Certainmente.</i>
<i>Beluga.</i>

41:18.263 --> 41:21.098
It's very interesting,
eduard.

41:21.165 --> 41:23.867
But tonight i fancy...

41:23.935 --> 41:28.372
Putting your <i>canard</i>
<i>a l'orange</i> to the test.

41:28.439 --> 41:31.141
You have heard. It is
the <i>canard a l'orange.</i>

41:38.783 --> 41:41.285
Uh, sommelier, yes.

41:41.352 --> 41:43.954
Yes, that'll do very nicely.

41:44.022 --> 41:47.824
Sir guy grand.
Last of the great gourmets.

41:51.562 --> 41:55.132
Do you approve
of the wine, sir guy?

41:55.199 --> 41:59.303
The cork is '47. Is the
wine <i>aussi, sir guy?</i>

41:59.370 --> 42:01.305
A rare combination.

42:09.680 --> 42:14.551
This plucky little burgundy has got
my juices a flowing. Merci, sir guy.

42:19.057 --> 42:21.425
Extraordinaire.

42:26.630 --> 42:29.766
With ministry of transport,
sixty pence.

42:29.834 --> 42:33.370
Oh, another first
for england.

42:36.507 --> 42:38.741
That's better.

42:41.145 --> 42:44.781
God almighty, what's going
on here? Waiter!

42:47.918 --> 42:49.853
You know, eduard,

42:51.389 --> 42:53.323
the odd thing
about caviar...

42:53.391 --> 42:55.892
<i>Is that one never</i>
<i>gets enough toast.</i>

42:55.960 --> 42:59.296
Toast, sir guy? No, thank you.
I never touch it.

43:02.867 --> 43:05.602
Mm-hmm.
The chopped egg.

43:15.613 --> 43:18.715
Where a fish
is a sturgeon,

43:18.782 --> 43:22.319
this can only come
from a virgin.

43:36.767 --> 43:38.701
Mmm!

43:47.145 --> 43:49.246
Yes, it is '47.

43:54.618 --> 43:56.186
Excellent.

43:56.254 --> 43:59.289
Yes, thank you.
This is the <i>canard.</i>

44:01.692 --> 44:03.626
Yes, i love it.

44:09.734 --> 44:12.869
Yes, i must speak
with the chef.

44:12.937 --> 44:16.272
I must speak
with the chef.

44:16.340 --> 44:19.976
<i>Mon compliments a chef!</i>
<i>Mon compliments a chef!</i>

44:24.148 --> 44:27.283
That's the last we shall
see of him tonight.

44:27.351 --> 44:29.786
¶

44:31.488 --> 44:35.525
Gentlemen, a big hand
for a good loser.

44:40.865 --> 44:43.700
But, guy, i thought you said it
was to be a soiree musicale.

44:46.104 --> 44:48.338
Hold it, tiger.

44:48.405 --> 44:50.941
Big smile.

44:51.242 --> 44:55.061
It's the championship, aunt agnes.
Ike jones and joe thompson.

44:55.530 --> 44:58.081
¶

45:09.344 --> 45:13.813
Challenger joe thompson has just climbed
into the ring looking very fit.

45:13.882 --> 45:17.734
Very fit indeed. And getting
a warm round of applause...

45:17.802 --> 45:19.836
From this fine sporting crowd
here tonight.

45:19.904 --> 45:23.974
All of them asking themselves Can
the challenger deliver his punch?

45:24.275 --> 45:26.760
You know he's got it,
but can he deliver it?

45:26.828 --> 45:29.396
Will he stay conscious
long enough to deliver it?

45:29.463 --> 45:31.565
Good evening, milady.
Hello.

45:34.468 --> 45:39.172
Ah, jeff, last of
the old bulldog breed, eh?

45:39.240 --> 45:43.410
And here he comes now, the heavyweight
champion of the world, ike jones.

45:47.898 --> 45:51.885
Just listen to the reception he's getting.
Just listen to this crowd.

45:58.392 --> 46:02.963
Let's have a look at the record
of these two rugged customers.

46:03.031 --> 46:07.868
I have reason to believe this may
be an exceptional bout. Yes.

46:07.936 --> 46:11.371
Jones may be strong, granted.
But in my opinion,

46:11.439 --> 46:14.641
<i>joe thompson could easily be
that much too nimble for him.</i>

46:14.709 --> 46:16.643
Eh, jeff?
Certainly, sir.

46:16.711 --> 46:19.346
Well, both these men
mount the ring...

46:19.414 --> 46:22.065
With very impressive records
behind them.

46:22.133 --> 46:27.170
The champion has been unbeaten
in a total of 78 bouts.

46:27.238 --> 46:29.205
He's never been knocked out.

46:29.273 --> 46:32.175
In fact, he's never even
been knocked off his feet.

46:32.242 --> 46:35.445
But he has had to take plenty of
punishment from time to time.

46:35.512 --> 46:39.015
Ike jones is certainly not hiding
behind the door, as they say,

46:39.083 --> 46:42.418
when fighting heart
and guts was being handed out.

46:44.021 --> 46:48.925
My lords, ladies
and gentlemen,

46:48.993 --> 46:50.961
this is the main event...

46:51.028 --> 46:53.129
Of the evening.

46:53.197 --> 46:55.565
Fifteen rounds of boxing...

46:55.633 --> 46:58.585
For the heavyweight
championship...

46:58.652 --> 47:00.587
Of the world...

47:00.654 --> 47:03.857
Between and
presenting to you...

47:03.925 --> 47:07.594
In this corner
from battersea, london,

47:07.661 --> 47:12.099
the british and british
empire champion,

47:12.166 --> 47:14.300
john thompson.

47:22.309 --> 47:27.080
And with pleasure, for the
first time in great britain,

47:27.148 --> 47:30.851
from detroit,
united states of america,

47:30.918 --> 47:34.587
the heavyweight champion
of the world,

47:34.655 --> 47:37.224
ike jones!

47:39.493 --> 47:43.230
Fighters move to the center of the ring. They're
getting final instructions from the referee.

47:43.297 --> 47:45.899
Both fighters looking confident
and relaxed.

47:45.967 --> 47:50.053
And the crowd here at this arena settles
back for what promises to be...

47:50.121 --> 47:52.421
A very hard and lively scrap...

47:52.489 --> 47:55.358
Between these two giants.

47:55.425 --> 47:58.845
Now they've returned to their
corners and we wait for the bell.

48:00.648 --> 48:02.598
Hit him straight
in the eye.

48:20.201 --> 48:24.037
Our first round of this brutal
match for the heavyweight crown.

48:24.105 --> 48:27.874
Both boys circling each other now carefully.
Each measuring his man.

48:27.942 --> 48:31.912
Showing due respect for the lethal
power in the gloves of the opponent.

48:31.979 --> 48:33.947
You're too much.

48:35.917 --> 48:38.185
<i>Come on then.</i>

48:44.826 --> 48:48.094
One, two,

48:48.162 --> 48:51.965
guy, those men are absurd. I thought
they were just good friends.

48:54.101 --> 48:57.553
The crowd seem
to be sickened...

48:57.621 --> 49:00.824
By the sight of no blood.

49:03.310 --> 49:06.980
There they are, son.
The dark blues.

49:07.047 --> 49:12.102
The oxford crew. Stout hearts, the lot.
Where are they going, dad?

49:12.169 --> 49:14.771
<i>Nowhere in particular.</i>
<i>Back and forth.</i>

49:14.839 --> 49:17.440
<i>Back and forth.</i>
<i>Working out.</i>

49:17.775 --> 49:20.026
Honing the edge,
if one may dare to coin.

49:20.094 --> 49:24.214
<i>They're practicing for the big
race with the cambridge eight.</i>

49:24.281 --> 49:27.683
<i>That'll be our man, son. We'll
be wanting a word with him.</i>

49:27.751 --> 49:30.853
¶ If you want it here
it is come and get it ¶

49:32.523 --> 49:36.292
¶ make your mind up fast

49:36.360 --> 49:40.863
¶ if you want it
anytime i can give it ¶

49:40.931 --> 49:45.151
¶ but you better hurry
'cause it may not last ¶

49:47.221 --> 49:52.225
¶ Did i hear you say
that there must be a catch ¶

49:52.292 --> 49:56.229
¶ will you walk away
from a fool and his money ¶

49:56.296 --> 49:58.231
step inside.

50:07.925 --> 50:11.294
Well, that much is done.
Done and double done.

50:11.361 --> 50:13.763
Bit surprised he went
for it, actually.

50:13.831 --> 50:17.333
I mean, the race being such a
traditional thing and all that.

50:17.401 --> 50:20.170
Well, son, as you proceed
along the great road of life,

50:20.237 --> 50:24.507
sometimes referred to as the "yellow
brick road," you'll find that the--

50:24.574 --> 50:26.509
aha.

50:31.715 --> 50:35.151
<i>I say, what's</i>
<i>all this about?</i>

50:35.219 --> 50:38.354
What do you make of this, son?
What do you think this is?

50:38.422 --> 50:41.191
Looks like an advert?
"What's it all about?"

50:41.258 --> 50:45.528
Yes. This car is parked
in a loading zone.

50:47.081 --> 50:50.016
And it's lucky for you it wasn't
towed away for that matter.

50:50.084 --> 50:52.218
What is this thing?
What is it?

50:52.286 --> 50:55.354
Now that-- that happens
to be a parking ticket...

50:55.422 --> 50:57.757
That i've issued to you
for the violation.

50:57.825 --> 51:00.426
But my son thought it was
an advert, didn't you?

51:00.494 --> 51:02.428
What? I thought
it was an advert.

51:02.496 --> 51:05.164
Yes, i can't see
the point of it myself.

51:05.232 --> 51:09.135
I really can't see
the point at all.

51:09.203 --> 51:11.571
The point is that
you are in violation.

51:11.639 --> 51:13.773
You violated
the traffic rule...

51:13.841 --> 51:16.676
Get out of it!

51:16.744 --> 51:18.678
By parking your car
in a loading zone.

51:18.746 --> 51:21.180
That's what it's all about.
What do you mean loading zone?

51:21.248 --> 51:24.084
There's no loading
going on around here.

51:24.151 --> 51:27.621
What do you think these sods are doing
with them pressurized ferkins then?

51:27.688 --> 51:29.623
Tell me that then.

51:29.690 --> 51:32.425
Pressurized ferkins.
Ferkins.

51:32.493 --> 51:35.662
You know,
not many years ago,

51:35.730 --> 51:37.964
i can recall the day...

51:38.032 --> 51:42.102
When you could buy a decent pressurized
ferkin for a couple of pounds.

51:42.169 --> 51:44.037
Let go, sir.

51:44.105 --> 51:49.308
The whole thing is these sods aren't loading
pressurized ferkins. They're unloading.

51:49.376 --> 51:52.078
Constable, there's the rub.
There's no difference.

51:52.146 --> 51:54.614
There's no difference at all.
And don't call me constable.

51:54.682 --> 51:57.751
It's warden.
Not sergeant, warden.

51:57.818 --> 52:00.820
Well, then, are you trying
to tell me, sergeant warden,

52:00.888 --> 52:04.374
is there's no difference between
loading and unloading?

52:04.441 --> 52:07.894
What's he doin'? He looks like
a bleedin' nutcase to me.

52:07.961 --> 52:10.063
Why don't you get
your bleedin' hair cut?

52:10.131 --> 52:12.999
The silent scream.

52:13.067 --> 52:16.069
"Open your mouth and eyes
as wide as you can...

52:16.137 --> 52:20.073
"Stretching the muscles against the skin
and bones that hold the face together.

52:20.141 --> 52:23.810
Try to tear
your face apart."

52:23.878 --> 52:25.979
What's your game then?

52:26.047 --> 52:28.782
Uh, grand is the name.

52:28.849 --> 52:32.819
And, uh, money is the game.
Would you care to play?

52:32.887 --> 52:35.755
"Make it as tiny
as you can.

52:35.823 --> 52:38.391
Try and make your face
disappear."

52:38.458 --> 52:43.229
What's that you said then? Can you
see this facsimile of her majesty?

52:43.297 --> 52:47.000
God bless her. Just a minute.
What was that you said before?

52:47.068 --> 52:49.035
Oh, my suggestion is...

52:49.103 --> 52:52.772
That if you're prepared
to eat that parking ticket,

52:52.840 --> 52:57.376
i will give you £500 sterling
for eating it.

52:57.444 --> 53:02.015
What do you mean by that? What
do you mean, me eat that-that?

53:02.216 --> 53:06.252
It's quite simple. Just put the ticket,
my good fellow, into your mouth,

53:06.320 --> 53:10.690
chew it up and you swallow it,
and i give you this £500.

53:10.757 --> 53:14.594
- Just a bloody minute.
- "Number 12:

53:14.661 --> 53:17.864

53:17.932 --> 53:20.767
"Of the steering wheel and push
it with all your strength.

53:25.740 --> 53:28.290
<i>Silent scream.</i>
<i>Tiny face.</i>

53:28.359 --> 53:30.292
Yes, now listen.
Here--

53:30.361 --> 53:32.294
are you--
are you telling me...

53:32.363 --> 53:34.630
That you're-- you're willing
to give me 500 quid...

53:34.698 --> 53:37.700
Yes, to eat that ticket.
To-- to eat that ticket?

53:37.768 --> 53:40.470
It's what you might call a limited offer.
A limited offer.

53:40.537 --> 53:45.040
Expiring in, shall we say,
i don't know, ten seconds?

53:45.108 --> 53:47.042
Uh, give me that!

53:47.110 --> 53:49.579
Shall we say ten?
Yes.

53:49.646 --> 53:52.448
Start the countdown.
You can go as quick as you like.

53:52.516 --> 53:54.584
- Nine--
- eight--

three--

54:05.696 --> 54:09.231
- you needn't eat the plastic.
- It's all right. It's all right.

54:10.534 --> 54:12.568
I just wanted to see
if you had your price.

54:12.636 --> 54:15.772
Most of us do.

54:15.839 --> 54:19.675
Good luck, sir. I'm here--
i'm here every thursday.

54:33.990 --> 54:36.659
Let that be a lesson to you!

54:36.727 --> 54:39.396
¶

54:41.799 --> 54:43.867
What's the nature
of it, son?

54:43.934 --> 54:45.869
Something you can
share with your dad?

54:45.936 --> 54:50.106
"For the gracious few, a new

55:23.023 --> 55:24.924
I hope it keeps
fine for them.

55:24.992 --> 55:29.228
What do you think they mean by
"our criteria may not be yours"?

55:29.296 --> 55:33.499
It's to avoid offending people
who may not be quite top drawer.

55:33.567 --> 55:36.468
Oh, i see.
How thoughtful.

55:36.536 --> 55:39.438
Well, i know deborah and
simon applied this morning.

55:39.506 --> 55:41.774
I hope they won't be
too disappointed if, uh--

55:41.842 --> 55:45.111
well, not exactly
<i>who's who,</i> are they?

55:45.179 --> 55:49.082
Excuse me. Do you mean
deborah and simon devanger?

55:49.149 --> 55:51.718
Yes.
Ah, yes, terribly sweet.

55:51.785 --> 55:54.253
Frightfully nice people,
but hardly <i>burke's.</i>

55:54.321 --> 55:56.255
Hardly.

55:56.323 --> 56:00.459
I do think, that in my opinion the
maiden voyage of <i>the magic christian...</i>

56:00.527 --> 56:05.131
Could easily become
the social must of the season.

56:05.199 --> 56:08.101
Ladies and gentlemen,
the auction is about to start.

56:08.168 --> 56:10.103
Shall we go in?

56:11.805 --> 56:14.573
I've got a little work to do.
I'll see you later.

56:14.641 --> 56:16.575
I'll see you inside.

This is, uh, rembrandt,
is it not?

57:16.202 --> 57:19.071
Well, it may be.
It's not been authenticated.

57:19.139 --> 57:21.140
It's certainly
school of rembrandt.

57:21.207 --> 57:23.142
Hmm.

57:27.380 --> 57:30.015
It's most
frightfully dark.

57:30.083 --> 57:32.752
One can hardly make it
out at all.

57:35.689 --> 57:40.143
Well, he was a master of
light and shade, wasn't he?

57:40.210 --> 57:43.046
And it is a little old.

57:43.113 --> 57:46.983
Uh, excuse me,
mister, uh--

57:47.051 --> 57:49.585

Dougdale.

57:49.653 --> 57:53.622
Might i ask... the price of this
example of light and shade?

57:53.691 --> 57:56.159
It's being sold by auction,

57:56.226 --> 57:59.829
but we expect to get about,
uh, £10,000.

58:01.965 --> 58:05.134
I'd be prepared
to give you...

58:05.202 --> 58:07.136
Fifteen.

58:10.373 --> 58:12.308
Uh, excuse me.

58:13.376 --> 58:15.311
Uh, £15,000?

58:15.378 --> 58:17.313
Yes.

58:17.380 --> 58:20.917
See, well, i must assure you i've been
given instructions not to accept any--

58:20.984 --> 58:24.653
in that case, my final
offer would be 30.

58:28.826 --> 58:32.595
Th-thirty thousand pounds?
<i>Yes.</i>

58:32.662 --> 58:34.597
Shit.

58:34.664 --> 58:36.766
I do-- i really do
beg your pardon.

58:38.134 --> 58:40.503
Sir, it's a deal.

58:42.138 --> 58:44.106
Yes, good, good.

58:44.174 --> 58:47.810
I, uh-- i like school of rembrandt.
Saint rembrandt's high.

58:47.878 --> 58:50.012
Yes, i enjoy
all the french painters.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.215
Uh, well, rembrandt was, uh,
in a sense, dutch.

58:53.283 --> 58:57.219
- Although, he was much
influenced by the, uh-- - dutch?

58:57.287 --> 58:59.422
The dutch. Rembrandt.

58:59.490 --> 59:03.893
I don't like the, uh,
dutch painters.

59:06.764 --> 59:09.098
The only thing the dutch
could paint--

59:09.165 --> 59:11.801
Please.

59:11.869 --> 59:14.537
<i>Yes, please,</i>
<i>restrain yourself.</i>

59:16.006 --> 59:19.442
This is my painting.
I shall be paying you...

59:19.510 --> 59:23.946
<i>£30,000 for this</i>
<i>unauthenticated...</i>

59:24.014 --> 59:26.716
Copy of a french rembrandt.

59:31.354 --> 59:34.590
There.
That's a splendid nose.

59:34.658 --> 59:36.926
<i>Seventeenth century?</i>
<i>Easily.</i>

59:36.993 --> 59:40.262
<i>Excellent nose. Keep that.</i>
<i>You can burn the rest.</i>

59:40.330 --> 59:43.766
- Uh-- - yes, unless of
course you have any other...

59:43.834 --> 59:46.836
- French noses by van dyck or--
- no.

59:46.904 --> 59:49.539
Come, youngman.
Let's go and watch the auction.

59:49.606 --> 59:52.308
And keep your eye open
for a good ear.

59:56.212 --> 59:59.148

ladies and gentlemen.

"Dignity and impudence,"
by sir edward landseer.

01:00:08.258 --> 01:00:12.027
This is
a victorian genre picture.

01:00:12.095 --> 01:00:15.164
<i>These pictures,</i>
<i>not always appreciated,</i>

01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:19.469
<i>have now become to find a certain
favor among thecognoscenti.</i>

01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:24.774
No one back in baton rouge
owns a landseer. No, honey.

01:00:24.842 --> 01:00:30.212
- And the colors are just right for our conversation pens.
- This is a big one.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.315
Shall we start it
at £1,000?

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:37.019
See, mark the manner
of the others, youngman.

01:00:37.087 --> 01:00:40.656
Don't tip your hand.
That is the fool's game.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:44.126
Mm. Right.
<i>£3,000.</i>

01:00:44.194 --> 01:00:46.996
3,500 from
an outer gallery.

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:49.999

<i>- 4,500.</i>
<i>- ¶</i>

01:00:54.104 --> 01:00:57.840
5,000.

01:00:57.908 --> 01:01:03.513
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not the
usual practice of sotheby's...

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.581
To <i>encourage</i> bidding.

01:01:05.649 --> 01:01:08.217
But £5,000
for this fine landseer,

01:01:08.284 --> 01:01:12.555
executed at the height of the artist's
maturity, is really something--

01:01:12.623 --> 01:01:15.541
<i>Lord!</i>
<i>6,000.</i>

01:01:19.513 --> 01:01:22.881
- 6,500...
- He's lost control.

From an outer gallery.

01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:28.604

9,000.

01:01:36.013 --> 01:01:39.015

<i>16,000. 17,000. Let me through.
I'm trying to bid!</i>

01:01:48.158 --> 01:01:52.128
- 18,000.
- 18,500!

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:55.998
It's against you, sir.

01:01:56.066 --> 01:01:59.535
- No, i can't compete with these prices.
- <i>All right, herbert.</i>

01:01:59.602 --> 01:02:02.571
Mark it sold to the old
american twit in the front row.

01:02:02.639 --> 01:02:05.574
¶

01:02:18.956 --> 01:02:20.957
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:02:21.024 --> 01:02:24.260
and welcome to london for this
great and grand historical event--

01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:26.312
the oxford and cambridge
boat race.

01:02:26.379 --> 01:02:29.949
And, as i look at it now, it seems we've
got the most perfect weather overhead.

01:02:30.016 --> 01:02:32.868
They're wonderful conditions.
They really are. And, uh--

01:02:32.936 --> 01:02:34.904
cambridge eight
have just appeared.

01:02:34.972 --> 01:02:37.406
And we're waiting now for the
much-fancied oxford crew.

01:02:37.608 --> 01:02:40.443
Well, then, now break it up, chaps, will you?
Gather around.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.779
I, uh-- i'd like to
introduce sir guy grand...

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:46.849
And his son,
youngman grand.

01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:49.852
Sir guy's come down with a very
interesting proposition to us.

01:02:49.919 --> 01:02:53.322
- Sir guy.
- Lads, we, uh,

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.692
had a little idea
concerning the race.

01:02:56.759 --> 01:02:58.327
Yes.
Yes. Yes.

01:02:58.395 --> 01:03:01.430
An endeavor, you might say,
to make it somewhat more...

01:03:01.498 --> 01:03:04.700
<i>Interesting</i>
<i>this year.</i>

01:03:05.002 --> 01:03:07.720
Cambridge are making their way
to the starting position,

01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.821
but there's still
no sign of oxford.

01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:14.026
We're here, in fact, to make
you a very interesting offer.

01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:16.128
Of money.

01:03:16.196 --> 01:03:20.465
- I think they're trying to bribe us.
- They are.

01:03:20.934 --> 01:03:24.487
Oxford still haven't put in an appearance,
and the crowd's getting just a bit restive.

01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:28.857
It's really most extraordinary. I'm quite sure
the umpire's got something to say about this.

01:03:28.925 --> 01:03:30.859
Oxford,
can you hear me?

01:03:30.927 --> 01:03:34.063
You mean you've actually come here to offer
us money to interfere with the race?

01:03:34.131 --> 01:03:37.433
Yes,
that's right.

01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:40.802
I think you ought to leave.
You have the wrong men.

01:03:43.473 --> 01:03:46.008
But you must
leave immediately.

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:49.845
You should realize, sir, that
oxford men cannot be bought.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:52.348
<i>Hear! Hear!</i>
<i>Mm.</i>

01:03:52.416 --> 01:03:57.186
But, you see, we thought that
if the sum was large enough,

01:03:57.254 --> 01:04:00.489
as large as that.

01:04:00.557 --> 01:04:04.693
- Now, get a move on, please!
<i>- and here's oxford at last.</i>

01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:07.329
Well, i make them about--
about five minutes late.

01:04:07.397 --> 01:04:10.199
That's better.

01:04:10.267 --> 01:04:14.603
I think it is the first time in the history
of the race that any crew has been late.

01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:17.239
Get ready!

01:04:17.307 --> 01:04:19.508
Are you ready?

01:04:19.576 --> 01:04:22.878
- Row!
- <i>And now they're off. They're off to a good start.</i>

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.913
They're late,
but nevertheless underway,

01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:28.250
and despite a rather fresh head wind,
they're moving along rather nicely.

01:04:28.318 --> 01:04:31.954
Cambridge have settled down nicely.
Moving along tidily, sir john.

01:04:32.021 --> 01:04:34.022
Ah, yes.
Splendid. Splendid.

01:04:34.091 --> 01:04:36.792
The best i've seen since i
stroked them in '28. Oh?

01:04:36.859 --> 01:04:39.228
Yes. Before your time, of course.
Oh, of course.

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:41.230
Yes, of course,
yes.

01:04:41.298 --> 01:04:44.967
Now, both crews are rowing with almost
perfect style and lots of polish.

01:04:45.034 --> 01:04:47.936
But now as i look, cambridge
are putting up the stroke now.

01:04:48.004 --> 01:04:50.539
And as they shoot hammersmith
bridge, i make cambridge about--

01:04:50.607 --> 01:04:52.608
oh, i should say--
a good length ahead.

01:04:52.675 --> 01:04:55.611
The light blues are putting
up the stroke a bit, son.

01:04:55.678 --> 01:04:58.781
They're giving it ten. Mm,
you might be right, dad.

01:04:58.849 --> 01:05:01.217
What do you mean, "you might be right"?
They are giving out ten.

01:05:01.284 --> 01:05:05.788
Yes. Yes. You and i know they're giving out ten, john.
I was pointing it out to him.

01:05:05.856 --> 01:05:07.823
He's new to the game. Oh, i see.

01:05:11.694 --> 01:05:13.829
Why, is he entitled
to that cap?

01:05:13.897 --> 01:05:16.732
I mean to say, why is he wearing it?
To keep me head warm.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.169
Oh.
"Keep it warm."

01:05:20.237 --> 01:05:22.171
Yes.

01:05:23.573 --> 01:05:26.108
Now, at about half way
along the course,

01:05:26.176 --> 01:05:31.780
cambridge are still in the lead, and we'll just
see how oxford will respond to this challenge.

01:05:31.848 --> 01:05:36.852
Now, with these lads, it isn't win or lose or
draw that counts. It's simply playing the game.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.122
That's how it's been for 140
years over this boat race,

01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:42.758
and that's how it is today
on the thames here.

01:05:42.826 --> 01:05:45.694
And--

01:05:45.762 --> 01:05:48.597
good, god! What on earth's
going on, for heaven's sake?

01:05:48.799 --> 01:05:50.633
- <i>The bloody swine</i> <i>have cut their rudder line.
</i> <i>-</i> <i>Oxford!</i>

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.953
- <i>You're out of your water!
- It looks like a change in tactics for the dark blues.</i>

01:05:55.021 --> 01:05:57.973
<i>Hold on, son. Let's not</i>
<i>jump to conclusions.</i>

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:01.160
- They're gonna ram 'em amidship!
- Good god!

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:06.265
- <i>They've been practicin'.
- Yes. What do you make of it, john?</i>

01:06:06.332 --> 01:06:08.333
Well, it would've never have
happened in my day. Nor mine.

01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:12.104
- Well, it's happenin' in mine!
<i>- it seems the light blues...</i>

01:06:12.172 --> 01:06:15.641
Have lost their all too hastily
acquired polish, eh, son?

01:06:15.975 --> 01:06:17.859
And now the dark blues
are turning back.

01:06:17.927 --> 01:06:20.563
Good lads. They're going
back to lend a hand.

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:22.464
Looks like some kind
of a <i>punch up.</i>

01:06:22.532 --> 01:06:25.067
- <i>This leaves a very nasty</i> <i>taste in the mouth.
- </i> <i>- Yes, indeed.</i>

01:06:25.134 --> 01:06:29.071
Come here, john. Anything that leaves
a nasty taste in the mouth disgraces.

01:06:29.138 --> 01:06:34.843
What? John. Could you just--
for a quick photo together.

01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:38.414
Thank you. It's a disgrace.
The whole thing is a disgrace.

01:06:40.217 --> 01:06:41.867
Bloody students!

01:06:41.935 --> 01:06:44.402
What's going on there, umpire?
Infringement!

01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:46.672
Yes, umpire.
What's going on?

01:06:46.739 --> 01:06:49.875
What is it?

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:01.152
Hello, this is michael aspel,
and welcome once again to...

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.722
<i>Another edition of</i>
<i>people are talking about.</i>

01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:07.893
Well, these days--

01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:11.463
...is this fantastic new
dream ship, <i>the magic christian.</i>

01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:14.399
Now let's meet the man who's going to
be at the helm for her maiden voyage,

01:07:14.467 --> 01:07:16.434
captain reginald k. Klaus.

01:07:16.503 --> 01:07:18.937
Good afternoon, captain. How do you do?
How do you do?

01:07:19.005 --> 01:07:21.006
Sit yourself down.
Thank you very much.

01:07:21.073 --> 01:07:24.910
Uh-huh. Now, captain, you're no
stranger to a distinguished command,

01:07:24.978 --> 01:07:27.646
but how does it feel to be
selected for what must be...

01:07:27.714 --> 01:07:30.081
The most coveted captaincy
in the history of seamanship?

01:07:30.149 --> 01:07:33.351
Quite an honor, i think
i'd say. An honor, yes.

01:07:38.341 --> 01:07:42.444
She's a marvelous ship, sir.
So, how would you sum up?

01:07:42.512 --> 01:07:46.481
After 35 years of service
to queen and sea,

01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:50.152
i've never looked forward
so eagerly to a new command.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.022
How's that? Thank you
very much, captain klaus.

01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:55.490
And captain klaus is not
alone in his feelings,

01:07:55.558 --> 01:07:57.893
because tonight many people
are thinking about...

01:07:57.961 --> 01:08:00.129
The maiden voyage
of <i>the magic christian.</i>

01:08:00.196 --> 01:08:02.131
And, as well,
about the lucky people...

01:08:02.198 --> 01:08:04.800
Who are going to be fortunate
enough to be passengers.

01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:07.369
Although, of course,
the so-called gracious few...

01:08:07.437 --> 01:08:09.438
Will have to dig into their
own pockets to the extent...

01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:11.840
Of about £5,000 each.

01:08:11.908 --> 01:08:14.443
But certainly amongst
these beautiful, trendy people,

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:16.578
it would seem the only "in"
place to be this easter...

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:18.580
Is on board
<i>the magic christian.</i>

01:08:30.676 --> 01:08:34.513
Good evening. This is alan whicker
at tower bridge quay in london,

01:08:34.581 --> 01:08:36.948
from where
the magic christian,

01:08:37.015 --> 01:08:39.117
the most luxurious ship
ever to sail from this port,

01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:45.173
is about to embark upon her maiden
voyage to the new world, to new york.

01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:47.975
And we're here to see
the arrival and the departure...

01:08:48.044 --> 01:08:51.846
Of the elite
of international society--

01:08:51.913 --> 01:08:55.384
the men and women who shape
the destinies of nations--

01:08:55.452 --> 01:08:58.687
the passengers
of the magic christian.

01:08:58.854 --> 01:09:01.673
¶

01:09:07.714 --> 01:09:10.281
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're invited...

01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:13.885
To make your way to the marine
room on the ocean floor deck...

01:09:13.953 --> 01:09:16.955
Where dinner
is now being served...

01:09:17.022 --> 01:09:19.791
And the captain is waiting
to welcome you on board.

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:22.894
¶

01:09:41.197 --> 01:09:45.867
- Youngman, enjoying yourself?
- So far, so good, dad.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:48.203
Good.

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:53.509
Here's our captain on the bridge.
Ah.

01:09:55.878 --> 01:09:58.614
Captain klaus, here.

01:09:58.681 --> 01:10:01.550
Nice to have you aboard.
I'll tell you our course.

01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:05.387
Now leaving thames estuary
and having cleared land's end,

01:10:05.455 --> 01:10:08.223
we shall fix
on about, uh,

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:11.026
forty-seven degrees
west by norwest.

01:10:11.093 --> 01:10:13.762
We're running through
a bit of a chop at the moment,

01:10:13.829 --> 01:10:16.565
but thanks to our
multihead gyrostabilizers,

01:10:16.633 --> 01:10:21.870
i think we can look forward to smooth
sailing throughout the voyage.

01:10:21.937 --> 01:10:25.374
Now here we have our radar,

01:10:25.441 --> 01:10:28.410
and here our photoplot.

01:10:28.478 --> 01:10:32.247
This is the master compass.
And...

01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:36.751
This, of course,
is the wheel.

01:10:36.819 --> 01:10:40.222
Comforting.
Comforting.

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:43.225
But i prefer to handle
the ship myself.

01:10:43.293 --> 01:10:45.227
It may be
an old-fashioned notion,

01:10:45.295 --> 01:10:49.964
but i still like to regard
my ship as a woman.

01:10:52.202 --> 01:10:55.904
Bloody fool!
Shh, shh.

01:10:55.971 --> 01:10:59.908
Nice to have you aboard.

01:10:59.975 --> 01:11:02.010
¶

01:11:07.016 --> 01:11:09.451
Good evening.
Guy grand.

01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:12.421
Chupcho. Major chupcho.
En garde.

01:11:12.488 --> 01:11:14.423
Oh, how do you do.

01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:17.892
I must say, i see
few, if indeed any,

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.231
persons of color
among the ship's cavalry.

01:11:22.298 --> 01:11:25.467
Huh, some blacks? Blacks
aboard the christian?

01:11:25.535 --> 01:11:28.169
Not bloody likely.

01:11:28.238 --> 01:11:33.108
What is it, dear? The fellow's going
on about jungle bunnies, my dear.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:46.121
¶ black and white

01:11:46.188 --> 01:11:49.424
¶ black and white

01:11:49.492 --> 01:11:53.962
¶ everyone everywhere's

01:11:54.029 --> 01:11:57.733
¶ getting uptight

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.070
¶ but gray skies
turn to blue ¶

01:12:02.138 --> 01:12:05.206
¶ when i dance with you

01:12:05.275 --> 01:12:08.943
¶ mr. Universe

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.283
¶ mr. Universe

01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:18.287
- <i>¶ wrong and right</i>
<i>- psst, psst.</i>

01:12:18.354 --> 01:12:21.356
¶ wrong and right

01:12:23.259 --> 01:12:26.561
¶ let us just hold up

01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:29.698
¶ the future is bright

01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:34.469
- <i>¶ but a far far
better moon ¶ - ¶</i>

01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:37.205
¶ You bring into view

01:12:38.274 --> 01:12:42.010
¶ mr. Universe

01:12:42.077 --> 01:12:44.713
¶ mr. Universe

01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:47.382
¶ dancing with

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:53.087
¶ you

01:12:53.155 --> 01:12:57.726
"'oh, badger!' Cried the rat.
'Let us in, please.

01:12:57.794 --> 01:13:00.562
"'It's me, ratty,
and my friend, mole,

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:04.265
- and we've lost our way in the snow.'"
- Oh.

01:13:06.836 --> 01:13:09.421
There's a picture of them
losing their way in the snow.

01:13:09.488 --> 01:13:12.057
It looks very deep.

01:13:12.124 --> 01:13:15.427
"'What, ratty, my dear little
man?' Exclaimed the badger...

01:13:15.494 --> 01:13:17.429
In quite
a different voice."

01:13:27.273 --> 01:13:29.774
Take us to cuba!

01:13:29.842 --> 01:13:31.893
Good heaven.

01:13:33.179 --> 01:13:35.780
<i>Cynthia.</i>
<i>Cynthia! Oh!</i>

01:13:35.848 --> 01:13:37.782
Oh, she's
always asleep.

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:40.952
"Carried a flat candlestick
in his paw."

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.122
Get up! Come on! Get up, everybody!
Get up!

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:46.657
Sounds like trouble
in the passageway.

01:13:46.725 --> 01:13:49.260
They may have
automatic weapons!

01:13:49.328 --> 01:13:51.562
I'll just take
a shuftie.

01:14:04.727 --> 01:14:07.061
Good heavens.
What's all this about, eh?

01:14:07.129 --> 01:14:09.798
Well, there's a general
impression, captain,

01:14:09.866 --> 01:14:12.501
<i>that there's been trouble</i>
<i>on the bridge, eh, lads?</i>

01:14:12.568 --> 01:14:15.236
- Looks like trouble on the bridge.
- Trouble on my bridge?

01:14:15.304 --> 01:14:18.573
That'll be the proverbial
snowstorm in august...

01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:20.675
When there's trouble on
the bridge of <i>the christian.</i>

01:14:20.743 --> 01:14:24.112
Ah. That must be three bells. I, for
one, must get back to the wheel.

01:14:24.179 --> 01:14:27.449
Now, i suggest you all have a talk with
the sitz grog and get back to bed.

01:14:27.517 --> 01:14:30.952
See you in the morning.
Nice to have you aboard.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.556
¶

01:14:40.196 --> 01:14:43.398
Sir!
Sir. Sir.

01:14:43.465 --> 01:14:47.769
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the
ship's physician, laurence faggot.

01:14:47.837 --> 01:14:50.906
Oh, doctor, what in the name
of god's going on here?

01:14:50.973 --> 01:14:54.276
Now, now, sir herb.
What's all this?

01:14:54.343 --> 01:14:57.279
Fair-weather sailor,
cross and irritable,

01:14:57.346 --> 01:15:00.748
the moment things don't
exactly suit you. Suit me!

01:15:00.817 --> 01:15:03.718
There are odd things going
on that need an explanation!

01:15:03.786 --> 01:15:06.721
Explanation? Why don't we
have a little tête-à-tête.

01:15:06.789 --> 01:15:09.791
Perhaps, you could tell me about your
childhood, your early childhood.

01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:13.161
I don't need any of that
psychological claptrap!

01:15:13.229 --> 01:15:16.397
If you could please just
give me some tranquilizers.

01:15:16.465 --> 01:15:20.668
Escape into drugs? Mask your
fears in an artificial fog?

01:15:20.736 --> 01:15:23.538
Oh, surely, you can't be serious.
Oh, well,

01:15:23.605 --> 01:15:25.807
give me some decent
english aspirin.

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:28.310
Here, sir herb, try this. It's
just what the doctor ordered.

01:15:28.377 --> 01:15:31.579
Oh, what is it.
It's cannabis, a herb.

01:15:33.615 --> 01:15:37.919
It'll tighten your wig.
Tighten my wig?

01:15:37.987 --> 01:15:41.756
Why, it's damnable wog hemp!

01:15:41.824 --> 01:15:46.394
<i>Who do you think you're kidding? I
saw you try to ditch that stuff.</i>

01:15:46.462 --> 01:15:50.431
Okay, buddy. This is a bust.
Let's move.

01:15:50.499 --> 01:15:54.385
B-but i was in bed reading!
Oh, cynthia!

01:15:54.453 --> 01:15:57.688
This damnable wog hemp is burning
a hole in the ship's carpet, son.

01:15:57.756 --> 01:16:00.291
We don't want that, do we, dad?
No, we don't.

01:16:00.359 --> 01:16:03.361
Let's really go and listen to the story.
Good idea.

01:16:03.429 --> 01:16:06.797
¶

01:16:06.865 --> 01:16:10.768
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
This is, of course, the pool room.

01:16:10.836 --> 01:16:14.071
Quite a nasty squall on today,

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:17.008
freezing fog at about
two-feet visibility.

01:16:17.075 --> 01:16:19.410
But you wouldn't think so here on
the promenade deck, would you?

01:16:19.478 --> 01:16:23.047
Just feel that sunshine and its
life-giving rays. Hmm, lovely.

01:16:23.115 --> 01:16:25.049
Good morning!
Morning.

01:16:25.117 --> 01:16:27.519
Morning.

01:16:27.586 --> 01:16:31.656
<i>Now then, let's step into the
sea spray bar for an aperitif.</i>

01:16:33.559 --> 01:16:38.263
Testing, hot damn vietnam.
Testing, hot damn vietnam.

01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:41.466
One, two, buckle my shoe.
Hear this. Attention, please.

01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:44.769
We're happy to announce today's
feature film presentation...

01:16:44.836 --> 01:16:48.373
Will be men in white, the gripping
story of love and sacrifice,

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:51.576
commencing in five minutes in the
"b" deck theater. <i>Men in white?</i>

01:16:51.644 --> 01:16:56.181
Men in white? One of the great classics
of the silver screen, am i right, son?

01:16:56.248 --> 01:16:59.150
Right again, dad. You're quite uncanny.
Come on. Let's go.

01:17:08.861 --> 01:17:12.180
Well, there it is, nurse.

01:17:12.248 --> 01:17:16.500
Why, you're lookin' at the all-american
answer to the color problem,

01:17:16.568 --> 01:17:21.222
the first multiracial
head transplant in history.

01:17:23.258 --> 01:17:25.426
<i>Aw, shoot!</i>

01:17:25.494 --> 01:17:30.431
Oh, never mind. There's plenty
more where that boy come from.

01:17:30.499 --> 01:17:33.234
Yes?

01:17:35.871 --> 01:17:38.640
Your tea, milady. Just put
it down on the table.

01:17:38.708 --> 01:17:40.742
Yes, milady.

01:17:46.381 --> 01:17:49.017
Thank you.
That will be all.

01:17:50.052 --> 01:17:53.287
Not... quite,
milady.

01:17:59.028 --> 01:18:00.829
No more bets now.

01:18:02.231 --> 01:18:05.500
No more bets. Thank you.

01:18:05.567 --> 01:18:07.636
Twenty-four, black.

01:18:08.738 --> 01:18:12.206
Sir, he pocketed my plaque.
He what?

01:18:12.274 --> 01:18:14.943
That swine, rivello, he removed my wager.
I didn't see that.

01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:18.013
He put it in his pocket. He
pocketed my plaque! All right, sir.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.382
I highly recommend
this beaujolais.

01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:23.451
Oh, i mustn't have
too much, must i?

01:18:23.519 --> 01:18:25.654
Well, perhaps,
just a little bit more.

01:18:25.721 --> 01:18:28.106
¶

01:18:34.446 --> 01:18:37.415
Would you like to buy a
girl a drink, big boy?

01:18:45.190 --> 01:18:47.525
Thanks.

01:18:51.563 --> 01:18:54.666
Here's looking
at you, mister.

01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:58.870
¶

01:19:06.145 --> 01:19:10.815
Oh, isn't this fun, guy?
Divine. Divine.

01:19:22.044 --> 01:19:23.945
Oh, look, guy!

01:19:24.013 --> 01:19:27.916
How gravely they dance.

01:19:27.983 --> 01:19:30.418
¶

01:19:30.485 --> 01:19:34.622
¶ Mad about the boy

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:36.758
¶ i know it's stupid

01:19:36.825 --> 01:19:40.828
¶ to be mad
about the boy ¶

01:19:40.896 --> 01:19:43.031
¶ i'm so

01:19:43.098 --> 01:19:45.767
¶ ashamed of it
but must admit ¶

01:19:45.834 --> 01:19:49.403
¶ the sleepless nights

01:19:49.471 --> 01:19:52.807
¶ i'm mad about the boy

01:19:55.844 --> 01:19:59.113
¶
¶ on the silver screen

01:19:59.181 --> 01:20:01.583
¶ he melts my foolish heart

01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:04.318
¶ in every single scene

01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:10.157
¶ although, i'm quite aware
that here and there ¶

01:20:10.225 --> 01:20:13.595
¶ are traces of

¶ the cad about the boy

01:20:18.533 --> 01:20:23.671
¶ lord knows
i'm not a fool girl ¶

01:20:23.739 --> 01:20:27.075
¶ i really shouldn't care

01:20:28.543 --> 01:20:32.179
¶ lord knows
i'm not a schoolgirl ¶

01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:37.835
¶ in the flurry of her first

01:20:37.903 --> 01:20:40.305
¶ affair

01:20:42.141 --> 01:20:44.342
¶ if i could employ

01:20:44.410 --> 01:20:47.812
¶ a little magic

01:20:47.879 --> 01:20:51.382
¶ that would
finally destroy ¶

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:55.987
¶ this dream that pains me
and enchains me ¶

01:20:56.055 --> 01:20:59.490
¶ but i can't because

01:20:59.558 --> 01:21:03.161

Oh, yes.

01:21:19.678 --> 01:21:23.314
Now hear this.
Now hear this.

01:21:33.658 --> 01:21:37.362
<i>Please</i>
<i>put on your life jackets.</i>

01:21:37.429 --> 01:21:40.965
Quietly, go to your cabins
and wait there.

01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:46.704
Maybe the ship's going
down with all hands down.

01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:50.708
Passengers are respectfully
reminded...

01:21:50.775 --> 01:21:53.444
That cabin carts are not--

01:21:53.512 --> 01:21:57.315
repeat-- not allowed
to accept gratuities.

01:21:57.383 --> 01:21:59.350
Thank you.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:06.891
There is no cause for alarm.
There is no cause for--

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:08.959
you know, it's probably
a lifeboat drill.

01:22:10.662 --> 01:22:13.614
Better safe than sorry, one.

01:22:13.682 --> 01:22:15.850
Make your way to "b" deck
immediately. I repeat--

01:22:15.918 --> 01:22:19.087
make your way to "c" deck
immediately.

01:22:23.642 --> 01:22:27.245
Youngman, what is going on? Ship's
concert, i shouldn't wonder.

01:22:27.312 --> 01:22:30.314
The magic christian
has proven to be...

01:22:30.382 --> 01:22:32.850
Unseaworthy.

01:22:33.052 --> 01:22:37.855
I repeat-- the magic christian
has proven to---

01:22:40.258 --> 01:22:42.192
Looks like trouble
on the bridge.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:45.129
What's going on?
What is going on?

01:22:45.196 --> 01:22:47.598
What's happening?
What's happening?

01:22:48.684 --> 01:22:51.169
No, but seriously, folks.

01:22:52.754 --> 01:22:55.156
Sir, i say, how do we
get out of here?

01:22:55.224 --> 01:22:58.860
Through the engine room, if memory serves.
Thank you so much.

01:22:58.928 --> 01:23:02.146
In, out.

01:23:02.481 --> 01:23:04.899
In, out!

01:23:04.966 --> 01:23:09.571
In, out. In--

01:23:09.638 --> 01:23:13.474
during my reign
as priestess of the whip,

01:23:13.542 --> 01:23:16.644
i've never seen such
unmitigated sloth.

01:23:16.712 --> 01:23:21.182
- My god! What's going on here?
- <i>J'accuse!</i>

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:24.819
How dare this intrusion?
Who are these people?

01:23:24.886 --> 01:23:28.089
- Oh, these are me mates.
- Out! Out!

01:23:28.156 --> 01:23:30.658
Oh, i say!

01:23:30.726 --> 01:23:33.361
Do that again.
Out!

01:23:33.429 --> 01:23:36.431
Out!
Out of my galley!

01:23:46.842 --> 01:23:49.543
Everything's shipshape.

01:24:10.616 --> 01:24:12.783
Abandon ship!

01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:16.954
What channel's that thing?
I really can't imagine.

01:24:17.022 --> 01:24:19.657
All this violence.
Oh, really, guy.

01:24:19.724 --> 01:24:21.659
Eh? Huh?

01:24:21.726 --> 01:24:25.229
One of the classics
of yesteryear, is it?

01:24:25.297 --> 01:24:28.999
You can say what you like, agnes, but
when it comes to family entertainment,

01:24:29.067 --> 01:24:32.036
the old hollywood moguls can
still show us a thing or two.

01:24:32.103 --> 01:24:37.041
This is the new captain
speaking. Now hear this.

01:24:37.108 --> 01:24:41.478
Here, get a dolly! Thank god, we've arrived!
It's new york!

01:24:54.893 --> 01:24:57.412
Well, look!
Look, it's tower bridge!

01:24:57.479 --> 01:24:59.414
It's bloody tower bridge!

01:24:59.481 --> 01:25:02.016
Christ!
We haven't gone anywhere!

01:25:02.451 --> 01:25:06.837
We spent the last 48 hours
in the goddamn warehouse!

01:25:22.338 --> 01:25:26.824
Now getting it ready for you.

01:25:26.891 --> 01:25:31.529
Now getting it ready for you!

01:25:31.597 --> 01:25:36.200
Not yet ready for you!
Won't be long though!

01:25:37.769 --> 01:25:40.371
Now getting it ready.

01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:44.007
Come back later.
<i>Nearly ready.</i>

01:25:44.075 --> 01:25:46.810
Almost ready for you.

<i>Free money.</i>
<i>Don't rush the stairway.</i>

01:25:57.206 --> 01:26:01.509
Here, very soon.
<i>And it's free!</i>

01:26:01.577 --> 01:26:04.412
<i>Remember that!</i>
<i>Free money!</i>

01:26:04.479 --> 01:26:07.014
<i>Costs you nothing!</i>

01:26:08.517 --> 01:26:12.286
Arriving now!
Arriving now!

01:26:14.456 --> 01:26:17.891
<i>Sir guy grant?</i>
<i>Grand. Yes. Yes.</i>

01:26:17.959 --> 01:26:20.761
This your order then?
Let's have a look.

01:26:20.829 --> 01:26:24.932
Is this right, son?
Uh, 100 gallons of blood.

01:26:24.999 --> 01:26:27.301
Two hundred gallons
of urine.

01:26:27.369 --> 01:26:29.770
Five hundred cubic feet
of animal manure. Yeah.

01:26:29.838 --> 01:26:31.839
Where do you
want it put?

01:26:31.906 --> 01:26:34.442
Put it in the vat.
Put it in that, fred.
