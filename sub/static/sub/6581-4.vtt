WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:01.502
( panting )

00:28.496 --> 00:30.064
Stop! Help!

00:30.098 --> 00:31.799
Stop! Stop!
Please, stop!

00:34.102 --> 00:35.803
( Tilda panting )

00:48.116 --> 00:49.083
All clear, Mother.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.688
Well done, Tilda.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.690
Help your sisters
unload the back.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.247
Why do we have one
of Quinn's Clippers?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.215
My baron will have
your head for this.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.818
My head?

01:35.629 --> 01:37.131
( squelches )

01:37.165 --> 01:38.299
I doubt it.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.403
( shouting,
blows landing )

02:23.344 --> 02:24.478
What's wrong?

02:24.512 --> 02:25.746
I didn't teach you that move.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.880
Where'd you learn that?

02:26.914 --> 02:28.882
It just came out of me.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.318
Pretty good, huh?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.452
You're not ready
for that yet.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.886
Just admit it.
You're impressed.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.755
Yes, your forms
are improving,

02:34.788 --> 02:36.524
but your attacks
are still predictable.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.192
Yeah? Predict this!

02:40.794 --> 02:42.830
You need to learn to make
the unexpected move.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.799
( footsteps approach )

02:50.438 --> 02:54.908
Sunny,
I was looking for you
at the barracks.

02:54.942 --> 02:57.778
My Colt seems
to concentrate
better up here.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.581
Go practice your forms.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.395
Did you ever
glean what the Widow
wanted with him?

03:14.428 --> 03:16.730
- No, Baron.
- Mm-hmm.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.234
We've lost some
good men of late.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
I want to be sure

03:21.902 --> 03:24.738
our numbers are still superior
to those of our neighbors.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.507
They are,
and we're ready.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.609
Any word from Jacobee
about the parley?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.010
He's probably angry with me.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.012
Like the other barons,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.615
they don't like that we took
the Widow's oil fields.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.485
They fail to remember that
the Widow attacked me first.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.886
I warned them.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.622
Her only allegiance
is to herself.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.524
The other barons
will understand that.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.692
They should.

03:44.725 --> 03:49.029
And if not,
a storm will break

03:49.062 --> 03:52.433
and all this will be lost
in the flood of war.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.772
I need you, Sunny.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.641
Now more than ever.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.526
( chattering )

04:25.866 --> 04:29.403
Tilda, look at this.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.310
( music playing )

04:36.344 --> 04:38.346
* Mm, yeah

04:39.580 --> 04:41.415
* Oh whoa-oh

04:41.449 --> 04:45.653
* I used to feel
that two hearts could be *

04:45.686 --> 04:49.923
* Wrapped in a love
that is, oh, so real *

04:49.957 --> 04:54.428
* Well, now the only thing
that I can feel is *

04:54.462 --> 04:58.732
* It's plain to see
love's just not for me *

04:58.766 --> 05:03.737
* It's plain to see love's
just not for me *

05:03.771 --> 05:08.041
* When I met you, it was
to have and to hold-- *

05:14.648 --> 05:17.385
I asked for this place
to be cleaned an hour ago.

05:17.418 --> 05:21.021
New recruits are coming
and we need to be ready.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.723
No one is coming.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.596
- What did you say?
- I said that no one
is coming.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.570
Esta, take over here.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.448
Tilda, is there something
you want to get off your chest?

05:49.082 --> 05:51.385
We kill for you.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.654
We die for you.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.923
For what?

05:55.956 --> 05:58.926
Why did we frame Quinn
for the robbery
of the transport?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.861
Are we trying
to start a war?

06:00.894 --> 06:04.765
Do you really have
such little faith in me?

06:04.798 --> 06:08.569
I recall a girl
who used to cook me
breakfast every morning.

06:10.037 --> 06:14.007
She always greeted me
with a smile.

06:14.041 --> 06:17.578
Do you remember what happened
to that girl, Tilda?

06:17.611 --> 06:20.448
What my husband did to her?

06:20.481 --> 06:21.915
What did I tell that girl?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.954
That you would protect me
and teach me to be strong.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.656
And you are strong--

06:28.689 --> 06:31.391
stronger than any man
who would ever try
and hurt you.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.496
We are fighting for a world

06:35.529 --> 06:37.898
where girls don't
get dragged into dark rooms

06:37.931 --> 06:40.701
and have their innocence
torn from them.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.138
But that world
comes at a price.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.577
So remember that
the next time

06:49.610 --> 06:51.979
you disrespect me
in front of your sisters.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.087
( M.K. grunting )

07:05.192 --> 07:08.095
( grunting continues,
blows landing )

08:13.794 --> 08:15.729
I've never seen
one of these before.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.098
- What is it?
- That's a blood orange.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.700
It's very rare.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.769
It only grows
in a single orchard

08:21.802 --> 08:24.104
in the southern territory.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.907
Its juice is prized
for its healing properties.

08:26.940 --> 08:31.311
A gift from Baron Rojas,
Baroness.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.881
I'm not baroness yet, Mari.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.883
And even then,
I'll always be Jade to you.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.655
Have you given
any thought

08:41.689 --> 08:43.256
about how you plan
to incorporate these gifts

08:43.290 --> 08:45.659
into the wedding ceremony?

08:45.693 --> 08:47.828
Yes. I've decided not to.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.130
The other barons
aren't even coming,

08:50.163 --> 08:51.264
so there's no need
for their gifts

08:51.298 --> 08:52.900
to occupy
a place of honor.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.202
I only mention it
because it's tradition.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.670
This particular
tradition, though,

08:56.704 --> 08:58.739
is one I think
we should change.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.674
After all,
why would we cater
to a group of rivals

09:00.708 --> 09:01.742
who wished us dead?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.946
Mari, could you
excuse us, please?

09:16.323 --> 09:19.760
Jade, let's speak
plainly for once.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.729
I know what
you're going to say.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.631
What's happened--
me and the baron,

09:23.664 --> 09:25.298
it can't be easy for you.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.170
And I never
wanted to be the person
who brings you pain.

09:30.203 --> 09:34.241
Oh, you don't.
Quinn does that job
very well.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.117
I never had a mother.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.053
And you never
had a daughter.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.689
Maybe if we saw
each other as that
rather than as rivals,

09:48.722 --> 09:50.758
it would help us
survive this.

09:53.093 --> 09:57.665
Well, if I were
your mother,

09:57.698 --> 10:00.801
I would warn you not to sleep
with your future husband

10:00.834 --> 10:03.003
and his son
at the same time.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.885
You want to poison me
to cure me?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.655
There is no cure.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.156
Not really.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.095
My father knew
a great deal more

10:28.128 --> 10:30.731
about growths
and tumors than I do.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.167
I have
some of his books,

10:34.201 --> 10:37.237
but unfortunately
he wasn't able

10:37.270 --> 10:39.807
to teach me everything
before he...

10:39.840 --> 10:42.242
When I find
the nomads responsible,

10:42.275 --> 10:46.046
you can be sure justice
will be swift and true.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.050
That's all I want.

10:53.420 --> 10:57.390
The decoction
he listed in his notes
will weaken you,

10:57.424 --> 10:59.993
but it may heal
the growth first
if you're strong enough.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.965
Your father told me
that I wouldn't live

11:04.998 --> 11:08.702
to see the winter solstice.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.304
Well, this
would be the only way
to prove him wrong.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.806
I saw you practicing
your forms last night.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.407
You been doing that
every night?

11:47.440 --> 11:48.909
I told you I was serious.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.078
I'm impressed.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.915
So what are
we doing out here?

11:56.283 --> 11:57.818
I don't want
any witnesses.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.927
You're going to cut me,
aren't you?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.395
We need to know
what we're dealing with.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.998
Sunny, I'm not ready.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.400
The only way I can help you
is to face you.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.243
Now focus.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.012
Fight through it.

12:52.172 --> 12:52.405
( groans )

13:26.306 --> 13:28.008
I could've killed you.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.277
But you didn't.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.812
Maybe next time,
you should just
kill me first.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.891
After you get cut,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.093
do you really
not remember anything?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.262
It's not even me.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.931
It is,

13:50.964 --> 13:53.066
it's just a part of you
you don't want to face.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.869
How can I control it?

13:55.903 --> 13:57.037
You don't.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.173
Every force has its equal.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.877
Fear, peace, dark, light--

14:03.911 --> 14:05.445
one can't exist
without the other.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.117
Next time
it happens to you,

14:10.150 --> 14:12.652
I want you
to try to focus.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.388
Focus on a point
inside of you.

14:15.422 --> 14:19.292
It can be a sound,
an image, a memory.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.096
Something safe,
something pure.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.371
Name something pure.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.485
Quinn:
You're certain
he was one of ours?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.254
Ryder:
Yeah, he was patrolling
the western border,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.522
but never checked in.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.492
Today's patrol found this
hanging from the gate
at Porter's Pass.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.429
Jacobee.

14:56.463 --> 15:00.433
He claims we attacked
one of his gold transports.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.335
Well, it's a trap.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.004
He's trying
to pick a fight.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.006
Yeah, not him.
The Widow.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.342
She's been too quiet
since we ran her out
of the lodge.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.978
This is her move--

15:11.011 --> 15:14.982
pit me against
my closest ally.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.517
I want you to ride out
and agree to the parley,

15:17.550 --> 15:20.487
but don't let them set it
too far from our territory.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.656
You want me to ride out?

15:23.690 --> 15:27.194
A pigeon
can send a message.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.530
This is a job
for a Clipper at best,
not the son of a baron.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.332
You beg me
for more responsibility,

15:32.365 --> 15:33.500
but when I give it,
you balk.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.335
You never give anything.

15:35.368 --> 15:39.672
Every gift has a price.
Every favor is a test.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.741
You take what you want,
leave me your scraps,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.211
and expect me
to worship you
with gratitude.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.281
Is this about Jade?

15:50.717 --> 15:54.321
I know you were
fond of each other
when you were children.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.090
And you may have even
thought you were in love.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.559
It must be difficult now
to think of her

15:59.592 --> 16:02.729
as a-- a new mother.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.400
I don't think
of her that way.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.269
She's nothing
like my mother.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.404
Yeah...

16:11.438 --> 16:14.174
especially
the way she tastes.

16:18.445 --> 16:22.282
A man cannot wait
to be given what he wants.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.217
He must take it.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.553
Hmm?
Now, when I was
in your shoes,

16:26.586 --> 16:30.290
I would've volunteered
to ride out and meet
a challenge.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.225
I would've demanded it.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.628
You take Petri
and Donovan with you.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.365
No.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.103
No, I carry your name.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.042
That's all
the protection I need.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.286
- ( door opens )
- ( bell jingles )

16:59.319 --> 17:00.587
( door closes )

17:02.289 --> 17:03.690
What are you doing?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.126
It's okay.
Nobody knows
we're back yet.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.229
Where's Sunny?

17:09.262 --> 17:11.331
He's taking his bike
to the lockup.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.434
- I was wondering about--
- Your book?

17:15.568 --> 17:17.070
Here.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.639
Can you read it yet?

17:19.672 --> 17:22.609
Nothing about this book
makes sense.

17:27.847 --> 17:30.317
- ( door opens )
- ( bell jingles )

17:30.350 --> 17:31.718
Veil:
Sunny.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.424
You stole that from my room.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.693
I think it can
show us the way
out of the Badlands.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.695
You told me
you knew the way.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.631
You said you would show me
if I helped you.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.466
I can.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.734
I trusted you.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.570
Hey. Sunny,
let him go.

17:56.143 --> 17:59.179
( door opens, closes )

17:59.212 --> 18:01.281
How long have
you been helping him?

18:01.314 --> 18:03.550
A couple weeks.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.817
He brought it to me.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.819
I didn't know
it was yours

18:06.853 --> 18:08.621
or that it was
our way out.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.360
What's going on, Sunny?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.664
Quinn is losing his mind.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.371
He's leading
the Badlands into war.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.575
That'd be the tumor
in his head.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.444
How do you know that?

18:32.745 --> 18:35.114
Because I'm treating him now.

18:36.583 --> 18:40.887
I mean, I really
can't do anything

18:40.920 --> 18:43.256
except maybe
end his life sooner.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.793
That's not the way.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.365
His death would
bring the other barons
right to our door.

19:12.252 --> 19:12.752
( whooshing, thuds )

19:19.726 --> 19:21.694
Ryder.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.431
I don't know
whether to feel
honored or insulted.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.968
We didn't attack
your gold transport.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.970
Daddy must not
think much of you,

19:31.003 --> 19:32.772
sending you out here
all alone.

19:32.805 --> 19:36.309
That was my choice.
Now you make yours.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.311
When and where
do we set the parley?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.247
Tomorrow at noon.
Raven Flats.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.414
That's too far.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.317
City of the Dead,
Cross Bend.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.562
Wait.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.369
You haven't heard
the full proposal.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.804
Didn't you
just deliver it?

20:07.507 --> 20:09.809
I meant my proposal.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.717
Waldo:
Sunshine,
what's on your mind?

20:17.750 --> 20:21.621
A long time ago,
you told me if a man
wanted to get out,

20:21.654 --> 20:24.357
- he needed three things--
- Not this again.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.658
Passage up the river,

20:25.692 --> 20:28.295
a map through
the wasteland,

20:28.328 --> 20:29.962
and nothing left to lose.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.232
Sunny, listen to me.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.672
There is no
through the wasteland.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.509
There's just death
and drought

20:42.542 --> 20:43.943
and more death,

20:43.976 --> 20:46.879
and you sure as shit
don't need a map to find it.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.285
I'm leaving, Waldo,
with Veil.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.920
She's pregnant.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.722
So what?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.391
I imagine I've got
a dozen pups

20:58.425 --> 21:01.461
pissing on posts
around here.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.695
Every Clipper does.

21:08.368 --> 21:12.405
You went
and you fell in love,
didn't you?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.853
You ever seen
the River King
in the flesh?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.022
No.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.658
The baron's always
dealt with him directly.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.626
That's because
they need his blessing.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.728
Anything moves up or down
the river without it,

21:35.762 --> 21:38.030
nothing gets where
it's supposed to go.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.711
- What is that?
- It'll get you an audience

21:51.744 --> 21:53.546
with the River King.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.515
I can't say
what his price will be,

21:55.548 --> 21:58.385
but he is the only one
gonna get you through
the Badlands.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.355
I can't take that.
That's your way out.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.990
Sunshine, if I was
ever gonna leave,

22:04.023 --> 22:05.992
I'd have done it
long before now.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.362
Besides,
I never found anything

22:09.396 --> 22:12.832
or anyone
worth leaving for.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.986
( footsteps approach )

22:39.426 --> 22:40.627
What are you doing here?

22:42.429 --> 22:45.398
Did you even know
I was gone?

22:45.432 --> 22:46.966
I am on my way
to your father's room.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.935
- If he knew
you were here--
- Stop.

22:54.173 --> 22:57.410
You haven't come
to my room in weeks.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.446
Getting ready
for the wedding--

22:59.479 --> 23:01.514
No, I told you
not to talk about that.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.116
Ryder, it's happening.

23:06.786 --> 23:07.854
There's nothing
you can do to stop it.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.456
And what if I was baron?

23:09.489 --> 23:10.857
We both know
you won't challenge
your father.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.092
A man has to take
what he wants.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.631
It's over.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.474
So you're cutting me
loose, too?

23:27.507 --> 23:29.108
- Just like my mother.
- That's not fair.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.610
I'm doing this
for your own good.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.178
No, that's exactly
what she said.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.146
- Don't compare me to her!
- No, you're right.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.982
You're not even
in her league.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.217
I can handle Lydia.
Trust me.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.453
You know who else
said that?

23:40.487 --> 23:42.021
Quinn's second wife.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.756
Beatrice?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.993
Do you really believe
she died of natural causes?

23:52.965 --> 23:54.867
Don't be naive.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.146
( chatter )

24:07.179 --> 24:10.583
( horse neighs, nickers )

24:28.935 --> 24:30.603
Jade.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.471
Jade:
I need your help.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.142
Are you in
some kind of trouble?

24:36.175 --> 24:38.578
No. No.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.082
I know that before me

24:43.115 --> 24:44.851
you served as
handmaiden to Beatrice.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.689
Is there anything
you can tell me?

25:02.334 --> 25:06.172
A week before Beatrice passed,
I saw the baroness.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.840
She was out beyond
the poppy fields

25:07.874 --> 25:09.609
where the monkshood
grows wild.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.144
Monkshood?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.647
My papa used to crush
the flowers,

25:14.681 --> 25:17.917
mix it with cane juice,
and leave it out
for the rats.

25:17.950 --> 25:22.121
The flowers,
they kill you
from the inside out.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.956
( gasps )

25:25.958 --> 25:27.660
Man:
Don't let him
take it back.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.261
- ( grunts )
- Nice! Yeah!

25:29.295 --> 25:32.799
Man #2:
Good, good. No!

25:32.832 --> 25:34.834
( chatter continues )

25:34.867 --> 25:37.670
M.K., show Oren
that armlock.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.906
The one you
kicked my ass with.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.276
M.K., what's up
with you?

25:44.310 --> 25:47.013
Regent.
Present!

25:47.046 --> 25:49.682
- Man: Let's go, let's go!
- Man #2: Fall in line!

25:54.654 --> 25:56.222
Salute!

25:56.255 --> 25:58.290
Orders just came down.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.960
We're heading out
before dawn for a parley.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.829
Fully armed escort,
including the baron.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.731
I need six scouts.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.100
You, you, you,

26:08.134 --> 26:11.270
you, you, and you.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.905
Back to your drills.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.707
Scouts, on me.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.175
Hey!

26:16.208 --> 26:18.044
What about me?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.812
I'm your Colt.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.718
( clock ticking )

26:25.752 --> 26:27.754
( birds chirping )

26:42.902 --> 26:44.671
Sunny:
Baron?

26:44.704 --> 26:46.338
It's time.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.690
Graveyard's closed!

27:03.723 --> 27:07.259
Unless you wish to join
your loved ones, get out!

27:07.293 --> 27:09.762
Stay by the gate
and keep watch.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.780
Sunny?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.157
I told you to stay.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.060
You also told me
to make the unexpected move.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.131
Trouble with
your Colt, Sunny?

27:46.766 --> 27:48.134
No, Baron.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.109
I'll deal with you later.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.911
Keep watch.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.472
Jacobee.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.347
I had nothing to do
with the attack on
your transports.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.349
I would never do
something so brazen.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.251
Such as lead
an unsanctioned raid

29:12.284 --> 29:13.820
on another baron's
property?

29:13.853 --> 29:16.088
The Widow was trying
to kill my son.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.224
- She made it personal.
- Personal?

29:20.526 --> 29:22.028
Then why take
the oil fields?

29:23.362 --> 29:25.197
For our mutual protection.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.437
I wasn't the one
who was so willing
to recognize her.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.472
I could see the Widow
had no interest

29:33.505 --> 29:35.241
in preserving
our way of life.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.209
- And you do?
- Of course.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.311
It was never
handed to me.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.513
Your father and I
have that in common.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.082
For the record,

29:43.115 --> 29:46.085
my old man,
he never liked you, Quinn.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.887
He deferred to you

29:47.920 --> 29:51.123
because your interests
were aligned.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.826
I'm not so sure
that ours are anymore.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.528
Those oil fields
cost me good men

29:56.562 --> 29:58.965
and I intend
to hold on to them.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.352
Look out!

30:28.327 --> 30:29.495
( all yelling )

30:32.498 --> 30:33.933
Come back!

30:56.055 --> 30:57.256
( grunts )

31:06.498 --> 31:08.467
( grunts )

31:08.500 --> 31:09.568
( screams )

31:20.346 --> 31:22.381
This is your mother's idea
of a better world?

31:22.414 --> 31:23.515
Starting a war?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.467
( gasping )

32:34.253 --> 32:36.355
M.K.!

32:37.489 --> 32:40.292
( faint, echoes )
Please.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.558
( grunts, groans )

33:21.133 --> 33:23.435
This is the end,
Quinn.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.275
Zypher!

33:34.580 --> 33:35.747
It was the Widow.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.650
She started this.

33:51.663 --> 33:54.400
You're the one
who antagonized her,
Quinn.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.568
If you want
the other barons
to back down,

33:56.602 --> 33:59.105
deal with her.

34:27.799 --> 34:28.234
( horses snorting )

34:37.476 --> 34:39.245
Something's wrong.

34:39.278 --> 34:42.281
Where are all the cogs
and the Clippers?

34:42.314 --> 34:44.316
The fields are deserted.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.095
( fly buzzing )

35:35.367 --> 35:36.802
( woman gasps )

35:42.408 --> 35:45.211
( whimpering )

35:45.244 --> 35:47.513
- Baron!
- Mari: No.
No, no, no.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.415
( crying )

35:49.448 --> 35:52.851
All right, no one's
gonna hurt you.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.265
What happened?

36:06.298 --> 36:07.699
Mari:
The Widow.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.235
She came with
a bunch of girls.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.769
They killed
all the Clippers.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.904
They promised
to give the cogs
a better life

36:12.938 --> 36:15.441
and offered them gold.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.345
More gold
than I've ever seen.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.954
Quinn:
For your loyalty.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.857
( thunder rumbling )

36:39.931 --> 36:42.401
Quinn:
I'm holding you
accountable, Sunny.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.735
Find the Widow.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.405
And when you do,
I wanna spill her guts

36:46.438 --> 36:47.706
and hang her
from the wall

36:47.739 --> 36:49.608
for all the Badlands
to see.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.624
Where am I?

37:05.657 --> 37:07.693
Where's Jacobee?

37:07.726 --> 37:09.928
You said he agreed
to hear my proposal.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.563
Widow:
You're not here
to meet Jacobee.

37:12.764 --> 37:13.832
Easy, boy.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.841
You're working with her?

37:22.874 --> 37:26.445
Widow:
I have eyes and ears
everywhere.

37:26.478 --> 37:29.515
I'm not interested
in anything this bitch
has to say.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.483
Come now, Ryder.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.619
You tried to kill me.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.854
I tried to kill you.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.255
Now we're even.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.993
Let's focus
on our mutual enemy.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.695
Your father.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.931
He doesn't
believe in you.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.633
He never has.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.536
I hear your own mother
cast you aside as well.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.903
I know what it's like

37:51.937 --> 37:54.873
to be rejected
and underestimated.

37:54.906 --> 37:58.344
I admired the fact
that you came after me.

37:58.377 --> 38:01.880
- It was decisive.
- I came here to meet
a real baron.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.014
You want the fort.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.518
Zypher wants Jacobee's.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.821
I'll help you get them.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.659
Be smart.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.694
Join our alliance.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.464
I've already stolen
his cogs.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.567
I'm going to take him down
with or without you.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.002
I see what Zypher and I
get out of this.

38:25.837 --> 38:26.938
And what do you want?

38:30.576 --> 38:32.578
There's a boy in the fort.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.312
He wears this pendant.

38:38.784 --> 38:39.851
If I get him...

38:41.453 --> 38:43.955
you'll be a baron.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.924
Isn't that
what you always wanted?

39:10.716 --> 39:13.018
( seagulls screeching )

39:19.425 --> 39:21.993
I'm here to see
the River King.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.648
Waldo must hold you
in high esteem

39:42.681 --> 39:44.983
if he gave you this.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.685
What can I do for you?

39:48.019 --> 39:50.155
I need passage
out of the Badlands.

39:50.188 --> 39:52.558
( chuckles )

39:55.226 --> 39:57.128
And so you think
going to a new place

39:57.162 --> 39:58.830
is going to change
who you are,

39:58.864 --> 40:00.732
save your soul?

40:00.766 --> 40:02.901
I won't be
traveling alone.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.972
So you wanna save
someone else, too?

40:07.005 --> 40:08.607
Now I know
you're a fool.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.842
Can you help me or not?

40:12.043 --> 40:13.612
This favor
was for Waldo.

40:13.645 --> 40:16.147
I owe you nothing.

40:16.181 --> 40:20.752
But out of respect
for what he did for me,

40:20.786 --> 40:23.421
I'm sure we can
come to terms.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.637
A month ago,
a shipment of cogs

40:38.670 --> 40:40.539
was heading
this way to me.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.941
28 in all.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.577
When my men
opened the hatch,

40:45.611 --> 40:49.515
they found a scene
of slaughter.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.651
All but one of the cogs
was dead.

40:52.684 --> 40:56.054
Killed
in a murderous rage.

40:56.087 --> 40:59.558
Before the last soul
passed...

40:59.591 --> 41:02.027
she was able to identify
the perpetrator.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.036
This boy has cost me
money and respect.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.639
I want you to find him,

41:13.672 --> 41:15.874
clip him,

41:15.907 --> 41:18.544
and bring his head
to me as payment.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.211
Do this...

41:20.245 --> 41:22.914
and I'll guarantee you
and your companions

41:22.948 --> 41:25.717
safe passage
out of the Badlands

41:25.751 --> 41:30.488
to a place where no one
will ever find you.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.703
( music playing )
