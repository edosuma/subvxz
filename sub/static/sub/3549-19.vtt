WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:05.106
(Edie) SO I'M DRIVING MY CAR
THE OTHER NIGHT,

00:05.106 --> 00:07.108
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS?

00:07.108 --> 00:08.739
(tires screech, loud crash)

00:08.739 --> 00:12.043
I CRASHED INTO A UTILITY POLE.

00:12.043 --> 00:15.216
THEN, TO ADD INSULT
TO INJURY...

00:15.216 --> 00:18.489
(electricity crackles)
 I WAS ELECTROCUTED.

00:18.489 --> 00:21.192
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:21.192 --> 00:24.325
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.358
ALL MY NEIGHBORS
HEARD IT HAPPEN,

00:27.358 --> 00:30.601
SO THEY QUICKLY LEFT
THEIR MICROWAVED BURRITOS...

00:30.601 --> 00:35.206
AND THEIR EXPENSIVE JARS
OF MOISTURIZER...

00:35.206 --> 00:39.810
AND THEIR RACY
PAY-PER-VIEW MOVIES...

00:39.810 --> 00:41.672
AND THEY HURRIED OUTSIDE,

00:41.672 --> 00:44.715
EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT ALL THE RUCKUS WAS ABOUT.

00:44.715 --> 00:48.119
BUT THEN,
WHEN THEY SAW IT WAS ME,

00:48.119 --> 00:51.122
THIS WEIRD THING HAPPENED.

00:51.122 --> 00:56.257
FOR A MOMENT,
NO ONE MOVED OR SAID ANYTHING.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.629
THEY JUST STARED.

00:58.629 --> 01:00.161
AND THEN...

01:00.161 --> 01:01.692
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

01:01.692 --> 01:03.534
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.
 (indistinct shouting)

01:03.534 --> 01:05.396
DOES ANYBODY KNOW C.P.R.?

01:05.396 --> 01:07.067
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.400
EDIE!

01:09.400 --> 01:11.272
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

01:11.272 --> 01:14.845
YES, EVERYONE SUDDENLY
BECAME VERY CONCERNED,

01:14.845 --> 01:16.377
WHICH WAS TOUCHING,

01:16.377 --> 01:19.650
BUT ULTIMATELY POINTLESS.

01:21.212 --> 01:24.185
MOMENTS BEFORE THE AMBULANCE
FINALLY ARRIVED,

01:24.185 --> 01:26.757
I HEARD SOMEONE WHISPER...

01:26.757 --> 01:28.289
(whispers)
DON'T WORRY, EDIE.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.292
YOU'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.
YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FINE.

01:31.292 --> 01:35.226
SUSAN MAYER--WRONG AGAIN.

01:35.226 --> 01:38.699
TWO SECONDS LATER, IT HAPPENED.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.602
WITH ALL OF MY NEIGHBORS
SURROUNDING ME,

01:41.602 --> 01:44.575
I TOOK MY LAST BREATH.

01:44.575 --> 01:46.106
THE GOOD NEWS?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.339
I DIED JUST LIKE I LIVED--

01:48.339 --> 02:04.695
AS THE COMPLETE
AND UTTER CENTER OF ATTENTION.

02:04.695 --> 02:08.127
TWO DAYS AFTER I KICKED
THE PROVERBIAL BUCKET,

02:08.127 --> 02:12.163
MY HUSBAND ASKED MY NEIGHBORS
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

02:12.163 --> 02:14.465
YOU COULD TELL
FROM THE LOOKS ON THEIR FACES

02:14.465 --> 02:18.909
IT WASN'T SOMETHING
THEY... WANTED TO DO,

02:18.909 --> 02:22.513
BUT... THEY AGREED TO DO IT
ANYWAY.

02:22.513 --> 02:26.177
SO THE NEXT DAY,
THEY PILED INTO A CAR

02:26.177 --> 02:29.149
WITH TWO THERMOSES FILLED
WITH COFFEE,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.522
A BASKET FILLED
WITH BAKED GOODS

02:31.522 --> 02:36.156
AND AN URN THAT WAS FILLED
WITH... ME.

02:40.691 --> 02:43.494
I HATE
THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

02:43.494 --> 02:47.368
SO YOU'VE SAID.
 I MEAN, IT REALLY IS THE KIND
OF THING A RELATIVE SHOULD DO.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.841
MAYBE IT IS, BUT WE'RE
IN THE CAR, ON OUR WAY THERE,

02:50.841 --> 02:53.874
SO STOP YOUR BITCHING.
 (sighs) WELL, CAN YOU
AT LEAST PUT THE RADIO ON?

02:53.874 --> 02:56.877
I WON'T FEEL LIKE BITCHING IF I
CAN SING ALONG TO SOMETHING.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.879
IF YOU START SINGING,
I'LL START BITCHING,

02:58.879 --> 03:01.552
AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
 IT'S A 4-HOUR DRIVE.

03:01.552 --> 03:03.954
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO PASS THE TIME.

03:03.954 --> 03:06.887
HERE'S A THOUGHT.
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT EDIE?

03:06.887 --> 03:09.189
AND SAY WHAT?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.962
I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE IS
THE REASON WE'RE ON THIS TRIP.

03:11.962 --> 03:14.425
UH, MAYBE WE COULD SHARE
MEMORIES OR TELL STORIES.

03:14.425 --> 03:16.867
MM. WHY DON'T YOU START
WITH THE TIME

03:16.867 --> 03:19.730
SHE TRIED TO STEAL
YOUR COMATOSE BOYFRIEND?
 (snorts)

03:19.730 --> 03:21.732
THAT WAS FUN.
 OKAY, I WAS THINKING

03:21.732 --> 03:24.235
OF STORIES THAT PUT EDIE
IN A POSITIVE LIGHT.

03:24.235 --> 03:27.608
AND AFTER THAT FIVE MINUTES
IS UP, THEN WHAT DO WE DO?

03:27.608 --> 03:30.741
THE WOMAN IS DEAD, PEOPLE.
LET'S HONOR HER MEMORY.

03:30.741 --> 03:34.445
WELL, I'M ALL FOR SAYING
A FEW NICE THINGS...

03:34.445 --> 03:36.847
(sighs) BUT YOU WERE
NEVER REALLY FRIENDS.

03:36.847 --> 03:40.251
YOU AND EDIE CLASHED
RIGHT FROM THE START.

03:40.251 --> 03:42.923
YEAH.

03:42.923 --> 03:46.557
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS.

03:46.557 --> 03:49.260
(Susan)
BUT THE THE FIRST TIME WE MET,

03:49.260 --> 03:52.963
IT SEEMED LIKE WE'D END UP
BEING THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.936
(sighs)

04:01.372 --> 04:02.673
(pants)

04:02.673 --> 04:04.845
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.917
(mouth full) NO, IT'S OKAY.

04:06.917 --> 04:09.280
IT LANDED
ON THE DETERGENT BOX.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.551
HERE.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.982
YOU GO BUY YOURSELF
A FRESH DOUGHNUT

04:11.982 --> 04:14.385
OR BOOZE, CRACK,
WHATEVER EASES THE PAIN.

04:14.385 --> 04:15.956
JUST MOVE IT ALONG.

04:15.956 --> 04:19.990
UH, YOU THINK I'M HOMELESS.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

04:19.990 --> 04:21.562
NO, I LIVE HERE.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.636
I-I CAN PROVE IT.

04:25.636 --> 04:28.038
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S IN THIS GARBAGE BAG.

04:28.038 --> 04:30.941
UM, EMPTY CARTON OF EGGS,
COFFEE GRINDS,

04:30.941 --> 04:32.543
SHAMPOO BOTTLE...

04:32.543 --> 04:34.475
WART REMOVAL CREAM?

04:34.475 --> 04:36.347
(garbage bag rustles)

04:36.347 --> 04:39.310
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M HOMELESS.

04:39.310 --> 04:40.651
(both chuckle)

04:40.651 --> 04:43.984
SUSAN MAYER. OH.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.017
IT'S ALL CLEARED UP.

04:47.017 --> 04:50.721
MM. EDIE BRITT. I JUST
MOVED IN DOWN THE STREET.

04:50.721 --> 04:53.394
OH, YEAH.
I SAW THE MOVING VAN. WELCOME.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.925
THANKS.

04:54.925 --> 04:57.067
SO IS IT JUST YOU,
OR DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY?

04:57.067 --> 04:59.570
I HAVE A SON.
HE LIVES WITH HIS DAD.

04:59.570 --> 05:02.703
IT'S A LONG STORY. I'LL TELL YOU
ONE DAY OVER A MARGARITA.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.778
YOU WANNA INVITE ME IN
FOR A MARGARITA?

05:07.778 --> 05:10.711
HOW ABOUT COFFEE?
I JUST PUT ON A POT.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.042
(chuckles) GREAT.

05:12.042 --> 05:14.545
YOU CAN FILL ME IN ON ALL
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP,

05:14.545 --> 05:16.547
STARTING WITH THE REDHEAD
ACROSS THE STREET

05:16.547 --> 05:19.049
WITH THE MUFFIN BASKET.
THAT'S A ROBOT, RIGHT?

05:19.049 --> 05:21.021
FUNNY AND LIKES TO GOSSIP.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.024
WE'RE GONNA GET ALONG
JUST FINE.
 YES, WE ARE.

05:26.657 --> 05:29.560
(panting) WAIT. STOP.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.733
COULD WE JUST REST
FOR A SECOND?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.836
WE'VE ONLY GONE FOUR BLOCKS.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.569
OKAY, I LIED.

05:38.569 --> 05:40.070
I HATE RUNNING.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.072
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

05:42.072 --> 05:45.546
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A WEEK.
 BECAUSE WE WERE STARTING
TO BECOME FRIENDS,

05:45.546 --> 05:48.018
AND YOU LIKE TO RUN,
AND I LIKE TO...

05:48.018 --> 05:50.421
SIT AND...

05:50.421 --> 05:52.423
ONE OF US HAD TO GIVE.

05:52.423 --> 05:55.055
HI, SUSAN!
 OH, HI, HELEN, ED.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.787
I WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED YOU,

05:56.787 --> 05:58.959
BUT ONCE HELEN STARTS TALKING,
SHE DOESN'T SHUT UP.

05:58.959 --> 06:02.833
RIGHT. ED TOLD ME THAT.
 OH, YOU MET ED?

06:02.833 --> 06:06.036
OH, YEAH. I'VE GOTTEN
TO KNOW HIM QUITE WELL.

06:06.036 --> 06:07.498
YEAH?

06:07.498 --> 06:09.540
WE'RE KINDA...

06:09.540 --> 06:11.001
DOING IT.

06:11.001 --> 06:12.943
DOING WHAT?

06:12.943 --> 06:15.806
IT.

06:15.806 --> 06:17.678
ED IS MARRIED.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.911
YEAH, I'M A NAUGHTY GIRL.

06:20.911 --> 06:24.455
NO, YOU'RE BEING IMMORAL.

06:24.455 --> 06:26.657
YOU'RE COMMITTING ADULTERY.

06:26.657 --> 06:31.391
ACTUALLY, ED'S COMMITTING
ADULTERY. I'M JUST GETTING LAID.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.694
YOU KNOW,
FORGET I EVER MENTIONED IT.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.726
I CAN'T FORGET
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

06:35.726 --> 06:38.829
HELEN IS MY VERY GOOD FRIEND.
 I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
THAT SHE WAS--

06:38.829 --> 06:41.832
SHE IS ANNOYING, AND I HIDE
WHEN SHE KNOCKS ON MY DOOR,

06:41.832 --> 06:45.906
BUT SHE DOES NOT DESERVE FOR YOU
TO BE WRECKING HER MARRIAGE.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.407
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.039
HOME.

06:49.039 --> 06:51.682
(mocking) OH, SO YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE MY FRIEND ANYMORE?

06:51.682 --> 06:55.045
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:55.045 --> 06:56.587
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T LIKE RUNNING.

06:56.587 --> 06:59.019
WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON WHAT I'M RUNNING AWAY FROM!

06:59.019 --> 07:01.051
(sighs)

07:03.494 --> 07:06.026
HI. I'M THE WHORE
THAT LIVES DOWN THE STREET.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.898
COULD I BORROW
A CUP OF CONDOMS?

07:07.898 --> 07:10.100
A CUP? ARE YOU SURE
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH?

07:10.100 --> 07:12.563
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ME,

07:12.563 --> 07:15.706
BUT I AM HERE
TO DO YOU A FAVOR ANYWAY.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.039
I WAS OUT TO DINNER
LAST NIGHT,

07:19.039 --> 07:22.042
AND I SAW YOUR HUSBAND
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.
 REALLY?

07:22.042 --> 07:24.214
I FEEL BAD SAYING IT,

07:24.214 --> 07:28.819
BUT IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES,
I WOULD WANT TO KNOW.

07:28.819 --> 07:30.450
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.083
OH, I GET IT.

07:33.083 --> 07:37.087
SO YOU FEEL I JUDGED YOU,
AND FOR REVENGE,

07:37.087 --> 07:39.790
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME
INSECURE ABOUT MY MARRIAGE.

07:39.790 --> 07:41.792
(chuckles)
IF I WANTED REVENGE,

07:41.792 --> 07:45.135
I WOULD HAVE JOINED THEM
AND MADE IT A THREESOME.

07:45.135 --> 07:47.137
YOU KNOW,
KARL WOULD NEVER CHEAT,

07:47.137 --> 07:50.601
AND THE WOMAN HE WAS WITH--
BRANDI, HIS SECRETARY,

07:50.601 --> 07:52.903
AND HE TOOK HER OUT
FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

07:52.903 --> 07:54.905
OH, THE OLD
"I'M TAKING MY SECRETARY

07:54.905 --> 07:56.947
OUT FOR HER BIRTHDAY"
ROUTINE.

07:56.947 --> 08:00.180
HMM. NICE TIP OF THE HAT
TO THE CLASSICS.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.754
(scoffs) OKAY, WELL,
SINCE YOU'RE ON THIS MORAL ROLL,

08:03.754 --> 08:05.756
WHY DON'T WE WALK
OVER TO HELEN'S?

08:05.756 --> 08:07.758
AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU.
WE CAN HAVE SOME TEA,

08:07.758 --> 08:09.760
AND THEN YOU TWO
COULD SWAP STORIES

08:09.760 --> 08:11.692
ABOUT
ED'S FAVORITE POSITIONS.

08:11.692 --> 08:15.666
WHAT I DO AND WHAT BRANDI'S
DOING IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

08:15.666 --> 08:16.767
HOW?

08:16.767 --> 08:20.000
I'M NOT LOOKING TO BREAK UP
ANYONE'S MARRIAGE.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.232
I'M IN IT FOR A LITTLE FUN,
SOME FREE MEALS

08:22.232 --> 08:25.235
AND TO HELP AN UNHAPPY MAN
THROUGH HIS MIDLIFE CRISIS.

08:25.235 --> 08:30.140
WOW. YOU'RE JUST A GIVER.
(chuckles)

08:30.140 --> 08:31.742
FINE.

08:31.742 --> 08:34.014
USE ALL OF YOUR ENERGY
JUDGING ME

08:34.014 --> 08:36.015
AND IGNORE THE REAL PROBLEM.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.919
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.921
THIS IS MY AREA OF EXPERTISE,

08:40.921 --> 08:42.923
AND I SAW THE LOOK
IN THAT WOMAN'S EYES.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.597
SHE'S NOT IN IT FOR THE FREE
MEALS. SHE'S IN IT FOR KEEPS.

08:50.060 --> 08:51.832
YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.764
YOU KNOW, SUSAN,

08:53.764 --> 08:56.166
I'M TRYING
TO HELP MY NEIGHBOR OUT.

08:56.166 --> 09:01.111
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE MORAL THING TO DO.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.947
THREE WEEKS LATER,
I FOUND BRANDI'S BRA

09:06.947 --> 09:10.851
IN KARL'S GLOVE COMPARTMENT,
AND, WELL, YOU KNOW THE REST.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.924
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT EDIE,
SHE REALLY UNDERSTOOD MEN.

09:13.924 --> 09:17.688
I SHOULD HOPE SO. AFTER ALL
THOSE YEARS OF RESEARCH...
 (chuckles)

09:17.688 --> 09:19.029
(chuckles)

09:19.029 --> 09:21.031
I CAN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT

09:21.031 --> 09:24.094
ALL THE TIMES EDIE AND I
SNIPED AT EACH OTHER.

09:24.094 --> 09:26.096
WE COULD HAVE BEEN
GOOD FRIENDS.

09:26.096 --> 09:29.640
WELL, IF SHE KNEW WHAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO FOR HER,

09:29.640 --> 09:32.042
SHE'D FORGIVE YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

09:45.856 --> 09:48.158
OKAY, MY HOUR'S UP.
SOMEONE ELSE HOLD EDIE NOW.

09:48.158 --> 09:50.160
MM.
 I'LL TAKE HER.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.699
KINDA LOOKS LIKE CAT LITTER.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.131
LYNETTE, DON'T LOOK AT EDIE.

10:01.131 --> 10:04.635
OR WHAT, I'LL TURN TO STONE?
SHE'S ALL ROUGH AND GRITTY.

10:04.635 --> 10:07.607
UH, GABY, BEFORE WE LEARN
WHAT EDIE TASTES LIKE...

10:07.607 --> 10:09.109
I GOT IT. (sighs)

10:09.109 --> 10:11.782
I THINK A LITTLE MORE REVERENCE
FOR THE DEAD IS IN ORDER.

10:11.782 --> 10:13.784
OH, PLEASE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDIE.

10:13.784 --> 10:16.316
A LITTLE MORE IRREVERENCE
 IS WHAT WE NEED.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.189
GIVE IT.

10:25.095 --> 10:29.760
DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER WHEN YOU
TOOK TURNS DRIVING ME TO CHEMO?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.863
(Lynette) WELL,
NONE OF YOU DID IT LIKE EDIE.

10:34.104 --> 10:35.806
HEY, LYNETTE.

10:35.806 --> 10:38.138
HEY.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.309
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

10:39.309 --> 10:41.141
EH, SAME.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.073
WELL, HERE'S THE DVD
YOU ASKED FOR.

10:43.073 --> 10:46.316
THANKS. I'LL WATCH IT DURING
CHEMO IF I'M NOT TOO TIRED.

10:46.316 --> 10:49.119
HERE WE GO.

10:49.119 --> 10:51.651
OH, HI, EDIE.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.423
HI. UGH. WHAT IS THAT?

10:53.423 --> 10:55.986
IT'S A HEALTH SHAKE
OF FERMENTED BROWN RICE,

10:55.986 --> 10:57.327
AND FOR HER ENTRéE,

10:57.327 --> 11:00.761
A SALAD OF RADISH,
BURDOCK ROOT AND BOK CHOY.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.233
MMM. WHAT'S FOR DESSERT,
WATERBOARDING?

11:03.233 --> 11:05.065
THANKS.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.967
I CAN'T GET COMFORTABLE.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.800
COULD YOU FLUFF MY PILLOWS?
 OF COURSE.

11:11.301 --> 11:13.303
WELL, I'VE GOT ERRANDS TO RUN,

11:13.303 --> 11:17.077
AND I'LL BE BACK
TO DRIVE YOU TO CHEMO.
 BEFORE YOU GO, WOULD YOU
PUT MY SOCKS BACK ON?

11:17.077 --> 11:20.250
MY FEET ARE COLD AGAIN.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.213
OH, OF COURSE.

11:23.213 --> 11:26.016
KATHERINE,
YOU HAVE GOT STUFF TO DO.

11:26.016 --> 11:28.188
WHY DON'T I TAKE HER
TO CHEMO?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.060
IT'S FINE.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.321
OKAY.

11:31.321 --> 11:33.223
SEE YOU TOMORROW THEN.

11:33.223 --> 11:34.424
BYE.

11:38.368 --> 11:40.230
OKAY, WHERE'S YOUR COAT?

11:40.230 --> 11:43.033
(door opens and closes)
 WHY? CHEMO'S NOT UNTIL 5:00.

11:43.033 --> 11:47.237
YEAH, I'VE GOTTA MAKE
A LITTLE STOP ON THE WAY.

11:47.237 --> 11:48.739
(blues music playing)

11:48.739 --> 11:52.783
(indistinct conversations)

11:52.783 --> 11:55.846
(all) EDIE!
 WHOO!

11:55.846 --> 11:57.147
BEEN HERE BEFORE?

11:57.147 --> 11:59.449
A COUPLE OF TIMES.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. HEY!

11:59.449 --> 12:01.721
LOVE IT? I HAVE CANCER.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.494
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN USE
THE LADIES' ROOM IN THIS PLACE.

12:04.494 --> 12:07.097
OH, THERE ISN'T A LADIES' ROOM,
SO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

12:07.097 --> 12:09.029
UM, I...

12:09.029 --> 12:12.102
EDIE, I HAVE CHEMO
IN HALF AN HOUR.

12:12.102 --> 12:16.066
FINE.
THEN WE BETTER START DRINKING.
 I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK.

12:16.066 --> 12:19.069
AND THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO
TATTOOS IN THE KITCHEN,

12:19.069 --> 12:22.072
BUT I HAVE A BALD EAGLE
ON MY ASS THAT SAYS OTHERWISE.

12:22.072 --> 12:24.074
TWO TEQUILA SHOOTERS!
 (slaps counter)

12:24.074 --> 12:28.118
HEY, EDIE!
 REGGIE! OH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN FLORIDA.

12:28.118 --> 12:31.121
NAH. THAT WAS JUST A BODY
THEY IDENTIFIED AS ME.

12:31.121 --> 12:34.184
OH. (laughs) REGGIE,
THIS IS MY FRIEND LYNETTE.

12:34.184 --> 12:36.787
I'M TRYING TO CHEER HER UP
A LITTLE.

12:36.787 --> 12:39.059
RIGHT ON.
YOU WANNA SHOOT SOME STICK?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.190
UH...

12:40.190 --> 12:41.491
NO, THANKS.

12:41.491 --> 12:44.334
OH, COME ON.
YOU CAN TOTALLY TAKE HIM.

12:44.334 --> 12:48.238
NO, I CAN'T. UH, SEE?
(chuckles) CANCER.

12:48.238 --> 12:50.871
OH. NO SWEAT.

12:53.143 --> 12:54.104
(click)

12:54.104 --> 12:56.847
I'LL PLAY YOU ONE-HANDED.

12:58.909 --> 13:01.481
CAN YOU EXCUSE US
FOR ONE SECOND?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.554
(chuckles nervously)

13:04.554 --> 13:08.318
I NEED TO GO TO CHEMO.
I HAVE--
 CANCER. YEAH, I HEARD.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.362
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

13:12.362 --> 13:15.165
I WANT YOU TO FLUFF
YOUR OWN PILLOWS.

13:15.165 --> 13:17.567
YOU NEED TO START
FIGHTING THIS THING.

13:17.567 --> 13:19.499
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.201
OH, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

13:21.201 --> 13:25.135
HELL, LYNETTE, YOU--YOU ARE
THE STRONGEST PERSON I KNOW.

13:25.135 --> 13:28.909
YOU'RE EVEN STRONGER THAN ME,
AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING.

13:32.082 --> 13:34.144
NOW...

13:34.144 --> 13:37.487
I MAY BE A LITTLE OUT OF LINE
BRINGING YOU HERE,

13:37.487 --> 13:40.290
BUT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER
WHO YOU ARE.

13:40.290 --> 13:42.192
SCREW CANCER.

13:42.192 --> 13:46.056
YOU ARE LYNETTE SCAVO.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.362
TWO TEQUILAS.

14:05.175 --> 14:06.846
(coughs)

14:06.846 --> 14:11.521
NOW... WHERE'S THAT
ONE-ARMED FRIEND OF YOURS?

14:11.521 --> 14:15.285
I'M--WANNA SHOOT SOME STICK.
(laughs)

14:21.031 --> 14:22.192
(all laughing)

14:22.192 --> 14:25.465
WOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE GAVE YOU
JUST WHAT YOU NEEDED.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.168
GOOD FOR EDIE.
 SHE NEVER LET ME
FORGET IT EITHER.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.869
SHE ALWAYS INSISTED

14:29.869 --> 14:33.143
IT WAS THE TEQUILA SHOOTERS
THAT KILLED THE CANCER.
 (clank, rattling)

14:33.143 --> 14:35.175
OH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.547
OH, NOT NOW. WE HAVE A FLAT.

14:37.547 --> 14:41.181
MAYBE IT'S A SIGN WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS TODAY.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.183
NICE TRY.

14:44.554 --> 14:47.217
(sighs)
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

14:47.217 --> 14:49.659
ANYBODY KNOW
HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE?

14:53.123 --> 14:54.594
(sighs)

15:06.406 --> 15:10.440
YOU WANT TO HAND ME
THAT CROSS WRENCH?
 DO YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THAT IS?

15:10.440 --> 15:12.142
IT'S THE T-SHAPED DEALIE

15:12.142 --> 15:15.445
I'M GONNA WHACK YOU WITH
IF YOU DON'T HAND IT OVER.

15:15.445 --> 15:17.447
YOU KNOW,
EDIE USED TO LIVE AROUND HERE

15:17.447 --> 15:20.620
WHEN SHE MOVED AWAY
FROM WISTERIA LANE.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.954
YOU MEAN WHEN YOU GALS
GAVE HER THE BOOT.
 LESS YAKKIN', MORE JACKIN'.

15:23.954 --> 15:26.957
BREE, HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE LIVED?

15:26.957 --> 15:30.330
UM, I RAN INTO HER ONCE,
UNEXPECTEDLY...

15:30.330 --> 15:33.964
IN A PLACE
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE.

15:33.964 --> 15:35.665
BREE HODGE.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.409
FOLLOW ME.
I'LL GET YOU SITUATED,

15:39.409 --> 15:41.541
AND I'LL BRING
YOUR HUSBAND IN.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.243
(door buzzes)

15:45.015 --> 15:48.048
(indistinct conversations)

15:53.083 --> 15:54.554
IS THAT THE VISITORS' ROOM?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.356
YEAH. WHY?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.990
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
A PRIVATE ROOM, DO YOU?

15:59.990 --> 16:02.562
(scoffs)

16:02.562 --> 16:04.564
YOU MEAN, LIKE AN UPGRADE,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.197
SOMETHING WITH A COUCH
AND SOFTER LIGHTING?

16:07.197 --> 16:10.470
THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.173
OH.
YOU WERE BEING SARCASTIC.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.046
YES, MA'AM.
ARE YOU READY TO--

16:16.046 --> 16:18.978
OH, NOT, UH, JUST YET.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.482
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA,
HAVING AN UPGRADE AVAILABLE.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.555
I BET THAT'S A PERK PEOPLE
WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY FOR.

16:25.555 --> 16:27.687
MA'AM, IT'S A PRISON.

16:27.687 --> 16:31.321
THE ONLY PERK WE OFFER IS
A CAVITY SEARCH.

16:31.321 --> 16:33.423
UM...

16:33.423 --> 16:35.765
TO BE HONEST,
I-I'M NOT FEELING UP TO THIS.

16:35.765 --> 16:39.229
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO COME BACK ANOTHER DAY.

16:39.229 --> 16:41.171
FINE. HE'S GOT ANOTHER VISITOR
SCHEDULED ANYWAY,

16:41.171 --> 16:44.534
SO I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL HIM
YOU WERE HERE.
 ANOTHER VISITOR? WHO?

16:44.534 --> 16:47.207
SOME LADY.
SHE VISITS HIM EVERY WEEK.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.139
EVERY WEEK?
WHAT'S HER NAME?

16:49.139 --> 16:51.441
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT.

16:51.441 --> 16:55.385
IF SHE'S VISITING MY HUSBAND,
I THINK I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.

16:55.385 --> 16:59.049
MA'AM, I'M SORRY,
BUT I CANNOT GIVE YOU HER NAME.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.321
REALLY?

17:01.321 --> 17:05.494
BECAUSE I WOULD CONSIDER THAT
 A PERK WORTH PAYING FOR.

17:11.761 --> 17:14.134
WELL, WELL.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.165
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.268
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

17:18.268 --> 17:21.070
AND YOU DIDN'T
BRING MUFFINS?

17:21.070 --> 17:24.243
IT ISN'T
THAT KIND OF VISIT.

17:29.119 --> 17:32.322
NO MUFFINS, NO SMALL TALK.

17:32.322 --> 17:35.185
SHOULD I BE SCARED
OR GRATEFUL?

17:35.185 --> 17:38.228
I STOPPED BY
THE PRISON TODAY.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.790
THE GUARD TELLS ME
YOU'VE BEEN VISITING ORSON--

17:40.790 --> 17:43.593
SOMETIMES TWICE A WEEK,
SHE SAID.

17:43.593 --> 17:47.066
OH. WHO KNEW LADY PRISON GUARDS
COULD BE SO CHATTY?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.239
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, EDIE?

17:49.239 --> 17:51.241
I'M NOT UP TO ANYTHING,
YOU REDHEADED ICE CUBE.

17:51.241 --> 17:53.743
HE'S 15 MINUTES AWAY.

17:53.743 --> 17:57.177
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.450
AFTER ALL, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE EXILED FROM SUBURBIA.

18:00.450 --> 18:03.453
SO YOU'RE NOT...

18:03.453 --> 18:05.515
TRYING TO START UP SOMETHING?

18:05.515 --> 18:08.718
HE'S IN JAIL.

18:08.718 --> 18:12.392
MY BOOBS ARE IMPRESSIVE,
BUT THEY CAN'T BEND IRON BARS.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.864
WELL...

18:14.864 --> 18:18.428
THANK YOU FOR...
CHECKING IN ON HIM

18:18.428 --> 18:21.571
AND FOR ANSWERING
MY QUESTION.

18:24.204 --> 18:28.138
I HAVE A QUESTION.

18:28.138 --> 18:30.780
WHY AREN'T YOU VISITING HIM?

18:30.780 --> 18:33.313
OH, WELL,
MY SCHEDULE IS JUST UNREAL,

18:33.313 --> 18:36.216
WHAT WITH THE CATERING COMPANY
AND LOOKING AFTER BENJAMIN.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.888
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE ALL BUSY.

18:38.888 --> 18:41.120
COME ON.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.153
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
BEEN TO SEE HIM?

18:47.457 --> 18:50.360
THAT JAIL IS...

18:50.360 --> 18:53.233
IT'S DISGUSTING.

18:53.233 --> 18:59.369
ALL THOSE MEN IN CAGES,
LIKE ANIMALS.

18:59.369 --> 19:02.742
EVEN TO STEP FOOT IN THAT PLACE
IS HUMILIATING.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.846
THAT MAN
WENT TO JAIL FOR YOU.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.250
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH HE MUST LOVE YOU?

19:12.222 --> 19:14.384
I DO.

19:14.384 --> 19:18.428
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU SUCK IT UP
ONCE A MONTH AND GO AND SAY HI?

19:18.428 --> 19:23.193
TRY TO HELP HIM GET THROUGH
THIS LIVING NIGHTMARE.

19:23.193 --> 19:25.195
WHY CAN'T YOU DO THAT?

19:27.867 --> 19:32.342
NOW AS I THINK ABOUT IT,

19:32.342 --> 19:33.743
DON'T VISIT HIM.

19:33.743 --> 19:36.306
HE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER
THAN YOU.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.690
(door buzzes)

20:07.237 --> 20:10.780
SO... HOW ARE YOU DOING?

20:10.780 --> 20:13.383
HOW DO YOU THINK?

20:17.247 --> 20:20.290
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.952
(voice breaks)
I KNOW IT'S HORRIBLE HERE.

20:22.952 --> 20:25.495
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

20:25.495 --> 20:27.226
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.730
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO HATE ME.

20:33.303 --> 20:36.566
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE MELODRAMATIC.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.908
I MEANT FOR ASKING YOU
TO COME HERE,

20:38.908 --> 20:41.240
FOR INSISTING
YOU TURN YOURSELF IN.

20:43.413 --> 20:46.776
OH.
 NOW THAT I SEE THIS PLACE, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

20:46.776 --> 20:48.278
YOU WERE THINKING

20:48.278 --> 20:50.780
I NEEDED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT I DID,

20:50.780 --> 20:52.452
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:52.452 --> 20:56.386
BUT STILL, ASKING YOU TO MAKE
THIS SACRIFICE AND NOT...

20:56.386 --> 20:58.858
EVER...

20:58.858 --> 21:00.590
COMING TO SEE YOU...

21:06.936 --> 21:09.769
(whispers)
HOW CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

21:12.472 --> 21:14.574
JUST BE THERE
WHEN I GET OUT.

21:26.316 --> 21:28.618
(clank)

21:28.618 --> 21:33.062
I NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT
BECAUSE... I WAS EMBARRASSED.

21:33.062 --> 21:36.065
YEAH, EDIE BRITT SHAMED YOU
INTO BEING A BETTER HUMAN BEING.

21:36.065 --> 21:38.398
THAT IS EMBARRASSING.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.701
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WE'RE READY TO RIDE.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.703
GOOD. WE GOT SOME GROUND
TO MAKE UP.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.706
I WAS HOPING WE WOULD BE ABLE
TO GET THERE BEFORE DARK.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.909
HOW DO YOU THINK HE'LL REACT
WHEN WE TELL HIM?
 HOW DO YOU THINK?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.052
I NEVER THOUGHT
EDIE WOULD BE CREMATED.

22:03.052 --> 22:04.554
I FIGURED SHE'D WANNA BE

22:04.554 --> 22:06.856
PUMPED FULL OF CHEMICALS
AND PRESERVED.

22:06.856 --> 22:10.360
ISN'T THAT WHAT SHE DID
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS?
 (chuckles)

22:10.360 --> 22:12.532
MY THEORY--
EDIE KNEW IF SHE WAS BURIED,

22:12.532 --> 22:15.535
HER TRUE DATE OF BIRTH
WOULD BE CARVED INTO A TOMBSTONE

22:15.535 --> 22:18.608
FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.
 YOU REALLY THINK
SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

22:18.608 --> 22:20.370
THINKING ABOUT HER DEATH?

22:20.370 --> 22:23.743
YEAH, I DO.

22:25.415 --> 22:27.747
(Gabrielle)
I SPENT A NIGHT WITH HER

22:27.747 --> 22:32.482
RIGHT AFTER CARLOS AND I
GOT DIVORCED.
 IS THIS TOO RED? I THINK
I NEED SOMETHING PINKER.

22:32.482 --> 22:33.823
IT'S FINE. HURRY UP.

22:33.823 --> 22:38.488
I WANT TO GET TO THE CLUB WHILE
THIS BIKINI WAX IS STILL FRESH.

22:38.488 --> 22:40.490
(singsong voice)
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
 (chuckles)

22:40.490 --> 22:43.493
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE NEVER
GONE OUT ON THE TOWN TOGETHER.

22:43.493 --> 22:45.465
WELL, WE'VE NEVER BEEN SINGLE
TOGETHER BEFORE.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.468
OH, I FEEL SO SORRY FOR ALL
THOSE OTHER GIRLS IN THE BAR.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.039
OH, SO DO I.

22:50.039 --> 22:55.475
TO BE FAIR, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY WALK IN BACKWARDS.

22:55.475 --> 22:58.748
OH, NO, THAT WON'T WORK.
(chuckles)

22:58.748 --> 23:00.480
WE'RE AN UNSTOPPABLE TEAM.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.583
MM, THE HOTTEST CHICKS
ON WISTERIA LANE.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.585
OH, BE NICE.

23:05.585 --> 23:08.117
THERE ARE LOTS OF
ATTRACTIVE WOMEN ON THE STREET.

23:08.117 --> 23:09.419
LIKE WHO?

23:09.419 --> 23:11.120
HOW ABOUT BREE?

23:11.120 --> 23:13.392
UH, WITH THAT HAIR COLOR,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.394
YOU COULD STICK
A RED NOSE ON HER,

23:15.394 --> 23:17.396
AND SHE COULD JOIN
THE CIRCUS.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.928
LYNETTE'S BEAUTIFUL.

23:18.928 --> 23:20.600
MM, FOR A BABY FACTORY.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.533
AND SUSAN?
 WE'RE THE HOTTEST, OKAY?

23:25.905 --> 23:28.037
WOW.

23:28.037 --> 23:30.910
TOO MUCH?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.613
NO, IT'S GREAT.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.615
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

24:16.826 --> 24:18.528
WE'RE JUST DIFFERENT TYPES.

24:18.528 --> 24:21.160
YOU'RE RIGHT. SOME LIKE
TALL, BLONDE AND SEXY,

YOU LIVED HERE A YEAR.
HOW DO I NOT KNOW THIS?

34:24.793 --> 34:27.065
BECAUSE HE LIVES
WITH HIS FATHER.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.399
WHEN I GOT DIVORCED,
I GAVE HIM FULL CUSTODY,

34:30.399 --> 34:32.501
SO I KINDA KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

34:34.243 --> 34:38.076

WE'VE BOTH LOST KIDS.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.809
NO.

34:40.809 --> 34:42.511
I LOST A KID.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.453
YOU GAVE YOURS AWAY.

34:44.453 --> 34:47.755
AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE
TO TELL ME YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL?

34:47.755 --> 34:50.418
I GAVE HIM UP BECAUSE
I WANTED TO PROTECT HIM.

34:50.418 --> 34:52.291
FROM WHO?

34:52.291 --> 34:53.621
FROM ME.

34:53.621 --> 34:57.266
YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO BE
A GOOD MOM. I REALLY DID.

34:57.266 --> 34:59.698
BUT I KNOW MYSELF.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.600
AND IF HE...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.672
IF HE WAS
GONNA GROW UP NORMAL,

35:03.672 --> 35:05.804
HE NEEDED TO GET AWAY
FROM ME.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.406
WHAT A COP-OUT.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.678

YOU'RE JUST BEING SELFISH.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.642
THERE IS NOTHING
THAT YOU COULD SAY

35:13.642 --> 35:16.645
TO MAKE ME THINK LESS
ABOUT MYSELF THAN I ALREADY DO.

35:16.645 --> 35:20.549

A CHANCE, IT'S WORTH IT.

35:20.549 --> 35:23.792

36:01.430 --> 36:05.464
SO I'M NOT DEFENDING
EVERYTHING SHE DID, TRAVERS,

36:05.464 --> 36:08.697
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
SHE LOVED YOU,

36:08.697 --> 36:11.900
MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

36:14.303 --> 36:16.675
(voice breaks) I REALLY NEED
TO GET TO CLASS.

36:23.312 --> 36:26.585
(indistinct conversations)

36:26.585 --> 36:29.588
BUP, BUP, BUP.
I BELIEVE I CALLED SHOTGUN.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.590
GOD,
SHE IS SO GOOD AT THAT.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.592
SHE SHOULD BE.
SHE'S BEEN DOING IT

36:33.592 --> 36:36.825
SINCE SHE RODE SHOTGUN
ON AN ACTUAL STAGECOACH.
 HEY. HEY.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.401
I REALIZED...
I NEVER THANKED YOU

36:42.401 --> 36:45.574
FOR COMING ALL THE WAY OUT HERE
JUST TO TELL ME.

36:45.574 --> 36:48.337
THAT WAS REALLY COOL OF YOU.

36:48.337 --> 36:51.510
WE FELT WE OWED IT
TO YOUR MOM.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.312
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE FORGOT.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.683
WHAT?

36:59.418 --> 37:01.290
WE, UH...

37:01.290 --> 37:04.423
ALSO CAME TO GIVE YOU
YOUR MOM'S ASHES.

37:08.357 --> 37:11.500
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANNA SCATTER THEM SOMEWHERE.

37:14.963 --> 37:17.736
UNLESS THAT'S A LITTLE...

37:17.736 --> 37:20.439
WEIRD FOR YOU.

37:22.571 --> 37:24.443
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TAKE 'EM?

37:26.275 --> 37:29.448
ARE YOU SURE?

37:29.448 --> 37:32.020
YEAH.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.823
YOU WERE HER BEST FRIENDS.

37:36.525 --> 37:39.988
I'M SURE YOU COULD THINK
OF THE PERFECT PLACE TO PUT HER.

37:56.905 --> 37:59.578
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.780
GUYS...
(singsong voice) WAKE UP.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.913
(normal voice) GUYS?

38:04.913 --> 38:06.555
(honks horn twice)

38:06.555 --> 38:09.488
(singsong voice)
WE'RE HOME. GET OUT.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.990
LORD, LYNETTE. YOU NEARLY
GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.993
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO SEE EDIE
AGAIN, BUT NOT TONIGHT.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.995
OH, I THINK MY LEG'S ASLEEP.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.498
ACTUALLY, THAT'S MY LEG.
GET YOUR HAND OFF.

38:21.029 --> 38:23.532
LYNETTE, THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR DRIVING.

38:23.532 --> 38:25.634
YOU BET.
 HOLD IT.

38:25.634 --> 38:28.977
WE STILL GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHERE
WE'RE GONNA SPREAD THE ASHES.

38:28.977 --> 38:30.539
(groans)

38:30.539 --> 38:33.682
NOW IT'S GOTTA BE SOMEPLACE
THAT WAS MEANINGFUL TO EDIE.

38:33.682 --> 38:37.846
(sighs)
 WELL, EDIE ONCE TOLD ME SHE LOST
HER VIRGINITY IN A COW PASTURE.

38:37.846 --> 38:39.848
IF WE CAN
FIND THAT EXACT FIELD...

38:39.848 --> 38:42.391
WE'D FIND A LOT
OF TRAUMATIZED COWS.

38:42.391 --> 38:44.523
(all chuckle)

38:44.523 --> 38:46.825
DO WE REALLY NEED TO DO
THIS TONIGHT? THEY'RE ASHES.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.458
IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE GONNA GO BAD.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.899
FINE. WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

39:05.073 --> 39:06.545
(sighs)

39:06.545 --> 39:10.018
OH, EDIE, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO WITH YOU?

39:10.018 --> 39:13.752
(wind blowing loudly)

39:46.555 --> 39:48.987
SUBTLE AS ALWAYS, I SEE.

39:55.864 --> 39:58.096
(door creaks)

40:01.730 --> 40:04.102
THIS WAS A WONDERFUL IDEA,
KAREN.

40:04.102 --> 40:07.536
IT WASN'T EXACTLY MINE. NOW BE
CAREFUL. YOU'RE SPILLING EDIE.

40:07.536 --> 40:10.479
URN IS EMPTY.

40:10.479 --> 40:11.780
LET'S DO IT.

40:11.780 --> 40:14.082
SHOULDN'T WE SAY SOMETHING
FIRST?

40:14.082 --> 40:16.014
LIKE WHAT?

40:16.014 --> 40:17.986
I DON'T KNOW.

40:17.986 --> 40:20.889
A FEW WORDS DESCRIBING
HOW WE FELT ABOUT HER?

40:20.889 --> 40:23.522
I DON'T THINK EDIE WOULD WANT US
TO GET ALL SAPPY.

40:23.522 --> 40:26.525
WELL, I THINK IF WE'RE QUICK
ABOUT IT, SHE'D BE FINE.
 MM.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.026
HERE'S A THOUGHT--

40:28.026 --> 40:31.460
WE ALL SAY ONE WORD THAT SUMS UP
WHAT WE THOUGHT OF HER.

40:31.460 --> 40:35.203
AND THEN WE DUMP HER?
 THEN WE DUMP HER.

40:35.203 --> 40:38.106
JUST ONE WORD. THIS IS HARD.

40:38.106 --> 40:39.207
MM.

40:39.207 --> 40:41.570
OKAY, I GOT ONE.
I'LL GO FIRST.

40:41.570 --> 40:45.574
EDIE BRITT WAS SEXY.

40:45.574 --> 40:47.175
PERCEPTIVE.

40:47.175 --> 40:50.018
STRONG.

40:50.018 --> 40:52.551
BEAUTIFUL.
 MM-HMM.

40:54.783 --> 40:56.485
I NEED FOUR WORDS.

40:56.485 --> 40:58.086
AY.
 (groans)

40:58.086 --> 41:01.159
OKAY. I WANT TO DO EDIE JUSTICE,
AND FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,

41:01.159 --> 41:05.534
I NEED FOUR WORDS, OKAY?
 EDIE WOULD SO NOT BE SURPRISED
YOU'RE RUINING THIS MOMENT.

41:05.534 --> 41:08.797
GO AHEAD, SUSAN. WHAT ARE
YOUR FOUR WORDS FOR EDIE?

41:08.797 --> 41:12.641
ONE OF A KIND.

41:12.641 --> 41:13.642
(chuckles)

41:17.576 --> 41:20.248
(sighs) NOW IT'S TIME.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.653
(Edie) AND THAT IS

41:24.653 --> 41:28.056
HOW WISTERIA LANE CAME TO BE
MY FINAL RESTING PLACE.

41:31.119 --> 41:35.023
MY ASHES WERE SPREAD OVER GRASS
I HAD ONCE WALKED ON...

41:38.226 --> 41:41.930
BENEATH TREES THAT HAD
ONCE GIVEN ME SHADE...

41:44.573 --> 41:48.807
ON TOP OF ROSES
I ONCE ADMIRED...

41:50.879 --> 41:55.814
AND BESIDE FENCES
I ONCE GOSSIPED OVER.

41:55.814 --> 41:59.517
AND AFTER MY FRIENDS HAD
FINISHED SAYING GOOD-BYE,

41:59.517 --> 42:04.753
A WIND CAME ALONG AND TOOK WHAT
WAS LEFT OF ME INTO THE AIR.

42:04.753 --> 42:06.595
(wind blowing)

42:06.595 --> 42:09.097
AS I LOOKED DOWN ON THE WORLD,

42:09.097 --> 42:11.960
I BEGAN TO LET GO OF IT.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.663
I LET GO OF WHITE PICKET FENCES

42:14.663 --> 42:17.305
AND CARS IN DRIVEWAYS,

42:17.305 --> 42:21.069
COFFEE CUPS
AND VACUUM CLEANERS.

42:21.069 --> 42:24.973
I LET GO OF ALL THOSE THINGS
WHICH SEEM SO ORDINARY,

42:24.973 --> 42:28.717
BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER,
THEY MAKE UP A LIFE...

42:28.717 --> 42:33.882
A LIFE
THAT REALLY WAS ONE OF A KIND.

42:33.882 --> 42:35.584
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING--

42:35.584 --> 42:39.658
IT'S NOT HARD TO DIE
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE LIVED,

42:39.658 --> 42:41.690
AND I DID.

42:41.690 --> 42:44.733
OH, HOW I LIVED.
