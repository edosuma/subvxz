Customs Enforcement.

00:04.820 --> 00:06.250
So I'm-a get me some therapy.

00:06.260 --> 00:08.560
There's this retreat in Jamaica
that Ayanna told me about.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.119
Plenty of room for a kid, right?
Jackson,

00:11.120 --> 00:13.106
- I want all three of us here.
<i>- The Bankhead Crew</i>

00:18.960 --> 00:19.979
I might have a job for you.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.320

00:22.350 --> 00:23.839
that I should imagine
kissing someone

00:23.840 --> 00:26.029
that I cared about, I
thought about you.

00:26.030 --> 00:27.440
All right, whatever
you need, bro, I...

As long as he puts his verse
on it by the festival,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.400
I'm gonna debut it as a remix.

01:38.460 --> 01:41.570
I figured you'd be really busy,

- I figured you'd be busy, so...
- Jackson?

01:56.990 --> 01:59.580
Baby? Sorry.

Oh, baby!

02:05.930 --> 02:08.320
Ooh. Look at these muscles.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.330
Stop.

02:09.350 --> 02:11.719

- This is my mom.
- Hi.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.499
- Hi.
- I was gonna get

02:15.500 --> 02:16.670

No, you can stay with us.

Mwah.

02:26.950 --> 02:29.480
Okay.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.090
So, what do you think?

02:36.130 --> 02:38.460
I don't... It's not
giving me "solo project."

02:38.490 --> 02:41.950
It's very Take 3, and you
want a Alex Crane moment.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.780
No, but that's-that's
what this is.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.340
No, you know music.

02:45.420 --> 02:46.860
Your father's a music legend.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.270
Look, I'm trying.

02:48.300 --> 02:51.270
But between this album and...

02:51.310 --> 02:52.810
Maurice getting at me

02:52.840 --> 02:54.680
for this festival, it's just...
it's a lot.

02:54.710 --> 02:57.540
Maurice? Well, girl, that's the
wrong person to listen to.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.310
All he trying to do is
take Carlotta's job

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
at Gravity Records.

03:00.330 --> 03:01.720
He is not to be trusted.

03:01.750 --> 03:04.640
Well, I guess I'm just gonna
have to take his shady ass out.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.820
Hey!

03:08.060 --> 03:10.020
Somebody got their groove back.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.360
Baby.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.420
Come on.

03:12.430 --> 03:13.960
- So, how are you?
- I'm better.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.060
I'm not perfect, but better's
good enough for now.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.479
- Yeah.
- But what's this y'all talking about

03:17.480 --> 03:19.330
Maurice is at Gravity Records?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.600
That ain't nothing for
you to be worried about.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.410
They had some drama
go down at Karma.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.140
Was Cassie there with him?

03:26.180 --> 03:28.040
She got arrested last week.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.880
- For what?
- Damn, Cotton.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.880
For money laundering, drugs.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.219
Okay, they got her
locked up in county,

03:33.220 --> 03:34.816
but we just didn't want
to worry you with it.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.060
Next time, why don't you just
let your mama be better?

03:37.120 --> 03:39.199
- She needed to know.
- Here you go, really dampen her spirit,

done as an informant,

- I just need a minute.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.950
We ain't got a minute. I
booked you this press

05:11.960 --> 05:13.930

- Okay, yeah, I get it, Maurice.

05:13.950 --> 05:14.950

Hey, kid.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.470
Um, can we...

06:06.500 --> 06:08.940
can we do this another time?

06:08.970 --> 06:09.989
Yeah, sure.

06:09.990 --> 06:12.070
Let's cut it.

06:14.180 --> 06:15.610
Hey.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.920
Hey, what's wrong with you?

06:20.020 --> 06:23.480
I got robbed the other
night, and, um...

06:23.520 --> 06:25.630
some dude ran up on me and
put a gun to my head.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.440
Wait, who the hell
pulled a gun on you?

06:27.450 --> 06:28.460
Listen, the police...

06:28.490 --> 06:30.320
- I am talking to my son.
- Look,

06:30.360 --> 06:32.080
right now is make-or-break
for his career.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.360
And if you interrupt me again,
we gonna have a problem.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.359
Now, look, Noah, you take a sec,

06:36.360 --> 06:38.160
you man up, and let's get this.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.470
Chloe, we're ready.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.340
Pop, I'm good.

06:46.410 --> 06:47.800
I'm good.

06:57.990 --> 06:59.919
I'm just worried that
this <i> Black Ivy</i> trailer

Rhythm and Bells.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.960
Baby, you got to blend
that powder in.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.390
You can't just sit that powder
on her cheeks like that.

07:06.430 --> 07:08.700
You... Give us a minute, please.

07:08.730 --> 07:11.100
Thank you.

07:12.770 --> 07:14.670
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
- Hello?
- We have your husband,

07:21.060 --> 07:23.110
Angel Rivera, in America.

07:23.150 --> 07:25.010
Excuse me?

07:25.050 --> 07:26.719
Wh-What are you talking about?

07:26.720 --> 07:28.980
My husband's in the Dominican Republic.
Who are you?

07:29.050 --> 07:30.420
Simone.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.690
Angel?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.440
Angel, baby, are you okay?

07:33.460 --> 07:34.860
Listen to me, okay?
I don't have long.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.436
These smugglers brought
me back into the States.

07:36.460 --> 07:39.799
They-they say you got 24
hours to get $7,000 or else.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.360
He's gonna call back
with instructions.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.020
What are you talking about?
Angel.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.190
Do you want me to
call the police?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.930
If you call somebody,
he-he'll kill me.

07:45.970 --> 07:47.120
Not even Star, you hear me?

07:47.140 --> 07:48.740
Angel, what are you
talking about?

07:48.770 --> 07:50.500
A...

07:53.080 --> 07:55.840
Oh. Ch-Chill.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.380
Damn.

08:04.890 --> 08:06.690
Welcome back, sis.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.140
We got to stop meeting

08:08.160 --> 08:09.520
in institutions like this.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.800
How you holding up?

08:10.820 --> 08:12.039
Ain't nothing.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.740
I know what I got to do.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.260
You know I ain't stupid, right?

08:16.350 --> 08:19.150
I know you're covering
up for Xander.

08:19.180 --> 08:22.880
Because he loves me
more than anybody else,

08:22.940 --> 08:24.520
and we're getting married.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.390
And he's bringing some lawyers
down here, so I'm straight.

08:27.430 --> 08:28.760
Mm-hmm.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.360
You know, when I was in Jamaica,
I was thinking about you.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.030
I was thinking about
the first time

08:33.070 --> 08:35.600
you met Xander's trifling ass.

08:35.630 --> 08:38.140
He was trying to get you to
cut school one day, right?

08:38.169 --> 08:41.370
And then that one day turned
into you dropping out of school

08:41.409 --> 08:43.818
so you could start helping him do his dirt.
Do you remember?

08:43.820 --> 08:45.900
Look, I don't need a
walk down memory shame.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.780
- A bitch already in jail.
- Cass,

08:47.910 --> 08:49.110
he is killing you.

08:49.150 --> 08:51.980
He's killing every dream
you ever hoped to have.

08:52.020 --> 08:54.820
I worked my whole life to try to
keep that from happening to you.

08:54.850 --> 08:55.960
Guard.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.920
Don't let him kill my sister.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.720
Cass.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.799
Cassie!

09:06.650 --> 09:09.020
Man, I've been so stressed
about this Take 3 album.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.966
I don't know what I'll do if
Carlotta doesn't like it.

09:10.990 --> 09:12.050
She's gonna love it.

09:12.090 --> 09:14.520
There's nothing not to like.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.220
Simone, are you okay?

09:19.260 --> 09:21.890
Yeah, I'm good. I'm just
waiting for a call.

09:21.930 --> 09:23.480
I don't know what to
do about Jackson.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.379
- _ - We haven't even
decorated the nursery yet,

09:25.380 --> 09:26.676
and now his mom is
staying with us.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.200
Oh, so y'all are
doing parents now?

09:28.240 --> 09:30.540
- Mm, okay, wifey.
- Not by choice.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.580
So, how is she?

09:31.590 --> 09:34.120
Blonde, loud,

09:34.160 --> 09:35.920
- obnoxious.
- Oh, okay.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.030
So, you in 20 years.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.530
Got it.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.430
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.830
- It's okay.
- Hey, Miss C.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.219
Miss Carlotta.

09:44.220 --> 09:45.269
- Hi, Mama.
- She's back!

09:45.270 --> 09:46.900
I missed y'all.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.680
- Missed you.
- What's up?

09:48.690 --> 09:49.910
You look good.

09:49.940 --> 09:53.060
- Thank you.
- Okay, so...

09:53.180 --> 09:54.740
what'd you think
about our album?

09:54.780 --> 09:55.940
We feel like this will be

09:55.950 --> 09:57.626
a really dope way to say
goodbye to our fans.

09:57.650 --> 09:59.180
Hold up, goodbye?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.820
Miss C, we talked about this.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.469
Yeah, we made a final decision.

10:02.470 --> 10:03.700
Together.

10:05.810 --> 10:08.140
All right, I listened
to the album,

10:08.180 --> 10:10.180
and I think it's
missing something.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.280
That defining song.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.939
And Gravity's not
gonna release it

10:13.940 --> 10:15.780
until it's done, and
I say it's not done.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.050
Okay, Miss C, I can't
keep postponing

10:17.060 --> 10:18.080
<i>- Black Ivy</i> rehearsal.
- Yo, I've been trying to finish

10:18.090 --> 10:19.720
this remix of "There
for You" for weeks,

10:19.750 --> 10:21.310
- and I can't if we...
- I still have to work on my set

10:21.320 --> 10:22.520
- for the Rhythm and Bells...
- Then I guess

10:22.540 --> 10:24.060
y'all better get
back to work, then.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.339
- You're serious?
- Because, unlike y'all,

10:26.340 --> 10:27.430
I still care.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.960
You recognize this woman?

10:42.140 --> 10:43.740
That's Tammy.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.140
She works at Karma.

10:45.180 --> 10:46.850
- Is she a cop?
- She was a cop.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.880
She was murdered.

10:49.780 --> 10:53.300
She discovered money was being
laundered through the club.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.290
I'm sure you knew nothing
about that either.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.160
Don't you got some unarmed
black dude to go shoot?

10:58.190 --> 10:59.580
I ain't answering no more

10:59.600 --> 11:02.500
of your questions until
my entire legal team

11:02.540 --> 11:04.090
- walks through this piece.
- You listen closely.

11:04.100 --> 11:05.246
You got a cop's blood
on your hands.

11:05.270 --> 11:07.630
I know what you're thinking,
and I know what you're doing.

11:07.670 --> 11:08.916
Now, you want to
cooperate with me,

11:08.940 --> 11:10.770
I might cut you a deal.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.070
Maybe even can get you home
in time for <i> BET After Dark.</i>

11:14.110 --> 11:16.780
Man, that show don't even
come on no more, bitch.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.860
♪ Wonder how you been... ♪

11:30.890 --> 11:34.250
I just don't like it.
My son would rather

11:34.260 --> 11:36.290
talk to Maurice about
his problems than me?

11:36.380 --> 11:37.920
Maybe he feel like
it's a little late

11:37.940 --> 11:40.170
for you to be showing up
to be the man in his life.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.980
Maybe he don't think
of me as a man at all.

11:43.020 --> 11:44.750
Please.

11:44.790 --> 11:47.290
I'm just so grateful I got you.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.190
- Really?
- Yep.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.530
I can't tell.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.960
What?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.230
I'm just saying, Bobby, if
you so grateful you got me,

11:56.270 --> 12:00.570
like, why I still feel like
a closet freak to you?

12:00.600 --> 12:02.700
For real?

12:02.740 --> 12:04.910
Yeah. For real.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.810
Like, what are we doing, Bobby?

12:06.840 --> 12:09.510
I-I mean, it ain't
like I'm ashamed.

12:09.550 --> 12:12.350
It's I-I don't know how Noah's
gonna react, that's all.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.661
I-I don't want nothing else
putting a distance between us.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.590
I think you putting a
distance between us.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.920
I...

12:18.020 --> 12:21.190

Whoa, whoa.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.666
What's good? What's good? You all right?
You all right?

12:48.690 --> 12:51.390
- I can't... I can't breathe.
- Come on, come on, come on.

12:51.420 --> 12:52.500
Come on, calm down. Calm down.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.119
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.790
I'm waiting... I'm waiting
on Star and Simone

12:56.830 --> 12:57.930
to finish this album.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.440
I'm trying to finish
my own solo album.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.410
- Alex, breathe, breathe.
- And I need it to be perfect,

13:01.430 --> 13:03.160
- and it's not perfect.
- Breathe.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.830
- This festival's coming up.
- Come on, come on.

13:05.870 --> 13:07.140
And I just broke up with Derek,

13:07.170 --> 13:08.570
and that was the
only solid thing,

13:08.610 --> 13:10.870
and now it's gone.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.010
Maybe I'm the problem.

13:16.050 --> 13:17.760
Alex, come on.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.650
Maybe that's why me
and you didn't work.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.150
Listen, come on. Alex.

13:21.180 --> 13:22.520
We both know that it was me.

13:22.550 --> 13:25.740
All right? Look, I never
really said this,

13:25.780 --> 13:28.820
but I... but I'm sorry for
everything that happened.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.800
Be honest with me, Noah.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.200
Okay, um... you have a wall.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.140
It's not easy being
a black woman

13:46.180 --> 13:49.510
in, in this world.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.880
You got to hold it all in.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.320
Never let 'em see you cry.

13:56.350 --> 13:58.790
Yeah.

13:58.820 --> 14:00.920
Trust me, I understand.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.760
Being a black man...

14:03.790 --> 14:05.930
it's not easy.

14:07.130 --> 14:09.180
Yeah.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.640
I saw your interview with Chloe.

14:16.610 --> 14:18.710
Are you okay?

14:18.740 --> 14:21.080
I'm good.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.980
I'm gonna make sure that
never happens again.

14:24.010 --> 14:27.150
Nobody's ever gonna run
up on me like that.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.470
You good?

14:43.500 --> 14:46.570
Yeah.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.300
Look, I got to...
I got to hit it

14:48.340 --> 14:51.210
to this Afro Rock thing
at Karma a little later.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.700
You should come through.

14:52.710 --> 14:55.880
Maybe.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.100
You think you maybe have
a little time to...

15:03.160 --> 15:04.350
listen to my music?

15:04.390 --> 15:08.690
After all the times you
helped me, I owe you.

15:08.730 --> 15:11.160
You do.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.900
Hello.

15:22.940 --> 15:25.170
I'll be there.

15:29.810 --> 15:31.250
Thank you for the money.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.250
I would have never let
you do this by yourself.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.920
Thank you.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.070
Where is he?

16:00.610 --> 16:02.240
Price just went up.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.079
- Okay, let him out!
- No, no, no.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.010
It's okay. I came
prepared for this.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.040
Out.

16:16.430 --> 16:18.590
Angel.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.640
I thought I'd never
see you again.

16:26.660 --> 16:29.040
Are you okay? Did they hurt you?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.970
Are you okay?

16:32.010 --> 16:33.540
I got those divorce papers.

16:33.580 --> 16:37.210
I swore I'd do anything
to get back to you.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.680
You did that for me?

16:39.720 --> 16:41.950
I love you, Simone Rivera.

16:41.990 --> 16:44.480
I love you, too.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.770
All rise. Court is
now in session.

16:54.900 --> 16:56.500
Be seated.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.280
Cass, I can get you a lawyer.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.420
Why you bring the whole
family into this?

17:04.520 --> 17:06.119
Because if Xander
comes up in here,

17:06.160 --> 17:07.460
he needs to know we got you.

17:07.490 --> 17:08.960
Not him.

17:08.990 --> 17:12.240
Don't look like he about
to show, anyway. Does it?

17:14.970 --> 17:17.069
What was that

17:17.099 --> 17:18.519
that you were saying?

17:18.520 --> 17:20.500
There's my baby
with my lawyer now.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.640
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, girl.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.510
How you doing?

17:24.540 --> 17:25.800
You still look good.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.880
Watch it, Xander.

17:28.910 --> 17:32.550
Brick been itching to whup
your ass for the longest.

17:33.770 --> 17:35.520
Cassandra Augustine Brown.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.650
- Your Honor.
- You're being charged with

17:37.660 --> 17:38.950
four counts of money laundering

17:38.990 --> 17:40.430
and drug trafficking.
How do you plead?

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
Not guilty.

17:41.450 --> 17:42.879
You'll be held in the
Fulton County Jail

17:42.880 --> 17:44.510
until your trial date
has been determined.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.800
- Next case.
- Cassie.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.220
You need to let me help you.
You need to make a choice now.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.099
Who, you and a bunch of goons?

17:50.100 --> 17:51.419
No, come on. Cassie,

17:51.420 --> 17:52.920
I got the best
lawyers in Atlanta.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.110
We'll get you out in no time.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.320
- I promise.
- Make a choice.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.870
I am.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.340
Xander.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.120
I don't know how many
times you two sisters

18:06.150 --> 18:08.020
are gonna have to
learn I always win.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.790
So my sister's the loser, huh?

18:09.820 --> 18:11.320
But that's your goal, isn't it?

18:11.360 --> 18:13.290
So that you can watch her
drown in her own blood,

18:13.300 --> 18:15.110
then you can swoop in
and save the day...

18:15.120 --> 18:17.490
like the evil, selfish
bitch you are.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.700
What'd you call me?

18:19.730 --> 18:21.730
I'm-a send your ass to hell.

18:21.770 --> 18:23.870
I'll save you a seat.

18:28.970 --> 18:31.960
Oh, my God. Man,
this is amazing.

18:32.020 --> 18:33.410
Whoa!

18:33.440 --> 18:35.540
Are you kidding me right now?

18:35.580 --> 18:37.710
I'm just so glad you
finally get to eat.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.450
I got fresh clothes, a shower.

18:40.490 --> 18:43.480
Your friend Nina hooked us up.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.660
Well, actually, I wanted to talk
to you about her, but... Oh.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.460
What is this?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.860
When we got to the States,

18:54.900 --> 18:58.170
we had to make a detour
'cause we had to avoid ICE.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.540
They said they were gonna take
us to a safe house, but, um...

19:01.570 --> 19:04.440
but then they were just
asking for more money.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.340
And you didn't have it.

19:06.380 --> 19:07.740
No, of course we didn't have it.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.710
So they did this to you.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.680
I'm so sorry.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.300
- Oh!
- Oh. Mom, are you okay?

19:27.360 --> 19:28.830
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:28.870 --> 19:31.440
I think someone slipped
something in my Pinot Grigio.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.180
Oh, they must have.

19:33.260 --> 19:36.940
Has nothing to do with the fact
that you drank two bottles.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.910
I like her.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.880
So, Mom, what did you
have to show us?

19:43.260 --> 19:45.180
Ta-da!

19:45.620 --> 19:47.740
What's this?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.620
I'm gonna decorate your nursery.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.700
- No, you're not.
- What?

19:51.760 --> 19:53.490
You can't decorate my house.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.460
Okay. I was just trying to help.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.590
I mean, I figured with
your lifestyle...

19:58.630 --> 20:00.400
What's my lifestyle?

20:00.430 --> 20:02.800
Well, Jackson told me that
you're not gonna be home much.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.419
I mean, I assume you'll be
recording and partying,

20:05.420 --> 20:06.540
so I think I can handle

20:06.570 --> 20:08.680
- decorating a nursery.
- I said she'd be working.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.520
Jackson told me about your mama.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.440
- Mom!
- My mama?

20:12.480 --> 20:13.940
What are you trying to say?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.576
I'm just telling it
like it is, sweetie.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.450
- Mom.
- You need to get her before I do.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.520
Oh, you want to start
with me, sugar?

20:19.540 --> 20:21.519
- Mom. Stop, please.
- I got cousins

20:21.520 --> 20:23.350
who are white trash.
I know your type.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.836
- Okay. That's enough. Mom, come on.
- What?

20:24.860 --> 20:26.460
- We're going to bed.
- I'm not doing anything wrong.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.920
- Mom. Please don't do this. Stop.
- Fine.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.770
- What are you...?
- Fine.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.606
- What are you doing?
- I'm just trying to help.

20:32.630 --> 20:33.919
You're not helping.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.100
This doesn't help. It never did.

20:36.130 --> 20:38.270
- Baby.
- Oh, no.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.270
- Baby, I'm... Please, just...
- No, no, no, no.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.200
- No, I've done this before.
- Baby.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.210
We not doing this.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.680
Oh, boy.

20:48.710 --> 20:51.030
That better not be
what I think it is.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.050
Man, chill out, Pop.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.360
Hey, the cemetery
is full of fools

20:53.380 --> 20:55.100
who got talked into
carrying a gun.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.520
Ain't nobody talk
me into anything.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.790
Yeah, no, you're just being
stupid all on your own.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.420
What am I supposed to do, Pop?

21:00.480 --> 21:02.290
Wait for another person
to take a shot at me?

21:02.330 --> 21:04.590
A man ain't supposed to
run from his problems,

21:04.630 --> 21:06.330
but what would you
know about that?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.860
What I know?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.350
I know you've been carrying
the weight of the world

21:10.380 --> 21:12.016
on your shoulders ever
since you was young,

21:12.040 --> 21:13.840
way too young, son.

21:13.870 --> 21:16.410
I know you tired of feeling
like you got to grow up faster,

21:16.440 --> 21:18.240
be stronger, work harder.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.760
But, yo, that's the black tax

21:19.860 --> 21:22.480
- we got to pay.
- I'm tired, Pop!

21:22.510 --> 21:25.710

wanted to apologize

24:08.950 --> 24:10.280
for the other night with my mom.

Well, she's not gonna

leave, and she did.

Can you please just drop it?

24:23.160 --> 24:24.379
<i>I really want</i>

24:24.380 --> 24:26.560
to thank you for what you
did for me and Angel today.

24:29.090 --> 24:31.050
- Are you okay?
- I just, uh...

24:31.090 --> 24:33.390
I saw how you and Angel
looked at each other.

24:33.420 --> 24:35.780
- There's so much love there.
- Yeah.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.370
I mean, he moved
heaven and earth

24:38.380 --> 24:40.060
just to make it back to me.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.500
You know, I still
can't believe it.

24:42.530 --> 24:44.300
I can.

24:45.570 --> 24:47.970
I think anyone...

24:48.010 --> 24:50.440
would want a shot at
something real with you.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.140
Simone...

24:53.210 --> 24:55.210
I got to try.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.900
You're the first person that's
seen me in a really long time.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.410
I mean, you mean a lot to me.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.450
I care a lot about
you, too, but...

25:04.920 --> 25:06.900
Angel, I can...

25:09.430 --> 25:11.530
You got to go.

25:16.430 --> 25:17.800
Angel, I...

25:17.840 --> 25:19.940
I see why you want a divorce.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.720
Maybe you should let
the girls explore

25:26.780 --> 25:28.210
some of their own projects.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.050
C?

25:30.080 --> 25:32.110
You hear nothing I just said?

25:32.150 --> 25:34.180
Sorry.

25:34.220 --> 25:38.690
I got a lot of, um,
family stuff on my mind.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.590
They say therapy'll
do that to you.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.690
You've been doing
the most lately.

25:42.730 --> 25:44.260
What, you coming at me, too?

25:44.300 --> 25:46.800
I ain't coming at you,
but I'm just concerned.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.230
Between Cassie and Take 3,

25:49.270 --> 25:53.200
I ain't took no time to think
about my own damn life.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.950
There's still some things

25:55.960 --> 25:57.740
I'm trying to process
from that trip.

25:57.780 --> 25:59.519
Cassie a grown-ass woman.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.919
Let her make her own mistakes.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.520
Whatever bed Cassie
make for herself,

26:02.540 --> 26:05.000
- she gonna have to lay in.
- Look, I just don't want to see

26:05.040 --> 26:07.020
nobody else get hurt.

26:07.050 --> 26:08.850

want to hear this, but

are not babies anymore.

They're artists.

26:17.230 --> 26:19.190
They're young women.

26:19.230 --> 26:21.840
You gave them their roots.

26:23.270 --> 26:25.500
Now you got to give
'em their wings.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.140

30:20.920 --> 30:22.760
I was gonna have
a little sister.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.840
She said, "It... it's your job

30:26.860 --> 30:30.240
to protect her no matter
what may come her way,"

30:30.280 --> 30:32.910
and I promised her

30:32.950 --> 30:35.900
I would protect you
no matter what came.

30:38.690 --> 30:41.820
You remember those,
um, car rides

30:41.840 --> 30:44.320
that Daddy used to take
me on without you?

30:44.410 --> 30:47.210
Yeah, you got to ride in
the Caddy every Sunday.

30:47.250 --> 30:51.280
He used to do things to
me when we were alone.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.120
Things that weren't right,

30:55.150 --> 30:57.990
and I hated it,

30:58.020 --> 31:01.120
and I hated him.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.460
But it didn't matter.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.900
As long as he didn't
touch you, it was okay.

31:06.930 --> 31:10.800
That was my cross to bear.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.840
Daddy never loved me more.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.440
He loved nobody.

31:16.480 --> 31:20.280
There was nothing but
darkness in him.

31:20.310 --> 31:23.680
And I see that same darkness

31:23.720 --> 31:26.000
in Xander.

31:28.980 --> 31:32.120
But that ain't my
monster to kill.

31:54.820 --> 31:58.090
I freaked out.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.360
I'm sorry.

32:04.330 --> 32:07.730
I guess I just didn't think you
were gonna move on so fast.

32:07.770 --> 32:11.630
No. Angel, look, I'm sorry.

32:11.670 --> 32:14.850
You know, everything just
happened so fast between us,

32:14.860 --> 32:18.050
and when I left the
D.R., I realized

32:18.060 --> 32:21.080
I still had a lot of things I
had to figure out, you know?

32:21.110 --> 32:23.110
What I wanted, who I wanted.

32:23.980 --> 32:28.920
And I realized that... I
only want to be with you.

32:28.950 --> 32:32.760
And I think that we have
something really special,

32:32.790 --> 32:35.590
and I don't want to lose that.

32:35.630 --> 32:38.680
And I love you very much.

32:40.180 --> 32:42.930
I love you, too.

32:42.970 --> 32:44.900
But you know that.

32:55.580 --> 32:59.180
You remember that song we
were working on in the D.R.?

33:00.620 --> 33:02.550
I finished it.

You know what kind of
neighborhood this is.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.919
I just realized,
since I got here,

35:48.920 --> 35:50.790
I haven't even spent
a day on my own.

35:50.820 --> 35:53.000
Well, you ran away from
that fancy lifestyle

35:53.020 --> 35:54.890
of yours in New York,
came down here,

35:54.930 --> 35:57.500
got in a girl group,
done got all booed up.

35:57.540 --> 35:59.270
You did all that before
you even laid your head

35:59.280 --> 36:00.900
on a pillow in Atlanta.

36:00.930 --> 36:03.640
Haven't had time to figure
out myself, I guess.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.179
Well, you better figure yourself
out quick, fast, in a hurry,

36:06.180 --> 36:07.700
if you want any
type of happiness.

36:07.780 --> 36:09.370
Trust me, I've been there.

36:09.410 --> 36:12.200
I ain't know if I
was a him, her,

36:12.260 --> 36:14.010
a he, she...

36:14.050 --> 36:16.680
But I know I ain't like

36:16.700 --> 36:19.920
living by nobody rules,
and so I made my own.

36:19.950 --> 36:22.590
I want to make my
own rules, too.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.890
What if we, uh...

36:24.920 --> 36:27.900
why don't we go blonde?

36:33.330 --> 36:34.800
Noah.

36:39.500 --> 36:43.240
Hey, son, I came to, uh, say...

36:43.270 --> 36:45.640
Can you get rid of these for me?

36:45.680 --> 36:47.640
I can. Yeah.

36:47.740 --> 36:49.800
Look, I was on the
edge, man, and...

36:50.720 --> 36:52.520
I almost shot a kid I know.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.120
I don't want to
kill nobody, Pop.

36:55.150 --> 36:56.680
I-I don't want that
kind of power.

36:56.700 --> 36:59.140
- I know. I know.
- Look, I'm sorry, man. I messed up.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.700
- I wa... I was scared, man.
- No. No, no. Hey, hey, yo,

37:01.720 --> 37:04.940
hey, I-I ain't never gonna
blame you for having no gun.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.160
That's on me, man.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.000
All those damn rules about, like,
what it means to be a man,

37:10.030 --> 37:11.400
I put that on you.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.490
Yo, you remember that...
that snot-nose kid,

37:14.500 --> 37:15.600
what's... Ricky?

37:15.660 --> 37:17.800
Used to try to punk you
on the playground.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.659
- What'd I tell you to do, right?
- You showed me a right hook

37:20.660 --> 37:22.039
and told me to go
shut his ass up.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.020
You know, I used... used
to tell you real men,

37:25.060 --> 37:26.656
they don't sit next to each
other in no movie theater.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.830
They don't ride in the car
listening to slow music, either.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.399
Right, man. They don't
laugh, they don't cry.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.420
They don't feel.

37:33.490 --> 37:34.990
Nah, man, that...

37:35.030 --> 37:37.530
Hey, look, look.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.300
That was all wrong.

37:40.330 --> 37:42.000
It was all wrong.

37:42.030 --> 37:44.460
Pop, you can only teach
me what you know.

37:45.540 --> 37:47.160
I'm sorry.

37:48.340 --> 37:51.160
- All right?
- Yeah.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.380
Let me get this out.

37:53.410 --> 37:55.600
- Hey, um...
- What's up?

37:57.450 --> 37:59.650
You still got an ear for hits?

37:59.680 --> 38:01.780
Last time I checked.

38:01.820 --> 38:06.160
'Cause... I've been looking
for one for some time now,

38:06.190 --> 38:09.120
and, um...

38:09.160 --> 38:12.230
as you can see, I'm
in need of a manager.

38:12.260 --> 38:15.180
Yo, is you asking me
to be your manager?

38:15.220 --> 38:18.520
Man, only if you're saying yes.

38:22.110 --> 38:23.840

You did not make it easy for us,

38:52.480 --> 38:54.110
- I'll tell you that.
- I know I was hard

38:54.120 --> 38:56.040
on y'all, but it's not like

38:56.060 --> 38:58.040
you're just some
artists at a label.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.400
Y'all like my daughters,

38:59.440 --> 39:01.540
and it's kind of hard to
watch you leave the nest.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.140
But as a good
friend reminded me,

39:04.150 --> 39:05.150
you're grown-ass women.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.380
You can make your own choices.

39:07.690 --> 39:09.290
So just go out there
and be great.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.550
- You have my blessing.
- Who would've thought

39:11.560 --> 39:14.060
a couple girls that met on
IG would make it this far?

39:14.090 --> 39:15.590
I did.

39:15.630 --> 39:17.630
Man, y'all heifers
gonna make me cry,

39:17.660 --> 39:18.670
okay?

one thing without you,

Miss Carlotta.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.040
You've been our ride-or-die
since day one.

39:25.060 --> 39:26.360
And you always will be.

39:26.420 --> 39:28.200
And we'll never forget that.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.510
You know what?

39:29.540 --> 39:31.740
I think this album is
missing something.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.210
Oh, no. What?

39:33.240 --> 39:34.940
Um...

39:34.980 --> 39:36.160
you.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.740
- Me?
- Yes.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.650
- Come on. What?
- You got to go in the booth

39:39.660 --> 39:41.666
- and lay down a verse. You have to.
- Before there was Take 3,

39:41.690 --> 39:43.266
- there was Mixed Harmony.
- Boom.

39:43.290 --> 39:44.900
I mean, I guess.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.950
- You know you want to.
- If you really want a hit record,

39:46.960 --> 39:49.456
- I could go in there and, like, maybe...
- Yes. Oh.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.406
Come on. Slap your
throat three times.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.230
I'm gonna have to give
'em retirement rates.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.520
Hey, sugar.

40:04.540 --> 40:06.160
How you holding up?

40:06.280 --> 40:09.600
I'm tired... X.

40:09.710 --> 40:11.250
I know.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.450
But do not let this
case wear you down.

40:14.490 --> 40:15.580
You got this.

40:15.620 --> 40:16.890
It ain't the case.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.720
Look, I've worked so hard.

40:20.760 --> 40:22.760
I've worked to matter,

40:22.790 --> 40:24.930
to be loved,

40:24.960 --> 40:27.139
and to be seen more than just

40:27.140 --> 40:29.380
the average bitch from the hood.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.299
And all the work

40:32.300 --> 40:34.020
I put in just for
you to love me,

40:34.040 --> 40:35.340
you know what I realized?

40:35.370 --> 40:37.240
Cassie, where are you
going with this?

40:37.300 --> 40:39.580
You don't deserve my love.

40:39.610 --> 40:44.150
And my sister is the only person
that ever held me down, period.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.200
Baby, now, you know
that's not true.

40:47.250 --> 40:48.650
Save that.

40:50.190 --> 40:51.990
You don't want to
do this, Cassie.

40:52.020 --> 40:53.260
Oh, I'm doing it.

40:53.290 --> 40:55.090
I'm not your baby no more.

40:55.130 --> 40:59.160
But I'm-a see your
ass outside, though.

40:59.200 --> 41:03.670
Yeah, you are just some
average girl from the hood.

41:05.560 --> 41:08.470
We'll see if you
make it out alive.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.960
- Is that my baby girl?
- Daddy.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.670
- Hey. Come on in. Come on...
- Nah.

41:36.730 --> 41:38.900
I'm-a stay here.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.100
What's going on?

41:42.140 --> 41:44.940
You remember when I was, uh,

41:44.960 --> 41:46.080
when I was little,

41:46.140 --> 41:47.990
you know, those Sundays
you would take me

41:48.000 --> 41:49.240
for ice cream in the park?

41:49.280 --> 41:50.910
Yes.

41:50.950 --> 41:54.680
I felt like the most
special little girl.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.090
'Cause you are special.

41:57.460 --> 41:58.950
You're my little girl.

41:58.990 --> 42:02.290
You remember you would, um,
scoop me up sometimes,

42:02.330 --> 42:04.330
- 'cause I'd be too tired to walk?
- Yeah.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.700
And you would carry
me all the way home.

42:06.730 --> 42:08.060
Well, that's my job.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.360
I'm your daddy.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.860
Yeah, you are my daddy.

42:16.370 --> 42:19.010
It was your job to carry me.

42:19.040 --> 42:22.340
I trusted you to carry me,

42:22.380 --> 42:23.910
and you took advantage of me.

42:23.950 --> 42:25.700
- My innocence.
- What?

42:25.720 --> 42:26.799
You know, I can never
get that back.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.890
Wait, what are you
talking about?

42:27.900 --> 42:29.390
- What am I talking about?
- Yes.

42:30.860 --> 42:34.320
You know, I'm not gonna stay
silent about this no more.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.339
I'm not holding this in no more.

42:36.340 --> 42:39.390
I'm not letting it
hurt me no more.

42:40.300 --> 42:42.120
You broke my trust,

42:42.220 --> 42:43.730
but you didn't
break my strength.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.860
Oh, Lottie, look...

42:45.900 --> 42:48.040
You know what, I've been
walking around with your sins

42:48.120 --> 42:50.740
on my back.

42:50.770 --> 42:53.510
You.

42:53.540 --> 42:55.980
So I'm-a leave all of that,

42:56.010 --> 42:58.620
right here, with you.

43:00.620 --> 43:03.750
I hope you can carry that.

43:06.660 --> 43:10.390
L-Lottie, I...

43:10.430 --> 43:13.160
L-Lottie.
