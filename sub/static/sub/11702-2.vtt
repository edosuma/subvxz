00:01.855 --> 00:03.031
Hold it there.

00:06.901 --> 00:09.106
- Slater.
- It's not my fault.

00:09.107 --> 00:10.389
I swear I didn't tell her.

00:10.390 --> 00:13.329
- And who are you?
- My name is Ms. Ferguson...

00:13.330 --> 00:15.192
But you can call me Governor.

00:18.413 --> 00:20.480
- Who's in charge?
- You are.

00:20.481 --> 00:24.716
I read somewhere that you'd been
passed over for promotion several times.

00:24.717 --> 00:26.286
You just need a mentor.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.045
I'd really appreciate that.

00:28.382 --> 00:30.886
This yard has been neglected
for a very long time.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.559
How would you feel about turning
it into a proper vegetable garden?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.564
Yeah. When can we start?

00:35.565 --> 00:37.323
- You remember Brayden, don't you?
- No.

00:37.324 --> 00:39.270
That's him there,
darling. You look at that.

00:39.271 --> 00:41.607
That is Brayden Holt. Jacs's son.

00:41.608 --> 00:44.246
Now he stuck a needle in Debs's arm

00:44.247 --> 00:46.584
and he ended her life.

00:47.175 --> 00:50.399
I am stuck in here with nothing.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.130
And you find a reason to get up tomorrow.

00:53.131 --> 00:54.754
Just find one.

02:22.332 --> 02:23.872
Thought you were in the slot.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.634
Got out this morning.

02:27.294 --> 02:28.294
Hey, uh,

02:28.505 --> 02:31.760
sorry about the whole dunking
your head in the sink thing.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.403
I heard about Daz.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.748
Hope he catches something
and his dick drops off.

02:38.182 --> 02:41.455
Ah, Liz said you wanted to see this
stuff I collected from the papers.

02:41.456 --> 02:44.901
Yeah, yeah, I thought it might
help me process a few things.

02:46.576 --> 02:47.676
Thanks.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.470
It'll cost you.

03:06.089 --> 03:07.089
Bea.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.960
It's, uh, 9:30. You've got
an appointment, remember?

03:15.796 --> 03:18.169
- You getting back into sketching?
- Yeah.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.776
Oh, it's good to have a hobby.

03:20.324 --> 03:21.324
Yeah.

03:33.362 --> 03:35.151
This is not a social visit.

03:36.145 --> 03:37.575
I want a divorce.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.914
I need you to sign some stuff.

03:40.313 --> 03:41.819
I gave it to that guard.

03:42.563 --> 03:43.941
Where the hell is he?

03:44.440 --> 03:46.111
Where's Debbie's ashes?

03:46.501 --> 03:49.413
- Have you done anything with them yet?
- I've been too busy.

03:49.414 --> 03:52.009
- What about a memorial plaque?
- Work's full on.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.116
Work's more important than your daughter?

03:55.269 --> 03:57.572
Your husband game me
these for you to sign.

04:06.297 --> 04:08.885
_

04:11.191 --> 04:12.604
I'm selling the house.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.283
Don't worry, I'll make sure you get half.

04:17.321 --> 04:18.783
Can you give us a moment?

04:26.940 --> 04:28.747
He fancies himself.

04:29.306 --> 04:30.628
- Fancies you too.
- Hmm.

04:32.190 --> 04:34.022
It's just standard stuff.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.256
I'm not trying to rip you off.

04:36.257 --> 04:38.603
Yeah, okay, I'll sign the papers, Harry.

04:39.228 --> 04:40.688
But it's gonna cost you.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.619
You're gonna get half my fuckin' super.

04:42.644 --> 04:44.621
I don't want half your fuckin' super.

04:44.622 --> 04:46.496
- You can keep everything.
- Then what do you want?

04:46.497 --> 04:48.466
I want payback for Debbie.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.900
Brayden Holt?

04:52.410 --> 04:53.938
And you're gonna do it.

04:55.237 --> 04:56.485
Do what?

05:02.910 --> 05:05.856
Don't worry, Harry. They
don't record sound in here.

05:06.919 --> 05:09.592
You see, I'd do it myself,
but I'm a bit stuck.

05:10.279 --> 05:12.256
You're the only one who can get to him.

05:12.774 --> 05:14.376
I'm surprised you haven't done it already.

05:14.377 --> 05:17.999
You don't think I haven't thought
about it every fuckin' day?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.685
So why haven't you done it, then?

05:20.634 --> 05:23.516
- And how would I find him?
- Oh, what a shit excuse.

05:23.952 --> 05:27.131
You owe it to Deb to make
him pay for what he did.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.762
So I'm not signing anything.

05:32.619 --> 05:35.281
Not until you do what needs to be done.

05:42.816 --> 05:45.431
Take it easy. No, no,
go back to the beginning.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.992
It's all right. It's all right, mate.

05:47.993 --> 05:51.055
- You're getting it.
- Yeah, yeah, getting it fuckin' good.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.882
Calm down, darlin'.

05:52.883 --> 05:54.056
Take it easy.

05:54.469 --> 05:56.372
Pull it through. That's the way.

05:56.373 --> 05:58.911
Good. That's it.

06:00.079 --> 06:02.458
No, Franky, I was watching that!

06:02.459 --> 06:04.290
I haven't seen telly
for two weeks, you know.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.929
Yeah, serves you right
getting busted with my phone.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.101
Oh, that really looks good,

06:08.126 --> 06:10.126
having the tomatoes and the
cucumbers near the compost pile...

06:10.478 --> 06:12.467
- 'cause I really like...
- I can't bloody do it!

06:12.468 --> 06:13.678
Takes a bit of patience, darlin'.

06:13.679 --> 06:17.342
Oh, I'm bummed out, Franky. I need
half or I reckon I'll go spare.

06:17.343 --> 06:20.486
- Tell someone who gives a shit, Sky.
- Yeah, I'll go see Big Tanya in C Block.

06:20.487 --> 06:22.107
She'll sort me out.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.870
Oh, I don't think Big
Tanya's gonna sort anyone out.

06:24.871 --> 06:28.057
I saw her this morning in Medical,
and she was eating through a straw.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.047
- What?
- Someone bashed her.

06:31.217 --> 06:34.187
- Who bashed her?
- Well, apparently she had a bit of a supply problem

06:34.188 --> 06:36.653
and she got a little
bit stingy with the gear.

06:36.654 --> 06:38.225
C Block's in lockdown.

06:38.226 --> 06:39.855
Poor Big Tanya.

06:40.836 --> 06:43.098
So he says he wants a divorce.

06:43.245 --> 06:46.143
- A divorce?
- The marriage is over anyway.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.112
Well, you did try to kill him, Bea.

06:50.442 --> 06:52.287
- Oh, I'm sorry. Too soon? Too soon?
- He might

06:52.288 --> 06:55.460
have been a bastard, but that
stuff can still mess with your head.

06:55.461 --> 06:58.387
I mean, you come into a place like
this, you've got kids, you got a husband.

06:58.388 --> 07:00.291
All of a sudden, you've got none of it.

07:00.292 --> 07:01.720
Well, you got us.

07:01.806 --> 07:03.572
Yeah, but for how long?

07:03.941 --> 07:06.359
You aren't in here for the next 12 years.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.295
Oh, fuck, I bloody well hope not.

07:08.296 --> 07:09.575
Couple of months.

07:09.912 --> 07:12.766
- Couple of months.
- Ah, we'll see.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.134
Hey, hey, she just pushed me, Miss Miles.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.314
Yeah, yeah, Birdsworth.

07:17.483 --> 07:20.092
- What are you doing?
- Soil's crap.

07:21.031 --> 07:22.210
Well, there's not much
you can do about it.

07:22.236 --> 07:24.236
I reckon they need raised up garden beds.

07:28.502 --> 07:30.592
- A garden shed?
- And a greenhouse.

07:30.593 --> 07:33.307
That way we can store the
tools and stuff right there.

07:33.636 --> 07:37.553
And if we had a greenhouse, we'd
be able to grow veggies all year.

07:38.424 --> 07:39.524
Okay.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.971
- Really?
- Why not?

07:41.972 --> 07:44.137
- It's a good idea.
- Great.

07:44.496 --> 07:45.935
Well, that's fantastic.

07:46.198 --> 07:49.213
I mean, thanks, Ms. Ferguson.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.718
Ah, Doreen? I'll need you
to do something for me.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.355
I want you to keep and eye on Smith.

08:00.058 --> 08:01.058
Bea?

08:01.687 --> 08:03.148
As her peer worker.

08:03.577 --> 08:04.670
I know she's having a hard time.

08:04.695 --> 08:07.171
Just let me know how she's
traveling, now she's off sedatives.

08:07.197 --> 08:08.297
Okay.

08:13.139 --> 08:16.599
- Just this way. Liz? Liz.
- Yeah, Ms. Bennett.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.402
We've got a new girl, on remand.

08:18.403 --> 08:20.255
- Her name is Su-Yun.
- Su-Yun.

08:20.335 --> 08:21.820
I've put her in H2.

08:21.821 --> 08:23.594
- She doesn't speak English.
- Oh, right.

08:23.595 --> 08:25.833
- But can you just keep an eye on her for me?
- I'll look after her.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.486
Hi, I'm Liz.

08:27.878 --> 08:28.978
Oh, right.

08:30.575 --> 08:32.611
So you're a long way
from home, aren't you, eh?

08:34.729 --> 08:35.966
Hey, Nurse Spunky.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.484
Need a hand?

08:40.150 --> 08:42.030
Just the dirty linen, Franky.

08:43.410 --> 08:46.338
Sorry, Tanya, you're gonna
have to finish that up.

08:46.339 --> 08:49.099
You're being moved to
Protection. Can I take that?

08:49.209 --> 08:50.309
Thanks.

09:04.799 --> 09:06.299
_

09:13.251 --> 09:15.964
_

09:18.630 --> 09:20.902
_

09:27.745 --> 09:29.019
Great, babe.

09:29.418 --> 09:30.812
Yeah, I'm good.

09:31.394 --> 09:34.205
Yeah, hey, I'm ringing about Nana.
Pool old bird's not eating properly?

09:34.206 --> 09:36.976
What's he saying? Has he
got any shit? Can he get it?

09:37.393 --> 09:40.089
- Come on.
- Bea, hey? It's Bea, right?

09:40.090 --> 09:42.760
Yeah? Yeah, I heard about
you. Hey, you holding?

09:42.761 --> 09:45.548
- I just need a moggie to tide me over.
- No, I got nothing.

09:45.549 --> 09:47.049
- Just one moggie.
- Go ask someone else.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.470
Don't be a selfish bitch, Bea!

09:48.496 --> 09:49.921
Sky,

09:49.897 --> 09:52.799
- quit bugging Bea, all right?
- Nah, the fuckin' bitch is holding out on me.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.532
You're fuckin' joking.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.526
- Hello?
- Franky, how'd you go? We good, yeah?

09:57.527 --> 09:59.828
Would you get her out of my face?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.420
All yours, Red.

10:09.786 --> 10:11.541
Washington Automotive.

10:13.103 --> 10:18.223
Oh, hello, it's Tracey Bell here
from VIP Panel and Paint in Coburg.

10:18.901 --> 10:22.557
My boss was hoping to meet
with your rep, Harry Smith,

10:22.650 --> 10:26.579
to discuss supplying us with
parts, if that's possible.

10:26.977 --> 10:29.360
Sure. How's 1:30 today?

10:29.861 --> 10:32.009
Yeah, today's perfect.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.576
Sky? Sky, look don't do this, mate.

10:34.577 --> 10:37.865
- Let me open the door, eh?
- I'm gonna do it, I swear! I'm gonna do it!

10:37.866 --> 10:40.619
- So do it! Quit talking about it!
- Yeah.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.316
Sky, honey, just calm down.
You're scaring the new girl.

10:43.317 --> 10:46.287
- I don't give a fuck about the new girl.
- What's going on?

10:46.288 --> 10:47.186
Oh, it's Sky. She's got a shiv.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.552
Look, she says she's gonna slash up again

10:48.553 --> 10:51.220
- if anyone goes in her cell.
- Okay, move away, Doreen.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.845
Sky, I'm gonna open the
door and come in there, okay?

10:53.846 --> 10:56.989
You open that door I'll open
a fuckin' vein, I swear to God.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.281
Well, okay. Talk to me,
Sky. What do you want?

10:59.306 --> 11:00.624
Okay, I wanna help you out.

11:00.625 --> 11:04.209
I just need something to
take the edge off, Mr. J!

11:04.210 --> 11:06.457
Okay, we'll take you to Medical
and have you taken care of.

11:06.482 --> 11:08.482
You'll put me in the fuckin' slot!

11:08.635 --> 11:11.494
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's Sky. She's got a shiv.

11:11.495 --> 11:13.088
Listen, we're coming in there, all right?

11:13.113 --> 11:15.074
Now put the shiv down and face the wall.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.387
Just let me talk to her, okay?

11:16.412 --> 11:18.412
She's probably off her head on ice, mate.

11:18.615 --> 11:19.645
Hang on.

11:20.955 --> 11:22.404
Fuck, she's cutting.

11:22.405 --> 11:24.915
Sky, put it down. Put the
shiv down. Put it down.

11:27.445 --> 11:28.624
Did he spray her?

11:28.625 --> 11:31.394
- Did he spray her?
- Get the fuck off. Get the fuck off me.

11:31.395 --> 11:34.244
- You keep carrying on like that
- Put something on her wrists.

11:34.245 --> 11:36.254
I'll gas you again, all right!

11:36.255 --> 11:37.835
Put that on her wrist.

11:38.095 --> 11:39.214
Oh, my God.

11:39.215 --> 11:41.615
- I can't fuckin' see!
- Let's move.

11:42.695 --> 11:43.765
Move.

11:49.225 --> 11:50.525
She's sedated.

11:51.035 --> 11:53.114
- What happened?
- Ah, she slashed up.

11:53.115 --> 11:55.414
The prisoner has a
history of self-harming.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.704
She'll need to go to hospital,

11:56.729 --> 11:58.729
mainly hesitation wounds,
but one's really deep.

11:58.955 --> 12:01.485
- She'll need surgery.
- Ambulance has been called.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.675
Did you gas her?

12:04.335 --> 12:06.650
Well, she was out of
control, wielding a shiv.

12:07.135 --> 12:10.285
I deemed it appropriate to
employ OC spray to subdue her.

12:11.305 --> 12:12.705
The ambulance is here.

12:21.655 --> 12:22.704
Whoa, what are you doing?

12:22.705 --> 12:25.635
- You can't cuff her, not with slashed wrists.
- Says who?

12:26.255 --> 12:28.114
It's department protocol, mate.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.555
The prisoner's leaving the compound.
She needs to be restrained, mate.

12:30.556 --> 12:33.075
Fletch, you can't
restrain slashed wrists.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.454
You'll travel with the prisoner.
But she's not to be restrained.

12:38.455 --> 12:41.425
- Vera, can you organize a Transit Permit
for Mr. Fletcher? - Yes, Governor.

12:44.745 --> 12:46.015
What's Smith doing there?

12:46.205 --> 12:48.964
Ah, she assisted with the emergency.
She's waiting to be escorted back.

12:48.965 --> 12:50.085
I'll do that.

12:51.285 --> 12:52.955
I'll escort you to the shower block.

12:53.135 --> 12:54.455
You need cleaning up.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.215
I'm informed your husband visited.

12:58.915 --> 12:59.934
Yeah.

12:59.935 --> 13:01.815
First time in nearly four months.

13:04.335 --> 13:06.061
I've arranged a session
for you this afternoon

13:06.086 --> 13:08.086
with our consulting
psychiatrist, Dr. Lynch.

13:08.095 --> 13:09.944
Oh, I don't need to see a shrink.

13:09.945 --> 13:12.945
I don't have much liking for
them, either, but it's protocol,

13:13.175 --> 13:14.688
if you want to remain here in General.

13:14.713 --> 13:16.907
Well, I'd prefer to deal
with things in my own way.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.054
I can understand that,
but rules are rules.

13:19.055 --> 13:21.565
Besides, there's no shame
in asking for help, Smith.

13:21.755 --> 13:23.655
I have asked for help, Ms. Ferguson.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.705
Excuse me, mate.

13:40.335 --> 13:41.505
Boss around?

13:43.935 --> 13:45.465
Not sure he's out of bed yet.

13:46.105 --> 13:47.255
I'll give him a go.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.655
Hey, you've got a visitor.

14:06.575 --> 14:07.985
What can I do for you?

14:15.845 --> 14:17.045
You wanted to see me?

14:20.095 --> 14:21.675
You rang my office.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.415
Set up an appointment.

14:24.645 --> 14:25.954
I don't think so, mate.

14:25.955 --> 14:27.183
When was this?

14:27.465 --> 14:28.465
Today.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.555
Why would I set up an
appointment with you?

14:33.405 --> 14:35.276
I work for Washington Automotives.

14:35.277 --> 14:36.595
We sell car parts.

14:39.195 --> 14:40.365
Do I know you?

14:40.915 --> 14:41.915
Nah.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.985
Might have been someone in
the office who called you.

14:45.305 --> 14:47.005
I'll just check the appointment book.

14:57.345 --> 14:58.694
When'd you say you called?

14:58.695 --> 15:01.615
- Sometime today.
- Shit, I'm looking at last week.

15:56.435 --> 15:57.585
After you.

16:00.145 --> 16:01.764
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

16:01.765 --> 16:02.984
It's not my fault.

16:02.985 --> 16:04.285
Shut up, shut up.

16:07.025 --> 16:09.725
- Problem, girls?
- Yeah, where's our gear?

16:10.425 --> 16:13.364
You know where your gear
is. Governor's got it.

16:13.365 --> 16:16.454
- And you got our money.
- Yeah, well, money's gone. Shit happens.

16:16.455 --> 16:19.714
I got the lettuces, the
carrots and the herbs.

16:19.715 --> 16:21.204
It's gonna be awesome.

16:21.205 --> 16:22.875
You up for another little earner?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.874
I told you, the phone was a one off.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.015
Did you a favour and you
almost fucked it for both of us.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.040
Well, you gotta feed the beast, Miles.

16:30.625 --> 16:33.234
I might have turned a blind
eye to the small stuff,

16:33.235 --> 16:36.355
but if you think I'm gonna help you
get gear in here, you're deluded.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.715
Keep it in your pants, ladies!

16:56.125 --> 16:57.725
Hello!

16:59.125 --> 17:00.825
I'm so fuckin' horny.

17:08.115 --> 17:09.555
Calm down, you fellas.

17:14.045 --> 17:15.164
Anderson.

17:15.165 --> 17:16.675
Catch you after class.

17:17.575 --> 17:19.385
Just Anderson, Jenkins.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.835
Oh, why? Why's she so special?

17:24.285 --> 17:27.085
- It's not fair.
- These men are from Walford Prison.

17:28.224 --> 17:30.475
They'll be here for as long as it
takes to fix up the guard station

17:30.500 --> 17:31.844
and build a greenhouse.

17:31.845 --> 17:32.954
Oh, that was quick.

17:32.955 --> 17:35.905
The Governor at Walford agreed
that the enterprise had its merits.

17:37.295 --> 17:38.425
And Bea Smith?

17:40.385 --> 17:41.604
- Um...
- How is she doing?

17:41.605 --> 17:42.864
Um, good... Good, yep.

17:42.865 --> 17:43.865
Good.

17:46.265 --> 17:49.614
Anderson's in charge of the project.
All decisions go through her.

17:49.615 --> 17:52.064
All costing for materials
go through my office.

17:52.065 --> 17:53.215
Yes, Governor.

17:53.825 --> 17:54.825
Taylor.

17:55.855 --> 17:57.055
Yes, Mr. Hooker?

17:57.525 --> 17:59.095
Anderson, this is Taylor.

17:59.285 --> 18:00.954
He was an apprentice chippie.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.944
So you two sort out what you need,
make a list and give it to me.

18:03.945 --> 18:04.995
Right?

18:08.245 --> 18:10.314
I'm going to get you help,

18:10.315 --> 18:11.315
okay?

18:11.655 --> 18:13.355
Hang on. Here we are.

18:14.154 --> 18:15.254
Hey, Kimmie.

18:17.275 --> 18:18.624
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.514
- I need some help.
- What's up?

18:20.515 --> 18:22.327
Well this is Su-Yun. Korean.

18:22.391 --> 18:24.391
She doesn't speak a word
of English. She's a newbie.

18:24.555 --> 18:26.964
She got upset when Sky went ape.

18:26.965 --> 18:30.574
Now I've been trying to calm
her down and nothing is working.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.700
So can you explain to her
that what happened to Sky

18:32.725 --> 18:34.725
isn't going to happen to her?

18:51.725 --> 18:52.975
What is she saying?

18:57.125 --> 18:58.545
Kim? Kim.

19:04.205 --> 19:06.555
- Holy shit.
- Well, what's the matter?

19:07.035 --> 19:09.234
Said she banged up six balloons.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.294
Cops found those, but they
didn't get the two she swallowed.

19:12.295 --> 19:13.617
How long have they been in there?

19:13.642 --> 19:15.906
She got sprung at the airport Las night,

19:16.035 --> 19:17.335
so about 24 hours.

19:17.955 --> 19:19.315
I'll make her spew 'em up.

19:19.635 --> 19:20.864
Hey, Boomer!

19:20.865 --> 19:22.354
Boomer, what the fuck!

19:22.355 --> 19:25.564
Boomer, let her go. She's
traumatized as it is.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.825
- They wouldn't be in her stomach now.
- Where are they gonna be?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.365
Look, Kim, maybe you got it wrong, love.

19:31.745 --> 19:33.214
Ask her if she shat 'em out.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.316
Ask her.

19:41.975 --> 19:43.145
So is that a no?

19:43.146 --> 19:45.396
They gave her something so
she couldn't crap on the plane.

19:45.421 --> 19:46.394
So what do we do?

19:46.395 --> 19:49.045
Well, unless you wanna stick
your finger up her ass, we wait.

19:56.415 --> 19:57.705
- Yeah?
- It's me.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.374
What do you want?

20:00.375 --> 20:01.675
Did you go there?

20:05.695 --> 20:07.464
You stupid, dumb bitch.

20:07.465 --> 20:09.604
- Did you see him?
- Yeah, I saw him.

20:09.605 --> 20:12.014
- And?
- And nothing.

20:12.015 --> 20:14.434
- What do you mean, nothing?
- What I said.

20:14.435 --> 20:15.735
Nothing happened.

20:16.695 --> 20:18.645
And don't ever call here again.

20:19.755 --> 20:20.755
Harry.

20:24.075 --> 20:27.004
- Please, just let me make one more call.
- Oi, Smith,

20:27.005 --> 20:28.125
back to the queue.

20:28.815 --> 20:30.944
Just this one call, Mr. Fletcher.

20:30.945 --> 20:33.554
- Come on, you know the rules.
- But the girls don't mind.

20:33.555 --> 20:34.655
I do.

20:35.885 --> 20:37.464
Haven't you gotta be somewhere?

20:37.465 --> 20:40.424
According to the appointment book
you've got a 3:30 with Dr. Lynch.

20:40.425 --> 20:42.504
- No, I didn't agree to that.
- Listen,

20:42.505 --> 20:45.270
if you want to stay out of the slot,
you'd better agree to it. Look at the time.

20:45.295 --> 20:46.551
Off you go.

20:48.305 --> 20:51.574
- Any word on Pierson?
- They're keeping her overnight for observation.

20:51.575 --> 20:53.043
Thanks for dropping me
in the shit with Ferguson.

20:53.068 --> 20:54.444
Well, you were a bit heavy handed, Fletch.

20:54.445 --> 20:56.694
- She was armed with a shiv.
- Yeah, well, she was gonna drop it.

20:56.695 --> 20:58.765
First rule of crisis
management, avert the crisis.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.790
Yeah, with reasonable force.

21:01.295 --> 21:04.104
You know there's a reason we
carry capsicum in a can, mate,

21:04.105 --> 21:05.835
and it's not to spray on salad.

21:08.045 --> 21:10.123
I want the herbs along
the fence but over here

21:10.148 --> 21:11.574
is where I want you to start on...

21:11.575 --> 21:14.845
- Who'd you fancy in the last at Cranny?
- Yeah, nothing jumps out at me.

21:15.505 --> 21:17.954
Onto a couple of good things at
the dishlickers tonight, though.

21:17.955 --> 21:20.855
- And this is the shed.
- Right.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.525
- Oh, look at this.
- Yeah.

21:26.465 --> 21:28.435
Yeah, needs some repairs.

21:29.115 --> 21:30.215
Obviously.

21:30.945 --> 21:32.624
You got all water damage here,

21:32.625 --> 21:35.325
and I reckon you're going to
need to replace that whole panel.

21:36.215 --> 21:37.215
Anderson.

21:37.216 --> 21:39.066
What's your... What's your first name?

21:39.415 --> 21:41.105
- Doreen.
- Doreen, cool

21:41.515 --> 21:43.085
- I'm Nash.
- So?

21:43.518 --> 21:45.877
- What are you in for?
- None of your business.

21:46.061 --> 21:47.538
Come on, don't be like that.

21:47.782 --> 21:50.132
You could be a bloody
psycho killer for all I know.

21:51.079 --> 21:53.801
I boosted a couple of cars
when I lost me apprenticeship.

21:53.802 --> 21:54.802
Nothin'.

21:55.403 --> 21:56.581
So you say.

21:56.735 --> 21:59.424
Look, how long you reckon it'll take?

21:59.578 --> 22:03.189
Well, I guess it all depends
on how quick the boys work.

22:03.223 --> 22:05.942
And I reckon they might want to
stretch things out a little bit.

22:15.178 --> 22:16.778
What are you grinning about?

22:16.779 --> 22:19.412
What? What! Nothing.

22:19.413 --> 22:21.245
Hey, what's with you and Ferguson?

22:21.489 --> 22:22.855
Governor's pet.

22:24.093 --> 22:27.036
Oh, maybe she likes a bit of black velvet.

22:28.342 --> 22:30.013
Something you're not telling us, Dor?

22:30.014 --> 22:31.569
Piss off!

22:31.570 --> 22:32.766
Lezzo!

22:32.767 --> 22:33.767
Shut up.

22:34.626 --> 22:35.864
It's all right.

22:38.269 --> 22:41.722
Oi! Hey! Cut it out!
You two! Hey, cut it out.

22:42.055 --> 22:44.710
- You get back in the kitchen.
- Just gave a hard on.

22:44.759 --> 22:46.282
Dreams are free, Franky.

22:47.557 --> 22:50.606
Hey! Drink this. Come on, drink it.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.718
It's just vegetable oil.
Can you hold her head back?

22:52.744 --> 22:54.123
No, it's okay, it's okay.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.424
- No...
- It's just a bit of vegetable oil.

22:55.425 --> 22:58.865
Franky, she hasn't got a
clue what you are saying.

22:58.866 --> 23:00.962
Tell her it's not gonna kill her.

23:03.630 --> 23:05.695
This is ridiculous! Franky!

23:05.671 --> 23:08.094
Chill the fuck out, Liz.
I'm doing the girl a favour.

23:08.119 --> 23:09.196
By scaring her to death?

23:09.197 --> 23:11.131
No, by helping her get
that shit out of her gut.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.156
It's just a bit of
lubricant. What the big deal?

23:13.275 --> 23:14.723
Come on, just drink it a little more.

23:17.285 --> 23:19.885
Any desires to self-harm?

23:19.964 --> 23:21.811
- No.
- Harm others?

23:21.812 --> 23:24.712
- No.
- Have you been suffering any depression?

23:25.206 --> 23:29.077
Well, I'm in here for a 12-year
stretch. What do you reckon?

23:29.081 --> 23:30.304
What about anger?

23:30.862 --> 23:32.250
What makes you angry, Bea?

23:33.047 --> 23:34.629
Pointless questions.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.952
Well, how would you describe
your current state of mind?

23:40.184 --> 23:41.512
Oh, I wouldn't.

23:41.740 --> 23:43.710
You're currently going through a divorce?

23:44.432 --> 23:46.820
Oh, God, there no privacy in here.

23:47.027 --> 23:48.344
How's that affecting you?

23:47.027 --> 23:49.642
_

23:48.816 --> 23:50.453
What, lack of privacy?

23:50.787 --> 23:52.038
The divorce.

23:52.956 --> 23:54.673
Is it making you angry?

23:56.338 --> 23:58.105
What are your triggers, Bea?

23:58.189 --> 23:59.367
You aware of them?

24:00.642 --> 24:02.238
What made you

24:02.393 --> 24:04.286
attack Jacqueline Holt?

24:04.813 --> 24:08.211
- What made you attack your husband?
- Those charges were dropped.

24:08.629 --> 24:10.300
Did you often get angry with him?

24:10.499 --> 24:13.517
- Well, Harry was the angry one, not me.
- What were Harry's triggers?

24:13.518 --> 24:15.698
- What does it matter?
- If you knew them,

24:15.822 --> 24:17.642
and you kept on triggering them,

24:17.947 --> 24:19.147
that's instructive.

24:19.148 --> 24:21.956
- Oh, you blame the victim?
- Is that how you see yourself?

24:22.709 --> 24:24.772
You know, he'd blow up in a second.

24:25.359 --> 24:28.771
If I talked during the footy,
if I wasn't listening to him,

24:28.772 --> 24:31.014
if he thought I was dumping on him,

24:31.015 --> 24:35.032
if I implied he was a crap father

24:35.186 --> 24:36.977
or a lousy husband,

24:37.864 --> 24:39.745
if I made him feel inadequate.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.606
Then, yeah,

24:45.957 --> 24:47.928
I guess that was pretty instructive.

24:57.188 --> 24:59.508
- Yeah?
- Harry, don't... Don't hang up.

24:59.509 --> 25:01.440
What the fuck do you want?

25:01.924 --> 25:03.297
Are you drunk?

25:03.383 --> 25:05.369
- What's it to you?
- Hey,

25:05.672 --> 25:08.137
where were you the night
that Deb was killed, hmm?

25:09.039 --> 25:10.833
Were you out getting
tanked with your mates?

25:10.834 --> 25:12.374
You shut your fat mouth.

25:12.375 --> 25:15.156
You know the bastard who killed
your little girl is out there, Harry,

25:15.181 --> 25:16.555
and he's laughing.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.976
He's laughing at you because you're
not man enough to teach him a lesson.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.306
No, no, no, no,

25:21.307 --> 25:23.746
- you shut your fucking gob...
- You're too much of a gutless coward

25:23.747 --> 25:27.289
to do what any man in your situation
would have done already in a heartbeat.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.617
And you know what, Harry?

25:28.696 --> 25:31.445
- Brayden Holt knows it.
- Shut up!

27:14.858 --> 27:15.946
Open!

27:16.638 --> 27:18.041
Open!

27:47.257 --> 27:48.315
Hey!

27:50.938 --> 27:52.026
Hi.

27:53.009 --> 27:54.247
Any action?

27:54.670 --> 27:55.670
Hey? Oh.

27:58.470 --> 27:59.574
Nah.

28:00.221 --> 28:03.165
Are you certain she didn't take a dump in
the bog while you were fast a-fucking-sleep?

28:03.166 --> 28:06.527
No, well, you know, the noise
of it would have woken me up.

28:07.938 --> 28:10.608
God, after all that oil she should be
shitting through the eye of a needle.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.087
She's compacted.

28:12.088 --> 28:13.669
What, you're a proctologist now?

28:13.913 --> 28:15.468
We've gotta get her to Medical.

28:15.469 --> 28:19.194
And then what? You tell the screws she
got a couple of bags of H in her guts?

28:19.195 --> 28:22.138
It's gonna make her sentence even longer.
I'm trying to protect the girl, Liz.

28:22.139 --> 28:24.584
Oh, protection. That the
last thing on your mind.

28:24.585 --> 28:25.987
- Is it?
- Hey...

28:26.380 --> 28:29.106
do you reckon those blokes'll
be back in the yard today?

28:30.471 --> 28:32.906
Christie Kenny filed this report.

28:33.838 --> 28:37.759
Two units were called to the fire
at a Coburg panel beating workshop,

28:37.760 --> 28:42.888
VIP Panel Paint and Electrical,
owned by a notorious crime family.

28:42.952 --> 28:47.074
The business owner, Brayden Holt,
son of gangland identity Vinnie Holt,

28:47.075 --> 28:50.084
and deceased crime
matriarch, Jacqueline Holt,

28:50.085 --> 28:52.107
returned to find the premises burning

28:52.108 --> 28:56.267
but was able to alert the fire
brigade before major damage occurred.

28:56.432 --> 28:59.824
One of the employees trapped
inside suffered smoke inhalation

28:59.825 --> 29:02.487
and is being treated at a local hospital.

29:02.488 --> 29:04.564
I went out for a six pack of beer

29:03.758 --> 29:06.810
_

29:05.540 --> 29:06.810
and I come back to this.

29:14.729 --> 29:16.455
One of the guys who works
for me was still inside,

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
but lucky for him I
managed to get him out.

29:18.702 --> 29:19.702
Bea?

29:20.916 --> 29:21.916
Bea!

29:22.562 --> 29:23.562
Bea!

29:23.924 --> 29:24.924
Hey,

29:25.255 --> 29:27.332
I'm here to collect what you owe me.

29:27.395 --> 29:28.395
Yes.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.755
See this?

29:30.687 --> 29:33.121
I need it to look just like this.

29:34.502 --> 29:35.502
Yeah?

29:35.893 --> 29:36.907
Let's go.

29:44.637 --> 29:46.219
- Morning, Governor.
- Vera.

29:48.699 --> 29:49.862
Everything okay?

29:50.704 --> 29:51.704
Yes.

29:52.754 --> 29:54.170
Rough night with your mother?

29:55.327 --> 29:57.256
You know, I think it's admirable
what you're doing for her,

29:57.257 --> 30:00.017
but you shouldn't forget to
take tome out for yourself.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.040
I'm fine.

30:03.929 --> 30:05.526
Why don't we have a drink after work?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.859
Just the two of us. Bit of a debrief.

30:07.860 --> 30:08.960
Oh, I, um...

30:09.271 --> 30:12.093
- The nurse finishes at 6:00.
- Tell her to stay on.

30:12.094 --> 30:13.796
She'll appreciate the overtime.

30:28.112 --> 30:30.583
- Shit, you all right?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

30:30.584 --> 30:32.540
- It just... I'm fine.
- Oi, Taylor.

30:32.574 --> 30:33.574
Hands off.

30:34.489 --> 30:35.907
No worries, Mr. Faulkner.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.060
Oh, no!

30:37.486 --> 30:40.340
- Oh, poor baby
- Oh, wow.

30:41.122 --> 30:42.914
It's so cute. Buddy.

30:46.808 --> 30:48.738
Hello, ladies!

30:54.992 --> 30:56.993
Oh, Boomer, look at you!

31:05.119 --> 31:06.581
Love ya, Boom!

31:09.304 --> 31:12.008
Your psychiatrist report. It's, um...

31:13.224 --> 31:14.552
It's interesting.

31:15.334 --> 31:16.662
Did I pass?

31:18.296 --> 31:21.045
Dr. Lynch seems to feel
that if you had a purpose,

31:21.046 --> 31:24.515
you'd be unlikely to be a
danger to your fellow prisoners,

31:24.516 --> 31:25.904
and I tend to agree.

31:27.808 --> 31:31.888
It easy to feel useless in here.
You know, you get up, you eat,

31:31.889 --> 31:33.935
kill time, sleep.

31:34.328 --> 31:37.499
Days, months, years. I mean,
what's the point of it all?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
Punishment?

31:39.490 --> 31:42.236
I prefer the term correction.

31:43.048 --> 31:44.689
It's a state of mind.

31:44.843 --> 31:48.161
I mean, you can choose to
be weak and UN-empowered.

31:50.274 --> 31:53.158
Or you can take control of the situation.

31:57.710 --> 31:59.804
That easy for you to
say. You're the Governor.

31:59.805 --> 32:02.745
A title does not define who you are.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.855
Actions do that.

32:11.402 --> 32:14.574
I thought the point of me seeing the
shrink was so I could stay in general.

32:14.575 --> 32:15.635
It was.

32:15.636 --> 32:18.101
That why it's important for
you to reach your potential,

32:18.284 --> 32:19.551
even in here.

32:20.499 --> 32:22.156
To be in control.

32:23.581 --> 32:25.627
Beats feeling helpless, I guess.

32:32.778 --> 32:34.689
Do you feel helpless, Smith?

32:35.800 --> 32:39.178
No, I feel determined to make my
time in here count for something.

32:40.753 --> 32:41.907
I hope it does.

32:49.707 --> 32:51.129
Thought I recognized you,

32:51.166 --> 32:52.525
You're Debbie's old man.

32:52.876 --> 32:55.865
You think I killed her, and that
why you fuckin' torched my place.

32:56.435 --> 32:58.163
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:59.566 --> 33:01.995
No! No, no, please. Please don't.

33:07.575 --> 33:09.165
I think he shat himself.

33:11.756 --> 33:14.714
Nah, he wouldn't have the
balls to have done that.

33:29.736 --> 33:30.766
Come in.

33:33.484 --> 33:35.206
Yes, Vera, can I help you?

33:37.126 --> 33:38.575
Oh, I thought we were...

33:39.296 --> 33:40.814
Having a drink, yes.

33:42.504 --> 33:43.525
Come in.

33:48.515 --> 33:51.946
- Don't be nervous, Vera. I don't bite.
- No, I'm not nervous.

33:54.534 --> 33:56.375
Vodka and soda, okay?

33:56.376 --> 33:57.835
Yeah, it's fine.

34:00.385 --> 34:03.565
I'd make us mojitos, but I'm
fresh out of mint leaves and lime.

34:07.996 --> 34:10.705
Couple of these, I'm not going
to be much use to Mom tonight.

34:10.735 --> 34:12.373
Your mother will be fine.

34:13.014 --> 34:14.643
This is our time, Vera.

34:16.406 --> 34:18.614
You know, I think we're
going to make a terrific team.

34:19.626 --> 34:21.664
So here is to...

34:22.935 --> 34:23.936
trust.

34:24.074 --> 34:26.014
The basis of teamwork.

34:26.995 --> 34:30.135
And to having someone
who can share the load.

34:30.136 --> 34:33.295
God knows in our line of business
you need all the support you can get.

34:33.514 --> 34:34.605
That's true.

34:36.114 --> 34:37.764
- Birdsworth.
- Here.

34:38.715 --> 34:39.766
Pierson.

34:39.916 --> 34:41.195
Good to have you back.

34:42.556 --> 34:43.645
And...

34:43.655 --> 34:44.676
Lee.

34:52.085 --> 34:53.116
How's she doing?

34:54.685 --> 34:55.724
She's all right.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.495
All right.

34:57.965 --> 34:58.965
Night, ladies.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.324
- Night!
- Bye, Mr. J.

35:07.886 --> 35:09.776
- Oh, God!
- Get her into her cell.

35:09.777 --> 35:11.676
And so Channing says to the Board...

35:12.236 --> 35:15.944
But I'm GM, surely my
recommendation counts for something.

35:17.986 --> 35:20.873
Yeah, I still can't
imagine Fletch as Governor.

35:20.874 --> 35:21.915
Yeah,

35:22.456 --> 35:24.294
I'm nor sure how he'd go with,

35:24.295 --> 35:26.365
you know, policy management,
budgets, all that sort of things.

35:26.366 --> 35:28.263
Not to mention the daily minutiae

35:28.264 --> 35:30.614
- of prison bureaucracy.
- He'd be lousy

35:30.936 --> 35:32.295
at the minutiae.

35:34.646 --> 35:36.506
He's a big boy, isn't he?

35:38.226 --> 35:40.695
Not much going on between the ears.

35:40.696 --> 35:42.355
He'd be handy in a riot.

35:43.456 --> 35:46.065
- God, I am being incredibly indiscreet.
- No.

35:46.066 --> 35:49.325
- You understand this is all in the strictest
confidence. - Yeah, of course.

35:50.605 --> 35:52.495
You know, I'm saying all this because

35:53.186 --> 35:54.735
I trust you, Vera.

35:56.064 --> 35:58.324
You know, I feel like I can depend on you.

35:59.876 --> 36:01.474
God, it good

36:02.094 --> 36:04.056
to debrief with someone, isn't it?

36:05.195 --> 36:06.404
Want another drink?

36:09.014 --> 36:12.336
- Just one more?
- Yeah, come on. Come on, let's do it.

36:47.146 --> 36:48.216
Oi!

36:48.726 --> 36:50.254
Oi, stay awake.

36:50.255 --> 36:51.305
Awake.

36:51.406 --> 36:53.616
The sooner you shit, the
sooner we can get some sleep.

36:53.641 --> 36:55.385
Cut the bitch open, Franky.

36:55.386 --> 36:57.506
Come on, that's one way to get it out.

37:00.576 --> 37:01.844
Oh, grow up.

37:02.154 --> 37:02.974
Here you go, darling.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
It's just some warm water. It
might make you feel better, hey?

37:05.225 --> 37:06.864
- Have some.
- What is going on?

37:07.415 --> 37:09.854
- Nothing, Doreen. I don't want you
involved in this. - Involved in what?

37:09.855 --> 37:11.443
Su-Yun is not feeling well.

37:11.444 --> 37:14.784
- So get her to Medical...
- It not a problem Medical can fix.

37:14.785 --> 37:17.634
Dor, just leave it with
me. I'm dealing with it.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.875
Fine, right? Fine.

37:22.756 --> 37:25.805
It's all right, darling.
It's all right, darling.

37:29.536 --> 37:31.746
I was awful. It was

37:32.936 --> 37:35.235
the worst moment of my life.

37:35.236 --> 37:37.423
You know I had my suspicions
about you and Mr. Fletcher,

37:37.448 --> 37:39.135
but I had no idea that you'd been...

37:39.136 --> 37:41.027
Oh, it all in the past now. It's...

37:41.146 --> 37:43.455
- Well, what happened?
- Nothing. Nothing.

37:44.726 --> 37:45.775
Vera!

37:47.096 --> 37:48.956
Hey, what happened to trust?

37:51.184 --> 37:52.215
I mean,

37:52.216 --> 37:54.664
I confided in you because I trust you.

37:56.854 --> 37:59.674
I'm, I'm not sure I can
effectively mentor you

37:59.675 --> 38:01.605
if that trust isn't reciprocated.

38:05.515 --> 38:06.546
No...

38:07.121 --> 38:08.124
No.

38:09.966 --> 38:10.995
Never mind.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.766
There was, I found a...

38:20.275 --> 38:22.275
a journal. Fletcher's journal.

38:23.296 --> 38:25.165
- You were snooping?
- No!

38:25.466 --> 38:26.506
Yes.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.854
So, so, what was in this...

38:30.135 --> 38:31.145
this journal?

38:31.246 --> 38:33.195
Mr. Fletcher's fantasies?

38:33.816 --> 38:35.566
His darkest secrets?

38:37.014 --> 38:38.626
There was some stuff

38:39.626 --> 38:41.105
about him

38:41.756 --> 38:43.164
and a previous Governor.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.405
Meg Jackson.

38:48.044 --> 38:49.926
Just breathe, honey.

38:50.354 --> 38:54.433
Oh, she's deliberately holding onto it.
Bitch is hoarding the cheese for herself.

38:54.434 --> 38:57.983
You know as well as I do if
this thing bursts, she's stuffed.

38:57.984 --> 38:59.603
So tell her to shit it out.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.675
She is trying. Can't
you see she's exhausted?

39:02.676 --> 39:04.535
This has gone on for too
long. I'm getting help.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.754
You gonna do that, you
know what will happen.

39:05.755 --> 39:08.274
- Oh, what are you doing this for, Franky?
- I need the gear.

39:08.275 --> 39:11.056
- You don't need the gear.
- Fuck it. I'm cutting her open.

39:12.135 --> 39:13.695
- Sky!
- Sky!

39:15.935 --> 39:18.066
Cut her and I'll cut more
than your fuckin' wrists!

39:26.665 --> 39:28.075
Franky, get some help!

39:28.076 --> 39:29.165
Help her!

39:30.005 --> 39:31.873
Go and get some help!

39:31.874 --> 39:34.255
Okay, darling, it's okay.

39:34.256 --> 39:35.706
Okay, it's all right.

39:35.753 --> 39:36.824
Fuck.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.085
Fuck!

39:40.206 --> 39:41.226
Gosh...

39:43.155 --> 39:44.654
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

39:45.956 --> 39:47.394
I'm sorry.

39:48.536 --> 39:49.835
I'm sorry.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.773
I'm sorry, Su-Yun.

39:51.774 --> 39:54.506
So sorry, so sorry.

39:54.946 --> 39:56.716
I'm sorry, darling.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.094
Speak.

41:04.646 --> 41:05.714
Governor.

41:06.716 --> 41:09.203
It's midnight. This better be worth it.

41:09.204 --> 41:11.114
I promised you an exclusive.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.985
There's been a death in custody?

41:19.295 --> 41:22.035
Unfortunately, a prisoner
passed away here tonight.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.594
But it was police
ineptitude that killed her.

41:26.676 --> 41:29.046
I know I can count on
you to report the facts.

41:59.055 --> 42:00.936
I don't get how you could do that.

42:01.604 --> 42:02.814
I wasn't the only one there.

42:02.815 --> 42:05.195
You treated that girl
like a piece of meat.

42:05.536 --> 42:07.165
You're not that person, Franky.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.635
I'm whatever person I need to be.

42:08.636 --> 42:11.965
When Jacs was alive and
you wanted to take her down,

42:12.055 --> 42:15.594
you got her in the end
'cause you used your smarts.

42:15.595 --> 42:18.174
No. I beat Jacs 'cause Bea killed her.

42:18.645 --> 42:20.084
Oh, you would have had
her done before that.

42:20.085 --> 42:21.114
Yeah.

42:21.115 --> 42:24.394
Well, there's a difference between
wanting to be top dog and being it, Liz.

42:24.476 --> 42:26.030
It's not something you'll ever understand.

42:26.055 --> 42:27.772
Oh, I do understand, darling.

42:29.245 --> 42:32.785
You're a frightened little kid paddling
out of your depth. You're shit scared.

42:32.786 --> 42:35.621
You've swum out too far and you're
not gonna make it back to shore

42:35.646 --> 42:37.525
and do you know what?

42:37.526 --> 42:38.595
I don't reckon you can.

42:38.596 --> 42:40.675
- Is that right?
- You've gone too far, Franky.

42:40.765 --> 42:44.534
I'll go as far as I fuckin' have
to, and as far as I fuckin' like.

42:44.666 --> 42:47.844
Now you remember that if you don't want
to end up like your little drug mule.

42:49.235 --> 42:51.734
You'd better remember who
you're talking to now, Liz.

42:54.176 --> 42:55.464
Yeah, right.

42:56.334 --> 42:57.395
Go.

43:43.436 --> 43:44.555
I had...

43:46.195 --> 43:47.965
I had an accident at work.

43:52.846 --> 43:54.486
Look, I came, all right?

43:54.544 --> 43:56.624
Just give me the fuckin' papers.

43:58.635 --> 43:59.965
I'm done, Bea.

44:13.376 --> 44:14.535
Signed it all.

44:14.536 --> 44:17.076
Divorce, deed to the house, everything.

44:19.775 --> 44:22.005
I should have known you
wouldn't be up to it.

44:23.025 --> 44:24.546
It's not your fault.

44:25.426 --> 44:27.265
It's just the way you were built.

44:27.944 --> 44:29.744
I'm stronger than you, Harry.

44:31.144 --> 44:32.824
So I'm gonna do it myself.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.229
How're you gonna do that?

44:37.175 --> 44:40.935
There's 12-foot walls and razor
wire between you and Brayden Holt.

45:08.156 --> 45:10.384
Police believe that the
fire was deliberately lit.

45:10.385 --> 45:12.044
Do you think it was aimed at you?

45:12.964 --> 45:14.605
Why would it be aimed at me?
