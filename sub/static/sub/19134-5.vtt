12:40.800 --> 12:42.833
What?

12:42.868 --> 12:48.639
I just--I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

12:48.674 --> 12:51.875
Yes.

12:51.911 --> 12:54.578
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

12:54.613 --> 12:57.014
No, I don't.

12:57.049 --> 12:59.817
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

12:59.852 --> 13:02.286
and then you went and did it.

13:02.321 --> 13:04.588
It was just a tiny spell.

13:04.623 --> 13:06.390
There are a lot
of companies like this.

13:06.425 --> 13:08.659
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

13:10.796 --> 13:12.463
[sighs]

13:12.498 --> 13:13.897
Okay.

13:19.004 --> 13:21.772
[mouse clicking]

13:31.484 --> 13:32.850
<i>They're useless, right?</i>

13:32.885 --> 13:36.820
Well, maybe not useless.

13:39.558 --> 13:42.393
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

13:42.428 --> 13:44.094
rub away a lonely night.

13:44.130 --> 13:45.496
Okay, but for magic?

13:45.531 --> 13:47.398
For magic? Useless.

13:49.802 --> 13:51.769
How was your travel?

13:51.804 --> 13:53.937
Fine.

13:53.973 --> 13:57.107
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

13:57.143 --> 13:59.076
Some might call that blessing.

13:59.111 --> 14:01.612
Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so--

14:01.647 --> 14:03.547
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

14:03.582 --> 14:05.315
I can help you.

14:05.351 --> 14:08.452
But first, your end of deal.

14:18.497 --> 14:20.597
Take out all the knots.

14:22.902 --> 14:25.936
What the hell?

14:25.971 --> 14:30.140
- Ms. Wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

14:30.176 --> 14:33.577
The test was positive.

14:33.612 --> 14:36.113
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

14:36.148 --> 14:38.649
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

14:38.684 --> 14:40.818
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

14:40.853 --> 14:43.921
Great. Uh, today?

14:43.956 --> 14:45.689
Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

14:45.724 --> 14:47.424
but it should just be
a couple of days.

14:47.460 --> 14:50.527
Days?

14:50.563 --> 14:53.163
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

14:53.199 --> 14:55.666
Please, I--

14:57.603 --> 15:02.639
If I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

15:02.675 --> 15:04.508
Julia, you're safe here.

15:04.543 --> 15:06.910
You can talk about
what happened.

15:06.946 --> 15:11.515
- No one is above the law.
- [laughs]

15:11.550 --> 15:13.784
Ah, sorry.

15:13.819 --> 15:17.554
I wish that were true.

15:17.590 --> 15:20.023
Look, I just want this
to be over,

15:20.059 --> 15:23.527
and you can help me.

15:23.562 --> 15:26.463
Please.

15:26.499 --> 15:28.532
Okay.

15:28.567 --> 15:30.868
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

15:30.903 --> 15:34.004
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

15:34.039 --> 15:36.473
We open at 8:00.

15:36.509 --> 15:39.610
- Thank you.
- See you then.

15:43.549 --> 15:44.815
[door clicks closed]

15:50.763 --> 15:51.696
Hi.

15:51.732 --> 15:53.131
Leave.

15:53.167 --> 15:55.734
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

15:55.769 --> 15:58.036
Uh, because
you're in our castle.

15:58.071 --> 16:00.205
Which is on my land.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.974
Uh, excuse me, my manners.

16:03.010 --> 16:04.910
I'm Eliot, High King of Fillory.

16:04.945 --> 16:09.814
And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

16:09.850 --> 16:12.083
A FU fighter.

16:12.119 --> 16:14.953
- Did you say, "Foo Fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

16:14.988 --> 16:18.290
We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.992
Okay, tell Ember.

16:21.028 --> 16:22.260
He issued the decree.

16:22.296 --> 16:25.197
We will execute
every child of Earth

16:25.232 --> 16:28.767
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

16:28.802 --> 16:31.670
- [laughs]
- And yet, you laugh.

16:33.907 --> 16:36.241
- I mean, a Foo Fighter?
- Margo.

16:36.276 --> 16:40.111
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

16:40.147 --> 16:42.147
Shit.

16:42.182 --> 16:44.115
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

16:44.151 --> 16:46.284
a political insurgency?

16:46.320 --> 16:49.254
Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

16:49.289 --> 16:50.922
- First for me.
- Same.

16:50.958 --> 16:53.225
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.026
Like, study?

16:55.062 --> 16:56.962
I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills Library.

16:56.997 --> 16:58.263
[groans] Fine.

16:58.298 --> 17:01.099
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

17:09.643 --> 17:13.278
Okay, I'm done.

17:13.313 --> 17:15.914
Oh, shit! What?
Do not--don't--please--

17:15.949 --> 17:17.648
don't sneak up on me like that.

17:17.684 --> 17:19.184
This is my house.

17:19.219 --> 17:21.051
Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

17:21.088 --> 17:22.253
You gonna teach me now?

17:22.289 --> 17:24.888
You finish first step.

17:24.925 --> 17:28.159
Next...the table.

17:30.897 --> 17:32.397
What about it?

17:32.432 --> 17:34.766
You make it sawdust.

17:34.801 --> 17:39.170
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

17:39.206 --> 17:41.239
Enjoy.

17:46.246 --> 17:47.846
[sputters]

17:54.454 --> 17:57.455
What are you still doing here?

17:57.491 --> 17:59.391
I'm just finishing up.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.992
Gonna jerk it?

18:01.028 --> 18:02.861
- Break in the office?
- No.

18:02.896 --> 18:03.995
What? No, I'm--

18:04.031 --> 18:05.163
It's the only place I can.

18:05.198 --> 18:08.867
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

18:08.902 --> 18:11.936
I'm not doing that...

18:11.972 --> 18:13.071
here.

18:13.106 --> 18:15.140
Just saying.
It's no judgment.

18:15.175 --> 18:17.809
Adios.

18:17.844 --> 18:19.377
[door rattles closed]

18:21.815 --> 18:25.283
I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

18:25.319 --> 18:28.019
Could you knock, please?

18:28.055 --> 18:29.421
[knocks]

18:29.456 --> 18:31.423
What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

18:31.458 --> 18:33.024
No!

18:33.060 --> 18:35.093
Whatever. I do.

18:35.128 --> 18:36.961
What is this place?

18:36.997 --> 18:38.763
[sighs]

18:41.335 --> 18:43.234
I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, I--

18:43.270 --> 18:46.938
I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

18:46.973 --> 18:51.743
It was just a stupid spell.

18:51.778 --> 18:53.244
Thank you.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.879
Want some?

18:54.915 --> 18:56.915
Vodka. Bit of lime.

19:01.955 --> 19:03.788
You should stay.

19:03.824 --> 19:04.989
Forget what I said earlier.

19:05.025 --> 19:09.361
I think we'd be good friends.

19:09.396 --> 19:11.896
I would like that.

19:11.932 --> 19:13.965
What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.368
Right?
Let's get out of here.

19:16.403 --> 19:17.736
- Mm.
- Finish that.

19:17.771 --> 19:19.804
- Come on.
- Okay.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.339
Yes!

19:21.375 --> 19:24.376
[file scraping]

19:28.215 --> 19:29.948
Take a break.

19:31.451 --> 19:33.818
No trick, no test.
I promise.

19:42.295 --> 19:43.828
That's it?

19:43.864 --> 19:46.998
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

19:49.903 --> 19:51.936
No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

19:51.972 --> 19:53.304
then we have to call it
what it is.

19:53.340 --> 19:55.240
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

19:55.275 --> 19:57.342
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

19:57.377 --> 19:59.544
Reynard set us up.

19:59.579 --> 20:01.546
Yeah, but I should have
known better.

20:01.581 --> 20:05.450
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

20:05.485 --> 20:09.354
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

20:09.389 --> 20:13.992
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save--

20:14.027 --> 20:16.961
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

20:16.997 --> 20:19.531
Look, there is
one way through this,

20:19.566 --> 20:23.034
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

20:23.069 --> 20:24.969
Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

20:25.005 --> 20:28.440
Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

20:28.475 --> 20:30.875
and that's next on the list.

20:30.911 --> 20:33.244
I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.281
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

20:36.316 --> 20:39.417
I've had to deal with in months.

20:39.453 --> 20:41.453
But I am nervous.

20:46.126 --> 20:48.593
I had one.

20:51.932 --> 20:54.265
He was a drummer.

20:56.303 --> 20:59.003
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

21:01.007 --> 21:02.941
But--

21:02.976 --> 21:07.378
I--I remember the night before.

21:07.414 --> 21:10.415
It--I felt...

21:12.519 --> 21:14.319
I felt lonely.

21:17.257 --> 21:19.023
Yeah.

21:19.059 --> 21:21.893
But you're not alone.

21:21.928 --> 21:23.928
I'm your best bitch, remember?

21:26.533 --> 21:28.233
Yeah.

21:28.268 --> 21:31.603
Okay, your turn.
Truth or dare.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.439
Truth.

21:34.474 --> 21:36.407
Do you still blame yourself?

21:36.443 --> 21:39.143
Shit. Okay.

21:39.179 --> 21:40.545
Sorry, no.

21:40.580 --> 21:43.515
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.316
Was that a sentence?

21:45.352 --> 21:48.419
No, I said truth.

21:48.455 --> 21:52.657
So do you know what happened?

21:52.692 --> 21:54.259
I mean, just what Alice told me.

21:54.294 --> 21:58.096
That you changed your face
for a professor

21:58.131 --> 22:01.466
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

22:01.501 --> 22:03.535
Yeah, that's the gist.

22:03.570 --> 22:07.305
How is Alice?

22:07.340 --> 22:09.440
Uh, Alice is dead.

22:20.554 --> 22:23.221
I don't blame myself.

22:23.256 --> 22:26.958
Except for when
I first wake up...

22:26.993 --> 22:28.593
and when I go to bed

22:28.628 --> 22:33.464
and all the time in between.

22:37.737 --> 22:39.737
Your turn.

22:42.275 --> 22:44.108
Dare.

22:44.144 --> 22:45.777
Dare.

22:47.113 --> 22:48.346
[laughs]

22:48.381 --> 22:49.547
[laughs]

22:49.583 --> 22:51.149
My dare is to smoke weed?

22:51.184 --> 22:53.518
It's very middle school.

22:56.489 --> 22:58.723
Oh, oh.

22:58.758 --> 23:01.125
Do you know--

23:01.161 --> 23:02.660
do you know Weizenheim's Third?

23:02.696 --> 23:05.296
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

23:05.332 --> 23:07.432
- I thought you didn't--
- I don't.

23:07.467 --> 23:09.133
This doesn't count.

23:09.169 --> 23:10.401
Today's a cheat day.

23:10.437 --> 23:13.237
Right.

23:13.273 --> 23:16.708
Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

23:28.722 --> 23:31.723
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.124
Your turn.

23:33.159 --> 23:34.592
Don't, like, burn yourself.

23:34.628 --> 23:36.628
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

23:36.663 --> 23:38.062
Okay, let me.

23:57.183 --> 23:58.549
[laughs]

23:58.585 --> 24:00.551
- You're a fucking dork.
- [laughs]

24:00.587 --> 24:02.687
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

24:02.722 --> 24:05.690
- [clears throat]
- Yeah.

24:05.725 --> 24:07.725
Okay.

24:16.569 --> 24:18.269
What is that?

24:18.304 --> 24:20.171
[whispers] This one's
my favorite.

24:29.382 --> 24:31.215
That's my favorite, too.

24:35.522 --> 24:37.188
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

24:37.223 --> 24:39.590
Okay.

24:39.626 --> 24:42.160
[whistles]
Emily Greenstreet,

24:42.195 --> 24:44.629
living the loft life, huh?

24:44.664 --> 24:46.698
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

24:46.733 --> 24:48.166
Wine opener?

24:48.201 --> 24:50.334
One of those drawers.
One of the--

24:50.370 --> 24:52.704
Wine opener.

24:52.739 --> 24:55.640
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

24:55.675 --> 24:58.409
Hey.

24:58.445 --> 25:02.613
I wanna do a spell.

25:02.649 --> 25:04.415
Why don't we keep drinking

25:04.451 --> 25:08.553
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

25:08.588 --> 25:11.289
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

25:11.324 --> 25:15.093
Yeah. You'll like it.

25:15.128 --> 25:18.329
- Mm.
- Come on.

25:18.364 --> 25:20.164
Cheat day.

25:22.023 --> 25:23.473
The defenestration of Prague.

25:23.528 --> 25:24.627
No, you already said that.

25:24.663 --> 25:26.396
- There were two.
- Mm.

25:26.431 --> 25:28.398
Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

25:28.433 --> 25:29.832
is out the window.

25:29.868 --> 25:32.223
Like the guys in Prague.

25:34.439 --> 25:35.905
Shit.

25:35.941 --> 25:41.611
Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

25:41.646 --> 25:44.781
Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

25:44.816 --> 25:45.982
But I'll do it.

25:46.017 --> 25:48.685
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.788
Get over yourself, Ned Stark.

25:54.526 --> 25:56.326
Ned Stark.

26:07.706 --> 26:09.973
Do you even like magic?

26:10.008 --> 26:12.475
Yeah, like...

26:12.510 --> 26:16.813
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

26:16.848 --> 26:19.515
Money and food
don't explode in your face.

26:19.551 --> 26:23.286
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

26:23.321 --> 26:26.756
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

26:26.791 --> 26:29.659
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

26:29.694 --> 26:32.462
Good.

26:32.497 --> 26:34.964
Maybe you're simply done.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.968
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

26:39.004 --> 26:42.772
Why? Chance at what?

26:42.807 --> 26:46.376
Few years of happy life.

26:46.411 --> 26:48.611
[laughs]

26:48.647 --> 26:53.716
There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

26:53.752 --> 26:57.387
What surprise?

26:57.422 --> 27:01.891
Energy current
should be constant.

27:03.695 --> 27:08.564
But it's not.
Why?

27:08.600 --> 27:10.800
There is something
happening to magic.

27:10.835 --> 27:13.336
The wellspring in Fillory.

27:13.371 --> 27:16.506
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

27:16.541 --> 27:18.808
Maybe it's going to disappear.

27:18.843 --> 27:21.477
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

27:21.513 --> 27:25.615
If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be Magician,

27:25.650 --> 27:29.352
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

27:29.387 --> 27:31.087
All right.
Okay, thank you.

27:31.122 --> 27:34.357
I'll meditate on it.
I...

27:34.392 --> 27:37.460
Right now, I'm staying.

27:37.495 --> 27:41.664
Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

27:41.700 --> 27:44.133
You know what?
If it's so bad, you get out!

27:44.169 --> 27:46.936
You leave, I'll leave.

27:46.971 --> 27:50.139
I cannot leave.
Thanks for reminder.

27:50.175 --> 27:53.176
What--what,
you're trapped here?

27:53.211 --> 27:55.745
Remarkably like that.

27:55.780 --> 27:57.847
Incorporate bond.

27:57.882 --> 27:59.916
Even I cannot break.

27:59.951 --> 28:01.818
Why?

28:01.853 --> 28:05.988
What did you do?

28:06.024 --> 28:08.791
I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

28:14.199 --> 28:18.601
Okay!

28:18.636 --> 28:20.703
I make love to many students.

28:20.739 --> 28:25.141
And then I fucked the wrong one.

28:25.176 --> 28:27.577
Oops.

28:27.612 --> 28:30.580
They sent you here?
God.

28:30.615 --> 28:32.115
It was that...

28:36.121 --> 28:39.088
Or give up magic.

28:39.124 --> 28:42.091
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

29:05.850 --> 29:09.018
Tell me, if you were in charge,

29:09.053 --> 29:12.155
how would the FU Fighters
fix Fillory?

29:13.825 --> 29:16.526
It's an illusion spell.

29:16.561 --> 29:18.027
Party trick, really.
It'll only last

29:18.062 --> 29:20.963

29:20.999 --> 29:22.498
You first.

29:22.534 --> 29:25.735
Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

29:38.082 --> 29:39.582
You joined some kinda gang?

29:39.617 --> 29:41.517
Yes.

29:41.553 --> 29:42.885

30:22.327 --> 30:26.162
I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

30:26.197 --> 30:29.065
You, Charlie.

30:29.100 --> 30:31.834
That's why he's
at Brakebills South.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.169

30:33.204 --> 30:35.238
Shh.

30:35.273 --> 30:37.807
You're ruining it.

30:37.842 --> 30:42.311
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

30:42.347 --> 30:45.848

a Russian accent?

I've gotta get home.

32:58.511 --> 33:00.411
I had a good time.

You don't have to go.
We can do it again.

You said yesterday
was cheat day.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.383

You can't cheat every day.

That's not what I said.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.002
Tell me, then.
What are you saying?

It felt really good,
and it was...

33:38.351 --> 33:41.919
Probably exactly what I needed,
but I...

It was also really weird and sad

executed today.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.077
We did.
But I changed my mind.

Well, I didn't.

34:44.684 --> 34:45.949

34:45.985 --> 34:47.885
The Queen may voice her opinion,

34:47.920 --> 34:51.688
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the King.

34:51.724 --> 34:56.393

What will a Magician need
if dark days come?

37:24.202 --> 37:26.569
Answer: magic.

37:26.604 --> 37:28.004
But if it is gone,
it is gone, you say.
