00:49.640 --> 00:50.630
Ragnar!

02:30.240 --> 02:31.276
<i>Odin!</i>

03:04.000 --> 03:05.559
Ragnar!

04:40.360 --> 04:41.953
Come on.
Let's go home.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.556
Watch.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.593
What are you
two doing?

05:25.800 --> 05:28.679
I'm taking Bjorn
to the thing
tomorrow.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.553
Not yet.
He's not
old enough.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.438
He's 12 years old.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.874
Take him
next year.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.633
Next year
is soon enough.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.800
He'll need
a silk ribbon,
Lagertha.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.353
You're a handsome boy.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.674
Funny ears, though.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.993
Don't sleep
with lots of women
in Kattegat.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.956
I can do
without it
for a few days.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.799
Is that another
way of saying
you love me?

06:10.800 --> 06:11.870
Huh?

06:12.120 --> 06:13.793
I always
dream of you.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.917
Last night, I dreamt
you were feeding me
blood pudding.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.353
What does that mean?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.760
It means
you're giving me
your heart.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.830
Get your dog, boy.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.156
Frodi!
Come on, boy.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.159
What will happen
at the thing?

06:59.240 --> 07:02.438
The Earl
will deal with some
criminal offenses,

07:02.520 --> 07:04.830
and then,
we'll discuss
the summer raids.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.914
And where
will you go?

07:08.160 --> 07:09.879
The Earl decides.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.594
He owns the ships.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.597
He'll send us
to the east,

07:15.680 --> 07:17.592
as always,
to the Baltic lands,

07:18.800 --> 07:20.951
but I want to know
what's to the west.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.350
What cities
and gods
are over there.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.032
See, I'm not
satisfied

07:27.040 --> 07:28.599
with this.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.712
Odin gave his eye
to acquire knowledge,

07:39.160 --> 07:41.231
but I would give
far more.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.715
And will
Earl Haraldson
let you?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.599
Good.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.469
Like this,
nice and tight.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.439
And on three.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.710
One, two,
three.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.319
Very good, Gyda.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.072
Gyda, feed the goats.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.390
Go on!

08:22.880 --> 08:24.075
What do you want?

08:24.160 --> 08:25.833
We know
you're all
alone here.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.752
All the men are gone.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.912
If you're thirsty,
I will give you
a drink.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.395
If you're hungry,
I will feed you.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.791
Otherwise, you must go.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.159
We will eat and drink
after we've satisfied
our other needs.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.191
I don't want
to kill you,
woman.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.957
You couldn't kill me
if you tried
for 100 years.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.355
Out!

09:28.720 --> 09:29.710
Gyda!

09:39.560 --> 09:41.199
Gyda.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.150
I went
to confess my love to her,

09:47.680 --> 09:49.399
but I was set upon
by a bear

09:49.480 --> 09:52.712
and an enormous hound
who guarded her home.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.912
I killed the bear
with my spear,

09:58.360 --> 10:01.558
and I managed
to strangle the hound
with my bare hands.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.511
And that is how
I gained her hand
in marriage.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.396
Did she tell you
the same story?

10:14.080 --> 10:15.514
Just about.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.115
Are you ready to receive
your arm ring
and become a man?

10:27.640 --> 10:28.960
Yes.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.633
And what does
a man do?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.000
He fights.

10:34.440 --> 10:35.510
And?

10:36.720 --> 10:39.030
He looks after
his family.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.394
That's right.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.236
Could you
look after
our family?

10:47.440 --> 10:50.433
What do you mean?
You look after us.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.113
Say I wasn't there.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.871
I have
a big decision
to make.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.956
It may change
many things.

11:02.200 --> 11:06.114
Now, go to sleep.
You have a big day
tomorrow.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.319
Bjorn!

12:37.960 --> 12:39.838
So, here you are,
brother.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.436
Rollo.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.637
By Freyr
and all the gods,
how you've grown.

12:43.720 --> 12:44.870
Hello, Rollo.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.032
Are you here
for the thing?
You're a real man now.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.473
Come, let's get
a drink.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.717
Looking a little
pale, Bjorn.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.517
Are you ready
for a woman?

13:05.960 --> 13:10.079
There's some good-looking
women in Kattegat.
Some of them are free.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.829
Can't even grow a beard,
can you, boy?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.471
Why don't you go
lie down?

13:25.240 --> 13:28.551
So where do you think
the Earl is going
to send us this year?

13:29.400 --> 13:32.393
Those bastards
to the east
are as poor as we are.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.755
I know.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.956
That's why
we should sail west.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.392
I've heard
such tales, Rollo.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.359
Great towns
and cities
and treasures.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.911
Hoards of gold
and silver,
and a new god.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.676
I've heard
those stories, too,
but what does it mean?

13:52.280 --> 13:54.397
We can't sail
across an open ocean.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.277
I believe
there's a way
to go west.

14:02.720 --> 14:06.794
I have something
that will change
everything.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.670
What?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.277
What is that?
Now just listen.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.671
A while back,
I met someone,

14:19.600 --> 14:21.034
a wanderer.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.435
He told me
it was possible
to go west,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.280
over the open sea,

14:27.280 --> 14:28.760
using this.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.114
It's a sun board.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.356
It needs to sit
in water.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.472
Another wanderer?

14:39.640 --> 14:40.790
This time,
it's different.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.554
Now tell me, Ragnar,
this wanderer of yours,

14:43.640 --> 14:45.313
has he ever
sailed west himself?

14:45.400 --> 14:46.959
Just get some water.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.311
Now, this candle
is the sun.

15:04.160 --> 15:08.791
Every day, the sun rises
up into the sky
until noon.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.678
See how
the shadow shortens?

15:11.400 --> 15:13.915
At noon,
it is at its shortest.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.673
That only tells me
how far south
I have traveled.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.116
Didn't I just
tell you to listen?

15:20.040 --> 15:23.716
The day before sailing,
you mark a circle
around the pointer

15:23.800 --> 15:26.554
where the shadow
is at its shortest at noon.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.594
The next day at sea,

15:29.040 --> 15:31.760
you place the board
back into water
around noon

15:31.840 --> 15:33.399
and watch the shadow.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.229
If the shadow
only touches the circle...

15:37.440 --> 15:39.079
Your course
remains true?

15:39.160 --> 15:40.196
Yes.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.672
And if it passes
outside the circle,
like this...

15:44.600 --> 15:48.594
Then you have drifted,
and you must steer
further south.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.909
Yes.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.790
And what if it
never reaches
the circle?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.955
Then you are too far south,
and must steer
more to the north.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.554
That's it!

15:58.360 --> 16:01.751
Keep the noon shadow
on the circle,

16:01.840 --> 16:03.559
and your course will be true.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.199
West.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.991
But what if
there is no sun?

16:13.080 --> 16:15.276
How can the board
help you then?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.398
How could you
find your way?

16:22.240 --> 16:23.469
Using this.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.080
Follow me outside.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.318
They call it
a sunstone.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.795
You see?

16:43.760 --> 16:45.638
There is the sun.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.632
Now we go west.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.876
Come on.
Come on.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.679
Silence!

17:09.760 --> 17:11.592
Silence!

17:30.920 --> 17:36.040
Olaf Anwend,
you have pleaded guilty
to the charge of stealing.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.796
Tomorrow,
you will run
a gauntlet of stones

17:38.880 --> 17:40.917
and turf as punishment.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.880
Yes, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.390
Let it be known,
a fine is to be paid

17:47.480 --> 17:51.713
by anyone who fails
to throw something.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.878
Bring in the next accused.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.151
- There he is!
- Murderer!

18:00.760 --> 18:01.989
Burn him!

18:03.280 --> 18:06.637
Eric Trygvasson,
you are accused
of the murder

18:06.720 --> 18:09.952
of Sigvald Strut
this January.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.070
How do you plead?

18:12.160 --> 18:15.278
It wasn't murder, Lord.
I killed him in self-defense.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.033
Liar!

18:18.680 --> 18:19.830
If it wasn't murder,

18:19.920 --> 18:21.479
why did you not
declare your crime

18:21.560 --> 18:23.870
to the first person
that you met afterwards,

18:23.960 --> 18:25.997
as the law obliges?

18:26.080 --> 18:31.997
In fact, you passed
by several houses
before you reported it.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.517
I thought the relatives
of the dead man
might be living in them.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.195
The law allows you
to pass two houses,
in such circumstances,

18:43.440 --> 18:44.874
but never a third.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.952
You murdered
my brother
in cold blood!

18:47.040 --> 18:49.077
It's not true!

18:49.160 --> 18:53.200
We argued about
some disputed land.
He pulled out a knife!

18:53.280 --> 18:55.397
You wanted
that land
for yourself!

18:55.840 --> 18:58.719
You're a liar
and a coward.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.679
Who says
I'm a coward?
I'm not a coward.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.120
Silence!

19:05.720 --> 19:08.394
As the normal procedures
were not followed,

19:08.720 --> 19:11.235
this killing
cannot be atoned for

19:12.080 --> 19:14.356
by compensating
the victim's family.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.391
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.431
Carried out in secret,
unacknowledged,

19:23.080 --> 19:26.312
and likely to give rise
to a series
of revenge killings

19:26.400 --> 19:29.359
that would involve
your own family.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.071
Lord, you knew
about that land.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.390
You knew I had
a claim to it...
Enough!

19:37.400 --> 19:39.995
I ask you
to look
to the accused.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.472
If you think
that he is guilty,

19:44.440 --> 19:45.760
raise your arms.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.590
The decision
must be unanimous.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.120
Eric Trygvasson,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.836
you have been found
guilty of murder.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.079
- Yes!
- Justice!

20:20.480 --> 20:22.119
How do you wish to die?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.352
By beheading, Lord.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.434
Your wish is granted.
You shall be
executed tomorrow.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.877
After which we shall feast
and talk about
the summer raids.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.359
You have to.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.360
Why is he smiling,
Father?

21:41.680 --> 21:44.878
He wants to die well,
without fear,

21:45.640 --> 21:47.393
to atone for his sins.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.594
You must watch,
for his sake.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.079
It's his only hope
of reaching Valhalla.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.559
Feed him to your pigs!

22:24.920 --> 22:26.798
And I curse him.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.637
May he never
enter Valhalla.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.240
May he never feast
with the gods.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.960
Why did he do that?

22:40.040 --> 22:42.032
He should not
have done that.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.157
Someone told me
he wanted that
land for himself,

22:45.240 --> 22:47.038
and he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

22:47.120 --> 22:48.793
but refused to sell it.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.080
You hear that, boy?
This is how things
are done around here.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.031
Olaf,
son of Ingolf,

23:00.280 --> 23:02.237
Bjorn, son of Ragnar,

23:03.000 --> 23:07.040
may you accept this
gift of salt and earth

23:07.800 --> 23:13.034
to remind yourself
that you belong
to both the land and the sea.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.280
These arm rings
bind you in loyalty to me,
your lord, your chieftain.

23:27.240 --> 23:31.314
Any oath that you swear
on these rings
must be honored and kept.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.753
Do you understand
and swear to this?

23:33.840 --> 23:35.320
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.515
And do you freely
give your fealty to me,
your lord, your chieftain?

23:39.800 --> 23:41.314
Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.355
Good. You may put
on the arm rings.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.479
Come here.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.034
Let us feast!

24:23.200 --> 24:24.475
My Lord,

24:26.120 --> 24:27.679
we all want to feast,

24:28.400 --> 24:31.711
but we also want to know
where we will be
raiding this summer.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.478
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.320
No. Tell us.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.240
We want to know.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.559
We have a right
to know.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.075
Very well.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.112
We will raid east again,
to the eastlands
and into Russia.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.674
Every year

24:50.080 --> 24:51.799
we go to the same places!

24:55.560 --> 24:57.756
But there
is an alternative,

25:00.600 --> 25:01.829
if you choose.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.831
Yes, yes. Choice, yes.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.156
I have heard
of these rumors,
these stories.

25:12.280 --> 25:15.990
That if we travel west,
that we will somehow
reach a land

25:16.080 --> 25:17.958
that is rich and plentiful.

25:20.560 --> 25:25.316
But I tell you
that I will not risk
my ships or my reputation

25:25.760 --> 25:27.911
on such a deluded fantasy.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.595
They are my ships.
I pay for them.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.515
And they go
where I tell them to go.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.071
Now that's the end
of the matter.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.355
Let's feast!

25:58.480 --> 26:00.119
Let me see!

26:02.480 --> 26:04.073
It's a fine ring.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.998
Ragnar Lothbrok,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.835
Earl Haraldson
wants to speak
with you in private.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.273
Stay with your uncle.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.832
Ragnar Lothbrok.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.555
Sit down.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.152
Are you hungry?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.914
Yes, Lord.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.872
You want to feast
in my hall?

26:58.240 --> 27:00.800
You want to sail
in my ships?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.792
Anything else
you want from me?

27:04.200 --> 27:05.236
Lord...

27:05.320 --> 27:08.040
You keep talking
about the west.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.358
What do you know of it? Hmm?

27:11.520 --> 27:15.514
Why are you so certain
that it's a land
of great riches?

27:16.400 --> 27:17.754
I can't be sure.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.190
But I believe that...

27:20.280 --> 27:22.192
I don't care
what you believe.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.236
You insulted me
out there,

27:26.120 --> 27:28.157
and not for
the first time,

27:29.080 --> 27:32.790
but, believe me,
it will be the last.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.392
Who told you
you could go?

27:48.840 --> 27:51.435
You are a farmer.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.595
You should be content
with your lot.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.438
Farms are few
and in great demand,

28:02.080 --> 28:04.231
and there are many
people here

28:04.320 --> 28:06.789
who would like
to possess your land.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.115
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.114
I understand.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.590
Then don't ever
stick your nose
in my face again.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.474
I don't trust him.
Watch him.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.956
Where are we
going now? I'm so tired.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.474
To talk
to the gods.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.874
It's what we do.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.310
Why don't you come in?
I'm waiting.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.155
Sit.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.434
What do you want?

29:18.240 --> 29:20.880
I want to know
what the gods
have in store.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.118
For you,
or for the boy?

29:26.360 --> 29:28.920
I'm more interested
in myself.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.195
The gods desire you
to have a great future.
I see that.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.111
But they can withdraw
their goodwill at any time.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.509
To have
this great future,

29:43.200 --> 29:44.953
must I challenge the law?

29:45.320 --> 29:50.270
You must convince
the gods to alter the runes

29:51.720 --> 29:53.996
so they work in your favor.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.916
But the laws of men

29:57.360 --> 30:01.877
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.394
So I should take
the laws of men

30:08.240 --> 30:09.833
into my own hands?

30:13.960 --> 30:15.440
Answer me.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.951
You already
have your answer.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.630
No, I don't.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.038
Well,
then go and ask
the gods yourself.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.112
What are you afraid of?

30:34.760 --> 30:36.035
Wait outside.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.520
All right.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.872
You haven't helped me
at all, ancient one.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.955
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.517
Where are they?

31:08.600 --> 31:09.920
Where are my sons?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.400
You said you'd found them.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.197
We have someone
special to visit.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.277
His name is Floki.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.510
"Floki"?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.957
Like Loki, the god?

32:14.720 --> 32:17.599
Yes, only different.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.112
How is he different?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.759
He's not a god.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.280
Why didn't he come
to the thing?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.680
Because...

32:28.160 --> 32:29.674
Because he's shy.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.352
Floki, this is
my son, Bjorn.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.596
Hello. How are you?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.316
Well. Thank you, sir.

32:46.680 --> 32:47.875
Let me see.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.871
You have
your father's eyes

32:54.480 --> 32:56.073
unfortunately.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.793
Why unfortunately?

32:59.160 --> 33:01.277
It means
he will be like you,

33:01.360 --> 33:04.114
and therefore
he will want to do
better than you,

33:04.200 --> 33:06.192
and you will
hate him for it.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.079
How can you tell that
by just looking
at my face?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.152
It's the same
with trees.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.072
I can tell
which trees will make

33:16.160 --> 33:18.595
the best planks
just by looking at them.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.233
I can look
inside the tree.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.432
Floki is a boat-builder.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.473
Among other things.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.434
This is one.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.439
Inside this tree
are two almost
perfect planks.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.791
They will bend,
then curve,

34:06.880 --> 34:09.520
like a woman's body
from the thighs
to the back.

34:09.600 --> 34:13.310
When I split this tree,
I will find them.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.272
You can see that?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.670
Do you think
I'm joking?

34:32.639 --> 34:37.237
I joke
about many things,
son of Ragnar,

34:37.320 --> 34:39.710
but never about
ship-building.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.991
Do you imagine
ships are just
dead things?

34:44.719 --> 34:47.838
So, what about
our boat?

34:52.120 --> 34:54.429
It will be lighter
and carry a bigger sail.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.840
The construction
is different.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.877
It's built
with a strong
central plank.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.599
The two strakes
above it are nailed

34:59.680 --> 35:00.909
directly onto
the knees of the frame.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.912
But the ones
below... Look!

35:03.000 --> 35:05.754
Are cleated and
lashed onto the frames,
not nailed,

35:05.840 --> 35:07.911
so they can move
in relation to each other.

35:08.040 --> 35:11.078
This means the boat
won't butt against
the waves like a goat,

35:11.160 --> 35:13.197
but move over them
like a ripple.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.589
The hull is deeper.
How will my men
set their oars?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.592
I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,

35:18.720 --> 35:21.030
and the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.998
And you think
it could handle
long sea voyages?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.720
That's why
I'm building it.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.032
But will it be
strong enough?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.951
We won't know
that until we try.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.312
When will it be ready?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.878
As to that...

35:47.480 --> 35:48.470
What?

35:49.760 --> 35:51.353
We're out of money.

35:52.560 --> 35:55.837
We have to pay for the sail
and then the anchor.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.914
I know what those blacksmiths
are like, greedy bastards.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.840
For the anchor.

36:02.880 --> 36:05.839
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.354
Don't worry.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.593
We'll soon be
as rich as dwarves!

36:19.960 --> 36:21.838
I missed you.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.840
Did anything happen
while we were away?

36:35.440 --> 36:36.669
No.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.789
Did you miss me?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.875
I ached
with love longing.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.075
My belly was empty
of laughter.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.431
Is that
what you want? Hmm?

37:04.320 --> 37:06.232
You want me
to make you laugh?

37:08.040 --> 37:10.236
I don't want
to laugh now.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.356
I want to ride you,

37:16.800 --> 37:17.995
like a bull.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.476
Like a wild bull.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.038
Hello, young Bjorn.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.914
Hello, Rollo.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.633
Where are your parents?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.311
They are having sex.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.520
Well...

38:05.000 --> 38:07.196
I guess
we'll have to wait.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.118
So, Gyda,

38:23.920 --> 38:26.480
is your mother
teaching you how
to use a shield?

38:26.560 --> 38:28.916
Yes, I know
how to use a shield.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.156
Your mother
was a famous
shield-maiden.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.470
"Was"?

38:33.560 --> 38:35.233
Is a famous shield-maiden.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.277
We fought in
the same shield wall

38:38.000 --> 38:39.992
against the eastlanders.

38:43.240 --> 38:44.799
She fought like a valkyrie.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.479
Come on,
children, to bed.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.835
Let's leave the men.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.957
But I'm a man.
I have a ring.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.198
Let him stay awhile.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.634
To bed!

39:01.480 --> 39:02.880
Say good night.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.519
Good night,
my children.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.319
- Good night.
- Good night.

39:06.400 --> 39:07.675
Good night.
Good night.

39:07.760 --> 39:08.989
Hey!

39:18.600 --> 39:20.592
Good night, Father.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.393
Tell me your news.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.440
What about the boat?

39:27.000 --> 39:28.719
It's nearly ready.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.031
Do you trust Floki?

39:35.960 --> 39:37.633
Isn't he a great joker?

39:38.520 --> 39:42.753
He's a great boat builder.
I trust him to do that.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.714
I won't go
under your command.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.195
I won't go
unless we're all equal.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.952
We are brothers.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.270
You and I will
always be equal.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.638
Then we must find a crew.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.318
Not many men
will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.993
Many will be afraid.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.358
Some may even go
to him and betray us.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.159
I must go piss.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.637
Yesterday, I was
with a girl
from the town.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.790
Thank you.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.438
A good-looking
girl, too.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.555
But when
she shouted out
in pleasure,

41:14.400 --> 41:16.198
I didn't see
her face.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.398
I saw yours.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.234
Lagertha...

41:25.920 --> 41:27.718
Don't talk like that.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.115
Why not?

41:31.560 --> 41:33.517
I think about you
all the time.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.519
That's too bad.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.392
Don't insult me,
shield-maiden.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.155
No.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.550
I would never
insult you.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.109
You're too great
a warrior,

41:50.680 --> 41:53.673
but perhaps
not so great a man.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.074
I saw something.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.554
What did you see?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.677
A sign.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.794
It made me
certain we're doing
the right thing.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.679
Good night, brother.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.679
It's...
No need to say.

43:20.760 --> 43:23.832
I see it in your eyes.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.550
Beautiful.

43:31.400 --> 43:34.154
It's only beautiful
if it works.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.320
Set the sail.

43:54.960 --> 43:57.316
Floki! The sail!

43:58.040 --> 43:59.315
She'll sink.

43:59.400 --> 44:00.800
No, she bloody won't.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.714
I shouldn't have
pretended to build
such a boat.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.111
It's beyond
my humble capabilities.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.240
I'll set the sail.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.400
I'm sorry, Ragnar.

44:11.680 --> 44:13.956
I've wasted
all your money.
It was all a joke.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.713
Shut up, man.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.790
Ha!

44:45.280 --> 44:47.431
Now it runs
on its cool keel.

44:47.600 --> 44:48.954
It's beautiful.

44:49.600 --> 44:53.480
Why didn't you
believe me?
I told you I could do it!

44:58.080 --> 45:01.790
Now it's all up to you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.
