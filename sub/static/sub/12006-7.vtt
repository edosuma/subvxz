<i>John: Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:01.579 --> 00:03.835
Wow, I can't believe you made all of these.

00:03.997 --> 00:05.931
Do you know your sister is, like, a genius?

00:06.704 --> 00:08.119
_

00:08.122 --> 00:09.802
I need to ask for an
advance on my billings.

00:09.836 --> 00:11.070
- $50,000.
- Okay.

00:11.184 --> 00:13.886
Under one condition: You
work for me exclusively.

00:13.920 --> 00:14.887
Fine.

00:15.647 --> 00:17.786
_

00:19.060 --> 00:21.587
_

00:21.627 --> 00:22.060
Wow.

00:23.096 --> 00:24.096
I sold a book idea.

00:24.130 --> 00:25.197
And I wanna hear all about it.

00:25.331 --> 00:27.199
Kathryn, are you out of your mind?

00:27.233 --> 00:29.067
You are talking about intimate details

00:29.102 --> 00:31.036
of our friends' lives.

00:31.070 --> 00:33.005
- My mom... she didn't show up for work.
- Is everything okay?

00:33.099 --> 00:36.068
I was just so sick of looking at that wall.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.336
Her mom is mentally ill.

00:37.490 --> 00:39.391
Stop! If you wanna be a friend to me,

00:39.425 --> 00:41.593
promise you'll leave this alone.

00:41.627 --> 00:43.395
This guy I was gonna see
tonight just bailed on me.

00:43.429 --> 00:44.529
You can join me if you want.

00:46.432 --> 00:47.599
<i>Toby: Does someone wanna
tell me what's going on here?</i>

00:47.700 --> 00:50.335
I kissed your father.

00:50.369 --> 00:51.503
It was a stupid, drunken kiss.

00:51.537 --> 00:52.637
I want you out of here!

00:57.011 --> 00:59.578
<i>Woman on TV: Welcome back on
this beautiful day in Kansas City.</i>

00:59.612 --> 01:01.446
<i>Good morning, everybody.
Coming up, a local chef</i>

01:01.481 --> 01:03.348
<i>stops by to show us what to...</i>

01:04.584 --> 01:07.219
<i>- (Softly groans)
- Rise and shine.</i>

01:07.253 --> 01:09.221
(Groaning) Oh, man,

01:09.255 --> 01:11.223
I am buying you a new couch.

01:11.257 --> 01:12.390
<i>- (TV turns off)
- Oh.</i>

01:12.425 --> 01:14.459
Or you could just go
home and apologize to mom

01:14.494 --> 01:16.294
for making out with my mother-in-law.

01:16.329 --> 01:19.297
I told you last night Jennice kissed me.

01:19.332 --> 01:20.532
Just so you know, it's not gonna make

01:20.566 --> 01:23.401
your future grandkids' birthday
parties any less awkward.

01:23.436 --> 01:25.237
All right, I get it. I get it, all right?

01:25.271 --> 01:27.439
You know, I shouldn't have had her
over when your mom was outta town.

01:27.473 --> 01:29.407
Okay, I made a mistake.

01:29.442 --> 01:30.575
Yeah, you did.

01:30.610 --> 01:32.244
I don't even know what
I'm gonna tell Nikki.

01:32.278 --> 01:34.179
Well, there's nothing to tell.

01:34.213 --> 01:35.514
It didn't mean anything.

01:35.548 --> 01:37.516
It was a moment, and then it was gone.

01:37.550 --> 01:39.417
And that's, you know...

01:39.452 --> 01:40.585
try telling your mother that.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.388
Who, by the way, is
completely overreacting.

01:43.422 --> 01:45.390
So, uh...

01:45.424 --> 01:47.225
you just gonna live here forever?

01:47.260 --> 01:48.560
Nope.

01:48.594 --> 01:50.595
I think till your mother
comes to her senses

01:50.630 --> 01:52.597
and accepts my apology.

01:52.632 --> 01:54.299
(Groans loudly)

01:54.333 --> 01:55.500
Shouldn't be too long.

01:55.535 --> 01:59.171
It's just, you know,
this place isn't that big.

01:59.205 --> 02:02.307
And I kinda need my living room to...

02:02.341 --> 02:04.142
live in.

02:04.177 --> 02:06.311
Come on, it's gonna be fun.

02:06.345 --> 02:08.513
<i>Oh-ho, when I was in the minors,</i>

02:08.548 --> 02:11.349
they used to cram us
in, four guys to a room.

02:11.384 --> 02:13.118
And you know what?

02:13.152 --> 02:15.320
Those were some of the
best times of my life.

02:15.354 --> 02:16.555
(Chuckles)

02:16.589 --> 02:17.589
You know what we're gonna do?

02:17.623 --> 02:19.491
We're gonna start this day

02:19.525 --> 02:22.594
the way me and boys used
to back in the day...

02:22.628 --> 02:24.262
with a doubleheader.

02:24.297 --> 02:26.531
Four eggs, four pieces of toast,

02:26.566 --> 02:27.566
<i>hash browns.</i>

02:27.600 --> 02:29.501
You put it all on a big bed of bacon.

02:29.535 --> 02:31.503
And I'm talking real bacon, my friend.

02:31.537 --> 02:34.573
Not that turkey crap your
mom has in the kitchen.

02:34.607 --> 02:36.575
You got a frying pan around here somewhere?

02:42.315 --> 02:43.415
- Hi.
- Morning, honey.

02:43.449 --> 02:45.250
- You hungry?
- Not really.

02:45.284 --> 02:46.585
But it looks like you're covered in case

02:46.619 --> 02:48.587
<i>the rest of the neighborhood stops by.</i>

02:48.621 --> 02:50.422
I couldn't sleep last night. (Sighs)

02:50.456 --> 02:54.159
Well, notice anything different about me?

02:54.193 --> 02:56.261
- You got your hand back.
- Mm-hmm.

02:56.295 --> 02:58.363
Yep. And check out my cool scar.

02:58.397 --> 03:01.333
I'm thinking of telling
people I had stigmata.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.401
You know, you still have to rest it.

03:03.436 --> 03:05.170
I will. Hey, where's dad?

03:05.204 --> 03:06.338
He's gonna wanna see this.
You know how he's always

03:06.372 --> 03:08.540
- bragging about that scar on his knee.
- I...

03:08.574 --> 03:12.277
You know, I think your dad
had an early tee time today.

03:12.311 --> 03:14.412
All right, I guess I'll text him a picture.

03:14.447 --> 03:16.114
<i>(Door closes)</i>

03:16.148 --> 03:17.115
<i>Toby: Hey.</i>

03:17.149 --> 03:18.383
Morning, honey.

03:18.417 --> 03:19.551
Here to pick up some clothes.

03:19.585 --> 03:21.419
Didn't you move all your stuff already?

03:21.454 --> 03:24.189
Not for me.

03:24.223 --> 03:25.323
I'll take care of it.

03:28.194 --> 03:29.427
Okay, what's going on?

03:29.462 --> 03:31.229
I thought you knew.

03:32.298 --> 03:34.366
Last night mom and dad had a big fight.

03:37.570 --> 03:39.237
She kicked him out.

05:22.208 --> 05:25.376
I'm trying to make it seem like
a job in audiological sciences

05:25.377 --> 05:28.146
is not just for geeks. But, uh,

05:28.180 --> 05:29.481
between you and me,

05:29.515 --> 05:31.549
it is totally just for geeks.

05:31.584 --> 05:33.451
(Chuckles)

05:36.589 --> 05:37.555
Ahem.

05:40.526 --> 05:42.427
Don't worry about it.

05:42.461 --> 05:45.463
Getting a woman's number
through her ex-husband...

05:47.299 --> 05:48.600
It's probably not the smoothest of moves.

05:48.601 --> 05:51.282
_

05:53.165 --> 05:57.851
_

05:57.863 --> 05:59.444
Don't need to explain it.

05:59.478 --> 06:01.246
I get it.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.247
It's okay.

06:05.317 --> 06:07.285
It's really good to see you again.

06:08.487 --> 06:09.554
See you later.

06:16.529 --> 06:18.163
<i>Daphne: Hey, Sharee, wait up.</i>

06:20.366 --> 06:22.534
Hey, is everything okay?

06:22.568 --> 06:24.302
You weren't in school last week.

06:24.336 --> 06:25.470
Yeah, because I was being interviewed

06:25.504 --> 06:27.138
by child protective services.

06:27.173 --> 06:29.374
They came to the house.
Oh, and my mom thinks

06:29.408 --> 06:32.143
our neighbor was the one who
called, but I know it was you.

06:32.178 --> 06:33.244
I was worried.

06:33.279 --> 06:35.213
You said yourself she's sick.

06:35.247 --> 06:37.182
I also said I could handle it.

06:37.216 --> 06:38.550
You're lucky they came when
she was having a good day.

06:38.644 --> 06:40.578
Wait, that's it? They're
not gonna do anything?

06:40.613 --> 06:43.448
Actually, yeah. They're
gonna do surprise visits.

06:43.482 --> 06:45.617
So I have that to look forward to.

06:45.651 --> 06:47.585
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.587
I know. And I'm sorry.

06:49.622 --> 06:51.256
But I didn't know what else to do.

06:51.290 --> 06:52.624
I was just trying to be a good friend.

06:52.658 --> 06:55.293
Ugh. Right. There's not
enough drama in your own life,

06:55.361 --> 06:56.361
so you had to meddle in mine.

06:56.395 --> 06:58.429
No, that's not it at all.

06:58.464 --> 07:00.398
Look...

07:00.432 --> 07:02.133
my mom's a recovering alcoholic,

07:02.167 --> 07:03.434
so I know what it's like.

07:03.469 --> 07:07.171
You're scared that if anybody
finds out what's going on,

07:07.206 --> 07:08.439
you might never get her back,

07:08.474 --> 07:11.175
so you keep lying to yourself,
hoping it'll get better.

07:11.644 --> 07:13.511
But it doesn't.

07:13.546 --> 07:16.347
So far, the only person
who's lied to me is you.

07:16.382 --> 07:18.249
So why don't you mind your own business?

07:20.000 --> 07:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

07:28.294 --> 07:29.394
What do you think of the designs?

07:29.428 --> 07:31.529
- Very impressive.
- Thanks.

07:31.564 --> 07:33.631
They're for a meeting
Wes is hosting tomorrow

07:33.666 --> 07:35.633
for "The friends of East Riverside."

07:35.668 --> 07:37.535
He wants to get some
buy-in from the community

07:37.570 --> 07:39.203
before we break ground on the project.

07:39.238 --> 07:41.606
Oh, I had no idea that
it was going to be so big.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.608
I mean, a whole city block?

07:43.642 --> 07:45.443
That's Wes. His motto...

07:45.477 --> 07:47.579
"Think big, then think bigger."

07:47.643 --> 07:49.510
And what about those businesses

07:49.545 --> 07:50.678
in the building you're tearing down?

07:50.713 --> 07:52.280
I mean, some of them have been there

07:52.314 --> 07:53.414
since before you were born.

07:53.449 --> 07:56.250
Wes will take care of them.

07:56.285 --> 07:58.286
Trust me, Mario can buy three pizza places

07:58.320 --> 08:00.388
and Hector never has to cut hair again.

08:00.422 --> 08:02.390
Oh, well. Good for Hector and Mario.

08:02.424 --> 08:03.558
No no no, not just them.

08:03.592 --> 08:06.327
This is gonna be good for
the whole neighborhood.

08:06.362 --> 08:07.395
I'll see you later.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.605
_

08:11.608 --> 08:14.335
Yeah, I am totally billing my dad

08:14.370 --> 08:17.572
for whatever amount of therapy it
takes to erase that image from my brain.

08:17.573 --> 08:19.486
_

08:19.508 --> 08:20.642
She doesn't know yet.

08:20.676 --> 08:24.612
I mean this in the nicest way possible.

08:24.647 --> 08:26.180
She would totally freak out.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.483
I'm pretty sure it's gonna blow over.

08:28.517 --> 08:32.587
My mom's not gonna throw
away 20 years of marriage

08:32.621 --> 08:34.355
because of one kiss, right?

08:36.900 --> 08:39.129
_

08:41.397 --> 08:43.563
Now tell me what you really think.

08:46.572 --> 08:52.019
_

08:52.820 --> 08:56.843
_

08:57.312 --> 08:58.579
You never told me that.

08:59.580 --> 09:03.011
_

09:03.012 --> 09:07.335
_

09:14.196 --> 09:15.329
Yo, Sharee.

09:15.364 --> 09:16.330
Is that your mom?

09:26.475 --> 09:27.442
Mom, what are you doing here?

09:27.476 --> 09:29.377
You know damn well why I'm here.

09:29.411 --> 09:31.579
- No, I don't.
- You didn't make your bed this morning!

09:35.217 --> 09:37.218
I'm sorry. Okay, I forgot.

09:37.252 --> 09:39.654
Oh, that's your excuse?
You are such a slob.

09:39.688 --> 09:41.322
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

09:41.356 --> 09:42.457
Mom, please.

09:42.491 --> 09:44.192
- Not here.
- Oh, why?

09:44.226 --> 09:46.194
Because of your friends?
You don't want them knowing

09:46.228 --> 09:47.662
- what a pig you are!
- Okay, I'll clean up tonight.

09:47.696 --> 09:50.398
- I promise.
- No, you're gonna do it right now.

09:50.432 --> 09:52.300
I can't just leave school.

09:52.334 --> 09:54.202
What if those guys from
the state come back?

09:55.404 --> 09:57.205
You think I'm gonna let
them take you away from me

09:57.239 --> 09:58.506
'cause our house is a mess?

09:58.540 --> 10:00.408
Get in the car now!

10:00.442 --> 10:01.676
Okay!

10:01.710 --> 10:03.644
Let me get my bag.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.322
- I don't think you should go.
- Trust me.

10:14.356 --> 10:16.591
When she's acting like this,
the best thing to do is go along.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.559
Sharee, she needs help.

10:18.594 --> 10:19.694
And so do you.

10:23.265 --> 10:24.298
I know.

10:29.471 --> 10:30.538
<i>(Car starts)</i>

10:38.115 --> 10:39.949
<i>I hope you're as excited about
what you've seen here today as I am.</i>

10:40.083 --> 10:41.217
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

10:41.251 --> 10:42.885
<i>a building is just a building.</i>

10:42.919 --> 10:44.086
We'll do our best with
the bricks and mortar,

10:44.121 --> 10:46.222
but it's you people that
need to bring the magic,

10:46.386 --> 10:48.254
<i>that turns a development like this</i>

10:48.288 --> 10:50.222
<i>into a real community.</i>

10:50.257 --> 10:51.891
<i>And I truly believe that.</i>

10:51.925 --> 10:53.325
<i>Now before I take any questions,</i>

10:53.360 --> 10:55.928
<i>I wanted to introduce to you
someone special from my team.</i>

10:55.962 --> 10:58.898
She actually brought the property
to my attention in the first place.

10:58.932 --> 11:00.900
Without her, I'd probably be talking to

11:00.934 --> 11:02.101
"The friends of Prairie Heights" right now.

11:02.135 --> 11:03.202
(All chuckle)

11:03.236 --> 11:06.205
Give her a hand. East Riverside's own...

11:06.239 --> 11:07.306
Regina Vasquez.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.241
(Applause)

11:17.918 --> 11:19.051
Hey, Dr. Jackson.

11:19.085 --> 11:20.085
Can I talk to you for a second?

11:20.120 --> 11:21.887
I need some advice.

11:21.922 --> 11:23.989
Hmm, let's see.

11:24.024 --> 11:25.891
Jorge's got those eyes,

11:25.926 --> 11:27.960
but Campbell's got that smile.

11:27.994 --> 11:30.196
- Excuse me?
- Every time I turn around

11:30.230 --> 11:32.965
you're flirting with one
of the guys on my staff.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.300
You're here to serve your sentence.

11:34.334 --> 11:36.135
Instead, you treat this clinic like

11:36.169 --> 11:38.103
it's the set of "the dating game."

11:38.138 --> 11:39.939
Okay...

11:39.973 --> 11:41.941
I deserve that. (Exhales)

11:41.975 --> 11:43.108
I have this friend,

11:43.143 --> 11:45.110
and her mom has some mental problems.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.947
I barely have enough
time for my own patients.

11:47.981 --> 11:49.281
- Call the county.
- I already did.

11:49.316 --> 11:50.883
Please.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.318
She has nowhere else to go.

11:52.352 --> 11:54.253
(Exhales)

11:54.287 --> 11:55.988
(Sighs)

11:58.058 --> 11:59.258
(Sighs)

11:59.292 --> 12:01.293
So, with the widening of Higgins Street

12:01.328 --> 12:02.862
on the south side of the property,

12:02.896 --> 12:04.830
we expect traffic impact to be minimal.

12:04.865 --> 12:06.065
<i>Are there any other questions?</i>

12:06.099 --> 12:07.166
Yes, ma'am.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.300
Have you thought about what your project

12:08.335 --> 12:11.170
will do to East Riverside in the long run?

12:11.204 --> 12:12.972
<i>Well, I'm glad you asked that.</i>

12:13.006 --> 12:15.140
I expect property tax to bring
upwards of two million dollars

12:15.175 --> 12:16.942
into the city every year.

12:17.010 --> 12:18.010
<i>Not to mention sales tax,</i>

12:18.044 --> 12:19.178
dozens of new jobs.

12:19.212 --> 12:22.214
But what about the families that
have lived there for generations?

12:22.249 --> 12:25.851
Well, you know what they say:
All boats rise with the tide.

12:25.886 --> 12:27.152
<i>If they can afford to.</i>

12:27.187 --> 12:29.321
What happens when your project

12:29.356 --> 12:31.223
brings people with money
to the neighborhood,

12:31.258 --> 12:33.859
and landlords double our rent

12:33.894 --> 12:35.194
just because they can?

12:35.228 --> 12:36.195
(Clears throat)

12:36.229 --> 12:39.098
<i>That tax revenue I was talking
about... that's going back</i>

12:39.132 --> 12:41.100
into your parks and into your schools.

12:41.134 --> 12:42.134
<i>It's gonna make your neighborhood safer</i>

12:42.168 --> 12:43.969
for your kids and your grandkids.

12:44.004 --> 12:46.939
I mean, that's the real
future for East Riverside.

12:46.973 --> 12:48.274
<i>That's all the time I have for questions.</i>

12:48.308 --> 12:50.042
Thank you.

12:51.278 --> 12:54.880
- (Murmuring)
- (Whispering in Spanish)

13:03.023 --> 13:05.754
- When'd the tornado hit?
- This is all dad.

13:05.821 --> 13:06.692
He's like an animal.

13:06.693 --> 13:09.128
I have no idea how mom kept the
house together all these years.

13:09.382 --> 13:12.084
- Where is he?
- Uh, he's at the grocery store.

13:12.118 --> 13:13.085
Why?

13:13.119 --> 13:14.186
(Scoffs)

13:14.220 --> 13:15.454
Well, now that my hand's working again,

13:15.488 --> 13:17.422
I thought I'd slap some sense into him.

13:17.457 --> 13:19.324
You don't think I've tried?

13:19.359 --> 13:22.327
He thinks mom should be apologizing to him

13:22.362 --> 13:23.495
for kicking him out.

13:23.530 --> 13:26.365
This is so depressing. Are
any guys faithful anymore?

13:26.399 --> 13:28.167
Me.

13:28.201 --> 13:29.501
I'm like a monk.

13:29.636 --> 13:31.536
Do you think they're
gonna get through this?

13:31.571 --> 13:33.305
Of course.

13:33.339 --> 13:35.207
(Exhales)

13:35.241 --> 13:37.409
I was thinking about how I spent the summer

13:37.443 --> 13:38.577
living with Regina and Angelo,

13:38.611 --> 13:41.246
and it was great because...

13:41.281 --> 13:43.515
I always thought John
and Kathryn would be there

13:43.549 --> 13:45.284
to come home to, you know?

13:45.318 --> 13:47.252
Yeah.

13:47.287 --> 13:48.654
One of the reasons marrying
Nikki wasn't so scary

13:48.688 --> 13:50.622
was 'cause I was like,

13:50.657 --> 13:52.457
"mom and dad have made it so long,

13:52.492 --> 13:54.426
how hard can it be?"

13:56.362 --> 13:58.497
All those stupid Kennish family traditions

13:58.531 --> 14:00.432
that I pretend to hate...

14:00.466 --> 14:02.267
what if we never get to do those again?

14:05.204 --> 14:09.207
We've gotta get them talking, and remind them
of everything that they might be giving up.

14:09.242 --> 14:10.609
You're right.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.511
First we gotta get them
in the same room together.

14:16.215 --> 14:18.517
<i>Regina: I think that went well.</i>

14:18.551 --> 14:20.285
I swear there's somebody whining

14:20.320 --> 14:21.453
about gentrification every meeting.

14:21.487 --> 14:24.456
God forbid East Riverside has
one less check-cashing store

14:24.490 --> 14:26.191
or bail bondsman.

14:26.225 --> 14:27.192
What are you doing?

14:27.226 --> 14:29.161
Looking through the sign-in sheet.

14:29.195 --> 14:30.329
That lady came in late, right?

14:30.363 --> 14:31.596
Uh, what does it matter?

14:31.631 --> 14:34.232
Oh, here we are. "Adrianna Vasquez."

14:34.267 --> 14:35.434
Any relation?

14:38.371 --> 14:39.438
She's my mom.

14:39.472 --> 14:41.406
You're kidding me, right?

14:41.441 --> 14:43.175
Unfortunately, I'm not.

14:43.209 --> 14:44.543
(Exhales)

14:44.577 --> 14:46.345
You knew she was against the project,

14:46.379 --> 14:48.280
and you let her come to
the meeting? Are you crazy?

14:48.314 --> 14:49.514
No. I swear.

14:49.549 --> 14:50.615
That was a surprise to me too.

14:50.650 --> 14:52.184
And I will be talking to her.

14:52.218 --> 14:53.251
Yeah, well, you better.

14:53.286 --> 14:55.287
Keep it in perspective...
it was just one meeting.

14:55.321 --> 14:56.455
I don't think you get it.

14:56.489 --> 14:59.257
This kinda stuff spreads like a virus.

14:59.292 --> 15:00.492
You need to get her under control.

15:01.594 --> 15:02.561
Now.

15:08.501 --> 15:11.203
From what I've read, I
think she might be bipolar.

15:11.237 --> 15:13.438
If her mood swings come
and go that quickly,

15:13.473 --> 15:16.308
it could be borderline
personality disorder.

15:16.342 --> 15:18.143
Is there any treatment for that?

15:18.177 --> 15:21.480
Therapy, maybe medication
to control the depression.

15:21.514 --> 15:23.615
But she's going to need a psych assessment.

15:23.649 --> 15:26.184
That's the problem. I
don't think we'll be able

15:26.219 --> 15:27.519
to get her to see a psychiatrist.

15:27.553 --> 15:29.388
Hmm.

15:29.422 --> 15:31.423
Maybe she'd be more
comfortable coming here.

15:31.457 --> 15:35.193
I have a colleague who's
a clinical psychologist.

15:35.228 --> 15:37.396
I could ask him to come in
and meet with her after-hours.

15:37.430 --> 15:38.397
Really?

15:38.431 --> 15:40.365
That would be incredible.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.534
You'd have to get her here
tomorrow night around closing.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.403
You think you can talk her into that?

15:46.205 --> 15:48.173
I'll find a way.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.758
Hey.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.161
Earth to Kathryn Kennish.

16:03.195 --> 16:04.963
Oh.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.765
I'm sorry. I was on a roll.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.932
You don't have to apologize.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.834
I'm just glad you're finally writing a book

16:09.869 --> 16:11.736
that's not about me.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.204
I finished two chapters this morning.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.007
It's amazing how productive I can be

16:16.042 --> 16:20.745
when I don't have to worry about
whether John Kennish has clean underwear.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.118
(Sighs) I'm sorry.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.822
I know how confusing this whole
thing with your dad and I must be.

16:30.856 --> 16:33.992
Hey, sister, you do not have
to explain anything to me.

16:34.026 --> 16:36.127
I totally get it.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.128
Guys suck.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.897
Yep.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.198
Sometimes they do.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.833
(Clicks tongue)

16:41.867 --> 16:42.834
You know what we need?

16:42.868 --> 16:43.935
Hmm?

16:43.969 --> 16:45.203
We need a girls' night out.

16:45.237 --> 16:47.005
Tonight, what do you say?

16:47.039 --> 16:48.840
Oh, we could see if
Regina and Daphne are busy,

16:48.874 --> 16:49.974
and Renzo...

16:50.009 --> 16:51.976
I was thinking it could
just be the two of us.

16:52.011 --> 16:56.915
- You know? Old school.
- That sounds fun.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.717
Should I make an appointment at the spa?

16:58.751 --> 17:00.885
Oh, I don't wanna interrupt
your storytelling magic.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.887
I will handle all the details.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.189
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.190
Wow.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.999
This is so cool.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.769
How do you not eavesdrop all the time?

17:17.803 --> 17:20.003
It's like having a super power.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.209
What's that?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.176
Oh, no. That's nothing.

Okay, now before you freak
out and think that I'm gonna

17:36.055 --> 17:38.790
stab you in the shower or something,

17:38.824 --> 17:42.026
it's henna. It comes right off.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.196

floor was doing them.

idea what we'll be eating,

but I'm sure it'll be delicious.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.753
(Chuckles) I, actually...

18:41.787 --> 18:44.989
I have to get to class,
but I'll see you both later.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.825

20:06.138 --> 20:07.972
<i>(School bell rings)</i>

20:13.012 --> 20:15.079
I already told you she's
never gonna see a doctor.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.215
I know, but I thought of that.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.150
We give out free flu shots at the clinic,

20:19.184 --> 20:21.019
so what if you tell her you're
worried about getting sick

20:21.053 --> 20:22.820
and ask her to bring you in?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.889
What happens when she finds
out why she's really there?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.224
The psychologist will know what to do,

20:26.258 --> 20:28.026
but at least we'll get her diagnosed.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.193
That's the first step.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.130
(Sighs)

20:32.164 --> 20:33.264
Okay.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.134
Let's do it.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.044
You got everything?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.813
Or you need some help
carrying in your soap box?

20:48.847 --> 20:52.150
I should have talked to you
before coming to that meeting.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.052
Yeah, you should have.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.187
What were you thinking?

20:56.221 --> 20:58.189
I was thinking about our neighborhood.

20:58.223 --> 20:59.223
Really?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.759
You haven't lived there in two years.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.761
And in case your memory's a little foggy,

21:03.796 --> 21:05.763
East Riverside was never
that great to begin with.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.199
We still have friends there and family.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.801
I'm looking out for them.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.003
And what exactly am I doing?

21:12.037 --> 21:14.172
(Sighs)

21:14.206 --> 21:16.074
You're looking out for your business.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.076
Okay.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.177
Fine.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.244
But I'm also trying to make

21:20.279 --> 21:22.080
east riverside a better place to live.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.114
What is wrong with that?

21:23.148 --> 21:25.783
I came to that meeting

21:25.818 --> 21:27.151
to listen with an open mind.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.087
I figured that maybe I was wrong.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.156
And then I saw that developer guy

21:32.191 --> 21:35.793
trot you out like his prized bull.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.161
(Sighs deeply) Is that what this is about?

21:37.196 --> 21:39.197
He needs a latina on his side.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.799
He's using you for the color of your skin.

21:41.834 --> 21:42.934
That is ridiculous.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.004
Wes hired me for my design ability

21:46.038 --> 21:48.806
before he even heard of East Riverside.

21:48.841 --> 21:52.243
I can't believe you. I am finally about
to get something good going for myself.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.811
Why do you have to take me down?

21:53.846 --> 21:54.846
That's not what I'm doing.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.848
Ah...

21:58.183 --> 21:59.150
I need this.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.753
And I expect you to get on board.

22:01.787 --> 22:02.954
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

22:11.864 --> 22:14.198
Sharee just texted me.
They're on their way in.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.200
Dr. Edwards is running a little late.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.235
Will they be able to wait?

22:17.269 --> 22:19.137
I don't know.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.139
Sharee's mom thinks
they're here for a flu shot.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.808
She doesn't know she's
meeting a psychologist?

22:24.943 --> 22:26.044
We didn't think she'd come.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.782
Oh, there she is.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.984
That was nice of you to set this up.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.920
I can't have my girl getting sick.

22:35.954 --> 22:38.823
Ms. Gifford, Sharee, this is Dr. Jackson.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.024
Hi, there.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.092
Hi.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.094
Well, let's get my baby this flu shot.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.065
Um, Ms. Gifford,

22:47.099 --> 22:48.933
<i>why don't you step into my office?</i>

22:48.967 --> 22:50.902
There's a few forms we need to fill out.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.005
Oh. Okay.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.815
<i>(Ragtime music playing)</i>

23:03.849 --> 23:05.983

23:06.018 --> 23:07.819
John: When you said guys'
night, I thought you meant like

23:07.853 --> 23:10.088
a sports bar or something. (Chuckles)

23:10.122 --> 23:12.824
We haven't been here in, like, forever.

23:12.858 --> 23:15.760
Is this really what you wanna do?

23:15.794 --> 23:17.829
Heck yeah. I love this place.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.797
They got everything... skee ball,

23:19.832 --> 23:21.032
air hockey, go-carts.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.033
Mm.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.837
Your mom and Bay.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.038
Surprise!

23:27.072 --> 23:28.039
Family night!

23:28.073 --> 23:29.774
(Sighs deeply)

23:36.010 --> 23:39.078
So, how are things going at Toby's?

23:39.393 --> 23:41.627
Oh, we're having a blast.

23:41.662 --> 23:44.363
Grilling a lot of exotic meats.

23:44.398 --> 23:47.400
I've been getting a lot of writing done.

23:47.434 --> 23:49.302
Oh, that's fantastic.

23:49.336 --> 23:50.536
Should have kicked me out years ago.

23:50.571 --> 23:52.605
We were just talking about

23:52.639 --> 23:54.574
all the great memories that we've had here.

23:54.693 --> 23:56.360
My seventh birthday.

23:56.395 --> 23:59.296
The night my little league
team won the championship.

23:59.331 --> 24:01.699
But you know what my
all-time favorite memory is?

24:01.733 --> 24:05.369
The time the four of us
conquered "the pig's trough."

24:05.404 --> 24:06.637
- Uh...
- That's very sweet of you two...

24:06.672 --> 24:08.673
<i>- (bell clanging)
- Here you go.</i>

24:08.707 --> 24:10.675
One pig's trough.

24:10.709 --> 24:12.343
<i>You guys know the rules.</i>

24:12.377 --> 24:13.477
You've got 15 minutes.

24:13.512 --> 24:14.645
<i>If you clean the trough</i>

24:14.680 --> 24:16.313
<i>like good little piggies,</i>

24:16.348 --> 24:17.415
<i>we put your picture up on the wall.</i>

24:17.449 --> 24:18.416
<i>Ready,</i>

24:18.450 --> 24:19.550
set,

24:19.584 --> 24:21.285
go.

24:21.319 --> 24:22.720
Well, let's go. Time's a-wastin'.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.622
- Come on.
- You're kidding, right?

24:24.656 --> 24:25.723
<i>- No way.
- Hey, we've done it before.</i>

24:25.757 --> 24:27.258
10 years ago.

24:27.292 --> 24:28.426
You know I gotta go easy on this

24:28.460 --> 24:30.294
- since the heart attack.
- Suck it up!

24:30.328 --> 24:31.429
We are the Kennishes.

24:31.463 --> 24:32.697
There is no challenge that we can't face.

24:32.731 --> 24:34.398

24:34.433 --> 24:35.633
Together.

25:06.732 --> 25:10.301

25:19.611 --> 25:21.512

25:21.546 --> 25:23.614
It's the best commute ever.

25:50.709 --> 25:51.675

27:07.452 --> 27:08.686
Aw, so close.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.354
- Maybe next time.
- No!

27:10.388 --> 27:12.289
The timer's busted. I
wanna talk to the manager.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.493
Well, you two could have at least tried.

27:17.696 --> 27:20.264
Maybe we should just call it a night.

27:20.298 --> 27:21.432
I feel pretty gross.

27:21.466 --> 27:22.600
No, we can't call it a night.

27:22.634 --> 27:24.368
We're here as a family

27:24.402 --> 27:25.603
to have fun and remember

27:25.637 --> 27:27.471
how happy we are.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.575
You know what I remember about this place?

27:31.610 --> 27:33.377
Yes! Thank you. Finally.

27:33.411 --> 27:37.448
I remember bringing you and
Toby here alone most of the time,

27:37.482 --> 27:39.450
because your dad was
always out on the road.

27:39.484 --> 27:41.719
Not exactly what I was going for.

27:41.753 --> 27:44.588
Well, you know what I remember?

27:44.623 --> 27:47.691
I remember all the
passive-aggressive guilt trips I got

27:47.726 --> 27:50.361
because I was off doing my job.

27:50.395 --> 27:52.596
A job that has given
this family everything,

27:52.631 --> 27:55.466
including, I might add, your new book deal.

27:57.235 --> 27:58.302
(Exhales)

27:58.336 --> 28:00.437
Why don't you two go play in the arcade?

28:00.472 --> 28:01.605
Yeah, here's a couple of bucks.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.440
Knock yourself out.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.683
If this guy doesn't come soon, my
mom is gonna know something is up.

28:12.717 --> 28:14.518
<i>- He should be here any minute.

- Mom, wait.
- No.

28:25.730 --> 28:27.298
These people, they're trying to lock me up.

28:27.332 --> 28:28.599
It's not like that.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.301
Please, they just wanna talk.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.635
I said we are going now.

28:44.783 --> 28:46.450
Is Jorge here?

28:47.652 --> 28:49.253
Any of the other nurses?

28:49.287 --> 28:51.488
No, just us. Why?

28:53.458 --> 28:54.525
Call 9-1-1.

28:55.760 --> 28:56.660
(Gasps) Oh, my God!

28:56.695 --> 28:57.661
She stabbed you.

28:57.696 --> 28:59.229
Oh, no no.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.468

29:08.296 --> 29:10.130
I texted 9-1-1. They're on their way.

29:10.164 --> 29:12.065
I need your help.

29:13.078 --> 29:14.879
It's a tension pneumothorax.

29:16.181 --> 29:18.149
Pretty soon I won't be able to breathe.

29:18.183 --> 29:20.117
I don't... I don't understand.

29:20.152 --> 29:23.120
Air is getting into my chest...

29:23.155 --> 29:25.256
(Gasping breaths) ... Pressing on my lungs.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.058
What should I do?

29:27.092 --> 29:30.928
(Inhales deeply) Get my
medical kit over there.

29:40.238 --> 29:42.306
Take the needle...

29:42.340 --> 29:44.041
Open my shirt...

29:45.077 --> 29:47.278
and take the plunger out.

29:47.312 --> 29:49.113
Oh, my God.

29:49.147 --> 29:51.048
(Gulps)

29:51.083 --> 29:53.217
- Like this?
- Yeah.

29:53.251 --> 29:54.385
Now, use your fingers

29:54.419 --> 29:57.054
and find the top of my rib cage...

29:57.089 --> 29:59.924
<i>second intercostal space.</i>

30:01.293 --> 30:04.061
Second and third rib.

30:05.997 --> 30:08.032
There. Okay...

30:08.066 --> 30:09.233
Insert the needle.

30:09.267 --> 30:11.202
Wait, you want...

30:11.236 --> 30:13.170
- you want me to...
- Pop it.

30:13.205 --> 30:14.305
(Inhales sharply) Like a balloon.

30:14.339 --> 30:16.207
That can't be right.

30:16.241 --> 30:18.075
It's the only way.

30:26.985 --> 30:29.053
The paramedics will be here any second.

30:29.087 --> 30:30.221
I... it can't wait.

30:30.255 --> 30:32.156
Can't breathe.

We wait.

31:11.181 --> 31:13.148
<i>(Ambulance sirens wailing)</i>

What are you talking about?

31:30.066 --> 31:31.367
You know what I mean.

31:31.401 --> 31:33.369
Is that why you wanted me on the team?

You been talking to your mom, haven't you?

31:36.072 --> 31:38.374
I told you. Like a virus.

31:38.408 --> 31:40.409
Just tell me the truth.

31:40.443 --> 31:43.045
You brought East Riverside to me.

31:43.079 --> 31:46.048
I brought you one building.

31:46.082 --> 31:48.284
You didn't tell me about
your plans for development

31:48.318 --> 31:51.186
until after I signed a contract
to work for you exclusively.

31:52.355 --> 31:54.089
You came to me for a loan.

31:54.124 --> 31:55.257

31:58.461 --> 32:01.430
Do I think you have
talent as a designer? Yes.

32:01.464 --> 32:03.198
Does it help me that you're
from the neighborhood?

32:03.233 --> 32:04.333
Yes.

32:04.367 --> 32:07.136
I will find a way to
get you back your money.

32:07.203 --> 32:09.204
Aw, come on. You're really
gonna throw this all away?

32:09.239 --> 32:11.307
<i>This is how business works.</i>

32:11.341 --> 32:13.142
I'm using you; You're using me.

32:13.176 --> 32:16.011
The people of East Riverside...
they get the benefit.

32:16.046 --> 32:17.446
Well, that's gonna have
to happen without me.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.381
(Exhales)

32:19.416 --> 32:21.283
I guess if that's the way you feel, fine.

32:21.318 --> 32:23.218
But at least take the
night to think about it.

32:23.253 --> 32:24.286
I don't need the night.

32:24.321 --> 32:27.122
Are you sure?

32:27.157 --> 32:30.125
'Cause breach of contract
suits, they're complicated.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.427
They take a lot of
money and years in court.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.464
I mean, my lawyers, they
live for that kind of stuff.

32:37.367 --> 32:39.435
I don't think they're so fun.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.247
You did good.

33:05.475 --> 33:07.411
_

33:07.427 --> 33:09.264
Oh. I don't mind.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.302
I'm sorry about Travis.

33:13.303 --> 33:16.159
_

33:18.174 --> 33:22.077
Has he ever talked to
you about his parents?

33:22.078 --> 33:24.707
_

33:24.714 --> 33:29.051
I've tried asking him
about them a few times,

33:29.085 --> 33:31.220
and he always shuts me down.

33:32.420 --> 33:38.177
_

33:38.528 --> 33:42.213
I wonder if that's why
he blew off the interview.

33:42.214 --> 33:43.256
_

33:44.434 --> 33:48.470
I think this house is his first real home.

33:48.505 --> 33:52.408
It's like he finally found a nest

33:52.442 --> 33:55.110
just in time to get kicked out of it.

33:58.048 --> 33:59.281
I don't know. Did I sign all that right?

33:59.282 --> 34:02.450
_

34:02.452 --> 34:04.153
Okay.

34:08.058 --> 34:09.257
We should have known this
was gonna be a bad plan.

34:09.292 --> 34:10.391
At least we got 'em talking.

34:10.427 --> 34:11.460
Yay us.

34:11.494 --> 34:13.429
Check it out. Is that an iPod?

34:13.463 --> 34:14.996
Where?

34:15.031 --> 34:16.331
Behind the cheetah turtle.

34:16.366 --> 34:18.000
Oh, it is so my turn.

34:19.369 --> 34:22.404
I am not gonna apologize
for wanting to have a career.

34:22.438 --> 34:25.107
When we first got married,
that was the plan, remember?

34:25.141 --> 34:27.042
And then Toby came along,

34:27.077 --> 34:29.043
and six months turned into a year.

34:29.079 --> 34:30.279
And then I got pregnant again.

34:30.313 --> 34:32.313
We never stopped to ask ourselves:

34:32.348 --> 34:34.083
Is this what we really want?

34:34.117 --> 34:36.185
I never said you had to
stay home with the kids.

34:36.219 --> 34:38.087
No, you never actually said it.

34:38.121 --> 34:40.089
Come on, John.

34:40.123 --> 34:42.424
You can't even handle me
going out of town for two days

34:42.458 --> 34:44.092
without going off the rails.

34:44.127 --> 34:45.427
You know, I'm not gonna explain that again.

34:45.462 --> 34:47.396
I've apologized like a thousand times.

34:47.429 --> 34:49.063
So why don't you just tell me

34:49.099 --> 34:51.433
what the hell it is that you want?

34:51.467 --> 34:54.168
I want you to hear me.

34:54.204 --> 34:56.338
I'm not happy.

34:56.371 --> 34:58.073
And I don't think you are either.

34:58.108 --> 34:59.975
What do you want me to say?

35:00.009 --> 35:01.343
I'm not happy? Okay. I'm not happy.

35:01.377 --> 35:03.078
Thank you.

35:03.113 --> 35:04.246
Do you know why I'm not happy?

35:04.280 --> 35:07.049
I'm not happy, because you keep telling me

35:07.083 --> 35:08.217
how unhappy you are.

35:11.321 --> 35:12.287
<i>Toby: You're almost there.</i>

35:12.322 --> 35:13.455
Now just drop the claw.

35:18.228 --> 35:19.361
<i>John: Let's look at the scoreboard.</i>

35:19.395 --> 35:22.097
I've made one mistake in 20 years.

35:22.132 --> 35:24.366
Other than that, I've been
a pretty damn good husband.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.102
And I have given you a great life.

35:27.137 --> 35:28.470
You're a great provider.

35:28.505 --> 35:30.072
You are.

35:30.106 --> 35:32.074
But let's just be honest.

35:32.108 --> 35:34.243
We don't have very much in common anymore.

35:34.277 --> 35:35.310
Except for the kids.

35:35.345 --> 35:37.479
You're being ridiculous!
We have tons in common.

35:37.514 --> 35:39.348
Like what exactly?

35:39.382 --> 35:42.017
I don't know. Like our
friends, like the club.

35:42.051 --> 35:43.452
Do you know how sad that sounds?

35:43.486 --> 35:45.454
Is that what we're gonna
do for the next 30 years?

35:45.488 --> 35:48.023
Sit around the country club till we die?

35:48.057 --> 35:50.125
And what would be so bad about that?

35:50.160 --> 35:51.293
Last chance.

35:51.327 --> 35:53.228
Okay.

35:53.263 --> 35:55.330
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

36:01.137 --> 36:02.337
- You got it! Sweet!
- Aah!

36:02.372 --> 36:04.106
Now just get it to the drop zone.

36:04.140 --> 36:06.208
Aah.

36:06.242 --> 36:08.043
Dude, you totally had it.

36:10.146 --> 36:11.346
<i>Hey.</i>

36:11.381 --> 36:14.082
- What's wrong?
- (Exhales)

36:14.117 --> 36:15.350
We're going in different directions.

36:15.385 --> 36:18.353
No. You are going in a different direction.

36:18.388 --> 36:20.289
I am where I have always been.

36:20.323 --> 36:22.424
And if all of a sudden, that
is not good enough for you,

36:22.458 --> 36:24.193
then that is your problem.

36:24.227 --> 36:25.394
Guys.

36:25.428 --> 36:27.129
There's something wrong with Bay.

36:30.099 --> 36:31.466
<i>- Honey, what is it?
- I... I don't know.</i>

36:31.501 --> 36:33.168
But I can't move my fingers.

36:52.398 --> 36:55.166
I swear I didn't know.

36:55.201 --> 36:58.336
She was talking crazy the
whole way home from the clinic.

36:58.370 --> 37:00.338
I didn't know anything until
the cops came to arrest her.

37:02.308 --> 37:04.209
That poor doctor.

37:04.243 --> 37:06.010
He was just trying to help us.

37:06.045 --> 37:08.179
He's gonna be okay.

37:10.983 --> 37:12.951
I feel so bad.

37:15.154 --> 37:16.354
I should have known better.

37:16.388 --> 37:20.091
I should have gotten
her help a long time ago.

37:24.163 --> 37:26.030
My mom stabbed someone.

37:26.065 --> 37:28.299
Sharee, it's not your fault.

37:28.334 --> 37:30.401
What if she goes to jail?

37:30.436 --> 37:32.403
I mean...

37:34.139 --> 37:35.306
What's gonna happen to me?

37:44.183 --> 37:46.985
She has two lacerated tendons.
Middle and index fingers.

37:47.019 --> 37:49.320
It's likely that they were partially
severed from the original injury.

37:49.355 --> 37:51.155
How come we didn't know about that?

37:51.190 --> 37:54.392
The E.R. made the best guess they
could before they sewed her up.

37:54.426 --> 37:56.961
But there's really no way
for us to tell for sure

37:56.996 --> 37:58.296
until something like this happens.

37:58.330 --> 38:00.865
So...

38:00.870 --> 38:02.871
- What do we do?
- We'll get in there

38:02.905 --> 38:04.839
and we'll surgically repair the tendons.

38:04.874 --> 38:06.241
And what's the recovery time?

38:06.275 --> 38:08.943
We can usually expect movement
within a couple months.

38:10.012 --> 38:11.212
Bay's an artist.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.248
She uses her right hand for everything.

38:15.184 --> 38:17.152
Will she still be able to paint and draw?

38:20.122 --> 38:21.189
We'll do our best.

38:32.867 --> 38:34.924
_

38:37.340 --> 38:40.356
_

38:41.661 --> 38:44.969
_

38:44.970 --> 38:47.999
_

38:48.000 --> 38:51.532
_

38:51.533 --> 38:55.161
_

38:55.162 --> 38:59.131
_

39:00.214 --> 39:02.841
_

39:02.842 --> 39:06.113
_

39:08.005 --> 39:09.326
_

39:10.905 --> 39:14.536
_

39:14.537 --> 39:16.092
_

39:17.340 --> 39:19.313
_

39:22.318 --> 39:23.918
Oh.

39:23.919 --> 39:25.050
_

39:26.021 --> 39:26.988
Hey.

39:31.945 --> 39:35.262
_

39:35.263 --> 39:38.608
_

39:38.610 --> 39:40.835
Aw, darn.

39:40.869 --> 39:43.037
I already asked out the
cute history teacher.

39:46.275 --> 39:47.909
I'm... I'm kidding.

39:49.078 --> 39:50.011
(Laughs)

39:52.220 --> 39:53.539
_

39:53.540 --> 39:55.730
_

39:55.884 --> 39:56.851
Okay.

39:58.921 --> 40:00.054
See you later.

40:07.062 --> 40:08.029
I'll see you at the house.

40:08.063 --> 40:10.999
What? Why?

40:11.033 --> 40:13.134
Kathryn, I'm coming home.

40:13.168 --> 40:16.170
Bay needs us right now. Both of us.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.338
I agree.

40:17.373 --> 40:21.009
But it doesn't mean that
we have to live together.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.144
Okay, this is ridiculous. All right?

40:23.178 --> 40:25.146
- Stop playing games.
- I'm not playing games.

40:25.180 --> 40:27.081
I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

40:27.116 --> 40:29.083
And...

40:29.118 --> 40:30.151
Maybe you're right.

40:30.185 --> 40:33.288
- Okay, look...
- Maybe it is my problem.

40:33.322 --> 40:36.190
I'm the one who's changed.

40:36.225 --> 40:39.193
And this life that we've created...

40:41.930 --> 40:44.032
it's not the life I want anymore.

40:52.041 --> 40:54.275
Even if we had the room,

40:54.310 --> 40:57.045
Sharee has to go to an actual foster home.

40:58.881 --> 41:01.916
She has this great aunt
that she's never met

41:01.950 --> 41:04.052
coming in from Miami to live with her.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.119
Well, she'll be with relatives.

41:05.154 --> 41:06.120
That'll be good for her.

41:06.155 --> 41:08.056
(Sighs)

41:08.090 --> 41:09.223
I guess.

41:09.258 --> 41:12.293
I just wanted her to see what it was like

41:12.328 --> 41:14.295
to be a part of a real family.

41:14.330 --> 41:16.197
And not just us.

41:16.231 --> 41:19.334
Everyone deserves the
royal Kennish treatment

41:19.368 --> 41:22.103
at least once.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.272
Ahem.

41:24.306 --> 41:27.075
There's something I have to tell you.

41:27.109 --> 41:30.044
I was sort of hoping that
it would work itself out,

41:30.079 --> 41:31.979
but now I'm not so sure.

41:32.014 --> 41:34.282
What's going on?

41:36.018 --> 41:37.251
It's about John and Kathryn.

41:40.055 --> 41:42.023
When we came home from
Sharee's the other night...
