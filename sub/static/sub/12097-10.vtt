<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:04.571 --> 00:06.572
<i>Dutch and Eunice decided</i>
<i>to run away together,</i>

00:06.573 --> 00:09.074

00:09.075 --> 00:11.076
<i>Chester still has</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:14.580
<i>Elaine is no longer being awful,</i>

00:14.581 --> 00:17.082
<i>and therefore,</i>
<i>Danny and Elaine's relationship</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:18.584
<i>is not only no longer awful,</i>

00:18.585 --> 00:21.086
<i>but is actually awful nice.</i>

00:21.087 --> 00:23.088
<i>And even though Burt thinks</i>
<i>Mary cheated on him</i>

00:23.089 --> 00:24.590
<i>with her awful professor</i>

00:24.591 --> 00:26.091

00:26.092 --> 00:28.594
<i>he feels more awful</i>
<i>that he cheated on her,</i>

00:28.595 --> 00:30.596
<i>and the most awful thing</i>
<i>about all of this is...</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:33.098
<i>Mary didn't cheat</i>
<i>with the awful professor.</i>

00:33.099 --> 00:34.600

Don't move or I'll shoot you.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.669
Don't shoot, Mrs. Tate.
It's only me, Dutch.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.672
Oh, good,
because I don't have a gun.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.676
But you're in the wrong room.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.678
Eunice's room is down the roof,
around the eaves,

01:52.679 --> 01:53.679
green organdy curtains.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.180
You can't miss it.

01:55.181 --> 01:57.182
I know. I came to see you.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.184
You see, Eunice and I
are running away together,

01:59.185 --> 02:01.186
and I wanted
to get your blessing.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.689
I know.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.692
Eunice told me.
You're going to live on a farm.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.193
It's so romantic.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.696
[MUMBLING]

02:10.697 --> 02:11.697
Hello, dear.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.198
Hi. How you doing?

02:13.199 --> 02:15.200
What the hell are you doing
in my wife's bedroom?

02:15.201 --> 02:16.702
Well, I just came by...
I don't care.

02:16.703 --> 02:21.206
Get out.
The both of you.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.208
My wife will drop dead
if she sees you in her bed.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.211
Chester, I am your wife.

02:26.212 --> 02:28.714
Is everything okay?

02:28.715 --> 02:29.716
I'm almost ready.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.217
Who is she?

02:32.218 --> 02:33.719
That's Eunice.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
Does she belong to you?

02:34.721 --> 02:36.221
Yeah, kind of.

02:36.222 --> 02:39.725
Good. Then get her
out of here.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.727
I'll just go get a few things.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.228
I may not remember anything,

02:43.229 --> 02:45.230
but one thing
I am pretty sure of...

02:45.231 --> 02:48.234
bedrooms are not supposed
to be this crowded.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.236
Mrs. Tate?
Yes?

02:51.237 --> 02:52.738
I want you to know

02:52.739 --> 02:54.239
that I'll take really
good care of Eunice.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.741
I know you're not too thrilled,

02:55.742 --> 02:57.743
her running away
with a killer, but...

02:57.744 --> 03:00.747
Aw, listen.
I'm married to a killer.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.249
Still, I don't think

03:04.250 --> 03:05.751
that this is what
you had in mind

03:05.752 --> 03:07.252
for your daughter.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.755
Well, I guess not, but...

03:09.756 --> 03:12.257
Dutch, tell me.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.259
Did you really kill a man?

03:14.260 --> 03:15.761
Yeah.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.764
Dead? You shot him dead?

03:18.765 --> 03:21.767
That's usually what happens
in a successful killing.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.769
Of course.

03:23.770 --> 03:24.770
You see, what happened is

03:24.771 --> 03:26.271
that when I got out of the Navy,

03:26.272 --> 03:28.273
I borrowed some money
to go into business.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.775
The banks all turned me down
for a loan,

03:29.776 --> 03:31.777
so I went
to a local loan company.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.279
They gave me $5000
at a very high rate of interest.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.781
And the first week,

03:35.782 --> 03:37.282
when I couldn't
come up with the dough,

03:37.283 --> 03:38.283
they broke my fingers.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.284
The second week,

03:39.285 --> 03:41.787
they broke my nose and two ribs
and my knee.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.288
Plus, the guy
that was beating me up

03:43.289 --> 03:44.289
had a very bad cold,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.792
so I ended up
with a terrible cough.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.794
The next week,
they was gonna break my head,

03:48.795 --> 03:49.795
but I convinced them not to.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.296
How?

03:51.297 --> 03:54.800
I talked to them for a while,
and then I shot them.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.803
Oh, well, I think that should be
considered self-defense.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.304
It was.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.806
But the guy who owned
the loan company

04:00.807 --> 04:03.308
turned out to be
the chief of police.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.310
I'm ready.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.812
Will you take my bags
downstairs?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.814
Okay. You'd better hurry up.
It's getting late.

04:08.815 --> 04:09.815
Okay.

04:09.816 --> 04:11.817
Daddy?

04:11.818 --> 04:12.818
Daddy?

04:12.819 --> 04:13.819
Hmm? What?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.321
Daddy, I'm leaving,

04:16.322 --> 04:18.824
and I wanted to tell you
how much I love you.

04:18.825 --> 04:19.825
Oh.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.326
Daddy...

04:21.327 --> 04:23.829
I've been a very lucky girl,

04:23.830 --> 04:25.831
and you have been
a wonderful father,

04:25.832 --> 04:27.833
and I hate leaving you now.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.334
I wish there was
something I could do

04:29.335 --> 04:31.336
to make things better for you,

04:31.337 --> 04:33.839
but I guess there isn't,
so I guess all I can do

04:33.840 --> 04:37.342
is just let you know
how much I love you.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.345
And get well, Daddy, okay?

04:40.346 --> 04:43.348
I love you. Goodbye.

04:43.349 --> 04:47.853
I want you to know
that was a very touching speech,

04:47.854 --> 04:50.857
and I'd really be moved
if I only knew who you were.

04:52.859 --> 04:53.860
Okay.

04:56.863 --> 04:57.863
Goodbye, Mother.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.364
Goodbye, darling.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.866
I'll write.
I know.

05:00.867 --> 05:01.868
Okay.
Bye-bye.

05:07.373 --> 05:10.375
Our little girl.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.378
She's enormous
for a little girl.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.379
Chester,

05:14.380 --> 05:16.381
what I mean is

05:16.382 --> 05:18.884
I still think of her
as a little girl.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.887
Oh.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.889
She must have been
a very sweet little girl.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.893
She was. Adorable.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.897
It's all lost to me.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.399
All of it.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.402
My past, my present, my future.

05:37.403 --> 05:38.904
It's all gone.

05:40.406 --> 05:44.910
I try...
I try so hard to remember,

05:44.911 --> 05:47.913
and I can't.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.916
I'm so afraid
if I don't remember soon,

05:50.917 --> 05:51.918
you'll have me put away.

05:54.420 --> 05:58.924
You've all been so good to me,
I...

05:58.925 --> 06:00.425
I must have been some guy

06:00.426 --> 06:01.927
to have
such a beautiful bunch of people

06:01.928 --> 06:03.428
love me the way that you do.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.931
Chester...

06:05.932 --> 06:08.433
It's agony...

06:08.434 --> 06:11.436
to know I have
a wonderful son and daughters

06:11.437 --> 06:12.437
and a wife

06:12.438 --> 06:16.441
and not know who they are.

06:16.442 --> 06:20.946
Sometimes, I swear
it's almost too much to bear.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.447
Oh, Chester.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.450
I just know it:
someday, you'll remember.

and visit my favorite mother.

When I was 20, I could compete.

Age has taught me
to be philosophical, to accept.

I can't do anything about it,
and I accept it.

He's been missing
since yesterday.

You must be frantic.

Well, not really.

You see, the other day,

09:22.628 --> 09:25.630
Chester said he needed
his net stockings.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.633
He thinks he's Marlene Dietrich.

09:28.634 --> 09:32.637
And net stockings in his size
may be very hard to find, Mary.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.656
Yeah.

you're not gay.

No, Aunt Jessica. It doesn't.

there was no such thing
as homosexuals.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.169
Yes, there were, Aunt Jessica.
