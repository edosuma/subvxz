WEBVTT

00:03.310 --> 00:04.643
Hmm.

00:07.081 --> 00:10.316
How long has it been
since your last confession?

00:10.718 --> 00:14.621
Since I found out God isn't
the only who answers prayers.

00:21.762 --> 00:24.062
Do you have any idea how easy it would be

00:24.064 --> 00:25.597
for me to kill you right now?

00:25.599 --> 00:28.433
How much I'd enjoy that?

00:28.435 --> 00:32.003
but he... he still has plans for you.

00:32.006 --> 00:34.806
Tell Enos I won't back down.

00:34.808 --> 00:37.976
When Enos gets through with you,

00:37.978 --> 00:39.811
you're gonna be begging for your death.

00:39.813 --> 00:42.981
And it will come very
soon, he promised me that.

00:42.983 --> 00:44.416
I just wanted to make sure you spend

00:44.418 --> 00:46.118
your last precious moments thinking about

00:46.120 --> 00:47.853
all those innocent people
who are going to suffer

00:47.855 --> 00:49.488
because of you.

00:51.358 --> 00:54.593
By the way, how many Hail Marys

00:54.595 --> 00:55.627
for me to atone for having impure thoughts

00:55.629 --> 00:57.629
about a young girl?

00:57.631 --> 00:59.464
A young girl like your daughter.

00:59.466 --> 01:01.700
Reverend?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:16.283 --> 01:20.285
Where is he?

01:20.287 --> 01:21.720
Where is he?

01:54.254 --> 01:57.723
The world is a savage place.

01:57.725 --> 02:01.593
Sometimes, it only gives you two choices...

02:01.595 --> 02:06.031
Kill or be killed.

02:06.033 --> 02:09.701
Either way, you're damned.

02:09.703 --> 02:11.370
- David.
- Hmm?

02:11.372 --> 02:12.738
Can you hear me?

02:12.740 --> 02:14.573
Jesus, you had me scared.

02:14.575 --> 02:16.108
You've been out of it all night.

02:16.110 --> 02:18.443
That son of a bitch shot
me full of something.

02:18.445 --> 02:19.911
Who?

02:19.913 --> 02:22.781
The Society of Sons
cracker... Dean Parsing.

02:22.783 --> 02:26.218
David, I thought you were possessed.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.253
I never seen anything like this before.

02:28.255 --> 02:30.288
He got in my head. He
told me it was something

02:30.290 --> 02:32.057
called mother's milk. Oh, my God!

02:32.059 --> 02:33.625
What did I do?

02:33.627 --> 02:35.027
Don't worry.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.595
- I handled the Rev.
- Does Grace know?

02:36.597 --> 02:37.696
Is he okay?

02:37.698 --> 02:38.864
All right, can you drive?

02:38.866 --> 02:40.432
- Yeah, why?
- Great, come on...

02:40.434 --> 02:41.867
I need you to get her out of here.

02:41.869 --> 02:43.201
Some place safe where the two of you

02:43.203 --> 02:44.736
can lay low for a while. Can you do that?

02:44.738 --> 02:46.104
Forget it. I'm going with you.

02:46.106 --> 02:48.073
No, not this time, David.

02:48.075 --> 02:49.975
I love you, but you're no warrior.

02:49.977 --> 02:51.309
What about you?

02:51.311 --> 02:52.911
I'm gonna show the Society of Sons

02:52.913 --> 02:55.380
what happens when you mess with my family.

03:53.072 --> 03:56.000
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

03:59.915 --> 04:02.417
Who the hell is Dean Parsing?

04:02.419 --> 04:05.920
I got into a situation with
his father a long time ago.

04:05.922 --> 04:07.355
About what?

04:07.357 --> 04:09.057
And don't give me that Society of Sons,

04:09.059 --> 04:11.593
white power crap. It's
more personal that that.

04:11.595 --> 04:14.329
It was over a woman.

04:14.331 --> 04:16.697
Claire... Grace's mom.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.233
Thought you said she was a one night stand.

04:18.235 --> 04:19.901
Is it any of your business
what she was to me?

04:19.903 --> 04:22.237
It becomes my business
when some white bread demon

04:22.239 --> 04:24.305
starts coming after me and my brother!

04:25.842 --> 04:28.109
Hey, I loved her, all right?

04:28.111 --> 04:30.111
And that didn't sit too well with Parsing.

04:30.113 --> 04:31.546
So what? So he had some history

04:31.548 --> 04:32.914
with Grace's mom.

04:32.916 --> 04:34.082
That just explains why he hates you,

04:34.084 --> 04:37.051
not why Enos is using him.

04:37.053 --> 04:41.189
I asked you a question. Jesus,
it's like playing chess with you.

04:41.191 --> 04:42.924
Listen to me...

04:42.926 --> 04:45.960
You're not the only one
trying to forget old wounds.

04:45.962 --> 04:48.429
There are things I'm not
ready to talk about with you

04:48.431 --> 04:53.201
or Grace or anybody until
I settle 'em with God first.

04:53.203 --> 04:56.404
All I'm asking for is a little faith.

04:56.406 --> 04:58.473
Have I steered you wrong yet?

04:58.475 --> 05:01.075
All it takes is once to get us all killed.

05:04.648 --> 05:06.314
Mother's milk clouded

05:06.316 --> 05:09.584
your mind... made you do bad things

05:09.586 --> 05:11.619
and not even remember.

05:11.621 --> 05:13.621
Dean used it on Charlotte to get to me

05:13.623 --> 05:17.458
the same way he used me to get to Bledsoe.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.827
But if there was still hope for me,

05:19.829 --> 05:22.830
that meant there was
hope for Charlotte too...

05:22.832 --> 05:25.233
maybe.

05:25.235 --> 05:27.168
You okay?

05:27.170 --> 05:29.337
My head feels strange.

05:29.339 --> 05:30.638
Why are they in a strip club?

05:30.640 --> 05:32.340
- She told us to meet her here.
- Who?

05:32.342 --> 05:34.909
Worst bachelorette party
I have ever been to.

05:34.911 --> 05:38.012
I hope her fiancÃ©'s out
getting laid somewhere.

05:38.014 --> 05:40.081
Who's this.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.984
This is Grace, the Reverend's daughter.

05:42.986 --> 05:44.819
Listen to me... this is important.

05:44.821 --> 05:47.789
You promise you haven't shot
up any more of that stuff?

05:47.791 --> 05:49.824
Oh, God. Please don't tell me

05:49.826 --> 05:51.693
this is some intervention.

05:51.695 --> 05:53.828
Only reason I haven't
called my candy man yet

05:53.830 --> 05:56.965
is 'cause you promised you were
bringing something even better.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.700
And I did... I swear.

05:58.702 --> 06:00.868
But, in return, I need a favor.

06:00.870 --> 06:02.136
A favor?

06:02.138 --> 06:05.106
My daddy says those are bad business.

06:05.108 --> 06:06.774
We need some place to hide out.

06:06.776 --> 06:08.109
- So?
- You said you had the keys

06:08.111 --> 06:09.711
to your dad's lake house.

06:11.781 --> 06:14.816
Hmm. I thought you'd never ask.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.890
Do I look like a backseat
kinda girl to you?

06:41.711 --> 06:43.011
You get a lot of visitors?

06:43.013 --> 06:46.748
No. Mostly keep to themselves.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.349
Help you with something?

06:48.351 --> 06:49.851
This is police business, Dusty.

06:49.853 --> 06:51.085
Stay out of it.

06:51.087 --> 06:52.587
- Who are you?
- Neighbor.

06:52.589 --> 06:54.222
You know these people?

06:54.224 --> 06:55.390
I know you can't walk
into someone's trailer

06:55.392 --> 06:56.958
without a court order.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.180
Ms. Abascal came to see me.

06:59.182 --> 07:00.848
She said she'd been having
some kind of a dispute

07:00.850 --> 07:03.785
with a gentlemen named Trevor Montroe?

07:03.787 --> 07:05.954
Now he's gone missing.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.755
Pale looking fella... glasses.

07:12.362 --> 07:15.597
Sorry.

07:15.599 --> 07:17.665
I should see the other guy, right?

07:17.667 --> 07:19.334
Excuse me?

07:19.336 --> 07:22.971
That bump on your head looks like
somebody nailed you pretty good.

07:22.973 --> 07:26.507
Now you're supposed to say,
"You should see the other guy."

07:28.445 --> 07:30.678
Yeah, sure.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.881
Say it.

07:33.883 --> 07:36.317
You should see the other guy.

07:36.319 --> 07:38.186
What other guy?

07:38.188 --> 07:39.988
You just admitted to assault.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.656
Now I need the man's name.

07:56.239 --> 07:58.673
You hear from Ms. Abascal,
tell her Sheriff Dickey'd

07:58.675 --> 08:01.643
- like a word.
- Will do.

08:01.645 --> 08:03.478
I'll let you know as soon
as I see her, Sheriff.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.013
Yes, Mr. Roberts?

08:07.984 --> 08:10.918
What'd she do now?

08:27.937 --> 08:29.704
Is this it?

08:29.706 --> 08:32.073
Money may not buy you happiness,

08:32.075 --> 08:34.775
but it can get you a
pretty sweet lake house.

08:47.057 --> 08:49.691
What are you looking at?

08:49.693 --> 08:51.626
The stars.

08:51.628 --> 08:55.129
What stars?

08:55.131 --> 08:56.898
Beautiful.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.367
Whatever she's on... I hope
you brought some for me.

09:07.277 --> 09:10.645
You can call it pretentious,
but Daddy and his mistress...

09:10.647 --> 09:12.046
They call it home.

09:25.829 --> 09:28.496
Don't worry... he paid
someone else to kill 'em.

09:28.498 --> 09:30.164
But, if it makes you feel any better,

09:30.166 --> 09:33.901
my head'll probably be up
there too one of these days.

09:33.903 --> 09:36.337
I can still see the life in them.

09:36.339 --> 09:40.274
Uh, that's a little
creepy, but... whatever.

09:43.513 --> 09:47.648
So, David tells me you
were away for a long time.

09:47.650 --> 09:48.916
Rehab?

09:48.918 --> 09:53.187
Not exactly.

09:53.189 --> 09:55.156
Don't be shy about it.

09:55.158 --> 09:57.759
I've been through 'em
all; rehab, psych ward,

09:57.761 --> 09:59.360
boarding school.

09:59.362 --> 10:00.661
I should go check on David.

10:00.663 --> 10:03.131
So we're clear,

10:03.133 --> 10:05.600
I'm not big on sharing my toys.

10:05.602 --> 10:08.169
David's mine.

10:08.171 --> 10:09.971
I don't mean to cause any trouble.

10:09.973 --> 10:12.640
Oh, but girls like you never do.

10:12.642 --> 10:14.642
Look, I'm sorry.

10:14.644 --> 10:17.178
It's just that David...
most guys don't care

10:17.180 --> 10:19.881
how messed up you are
inside, as long as you still

10:19.883 --> 10:22.650
look like a prom queen.

10:22.652 --> 10:24.285
Aren't you tired of the men in your life

10:24.287 --> 10:26.187
always trying to change you. To improve you

10:26.189 --> 10:29.390
when you're already so
perfect just the way you are?

10:29.392 --> 10:31.159
A&O taught me to accept myself

10:31.161 --> 10:32.994
for who I really am.

10:36.065 --> 10:40.501
- Um, did you see that?
- See what?

10:40.503 --> 10:42.236
I think I need another drink.

10:42.238 --> 10:44.505
You want one?

10:44.507 --> 10:47.809
Charlotte, maybe you
should slow down a little.

10:47.811 --> 10:50.244
You called me, remember?

10:50.246 --> 10:52.046
I'm the one doing you a favor.

10:54.651 --> 10:57.318
Now, uh, why don't we go upstairs

10:57.320 --> 11:01.055
and you can show me just
how grateful you are?

11:01.057 --> 11:03.858
I'm ready for a taste of
this new shit you brought.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.027
I lied. I didn't bring you anything.

11:06.029 --> 11:07.094
I knew this was a setup.

11:07.096 --> 11:08.696
Agh, damn it!

11:08.698 --> 11:10.431
I told you... it's not an intervention.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.066
I'm just trying to keep
you safe for a while.

11:12.068 --> 11:15.436
You hypocrite! Where do you get off?

11:15.438 --> 11:16.737
It's 'cuzza her?

11:19.709 --> 11:21.542
Charlotte, I'm sorry.
You wouldn't believe me

11:21.544 --> 11:23.911
if I told you what's really going on here.

11:23.913 --> 11:25.178
Oh, sweetie, see? That's
where you got it twisted.

11:27.683 --> 11:30.384
I've known guys like you my whole life.

11:35.391 --> 11:37.023
Hey, it's me.

11:37.025 --> 11:38.792
I need you to make a special delivery

11:38.794 --> 11:40.727
and put a rush on it.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.662
The rumors about Tetra were true.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.364
She damned her soul 20 years ago.

11:48.366 --> 11:52.802
Became one of Enos' first
followers on Sangolo.

11:52.804 --> 11:54.571
Now she swore to use her dark powers

11:54.573 --> 11:57.907
against him instead, but the devil

11:57.909 --> 12:00.376
isn't a man easily crossed.

12:24.916 --> 12:26.916
They're headed to the lake house.

12:26.918 --> 12:30.153
You sure Gracie's safe with him
after what happened last night?

12:30.155 --> 12:31.621
Whatever Dean put inside his head,

12:31.623 --> 12:35.592
David fought it, which
means he saved your life too.

12:35.594 --> 12:37.527
You asked me to trust you.

12:37.529 --> 12:41.130
Well I've trusted David with my
life more times than I can count.

12:41.132 --> 12:42.999
Anyway, this won't take long.

12:43.001 --> 12:45.935
He said Dean's place is
right up through there.

12:45.937 --> 12:47.036
Sure you wanna go in there with me?

12:47.038 --> 12:49.272
This guy wants you dead.

12:49.274 --> 12:51.941
I'm trying hard to forget the man I was.

12:51.943 --> 12:55.111
Somebody threatens my
daughter, I don't walk away.

12:55.113 --> 12:56.679
That's not gonna do any
good against a demon.

12:56.681 --> 12:58.147
Maybe not.

12:58.149 --> 13:01.684
Sometimes, there's comfort in old habits.

13:01.686 --> 13:05.154
Does Gracie know you killed a man?

13:09.227 --> 13:11.194
You hear that?

13:11.196 --> 13:14.831
What?

13:16.735 --> 13:18.067
Maria!

13:18.069 --> 13:19.402
You all right?

13:21.873 --> 13:24.073
Maria, what's wrong?

13:25.577 --> 13:27.243
That noise.

13:27.245 --> 13:28.411
What noise?

13:32.684 --> 13:34.584
God! Is she okay?

13:34.586 --> 13:35.885
Uh, I don't know what happened.

13:35.887 --> 13:39.822
Honey, what can I do to help?

13:48.833 --> 13:50.900
Poor thing.

13:50.902 --> 13:53.436
Was wondering when you'd finally show up.

13:53.438 --> 13:55.772
Dean will be so disappointed he missed you.

13:55.774 --> 13:58.775
He loves watching mother work.

13:58.777 --> 14:00.543
I told him the lake house can wait,

14:00.545 --> 14:05.048
but my boy can be so impatient.

14:06.718 --> 14:09.285
No.

14:09.287 --> 14:11.921
How did David like mother's milk?

14:11.923 --> 14:15.091
A little kiss from my veins to his.

14:15.093 --> 14:16.592
Abigail... do someth...

14:16.594 --> 14:18.861
- Abigail can't help you.
- Maria!

14:18.863 --> 14:21.064
She's the one making this hurt so bad.

14:21.066 --> 14:23.066
- But I can make it all go away.
- Maria, what's wrong?

14:23.068 --> 14:28.271
If you just stop fighting
and give me what we both want?

14:28.273 --> 14:31.207
Let me kill Abigail for you.

14:31.209 --> 14:34.243
That's right... you don't
have to suffer anymore.

14:34.245 --> 14:38.114
It can all be over now if you just let go.

14:38.116 --> 14:39.449
Stay away.

14:39.451 --> 14:41.284
What did you say?

14:41.286 --> 14:42.885
Stay away.

14:42.887 --> 14:45.888
- You guys all right?
- It's okay.

14:45.890 --> 14:48.257
Uh, it's okay! It's okay... I'll call 911.

14:53.665 --> 14:56.499
I'll see you again very soon.

14:56.501 --> 15:00.503
And next time, I won't bother asking.

15:05.677 --> 15:08.244
I'm worried, I'm gonna go get a doctor.

15:08.246 --> 15:12.615
Thank you.

15:19.571 --> 15:22.206
What if the world stopped demanding

15:22.208 --> 15:25.209
and started listening to your demands?

15:25.211 --> 15:30.281
What if other people's mistakes
didn't become your problems?

15:30.283 --> 15:32.149
What if there was a way to
cut through all the noise

15:32.151 --> 15:36.420
in your life and find
perfect peace and clarity?

15:36.422 --> 15:38.289
Now you can.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.925
The A&O Life Success
Seminar... Cut through the noise

15:40.927 --> 15:43.894
and help you take life back.

15:43.896 --> 15:46.730
Maria.

15:49.435 --> 15:51.635
This doesn't change a thing between us.

15:51.637 --> 15:53.504
I want you out.

15:53.506 --> 15:55.339
Not until we can stop Dean and that thing

15:55.341 --> 15:56.840
from hurting anyone else.

15:56.842 --> 15:58.776
Who the hell was that back there?

15:58.778 --> 16:00.911
I used to hear stories back in hell

16:00.913 --> 16:03.614
about a mad demon called Javorsura.

16:03.616 --> 16:05.249
What?

16:05.251 --> 16:07.685
Story goes that her madness was contagious.

16:07.687 --> 16:11.255
Would drive crazy any other
demons that get too close.

16:11.257 --> 16:13.624
Scrambles everything. Makes us powerless.

16:13.626 --> 16:17.027
Looks like the old lady must
be the mad demon's new host.

16:17.029 --> 16:18.662
What are we supposed to do?

16:18.664 --> 16:21.298
You stay as far away from her as possible

16:21.300 --> 16:23.167
or you'll get us both killed.

16:29.775 --> 16:31.041
You okay?

16:31.043 --> 16:32.643
That woman is Dean Parsing's mother.

16:32.645 --> 16:34.011
They know where David is.

16:34.013 --> 16:36.046
We have to go to the lake house right now.

16:36.048 --> 16:38.315
I just tried Grace... she didn't answer.

16:38.317 --> 16:42.219
Then start praying we're
not too late already.

16:56.002 --> 16:57.668
Something wrong with your lunch?

16:57.670 --> 16:59.370
No, it's fine.

16:59.372 --> 17:00.738
That's the longest I've ever seen

17:00.740 --> 17:03.140
anyone ever take finishing
a plate of catfish.

17:03.142 --> 17:04.742
I wasn't as hungry as I thought.

17:07.046 --> 17:08.412
- Thank you.
- The reverend wasn't there

17:08.414 --> 17:09.646
when I stopped by the church this morning.

17:09.647 --> 17:11.315
Any idea when he's coming back?

17:11.317 --> 17:15.752
It's about fixing the church
or you need to confess?

17:15.755 --> 17:19.323
Actually, uh...

17:19.325 --> 17:22.893
Didn't know you were the religious type.

17:22.895 --> 17:26.230
Maybe I'm just trying to cover my bases.

17:26.232 --> 17:29.566
- That's not how it works.
- Then tell me what does.

17:29.568 --> 17:32.236
I used to think that God had all the power.

17:32.238 --> 17:36.940
Then how do you explain why
the world's all messed up?

17:36.942 --> 17:39.109
The world is full of pain.

17:39.111 --> 17:40.677
No one has a monopoly on that.

17:40.679 --> 17:42.513
You have no idea what I've seen.

17:42.515 --> 17:44.014
I watched a man take my daughter's life

17:44.016 --> 17:46.550
right in front of me.

17:46.552 --> 17:50.187
I listened to her begging for mercy

17:50.189 --> 17:51.522
and there wasn't anything
I could do about it.

17:51.524 --> 17:53.624
You don't blame God for that?

17:53.626 --> 17:57.061
Every day, but believe me...

17:57.063 --> 17:59.229
Be very careful what you worship.

17:59.231 --> 18:00.964
Hey, Tetra, we got orders
stacking up back here.

18:00.966 --> 18:02.466
I'm talking with a customer!

18:02.468 --> 18:04.401
Well he's not the only customer we got!

18:07.239 --> 18:08.705
I'll tell the reverend
you're looking for him.

18:13.379 --> 18:16.980
Grace.

18:16.982 --> 18:18.916
Who's there?

18:26.248 --> 18:29.383
You okay?

18:29.385 --> 18:31.752
I feel strange.

18:31.754 --> 18:34.588
Like... nevermind.

18:34.590 --> 18:37.024
It's okay. Tell me.

18:37.026 --> 18:39.526
Like the world's trying
to show me something.

18:39.528 --> 18:41.562
Wanna lie down?

18:41.564 --> 18:43.096
No.

18:43.098 --> 18:45.832
I like talking to you.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.534
Sorry about Charlotte.

18:47.536 --> 18:50.103
It's not her fault. She's just...

18:50.105 --> 18:51.505
I don't know.

18:51.507 --> 18:54.675
She's not used to not getting her way.

18:54.677 --> 18:58.111
She your girlfriend?

18:58.113 --> 18:59.947
We bring out the bad in each other,

18:59.949 --> 19:03.383
so I guess that's a sort of bond.

19:04.954 --> 19:08.689
David... what happened last night?

19:08.691 --> 19:11.758
There's just been some
trouble... that's all.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.760
Something with my father?

19:13.762 --> 19:15.229
Yeah.

19:15.231 --> 19:16.897
He doesn't tell me anything.

19:16.899 --> 19:18.899
He keeps treating me like
the kid I was ten years ago.

19:18.901 --> 19:23.637
I guess that's just the
way he still remembers you.

19:23.639 --> 19:27.574
What about you?

19:27.576 --> 19:30.143
Well, I like the way you are now.

19:42.491 --> 19:43.724
Gracie.

19:49.765 --> 19:51.898
I shouldn't have done that.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.801
No.

19:57.273 --> 19:58.505
Who's that?

20:07.750 --> 20:11.685
David! David! The Candyman's here.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.493
That was fast.

20:19.495 --> 20:21.695
Oh, man, am I glad to see you.

20:21.697 --> 20:24.131
Oh, baby, you missed me, didn't you?

20:24.133 --> 20:27.134
Maybe I did.

20:31.206 --> 20:33.540
This, uh, too much?

20:33.542 --> 20:37.377
Or not enough?

20:37.379 --> 20:38.812
Ah.

20:43.886 --> 20:45.686
You need to go.

20:45.688 --> 20:47.688
- What does he want?
- Don't worry about it.

20:47.690 --> 20:48.889
I can help you.

20:48.891 --> 20:50.524
No, this is my mess.

20:50.526 --> 20:51.858
Go up to the trophy room, grab a rifle,

20:51.860 --> 20:53.460
and lock the door.

20:53.462 --> 20:54.795
Go.

21:09.812 --> 21:12.579
Hmm. Hey, pal.

21:12.581 --> 21:14.247
All the right faces in
all the right places, huh?

21:14.249 --> 21:16.216
- I warned you, Dean.
- Hey, hey, hey.

21:16.218 --> 21:18.085
Ditch the hostility, brother.

21:18.087 --> 21:24.024
I forgive you. Cold
feet, happens sometimes.

21:24.026 --> 21:25.559
Where'd your girlfriend go?

21:25.561 --> 21:28.095
Whatever Bledsoe did,
she had no part of it.

21:28.097 --> 21:32.265
Oh, but she's a very big part in this.

21:32.267 --> 21:33.700
You both are.

21:40.709 --> 21:42.109
Where's Grace?

22:00.253 --> 22:01.853
What are you doing to him?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.890
Hey! Leave him alone!

22:05.892 --> 22:07.158
Tell me where Grace is.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.260
Please stop!

22:09.262 --> 22:11.929
I can tell you where she is
if you promise to let him go!

22:11.931 --> 22:13.498
Don't listen to her.

22:15.235 --> 22:18.169
You know, I'm no doctor but
that did not sound too good.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.572
Just please, stop hurting him!

22:23.042 --> 22:24.442
David!

22:45.965 --> 22:50.134
Welcome back, brother.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.937
Yeah, the redhead thought
she'd try playing hero.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.605
I had to give her something to shut her up.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.807
Don't hurt them.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.074
You should have thought about that

22:57.076 --> 22:58.810
before you let that black bastard go.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.245
What's this about?

23:01.247 --> 23:02.914
You didn't tell her?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.251
He was supposed to kill your...

23:07.253 --> 23:09.053
- Shut up!
- No.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.155
You still don't get it, do you?

23:11.157 --> 23:14.225
This isn't just about me
avenging my father's murder.

23:14.227 --> 23:17.929
This is about you and your father.

23:17.931 --> 23:19.964
He wants you back, Davey.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.599
I'm never going back to him.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.167
What is he talking about?

23:23.169 --> 23:25.670
Killing Bledsoe isn't your initiation

23:25.672 --> 23:28.139
into the Society of Sons.

23:28.141 --> 23:32.477
It's your initiation back
to the Order of Everlasting.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.314
That's the job he gave me.

23:36.316 --> 23:39.283
And now you're going to do your job.

23:45.191 --> 23:48.926
Or, for every hour the
Reverend is still alive,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.796
I'm going to slice another
inch across her pretty throat.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.332
That give you what,
Davey? Maybe three hours

23:54.334 --> 23:56.601
until I reach her jugular... yeah?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.970
Starting right now!

24:02.609 --> 24:05.676
I'll kill you!

24:05.678 --> 24:07.445
You will not hurt her.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.046
I will.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.982
- Oh, come back, Gracie!
- Stop!

24:16.656 --> 24:19.390
No! Come back Gracie!

24:21.995 --> 24:25.796
Come on! Gracie!

24:25.798 --> 24:27.498
Where you going, girl?

24:38.177 --> 24:41.379
Oh, I'm gonna chop that girl right in half.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.985
Dean!

24:53.560 --> 24:56.027
The flesh is broken, spirit lives.

24:56.029 --> 24:58.829
The flesh is broken, spirit lives.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.831
The flesh is broken, spirit lives.

25:15.375 --> 25:17.074
Gracie!

25:17.076 --> 25:18.376
Oh, my God. They're already here.

25:18.378 --> 25:21.479
Gracie!

25:21.481 --> 25:23.748
Charlotte.

25:23.750 --> 25:27.785
- Maria!
- Gracie!

25:27.787 --> 25:29.487
David! Are you all right?

25:29.489 --> 25:30.988
I took care of it. She's okay.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.557
She's okay!

25:32.559 --> 25:33.724
Thought I'd lost you again. You okay?

25:33.726 --> 25:35.293
- Where are they?
- I took care of it.

25:35.295 --> 25:36.594
I shot that son of a bitch.

25:36.596 --> 25:37.795
- Dean?
- Yeah.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.330
- Where?
- He's in the lake.

25:39.332 --> 25:40.832
Please, let's just get out of here.

25:40.834 --> 25:43.134
No, no we can't leave. Not yet.

25:43.136 --> 25:44.735
The host may be dead, but the demon isn't.

25:44.737 --> 25:46.270
That thing's still out there.

25:46.272 --> 25:48.473
Abigail has to destroy it.

25:48.475 --> 25:50.007
What are you talking about?

25:50.009 --> 25:51.442
Evil.

25:53.246 --> 25:55.980
We gotta go. This'll have to wait.

25:55.982 --> 25:58.683
We gotta go now. Come on, go with David.

25:58.685 --> 26:01.652
Get in the car, sweetheart.

26:01.654 --> 26:03.588
Charlotte, come on.

26:03.590 --> 26:04.956
- Come with me.
- Who are you people?

26:04.958 --> 26:06.657
Come on, Charlotte! Get in the car.

26:11.664 --> 26:13.364
Fun's over, Charlotte!

26:13.366 --> 26:16.601
Your Daddy warned you to stay out of here.

26:16.603 --> 26:18.469
For $500 a week, I don't mind

26:18.471 --> 26:20.505
being Robert's errand boy,

26:20.507 --> 26:21.706
but if I have to keep cleaning up

26:21.708 --> 26:23.508
after Daddy's little girl too,

26:23.510 --> 26:25.643
I'm gonna need a raise.

26:25.645 --> 26:27.278
I'm gonna go check around back.

26:35.555 --> 26:37.321
Hey, Jessie.

26:37.323 --> 26:39.357
Tell your guys they can go
home... finish up tomorrow.

26:39.359 --> 26:40.992
You heard the man. Pack it up, boys.

26:40.994 --> 26:42.560
You need to go get yourself cleaned up.

26:42.562 --> 26:45.396
Don't worry about me. I can handle myself.

26:45.398 --> 26:47.398
We're gonna be okay.

26:51.137 --> 26:52.370
What going on?

26:52.372 --> 26:54.972
The less you know, the better.

26:54.974 --> 26:56.874
Sheriff came by.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.377
They're looking for that guy.

26:59.379 --> 27:01.145
What did he say?

27:01.147 --> 27:04.248
Look, I don't want this
blowing back on you.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.650
Maybe I should just come forward.

27:05.652 --> 27:07.318
No, no. Listen to me.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.754
Nothing's gonna happen. I won't let it.

27:09.756 --> 27:11.556
Excuse me.

27:11.558 --> 27:13.758
Can someone please give me a ride home.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.059
Can... can you?

27:15.061 --> 27:16.327
Yeah.

27:16.329 --> 27:18.596
Come on. I'll give you a lift.

27:42.689 --> 27:43.854
Gracie.

27:43.856 --> 27:46.123
Something's happening to me.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.726
It's okay.

27:48.728 --> 27:50.761
Ah, baby... it's okay.

27:50.763 --> 27:53.798
You're home now.

27:53.800 --> 27:58.302
You're home now. You're safe.

28:03.109 --> 28:08.145
Nowhere is safe anymore.

28:08.147 --> 28:11.582
Come here.

28:16.810 --> 28:19.545
No more hiding. We need
to take the fight to them.

28:19.547 --> 28:21.046
What you need is to calm down.

28:21.048 --> 28:22.915
I'm not afraid of them! I took out Dean!

28:22.917 --> 28:24.550
I can take whatever's next.

28:24.552 --> 28:26.585
Guess maybe I'm more
warrior than you thought.

28:26.587 --> 28:27.987
All you did is kill a host.

28:27.989 --> 28:29.521
It stopped him! Didn't it?

28:29.523 --> 28:31.023
For now, but that demon's still out there

28:31.025 --> 28:32.591
and so's his mother.

28:32.593 --> 28:33.859
Then I'll kill all the Sons if I have to!

28:33.861 --> 28:35.561
Stop! You're not thinking clear.

28:35.563 --> 28:37.029
Get it together!

28:37.031 --> 28:39.031
We can't start taking innocent lives.

28:39.033 --> 28:40.766
Dean and his mother aren't innocent.

28:40.768 --> 28:42.701
They asked for their demons.

28:42.703 --> 28:44.903
But the rest of the Sons
might be under her control...

28:44.905 --> 28:47.406
Same way they used you and Charlotte.

28:47.408 --> 28:49.341
She called mother's milk
a kiss from her veins.

28:49.343 --> 28:51.110
The demon's blood.

28:51.112 --> 28:53.279
That's how they're injecting
her madness into people.

28:53.281 --> 28:56.448
Then we take out Momma
Parsing and this all goes away.

28:56.450 --> 28:58.450
I don't know if Abigail can.

28:58.452 --> 29:01.387
Whatever happens next...

29:01.389 --> 29:03.956
Look, there's something that I need to know

29:03.958 --> 29:07.059
and don't lie to me.

29:07.061 --> 29:10.796
How did Mom really die?

29:10.798 --> 29:12.898
You already know.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.534
Car ran off the road, flipped in the river.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.436
Please, I don't need you to protect me.

29:17.438 --> 29:18.804
I just need to know.

29:18.806 --> 29:21.707
Why are you asking me this now?

29:21.709 --> 29:23.075
When I went back to our old house,

29:23.077 --> 29:24.543
I saw something.

29:31.619 --> 29:33.252
How's Gracie?

29:33.254 --> 29:35.788
She coulda been killed.

29:35.790 --> 29:38.157
Hey... I saved her life.

29:38.159 --> 29:41.060
After you and your girlfriend
led that maniac straight to her.

29:41.062 --> 29:44.229
What is your problem with me?

29:44.231 --> 29:47.433
The rush you're feeling
from pulling that trigger...

29:47.435 --> 29:49.768
That's not real courage.

29:49.770 --> 29:51.236
You know all about that.

29:51.238 --> 29:53.238
Stop it, both of you.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.675
This is exactly what they want;
for us to turn on each other.

29:56.677 --> 29:58.777
We've got bigger problems on the way.

30:03.784 --> 30:06.652
Ms. Roberts!

30:06.654 --> 30:07.920
You out here?

30:07.922 --> 30:09.788
Sheriff?

30:09.790 --> 30:11.490
You oughta come over here.

30:22.370 --> 30:25.170
Drug deal gone bad?

30:25.172 --> 30:27.773
Society of Sons.

30:27.775 --> 30:29.441
That's their uniform.

30:29.443 --> 30:31.176
There's no way I'm sticking my neck out

30:31.178 --> 30:34.847
for Roberts on this one.
Those are real bad people.

30:34.849 --> 30:36.882
Call it in.

30:41.021 --> 30:42.855
The more you care about someone,

30:42.857 --> 30:46.825
the deeper you sink
trying to hold on to them.

30:46.827 --> 30:51.697
It's human nature, not wanting to let go.

30:51.699 --> 30:54.900
Even for the most inhuman of people.

31:00.808 --> 31:02.574
That's him.

31:08.048 --> 31:12.851
Oh, my precious Dean.

31:12.853 --> 31:15.687
What did they do to your beautiful body.

31:20.394 --> 31:22.528
Why is it so hard to let go, Mommy?

31:29.603 --> 31:32.070
It's okay, Dean.

31:32.072 --> 31:34.840
You'll always have a place inside me.

31:58.766 --> 32:00.132
You okay?

32:00.134 --> 32:04.803
Oh, God.

32:04.805 --> 32:07.072
How much do you know about those two?

32:07.074 --> 32:08.907
Not much, I guess.

32:08.909 --> 32:10.576
Do you know what they do?

32:10.578 --> 32:12.444
Try to get by like anyone else.

32:14.548 --> 32:16.248
Not like anybody I know.

32:25.759 --> 32:27.292
Get around, don't you neighbor?

32:29.463 --> 32:32.064
Need to have a word with Ms. Roberts.

32:32.066 --> 32:33.398
Is there a problem, Rick?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.834
That's what we're gonna find out.

32:35.836 --> 32:37.236
Why don't you park yourself over there

32:37.238 --> 32:41.173
- while I talk to the lady.
- Yes, sir.

32:43.777 --> 32:48.747
You're mixed up with some
dangerous people, Ms. Roberts.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.250
This handsome devil was affiliated

32:51.252 --> 32:53.418
with a criminal supremacist group.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.187
Your junky friend and his sister

32:55.189 --> 32:57.656
seem to attract a lot of trouble.

32:57.658 --> 32:59.591
No one wants this to land on you,

32:59.593 --> 33:03.328
but I can't protect you
unless you help me first.

33:03.330 --> 33:05.130
Tell me what happened.

33:05.132 --> 33:06.498
We'll put these people away,
you can go back to your life

33:06.500 --> 33:08.267
bangin' pool boys and giving the help

33:08.269 --> 33:12.204
something to gossip about.

33:12.206 --> 33:13.772
What's it gonna be, Charlotte?

33:25.653 --> 33:26.718
Hey, Rev.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.220
We got company.

33:31.859 --> 33:35.494
Don't make a move 'til I say so.

33:37.031 --> 33:38.330
I'll be right back.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.041
We needa settle this, Bledsoe.

33:49.043 --> 33:53.045
We're giving you a chance
to resolve this peacefully.

33:53.047 --> 33:55.213
Peaceful is what you
call attacking my church

33:55.215 --> 33:57.816
and threatening my family.

33:57.818 --> 34:02.654
Peaceful compared to what's coming next.

34:10.264 --> 34:13.665
See, Dean wanted you dead,

34:13.667 --> 34:16.668
but I'm a different man than he was.

34:16.670 --> 34:19.103
Join us, Reverend.

34:26.746 --> 34:28.447
You're out of your damn mind.

34:28.449 --> 34:30.949
We don't need your life,

34:30.951 --> 34:34.620
just your soul and we'll
leave your daughter be.

34:34.621 --> 34:38.556
Otherwise, we're giving you fair warning.

34:59.686 --> 35:01.153
What are you doing?

35:01.155 --> 35:02.687
You need to take Grace and get out of here

35:02.689 --> 35:04.823
- while you still can!
- I'm not leaving!

35:04.825 --> 35:06.424
I told you. A man can't keep running away.

35:06.426 --> 35:08.593
I can't protect you this time.

35:08.594 --> 35:10.360
I'm not asking for you to!

35:10.370 --> 35:12.364
Elijah, no! Don't do it.

35:12.366 --> 35:13.598
If it'll save Grace.

35:13.600 --> 35:14.900
Are you insane?

35:14.902 --> 35:16.201
Believe me... it won't,

35:16.203 --> 35:18.236
no matter what the devil promises.

35:18.238 --> 35:21.106
My church, my call!

35:24.178 --> 35:27.179
I'll trade my soul for Grace if I have to.

35:36.256 --> 35:37.789
Do we have a deal?

35:48.635 --> 35:50.468
The Rev wants you to stay here.

35:53.774 --> 35:55.907
I stand before you unarmed

35:55.909 --> 35:58.043
and I'm prepared to answer

35:58.045 --> 35:59.945
for the violence of my past.

36:04.051 --> 36:07.118
And show the devil's speech.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.155
You want my soul? Come get it.

36:17.764 --> 36:22.567
You'll have to go through me first.

36:22.569 --> 36:24.669
You gonna kill all of us, Maria?

36:24.671 --> 36:27.439
It doesn't have to be this way.

36:34.414 --> 36:36.948
What the hell?

36:36.950 --> 36:38.583
I didn't know there'd be so many of 'em.

36:38.585 --> 36:39.751
I should be out there with him.

36:39.753 --> 36:40.986
No.

37:01.475 --> 37:03.441
She's here. It's a setup!

37:03.443 --> 37:04.542
Grace!

37:08.382 --> 37:10.115
No need to fear, child.

37:10.117 --> 37:13.785
Old Lanie hurt you...

37:13.787 --> 37:16.121
But I will.

37:16.123 --> 37:17.689
Dean?

37:17.691 --> 37:19.291
Just like I told you, Davey.

37:19.293 --> 37:21.626
We're practically brothers, remember?

37:21.628 --> 37:23.295
Just like family.

37:23.297 --> 37:26.064
And this family always sticks together.

37:26.066 --> 37:29.401
You people think you can
just take my son's life?

37:29.403 --> 37:32.804
And murder my father?

37:32.806 --> 37:34.406
You have to pay!

37:36.810 --> 37:38.310
Let's make her hurt, Mom.

37:38.312 --> 37:40.045
Get away from her!

37:41.181 --> 37:43.381
Daddy!

37:43.383 --> 37:45.517
This looks familiar.

37:45.519 --> 37:47.385
Do you think you're going to protect her

37:47.387 --> 37:50.722
like you did her whore mother?

37:50.724 --> 37:54.526
- She wasn't a whore.
- Stop!

37:54.528 --> 37:57.062
What was that, dear?

37:57.064 --> 37:59.597
I couldn't hear you with all the noise.

38:05.772 --> 38:08.273
Yes, she needs you.

38:11.578 --> 38:13.745
- Maria!
- No, Gracie, come back here!

38:23.557 --> 38:25.957
What's happening?

38:25.959 --> 38:27.459
Who are you?

38:45.779 --> 38:47.112
Aah!

39:10.103 --> 39:13.238
With the mad demon destroyed,
her power over the Sons

39:13.240 --> 39:16.674
faded like a bad dream,
and with nothing else

39:16.676 --> 39:20.278
to control their ignorance and hatred,

39:20.280 --> 39:23.648
the Sons of Society scattered
like the flock of cowards

39:23.650 --> 39:26.818
they really were.

39:26.820 --> 39:29.988
Stay away from me.

39:29.990 --> 39:33.591
If I could bring your
husband back, I would.

39:33.593 --> 39:35.927
I was a different man back then.

39:35.929 --> 39:39.330
Don't you dare try to comfort me.

39:39.332 --> 39:42.500
You took everything from
me. I have nothing left.

39:42.502 --> 39:45.770
Just kill me, too. Please.

39:45.772 --> 39:47.505
I know you want to.

39:47.507 --> 39:49.441
No.

39:49.443 --> 39:51.476
If there's one thing
we can learn from death,

39:51.478 --> 39:53.878
it's the value of our own lives.

39:55.515 --> 39:57.682
I'm very sorry.

40:02.489 --> 40:04.889
What's happening to me?

40:04.891 --> 40:09.861
Whatever it is, hell is
trying awfully hard to stop it.

40:11.465 --> 40:13.832
I just don't know if any of this is real.

40:13.834 --> 40:18.203
Oh, believe me, it's all very real.

40:20.841 --> 40:23.641
I like talking to you, Tetra.

40:23.643 --> 40:25.543
Like the mother I never had.

40:30.550 --> 40:32.250
Can I speak to you outside?

40:34.387 --> 40:35.987
How do you know so much?

40:35.989 --> 40:37.422
Knowledge I've paid a heavy price for.

40:37.424 --> 40:39.858
What was that? What is that power she has?

40:39.860 --> 40:42.494
A power that she must
take after her mother.

40:42.496 --> 40:46.664
She has a spirit inside
her you cannot imagine.

40:46.666 --> 40:48.733
What are you saying?

40:48.735 --> 40:52.704
I'm saying something very dark is coming

40:52.706 --> 40:55.406
and she may be the only
hope we have to stop it.
