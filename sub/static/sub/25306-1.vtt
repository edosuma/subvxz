01:38.309 --> 01:42.877
Patrick had a vague feeling,
something was about to happen.

01:45.444 --> 01:47.074
How could he tell his parents...

01:47.076 --> 01:48.908
that the malevolent things
were all around?

01:48.910 --> 01:52.207
In the ether and in each
speck of dust.

01:52.209 --> 01:54.108
Patrick had always seen these
things...

01:54.110 --> 01:57.908
and always it had seemed that
he alone knew about them.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.007
And so, on the evening
of the seventh day...

02:01.009 --> 02:03.541
he could feel their imminent
arrival.

02:03.543 --> 02:06.475
Something in the breeze
of twilight had whispered...

02:06.477 --> 02:09.374
"It's going to happen tonight".

02:09.376 --> 02:12.875
The following day when his
mother opened the door...

02:12.877 --> 02:16.007
there was absolutely nothing
there.

02:16.009 --> 02:19.108
The trail of Patrick William
Ward's urine...

02:19.110 --> 02:24.910
led to an empty closet bathed in
the darkness of his last night.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.308
The end.

02:27.310 --> 02:30.275
Wow, gosh.

02:30.277 --> 02:31.375
Here we go.

02:31.377 --> 02:33.075
That's one of your best!

02:33.077 --> 02:34.974
Mom, you tell her that every
single time.

02:34.976 --> 02:37.140
Yeah, but this time I mean it.

02:37.142 --> 02:38.275
Really?

02:38.277 --> 02:41.307
I was fascinated, captivated,
scared.

02:41.309 --> 02:42.474
It was like...

02:42.476 --> 02:43.640
- Lovecraft.
- Lovecraft.

02:43.642 --> 02:46.040
- I know, too much like him, huh?
- No.

02:46.042 --> 02:48.508
I haven't completely found
my voice yet.

02:48.510 --> 02:50.208
Hm, yeah, that's what it is.

02:50.210 --> 02:51.308
Vera!

02:51.310 --> 02:52.408
Mom, my sister's a freak.

02:52.410 --> 02:53.941
Something new, please.

02:53.943 --> 02:55.407
No, Beth, honestly,

02:55.409 --> 02:59.008
I can't wrap my mind around how
you spent days writing this...

02:59.010 --> 03:01.140
piece of crap that ends
with piss on the carpet.

03:01.142 --> 03:02.875
You wouldn't understand.

03:02.877 --> 03:04.441
What the hell are your stories
supposed to mean?

03:04.443 --> 03:06.008
They're supposed to be scary.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.007
Oh, scary, what's scary
is having you as a sister...

03:08.009 --> 03:09.277
but, good luck finding
a boyfriend.

03:10.276 --> 03:11.576
I don't speak French!

03:14.910 --> 03:16.308
Keep writing, Beth.

03:16.310 --> 03:17.974
What if I'm not good enough?

03:17.976 --> 03:20.174
You are good enough, Beth.

03:20.176 --> 03:23.242
You're only saying that cause
you're my mom.

03:26.143 --> 03:27.178
What's that?

03:36.976 --> 03:37.977
What the fuck?

03:56.942 --> 03:58.111
Okay, buddy.

04:06.509 --> 04:08.441
No French, Mom.

04:27.910 --> 04:30.141
It's green, everyone likes it.

04:30.143 --> 04:32.574
No, no.

04:32.576 --> 04:36.241
Yeah, it's no problem, yeah.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.810
That's quite the vintage
car you got there.

04:40.143 --> 04:42.041
Mom and I love old things.

04:42.043 --> 04:43.241
You just passing though?

04:43.243 --> 04:44.874
No.

04:44.876 --> 04:46.908
I mean, we're moving here,
into Aunt Clarisse's house.

04:46.910 --> 04:48.875
Aunt Clarisse? She live around
here?

04:48.877 --> 04:50.307
Um, I'm not sure exactly.

04:50.309 --> 04:51.975
I mean, she's dead.

04:51.977 --> 04:54.474
She was my mother's cousin's
sister-in-law, or something.

04:54.476 --> 04:57.275
Ah, Clarisse Jourdan, that
kooky, old French lady...

04:57.277 --> 04:59.573
who had that place way up
in the prair... oh, damn it!

04:59.575 --> 05:01.540
For Christ's sake! It's gonna
smell like nail polish...

05:01.542 --> 05:03.941
in here for at least a week.

05:03.943 --> 05:06.378
Watch the store for a minute,
will ya, Miss... Jourdan.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.911
My name's Keller.

05:52.976 --> 05:54.076
What you doing?

05:56.310 --> 05:57.307
What is that?

05:57.309 --> 05:58.875
A story you wouldn't like.

05:58.877 --> 05:59.811
How would you know?

06:01.475 --> 06:02.943
Is there nobody here?

06:04.276 --> 06:06.074
Oh god, it stinks.

06:06.076 --> 06:07.143
She'll be right back.

06:11.342 --> 06:13.211
My god, I look heinous.

06:15.243 --> 06:17.140
Okay, what's the story about?

06:17.142 --> 06:20.175
Some guy's been breaking into
homes, murdering the parents...

06:20.177 --> 06:24.107
and sparing the daughters,
who are always about your age.

06:24.109 --> 06:26.141
Uh-huh... and?

06:26.143 --> 06:28.373
He stays in the house
with her...

06:28.375 --> 06:30.407
along with the parents' dead
bodies.

06:30.409 --> 06:31.640
Tss, you made that up.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.342
Girls!

06:35.110 --> 06:36.277
Let's go?

06:49.508 --> 06:53.044
Jesus Christ, it's Rob Zombie's
house.

06:54.910 --> 06:56.506
She's gonna like it.

06:56.508 --> 06:58.406
It's not bad.

06:58.408 --> 07:01.874
Yeah, it's an extension
of your brain.

07:01.876 --> 07:03.041
You got to be kidding me.

07:03.043 --> 07:05.040
The bedrooms are upstairs.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.340
Mom, it smells like old
ladies in here.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.108
It smells like mold, Vera.

07:08.110 --> 07:09.944
Yeah, that's what I said.

07:12.308 --> 07:13.540
Look at all these dolls.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.573
Clarissa never
let me play with them.

07:16.575 --> 07:18.876
What was Aunt Clarisse's deal?

07:21.143 --> 07:22.910
- Is it working?
- Nope!

07:26.642 --> 07:29.507
Bingo!

07:29.509 --> 07:34.008
When are you gonna give up this
arty writer bullshit...

07:34.010 --> 07:35.941
and just use a laptop?

07:35.943 --> 07:37.075
Never.

07:37.077 --> 07:39.242
Oh god, it's like
a flea market in here.

07:41.109 --> 07:42.641
Think she bought all these
for herself?

07:42.643 --> 07:44.410
You know, old ladies love
that kind of crap.

07:46.077 --> 07:49.075
- A Chinese puzzle box.
- What?

07:49.077 --> 07:51.274
It's more than a mirror,
it's actually a box.

07:51.276 --> 07:53.406
I've read about these.

07:53.408 --> 07:56.010
There's gotta be a secret button
somewhere.

08:06.609 --> 08:09.443
Jesus!

08:14.909 --> 08:16.811
- So, you like it?
- No.

08:32.643 --> 08:34.506
Vera, careful with that.

08:34.509 --> 08:36.111
Who would even want to
buy something like that?

08:39.610 --> 08:40.510
Honey?

08:43.076 --> 08:45.943
Baby? Beth? Beth...

08:47.542 --> 08:48.810
I'm okay.

08:50.308 --> 08:51.943
Oh, sweetie.

08:53.443 --> 08:57.174
Of course, you're okay.
That's why you look so pale.

08:57.176 --> 09:00.075
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing.

09:00.077 --> 09:03.274
She's like you now.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.174
Great. Well, you know you have
a great sense of timing.

09:06.176 --> 09:07.877
Vera!

09:19.442 --> 09:20.540
Is she alright?

09:20.542 --> 09:22.307
Oh, so now you ask.

09:22.309 --> 09:24.373
You could have stayed
and helped her out.

09:24.375 --> 09:26.976
Why bother, you'd rush and
rescue her anyways.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.908
I just, I don't get why she
would write these stories...

09:31.910 --> 09:33.306
when she falls apart at the
first sight of blood.

09:33.308 --> 09:37.541
Mom, she's afraid of flying,
she's afraid of boys...

09:37.543 --> 09:39.143
she's afraid of her own
freakin' shadow.

09:44.408 --> 09:46.107
The other day when I was
packing...

09:46.109 --> 09:47.441
I found something you'll
never believe.

09:47.443 --> 09:51.474
I'm not into games, Vera.

09:51.476 --> 09:54.241
An interview with her, Mom.

09:54.243 --> 09:57.173
Several pages, all typed up
like it was in a magazine.

09:57.175 --> 09:59.406
She made the whole thing up.

09:59.408 --> 10:02.273
Like, in it, she's some famous
writer and this journalist...

10:02.275 --> 10:04.641
is asking her all these
questions about her books.

10:04.643 --> 10:06.874
She needs a reality check, Mom!

10:06.876 --> 10:11.106
It's nice to know you do love
your sister after all.

10:11.108 --> 10:12.641
I know you're angry about
leaving...

10:12.643 --> 10:14.074
your boyfriend behind, Vera,
but...

10:14.076 --> 10:15.307
Whatever, Mom.

10:15.309 --> 10:16.910
And quit wearing make-up.

10:26.443 --> 10:30.474
Fuck you! Piece of shit!

10:30.476 --> 10:33.176
I know you love her more!

10:36.509 --> 10:39.343
Beth, Beth... fucking Beth.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.142
Shit.

10:55.342 --> 10:56.843
Shit.

11:01.375 --> 11:03.240
Mom!

11:03.242 --> 11:05.474
Where does your antique lamp go?

11:05.476 --> 11:07.207
I'm upstairs!

11:07.209 --> 11:09.608
With you favorite writer,
I know.

11:09.610 --> 11:12.140
Your antique lamp, where
does it go?

11:12.142 --> 11:14.043
In your room.

11:16.075 --> 11:18.975
Did you hear me?

11:18.977 --> 11:20.210
Yes!

11:28.876 --> 11:31.174
Hey, go easy on the door.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.342
Enjoying my bed are you?

11:35.508 --> 11:39.273
This is yours.
Oh, this is yours too.

11:39.275 --> 11:42.075
Your Cthulhu shit is not
staying in my room, take it.

11:44.375 --> 11:45.607
Would it kill you to be...

11:45.609 --> 11:47.273
a little nicer to your sister?

11:47.275 --> 11:49.074
It might.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.576
You are unbearable!

11:52.642 --> 11:54.207
Not mine!

11:59.877 --> 12:02.811
It's an old house.

12:05.877 --> 12:10.241
God, Mom, it's my room!
Go help Lovecraft Junior. Jesus!

12:14.408 --> 12:17.242
<i>Lower!</i>

12:27.375 --> 12:29.409
Shit.

12:33.442 --> 12:35.941
Jane? What?

12:35.943 --> 12:38.075
<i>I can barely hear you. Hello?</i>

12:42.076 --> 12:46.177
Hello? Jane, I can't hear you.

12:51.909 --> 12:53.276
Agh!

13:06.576 --> 13:08.911
Agh!

13:18.909 --> 13:22.377
Mom? Mom!

13:32.376 --> 13:34.107
Agh!

13:34.109 --> 13:36.174
No! No!

15:57.009 --> 15:59.544
They just wanna play with dolls.

16:09.408 --> 16:11.209
Don't look at me.

16:14.876 --> 16:16.309
No!

17:34.542 --> 17:36.939
Listen to me, Beth.

17:36.941 --> 17:41.906
You have to go please, go run
away, baby, run away!

17:43.875 --> 17:45.009
No!

18:07.208 --> 18:09.174
No!

18:09.176 --> 18:11.109
Fucker!

18:43.442 --> 18:44.942
Mom!

18:50.076 --> 18:54.842
Mom! Mom! No, no!

19:00.875 --> 19:02.074
No! No!

19:02.076 --> 19:05.241
Beth, Beth, come here, come
here, baby, baby, come here.

19:05.243 --> 19:07.340
Hey, hey, it's okay, Beth,
it's okay.

19:07.342 --> 19:13.306
You're okay. You're okay, hey.

19:13.308 --> 19:14.509
Oh, god.

19:16.574 --> 19:17.874
I was in the basement.

19:17.876 --> 19:19.507
I know, I know.

19:19.509 --> 19:22.974
- With Vera.
- It's over now, okay?

19:22.976 --> 19:24.107
It was so real.

19:24.109 --> 19:26.277
It was a long time ago, Beth.

19:29.076 --> 19:32.209
Hey. Oh... hey.

19:40.541 --> 19:45.040
<i>It's
a beautiful morning on CO1.</i>

19:45.042 --> 19:49.242
<i>Sit back and enjoy Chicago's
classical music station.</i>

20:32.475 --> 20:34.406
Yeah?

20:34.408 --> 20:35.542
Uh, it's Jerry.

20:37.375 --> 20:38.506
Hey, Jerry...

20:38.508 --> 20:40.207
No, I'm sorry, she can't come
to the phone right now.

20:40.209 --> 20:41.505
<i>I need to talk to her.</i>

20:41.507 --> 20:43.107
Yeah, I'll get her to call you
back right away.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.340
<i>Five times the sales.</i>

20:44.342 --> 20:45.506
Excuse me.

20:45.508 --> 20:47.007
Five times, my friend,
is she writing?

20:47.009 --> 20:49.006
Uh, yeah, no, of course,
she's writing.

20:49.008 --> 20:50.306
<i>We're all
gonna be there tonight.</i>

20:50.308 --> 20:51.973
This is it, does she get it?

20:51.975 --> 20:53.374
I don't know, Jerry. I'll tell
her, she's right here.

20:53.376 --> 20:54.874
I'm gonna tell her right now,
okay?

20:54.876 --> 20:56.207
- <i>Okay, cool.</i>
- Okay, great, thanks.

20:56.209 --> 20:58.373
<i>I'm so fucking happy.</i>

20:58.375 --> 21:01.006
The entire publishing staff
are gonna be at the show.

21:01.008 --> 21:04.173
Your sales are through the roof,
they adore you!

21:04.175 --> 21:06.539
They adore the sales.

21:06.541 --> 21:08.274
Do you want to know?

21:08.276 --> 21:09.639
I hate numbers.

21:09.641 --> 21:12.342
Well, but they're huge.

21:15.976 --> 21:18.040
And they love you.

21:18.042 --> 21:22.374
Yes, hi... no, I just told her!
Okay.

21:22.376 --> 21:25.907
Tonight's guest has been
described as a master of horror.

21:25.909 --> 21:29.174
Her latest book is
"INCIDENT IN A GHOST LAND".

21:29.176 --> 21:30.874
It's only been out two weeks...

21:30.876 --> 21:33.340
and already it's topping the
bestseller lists.

21:33.342 --> 21:35.506
We're very lucky to have her...

21:35.508 --> 21:38.907
as she very rarely makes
television appearances...

21:38.909 --> 21:41.040
Elizabeth Keller!

21:41.042 --> 21:43.307
Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet
you, Elizabeth.

21:43.309 --> 21:45.074
It's a pleasure for me,
too, Eve.

21:45.076 --> 21:46.974
"Incident in a Ghostland"...

21:46.976 --> 21:49.874
is your most personal book
so far...

21:49.876 --> 21:52.140
and a kind of tribute to your
family.

21:52.142 --> 21:54.007
Yes, that's true.

21:54.009 --> 21:58.174
What happened to you and your
sister when you were teenagers?

21:58.176 --> 22:00.874
Oh, are you asking if the book
is autobiographical?

22:00.876 --> 22:04.007
What I'm saying, Elizabeth,
is that it just seems so real.

22:04.009 --> 22:07.406
The details are so intense that
I guess the question is...

22:07.408 --> 22:09.040
why write this book?

22:09.042 --> 22:11.506
To keep from going insane.

22:11.508 --> 22:13.476
Truly?

22:14.642 --> 22:17.540
I mean, is there a better reason
to write?

22:17.542 --> 22:19.040
No.

22:19.042 --> 22:21.173
She just wouldn't shut up
about Vera and I...

22:21.175 --> 22:23.240
I got defensive, I'm sure
everyone noticed.

22:23.242 --> 22:26.505
It's not as bad as that.

22:26.507 --> 22:29.906
You know, in your own mysterious
way, you call the shots.

22:29.908 --> 22:32.106
You're only saying that because
you're my biggest fan.

22:32.108 --> 22:34.575
Shit, you're right.

22:38.442 --> 22:40.539
I'm gonna take Harlequin
up to bed.

22:40.541 --> 22:43.340
Are you sure you wanna watch
this all over again?

22:43.342 --> 22:47.043
Take a note from your son,
look how much he cares.

22:49.176 --> 22:50.940
He's not gonna go to bed
in this, is he?

22:50.942 --> 22:52.372
Why not, he loves this costume?

22:55.507 --> 22:58.943
I told you, they love you!

23:03.475 --> 23:08.042
Hello? Hello?

23:09.175 --> 23:10.940
Hello?

23:10.942 --> 23:13.040
<i>Beth! Please,
you have to come back.</i>

23:13.042 --> 23:14.406
Vera?

23:14.408 --> 23:16.405
<i>Come back! Please...</i>

23:16.407 --> 23:18.339
Is Mom there with you?

23:18.341 --> 23:19.573
<i>They're in the house!</i>

23:19.575 --> 23:21.074
Vera, listen to me.

23:21.076 --> 23:22.305
<i>You're not hearing me, Beth.</i>

23:22.307 --> 23:23.406
I hear you!

23:23.408 --> 23:25.607
<i>Don't leave me alone, Beth.</i>

23:25.609 --> 23:27.107
Is Mom there?

23:27.109 --> 23:28.176
Vera!

23:30.142 --> 23:32.106
Your Mom's with her obviously,
right?

23:32.108 --> 23:34.339
She has to be.

23:34.341 --> 23:36.139
Pick up, Mom, pick up.

23:36.141 --> 23:38.539
It's busy.

23:38.541 --> 23:40.408
Okay. You can just try again.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.406
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

23:50.408 --> 23:52.572
<i>I don't know,
it could be nothing...</i>

23:52.574 --> 23:54.440
<i>just one of Vera's delusions,
but...</i>

23:54.442 --> 23:56.241
<i>Mom isn't answering her
phone...</i>

23:56.243 --> 23:58.240
<i>and I'm having those
dreams again.</i>

23:58.242 --> 23:59.405
<i>Something's not right.</i>

23:59.407 --> 24:00.974
<i>I understand, but...</i>

24:00.976 --> 24:02.406
<i>They never should have
stayed in that house.</i>

24:02.408 --> 24:03.939
<i>It's not helping Vera.</i>

24:03.941 --> 24:05.572
<i>She should be in a hospital.</i>

24:05.574 --> 24:08.440
<i>All right.
Call us when you get there.</i>

24:08.442 --> 24:09.606
<i>I will.</i>

24:09.608 --> 24:12.040
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

24:35.242 --> 24:37.074
Here? Are you sure?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.241
Yes.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.542
Mom?

25:03.141 --> 25:04.341
Mom!

25:09.875 --> 25:11.142
Mom?

25:12.574 --> 25:14.208
Beth?

25:15.407 --> 25:18.341
Oh, baby doll! What are you
doing here?

25:20.207 --> 25:22.040
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

25:22.042 --> 25:23.472
Vera called last night.

25:23.474 --> 25:25.472
She was screaming in the phone
and then it got disconnected.

25:25.474 --> 25:28.006
I tried calling back, but I
couldn't get through.

25:28.008 --> 25:29.505
And I didn't know what
was happening.

25:29.507 --> 25:31.240
I didn't know she used
the phone.

25:31.242 --> 25:33.876
- Everything's okay?
- Yeah, she's resting.

25:35.174 --> 25:38.505
I've missed you so much!

25:38.507 --> 25:40.406
You look beautiful.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.205
You haven't changed at all.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.010
Oh well!

26:12.174 --> 26:14.342
House looks exactly the same,
Mom.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.073
After all these years...

26:18.075 --> 26:19.874
you're still living in old
Clarisse's style.

26:19.876 --> 26:21.205
Unfair.

26:21.207 --> 26:23.873
I sold most of it.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.206
Yeah?

26:25.208 --> 26:28.073
You'd never believe what I got
for the antique toys.

26:28.075 --> 26:29.405
Really?

26:29.407 --> 26:34.873
And, I'm going to be able
to redo the whole house.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.639
Mom, haven't you been getting
the money I send you?

26:36.641 --> 26:38.075
Sure I have.

26:41.009 --> 26:44.876
Oh, Beth, I didn't mean
it like that.

26:46.140 --> 26:49.272
Mom, if it's not enough,
just tell me.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.940
I don't even know why
I said that.

26:51.942 --> 26:53.340
You're already spoiling me!

26:53.342 --> 26:56.043
I'm your daughter, I can do it,
I'm not spoiling you, I...

26:57.308 --> 26:58.539
Oh, sweetie.

26:58.541 --> 27:00.874
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I overreacted.

27:00.876 --> 27:02.809
Beth...

27:04.374 --> 27:05.639
You're not mad at me?

27:05.641 --> 27:07.306
Why would I be mad?

27:07.308 --> 27:10.339
Because I left you here
all alone with Vera and...

27:10.341 --> 27:12.105
Beth, look at me.

27:12.107 --> 27:14.040
You didn't abandon me.

27:14.042 --> 27:16.306
You left because you had your
own life to live.

27:16.308 --> 27:18.606
That's perfectly natural.
Understood?

27:18.608 --> 27:21.975
Now dry those tears,
that's my girl.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.010
Let's have a toast!

27:37.942 --> 27:41.075
Since when did you start
drinking redneck beer?

27:52.008 --> 27:55.173
Shit.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.105
The key above the door.

27:57.107 --> 27:58.273
You lock her in?

27:58.275 --> 28:00.206
No, honey, she does.

28:00.208 --> 28:03.272
She hides the key down there.

28:03.274 --> 28:04.909
I made a copy.

28:06.642 --> 28:13.439
Vera! Sweetie! Are you hiding?

28:13.441 --> 28:15.074
Vera?

28:19.141 --> 28:22.042
The first-aid kit, Beth, in the
wardrobe to your left.

28:23.574 --> 28:26.242
Vera, where are you?

28:27.541 --> 28:31.342
Honey? The first aid kit, Beth!

28:37.342 --> 28:39.105
Help me!

28:39.107 --> 28:41.441
Vera! Mom!

28:42.976 --> 28:44.573
Grab her legs, hurry up!

28:44.575 --> 28:45.972
No!

28:45.974 --> 28:48.939
Beth! Move... grab her legs!

28:48.941 --> 28:50.342
It's okay.

28:52.609 --> 28:54.240
No!

28:54.242 --> 28:57.441
Ssh, it's okay, it's okay,
get in the room.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.138
Help me!

29:03.140 --> 29:06.405
Calm down, Vera,
it's okay, calm down.

29:06.407 --> 29:08.273
Help me!

29:08.275 --> 29:10.376
Calm down. Get the key, Beth.

29:12.007 --> 29:17.038
Look at me. It's over,
babe. It's over....

29:17.040 --> 29:20.406
there you go, it's over.

29:20.408 --> 29:23.173
Never again... hurt me.

29:23.175 --> 29:24.306
No one's going to hurt you,
honey.

29:24.308 --> 29:25.506
My sister.

29:25.508 --> 29:27.242
Ssh...

29:29.574 --> 29:31.906
Beth...

29:31.908 --> 29:34.405
I'm here, Vera.

29:34.407 --> 29:35.973
She sees you.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.876
- Vera...
- She sees you.

29:48.609 --> 29:51.173
<i>Please tell me how you got the
inspiration for this book?</i>

29:51.175 --> 29:52.874
<i>Sure, yeah, it all started...</i>

29:52.876 --> 29:55.340
<i>when I was doing my masters
degree at the Sorbone...</i>

29:55.342 --> 29:57.873
<i>and I went to galleries
in Paris...</i>

30:06.975 --> 30:08.442
Come here.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.573
<i>And I went in
and saw a bunch...</i>

30:11.575 --> 30:14.073
<i>of what seemed like outsider
art, it was bizarre...</i>

30:14.075 --> 30:16.141
<i>it was kind of off-kilter.</i>

30:23.342 --> 30:25.309
It's tough, isn't it?

30:26.441 --> 30:27.874
I know.

30:39.941 --> 30:41.476
How do you do it, Mom?

30:44.007 --> 30:46.305
Last week I found her
in my room...

30:46.307 --> 30:49.472
tied to the radiator.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.373
She was screaming like...

30:51.375 --> 30:56.309
I had to turn around to make
sure no one was there.

30:58.308 --> 30:59.409
What can I do?

31:00.974 --> 31:03.308
There's nothing you can do,
Beth.

31:06.609 --> 31:09.509
She keeps reliving that night,
over and over.

31:11.874 --> 31:13.308
Come here.

31:22.174 --> 31:24.208
It's okay.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.975
Help me!

33:29.074 --> 33:30.809
Vera?

33:53.875 --> 33:56.308
Are you gonna let me die alone?

33:57.874 --> 34:01.539
No, not alone?

34:01.541 --> 34:03.475
You're not going to die, Vera.

34:10.206 --> 34:14.371
They're making me pay,
and you're not there.

34:14.373 --> 34:18.438
I move, and they burn me.

34:18.440 --> 34:23.842
I scream and they...
please, please!

34:26.407 --> 34:30.039
I'm begging you, please tell
them...

34:30.041 --> 34:32.038
tell them I'm not a bad girl.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.272
Vera, Vera listen to me, okay?

34:34.274 --> 34:35.973
And I'm sorry if I offended
them!

34:35.975 --> 34:38.572
Tell them to stop punishing me.

34:38.574 --> 34:40.572
You didn't do anything wrong.

34:40.574 --> 34:42.405
- Tell them...
- It's not your fault.

34:42.407 --> 34:45.638
It's not your fault, okay?

34:47.639 --> 34:51.273
- They're here.
- Vera, it's just Mom, Vera...

34:51.275 --> 34:53.342
Vera!

34:56.608 --> 35:00.476
The truck! Oh god.

35:03.475 --> 35:04.808
The truck.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.275
Mom?

35:57.207 --> 35:59.138
Get lost!

35:59.140 --> 36:01.205
Up already, sweetie?

36:01.207 --> 36:02.441
Yeah.

36:04.008 --> 36:06.473
Did Eugene come?

36:06.475 --> 36:10.105
So much crap in this house.

36:10.107 --> 36:12.939
Did he leave you the bill?

36:12.941 --> 36:14.342
Oh, I didn't even see him.

36:19.008 --> 36:21.176
<i>What a great day
for a picnic.</i>

36:46.374 --> 36:50.072
Mm, you still smell like Beth.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.972
That smell drove me crazy.

36:52.974 --> 36:54.973
What are you talking about?

36:54.975 --> 36:58.340
I should have eaten you up,
you and Vera.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.572
So you'd never leave me.

37:00.574 --> 37:04.205
So no boys could ever come
near my girls.

37:04.207 --> 37:06.872
Stop drinking, Mom.

37:06.874 --> 37:09.305
The flesh of my daughters.

37:09.307 --> 37:12.109
You're not making any sense.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.873
Are you okay, Mom?

37:18.875 --> 37:21.242
God, I look like shit.

37:24.441 --> 37:27.638
I don't know where your talent
comes from, honey.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.275
Your capacity to create
your own worlds.

37:41.474 --> 37:43.571
Does it still hurt?

37:43.573 --> 37:46.375
Nothing hurts for real anymore.

37:49.975 --> 37:52.405
You're still pretty, Mom.

37:52.407 --> 37:55.105
What I'm trying to say
is that...

37:55.107 --> 37:59.908
Incident in a Ghost Land
is your best novel yet.

38:01.141 --> 38:03.273
You read it?

38:03.275 --> 38:05.173
Of course, I did...

38:05.175 --> 38:10.005
and it was so good that it
completely rattled me.

38:10.007 --> 38:13.873
I didn't send the book
because...

38:13.875 --> 38:15.405
You're better
than Lovecraft!

38:17.573 --> 38:20.008
Beth, I miss you.

38:22.107 --> 38:25.841
Leave me... all alone.

39:39.573 --> 39:41.308
Vera!

39:43.940 --> 39:49.038
Vera, it's okay. It's okay.

39:49.040 --> 39:54.039
Vera, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

39:54.041 --> 39:57.273
Vera, what did you do?

39:57.275 --> 39:58.972
Vera, look at me.

40:00.507 --> 40:03.375
Vera, nobody's here.
No one is here, Vera!

40:05.540 --> 40:07.440
Where's the key?

40:18.940 --> 40:20.905
No!

40:20.907 --> 40:22.909
No, no, no, no, no...

40:28.374 --> 40:30.438
Vera, Vera, Vera!

40:30.440 --> 40:32.206
Listen to me, please open
the door.

40:33.374 --> 40:34.909
Stop it!

40:39.573 --> 40:42.239
Vera! Open the door!

40:42.241 --> 40:43.271
Vera, please!

40:52.406 --> 40:54.041
Vera?

41:10.373 --> 41:11.374
Agh!

41:27.008 --> 41:28.173
Mom!

41:40.573 --> 41:43.505
Mom, Mom, where's the key?
Vera's having a fit!

41:43.507 --> 41:46.005
She's locked herself in her
room! Where's the bedroom key?

41:46.007 --> 41:48.371
The bedroom key, where
is the bedroom key?

41:48.373 --> 41:50.507
There's no key, honey.

41:51.541 --> 41:54.006
Stop! I hate you!

41:54.008 --> 41:55.875
Vera?

41:57.341 --> 42:00.109
Vera?

42:03.440 --> 42:05.075
Agh!

42:10.041 --> 42:16.372
Get off me, you motherfucker!
Agh!

42:16.374 --> 42:18.942
Fucking asshole!

42:29.874 --> 42:34.374
Vera? Vera?

42:39.139 --> 42:40.538
Mom, call an ambulance!

42:40.540 --> 42:42.808
Vera!

42:44.341 --> 42:48.909
Vera? Wait, stay! Stay okay?

42:56.173 --> 43:00.474
Okay! It's okay, it's okay.
Here you go, here you go.

43:01.608 --> 43:03.575
The ambulance is on its way!

43:06.406 --> 43:09.005
I know why you did that.

43:09.007 --> 43:12.075
I know what you want
from your sister.

43:14.007 --> 43:16.271
I'll wait for them on the road.

43:16.273 --> 43:18.072
Otherwise they'll miss
the trail.

43:18.074 --> 43:19.905
Mom?

43:19.907 --> 43:21.974
Stay with her, and wait for me.

43:23.907 --> 43:26.605
Mom, what did you mean
back there?

43:26.607 --> 43:29.008
Don't listen to her, Beth.

43:58.374 --> 44:01.238
Vera? Vera?

44:01.240 --> 44:04.471
Vera, stay with me!
Stay with me, Vera!

44:04.473 --> 44:06.808
Vera! Stay with me.

44:09.941 --> 44:13.875
Vera... Vera?

44:16.506 --> 44:18.374
I can hear you.

44:20.741 --> 44:24.239
Oh, Vera, I can hear you.
Vera, please stay with me.

44:24.241 --> 44:28.006
Please, Vera. Vera?

44:30.039 --> 44:31.874
Vera?

44:32.907 --> 44:39.204
We broke your sister...

44:39.206 --> 44:41.574
and now, it's your turn.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.341
Mom?

47:10.441 --> 47:14.275
Mom! Mom?

47:16.907 --> 47:18.241
Mom?

47:24.307 --> 47:25.842
Mom!

48:31.574 --> 48:33.108
Vera?

48:53.973 --> 48:57.140
What did you do to me?

48:58.873 --> 49:01.174
Do you understand now, Beth?

49:02.940 --> 49:06.339
Vera, what'd you do to me?

49:06.341 --> 49:09.171
They broke me and now they're
playing with you.

49:09.173 --> 49:10.471
Vera...

49:10.473 --> 49:11.871
He chose you, Beth.

49:11.873 --> 49:13.205
You psycho!

49:13.207 --> 49:15.004
- Stop it!
- Tell me what you did!

49:15.006 --> 49:16.505
- It's not me!
- Tell me!

49:16.507 --> 49:20.275
Stop it, Beth! Wake up, Beth!

49:22.207 --> 49:25.606
For once in your life,
stop running away!

49:25.608 --> 49:28.575
Try to accept reality!
Come back!

49:33.207 --> 49:35.941
Beth, you're still here.

49:43.641 --> 49:48.471
Beth, listen to me...
accept what happened...

49:48.473 --> 49:51.474
you just need to face the truth.

49:53.374 --> 49:54.472
Mom.

49:54.474 --> 49:56.371
There was nothing she could do.

49:56.373 --> 49:58.440
No, no, no, no...

49:59.939 --> 50:01.440
No!

50:04.240 --> 50:05.937
Mom died, Beth.

50:05.939 --> 50:09.940
- No.
- Yes, she did, she died.

50:15.940 --> 50:18.940
They killed her, Beth.
She died.

50:21.241 --> 50:23.507
I'm so sorry.

50:24.940 --> 50:30.241
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy...

50:32.074 --> 50:34.240
Ssh... she died, Beth.

50:36.973 --> 50:39.040
You have to let her go.

50:44.441 --> 50:46.475
Ssh, Beth...

50:49.374 --> 50:51.241
It's just us.

50:57.939 --> 51:00.274
It's just us, now.

51:24.373 --> 51:26.440
Are you back?

51:28.139 --> 51:31.274
Beth, are you back?

51:49.106 --> 51:51.374
You were talking to them
like they were real.

51:54.374 --> 51:59.971
And to Mom, you looked at me
like I was crazy!

51:59.973 --> 52:05.041
You couldn't hear me.
You were gone.

52:07.140 --> 52:09.375
I didn't know how to bring
you back.

52:56.073 --> 52:58.274
I hate you, Vera!

53:03.207 --> 53:07.471
I hate you, Vera!
I hate you, Vera!

53:07.473 --> 53:10.305
I hate you!

54:05.374 --> 54:08.374
Get up, get up, now, now!
We have to hide!

54:09.640 --> 54:13.338
Ssh... in here!

54:13.340 --> 54:15.405
It's a game, okay?
She wants us to hide!

54:17.039 --> 54:22.172
Listen to me, if she takes
you upstairs, you don't move.

54:22.174 --> 54:24.104
And you don't cry, okay?

54:24.106 --> 54:27.071
No matter... no matter
what he does to you.

54:27.073 --> 54:29.239
He'll go easier, okay?

54:31.306 --> 54:33.538
Last time I hit him in the leg,
he hurt me much worse.

54:33.540 --> 54:35.440
Don't do it.

58:18.406 --> 58:20.605
<i>Listen to me...</i>

58:20.607 --> 58:23.904
<i>if she takes you upstairs...</i>

58:23.906 --> 58:29.808
<i>no matter what he does,
you don't move, and don't cry.</i>

59:39.173 --> 59:41.072
<i>You're pretty.
Will you be my friend?</i>

59:41.074 --> 59:45.136
<i>You're pretty.
Will you be my friend?</i>

59:45.138 --> 59:48.873
<i>Do you want to be friends?
I like you.</i>

59:52.172 --> 59:57.339
<i>I like you. You're pretty.
Will you be my friend?</i>

01:01:54.139 --> 01:01:55.307
No!

01:02:53.305 --> 01:02:55.106
Agh!

01:03:01.505 --> 01:03:05.070
<i>I love you. You're pretty.</i>

01:03:07.938 --> 01:03:10.371
<i>Nobody loves you.
You're ugly.</i>

01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:15.170
<i>You're a fucking pig!
You're a fucking pig!</i>

01:03:15.172 --> 01:03:19.239
<i>I'm going to kill you.
I'm going to kill you.</i>

01:03:20.972 --> 01:03:24.406
<i>Nobody loves you.
Nobody loves you.</i>

01:03:27.439 --> 01:03:29.403
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

01:03:29.405 --> 01:03:31.840
Agh!

01:05:16.439 --> 01:05:18.173
No!

01:09:12.406 --> 01:09:13.903
Vera!

01:09:17.206 --> 01:09:18.439
Vera!

01:09:21.005 --> 01:09:22.372
Ssh!

01:09:32.038 --> 01:09:34.274
Ssh!

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.470
Ssh... in here.

01:09:38.471 --> 01:09:44.872
At that door, one two, three.

01:11:47.639 --> 01:11:51.004
No! No! Wait!

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:54.539
Wait!

01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:59.037
Wait!

01:12:19.305 --> 01:12:22.238
Hang in there, okay?
We're here to help.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.003
- Easy, easy.
- Don't you fucking touch her!

01:12:25.005 --> 01:12:26.402
Don't you come any closer.

01:12:26.404 --> 01:12:28.939
Back off! Back off!
Back the fuck off!

01:12:30.504 --> 01:12:32.402
Okay.

01:12:32.404 --> 01:12:33.904
You're doing really good, girls.

01:12:33.906 --> 01:12:36.373
- Don't you fucking...
- I promise.

01:12:43.905 --> 01:12:46.337
Patrol 10 to dispatch.
I've got a situation here.

01:12:46.339 --> 01:12:48.437
Tell me who did this to you?

01:12:48.439 --> 01:12:51.936
A witch, and an ogre.

01:12:51.938 --> 01:12:55.103
They came for us, at Aunt
Clarisse's.

01:12:55.105 --> 01:12:57.603
About 14, 15, slender...

01:12:57.605 --> 01:13:00.369
one's blonde, the other
brunette. Over.

01:13:00.371 --> 01:13:05.369
It was two fucking men...
in a candy truck.

01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:06.536
A candy truck?

01:13:06.538 --> 01:13:07.870
<i>You read me?</i>

01:13:07.872 --> 01:13:09.271
I read you, John.

01:13:09.273 --> 01:13:10.470
<i>I'm at the gas station.</i>

01:13:10.472 --> 01:13:12.337
<i>Janet says she saw the girls
you described!</i>

01:13:12.339 --> 01:13:14.302
Are you kidding me?

01:13:14.304 --> 01:13:16.237
I swear to God!

01:13:16.239 --> 01:13:18.569
Hold on, can you tell me
where Aunt Clarisse lives?

01:13:18.571 --> 01:13:20.071
<i>Janet said they were going...</i>

01:13:20.073 --> 01:13:21.271
<i>to Clarisse Jourdan's
old house...</i>

01:13:21.273 --> 01:13:22.604
<i>at the corner of Holly Flowers
and Jackson.</i>

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:23.637
I know the place.

01:13:23.639 --> 01:13:25.170
<i>They were with their mother.</i>

01:13:25.172 --> 01:13:26.337
<i>Janet talked to one
of the girls.</i>

01:13:26.339 --> 01:13:27.436
<i>She's sure they're the ones.</i>

01:13:27.438 --> 01:13:29.937
For Christ's sake, John,
send a team!

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:32.336
We'll stop at the hospital
and head straight over!

01:13:32.338 --> 01:13:34.338
<i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

01:13:38.905 --> 01:13:42.270
Cooper! I got some info!

01:13:42.272 --> 01:13:45.604
We have to go! I know where
the girls come from.

01:14:47.238 --> 01:14:52.569
Beth! Beth! Look at me!

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:55.203
Come back!

01:14:55.205 --> 01:14:58.104
Beth!

01:14:58.106 --> 01:15:01.840
Why? No!

01:15:20.404 --> 01:15:21.972
No!

01:15:24.405 --> 01:15:26.140
Beth!

01:16:06.305 --> 01:16:07.637
You look wonderful as always.

01:16:07.639 --> 01:16:09.970
Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.

01:16:09.972 --> 01:16:11.469
- Thanks for the invitation.
- Of course, enjoy.

01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:12.473
I will.

01:16:19.305 --> 01:16:21.103
You look beautiful.

01:16:21.105 --> 01:16:24.036
You, too. Your world is
perfect, honey.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:29.039
A most beautiful dream in a most
beautiful world.

01:16:31.905 --> 01:16:33.036
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:33.038 --> 01:16:34.503
James, this is my mother.

01:16:34.505 --> 01:16:36.871
Pleased to meet you.

01:16:36.873 --> 01:16:39.436
Do you think I could steal her
away for a minute?

01:16:39.438 --> 01:16:40.937
Yes.

01:16:40.939 --> 01:16:43.073
Right this way.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:52.872
Thank you.

01:16:56.104 --> 01:16:58.338
See where Mom is? Wave to Mom.

01:17:20.405 --> 01:17:22.840
It's not really your scene,
is it?

01:17:26.038 --> 01:17:28.871
Not exactly, no.

01:17:28.873 --> 01:17:30.903
I figured as much.

01:17:30.905 --> 01:17:34.903
Even less so when I have
just finished reading.

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:37.136
Oh god.

01:17:37.138 --> 01:17:38.903
What?

01:17:38.905 --> 01:17:43.202
Uh, I have waited my entire life
for this moment...

01:17:43.204 --> 01:17:44.937
and now it's finally arrived...

01:17:44.939 --> 01:17:48.202
and I would rather die
than hear you say that...

01:17:48.204 --> 01:17:52.007
Your novel is a masterpiece.

01:17:54.238 --> 01:17:55.436
What?

01:17:55.438 --> 01:17:57.370
You heard me perfectly.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:18:01.003
If you change even one word
in that book...

01:18:01.005 --> 01:18:04.373
I will never speak to you again.

01:18:09.438 --> 01:18:12.637
Thank you... thank you.

01:18:12.639 --> 01:18:15.070
I mean...

01:18:15.072 --> 01:18:18.069
Thank you so much,
Mr. Lovecraft.

01:18:18.071 --> 01:18:19.506
Howard.

01:18:53.272 --> 01:18:56.373
Help me!

01:19:01.906 --> 01:19:03.306
Vera!

01:19:05.639 --> 01:19:08.570
Don't listen to her, Beth.

01:19:08.572 --> 01:19:10.369
There's nothing left for you
there.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.303
Beth!

01:19:13.305 --> 01:19:16.237
She's my sister, Mom.

01:19:16.239 --> 01:19:19.436
Her world is an ugly place
to be, honey.

01:19:19.438 --> 01:19:22.139
But she's still my sister.

01:19:24.504 --> 01:19:26.269
You sure you wanna do that?

01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:29.935
Beth!

01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:32.337
Yes.

01:19:32.339 --> 01:19:33.540
Go, baby.

01:19:38.137 --> 01:19:39.472
Go.

01:20:34.505 --> 01:20:35.840
Agh!

01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:44.506
Help! Help me!

01:21:22.305 --> 01:21:24.035
Agh!

01:21:30.038 --> 01:21:33.470
No!

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:36.306
Don't move. Step away.

01:21:38.272 --> 01:21:40.540
Hands up! Slow...

01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:45.540
Do it now. Hands up!

01:21:51.171 --> 01:21:53.573
Don't fucking move!

01:21:56.606 --> 01:21:58.338
Don't.

01:24:04.404 --> 01:24:06.306
I love you.

01:25:01.505 --> 01:25:05.569
Okay, Beth, we're about 30 or 40
minutes from the hospital.

01:25:05.571 --> 01:25:10.906
I'm afraid until then,
you're stuck with me.

01:25:14.137 --> 01:25:18.902
You're very strong, you know?
You're very brave.

01:25:18.904 --> 01:25:22.103
I bet you like to play sports.
Do you play sports, Beth?

01:25:22.105 --> 01:25:23.602
No.

01:25:23.604 --> 01:25:27.205
No? Well, I would've lost
that bet.

01:25:29.072 --> 01:25:30.540
I like to write stories.
