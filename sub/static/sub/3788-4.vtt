(PHONE RINGING)

01:17.494 --> 01:20.747
- Yeah?
- It's game day, baby. Wake the fuck up.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.039
- What?
- We're opening today.

01:22.124 --> 01:25.334
We got hot little teens walking into theaters
on the East Coast

01:25.419 --> 01:27.545
to support our boy. Why aren't you awake?

01:27.629 --> 01:28.629
What time is it?

01:28.714 --> 01:31.632
It's time for you to wake up.
I've already shot a 72, bitch.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.177
- What, on the front nine?
- Yeah, that's funny, cunty.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.680
I'll call you with the midday numbers,
get ready. That's not a gimme.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.435
(PHONE RINGING)

01:43.896 --> 01:46.147
- What?
- It's Emily.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.733
I'm headed up your block. Open up the gate.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.360
- ERIC: You're coming here?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.803
- Big day.
- Yeah.

02:16.970 --> 02:21.098
Ari's freaking.
He gets crazy before a client's movie opens.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.227
- Fan mail.
- Oh, thanks.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.439
- What about you? Are you nervous?
- Yeah. A little bit.

02:28.524 --> 02:29.816
I called the psychic hotline.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.027
They said Vince's moons were all aligned.
We're looking pretty good.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.823
- What did they say about your moons?
- I don't know, I was too cheap to ask.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.158
Do you guys have any big plans for tonight?

02:39.243 --> 02:40.701
We're not gonna do anything.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.621
Vince doesn't want to make a big deal
about it. We'll lay low.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.122
That is way too normal.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.374
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.335
- Ari has clients who do crazy stuff.
- Like what?

02:49.419 --> 02:52.171
One of them bought
$3 million worth of tickets

02:52.256 --> 02:54.423
just to make sure
his movie opened at number one.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.842
- Come on.
- I swear.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.009
- Who was it?
- I can't tell.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.594
- Yes, you can. Tell me.
- Mmm-mmm.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.805
He was in Ocean's Eleven.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.809
(LAUGHING)

03:06.228 --> 03:08.437
All right, good luck.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.106
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.774
- Bye.
- See you.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.654
- Um, Eric?
- Yeah?

03:17.739 --> 03:20.449
Since you don't have any plans tonight,

03:21.577 --> 03:24.120
would you maybe want
to go to dinner with me?

03:24.955 --> 03:26.789
Are you asking me out?

03:27.583 --> 03:30.626
I could've sent a messenger with that stuff.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.968
Morning, guys. Fan mail.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.470
What the fuck you smiling about?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.222
Who's smiling, douche bag?

03:43.307 --> 03:45.850
Big night tonight, Vince.
I feel good about it, I do.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.476
Yeah? That's good.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.813
- Anybody know how to work this thing?
- No. Just Johnny.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.524
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs. He got a girl.

03:53.859 --> 03:54.901
Really? Who?

03:54.985 --> 03:58.112
I don't know. He must've ordered
in late night. Woke me up at 4:30.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.031
Sounded like a couple of baboons fucking.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.284
Yeah, he better hurry up, too,
'cause I'm getting hungry.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.621
Aw, picture request.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.332
Nice enough to send
the money for the stamp.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.210
Relax. I'll send the picture.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.466
- Oh, fuck me.
- Let me see.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.888
(WHISTLING)

04:23.972 --> 04:25.514
ERIC: Look at that.
VINCE: Not bad.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.351
- Not bad? She's on fire.
- Let me see this.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.353
"Vincent.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.605
"I believe we were together in a past life.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.274
"I believe we were destined
to be together in this one."

04:35.359 --> 04:37.109
You should call her, Vince. It's destiny.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.071
- Besides, she's got a great ass.
- That's a great idea, Turtle.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.614
Have her catch a ride out here

04:41.698 --> 04:44.659
with the Kevorkian guy from Michigan
who wants Vince to kill him.

04:44.743 --> 04:49.372
He's right. We don't need another psycho.
Look, better keep this, just in case.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.167
Tanya, this is my brother, Vince.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.504
- Good luck tonight.
- Yeah. Me and him, both.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.632
See? These are the other guys.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.008
What's up, guys?

05:01.093 --> 05:04.387
- DRAMA: Want a creatine shake?
- No, I got a case of LUNAbars in the car.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.557
- Show the guys.
- Stop it.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.185
Come on, baby, just once.
Show the guys, please?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.480
What's up, body?

05:14.564 --> 05:17.566
Look at these pythons.
She'll whip all your asses.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.070
- ERIC: True.
- Come on, baby. I'll walk you out.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.871
Shh.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.749
Give me a call.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.960
(GRUNTING)

05:36.044 --> 05:37.420
(CHUCKLING)

05:42.759 --> 05:43.718
What?

05:43.802 --> 05:46.762
Where'd you meet her, Drama?
Barry Bonds hearing?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.140
Please. Tanya's all natural.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.267
I met her at the Vitamin Expo.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.270
- She's booming, huh, Vince?
- She's got a pretty face.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.272
DRAMA: She gave me the ride of my life.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.358
I just hung onto those lats
and surrendered all control.

05:59.943 --> 06:04.864
You know, if I was holding onto those lats,
I'd think I was fucking Evander Holyfield.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.033
(ALL LAUGHING)

06:07.117 --> 06:08.159
Fuck you guys.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.787
I ain't cooking shit for any of you.
Let's see what you do about that.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.128
We should hit Encino first.
It's playing at the Galleria at 6: 15.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.714
Check out the Valley girls.
Then we head over the hill.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.798
Good call.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.634
I don't want to see the movie.
I can't watch myself again.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.053
I love watching myself.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.471
Too bad the audience doesn't.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.889
(ALL LAUGHING)

06:29.973 --> 06:31.849
Vince, you gotta see it with live crowd.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.602
Especially the midnight show
at the Westwood Mann.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.103
It's all hot UCLA ass.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.898
- I don't know. What do you think, E?
- I don't know.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.108
I didn't know
we were thinking about doing this.

06:41.193 --> 06:44.070
- What's to think about?
- I made plans.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.697
(LAUGHING)

06:46.782 --> 06:49.075
On the night my movie's opening
you made plans?

06:49.159 --> 06:51.702
- DRAMA: Bullshit.
- You said you didn't want to think about it.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.704
I didn't want to think about it together.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.998
- What kind of plans did you make?
- Nothing.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.666
I have a date.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.293
(MUSIC PLAYING)

07:01.004 --> 07:02.254
You have a date?

07:02.339 --> 07:04.882
Yeah. Emily asked me to go to dinner.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.761
- She asked you?
- Yeah. It's no big deal.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.972
He's fucking a guy.
You're getting asked out like a little bitch.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.849
I'd say it's a very big deal.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.477
- TouchÃ©.
- Thank you.

07:16.812 --> 07:17.937
Douche bag.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.272
VINCE: I haven't been on
a real date since high school.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.317
That's because nobody dates in L.A., Vince.
It's a waste of time.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.737
- And money.
- L.A. Lives between 2:00 a.m. And 5:00 a.m.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.782
You take a lap through the talent pool.
Catch and release.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.866
Online's even better.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.703
You get the small talk out of the way
so when they show up, they're good to go.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.956
Name one girl
you ever pulled off the Internet.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.625
There are confidentiality agreements
with these sites.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.709
I ain't telling you shit.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.046
- Why don't we all grab dates tonight?
- No, don't grab anybody.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.966
- You can bring Tanya.
- You guys aren't coming with me.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.593
It's opening night, it's a work night.
I need you.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.470
- Fuck that, man.
- Come on, I'm serious.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.973
No, you're not.
I want to get to know this girl.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.100
- Will you give me a fucking break?
- So do we.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.977
Make sure you don't get another lemon.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.688
Just relax. It's not such a big deal.
It'll be fun.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.108
- It'll be like prom.
- I guess you won't have a date then.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.278
I told you 10,000 fucking times.
She had food poisoning.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.487
ERIC: Yeah, right.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.447
BIG BOY ON RADIO:
Power 106, blazing hip hop and R&B.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.866
Big Boy's neighborhood...

08:11.950 --> 08:15.035
Fuzzy Fantabulous, Joe Grande,
Luscious Liz, up in here...

08:15.120 --> 08:16.162
but you know what?

08:16.246 --> 08:18.539
- We're not alone.
- No, not at all.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.042
Vincent Chase is in the house.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.169
(ALL CHEERING)

08:23.253 --> 08:24.503
Head On. That's the movie.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.006
We've been hearing
some beautiful things about this.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.383
When it comes to
an opening weekend for you,

08:29.467 --> 08:32.178
do you have those rituals
that everybody else go through,

08:32.261 --> 08:35.681
like, you got to pack dirt on your face
or sacrifice a goldfish?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.140
No, I'm not superstitious.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.308
- At all?
- No.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.602
I heard

08:39.686 --> 08:43.230
that Mel Gibson carried a cross up
Temescal Canyon before Passion opened.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.357
- It must have worked, huh?
- BIG BOY: It sure did work.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.276
Vince would've been a gorgeous Jesus.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.112
What's going on?
What you got planned for tonight?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.072
My buddy E got asked out on a date.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.532
ALL: That's nice.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.285
So me and the other guys
are gonna join him.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.787
Wait. Hold on. So your boy got asked out?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.873
- Here we go.
- Relax. It's fine.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.043
His ex-girl crushed him.
So he's looking to get laid.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.085
(ALL LAUGHING)

09:05.170 --> 09:07.087
SHAUNA: Eric, sit down.
Don't fuck with his rhythm.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.172
This is embarrassing.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.132
He's telling the world
about my personal life.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.718
Relax. The world could give
a shit about your personal life.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.802
What are you doing?

09:13.887 --> 09:17.473
- You got some hot celebrity, some models?
- Right. Some hot chicks.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.767
- I don't have a date yet.
- What?

09:19.851 --> 09:21.477
Vincent Chase doesn't have a date?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.811
I find that hard to believe.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.564
We got a lot of females
out there listening right now.

09:25.649 --> 09:28.859
Can we bring somebody up in here? Not Liz.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.403
We gonna take a phone call for you, Vince.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.948
Christy, what do you got tonight?

09:34.032 --> 09:37.534
Stop hitting on my assistant, Turtle.
Besides, she'd never go out with you.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.662
What, she can't speak for herself?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.373
You can speak.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.502
I'd never go out with you, Turtle.

09:46.628 --> 09:47.711
Ouch.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.844
What?

09:57.555 --> 09:59.390
You won't believe who we got on the phone.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.059
- Who?
- Justine Chapin.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.478
White virgin in the house.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.773
- Justine Chapin. She's fabulous.
- She's not a virgin.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.276
You know she's on
that Pure Tour right now.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.611
BIG BOY: Justine, you there?
JUSTINE: I'm here, Big Boy.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.281
How you doing, baby girl?
We got Vince right here, also.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.949
You can't find a date tonight, Vince?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.118
I'm having a little trouble, Justine.

10:19.202 --> 10:23.289
I'm leaving San Diego right now.
I'll be back in L.A. For the night.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.375
I'd love to go out with you.
You look hot on the billboard.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.168
Are you gonna sing for me?

10:28.253 --> 10:31.422
- Singing is all you're going to get.
- That's right.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.133
Big Boy's right. So do you still want to go?

10:34.217 --> 10:37.303
VINCE: Of course.
I'm just looking for someone to cuddle with.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.389
- He's definitely fucking her, right?
- ALL: Definitely.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.890
I'm calling Cindy Adams.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.268
ALL: (CHANTING) Cuddle.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.982
(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

10:50.066 --> 10:51.692
Vince is gonna be there, too.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.945
It's gonna be a nice time, honey.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.656
When did you move away?

10:58.450 --> 10:59.616
Wow!

10:59.701 --> 11:02.411
What about that cute roommate of yours?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.331
Married?

11:05.457 --> 11:07.416
Yeah. Congratulate her.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.378
Yeah. I'll call you if I ever get to Oregon.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.341
(SIGHING)

11:16.426 --> 11:18.427
What do you think, Arnold?

11:19.763 --> 11:21.680
Baby, I know you like my hair natural.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.391
But I'm gonna
put a little product in it, okay?

11:24.476 --> 11:27.936

I had video sex
with an Ecuadorian girl this morning.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.465
I hope she was 18. Federal offense if not.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.718
She had big teeth and a sarong.
That's all I remember.

It's why I bought the thing for you.

I guess you don't want
this one to work out either.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.981

You broke up with me, right?

12:54.065 --> 12:56.733
In case you'd forgotten, we just had sex.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.195
You said it was break-up sex.
What do you want from me?

keep chasing you around?

right now and you know it.

What are you talking about?
You think I like Emily?

No, I think you think I like Emily
and you're trying to shut it down.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.148
Why would I do that?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.526
You don't like it when I get a girl
and you get stuck with the retards.

from the Burbank airport in one hour.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.007
I'm done with that girl.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.885
Where's the exhibitionist?

23:48.969 --> 23:51.096
She's out there cutting it up with Teen Wolf.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.889
Michael J. Fox is here?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.641
No, the guy from the sequel.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.731
Opening night of a hit,
and none of us are getting any action.

24:01.816 --> 24:04.901
All I know is I'm here
with my best friends in the entire world.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.361
- And Ari.
- And Ari.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.948
- And there's no place I'd rather be.
- I'll drink to that.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.491
Here you go, baby.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.244
(ALL CHEERING)

24:17.331 --> 24:20.291
Vince, hi. You go to my gym.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.960
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.880
I'll catch you guys later.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.174
There you go, daddy.

24:29.385 --> 24:32.303
God, I just want to be him
for like a fucking hour.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.807
You think my assistant's hot?
I don't know. I can't tell.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.976
Yeah, I do.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.436
I'm thinking about hitting that.

24:41.305 --> 24:47.328
