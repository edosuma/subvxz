Thank you.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.092
Well, Thursday is Thanksgiving.

00:35.168 --> 00:39.332
A day when a man can enjoy the
companionship of friends and family.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.964
Yeah, yeah.
Yadda-yadda-yadda-yadda.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.067
To a man,
Thanksgiving means two things:

00:44.144 --> 00:46.908
Really sharp knives
and carving up that bird. Am l right?

00:47.013 --> 00:49.982
That's right. And today,
Tim and l will introduce

00:50.083 --> 00:53.382
<i>our first annual Tool Time
turkey-carving race.</i>

00:53.453 --> 00:56.786

Michael and Mario are in town

a great racing icon.
OK, guys, you all set?

01:34.961 --> 01:37.395
- All set.
- Well, you guys may know lndy cars,

01:37.464 --> 01:39.591
but nobody can beat my bird.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.794
[blows raspberry, laughs] Right, Al!

01:42.869 --> 01:47.203

turkey, free-range, butter-injected.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.968

02:13.166 --> 02:16.101
Michael Andretti
is in the poultry position. But look!

02:16.169 --> 02:20.833
Mario's already got a wing off. Al's
not doing bad with his bird. And Tim...

02:20.907 --> 02:24.968
...is the slowest
turkey-carver l've ever seen.

02:25.044 --> 02:28.070
Look at the way Michael Andretti
attacks that thigh.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.015
Mario's no slouch with a drumstick.
And look!

02:31.084 --> 02:33.450
Al's already down to the white meat.

[Tim grunts]

03:46.726 --> 03:48.455
Ooh, what's that?

03:48.528 --> 03:53.295
Wilson gave that to us for Thanksgiving.
lt's a homemade eel pie.

03:56.436 --> 04:01.203
- Eel pie?
- Yeah. A traditional Pilgrim thing.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.835
Which explains why
there are no more Pilgrims.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.212
Wilson's not coming this year.
Why don't we throw it out?

04:08.281 --> 04:12.843
l can't do that. Wilson put his heart
and soul and half his aquarium in it.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.454
Hey, Mom? Remember l'm working down
at the soup kitchen on Wednesday.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.582
They want me to work Thanksgiving. OK?

04:19.659 --> 04:22.127
Sure. lt's great
that you're giving your time.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.891
lt means that our family values
have rubbed off on you.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.297
- What do you mean?
- Well, your father and l

04:28.368 --> 04:32.498
have taught you that holidays are about
sharing and putting other people first.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.473
Honey, look what we got!
The last turkey they had.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.806
The biggest one,
and it's all mine, mine, mine!

04:40.046 --> 04:42.913
l tell you, the holidays
come quicker every year.

04:42.982 --> 04:46.110
[laughs] l know. l just got over
July 4th and it's Thanksgiving.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.016
Oh!

04:48.087 --> 04:50.055
That was fast. Now it's Christmas.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.647
- Sorry, Al.
- Tim.

04:51.724 --> 04:53.885
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. How you doing?

04:53.960 --> 04:56.451
Little brother.
Sorry about not coming for dinner.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.224
Yeah, yeah. What are you gonna do?

04:58.298 --> 05:02.200
You, uh... you starting the
lighting contest a little early?

05:02.268 --> 05:06.534
Well, my strategy this year
is to intimidate Doc Johnson, OK?

05:06.606 --> 05:09.439
What are you gonna do?
Stick a reindeer head in his bed?

05:12.845 --> 05:15.939
- Oh...
- That's not a bad idea.

05:16.015 --> 05:20.475
Harry, what kind of transformer will
get this to light up, like, real bright?

05:20.553 --> 05:23.113
Well, you only need a 50-volt.
But knowing you...

05:23.189 --> 05:24.554
Yeah?

05:24.657 --> 05:28.753
[straining] ...you'll want
the thousand-volt.

05:30.163 --> 05:34.224
So, what time do you want me and llene
to come over for Thanksgiving dinner?

05:34.300 --> 05:38.259
Well, dinner's at three.
Why don't you guys show up at 6, 6:30?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.671
[laughs] Oh, yeah.
You know what? That reminds me.

05:41.741 --> 05:46.303
Benny's looking for you. He's waiting
for his Thanksgiving invite.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.212
l don't know how to tell him,
but he's not getting invited.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.772
You're not inviting Benny?

05:50.850 --> 05:54.217
Well, why is it my turn every year?
Last year he ate 1 2 pounds of turkey,

05:54.320 --> 05:58.484
he drank out of the gravy boat then bobs
for marshmallows in the sweet potatoes.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.227
- You did the same thing.
- My house.

06:05.264 --> 06:09.132
- Hey, hey, hey! Here comes Benny.
- What am l gonna say? What am l...?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.295
- Hey, Benny! How are you doing?
- All right.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.599
What do you got there?

06:12.672 --> 06:16.005
Well, l was a little hungry and it
was sample day at the supermarket.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.474
Care for an imitation crab puff?

06:23.549 --> 06:27.383
[laughs] No. l'm allergic.
l get imitation hives.

06:29.288 --> 06:32.985
Hey, Tim! Tim!

06:33.059 --> 06:35.084
Hey, Benny. l didn't see you.

06:35.161 --> 06:38.460
lt just occurred to me.
Uh, Thursday's Thanksgiving.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.398
Thanksgiving's falling
on a Thursday this year?

06:42.869 --> 06:46.703
Yes. And according to my
social calendar, l have an opening.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.209
Would you like me to grace
your abode with my presence?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.811
Well, l would love you
to grace my abode with your presence.

06:53.880 --> 06:58.214
But, um,
this year we've decided... to...

06:58.284 --> 06:59.717
...go with family.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.448
l understand.
What's everybody else doing?

07:02.522 --> 07:05.616

- Actually, l'm...
- [Tim] Oh-ho!

07:20.773 --> 07:22.536

07:25.111 --> 07:27.079
You were invited to Tim's, weren't you?

07:27.146 --> 07:30.411
Tim's? No! l was... not.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.213
Oh. So, all of a sudden, Al's family?

07:33.286 --> 07:36.016
- l get the picture. l'm not in it.
- Benny, listen to me...

07:36.088 --> 07:38.648
Don't want my company, your loss.
l'm not gonna beg.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.726
l don't need anything from anybody.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.126
l thought you were my friend.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.896
What should we do with these?

07:51.971 --> 07:55.463
Put them in the box. Your dad's
gonna take that when he picks up Randy.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.237
- All right.
- Hey, this is Dad's favorite sweater.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.142
Why are you giving it away?

08:03.049 --> 08:05.313
That's why l'm giving it away.

08:05.384 --> 08:07.875
Well, haven't the needy suffered enough?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.884
Just put it in the bottom of the box.
He'll never miss it.

08:11.958 --> 08:12.925
Here he comes.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.959
Mm-hm. l got Rudolph up on the roof.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.989
Soon as l light up that schnoz, you'll
be able to see it all the way to Akron.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.365
- [Jill] Tim.
- Yeah?

08:24.437 --> 08:26.496

- Right from the aquarium.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.473
- Nobody's gonna eat that.
- Come on! ''You serve it, they'll come.''

Yeah. What's he doing in a soup kitchen?

l don't know. But he must
really be down on his luck.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.498
He's been coming
in here quite a bit recently.

10:04.570 --> 10:08.836
l don't want him to see us. He'll feel
terrible, OK? Let's get out of here.

10:16.882 --> 10:21.012

- Now he's really gonna feel terrible.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.910
lt's not like you ever used it.

14:09.481 --> 14:14.748
Well, who needs a head anyway? Real
charity is about giving of yourself.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.921
[clattering]

14:19.558 --> 14:21.526
[drum roll]

14:25.030 --> 14:26.691
[Wilson] ln here, Tim.

14:27.933 --> 14:28.957
Thanks, Wilson.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.069
Al, go for the three-pointer!

14:33.172 --> 14:34.503
l'm open!

14:36.408 --> 14:38.933
[Tim muttering] Oops!

14:39.011 --> 14:41.138
- [clattering]
- Yes!

14:43.315 --> 14:45.545
<i>[phone rings]</i>

14:57.963 --> 14:59.487
Hello?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.665
Hi, Benny. Yeah.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.899
Listen to me. Um, if you're not
doing anything on Thanksgiving,

15:06.972 --> 15:09.236
would you come over here for dinner?
l mean it.

15:09.308 --> 15:13.039
Yeah. lt was... it was my fault.
l wasn't even thinking about it.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.445
Please? l mean it.

15:16.515 --> 15:17.812
Great. Great.

15:17.883 --> 15:23.822
Come on over about 3:00. We got extra
marshmallows in the sweet potatoes

15:23.889 --> 15:26.858
in case you got a hankering
for a little bobbing.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.824
OK, thanks. Bye.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.025
Ooh, the table looks wonderful!

15:34.133 --> 15:37.762
Well, thanks to the beautiful
horn of plenty you brought.

15:37.836 --> 15:42.603
llene and l made that in our adult ed
class: Cornucopia for Couples.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.675
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh! Oh!

15:46.745 --> 15:50.306
That's Benny. Now, um, just be really
nice to him. But don't overdo it.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.977
You know, because we don't want him
to think that we feel sorry for him.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.151
Benny!

15:59.091 --> 16:04.051
Come in. Boys! Boys! Come downstairs.
Our guest of honor has arrived.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.928
Hey, Benny!
[laughs] lt's good to see you!

16:10.002 --> 16:12.368
Happy Thanksgiving!

16:12.438 --> 16:15.168
l guess my sponge bath
really paid off.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.105
Benny, you can let go now.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.739
Honey, the holidays are about giving.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.406
OK, that's enough.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.677
Hey, Benny.

16:30.956 --> 16:34.323
Happy Thanksgiving. Our extended
family's all here. Good to see you.

16:34.426 --> 16:35.984
- Ah, thanks.
- Tim.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.619
- Yeah.
- The sweater.

16:37.696 --> 16:40.324
Either take it off or shave it.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.468
- Hi, Uncle Benny!
- Hey!

16:44.536 --> 16:46.094
Hey! Happy Thanksgiving, guys!

16:46.171 --> 16:49.334
- Well, it is now that you're here.
- [both laugh]

16:51.677 --> 16:55.977
- OK! Uh, is everybody ready to eat?
- Yeah. This is great!

16:56.048 --> 16:58.414
- Um, boys, you're over there.
- Come on, Benny.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.315
l'm starvin'.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.181
l'm sorry. Did l make a faux pas?

17:05.257 --> 17:07.349
[all] Oh, no!

17:07.425 --> 17:10.361
- Everybody, sit down.
- [Al] l'm a little hungry myself.

17:10.429 --> 17:15.867
OK. Before we begin, l think that we
should hold hands and give thanks.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.902
- Tim?
- OK.

17:17.970 --> 17:21.872
Well, we got lots to be thankful
for this year. Food on the table.

17:21.940 --> 17:25.272
A splendid array of gourds.

17:26.811 --> 17:30.179
And, most of all, we share
this feast with our good friend...

17:30.282 --> 17:31.909
<i>[phone rings]</i>

17:31.984 --> 17:34.214
Excuse me.

17:35.621 --> 17:38.647
Hello. Yeah, Skipper.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.191
Keep praying.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.890
Yeah, what's the spread
on the Lions game? All right.

17:44.963 --> 17:47.625
Put me down for 200 bucks
on Kansas City.

17:47.699 --> 17:51.601
Happy Thanksgiving to you too.
[chuckles]

17:51.670 --> 17:53.900
OK, let's chow down.

17:53.972 --> 17:57.635
Benny, a person who is destitute
shouldn't be gambling.

17:57.709 --> 18:01.236
l agree.
What does that have to do with me?

18:01.313 --> 18:03.338
Well...

18:03.415 --> 18:07.749
The truth is, Randy and l saw you
last night at the soup kitchen.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.187
- What were you doing there?
- Well, Randy's helping out.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.555
- What were you doing there?
- l like the soup.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.361
You like the soup.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.263
That's despicable.
You're stealing food from the needy.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.427
l don't steal it.
l pay for it with my tax dollars.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.438
What tax dollars?
You haven't had a job in years.

18:27.506 --> 18:31.340
- Yeah, you're just a big mooch.
- l let him hug me.

18:32.644 --> 18:37.013
Hey, l don't need this! l give up my
holiday to share it with you people,

18:37.116 --> 18:40.244
- and this is the thanks l get?
- You're blaming us for this?

18:40.319 --> 18:43.413
- lf the shoe fits...
- You'd probably walk out with it!

18:46.458 --> 18:51.725
- l can't believe we felt sorry for him.
- Me neither. He's just a freeloading...

18:51.797 --> 18:54.357
...scalawag!

18:56.168 --> 18:58.329
Scalawag?

19:00.105 --> 19:02.869
Watch your language.
There's children here.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.237
Does this mean we don't have
to call him Uncle Benny anymore?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.337
Doesn't matter.
He's not gonna be around.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.541
Try to forget about this.
Enjoy the meal.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.278
- Carrots, please?
- [Brad sighs]

19:13.352 --> 19:16.082
- Stuffing.
- Here.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.086
<i>Have a little compassion.</i>

19:20.192 --> 19:23.491
<i>Even the lowliest creature
needs a friend.</i>

19:23.862 --> 19:25.887
The turkey looks good.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.358
Real charity
is about giving of yourself.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.927
l know! l know! l know!

19:36.742 --> 19:39.643
l know it tastes good. [chuckles]

19:39.711 --> 19:41.144
Your mom cooked it.

19:41.213 --> 19:43.147
Tell you what. You guys sit still.

19:43.215 --> 19:45.479
Excuse me for a minute.
l'll be right back.

19:53.959 --> 19:57.122
[Tim shudders]
l'm glad you're still here, Benny.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.756
Where else would l go?
Who would want Benny Baroni?

20:00.832 --> 20:03.062
Why would anybody want you, Benny?

20:03.135 --> 20:06.502
You do such sleazy things sometimes.

20:06.572 --> 20:09.473
l don't mean any harm by it.
lt's just my nature.

20:09.541 --> 20:14.001
Yeah. What do you do at Christmas time,
steal something from the Salvation Army?

20:14.079 --> 20:16.206
What would l want with a little bell?

20:17.583 --> 20:21.815
Benny, have you ever heard the phrase
''giving something back?''

20:21.887 --> 20:24.355
- l've heard of it.
- Yeah.

20:24.423 --> 20:25.913
l don't know what it means.

20:27.659 --> 20:33.427
Well, it means taking the time
to think about other people.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.661
People that are really
less fortunate than you are.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.432
l guess l shouldn't have taken soup
from people who really need it.

20:40.505 --> 20:41.767
That's right.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.001
l shouldn't mooch off
of Harry and you...

20:44.109 --> 20:46.942
...every supermarket chain
in the greater Detroit area.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.912
And parts of Toledo.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.407
l know where
l'm spending my Thanksgiving.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.180
At the soup kitchen helping out.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.688
Tell everybody in there
l'm sorry for how l acted.

20:57.756 --> 21:01.920
Hold on a minute, Benny. Before you go,
why don't ya have dinner with us?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.655
We'll all go there after dinner.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.492
- You sure?
- Yeah, l'm sure.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.032
Thanks, Tim. You got a heart of gold.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.070
- Yeah. Knock on wood.
- [knocking]

21:25.717 --> 21:28.550
Hey, l have a sweater just like that.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.315
Not anymore.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.028
Hey, uh, Dad.
We need some more turkey carved.

21:39.097 --> 21:42.362
You came to the right guy.
l'm the world-champion turkey carver!

21:42.434 --> 21:43.401
Not anymore.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.233
[engine revving]

21:55.147 --> 21:56.978
Oh, yeah?

22:03.722 --> 22:05.053
[beeps]

22:15.067 --> 22:16.295
Whoa!
