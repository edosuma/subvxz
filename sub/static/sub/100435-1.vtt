WEBVTT

00:42.876 --> 00:45.412
Jojo Betzler.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.514
Ten years old.

00:47.547 --> 00:51.318
Today, you join the ranks
of the Jungvolk

00:51.351 --> 00:54.822
in a very special
training weekend.

00:56.723 --> 00:57.992
It's going to be intense.

00:59.459 --> 01:02.763
But today, you become a man.

01:04.462 --> 01:08.635
I swear to devote all
my energies and my strength

01:08.668 --> 01:12.273
to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler.

01:13.606 --> 01:17.378
I am willing and ready
to give up my life for him.

01:18.478 --> 01:19.880
So help me God.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.848
Yes, that's right.

01:21.881 --> 01:25.819
- Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?
- Snake mind.

01:25.852 --> 01:29.022
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your body?
- Wolf body.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.692
- Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?
- Panther courage.

01:31.725 --> 01:35.796
- And, Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?
- A German soul.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.531
Yeah, man. You're ready.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.301
- Adolf.
- Hmm?

01:41.368 --> 01:43.670
I don't think I can do this.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.540
Was?
Of course you can.

01:46.573 --> 01:49.609
Sure, you're a little bit
scrawny and a bit unpopular

01:49.642 --> 01:52.878
and you can't tie your shoelaces
even though you're ten years old.

01:52.912 --> 01:57.818
But you're still the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.354
Not to mention the fact
you're really good-looking.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.523
So, you're gonna get out there
and you're gonna have a great time, okay?

02:03.556 --> 02:06.660
- Okay.
- That's the spirit. Okay.

02:06.693 --> 02:07.761
Heil me, man.

02:07.794 --> 02:08.862
Heil Hitler.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.665
What? You can heil me
better than that.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.033
- Heil Hitler.
- No...

02:13.066 --> 02:14.968
Just throw it away.
Don't even think about it.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.037
- Heil Hitler.
- No, you're overthinking it.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.972
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil "Hitterler."

02:19.439 --> 02:21.241
Who's "Hitterler?"
Do you even speak German?

02:21.274 --> 02:24.444
- Heil Hitler.
- That's not a heil. This is a heil. Heil!

02:24.477 --> 02:26.589
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler!

02:26.613 --> 02:28.515

02:28.548 --> 02:30.383
Ooh, that's it.
You've got it. Heil Hitler.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.061
- Have a great day! You're gonna be the best.
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!

02:32.085 --> 02:34.987
- Heil Hitler! You can do it.
- Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!

02:35.021 --> 02:38.058

Heil Hitler, guys.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.543
Heil Hitler!

04:36.576 --> 04:40.547
Jungvolk, welcome to
the Hitlerjugend training weekend.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.917
In which we will make
men and women of you all.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.753
My name is Captain Klenzendorf.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.655
You may call me Captain K.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.023
Captain K. Whoo!

04:52.158 --> 04:55.295
Ja. And this is
Sub-Officer Finkel.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.830
This is Fräulein Rahm.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.298
Hey. Heil Hitler, everyone.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.700
So a little about me.
Who am I?

05:00.733 --> 05:03.270
And why am I here talking to a bunch
of little titty-grabbers

05:03.303 --> 05:07.574
instead of leading my men into battle
towards glorious death? Great question.

05:07.607 --> 05:11.111
I've asked it myself every day
since Operation Screw Up

05:11.144 --> 05:15.782
where I lost a perfectly good eye
in a totally preventable enemy attack.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.551
And according to my superiors,

05:17.584 --> 05:20.220
you need two eyes to be a meaningful part
of the war effort.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.723
Can two-eyed people do this?

05:31.898 --> 05:34.100
- Jesus.
- Over the next two days,

05:34.133 --> 05:37.604
you little critters will get to experience
some of the things

05:37.637 --> 05:40.974
that the mighty German army
goes through every day.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.352
And even though it would appear
our country's on the back foot

05:43.376 --> 05:46.112
and there really isn't much
hope in us winning this war,

05:46.145 --> 05:47.981
apparently
we're doing just fine.

05:52.085 --> 05:56.189
Anyway. You boys have all been issued
with your Deutsches Jungvolk daggers.

05:56.222 --> 05:59.593
These are very special
and expensive weapons.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.861
You should never
be without them.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.863
And don't try to
stab each other.

06:03.896 --> 06:04.998
No stabbing!

06:05.965 --> 06:07.100
No stabbing.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.770
This is your first step
towards being men.

06:10.336 --> 06:13.940
Today you boys will be involved in such
activities as marching, bayonet drills,

06:13.973 --> 06:17.277
grenade-throwing, trench-digging,
map-reading, gas defense,

06:17.310 --> 06:19.179
camouflage, ambush techniques,

06:19.212 --> 06:21.848
war games, firing guns,
and blowing stuff up.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.620
The girls will practice
important womanly duties

06:26.653 --> 06:29.321
such as dressing wounds,
making beds,

06:29.355 --> 06:32.157
and learning how
to get pregnant.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.258
Aw.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.729
I've had 18 kids for Germany.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.066
Such a great year to be a girl.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.302
All right. Let's get to it.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.737
Come on.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.303

06:47.840 --> 06:49.676

- Serpent's tongue, ja.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.292
- Scales.
- Ja, scales.

07:39.325 --> 07:43.129
Because, once upon a time,
a Jewish man mated with a fish.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.464
Whoa!

07:44.497 --> 07:46.833
We, Aryans, are one thousand times

07:46.866 --> 07:50.203
more civilized and advanced
than any other race.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.439
Now, get your
things together, kids.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.340
It's time to burn some books.

08:36.047 --> 08:37.816
Not to me.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.052
If I met one,
I'd kill it like that.

08:41.921 --> 08:45.058
Like... that.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.025
But how would you know
if you saw one?

08:47.059 --> 08:48.461
They could look just like us.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.529
I'd feel its head for horns.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.432
And they smell like
brussels sprouts.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.802
Oh, yeah. I forgot about
the brussels sprouts bit.

08:55.835 --> 08:59.105
Imagine catching one
and giving it to Hitler.

08:59.138 --> 09:02.208
That'd be a surefire way to
get into his personal guards.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.978
Then we would become
best friends.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.981
I thought I was
your best friend.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.984
Yorki, you're
my second-best friend.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.419
First place
is reserved for the Führer.

09:13.452 --> 09:17.823
So, unless you're Hitler
hiding in a fat, little boy's body...

09:17.857 --> 09:19.359
I'd be happy with second place.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.096
I guess I'm just a kid in a fat kid's body.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.798
Case closed.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.870
Raah! Raah! Raah!

09:30.903 --> 09:35.441
When you stand before the enemy
and have to end his life,

09:35.474 --> 09:38.311
which of you will have
the stomach to do this?

09:39.946 --> 09:41.080
Good.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.184
There is no room
in Hitler's army

09:44.217 --> 09:46.452
for those that lack strength.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.022
We want hardened warriors.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.892
Those that are prepared
to kill at will.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.327
Can you do this?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.462
- Yes.
- Ja.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.566
Johannes.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.203
Can you kill?

10:04.203 --> 10:08.208
Pfff. Of course.
I love killing.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.578
Good. Come here.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.582
Don't be scared. Come on.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.985
Good.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.361
Kill it.

10:30.329 --> 10:32.265
Huh?

10:32.298 --> 10:35.302
Wring its neck
and kill the rabbit.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.972
Or are you scared?

10:39.005 --> 10:41.607
I'm not scared. I... I just...

10:43.075 --> 10:44.411
Now.

10:46.279 --> 10:50.917
Place both hands around its
neck and then one hard twist.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.120
He might scream, but we'll just use
the boot to finish it off.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.460
Kill. Kill.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.963
Kill. Kill.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.132
Kill. Kill.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.035
Kill. Kill. Kill.

11:09.068 --> 11:12.138
Kill.
Kill. Kill.

11:12.171 --> 11:16.109
Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill.

11:16.142 --> 11:20.146
Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.948
- Shoo! Come on, shoo.
- Hey! Hey, hey.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.922
Good shot.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.059
You are a coward.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.295
Just like your father.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.497
He... He's not a coward.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.532
- He's fighting in Italy.
- Really?

11:39.565 --> 11:41.434
But no one has heard
from him in two years.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.269
He is a deserting coward.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.005
He's scared and so are you.

11:47.039 --> 11:51.444
You're as scared
as a little rabbit.

11:53.512 --> 11:55.315
Scared little rabbit.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.951
Maybe we should snap
your neck, too?

11:57.984 --> 11:59.285
Jojo the rabbit.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.393
Jojo Rabbit.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.362
Jojo Rabbit.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.500
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.275
Poor Jojo.
What's wrong, little man?

12:23.442 --> 12:26.611
- Hi, Adolf.
- Wanna tell me about that rabbit incident?

12:26.645 --> 12:28.281
What was all that about?

12:29.115 --> 12:30.549
They wanted me to kill it.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.486
I'm sorry. I couldn't.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.022
Don't worry about it.
I couldn't care less.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.991
But now they call me
a scared rabbit.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.424
Let them say whatever they want.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.228
People used to say a lot
of nasty things about me.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.763
"Oh, this guy's a lunatic."

12:43.796 --> 12:46.733
"Oh, look at that psycho.
He's gonna get us all killed."

12:48.534 --> 12:52.539
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The rabbit is no coward.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.310
The humble little bunny faces
a dangerous world every day,

12:57.343 --> 13:00.747
hunting carrots for
his family, for his country.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.417
My empire will be
full of all animals.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.787
Lions, giraffes, zebras,

13:07.820 --> 13:10.490
rhinoceroses, octopuses,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.258
rhinoctopuses.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.028
Even the mighty rabbit.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.129
Cigarette?

13:16.162 --> 13:18.031
Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

13:18.064 --> 13:21.167
Let me give you
some really good advice.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.302
Be the rabbit.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.605
The humble bunny
can outwit all of his enemies.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.774
He's brave and sneaky
and strong.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.711
Be the rabbit.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.079
Jojo!

13:35.214 --> 13:36.716
Are you all right, Jojo?

13:38.451 --> 13:39.652
Who were you talking to?

13:39.685 --> 13:41.421
Nobody.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.755
Oh, I thought you were crying.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.791
Are you a teardrop specialist?

13:45.357 --> 13:46.426
No.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.693
Case closed.

13:48.727 --> 13:53.266
Now, it's time for Jojo
to show those stick insects

13:53.299 --> 13:56.469
who is the real cowardly rabbit.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.239
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

13:59.805 --> 14:00.740
Never mind.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.808
Jojo, where are you going?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.378
To be the rabbit!

14:05.411 --> 14:08.581
Jojo Rabbit. Jojo Rabbit.
Hunting carrots. Jojo Rabbit.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.483
Hey, this is amazing.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.518
We're like two human antelopes.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.728
Now, lads, each of you
will be given the opportunity

14:22.761 --> 14:26.199
to ignite and throw a grenade.

14:27.299 --> 14:30.303
I will personally
be supervising each of you

14:30.336 --> 14:33.505
to make sure you don't blow
your eyes out or something.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.374
All right, who's first?

14:35.407 --> 14:36.442
Klaus.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.718
Shit.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.786
Shit!

15:23.722 --> 15:25.492
Don't do that.

15:26.825 --> 15:28.661
Jojo. Jojo.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.531
Finkel! Finkel!

15:31.564 --> 15:32.732
Jojo, Jojo.

15:36.468 --> 15:37.870
O-M Gott.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.940
He looks like
a Picasso painting.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.616
His mother's going to kill me.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.166
My darling cub.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.206
Hey, kid.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.580
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

16:54.613 --> 16:57.450
Mmm. My darling little cub.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.485
Why so happy?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.954
Your son is ugly like a monster.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.557
Hey. You're no monster.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.325
Besides, your scars will heal,

17:06.357 --> 17:08.002
and you'll get most of the
movement back in your leg.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.771
But I'll never be
in Hitler's personal guards.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.464
Ah, you're fine as you are.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.000
I'm just happy to have you
back home. Hmm?

17:14.032 --> 17:15.867
Mama Lion worries about her cub,

17:15.901 --> 17:18.471
especially when
Papa Lion isn't here.

17:18.503 --> 17:19.705
Or Inge Lion.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.510
Or Inge Lion.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.650
You grab the rabbit by the tail,
wrap it around his ear,

17:30.683 --> 17:33.987
tie it all up and then
stuff him back down the hole.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.455
Now then,
let's get on our way, huh?

17:37.489 --> 17:40.035
I think getting out of the house
will do wonders for your recuperation.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.395
I don't want to go out there.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.463
What? Don't be silly.
Of course you do.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.565
I look stupid.

17:46.598 --> 17:47.867
People will stare.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.502
Enjoy the attention, kid.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.704
Not everyone's
lucky enough to look stupid.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.874
I, for one, am cursed
to look incredibly attractive.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.076
Now, you're going to
pluck up your courage,

17:57.109 --> 18:00.079
walk out that door and have
an incredible adventure.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.414
Okay?

18:01.447 --> 18:02.447
Okay.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.985
Field Marshal Jojo,
you're our top man.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.579
Prepare to leave the house.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.456
Is it dangerous?

18:10.723 --> 18:11.858
Extremely.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.427
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh, Jesus.

18:15.661 --> 18:16.629
Hey!

18:16.662 --> 18:17.806
- Looking good, kid.
- Heil Hitler!

18:17.830 --> 18:21.567
Frau Betzler, you're looking
fetching as usual.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.803
Okay, wow.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.038
It's because of you
my son can't walk properly

18:26.071 --> 18:27.473
and has a messed-up face.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.875
He stole my hand grenade.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.811
- Just took it...
- Ja, ja.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.648
So, you are going to look after him
while I'm at work, hmm?

18:35.681 --> 18:38.417
Make sure he has a job
and feels included. Got it?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.720
Got it. Ja, I really got it.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.122
Good.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.391
Guys, this is Johannes Betzler.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.759
The kid I told you about.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.627
Remember,
he stole a hand grenade

18:48.660 --> 18:50.463
and blew himself up
and as a result

18:50.496 --> 18:52.465
I got demoted for negligence.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.468
Now I get to work in this office
with all these wonderful kids.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.905
So, Jojo. I'm sure we can figure out
something for you to do.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.574
- Oh!
- Ideas?

19:01.607 --> 19:02.675
- Ja.
- Guys?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.076
Ja. Ja.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.913
Okay, well, we need somebody
to walk the clones.

19:09.748 --> 19:14.387
Also, I think maybe he could
hand out this new propaganda,

19:14.420 --> 19:17.724
and deliver these conscriptions.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.626
I don't suppose
I could be conscripted?

19:20.659 --> 19:21.694
Could I?

19:21.727 --> 19:23.095
Oh, yes,
that's a wonderful idea.

19:23.128 --> 19:24.697
Yes, I give my full permission

19:24.730 --> 19:26.766
for you to send this
ten-year-old child into war.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.166
Will someone get this kid a gun?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.011
And I'd be more than happy
to fight in the front.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.137
Get in line, kid.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.038
Okay. Here are
the conscriptions,

19:33.071 --> 19:34.140
and here is a gun.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.840
Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:35.874 --> 19:37.108
It's a bit... for the gun?

19:37.142 --> 19:38.411
No.

20:13.745 --> 20:14.781
Yuck.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.050
Look.

20:26.191 --> 20:27.460
What did they do?

20:29.194 --> 20:30.530
What they could.

20:31.830 --> 20:32.865
Come on.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.650
Hey-hey! Jojo Rabbit!

20:51.683 --> 20:54.552
Oh, look at your face.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.823
I am a soldier!
I'm going to war!

20:57.856 --> 20:59.758
And you are a postman!

21:01.093 --> 21:04.897
Jojo Rabbit, Jojo Rabbit!

21:05.664 --> 21:06.699
Mama?

21:08.033 --> 21:10.503
Field Marshal Jojo is home.

21:12.905 --> 21:13.940
Mama?

21:19.244 --> 21:22.748
Mama? I'm home.

21:24.883 --> 21:25.918
Mama?

21:43.835 --> 21:44.871
Mama?

23:55.834 --> 23:56.869
Hi.

24:37.175 --> 24:38.411
What do you want?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.680
Are you a ghost?

24:41.346 --> 24:43.715
Sure. A ghost.

24:52.057 --> 24:54.059
Don't make me run, kid.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.494
I'm far too hungry

24:55.527 --> 24:57.863
and you know how much
we love the taste of blood.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.404
Lose something?

25:07.072 --> 25:10.042
I'm not a ghost, Johannes.
I'm something worse,

25:10.075 --> 25:12.144
but I think you already
know that, don't you?

25:12.811 --> 25:13.846
You know what I am.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.815
- No.
- Yes.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.751
Say it.

25:18.784 --> 25:19.819
Say it!

25:20.352 --> 25:21.420
A Jew.

25:22.788 --> 25:23.856
Gesundheit.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.059
You can't be here.

25:27.092 --> 25:28.527
Well, your mother invited me,

25:28.560 --> 25:30.796
so I suppose that makes me
her guest.

25:30.829 --> 25:33.965
- It's not allowed.
- What will you do, sweet Hitlerchen?

25:33.999 --> 25:35.034
Hmm?

25:38.436 --> 25:39.472
Of course.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.408
Go on, then. Tell them.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.378
But do you know
what happens if you do?

25:47.345 --> 25:49.781
I'll tell them you helped me.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.817
And your mother, too.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.919
Then we'll all be kaputt.

25:53.952 --> 25:59.023
And if you tell her you know
about me, just one word...

26:00.192 --> 26:02.461
I'll do the world
a great, big favor

26:02.494 --> 26:04.329
and cut your Nazi head off.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.299
Got it?

26:07.332 --> 26:08.400
Ja.

26:17.475 --> 26:20.913
I think I'll hold onto this.
It's pretty.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.956
Sheesh. That was intense.

26:30.989 --> 26:33.425
- What am I going to do?
- Honestly, no idea.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.194
I mean,
there could be more of them.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.196
Hundreds of them
living in your walls.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.433
How did she get control
like that?

26:41.466 --> 26:42.935
She must've used her powers.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.002
Mind control.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.537
Oh, typical.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.005
- Did you see how fast she moved?
- Yes.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.474
Like a little,
female Jewish Jesse Owens.

26:50.508 --> 26:53.345
- And now she's got your fancy knife.
- My knife!

26:53.378 --> 26:56.181
Yeah. Like a little, female
Jewish Jesse Owens,

26:56.214 --> 26:58.050
Jack the Ripper.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.052
You're definitely
in a pickle, my friend.

27:00.085 --> 27:02.154
Ah, what to do, what to do?

27:02.187 --> 27:03.388
- Oh. Got it!
- Got it!

27:03.421 --> 27:04.932
- I will negotiate.
- Burn down the house

27:04.956 --> 27:06.925
and blame Winston Churchill.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.128
Or negotiate. Hmm.

27:24.609 --> 27:26.045
Excuse me?

27:27.412 --> 27:28.848
Little girl?

27:30.081 --> 27:33.152
Um... Jew girl in the wall?

27:34.953 --> 27:37.556
Yoo-hoo. Jew?

27:43.028 --> 27:48.433
Okay, well, I'll just say what
I have to say and that's this:

27:48.466 --> 27:52.638
I'm not scared of you and I think you
should find somewhere else to live.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.906
Okay?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.341
Not okay.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.282
Get the hell out of my room.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.520
She's pretty rude, you know?

28:08.553 --> 28:10.155
That's just my two Pfennige.

28:10.588 --> 28:12.691
- And now she's got two knives.
- I know!

28:12.724 --> 28:15.593
- How are you going to chop up stuff?
- I don't know!

28:15.627 --> 28:17.296
Oh, and she's
still up there, too.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.931
That... that thing, that, that...

28:18.964 --> 28:20.531
- Jew.
- Yeah. Jew, yeah.

28:20.565 --> 28:23.010
- What are we gonna do about that Jew?
- You think of something.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.970
Oh, now I'm the expert?

28:25.003 --> 28:27.506
Stop offering me
damned cigarettes! I'm ten!

28:27.539 --> 28:29.675
All right. Sorry.
I'm stressed out!

28:29.708 --> 28:32.210
Okay, let's talk like turkeys.

28:32.243 --> 28:35.179
You can't tell your mother
or that Jew will cut off your Nazi head,

28:35.213 --> 28:38.716
but there's no reason this thing
in the attic needs to ruin your life.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.619
In fact, you could use it
to your advantage.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.155
How?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.223
When someone tries to use
mind powers on me,

28:45.256 --> 28:46.258
know what I do?

28:46.291 --> 28:47.993
Use mind powers back on them.

28:48.026 --> 28:50.495
Remember last year when that
one-arm pirate von Stauffenberg

28:50.528 --> 28:52.130
tried to blow me up
with a table bomb?

28:52.163 --> 28:53.231
Yeah, you survived.

28:53.264 --> 28:54.299
Correctomundo.

28:54.332 --> 28:55.600
The only reason I survived,

28:55.633 --> 28:57.402
apart from having
bombproof legs,

28:57.435 --> 29:00.071
is because I outwitted
old von Stauffy.

29:00.105 --> 29:04.009
I let him think that I was dead,
when in actual fact, I was absolutely fine.

29:04.042 --> 29:07.279
By pretending I was dead,
I drew out all the traitors.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.514
So what are you going to do?

29:09.114 --> 29:10.148
Pretend I'm dead?

29:10.181 --> 29:12.551
Exactly. Wait, no.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.353
No, what I mean is this:

29:14.386 --> 29:16.355
make her feel safe
and then she'll drop her guard

29:16.388 --> 29:18.056
and then you will be
the one in control.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.025
- Reverse psychology.
- Don't complicate things.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.761
Just use my backwards
mind power trick,

29:22.794 --> 29:24.629
and everything will be fine.

29:24.662 --> 29:26.331
Ooh! I gotta go.

29:26.364 --> 29:28.404
We're having unicorn for dinner
at my place tonight.

29:28.733 --> 29:30.735
Concentrate, Jojo.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.005
Remember,
a Jew living in your wall

29:33.038 --> 29:35.339
is better than two Jews flying around
with their bat wings

29:35.373 --> 29:37.543
climbing down chimneys
and eating innocent Nazis.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.545
And don't give her
any more knives.

29:40.578 --> 29:41.613
Tschüss.

30:07.205 --> 30:10.275
Darling cub,
why are you up, huh?

30:10.308 --> 30:12.077
Did you eat anything, hmm?

30:12.110 --> 30:13.345
Sorry, I lost track of time.

30:13.378 --> 30:15.178
I was taking a long walk
and having a thing...

30:15.447 --> 30:18.283
What are we going to do
with these laces, huh? My goodness.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.285
You'll learn how to
tie them eventually, no?

30:20.318 --> 30:22.521
- I heard her.
- What?

30:22.554 --> 30:23.589
Who?

30:25.090 --> 30:26.158
Inge.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.161
Her ghost.

30:29.194 --> 30:32.031
Oh. That's so sad for you.

30:33.398 --> 30:34.533
You've lost your mind.

30:34.566 --> 30:35.834
It's sadder for me, though,

30:35.867 --> 30:37.603
because I have to live
with a crazy person.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.574
I heard noises. Upstairs.

30:42.607 --> 30:45.844
Ghosts? Honestly.
You know what I heard? Rats.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.846
Yes, we have them.
Can you believe that?

30:47.879 --> 30:49.614
Dirty animals.

30:49.647 --> 30:51.725
I've been meaning to tell you
to stay away from upstairs,

30:51.749 --> 30:53.485
until I've cleared
them all, okay?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.353
I don't need you getting sick.

30:55.386 --> 30:56.422
Okay, Mama.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.658
I'll watch out
for those dirty rats.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.062
Where are all
the goddamn knives?

31:17.575 --> 31:19.211
Are you going to bed, too?

31:20.478 --> 31:22.247
Yes. Soon.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.382
I have to tidy
some things first.

31:24.415 --> 31:25.451
What things?

31:27.152 --> 31:28.520
Mama things.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.663
Boy, you have to trust me, okay?

31:29.687 --> 31:31.390
I'm the boss here, ja?

31:32.657 --> 31:34.559
I guess.

31:34.592 --> 31:36.228
Good boy.

31:36.494 --> 31:38.831
Yes, but with... with one eye. Like...

31:40.365 --> 31:41.532
Almost.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.368
Not quite.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.608
Great. You got it.

31:50.642 --> 31:51.677
Ja.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.849
You have to be more quiet.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.452
He heard noises up here.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.123
If I have to choose
between you and my son, I...

32:09.260 --> 32:10.862
I won't know where to send you.

32:10.895 --> 32:12.597
You hear me?

32:12.630 --> 32:14.867
He can't know.
If he knows, then they know.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.436
- You could reason with him.
- You don't know him.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.140
He's a fanatic.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.250
It took him three weeks
to get over the fact

32:23.274 --> 32:24.843
that his grandfather
was not blond.

32:26.244 --> 32:27.746
I know he's in there somewhere.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.683
The little boy who loves to
play and runs to you

32:31.716 --> 32:33.552
because he's scared of thunder.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.654
Thinks you invented
chocolate cake.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.459
In the end, that's all you have.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.895
Hope...

32:44.096 --> 32:46.498
that your only remaining child
is not just another ghost.

32:47.932 --> 32:50.836
Perhaps we're all ghosts now.
We just don't know it.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.370
Perhaps.

32:55.406 --> 32:57.608
You've lived
more lifetimes than most.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.180
I haven't lived at all.

33:03.514 --> 33:04.883
You're being challenged.

33:05.950 --> 33:08.954
They say you can't live,
that you won't live.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.722
If that comes true,
then they win.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.191
They've been winning so far.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.894
They'll never win.
That's the power you have.

33:15.927 --> 33:19.731
As long as there's someone alive,
somewhere, then they lose.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.901
They didn't get you yesterday or today.
You make tomorrow the same.

33:26.437 --> 33:27.472
Hey.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.242
Tomorrow must be the same.

34:00.805 --> 34:02.440
Jesus Christ!

34:02.473 --> 34:03.808
You must stretch.

34:03.841 --> 34:05.019
Does that hurt you?

34:05.043 --> 34:07.646
- Yes.
- Good. Pain is your friend.

34:07.678 --> 34:09.513
Soon your leg will only be

34:09.547 --> 34:11.516
a little bit deformed
and pointless.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.952
I'm going to recommend another
month off school though

34:13.984 --> 34:16.588
because your face
might scare the other kids.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.422
It's kind of ugly.

34:18.455 --> 34:20.458
Okay, who's next?

34:25.062 --> 34:26.463
Jojo.

34:26.496 --> 34:27.799
Baby, I have to go.

34:30.801 --> 34:33.338
I'll see you at home. Mmm.

34:39.976 --> 34:41.913
- Hi, Captain K.
- Hey.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.357
If it isn't
Herr Hand Grenade himself.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.416
Ah.

34:44.447 --> 34:46.550
How's the leg, kid?

34:46.583 --> 34:48.351
It's pretty much healed.

34:48.386 --> 34:50.755
It only 80% hurts now.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.456
What are you guys doing?

34:52.489 --> 34:54.324
I'm being made
to teach the HJ boys

34:54.359 --> 34:56.094
water warfare training.

34:56.127 --> 34:57.862
You know, in case they ever need

34:57.895 --> 34:59.764
to go to battle
in a swimming pool.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.503
Can I ask you
a question about Jews?

35:05.536 --> 35:07.572
Oh, God. Why?

35:09.874 --> 35:11.709
What should I do if I see one?

35:11.743 --> 35:12.844
Ugh. Okay.

35:12.877 --> 35:15.613
If you see a Jew, you tell us,

35:15.646 --> 35:17.716
we tell the Gestapo,
and they tell the SS,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.451
and then they go
and they kill the Jew.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.520
And anyone who helped the Jew.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.356
And because these are very
paranoid times,

35:24.389 --> 35:26.358
probably some
other people just in case.

35:26.391 --> 35:27.858
It's a pretty drawn out process.

35:27.892 --> 35:31.496
Even if the Jew
hypnotized someone

35:31.529 --> 35:33.465
to make them hide
the Jew in the first place?

35:33.498 --> 35:34.999
I'd be amazed
if that could happen.

35:35.032 --> 35:36.601
No, it can happen.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.807
It happened to my uncle.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.510
A Jew hypnotized him

35:45.543 --> 35:48.512
and he became a massive
drunk and a gambler.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.115
And he cheated on his wife

35:50.148 --> 35:53.751
and he had an inappropriate
relationship with my sister.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.755
And then he drowned
in an unrelated accident,

35:56.788 --> 35:59.023
but it was the Jew's fault.

35:59.056 --> 36:01.593
Anyway. Did you see one?
A Jew.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.498
-I'm not sure I'd be able to tell if I did.
-Yeah, me neither.

36:06.531 --> 36:08.600
Without their funny hats,
it's damn near impossible.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.802
Someone should write a book
on the subject.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.479
It would make things so much easier.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.405
- It would be a hit.
- Ja.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.076
Finkie, they're drowning.
Come on.

36:19.577 --> 36:20.687
I'll see you later, little man.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.068
Okay, here's the situation.

36:44.035 --> 36:47.071
If I tell on you,
you'll be in big trouble,

36:47.104 --> 36:49.207
and I don't think you want that.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.110
But then you'll tell on me and my mother,
and we'll be in trouble,

36:52.143 --> 36:53.945
which I don't want.

36:53.978 --> 36:57.449
And if you tell my mother I know,
then she'll kick you out,

36:57.482 --> 36:59.117
which you don't want.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.885
And if I tell my mother I know,

37:01.919 --> 37:04.789
then you'll
cut off my Nazi head,

37:04.822 --> 37:06.724
which I also don't want.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.528
So, it's a Mexican stalemate.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.597
It's just a normal stalemate.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.965
I have some conditions
for allowing you to stay here.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.801
- "Conditions?"
- Yes.

37:16.834 --> 37:20.439
Tell me everything
about the Jewish race.

37:20.938 --> 37:21.972
Okay.

37:23.808 --> 37:24.943
We're like you,

37:26.677 --> 37:27.745
but human.

37:27.778 --> 37:29.948
Please take this seriously.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.217
Think of this as an exposé.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.085
I want to know all your secrets.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.589
Kindly refrain from sitting
on my sister's bed.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.824
Why? She doesn't need it.

37:39.857 --> 37:41.893
You know nothing of my sister.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.195
Inge and I were friends.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.730
I remember you.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.832
Such a funny little boy.

37:47.865 --> 37:49.901
Enough with the small talk.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.037
Start telling me
about your kind.

37:53.838 --> 37:56.207
Obviously, we are demons
who love money.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.542
Right?

37:57.575 --> 37:59.644
Obviously.
Everyone knows that.

37:59.677 --> 38:03.780
But what people don't know
is that we're also allergic to food.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.251
Cheese, bread, meat.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.986
That stuff
will kill us instantly.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.822
So, if you're thinking
of ending my life,

38:10.855 --> 38:12.690
that's the fastest way.

38:12.723 --> 38:14.493
Also biscuits, lethal.

38:16.994 --> 38:18.662
Very funny.

38:19.096 --> 38:21.099
Anyway, there's not enough
food for you,

38:21.132 --> 38:22.733
so I don't know
what you're going to do.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.670
Your mother managed
to find me some bread.

38:25.703 --> 38:28.940
She's kind.
She treats me like a person.

38:28.973 --> 38:31.075
But you're not.
Not a proper person.

38:31.108 --> 38:32.611
Are you?

38:34.712 --> 38:36.948
How dare you, Jew!

38:36.981 --> 38:40.618
You are weak like an eyelash.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.555
I am born of Aryan ancestry.

38:43.588 --> 38:47.124
My blood is the color
of a pure red rose.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.927
And my eyes are blue like...

38:50.294 --> 38:51.663
Break free.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.668
Break free, great Aryan.
There are no weak Jews.

38:57.201 --> 39:00.572
I am descended from those who
wrestle angels and kill giants.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.607
We were chosen by God.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.577
You were chosen by a
pathetic little man

39:05.610 --> 39:07.579
who can't even grow
a full mustache.

39:09.747 --> 39:10.949
The stronger race, huh?

39:19.056 --> 39:22.660
So, how's it all going
with that Jew thing upstairs?

39:22.693 --> 39:24.729
Well, she doesn't want
to talk to me.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.798
Mm-hmm. Well, you are a Nazi.

39:26.831 --> 39:28.599
I guess.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.069
This book is going
to be harder to write than I thought.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.938
Hmm.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.876
What's she doing? She's burning something.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.612
What is she burning?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.981
- What are you burning?
- She can't hear you.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.849
What are you burning?

39:56.293 --> 39:57.695
Why so happy?

39:57.728 --> 39:59.030
Things are changing.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.664
The Allies have taken Italy.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.934
France will be next
and soon the war will be over.

40:02.967 --> 40:06.003
Goddamn it!
Why does that make you happy?

40:06.037 --> 40:07.639
You hate your country that much?

40:07.672 --> 40:09.374
I love my country.
It's the war I hate.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.142
It's pointless and stupid,

40:11.175 --> 40:12.877
and the sooner
we have peace, the better.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.345
Oh, the war will end.

40:14.378 --> 40:17.048
We will crush our enemies
into dust.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.383
And when they are destroyed,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.051
we shall use
their graves as toilets.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.986
Okay. No more politics.

40:22.019 --> 40:24.287
Dinner is neutral ground.
This table is Switzerland.

40:24.321 --> 40:25.724
Let's eat.

40:34.832 --> 40:35.867
You aren't eating.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.871
No. I am not that hungry.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.673
I might eat later.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.075
For now, I am just going to
chew on these grapes.

40:47.712 --> 40:50.415
Well, I'm especially hungry
tonight.

40:50.448 --> 40:54.052
So maybe I'll just finish yours.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.654
Don't want it to go to waste.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.170
How was your day, Johannes?

41:12.203 --> 41:14.806
Oh, you know,
just wandered around,

41:14.839 --> 41:16.908
being a deformed kid
with nothing to live for.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.276
You're not deformed.

41:18.309 --> 41:22.080
My face looks like
a goddamn street map, woman.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.450
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.052
If my father were here,
he'd get it.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.887
Well, he's not.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.958
I know. And instead,
I'm stuck with you.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.194
You want your dad, 'eh?

41:36.227 --> 41:37.261
Yeah, I do.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.297
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.465
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

41:40.498 --> 41:41.800
Fine.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.747
Don't you ever talk

41:55.780 --> 41:57.248
to your goddamn mother
like that!

42:14.365 --> 42:16.034
Paul, what happened?

42:17.468 --> 42:18.770
Paul?

42:18.803 --> 42:20.171
I yelled at the kid.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.407
What? Go apologize.

42:25.943 --> 42:26.978
Sorry, kid.

42:27.011 --> 42:28.279
What?

42:28.312 --> 42:29.981
What kind of apology was that?

42:39.290 --> 42:40.425
Sorry, kid.

42:44.595 --> 42:45.863
Jojo...

42:47.264 --> 42:49.901
I know you miss me, but I'm...

42:49.934 --> 42:52.970
I'm out there trying to make
a difference in the world.

42:53.337 --> 42:54.773
And while I'm gone,

42:55.539 --> 42:58.276
I need you
to take care of my Rosie.

42:59.844 --> 43:00.912
Can you do that?

43:03.547 --> 43:05.016
Yes, Dad.

43:05.516 --> 43:06.550
Thanks.

43:08.319 --> 43:09.554
She's doing what she can.

43:12.623 --> 43:15.293
Oh, gosh.
We made a good kid, huh?

43:16.427 --> 43:19.329
Mm-mm! Damn, that's good.

43:19.363 --> 43:23.100
It reminds me of dancing
with Rosie in The Red Salon.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.269
You remember, honey?

43:25.302 --> 43:26.838
Of course I do, babe.

43:35.346 --> 43:38.916
Hey, don't just sit there, kid.

43:38.949 --> 43:39.983
Come.

43:40.017 --> 43:41.452
Dance with your parents, come.

44:29.266 --> 44:33.137
So, I'd like you to draw
a picture of where Jews live.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.472
Where you all eat, sleep,

44:35.506 --> 44:37.575
and where the queen Jew
lays the eggs.

44:38.142 --> 44:39.543
You really are an idiot.

44:39.576 --> 44:41.256
Come on. We have a lot of work to do.

44:42.379 --> 44:43.681
Tell me about your family.

44:43.714 --> 44:45.316
I'll tell you about the Jews,

44:45.349 --> 44:47.093
but you are not privileged
to know about my family.

44:47.117 --> 44:48.586
But I need background.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.988
Why are you
hanging around with me?

44:51.021 --> 44:52.223
Don't you have any friends?

44:52.256 --> 44:53.925
Of course. Yorki.

44:53.958 --> 44:55.425
- "Yorki?"
- Amongst others.

44:55.459 --> 44:57.995
Well, you don't have anyone.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.230
I have Nathan.

44:59.263 --> 45:01.265
"Nathan?"
Who the hell is that?

45:01.298 --> 45:04.334
- My fiancé. I have him.
- Where is he?

45:04.368 --> 45:06.671
Fighting in the resistance, see.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.409
He proposed to me
on the banks of the Fluß.

45:11.442 --> 45:15.646
He knelt down like a proper gentleman,
recited a poem by Rilke.

45:15.679 --> 45:18.382
And when I said yes,
we danced into the night.

45:18.415 --> 45:20.251
Snore.

45:20.284 --> 45:21.385
Who's Rilke?

45:21.418 --> 45:23.387
A great poet.
Nathan's favorite.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.155
Oh, Nathan's favorite? Yay.

45:25.189 --> 45:27.959
He's coming to rescue me,
then we'll go live in Paris.

45:28.525 --> 45:30.595
You'd turn your back
on Germany forever?

45:31.295 --> 45:32.729
It turned on me first.

45:32.763 --> 45:34.632
Well, we don't need you.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.001
You and your stupid boyfriend
can shut up

45:37.034 --> 45:41.606
and go live in damn
cheese, snail, baguette land.

45:42.172 --> 45:44.375
Now, now, just because
you don't have a girlfriend.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.177
I'm way too busy for a girlfriend.

45:46.210 --> 45:48.412
One day, you'll make time.

45:48.445 --> 45:50.381
You'll think of nothing else.

45:51.148 --> 45:53.684
You'll meet someone
and spend your days

45:53.717 --> 45:56.954
dreaming of the moment you can
hold them in your arms again.

45:58.322 --> 45:59.356
That's love.

46:01.658 --> 46:03.561
- Ridiculous.
- Finished.

46:13.737 --> 46:16.340
I said to draw where Jews live.

46:16.373 --> 46:19.077
This is just a stupid picture
of my head.

46:19.476 --> 46:21.345
Yeah. That's where we live.

46:27.651 --> 46:30.454
Rilke, Rilke, Rilke.

46:30.487 --> 46:33.590
Where are you?
Poetry-writing dumbhead.

46:33.624 --> 46:34.692
Ah.

46:34.725 --> 46:37.294
Yes. Great thinking, Rabbit.

46:37.327 --> 46:40.363
We'll use all of these books to make
a fake floor that she'll fall through.

46:40.397 --> 46:42.733
Straight into
a pit full of piranhas

46:42.766 --> 46:45.670
and... and lava and bacon.

46:46.136 --> 46:47.714
- Why, she won't know what hit her.
- Shh!

46:47.738 --> 46:49.240
- Shh?
- Shh!

46:49.273 --> 46:51.041
You shush. Shush me?

46:51.075 --> 46:53.277
Let's get a book and let's go.
Libraries are dumb.

46:57.781 --> 47:01.685
Yeah, this is a really good idea,
what we're doing right now.

47:01.718 --> 47:05.390
If she had a heart, this would
break it clean in two.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.094
I have something to tell you.

47:10.127 --> 47:13.831
I came across
an old letter from Nathan,

47:13.864 --> 47:16.367
your fiancé, addressed to you.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.302
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'll just read it.

47:21.138 --> 47:25.076
"Dear Elsa, this is hard
for me to say,

47:25.109 --> 47:27.645
"but I don't want
to marry you anymore.

47:28.712 --> 47:31.315
"I found a new woman
and we laugh a lot

47:31.348 --> 47:33.150
"and do the tongue-kiss.

47:33.183 --> 47:35.586
"It's like my favorite poet,
Rilke, says,

47:35.619 --> 47:40.658
"'We need in love to practice only this:
letting each other go.'

47:41.325 --> 47:44.095
"So, goodbye and sorry
about letting you go.

47:44.128 --> 47:47.731
"From Nathan, your ex-fiancé.

47:48.332 --> 47:51.202
"PS, I'm not really
in the resistance.

47:51.235 --> 47:52.369
"I was lying.

47:52.402 --> 47:55.073
I'm unemployed
and quite fat now."

48:20.731 --> 48:23.901
Um... don't open the door,

48:23.934 --> 48:28.406
but I actually forgot
there was a second letter.

48:28.872 --> 48:32.510
"Dear Elsa...

48:32.543 --> 48:37.280
"I just wanted to let you know that I don't
want to break up with you now.

48:37.314 --> 48:41.352
"I changed my mind because I don't want you
to kill yourself over me,

48:41.385 --> 48:43.687
"which a couple of girls
have done in the past,

48:43.720 --> 48:45.756
"and it's pretty stressful.

48:45.789 --> 48:47.691
"I need you to stay alive.

48:47.724 --> 48:50.260
"Thank God you're being
taken care of by that kid

48:50.294 --> 48:54.431
"who I must say is a remarkable young man
beyond his years.

48:54.464 --> 48:55.799
"And brave, too.

48:55.832 --> 48:57.868
"And let's still
get married sometime,

48:57.901 --> 48:59.803
"even though
I am truly unemployed

48:59.836 --> 49:01.539
"and have nothing
going on for me.

49:02.573 --> 49:05.710
Yours, Nathan."

49:14.418 --> 49:15.753
- Beethoven.
- Einstein.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.320
- Bach.
- Gershwin.

49:17.354 --> 49:19.323
Brahms. Wagner. Mozart.

49:19.356 --> 49:20.791
Musicians, is that all you have?

49:20.824 --> 49:21.858
Rilke.

49:21.892 --> 49:23.460
Oh, yeah, of course.

49:23.493 --> 49:25.663
Your favorite, Rilke.
Jewish mother.

49:25.696 --> 49:26.730
Dietrich, then.

49:26.763 --> 49:28.499
Houdini.

49:28.865 --> 49:31.969
- No. That's impossible.
- Believe it, brother.

49:32.002 --> 49:35.206
Just ask Pissarro, Modigliani,
Man Ray, Gertrude Stein,

49:35.239 --> 49:38.576
Mr. Moses and the king of them all,
Jesus Christi. Amen.

49:38.609 --> 49:39.877
Pew, pew, pew!

49:39.910 --> 49:41.679
Well, you're just saying
any old name now.

49:41.712 --> 49:44.582
I've never heard of these people
and now I'm fed up.

49:44.615 --> 49:45.950
Hey.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.618
If you find any more
of those letters,

49:47.651 --> 49:48.819
will you let me know?

49:49.286 --> 49:50.387
Sure.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.722
Okay.

49:51.755 --> 49:52.789
Bye.

49:55.692 --> 49:58.563
Ah, these banks used to be full of lovers.

49:59.529 --> 50:01.832
There was dancing and singing.

50:02.966 --> 50:05.002
Romance.

50:05.035 --> 50:07.304
There's no time for romance.

50:07.337 --> 50:08.572
We're at war.

50:08.605 --> 50:11.509
Oh. There's always time for romance.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.712
Someday you'll meet
someone special.

50:14.745 --> 50:16.847
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

50:17.814 --> 50:19.417
Who else tells you that?

50:20.517 --> 50:22.319
Everyone.

50:22.352 --> 50:23.621
Anyway.

50:23.654 --> 50:24.922
It's a stupid idea.

50:24.955 --> 50:27.725
You're stupid.

50:27.758 --> 50:30.261
Love is the strongest thing
in the world.

50:30.294 --> 50:33.564
I think you'll find that metal
is the strongest thing in the world.

50:33.597 --> 50:36.400
Followed closely by dynamite,
and then muscles.

50:37.367 --> 50:40.504
Besides, I wouldn't
even know it if I saw it.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.606
Surprise, surprise.

50:42.639 --> 50:44.575
Your shoelaces are undone again.

50:46.743 --> 50:47.978
Oh, Jojo.

50:48.011 --> 50:49.914
You'll know when it happens.

50:50.981 --> 50:52.850
You'll feel it.

50:52.883 --> 50:53.985
It's a pain.

50:54.618 --> 50:56.587
- In my arse, I bet.
- In your tummy.

50:56.620 --> 50:59.257
Like, like, you're
full of butterflies.

50:59.990 --> 51:02.026
- Yuck.
- Yeah, "yuck."

51:03.327 --> 51:05.796
Come on, Shitler.
Let's get a move on.

51:06.997 --> 51:08.799
Whoa!

51:08.832 --> 51:10.701
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

51:10.734 --> 51:13.837
I'm worried about you, man.
Are you drunk? Again?

51:13.870 --> 51:15.306
Come on. Oh, God.

51:15.339 --> 51:17.041
Could you
please untie them?

51:17.074 --> 51:19.409
- You're really getting fat.
- I'm not...

51:19.443 --> 51:21.879
You know what? Why don't I
just leave you here, okay?

51:21.912 --> 51:23.681
- No.
- I'll come and get you tomorrow.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.449
- Okay? How about that?
- No. Mama, Mama!

51:25.482 --> 51:26.717
You'll figure it out, darling.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.385
- No!
- I'll meet you back at the house.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.621
- I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Mama, Mama!

51:31.088 --> 51:32.990
You're growing up too fast.

51:33.023 --> 51:36.860
Ten-year-olds shouldn't be
celebrating war and talking politics.

51:36.893 --> 51:39.663
You should be climbing trees

51:39.696 --> 51:41.865
and then falling out of
those trees.

51:41.898 --> 51:43.800
But the Führer says when we win

51:43.834 --> 51:46.637
it is us, young boys
who will rule the world.

51:46.670 --> 51:47.704
Pfft!

51:48.905 --> 51:50.708
The Reich is dying.

51:50.741 --> 51:51.975
We're going to lose the war

51:52.008 --> 51:54.611
and then what are you
going to do, hmm?

51:54.644 --> 51:56.013
Life is a gift.

51:56.046 --> 51:58.582
We must celebrate it.

51:58.615 --> 52:02.886
We have to dance to show God
we are grateful to be alive.

52:09.159 --> 52:11.427
Well, I won't dance.

52:11.461 --> 52:13.630
Dancing is for people
who don't have a job.

52:13.663 --> 52:15.666
Dancing is for people
who are free.

52:15.699 --> 52:17.601
It's an escape from all this.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.471
Well, you're free
to dance your way home.

52:20.504 --> 52:21.972
I'll ride.

52:22.005 --> 52:23.106
Oh, no, you don't.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.775
No one can stop me.

52:44.127 --> 52:46.029
Welcome home, boys!

52:46.062 --> 52:47.965
Now, go home
and kiss your mothers!

53:08.185 --> 53:10.587
No news from Nathan today,
I'm afraid.

53:10.620 --> 53:12.689
He's probably doing
something amazing,

53:12.722 --> 53:14.892
like reading a book
or growing a beard.

53:18.662 --> 53:19.764
What's wrong?

53:22.732 --> 53:24.535
You want me to tell you
about the Jews?

53:25.202 --> 53:26.504
Don't care.

53:27.971 --> 53:30.741
In the beginning,
we used to live in caves.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.777
- Deep, deep in the center of the Earth.
- Wait.

53:33.810 --> 53:37.781
Scary places full of strange
and wonderful creatures

53:37.814 --> 53:39.450
all with one thing in common.

53:39.483 --> 53:41.685
Mm-hmm. Stealing
the ends of penises?

53:41.718 --> 53:43.654
No, you idiot.

53:43.687 --> 53:46.056
- The love of art.
- No cutting penises off?

53:46.089 --> 53:47.524
Do you want the story or not?

53:47.557 --> 53:49.860
You may continue,
but I know it's true.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.061
The penis thing.

53:51.094 --> 53:53.030
Rabbis use them for earplugs.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.831
And moving on.

53:54.865 --> 53:58.202
After many years of developing
magic and spells,

53:58.235 --> 54:02.238
we slowly moved out of
the caves and into the towns.

54:02.272 --> 54:05.843
Some of us stayed in the caves,
though, in animal bodies.

54:05.876 --> 54:08.679
Which are blobs or something?

54:08.712 --> 54:10.113
Well, I'll draw them for you.

54:23.693 --> 54:24.929
There.

54:25.762 --> 54:27.597
It'd be better with color.

54:27.898 --> 54:29.099
Where's the horns?

54:29.132 --> 54:30.166
Under the hair.

54:31.835 --> 54:33.136
Where's yours?

54:33.169 --> 54:34.738
I'm too young.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.641
- They grow when you turn 21.
- Oh.

54:37.674 --> 54:40.077
These days we live among normal people,

54:40.110 --> 54:42.278
but often we take over a house

54:42.312 --> 54:44.948
and hang from
the ceiling when we sleep.

54:44.981 --> 54:46.150
Like bats.

54:46.783 --> 54:48.852
Oh, and another thing is

54:48.885 --> 54:50.220
we can read each other's minds.

54:50.253 --> 54:52.155
Oh, my God.

54:52.188 --> 54:53.690
Everyone's minds?

54:53.723 --> 54:56.126
- What about German minds?
- No.

54:56.159 --> 54:58.729
Their heads are too thick
for us to penetrate.

54:59.696 --> 55:03.701
Like birds, our true language
sounds like singing.

55:05.001 --> 55:08.639
And we're also attracted
to shiny things.

55:08.972 --> 55:13.243
Crystals, glass and gold.

55:13.276 --> 55:17.114
"Attracted to shiny things."

55:18.315 --> 55:19.749
But also ugly things.

55:19.783 --> 55:21.552
Jews love ugliness.

55:21.585 --> 55:24.021
That's another thing
we learned at school.

55:24.054 --> 55:26.023
You love them, yes?

55:26.056 --> 55:27.091
Ugly things.

55:34.130 --> 55:35.332
Hi.

55:35.365 --> 55:37.267
You two seem to be
getting on well.

55:37.834 --> 55:39.970
I was just making sure
she was still alive.

55:40.003 --> 55:41.671
- What do you care?
- I don't.

55:41.705 --> 55:44.641
I just don't want
a dead person in my house.

55:44.674 --> 55:46.877
- How would you like it?
- I'd love it.

55:46.910 --> 55:48.845
More dead people
in my house, please.

55:48.878 --> 55:50.990
Look, just all the time
you two are spending together,

55:51.014 --> 55:53.083
it's making me feel
very uncomfortable.

55:53.116 --> 55:54.885
You suggested it
in the first place.

55:54.918 --> 55:55.986
Did I?

55:56.019 --> 55:57.654
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

55:57.687 --> 56:00.591
Besides, it's for the book.

56:01.257 --> 56:02.858
Oh, God, you're right.

56:02.892 --> 56:04.361
I'm sorry.
Did I make it weird?

56:04.394 --> 56:05.996
It's weird now, isn't it?

56:06.029 --> 56:08.098
It shouldn't be weird
between us.

56:08.131 --> 56:10.901
None of this should be weird.

56:10.934 --> 56:13.170
It's fine. I'm just tired.
I'm going to bed.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.138
Ja, I was just keeping
your bed warm for you.

56:15.171 --> 56:17.641
'Cause that's
what real friends do.

56:17.674 --> 56:19.710
Hey, what do think
about this uniform?

56:19.743 --> 56:21.320
I'm not sure
about the hips on the pants.

56:21.344 --> 56:22.780
Should they be bigger?

56:23.313 --> 56:25.682
- You look great.
- Thank you.

56:25.715 --> 56:28.952
Now, listen, Jojo.
Can I give you some really good advice?

56:29.252 --> 56:31.121
When you see what's in her mind

56:31.154 --> 56:33.857
and where she's trying
to make you go in your mind,

56:33.890 --> 56:37.160
in your mind,
you must go the other way.

56:37.193 --> 56:38.595
Get what I'm saying?

56:38.795 --> 56:40.896
Do not let her put you
in a brain prison.

56:40.930 --> 56:42.232
That, dear Jojo,

56:42.265 --> 56:45.769
is one thing that cannot
and must not ever,

56:45.802 --> 56:48.070
ever happen to a German!

56:48.104 --> 56:52.643
Do not let your German brain
be bossed around!

56:52.676 --> 56:56.179
I won't let her boss
my German brain around, mein Führer.

56:56.212 --> 56:57.648
Try not to.

56:59.049 --> 57:03.053
Now, I think you've got
a lot of good information in your book.

57:03.086 --> 57:05.389
It's time to show it
to the world, don't you think?

57:06.222 --> 57:07.257
Ja.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.696
- Adolf?
- Hmm?

57:12.729 --> 57:14.098
Do you think I'm ugly?

57:15.098 --> 57:16.200
Yes.

57:25.241 --> 57:26.877
Is he asleep?

57:26.910 --> 57:28.712
Mmm.

57:28.745 --> 57:29.847
He's different.

57:31.148 --> 57:33.916
He suspects something.
He thinks Inge's ghost lives up here.

57:37.987 --> 57:40.057
You remind me of her.
You really do.

57:41.491 --> 57:44.094
I would love to have seen her
grow into a woman.

57:46.396 --> 57:49.800
But I'll have to
watch you instead.

57:55.071 --> 57:57.274
I don't know anything
about being a woman.

57:58.975 --> 58:00.244
Is that what it is?

58:01.311 --> 58:03.180
You do things like drink wine?

58:05.014 --> 58:07.718
Sure. You drink.

58:07.751 --> 58:09.920
Champagne, if you're happy.

58:09.953 --> 58:11.188
Champagne, if you're sad.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.458
You drive a car.

58:15.425 --> 58:17.294
Gamble if you want.

58:17.327 --> 58:19.095
Own diamonds.

58:19.129 --> 58:21.064
Learn how to fire a gun.

58:21.097 --> 58:22.499
You travel to Morocco.

58:22.532 --> 58:24.267
Take up lovers.

58:24.300 --> 58:26.403
Make them suffer.

58:26.436 --> 58:28.104
You look a tiger in the eye.

58:29.873 --> 58:31.141
And trust without fear.

58:31.174 --> 58:33.143
That's what it is to be a woman.

58:34.377 --> 58:35.713
How do you do that?

58:36.980 --> 58:39.817
How do you know
you can trust someone?

58:41.117 --> 58:42.152
You trust them.

58:44.521 --> 58:45.756
Good night.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.461
All those other things.

58:51.494 --> 58:53.796
Did you do that stuff?

58:53.830 --> 58:57.768
You know,
go to Morocco and the rest?

58:58.868 --> 59:00.036
No.

59:00.069 --> 59:01.939
I never looked a tiger
in the eye.

59:20.190 --> 59:23.325
Finkel, I meant we'd need dogs
for when the city is attacked,

59:23.359 --> 59:26.163
not actual German shepherds.

59:27.597 --> 59:28.932
Get them out of here.

59:29.532 --> 59:30.733
Get them out of here!

59:31.334 --> 59:35.138
- Now! Now! Now!
- Move along, please. Move along, please.

59:35.171 --> 59:37.007
Thank you, thank you.

59:40.009 --> 59:42.245
- I'm sorry for yelling at you.
- I feel so stupid.

59:42.278 --> 59:44.915
No, no. It's a silly name for a dog.
I should've been more clear.

59:44.948 --> 59:46.784
- You're doing a great job.
- Danke.

59:49.619 --> 59:51.086
Hiya, kid.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.056
How can we help you today,
Master Betzler?

59:53.089 --> 59:55.158
What's up? Walk with me.

59:55.191 --> 59:58.094
If someone turned in a Jew,
would they get a medal or something?

59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.897
Jews, Jews, Jews.
You're still going on about those people?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.433
You know I'm preparing the city
for imminent invasion, right?

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.569
I'm trying to plan
a defense strategy.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.270
I've got Americans to the west,

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.972
got Russians to the east.

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.974
My friend once met some
Russians and they ate him.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.111
Who's the walnuts?

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:16.346
Walnuts are just walnuts, kid.

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:18.181
What do you want to talk about?

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.450
Well, I am learning
a lot about Jews.

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:23.486
Did you know Jews
can read each other's minds?

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:26.488
And when they sleep,
they hang from the ceiling, like bats.

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:29.860
That's fascinating.
And where did you come by this information?

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.264
Research.
I'm writing a book.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.566
Oh, congratulations.
What's it called?

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.168
Yoohoo Jew.

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.636
It's an exposé on Jews.

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:44.407
You could also call it
Who Are You, Jew?

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.411
Or what about Jews News?

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.547
Oh, you do have
a wonderful imagination on you.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.216
- But it's real.
- Ja, of course it's real.

01:00:53.249 --> 01:00:56.486
When I was your age,
I had an imaginary friend called Conny.

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.421
He used to wet my bed
when I was asleep.

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.356
He got me in so much trouble.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.910
Hey, come here. You might like
to check out what I'm working on.

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.428
As part of our preparations
for the invasion,

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:06.997
I'm redesigning my uniform.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.965
Note, the feathers
for aerodynamics,

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.568
the sparkly color
to dazzle the enemy,

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.603
the boots purely decorative.

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:15.105
And this,

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:18.441
this is a Gatling gun
mounted with a radio

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:22.646
which emits annoying music
to dishearten the enemy.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.581
This is all copyrighted,
by the way.

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:25.982
That means you can't copy it.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.118
Ja. Don't get any ideas, kid.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:33.556
The kids tell me that
your father's away fighting.

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:36.460
So it appears you are now
the man of the house. How's that going?

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.962
It's okay.

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.662
Ja?

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:43.532
So, what jobs
do you have for me today?

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:45.201
Well, I've got one, I won't lie.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.270
It's a bit of a step down
from what you're used to,

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.940
but we need all hands on deck
right now.

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.443
Metal for Hitler!

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:56.479
Pots and pans
for the war effort!

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:59.182
♪ Here comes the metal man ♪

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:02.052
♪ Looking for
your pots and pans ♪

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:05.055
- Metal for Hitler!
- Metal for Hitler!

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.222
Nuts and bolts!

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:07.457
Pots and pans!

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:31.214
"Free Germany."

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:37.621
Jojo?

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:41.024
- Yorki?
- Hi!

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.029
You're a soldier now?

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:47.564
At your service.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.399
But you're only 11.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.633
I know.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.568
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.171
Is that paper?

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:58.240
That's what I thought at first, too,
but it's "paper-like."

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.743
It's the latest material

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.045
invented by our top scientists.

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:04.414
Well, I'm impressed.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.416
Hey, Yorki.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.186
I caught a Jew. A real one.

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.688
Oh, a Jew?

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.289
I saw some that they caught

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.157
hiding in the forest last month.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.661
Personally, I didn't see
what all the fuss was about.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:21.530
They weren't at all scary
and seemed kind of normal.

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.400
Oh, I'm getting distracted.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.235
I got to go.

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.636
Bye.

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.138
- Bye.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.073
It's so hard to run
in this thing.

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.179
I found these.

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:41.351
You can have them.
They're probably broken.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.353
Doesn't mean anything.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.489
Maybe you can draw something
for my book.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:49.758
I could draw you again.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:52.095
No one wants to see
pictures of cripples.

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.399
You're hardly a cripple.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.603
Besides, true artists
don't see that stuff.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:02.172
Blind artists, you mean.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:04.574
It's fine.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.743
I'll just accept I'll be
one of those guys

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.378
who'll never get to kiss a girl.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.714
You will be kissed, Jojo.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.551
Do you want me to kiss you?

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:19.222
Okay.

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.191
Two things.

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:22.659
Thing number one:

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.628
It's illegal for Nazis and Jews
to hang out like we do,

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.396
let alone kiss.

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.499
Thing number two:

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:33.336
It'd just be a sympathy kiss,
which doesn't count.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.106
You're not a Nazi.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.641
Uh, I'm massively
into swastikas,

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.743
so I think that's a pretty
good sign right there.

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.779
You're not a Nazi, Jojo.

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:46.516
You're a ten-year-old kid
who likes swastikas

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.351
and likes dressing up
in a funny uniform

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.587
and wants to be part of a club.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.656
But you are not one of them.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.359
Okay.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:59.096
Let's just agree to disagree.

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:01.364
All right?

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.432
"Not a Nazi."

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.735
What a dirty Jew.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.488
Come on. Hide.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:05:59.556
Hurry. Go.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:07.731
Heil Hitler.

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:09.966
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:12.735
I'm Captain Herman Deertz
of the Falkenheim Gestapo.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:15.205
With me, Herr Mueller,
Herr Junker,

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.674
Herr Klum and Herr Frosch.
May we come in?

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.244
Thank you so much.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.388
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:23.522
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:24.657
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.783
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.016
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.910
Hey, Jojo!

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.311
Hey, guys!

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.845
Good to see you!

01:06:56.879 --> 01:07:00.350
My bicycle got a flat tire,
so I carried it.

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:02.719
- Captain Klenzendorf. Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:03.863
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:04.997
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.132
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:06.856
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:09.692
You know Freddy Finkel.

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:10.836
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.903
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.038
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:15.164
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:15.731
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:16.866
So, did I miss anything?

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.636
No, no. We were just
" Heil Hitlering" the boy

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:20.947
and then
" Heil Hitlering" yourself

01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:23.506
and then, of course,
" Heil Hitlering" Freddy Finkel

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:27.510
and now we are in the midst
of a routine inspection.

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.479
And, uh, what brings
you here, Captain?

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.615
Oh, we were just passing by

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:35.751
and we thought we'd drop off
some pamphlets for the boy.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.387
He works for us.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.923
- I see.
- Ja.

01:07:40.956 --> 01:07:43.693
- And yourself?
- Oh, you know how it is.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.561
Every day we take a call.
"Hello, is that the Gestapo?

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:49.632
I believe there's a Communist
hiding behind my fridge."

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:52.002
We go around to investigate.
It's just some mold.

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:53.803
So, not far off.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.005
It's all part of the job.

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.743
Oh!

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:03.546
Now this is my kind
of little boy's bedroom.

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:05.682
Oh, yes.

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:06.850
There he is.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.860
You and your friends
may have heard a rumor

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.320
that Hitler only has one ball.

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:11.586
This is nonsense.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.390
He has four.

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:18.327
So, you are volunteering at
the Hitlerjugend office, yes?

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:20.029
Yes.

01:08:20.062 --> 01:08:21.764
Oh, good for you.

01:08:21.796 --> 01:08:25.600
I wish more of our young boys
had your blind fanaticism.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:29.939
What on Earth
are those oafs up to?

01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:32.608
Why don't we go upstairs
and see, yes?

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:41.017
Do you know
where your mother is?

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:44.087
No. I think she's in town.

01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:47.723
Has she been spending
much time at home?

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.660
She is quite busy.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.394
Is she?

01:08:55.063 --> 01:08:57.733
Well, I'm pleased to see
that you're wearing your...

01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:59.035
jugend uniform,

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.837
but...

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.639
where is your knife?

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.377
You must always carry
your DJ knife. Where is it?

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:12.515
- I left it...
- It's here.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.020
And who might you be?

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:22.625
Well, who might you be?
And what are you doing in my house?

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:24.960
You live here too?

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.130
I'm his sister, Inge.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.835
Heil Hitler.

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:34.303
Heil Hitler.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.446
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:36.582
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:38.907
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.051
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:41.185
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.321
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:45.448
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.517
I did not know you had a sister, Johannes.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.819
Sometimes he'd prefer
if I was dead.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.953
Isn't that right,
little Frankenstein?

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:54.424
Now, now.
There is no need to attack

01:09:54.457 --> 01:09:56.959
his hideous physical deformity.

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.828
That is a war wound.

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:02.499
But, uh, why do you
have his knife?

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:07.437
I'm guarding my room because
he refuses to stay out of it.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:09.038
Well, what do you
have hidden in there?

01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:11.741
Oh, you know, girl stuff.

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.811
May I?

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:15.879
Naturally.

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:26.756
You see, we deal with an inordinate
number of reports,

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:31.194
denunciations
and general investigations.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.196
And, of course,
we are indeed interested

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.132
in problems of crime
and anti-party sentiment,

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:39.202
but we still have
one greater concern,

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.539
that of the "Goldilockses."

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:47.810
Sneaking around,
eating other people's food,

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.812
sleeping in their beds.

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.714
It really is quite rude.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:55.084
I don't suppose I could
see your papers, could I?

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.722
Papers, Miss Betzler.
Quickly, please. We don't have all day.

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.758
Yes, of course.

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.499
How old are you in this photo?

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.669
They're three years old.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:47.970
I was 14.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.639
Date of birth?

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.276
First of May.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.745
1929.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.553
Correct.
Thank you, Inge.

01:12:03.586 --> 01:12:05.888
Get a new photo. You look
like a ghost in this one.

01:12:05.921 --> 01:12:06.990
Wait.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.129
What is...

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:15.698
this?

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.069
Yoohoo Jew.

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:22.672
Tell me, who did this?

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.241
I did.

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.976
It's an exposé on Jews.

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:30.279
How they think, behave, look.

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:31.848
It'll be a gift to the Führer.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.210
Guys, you have to see this.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.789
Oh, look at this one.
He has a tail.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:42.992
There's one of them
hanging upside down like a bat.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.996
This one here, it is
a drawing of their heads.

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:49.999
And who is operating
the machinery of their brains?

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.801
The devil.

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.803
Ah, it's funny 'cause it's true.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.305
Oh, look at
this little, stupid Jew.

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.107
There they are with horns.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.609
What is this?

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.011
"Die, Nathan, die."

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.914
"Ways of killing Nathan."

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.716
Nathan being tortured by snakes.

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:07.883
Poked with sticks.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.619
Being fired from a cannon

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:11.287
and just being called names.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:14.056
Yeah.
Nathan being crushed under the wheel

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.158
of an old-time
penny-farthing bicycle.

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.760
Who is Nathan, please?

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.896
Just some boy.

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:23.733
Nathan being roasted over an open fire.

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:25.668
Reminds me,
we must get back and...

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.812
- You remember? Cause we left that guy hanging up.
- Ja. Ja.

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.872
Thank you for this.
You have really made my day.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.708
I do hope you continue with it.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.243
And, of course,

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:37.113
if you see anything suspicious,
give us a ring.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.182
Good day.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:41.717
Heil Hitler.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.086
Heil Hitler.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.695
Nice to meet you, Inge.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.136
Stay home, Jojo.

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.437
Look after your family.

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:02.872
Look after this knife.

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.695
Elsa, you fooled them.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:27.797
May seventh.

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:30.799
What?

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.972
She was born on the seventh,
not the first.

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.210
He was helping us.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.346
They'll be back.

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:47.016
They'll figure out she's dead,
then I'll be dead.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.954
Nobody really knows Inge died.

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:55.725
You could be her.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.928
I'll tell Mama everything
when she gets home.

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:03.866
That I know you
and that we're friends.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.137
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:16.946
Man, that was a complete bust.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:18.247
You mind explaining that?

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.449
She's not...

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.219
She doesn't seem
like a bad person.

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:30.259
I am beginning to question your loyalty

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.828
to myself and the party.

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.397
You call yourself a patriot?

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.967
Yet, where is the evidence?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.170
The German soldier
was born out of necessity.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.839
Germany depends on the passion
of these young men.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:47.008
Passion and the readiness
to fall for the Fatherland

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:51.347
despite the futile efforts
of Allied war profiteers

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:56.352
who send their ill-prepared armies clumsily
into the lair of the wolf.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:16:00.222
And only zealous men who stand steadfast
in the face of the enemy

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:03.559
will be etched
in German memory forever.

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:07.830
And it is up to you to decide
if you want to be remembered,

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.298
or disappear without a trace

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:14.537
like a pitiful grain
of sand into a desert of insignificance.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.010
To put it plainly...

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:25.981
get your shit together
and sort out your priorities.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.817
You're ten, Jojo.

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:29.151
Start acting like it.

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:13.455
No.

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.772
Did you know?

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:45.474
She didn't tell me much...

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:48.444
only that she worked
with her friends

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.780
and your father was
somehow involved from afar.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.683
No. He's fighting in the war.

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:59.422
She said he'll be home
as soon as the war's over.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:03.526
She didn't want to tell you
anything for obvious reasons.

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:06.428
Because she hated me.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.697
'Cause I'm a Nazi.

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.133
I'm the enemy.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.443
She didn't want you
to know anything

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.503
that could get you in trouble.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.105
But now I have nothing.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.575
No one.

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.649
The last time I saw my parents
was at the station.

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:30.186
They were put on a train.

01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:34.190
I ran.

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.326
Slowly found my way
back to the city.

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.863
A friend of my father's hid me.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.299
Then another friend,
then friends of friends.

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:47.503
Until your mother took me in.

01:21:50.539 --> 01:21:52.108
And so far, I'm still here.

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.512
But my...

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:59.782
my parents went to a place
you don't come back from.

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:06.622
What's the first thing
you'll do when you're free?

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.326
Dance.

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:30.246

That's it. That's it. Hurry.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:24.860
Yorki?

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:26.995
Jojo!

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:31.900
Oh, God.

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:33.467
Jojo.

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.471
How I've missed you.

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.774
Sorry about your mama.

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:41.577
I cried for ages
when I heard what happened.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.680
What's going on out here?

01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:46.982
The Russians, Jojo.
They're coming.

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.984
And the Americans
from the other way.

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:52.487
And England and China
and Africa and India.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.589
The whole world is coming.

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:55.990
Help me with this ammo.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.062
- And how are we doing?
- Terribly.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:02.097
Our only friends
are the Japanese.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:05.734
And just between you and me,
they don't look very Aryan.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.469
- Remember that Jew I told you about?
- Oh, yeah.

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:09.638
I still have her.

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:11.373
She's basically
my girlfriend now.

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:13.975
Oh, good for you, Jojo.
A girlfriend.

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:17.779
But, you know, she's Jewish.

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:20.916
There are bigger things to worry about
than Jews, Jojo.

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:23.352
There's Russians
somewhere out there.

01:25:23.385 --> 01:25:25.087
They're worse than anyone.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.557
I heard they eat babies
and have sex with dogs.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.625
I mean, like, that's bad, right?

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:31.793
Sex with dogs?

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:34.096
Yeah.
The Englishmen do it, too.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:37.632
We have to stop them before they eat us
and screw all our dogs.

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:38.934
It's crazy.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.570
And now Hitler's gone,
we're really on our own.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:46.842
- What?
- You didn't hear?

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.643
He's dead.

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.611
He gave up
and blew his brains out.

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.114
No.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.515
That's impossible.

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:54.750
Blew them out.

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:56.118
His brains.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.887
Turns out he was hiding
a lot of stuff from us.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.757
Doing some really bad things
behind everyone's backs.

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:03.725
I'm not sure
we chose the right side.

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.076
Okay. Come here. Okay.
See that American there?

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:25.480
Just go give him a hug.
Go! Run! Let's go!

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:27.549
Oh, Yorki. Yorki, great news.

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.884
You've just been promoted,
and you get your own pistol.

01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:32.487
Just go and shoot anybody
who looks different to us.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.923
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.658
Jojo, where's your uniform?

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:40.027
Here. Here,
put the jacket on

01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:41.563
so they know not to shoot you.

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:45.700
We must kill everything
that we see.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:46.769
For Hitler.

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:50.105
Die, devil scum!

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:51.607
Die!

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.088
Fall out!

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:29.271
Whoo! Ha!

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.707
Ja.

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:55.831
Come. This way.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.775
They are here!

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.044
The Americans!

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.585
Come on.

01:29:16.618 --> 01:29:18.738
- Stay on him.
- Behind you, Cap.

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:22.124
Over here. Come on, go!

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:54.856
I'll check him.

01:30:06.034 --> 01:30:08.870
Hey, boys! Whoo-hoo!

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.846
Move the prisoners.

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:20.148
Keep the prisoners all in line.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.159
Quickly. Quickly!

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:35.097
Hey! Hey!

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:38.800
What?

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:42.737
I-I don't understand.

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:45.240
Move! Move!

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.210
Get up, wretched dog.

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.116
Captain K.

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:57.084
Heya, kid.

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:58.753
Look at all this commotion, huh?

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:00.989
- What's happening?
- Hysteria, my friend.

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.758
We've come...
We've come to the end.

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:04.993
- Party's over.
- No, I'm not like them.

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:07.829
- Are you scared? Don't be scared.
- No. Please.

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:10.198
- Look at me.
- No. No.

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:15.037
I'm sorry about Rosie.
She was a good person.

01:31:19.741 --> 01:31:21.009
An actual good person.

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:24.279
Okay?

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:27.882
Hey. It's okay, kid.

01:31:27.915 --> 01:31:30.218
Shh, shh, shh.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:35.857
I've been meaning to tell you. I think
your book is really great.

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:37.892
Ja, I'm sorry
for laughing at it.

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:39.027
Very creative.

01:31:39.527 --> 01:31:41.096
Come here,
let's take a look at you.

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:43.364
You look good.

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:44.466
You're okay, kid.

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.737
Now, go home. Look after
that sister of yours.

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.105
Okay?

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:53.775
Get away. Get away, Jew.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.745
- Hey! What's going on?
- Get away!

01:31:56.778 --> 01:31:59.180
- He's a Jew.
- Shut up. You know this Nazi?

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:01.125
- He helped us.
- No, I don't know this dirty Jew.

01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:02.316
No, no...

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.790
- Get away, Jew.
- Hey. Hey!

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:06.254
Shut your mouth, Nazi.

01:32:06.287 --> 01:32:08.607
- No! No! No!
- Get out of here. Go home.

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:11.993
- No! Leave him alone!
- Go home!

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.361
No!

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:16.464
- Get off!
- Get out of here.

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:17.732
Go home!

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.181
Jojo?

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:37.518
Yorki!

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:41.456
Thank God.
I thought you were dead.

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:44.025
No. It seems like
I can never die.

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.527
I'm gonna go home
and see my mother.

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:48.863
I need a cuddle.

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:51.132
- Nothing makes sense anymore.
- Ja, I know.

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:53.435
It's definitely not
a good time to be a Nazi.

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:56.538
Hey. So now the war's over,

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:58.440
at least your girlfriend
will be free.

01:32:59.207 --> 01:33:00.374
She can leave now.

01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:03.245
Something wrong?

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:06.114
I've got to go.

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:07.382
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.284
Later!

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:02.203
Hi. I'm home.

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:04.072
What's going on out there?

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:10.312
- Out where?
- Outside, dummy.

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:13.215
Jojo, what's going on?

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:17.052
Is it safe to come out?

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:21.523
Jojo, is it safe?

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:24.459
Can I leave?

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:27.996
No.

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.602
You can't leave.

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:36.170
Why?

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:38.306
You have to stay here...

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:39.374
Who won?

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:41.509
with me.

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:43.511
Jojo, who won... who won the war?

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:49.017
We did.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.289
Germany won the war.

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:10.004
I-I'm sorry.

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.552
"Dear Elsa.

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.422
"I know it's hard for you
at the moment...

01:36:35.423 --> 01:36:37.292
"and I know
you feel like giving up.

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.161
"But you have to carry on.

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:42.730
"Me and your good friend, Jojo,

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:45.100
"have devised a plan
for you to escape.

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:48.069
"So, please listen to him.

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.439
"He's gonna help you
get out of there.

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.675
"And then you can
come live with me in Paris.

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:57.611
"And don't worry about Jojo.

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:02.650
"He'll be okay.

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:07.488
"See you in Paris.

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:08.556
Nathan."

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.734
- He's dead.
- Pardon?

01:37:20.468 --> 01:37:22.136
Nathan.

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:23.538
He died last year.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:26.141
Tuberculosis.

01:37:29.110 --> 01:37:32.380
Well... that's weird.

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:33.515
Who wrote these?

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:37.685
Thank you, Jojo.

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:43.223
You have been so good to me.

01:37:45.493 --> 01:37:49.830
Well, the thing is, I love you.

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:54.669
I know you think of me
as a younger brother, which is fine,

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:58.172
and, um, you're too old anyway.

01:37:58.205 --> 01:37:59.340
But...

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:02.444
Man, it's quite hot in here.

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.247
I love you, too.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.850
- As a younger brother.
- As a younger brother.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:12.854
Look, me and fake Nathan have found a way
for you to escape.

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:17.792
Maybe you can trust
a younger brother?

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:20.527
Maybe.

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:24.198
Okay, then.

01:38:24.231 --> 01:38:26.200
Get your things together.

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:27.268
We're leaving.

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:35.410
Jojo Betzler.

01:38:36.644 --> 01:38:38.313
Ten and a half years old.

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:40.647
Today,

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:43.383
just do what you can.

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:48.689
Where in the shit do you
think you're going, hmm?

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:51.425
- Out.
- Out? Oh, no, you don't.

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:53.326
No, we're gonna stay in here

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.563
and you're gonna tell me
exactly what's going on

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.298
with you and that thing
in the attic.

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:58.900
That "thing" is a girl.

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:01.169
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:39:01.202 --> 01:39:03.171
- Admit it.
- I just said yes.

01:39:03.204 --> 01:39:04.239
I knew it!

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:07.142
Well, it's never gonna work out.

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:10.912
No. No, she's too old for you.
And you're ugly.

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.948
You know she's gonna leave you.
You know that, don't you?

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:17.351
So, here's what's
gonna happen, you little shit.

You're gonna put this on, okay?

none of this ever happened.
