WEBVTT

01:18.119 --> 01:19.370
Hey, none of that.

01:20.955 --> 01:21.998
In your mouth, love.

01:26.544 --> 01:27.420
Oi.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.423
Looking at me this time, yeah?

01:38.556 --> 01:39.891
She pissed herself!

01:39.974 --> 01:42.060
-Now, that shit never gets old.
-Willa!

01:42.143 --> 01:43.061
Oh, my god.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.979
That was so good!

01:45.063 --> 01:46.105
Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.899
Oh, my god.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.150
That's disgusting.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.069
-Wow.
-Right?

01:56.032 --> 01:58.576
Well, they're my friends and they like it.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.454
Can't you find something
a little more cheerful?

02:01.538 --> 02:03.123
Cheerful? We've done all that.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.042
We went skiing on the Matterhorn,

02:06.126 --> 02:07.377
kitesurfing in Fiji.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.795
Oh, we did Dungeons & Dragons.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.380
I don't know what that is.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.756
It's a game, Agatha.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.092
It's a sweet, fun, boring fucking game.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.886
Oh, they want more.
They want something real, so...

02:18.471 --> 02:19.597
Well, this isn't real.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.059
Oh, I see.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.478
He's been ignoring you.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.230
That's why you're snooping around,
isn't it?

02:27.313 --> 02:28.314
I'm not snooping.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.900
I just came down here to see you,

02:31.025 --> 02:32.443
to see what you're getting up to.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.737
All he does is work, work, work, huh?

02:34.904 --> 02:36.072
Fucking boy scout.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.492
Have your fun, Thale.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.996
Just remember, they're not like us.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.166
Thanks, Mommy.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.043
I just,
I think I just like watching.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.004
-Yeah, I totally hear you. Same here.
-You know?

02:51.087 --> 02:52.088
All right, who's next?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.423
-I'll go!
-I'm in!

02:58.469 --> 03:02.348
D'Branin test log attempt 19
to communicate with the Volcryn.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.558
Recording.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.268
Initiate memory playback.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.525
D'Branin test log attempt 34.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.194
Connecting organics
from the Volcryn affected probe drives

03:15.278 --> 03:18.072
to the sphere core
to open communications with the Volcryn.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.075
Stop memory playback.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.368
Test failure.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.288
Attempt 55.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.625
Biometrics for activity patterns
or signs of communication.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.585
D'Branin. Initiate memory playback.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.214
Test failure.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.633
Stop memory playback.

03:37.675 --> 03:38.968
Attempt 71.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.931
I've increased probe matter integration
into memory sphere optical network

03:43.014 --> 03:44.641
based on data analysis.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.161
Test 79.

04:06.788 --> 04:11.376
Memory suite hybrid
with Volcryn affected probe drives.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.046
Begin test now.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.322
Shit.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.773
Chopping down the Terraform?

05:57.857 --> 05:59.067
Repurposing.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.861
Feels great to be working
with my hands again.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.988
We're getting close to the Volcryn,
we should be picking up

06:04.072 --> 06:06.616
-real-time data soon.
-Well, Karl must be pleased.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.203
Rowan, stop.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.457
I'm worried about our team, the mission.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.584
Why we came here?

06:17.835 --> 06:19.045
You know what they say,

06:19.796 --> 06:21.923
all work and no play.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.901
Hello, babes.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.655
And how's my little mama doing?

06:46.489 --> 06:47.615
Starving.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.533
Mm.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.827
Did you get me any
of those little snacky crackers?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.412
I did not.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.665
I will get them now, though.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.708
Oh, don't worry about it.
Stay here with me.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.461
Us.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.088
Mm.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.464
I'd love to.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.884
Mm. Our little bee is buzzing.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.681
What's that, little bee?

07:13.224 --> 07:14.350
Oh, it's yours, is it?

07:17.812 --> 07:18.813
Mm.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.249
What the hell was that?

07:39.417 --> 07:40.960
-You saw it, too?
-That was a vision.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.670
You're not supposed to be able to,
you can't...

07:42.753 --> 07:44.046
I don't know, Karl.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.507
I don't know. It's new.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.177
-But how do you...
-Please.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.303
I'm really scared.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.681
Agatha, L-3s take impressions, feelings,

07:53.764 --> 07:54.765
not...

07:55.933 --> 07:56.976
You can't do that.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.145
I've been...

08:01.272 --> 08:02.940
I've been taking suppressants

08:04.150 --> 08:05.485
for most of my life.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.113
Now, my regular dose
isn't working.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.201
Twice that dose isn't working.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.705
I don't know what to do.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.918
What about the chair?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.922
It's my greatest fear.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.884
That I'll be locked away for my telepathy.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.678
No. No. No, no, no.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.555
I'll never let that happen to you.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.182
-Okay?

08:37.350 --> 08:40.436
Says the man who looked like
he was just about to run away.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.190
But I didn't.

08:47.818 --> 08:48.653
Well.

08:48.736 --> 08:49.737
-No.
-No.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.531
-You didn't.
-No, I didn't.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.573
No.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.162
They're losing sight
of the big picture.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.207
We are days away from moving
into range of the Volcryn

09:01.290 --> 09:04.001
-and Rowan is off with Tessia...
-Preparing to be a father.

09:04.085 --> 09:08.339
He's a xeno-biologist
about to make contact with alien life.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.550
This is when we should be
at our most focused,

09:10.633 --> 09:11.926
and everyone is distracted.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.844
What about me

09:13.928 --> 09:15.888
I don't know, Roy. You seem more...

09:17.431 --> 09:19.350
thoughtful, reflective.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.769
I've been speaking with Agatha

09:21.852 --> 09:23.688
and she thinks I might break down
any second.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.315
She hasn't exactly been
acting normal either.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.400
Mm-mm.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.945
Am I changing?

09:31.445 --> 09:32.321
Hey.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.993
-You're still perfect.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.370
I'm serious!

09:39.453 --> 09:40.913
I've been naive before.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.208
I keep feeling like I'm missing something.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.169
What about Auggie?

09:48.963 --> 09:50.047
Still uptight.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.133
That much hasn't changed.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.551
-Maybe worse.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.511
And Lommie?

09:58.889 --> 09:59.849
I don't know.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.435
We don't talk.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.729
She moved out
of the mission lab months ago.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.064
Is she still keeping track
of our firewalls on the Crystal?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.942
You're not hearing Cynthia, are you?

10:10.026 --> 10:10.985
No. Nothing.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.321
But that doesn't mean
she's not trying to find a way out.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.072
If I know my mother, she'll never give up.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.365
Lommie won't let that happen.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.618
Are you sure we can trust her?

10:20.161 --> 10:21.412
She'll keep us safe.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.242
Downtown Dog, Lommie?

11:00.326 --> 11:02.286
Yes, please. And I'll have a lemonade.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.412
Okay.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.796
Downtown Dog, Lommie?

11:11.879 --> 11:14.173
Yes, and I'll have a milkshake today.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.132
Okay.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.389
Hey!

11:24.558 --> 11:25.643
Oh, yummy!

11:25.851 --> 11:27.728
Looks good.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.773
We would've ordered for you,
but I wasn't sure what you wanted.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.488
I'm sorry, I'm late.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.824
I had to run
some calculations for Karl.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.034
I don't like that Karl.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.829
Feels like he's lost track
of his priorities.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.164
Yeah, well, we've been out here
for a long time.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.624
Is that why you made us?

11:48.707 --> 11:50.209
-You're bored?
-Hey, watch that.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.753
We're all grateful
we can be together every day.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.964
Lommie did all that herself.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.383
She built all this.

12:00.970 --> 12:01.971
Ew.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.598
-Oh.
-Gross!

12:04.682 --> 12:05.724
What? No, that...

12:05.808 --> 12:07.852
-that can't happen.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.353
I didn't code it this way.

12:15.818 --> 12:16.819
Hold on.

12:26.954 --> 12:27.997
Hello?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.210
Hello?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.131
Hello?

12:40.968 --> 12:42.094
Who's there?

12:58.527 --> 13:00.571
Yeah, rally the troops,
I've got a great idea.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.489
What's that, mate?

13:01.572 --> 13:03.073
-Well, see, you're BASE jumping,
-Yeah.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.617
-from a big cliff,
-Uh-huh.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.660
-and you're falling, and you're falling.
-Right.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.454
And the ground is coming up to meet you.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.206
-And then your chute don't open.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.207
Splat. Done.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.209
-That's good. I like that.
-I thought it was good.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.419
Thale, hey. What are we doing next?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.213
-I'm the guinea pig, right?
-Yeah.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.257
You got to ease up, all right?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.218
I'm game for whatever you want.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.011
You got to wait like everyone else.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.931
Well, I need the rush, Thale.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.057
-You cannot be...
-Please.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.266
Willa.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.603
-Give the man some space.
-Okay.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.023
-We'll come get you when he's ready.
-Okay.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.237
-Sorry.
-Mm-hm.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.656
Here you go.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.287
So tell me, how are things
in your personal life?

13:50.871 --> 13:51.997
How is Mel?

13:52.289 --> 13:53.332
I adore Mel.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.169
She's everything I could ever want
in a partner.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.046
So caring,

13:59.547 --> 14:00.548
smart,

14:01.715 --> 14:02.841
authentic.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.011
But?

14:07.596 --> 14:08.722
But nothing.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.517
I just...

14:13.060 --> 14:14.144
I don't know,

14:15.896 --> 14:18.274
I worry she can't possibly really feel
the way I do.

14:19.858 --> 14:20.818
Why not?

14:23.028 --> 14:24.363
She doesn't really know me.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.034
We're just different.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.287
That's all.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.414
Mm.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.000
I mean, she's perfect.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.127
I could never measure up.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.212
Because of your mother.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.181
-Agatha?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.811
-Sorry. My head.
-Agatha? Hey.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.938
No, I'm okay. I, uh...

14:58.981 --> 15:01.400
I just... I...
We can pick this back up tomorrow.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.443
I need to go lay down.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.697
I'll have Tobis come check up on you.

15:10.826 --> 15:11.827
Lock.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.226
-Record.
-Recording.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.938
After the failure of test 79,

16:21.021 --> 16:24.650
I am reexamining original parts
of the probe

16:25.609 --> 16:28.278
in case I missed anything,
see if I could...

17:17.745 --> 17:18.746
It's them.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.029
-You okay?
-Yeah. Good.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.032
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.659
Okay.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.540
Oh, wow.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.168
Oh, it's so beautiful.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.087
It's quite the bundle.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.214
What Six pounds?

18:10.297 --> 18:12.257
That's correct, 2.7 kilograms.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.426
And the bub can hear us?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.387
Shall we test its auditory systems?

18:17.471 --> 18:18.680
Well, play some music?

18:20.224 --> 18:22.059
I'm interested in the health of the child,

18:22.142 --> 18:25.729
not if it can tell the difference
between Beethoven and Mozart.

18:28.023 --> 18:32.152
Well, it'd just be nice to get
some empirical data on our baby genius.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.320
Rowan, honey.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.447
Let's let Tobis do her job, okay?

18:35.739 --> 18:37.574
It's his first time being a daddy.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.368
He's a little baby crazy.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.369
I see that.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.121
It's my first time, too.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.540
Our first time.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.459
Rowan.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.754
Karl, have a look
at the most remarkable image.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.090
I really need to talk to you
about something really important.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.134
Take a look, it's got my lips.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.760
It's okay. Go talk.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.679
Go with Karl.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.763
Rowan.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.599
I think the Volcryn
is trying to communicate with me.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.768
It was like an earthquake,
it all just started...

19:04.852 --> 19:05.686
Karl.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.604
You have to come down
the memory suite with me.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.606
-I did that. I did it for months.
-It's different.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.984
-It's different now.
-How

19:12.568 --> 19:13.944
The probe is alive again.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.116
Okay. I'll come down after the scan.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.075
Yes, thank you.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.952
-After the scan.
-Okay.

19:24.621 --> 19:25.914
Test 80.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.501
Incorporating newly-revived probe material
into memory sphere.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.008
Daddy?

20:24.431 --> 20:25.474
Skye.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.061
Can you see me?

20:30.395 --> 20:31.271
Yeah.

20:33.857 --> 20:34.775
Can you?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.290
-Answer.
-Rowan.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.669
Remember your theory about
how cells communicate in organic systems?

20:54.169 --> 20:55.212
Yeah, of course.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.547
I think that's what's happening
with the probe,

20:57.631 --> 20:59.716
now that we're getting closer
to the Volcryn.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.426
What

21:01.510 --> 21:03.136
Yes, I think
they're using my daughter

21:03.220 --> 21:04.429
to try and communicate with me.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.515
So, I need you to get down here
and help, okay?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.016
Yeah. All right. Just relax.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.476
I told you, I'm on my way.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.103
No, no, no. No, Rowan.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.939
-Now! We need to start...
-Hey, I said I'm on my way. Switch off.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.149
Oh, shit.

21:17.901 --> 21:18.902
Hello?

21:24.825 --> 21:25.909
Is anybody here?

21:43.176 --> 21:44.928
My code has been corrupted.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.809
Someone's in here with us.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.939
No.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.026
Did you miss me?

21:59.943 --> 22:01.028
You can't...

22:01.111 --> 22:02.321
How did you...

22:02.404 --> 22:04.281
Get out of that house?

22:04.531 --> 22:06.491
It was your fault, wasn't it?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.410
But you were the good part of her. I...

22:09.119 --> 22:10.370
I helped you! I...

22:10.454 --> 22:11.371
I let you be free.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.998
And I came back to thank you.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.374
No!

22:14.458 --> 22:15.375
Lommie.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.502
Lommie. Lommie. Lommie.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.882
Lommie.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.967
-Oh!

22:24.051 --> 22:25.093
Fuck.

22:25.802 --> 22:26.970
What?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.722
What, what

22:28.805 --> 22:30.307
I've been trying to wake you.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.310
We're approaching the Volcryn,
and you've been in there for hours.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.688
I thought you might...

22:37.564 --> 22:39.357
-I thought you might be...
-What

22:45.447 --> 22:46.531
Yeah.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.035
For a second in there, I thought I was.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.244
Can that happen?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.038
Can that happen?

22:53.705 --> 22:54.998
Hey, why would that happen?

22:57.667 --> 23:00.045
When you die inside the Crystal,
you're gone.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.005
There's nothing left to go in the body.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.466
Why would you die
inside the Crystal, Lommie?

23:05.300 --> 23:06.468
Lommie!

23:09.930 --> 23:11.598
Are the firewalls still holding?

23:12.599 --> 23:14.851
We're still safe, right?

23:15.143 --> 23:16.186
Yeah.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.729
Yeah, I'm working on it.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.033
-Are you still having cravings?
-No.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.910
Thale, it's good to see you.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.662
Look at that belly.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.038
You look like a balloon.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.790
Come sit with us for a little while.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.875
I thought this was a date.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.877
Mm. It's fine. Don't be a grump.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.795
Come.

23:42.838 --> 23:43.839
Sit.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.882
Where's your gang of adventurers?

23:45.966 --> 23:47.384
Probably looking for me, mate.

23:47.467 --> 23:48.468
They never leave me alone.

23:49.010 --> 23:49.886
Well...

23:49.970 --> 23:51.429
Can you hear the baby's voice?

23:55.684 --> 23:56.726
I don't know.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.070
What?

24:08.363 --> 24:10.365
What is it

24:10.448 --> 24:11.908
Oh, nothing, um...

24:11.992 --> 24:13.660
I've been getting these, uh...

24:13.743 --> 24:15.453
these flashes, recently.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.621
Um...

24:17.539 --> 24:18.999
Thale, stop. What did you hear?

24:21.668 --> 24:22.794
It was like the bees.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.256
Millions of tiny voices.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.598
All right, thank you, Thale.
That's quite enough.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.018
I'm sorry.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.060
Sorry?

24:39.644 --> 24:41.146
Sorry for what?

24:41.229 --> 24:42.189
Thale?

24:43.440 --> 24:45.025
Please, Mel. I need to think.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.067
Wait.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.236
Wait. Wait a second!

24:49.946 --> 24:51.364
What is going on?

24:54.534 --> 24:57.162
I built a world in there,

24:57.245 --> 24:59.748
a place where I could be safe.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.082
Inside the Crystal Matrix?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.168
Why would you do that?

25:06.213 --> 25:07.214
Because...

25:09.049 --> 25:11.301
I hate my world out here.

25:16.389 --> 25:19.059
I fucked up, Lommie.

25:20.227 --> 25:22.270
But you have to believe me,
I never meant to hurt you.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.606
I should have been more careful
with your feelings.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.149
-Mel, it's not about you.
-I'm sorry.

25:26.900 --> 25:30.070
I may have made a really big mistake.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.114
I don't know.
I have to figure out a way to fix it.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.282
Let me help you.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.243
No.

25:39.287 --> 25:40.830
I need to do it myself.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.058
Test 81.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.477
I've increased the amount
of probe material.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.689
Attempting to reestablish contact
with Skye.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.675
You came back.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.390
How are you here?

26:42.726 --> 26:43.977
Where are we?

26:44.060 --> 26:46.646
I was in my room, but...

26:48.565 --> 26:50.108
Are you a ghost?

26:50.358 --> 26:51.401
No.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.861
No, baby.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.115
I'm right here.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.909
But you left us.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.704
On your trip,
and then you never came home.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.123
Oh, what trip, honey?

27:05.415 --> 27:06.583
The Nightflyer.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.169
No, Skye.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.715
When I left on the Nightflyer,

27:15.342 --> 27:18.261
-you were gone.
-No, I was never gone.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.263
I was here with Mommy.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.307
You were the one who left.

27:22.849 --> 27:24.142
No, Skye.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.519
You got sick. Remember?

27:27.103 --> 27:29.105
No, Daddy. I never got sick.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.443
No, Skye, the celio-virus.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.988
-When it came through...
-Mommy took me to Aunt Janey's, remember?

27:37.697 --> 27:38.990
You had to keep working.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.703
Did you die, Daddy

27:43.787 --> 27:46.456
Skye. Please, stop. Please.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.335
When are you coming home?

28:07.936 --> 28:10.772
Soon, baby, soon. I promise.

28:45.014 --> 28:45.974
You were right.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.436
We're all just cells communicating
to each other.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.274
You integrated the probe
into the memory suite?

28:54.607 --> 28:56.192
The Volcryn made the probe different.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.611
Memory suite's special now.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.407
How so?

29:02.532 --> 29:03.533
Well, all our memories,

29:03.616 --> 29:04.993
they exist within us,

29:05.452 --> 29:06.703
but they're a closed loop.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.705
With this,
we can reach out beyond them.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.957
We can talk to the Volcryn now.

29:11.916 --> 29:12.917
To anybody,

29:14.294 --> 29:15.295
to the dead.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.508
Karl, I know you're very upset.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.760
What are you talking about?

29:22.093 --> 29:23.178
With me.

29:24.554 --> 29:25.722
With the baby.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.807
It must be very difficult for you.

29:27.932 --> 29:28.933
For me

29:29.768 --> 29:31.352
With what you went through with Skye.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.773
I don't want any bad blood
between us, Karl.

29:34.856 --> 29:35.940
I came here to help you.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.486
I'm not the one who decided
to completely abandon the mission.

29:39.569 --> 29:41.863
I didn't decide to ignore protocol

29:41.946 --> 29:43.364
-and just because I...
-Wait.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.241
-...have broken through here...
-What protocol?

29:46.159 --> 29:47.827
Rowan, what's really important right now

29:47.911 --> 29:50.163
is that we can use this
to talk to the Volcryn,

29:50.246 --> 29:51.915
-talk to anyone...
-What protocol?

29:51.998 --> 29:52.999
We can refine this.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.959
If we can make this,
we can reach the Volcryn.

29:55.043 --> 29:58.838
What fucking protocol?

29:58.922 --> 30:01.549
Rowan, we can create
a whole new field of science...

30:01.633 --> 30:03.092
What fucking protocol?

30:04.177 --> 30:06.429
That all pregnancies in space
must be terminated.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.567
Do it yourself.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.660
-Oh!

30:40.213 --> 30:42.715
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.522
I love you.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.567
I love you so much, Murph.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.786
Why did you stop?

31:13.037 --> 31:14.038
Your face...

31:14.539 --> 31:15.456
Huh?

31:16.374 --> 31:17.292
What?

31:18.418 --> 31:19.419
No.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.005
No.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.007
No burns.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.383
We said no burns.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.594
No!

31:27.677 --> 31:28.970
-No not the burns.
-Keep going.

31:29.053 --> 31:29.971
Not the burns.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.764
-No.
-Please, Murph. I want to go back.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.558
It's not supposed to be you!

31:37.937 --> 31:39.063
Look at me.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.357
I protect you.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.944
I keep them away from you
when you want to be alone.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.279
You owe me!

31:48.489 --> 31:49.532
I want to go back.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.035
-I wanna go back like it was before.
-Get the fuck out of here.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.411
You lying little shit!

31:57.832 --> 31:59.417
Enough!

31:59.876 --> 32:01.502
-Stop!
-I can't!

32:01.586 --> 32:02.879
-Thale, stop.
-I can't.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.006
Stop, Thale! Stop!

32:23.441 --> 32:24.567
My hands!

32:24.651 --> 32:26.069
Where are my hands?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.166
Thale!

32:40.249 --> 32:41.876
Fuck.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.920
Thale, you can turn it off.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.129
You can filter it.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.881
I can't, it's too strong! I can't!

32:48.716 --> 32:50.426
-Shit.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.970
We're a fucking freak show

32:52.053 --> 32:53.471
-and nothing more.
-No.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.890
Fuck! Shit!

33:00.728 --> 33:02.313
Attention, crew.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.732
We are now within range of the Volcryn

33:04.816 --> 33:08.277
and experiencing concentrated waves
of Teke energy.

33:09.445 --> 33:13.950
All non-essential crew, please remain
in your quarters until further notice.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.869
Sorry, we woke you.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.663
We just want to check
if everything's okay.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.790
Off-cycle is supposed
to mean off-work.

33:20.873 --> 33:23.584
But new parents bring new priorities,
I suppose.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.838
Oh, nature doesn't always conform
to office hours.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.382
-I'm just a little nervous.
-Mm.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.217
-Thank you for doing this, Tobis.
-Uh-huh.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.808
We may need to reboot the machine.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.481
Oh, thank god.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.032
Uh...

33:54.115 --> 33:56.159
It's detecting
a cardiac abnormality.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.995
-Your child is in distress.
-What?

33:59.078 --> 34:01.456
Or there's something wrong
with the scanner?

34:01.956 --> 34:03.624
I'll do what I can to save it.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.376
What you can?

34:05.460 --> 34:08.212
On call Med Team to Bay Two, please.
This is an emergency.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.132
-What do you mean, what you can?
-We need to induce the birth right away.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.929
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. I'm right here.

34:30.651 --> 34:31.611
Well, they hate me.

34:32.820 --> 34:33.738
All of them.

34:35.323 --> 34:36.324
Don't come any closer.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.534
When you get closer, it gets stronger.
You feel it, too.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.328
Shit.

34:42.288 --> 34:44.373
My suppressives
are hardly working anymore.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.502
This energy we're feeling,
you can't suppress it.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.462
I don't know what to do.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.923
We should never have come out here.

34:52.006 --> 34:53.382
I want to help you.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.302
There's no helping us now.

34:58.846 --> 34:59.806
Get the oxygen, please.

34:59.889 --> 35:00.807
Yes, miss.

35:02.558 --> 35:04.185
The Pitocin is taking effect.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.522
-The baby is coming.
-It's too early.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.607
-It's too early.
-It's happening, Rowan,

35:09.690 --> 35:12.401
if you want to help, hold her down.
We don't have equipment for this.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.695
It's coming too fast.

35:15.363 --> 35:18.074
That's the synthetics working.
Just stay with me.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.660
There you go.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.411
I can see the head.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.541
Good, good, good. Just one more push.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.334
-You're doing it, baby.
-One more push...

35:29.085 --> 35:31.170
Push! Push!

35:39.470 --> 35:42.223
You did it, baby. You're amazing, darling.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.850
You're amazing.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.270
What is it?

35:47.353 --> 35:48.604
What's happening?

35:50.439 --> 35:52.024
Rowan, what's happening?

35:55.528 --> 35:56.863
What

35:59.365 --> 36:00.825
Oh, our baby.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.411
Oh.

36:06.914 --> 36:07.999
It's a girl.

36:10.793 --> 36:11.961
I'll call Captain Eris.

36:12.962 --> 36:13.880
Why?

36:15.339 --> 36:17.425
-What for?
-It's protocol.

36:19.218 --> 36:20.344
When there's a death.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.643
Can you hold her?

36:49.457 --> 36:51.125
Will you get the blanket we made?

37:38.381 --> 37:39.799
I'm just finishing up.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.351
Tess... Tess wants...

37:52.603 --> 37:54.105
Tess wants to bury...

37:55.815 --> 37:57.066
Skye in this.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.444
I don't understand.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.446
Skye.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.162
That's her name.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.835
Or was her name.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.131
Really?

38:21.465 --> 38:23.884
You're the reason that Tess and I met.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.471
We wanted to...

38:28.347 --> 38:32.601
We wanted to add something joyful
to the memory of your daughter.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.481
Oh, thank you, Rowan.

38:40.776 --> 38:41.861
I'm sorry.

38:45.781 --> 38:46.782
I really am.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.699
-Photos.

40:02.608 --> 40:04.068
Take the time you need.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.528
Okay?

40:06.654 --> 40:07.988
We're here for you.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.056
Quarantine.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.642
Quarantine, now!

40:36.725 --> 40:38.436
No! Tessia!

40:39.770 --> 40:41.021
Tessia!

40:43.107 --> 40:44.150
No!

40:44.233 --> 40:46.694
Tessia!
