10:38.271 --> 10:39.771
I don't want to be that person.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.339
Meaning you.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.441
Okay, Jennifer Lawrence
will be here any minute,

10:43.443 --> 10:45.010
and, Max, I have to say,

10:45.012 --> 10:47.112
I'm having
the best hair day ever.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.413
[wind blowing]

10:48.415 --> 10:51.683
I was having
the best hair day ever.

10:51.685 --> 10:55.153
Dude, Jennifer Lawrence took
a helicopter here.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.955
That is so baller.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.091
No, it's probably
the paparazzi following her.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.094
Leave us be!
We're just trying to live!

11:03.096 --> 11:04.696
This is the police!

11:04.698 --> 11:07.432
There is a dangerous criminal
in the area.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.435
We're looking
for Walter Gary Vance.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.137
Everyone, go inside.

11:12.139 --> 11:15.106
This entire area is on lockdown.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.877
No one will be allowed
to pass the roadblock.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.311
What're you doing?

11:20.313 --> 11:22.147
Uh, there's a serial killer
on the loose.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.848
I'm doing what all heroes do.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.051
I'm going on Twitter
to add to the chatter.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.887
Okay, I'm running to my cactus
to call J Law's people

11:28.889 --> 11:30.455
and make sure she doesn't
come out here.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.823
[gasps]
Stop!

11:31.825 --> 11:33.024
Don't go out there.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.392
According to Twitter,

11:34.394 --> 11:36.394
the murder is a cannibal,

11:36.396 --> 11:38.196
and also according
to Twitter,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.965
Khloé Kardashian is
feeling the burn.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.967
Oh, my God, a cannibal?

11:42.969 --> 11:44.302
We have to get inside.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.105
I have this terrible feeling
I'm delicious.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.810
So, here we are.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.078
Safe inside

11:53.080 --> 11:55.513
in a house made of glass

11:55.515 --> 11:57.148
on stilts

11:57.150 --> 12:00.919
in a city long overdue
for an earthquake.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.220
[both scream]

12:02.222 --> 12:04.355
[mouthing]

12:04.357 --> 12:05.857
Ah.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.259
We thought you were
a crazy murderer.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.095
I'm not crazy,
but I could just

12:10.097 --> 12:12.831
murder a cheese plate
right now.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.200
Oh, wow.

12:15.202 --> 12:19.237
The hills are so exclusive.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.339
I mean,
it's all blocked off.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.074
I haven't jumped
this many hurdles

12:23.076 --> 12:26.444
since the '84 Olympics.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.346
Sophie, what're you
doing here?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.248
Jennifer Lawrence's people
were trying to reach you,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.050
so they called the hotel,

12:32.052 --> 12:33.952
and to show you
some love and kindness,

12:33.954 --> 12:37.055
I came all the way here
to tell you.

12:37.057 --> 12:41.192
Yeah. Do you think
that will get me a baby?

12:41.194 --> 12:45.130
Not sure, but you can get a baby
for 80 bucks on the dark web.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.067
And it comes
with two outfits.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.369
What did
Jennifer's people say?

12:51.371 --> 12:54.339
I don't know.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.878
So, you just came up here
to tell me that they called,

12:59.880 --> 13:02.213
but you didn't,
like, listen to the words?

13:02.215 --> 13:05.183
Oh, it's never enough
for you, is it?

13:09.588 --> 13:12.423
[meditative chanting]
Ohm.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.893
Ohm.

13:14.895 --> 13:20.165
Ohm getting tired of meditating,

13:20.167 --> 13:24.002
but I think it's working.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.904
Ohm...

13:25.906 --> 13:27.939
Jennifer Lawrence is probably
freaking out

13:27.941 --> 13:29.407
that she can't get to me.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.343
The world doesn't revolve
around you, bitch.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.580
Ohm...ohm.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.248
I can't just
stand here anymore.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.950
I'm going outside
to get a signal.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.351
You know what else
you can get outside?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.287
Ya face eaten.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.589
Well, I'm gonna go risk
the life I have

13:44.591 --> 13:46.291
to go get the life I want.

13:46.293 --> 13:50.128
Sounds like a trailer
for a Liam Neeson movie.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.597
<i>(Television)</i>
<i>Finding Liam Neeson.</i>

13:52.599 --> 13:54.599
Good luck.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.036
That guys been taken more times
than my virginities.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.139
All right, I got a signal

14:01.141 --> 14:03.107
and a warning growl
from a coyote,

14:03.109 --> 14:04.943
but I talked
to Jennifer Lawrence's people,

14:04.945 --> 14:07.045
and she and I are gonna
FaceTime in 20 minutes.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.280
If you still have a face.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.882
Where's Bruno?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.450
Maybe he's back there
in the sauna

14:12.452 --> 14:13.952
like a little hotdog.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.186
[chuckles]

14:15.188 --> 14:17.522
Where's my big boy?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.657
Um, seriously,
where's my big boy?

14:19.659 --> 14:22.393
You didn't leave
the door open, did you?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.295
No.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.464
I'm sure he's in here somewhere.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.666
together:
Bruno? Bruno?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.201
Bruno?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.636
Bruno?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.472
<i>(Television)</i>
<i>Finding "Bruno."</i>

14:37.176 --> 14:39.377
Max, I'm really sorry.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.979
Maybe we could replace the dog

14:40.981 --> 14:42.513
with one that
looks exactly the same.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.383
Like men here do with wives.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.219
Or maybe we don't assume
he's dead after six seconds

14:48.221 --> 14:49.487
and we go out there
and find him.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.089
Okay, good luck.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.358
[scoffs]
You are coming with me.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.159
Randy loves Bruno,

14:55.161 --> 14:58.229
and I lo-uh-ike Randy.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.332
Don't think I didn't hear
what you almost said.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.269
- We need to find the dog.
- But it's getting dark

15:04.271 --> 15:06.204
and there's someone out there
who wants to kill us.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.940
Trust me, there's someone
in there who wants to kill you.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.942
Flashlights.
We need flashlights.

15:10.944 --> 15:14.345
You lo-uh-ike him.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.515
Now there are two people in here
who want to kill you.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.556
Come here, big boy.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.892
God, how could he have gotten
this far on such little legs?

15:27.894 --> 15:31.529
I don't know, Danny DeVito
seems to get around a lot.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.432
Even when you tell Randy
this is 100% your fault,

15:34.434 --> 15:36.534
he is still gonna
break up with me.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.536
Max, you've been with him
four days.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.039
I know, it's my
longest relationship.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.775
I'm really sorry, Max.
We'll find him.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.543
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

15:45.545 --> 15:48.546
- What, you see Bruno?
- No, I see bars on my phone.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.714
We have to stay right here.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.049
It's almost time
for my FaceTime.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.750
Give me that stupid thing.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.385
I'll put it down my pants.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.555
And I'll go get it.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.391
- [gasps and strains]
- You gotta focus

16:00.393 --> 16:01.793
and help me find that dog.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.661
I don't want
to ruin things with Randy

16:03.663 --> 16:04.896
or his house.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.765
Max, this is
so far past boundaries.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.767
Oh, don't talk to me
about boundaries.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.769
Who let the dog out?
Who?

16:11.771 --> 16:14.572
Who-who-who-who?

16:14.574 --> 16:18.109
As I said to Kevin Burlington
my sophomore year of college,

16:18.111 --> 16:20.611
"Just take it."

16:20.613 --> 16:21.946
This is serious.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.415
Randy has given me so much.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.684
Sunglasses, gift baskets,

16:26.686 --> 16:28.753
an orgasm with eye contact.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.989
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.992
Usually, I have
to push their face away.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.593
No, look.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.129
We're at the foot
of the Hollywood sign.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.530
Quick selfie?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.966
I mean, we have to, right?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.702
On the way back,
once we find the dog.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.037
Which we are definitely
going to do.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.538
[cell phone rings]

16:47.540 --> 16:50.408
[gasps]
Jennifer Lawrence is calling.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.113
Did you just hang up
on J Law?

16:55.115 --> 16:58.449
I'm pretty sure that's
against the J Law.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.819
You're out here
because you lost Randy's dog,

17:01.821 --> 17:03.388
and there's a strange man
standing over there,

17:03.390 --> 17:05.390
and all you can think about
is Jennifer Lawrence.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.393
Did you just say there's a
strange man standing over there?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.628
Oh, my God, I did.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.963
- Look...
- [gasps]

17:11.965 --> 17:13.631
See there, the old guy
in the stained sweat suit.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.900
Oh, he must be Randy's neighbor.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.469
What's he doing out here?

17:18.471 --> 17:21.706
[gasps]
Oh, you found Bruno!

17:21.708 --> 17:23.074
It's so funny, for a second

17:23.076 --> 17:24.475
I thought he was
the cannibal murderer.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.610
[laughs]

17:27.713 --> 17:29.814
(Caroline)
Oh, my God, he has a knife.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.016
Maybe he's just
opening packages.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.818
Come here.
Come here, big boy.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.820
- Uh...run, Max!
- Come here, big boy.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.423
- Come on.
- Nothing to eat here.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.991
I'm stringy and chewy.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.159
(Max)
Quick!

17:41.161 --> 17:42.593
Quick, up here!

17:42.595 --> 17:44.162
Maybe the helicopters
will see us.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.763
Yeah, and if not,

17:45.765 --> 17:47.698
we can throw ourselves
off the O.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.034
I refuse to get eaten
by an old man...

17:50.036 --> 17:52.437
without a bank account.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.505
Can cannibals climb?

17:54.507 --> 17:58.042
Well, they're not called
"climbables," so that's good.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.610
Is he still there?

17:59.612 --> 18:00.945
Well, we'll know in a second

18:00.947 --> 18:02.547
'cause you're screaming
within earshot

18:02.549 --> 18:03.948
of a hungry people-eater.

18:03.950 --> 18:07.585
You are surrounded!
Put your hands up!

18:08.620 --> 18:09.954
[both yelp]

18:13.092 --> 18:14.759
Max, the police are here.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.527
We're safe.
We're safe.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.929
Speak for yourself.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.632
I'm technically under
house arrest in Connecticut.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.041
I let him eat ice cream.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.542
He deserves it.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.145
Who had a rough day yesterday?

18:34.147 --> 18:36.914
I am really sorry, Randy.

18:36.916 --> 18:40.585
You must think I'm as
irresponsible as I am.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.220
This is where you cry

18:42.222 --> 18:45.123
and tell him it's all you
and I'm perfect.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.757
Sorry, I was just thinking,

18:46.759 --> 18:50.261
that dogs gums and teeth
look healthier than mine.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.963
- I still can't believe
my neighbor

18:51.965 --> 18:53.965
was Walter Gary Vance
the cannibal.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.969
And honestly, it was way worse
living next to Courtney Love.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.137
I mean, it's not that hard.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.905
Blue bins are for recycling,

19:00.907 --> 19:02.240
Tuesdays are street cleaning,

19:02.242 --> 19:05.243
Don't do heroin on my porch.

19:05.245 --> 19:08.579
Yeah, that's
a driveway sport.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.750
Look, Bruno's
gotten out before,

19:12.752 --> 19:15.186
but the fact that you
went out there to look for him

19:15.188 --> 19:16.587
and risked your lives.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.923
I mean, you were fearless.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.226
Pfft, whatever.
Maybe a little.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.032
Ugh, great.
Jennifer Lawrence just passed.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.135
She's dead?

19:31.137 --> 19:33.604
No, she passed on the movie.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.606
It's her loss.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.608
Well, it's your loss,
but I feel like I owe you

19:37.610 --> 19:39.777
for risking your life
to find my boyfriend's dog.

19:39.779 --> 19:43.181
Not that
you're my boyfriend,

19:43.183 --> 19:45.950
'cause gross.

19:45.952 --> 19:49.053
I'd be lucky
to be your boyfriend.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.889
If I was, which yuck,
I'm not.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.293
Hey, everybody.

19:55.295 --> 19:59.897
Look,
I'm spiritually evolved now.

19:59.899 --> 20:03.634
Yeah, you know, the meditating
was screwing up my knees,

20:03.636 --> 20:05.336
so I bought this getup
from an Indian woman

20:05.338 --> 20:06.837
at a bus stop.

20:06.839 --> 20:10.174
Yeah, it's a lot easier.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.343
Sophie, those flowers
are beautiful.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.312
Yeah...

20:14.314 --> 20:17.215
and they're for you.

20:19.818 --> 20:22.153
What're they gonna do to me?

20:23.855 --> 20:26.991
They're an act of love
and kindness.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.726
Sophie, that's literally

20:28.728 --> 20:30.761
the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.096
Oh, yeah.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.332
I don't know
if it's my aura's clean,

20:34.334 --> 20:37.168
or it's the 12.95 Bindi dot
I'm wearing,

20:37.170 --> 20:39.237
but I really do mean it.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.172
Oh, Sophie, no.
That's dog ice cream.

20:41.174 --> 20:43.241
Mind your own business, bitch!

20:46.211 --> 20:48.412
And we're back.
