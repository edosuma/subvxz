WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.720
[indistinct chatter]

00:11.680 --> 00:14.560
[Pigsy] Damage from the demon attack
is as follows...

00:14.640 --> 00:17.760
The tavern took a battering.
Six doors to be replaced.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.520
John's Grain and Haberdashery is a mess.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.160
And four monks killed.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.120
Just the monks who copped it?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.640
Well, count that as a blessing.
My charity can only stretch so far.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.200
Now tell me, who is this demon
and what does it want?

00:32.280 --> 00:34.040
-A crown.
-A crown?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.080
Old school.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.920
Whose crown?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.720
I don't know, but I've never seen
a sentinel like this before.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.760
[Locke] I need you to find out
exactly who's behind this

00:43.840 --> 00:46.240
and how much they'll pay for it,
and quickly.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.760
I can't have demon sentinels
waltzing in from the Barren Lands

00:48.840 --> 00:49.960
whenever they feel like it.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.600
You ever seen
frightened people try to work?

00:52.680 --> 00:55.120
I can't have it. I won't have it.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.800
We need to sort this out, my sweets.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.360
Will you do that for me?

00:59.440 --> 01:00.600
Of course.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.240
-What else will you do for me?
-Foot tickle?

01:03.320 --> 01:04.640
You know it.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.800
Hmm. Where am I?

01:33.560 --> 01:34.720
What is this place?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.320
We're just outside the town of Palawa.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.160
The edge of nowhere.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.880
I'll take it from here.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.480
A gift.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.960
-I'm not sure what I should--
-For your monastery.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.600
To thank you for releasing me
and keeping my staff safe.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.400
[whistles and clicks tongue]

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
Hmm.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.080
[whistles and clicks tongue]

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
Strange.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.440
Are you summoning your cloud?
We thought it might be a myth.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.000
What are you still doing here?

02:15.560 --> 02:18.920
Uh, well, we have many matters to discuss.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.520
We are now to retrieve
the sacred scrolls and journey west.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.200
You will, uh... You are to protect me
and be my guide.

02:26.760 --> 02:27.840
Says who?

02:28.680 --> 02:30.360
That is why we released you.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.520
"We"?

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
Who is "we"?

02:37.080 --> 02:38.280
I'm Tripitaka.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.000
Does that name mean anything to you?

02:42.560 --> 02:44.040
No. Never heard of you.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.200
[Tripitaka] Monkey, you must be careful.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.440
There's many who don't want
you back in the world.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.960
Many what? Be more specific.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.560
Many demons. You fought that one,
but there will be more.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.720
-How many?
-A lot.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.200
They rule the world now.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
Interesting.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.040
Monkey, I have to tell you something.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.800
You've been trapped in that rock
for quite a long time.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.840
So I gather.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
How long?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
[clears throat]

03:15.400 --> 03:16.480
Five hundred years.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.320
-[yells] What?
-[birds caw]

03:24.240 --> 03:25.080
[indistinct chatter]

03:25.160 --> 03:27.440
[Tripitaka] I'm sorry, Monkey.
I thought you would know more.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.600
[sighs] What is this?

03:30.360 --> 03:31.640
-[grunts]
-It's your crown.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.440
It's what released you from the stone.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.880
Why won't it come off?

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
Nice outfit.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.840
[Monkey] Hmm.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.240
You look familiar.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.040
Monks usually beg outside,
so this is novel.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.720
You got money to pay for this?

03:51.560 --> 03:52.560
Of course.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.920
Well, let me know
if you need anything, all right?

04:00.920 --> 04:02.600
For hundreds of years,

04:02.680 --> 04:06.560
the demons have ruled
under a cloud of chaos and confusion,

04:06.640 --> 04:09.680
passing off the legends of the gods
as myth and hearsay.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.920
-Hmm.
-My master, the scholar,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.840
he taught me the truth.
He was part of a resistance movement.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.079
Our mission
was to release you from the stone,

04:18.160 --> 04:20.399
find the sacred scrolls and journey west.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.079
Why? What's there?

04:23.440 --> 04:26.800
Well, I believe
that's where the resistance is based.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.760
But first, we must find the scrolls.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.960
There is great magic
contained within them.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.080
Only with the scrolls can we overcome
the darkness that suppresses us--

04:35.160 --> 04:36.960
Another bowl over here!

04:37.040 --> 04:38.960
I don't understand.

04:39.040 --> 04:39.920
[smacks lips] What?

04:40.600 --> 04:43.200
[sighs] People have given their lives
for this cause,

04:43.280 --> 04:44.760
and you're not even listening to me.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.680
Are you not interested
in saving the world?

04:47.760 --> 04:50.040
I'll do as I please, okay?

04:50.120 --> 04:52.880
Not what others tell me to do.
I only take orders from gods.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.880
And even then,
only if I think it's a good idea.

04:58.440 --> 04:59.920
Please. [sighs]

05:00.000 --> 05:01.840
Wait here. Eat some more.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.880
I will return with answers.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.160
And whatever you do,
try keep a low profile, okay?

05:27.240 --> 05:28.240
What happened?

05:33.040 --> 05:35.120
The demon killed four of our young monks.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.960
The demon that was looking for you.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.160
I'm deeply sorry.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.280
But... perhaps their deaths
were not in vain.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.160
Do you know of the Monkey King?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.920
Trapped by demons for 500 years?

05:57.960 --> 06:00.360
Well... he has been released.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.680
What I mean to say is I have released him.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.000
He's here to restore light to the world.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.720
He gave me this.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.480
You've done what?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.520
[grunts and sighs]

06:23.000 --> 06:25.080
-[straining]
-[man grunts]

06:26.880 --> 06:28.480
[whistling]

06:31.480 --> 06:33.320
[grunting]

06:42.320 --> 06:43.320
[grunts]

06:49.080 --> 06:51.920
Please, accept my apologies.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
[scoffs]

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
[sighs]

06:57.320 --> 06:58.800
[all chuckle]

07:02.120 --> 07:03.480
Apology accepted.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Not the hair.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.800
Never the hair.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.000
[all grunting]

07:22.120 --> 07:23.440
[groans]

07:25.800 --> 07:27.400
[grunting continues]

07:36.480 --> 07:37.560
[slurps] Hmm.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.680
[all grunting]

08:08.680 --> 08:09.560
[screams]

08:12.120 --> 08:13.120
Yes!

08:13.640 --> 08:14.680
My powers have rest--

08:14.760 --> 08:15.920
[all grunting]

08:34.960 --> 08:36.039
Darker one.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.840
[patron] I have information
for Princess Locke.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.120
Thank you, ma'am. I thought you might like
to know there's a demon in the tavern.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.840
He just took out five mercenaries
without even drawing a weapon.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.160
Did he have strange writing on his face?
Was he scary-looking?

08:53.240 --> 08:55.040
Well, no, he wasn't scary-looking at all.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.720
He was...
He was kind of handsome, actually.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.680
Here.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.080
Centuries ago, the Monkey King
killed one of the ancient gods

09:10.160 --> 09:12.400
and stole the sacred scrolls.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.160
It was the gods, not the demons,

09:14.240 --> 09:17.600
that placed Monkey in stone to protect
the world from his furious power.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.120
But the scholar...

09:20.680 --> 09:24.240
He taught me that Monkey
was our only hope to defeat the demons.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.240
-The scholar?
-You knew him?

09:27.240 --> 09:30.760
He was once part of our order,
when we were both much younger men.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.360
He developed some strange ideas.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.880
Went searching for answers
outside of our teaching.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.320
And where is he now?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.120
He's dead.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.040
I... I don't understand.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.280
He taught me so much.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.040
Why didn't he tell me the truth?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.680
Confusion and doubt.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.040
It means you're alive
and luckier than these young people.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.000
Don't waste it on the Monkey King.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.040
[Pigsy] And you have absolutely no idea
of where he's gone now?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.600
[Monica] Well, your guess
is as good as mine.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.840
He ripped this place to pieces,
and just bolted out of here.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.840
Was he with anyone?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.160
[sighs]

10:29.560 --> 10:30.920
No, he was alone.

10:34.160 --> 10:38.000
Well, if you do see or hear anything,
let me know.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.760
Will do, boss.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.720
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

11:05.760 --> 11:09.680
[Tripitaka] Everything I've known,
everything I've been led to believe,

11:10.320 --> 11:12.120
none of it's true.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.120
How can I go forward
when I don't even know what's in the past?

11:16.200 --> 11:18.120
How can I know who to trust?

11:18.760 --> 11:21.480
[boy] Hey, you! What you up to?

11:21.560 --> 11:23.040
Uh, nothing.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.520
They say you shouldn't be
on the streets at night.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.800
There's a demon in town.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.960
Oh, you're from the monastery.
They lock the gates at sunset.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
You missed your tea?

11:32.840 --> 11:35.000
-I'm not sure I should--
-Wait a sec.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.520
[footsteps descending]

11:41.720 --> 11:43.200
[door opens]

11:45.880 --> 11:48.440
I couldn't finish my sandwich.
Here you go.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.560
Thank you. That's very kind.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.520
You got a place to sleep?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.640
You could stay at my place.
I could ask my mum.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.440
-I'm Zeek.
-Mmm. I'm Tripitaka.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.720
-[gasps]
-What is it?

12:06.080 --> 12:08.040
-[grunts]
-[Zeek] Ahh!

12:08.920 --> 12:09.960
[Tripitaka panting]

12:12.800 --> 12:14.080
[gasps] Hey!

12:17.000 --> 12:18.360
Zeek! [panting]

12:25.240 --> 12:26.720
[Monkey] Hey, monk boy.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.520
Monkey...

12:30.240 --> 12:31.880
I thought we were keeping a low profile.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.320
I was trying to help a boy.
There was a demon--

12:35.400 --> 12:36.400
Uh-huh.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
Not that I expect you to care.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.400
I went to the monastery
hoping to find answers,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.360
and all that I found
was that you were a criminal.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.160
You killed a god,
and you stole the scrolls for yourself.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.080
To every story,
there is more than one telling.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.120
So...

12:59.680 --> 13:01.240
what is your story?

13:03.680 --> 13:04.960
It is yet to be written.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.880
-Where are you going?
-To find an old friend.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.400
-Where are the scrolls?
-Safe!

13:10.480 --> 13:11.560
[Tripitaka screams]

13:18.640 --> 13:19.720
[sighs]

13:22.680 --> 13:24.680
[metal grinding]

13:33.880 --> 13:34.880
Ow.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.600
[Sandy] It was only a little whack.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.800
Could have done it harder,

13:39.880 --> 13:43.760
but taking in your size,
I didn't want to go over the top.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.720
[panting] Where is the boy?

13:52.800 --> 13:54.280
I wasn't chasing a boy.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.920
Oh... [chuckles]

13:59.480 --> 14:01.400
See what he thinks. [sighs]

14:01.480 --> 14:03.680
Well, understandable. Sure.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.760
But here we go.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.720
Stranger arrives,
brings all sorts of trouble.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.800
-Who are you?
-I'm no one.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.000
I'm just a monk.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.800
Really?

14:17.840 --> 14:19.440
You know what I think?

14:21.640 --> 14:23.280
I think you're a liar.

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
[Monkey clears throat]

14:28.440 --> 14:29.440
[Monica] You again?

14:29.520 --> 14:31.880
-We're shut.
-I need your help.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.000
-Really?
-Hmm.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.760
Well, uh, I need some new chairs,
half a dozen plates and some new shoes.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.000
[sighs]

14:42.640 --> 14:43.960
It's 500 years old.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.480
I saw your altar out the back.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.200
I remember a time when everyone had one.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.680
Well, if you remember those days,
then you must be--

14:53.760 --> 14:56.280
A god. I am.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.400
I need to know where I would find a demon

14:59.480 --> 15:03.560
who specializes in the abduction
of little boys and little boy monks.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.160
Who is this monk to you?

15:08.080 --> 15:09.360
That's what I need to find out.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.560
I'm going to ask you one more time.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.640
Who are you? And why are you here?

15:18.960 --> 15:22.520
[sighs and stammers] I'm an orphan.
I have no family, no home--

15:22.600 --> 15:24.080
You got a name, sad sack?

15:25.280 --> 15:27.280
[breathing heavily] Tripitaka.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.520
What did you just say?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.360
Tripitaka?

15:36.360 --> 15:39.040
[gasps] Tripitaka?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.160
[breathing heavily] You're Tripitaka!

15:42.360 --> 15:45.960
The scholar told me that one day
a monk named Tripitaka would appear,

15:46.040 --> 15:47.280
and I was to help him.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.160
-I was raised by the scholar.
-Of course you were.

15:51.680 --> 15:56.320
He was a visionary. A poet.
An architect of the resistance.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.280
[stammers] I don't understand.
You're a demon.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.720
No demon here. I am a god.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.080
I choose to live like this.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.160
-Do you know why?
-No. Why?

16:07.240 --> 16:10.120
No, that's what I'm asking.
I've entirely forgotten.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.680
But if you're a god,
what about the boy you were chasing?

16:13.760 --> 16:16.920
[sighs] That was no boy.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
[Zeek] Oi!

16:31.920 --> 16:34.040
I've been looking for you, Pig-man.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.600
[screams]

16:38.560 --> 16:41.760
[sighs] Oh, that was seriously wrong.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.960
Tell Locke there is good money to be made
for the capture of the Monkey King.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.640
Yep. Righto.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.080
[groans]

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
It's still good.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.680
Still good.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.840
[Sandy] I've been waiting a long time
for this moment, Tripitaka.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.640
I've written some poems about you.
They're not good or anything,

17:04.720 --> 17:07.079
but they do express
a certain sense of devotion.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.680
So you know of our mission?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.040
To find the sacred scrolls
and journey west.

17:12.119 --> 17:12.960
Shh.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.240
[clattering in the distance]

17:19.040 --> 17:20.240
-[softly] What is it?
-Shh.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.520
[blade scraping]

17:22.599 --> 17:25.560
Second least favorite thing. Company.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.520
[grunts]

17:32.560 --> 17:33.440
[Monkey grunts]

17:34.720 --> 17:36.720
-Monkey, wait!
-Silence, monk, I'm saving your life.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.080
[gasps]

17:38.160 --> 17:39.720
[grunting]

17:40.320 --> 17:42.360
Monkey, please!
You don't know what you're doing!

17:42.440 --> 17:44.240
-Relax, I've done this a million times!
-No!

17:45.280 --> 17:46.320
[Sandy choking]

17:47.120 --> 17:49.720
Your new name will be Tripitaka.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.200
[chanting] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.880
[Sandy grunting]

17:57.520 --> 18:00.040
[chanting] Na ninekah alookah enumbah
kudantai calaporeekah

18:01.040 --> 18:02.640
-[screaming]
-[chanting continues]

18:06.760 --> 18:08.200
[groaning]

18:08.920 --> 18:09.920
[sighs]

18:10.760 --> 18:11.840
[panting]

18:14.320 --> 18:15.560
What just happened?

18:16.360 --> 18:19.520
I had to stop you from killing her.
I'm sorry.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.920
-[sighs] But she's not a demon.
-[breathing heavily]

18:23.640 --> 18:24.680
Then what is she?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.120
[clattering above]

18:32.520 --> 18:34.560
Uh-oh. Time to move.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.080
Follow me. I can get us out of here.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.200
[sighs]

19:03.920 --> 19:04.760
[Monkey sighs]

19:05.720 --> 19:07.840
You could have told me
that you controlled the crown.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.720
I guess I don't have a choice
in any of this.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.400
Do I?

19:11.960 --> 19:15.200
You already made your choice.
That's why you came back to save me.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.040
[sighs]

19:19.120 --> 19:21.280
Dreadfully exciting, isn't it?

19:21.360 --> 19:24.800
The three of us,
journeying off together into the unknown.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.800
What are we supposed to call you?

19:27.360 --> 19:30.040
Well, it's been a while since
anyone's called me anything but...

19:30.600 --> 19:32.840
"Ew" or, "Get away from me."

19:33.680 --> 19:36.320
But I'm Sandy. My name is Sandy.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.720
There are seven scrolls
hidden in seven different continents.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.720
Without my cloud,
it would take years to retrieve them.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.240
Why don't you try calling it again?

19:48.120 --> 19:51.240
It's been 500 years.
Maybe you're just rusty.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.160
[sighs heavily]

20:00.920 --> 20:03.200
[whistling and clicking tongue]

20:03.280 --> 20:05.280
[thunder rumbling]

20:21.320 --> 20:22.320
Any minute now.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.560
[Pigsy] Ooh! Ahoy there, young travelers.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.720
It's a nasty night for a stroll.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.960
Well, why don't you jump in?
I can take you as far as the next town.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.440
But that's as far as I'll be going tonight
in this weather, I tell ya.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.800
[laughs]

21:02.320 --> 21:04.360
-[Pigsy] There we go.
-[Tripitaka sighs] Thank you.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.000
I've counted those radishes, young man,
so I'll know if you've been nibbling.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.240
Just sit where you can.
Don't mind the vegetables.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.360
Might even see my prized pomegranate.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.240
[chuckles]

21:20.160 --> 21:22.400
Sit tight. This won't take long.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
Hee-yah!

21:39.960 --> 21:41.960
[theme music playing]
