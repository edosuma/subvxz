[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.441 --> 00:09.710
I know you made it clear you
only want to be buddies, but...

00:09.743 --> 00:11.979
...I was just wondering if you
ever think you might change your
mind.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.316
I just don't see it. You know
how focused I am on my goal.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.718
If you want a more physical
game, then I want to go legit.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.454
No more kissy kissy
until we go on a date.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.456
I was presented with
clear evidence

00:22.490 --> 00:23.691
of inappropriate conduct.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.130
The spot on the World
Team goes to Kaylie Cruz.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.765
You literally cannot afford to
share the spotlight with this
girl.

00:31.799 --> 00:35.703
I'll do whatever it takes to
make sure Kaylie's out of the
picture.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.042
[The DNC Feelin' Good
(Ooh la la) playing]

00:45.513 --> 00:47.348
[camera shutter]

00:47.381 --> 00:48.782
Wait'll you check out
the swag bags

00:48.816 --> 00:51.252
we have for everyone at our
Worlds send-off party.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.620
Too bad it's for
Rock members only.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.388
Too bad I couldn't care less.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.656
I never socialize
with the competition.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.526
Competition?
You're our teammate.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.194
You don't get the big
sponsorship bucks

01:00.228 --> 01:01.762
for winning team medals.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.497
The individual gold
is what makes you a star.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.498
Which is what I am.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.134
Kelly, can you
move to the back

01:06.167 --> 01:07.368
so that Kaylie
is front and center?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.569
You were saying?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.273
[Sheila] No, no, no.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.608
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi. Sheila Baboyan.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.678
Gentle reminder, my daughter
is current World Champ.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.680
[Marcus] And Kaylie Cruz
is the current National
Champion.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.283
I know. It's such
a shame, isn't it?

01:22.316 --> 01:24.418
She has so much potential,
that girl.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.288
Oh. I'm sure you've
heard the rumors about

01:27.321 --> 01:30.624
her eating disorder.
God bless her.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.626
The NGO doesn't
pay attention to rumors.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.495
Excuse me.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.131
Hey, camera lady.
Where is Kelly's key light?

01:37.165 --> 01:38.232
Her eyes are recessed.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.600
Come on, just give her
a little sparkle.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.834
Give her a little help there.
All right, do your job,

01:40.868 --> 01:41.835
and we'll be good.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.238
Who is that horrible woman?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.307
It's Kelly Parker's
"manamomster."

01:46.340 --> 01:50.711
Manager-slash-mother,
slash monster.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.681
She is the worst stage parent
I've ever seen in this sport.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.284
And all she cares
about is the money.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.720
It's shameful the way
she exploits her daughter.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.622
Well, that's why we've
never let Payson

02:01.655 --> 02:03.557
accept any sponsorship money.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.227
And we never will.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.362
And FYI,
the only reason you
won Worlds last year

02:08.396 --> 02:10.164
is because Russia and China
brought their "B" teams.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.166
Come on, Lo.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.635
Well it's true. She's never
beaten Ivanka or Genji Cho.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.103
Neither have you.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.339
And I'm betting that Ivanka
and Genji will dethrone

02:18.372 --> 02:20.708
the "Queen of the Beam"
again in Rio.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.610
Yeah, well Sasha thinks
I can win the gold on beam.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.379
Haven't you noticed
how much special attention
he's been giving me?

02:25.413 --> 02:27.515
No, but I do remember
how much his special attention

02:27.548 --> 02:29.283
did for Payson.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.586
Can everyone just shut up
and take the picture?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.688
Coach Belov, can you
join the girls, please?

02:38.626 --> 02:41.462
Girls, think you can stop
flapping your gums long enough
for us to shoot this?

02:41.495 --> 02:44.698
Sorry, Sasha.
I was just telling the girls
that because of you,

02:44.732 --> 02:46.634
I may get the gold on beam.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.942
[Speaking Portuguese]

02:59.647 --> 03:03.150
[chuckling] Sorry.
Sorry. One more.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.553
[Speaking Portuguese]

03:09.423 --> 03:11.425
[continues]

03:16.664 --> 03:17.698
[Payson] No.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.767
[woman]
Let's try that again, OK?

03:19.800 --> 03:20.768
[Payson] OK.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.371
[speaking Portuguese]

03:23.404 --> 03:25.273
Hopefully she can get this
by Worlds and not

03:25.306 --> 03:27.608
- the end of the world.
- Guess what I just heard?

03:27.641 --> 03:30.778
Healthy Bar is going
with Kaylie Cruz.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.947
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked to get
you that endorsement?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.584
And all you had to do was
to keep her off the team.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.353
I did my best coaching
Tessa for the spot.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.954
And, well, your best
wasn't good enough

03:40.988 --> 03:42.756
since you let Kaylie
beat you at Nationals.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.693
The only way to get her
off the team now

03:45.726 --> 03:47.528
is to expose
her anorexia.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.364
This sport cannot afford
another eating disorder scandal.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.899
We need some proof.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.270
Why don't you just
say it in English?

03:56.304 --> 03:58.639
Oh, OK.
[chuckling]

03:58.672 --> 04:01.975
Hello Rio, my name is Payson
Keeler and I'll see you at
Worlds.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.579
Great. Kelly,
we're ready for you.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.214
Just a second.
I've waited so long

04:07.247 --> 04:08.816
my lip gloss has
evaporated.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.864
Watch how a pro does it.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.766
[Sheila] Hey, camera guy,
Can you get in a little closer?

04:25.799 --> 04:26.734
is is the world champ,
all right?

04:26.767 --> 04:27.768
Is that gonna kill you?

04:29.737 --> 04:31.439
[speaking Portuguese]

04:36.544 --> 04:38.278
[continues]

04:45.486 --> 04:46.720
What's this?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.789
I believe it's
the original camcorder disc

04:48.822 --> 04:51.692
of Payson and Coach Belov's
training session.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.793
When she kissed him?

04:52.826 --> 04:56.364
And when, as the edited version
Ellen Beals received

04:56.397 --> 04:59.433
didn't show,
he clearly pushes her away.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.668
Where did you get that?

05:00.701 --> 05:01.935
It was sent to
the NGO anonymously.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.804
Why now?

05:03.837 --> 05:07.341
Maybe whoever took it
and cut it to incriminate
Sasha felt guilty.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.042
I wonder if we could keep
this under wraps.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.744
At least until after Worlds.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.415
Payson has so much
to worry about right now
without opening this wound.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.816
[Marcus] However you
want to handle it.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.419
So I'll see you in Rio.

05:18.452 --> 05:21.054
Actually, we have
to miss this one.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.724
That's too bad.
But, don't worry,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.493
we'll take good care
of Payson.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.997
So, are things
really that bad?

05:30.030 --> 05:34.001
We can't even pay our mortgage,
how can we go to Worlds?

05:34.034 --> 05:36.904
This thing is
postmarked Boulder.

05:36.937 --> 05:41.442
I swear if I ever find out who
tried to humiliate my daughter

05:41.475 --> 05:43.877
And nearly destroy
Sasha's career.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.513
I'll rip their heart out.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.914
Not if I beat you to it.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.718
[Sasha] Round off full, go.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.687
[up-beat music plays]

05:56.857 --> 05:59.627
Perfect. Back handspring
layout, layout, layout.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.767
Good.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.072
Freeze.
What did I tell you?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.675
Fierce not flirty.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.578
We want the judges in Rio to
take you as seriously as Ivanka
and Genji.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.579
OK?

06:18.612 --> 06:19.747
XXX Arabesque.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.782
Wow. Taking sexy
from Lauren is...

06:21.815 --> 06:23.551
Is like giving her
a lobotomy.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.519
There's nothing
left inside but air.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.620
[Kaylie snarls]

06:26.654 --> 06:27.688
Hey, gorgeous.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.056
Hey.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.661
Steady, stay focused.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.762
OK.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.599
[Sasha] Side aerial.
Kick front-flip.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.742
Good.
Standing Arabian.

06:57.818 --> 06:58.786
Good.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.754
Double back dismount.

07:09.630 --> 07:13.534
That's OK. We've loaded your
routine with a lot of skills.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.736
What if it's still not good
enough to beat Ivanka and Genji?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.437
You need to forget
about the past.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.740
All great competitors
have one thing in common:

07:19.773 --> 07:22.510
A short term memory.
They aren't haunted by
their losses or their mistakes,

07:22.543 --> 07:23.644
because they
don't remember them.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.847
A short memory.
That's what you
need to win. Got it?

07:26.880 --> 07:27.948
Yeah.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.617
Hey.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.120
You and I, we've had
a break through, right?

07:34.955 --> 07:38.058
- Right.
- So trust me.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.194
[sighing] I do.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.563
I trust you.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.064
I trust you, too.

07:51.839 --> 07:55.208
[theme music playing]

08:17.698 --> 08:19.900
[speaking Spanish]

08:22.670 --> 08:24.738
[speaking Spanish]

08:27.107 --> 08:29.109
[responding in Spanish]

08:30.778 --> 08:32.279
[continues in Spanish]

08:35.816 --> 08:37.985
- Do you speak Spanish?
- I do.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.754
What did Kaylie just
say about me?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.723
That you should be
the team captain

08:42.756 --> 08:44.057
because you're the
current World Champ

08:44.091 --> 08:46.059
and you've won more gold medals
than anyone else.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.595
Why would she say that?

08:47.628 --> 08:50.764
Because she's a team player

08:50.798 --> 08:51.932
and a class act.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.640
We're prepared to
offer you $250,000

08:59.673 --> 09:03.076
against 500,000
if Kaylie medals at Worlds.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.614
And then of course there are
the big bonuses based on sales.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.915
How does that sound?

09:07.948 --> 09:12.820
[sighing] It sounds like
What's the product?

09:12.853 --> 09:14.888
A new energy bar for
the fit young woman

09:14.922 --> 09:16.690
who cares about her health.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.892
You're not just the National
Champion of gymnastics,

09:18.926 --> 09:22.029
but also of good nutrition
and positive body esteem.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.164
You're the perfect role model
for young girls.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.900
You would never starve yourself
to get the results you want.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.703
Which is why,
when Kaylie Cruz needs energy

09:29.737 --> 09:33.774
she grabs a Grrrl Bar.
G triple r l.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.942
[whispering] Grrrl.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.144
- [chuckling]
- [woman] What do you think?

09:37.177 --> 09:41.081
Uh, I think we need to talk
it over and we'll get back
to you.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.150
Absolutely.
We'll show ourselves out.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.852
- [Kaylie] Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.854
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.888
[sighs]

09:50.123 --> 09:53.293
[sighing] Well, the good news
is, we've done a great job

09:53.326 --> 09:56.029
of keeping my
anorexia a secret.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.631
They obviously haven't
even heard the rumors.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.767
Maybe we can get them
to tweak the campaign.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.269
I hate this whole
ACL injury lie.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.937
You're entitled
to your privacy.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.773
You're under no obligation
to disclose

10:05.806 --> 10:08.208
your condition to
the rest of the world.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.278
It's not a condition,
it's a disease, Dad.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.813
It's a hot button issue
in this sport

10:12.846 --> 10:15.783
and I don't want you to be
treated unfairly because of it.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.721
Look. It's a lot of money.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.658
But, um, we can
say no to this deal.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.727
It's entirely up to you.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.698
[Alex sighs]

10:33.967 --> 10:36.136
Well, yes, Kaylie
is taking endorsements

10:36.169 --> 10:37.838
that rightfully
belong to us,

10:37.871 --> 10:41.241
but truly, our biggest
concern is for the team.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.911
And how damaging it would be
for America at Worlds

10:43.944 --> 10:47.815
if, you know, the public finds
out its National Champion is

10:47.848 --> 10:48.882
[whispers] anorexic.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.752
Believe me,
I share your concern.

10:51.785 --> 10:55.689
Here's yet another scandal ready
to blow up at The Rock.

10:55.723 --> 11:00.127
I tried to get rid of Belov but
those idiots brought him back.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.262
And they made him
coach of World Team?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.998
I mean, it makes you wonder
who the idiots are, am I right?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.266
Don't even
get me started.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.636
Because I was burned by
that whole kissing scandal,

11:09.669 --> 11:12.639
I am now under investigation
for ethics violations.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.843
And nobody cares
about the integrity
of the sport like you do.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.644
Thank you.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.979
I will be exonerated

11:19.012 --> 11:22.215
but in the meantime I'm really
not in a position to make waves.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.685
Without irrefutable proof
of Kaylie's condition,

11:25.719 --> 11:27.755
there's nothing I can do.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.791
But, I hope to see you at
the Tanners' send-off party
tomorrow night?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.893
Oh, we're not invited.

11:32.926 --> 11:33.994
I'm surprised you are.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.229
I don't think they expect
to see me there

11:36.263 --> 11:38.799
but they did invite
the entire NGO

11:38.832 --> 11:42.102
and I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.339
We're talking half a million
dollars here, maybe more.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.843
Wow.
I guess you're buyin'.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.779
But how can I pretend
to be the girl

11:51.812 --> 11:54.014
who would never starve herself?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.750
Do you want my advice or
my permission to say no?

11:56.784 --> 11:58.718
[sighing]
Maybe both.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.388
You have my permission
to be true to yourself.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.724
And my advice is,
that's all that really matters.

12:04.758 --> 12:08.862
And that's what my recovery
is about.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.298
Thank you, oh,
divine sage one.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.068
Namaste, grasshopper.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.772
[both laughing]

12:18.806 --> 12:21.909
Seriously, thank you
for being here.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.015
Hey, Pay!

12:28.048 --> 12:29.817
Do you want to join us?

12:29.850 --> 12:34.922
- Yeah, the more the monotonous.
- Back at'cha Mr. Exciting.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.158
What's wrong?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.827
My parents aren't
coming to Worlds.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.228
They've never missed
a major meet.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.730
Just, we can't afford it.
I don't want to talk about it.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.232
OK

12:45.265 --> 12:48.368
If they just would've let me
take some sponsorship money
before Nationals.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.037
When everybody thought
I was going to win.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.272
I mean, might win.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.874
If I hadn't broken my back.

12:53.907 --> 12:57.144
It's OK. If you hadn't
broken your back,

12:57.177 --> 12:59.012
I might've still won.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.849
The point is,
I had offers then and now,

13:01.882 --> 13:04.284
nobody's knocking on my door.

13:04.317 --> 13:08.788
They should be.
You are the comeback kid.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.124
What better role model
is there?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.792
What are you
talking about?

13:12.826 --> 13:17.197
I am talking about you
being the spokesperson
for Healthy Bar.

13:18.866 --> 13:19.867
Why not you?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.801
I'm not the girl that
they're looking for.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.071
But you, Payson, you are.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.139
- I'm not the National Champion.
- Who cares?

13:26.173 --> 13:29.176
You don't need to be a star,
because you have a story.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.044
Yeah. An amazing story.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.513
[Kaylie] You're everything
that they're looking for.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.883
They just don't know it yet.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.319
- Who's going to tell them?
- We are.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.922
Yeah, my dad's in advertising
and he's always saying

13:41.955 --> 13:44.858
what the client really wants,
is to be told what they want.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.826
You guys are really sweet

13:46.860 --> 13:49.229
but my parents won't let me
forfeit a college scholarship

13:49.262 --> 13:50.830
by taking endorsement money.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.565
If you get this campaign

13:52.599 --> 13:56.003
you could make
half a million dollars.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.804
[Kaylie]
You can pay for college.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.506
- Or buy a Ferrari.
- Shut up, Austin.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.109
Look. It's our job to convince
the Healthy Bar people.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.444
And it's your job to
convince your parents.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.623
[rock music plays]

14:21.628 --> 14:23.596
More pictures of Payson?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.865
If I didn't know better
I might be jealous.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.968
These are for a special project
we're working on.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.037
Special secret project?

14:30.070 --> 14:33.573
Top secret, actually.
OK, ready when you are.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.611
- [music continues]
- [shutter clicks]

14:46.086 --> 14:47.620
- Awesome.
- Did you get what you need?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.389
I always get
what I need from you.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.925
- I'll see you later, OK?
- OK. See-ya.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.264
So, now that Max and I
are serious,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.933
you might want to find a new
"secret project" partner.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.936
Don't you mean now that you and
Max are "casually dating?"

15:02.970 --> 15:05.872
We're doing a lot more
than that.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.941
Well, you're not having sex.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.209
How do you know?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.945
- Because Max told me.
- Why would he tell you that?

15:11.979 --> 15:16.116
Maybe so I would know
that he's not as serious
about you as you are about him.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.685
- [Lauren scoffs]
- Just sayin'.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.338
That's the highest DOD
on vault I've ever seen.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.539
[panting] It has to be.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.975
Since I'm only competing
on one event at Worlds,

15:42.009 --> 15:45.478
I really have to
wow the judges.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.914
So, did you really
mean it when you
told that reporter

15:47.947 --> 15:49.349
you thought I should be
our team captain?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.618
Yeah. With all your experience,
you make a great team leader.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.086
Not like your friends would
ever let that happen.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.922
Because you push
everyone away.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.291
Look, I saw a different
side of you,

15:58.325 --> 15:59.626
when you came
to my house that day.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.629
If you would just
show the world that girl,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
you wouldn't have
to go at it all alone.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.267
Because gymnastics
is hard

16:07.300 --> 16:10.203
and to do what we do
we need each other's
support and sisterhood.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.939
I know you must be lonely.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.508
And I can be your friend
if you just let me.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.045
In fact, why don't you
come with me to the send-off
party tonight.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.480
I wasn't invited.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.682
I'm inviting you.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.951
To be a part of this team.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.154
So come with me
and make the first step.

16:27.187 --> 16:31.524
I promise you, if you do, my
friends will meet you halfway.

16:36.729 --> 16:37.730
[Max] What is a role model?

16:37.764 --> 16:38.965
Excuse me for
interrupting,

16:38.998 --> 16:42.001
but you don't have to
pitch us on Kaylie.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.103
We know you're the girl we want.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.737
What if you're wrong?

16:44.771 --> 16:47.040
What if there's
a better girl?

16:47.074 --> 16:48.441
You want to pitch us
a better girl?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.710
- Yes.
- Well, this is a first.

16:50.743 --> 16:53.180
If you'll indulge us for
just a second I promise you,

16:53.213 --> 16:54.247
you won't be sorry.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.283
What is a role model?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.551
A person worthy of imitation.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.752
Who inspires.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.521
And for young women,

17:01.554 --> 17:04.557
looking to define themselves
and their dreams, you ask...

17:04.591 --> 17:06.259
"Who can they look up to?"

17:06.293 --> 17:09.729
How about someone who has
struggled against insurmountable
obstacles,

17:09.762 --> 17:10.763
to follow her dream?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.636
Someone who the world had
written off, but who triumphed

17:16.669 --> 17:17.804
because she never gave up.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.475
And now,
less than a year later,

17:22.509 --> 17:24.744
due to her courage
and determination,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.779
she's back
and better than ever.

17:28.315 --> 17:31.751
And so, if what you're looking
for is a role model

17:35.355 --> 17:37.190
Then here she is...

17:38.758 --> 17:42.762
The bold, the beautiful

17:43.563 --> 17:47.066
and the very brave...

17:47.100 --> 17:48.101
...Payson Keeler.

18:05.118 --> 18:10.657
They're offering $25,000 now and
250,000 if I medal at Worlds!

18:10.690 --> 18:13.593
With that kind of money,
we could pay for college.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.762
Payson, there's no
guarantee you'll medal.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.330
But I will!

18:17.364 --> 18:18.798
And the Healthy Bar people
could've chosen anybody,

18:18.831 --> 18:20.333
but they're betting
their money on me.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.568
Well, not all of it.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.835
What were they offering
Kaylie up front?

18:22.869 --> 18:27.607
Before Nationals we turned down
a $100,000 offer,

18:27.640 --> 18:30.810
We don't want to forfeit your
NCAA scholarship eligibility

18:30.843 --> 18:32.579
for a puny 25 grand.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.646
Your mother's right.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.783
We can't be gambling
with your college education.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.419
But, didn't we gamble
when we went into debt

18:39.452 --> 18:40.687
for my back surgery?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.089
And what happens if I
get injured again?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.425
Then college is off the table
and we've, what?

18:46.726 --> 18:49.362
[quivering] We've lost
the house? For nothing?

18:49.396 --> 18:52.365
Payson, we don't want you
worrying about our finances.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.801
Then let me get us out of
the hole I helped get us into.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.669
Otherwise, I'm not
going to Worlds.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.539
If we're in such big trouble
that you guys can't afford
to be there,

18:59.572 --> 19:01.674
then I can't keep
pursuing this dream.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.277
Let's just keep cool.
OK?

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
And we can talk about this
another time.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.815
Right now we have to get
ready for the Tanners' party.

19:08.848 --> 19:13.553
Promise me that you'll at least
try to keep an open mind?

19:14.821 --> 19:15.788
We promise.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.296
Can you believe that?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.365
$25,000?

19:25.398 --> 19:27.500
We could sure use $25,000
right now.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.771
Well, are you saying we should
let her forfeit college

19:31.804 --> 19:33.440
so that she can
pay the bills?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.275
Like Kelly Parker's
"manamomster?"

19:35.308 --> 19:36.809
We're not like that woman.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.347
I'm not talking about
exploiting our daughter.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.350
But she is a
professional athlete.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.386
We're holding on to this old
value system as if she were

19:46.419 --> 19:48.388
competing on an amateur level.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.623
Maybe we're wrong.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.266
You must be relieved
to have that back.

19:59.299 --> 20:03.303
Not that anyone who matters
believes you did anything wrong

20:03.336 --> 20:05.905
but it completely
exonerates you.

20:05.938 --> 20:09.409
It doesn't exonerate me from
leading Payson to believe I had
romantic feelings for her.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.444
Is there anything that
happens around here

20:11.478 --> 20:13.280
that you don't
blame yourself for?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.951
I don't blame myself for you
running back to Steve Tanner

20:18.985 --> 20:21.754
because you found you'd almost
betrayed your vow of chastity.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.691
Or maybe you were just angry
with me...

20:24.724 --> 20:26.659
..because I
respected your values?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.462
Why would I be
angry about that?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.731
You felt rejected?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.601
I can't have this conversation.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.669
Why not?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.538
You've always got all
the right answers.

20:40.807 --> 20:44.811
I ran away from you because
you may respect my values

20:44.844 --> 20:48.848
but you don't share them and
you are not going to change.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.617
As Steve Tanner has.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.420
Yes.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.290
You know the biggest
mistake women make?

20:57.324 --> 21:00.259
Is believing their
love can change a man.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.795
Though I seriously doubt
you love him.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.832
I'm where God
wants me to be.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.835
No.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.707
You're where
you feel safe.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.750
[whispering]
Please.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.940
So Kelly, don't think
just because Kaylie Cruz

21:47.974 --> 21:50.743
invited you to this party
she's your new BFF.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.379
She's still
the competition, OK?

21:52.412 --> 21:53.746
She's also my teammate.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.018
Well good then, why don't
you worry about being a
team player

21:59.051 --> 22:02.822
and just forget that I've
sacrificed everything

22:02.855 --> 22:04.657
to make you a star.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.793
Including my marriage.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.028
Do you know why
your father left?

22:09.061 --> 22:13.299
Because I was too busy
making your dreams come true.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.737
And as long as Kaylie Cruz
is on that World Team,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.439
it's over.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.909
I gave up my life
and my happiness

22:22.942 --> 22:24.777
and I have nothing
to show for it.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.914
I am a total and
complete failure.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.882
[sobbing]
And my life is over.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.519
But you be a team player.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.532
It's not over.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.669
Look.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.670
What's that?

22:50.703 --> 22:51.838
It's Kaylie's journal.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.809
I took it...
today, from her gym bag.

23:00.513 --> 23:04.551
"My name is Kaylie Cruz
and I am anorexic."

23:04.584 --> 23:07.587
And this is her
handwriting.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.588
- Yes.
- [laughing]

23:08.621 --> 23:10.122
Do you know what this means?

23:10.156 --> 23:12.725
Kaylie Cruz is off the team.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.528
And you, my darling daughter,

23:15.562 --> 23:17.830
are the new Healthy Bar
spokesperson!

23:17.864 --> 23:21.701
I'm so proud of you.
What a good girl!

23:21.734 --> 23:24.471
I want you to take this
journal to the party

23:24.504 --> 23:25.972
and you give it to Ellen Beals.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.840
And she will know
what to do with it.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.809
All right?

23:29.842 --> 23:31.744
This means that Kaylie
is finished.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.880
And we are back, baby!
[laughs]

23:37.850 --> 23:41.621
You are such a pretty girl.
Do you know that?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.960
Momma did good, huh?
[chuckling]

23:52.832 --> 23:54.701
[salsa music playing]

23:55.802 --> 23:57.670
- Welcome!
- Hi!

23:57.704 --> 23:58.971
You all look gorgeous.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.873
Well, we clean up OK.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.843
And speaking of OK,
nice dress, Payson.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.679
I hope you guys are hungry,
because we have a fabulous
buffet.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.915
- I'm all over that.
- [Summer laughs]

24:09.949 --> 24:11.951
Oh, my God.
Look who's here.

24:12.552 --> 24:14.687
Hey, nice party.

24:14.721 --> 24:15.755
[emphasizing]
What's she doing here?

24:15.788 --> 24:20.426
She's my plus one.
And she's our teammate.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.795
I thought she didn't
believe in team?

24:22.829 --> 24:24.897
Well, I'm here aren't I?

24:25.932 --> 24:28.835
Lauren, why don't you
show KP your house.

24:28.868 --> 24:32.605
[clears throat]
Fine. Follow me.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.779
So? I'm dying to know what your
parents said about the Healthy
Bar offer.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.881
Well, they didn't say yes,
but they didn't say no.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.850
They should've been
there to hear Max.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.818
- He was really incredible.
- I know.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.086
Move over Don Draper.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.521
I wonder if he's here yet?

24:48.555 --> 24:49.822
Although if he was,
I am sure that

24:49.856 --> 24:52.124
Lauren would be
licking his face.

24:52.158 --> 24:55.862
Sounds like someone's jealous.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.564
We're just friends.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.865
So you keep saying.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.633
Look who's talking.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.538
- You look beautiful.
- [chuckles]

25:08.975 --> 25:10.677
Both of you.
[laughs]

25:10.710 --> 25:12.579
Awkward.
Well, if you'll excuse me.

25:12.612 --> 25:16.082
I'm going to see how much free
food I can shove in my purse,
just in case.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.051
Her folks said no
to Healthy Bar?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.787
They haven't decided.

25:25.658 --> 25:26.926
It's about time you got here.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.527
Come on, I want to
show you something.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.765
That was a very
cool thing you did,

25:32.799 --> 25:34.567
passing all that money
on to Payson.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.168
That's what friends are for.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.576
Wanna take a walk
on the wild side?

25:43.610 --> 25:44.877
I happen to know
the fox trot.

25:44.911 --> 25:48.014
[chuckling] Is there anything
you can't do?

25:48.047 --> 25:50.850
[sighing] Fly.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.852
- But, I'm working on it.
- [chuckles]

25:55.221 --> 25:56.222
Ta-da!

25:57.890 --> 26:00.727
- [chuckles]
- What is this?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.128
My meditation room.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.998
You got a bed in your
meditation room?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.837
Sometimes, I like to meditate...

26:10.870 --> 26:12.639
...laying down.

26:13.740 --> 26:14.907
[Lauren chuckles]

26:21.280 --> 26:23.883
I thought we were
gonna take this slow.

26:23.916 --> 26:28.054
We can take it
as slow as you want.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.833
[samba music playing]

26:51.644 --> 26:52.812
What's this?

26:52.845 --> 26:54.847
[exhaling] A proposal.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.649
I already said yes.

26:56.683 --> 26:59.085
To the "what"
but not the "when".

27:00.286 --> 27:02.822
Let's get married in Rio,

27:02.855 --> 27:06.625
the city famous for the statue
of Christ the Redeemer.

27:06.659 --> 27:09.028
[sighing] It's perfect.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.700
You're right.
It's perfect.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.337
You OK?

27:18.370 --> 27:22.074
[stammering] Yeah. It's just
that we're entertaining.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.191
What's wrong?

27:40.126 --> 27:41.994
Lauren, you're
seriously hot but

27:42.028 --> 27:43.863
I'm not ready
to have sex with you.

27:45.865 --> 27:46.933
You seem ready.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.836
[chuckling]
I'm not emotionally ready.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.772
[sighs] Is this about Payson?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.341
Because she will never really be
able to give you what you need.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.176
All she cares about
is her gymnastics

27:57.209 --> 27:59.211
and the second you get in the
way of that, which you will,

27:59.245 --> 28:00.813
she'll drop you cold.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.883
But until you figure that out,
stop wasting my time!

28:09.822 --> 28:12.191
Besides a college scholarship,

28:12.224 --> 28:15.762
are there really any other
cons to letting Payson
take the money?

28:15.795 --> 28:17.429
Besides crushing
my male ego?

28:17.463 --> 28:18.798
Come on. Mark.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.833
You know, hoping for
a scholarship for Payson

28:20.867 --> 28:22.434
is a gamble in
its own way.

28:22.468 --> 28:26.372
Maybe it's time we think about
striking while the iron is hot.

28:26.405 --> 28:29.742
I wanted to be the parent
who paid his daughter's way
through this sport.

28:29.776 --> 28:32.111
Who doesn't
mortgage her dreams.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.747
And who bankrupts
his family along the way?

28:34.781 --> 28:36.749
Because that's
where we're headed.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.318
Hey, what do you think
about that Healthy Bar offer?

28:39.351 --> 28:42.789
I mean, it cost my kid a mil but
it's a good deal for yours,

28:42.822 --> 28:43.890
coming off an injury.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.858
We haven't decided whether
to let her take it.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.693
Why wouldn't you?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.729
College scholarship
eligibility for one. And...

28:50.763 --> 28:52.799
And the bulk of
the Healthy Bar money

28:52.832 --> 28:54.801
is contingent on her
medaling at Worlds.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.435
Which is a big gamble.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.237
[Alex] It's not my place
to tell you what to do,

28:58.270 --> 29:02.775
but you already made the gamble
when you let Payson become
an elite athlete.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.144
If you don't know in your heart
that she can go all the way,

29:05.177 --> 29:07.746
what was all the sacrifice for?

29:13.019 --> 29:15.187
[slow waltz playing]

29:16.889 --> 29:19.225
I have a confession to make.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.761
OK.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.865
I'm dying to
kiss you right now.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.134
[sighs, chuckles]

29:28.167 --> 29:31.437
I know we can't.
I just wish we could.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.510
So do I.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.884
Who invited Kelly Parker?

29:44.917 --> 29:46.018
[Kaylie] I did.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.054
[Austin] Be careful.
I don't trust that girl.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.322
She's not so dangerous.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.959
She's like a cornered animal.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.828
She'll show you her teeth
but she won't bite.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.832
Oh, speaking of someone
who will bite,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.401
look who just walked in.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.876
What is Ellen Beals
doing here?

30:09.909 --> 30:14.013
Don't Panic, we invited
all the NGO members.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.448
What if she tells someone
that I'm the one who
sent her that video?

30:16.482 --> 30:19.185
If she hasn't by now,
she's not going to.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.820
Who knows, maybe
she's here to make nice.

30:21.854 --> 30:25.524
Go. Mingle.
I'll handle this.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.563
Ellen, so nice to see you.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.232
Really?

30:33.265 --> 30:34.833
After I got you elected
President of the Rock
Parents Board

30:34.867 --> 30:36.202
and then never
heard from you again,

30:36.235 --> 30:38.170
I thought I'd be
the last person
you'd want to see.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.906
- About that...
- Don't waste your breath.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.174
Sasha won, I lost
and you switched sides.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.842
Happens all the time.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.211
But I'm still standing

30:45.244 --> 30:47.813
and I came tonight to remind
everyone that I may be down

30:47.846 --> 30:50.082
but I'm not out.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.990
[up-tempo samba music]

31:07.633 --> 31:11.303
- Ellen Beals is here.
- Good for her.

31:11.337 --> 31:14.240
When we invited the NGO members
we never dreamed

31:14.273 --> 31:16.008
she'd have the nerve
to show her face.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.945
All I'm concerned with right now
is finding a drink.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.914
There's one. Excuse me.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.585
There you are.
You guys having fun?

31:30.022 --> 31:31.657
What's... what's going on?

31:32.524 --> 31:34.360
We've made our decision.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.228
About the Healthy Bar deal.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.070
Why do I get the feeling
you have bad news?

31:44.103 --> 31:45.204
Because...

31:45.237 --> 31:47.639
I'm totally messing with you.
They said yes!

31:47.673 --> 31:50.109
What! That's, that's great!

31:50.142 --> 31:51.410
Oh my God.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.345
My parents are coming
to Worlds and when I medal

31:53.379 --> 31:56.282
we can pay our debt off
and my dad can take
his time finding a job

31:56.315 --> 31:57.883
and I owe it all to you.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.219
What you did, and what you said
to those Healthy Bar people,

32:00.252 --> 32:02.554
- you were amazing.
- Because you're amazing.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.491
I love you.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.159
And I always thought
I couldn't have a boyfriend

32:07.193 --> 32:08.660
because it would mess
with my gymnastics,

32:08.694 --> 32:11.998
but you've made me better.
You've made everything better.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.266
And I would really like it
if you could kiss me right now

32:14.300 --> 32:16.568
so I could please
stop talking.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.341
Oh my God.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.577
I am so sorry.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.014
I just made a complete
fool of myself.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.649
No. No, you didn't.
I'm just, I...

32:30.682 --> 32:31.650
I wasn't expecting this.

32:31.683 --> 32:32.951
Because you don't
feel the same way.

32:32.985 --> 32:36.122
Payson, no, I'm just
a little overwhelmed...

32:36.155 --> 32:38.657
It's OK. It's OK.
I get it.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.593
We said we were just
gonna be friends.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.629
So...

32:43.662 --> 32:47.966
[quivering] Just please
forget that this ever happened.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.505
We should get back
to the party.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.974
[sighing] Payson.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.582
- [music playing]
- [crowd chattering]

33:05.417 --> 33:07.586
Have you seen Max?

33:09.021 --> 33:10.622
He's with Payson.

33:15.694 --> 33:16.695
Hello, Lauren.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.532
Miss Beals. I'm so glad
you came. How are you?

33:20.566 --> 33:23.369
Not well. I'm under
an ethics investigation.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.970
You know why?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.173
Because for some reason
you decided to anonymously

33:27.206 --> 33:30.442
send the original training cam
disc to the NGO.

33:30.476 --> 33:31.977
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.512
Don't worry.
I won't out you.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.514
Even though some people
are accusing me of

33:35.547 --> 33:38.284
editing the disc myself
so I could be named
the World Team Coach.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.586
But personal ambition has
never been what drives me.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.589
All I want is for
the American team

33:43.622 --> 33:46.558
to win the Olympics in 2012.

33:46.592 --> 33:50.262
And for now,
we need you to do that.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.531
But you did burn me

33:52.564 --> 33:54.766
and I'm sure I'll find
some way to return the favor.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.604
Good luck in Rio.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.211
- Hey.
- Hey!

34:39.245 --> 34:41.280
Wanna go check out
the buffet with me?

34:41.313 --> 34:44.216
[stammering]
Could I talk to you?
Alone?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.618
Oh, OK.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.058
Uh, can I please
have your attention?

34:53.091 --> 34:54.826
Look, I just want to
thank you all for coming.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.696
I'm sure that you are all as
excited as I am

34:57.729 --> 35:01.233
to kick some major butt
at Worlds!

35:01.267 --> 35:02.834
[cheering]

35:08.807 --> 35:13.745
[stammering] And I have a very
special announcement to make.

35:13.779 --> 35:17.749
After we win the gold at Worlds,

35:17.783 --> 35:19.318
[applause, cheers]

35:19.351 --> 35:22.288
I'm going to put some gold
on my fiancée's finger.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.723
Well, a gold wedding band
that is.

35:24.756 --> 35:28.294
Summer and I have decided
to get married in Rio,

35:28.327 --> 35:31.230
right after Worlds
and we'd love you all to come.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.764
[squeals]

35:32.798 --> 35:35.201
- [applause]
- I'm so excited!

35:39.838 --> 35:42.241
[Lauren] I also would like
to make an announcement.

35:42.274 --> 35:46.745
After Summer marries my dad,
she's going to adopt me.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.615
She's going to be
my legal mother.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.916
[applause, cheers]

35:51.917 --> 35:54.586
[exclaiming]
Daddy, I'm so happy!

35:56.555 --> 35:57.823
[applause continues]

36:04.896 --> 36:07.766
It means a lot that you
invited me here tonight.

36:07.799 --> 36:10.669
It means a lot that you came.
We're teammates.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.839
[sighs]
And friends. I hope.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.674
We are.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.811
Which is why I wanted
to give you this.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.582
[stammering]
What is that?

36:23.615 --> 36:26.685
[Kelly] It's your journal.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.854
Where did you get this?

36:29.721 --> 36:30.722
I took it.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.659
When I came over that one day.

36:34.726 --> 36:35.827
Why?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.867
[sighing] Because it's
all about you being anorexic.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.802
and I thought I could use it

36:43.835 --> 36:45.737
to get you kicked off
the World Team.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.739
Wow.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.477
I invited you
over to my house

36:51.510 --> 36:55.947
because you were upset and
didn't have anyone to talk to

36:55.981 --> 36:59.485
and you stole my most
private possession?

36:59.518 --> 37:00.852
And you obviously read it.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.289
I won't tell anyone
what you wrote.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.457
And I'm giving it back
because I want you to know

37:05.491 --> 37:07.493
that you can trust me.

37:07.526 --> 37:10.629
Trust you?
Are you crazy?

37:10.662 --> 37:12.898
I will never trust you.

37:14.266 --> 37:17.536
And everyone
was right about you.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.272
You are a horrible
human being.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.611
[sobbing]

37:30.782 --> 37:31.917
[door opens]

37:34.586 --> 37:35.587
Ooh.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.826
Hey. What are you doing?

37:40.859 --> 37:44.696
Uh, enjoying Mr. Tanner's
20 year-old scotch.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.765
Although I have to tell you,

37:46.798 --> 37:50.769
this two years, 20 years,
it all tastes like crap to me.

37:51.903 --> 37:52.871
What the hell
is wrong with you?

37:52.904 --> 37:56.742
That's a good frickin'
question, Austin.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.745
Two girls threw
themselves at me tonight.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.814
One offered me her body,
the other her love

38:02.848 --> 38:05.016
and I couldn't say yes
to either one of them.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.786
[chuckling]
OK, Romeo, you're drunk.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.388
I'm taking you home.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.497
What was that, man?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.734
That was a kiss.
I kissed you.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.770
Why?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.638
Because I wanted to.

38:27.439 --> 38:30.075
So, what? You're gay?

38:30.942 --> 38:32.511
No.

38:34.045 --> 38:36.915
- You just like to kiss guys?
- And girls.

38:43.755 --> 38:47.793
Hey. Congratulations
on your upcoming nuptials.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.794
Thank you.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.696
I have to say,
I'm surprised.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.599
I thought from the way you
so passionately defended Sasha

38:53.632 --> 38:55.867
that you two had
something going on.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.903
That's none
of your business.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.639
And frankly I think
you have a lot of nerve

39:00.672 --> 39:02.941
showing your face here
after you used that bogus video

39:02.974 --> 39:04.309
to get rid of Sasha.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.044
I had no idea it
was bogus at the time.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.980
Or that the person who sent it
to me had tampered with it.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.683
I suspect that person
was you.

39:11.717 --> 39:12.918
I give you my word,
it wasn't.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.853
Then tell me
who it was.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.923
Why don't you
ask your fiancé?

39:24.496 --> 39:29.034
So, if you're not gay
and you're not straight,

39:29.067 --> 39:30.068
that makes you...?

39:30.101 --> 39:32.438
- Bisexual.
- Come on.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.005
What?
A guy can't be bisexual?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.875
Because that defies some sort
of stereotype of masculinity?

39:36.908 --> 39:38.910
I don't know. I've never
known any bisexual guys.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.746
Well, you know me.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.681
Not as well as I thought I did.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.750
So, you're freaked out?

39:44.783 --> 39:47.919
[sighs] I don't know.
It's kind of hard to understand.

39:47.953 --> 39:51.957
Exactly. And if I tell Lauren
or Payson that I'm also
attracted to guys,

39:51.990 --> 39:54.960
do you think they'll understand?
Or be turned off?

39:54.993 --> 39:56.828
Or like most people,
think that I'm gay

39:56.862 --> 39:58.897
but I just can't admit it?

39:58.930 --> 40:01.900
I wish I was just gay.
Life would be a lot simpler.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.737
I don't know what to say.

40:05.771 --> 40:06.738
Of course you don't.

40:06.772 --> 40:09.374
'Cause it's so easy
being Austin Tucker, huh?

40:09.407 --> 40:12.143
You have no idea what
it's like to be me, man.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.712
Nobody does.

40:13.745 --> 40:17.783
And I can't explain why I'm
attracted to guys and girls.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.117
But I don't want to hurt anyone.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.719
Especially Payson.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.921
I mean, how is a girl like that
not going to be freaked out?

40:22.954 --> 40:25.824
You think she'd still love me
if she knew who I really was?

40:25.857 --> 40:28.760
So that's why you
didn't go for it?

40:30.829 --> 40:33.699
I think that if
you care about her,

40:33.732 --> 40:35.066
then you have to tell her.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.605
But you're not in any condition
to tell her tonight.

40:39.638 --> 40:40.606
Come on.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.040
Let's get you
out of here.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.744
[flamenco music playing]

40:48.480 --> 40:50.549
I'm going to ask you,
one last time,

40:50.582 --> 40:53.018
and I demand an
honest answer.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.986
Did you have
anything to do

40:55.020 --> 40:57.022
with sending that
training cam video
to Ellen Beals?

40:58.657 --> 40:59.858
No.

40:59.891 --> 41:01.660
Do you know who did?

41:02.661 --> 41:05.864
You vowed, with God
as your witness

41:05.897 --> 41:09.801
that you would never
lie to me again.

41:09.835 --> 41:14.472
[sobbing] Please,
I deserve the truth.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.945
Yes. I know who did it.

41:20.779 --> 41:21.780
Who?

41:22.814 --> 41:23.815
Who did it?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.084
I did.

41:28.153 --> 41:32.457
[sobbing] But it was only so
you would break up with Sasha

41:32.490 --> 41:34.693
and marry my dad
so that you could be my mom.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.763
Dad didn't know anything
about it, until way later.

41:37.796 --> 41:40.899
He was just protecting me.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.635
So you can still marry him.

41:46.572 --> 41:51.076
Do you have any idea how
much pain you've caused?

41:51.109 --> 41:55.480
I don't want to have anything
to do with your father.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.514
Or with you.

41:56.548 --> 41:58.684
Ever again.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.857
I'll go after her.
I'll fix this.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.626
Don't worry.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.867
Hey, I just, uh, came
to get my jacket in here.

42:17.102 --> 42:18.837
[sobbing]

42:23.642 --> 42:24.776
You OK?

42:25.911 --> 42:27.713
Do you care about me at all?

42:27.746 --> 42:29.180
Of course I do.

42:29.214 --> 42:32.918
Then can we get
out of here? Please?

42:33.852 --> 42:35.821
I don't wanna have sex,

42:35.854 --> 42:38.890
I just don't
want to be alone.

42:52.971 --> 42:56.608
Want to talk about it?
Tell me why you're upset?

42:58.710 --> 42:59.978
I'm not upset.

43:01.980 --> 43:06.051
She'll forgive me.
I know she will.

43:07.285 --> 43:09.621
She didn't mean it.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.258
She loves me.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.662
Who are we talking about?

43:17.796 --> 43:19.597
My mother.

43:20.766 --> 43:23.034
I thought you said your mother
was... was dead?

43:24.369 --> 43:25.370
What?

43:26.972 --> 43:28.139
Lauren! Stop!

43:28.173 --> 43:29.675
[tires screeching]

43:30.075 --> 43:31.076
[Lauren gasping]

43:32.944 --> 43:34.813
- Whoa!
- [tires screeching]

43:34.846 --> 43:35.914
[honking]
