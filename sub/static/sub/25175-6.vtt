00:02.990 --> 00:04.605
Don't move! Katherine Hale?

00:04.710 --> 00:05.927
I'm a federal officer.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.487
I need a clearance check
on a ﬁrst name, "Gabrielle"...

00:08.590 --> 00:09.978
Joubert.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.253
It's Iris. I'm going light
on the food, heaw on the wine.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.488
-How's she doing?
-You know, Elden and I didn't
have a great marriage.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.409
The agency
was his real mistress.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.385
[Joe]
There is a woman,
/0ng black hair.

00:19.490 --> 00:20.787
She sounds Middle-Eastern.

00:20.890 --> 00:23.245
If you come across her,
you fucking run.

[man on 71/]
Caleb Wolfe
/3' making headlines today.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.919
IEP Analytics wasn ’t really
a tech company at all.

00:30.020 --> 00:31.191
[Caleb]
It was a CIA front.

00:31.300 --> 00:35.077
_Someone out there could
still have weaponlzed plague.

00:35.180 --> 00:37.557
[Bob]
And we na ye to assume
they’re gomg to use It.

00:37.660 --> 00:40.959
One guy out there still
knows about the companies,
Nathan, he's just an analyst.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.607
Your greed is putting
this entire operation at risk.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.041
And who the fuck are you?

00:45.150 --> 00:46.959
I'm the guy
who can take you to see Caleb.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.617
[muffled shouting]

00:48.720 --> 00:50.711
[Joe yelling] Caleb!

00:51.640 --> 00:54.279
[theme music playing]

01:24.990 --> 01:26.992
I had a dream, two nights ago.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.989
All those people at
the football game
at ComQuest Field,

01:37.090 --> 01:39.422
got infected with the plague.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.499
And they went and infected
their families,

01:42.610 --> 01:44.987
and their friends
and their neighbors,

01:45.090 --> 01:47.877
until everyone
in the whole world

01:47.980 --> 01:49.971
was both murderer and victim.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.371
I woke up in a cold sweat.

01:52.820 --> 01:56.085
I went down into my office,

01:56.190 --> 01:59.318
and I learned everything
I possibly could
about the plague.

01:59.430 --> 02:02.365
And what I discovered
was an enemy

02:02.470 --> 02:07.590
who could change the fate
of the world in only 24 hours.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.499
However, this enemy
is not invincible.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.659
Modern medicine is equipped

02:15.770 --> 02:18.147
to protect us from
this kind of an attack,

02:18.250 --> 02:22.380
but we lack the infrastructure
to deliver the treatment
to enough people

02:22.490 --> 02:25.653
in enough places
in a short enough period
of time.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.251
But I'm about to change that.

02:29.820 --> 02:33.153
Gentlemen and lady,

02:33.260 --> 02:35.125
I give you Volaris.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.221
[suspenseful music playing]

02:38.870 --> 02:41.759
Using a fine particulate
aerosol spray, Vorlaris

02:41.870 --> 02:46.091
can vaccinate one square mile
of inhabitants in 20 minutes,

02:46.200 --> 02:49.419
protecting healthy populations
against the spread
of an epidemic

02:49.520 --> 02:52.739
with unparalleled speed
and efficiency.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.058
Volaris will allow us
to provrde

02:55.170 --> 02:57.161
effective protection

02:58.170 --> 03:00.161
to, quite frankly,

03:02.050 --> 03:04.052
as much,

03:04.460 --> 03:07.020
or as little of the world
as we choose.

03:16.270 --> 03:19.808
[Gareth]
7'he threats we face
today are so great that
the world

03:19.910 --> 03:21.901
isn ’t big enough to hide in.

03:25.920 --> 03:30.892
We must act quickly
and decisive/y to deal
with these new dangers

03:31.000 --> 03:33.002
[indistinct chatter]

03:34.370 --> 03:36.543
Remember Julius Caeser,

03:36.650 --> 03:39.039

-I'm gonna let you go.

04:50.410 --> 04:53.299
If you try to hit me again,
I will knock you the fuck out.

-All right?
-Fuck off.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.182
[Joe panting and coughing]

04:58.290 --> 05:00.611
I do not want to do
that shit to you man,
all right?

05:02.340 --> 05:04.331
Where the fuck is he?

05:05.220 --> 05:07.211
Follow me.

05:29.650 --> 05:31.299
[Caleb] I'm good.

05:31.410 --> 05:33.219
You gonna drug me again
on the way out?

05:33.330 --> 05:36.458
We were friends six years
ago, and then you disappeared.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.549
And the next thing I hear,
you're in the CIA.

05:38.660 --> 05:42.152
So, I can't help but wonder
if the CIA is using you to
bait a trap for me.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.956
Especially, if they know
our history, which
they obviously do,

05:45.060 --> 05:46.550
-because they're
the fucking CIA--
-Well, I come in here

05:46.660 --> 05:48.480
and you immediately
start wondering if the CIA

05:48.590 --> 05:51.388
faked the deaths of 12
of its own people to lay
a trap for you?

05:53.990 --> 05:55.981
Yeah, well, just because
you're paranoid...

05:59.200 --> 06:01.191
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.037
I need to know who
your source was on the IEP.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.441
You first.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.881
What the fuck happened
over there, man?

Everything okay?

06:34.310 --> 06:35.368
[door opens]

06:35.470 --> 06:38.416
No, I'm, I'm at work, and uh...

06:38.520 --> 06:40.511
Looks like it might
be a lonely night.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.984
Hey, I love you, too.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.611
Fuck!

08:59.940 --> 09:02.067
[sighs] I didn't think
anyone else was here.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.729
[chuckles]

09:05.830 --> 09:08.207
Guess we both had
the same idea, huh?

09:08.310 --> 09:10.653
Come back here,
check the place out again.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.172
I just assumed you had scurvy.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.009
[Boyd chuckles]

09:15.120 --> 09:17.111
Why'd you follow me?

09:17.960 --> 09:20.167
-What?
-You thought you were
gonna get laid?

09:21.650 --> 09:23.641
Weren't you wearing
a wedding band earlier?

09:28.650 --> 09:29.992
There it is.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.091
Or maybe that's your cock-ring.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.872
I saw you staring at me
at the office,

09:35.980 --> 09:37.436
and I spotted you on N

09:37.540 --> 09:40.964
-and when I turned
onto WISCOn_Sln--
-I wasn't followmg you.

09:41.070 --> 09:43.004
Hmm.

09:43.110 --> 09:45.203
Marty said that, uh...

09:45.310 --> 09:47.926
Someone called Turner,
just before we got here.

09:48.030 --> 09:50.578
Kathy Hale doesn't drive, so...

09:50.680 --> 09:52.671
I figured he's gotta
be close by, right?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.497
Came back to check it out.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.830
Did you come up with
that excuse on your drive over?

10:00.130 --> 10:01.666
I mean,

10:01.770 --> 10:04.238
it can't be that you're here
'cause you're a good cop.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.891
A good cop would have
seen the note on the fridge.

10:15.660 --> 10:17.662
Instructions
for feeding the cat?

10:18.110 --> 10:20.101
Do you see a cat?

10:32.120 --> 10:34.111
[cat meows]

12:04.820 --> 12:07.311
Katherine Hale,
we're with the police.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.411
Open that door up
for me, please.

12:11.180 --> 12:13.319
Kick that door open.

12:13.430 --> 12:14.727
Oh, thank God.

12:14.830 --> 12:16.081
I thought you were him.

12:16.190 --> 12:17.282
Who? Joe Turner?

12:17.390 --> 12:19.688
-I thought he came back.
-When did he leave?

12:19.790 --> 12:21.769
Huh? When did he leave?

12:21.870 --> 12:25.135
[voice trembling] Hours ago.
I just got myself untied
when I heard you downstairs.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.776
-Okay, okay, okay, hey...
-I thought you were him.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.256
-Okay, hey.
-I was so scared.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.931
I'm going to come in there,
and help you out, okay?

12:31.040 --> 12:33.679
You're okay, now.
We're the good guys, okay?

12:34.810 --> 12:36.789
Okay, can you stand up?

12:36.890 --> 12:38.346
I'm gonna help you up.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.305
Breathe. One, two, three.
There you go.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.412
-It's okay.
-[Joubert] Where did Turner go?

12:44.620 --> 12:45.791
[intense music]

12:45.900 --> 12:47.891
I don't know.
He didn't talk to me.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.536
You didn't speak the whole
time he was here?

12:51.260 --> 12:53.262
No. Not really.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.769
What did he do?

12:55.870 --> 12:57.861
He kept me tied up,
and in the closet.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.301
Did you scream?

13:00.630 --> 13:02.291
-He gagged me.
-[Boyd] Okay, it's okay.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.858
All right, let's get you
sitting down, okay?

13:05.960 --> 13:07.951
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Are you injured?

13:08.680 --> 13:10.568
-No, I'm okay.
-Okay.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.989
Nice and easy. There you go.
Sit down.

13:13.090 --> 13:16.878
[Boyd] Hey, look at me.
You're safe now, okay?

13:17.890 --> 13:19.141
All right.

[Joubert and Boyd whispering]

13:27.100 --> 13:29.091
[Joubert continues whispering]

13:37.310 --> 13:39.301
Hey, Kathryn.

13:39.790 --> 13:41.530
You okay?

13:41.640 --> 13:43.892
Okay. Here's what we're
going to do.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.809
We're going to stay here
with you for a little while,

13:45.920 --> 13:47.911
and see if Turner comes
back, all rIght?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.821
I don't think he will.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.909
When we found you
in the closet, you said,

13:53.010 --> 13:54.784
you thought he came back.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.619
I was scared.

13:56.730 --> 13:57.742
I don't know
what I was thinking.

13:57.850 --> 13:59.852
Now you're sure he won't
come back. Why?

14:01.180 --> 14:02.909
I just didn't
get that sense from him.

14:03.020 --> 14:06.035
How can you get any sense
from him when you were tied
up in the closet?

14:06.140 --> 14:07.994
[Boyd] Okay, hey, listen,

14:08.100 --> 14:10.102
we're going to figure it
out together, all right?

Hi. [clears throat] Sam Barber.

I'm his wife.

-Enjoy the party.
-Thank you.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.041
[Mae] Lord Byron had
his own private army.

16:14.150 --> 16:16.835
[exhales] Gareth does not have
a private army.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.528
[Mae] Oh, my God!
It's the actual military
industrial complex.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.982
Is all this
from government contracts?

16:25.090 --> 16:27.081
[Sam] All right, you're being
antagonistic.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.948
Our taxes paid for this house.

16:30.050 --> 16:33.042
Meanwhile, this Gareth guy
probably thinks that people
on welfare are lazy.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.317
I'm not being antagonistic.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.650
Yeah, you are. You're already
doing Dr. Strangelove.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.076
I can't help it.

16:40.180 --> 16:42.273
It just comes out
the closer I get to fascists.

Uh, could you give us
just a sec? Thanks.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.734
You don't know these people.
Give them a chance.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.035
I will go down on you
for an hour, when we get home.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.539
You say that like it's work.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.642
You should think of it
as a reward.

Can I take
your picture, please?

17:39.120 --> 17:41.827
I's nice to finally meet you.
I'm Elden Loramer.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.306
Mmm, mmm...

17:43.410 --> 17:45.344
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

17:45.450 --> 17:46.667
It's a very bad joke.

17:46.770 --> 17:49.068
-It's lovely to meet you.
-[Elden chuckles]

17:49.170 --> 17:51.673
I often have a chat with
my Wife before these parties,
and it usually

17:51.780 --> 17:54.999
-illicits the same reaction.
-Oh. Good to know.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.829
Actually, she really
wants to meet you.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.430
-Rea|ly?
-I'll be right back.

17:58.540 --> 18:01.088
-Um...
-He got that just from
my mumbling?

18:01.190 --> 18:03.442
Yeah, he taught psy-ops
at The Farm.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.723
-What's that mean?
-That means he's fucking smart.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.286
Okay, sorry.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.802
-[Sam] Behave.
-No.

18:09.910 --> 18:11.855
-[Iris] Are you going to say--
-[Elden] Whoa, we will.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.576
Sam, Mae,
this is my wife, Iris.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.057
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Mae. It's so nice
to meet you.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.855
Hi, Iris. Sam, a pleasure.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.507
Hi. Um...

18:20.610 --> 18:23.022
I begged Elden to buy
your house.

18:24.690 --> 18:27.386
Ah! We'll have to get
together and covet
each other's houses.

18:27.490 --> 18:28.468
[all chuckling]

18:28.570 --> 18:30.470
Mae, can I steal your husband?

18:30.580 --> 18:32.775
-As long as I get him back.
-Cross my heart.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.314
Be like half an hour.

18:35.420 --> 18:37.411
-Okay?
-Two secs.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.480
Can I trust him, Iris?

18:40.590 --> 18:42.581
Elden's a boyscout.

18:43.270 --> 18:44.487
And that's Gareth?

18:44.590 --> 18:46.581
[Iris sighs]
Keep your guard up.

18:47.150 --> 18:49.732
He_tries to fuck
anything that moves.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.990
I feel bad for his wife.
I think they're getting
a divorce.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.978
I'm going to get a drink.
Do you want something?

18:56.080 --> 18:58.071
Too much of a lightweight.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.867
It's going to be a long night.

18:59.970 --> 19:01.949
[chuckles] Just wait till
they get oiled up.

19:02.050 --> 19:05.144
You'd think that this crowd
would be too buttoned up
to get down, but...

19:05.250 --> 19:07.241
-[scoffs]
-[chuckles]

19:10.900 --> 19:13.016
[electronic music playing]

19:24.070 --> 19:27.028
[electronic music intensifies]

19:51.060 --> 19:53.051
[music stops]

20:11.920 --> 20:13.911
Spying on the spies?

20:17.250 --> 20:19.241
I got lost.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.321
There it is.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.532
Would you like some pot?

20:26.900 --> 20:28.891
Seriously?

20:29.980 --> 20:31.356
I'm Melanie, by the way.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.234
[coughs]

20:33.340 --> 20:35.149
-Mae. [chuckles]
-Careful.

20:35.260 --> 20:37.262
It's good shit.

20:41.350 --> 20:43.841
[inhaling]

20:43.950 --> 20:45.429
[in Dr. Strangelove's voice]
"Have the women here
been selected

20:45.520 --> 20:49.115
"for sexual characteristics
of a highly stimulating
nature?"

20:50.920 --> 20:52.217
Pardon?

20:52.320 --> 20:54.049
I'm sorry.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.378
-Movie reference.
-[chuckles]

20:56.490 --> 20:58.469
I was not expecting
weed at this party.

20:58.570 --> 21:01.243
Yeah, they tend to be more
of an alcohol and pills set.

21:03.970 --> 21:06.177
I haven't smoked pot
since before my son was born.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.131
I've only been smoking it
for a few months.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.222
Never even tried it in college.

21:15.550 --> 21:18.462
I was always a good girl.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.632
Is that a wig?

21:26.640 --> 21:28.631
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.351
-[chuckles] It's okay.
-I'm very stoned.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.242
I'm no longer in the closet
about dying.

21:36.850 --> 21:38.499
What's your diagnosis?

21:38.610 --> 21:40.601
Grade IV Astrocytoma.

21:43.020 --> 21:46.319
Are you a doctor?
I can tell by the look
on your face.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.411
I'm sorry.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.879
Hmm.

21:50.980 --> 21:52.982
No, I think I'm good.

21:53.350 --> 21:54.282
[Melanie butts out joint]

21:54.390 --> 21:56.381
So what goes on down there?

21:57.110 --> 21:59.442
[Melanie sighs] I Have no idea.

21:59.550 --> 22:01.324
They don't let girls
in their tree house.

22:01.430 --> 22:03.432
[Mae scoffs]

22:04.360 --> 22:06.351
They seem so enthralled.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.897
They look like
a pack of sled dogs.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.161
That's my husband.
He has that effect on people.

22:15.130 --> 22:17.121
Especially men.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.732
[crunching]

22:45.520 --> 22:47.772
[sighs]

22:47.880 --> 22:51.122
Now that the CIA's promoted
you, I suppose you're going
to start praying?

22:51.770 --> 22:53.306
You

22:53.410 --> 22:55.640
were a very good wife tonight.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.931
Were you a good husband?

23:05.460 --> 23:07.451
[exhales] What's that supposed
to mean?

23:09.180 --> 23:11.182
Uh-oh.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.681
Something happened.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.781
That's why you were
so quiet in the car.

23:17.310 --> 23:19.005
I got high with Melanie.

23:19.110 --> 23:21.112
-That's why I was quiet
in the car.
-With who?

23:22.480 --> 23:25.654
-Gareth's wife.
-Gareth Miner's wife's
name is not Melanie.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.012
It's Laura.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.623
Wait, you got high,
as in, you smoked pot?

23:30.730 --> 23:32.721
What did those men
want with you?

23:33.730 --> 23:35.721
What men?

23:36.490 --> 23:38.264
I saw you all
in the Billiard room.

23:38.370 --> 23:39.792
We were just

23:39.900 --> 23:41.754
bating around a few ideas.

23:41.860 --> 23:43.919
-[kissing]
-Ideas?

23:44.020 --> 23:46.272
Yeah.

23:46.380 --> 23:48.382
Yeah, you know I can't talk
to you about this stuff.

23:50.550 --> 23:53.485
But you can talk about it
with Gareth Miner?

23:53.590 --> 23:55.000
-Look, baby--
-Is he in the CIA?

23:55.110 --> 23:57.305
I'm sorry there are things
that I can't share with you.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.654
I had a really bad feeling
about it.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.819
It's because you were
fucking stoned, baby.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.616
No, I had a bad feeling
before I got stoned.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.722
[grunts] Listen to me.

24:08.450 --> 24:10.441
I want you to listen to me.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.041
Everything I do,

24:13.730 --> 24:16.301
every decision that I make,
I ask myself first,

24:16.410 --> 24:18.412
"Is it good for this family?"

24:19.620 --> 24:21.611
You and our two boys,

24:22.460 --> 24:24.451
you'll always come first.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.942
You always WIll.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.541
[exhales deeply]

24:31.790 --> 24:33.781
[breathing heavily]

24:35.550 --> 24:37.598
[screams]

24:40.960 --> 24:42.951
[gasping]

24:45.840 --> 24:47.842
[sobbing]

25:00.620 --> 25:02.975
Mom, [sniffling] hi.

25:05.220 --> 25:07.222
Can you come over here
and stay with the boys?

25:08.990 --> 25:10.981
No, I have to go into work.

25:12.190 --> 25:14.124
No, I know.

25:14.230 --> 25:17.518
I know, but I can't fucking
sleep, and I'm just losing
my shit sitting here. [crying]

25:24.240 --> 25:26.344
And you think your office
was hit because you found
these companies?

25:26.450 --> 25:28.748
Uh, my friend, Sam,

25:28.850 --> 25:31.239
he said it before he died.
He said that...

25:33.090 --> 25:35.092
He said that I found them.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.491
Funny that you still
call him your friend.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.549
Yeah, well,
he save my life, so...

25:41.660 --> 25:42.775
Yeah, well, there's a word
for people who fix

25:42.860 --> 25:44.862
-the problems they create.
-Hey, man, can you focus?

25:46.710 --> 25:49.406
_ He said that he was
g0ing to put me somewhere safe,

25:49.510 --> 25:51.501
until 'it' was all over.

25:53.550 --> 25:55.051
Which means,

25:55.160 --> 25:57.151
-it's not over yet.
-Yeah.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.871
All right, it's your turn.
Who was your source?

26:03.610 --> 26:05.601
Okay, I'm going to
trust you, Joe.

26:07.290 --> 26:09.281
A month ago, I was in Detroit.

26:11.130 --> 26:13.269
Thanks.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.439
[water running]

26:15.540 --> 26:16.393
[turns off tap]

26:16.500 --> 26:18.491
[music playing]

26:22.300 --> 26:24.302
[music gets louder]

26:25.790 --> 26:27.781
[music stops]

26:29.510 --> 26:31.501
-[ voice over computer]
Good
evening, Mr. Wolfe.
-Who is this?

26:32.680 --> 26:35.296
I work for an American
Intell/gence Agency

26:35.400 --> 26:36.776
Which one?

26:36.880 --> 26:39.769
For now, let’s just keep it
general with the specifics.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.814
I have information for you.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.103
What kind?

26:43.210 --> 26:45.940
On September I], a man
name Ammar Nazan}

26:46.050 --> 26:47.699
wﬂl attempt
to release a plague

26:47.810 --> 26:49.266
at ComQuest Field.

26:49.370 --> 26:53.397
He will be killed by federal
agents before the plague
is released.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.719
Nazari will have been found
by a high-profile
target algorithm,

26:56.820 --> 27:01.484
written by a secret program
within the CIA, known as [ER

27:01.590 --> 27:03.478
It's a staged attack.

27:03.590 --> 27:05.444
It's the prologue
to a larger plot.

27:05.550 --> 27:06.767
What kind of plot?

27:06.870 --> 27:08.861
If I told you that
you wou/dn ’t believe me.

27:09.590 --> 27:10.682
Doesn't hurt to try.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.769
This is the only way
I'll do this, Mr. Wolfe.

27:12.880 --> 27:15.075
I'll be in touch
on September 11th.

27:24.650 --> 27:26.345
So he disappeared?

27:26.450 --> 27:28.702
That would be the best case
scenario I'd imagine for him.

27:28.810 --> 27:30.812
Yeah.

27:31.740 --> 27:32.752
[Joe sighs]

27:32.860 --> 27:34.851
Oh, shit.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.760
You know, I knew that Sam
was hooked up

27:41.870 --> 27:44.759
-with that element
in the agency, I just...
-[bottles clinking]

27:44.870 --> 27:48.124
-[fridge door closes]
-...you know, I didn't,
I didn't think he was...

27:48.230 --> 27:50.698
-You know, I didn't think
he was all in.
-[bottle caps opening]

27:50.800 --> 27:52.813
-[caps falling]
-What element?

27:52.920 --> 27:56.731
You know, the joke, the CIA
stands for Christians
In Action.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.661
That's the group that Sam
was hooked up with,

27:59.770 --> 28:04.104
and you know, these guys,
they believe that we're already
engaged in a Holy War

28:04.210 --> 28:06.963
with Islam for control
over the next Millennium,
and,and".

28:08.570 --> 28:09.958
There is no

28:10.060 --> 28:14.156
limit to the amount
of aggre55ion that these
guys can justify

28:14.260 --> 28:16.251
in pursuit of winning that war.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.591
[chuckles]

28:31.960 --> 28:33.951
Drugging you once was enough.

28:39.370 --> 28:42.544
So an element within
the CIA with a hard on
for radical Islam

28:42.650 --> 28:44.379
staged the attack
of ComQuest Field

28:44.490 --> 28:45.980
as a prologue to what?

28:46.090 --> 28:47.876
Some act of aggression
against the terrorists,

28:47.980 --> 28:50.153
-or some
Middle Eastern country?
-[stammers] Maybe.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.251
-That's fucking crazy,
-Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.862
Circumstances aside, it's...

28:58.750 --> 29:00.741
It's fucking good to see you.

29:02.670 --> 29:04.661
It's good to see you, too.

29:05.030 --> 29:06.736
[chuckles]

29:06.840 --> 29:08.831
What the fuck were you thinking
joining the CIA?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.071
We needed you.

29:13.640 --> 29:15.813
I needed you.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.741
-[sighs]
-She was never
the same again, man.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.738
-Janice?
-[door opens]

29:20.850 --> 29:22.340
Who else?

29:22.450 --> 29:24.486
-[door closes]
-[Derek] We gotta get you
outta here.

29:25.290 --> 29:27.429
-I just--
-Now.

29:27.540 --> 29:29.235
Hey! Hey!

29:29.340 --> 29:31.410
-See you soon.
-What's going on?

29:40.110 --> 29:42.101
It's been three hours.

29:44.230 --> 29:46.232
I'd like to call my mother.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.531
I'd like to call my mother
and let her know that I'm okay.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.255
It's the middle of the night.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.816
You can call_her
in the morning.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.229
Her daughter's been kidnapped
by a mass murderer.

29:56.330 --> 29:57.467
I doubt she's sleeping.

29:57.570 --> 29:59.265
[Joubert] Her daughter's safe.

29:59.370 --> 30:01.782
She'll find that out
soon enough.

30:01.890 --> 30:05.337
Are you worried my mother's
going to warn Joe that it's
not safe to come back here?

30:06.900 --> 30:08.674
"Joe-ll

30:08.780 --> 30:10.771
That sounds friendly.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.302
I want to cooperate.

30:16.270 --> 30:18.204
But I haven't slept in days.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.301
So, sleep.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.741
I think I might need
medical attention.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.151
You're fine.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.991
[Joubert sighs]

30:34.530 --> 30:37.226
Let me call my mother,
tell her that I'm safe,

30:37.330 --> 30:39.321
and that I'm with two
federal agents.

30:41.370 --> 30:43.315
I mean, that's what
you are, right?

30:43.420 --> 30:44.830
Even though you said
you were police.

30:44.940 --> 30:46.669
You work _
for the government, right?

30:46.780 --> 30:49.658
Yeah. Well, we say police
'cause people know what
that means.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.876
Sounds better than uh...

30:51.980 --> 30:53.982
"Freeze,
joint task force officer."

30:54.710 --> 30:56.689
[sighs and chuckles]

30:56.790 --> 30:58.781
What are your names?

31:00.030 --> 31:02.021
I'm Boyd Ferris.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.551
And you?

31:07.200 --> 31:08.895
That's Joubert.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.991
Joubert.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.600
Where is Joubert from? Israel?

31:21.250 --> 31:22.956
I'm a lawyer.

31:23.060 --> 31:25.676
You have no legal grounds
for holding me here
against my will.

31:25.780 --> 31:28.931
Let's just stop pretending
you're some innocent bystander
in all this.

31:31.590 --> 31:35.481
I'm sorry. What does that
even mean?

31:35.590 --> 31:38.479
-You dated the suspect.
-We went on one date.

31:38.590 --> 31:41.002
It was a bad date.
It lasted 20 minutes.

31:41.110 --> 31:42.008
And then he walked you home.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.111
And that somehow means
I'm not a victim?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.753
The marks on your wrist
were faded when we found you.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.122
The gag was dry.

31:52.450 --> 31:54.987
You'd been untied
for over an hour.

31:55.090 --> 31:59.504
Which means you weren't
hiding from Joe Turner,
you were hiding from us.

31:59.610 --> 32:02.295
As far as I'm concerned,
you're a suspect.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.411
I want to call my lawyer.

32:06.780 --> 32:08.816
Sit the fuck down, Miss Hale.

32:12.310 --> 32:14.301
[exhales]

32:24.640 --> 32:26.631
[door shuts]

32:38.090 --> 32:42.959
Your phone, gun, binoculars
and bullet-proof vest.

32:43.060 --> 32:46.234
It's like you're some
kind of perverted boyscout.

32:46.340 --> 32:50.162
Gun's unl_oaded._
Bullets are in the Zip
compartment on the side,

32:50.270 --> 32:52.261
in case you need them.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.861
You're just gonna...

32:56.190 --> 32:58.044
Put me out on my ass?

32:58.150 --> 33:00.050
I'm not the one who
put you in this spot.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.855
So you were never gonna
let me stay here, were you?

33:01.960 --> 33:04.417
I didn't want to bring
you here in the first place.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.374
Caleb wanted to hear
what you had to say.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.425
We heard you.
Now we want you gone.

33:08.530 --> 33:10.669
No, no, no. You want me gone.

33:10.770 --> 33:11.668
Not Caleb.

33:11.770 --> 33:13.226
Caleb's too trusting.

33:13.330 --> 33:14.422
That's why he has me.

33:14.530 --> 33:16.339
You know, if you heard what
I just said,

33:16.450 --> 33:19.112
you would know that the CIA
might be planning an attack
against the Muslim world.

33:19.220 --> 33:20.949
You are the CIA, Joe.

33:21.060 --> 33:23.119
No, Janice, I'm not.
Not anymore.

33:23.220 --> 33:25.108
[sighs and chuckles] Oh, my--

33:25.220 --> 33:27.279
People could die.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.848
Now, Caleb has the power
to expose this thing.

33:29.950 --> 33:31.941
People will believe him.

33:32.870 --> 33:34.406
Show me your proof.

33:34.510 --> 33:38.059
Proof. I, I... I don't have
proof, Janice, but if
we work together--

33:38.160 --> 33:40.151
That will never happen.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.151
[exasperated]

33:43.560 --> 33:45.016
You know what? Fine...

33:45.120 --> 33:47.122
[Janice chuckles]

33:49.090 --> 33:51.081
You're just going to
strand me here, too, huh?

33:55.690 --> 33:57.692
[sighs]

33:59.900 --> 34:01.356
It's parked out front.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.451
I won't report it stolen
for 24 hours.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.845
You're welcome.

34:07.950 --> 34:09.804
[footsteps departing]

34:09.910 --> 34:11.605
[door opens]

34:11.710 --> 34:13.086
[whispers] Oh, fuck.

34:13.190 --> 34:15.181
[door closes]

34:22.000 --> 34:23.991
You wanted _to call this
in at first, didn't you?

34:25.000 --> 34:28.140
-Huh? _ _
-You were gonna call this in.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.026
Then she pulled you
into the hallway, and convinced
you to stay here.

34:31.130 --> 34:33.121
To do this alone, right?

34:34.050 --> 34:35.711
What's your point?

34:35.820 --> 34:39.199
She's right. I wasn't tied up
when you got here.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.836
Then why didn't you
call the police?

34:40.940 --> 34:44.626
In fact, Joe and I
spoke at length.

34:46.950 --> 34:50.078
He told me about
the 12 companies
that he found

34:50.190 --> 34:51.680
that invested in Big Pharma

34:51.790 --> 34:54.372
before the attack at
ComQuest Field.

34:54.480 --> 34:58.769
He said, a woman was one
of the people who killed
everyone in his office.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.871
He said she shot him.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.971
And then he described her.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.299
You know the guy killed
11 of his coworkers, right?

35:06.410 --> 35:09.288
I don't think you should give
much credibility to anything
he tells you, sweetheart.

35:10.530 --> 35:12.066
I mean,

35:12.170 --> 35:14.798
he described her.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.891
[suspenseful music playing]

35:22.980 --> 35:26.165
If you really believe that,
isn't it dangerous to tell me?

35:26.270 --> 35:28.807
The way I figure it,
if Joe comes back,

35:28.910 --> 35:30.901
you're gonna have
to kill me anyway.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.137
And him.

35:34.240 --> 35:36.731
Because you have to kill Joe.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.456
So my life kind of depends
on convincing Agent Ferris here

35:39.560 --> 35:41.812
that you're not what
you seem to be.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.184
It shouldn't be too hard.

35:44.290 --> 35:47.805
When you pretty much have
good reasons for everything
you're doing,

35:49.370 --> 35:52.157
except not letting me
call my mother.

35:52.260 --> 35:54.251
I just didn't want
to have to kill her, too.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.691
[laughs]

36:05.910 --> 36:07.901
[car beeps]

36:11.350 --> 36:13.352
[engine starts]

36:15.240 --> 36:17.231
[Joe sighs]

36:28.570 --> 36:30.561
Oh, shit.

36:38.700 --> 36:39.951
Okay,

36:40.060 --> 36:42.278
let's just think this through
for a minute.

36:42.390 --> 36:44.449
And let's say
she is the killer.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.541
Hypothetically.

36:47.310 --> 36:49.608
And she was hired to do
the IEP job,

36:49.710 --> 36:51.098
but Joe got away.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.532
And now, she has to clean up
her own mess.

36:53.640 --> 36:56.256
Okay, then why send the same
killer, when she missed
him once?

36:56.360 --> 36:57.611
She missed him twice.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.335
She tried to kill him again
in Sam Barber's car,

36:59.440 --> 37:02.261
but he got away because
he was wearing
a bullet proof vest

37:02.370 --> 37:04.361
that he bought
at an Army-Naw store.

37:06.570 --> 37:09.266
Well, that is an oddly
specific detail.

37:09.370 --> 37:11.372
How's this for specific.

37:12.540 --> 37:15.270
She met him the night
before the job,

37:15.380 --> 37:17.371
at a bar in Georgetown.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.822
I mean, what the fuck
was that about?

37:24.310 --> 37:26.084
I guess, other than being
a professional killer,

37:26.190 --> 37:28.203
I'm a profoundly disturbed
person who gets off

37:28.310 --> 37:30.312
on fucking men
before I kill them.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.431
I didn't say you fucked him.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.351
I said you met him.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.322
In a bar.

37:40.970 --> 37:42.221
But it's true,

37:42.330 --> 37:45.219
the same woman who shot Joe,
killed everyone in his office,

37:45.330 --> 37:48.549
who he said was Arab
or Israeli.

37:48.660 --> 37:52.118
Who also picked Joe up
at a bar the night before,

37:52.220 --> 37:54.597
went back to his place,
and fucked him.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.816
You fucked him.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.711
How are you going to do it?

38:15.920 --> 38:18.263
How are you going to kill us?

38:18.370 --> 38:20.986
-[Joubert] Sit down.
-Of course,

38:21.090 --> 38:22.978
you're going to make it look
like Joe did it.

38:23.090 --> 38:24.978
Sit.

38:25.090 --> 38:27.092
Down.

38:27.460 --> 38:29.599
Hey, you know what,

38:29.700 --> 38:31.395
you've been at this
long enough.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.797
I'm gonna call it in.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.276
You're not really falling
for this bullshit, are you?

38:34.380 --> 38:36.382
I'm gonna call Marty
and let her know
what's going on--

38:37.830 --> 38:39.240
Why the fuck
did you draw on me?

38:39.350 --> 38:41.284
-I didn't draw on you,
you drew on me.
-Bullshit.

38:41.390 --> 38:43.381
Don't you fucking move!

38:49.960 --> 38:51.655
You weren't gonna let
me make that call, were you?

38:51.760 --> 38:53.296
Don't you fucking move!

38:53.400 --> 38:55.049
Put your gun on the ground.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.549
Get taken in by every
new pussy, don't you?

38:57.650 --> 39:01.040
Don't fucking move.
You put your gun
on the ground, right now.

39:01.610 --> 39:03.601
All right.

39:14.340 --> 39:16.342
[grunts]

39:18.510 --> 39:20.239
[Joe whispers] Kathy.

39:20.350 --> 39:22.329
[gasping] She's upstairs.
She's upstairs.

39:22.430 --> 39:25.274
[panﬁng]

39:31.320 --> 39:33.311
[both panting]

39:34.890 --> 39:36.881
-You came back for me.
-Of course.

39:40.450 --> 39:42.441
[tires screeching]

39:47.700 --> 39:49.691
[dog barking in distance]

39:54.550 --> 39:56.541
Kathy.

39:57.030 --> 39:59.021
Oh, shit.

39:59.670 --> 40:01.558
-[Kathy grunts]
-[Joe] Oh...

40:01.670 --> 40:04.059
-[Kathy groans]
-Put your hand on the wound.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.276
Press down hard. Okay?
Yeah, I know.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.871
Oh, shit.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.375
Uh...
We're going to the hospital.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.563
-[whimpering] No.
They'll get you.
-I don't care.

40:16.690 --> 40:18.681
[Kathy wincing]

40:20.490 --> 40:23.470
[breathing slowly]

40:23.580 --> 40:27.129
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
You all right?
You still with me?

40:28.340 --> 40:30.934
-Kathy!
-I'm, I'm up.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.487
[muffled] I don't think
I'm gonna make--

40:33.590 --> 40:35.126
Don't talk.
Kathy, don't say that.

40:35.230 --> 40:37.221
Talk to me, tell me something.
Come on!

40:38.030 --> 40:39.839
Kathy!

40:39.950 --> 40:41.952
-Her name is Joubert.
-Uh-huh.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.931
Can't believe you slept
with that bitch.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.655
[laughs nervously]

40:47.760 --> 40:49.751
[panﬁng]

40:52.610 --> 40:54.601
Hey.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.641
Yeah?

41:00.170 --> 41:02.172
Don't feel bad, okay?

41:05.620 --> 41:08.350
Kathy, oh, shit!

41:08.460 --> 41:10.519
[gasping] Oh!

41:10.620 --> 41:12.360
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

41:12.470 --> 41:14.085
Wake up. Oh, shit.

41:14.190 --> 41:15.566
Wake up, Kathy.

41:15.670 --> 41:17.661
[tires screeching]

41:17.990 --> 41:19.639
Kathy, hey, hey, hey, wake up.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.729
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

41:21.840 --> 41:25.332
Kathy, wake up.
God damn it!
Wake up!

41:25.440 --> 41:28.489
[crying] Please, wake up.
Please, wake up.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.602
[sobs] Please, wake up.

41:32.650 --> 41:34.959
[sombre music playing]

41:36.090 --> 41:37.705
[doctor] Abdominal contusions.

41:37.810 --> 41:41.211
[indistinct conversation]

41:42.900 --> 41:44.993
Right, clear, you're clear?
All clear?

41:45.100 --> 41:47.091
[nurse] Clear.
[doctor] Clear.

41:50.790 --> 41:52.781
[elevator bells dings]

41:55.910 --> 41:57.901
[indistinct voice over PA]

42:06.120 --> 42:08.111
[door opens]

42:08.890 --> 42:10.881
[door closes]

42:11.930 --> 42:13.921
Mae.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.651
I was hoping you'd come see me.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.634
I'm so sorry.

42:25.740 --> 42:28.459
I'm not going to ask you
how you're doing, because
that's a stupid question.

42:29.470 --> 42:31.461
Thank you.

42:33.950 --> 42:35.941
Would you like some pot?

42:37.310 --> 42:39.312
[sniffles and sighs]

42:41.680 --> 42:43.671
No. I...

42:44.720 --> 42:47.109
No, I just came down here
to ask you a question.

42:48.690 --> 42:50.681
Okay.

42:52.690 --> 42:54.681
I know that we don't...

42:56.370 --> 42:58.531
I know we're not supposed
to talk about...

43:00.780 --> 43:03.055
You know, what makes us
a community.

43:04.860 --> 43:08.466
You want to know if I know
anything about what happened
to your husband?

43:20.120 --> 43:22.156
My theory, lately,

43:24.640 --> 43:26.688
is that I built this rather
large tumor,

43:28.930 --> 43:31.683
out of all the questions
I was afraid to ask my husband.

43:33.090 --> 43:34.705
Isn't that silly?

43:34.810 --> 43:37.495
I was afraid to ask him
what he was doing all
these years.

43:40.740 --> 43:42.674
And it's not because

43:42.780 --> 43:45.180
I was afraid that he would
lie to me. I was...

43:47.190 --> 43:49.181
I knew he would
tell me the truth.

43:52.190 --> 43:55.273
I'm sorry, Mae, I don't know
anything more than you do.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.151
[door opens]

44:02.600 --> 44:04.579
Mae.

44:04.690 --> 44:06.783
[Mae] Reuel.

44:06.890 --> 44:07.868
Let me get out of your way.

44:07.970 --> 44:10.325
No need. I'm just here
to read to Melanie.

44:11.410 --> 44:13.401
No, I have
to get going, anyway.

44:13.930 --> 44:15.932
[Reuel] I'm sorry.

44:18.380 --> 44:20.371
I, I feel...

44:20.900 --> 44:22.936
I feel really badly about
our last visit.

44:32.710 --> 44:34.712
[Mae] I'll see you soon.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.882
What did Mae want?

44:45.730 --> 44:47.789
She was just here for a visit.
