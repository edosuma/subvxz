<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.484 --> 00:06.509
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.586 --> 00:09.487

of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.556 --> 00:11.251
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:16.830 --> 00:19.526
Say it like someone
punched you in the stomach.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.197
Hai!

00:21.635 --> 00:23.330
That was a sumo wrestler
getting a wedgie.

00:24.538 --> 00:26.130
No. Remember? Like this.

00:37.317 --> 00:42.050
We have a great tailor at 86
Lexington, between 24th and 25th.

00:42.789 --> 00:45.587
86 is between
25th and 26th.

00:45.659 --> 00:46.648
You know it?

00:46.727 --> 00:48.592
It's too sexy.
Try on the other one.

00:48.662 --> 00:50.789
Let me see how
it feels in action.

01:02.242 --> 01:04.870
This works.
Not for Ms. Terada.

01:09.950 --> 01:12.885
It belonged to Ms. Terada's
mother, but the stone fell out.

01:12.953 --> 01:16.514
Now Ms. Terada would like to
set a yellow diamond in it.

01:16.590 --> 01:18.751
Fancy vivid VS.

01:19.292 --> 01:23.058
I have about six that
will meet your criteria.

01:31.271 --> 01:33.136
It's broken.

01:33.206 --> 01:35.197
I have one
she could use.

01:41.148 --> 01:43.639
Yossi, are you still showing these?

01:45.185 --> 01:48.154
I'm sorry, Ms. Terada's father
needs to see her urgently.

01:50.090 --> 01:51.853
Thank you very much.

02:03.136 --> 02:05.331
Hershel,
what the hell is this?

02:06.573 --> 02:08.336
Yossi, this is fake!

02:13.880 --> 02:15.177
Oh, baby,
you were awesome.

02:15.248 --> 02:16.510
Chill, Zach.

02:16.583 --> 02:20.075
As chill as I can be for
someone who's about to collect...

02:20.153 --> 02:22.053
Oh! Hey! Oh!

03:15.976 --> 03:18.103
Deceased fits the
description of the jewel thief

03:18.178 --> 03:19.873
that hit Zager's two hours ago.

03:19.946 --> 03:21.880
He had an accomplice, female, Asian.

03:21.948 --> 03:23.813
She didn't
stick around.

03:23.884 --> 03:24.942
He was searched?

03:25.018 --> 03:26.713
Before we made
him as a suspect.

03:26.786 --> 03:28.845
Just thought he
was a medical case.

03:28.922 --> 03:31.755
ID and 600 bucks.
Name's Scott Talbert.

03:31.825 --> 03:34.726
East Asian market analyst
for Goldberg Lynch.

03:34.794 --> 03:36.022
You know
the economy's tanking

03:36.096 --> 03:39.497
when investment bankers start
knocking off jewelry stores.

03:39.566 --> 03:41.295
Small hole
in his jacket.

03:47.574 --> 03:49.474
It's a needle mark. The
paramedics give him anything?

03:49.543 --> 03:50.567
No.

03:50.644 --> 03:53.442
We'll need your people to
search for a syringe or a needle.

03:53.513 --> 03:56.141
Subway platforms,
tracks, trash cans.

03:56.216 --> 03:57.274
Okay.

03:57.817 --> 04:00.411
Perp would've had to get
in close to inject him.

04:00.487 --> 04:01.977
Maybe his accomplice?

04:02.055 --> 04:03.613
She was probably
carrying the diamonds.

04:03.690 --> 04:06.215
I mean, to kill him
here, in a public place,

04:06.293 --> 04:08.352
time was more
important than privacy.

04:08.428 --> 04:10.419
She got rid of him
before they cashed in.

04:10.497 --> 04:13.091
It looks like he
outlived his usefulness.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.657
A disposable partner.
Who would've thought?

04:18.538 --> 04:19.800
Double spectrum.

04:20.406 --> 04:22.136
Real diamonds
only refract once.

04:23.743 --> 04:27.201
They left you three of these duds and
took three of your best yellow diamonds.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.077
A quarter of
a million dollars.

04:29.149 --> 04:31.208
I turned my back
for two seconds.

04:31.284 --> 04:34.913
You're a cautious man, right?
But you trusted this couple.

04:35.522 --> 04:36.853
A well-dressed
Japanese woman

04:36.923 --> 04:39.653
walks in with an American
guy from Goldberg Lynch.

04:39.726 --> 04:42.126
Japanese... Japanese-American,
Japanese from Japan?

04:42.195 --> 04:46.461
From Japan. She had yen in her wallet,
she spoke Japanese to the young man,

04:46.533 --> 04:48.626
and her English,
it was shaky.

04:48.702 --> 04:50.499
He spoke Japanese, too?

04:51.705 --> 04:53.730
Very well, from
what I could tell.

04:53.807 --> 04:57.004
You said she sat here. Did
she touch the counter at all?

04:57.077 --> 04:59.944
She kept her hands folded
in her lap, very ladylike.

05:00.013 --> 05:01.742
And what about her friend?

05:02.549 --> 05:03.709
Just the door handle
when they left.

05:03.783 --> 05:06.775
She started to reach for it first,
but then he got to it in time.

05:06.853 --> 05:08.320
She reached for it?

05:09.689 --> 05:10.781
Yeah.

05:11.591 --> 05:13.616
That's not very ladylike.

05:15.395 --> 05:19.627
The ME said his lungs stopped working
because of a succinylcholine injection.

05:19.699 --> 05:21.963
Goldberg Lynch said they
don't have a Scott Talbert,

05:22.035 --> 05:25.129
which figures, and the
driver's license is a fake.

05:25.205 --> 05:26.433
Look at this.

05:27.874 --> 05:29.136
All right,
look at her hands.

05:29.209 --> 05:31.769
She picks up the three
diamonds, drops the three fakes,

05:31.845 --> 05:34.473
covers her mouth to laugh,
swallows the diamonds.

05:34.547 --> 05:38.415
And she goes home,
maybe takes cod-liver oil,

05:39.419 --> 05:41.683
waits for the
diamonds to pass.

05:41.755 --> 05:44.121
That's an MO you
don't see too often.

05:44.791 --> 05:46.315
Check with our
friends in Japan.

05:46.393 --> 05:48.361
No, she's not
native Japanese.

05:50.830 --> 05:53.628
She reached for the door
before her partner did.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.191
Upper-class Japanese
woman wouldn't do that.

05:56.269 --> 05:57.395
And this...

05:59.706 --> 06:02.937
There, she shrugged.
Japanese women don't shrug.

06:03.877 --> 06:05.401
She's American.

06:05.912 --> 06:09.109
But her partner, he's
got the right body language.

06:09.416 --> 06:14.080
He's deferential to her but
authoritative with the jeweler.

06:14.387 --> 06:17.288
Yeah, he's... He spent
some time in Japan.

06:17.991 --> 06:21.483
His card looks legit,
even if the name's fake.

06:22.495 --> 06:26.761
Maybe the job title isn't. Check
with Goldberg, see who has that job.

06:32.772 --> 06:35.798
That's my card, but someone
else put their name on it.

06:37.010 --> 06:40.207
This person had the card.
You know him?

06:40.780 --> 06:43.044
Right. He came here
for a job interview.

06:43.116 --> 06:46.381
His name is Thaler.
Zach Thaler.

06:47.287 --> 06:48.447
So what's Thaler done?

06:48.521 --> 06:49.852
What would your guess be?

06:49.923 --> 06:52.255
Maybe some trouble
with a girl.

06:53.026 --> 06:55.324
He struck me as kind of a ladies' man.

06:56.796 --> 06:58.161
Zach Thaler.

06:59.866 --> 07:03.734
Taught English in Osaka, Japan
for five years, until last spring.

07:03.837 --> 07:06.965
You were in Osaka for
business last year, right?

07:08.074 --> 07:12.272
That's what they told us in Personnel.
Was Zach your personal guide?

07:12.679 --> 07:15.876
It's just when you eat all
that salty Japanese food,

07:17.817 --> 07:18.943
rings,

07:19.986 --> 07:24.047
you know, especially wedding rings,
they get really tight to wear.

07:25.225 --> 07:26.920
I don't think I have to...
We get it.

07:26.993 --> 07:29.689
What happened in Japan,
stays in Japan.

07:29.963 --> 07:31.897
So Zach showed up here.

07:32.732 --> 07:35.064
Try remembering where he lived.

07:35.535 --> 07:38.595
He was house-sitting a loft,
next to the Puck Building.

07:40.273 --> 07:45.006
"R equals L,
V equals B, T-H equals S."

07:45.879 --> 07:48.939
What do you make of
that? A pronunciation key?

07:49.015 --> 07:51.882
No, there's no "T-H" sound in Japanese.

07:52.185 --> 07:54.176
Substitute the "S"

07:55.321 --> 07:57.812
and "thank you"
becomes "sank you. "

07:57.891 --> 08:01.452
He was teaching her to speak
English with a Japanese accent.

08:01.528 --> 08:03.393
This might be how they met.

08:03.463 --> 08:05.055
He ran an ad,

08:05.131 --> 08:10.728
offering language and cultural instructions
for people doing business in Japan.

08:12.972 --> 08:14.269
She might have
used the mirror

08:14.340 --> 08:17.002
to practice carrying herself
like a native Japanese.

08:17.076 --> 08:19.101
And there were
hooks in the bedroom.

08:19.179 --> 08:21.306
The mirror was
originally in there.

08:21.381 --> 08:24.612
It's heavy. It's odd that they moved it.

08:24.684 --> 08:27.915
Maybe she didn't feel comfortable
with him in the bedroom.

08:40.833 --> 08:44.497
Someone jammed the blinds to
keep them from being pulled down.

08:44.571 --> 08:46.971
Well, there's a nice
view from the art gallery.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.476
Maybe Zach likes putting
on shows for the neighbors.

08:50.543 --> 08:52.670
No, but a true exhibitionist

08:53.980 --> 08:57.211
would've jammed the blinds in
the bedroom, not just these.

09:00.153 --> 09:02.144
<i>A Size 4
designer blouse.</i>

09:02.889 --> 09:05.915
<i>The girl looked like a Size
4. Bargain price, 50 bucks.</i>

09:05.992 --> 09:08.927
There's a couple of consignment
stores in the neighborhood.

09:10.096 --> 09:13.088
Him, I remember, but the
girl had shorter hair.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.591
And I'm not so
good with faces.

09:15.668 --> 09:17.033
Did he call
her by name?

09:17.103 --> 09:18.127
No.

09:18.471 --> 09:22.771
They paid cash for the suit. They
said she needed it for a job interview.

09:22.842 --> 09:25.675
She tried it on in the dressing
room? Did you get a look at her?

09:25.745 --> 09:27.508
Any marks or tattoos?

09:28.181 --> 09:32.049
Just a scrape down her left arm
and a bruise on her left thigh.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.109
Like she'd fallen on that side?

09:35.622 --> 09:38.182
Her body, was it
lean or muscular?

09:38.491 --> 09:41.483
Her legs had the muscles,
especially her calves.

09:41.561 --> 09:43.461
Skater or
a cyclist.

09:44.397 --> 09:45.955
Did she leave the suit
overnight to be hemmed?

09:46.032 --> 09:47.090
Maybe she left
a phone number?

09:47.166 --> 09:48.155
No.

09:48.234 --> 09:52.637
I told her about a tailor we use. She
has a great future as a cab driver.

09:53.373 --> 09:54.772
I gave her
the street number,

09:54.841 --> 09:57.401
right off the top of her head,
she knew the cross streets.

09:57.477 --> 09:59.411
My money says she's a bike messenger.

09:59.479 --> 10:02.710
That's a certain personality
type, non-conformist, independent.

10:02.782 --> 10:03.942
You get that from her?

10:04.017 --> 10:05.951
She was definitely a brat.

10:06.019 --> 10:08.749
She kept doing this
thing to annoy him.

10:08.821 --> 10:10.118
Every time she would try on
an outfit,

10:10.189 --> 10:13.352
she'd do a runway walk
to the front of the store,

10:13.726 --> 10:16.627
and then start voguing
for the pedestrians.

10:21.434 --> 10:25.894
Right up here is where she
did her, you know, "voguing"?

10:25.972 --> 10:28.338
Right there.

10:29.842 --> 10:31.173
Excuse me.

10:35.882 --> 10:38.077
Maybe she's
the exhibitionist?

10:39.285 --> 10:42.049
Yeah, her and
an audience of one,

10:42.322 --> 10:44.552
sitting at the coffee
shop across the street.

10:46.426 --> 10:50.419
In the loft, maybe she was
the one that jammed the blinds,

10:50.496 --> 10:53.693
so that the same person could
watch her from the art gallery.

10:53.766 --> 10:56.462
Maybe a lover, keeping
a tight rein on her.

10:57.236 --> 10:59.500
Yeah,
a lover running the show.

11:03.409 --> 11:06.810
A bike messenger service ID'ed your
daughter, Ella, from those photos.

11:06.879 --> 11:10.315
That bicycle was the closest
thing to a home Ella has.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.810
When was the last time you
talked to your daughter?

11:15.221 --> 11:16.313
Close to a month ago.

11:16.389 --> 11:20.382
You have a number for her, or
maybe you visit her at her squat?

11:21.060 --> 11:24.962
No. The less we know about her
lifestyle, the less we worry.

11:25.531 --> 11:30.833
You both have PhDs in
literature. You're professors?

11:31.404 --> 11:35.704
And these other degrees, for
Thomas Miyazaki, Ella's brother?

11:36.676 --> 11:39.144
And what about Ella?
Where are her certificates?

11:39.212 --> 11:41.612
She didn't even graduate
from high school.

11:43.049 --> 11:46.177
Is that why you've written her off?

11:47.787 --> 11:50.517
Or is there something else that she did?

11:51.791 --> 11:55.090
My wife and I were committed
to having two children.

11:55.228 --> 11:58.322
Then a few years ago,
Kaoru became pregnant.

11:59.565 --> 12:02.625
A decision was made not to
carry the pregnancy to term.

12:03.336 --> 12:05.236
Was this a family secret?

12:05.304 --> 12:08.705
Until a few weeks ago, when Ella
wrote a letter to my parents.

12:09.709 --> 12:13.338
They're very old-fashioned.
It caused us great distress.

12:14.747 --> 12:18.148
For a father who hasn't
seen his daughter in a month,

12:18.418 --> 12:20.613
you don't seem concerned.

12:21.354 --> 12:24.187
She called our son
two days ago in Singapore.

12:24.257 --> 12:25.849
That's where he works.

12:25.925 --> 12:27.324
What did she say to him?

12:27.393 --> 12:30.624
Not much. She asked to
speak to his fiancée.

12:30.963 --> 12:33.727
She's very materialistic.
Not like Ella.

12:33.933 --> 12:37.027
But Tom said they talked
on the phone for an hour.

12:37.737 --> 12:40.900
She might have picked up an
accent from talking to the fiancée.

12:40.973 --> 12:44.841
Her next incarnation might be as
a material girl from Singapore.

12:44.911 --> 12:47.641
This letter to
her grandparents

12:47.713 --> 12:51.080
was most likely her partner's
idea, to isolate her.

12:52.518 --> 12:54.315
He wants control of her.

12:55.254 --> 12:56.949
May be a Pygmalion thing.

12:58.224 --> 12:59.816
He's much older than her.

12:59.892 --> 13:02.417
This girl doesn't know
what she's messing with.

13:02.495 --> 13:05.931
She might be cute as a button, but once
this sugar daddy gets tired of her...

13:05.998 --> 13:07.625
Another
disposable partner.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.099
Go with the Singapore girl,

13:09.168 --> 13:12.001
and put an advisory out to
the Jewelers Association.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.132
I heard around town

13:15.208 --> 13:18.939
that you have the last jasper tennis
bracelet with the one-carat diamonds?

13:19.011 --> 13:20.103
Yeah.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.072
Beautiful piece.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.341
It matches
your earrings.

13:26.786 --> 13:29.084
I love your accent.
Are you from Hong Kong?

13:29.155 --> 13:31.749
No, Singapore.
I flew in last night.

13:33.259 --> 13:36.092
Singapore.
That's my next guess.

13:36.929 --> 13:38.920
There's a ring we just finished
that's in the same style.

13:38.998 --> 13:40.295
I'll go get it.

13:54.714 --> 13:56.648
I can't believe I forgot.
I'm totally late.

13:56.716 --> 13:58.650
Miss... I have a 12:00 massage at Bliss.

13:58.718 --> 14:01.710
I'll come back after.
I really need to relax.

14:06.125 --> 14:08.923
She said Singapore.
Maybe I overreacted.

14:08.995 --> 14:10.656
No appointment at Bliss.

14:11.531 --> 14:13.692
She do anything
before she left?

14:13.766 --> 14:15.131
Maybe look outside?

14:15.201 --> 14:16.225
No.

14:16.302 --> 14:18.566
Her pager went off. It
was clipped to her purse.

14:18.638 --> 14:20.833
Her pager went off right
after he went into the back?

14:20.907 --> 14:22.067
Pretty much.

14:22.942 --> 14:24.637
Her partner
must've been watching.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.940
But not from the street. He
sent her a signal to leave.

14:27.013 --> 14:28.947
But the cases blocked
the view from the street.

14:29.015 --> 14:30.380
She was right here?

14:30.449 --> 14:31.438
Yes.

14:33.553 --> 14:36.920
It's a straight shot from the
second floor across the street.

14:37.723 --> 14:38.883
May I help you?

14:38.958 --> 14:41.222
Was there a man in
here about an hour ago?

14:41.294 --> 14:43.762
I've had one customer
all morning.

14:43.829 --> 14:47.560
A woman who tried on seven different
outfits but didn't buy anything.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.362
She spent the whole time
in the dressing room?

14:49.435 --> 14:50.424
Yes.

14:51.103 --> 14:52.331
What did she look like?

14:52.405 --> 14:54.805
Late 30s, nice figure.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.108
Dark brown hair, glasses.

14:57.176 --> 15:00.009
Lively eyes.
She said she was from LA.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.983
It's a perfect view.

15:12.225 --> 15:14.250
You talked to her?
Yes.

15:14.327 --> 15:18.320
She was curious about my
daughter. I have her picture here.

15:21.434 --> 15:23.163
She's a musician.

15:23.236 --> 15:26.205
This is in London.
There's a London taxi cab.

15:26.272 --> 15:28.001
I'm going to visit
her next month.

15:28.074 --> 15:30.838
She's giving a concert
outside of London, at the...

15:30.910 --> 15:34.778
I forgot the name of the hall, the
Shelbourne, something like that.

15:34.847 --> 15:36.041
The Sheldonian?

15:36.115 --> 15:37.173
Yes, that's it.

15:37.783 --> 15:41.082
The woman from LA said it's
a beautiful old theater.

15:41.854 --> 15:43.481
She knew it?
She'd been there?

15:43.556 --> 15:47.117
Yes. She seemed very cultured.
She had a little accent.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.721
The Sheldonian is in Oxford.

15:50.930 --> 15:53.831
That's right.
This woman was very funny.

15:53.899 --> 15:58.461
She said when she was younger she spent
a couple of weeks there, chasing boys.

16:03.042 --> 16:05.135
That has a familiar
ring to it.

16:06.345 --> 16:07.972
Ella's sugar daddy.

16:09.615 --> 16:11.173
Nicole Wallace.

16:14.553 --> 16:16.145
I could've pulled it off,
Nickie.

16:16.222 --> 16:17.883
He was just getting the bracelet.

16:17.957 --> 16:21.324
I can't risk them
taking you away from me.

16:25.498 --> 16:28.899
I've arranged for us to move
to a new place in a few days,

16:28.968 --> 16:32.062
one that doesn't have
any ties to my ex-husband.

16:32.772 --> 16:35.240
I'm not letting anything
come between us.

16:36.942 --> 16:39.934
Not anything, not anyone.

16:49.422 --> 16:53.256
Nicole and I got divorced two months ago.
I haven't had any contact with her since.

16:53.326 --> 16:55.260
It's not my
business anymore.

16:55.895 --> 16:57.260
You put her
back on the street.

16:57.330 --> 16:58.763
No. A jury did that.

16:58.831 --> 17:00.924
You got her the best
defense money can buy,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.935
and as soon as she was
acquitted, you divorced her.

17:04.002 --> 17:06.972
I think that you realized
you were married to a killer

17:07.039 --> 17:09.371
and were too proud
to admit it.

17:09.974 --> 17:12.136
He always take all of
his defeats this hard?

17:12.211 --> 17:13.337
He's not alone.

17:13.412 --> 17:15.141
Look, the fact
of the matter is,

17:15.214 --> 17:17.808
we got divorced because
I wanted to have children,

17:17.883 --> 17:19.180
and Nicole couldn't
have any.

17:19.251 --> 17:22.015
You know, you once told us
that you'd never give Nicole

17:22.088 --> 17:24.056
a reason to turn on you.

17:25.691 --> 17:27.124
Now you have,

17:27.193 --> 17:29.957
and now you're gonna
need us to protect you.

17:30.029 --> 17:31.963
The last thing
I did for Nicole

17:32.031 --> 17:34.625
was to put her in touch
with a real-estate manager.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.466
He arranged for her to house-sit
apartments while the tenants are away.

17:38.537 --> 17:40.266
This is his number.

17:43.042 --> 17:46.034
Ella Miyazaki?
We need to talk to you.

17:46.112 --> 17:48.546
Your parents filed a
Missing Persons report.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.479
I'm 19.
I'm not a baby.

17:50.549 --> 17:52.813
We understand that, but
we have to follow procedure

17:52.885 --> 17:54.876
and make sure
that you're okay.

17:56.522 --> 17:57.921
Nice scar.
Nice for us.

17:57.990 --> 18:00.686
Looks like the same one you had
during your shopping spree with Zach.

18:00.760 --> 18:04.389
The next part of our procedure,
Ella, you're under arrest.

18:07.967 --> 18:11.130
That's not me. That's
not me. And that's not me.

18:11.504 --> 18:14.268
No, see, they're all
you. And so is this.

18:14.907 --> 18:18.001
This fingerprint was
left in Zach Thaler's loft.

18:18.077 --> 18:20.773
Whoever wiped the place
down missed it.

18:20.846 --> 18:24.373
I know what cops do.
You lie. You fake stuff.

18:25.651 --> 18:28.381
Forget what my parents
told you. I'm not stupid.

18:30.356 --> 18:32.187
They didn't say that you were.

18:32.925 --> 18:35.086
They didn't say that you
were a criminal, either.

18:35.161 --> 18:37.129
This is all new for you.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.388
How did Nicole present it?

18:40.566 --> 18:42.466
A proof of love?

18:43.469 --> 18:46.870
Perpetrate these crimes to
show your devotion to her?

18:48.007 --> 18:50.134
You need to hear what Nicole

18:51.210 --> 18:52.905
has to say about Nicole.

18:53.512 --> 18:57.539
This is from two years ago, when
Nicole was sitting where you are.

18:58.184 --> 19:00.618
<i>If you want to play, then it's
gonna have to be tit-for-tat.</i>

19:00.686 --> 19:04.144
<i>You have to tell me something
true about you, about Nicole.</i>

19:04.223 --> 19:07.158
<i>I did meet Nicole before
I left for England.</i>

19:07.793 --> 19:09.351
<i>She told me things.</i>

19:09.428 --> 19:10.725
<i>What did she tell you?</i>

19:10.796 --> 19:13.321
<i>She told me
that she enjoyed</i>

19:13.399 --> 19:15.458
<i>being under the thumb
of her French boyfriend.</i>

19:15.534 --> 19:18.935
<i>That relinquishing
responsibility to him</i>

19:19.438 --> 19:21.906
<i>gave her
the unimaginable freedom</i>

19:21.974 --> 19:25.808
<i>to commit horrible crimes
without any guilt at all.</i>

19:27.313 --> 19:28.507
<i>My turn.</i>

19:28.581 --> 19:30.549
<i>How old were you
when you first realized</i>

19:30.616 --> 19:34.450
<i>your mommy wasn't like
all the other mommies?</i>

19:35.788 --> 19:36.982
<i>Seven.</i>

19:37.423 --> 19:39.118
<i>Were you ashamed?</i>

19:39.191 --> 19:41.853
<i>And frightened.
Listen, it's my turn.</i>

19:42.094 --> 19:45.063
<i>How old were you when your
father first molested you?</i>

19:45.531 --> 19:48.796
<i>None of those things happened.
None of those things are true.</i>

19:49.101 --> 19:53.595
<i>I am Elizabeth Hitchens. I am
a professor of literature...</i>

19:53.672 --> 19:54.730
<i>No...
... at...</i>

19:54.807 --> 19:59.335
<i>No! When I met you, you wanted
me to know who you truly were.</i>

19:59.411 --> 20:02.437
<i>How smart, how funny,
how charming you were.</i>

20:03.349 --> 20:06.182
<i>You wanted me to know you.
Nicole Wallace.</i>

20:06.252 --> 20:11.155
<i>The sparkling little girl
who survived horrible abuse</i>

20:12.091 --> 20:13.888
<i>with her wits intact.</i>

20:19.999 --> 20:21.466
It's a trick.

20:22.268 --> 20:25.965
It's her ex-husband. Nicole said he'd
use his money to make trouble for us.

20:26.038 --> 20:31.340
He hates us, hates who we are. I
don't have anything to prove to Nicole.

20:33.078 --> 20:38.311
I know that she's overwhelmed
your sense of right and wrong.

20:39.118 --> 20:43.214
Nothing is too insignificant
to escape her attention.

20:46.191 --> 20:50.457
She even has you writing
malicious letters to your family.

20:53.465 --> 20:55.433
Did we make that up, too?

20:56.936 --> 20:59.996
Your grandparents received
a letter from you

21:02.541 --> 21:04.736
about your
mother's abortion.

21:05.911 --> 21:08.072
Would you like to see it?

21:08.147 --> 21:10.274
Say hello to
Ms. Miyazaki's attorney.

21:10.349 --> 21:13.284
Now say goodbye, and
let me talk to my client.

21:18.157 --> 21:19.419
She didn't fall
for the fingerprint.

21:19.491 --> 21:21.220
How'd the saleslady do with the scar?

21:21.293 --> 21:24.126
It's healed some, so it's
not as big as she remembered.

21:24.196 --> 21:27.222
And the jewelers couldn't
pick her out of a line-up.

21:27.299 --> 21:29.290
She came
with the lawyer.

21:33.739 --> 21:36.503
"The greatest detectives
in the world. "

21:38.644 --> 21:43.047
You have to wonder about people who
need so much positive reinforcement.

21:46.418 --> 21:49.319
I missed you at the reading
of the verdict.

21:50.155 --> 21:53.215
Then again, it wasn't
one of your best moments.

21:53.359 --> 21:56.351
Well, none of us have
been at our best lately.

21:58.163 --> 22:01.826
You've gone from multi-millionaires
to street urchins.

22:02.167 --> 22:04.397
It's a step up from Gavin, believe me.

22:04.470 --> 22:07.064
At least you're not calling
yourself Elizabeth Hitchens anymore.

22:07.139 --> 22:09.369
Well, if you
can't beat them...

22:09.942 --> 22:11.705
I meant to tell you,
Detective.

22:11.777 --> 22:15.474
You looked radiant when you
took the stand at my trial.

22:15.547 --> 22:18.812
Speaking of cradles,
it looks like you robbed one.

22:18.884 --> 22:21.079
You're looking for her?

22:23.355 --> 22:29.851
You worried that you didn't inoculate her
thoroughly enough against our "tricks"?

22:29.928 --> 22:33.091
She has a natural immunity
to pathological liars.

22:33.165 --> 22:36.191
Well, I've never
seen you so agitated.

22:37.369 --> 22:41.066
It must be all the pleasant
memories this place brings back.

22:41.140 --> 22:43.973
You'd be more agitated
if you saw Ella's reaction

22:44.043 --> 22:47.240
when we showed her the
letter to her grandparents.

22:50.516 --> 22:53.485
They think that she sent it.

22:53.552 --> 22:55.315
Why wouldn't they?
It's her signature.

22:55.387 --> 22:59.016
It could be her signature,
except the rest of it is typed.

22:59.258 --> 23:02.250
Anybody could have
written it, especially you.

23:04.496 --> 23:08.159
To isolate her, to make
her more dependent on you.

23:08.967 --> 23:11.697
You tried to remake her in your image.

23:12.104 --> 23:17.906
That was the line that she couldn't
cross. So you wrote it yourself.

23:20.612 --> 23:25.879
I didn't come here to engage you.
I want... I want a truce, Bobby.

23:25.951 --> 23:27.612
A truce?
Notwithstanding your...

23:27.686 --> 23:28.812
That's not
in your nature.

23:28.887 --> 23:29.945
...unrelenting
pursuit of evil.

23:30.022 --> 23:35.551
Evil, Nicole, is also
unrelenting in its pursuits.

23:37.062 --> 23:41.055
Your ex-husband,
who actually loved you,

23:43.402 --> 23:45.996
he knew enough to
step away from you.

23:47.506 --> 23:51.237
We divorced for reasons
familiar to many couples.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.437
Because you couldn't bear children?

23:55.314 --> 23:57.305
Is that what he told you?

24:00.319 --> 24:03.777
Obviously I need to remind
him that our divorce agreement

24:03.856 --> 24:07.189
has a confidentiality clause. Excuse me.

24:13.565 --> 24:14.896
Finally.

24:19.004 --> 24:21.495
She's just being taken
down for arraignment.

24:24.676 --> 24:27.110
It'll be fine. We'll be home soon.

24:44.763 --> 24:46.128
She asked
for a truce.

24:46.198 --> 24:48.063
At least she hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

24:48.133 --> 24:50.226
Well, she's lost something.

24:51.870 --> 24:53.963
I smell blood in the water.

24:59.144 --> 25:00.873
I made us some tea.

25:03.682 --> 25:05.741
Are you still cross at me?

25:14.493 --> 25:16.290
If I hadn't
sent the letter,

25:16.361 --> 25:19.990
your parents never would have
shown you their true colors.

25:21.767 --> 25:26.761
And now they have. You're
making me quite sad, darling.

25:37.149 --> 25:41.586
Now, starting tomorrow, we
have something to take care of.

25:44.523 --> 25:47.583
I hope those strong legs
of yours are up to it.

25:52.831 --> 25:54.662
Yes, Mommy, they are.

25:59.004 --> 26:01.097
Ella's back working hard.

26:01.173 --> 26:03.971
She's averaging 30
messenger runs a day.

26:04.443 --> 26:08.106
I guess if you want to be Nicole's
lover, you have to pull your own weight.

26:08.180 --> 26:10.444
You know, I keep going
back to the letter.

26:10.515 --> 26:14.349
The fact that Nicole needed so
much to cut her off from her family,

26:15.654 --> 26:18.885
that's a level of possessiveness
that she hasn't shown.

26:18.957 --> 26:22.859
These logs from the messenger
service, three days in a row this week,

26:22.928 --> 26:25.453
Ella made a delivery
uptown at around 2:00.

26:25.530 --> 26:28.363
Then nothing for an hour and
a half. She just disappears.

26:28.433 --> 26:32.460
And next thing you know, she's all
the way downtown doing a pick-up.

26:32.537 --> 26:34.732
The pick-ups,
where are they?

26:35.474 --> 26:40.673
The Financial District, 12
Stone Street, 27 Broad, 18 Stone.

26:40.746 --> 26:43.112
Gavin Haynes' office
is five blocks away.

26:43.181 --> 26:47.914
Here. Edwin Leeds,
his financial adviser.

26:47.986 --> 26:49.749
It's the corner
of Stone and Broad.

26:51.556 --> 26:54.957
Yes, I saw her coming out of
the stairwell two days ago.

26:55.027 --> 26:56.585
She was looking for an office.

26:56.662 --> 26:59.392
She came up the stairs? All 12 flights?

26:59.464 --> 27:02.592
Well, the elevator's not
very reliable. It gets stuck.

27:02.668 --> 27:05.296
The messengers always
take the stairs.

27:05.837 --> 27:10.069
This envelope for Mr. Haynes,
a messenger is picking it up?

27:10.142 --> 27:13.771
No, he is, this afternoon.
He walks over from his office.

27:13.845 --> 27:15.176
Thank you.

27:18.583 --> 27:22.679
Excuse me. The elevator,
it gets stuck how often?

27:22.754 --> 27:24.051
A few times a week.

27:24.122 --> 27:29.059
It happens every time someone pushes the
up and down call button at the same time.

27:29.828 --> 27:31.022
Thanks.

27:38.170 --> 27:39.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:40.639 --> 27:42.698
That's like a sardine can.

27:44.876 --> 27:46.741
Suffocating.

27:46.812 --> 27:48.643
Especially if you had asthma.

27:51.483 --> 27:53.348
What are you doing here?

27:53.418 --> 27:56.819
Taking the elevator up
to Mr. Leeds' office?

27:56.888 --> 27:59.652
The stairs are a little tricky
for you with your asthma.

27:59.725 --> 28:01.192
That's right.
What's going on?

28:01.259 --> 28:04.285
You ever been on the
elevator when it got stuck?

28:04.363 --> 28:05.591
What happens to
your asthma then?

28:05.664 --> 28:08.224
Well, after 5 or 10 minutes,
I have to use an inhaler.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.927
Nicole ever been on
the elevator with you?

28:10.002 --> 28:11.731
Yes, yes, what...

28:11.803 --> 28:14.067
I caught a glimpse of
her, but she took off.

28:14.139 --> 28:16.403
Were you bumped on
the way over here?

28:16.475 --> 28:18.705
On Wall Street, yeah.
Well, everybody's rushing.

28:18.777 --> 28:23.510
Your inhaler, it's in your
jacket pocket? Do you mind?

28:27.552 --> 28:28.712
It's empty.

28:28.787 --> 28:31.255
I just put a brand-new
vial in this morning.

28:31.323 --> 28:35.054
Nicole's lover bumped you on
the street and switched inhalers.

28:35.127 --> 28:37.425
She was going to follow you in
here. When you got on the elevator,

28:37.496 --> 28:40.556
she'd cause it to get stuck.
Your asthma would kick in.

28:40.632 --> 28:43.624
Without an inhaler,
after 15 minutes...

28:44.169 --> 28:46.694
Oh, my God.
I would have suffocated.

28:54.579 --> 28:56.809
Nicole's not in my will,
she knows it.

28:56.882 --> 28:59.510
I just have no idea what she
would get out of murdering me.

28:59.584 --> 29:01.916
She mentioned
a confidentiality clause.

29:01.987 --> 29:04.785
Is there anything she might have
told you she wouldn't want us to know?

29:04.856 --> 29:06.016
Maybe something personal?

29:06.091 --> 29:08.582
No. Pillow talk
wasn't her style.

29:08.660 --> 29:12.152
What about her infertility? It got a
rise out of her when we brought it up.

29:12.230 --> 29:15.495
Yeah, I'm not surprised. It
was a touchy subject with us.

29:15.967 --> 29:17.696
She ever see a
fertility specialist?

29:17.769 --> 29:20.499
No, she refused. Wouldn't
even go for a consultation.

29:20.572 --> 29:23.268
I even got a referral from my physician,

29:23.341 --> 29:27.072
and Nicole gave me one of her smiles
and said, "Just mind your own business. "

29:27.145 --> 29:30.080
Well, maybe she just didn't
want anybody examining her.

29:31.883 --> 29:34.147
Hey, they're gonna
be up soon in Sydney.

29:35.987 --> 29:37.147
Besides a medical condition,

29:37.222 --> 29:38.621
what else would
an examination show?

29:38.690 --> 29:41.488
A doctor could tell if she'd
had an abortion or given birth.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.551
This is from
the Australians.

29:43.628 --> 29:46.461
Queensland Department
of Birth and Records.

29:46.531 --> 29:49.625
They found a birth
certificate for a baby girl,

29:49.768 --> 29:53.727
born in 1997 to Rohan
Bartlett and Nicole Wallace.

29:54.806 --> 29:58.298
So Nicole has a daughter.
Where is the child?

29:58.710 --> 30:02.339
It doesn't say. But I asked
them to run the father's name.

30:04.716 --> 30:09.449
Here. They found an accident report he
filed with the Brisbane police in 2000.

30:12.691 --> 30:16.889
His daughter was swept out
to sea off Stradbroke Island,

30:16.962 --> 30:19.453
while at the beach with her mother.

30:20.966 --> 30:22.365
The body was never recovered.

30:22.434 --> 30:24.868
This is what she didn't
want Gavin Haynes to know.

30:24.936 --> 30:28.337
And if she had killed Gavin, we never
would have thought to look for a child.

30:28.406 --> 30:29.873
Tragic as this accident is,

30:29.941 --> 30:32.501
it doesn't seem worth
murdering him to keep it secret.

30:32.577 --> 30:36.138
At worst, it makes her out
to be a careless mother.

30:36.214 --> 30:37.977
Well, there's worse.

30:39.684 --> 30:42.983
We need to bring them both
back in, Nicole and Ella.

30:43.255 --> 30:48.124
Well, Ms. Miyazaki was trespassing
in the financial adviser's building.

30:48.193 --> 30:50.525
That's a violation
of her bail.

30:51.530 --> 30:53.430
If her girlfriend's a
suspected diamond thief,

30:53.498 --> 30:55.056
doesn't that make Nicole
Wallace a candidate

30:55.133 --> 30:56.998
for a material
witness warrant?

30:58.436 --> 30:59.835
Trespassing?

31:02.007 --> 31:04.237
Next thing, you'll be
handing out parking tickets.

31:04.309 --> 31:09.042
Come on. Sit down, Nicole. That chair
practically has your name on it by now.

31:12.350 --> 31:16.252
You're both so transparent.
Punishing Ella just to get at me.

31:16.755 --> 31:19.986
That's Nicole's maternal
instinct rearing its little head.

31:20.058 --> 31:23.619
You can't deny those feelings, even
if you can't have kids of your own.

31:23.695 --> 31:25.219
Yes, thank you.

31:25.530 --> 31:29.933
Not all of us can be blessed like
you with eggs ripe and ready for hire.

31:30.135 --> 31:32.296
Tell me, did your sister
let you keep the sonogram,

31:32.370 --> 31:35.100
so you'd have something
to cuddle up with at night?

31:37.075 --> 31:40.238
I see my nephew
three times a week.

31:41.279 --> 31:44.271
Being pregnant was a
great experience, Nicole.

31:45.050 --> 31:47.041
Consider yourself robbed.

31:53.658 --> 31:54.784
<i>Is that what
this girl is for?</i>

31:54.859 --> 31:58.295
<i>To offer you a chance to
exercise your maternal yearnings?</i>

31:58.363 --> 32:01.696
<i>And why not? Adopting Asian
children is all the rage, Bobby.</i>

32:01.766 --> 32:03.631
<i>They're practically
fashion accessories.</i>

32:05.103 --> 32:08.368
Tell me, Nicole, since
it's just the two of us.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.807
Your infertility...

32:15.880 --> 32:20.874
You think it has anything to do with
the abuse you suffered as a child?

32:20.952 --> 32:24.444
You don't listen, do you?
I was not abused.

32:25.557 --> 32:28.390
And since you'll hound
me until I tell you,

32:28.460 --> 32:33.227
I can't conceive because of an infection
I contracted during my misspent youth.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.434
Is that why you refused
to see a specialist?

32:37.502 --> 32:40.960
I didn't refuse.
I just didn't see the point.

32:41.339 --> 32:44.604
People like you and me just aren't
fated to have children, Bobby.

32:44.676 --> 32:46.871
Well, don't count me out, yet.

32:48.179 --> 32:49.976
You know,
I was thinking about

32:50.048 --> 32:53.142
what a specialist can
learn from an examination.

32:54.152 --> 32:56.017
Depending on the
size of the uterus,

32:56.087 --> 32:58.817
they can tell if a woman
has delivered a baby,

32:58.890 --> 33:01.757
even seven years after the fact.

33:10.068 --> 33:11.695
Very good, Bobby.

33:15.507 --> 33:18.442
She's adorable. Where is she?

33:20.745 --> 33:25.375
I decided to leave her with the
good sisters at Mater Hospital.

33:28.119 --> 33:31.213
They placed her with a
nice, middle-class couple.

33:33.224 --> 33:35.215
You never think
of what you missed?

33:35.293 --> 33:38.660
Of course. But she's got
a better life where she is.

33:43.068 --> 33:47.903
I'm sorry for your loss. It was
a year before you left Australia.

33:48.540 --> 33:53.239
The report says that you spent the
whole day alone with her at the beach.

33:56.147 --> 33:58.581
You just looked
away for a moment.

33:59.217 --> 34:02.584
Yes. She loved the water.

34:04.989 --> 34:06.980
Is there comfort in that?

34:07.826 --> 34:11.284
Or is it just cruelly ironic

34:13.063 --> 34:15.589
that you lost
her in the ocean?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.264
I suppose it's a little
of both, isn't it?

34:20.472 --> 34:23.929
And now there's just emptiness and Ella.

34:25.176 --> 34:27.804
No wonder why you
hold her so close.

34:27.879 --> 34:32.612
Your daughter, was she strong
and independent, like Ella?

34:34.052 --> 34:37.351
She was bright, Bobby, like her mother.

34:38.590 --> 34:40.114
But of course.

34:40.759 --> 34:43.592
Close to her father,
you know, daddy's girl?

34:46.231 --> 34:47.822
Aren't they all?

34:49.601 --> 34:52.592
All little girls flirt with their
daddies, is that what you're saying?

34:52.670 --> 34:54.501
Nature of the beast.

34:54.572 --> 34:57.541
Is that what you thought
when you saw them together?

34:57.609 --> 34:59.634
When he stroked her hair,

35:01.179 --> 35:04.444
when she gave him little
baby kisses on his eyelids?

35:05.917 --> 35:10.115
That she was replacing you as the
object of your lover's attention?

35:10.188 --> 35:11.177
She could never.

35:11.256 --> 35:14.851
She was precocious that way,
this three-year-old, wasn't she?

35:14.926 --> 35:16.223
Stop talking about her.

35:16.294 --> 35:17.886
Three years old.

35:19.364 --> 35:21.730
That's how old you were when
your father first molested you.

35:21.800 --> 35:22.858
I won't listen to this.

35:22.934 --> 35:24.959
He said that it
was your fault,

35:25.036 --> 35:26.833
that you seduced him.

35:28.106 --> 35:31.200
That all little girls
flirt with their daddies.

35:31.910 --> 35:36.472
And you believed this big lie. What
other explanation could there be?

35:38.183 --> 35:41.619
Why would your father do
these horrible things to you?

35:41.953 --> 35:45.047
So when you saw your
daughter with her daddy,

35:45.123 --> 35:47.148
how could you not see
her as a sexual rival?

35:47.225 --> 35:48.214
Get out!

35:48.293 --> 35:50.284
How could you not
be jealous of her?

35:51.129 --> 35:54.064
You couldn't allow
her to take your place.

35:54.132 --> 35:55.156
I did not kill her.

35:55.233 --> 35:59.932
And through this whole thing, you
haven't managed one solitary tear for her.

36:00.004 --> 36:01.631
My child drowned.

36:04.275 --> 36:06.800
You're insane to
think anything else.

36:10.882 --> 36:13.976
Who helped you concoct
this theory? Your mother?

36:25.597 --> 36:27.030
In her wildest delusions,

36:27.098 --> 36:29.794
she never spawned
anything like you, Nicole.

36:39.043 --> 36:41.637
I've got a judge's order
for your immediate release.

36:41.713 --> 36:44.614
What about Ella?
You can't let him near her.

36:47.652 --> 36:50.644
Set this place on fire,
I don't care,

36:50.722 --> 36:52.883
but you keep him
away from my girl.

36:58.096 --> 37:01.190
She killed her child,
maybe drowned her.

37:02.567 --> 37:05.001
No body, no witness. She was home free.

37:05.770 --> 37:07.670
A year later,
she leaves Australia.

37:07.739 --> 37:09.900
After she killed Hitchens
and took her money.

37:09.974 --> 37:11.771
But maybe money
wasn't the reason.

37:11.843 --> 37:13.834
Maybe she was after Hitchens' identity.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.280
Because she was on the run from
something catching up to her.

37:19.884 --> 37:22.409
You know the country code,
start dialing.

37:24.789 --> 37:27.087
Nicole Wallace never made
it back to her apartment.

37:27.158 --> 37:28.625
We sent somebody in
there 20 minutes ago.

37:28.693 --> 37:30.422
All of her valuables
were gone.

37:30.495 --> 37:33.896
She probably has a travel bag
stashed somewhere, ready to go.

37:35.333 --> 37:37.426
I need to
talk to the girl.

37:40.004 --> 37:41.301
This is why
she left Australia.

37:41.372 --> 37:44.102
Killing Hitchens was
just her ticket out.

37:48.513 --> 37:50.947
Did she tell
you she lost a child?

37:52.350 --> 37:57.879
Nicole told us that you filled the space
that her daughter left when she died.

37:59.324 --> 38:03.761
All the feelings Nicole had for this
little girl, she now focuses on you.

38:04.562 --> 38:06.530
You're not so different.

38:07.532 --> 38:10.763
You crave
warmth and closeness,

38:11.269 --> 38:13.601
something that you didn't
get from your parents.

38:15.039 --> 38:19.271
You want guidance and
friendship, intimacy.

38:20.979 --> 38:25.507
And you found it all in
Nicole, this bright woman

38:25.750 --> 38:29.982
who always stays one step ahead of
all the people that try to hurt her,

38:34.525 --> 38:36.959
however cruel
she is towards them.

38:37.996 --> 38:41.762
And you feel
immune and protected.

38:45.903 --> 38:47.996
Just like this little girl,

38:51.042 --> 38:53.135
cradled in Nicole's arms.

38:57.248 --> 39:00.945
But there is no safe
place around Nicole.

39:04.088 --> 39:06.989
These are the remains
of a three-year-old girl.

39:07.392 --> 39:09.326
They were dug up by dogs

39:09.394 --> 39:11.123
100 miles from
Stradbroke Island,

39:11.195 --> 39:14.255
a year after Nicole's daughter drowned.

39:14.332 --> 39:16.095
There were no other
three-year-olds reported missing

39:16.167 --> 39:20.103
in that area in the previous two
years. Only Nicole's daughter.

39:24.108 --> 39:28.408
You see this here? This is
a spiral fracture of the arm.

39:29.747 --> 39:33.376
Someone, you know, twisted it.

39:36.254 --> 39:39.155
And here, her neck was broken.

39:42.660 --> 39:48.963
Nicole did this, with her own
hands, because in Nicole's world,

39:52.970 --> 39:54.164
even...

39:56.007 --> 39:57.668
Even her daughter,

39:58.910 --> 40:00.537
her own daughter,

40:02.447 --> 40:04.176
is a threat to her.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.684
That's why she wanted
you to kill Gavin Haynes.

40:08.753 --> 40:12.553
So we'd never dig into her past.
So you would never see this.

40:13.691 --> 40:15.488
She kills her young.

40:16.694 --> 40:19.060
She kills her lovers.

40:19.664 --> 40:22.724
And you? You, Ella?

40:24.969 --> 40:26.368
You're both.

40:28.372 --> 40:33.275
We're willing to offer a plea, but
we'll need her help with Ms. Wallace.

40:41.552 --> 40:44.077
I just wanted her
to be proud of me.

40:54.966 --> 40:58.732
Yes? Darling,
are you all right?

41:00.705 --> 41:03.139
I'm so chuffed
to hear your voice.

41:03.608 --> 41:05.371
No, I'm not at home.

41:06.944 --> 41:10.072
We'll meet later.
I'll have everything ready.

41:11.783 --> 41:13.648
Let me tell you where.

41:17.488 --> 41:19.149
Near Pier 30, 8:00.

41:19.223 --> 41:20.815
Pier 30? There's a helipad.

41:20.892 --> 41:23.725
Wallace might be heading for
the airport. Is she up for this?

41:23.795 --> 41:27.026
She says she wants to do it.
We'll stay as close as possible.

41:46.384 --> 41:47.817
She's inside.
Let's tighten it up.

41:47.885 --> 41:49.819
<i>Nickie, where are you?
Over here, darling!</i>

41:49.887 --> 41:54.153
<i>You made it.
What's this in your pocket?</i>

41:54.225 --> 41:55.522
<i>Nothing.
Just lipstick.</i>

41:57.228 --> 41:59.093
<i>No.
It's a microphone!</i>

42:02.266 --> 42:03.460
<i>No!</i>

42:15.012 --> 42:17.207
All this blood.

42:17.281 --> 42:18.805
Here's the bug.

42:31.529 --> 42:35.363
Your Ms. Wallace must have had
her claws dug in pretty good.

42:36.133 --> 42:37.930
This girl's
trachea's crushed.

42:38.002 --> 42:39.867
When she hit the water,
she didn't have a chance.

42:39.937 --> 42:41.529
And the blood in the room?

42:41.606 --> 42:44.097
Well, it all matched what
we have on file for Wallace.

42:44.175 --> 42:46.166
We estimate there's
a little under a quart.

There's no way Wallace would survive in
the river after losing that much blood.

42:52.016 --> 42:55.952
I guess we'll be seeing her in
somebody's tuna net one of these days.

42:56.020 --> 43:00.184
How long do you think it would have taken
Nicole to collect a quart of her own blood?

43:00.258 --> 43:02.283
If the blood was a set-up,

43:03.494 --> 43:06.554
why wouldn't Ella say something about
it when she saw it all over the room?

43:06.631 --> 43:10.897
Maybe she was in on it.
Maybe we never turned her.

43:12.637 --> 43:15.128
Then she had to
learn the hard way.

43:17.108 --> 43:18.871
It's just a thought.
