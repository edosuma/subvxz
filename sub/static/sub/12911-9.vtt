00:23.437 --> 00:25.039
Silly!

00:27.808 --> 00:29.810
So, what did you do last night?

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.218 --> 00:40.020
I gotta go.

00:53.933 --> 00:55.335
Mom!

00:55.802 --> 00:57.804
Who were you talking to?

00:58.004 --> 01:00.406
Nobody, it was the TV.

01:01.374 --> 01:03.843
I just turned it off.

01:05.043 --> 01:06.445
And what were you watching?

01:07.146 --> 01:08.814
Nothing much...

01:09.015 --> 01:11.016
- I'll make you coffee.
- No coffee.

01:11.217 --> 01:13.819
- We gotta go out, move.
- All right.

01:42.814 --> 01:44.616
Let's see.

01:48.252 --> 01:51.255
You're pretty,
it looks good on you,

01:51.255 --> 01:53.057
we'll take it.

01:53.324 --> 01:55.726
My Lelluccio will love it.

01:56.427 --> 01:58.829
You're happy to see your son again,
Lady Annalisa.

01:58.996 --> 02:02.199
Sure, haven't slept for three days,

02:02.466 --> 02:06.036
when he gets out I'm throwing
a big party, everyone's gotta come.

02:10.841 --> 02:12.843
Smile a little!

02:14.645 --> 02:16.446
Not for me,

02:16.813 --> 02:18.815
for her, or she'll notice.

02:23.653 --> 02:25.855
Wait, let me put these back.

02:39.135 --> 02:42.505
That's 400,
with a special discount for you.

03:04.459 --> 03:06.261
Stop there!

03:26.381 --> 03:28.082
Hey...

03:28.850 --> 03:31.853
Malamore's looking for you,
he wants to talk.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.658
What do I tell him?

03:38.326 --> 03:41.595
Let's wait and see
what Ciro di Marzio's doing.

03:50.270 --> 03:52.473
I loved that dress.

03:54.041 --> 03:56.243
Marinella, I've gotta see you.

03:57.444 --> 03:59.046
Me too.

03:59.246 --> 04:01.248
When can I see you?

04:01.415 --> 04:03.717
I don't know, he's getting out.

04:05.018 --> 04:07.253
You have to do me another favor.

04:08.488 --> 04:10.056
Wait here.

04:18.398 --> 04:21.399
Take Marinella home,
I've got things to do.

04:29.475 --> 04:30.876
Let's go.

05:37.874 --> 05:40.077
I'm taking you away from here.

05:42.813 --> 05:44.514
What are you saying, Mario?

05:44.714 --> 05:46.316
To Veneto.

05:47.484 --> 05:49.052
Where can we go?

05:49.285 --> 05:51.354
We can't go on, don't you see?

05:51.554 --> 05:53.356
It's over.

06:19.481 --> 06:22.885
Anyone who knows anything
has to speak up.

06:25.654 --> 06:28.056
They'll get good money for it.

06:29.691 --> 06:32.093
Once you find Savastano,

06:32.260 --> 06:34.062
what'll you do?

06:34.829 --> 06:37.032
Attack his building,

06:37.999 --> 06:40.201
like you did with Conte,

06:40.668 --> 06:42.670
so you'll all die

06:44.272 --> 06:47.075
and no one's left to go on.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.382
Ciro, wasn't it you who said
it couldn't be done?

06:56.851 --> 06:58.653
It's different now,

07:00.054 --> 07:01.422
we're at war.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.193
But to fight a war,

07:06.393 --> 07:08.595
the army has to be united,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.998
and to be united,

07:11.165 --> 07:13.400
the soldiers have to be satisfied.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.905
Meaning, Annalisa?

07:19.906 --> 07:21.308
Talk.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.177
I heard the Alley kids,

07:24.377 --> 07:26.780
those shits who killed my brother,

07:26.980 --> 07:29.849
they want to take Prince's spot
at the Seven Buildings.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.885
Says who?

07:37.790 --> 07:39.792
My Lelluccio gets out tomorrow.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.696
I thought he could

07:43.896 --> 07:46.299
get the Seven Buildings.

07:46.766 --> 07:48.434
Okay?

07:50.703 --> 07:53.706
So he'll have work, what do you say?

08:07.519 --> 08:09.688
I was thinking the same thing.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.347
Lady Annalisa,
do I wait while you play?

08:39.784 --> 08:41.986
Don't worry, Mario.

08:42.318 --> 08:43.888
Your time's over.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.392
We gotta figure out
who Pietro's messenger is,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.527
who feeds him news.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.465
We have to check everyone:
women, kids.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.536
For now, Dwarf's dealing spot

09:31.238 --> 09:33.940
gets split between Mulatto and Gypsy.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.412
But the Seven Buildings,
Prince's spot,

09:41.014 --> 09:45.085
should go to Lelluccio Magliocca,
Scianel's son.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.220
Why?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.889
Everyone gets something:

09:50.089 --> 09:52.759
Gypsy, Mulatto, Raffaele.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.060
What about us?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.263
After all these wars,
we leave empty handed?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.098
It's all decided.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.668
Do your part,

10:02.802 --> 10:05.805
find Savastano,
so another spot gets freed up,

10:06.005 --> 10:08.007
anyway we split the take
in equal parts.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.542
Yeah, but we always get just 5%!

10:11.610 --> 10:13.412
That can be increased.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.292
Trak,

10:28.226 --> 10:29.594
what do you think?

10:29.828 --> 10:31.596
What's there to think about?

10:31.863 --> 10:32.931
Smoke.

11:18.842 --> 11:21.645
Here's the slut who dishonored us!

11:21.845 --> 11:23.913
Whore!

11:24.147 --> 11:26.149
Slut, you got no shame!

11:29.852 --> 11:31.220
Slut!

11:33.823 --> 11:38.327
What's all the racket?
Leave her alone, what are you doing?

11:39.362 --> 11:40.763
You whore!

12:08.523 --> 12:10.191
When Lelluccio fell in love with you,

12:10.392 --> 12:13.194
he took me to the restaurant
where you were working,

12:13.428 --> 12:15.630
he wanted me to meet you.

12:16.297 --> 12:19.300
You know what I thought
the first time I saw you?

12:19.701 --> 12:21.703
"A waitress is all she is!"

12:23.271 --> 12:25.873
But I didn't say it
out of respect for him,

12:26.073 --> 12:27.875
actually, I said:

12:28.075 --> 12:30.077
"I like her".

12:30.278 --> 12:32.079
It wasn't true.

12:32.646 --> 12:35.049
Only a waitress like you

12:35.249 --> 12:39.453
could cheat on a prince like my son
with that piece of shit.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.622
Now what?

12:42.489 --> 12:44.758
How do we fix it?

12:44.958 --> 12:48.562
How? Now that they all know
my son's a cuckold?

12:49.896 --> 12:52.466
I have to wait
for Lelluccio to get out,

12:52.666 --> 12:55.669
and together we'll decide
what to do with you.

13:00.073 --> 13:02.275
What did you do to Mario?

13:59.497 --> 14:01.299
- Lelluccio!
- Mom!

14:08.039 --> 14:10.107
My heart in the flesh,
you're finally out!

14:10.308 --> 14:12.309
Marinella?

14:12.510 --> 14:15.312
- I have great news.
- Where's Marinella?

14:15.513 --> 14:19.516
Now you have a spot of your own,
the Seven Buildings.

14:19.717 --> 14:22.920
They all wanted it,
but I was smarter than the others.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.322
And now those Alley shitheads

14:25.556 --> 14:27.457
are grinding their teeth.

14:28.692 --> 14:31.662
- Are you happy?
- Where the fuck's Marinella, Mom?

14:40.003 --> 14:42.005
Let's go home.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.078
Now that Lelluccio's back,
we're the strongest again!

14:49.279 --> 14:51.681
Screw whoever hates us!

14:51.881 --> 14:53.449
To Lelluccio!

15:07.696 --> 15:09.498
Another toast.

15:11.266 --> 15:13.068
To the Seven Buildings!

15:13.902 --> 15:15.304
Congratulations!

15:19.107 --> 15:20.108
Where are you going?

15:20.309 --> 15:22.310
Hurray for Lady Annalisa!

15:26.715 --> 15:28.917
You're glad I'm home, aren't you?

15:30.852 --> 15:32.654
I can see that!

15:34.722 --> 15:36.124
You're hurting me.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.526
You hurt me.

15:39.127 --> 15:40.695
Let go of me, please.

15:40.928 --> 15:43.331
I still haven't heard you say
you're sorry.

15:43.898 --> 15:45.299
I'm sorry.

15:47.502 --> 15:51.105
It wasn't easy without you
all this time.

15:51.305 --> 15:53.507
I screwed up.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.509
Please, forgive me.

15:56.110 --> 15:59.680
You know that piece of shit
who put it in your mouth?

15:59.914 --> 16:03.717
They shot him in the balls,
he died like a dog.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.792
You're a piece of shit.

16:12.392 --> 16:14.394
You're crap.

16:14.761 --> 16:18.598
Want to kill me? Go ahead!
I'm dead already.

16:19.132 --> 16:22.335
For seven years I've been walled up
in here with this stink of death

16:22.535 --> 16:25.538
and your ugly mother
always on my back.

16:25.738 --> 16:30.143
Making love with Mario
was the only beautiful thing I did.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.316
I'm not going back to jail
for a slut like you.

16:46.225 --> 16:47.626
Congratulations!

17:43.013 --> 17:45.949
You liked the idea
of the Seven Buildings spot?

17:47.918 --> 17:51.121
Too bad, we're taking it,
there are more of us

17:51.355 --> 17:53.323
and we're hungrier.

17:55.892 --> 17:57.761
I'll crack your skull and piss in it.

17:59.462 --> 18:03.066
Ever think I'd kill you like a dog
after seven years?

18:05.101 --> 18:07.303
Get this piece of shit on his feet.

18:08.771 --> 18:10.573
In the car!

18:13.443 --> 18:14.877
Go!

18:46.741 --> 18:48.543
Stay cool, Riccardo!

18:59.921 --> 19:01.923
What happened to you?

19:02.123 --> 19:03.524
I fell down the stairs,

19:03.725 --> 19:06.727
my friends are taking me
to the Emergency Room.

19:07.228 --> 19:09.196
Get out of the car.

19:19.006 --> 19:20.808
Hands on the roof.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.731
What did they do? What happened?

19:44.731 --> 19:47.133
If the cops hadn't kept me overnight,

19:47.333 --> 19:49.535
I'd be dead.

19:49.535 --> 19:52.138
- Who was it?
- Let's get in the car.

19:58.945 --> 20:00.313
Let's go.

20:02.314 --> 20:03.749
Who was it?

20:03.916 --> 20:05.918
Those fucking Alley kids.

20:06.418 --> 20:08.821
- Pieces of shit!
- Bastards!

20:18.630 --> 20:20.599
- Ciro!
- Annalisa, come in.

20:20.799 --> 20:22.300
I'm in a rush.

20:22.534 --> 20:25.137
You can't play Switzerland
in this war.

20:25.337 --> 20:28.340
I gave you the Seven Buildings,
I want no part of your problems.

20:28.540 --> 20:32.210
You're already part of our problems!

20:32.410 --> 20:34.879
Now decide which side you're on:

20:35.079 --> 20:37.148
either with me or against me.

20:52.330 --> 20:54.532
What the fuck's going on?

20:54.932 --> 20:57.935
Asshole, don't move, stay there!

20:59.169 --> 21:01.972
- Don't move!
- Just shut up and come with us.

21:02.439 --> 21:04.441
Stay there, okay?

21:36.172 --> 21:39.976
That's how you killed my brother
in his own bathroom, right?

22:00.128 --> 22:01.530
And then?

22:02.097 --> 22:05.100
And then you shot him in the head, right?

22:06.201 --> 22:08.103
How much is one shot?

22:08.303 --> 22:09.871
One euro?

22:10.105 --> 22:11.473
Two euros?

22:11.673 --> 22:14.042
And I should spend
all that money on you?

22:15.977 --> 22:17.779
You don't deserve it.

22:18.813 --> 22:20.782
You know something?

22:22.183 --> 22:24.585
I liked killing your brother...

22:28.990 --> 22:31.392
that piece of shit Zecchinetta.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.863
Take another drink of water!

24:27.402 --> 24:29.203
Lelluccio, you're sure?

24:29.871 --> 24:33.674
Seven years in a shithole,
you want to end up in another one?

24:33.874 --> 24:37.278
It's for the best, Mom,
I don't want that whore around me.

24:40.414 --> 24:43.717
Lelluccio, just say the word
and I'll take care of...

24:43.884 --> 24:47.588
Mom, mind your fucking business!
She's my wife!

24:47.788 --> 24:49.857
Stop, I'll deal with this!

24:50.057 --> 24:53.860
She's my wife, she's my woman,
I know what I gotta do.

24:54.061 --> 24:56.663
You're always on my back, stop it!

24:56.863 --> 24:58.665
Calm down, hear me?

24:59.299 --> 25:01.101
Just cool it.

25:13.913 --> 25:17.316
Here we are again,
heart to heart, you and me.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.124
Are you glad Lelluccio had to split?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.095
You don't understand a fuck.

25:34.500 --> 25:38.103
I'm much worse than my son,
I can crush you.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.717
Want the truth?

25:54.386 --> 25:57.188
Women aren't made to be wives,

25:58.156 --> 26:00.558
it's a tough job,

26:01.292 --> 26:03.728
but they make us learn.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.133
Think I wouldn't have liked

26:09.333 --> 26:11.736
to have a life, my own life?

26:12.570 --> 26:15.373
I've always been a free woman,

26:17.808 --> 26:20.111
but all the beatings

26:20.277 --> 26:22.513
made me give in.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.420
In the end,
I've been a good wife and mother.

26:32.356 --> 26:34.424
You can learn too.

26:36.293 --> 26:37.694
Marinella,

26:38.328 --> 26:42.532
a woman has just one way
to be really free:

26:43.700 --> 26:45.502
she mustn't have a husband,

26:48.204 --> 26:50.406
or no longer have one.

27:09.125 --> 27:10.926
Good night.

27:13.128 --> 27:14.530
Good night.

27:49.197 --> 27:50.598
Marinella,

27:51.265 --> 27:52.667
what are you doing?

27:55.403 --> 27:57.405
Nothing, I was at your mother's.

27:58.172 --> 28:00.574
I got laid tonight.

28:03.911 --> 28:05.579
I wanted revenge,

28:05.779 --> 28:07.981
I hadn't had a screw in seven years.

28:08.849 --> 28:10.651
You're happy now?

28:10.851 --> 28:12.252
No,

28:12.719 --> 28:14.721
because she wasn't my woman.

28:17.524 --> 28:19.326
You know something, Marinella?

28:19.526 --> 28:22.529
In prison, Ciro, a friend of mine,

28:22.729 --> 28:26.533
said a man has two happy moments
with a woman:

28:26.866 --> 28:28.668
when he marries her

28:28.868 --> 28:30.670
and when he kills her.

28:38.344 --> 28:41.514
I want to go back to my home,
to my woman.

28:41.948 --> 28:44.717
I have to take back all that's mine.

29:11.977 --> 29:14.145
All it took was a little push

29:14.379 --> 29:16.981
and they're doing it all
by themselves.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.518
We're so close,

29:20.718 --> 29:22.720
then they'll all fall.

29:27.725 --> 29:30.128
I thought something, Don Pietro...

29:32.496 --> 29:33.965
What?

29:34.599 --> 29:37.401
With your permission,
I'd like to see if it works or not.

29:40.805 --> 29:44.008
Try this, it looks made for you.

29:45.209 --> 29:47.011
Wait, I'll see.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.118
I know what they did to you.

29:56.353 --> 29:58.155
I'm your friends.

29:59.156 --> 29:59.856
Marinella,

30:00.957 --> 30:03.760
I'll help you, don't worry.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.429
What do you mean?

30:06.629 --> 30:08.732
Maybe there's a solution.

30:09.866 --> 30:11.467
For what?

30:12.635 --> 30:16.039
Patrizia, help me,
you left me alone!

30:16.239 --> 30:17.640
Come here!

30:17.840 --> 30:19.308
You're right, here I am.

30:19.509 --> 30:22.512
It's swelterin' in here,
turn on some air!

30:22.712 --> 30:26.115
- You have to shorten it a little.
- No problem!

30:27.550 --> 30:28.687
So...

30:40.762 --> 30:44.766
Patrizia, all this way!
I'd have sent someone for it.

30:44.967 --> 30:46.835
No problem, I was passing by.

30:47.035 --> 30:48.637
Thanks a lot.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.962
Here you are.

31:15.162 --> 31:16.964
Want to be free?

31:17.164 --> 31:19.366
Just make one phone call.

31:20.768 --> 31:22.770
Then what happens?

31:30.744 --> 31:32.746
I have to go.

31:32.946 --> 31:34.748
Take care of yourself, Marinella.

32:17.756 --> 32:18.957
Hello?

32:19.158 --> 32:21.026
Darling!

32:21.226 --> 32:23.629
When, tonight? You're sure?

32:25.030 --> 32:27.432
She's right in front of me,

32:27.632 --> 32:30.635
she'll be waiting at home,
if that's what you want...

32:31.303 --> 32:32.904
Be careful!

33:47.977 --> 33:49.478
Answer!

33:50.212 --> 33:51.614
Hello?

33:53.015 --> 33:55.618
<i>I'm Lelluccio Magliocca's wife.</i>

33:56.418 --> 33:58.420
<i>He's coming home.</i>

33:59.621 --> 34:01.223
Here are the guns.

34:01.423 --> 34:03.625
Make it fast, he's not gonna wait.

34:03.825 --> 34:06.828
Here's the phone,
just send a message,

34:07.029 --> 34:09.630
don't call, the number's in here.

34:10.031 --> 34:12.033
- Understand?
- Yes, okay.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.835
Get moving.

34:14.002 --> 34:15.804
Let's go, guys!

34:22.577 --> 34:23.678
Hop on!

35:10.990 --> 35:13.192
Gigione, go in there

35:13.393 --> 35:15.194
and send his wife a message.

35:15.395 --> 35:18.164
When the shits comes out,
just whistle and we'll come.

35:18.398 --> 35:20.199
- When he comes out, I whistle?
- Yeah.

35:20.366 --> 35:21.767
Okay.

35:44.489 --> 35:46.892
GET HIM DOWNSTAIRS

35:56.735 --> 35:58.136
Raffaele!

35:58.470 --> 36:00.138
Hi, Marinella!

36:02.073 --> 36:03.675
What's the matter?

36:04.409 --> 36:06.411
You scare me.

36:07.211 --> 36:09.414
I've been thinking
about you for seven years,

36:11.182 --> 36:12.783
about your scent,

36:12.984 --> 36:14.785
your mouth, your eyes.

36:14.952 --> 36:16.587
You're so beautiful!

36:28.198 --> 36:31.201
I thought about you all the time,
I want to be only with you.

36:36.006 --> 36:38.008
You're serious, Lelluccio?

36:38.809 --> 36:40.811
I don't understand you.

36:41.011 --> 36:44.014
First you want to kill me,
now you want a family with me?

36:46.716 --> 36:48.918
Come here, to your husband.

36:56.059 --> 36:59.529
I want to be with you too,
but let's get out of here.

37:00.296 --> 37:01.964
- When?
- Now.

37:02.165 --> 37:03.766
You're crazy, no!

37:03.966 --> 37:06.769
I've always had
your mother on my back,

37:06.969 --> 37:08.571
she's been so oppressive.

37:08.771 --> 37:11.841
I can't take anymore, I want to live.

37:12.641 --> 37:15.044
I've been imprisoned too,

37:15.244 --> 37:17.846
seven years, like you.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.716
Take me for a walk,

37:20.916 --> 37:22.718
just a walk.

37:34.262 --> 37:36.631
# And you leave me alone #

37:38.633 --> 37:42.637
# You always have a good excuse #

37:44.439 --> 37:47.442
# You're good at making me suffer #

37:49.777 --> 37:53.748
# I'm not a doll #

37:55.049 --> 37:59.653
# That you can leave on a shelf #

38:00.821 --> 38:05.225
# And if you hurt her,
she can't react... #

38:24.244 --> 38:27.847
# You don't realize
I don't know how to cry? #

38:29.249 --> 38:32.852
# You're selfish
and think only about yourself... #

38:39.826 --> 38:41.727
Hey, he's coming down.

38:41.928 --> 38:45.531
# It's past midnight
and you're not back #

38:47.233 --> 38:50.035
# The watch has stopped... #

38:53.639 --> 38:55.240
My bag!

38:55.441 --> 38:57.443
Wait for me outside.

39:53.909 --> 39:55.311
Go!

40:00.683 --> 40:02.284
To Trak!

40:14.596 --> 40:15.964
To you!

40:22.504 --> 40:25.507
Now we'll take the Seven Buildings,
no one can stop us.

40:31.312 --> 40:32.714
Hello?

40:33.915 --> 40:36.084
- They killed the wrong guy.
- What the fuck...?

40:36.317 --> 40:37.585
- Sandro!
- What is it?

40:37.785 --> 40:39.453
Give me the phone.

40:41.656 --> 40:44.458
- Who did you kill, asshole?
- That shit Lelluccio.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.861
We killed a guy
who's not in the System,

40:47.061 --> 40:49.864
it'll be full of cops here tomorrow.

40:50.097 --> 40:52.399
How could I know?
He came out right then!

40:52.566 --> 40:55.369
You're a jerk! You too!

40:57.938 --> 40:59.606
You're all idiots!

41:03.377 --> 41:06.213
Tell Malamore
I have to talk to Don Pietro.

41:08.081 --> 41:09.883
You and I have to split up.

41:10.550 --> 41:12.519
We have to be careful,

41:12.719 --> 41:15.422
until we find out what the fuck
that bitch is doing.

41:16.723 --> 41:18.725
Why that face?

41:19.926 --> 41:22.328
You have to trust me.

41:23.763 --> 41:26.866
We'll take care of everything,
we're the strongest, understand?

41:27.333 --> 41:29.135
I understand, Mom.

41:51.223 --> 41:52.624
Look here!

42:02.534 --> 42:05.136
We gotta break our necks
to get work done.

43:09.699 --> 43:11.500
What the fuck are you doing here?

43:11.667 --> 43:14.503
Don Aniello told me you were coming,
I'm here to welcome you.

43:15.604 --> 43:18.007
Didn't we have a deal, you and me?

43:18.240 --> 43:20.242
I knew you'd screw me
sooner or later.

43:20.442 --> 43:22.444
I don't know
what you're talking about.

43:22.878 --> 43:25.347
You were in with Prince
to fuck me in the ass.

43:26.115 --> 43:29.518
To show your father you're strong,
and better than him.

43:30.519 --> 43:33.322
Too bad your father
assfucked the both of us.

43:34.122 --> 43:37.125
He killed Prince and got Dwarf killed

43:37.325 --> 43:39.928
to set one against the other.

43:44.132 --> 43:46.534
My family's waiting for me.

43:46.801 --> 43:49.404
If your father wins,
you'll always be a kid,

43:49.604 --> 43:51.472
the idiot son.

43:53.741 --> 43:56.511
You and me would have
turned the world upside-down.

43:56.911 --> 43:59.914
You wanted to do it by yourself
but it didn't work out.

44:00.915 --> 44:03.918
We have another chance,
think about it.
