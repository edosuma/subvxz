WEBVTT

00:03.208 --> 00:04.440
Helium.

00:04.442 --> 00:06.276
Yes.
Yes.

00:07.479 --> 00:08.244
Taylor Swift.

00:08.246 --> 00:09.379
Yes.

00:11.021 --> 00:11.703
Pi.

00:11.704 --> 00:13.050
Yes.

00:19.224 --> 00:20.323
Kardashian.

00:20.325 --> 00:22.091
More specific.

00:24.929 --> 00:25.962
Khloe?

00:25.964 --> 00:27.297
Yes!

00:27.299 --> 00:28.331
See, I remembered

00:28.333 --> 00:30.066
because if it looks
like Kim it's Kim,

00:30.068 --> 00:31.634
if it looks kind of
like Kim it's Kourtney,

00:31.636 --> 00:33.336
and if it looks nothing
like Kim it's Khloe.

00:33.338 --> 00:34.537
Oh.

00:34.539 --> 00:35.738
Oh,

00:35.740 --> 00:37.774
that's a Venn Diagram,
and I remember because

00:37.776 --> 00:39.108
I thought to myself,

00:39.110 --> 00:41.110
“Venn is he gonna stop
talking about this diagram?”

00:43.181 --> 00:44.781
What are you guys doing?
Oh, well,

00:44.783 --> 00:46.683
we decided to use
our breakfast time

00:46.685 --> 00:49.319
to expand our respective
knowledge bases.

00:49.321 --> 00:50.553
Oh, let me try.

00:50.555 --> 00:52.622
Okay.

00:52.624 --> 00:56.292
Hmm, atom of hydrogen,
Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.

00:59.197 --> 01:01.297
I'm sorry,
who is Mike Drop?

01:01.299 --> 01:02.598
(chuckles)

01:02.600 --> 01:04.801
Oh, hey, Penny, do you want
to go to the airport

01:04.803 --> 01:06.135
with me later
to pick up my mother?

01:06.137 --> 01:07.170
Sure.
Thanks.

01:07.172 --> 01:08.604
No problem.
Hey, Penny,

01:08.606 --> 01:10.273
um, since you're already
gonna be at the airport,

01:10.275 --> 01:11.441
do I need to go?

01:12.811 --> 01:15.311
Why don't you want to get
your mother from the airport?

01:15.313 --> 01:17.180
Well, I can do without
the 40-minute car ride

01:17.182 --> 01:19.282
where she criticizes
every aspect of my life.

01:19.284 --> 01:22.785
She can cover it
in a car ride?

01:22.787 --> 01:25.688
I could do 40 minutes
on your posture alone.

01:26.624 --> 01:27.890
You really want me to pick up

01:27.892 --> 01:28.891
your mother all by myself?

01:28.893 --> 01:30.626
Hmm, I just feel like

01:30.628 --> 01:32.362
it would be a good chance
for you to bond.

01:32.364 --> 01:33.963
Or a way for you to avoid her?

01:33.965 --> 01:36.265
I don't know what
he's putting on those cards,

01:36.267 --> 01:38.568
but you are smarter than ever.

01:38.570 --> 01:41.738
Fine, if you really want me to,
I will pick your mom up.

01:41.740 --> 01:42.839
Seriously?

01:42.841 --> 01:44.440
Yeah, you know what,
she is my mother-in-law,

01:44.442 --> 01:46.509
and I'd like for us
to have a good relationship.

01:46.511 --> 01:48.444
That is very mature of you,

01:48.446 --> 01:51.280
so I'm gonna go ahead
and say, “Suckah.”

01:51.282 --> 01:54.050
All right, back to learning.
Okay.

01:54.052 --> 01:55.651
(clears throat)

01:55.653 --> 01:57.720
Oh, easy, Bill Nye
the Science Guy.

01:57.722 --> 01:58.955

02:32.507 --> 02:35.108
Did you guys see there's
an <i> Avengers</i> screening?

02:35.110 --> 02:36.931
Joss Whedon's gonna show
some deleted scenes

02:36.932 --> 02:38.698
and do a question
and answer session.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.633
Oh, well, I have
a few questions for him

02:40.635 --> 02:44.337
about the last <i> Avengers</i> movie...
and a whole lot of answers.

02:44.339 --> 02:47.040
When's the screening?

02:47.042 --> 02:49.042
Uh, it's tonight, but it's
first-come, first-served,

02:49.044 --> 02:51.010
so we should probably get
there early and wait in line.

02:51.012 --> 02:52.979
Let's do it. (chuckles)

02:52.981 --> 02:54.547
Penny's busy with my mother,
so I'm in.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.182
Oh, bad news.

02:56.184 --> 02:58.251
Amy's making me go shopping
with her later,

02:58.253 --> 03:00.653
so looks like none of us can go.

03:02.491 --> 03:05.792
You do realize we're allowed
to have fun without you?

03:05.794 --> 03:08.361
In fact, that's usually
the trick to it.

03:10.031 --> 03:11.798
What time do we
need to get there?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.399
Uh, I'd say by 3:00.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.201
You're really going without me?

03:15.203 --> 03:16.202
It's not a big deal.

03:16.204 --> 03:17.504
Go shopping with Amy,

03:17.506 --> 03:18.905
and we'll save
a spot in line for you.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.975
You don't have the authority
to save places in the line.

03:21.977 --> 03:23.276
If I do that, I'll be cutting.

03:23.278 --> 03:25.111
People do it all the time.

03:25.113 --> 03:26.679
You know the golden rule
of line etiquette:

03:26.681 --> 03:29.149
“No cuts, no buts,
no coconuts.”

03:29.151 --> 03:31.151
If you really
care that much,

03:31.153 --> 03:33.853
there are apps now that'll let
you hire people to do stuff

03:33.855 --> 03:36.022
like errands and
wait in lines.

03:36.024 --> 03:39.192
People are actually
waiting in lines as a job?

03:39.194 --> 03:43.596
Boy, makes me feel better
about my life.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.598
Some of these guys make
over $20 an hour.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.901
And now I feel worse again.

03:50.172 --> 03:53.506
I'm not surprised Leonard
chose to avoid picking me up.

03:53.508 --> 03:57.510
He's battled intimacy issues
his whole life.

03:57.512 --> 04:01.047
Does he have difficulty
maintaining erections?

04:01.049 --> 04:03.383
Wow.
(clears throat)

04:03.385 --> 04:05.351
Didn't even make it
out of the parking lot.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.854
Uh, you know what,
enough about Leonard.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.122
Let's talk about you.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.890
What would you like to
do while you're here?

04:10.892 --> 04:12.792
Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.795
You don't have to avoid having
intimate conversations with me.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.199
Well, I'd actually like
for us to be close,

04:19.201 --> 04:21.166
but maybe we start
with our favorite books

04:21.168 --> 04:23.770
and work our way up
to my husband's sex organs.

04:25.674 --> 04:26.973
Very well.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.141
What's the last book
you read?

04:28.143 --> 04:31.845
Um, does <i> Pottery Barn,</i>
<i>Spring</i> count?

04:33.949 --> 04:36.916
Penny, it's only natural to want
your mother-in-law to like you,

04:36.918 --> 04:40.086
and I acknowledge I can be
an intimidating person.

04:40.088 --> 04:43.823
So what can I do to make
this process easier for you?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.124
Uh, for starters,

04:45.126 --> 04:47.260
maybe you can not psychoanalyze
everything I say?

04:47.262 --> 04:49.596
And how does it
make you feel

04:49.598 --> 04:52.665
when I psychoanalyze
everything you say?

04:52.667 --> 04:55.034
Uncomfortable.

04:55.036 --> 04:56.302
That was a joke, dear.

04:56.304 --> 04:57.871
Oh. Sorry.

04:57.873 --> 04:59.672
(chuckles)
Didn't know you made those.

05:01.376 --> 05:03.109
Hey, listen, what
if we have a little

05:03.111 --> 05:06.112
mother-in-law-daughter-in-law
dinner tonight?

05:06.114 --> 05:08.147
So just the two of us?

05:08.149 --> 05:10.683
Or I invite a few girlfriends,

05:10.685 --> 05:12.085
'cause hearing you say
“the two of us”

05:12.087 --> 05:14.354
just sent a chill
right down my spine.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.858
(car door opens)

05:18.860 --> 05:20.860
Hey.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.295
What are you doing here?

05:22.297 --> 05:23.296
You're not Sheldon.

05:23.298 --> 05:26.165
I thought that might come up.

05:27.302 --> 05:29.302
Sheldon hired me to go
shopping with you.

05:29.304 --> 05:31.204
Hold on.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.240
He paid you to get out
of spending time with me?

05:34.242 --> 05:36.542
No, it's not like that.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.312
There's a long line
he'd rather stand in.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.649
So what are we doing?
Old Navy, Build-A-Bear?

05:42.651 --> 05:44.250
I get paid either way.

05:46.321 --> 05:48.354
We're not going
shopping together.

05:48.356 --> 05:50.356
You sure?
I'm happy to hold your bag.

05:50.358 --> 05:53.293
And Sheldon gave me money
for a hotdog on a stick.

05:54.829 --> 05:57.230
Can you understand why
I might be annoyed right now?

05:57.232 --> 06:01.234
(chuckles) Look, lady,
I just work here.

06:03.705 --> 06:07.540
We've waited in a lot of
lines together, haven't we?

06:07.542 --> 06:09.108
Remember when we camped out

06:09.110 --> 06:10.777
for the <i> Doctor Who</i> panel
at Comic-Con?

06:10.779 --> 06:12.779
Yeah, sleeping under the
stars with other fans

06:12.781 --> 06:14.480
who love the show
as much as we do.

06:14.482 --> 06:17.717
Waking up, wondering which one
of those fans stole our wallets.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.454
SHELDON: Stuart,
what are you doing here?

06:21.456 --> 06:23.423
Sheldon, you are the most
inconsiderate person

06:23.425 --> 06:26.326
I have ever met
in my entire life!

06:27.529 --> 06:29.028
Where do you get off sending me

06:29.030 --> 06:31.230
to shop with your girlfriend?!

06:31.232 --> 06:32.532
I don't understand.

06:32.534 --> 06:34.033
You were happy to do this
when I hired you.

06:34.035 --> 06:35.635
Why-why are you
upset with me now?

06:35.637 --> 06:38.972
Oh, I'm not upset with you, but
Amy's pretty bent out of shape,

06:38.974 --> 06:43.276
so she hired me
to let you have it.

06:44.879 --> 06:47.046
Well, I suppose
turnabout is fair play.

06:47.048 --> 06:49.983
You're darn right it's fair
play, you selfish jerk!

06:54.089 --> 06:55.355
You know, just when I think

06:55.357 --> 06:56.889
we're making progress
in our relationship,

06:56.891 --> 06:58.524
we revert to our old patterns

06:58.526 --> 07:00.226
where thoughts and feelings
go unexpressed.

07:00.228 --> 07:01.894
I mean, if he didn't want
to go shopping with me,

07:01.896 --> 07:03.363
why didn't he just say so?

07:03.365 --> 07:07.266
Maybe he couldn't get
a word in edgewise.

07:09.904 --> 07:11.938
I'm sorry, I've been
going on and on.

07:11.940 --> 07:13.573
Oh, it's all right, dear.

07:13.575 --> 07:16.542
Sheldon has a brilliant
and complicated mind.

07:16.544 --> 07:19.579
It's understandable that being
in a relationship with him

07:19.581 --> 07:20.813
could be trying.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.248
I called him “babe” once.

07:22.250 --> 07:25.051
He asked me to get a drug test.

07:26.621 --> 07:28.521
Well, I do admire your resolve.

07:28.523 --> 07:31.157
You're an extraordinary woman.
Thank you.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.526
You know, she's
my mother-in-law.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.261
Why can't I bond
with her like that?

07:35.263 --> 07:38.664
Amy's with Sheldon
who she loves like a son.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.500
You're with her son...

07:40.502 --> 07:43.269
who she doesn't.

07:43.271 --> 07:46.305
Do you realize it took me five
years to get a massage from him?

07:46.307 --> 07:49.976
Oh, well, that still could be
a big step for Sheldon.

07:49.978 --> 07:51.978
Three minutes.

07:51.980 --> 07:54.981
And he used a kitchen timer.

07:54.983 --> 07:57.417
I felt like a soft-boiled egg.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.920
You know, being in a
relationship with Leonard

08:00.922 --> 08:03.056
also comes
with its challenges.

08:03.058 --> 08:04.390
Yes.

08:04.392 --> 08:07.760
Well, what can you do?

08:07.762 --> 08:09.729
(knocking on door)

08:11.232 --> 08:13.299
Maybe it's Sheldon,
here to say he's sorry.

08:13.301 --> 08:16.135
Sheldon says he's sorry.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.374
Bernadette, I'll give you
five dollars to slam the door.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.975
I would have done
it for three.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:32.792 --> 08:35.426
Boy, all this standing's
making me tired.

08:35.428 --> 08:39.296
Good thing I brought
my collapsible stick chair.

08:39.298 --> 08:41.899
Not the stick chair.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.667
You look like an idiot
on that thing.

08:43.669 --> 08:46.036
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

08:46.038 --> 08:48.939
but chairs on sticks
are comfy.

08:49.809 --> 08:51.542
Hey.
Hey.

08:51.544 --> 08:53.711
Is everything
smoothed out with Amy?

08:53.713 --> 08:55.579
Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.

08:55.581 --> 08:58.916
Did you make the apology
as sincere as I would have?

08:58.918 --> 09:01.552
I said,
“Sheldon says he's sorry.”

09:01.554 --> 09:04.455
Oh, well, that's
laying it on a little thick.

09:06.392 --> 09:09.126
You think it's time you
apologize to her yourself?

09:09.128 --> 09:10.694
(sighs)
I suppose so.

09:10.696 --> 09:12.585
But if I get out of the line,
I'll lose my spot.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.186
I'm happy to hold your place
till you get back.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.488
You would do that?

09:16.490 --> 09:18.857
Consider it my way
of getting more of your money.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.727
You're a good man.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.497
So, Beverly,
did you know Penny

09:25.499 --> 09:27.165
is the number
three sales rep

09:27.167 --> 09:28.767
at our pharmaceutical company?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.802
Oh, I didn't realize
you two work together.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.137
Well, we don't exactly.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.272
I'm a microbiologist
for the research team.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.774
Oh, what are you
currently developing?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.809
Some exciting new
anti-anxiety drugs.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.110
That's interesting.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.213
I just attended a lecture
on pediatric anxiety.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.716
Oh, was it, uh,
Dr. Jenofski?

09:44.718 --> 09:45.784
I just saw
his TED Talk!

09:45.786 --> 09:47.018
BEVERLY:
It was.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.653
Let's get back to Penny.

09:48.655 --> 09:49.954
Hey, weren't you telling me

09:49.956 --> 09:51.489
something great
about your company car?

09:51.491 --> 09:52.957
Um...

09:52.959 --> 09:55.026
(clears her throat)

09:55.028 --> 09:58.663
It has seat warmers.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.799
(knocking at door)

10:00.801 --> 10:02.600
SHELDON:
Amy! Amy!

10:02.602 --> 10:04.302
Amy!
Come in.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.937
Hello, everyone.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.339
Oh, Beverly, good to see you!

10:07.341 --> 10:09.107
I'd love to chat,
but there's a line

10:09.109 --> 10:10.975
that could start moving
any minute, so let's do this.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.110
Amy?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.045
A proper apology
requires three steps.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.247
Step one--
an admission of wrongdoing.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.183
Amy, I was wrong.
Step two--

10:18.185 --> 10:20.318
a promise never
to repeat said action.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.021
Amy, that action will never be
repeated, and that's a promise.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.523
Step three-- an earnest request
for forgiveness.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.791
Amy, I hope you can forgive me.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.059
And I hope you
do it right now,

10:28.061 --> 10:29.427
'cause there's an Uber
waiting downstairs,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.062
and I don't want to repeat
this apology nonsense

10:31.064 --> 10:33.198
with my driver Ganesh.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.735
Fine.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.336
Oh, thanks!
You're a peach!

10:38.338 --> 10:39.537
Beverly, we'll
catch up soon.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.839
Bernadette, it was
a pleasure as always,

10:40.841 --> 10:42.407
Penny, you have
spinach in your teeth.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.442
(door closes)

10:44.444 --> 10:47.746
How long have I had spinach
in my teeth?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.214
Since the airport, dear.

10:52.486 --> 10:56.254
You look like you come
with a kickstand.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.556
You can't make me feel bad.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.859
Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.728
So, when the aliens
brought you back,

11:03.730 --> 11:06.097
they just left the probe in?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.000
I'm back.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.969
Hey, how'd it go?
It went well.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.804
Yeah, I've learned that
if you never say you're sorry,

11:12.806 --> 11:16.408
the times you do really
puts them on their heels.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.977
Uh, Stuart, I relieve you
of your line duties.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.279
Anyone else need
anything before I go?

11:21.281 --> 11:24.282
I'll give you a dollar
if make fun of Raj.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.751
That's mean.
Five.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.320
You look like Tigger
if Tigger looked like a jackass.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.391
Uh, if you ever need
a reference or anything,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.460
just let me know.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.061
Hey, guys.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.263
WOMAN:
You made it.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.465
Did you see that?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.634
He just cut the line.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.235
He's just joining
his friends; it's fine.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.804
(stammers)
No, it's not fine.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.106
It is a breach
of line etiquette.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.574
We're near the front
of the line.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.975
We'll get in either way.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.877
What if every person in front
of us lets someone cut?

11:52.879 --> 11:53.417
We'd still get in.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.380
What if each of those people
let someone cut?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.065
Still get in.

11:56.089 --> 11:57.550
But then each of those
people let someone cut?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.484
We'd still get in,
but first I'd hit you

11:59.486 --> 12:01.786
over the head
with his stick chair.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.490
Excuse me.
Oh, please don't.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.725
Uh, uh, I couldn't
help but notice

12:07.727 --> 12:09.461
that you cut the line.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.728
Oh, uh, I'm with my friends.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.729
It's cool.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.931
Well, no.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.466
It's not cool.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.801
If there were
reserved seating,

12:16.803 --> 12:18.703
and we all had tickets,
that would be fine.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.138
But this line is
first-come, first-served.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.540
Not “show up tardy and
nevertheless be first served”.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.808
Right here.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.010
No.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.414
You need to go to
the back of the line.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.250
(scoffs)
Uh, who made you line monitor?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.220
Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.889
And my slogan was
“a line that's straight

12:37.891 --> 12:40.058
is a line that's great”"

12:41.228 --> 12:42.794
Is this guy for real?

12:42.796 --> 12:46.464
Boy, I wish
I could say no.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.502
That was very nice
of Sheldon to apologize.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.604
Well, he's come a long way.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.206
Or a short way very slowly,

12:55.208 --> 12:58.643
so it feels like a long way.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.346
Your relationship
with him is fascinating.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.282
I'm preparing to write a book
on high-achieving couples,

13:04.284 --> 13:06.217
and I would love to
interview the both of you.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.619
Oh, sure.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.420
I'll-I'll talk
to Sheldon about it.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.489
You know, Bernadette's husband
is a former astronaut.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.258
Really?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.359
Do you think
he would be interested

13:14.361 --> 13:15.593
in being interviewed
as well?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.128
Do I think he'd be interested?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.030
Sometimes I hear him
pretending to be interviewed

13:19.032 --> 13:20.999
when he's alone
in the bathroom.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.001
Wonderful!

13:23.003 --> 13:25.270
I'll give you
my contact information.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.474
Um, you should probably
talk to Penny, too.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.744
About what?

13:33.680 --> 13:34.712
Okay, you know what?

13:34.714 --> 13:36.314
This is ridiculous.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.448
I've been trying to make

13:37.450 --> 13:38.583
a connection with you all day,

13:38.585 --> 13:39.851
and clearly I'm getting nowhere.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.953
Well, are you
seeking a connection

13:41.955 --> 13:44.589
or just some form of validation?

13:44.591 --> 13:47.225
What I was seeking was
some sort of friendship.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.794
But at this point, I'll take you
not insulting me to my face.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.130
My intention was never
to insult you.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.498
You've been doing it all day!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.199
Do you even know
what an insult is?!

13:55.201 --> 13:57.168
Well, it's not a clinical term.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.871
But one example would be
your marrying my son,

13:59.873 --> 14:01.573
and not inviting me
or even telling me

14:01.575 --> 14:03.374
the wedding was taking place.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.379
Okay, good example.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.986
What about Joss Whedon's work
makes you think he'd be okay

14:14.988 --> 14:17.021
with rule-breakers
and line-cutters?!

14:17.023 --> 14:18.823
The Avengers are rule-breakers!

14:18.825 --> 14:21.893
Being vengeful is in
their job description!

14:21.895 --> 14:24.662
They work for SHIELD,

14:24.664 --> 14:26.898
which is a sanctioned department
of the U.S. Government!

14:26.900 --> 14:28.566
Do you work for a
sanctioned department

14:28.568 --> 14:30.301
of the U.S. Government?

14:30.303 --> 14:31.736
As a matter of fact I do.

14:31.738 --> 14:35.340
At a little place
called the DMV.

14:36.743 --> 14:37.875
He's got him there.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.479
The D even stands
for department.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.680
Excuse me!

14:42.682 --> 14:43.781
Excuse me,
can I please

14:43.783 --> 14:45.183
see a show of hands?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.819
Who here takes issue with
this person cutting the line?

14:49.589 --> 14:52.056
Told you.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.325
Well, what a sad
state of affairs!

14:54.327 --> 14:56.194
That you've all been
so ground down

14:56.196 --> 14:58.830
by life, you don't even notice
when someone disrespects you.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.465
I can't believe
we're gonna get beat up,

15:00.467 --> 15:04.035
and it's not
because of your chair.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.337
You know, right now,
at the back of this line,

15:06.339 --> 15:08.006
there's a movie fan
like you

15:08.008 --> 15:09.440
who's not going to get in,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.809
because this person
simply doesn't care.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.277
Yeah, well, 61 years ago,

15:13.279 --> 15:15.413
there was another person
at the back of the line

15:15.415 --> 15:17.715
and her name
was Rosa Parks.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.021
Okay, you may have
to pretend you're black

15:23.023 --> 15:26.257
to get us out of here.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.726
Now, let's follow in that
brave woman's footsteps,

15:28.728 --> 15:31.029
and stand up for ourselves!

15:31.031 --> 15:33.531
And-and I realize that she
stood up by remaining seated,

15:33.533 --> 15:35.867
but now is not that time
to enjoy the irony of that.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.435
Now, I ask you again.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.604
Who here takes issue
with this person--?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.739
Why should we listen to you?
You cut the line yourself.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.042
I most certainly did not.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.810
I saw you.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.146
If you're feeling dizzy,

15:48.148 --> 15:50.848
it's because the tables
have turned.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.020
Excuse me, I paid someone
to wait in line for me,

15:56.022 --> 15:57.689
and then
when I arrived,

15:57.691 --> 15:59.490
he left, so what you
saw, my good woman,

15:59.492 --> 16:02.026
was “swapsies”,
not “cutsies”.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.361
Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!

16:03.363 --> 16:04.829
I ask you all again.
A show of hands.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.698
Who here takes issue--?
Well, stop moving!

16:06.700 --> 16:07.665
He's gonna get in!

16:07.667 --> 16:08.933
Buddy, let it go.
No, I can't.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.068
This isn't right.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.135
You did everything you could.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.705
No, I could've done more.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.207
Now, now, you
denigrated the memory

16:16.209 --> 16:17.875
of a great civil
rights pioneer.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.310
That's all anyone could ask.

16:22.348 --> 16:26.350
To be honest, I'm surprised you
cared about the wedding at all.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.286
I'm still human, Penny.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.254
Not getting invited
to my own son's wedding

16:30.256 --> 16:32.190
is difficult to ignore.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.591
AMY:
I know how you feel.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.493
She didn't invite any of us.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.195
It was spur of the moment!

16:37.197 --> 16:40.064
But we did get to see a live
stream of it on the Internet.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.600
I could've watched it
on the Internet?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.804
Thank you.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.641
So if we would have asked you
to come to Vegas

16:50.643 --> 16:53.010
to see us get married,
you would've come?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.980
No, I would've said
you're making a huge mistake.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.916
But an invitation
would've been nice.

16:58.918 --> 17:02.687
You really think
we made a mistake?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.321
At the time I did.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.691
But I-I've never seen
Leonard so happy,

17:06.693 --> 17:09.460
so... perhaps I was wrong.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.561
Wow.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.564
Okay.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.465
Well, um, how about this?

17:15.468 --> 17:16.968
Maybe while
you're still in town,

17:16.970 --> 17:19.871
Leonard and I could have
another small ceremony.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.106
You know, if you're interested.

17:22.108 --> 17:25.710
I would find that
perfectly acceptable.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.612
(gasps) She would find it

17:27.614 --> 17:29.013
perfectly acceptable!

17:29.015 --> 17:31.215
You guys saw it! We bonded!

17:42.838 --> 17:44.104
Howie?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.139
You doing okay?
You've been in there a while.

17:46.141 --> 17:48.375
WOLOWITZ: (stammers)
I'm fine. Be right out.

17:50.512 --> 17:53.480
Am I an American hero?
(chuckles)

17:55.050 --> 17:57.884
Well, that's
a good question, Jim.

17:57.886 --> 18:01.788
Don't you think once
an astronaut leaves the planet,

18:01.790 --> 18:05.158
he's a hero to all the nations
of the Earth?

18:05.160 --> 18:08.628
(toilet flushes)

18:08.630 --> 18:10.330
Okey dokey.

18:10.332 --> 18:11.973
I think I have time
for one more question.
