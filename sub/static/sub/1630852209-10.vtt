WEBVTT

00:00.933 --> 00:03.302
[Gabby] One spoonbill chick
fell from the nest.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.804
[Francis] I would say I'm
definitely pretty close with Sterling.

00:05.806 --> 00:09.274
I love that noise. [laughs]
How are you, handsome?

00:09.276 --> 00:13.579
He's pretty affectionate cause he spent more
time with us, than with other spoonbills.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.782
- Thanks buddy.
- [bird quacks]

00:16.784 --> 00:20.919
<i>[Micah] Working with snakes was probably
the part that I was most nervous about.</i>

00:20.921 --> 00:24.423
<i>But over time, it's my
favorite part of the job.</i>

00:24.425 --> 00:27.426
You do have to be careful
working with these snakes, for sure.

00:29.095 --> 00:32.765
<i>[Sara] Currently we have one male
Matschie's tree-kangaroo at the Bronx.</i>

00:32.767 --> 00:35.067
Hey Handsome.
His name is Artemis.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.602
<i>So we're getting in
a new female.</i>

00:36.604 --> 00:39.238
<i>Hopefully we'll be able to
put them together on exhibit.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:42.508
We'll see how it goes!
I hope he's excited. [laughs]

00:45.412 --> 00:47.980
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child
to draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:47.982 --> 00:51.116
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:51.118 --> 00:54.486
We've gotta take that image
and change it.

00:54.488 --> 00:58.323
They really enjoy this. It strengthens
the bond that we have with these guys.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.126
Come on. I know.
You don't like doors.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.828
[woman] Go on ladies!

01:02.830 --> 01:05.964
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to keep animals
in exhibits just for people to look at.</i>

01:05.966 --> 01:07.900
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:11.203
<i>And for us, it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:11.205 --> 01:12.771
[man] Are we rolling?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.774
<i>[Jim] The general public would
never get the access you're gonna get.</i>

01:15.776 --> 01:17.309
[woman] Good Girl!

01:17.311 --> 01:20.913
<i>[Jim] Which is to see what goes
on behind the scenes, everyday.</i>

01:20.915 --> 01:23.115
That's how we do it here
in the Boogie Down Bronx.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.349
[laughter]

01:34.527 --> 01:36.462
- [child] Hello monkey!
- [camera shutter clicks]

01:40.066 --> 01:41.700
[Sara]
So, we're in Jungle World,

01:41.702 --> 01:45.003
on our way
to the tree kangaroo holding.

01:45.005 --> 01:48.707
Currently we have one male
Matschie's tree-kangaroo at the Bronx.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.209
His name is Artemis.

01:51.177 --> 01:55.214
<i>He was actually born here
and he is about 13 years old,</i>

01:55.216 --> 01:59.184
so I guess middle aged
is a good way of putting it.

01:59.186 --> 02:03.055
<i>He's still very active,
very curious, adventurous.</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:06.024
<i>He's a really cool animal
to work with.</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:09.161
We're gonna be doing
some basic behaviors.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.663
So we got all of this
training supplies.

02:12.899 --> 02:16.135
Hey handsome. Watch your paws.

02:16.137 --> 02:19.271
I think the first thing when
anyone looks at a tree kangaroo,

02:19.273 --> 02:21.039
is just how cute they are.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.341
They look like
a little teddy bear.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.675
Come on down.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.146
Good job honey bun.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.683
<i>The Matschie's tree-kangaroos
are a little smaller</i>

02:31.685 --> 02:34.253
<i>than what you think of
when you think of kangaroos.</i>

02:34.255 --> 02:38.557
<i>They are found in a forested
area in Papa New Guinea.</i>

02:39.526 --> 02:41.460
Artemis, come get this.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.498
There ya go.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.968
<i>I've been working with the tree
kangaroos, just under ten years.</i>

02:49.970 --> 02:52.604
<i>With Artemis,
if I wasn't bonded with him,</i>

02:52.606 --> 02:55.941
he wouldn't let me do
any of the tactiles.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.678
And it definitely takes a while for
you to build up that level of trust.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.648
Whatcha doin'?

03:02.650 --> 03:05.317
<i>It makes me really appreciate
the relationship I have,</i>

03:05.319 --> 03:09.388
knowing that he'll let me do
things that not everyone gets to do.

03:10.423 --> 03:13.358
And he's all set
to go out on exhibit today.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.528
There ya go, buddy.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.065
He does not hesitate.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.037
And now we'll just go upstairs
and check him out.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.972
Make sure he's doing all right
out there.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.377
So, Artemis lives in the
first Jungle World exhibit.

03:32.379 --> 03:36.415
And as you can see, he
lives with Rodrigues fruit bats.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.850
Sometimes they come down
and steal his breakfast.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.120
But they usually fly away
when they see him comin'.

03:43.089 --> 03:45.257
And he is a solitary animal.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.926
A lot of people ask us
why he's here all by himself.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.361
That's how
they live in the wild.

03:49.363 --> 03:53.465
They come together for breeding
and then they kind of separate

03:53.467 --> 03:54.600
and live their own lives.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.272
We're getting in a new female
which is really exciting.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.808
Hopefully we will be able to
put them together at some point,

04:02.810 --> 04:04.943
to allow them to breed.

04:04.945 --> 04:09.281
We'll see how it goes, but it's
exciting and I hope he's excited.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.582
[laughs]

04:22.962 --> 04:24.896
[Micah] I'm heading over
to the health center

04:24.898 --> 04:27.599
to take care of some
Mang pit vipers that we have.

04:28.668 --> 04:31.270
<i>Last summer we had
a pretty large confiscation</i>

04:31.272 --> 04:33.438
<i>of a number of venomous snakes.</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.341
<i>[Jesse] We had a gentleman who's bit
by a venomous snake over the weekend.</i>

04:36.343 --> 04:38.510
<i>After speaking with him,</i>

04:38.512 --> 04:41.446
we found out that he had
a lot more snakes in his home.

04:41.448 --> 04:46.118
<i>[Jim] This is crazy. We were told that
there was approximately 50 snakes.</i>

04:46.120 --> 04:47.919
<i>Now, when we got here
on site today,</i>

04:47.921 --> 04:51.490
we heard that there may be
at least twice that many.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.693
[Micah] These two mang vipers
are still here.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.895
And today we have some rats
for them to eat.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.097
So, I bet they'll be
pretty excited about that.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.066
All these snakes are venomous.

05:02.502 --> 05:06.571
So, you do have to be careful
working these snakes, for sure.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.275
The two snakes
I'll be working with today are

05:10.277 --> 05:13.779
female here and a male
right in front of me.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.848
They're two
Mang Mountain vipers.

05:16.850 --> 05:21.787
Mang Mountain vipers are a species
of pit viper found in forests in China.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.189
They can reach pretty far
when they strike.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.692
Most snakes have a strike
range somewhere in one third,

05:26.694 --> 05:28.093
to one half their body length.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.696
So, if you have
a six foot snake,

05:30.698 --> 05:34.466
you have to imagine that they have somewhere
between two and three feet of reach.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.949
That went all right.

05:52.251 --> 05:56.788
I really never imagined I'd be
doing something like this as my job.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.224
After working here
for a period of time,

05:59.226 --> 06:02.394
I actually enjoyed working
with venomous snakes so much

06:02.396 --> 06:04.763
that I decided
to get a tattoo of one.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.164
The timber rattlesnake,

06:06.166 --> 06:10.035
which is a native venomous
snake species to New York.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.438
I started out really nervous
to do this job.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.707
But I committed to it.

06:15.709 --> 06:21.079
<i>And I spent a lot of time learning,
asking questions, asking for help.</i>

06:21.081 --> 06:25.016
<i>And committing
to do the best that I can.</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:26.985
It's nice to have that reminder.

06:28.254 --> 06:31.323
Right now these two Mang
Mountain vipers are living here,

06:31.325 --> 06:33.258
at the health center.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.461
But, we're working on a new
exhibit for them over at Reptile House.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.163
[drill whirring]

06:38.165 --> 06:41.400
[Emily] So, this is gonna have
a ceramic bulb in it

06:41.402 --> 06:45.837
that will radiate
so the whole rock will be hot.

06:45.839 --> 06:50.308
Which is why though we had to
change it from epoxy to cement.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.878
Most snakes
love basking on hot rocks.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.880
But from what I've read
about this guy,

06:54.882 --> 06:57.349
he likes the cold
and then hot rocks.

06:58.885 --> 07:02.387
They'll be moving from these separate
enclosures, into an exhibit together.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.157
Which gives them the
opportunity to potentially breed.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.625
Which'd be
really exciting for us.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.860
So hopefully in the near future,

07:08.862 --> 07:11.430
we'll be moving them over and
have them on view for the public.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.433
And I think it'll be a great opportunity
for people to see these snakes

07:14.435 --> 07:16.034
and learn more about them.

07:18.905 --> 07:21.306
- [children chatting]
- Over here!

07:22.341 --> 07:23.942
He's waggin' his tail.

07:26.112 --> 07:30.415
[Gabby] I'm doing my AM check
and AM feed in the marsh exhibit.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.654
[whistles]

07:38.825 --> 07:42.194
- [birds chirp]
- [whistles]

07:43.196 --> 07:47.766
We have a group
of African spoonbills,

07:47.768 --> 07:52.704
and they are a species of bird
that's native to regions of Africa.

07:52.706 --> 07:59.277
And as their name suggests, their
bill is almost shaped like a spoon.

07:59.279 --> 08:07.279
This year we've had a number of
spoonbill chicks hatch out in this exhibit.

08:07.421 --> 08:13.692
One chick fell from the nest and was
taken to World Birds and the Brita Room

08:13.694 --> 08:16.094
where the keepers there
are raising it.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.433
[Francis] He's gonna get some
slop, some chopped fish,

08:21.435 --> 08:23.368
some meat balls.
These ones are his favorite.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.437
And we're gonna grab him
a water bowl as well.

08:26.939 --> 08:28.139
Hi, Sterling!

08:29.041 --> 08:31.977
- Hey buddy.
- [bird quacks]

08:31.979 --> 08:35.046
This is Sterling. He's only
a couple of months old.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.349
So, he's just a baby.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.684
Sterling was found
tossed from his nest.

08:39.686 --> 08:44.256
In the case where a bird lays
more than one egg,

08:44.258 --> 08:48.360
the parents might reject the egg or
the hatchling for whatever reason.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.928
<i>This is something natural
that happens.</i>

08:49.930 --> 08:54.666
<i>The babies themselves also might
toss each other, in competitiveness.</i>

08:54.668 --> 08:58.069
<i>This is one of the reasons why we keep
a close eye on nests and on hatchlings,</i>

08:58.071 --> 09:02.140
in order to be able
to intervene if we're needed.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.911
He's pretty affectionate cause
he spent more time with us

09:05.913 --> 09:09.147
than with other spoonbills
and is pretty personable.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.683
It's definitely nice
to start a day with an animal

09:11.685 --> 09:14.386
whose just as happy to see you
as you are to see them.

09:15.855 --> 09:17.689
All right, come on Sterling.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.291
Time to clean up. Good boy.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.259
There ya go.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.963
<i>We change out those mats
every morning.</i>

09:24.965 --> 09:27.299
<i>Give his enclosure
a little hose down.</i>

09:27.301 --> 09:29.568
<i>And it gives him a good chance
to get some exercise as well.</i>

09:31.370 --> 09:34.539
There we go! Yeah.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.042
There you go.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.078
A lot of young birds
will do stuff like this.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.348
Kinda catching gusts of wind
to help build up muscles

09:43.350 --> 09:45.584
that will actually
help carry them in flight.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.686
<i>It's an interesting
predicament because,</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:52.691
we would always prefer that an animal
be able to be with others of its own kind.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.893
<i>But he's more accustomed
to being around us,</i>

09:54.895 --> 09:57.228
then he would be
around his own family.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.664
I would say I'm definitely
pretty close with Sterling.

09:59.666 --> 10:04.102
At this stage his feathers and my
hair probably feel about the same.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.039
He'll groom my eyebrows, he likes all the
little things that he can kinda get over--

10:08.041 --> 10:09.441
Get through his bill.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.609
Thanks buddy.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.679
I've been interested in animals
basically, since before I could speak.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.082
<i>I remember coming here
to the zoo as a kid</i>

10:17.084 --> 10:19.317
and saying like,
I want to be there someday.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.886
And so it's really great
to be able to be here

10:21.888 --> 10:25.991
and then to also have such a unique
experience with an animal like Sterling.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.326
All right. You ready?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.297
There you go.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.800
He's gonna ruin all my hard
work and make a big mess.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.670
Some possibilities is, he could
go back to our aquatic bird house

10:38.672 --> 10:41.573
and be with other spoonbills,
or he could go on to become

10:41.575 --> 10:44.342
an ambassador animal
here at the zoo.

10:44.344 --> 10:48.380
In a case where you are hand raising
an animal, they might learn behaviors

10:48.382 --> 10:52.083
that are not quite spoonbill
behaviors, for example.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.220
So he might not be able
to connect with other birds.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.722
<i>That's something
that we do have to monitor.</i>

10:57.724 --> 11:01.960
All right. I gotta go.
Bye-bye, baby.

11:03.529 --> 11:08.133
So we finally got our rock for
our Mang vipers. It looks awesome.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.835
[Micah] I think it'll be really
exciting to see what our brand-new

11:10.837 --> 11:14.039
Mang Mountain viper exhibit looks
like once this paper comes down.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.177
We're getting ready to receive
the young female tree kangaroo.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.414
[Jessica] Hi, Artemis!
You got a girlfriend.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.021
The turtle! Look at him.

11:37.329 --> 11:40.432
<i>[Micah] This section of the reptile
house is what we call North Passage.</i>

11:40.434 --> 11:43.601
<i>What I'm trying to do is
just see where everyone is,</i>

11:43.603 --> 11:46.571
<i>make sure everyone looks
healthy in their exhibit.</i>

11:49.375 --> 11:55.046
This will be the location of our
brand-new Mang Mountain viper exhibit.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.382
So, the exhibit's chap is
still building the rock work

11:57.384 --> 11:59.084
that's gonna go in this exhibit.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.920
And then painting and so, I
think it'll be really exciting to see

12:01.922 --> 12:03.988
what is looks like
once this paper comes down.

12:03.990 --> 12:08.460
<i>To be able to give these two
individual animals this new space,</i>

12:08.462 --> 12:11.129
it's really satisfying and I
know it's just two snakes,

12:11.131 --> 12:13.465
but that feels really great.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.067
[golf cart beeping]

12:19.271 --> 12:21.172
[Emily] I've been working
on some new features

12:21.174 --> 12:24.542
for the Mang Mountain viper
exhibit at Reptile House.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.612
And we are installing
the rock feature.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.049
Oh, geez.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.322
<i>I totally did some nerding out.</i>

12:37.324 --> 12:40.725
Researching where they live,
the habitat.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.362
<i>It's like this very specific region
of the Hunan province in China.</i>

12:44.364 --> 12:48.066
<i>I used that as the basis
for making the rock.</i>

12:50.803 --> 12:53.905
<i>It feels really good to see
your work go on exhibit</i>

12:53.907 --> 12:57.509
because you're not only
improving the animals' habitat,

12:57.511 --> 12:59.844
you're enhancing
viewer experience

12:59.846 --> 13:03.314
<i>and you're doing your part for
conservation and that's really great.</i>

13:04.884 --> 13:08.787
This mural is two-dimensional,
but we try to make it

13:08.789 --> 13:12.590
look as three-dimensional
and as expansive as possible.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.799
We want to get it as close
to their natural habitat.

13:20.801 --> 13:25.336
So when I painted, I painted
mostly like, facing this way.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.439
Because I know the viewer is
going to mostly be looking this way.

13:30.342 --> 13:34.212
Looking forward to the moment
when they are in the exhibit.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.682
And see if they
like the heated rock.

13:37.684 --> 13:41.519
Hopefully they feel at home
in their space here.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.094
- [woman] Hello!
- [child] Hello!

13:51.130 --> 13:52.997
- [Brandon] What do you think?
- [Sara] I like that one.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.532
- [Brandon] Yeah.
- [Sara] And then this one,

13:54.534 --> 13:57.435
- might be the perfect height for one of those shelves.
- [Brandon] Okay.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.838
[Sara] And that'll also
give her some sitting option.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.339
- Yeah.
- [chainsaw whirring]

14:04.877 --> 14:06.477
All right.
I'll meet you in there.

14:08.113 --> 14:11.115
<i>[Brandon] We're getting ready to
receive a young female tree kangaroo</i>

14:11.117 --> 14:13.351
<i>from the
San Diego Zoo Safari Park.</i>

14:13.353 --> 14:15.053
[Sara] Comin' through!

14:15.055 --> 14:16.855
<i>[Brandon] Today we're getting
her enclosure ready,</i>

14:16.857 --> 14:20.158
were putting together
what we call 'perching'.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.128
<i>Tree kangaroos are arboreal. So,
we like to provide them with something</i>

14:24.130 --> 14:28.867
<i>that's somewhat close to what
they would be climbing on in the wild.</i>

14:28.869 --> 14:33.671
<i>It's not an exhibit space, so we're
not as concerned with the aesthetics.</i>

14:33.673 --> 14:35.340
<i>It's more just
the functionality.</i>

14:35.342 --> 14:37.408
<i>Just to give her some options.</i>

14:39.345 --> 14:41.679
[Sara] I know
she likes to be up high.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.282
So I was wondering if maybe
we could get something from here,

14:44.284 --> 14:46.918
- to like an anchor up there?
- Sure. Yeah.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.586
We gotta get it right,
just for her.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.724
I like it cause she has a
little bit of a seat right there.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.459
I think she's gonna love it.

14:56.228 --> 15:00.531
I'm really pleased. So all that's
left now is just the kangaroo.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.615
- Thanks.
- Yep.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.920
[Jessica] <i>Matschie's tree-kangaroos
are listed as endangered.</i>

15:21.922 --> 15:25.023
<i>Like pretty much all tropical
forest dwelling species,</i>

15:25.025 --> 15:27.625
they're threatened
by hunting and habitat loss.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.994
<i>So, it's really exciting
to have Polly here,</i>

15:29.996 --> 15:35.199
<i>because it's been a while since
we've had a breeding situation here.</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:41.272
<i>I hope that her and Artemis get along
really well. And I hope that they breed.</i>

15:42.074 --> 15:46.044
Hi, Artemis!
You got a girlfriend.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.113
<i>You know, the fact that we
do have that possibility now</i>

15:49.115 --> 15:52.283
<i>means that, you know, we have a
better chance of continuing to maintain</i>

15:52.285 --> 15:54.218
<i>the species
here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

15:56.455 --> 15:57.622
Hey, sweetie.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.199
There she goes.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.937
[laughs] Hi, sweetie!

16:14.206 --> 16:15.539
How was your flight?

16:20.813 --> 16:25.183
[Sara] It's really exciting, not
only just have a new animal but,

16:25.185 --> 16:28.052
one of the animals that I
get to work with pretty closely.

16:31.957 --> 16:37.462
I like how calm she seems. And comfortable
to get around in a new enclosure.

16:39.331 --> 16:43.267
It's always stressful on some
level for an animal arriving

16:43.269 --> 16:46.304
<i>in a new facility, totally new
surroundings, new people.</i>

16:46.306 --> 16:49.140
<i>So, we will just
try to give her space.</i>

16:49.142 --> 16:51.175
<i>Let her settle in on her own.</i>

16:51.177 --> 16:54.946
<i>It is a 30 day quarantine
for her and so,</i>

16:54.948 --> 16:59.484
you know, slowly keepers will work
on building a relationship with her.

17:00.719 --> 17:02.320
I love seeing her using that.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.622
[Sara] Hi, sweet princess!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.393
[Lauren] This is an artificial
sloth tree.

17:09.294 --> 17:10.895
It's just about done.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.330
She's like, all right,
I like this.

17:12.831 --> 17:14.332
[Kathleen] You got it, girl.

17:16.168 --> 17:20.071
Come on out buddy. There you
go. Come on, come over here.

17:20.073 --> 17:23.508
[Kathleen] The first thing I always
look for, someone that needs a home.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.176
- Good morning!
- Hi! How are you?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.978
We got a friend for ya.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.228
We're gonna go get Calisto,
our two toed sloth.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.368
Good girl.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.837
Calisto enjoys
going to the classroom,

17:52.839 --> 17:55.606
she actually likes being held
like this too. [laughs]

17:56.475 --> 17:58.376
Today we have our sloth
encounter

17:58.378 --> 18:00.344
and we'll be featuring Calisto.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.113
- [gasps]
- [laughter]

18:03.882 --> 18:07.118
She's so nice that, if you guys
want to come up you can pet her.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.886
Our sloth encounters,

18:08.888 --> 18:11.289
they're one of the most
popular encounters we have.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.758
So you're gonna pet her
right on her back.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.527
- Oh my gosh!
- [gasp]

18:16.529 --> 18:19.163
<i>[Kathleen] We've always shown
a sloth on a coat rack.</i>

18:19.165 --> 18:22.366
<i>We would roll it around
outside if we did encounters,</i>

18:22.368 --> 18:24.335
<i>or in the classrooms
that we've used.</i>

18:24.337 --> 18:26.437
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem!

18:26.439 --> 18:30.341
So we started thinking about something
prettier, more naturalistic looking.

18:30.343 --> 18:34.445
<i>We sent Lauren some pictures
of sloths in the wild.</i>

18:34.447 --> 18:37.148
<i>And she came up
with this wonderful design.</i>

18:37.150 --> 18:40.284
<i>It's a beautiful tree
for our sloth.</i>

18:40.286 --> 18:44.388
[Lauren] This is an artificial
sloth tree for the TAB building.

18:44.390 --> 18:48.326
I did take impressions of an
actual tree to create a pad,

18:48.328 --> 18:51.496
to replicate
the texture of bark.

18:51.498 --> 18:56.367
It's just about done, I'm just
testing out fitting it on the base.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.402
And then it's ready
to be delivered.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.006
I'm pretty proud of this piece.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.942
I love sloths and I think
that kids and adults

19:04.944 --> 19:09.413
will really enjoy interacting
with a sloth on this tree.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.919
[Kira] All right, so which one are
we thinking? This one right here?

19:14.921 --> 19:16.420
Go with your gut,
wherever you think.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.690
-I feel this one. What're you feelin' Calisto?
-That's what we'd do.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.225
She's like,
all right, I like this.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.461
[Kathleen] You got it, girl.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.398
I mean think about it, in the wild
they have to do this you know?

19:27.400 --> 19:30.168
Test a branch,
can it support their weight?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.302
I'm still
a little nervous just--

19:31.304 --> 19:33.538
- Right, you wanna just...
- [laughter]

19:33.540 --> 19:38.242
[Lauren] It's probably like the first time
you see your kid on a bike or something.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.244
[laughter]

19:40.246 --> 19:43.214
[Lauren] Everything that was
put into this tree absolutely paid off.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.049
You know,
this is the rewarding part.

19:45.051 --> 19:50.188
To actually be able to create
something to make their lives better.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.123
[Kathleen] Each time we
have her out here

19:52.125 --> 19:54.425
her comfort level
is going to increase.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.261
One day she's gonna be
asleep right here.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.530
And that's gonna be really nice.

20:04.503 --> 20:08.439
- Look at, up there!
- Oh my gosh! Whoa!

20:12.311 --> 20:14.078
Sorry buddy.

20:16.181 --> 20:19.016
We're here in the
tree kangaroo exhibit,

20:19.018 --> 20:22.486
I'm just going to pick up any
old food and set out fresh food.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.558
All right.
So the exhibit is all ready.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.293
We just need a kangaroo.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.402
Go ahead buddy!

20:38.404 --> 20:40.705
There you go. Good job.

20:51.984 --> 20:56.053
I'm just grabbing some of the
greens that are in Polly's diet.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.923
Her diet's a little different
than what we feed Artemis.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.158
You can imagine
California, New York,

21:01.160 --> 21:03.094
have quite different
plant species growing.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.163
So what I have here is
a little bit of banana leaf

21:06.165 --> 21:09.934
and some... a couple different
kinds of honeysuckle brows.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.703
And we have her diet
all set by her holding,

21:12.705 --> 21:15.106
so we'll go down
and give her, her breakfast.

21:18.076 --> 21:21.279
Polly has been here
for just over two weeks.

21:21.281 --> 21:25.016
Today, I'll be hand feeding
Polly, doing a little socializing.

21:25.018 --> 21:29.020
Hand feeding Polly is something we
do just to build a bond with the animals

21:29.022 --> 21:33.324
<i>before we do any training. Make sure
that they'll actually take food from us.</i>

21:33.326 --> 21:37.561
You know, a sign of trust from them
that they'll accept their diet from you.

21:37.563 --> 21:40.398
And that they are comfortable
with you being that close to them.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.268
Hi, sweet princess.

21:46.204 --> 21:52.443
She has started taking things like greens
and leaves, carrots have been a big hit.

21:52.445 --> 21:57.048
With Polly specifically, I've been
able to speak with some of her keepers

21:57.050 --> 22:01.519
<i>from San Diego for things like
her diet, her behavior,</i>

22:01.521 --> 22:04.455
things that she likes to do
for enrichment.

22:04.457 --> 22:07.625
<i>You're never quite sure what
that animal's gonna prefer.</i>

22:07.627 --> 22:10.161
I'm with you girl.
I love green beans.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.933
So pretty much every morning I've been
spending 15 minutes or so in here with her.

22:15.935 --> 22:19.036
Kinda handing her
different food items.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.106
This is not something that we would've
been able to do a couple weeks ago.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.141
So, she's making improvements.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.246
<i>She still has another
two weeks in quarantine.</i>

22:29.248 --> 22:33.818
And once she finishes that up,
and everything's clear for her

22:33.820 --> 22:36.987
<i>she'll start introductions
with our male, Artemis.</i>

22:38.023 --> 22:40.124
Good news,
I found another green bean.

22:41.259 --> 22:44.295
- Jackpot, I know!
- [crunching]

22:49.835 --> 22:52.036
Whoa! See the little babies?

22:55.774 --> 22:57.842
[Jim] I'm headed over
to the World of Birds

22:57.844 --> 23:04.081
because there's an African spoonbill
chick that the keepers are raising.

23:04.083 --> 23:08.119
It might be a good candidate
to join Kathleen's program

23:08.121 --> 23:10.221
because it's pretty imprinted
on people.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.792
- Hi guys.
- Hey, Sir, how are you?

23:14.794 --> 23:17.061
- Good. How are you?
- We're good. We're very good.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.897
- Did you go in yet?
- No we wanted to wait for you.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.133
- Hey, thanks.
- Now, I'm excited, what's his name again?

23:22.135 --> 23:25.302
- His name is Sterling.
- We used to have a cat named sterling.

23:25.304 --> 23:26.570
[laughter]

23:27.472 --> 23:30.074
- [whistling]
- Oh!

23:30.375 --> 23:32.343
[Francis] Hi baby!

23:32.345 --> 23:36.280
The first thing I always look
for, for an animal for our program,

23:36.282 --> 23:37.248
is someone that needs a home.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.582
Hi, handsome.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.252
<i>Most of the animals at the
attractable animal building</i>

23:41.254 --> 23:44.321
<i>came to us pretty opportunistically.
We didn't seek them out.</i>

23:44.323 --> 23:45.823
<i>You know,
who was injured in the wild?</i>

23:45.825 --> 23:47.825
<i>Who didn't work out
in another program?</i>

23:47.827 --> 23:51.395
Sterling was raised
by the bird department.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.898
<i>And because of that,
he was imprinted on people,</i>

23:53.900 --> 23:55.733
<i>so he couldn't
go back to the flock.</i>

23:55.735 --> 24:00.004
So, we could give him a home, we
could educate the public about spoonbills.

24:00.006 --> 24:03.307
The ecology, their
environmental stresses they face.

24:03.309 --> 24:06.944
[Jim] Does he know he's a bird?
Or does he think he's a person?

24:06.946 --> 24:10.147
- I think that he thinks we're spoonbills.
- [laughter]

24:10.149 --> 24:13.451
He does a lot of those sort
of specific social behaviors,

24:13.453 --> 24:16.153
like, he'll preen, he'll flap
around, he'll play in a way

24:16.155 --> 24:17.922
that he would interact
with other birds.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.391
- [Jim] Does he come out or...
- [Francis] Oh, absolutely.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.026
- Go ahead and let him out.
- Yeah, sure.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.227
You want to come play, bud?

24:23.962 --> 24:25.229
Hey, buddy!

24:27.065 --> 24:30.501
- I love that noise!
- How are you, handsome?

24:32.070 --> 24:35.072
- Let's go down buddy. Hey bud!
- There you go.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.507
[Kathleen] How old
is he now, around?

24:36.509 --> 24:38.943
[Francis] He's a couple of
months, I want to say, four or five?

24:38.945 --> 24:40.544
- Oh, you're a youngster.
- Yeah.

24:41.179 --> 24:42.546
What're you doing my friend?

24:43.114 --> 24:44.515
That bill is so cool.

24:45.016 --> 24:48.719
Hello my love. Hi.

24:48.721 --> 24:52.790
[Jim] I think it's really important to
have birds like this in the program

24:52.792 --> 24:55.092
because a lot of people
that come to the zoo,

24:55.094 --> 24:58.095
don't necessarily
come to the zoo to see birds.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.831
Like this guy.
Who knows about a spoonbill?

25:00.833 --> 25:05.436
When you can present them with a
really cool bird that has a personality,

25:05.438 --> 25:07.671
it's a great way to get people
interested in birds.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.476
[laughter]

25:12.711 --> 25:15.346
- [Jim] You can see he's going to approach people.
- You're right.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.548
You're not can have an issue
with that.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.551
[Kathleen] And he's cool!
[laughs]

25:20.553 --> 25:24.955
<i>Sterling, I think, is going to be an
ambassador animal pretty quickly.</i>

25:24.957 --> 25:29.159
<i>So we'll see how he adapts and then
once he's used to his new surroundings,</i>

25:29.161 --> 25:31.495
his new home, we'll bring him
into the classroom.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.797
Nice to meet you!
[Laughs]

25:33.799 --> 25:35.332
[bird quacks]

25:35.334 --> 25:39.703
[Sara] We're excited that we can start
introducing her to our male, Artemis.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.706
Possibly love at first sight,
we'll see how it goes.

25:44.342 --> 25:45.342
Careful.

25:59.724 --> 26:00.991
Hey, honey.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.960
Ready?

26:02.962 --> 26:05.062
<i>Polly has been here at the zoo
for about a month.</i>

26:05.064 --> 26:08.098
<i>And she's finished
with quarantine.</i>

26:08.100 --> 26:13.037
So, we're excited that we can start
introducing her to our male, Artemis.

26:16.641 --> 26:19.877
You're the most handsome.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.347
<i>This'll be the first time Polly and
Artemis can actually see each other.</i>

26:23.349 --> 26:26.517
<i>If you put them together right
away, you could have an issue.</i>

26:26.519 --> 26:29.687
So we're gonna do intros between
what is called a 'howdy door.'

26:29.689 --> 26:32.890
<i>So it's just a mesh door so they
can see other, smell each other,</i>

26:32.892 --> 26:37.294
<i>interact a little bit, but not physically
contact each other too much.</i>

26:39.698 --> 26:42.666
Possibly love at first sight.
We'll see how it goes.

26:43.301 --> 26:44.468
Are you ready?

26:53.078 --> 26:54.445
She's kinda looking over.

26:55.213 --> 26:56.447
Hey, sweet flower.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.383
You don't even wanna know
what's over there?

27:01.219 --> 27:02.553
You gonna go down?

27:05.390 --> 27:07.358
He's a little more interested.

27:09.694 --> 27:13.397
<i>We might hear some vocalizing,
see some hair standing up.</i>

27:13.399 --> 27:16.133
But, I'm hoping we won't see
anything aggressive,

27:16.135 --> 27:18.068
or anything
that would be concerning.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.705
<i>Like, alarm calling
or start banging at the mesh.</i>

27:23.341 --> 27:24.942
Is he doing anything, Sara?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.647
[Sara] We've got movement.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.317
There you go.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.553
She's moving over there now.
She's at the door.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.156
And she's looking in.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.095
[Sara] He's being
ever so cautious.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.102
- Is that him or her?
- That's him.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.937
[Sara]
And she just started though.

27:54.939 --> 27:56.640
Who's that?

27:58.009 --> 28:00.711
<i>We've heard a little bit of
vocalizing, which is typical.</i>

28:00.713 --> 28:04.415
Nothing too crazy and that's
just totally normal.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.250
Just a hey, who are you?

28:11.389 --> 28:13.490
Yeah there you go.
Take a break.

28:15.994 --> 28:17.961
Want your carrots?

28:17.963 --> 28:21.298
- Even just her coming down and eating with everyone is...
- Yeah.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.067
[Sara] Big step for you honey.

28:25.603 --> 28:28.939
<i>We'll continue with the visual
introductions through the mesh.</i>

28:28.941 --> 28:33.043
Then we'll move forward with actually
putting the two animals together.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.279
[Jessica] This is so cute.

28:35.980 --> 28:39.283
We may have made
a love connection.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.122
- Look!
- [children chattering]

29:03.775 --> 29:05.175
[Ken] Hey goober.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.283
This is Sterling,
our African spoonbill.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.120
We kinda found him cold and
on the ground in the exhibit.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.155
And so for his safety in itself,

29:18.157 --> 29:21.525
we had to bring him to World
of Birds to be hand raised.

29:23.962 --> 29:25.229
Come on out, buddy.

29:27.165 --> 29:30.367
There you go. Come on.
Come over here.

29:30.369 --> 29:34.104
Today Sterling is gonna be going
over to the attractable animal building.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.306
Why don't you come up over here?

29:38.810 --> 29:40.177
I'll see if I can get him
to stand on the scale,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.179
so we can get
a nice body weight,

29:42.181 --> 29:46.350
that way when we move him, will know if
he's having some trouble if he loses weight.

29:52.157 --> 29:56.527
1.67 kg. That's a good weight.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.599
Hey, hey, hey, right in there.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.276
<i>He's an imprinted animal, so
he's a perfect education animal.</i>

30:13.745 --> 30:15.679
<i>He's not afraid
of people at all,</i>

30:15.681 --> 30:18.148
<i>so he's charismatic,
he's big and obvious,</i>

30:18.150 --> 30:21.118
<i>and he's got the really cool
adaptation with his nice, wide bill.</i>

30:21.120 --> 30:24.655
<i>So, an education setting is
really a perfect thing for him.</i>

30:30.695 --> 30:32.763
It's always
what were looking for, right?

30:32.765 --> 30:36.433
<i>It's always a win whenever we can
find the best situation for an animal.</i>

30:36.435 --> 30:39.036
<i>Whether that's on exhibit,
in another zoo,</i>

30:39.038 --> 30:41.705
<i>or in another
department's areas.</i>

30:41.707 --> 30:44.975
<i>I think a lot of the keepers are going to
miss Sterling when he moves on, you know?</i>

30:44.977 --> 30:47.778
<i>He such a friendly
and charismatic animal that,</i>

30:47.780 --> 30:50.080
<i>he's a fan favorite.
We'll put it that way.</i>

30:56.187 --> 30:57.855
- [Ken] Good morning.
- Hi, how are you?

30:57.857 --> 30:58.956
I'm good.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.524
We got a friend for ya.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.462
- So, he's already eaten this morning.
- Okay.

31:05.464 --> 31:10.300
- But I'm sure he'd eat again, whenever you feed him.
- Okay.

31:10.302 --> 31:14.304
- [bird calls]
- Hello.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.439
What do you think of the set up?

31:15.441 --> 31:17.107
[Ken] The running water is key.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.343
The clean water on the top
is what's gonna

31:19.345 --> 31:21.411
- keep his feathers good.
- Yeah.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.882
And then he'll get to go outside in
the nice weather, so that'll be nice.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.950
[Ken] Yeah, that'll be
really nice for him.

31:26.952 --> 31:30.320
We waited so long for Sterling
to come here. We're very happy.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.622
It's exciting.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.860
Hey, buddy. Check it out.
New digs.

31:36.862 --> 31:39.263
-There you go.
-[Kathleen] He's so good. Look at him.

31:40.331 --> 31:43.066
- Yeah, step up there.
- Hey, Sterle!

31:43.068 --> 31:46.303
Oh he's beautiful.
He got so much bigger!

31:46.938 --> 31:48.338
He looks amazing.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.141
He's curious, he's beautiful.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.310
As soon as Sterling settles in,

31:53.312 --> 31:56.113
when we see he's eating
consistently, his weight is steady

31:56.115 --> 31:58.415
<i>and he seems at ease
in his new environment,</i>

31:58.417 --> 32:00.984
<i>we're gonna introduce the
meet and greet room at TAB.</i>

32:00.986 --> 32:02.619
Yeah, you guys
are gonna love him.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.088
<i>[Kathleen] And that'll start
with just a couple of us.</i>

32:05.090 --> 32:08.358
And then we'll start bringing
new people that he doesn't know.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.862
<i>And then hopefully we'll get
him into a program pretty soon.</i>

32:11.864 --> 32:15.032
- Looks good. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.800
- We'll leave him settled for a little bit.
- Yeah.

32:16.802 --> 32:22.306
- Bye Sterle. Bye Ho.
- [bird calls]

32:22.308 --> 32:25.709
<i>[Micah] Creating a dynamic
exhibit is making it look like</i>

32:25.711 --> 32:28.111
<i>something that is plucked
from the wild.</i>

32:28.113 --> 32:31.515
<i>Once the snakes are in, that
should be really, just, you know,</i>

32:31.517 --> 32:33.116
<i>the ribbon on top.</i>

32:34.552 --> 32:35.986
[Sara] Come on good girl.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.756
Do you want all that?

32:40.058 --> 32:44.594
Polly Kangaroo, come on. You know
I'm serious when I use your full name.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.135
- Look!
- Wow!

32:58.343 --> 32:59.810
I think that looks pretty good.

32:59.812 --> 33:02.245
- Yeah, I think it came out really nice.
- [Don] Yeah.

33:02.247 --> 33:05.916
I love how the plants, they
blended that, as good as they could.

33:05.918 --> 33:07.451
Pool will be nice.

33:07.453 --> 33:10.153
In their habitat there's a lot of little
streams and stuff that go through it.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.855
So, that'll be good.

33:11.857 --> 33:15.258
<i>The Mang vipers came to us
from a confiscation</i>

33:15.260 --> 33:16.994
<i>the New York authorities
carried out.</i>

33:16.996 --> 33:22.933
And a lot of the animals in that
confiscation had a viral disease problem.

33:22.935 --> 33:26.870
<i>But others, we were able
to successfully clear.</i>

33:26.872 --> 33:30.007
<i>So it's gratifying that some of
those snakes emerge from that,</i>

33:30.009 --> 33:31.675
<i>and the Mang vipers
were among those.</i>

33:32.810 --> 33:36.747
I think one of the elements
of creating a dynamic exhibit,

33:36.749 --> 33:40.884
is making it look like something
that is kind of plucked from the wild.

33:40.886 --> 33:45.322
Once the snakes are in, that
should be really just, the ribbon on top.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.525
Okay. I'm gonna do
the male first.

33:55.967 --> 33:59.136
<i>When I started here
as a full time keeper,</i>

33:59.138 --> 34:03.340
<i>working with snakes was probably
the part that I was most nervous about.</i>

34:03.342 --> 34:07.144
<i>Especially working with large
snakes and venomous snakes.</i>

34:07.146 --> 34:10.013
Oh, she is heavier.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.488
<i>But over time, and as I
learned more about them,</i>

34:18.490 --> 34:21.224
<i>and as they gained skill
and experience,</i>

34:21.226 --> 34:23.660
it's probably
my favorite part of the job.

34:24.762 --> 34:26.963
Just really,
really beautiful snakes.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.808
<i>[Don] This is the first time
in ten years</i>

34:37.810 --> 34:40.677
<i>we've had Mang vipers
on exhibit at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

34:40.679 --> 34:42.212
It's great having them
out on exhibit

34:42.214 --> 34:45.482
and seeing them
do some natural behaviors.

34:46.918 --> 34:51.154
The beauty and diversity of reptiles
and amphibians around the globe,

34:51.156 --> 34:53.990
is something that people
should appreciate.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.159
And if they don't ever
get to see these things,

34:56.161 --> 34:58.228
they may not have
that appreciation.

35:01.199 --> 35:04.701
<i>I see these animals almost on
a daily basis when I'm working.</i>

35:04.703 --> 35:07.804
<i>They're not a species you
would normally see every day.</i>

35:07.806 --> 35:12.442
So, I feel really fortunate that I get to
work with them and interact with them.

35:24.555 --> 35:27.324
- Look at the monkeys!
- Do you see the monkeys?

35:31.395 --> 35:33.096
What do you think Polly?

35:34.332 --> 35:36.867
[Sara] You guys ready?

35:36.869 --> 35:41.071
<i>So today we're gonna be putting
Polly in with Artemis for the first time.</i>

35:41.073 --> 35:44.040
Having a full introduction,
no barriers between them.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.176
[laughter]

35:47.945 --> 35:49.579
[Jessica] He's gonna go out.
Look at him.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.585
Polly, you might wanna
turn around.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.288
Here he comes.

36:01.392 --> 36:02.993
[Sara] Gonna go see him?

36:02.995 --> 36:05.395
- Oh, I did not expect that.
- I know.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.497
Wow.

36:07.499 --> 36:10.967
<i>[Sara] Surprisingly, Polly was
the one to initiate the contact at first.</i>

36:10.969 --> 36:14.604
Artemis was a little
distracted by other things.

36:14.606 --> 36:18.141
[Sarah] Not too persistent, I
mean, he's definitely interested.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.143
[laughter]

36:22.513 --> 36:24.281
[Sarah] He's just gonna
hold her tail. [laughs]

36:24.283 --> 36:27.217
- What are you gonna do with that?
- [laughter]

36:27.219 --> 36:30.320
- [Jessica] It's a very gentle kind of swatting.
- [Sara] I know, right?

36:30.322 --> 36:33.156
It's like, just go that way.

36:34.892 --> 36:38.261
<i>The swatting definitely is a,
"I don't want you doing that."</i>

36:38.263 --> 36:44.935
And just give them a warning. So,
what we're seeing is very mild aggression.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.971
[Sarah] He's being good. I mean,
you want him to be interested.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.839
- So...
- [Sara] Right.

36:49.841 --> 36:53.476
[Jessica] So, I think they're just kinda
trying to figure each other out right now.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.845
So, were just gonna err
on the side of caution,

36:55.847 --> 36:57.547
since this is the first
introduction.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.450
And split them
when we have the opportunity.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.953
[Sara] Come here, Polly!

37:04.121 --> 37:07.624
Want to shift over?
And she's in.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.060
There, you can have that.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.028
[Sarah] That was exciting!

37:12.030 --> 37:15.565
- I don't think breeding will be too difficult.
- Yeah, apparently.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.568
[Sarah] When she is receptive,
we should be golden, yeah.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.106
Head on out bub.

37:31.015 --> 37:33.316
- [woman] Oh, there she goes!
- [Sarah] Good girl.

37:37.154 --> 37:41.992
Polly's inspecting the perch
and the nesting area.

37:43.828 --> 37:46.096
Kinda smelling everything,
checking it out.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.465
I'm sure it smells
like our male, Artemis.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.837
[Jessica]
Finding her high spot.

37:53.839 --> 37:57.307
<i>Having Polly here, at the
Bronx Zoo, is exciting for us</i>

37:57.309 --> 38:02.946
<i>because it allows us to be a part of
the collective effort in helping to sustain</i>

38:02.948 --> 38:05.248
<i>the Matschie's
tree-kangaroo population.</i>

38:05.250 --> 38:06.983
[chuckle] She's cute.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.019
<i>Which is very important,</i>

38:09.021 --> 38:14.424
because the wild population is
threatened by primarily habitat loss.

38:14.426 --> 38:19.663
<i>And so as that population
faces these ongoing threats,</i>

38:19.665 --> 38:21.298
<i>and the possibility
of extinction,</i>

38:21.300 --> 38:24.067
<i>it is really important that
everybody combine their efforts</i>

38:24.069 --> 38:28.104
to try to save this species,
in zoos.

38:28.106 --> 38:32.008
-[Sara] Careful.
-[Jessica] She's cute. No doubt about that.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.513
[Kathleen] We don't like to
spring anything new on an animal.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.515
Sterle! Hey, Buddy!

38:40.184 --> 38:41.484
[Jim] What are you doing?

38:41.486 --> 38:44.220
[Kira] With his feathers
this color, you guys match.

38:44.222 --> 38:45.288
[laughter]

38:55.333 --> 38:56.666
[Kira] Hey, handsome.

38:57.702 --> 39:00.270
Do you wanna go in the
classroom? Come here buddy.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.272
Okay, you ready? Let's go.

39:03.774 --> 39:06.242
Watch your head, bud.
Go on in, good job.

39:07.912 --> 39:10.013
<i>We're gonna bring Sterling
into the classroom</i>

39:10.015 --> 39:13.283
to start acclimating
him to doing encounters.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.318
You ready buddy?

39:19.590 --> 39:20.523
[Kathleen] Sterle!

39:22.393 --> 39:23.760
Okay.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.363
<i>[Kathleen] We don't like to
spring anything new on an animal.</i>

39:26.365 --> 39:28.698
<i>We like them to get used to it
at their pace.</i>

39:28.700 --> 39:30.900
<i>What we're gonna look for
today is,</i>

39:30.902 --> 39:34.270
you know, is he confident, is he
exploring? Does he look at ease?

39:35.072 --> 39:37.040
Just, making sure
he's comfortable.

39:39.276 --> 39:41.077
Hey buddy.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.179
- [Jim] Look at that.
- Oh! There he goes!

39:43.181 --> 39:46.049
- [laughter]
- [Jim] What're you doing?

39:46.051 --> 39:48.118
[Kira] I love that.
I think that's...

39:48.819 --> 39:51.788
- Hi!
- [laughter]

39:51.790 --> 39:55.458
[man] He's so trusting though, I mean, it's
a relatively new environment, you know?

39:55.460 --> 39:58.461
I mean, even us, we're all
relatively new to him,

39:58.463 --> 40:01.331
and he still very comfortable
with us, which I like.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.968
<i>[Kathleen] He's exploring,
he's investigating.</i>

40:04.970 --> 40:07.036
<i>When you see him
with his bill down,</i>

40:07.038 --> 40:08.972
that's how
they would forage in the wild,

40:08.974 --> 40:10.540
they would search for food.

40:11.976 --> 40:15.145
[Jim] They have a lot of
sensory receptors in their beaks,

40:15.147 --> 40:17.247
so when they're going
like this in shallow water,

40:17.249 --> 40:18.948
they can feel for things to eat.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.384
So I mean, he doesn't have
hands like we do.

40:21.386 --> 40:23.987
So, he uses that beak
to feel around.

40:24.889 --> 40:27.090
He's a neat bird.

40:27.092 --> 40:31.828
- I don't think he would mind larger groups of people.
- [Kathleen] No.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.364
[man] This is probably the most
he's experienced in one setting,

40:34.366 --> 40:35.765
and he's doing pretty well.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.000
Think this'll be a big hit.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.335
[Kathleen] So, when
do you think public programs?

40:39.337 --> 40:42.038
I think he's certainly ready.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.942
[Kira] With his feathers
this color, you guys match.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.145
[laughter]

40:49.147 --> 40:52.715
<i>[Jim] I think the people that come for
the encounters will really like Sterling.</i>

40:52.717 --> 40:56.352
<i>Mainly for the reason that
they'll be in a space with a bird</i>

40:56.354 --> 40:59.055
that will be curious about them

40:59.057 --> 41:02.158
and choose to interact
with them and engage them.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.693
He wants to see what's up.

41:03.928 --> 41:06.696
<i>I think a lot of times you go
near the bird, the bird flies away.</i>

41:06.698 --> 41:09.065
<i>But when you're
in a situation like this,</i>

41:09.067 --> 41:11.267
it's a totally
different experience.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.870
- What are you doing?
- [Kathleen] He's curious about it.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.806
Sterling's story
started off a little sad.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.309
Come on Bud.
Come on Sterling.

41:19.311 --> 41:22.712
But the best end for any of our
animals is just for them to be happy.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.914
[man] Nice job.

41:25.115 --> 41:29.118
[Kathleen] Sterling is happy. He identifies
with people, and we are happy with him.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.887
So, it's a very good end to
the story.

41:30.889 --> 41:33.323
And we get to share his story
with visitors.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.724
[Kira] You did so good!

41:36.393 --> 41:37.660
Who's a good boy?
