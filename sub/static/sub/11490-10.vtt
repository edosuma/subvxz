WEBVTT

00:04.530 --> 00:05.760
Jake.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.600
You're hardly touching your salad.

00:07.660 --> 00:10.700
I promised Berta I'd cut 
down on the roughage.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.930
Well, all right.

00:18.000 --> 00:18.960
Why don't I get the soup.

00:20.930 --> 00:24.030
Based on the salad, 
I'm not so optimistic.

00:24.100 --> 00:27.600
So you have absolutely no idea 
why she invited us here?

00:27.660 --> 00:28.860
All she said on the phone was "dinner."

00:28.930 --> 00:30.530
<i>And you believed her?</i>

00:31.630 --> 00:32.800
Good God, man,

00:32.860 --> 00:34.260
do you realize what you've done?

00:34.330 --> 00:36.030
Just relax.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.130
"Just relax"?

00:37.200 --> 00:38.680
We'll be lucky to leave here

00:38.680 --> 00:40.990
with all of our limbs and gonads.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.260
What's a gonad?

00:43.330 --> 00:44.630
You are.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.930
So it's bad.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.200
You're not a gonad.

00:50.260 --> 00:52.430
Says the other gonad.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.630
Here we go.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.000
Potato leek soup.

00:58.060 --> 00:59.960
Oh, delightful.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.030
You got any crackers?

01:03.100 --> 01:04.430
"Crackers"?

01:04.459 --> 01:06.530
Yeah, I like something crunchy in my soup.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.830
A little goldfish, crouton, a stale bagel...

01:08.900 --> 01:10.830
I'll check.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.900
Go ahead and start.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.300
Captain Crunch will work in a pinch.

01:15.860 --> 01:18.660
I've got a bad feeling about this, Alan.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.730
What? We're having a nice 
dinner with our mother.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.400
So you feel it, too?

01:23.860 --> 01:27.330
What kind of person doesn't serve 
crackers with soup?

01:27.400 --> 01:31.000
The only thing I have that's 
crunchy is macadamia nuts.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.630
Interesting. Let's give 'er a try.

01:37.100 --> 01:39.730
Well, I suppose you boys are wondering

01:39.800 --> 01:41.100
why I asked you here.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.430
You mean this isn't just a nice, 
warm family dinner?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.400
Knock it off, Charlie.

01:47.630 --> 01:49.130
I have some good news.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.930
And no, I'm not dying.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.900
I didn't say anything.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.660
Why would you even go there?

01:56.030 --> 01:57.730
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:57.800 --> 02:02.100
Anyway, I have been doing some financial planning.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.900
So you're thinking about dying?

02:03.960 --> 02:08.030
Trust me, darling, I promise to stick 
around long enough

02:08.100 --> 02:12.500
to identify your bloated, gin-soaked, syphilitic remains.

02:16.530 --> 02:18.130
Okay, so we've got a time frame.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.700
So what about your financial plan?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.100
Yes, well, one thing I've done

02:25.160 --> 02:27.860
is to set aside enough money to ensure

02:27.930 --> 02:30.730
that my grandson will get a 
college education.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.700
You're gonna buy a college?

02:40.760 --> 02:43.330
I have set up a trust fund.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.230
Oh, Mom, Mom, that is, uh,

02:45.300 --> 02:47.030
that is very generous, but, uh, I actually

02:47.100 --> 02:49.000
started a college fund for Jake 
when he was born.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.430
Really?

02:52.060 --> 02:53.600
How much you have in there now?

02:57.560 --> 02:59.730
Did you hear? Grandma's seing 
you to college.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.360
Now? I haven't finished my soup.

03:05.730 --> 03:07.760
Mom, have you thought this through?

03:07.830 --> 03:08.860
Look at him.

03:10.630 --> 03:14.500
<i>Maybe there should be one child left behind.</i>

03:16.460 --> 03:18.830
Charlie, Charlie, shush.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.460
Mom, I-I cannot tell you

03:20.530 --> 03:21.830
how much I appreciate this.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.900
Jake, do you understand

03:23.960 --> 03:25.460
what your grandma is providing here?

03:25.530 --> 03:26.660
Yeah, more school.

03:26.730 --> 03:27.800
Big whoop.

03:27.860 --> 03:30.430
Well, Jal help enthuse you.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.960
If you buckle down and your grades improve,

03:33.030 --> 03:35.030
when the time comes for you to go to college,

03:35.100 --> 03:37.460
Grandmommy is going to buy you a new car.

03:37.530 --> 03:39.530
I love you, Grandmommy!

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.460 --> 04:14.260
By the way, when I get my car from Grandma,

04:14.330 --> 04:17.329
one of you guys is gonna have to park 
on the street.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.430
The car is for college.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.760
And what makes you think 
you'll still be living here?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.900
Oh, comen, you know you love me.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.860
He's got you there. You do love him.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.160
Yeah, but he doesn't have to rub 
my nose in it.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.460
So what do you think Mom's angle is?

04:35.530 --> 04:37.760
Does she have to have an angle?

04:37.830 --> 04:38.960
A college trust fund?

04:39.030 --> 04:40.160
For him?

04:41.070 --> 04:43.750
Last week he bit his hand eating a sandwich.

04:44.230 --> 04:46.300
He smelled the ham.and He got excited.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.860
Maybe she's just trying to buy his love.

04:49.930 --> 04:52.000
Alan, think it through.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.630
She could've done that with a pork chop

04:53.700 --> 04:55.460
and a Creamsicle.

04:55.530 --> 04:58.330
Well, whatever it is, it is a big load 
off my mind

04:58.400 --> 04:59.830
knowing his education's taken care of.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.960
Oh, yeah, that's what Mom wants,

05:02.030 --> 05:04.030
to take a load off your mind.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.130
Okay, why do you think she did it?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.800
I don't know.

05:07.860 --> 05:09.660
But if you want to get inside her head,

05:09.730 --> 05:11.230
you've got to start thinking more twisted,

05:11.300 --> 05:14.030
manipulative, devious.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.700
For example,

05:15.760 --> 05:18.460
if by some miracle he gets through college

05:18.530 --> 05:19.760
and she sends him to law school...

05:19.830 --> 05:22.530
L-law school? You've already lost me.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.430
Maybe she's boinking the dean of admissions.

05:24.500 --> 05:25.700
We don't know. Just hear me out.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.700
Go on.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.760
Let's say he crawls through law school,

05:29.830 --> 05:31.830
takes seven or eight shots at passing the bar.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.000
We know how that ends.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.830
So what are his options as a failed lawyer?

05:36.900 --> 05:39.000
I don't know. Government work?

05:39.060 --> 05:40.500
Exactly.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.330
Maybe he lands on the zoning commission.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.560
And bingo-bango, Mom finally gets

05:44.630 --> 05:46.100
to put a second story on her house.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.060
You really think she's going to send him to college

05:53.130 --> 05:56.630
<i>and law school just so she can add an extra bedroom?</i>

05:56.700 --> 05:57.860
That's insane.

05:57.930 --> 05:59.460
Is it, Alan?

06:01.300 --> 06:03.600
Is it really?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.130
Morning.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.860
Morning.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.460
Alan?

06:20.530 --> 06:22.030
Yeah?

06:22.100 --> 06:24.100
You having a stroke?

06:26.060 --> 06:27.400
No, no, I'm just,

06:27.460 --> 06:28.930
??????
I'm just trying to figure out

06:29.000 --> 06:30.830
<i>why I need to go to work today.</i>

06:30.900 --> 06:32.030
I mean,

06:32.100 --> 06:34.850
Mom's taking care of Jake's education,

06:34.850 --> 06:36.230
buying him a car.

06:36.510 --> 06:37.910
Why should I bust my hump?

06:38.460 --> 06:41.060
For your self-respect?

06:41.130 --> 06:43.300
Nah, Judith got that in the divorce.

06:44.630 --> 06:47.300
'Cause you like to heal people's back pain

06:47.360 --> 06:48.830
with your chiropractic magic?

06:52.130 --> 06:54.700
Okay, well, you've got to go somewhere.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.730
Why?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.730
'Cause you're creeping me out.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.660
I should take up motivational speaking.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.760
Morning.

07:07.830 --> 07:09.060
Something's wrong with your brother.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.630
We don't say the word "wrong."

07:10.700 --> 07:12.100
We say "special."

07:13.900 --> 07:15.930
No, it's true. My friends don't think 
you're my grandma.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.730
They think you're my young aunt.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.030
If he gets his nose any further up 
her keister,

07:24.100 --> 07:26.060
we're gonna have to tie a rope to his feet.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.330
Hey, I was thinking.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.730
You know what would be a nice, safe vehicle 
for me?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
A used police car.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.860
I don't know. I guess from the police?

07:39.930 --> 07:42.360
She's buying Lunkhead a car?

07:42.430 --> 07:45.230
And a college education. Ha.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.630
Well, I guess that makes sense

07:46.700 --> 07:49.100
if it's a clown college and the car seats 20.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.460
All right, then'll see you in an hour.

07:54.530 --> 07:55.800
Hold on.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.060
Nah, I don't need one.

07:58.930 --> 08:00.660
Okay, okay, bye.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.600
I'm gonna spend the afternoon with Grandma.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.800
If she asks, I took a shower.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.030
Figured out her angle yet?

08:08.100 --> 08:12.000
No. And that's what scares me.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.660
Seemed appropriate

08:21.230 --> 08:23.260
All right, Mr. Sharipa.

08:23.330 --> 08:24.560
How's it feel right here?

08:24.630 --> 08:26.100
A little tender.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.300
Yeah, yeah, you've got a spasm right here.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.600
It's my own fault.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.400
I was trying to do it in the shower

08:32.460 --> 08:34.360
with Mrs. Sharipa last night.

08:34.429 --> 08:38.059
The woman is no ballerina.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.429
Well, sex in the showe is really 
a young man's game.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.230
Or a middle-aged man with a skinny wife.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.230
Sure.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.900
What can I say?

08:48.960 --> 08:51.930
I like a little junk in the trunk.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.300
I, I think that says it.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.300
Slap her on the ass at Christmas,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.930
it doesn't stop shaking till New Year's Eve.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.760
Just between you and me,

09:03.830 --> 09:08.160
she enjoys a little spanking from Santa.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.030
Who doesn't?

09:10.100 --> 09:12.360
I check the list twice:

09:12.430 --> 09:14.100
always naughty.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.730
Uh-huh. Could you, uh,

09:19.800 --> 09:21.030
turn on your right, Mr. Sharipa.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.330
I'll, uh, try to relieve

09:22.400 --> 09:24.230
the pressure on your sciatic nerve.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.400
Would you cross your arms, please?

09:25.460 --> 09:26.400
Uh-huh. Thank you.

09:26.460 --> 09:27.730
Okay.

09:33.130 --> 09:35.160
Excuse me.

09:36.830 --> 09:38.760
Oh, no, that, uh, that happens.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.830
It's, uh, it's perfectly natural...

09:43.260 --> 09:45.600
Oh, dear Lord.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.460
Yeah, that's the garlic clams I had folunch.

09:49.530 --> 09:52.700
I like them. They don't like me.

09:54.130 --> 09:57.600
Um, if you'll just excuse me for a moment.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.060
Hey, you know, I feel better.

10:01.130 --> 10:05.080
Maybe that's where the pressure came from.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.150
Where are you gog, Dr. Harper?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.040
Home.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.070
Will you be coming back?

10:11.830 --> 10:14.160
Dr. Harper?

10:18.590 --> 10:19.680
Oh, my God.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.600
Let's spend a little time

10:26.660 --> 10:28.400
talking about our college plans.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.700
"Our plans"?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.760
Are you going, too? 'Cause that changes everything.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.500
I've already been to college, darling.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.530
And they were some of the happiest 
years of my life.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.260
Really? Mm-hmm.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.760
What kind of car did you have?

10:41.830 --> 10:44.560
Look, Jake, I understand that you're excited

10:44.630 --> 10:47.260
about getting a car, but keep in mind

10:47.330 --> 10:50.500
the car is predicated on you getting into college.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.030
Right.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.460
What's "predicated" mean?

10:54.530 --> 10:57.260
No college, no car.

10:57.330 --> 10:59.530
Oh.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.630
What if I flunk out?

11:00.700 --> 11:01.800
Do I have to give the car back?

11:01.860 --> 11:03.060
Oh, sweetheart,

11:03.130 --> 11:04.830
what makes you think you'd flunk out?

11:04.900 --> 11:06.330
Well, history.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.000
Right now there's a 60/60 chance

11:08.060 --> 11:10.260
I'm gonna have to repeat eighth grade.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.680
60/60, huh?

11:13.750 --> 11:15.110
At least.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.150
It could be 70/40.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.180
Well, we can rule out the Ivy League.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.180
?Is that good?

11:21.250 --> 11:22.780
For the Ivy League.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.750
You know, dear,

11:24.810 --> 11:27.680
maybe we're going about this the wrong way.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.510
College should be about pursuing 
the things you love.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.210
What do you love?

11:32.280 --> 11:35.510
Um, TV, video games, sleeping.

11:35.580 --> 11:36.680
I love sleeping so much

11:36.750 --> 11:38.480
sometimes I actually dream about it.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.780
Okay, maybe I wasn't clear enough.

11:42.850 --> 11:44.550
Oh, you know what I really love?

11:44.610 --> 11:45.710
Twice-dipped French toast

11:45.780 --> 11:47.380
with a sprinkling of orange zest.

11:47.450 --> 11:48.710
Orange zest?

11:48.780 --> 11:50.450
Yeah, you scrape it from an orange peel.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.450
It's what really makes my recipe work.

11:52.510 --> 11:53.950
You have a recipe?

11:54.010 --> 11:54.950
Yep.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.180
It kinda happened by accident.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.780
I was making once-dipped opped it.

11:57.780 --> 11:58.980
but i drop it

11:59.010 --> 12:00.680
A lot of great discoveries are accidents

12:00.750 --> 12:02.610
like Thomas Edison and the telephone.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.310
That wasn't Thomas...

12:05.880 --> 12:08.280
So you like to cook?

12:09.150 --> 12:10.150
Yeah, I love it.

12:10.210 --> 12:11.150
'Cause, you know, I love to eat

12:11.210 --> 12:12.610
and I lo.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.450
Well, you know, dear,

12:15.510 --> 12:18.780
what you are talking about is 
becoming a chef,

12:18.850 --> 12:20.780
and there are schools for that,

12:20.850 --> 12:23.450
and-and the potential to make a terrific living.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.750
Do I get to wear one of those poofy hats?

12:25.810 --> 12:27.110
If you want to.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.410
Cool. Then I guess I'll be a chef.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.380
My grandson the chef.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.950
I can live with that.

12:35.010 --> 12:37.210
You know what I could drive if I was a chef?

12:37.280 --> 12:39.510
The Oscar Mayer Weinermobile.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.580
I got a kayak.

12:58.650 --> 13:00.850
I see.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.650
Guess what I'm gonna do?

13:02.710 --> 13:04.650
Go kayaking?

13:04.710 --> 13:05.850
Yep.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.380
I have decided that life is too short.

13:08.450 --> 13:11.380
So you're going out in the Pacific Ocean 
in a plastic boat.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.080
Good thinking.

13:13.150 --> 13:14.910
No, I was at work today

13:14.980 --> 13:17.880
and it suddenly became clear to me that...

13:17.950 --> 13:20.850
Sorry about that.

13:20.910 --> 13:21.980
It became clear to me

13:22.050 --> 13:23.110
that I don't like what I'm doing.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.810
And nong care of Jake,

13:24.880 --> 13:27.310
I can spend my time doing the things 
that give me joy.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.410
So you're gonna masturbate in a kayak?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.080
No, but that's the point.

13:33.150 --> 13:35.950
You'll have to elaborate.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.050
I could if I wanted to.

13:44.480 --> 13:49.180
Yeah, who could've seen that coming?

13:49.250 --> 13:50.280
Look, I'm sorry.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.480
Here you go.

13:57.550 --> 14:00.110
Grilled cheese with gouda, Swiss and monster.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.150
You mean meunster.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.780
No, that's an old TV show.

14:03.850 --> 14:05.550
And they're called that 'cause they're monsters.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.180
This is a cheese.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.810
Anyway, the sandwich also has heirloom 
tomatoes

14:09.880 --> 14:12.350
and smoked applewood bacon on 
sourdough toast.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.110
Where did you learn this?

14:14.180 --> 14:16.410
Food Channel and FoodChannel.com.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.750
Food Channel on Demand, Food Channel magazine.

14:18.810 --> 14:21.750
And the school lunch lady.

14:21.810 --> 14:24.450
Nd save room for homemade potato chips.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.280
You're making potato chips?

14:27.350 --> 14:28.350
Oh, yeah, it's easy.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.410
You slice the potatoes real thin,

14:29.480 --> 14:30.950
rub the sides with lemon and garlic,

14:31.010 --> 14:32.580
fry 'em up in a hot iron skillet

14:32.650 --> 14:34.250
and then salt to taste.

14:34.310 --> 14:36.480
I can't get over this.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.310
Bon appetite.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.550
Teet.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.550
(bon appetite  appeteet tite)

14:39.610 --> 14:42.160
No, that's a cow's boob.

14:39.610 --> 14:42.160
(teet teat)

14:43.880 --> 14:46.450
Oh, my goodness.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.480
This is delicious.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.180
Don't eat more than three or 
you won't poop for a week.

14:53.210 --> 14:55.350
Trust me.

14:55.410 --> 14:57.850
Well, at least

14:57.910 --> 15:00.480
we have finally found a career path for you.

15:00.550 --> 15:02.910
Cool. I'll go get the chips 
and then we'll talk about cars.

15:04.950 --> 15:05.980
You know what?

15:06.050 --> 15:07.610
Let's settle this car thing first.

15:15.380 --> 15:18.280
Oh, God, it was incredible.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.310
The-the wind, the sky,

15:20.380 --> 15:21.980
the surf.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.010
I feel like I'm reborn.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.480
You were out there for 15 minutes.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.810
Yeah, well, my arms got tired.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.350
so you did decide to go with the kayanking.

15:37.410 --> 15:39.150
What?

15:39.210 --> 15:41.210
Masturyaking?

15:41.280 --> 15:43.280
You're terrible.

15:43.350 --> 15:45.310
But, anyway, no one could see me.

15:49.850 --> 15:50.950
}So now what?

15:51.010 --> 15:52.180
Now?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.510
Now I just live.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.010
I enjoy.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.750
All right.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.180
This rat has quit the race.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.510
Good for you.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.510
This hamster is off the treadmill.

16:02.580 --> 16:04.180
Glad to hear it.

16:04.250 --> 16:08.150
This squirrel is satisfied with the nuts he has.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.310
No comment.

16:15.910 --> 16:18.880
I'm not gonna make it, Charlie.

16:18.950 --> 16:20.610
Didn't think you would.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.010
No goals, no challenges,

16:23.080 --> 16:26.180
no, no gutrenching fear driving me forward.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.580
I mean, how can you stand it?

16:28.650 --> 16:30.350
Me?

16:30.410 --> 16:32.910
Well, I have kind of an existential 
philosophy

16:32.980 --> 16:35.080
that shapes my outlook.

16:35.150 --> 16:36.780
It involves a willingness

16:36.850 --> 16:39.280
to let life carry me along in its wake

16:39.350 --> 16:41.580
as I contemplate its infinite mystery.

16:43.550 --> 16:46.580
Plus I drink and take a lot of naps.

16:46.650 --> 16:50.350
Nwell, I need something meaningful 
to strive for.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.780
Sorry, I don't follow.

16:53.850 --> 16:56.950
I need a carrot in front of me and a stick behind me.

16:57.010 --> 17:00.950
Without that, I... I have no reason to live.

17:01.950 --> 17:04.210
That's it!

17:04.280 --> 17:05.410
What's it?

17:05.480 --> 17:07.810
"No reason to live."

17:07.880 --> 17:09.780
That's Mom's angle.

17:09.849 --> 17:11.750
This never had anything to do with Jake.

17:11.810 --> 17:13.950
}She's trying to kill you.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.349
Oh, come on.

17:17.410 --> 17:19.180
Think about it.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.010
She takes the financial pressure off your shoulders,

17:22.079 --> 17:24.250
knowing you can't live without it.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.310
Oh, she's good.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.310
Why would Mom want to kill me?

17:28.380 --> 17:29.650
I don't know.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.380
Why do I want to kill you?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.410
Why does your ex-wife want to kill you?

17:33.480 --> 17:36.280
You just bring that out in people.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.780
You're being ridiculous.

17:37.850 --> 17:41.110
Okay, okay, let's look at the alternate explanation.

17:41.150 --> 17:43.110
For the first time in her life,

17:43.180 --> 17:44.850
our mother is being totay selfless

17:44.910 --> 17:46.710
and thinking about someone else's well-being.

17:48.710 --> 17:52.310
Dear God, my own mother is trying to kill me.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.480
Well, I'm glad we got that settled.

17:54.550 --> 17:57.550
It was really bugging me.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.280
Terrific sandwich.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.550
Yeah.

18:08.610 --> 18:09.880
I think you'll find

18:09.950 --> 18:12.080
the fire gave everything a nice 
smoky flavor.

18:13.650 --> 18:14.980
Just out of curiosity,

18:15.050 --> 18:16.980
what does a used fire truck go for?

18:21.050 --> 18:22.710
Hey, Alan, I got an idea

18:22.780 --> 18:24.380
that might cheer you up.

18:24.450 --> 18:26.110
I'm listening.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.750
You need a carrot and a stick 
to make your life meaningful?

18:28.810 --> 18:30.580
How about this?

18:30.650 --> 18:33.580
Every month I let you give me a 
small amount of money

18:33.650 --> 18:36.480
in exchange for the pleasure of 
living in my house.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.650
We'll call it... rent.

18:41.710 --> 18:45.510
Wow, it's been a long time since I paid rent.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.910
Five years, two months, 11 days.

18:47.980 --> 18:49.550
Interesting.

18:49.610 --> 18:52.150
It would certainly give me a reason 
to go back to work.

18:52.210 --> 18:55.010
Right. That's the carrot.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.450
And if you fall behind, I get to hit 
you with a stick.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.050
Very funny.

19:00.110 --> 19:01.210
No, I'm serious.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.550
That's my carrot.

19:02.610 --> 19:05.210
ok how much did you have in mind?

19:05.280 --> 19:08.450
Well, I've given it some thought...and...

19:12.950 --> 19:15.280
I think you'll find this to be a fair number.

19:17.350 --> 19:21.250
Oh, well, uh,

19:21.310 --> 19:22.580
at least if I'm paying rent

19:22.650 --> 19:24.610
I'll get a say in what goes on around here.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.610
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.680
No.

19:30.350 --> 19:32.250
If you want a say,

19:32.310 --> 19:34.680
this is the number.

19:36.710 --> 19:39.950
I don't need a say.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.110
Good.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.430
So, every month on the first.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.710
Deal.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.580
All right, all right, I feel good 
about this,

19:49.650 --> 19:51.610
pitching in, pulling my own weight.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.180
It's long overdue.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.150
Five years, two months, 11 days.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.950
Right.

19:57.010 --> 19:58.980
N, uh, course since the month has already started,

19:59.050 --> 20:00.380
we'll, we'll start next month.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.510
Fine.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.810
Uh, although, uh, with the holidays coming,

20:03.880 --> 20:05.880
maybe it'd be better to start fresh 
with the new year,

20:05.950 --> 20:07.210
you know? 1/1.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.310
Sure, whatever. Okay.

20:09.380 --> 20:11.980
Unless the economy's still in the tank.

20:12.050 --> 20:13.980
Always a possibility.

20:14.050 --> 20:15.380
In which case, you know,

20:15.450 --> 20:17.480
we'll, uh, we'll probably want to 
revisit the number.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.810
Probably.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.110
I mean, the market is-is pretty 
volatile right now.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.780
I mean, I think some belt-tightening

20:25.850 --> 20:27.210
is in order for everybody, you know,

20:27.280 --> 20:28.950
landlords and-and tenants alike.

20:28.980 --> 20:30.380
Ow!
