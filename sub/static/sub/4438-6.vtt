00:02.085 --> 00:04.304
( Lightning crashing )

00:07.841 --> 00:11.596
( footsteps approaching )

00:11.762 --> 00:13.605
Well, hello there,
traveler.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.775
I see your car broke down
on this lonesome country road,

00:16.975 --> 00:19.728
a place so remote that no one
can hear your screams!

00:19.937 --> 00:20.904
( Footsteps retreating )

00:21.104 --> 00:22.481
Pretend I didn't say that.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.487
Come in, come in,
but be warned,

00:24.691 --> 00:28.491
if you enter you may be
subjected to my tales.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.040
Tales designed
to sell my merchandise!

00:32.198 --> 00:35.123
( Evil laughter )

00:37.329 --> 00:38.501
Sorry, I was thinking

00:38.705 --> 00:40.127
of something funny
I heard earlier.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.422
You've come to
the Mystery Shack after-hours,

01:24.626 --> 01:26.424
a time when only
our creepiest

01:26.628 --> 01:28.722
and most cursed objects
are for sale,

01:28.880 --> 01:30.598
like that thing there!

01:30.799 --> 01:31.891
( Thunder cracking )

01:32.092 --> 01:33.014
No, not a fan?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.765
Too many orifices?

01:34.970 --> 01:37.064
All right, I can tell
what you're looking for

01:37.264 --> 01:39.266
is this disembodied hand.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.851
Why is it so expensive?

01:41.059 --> 01:43.278
Well, that's quite a tale

01:43.478 --> 01:46.778
and it's called Hands Off!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.905
No, seriously, hands off,
that's not for sale.

01:49.109 --> 01:49.985
All right.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.820
Hands Off!

01:56.575 --> 01:58.873
Swap meet!
Swap meet! Swap meet!

01:59.077 --> 02:01.000
Look at all these
priceless treasures.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.791
Bobbly-heads!

02:03.999 --> 02:05.751
They agree with
everything I say.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.336
Professor glasses!

02:07.544 --> 02:08.966
They make me look
like a genius.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.969
(groans)

02:11.173 --> 02:13.141
Look at these
faux-gold beauties.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.265
They're mob-boss quality.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.310
All right, kids,

02:19.514 --> 02:22.643
prepare to watch
the delicate art of the deal.

02:22.851 --> 02:23.898
Hey, hag-face!

02:24.102 --> 02:26.070
How much
for the junk watches?

02:26.271 --> 02:28.069
They are not for sale.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.072
Not for you,
Stan Pines!

02:31.276 --> 02:32.778
The wind
whispers your name!

02:32.986 --> 02:33.703
( Wind blowing )

02:33.904 --> 02:35.326
( chimes tinkling )

02:35.530 --> 02:37.532
Shh...
Shush, you guys.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.163
All right, I get it,
you're creepy.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.666
Anyway, less talky,
more watchy!

02:41.870 --> 02:45.295
Get your hands
off my watch!

02:45.499 --> 02:46.716
Ugh!

02:46.917 --> 02:48.464
Yeesh!
Freak show.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.513
Wow, someone needs to work
on their social skills.

02:51.713 --> 02:52.805
And their observation skills.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.261
Boom!

02:54.466 --> 02:56.889
Good job, heisting hands.
Mwah, mwah.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.064
Grunkle Stan, are you seriously
shoplifting from a witch?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.640
That sounded
like a curse.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.475
"That sounded
like a curse!"

03:03.642 --> 03:05.440
Hey, anyone want
to buy a wet blanket?

03:05.602 --> 03:07.070
We got a wet blanket
for sale!

03:07.270 --> 03:08.863
( laughter )

03:09.064 --> 03:12.944
I can't survive
in this market.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.529
( Alarm beeping )

03:15.737 --> 03:16.829
Ha, curse.

03:17.030 --> 03:17.872
Yeah, right.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.575
Ah!

03:19.783 --> 03:22.457
Wait, is this curse ugly
or normal ugly?

03:22.661 --> 03:25.084
Looks like
I got off scot-free.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.634
( Screaming )

03:29.835 --> 03:31.132
All right, kiddos,
breakfast time.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.428
Prepare your mouths for--

03:32.629 --> 03:33.801
( Waddles oinking )

03:33.964 --> 03:36.137
Whoa! Whoa-ah!
No hands!

03:36.341 --> 03:38.844
Grunkle Stan,
what happened to your hands?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.929
So I might have
got cursed a little,

03:41.138 --> 03:42.606
but the watch
looks nice, right?

03:42.806 --> 03:47.778
Foolish man, thieving hands
find wicked face!

03:47.978 --> 03:50.777
You must return
what isn't yours...

03:50.981 --> 03:51.823
That's better.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.741
I told you,
Grunkle Stan,

03:53.942 --> 03:55.740
you got to give that
watch back and apologize.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.945
What?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.997
That old crone
should apologize to me

03:59.197 --> 04:01.450
for denying my right
to buy cheap junk.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.002
I don't need hands,
I've got self respect.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.419
Mabel, sweetie, will you
make your uncle some hands?

04:11.626 --> 04:13.128
La-la-la.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.464
Hands makeover!

04:15.672 --> 04:17.673
Say hello
to your "new hands"!

04:17.841 --> 04:18.683
In quotes.

04:18.841 --> 04:19.809
Nice work, kid.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.808
See, hands are overrated.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.889
I'm ready
to take on the clay!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.316
Ma'am.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.859
( Screams )

04:31.480 --> 04:34.029
(groans)

04:36.193 --> 04:37.866
Hey, Mr. Pines.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.164
Should we play toss me
a dozen eggs like we always do?

04:41.323 --> 04:43.496
No, Jimmy, wait!
Not today!

04:43.700 --> 04:45.623
Not today!

04:48.205 --> 04:49.627
Let's find that witch.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.669
MABEL: According
to the swap meet pamphlet,

04:53.877 --> 04:55.504
the hand witch lives
in a horrible hand witch lair

04:55.712 --> 04:56.634
on Hand Witch Mountain.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.590
STAN: Stop saying hand witch!

05:02.093 --> 05:04.437
Grunkle Stan, did you
just tap my shoulder?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.810
Kid, I can't
tap anything.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.443
Guys, can you stop tapping
both my shoulders?

05:10.602 --> 05:12.946
( Hands tapping )

05:15.440 --> 05:17.488
( screaming )

05:19.861 --> 05:21.863
Hands!
Lots of hands!

05:23.990 --> 05:24.832
Ah!

05:30.455 --> 05:32.298
Ah!

05:32.499 --> 05:33.842
( Screaming )

05:34.000 --> 05:36.844
( evil laughter )

05:37.003 --> 05:39.426
Look at this touching scene.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.974
Up top!

05:41.174 --> 05:42.801
You guys,
YOU guys get me.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.807
All right, you horrible wench,
you got me.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.684
Stealing is wrong,
etcetera, take it.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.686
Now can I have
my hands back?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.313
I have a certain gesture
I'd like to share with you.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.568
Alas, your hands cannot
be gotten so easily.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.742
The spirits say, um...

05:58.942 --> 06:03.368
that the curse can
only be broken by a kiss!

06:03.572 --> 06:04.869
ALL: What?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.791
It's all right, kids.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.335
Just look away.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.840
A kiss on the lips!

06:13.999 --> 06:16.843
What? Forget it! I'm not
kissing any of that mess.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.379
I don't need
my hands that bad.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.214
Yeah, you're just
making stuff up now.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.514
Let's go, kids.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.467
No, wait!
Don't go!

06:23.675 --> 06:25.052
You're right,
you're right.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.638
I was just making
all that stuff up.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.224
Just trying to get
something going, you know.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.230
So hard to meet
people these days.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.811
( Snaps fingers )

06:34.019 --> 06:36.272
So this was all just
a ploy to get a date?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.776
I'm desperate, okay?

06:37.981 --> 06:39.779
But every time I bring
someone back here

06:39.983 --> 06:43.362
without keeping their hands
hostage, they just run away!

06:43.570 --> 06:45.243
Well, yeah, look
at this horror show.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.078
It's creepy
even for a cave!

06:47.240 --> 06:48.833
You just need
to redecorate.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.786
For example...

06:50.994 --> 06:53.042
A ha ndela bra!

06:54.331 --> 06:56.709
Ooh,
the hand witch likes.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.009
Then watch me work.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.213
Home makeover!

07:04.466 --> 07:05.433
Redecorate.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.804
Redo you.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.687
Change it around.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.610
You got to do it
to make it work.

07:17.312 --> 07:20.942
Okay. Time to take a look
at your fantastic new cave.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.947
( Qasps )

07:23.151 --> 07:25.449
MABEL: Men will definitely
tolerate you now.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.282
And I left a book of pickup
lines on the end table.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.538
Blah!
Oh, my goodness!

07:30.742 --> 07:32.369
I can't believe
this is the same cave!

07:32.577 --> 07:33.703
0h, my goodness!

07:33.912 --> 07:35.755
I just can't
find the words.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.754
How about "Here's
your hands back"?

07:37.958 --> 07:38.959
On, right.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.714
( Snaps fingers )

07:40.919 --> 07:43.422
( tapping )

07:44.881 --> 07:46.474
Shaky, Scratchy.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.302
I've missed you
old rascals.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.978
You're all right,
sister.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.310
Will you be
my boyfriend now?

07:53.515 --> 07:54.687
No, never.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.689
Well,
I learned nothing.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.113
Back to my crippling
loneliness.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.782
Hey, I'm lost
in these mountains.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.826
Could I crash here
for the night?

08:05.026 --> 08:07.654
Please, come in. Uh...

08:08.697 --> 08:09.619
( clears throat )

08:09.823 --> 08:11.825
"Girl, are those space pants?

08:12.033 --> 08:15.003
Because your butt looks
out of this world."

08:15.161 --> 08:16.788
Wow.
Thanks for noticing.

08:16.997 --> 08:17.998
Yes!

08:18.999 --> 08:21.172
All right, I get it.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.799
You don't want the hand,
you're a savvy customer.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.886
But perhaps you'd be
interested in buying, um...

08:28.925 --> 08:30.552
this magic pig.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.221
Sure he doesn't look magic,

08:32.429 --> 08:34.557
but there
is a very interesting story

08:34.722 --> 08:35.849
I'm about
to make up about him,

08:36.057 --> 08:38.650
and it's called
Abaconings!

08:42.938 --> 08:44.361
"The What-The-Heck-A-Hedron!

08:44.566 --> 08:46.239
Solve this test
of intelligence

08:46.401 --> 08:49.245
and your photo
could be on this box."

08:49.404 --> 08:52.157
Whoa. That's false advertising
I can get behind.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.543
( Buzzing )

08:55.744 --> 08:56.745
Come on.

08:56.953 --> 08:57.749
( Buzzing )

08:57.954 --> 08:58.796
Ugh!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.465
MABEL: Ooh, that's a bummer.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.839
This is May May and The Hogg
coming at you on the AM.

09:04.002 --> 09:04.844
(Oinks)

09:05.003 --> 09:06.004
Whoa!

09:06.212 --> 09:08.010
Not sure we can say
that on the air.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.716
Don't touch
that dial, truckers,

09:09.883 --> 09:11.305
'cause The Hogg
just ate it.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.726
( Honking, farts )

09:12.927 --> 09:14.520
Mabel,
could you knock it off?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.522
I'm trying to solve
this intelligence puzzle,

09:16.681 --> 09:17.807
but it seems impossible.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.108
( Buzzing )

09:19.309 --> 09:21.403
Maybe you're just
not smart enough.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.819
We'll see about that.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.739
Buried near the falls is
the legendary percepshroom.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.448
To increase brain power,
grind it up

09:33.656 --> 09:35.158
and apply to
the forehead overnight.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.129
Tomorrow, I own you!

09:42.874 --> 09:44.592
( Snoring )

09:45.877 --> 09:47.254
( sniffs )

10:01.101 --> 10:04.571
(oinking )

10:06.773 --> 10:07.865
Ha-ha!

10:08.066 --> 10:09.443
I feel smarter already.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.120
The digits
of pi are 3.1...

10:12.278 --> 10:13.279
Um...

10:13.488 --> 10:15.957
<i>415926 etcetera.</i>

10:16.157 --> 10:17.500
What?
Who said that?

10:17.700 --> 10:18.622
Mabel?

10:18.827 --> 10:20.420
Whoa!
Dipper, look.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.336
<i>Greetings, friends.
It is I, Waddles the pig.</i>

10:27.544 --> 10:29.012
What?
Waddles, what happened to you?

10:29.212 --> 10:31.681
Have you been possessed
by the spirit of a nerd?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.842
<i>I understand my transformation
may be vexing,</i>

10:34.050 --> 10:36.678
<i>but I have prepared
a presentation.</i>

10:36.886 --> 10:40.857
<i>Forgive me. My pig arms
are cute and useless.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:43.856
The brain goop! You ate it
and built all this, didn't you?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.061
This isn't right!

10:45.270 --> 10:47.739
The pig goes oink.
The pig goes oink!

10:47.939 --> 10:49.691
<i>Now the pig goes
wherever he can shine</i>

10:49.899 --> 10:52.698
<i>the light of knowledge into
the darkness of ignorance.</i>

10:52.902 --> 10:54.324
Whoa!
What the heck-a-hedron!

10:54.529 --> 10:56.156
How did you do that?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.700
<i>I can teach you, Dipper.
I can teach you many things.</i>

10:58.908 --> 11:01.206

Man, I am loving
this new Waddles.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.387
Yeah,
he's, uh, he's definitely...

11:11.588 --> 11:12.680
different.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.802
( Bleats )

11:17.010 --> 11:19.012
Dude, that rocket cart
is amazing!

11:19.220 --> 11:20.893
You and me
should go invent stuff.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.600
Uh, Waddles,
don't you want to stay up here

11:23.808 --> 11:25.810
and record some
morning pranks with me?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.771
Mabel,
this pig's got a gift.

11:27.979 --> 11:28.980
He needs to share it
with the world.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.782
<i>I'm sorry, Mabel.</i>

11:30.982 --> 11:32.825
<i>There is more to life than

11:33.026 --> 11:35.028
<i>and laughing
at those fart noises.</i>

11:35.236 --> 11:36.328
<i>I see that now.</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:38.327
( chuckling )

11:38.531 --> 11:42.286
Yeah, you guys
just go on without me.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.209
Oh, my kite got
stuck in a tree.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.090
I hate everything!

11:51.294 --> 11:53.012
I bet we could be
of service.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.511
Ah! An affront
against nature!

11:55.715 --> 11:56.932
<i>Ha! Forget kites.</i>

11:57.133 --> 11:59.386

11:59.594 --> 12:01.471

You're not happier
like this, are you?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.762
( Crash )

12:42.971 --> 12:45.599
Ha-ha. This is
your greatest invention yet.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.855
It could solve

13:03.950 --> 13:06.794
Solving that brain puzzle
was just the tip of the iceberg.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.918
With this, Waddles will be
able to solve

13:09.080 --> 13:10.957
all the greatest puzzles
of the universe.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.173
<i>The origin of life.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.722
I wonder if I can teach him
to wear pants.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.102
The whole world?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.900
But when will you have

13:34.480 --> 13:36.107
But what about
helping me?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.785
Do you really want to spend
your whole life in meetings

13:38.985 --> 13:40.532

13:40.737 --> 13:43.240
This brain junk has made you

14:37.919 --> 14:39.967
No!
Our invention!

14:40.171 --> 14:42.765
I know what will make you
feel better.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.347
A simple hug
from a simple pig.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.724
Yeah, guess so.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.856
( laughs )

14:53.309 --> 14:54.731
Good pig. Ugh.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.356
You know what? You're right.
Don't buy the pig.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.150
In fact I'm better off
leaving it with my niece.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.450
( Arrow twanging )

15:01.651 --> 15:03.403
No shooting in the house,
sweetie.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.865
But perhaps I could interest you
in something else.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.872
Like these
spooky movies!

15:10.076 --> 15:11.248
Movies are great.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.420
You watch the movie,
you scare the girl,

15:13.621 --> 15:14.838
the girl snuggles up
next to you.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.541
Next thing you know,
you got to raise a kid,

15:16.749 --> 15:17.875
your life falls apart.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.089
Forget that last part.

This next tale is called
Clay Day!

GIRL: ( on TV ) <i>You did it,
Shimmery Twinkleheart!</i>

15:28.636 --> 15:30.104
<i>No, you did it,

15:30.304 --> 15:33.228
<i>Because you believed

15:33.433 --> 15:35.106
Everything
about this is bad.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.606
Well, that just
put me 90 minutes

15:36.811 --> 15:37.858
closer to death.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.109
It's time you kids

15:40.440 --> 15:42.408
Ooh, old people movies.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.702
Get ready for references
we don't understand

15:44.902 --> 15:45.949
and words
we can't repeat.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.494
<i>You're no match

Oh, no! Mabel!

16:00.543 --> 16:01.886
Well,
your sister is broken.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.509
Oh, Grunkle Stan,
I should have told you before

16:04.714 --> 16:06.432
that Mabel
has a childhood terror

16:06.632 --> 16:08.634
of old-timey stop-motion
animation.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.224
It's like her number one fear
since we were kids.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.807
( Chuckles ) Come on,
those hokey old things,

16:14.015 --> 16:15.483
how scared could she be?

16:16.893 --> 16:20.488
The Cyclops! His face
is made of nightmares!

16:20.688 --> 16:22.611
Kid, it's just a movie.
It can't hurt you.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.611
No talking.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.692
They wait for you to talk

16:24.901 --> 16:26.903
and then crawl
inside your mouth!

16:27.111 --> 16:28.909
Why did you have
to show her that tape?

16:29.113 --> 16:30.831
There's got to be a way
to get her over this!

16:34.452 --> 16:35.419
Huh...

16:39.040 --> 16:41.134
All right, if we can just
get the director to show her

16:41.334 --> 16:43.507
the models are fake,
maybe she'll finally calm down.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.507
I don't know, dude.

16:44.712 --> 16:45.713
According to the internet,

16:45.880 --> 16:46.881
special effects genius
Harry Claymore

16:47.089 --> 16:48.432
is some kind of recluse.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.307
Man wants his privacy.
I can respect that.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.773
Well, everyone
over the fence.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.601
You see, Mabel, those monsters
are just tiny clay figures

16:58.809 --> 17:01.858
moved around one frame at
a time by an antisocial shut-in.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.236
Those people
are called animators.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.032
Hello?
( echoes )

17:07.234 --> 17:09.407
Mr. Claymore?

17:09.612 --> 17:11.239
We want to get a look
at your figurines.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.119
We're not paparazzi.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.622
Aha!

17:15.826 --> 17:18.249
See, Mabel, it's all just
special effects.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.501
You can come out.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.580
MABEL: NO!

17:20.790 --> 17:21.586
Kid, listen to me.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.883
For the last time,

17:23.041 --> 17:25.715
there is nothing here
to be afraid of--

( screaming )

17:31.050 --> 17:31.972
(groans)

17:33.261 --> 17:34.979
It's slowly...

17:36.138 --> 17:37.685
swiping at us!

17:37.890 --> 17:40.234
Let's escape by
standing still!

17:40.434 --> 17:42.562
Oh, it didn't work!

17:42.770 --> 17:45.239
( Screaming )

17:47.567 --> 17:48.864
Whoa!

17:57.743 --> 18:00.587
How is this happening?
What do they want?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.916
HARRY: I'm afraid
they want you.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.587
Harry Claymore,
master of special effects,

18:07.795 --> 18:09.593
circa 1970 something.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.347
Alas, my effects
are more special than you know.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.053
What? But how are
these things real?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.057
What about stop motion?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.309
What?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.605
Do you really
believe someone

18:18.764 --> 18:20.562
moves these figures
one frame at a time?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.147
I'm not a masochist.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.900
I used black magic to make them
animate themselves.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.277
It was great at first,
but one day...

18:32.069 --> 18:33.571
[[511

18:33.779 --> 18:35.747
Where's the heart?!

18:35.948 --> 18:37.700
<i>HARRY: Now that they were
out of work,</i>

18:37.908 --> 18:40.912
<i>they went mad
and enslaved me!</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:44.294
And now they will turn you
into unholy beasts of clay

18:44.498 --> 18:45.966
to join in their mischief!

18:46.167 --> 18:47.510
Well, Mr. Pines,
at least you'll finally

18:47.710 --> 18:49.303
get to work with
your favorite director.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.302
And by work, I mean, suffocate
inside a big wad of clay.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.680
DIPPER: Help!

18:54.842 --> 18:55.764
Somebody help us!

18:55.968 --> 18:56.719
Help!

18:56.927 --> 18:58.179
Oh, what do I do?

18:58.387 --> 19:01.061
How can I defeat
those monstrosities?

19:04.560 --> 19:07.564
Hey, I changed it into
something I like.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.696
Whoa.
I think I have an idea!

19:12.026 --> 19:13.824
Hey, one-eyed-clops!

19:14.028 --> 19:15.746
Yeah, I'm talking to you,

19:30.920 --> 19:33.594
Oh, I've got big plans for you!

19:33.798 --> 19:35.391
Hey, skeleton dorks!

19:35.591 --> 19:37.969
It's "clayback" time!

19:38.177 --> 19:39.929
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.433
Dude, you conquered
your fear.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.819
That's right. Because
she believed in herself.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.271
Can it, Twinkleheart!

19:48.479 --> 19:50.698
Just start pounding
those skeletons!

19:53.484 --> 19:54.827
Mabel, you did it.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.244
So you're not scared
anymore?

19:56.404 --> 19:58.247
Oh, I'm scared
twice as much now,

19:58.447 --> 20:00.745
but now I know
it's rational.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.419
Kid, I'm sorry I doubted you.
You were right.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.587
Stop motion is
pure evil.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.665
And probably
really expensive.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.546
Incredibly expensive.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.800
This is an impressive
fight though.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.714
I'm glad
I'm facing towards it.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.595
ALL: Yay!

20:17.800 --> 20:18.892
That was the best part.

20:25.891 --> 20:29.395
Well, I think today we learned
that you can remold your fears.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.940
I'm just glad none of us
got turned into clay.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.274
Holy Toledo!

20:34.984 --> 20:37.157
Who wants to see me
change into most anything?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.822
( Humming )

20:40.030 --> 20:41.873
I can walk
through walls.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.371
Whoa!

20:44.410 --> 20:46.128
We're safe now, kids.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.875
We're safe.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.381
I don't get it.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.255
You don't want the pig,
you don't want my tapes,

20:51.459 --> 20:53.132
what are you gonna buy?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.758
How about this
delicious potion?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.764
Here, have
a free sample.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.175
(glugging )

21:03.763 --> 21:04.810
( thud )

21:05.014 --> 21:06.140
STAN: You should
have bought my merch

21:06.348 --> 21:08.350
when you had the chance,
buddy.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.061
But that's okay.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.738
I'll have something new
for sale very soon.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.565
( Chuckling )

21:16.859 --> 21:18.657
And here we have
our latest attraction.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.909
The legendary
Cheapskate!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.865
I saw it blinking.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.746
Just an optical illusion.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.327
Come along, everyone.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.458
Step right up! ( laughs )

21:31.999 --> 21:33.672
That's right,
I'm a jerk.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.799
Hey, want to play
tic-tac-toe?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.684
Hey, I wanted to be Xs,
let me be Xs.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.515
Trust me,
just let her be Xs.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.891
( Sighs )

21:45.095 --> 21:47.063
Yay!

21:47.264 --> 21:49.858
Actually I'm sorry.
I changed my mind, I'll be Os.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.900
Okay, you're gonna
hate me right now,

21:53.103 --> 21:55.197
but is Xs still
a possibility?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.657
I don't think
you're playing this right.
