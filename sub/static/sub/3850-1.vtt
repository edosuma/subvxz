10:28.186 --> 10:30.086
Look, see? There she is.

10:30.111 --> 10:31.642
She's fine.

10:32.245 --> 10:33.377
"She's missing."

10:33.402 --> 10:34.835
[Cellphone vibrates]

10:41.679 --> 10:42.711
What does it say?

10:48.686 --> 10:51.110
- What the hell does that mean?
- Did you tell Savi?

10:51.135 --> 10:52.475
- Tell Savi what?
- Where I was.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.630
Of course not. I-I didn't even
know where you were until I called.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.655
- No, but you knew about the kiss.
- What kiss?

10:57.690 --> 10:59.390
Yes, but I thought it
was a one-time thing.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.557
It <i> was</i> a one-time thing!

11:00.593 --> 11:01.926
Until... it wasn't.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.861
A one-time thing with who?
What the hell is happening?

11:03.896 --> 11:05.062
[Sighs]

11:07.248 --> 11:09.148
Harry kissed Joss.

11:09.219 --> 11:10.626
And then I kissed Harry.

11:10.651 --> 11:11.929
You kissed Harry?!

11:12.087 --> 11:13.453
When did you kiss him?

11:13.813 --> 11:14.943
When did she kiss him?

11:14.968 --> 11:16.401
- Yesterday.
- And today.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.026
- Today?!
- Today?!

11:18.095 --> 11:19.994
What? When? Where?

11:20.030 --> 11:21.162
Joss!

11:21.198 --> 11:22.964
When I was supposed to
be walking down the aisle,

11:22.999 --> 11:25.400
I saw Harry in the window, and
I followed him down to the beach.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.770
- Oh, my God.
- He told me that he was in love with me.

11:27.795 --> 11:28.961
Oh, my God!

11:28.997 --> 11:30.396
And then... and then we
started kissing and then...

11:30.431 --> 11:31.731
Tell me you didn't.

11:31.766 --> 11:33.899
No! But it was... It was
definitely going there.

11:33.935 --> 11:36.002
But there's no way that
Savi could have seen.

11:36.037 --> 11:38.704
I mean, we were all the
way down by the ocean.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.363
Oh, my God.

11:40.397 --> 11:42.330
Savi, it's me. Please pick up.

11:42.810 --> 11:44.977
Oh, my God. This can't be happening!

11:45.013 --> 11:47.811
What... there's... she couldn't
have possibly found out.

11:47.836 --> 11:49.035
We were... We were out by the beach.

11:49.071 --> 11:50.570
She was all the way up
with the wedding guests.

11:50.606 --> 11:52.239
No, she wasn't.

11:52.274 --> 11:53.273
What do you mean she wasn't?

11:53.308 --> 11:54.574
She was helping me look for Lucy

11:54.610 --> 11:55.842
before the ceremony started.

11:55.877 --> 11:58.411
Lucy was playing down at
the beach in the morning.

11:58.447 --> 12:00.947
It would make sense that
Savi would have gone there.

12:05.387 --> 12:07.220
Oh, my God.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.724
[Voice breaking] Oh, my God.

12:10.759 --> 12:12.125
Oh, my God.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.227
[Door opens, closes]

12:14.263 --> 12:16.463
Joss: Savi? Savi, are you...

12:23.138 --> 12:24.471
Savi?

12:28.350 --> 12:29.750
[Sighs]

12:31.013 --> 12:33.246
[Sighing] Oh, my God.

12:33.282 --> 12:34.976
[Ringing]

12:35.651 --> 12:38.159
<i>Hi. This is Savi.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

12:38.184 --> 12:39.921
- [Beep]
- Savi, it's me.

12:39.957 --> 12:41.790
Can you please call me back, please?

12:41.825 --> 12:43.859
Please. I really need to talk to you.

12:44.425 --> 12:45.891
[Sighs]

12:50.767 --> 12:53.017
It's a lot to take in.

12:53.135 --> 12:54.634
I understand if you need time

12:54.670 --> 12:56.536
to think about everything before we...

12:56.571 --> 12:58.579
- So, dad was cheating on you.
- Yes.

12:58.604 --> 13:00.286
And that's why he pretended to be dead...

13:00.311 --> 13:01.785
Because he loved the other lady more.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.143
That may have been a part of it.

13:03.178 --> 13:04.778
But <i> she</i> thought he was dead, too.

13:04.813 --> 13:06.646
No, she <i> pretended</i>
to think he was dead

13:06.682 --> 13:08.148
to try and get money from me,

13:08.183 --> 13:10.016
which is how I found out
he <i> wasn't</i> dead.

13:10.052 --> 13:11.518
Because dad came here to our house.

13:11.553 --> 13:14.154
Yes. And I wanted to tell you then, Lucy...

13:14.189 --> 13:15.875
But Daniel knew the whole time.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.134
Well, yes.

13:17.159 --> 13:18.725
- But he didn't tell you.
- No.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.047
So he lied to you, too.

13:20.072 --> 13:22.510
This is what I'm trying to explain.

13:22.624 --> 13:24.484
Most of what happened...

13:24.509 --> 13:26.175
I don't like to call myself a victim,

13:26.200 --> 13:28.700
but, I mean, I <i> was... </i> A victim.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.123
Because everyone lied to you.

13:30.148 --> 13:32.034
[Sighs] Exactly.

13:32.059 --> 13:34.274
But the whole time, <i>you</i>
were lying to <i> me.</i>

13:35.295 --> 13:37.095
Lucy.

13:37.545 --> 13:39.411
What can I say? I'm sorry.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.086
I don't forgive you.

13:44.729 --> 13:45.862
Dom: So...

13:46.795 --> 13:48.728
How was the engagement party?

13:48.764 --> 13:50.038
Uhh...

13:50.063 --> 13:52.941
Actually, it was... a surprise wedding.

13:53.161 --> 13:54.894
Oh. I didn't know.

13:54.919 --> 13:55.951
Me neither.

13:55.976 --> 13:57.876
Listen, I don't mean to
cut to the chase, Dom,

13:57.901 --> 14:00.268
but have you talked to Savi lately?

14:00.293 --> 14:02.126
Like in the last 24 hours?

14:02.151 --> 14:04.318
As a matter of fact, she
called the office last night.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.909
- She did?
- To quit her job.

14:06.101 --> 14:07.534
She what?!

14:07.559 --> 14:09.726
Yeah, that was... [chuckles]...
That was <i> my</i> reaction.

14:09.751 --> 14:11.718
Did not go over well with the partners.

14:11.753 --> 14:13.486
Did she say why, Dom?
Or where she was going?

14:13.522 --> 14:14.955
She wouldn't do something like this

14:14.990 --> 14:16.356
without having something lined up.

14:16.391 --> 14:17.390
No, I don't know.

14:17.426 --> 14:19.723
She, um... She called Mitchell.

14:20.295 --> 14:23.496
I had to hear about all this from... him.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.032
I see.

14:27.069 --> 14:28.201
She... She didn't call you.

14:29.438 --> 14:30.570
No.

14:31.573 --> 14:33.840
Look, she doesn't owe me anything.

14:34.780 --> 14:38.666
Maybe she'll call when she figures
out what it is she actually wants.

14:39.214 --> 14:42.182
Hopefully, by then, I
won't care so damn much.

14:43.110 --> 14:44.776
I'm really sorry, Dom.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.928
Yeah.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.478
Me too.

14:50.907 --> 14:52.212
Karen.

14:52.956 --> 14:54.122
Thank you for coming.

14:54.147 --> 14:55.989
Of course, Dr. Adams.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.583
But your nurse didn't indicate
what this meeting was about.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.908
That's because she doesn't know.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.483
Oh.

15:03.891 --> 15:06.258
I'm still H.I.V. negative, right?

15:06.283 --> 15:07.922
Yes, of course. But...

15:08.089 --> 15:09.345
I have cancer.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.870
What? No.

15:10.905 --> 15:12.208
No, you're in perfect health.

15:12.324 --> 15:14.951
The reason I want to talk to
you in person is because...

15:14.976 --> 15:16.509
- I'm pregnant.
- Please stop talking.

15:18.212 --> 15:20.343
You're not sick. You're not pregnant.

15:20.368 --> 15:22.201
What you do have is a
very rare blood type...

15:22.517 --> 15:24.583
AB RH negative. Are you aware of that?

15:24.619 --> 15:26.252
Of my blood type? Yes.

15:26.287 --> 15:27.820
I've been searching for several years,

15:27.855 --> 15:30.022
and you're the first patient
I've come across who has it.

15:30.057 --> 15:31.824
Well... Technically, the second.

15:31.859 --> 15:33.692
I'm sorry... I don't
understand what's happening.

15:33.728 --> 15:34.794
I have a patient

15:34.829 --> 15:36.862
who is suffering from
severe aplastic anemia.

15:36.898 --> 15:38.998
She was diagnosed a little
over three years ago,

15:39.033 --> 15:41.500
and we're having trouble
finding a blood match for her...

15:42.012 --> 15:43.044
Until now.

15:43.079 --> 15:44.846
You want me to donate blood.

15:44.881 --> 15:46.697
It's a little more complicated than that.

15:46.722 --> 15:48.157
I'm sorry... uh...

15:48.222 --> 15:51.177
How exactly did you come
to know my blood type?

15:51.254 --> 15:53.521
Is that something that normally comes up

15:53.556 --> 15:55.290
in standard H.I.V. testing?

15:56.593 --> 15:58.059
I profiled your blood.

15:58.094 --> 16:00.328
Patient has a great-grandmother
who's Korean.

16:00.363 --> 16:01.529
Odds of a match increase

16:01.564 --> 16:03.998
when two people share
certain genetic identifiers.

16:04.034 --> 16:07.302
You... profiled my blood?

16:07.722 --> 16:09.869
Do you have any idea how unethical...

16:09.894 --> 16:10.926
I do.

16:10.962 --> 16:12.936
- I could sue you.
- You could.

16:13.869 --> 16:15.530
If that's your choice, I understand.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.229
But the reality is...

16:19.592 --> 16:20.824
I'm out of options.

16:22.407 --> 16:24.054
Patient is my wife.

16:24.976 --> 16:26.229
She's dying.

16:26.577 --> 16:28.310
And there's nothing I wouldn't do,

16:28.335 --> 16:31.202
no rule I wouldn't break to save her life.

16:36.220 --> 16:37.621
So, Savi knows.

16:38.523 --> 16:39.820
Does Scott?

16:40.558 --> 16:42.691
Does... Scott?

16:42.727 --> 16:44.803
- Mm.
- Is that... Is that really

16:44.828 --> 16:46.449
what you're worried about right now, Harry?

16:46.485 --> 16:48.218
There's a chance that Savi saw everything

16:48.253 --> 16:49.986
that happened on the beach... Everything.

16:50.021 --> 16:51.354
Is that not horrifying to you?

16:51.389 --> 16:52.822
Mm, it's not ideal.

16:52.858 --> 16:53.923
Certainly not the way

16:53.959 --> 16:55.492
I'd have liked to present
it to her, but hey.

16:55.527 --> 16:57.427
She hasn't spoken to
anyone since it happened...

16:57.462 --> 16:58.962
Not me, not Karen, not even April.

16:58.997 --> 16:59.929
She's completely M.I.A.

16:59.965 --> 17:01.431
No one has any idea where she is.

17:01.466 --> 17:02.632
She's not answering her phone.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.502
Yeah, that's about right... Typical Savi.

17:05.537 --> 17:06.690
What does that mean?

17:06.714 --> 17:08.104
It means once again, she's found a way

17:08.138 --> 17:10.237
to make herself the center of attention.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.285
So instead of focusing
on what actually matters,

17:12.310 --> 17:14.109
everyone's worried about Savi.

17:14.145 --> 17:15.678
I mean, can you think of any proper reason

17:15.714 --> 17:17.714
she can't pick up the
phone and call someone...

17:17.749 --> 17:19.281
Just to let them know she's okay?

17:19.317 --> 17:21.095
Yeah... If she's not okay, Harry.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.153
That would be a really
freaking good reason.

17:23.188 --> 17:24.820
She's not dead, right? We know that.

17:24.857 --> 17:26.156
I mean, seriously, Joss.

17:26.191 --> 17:28.604
The way she's behaving...
It's bloody immature.

17:28.629 --> 17:30.809
And what right does she have, anyway?

17:30.834 --> 17:32.167
It's not like we're married.

17:32.192 --> 17:34.025
She cheated on me. She chose the other guy.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.250
Why should I feel bad about
getting on with my life?

17:36.275 --> 17:38.610
Because I'm her sister!
It's a little bit different.

17:38.635 --> 17:40.227
Yes, it <i> is</i> complicated.

17:40.252 --> 17:42.823
I'm not saying it's not... complicated.

17:42.848 --> 17:44.657
But in the end, people
work these things out,

17:44.682 --> 17:46.515
and they move on.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.007
Savi was gonna find
out about us eventually.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.857
Unless...

17:58.816 --> 18:00.025
Unless what?

18:00.788 --> 18:03.631
Unless you weren't actually
planning on telling anyone.

18:04.131 --> 18:05.464
Unless being on that beach

18:05.500 --> 18:08.501
was just a convenient way
to get out of marrying Scott.

18:09.034 --> 18:10.269
Oh, my God, Harry.

18:10.304 --> 18:12.972
S... th... I swear to
God that's not what...

18:13.007 --> 18:14.707
- I just... I... I just... I just...
- You just... you just...

18:14.742 --> 18:15.875
I-I don't know.

18:15.910 --> 18:18.704
I wasn't... I wasn't
thinking about the next step.

18:18.729 --> 18:19.895
I wasn't thinking about

18:19.930 --> 18:21.897
how we were gonna tell
Scott or Savi or anybody.

18:21.932 --> 18:25.000
I just... I just did what
felt right in the moment.

18:25.552 --> 18:28.577
Does it <i> still</i> feel
right... In the moment?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.653
[Cellphone ringing]

18:33.985 --> 18:35.894
[Ringing continues]

18:38.104 --> 18:39.504
[Sighs]

18:40.246 --> 18:42.037
Hey, can I call you right back? I...

18:44.247 --> 18:45.387
Oh, God.

18:45.922 --> 18:47.722
Yeah, okay.

18:47.967 --> 18:49.525
No, I'll be there as soon as I can.

18:49.550 --> 18:51.116
Okay. Bye.

18:58.402 --> 18:59.902
Scott's grandmother just died.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.173
[Sighs deeply] Damn it, Harry.

19:04.208 --> 19:05.807
- I can't...
- Okay.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.376
I can't. I-I just... I don't...

19:07.411 --> 19:08.443
It's okay. Uh...

19:08.479 --> 19:09.878
- Listen, listen.
- No, I'm sorry. I can't.

19:09.914 --> 19:11.313
I-I-I don't know what I'm doing. I'm...

19:11.348 --> 19:12.748
Joss, Joss. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

19:12.783 --> 19:14.950
- [Sighs deeply]
- Hey, hey, easy. It's okay.

19:14.985 --> 19:16.321
Listen.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.020
Look at me.

19:18.816 --> 19:19.821
I love you.

19:20.692 --> 19:24.793
And if you want to be with
me, I am 100% all-in, okay?

19:24.828 --> 19:26.862
We're gonna figure out
all this mess together.

19:26.897 --> 19:28.139
Okay.

19:28.866 --> 19:30.098
- Okay?
- Yeah.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.594
[Sniffles]

19:32.870 --> 19:34.390
If you don't...

19:35.206 --> 19:36.266
Please...

19:37.007 --> 19:38.759
I need to know, okay?

19:40.344 --> 19:42.277
You have to make a decision.

19:47.318 --> 19:49.084
[Sniffles]

19:58.248 --> 20:00.767
How do you donate stem cells?
Seems like it would hurt.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.091
It's pretty involved.

20:02.126 --> 20:05.061
First, I'd have to get daily shots of GCSF,

20:05.096 --> 20:08.096
then the procedure itself takes
anywhere from four to six hours.

20:08.121 --> 20:09.887
And in most cases, I have to do it twice.

20:09.922 --> 20:11.021
Then there's the chance

20:11.057 --> 20:13.057
that the cells don't
regenerate, in which case,

20:13.092 --> 20:15.059
I'd have to donate my
bone marrow directly...

20:15.094 --> 20:16.660
You had me at "daily shots."

20:16.696 --> 20:19.259
I just can't believe he
put me in this position.

20:19.766 --> 20:22.733
But now that I know, I
can't <i> not</i> know.

20:22.769 --> 20:26.103
Can I say something that I
know is going to sound stupid?

20:26.139 --> 20:28.098
Why not? I do it all the time.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.775
The other day, when I
went to your church...

20:33.079 --> 20:35.012
It was the first time in a long time

20:35.047 --> 20:39.500
I felt connected to something... bigger.

20:39.876 --> 20:41.995
And then this happens.

20:43.252 --> 20:45.289
So I can't help but wonder...

20:45.788 --> 20:47.958
Maybe it's all part of God's plan?

20:47.994 --> 20:49.527
Well, that doesn't sound stupid.

20:50.123 --> 20:53.588
But it <i> does</i> sound
like a pretty big commitment

20:53.613 --> 20:55.127
for a woman you don't even know.

20:55.152 --> 20:56.316
That's true.

20:56.341 --> 20:59.300
So maybe you should get to
know her,<i> then</i> decide.

20:59.325 --> 21:02.359
Yeah. That won't make it
more complicated at all.

21:02.384 --> 21:04.355
[Sighs] I have to pick Lucy up from soccer.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.667
Oh. How's that going?

21:06.692 --> 21:09.727
She hasn't said two words
to me since yesterday.

21:11.743 --> 21:13.643
Hey, have you heard from Savi?

21:13.668 --> 21:15.531
I sent her another text
this morning, but...

21:15.602 --> 21:16.934
Nothing.

21:18.605 --> 21:20.738
I don't blame her for being upset.

21:21.297 --> 21:23.074
I don't, either.

21:25.912 --> 21:27.311
We shouldn't talk about this.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.386
No, we shouldn't.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.754
Lucy: I need to ask you something.

21:36.789 --> 21:38.118
April: Go for it.

21:38.143 --> 21:40.627
I've been thinking a lot about it,

21:40.652 --> 21:42.766
and I think there's
something you can do for me

21:42.791 --> 21:44.725
that might help make this better.

21:44.883 --> 21:46.616
You know I'd do anything.

21:46.641 --> 21:48.653
I want to go live with grandma for a while.

21:49.707 --> 21:51.173
Anything but that.

21:51.198 --> 21:52.697
Why not?

21:52.722 --> 21:54.221
Lucy, we are not discussing this.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.546
It is simply not an option.

21:55.571 --> 21:57.137
Why do <i> you</i> get to decide everything?

21:57.547 --> 21:58.712
I don't...

21:58.737 --> 22:00.270
You decided when I could see my father.

22:00.305 --> 22:01.704
You took that choice away from me,

22:01.740 --> 22:03.606
and now he's really dead,
and I'm stuck with <i> you.</i>

22:03.642 --> 22:06.810
You're the only family that
I have, and it's not fair.

22:06.845 --> 22:08.663
I hate you!

22:11.125 --> 22:12.257
[Sighs]

22:12.282 --> 22:13.456
[Car door closes]

22:15.020 --> 22:17.287
Scott: Look, I'm just telling you
what <i> she</i> told <i> me.</i>

22:17.322 --> 22:20.333
Gene Kelly had the hots for
grandma. I'm not kidding.

22:20.358 --> 22:23.493
And apparently, it was her legs
that sent him over the edge.

22:23.528 --> 22:24.760
Hey. The woman had great gams.

22:24.796 --> 22:26.095
- I'll drink to that.
- Woman had great gams.

22:26.130 --> 22:27.630
Well, you're a good grandson,

22:27.665 --> 22:29.799
keeping your grandma's tall tales alive.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.106
Thank you.

22:31.131 --> 22:33.834
Now, tell me... what's
going on with you two? Hm?

22:33.859 --> 22:35.278
Do you have a new date set yet?

22:35.303 --> 22:36.402
Uh...

22:36.474 --> 22:38.508
Y... n... do... We don't have a date yet.

22:38.543 --> 22:40.643
We're, you know, working
it out, working through it.

22:40.678 --> 22:42.445
Well, don't wait too long.

22:42.514 --> 22:44.881
We need something happy to look forward to.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.449
Yeah, no, I understand. I understand.

22:46.484 --> 22:48.482
I was actually sort of kicking
around the idea of a fall wedding.

22:48.507 --> 22:50.474
You know, it'd give us time
to plan for it and everything.

22:50.509 --> 22:52.181
What do you think about that, babe?

22:52.206 --> 22:53.538
Uh... [Clears throat]

22:53.563 --> 22:54.881
You know what? Can I just... sorry.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.005
Can I just talk to you for a second?

22:56.030 --> 22:57.196
Yeah. Of course.

22:57.283 --> 22:59.304
Pardon us, Aunt D. Okay.

22:59.591 --> 23:00.757
[Sighs]

23:00.782 --> 23:02.148
I just... I'm...

23:02.173 --> 23:04.805
I'm not sure that we need to be
talking about another wedding,

23:04.852 --> 23:06.152
especially around all these people.

23:06.187 --> 23:07.887
- Well, it's just my family, you know?
- No, I know.

23:07.922 --> 23:09.789
Obviously, it doesn't have
to be in the fall, sweetheart.

23:09.824 --> 23:12.391
I know. I just... I... Scott, I just...

23:12.427 --> 23:14.326
I don't know if we
should be getting married.

23:14.362 --> 23:16.486
We still have to talk
about everything and...

23:16.511 --> 23:17.640
- I know.
- Okay.

23:17.665 --> 23:19.365
I know we have to talk, and we will.

23:20.959 --> 23:22.535
Babe...

23:22.570 --> 23:24.069
I think you just got scared.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.672
And I think that's normal.
<i>I</i> got scared, too.

23:26.707 --> 23:29.775
You know, marriage is... it's
a terrifying concept, right?

23:29.811 --> 23:31.377
Plus, you know, we haven't
been together that long

23:31.412 --> 23:32.411
in the grand scheme of things,

23:32.447 --> 23:34.246
so if a long engagement would help...

23:34.282 --> 23:36.048
I was with Harry.

23:40.262 --> 23:41.292
When?

23:46.746 --> 23:47.957
Okay.

23:50.518 --> 23:52.447
Well, yeah, I really think you should go.

23:52.472 --> 23:53.557
I'm so sorry.

23:53.582 --> 23:55.115
And I think you should get, uh...

23:56.610 --> 23:59.157
Get your things packed and
get out of my house tonight.

Hey. Thanks for coming.

24:24.938 --> 24:26.437
No problem.

24:27.507 --> 24:31.643
So, is Lucy ready to
meet her little brother?

24:37.618 --> 24:40.062
Scotty, you've gotten so tall.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.354
Thank you.

24:41.379 --> 24:44.281
He got this new game,
and he's totally obsessed.

24:44.306 --> 24:45.674
You know how that goes.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.921
[Sighs] I do.

24:46.946 --> 24:48.612
I can never get Lucy off the iPad.

24:48.648 --> 24:50.147
She has an iPad?

24:50.183 --> 24:53.732
Technically, it's <i> my</i> iPad,
but she uses it more than I do.

24:53.757 --> 24:55.089
How <i> is</i> Lucy?

24:55.125 --> 24:56.692
Okay.

24:57.227 --> 24:58.753
It's been difficult.

24:58.871 --> 25:01.406
This whole thing has
got her pretty rattled.

25:01.431 --> 25:03.398
So, you finally told her the truth?

25:03.433 --> 25:05.300
Oh, it came out.

25:05.335 --> 25:06.934
So now she knows everything.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.612
Everything, huh? Well, how'd that go?

25:09.637 --> 25:12.808
Like I said, it's been... difficult.

25:13.810 --> 25:16.611
I got to pee, and the toilet
in the R.V. is still busted.

25:16.646 --> 25:18.900
[Chuckling] April, this
is my brother, Marc.

25:18.925 --> 25:20.740
Marc, this is April.

25:20.765 --> 25:21.964
Hey. Nice to meet you.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.732
Uh, do you mind if I use your John?

25:24.602 --> 25:25.744
Yeah.

25:31.142 --> 25:32.538
[Sighs]

25:32.563 --> 25:34.197
[Knock on door]

25:37.181 --> 25:39.415
- Hm.
- I heard that you told Scott?

25:39.450 --> 25:40.516
Yeah.

25:40.551 --> 25:42.551
Was not awesome, but it had to be done.

25:42.586 --> 25:44.486
And then I spent the night at Savi's,

25:44.522 --> 25:46.889
waiting for her to come
home, which she did not.

25:46.924 --> 25:49.768
Would you mind if I crashed here
for a while until I find a place?

25:49.793 --> 25:51.727
Of course not. Stay as long as you need.

25:51.762 --> 25:53.762
- Come on in.
- Thank you, honey.

25:54.799 --> 25:56.465
You seem better.

25:56.500 --> 25:59.248
I <i> am</i> better,
actually, despite the fact

25:59.273 --> 26:02.413
that I'm homeless, jobless,
sisterless, carless...

26:02.438 --> 26:03.779
You lost the Tesla?

26:03.804 --> 26:04.858
Oh, yeah.

26:04.883 --> 26:06.616
The fallout of this particular jilting

26:06.641 --> 26:08.381
has been fairly epic.

26:08.546 --> 26:11.046
That said, you know
what? I'm on an upswing.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.905
Because for once in my life,
Karen, I did the right thing.

26:13.930 --> 26:15.212
Telling Scott the truth

26:15.237 --> 26:16.837
was absolutely the right thing to do.

26:16.862 --> 26:19.232
And you know what... I
know that Savi is pissed,

26:19.257 --> 26:21.551
but she'll... She'll come around.

26:21.591 --> 26:24.959
I-it's not like she was still
in love with Harry or anything.

26:27.728 --> 26:29.163
Well...

26:29.198 --> 26:30.664
You... You better tell me.

26:33.202 --> 26:35.069
Savi was still in love with Harry.

26:35.104 --> 26:37.538
What are you talking about?

26:37.573 --> 26:40.007
To be fair, it was a
pretty recent revelation.

26:40.043 --> 26:41.709
She just figured it out herself

26:41.744 --> 26:43.711
after she thought she was going
to die on the motorcycle...

26:43.746 --> 26:45.312
Whoa, whoa. Now you're just saying words.

26:45.348 --> 26:46.647
What are you talking about, Karen?

26:46.682 --> 26:49.050
She was going to tell you after the party.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.619
She didn't want to take
anything away from your weekend.

26:51.654 --> 26:54.142
Oh, my God! That's what
she was gonna tell me!

26:54.167 --> 26:56.033
Karen, I swear to God, I
thought she was gonna say

26:56.068 --> 26:57.742
that she was pregnant again or something.

26:58.771 --> 27:01.906
I have to go, but we can talk
about this all night, okay?

27:01.941 --> 27:03.040
Oh, my...

Hi, Dr. Adams.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.185
Couple of ground rules.

27:49.062 --> 27:51.395
Number 1... you're a colleague
that works at the hospital.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.552
That's how we met.

27:52.587 --> 27:54.788
I'd appreciate it if
you adjusted your tone...

27:54.823 --> 27:55.955
Especially since I'm the one

27:55.991 --> 27:58.058
who's considering
doing <i> you</i> the favor.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.492
I'll kiss your ass all day long

27:59.528 --> 28:01.561
if you decide my wife
is worthy of being saved.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.430
Until then, I'm not getting Viv's hopes up.

28:03.465 --> 28:04.764
She's been through enough.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.612
So, do what you have to
do, but keep it brief.

28:07.637 --> 28:09.970
I think this was a mistake.

You home is beautiful.

Thank you.

28:28.849 --> 28:31.150
So, how do you know Alec?

28:31.185 --> 28:33.652
Karen works part time in, uh, E.R.

28:33.687 --> 28:35.921
She just closed her psychiatric practice

28:35.956 --> 28:37.923
and is considering opening
a new one in the towers.

28:38.104 --> 28:40.248
- So you'd be neighbors.
- Exactly.

28:40.273 --> 28:41.539
That's fun.

You will not believe what
this guy can do with quinoa.

28:48.045 --> 28:50.246
I had no idea you cooked, Doctor.

28:50.404 --> 28:51.458
Alec.

28:51.962 --> 28:53.228

- I'm sorry.

29:00.493 --> 29:02.270

this for another time.

food to go to waste.

Is that weird?

29:11.004 --> 29:13.871

29:26.330 --> 29:27.863
Did you say sparkling?

29:27.888 --> 29:29.254
I'm fine with either.

29:29.279 --> 29:31.228
Or maybe you'd prefer
to have a glass of wine?

29:31.253 --> 29:33.195
I mean, just because
<i>I'm</i> not supposed to drink

29:33.220 --> 29:35.153
doesn't mean other people can't.

29:35.178 --> 29:36.511
You don't drink?

29:36.536 --> 29:40.991
Well, not really supposed
to because of my condition.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.366
What condition is that?

29:44.265 --> 29:46.208
I'm dying, Karen.

29:47.069 --> 29:49.103
But you already knew that, didn't you?

29:53.361 --> 29:55.028
If you could just give
me an address, ma'am,

29:55.063 --> 29:56.329
I can plug it into Waze...

29:56.364 --> 29:58.837
- I don't have an address, Ahmed.
- So where are we going?

29:58.862 --> 30:00.828
We're going to find my sister. What time...

30:00.853 --> 30:02.953
Okay, it's 1:00, so she's
probably eating, right?

30:02.978 --> 30:04.444
So let's just start at Sunset Plaza.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.102
She's a huge fan of the
pizza at Café Med...

30:06.127 --> 30:07.428
- Miss...
- Oh! Wait!

30:07.453 --> 30:08.852
What's the name of that place

30:08.877 --> 30:10.577
that opened in Silverlake... Forage?

30:10.602 --> 30:13.015
I think she likes the salmon
there if she's in a low-carb mood.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.375
So, basically, you just want me
to drive you around Los Angeles.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.800
Yeah. It's my dime.

30:16.825 --> 30:18.325
You realize this is a huge city.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.383
The odds of finding one
person are near impossible.

30:20.408 --> 30:22.868
- Holy crap!
- [Tires screech]

30:22.893 --> 30:24.259
Holy crap! That's her car!

30:24.284 --> 30:25.683
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

30:25.708 --> 30:28.119
Savi! Savi!

30:29.802 --> 30:32.239
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no, no! Savi!

30:32.264 --> 30:33.614
- [Horns honking]
- Savi, please, please, please.

30:33.639 --> 30:36.006
I love you! Please talk to me!

30:36.041 --> 30:37.610
Hey, Joss.

30:38.377 --> 30:40.070
W-where's Savi?

30:40.095 --> 30:41.595
What the hell are you doing
driving my sister's car?

30:41.630 --> 30:42.762
She gave it to me

30:42.798 --> 30:44.865
after I dropped her off at
the airport this morning.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.133
The airport? Where is she going?

30:47.169 --> 30:49.035
I have no idea.

30:49.071 --> 30:51.638
Even if I did, I...
wouldn't tell <i> you.</i>

30:52.078 --> 30:54.012
[Scoffs] Okay, look.

30:54.037 --> 30:55.970
I don't... I don't even
remember your frickin' name.

30:56.006 --> 30:57.450
- It's Zack.
- Right... Zack.

30:57.475 --> 30:59.284
Listen to me, please...
This is a family situation,

30:59.309 --> 31:01.843
so if you know where my sister
is, I need you to tell me.

31:01.878 --> 31:02.977
[Sighs]

31:03.013 --> 31:05.813
All I know is that your
sister seemed pretty upset.

31:05.849 --> 31:08.816
If I were you, I would give her some space.

31:08.852 --> 31:09.884
[Horns blaring]

31:14.691 --> 31:17.982
The truth is, I never
planned on buying the R.V.

31:18.007 --> 31:19.039
I wanted a Camry...

31:19.074 --> 31:20.980
You know, sensible car, good mileage.

31:21.005 --> 31:22.371
Then I got to a lot,

31:22.396 --> 31:24.129
and the first thing I see... Brandy.

31:24.154 --> 31:26.090
- That's her name.
- Whose name?

31:26.115 --> 31:27.814
- My R.V.
- You guys named it?

31:27.850 --> 31:29.716
You got to name an R.V. It's like a boat.

31:29.752 --> 31:30.784
You guys have a boat?

31:30.819 --> 31:32.185
No. I don't even have an iPad.

31:32.221 --> 31:33.954
Oh, Scotty, don't start.

31:33.989 --> 31:36.423
Anyway, so... Brandy's
sitting there, right,

31:36.458 --> 31:39.247
giving me this real '70s vibe,

31:39.272 --> 31:41.138
and I just knew I had to have her.

31:41.174 --> 31:42.673
And good thing, too... Came in real handy

31:42.709 --> 31:44.875
when Miranda and the kid
needed a place to hide out

31:44.911 --> 31:46.344
during that whole Olivos thing.

31:47.714 --> 31:49.447
A story for another time.

31:49.482 --> 31:51.115
- Anyone need a refill?
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:51.150 --> 31:52.550
So, you all live in a car?

31:52.585 --> 31:54.785
Yep. Kind of like the Partridge family.

31:54.821 --> 31:56.020
Who are they?

31:56.055 --> 31:58.122
They are a fictional family
from a television sitcom

31:58.157 --> 31:59.890
starring Shirley Jones and David Cassidy

31:59.926 --> 32:03.227
about a family/rock band
who drive across the country

32:03.262 --> 32:04.862
in this crazy-looking bus.

32:05.511 --> 32:07.398
- It's pretty dope.
- Is it a magic bus?

32:07.433 --> 32:09.400
Well, it depends on your
definition of "magic."

32:09.435 --> 32:11.168
Did the exceptionally attractive family

32:11.204 --> 32:12.370
make magical music together?

32:12.663 --> 32:14.691
[Chuckling] Why, yes, they did.

32:14.716 --> 32:15.782
Can the bus fly?

32:15.817 --> 32:17.109
It cannot.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.562
The magic school bus can fly.

32:18.587 --> 32:21.238
- I love the magic school bus.
- [Chuckles] Me too.

32:23.325 --> 32:25.063
Would you like some more mac and cheese?

32:25.088 --> 32:26.443
Yes, please.

32:29.064 --> 32:30.930
You look a lot like my dad.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.028
Karen: Thank you.

32:39.882 --> 32:43.076
Have you spoken to anyone
since the diagnosis?

32:43.591 --> 32:45.191
Other than your husband, I mean.

32:45.216 --> 32:47.216
Oh, I went to a few
groups in the beginning.

32:47.251 --> 32:48.618
Alec thought it would help,

32:48.653 --> 32:52.785
but honestly, most of the
people in there were so depressed

32:52.810 --> 32:54.566
it was kind of making me feel worse.

32:54.591 --> 32:56.024
That can happen sometimes.

32:56.049 --> 32:58.517
But I have a great
support group in my family.

32:58.542 --> 32:59.908
My parents are here.

32:59.933 --> 33:03.201
I have loads of nieces
and nephews, who I adore,

33:03.226 --> 33:04.651
a job I love.

33:04.676 --> 33:06.877
I'm telling you... apart
from having a fatal disease,

33:06.902 --> 33:08.502
my life kicks ass.

33:08.527 --> 33:09.860
[Laughs]

33:09.885 --> 33:11.385
So, am <i> I</i> allowed to ask a question,

33:11.410 --> 33:12.676
or is this a one-way street?

33:12.897 --> 33:14.196
Of course.

33:14.232 --> 33:15.898
What's in it for <i> you?</i>

33:17.502 --> 33:18.868
I'm sorry. That sounded rude.

33:18.903 --> 33:20.436
That's... That's not what I meant.

33:20.471 --> 33:22.335
- No, it didn't.
- No, it's just...

33:23.107 --> 33:24.672
You don't know me.

33:26.362 --> 33:28.095
Why would you do this for me?

33:29.247 --> 33:33.449
The past two years have been... difficult.

33:33.632 --> 33:35.432
I've lost a lot.

33:37.155 --> 33:41.223
And I feel like I'm at
a crossroads in my life.

33:43.741 --> 33:47.342
I want to be of use. I want
to believe in something.

33:49.856 --> 33:52.331
Your husband thinks he found me,

33:52.503 --> 33:54.826
but I wonder if it's possible...

33:55.640 --> 33:57.432
Maybe <i> I</i> found <i> you.</i>

33:57.457 --> 33:59.890
[Sighs]

34:02.046 --> 34:05.065
<i>The number you have dialed
has been disconnected</i>

34:05.090 --> 34:06.547
<i>Or is no longer in service.</i>

34:06.711 --> 34:08.710
[Sniffles]

34:10.293 --> 34:12.460
[Thunder rumbles]

34:14.433 --> 34:16.099
[Sniffles]

34:16.135 --> 34:17.801
[Sighs]

34:19.838 --> 34:21.726
Hey. It's me.

34:22.641 --> 34:23.672
[Sighs]

34:23.708 --> 34:25.242
Can I come over?

34:25.277 --> 34:27.110
[Thunder crashes]

34:31.850 --> 34:34.083
[Breathes deeply]

34:46.297 --> 34:47.597
[Engine shuts off]

34:47.632 --> 34:48.998
[Truck door opens]

34:49.034 --> 34:50.534
[Thunder rumbles]

34:56.742 --> 34:59.706
We gonna do this outside,
or you want to come in?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.731
You're gonna invite me in?
You're always so polite, right?

35:01.766 --> 35:02.865
You know what I think?

35:03.464 --> 35:05.631
I think it's that accent that you got.

35:05.656 --> 35:07.723
I think it makes you sound charming.

35:07.758 --> 35:10.413
Even when you're screwing another
man's wife on his wedding day.

35:10.438 --> 35:12.238
[Thunder rumbles]

35:12.596 --> 35:13.929
How was she, by the way?

35:13.964 --> 35:15.264
I wanted to ask you how she was.

35:15.299 --> 35:17.494
Was she, uh, everything
you thought she'd be?

35:17.519 --> 35:19.152
Pretty good, right? Flexible?

35:19.177 --> 35:21.210
Yeah, why don't you go
home, Scott? Sober up.

35:21.235 --> 35:22.768
We can do this another time.

35:22.793 --> 35:24.325
I knew that you were gonna be trouble.

35:24.350 --> 35:28.085
Always hanging out in that...
That stupid goofy chef costume.

35:28.512 --> 35:30.279
Then I thought, "you know what?

35:30.314 --> 35:31.713
He's no trouble at all.

35:31.749 --> 35:34.583
Joss is too smart for this.
She knows the guy's a loser."

35:35.431 --> 35:37.619
It's obvious... Even to your wife.

35:37.655 --> 35:40.469
That's the thing about instincts, right?

35:41.659 --> 35:43.125
You should always trust them.

35:47.631 --> 35:49.264
[Thunder crashes]

35:49.547 --> 35:51.367
What the hell's the matter with you, huh?

35:51.392 --> 35:52.701
What's the matter with you?

35:52.736 --> 35:55.170
You too good to fight back? Huh?

35:58.382 --> 35:59.515
[Coughs]

35:59.551 --> 36:01.418
You can keep that two-timing bitch.

36:02.234 --> 36:03.834
You two deserve each other.

36:09.662 --> 36:12.274
Thank you for coming. We
should do this again soon.

36:12.299 --> 36:15.121
Yeah. I-it might be a while.

36:15.146 --> 36:17.746
I'm gonna start a new job next week.

36:17.782 --> 36:20.428
I'm gonna be working on a
cruise ship for three months.

36:20.530 --> 36:21.896
- Really?
- Blackjack dealer.

36:21.931 --> 36:24.198
It's the most money I can make
without taking off my clothes.

36:24.233 --> 36:26.200
[Laughs] I'm kidding... sort of.

36:26.269 --> 36:28.269
Yeah, see, but when <i> I</i> make
stripper jokes, you get all mad.

36:28.304 --> 36:29.540
Get out.

36:29.565 --> 36:31.265
[Clears throat]

36:31.454 --> 36:33.008
Is Scotty going with you?

36:33.033 --> 36:35.567
Marc's gonna take care
of him while I'm gone.

36:35.678 --> 36:37.912
Gonna be an adventure, right, cookie?

36:38.981 --> 36:40.648
Where are you guys gonna live?

36:40.683 --> 36:42.364
The world is our oyster.

36:42.389 --> 36:44.155
That's what so cool about R.V. living...

36:44.190 --> 36:45.656
We can go anywhere, do anything.

36:45.692 --> 36:48.586
That sounds... Very exciting.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.506
Why don't you guys stay here in L.A.?

36:51.531 --> 36:53.464
There's lots of good schools, and that way,

36:53.500 --> 36:55.700
me and Scotty can see each
other whenever we want.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.770
There's no reason why you
can't stay here, I guess.

36:58.805 --> 37:00.671
I could get into some socal living.

37:00.707 --> 37:02.407
[Laughs] Yeah, why not?

37:02.442 --> 37:04.442
April can give me pointers
on the whole parenting thing.

37:04.484 --> 37:06.123
And it takes a village, right?

37:06.148 --> 37:08.776
And I'm totally down for the
whole weekly dinner thing.

37:08.801 --> 37:11.404
W-weekly... That may be a bit much.

37:11.429 --> 37:12.561
Or not.

37:13.906 --> 37:16.106
Hey, whatever works.

37:16.141 --> 37:18.308
Aw, it's gonna be so fun!

37:18.344 --> 37:20.577
- [Laughter]
- All right!

37:20.613 --> 37:23.828
I'm not going no place,
right? We're staying here.

37:31.358 --> 37:33.525
Oh, my God. What happened?

37:34.542 --> 37:36.475
- No.
- It's okay.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.466
[Sighs]

37:38.502 --> 37:39.567
Harry, he came here?

37:39.603 --> 37:40.835
It's okay, Joss.

37:40.871 --> 37:43.252
No, it's not okay. You don't
just get violent with people.

37:43.277 --> 37:45.240
- Look at your face.
- Listen to me. Listen. Hey.

37:45.275 --> 37:47.275
I've been on the other
side of this fight before.

37:47.969 --> 37:50.561
Sometimes, these things have to be done.

37:51.481 --> 37:52.737
I'm all right.

37:56.880 --> 37:58.553
- It's okay.
- [Sighs]

37:58.588 --> 37:59.821
Hey.

37:59.856 --> 38:01.523
[Voice breaking] Everything's broken.

38:01.558 --> 38:03.525
Oh, no. Come on. I know it seems that way.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.309
No. What we did... it was...

38:05.505 --> 38:07.529
It was wrong, the way it all happened.

38:07.564 --> 38:09.064
The way...

38:09.818 --> 38:12.118
This really can't be how our story begins.

38:12.684 --> 38:15.417
W-w-what are you saying, Joss?

38:17.291 --> 38:19.007
Listen to me.

38:19.863 --> 38:21.563
I love you.

38:21.921 --> 38:25.149
I have loved you for so long.

38:25.569 --> 38:28.036
I don't even know when it started.

38:28.071 --> 38:29.905
But I know that it's real.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.907
And I know that I'm gonna be with you,

38:31.942 --> 38:34.519
but not right now... Not like this.

38:35.779 --> 38:36.811
Okay?

38:39.516 --> 38:41.082
Please.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.721
[Sighs]

38:49.544 --> 38:51.051
I ruined everything, didn't I?

38:51.076 --> 38:52.569
You did not ruin everything.

38:52.594 --> 38:54.999
You made... A bold choice.

38:55.024 --> 38:56.524
[Snickers]

38:56.984 --> 38:59.864
Ladies, seriously, I love you so much.

38:59.889 --> 39:02.154
And if you want to kick me to
the curb, I completely understand.

39:02.179 --> 39:03.587
Oh, woman, please.

39:03.622 --> 39:06.456
People in glass houses do not throw stones.

39:06.491 --> 39:07.924
Especially at their best friends.

39:08.887 --> 39:10.260
Seriously... You don't hate me?

39:10.295 --> 39:11.761
Of course we don't hate you.

39:11.797 --> 39:13.129
We might judge you a little.

39:13.165 --> 39:14.631
Okay, Karen.

39:14.666 --> 39:18.770
But a wise man once told me,
"you can't help who you love."

39:18.795 --> 39:20.728
- Which wise man was that?
- Ben.

39:20.763 --> 39:22.496
Which one was Ben, again?

39:22.532 --> 39:25.124
- The one who slept with the hookers.
- Oh, right.

39:25.149 --> 39:26.448
I thought that he was the married guy

39:26.483 --> 39:27.582
whose wife tried to kill you.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.551
- That was Tom.
- Right!

39:29.586 --> 39:31.787
Tom, Ben... Very similar.

39:31.812 --> 39:33.335
- It's an easy mistake.
- Mm.

39:34.892 --> 39:36.692
I think we make bad choices.

39:36.727 --> 39:38.249
I'm feeling the same thing.

39:39.029 --> 39:41.563
I think I'm gonna take a
break from dating for a while.

39:41.598 --> 39:43.265
Mm. Me too.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.399
Me three.

39:44.435 --> 39:45.801
[Chuckles]

39:45.836 --> 39:47.069
But wait, wait, wait.

39:47.104 --> 39:49.838
Does that mean, like, a
break from sex or just dating?

39:49.873 --> 39:50.939
[Scoffs]

39:50.974 --> 39:54.536
- [Laughter]
- Kidding. I'm obviously kidding.

39:54.561 --> 39:56.362
[Chuckles]

39:56.980 --> 39:58.855
Hm. [Sighs]

40:00.775 --> 40:02.561
Guys, what if she doesn't come back?

40:02.586 --> 40:04.486
Of course she's coming back.

40:07.402 --> 40:09.502
What if she doesn't?

40:10.593 --> 40:12.826
We just have to trust

40:12.851 --> 40:15.618
that the universe will find
a way to balance itself out.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.323
One way or another.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.253
Hi, there... Melissa.

40:39.278 --> 40:41.345
Yes. Hi. Can I help you?

40:41.381 --> 40:42.813
Uh, I hope so.

40:42.849 --> 40:44.025
Um...

40:44.984 --> 40:46.384
Do you know who I am?

40:46.419 --> 40:48.486
You're Calista Raines.

40:48.521 --> 40:50.054
Fantastic.

40:50.089 --> 40:51.589
So you know who my husband is?

40:52.669 --> 40:54.027
I think so, yes.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.986
Great. Can you tell me what room he's in?

40:56.011 --> 40:58.411
Um... I don't think I can do that.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.165
But he <i> is</i> here, right?

41:02.703 --> 41:04.213
With a woman?

41:07.774 --> 41:10.636
Have you ever been cheated on, Melissa?

41:10.661 --> 41:12.286
Of course you have.

41:13.027 --> 41:14.812
Even if you don't know it.

41:15.428 --> 41:17.462
That's the thing about men.

41:17.497 --> 41:21.966
They cheat, they lie, and they steal.

41:22.002 --> 41:25.570
And they count on us to betray each other.

41:25.605 --> 41:27.572
And we do it, don't we? We do it.

41:27.607 --> 41:30.108
We do it every single time.

41:30.143 --> 41:32.275
But not tonight, Melissa.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.546
Tonight, you and I are sisters in arms.

41:35.582 --> 41:38.116
Tonight, I'm giving you the opportunity

41:38.761 --> 41:40.227
to do the right thing.

41:40.731 --> 41:42.064
And...

41:42.089 --> 41:43.962
I'm also giving you <i> this.</i>

41:46.735 --> 41:47.901
So...

41:48.881 --> 41:51.595
Gonna help me catch the bastard or what?

41:51.884 --> 42:02.013
