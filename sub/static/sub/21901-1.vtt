00:16.976 --> 00:19.270
I'm calling about the summer job.

00:19.353 --> 00:25.276
<i>I see. They're all gone.
Better luck next summer. Bye.</i>

00:27.778 --> 00:31.699
<i>How about a cash counter job?
- I</i> think <i>I'd</i> learn <i>that.</i>

00:31.782 --> 00:37.747
<i>You don't have much experience.
But thanks for calling.</i>

00:38.831 --> 00:44.086
<i>Let's think about it
again next summer.</i>

00:45.463 --> 00:50.342
<i>How old</i> are <i>you?</i>
- Seventeen. Eighteen this fall.

00:50.426 --> 00:55.514
<i>OK. What's your name?</i>
- Kamal <i>Obonye.</i>

00:55.598 --> 00:57.516
O-B-O...

00:57.600 --> 01:01.103
<i>I got it. Thanks.</i>

01:02.021 --> 01:03.689
Hello?

01:04.190 --> 01:06.484
Hello?

01:14.408 --> 01:18.370
Are you sure you want to
start with four districts?

01:18.454 --> 01:21.624
Usually people take one or two.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.335
Can't I get more papers?

01:24.835 --> 01:27.421
Deal with those first.

01:30.341 --> 01:34.762
This area has 340 homes. Stairways
with elevators. And without.

01:34.845 --> 01:41.811
Twice a week. One area
equals about 17 per box.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.897
Knock yourself out.

01:51.987 --> 01:57.451
UNEXPECTED JOURNEY

02:25.271 --> 02:30.359
Abdi, dinner!
- That's my mom.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.570
See ya.

02:33.571 --> 02:37.700
Everytime someone calls Abdi,
all Somalis turn their heads.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.996
Why didn't my parents come up
with a better name?

02:42.079 --> 02:47.334
Gotta go. Later.
- Later.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.756
Hey, Abdi.
- Yeah?

02:53.757 --> 02:57.636
Are you going to tell my mom
what I told you?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.930
Do you have the money?

03:02.266 --> 03:07.021
Trip summary
One way only. 552,50

03:07.104 --> 03:11.192
Kamal. In two clays we're moving
to your stepfather's place -

03:11.275 --> 03:15.154
and you haven't
even started packing.

03:20.910 --> 03:26.665
Are you not going to speak to me and
your mom for the rest of your life?

03:36.217 --> 03:39.678
It's not my fault his clad took off.
- Just leave him be.

03:39.762 --> 03:43.641
Someone should show him
a male example.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.401
Hey!

03:54.860 --> 03:59.031
Could you pass the ball?
- I could.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.785
Fucking old fart!

04:37.236 --> 04:40.072
Do you know how to read?

04:42.658 --> 04:45.786
Do you need any help?

04:45.869 --> 04:48.706
Can you pick my lock?

04:49.248 --> 04:53.752
Give me a break!
No harder than stealing a car.

04:53.836 --> 04:57.506
My tax money's supposed
to support old-timers like you?

04:57.589 --> 05:03.012
Hey, Somali! You're not
leaving me like this, are you?

05:03.095 --> 05:05.723
I'm not paying those swindlers
for opening the door.

05:05.806 --> 05:11.186
We used to have a janitor. Ringing
his doorbell fixed everything.

05:11.520 --> 05:18.027
There's a twenty in here for you.
Twenty-five! That's my last offer.

05:37.588 --> 05:41.300
This is what happens when
you leave your balcony open.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.011
Somalis keep climbing in.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.898
You owe me five.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.651
You have to have cash.
You can't trust the banks anymore.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.571
They hide their money in Panama.

06:10.371 --> 06:13.707
Finnish salami.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.210
Full milk. Local.

06:20.005 --> 06:24.510
You'll get your money back.
When the groceries are here.

06:28.639 --> 06:33.102
What are you waiting for?
Finland qualifying for the games?

07:13.350 --> 07:17.771
Turn down the noise!
- You're the one making noise.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.065
Get a job.
- It's holiday season.

07:20.149 --> 07:25.404
You always have one.
I hate this shitty music.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.031
Come down here to say it.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.253
Are you OK?

08:11.909 --> 08:15.746
Contacts
Dad, home

08:31.553 --> 08:36.725
Kamal! Give us a hand!
- We don't need any help.

08:36.808 --> 08:41.563
Kamal's very handy with these.
We need the car to move out.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.907
I've checked that already.

09:10.092 --> 09:15.138
He's a good man.
I'm serious with him.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.808
<i>We're going to be a family.</i>

09:17.891 --> 09:20.811
If you're not happy with this...

09:22.854 --> 09:25.357
Park the car.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.817
Start the car.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.237
I'm not going back.

10:12.321 --> 10:17.868
Do you know where Finns spend
their Midsummer? At the cabin.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.288
I'll show you the way.

10:22.497 --> 10:27.878
If you're a good driver,
it's four hours there and back.

10:28.253 --> 10:33.675
That's more than you make
in a month with the damn leaflets.

10:33.759 --> 10:38.639
All right.
A hundred more when we get there.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.934
Wait.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.995
One-way trip

13:48.954 --> 13:52.415
Did the cat get your tongue?

13:52.707 --> 13:57.629
Usually you guys babble all the time.

13:58.171 --> 14:02.634
Do you know what's
a good name for you? Speechless.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.764
If there are no objections,
the name stays.

14:08.723 --> 14:12.435
DOUG!

14:39.546 --> 14:43.049
First time out of town?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.896
Hell!

14:55.979 --> 14:59.858
Can't be the first time
you see a man pissing?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.820
Bloody hell.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.869
I think I just shat myself.

15:10.952 --> 15:17.959
Come and help. Take some of
that grass to wipe the shit off.

15:21.171 --> 15:24.424
This is what I'm paying you for.

15:33.099 --> 15:39.773
Really. I was just pulling your leg.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.795
Why are you shaking?

16:43.878 --> 16:48.466
Are you high on doobies
or something? What?

16:51.803 --> 16:54.597
I don't have a licence.
I'm not old enough.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.643
I really need the money. We
got this far. You know I can drive.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.770
Whose car is this?
- Abbasi's.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.523
Who's he?
- Nobody.

17:05.858 --> 17:10.864
I'll tell them you ran away
from the hospital. -Shut up, boy.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.616
I have to get away.
- Where?

17:13.700 --> 17:17.829
Away! -Why the hell do you Somalis
come here if you don't like it?

17:17.912 --> 17:22.000
I'm not from Somalia.
- Don't argue with me!

17:22.083 --> 17:25.837
Next!
- Deal with this.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.321
Let's stick to Finnish.

17:54.240 --> 18:00.789
You handle this.
I asked for the licence.

18:04.584 --> 18:09.422
Can you translate?
We'd like to see the licence.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.382
Why?
"Sorry?

18:11.466 --> 18:14.594
You didn't check the other drivers.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.932
This is about the color of the skin.

18:20.016 --> 18:23.353
I'm not a racist.
- This is harassment.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.563
I'm not harassing anyone!

18:25.647 --> 18:28.066
Do you know who I am?
- No, I don't.

18:28.149 --> 18:32.112
A war veteran.
What did we fight for?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.408
Am I drunk or not?
- Freedom!

18:37.492 --> 18:39.911
No, you're not.

18:39.994 --> 18:44.249
Finland is a free country.
You should think about your attitude.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.877
Okay, go ahead.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.807
You're welcome.
- What?

19:02.934 --> 19:04.978
I was the one saving us!

19:05.061 --> 19:08.898
It was me who dealt with it!
Without me, we'd be stuck.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.068
A real war veteran.

19:12.402 --> 19:16.322
Where did you fight? Student riots?

19:47.520 --> 19:49.731
Do we still have a long way to go?

19:49.814 --> 19:54.068
Just drive.
I'll tell you when we're there.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.155
Sirkka! Sirkka! Wake up!

20:46.704 --> 20:51.542
What's it with you younglings?
Tired all the time.

20:51.626 --> 20:54.337
You just slept for an hour.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.298
I got up at five
to deliver the papers.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.635
But I'm awake now. We can go on.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.554
First we'll have a nap.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.141
Thirty minutes max.

21:07.225 --> 21:11.562
No way. Let's keep going.
- We're not.

21:11.646 --> 21:14.274
Shut-eye time.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.420
What the hell?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.715
Old-timer!

21:40.133 --> 21:42.427
PODs!

21:44.053 --> 21:47.765
Slippers! What's his name again?

22:17.170 --> 22:19.672
Old man!

22:20.965 --> 22:23.801
Slipper man!

22:54.832 --> 22:59.253
Football European Championships
Big screen here

23:03.633 --> 23:07.929
Really! You just can't
walk away like that.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.766
Was Speechless worried?
- Not at all.

23:11.849 --> 23:16.270
Let's go. Neither of us wants this
to go on any longer than necessary.

23:16.354 --> 23:20.108
We can watch the game
to the end, can't we? -No.

23:20.191 --> 23:23.611
Don't you like football?
- It's not about that.

23:23.694 --> 23:27.156
Be quiet now.
We can't hear the game.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.158
"Could you please be quiet?"

23:29.242 --> 23:32.995
What?
- Why is it so hard to try to behave?

23:34.914 --> 23:38.709
Is this your personal immigrant boy?
An asylum seeker?

23:38.793 --> 23:42.004
Do you know where Helsinki is?
- I wasn't speaking to you.

23:42.088 --> 23:46.008
<i>Ramâ€œ No one here
wants to hear that.</i>

24:01.732 --> 24:05.778
I thought we were going.
- Drink up your beer.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.041
Don't drop your eyes.

24:19.125 --> 24:24.964
Is that a tribal thing?
That you can't talk to pretty girls.

24:25.047 --> 24:29.510
Is that your personal thing?
That you have to be an idiot.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.016
You're staring at her.

24:35.975 --> 24:41.439
So what? -Stop it. You walk
in here and take our women.

24:41.522 --> 24:45.651
Rami! You have no women in here.
- You're not welcome here.

24:45.735 --> 24:50.239
Go back to your seat.
You've drunk to much.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.658
Go and sleep it off.
- I'm not tired.

24:52.742 --> 24:58.122
Could you be quiet?
The King is on TV.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.920
Can I get your number?

25:04.003 --> 25:06.088
A clever time to make a move.
- Can I?

25:06.172 --> 25:09.967
Someone here will get hurt soon.
Pull the trigger, kill the nigger.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.637
A bad joke.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.976
Look at that goal! Awesome!

25:23.981 --> 25:26.067
Fucking monkey!

25:30.154 --> 25:32.365
Step aside.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.962
Was that the biggest rock
you could find?

25:48.339 --> 25:51.300
Where's your jacket?

25:53.970 --> 25:58.891
Shit. My passport.
- Passport?

25:58.975 --> 26:02.770
Did you take it with you?
Let's turn back.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.773
We can't do that.
The dude will kill me.

26:08.192 --> 26:12.446
Mommy.
- Put that down.

26:16.617 --> 26:21.247
"Where are you? Mommy."
- Tell her I'm with Abdi.

26:21.330 --> 26:27.920
Are you going to lie to her?
"I have your hoodie."

26:28.004 --> 26:30.548
Give me that!
-"Noora."

26:31.048 --> 26:33.467
Slow down!

26:38.973 --> 26:43.436
Oops.
- Are you OK?

26:56.407 --> 27:01.412
Abbasi's shitty car. Piece of junk.

27:02.955 --> 27:07.877
Fucking typical. That he'd have
a second-hand family car.

27:09.754 --> 27:14.216
He got his family second-hand, too.
- Why are you kicking the car?

27:14.300 --> 27:17.386
It was you who hit the trees.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.899
OK. Let's go.

27:30.941 --> 27:33.819
Let's go back to get your jacket.

27:34.904 --> 27:39.158
Call the girl.
- Guess how long the battery lasts?

27:40.201 --> 27:42.745
I'll never get out of here.

27:53.005 --> 27:59.220
Let's take a shortcut.
We're no more than 15 minutes away.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.306
We're almost there.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.319
Why didn't you take proper clothes?

28:16.487 --> 28:20.241
I didn't know we'd be
trekking in deep woods.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.077
Let's go back to the road.

28:23.160 --> 28:27.748
The moss on the tree -

28:27.832 --> 28:31.168
tells you where north is.

28:31.252 --> 28:35.506
What are you saying?
- I saw that on a nature program.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.771
Do you see any moss?

28:52.064 --> 28:55.401
No more than 15 minutes away.

28:55.484 --> 28:59.155
The landscape looks the same
than eight hours ago.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.408
Your turn to soak your pants?

29:02.491 --> 29:06.454
Have to have faith. To find the road.

29:06.537 --> 29:08.914
It's the same in life.

29:08.998 --> 29:13.502
Stay on your chosen path, bravely.

29:16.547 --> 29:21.010
What's up? We were supposed
to walk the path of life.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.138
Right now, I can't. My feet hurt.

29:24.221 --> 29:28.434
We can't stay here.
- Do you have any options in mind?

29:33.731 --> 29:37.526
Just put me down.
This is not working.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.744
I'm hungry-

30:26.408 --> 30:29.119
Give me a break.

30:32.957 --> 30:38.003
In Finland the key is usually...
under the carpet.

30:51.976 --> 30:56.564
Is that the only thing you found?
- No.

31:10.452 --> 31:14.290
Do you want some?
- Why not?

31:16.166 --> 31:19.753
Yammy. I've been carrying
these all the time.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.812
Good.

31:36.896 --> 31:41.025
Don't speak with your mouth full.
- Really good.

31:49.909 --> 31:54.747
Lingonberries
Frozen by Sirkka

32:00.252 --> 32:02.671
Is Sirkka your wife?

33:03.983 --> 33:07.027
Hit the sack!

33:07.111 --> 33:09.822
There's only one bed in here.

33:09.905 --> 33:14.201
You'll figure out something.
Improvise.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.835
Bloody hell.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.339
Hi there!

34:51.297 --> 34:56.469
What a face! You thought
a crocodile was attacking you!

34:56.553 --> 34:59.890
I thought you're used
to wildlife in Africa.

34:59.973 --> 35:03.811
I was born in Finland.
- No you were not. You're a Somali.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.313
Jump in!
- No.

35:07.314 --> 35:10.943
Now I know why you're a wimp.
- Why?

35:11.026 --> 35:15.823
If you were born in Africa,
you'd be a tough guy.

35:15.906 --> 35:20.702
You'd be a child soldier.
- Then I would've shot you already.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.690
That's not funny anymore.

36:27.311 --> 36:30.397
No kissing!

36:30.480 --> 36:33.442
What the hell just happened?

36:35.819 --> 36:40.741
Don't know. A little heart problem.
- A little heart problem!

36:40.824 --> 36:44.536
No big deal. Never has been.

36:51.043 --> 36:55.672
No, no.
- What now?

37:06.350 --> 37:08.435
Where...

37:23.992 --> 37:28.121
What's up now? -It's because of you.
My chain is in the lake.

37:28.205 --> 37:31.458
Chain?
- The one my father gave me.

37:31.541 --> 37:36.463
Ask for another one. -How can I? He's
in Nairobi. I'm in the damn woods.

37:36.546 --> 37:39.800
Is that where you're going?
- I'm going that way.

37:39.883 --> 37:45.514
You're going the other way. I hope
we'll never see each other again.

37:56.316 --> 37:59.611
On what side was
the damn moss supposed to be?

37:59.695 --> 38:05.158
You should take the road.
That's the usual way.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.831
Haven't you told your mother?

38:10.914 --> 38:13.792
One more word
and I'll dump you, for sure.

38:13.875 --> 38:17.587
You live with her?
- None of your business.

38:17.671 --> 38:22.509
How have you planned this out?

38:23.677 --> 38:29.057
You've stolen your stepfather's car?

38:30.183 --> 38:34.980
I'll catch you. I bet I will, midget.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.691
Wait a sec. Wait.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.032
What do you want?

38:45.115 --> 38:49.661
Does your father know about this?
- Of course.

38:51.079 --> 38:54.124
When he left, we planned all this.

38:54.916 --> 38:58.128
When did he leave?

38:58.920 --> 39:01.715
When did he leave?

39:02.924 --> 39:05.719
When I was ten.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.723
Oh my goodness.

39:13.101 --> 39:17.981
I have his number.
And we've talked via Messenger.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.652
I know he wants me over there.

39:25.739 --> 39:30.452
You're on your way to Africa.
But you don't have any clothes.

39:30.535 --> 39:34.998
Use the Messenger.
Talk to your Daddy.

39:35.082 --> 39:39.002
My battery's flat.
- Use the land line. Call him.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.004
What do you think?
- Hey!

39:41.088 --> 39:44.549
Sorry! Does anyone have a charger?
- Give me that!

39:44.633 --> 39:47.719
You can't take my phone.

39:47.803 --> 39:51.056
One more word and I'll
yell a Somali is trying to steal.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.476
I'm not a Somali.
- Find a phone.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.104
Or don't you have
the guts to call him?

39:57.187 --> 40:00.148
Whose wedding is this?
- Give me that!

40:07.072 --> 40:09.408
Who's this?

40:12.202 --> 40:15.914
You give me that,
I'll give you this.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.834
God damn it.

40:20.460 --> 40:22.546
Sorry.

40:31.138 --> 40:33.557
What are you doing in there?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.726
What do people
usually do in toilets?

40:36.810 --> 40:39.646
You have a son.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.648
So I have.

40:41.731 --> 40:44.401
Are you going to his wedding?
- No.

40:45.402 --> 40:48.613
A stupid idea. That I'd go there.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.825
And somehow all would be well.

40:52.784 --> 40:57.873
I'm going to the cabin. You just
take care of your own business.

40:58.457 --> 41:01.960
You just can't do that. Not to go.
- Says who?

41:02.043 --> 41:04.963
It's your son's wedding.
I'll get us a ride.

41:05.046 --> 41:09.676
You'll go to the wedding.
Even if I have to carry you. -No way.

41:09.759 --> 41:15.098
You will.
- God damn. Shut the fuck up.

41:15.182 --> 41:18.310
You'll go there. Hang on.

41:34.367 --> 41:37.078
Hey, excuse me.

41:38.288 --> 41:44.044
Do you know a girl with curly hair?
- Yep.

41:44.127 --> 41:48.548
How do you know who I'm talking
about? -Why wouldn't I?

41:49.549 --> 41:53.011
Which way should I go?

41:53.094 --> 41:58.099
Tappara or Ilves?
- I don't follow hockey. Football.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.647
Thanks.

42:38.932 --> 42:42.060
Hi.
- What brings you snooping in here?

42:42.143 --> 42:44.980
I'm not...
- Wait.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.700
Thanks.

43:00.328 --> 43:03.290
Did you think I'd steal your money?
- I did not.

43:03.373 --> 43:07.043
What sort of girl do you think I am?
- What?

43:07.127 --> 43:10.839
Just kidding.
Do you understand? -Maybe.

43:10.922 --> 43:16.761
Where are you going?
- Well, to a wedding.

43:16.845 --> 43:19.723
You need a passport to go there?

43:20.849 --> 43:24.269
Don't you always need one
in the backwoods?

43:31.026 --> 43:34.446
When was the last time
you had a shower?

43:36.781 --> 43:38.700
Come on.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.453
I had a swim this morning!

43:45.081 --> 43:47.751
You can't go to
a wedding in a T-shirt.

43:47.834 --> 43:51.838
My brother's clothes.
If they fit, you can keep them.

43:51.921 --> 43:53.965
Okay. Thanks.

44:01.723 --> 44:04.434
How old are you then?

44:08.605 --> 44:10.315
Eighteen.

44:12.359 --> 44:14.486
An older woman.

44:16.821 --> 44:19.616
Where are you going?
- To the country place.

44:19.699 --> 44:22.118
But you are pretty rural already.

44:24.788 --> 44:27.415
With whom?
- Mom and Dad.

44:28.416 --> 44:31.544
I like them!
Don't you like yours?

44:36.132 --> 44:38.301
Come.

44:41.638 --> 44:44.057
My M-car.
- What?

44:44.140 --> 44:46.559
If you can start it...

45:25.056 --> 45:27.267
You are staring.

45:28.017 --> 45:31.771
Do you know that in Somali
Noora means "light"?

45:31.855 --> 45:34.899
Really? You made that
up right there.

45:34.983 --> 45:37.026
No, really.

45:37.110 --> 45:41.489
But you're not even a Somali.
- No, but Abdi is.

45:43.032 --> 45:48.371
You're a complicated guy.
- And you're a Hillbilly puma.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.880
Look at that.

46:13.229 --> 46:17.233
I'm getting out here.
We can't all fit in here.

46:18.318 --> 46:22.489
Are you giving me your car?
- I'm lending it to you.

46:22.572 --> 46:26.201
I'll come to Helsinki next week.
I can pick it up then.

46:27.577 --> 46:31.873
I might not be there then.
- Oh?

46:40.840 --> 46:45.220
I'm going to my clad.
To Nairobi.

46:49.432 --> 46:52.560
I guess we won't be
seeing each other then.

46:57.565 --> 47:00.068
Cell phone.

47:24.634 --> 47:27.345
You smell of gasoline.

47:30.181 --> 47:33.059
Is there any way we could meet?

47:33.977 --> 47:37.647
Go on now.
Take the old boy to the wedding.

47:43.111 --> 47:46.364
And put the M-car keys in the mail.

48:18.313 --> 48:21.149
It's going to be OK.

48:48.718 --> 48:54.307
You were supposed to change.
- Can you step aside? It's game time.

48:54.390 --> 48:57.143
Now go and put that suit on!

49:01.356 --> 49:03.232
OK, OK.

49:40.395 --> 49:42.105
Could you deliver this?

49:42.188 --> 49:45.650
Why don't you just text him?
- My feet hurt.

49:45.733 --> 49:51.614
After all this, you're too tired to
take a few steps? -Right now I can't.

49:51.698 --> 49:54.993
Help out an old man.

49:55.076 --> 49:57.286
Be so kind.

50:11.634 --> 50:15.513
What the hell?
- There's no letter.

50:15.596 --> 50:20.852
Guess how long it took me to write
that? -Go over there. Talk to him.

50:21.602 --> 50:23.688
Bastard!

50:38.286 --> 50:42.665
One more time,
a big welcome to you all.

50:46.669 --> 50:51.174
I've known the wedding couple
for a long time. Very long.

50:52.425 --> 50:57.221
I'm really proud and honored -

50:57.889 --> 51:03.895
to be the bestman
of a couple like that.

51:03.978 --> 51:07.565
Take the stage, Mika and Peter!

51:37.637 --> 51:41.182
Peter, I love you.

51:47.021 --> 51:52.777
We have a long mutual history.
We lived on the same street...

52:25.393 --> 52:28.104
Does Mika know?
- What?

52:28.187 --> 52:30.439
Does Mika know?

52:32.650 --> 52:35.194
Wait!
- Don't!

52:37.947 --> 52:39.866
Let's go.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.912
Get the hell out of my way.

52:45.746 --> 52:48.583
Hey! Hey!

52:56.048 --> 52:58.301
What is he doing here?

52:58.384 --> 53:03.055
I sort of invited him.
- You did?

53:05.725 --> 53:10.438
Technically
your break-up is my fault.

53:11.939 --> 53:15.776
Don't give yourself too much credit.

53:15.860 --> 53:19.488
Don't be so stubborn.
Go and talk to him.

53:19.572 --> 53:22.575
You're just like him.
- Like hell I am!

53:50.061 --> 53:52.396
Go and talk to him.

54:05.493 --> 54:08.246
You haven't changed a bit.

54:09.205 --> 54:14.460
Why are you here?
I still have the same disease.

54:14.543 --> 54:19.048
I just said
my honest opinion back then.

54:19.131 --> 54:21.050
Honest?

54:21.133 --> 54:25.137
"My son's not gay
or I don't have a son anymore."

54:25.263 --> 54:28.307
I could have expressed
myself differently.

54:28.391 --> 54:31.644
You even disallowed
Mommy to see me.

54:31.727 --> 54:37.775
You were provoking me
with your boyfriends.

54:37.858 --> 54:42.446
And your flirting around.
- It wasn't too hard.

54:42.989 --> 54:47.994
It's part of my disease. Guess what?

54:48.077 --> 54:51.455
Mommy was seeing me
all the time, behind your back.

54:51.539 --> 54:55.293
She didn't listen to you, either.
- I knew it all along.

54:58.587 --> 55:00.840
At her funeral...

55:06.429 --> 55:10.224
...you couldn't even be
in the same room with me.

55:10.516 --> 55:12.893
Not even then.

55:17.690 --> 55:21.027
Have you abandoned him?
- He has.

55:21.110 --> 55:23.738
He has abandoned me.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.907
And who the fuck are you?

55:26.991 --> 55:28.951
A neighbor.

55:29.744 --> 55:32.204
A neighbor!

55:33.456 --> 55:36.667
Stop your arguing.
You're supposed to make up.

55:36.751 --> 55:40.254
Who are you to tell us how
to live our lives, alien boy?

55:40.338 --> 55:42.840
Don't yell to the kid!
- Just like your old man.

55:42.923 --> 55:45.426
What the hell?
- Don't yell to the kid.

55:45.509 --> 55:50.306
Shut up, you scoundrel.
- I don't like when you call me that.

55:50.389 --> 55:52.933
A hell of an idea.
To invite the old man.

55:53.017 --> 55:56.103
Don't swear.
- Why did you force me to come here?

55:56.187 --> 55:59.565
Force! I didn't force you.
You were heading here anyway.

55:59.648 --> 56:05.654
No way! I was going to the cabin.
This doesn't make any sense.

56:06.655 --> 56:10.993
All your fault!
- My fault? That things go wrong?

56:11.077 --> 56:13.662
Well, whose fault is it then?

56:21.712 --> 56:23.881
You're off again?

56:23.964 --> 56:27.843
Nice that you showed up.
Fucked up my wedding!

56:28.552 --> 56:31.472
Inside, all of you! Let's party!

56:33.182 --> 56:35.851
Stop fucking following me.
Go away.

56:35.935 --> 56:37.770
What?

56:38.896 --> 56:42.191
I should've never gone there.
- It was good.

56:42.274 --> 56:44.735
Nothing good about that.

56:44.819 --> 56:49.198
Some things are best
to be left alone.

56:50.491 --> 56:53.285
But he's your son.

56:57.164 --> 57:00.209
Now I have no one left.

57:06.006 --> 57:10.302
I could take him this letter.
- Now, shut up.

57:20.729 --> 57:25.192
Stop here. This is my destination.

57:31.782 --> 57:34.618
What's going on?

57:34.702 --> 57:38.747
Nothing's going on.
You can go home now.

58:18.579 --> 58:25.127
It's worth at least a hundred.
But now you must go. -What?

58:28.130 --> 58:32.635
You were in a rush to Nairobi,
weren't you? Just go.

59:13.092 --> 59:16.804
Now I'm ready.
- What are you doing?

59:16.887 --> 59:19.181
Shh. Shh.

59:20.599 --> 59:22.977
Please don't disturb.

59:26.939 --> 59:31.694
Haven't taken my medication for days.

59:36.198 --> 59:40.744
It should kick in soon.

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:19.867
Oh shit.

01:00:31.337 --> 01:00:34.298
I asked you to leave.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:37.384
Are you trying to kill yourself?
- No.

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:42.806
What are these then?
- Just speeding up the inevitable.

01:00:43.015 --> 01:00:45.934
Are you popping these?
Out-of-date-meds?

01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:49.438
You'll get the shits, that's all.
Give them to me.

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:54.443
Why should you care?
Take the watch and take a hike!

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:59.740
All the same to me.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:05.663
Take the bloody watch.
- No, I won't.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:07.665
Take it!

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:10.250
Do you know what?
You're a loser.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:14.505
You're not even a racist.
Just a lonesome chickenshit.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:20.427
That makes two of us. You don't
even have the guts to call your clad.

01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:26.100
What are you saying? -You're dumping
your mother, just like that.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:30.854
She's taken you this far. -You don't
know anything! I have no one in here.

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:33.273
Do you have someone in Africa?

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:36.485
Have you ever even been there?
- Soon I have!

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:39.321
Call your dad then!

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.535
Don't you have the guts?
- I do!

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:47.246
Believe me.
- You don't have the guts.

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.331
Look at this.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:17.025
I'm sorry.
- Don't.

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:19.570
You don't know anything.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:24.491
You're not up to it.

01:02:26.535 --> 01:02:29.246
I don't care if you drop dead.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:38.213
Stop kidding around. Get up!

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:02.029
Hey! Veikko! Can you hear me?

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:13.165
Veikko, you can't die now.
Not after we just argued.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.676
Valkeakoski Hospital

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:31.350
Help me out! Someone!

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:36.063
Hey! Hey!

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.259
<i>Enquiries.</i>

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:08.345
Can I get the number
of Mika Koskinen?

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.390
<i>I need more information.</i>

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.440
Well, he's gay.
- I <i>see.</i>

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:24.820
That doesn't help much, does it?
- No.

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.615
I'll have all the numbers.

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:32.995
<i>We have 131 listed with that name.
- All of them.</i>

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:36.081
<i>As a text message?
- Yes please.</i>

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.921
Is this the son of Veikko Koskinen?

01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:45.632
Is this the son of Veikko Koskinen?

01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:48.135
Is this the son of Veikko Koskinen?

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.053
Hi...

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:02.065
Hi. Is this the son
of Veikko Koskinen?

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:11.575
<i>Mika.-</i> Is this the son
of Veikko Koskinen?

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:15.454
<i>Who's calling?</i>

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:22.377
It's Kamal. We met at the wedding.

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:35.265
Sorry. I'm looking for... Nothing.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.521
Where is he?

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:48.236
His condition doesn't allow
any surgery. Not even transport.

01:05:48.904 --> 01:05:51.823
I'm sorry I can't be more precise.

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:57.412
But it's only a question of days.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:04.044
I'm really sorry.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.609
We could see him now.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:36.618
Hell of a wedding night.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.133
Come with me.

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:18.326
When I'm on my feet,
I'll make everything up to you.

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:20.620
Of course.

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:25.333
Take me to the cabin.

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.795
What?

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:32.132
He wants to the cabin.

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:38.180
The final. We have to
watch it at the cabin.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:45.145
He said...
- I heard.

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:55.322
I can't take you anywhere.
This is where they'll treat you.

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:59.659
You'll get over this.

01:08:00.619 --> 01:08:03.497
We'll do it together.

01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:12.756
Do you remember Mommy's principles?
Three things.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.639
Don't hit the man on his knees.

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:24.184
Stand up for the underdog.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:28.229
Don't...
- Don't lie.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.524
YES.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:36.113
YES.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.596
Give me a break.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.933
Why not?

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:08.854
In real world
you don't do things like that.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:15.503
Check out what I found.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:21.695
Did you notice
he passed away a while ago?

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:43.049
He wanted you to have this.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.706
Kamal!

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:05.173
You can't do things like that! Where
have you been? Abdi said Nairobi.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:08.718
You just went. Left me alone.

01:13:09.344 --> 01:13:11.888
I wasn't thinking.

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.808
I don't understand that.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.560
Let's all be silent then.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:22.649
Where have you been?
- Shh.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:25.068
Don't say a word.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:27.445
No one says a word.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:10.196
Sorry, Mom.

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.434
<i>Noora.</i>

01:14:40.435 --> 01:14:42.770
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:45.231
Hi. It's Kamal.

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:48.067
<i>Hi.
- Hi.</i>

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:52.197
<i>Are you in Nairobi?
- No, I'm not.</i>
