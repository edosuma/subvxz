00:02.000 --> 00:03.720
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:03.720 --> 00:05.240
Sarah and Duck.

00:05.240 --> 00:06.960
QUACK!

00:06.960 --> 00:08.640
Sarah and Duck.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.880
QUACK!

00:11.080 --> 00:13.160
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!

00:15.800 --> 00:17.240
It's Saturday morning

00:17.240 --> 00:20.920
and Sarah is in the kitchen, getting breakfast ready.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.840
Duck! Breakfast!

00:23.840 --> 00:25.600
SARAH YAWNS

00:28.240 --> 00:29.600
Duck!

00:29.600 --> 00:30.720
Toast!

00:31.960 --> 00:33.360
Duck?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.480
Seems he's overslept again.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.720
You'd think he'd smell the bread a mile off.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.880
Mm.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.720
QUACK, QUACK

00:43.720 --> 00:45.440
Oh, here he comes now.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.320
Hello, sleepy Duck.

00:48.320 --> 00:49.360
QUACK

00:53.760 --> 00:56.760
Toast's probably a bit cold by now, eh, chap?

00:56.760 --> 00:58.000
QUACK!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.760
If you had an alarm clock,

00:59.760 --> 01:02.360
you'd have no problem getting up on time.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.720
Ooh! We can get one from the big shop!

01:05.720 --> 01:09.160
- Right, then, we'd best get going.
- Yes!

01:16.080 --> 01:19.440
So, where might we find the clock department?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.120
Hmmm...

01:24.160 --> 01:26.000
Clock department...

01:28.920 --> 01:30.960
- QUACK!
- What is it, Duck?

01:30.960 --> 01:34.200
TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK! I think he's on to something.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.600
QUACK, QUACK

01:35.600 --> 01:38.320
Oh, tick-tock!

01:38.320 --> 01:40.480
Oh, yes, I hear it too.

01:42.080 --> 01:46.600
Tick, tock, tick, tock,

01:46.600 --> 01:48.480
tick, tock,

01:48.480 --> 01:50.160
bags, tock,

01:50.160 --> 01:52.120
TVs, sock!

01:52.120 --> 01:56.600
Tick, tock, tick, tock...

01:56.600 --> 01:57.760
Clock!

01:57.760 --> 01:59.400
CLOCK CHIMES

01:59.400 --> 02:01.640
This must be the place!

02:01.640 --> 02:03.680
- Yes!
- QUACK!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.880
- CUCKOO!
- Ooh!

02:06.880 --> 02:09.760
Quick, Sarah, it's three o'clock. CUCKOO!

02:09.760 --> 02:12.040
Only one "cuckoo" left to get in!

02:12.040 --> 02:13.120
Agh!

02:13.120 --> 02:14.600
CUCKOO!

02:14.600 --> 02:15.680
QUACK, QUACK!

02:16.920 --> 02:18.520
Phew!

02:18.520 --> 02:20.880
Perfect timing! Ha!

02:23.000 --> 02:26.960
Whoa! So many clocks!

02:28.920 --> 02:30.080
Ooh!

02:30.080 --> 02:31.920
Pretty!

02:31.920 --> 02:34.080
- CUCKOO!
- Oh!

02:34.080 --> 02:36.400
- Hello!
- CUCKOO!

02:36.400 --> 02:38.080
- Huh?
- CUCKOO!

02:38.080 --> 02:40.760
Good thing it's only three o'clock, eh?

02:40.760 --> 02:43.200
How can I help?

02:43.200 --> 02:46.840
Erm, we need an alarm clock for Duck.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.080
QUACK!

02:48.080 --> 02:52.480
Over on the back shelf, past the pocket watches and snooze buttons.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.000
Thank you!

02:54.000 --> 02:57.560
TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK

02:57.560 --> 02:59.240
Interesting...

03:02.920 --> 03:05.200
CLOCKS CHIME

03:05.200 --> 03:08.600
Whoa! Pretty!

03:08.600 --> 03:10.480
Indeed!

03:10.480 --> 03:13.040
One of these, Duck?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.520
TICK...TOCK...

03:15.520 --> 03:17.240
TICK...

03:17.240 --> 03:19.840
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK

03:19.840 --> 03:21.200
TOCK...CLICK...

03:21.200 --> 03:23.040
QUACK!

03:23.040 --> 03:25.280
Perhaps not.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.320
Oh!

03:33.720 --> 03:35.600
QUACK, QUACK

03:35.600 --> 03:37.120
CLOCK BLEEPS

03:37.120 --> 03:38.760
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!

03:38.760 --> 03:40.120
Hmm...

03:40.120 --> 03:42.080
Tricky.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.040
QUACK!

03:48.040 --> 03:49.600
What's this?

03:49.600 --> 03:52.720
It looks like...an egg timer.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.160
Hmm...

03:58.400 --> 04:00.680
QUACK! QUACK, QUACK!

04:00.680 --> 04:03.680
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

04:03.680 --> 04:07.480
Well, that's an unusual way to be woken up.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.400
Ooh, an alarm CLUCK!

04:09.400 --> 04:11.120
QUACK!

04:11.120 --> 04:13.200
Erm, how do you make it stop?

04:13.200 --> 04:14.560
Hmm...?

04:14.560 --> 04:15.720
SQUAWK!

04:15.720 --> 04:17.240
Oh, good!

04:17.240 --> 04:19.640
- This one, Duck?
- QUACK!

04:19.640 --> 04:21.360
That's settled, then.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.560
No?

04:24.560 --> 04:26.720
Need to choose the best one.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.560
Oh, right you are!

04:33.320 --> 04:34.680
Hmm...

04:36.240 --> 04:39.960
SQUAWK! SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

04:39.960 --> 04:43.120
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

04:43.120 --> 04:46.160
SQUAWK! SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

04:48.880 --> 04:50.640
Which one is best, Duck?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.080
I think they're all the same!

04:53.080 --> 04:54.680
Hmm.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.680
- DING! SQUAWK! SQUAWK!
- Oh!

04:59.680 --> 05:03.000
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

05:03.000 --> 05:05.520
QUACK! QUACK! That one?

05:05.520 --> 05:06.840
That one!

05:08.280 --> 05:11.440
QUACK! QUACK!

05:11.440 --> 05:13.760
SQUAWK! SQUAWK! QUACK!

05:13.760 --> 05:16.480
Watch out, it's getting away!

05:16.480 --> 05:19.200
Wait! Egg! We need to pay for you!

05:19.200 --> 05:22.840
SQUAWK! SQUAWK! QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!

05:22.840 --> 05:24.920
That one, please.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.400
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

05:26.400 --> 05:27.880
QUACK, QUACK!

05:27.880 --> 05:29.200
Thank you!

05:31.160 --> 05:33.000
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!

05:35.440 --> 05:37.440
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

05:39.120 --> 05:41.280
SQUAWK! SQUAWK! QUACK!

05:46.720 --> 05:48.320
Hm?!

05:48.320 --> 05:50.440
Good haircut, donkey.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.360
HEE-HAW!

05:52.360 --> 05:54.400
Which way?

05:54.400 --> 05:56.200
Over there, by the fish.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.280
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

05:58.280 --> 06:00.360
QUACK!

06:00.360 --> 06:03.680
SQUAWK! SQUAWK! QUACK!

06:03.680 --> 06:06.760
- QUACK, QUACK, QUACK!
- Ooh!

06:06.760 --> 06:09.880
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

06:09.880 --> 06:11.240
Ah!

06:18.320 --> 06:19.720
Well done!

06:19.720 --> 06:21.040
Phew!

06:22.440 --> 06:25.520
I suppose we'll need to buy the wheel as well.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.640
Yep.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.760
SQUAWK! SQUAWK!

06:31.880 --> 06:33.120
Perfect.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.960
- Uh-huh. Night, Duck.
- QUACK

06:34.960 --> 06:36.640
SARAH YAWNS

06:36.640 --> 06:38.280
Warm toast tomorrow?

06:38.280 --> 06:39.840
- Yes.
- QUACK

06:45.040 --> 06:46.880
Sarah and Duck.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.600
QUACK!

06:48.600 --> 06:50.600
Sarah and Duck.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.240
QUACK!

06:52.240 --> 06:53.840
Sarah and Duck.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.960
QUACK!

06:55.960 --> 06:57.680
Sarah and Duck. QUACK!
