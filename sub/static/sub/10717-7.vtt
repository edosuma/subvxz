WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.293
-Thursdays.
-Why the hell are you naked?

00:03.330 --> 00:06.390
It's after Labor Day!

00:06.440 --> 00:10.729
WOMAN (announcing):
Archer. All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.332
FX presents The Americans.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.847
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:20.880 --> 00:21.972
PHILIP: Martha's seen me.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.578
Did you want her to?

00:23.620 --> 00:25.986
I didn't -- I didn't know
what else to do.

00:26.020 --> 00:30.252
MARTHA: I need to be able just
to -- just reach my husband.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.497
I'm sorry.
There's a lot going on.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.158
I love you.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.020
Tell me Tuesday.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.666
(lowered voice) you wanna find
out who really planted that bug?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.439
Help me track Martha.

00:45.740 --> 00:49.039
A few scattered relationships,
nothing long term.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.206
And then this new boyfriend.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.547
You got a name?

00:51.580 --> 00:53.070
Clark Westerfeld.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.089
If the FBI gets to her --

00:56.120 --> 00:57.542
Will you listen to me?

00:57.590 --> 00:58.739
Martha is done.

00:58.790 --> 01:00.587
I'm never going home, am I?

01:02.430 --> 01:05.228
GABRIEL: I just had an emergency
signal from William.

01:06.630 --> 01:09.269
They can get a sample
from its tissue.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.562
Where's Clark?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.261
Something unexpected
came up.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.733
He'll be back shortly.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.563
Martha, come back
to the house now.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.703
You stay away from me.
I'll scream,

01:19.740 --> 01:22.971
and everybo will know
that you're KGB.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.931
Good.
You're here.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.073
We have a problem.

01:57.110 --> 01:58.304
Martha is gone.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.612
What?

01:59.650 --> 02:01.572
Gone?

02:01.620 --> 02:03.315
Gone?
Gone where?

02:03.350 --> 02:04.578
I don't know.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.281
How?

02:06.320 --> 02:07.981
She ran out.

02:08.020 --> 02:10.784
I went after her,
tried talking to her.

02:10.830 --> 02:15.449
She stood on the street,
threatening to scream "KGB."

02:15.500 --> 02:17.320
I'm sorry.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.338
(sighs)

02:25.010 --> 02:26.830
When did this happen?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.472
It's been 40 minutes.

02:28.510 --> 02:31.604
Any idea
where she might have gone?

02:31.650 --> 02:32.674
No.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.119
All right.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.627
Let's think.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.389
(refrigerator door closes)

02:47.860 --> 02:50.067
If you were her husband...

02:52.030 --> 02:53.065
I don't know.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.658
Rock Creek Park, the zoo.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.509
She likes
watching the panda cubs.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.565
That's it?

02:58.610 --> 02:59.736
(sighs)

02:59.780 --> 03:02.078
We went to
the Tidal Basin once

03:02.110 --> 03:03.372
to look at
the cherry blossoms.

03:03.410 --> 03:04.672
She always
talked about that.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.177
When she first moved
to DC,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.848
she lived near the Capitol,
so downtown maybe.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.689
She goes to church
at First Trinity.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.846
Aanhere else?

03:13.190 --> 03:16.159
Uh...Foundry Branch,
Capital Crescent Trail.

03:16.190 --> 03:18.886
We went for a picnic there once.
It was --

03:18.930 --> 03:21.649
Start with First Trinity,
then the Tidal Basin.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.861
This is a big city.
She could be anywhere.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.869
She's seen your face.

03:32.740 --> 03:34.378
You and Hans should look.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.549
I should wait by the phone
'cause if Martha calls

03:36.580 --> 03:38.400
to leave a message, I need to be
the one who answers.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.714
I'll get an address and tell her
you're on your way.

03:40.750 --> 03:41.944
I'll get Hans.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.538
If you find her,
bring her back.

03:43.590 --> 03:46.980
If it's in public and she starts
screaming again...

03:49.760 --> 03:52.297
...well, you may have
no choice.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.438
(indistinct conversations)

04:44.650 --> 04:46.140
Make sure those accounts
have been frozen.

04:46.180 --> 04:47.943
Excuse us.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.025
(telephone rings in distance)

05:03.670 --> 05:05.797
We got a call
from Minneapolis.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.469
An agent in Bismarck
did a cemetery walk.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.503
Found Clark Westerfeld's
"dead twin" --

05:11.540 --> 05:15.499
a 7-year-old boy who died in
a car accident 30 years ago.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.314
Dead kid's birth date
and Westerfeld's are a match?

05:21.350 --> 05:23.784
_We have Westerfeld's
driver's license Information

05:23.820 --> 05:24.809
from his lease.

05:24.850 --> 05:26.989
Same D.O.B.

05:30.490 --> 05:34.699
So, Martha's boyfriend
has a fake identity.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.020
Well, that's it, then.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.265
I'm sorry, sir.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.907
Uh, get a sketch artist.
See if Carlotti's available.

05:46.940 --> 05:50.944
And bring in the super of
"Clark Westerfeld's" building.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.173
(door opens)

05:59.250 --> 06:01.013
(door closes)

06:07.360 --> 06:09.521
(sighs)

06:26.620 --> 06:29.589
Elizabeth.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.542
Call every half-hour.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.614
Okay.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.189
It's not your fault.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.529
I...shouldn't have
left her alone.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.868
She wasn't alone.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.118
She doesn't know Gabriel.
She knows me.

06:49.970 --> 06:51.699
I'll call.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.105
Okay.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.234
(car door opens)

07:00.620 --> 07:02.315
Gabriel's right.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.454
I know.

07:23.940 --> 07:27.068
**

07:27.110 --> 07:29.772
(indistinct chatter)

07:50.500 --> 07:52.161
(flashlight clicks)

08:00.980 --> 08:03.175
(hair dryer blowing)

08:37.710 --> 08:40.110
(camera shutter clicking)

09:00.040 --> 09:02.065
(doorbell buzzing)

09:09.080 --> 09:11.446
(locks disengage)

09:30.630 --> 09:34.589
This will ring if she calls,
line 2.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.528
I need maps --

09:36.570 --> 09:38.231
D.C. quadrants, um...

09:38.270 --> 09:39.874
Baltimore-Virginia
train schedules,

09:39.910 --> 09:41.605
bus and river routes.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.991
(indistinct conversation)

10:17.450 --> 10:20.669
(indistinct talking
over radio)

10:27.290 --> 10:29.679
(siren wailing in distance)

10:33.860 --> 10:36.351
(breathing heavily)

11:07.000 --> 11:11.664
If you're hungry,
borscht from yesterday.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.736
It's better cold.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.030
I'm never hungry when I'm upset,
but you need to eat.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.024
Ginger?

11:37.060 --> 11:39.358
Very good.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.591
(telephone rings)

11:47.540 --> 11:48.495
Anything?

11:48.540 --> 11:51.168
No, nothing. You?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.336
Uh, no. Hans?

11:52.370 --> 11:54.099
He's at the church.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.608
I, um...
I thought of something.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.940
Um, Martha used to take
long walks, um, by the viaduct

12:00.980 --> 12:02.675
when her mother was sick.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.439
She was scared she'd have to
go home and take care of her.

12:05.490 --> 12:08.209
I'll -- I'll check it out.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.127
Okay.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.028
She'll be --
She'll be okay.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.698
Yeah.

12:16.730 --> 12:17.924
Thanks.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.029
I'll call you back
in 30 minutes.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.298
Okay.

12:22.970 --> 12:26.303
Any luck?

12:26.340 --> 12:28.672
Not yet.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.072
And, uh, you were right.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.543
I'm, um --
I'm not hungry.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.719
Could I get you
anything else?

12:38.750 --> 12:41.082
No.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.929
ButI hadn't had borscht
in a long time.

12:45.790 --> 12:48.623
(indistinct chatter)

13:10.950 --> 13:13.259
What kind of church
does her family go to?

13:13.290 --> 13:14.951
ADERHOLT: Lutheran.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.514
Well, let's make a list
of all the Lutheran churches

13:16.560 --> 13:17.584
in the DC. area.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.585
She went to First Trinity.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.029
On E Street?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.948
Yeah, when times are tough,
people like their God

13:22.000 --> 13:23.297
with all the bells
and whistles.

13:23.330 --> 13:24.797
STAN: You Catholic?

13:24.830 --> 13:26.366
I'm nothing,
but my dad used to

13:26.400 --> 13:28.038
drag me and my brother
to St. Paul's

13:28.070 --> 13:29.469
when he wanted
to make a pomt.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.299
(door closes)

13:33.340 --> 13:35.877
She's got a savings account
at Riggs with $1,700 in it.

13:35.910 --> 13:37.446
Last deposit
was three days ago.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.107
No withdrawals since.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.708
You don't make a deposit

13:40.750 --> 13:41.819
if you're thinking of
making a fast exit.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.317
Unless you're making
a fast exit.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.443
Agent Beeman.

13:45.490 --> 13:48.186
Sir?

13:48.220 --> 13:51.189
Your contact in the Rezidentura,
get in touch with him,

13:51.230 --> 13:53.721
play him the tape,
see if the KGB's got her.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.797
Blackmail is not gonna work
with him, sir.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.491
Well, maybe it'll work,
maybe it won't work,

13:58.530 --> 14:00.464
but, uh, if there's any chance
of getting Martha back,

14:00.500 --> 14:01.569
you got to try it.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.999
I understand that.
I do.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.908
But...this guy,
he's not cut like that.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.476
We have to play
the long game with him.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.829
There's no long game,
Agent Beeman.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.178
Use the goddamn tape.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.974
All that would do
is wreck the operation, sir.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.318
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm sorry.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.341
Martha's on the phone
with her parents!

14:22.190 --> 14:23.726
MOTHER: What a surprise.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.251
Lately you've been calling
on Sundays.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.393
Why are you calling?

14:27.430 --> 14:29.421
Do I need a reason?

14:29.460 --> 14:31.826
Y-Your father's napping.
Let me get him.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.394
No, don't wake him,
Mom.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.429
Oh, I can get him.

14:34.470 --> 14:35.892
Mom?

14:35.940 --> 14:37.407
What is it, clear?

14:37.440 --> 14:40.170
I can't stay
on the phone.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.609
Why?
Is someone waiting for you?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.540
No. Nobody's waiting.

14:43.580 --> 14:45.207
What's wrong?
FATHER: Who is it, clear?

14:45.250 --> 14:47.445
Nothing's wrong.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.175
Hello, sweetheart.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.619
Hi, Daddy.

14:50.650 --> 14:53.118
Hi.
Is everything okay?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.958
Daddy, I'm in trouble.
What --

14:55.990 --> 14:58.424
So, so much trouble.

14:58.460 --> 14:59.779
W-W-Well,
what do you mean?

14:59.830 --> 15:01.422
W-W-W-What kind
of trouble?

15:01.460 --> 15:03.098
It's just not working.

15:03.130 --> 15:05.428
No, no, no. Slow down.
What's -- What's not working?

15:05.470 --> 15:06.960
What's going on?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.139
Daddy, please, just listen.
Just listen.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.603
Okay.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.302
No matter what you hear...

15:13.340 --> 15:15.103
I love you.

15:15.140 --> 15:18.143
Well, w-we love you, too,
sweetie.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.819
You know you're our little girl.
You know that.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.545
I have to go.
But, w--

15:22.580 --> 15:23.808
Martha?

15:23.850 --> 15:26.011
Oh, she hung up.

15:27.090 --> 15:29.411
They wouldn't let her
make that call,

15:29.460 --> 15:31.052
not with us _
up on the line like this.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.751
They don't have her.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.160
(telephone rings)

15:37.200 --> 15:40.465
Gaad here.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.797
Thanks.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.637
She's in Woodley Park.
Got it.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.331
(indistinct chatter)

15:45.370 --> 15:48.828
**

16:39.190 --> 16:42.648
**

16:52.210 --> 16:54.508
Detroit,
you see anything?

16:54.540 --> 16:57.100
WOMAN: Nothing here.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.283
They should do
mile and a half.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.258
Detroit, go from
Wisconsin Avenue Northwest

17:10.290 --> 17:12.053
to P Street Northwest.

17:12.090 --> 17:14.888
Around to 14th Street
Northwest.

17:14.930 --> 17:16.659
MAN: Copy that.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.224
If they don't find her
in 20 minutes,

17:18.270 --> 17:21.194
we'll widen the grid
another two miles.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.205
(engine starts)

17:46.930 --> 17:49.251
Isn't that the bridge
in the picture?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.291
What picture?

17:51.330 --> 17:53.195
Martha and her parents.
