Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:03.790 --> 00:05.763
This better not be an intervention.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.442
You gotta get your ass to rehab.

00:07.476 --> 00:09.849
Why are you here? Why are you
wasting all of our time?

00:09.883 --> 00:11.618
Maybe you're just an asshole.

00:11.653 --> 00:13.959
Your friend Charlie said
you drank your own urine.

00:13.993 --> 00:15.363
Hank Moody.

00:15.398 --> 00:16.640
Is that Atticus Fetch?

00:16.766 --> 00:18.768
Let's make a fuckin' masterpiece.

00:18.802 --> 00:20.170
What do you say?

00:22.706 --> 00:23.807
Are you high right now?

00:25.210 --> 00:27.114
It was such an incredible opportunity,

00:27.149 --> 00:28.619
- I didn't want to miss out.
- When can you start?

00:28.653 --> 00:29.921
I have the job?

00:29.956 --> 00:31.690
What do you do in the real world?

00:31.725 --> 00:34.498
I traverse the globe
in the company of musicians.

00:34.532 --> 00:36.367
- You're a groupie.
- I prefer "muse."

00:36.402 --> 00:40.675
I woke up with the most gifted
guitar player, but he was dead.

00:40.710 --> 00:41.945
Do you want to get high?

00:54.763 --> 00:56.799
Look, could I stand
to lose a few pounds?

00:56.833 --> 00:58.468
Sure, I'm a big boy, I get it,

00:58.502 --> 01:01.473
but addicted to food?
That's just fuckin' gay.

01:01.508 --> 01:03.509
Gay, man--I mean,
no offense, but it's gay.

01:03.543 --> 01:05.378
I eat 'cause I like the taste.

01:05.412 --> 01:07.914
Look, if I didn't like the taste
of it, I wouldn't eat it.

01:07.949 --> 01:11.051
You know what I'm talkin' about,
sweetheart, right? Huh?

01:11.086 --> 01:12.988
But wasn't a trip to the emergency room

01:13.022 --> 01:14.662
what brought you here?
Severe chest pains?

01:14.692 --> 01:16.192
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit.

01:16.226 --> 01:17.827
That was a panic attack,
not a heart attack.

01:17.862 --> 01:20.597
It was a panic attack
brought on by that shrill voice

01:20.632 --> 01:22.333
of that fuckin' mother of mine.

01:22.367 --> 01:24.336
"Oh, you're too fat, Teddy.
You're gonna die.

01:24.371 --> 01:26.105
"You're too fuckin' fat
to do anything, Teddy.

01:26.140 --> 01:28.007
You're too fat
to work the snowblower."

01:28.042 --> 01:30.510
Fuck her. She's the reason
I'm in here, you understand?

01:30.544 --> 01:33.179
They took an EKG on me, all right?

01:33.213 --> 01:34.747
I got the heart of a teenager.

01:37.385 --> 01:39.354
A morbidly obese teenager.

01:39.388 --> 01:42.023
Come on.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.693
Don't be so sensitive.

01:44.727 --> 01:45.761
Faith?

01:45.795 --> 01:48.297
Do you know what time it is?

01:48.332 --> 01:50.867
It's time to get real.

01:50.901 --> 01:53.136
Share with us.

01:53.170 --> 01:54.871
Well, um,

01:54.905 --> 01:57.207
as many of you know...

01:57.242 --> 02:01.045
the other day I woke up next to a guy

02:01.080 --> 02:05.417
I was pretty fucking fond of,
and he was dead.

02:05.451 --> 02:11.089
So tears were shed,
boos were fuckin' hoo'd,

02:11.123 --> 02:13.224
and it sucks to be me.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.726
And that led to the drugs and alcohol.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.894
No, not really.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.898
Um, been on pretty good terms
with drugs and alcohol.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.800
Hallelujah!
Preach on, sister.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.468
You know what I think, Faith?

02:23.502 --> 02:25.603
I think you need to go
and say good-bye to this man.

02:25.637 --> 02:29.140
Too late.
Funeral's happening as we speak.

02:29.175 --> 02:30.943
Well, then you should be there.

02:30.977 --> 02:34.947
That would be a pretty serious
breach of groupie etiquette.

02:34.982 --> 02:36.749
Yeah, well, not healing thyself,

02:36.783 --> 02:38.751
that's a serious breach
of human etiquette.

02:38.785 --> 02:41.653
Bibles of truth, Gabe.
As-salaam alaikum, my brother!

02:42.989 --> 02:44.256
"As-alaika mala."

02:44.290 --> 02:46.759
I'm sorry.

02:46.793 --> 02:49.862
You should go, Faith.
Pay your respects. Say good-bye.

02:49.897 --> 02:51.497
The weight, it will lift off your chest

02:51.532 --> 02:53.433
and you will be able to soar again.

02:53.467 --> 02:56.136
That's all well and good, it really is,

02:56.170 --> 03:00.808
but I can't just show up there
all alone. I c--

03:00.842 --> 03:04.779
I mean, the chick
who rolls up solo to a funeral

03:04.813 --> 03:07.649
is usually the one
who was fucking the dead guy.

03:07.683 --> 03:09.551
Hey, the answer is yes, sweetheart.

03:09.586 --> 03:11.787
I'll be your date, any time.
Here's the thing, though,

03:11.821 --> 03:13.622
can we stop by
an In-N-Out Burger on the way?

03:13.657 --> 03:16.959
I'm fucking famished.

03:16.993 --> 03:18.461
- Hank?
- Yes, Gabe?

03:18.495 --> 03:19.796
I think that you should go with Faith.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.230
Oh, gosh.

03:21.265 --> 03:23.800
I would totally love to, but, uh,

03:23.834 --> 03:25.635
- funerals kinda bum me out.
- Yeah.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.371
Well, I think it would be
a good test for you

03:27.405 --> 03:29.807
to go out into the real world,
see if you can stay sober.

03:29.841 --> 03:31.642
Oh, I don't see why I would.

03:31.677 --> 03:33.178
Yeah. Well, I think
you should try.

03:33.212 --> 03:35.146
Tell me the truth, Gabe.
You just want me

03:35.181 --> 03:37.850
out of your hair for the day,
is that right?

03:37.884 --> 03:38.851
Yes.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.486
That shit is cold.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.321
I'm just sayin'.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.892
Ah, fuck sticks.
I guess a field trip

03:45.926 --> 03:49.162
does sound kinda good to me
right about now. Okay.

03:49.197 --> 03:51.665
Can I bring anything back
for you damaged fuckers?

03:51.699 --> 03:54.902
Some coke? Some heroin?
Some, uh, pink dot?

03:54.936 --> 03:56.337
Yeah, if you go to pink dot,

03:56.371 --> 03:58.005
get me some bon bons
or a double dog, or so--

03:58.040 --> 03:59.673
and don't tease me, pretty boy.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.508
I'll fuckin' lay you out, right?

04:04.546 --> 04:12.546

04:58.363 --> 05:00.063
Nothing.

05:00.097 --> 05:05.334
Man-on-man sex is intriguing,
yes, but not arousing.

05:05.368 --> 05:07.303
That's very interesting.

05:12.108 --> 05:14.844
It's-it's--

05:14.878 --> 05:16.345
it's okay, Charlie.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.748
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, buddy.

05:18.782 --> 05:22.952
It's okay, I-I support you.
In fact, I am proud of you.

05:22.986 --> 05:26.755
No, Hank, no! I was just--
I was testing myself,

05:26.790 --> 05:29.858
'cause I'm in a pickle, Hank.
It's a big, gay pickle.

05:29.893 --> 05:32.161
I'm sure it is, my bald bromosexual,

05:32.195 --> 05:34.463
and I support you no matter
how many dudes you plow.

05:34.497 --> 05:35.764
I just gotta grab a suit.

05:35.799 --> 05:37.166
What are you doing out of rehab?

05:37.200 --> 05:38.701
I got a funeral.

05:38.735 --> 05:40.202
What?
Who died?

05:40.237 --> 05:41.503
A guy I was seeing.

05:41.538 --> 05:42.871
Faith, Charlie.
Charlie, Faith.

05:42.906 --> 05:44.807
Charlie is my bald, gay agent.

05:44.841 --> 05:48.310
Lovely to meet you, Faith.
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

05:48.345 --> 05:50.479
I'm not gay.
Is there anything I can do?

05:50.514 --> 05:53.216
No. Thank you, Charlie.
That's very sweet.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.018
- It's true what they say.
- Oh?

05:55.052 --> 05:56.319
Gay men are more sensitive.

05:56.353 --> 05:58.020
Gonna need the Porsche too.

05:58.054 --> 05:59.989
But I've got a big, gay meeting today.

06:00.023 --> 06:02.991
I believe funeral trumps
big, gay Hollywood meeting,

06:03.026 --> 06:05.160
- don't you think?
- Oh, depends whose funeral,

06:05.194 --> 06:06.428
- I think.
- Dead rock star.

06:06.462 --> 06:09.498
Oh, okay, yeah. Sorry.
Take the car.

06:09.533 --> 06:10.933
Thanks, Charlie.

06:10.967 --> 06:13.936
Now you can get back to your gay porn.

06:13.971 --> 06:15.438
Oh, yeah. Oh.

06:34.159 --> 06:35.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:35.227 --> 06:36.627
Is Krull around?

06:36.662 --> 06:39.096
Uh, that depends.
Are you on the list?

06:39.131 --> 06:41.466
Most definitely not,
my good sir, but, uh,

06:41.500 --> 06:43.534
Krull, the tour manager
should be around here somewhere.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.936
- He'll vouch for me.
- Um, sure, sure,

06:45.971 --> 06:47.705
but maybe I can vouch for you.

06:47.739 --> 06:50.941
Maybe we can make this whole
thing beneficial for both of us.

06:50.976 --> 06:53.644
I mean, I want to get it in,
you want in,

06:53.678 --> 06:55.246
how bad you want it?
Talk to me.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.216
Really, dude? At a funeral?
Have you no shame?

06:59.250 --> 07:00.918
What, are we gonna go
behind a tombstone?

07:00.953 --> 07:02.620
You believe this fuckin' guy?

07:02.654 --> 07:04.555
I'm not gonna suck his dick
to get you in there.

07:04.589 --> 07:05.823
Don't knock it till you try it.

07:05.857 --> 07:06.978
Blowjobs open a lot of doors.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.459
- Bitch.
- Okay, you know what?

07:08.493 --> 07:10.794
Move it along, groupie,
and take him with you.

07:10.829 --> 07:12.896
You watch your tongue,
you filthy mongrel.

07:12.931 --> 07:15.833
This is Faith.
All right?

07:15.867 --> 07:18.068
Have a look and grasp
the cosmic importance

07:18.102 --> 07:20.404
of this lovely, young lady.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.806
Without her there'd be no rock and roll.

07:22.841 --> 07:25.242
Get it?
Got it?

07:25.276 --> 07:27.010
Good, now, fuck off, fatty.

07:28.713 --> 07:30.280
Krull, come here.
Mwah.

07:30.315 --> 07:31.915
Thank you, you're the best.

07:31.949 --> 07:34.618
Anything for you, love.
Who's the civilian?

07:34.652 --> 07:37.320
Hank.
Krull, Hank.

07:37.355 --> 07:40.190
Krull.
Right on.

07:40.224 --> 07:41.191
Good to meet you.

07:41.225 --> 07:43.326
One dead rock star,

07:43.361 --> 07:45.328
now we're dating geezers
from the real world?

07:45.362 --> 07:47.297
Does he look like
he's from the real world?

07:47.331 --> 07:49.932
And do I look like I date?
He's a friend.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.267
Frenemy, really.

07:51.302 --> 07:52.936
Yeah.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.938
What are you doing here, love?
You're not playing nice.

07:54.972 --> 07:56.640
I just came to pay my respects.

07:56.674 --> 08:00.344
I love you, babe, I really do,
but you know what I mean?

08:00.378 --> 08:01.645
It's inappropriate, you bein' here.

08:01.679 --> 08:03.113
It's his old lady.

08:03.147 --> 08:04.948
Come on, Krull, I'll be in and out.

08:04.982 --> 08:08.385
No monkey business, I promise.
Please, don't make me beg.

08:08.419 --> 08:09.719
You promise.

08:09.754 --> 08:12.622
Scout's honor.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.127
All right.

08:17.161 --> 08:18.528
- Kruller, comin' through.
- Not you, pal.

08:18.562 --> 08:20.130
- Not you, pal.
- All right, no plus one.

08:20.164 --> 08:22.166
- Uh-uhh. Mm.
- Good night. Good night.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.815
Ah, hello, hello.
Mm.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.150
Ah, kiss on the head. Ah.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.385
Gotta say, Charlie,
I don't know how I feel

08:41.421 --> 08:43.655
about my new agent showing up in a cab.

08:43.690 --> 08:46.592
Sorry, sorry.
The Porsche is in the shop.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.928
Don't worry, Robbie,
Charlie's gonna get a big raise.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.430
He'll be able to afford a second car.

08:50.465 --> 08:52.666
- I'm getting a raise?
- You bet, buddy.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.570
Partners talked about it.
You're goin' places, Dorothy.

08:56.605 --> 08:57.672
Charlie, I got a question for you.

08:57.706 --> 08:59.007
Yeah, what's that?

08:59.041 --> 09:00.775
How many dicks have you sucked today?

09:03.880 --> 09:07.583
Uh, sadly, it has been
a dick-free day thus far.

09:07.617 --> 09:11.186
Charlie.
Doesn't have to be that way.

09:11.221 --> 09:14.190
- Have you tried Grindr?
- Mm, I don't believe I have.

09:14.224 --> 09:17.025
Ooh, you'd know.

09:17.060 --> 09:19.561
It's an app.
Here, give me your phone.

09:19.596 --> 09:22.397
It's amazing, Charlie.
It uses your GPS.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.700
Anywhere you are, you can
find a guy who's ready to fuck.

09:24.734 --> 09:29.205
Wow.
Steve Jobs. Respect.

09:29.239 --> 09:32.374
There you go. You're all set.
You're the "Bald Bear."

09:32.409 --> 09:35.444
Great.

09:35.479 --> 09:37.379
Okay, Robbie.

09:37.414 --> 09:39.248
You're clean, you're sober,

09:39.282 --> 09:40.950
let's get you back in the game, huh?

09:40.984 --> 09:44.653
Let's remind this town
how fucking good you really are.

09:44.688 --> 09:46.222
All right, I got three scripts here.

09:46.256 --> 09:48.958
Any one of 'em would be a killer move.

09:48.993 --> 09:52.395
This one, a remake of <i>Cruising.</i>

09:53.697 --> 09:55.965
That's an interesting idea.

09:55.999 --> 09:58.234
It's a fucking hot idea is what it is.

09:58.268 --> 10:00.637
Script gave me a raging boner.

10:00.671 --> 10:04.074
Me too.

10:04.108 --> 10:07.678
Oh, there you go.
Your first dick of the day.

10:08.814 --> 10:10.247
Huh? What?

10:10.282 --> 10:12.683
Go for it.
You deserve it.

10:12.717 --> 10:16.086
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.987
I'm good, I'm good,
yeah. See,

10:18.022 --> 10:19.622
I just beat off this morning.

10:19.657 --> 10:21.624
Yeah, should carry me
right through lunch.

10:21.658 --> 10:24.527
Charlie, would you rather beat off

10:24.561 --> 10:26.929
or get your dick sucked
by a 21-year-old

10:26.963 --> 10:29.064
who just skipped out of crunch?

10:31.534 --> 10:35.337
- I see your point.
- Charlie, I insist.

10:35.372 --> 10:38.040
The client insists, Charlie.

10:38.074 --> 10:41.843
Now go get your dick sucked
by a stranger.

11:00.998 --> 11:02.665
Miss you, broheme.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.567
I got the feeling
this is the kind of shindig

11:04.602 --> 11:05.802
you would dig, you know?

11:05.836 --> 11:11.374
Ooh. Howdy.

11:11.408 --> 11:15.211
Howdy yourself.
I'm the widow.

11:15.246 --> 11:19.416
Oh, shitness. My condolies,
and whatnot. I'm Hank.

11:19.450 --> 11:21.551
How do you know my husband?

11:21.585 --> 11:23.420
Oh, I-I didn't. I didn't,
I'm--I'm here with a friend,

11:23.454 --> 11:25.656
and visiting with another friend.

11:25.690 --> 11:27.090
You you know
what the weird thing is, Frank?

11:27.125 --> 11:28.558
Uh, Hank.

11:28.593 --> 11:31.194
My husband's dead and I'm numb.

11:31.229 --> 11:33.363
- It's not so weird.
- I just want to feel something,

11:33.397 --> 11:34.498
- you know? Anything.
- Yeah, you know, it's--

11:34.532 --> 11:36.099
it's understandable.

11:36.133 --> 11:37.500
I-I'm going through
a similar thing right now.

11:37.535 --> 11:40.102
- I-I-I totally understand--
- Shut up!

11:40.137 --> 11:43.406
You'll do.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.407
Uh,

11:45.442 --> 11:47.910
Have you got a few minutes, Frank?

11:47.944 --> 11:49.578
- Well--
- 'Cause I'd really love

11:49.613 --> 11:51.680
to gob your knob.

11:51.714 --> 11:55.050
Well, anything
in your time of need. Come on.

11:57.654 --> 11:58.621
Mm.

12:00.657 --> 12:04.160
Look at this. 'Ello.

12:05.595 --> 12:07.029
Brilliant.

12:07.063 --> 12:08.197
Hey.

12:08.231 --> 12:11.734
Oh, hey, uh, could you, uh,

12:11.768 --> 12:13.602
could you--could you give us
a few minutes here?

12:13.636 --> 12:14.870
Oh, what the fuck, dude?

12:14.904 --> 12:16.371
Can you give me a few minutes?

12:16.406 --> 12:17.886
All right, it's your field trip too.

12:17.907 --> 12:19.107
Come here. Come on--
come here, come here.

12:19.142 --> 12:20.542
- Oh.
- What? Oh.

12:20.576 --> 12:22.110
It was--it was very nice
to meet you...

12:22.145 --> 12:23.545
So nice to meet you.
Brilliant.

12:23.579 --> 12:25.313
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

12:25.348 --> 12:26.981
Not as sorry as I am, my love.

12:27.016 --> 12:30.519
Mm, apparently,
he is not as sorry as I am.

12:32.655 --> 12:35.924
You.

12:35.959 --> 12:36.992
Me?

12:37.026 --> 12:39.828
You look familiar.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.062
I don't believe we've met.

12:41.097 --> 12:43.799
No, I don't believe we have.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.334
You were on the road with him,
weren't you?

12:46.369 --> 12:48.670
Oh, you mean Big Dave in lighting?

12:48.704 --> 12:51.073
Yeah, well, you know, Bingo Starr.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.074
Oh, gimme a break.

12:53.109 --> 12:54.809
You're way too hot for the lighting guy.

12:54.843 --> 12:56.077
Well, thank you.

12:56.112 --> 12:57.912
No, I re-- I remember you.

12:57.947 --> 13:01.649
I remember, the record company
threw some kind of a party.

13:01.684 --> 13:05.420
Was it Greenville?
Maybe, I don't remember,

13:05.454 --> 13:07.822
but you were sort of hangin' around.

13:07.856 --> 13:10.258
There was entirely
way too much eye contact

13:10.292 --> 13:12.493
- between the two of you. Huh?
- Listen, lady,

13:12.528 --> 13:14.262
I-I really don't know
what you're talking about.

13:14.296 --> 13:19.534
He was never gonna leave me,
you know. Ever.

13:19.568 --> 13:21.803
Well, wasn't gonna
write a song about you, either.

13:21.838 --> 13:26.374
Oh, is that what he told you?
That he wrote a song about you?

13:26.409 --> 13:29.110
Ha! How cute!

13:29.145 --> 13:31.780
What was that ballad from
the jazz record, Frank? Help me.

13:31.814 --> 13:33.549
I--I never listen to a--

13:33.583 --> 13:35.517
What was it?
Um, <i>Faith?</i>

13:35.551 --> 13:39.855
I bet you think that
song's about you, don't you?

13:39.889 --> 13:42.057
- Guess I'm just that vain.
- Huh.

13:42.092 --> 13:44.326
Faith.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.294
- Oh, boy.
- Hey,

13:46.329 --> 13:49.631
listen, it's all
just rock and roll, right?

13:49.665 --> 13:54.069
You think I give a fuck
about all his road whores?

13:54.103 --> 13:56.171
I'm the one he came home to.

13:56.206 --> 13:57.339
Thought they had an understanding.

13:57.373 --> 13:59.341
Sorry, I just--

13:59.375 --> 14:01.510
I may not be a nun, but I'm no whore.

14:01.544 --> 14:04.880
Ha! Keep telling yourself
that, sweetie.

14:04.914 --> 14:09.585
And by the way,
our bulldog's named Faith.

14:10.854 --> 14:13.056
Ooh.

14:13.090 --> 14:15.659
You know, all things considered,
that could've gone a lot worse.

14:15.693 --> 14:17.495
Fuck!

14:17.529 --> 14:19.897
God, you know, the last thing
I wanted to do was upset her,

14:19.931 --> 14:21.766
- and...
- Mm-hmm, I know.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.502
I mean, just seeing him
all laid out like that,

14:24.536 --> 14:27.505
- it's just too much, you know?
- Mm.

14:27.539 --> 14:29.440
He even had on his necklace.

14:29.475 --> 14:32.844
His cross.

14:32.878 --> 14:37.215
It was my favorite, and he knew it.

14:37.249 --> 14:39.284
He gave it to me
the night before he died.

14:39.318 --> 14:40.952
I got rushed out of there,
I didn't even think

14:40.987 --> 14:42.921
to take it with me,
and now it's gone forever.

14:42.955 --> 14:45.590
That's--that's the problem
with this open casket shit.

14:45.624 --> 14:47.792
In what universe is seeing
a dead person a good thing?

14:47.826 --> 14:50.194
Shit's fucked up.

14:51.797 --> 14:53.198
Come on, let's just get out of here.

14:53.232 --> 14:54.866
Oh, back to rehab, really?

14:54.900 --> 15:00.304
No, I need a drink, maybe ten.
Then back to rehab.

15:00.339 --> 15:02.172
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

15:05.143 --> 15:07.978
- What are you doing?
- Something idiotic, I'm sure.

15:08.012 --> 15:10.714
If I'm not back in ten minutes,
blow someone to find me.

15:17.488 --> 15:20.457
Right on, bald bear.

15:20.491 --> 15:21.925
Let's do this.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.259
Ho, ho, ho, hold on a second.

15:23.293 --> 15:24.594
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

15:24.628 --> 15:26.729
I have a confession to make.

15:26.763 --> 15:29.265
I'm not really a homosexual man.

15:31.635 --> 15:34.570
So you wanna play this straight?
That's your game?

15:34.605 --> 15:36.839
Whatever, dude,
I just wanna get my dick sucked.

15:36.874 --> 15:40.911
As you should. I totally
understand, and you're entitled.

15:40.945 --> 15:46.417
I'm pro-gay. I'm pro-sexuality
in any form--any form,

15:46.452 --> 15:48.986
and I really respect and admire

15:49.021 --> 15:50.588
the way you guys are using technology

15:50.622 --> 15:52.256
to get your rocks off
in the middle of the day,

15:52.291 --> 15:56.194
but me, myself, I'm not gay.

15:56.228 --> 15:58.496
I just--
I got myself in the middle

15:58.531 --> 16:01.433
of a huge misunderstanding.
Hu-u-uge.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.768
- "Misunderstanding."
- Don't--no, no, no.

16:03.803 --> 16:07.372
Don't do that.
Yes, I sort of

16:07.406 --> 16:10.976
led a prospective client
to believe I was gay,

16:11.010 --> 16:13.845
'cause that's what
he was looking for in an agent.

16:13.879 --> 16:15.547
He wanted
a "gaygent."

16:15.581 --> 16:19.618
So you're pretending to be gay
for career advancement?

16:19.652 --> 16:21.453
That's really offensive, dude.

16:21.488 --> 16:23.122
Robbie Mac is a brave man.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.790
He's one of the first
fully-out movie stars.

16:24.824 --> 16:29.528
I know. He's incredible.
A real trailblazer.

16:29.563 --> 16:30.863
What if I marched out there

16:30.897 --> 16:33.899
and told him what you just told me?

16:36.002 --> 16:37.970
What if I paid you not to?

16:45.612 --> 16:47.379
Forgive me, father, for I am about to

16:47.414 --> 16:50.816
purloin some shit off a dead man.

17:04.631 --> 17:06.271
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

17:06.299 --> 17:11.036
Uh, I'm just paying respects
to a fallen hero.

17:11.069 --> 17:12.337
You kissed him.

17:12.371 --> 17:15.674
Yeah, I-I was overcome
with emotion.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.510
He was my best friend.
A childhood mate.

17:18.544 --> 17:20.545
If anyone's gonna plant lips
on him, it should be me,

17:20.579 --> 17:22.213
or his wife.

17:22.248 --> 17:24.682
Yeah, you--you're right,
it was a miscalculation.

17:24.717 --> 17:26.851
Wait a second.

17:26.885 --> 17:29.720
You're that cheeky fucker who
threw up all over my baby grand

17:29.755 --> 17:31.622
and ruined my cocaine.
The--the writer.

17:31.657 --> 17:33.090
- Hey, nice--
- Who's not a fan of mine.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.358
Well.

17:34.393 --> 17:35.359
What the fuck are you doing here?

17:35.394 --> 17:36.894
I--I'm a big fan.

17:36.928 --> 17:38.595
- Big fan of--
- Oh, so you're a fan of his,

17:38.630 --> 17:39.763
- but not of mine?
- He's a brilliant

17:39.798 --> 17:41.398
fucking guitar player.

17:41.432 --> 17:43.400
Oh, and I'm not brilliant
in my own regard?

17:43.434 --> 17:45.902
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to be a front man?

17:45.936 --> 17:47.470
The--the pressure
that's on me

17:47.505 --> 17:50.874
to entertain millions
of working-class citizens

17:50.908 --> 17:54.211
and constantly reinvent myself
and maintain my beautiful--

17:54.245 --> 17:56.380
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's peachy.

17:56.414 --> 17:58.715
- It's peachy.
- This arrogant fucking wanker

17:58.750 --> 18:00.083
is trying to bugger our dead friend.

18:00.118 --> 18:01.785
Well, maybe we should bugger him.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.086
No, I don't think anybody
should bugger anybody.

18:03.121 --> 18:04.288
- Yeah.
- Come on, now. Come on, boys,

18:04.322 --> 18:05.656
boys, this is really my fault.

18:05.690 --> 18:07.090
He was just trying
to get my necklace back.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.326
You--you're stealing from a dead man?

18:09.360 --> 18:10.660
- No--
- Technically, yes--

18:10.695 --> 18:12.896
Tony gave it to me, okay?

18:12.931 --> 18:14.464
It's the only thing he ever gave me.

18:14.499 --> 18:16.833
Faith, you need to hit the road, love.

18:16.867 --> 18:20.237
Wait a second.
This is Faith?

18:20.271 --> 18:21.639
Yes.

18:21.673 --> 18:24.008
It is a pleasure to meet you,
sweetheart.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.409
Tony talked about you all the time.

18:25.444 --> 18:26.844
Oh!

18:26.879 --> 18:29.313
He said you had an uncanny ability

18:29.348 --> 18:30.948
- to suck killer riffs out of him.
- Ah!

18:30.982 --> 18:35.019
What the fuck is this
skanky skank still doing here?

18:35.053 --> 18:36.287
- I was just leaving.
- All right, yeah.

18:36.321 --> 18:37.956
Good!
No, he can stay.

18:37.990 --> 18:39.430
- Oh, ladies, ladies--
- He can stay.

18:39.458 --> 18:40.792
It's big enough for the both of you.

18:40.826 --> 18:42.093
I think she should probably stay too.

18:42.127 --> 18:44.529
Uh, if she insists on staying,

18:44.564 --> 18:47.599
then I insist on kicking her
in the fucking cunt!

18:49.135 --> 18:50.302
- Oh, the fucking cunt!
- That's enough.

18:51.538 --> 18:52.638
I'll kill you!

18:52.672 --> 18:54.106
I'll kill you!

18:56.176 --> 18:57.276
Oh.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.378
Oh, no! My hair!

18:59.413 --> 19:02.115
Stop it!
Stop it! No!

19:02.150 --> 19:03.784
- Come on, it's time.
- No!

19:03.818 --> 19:04.785
It's time.

19:05.820 --> 19:08.622
Hello, Los Angeles!

19:08.656 --> 19:11.458
If you're seeing me
in this badass holographic form,

19:11.493 --> 19:12.626
that means I must be dead,

19:12.660 --> 19:14.361
which totally sucks for me,

19:14.396 --> 19:16.130
but I don't want any of you good people

19:16.164 --> 19:19.300
feeling sorry for me.
I've had a great fucking life.

19:19.334 --> 19:20.902
I want to thank you all

19:20.936 --> 19:24.138
for coming out
to celebrate my untimely demise.

19:24.172 --> 19:26.307
I leave you with this...

19:51.400 --> 19:52.833
Come here, baby.

19:52.868 --> 19:54.735
Come here.

19:54.770 --> 19:56.537
I'm sorry I was such a bitch.

19:56.572 --> 20:00.174
No, God, I'm so sorry
I fucked your husband.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.709
Hey.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.347
It's rock and roll, right?

20:07.382 --> 20:09.116
Yeah, yeah.

20:09.150 --> 20:10.918
Oh.

20:10.952 --> 20:12.853
It's not the dope talking,

20:12.887 --> 20:14.521
but I still really dig
your writing, man.

20:14.556 --> 20:16.757
Thank you.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.426
Yeah, thanks.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.862
You really gotta check out
some of my earlier stuff.

20:21.896 --> 20:24.131
There's some good shit on there.

20:24.165 --> 20:26.633
Before everything
got so fucking polished.

20:28.903 --> 20:30.904
Fucking pro tools.

20:37.478 --> 20:41.281
That dead man there was my best friend.

20:41.315 --> 20:42.916
We met when we were five years old.

20:44.653 --> 20:47.321
We used to go around to
his mum and dad's after school

20:47.355 --> 20:51.726
and wear out their copy
of <i>Exile On Main Street.</i>

20:51.760 --> 20:54.929
One day he showed me his penis.

20:54.963 --> 20:58.099
It was alarmingly big
for a five-year-old.

20:59.969 --> 21:01.236
He told me when he grew up

21:01.270 --> 21:04.306
he wanted to be a rock and roll star,

21:04.340 --> 21:06.675
and bugger me if he didn't
grow up and do just that.

21:08.544 --> 21:10.912
So before we put that fucker
in the ground,

21:10.947 --> 21:13.749
I'd like to play you
one of his favorite songs.

21:13.783 --> 21:15.684
After that, you're all invited
back to my place.

21:15.718 --> 21:20.289
We'll consume narcotics,
and listen to <i>Exile,</i> and...

21:22.224 --> 21:25.995

22:11.776 --> 22:15.145
I was tempted to partake,
but it seems like

22:15.180 --> 22:18.182
the kind of night where you need
to feel everything.

22:18.216 --> 22:21.319
Even if it hurts so bad you want
to tear your fucking skin off.

22:21.353 --> 22:24.055
Mm.
I hear that, pretty lady.

22:24.089 --> 22:26.757
Oh, shit, I almost forgot.

22:38.303 --> 22:40.271
This means so much.

22:40.305 --> 22:42.040
Thank you.

22:43.709 --> 22:44.776
Thank you.

22:44.810 --> 22:47.378
So what now?
Back to rehab?

22:47.413 --> 22:49.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

22:49.715 --> 22:51.449
Just to pick up my stuff.

22:51.483 --> 22:55.185
I think it's time to come back to life.

22:55.220 --> 22:57.454
- Mm.
- Road beckons.

22:57.489 --> 23:01.692
- Another project awaits.
- Really? Project?

23:01.726 --> 23:05.029
Yeah.
They're my projects.

23:05.063 --> 23:09.033
Yeah, I see a spark,
a flash of true genius,

23:09.067 --> 23:11.402
- and I have to help.
- Mm.

23:11.436 --> 23:13.203
I want them to be
the very best they can be.

23:13.237 --> 23:15.539
You sound like
quite the patron of the arts.

23:15.573 --> 23:19.909
It's what I do. Hmm.
How 'bout yourself?

23:19.943 --> 23:21.377
What about me?

23:21.411 --> 23:23.212
What's next?

23:23.247 --> 23:25.614
Oh, I suppose I should write something.

23:25.648 --> 23:27.816
Sit my ass in a chair.
The chair beckons.

23:27.850 --> 23:30.252
Good for you.

23:32.356 --> 23:34.723
Right, 'cause it's just that easy.

23:34.758 --> 23:37.159
Have a little faith, Hank.

23:43.833 --> 23:45.234

23:46.870 --> 23:49.739
Hank Moody, get up
off your ass and come with me.

23:49.773 --> 23:52.341
I'm gonna play you
the greatest song ever written

23:52.376 --> 23:53.943
in the history of the universe.

23:53.978 --> 23:56.813
After which, we shall snort cocaine

23:56.847 --> 24:00.116
and have our assholes
tongued by the angels.

24:23.374 --> 24:26.276
Okay, hi.

24:26.310 --> 24:28.779
Good morning, gorgeous.

24:28.813 --> 24:32.449
- Um...
- Yes, please. I'd love some.

24:32.484 --> 24:33.884
Some what?

24:33.919 --> 24:36.954
Some of your delicious
girl scout cookies.

24:36.988 --> 24:38.455
No, I'm not that.

24:38.490 --> 24:40.191
I'm--I'm here to see Natalie.
Yeah.

24:40.225 --> 24:41.459
Natalie, Natalie.

24:41.493 --> 24:45.629
- Ah, Natalie's my wife.
- Oh.

24:45.664 --> 24:47.731
Natalie took the children to school.

24:47.766 --> 24:50.635
Natalie said,
"Let the new designer in."

24:50.669 --> 24:52.169
Th--that's me. It's--

24:52.204 --> 24:54.471
What Natalie failed to say

24:54.506 --> 24:59.009
is how absolutely fucking
smokingly gorgeous you are.

25:00.845 --> 25:03.414
- I'm gonna go, and then--
- You're gonna come in.

25:03.448 --> 25:06.818
I'm incredibly interested
in what your plans are

25:06.852 --> 25:09.320
for the interior of my home.

25:09.355 --> 25:12.991
Um, could--
could you put some clothes on?

25:13.025 --> 25:14.860
Why would I put some clothes on?

25:14.894 --> 25:17.662
This is the way the baby Jesus made me.

25:17.696 --> 25:19.564
That's nice.
Uh--

25:19.598 --> 25:22.601
I'm joking. Come on,
I'll dig up some trousers.

25:22.635 --> 25:26.004
Are you a fan of mine?
As I am of yours?

25:26.038 --> 25:30.242
Um, you could--
uh, I--I don't know. Uh...

25:35.381 --> 25:37.216
You attached?

25:37.250 --> 25:38.684
Excuse me?

25:38.718 --> 25:41.554
Are you spoken for?
Do you have a lover?

25:41.588 --> 25:43.455
Or many lovers?

25:43.490 --> 25:47.126
There are no wrong answers here,
only arousing ones.

25:53.633 --> 25:54.867
Mm.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.903
You know that fucker?

25:56.937 --> 26:00.373
Oh, yeah.
I know this fucker.

26:00.407 --> 26:03.376
This fucker is supposed to be
in rehab right now.

26:03.410 --> 26:06.379
That fucker was
about a million miles away

26:06.413 --> 26:08.214
from rehab last night.

26:08.248 --> 26:10.983
We shared an eight ball,
among other things.

26:11.018 --> 26:15.221
We spoke of hopes and dreams,
of what the world needs now.

26:15.255 --> 26:18.658
I played him a song
inspired by his "Magnus Opum,"

26:18.692 --> 26:22.061
a song about the healing power
of sex and love

26:22.096 --> 26:25.398
and rock and roll.
He said it sounded

26:25.432 --> 26:29.102
like a pit bull
raping a small, deaf child.

26:29.136 --> 26:30.570
I don't think he meant it

26:30.605 --> 26:31.845
as a compliment!

26:31.872 --> 26:35.141
No, he can be a tough critic that way.

26:35.176 --> 26:38.912
Ow.
Ow, stop kicking me.

26:38.946 --> 26:40.413
Wha--?

26:40.447 --> 26:43.316
Karen, what the fuck?

26:43.350 --> 26:45.018
Hey, you stole my line.

26:45.052 --> 26:47.186
No, then it must be a sign.

26:47.221 --> 26:51.425
It appears that I've had
a relapse of some sort.

26:51.459 --> 26:55.195
I've been tested
and found severely lacking,

26:55.230 --> 26:59.033
and I should probably
go back to rehab posthaste.

26:59.067 --> 27:01.268
You think maybe you can--
you can give me a ride?

27:01.302 --> 27:04.171
Probably get myself--

27:04.206 --> 27:08.509
Oh, well, maybe--
maybe just a few more winks.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.778
I was having the nicest dream.

27:10.813 --> 27:13.014
I was on a beach somewhere with you

27:13.049 --> 27:16.986
and God was marrying us,
and you turned into a mermaid,

27:17.020 --> 27:18.621
and I couldn't find your vagina,

27:18.655 --> 27:20.390
and your hair was covering your breasts,

27:20.424 --> 27:21.825
which was kind of pissing me off,

27:21.859 --> 27:23.627
and then someone was kicking me.

27:23.661 --> 27:25.629
He's fine.

27:25.663 --> 27:29.066
It's cocaine-induced dementia,
there's nothing to worry about.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.301
He just needs his beauty sleep.

27:31.335 --> 27:34.471
In the meantime,
would you like to hear a song

27:34.505 --> 27:37.574
that I penned about the problems
in the Sudan?

27:37.608 --> 27:40.310
I'd really appreciate your take.
