[theme music plays]

00:50.842 --> 00:52.761
[Clay]  It comes down to one question.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.971
Will you survive high school?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.681
Will I survive?

00:57.682 --> 00:59.851
'Cause I know too many people who didn't.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.650
We have said too many goodbyes,

01:08.735 --> 01:10.779
grieved too long.

01:12.655 --> 01:16.409
Liberty High has endured enough traumas
and tragedy,

01:17.077 --> 01:20.121
and the loss of another classmate
senior year...

01:21.331 --> 01:27.003
is more than children should be asked
to bear, but Liberty is not alone.

01:27.879 --> 01:32.717
Too many high schools today are forced
to reckon with tragedy.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.721
Too many of our young people
are not making it to graduation,

01:36.805 --> 01:40.767
and we are doing too little
to make change.

01:40.850 --> 01:45.772
And we must ask
not only how we can make change,

01:46.648 --> 01:50.485
but what we have done
to shape their world this way.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.114
How are we responsible?

01:57.534 --> 02:00.161
What burdens are we placing
on our young people?

02:02.205 --> 02:04.415
What tools are we keeping from them?

02:07.418 --> 02:08.837
How did we get here...

02:10.588 --> 02:11.589
again?

Justin?

03:17.947 --> 03:18.990
Put your clothes on.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.909
We gotta go.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.037
Where are we going?

03:24.704 --> 03:27.207

[Monty] What?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.025
What the fuck do you want?

03:54.108 --> 03:56.236
Monty, we're sorry.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.073
We didn't think this would happen.
We thought...

04:00.823 --> 04:02.700
I mean, we thought you were dead.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.870
-We didn't think that--
-You wanted to clear your name?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.289
So you set me up for murder?

04:08.373 --> 04:11.334
We were trying to protect someone else.
We thought you were gone.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.212
They carried me out like I was,

04:14.295 --> 04:18.091
but, you know, 200 stitches
and a few surgeries, and here I am.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.803
-We can work this out.
-No, we can't fucking work it out!

04:21.886 --> 04:24.764
I'm going away for life.
What the fuck are we going to work out?

04:24.847 --> 04:26.891
Well, there'll be a trial,
and we can testify--

04:26.975 --> 04:30.270
Guys like me, they don't get trials.
And what about Bryce?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.230
What about Bryce?

04:33.022 --> 04:35.733
-How does he get justice?
-Bryce hurt a lot of people.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.819
Yeah, and you're no better than he is.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.905
You fuck with whoever you want,
ruin people's lives.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.949
Bryce was a fucking rapist,

04:43.366 --> 04:44.450
and so were you.

[groans]

It's pretty messed up,
but I'm good at hiding shit, so...

I don't think my parents have noticed.

[Mrs. Jensen sighs]

05:16.649 --> 05:20.653
Clay, honey, um, you sure you don't want
to come with us to the facility today?

05:21.362 --> 05:22.280
Might be fun.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.242
When is anything called a facility
ever fun? [chuckles]

05:27.285 --> 05:28.995
-Justin might like to see you.
-Mm.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.913
I'll see him at home...

05:31.748 --> 05:32.749
at the party.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.256
Clay, your, um, first-semester grades
came in yesterday.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.052
-How do you have my grades?
-[Mrs. Jensen] The school email.

05:44.719 --> 05:45.720
As always.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.057
Oh.

05:51.017 --> 05:51.851
Right.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.354
I didn't...

05:55.563 --> 05:57.440
I didn't do too well on my finals.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.152
-Which is understandable.
-We're going to talk to the school.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.904
-No!
-We're going to talk to them

06:02.987 --> 06:06.199
about some allowances
for what you've been through,

06:06.741 --> 06:08.826
but... [sighs] ...Clay,

06:09.911 --> 06:11.829
you need to be thinking about college.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.042
Have you finished your apps?

06:16.125 --> 06:19.545
[voice distorts] We just want you to feel
like you can come to us for anything,

06:19.629 --> 06:21.881
but if you don't feel
like you can come to us for anything,

06:21.964 --> 06:25.426
then I think we need to start thinking
about starting up again with Dr. Ellman.

-[Mrs. Jensen's voice echoes]
-[smashing]

06:28.179 --> 06:29.138
[Mr. Jensen] Shit!

06:30.765 --> 06:31.599
Sorry.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.063
So, Clay, what do you think?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.440
[stutters] About what?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.651
About seeing Dr. Ellman.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.655
Um...

06:47.532 --> 06:48.616
I don't know.

[suspenseful music plays]

07:07.802 --> 07:10.138
[Clay]  Here's the thing, I'm basically OK.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.474
[squelching]

07:15.435 --> 07:19.147
I mean, as OK as you can be
a month out from being in jail for murder.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.815
[phone buzzing]

07:23.818 --> 07:24.819
[Clay]  Hey, Tyler.

07:29.907 --> 07:30.741
What?

07:32.034 --> 07:33.161
Did they say why?

07:36.414 --> 07:37.915
OK, hey, just listen.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.586
Just calm down, breathe,
sit tight, and give me a few minutes.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.716
[Clay]  But then a friend needed me,
and it was like I was alive again.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.305
My girlfriend, no.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.308
She doesn't need me.

07:56.184 --> 08:00.521
Well, I think she loves me,
or at least she likes me.   I think.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.522
[Ani] Hey!

08:02.982 --> 08:04.317
Hey, you're early.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.319
Nice to see you as well.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.114
-What is it?
-I was...

08:10.865 --> 08:13.159
I was hoping we could talk about...

08:13.868 --> 08:14.869
us and everything.

08:14.952 --> 08:15.912
OK, I gotta go.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.039
I... I'm... Tyler got called in

08:18.122 --> 08:19.707
-to talk to the sheriff.
-What the fuck?

08:19.790 --> 08:22.168
He's alone at home. His parents
don't know. I gotta drive him.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.212
-Does he think it's about Bryce?
-He doesn't know.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.463
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.007
You should stay
and help Jess set up for the party,

08:28.090 --> 08:29.258
or she'll freak out.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.260
OK, are you freaking out?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.512
No, I'm good. I'm...

08:32.845 --> 08:34.722
-I'm totally good.
-Clay, look at me.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.057
Look at me. Clay.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.727
-This will be fine.
-Yeah. No, I know. I got this.

-[footsteps receding]

08:48.945 --> 08:51.030
[Clay]  Why do I take care of my friends?

08:51.405 --> 08:53.449
Because they need me.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.494
All right, just be calm
so you can think clearly.

08:56.577 --> 09:00.081
If it gets rough, you stop them,
ask for a lawyer, and call me.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.958
All right. Yeah, got it.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.793
[inhales, exhales deeply]

09:20.268 --> 09:22.311
[Tyler] Clay, why is this happening now?

09:22.770 --> 09:23.854
I'm not sure...

09:24.897 --> 09:27.525
but it's gonna be fine, OK?

09:29.151 --> 09:30.528
You trust me, right?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.115
Always.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.122
[sighs, inhales, exhales deeply] OK.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.755
[Clay]  It's nothing in particular.
It's just high school nowadays.

09:50.673 --> 09:54.969
You can never let your guard down
because it never fucking ends.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.641
And friends have to rely on each other,
or bad shit might happen.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.352
It smells like an ass wore shoes in here.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.897
Like, ass shoes on a dead animal.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.065
Is Clay all right?

10:08.524 --> 10:10.693
Yeah... Yeah, he's fine.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.446
Stellar.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.365
Do you love him,
or are you just taking care of him?

10:17.366 --> 10:19.910
Uh, don't we take care
of the people that we love?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.912
I mean, he's been going through a lot.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.334
[Jess] So you haven't told him
about Oakland.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.585
Um... [Ani sighs]

10:28.044 --> 10:29.045
Not yet.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.589
I was meant to tell him today,

10:31.672 --> 10:34.842
but we don't move
until after Christmas, so--

10:34.925 --> 10:36.344
You've known for a week,

10:36.761 --> 10:40.014
and you knew once you told him,
he'd go all Clay cray.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.266
Clay-zy.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.603
-No, I like Clay cray.
-OK, no.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.689
Look. Honestly,
I was gonna tell him just now, but...

10:50.232 --> 10:52.318
well, he had to take care of something.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.528
-What, something about Justin?
-No.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.074
All's good there.
He's still due home at four, so breathe.

11:00.201 --> 11:04.497

so I gotta, like, be strong and stuff.

Hey.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.269
Hey, are you OK?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.438
Yeah.   Fine.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.483
What happened?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.111
They found the guns... [pants]

12:17.862 --> 12:18.904
...in the river.

12:18.988 --> 12:19.822
Fuck.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.199
And they couldn't trace it
to anyone at first.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.703
You know, there's no serial number,
no prints, but the bag...

12:26.370 --> 12:28.873
they traced the bag
to the store I bought it from.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.920
But I told them that I bought it,
but that someone else stole it from me.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.756
And they believed you?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.257
Well, Alex's dad was there.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.341
He helped me out.

I think we're OK.

for now.

Yeah.

-Yeah?
-Yeah, for sure.   Yeah. [sighs]

12:53.731 --> 12:56.734

about what I'm going through

It's for Justin, I know.

You're late.

I know.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.857
Oh, absolutely.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.901
Same as Jessica. Home by ten.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.531
Nine.

26:15.907 --> 26:16.741
Eight?

26:17.158 --> 26:17.993
Sundown.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.413
Colonel, I'll need your contact details
in case of emergency.

26:21.496 --> 26:22.622
Aye, aye, Captain.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.960
Just right this way.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.633
[Jess]  It'll be fucking great.
I'm so sick of boys.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.844
I mean, for me.
You and Clay, that's great.

26:36.219 --> 26:39.389
And now you don't have to do
the long-distance. Huge relief, right?

26:39.681 --> 26:40.890
No, right, that's...

26:41.516 --> 26:42.517
huge.

26:43.143 --> 26:46.021
You won't even have to tell him
that you were gonna leave.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.482
Sorry, um... where are we exactly?

26:49.566 --> 26:52.068
Oh, Dad used to take us here for cookouts.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.405
And we're here now because...

26:55.989 --> 26:57.365
To deal with this.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.411
Is that Bryce's?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.164
Last remaining copy in the wild.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.627
Jess, what are you doing?

27:08.710 --> 27:09.711
Starting a fire.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.215
Are you sure?

27:15.550 --> 27:16.760
It's his last words.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.470
Did you want to hear them again?

27:19.262 --> 27:20.096
No.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.015
No, of course not.

27:24.768 --> 27:25.769
[Ani sighs]

27:30.523 --> 27:31.608
[Jess sighs]

27:44.788 --> 27:46.206
Toast? To Bryce?

27:47.248 --> 27:48.333
No, thank you.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.465
You wanted to leave, didn't you?

27:57.467 --> 27:59.219
To get away from all of this?

27:59.636 --> 28:01.680
I didn't  want  to.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.642
Then why didn't you tell anyone?

28:06.768 --> 28:07.769
I told you.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.566
[flames roar]

28:23.034 --> 28:24.369
[shrieking, sobbing]

28:25.203 --> 28:26.538
Jess!

28:27.539 --> 28:29.249
[Jess pants] Oh, fuck!

28:36.172 --> 28:37.132
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.469
So, everything still good?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.554
With Tyler?

28:42.637 --> 28:45.598
[Clay] Yeah. I spoke to him every day
over break. Story hasn't changed.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.976
What does Alex say?
Does his dad think that...

28:50.103 --> 28:51.187
What the hell?

28:51.896 --> 28:53.356
[students exclaim in shock]

28:58.069 --> 29:02.741
[guard] All right. Go ahead, step through.
Backpacks on the table, please.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.451
What the actual fuck?

29:05.702 --> 29:07.579
-Keep coming.
-Don't lose your shit.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.831
Well, I haven't lost it yet, have I?

29:10.248 --> 29:12.417
-[guard] Have your backpacks off.
-[sighs]

29:12.959 --> 29:14.210
[guard] Your bag, please.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.045
[scanner buzzes]

29:19.215 --> 29:20.425
Backpack on the table.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.177
Knock yourself out.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.847
[scanner buzzes]

29:27.182 --> 29:29.225
-[scanner beeps rapidly]
-[Jess sighs]

29:29.642 --> 29:33.646
-Please step aside for a screening.
-It's probably the metal wire in my bra.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.482
We'll see.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.650
Step aside for a pat-down.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.153
I sure as shit hope
you have a female officer to do it,

29:40.236 --> 29:42.947
'cause you and your boys
aren't putting that anywhere near my body.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.282
[guard] Young lady,

29:44.949 --> 29:47.327
step aside now.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.245
[chuckles lightly]

29:49.829 --> 29:50.705
Whatever.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.791
Hey! Get back here!

29:54.667 --> 29:55.710
[Ani sighs heavily]

29:58.171 --> 30:00.507
Think it's a coincidence
the school installed metal detectors

30:00.590 --> 30:02.967
less than two weeks
after the cops talked to Tyler?

30:03.051 --> 30:06.137
Bureaucracies don't move that fast,
like, ever.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.015
They know. They have to know.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.267
Yeah,
or the school's just covering its arse

30:11.351 --> 30:14.562
after being ground zero
for a high-profile murder investigation.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.647
[Clay sighs]

30:17.690 --> 30:19.150
Just take your own advice:

30:20.193 --> 30:21.986
-stay calm.
-[breathes deeply]

30:26.324 --> 30:27.867
[school bell rings]

30:28.952 --> 30:30.620
[Jess]  I'm not gonna apologize.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.415
If you're gonna turn Liberty
into a full-on police state,

30:34.499 --> 30:36.125
then at least show your female students--

30:36.209 --> 30:37.377
Police state's a strong word.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.004
Then at least show your female students
some respect

30:40.088 --> 30:44.092
by hiring actual female officers
to do the so-called screenings.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.845
You're absolutely right, Ms. Davis.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.806
Uh... you have my sincere apology.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.975
-I do?
-And moving forward,

30:52.058 --> 30:55.144
I'd love to get your input
as we implement these new measures.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.438
[chuckles] You're trying to keep me quiet.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.149
Oh, when have I ever been able
to keep you quiet?

31:00.733 --> 31:02.610
Look, we want the same thing.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.989
To make kids feel safe, to protect them.

31:07.782 --> 31:08.950
You believe me, don't you?

31:09.492 --> 31:11.536
-I guess.
-Then will you help me?

31:12.036 --> 31:13.246
Help you how?

31:13.329 --> 31:14.998
Tell me the truth in confidence,

31:15.081 --> 31:17.041
and if there's anything
that you're worried about,

31:17.125 --> 31:19.919
if you see anything going on,

31:20.837 --> 31:21.921
you come to me first.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.593
[Clay]  The future fair.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.303
They changed it from college fair

31:28.386 --> 31:31.639
because there's this new thing
that not all kids should go to college,

31:31.723 --> 31:35.768
and they threw in, like, clubs and firemen
just so no one felt left out.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.771
Look, it's all a fucking joke.
This planet has no future.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.733
So Bolan didn't reprimand you?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.110
He just wanted a chat?

31:44.569 --> 31:46.321
Crazy, right?

31:46.696 --> 31:51.034
What, and he didn't ask you for anything
or to do anything?

31:51.117 --> 31:52.076
Or not do?

31:52.702 --> 31:53.536
No.

31:54.078 --> 31:54.913
Nothing.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.082
Good turnout this year, right?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.334
Is it? [scoffs]

32:00.627 --> 32:02.253
[suspenseful music plays]

32:06.132 --> 32:07.133
[Ani] I, uh...

32:10.970 --> 32:12.055
I'll be right back.

32:12.847 --> 32:14.140
Where are you going?

32:14.557 --> 32:15.516
[Jess] Ani!

32:18.311 --> 32:20.730
Hi, um, I'm Estella.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.400
I know who you are.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.653
Sorry.

32:30.406 --> 32:31.282
Sorry.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.286
I just wanted to say
I really admire what you're doing.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.623
Trying to change the culture
of the school?

32:39.832 --> 32:41.751
Oh... thanks.

32:42.251 --> 32:45.672
[Estella] I know you've been through
some shit, and you're so strong.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.759
I guess I'm just asking if I can join HO.

32:50.551 --> 32:53.638
And I know because of everything,
it's really complicated,

32:53.721 --> 32:54.931
but I'd like to join,

32:55.932 --> 32:57.141
if that's OK with you?

32:58.726 --> 32:59.727
Of course.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.399
Of course you can join.
It's a safe space for everyone.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.193
Thanks.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.713
Well, have you thought
about the service academies?

33:26.796 --> 33:28.506
It's a great four-year education.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.259
Nah, just enlisting.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.179
Look, I think any of the services
would be lucky to have you as an officer

33:35.263 --> 33:37.223
after you graduate college,

33:37.306 --> 33:39.642
but just enlisting
after you finish high school

33:39.726 --> 33:41.269
is a waste of your gifts.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.770
That's a good point.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.148
I don't know, we'll see.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.859
-[recruiter] Think about it.
-[Zach] Appreciate that.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.369
-Community college?
-Consider it a stepping stone.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.705
After a year,
you can transfer someplace else.

34:01.664 --> 34:04.042
[scoffs] Well,
I appreciate the thought, really,

34:04.125 --> 34:07.795
but I don't really think I'm...
college material.

34:07.879 --> 34:11.382
Too bad. I was told you were the type
never to run away from a fight.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.647
Not too bad,

34:27.356 --> 34:30.902
but I'm kind of a Nikon Nazi,
and all you got here are 5Ds, so...

34:30.985 --> 34:33.362
I don't really think I could partake.
Sorry.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.032
-OK.
-[shutter clicks]

34:36.115 --> 34:37.700
[chuckles] I'm kidding.

34:38.242 --> 34:39.160
[chuckles]

34:39.577 --> 34:42.288
Hey, you were at the homecoming game,
right? November?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.416
God, I was there for Hillcrest yearbook.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.920
Oh, yeah, right.
I thought I recognized you. It's, um...

34:49.879 --> 34:51.255
-Winston, right?
-Yeah.

34:51.631 --> 34:53.091
Pretty wild night, right?

34:53.174 --> 34:55.301
-Yeah.
-I'm sure you got some good stuff.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.386
-[Tyler] Hey, Ani!
-Hey.

34:57.470 --> 35:01.265
Uh... Sorry. Winston,
this is my friend Ani. Ani, Winston.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.934
Yes, we just met, actually.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.728
Hey, Ani.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.564
Winston, you wanted me
to introduce you to the Mathletes?

35:10.358 --> 35:11.692
Right, sure. Yeah.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.902
[Winston chuckles]

35:13.569 --> 35:14.570
Catch you around.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.907
[Justin] Where are all the nerds?

35:18.324 --> 35:20.409
Thought you guys were saving the future.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.497
You know what? I may or may not
have been telling people

35:24.580 --> 35:27.166
that there, in fact, is no future, so...

35:29.627 --> 35:30.461
What's that?

35:31.879 --> 35:34.590
Uh... It's... Dr. Singh.

35:35.591 --> 35:38.678
Guess she heard
that there's an admissions officer

35:38.761 --> 35:40.096
that was interested in me?

35:41.848 --> 35:42.849
At Occidental?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.309
They liked my essay.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.355
I guess if you have, like,
life circumstances

35:49.438 --> 35:51.482
and a good story or whatever.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.030
Anyway,
it's not like I'm gonna get in, so...

35:58.906 --> 35:59.949
don't worry.

36:00.783 --> 36:01.909
Why would I worry?

36:03.035 --> 36:05.163
You should go if you can,
it's a great school.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.377
[Ani]  What do you mean you go here now?

36:12.753 --> 36:13.754
I transferred.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.298
[Ani] Why?

36:16.716 --> 36:17.717
I got expelled.

36:18.217 --> 36:21.012
That kid Bryan Chu got caught
hacking the school servers

36:21.095 --> 36:24.015
and ratted us all out
to save his sorry little ass, so...

36:24.974 --> 36:27.852
bye-bye, Hillcrest and Princeton.

36:29.145 --> 36:29.979
Shit.

36:30.062 --> 36:32.732
[Winston] It's kind of a relief, really.
Getting caught.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.193
I don't have to live
with that secret anymore, you know?

36:36.903 --> 36:38.070
That shit can kill you.

36:39.655 --> 36:43.242
[sighs] Besides,
I think it's growing on me. Liberty.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.830
I think I could make a future
for myself here.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.295
We can contain this.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.797
Nobody here even knows who Winston is.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.716
Except Alex.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.718
Who we absolutely shouldn't tell.

37:01.552 --> 37:02.553
I don't get it.

37:03.429 --> 37:06.307
Monty beat the shit out of him.
Why would Winston go back?

37:06.849 --> 37:07.934
Fuck if I know.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.311
Why would Jess go back with Justin?

37:11.395 --> 37:13.814
All I know is
that they were together that night.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.485
So then, why hasn't he done anything yet?
Why aren't we all in jail already?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.695
Maybe he doesn't have any proof.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.448
Maybe that's why he's here.

37:24.116 --> 37:25.451
To get proof.

37:26.827 --> 37:27.745
[sighs]

37:28.412 --> 37:31.999
-And you said everything was handled.
- You said that Tyler's guns were handled.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.042
They are.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.253
But you don't really believe that, do you?

37:36.295 --> 37:38.881
You knew about this since Thanksgiving,
and you're telling me now?

37:38.965 --> 37:40.299
I was hoping it would go away.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.301
Why didn't you tell me
you were moving to Oakland?

37:42.802 --> 37:44.553
What the fuck?
Why don't you tell me anything?

37:44.637 --> 37:48.140
Because you were falling apart.
Because you were a fucking mess.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.187
Well, I'm fine now.

37:53.813 --> 37:54.814
I'm fine.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.401
Clay.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.282
[distorted sounds]

38:07.743 --> 38:08.786
[exhales] I, um...

38:09.787 --> 38:10.705
I gotta...

38:10.788 --> 38:11.664
Clay!

38:28.139 --> 38:29.682
[gasps, sighs with relief]

38:38.691 --> 38:40.234
[Luke] We had 'em made for today.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.823
-Thanks.
-[Luke] No, you gotta put it on.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.242
-Maybe later.
-[jock] Come on, Estella.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.911
You gotta wear it.
It's the only tribute he's gonna get.

38:52.913 --> 38:54.206
It's sweet, guys, but...

38:55.082 --> 38:58.169
-I'm just gonna wear it at home.
-No, you gotta wear it now.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.253
It's for today.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.842

53:31.833 --> 53:34.252
I raped seven or eight other girls.

53:34.336 --> 53:36.588
Some of them were my girlfriends
at the time.

53:37.130 --> 53:39.174
I'm broken.   I know that.

53:39.758 --> 53:41.927
I'm a person in 1,000 pieces,

53:43.094 --> 53:44.471
but I'm seeing a counselor.

53:45.513 --> 53:48.058
It's a long, hard process, but...

53:48.642 --> 53:52.020
little by little,
you start picking up the pieces.

53:52.103 --> 53:55.565
And the more pieces you put together,
the more you see yourself.

53:57.525 --> 53:58.526
[Clay] What the...

54:01.821 --> 54:03.281
[breathing heavily]

54:10.038 --> 54:10.956
What...

54:11.039 --> 54:12.707
[panting, grunting]

54:18.046 --> 54:20.090
Hey! Hey! Hey!

54:21.049 --> 54:23.009
Hey, hold up!   Hey, what the fuck?

54:29.182 --> 54:31.017
[Mrs. Jensen] Clay?   Clay!

54:32.769 --> 54:34.437
-Clay, are you OK?
- Uh, yeah.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.106
Hey, Mom, I'm fine.

54:43.488 --> 54:44.614
[sighs]

54:51.705 --> 54:54.082
[Clay]  Yeah, I'm so not fine.
