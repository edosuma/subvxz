WEBVTT

00:06.737 --> 00:09.180
GUYS, I NEED TO PREP YOU
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT MISSION,

00:09.180 --> 00:11.042
AND TO DEMONSTRATE, LEO--

00:11.042 --> 00:12.283
ANH-DANH.

00:12.283 --> 00:13.584
MISSION SPECIALIST DOOLEY.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.718
WILL BE ADDING A LITTLE
MORE AUDIO-VISUAL "PIZZAZZLE"

00:17.718 --> 00:19.190
TO THE USUAL SNOOZE-FEST.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.798
HEY, YOU WANT A SHOW?
KICK IN THE DOUGH.

00:27.798 --> 00:31.362
TONIGHT I'M SENDING YOU
TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE.

00:31.362 --> 00:32.662
OH, YOU HEAR THAT, ADAM?

00:32.662 --> 00:34.505
YOU'D BETTER BRING
A BIG BASKET.

00:35.706 --> 00:37.568
LEO.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.670
I WAS SATELLITE-SCOUTING
INDUSTRIAL SITES

00:39.670 --> 00:41.712
WHEN I FOUND THIS WAREHOUSE
THAT I THINK

00:41.712 --> 00:44.075
IS A FRONT FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS.

00:44.075 --> 00:45.816
SEE THESE BARRELS?

00:45.816 --> 00:47.348
THEY'RE FULL
OF TOXIC CHEMICALS.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.749
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE
TO DISPOSE OF PROPERLY,

00:48.749 --> 00:52.453
SO THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST
GONNA DUMP THEM INTO THE SEA.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.626
WHICH COULD HARM OCEAN LIFE
AND OBLITERATE THE COASTLINE.

00:55.626 --> 00:58.389
( Bree laughing )

00:58.389 --> 01:00.231
OWEN, YOU ARE SO SWEET.

01:00.231 --> 01:03.664
YES, I WILL "BREE"
YOUR VALENTINE.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.465
SEE, HE TOOK MY NAME
AND--

01:05.465 --> 01:06.697
YEAH, WE GOT IT.

01:06.697 --> 01:09.370
EVEN I GOT IT.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.642
I DIDN'T GET IT.

01:11.642 --> 01:13.344
WHAT IS GOING ON?

01:13.344 --> 01:15.376
SHE'S TALKING
TO OWEN AGAIN.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.747
HE'S AN ARTIST,
AND HE CLAIMS

01:16.747 --> 01:19.450
THAT BREE
IS HIS MUSE.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.613
WELL, I FOR ONE,
AM NOT A-MUSED.

01:22.613 --> 01:25.786
( plays "Wah-wah-wah" tone )

01:25.786 --> 01:27.658
GIMME THAT!

01:27.658 --> 01:29.660
AND YOU, OFF THE PHONE!

01:29.660 --> 01:31.422
UGH! FINE.

01:31.422 --> 01:32.723
JUST TELL US
WHAT YOU INVENTED,

01:32.723 --> 01:35.596
WHAT WENT WRONG,
AND HOW LONG TILL
IT BLOWS UP.

01:35.596 --> 01:39.600
LOOK, THE POLICE
CANNOT BUST THESE GUYS
WITHOUT EVIDENCE,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.533
SO I NEED YOU
TO SNEAK IN THERE
AND GATHER SAMPLES.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.205
SHOW 'EM THE BARREL.

01:48.239 --> 01:50.611
NOW, THERE'S ONLY
ONE SAFE WAY TO GET
THE SAMPLES,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.713
AND LEO...
 Ahem.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.886
SORRY. MISSION
SPECIALIST DOOLEY

01:55.886 --> 01:57.718
WILL DEMONSTRATE.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.422
FIRST, TAKE THE CANISTER
AND ATTACH IT TO THE SPOUT.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.494
PUSH DOWN
AND TURN 45 DEGREES...

02:03.494 --> 02:07.498
( growling with exertion )
 ...TO CREATE
AN AIRTIGHT SEAL.

02:07.498 --> 02:09.500
THEN PULL THE HANDLE.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.631
( Bree laughing )

02:10.631 --> 02:12.503
LOL, OWEN!

PAY ATTENTION ALL THE TIME?

02:17.468 --> 02:19.440
STRONG. SMART. FAST.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.212
LET'S JUST DO THIS
ALREADY.

02:23.814 --> 02:27.448
BREE, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU?

A FANTASTIC VENDING MACHINE.

03:35.246 --> 03:37.248

03:37.248 --> 03:39.620
IF MR. DAVENPORT FINDS OUT
SHE'S LATE FOR A MISSION,

03:39.620 --> 03:40.851
SHE'S GONNA BE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

HEY, GUYS.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.916
GUESS WHAT.

04:05.916 --> 04:07.778
YOU HAD A COLLISION
WITH A POODLE ON A TRICYCLE

04:07.778 --> 04:09.850
WHO WORKS AT A PAINT STORE.

04:11.782 --> 04:13.484
NO.

OKAY, WHATEVER.
I DON'T GET IT EITHER,

04:22.363 --> 04:24.635
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT HE MADE IT FOR ME.

04:24.635 --> 04:26.467
HEY, HEY, THIS IS SERIOUS.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.769
YOU'RE LATE, AND YOU'RE NOT

I KNOW, BUT THIS IS
NOT A ONE-MAN JOB.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.876
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BRING IN A LIFE COACH.

11:45.876 --> 11:47.878
I HAVE TO GO RESCUE
ADAM AND CHASE.

11:47.878 --> 11:50.240

11:51.842 --> 11:54.184
OF HER CONTAMINATION
WILL MANIFEST.

11:54.184 --> 11:56.116
GO ON YOUR MISSION,
BIG "D."

11:56.116 --> 11:57.788
I GOT THIS.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.723
( Klaxon blares )

12:04.995 --> 12:07.127
I HAD THIS.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.900
( Klaxon blares )

12:17.067 --> 12:18.909
WOW, OWEN,
SO THAT WHOLE MASK

12:18.909 --> 12:20.740
IS MADE OUT OF VIDEO
GAME CONTROLLERS?

12:20.740 --> 12:24.845
YEP. I CALL IT "MASK
MADE OF VIDEO GAME
CONTROLLERS."

12:24.845 --> 12:28.448
IT'S ABOUT FATE
AND HOW TRUE CONTROL
IS A MASQUERADE.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.881
IT ALSO SCARES THE HECK
OUT OF MY MOM.

12:33.483 --> 12:35.085
BREE, WE'VE GOTTA--

12:35.085 --> 12:36.086
AAAHHH!

12:38.058 --> 12:40.060
HEY, I NEED
TO TALK TO BREE.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.393
CAN YOU GO PUT YOUR FACE
ON PAUSE SOMEWHERE?

12:43.393 --> 12:46.136
IN LIFE, AS IN ART,
THERE IS NO PAUSE,

12:46.136 --> 12:48.869
ONLY MOVING FORWARD.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.541
CAN YOU MOVE FORWARD
DOWN THE STAIRS?

12:54.244 --> 12:56.476
THAT'S THE GUY
YOU SNUCK OUT FOR?

12:56.476 --> 13:00.050
REALLY?

13:00.050 --> 13:03.283
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.
BIG "D" NEEDS YOU TO
STAY IN YOUR CAPSULE.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.116
LEO, HE IS OVERREACTING.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.157
I AM PERFECTLY FINE.

13:07.157 --> 13:10.190
SEE? HAVEN'T HAD ONE
SINGLE SIDE EFFECT.

13:12.562 --> 13:14.194
( chuckles )

13:14.194 --> 13:16.426
THAT'S-- THAT'S NOTHING.

13:20.370 --> 13:21.431
SEE?

13:21.431 --> 13:23.573
I AM TRYING
 TO COME OFF CASUAL

13:23.573 --> 13:26.106
SO OWEN DOESN'T SENSE
HOW DESPERATE I AM.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.577
IT'S NOT WORKING.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.913
UH.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.245
I'M GOOD.
( chuckles )

13:38.148 --> 13:39.349
All: OHH!

13:45.996 --> 13:48.298
SEE? THAT IS
PERFORMANCE ART.

13:48.298 --> 13:51.201
I CALL IT "FALLING
UNCONTROLLABLY
DOWN THE STAIRS."

13:55.936 --> 13:57.237
CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING YET?

13:57.237 --> 14:01.071
NOPE, BUT YOU STILL
SOUND SHORT.

14:01.071 --> 14:04.114
SO, WHO TOLD YOU THAT WE
WERE DUMPING CHEMICALS

14:04.114 --> 14:06.176
INTO THE OCEAN TONIGHT?

14:06.176 --> 14:08.919
IT WAS ONLY A HUNCH UNTIL
YOU JUST CONFIRMED IT.

14:08.919 --> 14:10.320
OH, DID I?

14:10.320 --> 14:11.922
YEAH, YOU DID.

14:11.922 --> 14:14.224
OH, DID I?

14:14.224 --> 14:16.256
YES, YOU DID.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.158
OKAY, I GUESS I DID.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.489
HA!

14:19.489 --> 14:21.261
THAT GUARD'S AN IDIOT.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.233
I'M OVER HERE.
 OHH.

14:26.336 --> 14:30.870
( device whirring )

14:33.573 --> 14:36.106
YOU THERE!
RELEASE THEM!

14:36.106 --> 14:38.909
THEY'RE COMING WITH ME!

14:38.909 --> 14:39.950
WHO ARE YOU?

14:39.950 --> 14:41.411
THE BOSS SENT ME IN.

14:41.411 --> 14:45.956
THEY CALL ME...
THE IN-TERROR-GATOR!

14:45.956 --> 14:49.389
( sinister laughter )

14:49.389 --> 14:52.462
WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS,

14:52.462 --> 14:56.366
I. GET. ANSWERS!

15:02.002 --> 15:03.273
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO,

15:03.273 --> 15:05.205
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.506
NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.508
SETTLE DOWN, PUNK!

15:08.508 --> 15:10.210
It's me, Davenport!

15:10.210 --> 15:12.142
Just follow my lead!

15:14.914 --> 15:17.347
OH, THAT HURTS!

15:17.347 --> 15:19.149
HEY, I CAN SEE!

15:19.149 --> 15:21.952
YOU LIAR!
YOU'RE NOT DAVENPORT!

15:26.526 --> 15:28.298
HELLO.

15:28.298 --> 15:30.000
( gasps )

15:30.000 --> 15:31.301
I TOLD YOU HE'S A WITCH!

15:31.301 --> 15:34.504
I'm not a witch!
I was wearing a cyber mask!

15:34.504 --> 15:36.366
STOP THEM!

15:58.588 --> 16:01.191
( gas hissing )

16:01.191 --> 16:03.693
( all coughing )

16:03.693 --> 16:06.096
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER
WITH SAFETY BRIEFS?

16:06.096 --> 16:09.069
( laughing )
UNDERWEAR!

16:10.340 --> 16:11.671
RUN!

16:22.012 --> 16:24.684
BREE, DAVENPORT'S
GONNA FREAK OUT.
WE HAVE TO GO.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.516
LEO, I CAN'T EVEN
STAND UP.

16:26.516 --> 16:28.618
EVERYTHING IS NUMB.
LOOK!

16:34.094 --> 16:37.067
JUST HELP ME
GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE IT GETS "WORTH."

16:37.067 --> 16:39.699
IT'S "WORTH"!

16:39.699 --> 16:41.301
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.433
( lisping )
THE NUMBNESS SPREAD
TO MY TONGUE!

16:43.433 --> 16:45.275
I CAN'T TALK!

16:47.037 --> 16:49.579
FINALLY, A POSITIVE
SIDE EFFECT.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.181
LEO!

16:52.512 --> 16:56.116
LET'S GET YOU UP.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.247
HERE WE GO.

16:57.247 --> 16:58.588
HERE WE GO.

16:58.588 --> 17:01.391
( coughing )

17:02.692 --> 17:04.054
OKAY.

17:04.054 --> 17:05.155
ONCE WE GET OUTSIDE,

17:05.155 --> 17:07.156
I'LL UPGRADE YOU TO
A NICE SHOPPING CART.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.127
HOW'S THAT?

17:08.127 --> 17:10.300
BREE!

17:10.300 --> 17:11.631
THERE YOU ARE.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.464
I'M ABOUT TO UNVEIL
THE CENTERPIECE

17:14.464 --> 17:15.704
OF MY EXHIBIT.

17:15.704 --> 17:17.307
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:17.307 --> 17:19.309
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:19.309 --> 17:21.441
SHE'S FINE.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.242
YOUR ART IS JUST SO GOOD,

17:23.242 --> 17:26.346
SHE'S GETTING...
EMOTIONAL.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.448
( lisping )
THAT'S GOOD, LEO,
THAT'S GOOD.

17:28.448 --> 17:32.682
COME ON. I'VE BEEN
WAITING ALL NIGHT
TO SHOW YOU THIS.

17:32.682 --> 17:35.755
I WASN'T KIDDING
WHEN I SAID THAT
YOU WERE MY MUSE.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.327
YOU'VE INSPIRED ME
TO CREATE

17:37.327 --> 17:40.130
MY MOST
DEEPLY MEANINGFUL
PIECE YET.

17:40.130 --> 17:44.164
I CALL IT "MY MOST
DEEPLY MEANINGFUL
PIECE YET."

17:45.365 --> 17:46.536
WHOA.

17:49.139 --> 17:51.141
THAT'S NOT
TOTALLY HORRIBLE.

17:51.141 --> 17:53.643
WHAT IS IT?
 IT'S PAINTBALL ART:

17:53.643 --> 17:56.276
TWO THOUSAND PAINTBALLS
FIRED WITH PRECISE ACCURACY

17:56.276 --> 17:59.209
TO CREATE A PORTRAIT
OF YOUR SISTER.

17:59.209 --> 18:02.352
IT'S ABOUT BEAUTY,
INSPIRING MANKIND

18:02.352 --> 18:05.755
TO REPURPOSE THE TOOLS
OF PSEUDO-VIOLENCE AS ART.

18:05.755 --> 18:08.618
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, BREE?

18:08.618 --> 18:09.759
HUH?

18:09.759 --> 18:11.421
BREE?

18:11.421 --> 18:15.125
( indistinct,
thick-tongued response )

18:16.626 --> 18:18.668
SHE HAD THE SAME REACTION
TO THE MONA LISA.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.772
WELL, WE HAVE TO GO.

18:22.772 --> 18:24.604
UNH-UNH.
 UH-HUH.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.576
UNH-UNH.
 UH-HUH!

18:26.576 --> 18:29.309
MNH-MNH!
 UH-HUH!

18:29.309 --> 18:31.311
AAH!

18:31.311 --> 18:33.413
( Bree gasping )

18:33.413 --> 18:36.146
YEAH, THAT'S ENOUGH,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:36.146 --> 18:37.447
COME ON.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.257
WE'LL TAKE IT!

18:54.164 --> 18:55.365
BYE, OWEN!

19:00.810 --> 19:03.142
OKAY, LET'S JUST GET YOU
BACK IN YOUR CAPSULE

19:03.142 --> 19:06.316
BEFORE WE BOTH GET
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

19:06.316 --> 19:08.178
( comical shriek )

19:09.279 --> 19:11.621
CLEANUP, AISLE BREE.

19:11.621 --> 19:14.724
LEO, YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO WATCH HER!

19:14.724 --> 19:16.155
OH, I'M SORRY.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.627
SOMEHOW THE FASTEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD

19:17.627 --> 19:19.229
MANAGED TO SNEAK PAST ME.

19:21.231 --> 19:23.893
LET'S HOPE THERE'S
ENOUGH TIME LEFT FOR
THE ANTIDOTE TO WORK.

19:25.795 --> 19:28.238
BREE, ARE YOU OKAY?

19:28.238 --> 19:29.699
( groans )

19:29.699 --> 19:31.541
I FEEL FUNNY.

19:31.541 --> 19:32.942
FUNNY.

19:32.942 --> 19:34.604
FUN-NAY.

19:34.604 --> 19:38.848
FUNNY... FUNNY...
 OH, JUST SPIT IT
OUT ALREADY!

19:38.848 --> 19:40.580
I'M CURED!

19:40.580 --> 19:42.912
OH! THIS IS SUCH
A RELIEF!

19:42.912 --> 19:45.355
IT'LL BE SO MUCH MORE
ENJOYABLE TO PUNISH YOU

19:45.355 --> 19:46.956
NOW THAT YOU'RE HEALTHY!

19:48.558 --> 19:51.361
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
YOU COULD HAVE PUT US
ALL IN DANGER!

19:51.361 --> 19:52.592
SORRY.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.264
I JUST WANTED TO BE
LIKE EVERY OTHER GIRL

19:54.264 --> 19:56.195
AND HANG OUT WITH
THE BOY THAT I LIKE.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.327
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

19:57.327 --> 20:01.301
THE BIG DEAL IS YOU'RE
NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER GIRL.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.303
YOU'RE PART OF A TEAM,

20:03.303 --> 20:06.236
AND YOUR DECISIONS
AFFECT US ALL.

20:06.236 --> 20:08.538
YEAH. BECAUSE OF YOU,
I HAD TO GO TO AN ART SHOW.

20:09.839 --> 20:11.281
YEAH!

20:11.281 --> 20:14.244
AND I HAVEN'T EATEN
SINCE 2:30!

20:14.244 --> 20:16.846
ALSO, ON A LESSER NOTE,

20:16.846 --> 20:19.218
WE ALL COULD
HAVE BEEN KILLED!

20:20.219 --> 20:22.392
LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE
A SOCIAL LIFE.

20:22.392 --> 20:24.994
JUST DON'T LET IT INTERFERE
WITH YOUR BIONIC LIFE.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.696
I GET IT.

20:26.696 --> 20:28.358
FROM NOW ON WHEN
A MISSION COMES UP,

20:28.358 --> 20:29.959
IT GETS
MY FULL ATTENTION.

20:29.959 --> 20:33.303
OKAY, WELL, I THINK
WE'VE ALL LEARNED
A VALUABLE LESSON,

20:33.303 --> 20:34.904
SO LET'S JUST GO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

20:34.904 --> 20:37.837
WHADDYA SAY? ALL RIGHT?
LET'S DO THIS!

20:37.837 --> 20:40.239
( groans )

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242
OH. FORGOT TO MENTION,
MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE WHILE

20:43.242 --> 20:45.244
FOR THE ANTIDOTE TO GET
TO THE REST OF HER BODY,

20:45.244 --> 20:46.416
SO EVERYBODY GRAB A LIMB.

20:46.416 --> 20:47.747
ONE OF HER LIMBS, ADAM.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.918
THANK YOU.

20:56.786 --> 20:58.027
AND EVEN AFTER ALL OF THAT,

20:58.027 --> 21:00.830
HE STILL WANTS
TO HANG OUT WITH ME!

21:00.830 --> 21:04.764
I DON'T CARE!

21:04.764 --> 21:08.598
WELL, EVEN THOUGH
YOU FAILED YOUR MISSION,

21:08.598 --> 21:10.940
THE COPS HEARD THE ALARMS
AND PICKED UP THOSE
ECO VILLAINS,

21:10.940 --> 21:14.904
SO THE OCEAN IS SAFE
THANKS TO ALL OF...

21:14.904 --> 21:17.477
ME, ACTUALLY.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.609
WELL, I GUESS
WE GOT LUCKY.

21:19.609 --> 21:20.910
LUCK. SKILL.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.282
I SAY WE JUST PUT
THIS WHOLE THING BEHIND US.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.984
( chuckling ) OR--

21:24.984 --> 21:27.687
I COULD PUNISH YOU
FOR ALL THE STUPID
THINGS YOU DID

21:27.687 --> 21:29.859
BY MAKING YOU
SWEEP THE LAB.

21:29.859 --> 21:31.861
( sinister laughter )

21:33.623 --> 21:34.864
GUYS, COME ON!

21:34.864 --> 21:36.996
