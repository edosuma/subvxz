08:16.322 --> 08:17.522
Then you fell
on top of me

08:17.523 --> 08:19.126
and changed the shape
of my skeleton forever.

08:19.127 --> 08:22.095
No, I definitely want one.

08:22.096 --> 08:25.264
That was the drugs talking.
I was high as a kite.

08:28.457 --> 08:32.806
Did I do this and call you "tiny head?"
Yes.

08:32.807 --> 08:34.563
Some things are
coming back to me now.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.009
Oh, that's great.

08:36.010 --> 08:37.878
<i>[Terry laughs]
Tiny head.</i>

08:37.879 --> 08:40.246
Jake, I am so scared
that man is about to make

08:40.248 --> 08:43.283
a huge mistake,
re: His vas deferens.

08:43.284 --> 08:46.253
I know, he made me promise
to not let him get that surgery.

08:46.254 --> 08:49.323
And it wasn't just the drugs.
He doesn't want this.

08:49.324 --> 08:52.749
As his friend,
it's my job to stop him.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.063
[Back cracks,
groans in pain]

08:56.064 --> 08:59.700
Sorry, Terry turned my spine
into a loose stack of pebbles.

08:59.701 --> 09:03.203
And since my arrival,
violent crime has gone down

09:03.204 --> 09:06.873
by 17.3%,
as you can see here.

09:06.874 --> 09:09.176
<i>Two-toned graphs?</i>

09:09.177 --> 09:11.411
You think you can distract me
from the precinct's problems

09:11.412 --> 09:13.311
with a flashy presentation?

09:13.377 --> 09:15.480
<i>Same old Ray Holt.</i>

09:15.546 --> 09:17.517
All sizzle, no steak.

09:17.518 --> 09:19.567
<i>I'm off to do
some spot-checks.</i>

09:21.189 --> 09:23.557
Oh, my God.
She's totally gonna flunk us.

09:23.558 --> 09:24.958
I haven't gotten an "F"

09:24.959 --> 09:26.827
since I failed recess
in second grade.

09:26.828 --> 09:28.595
"Teachers need a break too,
Amy."

09:28.596 --> 09:31.865
We were doomed the minute
she slithered into the precinct.

09:31.866 --> 09:34.457
<i>It's funny.
When we first met,</i>

09:34.469 --> 09:36.235
we had some good times.

09:38.890 --> 09:40.790
Looks like we both want
that stapler.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.559
Seems that way
based on what happened.

09:43.073 --> 09:46.496
[Both laughing]

09:46.497 --> 09:48.398
<i>So when did it all
go south?</i>

09:48.399 --> 09:51.468
1989. I was up
for a big promotion,

09:51.469 --> 09:53.336
which would've fast-tracked
my career.

09:53.337 --> 09:54.905
<i>Wuntch offered to write
a letter on my behalf</i>

09:54.906 --> 09:57.874
but instead, she torpedoed me
because of something

09:57.875 --> 10:00.576
that happened the night before
she was to turn it in.

10:01.679 --> 10:02.678
Madeline.

10:05.483 --> 10:06.483
Would you care for a drink?

10:06.484 --> 10:07.651
I'd love one.

10:07.652 --> 10:09.719
I'm sure you can tell
I'm quite drunk.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.589
I've had a couple
to build up the nerve.

10:12.590 --> 10:15.759
I think we both know
what I'm about to say.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.375
Raymond...

10:17.441 --> 10:19.762
I don't think
we need to say anything.

10:23.868 --> 10:24.924
I'm gay.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.470
That's what I was
going to tell you.

10:27.471 --> 10:29.095
Well, then.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.274
She sabotaged my career

10:31.275 --> 10:34.267
because I refused
to bed her.

10:35.978 --> 10:38.414
He thinks I stabbed him?
That's crazy.

10:38.415 --> 10:40.850
He said you were furious
at him because he banned you

10:40.851 --> 10:42.886
from the restaurant
and called your business plans

10:42.887 --> 10:43.887
"terrible."

10:43.888 --> 10:45.321
The text reads:

10:45.322 --> 10:48.791
"Your ideas are dumb-dumb
batter in a stupid pancake,

10:48.792 --> 10:52.128
you steaming pile
of human fences."

10:52.129 --> 10:54.931
I assume that was
auto-corrected from "feces."

10:54.932 --> 10:58.134
Look, partners fight.
He's difficult to work with,

10:58.135 --> 11:00.084
but I would never try
and kill him.

11:00.150 --> 11:02.605
Where were you on monday
around 10:00 pm?

11:02.606 --> 11:04.174
Me and my business school
buddies get together

11:04.175 --> 11:06.309
every monday and have
a couple beers.

11:06.310 --> 11:08.278
Also, there's a... uh...
Pilates studio

11:08.279 --> 11:09.646
with a huge window
across the street

11:09.647 --> 11:13.149
so it's a pretty sweet view.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.784
I guess that's not as bad
as stabbing someone?

11:14.785 --> 11:16.586
I left around 10:00,

11:16.587 --> 11:18.621
I took the subway home,
got off at York street,

11:18.622 --> 11:20.223
around my house,
puked on a statue,

11:20.224 --> 11:21.272
went to bed.

11:21.338 --> 11:22.992
Classy.
All right, well,

11:22.993 --> 11:24.460
we've taken up
enough of your time

11:24.461 --> 11:26.496
enjoy the rest of your day
and go back to your life

11:26.497 --> 11:28.279
as "a pile
of human fences."

11:28.345 --> 11:30.166
Okay, let's see if
any of DRK MLK's neighbors

11:30.167 --> 11:31.634
saw the pilates perv
or anyone else

11:31.635 --> 11:33.436
fleeing the scene
of the crime.

11:33.437 --> 11:34.804
Copy that.

11:34.805 --> 11:36.239
We'll do some cop stuff,
have a heart-to-heart

11:36.240 --> 11:37.307
about your vasectomy,
cancel your vasectomy,

11:37.308 --> 11:38.441
grab some drinks,
laugh about the time

11:38.442 --> 11:40.476
you almost got
a vasectomy.

11:40.477 --> 11:42.545
Stop worrying about
my vasectomy, man.

11:42.546 --> 11:44.447
<i>Maybe you should focus
on your own body.</i>

11:44.448 --> 11:45.848
When's the last time
you had a carrot?

11:45.849 --> 11:48.551
Well, it's my least favorite
type of cake, so rarely.

11:48.552 --> 11:50.787
If I absolutely have to,
I'll just eat the frosting.

11:50.788 --> 11:52.855
Hey!
Cut it out, cake boy.

11:52.856 --> 11:54.357
You're making health
insurance more expensive

11:54.358 --> 11:55.792
for everyone else!

11:55.793 --> 11:56.793
Yeah?
Well, you know what else

11:56.794 --> 11:58.127
drives up premiums?

11:58.128 --> 12:00.129
Unwanted genital removal!

12:00.130 --> 12:01.646
[Door opens]

12:01.712 --> 12:03.800
[Sighs in relief]
Thank you for coming.

12:03.801 --> 12:04.934
I wasn't sure
if you'd get my message.

12:04.935 --> 12:06.602
Charles, it was kind
of hard to miss.

12:07.471 --> 12:09.904
<i>Oh, God!</i>

12:09.970 --> 12:11.441
Hey, I didn't know
what to do.

12:11.442 --> 12:12.475
You said we weren't
allowed to talk at work

12:12.476 --> 12:14.033
now that we're
knocking boots.

12:14.099 --> 12:15.278
Ew, gross.

12:15.279 --> 12:17.447
Listen,
my ex-wife's throwing

12:17.448 --> 12:18.681
an engagement party
this weekend

12:18.682 --> 12:20.783
and I was wondering
if you wanted to go...

12:20.784 --> 12:22.185
As friends.

12:22.186 --> 12:25.855
No, Charles, just because
we have secret, shameful sex

12:25.856 --> 12:27.797
does not mean
we are friends.

12:27.863 --> 12:29.892
Forget friends.
Let's go as "bone bros."

12:29.893 --> 12:31.394
Ugh!

12:31.395 --> 12:33.763
I didn't strike you when
you said "knocking boots,"

12:33.764 --> 12:38.668
but "bone bros"?
I cannot abide.

12:38.669 --> 12:40.560
Have you seen this man
around DRK MLK.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.538
Oh, I don't go there.

12:42.539 --> 12:44.188
They don't allow babies
in there.

12:44.254 --> 12:45.875
What is wrong with them?

12:45.876 --> 12:48.144
All I drank when I was a baby
was chocolate milk.

12:48.145 --> 12:49.736
Well, thank you
for your time.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.614
<i>And thank you,
adorable little baby,</i>

12:51.615 --> 12:52.949
who's probably
giving my partner

12:52.950 --> 12:54.817
some mixed feelings
right about now.

12:54.818 --> 12:56.853
"Don't get the operation,
sarge!

12:56.854 --> 12:59.255
Instead, make a tiny muscular
friend for me to play with!"

12:59.256 --> 13:00.456
That's enough.

13:00.457 --> 13:01.457
I'm with you.
That's enough, baby.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.833
Mind your own business.

13:03.899 --> 13:06.396
<i>I haven't heard of DRK MLK</i>

13:06.397 --> 13:08.197
and I've never seen
this man before.

13:08.198 --> 13:10.533
This is your lead?
Why are we here?

13:10.534 --> 13:12.335
Well, according
to the Internet,

13:12.336 --> 13:14.404
Dr. Mindel is the best
couples counselor

13:14.405 --> 13:15.672
in the Park slope area,

13:15.673 --> 13:16.806
who accepts same day
walk-ins.

13:16.807 --> 13:18.274
<i>Couples counseling?</i>

13:18.275 --> 13:19.742
Sorry for wasting your time.

13:19.743 --> 13:21.559
Wait, please don't leave.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.647
This cost me so much money.
[Door closes]

13:24.648 --> 13:26.314
I am so sorry.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.484
He's walking out.

13:28.485 --> 13:29.901
Just like your father did.

13:29.967 --> 13:31.954
Wait a minute,
I didn't tell you about that.

13:31.955 --> 13:33.289
Didn't have to.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.426
You are good!

13:36.427 --> 13:40.244
Sarge, wait up!
Come on, don't be mad!

13:40.310 --> 13:41.864
Look, I'm only trying
to protect you

13:41.865 --> 13:43.599
from your very stupid self.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.335
That is
enough, Jake!

13:45.336 --> 13:46.869
Look, I'm sorry,
okay?

13:46.870 --> 13:48.304
And the things you said
when you were whacked-out

13:48.305 --> 13:49.439
were real.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.974
You made me promise.
And as your friend...

13:51.975 --> 13:53.176
I told you, Jake.

13:53.177 --> 13:54.744
We're not that kind
of friends.

13:54.745 --> 13:56.646
Not what kind of friends?

13:56.647 --> 13:57.680
"Friend" friends.

13:57.681 --> 13:59.263
You and I
are work friends.

13:59.329 --> 14:01.432
Now, if you will
excuse me,

14:01.498 --> 14:03.810
I'm going
to the doctor's office.

14:05.556 --> 14:07.590
Not good enough.

14:07.591 --> 14:08.958
Prepare to be physically
overpowered

14:08.959 --> 14:10.960
by a "friend" friend.

14:10.961 --> 14:12.109
Argh!

14:12.175 --> 14:14.464
Cancel the appointment!
I've got you!

14:14.465 --> 14:15.965
You can't move.

14:15.966 --> 14:18.115
Concede defeat, sir.

14:18.181 --> 14:20.235
You have been conquered.

14:21.018 --> 14:22.668
<i>(Madeline)
Spot-checks are done.</i>

14:22.669 --> 14:24.870
Needless to say,
I thoroughly underwhelmed.

14:24.871 --> 14:26.071
Huh.
From your expression,

14:26.072 --> 14:29.508
I would've guessed
constipated or chilly.

14:29.509 --> 14:31.610
Excuse me, captain,
I don't want to say

14:31.611 --> 14:35.380
that I saved the day,
but I will because I did.

14:35.381 --> 14:37.249
So...

14:37.250 --> 14:41.185
The letter of recommendation
<i>she</i> wrote for you 25 years ago.

14:42.646 --> 14:43.779
Where'd you get this?

14:43.780 --> 14:45.181
I just went down
to one police plaza

14:45.182 --> 14:47.883
and applied some
of my signature Amy charm.

14:47.884 --> 14:49.151
And then
when you wouldn't stop,

14:49.152 --> 14:50.352
they just gave it to you?

14:50.353 --> 14:52.154
More or less.

14:52.155 --> 14:54.390
The point is,
the letter's very positive.

14:54.391 --> 14:56.625
You thought she wrote
mean stuff about you

14:56.626 --> 14:59.428
because of the...
Night before.

14:59.429 --> 15:01.964
But she didn't.
It was all a misunderstanding.

15:01.965 --> 15:03.632
<i>(Madeline)
Wait a minute...</i>

15:04.102 --> 15:06.602
You thought I cost you that
promotion because you're gay?

15:06.603 --> 15:09.408
That's what you've been mad
about all these years?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.744
It's... one reason.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.980
I don't care that
you rejected my advances.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.915
Your sexual identity
is the one thing

15:15.916 --> 15:17.950
I actually respect
about you.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.785
Then what are you
mad about?

15:19.786 --> 15:22.955
I'm mad because you tried
to get me thrown off the force.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.257
Yeah, because you shot me.

15:24.258 --> 15:27.193
I shot you because you were
in the wrong position.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.628
You weren't
following orders.

15:28.629 --> 15:30.429
What about the time you
destroyed my personnel file

15:30.430 --> 15:31.430
while I was undercover?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.632
What if there
had been a mole?

15:32.633 --> 15:34.000
You were trying
to make me disappear.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.002
You embarrassed me
in front of Derek Jeter!

15:36.003 --> 15:41.657
You embarrassed yourself
in front of Derek Jeter.

15:46.269 --> 15:47.496
<i>(Charles)
Hey, Rosa!</i>

15:47.562 --> 15:51.334
Better file me under "E"
for "edgy."

15:51.400 --> 15:53.419
- What?
- Cornrows!

15:53.485 --> 15:54.720
Why?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.189
My ex-wife and her fiance
go to Jamaica all the time.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.992
The theme of their party is:
"Jamaican me marry you."

15:59.993 --> 16:01.227
So good!

16:01.228 --> 16:02.561
<i>So...</i>

16:02.562 --> 16:04.897
I still don't have a date.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.183
Unless this sweet maize-head
has changed your mind.

16:07.249 --> 16:08.834
I think we both know
it hasn't.

16:08.835 --> 16:09.835
We do.
[Clears throat]

16:09.836 --> 16:10.978
Fair enough.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.005
[Exhales deeply]

16:13.006 --> 16:14.307
Why do you look so terrible?

16:14.308 --> 16:16.976
I tried to stop sarge
from getting his tubes tied.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.412
But he somehow managed to
sneak off to the hospital.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.280
Zip that lip!
He's doing it?

16:21.281 --> 16:23.516
He wouldn't listen to me.
He said I was a "work friend."

16:23.517 --> 16:26.919
Ah, that chills me.
And it reminds me of a story.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.621
I had this sweater,
and it was a work sweater

16:28.622 --> 16:30.790
because it only seemed
work apropes,

16:30.856 --> 16:33.726
but then one time,
I wore it out to dinner

16:33.727 --> 16:36.162
and I was like,
"oh, dang!

16:36.163 --> 16:38.172
This sweater is cute
everywhere."

16:39.132 --> 16:41.509
I get it.
I'm the sweater.

16:41.575 --> 16:42.535
No.

16:42.536 --> 16:43.536
And I have to show the sarge
I can be a good friend

16:43.537 --> 16:45.004
to him outside
of work too.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.005
No!

16:46.006 --> 16:47.006
Thank you, Gina.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.341
I'm gonna stop him.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.408
Jake, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

16:49.409 --> 16:50.743
but good luck!

16:50.744 --> 16:53.270
Well, good-bye, Raymond.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.897
Anything you'd like
to say to me

16:54.915 --> 16:56.357
before I complete
my evaluation?

16:56.423 --> 16:58.551
Something in the form
of groveling?

16:58.552 --> 17:01.821
Never.
Fail me if you must.

17:05.348 --> 17:07.560
You're just gonna let her
fail us?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.362
I'm sorry about your
precious grade, Santiago,

17:09.363 --> 17:11.329
but this isn't
about you.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.932
Don't "this isn't
about you" me!

17:12.933 --> 17:15.867
I'm "this isn't
about you"-ing you!

17:15.868 --> 17:18.204
That grade is the only thing
standing between me

17:18.204 --> 17:20.205
and a future where you're
not my captain anymore.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.758
Wuntch failed the nine-oh
and their captain was fired.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.944
I attempted to cajole her
but she rebuffed me.

17:25.945 --> 17:29.048
I'm not a man
of unlimited cajoling.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.952
Well, you better become one
because I need you in command.

17:32.953 --> 17:35.755
This precinct needs you
in command.

17:35.756 --> 17:38.590
Cajole up,
captain.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.233
Sarge, hey!

17:47.234 --> 17:50.870
What the hell
are you doing here, tiny head?

17:51.338 --> 17:55.207
You better not be trying to talk
me out of my surgery again.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.742
Look, I'm not trying to
talk you out of anything.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.444
I'm just here to give you
a ride home

17:58.445 --> 18:00.279
and to prove to you
once and for all

18:00.280 --> 18:02.448
that I'm more than
just a work friend.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.750
Thank you,
microscope head.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.985
Hey, a little bit of
good news!

18:05.986 --> 18:07.153
I figured out the case!

18:07.154 --> 18:08.487
Remember Gregory
said he got off

18:08.488 --> 18:10.122
at the York street station
the night of the stabbing?

18:10.123 --> 18:11.223
Well, I took the subway here

18:11.224 --> 18:12.858
and it's closed for
construction.

18:12.859 --> 18:13.859
Hmm...

18:13.860 --> 18:15.961
So what you're saying is...

18:15.962 --> 18:17.963
I stabbed him.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.231
I did it.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.108
You know what?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

18:21.174 --> 18:23.435
See you on the other side.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.741
<i>Jake,
you were right!</i>

18:28.742 --> 18:31.210
<i>I don't want the surger,
tiny head!</i>

18:31.211 --> 18:32.244
NYPD!

18:32.310 --> 18:33.646
Put down the scalpel
and step away

18:33.647 --> 18:35.380
from my work friend's
weiner-tubes!

18:36.656 --> 18:39.085
Looking good, Boyle!

18:39.151 --> 18:40.735
Ugh, that's not
a good sign.

18:40.736 --> 18:42.864
<i>Hey, mon.</i>

18:42.865 --> 18:45.433
Rosa...
You changed your mind!

18:45.434 --> 18:47.035
I blew off my date,
and instead,

18:47.036 --> 18:48.403
I'm going to spend
a hellish evening

18:48.404 --> 18:50.205
in a Jamaican torture
chamber with you.

18:50.206 --> 18:51.606
Really?
Yeah.

18:51.607 --> 18:53.441
Here's what's about
to happen.

18:53.442 --> 18:54.776
We're gonna go
to this terrible party,

18:54.777 --> 18:56.110
I'm gonna laugh
at all your jokes,

18:56.111 --> 18:57.545
gonna talk about your
medal of valor,

18:57.546 --> 18:59.247
and I'm gonna make you look
like a Jamaican God of rhythm.

18:59.248 --> 19:00.715
Sebastian from
<i>the little mermaid.</i>

19:00.716 --> 19:03.551
Also, tomorrow,
I'm gonna help you find

19:03.552 --> 19:04.568
a new apartment.

19:04.684 --> 19:06.788
You can't live in your
ex-wife's basement anymore.

19:06.789 --> 19:09.240
Wow!
Respect, mon.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.926
I'm gonna read you
my toast in the car.

19:11.927 --> 19:13.027
You're giving a toast?

19:13.028 --> 19:14.028
More like
we're giving a toast.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.162
[Groans]

19:17.132 --> 19:18.132
<i>(Jake)
There we go.</i>

19:18.133 --> 19:19.917
Jake, I have to tell you
something.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.302
Oh, boy.

19:21.303 --> 19:24.505
I am a little conflicted
about having a vasectomy.

19:24.571 --> 19:25.673
Really?

19:25.674 --> 19:27.575
Is that why you threw
an EKG machine at the doctor?

19:27.576 --> 19:30.211
I'm sorry I thought of you
as a work friend.

19:30.212 --> 19:33.556
You're here, man.
You're a <i> friend</i> friend.

19:33.622 --> 19:38.720
You made Terry get real
with himself and his genitals.

19:38.721 --> 19:44.592
Your tiny head has
a big heart inside it.

19:44.593 --> 19:46.060
I know that's
scientifically wrong,

19:46.061 --> 19:47.570
but thanks, sarge.

19:48.063 --> 19:51.966
I'm gonna talk to my wife
when she comes home.

19:51.967 --> 19:55.119
You're a huggy good friend.

19:55.185 --> 19:57.137
No! Not again.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.875
Santiago,
we received our grade.

20:00.876 --> 20:05.213
Oh, my God.
Is this good-bye?

20:05.214 --> 20:07.081
There's still so much
I have to say to you.

20:07.082 --> 20:10.418
2.7.
Mediocre.

20:10.419 --> 20:12.854
But enough for
you to stick around.

20:12.855 --> 20:15.056
How did you get her
to change her mind?

20:15.057 --> 20:17.141
I had to compromise
everything I stand for.

20:17.207 --> 20:19.427
You are now,
and always have been,

20:19.428 --> 20:21.429
the superior
police officer.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.465
And?

20:24.466 --> 20:27.568
The Derek Jeter thing
was my fault.

20:27.634 --> 20:29.370
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

20:29.371 --> 20:30.505
No, you were right.

20:30.506 --> 20:31.673
This is the best job
I've ever had

20:31.674 --> 20:33.374
and it would be foolish
to give it up

20:33.375 --> 20:35.710
over a petty feud.

20:35.711 --> 20:38.479
Here, this is
for you.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.615
It's a grade for your
performance these past few days.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.209
A letter grade, so as
to not be "weird" about it.

20:43.719 --> 20:47.155
Oh, my God.
You really shouldn't have.

20:47.156 --> 20:49.390
An "a."

20:49.391 --> 20:50.925
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:50.991 --> 20:53.344
Just curious,
does your system have pluses

20:53.410 --> 20:56.597
in it, or is, like,
"a" the highest?

20:58.901 --> 21:00.802
How'd the interrogation go?

21:00.803 --> 21:03.104
Gregory confessed
to the stabbing.

21:03.105 --> 21:05.039
Nice work.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.574
I just talked to my wife.

21:06.575 --> 21:09.444
We're waiting on the operation,
everything's cool.

21:09.445 --> 21:11.379
Did you tell her
we slept together twice?

21:11.380 --> 21:15.917
Thanks for taking care of me.
I got you a present.

21:15.918 --> 21:18.019
Do you know what
a present is, Terry?

21:18.020 --> 21:20.121
I care about my friends.

21:20.122 --> 21:23.524
Now eat your carrots, or I'll
rip your tiny head off.

21:23.525 --> 21:24.959
No! No! No!

21:24.960 --> 21:25.960
Come here.

21:25.961 --> 21:27.628
[Gags]

21:27.629 --> 21:29.515
I hate being friends
with you!
