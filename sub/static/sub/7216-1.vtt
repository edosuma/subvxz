WEBVTT

00:23.399 --> 00:27.944
O Savior of China,

00:29.905 --> 00:34.867
you have ennobled the House of Fa.

00:35.911 --> 00:41.082
In gratitude, we honor you.

00:41.166 --> 00:46.462
All veneration to you, O mighty. . .

00:46.672 --> 00:48.589
Say it. Say my name.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.383
Mushu.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.928
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.639
Hey, how you doing up there, man?
Thanks for the intro.

00:57.808 --> 01:02.311
And now I think I'd like
to visit my beloved pedestal.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.191
Let's get it over with.

01:11.447 --> 01:14.866
Ceremonial robe of honor.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.327
If Mulan could see me now.

01:29.673 --> 01:34.552
Mulan saves China one time,
and now he thinks he's the emperor.

01:36.180 --> 01:40.016
I'm climbing a stairway to heaven.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.561
Top floor.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.355
Pedestals, perks and props.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.357
Ceremonial bath of honor.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.615
Yeah.
Y'all better take a deep breath now,

01:55.699 --> 02:00.995
because I ain't leaving my pedestal
for the next thousand years.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.082
Let the whirlpool begin.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.505
Oh, yeah.

03:17.114 --> 03:21.576
According to this chart,
I put the coins here.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.288
Relax, child.

03:25.372 --> 03:30.126
The spirits tell me Shang will arrive and
propose to Mulan before the sun sets.

03:30.502 --> 03:33.170
There's still time to get in on the pool.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.298
Mother.

03:35.382 --> 03:39.719
Gambling is like playing mah-jongg
with blank tiles.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.513
No one really wins.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.563
I'm enriched by your presence, my son.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.483
I think I'll go pray.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.032
Hello, Sha-Ron.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.702
-Is Fa Mulan here?
-Why, she's out in the field.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.080
Yeah, doing her chores.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.417
I'll go help her.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.294
Thank you.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.758
The children all love Mulan.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.426
And why not?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.346
She's strong, she's brave,
she's beautiful.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.934
She's a chip off the old block.

04:31.563 --> 04:49.455
Hi-ya!

04:50.874 --> 04:51.916
Hiya.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.628
It's okay, Little Brother.
What's going on here?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.880
We wanna be like you, Fa Mulan.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.049
Ya! Ya! Hi-ya!

05:02.302 --> 05:04.261
But I'm still learning myself.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.722
-Please?
-Teach us, Mulan.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.059
-Show us.
-Okay. I guess I can show a few moves.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.812
Mulan's gonna teach us
how to kick butt.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.985
Hold it. Calm down.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.153
That's lesson number two.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.991
The first and most important lesson
is to be gentle

05:25.075 --> 05:27.660
at the same time we're being tough.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.829
How can you be tough and gentle?

05:29.913 --> 05:32.331
Yeah, I wanna be tough.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.541
Yeah !

05:33.625 --> 05:36.585
I know it does sound a little funny.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.631
But the world is full of opposites,
and so are you.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.552
To be a good warrior,
you must bring it all into balance.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.098
Let's see if this helps.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.685
Earth, sky, day, night.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.812
Sound and silence.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.856
Dark and light.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.316
One aIone is not enough

05:59.943 --> 06:02.611
You need both together

06:02.696 --> 06:07.616
Winter, summer
Moon and Sun

06:09.453 --> 06:11.120
Lesson number one

06:14.583 --> 06:17.960
Like a rock
You must be hard

06:18.295 --> 06:22.006
Like an oak
You must stand firm

06:22.090 --> 06:23.466
Cut quick

06:23.550 --> 06:25.760
Like my blade

06:25.844 --> 06:27.386
Think fast

06:27.471 --> 06:30.264
Unafraid

06:31.516 --> 06:35.352
Like a rock
I must be hard

06:35.437 --> 06:38.981
Like an oak
I must stand firm

06:39.066 --> 06:40.649
Cut quick

06:40.734 --> 06:42.568
Like my blade

06:42.652 --> 06:44.403
Think fast

06:44.488 --> 06:46.697
Unafraid

06:47.365 --> 06:48.991
Okay, Mulan, I'm ready.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.619
But you're still out of balance.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.412
You're only halfway there.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.416
Like a cIoud
You are soft

06:57.501 --> 07:01.337
Like bamboo
You bend in the wind

07:01.421 --> 07:05.591
Creeping sIow
You're at peace because you know

07:06.384 --> 07:09.845
lt's okay to be afraid

07:11.181 --> 07:15.059
Like a cIoud
I am soft

07:15.143 --> 07:18.771
Like bamboo
I bend in the wind

07:18.855 --> 07:23.359
Creeping sIow
l'm at peace because l know

07:23.693 --> 07:27.530
lt's okay to be afraid

07:28.990 --> 07:31.659
-One aIone is not enough
-One aIone is not enough

07:31.743 --> 07:36.288
-You need both together
-You need both together

07:36.373 --> 07:42.586
Winter, summer
Moon and sun

07:42.671 --> 07:45.047
Lesson number one

07:46.633 --> 07:48.759
-Like a cIoud
-Like a rock

07:48.844 --> 07:50.469
-I am soft
-I must be hard

07:50.554 --> 07:52.138
-Like bamboo
-Like an oak

07:52.222 --> 07:53.973
-I bend in the wind
-I must stand firm

07:54.057 --> 07:55.307
You can fly

07:55.392 --> 07:58.644
-l'm at peace because l know
-Cut quick Iike my bIade

07:58.728 --> 08:00.563
-Think fast
-lt's okay to be afraid

08:00.647 --> 08:02.648
Unafraid

08:02.732 --> 08:05.568
-You have begun
-Lesson number one

08:05.652 --> 08:07.862
Lesson number one
Lesson number one

08:07.946 --> 08:11.073
Lesson number one

08:15.078 --> 08:16.328
It's General Shang.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.664
-General Shang.
-It's Shang.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.584
Look, it's General Shang.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.547
Hello, little warriors.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.593
-The new uniform suits you, General.
-The uniform. Yes.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.017
-Now I just have to live up to it.
-Of course you will.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.478
-You're very brave.
-Right. Brave.

08:41.563 --> 08:46.650
Yes, well, Mulan,
I haven't known you for very long,

08:46.735 --> 08:49.528
but I feel that doesn't matter so much
when a man is in. . .

08:52.115 --> 08:53.616
When a man is in. . .

08:56.703 --> 08:58.746
Is there someplace private we can talk?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.581
We can go to my house.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.794
Okay, everybody,
time to be like the river and flow home.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.546
-Okay.
-Oh, no.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.797
Bye, Shang.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.091
-Bye, Shang. Bye, Mulan.
-See you.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.013
Could you take care of this for me?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.686
You know,
you're never gonna get that back.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.579
She said yes.

09:42.249 --> 09:47.962
When one's heart is overfilled with joy,
some may spill from the eyes.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.130
You can say that again.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.174
I win the pot.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.929
Actually, you bet
he would propose before sundown.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.099
I bet he would propose before noon.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.768
But, you don't gamble.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.688
Betting against my mother
is not a gamble.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.189
It's an investment.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.320
What a happy, happy day.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.656
My little baby's getting married.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.617
-Mushu, someone will hear you.
-I can't help it.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.786
You know dragons are very emotional.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.915
It seems like just last month
you and I were saving China.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.751
-It was last month.
-How time flies.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.296
You know, baby,
this must be a magical moment for you.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.256
It's not every day I get engaged.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.300
No, I meant telling me you're engaged.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.178
After all, I'm the guy that gave you
and Pretty Boy the hookup.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.723
Am I a guardian or am I a guardian?

10:42.350 --> 10:44.435
You're more than that, Mushu.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.603
You're my most trusted friend.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.564
That did it.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.941
Are you crying again?

10:51.026 --> 10:53.193
No, I just got some exfoliating cream
in my eye.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.279
Of course I'm crying, girl.
What you think?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.198
Oh, Mulan. I'm just so happy for me.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.742
You?

11:00.744 --> 11:03.746
This wedding business
is a big status boost for me.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.622
When those ancestors
look up the career ladder,

11:05.707 --> 11:08.000
all they gonna see is my behind.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.378
So glad my getting married
is helping you out, Mushu.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.297
All right, I get you, Miss Missy.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.923
But, you know,
I'm thinking about you too.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.967
In fact, I'm gonna plan your wedding.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.762
First, I gotta work me up a theme.
You know, theme is everything.

11:19.846 --> 11:23.140
How about Rainbow of Memories?

11:23.808 --> 11:25.184
No, that's too junior prom.

11:25.268 --> 11:28.062
I've got it. The theme is Think Pink.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.689
You know, pink is the new red, girl.
It's simple, it says it.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.025
Now, watch my smoke.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.610
Cri-Kee, to the fabric store.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.988
Mulan?

11:38.073 --> 11:41.700
Seems your grandma invited someone
to help us celebrate the engagement.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.827
Really? Who?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.788
China.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.291
Congratulations!

11:51.127 --> 11:52.961
Isn't it wonderful?

11:53.046 --> 11:55.214
Sorry, it's sort of slapdash.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.965
It took us by surprise, you know?

11:58.259 --> 12:00.761
Make way for the happy couple.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.058
Now, this is a battlefield.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.893
What's our strategy, General?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.479
Divide and conquer.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.526
All right, all right, all right, dead people,
we've got work to do,

12:15.610 --> 12:17.569
so let's move with purpose.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.364
I've got an important announcement
to make.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.743
Hold on to your ectoplasm, now.
Mulan's getting married.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.835
All right, all right, all right,
simmer down. I know just how you feel.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.462
But time is wasting, people,
so let's move, move, move.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.423
The theme is pink.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.633
I wanna see pink flowers,
pink ribbons, pink bows.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.969
I'm not talking about salmon.
Don't show me no blush.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.847
I mean, pink
as a freshly slapped newborn's behind.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.724
-How about a pink slip?
-Excuse me?

12:47.809 --> 12:50.394
Don't nobody wanna see your drawers.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.771
Actually, she meant this.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.608
Hey, this looks like a for-real pink slip.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.570
You know, like a "you're fired" pink slip.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.655
-It is.
-Say what?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.366
The pink slip is for you.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.453
It is written, once a woman marries,

13:07.537 --> 13:11.373
her husband's ancestors
take over the duty of guardianship.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.919
Oh, no, your scroll must have a typo.
That can't be.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.965
-But it is. You're out of a job.
-Out of a pedestal.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.176
And out of our hair, fool.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.096
Oh, no, no, no. I ain't going out like this.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.141
It took me 500 years
to get this pedestal back,

13:29.225 --> 13:30.976
and I ain't about to give it up.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.979
Hear me, you lazy lounge lizard.

13:34.063 --> 13:38.025
The moment Fa Mulan is married,
you've got your old job back.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.402
Remember gong duty?

13:40.945 --> 13:43.489
Perhaps this will ring a bell.

13:51.664 --> 13:59.588
Mushu's on his way out

13:59.672 --> 14:02.674
Mushu's on his way out
Mushu's on his way out

14:02.759 --> 14:04.676
What am I gonna do?

14:05.762 --> 14:07.846
Mushu's on his way out

14:17.357 --> 14:20.817
-So tell me, will it be a big wedding?
-Absolutely.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.778
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.114
-Children?
-As many as possible.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.116
Maybe one or two.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.410
-We'll think about it.
-Right away.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.412
-Blue. Mild.
-Pink. Spicy.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.872
-Yes.
-No.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.791
Oh, dear. Did you hear that?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.794
Not exactly a harmonious couple,
are they?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.170
What should we do?

14:40.255 --> 14:43.298
Perhaps we should give our gift
to the children now.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.973
General Shang, Fa Mulan.
Orders from His Majesty the Emperor.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.683
-Is there trouble?
-Yes, sir.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.726
Report to the Imperial Palace.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.479
We'll leave at once.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.608
This must be pretty important
for the Emperor to want both of us.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.819
He knows a winning team
when he sees one.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.113
Since when are they the winning team?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.991
The ink ain't even dry on my pink slip
and I'm being replaced.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.371
Yeah, I know, you're right.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.582
How could I have been so selfish?

15:16.666 --> 15:19.001
Look at them.
Those two clearly got it going on.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.502
Cri-Kee, I've made a decision.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.838
I gotta kiss my pedestal goodbye,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.132
because my girl's happiness
comes first.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.138
Ba-ba. Ma-ma.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.849
We were just admiring the Mudan tree.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.559
It's so lovely this year.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.604
The blossoms reach
for the sunlight above,

15:38.688 --> 15:43.442
yet unseen,
the roots reach for the rainwater below.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.403
Sun and rain, so different.

15:46.487 --> 15:52.451
Yet only by working together
do they create harmony and life.

15:52.535 --> 15:56.121
I know, Ba-ba.
The lesson of yin and yang.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.833
And to help you remember that lesson. . .

15:59.917 --> 16:02.419
Father, Mother. Your necklaces.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.173
Not ours.
Our great-great-grandparents.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.675
And now, yours.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.553
Thank you, sir.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.764
They're so beautiful.

16:14.057 --> 16:18.268
But you'll be surprised
how heavily they can weigh.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.688
To share the burden,
you must work together.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.483
Like the sun and rain.

16:25.902 --> 16:26.985
Wait a minute.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.529
Old man Fa Zhou got a point now.

16:29.614 --> 16:33.325
Mulan and Shang
are as different as sun and rain.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.619
And when the infatuation wears off,

16:35.703 --> 16:37.996
their tree of life's
gonna wind up with root rot.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.376
Yeah, sure she seems happy.
That's the real tragedy here.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.961
The girl don't even realize
how miserable she is.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.215
That's why I gotta nip this thing
in the bud.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.052
This is not about my pedestal.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.430
This is about Mulan
making the biggest mistake of my. . .

16:56.307 --> 16:58.100
I mean, her life.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.728
Man, how could I have been so selfish?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.939
Mulan's a girl worth fighting for.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.651
And after all, I am the girl's guardian.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.445
Cri-Kee, I'm gonna break them up.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.617
So I guess that means you're on board.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.500
Mulan, could you smooth out
the ride a little bit?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.335
I'm getting horsesick.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.921
Mushu. What are you doing here?

17:28.005 --> 17:30.215
Hey, whither thou go, I goest, girl.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.135
Remember, teamwork isn't about ego,
it's about we go.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.096
Cri-Kee. What are you doing here?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.642
Protect Mulan from me?
I'm her guardian.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.936
Yeah, yeah, her lucky cricket.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.896
You're lucky
I don't break out the bug spray.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.242
As we stand here,

17:57.326 --> 18:00.454
Mongol forces
are moving closer to our border.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.373
The threat of attack
is growing every day.

18:03.458 --> 18:07.252
As it is,
our army is hopelessly outnumbered.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.336
Your Majesty,

18:08.421 --> 18:10.797
let me lead my forces
in a preemptive strike.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.550
Each of my warriors
will fight like 1 0 Mongols.

18:13.634 --> 18:14.760
No, General.

18:14.844 --> 18:18.680
I plan to defeat this enemy
without the use of force.

18:19.015 --> 18:24.936
Instead, we will forge a union so strong,
the Mongol hordes won't dare attack.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.648
An alliance
with the kingdom of Qui Gong.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.486
We will become united
through marriage.

18:32.695 --> 18:36.114
You will escort three princesses
to Qui Gong.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.117
There, they will marry
Lord Chin's sons. . .

18:39.202 --> 18:41.745
-What?
-And seal this critical alliance.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.163
Yes, Your Majesty.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.082
My advisors tell me the charts are clear.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.377
If this wedding does not take place
in three days,

18:49.462 --> 18:52.255
the alliance will crumble
and the Mongols will destroy us.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.259
Mark my words, General, three days.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.928
Not a moment more, Your Majesty.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.766
I know that face, Fa Mulan.
What troubles you?

19:02.850 --> 19:05.477
Your Majesty, an arranged marriage?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.148
Rest assured, child,

19:10.233 --> 19:14.069
my daughters know
exactly what they are doing.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.487
Your daughters?

19:15.571 --> 19:18.990
They consider it an honor
to marry in the cause of peace.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.202
Your Majesty, I. . .

19:22.286 --> 19:24.746
Apology accepted.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.666
General, how many troops
do you estimate you will need

19:27.750 --> 19:29.251
to accomplish this mission?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.461
-Three.
-Three companies?

19:31.546 --> 19:34.548
-Three men.
-You surprise me, General.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.049
These are my children.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.052
This mission does not call for force,
but finesse.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.304
We must become one
with the countryside.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.598
As Emperor, I trust you.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.850
As a father,

19:44.934 --> 19:49.062
I implore you
to choose your three soldiers wisely.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.481
I know just the men. Fearless.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.567
-Loyal.
-And disciplined.

19:53.651 --> 19:57.028
China's most honorable
and noble soldiers.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.531
And stay out!

20:01.576 --> 20:04.160
I've found wives for hundreds of men.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.705
But the Golden Dragon of Unity himself

20:06.789 --> 20:09.541
couldn't make love matches
for you three.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.420
Come back when you get personalities.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.132
Well, that's a fine way
to treat China's greatest. . .

20:18.634 --> 20:20.135
Heroes.

20:20.595 --> 20:21.636
What's her problem?

20:21.721 --> 20:25.432
All I asked for was a girl
who would worship the dirt I walk on.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.184
I simply asked for someone
who would cook for me

20:28.269 --> 20:29.895
morning, noon and night.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.314
And I just wanted a girl
who likes to laugh.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.608
And thinks I'm a god.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.943
Perhaps we weren't specific enough.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.446
Forget that dragon lady.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.908
The only ones
who can find girls worthy of us is us.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.034
Yeah.

20:44.118 --> 20:48.496
Well, l don't need her
To be all smug and snooty

20:48.748 --> 20:52.417
l got a plaque right here
That says l kicked Hun booty

20:53.502 --> 20:55.921
We have everything
We dreamed we'd find

20:56.005 --> 20:57.923
When we came back from war

20:58.007 --> 20:59.758
Yeah, everything but

21:01.928 --> 21:04.846
A girl worth fighting for

21:05.014 --> 21:06.389
Hey, suck in your gut.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.642
There's a girl worth fighting for

21:08.726 --> 21:11.394
And I think she wants us to come over.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.606
My girl will laugh at all my jokes

21:14.690 --> 21:16.274
But tell it to me straight

21:16.359 --> 21:18.735
She'II rub my head when I get sick

21:18.819 --> 21:21.529
And let me pick off of her plate

21:21.822 --> 21:26.159
lf Ling can find a girl
Who likes his chopstick nose trick

21:26.243 --> 21:29.120
Oh, he reaIIy better just propose quick

21:31.165 --> 21:35.502
Well, l have to say
Based on today l'm cranky

21:35.586 --> 21:37.754
l'll just spend my life with you two

21:37.838 --> 21:40.340
Pass the hanky

21:40.424 --> 21:42.634
And there's no one there
To steal my chair

21:42.718 --> 21:45.303
And twirI around the fIoor

21:45.388 --> 21:49.140
Wish that I had
A girl worth fighting for

21:49.892 --> 21:52.435
I wouId be true
To a girl worth fighting

21:52.520 --> 21:54.604
I'd make fondue
For a girl worth fighting

21:54.689 --> 21:57.315
l'd even kiss you
For a girl worth fighting

21:59.402 --> 22:01.319
For

22:01.737 --> 22:04.280
Mulan. General Shang.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.201
If you three aren't too busy
disturbing the peace,

22:08.285 --> 22:10.453
I need you to join Mulan and me
on a mission.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.622
-To save China?
-Naturally.

22:12.707 --> 22:17.794
I'll be leaving behind
a few broken hearts, but count me in.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.047
-Sign me up.
-When do we start, General?

22:21.132 --> 22:22.424
Tonight.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.708
We're about to depart,
Your Highnesses.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.878
You have my word
we will arrive swiftly and safely.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.172
My sisters and I thank you,
General Shang.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.926
Permit me to introduce Fa Mulan.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.720
It is a privilege
to meet the hero of China.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.056
I leave you in her capable hands.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.265
Stand ready.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.977
-You might need these. It's a little chilly.
-Thank you, Fa Mulan.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.562
You're welcome, Your Highness.

23:59.647 --> 24:03.691
-So, you're getting married?
-Oh, yes.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.278
-To princes in Qui Gong.
-That's right.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.656
Well, they must be handsome.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.075
We don't know. We've never met them.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.535
Really?

24:13.619 --> 24:17.080
So you have no idea
what they're like at all.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.873
It's all right, Fa Mulan.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.334
It's our honor to serve the Emperor.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.836
And the Middle Kingdom.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.046
The whole thing is so exciting.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.298
We're very happy, really.

24:28.050 --> 24:31.261
Well, I'm glad to hear that. I'm not sure
I could go through with some. . .

24:31.345 --> 24:33.221
Mulan, prepare to move out.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.682
Time to get going.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.563
Move out.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.494
If we get to the Honshu pass
by midday tomorrow. . .

24:56.579 --> 24:58.955
We'll have just enough time
to make it to Qui Gong.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.416
Yeah, just enough time to stop Mulan

25:01.500 --> 25:03.001
from making the biggest mistake
of my. . .

25:03.085 --> 25:05.420
I mean, her life.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.366
What's the face?

25:35.451 --> 25:37.327
-What face?
-That face.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.371
There's no face.
This is my face, that's all.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.291
You know I know you
better than that, Mulan.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.709
What's wrong?

25:45.294 --> 25:48.755
-I realize our duty is to the mission. . .
-But. . .

25:48.839 --> 25:52.217
But I have another duty. To my heart.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.428
Mulan, your only duty is to the Emperor.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.931
But, Shang, an arranged marriage?

25:58.015 --> 26:01.351
I know, but not everyone
can be as lucky as we are.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.978
In an ideal world,
everyone would marry for love.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.314
But the world isn't perfect.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.442
I'm just glad my world is.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.491
"My world." Talk about selfish.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.369
You know, you don't hear me bragging
about how it's my world,

26:19.453 --> 26:20.912
even though it pretty much is.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.038
I'm telling you, Cri-Kee,

26:22.122 --> 26:25.166
the sooner I bust them apart,
the better things will be for Mulan.

26:26.043 --> 26:30.546
And so I said,
you just broke my best set of China.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.549
China. Get it?

26:33.634 --> 26:36.469
Did you see the way she looked at me?

26:36.553 --> 26:37.887
You mean with disgust?

26:39.306 --> 26:40.640
No.

26:40.724 --> 26:45.353
Our eyes met
and we shared a cosmic moment.

26:46.188 --> 26:49.190
Just like when I look
at potted pig's knuckles.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.151
It's love, I tell you.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.945
Love.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.697
Love, shmove.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.116
It doesn't matter, we're on a mission.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.660
No fraternizing with the princesses.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.830
Engaged-to-be-married princesses.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.665
Oh, yeah.

27:15.801 --> 27:19.178
China is so big. Isn't it beautiful, Mei?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.055
Mei?

27:21.932 --> 27:24.350
Yes, beautiful.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.145
Did you see the way he looked at me?

27:27.229 --> 27:29.063
Who, the gorilla with the bad eye?

27:29.148 --> 27:33.234
Gorilla?
He's more like a big cuddly panda bear.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.904
-But you didn't even talk to him.
-A true romantic can tell.

27:37.364 --> 27:40.992
He may be coarse on the outside,
but on the inside. . .

27:41.076 --> 27:43.828
-He's gross?
-I mean, under that.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.538
He smells?

27:45.873 --> 27:48.041
I can see past my nose.

27:48.125 --> 27:54.422
Deep down, deep, deep down,
way down, there's something.

27:54.715 --> 27:57.633
Ting Ting, I think she's in love.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.761
Oh, no. There will be none of that.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.847
Remember, Mei,
you are to be married in three days.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.432
You gave your solemn oath.

28:06.602 --> 28:07.935
You're right.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.445
We're stopping to water the horses,
Your Highnesses.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.155
Maybe you'd like to stretch your legs?

28:19.239 --> 28:21.824
Are the guard fellows out there?

28:22.117 --> 28:24.369
Yes. You're perfectly safe.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.996
I think a leg stretch would be very nice.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.635
Thank you for helping me
with my slipper.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.054
May I know your name?

28:43.722 --> 28:47.058
Now. Dow. Cow. Bao?

28:47.142 --> 28:48.726
No, you must eat.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.938
It must be exhausting
guarding us day and night.

28:52.022 --> 28:56.275
Oh, no.
Well, yes, but I'm strong, and marching.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.488
Yes, I suppose all that training
does make it second nature.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.243
But I think, you, a princess, with royal. . .

29:05.327 --> 29:06.911
I could never. . .

29:06.995 --> 29:08.955
But it is our duty, and our honor.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.165
Although it can be a burden.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.918
I've said too much.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.379
You are very easy to talk to, Yao.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.382
Permit me to echo your praise,
Your Highness.

29:19.466 --> 29:23.928
I find your presence engaging
and your conversation sparkling.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.430
Thank you.

29:42.072 --> 29:45.741
Well, hello there. I am Ling.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.578
I am Princess Ting Ting.

29:48.662 --> 29:52.415
Well, if you ever need me,
just give me a ting-a-ling.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.960
Come on, Your Highness.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.463
You don't wanna let your guard down.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.798
Get it? Guard? Down?

30:00.883 --> 30:02.216
Thank you.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.012
You know,
I've got some blue blood myself.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.055
Many have called me a royal pain.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.016
Thank you.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.310
You've been a great crowd.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.357
Ting Ting, look, isn't this fruit lovely?

30:18.442 --> 30:21.777
Chien-Po got it for me. He's so sweet.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.155
Just get your pomegranates
in the carriage.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.461
Fa Mulan?

30:38.545 --> 30:41.255
Your Highness. Is anything wrong?

30:41.340 --> 30:44.133
No, no, not at all.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.552
Are you sure?

30:48.180 --> 30:51.098
I just wanted to compliment you.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.435
You were so brave
to take your father's place in the army.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.188
Well, thank you.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.524
Your duty was to stay home,

30:59.608 --> 31:02.693
but your heart told you
to break the rules.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.446
How did you decide
between duty and heart?

31:08.325 --> 31:10.743
Well, it wasn't easy.

31:10.827 --> 31:15.164
But, by following my feelings,
I wound up doing the right thing.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.626
I guess I learned
that my duty is to my heart.

31:19.336 --> 31:22.630
"My duty is to my heart."

31:22.839 --> 31:26.801
Yes, that makes sense.
That's marvelous.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.303
Thank you, Fa Mulan. Thank you.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.848
You're welcome, I guess.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.142
Let's get back on the road.

31:37.938 --> 31:41.357
That's my cue
to put Operation Shang into action.

31:41.441 --> 31:46.320
Pretty Boy's gonna look so bad,
it will send Mulan running for the hills.

31:48.073 --> 31:51.200
This is gonna be delicious.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.625
Watch this.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.878
Hey. What?

32:07.593 --> 32:08.884
Hey.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.803
Good catch, Shang.

32:35.329 --> 32:36.746
Shang?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.103
Hey.

33:02.564 --> 33:03.773
Tasty.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.993
I try and I try.

33:16.078 --> 33:19.163
I put my heart and soul
into busting them up.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.123
And what do I have to show for it?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.503
A cricket laughs in my face.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.090
I just can't do it anymore.

33:30.217 --> 33:35.137
Great ancestors,
I throw myself at your mercy.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.765
My pedestal is all but a distant memory.

33:38.392 --> 33:40.351
Great Spirits, take me now.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.530
Hold on, ladies.

33:52.614 --> 33:55.616
Help! We'll save you.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.702
Look out, a cliff!

33:57.786 --> 33:58.994
They're headed for the cliff.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.621
Come on.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.127
-Time to go, ladies.
-Ting Ting, over here.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.962
Go.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.714
-You're next.
-No, no, no.

34:09.798 --> 34:11.257
-Alley-oop.
-Take my arm.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.343
-Ling.
-Ting Ting's stuck.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.638
Mulan, the rope.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.522
Hang on.

34:41.830 --> 34:45.750
-Is everyone all right?
-Mei, I'll save you.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.960
I saved the food.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.171
And I saved you.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.506
Mulan.

34:55.135 --> 34:58.012
-What happened?
-I don't know, I wasn't near the carriage.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.389
Yao, Ling. Save the supplies.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.893
Keep paddling.
Look how great you're doing.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.687
-Who's the big boy?
-Thank you.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.608
My fault?

35:12.235 --> 35:13.652
This wasn't my plan.

35:13.737 --> 35:18.365
Wagon's busted, cold and miserable,
everything's ruined.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.284
Or maybe not.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.329
Old Shang's steaming
like a fresh pork bun.

35:24.706 --> 35:27.958
I bet he and Mulan
are two nasty words away

35:28.043 --> 35:30.085
from an all-out feud.

35:30.170 --> 35:34.131
Oh, Cri-Kee,
things are brightening up after all.

35:48.688 --> 35:52.399
-I've seen happier princesses.
-That's the least of our problems.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.237
There's a mountain pass
between here and Qui Gong.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.949
It takes us through bandit country,
but it's the only way.

36:00.033 --> 36:02.576
Why not just follow the river?

36:02.661 --> 36:06.455
-Because the river is not on the map.
-It's bound to go past a town.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.666
And where there's a town,
there's a road.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.376
There's no town on the map.

36:10.460 --> 36:14.296
Well, then maybe we should
just forget the map and wing it.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.966
We can't "wing it." We need a new plan.

36:17.050 --> 36:19.510
We have three days.
What if we get lost?

36:19.594 --> 36:22.179
Then we pull over and ask directions.

36:22.264 --> 36:25.933
We don't need to pull over
and ask directions. We have a map.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.102
What is it with men
and asking directions?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.062
What is it with women and maps?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.856
You're saying women can't read maps?

36:31.940 --> 36:33.899
I'm saying that
women will ask directions,

36:33.984 --> 36:35.276
but they won't follow directions.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.027
Men follow directions,
so they don't need. . .

36:37.112 --> 36:38.904
General, I. . .

36:40.740 --> 36:42.783
Am I interrupting?

36:43.243 --> 36:45.744
-What is it, Yao?
-Scout report.

36:45.829 --> 36:48.873
I've found a village
and a path to it through the forest.

36:48.957 --> 36:51.083
A forest path?

36:51.167 --> 36:53.377
Great. Show us.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.297
See?
If it were a snake, it would have bit you.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.133
There's bound to be a road down there
that will lead us to Qui Gong.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.635
-Good work, Yao.
-Thank you, sir.

37:08.602 --> 37:10.311
Shang, I'm sorry.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.354
You're in charge of the mission.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.189
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.525
A good leader is open to new ideas.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.902
Forgive me?

37:17.986 --> 37:19.653
There's nothing to forgive.

37:29.831 --> 37:33.042
I'd better go.
I've got the first watch, General.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.376
But. . .

37:38.590 --> 37:40.382
Are you bugging? Look at her go.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.967
She can't wait to get away from him.

37:43.720 --> 37:47.097
That's no smile, that's a mask of pain.

37:48.683 --> 37:53.395
Yeah, well, that was just phase one
of my new 1 8-phase master plan.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.607
Now, just watch phase two
when I get up close

37:57.400 --> 37:59.568
and personal.

38:14.709 --> 38:18.462
Excuse me, Your Highness,
I found your fan.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.256
It just needed a little drying out.

38:22.092 --> 38:23.634
Thank you, Ling.

38:23.718 --> 38:28.138
Normally,
I would say I'm your biggest fan,

38:28.223 --> 38:31.725
but, I'll just go away now.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.268
Again.

38:34.729 --> 38:35.896
Sorry.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.524
I'll replace that.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.404
Of course she doesn't like you.
You're just such a ding-a-ling.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.074
He likes you.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.076
It would seem so.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.412
And you like him.

38:51.746 --> 38:56.583
Well,
I appreciate that he's a good soldier.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.878
How can you do that?

38:59.963 --> 39:01.922
How can you look right at someone,

39:02.007 --> 39:04.925
realize you share a special connection,
and then just. . .

39:05.010 --> 39:07.678
I know where my duty lies, Mei.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.263
Do you?

39:26.656 --> 39:31.035
"And so, my dear father,
I cannot complete this mission.

39:31.119 --> 39:35.914
"I have come to realize
that my duty is to my heart."

39:36.291 --> 39:38.125
What are you doing?

39:40.128 --> 39:43.630
-She's running away.
-Mei, what are you thinking?

39:44.257 --> 39:45.966
I can't complete this mission.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.551
I know that now.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.179
Why, because
Yao has given you his heart?

39:50.263 --> 39:52.723
No, it's not about his heart.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.725
It's about mine.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.935
Mei, we've discussed this.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.814
A princess must make every sacrifice
for her country.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.858
It's our duty.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.863
The life of a princess

40:09.282 --> 40:12.493
From her birth is weII-defined

40:13.828 --> 40:17.331
She must humbIy serve her country

40:18.249 --> 40:21.752
Play the part she's been assigned

40:22.629 --> 40:26.840
She guards the hopes of her peopIe

40:27.175 --> 40:31.220
Weak and mighty, rich and poor

40:32.180 --> 40:34.264
Who couId ever ask for more?

40:34.349 --> 40:38.769
Who couId ever ask for

40:38.853 --> 40:40.771
More?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.192
l wanna be like other girls

40:45.276 --> 40:48.153
CIimb up a tree Iike other girIs can

40:48.238 --> 40:55.077
Just to be free like other girls get to be

40:55.870 --> 40:57.412
Mei. Su.

40:57.497 --> 40:58.956
To sIouch when I sit

40:59.040 --> 41:00.249
To eat a whoIe cake

41:00.333 --> 41:01.792
Feel the sun on my feet

41:01.876 --> 41:03.335
-Get dirty
-Act silly

41:03.419 --> 41:05.629
Be anything l want to be

41:05.713 --> 41:08.507
-Dance around
-ln my underwear

41:09.175 --> 41:10.592
To run really fast

41:10.677 --> 41:12.052
To get rid of this fan

41:12.137 --> 41:14.138
-To eat a whoIe cake
-Get crazy

41:14.222 --> 41:15.639
-With frosting
-No escorts

41:15.723 --> 41:17.015
-No manners
-No nursemaids

41:17.100 --> 41:19.852
No worries, no hands folded perfect

41:19.936 --> 41:22.104
Like holding a lily

41:22.188 --> 41:24.356
No pinchy shoes?

41:26.067 --> 41:28.819
l wanna be like other girls

41:28.903 --> 41:31.905
Scrape up my knee Iike other girIs can

41:31.990 --> 41:37.035
Just to be free
Like other girls

41:37.120 --> 41:40.581
Get to be

41:41.374 --> 41:42.791
To speak for myself

41:42.876 --> 41:44.042
To sing way off key

41:44.127 --> 41:45.502
Marry someone l've met

41:45.587 --> 41:47.087
Who Ioves me for me

41:47.172 --> 41:49.882
No escorts, no manners
No nursemaids, no worries

41:49.966 --> 41:51.967
No hands folded perfect

41:52.051 --> 41:54.219
Like holding a lily

41:54.304 --> 41:58.182
No pinchy shoes

41:58.266 --> 42:00.934
l wanna be like other girls

42:01.102 --> 42:03.979
CIimb up a tree Iike other girIs can

42:04.063 --> 42:10.485
Just to be free like other girls

42:10.612 --> 42:16.950
Get to be

42:29.714 --> 42:32.090
She defied you.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.551
She insulted you.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.221
-Man, she laughed at your map.
-My map.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.389
And if she's laughing to your face,

42:39.474 --> 42:42.768
imagine what she's saying
behind your back.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.645
Back.

42:45.188 --> 42:46.438
She's a loose cannon.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.815
-She's out of control.
-She's out of control.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.984
I mean, who's in charge here? You?

42:51.069 --> 42:54.238
-I'm in charge, I'm in charge.
-Or Mulan? Mulan.

42:54.530 --> 42:56.573
-Mulan.
-Mulan.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.242
Mulan !

43:05.208 --> 43:07.376
General Shang? That's not it.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.835
General Shang?

43:08.920 --> 43:10.671
Hello, it's me, Mulan.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.339
General Shang.

43:13.508 --> 43:16.260
Shang, Shang, Shang.

43:16.344 --> 43:17.386
I got it.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.266
General Shang?

43:22.350 --> 43:25.686
General Hardhead,
that's what they should call him.

43:25.812 --> 43:29.523
-Everything's got to have a strategy.
-Mulan?

43:29.607 --> 43:32.442
The man won't brush his teeth
without a backup plan.

43:32.527 --> 43:34.653
-What?
-I blame myself.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.613
I fell for those broad shoulders.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.408
I didn't realize there wasn't much
sitting on top of them.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.079
Except for that garlic breath.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.999
That boy can peel paint.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.045
That's enough. Where is she?

43:55.425 --> 43:57.050
I am good.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.469
-Mulan.
-Why, hello, general.

43:59.554 --> 44:01.096
Out on night maneuvers?

44:01.180 --> 44:03.390
General Hardhead? Brushing my teeth?

44:04.434 --> 44:08.687
-Is something wrong?
-I heard you, Mulan. Every word.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.356
Every word of what?

44:11.441 --> 44:14.359
Don't play coy.
I saw you outside my tent.

44:14.444 --> 44:16.903
What? I haven't left my post.

44:16.988 --> 44:20.324
And I suppose you weren't gossiping
about me with the princesses?

44:20.408 --> 44:23.160
Shang, did that dip in the river
get you waterlogged?

44:23.244 --> 44:26.246
And why are you talking
with your hand over your mouth?

44:26.331 --> 44:29.124
I wouldn't want to peel your paint.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.211
Changing of the guard.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.672
And next time, don't leave your post.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.091
What's with him?

44:40.595 --> 44:42.179
What's with her?

44:42.263 --> 44:44.056
Who am I talking to?

44:45.350 --> 44:47.601
How could he not believe me?

44:48.436 --> 44:50.020
I don't know, girlfriend.

44:50.104 --> 44:55.359
But I do know this. Without trust,
there can be no relationship.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.694
And that man don't trust you.

44:57.779 --> 44:59.488
Maybe he was just confused.

44:59.572 --> 45:02.115
Please. First, you fussed
about the arranged marriage.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.825
Then you fought
about which way to Qui Gong.

45:03.910 --> 45:06.661
Now, y'all feuding over nothing.
It seems pretty clear to me.

45:06.746 --> 45:07.954
You're right.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.875
-Mushu, I don't know what to do.
-I do. It's simple.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.795
Drop that boy like a hot pot sticker.
Kick him to the curb.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.047
Burn his letters
and dance around the fire yelling,

45:17.131 --> 45:19.674
"Happy days are here again."

45:19.759 --> 45:20.926
You know, you have a point.

45:21.010 --> 45:24.221
If this is the real Li Shang,
I don't like what I'm seeing.

45:31.187 --> 45:32.687
I hope the tea is still warm.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.574
-After you.
-No, after you.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.535
-No, after you.
-After you.

45:46.619 --> 45:48.412
I said, after you.

45:57.296 --> 45:58.422
You, I'm gonna. . .

45:58.506 --> 45:59.840
Yao.

46:00.508 --> 46:02.634
Is everything all right?

46:03.094 --> 46:04.177
No.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.221
I mean, yes.

46:06.305 --> 46:10.142
You see, Chien-Po here
has always had a dream.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.018
-A dream?
-A dream?

46:12.103 --> 46:14.521
-A dream.
-But I don't. . .

46:16.023 --> 46:17.399
That dream.

46:17.483 --> 46:21.445
A dream of seeing a small village
in the middle of nowhere

46:21.529 --> 46:23.196
by the moonlight.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.614
How can we help?

46:24.699 --> 46:29.536
Well, if Your Highnesses would consent
to come with us to the village,

46:29.620 --> 46:34.291
we could still guard you,
and Chien-Po could have his dream.

46:34.375 --> 46:37.752
My one chance to be like other guys.

46:37.837 --> 46:39.171
-Can we? Can we?
-Can we, please?

46:39.255 --> 46:41.590
-Please, come on.
-Ting Ting, please.

46:41.674 --> 46:42.841
Sounds like fun.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.384
Hurray! Hurray!

46:45.928 --> 46:47.137
We're sorry.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.722
We're off.

46:49.724 --> 46:51.933
I never noticed we were so different.

46:52.393 --> 46:54.269
It's like I don't even know him.

46:54.562 --> 46:56.771
Well, what do you know about that?

46:56.856 --> 47:01.776
I mean, I know he's by the book,
but doesn't the man ever bend a rule?

47:01.861 --> 47:04.070
And speaking of bending rules. . .

47:04.155 --> 47:07.741
You know, relationships are easy
when everything runs nice and smooth.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.326
-But. . .
-Mulan.

47:09.410 --> 47:12.579
-Nice and smooth just ran out of camp.
-What?

47:12.663 --> 47:15.373
Did you know that almonds, rice and
milk are part of a complete breakfast?

47:15.458 --> 47:16.458
Mushu.

47:16.542 --> 47:19.085
I'm just trying to tell you
the princesses went AWOL, that's all.

47:19.170 --> 47:22.088
-Where are the guards?
-Showing them the way.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.673
They're together?

47:24.217 --> 47:26.718
-"Together" together?
-Don't you understand Chinese?

47:30.765 --> 47:32.682
Hey, what about old Shang-hai?

47:32.767 --> 47:35.185
I think I better handle this one
on my own.

47:35.269 --> 47:37.729
Shang's on a short fuse as it is.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.065
Just make sure nothing wakes him up.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.361
You can count on me.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.838
Where are the guards?

48:04.215 --> 48:05.632
The princesses.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.643
"My duty is to my heart"?

48:21.065 --> 48:22.899
Mulan.

48:28.531 --> 48:29.739
Get your ticket, cricket.

48:29.824 --> 48:31.366
The show's about to begin.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.723
Look at all the food.

48:57.518 --> 48:59.936
We just got in some excellent ginger.

49:01.439 --> 49:02.564
Ginger.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.108
That goes very well with dumplings.

49:05.192 --> 49:06.943
Did you say dumplings?

49:08.571 --> 49:10.322
How about some fresh ginseng?

49:10.406 --> 49:13.199
That makes a wonderful
accompaniment to soy beans.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.161
One order of soy beans.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.294
-He's done.
-You're done.

49:24.837 --> 49:25.795
Oh, my.

49:25.880 --> 49:30.383
Who will be next to challenge
the undefeated Shi Rongkai?

49:33.304 --> 49:35.263
-Step aside.
-Yao.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.557
-Oh, no.
-You'll be killed, little man.

49:44.357 --> 49:46.399
So where does he go?

49:49.820 --> 49:52.030
Yao, you're my hero.

49:52.114 --> 49:54.991
Little, like a little gorilla.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.079
Pick a prize, any prize.

49:59.955 --> 50:02.290
Which one do you want, sir?

50:04.001 --> 50:05.377
Give me that one.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.387
Okay, okay.

50:15.471 --> 50:17.472
Okay, okay, how about this one?

50:17.556 --> 50:21.476
What does Attila say
when he walks through the door?

50:22.061 --> 50:24.688
Hun, I'm home.

50:30.945 --> 50:32.487
I give up.

50:32.571 --> 50:34.948
I guess I'm not as funny as I think.

50:47.378 --> 50:51.881
-What a cute laugh.
-Oh, no. I hate my laugh.

50:51.966 --> 50:53.883
What? It's adorable.

50:53.968 --> 50:56.886
I thought you didn't have
a sense of humor.

50:56.971 --> 50:58.596
No sense of humor?

51:22.913 --> 51:25.415
It's so beautiful.

51:25.499 --> 51:27.292
Yeah.

51:28.002 --> 51:30.295
It's the same moon
we see from the palace.

51:30.379 --> 51:34.841
No, this one is entirely different.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.718
You're right.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.845
I know I've never seen anything like it.

51:38.929 --> 51:40.221
Mulan.

51:40.306 --> 51:42.307
-I'm listening.
-We. . .

51:42.516 --> 51:44.768
-That is. . .
-All of us. . .

51:45.644 --> 51:49.063
-Oh, boy.
-Fa Mulan, it's love.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.065
Yao and myself, Chien-Po and Su. . .

51:51.150 --> 51:52.859
And myself and Lingy Bear.

51:52.943 --> 51:54.360
I mean, Ling.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.784
Group hug.

52:01.702 --> 52:04.037
I'm so happy for all of you.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.375
General Shang.

52:10.419 --> 52:12.796
-General Shang.
-Oh, boy.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.634
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

52:17.718 --> 52:19.886
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.889
I'm so sorry to break up your little party.

52:23.557 --> 52:25.225
This is gonna be good.

52:25.309 --> 52:27.352
Shang, before you jump to conclusions,

52:27.436 --> 52:28.937
let me explain the situation.

52:29.021 --> 52:30.897
Fine. Why don't we start with this?

52:31.398 --> 52:33.650
-That's mine.
-All yours?

52:33.734 --> 52:34.984
Or did you have help?

52:35.069 --> 52:38.363
"And so, my dear father,
I cannot complete this mission.

52:38.447 --> 52:41.741
"I have come to realize
that my duty is to my heart."

52:41.826 --> 52:44.828
-Now, who does that sound like?
-Mei never meant to send that letter.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.872
Your Highnesses, you swore a vow
to be married in Qui Gong.

52:47.957 --> 52:50.959
If your father saw you now
breaking that vow,

52:51.043 --> 52:52.252
what would he say?

52:54.255 --> 52:56.840
You three are to escort
Their Highnesses

52:56.924 --> 52:58.591
back to their tents immediately.

52:58.676 --> 53:01.177
You are to guard them.
You are not to enter their tents.

53:01.262 --> 53:02.762
You are not to speak to them.

53:02.847 --> 53:06.391
Not a word, ever. Am I understood?

53:06.475 --> 53:07.767
Yes, sir.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.784
Shang, the problem
isn't as bad as it seems.

53:24.869 --> 53:27.328
-The problem, Mulan, is you.
-What?

53:27.413 --> 53:29.914
You place your own feelings
above everything.

53:29.999 --> 53:33.167
Duty, obligation, tradition,
it all means nothing to you.

53:33.252 --> 53:35.044
It means everything to me.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.630
My heart tells me my duty,
and I follow it.

53:39.008 --> 53:40.884
You're a brilliant warrior, Shang.

53:42.845 --> 53:47.849
You're brave, you're loyal,
but you don't trust your heart.

53:49.184 --> 53:51.519
Sometimes I wonder
if you even have one.

53:52.938 --> 53:55.899
This assignment has made it clear.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.484
We are very different people.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.237
Maybe too different.

54:02.197 --> 54:03.364
Fine.

54:06.118 --> 54:07.827
We have a mission to complete.

54:10.873 --> 54:12.165
Fine.

54:38.192 --> 54:40.360
Isn't it a great day?

54:57.503 --> 55:00.088
I see Pretty Boy isn't talking to you.

55:00.172 --> 55:02.340
And you're not talking to Pretty Boy.

55:03.258 --> 55:05.134
Well, you know you can always
talk to me.

55:09.181 --> 55:12.100
Well, just wait till she realizes
what I've done for her.

55:12.184 --> 55:14.185
Will that frown turn upside down.

55:16.689 --> 55:18.272
Snapdragon?

55:18.357 --> 55:20.400
Just for that, I'm not talking to you.

55:24.405 --> 55:27.615
We're so sorry for what we've done,
Fa Mulan.

55:27.700 --> 55:30.326
You inspired us to follow our hearts.

55:30.411 --> 55:33.413
And we repay you
by ruining your relationship.

55:33.497 --> 55:37.250
No, you just opened my eyes
to how broken it was.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.210
I'm indebted to you, Mei.

55:51.765 --> 55:54.350
Keep a sharp eye.
This is bandit country.

56:00.733 --> 56:05.153
I sure wish we could talk
to the princesses, Yao.

56:05.237 --> 56:07.572
What? You know we can't.

56:10.409 --> 56:14.287
Yes, Ling, I also wish
we could talk to them.

56:14.371 --> 56:17.540
But as you know, orders is orders.

56:17.624 --> 56:24.005
Yes, but if I could talk to them,
do you know what I would say?

56:24.089 --> 56:28.593
No, Ling.
What would you say if only you could?

56:28.677 --> 56:32.722
I'd tell Ting Ting
that she's the prettiest, funniest,

56:32.806 --> 56:35.933
most extraordinary girl I've ever met.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.561
I would tell Princess Su

56:38.645 --> 56:44.108
that she is like fresh ginger
on the rice bowl of my life.

56:45.736 --> 56:51.574
And I would tell Mei
that she's one right babe.

57:05.339 --> 57:08.508
Mulan, what do you say
to a little pick-me-up?

57:09.009 --> 57:12.428
My father said
differences can make you stronger.

57:13.055 --> 57:16.182
He didn't realize
that Shang and I are just too different.

57:16.600 --> 57:19.894
Well, you know you always got me.

57:20.145 --> 57:22.522
The old team, right?

57:23.982 --> 57:26.484
You're always looking out
for me, Mushu.

57:27.027 --> 57:29.403
Well, just doing the best I can.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.782
Really, I just don't know what I'd do
without you.

57:33.325 --> 57:35.660
You're the best friend I've ever had.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.708
I can't stand it no more.

57:42.793 --> 57:46.420
The only thing wrong
with you and Shang is me.

57:46.505 --> 57:48.881
I'm the one that got between you.

57:48.966 --> 57:50.883
What are you talking about?

57:50.968 --> 57:53.344
It's not like you made the carriage
go into the river.

57:53.428 --> 57:54.846
Now, that was an accident.

57:54.930 --> 57:57.348
Following several attempts
at on purpose.

57:57.432 --> 58:01.060
And it wasn't you outside Shang's tent.

58:02.229 --> 58:03.354
You know how I gab.

58:03.438 --> 58:05.857
And you woke him up after I left?

58:05.941 --> 58:08.067
It wasn't easy neither.
That man can sleep.

58:08.152 --> 58:11.487
-Mushu, what did you do?
-Well, I was banging pots and pans.

58:11.572 --> 58:14.115
No. What did you do?

58:14.199 --> 58:16.951
You was getting married.
Everything was gonna change.

58:17.035 --> 58:19.745
I was gonna lose you. And my pedestal.

58:19.830 --> 58:22.999
You mean, you got between Shang
and me so you could keep your job?

58:23.083 --> 58:24.625
I'm sorry.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.420
What you did was unforgivable.

58:27.504 --> 58:30.506
But you and Shang are so different.

58:30.591 --> 58:34.343
Wait a second.
Not as different as I thought.

58:34.761 --> 58:38.598
All those problems, they weren't us.
They were you.

58:40.267 --> 58:42.476
I've got to talk to Shang,
tell him I love him.

58:43.395 --> 58:45.938
Mulan, I'll make it up to you. I promise.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.107
Forget it. You've helped enough.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.943
Shang. Shang.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.863
-It's an ambush.
-Bandits.

58:53.947 --> 58:55.781
Close ranks. Save the princesses.

58:57.743 --> 58:59.493
-Run, run.
-You two, get the gold.

58:59.578 --> 59:01.621
-Come on.
-You two, come with me.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.164
I got them.

59:03.248 --> 59:04.790
Shang, I've got your back.

59:08.670 --> 59:10.379
Take my hand.

59:13.926 --> 59:16.552
-Help!
-The princesses.

59:16.970 --> 59:20.640
-How dare you touch me?
-It won't budge.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.600
-Then take the whole package.
-No.

59:22.684 --> 59:24.393
Get your hands off her.

59:28.774 --> 59:30.983
Help!

59:31.068 --> 59:32.401
-No!
-Mei.

59:32.486 --> 59:34.237
Yao!

59:34.613 --> 59:36.364
Hold them off. Let's go.

59:40.327 --> 59:41.702
Help me.

59:43.372 --> 59:44.872
Run.

59:45.666 --> 59:47.041
-Mei.
-Yao.

59:51.004 --> 59:52.296
Come on.

1:00:06.895 --> 1:00:08.271
Let's get out of here.

1:00:16.363 --> 1:00:18.239
Shang, hang on.

1:00:18.323 --> 1:00:22.285
-It won't hold us both.
-It will. It will, Shang.

1:00:24.913 --> 1:00:26.080
Mulan.

1:00:27.582 --> 1:00:29.792
-I'm sorry.
-Please.

1:00:31.295 --> 1:00:32.837
Shang.

1:00:32.921 --> 1:00:34.672
Shang !

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:24.889
Shang.

1:01:47.162 --> 1:01:50.706
Fa Mulan, we're ready to go through
with the wedding.

1:01:50.791 --> 1:01:52.333
No.

1:01:52.417 --> 1:01:55.169
Your orders are to take care
of each other.

1:01:55.253 --> 1:01:56.921
But. . .

1:01:58.090 --> 1:02:01.133
Losing Shang will not be meaningless.

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:05.262
No matter what it takes,
I'm finishing this mission.

1:02:44.636 --> 1:02:46.011
Good horse.

1:02:49.182 --> 1:02:51.225
What do you mean, they are gone?

1:02:51.309 --> 1:02:53.060
There was an accident, Lord Chin.

1:02:53.145 --> 1:02:55.938
The royal carriage fell into the river
and was destroyed.

1:02:57.649 --> 1:03:00.693
A grave loss.

1:03:03.655 --> 1:03:07.241
But it does not alter my agreement
with the Emperor.

1:03:07.325 --> 1:03:09.368
And unless it is honored,

1:03:09.453 --> 1:03:13.539
I will sanction no alliance
with the Middle Kingdom.

1:03:13.623 --> 1:03:17.042
-A marriage was promised.
-And a marriage there will be.

1:03:19.713 --> 1:03:22.882
I would be honored
to wed a prince of Qui Gong.

1:03:22.966 --> 1:03:24.091
You?

1:03:24.176 --> 1:03:28.637
My Lord, Fa Mulan, the hero of China.

1:03:29.347 --> 1:03:35.269
A jewel in your crown far more dear
than three mere princesses.

1:03:39.441 --> 1:03:41.525
This is not what was agreed.

1:03:41.610 --> 1:03:47.239
However, the Golden Dragon of Unity
smiles upon you today.

1:03:47.574 --> 1:03:53.078
And in view of the tragedy,
I will accept your offer.

1:03:53.288 --> 1:03:58.709
You will make a fine bride
for my eldest son, Prince Jeeki.

1:04:08.011 --> 1:04:09.512
This is her?

1:04:09.596 --> 1:04:11.639
She's so old.

1:04:16.186 --> 1:04:20.648
Mulan said she was gonna
finish the mission no matter what.

1:04:20.732 --> 1:04:23.275
But how can she without us?

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:24.735
By taking your place.

1:04:26.363 --> 1:04:27.696
Shang's alive.

1:04:27.781 --> 1:04:30.324
Shang, you're alive. You're alive.

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:35.287
Mulan was right.

1:04:35.372 --> 1:04:37.873
No one should marry someone
they don't love.

1:04:38.792 --> 1:04:40.084
I'm going to Qui Gong.

1:04:40.168 --> 1:04:42.962
-We're going with you.
-No, you're not. Stay here.

1:04:46.967 --> 1:04:48.884
Would you say that was an order?

1:04:48.969 --> 1:04:52.513
I would say it was a friendly suggestion.

1:04:54.099 --> 1:04:55.182
Let's go.

1:05:08.071 --> 1:05:10.864
Looks like we won't be a team
after all, Mushu.

1:05:13.118 --> 1:05:14.493
Mulan.

1:05:16.162 --> 1:05:20.040
I would give up 1 ,000 pedestals
if I could stop this.

1:05:23.795 --> 1:05:27.673
I doubt even the Golden Dragon
of Unity could stop this now.

1:05:30.552 --> 1:05:32.303
Goodbye, Mushu.

1:06:16.556 --> 1:06:18.807
My people,

1:06:18.892 --> 1:06:24.146
the Golden Dragon of Unity,
who guides us in all we do,

1:06:24.230 --> 1:06:29.985
today sanctifies a union that will be
a blessing for all of Qui Gong.

1:06:45.043 --> 1:06:46.418
Of course I wanna stop it.

1:06:46.503 --> 1:06:48.629
But what can one itty-bitty dragon do?

1:06:48.713 --> 1:06:51.423
With the tying of this sash,

1:06:51.508 --> 1:06:56.970
we shall unite not only two lives,
but two kingdoms.

1:07:00.684 --> 1:07:03.227
-It's General Li Shang.
-He's alive.

1:07:08.566 --> 1:07:11.110
Yeah, Shang to the rescue.

1:07:11.194 --> 1:07:14.279
Lucky for Lord Chin,
because I was about to whip his butt.

1:07:20.078 --> 1:07:21.120
You're alive.

1:07:21.204 --> 1:07:22.996
I couldn't let you get married
without me.

1:07:23.081 --> 1:07:25.207
General, this is outrageous.

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:28.961
-You will leave at once.
-I'm not going anywhere.

1:07:29.921 --> 1:07:32.840
-What are you doing?
-I don't know. I'm winging it.

1:07:32.924 --> 1:07:36.301
How dare you trample
upon this sacred ceremony?

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:39.138
Oh, my gosh, he's gonna lower
the hammer on Shang.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:42.057
Where is the dang Dragon of Unity
when you need him?

1:07:44.477 --> 1:07:46.311
Don't bother me now, Cri-Kee, I. . .

1:07:49.607 --> 1:07:52.818
I have an idea.

1:07:53.486 --> 1:07:57.030
My lord, I love Mulan,
and I don't care what the rules say.

1:07:57.323 --> 1:08:01.785
If she'll have me, I intend to marry her
right here, right now.

1:08:01.870 --> 1:08:04.079
Insolent dog.

1:08:04.164 --> 1:08:05.289
Seize him.

1:08:05.373 --> 1:08:06.874
-Shang.
-Mulan.

1:08:10.462 --> 1:08:14.006
Yo, what's with all this drama?

1:08:15.675 --> 1:08:19.011
The Golden Dragon of Unity. He lives.

1:08:19.095 --> 1:08:20.304
Mushu?

1:08:28.021 --> 1:08:30.105
You dang right, I live.

1:08:30.190 --> 1:08:33.066
So you best drop
your dumpling-eating behind on down

1:08:33.151 --> 1:08:35.569
and tell me why we ain't busting out
the vows already?

1:08:35.653 --> 1:08:41.533
But, Your Greatness, General Li Shang
is not a son of Qui Gong.

1:08:41.659 --> 1:08:43.160
Silence!

1:08:44.496 --> 1:08:48.123
I am the Golden Dragon of Unity.

1:08:48.208 --> 1:08:51.710
And I decide whom to unify.

1:08:52.212 --> 1:08:58.217
My all-seeing eye has peered
into the very heart of China.

1:08:58.593 --> 1:09:03.764
And I've never seen two people
more right for one another

1:09:03.848 --> 1:09:07.726
than this lovely couple right here,
Mulan and Shang.

1:09:08.144 --> 1:09:09.770
Give it up for them, would you please?

1:09:10.939 --> 1:09:13.774
Now, I command you
to proceed at once.

1:09:13.858 --> 1:09:15.984
Yes, Your Greatness, as you command.

1:09:16.069 --> 1:09:18.654
Now let's get down to business.
Mulan, do you love Shang?

1:09:18.738 --> 1:09:20.155
Of course you do.
Shang, do you love Mulan?

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:21.490
Yes, very much, moving on.

1:09:21.574 --> 1:09:24.576
By the power vested in me, by me.

1:09:24.661 --> 1:09:28.038
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1:09:28.122 --> 1:09:29.915
You got anything to say,
Lord Double Chin?

1:09:31.334 --> 1:09:32.709
Yes. I mean, no.

1:09:32.794 --> 1:09:35.128
I mean, whatever you say.

1:09:42.762 --> 1:09:45.472
And furthermore, I hereby decree

1:09:45.557 --> 1:09:47.724
that the princesses
of the Middle Kingdom,

1:09:47.809 --> 1:09:48.851
wherever they may be,

1:09:48.935 --> 1:09:53.856
are released from their vow and
may marry whomsoever they please.

1:09:53.940 --> 1:09:56.233
And who pleases them,
that's very important.

1:09:56.818 --> 1:09:58.151
Honey pie.

1:10:49.495 --> 1:10:52.998
I can't believe
I'm back on wake-up duty.

1:10:54.334 --> 1:10:56.919
Well, Mulan is happy.

1:10:57.003 --> 1:10:59.671
And if she's happy, I'm happy.

1:11:01.424 --> 1:11:02.966
Thank you, Cri-Kee.

1:11:03.051 --> 1:11:04.927
I did do good, didn't I?

1:11:05.011 --> 1:11:07.054
Better get your rest, Mushu.

1:11:07.138 --> 1:11:09.181
I have a yoga session at dawn,

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:12.142
and I don't want to be late
for my greetings to the sun.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:14.102
And don't forget.

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:16.897
I like to be awakened
from my beauty sleep

1:11:16.981 --> 1:11:20.192
with a nice long foot massage.

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:22.778
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:34.790
-Shang, what are you doing?
-Watch and see.

1:11:34.874 --> 1:11:38.085
-What is he doing?
-It can't be.

1:11:38.169 --> 1:11:40.963
He's combining the family temples.

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:42.172
No.

1:11:42.256 --> 1:11:45.133
Excuse me,
what does that mean exactly?

1:11:45.218 --> 1:11:46.426
You know, for me?

1:11:46.511 --> 1:11:47.761
It means. . .

1:11:47.845 --> 1:11:49.680
Yeah, what, what? It means what?

1:11:49.764 --> 1:11:54.518
Unfortunately,
you get to keep your pedestal.

1:11:54.602 --> 1:11:56.311
Yeah.

1:11:56.396 --> 1:11:57.938
I'm back, baby.

1:11:58.022 --> 1:12:00.148
I am back!

1:12:02.485 --> 1:12:03.610
Yes.

1:12:06.864 --> 1:12:09.658
So this is the famous Mushu?

1:12:10.952 --> 1:12:13.996
Somehow I pictured you bigger.

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:15.747
Say what?

1:12:15.832 --> 1:12:18.500
You told him about me? About us?

1:12:19.252 --> 1:12:22.170
I have no secrets
from my husband, Mushu.

1:12:22.255 --> 1:12:24.339
I told him everything.

1:12:24.757 --> 1:12:27.592
"Everything" everything?

1:12:27.677 --> 1:12:31.596
That's right,
Great Golden Dragon of Unity.

1:12:34.475 --> 1:12:35.892
I still don't get it.

1:12:35.977 --> 1:12:38.186
What does combining our temples do?

1:12:38.271 --> 1:12:41.148
It gives me back my pedestal.

1:12:42.233 --> 1:12:44.067
Wait, but can you do this?

1:12:44.152 --> 1:12:46.319
-Aren't there rules?
-Of course.

1:12:46.404 --> 1:12:48.697
Right next to the rules
about dressing up like a man

1:12:48.781 --> 1:12:50.198
and joining the army.

1:12:51.451 --> 1:12:52.534
Well, what do you know?

1:12:52.618 --> 1:12:54.786
This thing just might work out after all.

1:12:56.539 --> 1:12:59.124
Hey, yo, where's my masseuse?

1:12:59.208 --> 1:13:01.918
Saving China gives me knots
like you wouldn't believe.

1:13:02.837 --> 1:13:04.296
And what about my pedicure?

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:06.298
Let's get jamming on the toe jam,
people.

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:08.008
And somebody heat up some oil.

1:13:08.092 --> 1:13:10.218
I don't know
what we're gonna do with it yet,

1:13:10.303 --> 1:13:12.220
but it's gonna be good.

1:13:12.305 --> 1:13:14.639
Does a hero dragon
deserve anything less?

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:16.058
Draw my bath.

1:13:16.142 --> 1:13:21.480
Warm my towels.
Let the pampering begin.
