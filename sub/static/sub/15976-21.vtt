00:01.775 --> 00:03.242
<i>SIMON: "Then the sloth said,</i>

00:03.244 --> 00:04.943
<i>That's not necessarily so."</i>

00:04.945 --> 00:06.645
And Caveman Boy said,

00:06.647 --> 00:07.946
(childlike): "Tell me
you'll never leave me,

00:07.948 --> 00:10.449
Stupidest Dodo and Littlest Mammoth."

00:10.451 --> 00:13.585
(goofy voice): "I wish we didn't have to,

00:13.587 --> 00:15.420
but we're going extinct.

00:15.422 --> 00:18.323
(chuckles) I'm the last one of me."

00:18.325 --> 00:19.558
Yeah!"

00:19.560 --> 00:21.360
said the Stupidest Dodo.

00:21.362 --> 00:24.696
And the Littlest Mammoth
turned to Caveman Boy and said,

00:24.698 --> 00:27.332
(sweetly): "Don't worry, Caveman Boy..."

00:27.334 --> 00:30.133
We get it... you can do
voices. Just read it normally.

00:30.271 --> 00:32.484
Look, when you grow up and
volunteer your time, you can do

00:32.485 --> 00:35.354
whatever your critical little
heart desires, but right now,

00:35.356 --> 00:36.522
I'm driving this train, okay?

00:36.524 --> 00:37.345
(annoyed sigh)

00:37.675 --> 00:39.496
"Don't worry, Caveman Boy..."

00:39.500 --> 00:42.501
What an ebullient soul he
is to bestow us his time

00:42.513 --> 00:45.480
and his verbal dexterity,

00:45.482 --> 00:48.517
all to inspire the neighborhood progeny.

00:48.519 --> 00:51.219
I think you just said you
appreciate him volunteering here

00:51.221 --> 00:53.121
and he has a healthy prostate?

00:53.123 --> 00:55.624
Oh, I see you share your
father's flair for badinage.

00:55.626 --> 00:56.858
"Even though we're going

00:56.860 --> 00:59.694
extinct, we'll be with you forever.

00:59.696 --> 01:01.863
"Because when you truly love something,

01:01.865 --> 01:04.366
it can never go away.'"

01:04.367 --> 01:06.167
Does that mean my grandma's coming back?

01:06.169 --> 01:07.736
And my dog?

01:07.738 --> 01:09.137
I'm sorry, boys and girls, but there's no

01:09.139 --> 01:11.206
question and answer
period after story time.

01:11.228 --> 01:13.528
But these are good issues
to discuss with your parents

01:13.530 --> 01:15.630
in what I'm sure will be
an uncomfortable ride home.

01:15.632 --> 01:16.931
Tough crowd.

01:16.933 --> 01:18.433
Who picked this book?

01:18.435 --> 01:20.135
Yeah, but the moral was so sweet.

01:20.137 --> 01:22.203
If you truly love something,
it'll never go away.

01:22.205 --> 01:24.239
Oh, that's ludicrous.

01:24.241 --> 01:26.374
I love this library, and
they're taking it away.

01:26.376 --> 01:27.842
They're shutting it down.

01:27.844 --> 01:30.745
What? That's terrible. I feel
like I grew up in this library.

01:30.747 --> 01:32.213
But don't you worry, Flora...

01:32.215 --> 01:35.183
(goofy voice): we're not
letting you go extinct. Ha!

01:35.185 --> 01:36.651
God, the kid was right.

01:36.653 --> 01:38.553
These voices really are annoying. Ooh.

01:38.555 --> 01:40.788
<i>GORDON: Okay.</i>

01:40.790 --> 01:42.666
Listen up. We got terrible news.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.656
UPS is dropping us. It's a catastrophe.

01:45.668 --> 01:47.787
- Gordon, stop hitting the panic button, okay?
- I'm not panicking!

01:47.801 --> 01:48.996
- Breathe for me. Shh.
- I'm just trying to tell you

01:49.102 --> 01:50.602
that we have to replace them

01:50.604 --> 01:51.936
with somebody else immediately

01:51.938 --> 01:53.404
so everybody thinks that we're still

01:53.406 --> 01:54.839
at the top of our game, you understand?

01:54.841 --> 01:56.975
I don't care who it is...
uh, it can be tobacco,

01:56.977 --> 01:58.710
- No... No...
- Big pharma, little pharma,

01:58.712 --> 01:59.744
North Korea!

01:59.746 --> 02:02.080
Lauren, get me Kim Jong-Un

02:02.082 --> 02:03.214
on the phone, darling.

02:03.216 --> 02:04.449
Lauren, do not get Kim
Jong-Un on the phone.

02:04.451 --> 02:05.483
You'll wake Dennis Rodman.

02:05.485 --> 02:06.984
Listen to me, UPS is not that big

02:06.986 --> 02:08.318
- an account with us, Gordon... come on!
- Yeah.

02:08.321 --> 02:10.020
We only had their
hazardous material shipping.

02:10.023 --> 02:12.590
<i>- Yeah.
- "We will touch it with a ten-foot pole."</i>

02:12.592 --> 02:13.791
Yeah, but, you see, that's money.

02:13.793 --> 02:15.359
So, right now, our top priority

02:15.361 --> 02:17.395
is gonna be landing a new client.

02:17.397 --> 02:19.063
I would argue that our
top priority should be

02:19.065 --> 02:21.632
to save the East Naperville Public Library.

02:21.634 --> 02:23.768
What the hell are you talking about?

02:23.770 --> 02:24.869
I made a promise to a boozy librarian

02:24.871 --> 02:26.204
that we would come to the rescue.

02:26.206 --> 02:27.538
SYDNEY: They're about to have a big vote

02:27.540 --> 02:29.373
in East Naperville to
raise taxes; right now,

02:29.375 --> 02:31.275
they're gonna say no and then
the library's gonna close.

02:31.277 --> 02:32.977
Who gives a crap? Shut it down.

02:32.979 --> 02:35.680
Shut down that stupid
book museum right now!

02:35.682 --> 02:38.115
Absolutely not! I gave them my word!

02:38.117 --> 02:39.950
That's why we're gonna do the
best pro bono work of our lives.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.018
P... Pro bono?

02:41.020 --> 02:43.254
- Pro bono.
- That just made my stent slip.

02:43.256 --> 02:45.856
Okay, I'll tell you what. Since you're
not gonna let me talk you out of it,

02:45.858 --> 02:49.529
I'm gonna tell you how much dough I'm
gonna give you for your pro bono project.

02:49.542 --> 02:50.520
- You ready?
- Ready.

02:50.522 --> 02:51.567
- Nada.
- Ha-ha.

02:51.570 --> 02:54.765
You know what that is?
That's Spanish for "no dough."

02:54.767 --> 02:58.169
(laughs) That would've killed in Accounts.

02:58.171 --> 02:59.093
You're such a villain!

02:59.172 --> 03:01.305
All you're missing is a poison
apple and a magic mirror!

03:02.807 --> 03:04.675
Oh, you haven't even begun

03:05.177 --> 03:07.602
to see the evil queen that I can be.

03:07.913 --> 03:10.581
(wheezy laughter)

03:10.583 --> 03:12.549
I'm sorry.

03:13.551 --> 03:14.847
That would kill in Accounts!

03:32.104 --> 03:33.970
Hey, where are you guys coming from?

03:33.972 --> 03:36.673
Oh, we went to that new
Greek place. It was so good.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.308
Oh, I... kind of thought

03:38.310 --> 03:40.810
you and I were gonna try
that restaurant, Andrew.

03:40.812 --> 03:42.379
Did we talk about that?

03:42.381 --> 03:43.680
No. No, no, no, we didn't.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.283
Uh, outside of work, we
barely talk at all anymore.

03:46.285 --> 03:48.251
Wouldn't hurt you to pick
up the phone once in a while.

03:48.253 --> 03:49.577
- What's happening?
- You know, it's okay.

03:49.578 --> 03:50.983
You can make it up to me tonight.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.570
We'll go for a drink after work.

03:52.624 --> 03:55.592
Uh, well, Allie and I were
actually gonna go to a movie

03:55.594 --> 03:58.928
tonight, so, uh, rain check?

03:58.930 --> 04:00.730
(quietly): What about us, man?

04:00.732 --> 04:02.552
What happened to Zach and Andrew?

04:02.559 --> 04:03.858
Aka Zandrew.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.193
Nothing happened to
Zandrew. There's just...

04:05.195 --> 04:08.229
Allie and Andrew now, too. aka Aandrew.

04:08.231 --> 04:11.032
You just said "Andrew."
That's just your name.

04:11.034 --> 04:12.567
No, there was actually a second "A"

04:12.569 --> 04:14.335
if you were eavesdropping closely.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.337
Hey, Zach, why don't you just
come to the movie with us?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.315
No, thank you. I don't
want your pity invite.

04:18.315 --> 04:19.456
What movie?

04:19.809 --> 04:21.309
Oh, it's a documentary about...

04:21.310 --> 04:22.710
I said, "No, thank you"!

04:26.181 --> 04:28.449
Hey. Excuse me.

04:28.451 --> 04:30.518
I'm looking for Sydney Roberts.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.754
Can you tell her that Dylan is here?

04:32.756 --> 04:35.023
Uh, she's in her office. Come with me.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.258
Who's the cute fruit?

04:37.260 --> 04:39.193
Fruit? Oh, no. Sydney's neighbor.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.728
I'm pretty sure they went on a date.

04:40.730 --> 04:42.764
Okay, first of all,
never question my gaydar.

04:42.766 --> 04:43.798
It's impeccable.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.501
And I also have him on
my Grindr app right now.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.768
Is that a sandwich app?

04:47.770 --> 04:49.730
- Oh, there's meat involved.
- But it really seemed

04:49.732 --> 04:51.506
from the way Sydney's
been talking about Dylan

04:51.508 --> 04:52.473
that she's dating him.

04:52.475 --> 04:53.915
Well, you obviously misunderstood.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.610
He's clearly her new gay friend.

04:55.612 --> 04:57.612
You can just say "friend."

04:57.614 --> 04:59.280
Actually, you know what, Dylan,
can you excuse me for one second?

04:59.282 --> 05:01.082
I'll meet you at the elevators.
I have a quick work thing

05:01.084 --> 05:02.650
- to discuss with my coworkers.
- Sure.

05:02.652 --> 05:04.319
- Sure, sweetie.
- Okay.

05:04.321 --> 05:07.488
- So, what do you think? He's cute, right?
- Yeah.

05:07.490 --> 05:09.991
I can't believe we're... I guess, dating.

05:09.993 --> 05:11.392
- Dating?
- What?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.994
I know it's weird because he's...

05:12.996 --> 05:14.495
well, you know...

05:14.497 --> 05:16.664
my neighbor.

05:16.666 --> 05:18.599
- Right. The neighbor.
- Neighbor.

05:18.601 --> 05:20.635
- It's so awkward with neighbors.
- Right.

05:20.637 --> 05:22.060
Yeah, so, you know, we're
gonna take things nice and slow,

05:22.061 --> 05:24.572
but I'm excited. What do you guys think?

05:25.474 --> 05:27.174
He's fabulous.

05:27.176 --> 05:28.643
- Fabu!
- Right?

05:32.651 --> 05:34.185
Good morning, campers.

05:34.187 --> 05:38.923
Ooh, how was your date
with Dylan last night?

05:38.925 --> 05:40.692
Oh, it was so good. I
dragged him to the mall,

05:40.694 --> 05:42.802
- and he didn't complain once.
- Mmm.

05:42.818 --> 05:44.595
<i>Then we went back to his
house and we watched 300.</i>

05:44.597 --> 05:45.930
Ah, he's into gladiators.

05:45.932 --> 05:47.532
Typical guy.

05:47.534 --> 05:48.966
(goofy chuckle) So typical.

05:48.968 --> 05:50.201
(whispers): We have got to tell her.

05:50.203 --> 05:52.003
No. It's like the
spinach-in-your-teeth thing.

05:52.005 --> 05:53.838
If you tell someone, it
could be really embarrassing

05:53.840 --> 05:55.073
and they shoot the messenger.

05:55.075 --> 05:56.340
Yeah, but what do you suggest then?

05:56.342 --> 05:57.708
Let's just let the gay spinach work itself

05:57.710 --> 05:59.010
out of her teeth naturally.

05:59.012 --> 06:00.611
I mean, at some point,
he's gonna braid her hair

06:00.613 --> 06:02.547
and then she'll know, and
then she won't have to know

06:02.549 --> 06:04.982
- that we ever knew.
- I just can't believe she doesn't know.

06:04.984 --> 06:06.584
I know, it's insane.

06:06.586 --> 06:08.753
Guess who just worked out
with their new buddy, Dylan.

06:08.755 --> 06:09.887
- Sydney's Dylan?
- Mm-hmm.

06:09.889 --> 06:11.355
Yeah, Syd introduced us,

06:11.357 --> 06:12.657
and then, out of the blue,

06:12.659 --> 06:13.925
he asked me to do CrossFit with him.

06:13.927 --> 06:14.486
- Oh, really?
- Oh.

06:14.488 --> 06:16.494
Complimented me the entire time.

06:16.496 --> 06:17.762
Said that he loved my top.

06:17.764 --> 06:19.530
His word: classy.

06:19.532 --> 06:21.699
- Zach...
- Now there's a guy in a relationship

06:21.701 --> 06:22.867
who still makes time for his friends,

06:22.869 --> 06:24.001
unlike some people I know,

06:24.003 --> 06:26.036
who only hang out with their girlfriend.

06:26.038 --> 06:27.238
I'm talking about you.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.039
- Yeah, you were looking right at me.
- SIMON: Guys...

06:29.041 --> 06:30.541
let's go save a library.

06:30.543 --> 06:32.143
Great! Love your top!

06:32.145 --> 06:33.344
That is classy.

06:33.346 --> 06:34.879
But it's effeminate, right?

06:34.881 --> 06:35.880
SIMON: "Pro...

06:35.882 --> 06:38.082
bono."

06:39.217 --> 06:40.618
What do these words say to you?

06:40.620 --> 06:42.052
Well, to me it says

06:42.054 --> 06:43.387
you've written the words "pro bono"

06:43.389 --> 06:44.755
on a $5,000 monitor

06:44.757 --> 06:46.290
with what looks to be a permanent marker.

06:46.292 --> 06:48.225
- That's not a good start, is it?
- Well...

06:48.227 --> 06:50.060
If you don't look at it, it
didn't happen. Okay, everybody!

06:50.062 --> 06:51.895
Meeting takes place

06:51.897 --> 06:54.131
down here now.

06:54.133 --> 06:55.966
All right, re-focus.
Because this is charity

06:55.968 --> 06:58.702
and Gordon is evil, he
has taken away our budget!

06:58.704 --> 07:00.070
GORDON (over speaker): And not
just your budget, little man.

07:00.072 --> 07:01.371
(all exclaim)

07:01.373 --> 07:04.041
As long as you're working
on a pro bono project,

07:04.043 --> 07:05.509
you are not being paid!

07:05.511 --> 07:06.877
(laughs evilly)

07:06.879 --> 07:08.545
God, that man really is a villain.

07:08.547 --> 07:10.414
(Zach groans) So we have no budget.

07:10.416 --> 07:11.815
We're working for free.

07:11.817 --> 07:13.016
Time to brainstorm, all right?

07:13.018 --> 07:14.518
Any good ideas, you
write 'em on the monitor.

07:14.520 --> 07:15.919
It's already trashed.

07:15.921 --> 07:17.120
- Okay.
- So, what do we got?

07:17.122 --> 07:18.255
- What about a blimp?
- Yeah.

07:18.257 --> 07:20.123
- Those cost money.
- What about a free one?

07:20.125 --> 07:21.525
Good thinking, but that's not a thing.

07:21.527 --> 07:22.626
- Oh.
- Come on, people.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.261
What pops in your mind
when you hear the word

07:24.263 --> 07:25.395
"library"?

07:25.397 --> 07:27.130
- Uh, bad Wi-Fi.
- Old book smell.

07:27.132 --> 07:28.432
ZACH: No hot chicks.

07:28.434 --> 07:30.133
- Old people smell.
- Like, literally I've never

07:30.135 --> 07:32.135
- seen a girl better than a seven.
- It's impossible to tell which is which.

07:32.137 --> 07:34.104
Places where homeless people masturbate.

07:34.106 --> 07:36.073
No, no, Lauren, Lauren, Lauren, Lauren.

07:36.075 --> 07:38.775
- Yeah?
- I feel the need to speechify.

07:38.777 --> 07:39.910
- Oh!
- Yes.

07:39.912 --> 07:41.077
To me the library

07:41.079 --> 07:42.546
was a magical place, a place

07:42.548 --> 07:44.247
where I could captain a pirate ship,

07:44.249 --> 07:46.750
fly to the moon, walk
through African villages

07:46.752 --> 07:48.218
and see boobs in their native culture.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.419
(imitating African language)

07:49.471 --> 07:51.304
Yeah, but now we can see
all the boobs the world has

07:51.306 --> 07:52.839
to offer with just the click of a mouse.

07:52.841 --> 07:54.708
Yeah, and with books
you can't change the font

07:54.710 --> 07:56.343
or the size of the boobs.

07:56.345 --> 07:57.610
Yeah, and each book is just one book.

07:57.612 --> 07:59.279
I... I'm never doing
just one thing at once.

07:59.281 --> 08:01.548
(text alert chimes) I mean,
even my friend Candice agrees.

08:01.550 --> 08:02.982
Fine! Why don't we just give up

08:02.984 --> 08:04.484
and let them shut down the library?

08:04.486 --> 08:06.853
In fact, why don't we
just burn all the books?

08:09.223 --> 08:11.157
Yeah, why don't we?

08:11.159 --> 08:13.092
(Lauren gasps) What do you think?

08:13.094 --> 08:15.695
"Vote to close the library April 17th.

08:15.697 --> 08:17.697
Book burning celebration to follow."

08:17.699 --> 08:19.866
Yep. Ha! Well, it's...

08:19.868 --> 08:23.403
Book burning generally has a
sort of negative connotation.

08:23.405 --> 08:24.370
True.

08:24.372 --> 08:26.139
Well, uh, the font's pretty.

08:26.141 --> 08:27.307
I love it.

08:27.309 --> 08:29.075
No, you don't, but kudos on ass-kissing.

08:29.077 --> 08:30.143
- Thank you.
- You're outraged,

08:30.145 --> 08:31.177
as you should be.

08:31.179 --> 08:32.611
But rage is what motivates people, huh?

08:32.614 --> 08:34.480
(all talking at once)

08:34.482 --> 08:36.311
- You're doing it again.
- No, I'm about ideas,

08:36.312 --> 08:37.115
not where you write things down.

08:37.118 --> 08:39.419
The people of Naperville
are angry about a tax hike,

08:39.421 --> 08:40.919
so they don't care about the library.

08:40.922 --> 08:43.322
We got to give 'em something
to be even angrier about,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.057
something that'll really push

08:45.059 --> 08:46.092
their buttons.

08:46.094 --> 08:47.660
- ALL: Ooh.
- LAUREN: A, a smelly book.

08:47.662 --> 08:48.694
- No.
- Toaster fire.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.996
- Hairy building.
- No.

08:49.998 --> 08:51.130
- Box on fire.
- Spaghetti trap!

08:51.131 --> 08:52.889
- I love Pictionary.
- It's a burning book!

08:53.034 --> 08:54.200
- Burning book!
- (Simon imitates bell dinging)

08:54.202 --> 08:56.102
We'll make them so mad about burning books,

08:56.104 --> 08:57.303
they won't care about the taxes

08:57.305 --> 08:58.771
and they'll vote to save the library!

08:58.773 --> 08:59.839
Ah, that's genius... you're shifting

08:59.841 --> 09:02.108
the conversation from taxes to libraries.

09:02.110 --> 09:04.176
A vote to close the library
is like a vote to burn books.

09:04.178 --> 09:05.778
Exactly... that is why,
ladies and gentlemen,

09:05.780 --> 09:07.847
we are hosting a book-burning party.

09:07.849 --> 09:08.914
That's a cool concept,

09:08.916 --> 09:10.750
but I feel like it's missing something.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.251
You're right, Andrew, it is a cool concept.

09:12.253 --> 09:14.386
I said I feel like it's missing something.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.488
Sorry, I don't hear criticism.

09:15.490 --> 09:17.223
But I feel like it's missing something.

09:17.225 --> 09:18.424
- Yeah.
- A visual.

09:18.426 --> 09:21.560
A face... a face that people can hate.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.895
Who's hateable and doesn't cost anything?

09:22.897 --> 09:25.097
- Yeah.
- What about something

09:25.099 --> 09:27.166
like this?

09:27.168 --> 09:28.901
Perfect.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.265
Good. That's good.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.608
Oh, Zach, Dylan wants to know
if you want to come with us

09:33.611 --> 09:34.920
to the Gladiator exhibit this weekend.

09:34.966 --> 09:36.098
Oh, that guy sure likes gladiators.

09:36.270 --> 09:37.369
How generous of Dylan

09:37.371 --> 09:40.372
to share his girlfriend time with a friend.

09:40.374 --> 09:42.674
I don't know what top I'm
going to wear, but I'm there.

09:42.676 --> 09:44.509
- It's a date.
- Oh, hey, Simon.

09:44.511 --> 09:46.411
Uh, I added a little red to Gordon's eyes.

09:46.413 --> 09:48.614
Does this read as menacing or meningitis?

09:48.616 --> 09:50.115
Do you think tiny horns would be overkill?

09:50.117 --> 09:51.350
- Yeah, yeah...
- No, what about

09:51.352 --> 09:52.584
Charlie Chaplin's little mustache?

09:52.586 --> 09:53.752
(overlapping chatter)

09:53.754 --> 09:54.720
A nice, big...

09:54.722 --> 09:55.787
GORDON: What the hell is this?

09:55.789 --> 09:56.988
Everyone freeze.

09:56.990 --> 09:57.956
Don't make eye contact.

09:57.958 --> 09:59.558
Eventually he'll go away.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.226
You're using me on the poster?

10:01.228 --> 10:03.195
I'm the face of book-burning?

10:03.197 --> 10:04.863
We didn't have the money to
license a real monster, so...

10:04.865 --> 10:07.432
Oh, is that how you see me... a monster?

10:07.434 --> 10:09.201
Well, if the giant orthopedic shoe fits...

10:09.203 --> 10:10.135
It's not funny, Simon.

10:10.137 --> 10:11.503
- Okay.
- If I'm the bad guy,

10:11.505 --> 10:13.038
it's because you need me to be one.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.308
It serves your pathological
need to be a hero.

10:16.310 --> 10:17.676
You're reducing a very
complex web of neuroses...

10:17.678 --> 10:19.911
Then let me untangle it for you.

10:19.988 --> 10:21.154
Your pro bono crap has

10:21.156 --> 10:23.223
nothing to do with saving the library.

10:23.225 --> 10:25.258
It's all about making sure
that everyone loves you.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.507
And who gives a damn what happens to me?

10:27.509 --> 10:30.810
I'm just Ursula the Sea
Witch to your Little Mermaid.

10:30.812 --> 10:32.946
- Oh, come on, Gordon, I didn't mean...
- Talk to the tentacle.

10:36.350 --> 10:37.550
Gordon, wait.

10:37.552 --> 10:38.518
What?

10:38.520 --> 10:39.919
Oh, I was just doing that thing

10:39.921 --> 10:41.487
where you call out to someone
as they're storming off,

10:41.489 --> 10:42.989
but they don't usually turn around.

10:42.991 --> 10:45.391
I see.

10:46.126 --> 10:47.327
(whispering): No, wait.

10:47.329 --> 10:49.083
SIMON: He's right, it was a bad idea.

10:49.865 --> 10:52.273
- Uh, boss, you know that this already went out, right?
- It did?

10:52.279 --> 10:54.446
- Yeah, hundreds of them.
- Oh, no, no, no, we got to take 'em all down.

10:54.448 --> 10:57.082
- It's too late.
- We... we'll just tell Gordon we took 'em down.

10:57.084 --> 10:58.750
I mean, the election's in two days.

10:58.752 --> 10:59.818
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's just

10:59.820 --> 11:02.153
a little grassroots
campaign in a small town.

11:02.155 --> 11:03.154
(All) Yeah.

11:03.156 --> 11:04.956
Yeah. Yeah. Naperville.

11:04.958 --> 11:08.560
If you check your calendar, it's 2014,

11:08.562 --> 11:10.695
but you sure wouldn't know
it in Naperville, Illinois,

11:10.817 --> 11:12.650
where a group opposed to a tax hike

11:12.652 --> 11:17.455
to save a local library is
organizing a book-burning party

11:17.457 --> 11:21.592
apparently spearheaded by
this unidentified mystery man.

11:21.594 --> 11:22.527
What is wrong with this guy?

11:22.529 --> 11:24.962
What kind of monster burns books?

11:24.964 --> 11:26.297
Around the world, people are asking:

11:26.299 --> 11:29.967
"Who is this madman
and how do we stop him?"

11:29.969 --> 11:31.969
Maybe Gordon doesn't watch the news.

11:31.971 --> 11:33.638
What the hell did you do to me?

11:33.640 --> 11:35.907
And now maybe he's just running
lines for a play he's in?

11:35.909 --> 11:37.708
I'm a pariah out there.

11:37.775 --> 11:39.475
I got egged on the street.

11:39.477 --> 11:41.911
An old lady flicked
her lit cigarette at me.

11:41.913 --> 11:46.749
My latte had a middle
finger drawn in the foam.

11:46.751 --> 11:48.417
Gordon, we are so sorry.
I mean, we never thought

11:48.419 --> 11:49.852
- that this was...
- I don't want to hear it!

11:49.854 --> 11:51.554
I'm blowing your cover.

11:51.556 --> 11:53.389
- No.
- I'm sending out a press release.

11:53.391 --> 11:56.592
Can someone tell me how to
send out a press release?

11:56.594 --> 11:59.428
Or, or we wait till after
the library's been saved.

11:59.430 --> 12:01.030
You'll end up looking like a hero, Gordon.

12:01.182 --> 12:02.214
That was my plan all along.

12:02.216 --> 12:04.483
N... n... n... n... no,
don't play me, Simon.

12:04.485 --> 12:06.051
I'm not playing you, Gordon, you know.

12:06.053 --> 12:08.220
I know right now things look
dire, but a couple of days

12:08.222 --> 12:09.321
from now when we all gather together

12:09.323 --> 12:10.556
for the mock book-burning

12:10.558 --> 12:11.990
and the crowd's there,
ready to lynch you...

12:11.992 --> 12:13.625
- Still looking pretty dire.
- ... we're going to announce

12:13.627 --> 12:15.494
we're not burning the books,
we're saving the library,

12:15.496 --> 12:16.462
and it's all because of you.

12:16.464 --> 12:18.230
You're the man behind it all.

12:18.232 --> 12:19.431
Everyone's going to be cheering for you.

12:19.433 --> 12:20.999
And you'll be the hero this time.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.435
ALL (chanting): Hero, hero...

12:23.437 --> 12:25.204
You just have to have a
little patience, my darling.

12:25.206 --> 12:28.740
Okay, listen, I know you're
pulling this out of your ass.

12:28.742 --> 12:32.911
- No.
- But I do like the idea of being a hero for once.

12:32.913 --> 12:33.912
Yeah.

12:33.914 --> 12:36.114
But what do I do in the meantime?

12:36.116 --> 12:37.549
Hide.

12:37.551 --> 12:39.985
ALL (softly): Hide, hide, hide...

12:39.987 --> 12:42.188
Good luck.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.056
- I'm gonna hide.
- Yeah.

12:44.058 --> 12:45.324
(chanting quietly): hide, hide...

12:48.595 --> 12:51.730
Wow. Just magnificent.

12:51.732 --> 12:54.500
I'm really glad we could all
finally spend some time together.

12:54.502 --> 12:57.036
Oh, yeah. Didn't want to miss this.

12:57.038 --> 12:58.370
Man, look at that spear.

12:58.372 --> 12:59.471
Can you imagine being

12:59.473 --> 13:01.440
- on the business end of that?
- Ooh.

13:01.442 --> 13:03.575
You don't want to miss it for anything.

13:03.577 --> 13:05.010
ZACH: Hey, great tops!

13:05.012 --> 13:07.579
Right on. Book power!

13:07.581 --> 13:09.181
Hey, where's Aaaaandrew... ?

13:09.183 --> 13:10.849
Really? That's a thing?
We're doing that now?

13:10.851 --> 13:13.318
I think they went to go
look at the wall of swords.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.921
Ooh, Zach, do you like swordplay?

13:15.923 --> 13:17.823
Uh, yeah, I'm a guy.

13:17.825 --> 13:19.057
(coughing)

13:19.059 --> 13:20.759
Thank you for bringing me to the museum.

13:20.761 --> 13:23.328
You know me... when it comes
to treating my lady right,

13:23.330 --> 13:25.097
spare no suggested donation.

13:25.099 --> 13:26.331
(chuckles)

13:29.869 --> 13:30.936
Are you okay?

13:30.938 --> 13:33.772
Me? I'm fine.

13:33.774 --> 13:35.140
Yeah, I mean, I'm... I'm here with Dylan.

13:35.142 --> 13:36.908
Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be fine?

13:36.910 --> 13:38.844
Right. You have Dylan.

13:38.846 --> 13:40.779
(men grunting)

13:46.719 --> 13:49.488
(sighs) Lauren, um,

13:49.490 --> 13:50.822
if I tell you something,

13:50.824 --> 13:52.224
you promise you won't tell anyone?

13:52.226 --> 13:53.959
Yeah, of course.

13:53.961 --> 13:55.961
Dylan is...

13:55.963 --> 13:57.762
gay.

13:57.764 --> 13:58.697
What?!

13:58.699 --> 14:00.298
(quieter): What are you saying?

14:00.300 --> 14:01.499
That's crazy.

14:01.501 --> 14:04.035
What? Is everything I knew fake?

14:04.037 --> 14:06.104
Is everything I thought was real

14:06.106 --> 14:08.473
really not real at all?

14:08.475 --> 14:09.574
- You knew?
- I did.

14:09.576 --> 14:11.242
When did you figure it out?

14:11.244 --> 14:13.044
After our fourth date.

14:13.046 --> 14:15.280
When he made me watch a
Raven-Symoné retrospective

14:15.282 --> 14:17.449
and... and he braided my hair.

14:17.451 --> 14:18.817
Oh, the universal tell.

14:18.819 --> 14:19.918
Does everyone know?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.586
DYLAN (in baby talk): Is him wrestled out?

14:21.588 --> 14:22.921
Is him hungry?

14:22.923 --> 14:24.255
Does him want food?

14:24.257 --> 14:25.457
Uh, him... him is hungry.

14:25.459 --> 14:27.625
Him... him... him... him could eat.

14:27.627 --> 14:29.527
Uh... (laughs)

14:29.529 --> 14:30.862
Not everyone.

14:30.864 --> 14:32.530
I mean, Andrew and I figured it out.

14:32.532 --> 14:33.665
He wanted to tell you,

14:33.667 --> 14:35.433
but we didn't want you to feel embarrassed.

14:35.435 --> 14:37.168
Well, that's why I kept it up,

14:37.170 --> 14:38.369
because I felt like an idiot,

14:38.371 --> 14:39.604
and didn't want everyone finding out

14:39.606 --> 14:41.239
and then thinking that I was an idiot.

14:41.241 --> 14:42.707
Which, apparently, they already do.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.342
Are you sure you didn't keep dating him

14:44.344 --> 14:45.309
to make Andrew jealous?

14:45.311 --> 14:46.310
I mean, maybe a little?

14:46.312 --> 14:47.945
No.

14:47.947 --> 14:50.014
I'm... I'm happy that Andrew's happy.

14:50.016 --> 14:51.082
And that he's in love.

14:51.084 --> 14:53.251
And that I get to watch

14:53.253 --> 14:55.720
love bloom every day,
right outside my office.

14:55.722 --> 14:58.456
Oh, good! I thought you'd be bummed.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.725
ZACH: A whole weekend? Just you and me

15:00.727 --> 15:02.393
at your parents' lake house? (laughs): Man!

15:02.395 --> 15:03.961
Andrew is gonna be jealous.

15:03.963 --> 15:05.830
You talk about Andrew a lot.

15:05.832 --> 15:06.831
Did you guys used to date?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.232
(laughing): Date?

15:08.234 --> 15:11.302
No, man, we're just
friends, like you and me.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.209
Oh.

15:18.211 --> 15:21.212
Uh-huh.

15:21.214 --> 15:23.180
O... kay.

15:23.182 --> 15:24.548
Ah!

15:24.550 --> 15:26.450
Uh, him... him... him was not aware.

15:26.452 --> 15:28.085
Him needs a little...

15:28.087 --> 15:29.720
just a little time.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.625
In a few minutes, the
polls are gonna close.

15:36.627 --> 15:37.726
But if we've done our jobs,

15:37.728 --> 15:40.295
these library doors are gonna stay open

15:40.297 --> 15:43.532
because this community said
no to the death of imagination!

15:43.534 --> 15:44.733
ZACH: When the book burners saw us

15:44.735 --> 15:47.169
coming, they ran away

15:47.171 --> 15:48.437
from the power of knowledge!

15:48.439 --> 15:50.539
They were so scared,

15:50.541 --> 15:53.809
they left without their props!

15:53.811 --> 15:55.777
Not even the evil giant
who started this whole thing

15:55.779 --> 15:57.746
had the guts to show his face!

15:57.748 --> 15:59.114
Can I get a whoop-whoop?

15:59.116 --> 16:00.849
(all whooping)

16:00.851 --> 16:01.883
Hey, hey! What's happening?

16:01.885 --> 16:03.785
I thought you were gonna
make me the hero here.

16:03.787 --> 16:05.387
Don't worry... when the vote
is over, I'll bring you out

16:05.389 --> 16:06.955
and reveal that the whole
thing was a campaign to save

16:06.957 --> 16:08.123
the library and you'll reap the glory!

16:08.125 --> 16:09.124
Okay, well hurry up

16:09.126 --> 16:10.692
because my calves are spasming.

16:10.694 --> 16:12.227
- Got it.
- Never should've quit ballet.

16:12.229 --> 16:13.662
Attention, proletariat.

16:13.664 --> 16:15.630
The ballots have been quantified.

16:15.632 --> 16:17.432
And we have emerged

16:17.434 --> 16:20.301
from the hangman's noose unscathed.

16:21.504 --> 16:22.904
Did we win?

16:22.906 --> 16:24.172
That's what I just said.

16:24.174 --> 16:26.040
- We won!
- (all cheering)

16:28.077 --> 16:30.011
You got to make it happen
because I can't feel my legs!

16:30.013 --> 16:31.379
I'm doing it. Everyone?

16:31.381 --> 16:32.981
I have a special surprise.

16:32.983 --> 16:34.983
We would not have won
tonight without the man

16:34.985 --> 16:36.050
I'm about to introduce.

16:36.052 --> 16:38.386
You know him as the face of evil.

16:38.388 --> 16:40.221
- But...
- I can't take it anymore!

16:40.223 --> 16:41.789
- Gordon, Gordon, no... !
- (Gordon muttering)

16:41.791 --> 16:43.324
(crowd gasps, murmurs)

16:43.326 --> 16:45.126
- What are you doing to me?
- MAN: That's him!

16:45.128 --> 16:46.260
- The book hater!
- (all booing)

16:46.262 --> 16:48.062
No, no! No. That isn't who I am.

16:48.064 --> 16:49.097
That's you!

16:49.099 --> 16:50.264
I don't, I don't hate books.

16:50.266 --> 16:52.467
I love books. I'm a reader.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.601
Gordon, Gordon, you're flaming!

16:53.603 --> 16:55.103
I know, it happens when I get nervous.

16:55.105 --> 16:55.903
- No, right there!
- Aah!

16:55.905 --> 16:58.339
Oh! Fire! Bad!

16:58.341 --> 16:59.640
(crowd gasping)

16:59.642 --> 17:00.875
(all scream)

17:00.877 --> 17:02.210
He's burning the books!

17:02.212 --> 17:04.645
No! You're a monster!

17:04.646 --> 17:05.847
Get him!

17:05.848 --> 17:07.781
No, I'm... I'm not a monster!

17:07.784 --> 17:11.085
MAN: Get him! He's a bad man!

17:11.087 --> 17:12.019
He's not bad, he's good!

17:12.021 --> 17:13.287
It's not his fault!

17:13.289 --> 17:14.689
I made him that way!

17:14.691 --> 17:16.958
He's my creation!

17:16.960 --> 17:19.260
Simon, you son of a bitch!

17:19.262 --> 17:20.461
This reminds me of something.

17:20.463 --> 17:22.229
<i>- Twilight?
- Hunger Games?</i>

17:22.231 --> 17:23.564
Seriously?

17:23.566 --> 17:24.734
<i>(cork pops)</i>

17:24.737 --> 17:28.571
"Genius Ad Campaign Revealed."

17:28.574 --> 17:29.974
"Lewis, Roberts & Roberts Saves the Day."

17:29.976 --> 17:32.710
"Homeless Man Arrested for
Masturbating in Library."

17:32.712 --> 17:34.745
See? All is right with the world again.

17:34.747 --> 17:36.981
Whoa, Gordon's on the news.

17:36.983 --> 17:40.251
My thinking was that if we
created a villain character,

17:40.253 --> 17:42.319
that it would change the conversation.

17:42.321 --> 17:45.289
And I volunteered because I care.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.957
Speaking of caring, I'm
sure some of our viewers

17:46.959 --> 17:48.926
want to know how are your injuries

17:48.928 --> 17:50.661
because of the pitchforks?

17:50.663 --> 17:52.363
Numerous and excruciating.

17:52.365 --> 17:55.065
Al... although I was very lucky
that... that church was unlocked,

17:55.067 --> 17:58.268
so I was able to hide
out in the bell tower.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.803
Well, so there we have
it. A nation's villain,

17:59.805 --> 18:02.406
one library's hero.

18:02.408 --> 18:04.241
Uh, Syd? Hey.

18:04.243 --> 18:05.576
I am sorry that Lauren and I didn't

18:05.578 --> 18:07.111
say something sooner about Dylan.

18:07.113 --> 18:08.512
Oh, it's okay.

18:08.514 --> 18:10.214
I mean, the only bummer was that

18:10.216 --> 18:11.315
- I like to hang out with him.
- Ah, sure.

18:11.317 --> 18:12.382
We had a lot in common.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.617
- He's a nice guy.
- Yeah.

18:13.619 --> 18:15.185
Haven't really had that
with anyone in a while.

18:15.187 --> 18:18.088
- Yeah, me neither. (clears throat)
- Except Allie.

18:18.090 --> 18:19.957
Right! No, right, right.

18:19.959 --> 18:22.459
Except Allie, of course,
who's great; she's great.

18:22.461 --> 18:24.328
She's really great. So,
yeah, except for that.

18:24.330 --> 18:25.996
- That's great.
- Okay.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.832
I miss hanging out with you.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.535
You do?

18:31.537 --> 18:34.004
Yeah, I mean, you're, you're a good friend.

18:34.006 --> 18:36.473
I miss you, too... buddy.

18:36.475 --> 18:37.607
(laughs): Okay, cool.

18:37.609 --> 18:38.642
Hey, can I ask you

18:38.644 --> 18:40.610
some really frank sexual advice, actually,

18:40.612 --> 18:41.478
about Allie?

18:41.480 --> 18:42.946
Well, I'm off to grab a beer

18:42.948 --> 18:43.947
with my buddy Dylan.

18:43.949 --> 18:45.282
Wow.

18:45.284 --> 18:47.017
You guys are still hanging out?

18:47.019 --> 18:48.485
Yeah, you know, after we talked

18:48.487 --> 18:50.053
about that kooky misunderstanding,

18:50.055 --> 18:52.355
I realized that D-man is a great guy.

18:52.357 --> 18:54.591
And I'm not just saying
that to make jealous, Andrew.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.259
You and I are totally cool.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.662
I just, I don't know, really
enjoy hanging out with him.

18:58.664 --> 19:00.196
And he's fine that it's platonic?

19:00.198 --> 19:01.231
No, he's totally in love with me.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.465
The Zach bug bit him bad.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.868
But I think I can turn him.

19:06.671 --> 19:08.338
Into a friend.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.573
Well, good luck with that.

19:13.244 --> 19:16.112
Si, I have to say your little
charity stunt worked very well.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.748
We've been getting calls
from new clients all day.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.083
It was all part of my plan.

19:20.085 --> 19:21.251
Oh, please, you had no plan.

19:21.253 --> 19:23.353
You just stumbled upon
a photogenic villain,

19:23.355 --> 19:25.188
and you... you ran with it.

19:25.190 --> 19:26.289
Well, it's your sweaty
Mediterranean features...

19:26.291 --> 19:27.524
they photograph well, my friend.

19:27.526 --> 19:28.825
(laughs) Yeah.

19:28.827 --> 19:30.493
- Touché.
- We make a good team, my man.

19:30.495 --> 19:32.161
- Yeah, we do.
- You're the Beast to my Beauty.

19:32.163 --> 19:34.998
- Oh.
- The Garfunkel to my Simon.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.100
See? That works on two levels
because my name is Simon...

19:37.102 --> 19:38.534
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. Very clever.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.503
- Thank you.
- But no one really ever appreciated Garfunkel.

19:40.505 --> 19:42.196
- Well, Simon did.
- What do you mean? He...

19:42.197 --> 19:43.697
he broke up with him famously.

19:43.742 --> 19:46.109
- For a while they had a nice time.
- Didn't they sue each other?

19:46.111 --> 19:48.044
Don't read too much into it.

19:48.046 --> 19:51.180
My point is this place
wouldn't work without you.

19:51.182 --> 19:53.649
Especially when you hear this.

19:53.651 --> 19:54.784
- What?
- I just took a call

19:54.786 --> 19:56.586
for the biggest buyout offer

19:56.588 --> 19:58.254
we've ever had.

19:58.256 --> 20:01.023
We've had offers before. We
will never sell this company!

20:01.025 --> 20:05.027
Uh, $47 million beg to differ

20:05.029 --> 20:07.029
my Little Brony.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.966
Yes, you are about to
become the proud subsidiary

20:09.968 --> 20:12.702
of Hamasaki Sneakers, Cutlery...

20:12.704 --> 20:15.071
and now... Advertising.

20:15.073 --> 20:16.172
I should've never let
that sympathetic priest

20:16.174 --> 20:17.840
let you out of the bell tower!

20:17.842 --> 20:19.608
We are selling. End of discussion.

20:19.610 --> 20:20.843
No!

20:20.845 --> 20:22.611
What I wouldn't give for
a lit torch right now!

20:22.613 --> 20:23.712
You're a monster!

20:23.714 --> 20:24.980
You made me this way!

20:31.088 --> 20:32.454
No, hefe, tell me this.

20:32.456 --> 20:34.123
(both shouting gibberish)

20:35.959 --> 20:37.226
But now you can see boob...

20:37.228 --> 20:38.827
now you can see all the boobs.

20:38.829 --> 20:40.195
Booby booby boo boo.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.031
No hot chicks. I... I've never seen

20:42.033 --> 20:43.999
seen a girl better than a seven.

20:44.001 --> 20:45.768
Place where old people masturbate.

20:45.770 --> 20:46.969
Oh!

20:46.971 --> 20:49.138
- Whoa!
- Old people masturbate in libraries?

20:49.140 --> 20:51.940
What kind of libraries are
you hanging out in, you sicko?

20:51.942 --> 20:54.610
Grandpa, we're ready to go now.

20:54.612 --> 20:56.078
Are you finished? Not yet!
