00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:25.525


00:30.697 --> 00:31.990
Look what we found!

00:32.073 --> 00:33.825
A box of spy gum!

00:33.908 --> 00:36.161
Ah. I never heard of these ones.

00:36.244 --> 00:39.247
Super-stretch melon,
red-hot cinna-splosion…

00:39.330 --> 00:41.291
Oh! What do you think
bouncy blueberry does?

00:41.374 --> 00:42.667
Only one way to find out.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.380
Really hope it doesn't explode.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.174
Hey, toss me some!

00:49.257 --> 00:52.177
I need to refill my… utility satchel?

00:53.636 --> 00:54.471
Hm.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.144
-

01:01.728 --> 01:04.439
-Everyone, hit the deck!

01:05.899 --> 01:08.443
We need to stop that berry
before it takes out an eye!

01:08.526 --> 01:10.695
-Or gets stuck in someone's hair!

01:11.279 --> 01:12.238
I got an idea!

01:18.661 --> 01:23.458
Great. First Rafaela takes over my car,
now the bubblegum does.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.627
What did I just walk in on?

01:26.920 --> 01:27.754
Well…

01:27.837 --> 01:29.589
Stop. I don't care.

01:29.672 --> 01:33.510
We've got a grade-A, level five,
code red emergency on our hands.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.805
Oh no… Did you eat
too much unpasteurized cheese?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.973
I'm not talking about cheese!

01:39.057 --> 01:42.060
I'm talking about
the truck full of experimental weaponry

01:42.143 --> 01:44.229
we've been chasing all over Europe!

01:44.312 --> 01:47.148
Am I the only one
concerned about that?!

01:48.399 --> 01:51.778
What? No. We're totally concerned.

01:51.861 --> 01:56.449
Well, I'm glad you're all
having fun failing at your mission!

01:56.533 --> 01:58.493
Interesting you call it a mission.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.787
I call it cleaning up your mess.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.874
Then it's a good thing you're here,
because messes are your forte!

02:07.710 --> 02:08.920
Oh yeah!

02:09.003 --> 02:11.422
You need some ointment for that sick burn?

02:11.506 --> 02:14.217
Who's feeling me?

02:17.011 --> 02:18.138
What is that sound?

02:21.349 --> 02:22.433
No! Don't open it!

02:29.899 --> 02:31.442
Oh no.

02:31.526 --> 02:35.655
-Gary, are you okay?
-I guess I'll find out in seven years.

02:38.741 --> 02:43.329
Look, if we don't want to become more
of a laughing stock than we already are,

02:43.413 --> 02:47.667
we need to stop playing with our food,
and start coming up with some answers!

02:47.750 --> 02:49.169
Who's behind the heist?

02:49.252 --> 02:52.714
Where are they taking the weapons,
and what do they want?

02:52.797 --> 02:55.633
Oh, I know exactly what they want.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.551
You do?

02:57.135 --> 02:59.554
Yeah. They want to mess with us.

02:59.637 --> 03:03.141
Trust me, I've been messed with
for the last nine years of my life

03:03.224 --> 03:04.684
by my little sister, Sissy.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.562
I think
this is a little different.

03:07.645 --> 03:08.646
Is it?

03:09.188 --> 03:10.940
All the telltale signs are there.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.902
First we're lured in close,
and given a false sense of security.

03:13.985 --> 03:17.572
Before we know it, we're stuck outside
a bot-con in full foam and vinyl cosplay

03:17.655 --> 03:20.783
because our tickets are fake and
the Velcro was laced with adhesives.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.494
What did Sissy do to you?

03:23.578 --> 03:26.789
-She messed with me.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.668
It's not the same.
We've been chasing down our own leads.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.462
You sure about that?

03:32.545 --> 03:36.174
Whoever we're chasing probably knew
we had access to satellites feeds,

03:36.257 --> 03:37.717
and they must have guessed that

03:37.800 --> 03:40.428
we would search for
the radioactivity from the weapons.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.139
They want us to think
we're coming up with our own leads.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.182
Exactly!

03:44.265 --> 03:46.476
It's so similar to what Sissy does

03:46.559 --> 03:49.896
that I could almost see her
being behind it if she wasn't in LA.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.774
-Bro, Sissy's not in LA, she's in Europe.
-What?

03:52.857 --> 03:55.568
Yeah. I catch up with your moms,
like, once a week.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.196
They fill me in on
all the good Los Gatos gossip.

03:58.279 --> 04:02.700
Did you know that Christine from Kung-pao
Nachos is operating an illegal snail farm?

04:02.784 --> 04:05.245
Snail farm? To eat?

04:05.328 --> 04:07.163
No, she just really likes snails.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.915
Cisco! What about Sissy?!

04:08.998 --> 04:10.625
Oh right, yeah.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.919
Uh, so your moms won some contest,

04:13.002 --> 04:16.923
and now your whole family is on an
all-expense-paid trip through Europe. Huh?

04:17.006 --> 04:18.967
Also, you should
call your moms more often.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.302
-What are you doing?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.096
Checking on a hunch.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.640
Huh… Ah! Here it is.

04:25.723 --> 04:29.727
It appears they won a contest
put on by a sausage company.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.981
Wait, you said "appears,"
but they did win.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.148
Did they?

04:34.232 --> 04:35.733
I thought so?

04:35.817 --> 04:36.985
I'm confused.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.028
-Uh… Ah.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.322
Just as I thought.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.825
There's malware in the contest's program!

04:43.908 --> 04:46.953
My moms didn't win the trip
fair and square. They didn't have to!

04:47.036 --> 04:49.664
-Sissy won it for 'em.
-What are you saying?

04:49.747 --> 04:54.252
I'm saying, the person
who's messing with us is Sissy!

04:54.836 --> 04:56.045
Oh, come on!

04:56.129 --> 04:57.255
It fits!

04:57.338 --> 05:01.009
She's a mad-scientist-level genius
who can hack into anything.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.387
She knows about the supercomputer
in my Yoka head so she has access,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.639
and she's always wanted to join the team,

05:06.723 --> 05:10.018
but we've denied her, so she's got motive.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.563
Also, isn't she in love with Tony?

05:13.646 --> 05:16.107
Aha! A woman scorned!

05:16.190 --> 05:17.191
Huh?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.110
That's ridiculous, okay?

05:19.193 --> 05:21.863
A nine-year-old girl
did not steal from the agency!

05:21.946 --> 05:23.698
Besides, Sissy's family.

05:23.781 --> 05:28.745
Treachery can come from anywhere, Toretto,
most likely from those closest to you.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.622
Oh, so now you're on my side?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.958
I'm fluid.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.588
Check the itinerary.
Let's pop in and say hi to your family.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.012
Ooh, I am going to get Frostee so good!

05:46.095 --> 05:49.974
He's going to think it's <i>Ofenschlupfer</i>,
but then, ha! In your face!

05:50.058 --> 05:52.560
Sissy, you need to go easy on Frostee.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.563
If you keep messing with each other,
one of you will get hurt.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.148
Yeah. Him.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.526
Didn't our guide say
there was a sausage stand around here?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.487
He said a lot of things.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.031
Uh… Tiffany?

06:08.242 --> 06:09.077
No!

06:09.160 --> 06:12.914
<i>Knackwurst! Bratwurst! Blutwurst!</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:15.583
<i>Bregenwurst! Teewurst! Gelbwurst!</i>

06:17.376 --> 06:19.587
<i>-Leberkäse!</i>
<i>-Leberkäse!</i>

06:19.670 --> 06:22.298
-Did you bring that extra suitcase?
-Better.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.593
Moms, come on!
We have a schedule to keep here!

06:25.676 --> 06:27.470
Baby girl, I love you,

06:27.553 --> 06:30.848
but you better step away
before I throw you in some lederhosen!

06:35.394 --> 06:37.105
Are you ready to go?

06:37.188 --> 06:42.318
Of course I am, because I understand
the importance of keeping a schedule,

06:42.401 --> 06:46.614
and it really annoys me
when I go out of my way to be on time,

06:46.697 --> 06:47.949
but then I'm forced to wait

06:48.032 --> 06:51.327
because less disciplined people
do whatever they want whenever they want!

06:51.911 --> 06:54.038
Uh… okay.

07:00.753 --> 07:03.840
All right,
we got the sausages.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.676
Now let's make like a brötchen and roll.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.929
-Because a brötchen is a roll!

07:10.012 --> 07:11.139
Finally.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.535
There it is, a few miles ahead.
We're closing in.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.871
Four people are inside.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.957
Get to your cars
and be ready for anything.

07:40.042 --> 07:44.505
Did you know that Germany has
a population of 81 million people?

07:44.589 --> 07:46.007
Oh, and look at this.

07:46.090 --> 07:50.845
One of its longest words is
<i>"Betäubungsmittelver."</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:53.306
What's that mean?

07:53.389 --> 07:55.600
-Is something wrong?

07:56.642 --> 07:57.810
I really hope not.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.688
That would make
Mrs. Pepperpants very cross.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.691
Hey, what's that?

08:03.774 --> 08:04.984
An air freshener.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.986
Ew, is that sandalwood?

08:31.344 --> 08:34.138
Oh, man!
My seat's all messed up from Rafaela!

08:34.222 --> 08:36.015
Where the heck is her lumbar located?!

08:55.743 --> 08:58.496
It's one of those dudes
in one of those crazy suits!

08:58.579 --> 08:59.997
Frostee, you were right!

09:00.081 --> 09:03.417
Wait, is that Sissy? She got a lot taller!

09:03.501 --> 09:06.295
Of course it's not Sissy. She's the boss!

09:06.379 --> 09:08.631
Bosses don't
climb out of SUVs to do battle.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.549
<i>Good point.</i>

09:09.632 --> 09:11.050
So, what's the play here?

09:11.634 --> 09:15.304
We take 'em in, nice and easy.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.445
What just happened?!

09:32.029 --> 09:34.824
That dude disappeared.
I think we scared him!

09:34.907 --> 09:36.826
I think we were set up.

09:36.909 --> 09:37.994
What?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.999
Who's driving that thing?!

09:43.583 --> 09:46.085
Three people are inside,
and two appear to be asleep.

09:47.253 --> 09:51.799
We were set up,
and my family's in that runaway SUV!

09:51.882 --> 09:53.634
We need to stop it now!

10:05.521 --> 10:06.606
Who's firing on us?

10:06.689 --> 10:10.192
I don't know, but we gotta do something
to stop it from wrecking out!

10:13.821 --> 10:14.989
What's going on?!

10:20.536 --> 10:23.039
<i> Moms? Sissy? Are you there?</i>

10:23.122 --> 10:25.916
<i>Wake up! Sissy! Anybody?</i>

10:26.000 --> 10:28.044
Frostee, is that your annoying voice?

10:28.127 --> 10:32.632
Sissy! Oh, thank goodness.
The SUV you're in is out of control!

10:32.715 --> 10:36.093
Hold on, is this some kind of
elaborate practical joke?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.095
Are you trying to teach me a lesson?

10:38.179 --> 10:41.432
No, this is not a joke,
this is life or death!

10:41.515 --> 10:43.893
Also, what kind of lesson
would we be teaching you?!

10:43.976 --> 10:47.063
I don't know. You guys are
the one that thought this up.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.648
<i>We didn't think it up!</i>

10:48.731 --> 10:50.483
That's what you would say if you did.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.629
Now what do we do?!
It's drifting toward oncoming traffic!

11:11.712 --> 11:13.130
I got an idea!

11:19.762 --> 11:21.347
Nice shooting, Gum Neck!

11:23.307 --> 11:25.226
Wait, was that a real laser?

11:25.309 --> 11:26.143
<i>Yes!</i>

11:29.146 --> 11:31.148
-

11:35.152 --> 11:38.030
This screen says, "Auto Armed."

11:38.114 --> 11:41.367
This isn't a joke! I'm in the middle of
an actual spy mission!

11:41.450 --> 11:43.369
Is she cheering?

11:43.452 --> 11:45.788
Ugh. She's always wanted to be a spy.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.708
So, what's the mission? Who are we after?
Do I need to punch someone?!

11:49.792 --> 11:50.918
<i>No!</i>

11:51.001 --> 11:53.254
The car you're in is out of control.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.466
So, I'm the victim?
And Tony's trying to save me?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.551
Aw…

11:58.634 --> 12:03.305
Though I'm not the type who needs saving!
Still, it's nice to have the attention.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.599
Listen, you need to stop the SUV.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.352
Hit the brakes!
Grab the wheel! Do something!

12:08.436 --> 12:10.479
You're really not a good teacher.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.239
It looks like
the steering system's being overridden.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.701
The brakes are out and the car
is being programmed to speed up!

12:23.784 --> 12:24.827
So intense.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.004
We need to disable those weapons!
We can't get close!

12:35.588 --> 12:37.423
-I'll try to hack in!

12:39.508 --> 12:41.760
-Oh, no. Look at this!

12:44.180 --> 12:47.099
Team, we got another problem.
There's a bend in the road ahead.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.060
<i> If we don't get ahold of that SUV…</i>

12:50.144 --> 12:53.230
Sissy, send me your access point.
I might be able to help.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.191
Wait, I think I see something.

12:55.274 --> 12:59.028
I can't override the lasers, but they're
currently programmed at off-set intervals,

12:59.111 --> 13:00.654
and I may be able to synch them.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.823
I have no idea what you're saying!

13:02.907 --> 13:06.702
She's saying she might be able to
stop those lasers for ten seconds.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.288
-Do it!

13:19.798 --> 13:23.761
I got it! Here it is!
We got ten seconds starting… now!

13:25.804 --> 13:26.972
Team, move in!

13:33.229 --> 13:34.897
-Locked on.
-Me too!

13:39.151 --> 13:42.947
-Alright, Sissy! Yeah!

13:43.030 --> 13:47.034
Yeah, you did it!
Sissy, I'm so proud of you!

13:47.117 --> 13:49.036
<i>Thanks. I guess I'm just a…</i>

13:53.707 --> 13:56.752
-You're doing the song wrong.
<i>-Yeah, I'm making it better.</i>

13:56.835 --> 13:57.711
Worse!

13:57.795 --> 13:58.963
You're worse!

14:05.010 --> 14:06.303
They can't get us!

14:06.887 --> 14:08.055
But we can get them.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.480
-Oh no, not again.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.357
More sharp turns ahead!

14:18.440 --> 14:22.111
We need to get
Sissy and my moms out of that car!

14:22.194 --> 14:26.657
Tony, keep those guns trained on you.
Everyone else, hold that car steady!

14:27.950 --> 14:29.618
And what are you doing?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.829
-I'm going in.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.289
Can I borrow your purse?

14:47.636 --> 14:48.762
No way.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.192
You ready to get our moms out of here?

15:02.276 --> 15:03.736
I'm ready for any mission!

15:04.445 --> 15:05.279
Aw!

15:05.362 --> 15:07.823
She looks so peaceful
when she's sleeping!

15:07.907 --> 15:10.576
That's pretty much
the only time she's peaceful.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.081
All aboard!

15:16.165 --> 15:16.999
Get the door.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.508
Your turn!

15:34.224 --> 15:36.685
Hurry up!
We can't hold this thing much longer!

15:40.522 --> 15:42.983
This way!

15:50.199 --> 15:51.200
We have to jump.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.453
You scared?

15:54.536 --> 15:58.040
Are you kidding me?
This is the greatest moment of my life!

15:58.123 --> 16:00.584
Well, hopefully it's not the last moment!

16:00.668 --> 16:01.502
Jump!

16:03.629 --> 16:04.630
I got 'em!

16:10.844 --> 16:12.012
Whoa.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.769
<i>Everyone regroup in the hauler.</i>

16:18.852 --> 16:20.980
-Copy that.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.525
What now?

16:34.660 --> 16:37.287
Well, looks like it happened again.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.580
I know.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.915
We were lured in.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.041
I know!

16:45.087 --> 16:47.589
Anybody have any idea
who these people might be?

16:47.673 --> 16:50.342
<i>No, but who cares? Let's get out of here!</i>

16:50.426 --> 16:53.387
<i>We can't leave.</i>
<i>This is our chance to get answers.</i>

16:53.470 --> 16:56.098
<i>Cisco, drop off</i>
<i>Frostee's family in the hauler.</i>

16:56.181 --> 16:58.517
<i>Tony and Layla,</i>
<i>help me take these guys down.</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:00.185
Sounds like a plan.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.828
Two on one? I'm cool with that.

17:24.543 --> 17:27.546
Okay, four on one? Not cool.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.801
Yo, they're targeting me!

17:35.220 --> 17:38.599
-What's happening?
-And who do I need to punch?

17:38.682 --> 17:41.894
What's happening is
we got a bogey incoming!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.277
No way!

18:03.207 --> 18:05.459
-They're dragging me in!

18:22.392 --> 18:23.769
Leaving already?

18:25.729 --> 18:26.772
Get on the cannons!

18:28.315 --> 18:30.234
I want to fire laser cannons!

18:33.779 --> 18:36.323
Hold on, Echo! I'm coming!

18:58.470 --> 18:59.805
It's taking off!

19:02.474 --> 19:04.059
<i>Cisco, what are you doing?!</i>

19:04.643 --> 19:07.729
Stopping the plane.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.949
Red hot!

19:21.952 --> 19:23.620
Yeah! I did that!

19:27.457 --> 19:30.878
No! Oh, no!

19:33.547 --> 19:35.048
I'm going in!

19:43.223 --> 19:46.018
-Whoa! That totally worked!

19:51.690 --> 19:53.108
Oh, no, you don't!

20:19.134 --> 20:21.178
Where do you think you're going?

20:51.458 --> 20:52.376
No!

21:11.728 --> 21:12.813
No!

21:16.149 --> 21:17.693
-You again.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.194
Huh?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.780
I guess
I'll have to get rid of you both.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.367
So you're the brains of this operation.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.370
And you're clearly
the most intelligent of your group.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.707
I'm glad it's you that's coming with us.
Perhaps you'll understand.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.477
Now get ready for bounce gum!

22:01.153 --> 22:04.072
-Eh, you'll work too.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.149
