Hey, you got to
get a new ringer.

00:24.237 --> 00:25.504
No way, that way I always
know it's for me.

00:25.572 --> 00:26.872
It's ridiculous.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.241
Hey we gotta roll.

00:29.309 --> 00:30.509
You know Sandy's
a vegetarian.

00:30.577 --> 00:31.211
What?

00:31.212 --> 00:33.445
I don't even have to look at
it to know it's a meat lovers...

00:33.513 --> 00:35.214
How do you know
it's for Sandy?

00:35.281 --> 00:36.682

You can't do that!

Sandy and puppies and...

00:45.024 --> 00:46.357
Okay, all right.

00:46.425 --> 00:48.026
Now without reading my
mind, what am I thinking

00:48.094 --> 00:49.527
about right now?

00:49.595 --> 00:51.096
You got a poker face on;
I imagine you are trying to

00:51.163 --> 00:52.931
make me think that you're
not thinking about

00:52.999 --> 00:56.533
Sandy when you are...
..am I right?

00:56.601 --> 00:58.769
Well you're wrong about
the pizza; it's for Ryder...

00:58.837 --> 00:59.970
He called.

01:00.038 --> 01:01.071
It's for Ryder.

01:01.139 --> 01:02.673
Yeah, let's get going.

01:02.741 --> 01:04.407
Look if I do Ryder a favor
or two he can help me switch

01:04.474 --> 01:07.745
some shifts and I can sync
up with Sandy's schedule...

01:08.579 --> 01:10.080

called nowadays?

hurt his ankle chasing his

02:04.464 --> 02:05.799
Wait a minute;
I wonder if we jinxed it.

A bleeder.

02:07.068 --> 02:08.501
What happened here?

02:08.568 --> 02:10.603
He shot himself.

02:10.670 --> 02:11.905
I thought you guys called
in a broken ankle.

02:11.972 --> 02:13.506
Yeah, he doesn't
have a gun permit.

02:13.574 --> 02:14.973
Look, he's a really good
guy; I thought maybe we'd

02:15.041 --> 02:16.308
avoid the
police, you know.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.177
This looks serious.

02:28.221 --> 02:29.454
Let's get him
to the ambulance.

02:29.522 --> 02:30.788
I think I recognize this
guy from somewhere.

02:30.856 --> 02:33.758
He looks familiar.
Let me get the door here.

he's missed his chance to

08:10.284 --> 08:11.051

09:07.305 --> 09:08.638
BP is falling.

09:08.706 --> 09:10.173
If we don't get him to a
hospital he could die.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.607
Hey shut up.

09:11.675 --> 09:12.842
He's got a bullet in
his leg, that's all.

09:12.910 --> 09:14.476
This is not
what we wanted.

09:14.544 --> 09:16.179
We should just stop.

09:16.246 --> 09:18.380
We can explain to them
that it was an accident.

09:18.448 --> 09:19.816
What are we
going to do huh?

09:19.883 --> 09:21.117
We're going to explain
that we accidentally took

09:21.185 --> 09:22.551
two paramedics
at gunpoint?

09:22.619 --> 09:23.853
Come on!

09:23.921 --> 09:27.622
Please, it was
just... let them go.

09:27.690 --> 09:28.857
[struggle]

09:28.925 --> 09:29.858
Oh my god.

09:29.926 --> 09:30.992
He's going into shock.

09:30.993 --> 09:32.460
We need to get him into
surgery to get this bullet out.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.562
Take the bullet out then.

09:33.563 --> 09:37.498
We don't do that; we're
paramedics, we are not surgeons.

09:37.566 --> 09:40.068
[♪]

09:40.136 --> 09:42.102
I guess you just
go promoted.

09:47.490 --> 09:48.791
Got something
over here.

09:48.858 --> 09:51.560
Let's get those
checked for prints.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.730
I appreciate the call.

09:55.798 --> 09:57.432
You got anything?

09:57.499 --> 09:59.133
We might be able to get
some prints off those.

09:59.501 --> 10:01.101
Have you had any other
contact with them?

10:01.102 --> 10:02.437
No, but you'd be
the first to know.

10:02.504 --> 10:04.372
Is there anything
else you can think of?

10:04.440 --> 10:06.407
Just what I told you;
the victim's name is

10:06.475 --> 10:08.776
Ted Winters, an
office in the building...

10:08.844 --> 10:10.044
Toby and Oz were called to...

10:10.111 --> 10:13.047
<i>The</i> Ted Winters;
the Ponzi schemer?

10:13.048 --> 10:14.281
I don't know.

10:14.350 --> 10:16.516
You said a man and a woman;
did you get any names?

10:16.584 --> 10:19.753
She called her
partner James.

10:19.821 --> 10:21.521
They seemed pretty
much on the edge.

10:21.589 --> 10:24.257
We're going to
get them back.

10:24.325 --> 10:26.159
Yeah.

10:26.227 --> 10:28.126
[♪]

10:28.194 --> 10:29.662
What's the next step?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.497
Check out Winters' office;
I'm going to see what

10:31.565 --> 10:33.399
I can find out
about this James.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.033
With just first
name to go on?

10:35.101 --> 10:37.370
Yeah, maybe he's one of the
guys that Winters ripped off.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.371
Good luck.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.072
Thanks.

10:42.758 --> 10:56.303

10:56.304 --> 11:09.182
[♪]

11:09.183 --> 11:16.589
[♪]

11:16.657 --> 11:19.291
Baby come here;
I have a plan okay.

11:19.359 --> 11:22.093
I want you to keep an eye
on them, I'll be right back.

11:23.062 --> 11:24.963
Come on.

11:25.031 --> 11:27.566
Why are we here?

11:27.634 --> 11:29.100
This is where you're going
to do the thing on the guy.

11:29.169 --> 11:30.369
Here?

11:30.436 --> 11:33.172
No, no, we need a
sterile environment.

11:33.239 --> 11:34.606
What about inside
the ambulance?

11:34.674 --> 11:36.006
It's too tight.

11:36.074 --> 11:38.075
Okay my partner and I we
want to help you guys but

11:38.143 --> 11:39.977
honestly it would be a lot
better if we got this guy

11:40.045 --> 11:41.345
to the hospital.

11:41.413 --> 11:42.680
Listen, I don't think
you guys get it okay.

11:42.747 --> 11:45.249
We need him fixed because
we're not done with him.

11:45.317 --> 11:47.084
We'll clear an area,
we'll do it here.

11:47.152 --> 11:48.886
No.

11:50.955 --> 11:52.622
How hard is it to
take out a bullet?

11:52.690 --> 11:55.758
If we were surgeons it
would be relatively simple.

11:55.826 --> 11:57.994
Enough talking;
you say he needs surgery,

11:58.062 --> 11:59.629
perform the damn surgery.

11:59.697 --> 12:02.499
<i>[esp]: Keep him busy Toby;</i>
<i>I think I have a plan.</i>

12:03.501 --> 12:05.435
Alright. If I'm going
to cut this guy open I don't

12:05.503 --> 12:06.903
know how deep that bullet is.

12:06.970 --> 12:09.438
I need you guys to help
me clear a space here.

12:09.506 --> 12:11.640
[inaudible]
everything has gone wrong...

12:11.708 --> 12:12.908
...maybe we
should just...

12:12.975 --> 12:14.243
Maybe we should what babe?

12:14.311 --> 12:15.744
Take him to hospital?

12:15.812 --> 12:18.447
We do that we do more
time than he will.

12:18.515 --> 12:23.651
He's the bad guy,
not us, okay.

12:23.719 --> 12:25.052
Hey you go help your partner.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.828
Edward Winters,
financial crimes.

12:33.895 --> 12:36.063
Arrested him 8 months ago
for investment fraud.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.366
He got 12 years; that's
pretty heavy for white collar.

12:38.434 --> 12:41.201
Yeah, the guy's a
gazillionaire... he opted

12:41.269 --> 12:44.037
for the jury trial not
the smartest move in the

12:44.105 --> 12:45.305
middle of a recession.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.506
So what happened
to the money?

12:46.574 --> 12:47.341
It's gone.

12:47.342 --> 12:48.809
Gone?

12:48.810 --> 12:50.944
Yeah, according to
Winters he lost too.

12:51.011 --> 12:53.513
You believe that?
So where is it?

12:53.581 --> 12:54.781
Who knows?

12:54.849 --> 12:56.983
Checked the mattress,
can't find it.

12:57.051 --> 12:59.185
I'm guessing it's
getting a tan.

12:59.253 --> 13:01.054
And everyone who
invested lost.

13:01.122 --> 13:03.356
Well the ones that got in first
got great results as promised.

13:03.357 --> 13:05.925
Everyone else, you know,
got three percent on the dollar

13:05.926 --> 13:08.294
plus the satisfaction
of seeing him convicted.

13:08.362 --> 13:10.263
So why is he out?

13:10.330 --> 13:13.365
He got twelve years, he
appealed, someone listened...

13:13.432 --> 13:14.867
today's a big
day though...

13:14.934 --> 13:16.368
Yeah, why's that?

13:16.435 --> 13:18.904
Well the result of the
appeal comes in tomorrow.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.305
Word is its not
looking good.

13:20.373 --> 13:21.907
Who posted his bail?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.742
Probably some
bail bondsman.

13:23.810 --> 13:25.177
Check the public record.

13:25.245 --> 13:26.511
I was hoping you could
save me the keystroke.

13:26.579 --> 13:28.045
Some people aren't too
happy that he's out on

13:28.113 --> 13:29.513
bail awaiting an appeal.

13:29.581 --> 13:31.015
They put a bullet in him.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.583
No a big surprise.

13:32.651 --> 13:36.154
Ponzi schemes prey on the
people with the most to lose.

13:36.221 --> 13:39.157
<i>[siren]</i>

13:44.662 --> 13:45.996
Can I clean that up?

13:46.063 --> 13:47.563
Once that blood seeps
into the wood it...

13:47.631 --> 13:50.533
You guys have
everything you need?

13:50.601 --> 13:52.502
Just wait till we clear
out of her if that's okay.

13:52.569 --> 13:53.870
Thank you, I have a new

13:53.938 --> 13:55.839
tenant moving in the
day after tomorrow.

13:55.907 --> 13:57.740
Who came in and stole
all the furniture?

13:57.809 --> 13:59.475
That got repo'd by the feds,
except what you see here;

13:59.543 --> 14:00.876
not really
worth anything.

14:00.944 --> 14:02.411
Hey what can you tell
me about Ted Winters?

14:02.478 --> 14:03.979
You heard about
the Ponzi scheme.

14:04.047 --> 14:05.447
Of course.

14:05.515 --> 14:06.748
The biggest one in Toronto
history, but hey I never

14:06.817 --> 14:08.083
had a problem with the
guy; always paid his rent

14:08.151 --> 14:10.052
on time, stayed here for
18 months until he...

14:10.120 --> 14:11.553
Until he went to jail.

14:11.621 --> 14:12.321
He phoned me this morning

14:12.388 --> 14:13.455
and told me he didn't need
the office anymore.

14:13.523 --> 14:14.589
You still have
that number?

14:14.657 --> 14:16.291
Yeah.

14:16.358 --> 14:17.826
Personal finance manager.

14:17.893 --> 14:19.694
You know he took people's
money and promised them more.

14:19.761 --> 14:21.196
There is only one way to
make money in this world

14:21.263 --> 14:22.931
my friend; real estate.

14:22.998 --> 14:24.432
Yeah, good stuff.

14:24.499 --> 14:26.100
Listen, a lot of people
are obviously pretty upset

14:26.168 --> 14:28.303
at the way Ted Winters
took their money.

14:28.370 --> 14:29.304
Have you had any trouble
here, you know, arguments,

14:29.371 --> 14:30.305
that sort of thing?

14:30.372 --> 14:32.772
Not here,
Courts, for sure.

14:32.841 --> 14:34.174
Surveillance got anything?

14:34.242 --> 14:36.376
No cameras.

14:36.444 --> 14:37.744
Why have I needed
them before now?

14:37.812 --> 14:39.012
Whole world is on candid
camera now brother;

14:39.080 --> 14:41.281
you might want to
look into it. Nothing?

14:41.349 --> 14:43.250
Pulled the tapes from
underground lot, saw some

14:43.318 --> 14:44.584
images but they're
grainy as hell.

14:44.652 --> 14:45.618
Awesome.

15:33.564 --> 15:36.165
I'm going to need
some help here.

15:36.233 --> 15:37.733
Not from him;
he stays where he is.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.802
Not from him; I need someone
to talk me through this.

15:39.870 --> 15:42.405
Nobody's coming
here, no, no, no one.

15:42.472 --> 15:43.806
I have a friend....she's a
surgeon; she can talk me

15:43.874 --> 15:45.608
through it on the phone.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.176
No.

15:47.244 --> 15:48.477
That's our best shot at
doing this right and after

15:48.545 --> 15:49.112
that you can do whatever
you want wit this guy;

15:49.179 --> 15:50.746
I don't care.

15:50.814 --> 15:53.515
<i>[esp]: Ask to use their phone,</i>
<i>they can trace the call.</i>

15:53.582 --> 15:57.652
Turn your GPS off on your
phone, I can use that.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.754
No. No phones,
it's too risky.

15:59.822 --> 16:01.156
Okay.

16:01.224 --> 16:02.457
I'm going to use the radio
in the ambulance;

16:02.525 --> 16:03.591
they can't trace that.

16:03.659 --> 16:04.893
- Good idea.
- It's a good idea.

16:04.961 --> 16:06.929
It's a good idea.
I'm not an idiot.

16:06.996 --> 16:10.864
[♪]

16:12.133 --> 16:13.401
What do they want?

16:13.468 --> 16:14.735
<i>They haven't</i>
<i>made any demands.</i>

16:14.803 --> 16:16.003
Then what?

16:16.071 --> 16:17.471
Look Winters, the
guy they kidnapped,

16:17.539 --> 16:18.906
he's in pretty bad shape.

16:18.974 --> 16:20.607
Olivia's about to walk
them through surgery.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.910
<i>That gives me two hours to</i>
<i>find that damn ambulance.</i>

16:22.978 --> 16:24.911
Can she stretch it out?

16:24.979 --> 16:28.281
Can't do that; it would be
putting the man's live at risk.

16:28.349 --> 16:30.216
Toby and Oz are
already at risk.

16:30.284 --> 16:32.352
You don't think
I know that?

16:34.888 --> 16:36.256
Hey any luck?

16:36.324 --> 16:38.624
I've narrowed it down to
six people named James.

16:38.692 --> 16:40.192
Any suspects from there?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.460
I'm trying to get a
voice match here;

16:41.527 --> 16:42.594
do you think you
can take over?

16:42.662 --> 16:43.728
Yeah.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.064
Let me know if
you get anything.

16:45.131 --> 16:46.165
Where's Klein?

16:46.232 --> 16:47.466
He's in court
this afternoon.

16:47.533 --> 16:49.601
Any news on the ambulance?

16:49.669 --> 16:50.602
No nothing yet.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.171

Hey Liv.

17:02.014 --> 17:03.348
Hey Toby...

17:03.415 --> 17:06.483
Hey Liv, uh, it's good
to hear your voice.

17:06.550 --> 17:07.685
The two of you okay?

17:07.752 --> 17:10.788
Yeah, never better.

17:10.856 --> 17:12.755
That's great; I'm missing
dinner for the two of you.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.290
All right let's
get on with this.

17:14.358 --> 17:15.657
<i>What are we dealing with?</i>

17:15.726 --> 17:17.361
We have a GSW to the
left sartoriuous...

17:17.428 --> 17:19.695
No, no, no medical jargon
I want to know what's going on.

17:19.762 --> 17:21.698
You try that again...

17:21.765 --> 17:24.701
Liv, we have a gunshot
wound to the upper left leg.

17:24.768 --> 17:26.803
Without an X-ray to
specify that the bullet is

17:26.871 --> 17:28.937
of no immediate concern
its safer to just clean

17:29.006 --> 17:30.739
the wound and leave
it in the body.

17:30.807 --> 17:32.841
A hot bullet is
self-sterilizing.

17:32.909 --> 17:36.745
No, look, I know that he's
bleeding quite a bit here Liv.

17:36.813 --> 17:39.715
What's the S & D
on his BP?

17:39.782 --> 17:42.885
Liv, can you do that in
plain English from now on;

17:42.952 --> 17:45.153
everyone here wants to
know what's going on.

17:45.221 --> 17:46.354
I'll try my best.

17:46.422 --> 17:47.722
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

17:47.789 --> 17:49.757
<i>His blood pressure is</i>
<i>90/50.</i>

17:49.825 --> 17:51.292
How much morphine?

17:51.360 --> 17:53.128
We've had him maxed at ten
since we picked him up.

17:53.195 --> 17:56.498
Without an X-ray or MRI we have
no idea what we're heading into.

17:56.565 --> 17:59.100
This guy has got to live.

18:00.168 --> 18:02.269
Toby?

18:02.370 --> 18:04.671
Toby are you there?

18:04.739 --> 18:07.841
Yeah, Liv, uh, look
there's going to be no MRI;

18:07.909 --> 18:09.309
we need to
do something.

18:09.377 --> 18:10.944
They guy's been bleeding
for over three hours now.

18:11.012 --> 18:14.348
Okay you're going to have to find
the wound and try to stitch it up.

18:14.416 --> 18:15.982
Yeah, okay.

18:16.050 --> 18:17.816
Can you walk me
through that?

18:17.884 --> 18:19.852
I'm going to need you
make an incision a little

18:19.920 --> 18:22.721
above the ligament and
then extend it downward

18:22.789 --> 18:25.925
about two inches, okay?

18:25.992 --> 18:27.826
You can do this Toby.

18:27.894 --> 18:31.797
[♪]

18:31.865 --> 18:33.665
Wish me luck.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.701
Hey, I found our most
likely suspects.

18:36.769 --> 18:37.969
It's James and
Clare Madison.

18:38.037 --> 18:39.304
Voice prints were
a close match.

18:39.372 --> 18:40.539
I sent Metro over
to their place.

18:40.606 --> 18:41.606
Let me guess, they
weren't there.

18:41.674 --> 18:42.974
Bingo.

18:43.042 --> 18:44.376
And I got their victim
impact statements.

18:44.444 --> 18:45.743
Let's have a look.

18:45.811 --> 18:50.647
[♪]

18:50.715 --> 18:52.716
All right Liv,
got it open here.

18:52.784 --> 18:55.286
<i>What have you got?</i>

18:55.353 --> 18:56.920
Looks like the bullet is
lodged against the

18:56.988 --> 18:59.156
fermoral artery right at the tear.

18:59.224 --> 19:00.791
This could pose a
situation of massive

19:00.858 --> 19:03.561
hypoglemia or even a
possible exsanguination.

19:03.628 --> 19:04.994
What the hell
does that mean?

19:05.062 --> 19:06.528
It means if I pull the
bullet out it's either

19:06.529 --> 19:07.630
going to save
him or kill him.

19:13.146 --> 19:14.914
So tell me
about the Madisons.

19:14.948 --> 19:17.950
James and Clare Madison,
they've been married for six years.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.785
James works at a shipping
place on the Queensway.

19:19.853 --> 19:23.789
Clare was a dial-a-maid.
She used to clean Winters' house.

19:23.890 --> 19:29.227
Here is James and Clare Madison's
victim impact statements

19:29.295 --> 19:33.731
There were four of
us, two couples,

19:33.799 --> 19:35.366
pooled our money together.

19:35.434 --> 19:38.102
He said he needed
the $250,000 buy-in.

19:38.170 --> 19:40.004
He later let us
in for $150,000.

19:40.072 --> 19:41.572
We thought we were lucky.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.708
We leveraged
everything to get in.

19:43.775 --> 19:45.943
We got in just before the
thing went off the rails;

19:46.010 --> 19:48.345
we lost everything.

19:48.412 --> 19:49.779
We have a voice match?

19:49.848 --> 19:51.915
Nothing that will hold up
in court but it's them.

19:51.983 --> 19:55.319
The real bastard in all
this is Ted Winters.

19:55.386 --> 19:56.887
Ted Winters.

19:56.955 --> 19:59.989
You know that; so we lose
all our money right,

20:00.057 --> 20:03.726
where's the
justice in that?

20:03.793 --> 20:05.027
This guy deserves
more than jail,

20:05.095 --> 20:06.229
let me tell you that much.

20:06.296 --> 20:07.930
Deserves worse;
what, like a bullet?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.765
Like that guy can bend
spoons with his hatred.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.000
They went in with
another couple?

20:11.068 --> 20:12.068
Yeah.

20:12.069 --> 20:13.202
Let's find out who they
are, see if they're in on it.

20:13.270 --> 20:14.536
Okay, I'm on it.

20:18.341 --> 20:20.208
The tourniquet's on,
circulation is under control.

20:20.276 --> 20:22.177
<i>What's next?</i>

20:22.245 --> 20:23.845
Sgt. McCluskey's got a lead.

20:25.147 --> 20:26.447
I need one of you
to clamp the artery

20:26.515 --> 20:28.283
before you remove the bullet.

20:28.351 --> 20:30.651
<i>As soon as it's out</i>
<i>you need to stitch.</i>

20:30.719 --> 20:33.053
All right look, you gotta let
my partner go I need him.

20:33.121 --> 20:34.121
No way.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.189
Just untie him
alright.

20:35.257 --> 20:36.290
It's not happening.

20:36.358 --> 20:37.657
Look its him or you?

20:37.725 --> 20:39.193
We never said anything
about killing him.

20:39.261 --> 20:41.461
Jim please,
please, let him go.

20:42.530 --> 20:43.697
All right, untie him.

20:43.765 --> 20:44.731
You don't do anything
stupid right.

20:50.104 --> 20:51.704
<i>Hey Liv it's Oz, just</i>
<i>putting on gloves here.</i>

20:51.772 --> 20:56.976
[♪]

20:57.044 --> 20:59.178
Clamping.

20:59.246 --> 21:01.580
<i>Clamped Liv, what's next?</i>

21:01.648 --> 21:02.848
You ready to go for
the bullet Toby...

21:02.917 --> 21:04.582
<i>Yeah we are.</i>

21:04.650 --> 21:06.285
Okay as soon as it's
out stitch it up.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.353
Are you looking at a
lot of blood there?

21:08.421 --> 21:10.555
<i>No, no, it could be worse.</i>

21:10.623 --> 21:12.057
Now's as good
a time as any.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.126
<i>All right, going in.</i>

21:14.193 --> 21:18.964
[♪]

21:19.032 --> 21:20.531
Bullet's out.

21:20.598 --> 21:21.899
Artery damage?

21:21.967 --> 21:24.001
Tiny, about 2 mm.

21:24.069 --> 21:26.503
Good, that's good, a
couple of stitches will do.

21:26.571 --> 21:27.972
All right, what
happens next?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.574
As soon as Toby's done he
can stitch and finish.

21:30.642 --> 21:34.946
[♪]

21:35.013 --> 21:36.546
You heard her;
do what she said.

21:36.613 --> 21:37.780
Toby?

21:37.848 --> 21:39.282
Hello?

21:39.350 --> 21:40.716
Toby?

21:40.784 --> 21:43.019
They're gone.

21:43.087 --> 21:45.288
Sgt. McCluskey,
we lost contact.

21:45.356 --> 21:46.990
I understand you must be
frustrated Mr. Ryder.

21:47.058 --> 21:49.426
Right now we're following
every lead we can.

21:49.493 --> 21:50.961
Are we any closer?

21:51.028 --> 21:54.529
Yes, I will call you the
minute I have any information.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.767
Mr. and Mrs. Everton,
I really appreciate you

21:58.835 --> 22:01.503
taking the time to talk
about the Madisons.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.506
Anything you can tell me
at all would be a great help.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.309
Well we don't talk to James
and Clare anymore, so...

22:07.377 --> 22:08.609
Anything.

22:08.677 --> 22:10.945
Last week James
called out of the blue...

22:11.013 --> 22:12.280
And what did he want?

22:12.348 --> 22:14.082
He'd been reading the
chat rooms.

22:14.149 --> 22:15.950
There's one for the
victims, said that Winters

22:16.018 --> 22:17.218
got out on appeal.

22:17.286 --> 22:18.719
He was livid.

22:18.787 --> 22:21.155
I told him to go for a
jog, go lift some weights,

22:21.223 --> 22:23.391
there wasn't anything we
could do about anymore.

22:23.459 --> 22:26.093
None of us could afford to
lose the money we lost.

22:26.160 --> 22:30.230
Winters fleeced us, so if
he's in danger don't ask

22:30.298 --> 22:32.932
me to feel bad for him.

22:33.001 --> 22:34.801
Well thank you
for your time.

22:34.869 --> 22:37.937
Sure, I'll call if
I hear anything.

22:38.006 --> 22:39.473
Okay, thank you.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here

22:50.384 --> 22:51.817
Hey... so what do you have?

22:51.885 --> 22:54.586
Wes Everton owner of a
small shipping company,

22:54.654 --> 22:56.187
they foreclosed
two weeks ago.

22:56.255 --> 22:57.422
And?

22:57.490 --> 22:59.090
And James Madison
used to work there.

22:59.158 --> 23:01.626
Not a bad place to
hide an ambulance.

23:01.693 --> 23:02.994
That's a pretty big if...

23:03.062 --> 23:04.795
Let's check it out.

23:06.499 --> 23:08.933
All right, that should be
all he needs right now.

23:09.001 --> 23:12.136
What he needs is to get
up and get out of here.

23:12.203 --> 23:14.505
He just had surgery; he's
going to need some time.

23:14.572 --> 23:17.841
James. His blood pressure is
dangerously low; he needs

23:17.909 --> 23:19.276
to rest right now.

23:19.344 --> 23:20.777
He doesn't have
time to rest okay.

23:20.845 --> 23:22.346
The cops are going to
be here any minute.

23:22.414 --> 23:23.847
They're not going to have
trouble finding this place.

23:23.915 --> 23:25.282
We're wasting time.

23:25.350 --> 23:26.750
Hey, hey...

23:26.817 --> 23:28.751
Come on man, just go easy
on him, he has to recover.

23:28.818 --> 23:30.219
Let me tell you something.

23:30.287 --> 23:33.423
He goes back in ... when he
goes back in we lose our

23:33.490 --> 23:35.824
chance to get everything we're
owed; do you understand me?

23:35.892 --> 23:38.761
Ted Please, please just
tell us where the money is?

23:38.828 --> 23:39.929
Look at me;
where's the money?

23:39.996 --> 23:40.963
Come on back off man.

23:41.031 --> 23:42.098
There isn't any money.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.132
Back off from him.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.534
Relax...

23:44.601 --> 23:45.534
There is money Ted; the
courts didn't get it.

23:45.602 --> 23:47.603
Where is it?

23:47.671 --> 23:49.071
No money...

23:49.138 --> 23:56.178
[♪]

23:56.245 --> 23:58.714
No money? You think
we're stupid Ted?

23:58.782 --> 24:00.315
I was at the auction.

24:00.383 --> 24:03.417
You had eight Rolexes at
that auction Ted... eight!

24:03.485 --> 24:05.386
Hey, hey, look at me,
look at me.

24:05.454 --> 24:07.055
- Do the right thing.
- Blood pressure is dropping.

24:07.063 --> 24:08.556
Just give people
their money back.

24:08.624 --> 24:09.557
James, take it easy.

24:09.625 --> 24:12.961
Stop... stop.

24:13.028 --> 24:15.096
Okay.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.497
Come on...

24:16.565 --> 24:18.398
You've ruined a lot of
people's lives, okay.

24:18.466 --> 24:19.766
Give us the money back.

24:19.834 --> 24:24.537
Listen to me. I need
enough to get away.

24:24.606 --> 24:28.809
You help me, you'll
get your money.

24:28.876 --> 24:30.978
I knew it. I knew it.

24:31.045 --> 24:32.112
I told you, I knew
you had the money.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.512
Where's the money?
Where is it?

24:33.580 --> 24:34.780
James!

24:34.848 --> 24:35.982
Where's the money...

24:36.049 --> 24:39.785
I know where it is
okay; he told me.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.787
When?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.388
When we were in the ambulance
he told me where it is;

24:43.456 --> 24:45.257
I know where the
money is.

24:48.794 --> 24:51.295
Back out of the
way... come on.

24:52.698 --> 24:54.232
Alright. There's no pulse,
he's in arrest.

24:54.299 --> 24:56.001
His heart has
stopped beating.

24:56.068 --> 24:57.368
I'm going to start
compressions.

24:57.436 --> 24:58.703
Okay, you got the pads?

24:58.771 --> 25:00.204
Yeah.

25:04.076 --> 25:06.511
Come on man; should have
been in the hospital.

25:06.578 --> 25:07.512

Oh god no, no, no, no.

This is on you man.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.517
She's on you.

25:48.585 --> 25:50.386
He's dead, man. This is
your responsibility,

25:50.453 --> 25:51.387
this is your fault!

25:51.454 --> 25:53.721
Shut up.

25:55.791 --> 26:00.028
Good people huh? Good people
who rob pockets of a dead man?

26:01.096 --> 26:02.530
What is that?

26:02.598 --> 26:04.165
A key.

26:04.233 --> 26:05.700
All right, now we're going
to find out if you were

26:05.767 --> 26:07.502
telling the truth about
knowing where the money is.

Is that Winters?

Is he alive?

27:01.439 --> 27:03.407
The blood results should
be in soon.

27:03.474 --> 27:06.043
Not fast enough.

27:06.110 --> 27:08.278
Look don't worry; I'm sure
it's just Winters' blood.

27:08.346 --> 27:09.279
Yeah.

27:09.347 --> 27:11.014
[phone ringing]

27:11.082 --> 27:12.782
Hello?

27:12.850 --> 27:15.584
Yes, yeah, I'm on
the scene right now.

27:20.991 --> 27:22.391
It's not one of
my boys is it?

27:22.459 --> 27:24.093
It's Winters.

27:24.161 --> 27:25.394
It's what?

27:25.462 --> 27:26.695
I don't understand,
Winters was fine,

27:26.763 --> 27:28.331
we got him
through surgery.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.932
The defibrilator is out; it looks
like he went into cardiac arrest.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.268
The Coroner
hasn't ruled yet.

27:33.336 --> 27:35.437
They're isolating the
blood samples to make sure

27:35.504 --> 27:37.572
that it's just Winters.

27:37.639 --> 27:39.975
This wasn't a case where Toby
was working for you was it?

27:40.042 --> 27:41.809
No.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.578
Look we're doing
everything we can to get

27:43.645 --> 27:46.813
them back and I promise
you Mr. Ryder, we will.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.794
We shouldn't have
left his body.

28:00.862 --> 28:03.396
What kind of
people do that?

28:03.464 --> 28:05.398
Hey, you gonna let us go?

28:05.466 --> 28:07.933
Yeah, if you're not lying.

28:08.002 --> 28:09.635
Here's what's
going to happen.

28:09.703 --> 28:11.137
You're going to go in
there with Clare,

28:11.205 --> 28:13.239
I'm going to keep a gun on
your body for collateral.

28:13.307 --> 28:16.109
Anything hinky happens
she's going to call me;

28:16.176 --> 28:19.478
I'm going to put a
bullet in your pal.

28:19.545 --> 28:21.813
And when we find the
money we bring it back.

28:21.881 --> 28:24.216
Then we tie you up
and we call it in.

28:24.283 --> 28:25.917
That was before James.

28:25.985 --> 28:26.985
We can't just call it in.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.553
We're murderers.

28:28.621 --> 28:30.322
No, no, he died.

28:30.390 --> 28:31.656
I did not kill him.

28:31.724 --> 28:32.957
Believe what you want.

28:33.026 --> 28:33.992
I didn't kill him!

28:34.059 --> 28:35.826
He's dead James!

28:35.894 --> 28:36.927
We went in to get the
money; we went in to do

28:36.995 --> 28:38.129
the right thing.

28:38.196 --> 28:40.398
And then he
pulled a gun baby.

28:40.465 --> 28:43.000
<i>[esp]: There's no</i>
<i>money left....</i>

28:43.068 --> 28:44.101
<i>where's the</i>
<i>goddamn money....</i>

28:44.169 --> 28:45.236
<i>[gunshot]</i>

28:45.303 --> 28:47.405
<i>We have</i>
<i>to call 911.</i>

28:48.407 --> 28:50.140
Baby that was his gun.

28:50.207 --> 28:52.442
If he didn't pull it,
it wouldn't have gone off.

28:52.510 --> 28:53.676
That is self defense.

28:53.744 --> 28:55.045
You hear me?

28:55.112 --> 28:56.879
That is self defense;
we are not murderers so you

28:56.947 --> 28:58.114
go in there with the
paramedic, you get that

28:58.182 --> 29:01.551
money we can still
make this right.

29:01.618 --> 29:06.588
[♪]

29:11.261 --> 29:13.495
Damn it!

29:13.563 --> 29:17.433
Hey, they're okay;
I'm sure they are.

29:18.201 --> 29:19.368
It sounded like the
operation was going just

29:19.436 --> 29:21.370
fine; why haven't
they been let go yet?

29:21.438 --> 29:23.137
You know, for all we know
Toby and Oz could be stuck

29:23.205 --> 29:25.073
on the side of a
road somewhere.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.408
They were responding
to a broken ankle call;

29:27.476 --> 29:29.210
routine call on a sleepy
Sunday morning.

29:29.278 --> 29:31.579
It's not like they were running
into a burning building.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.647
I worked with a woman a
couple of years back,

29:33.715 --> 29:36.417
she just checked into emerg
for her shifts and some

29:36.485 --> 29:38.918
crack head takes
a knife to her.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.520
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

29:40.588 --> 29:42.122
I'm just saying, you make
saving lives your business

29:42.190 --> 29:46.059
at some point you're
going to risk your own.

29:46.127 --> 29:47.927
It's going to be fine.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.830
They're smart guys,
they'll get through this.

29:50.898 --> 29:52.765
I just don't know about
the people they're with.

29:52.833 --> 29:57.903
Hey... whoever took them
has no idea what they're up against.

29:57.971 --> 30:11.516
[♪]

30:11.517 --> 30:23.094
[♪]

30:24.597 --> 30:27.297
All the goods here are
being held in escrow.

30:27.365 --> 30:28.865
Here, take a look at this.

30:28.933 --> 30:30.334
The van's unaccounted for;
there's a good chance that

30:30.401 --> 30:31.468
it was the
get-away vehicle.

30:31.536 --> 30:33.403
Okay let's get
this to Metro.

30:33.471 --> 30:34.871
Who were Winters' friends.

30:34.939 --> 30:36.240
What are you thinking?

30:36.307 --> 30:37.641
Maybe the bail bondsman
didn't post his bail.

30:37.708 --> 30:40.043
Who was listed
as the surety.

30:41.212 --> 30:44.980
Our records show the bail was
posted by an Alexis Moores.

30:45.048 --> 30:47.716
Any connection to Winters?

30:47.784 --> 30:49.785
No connection to Winters
but she worked here as a

30:49.853 --> 30:53.856
receptionist at Everton Express
along with James.

30:53.923 --> 30:55.424
She's not on the
victim's roster.

30:55.492 --> 30:57.293
Well she wouldn't be able
to post his bail if she was.

30:57.361 --> 30:59.694
Maybe James and his wife knew
that, had her front for them.

30:59.762 --> 31:01.696
Why would the
spring Winters?

31:01.764 --> 31:04.132
Well ten grand is worth it
if they're able to collect millions.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.067
Why kill him?

31:06.135 --> 31:08.203
I don't know; maybe
it was an accident.

31:08.271 --> 31:09.904
What about Toby and Oz?

31:09.972 --> 31:11.939
They needed them
to keep him alive.

31:12.007 --> 31:14.308
Now that he's dead?

31:14.376 --> 31:16.743
[sigh] I don't know.

31:22.150 --> 31:30.956
[♪]

31:31.024 --> 31:32.725
You know you guys are in
deeper than you think.

31:32.793 --> 31:34.026
Now we are, yeah.

31:34.094 --> 31:35.761
We just wanted to get
our money back;

31:35.829 --> 31:37.397
everybody's money back.

31:37.464 --> 31:40.066
So why did James
bring the gun?

31:40.133 --> 31:41.100
He didn't.

31:41.168 --> 31:42.669
Yeah, you sure?

31:42.736 --> 31:44.070
I mean Winters
is out on appeal.

31:44.137 --> 31:46.172
How easy would it be
for him to get a gun?

31:46.239 --> 31:47.406
It was in his office.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.274
Police would
have found it.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.142
I've been watching James
handle that gun;

31:51.211 --> 31:53.178
I think he brought it.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.087
You know I've never been
good with money either.

32:03.154 --> 32:05.789
Obviously I didn't want
it to go down like this.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.191
Obviously.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.659
You know I would have left
you guys back there,

32:08.727 --> 32:10.361
I just didn't want to run
the risk of you calling it

32:10.429 --> 32:13.698
in before we got our
money, that's all.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.899
Yeah well you don't want
to do anything stupid.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.535
Yeah, okay,
that's very funny.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.169
No.

32:20.238 --> 32:22.405
You think
I wanted this?

32:26.877 --> 32:29.078
Okay, all right,
you stay there.

32:29.146 --> 32:34.850
[♪]

32:34.917 --> 32:39.388
This is it; this is our
chance to make things right.

32:46.062 --> 32:48.464
Ahh, come on.

32:50.266 --> 32:53.801
Money's not in here!

32:53.869 --> 32:56.337
Winters is dead and the
money's not in here.

32:56.405 --> 32:57.572
It's over.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.574
Of course he wouldn't
have the money here;

32:59.642 --> 33:02.076
God, we're so naive you
know, thinking that we could

33:02.144 --> 33:05.079
just Robin Hood our way
in and save the day.

33:05.147 --> 33:06.980
So are we free
to go or...?

33:07.047 --> 33:08.315
No.

33:08.383 --> 33:09.983
God what are
we going to do?

33:10.050 --> 33:12.619
Let us go; we'll give you that
head start we talked about.

33:21.496 --> 33:23.462
James, give me the gun.

33:23.530 --> 33:24.630
Put your hands out.

33:24.698 --> 33:36.074
[♪]

33:36.142 --> 33:40.912
Oh my God. Diamonds!

33:40.979 --> 33:44.248
They got to be worth at
least half a million.

33:44.317 --> 33:45.883
It's enough.

33:45.951 --> 33:48.485
Think about it James; think
about what we can do with it.

33:48.553 --> 33:50.521
We can do the right thing.

33:50.588 --> 33:55.626
He had the money,
he had the money.

33:55.694 --> 33:58.529
What was he going to do?

33:59.298 --> 34:02.498
[esp]: Toby this isn't good.

34:02.566 --> 34:04.801
You take the cell
phone, give it to me.

34:04.869 --> 34:06.169
Okay.

34:06.237 --> 34:12.507
[♪]

34:12.576 --> 34:15.078
I'm going to check
his messages.

34:15.146 --> 34:17.280
Text messages
from some number.

34:17.348 --> 34:18.880
The guy had an airplane
waiting for him.

34:18.949 --> 34:20.349
This is good.

34:20.416 --> 34:21.817
This is good?

34:21.885 --> 34:23.319
We're going to do what he
was going to do, we're

34:23.386 --> 34:24.954
going to take that plane.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.290
We got to; we have to
take that plane, babe.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.726
All that talk about the
future, about family?

34:31.793 --> 34:35.163
If we stop now we
lose all of that.

34:35.231 --> 34:36.764
Winters had a plan...

34:36.831 --> 34:38.867
He had a plan.

34:38.934 --> 34:40.534
All I have to do is text
whoever is on the end of

34:40.601 --> 34:43.536
this line and we got a
shot at a new life;

34:43.605 --> 34:45.373
we got to take it.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.908
You're right,
you're right.

34:46.976 --> 34:51.344
You text him back for
Ted Winters, you're on your way.

34:52.179 --> 34:53.981
I love you.

34:55.449 --> 34:56.616
If you love her so much
you guys should give

34:56.684 --> 34:58.252
yourselves up.

34:58.319 --> 35:00.120
You guys are just piling one
mistake onto another here.

35:00.188 --> 35:01.654
Shut up!

35:01.722 --> 35:03.757
Stop talking.

35:03.824 --> 35:05.158
You, you drive.

35:05.226 --> 35:07.326
[♪]

35:11.877 --> 35:13.310
We're not
going to kill you...

35:13.378 --> 35:14.912
Yeah, like you weren't
going to kill that guy.

35:14.980 --> 35:17.949
All right, look; we get
there you let my partner go,

35:18.016 --> 35:21.018
you take me. I don't care.

35:21.086 --> 35:24.688
<i>[esp]: There's no way I'm</i>
<i>leaving you with these guys.</i>

35:24.757 --> 35:26.090
Now we're not letting
either of you go,

35:26.158 --> 35:27.324
not until we're safe.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.659
We can't.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.798
Hey, so what do you have?

35:34.866 --> 35:36.967
Forensics found Winters' jacket
in the back of the ambulance.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.236
Found his passport
in the lining.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.904
That's good work.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.939
Looks like he still had enough
scratch to pay for the best.

35:43.007 --> 35:46.142
This proves he wasn't going
to show up for his appeal.

35:46.209 --> 35:47.176
Did we contact
the borders?

35:47.244 --> 35:48.911
I already did.

35:48.979 --> 35:50.279
You're moving to the
head of the class.

35:50.346 --> 35:52.547
Got this ticket.

35:52.615 --> 35:54.183
Albany airport.

35:54.251 --> 35:55.651
He was going to take a
connector from there to Belize.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.519
Puddle jump to any
safe haven he wants.

35:57.587 --> 36:01.189
Yeah, check out Bishop's
Road and RR 27.

36:02.124 --> 36:04.793
It's Green River; looks like
there's an airfield there.

36:04.860 --> 36:05.860
Let's go.

36:05.928 --> 36:07.095
Thanks.

36:07.163 --> 36:17.437
[♪]

36:17.438 --> 36:24.978
[♪]

36:26.547 --> 36:29.516
There... okay baby, where
do you want to go?

36:29.583 --> 36:33.252
I don't know; wherever
Winters was...

36:33.320 --> 36:34.622
Hello?

36:38.451 --> 36:40.718
Wes?

36:40.786 --> 36:43.888
You have.. you,
you can't be here.

36:43.956 --> 36:46.090
Those texts were from you?

36:46.158 --> 36:48.192
You bastard; you were going
to fly him out of here?

36:48.260 --> 36:51.662
Yeah, yeah we were, to get
the money back we lost

36:51.729 --> 36:53.730
listening to you.

36:53.798 --> 36:56.066
So you were going to
betray your friends?

36:56.133 --> 36:59.002
And I suppose you kidnapped
Winters to help us?

36:59.070 --> 37:00.704
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

37:00.772 --> 37:03.607
Eva, I swear we were just trying
to get all of the money back.

37:03.675 --> 37:05.040
Yours too.

37:05.108 --> 37:07.477
How did that
work out for you?

37:07.544 --> 37:09.144
The police came by;
they were asking about you.

37:09.212 --> 37:10.446
So where's Winters now?

37:10.514 --> 37:13.483
He got what he deserved.

37:13.550 --> 37:14.984
What the hell happened?

37:15.051 --> 37:16.051
He's dead.

37:16.119 --> 37:17.920
It was just an accident.

37:17.988 --> 37:19.589
We just wanted everybody
to get their money back.

37:19.656 --> 37:21.089
Let's go; we got
to get out of here.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.691
Oh no, no, you're not
going anywhere without us.

37:22.758 --> 37:23.758
You're going to
fly us out of here.

37:23.826 --> 37:25.193
No, no, no way.

37:25.260 --> 37:28.162
Yes you are if you want
your share of the money.

37:28.230 --> 37:30.632
What the hell's
he talking about?

37:30.700 --> 37:33.067
Tell me!

37:33.135 --> 37:36.537
James, show them.

37:38.773 --> 37:40.140
How much is that?

37:40.208 --> 37:42.342
It's enough so we can
get back on our feet.

37:42.410 --> 37:45.713
<i>[esp]: They're not paying</i>
<i>attention to us...</i>

37:45.780 --> 37:47.882
Come on man, you just fly
us out of here like you

37:47.949 --> 37:49.383
were going to
do for Winters.

37:49.450 --> 37:50.651
I think you were going to
keep it all; I don't think

37:50.719 --> 37:52.919
you planned on sharing
that with anybody.

37:52.987 --> 37:54.654
Well Eva it doesn't matter
now does it because

37:54.722 --> 37:56.022
I'm going to split
it with you okay.

37:56.089 --> 37:57.657
Let's get out of here.

37:57.725 --> 37:59.091
What about you?

37:59.159 --> 38:00.459
You were going to fly
this crook out of here.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.460
<i>[esp]: Here's our weak</i>
<i>link Toby.</i>

38:01.529 --> 38:02.896
We did what we had to do.

38:02.963 --> 38:04.130
<i>[esp]: She's barely aware</i>
<i>of the gun...</i>

38:04.197 --> 38:06.399
We just... we have
to stick together.

38:06.466 --> 38:08.300
This money is making us
all crazy but if we just

38:08.368 --> 38:11.803
fly out of here all of
problems will be over.

38:11.871 --> 38:13.839
[♪]

38:13.907 --> 38:15.240
Hey, huh, whoa...!

38:15.307 --> 38:16.307
Okay, guns on the other
foot, there you go.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.745
Okay, okay, okay.

38:19.812 --> 38:21.013
Oh boy.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.714
Okay...

38:23.850 --> 38:24.916
Okay.

38:24.983 --> 38:25.917
I got it.

38:25.984 --> 38:27.652
Okay, okay.

38:27.719 --> 38:30.788
James, get away from the plane;
you're not going anywhere.

38:30.856 --> 38:31.789
What are you going to do
kid, you can't shoot all

38:31.857 --> 38:32.957
four of us.

38:35.627 --> 38:36.694
[inaudible]

38:36.762 --> 38:38.095
Let's go.

38:38.163 --> 38:40.931
Get away from the plane.
Get away from the plane.

38:40.998 --> 38:42.398
You're going to
have to shoot me.

38:42.466 --> 38:45.635
I will... shoot you.

38:46.804 --> 38:48.271
Come on, shoot me!

38:48.338 --> 38:54.878
<i>[sirens]</i>

38:54.946 --> 38:57.713
I guess I don't
have to now.

38:57.781 --> 39:00.816
<i>[sirens]</i>

39:13.629 --> 39:16.397
For what it's worth I hope those
diamonds make it to Winters' victims.

39:16.465 --> 39:18.532
We'll the feds will make sure
they get where they need to go.

39:18.601 --> 39:20.835
I'm guessing it's
not to you two.

39:20.903 --> 39:22.570
He ruined us, okay;
we're victims.

39:22.638 --> 39:24.238
Yeah you were until
you kidnapped him.

39:24.306 --> 39:28.076
James be quiet; can't
blame anyone else anymore.

39:28.143 --> 39:36.416
[♪]

39:36.484 --> 39:37.517
Hey...

39:37.585 --> 39:38.652
Good to see you guys.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.087
Good to see you too sir.

39:40.154 --> 39:41.521
Oh you owe me
$18.50 by the way.

39:41.589 --> 39:42.522
For what?

39:42.590 --> 39:43.890
The pizza.

39:43.958 --> 39:44.925
No way; you didn't deliver it;

39:44.993 --> 39:46.359
have you ever heard of
30 minutes or it's free?

39:46.427 --> 39:47.360
I can't believe you're
trying to collect on that.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.728
I never agreed to that.

39:48.795 --> 39:50.896
- Sir I got shot at today.
- I don't care if you got shot.

39:50.964 --> 39:53.198
- You don't care that I got shot?
- Do I look like I care?

39:53.266 --> 39:54.333
So mean...

39:54.400 --> 39:55.467
Oh hey...

39:55.535 --> 39:56.836
How are you?

39:56.903 --> 39:58.437
Oh my goodness;
were you worried about me?

39:58.505 --> 39:59.639
I'm good.

39:59.706 --> 40:01.206
I was worried
about both of you.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.842
That's nice.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.276
Yeah, but one of us probably
more than the other right?

40:04.344 --> 40:06.979
Don't push it.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.914
Wow.

40:09.982 --> 40:10.949
Excuse me.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.050
Good work.

40:12.068 --> 40:13.318
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:13.386 --> 40:14.319
How you feeling?

40:14.387 --> 40:15.387
Glad you showed up;

40:15.455 --> 40:17.488
I don't know if I could have
pulled the trigger.

40:17.556 --> 40:19.157
How do you guys do that?

40:19.724 --> 40:22.861
You kept your cool.

40:22.928 --> 40:24.795
And you've done me
a few favors, I guess

40:24.796 --> 40:25.903
it's only fair I did you one now.
