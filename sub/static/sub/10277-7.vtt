WEBVTT

00:05.098 --> 00:06.198
Previously on E.R.

00:06.199 --> 00:08.611
What is this?
Why is she taking off her ankle wrap?

00:08.612 --> 00:09.812
You tricked me!

00:09.913 --> 00:14.562
How can I remember a William Blake poem
I memorized over 30 years ago...

00:15.615 --> 00:17.803
and not remember...

00:18.004 --> 00:20.706
that I saw a woman
with a sprained ankle this afternoon?

00:20.707 --> 00:23.227
No, I do work here
but only when they need me.

00:23.228 --> 00:26.461
I'm what they call a "moonlighter."

00:26.562 --> 00:29.619
I don't believe that we are
gonna be needing you anymore, Ok?

00:29.920 --> 00:31.155
Pills, some weed.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.061
What's this, Einstein, crank?

00:33.095 --> 00:34.665
How could you do this to me?!

00:34.666 --> 00:36.792
How could you do this to me?!

00:38.164 --> 00:41.271
6x07 "HUMPTY DUMPTY"

00:47.589 --> 00:50.625
Mark, what are you doing?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.842
Playing Tetris.

00:55.972 --> 00:59.755
- It's 5:30 in the morning.
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

00:59.975 --> 01:04.803
- Is this due to your father's arrival today?
- No, of course not.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.894
You'd feel worse if he
spent the holidays alone.

01:09.109 --> 01:13.023
What would Thanksgiving be
without turkey and guilt?

01:13.696 --> 01:16.269
I hope we can fake it getting along.

01:16.490 --> 01:19.574
I just hope he's comfortable
with our sleeping arrangements?

01:19.785 --> 01:23.319
Yeah, him and me in here
and you on the couch...

01:24.581 --> 01:25.826
Stop it!

01:26.750 --> 01:29.157
Peter! Peter, wake up!

01:30.128 --> 01:34.754
- How long was I asleep?
- How would I know? We need you now!

01:41.346 --> 01:42.425
Watch your back!

01:42.597 --> 01:45.088
- Rough night?
- We got slammed.

01:45.308 --> 01:49.306
- Trauma will get the juices flowing.
- Ready, lift.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.138
- What happened?
- Choir bus from Louisville hit by a semi.

01:53.316 --> 01:56.767
- Louisville?
- Came up for a gospel festival.

01:56.944 --> 02:01.107
This one may need surgery.
I'm assigning him to you.

02:01.323 --> 02:03.861
- Assigning him?
- I am the Triage officer.

02:04.075 --> 02:07.526
- Keep me informed.
- This is a nightmare.

02:07.745 --> 02:12.039
He wants more responsibility.
Tell me if you need help.

02:12.208 --> 02:16.668
The blood bank's low on O-neg.
Go easy. The bullet?

02:16.879 --> 02:20.544
Twenty-six year-old woman, neck pain,
midline tenderness.

02:20.757 --> 02:22.002
- Vitals?
- Stable.

02:22.217 --> 02:26.677
Leave her on the backboard
until I clear the x-ray.

02:26.888 --> 02:28.714
Whatever you say.

02:29.056 --> 02:31.843
- Where you going?
- Taking this lady for an ankle X-ray.

02:32.059 --> 02:36.804
She might not need it.
We don't want to tie up Radiology.

02:38.232 --> 02:40.769
- Take her to X-ray.
- Good idea.

02:41.193 --> 02:43.766
- So glad you could join us.
- Sorry-

02:43.987 --> 02:45.813
- We need you.
- Can I take my coat off?

02:45.989 --> 02:47.648
No, you cannot.

02:47.865 --> 02:50.403
- Talk to me.
- I'm on top of it.

02:50.618 --> 02:54.911
- Check the wrist pulses?
- No, I just thought I'd amputate.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.203
Neurocirc is fine.

02:57.457 --> 03:01.786
Get her something for her pain. Get her
to X-ray. Get busy in the suture room.

03:03.463 --> 03:06.001
- How we doing?
- Under control.

03:06.215 --> 03:08.789
Chest contusions.
I'll put her on a monitor.

03:09.010 --> 03:11.251
- What's the 12-lead show?
- She just came in.

03:11.428 --> 03:14.215
Right. I got a space in Exam Four.

03:14.431 --> 03:17.348
Can I attend the emergency
services committee meeting?

03:17.559 --> 03:20.310
- One step at a time.
- Excuse me.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.093
- I gotta go.
- Can you take this guy-

03:23.273 --> 03:25.598
- A patient can't breathe.
- You free?

03:26.234 --> 03:29.483
I have an allergic reaction.
I need sub-Q epi.

03:31.113 --> 03:34.114
If anybody needs me,
we'll be in the men's room.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.918 --> 04:32.661
- I got it.
- Thanks.

04:32.878 --> 04:34.787
Thanks for filling in at the desk.

04:35.005 --> 04:38.290
Sure. There's not much else
I can do except answer phones.

04:38.508 --> 04:42.885
Romano said to bring the Q/A data
to the Emergency Services meeting.

04:43.095 --> 04:47.971
When don't I? Elevate your feet
to reduce ankle swelling.

04:48.183 --> 04:51.219
Could you get Carol a stool,
so she can put her feet up, please?

04:51.436 --> 04:53.844
- Thank you.
- Anything else?

04:54.022 --> 04:58.849
Some milk would be great.
And I could use some pens.

04:59.068 --> 05:00.479
My pleasure.

05:02.363 --> 05:07.024
Thanks. Connie, could you
slide the phone over here?

05:07.701 --> 05:09.195
Great.

05:09.369 --> 05:12.204
- Guess I'm all set now.
- Morning.

05:12.372 --> 05:16.037
- You're back?
- Dr. Weaver called me in.

05:16.417 --> 05:20.746
- Don't you go south for the winter?
- Soon. Before the first snow.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.458
- You look great.
- Really?

05:23.632 --> 05:27.464
- Yep.
- I feel like an overgrown pumpkin.

05:27.636 --> 05:30.637
- Pumpkin?
- Orange, carved on Halloween.

05:30.847 --> 05:34.927
Oh, bundeva.
I'd say more like a lubenica.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.393
What is that?

05:38.145 --> 05:40.980
I forget how to say it in English.
See you.

05:46.069 --> 05:48.821
- He's oozing.
- Want the last unit of O-neg?

05:49.030 --> 05:52.446
- No, the bleeding's under control.
- Morning.

05:54.118 --> 05:58.198
- Lasering a liver lac?
- Using the argon to reduce blood loss.

05:58.414 --> 06:01.165
- Should I scrub in?
- No, I got it.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.700
But I need to ask a favor.

06:03.919 --> 06:06.042
- What's that?
- I need some time off.

06:06.254 --> 06:08.377
- How much?
- I'm not sure.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.540
My custody case is going to trial.
I don't know how long it'll last.

06:13.428 --> 06:15.550
You'd trade holiday shifts-

06:15.763 --> 06:17.387
- Whatever it takes.
- I'll see.

06:17.598 --> 06:21.642
Chain-reaction pile-up.
They need you at the scene.

06:21.852 --> 06:24.603
- Damn!
- Finish here. I'll take it.

06:24.813 --> 06:26.058
No, I got it.

06:26.273 --> 06:29.357
Even you can't operate
and fly on a chopper at the same time.

06:29.526 --> 06:30.771
I owe you.

06:30.856 --> 06:34.474
Your ER compliance rate's only
78 per cent for the pathway.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.187
I expected better from you.

06:36.570 --> 06:40.520
- It's only the first month's data.
- All the nurses weren't in-serviced yet.

06:40.741 --> 06:45.699
Let's shoot for at least 90 percent
next month, shall we, ladies?

06:46.455 --> 06:47.830
Sorry we're late.

06:48.206 --> 06:51.124
Why the unexpected pleasure
of Dr. Carter's company?

06:51.334 --> 06:53.576
He wants admin experience...

06:53.753 --> 06:58.167
...so I appointed him resident
representative. Thought I told you.

06:58.383 --> 06:59.877
No, you didn't say squat.

07:00.093 --> 07:04.091
- Did you know about this?
- Carter asked. I said no.

07:04.305 --> 07:07.555
Dr. Carter's playing
Mommy against Daddy.

07:07.767 --> 07:12.096
- If you want to discuss this-
- There's nothing to discuss.

07:12.171 --> 07:13.551
Really?

07:13.731 --> 07:17.943
You're comfortable telling our residents
that their opinions are worthless...

07:18.152 --> 07:20.608
...and they're just here to serve you?

07:20.821 --> 07:23.573
Actually, I'd be
very comfortable with that.

07:23.783 --> 07:26.949
I admire the deviousness with which-

07:27.119 --> 07:29.823
Good. Welcome to the
Emergency Services committee.

07:29.997 --> 07:32.286
I have to take off.

07:33.042 --> 07:35.533
So can you take good notes?

07:41.383 --> 07:43.340
So, what's on the agenda?

07:43.635 --> 07:47.335
- He lost 20 pounds. His grades are falling.
- Mom, I'm fine.

07:47.555 --> 07:49.798
- Has your appetite changed?
- No.

07:49.975 --> 07:54.222
- He's doing drugs, I know it.
- I've told you, I don't get high!

07:54.437 --> 07:57.522
- What about your loser friends?
- You don't know anything.

07:57.732 --> 07:59.890
Start with blood tests
to rule out anemia.

08:00.109 --> 08:02.896
- I brought him for a drug test.
- It's not appropriate...

08:03.112 --> 08:06.980
- ... to force that on Chad.
- Who's in charge here?

08:07.158 --> 08:10.823
- Let's call a social worker-
- Is there a problem?

08:10.995 --> 08:15.953
- My son's on drugs. She won't test him.
- Chad denies drug use.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.743
I was urging her to consider
family counseling.

08:19.962 --> 08:21.586
Chad, do you object to testing?

08:24.258 --> 08:27.259
Whatever. If it gets her off my back.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.340
- Problem solved. Run a tox screen.
- Fine.

08:30.556 --> 08:33.924
- Excuse me.
- You're right to question my decisions.

08:34.142 --> 08:37.178
But don't do it in front of my patients.

08:37.354 --> 08:41.981
- You didn't have to choose sides.
- I wasn't choosing sides.

08:42.192 --> 08:45.027
Sometimes the path
of least resistance works best.

08:45.195 --> 08:48.065
Since you've got it all figured out,
you take this case.

08:49.824 --> 08:54.035
Meet Babette Fritzler, 28,
GSW to the shoulder.

08:54.203 --> 08:56.492
- Husband shot her.
- It was an accident.

08:56.706 --> 08:59.992
I was trying to scare the hiccups
out of her.

09:00.210 --> 09:04.041
- Pickle juice is effective and lots safer.
- I'll do this.

09:04.255 --> 09:08.003
No, Carter.
Malucci, get an upright chest x-ray.

09:08.217 --> 09:12.084
- You're doing the positive charts.
- Can't I do that later?

09:12.304 --> 09:16.052
- People may be sick and not know it.
- What do I do?

09:16.267 --> 09:21.178
Review all positive urine and sputum
cultures from the past 72 hours.

09:21.397 --> 09:26.224
Call back any patient who wasn't treated
with the appropriate antibiotic.

09:26.401 --> 09:30.730
Then I want you to check our compliance
on TB-mask fit testing.

09:30.905 --> 09:33.230
You asked for admin experience.

09:33.449 --> 09:36.404
- Yet somehow I feel I'm being punished.
- No pain, no gain.

09:36.578 --> 09:39.781
Multi-car pile-up.
Transporting four to local hospitals.

09:39.998 --> 09:42.405
- Any criticals?
- Truck driver's okay.

09:42.584 --> 09:44.742
Don't know about the guy
under the truck.

09:44.919 --> 09:48.537
- What's this?
- Neck and back pain.

09:48.756 --> 09:51.758
- How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

09:51.927 --> 09:54.713
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

09:54.929 --> 09:57.764
Great. This one's clear
to go by ground.

09:57.974 --> 10:00.595
- What's his status?
- Can't get in to take vitals.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.341
- Is he awake? Talking?
- He was groaning.

10:03.562 --> 10:08.188
- When can we get to him?
- Gas tank's leaking. We foam first.

10:08.401 --> 10:11.520
- How soon?
- Shut it off!

10:13.739 --> 10:17.108
I can't see anything.
Can you break through?

10:17.910 --> 10:20.447
Help me! Please, somebody help!

10:20.620 --> 10:23.289
Can you hear me? What's your name?

10:23.456 --> 10:26.577
- Dean.
- Dean, we're gonna help you.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.035
He's got a weak carotid pulse.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.080
Hang on. We'll get you out.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.086
Hang on!

10:41.349 --> 10:42.973
ER.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.264
No, you don't need an appointment.
Stupid.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.642
- Can you order a stain on this sputum?
- I'm just answering phones.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.230
- What you making?
- What's it look like?

10:53.736 --> 10:56.024
- A blanket.
- It's a hat.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.737
- Sorry. Nice color.
- I want to talk to you.

10:59.950 --> 11:04.280
- Change your mind about the drug test?
- No, I'm waiting for the results.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.031
Fourth year's rough. You want to fly
solo, nobody thinks you're ready.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.453
Excuse me.

11:09.626 --> 11:13.375
I got two members of my choir
out here still need to be seen.

11:13.588 --> 11:15.332
And a cut on my hand.

11:15.590 --> 11:16.918
Cleo.

11:17.133 --> 11:20.834
Assess them, order their tests, and I'll
sign off before you discharge them.

11:21.054 --> 11:22.548
Sure.

11:26.393 --> 11:30.888
- ER.
- Can you order my Gram stain now?

11:38.154 --> 11:40.645
- You the doc?
- Yeah, Corday from County.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.700
- Detective Curson, Violent Crimes. Alive?
- Just about.

11:43.868 --> 11:46.619
- What about his passenger?
- There was no one else in his car.

11:46.829 --> 11:49.616
There should be. He carjacked
a lady this morning.

11:49.832 --> 11:50.911
Help me.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.835
- What'd you do with her?
- Somebody help me!

11:54.045 --> 11:58.588
- Where's the lady you carjacked?
- He's cut his carotid.

11:58.799 --> 12:01.669
He'll need two large-bore IVs.

12:01.885 --> 12:03.794
- Please...
- Don't move.

12:04.012 --> 12:07.926
You've cut an artery. We must remove
the collar to stop your bleeding.

12:08.141 --> 12:10.348
- Tell me where she is.
- Who?

12:10.728 --> 12:13.183
- You know who, you son of a bitch.
- Don't move!

12:13.397 --> 12:17.608
- Back off! Let me work!
- A woman's out there in trouble.

12:18.026 --> 12:21.062
Tape his forehead to the board.
Don't move!

12:22.739 --> 12:25.360
- Don't let me die.
- I'm a doctor. I'll look after you.

12:25.575 --> 12:28.410
Listen to me. There is a woman
out there who could be dying.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.992
Do you understand that?
We gotta find her!

12:43.884 --> 12:45.296
Where is she, Dean?

12:46.429 --> 12:50.675
You're bleeding really badly.
Where is she?

12:50.891 --> 12:55.268
- I don't know.
- BP's down to 70.

12:55.437 --> 12:59.137
It's your last chance.
Do you want to die?

13:01.609 --> 13:03.437
Tell me where she is.

13:03.612 --> 13:07.740
Tell me where or I'll let you
bleed to death. Do you hear?

13:14.956 --> 13:19.534
Lincoln Park, under the bridge.

13:19.753 --> 13:24.379
- She's under the bridge! Lincoln Park!
- Lincoln Park!

13:24.591 --> 13:27.757
We gotta stop his bleeding.
Get me an atraumatic clamp now!

13:57.247 --> 14:00.581
- How's he doing?
- He's stable. I intubated him.

14:00.792 --> 14:03.081
Tied off his carotid?
That's aggressive.

14:03.295 --> 14:06.046
I had no choice.
Are handcuffs necessary?

14:06.256 --> 14:07.287
He can't leave.

14:07.507 --> 14:11.255
Following procedure. He's under arrest
for attempted murder.

14:14.890 --> 14:18.175
I'm Meg Corwin's nurse. She had a boy.

14:18.351 --> 14:20.260
She'd like to see you.

14:20.478 --> 14:22.684
- Why?
- She didn't say.

14:22.855 --> 14:25.476
- How's the baby?
- Quite well under the circumstances.

14:25.691 --> 14:30.603
We got Meg off the heroin before
delivering. She said you got her arrested.

14:30.822 --> 14:33.858
- She refused treatment. I had no choice.
- I'm with you.

14:34.033 --> 14:36.488
- She's on the jail ward.
- Thank you.

14:36.702 --> 14:39.868
- UCAN has a trauma?
- Liz and Peter have it.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.200
- I'll see if they need a hand.
- Not so fast. I checked your list.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.742
- Your TB-mask fitting?
- I'll do it later.

14:45.960 --> 14:50.670
- Set a good example for the residents.
- Let's go.

14:52.050 --> 14:55.336
He's shocky. Type and cross.
Two O-neg units.

14:55.554 --> 14:57.593
- Out of O-neg.
- We must type him.

14:57.806 --> 15:01.009
- We need blood.
- He has a blood-donor card.

15:01.225 --> 15:03.633
"I donated blood. " B-positive!

15:03.853 --> 15:07.305
- I'll order it!
- Blood, C-spine, chest x-ray.

15:07.524 --> 15:11.391
Let's get a gram of ancef
and update the tetanus.

15:11.569 --> 15:15.068
I'll check his chest.
Belly's soft, chest is clear.

15:15.281 --> 15:18.815
- Unstable pelvis. Add an AP.
- Pressure's down, 60 palp.

15:19.034 --> 15:21.822
- He's bleeding. Let's check his back.
- Can't, he's cuffed.

15:22.038 --> 15:23.746
- Uncuff him!
- Not allowed.

15:24.165 --> 15:27.664
- Get the bolt cutters.
- All right, but you're responsible.

15:30.546 --> 15:32.088
All right, go.

15:33.215 --> 15:35.421
- No injury.
- Could be a hematoma.

15:35.592 --> 15:39.092
- I'll do an ultrasound.
- Why not take a break?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.591
- No, I brought him in. I'll stay with him.
- All right.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.718
Where's the competition?

15:45.936 --> 15:50.432
At Navy Pier. They're sending
over a bus to pick us up.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.431
Keep the sutures clean and dry.

15:53.651 --> 15:57.863
- In a week, have a doctor remove them.
- Thank you.

15:58.365 --> 16:01.401
Are you okay? You're breathing fast.

16:01.659 --> 16:05.408
- Let me listen to your lungs.
- I'm fine.

16:05.621 --> 16:08.539
Breathe in and out, deeply.

16:10.793 --> 16:12.536
Again.

16:15.882 --> 16:20.294
You have rales. Wet lungs.
Are you on any medications?

16:20.928 --> 16:25.222
Digoxin and Lasix for
congestive heart failure.

16:25.807 --> 16:30.683
- You need some blood tests.
- I've had this for five years.

16:30.895 --> 16:34.099
I need to go reassign parts.

16:34.483 --> 16:39.310
- Your lungs sound bad.
- So will my choir, without rehearsals.

16:43.491 --> 16:47.738
- Pelvic hematoma.
- May need embolisation. Call Radiology.

16:47.954 --> 16:50.991
- How we doing on that blood?
- Four units on the way.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.453
Radiology's ready.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.751
They must've found her.
The woman he kidnapped. She's alive.

16:55.962 --> 16:57.670
- Pressure's down to 60.
- What?

16:57.839 --> 17:02.417
- Want another liter of saline?
- No. Get the rapid infuser.

17:03.219 --> 17:06.054
Multiple stab wounds to the chest.

17:07.265 --> 17:10.016
- Decreased breathing.
- Put in a chest tube?

17:10.184 --> 17:13.055
- Yeah, 10 blade.
- She's hypotensive. BP 90, pulse 130.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.262
- Blood bank have any O-neg?
- Not yet.

17:15.481 --> 17:18.185
- Does her husband know her blood type?
- No.

17:18.442 --> 17:21.193
- Type and cross for four.
- Are those scratches?

17:21.403 --> 17:25.531
- Step back. We need to work.
- You should look at this.

17:27.367 --> 17:32.278
Abrasions to the external genitalia.
Yosh, get the camera.

17:36.209 --> 17:38.747
Can you describe the man
who stabbed you?

17:40.881 --> 17:44.463
- Where's Ron?
- Try and remember.

17:45.927 --> 17:48.383
- Sats down to 88.
- I gotta intubate.

17:48.596 --> 17:50.754
- Get out.
- I need a positive I.D.

17:51.099 --> 17:53.091
You heard her. Get out now.

17:53.309 --> 17:57.093
I'm putting a tube in your throat
to help you breathe.

17:57.563 --> 18:00.268
Fifteen of etomidate, 100 of sux.

18:00.441 --> 18:01.770
My husband...

18:03.110 --> 18:05.067
Don't worry. He's on his way.

18:05.279 --> 18:07.355
She's bleeding out.
Hang the cell saver.

18:07.573 --> 18:10.242
Run a red top to the blood bank.

18:10.451 --> 18:13.653
Get us four units of type-specific.

18:13.870 --> 18:16.196
Prime the rapid infuser.

18:16.415 --> 18:19.369
- How's the central line?
- I'm almost there.

18:19.585 --> 18:22.621
He can't hold his arm up.

18:22.796 --> 18:23.875
Squeeze my hand.

18:25.048 --> 18:26.376
- Tighter.
- What's wrong?

18:26.633 --> 18:27.961
Right-sided weakness.

18:28.134 --> 18:31.752
- You tied his carotid.
- Should still have good collateral flow.

18:31.971 --> 18:34.593
- I got the B-positive.
- Rapid-infuse it.

18:34.808 --> 18:37.678
We need a shunt. He could stroke out.

18:37.894 --> 18:41.097
Get a Javid from the O.R.
All right, I'm in.

18:41.314 --> 18:43.639
Bring down as many sizes as you can.

18:47.319 --> 18:50.570
Clamp it! Get those clothes off him.

18:50.782 --> 18:53.355
Prep his neck. Get a vascular tray.

18:55.369 --> 18:57.611
- What are you doing?
- Saving his life.

18:57.830 --> 19:00.237
That's evidence. Her blood-

19:00.457 --> 19:02.616
- That was donor blood.
- It doesn't matter.

19:03.085 --> 19:06.619
Don't cut his clothes.
Sorry, I didn't realize.

19:06.838 --> 19:08.748
Separate his belongings.

19:08.966 --> 19:11.208
We gotta get that shunt in.

19:11.427 --> 19:14.178
Don't clean him
until I have a warrant.

19:17.182 --> 19:20.017
- How much?
- I autotransfused a liter.

19:20.185 --> 19:23.304
She's bled another liter.

19:23.521 --> 19:27.520
- Blood bank says 10 more minutes.
- We can't wait. She's lost too much.

19:27.693 --> 19:29.519
See if anyone here's O-neg.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.527
- What's your type?
- B-positive.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.941
- What's your blood type?
- A-positive, why?

19:38.494 --> 19:40.736
- What's your blood type?
- AB.

19:40.955 --> 19:44.870
- O-neg. O-negative.
- You're the man. Come on.

19:45.043 --> 19:47.035
- Carter's O-neg.
- What's going on?

19:47.253 --> 19:50.918
We need you to donate.
Get a 14-gauge needle.

19:51.215 --> 19:55.047
Stab victim needs blood.
No time to type her.

19:55.219 --> 19:58.468
Squeeze in another two liters
of saline.

19:58.680 --> 20:02.050
How about numbing it
with lidocaine!

20:02.226 --> 20:04.468
- I got a flash.
- Keep your arm straight.

20:04.687 --> 20:06.975
It's a needle, not a catheter.

20:07.189 --> 20:10.522
- She's tachycardic. Heart's 140.
- Get the paddles.

20:10.942 --> 20:12.982
Vessel loops in place.

20:13.194 --> 20:16.812
I'll cannulate the proximal shunt end.
We'll flush it out.

20:17.032 --> 20:21.907
- We don't want an air embolism.
- I'll do the distal end.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.615
- What?
- Shunt won't advance.

20:25.832 --> 20:28.998
You could be raising an intimal flap.

20:29.210 --> 20:33.421
- He's throwing PVCs.
- Get 100 of lidocaine. Prep a drip.

20:34.131 --> 20:37.715
- I'm in.
- Distal vessel loops are secure.

20:37.927 --> 20:41.675
Let's open the shunt
and see how he does.

20:41.889 --> 20:44.427
With any luck, he'll stand trial.

20:44.934 --> 20:47.804
- Blood's ready.
- Hang it on the infuser.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.763
- You're a good bleeder.
- What can I do?

20:49.938 --> 20:53.771
- Get yourself juice and cookies.
- I'm fine.

20:54.110 --> 20:55.936
Nice job! Go!

20:56.529 --> 20:59.233
- Pressure's dropping.
- We gotta control the bleeding.

20:59.448 --> 21:02.614
- I put in another chest tube.
- Oh, my God.

21:03.452 --> 21:06.903
- Sir, you have to leave.
- My wife, she'll be all right?

21:07.163 --> 21:09.620
We're doing everything we can.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.668
- Where is that music coming from?
- Lucy's gospel singers.

21:12.878 --> 21:15.795
Ask them to stop singing
so we can work.

21:15.964 --> 21:18.799
Lost her pressure. Thoracotomy tray.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.626
What are you doing?

21:21.969 --> 21:26.133
- We have to stop the bleeding.
- Get him out. We need a sternal saw.

21:39.445 --> 21:42.694
- Dr. Weaver wants them to stop.
- What?

21:42.906 --> 21:45.824
Please, quiet down!

21:45.993 --> 21:48.911
I'm sorry. You can't sing in here.

21:49.330 --> 21:53.113
- We'll rehearse outside.
- You can't leave.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.869
- We're waiting for blood tests.
- Take it up with Dr. Weaver.

21:58.713 --> 22:00.836
- Where you going?
- I gotta pee.

22:01.007 --> 22:04.957
- Do I have to go in a cup again?
- No, you can flush.

22:05.178 --> 22:10.006
- Is Chad's drug test back?
- Tox screen came back negative.

22:10.225 --> 22:13.391
- That's good news.
- But his liver function's abnormal.

22:13.603 --> 22:17.185
- Could you add a blood-alcohol level?
- Sure.

22:19.067 --> 22:21.772
You okay? I need a hand.
She's presyncopal.

22:21.986 --> 22:23.611
- I'm just dizzy.
- Yeah, okay.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.652
- I'm okay.
- Breathe deeply.

22:27.116 --> 22:29.155
- I'm fine.
- She's probably hypotensive.

22:29.368 --> 22:31.277
We'll monitor you and the babies.

22:31.495 --> 22:35.539
- Come on, I'm all right.
- Carol, breathe.

22:39.086 --> 22:42.289
- I've got the blood.
- Hang it on the rapid infuser.

22:42.506 --> 22:44.545
Pulmonary vein's shredded.

22:44.758 --> 22:47.510
She's losing blood fast.

22:47.719 --> 22:50.886
- Give me suction.
- Two-0 silk and pickups.

22:51.056 --> 22:55.054
- Hilum is clamped.
- Take over compressions.

22:55.227 --> 22:57.516
- She's in fib.
- Heart's filling.

22:57.729 --> 23:01.976
Give me the paddles. Charge to 30.
And clear.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.476
Let's take him to Radiology.

23:04.694 --> 23:07.399
- Do you still need me?
- I'll take him.

23:10.116 --> 23:12.951
You go on. I'll be up in a minute.

23:16.122 --> 23:18.992
Tell me what they're doing
to my wife?

23:19.208 --> 23:22.209
They're shocking her heart
so it beats again.

23:25.589 --> 23:27.416
Why are they stopping?

23:32.471 --> 23:35.389
Mr. Perry, we need to talk to you.

24:00.518 --> 24:04.562
- They okay?
- Good variability. No contractions.

24:04.730 --> 24:08.560
- They' re great. I'm worried about you.
- I take it easy.

24:08.732 --> 24:10.937
There's no taking it easy in the ER.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.100
You're in your third trimester with twins,
you should rest at home.

24:15.319 --> 24:18.402
- Heard you collapsed.
- I didn't collapse. I'm fine.

24:18.613 --> 24:22.989
Her blood pressure was low.
Normal for this stage of the pregnancy.

24:23.491 --> 24:25.648
- Call me if you have problems.
- Thanks.

24:26.243 --> 24:28.697
- You need to-
- Go home. I know.

24:29.369 --> 24:32.737
- How's your dad?
- He never got off the plane.

24:32.955 --> 24:35.871
- Was it the right flight?
- The only morning San Diego flight.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.661
The airline wouldn't give me
any information.

24:39.126 --> 24:42.410
- Did you call him at home?
- And I called a neighbor.

24:42.628 --> 24:45.876
She went to the house. No sign of him.

24:46.130 --> 24:47.920
Maybe he took a later flight.

24:48.131 --> 24:51.878
Or he's lost somewhere
in the continental United States.

24:57.345 --> 25:01.294
- Guess I'm off the hook, huh?
- Not quite.

25:01.515 --> 25:06.340
- Your tests are crap. I'm clean.
- You're drunk.

25:06.559 --> 25:10.342
If you call this drunk, lady,
you don't get out much.

25:12.730 --> 25:14.556
When was your last drink?

25:15.941 --> 25:19.024
- Had a few beers last night.
- More than a few...

25:19.233 --> 25:21.689
...to have alcohol
in your blood this afternoon.

25:21.861 --> 25:27.445
Maybe a couple of six-packs.
I don't remember.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.731
Because you blacked out?

25:32.367 --> 25:35.486
You have liver damage
from the alcohol.

25:35.703 --> 25:38.738
You've done some
seriously heavy drinking.

25:39.247 --> 25:43.573
I like to party with my friends.
Nothing wrong with that.

25:44.833 --> 25:48.616
- We need to talk to your mom.
- What'll she say?

25:48.836 --> 25:51.586
She gets bombed every night herself.

26:03.386 --> 26:08.295
She just went to go get us coffee.
That's all.

26:09.432 --> 26:12.965
Could we speak to you outside?

26:16.186 --> 26:17.727
I can't leave.

26:19.437 --> 26:20.847
Not yet.

26:21.606 --> 26:25.768
We must talk to you about something
that's very difficult.

26:27.943 --> 26:31.108
We have to do a rape exam
on your wife.

26:37.156 --> 26:38.949
Please come with us.

26:50.290 --> 26:53.373
I'm very sorry, but I must ask...

26:53.584 --> 26:58.375
Have you had intercourse with your
wife in the past 72 hours?

26:59.130 --> 27:00.457
Why?

27:03.965 --> 27:08.708
If the exam's positive,
we have to make sure it wasn't you.

27:28.563 --> 27:32.146
His internal iliac's bleeding.
We'll embolise the vessel.

27:32.358 --> 27:36.307
- Any other signs of hemorrhage?
- No, he lucked out.

27:36.528 --> 27:39.776
But he's got a fractured pelvis,
shredded carotid...

27:39.946 --> 27:43.693
...dislocated hip, torn hypogastric.

27:43.906 --> 27:47.819
All of us might not put Humpty
back together again.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.991
Step out please.
We're taking x-rays.

27:50.161 --> 27:53.777
I have a warrant to gather evidence.
His charges have changed.

27:54.163 --> 27:58.373
- What do you need to do?
- Fingerprints, scrape under his nails.

27:58.583 --> 28:00.455
It's murder one, pal.

28:17.469 --> 28:22.757
- Your lungs are better with the Lasix.
- Stuff made me pee like a fountain.

28:22.972 --> 28:27.301
- We gotta head out.
- We need the test results first.

28:27.643 --> 28:32.682
I won't disappoint my choir.
I'll be back right after the concert.

28:32.895 --> 28:36.512
- We're leaving.
- You're leaving against medical advice.

28:36.730 --> 28:39.482
You must sign a waiver.
I'll get a doctor.

28:39.690 --> 28:44.067
- You're not a doctor?
- I'm a medical student. Stay there!

28:44.278 --> 28:46.483
If he resists help, we can't do much.

28:46.696 --> 28:49.648
If he keeps it up, he'll kill himself
or someone else.

28:49.864 --> 28:53.528
I can refer you to some
treatment programs.

28:53.742 --> 28:56.492
I offered that. He refused.
Can't we commit him?

28:56.702 --> 28:59.027
Not for being an alcoholic.

28:59.246 --> 29:02.032
What if I convince the mom
to do so?

29:02.248 --> 29:06.788
Mr. Owens is leaving.
He's in congestive heart failure.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.122
- What's his EKG?
- No ST changes.

29:09.418 --> 29:12.371
I'm waiting on the cardiac enzymes.

29:12.586 --> 29:13.784
Where is he?

29:17.006 --> 29:20.125
- Why didn't you get me sooner?
- Thought I could do it.

29:20.341 --> 29:23.674
If his enzymes show he's had
a heart attack, you better find him.

29:28.846 --> 29:30.969
How was the committee meeting?

29:31.181 --> 29:33.672
I'll let you read the minutes.

29:33.892 --> 29:36.347
Cab company from San Diego called.

29:36.561 --> 29:39.844
They dropped your dad off
at the airport.

29:40.020 --> 29:43.518
- Any other leads?
- Not yet. Why are you here?

29:43.731 --> 29:47.513
- No time cards, no pay.
- Can't somebody else do it?

29:47.733 --> 29:52.145
It'll take so long to explain it.
I'd be doing this at home anyway.

29:52.362 --> 29:54.851
- Take it easy.
- Yes, doctor.

29:55.030 --> 29:58.148
The neurologist wants you
or Dr. Weaver to come up.

29:58.365 --> 29:59.906
Where's Kerry?

30:00.116 --> 30:02.902
- Doing a rape exam.
- Tell him I'm on my way.

30:03.117 --> 30:07.328
A girl named Meg called.
Really wants to see you.

30:07.537 --> 30:08.865
Thanks.

30:15.626 --> 30:17.167
It's a volcano.

30:17.543 --> 30:20.875
Mount Etna? Vesuvius?
I couldn't tell you.

30:21.045 --> 30:22.290
Volcano will do.

30:22.505 --> 30:25.873
- This is ridiculous. I feel like a lab rat.
- Just bear with me.

30:26.049 --> 30:28.172
Fine. Give me the cheese.

30:28.425 --> 30:30.050
What's this?

30:30.886 --> 30:33.043
Martini glass without the base.

30:33.971 --> 30:35.713
Or it's a...

30:40.432 --> 30:41.891
It's a cone.

30:42.351 --> 30:45.470
- Right?
- Let's try another one.

30:45.686 --> 30:47.180
What's this?

30:50.731 --> 30:54.596
The picker-uppers to put ice
in a martini glass.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.938
They're also called...

30:58.527 --> 31:01.231
- Call them whatever you like.
- Tongs.

31:01.446 --> 31:03.853
- Tongs? Who cares?
- How about-

31:04.073 --> 31:07.108
- No, stop this nonsense!
- We're not quite finished.

31:07.366 --> 31:11.907
I am. I won't sit here and play guessing
games with you and lousy drawings.

31:17.748 --> 31:19.123
I'm sorry.

31:19.915 --> 31:23.912
Let's take a short break.
I'll be right back.

31:24.127 --> 31:26.270
Don't rush.

31:45.532 --> 31:47.406
Saline.

32:07.887 --> 32:10.805
- Ready for the Wood's lamp?
- Yeah, please.

32:22.026 --> 32:23.935
I see a spot.

32:36.164 --> 32:38.323
It looks like semen.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.459
That's it.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.045
Finished up?

32:55.600 --> 32:59.467
Waiting for the test results.
Sit. Share my boredom.

33:00.021 --> 33:04.101
- Grab a cup of coffee?
- Sure. Why not?

33:04.317 --> 33:05.942
How are things going?

33:06.945 --> 33:10.444
For a doc who can't practice
medicine, can't complain.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.610
I called your son. He's on his way.

33:13.826 --> 33:18.452
No. I told that neurologist
I don't want my son involved.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.831
You can't enlist in a clinical trial
without a caregiver.

33:22.043 --> 33:25.577
Someone has to make sure
you take your meds.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.506
My son is not gonna babysit me.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.882
You took care of him
when he needed you. Now it's his turn.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.671
That's just it.

33:34.262 --> 33:38.260
I was busy being a doctor,
too busy helping everybody else.

33:38.434 --> 33:41.351
Let your son decide, okay?

33:41.561 --> 33:43.768
No, I won't be a burden to him.

33:43.980 --> 33:48.227
That new neurotrophin
might give you more time.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.194
What difference will
a few more months make?

33:51.404 --> 33:55.484
You'd give up because you're too proud
to ask your son for help?

34:02.873 --> 34:04.866
If he says yes...

34:06.168 --> 34:09.168
...I'll still end up
the way I'll end up.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.716
I don't think I could bear
his saying no.

34:19.764 --> 34:22.469
Talk to him. He might say yes.

34:29.065 --> 34:30.893
I think it's too late.

34:33.195 --> 34:35.271
I'll clean out my locker.

34:42.245 --> 34:47.038
- We'll tack down a tear of the carotid.
- Sounds like a plan.

34:47.250 --> 34:50.949
- I hear you had quite a day.
- I'm not in the mood.

34:51.170 --> 34:53.744
Perhaps you'll want to hear this:

34:53.965 --> 34:58.342
- Your patient raped that woman.
- Oh, dear God...

35:00.512 --> 35:04.297
A public defender investigator
was just here.

35:04.475 --> 35:06.100
It seems some bleeding heart...

35:06.310 --> 35:10.888
...claims you coerced Rollins
to tell you where he left her.

35:13.817 --> 35:16.771
Did you coerce him for information
to save his life?

35:16.987 --> 35:20.320
- You're out of line.
- It's okay, I'll answer that.

35:20.490 --> 35:24.488
It's fair to say I pressured
Mr. Rollins.

35:24.703 --> 35:29.246
You never fail to impress me.
I didn't think you'd cross that line.

35:31.334 --> 35:35.497
You may want to reflect on if that's how
you'd really characterize what happened.

35:35.671 --> 35:38.423
Because, unfortunately, in this country...

35:38.632 --> 35:43.010
...when a confession's coerced,
it's usually thrown out.

35:55.482 --> 35:57.689
I'm here to see Meg Corwin.

36:01.989 --> 36:03.020
Change your mind?

36:03.240 --> 36:07.403
- I wanted to see the baby.
- Social Services will be here soon.

36:07.619 --> 36:12.079
Crazy locking her in like this,
but it's County's rules.

36:12.290 --> 36:14.118
- Hi, Meg.
- Hi.

36:14.710 --> 36:16.252
This is Joshua.

36:16.462 --> 36:19.166
He's beautiful. Hi, Joshua.

36:19.881 --> 36:23.001
They' re sending me back to jail.

36:23.176 --> 36:26.212
I need you to tell them that Joshua
should stay with me.

36:26.429 --> 36:30.261
- That would do no good.
- You did this.

36:30.599 --> 36:33.934
If you hadn't gotten me busted,
I wouldn't be here right now.

36:34.145 --> 36:37.479
I did what I thought best
for both of you.

36:37.690 --> 36:40.062
I'll be in jail ten months.

36:40.276 --> 36:43.277
Think that's what's best for him?

36:43.487 --> 36:46.488
I know it's hard,
but if you get your life back together...

36:46.698 --> 36:49.700
...and prove that to them
I'm sure you can get Joshua back.

36:49.911 --> 36:52.402
How can you be so damn self-righteous?

36:52.705 --> 36:55.374
Meg, Social Services is here.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.207
Just give me a little more time.

36:57.418 --> 37:00.087
You know the rules.
Moms can't keep their babies in jail.

37:00.253 --> 37:03.171
This isn't right.
I know I screwed up bad.

37:03.506 --> 37:04.538
He needs me.

37:04.716 --> 37:08.168
- Please do something.
- There's nothing I can do.

37:08.387 --> 37:10.178
- Please!
- I'm sorry.

37:10.389 --> 37:12.262
Please. You did this!

37:12.474 --> 37:16.092
Let him stay a little while longer.

37:16.895 --> 37:21.722
- Can you open this door?!
- Just a moment. Yes, sorry.

37:22.066 --> 37:25.649
- Open this door now, please!
- I'm his mother!

37:28.865 --> 37:31.735
Please don't take my baby!
I'm his mother!

37:31.909 --> 37:36.072
- You can get some sleep.
- Mama loves you, honey!

37:36.247 --> 37:38.737
- Come with me.
- I love you!

37:38.916 --> 37:42.831
- We'll be back for you.
- I'm his mother!

37:48.550 --> 37:50.590
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for my ride.

37:50.803 --> 37:54.088
Wife found him unconscious.
Seized for three minutes.

37:54.306 --> 37:57.259
Gave him two of Ativan.
History of Type Two diabetes.

37:57.434 --> 37:59.142
- He's seizing!
- Two more of Ativan.

37:59.353 --> 38:02.852
Load him up with Dilantin,
15 per kilo. Page Dr. Weaver.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.852
- I guess I got worked up over nothing.
- Alcohol abuse is hardly nothing.

38:08.069 --> 38:11.770
So he had a few beers with friends.
Thank God it's not speed or coke!

38:11.990 --> 38:16.202
Your son's an alcoholic.
He has a serious problem.

38:16.411 --> 38:19.282
With your permission I can refer Chad
to a treatment program.

38:19.456 --> 38:22.373
I brought him here for a drug test.

38:22.583 --> 38:24.825
Not to test him for alcohol.

38:25.044 --> 38:28.876
- Your son needs help.
- He's not on drugs, right?

38:29.089 --> 38:32.423
Are you avoiding this
because you have a drinking problem?

38:34.804 --> 38:37.970
How dare you? Come on, Chad.

38:44.271 --> 38:46.062
- How much Dilantin?
- Four hundred mg.

38:46.273 --> 38:47.850
Keep pushing it.

38:48.066 --> 38:50.605
PH low, 6.95. Potassium's 6.8.

38:50.820 --> 38:53.108
- Why's he acidemic?
- He's diabetic.

38:53.322 --> 38:54.816
Blood glucose is normal.

38:55.032 --> 38:58.235
- Is he septic?
- Temp and white count are normal.

38:58.452 --> 39:01.121
- Seizure stopped.
- I don't understand.

39:01.329 --> 39:03.322
He's throwing PVC's.

39:03.539 --> 39:06.659
- What's going on?
- He's seizing again.

39:06.834 --> 39:10.120
He's gonna arrest.
Can you help me?

39:10.338 --> 39:12.663
- I don't work here.
- Please, a guy's coding.

39:12.882 --> 39:14.460
His pH is falling.
His potassium's rising.

39:14.676 --> 39:17.166
He's having refractory seizures. Please.

39:18.679 --> 39:22.677
It's nothing obvious.
It's not DKA or sepsis.

39:22.850 --> 39:26.219
- He's throwing multi-focal PVC's.
- Get six of Pavulon.

39:26.437 --> 39:28.015
- Just do it.
- What's going on?

39:28.189 --> 39:32.269
Guy with seizures, acidemia.
Dr. Lawrence says give him Pavulon.

39:32.443 --> 39:33.557
Push it!

39:33.777 --> 39:36.482
I've never given Pavulon
for acidemia and seizures.

39:36.697 --> 39:39.366
It's strychnine poisoning. I'll do it.

39:48.959 --> 39:50.951
It worked. How did you know?

39:51.378 --> 39:55.375
Strychnine antagonizes glycine's
central inhibition...

39:55.590 --> 40:00.087
...causing hyperexcitation.
I had a case like this 20 years ago.

40:00.304 --> 40:04.301
A patient tried to commit suicide
by eating Gopher Go.

40:04.516 --> 40:07.766
You can't forget what strychnine
poisoning looks like.

40:07.977 --> 40:11.393
Check his pH.
I bet it's coming back up.

40:11.564 --> 40:15.478
- Your patient will recover.
- Thank you.

40:15.693 --> 40:18.730
Score one for the
absent-minded professor.

40:23.034 --> 40:24.232
I gotta go.

40:36.714 --> 40:41.174
That patient would've died
if you hadn't been here.

40:42.052 --> 40:44.887
This old dog can still teach you
a few new tricks.

40:45.096 --> 40:47.255
I wouldn't be here without you.

40:48.433 --> 40:51.766
I just gave you a little push
in the right direction.

40:52.938 --> 40:54.349
What are you gonna do?

40:55.774 --> 40:59.059
Mark had my son stop by today.

41:00.445 --> 41:02.271
We talked, and...

41:05.950 --> 41:10.577
- I agreed to live with him.
- I'm glad.

41:11.497 --> 41:13.289
He's picking me up now.

41:21.381 --> 41:22.959
I'll see you, Kerry.

41:23.258 --> 41:24.800
I'll see you.

41:44.321 --> 41:46.148
- Find that patient?
- Nobody's seen him.

41:46.323 --> 41:47.651
What have you got?

41:47.824 --> 41:51.524
Fifty-five-year-old male, headache and
chest pain along with gospel singers.

41:51.744 --> 41:55.658
- We suspect carbon-monoxide poisoning.
- This is all your fault.

41:55.831 --> 41:59.876
- We missed the festival.
- Don't lose him this time.

42:02.505 --> 42:05.625
- Mark?
- Dad? You all right?

42:06.092 --> 42:08.333
Where you been?
I've been worried about you.

42:08.552 --> 42:12.846
I'm fine. A little tired,
but 200 bucks richer.

42:13.057 --> 42:14.337
My flight was overbooked.

42:14.516 --> 42:18.181
I volunteered to take a later one.
They actually paid me.

42:19.230 --> 42:22.599
You don't have to do that.
I can buy you a ticket.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.350
I can afford my own ticket.

42:26.528 --> 42:29.482
- How about a tour?
- I've been in plenty of hospitals.

42:29.698 --> 42:31.026
Not this one.

42:31.241 --> 42:34.360
- You're the boss here?
- One of them.

42:38.332 --> 42:41.368
Dr. Kovac, thank you.

42:42.419 --> 42:43.699
For what?

42:43.962 --> 42:48.670
- For doing a good job on a tough case.
- Until next time.

42:50.718 --> 42:54.384
Luka, I would like you to stay.

42:54.931 --> 42:56.508
Permanently.

42:57.016 --> 43:00.385
There's an opening here
since Dr. Lawrence is leaving.

43:02.605 --> 43:04.312
- Okay.
- Great.

43:06.733 --> 43:09.734
- Want to know the pay?
- It'll be fair.

43:10.737 --> 43:13.145
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

43:16.076 --> 43:18.532
- What's his blood loss?
- Seven hundred cc's.

43:18.745 --> 43:21.781
- Give him another unit.
- Normal sinus at 100.

43:21.998 --> 43:25.414
Lucky bastard.
I should've let him die.

43:25.585 --> 43:28.871
You got him to talk so they found her.

43:29.089 --> 43:31.295
A fat lot of good that did.

43:31.508 --> 43:35.042
She didn't die alone outside
under a bridge.

43:36.513 --> 43:38.339
- He's in v-tach!
- Pressure dropping.

43:38.556 --> 43:40.098
Get the paddles!

43:40.266 --> 43:43.682
- Charge to 200.
- Paddles are charged.

43:43.894 --> 43:47.940
What do you want to do, Elizabeth?
Elizabeth?

43:50.777 --> 43:52.105
Clear!

43:54.530 --> 43:55.858
He's back.
