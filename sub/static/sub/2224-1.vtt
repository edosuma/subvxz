01:07.040 --> 01:08.951
Left! 3rd!

01:20.360 --> 01:27.789
Jean-Louis Schlesser in his mean
machine, No.10. 10 like Zidane!

01:30.600 --> 01:33.478
30 meters, left! Brake!

01:35.560 --> 01:38.996
World rally champion in '98 and '99...

01:39.160 --> 01:42.630
winner of the Paris - Dakar:
The man to beat!

01:47.000 --> 01:48.877
Left, top speed!

01:51.720 --> 01:54.837
Get a move on! We'll get slaughtered.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.638
I’m flat out!

01:58.920 --> 02:02.754
The guy behind's flatter out! Watch out!

02:02.920 --> 02:07.755
He's flashing me! Isn't that Vatanen?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.273
No, a taxi!

02:11.400 --> 02:14.676
Move your crate! I’m working here!

02:14.840 --> 02:18.469
Is it the right road?
- Short cut!

02:18.640 --> 02:19.550
Short cut.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.359
Don't let a taxi win!
- No way.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.955
Sorry, folks. A tourist's blocks the road!

02:30.120 --> 02:32.111
It looks more like a race car.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.278
It's just a clown in a "babe magnet"!

02:35.440 --> 02:38.398
A taxi on our tail sure looks bad!

02:38.560 --> 02:40.118
I’ll shake him now.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.478
He rammed me!

02:45.840 --> 02:48.559
Enough! We'll be here all week!

02:55.960 --> 02:58.474
Nearly there, lady.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.037
Why... why are there so many people here?

03:07.200 --> 03:09.191
They're in vacation.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.839
Oh, right!

03:11.480 --> 03:13.596
C'mon, Jean-Louis!
- Bravo, Jean-Louis!

03:13.760 --> 03:17.594
No.10... It’s not Schlesser!

03:17.760 --> 03:19.113
A taxi.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.153
I didn't catch his number.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.870
17 minutes 25 secs!

03:40.080 --> 03:44.278
People always throw up after! Never during!

03:44.440 --> 03:45.793
OK, lady?

03:47.440 --> 03:50.273
Who's it for?
- Her! Her water broke!

03:50.440 --> 03:51.793
May I?

03:53.400 --> 03:57.154
You're giving birth!
- Well, I ain't knitting!

03:57.320 --> 03:59.311
Get the gear! We'll do it here!

03:59.480 --> 04:03.712
Hey, doc, I gotta run.
Use the ground, not my seat!

04:03.880 --> 04:05.871
Water's broken!

04:06.040 --> 04:07.393
Water breaks?

04:08.920 --> 04:10.273
Push!

04:11.600 --> 04:14.160
Breathe! Push!

04:19.880 --> 04:21.233
Hi, Lilly.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.597
30 minutes late for lunch with my folks!

04:24.760 --> 04:26.432
Yeah, I’m on my way.

04:26.600 --> 04:31.549
Daniel, you're finally meeting my Dad.
He's expecting you!

04:31.720 --> 04:34.314
This is a super-big emergency!

04:34.480 --> 04:36.948
What are my folks? Diesel?

04:37.120 --> 04:38.473
Lilly, come on!

04:38.640 --> 04:43.031
Mom's edgy, Dad's pacing the floor.
But hey, take your time!

04:43.200 --> 04:46.636
I can't help it, I’m stuck tight here!

04:49.960 --> 04:52.554
"Stuck"? Who's yelling?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.073
It’s... a woman.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.915
Thanks! I guessed that much! What's up?

04:58.080 --> 05:02.358
I’m just watching.
It’s not what you think, you hear me?

05:02.520 --> 05:06.308
I can hear that bitch! Is it someone I know?

05:06.480 --> 05:09.950
No! I don't know her either! I just met her!

05:10.120 --> 05:11.951
Oh, I feel it now!

05:12.120 --> 05:13.473
I feel it!

05:15.680 --> 05:17.750
Don't fuck with me!

05:17.920 --> 05:21.515
You've got some slut there
while I wait for you!

05:21.680 --> 05:25.639
No! This big woman's yelling
'cause her water snapped!

05:25.800 --> 05:29.952
Her husband's here.
- Husband, too? A threesome in a car!

05:30.120 --> 05:34.193
Oh, no! Someone tell her!
I don't know I can.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.590
Here! This is your fault.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.548
I’m the husband. It’s marvellous!

05:41.720 --> 05:44.314
Daniel, he's dead meat!

05:44.480 --> 05:49.270
He's all shook up, that's all.
Want to talk to the doctor?

05:49.440 --> 05:51.078
A doctor, too!

05:51.240 --> 05:53.754
Lilly, I swear it's the truth!

05:53.920 --> 05:57.390
The baby's coming out.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.189
It’s a baby, I swear!
- A baby?

06:01.360 --> 06:03.749
I see the head! I think it's a head!

06:03.920 --> 06:05.273
Your baby?

06:05.440 --> 06:09.035
No, it's not! He's nothing like me I swear!

06:09.200 --> 06:12.636
He's as wrinkly as an old garden gnome!

06:13.800 --> 06:15.153
Marvellous!

06:15.320 --> 06:18.198
You're messing me about!
- Just listen!

06:18.360 --> 06:23.992
This woman just gave birth.
Outside the clinic, in my taxi!

06:24.160 --> 06:27.232
She's ruined my back seat!

06:28.480 --> 06:31.950
Don't hit that poor kid!
I can't hear a thing now!

06:32.120 --> 06:34.236
Marvellous!

06:34.400 --> 06:36.868
You be there when I give birth!

06:37.040 --> 06:41.238
I can sit and wait if you like.
This place looks fine.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.231
You got 10 minutes!

06:44.360 --> 06:46.351
Not twins? Is it a wrap?

06:46.520 --> 06:49.114
No offence, but I gotta run!

06:50.080 --> 06:51.433
Ah, hon!

06:51.600 --> 06:53.591
Problem with your friend?

06:53.760 --> 06:57.799
An emergency at the hospital.
A difficult birth.

06:57.960 --> 07:03.671
I understand.
Saving lives all day. I respect that.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.915
I don't know what to say.
You were wonderful!

07:13.080 --> 07:17.358
I know!
- I hope you won't lose your license.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.193
I don't have one!

07:23.800 --> 07:28.032
I am quite pleased... moved, even...

07:28.200 --> 07:31.988
to give you... your first...

07:32.160 --> 07:33.991
driver's...

07:34.160 --> 07:35.513
license!

07:35.680 --> 07:37.796
You sure?
- Yep!

07:37.960 --> 07:40.076
I don't want to twist your arm.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.437
No doubt about it, it's just fine!

07:43.600 --> 07:46.433
It’s not 'cause it's my 27th time?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.239
Your 100th time would be the same!

07:49.400 --> 07:52.551
You're ready. Really ready.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.274
OK, I accept.
- That's fine.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.557
I’ll back out.
- No!

07:59.720 --> 08:00.994
Leave it!

08:01.160 --> 08:02.513
Don't touch! Leave it!

08:02.680 --> 08:04.955
I’ll do it! I’ll sort it out!

08:05.120 --> 08:08.430
We'll sort it out!

08:08.600 --> 08:10.511
Don't I have my license?

08:10.680 --> 08:14.468
Yes, you do! But don't go to extremes.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.790
Take it smoothly.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.315
Your license is in your hand.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.359
Now you go home. On foot! See?

08:23.520 --> 08:26.990
I see. I’ll call tomorrow
in case you regret it.

08:27.160 --> 08:31.756
No! I won't be around,
nor the following days.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.991
I got transferred to Paris.

08:35.159 --> 08:40.075
This a leaving present?
- For my most regular pupil!

08:40.240 --> 08:41.798
Yeah, right.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.793
"Regular"!

08:48.760 --> 08:50.398
Car Weekly, please.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.152
That's OK.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.878
My pleasure!

09:02.920 --> 09:04.911
Mom, he's here.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.275
Yes, of course! Let's eat!

09:19.240 --> 09:21.356
Sorry, it won't happen again.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.752
Not if you screw this up!
My dad's real strict.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.993
Oh, come on, deep down, he must be nice.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.072
His daughter's eyes are so blue!

09:33.240 --> 09:36.869
You just be careful!
- Don't worry, it'll be OK.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.669
I know I’ll like him, so he'll like me!

09:40.840 --> 09:42.512
Is he a cop?
- No!

09:42.680 --> 09:46.514
OK, then! Ain't nothing worse than a cop!

09:49.560 --> 09:53.633
Dad? I’d like you
to meet my boyfriend, Daniel.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.435
You're a doctor?

10:02.240 --> 10:04.754
Go on. Knock him dead!

10:07.160 --> 10:10.914
Pleased to meet you.
I’ve heard so much about you.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.436
Are you deaf or won't you answer?

10:17.080 --> 10:20.072
I’m not a doctor. I’m an apprentice!

10:20.240 --> 10:21.992
What year?

10:22.160 --> 10:25.835
1st. I mean, I’m about to change into 2nd.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.595
2nd year? You're not young.
- Edmond!

10:29.760 --> 10:34.231
What? I’m just inspecting
a new recruit. Answer!

10:34.400 --> 10:36.152
Sir, I’m not young,

10:36.320 --> 10:39.153
but I’ve done lots of jobs
to feed my family...

10:39.320 --> 10:41.390
and pay for my license... studies.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.599
I started when I was 12, so I’ve aged.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.239
What jobs?

10:47.400 --> 10:50.392
I drive a taxi... ambulance. Ambulance!

10:50.560 --> 10:52.710
I got delayed at the clinic.

10:52.880 --> 10:57.715
It lets me keep my hand in.
Eye in the road, eye on the patient.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.714
2 things at once: you make mistakes!

11:01.880 --> 11:06.749
Excuse me, sir, but I disagree.
Just look at you.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.319
Oh? What do you mean?

11:08.480 --> 11:11.119
I see a lot of decorations there...

11:11.280 --> 11:14.716
proving you've had a successful career.

11:14.880 --> 11:19.635
Then I see Lilly:
pretty, intelligent, well-educated.

11:19.800 --> 11:24.794
You clearly managed to do 2 things at once.

11:25.960 --> 11:29.236
I drove an ambulance, too,
in '59 in Algeria.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.789
Eye on the road, eye on the machine gun!

11:31.960 --> 11:35.953
See to the injured later.
If they're still alive!

11:37.120 --> 11:39.680
I’d like to see my roast beef!

11:39.840 --> 11:43.150
Affirmative! I’m starving! Forward!

11:43.320 --> 11:47.233
Now, the endurance test:
3 hours of war stories!

11:47.400 --> 11:51.234
I’ll slip into neutral and cruise through!

11:55.640 --> 11:57.790
I hurt you?
- Not at all.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.794
Good. I heard your hip crack.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.554
It’s mine!
- Let's stop.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.995
I’m fine!

12:07.160 --> 12:11.438
I don't want to hurt you, but I’ll be OK.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.591
I’m OK now.

12:13.760 --> 12:19.551
I could've massaged it for you.
But if you're OK. Fine!

12:19.720 --> 12:21.676
The surface pain's gone...

12:21.840 --> 12:25.435
but deep down,
there's a nagging pain, a stiffness.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.990
Maybe a little massage
would ease it.

12:30.080 --> 12:35.871
OK, guys, a match to finish,
for 5 minutes. Bow!

12:36.040 --> 12:38.873
Change partners?
- No.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.759
I really don't want to hurt you.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.629
I’m touched by your concern, Emilien.

12:50.560 --> 12:56.874
Now I warn you, I started, aged 4.
I can teach you a thing or two!

13:04.280 --> 13:09.400
Your smile could melt a radiator!
You put me off!

13:12.000 --> 13:16.596
Real opponents don't smile! It’s not fair!

13:21.600 --> 13:23.830
Listen up, you sumos!

13:24.000 --> 13:28.152
Meeting with the boss in 5 minutes!

13:29.480 --> 13:31.948
What's up? You lost your lenses?

13:32.120 --> 13:36.557
I can see you well enough to kick your ass!

13:36.720 --> 13:38.950
Just trying to help!

13:41.200 --> 13:43.430
You done much judo?
- No.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.194
Only a couple of times. It’s not my sport.

13:46.360 --> 13:50.638
So, what is?
- Karate. Far more effective!

13:50.800 --> 13:54.793
Mine's ping-pong.
No good in fights, same principle:

13:54.960 --> 13:56.234
Spirit of Rising Sun!

13:58.440 --> 13:59.873
Kon-ichi-wa!

14:00.040 --> 14:02.508
It’s easy.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.593
"Con". "Consummate idiot" like Emilien!

14:06.760 --> 14:08.352
Thanks!

14:08.520 --> 14:09.873
Then, "ninny" like...

14:10.040 --> 14:13.555
Sorry, Pétra. It’s just an example.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.874
And "a" as in "aaaa"! Kon-ichi-wa!

14:19.040 --> 14:20.598
Now, you.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.954
Not bad.
- What's it mean?

14:26.120 --> 14:30.033
It means "hello" in Japanese.
And don't forget it!

14:30.200 --> 14:35.832
In under an hour, in ol' Marseille
we greet Japan's Defence Secretary.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.675
Mr... Tefu... Techumila.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.479
Mr. Tef... Tejus.
Just call him Nip!

14:42.640 --> 14:45.632
The Nip's from Tokyo.

14:45.800 --> 14:51.909
Before the Franco-Japanese summit
after Bastille Day in Paris...

14:52.080 --> 14:55.197
he's visiting our charming town. Known why?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.112
The climate?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.918
The sights?
- Sure.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.832
The food?
- The Pastis?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.718
The soccer match!

15:02.880 --> 15:05.758
You're a big bunch of nerds!

15:05.920 --> 15:09.230
Our anti-gang training base!

15:14.080 --> 15:18.437
The Japs have a problem
with the Jacuzzi... Yakuza...

15:18.600 --> 15:23.754
who are even kidnapping
members of the government.

15:23.920 --> 15:28.118
The Defence Secretary
visited England, Germany and France.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.918
Let's get one thing clear:

15:30.080 --> 15:34.153
the Krauts and the Limeys
mustn't win the contract.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.393
Let's make this World Cup II!

15:38.560 --> 15:43.793
I put together a detailed operation
which I will now explain.

15:43.960 --> 15:48.238
I called it Operation...

15:48.400 --> 15:49.753
Ninja!

15:54.760 --> 15:56.557
He's got no more ammo.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.280
Suddenly... no more ammo!

15:59.440 --> 16:02.079
Well, that's only natural.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.878
Yeah, only natural.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.157
I turn to Raymond. Here he is.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.152
I shake him.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.029
"Raymond, your ammo!" I say. No answer!

16:15.200 --> 16:17.316
I shake him again!

16:17.480 --> 16:20.153
Then...

16:20.320 --> 16:23.517
he falls sideways. Dead!

16:23.680 --> 16:25.557
Terrible!
- My whole unit!

16:25.720 --> 16:27.358
I’m alone.

16:27.520 --> 16:32.799
Armoured car's on fire, radio's out
and my flask's half-empty!

16:32.960 --> 16:35.076
Oh, no! So, then what?

16:35.240 --> 16:36.958
I prayed!
- Well done!

16:37.120 --> 16:41.318
That's all I could do.
Only a miracle could save me!

16:42.640 --> 16:45.029
A miracle! We're saved!

16:45.200 --> 16:48.192
Now what?

16:48.360 --> 16:51.955
Edmond, the red phone!

16:52.120 --> 16:55.476
The red phone? Excuse me.

16:57.840 --> 17:03.119
General Bertineau speaking.
It’s you, Bertrand on the red phone?

17:03.280 --> 17:05.919
Well done, Daniel. You'll get dessert!

17:06.079 --> 17:09.117
My God! I completely forgot!

17:09.280 --> 17:12.078
No problem! I’ll be there!

17:12.240 --> 17:13.638
Catastrophe!

17:13.800 --> 17:16.791
We'll wait.
- I’ll be 1 hour!

17:16.960 --> 17:20.474
I want you right now.
- Give me 20 seconds!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.278
The airport, fast!

17:22.440 --> 17:23.998
That's kinda long!

17:32.880 --> 17:34.438
Catastrophe!

17:36.280 --> 17:37.998
Dad!

17:38.160 --> 17:41.391
You OK? You hurt?

17:42.840 --> 17:44.193
Catastrophe!

17:48.840 --> 17:51.308
She won't go so good now!

17:51.480 --> 17:56.508
In 15 minutes I’m to greet Japan's
Defence Secretary. Catastrophe!

17:56.680 --> 18:01.231
I’ll get you there in time.
- Impossible!

18:02.360 --> 18:03.918
Try me, sir!

18:27.760 --> 18:30.320
Seatbelt, please, Dad.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.193
Is this your ambulance?
- No, a taxi.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.033
My brother loaned it to me.

18:38.080 --> 18:42.551
Save me some dessert.
- You can have seconds!

18:43.880 --> 18:46.678
Let's go.
- Sure!

19:22.120 --> 19:27.035
We're crawling 'cause of these tires,
but they'll soon warm up!

19:27.200 --> 19:28.599
Don't overheat!

19:58.720 --> 20:02.508
Now look, kid. This is the new Cortex 500.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.796
The Rolls Royce of speed traps!

20:06.040 --> 20:09.350
Turn it on. Instant read-out.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.553
Go to the roadside.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.397
Put your arm out slightly.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.551
You better learn on the old model.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.954
We're on the highway?
- Now I can step on it!

20:34.120 --> 20:36.111
You must like hospitals!

20:37.880 --> 20:39.233
Catastrophe!

20:47.360 --> 20:49.191
Chief! We got one!

20:49.360 --> 20:50.713
A biggie:

20:53.920 --> 20:55.273
306!

20:55.440 --> 20:59.513
I think it was a 406. And not factory-fresh!

20:59.680 --> 21:02.513
306 km/h, moron! Tell others!

21:04.200 --> 21:08.432
A white taxi at 306 km/h. I repeat 306 km/h!

21:08.600 --> 21:09.953
Yup, 306!

21:10.120 --> 21:12.076
We'll get him!

21:15.480 --> 21:17.232
You OK, sir?

21:23.160 --> 21:25.628
It’s him! I must get there!

21:25.800 --> 21:27.392
Change of tactics!

21:31.280 --> 21:33.032
What? This isn't it!

21:33.200 --> 21:34.838
It’s a short cut!

21:43.560 --> 21:44.913
Hold on!

22:03.720 --> 22:06.109
I have a UFO on Runway 1!

22:06.920 --> 22:08.797
Yield to aircraft.

22:10.320 --> 22:14.791
We have just landed.
Outside temperature: 95 degrees.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.714
We hope you enjoyed flying with us!

22:39.440 --> 22:43.115
Excuse me, Captain, a taxi's coming.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.794
I can't hear over the noise!

22:46.960 --> 22:49.713
I repeat: taxi approaching.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.440
I never ordered a taxi. Did you?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.318
No, but I know him.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.240
14 minutes 30 secons!

23:08.560 --> 23:08.958
Great!

23:15.800 --> 23:17.552
Bertineau, why the taxi?

23:17.720 --> 23:20.757
We lost a car. This guy saved my life.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.351
Con-ninny-a!

23:36.400 --> 23:38.231
What?
- What you said.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.753
God help me!

23:47.480 --> 23:48.959
Glad to be here.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.875
Thank you for greeting me in Japanese.

23:54.040 --> 23:58.113
Me, Gibert, protect you
during your vacation... uh, stay.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.192
Our Secretary. Say hi. This is he.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.952
Dear fellow!

24:09.320 --> 24:11.834
I’m honoured to meet you.

24:12.000 --> 24:18.473
I’m a member of your security team.
We wish you a nice stay.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.119
You speak very well.

24:20.280 --> 24:24.592
A little.
If I can help in any way, just ask.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.513
Pleased to meet you.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.272
Only the blonde girl speaks Japanese.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.472
I copy. Go back to base.

24:52.960 --> 24:57.351
Let us offer you a cocktail. This way.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.478
Does your file say you speak Japanese?

25:00.640 --> 25:03.234
Below my measurements.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.039
Guess I stopped there.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.031
Do me a favour, son. See that taxi there?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.553
I sure do!

25:21.080 --> 25:25.551
Love to, lady, but I’m busy. Another time?

25:29.640 --> 25:32.598
Always in the right place!
- Know that guy?

25:32.760 --> 25:35.149
Bertineau, head of the Med. Basin.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.753
Lilly's dad!
- No shit!

25:36.920 --> 25:38.797
I was there for lunch.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.316
Unbelievable!
- Yeah, I can't stand the army.

25:42.480 --> 25:47.270
You couldn't stand cops.
- I still can't. I can't stand you!

25:47.440 --> 25:49.431
Well, he seems to like you.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.990
He wants you to come to the cocktail party.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.277
Half cops, half soldiers?
That's a nightmare!

25:56.440 --> 26:00.479
Prefer half mechanics,
half gas station attendants?

26:00.640 --> 26:04.474
Come on. The chat's the same:
cars, sport, chicks!

26:04.640 --> 26:08.110
You'll fit in fine.
- I’d be ashamed.

26:08.280 --> 26:15.038
Listen. If Bertineau is Lilly's father,
he could end up your father-in-law.

26:15.200 --> 26:19.990
What will he think if you say no?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.116
One drink, no more.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.395
Martini?
- My sister's name!

26:34.560 --> 26:37.552
One for the road won't hurt you!

26:37.720 --> 26:40.393
Domo arigato.
- The gateau is good.

26:40.560 --> 26:45.315
Locally made. Next to the station.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.711
Excuse me. I’ll get you another.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.316
Don't get him too stewed
to sign the contract.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.392
No worries, I know what I’m doing.

26:55.560 --> 26:58.472
Just softening him up. He's nearly done!

26:58.640 --> 27:00.790
Is your plan ready?

27:01.960 --> 27:05.509
Sir, it's hearsed and rehearsed to death!

27:05.680 --> 27:09.036
It’s fine-turned to the second.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.957
You're not all as I imagined.

27:16.120 --> 27:21.114
No offence,
but a bright 2nd-year medical student...

27:21.280 --> 27:24.955
I thought you'd be more...

27:25.120 --> 27:29.033
Pimply?
- Right. And a slower driver!

27:29.200 --> 27:32.795
Yes, he's the "fastest" doctor I know.

27:32.960 --> 27:37.511
Well, I’m very grateful.
Gratefully indebted to you!

27:37.680 --> 27:40.877
Ask me anything, but Lilly's hand!

27:42.040 --> 27:45.635
'Course not! I can't think of anything else.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.792
Valid 1 year, parts and labour!

27:50.600 --> 27:53.398
Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.791
Emilien, start of Operation Ninja.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.918
Pétra, watch him.
- Watch me?

28:00.080 --> 28:04.039
Friends with cops?
- No, only with one.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.749
Good! It’s rare.
Most youths are anti-cops...

28:07.920 --> 28:12.277
anti-army, anti-everything!
They want to kill the father figure.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.273
Sir, my patients are waiting.

28:15.440 --> 28:20.468
Wait! 5 more minutes.
You'll find this very interesting.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.595
Selling the Japs Peugeot?
- Nothing's impossible!

28:43.760 --> 28:45.671
This is the Cobra.

28:45.840 --> 28:50.231
Specially designed
to protect visiting dignitaries.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.038
Titanium bodywork.

28:52.200 --> 28:56.034
The multiple side panels
can resist any bullet!

28:56.200 --> 28:58.589
Missile detectors, front and back!

28:58.760 --> 29:02.116
Coating: Phantom! Solid tires!

29:02.280 --> 29:05.158
It’s linked to the Atlas satellite...

29:05.320 --> 29:09.438
and if necessary, can be piloted from HQ.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.033
Now, the engine.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.833
Ninja!

29:18.320 --> 29:20.151
Nice noise for a V12.

29:20.320 --> 29:24.393
V12 engine, twin turbos. Voice-activated!

29:24.560 --> 29:27.028
Top speed: 320 km/h!

29:27.200 --> 29:31.193
Range: 900 km. From Paris to Marseille.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.875
2 airbags in front, 2 in back,
4 at the sides.

29:35.040 --> 29:39.636
8 in all for maximum protection.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.873
Ladies and gentleman,
this car is like France:

29:44.040 --> 29:45.598
indestructible!

29:49.120 --> 29:52.396
That's just 'cause we set it
to ultra-sensitive.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.836
It’s usually on normal!

29:58.120 --> 29:59.917
See the balloons?

30:00.080 --> 30:02.548
Useful against thieves!

30:02.720 --> 30:04.676
Get him out!

30:06.880 --> 30:09.792
Tell him not to worry.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.471
He needs the bathroom.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.234
Bertrand, go with him.
- Yes, sir.

30:18.480 --> 30:22.234
It'll be good as new in no time.

30:24.600 --> 30:28.229
Will he? Now who'll drive it?

30:28.400 --> 30:34.635
Sir, I have a young civilian driver.
He's very good. I’ll vouch for him.

30:36.680 --> 30:36.918
Banco!

30:39.480 --> 30:47.239
Before your tour of the town, I’ll show
you our latest computing innovation.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.432
Gimme that!

30:55.640 --> 30:57.995
Wear this.
- It’ll cramp my style.

30:58.160 --> 31:02.039
Even a cretin with mitts on
could drive this baby!

31:02.200 --> 31:05.192
Take him away!
- No, it's OK.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.348
Told you!
- Never mind. No one'll see.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.829
Go on! Ninja!

31:15.880 --> 31:20.158
How do you stop it?
- You just have to say "Nip".

31:21.320 --> 31:22.673
Ninja!

31:22.840 --> 31:28.631
The mission's simple. We prepared
a demonstration. With fake attacks!

31:28.800 --> 31:33.828
Like the ghost train?
- Yes, so as to impress the Nip.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.157
Above all, don't worry. Let things happen.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.072
If the Nip...

31:42.400 --> 31:47.474
Don't play while I’m talking.
- You keep saying "Nip"!

31:48.560 --> 31:50.551
Great!
- Not bad.

31:51.640 --> 31:55.952
Sir, we shall now escort you to your hotel.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.076
Get in!

32:02.920 --> 32:04.512
Up shit creek again!

32:15.280 --> 32:16.998
Forward!

32:44.360 --> 32:45.713
They're here.

32:47.520 --> 32:50.512
On this road. It’s going as planned.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.036
Very good, Katano. Let me hear them.

32:58.960 --> 33:03.670
Spring Roll, come in.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.793
Hey, Emilien, come in!

33:07.960 --> 33:10.713
Do you read me?
- Loud 'n' clear.

33:10.880 --> 33:15.635
We just left for the 1st trap.
Be with you in 20 minutes.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.031
OK, 20 minutes to warm up.

33:21.520 --> 33:25.229
What about us?
What can we do for about 20 minutes?

33:25.400 --> 33:27.755
I don't know. Any ideas?

33:27.920 --> 33:31.196
Yeah, but 20 centim... minutes is too short!

33:31.360 --> 33:37.230
Oh yeah? So, we need an idea
we could start now and finish later.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.039
Yes, that would work!

33:40.200 --> 33:43.636
But... I too have an idea.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.997
I’m sure you'll really like it.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.390
Oh yeah? It may be the same one.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.755
That'd be marvellous!

33:51.920 --> 33:56.550
It'd be ideal! Go on, you first.

33:58.720 --> 34:04.670
Make the most of these few quiet moments...

34:04.840 --> 34:06.478
to learn Japanese!

34:06.640 --> 34:09.074
It wasn't the same idea.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.998
He won't see much of Marseille.

34:16.159 --> 34:19.789
Sorry, he's suffering from jetlag.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.713
May I ask why your boss is here?

34:22.880 --> 34:27.351
To sign very big contract
and see anti-gang method.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.478
He'll sure see that!
- You know method?

34:30.639 --> 34:35.509
Sure I do!
1st, the suspect. He's probably guilty.

34:35.679 --> 34:38.114
A foreigner is doubly suspect!

34:38.280 --> 34:43.831
Then there's the guilty,
foreign, tanned suspect! He's had it!

34:44.000 --> 34:49.393
If he's tanned, he just sun-bathes and
does nothing all day, he's a suspect!

34:49.560 --> 34:51.835
So, he's guilty. Faultless logic!

34:52.000 --> 34:53.558
That boy any good?

34:53.719 --> 34:58.635
Very good. A young doctor,
friend of my daughter's.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.836
Something tells me they're flirting.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.309
Only natural at their age.
- Quite.

35:03.480 --> 35:08.156
To make the guilty party confess,
they use questioning!

35:08.320 --> 35:11.517
Simple! They apply a trilogy like Star Wars.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.671
Episode 1: Beat him up!

35:13.840 --> 35:15.831
Good, healthy exercise!

35:16.000 --> 35:20.596
Episode 2: Tax 'em to raise
some cash for the Christmas party!

35:20.760 --> 35:23.479
Episode 3: Drink copiously!

35:23.640 --> 35:28.509
I’m pleased some youngsters
still respect our values.

35:28.680 --> 35:31.069
A good son-in-law.
- Think so?

35:31.240 --> 35:32.958
Many French gangs?

35:33.120 --> 35:36.908
The most dangerous are
the heavy mob: 100,000 - strong!

35:37.080 --> 35:40.356
Easy to spot: Always guzzling beer!

35:43.800 --> 35:47.156
Go toward the port.
- My pleasure, chief.

35:47.320 --> 35:51.279
He sounds very polite.
- Affirmative. Courteous, too.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.915
Polite to your face, shaft you from behind!

35:56.080 --> 36:00.551
Like in the souk.
A big smile as they steal your cash!

36:00.720 --> 36:03.314
But I’ve got my eye on him.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.113
Tell me something.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.829
I’ve not been in the police long,
but try me.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.278
What means the word
your captain uses: "Nip"?

36:19.680 --> 36:22.478
Why'd he stop? I said to beware!

36:22.640 --> 36:24.039
What's going on?

36:24.200 --> 36:28.113
Just a simultaneous translation problem!

36:31.760 --> 36:35.833
Cut the crap.
We're at the meeting point in... now.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.559
Don't worry!

36:57.720 --> 36:59.073
General alert.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.035
Shit! There's a missile pointing at me.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.872
Missile? What missile?

37:27.480 --> 37:30.597
Atlas: Real-time missile diversion.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.832
Unique! The Limeys won't get the ball!

37:34.000 --> 37:36.798
Impressive, but where's it headed?

37:36.960 --> 37:40.714
Don't worry. Somewhere far out at sea.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.473
Shit, my boat!

38:04.600 --> 38:06.431
The high point of our show.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.993
Impressive!

38:16.120 --> 38:18.156
Very good work, Gibert.

38:18.320 --> 38:24.634
Thank you, sir, I’m so pleased to be
able to try out this equipment at last.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.553
Roadhog!

38:37.720 --> 38:39.915
OK, the coast is clear.

38:45.400 --> 38:50.918
Impressive
- You get used to it. A regular day.

39:03.480 --> 39:07.393
Your moves are improving,
but not your accent.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.909
Spring Roll! Copy?

39:11.080 --> 39:14.516
Just fine. Did you make it.
I mean, are you here?

39:14.680 --> 39:18.116
1st attack completed. Be with you in 5.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.872
Ready?

39:20.040 --> 39:25.512
Pétra and I were checking
a few things out. A-OK.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.319
Emilien, Gibert here.

39:28.480 --> 39:29.833
I’m counting on you.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.711
You can count on me, Pétra.
I mean: you can count on Pétra!

39:35.880 --> 39:37.313
Count on Pétra!

39:40.720 --> 39:42.073
Go!

40:06.000 --> 40:07.991
Dammit, I told you to warm up!

40:08.160 --> 40:09.513
We're hot!

40:09.680 --> 40:15.073
Gibert will kill you guys! Go warm up!

40:15.240 --> 40:18.789
Just off to the little girls' room.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.878
I’ll go with you. You never know.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.957
Can't you read? It says "Green light"!

40:42.120 --> 40:44.714
Get a move on, you fag!

40:44.880 --> 40:46.233
Oh shit!

41:01.880 --> 41:04.872
Now turn left. I repeat left.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.679
Yes, chief. I repeat, chief!

41:11.160 --> 41:14.470
He says you drive well.
- I’m not moving!

41:14.640 --> 41:19.794
It freaks me out
not to hear the engine speak to me.

41:25.600 --> 41:28.876
Putting in earplugs? Do I talk too much?

41:29.040 --> 41:32.396
Nein! It’s a miniature ear transmitter.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.120
Brand-new! I’m on channel 1.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.078
But how do we talk?

41:38.240 --> 41:43.917
I know you French can't handle it,
but an order isn't to be discussed!

41:44.080 --> 41:49.029
Yeah, but if you have a problem
what do I do?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.358
Can you hear me?

41:57.160 --> 41:59.799
1 bang means yes, 2 means no!

42:02.960 --> 42:05.110
Mind if we keep chatting?

42:06.680 --> 42:13.313
That's good, 'cause the closed door
makes it easier to talk to you.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.316
I don't dare to say things to your face.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.716
Your eyes trouble me. They're so...

42:26.880 --> 42:28.438
so blue!

42:30.280 --> 42:32.953
What's Spring Roll up to?
- What?

42:33.120 --> 42:37.193
It’s in code.
I just can't find the translation.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.794
When your eyes look at me... wow!

42:39.960 --> 42:42.394
It’s a 1st, or I had my back turned.

42:43.560 --> 42:47.951
Part of method?
- You bet! Daniel's method!

42:49.160 --> 42:53.597
It’s good to open my heart to you.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.716
You don't mind too much?

43:03.000 --> 43:04.831
Should I go on, then?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.353
I don't get it!

43:06.520 --> 43:11.640
Have you noticed
that I’m much closer to you now?

43:13.600 --> 43:14.953
"No"?

43:20.040 --> 43:21.598
Good!

43:23.360 --> 43:29.356
OK, Pétra, I’ll say something
you may find shocking. Here goes.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.238
He'll screw up!

43:31.400 --> 43:36.190
Well, since Day One, I’ve known I love you!

43:38.800 --> 43:40.711
Well played!
- Told you!

43:40.880 --> 43:42.393
There, I said it!

43:42.560 --> 43:46.917
Now put me out of my misery: Is it mutual?

43:47.080 --> 43:48.638
So, uh...

43:50.040 --> 43:54.033
1 bang: yes, 2 means no.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.470
Change channels to talk dirty!
We're working!

44:01.040 --> 44:03.315
Left here, kid.
- Yes, pops!

44:13.440 --> 44:15.032
He's not one of us.

44:25.360 --> 44:28.796
That's for sure. He's not one of us.

44:46.720 --> 44:49.996
What're you playing at? Go on! Ninja!

44:50.160 --> 44:53.118
Sorry to be so down: I smell a trap.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.637
Smell a trap?
I don't smell a thing. Do you, sir?

45:00.800 --> 45:06.397
Strange how those trucks are parked.
Just room for 1 car!

45:07.600 --> 45:11.878
No, there's no trap.
I checked the map. No trap here.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.679
Drive on!
- If you say so.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.513
I should know.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.630
Well, I never! A trap!

45:31.040 --> 45:32.473
What's he up to?

45:46.680 --> 45:48.033
What page?

46:00.960 --> 46:03.633
That's not on my list.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.753
Hats off!

46:15.760 --> 46:17.830
Shit! Glad it's not my taxi!

46:32.240 --> 46:34.674
What happened? Where's the Nip?

46:34.840 --> 46:38.719
Some Ninjas... came, and the Secretary went.

46:38.880 --> 46:41.269
What? He didn't fly away?

46:41.440 --> 46:47.037
He did! At that speed,
he must be on his way to Mars!

46:47.200 --> 46:51.512
Ask Atlas. It must've spotted him!

46:51.680 --> 46:54.274
General alert!

46:55.400 --> 46:56.992
Stop! Police!

47:49.360 --> 47:50.713
Shit!

48:24.680 --> 48:27.399
Complex town, huh? Small streets!

48:27.560 --> 48:29.790
The jails are no bigger!

48:29.960 --> 48:35.512
Lie down there!
I’m crack shot, so no tricks!

48:35.680 --> 48:37.671
You speak French?

48:37.840 --> 48:39.910
Me warn you: me shoot!

48:40.080 --> 48:41.433
Spread out!

48:57.640 --> 49:01.155
Is that how you wanna play it? All right!

49:09.120 --> 49:13.557
Now where are they?
They didn't fly away, too?

49:13.720 --> 49:16.029
Where's Emilien? Emilien!

49:17.680 --> 49:20.797
I reckon he's near the garbage.

49:20.960 --> 49:24.794
I was this close to getting 'em,
but I was outnumbered.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.235
They took the Secretary!
- Which one?

49:27.400 --> 49:30.597
The Nip, not ours. It’s a disaster!

49:30.760 --> 49:33.149
Yeah, and they got Pétra, too.

49:33.320 --> 49:37.791
Good. She speaks Japanese,
so he'll be less alone.

50:04.720 --> 50:08.156
Lilly, I’m coming. Your dad made me stay!

50:08.320 --> 50:12.632
But it's been 2 hours. I’m hot all over.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.633
All over?
- Yeah, all over!

50:15.800 --> 50:17.756
I’ll be on fire soon.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.435
I’m coming. Watch a documentary -
it'll calm you down!

50:21.600 --> 50:24.512
I’ll be 5 minutes.
- Too long!

50:24.680 --> 50:26.033
4 minutes!

50:37.760 --> 50:41.799
It’s my fault for leaving her in the john!

50:41.960 --> 50:47.432
You shoulda gone with her.
- I thought of that. I did. But...

50:48.640 --> 50:51.313
Finished scratching about yet?

50:51.480 --> 50:55.314
There were indeed cars here. 3 of them.

50:55.480 --> 50:59.234
You read Sherlock Holmes to deduce that?

50:59.400 --> 51:02.278
Don't you have any clues to get us started?

51:02.440 --> 51:07.594
We'll analyze the tire samples
at the lab. That'll tell us more.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.797
They'll have time to swim back to Tokyo!

51:15.640 --> 51:19.428
Thanks for everything,
but I need my taxi now.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.113
Want your convertible?

51:21.280 --> 51:25.239
We're in shit!
These clowns are shaving the road!

51:25.400 --> 51:27.152
Please help us find a clue.

51:27.320 --> 51:31.233
Look, Lilly's on fire.
She might burn herself.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.995
They got my girl.
Give me 2 minutes of your time.

51:35.160 --> 51:38.630
Take a look, then I’ll handle it.

51:43.680 --> 51:47.434
From below, I saw 3 black Mitsubishis.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.158
A new model.

51:50.600 --> 51:53.194
Tires straight from Japan.
- How d'you know?

51:53.360 --> 51:55.351
Smell it.
- Fish.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.988
Meaning?
- A restaurant?

51:58.160 --> 52:01.948
You got fish oil for brains?
Restaurants and ports!

52:02.120 --> 52:07.353
They were on a boat from Japan!
- So, that's why they smell of fish!

52:07.520 --> 52:10.830
See? Now, are they stolen cars?
- Easy!

52:11.000 --> 52:13.434
Alain!
- I’m onto it.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.398
OK, you put your tweezers down.

52:16.560 --> 52:22.829
On Monday morning, you'll get a whistle
and be put on traffic duty!

52:23.960 --> 52:25.313
Idiots!

52:25.480 --> 52:28.153
Nothing stolen from the port.

52:28.320 --> 52:32.791
Bingo!
- What? It just means you were wrong.

52:32.960 --> 52:36.555
Why wasn't the theft declared?

52:36.720 --> 52:39.917
'Cause they use the warehouse as a base!

52:40.080 --> 52:42.230
You can be real smart!

52:42.400 --> 52:47.633
General alert!
- No, Emilien. That's always my line.

52:47.800 --> 52:50.519
Explain it to me once more.

52:53.560 --> 52:56.028
I’m on my way! You watching TV?

52:56.200 --> 53:01.035
No, I stopped. There was a report
on animal sex. I burned the rug!

53:01.200 --> 53:02.872
Lilly's worried.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.393
Give me that.

53:04.560 --> 53:09.111
Tell your mom it's OK,
but I need to commandeer your friend.

53:09.280 --> 53:11.748
He did a great job. Good recruit.

53:11.920 --> 53:16.914
He'll bring me home.
You can say goodnight then. Bye, hon.

53:17.080 --> 53:20.755
C'mon, let's go. The mission's not over.

54:01.440 --> 54:04.000
What's Gibert up to?

54:04.160 --> 54:10.235
I dunno. He's been in the john for ages,
making weird noises.

54:26.160 --> 54:30.312
What's up?
- I can't tell you. It’s... too horrible!

54:43.240 --> 54:46.869
They won't come.
- What?

54:47.040 --> 54:53.479
I think this was their 1st base.
They're gone. Long gone.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.397
Suspect approaching. Asian male.

55:10.560 --> 55:16.351
They always return to the crime scene!
Police Academy, lesson 1! Positions!

55:18.840 --> 55:20.193
Captain?

55:21.040 --> 55:24.032
Suspects approaching front door.

55:24.200 --> 55:25.553
Perfect!

55:27.600 --> 55:29.272
I’m ready for 'em!

55:40.840 --> 55:44.276
Hey, you sure about this?

55:44.440 --> 55:47.113
What? It’s the heist of the century!

55:47.280 --> 55:51.319
There's a mountain of VCRs,
boxed and awaiting delivery!

55:51.480 --> 55:53.596
They're about to break in.

55:53.760 --> 55:57.673
We got 'em!
- Emilien! You break in to your home?

55:57.840 --> 55:59.398
Sure.
- Oh yeah?

55:59.560 --> 56:00.913
Well, no.

56:04.280 --> 56:07.636
Uh-oh! Chief, are you gonna...?

56:08.800 --> 56:13.874
I like to stay close to my men.
Some action won't hurt me.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.918
Just like in the old days!

56:17.080 --> 56:21.358
It was long ago.
- The memory is distant.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.431
But the reflexes...

56:25.000 --> 56:26.797
are still intact!

56:28.560 --> 56:31.074
Believe me. Thanks!

56:37.360 --> 56:41.558
Sure there's no cops?
- Relax, dammit! There's no one here!

56:41.720 --> 56:46.510
They're all watching the game.
Every cop's in front of a TV.

56:46.680 --> 56:49.592
Ready to attack? Wait for my signal.

56:54.720 --> 56:57.154
You worry me. It’s a long way down.

56:57.320 --> 57:00.471
It’s OK. Tie the knot. I’ll do the rest.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.437
Uh-oh.

57:04.520 --> 57:08.195
See? They're all at the match, like I said!

57:11.240 --> 57:12.958
Attack!

57:19.480 --> 57:21.994
Shit!

57:22.160 --> 57:24.879
Emilien?
- OK, chief.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.349
Bonzai!

57:28.720 --> 57:30.392
Someone being knifed?

57:36.800 --> 57:39.872
The knot's all right.
- Yeah.

57:42.400 --> 57:43.833
Maybe the rope.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.798
You got the wrong one.
- You're right.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.313
Ambulance! Now!

58:06.920 --> 58:10.310
I should never have left her
or let him down.

58:10.480 --> 58:16.669
That's enough crying over spilled milk.
It won't bring her back. Think!

58:16.840 --> 58:20.435
I am! But we don't have
a single lead to go on!

58:20.600 --> 58:22.431
Ask the right questions.

58:22.600 --> 58:26.798
Why didn't the Yakuza kill him at once?
- They need him?

58:26.960 --> 58:30.236
Why? Did they ask for a ransom?
- No.

58:30.400 --> 58:35.520
Why kidnap him here?
They must have had a good reason.

58:35.680 --> 58:37.557
Why's he going to Paris?

58:37.720 --> 58:43.113
To sign contracts.
Security, trains, army, nuclear.

58:43.280 --> 58:48.354
There! Maybe they want to stop him.
-Makes no sense. Why do that?

58:48.520 --> 58:52.035
He's right. Yuki Tsumoto wants to stop him.

58:52.200 --> 58:56.239
I know you.
Weren't you an air hostess before?

58:56.400 --> 59:01.155
I’m here to protect the Secretary.
I’m in counter-espionage.

59:01.320 --> 59:05.438
Funny! I too am. I’m in counter-espionage.

59:05.600 --> 59:09.354
That's Daniel.
- Intern. I’m learning to be stupid!

59:09.520 --> 59:12.398
Clever! Who's this Yuki Tsumoto?

59:12.560 --> 59:16.678
Yakuza. Controls the north.
Powerful and conservative.

59:16.840 --> 59:20.276
Refuses airplanes, trains, nuclear power.

59:20.440 --> 59:23.716
As France is keen to sell,
he's taking steps.

59:23.880 --> 59:27.759
The Secretary won't sign,
nor will Japan ever again!

59:27.920 --> 59:31.356
Tsumoto sent over 2 masters in hypnosis.

59:31.520 --> 59:36.548
The Secretary, when the time is right
will shoot someone.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.995
Perhaps the President.

59:39.160 --> 59:42.869
France will sever
all diplomatic ties for years?

59:43.040 --> 59:44.598
Exactly.
- Crazy!

59:44.760 --> 59:48.833
We must free your friend
and the Secretary before 11.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.790
I better tell my boss.
- The cripple or Sleeping Beauty?

59:53.960 --> 59:57.350
Listen. You both got someone to save.

59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.275
As we're in a rush, we better
not disturb the powers that be.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.158
No?
- Right!

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:07.949
No Nip'll beat us! Pardon me!
Where do we start?

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.874
First, can you find them in Paris?
- No way!

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.029
Easy! Child's play!

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.075
Thanks, Joe. You saved my life!
See you soon, pal.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.118
They're hiding out in southern Paris.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.475
Sure it's her? Uh, them!

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.918
3 black Mitsubishis with a blonde. OK?

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:59.232
To the airport!
- No plane for 3 hours.

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.634
We can't wait. We must get there right away!

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.916
Get up! It’s war!

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.232
Men!
- It’s me, Daniel!

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.796
The troops?
- Wiped out! Just us to save the day.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.315
You're indebted to me.
- Affirmative!

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.232
I need your help.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.670
Shit! What 're they up to?

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.271
Cool, pal! Way to go!

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.514
I really hope you know
what you're doing, 'cause I don't!

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.399
Got a better idea?
- Right now? No.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.312
Well, think fast!

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.998
I got it! Let me out.
- Too late!

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.952
Are you cool?

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.350
You bet! Cool as ice!

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.033
Just shout, OK?

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.313
OK, I’m shouting! We lost a parachute!

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.631
There are 3. 1 or 2 always screw up!

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.153
Oh, right!

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.118
Got your license?
- Yes.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.111
So, take over here.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.032
C'mon, move!

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.960
I’ll steer us.
- Where do I go?

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.872
Straight ahead.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.235
Straight ahead? OK!

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.512
Come on, just relax. Be more zen.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.120
That's good. Real good.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.075
Oh Lilly, you OK?

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.233
Who's the warbler?
- Air hostess.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.753
No, a nurse!

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.071
You in a massage parlour?
- No way, Lilly!

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.152
We're in the sky. Your dad's guiding us.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.993
Emilien's steering,
I’m fixing a parachute...

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.152
the nurse is singing to calm us down!

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.072
You smoke a tree?!

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.915
I’m trying to save
Pétra and Japan's Secretary!

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.548
I’ll call you when we land!

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.073
Goddammit!

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.909
You OK, hon?
- Just fine!

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.798
What a doubter!

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.948
Try to turn left a bit.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.829
Now, turn left. I repeat, left.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.833
Hi there!

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.593
It’s OK! Stay calm! Marseille Police!

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.113
Move!

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.959
You know them?
- Yeah.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.352
An old pupil. Well, I’ll walk home.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.154
OK, Lionel?
- Jacques, Mr. Coutta.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.673
Hello there.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.711
All set, Coutta?
- Just Japan's Secretary to come.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.798
I see her.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.430
God, she's lovely! I mean, she looks well.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.309
The Secretary?
- Fine. He's exercising.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:59.230
Maybe we should get 'em back.
- But we must warn your friend.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.038
It won't be easy.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.918
What a jerk I am!
- Really?

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.072
Her earphone!

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.040
Are you ready to kill?

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.356
You hear me?

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.114
We're not far away.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.318
Get up...

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.473
and turn around.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:34.033
Show me your hands.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.717
What's going on?
- It’s not me.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.155
You suck!
- So do you!

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.151
Sit down. We're coming.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.039
Easy to say!
- I got a plan.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.997
That's what worries me!

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.469
You hear only what I tell you.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.916
Only what I tell you.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.876
You obey me.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.350
You do only what I tell you.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.591
I wanna go home!

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:26.869
'Cause it's cold and I’m getting sick.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:32.670
You're going to sleep.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.356
Raise your arms.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.833
Hey, it's my turn now! Come on!

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.560
I’m not bad at hypnosis!

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.109
Sit! Good!

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.319
Now lie down! Very, very good!

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.675
Now sleep!

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.512
Freeze or you'll sleep, too!

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.830
OK, I’ll cover you.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.192
Hey, girls, what're you doing?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.149
No need. I had 'em covered.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.912
It’s not loaded.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.229
What's that?

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:09.957
How come?

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.158
It was me. I emptied the clip yesterday.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:20.438
So... it was never loaded?

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.988
So you wouldn't get hurt.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:48.158
I’m late. Help me out!

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:53.908
It’s OK, I’ll manage.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.713
Jump in there!

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.916
Are you sure?

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.911
I don't wanna fall down!

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.631
Catch those clowns!

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.471
Fancy some sushi?

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.073
No exit, Daniel!

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.431
Nips closing in!

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.193
One less!

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.469
We'll get out here.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.030
We're too heavy. They're good!

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.839
Ask your colleagues to help out.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.798
Forget it. Paris Police hate us.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.679
You just never asked 'em politely!

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.193
What the... ?

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.794
You faggots not at the parade?

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:33.239
Soldiers ain't your thing? You'd rather
stay home and gobble knobs?

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.039
How 'bout a love parade?

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.156
Catch me if you can!

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.078
You went a bit far!
- Don't worry! They love it!

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.358
Catch him alive! I’ll kill him myself!

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.910
Where are you?

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.398
Where's Trocadero?

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.437
Change at Chatelet!

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.192
A bus!

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.236
Oh, the Eiffel Tower!

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.236
Off the grass!

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.193
Straight on!

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.713
OK!

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.350
There's one!

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.078
Get the taxi!

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.272
Kamikaze!
- Kami what?

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.994
I can't shake 'em! We're too heavy!

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.276
I’ll get out!
- No, try again!

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.793
I can't!

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.954
Call the General.
- General!

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.078
Loud 'n clear! How's your tour going?

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.639
Whizzing by!

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.715
He's gotta block the Dauphine tunnel.
We'll trap 'em!

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.518
Give me 5 minutes.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.196
Picard? Bertineau here.
- Sir!

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.956
Got a spare tank or two?
- Sure I have.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.391
He better hurry up!

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.833
We're there. What's he up to?

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:46.519
OK, sir, the tunnel is blocked.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.033
4 mins. 32 secs.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.509
Well done, sir.
- Hang on!

01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.075
I don't wanna play!
- You wanna get shot down?

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.356
I don't wanna hit a tank!

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.797
I wanna spend time with Pétra before I die!

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.872
I’m taking you to Heaven!

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.677
I wanna stay here on Earth!

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:51.474
Learn to drive, you moron!

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.432
You scared me again!

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.592
Maybe one day you'll trust me!

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.349
You're wonderful. Be his driver in Japan.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:11.469
Thanks, but right now,
I just want to go home.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.871
Yeah, we're going home.
Want dropping off somewhere?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.353
Not the TV!

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.149
Just 5 minutes. I want to see your father.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.437
It looks like Daniel's taxi!

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:02.717
Well, that's brand-new. A stealth taxi.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.876
I’ll drop you at the grandstand.
This place freaks me out.
