(thunder rumbling)

00:15.215 --> 00:18.417
(phone ringing)

00:21.022 --> 00:25.724
Would you mind, um, picking me
up a veggie burger from rj's

00:25.726 --> 00:27.192
On your way back?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.061
I guess. They do have
a drive-through.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.195
Brody:
Hey, it's morgan.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.530
Uh, mind picking up me

00:31.532 --> 00:34.133
A veggie burger, too,
and finn a grilled cheese?

00:34.135 --> 00:35.768
All right, but you ladies
are gonna owe me.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.302
Thanks.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.505
Woman: <i>The national</i>
<i>weather service has issued</i>

00:39.507 --> 00:41.573
<i>A flash flood warning</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:44.043
For the city of las vegas
and outlying areas.

00:44.045 --> 00:47.179
Winds are expected to reach
50 miles per hour.

00:47.181 --> 00:50.249
The clark county regional flood
control center is keeping

00:50.251 --> 00:52.251
A close watch
on the storm basins...

00:52.253 --> 00:54.586
(groans)
it is nasty out there.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.221
Can't argue with that.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.291
Maybe we shouldn't have sent
greg to get our food.

00:59.293 --> 01:01.060
No, he's a...
He's a great swimmer.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.261
Andrews:
Wait, greg's on a chow run?

01:02.263 --> 01:03.295
I could really use some soup.

01:03.297 --> 01:07.332
Yeah, actually you guys are
gonna have to fend for yourself

01:07.334 --> 01:09.134
Out of the
refrigerator tonight.
Uh, yeah.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.335
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.172
All right, all
right, listen up...

01:14.507 --> 01:16.175
Wow.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.344
P.D. Just pulled a man
out of a flood channel

01:19.346 --> 01:21.713
With a suspicious head injury;
we need to process him.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.382
Treat it like a crime
until we know otherwise.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.217
Who's up next?
That'd be me.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.352
(clears throat)
sorry.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.254
Thank you.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.858
Got a male, early 30s, severe
hypothermia and head injuries.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.326
Okay, take him
to room three.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.794
This your guy
from the flood channel?

01:35.796 --> 01:38.163
Yeah, he's lucky his bag
got stuck on a tree limb.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.498
Kept him from washing
further downstream.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.700
Doctor, we need you
in room three, stat!

01:41.702 --> 01:43.869
Agonal respirations
on contact.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.338
Weak brachial pulse,
unable to get a bp.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.240
On three. One, two, three.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.541
Nurse:
Glucose is 50 mg.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.443
Any I.D. On him?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.711
If there is, it'll be in there.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.814
Blood pressure is 85/50.
I'll get him on the monitor.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.117
Emt: There wasn't any
obvious swelling to the head.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.419
Doctor: Make sure
we get a core temperature.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.620
Let's start by warming him.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.455
Then we'll address
the head wound.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.258
G-guys?

02:06.260 --> 02:09.194
Back out of here slowly
and take him with you.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.462
What is it?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.297
Bomb!

02:12.632 --> 02:13.799
And it's armed.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.234
It's a bomb.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.531

03:29.210 --> 03:32.578
Just willed myself
not to sneeze.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.213
Almost blew us both up.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.747
Keep up the

03:35.749 --> 03:37.282
I wasn't kidding.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.920
Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.755
I'm gonna slide my hands

03:43.757 --> 03:45.424
Underneath that satchel.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.492
I'm taking the weight
off your arms.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.761
Now, it's crucial
that you don't do anything

03:49.763 --> 03:53.232
Until I tell you, okay?

03:53.234 --> 03:56.235
I'm not about

You're doing great, sara.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.580
Okay.

04:08.582 --> 04:12.351
I'm sliding my hands
under the satchel.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.856
Okay?

04:17.858 --> 04:20.259
Now... Slowly
drop your arms

04:20.261 --> 04:22.794
Six inches

Come back to me.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.568
It's okay.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.969
Now...

04:30.971 --> 04:32.804
With your arms
in that position,

04:32.806 --> 04:35.807
Slowly walk directly back

05:21.355 --> 05:22.688
I'm gonna need those bomb parts.

Copy that.

You'll get whatever's left.

You've been served.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.511
Have a nice night.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.753
Some guy just served me
with papers.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.921
Csi three greg sanders,

06:29.923 --> 06:31.957
Meet defense criminalist
jennifer rhodes.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.759
Ms. Rhodes is here

06:33.761 --> 06:38.430
To review the evidence
on   <i>people v. Gus ellis</i>2006.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.866
Yeah, that, uh,
doesn't ring a bell.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.135
Ms. Rhodes,
wh-why don't you give us

06:43.137 --> 06:46.405
The    <i>reader's digest</i>
<i>version.</i>

06:46.407 --> 06:50.041
Gus ellis served seven years
of a life sentence

06:50.043 --> 06:52.844
For the rape/murder of
college student claire gibson.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.448
Since his case
hinged on dna,

06:56.450 --> 06:58.049
It fit the innocence project's
protocol.

06:58.051 --> 07:02.687
We extracted touch dna from
her jeans and her underwear,

07:02.689 --> 07:07.125
Which matched that of serial
sex offender clyde maroni.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.494
Testing wasn't sensitive enough
for touch dna back in 2006.

07:09.496 --> 07:13.865
Maroni confessed
and pled to a life sentence.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.435
Now gus ellis is free
and wants answers.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.537
I've been hired
by his civil attorney

07:18.539 --> 07:19.938
To see the case through.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.675
So, if science
proved his innocence

07:23.677 --> 07:25.510
Through new and
improved technology,

07:25.512 --> 07:27.446
What's the basis
for the lawsuit?

07:27.448 --> 07:30.449
Well, a week before her murder,

07:30.451 --> 07:33.518
Claire gibson called the police
complaining that a man

07:33.520 --> 07:35.921
Was looking at her
through her bedroom window.

07:35.923 --> 07:39.224
Gus ellis was identified
as the peeper.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.460
I remember that.
He was also

07:41.462 --> 07:44.830
The one who called 911
from the gibson murder scene.

07:44.832 --> 07:48.066
<i>He said that he looked</i>
<i>through the victim's window,</i>

07:48.068 --> 07:49.167
<i>Saw her lying there,</i>

07:49.169 --> 07:51.736
<i>And claimed</i>
<i>she was already dead.</i>

07:51.738 --> 07:54.706
He was arrested that same day,
which we call...

07:54.708 --> 07:57.008
A rush to judgment.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.513
He was <i>the</i> person
of interest

08:01.515 --> 08:04.549
In an investigation
started by the victim.

08:04.551 --> 08:08.086
A week later, he calls 911
from her murder scene.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.255
No prints, no semen,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.557
No evidence linked mr. Ellis
to the inside of that...

08:12.559 --> 08:14.092
I-I remember that
there was a crowbar

08:14.094 --> 08:16.561
Next to her with
his blood on it.

08:16.563 --> 08:20.198
Mr. Ellis stated that he never
went inside that house

08:20.200 --> 08:21.666
And he never touched
that crowbar.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.502
Russell:
He claims only way his blood

08:23.504 --> 08:26.505
Was on that crowbar
is if it were planted.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.672
What?!

08:27.674 --> 08:29.975
He's saying that I
planted his blood?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.576
How?

08:31.578 --> 08:33.578
A reference blood sample
was collected from mr. Ellis,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.248
A blood sample
that you received at the scene.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.849
(knocking)

08:37.851 --> 08:41.186
Finlay's gonna be working
with ms. Rhodes

08:41.188 --> 08:42.687
On the re-examination.

08:42.689 --> 08:46.091
Until they're finished,
I need you on desk duty.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.292
(thunder rumbling)

08:56.569 --> 08:59.604
(monitor beeping steadily)

09:01.941 --> 09:04.576
He's still out.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.744
How you doing, sara?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.712
I'm a little shaky.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.015
Nothing like staring into
the abyss for 20 minutes

09:10.017 --> 09:12.217
To decide what's important
in life.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.686
It's sad how it takes
something so...

09:14.688 --> 09:18.056
Intense to make us stop
and smell the coffee, huh?

09:18.058 --> 09:21.560
Bomb guys disrupted the device
to render it safe.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.328
I sent what was left
to hodges.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.597
Well, police officers are
walking the flood channel.

09:25.599 --> 09:28.199
It would be good to know
how long he was in there.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.869
It only takes ten minutes in 50
degree water to get hypothermia,

09:30.871 --> 09:32.604
But he could've been
in there longer than that.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.139
He got hung up on a tree branch.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.707
We need to quickly I.D. Him
and find out

09:35.709 --> 09:36.975
What he planned
to do with that bomb.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.177
(computer beeps)
oh. I have a match.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.146
Uh...

09:41.148 --> 09:44.983
Yeah. Uh, name is warren hackett
from atlanta, georgia.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.152
It's not our guy.
(groans)

09:47.154 --> 09:50.622
473 snowdrift lane?

09:50.624 --> 09:52.924
Last time it snowed in
atlanta, I had a fake I.D.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.060
Somebody wants to keep
this guy's identity a secret.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.829
Then we go old-school.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.699
Police are asking the public's
help in identifying this man.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.701
He was pulled
from a flood channel tonight

10:02.703 --> 10:04.369
In serious condition.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.172
If you have any information
about his identity,

10:07.174 --> 10:10.842
Please call
the las vegas police department.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.244
Hey.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.847
Oh, my god. I am so glad
to see you in one piece.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.616
(chuckles)
you and me both.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.351
I got you a veggie burger.
It's in the fridge if you want.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.320
Thanks. Uh, as soon as I get
my appetite back, I'm...

10:22.322 --> 10:24.322
Right. Well, you can
have it later, I guess.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.659
Um, so, I thought in order to
find where our bomber went in,

10:27.661 --> 10:32.664
So I got us a map of all
flood channels in vegas.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.200
I'm thinking he fell in the
water somewhere near his target.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.869
Okay, if I was a bomber,
I would look for someplace

10:37.871 --> 10:39.137
With a lot of people.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.338
Probably looking at a casino.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.375
Guy got pulled
out of the water... Here.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.677
Backtrack upstream.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.680
Closest likely targets are
the tangiers, queen regent

10:48.682 --> 10:50.649
And mediterranean.
(phone chiming)

10:51.417 --> 10:53.752
Oh. Our john doe's awake.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.655
I'm, uh, heading back
to the hospital.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.323
See you later.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.228
(coughing)

11:03.230 --> 11:05.230
This dust
could be toxic!

11:05.232 --> 11:07.098
Where's my particle mask?
(coughs)

11:07.100 --> 11:09.000
You got to die
from something.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.236
(groans, coughs)

11:11.238 --> 11:13.405
Man, sara held certain death

11:13.407 --> 11:16.207
In her hands for 20 minutes
and never moved.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.043
Do you think it's true
that your whole life flashes

11:18.045 --> 11:19.310
Before your eyes
in those situations?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.112
Did for me.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.881
I'm listening.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.684
I was 18,
getting my wisdom teeth pulled.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.152
When I got the anesthetic...

11:27.154 --> 11:29.421
Malignant hyperthermia
from anesthetic can be fatal.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.122
They need a crash cart?

11:31.124 --> 11:34.726
It was my first experience
with a mind-altering drug.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.761
I thought I was dying,

11:36.763 --> 11:38.329
Began to hyperventilate,
hallucinate.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.964
And?

11:39.966 --> 11:41.900
In my addled state,

11:41.902 --> 11:45.704
I fell madly in love
with the dental assistant.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.872
For some reason,
I had to tell everyone,

11:47.874 --> 11:49.708
Including her.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.243
Turns out, it was just an
adverse reaction to the drugs.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.344
(singsong):
Awkward.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.946
No. Humiliating.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.347
I never went back.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.415
I still have my wisdom teeth.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.783
You?

11:58.785 --> 12:00.885
Perhaps another time.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.787
Why don't you take what's
left of the satchel,

12:02.789 --> 12:04.723
And I'll concentrate
on the bomb frags.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.796
Man:
Margarit t'agavorakan.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.732
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

12:13.734 --> 12:14.866
Brass:
That's not english.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.768
Sounds slavic or russian
or something.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.737
Keeps saying it the same
way over and over again.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.238
Well, hold on,
I have a translator app.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.874
Maybe we can figure out
what he's saying.

12:23.509 --> 12:26.745
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

12:26.747 --> 12:28.113
(phone beeps)

12:28.115 --> 12:29.748
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

12:29.750 --> 12:31.116
He's speaking armenian.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.018
Margarit means "pearl."

12:34.020 --> 12:35.520
App doesn't recognize the rest.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.255
Guy with a bomb, speaking
a foreign language,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.491
Possibly in code,
hacked into afis

12:39.493 --> 12:40.925
So we don't
identify him.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.027
That's a guy with
a lot of expertise.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.896
That's the profile
for a terrorist.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.865
One thing I know
about terrorists:

12:46.867 --> 12:48.933
They never work alone.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.040
Hey, finn, I'd really like to
take a look at my case notes.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.342
Greg, I can't talk to you.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.477
I have to remain
completely objective

12:59.479 --> 13:02.046
While I work
with the defense expert.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.216
Finlay: <i>Greg sanders</i>
<i>worked this case solo,</i>

13:05.218 --> 13:07.085
So all of the
photographs are his.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.554
The left screen shows
the digital code--

13:09.556 --> 13:13.558
Shot sequence, date, time,
any edits or deletions.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.028
So we can tell if any of the
photographs have been altered.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.563
Greg started by
photographing the exterior

13:18.565 --> 13:21.166
Of the crime scene first,
which is protocol.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.569
Shots were almost
two minutes apart.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.173
Looks like he finished
the exteriors just after 0600.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.475
Now he's moved on,
inside the house.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.577
Starting with the
body in the bedroom.

13:32.579 --> 13:36.047
When I was working
crime scenes back in detroit,

13:36.049 --> 13:38.116
I liked to save
the victim's room for last.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.484
Hmm, I'm the opposite.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.586
I like to work the
toughest room first.

13:41.588 --> 13:45.190
The first shot of the
bedroom was an overall.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.424
First shot with
the crowbar

13:46.426 --> 13:48.960
Was a perspective shot.

13:48.962 --> 13:53.231
Rhodes: <i>Now sanders is moving in</i>
<i>for the close-ups.</i>

13:53.233 --> 13:56.201
20 minutes later, he finishes
photographing the bedroom.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.603
Moving on to do
the rest of the house.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.471
Finishes photographing
the rest of the house

14:00.473 --> 14:02.073
And returns to
the bedroom.

14:02.075 --> 14:05.143
What? He took over
50 photographs of the room.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.110
Why go back?

14:06.112 --> 14:11.149
Newer csis tend to take
more photographs than they need.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.451
I was taught that film
is cheap-- of course,

14:13.453 --> 14:16.120
That was back when
we used film.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.022
(chuckles)

14:19.592 --> 14:22.260
Look at that.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.565
Crowbar's been moved,
up and to the left.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.636
According to the
major incident log,

14:31.638 --> 14:33.371
Greg was alone
in the crime scene

14:33.373 --> 14:37.108
Until almost... 0730.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.610
When did the reference
blood arrive?

14:40.246 --> 14:42.380
He signed for it at 0705.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.149
So sanders was
in the crime scene

14:45.151 --> 14:48.419
With the reference blood
from ellis and the crowbar,

14:48.421 --> 14:50.555
Completely alone.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.258
(thunder rumbling)

14:53.260 --> 14:55.927
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

14:55.929 --> 14:58.630
Margarit t'agavorakan.

14:58.632 --> 15:01.132
Aren't you taking "death
imminent" a little too far?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.567
Not the first
time we've had

15:02.569 --> 15:06.671
Wanted to know if I could narrow
down where the guy came from.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.373
Hospitals are running
on generators,

15:08.375 --> 15:10.608
Not doing any elective tests,
so I brought him over.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.913
No surgeries, no birthmarks,
scars or identifying features.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.248
His teeth are coated
in fluoride,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.250
And he has a
porcelain filling.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.219
So if he is
from armenia,

15:21.221 --> 15:23.087
He came to america when
he was very young.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.291
They don't do dental work
like that over there.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.926
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

15:27.928 --> 15:29.294
Sounds like chanting to me.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.195
Word repetition.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.197
Reminds me of a
case where a man

15:33.199 --> 15:35.333
Fell into a frozen
lake in milwaukee,

15:35.335 --> 15:37.402
Came out speaking
portuguese.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.137
David, fire up the
fluoroscope, please.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.272
Yeah.
<i>Margarit t'agavorakanm.</i>

15:43.042 --> 15:45.043
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

15:52.251 --> 15:54.118
Bleeding at his temporal lobe.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.954
Could be a case
where head trauma causes

15:55.956 --> 15:58.289
A person to speak
a foreign language.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.460
It's a condition called tga--
transient global amnesia.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.128
It only lasts
about 24 hours.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.663
So, what he's saying
is coming from

16:05.665 --> 16:08.199
His subconscious,
something important to him.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.636
<i>Margarit t'agavorakan.</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:14.172
Mr. Sanders.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.640
You took these
photographs

16:15.642 --> 16:17.208
At the claire gibson
crime scene.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.310
34 minutes apart.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.283
The crowbar's been moved.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.019
Did you move it?

16:30.089 --> 16:31.289
If...

16:31.291 --> 16:34.125
I saw that the crowbar
had been moved,

16:34.127 --> 16:35.994
It would be in my notes.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.562
It's not noted.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.163
During the time

16:39.165 --> 16:41.432
Between these two photographs,
you were the only person

16:41.434 --> 16:44.235
Inside the crime scene.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.071
You know, I am so focused
on my own work, I...

16:47.073 --> 16:48.473
Barely notice
what anybody else

16:48.475 --> 16:51.409
Is doing at a scene.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.711
My former supervisor,
gil grissom,

16:53.713 --> 16:55.747
Trained me to follow
a particular procedure

16:55.749 --> 16:59.050
So I didn't have to
rely on my memory.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.552
Now, I was so afraid of
making a mistake and being

17:01.554 --> 17:03.087
Sent back to the lab

17:03.089 --> 17:05.590
That I followed that
training exactly.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.258
Finlay:
And yet, this evidence

17:07.260 --> 17:09.594
Was moved
after it was documented

17:09.596 --> 17:11.095
And before it was collected.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.130
Rhodes:
That's not protocol

17:12.132 --> 17:13.798
In any crime lab.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.034
I would be more than
happy to answer

17:16.036 --> 17:18.803
Your specific questions if I
could just review my notes.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.339
That's all we need right now.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.044
Should I be worried?

17:26.046 --> 17:28.813
Greg, a man served
seven years for a crime

17:28.815 --> 17:30.415
He did not commit.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.517
We   <i>al</i>should be worried.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.323
(thunder rumbling)

17:39.325 --> 17:42.160
I just heard you're in
the middle of a defense review.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.462
Yeah. Kind of rough.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.130
It's hell.

17:46.132 --> 17:48.299
It's the worst part of the job.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.735
Only, I'm not being accused
of making a mistake;

17:50.737 --> 17:53.104
I'm being accused
of planting evidence.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.473
Well...

17:55.475 --> 17:58.309
The evidence is gonna win out,
greg, I know it.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.378
(phone ringing)
yeah.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.081
Oh, shoot, I got to go.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.316
Brass found
the bomber's hotel room.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.585
I'll call you later, okay?

18:12.191 --> 18:13.558
(siren whoops,
indistinct police radio chatter)

18:13.560 --> 18:15.426
Brass: So, the manager
of the motel

18:15.428 --> 18:17.728
Recognized our john doe
from the tv news.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.363
Said he checked in
yesterday.

18:19.365 --> 18:22.667
After she called the hotline,
right, she checked his room,

18:22.669 --> 18:24.469
Saw some guy tossing it.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.170
She get a description?

18:26.172 --> 18:30.508
You know, he saw her, he freaked
out, he jumped off the balcony.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.710
Here's the manager here;
she has a heart condition.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.412
She's on the oxygen
and a cigarette.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.647
Thanks for your help.
I hope you feel better.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.850
Got to love vegas, huh?

18:44.723 --> 18:47.258
Sidle: Looks like our bomber's
friends got here before we did.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.427
Got scared off.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.430
Well, whatever they were after
must have been important.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.332
Something that would
tell us who they are.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.701
Or where their next target is.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.708
His clothes are mostly
in a pile by his suitcase.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.877
I'm not sure he ever unpacked.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.146
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

19:11.483 --> 19:14.652
Three pair of tightie-whities
means three days of travel.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.653
No suits.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.555
All his clothes are casual.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.857
Maybe a little too casual.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.560
Brody:
I got two chargers.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.365
No electronics.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.467
No evidence the bomb
was assembled here.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.840
(thunder rumbling)

19:48.420 --> 19:50.555
I got an american passport.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.557
It's our bomber.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.659
Name's arman agakian.

19:54.661 --> 19:55.660
Armenian surname.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.498
Sidle:
Huh.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.503
I got a flash drive.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.538
Guy hides a flash drive

20:07.540 --> 20:08.839
And a passport.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.775
We might be looking at a pro.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.420
(beeps, buzzes)

20:30.963 --> 20:32.697
Ah, henry.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.565
You're just in time
for my demonstration.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.401
Wait, you seriously
built a bomb?

20:37.403 --> 20:38.703
I'm going back to tox.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.571
I chemically tested
the bomb frags,

20:40.573 --> 20:43.574
Pieced together what I could,
then used identical components

20:43.576 --> 20:46.611
To precisely duplicate
sara's bomb.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.280
This is disturbing
in so many ways.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.649
Why? It's just a magnetic
switch, circuit board delay,

20:51.651 --> 20:54.318
Military blasting cap,
and a couple of pipes.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.953
'kay, just to confirm,

20:55.955 --> 20:58.022
Your bomb doesn't actually
contain explosives?

20:58.024 --> 21:01.259
No. It's identical to the
original complex pipe bomb,

21:01.261 --> 21:04.695
Except I substituted
lightbulbs for explosives.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.330
Now, lifting this switch

21:06.332 --> 21:08.733
Will duplicate the
action that sara took

21:08.735 --> 21:11.636
When she opened up the
magnetized satchel flaps.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.538
If it's all wired correctly,
then the lightbulb should go on.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.874
For the boom, you'll just
have to use your imagination.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.376
Uh... If this does blow up,

21:18.378 --> 21:21.512
I will come back from
the dead and haunt you.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.581
This is perfectly safe.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.517
(gasps)

21:26.519 --> 21:28.519
Well, that was fascinating.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.955
I came by to give you
dna results.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.657
Uh, no dna off the bomb parts.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.660
Only john doe's dna
on the straps of the satchel.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.695
So it's back to
the drawing board.

21:37.697 --> 21:38.896
You want to help me?

21:38.898 --> 21:39.930
No, thanks.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.033
I'm testing something for finn.

21:43.835 --> 21:45.436
(sighs)

21:48.874 --> 21:52.777
Ecklie wanted me to review
the-the gibson case as well,

21:52.779 --> 21:54.645
Because the department
and the d.A.'s office

21:54.647 --> 21:56.314
Are named in the lawsuit.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.782
Sit down for a second.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.887
13 women reported seeing ellis
outside their homes

22:02.889 --> 22:04.522
<i>Over a two-month period.</i>

22:04.524 --> 22:08.092
<i>He was caught on three</i>
<i>separate security cameras.</i>

22:08.094 --> 22:10.328
He had no criminal record, yet.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.763
Although, escalation's
pretty common

22:12.765 --> 22:13.931
For voyeurs.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.100
At the trial,
a coworker testified

22:16.102 --> 22:19.070
That ellis threatened
to get even with claire gibson

22:19.072 --> 22:21.372
Because she had started
the whole thing

22:21.374 --> 22:23.474
By calling the police.

22:23.476 --> 22:27.445
So ellis definitely had motive
to kill claire gibson.

22:27.447 --> 22:28.813
I mean, if this
happened today,

22:28.815 --> 22:31.048
Brass would be
all over him like that.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.683
That all may be true,

22:32.685 --> 22:34.852
But we've just found
uncontroverted evidence

22:34.854 --> 22:38.122
That the crowbar was moved
at the scene.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.659
Things get moved accidentally
at crime scenes all the time.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.694
Greg was the only person
in the crime scene

22:43.696 --> 22:44.829
When it happened.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.764
(sighs)

22:46.766 --> 22:48.766
All right, you know,

22:48.768 --> 22:51.569
Leaving aside the fact
that we know greg,

22:51.571 --> 22:54.939
What possible reason would
he have to frame gus ellis?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.140
It doesn't make
any sense.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.042
A new csi trying
to impress his boss.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.711
No, I'm not buying that.

23:00.713 --> 23:05.383
You know, I may be the
newest csi around here,

23:05.385 --> 23:07.718
But it's a pretty rotten job
to have to comb through

23:07.720 --> 23:09.787
All of greg's work.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.392
I didn't choose you
because you're new, jules,

23:14.394 --> 23:16.494
I chose you
because you've been there.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.929
You know how this
has to go.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.732
I hated you when
you investigated me.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.135
I don't want greg
to feel the same.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.803
It's a search for the truth.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.805
He'll get over it,
just like you did.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.574
Now, tell me
about this crowbar.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.143
Whose was it again?

23:33.111 --> 23:35.746
Joe gibson, claire's brother,

23:35.748 --> 23:39.483
Came over to fix a broken gutter
the morning of the murder.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.786
He left it outside,
so it's his.

23:41.788 --> 23:44.422
D.A.'s theory
was that ellis

23:44.424 --> 23:46.991
Used the crowbar
to break into the house,

23:46.993 --> 23:49.827
Broke a window,
cut himself in the process.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.830
There was only one
small smear of blood found

23:52.832 --> 23:54.899
In the entire crime scene.

23:54.901 --> 23:58.469
Ellis's attorney
only has to show

23:58.471 --> 24:01.772
Access and opportunity
to implicate greg.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.842
Defense attorneys are gonna
bring up this allegation

24:04.844 --> 24:07.077
Every single time
he testifies.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.548
He is going to be a liability
on every case he works.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.451
His career will be over.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.186
(phone chimes)

24:15.188 --> 24:17.621
I got to go.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.525
Finlay:
What'd you get?

24:21.527 --> 24:24.795
Can I just say this?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.997
Greg is one of the most
honest guys I know,

24:26.999 --> 24:28.599
And a great csi.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.035
He would never intentionally
compromise a case.

24:36.875 --> 24:40.845
Uh... One microliter
per mil of edta

24:40.847 --> 24:43.147
Was detected in the blood
from the crowbar.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.181
Blood preservative.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.616
That would be consistent

24:45.618 --> 24:48.786
With blood collected
in an edta tube.

24:48.788 --> 24:49.854
Thanks, henry.

24:49.856 --> 24:53.524
You should add that there are
trace levels of edta

24:53.526 --> 24:54.758
In our blood from hundreds

24:54.760 --> 24:57.061
Of everyday items--
soap, mayonnaise,

24:57.063 --> 24:58.729
Salad dressing, beer, milk...

24:58.731 --> 25:01.632
...Soda, ointments,
detergents, breakfast...

25:01.634 --> 25:03.634
Henry, I get it.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.269
You know what? It's fine.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.905
I'll just put it
in my report.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.708
I will, too.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.010
(thunder rumbling)

25:23.088 --> 25:24.989
(sighs)

25:27.926 --> 25:29.593
Sanders.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.295
Right?

25:31.297 --> 25:34.131
She looked at you like
you were guilty of something.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.034
Excuse me?
Terri royce,
the new chemist.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.002
Oh.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.870
What'd you do?

25:39.872 --> 25:42.006
Uh, nothing.
I... It's...

25:42.008 --> 25:44.174
Good heavens, spit it out.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.844
I'm being sued
for planting evidence.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.979
(laughs)
we've all been accused of that.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.881
You didn't do it, did you?

25:50.883 --> 25:52.216
No. Of course not.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.184
Good. Come in here and help me

25:54.186 --> 25:56.253
With this armenian
bomber evidence.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.025
Gcms identified
polyunsaturated oil

26:01.027 --> 26:04.161
Consistent with peanut oil
from the suspect's pants

26:04.163 --> 26:05.863
In fragments of the satchel.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.032
Take a look.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.668
Sanders: Looks like what ends up
at the bottom of a deep fryer.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.003
I worked at a fast-food
joint in high school.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.738
Ha! Me, too.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.006
I'm from new orleans.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.008
I didn't want to I.D.
Fried food on my first day.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.243
What would y'all think?

26:19.245 --> 26:21.946
A couple of days ago,
a barrel of frying oil

26:21.948 --> 26:24.148
Intended for
recycling got spilled

26:24.150 --> 26:26.884
Outside the mediterranean
and caught fire.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.086
Closed the loading
dock for hours.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.988
That would explain this.

26:36.995 --> 26:38.295
Sanders:
Carbon ash?

26:38.297 --> 26:40.798
From the fire.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.032
Looks like the bomber
was hanging

26:42.034 --> 26:44.034
At the loading dock
of the mediterranean.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.970
Which has direct access
to the flood channel.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.739
I think you just found
the bomber's target.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.241
(laughs)
all day long.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.944
Thanks for saving
me and coming out.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.779
Hey, any day
I can be outside

26:55.781 --> 26:57.281
Without my blast suit
is a good day.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.716
(chuckles)

26:58.718 --> 27:00.684
I wanted to get a
bomb expert's opinion

27:00.686 --> 27:02.086
On our guy's activities.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.854
Glad I could help.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.056
So, arman agakian
gets pulled out

27:06.058 --> 27:09.994
Of this flood control channel
about three miles downstream,

27:09.996 --> 27:12.062
Holding a bomb.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.766
We couldn't
get past here.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.150
This is how he got in.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.319
Anthony:
Yeah, but where was he headed?

27:40.058 --> 27:43.994
Sidle: Maybe he was trying
to take a shortcut upstream

27:43.996 --> 27:45.396
To the other end
of the mediterranean.

27:45.398 --> 27:48.098
I mean, no terrorist would want
to walk through the casino

27:48.100 --> 27:49.333
And be on a hundred cameras.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.269
It's way more stealth
out here, but...

27:52.271 --> 27:54.038
He didn't make it.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.407
He slipped, fell in, and
was swept downstream.

27:56.409 --> 27:57.841
Yeah, makes sense.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.009
Trace evidence we found tells us

27:59.011 --> 28:01.078
That he was
at this loading dock.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.414
I was hoping you could help me
narrow down a logical target.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.948
Yeah. Let's go take a look.

28:04.950 --> 28:07.217
Thanks.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.286
(people chattering)

28:12.323 --> 28:15.292
This is where
that oil fire was.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.962
For a bomb that size,
you'd need the perfect location.

28:18.964 --> 28:22.166
In iraq, they'd put bombs
in culverts under the road.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.768
You know, out of sight,
maximum damage.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.271
Kind of like a gas main
under a casino.

28:31.242 --> 28:33.310
Thanks.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.950
A hell of
a force multiplier.

28:39.952 --> 28:43.120
Even a small charge would
kill a lot of people.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.889
Sidle: There's a disturbance
in the dirt under this meter.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.025
Could be from a satchel.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.128
And somebody left...

28:51.130 --> 28:54.498
A little calling card
on this sharp edge.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.966
(thunder rumbling)

28:58.470 --> 29:02.272
Perfect time
for my new dna instrument.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.874
You have a mobile lab?

29:03.876 --> 29:05.109
In the back of my car.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.177
No extractions,
quick results.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.278
You want to see it?

29:11.316 --> 29:12.783
Wow.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.092
(machine beeps)

29:24.062 --> 29:25.229
(beeping)

29:26.531 --> 29:28.398
(siren approaching)

29:28.400 --> 29:32.770
So someone else placed the bomb,
and agakian removed it?

29:32.772 --> 29:33.771
(car door opens)

29:33.773 --> 29:35.139
Sara?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.374
Thought you'd
want to know.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.942
Agakian flatlined

29:38.944 --> 29:41.111
An hour ago at
the hospital.
What?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.379
He did not have
life-threatening injuries.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.248
I just saw him
with doc robbins.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.249
David phillips
is picking him up.

29:45.251 --> 29:47.017
(sighs)

29:47.019 --> 29:48.218
Damn it!

29:54.125 --> 29:55.325
Uh, hi. Uh...

29:55.327 --> 29:57.194
Can I help you?

29:57.196 --> 29:59.930
Yeah. I'm from the
coroner's office.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.800
I'm here to pick up
a... Arman agakian?

30:02.802 --> 30:03.901
No can do, pal.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.369
I have my orders.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.404
Federal orders trump yours.

30:07.406 --> 30:10.240
He's fbi property now.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.823
I went to tovin's in pahrump.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.491
Best baklava in nevada.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.326
I brought you
some pastry.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.462
And I got tovin to translate
that mystery armenian phrase.

30:32.464 --> 30:34.498
The guy is saying "pearl royal."

30:34.500 --> 30:36.233
Sounds like the name
of a stripper.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.968
(laughs): Yeah,
it does, doesn't it?

30:37.970 --> 30:40.137
How you holding up?

30:40.139 --> 30:42.439
Just eager for this whole thing
to be over with.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.974
It's crazy, right?

30:43.976 --> 30:47.411
Everything we do every
day is scrutinized,

30:47.413 --> 30:51.448
But it's different
when it happens in front of you.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.916
In your own lab.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.452
I just wish that
I could remember more details.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.454
Greg, you've worked hundreds
of cases since then.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.489
You can't expect
to remember every detail.

30:59.491 --> 31:03.260
Yeah, but the details that
they found don't look too good.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.362
And if finn and that

31:05.364 --> 31:08.599
Expert can't exonerate me--

31:08.601 --> 31:11.335
And I mean completely--

31:11.337 --> 31:14.571
I'm through as a csi.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.641
Edta in the blood
from the crowbar

31:17.643 --> 31:19.343
Is consistent with
the hospital blood tube.

31:19.345 --> 31:23.146
We need to nail down
sanders' timeline.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.615
Well, I tracked his movements
through the crime scene

31:24.617 --> 31:27.184
Based on the
photo data code.

31:27.186 --> 31:31.388
0617 to 0637,
greg took 57 shots

31:31.390 --> 31:33.490
In the bedroom with the victim.

31:33.492 --> 31:36.093
Then he moved through the house,
taking a total of 45

31:36.095 --> 31:38.562
Other shots encompassing
25 minutes.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.364
Finlay:
<i>Exited the house to receive</i>

31:40.366 --> 31:43.000
<i>Ellis's reference blood</i>
<i>at 0705,</i>

31:43.002 --> 31:46.003
<i>Factoring in a couple</i>
<i>of minutes to sign</i>

31:46.005 --> 31:47.337
<i>And initial the paperwork.</i>

31:47.339 --> 31:49.373
<i>He then returned to the house.</i>

31:49.375 --> 31:53.043
He took the photo
showing the moved crowbar.

31:53.045 --> 31:57.414
If sanders made a conscious
decision to frame ellis,

31:57.416 --> 32:00.350
Four minutes is
enough time to do it.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.519
All right, let's see.

32:02.521 --> 32:06.256
<i>He'd have to carefully</i>
<i>break the seal, open the tube,</i>

32:06.258 --> 32:08.425
Smear the blood on the crowbar,

32:08.427 --> 32:10.594
<i>Put the cap back on,</i>

32:10.596 --> 32:13.030
<i>Reseal the package</i>
<i>and take the photo.</i>

32:13.032 --> 32:16.266
All with no guarantee
that he wouldn't be seen.

32:16.268 --> 32:22.105
Who received ellis's
reference blood at the lab?

32:22.107 --> 32:26.176
Did they note any
discrepancies in the seal?

32:26.178 --> 32:29.613
Finlay: Uh, wendy simms,
the dna analyst at the time,

32:29.615 --> 32:31.448
Received the blood sealed
and initialed.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.116
It's in her notes.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.185
Rhodes:
And then sanders took

32:35.187 --> 32:36.954
The final four shots
in the bedroom,

32:36.956 --> 32:39.456
And then no more,
until the exterior shots

32:39.458 --> 32:41.658
After the scene was broken down.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.460
To document the condition
of the crime scene

32:43.462 --> 32:45.662
After the police had left,
which is protocol.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.999
Wait a second.
You see that?

32:50.134 --> 32:52.402
There's blood
on the sidewalk

32:52.404 --> 32:54.304
Outside the scene.

32:57.175 --> 33:00.243
There was no blood outside
the perimeter in any of

33:00.245 --> 33:01.545
Greg's initial shots.

33:01.547 --> 33:05.248
Outside the scene after
the perimeter was set.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.451
Gravitational drops.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.052
Where did that blood
come from?

33:09.054 --> 33:10.554
Simms also tested

33:10.556 --> 33:13.490
A handkerchief
that was in ellis's pocket

33:13.492 --> 33:15.625
When he was booked.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.728
Blood on both
was ellis's.

33:17.730 --> 33:20.530
How did the blood get
on the handkerchief?

33:20.532 --> 33:24.234
Doctor at the hospital noted
that ellis had no injuries.

33:24.236 --> 33:27.437
Added what looks like "noble"
in all caps.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.709
Does ellis look like a
handkerchief kind of guy to you?

33:37.115 --> 33:39.182
Finlay: Amino black
reacts with the blood.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.651
Rhodes:
Look at ridge detail.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.553
It's surprising simms didn't
process the fingerprint

33:43.555 --> 33:45.155
In the first place.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.490
Well, there was
no context for it.

33:46.492 --> 33:48.358
The only useful evidence
would have been

33:48.360 --> 33:50.727
To find claire gibson's blood
on the handkerchief.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.596
Otherwise, it's just
ellis's blood

33:52.598 --> 33:56.099
On ellis's handkerchief
in ellis's pants, so...

33:56.101 --> 33:58.301
Wouldn't have been
a big deal.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.670
(beeping)

34:03.274 --> 34:05.509
"yancey langer.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.210
Restricted access."

34:07.212 --> 34:08.578
State employee?

34:08.580 --> 34:11.581
His name is on the
major incident log.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.586
Does this look
familiar to you?

34:16.588 --> 34:19.156
Looks like the handkerchiefs

34:19.158 --> 34:21.391
My mom always buys me
for christmas.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.626
Why?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.394
Do you remember
claire gibson's murder

34:24.396 --> 34:26.163
From March 21, 2006?

34:26.165 --> 34:27.564
Sure.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.699
I remember everything.
It was my first murder scene.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.535
I was a police explorer
back then.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.638
Your handkerchief was found
inside gus ellis's pocket.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.473
He was the suspect at the time.
Can you explain that?

34:36.475 --> 34:40.544
Yeah. I was waiting on a radio
car to take him to the hospital

34:40.546 --> 34:42.746
To get a blood sample
or something.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.749
Guy was sitting on the curb,
scared, got a nosebleed.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.085
<i>He was dripping blood</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>

34:48.087 --> 34:52.622
<i>I tried to stop it,</i>
<i>then gave him my handkerchief.</i>

34:52.624 --> 34:54.724
Nosebleed. N-o-b-l.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.627
That was the abbreviation
on the doctor's notes.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.463
Rhodes: According to the
major incident log,

34:59.465 --> 35:00.630
You stayed outside
the perimeter

35:00.632 --> 35:03.700
Of the crime scene
the whole time.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.602
That's not true, is it?

35:07.238 --> 35:10.507
When the officers left with the
suspect, I snuck into the scene.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.410
I never saw
a dead body before.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.744
Did you touch anything while

35:14.746 --> 35:17.380
You were in there?
No.

35:17.382 --> 35:18.882
Are you sure?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.586
I tripped.

35:28.426 --> 35:29.593
<i>Kicked a crowbar on the floor,</i>

35:29.595 --> 35:32.429
<i>But I put it right back</i>
<i>where it was.</i>

35:32.431 --> 35:36.733
Do you realize that you
transferred ellis's blood

35:36.735 --> 35:38.802
From your hand
to that crowbar?

35:42.340 --> 35:46.276
That blood was the physical
evidence that convicted him.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.513
Rhodes: Gus ellis spent
seven years in prison

35:49.515 --> 35:52.549
Because you went
into a crime scene unauthorized

35:52.551 --> 35:56.453
To see a body
and contaminated the evidence.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.690
I never followed up
on the case.

36:00.692 --> 36:04.261
Didn't even know
the guy was convicted.

36:04.263 --> 36:07.164
I'm so sorry.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.833
I...

36:09.835 --> 36:11.868
I didn't know.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.872
I'm gonna make some calls.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.813
Andrews:
Is it safe in here,

36:23.815 --> 36:27.317
Still can't figure out
how the bomb was activated.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.819
I'm stumped. I've double-checked
all the connections

36:29.821 --> 36:31.788
From the magnetic switch
to the circuit boards

36:31.790 --> 36:33.757
To the blasting caps
to the pipes.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.525
Still doesn't work.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.460
Then the circuit
isn't the problem.

36:37.462 --> 36:38.695
Let me see.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.798
Blasting caps creep me out.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.700
I remember a public service film

36:43.702 --> 36:46.469
In grammar school taught
kids not to play with them.

36:46.471 --> 36:47.871
Showed a kid who
bit down on one.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.506
Ugh!
Yeah.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.342
Made a big impression on him.
And me.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.244
Just... (imitates explosion)

36:56.714 --> 37:00.317
That blasting cap
completely fragmented.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.885
Why is this one still intact?

37:01.887 --> 37:03.486
There's white powder
still inside.

37:03.488 --> 37:05.422
I mean, shouldn't
the explosive be brown?

37:05.424 --> 37:08.858
Rdx and petn are both white.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.560
But this should have been
completely consumed

37:10.562 --> 37:11.595
In the controlled blast.

37:11.597 --> 37:15.632
Yeah, we should test it.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.335
By "we," you mean me?

37:18.337 --> 37:19.502
Primary explosives are
friction-sensitive

37:19.504 --> 37:20.670
And flammable.

37:20.672 --> 37:24.608
I'm a body fluid guy.
Not touching that.

37:34.852 --> 37:37.587
Powder should burn
when exposed to flame.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.599
Andrews:
Well, there's the problem.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.434
That white stuff
isn't explosive.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.837
That bomb was never intended
to go off.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.443
How's it going?

38:00.445 --> 38:02.812
God, I have tried
everything I can think of.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.914
Anything that we found
in the hotel room,

38:04.916 --> 38:06.583
Anything that
he was hiding,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.551
Anything we know about agakian--
none of it's working.

38:08.553 --> 38:09.919
I just... I can't
figure out

38:09.921 --> 38:12.055
The pass code
to this flash drive.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.891
Have you tried the info
from that bogus afis hit?

38:14.893 --> 38:16.893
Everything I can think of.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.763
What about... The fake address?

38:20.464 --> 38:22.465
What was it again?

38:22.467 --> 38:25.635
473 snowdrift lane.

38:27.338 --> 38:29.339
(computer trilling)

38:32.777 --> 38:35.045
Look at the intersection
that's highlighted.

38:38.382 --> 38:40.617
We cracked the password
on that flash drive.

38:40.619 --> 38:44.321
But it looks like
I'm a little late.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.389
Csi sidle.
Sara, this is

38:46.391 --> 38:47.957
Ben parker,
special agent, fbi.

38:47.959 --> 38:50.393
We'll need
to take that flash drive.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.569
Cut your arm
on a gas meter cage?

39:02.708 --> 39:06.576
Although, I'm sure
that's not his real name.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.546
He's probably
not dead, either.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.580
Agakian's fbi, sara.

39:10.582 --> 39:11.848
He's been working

39:11.850 --> 39:13.616
Undercover
for the last couple years

39:13.618 --> 39:16.419
To infiltrate the armenian mob.

39:16.421 --> 39:19.589
They've been extorting money
from the mediterranean.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.557
He posed
as an explosives specialist.

39:20.559 --> 39:21.691
Last night was his big drop.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.060
You gave him two dud bombs

39:24.062 --> 39:26.563
That seemed very real

39:26.565 --> 39:28.732
<i>To plant at the mediterranean.</i>

39:28.734 --> 39:31.668
(thunder rumbling)

39:32.937 --> 39:36.106
<i>He planted the first one.</i>

39:36.108 --> 39:39.676
<i>When he went</i>
<i>to plant the second one...</i>

39:41.445 --> 39:44.714
<i>...He slipped into the flood</i>
<i>channel and got washed away.</i>

39:50.521 --> 39:52.622
After that,
we had to abort the op.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.391
We picked up the bomb
at the loading dock.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.793
Scratching your agent's arm
in the process.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.696
How does planting dud bombs
help your undercover op?

39:59.698 --> 40:02.165
We planned to discover the bombs
very publicly first,

40:02.167 --> 40:04.434
Then release to the media
that they were very dangerous

40:04.436 --> 40:07.604
Fooling the armenians and
establishing your agent

40:07.606 --> 40:09.172
As an explosives expert.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.108
What about the
intersection

40:12.110 --> 40:14.477
Of pearl street and
royal avenue in north vegas?

40:14.479 --> 40:19.516
That's where our undercover
met his armenian contact.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.618
Probably why pearl-royal stuck
in his mind.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.754
And the extortion plot--
has that been aborted as well?

40:24.756 --> 40:26.089
Our undercover was able

40:26.091 --> 40:27.590
To identify
the individuals responsible.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.691
We're arresting them
right now.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.160
Good.

40:30.162 --> 40:31.795
Parker's men are gonna need

40:31.797 --> 40:33.163
To take custody
of all the evidence.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.831
Of course.

40:34.833 --> 40:38.168
If we're square here, I need
to speak to captain jim brass.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.770
Sounds like a good idea.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.809
Woman:
<i>Federal agents descended</i>

40:45.811 --> 40:47.844
On the mediterranean casino
today,

40:47.846 --> 40:50.847
<i>Taking five armenian nationals</i>
<i>into custody.</i>

40:50.849 --> 40:54.117
<i>The individuals arrested</i>
<i>are suspected to be members</i>

40:54.119 --> 40:56.786
<i>Of an armenian</i>
<i>organized crime ring.</i>

40:56.788 --> 40:58.188
Our lawyers scheduled
a deposition

40:58.190 --> 41:00.089
With langer
for next week.

41:00.091 --> 41:03.793
Unsure how it's gonna turn out,
but sanders is off the hook.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.595
I'm glad.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.097
Well, no offense, but I hope
the next time I see you

41:08.099 --> 41:10.066
Will be at an american
academy meeting.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.135
(laughs)

41:14.071 --> 41:15.972
See you later.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.808
Thank you.

41:19.777 --> 41:21.778
Hey.
Hey.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.779
Talked to greg.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.813
How's he doing?

41:23.815 --> 41:25.849
Look, I guess I get

41:25.851 --> 41:28.751
Why you thought you had to
treat him the way that you did,

41:28.753 --> 41:31.087
But it's tough to be on
the receiving end of that.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.822
Yeah, I know.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.724
I had an I.A. Investigation
in seattle,

41:34.726 --> 41:37.827
And russell treated me
the exact same way.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.930
Still not over it.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.001
Greg's in the locker room.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.279
Hey. Congratulations.

41:56.281 --> 41:59.082
Thanks.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.284
I know I was really hard on you.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.019
I was trying to do my best

42:03.021 --> 42:05.255
For someone
that I really do care about,

42:05.257 --> 42:07.557
But I couldn't act like it.

42:07.559 --> 42:08.958
I had to seem impartial,

42:08.960 --> 42:11.227
Or it really would have
hurt your case.

42:11.229 --> 42:13.930
Hey, I understand.

42:15.566 --> 42:18.234
Greg, I never thought
you did anything wrong.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.273
How about that grilled cheese
at rj's?

42:23.275 --> 42:25.942
That sounds great.

42:25.944 --> 42:28.044
My treat?

42:28.046 --> 42:29.112
Okay.
