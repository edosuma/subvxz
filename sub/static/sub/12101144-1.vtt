(car horn honking)

01:07.696 --> 01:10.438
(footsteps thudding)

01:10.438 --> 01:13.438
(objects rummaging)

01:37.881 --> 01:40.214
- Is there anyone out there?

01:44.250 --> 01:45.733
Enter if you dare (laughs).

01:52.088 --> 01:56.362
Anna, are you sure you
put this folder down here?

01:56.362 --> 01:59.195
(folder clanking)

02:25.623 --> 02:26.456
(sighs) This.

02:33.671 --> 02:38.671
(object clanking)
(knife thudding)

02:41.620 --> 02:42.683
- Ciao bella.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.293
- Who are you?

02:52.596 --> 02:53.429
(folder thudding)

02:53.429 --> 02:55.073
Do you have any idea who I am?

02:58.610 --> 03:01.360
(knife thudding)

03:35.150 --> 03:38.150
(Marsha whimpering)

03:40.511 --> 03:44.594
(speaking in a foreign language)

04:06.659 --> 04:11.659
(whimpers) Leave now, and I
won't have my husband kill you.

04:14.172 --> 04:16.922
(Mario laughing)

04:21.649 --> 04:25.399
What do you want (whimpers)?

04:29.965 --> 04:32.855
(chokes) Don't (grunts).

04:32.855 --> 04:33.688
- Anna.

04:37.565 --> 04:42.565
(Marsha wheezing)
(bone crunching)

04:52.461 --> 04:55.544
(footsteps thudding)

05:07.174 --> 05:08.007
Anna?

05:12.709 --> 05:17.709
Anna?
(church bell ringing)

05:26.930 --> 05:29.619
- I was thinking you'd change your mind.

05:29.619 --> 05:31.591
- Well, it had crossed my mind.

05:31.591 --> 05:32.936
- You got the money?

05:32.936 --> 05:34.662
- Have I ever let you down before.

05:34.662 --> 05:37.726
- There's always a first time.

05:37.726 --> 05:41.476
- (sighs) Let's get a drink.

05:43.449 --> 05:46.740
(people murmuring)
(slow rock music)

05:46.740 --> 05:47.573
Thank you.

05:51.276 --> 05:54.567
(Edward sighing)

05:54.567 --> 05:56.915
I lost my wife too,

05:56.915 --> 05:59.315
it's something you have
to live With day by day.

06:00.830 --> 06:03.670
- My wife was murdered, and
my only daughter kidnapped.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.237
It's not quite the same, is it?

06:06.122 --> 06:07.300
- But they certainly
picked the wrong family

06:07.300 --> 06:09.300
to target this time around, didn't they?

06:10.589 --> 06:12.639
But you must be careful not to be caught.

06:14.470 --> 06:16.263
- I'm gonna find my daughter, Edward.

06:20.245 --> 06:23.260
(envelope rustling)
(envelope whooshing)

06:23.260 --> 06:26.547
- That's the rest of the
cash, 5,000 Sterling.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.213
That's all you got for the duration.

06:33.801 --> 06:36.551
- I need more.
- There is no more.

06:38.149 --> 06:39.940
You know Samuel Archer
has got so many people

06:39.940 --> 06:40.773
working for him?

06:42.450 --> 06:43.960
His web covers The globe,

06:43.960 --> 06:46.653
he's even got links to the FBI.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.110
You'll find photographs
of his men in here.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.610
He's chosen a small railroad
town to do their business from

06:54.610 --> 06:57.393
this time around, it's well off the radar.

06:58.230 --> 07:00.340
I've included the location
with the photographs,

07:00.340 --> 07:02.043
but that's all the information we have.

07:03.210 --> 07:06.240
The rest of, Kit, will be down to you,

07:06.240 --> 07:08.480
so I'm sure you'll be fine.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.160
You've tracked human trafficking
gangs your entire career,

07:11.160 --> 07:13.070
that should be total.

07:13.070 --> 07:14.120
- Oh, I'll find them.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.670
- You know, MI5 have produced

07:16.670 --> 07:19.513
some wonderful intelligence
officers over the years.

07:20.350 --> 07:22.470
Don't let what happened
to your wife and daughter

07:22.470 --> 07:24.153
clouds your professionalism.

07:25.150 --> 07:26.453
Consider this a favor.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.483
♪ I'm telling myself ♪

07:28.483 --> 07:32.040
I won't be sending you on to
more service stars as well.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.390
You're lucky we're friends.

07:35.159 --> 07:38.677
- I want to be able to look
them in the eyes, just once.

07:38.677 --> 07:40.110
- I know.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.580
Look, once you finish your assignment,

07:42.580 --> 07:45.380
just get a fast train back
to London, do you understand?

07:46.990 --> 07:47.823
- Yes, sir.

07:49.030 --> 07:52.060
- Well, there were many
didn't want me to send you?

07:52.060 --> 07:54.940
They said you were far too
close to the tree, so to speak,

07:54.940 --> 07:58.370
I just hope you appreciate all my efforts.

08:00.955 --> 08:03.030
- Anything else?

08:03.030 --> 08:03.933
- Yeah, actually.

08:05.456 --> 08:06.289
Listen,

08:08.244 --> 08:10.028
when you feel ready to talk

08:10.028 --> 08:14.921
about (stammers) about what happened,

08:14.921 --> 08:17.838
I can be a very good listener also.

08:21.260 --> 08:22.510
- I'll keep it in mind, thanks.

08:22.510 --> 08:23.510
- Well, you do that.

08:26.407 --> 08:28.073
- One more thing.
- What's that?

08:29.153 --> 08:30.770
- When I find Samuel Archer,

08:30.770 --> 08:32.620
I'm gonna kill him very slowly.

08:32.620 --> 08:34.483
- You can do what you like to Archer,

08:35.820 --> 08:38.553
just make sure you get the
first train back to London.

08:39.540 --> 08:41.760
A cover story is already in place.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.720
We can't have a MI5 agent found
dead in small town, England,

08:45.720 --> 08:47.643
do you understand, Kit?
- Understood.

08:48.530 --> 08:49.363
- Good (sighs).

08:52.040 --> 08:54.463
When you finish your
drink, get a taxi Rosedale.

08:55.441 --> 08:58.330
Your tickets have been
booked in advance (gulps).

08:59.993 --> 09:03.410
All right, it's a lovely
little town you'll be visiting,

09:03.410 --> 09:05.260
you should enjoy the peace and quiet.

09:07.620 --> 09:08.453
Good luck.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.450
(birds chirping)

09:49.940 --> 09:51.600
- Any news on Kit?

09:51.600 --> 09:53.290
- He arrived this morning.

09:53.290 --> 09:55.610
He'll be out hunting already, I expect.

09:55.610 --> 09:59.650
- Wouldn't it be easier if
Samuel just had him killed?

09:59.650 --> 10:01.390
- I'm the one who controls Samuel,

10:01.390 --> 10:03.463
I'm the one that pulls
the strings around here.

10:04.610 --> 10:07.500
Anyways, It's my idea to
bring his daughter in,

10:07.500 --> 10:08.750
It's my mess to clear up.

10:09.850 --> 10:14.570
- That's why I love you, my
sweet little puppet master.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.733

us, I'd left him all alone.

- Who are you?

10:53.400 --> 10:55.120
- Could we talk inside?

10:55.120 --> 10:58.005
- We can talk here, here is just fine.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.855

11:12.270 --> 11:15.300
- Information?
- Where's your boss, Mark.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.270
My boss?
- Where's Archer.

11:18.270 --> 11:21.790
- I don't know.
(Mark whimpering)

11:21.790 --> 11:23.190
- You don't have to do that.

11:25.006 --> 11:27.933
- I'm gonna ask you one
more time, where is he?

11:28.930 --> 11:32.490
- And if I tell ya,
what will you do to him?

11:32.490 --> 11:33.920
- I shall kill him, Mark,

11:33.920 --> 11:35.610
there's a very good
chance I shall kill him.

11:35.610 --> 11:36.760
- Who are you (grunts)?

11:37.827 --> 11:39.420
- I'm the husband of the wife

11:39.420 --> 11:41.170
you and your boss helped to murder.

11:42.982 --> 11:45.130
- (strains) I'm not going to help ya.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.557

11:47.557 --> 11:48.940
(knife thudding)
(Mark whimpering)

11:48.940 --> 11:49.773
- Location.

11:50.804 --> 11:53.147
- 21 First Street (whimpers).

11:54.131 --> 11:58.960
(Mark grunting)
(knife thudding)

11:58.960 --> 12:00.910
- Ah, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

12:06.273 --> 12:09.356
(footsteps thudding)

12:10.504 --> 12:13.410
(door unlatching)

12:13.410 --> 12:14.680
- He'll be here soon,

12:14.680 --> 12:17.030
I suggest you eat something
before they arrive.

12:17.950 --> 12:19.240
Suit yourself,

12:19.240 --> 12:22.100
just don't complain later
when you get hungry.

12:28.525 --> 12:31.480

12:31.480 --> 12:33.470
- You have the girl right here?

12:33.470 --> 12:36.503
- You have got work to
get finished beforehand.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.030
- And you are nothing but a slave driver,

12:41.030 --> 12:42.180
and to think I pay you.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.050
- You'd be lost without me.

12:45.050 --> 12:47.600
Keeping organized has never
been your strong point.

12:49.010 --> 12:50.943
- Valentine's daughter.
- Anna.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.800
- Keep her back from me.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.123
- You sure that's wise?

12:58.560 --> 13:01.380
- I've always had a soft
spot for pretty blondes.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.450
- Mm-hmm, and so do our clients.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.360
You need to stop mixing
business with pleasure.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.060
Anyway, they're ready for viewing.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.883
Once you've cleared your desk,
I'll allow you to join us.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.547
- You're a strict woman, Margaret.

13:17.547 --> 13:21.350
- And that is why we have such
a good business relationship.

13:21.350 --> 13:24.783
I like to keep everything,
and everyone in order.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.700
- My guests here yet?

13:29.700 --> 13:32.850
- [Margaret] Two of them,
they're being looked after.

13:32.850 --> 13:35.187
- Good, were you expecting any more?

13:35.187 --> 13:36.830
- No, not today.

13:36.830 --> 13:38.520
Well, seeing we have a fresh consignment,

13:38.520 --> 13:41.430
we're just waiting for their response.

13:41.430 --> 13:42.750
- You think they'll buy it.

13:42.750 --> 13:43.600
- I'd imagine so,

13:44.680 --> 13:47.803
as long as you keep your
hands off the merchandise.

13:49.260 --> 13:52.290
- Well, I did it have a good quarter,

13:52.290 --> 13:54.560
I say we can ease our
foot off the gas pedal

13:54.560 --> 13:56.550
a little bit this month.

13:56.550 --> 13:58.130
Now that Valentine's off the radar,

13:58.130 --> 14:00.230
it's gonna be a lot easier to do business.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.720
- At the end of the day,
I work for you, Samuel.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.053
I'll do whatever you ask.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.230
- I love it when you say that

14:12.989 --> 14:15.224
- Well, you have 10
minutes to finish this lot,

14:15.224 --> 14:16.607
and then I'll come and get you.

14:18.310 --> 14:20.781
(Samuel sighing)

14:20.781 --> 14:23.227
(door unlatching)
(footsteps thudding)

14:23.227 --> 14:25.894
(door latching)

14:31.590 --> 14:32.940
I'll be ready for you soon.

14:37.020 --> 14:40.110
I hope you're not gonna behave
like this with our guests.

14:40.110 --> 14:42.060
They've come a long way to see you,

14:42.060 --> 14:44.160
and they're willing to pay a lot of money.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.693
- You've got no idea what
you've gotten yourself into,

14:48.693 --> 14:50.170
have you?

14:50.170 --> 14:51.960
- Talking in riddles again.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.400
- When my father finds
out, I've been taken,

14:54.400 --> 14:57.500
you're going to find
yourself in a lot of trouble.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.290
- Do you think the other girls
don't say the same thing?

15:00.290 --> 15:03.030
You need to understand we've
been doing this a long time,

15:03.030 --> 15:05.490
and we are very careful.

15:05.490 --> 15:07.310
- This time, it's going to be different.

15:07.310 --> 15:08.143
- How so?

15:09.660 --> 15:11.160
- You'll find out soon enough.

15:14.030 --> 15:15.530
- You're very beautiful, Anna,

15:16.600 --> 15:17.990
but I'll need to tidy you up a bit

15:17.990 --> 15:20.080
before you meet the others.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.913
- You can keep your hands off me.

15:22.830 --> 15:25.580
- It's best not to fight them, my sweet.

15:25.580 --> 15:28.620
- My advice is to just
go along for the ride.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.230
The girls who survive are the ones

15:30.230 --> 15:32.023
who play the dutiful girlfriend.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.713
You're about to start a new life.

15:35.580 --> 15:38.240
The sooner you accept your
sudden change in circumstances,

15:38.240 --> 15:39.890
the better.

15:39.890 --> 15:42.090
If you fight them,
they'll just replace you.

15:43.425 --> 15:45.940
These a rich and powerful
people we're dealing with,

15:45.940 --> 15:47.550
do you understand what I'm telling you?

15:47.550 --> 15:50.451
- I don't need your advice.
- I'm trying to help you.

15:50.451 --> 15:53.210
- (sneers) Cut my ropes,
and help me that way.

15:53.210 --> 15:55.260
- And risk losing my own life?

15:55.260 --> 15:57.420
There are limits to my kindness.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.830
- I'm surprised you even sleep at night.

15:59.830 --> 16:03.760
- I play my role, now I
have everything I want.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.363
I suggest you do the same.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.633
- I'd rather die than lose my soul.

16:12.467 --> 16:13.580
(slap thudding)

16:13.580 --> 16:15.880
- Then, you'll learn the hard way.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.400
One day, you'll understand,
I was trying to help.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.310
- I'll be long gone
before that day arrives.

16:21.310 --> 16:22.767
- That's what they all say.

16:23.651 --> 16:25.208
- This time, it's going to be different.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.366
- They all say that too.

16:27.366 --> 16:31.341
- You're going to die, I
want you to understand that.

16:31.341 --> 16:33.669
- I don't frighten easily.

16:33.669 --> 16:38.064
- (chuckles) That's what they all say.

16:38.064 --> 16:43.064
(birds chirping)
(tense dramatic music)

17:16.810 --> 17:18.060
- I'm sorry, have we met?

17:19.328 --> 17:21.078
- I don't believe so.

17:22.380 --> 17:25.080
- I would have remembered
your face in this little town.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.230
- I arrived last night.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.403
- I see.
- My name's Kit.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.043
- Simone.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.500
- Sorry, you just remind
me of somebody I once knew.

17:37.330 --> 17:39.323
- Someone nice I hope.
- Very much so.

17:42.159 --> 17:43.950
- Are you here for work, Kit?

17:43.950 --> 17:45.050
- Something like that.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.760
- Well, it's lovely meeting you.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
I should run along now.
- Well, perhaps

17:52.150 --> 17:53.050
we can meet again.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.633
- Yes, I'd like that.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.260
I often take a stroll in the evenings

17:58.260 --> 18:00.093
in one of the local parks.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.520
- Do you have a favorite book?

18:03.420 --> 18:05.470
I'd be interested in making a new friend.

18:08.450 --> 18:10.413
- Maybe Queens park this evening.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.253
Eight might be a good time to try.

18:23.125 --> 18:27.410
(tense ominous music)
(guest yawning)

18:27.410 --> 18:29.893
- I really hope they don't
keep us waiting here all day.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.972
- They're usually very punctual.

18:33.972 --> 18:36.103
- I paid enough money,
I bloody well hope so.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.728
- This is my third time.

18:39.728 --> 18:42.773
The quality is very good, my friend.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.547
- Stand there, and
smile, I guess to say it.

18:54.470 --> 18:55.970
Our guest is here.

18:56.980 --> 18:57.813
- Wonder.

18:58.740 --> 18:59.573
- Blimey.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.650
- [Margaret] How nice of you to join us.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.460
- Your team has done well this time.

19:25.761 --> 19:27.678
- [Margaret] Thank you.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.863
- And a very warm welcome to you both.

19:33.710 --> 19:35.980
- The pleasure's all ours.

19:35.980 --> 19:39.090
- Trust you both are happy.
- Absolutely.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.333
- Would you care for a
drink before we start?

19:42.910 --> 19:46.193
- Just a glass of water
for me, I'm a teetotaler.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.740
- Very well.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.550
- [Margaret] Drinks are on their way.

19:51.550 --> 19:53.010
- Thank you, Margaret.

19:56.518 --> 19:58.460
A bite to eat perhaps?

19:58.460 --> 20:00.580
- I have already eaten.

20:00.580 --> 20:01.413
- Very well.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.573
- I'm very impressed, Samuel.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.483
You have exceeded yourself this time.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.500
- Well, we went out of our way

20:13.500 --> 20:15.943
to bring you the very best quality.

20:18.270 --> 20:20.287
We went through a great
deal of trouble (sighs).

20:23.134 --> 20:25.801
(Anna grunting)

20:27.550 --> 20:30.310
- I'm so glad you're both happy.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.360
Can't tell you how pleased that makes me.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.193
- So we'll start the bidding.

20:37.037 --> 20:38.787
I say we get this show on the road.

20:40.090 --> 20:40.923
- Cool.

21:00.556 --> 21:03.639
(footsteps thudding)

21:15.840 --> 21:17.390
- I didn't think you'd show up.

21:20.842 --> 21:22.342
- I'm not that kind of person.

21:23.420 --> 21:26.370
I would never agree to meet
someone, then not show.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.870
Wouldn't want that done to me.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.000
- You seem upset, are you okay?

21:38.290 --> 21:40.150
- You're staring at me.

21:40.150 --> 21:42.580
- I'm sorry, you just remind
me of someone very special.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.730
You look just like her.

21:45.580 --> 21:46.563
- Your girlfriend?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.453
- My wife, she was very beautiful.

21:50.530 --> 21:51.363
- I see.

21:52.370 --> 21:53.323
Did she leave you?

21:54.280 --> 21:56.030
- Well, you could put it that way (sighs).

21:56.030 --> 21:57.030
- I don't understand

21:59.620 --> 22:00.570
- She was murdered.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.950
- Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.583
I can't imagine what you
must be going through.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.670
- You learn to cope with it.

22:09.670 --> 22:10.503
- I couldn't.

22:12.349 --> 22:13.182
- (sighs) Anyway.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.600
Why are you so unhappy?

22:17.700 --> 22:18.853
- Nothing, I,

22:20.680 --> 22:23.230
I just haven't heard back
from my friend today, so.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.110
- I'm sure they'll call.

22:27.310 --> 22:28.927
- Yes, I expect they will.

22:33.113 --> 22:34.373
- I've lost you.

22:35.460 --> 22:36.293
- Sorry.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.940
- You look so deep in thought.

22:40.372 --> 22:42.740
- (chuckles) I was thinking of my wife.

22:42.740 --> 22:43.573
- I understand.

22:44.970 --> 22:47.853
- One day, I'll find the
man that took her life.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.593
- Perhaps that man is out
there looking for you too.

22:53.670 --> 22:54.553
- Oh, I hope so.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.880
- It's not healthy to
hold in all that anger.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.770
- It's what keeps me alive.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.600
- It could end up costing you it.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.137
- I'll take my chances (sighs).

23:12.610 --> 23:14.060
I'm sure your friend'll call.

23:15.422 --> 23:17.982
- You know I wasn't thinking about that.

23:17.982 --> 23:21.640
I was thinking of.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.100
I was thinking that it
would be wise for you

23:24.100 --> 23:26.800
to leave this town as soon
as possible, Mr. Valentine.

23:29.850 --> 23:31.000
- Care you explain why?

23:32.780 --> 23:35.470
- Sometimes you just can't fight back,

23:35.470 --> 23:37.270
not when they have something on you.

23:38.124 --> 23:40.457
- I'm not sure I follow you.

23:43.877 --> 23:44.903
Are you leaving?

23:49.260 --> 23:50.960
- I have a lot to do this evening.

23:53.310 --> 23:54.143
- I see.

23:54.990 --> 23:56.690
- It was lovely meeting you again.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.871
I wish it would have been
under better circumstances.

24:01.871 --> 24:03.760
- The feeling is mutual.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.670
- You're very peculiar,
man, Mr. Valentine.

24:06.670 --> 24:09.103
- Unusual circumstances
can do that to someone.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.273
- You take care.

24:12.770 --> 24:15.070
I hope you enjoy your
stay in our lovely town,

24:16.280 --> 24:18.230
and I hope someday you find a new love.

24:19.768 --> 24:22.568
- Oh, just when I was beginning
to enjoy my own company.

24:23.550 --> 24:27.433
- You'll find love again
when you least expect it.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.400
Goodbye, Mr. Valentine.

24:43.396 --> 24:48.396
(door unlatching)
(footsteps thudding)

24:50.466 --> 24:53.049
(gun clanking)

24:59.557 --> 25:02.057
(Kit sighing)

25:27.567 --> 25:29.706
- Do you make a habit
of seducing married men?

25:29.706 --> 25:31.840
(Anna chuckling)

25:31.840 --> 25:33.240
- Just when I have the time.

25:37.860 --> 25:38.693
- Why me?

25:40.000 --> 25:40.957
- Why not you?

25:44.471 --> 25:46.570
- I hope you're going to untie me after.

25:46.570 --> 25:49.179
- I won't have to soon.

25:49.179 --> 25:52.012
(knife whooshing)

25:53.870 --> 25:57.826
(door unlatching)
(door creaking)

25:57.826 --> 26:00.493
(door latching)

26:02.796 --> 26:03.629
- Anna?

26:06.208 --> 26:10.610
Anna?
(door unlatching)

26:10.610 --> 26:11.443
- Father?

26:13.080 --> 26:14.840
- We agreed not to do this again.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.673
- I'm sorry.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.360
- You're promised (pants)!

26:18.360 --> 26:22.610
- You are so weak, Dad, I can't
bear to see you like this.

26:22.610 --> 26:24.380
- It'll pass, you know it'll pass.

26:24.380 --> 26:27.491
- I couldn't stand it, it's
killing me to see you suffer.

26:27.491 --> 26:28.910
- We need to clear this mess
up, before mother gets back.

26:28.910 --> 26:30.470
- Yeah, leave it to me,

26:30.470 --> 26:33.340
I'll have it spotless
before she gets back.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.350
- This has to be the last time.

26:35.350 --> 26:37.240
- You have to feed.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.330
- This has to be the last
time we do this, Anna.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.493
Do you understand?

26:41.590 --> 26:43.760
- Daddy, you know I'd do anything for you.

26:43.760 --> 26:47.300
- I'm serious, this has to stop.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.233
This is our home, our sanctuary.

26:50.950 --> 26:51.800
- I know (sighs).

26:58.566 --> 27:01.886
(person knocking)

27:01.886 --> 27:03.030
- Who is it?

27:03.030 --> 27:03.863
- It's me.

27:05.378 --> 27:07.878
(Kit sighing)

27:08.859 --> 27:11.240
(light clicking)

27:11.240 --> 27:13.740
(Kit sighing)

27:15.065 --> 27:16.777
(door unlatching)

27:16.777 --> 27:17.610
Boo.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.390
You really know how to
impress a girl, Kit.

27:24.384 --> 27:27.051
(door latching)

27:30.260 --> 27:32.160
- Did you follow me?

27:32.160 --> 27:32.993
- I did.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
- Could you get me a drink?

27:37.040 --> 27:37.873
I'd like one.

27:40.356 --> 27:43.083
(bottle clanking)

27:43.083 --> 27:44.220
A glass would be nice.

27:44.220 --> 27:45.370
- Don't push your luck.

27:47.370 --> 27:50.453
- Take a seat, I just
might share this with you.

27:55.032 --> 27:56.632
- I don't really know you, do I?

27:58.780 --> 28:02.503
- That's funny, I was just
thinking the same thing.

28:06.254 --> 28:08.360
(Kit sighing)

28:08.360 --> 28:11.663
- Have you lived here now long?

28:11.663 --> 28:12.496
- Long enough.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.470
- Didn't want to explore?

28:15.470 --> 28:16.820
It's a big world out there.

28:18.690 --> 28:21.640
- You wouldn't ask that if you
knew how this town operated.

28:23.020 --> 28:24.685
- People run away all the time, were

28:24.685 --> 28:26.153
what makes this town so special?

28:28.255 --> 28:29.088
- If only you knew.

28:30.420 --> 28:33.363
Look, I didn't come
here to be interrogated.

28:34.410 --> 28:37.030
So let's just stop with all the questions.

28:37.030 --> 28:38.998
- What did you come here for?

28:38.998 --> 28:41.182
(person knocking)

28:41.182 --> 28:43.349
- Well, someone's popular.

28:46.426 --> 28:51.426
- Who is it?

28:51.524 --> 28:53.543
- Who the hell are you?

28:53.543 --> 28:54.873
- I said, who is it?

29:03.000 --> 29:03.833
Yes?

29:03.833 --> 29:06.960
- Someone out there wanted
to see you urgently.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.117
- Does this person have a name?

29:09.117 --> 29:11.190
- Oh, they didn't wanna give me a name?

29:11.190 --> 29:13.200
- What does he look like?

29:13.200 --> 29:16.240
- Well, I would say he's in his early 40s,

29:16.240 --> 29:20.310
short black hair, had a stern expression.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.950
Do you know him?

29:21.950 --> 29:22.783
- Not yet.

29:24.170 --> 29:25.360
- I'm going.
- You don't have to leave,

29:25.360 --> 29:27.980
I'll be 10 minutes, wait here for me.

29:27.980 --> 29:30.457
- 10 minutes, that's all I'm giving you.

29:41.555 --> 29:43.355
(door latching)

29:43.355 --> 29:44.960
- That's quite a catch.

29:44.960 --> 29:45.793
- Not my type.

29:46.630 --> 29:49.023
- I said that about my wife 20 years ago.

29:49.970 --> 29:51.970
- Send me an anniversary card, shall we?

29:53.280 --> 29:54.113
- Follow me.

30:10.187 --> 30:12.680
- You're in a great deal
of danger, Mr. Valentine.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.130
- It's common in my line of work.

30:14.130 --> 30:16.689
- I know we both took
the same career path.

30:16.689 --> 30:17.890
- MI5?

30:17.890 --> 30:19.400
- We know why you're here.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.880
We heard about your wife and daughter too,

30:20.880 --> 30:22.643
my sincere condolences.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.340
- I'm not leaving here
until Archer's dead.

30:29.340 --> 30:31.143
- I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

30:32.679 --> 30:34.480
- I didn't catch your name.
- You can call me Marshall.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.370
- You know Edward?
- Edward did a very poor job.

30:37.370 --> 30:39.480
Your cover was blown
before you left London.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.420
Edward's first-class, I guess
I'll have to take your word

30:41.420 --> 30:42.610
on that, Marshall.

30:42.610 --> 30:44.300
- The very fact we're talking
should raise alarm bells.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.060
- What exactly do you want?
- I want you to leave town,

30:46.060 --> 30:47.930
that's what I want, I don't
care if you kill Samuel,

30:47.930 --> 30:49.990
is that clear?
- I'm not leaving here

30:49.990 --> 30:51.900
until Archer's dead, is
that clear enough for ya?

30:51.900 --> 30:53.390
- Get your business sorted this evening.

30:53.390 --> 30:55.490
We can't have dead bodies lying around.

30:55.490 --> 30:57.090
- I'll even send a chap to
pick you up if you like,

30:57.090 --> 30:58.130
I'm very friendly that way.

30:58.130 --> 31:00.300
- I'll make my own way if
it's all the same to you.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.793
- Well, that's fine, I wish
you the very best of British.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.770
Oh, by the way, the station
serves a very fine coffee,

31:06.770 --> 31:09.020
I'd take advantage of
that fact if I were you

31:11.927 --> 31:15.010
(footsteps thudding)

31:46.479 --> 31:49.312
(person knocking)

31:55.534 --> 32:00.534
(door unlatching)
(door squeaking)

32:03.095 --> 32:08.095
- Is anyone here?
(door latching)

32:08.695 --> 32:09.645
I have your parcel.

32:17.540 --> 32:20.160
Is there someone there?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.510
- You're five minutes late.

32:23.619 --> 32:26.780
- (stammers) I'm sorry,
I got stuck in traffic.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.477
- Put the parcel on the floor.

32:34.078 --> 32:36.290
(deliveryman thudding)
(deliveryman grunting)

32:36.290 --> 32:38.670
- Well, that's wasn't very polite of ya.

32:38.670 --> 32:41.510
- I'm about do a spot of decorating.

32:41.510 --> 32:44.203
I was thinking dark red
would suit this room.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.540
Don't you want to know
what's in the parcel?

32:48.540 --> 32:49.990
- Look, I'm just Here
to earn a few pounds.

32:49.990 --> 32:52.133
I don't need to know
what's in that parcel.

32:54.285 --> 32:57.285
(package rummaging)

32:58.340 --> 32:59.173
- You like it?

33:00.240 --> 33:01.463
- What's it for?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.290
- It's for your blood.

33:05.290 --> 33:06.819
- Excuse me?

33:06.819 --> 33:09.986
(deliveryman gagging)

33:12.322 --> 33:16.250
(speaking in a foreign language)

33:16.250 --> 33:18.403
- Deep breath and count to 10, my lovely.

33:19.713 --> 33:24.713
(deliveryman grunting)
(deliveryman choking)

33:32.895 --> 33:35.562
(blood pouring)

33:44.240 --> 33:49.240
- Fantastic, the finest in adrenochrome.

33:50.639 --> 33:54.010
(speaking in a foreign language)

33:54.010 --> 33:57.090
Samuel will pay big money for this.

33:57.090 --> 33:59.080
- Forget about Samuel.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.453
Go to Martin direct, and
cut out the middleman,

34:02.320 --> 34:03.793
we'll make so much more.

34:05.660 --> 34:06.563
- Good point.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.712
(speaking in a foreign language)

34:11.712 --> 34:14.462
(lips smooching)

34:21.262 --> 34:24.345
(footsteps thudding)

34:26.210 --> 34:27.043
- Well?

34:28.672 --> 34:29.505
- I tried to warn him off.

34:29.505 --> 34:32.000
- And did he take your advice?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.410
- Would you listen if I killed
a member of your family?

34:34.410 --> 34:36.510
- So we get rid of him.

34:36.510 --> 34:37.840
- It's beginning to look that way?

34:37.840 --> 34:39.240
- I think it's for the best.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.360
- You still got my back?

34:42.500 --> 34:43.333
- Always

34:49.028 --> 34:52.111
(footsteps thudding)

35:35.480 --> 35:37.420
- Afternoon.
- Jesus.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.000
- Are you really the best they could find?

35:39.000 --> 35:39.883
- Excuse me?

35:40.754 --> 35:42.250
(Bobby grunting)
- I'd stop moving

35:42.250 --> 35:43.930
if I was you.
- I am late

35:43.930 --> 35:45.250
for an appointment.

35:45.250 --> 35:46.900
- Who with?
- My doctor.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.130
- Well, you look fine to me.

35:48.130 --> 35:51.860
- Well, looks can be deceiving,
I have a heart condition,

35:51.860 --> 35:55.880
and if it goes checked
out (grunts), I could die.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.580
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

35:57.580 --> 36:00.110
Who sent you to follow me?
- You're hurting me.

36:00.110 --> 36:04.140
- I don't care.
(Bobby squirming)

36:04.140 --> 36:06.070
- Marshall sent me, Marshall.

36:06.070 --> 36:08.930
- Marshall, well that does surprise me.

36:08.930 --> 36:12.563
I held him in higher esteem.
(Bobby panting)

36:13.840 --> 36:16.100
- You're not going to
kill me now, are you?

36:16.100 --> 36:17.643
- You're not worth killing,

36:17.643 --> 36:19.630
I'll feel embarrassed taking your life.

36:19.630 --> 36:20.463
- I agree.

36:23.130 --> 36:24.130
Can I go now?

36:24.130 --> 36:25.280
- You're free to leave.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.410
- Is there anything else you
would like me to tell Marshall?

36:30.410 --> 36:33.030
- Yeah, tell him to back off.

36:33.030 --> 36:35.740
I'm not the sort of man that
likes to be put in a corner.

36:35.740 --> 36:38.483
- Sure, it was nice meeting you,

36:39.993 --> 36:42.870
and I certainly hope that you
find what you're looking for.

36:42.870 --> 36:43.970
- Oh, I'm sure I will.

36:50.523 --> 36:53.440
(car horn honking)

36:56.523 --> 36:59.810
(Kit sighing)

36:59.810 --> 37:00.993
- The lady left.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.250
- You should have been a detective.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.930
- [Owner] She gave me
this note to give to ya.

37:08.930 --> 37:09.973
- How sweet of her.

37:11.025 --> 37:12.247
- [Owner] You want to read it or not?

37:13.410 --> 37:15.710
- Why not, I could do
with some entertainment.

37:18.678 --> 37:20.063
Is there something I can do for you.

37:20.914 --> 37:23.430
- Well, it's just, I wondered
if you wanted a bite to eat.

37:23.430 --> 37:26.096
Kitchen's been open for over an hour.

37:26.096 --> 37:26.946
- I'm not hungry.

37:27.860 --> 37:29.860
- We get a lot of our income from meals.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.350
I think you can probably understand

37:32.350 --> 37:35.493
in a small town like this one,
we don't get too many guests.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.130
- I'll drop by the local food bank.

37:39.130 --> 37:40.980
Rustle up a couple of guests for you.

37:43.088 --> 37:44.710
- You've got an answer for
everything, haven't ya?

37:44.710 --> 37:45.543
- I try.

37:46.770 --> 37:48.913
- Well, I'll be downstairs if you need me,

37:49.777 --> 37:52.833
the kitchen's open until
10 just so you know.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.033
- Appreciate it.

38:03.437 --> 38:08.437
(footsteps thudding)
(paper rummaging)

38:25.165 --> 38:27.915
(drill whirring)

38:36.340 --> 38:37.290
- Any updates?

38:39.667 --> 38:40.834
- We have him.

38:46.304 --> 38:47.137
Oh gross..

38:48.610 --> 38:50.810
He's in a safe house with Sasha,

38:50.810 --> 38:53.307
and the rest of the gang
as we speak (sighs).

38:54.313 --> 38:55.146
- Good work.

38:56.630 --> 38:58.610
- You look exhausted.

38:58.610 --> 38:59.930
Can I pour you a drink?

39:01.380 --> 39:02.230
- I won't say no.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.523
- [Marshall] I need to
get him straight away.

39:09.735 --> 39:12.135
- I think Finchy would
want a play at him first?

39:13.390 --> 39:14.840
- He needs to be killed ASAP.

39:16.070 --> 39:16.970
- What's the rush?

39:17.970 --> 39:19.620
- Sasha knows where he's staying.

39:21.057 --> 39:22.930
- You got no idea what
you're playing with.

39:25.368 --> 39:28.118
(Brian laughing)

39:30.623 --> 39:31.706
I don't care.

39:33.380 --> 39:34.413
I've done my job.

39:35.450 --> 39:37.310
I found the guy, spring him in,

39:37.310 --> 39:38.810
and now, I just want my money.

39:41.730 --> 39:45.920
You said I could have
a little extra reward

39:48.180 --> 39:51.453
if I was a good boy, and did a good job.

39:52.780 --> 39:55.160
- I think you've earned
a bit of play time.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.320
- What do you say, Michelle?

39:57.320 --> 40:01.410
- You're the boss, I just do as I'm told.

40:01.410 --> 40:02.243
- Good to know.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.890
You've got 10 minutes.
- I need longer.

40:05.890 --> 40:07.540
- 10 minutes, or we kick you out.

40:17.407 --> 40:19.907
(Kit panting)

40:22.464 --> 40:24.130
- Kit!

40:24.130 --> 40:24.973
Kit, wake up!

40:26.010 --> 40:29.090
Wake up, kit!
(Kit grunting)

40:29.090 --> 40:30.013
Don't fight it.

40:30.860 --> 40:32.330
- Where am I?

40:32.330 --> 40:35.483
- I'm trying to stop them,
I begged them to let you go.

40:35.483 --> 40:37.390
- Dave your tears, I'm not interested.

40:37.390 --> 40:39.683
- Believe me.
- Where am I?

40:44.196 --> 40:46.270
- A house belonging to Samuel.

40:46.270 --> 40:50.010
- Samuel Archer, so you work for him too.

40:50.010 --> 40:51.580
- I won't let them kill you.

40:51.580 --> 40:52.670
- Oh, I won't die that easily.

40:52.670 --> 40:54.320
You'll find that out soon enough.

40:55.330 --> 40:57.890
- I told them to leave you alone.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.340
- You didn't try hard enough.

41:01.520 --> 41:02.870
- Everybody wants you dead,

41:03.870 --> 41:05.670
Archer runs everything in this town.

41:07.110 --> 41:08.810
- I had a feeling you knew Archer.

41:09.650 --> 41:11.753
I came here to kill him.

41:14.010 --> 41:14.843
- Why?

41:15.900 --> 41:17.740
- Oh, don't play dumb.

41:17.740 --> 41:20.340
He's in possession of
something very valuable to me,

41:21.282 --> 41:22.115
and I think you know everything

41:22.115 --> 41:24.610
that's going on in this little town .

41:24.610 --> 41:26.760
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.983
- Your little gang took my only daughter.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.460
- I wasn't involved in that.

41:38.710 --> 41:40.043
- And the other girls?

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
- My younger sister.

41:49.850 --> 41:52.490
You have no idea how deep this goes.

41:53.570 --> 41:55.650
- Oh, I understand very well.

41:55.650 --> 41:57.153
See it's my job to understand.

41:58.050 --> 42:00.313
They just stole from
the wrong guy this time.

42:02.430 --> 42:03.383
Nothing to say?

42:05.940 --> 42:08.970
- You should've left this
town when you had the chance.

42:08.970 --> 42:10.293
- Where it's Archer?

42:11.540 --> 42:12.373
Simone?

42:18.520 --> 42:21.073
- You don't know what you've walked into.

42:21.073 --> 42:22.323
- I asked you a question.

42:25.570 --> 42:26.970
- This is a very small town,

42:29.199 --> 42:30.883
and there are many people involved.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.510
- I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

42:40.580 --> 42:43.170
- I don't think there's
anything I can do for you now.

42:43.170 --> 42:45.540
- Well, you could untie
my hands for a start.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.543
Just as I thought.

42:54.570 --> 42:58.423
- If I get you out of here,
will you take me with you?

43:04.120 --> 43:06.220
Will you take me far away from this place?

43:12.070 --> 43:15.283
I think that I would go anywhere with you.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.520
- I'm not the man you think I am?

43:20.520 --> 43:22.020
- Let me be the judge of that.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.590
- I think you're a good soul.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.473
- Simone.

43:28.636 --> 43:33.636
(door unlatching)
(footsteps thudding)

43:38.321 --> 43:40.988
(Bobby sighing)

43:43.700 --> 43:45.683
- I'm sorry it had to end like this.

43:47.880 --> 43:48.713
- Edward?

43:49.701 --> 43:51.901
- You were getting far
too good at your job.

43:52.820 --> 43:54.910
You were beginning to cost us.

43:54.910 --> 43:55.743
- Cost you?

43:57.040 --> 43:59.490
- I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.813
- You caught me on a bad day.

44:04.910 --> 44:06.110
- I'm not afraid of you.

44:07.330 --> 44:08.163
- Just wait.

44:09.350 --> 44:11.200
- We knew you'd follow your daughter.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.070
- Archer bought you off?

44:15.070 --> 44:17.253
- Archer buys everybody off.

44:18.410 --> 44:21.283
We were making a killing
'til you showed up.

44:23.100 --> 44:26.333
Human trafficking is a
very lucrative business.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.650
- You won't see your daughter again?

44:38.650 --> 44:40.172
- You're gonna pay for that.

44:40.172 --> 44:43.370
(Sasha laughing)

44:43.370 --> 44:47.170
- I don't think you're in
any position to make threats.

44:47.170 --> 44:48.623
- Mr. Archer is not happy.

44:51.170 --> 44:53.940
His men found Mark's body

44:54.890 --> 44:57.197
You really do have to disappear.

45:00.343 --> 45:02.091
(punch thudding)
(Kit grunting)

45:02.091 --> 45:04.180
(Bobby laughing)

45:04.180 --> 45:06.580
- Not such a tough guy
anymore, are ya (laughs)?

45:07.810 --> 45:10.973
- Leave, Mr. Valentine alone,
Bobby, there's a good chap.

45:13.130 --> 45:15.690
- What did you do with my daughter?

45:15.690 --> 45:17.790
- You really have to ask.

45:17.790 --> 45:20.320
She was stolen to order, Kit.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.810
- And we got a good price for her too.

45:22.810 --> 45:24.913
- I am gonna rip your heart out.

45:25.830 --> 45:28.470
- Oh, Anna was so young and beautiful.

45:28.470 --> 45:29.610
- Satanic ritual?

45:29.610 --> 45:33.220
- We're not the gang that
steals girls like her to order,

45:33.220 --> 45:35.710
but then you should know this.

45:35.710 --> 45:39.150
It was your job to track such gangs.

45:39.150 --> 45:42.173
- I was selected especially
to hunt people like you.

45:44.613 --> 45:48.770
- We know that, you're the
best, that's why you had to go.

45:50.460 --> 45:51.323
Interpol.

45:53.988 --> 45:56.670
MI%, they all take a juicy cuts,

45:56.670 --> 45:59.770
you were beginning to rock
a very lucrative blunt.

45:59.770 --> 46:01.380
- That's not what I meant.

46:01.380 --> 46:04.640
I was chosen for other
reasons, specific reasons.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.660
- And what might they be?

46:06.660 --> 46:08.580
- Gangs like yours,

46:08.580 --> 46:10.793
beginning to tread on our toes too.

46:13.163 --> 46:14.213
- I don't follow you.

46:15.290 --> 46:19.830
- My people have a taste for fresh blood.

46:19.830 --> 46:21.360
- Your people?

46:21.360 --> 46:24.517
- You're not the only secret
society that operates with MI5.

46:26.010 --> 46:28.923
Only we've been around
for a very long time.

46:37.300 --> 46:39.223
- No, you're just talking in riddles.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.773
- [Sasha] She was very pretty.

46:47.666 --> 46:48.499
(Kit sighing)

46:48.499 --> 46:51.583
- Sasha, be quiet, this
doesn't have to get ugly.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.253
This is only business.

46:58.460 --> 46:59.910
These thing's never personal.

47:04.024 --> 47:05.850
You were ruining our business,

47:05.850 --> 47:08.120
we had to find some way to lure you here,

47:08.120 --> 47:12.220
plus we've got to make
cash from Anna's sale.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.890
It was a win-win situation.

47:14.890 --> 47:15.757
- Where is she?

47:17.638 --> 47:21.130
- Oh, it really doesn't matter now.

47:21.130 --> 47:22.960
- Tell me where my daughter is.

47:22.960 --> 47:25.141
- I'm afraid you're far too late,

47:25.141 --> 47:26.820
your daughter is dead, Mr. Valentine.

47:26.820 --> 47:28.520
Let that be the end of the matter.

47:30.070 --> 47:32.800
Now, I shall spare you
the gruesome details.

47:32.800 --> 47:35.942
- Oh, I'm sure you know
what these groups get up to.

47:35.942 --> 47:38.775
(Edward chuckles)

47:40.420 --> 47:41.253
Anyway,

47:42.120 --> 47:44.113
I did my homework.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.130
She's not even your real daughter, is she?

47:49.950 --> 47:52.113
Can't you have children, Mr. Valentine.

47:53.730 --> 47:55.520
- By choice.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.210
- Choice?
- Bad blood.

47:57.210 --> 47:58.043
- Oh.

47:59.100 --> 48:02.223
- I am going to kill you all.

48:03.657 --> 48:05.007
- Well, so you keep saying.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.270
Though I'm sure under
normal circumstances,

48:09.270 --> 48:11.895
we'd all be in a great deal of trouble.

48:11.895 --> 48:14.478
(all laughing)

48:15.990 --> 48:17.310
- I'll be trying to make your passing

48:17.310 --> 48:18.970
as painless as possible.

48:18.970 --> 48:21.180
Believe me when I tell you,

48:21.180 --> 48:24.760
I take no pleasure in
killing a fellow agent,

48:24.760 --> 48:26.463
especially one as good as you.

48:32.060 --> 48:34.487
- [Kit] You get your dirty hands off me.

48:34.487 --> 48:35.820
[Sasha Laughing]

48:38.960 --> 48:40.643
- This is going to hurt a lot.

48:42.420 --> 48:47.380
I will do my best to cause
as much pain as possible.

48:47.380 --> 48:50.460
- [Edward] Sasha, just
get on with it, will you?

48:50.460 --> 48:52.990
- Just having a little fun, my love.

48:52.990 --> 48:54.757
You always spoil my fun (laughs).

48:56.420 --> 48:59.483
- I am looking so forward
to watching you die.

49:01.246 --> 49:02.380
(laughs) I'm gonna get a lot.

49:02.380 --> 49:05.283
Oh, I'm gonna get a lot
of pleasure out of this.

49:07.341 --> 49:08.591
- I'm so sorry.

49:51.323 --> 49:53.990
(woman panting)

50:00.829 --> 50:01.662
- Why?

50:04.575 --> 50:08.365
Why are they doing this (sobs)?

50:08.365 --> 50:12.532
(speaking in a foreign language)

50:22.203 --> 50:24.793
Why are you taking me away from my family?

50:26.359 --> 50:29.753
- I'm going to see the boss
now, I'll ask him for you.

50:31.101 --> 50:33.851
- (sobs) please.

50:35.168 --> 50:39.723
(speaking in a foreign language)

50:39.723 --> 50:44.640
(sobs) Please (whimpers).

50:50.285 --> 50:52.868
(sobs) Please.

50:55.288 --> 50:57.455
I have a daughter, please.

50:58.646 --> 51:03.146
Take me away from here please (sobs).

51:40.554 --> 51:45.137
No, please (sobs), no, please, please.

51:50.643 --> 51:54.226
Please, please, no (sobs).

51:57.370 --> 52:00.287
No, please (sobs).

52:01.186 --> 52:05.401
Please, don't, no, no (sobs).

52:05.401 --> 52:10.401
(bones crushing)
No (sobs).

52:21.215 --> 52:25.132
- It's rude to point (laughs).

52:36.279 --> 52:39.029
(lips smooching)

52:44.050 --> 52:47.133
Ciao bella (laughs).

52:48.444 --> 52:51.111
(woman sobbing)

52:52.679 --> 52:54.841
(Mario laughing)

52:54.841 --> 52:58.008
(car engine growling)

53:15.140 --> 53:17.553
- I hope to serve you well this evening.

53:23.102 --> 53:28.102
(chalice thudding)
(Samuel sighing)

53:28.267 --> 53:31.100
(Samuel slurping)

53:37.039 --> 53:40.122
(footsteps thudding)

53:48.750 --> 53:51.200
- The other girl fetched a good price.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.473
Clients were very happy.

53:54.705 --> 53:57.455
(Samuel sighing)

53:58.630 --> 54:00.630
- This will make us wealthy too one day.

54:02.090 --> 54:04.933
- She'll have to change her
attitude before that can happen.

54:08.060 --> 54:09.827
- She'll earn us some men.

54:09.827 --> 54:11.473
- You'll have a long wait.

54:12.890 --> 54:15.950
- She's spirited, we have
clients who like that.

54:15.950 --> 54:17.223
- Go to hell.

54:19.210 --> 54:20.060
- That's my goal.

54:21.490 --> 54:22.493
- [Margaret] What shall we do with her?

54:23.330 --> 54:25.210
- She'll come with me.

54:25.210 --> 54:26.883
Finish your shift for the evening.

54:29.820 --> 54:30.653
- Very well.

54:33.460 --> 54:35.320
- Do you have any work left to complete?

54:35.320 --> 54:36.220
- Bits and pieces.

54:38.770 --> 54:41.083
- I'll leave the keys with
you if that's the case.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.193
- Fine, hope you sleep well tonight?

54:47.770 --> 54:48.720
- I'm sure I will.

54:50.845 --> 54:53.690
(Samuel panting)
(Samuel grunting)

54:53.690 --> 54:55.250
- Are you gonna give me any trouble?

54:55.250 --> 54:57.360
- It's not me you have to worry about.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.021
- What does that mean?

54:59.021 --> 55:00.271
- You'll see soon enough.

55:01.810 --> 55:03.410
I'll see you tomorrow, Margaret.

55:05.116 --> 55:08.199
(footsteps thudding)

55:14.910 --> 55:16.810
- I'm so sorry it had to end this way.

55:17.823 --> 55:22.823
(footsteps thudding)
(Kit sighing)

55:24.840 --> 55:27.623
- What is it like knowing
that you're about to die?

55:29.170 --> 55:30.370
- I wouldn't be so sure.

55:32.610 --> 55:34.370
- I admire your courage.

55:34.370 --> 55:35.883
I will say that much for you.

55:37.360 --> 55:40.600
Hey, do you mind?

55:40.600 --> 55:42.960
I was just talking to this lovely man.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.563
- Keep your distance, Bitch.

55:45.810 --> 55:48.620
- That's no way to talk to a close friend.

55:48.620 --> 55:50.843
I'm sure he wasn't
raised to talk that way.

55:51.729 --> 55:52.562
You should be ashamed.

55:52.562 --> 55:53.860
- I said keep your distance.

55:53.860 --> 55:55.550
- And if I don't?

55:55.550 --> 55:57.498
- Then I'll scratch your eyes out.

55:57.498 --> 55:59.171
(Sasha laughing)

55:59.171 --> 56:00.873
- Well,

56:02.336 --> 56:04.850
I will leave you with your man, Simone.

56:04.850 --> 56:07.203
I advise you two enjoy every last second.

56:08.070 --> 56:10.660
He won't be around for much longer.

56:10.660 --> 56:13.690
- One more word, Sasha, one more,

56:13.690 --> 56:15.493
and I swear to God, I will kill you.

56:22.372 --> 56:24.910
- That thing I needed to tell you.

56:24.910 --> 56:26.360
- I'm not interested, Simone.

56:27.990 --> 56:30.225
- It's about your
daughter, you need to know.

56:30.225 --> 56:31.642
- What about her?

56:37.037 --> 56:38.843
- Is she hurt, Simone?

56:40.500 --> 56:42.943
- They're lying to you, she's still alive.

56:45.383 --> 56:46.800
(Kit sighing)

56:46.800 --> 56:48.400
- She's still alive?

56:48.400 --> 56:49.233
- Very much so.

56:54.490 --> 56:55.323
Shit.

56:59.297 --> 57:01.083
Is she hurt, Simone?

57:02.010 --> 57:03.960
- They will harm her, I know that much.

57:06.410 --> 57:07.900
- Where is she?

57:07.900 --> 57:09.530
- What difference does it make it?

57:09.530 --> 57:11.430
There's nothing you can do to save her.

57:11.430 --> 57:13.520
- Tell me where they're
keeping my daughter.

57:13.520 --> 57:14.353
- Hey,

57:16.360 --> 57:17.193
move.

57:20.549 --> 57:21.650
You know Mr. Valentine,

57:21.650 --> 57:25.493
I sure hope it takes a
long time for you to die.

57:29.140 --> 57:30.533
- It's not my time to die.

57:31.873 --> 57:32.973
- Oh, really (laughs)?

57:35.240 --> 57:36.640
What makes you so sure?

57:36.640 --> 57:38.903
- Don't torment him.
- Quiet.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.310
I asked you a question.

57:45.890 --> 57:48.247
- You, you should be very afraid (pants)!

57:49.610 --> 57:51.500
(Bobby laughing)

57:51.500 --> 57:52.400
- Afraid (laughs)?

57:53.883 --> 57:55.763
Why, why should I be afraid?

57:57.707 --> 57:58.810
(Kit panting)

57:58.810 --> 58:00.977
- Never cross a vampire.

58:02.731 --> 58:05.648
- (laughs) A what?

58:07.595 --> 58:10.234
What is happening in your face?

58:10.234 --> 58:15.234
(Kit grunting)
(Kit growling)

58:17.739 --> 58:20.186
What's happening to his face!

58:20.186 --> 58:25.186
Oh God!
(footsteps thudding)

58:30.304 --> 58:35.304
(Edward thudding)
(Edward grunting)

58:38.298 --> 58:40.798
(Kit hissing)

58:45.512 --> 58:48.345
(knife whooshing)

58:58.144 --> 59:03.144
(knife thudding)
(Edward grunting)

59:13.456 --> 59:18.456
(footsteps thudding)
(door clanking)

59:32.823 --> 59:36.156
- (pants) What are you?

59:37.436 --> 59:40.353
(plastic rustling)

59:43.632 --> 59:44.590
- You've done this before?

59:44.590 --> 59:47.330
- Once or twice each century.

59:47.330 --> 59:50.256
I'm very picky.
(Brian chuckling)

59:50.256 --> 59:51.570
- Each century?

59:51.570 --> 59:55.003
- Be quiet, and just enjoy.

59:57.052 --> 59:58.533
- (laughs) This is gonna be fun.

59:59.490 --> 1:00:00.573
- It will be.

1:00:03.139 --> 1:00:04.547
(Michelle hissing)

1:00:04.547 --> 1:00:06.630
- [Brian] What the hell
is going on (pants).

1:00:06.630 --> 1:00:10.506
- Are you having a fun time, my sweet

1:00:10.506 --> 1:00:12.506
- What the hell are you?

1:00:15.841 --> 1:00:20.674
(screams) Oh god (pits)!

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:23.620
- I like to nibble a bit (laughs).

1:00:26.093 --> 1:00:29.010
(glass shattering)

1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:38.380
- This is intolerable.

1:00:40.290 --> 1:00:41.603
Simply intolerable.

1:00:46.410 --> 1:00:47.743
Is this some kind of joke.

1:00:49.860 --> 1:00:50.890
If you're playing silly buggers,

1:00:50.890 --> 1:00:55.043
then you're messing with
the wrong woman, Jesus.

1:00:56.530 --> 1:00:59.370
- You've been a close
friend of Samuel Archer

1:00:59.370 --> 1:01:00.700
for many years now, Margaret,

1:01:00.700 --> 1:01:03.760
you really should learn
to keep better company.

1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:05.327
- What do you want?

1:01:05.327 --> 1:01:06.859
- I want to know where Samuel is.

1:01:06.859 --> 1:01:07.930
- And then?

1:01:07.930 --> 1:01:08.847
- And then?

1:01:10.490 --> 1:01:13.300
You took My daughter from me.

1:01:13.300 --> 1:01:15.800
- Daughter?
- Anna, her name is Anna.

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.003
You took her from me,

1:01:17.860 --> 1:01:19.410
and then you killed her mother.

1:01:21.626 --> 1:01:25.457
- I don't know what you mean.

1:01:25.457 --> 1:01:27.400
- You really need to leave,
it's getting late (whimpers).

1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:28.673
I need to lock up.

1:01:29.660 --> 1:01:31.610
- You've been running a
human trafficking ring

1:01:31.610 --> 1:01:32.763
for decades now.

1:01:33.630 --> 1:01:36.400
Supplying young girls to wealthy clients,

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.443
clients who dabble in the black arts.

1:01:41.483 --> 1:01:43.150
- You need to leave.

1:01:44.045 --> 1:01:45.695
You need to leave now (whimpers).

1:01:46.530 --> 1:01:48.110
You see, I know all about
your little operation.

1:01:48.110 --> 1:01:50.283
It's my job to disrupt gangs like yours.

1:01:51.660 --> 1:01:53.460
- Do you want me to call the police?

1:01:54.370 --> 1:01:58.720
- The irony is you were
supplying practicing Satanists.

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:02.433
Only your men stole from
the real undead this time.

1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:05.740
Couldn't help find that amusing.

1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:07.490
- You stay away from me (gasps).

1:02:08.730 --> 1:02:09.980
- Where is she?

1:02:11.294 --> 1:02:12.637
- I told you I don't know.

1:02:12.637 --> 1:02:14.565
- Where is my daughter?

1:02:14.565 --> 1:02:17.138
Where is Samuel Archer?

1:02:17.138 --> 1:02:19.864
(Margaret gagging)

1:02:19.864 --> 1:02:20.714
Oh that's better.

1:02:21.878 --> 1:02:23.778
Now, that wasn't so difficult, was it?

1:02:27.032 --> 1:02:29.014
(Margaret grunting)
(bone crunching)

1:02:29.014 --> 1:02:33.488
You really should have run
when you had the chance.

1:02:33.488 --> 1:02:38.488
(Kit grunting)
(Kit panting)

1:02:53.145 --> 1:02:55.812
(cash whirring)

1:02:59.658 --> 1:03:00.825
- He's coming?

1:03:26.521 --> 1:03:31.521
- Marshall Mabus, (speaking
in a foreign language),

1:03:32.027 --> 1:03:33.493
you look a bit tired.

1:03:35.450 --> 1:03:37.250
- I've been out in the sun too long.

1:03:40.830 --> 1:03:43.633
- Care for the sun, lapis lazuli.

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:50.673
How is the lovely Michelle?

1:03:52.380 --> 1:03:53.830
- She's having a bite to eat.

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:56.593
- I'll be joining her later.

1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:58.913
- And Anne.

1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:01.123
- Oh, she's with Samuel.

1:04:04.770 --> 1:04:07.163
- I'm so glad you're happy with my work.

1:04:10.100 --> 1:04:11.587
- Where's my adrenochrome.

1:04:12.915 --> 1:04:15.998
(footsteps thudding)

1:04:19.234 --> 1:04:23.317
(speaking in a foreign language)

1:04:29.830 --> 1:04:31.233
- Like nectar to the gods.

1:04:52.535 --> 1:04:54.118
- Where's my money?

1:04:55.830 --> 1:04:57.403
- I need my fix on, baby.

1:04:58.908 --> 1:04:59.991
- Be patient.

1:05:08.070 --> 1:05:12.320
(speaking in a foreign language) .

1:05:18.450 --> 1:05:20.300
- He's not making any sense.

1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:22.300
- Too many murders can do that to a man,

1:05:25.150 --> 1:05:27.017
and he was getting far too expensive.

1:05:28.084 --> 1:05:31.001
(gunshots booming)

1:05:34.232 --> 1:05:36.899
(Mario panting)

1:05:44.793 --> 1:05:47.543
(Mario grunting)

1:06:01.588 --> 1:06:05.671
(speaking in a foreign language)

1:06:26.613 --> 1:06:30.780
(speaking in a foreign language)

1:06:38.630 --> 1:06:40.480
Well, that's perfect, are we, ladies?

1:06:41.410 --> 1:06:42.243
- Quite.

1:06:48.810 --> 1:06:51.810
(cellphone dinging)

1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:01.033
- Yes.

1:07:01.033 --> 1:07:02.420
- [Mike] Where in the hell are you?

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:03.510
- Why are you shouting, Mike?

1:07:03.510 --> 1:07:06.104
I couldn't hear you.
- I was worried about you.

1:07:06.104 --> 1:07:07.620
- There's no need to lose your temper.

1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:10.130
- Are you on your way home.
- Yes, I'm on my way home.

1:07:10.130 --> 1:07:12.760
- It's late.
- I was studying late.

1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:13.963
Why are you behaving like this?

1:07:15.180 --> 1:07:17.450
You need to stop behaving like this.

1:07:17.450 --> 1:07:18.560
I have a test in a few weeks,

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.160
I'm already under a lot of stress.

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:21.630
- [Mike] You'll be home soon?

1:07:21.630 --> 1:07:22.883
- Yes, I'll be home soon.

1:07:24.140 --> 1:07:25.930
- [Mike] You still there?

1:07:25.930 --> 1:07:27.920
Hello?
- (stammers) I need to go now.

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:28.920
- [Mike] Mia, Mia?

1:07:38.771 --> 1:07:41.688
(object squishing)

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:45.300
(Mia panting)

1:07:52.940 --> 1:07:54.010
- Hey,

1:07:54.010 --> 1:07:55.090
slow down.

1:07:55.090 --> 1:07:57.972
- Please, just help me.
- Help you?

1:07:57.972 --> 1:07:59.677
- we have to run.
- Run where (laughs)?

1:07:59.677 --> 1:08:00.640
Run from what?

1:08:02.784 --> 1:08:06.340
(object clanking)

1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:08.090
What's going on?

1:08:08.090 --> 1:08:09.523
Is someone chasing you?

1:08:10.533 --> 1:08:12.253
- (stammers) don't speak.

1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:16.400
- You don't have to be afraid, you know?

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:19.803
I'm ex-military I can
handle a couple of drunks.

1:08:21.690 --> 1:08:22.540
What's your name?

1:08:23.740 --> 1:08:24.690
You're very pretty.

1:08:25.970 --> 1:08:27.980
Get your filthy hands off me.

1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:30.480
- Don't you think I
deserve a little something

1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:31.313
for helping you?

1:08:32.442 --> 1:08:35.525
- Screw you (pants).

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:39.293
- I was only being friendly.

1:08:42.055 --> 1:08:45.676
(car engine growling)

1:08:45.676 --> 1:08:48.593
(object squirming)

1:08:56.706 --> 1:08:58.680
(Kit hissing)

1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:00.780
Don't you come any closer, no, I tell you?

1:09:02.340 --> 1:09:04.930
I'll call the police.
(Kit laughing)

1:09:04.930 --> 1:09:05.763
Stay back.

1:09:07.260 --> 1:09:08.647
I won't tell you again.

1:09:35.857 --> 1:09:38.524
- You can't ignore me all night.

1:09:43.540 --> 1:09:44.373
Come to me.

1:09:52.290 --> 1:09:55.113
Don't make me fetch you.

1:09:58.493 --> 1:09:59.683
Are you hungry.

1:10:02.770 --> 1:10:03.603
- No.

1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:05.993
- Water?

1:10:07.510 --> 1:10:08.693
- [Anna] I'm not thirsty.

1:10:10.630 --> 1:10:11.463
- Very well.

1:10:12.766 --> 1:10:14.649
(object clanking)

1:10:14.649 --> 1:10:15.482
- He's here.

1:10:16.329 --> 1:10:17.829
- Who?
- My father.

1:10:19.410 --> 1:10:21.120
- Nobody knows where
you are except for me.

1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:22.477
- He'll find you.

1:10:24.549 --> 1:10:26.700
That's a lot of noise for
such a small town, isn't it?

1:10:26.700 --> 1:10:29.612
- Be quiet.
- Are you frightened?

1:10:29.612 --> 1:10:31.510
(slap thudding)

1:10:31.510 --> 1:10:34.060
- You're the only one who
needs to understand fear,

1:10:35.350 --> 1:10:37.400
I've waited a long time
for someone like you.

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.370
- She should enjoy every minute,

1:10:39.370 --> 1:10:41.050
you don't have much time left.

1:10:41.050 --> 1:10:44.593
- Oh, I'm gonna enjoy you,
don't you worry about that.

1:10:45.830 --> 1:10:48.260
- Look, you could still let me go.

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:50.293
I'll even put in a good word for you.

1:10:51.808 --> 1:10:53.000
- (laughs)I answer to no man.

1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:56.020
- My father is more than just a man.

1:10:56.020 --> 1:10:58.920
- Do you know how many men
I've killed with my bare hands?

1:10:59.890 --> 1:11:01.400
- That doesn't frighten me.

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:04.393
I could break your neck
right now, do you understand?

1:11:06.430 --> 1:11:10.043
- But you won't, you'd
miss me far too much?

1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:12.300
- What are you?

1:11:12.300 --> 1:11:14.350
- Something you'll never able to control?

1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:16.073
- I want you

1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:18.223
to want me,

1:11:19.060 --> 1:11:19.893
that's all.

1:11:21.580 --> 1:11:24.543
- I will, just not the way you think.

1:11:25.774 --> 1:11:27.320
(person knocking)
- Oh,

1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:29.510
it looks like you could have guests.

1:11:29.510 --> 1:11:32.543
Perhaps my father has
arrived sooner than expected.

1:11:33.610 --> 1:11:35.620
- Be quiet.
- He'll be very pleased

1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:38.139
to meet you, I can tell you that much.

1:11:38.139 --> 1:11:38.972
(person knocking)

1:11:38.972 --> 1:11:40.910
- I'm gonna go check outside.

1:11:40.910 --> 1:11:42.670
- I'd stay here if I were you,

1:11:42.670 --> 1:11:44.700
it's better to die in
your bed than out there

1:11:44.700 --> 1:11:45.983
in the dark and cold.

1:11:45.983 --> 1:11:47.485
(slap thudding)

1:11:47.485 --> 1:11:49.337
- One more word out of you,

1:11:49.337 --> 1:11:51.210
I'm gonna put a bullet between
those pretty eyes of yours,

1:11:51.210 --> 1:11:52.842
do you understand?

1:11:52.842 --> 1:11:54.630
- It wouldn't have the
effect you were looking for.

1:11:54.630 --> 1:11:55.580
- What do you mean?

1:11:58.650 --> 1:12:00.050
- Just been toying with you.

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:03.480
- Toy?
(person knocking)

1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:06.800
- Go, go and see what's outside.

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:08.650
I'll still be here when you get back.

1:12:10.130 --> 1:12:12.430
- I wish you'd stop
speaking in those riddles..

1:12:12.430 --> 1:12:14.580
- I have to keep you
on your toes, don't I?

1:12:16.470 --> 1:12:19.060
- You just wait here until I get back.

1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:20.830
- Of course, anything you say

1:12:26.599 --> 1:12:28.180
(Anna sighing)

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:29.380
I know you're out there.

1:12:30.530 --> 1:12:31.980
We'll be together again soon.

1:12:35.283 --> 1:12:38.033
(body squishing)

1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:47.920
- Hands-off, bitch, that piece is mine.

1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:50.877
- Yours, I did all the dirty work.

1:12:50.877 --> 1:12:52.570
- Dirty, you can say that again.

1:12:52.570 --> 1:12:54.991
- What's your mouth.
- Watch yours.

1:12:54.991 --> 1:12:57.991
(Marshall grunting)

1:13:00.275 --> 1:13:05.275
(body squishing)
(cellphone dinging)

1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:09.774
- Samuel?

1:13:09.774 --> 1:13:10.607
- [Samuel] Kid escaped.

1:13:10.607 --> 1:13:13.126
I hear all kind of crazy tales.

1:13:13.126 --> 1:13:15.570
This is your fault, boss, you sent Mario,

1:13:15.570 --> 1:13:17.330
and it was your pick.

1:13:17.330 --> 1:13:18.930
Who the hell is this kid anyway?

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.413
- Stop worrying, it'll be sorted.

1:13:48.927 --> 1:13:50.060
- Brought you all here,
'cause I want to start hearing

1:13:50.060 --> 1:13:50.933
some answers.

1:13:52.410 --> 1:13:54.323
All this talk of monsters and shit.

1:13:56.720 --> 1:13:59.253
I found Margaret laying down on the floor!

1:14:00.260 --> 1:14:02.260
It took me an hour to clean up her body.

1:14:03.900 --> 1:14:05.500
I wanna start hearing the truth.

1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:08.033
You start.

1:14:10.530 --> 1:14:12.000
- He was huge.

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.163
- Don't exaggerate.

1:14:14.780 --> 1:14:17.970
- He was like, I don't
know, over eight feet tall.

1:14:17.970 --> 1:14:19.430
- I saw everything.

1:14:19.430 --> 1:14:20.343
Stop lying.

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:22.570
- I'm not, look (grunts).

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:28.980
- Imbecile, you know I made a
big mistake hiring this idiot.

1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:31.103
- I couldn't have put it better myself.

1:14:33.050 --> 1:14:34.100
- Did you follow 'em?

1:14:35.850 --> 1:14:38.397
- No, we were too scared (whimpers).

1:14:39.300 --> 1:14:40.133
- Scared?

1:14:41.750 --> 1:14:43.883
I pay you both not to be afraid.

1:14:45.260 --> 1:14:46.483
- You didn't see him.

1:14:47.762 --> 1:14:50.337
You wouldn't understand.

1:14:50.337 --> 1:14:51.893
- Are you saying Bobby's
telling the truth?

1:14:53.490 --> 1:14:54.323
- Partly.

1:14:56.640 --> 1:14:58.153
- I didn't deserve that boss.

1:15:00.340 --> 1:15:01.790
- Would you like another one?

1:15:07.590 --> 1:15:11.550
- He wasn't human.
(Samuel laughing)

1:15:11.550 --> 1:15:12.903
- I'm telling the truth.

1:15:13.990 --> 1:15:15.203
- She is.

1:15:16.530 --> 1:15:18.410
- You're trying to cover for his tracks.

1:15:18.410 --> 1:15:19.417
- You let him escape.
- No.

1:15:19.417 --> 1:15:21.660
- Do you think I'm stupid.

1:15:21.660 --> 1:15:22.710
- You didn't see him.

1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:25.603
If you saw him, you'd believe.

1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:29.453
He changed right before eyes.

1:15:32.580 --> 1:15:33.780
- Do you believe me now?

1:15:39.170 --> 1:15:41.210
- Be quiet.
- You can still get away

1:15:41.210 --> 1:15:42.103
if you leave now.

1:15:45.110 --> 1:15:45.943
- sit down.

1:15:47.590 --> 1:15:49.360
No one's leaving.

1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:51.930
We stay here 'til first light.
(Anna laughing)

1:15:51.930 --> 1:15:53.930
- You won't be alive by tomorrow morning

1:15:55.017 --> 1:15:57.196
(objects clanking)
- What was that?

1:15:57.196 --> 1:15:58.660
- You had your chance.

1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:01.463
- We need to Leave.
- Stay where you are.

1:16:02.430 --> 1:16:04.217
One more footstep, and
I'll kill you both myself.

1:16:04.217 --> 1:16:06.783
- Bullets will have no
effect on my father.

1:16:10.005 --> 1:16:13.200
- You don't understand,
we need to leave now.

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:14.823
- The idiot's right for once.

1:16:18.374 --> 1:16:19.663
- [Bobby] Can you see anything?

1:16:23.030 --> 1:16:25.120
- He won't reveal himself to you,

1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:27.050
you'll only see him when it's too late.

1:16:27.050 --> 1:16:28.320
- Shut up.

1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:29.820
- [Sasha] Kill the bitch

1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:32.083
- [Bobby] If you don't kill her, I will.

1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:35.310
- Get the car keys from my desk, Bobby.

1:16:35.310 --> 1:16:36.143
- Yes, boss.

1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:39.460
- Where shall we go?

1:16:39.460 --> 1:16:42.202
- I have safe houses scattered
around, we'll be safe there.

1:16:42.202 --> 1:16:43.560
- (laughs) That's what you think.

1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:44.453
- What about her?

1:16:46.399 --> 1:16:48.450
There is plenty like this one.

1:16:48.450 --> 1:16:51.153
We'll get you a new toy, give me the gun.

1:16:53.110 --> 1:16:55.170
Ready when you are, boss.
- Can I please just come,

1:16:55.170 --> 1:16:56.810
and watch you all die?

1:16:56.810 --> 1:17:00.163
- Kill her!
(electricity whooshing)

1:17:01.038 --> 1:17:03.020
Are you kidding me, right?

1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:05.537
- Stand close.
- Get off me.

1:17:05.537 --> 1:17:07.420
(Samuel whimpering)

1:17:07.420 --> 1:17:08.253
- Sasha?

1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:10.570
Bobby (whimpers)?

1:17:12.830 --> 1:17:13.723
Where's everyone.

1:17:16.230 --> 1:17:17.063
- He's here.

1:17:19.023 --> 1:17:21.690
(body thudding)

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.113
- Anna?
- Father.

1:17:28.870 --> 1:17:29.703
- What are you?

1:17:30.810 --> 1:17:33.507
- I am a friend of the night.

1:17:34.894 --> 1:17:39.894
(Samuel grunting)
(Samuel gagging)

1:17:41.043 --> 1:17:42.300
(gunshot booming)

1:17:42.300 --> 1:17:43.633
- Father?
- Anna!

1:17:45.334 --> 1:17:47.826
- Father (pants)?

1:17:47.826 --> 1:17:48.659
Father?

1:17:52.653 --> 1:17:55.290
- Anna please.
- I'm going to die.

1:17:55.290 --> 1:17:57.490
- It's not your time
yet, it's the only way.

1:17:59.431 --> 1:18:00.848
- Just let me go.

1:18:09.984 --> 1:18:12.817
(teeth crunching)

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:22.111
(gun clanking)

1:18:27.116 --> 1:18:30.391
- I'm gonna find you, Kit.

1:18:30.391 --> 1:18:31.591
I'm gonna find you both.

1:18:37.906 --> 1:18:40.720
(gun cocking)

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:42.860
- You know, it was the only way.

1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:43.693
- I know.

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:47.760
- Well, now you're stuck
with me for eternity.

1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:49.343
- Sounds quite good to me, Dad.

1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:51.913
- Are you hungry?

1:18:52.900 --> 1:18:55.340
- I'm gonna be the one
who treats you this time.

1:18:55.340 --> 1:18:57.620
- Very well.
- We must be quick though,

1:18:57.620 --> 1:18:59.570
we can't miss our train back to London.

1:18:59.570 --> 1:19:00.403
- After you.

1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:03.980
- We have rich pickings
to choose from here.

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:06.640
- Well, just make sure it's
a good vintage this time.

1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:08.286
- I shall, and then?

1:19:08.286 --> 1:19:11.378
- And then, we go back to our nest.

1:19:11.378 --> 1:19:14.211
(birds chirping)
