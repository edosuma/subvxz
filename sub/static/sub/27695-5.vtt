WEBVTT

00:43.001 --> 00:45.254
II'

00:50.300 --> 00:54.054
Troop, present arms!

00:56.848 --> 01:00.811
II'

01:04.231 --> 01:06.858
Freedom for Ireland!

01:10.195 --> 01:11.905
Mama!

01:12.990 --> 01:14.658
It's a man!

01:14.825 --> 01:16.285
Vicky!

01:23.333 --> 01:25.127
Your Majesty?

01:27.963 --> 01:30.424
Skerrett, yes, I sent for you.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.969
Skerrett.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.974
No, not Skerrett.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.560
Oh, forgive me,
Turner, I've, um...

01:44.271 --> 01:47.316
had a bit of a shock.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.860
Yes, ma'am.

01:50.027 --> 01:53.780
How can I be of service?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.325
See if you can salvage my hair.

02:01.455 --> 02:07.419
The children witnessed
nothing of the attack, thank God,

02:07.586 --> 02:09.546
but they did see the man
on the ground.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.258
The police say he was Irish.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.551
Big surprise.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.431
What do you mean?

02:19.598 --> 02:23.185
What's the significance
of his being Irish?

02:23.352 --> 02:24.645
We have striven very hard

02:24.811 --> 02:27.230
to resolve the terrible
situation in Ireland.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.750
The undersecretary told me
himself,

02:28.774 --> 02:30.134
"The Irish incident is now
closed."

02:30.275 --> 02:31.568
Huh, he would.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.279
Turner, are you saying
my undersecretary was lying?

02:34.446 --> 02:36.073
No, truly, ma'am,
I have no opinion...

02:36.239 --> 02:37.508
Really? Because you seem
to have an opinion

02:37.532 --> 02:38.617
on everything else.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.056
The hunger for food
may have gone away, ma'am,

02:43.080 --> 02:45.582
but the hunger for independence
has only increased.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.030
That...
that is what the Irish say

02:50.170 --> 02:51.672
when you talk to 'em.

02:51.838 --> 02:58.970
II'

02:59.137 --> 03:01.348
should have been with you.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.974
Papa.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.915
Today we had
a man try to kill us.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.649
I keep telling you,

03:10.816 --> 03:12.067
he couldn't of,

03:12.234 --> 03:13.402
he had no bullets in his gun.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.112
Couldn't have, Bertie.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.947
Couldn't have.

03:19.658 --> 03:20.492
Papa is here.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.661
All shall be Well.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.055
I, uh, hope
it's not inconvenient,

03:24.079 --> 03:25.163
but Mr. Caine is here.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.582
Came? Yes, yes, yes.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.710
Bertie, you are to have
your own tutor.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.003
You did agree.
I agreed in principle.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.482
I didn't agree to you appointing
someone without consulting me.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.007
Well, I met the man
in Cambridge.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.360
I think you should warm to him.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.384
Ah,

03:38.427 --> 03:40.554
<i>Mr. Came.</i>

03:42.556 --> 03:43.932
<i>Mr. Came.</i>

03:44.099 --> 03:45.183
Your Majesty.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.477
I trust your

03:47.644 --> 03:49.521
does not presage
your preferred method.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.998
I had enough
flogging at Eton, ma'am,

03:51.022 --> 03:52.774
to last several lifetimes.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.317
It is not my teaching style.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.574
Why don't I get a tutor?

04:00.741 --> 04:03.160
<i>You have your Aunt Feodora.</i>

04:05.996 --> 04:08.290
Mr. Caine, welcome.

04:09.833 --> 04:13.211
Delighted to meet you,
Your Royal Highness.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.630
II'

04:19.301 --> 04:23.054
I think we should go to Ireland.

04:23.221 --> 04:27.142
For what possible reason?

04:27.309 --> 04:32.564
Because I have a feeling
that the Irish might be right.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.526
Right that it is correct

04:36.693 --> 04:40.739
to threaten our children
with guns?

04:40.906 --> 04:44.618
Right that it is difficult
to respect the authority

04:44.785 --> 04:46.077
of a queen one has never seen.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.040
Heaven knows if I were Irish,

04:50.207 --> 04:54.461
it might dispose me
to independence.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.089
Monarchy does not, um...

04:58.256 --> 05:00.008
cannot depend on an obligation

05:00.175 --> 05:03.261
for you to show your face
to every single person.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.432
No British monarch
has set foot in Ireland

05:07.599 --> 05:09.184
since the Middle Ages.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.774
That speaks of lack of interest.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.692
Or fear, perhaps.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.656
I shan't be accused of either.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.324
You think I've lost my mind.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.785
No, ma'am, you are intrepid.

05:26.952 --> 05:30.080
But it would be negligent
not to remark

05:30.247 --> 05:32.916
that Ireland is
a Catholic country.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.710
The famine is enshrined
in the culture

05:35.877 --> 05:37.879
as a crime perpetrated
by British Protestants,

05:38.046 --> 05:39.548
the church of which

05:39.714 --> 05:41.424
you're the head, ma'am.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.510
The excursion could involve
some danger.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.957
The foreign secretary
will ensure

05:45.053 --> 05:46.638
we don't come to any harm.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.265
He has a house there in Sligo.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.516
Is that not so, my lord?

05:49.683 --> 05:50.767
Where he keeps his wife.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.686
So he knows the territory,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.372
and he can finesse
our progress accordingly.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.856
It will be an honor

05:56.022 --> 05:57.315
and a, and a privilege.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.900
Ma'am, Ireland is lovely,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.861
and we shall of course
accommodate you

06:01.027 --> 06:02.279
at Classiebawn Castle.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.323
May I suggest a modest party
for travel?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.951
Is your castle small?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.452
Oh, um...

06:09.619 --> 06:12.163
Ireland is glariaus, butpoon.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.690
The people will,
of course, delight

06:13.790 --> 06:16.084
in seeing their queen
and her immediate family

06:16.251 --> 06:19.588
but may be nonplussed

06:19.754 --> 06:21.131
at the full panoply
of the court.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.591
Yes, I agree.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.135
But, um...

06:25.302 --> 06:28.638
surely it is not necessary

06:28.805 --> 06:30.283
for you to extend to us
your hospitality.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.808
Oh, my wife will be cranky
if I don't.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.870
She'll be cranky because
you keep her squirrelled away

06:33.894 --> 06:35.103
in the country.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.980
There is no squirrelling
of Emily, ma'am.

06:40.275 --> 06:45.113
II'

06:45.280 --> 06:48.241
So.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.660
Ireland it is.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.163
L'm sure the moment
she steps on Irish soil,

06:53.330 --> 06:56.166
she will conquer Irish hearts.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.584
Hmm.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.170
Doubtless Palmerston
encouraged her in this.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.049
Since the birth of Louise,

07:04.215 --> 07:06.593
her ability to distinguish
good advice

07:06.760 --> 07:08.845
from bad...

07:09.012 --> 07:11.681
That was impertinent of me.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.934
Forgive me.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.980
Perhaps childbirth
can cloud herjudgment.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.274
But...

07:21.441 --> 07:24.069
but is not something
I wish to say to her,

07:24.235 --> 07:26.571
nor think about.

07:26.738 --> 07:30.450
That is because you love her,
Albert.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.954
That's so commendable.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.938
What can be my treat for this?

08:00.105 --> 08:04.234
We don't always proceed
by treats, Bertie.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.819
There are other incentives.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.084
II'

08:21.251 --> 08:22.502
Look and learn.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.256
II'

08:28.299 --> 08:30.427
And the hatboxes, Your Grace.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.513
The Duchess looks wretched.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.350
What is wrong, do you know?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.228
Think there is presently
some... antipathy

08:40.395 --> 08:42.355
between Sophie and her husband.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.024
I knew it.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.860
It's because I dragged her off
to Osborne without him.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.087
Well, he must come to Ireland.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.821
I shall insist on it.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.173
Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness.

08:51.197 --> 08:51.948
Papa. Hmm?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.115
Pick a card.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.452
Pick a card?

08:56.745 --> 09:00.373
Very well.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.834
Nine. Pick another.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.630
The queen.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.467
The queen counts as 12.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.598
Nine multiplied by 12...

09:16.765 --> 09:18.683
equals...

09:18.850 --> 09:20.143
108.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.104
Mr. Caine, that is remarkable.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.356
I take no credit, sir;
Bertie told me

09:25.523 --> 09:27.108
how you taught him the alphabet.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.027
Merely improvised
upon your theme-.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.988
The true achievement is his.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.740
Well, even so.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.241
It is remarkable.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.577
Bertie, you must remain here
with Mr. Caine

09:37.744 --> 09:39.704
to continue your studies

09:39.871 --> 09:41.956
whilst Mamma and I are
in Ireland.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.710
Your brother and sisters
will remain here also.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.962
Aunt Feodora will be here
to care for you all.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.551
Duchess,

09:53.718 --> 09:55.970
I have good news.

09:56.137 --> 10:02.519
II'

10:02.685 --> 10:04.771
Allow me, my dear.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.693
Good bye Mama, Good bye, Papa.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.490
Come back soon.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.033
II'

10:23.164 --> 10:26.835
II'

10:33.508 --> 10:37.720
II'

10:50.233 --> 10:53.444
II'

11:08.960 --> 11:10.253
Present arms!

11:21.347 --> 11:22.932
Your Majesty, rna'am.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.499
You are most welcome
to County Cork.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.189
It is splendid to be here.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.555
Go back to where you came from!

11:44.579 --> 11:46.998
- That's enough, now!
- This is our land!

11:47.165 --> 11:48.249
This is Ireland!

12:08.353 --> 12:10.230
Thank you again.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.612
Ma'am, mayl presume
to ride with you?

12:17.779 --> 12:21.532
It would enable me to point out
sundry items of interest.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.785
Mmm.

12:28.790 --> 12:33.586
II'

13:03.241 --> 13:05.660
Have you been in
the public houses, Palmerston,

13:05.827 --> 13:07.328
securing local enthusiasm?

13:07.495 --> 13:09.330
Sir, that's
an extraordinary suggestion.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.208
Do you seriously envisage me
in a public house?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.963
This land is our land!
Not yours!

13:17.130 --> 13:17.964
Not yours!

13:18.131 --> 13:19.340
This is our land!

13:26.723 --> 13:29.017
Clearly one I missed.

13:29.183 --> 13:32.687
II'

13:43.197 --> 13:45.342
The queen took it into her head
to insist on him coming.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.243
I know, she told me.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.578
I mean, what could I do?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.747
Tell her she was wrong?

13:50.913 --> 13:55.335
My position at the court
is all I have, Emma.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.463
I cannot forfeit it
by disagreeing with her.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.552
Excuse me, ladies,

14:04.719 --> 14:06.179
what have I missed?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.389
We were talking
about Emily Palmerston.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.225
Does she resemble her brother?

14:11.392 --> 14:14.896
She is a little like
Lord Melbourne, yes.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.523
It's been a while
since I saw her.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.930
She was a great force in London

14:18.983 --> 14:20.860
when she was married
to Lord Cowper.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.071
He died.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.864
Now she prefers Ireland.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.657
Much to the chagrin
of Lord Palmerston.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.411
He pines for her.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.038
Apparently.

14:39.962 --> 14:44.217
II'

14:46.719 --> 14:48.763
This is your park,
Lord Palmerston?

14:48.930 --> 14:50.014
Unkempt, ma'am,

14:50.181 --> 14:52.350
but much loved.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.358
II'

15:02.443 --> 15:03.528
Come.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.624
Is her ladyship at home?

15:16.791 --> 15:19.544
Who wants to know?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.087
Her husband.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.091
Your husband, madam.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.597
Your Majesty,

15:31.764 --> 15:33.324
please, may I introduce
Lady Palmerston?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.564
II'

15:43.651 --> 15:45.778
Reverend Hannam, ma'am.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.283
II'

15:50.450 --> 15:52.952
Whatever can I do for you, sir?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.704
Lam a humble parson, ma'am,

15:54.871 --> 15:57.915
who seeks a preferment
in the church.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.751
Specifically the deanship
of Ely.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.213
I'll repeat the question.

16:04.380 --> 16:09.927
You are by repute a lady

16:10.094 --> 16:12.221
of the greatest influence,
ma'am.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.601
I entreat you
to endorse my cause.

16:16.767 --> 16:20.938
You are asking me to help secure

16:21.105 --> 16:23.191
<i>the whatever-Kt-Ks of aw?</i>

16:23.357 --> 16:25.359
Lam indeed, ma'am.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.196
For any assistance
you can give me,

16:28.362 --> 16:32.617
I should be...
excessively grateful.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.745
II'

16:38.206 --> 16:39.790
So you agree with Schopenhauer.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.501
Do I?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.627
That's very clever of me,
I've never heard of him.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.464
He says women lack intelligence

16:46.631 --> 16:48.007
by design.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.258
God, yes.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.762
Consider the Duchess.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.764
Only got to look at her to see

16:54.931 --> 16:56.933
that she's ill-adapted
to cogent thought.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.313
Duke, you are ungallant.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.732
That don't make me wrong.

17:04.899 --> 17:06.609
No, it makes you a boor.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.905
O-R-E or O-O-R? Both.

17:11.072 --> 17:12.156
Either.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.866
O-A-R, perhaps.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.258
Excuse me for saying it, ma'am,

17:30.424 --> 17:31.634
but I think it brave of you

17:31.801 --> 17:34.095
to come to this country.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.806
The Irish are not entirely
predictable in their emotions.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.766
<i>Bu“ hear they were out</i>

17:38.933 --> 17:41.310
for you today en masse.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.562
Oh, well,

17:42.728 --> 17:44.855
not really large gatherings,

17:45.022 --> 17:47.233
but, yes, very enthusiastic.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.653
My husband was not wholly
convinced by what we saw.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.947
Though we saw the same thing.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.783
Well, I saw what we were shown.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.369
Which is,

17:58.536 --> 18:01.038
the people who have
recently ravaged by famine,

18:01.205 --> 18:02.957
who have every reason
to hate us,

18:03.124 --> 18:06.210
Cheering as our carriage
went past.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.588
You reproach
the Irish for being friendly?

18:08.754 --> 18:11.465
Will their smiles extend
to Dublin?

18:11.632 --> 18:14.176
We shall see.

18:14.343 --> 18:18.097
II'

18:28.899 --> 18:32.820
Is the Duke of Monmouth prone
to perform like a wild pig?

18:32.987 --> 18:35.156
To be frank, ma'am, yes, he is.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.951
And how am I to perform
in Dublin?

18:39.118 --> 18:43.873
Your task is ta make
the Catholic many

18:44.040 --> 18:45.958
know that they belong
to the same United Kingdom

18:46.125 --> 18:47.209
as the Protestant few,

18:47.376 --> 18:49.378
Regardless of allegiance
to church.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.340
A performance Your Majesty is
eminently capable of.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.508
Will they bray in my face?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.177
Tell me
this country is not mine?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.762
I should doubt that, ma'am.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.389
How very subjunctive of you.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.267
The daughter from Lady
Palmerston's first marriage.

19:03.434 --> 19:07.396
It's curious,
but she looks exactly

19:07.563 --> 19:09.148
like Lord Palmerston.

19:13.444 --> 19:17.907
II'

19:18.074 --> 19:19.760
Do you endeavor to inform me
with your silence

19:19.784 --> 19:22.995
that she is in fact his child?

19:23.162 --> 19:27.166
That is the general view, sir.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.961
Conceived whilst the mother was
still married to Lord Cowper?

19:31.128 --> 19:33.214
Dear God,
we are among barbarians.

19:38.344 --> 19:43.015
II'

19:44.308 --> 19:47.269
Listen close, Your Grace.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.146
You can hear those waves.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.657
Strange woman in my bed.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.659
Lucky you.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.247
Are you hating this?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.374
Not at all.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.835
I can see it is a strain
for you, and I don't like that.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.921
<i>Bu“ am happy to do my part.
Monmouth.</i>

20:14.088 --> 20:16.424
Monmouth is vile.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.717
But he always was.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.636
That poor girl.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.852
One does feel sorry for her.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.145
Is that all one feels?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.855
On, Emily.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.148
That's beneath you.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.151
Just as long
as she isn't beneath you.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.322
You have my word.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.494
<i>Good.</i>

20:45.661 --> 20:46.746
Thank you.

20:46.912 --> 20:47.997
Although, I think it shows

20:48.164 --> 20:50.082
an uncharacteristic lapse
of taste.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.418
She is very decorative.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.104
It's as though
she doesn't own any skin,

20:54.128 --> 20:56.255
she has been flayed.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.592
The only thing
that will repair her is love.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.179
Then you are not the man
for the job.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.515
My own darling, 1 am not.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.691
I confess I am at a loss.

21:15.858 --> 21:21.781
We went to Scotland for
the adventure of being away.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.915
Are we the same people
as we were then?

21:34.335 --> 21:37.880
Why do we see thing
so differently now?

21:40.591 --> 21:44.470
We are not the same.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.972
I feel no different.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.017
II'

21:50.184 --> 21:52.686
We have six children.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.525
It is a strain.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.195
How is it a strain?

22:01.362 --> 22:05.449
Are we not overflowing
with servants?

22:07.034 --> 22:08.327
Not for me.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.874
But for you.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.756
Since the birth of Louise,

22:20.923 --> 22:22.967
you have been making decisions
that are...

22:28.931 --> 22:30.057
Questionable.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.273
Feodora thinks the same.

22:41.944 --> 22:45.489
You've been
dis-cussing; My judgment with her?

22:45.656 --> 22:46.936
And what has the birth of Louise

22:46.991 --> 22:49.535
possibly got to do with it?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.495
Albert, I don't shed
part of my brain

22:51.662 --> 22:52.872
every time I have a baby.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.043
Dear God, Albert,
what has she been saying to you?

23:03.966 --> 23:07.595
I was speaking tonight,
and you rolled your eyes.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.306
You were not meant to see that.

23:17.771 --> 23:18.971
When did we start doing things

23:19.106 --> 23:21.650
that the other wasn't meant
to see?

23:21.817 --> 23:25.738
II'

23:35.539 --> 23:36.916
What is this?

23:37.082 --> 23:39.960
It's a light wine suitable
for breakfast.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.007
You don't care for it?

23:46.550 --> 23:47.760
Ah.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.764
I'm sure
Mr. Caine will drink it.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.098
Your Serene Highness.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.600
Come, Bertie, back to work.

23:56.852 --> 24:02.524
II'

24:05.527 --> 24:07.404
On to mathematics now, Bertie.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.533
Do you like Mr. Caine,
Aunt Feodora?

24:11.700 --> 24:13.577
He is a domestic servant,

24:13.744 --> 24:15.037
it is not a meaningful question.

24:16.664 --> 24:17.748
Brodie,

24:17.915 --> 24:21.752
do you like Mr. Caine?

24:21.919 --> 24:23.337
Not a great deal, n0.

24:29.343 --> 24:33.097
II'

24:50.280 --> 24:51.280
Hello?

24:51.407 --> 24:52.574
Is anybody there?

24:55.452 --> 25:00.332
II'

25:04.086 --> 25:06.714
Avillage without people.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.593
Where are all of the tenants,
Alfred?

25:14.888 --> 25:16.557
What has Palmerston done
with them?

25:26.442 --> 25:28.944
This is a delightful house.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.487
Thank you, ma'am.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.197
I agree.

25:32.364 --> 25:36.535
It's why I choose to spend
most of my time here.

25:36.702 --> 25:40.622
And yet Lord Palmerston is
always to be found in London.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.183
He is a minister
of government, ma'am.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.334
It could not be otherwise.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.506
Is it not painful to be
separated

25:49.673 --> 25:51.133
for such long intervals?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.718
Immensely, ma'am.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.679
But it is the rhythm
of our marriage.

25:55.846 --> 26:00.684
A cycle of sad partings
and joyous reunitings.

26:00.851 --> 26:03.187
Besides, I have my bees.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.940
Lord Palmerston has no bees.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.234
No, ma'am,
he has his collection.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.611
Ah.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.738
I see.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.323
What does he collect?

26:14.490 --> 26:15.616
Other women.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.913
When Henry is away from me,
and he is desirous

26:21.080 --> 26:24.124
of that which men most desire,

26:24.291 --> 26:27.753
he places his boots
outside his bedroom door.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.880
It signifies his availability.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.966
Then, when he comes home,
he tells me...

26:33.133 --> 26:35.844
whether or not
his invitation was taken up

26:36.011 --> 26:37.846
and by whom.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.098
He tells you?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.390
He tells me everything.

26:44.686 --> 26:49.858
And... do you...

26:50.025 --> 26:52.528
as it were, when he is away?

26:52.694 --> 26:54.655
Place my boots outside my door?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.365
On Qccajsien, ma'am, have.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.408
As I observe to Henry,

26:58.575 --> 27:00.327
there is only so much
satisfaction to be got

27:00.494 --> 27:01.870
from the keeping of bees.

27:02.037 --> 27:06.250
There is honey, ma'am,
and there is honey.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.960
<i>I do find the
Palmerstons' marriage</i>

27:08.127 --> 27:10.504
extraordinary.

27:10.671 --> 27:15.008
In certain ways
it's, it's quite like ours.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.764
Not in others.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.061
And what is the matter with you?

27:26.228 --> 27:27.813
The matter's not with me,
Victoria.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.460
The matter is
with Palmerston himself.

27:31.108 --> 27:34.862
The man is mendacious,
and I despise him for it.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.321
Lunch.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.324
Correct. Enjoy it.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.871
I'm not hungry.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.961
Victoria, he has been having
liaisons.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.130
He has.

27:56.383 --> 27:57.509
So has she.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.470
She told me.

28:00.637 --> 28:01.917
It is a marriage
without secrets.

28:02.014 --> 28:05.350
Everything here is a lie

28:05.517 --> 28:08.228
concocted by Palmerston.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.813
He also, I believe...

28:09.980 --> 28:11.732
Based on evidence
I uncovered today...

28:11.899 --> 28:13.376
Has been treating his tenants
deplorably.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.236
I know nothing about that.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.197
Liebes, please.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.242
Come down with me.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.494
II'

28:24.661 --> 28:26.371
A show of unity?

28:28.957 --> 28:30.292
How, in your eyes,

28:30.459 --> 28:32.836
does that make us any less false
than our hosts'?

28:34.671 --> 28:38.759
II'

29:33.647 --> 29:34.731
Will you walk with me,

29:34.898 --> 29:36.024
Your Grace?

29:41.655 --> 29:43.699
Where are we going, Albert?

29:43.865 --> 29:45.784
There is something
you need to see.

29:49.913 --> 29:54.793
II'

30:11.476 --> 30:14.062
My Tess, see,
she'd have covered that

30:14.229 --> 30:16.106
in about five seconds.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.653
My mare.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.405
I used to ride her on the sands

30:23.572 --> 30:24.865
at Bamburgh.

30:34.207 --> 30:37.294
What?

30:37.461 --> 30:39.087
I'm imagining you on a horse.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.256
You can be poor
and have a horse.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.300
That's not what I meant.

30:47.554 --> 30:51.308
I could do it on foot in... ten?

30:51.475 --> 30:52.475
From where to where?

30:52.559 --> 30:54.686
From there to there, the boat.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.937
So could I.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.361
II'

31:09.910 --> 31:12.329
Ah.

31:24.424 --> 31:28.887
You and me, you know...

31:29.054 --> 31:32.432
we're the same.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.685
We both have no power.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.646
Footman,

31:37.813 --> 31:39.564
duchess,

31:39.731 --> 31:41.983
no power.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.361
I get pushed around
by the steward,

31:44.528 --> 31:47.280
you get pushed around
by your husband.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.907
What's the odds?

31:53.078 --> 31:56.206
But I tell you this for free,
Sophie.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.874
It won't always be that way.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.145
Where's he been sent to school,

32:01.169 --> 32:03.422
<i>'JQur son'?</i>

32:03.588 --> 32:08.009
"All Mon go to Harrow."

32:09.594 --> 32:11.638
My son's going to Eton.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.434
You have a son?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.227
No.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.482
Well, that's where he's going.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.700
I should like you to kiss me.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.875
I offer you love, Sophie.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.168
Nothing less.

32:43.253 --> 32:47.757
II'

32:47.924 --> 32:49.050
Kiss me.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.846
II'

33:06.026 --> 33:09.654
II'

33:28.590 --> 33:30.800
If one didn't know better,

33:30.967 --> 33:33.178
one might suppose
that was the pouting footman

33:33.345 --> 33:36.139
with the shoulders.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.434
Or do I mistake him?

33:45.315 --> 33:46.900
You do not.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.198
Whoa!

33:56.785 --> 33:58.495
Victoria!

33:59.829 --> 34:00.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.083
Good man. Easy, easy.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.459
Easy.

34:04.626 --> 34:05.919
So sorry to have frightened you!

34:06.086 --> 34:07.566
What in God's name are
you doing, man?

34:07.629 --> 34:10.090
Firing guns? 'Tis my job, sir.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.716
I'm Lord Palmerston's
gamekeeper.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.010
The name's Magee.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.571
There's never anybody here
but rabbits, me, and the ghosts.

34:15.595 --> 34:16.680
What ghosts?

34:16.846 --> 34:18.515
The villagers were cleared out,
so...

34:18.682 --> 34:21.226
His Lordship's a fair man,

34:21.393 --> 34:22.578
but he's no different
to the rest of the gentry

34:22.602 --> 34:24.396
when it comes to the folks.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.690
In comes the famine,
out go the peasants.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.234
The gentry's all English,

34:29.401 --> 34:31.319
they don't want to talk
to the starving tenants.

34:31.486 --> 34:34.781
They call 'em dirty Papists.

34:34.948 --> 34:36.783
I travel to Dublin, Mr. Magee,

34:36.950 --> 34:38.451
expressly to address
that disharmony.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.205
Huh.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.541
Do you so?

34:44.708 --> 34:45.875
Sure you'll love Dublin.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.544
It's a great city.

34:51.631 --> 34:56.678
II'

35:04.728 --> 35:07.230
Late breakfast, Duchess?

35:07.397 --> 35:08.523
I went for a walk.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.609
Yes, I know.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.407
Forgive me if I speak bluntly.

35:17.574 --> 35:22.329
But you have an itch...

35:22.495 --> 35:24.164
that you can't quite reach.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.915
And I am anxious

35:26.082 --> 35:28.710
that the person you've chosen
to scratch it for you

35:28.877 --> 35:31.838
is... not appropriate.

35:32.005 --> 35:35.800
So please...

35:35.967 --> 35:37.177
Please, Sophie,

35:37.344 --> 35:39.596
<i>meg of you, be very careful.</i>

35:45.935 --> 35:47.020
Morning, both.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.064
Henry,

35:49.230 --> 35:52.651
the prince is looking for you.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.943
He's pretty bated.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.039
And you have been where?

36:06.206 --> 36:07.999
Went for a walk on the sands.

36:09.668 --> 36:13.213
Did you?

36:13.380 --> 36:15.006
Did you.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.009
(How 1°")!-

36:18.176 --> 36:21.721
Mind how you go, my dear.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.479
Sir, you wished to see me?

36:41.282 --> 36:43.868
I have been to the village.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.120
Your village.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.289
You do not deny
that you have a village?

36:48.456 --> 36:49.816
Well, the physical place,
sir, yes,

36:49.874 --> 36:51.459
it's, uh, entailed
to the estate.

36:51.626 --> 36:52.937
But there's
no one living there now.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.045
That is clear.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.089
Where are they?
New York, mostly.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.301
Explain. Of course.

37:00.468 --> 37:03.763
When the famine was
at its height,

37:03.930 --> 37:05.170
I conferred with the villagers,

37:05.223 --> 37:07.142
and we decided that

37:07.308 --> 37:10.812
it was best that they left
and begun afresh in America.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.897
And I, I enabled them to do so.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.149
That is what you do

37:14.315 --> 37:15.710
with people who you find
inconvenient?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.068
You pay them to go away?

37:17.235 --> 37:19.028
They were glad to leave.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.235
They write to me from New York,
often telling me so.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.324
No one paid them to do that.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.744
Nevertheless,

37:25.910 --> 37:28.455
you considered them to be
"dirty Papists."

37:28.621 --> 37:30.623
I did not, sir.
Who said that I did?

37:30.790 --> 37:33.418
I was told
by your own gamekeeper,

37:33.585 --> 37:35.420
Magee.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.380
Magee is no one's gamekeeper,
sir.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.048
He's a poacher.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.383
And as a magistrate,

37:40.550 --> 37:41.986
I send him to prison
on a regular basis.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.094
I rather like the fellow,

37:43.261 --> 37:46.306
but, um, he does like mischief.

37:46.473 --> 37:51.686
The would-be assassins
that were arrested in Cork,

37:51.853 --> 37:54.397
the men who you chose
not to tell us about,

37:54.564 --> 37:55.815
what of them?

37:55.982 --> 37:57.484
Well, the latest intelligence
is that

37:57.650 --> 37:59.611
the fellows were laborers
who had been drinking,

37:59.778 --> 38:01.237
they meant no harm.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.616
You have an answer
for everything.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.494
Well, then I am fortunate

38:07.660 --> 38:08.953
that the puzzles you set me

38:09.120 --> 38:11.247
are so easily resolved.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.204
Sorry, ma'am, was there
something you wanted?

38:33.228 --> 38:34.312
Abigail, shush.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.688
Sit down.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.649
Sit.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.282
How do you like Ireland?

38:48.701 --> 38:51.830
I, I like it very well, ma'am.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.625
The people were very friendly.

38:57.377 --> 39:00.088
Are you convinced by it?

39:04.008 --> 39:05.468
Not entirely, ma'am.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.930
You talk to 'em,

39:09.097 --> 39:12.725
they've all got loved ones
who died of the famine.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.061
Some pretty terrible stories,
really.

39:15.228 --> 39:18.314
It's a wonder they don't hate
our guts being here.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.653
Yes.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.072
I believe the suffering
was very terrible.

39:28.199 --> 39:31.035
The sound of it still echoes,
even here.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.668
Dublin will be a day
of reckoning.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.466
The shamrock dress, I think.

39:45.633 --> 39:49.262
II'

39:58.855 --> 40:01.524
II'

40:03.026 --> 40:04.986
Lady Palmerston.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.364
Some final words of wisdom.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.742
I offer no wisdom, ma'am.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.119
But I presume to advise you
of a sign.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.330
Ronan, the cardinal...

40:15.496 --> 40:17.081
If he speaks sympathetically,

40:17.248 --> 40:21.628
Catholic Ireland will take
a step closer... to us.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.258
I trust I
shall see you in London?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.718
Sometime?

40:28.885 --> 40:32.513
My word on it, ma'am.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.307
Lord Pam,

40:34.474 --> 40:36.726
will you lead us on to Dublin?

40:36.893 --> 40:38.019
Ma'am.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.210
Give my regards
to your mistress.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.779
Westminster.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.656
I know you can't live
without her.

40:49.822 --> 40:55.244
II'

41:08.800 --> 41:12.762
II'

41:28.736 --> 41:30.405
II'

41:59.517 --> 42:03.771
II'

42:08.860 --> 42:09.944
Your Majesty,

42:10.111 --> 42:12.613
may 1 present Bishop Moberly?

42:14.699 --> 42:17.618
And Cardinal Ronan.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.332
Gentlemen.

42:23.499 --> 42:28.129
We cannot fail to observe...
All of us present here today...

42:28.296 --> 42:30.089
That this is a moment
of great poignancy.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.385
I do not mean that
the queen has come to Dublin.

42:34.552 --> 42:39.223
That is something that should
have happened long before now,

42:39.390 --> 42:42.226
and for my lateness,
I apologize.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.354
I mean that in your coming here,

42:45.521 --> 42:47.023
Cardinal Ronan,

42:47.190 --> 42:50.359
you bring your church
to meet with mine.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.405
And I thank you for the honor.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.869
Your Majesty,

43:00.036 --> 43:02.830
my church salutes you in return.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.541
And as an emblem
of determination

43:05.708 --> 43:09.670
that we should all advance
together in peace,

43:09.837 --> 43:12.006
we offer you this gift-.

43:15.426 --> 43:20.306
II'

43:25.812 --> 43:28.272
I have not come to trespass
on the authority

43:28.439 --> 43:29.774
of His Holiness the Pope.

43:31.234 --> 43:33.694
I come only to deliver in person

43:33.861 --> 43:36.906
this pledge:

43:37.073 --> 43:39.909
That shall strive
with all my heart

43:40.076 --> 43:42.411
to help your country recover
the strength it once enjoyed

43:42.578 --> 43:47.125
and deserves to know again.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.419
You have given me a dove.

43:50.586 --> 43:53.047
An Irish dove.

43:53.214 --> 43:56.134
This is her land.

43:56.300 --> 43:59.637
This is where she belongs.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.223
Let us send her home.

44:05.184 --> 44:08.229
II'

44:13.818 --> 44:17.155
II'

44:20.741 --> 44:23.578
II'

44:28.082 --> 44:29.667
Good day.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.919
Now, Bertie.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.401
By God.

44:55.568 --> 44:56.986
We'll make a gentleman
of you yet.

44:57.153 --> 44:58.446
So proud of you.

44:58.613 --> 45:01.699
Mama.

45:01.866 --> 45:02.867
On, Vicky.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.369
Welcome back. Ah.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.788
I believe the expedition
was a success.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.081
Palmerston did everything

45:09.248 --> 45:10.392
within his power
to make it appear

45:10.416 --> 45:12.043
as if everything ran smoothly.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.295
Victoria was persuaded?

45:14.462 --> 45:16.797
A childlike faith
in what she's shown.

45:16.964 --> 45:19.008
Mmm.

45:19.175 --> 45:21.010
Oh, could I trouble you
for something?

45:21.177 --> 45:22.720
There is a gentleman,
a, a cleric,

45:22.887 --> 45:24.972
his name is Hannam. Hannam,

45:25.139 --> 45:26.515
ah, yes, yes.

45:26.682 --> 45:28.309
Oxford man, a Puseyite.

45:28.476 --> 45:29.769
I've read his work.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.439
He would like to become
the Dean of Ely.

45:33.606 --> 45:35.608
Well...

45:35.775 --> 45:37.485
Actually, that's
a rather good fit.

45:37.652 --> 45:38.736
Hmm.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.154
Leave it with me.

45:43.074 --> 45:46.744
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild...

45:46.911 --> 45:48.037
Look upon...

45:49.538 --> 45:51.832
Look upon this little child.

45:51.999 --> 45:56.504
Pity my simplicity,
suffer me to come to thee.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.257
Amen.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.260
What's this?

46:03.344 --> 46:07.598
You've got a rash on your arm.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.183
Good night, Mama.

46:13.312 --> 46:16.816
Good night.

46:16.983 --> 46:22.697
Slept very poorly.

46:22.863 --> 46:24.657
I kept thinking about Bertie.

46:24.824 --> 46:28.035
Yes, he has done very well.

46:28.202 --> 46:31.038
He was so unhappy when
he said his prayers last night.

46:31.205 --> 46:35.126
Yes, well, sometimes I think
we set too much store

46:35.293 --> 46:38.546
on happiness, don't you think?

46:38.713 --> 46:41.048
Whatever do you mean?

46:43.259 --> 46:46.262
Well, um, well, yourself,

46:46.429 --> 46:47.680
Victoria.

46:47.847 --> 46:50.850
What, what makes you happy,
Victoria?

46:51.017 --> 46:52.101
The adoration of a crowd.

46:52.268 --> 46:54.687
Not this again.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.814
In Dublin, you were supreme.

46:56.981 --> 46:59.150
The crowd cheered,
and your heart was lifted.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.610
But, uh, now you are gone.

47:01.777 --> 47:03.612
Will the Catholic Irish
persevere

47:03.779 --> 47:05.448
in their wish to be reacquainted

47:05.614 --> 47:06.907
with their Protestant masters?

47:07.074 --> 47:08.385
Will the masters accept them
or snub them'?

47:08.409 --> 47:09.744
Or would the whole affair,

47:09.910 --> 47:12.747
has it already been consigned
to history?

47:12.913 --> 47:16.334
My presence in Ireland had meaning.
I wish

47:16.500 --> 47:19.712
that I could persuade the Irish
to think and act as you imagine

47:19.879 --> 47:22.923
that they do.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.675
Victoria...

47:27.011 --> 47:30.681
II'

47:58.542 --> 47:59.752
Palmerston,

47:59.919 --> 48:01.045
damn you, look at me!

48:05.049 --> 48:06.759
Have you been rogering my wife?

48:09.595 --> 48:10.888
I have not, sir.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.393
A little less of that, Monmouth,

48:15.559 --> 48:19.271
and you might roghr her yourself
with rather more authority

48:19.438 --> 48:21.565
than you do at present.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.784
I am not mocked, Palmerston.

48:31.951 --> 48:34.245
There will be retribution.

48:40.084 --> 48:41.252
Is that true, Henry?

48:41.419 --> 48:43.087
I was certain that you'd added

48:43.254 --> 48:46.006
the Duchess to
your distinguished collection.

48:46.173 --> 48:49.760
I did not, sir.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.930
On.

48:53.097 --> 48:56.475
II'

49:15.911 --> 49:17.037
Say something.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.542
Ma'am? Not "ma'am."

49:21.709 --> 49:24.170
say...

49:24.336 --> 49:27.047
Something.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.803
Oh, really, half the time
I can't prevent you

49:32.970 --> 49:35.556
from filling the room
with your opinions.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.558
I'm, I'm uncertain...

49:37.725 --> 49:39.727
Dear Turner.

49:39.894 --> 49:41.395
It's not your fault.

49:41.562 --> 49:42.646
<i>Husk...</i>

49:44.773 --> 49:46.613
I wish you felt able
to initiate a conversation

49:46.650 --> 49:48.003
without fretting
about how I might respond.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.070
I think you're right
to be worried

49:50.237 --> 49:51.322
about your son, ma'am.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.240
The household is concerned.

49:53.407 --> 49:54.950
Vocative.

49:57.620 --> 49:58.746
Dative.

50:02.208 --> 50:07.421
II'

50:07.588 --> 50:08.714
Ablative.

50:12.051 --> 50:13.552
1

50:29.568 --> 50:31.779
Get out.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.146
Your Majesty, I beseech you...

50:33.197 --> 50:34.197
Of this house!

50:34.323 --> 50:35.425
Allow me to explain
the method...

50:35.449 --> 50:37.368
Step away, sir.

50:37.535 --> 50:38.577
You shall not threaten

50:38.744 --> 50:39.870
my mother!

50:56.053 --> 50:57.137
You look glum,

50:57.304 --> 51:00.849
Highness.

51:01.016 --> 51:03.561
The tutor has been dismissed.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.938
Inevitably,
I shall get the blame.

51:06.105 --> 51:09.024
I did not know
the child was being persecuted.

51:09.191 --> 51:10.901
How could I?

51:11.068 --> 51:12.987
<i>Because you were
in loco parentis?</i>

51:15.489 --> 51:17.658
That doesn't interest me.

51:17.825 --> 51:20.828
What interests me is this:
The unexpected appointment

51:20.995 --> 51:23.163
of George Hannam as Dean of Ely.

51:23.330 --> 51:28.377
New pearls, madam? Hmm.

51:28.544 --> 51:30.671
You forced me to play my card.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.173
What card is that?

51:33.340 --> 51:34.925
The picture card.

51:35.092 --> 51:38.304
The one that shows you
at Osborne,

51:38.470 --> 51:42.224
attempting to ravish
the Duchess of Monmouth.

51:47.521 --> 51:53.068
Your Serene Highness,
think we might be quits.

52:00.367 --> 52:02.161
II'

52:02.328 --> 52:03.329
I wanted to be

52:03.495 --> 52:07.041
a good father.

52:07.207 --> 52:10.127
I kn ow.

52:10.294 --> 52:12.630
To make such a
catastrophic error in judgment,

52:12.796 --> 52:16.925
it is inexcusable.

52:17.092 --> 52:22.890
Thank God we have
no more children for me to...

52:23.057 --> 52:24.433
damage.

52:28.062 --> 52:33.233
As ever,
my timing is impeccable.

52:45.162 --> 52:48.415
Are you sure?

52:48.582 --> 52:49.750
Seventh time of asking.

52:49.917 --> 52:53.587
I'm familiar
with the indications.

52:56.256 --> 52:59.009
Liebes, I...

52:59.176 --> 53:01.595
I congratulate you.

53:04.139 --> 53:08.143
II'

53:12.481 --> 53:15.401
I am glad
we shall have another child.

53:23.534 --> 53:24.743
Albert,

53:24.910 --> 53:27.788
shall we survive this?

53:32.584 --> 53:35.087
I love you.

53:36.714 --> 53:38.507
We shall try.
