00:01.869 --> 00:04.172
ADULT ADAM: Back in the day,
a lot could be said
about my crazy family.

00:04.238 --> 00:08.709
The one thing that
couldn't be denied was
that we were bad drivers.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.778
But, despite the highway havoc
that we wreaked

00:10.844 --> 00:13.247
and the fender benders that
followed us wherever we went,

00:13.314 --> 00:16.717
no one was more psyched
to get behind the wheel
than my brother, Barry.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.453
When he turned 16,
he couldn't wait
to hit the open road

00:19.520 --> 00:21.189
and never look back.
(BOX JINGLES)

00:21.255 --> 00:22.923
It's jingling.
It's keys!

00:22.990 --> 00:26.060
Until my mom put the brakes
on his automotive dreams.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.528
What the hell is this?

00:27.595 --> 00:29.430
It's a locket.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.199
It's got
my picture inside

00:31.265 --> 00:34.702
so you can always have
your mother near your heart.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.070
And so, when I turned 16,

00:36.137 --> 00:38.672
my mom's gift to me
was hardly a surprise.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.707
(BOX JINGLES)

00:39.773 --> 00:41.942
It's jingling.
Jingling means keys.

00:42.009 --> 00:45.679
It was the sterling-silver
Mom locket that
all the Goldberg boys got.

00:45.746 --> 00:46.947
I put my picture in there

00:47.014 --> 00:49.617
so you can always have
your mama near your heart.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.153
Yes! He got
the worst gift, too.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.222
I love it.
Thank you, Mama.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.190
Wait.
That's your reaction?

00:56.257 --> 00:59.593
You get a garbage locket
of Mom instead of a car,
and you appreciate it?

00:59.660 --> 01:01.362
Yeah, I'm good
with not getting a car.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.097
Or driving in general.
You get it.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.499
No! I don't get it at all!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.201
I've got no sense
of direction,

01:07.268 --> 01:09.437
I have bad depth perception
due to my lazy eye,

01:09.503 --> 01:11.372
and I'm easily startled
by birds.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.673
So you're just
not gonna drive?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.442
Yeah, I'm not so much
a driver

01:14.508 --> 01:16.610
as the guy who sits behind
the driver in the backseat.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.546
You mean a rich guy?
Exactly.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.115
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have play practice.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.650
Father, go fetch
your driving pants,

01:22.716 --> 01:24.652
which are just regular pants
you refuse to wear.

01:24.718 --> 01:27.221
ADULT ADAM:
Refusing to drive
baffled my whole family,

01:27.288 --> 01:28.889
but no one more
than Barry.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.424
Back when he got his license,

01:30.491 --> 01:32.393
the dude trademarked
his own dance.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.827
* Yeah, that's right

01:33.894 --> 01:36.096
* Barry's driving
Who's in charge?

01:36.164 --> 01:38.999
* I'm in charge
That's right, uh-huh

01:39.066 --> 01:40.401
* Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

01:40.468 --> 01:42.470
Unreal.
I raised a moron.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.806
ADULT ADAM: But, lucky for me,
I got the perfect
birthday present that year...

01:45.873 --> 01:48.108
The gift of never driving.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.544
Stop it. My scrumptious
little baby-man

01:50.611 --> 01:53.281
does not have to
learn to drive until
he's absolutely ready.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.616
That's a no!
Victory-dance time!

01:55.683 --> 01:56.917
* Mm-mm-mm

01:56.984 --> 01:58.686
* Uh-uh-uh-uh, yeah

01:58.752 --> 02:00.554
* That's right
I'm not driving *

02:00.621 --> 02:03.357
Hey! Stop copying
my driving dance!

02:03.424 --> 02:05.426
I'm not.
It's the not-driving dance.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.560
There's no such thing!

02:06.627 --> 02:08.396
I'm raising
complete morons.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.164
It's getting hard to argue.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.732
It's like this.
No, it's like this.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.467
If you're gonna copy me,
at least do it the right way.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.169
It's my own thing, dude.
Face it, this dance is mine.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.904
**

02:16.970 --> 02:18.439
* I'm twisted up inside

02:18.506 --> 02:22.176
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:24.478 --> 02:25.979
* I don't know the future

02:26.046 --> 02:30.318
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:30.384 --> 02:32.820
ADULT ADAM: It was
November 29, 1980-something.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.588
The college fair
was in full swing,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.624
and my sister
wanted no part of it.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.060
Ugh, look at all these bozos
and their lame clubs.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.630
The whole point
of going to college
is to be left alone.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.432
I thought it was more,
like, to learn and grow

02:44.498 --> 02:45.866
and make
lifelong friendships.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.568
Meh. I've got
enough friends.
Do you?

02:47.635 --> 02:49.603
Hey, either of you interested
in Ultimate Frisbee?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.172
Are you interested in picking
a sport with a ball?

02:53.173 --> 02:54.342
Maybe you should
join a club

02:54.408 --> 02:55.576
for freshmen
who hate everything.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.211
Great. Where's that table?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.746
Seriously,
you're a total downer.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.214
You, like,
pooh-pooh everything.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.682
I don't, like,
pooh-pooh everything.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.484
Just offer me something cool,
and I'm there.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.453
Looking for
something cool, eh?

03:05.519 --> 03:09.223
Lucky for you, your RA Srini
has the answer, ladies.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.625
Karaoke and togas? Pass.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.327
I see. Well, if you
change your mind,

03:13.394 --> 03:14.795
feel free to drop by
and RSVP.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.564
Here's my RSVP. Pbht!

03:16.630 --> 03:18.832
Guess that's an RSVP
for just one, then.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.368
Wait, you're going? Why?

03:20.434 --> 03:22.870
'Cause it sounds fun,
and, unlike you,
I, like, like fun.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.738
I, like, like fun, too!

03:24.805 --> 03:27.241
You should've seen me
in high school.
I was, like, the funnest.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.942
Ow!

03:29.009 --> 03:31.279
Hey, isn't there
some weird field
that you can play in?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.580
Hi, Craig.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.014

03:34.081 --> 03:35.182
Gah! Barry?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.450
Hey, I drank
all your 5 Alive.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.751
What are you doing here?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.019
Hello?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.555
It's my college tour!
I told you like 10 times!

03:42.155 --> 03:43.657
I knew that, silly.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.459
I just lost track
of the days

03:45.526 --> 03:47.528
with all the awesome
parties and whatnot.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.062
There's so many parties.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.498
Which are all
totally real,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.032
because I am
killing it here.
(CHUCKLES)

03:52.099 --> 03:55.436
Dude, this weekend is
gonna be the stuff of legend!

03:55.503 --> 03:56.770
So, where's
the first rager at?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.406
ADULT ADAM: But Erica
only knew of one,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.173
that she already passed on.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.810
Srini!
Nice toga, my man!

04:02.876 --> 04:04.978
I changed my mind
about your kareoga thing.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.047
Did you, now?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.182
See, my brother's here,
and I kinda told him that
I'm the queen of college,

04:09.249 --> 04:13.153
so you can see why I now
have a sudden interest
in your crappy party.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.922
Just party. Not crappy.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.158
That is the single worst
RSVP ever.
And it's been declined.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.693
What? You can't decline!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.929
You're my RA.
You have to include me.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.163
Farewell.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.065
So that's a yes?

04:25.132 --> 04:27.701
ADULT ADAM:
As Erica was realizing
she'd driven everyone away,

04:27.768 --> 04:30.203
my dad was trying
to get me to drive.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.905
I... Hey! My BurgerTime!

04:31.972 --> 04:33.140
Okay, moron.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.608
Lose the disturbing
"Mom" necklace,

04:34.675 --> 04:35.776
take these keys.

how to drive.

Ooh. I'd love to,
but the ol' ball n' chain

04:39.847 --> 04:41.715
says I'll learn when
I'm ready, know
what I'm sayin'?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.016
I say you're ready
right now.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.585
But what about
all the horrible things

04:44.652 --> 04:46.454
Mom says will happen
if I don't drive good?

04:46.520 --> 04:49.523
What horrible things?
I could get a stop sign
through the heart!

04:49.590 --> 04:51.325
Or a guard rail
through the heart!

04:51.392 --> 04:53.394
Or a mailbox
through the heart!

04:53.461 --> 04:55.863
Why are all these things
going through your heart?
That's not even possible.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.399
Tell that to Mom's
friend Sheila's nephew.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.933
He was driving
at dangerous speeds,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.337
and he flipped his car
and got a mailbox...

05:03.404 --> 05:05.072
Okay, you gotta
stop listening

05:05.138 --> 05:07.040
to these crazy things
your mom tells you.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.577
So rabid pigeons
won't peck my eyes out
through the sunroof?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.311
What is it with you
and birds anyway?

05:11.379 --> 05:12.713
They're just so cocky.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.915
So what if they can fly?
I can do stuff, too.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.149
Like driving?

05:16.216 --> 05:18.419
I bet you that would really
make the birdies jealous.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.388
Yeah, right. Like birds
know what a car is.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.322
Get in the car!

05:22.390 --> 05:24.792
ADULT ADAM: With that,
my dad left me with
no choice but to drive.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.095
The only problem was, I'd have
to get in the car first.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.262
I... I can't do it.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.098

07:42.530 --> 07:44.598
Let me take this.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.366
I was out teaching him
how to drive.

07:46.433 --> 07:47.568
The (BLEEP) you say?

07:47.635 --> 07:48.802
Good for you, kiddo!

07:48.869 --> 07:50.638
No, no.
It was not so good.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.872
As a matter of fact,
it was worse

07:51.939 --> 07:53.140
than any of us
could have imagined.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.643
I ruined the car!
He ruined the car?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.044
Not great.
Oh, my God.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.547
Please tell me you made
him wear a seatbelt.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.181
Technically,
I didn't get that far.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.151
Doesn't matter.
You always wear a seatbelt.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.953
Why?
Because of
the road pirates.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.788
What the hell
are road pirates?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.957
They're like sea pirates,
but instead of other ships,

08:10.023 --> 08:11.925
they plunder mid-sized
sedans and hatchbacks.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.460
That's right.
Without a belt,

08:13.527 --> 08:14.928
they'll just reach
into the window

08:14.995 --> 08:16.664
and yank you
out of the car.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.766
What are these words?
What are you teaching him
when I'm not around?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.701
The good news is,
I've officially decided

08:20.768 --> 08:22.369
I'm not ready
to drive this year.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.838
Adam, you are
my little cookie.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.074
My scrumptious
oatmeal-nibble man.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.743
If you're not ready
for the next three
decades, so be it.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.444
Your little cookie
thanks you, Mama.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.013
Here's a little crumb.
Mwah.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.582
Oh, I could just
eat you up.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.283
It's easy, 'cause
I'm a soft-baked cookie.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.718
Oh, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom!

08:37.785 --> 08:38.919
Nom, nom, nom, nom!

08:38.986 --> 08:40.153
Nom, nom, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom!

08:40.220 --> 08:42.122
Oh...
Just go!

08:42.189 --> 08:43.824
(LAUGHS) Nom, nom!

08:43.891 --> 08:45.325
What the hell
did you do, Murray?

08:45.392 --> 08:46.727
I finally agree with you.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.228
That kid
should never drive,

08:48.295 --> 08:50.363
and he should stay
your little baby forever.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.199
No! Adam needs to drive!

08:52.265 --> 08:54.167
Then what's with
the cookie business?

08:54.234 --> 08:55.569
And the road pirates?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.105
I spent the last five years
scaring Adam with my stories

08:58.171 --> 09:02.442
so he'd be
a... A super terrified,
very cautious driver.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.044
Now's the time
for you to swoop in

09:04.111 --> 09:06.446
and call him a moron
until he learns to drive.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.881
Wait, that's your plan?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.583
Worked perfectly
for Erica and Barry.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.418
I don't know
what went wrong here.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.321
I have a theory.
Your stories didn't
teach him to be cautious.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.557
They just terrified a very
gullible, anxious child.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.794
No one wants your objective
opinions based on facts, Dad.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.663
We'll handle it, Al.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.732
ADULT ADAM:
With that, my parents
shut down my grandfather,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.600
who went upstairs
and bribed me to drive.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.435
Okey dokey,
it's happening.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.603
We'll see you
in a few hours.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.071
What?
Where are you going?

09:31.138 --> 09:33.206
To take the kid out driving,
just like we agreed.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.541
Uh, no.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.710
You had your driver's license
taken away, remember?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.679
So? Doesn't mean
I can't still drive.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.380
That's exactly
what it means.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.982
Wait, are you still driving?

09:42.049 --> 09:44.284
Sure. How else do you think
I get here every day?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.486
The bus. You told us
you took the bus.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.789
Why would I do that?
I got a car.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.223
Did you know
about this?

09:50.290 --> 09:51.892
Of course. We have crazy
adventures every week.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.627
How do you think
we get there?

09:53.694 --> 09:56.063
Oh, my God, Dad!
It's not safe for you
behind the wheel!

09:56.129 --> 09:57.865
You crashed
into a drive-through!

09:57.931 --> 09:59.900
What crash?
It was a nudge.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.468
We both know
it wasn't a nudge.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.604
I nudged it.
In fact, I don't even
think I touched it.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.339
This is becoming
a whole thing.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.276
I'm gonna rain check,
but we can pick this up
again in a few years.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.178
No! No rain checks!

10:11.244 --> 10:14.281
Your hero Pops is gonna
teach you how to drive.
End of story!

10:14.347 --> 10:16.583
ADULT ADAM: Finally!
Things are looking up.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.785
But we're coming, too.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.853
Nope!
They sucked again.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.258
It was Barry's
first day at college,
and people were noticing.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.728
Turns out
being overly confident
and unembarrassable

10:27.795 --> 10:33.466
got him mocked in high school,
but in college, he quickly
became the life of the party.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.736
Gah! It's been three hours.
Can we just go?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.170
For sure. We got
a ton of stuff to do.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.907
Stuff? What Stuff?
Delta Nu has a pig roast,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.642
and I got invited
to a kareoga party.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.078
Wait, isn't that
in your dorm?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.647
Uh, yeah, but no one's going
to that weird-ass party.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.683
Yo! It's my boy Srini!

10:49.750 --> 10:50.951
Question about
your party...

10:51.018 --> 10:52.219
No, no, no!
No questions!

10:52.285 --> 10:54.154
Wait, you know this girl,
Big Tasty?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.488
She's my sister.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.257
Ah, she sucks at first,
but you'll come to love her.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
We're currently still
in the sucking phase.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.828
Oh, my God!
What world am I living in?

11:00.894 --> 11:02.629
Fine. Since you're
related to Big Tasty,

11:02.696 --> 11:05.298
I'm willing to overlook
your extremely hurtful words

11:05.365 --> 11:06.900
and re-invite you
to my soiree.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.368
You hear that, Erica?

11:08.435 --> 11:10.670
He's gonna ignore
how terrible you are.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.239
Forget it!
You can just go.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.107
If some stupid party
is more important

11:14.174 --> 11:16.509
than your own
flesh and blood,
then have a blast.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.745
I will! Thanks!

11:17.811 --> 11:19.346
Who wants snow cones?

11:19.412 --> 11:23.216
Ow! Okay, now I know you're
clearly doing it on purpose!

11:23.283 --> 11:24.785
ADULT ADAM:
While Erica felt burned,

11:24.852 --> 11:26.820
I was the one
hoping not to crash.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.722
You're doing
great, kiddo.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.824
Just keep going
on Rydal Road.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.593
No, Dad. Rydal Road
intersects the train tracks.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.762
Wait, a train's coming?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.964
No!
Maybe, maybe.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.565
Look for the flashing
red lights

11:38.631 --> 11:40.467
and the up-and-down-gate
thingy.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.036
Oy vey, Bev.
There is no train.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.339
Essie Karp's pool man thought
the same thing until... Boom!

11:46.406 --> 11:48.876
His truck was T-boned
by a commuter train.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.378
Now he holds the skimmer
with a homemade clamp.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.679
Homemade clamp?

11:52.746 --> 11:54.381
It's attached
to his shoulder.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.150
He opens and shuts it
with wires
he keeps in his mouth.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.753
No arm part?
Just a clamp and a shoulder?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.288
Pulleys.
It works very well.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
Wouldn't he just
choose a different career

12:03.356 --> 12:04.992
if he had
a homemade clamp?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.995
Skimming is his life, Murray.
It's what he knows.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.696
It's what he knows!

12:09.763 --> 12:12.165
Everything
you're saying right now
is very distracting.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.467
Wait, if the clamp gets wet,
doesn't it get rusty?

12:14.534 --> 12:18.205
Of course it gets rusty.
He works around
water and metal.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.140
That's why he wears
a bag over the clamp.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.410
Ah, come on, there's gotta be
a better way to clean pools

12:23.476 --> 12:25.545
than a homemade clamp
with a bag over it.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.880
He's a very
determined man!

12:26.947 --> 12:28.748
Please drop it already.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.250
You know he cleans
gutters in the fall?

12:30.317 --> 12:32.252
He just swaps in a scooper
for the clamp.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.954
Scoop?
What kind of scooper?
(LAUGHS)

12:34.021 --> 12:36.656
He scoops
with a homemade ladle.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.859
He scoops out
all the gutters.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.428
So he's scooping gutters
with a homemade ladle?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.496
He scoops and skims!
You expect me
to believe that?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.966
He scoops in the fall
and skims in the summer!
Scoops and skims.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.734
* So, come on

12:47.801 --> 12:52.739
* Take a bottle, shake it up

12:52.806 --> 12:58.345
* Break the bubble,
break it up

12:58.411 --> 13:00.313
CROWD: (MUFFLED)
* Pour some sugar on me

13:00.380 --> 13:03.483
Enough with the sugar
and the pouring!
Turn it down!

13:03.550 --> 13:05.886
Wow, you're, like,
really harshing on
Def Leppard right now.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.188
I can't believe
you're actually going
to that dumb party.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.957
Totally, and I'm, like,
super bummed

13:10.023 --> 13:11.491
you're not
gonna be there.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.493
Well, you don't have
to be sarcastic about it.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.596
I'm, like, not.
This is just how I talk.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.465
Okay, screw this!

13:18.531 --> 13:21.201
There's no way I'll let
my brother be better
at college than me.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.838
It's time to show 'em
how it's done.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.542
* I once was lost

13:29.609 --> 13:31.644
ADULT ADAM:
So Erica would
prove she could kill it,

13:31.711 --> 13:34.381
by literally murdering
all the fun out of the party.

13:34.447 --> 13:41.188
* ...was blind,
but now I see *

13:44.557 --> 13:45.859
(MAN COUGHS)

13:46.960 --> 13:49.562
Okay!

13:49.629 --> 13:53.000
Let's keep this party going!
Who's up next?

13:53.066 --> 13:54.567
I was gonna
sing The Go-Go's,

13:54.634 --> 13:57.004
but I didn't realize this
party is religious-themed.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.538
What? No. (CHUCKLES)

13:58.605 --> 14:00.273
That's just a beautiful song
that showcases my voice.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.209
Oh.
Job well done, then.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.244
Oh, she's not being mean.
That's just how she talks.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.613
No, this time, it was
totally meant to be mean.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.847
(GASPS)

14:07.915 --> 14:10.483
Come on, Erica,
don't go! Come on.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.886
What's the point?
I can't win here.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.454
What am I supposed to do?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.924
Use your stupid
bag of college?
This is nuts.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.858
Hey, mon,
I'm Barry Goldberg.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.193
I have
a see-through dog,

14:20.260 --> 14:22.129
and I ride a unicycle
with a stick.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.131
Or how about
a Snoopy snow cone

14:24.197 --> 14:26.299
while I strap on
breakdancing pants

14:26.366 --> 14:28.735
and wear this captain's hat
for some reason?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.904
Okay, when you use them
all at once,
you just look silly.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.572
(CLATTERS)
Don't you get it, dude?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.342
No one likes me here.
I don't even like me here.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.178
Then it's time you
show them the Erica
we all knew back home.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.981
How? High school
was so easy.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.050
I didn't even have to try
to make friends.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.318
I get it.
It's new, and it's scary.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.520
But I guarantee, if you
put yourself out there,

14:47.587 --> 14:49.589
everyone will love
the real Erica Goldberg.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.425
How do I introduce everyone
to the real me?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.527
Mmm, I got a plan.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.596
MURRAY: So he's scooping.
BEVERLY: He scoops.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.199
MURRAY: I'm sorry,
what's you're saying,
science fiction!

14:59.266 --> 15:00.900
You just made
all this crap up.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.769
I didn't. I...
Oh, yeah, you did.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.371
I'm not that creative.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.940
Oh, yeah, scooping
with a ladle, I'd argue,
is very creative.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.841
Listen, listen.
Listen to me.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.643
Please drop it already!

15:10.710 --> 15:13.913
It's doubters like you
that make him want
to skim harder.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.382
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out Pops was right.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.450
My dad's nagging pressure
to make me drive,

15:17.517 --> 15:20.087
coupled with my mom's
constant car-safety stories,

15:20.153 --> 15:22.189
weren't exactly prepping me
for the road.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.856
I was in full panic mode.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.959
Stop talking about
clamps and pool men.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.760
Here come the train tracks.
What do I do?

15:27.827 --> 15:28.996
Just drive, moron.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.098
He's right. I am a moron.
Grab the wheel.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.968
No! Ignore your dad
and the pool-guy story.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.038
I don't see flashing lights
or gates lowering.
What if it's broken?

15:38.105 --> 15:40.107
Just punch it, kiddo.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.010
Balls!

15:46.946 --> 15:48.848
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You did it!

15:48.915 --> 15:49.949
He did it!

15:50.017 --> 15:51.651
I did it!
You were right, Pops.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.986
This whole driving thing
isn't so...

15:53.053 --> 15:54.621
(TIRES SCREECHING)

15:59.726 --> 16:03.396
Well, that was a little more
than a nudge.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.669
ADULT ADAM: Pops was
an excellent driving teacher.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.239
Unfortunately,
I was not a great student.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.675
Surprising amount of paperwork
for a tiny, little nudge.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.277
Dad, we T-boned a cop.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.446
And you told him to stop
making a big deal out of it.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.315
I think that cop had
something going on at home.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.316
**

16:23.383 --> 16:26.186
Okay,
first things first.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.721
Give me your keys, Al.
No more driving.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.558
How is this on me?
Adam was behind the wheel.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.561
You know how it works.
It's the circle of driving.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.330
Somebody loses a license,
someone gets a license.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.699
Or, Pops keeps driving,
'cause I'm not.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.768
See? The circle of driving
ends with me.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.870
The circle of driving
does not end with you.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.638
Or...

16:45.705 --> 16:47.440
Pops keeps driving,
'cause I'm not.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.076
See? The circle of driving
ends with me.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.710
You can't end
the circle of driving.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.845
Oh, I just did!
The circle is complete!

16:52.912 --> 16:56.783
Listen, Cookie Bite.
I know
you're scared to drive.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.118
But you shouldn't be.

16:58.185 --> 17:02.589
Truth is, I might've
slightly exaggerated

17:02.655 --> 17:04.191
the safety of
the highways and byways,

17:04.257 --> 17:06.459
just to make sure
you were safe.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.428
So I won't stall out
on train tracks

17:08.495 --> 17:10.197
and end up cleaning pools
with my face?

17:10.263 --> 17:12.665
Not if you get
regular oil changes
and fill up your car...

17:12.732 --> 17:14.301
Beverly.
Sorry.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.968
Train tracks are fine.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.804
Murray?
What about you?

17:17.870 --> 17:18.905
What about me?

17:18.971 --> 17:20.607
Well,
maybe you apologize

17:20.673 --> 17:23.009
for always calling
the kid a moron.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.611
(GRUMBLES)

17:27.147 --> 17:30.217
Aw. That's the nicest sound
you ever made at me.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.652
Even morons can drive.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.521
Especially you.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.389
**

17:38.024 --> 17:39.559
Um, hey.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.628
I thought we could
keep kareoga going.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.263
Um, we're good,
Whitney Houston.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.932
Look, I just wanted
people to like me.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.269
Then, when they didn't,
I acted judgey and showed off.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.838
Maybe I can
make up for it?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.374
Okay.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.177
Hey, everybody,
I'm Erica.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.748
I'm also
Big Tasty's sister.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.651
ALL: (CHEERING) Big Tasty!
Mmm-hmm.

18:04.717 --> 18:08.054
Anyway, I hear part of kareoga
is singing along,

18:08.121 --> 18:10.157
so join in if you want.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.659
(PLAYING
POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME)

18:15.862 --> 18:18.731
* Love is like a bomb, baby,
come on, get it on

18:18.798 --> 18:21.668
* Livin' like a lover
with a radar phone

18:21.734 --> 18:24.637
* Lookin' like a tramp,
like a video vamp

18:24.704 --> 18:28.275
* I'm a demolition woman,
will you be my man

18:31.043 --> 18:33.213
(GUITAR STRUMMING)

18:33.813 --> 18:36.048
**

18:36.115 --> 18:37.750
Hey, Pops?
Got a second?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.186
Sure thing, kiddo.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.988
Listen, I was thinking...

18:42.054 --> 18:43.890
Maybe Mom and Dad
are right.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.826
Maybe it's time
for you to stop driving.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.195
For real this time.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.263
Your parents
put you up to this?

18:50.330 --> 18:53.065
No. This time,
it's coming from me.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.068
I know Mom drilled car safety
into my head and all,

18:56.135 --> 18:59.172
but I think, in your case,
you really should listen.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.841
Adam, I can't
just stop driving.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.478
I mean, how are we gonna go
on all our crazy adventures?

19:05.545 --> 19:08.114
Easy. I'll drive us.
You?

19:08.181 --> 19:12.051
If getting my license
means I get to keep
hanging out with you,

19:12.118 --> 19:13.553
then I'm all in.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.656
You'd do that for me?

19:16.723 --> 19:18.758
Then I guess
these are yours now.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.928
(KEYS JINGLING)

19:21.994 --> 19:23.230
(CLATTERS)

19:23.296 --> 19:25.298
I'll work on that.
Come here.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.868
ADULT ADAM: And with that,
the circle of driving
was finally complete.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.804
ERICA: * Shake it up

19:31.871 --> 19:37.277
* Break the bubble,
break it up

19:37.344 --> 19:41.348
ALL:
* Pour some sugar on me

19:41.414 --> 19:43.082
* In the name of love

19:43.149 --> 19:46.353
* Pour some sugar on me

19:46.419 --> 19:48.955
* Come on, fire me up

19:49.021 --> 19:50.490
ADULT ADAM:
There's nothing harder in life

19:50.557 --> 19:51.991
than facing
what scares you most.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.893
Sometimes you just need
a little nudge

19:53.960 --> 19:56.195
to get behind the wheel
and hit the gas.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.664
Drive safe, moron.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.799
And when your family's
along for the ride,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.702
nothing you can't do,
nowhere you can't go.

20:02.769 --> 20:03.970
ERICA: * Listen

20:04.036 --> 20:06.373
* Red light, yellow light,
green-alight, go

20:06.439 --> 20:08.975
* Sweet dream, saccharine,
loosen up

20:09.041 --> 20:12.645
ADULT ADAM: That magic night,
Erica finally found
her place at college.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.682
And I found that history
had a way of repeating itself.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.584
I know you're bummed
about giving up driving,

20:17.650 --> 20:19.852
so I thought this place
would cheer you up.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.522
**

20:22.589 --> 20:24.291
You know me well, kiddo.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.158
Oh, hell no!

20:26.225 --> 20:28.661
We're going
to the Spaghetti Warehouse
across the street.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.397
Don't even look
at this place.

20:30.463 --> 20:34.467
ALL:
* Pour some sugar on me

20:34.534 --> 20:36.403
* Oh, in the name of love

20:36.469 --> 20:39.506
* Pour some sugar on me

20:39.572 --> 20:42.742
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
all it takes is finding
the courage to crank it up,

20:42.809 --> 20:45.278
hit the road,
and keep on driving.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.281
* I'm hot, sticky sweet

20:48.348 --> 20:51.418
* From my head to my feet,
yeah

20:51.484 --> 20:54.120
(POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME

for breakfast?

21:12.238 --> 21:13.205
Privacy!

21:13.272 --> 21:15.174
Oh, please.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.076
Don't forget
to wash your bottom.

Happy birthday, Schmoo.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.250
What do you want
for breakfast?

21:24.317 --> 21:26.453
How's about
some pancake dippers?

21:28.254 --> 21:30.690
Don't forget
to wash your bottom.
ADAM: On it!
