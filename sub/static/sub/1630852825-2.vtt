00:20.145 --> 00:22.731
Starting my own company suited me.

00:22.814 --> 00:26.693
I guess I really enjoyed
being, what, 24, 25, 26,

00:26.776 --> 00:31.656
having ten people working for me who are,
I mean, some of them were twice my age.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.701
It felt very satisfying to me.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.619
How do you think you were able to do that?

00:37.245 --> 00:40.749
Mmm… I always thought
one of my biggest assets was,

00:40.832 --> 00:42.959
I can see a talented person

00:43.043 --> 00:46.087
and remove the personality
from the professional qualities.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.548
What do you mean by--

00:48.631 --> 00:51.342
It's like, I don't need
to like you as a person

00:51.426 --> 00:53.845
but if I see you would be good in a role

00:53.928 --> 00:56.514
and do good work
and fit well with the team,

00:56.598 --> 00:58.641
it doesn't really matter
how you are as a person.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.269
Like, I don't have to be
friends with everyone.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.521
You're like that too.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.232
Maybe.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.943
But not everything is transactional.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.739
I do have friends, as do you.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.534
In fact, I'm meeting with one today. Val.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.622
Val? God. Why are you meeting with Val?

01:21.414 --> 01:24.501
To get a perspective of you
from someone who knew you before…

01:25.251 --> 01:26.419
all this.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.047
When you were
the new kid in town, and all that.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.591
We hardly knew each other.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.093
Is there someone else?

01:34.177 --> 01:36.763
Someone better to shed light
on who you were before?

01:36.846 --> 01:40.558
You think that there was some evolution,
like in the movies or whatever,

01:40.642 --> 01:42.977
but I was always who I am.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.022
Maybe it would help
the both of us going forward

01:46.105 --> 01:49.108
if you stop thinking
about me like everyone else.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.277
Like basic, you know?

02:22.767 --> 02:24.394
Don't you dare move.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.065
You look so amazing.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.442
I want to murder your parents.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.111
- We're ready.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.083
Look, I live fashion. I am fashion.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.334
I meet a lot of fame-hungry,

02:48.418 --> 02:51.087
new money rich girls
of Instagram who want to be socialites.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.465
Who want to be cool.
Who want! Social climbers.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.675
Thirsty people.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.677
Anna Delvey was not thirsty.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.888
Anna Delvey was the real deal.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.556
How do you know that exactly?

03:01.639 --> 03:03.099
It's in the details.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.935
Okay, you are wearing

03:06.019 --> 03:08.313
what I'm guessing
you think is a really nice dress.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.232
But I can tell that it's a knock-off,
and not a good one.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.902
The fabric is cheap,
the print doesn't match at the seams,

03:13.985 --> 03:15.528
the bag cost something,

03:15.612 --> 03:18.239
but no one's mistaking
you for the Park Avenue,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.241
Swiss boarding school, trust fund life.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.912
Plus, the shoes…
I mean, they make me sad for you.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.079
Who made you wear those--

03:25.163 --> 03:27.373
- I get it.
- Details.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.834
So what were Anna's details?

03:29.918 --> 03:30.793
Anna?

03:37.634 --> 03:39.218
<i>That bitch was flawless.</i>

03:41.638 --> 03:44.390
<i>People like that are born with taste.</i>

03:46.434 --> 03:49.437
<i>I don't mean fashion sense.</i>
<i>I mean real taste.</i>

03:51.439 --> 03:53.149
<i>Anna was understated.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:56.402
<i>Elegant. Alaïa. Balenciaga. Dior.</i>

03:57.737 --> 04:00.323
<i>She knew all the right things</i>
<i>to say and do.</i>

04:09.374 --> 04:12.627
<i>Anna was never "Let's eat at Mr. Chow."</i>

04:12.710 --> 04:13.878
<i>Shudder. No, no, no.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:17.131
<i>Anna knows</i>
<i>that excellent salmon is at Lucien.</i>

04:17.215 --> 04:20.843
<i>That back in the day, the best dish</i>
<i>at The Waverley was the Amish chicken.</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:23.137
<i>Not anymore. Now it's disgusting.</i>

04:23.221 --> 04:24.931
<i>But then, Anna knew.</i>

04:25.014 --> 04:26.182
<i>And wine.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:27.934
Cheers!

04:28.017 --> 04:29.769
<i>You can always tell</i>
<i>by the wine order.</i>

04:29.852 --> 04:32.689
<i>New money</i>
<i>always gets the most expensive bottle.</i>

04:33.690 --> 04:36.317
<i>Anna ordered like generational wealth.</i>

04:36.401 --> 04:38.319
<i>Regions, years.</i>

04:38.403 --> 04:39.904
Anna belonged.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.781
Anna was society.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.493
And you two were close friends?

04:45.576 --> 04:48.246
Anna was cold and unapproachable.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.540
<i>Always unavailable. She never texted back.</i>

04:50.623 --> 04:52.542
<i>She didn't care what other people thought</i>

04:52.625 --> 04:55.169
<i>and she wasn't interested</i>
<i>in anybody else but herself.</i>

04:56.379 --> 04:57.338
<i>And she was mean.</i>

04:58.339 --> 04:59.799
<i>I was dying to be her friend.</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:01.926
<i>I was desperate for her.</i>

05:02.593 --> 05:03.970
<i>And that was her gift.</i>

05:04.053 --> 05:05.930
<i>Anna Delvey was a queen bitch.</i>

05:06.014 --> 05:09.684
<i>But the way that she did it made you feel</i>
<i>like she was Queen Bitch for a reason.</i>

05:09.767 --> 05:12.312
That's why she had Chase
obsessed with her from day one.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.314
- Chase?
- Chase.

05:15.064 --> 05:18.318
- Chase. Her boyfriend.
- Wait, her boyfriend?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.320
Girl, how do you not know about Chase?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.906
"Everyone else is woke but Chase is wake"?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.870
Twenty-six years.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.624
That's how much time
the average person spends sleeping.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.919
Twenty-six years of nights.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.464
Twenty-six years of dreams.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.676
Twenty-six years
filled with thoughts and ideas,

05:43.760 --> 05:45.845
meaning and magic, nightmares.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.263
And wonders.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.017
But when you wake up in the morning,

05:51.100 --> 05:54.854
when the sun rises,
all it takes is a minute or two and then…

05:55.438 --> 05:59.233
All of that knowledge just dissolves.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.569
Disappears. Gone.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.529
Lost.

06:04.989 --> 06:05.990
Imagine.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.328
What if instead of losing that time
you could tap into it?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.663
Actually understand your subconscious.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.792
What if we could understand
the subconscious of an entire nation?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.419
What could we do with that knowledge?

06:18.503 --> 06:20.379
Would we be more connected?

06:21.297 --> 06:23.883
Could a city on one side
of the globe feel community

06:23.966 --> 06:25.718
with a city on the other side of the globe

06:25.802 --> 06:29.388
simply by understanding
one another's hopes and fears and dreams?

06:29.472 --> 06:32.308
Could one country
learn more clearly from another?

06:32.391 --> 06:34.894
Could we predict an uprising?

06:35.686 --> 06:38.147
A war? A pandemic? A genocide?

06:39.524 --> 06:44.112
I'm asking you,
what if I could cloud source your dreams?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.501
Wait, wait, wait. Who the fuck is Chase?

06:58.584 --> 07:00.920
Wait, no. Hold on, that's not the point.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.255
You say Val loves Anna?

07:02.338 --> 07:03.923
Adores. Worships.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.092
Then some serious shit
must have gone down.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.469
Because why did he erase
every public memory of her?

07:08.553 --> 07:09.470
Wait, what…

07:10.304 --> 07:11.514
How do you even--

07:11.597 --> 07:13.599
It's all laid out in the 'gram.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.269
Well, Lou's pissing himself
because he used Instagram.

07:16.352 --> 07:20.148
- We're very proud of him.
- LOL. STFU.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.024
- You researching my story?
- No.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.276
You're helping.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.695
I don't need help.
Landon gave me two weeks.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.822
- Show her what we have.
- Okay, so…

07:27.905 --> 07:30.658
We put together every one of Anna's posts

07:30.741 --> 07:34.620
and Anna's friends' posts
and we get the Anna timeline.

07:34.704 --> 07:39.667
2011, Anna Sorokin
leaves her home in Germany

07:39.750 --> 07:43.379
to attend a fashion program
at Central Saint Martins in London.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.840
Ditches it immediately for Paris.

07:45.923 --> 07:50.428
2013, Ms. Delvey is an intern
working at <i>Purple</i> magazine.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.430
When exactly does she <i>become</i> Delvey?

07:52.513 --> 07:55.391
It's impossible to tell.
She says it's her mother's maiden name.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.392
I checked. No dice.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.603
This chick is worth
the price of admission.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.355
'13, Ms. Delvey, a magazine intern,

08:01.439 --> 08:06.360
travels from France to the US
for a vacation in Montauk with coworkers.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.320
She must have dug it

08:07.403 --> 08:10.072
because she does not
go home to Paris with everyone else.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.658
On August 13th, Anna arrives in Manhattan.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.369
Know what else arrived
in Manhattan around that time?

08:15.453 --> 08:17.121
Ebola. Coincidence? No.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.456
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

08:18.539 --> 08:22.043
She met Val a couple of days later.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.920
He deleted all his photos of her,

08:24.003 --> 08:26.339
but if you look at his feed next to hers…

08:26.422 --> 08:28.382
Acme Bar, Acme Bar. They line up.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.552
People these days,
living every minute online.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.596
Privacy's over
but I'm just getting started.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.098
You're gonna like this.
Chase's Insta account.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.268
August 26th,
Chase posts a photo of a chess set.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.770
- Nice.
- What?

08:40.853 --> 08:46.442
A chess set was the very first thing
Anna ever posted to her account.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.486
Oh, that's a little stalker-y.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.988
Or romantic. And a week later…

09:02.333 --> 09:04.835
Ah, we got busy!

09:04.919 --> 09:06.546
From that moment on,

09:06.629 --> 09:10.424
Chase and Anna's feeds
are almost perfectly synced.

09:10.508 --> 09:14.804
San Francisco. Berlin. Paris.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.473
A globe-trotting whirlwind romance.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.017
Los Angeles.
Chase's 33rd birthday.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.394
#Cakeformybaby.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.604
Okay, that's adorable.

09:23.688 --> 09:27.817
He was the hot new futurist "it" boy
with the next big click thingy.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.068
<i>They were everywhere.</i>

09:31.946 --> 09:35.199
<i>And wherever they were became somewhere.</i>

09:36.576 --> 09:39.078
<i>For a while,</i>
<i>Anna and Chase lived in hotels.</i>

09:39.161 --> 09:43.082
<i>Like, who does that?</i>
<i>Live in hotels? Like Eloise.</i>

09:43.165 --> 09:47.545
<i>Anna did. And Chase lived with her,</i>
<i>in hotels all over the world.</i>

09:47.628 --> 09:50.339
<i>Jet-setting,</i>
<i>promoting his app, living the life.</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:51.924
Who paid for all that?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.010
Oh, always Chase.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.637
Chase had new money
coming into the business,

09:56.721 --> 10:00.474
and Anna wasn't supposed to get her
trust money until 25, so always Chase.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.519
Until that summer
they stayed with me, and…

10:03.603 --> 10:04.854
Well, stayed with Nora.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.897
- Because I stay with Nora, so…
- Nora?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.317
Nora. My best friend.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.028
<i>She's currently bringing back the kaftan.</i>

10:13.946 --> 10:16.657
Wait, you're talking about Nora Radford?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.703
As in, the Nora Radford?

10:25.374 --> 10:28.919
Yes. I know what you're thinking.
But Nora wants me to stay with her.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.881
<i>Fashion pays in style, not in hundreds.</i>

10:33.132 --> 10:35.134
<i>Nora's incredibly fun. She's fucking rich.</i>

10:35.217 --> 10:39.639
<i>And besides, she loves me more</i>
<i>than my bitch mother ever did.</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:46.354
- Chase and Anna?
- Right.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.148
Uh, they stayed at Nora's and it worked.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.568
<i>Anna and I had our time together.</i>

10:55.780 --> 10:58.199
<i>And Chase and Anna had theirs.</i>

11:14.090 --> 11:17.176
Late night screwing on Grindr?
Slut!

11:17.259 --> 11:19.136
Don't you dare try to shame me.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.680
- You still have orgasm face.
- Stop.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.474
I like him.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.935
Oh, please don't tell me he's "the one."

11:26.018 --> 11:27.561
- Didn't he grow up in Ohio?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.480
You realize he's basically a farmer?

11:29.563 --> 11:30.940
He's normal.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.483
I like that about him.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.693
You sure Farmer Ted
isn't after your trust fund?

11:34.777 --> 11:38.072
Chase is one of
the only people I've ever met

11:38.155 --> 11:40.741
who doesn't seem
interested in me for my money.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.035
He never lets me pay for anything.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.996
He's self-made.
That's something to admire.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.457
Please. I'm self-made.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.459
Which is why I admire you so much.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.974
<i>So what happened with them?</i>
<i>With Val and Anna?</i>

12:05.057 --> 12:07.435
And all this globe-trotting.
Why choose New York,

12:07.518 --> 12:10.146
hardest of any of these places,
to start a business?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.149
Well, it is New York.
If you can make it here, and all that.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.775
Or she came here for Chase.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.319
What's his take?
If you want to know her deal ask her old--

12:17.403 --> 12:18.737
No. He's out.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.324
I can't find him.
His Insta goes dark in 2016.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.409
What about her?

12:23.492 --> 12:26.120
September 2014, Ibiza.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.747
Anna, Chase
and this very attractive person.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.542
Is that who I think it is?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.175
Talia Mallay.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.346
Anna Delvey spent time with Talia Mallay.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.848
Okay, and?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.433
And Talia's agreed to speak with me

12:47.516 --> 12:49.727
so I need you to authorize
travel to the Hamptons.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.313
I'm not paying
for your baby-moon in the Hamptons.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.940
It's a rental car
and one night in a chain motel.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.484
Can't you just call her?

12:56.567 --> 12:59.403
Call her?

12:59.528 --> 13:01.989
Yeah, what is it
that you can't get by calling her?

13:04.575 --> 13:07.203
- I don't think I'm asking for a lot here.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.705
It took tons of connections and convincing

13:09.788 --> 13:12.917
to get Talia Mallay
to agree to meet with me.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.128
To make time in her busy schedule
running a global empire

13:16.212 --> 13:18.797
to explain
why someone running a global empire

13:18.881 --> 13:20.591
would be friends with someone like Anna.

13:20.674 --> 13:24.470
I just need a little bit of help from you,
my editor, in getting there.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.096
You know I'm trying to help you.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.141
You didn't give me the two weeks,
Landon gave me the two weeks--

13:29.225 --> 13:31.685
I gave you the Wall Street story.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.187
I offered you redemption.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.772
A big story that would clear the air,

13:34.855 --> 13:37.983
put some distance between
you and the Donovan Lamb debacle.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.903
That's the best I can do.
I don't know what else you want from me.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.281
I want you to not make me beg
to get one tiny expense approved!

13:49.828 --> 13:50.704
Okay.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.751
If this fake socialite
is the hill you want to die on, so be it.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.568
- Neff.
- Rachel.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.991
So? What?

14:27.908 --> 14:30.995
I went to court. Anna's not taking a plea.

14:31.078 --> 14:34.748
She's going to trial, which means
she'll be in Rikers for, like, months.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.418
Uh-huh.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.504
I thought we should
work out some kind of schedule

14:40.588 --> 14:43.215
so she has one of us
visiting her at least once a week.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.592
- What?
- I went online.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.678
There's a list of stuff we can
bring inmates. Magazines and stuff.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.555
Are you… Wait…

14:50.764 --> 14:52.016
You're kidding, right?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.184
Why would I be kidding?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.312
It's prison. Our friend is in prison.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.981
We can't just leave her in there.
She needs people.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.774
I'm not visiting Anna in prison.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.739
I'm not required
to visit that person in prison.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.283
- That person? She was your best friend.
- Oh.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.369
Her dad cuts her off
and now she can't pay your way,

15:12.453 --> 15:14.872
fund your social life
and clothes, so you drop her?

15:14.955 --> 15:17.041
Anna did not ever pay my way.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.710
Anna paid for those shoes and that jacket.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.296
I was there
when she bought those earrings.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.549
The sweater. And I know that bag!
She paid for everything you have on.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.260
First National Bank of Delvey
is closed and you dump her.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.597
- You're a user.
- If anyone is the user, it's you.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.726
I mean, we were friends, you…
You were her paid bitch.

15:35.809 --> 15:36.810
Okay, what?

15:36.894 --> 15:40.272
I mean, yeah, she may
have bought some of my clothes, but you?

15:40.356 --> 15:41.690
I mean, you let her buy you!

15:41.774 --> 15:43.400
She bought your time, she bought your--

15:43.484 --> 15:46.320
Say someone bought me again.
Say it now. Come on. Try me.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.616
Step up here and discuss
the purchase of this Black woman

15:50.699 --> 15:53.786
because I am dying to correct your face!

15:56.580 --> 15:57.706
Come on!

15:58.832 --> 16:00.542
Yeah, you'd better run!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.262
What do we have on Talia Mallay?

16:12.346 --> 16:14.640
- "We"? What do we…
- You deposed her already?

16:14.723 --> 16:15.849
Why are you here?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.893
We should be working together.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.478
We could be working together.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.604
And yet we are not.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.149
I'm not sure what you did to convince
my client to give you an exclusive,

16:24.233 --> 16:25.985
but it does not involve my defense.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.487
Look, if you share what you have on Talia,

16:28.570 --> 16:31.281
I can tag in
and follow up when I meet with her.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.576
- Round out your defense.
- We are not… There is no "we."

16:35.494 --> 16:36.870
So you haven't deposed her?

16:37.871 --> 16:39.748
Well, what does
the prosecution have from her?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.212
Can you color it at least? Ball-park it?

16:45.295 --> 16:47.381
The more ammunition we have going into--

16:47.464 --> 16:51.427
Vivian Kent, get out.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.430
Out.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.400
What do we have
on Talia Mallay?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.694
Nothing, I think. I can check again.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.988
Fine, you check that box,
I'll check the rest.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.782
- The rest?
- You're telling me this is it?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.452
All the DA's office sent over?

17:16.535 --> 17:20.581
Every bit of discovery they have
to share fits in one fucking box?

17:39.016 --> 17:41.727
There's a sculpture
of a tree by an actual tree.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.646
These houses are $30 million.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.567
Who has $30 million to spend on a house?

17:49.985 --> 17:51.570
Not even a first house, a second house.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.364
Women with billion-dollar
lifestyle brands, apparently.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.575
All the houses in my entire hometown

17:56.658 --> 17:59.787
put together wouldn't be worth
even ten million dollars.

17:59.870 --> 18:00.746
Yeah.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.915
Look at that.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.875
- What?
- That house is ridiculous!

18:04.958 --> 18:06.752
No one should live in a house that large.

18:06.835 --> 18:07.836
Honey…

18:17.805 --> 18:18.639
Breathe.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.775
I'll pick you up in… How's an hour sound?

18:29.858 --> 18:32.694
I'm at the whim of a mogul.
How about I call you when I'm--

18:32.778 --> 18:34.029
Welcome!

18:35.239 --> 18:36.073
Welcome!

18:37.950 --> 18:39.034
Hi.

18:45.916 --> 18:46.834
Yeah.

18:47.960 --> 18:48.877
Okay.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.087
Please follow me.

18:58.679 --> 19:02.808
Oh. Uh… I didn't realize
you were having company.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.310
There's always a few people around.
I love to entertain.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.228
Hmm.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.355
But how rude of me not to tell you.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.357
You know, I have a new beachwear line.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.026
One of the kaftans
would look stunning on you.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.945
No, thank you, I'm fine.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.781
It's no problem to bring out
some options for you to choose from.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.492
I always like to make sure
my guests are comfortable.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.660
I'm comfortable.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.050
That smells amazing.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.136
See? Stunning.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.182
You want to hear something embarrassing?

19:43.265 --> 19:47.477
The first time I ever
even turned on an oven, I was 25.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.105
- Come on, really?
- I never made anything.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.400
I mean, cocktails. I was mixing martinis
for my parents and their friends

19:53.483 --> 19:54.943
when I was ten, but the kitchen?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.236
It was fully staffed.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.614
Every time you wanted to do anything,

19:58.697 --> 20:00.282
get a glass of milk, anything,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.784
there was always
someone there to do it for you.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.872
I had to ask my first boyfriend
to teach me how to fry an egg.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.999
And you're embarrassed by this?

20:09.666 --> 20:12.336
It's embarrassing not to know
how to take care of yourself.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.297
To not be able to take care
of the people you love.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.465
I know.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.258
Poor little rich girl.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.678
What an asshole!
Go cry into your money.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.138
No. Not at all.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.099
I used to be embarrassed
about that too. The money.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.769
So I made my own.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.356
Tell me…

20:33.857 --> 20:34.900
if this is ready.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.198
Oh, my God. Delicious.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.327
So, Anna Delvey.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.788
Is she running Rikers yet?

20:48.455 --> 20:49.748
What makes you think she could?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.500
I put nothing past Anna.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.584
Were you two close?

20:52.668 --> 20:55.712
We vacationed together once.
Dined out a few times.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.131
What was the connection,
if you don't mind me asking?

20:59.007 --> 21:01.551
I appreciate a woman
who doesn't try to impress.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.762
Who isn't afraid.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.305
Who doesn't give a fuck?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.184
And she had great taste in art.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.187
Thank you.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.581
Stunning, isn't it?

21:35.377 --> 21:37.254
I'm bidding on it, so…

21:37.337 --> 21:40.590
fake your approval like the rest
of these phonies, if you don't mind.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.302
The only thing worth a dime in here

21:43.385 --> 21:44.386
is her.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.525
- Cindy Sherman?

21:58.608 --> 22:01.361
Among the first
of her untitled film stills.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.030
Mmm. Yeah.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.990
Cindy's great, but over half a million

22:05.073 --> 22:07.492
for just another
eight-by-ten of her playing dress-up?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.373
Before this series,

22:13.457 --> 22:17.794
Sherman was just another
photographer hiding behind the lens.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.923
Observing. Choosing subjects
based on what others might like.

22:23.091 --> 22:26.136
Then one day she steps into her own frame.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.180
Considers herself to be worthy.

22:28.263 --> 22:33.560
Rather than being forced into a role
in the male-dominated art world,

22:33.643 --> 22:36.438
she takes a leading role in her work.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.819
And it changes the world.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.697
This is not dress-up.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.699
This is bravery.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.327
This is a moment in art.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.207
You must be one of Damian's gallerinas.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.250
You think I work here?

22:57.334 --> 22:58.585
I don't work.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.463
What's wrong with working?

23:02.547 --> 23:06.259
How else will you ever be able
to afford to give Cindy here a good home?

23:06.343 --> 23:10.472
My father buys whatever I tell him to.
And someday it will all go to me.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.310
Earning it beats inheriting it.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.230
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

23:19.189 --> 23:22.651
The person considering
buying that, uh, thing?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.528
Instead of this?

23:26.196 --> 23:27.030
Hmm.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.705
I bought it, of course.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.791
Oh, of course.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.210
I liked her.

23:41.378 --> 23:44.256
So she became part of my circle.
For a while.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.758
Until she showed up in Ibiza.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.009
Ibitha?

23:48.969 --> 23:50.720
Oh, Ibiza. Right.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.474
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.726
I was there with some friends

23:56.810 --> 23:59.855
and she and Chase had texted
to let us know they were in town,

23:59.938 --> 24:01.898
except it was strange right off the bat.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.032
Wait, stop. What the fuck is that boat?

24:12.075 --> 24:13.034
Whose feed is that?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.911
That's Talia's. She's in Ibiza.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.913
That can't be her boat.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.041
It's a yacht, and it's not.
It's this guy's.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.752
Fuck, Henrick Knight?
That dude's huge in tech.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.796
I saw him speak
at the Silicon Alley thing.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.549
I need him to invest in Wake.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.135
His endorsement could open
the floodgates for investment.

24:30.218 --> 24:35.140
Hmm. Stanford, tennis player,
invested in biotech.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.433
Net worth two billion.

24:36.516 --> 24:37.475
Text Talia.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.645
- Text her what?
- Tell her we're in Ibiza.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.231
- But we're in Chelsea.
- Just do it. Tell her we're there.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.191
What…

24:44.941 --> 24:46.651
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.237
Uh…

24:56.703 --> 24:58.914
She's… she's answering.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.125
- What did she say?
- Uh… she invited us for dinner.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.752
Fuck! Uh, what should I tell her?

25:03.835 --> 25:07.005
Tell her we're busy tonight,
we'll come by tomorrow.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.590
- Chase…
- Tell her.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.634
What? Fuck, okay, okay.

25:14.804 --> 25:15.847
Is she answering?

25:15.931 --> 25:16.932
Hold on.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.646
Dinner tomorrow?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.484
We'd better book tickets.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.402
Oh, no, I'm… I'm not.

25:29.486 --> 25:33.198
My father is not happy
with me at the moment, so…

25:33.865 --> 25:35.075
It's cool, I got it.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.870
Well, I'm off.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.539
Think of me in Paris
working four runway shows

25:41.623 --> 25:45.418
in three days like a normal
while you two lounge here in my life.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.254
We're going to Ibiza.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.172
- Mmm. I loathe you.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.343
Can we even get there by dinner?

26:28.545 --> 26:30.797
So crazy,
I can't believe we're both here!

26:30.880 --> 26:33.133
I know! What are the odds?

26:33.216 --> 26:35.760
- Hey, man.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.388
Incredible yacht.
What's her max? 17 knots?

26:38.471 --> 26:39.973
On open sea she'll do 20.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.725
Come on, I'll show you round.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.651
Bryce. Steve.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.028
Hi.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.530
So I've definitely seen you
at Soho House, right?

26:55.613 --> 26:57.824
No, I… I don't go there.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.284
Oh, did they reject you?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.120
I mean, Steve can totally hook you up.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.496
Yeah.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.957
I'd rather hang out at a McDonalds

27:06.041 --> 27:08.668
or maybe start my own club
where I reject their members.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.879
You should.
They let way too many people in.

27:10.962 --> 27:11.921
It's so bro-y now.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.549
Oh. Wait, I love your dress.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.718
I know! It's perfection.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.429
Thank you! I got it in town.

27:19.512 --> 27:23.433
- Uh, I'll bring you by there. My treat.
- Oh, you really don't have to do that.

27:23.516 --> 27:24.768
Yeah, not for me anyway.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.686
Steve, like, gets off on buying me shit.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.937
Don't you, Steve?

27:28.021 --> 27:30.106
Well, I'd argue,
but even if I win,

27:30.190 --> 27:34.361
I lose, so yeah,
I get off on buying her shit.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.529
No, please, I'm happy to.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.157
It's the least I can do
in return for the hospitality.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.826
Well, <i>salud.</i>

27:41.910 --> 27:42.786
<i>- Salud.</i>
<i>- Salud.</i>

27:49.918 --> 27:52.545
- Catherine!
- Did we have a meeting scheduled?

27:52.629 --> 27:55.048
No meeting. I was just
wondering if we're playing dirty.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.134
Because I wasn't planning on it,
but here you are, playing dirty,

27:58.218 --> 28:00.428
so I thought I'd warn you,
this ends badly for you.

28:00.512 --> 28:04.349
Todd, in order to feel threatened,
I have to know what you're talking about.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.434
Discovery?
You sent over a shoebox.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.395
- Lane?
- It wasn't a shoebox.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.354
It wasn't a shoebox.

28:09.437 --> 28:12.482
I see, so I should plan on
showing up to trial with ten empty boxes

28:12.565 --> 28:15.402
for all the evidence that
you'll have just magically discovered?

28:15.485 --> 28:16.986
That's dirty!

28:17.070 --> 28:20.824
Todd, two tips for you.
One, I do not play dirty. Ever.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.535
Two, you will never know the law
better than I know the law.

28:23.618 --> 28:25.412
- Oh.
- That is literally impossible.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.956
And the law requires me
to process discovery disclosure

28:28.039 --> 28:30.333
to the defense
in the most thorough manner possible.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.336
That is what I have done.
And what I will continue to do.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.130
<i>Ad infinitum.</i> In perpetuity.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.928
I want every piece of evidence
you have by the end of this week.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.556
Are you asking me
to waive my ethical responsibility

28:44.639 --> 28:46.516
to act with due diligence in the execution

28:46.599 --> 28:49.018
of my prosecutorial
professional responsibilities?

28:49.102 --> 28:50.854
Everything, Catherine.

28:50.937 --> 28:51.771
Everything.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.983
- You're sure?
- End of the week!

29:11.916 --> 29:14.836
Sorry I'm late.
I needed to do some extra laps.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.421
For me, Neff?

29:16.504 --> 29:17.630
Thanks, love.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.551
So is this about visiting Anna?

29:22.260 --> 29:23.553
You talked to Rachel?

29:23.636 --> 29:25.889
She called. Crying.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.432
Did you try to beat her up?

29:27.515 --> 29:29.184
Kacy. It's Rachel.

29:29.267 --> 29:32.854
Don't. She's a sweetie.

29:32.937 --> 29:33.980
She won't visit Anna.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.442
You know Anna.
She is not ready for the real world.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.402
She is going to
get upset about the service

29:39.486 --> 29:42.489
or be herself to the wrong chick
and end up with a beatdown.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.157
We cannot leave her alone in there.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.868
She needs to look forward
to something. And Rachel…

29:48.286 --> 29:50.371
She acts like
she barely knew Anna all of a sudden.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.166
Like Anna is some stranger.
As if she's new to the situation.

29:53.249 --> 29:57.378
She literally is walking
in Anna's shoes as we speak.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.713
Red bottoms. Spring collection.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.798
I wish I had hit her.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.549
- My fist in Becky's face…
- Okay. Stop.

30:08.264 --> 30:09.182
Good.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.770
Neff, Rachel
is not visiting Anna in prison.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.063
She has her reasons.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.232
But I think it's wonderful that you are.

30:18.274 --> 30:19.108
Okay.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.694
So do you want to do visits
every other week with me?

30:21.778 --> 30:24.489
- Or twice a week, or…
- Baby.

30:25.448 --> 30:28.201
I'm setting some boundaries
where Anna is concerned.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.871
I will also
not be going to Rikers to see her.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.290
But I'll always be here for you.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.043
Oh.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.420
- Neff?
- I don't understand.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.882
How do you just turn your back on someone?

30:43.550 --> 30:44.676
Neff.

30:44.759 --> 30:48.012
The person in prison is not Anna Delvey.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.681
Not the person we knew.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.475
Anna Delvey doesn't exist.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.644
That person in Rikers is somebody else.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.397
Somebody who was pretending
to be Anna Delvey.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.566
We don't know her.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.985
- You don't know anything about her.
- She's Anna.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.987
She may be your friend, Anna.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.864
Or she may be a total stranger.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.116
Do you want to go down there,
walk into that prison

31:08.199 --> 31:11.494
and find out the person you thought
was one of your closest friends

31:11.578 --> 31:13.413
was just a made-up character?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.301
<i>Vash…</i> What's that?

31:26.384 --> 31:28.052
Anna?

31:28.136 --> 31:30.763
What? I… I have no idea.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.517
Sorry, I thought I caught
a little Ruskie in your accent.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.102
Oh.

31:37.979 --> 31:38.897
To your health.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.899
I did a year in Moscow during college.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.692
The only thing I remember is the toasts.

31:44.110 --> 31:44.986
For you.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.072
- For you, my dear.
- Cheers!

31:48.156 --> 31:49.657
- A little sloppy.
- Cheers.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.953
- We're here.
- We made it.

31:54.954 --> 31:55.788
Cheers.

32:10.845 --> 32:14.182
I don't know how you do it, Talia.
Working sucks.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.267
I just want to follow the party year-round

32:16.351 --> 32:18.811
while those bozos
figure out a way to pay for it.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.273
You know what I mean, Anna.

32:24.817 --> 32:25.985
So where's next?

32:26.069 --> 32:27.654
Oh, well, Stevie thinks…

32:27.737 --> 32:29.238
Data is the new time.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.115
Yes, but it's dream data.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.827
Subjective, and honestly it sounds
about as valuable as, well, dreams,

32:34.911 --> 32:36.746
which, I mean,
what's a bigger waste of time

32:36.829 --> 32:38.790
than listening to someone
tell you their dreams?

32:38.873 --> 32:40.291
Totally. The worst.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.584
That's a small part of it.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.712
…Miami in two weeks,
and who do you think wins that argument?

32:44.796 --> 32:46.506
We're harvesting massive…

32:46.589 --> 32:49.884
God, Chase is working Hen
so hard on this app of his.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.135
He's so shameless.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.804
…fantasies and the value…

32:52.887 --> 32:55.306
He's just really passionate about it.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.101
Sure, and that's great and all,
but we're on vacation.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.310
He needs to chill.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.105
Hen!

33:02.188 --> 33:03.398
Come on, let's dance!

33:03.481 --> 33:06.234
- Just to close the thought--
- Chase, enough with the shop talk.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.487
Uh, Hen, hold on.

33:09.570 --> 33:12.156
Quick question. How old are you? Late 50s?

33:13.032 --> 33:14.617
About that, yeah. Why?

33:15.284 --> 33:19.038
Well, I'm just curious
what the age is when you draw the line.

33:19.122 --> 33:22.583
I mean, a lot of what you just said,
and your whole attitude,

33:22.667 --> 33:25.128
my father said the same things
to me back in high school

33:25.211 --> 33:27.255
when I told him to invest in Facebook.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.340
"Well, I have a telephone."

33:29.424 --> 33:31.592
"Why wouldn't I just call my friends?"

33:31.676 --> 33:33.761
But really what he meant was,

33:33.845 --> 33:37.557
"I'm smarter than you, little girl,
and it's impossible that I'm not right."

33:38.224 --> 33:40.935
Add a dash of misogyny
to that attitude and boom,

33:41.019 --> 33:43.771
you too can lose
$100 million, just like that.

33:43.855 --> 33:47.275
Which isn't a problem for Hen.
Obviously. He's doing just fine.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.402
Well, so was my father.

33:49.485 --> 33:51.279
The money is not the point.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.322
The question's bigger than that.

33:53.406 --> 33:57.452
You know, I wonder.
Is it that the closer you are to death

33:57.535 --> 33:59.620
the more sure you need to be about life?

33:59.704 --> 34:02.665
About the stuff you know,
or you think you know?

34:03.541 --> 34:07.587
Because
it can be scary to get old.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.384
Is it?

34:17.388 --> 34:20.224
This convo is really bumming me out.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.893
Yeah. Let's all just--

34:21.976 --> 34:24.479
What, no! Because I can relate.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.773
I'm scared about what to do with my life.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.108
So I avoid the question.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.568
Try to outrun it.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.153
But it haunts me.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.113
Does death haunt you?

34:34.197 --> 34:35.531
Anna, stop.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.784
- You are a guest, my guest--
- It's fine.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.077
I can handle it.

34:41.287 --> 34:42.747
Of course you can.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.333
And he wants to answer.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.959
Look at him.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.507
I think about death
more these days, sure. So what?

34:54.175 --> 34:56.010
Do you ever dream about it?

34:57.720 --> 35:03.101
Do you think other people your age
dream about death?

35:04.519 --> 35:05.436
The fear.

35:07.105 --> 35:07.939
Yeah.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.358
They do.

35:10.441 --> 35:14.612
If I'm Big Pharma,
wouldn't it be valuable to know this?

35:14.695 --> 35:16.322
So I can sell you Xanax or whatever?

35:23.746 --> 35:24.747
You're good.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.126
She's good!

35:28.209 --> 35:30.211
You say you're looking for a job?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.963
Me?

35:32.046 --> 35:35.299
No, no. I made a pledge
not to work for others.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.384
Ah.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.179
You can make a pledge too. If you like.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.692
Here's the Kickstarter page for Wake.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.279
I think you get a T-shirt.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.531
If he reaches his goal, or something.

36:09.750 --> 36:10.877
How's 100K?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.713
Very generous. Thank you.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.966
Great, now we dance.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.807
Oh.

36:27.977 --> 36:29.312
Amazing.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.772
And you, do you know how lucky you are?

36:31.856 --> 36:33.107
She's incredible.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.442
Be my partner.

36:35.651 --> 36:38.404
Head of PR. Or funding. Or both.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.823
I'll think about it.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.160
You should be working for her, dude.

36:54.837 --> 36:57.798
<i>Her energy was just… </i>

36:57.882 --> 36:59.926
<i>It was incredible to watch her blossom.</i>

37:01.302 --> 37:02.970
<i>She blew us all away.</i>

37:04.055 --> 37:07.391
<i>- And she was mad about Chase.</i>
- You know what happens if you do this?

37:07.475 --> 37:08.893
- What?
- I…

37:12.271 --> 37:16.609
<i>And he was glued to her</i>
<i>every second of the day.</i>

37:22.031 --> 37:23.699
- <i>Talia, hi!</i>

37:23.783 --> 37:26.661
<i>And about a week later,</i>
<i>I got this strange call from Hen.</i>

37:26.744 --> 37:27.703
Where are you?

37:27.787 --> 37:29.247
We're here, in Ibiza.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.581
On the boat?

37:31.249 --> 37:32.667
Yeah, we miss you!

37:32.750 --> 37:33.918
<i>Anna, what the fuck?</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:36.254
<i>We all left.</i>

37:36.337 --> 37:40.466
Hen left five days ago and just got a call
from his crew saying you were still there.

37:40.549 --> 37:42.343
<i>And I told him that was impossible</i>

37:42.426 --> 37:45.513
because who would just
stay on someone else's boat

37:45.596 --> 37:47.390
that was a guest of a guest?

37:47.473 --> 37:49.809
<i>Ordering the crew around</i>
<i>as if they were your own--</i>

37:49.892 --> 37:50.935
Talia, Talia, calm down.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.688
The boat's here, so we just
thought we'd stay for a few days.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.481
Anna, get off the boat.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.818
<i>I can't believe I have to explain</i>
<i>to you how fucked up this is,</i>

37:58.901 --> 38:01.696
and how bad it makes me look
that the people I invited--

38:01.779 --> 38:04.782
Sorry, we'll leave. It's all fine.

38:04.865 --> 38:05.825
How are you?

38:06.409 --> 38:07.702
How am I?

38:09.120 --> 38:09.996
Fuck!

38:11.038 --> 38:13.416
Get the fuck off the boat!

38:16.127 --> 38:17.461
Wait, they stayed?

38:17.545 --> 38:21.382
We had all gotten off together
and said goodbye.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.509
- Who does that?
- How did they even get back on?

38:23.592 --> 38:24.552
No idea.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.636
But you know,

38:25.720 --> 38:30.099
the cost alone for keeping the captain
and crew on a yacht for an extra week is…

38:32.310 --> 38:35.021
It's about the same as if they'd
pushed Hen's Tesla off the dock.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.023
That's how much boat time they stole.

38:37.106 --> 38:40.901
Mmm. Do you think because Anna
grew up so entitled that she--

38:40.985 --> 38:42.486
Anna, no.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.532
Anna knows better.
This couldn't have been Anna's idea.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.660
Chase was on the make,
taking whatever he could get.

38:49.744 --> 38:53.456
But why would Anna
let him do that, or go along with that?

38:53.539 --> 38:56.083
She was in love and stupid.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.962
Did she ever apologize?

39:01.297 --> 39:02.423
We never spoke again.

39:04.508 --> 39:07.511
And that's the end
of our story, I'm afraid.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.481
God, I'm so sorry. It's late, isn't it?

39:19.440 --> 39:20.649
We should be going.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.526
I… Let me just call my husband and--

39:22.610 --> 39:24.278
You guys should stay.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.656
It's too late to drive back.
There's plenty of room here.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.574
Thank you, no.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.451
- We have a motel, we're all set.
- Motel?

39:32.703 --> 39:34.997
Nonsense. There's a guest cottage.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.916
Anna stayed there a few times.

39:36.999 --> 39:42.046
I put the Sherman in there, actually.
You could soak up the vibe or whatever.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.372
- Jack, what are you--
- Do you feel that?

40:16.455 --> 40:17.915
I feel you are insane.

40:17.998 --> 40:21.836
Stop walking, stop talking,
just… do you feel that?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.088
What is that?

40:25.297 --> 40:26.257
The stone, it's--

40:26.340 --> 40:28.592
Ninety-seven degrees.

40:28.676 --> 40:33.514
Heated floors, literally equalized
to our body temperature.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.224
Oh.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.311
No offense, but I want to fuck this floor.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.438
It gets better.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.858
Inhale.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.360
- What is that?
- Sage.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.947
This whole freaking compound
must be infused with it.

40:50.030 --> 40:53.367
And yet, I can't find sage anywhere.
And I've looked.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.828
Maybe it's not sage we're smelling,
maybe it's money.

40:57.496 --> 40:58.998
Don't bother with that cheap thing.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.297
Hmm?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.092
First we are going to use
every product in this cabinet,

41:10.176 --> 41:12.011
and then we are going to have so much sex.

41:12.094 --> 41:12.928
Hell yeah.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.893
I could swim home.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.396
- That's how well I slept.
- Mmm.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.774
These sheets are
made of kittens or something.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.030
I can't move. I won't move.

41:37.036 --> 41:39.497
How many rooms like this
do you think Anna's been in?

41:41.624 --> 41:43.876
She had a good life.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.337
If only you could afford me.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.716
You saw them in Paris
right after they left Ibiza, right?

42:32.800 --> 42:35.261
Okay, Ibiza.
What exactly went down in Ibiza?

42:35.344 --> 42:37.555
Do you know? Did Talia tell you?

42:37.638 --> 42:39.723
Look at you, all intrigued.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.600
Why do you care what happened in Ibiza?

42:41.684 --> 42:45.479
All I know is that when I met up with them
in Paris everything was different.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.689
It was Fashion Week.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.399
I was styling three shows

42:48.482 --> 42:51.610
and we were holed up
in the suite at the Hotel Gulacsy.

42:51.694 --> 42:55.823
I was working hard,
they were partying hard,

42:55.906 --> 42:58.784
and the seams
were really starting to show.

43:03.539 --> 43:04.832
Too much personality up there.

43:04.915 --> 43:07.167
- Never pull focus from the fabric.
- Sorry, Val.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.629
Talia saw my potential,
and you totally killed that connection.

43:10.713 --> 43:13.757
I'm offering you in
on the ground floor of Wake. Angel level.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.134
And I don't want it!

43:15.217 --> 43:17.094
Do you have any idea what that's worth?

43:17.177 --> 43:21.640
A percentage of nothing
is still nothing, you moron.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.267
You just want my money.

43:23.350 --> 43:25.519
Your money?
What money? I pay for everything.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.063
And it doesn't matter
because I want to do my own thing.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.607
What? What thing?

43:29.690 --> 43:32.026
I don't know yet! I don't know. I…

43:32.109 --> 43:34.028
Something big. Something that's mine.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.530
- That's monumental.
- Wake is going to be fucking huge.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.240
No, you're not listening.

43:38.324 --> 43:41.910
Try getting outside
of yourself for one fucking second.

43:41.994 --> 43:44.622
Try being less
of a psycho for one fucking second!

43:44.705 --> 43:46.540
Okay! Enough, Chase. Cool it.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.375
Walk away, Val.

43:48.459 --> 43:51.378
Like you did on the VIP tickets
that I busted my ass to get you?

43:51.462 --> 43:53.088
It's clothes on stick people.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.632
Who gives a fuck?

43:59.261 --> 44:00.220
You know what?

44:01.347 --> 44:02.389
She's all yours.

44:03.974 --> 44:04.850
I'm out.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.561
Chase!

44:07.645 --> 44:09.146
Chase, seriously?

44:09.980 --> 44:12.024
Seriously? What? He's a child.

44:12.107 --> 44:14.777
He… he's a fucking toddler. I swear!

44:14.860 --> 44:16.528
Let's find some fucking champagne

44:16.612 --> 44:19.573
and watch some movies
and hate all men but me.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.491
Yeah.

44:37.883 --> 44:39.218
Hey, where are you?

44:39.301 --> 44:41.387
- Are you with Anna?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:41.470 --> 44:42.471
I need a favor.

44:42.554 --> 44:43.389
What?

44:43.472 --> 44:45.474
<i>I need you to check Anna's passport.</i>

44:46.558 --> 44:47.810
Why? Check it for what?

44:47.893 --> 44:50.145
Just check it.
Look at it for me, will you?

44:50.229 --> 44:52.439
I'm not checking her passport.
That is so creepy.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.525
I think she's lying to me.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.568
<i>- I know she's lying to me.</i>
- About what?

45:00.697 --> 45:03.033
- I'm hanging up.
- About her money, for one thing.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.368
Chase, seriously.

45:04.451 --> 45:07.287
The girl's a walking ATM.
She's practically royalty.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.206
Just check. It'll only take a second.

45:09.289 --> 45:11.083
- No.
- What's the big deal?

45:11.166 --> 45:13.127
If it's not a big deal
then check yourself.

45:14.294 --> 45:16.588
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Are you high? You sound high.</i>

45:18.424 --> 45:20.426
Just come over here
and talk to your girlfriend.

45:20.509 --> 45:21.427
Never mind.

45:25.055 --> 45:27.182
Did you tell Anna? Ask her about her name?

45:27.266 --> 45:28.434
I had no reason to.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.978
The questionable behavior
was all Chase at this point.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.856
At this point?
So there's a point where that shifted?

45:38.068 --> 45:41.488
- Come on, one night cap. Loser.
- Lush. No. Uh-uh.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.614
Ms. Delvey.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.908
Ms. Delvey,
we haven't received the transfer.

45:44.992 --> 45:47.411
We called the bank.
They haven't been given any instructions.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.872
I'm afraid I have
to ask you for another credit card.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.665
- Not now.
- She gave you a card.

45:51.748 --> 45:53.125
- Didn't you?
- I did!

45:53.208 --> 45:54.793
- Ms. Delvey.
- You have all my cards.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.628
- Run them again!
- I've run them already.

45:56.712 --> 45:59.047
Then there must be
a problem with the system.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.467
- I need another card or cash.
- Well, run them.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.052
Don't you want to be paid?

46:04.136 --> 46:07.264
My father will be very unhappy
that I was treated this way.

46:07.347 --> 46:09.683
You could call your father
and get a working card.

46:09.766 --> 46:13.187
Are you siding with this little
power-hungry middle manager?

46:13.270 --> 46:15.689
- Insulting me won't help.
- I need my pills and to lie down.

46:15.772 --> 46:17.900
Well, my father will wire
the money as soon--

46:17.983 --> 46:20.903
It's the middle of the night.
There are no banks open to wire it.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.488
In the morning then. Come on.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.573
Oh.

46:24.656 --> 46:26.492
My God. We can't even… This is absurd.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.160
I just need the pills from my bag.

46:28.243 --> 46:31.163
We're holding your possessions
until payment is received.

46:31.246 --> 46:34.791
You have several forms of payment.
This is your problem, not ours!

46:37.628 --> 46:40.172
Fuck this. I'm gonna call Chase
and he'll cover it.

46:40.255 --> 46:41.590
No. I will fix this.

46:41.673 --> 46:43.133
- How?
- Well, just run them again.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.385
Anna! No, I need my pills.
I need to sleep.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.012
I have a big day at work tomorrow.

46:47.095 --> 46:50.307
- Let me call Chase.
- No, you will not call him. I'll fix this.

46:50.390 --> 46:53.143
- Fine, I'll call Nora.
- Wait, no, do not call Nora.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.938
- It's embarrassing.
- It's beyond that. We'll be homeless.

46:56.021 --> 46:56.939
Val! No!

46:57.022 --> 47:00.692
Okay, this is absurd. Let us into a room.
This is becoming a medical emergency.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.653
There is a very simple solution to this.

47:02.736 --> 47:05.489
I need a working credit card.

47:21.505 --> 47:22.464
Ms. Delvey.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.316
Anna?

47:42.526 --> 47:43.610
Val, I'm…

47:44.861 --> 47:46.905
I'm… I'm sorry. I've…

47:47.864 --> 47:49.241
My father…

47:51.034 --> 47:54.580
I'm… I'm so… I'm so alone.

47:55.998 --> 48:01.753
He cut… he cut me off.
He… he cuts… He cuts me off. I…

48:02.379 --> 48:03.213
I…

48:04.047 --> 48:05.215
I'll pay.

48:06.508 --> 48:10.470
I'll… I'll pay. I'll… I'll pay.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.431
I just… I just need to…

48:15.976 --> 48:18.562
I can… I can pay.

48:19.354 --> 48:21.356
I can… I can pay.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.068
I can… I can pay.

48:27.279 --> 48:32.326
I can… I'm sorry. I can… I… I can pay.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.787
I… I…

48:41.376 --> 48:44.671
Sorry for all the trouble.
She's going through a tough time.

49:11.573 --> 49:12.407
Luggage?

49:13.283 --> 49:14.242
This way, please.

49:47.984 --> 49:50.737
So Chase paid? Why? Was she broke?

49:50.821 --> 49:52.698
Broke? No way.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.533
Broken, perhaps.

49:56.493 --> 50:01.456
I've never seen anyone so fierce
turn so fragile so quickly.

50:10.549 --> 50:11.758
I'd say get a room,

50:11.842 --> 50:13.969
but with you two
that can be rather fraught.

50:14.052 --> 50:15.262
Good morning.

50:17.305 --> 50:18.557
I'm already late.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.392
So many shops, so little time.

50:28.650 --> 50:29.818
- Bye.
- Bye.

50:29.901 --> 50:30.819
Bye.

50:32.821 --> 50:35.115
This on-again, off-again
is giving me whiplash.

50:35.198 --> 50:37.993
What can I say? I'm in love with her.

50:38.076 --> 50:40.203
We had a long talk and she's just…

50:40.287 --> 50:43.498
She's now totally committed
to building Wake with me.

50:43.582 --> 50:46.793
And watching her,
how passionate she is, how smart.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.211
And posh.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.297
Once that trust of hers kicks in.

50:52.299 --> 50:54.301
I'm still covering her expenses.

50:55.343 --> 50:57.387
But yeah, someday soon.

50:57.471 --> 51:01.057
One way or another,
we'll be an unstoppable power couple.

51:04.102 --> 51:06.938
Listen, uh, I did what you asked.

51:08.273 --> 51:09.441
I checked her passport.

51:10.859 --> 51:11.860
And you were right.

51:13.445 --> 51:15.572
Her last name is listed as Sorokin.

51:15.655 --> 51:17.741
Not Delvey. It's Russian.

51:17.824 --> 51:19.785
Common as Smith, apparently.

51:19.868 --> 51:23.079
The passport is German,
but she was born outside of Moscow.

51:23.163 --> 51:25.373
I'm sure that
there's a logical explanation

51:25.457 --> 51:27.042
and I'm guessing it was traumatic,

51:27.125 --> 51:30.170
given what was on display
in the hotel lobby last night.

51:30.837 --> 51:34.007
Maybe they escaped.
You know, got run off by Putin.

51:34.090 --> 51:36.218
Or some oligarch's personal militia.

51:36.301 --> 51:37.594
But whatever happened,

51:37.677 --> 51:40.388
there is something
seriously broken inside of her,

51:40.472 --> 51:42.599
and we need to find a way to help her.

51:46.812 --> 51:47.687
Hello?

51:49.147 --> 51:50.065
I should go.

51:51.316 --> 51:53.902
I wouldn't have told you,
but if you saw how upset she was…

51:53.985 --> 51:56.112
No man, I appreciate it. Really.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.739
What about London? Are we still going?

51:57.823 --> 51:59.324
Uh, yeah.

51:59.407 --> 52:01.284
What are we going to do
about this situation?

52:01.368 --> 52:04.454
- This girl needs help.
- Don't worry. We'll talk about it later.

52:04.538 --> 52:05.705
Meet you at the hotel.

52:12.796 --> 52:13.880
<i>I met up with them.</i>

52:14.589 --> 52:16.049
<i>It wasn't even an hour later.</i>

52:16.675 --> 52:17.968
<i>Not even 60 minutes.</i>

52:20.554 --> 52:24.266
God, finally. Ten more minutes
and we'd have to swim the Channel.

52:24.349 --> 52:27.435
- You could have gone without us.
- Nonsense, you'd be lost without me.

52:27.519 --> 52:30.146
You'd be lost without your pills,
that's what I hear.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.147
Yeah.

52:31.231 --> 52:32.232
Okay.

52:33.108 --> 52:34.276
Did something happen?

52:34.359 --> 52:37.028
Something like
you rifling through people's bags.

52:37.779 --> 52:39.364
Checking their passports.

52:43.869 --> 52:44.744
He's joking.

52:47.497 --> 52:48.373
Chase!

52:50.709 --> 52:51.918
Tell her.

52:54.170 --> 52:55.547
He told me to do it.

52:56.381 --> 52:57.465
You told me to do it!

53:03.680 --> 53:06.808
You're fucking with me.
Oh, God. You fuckers.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.810
I would never do that to you.

53:12.397 --> 53:13.899
He told me to.

53:15.233 --> 53:18.653
- Chase? Tell her, you fuck!
- It's fucked up, Val.

53:19.321 --> 53:22.407
- It's just like a total invasion--
- You told me to do it!

53:22.490 --> 53:25.702
You begged me. I said no!
And then you begged me to.

53:25.785 --> 53:27.329
Sorry, my friends have gone insane.

53:27.412 --> 53:28.830
Bat-shit crazy.

53:28.914 --> 53:32.208
This is exactly the type of outburst
that is warranted in this situation.

53:35.712 --> 53:37.923
You're such a disappointment.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.926
You're entitled and unstable.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.846
And you are straight-up lying
about how all this went down.

53:44.930 --> 53:46.806
You're the one who went through her shit.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.768
That's fucked up, Val.
Can you not admit that?

53:50.894 --> 53:53.813
You are the fucked-up,
fucking psycho asshole

53:53.897 --> 53:56.775
who told me to check her fucking passport!

53:56.858 --> 54:00.403
- Sir, you must leave. Now.
- I couldn't agree more. He is using you.

54:01.696 --> 54:04.240
You know you're just
a walking piggy bank in his eyes.

54:06.534 --> 54:08.662
Now come on and let's get out of here.

54:13.249 --> 54:14.334
We'll miss our train.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.686
- See you around, Val.

55:08.096 --> 55:10.807
Oh, my God, that must have been horrible.

55:11.641 --> 55:12.517
Traumatic.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.894
Nothing in my world
lasts more than a season.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.105
Normcore, that was traumatic.

55:17.981 --> 55:21.735
But why would Anna turn on you like that?

55:21.818 --> 55:22.986
I don't understand.

55:23.069 --> 55:26.448
Stop following me. I've got work to do.

55:26.531 --> 55:28.158
Can you give me a contact for Chase?

55:31.453 --> 55:32.579
Wait!

55:33.663 --> 55:35.832
I still don't understand
why they dumped you.

55:35.915 --> 55:37.125
You did nothing wrong.

55:42.130 --> 55:42.964
Hey.

55:45.341 --> 55:46.676
What do they have her in?

55:47.510 --> 55:48.386
Orange?

55:49.304 --> 55:50.555
Grey.

55:52.348 --> 55:53.224
Good.

55:54.225 --> 55:55.101
Better.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.535
That beeping sound,

56:13.369 --> 56:15.747
that's the sound
the universe makes to inform you

56:15.830 --> 56:18.333
that you just fucked
yourself really, really hard.

56:36.851 --> 56:37.936
Fuck me.

57:14.806 --> 57:18.601
Check. Check. Check.

58:02.562 --> 58:03.646
Stevens!

58:21.664 --> 58:22.582
Sorokin!

58:26.586 --> 58:27.462
Sorokin!

58:28.922 --> 58:29.839
Hey!

58:30.840 --> 58:32.467
Sorokin, that's you!

58:43.811 --> 58:45.396
Where the hell have you been?

58:47.941 --> 58:49.359
We need to talk about Chase.

58:51.528 --> 58:53.279
Is he the reason you're in trouble?

58:55.573 --> 58:57.992
Or are you the reason
why I can't find him anywhere?

59:20.431 --> 59:22.684
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>to be friends with everyone.</i>

59:33.611 --> 59:37.615
<i>You think that there was some evolution,</i>
<i>like in the movies or whatever…</i>

59:47.166 --> 59:49.586
<i>but I was always who I am.</i>

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:13.484
Hey!

1:00:18.239 --> 1:00:19.907
We have to go. We're going to be late.

1:00:21.409 --> 1:00:23.369
God, what now?

1:00:23.453 --> 1:00:24.746
Sorokin?

1:00:25.788 --> 1:00:27.665
Or is it Sorokin?

1:00:27.749 --> 1:00:29.584
Anna Sorokin, <i>da?</i>

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:32.337
- I changed my name, so what?
- Your name or your identity?

1:00:32.420 --> 1:00:34.464
There are lots of Anna Sorokina.

1:00:35.256 --> 1:00:36.758
But only one Anna Delvey.

1:00:36.841 --> 1:00:38.926
Plus, it just sounds better.

1:00:39.010 --> 1:00:40.762
Better? As in, not Russian?

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:43.431
What the fuck?
Why are you sulking like a little baby?

1:00:43.514 --> 1:00:44.557
So you are Russian?

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:46.934
I was born there, who cares?

1:00:47.018 --> 1:00:48.561
- Who the fuck are you?
- Wh…

1:00:50.146 --> 1:00:52.231
We really
don't have time for this.

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:54.484
What else are you lying about?
Who the fuck are you?

1:00:54.567 --> 1:00:57.320
I do not have time for this!

1:00:57.403 --> 1:01:00.073
I do not have time for you!

1:01:07.747 --> 1:01:09.207
I have offered you everything I have

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:12.377
and you don't have the time
to tell me the truth about who you are?

1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:13.961
Who are you?

1:01:25.473 --> 1:01:27.725
I'm building something.

1:01:27.809 --> 1:01:32.146
A home. In New York.
For artists, for patrons.

1:01:32.230 --> 1:01:36.442
Studio spaces,
rotating exhibitions open for the public.

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:42.281
But also spaces for the most
exclusive and fabulous club of its kind.

1:01:42.365 --> 1:01:46.327
It will be the pinnacle
of the global art world,

1:01:46.411 --> 1:01:49.580
and I will stand at the top of it.

1:01:49.664 --> 1:01:52.083
The gatekeeper and the glue.

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:54.752
Who am I?

1:01:54.836 --> 1:01:59.841
This club,
this foundation will be who I am.

1:01:59.924 --> 1:02:02.218
What I am.

1:02:02.885 --> 1:02:05.388
I have to build this

1:02:06.222 --> 1:02:10.143
so artists and people like me
finally have a home.

1:02:10.852 --> 1:02:12.311
Somewhere safe.

1:02:13.479 --> 1:02:15.440
A place where they belong.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:16.858
A place where I belong.

1:02:26.534 --> 1:02:28.661
Are you going to stand in the way of that?

1:02:35.084 --> 1:02:36.294
Or help me?

1:02:38.796 --> 1:02:41.549
Tell me now because I can't.

1:02:42.508 --> 1:02:46.179
I honestly just have way too much to do.

1:02:47.555 --> 1:02:49.724
And I've wasted too much time as it is.

1:02:51.809 --> 1:02:52.769
It's beautiful.

1:02:54.187 --> 1:02:55.146
Let's…

1:02:57.398 --> 1:02:59.275
I want to help you realize this,

1:03:00.193 --> 1:03:01.778
whatever it takes.

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:05.531
Is where I'm born going to get
in the way of who I want to be?

1:03:06.574 --> 1:03:08.493
No. Why should it?

1:03:08.576 --> 1:03:13.289
Because I can't have anyone
questioning my background as I do this.

1:03:13.372 --> 1:03:15.708
- I know.
- No one.

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:16.751
They won't.

1:03:18.669 --> 1:03:19.587
You did.

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:21.297
Why?

1:03:24.926 --> 1:03:25.885
Your passport.

1:03:28.095 --> 1:03:30.389
You read my fucking passport?

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:31.307
No.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:33.643
Then who did?

1:03:39.065 --> 1:03:39.982
Val.

1:03:50.243 --> 1:03:51.077
No one?

1:03:54.997 --> 1:03:55.873
No one.
