Previously on
<i>The Lying Game...</i>

00:01.770 --> 00:02.969
Someone broke into your house.

00:02.969 --> 00:03.969
My house?

00:04.003 --> 00:05.638
Yeah, and they stole
the laptop.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.840
Absolutely everything
is on that.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.809
So, I found your laptop
inside Ethan's Jeep.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.510
He's the one who stole it.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.938
That's crazy!

00:12.972 --> 00:14.964
I'm so sorry. I'm-I'm
all over the place.

00:14.998 --> 00:16.952
I like the Emma version.

00:16.986 --> 00:19.583
I do feel like I can trust you.

00:20.719 --> 00:22.885
- Welcome to Arroyo.
- Thrilled to be here.

00:22.919 --> 00:25.798
This really is my number.
I'll see ya.

00:25.832 --> 00:28.597
Our birth mother wanted Emma
back so badly

00:28.632 --> 00:30.570
that she faked her identity
to come get her.

00:30.604 --> 00:33.550
Do you want me to drive you back
to your motel now?

00:33.584 --> 00:34.917
Could I stay at your place?

00:35.922 --> 00:38.760
That's you, Emma,
and our mother.

01:07.957 --> 01:10.693
(crickets chirping)

01:11.596 --> 01:14.766
(car accelerates)

01:15.869 --> 01:17.639
(panting)

01:28.722 --> 01:30.824
(car door opens)

01:30.858 --> 01:34.961
Young lady, you've got
some explaining to do.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.963
Alec?

01:36.997 --> 01:38.764
We worked like hell
for three years

01:38.799 --> 01:40.999
to get that new state-of-the-art
facility at Arroyo,

01:41.034 --> 01:43.602
and this is where
you choose to run?

01:46.005 --> 01:48.673
All right.

01:48.707 --> 01:50.975
So... where you headed?

01:51.009 --> 01:52.610
(panting)

01:52.644 --> 01:55.014
I got turned around.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.882
Really?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.985
This is the same route I used
to drive you and Mads

01:59.019 --> 02:02.690
to Little Tykes Gymnastics
twice a week

02:02.724 --> 02:05.726
all through
elementary school.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.997
Things look different at night.

02:10.866 --> 02:13.803
Come on.

02:13.837 --> 02:15.805
I'll give you a ride home.

âª

02:42.867 --> 02:46.603
I'm telling you, Ted,
she was shaking.

02:46.638 --> 02:47.704
That girl was
terrified.

02:47.739 --> 02:49.006
I think I know
my own daughter.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.842
You're describing
a totally different kid.

02:53.712 --> 02:55.847
I know she was asking
a lot of questions

02:55.881 --> 02:57.616
about her mother this summer,
right?

02:57.650 --> 02:58.784
Her birth mother, okay?

02:58.818 --> 03:00.753
And I told her
what I always tell her:

03:00.788 --> 03:03.022
the woman's dead.

03:04.692 --> 03:06.559
What are we
gonna tell her

03:06.594 --> 03:08.695
when she finds out
that isn't true?

03:08.729 --> 03:09.829
Look, I'm just
following the script, okay?

03:09.864 --> 03:10.897
You're the one who wrote it.

03:10.931 --> 03:13.567
Yeah, to protect you, right?

03:13.601 --> 03:15.702
You're the one
who screwed up.

03:15.736 --> 03:18.739
I have not forgotten.

03:18.773 --> 03:21.809
Look, we both have
a lot to lose.

03:21.843 --> 03:23.010
Yes.

03:23.044 --> 03:26.013
Okay? And I can't afford
to lose any more.

03:26.047 --> 03:29.016
So you keep an eye
on your kid.

03:29.050 --> 03:32.019
The last thing we need
is her snooping around L.A.

03:32.054 --> 03:36.858
Yeah, well, last time I checked,
she's still here in Phoenix.

03:36.893 --> 03:38.861
Can't be in two places
at once, right?

03:40.697 --> 03:41.931
You don't think that it's freaky

03:41.965 --> 03:44.968
that Alec just happens
to pull up behind me?

03:45.002 --> 03:47.771
Honestly, no.

03:47.805 --> 03:49.839
(sighs) Maybe I'm just still
weirded out

03:49.874 --> 03:51.041
about the whole laptop thing.

03:51.075 --> 03:54.845
I mean, if it was planted
in Ethan's car,

03:54.879 --> 03:56.780
then that means somebody
is out to get him,

03:56.814 --> 03:57.948
but who and why?

03:57.983 --> 04:00.751
Okay, Emma,
the clock is ticking,

04:00.785 --> 04:02.820
and sooner or later
someone is bound to figure out

04:02.854 --> 04:04.588
that I'm not there.

04:04.622 --> 04:08.692
And to be honest, I'm starting
to miss my life.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.761
Do you know the last time
I went this long

04:10.795 --> 04:12.796
without talking to Char or Mads?

04:12.831 --> 04:14.765
Never.

04:14.799 --> 04:17.535
They're pretty amazing.

04:17.569 --> 04:19.702
I mean,
they just seem it to me.

04:19.738 --> 04:21.606
They're your friends.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.008
Right.

04:23.042 --> 04:27.546
And eventually I'm going
to need to take my life back.

04:27.581 --> 04:29.548
I know.

04:29.583 --> 04:32.951
So we need to work really fast
to find our birth mother.

04:32.986 --> 04:35.721
And that photograph
is our only clue.

04:35.755 --> 04:39.824
Does it trigger any memories?

04:39.859 --> 04:41.726
No, nothing.

04:41.761 --> 04:43.795
I mean, I can't remember stuff
that happened last month

04:43.829 --> 04:46.698
much less a random day
when I was three.

04:46.732 --> 04:50.001
Really?
I can remember in detail

04:50.035 --> 04:52.036
almost anything
from my childhood.

04:52.071 --> 04:55.874
Well, you lived a life
worth remembering.

04:55.909 --> 04:59.979
Okay, I know this is hard,

05:00.013 --> 05:03.716
but I'm not the one
in that picture, you are.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.552
And you're the one
with the memories

05:06.586 --> 05:09.589
and you are the one that
can lead us to our mother.

05:11.925 --> 05:13.559
Now, at the arraignment,

05:13.594 --> 05:14.861
the first thing
your attorney's gonna do

05:14.895 --> 05:17.696
is enter a "not guilty" plea.

05:17.731 --> 05:20.566
You just better
hope the judge

05:20.601 --> 05:21.834
doesn't look at
all your priors

05:21.869 --> 05:23.670
and try you as an adult.

05:23.704 --> 05:25.605
Whoever planted
the laptop

05:25.640 --> 05:27.774
is trying to break up
Sutton and me.

05:27.808 --> 05:29.709
The only ones who knew about us

05:29.744 --> 05:31.544
were you, her parents
and Laurel...

05:31.579 --> 05:33.714
and whoever stole it.

05:33.748 --> 05:35.982
Sounds like an ironclad defense
to me.

05:36.017 --> 05:37.784
Ever think about going
to law school?

05:37.819 --> 05:41.955
Yeah, just be sure
and tuck your shirt

05:41.989 --> 05:44.791
all the way in
to hide the chili stain.

05:46.661 --> 05:47.928
You must love your job.

05:47.962 --> 05:50.564
Just look the judge
in the eye,

05:50.599 --> 05:52.800
don't give him any more
reasons not to believe you.

05:59.775 --> 06:02.643
Sutton Mercer
keeps a journal?

06:02.677 --> 06:04.979
Or are you updating
your enemies list?

06:05.014 --> 06:07.715
Hello, to you,
too, Nisha.

06:07.750 --> 06:08.916
Anything about me in there?

06:08.950 --> 06:12.953
No, sorry.
It's before I knew you.

06:12.987 --> 06:16.657
Before you knew...?
You mean, when you were three?

06:16.691 --> 06:19.726
Oh, I see, so we're just
revising history, huh?

06:19.760 --> 06:21.895
That's how we're playing it?
So we were never friends?

06:21.929 --> 06:25.765
Oh, okay, cool. Whatever.
I'm fine with it.

06:29.636 --> 06:32.739
INSTRUCTOR:
Nice and over, reach.

06:32.773 --> 06:34.875
Very nice. Lovely.

06:41.884 --> 06:43.719
Are you interested
in the ballet class?

06:43.754 --> 06:45.755
Me? Uh, no. In fact,

06:45.789 --> 06:48.024
ballet's, like, the last thing
in the world I'd want to do.

06:48.058 --> 06:52.028
Good, 'cause it requires
talent... and grace.

06:53.964 --> 06:55.798
My tennis coach

06:55.833 --> 06:57.601
is riding me about my footwork.

06:57.635 --> 06:59.736
Said I have to take some classes
if I want to keep

06:59.771 --> 07:00.970
the number one singles
spot, so this is

07:01.005 --> 07:02.806
basically detention
in a leotard.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.677
Ooh, does he teach?

07:06.711 --> 07:08.779
Eduardo? Oh, no,
he's a guest choreographer.

07:08.814 --> 07:09.947
He doesn't give private lessons.

07:09.982 --> 07:11.549
It's okay, Mom.

07:11.584 --> 07:12.784
Okay.

07:12.818 --> 07:15.987
How do you feel about teaching
gifted athletes?

07:16.022 --> 07:18.624
(knocking)
Got a minute?

07:18.658 --> 07:22.962
Yeah. Why does that sound
so ominous?

07:22.996 --> 07:26.766
It's just we haven't
had a chance

07:26.800 --> 07:28.001
to really talk about things

07:28.035 --> 07:29.803
since the dinner
with Ethan and...

07:29.837 --> 07:32.972
We... need to know that
you're not seeing him.

07:34.608 --> 07:37.743
But what if he's innocent?

07:37.777 --> 07:40.712
I mean, what if I know
that he didn't do it?

07:40.746 --> 07:43.614
If I know that he couldn't have
broken in?

07:43.649 --> 07:45.716
Hey, this isn't just
about the laptop, okay?

07:45.750 --> 07:47.618
I'm just not crazy
about this kid.

07:47.652 --> 07:49.820
He's got a juvie
rap sheet a mile long.

07:49.854 --> 07:53.758
So he's made some mistakes.

07:53.792 --> 07:55.994
Are you telling me
that when you were younger

07:56.028 --> 07:58.763
you didn't make mistakes?

07:58.797 --> 08:00.032
Look...
(doorbell rings)

08:00.066 --> 08:02.768
I'm gonna get that.

08:02.802 --> 08:04.837
Okay.

08:04.871 --> 08:06.872
Seriously, have you always
been perfect?

08:08.909 --> 08:12.545
There's nothing that you did
that you wish you could undo?

08:12.579 --> 08:14.814
Well, yeah, you know, actually,

08:14.848 --> 08:17.717
I did sport a mullet
briefly freshman year.

08:17.751 --> 08:20.619
(chuckles)
What what I thinking, right?

08:20.654 --> 08:22.921
This is making you
uncomfortable.

08:22.956 --> 08:26.891
Honey, okay, look, you have
to trust me on this.

08:26.926 --> 08:29.961
I only want what's
best for you.

08:29.995 --> 08:31.696
Okay.

08:32.998 --> 08:33.965
Okay.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.668
Okay.

08:39.006 --> 08:40.873
(sighs)

08:44.331 --> 08:45.626
There he is.

08:45.627 --> 08:46.950
You must be Justin.

08:46.951 --> 08:48.752
- Pleasure to meet you, Dr. Mercer.
- Yeah.

08:49.664 --> 08:52.532
I'll go get Laurel.
Thank you.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.417
So, Laurel tells me
you're quite a golfer.

08:55.418 --> 08:57.153
I wouldn't say that.

08:57.187 --> 08:58.588
I mean, I like getting out there
and walking the course,

08:58.622 --> 09:00.356
but I did make the school
team, though.

09:00.391 --> 09:02.058
Pretty stoked
about that.

09:02.092 --> 09:03.393
I'd love to get you
out there

09:03.427 --> 09:05.228
for a round at the club
if you wouldn't mind

09:05.263 --> 09:06.396
hacking around
with an old duffer.

09:06.431 --> 09:07.464
- Sure. That'd be awesome.
- All right.

09:07.499 --> 09:09.366
Hi.

09:09.401 --> 09:11.068
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:11.102 --> 09:12.469
Who's this
beautiful girl?

09:12.504 --> 09:14.505
We haven't even had
our first date yet,

09:14.539 --> 09:16.106
and you're already
hitting on him?

09:16.141 --> 09:17.441
He's a golfer.

09:17.475 --> 09:20.143
(whispers): Honey,
find out his handicap.

09:20.178 --> 09:21.345
(chuckles)

09:21.379 --> 09:23.547
You look amazing.

09:23.581 --> 09:25.248
- Thanks.
- Ready?

09:25.283 --> 09:28.083
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

09:28.118 --> 09:30.419
(guitarist playing
flamenco)

09:34.256 --> 09:36.357
You know, Metallica,

09:36.392 --> 09:38.427
they did an amazing
cover of this song.

09:42.131 --> 09:43.565
(plays flourish)

09:43.599 --> 09:45.300
Wow.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.135
Yeah, good job, good job.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.436
There you go.

09:50.406 --> 09:52.408
Thanks.

09:55.445 --> 09:58.547
Whoa, that's good.
Thank you.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.118
I've had a great time tonight.

10:03.153 --> 10:05.287
Me, too.

10:05.322 --> 10:09.258
I'm just glad you finally took
the hint and asked me out.

10:09.293 --> 10:10.527
What hint was that exactly?

10:10.561 --> 10:13.263
Um, giving my phone number
out to random girls?

10:13.297 --> 10:15.365
Okay, that might have been
a mistake.

10:15.399 --> 10:18.201
Yeah. You're telling me.

10:18.235 --> 10:20.370
You know what also
might have been a mistake?

10:20.404 --> 10:24.275
Uh, tipping that guy $50
instead of a five.

10:24.309 --> 10:25.609
No!
Uh. Yeah, no wonder

10:25.644 --> 10:27.278
he wanted to keep playing.

10:27.312 --> 10:29.247
(laughs)

10:29.281 --> 10:31.483
This is, uh,
this is embarrassing.

10:31.517 --> 10:33.218
I'm a little short.

10:33.252 --> 10:34.452
(chuckles)

10:34.487 --> 10:36.621
So cute. You're blushing.

10:36.655 --> 10:38.489
That's okay.

10:38.524 --> 10:41.158
I like being out
with a big tipper.

10:41.193 --> 10:42.359
Thank you.

10:42.393 --> 10:44.294
Mm-hmm.

10:44.329 --> 10:45.462
One hint, please?

10:45.496 --> 10:47.331
No.
I'm hating this.

10:47.365 --> 10:48.432
First, Sutton bolts
from my party

10:48.466 --> 10:50.200
for some cryptic
reason

10:50.234 --> 10:51.601
then you bail to chase
after your mystery guy.

10:51.636 --> 10:53.470
The last time I felt
this left out,

10:53.504 --> 10:55.639
I was wearing that headgear
in middle school.

10:55.674 --> 10:57.508
Oh... metal mouth.

10:57.543 --> 10:59.544
So not funny.

10:59.578 --> 11:02.113
Seriously, what's
happening to us?

11:02.148 --> 11:03.482
We used to tell each
other everything

11:03.516 --> 11:05.384
and now it's
secrets, secrets...

11:05.418 --> 11:08.120
Oh, my God.

11:08.155 --> 11:10.123
Justin and Laurel.

11:10.157 --> 11:13.159
Hmm.

11:15.629 --> 11:17.196
Hey, guys.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.232
We were just leaving.

11:20.267 --> 11:21.567
Oh, and we
just got here.

11:21.601 --> 11:23.269
Crazy, huh?

11:24.371 --> 11:27.338
So when did <i>this</i> happen?

11:27.373 --> 11:31.475
I would say since
the first moment I saw her.

11:32.577 --> 11:34.611
Oh.

11:34.645 --> 11:38.448
- See ya.
- Bye.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.289
(whimpered
moaning)

11:49.460 --> 11:52.662
(moaning)

11:55.533 --> 11:57.501
Sutton? Honey?

11:57.535 --> 12:00.237
Sutton. Oh, you're
having a bad dream.

12:00.272 --> 12:01.305
Sutton!

12:01.339 --> 12:03.508
(gasps)
It's okay.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.343
It's okay,
I'm right here.

12:05.378 --> 12:07.446
It was so real.
It's just a dream.

12:10.317 --> 12:11.584
Do you want to tell me about it?

12:13.353 --> 12:15.154
The dream?

12:15.188 --> 12:17.190
Breathe.

12:17.224 --> 12:20.226
I was... I was trapped...

12:20.260 --> 12:24.529
and I thought I was dying,
like, I couldn't breathe,

12:24.564 --> 12:26.398
and I was drowning.

12:26.432 --> 12:28.200
Oh, God.

12:28.234 --> 12:30.535
It's the first time in ages.

12:30.569 --> 12:33.271
What?

12:33.305 --> 12:36.141
Well, you had that nightmare
all the time.

12:36.176 --> 12:38.511
No, I know, I did. I...

12:38.545 --> 12:41.214
Wait, what?

12:41.248 --> 12:43.650
Well, don't tell me
you've forgotten?

12:46.387 --> 12:49.290
When I... was a kid?

12:49.324 --> 12:52.360
You're still shaking.
I'll tell you what,

12:52.394 --> 12:55.330
why don't I rub your back
until you fall back asleep?

12:55.364 --> 12:58.165
That's what always
used to work.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.333
I mean, unless

12:59.368 --> 13:01.502
you don't want me to. Then...

13:01.536 --> 13:05.572
No, I...
I would really love that.

13:05.606 --> 13:08.475
(quietly):
Okay.

13:13.614 --> 13:16.216
Okay.

13:16.251 --> 13:19.186
You're safe.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.222
I'm always here.

13:30.930 --> 13:32.931
And you can't draw a breath?
Totally.

13:32.966 --> 13:35.768
It's like I'm drowning
and I try to scream...

13:35.802 --> 13:38.637
- Yes, yes, but nothing comes out.
- And nothing comes out.

13:38.672 --> 13:40.906
- Whoa, this is... this is weird.
- You know, I read about this.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.476
It's a psychic connection
between identical twins.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.578
They even call it twinsense.

13:46.613 --> 13:49.514
I always thought it was a
little, like, woo-woo New Age-y,

13:49.548 --> 13:50.748
but obviously it's real.

13:50.783 --> 13:52.851
Maybe something traumatic

13:52.885 --> 13:54.886
happened to you and our mother

13:54.920 --> 13:57.689
and that's what the recurring
nightmare's about.

13:57.723 --> 13:59.791
I don't know,
that sounds kind of crazy.

13:59.825 --> 14:01.459
No, think about it.

14:01.494 --> 14:02.894
Whatever horrible thing
I'm dreaming,

14:02.929 --> 14:06.664
I never actually
experienced, but...

14:06.699 --> 14:09.767
It really happened to me.

14:09.802 --> 14:13.539
Maybe you can access the memory
of that trauma

14:13.574 --> 14:15.574
and that will lead us
to our birth mother.

14:15.609 --> 14:17.443
It's impossible.

14:17.477 --> 14:19.712
I am alone here.

14:19.747 --> 14:22.916
I have nobody to talk to, and...

14:22.951 --> 14:24.752
Should I ask your parents?

14:24.786 --> 14:27.755
No, forget it.
They'll just tell you more lies.

14:28.757 --> 14:30.758
(sighs)

14:30.793 --> 14:32.760
Okay, there's...

14:32.795 --> 14:38.566
one person that
you can talk to-- Ethan.

14:38.601 --> 14:39.901
(mouths)

14:39.936 --> 14:40.936
I don't want to...

14:40.970 --> 14:42.771
I don't want to cause a problem.

14:42.806 --> 14:43.839
Then don't.

14:45.976 --> 14:49.578
I mean, I'm used to losing
guys to you or Mads,

14:49.613 --> 14:52.949
but getting screwed over
by a sophomore? Not cool.

14:52.983 --> 14:57.487
Okay, don't be mad,
and I'm really sorry,

14:57.521 --> 15:01.424
but I'm kind of the one
that set them up.

15:01.459 --> 15:03.460
What?

15:03.494 --> 15:07.598
They already met, and they were
so into each other.

15:07.632 --> 15:10.600
I'm sorry, you're taking your sister's
side over your friend's?

15:10.635 --> 15:12.602
Mads, can you remind her
how wrong this is,

15:12.636 --> 15:13.903
because my head is
about to explode.

15:13.937 --> 15:16.805
MADS: I mean, sometimes
you can't just decide

15:16.840 --> 15:18.474
who you're going
to be with.

15:18.508 --> 15:20.642
Sometimes it's destiny.

15:20.677 --> 15:22.911
And look, we can always
find you another guy.

15:22.945 --> 15:24.446
It's not about the guy.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.847
It's about us.

15:25.882 --> 15:27.616
We used to have
each other's back,

15:27.650 --> 15:29.885
and now it's like
we're drifting.

15:29.919 --> 15:31.787
I'm hating this.

15:34.624 --> 15:35.925
Wow, Sutton screwing
over a friend.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.793
Who would ever
see that coming?

15:37.828 --> 15:39.896
You don't know what you're
talking about, Nisha.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.941
My palms are
actually sweating.

15:49.975 --> 15:53.878
I hope Sutton's friends are going
to be okay with, you know, us.

15:53.913 --> 15:58.483
Well, they will have plenty
of time to get used to it.

15:58.517 --> 16:02.420
Oh, that was so
the right thing to say.

16:02.454 --> 16:06.456
I am going to get us
something to drink.

16:10.461 --> 16:11.861
Waiting for anyone I might know?

16:11.896 --> 16:13.697
Number one on the parental
disapproval list--

16:13.731 --> 16:15.699
name begins with "E"?

16:15.733 --> 16:18.568
Look, I know Mom and Dad
want me to break it off,

16:18.603 --> 16:20.503
but I just...
I really need to see him.

16:20.538 --> 16:22.472
Well, you're not going
to find him here.

16:23.708 --> 16:25.876
Have you not heard?
Ethan's been suspended.

16:25.911 --> 16:27.612
For stealing
your laptop.

16:27.646 --> 16:29.547
He even lost his
job at the club.

16:29.581 --> 16:30.648
Sutton, your boy's

16:30.683 --> 16:31.883
in some deep doo-doo.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.818
Thanks.

16:38.657 --> 16:41.559
Ethan. Oh, my God,
are you... are you okay?

16:41.593 --> 16:43.461
How are you doing?

16:43.495 --> 16:46.564
Uh, suspended,
fired, arraigned.

16:46.599 --> 16:48.633
Same old, same old.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.501
No, seriously,
I'm worried about you.

16:50.536 --> 16:52.570
Why won't you tell me?

16:52.604 --> 16:55.540
Figured you were pretty
busy with that picture.

16:56.875 --> 16:59.777
So how's that
going, anyway?

16:59.812 --> 17:01.779
Uh, so far, nada.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.548
Actually, I was hoping
that you could help me

17:04.582 --> 17:07.818
dredge up some memories
or interpret some dreams.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.721
Oh, yeah, sure.

17:10.755 --> 17:13.624
You know what, I'll bring
along some peyote

17:13.657 --> 17:16.527
and my favorite dream catcher,
and then we can go off

17:16.561 --> 17:19.497
and do a harvest dance and
duck into my sweat lodge.

17:19.531 --> 17:21.800
Not because
of your heritage.

17:21.834 --> 17:25.804
No, because you're the
only friend that I have.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.640
We have-- Sutton and me.

17:27.674 --> 17:28.774
All right.

17:28.808 --> 17:30.676
How about tonight, the overlook?

17:30.710 --> 17:32.844
We can meet up there
around 9:00.

17:32.878 --> 17:34.646
We could try to put it off,

17:34.680 --> 17:36.647
but then it might have to be
behind bulletproof glass.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.649
What are you talking about?

17:38.684 --> 17:41.552
Guess they were tired
of seeing me in juvie.

17:41.586 --> 17:43.653
They set my trial
for next week.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.888
As an adult.

17:44.922 --> 17:46.689
(engine starting)

17:50.829 --> 17:52.462
(groans)

17:52.497 --> 17:55.932
Mark Twain was right--
a good walk spoiled.

17:55.967 --> 17:58.468
Yeah, says the man
who won every skin.

17:58.503 --> 18:00.471
Just caught some luck, really.

18:00.505 --> 18:02.740
Yeah, in your DNA.

18:02.774 --> 18:04.742
Here you go.

18:04.777 --> 18:06.811
It was fun getting out there,
playing with you guys.

18:06.845 --> 18:08.479
I'm not taking your money.

18:08.514 --> 18:09.747
I insist. I'm a
man of my word.

18:09.782 --> 18:11.549
So is Ted Mercer,
isn't that right?

18:11.583 --> 18:13.451
You earned it,
Justin. Take it.

18:13.485 --> 18:15.419
Well, Laurel's, uh, up there.

18:15.453 --> 18:16.587
I should probably
get going.

18:16.621 --> 18:18.655
- Good round.
- Thanks.

18:18.689 --> 18:20.457
ALEC:
Never seen you so worked up

18:20.491 --> 18:21.758
about your lousy
putting game, man.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.592
TED:
Make one mistake,

18:23.627 --> 18:26.462
you have to pay for it
the rest of your life.

18:29.465 --> 18:30.765
One mistake.

18:30.799 --> 18:32.767
(sighs)

18:32.802 --> 18:34.669
I think you might be
right about Sutton.

18:34.703 --> 18:36.671
I think she knows something.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.642
You keep on her.

18:40.676 --> 18:43.544
It's not important what
she thinks she knows.

18:43.579 --> 18:47.482
What's important is she
never finds her mother.

18:51.954 --> 18:54.489
EDUARDO:
No, no.

18:54.523 --> 18:55.856
This is ballet.

18:55.891 --> 18:57.692
It should be
light, graceful.

18:57.726 --> 18:58.893
First position.

18:58.927 --> 19:00.661
Let's try the
battement tendus again.

19:00.696 --> 19:01.862
Knock, knock.

19:01.897 --> 19:03.397
Hey.

19:03.432 --> 19:04.865
Brought you a smoothie.

19:04.899 --> 19:06.800
Mango-papaya-- your favorite.

19:06.835 --> 19:08.435
Mads, you're
the best.

19:08.470 --> 19:09.570
Hey, while I have you,

19:09.604 --> 19:10.804
can you demonstrate
a proper tendus?

19:10.839 --> 19:12.440
Love to.

19:12.474 --> 19:14.442
Thank you.

19:27.858 --> 19:30.660
Obviously, I don't expect
you to be as good as Mads,

19:30.694 --> 19:33.463
but next time, I'd like
to see some improvement.

19:33.497 --> 19:34.664
I'll see you next week.

19:37.935 --> 19:41.637
Hey, maybe you could find a boy
at school to practice with.

19:41.671 --> 19:45.775
Dance doesn't really come to
life until you have a partner.

19:49.779 --> 19:52.448
I want to talk to you
about Ethan.

19:52.482 --> 19:54.550
Honey, we've
discussed this.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.586
And this is hardly the
time or the place...

19:56.620 --> 19:58.888
It's okay,
let her finish, Ted.

19:58.922 --> 20:00.890
Look, he was with me

20:00.924 --> 20:02.792
when our house was broken into,

20:02.826 --> 20:04.794
and he had no motive
to want the laptop.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.862
So I think that there's
something else going on here.

20:06.897 --> 20:10.500
- Like what?
- A conspiracy?

20:10.534 --> 20:12.803
Sutton,
you're my goddaughter,

20:12.837 --> 20:15.939
and the last thing I want
is to see you unhappy.

20:15.974 --> 20:17.674
I know you care
for this boy, but...

20:17.709 --> 20:19.510
Then why won't
you help him?

20:19.544 --> 20:21.646
Because a life lesson here
is more important.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.515
Worse case-- he goes to jail,
he does a little time.

20:24.550 --> 20:25.783
He thinks
about his mistakes,

20:25.817 --> 20:28.486
he comes out

20:28.520 --> 20:30.955
a more productive citizen,
like his brother.

20:30.990 --> 20:32.791
And what if he's innocent?

20:32.825 --> 20:34.626
Innocent?

20:34.660 --> 20:36.762
If he's innocent,
then who broke into your house,

20:36.796 --> 20:38.797
stole your property

20:38.832 --> 20:41.634
and planted it
to make him look guilty?

20:41.668 --> 20:43.803
That just...
doesn't make any sense.

20:43.838 --> 20:45.739
If he's
not guilty,

20:45.773 --> 20:47.974
then who's
the guilty party?

20:48.009 --> 20:49.609
LAUREL:
I am.

20:49.644 --> 20:50.911
It was me.

20:50.945 --> 20:54.547
I staged the break-in
and I stole the laptop.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.984
It was all me.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.306
I guess I was

21:07.089 --> 21:10.092
while I played this supporting
role in the Sutton story.

21:10.126 --> 21:12.895
TED: And this was your
mature way of expressing

21:12.929 --> 21:15.331
some sort of sibling jealousy?
Frame an innocent kid?

21:15.366 --> 21:19.303
He's her boyfriend, and I
couldn't stand to see her happy.

21:21.006 --> 21:22.172
Poor Ethan.

21:22.207 --> 21:23.974
I've already talked to Alec.

21:24.008 --> 21:25.208
All of the charges
have been dropped.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.210
He's going to be
back at school tomorrow,

21:27.245 --> 21:29.913
and he's getting
his old job back.

21:29.947 --> 21:31.147
And what about his reputation?

21:31.181 --> 21:33.048
You can't just undo this,
you know?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.984
I know.

21:35.018 --> 21:38.320
I just wish I could
turn back the clock.

21:38.355 --> 21:40.189
Well, I'll tell you
what you can do--

21:40.223 --> 21:41.256
you can forget about

21:41.290 --> 21:43.258
any dances,
parties, dates.

21:43.292 --> 21:45.126
You're grounded, young lady.

21:46.261 --> 21:48.962
It's what I deserve.

21:56.970 --> 21:59.038
Are you okay?

21:59.072 --> 22:03.075
And the Oscar goes to...

22:03.110 --> 22:05.912
Laurel Mercer
for <i>The Sutton Story.</i>

22:05.946 --> 22:09.883
Tell me that turning-back-
the-clock stuff wasn't inspired.

22:09.917 --> 22:12.185
You didn't steal anything.

22:12.219 --> 22:14.321
Duh. I really am
the perfect child.

22:14.356 --> 22:16.290
But hey,
you brought me love.

22:16.324 --> 22:18.126
Just returning the favor.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.228
Come here.

22:20.262 --> 22:22.263
Seriously?
We're gonna hug it out?

22:22.298 --> 22:24.265
Okay, but hurry, because
with all this tenderness,

22:24.299 --> 22:25.266
I really am about to vomit.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.901
Wait a minute.

22:26.935 --> 22:28.902
How are you gonna see Justin
now?

22:28.937 --> 22:31.238
Uh, how long have you been
in this family?

22:31.272 --> 22:33.273
In a week, Mom and Dad
will feel guilty and back off.

22:33.307 --> 22:35.341
Maybe this was a cry for help.

22:35.376 --> 22:37.309
And until then,
how grounded am I really

22:37.344 --> 22:39.311
when my big sister
has that window door thingy

22:39.346 --> 22:42.914
that does tend
to remain unlocked.

22:42.948 --> 22:46.284
You... are... evil.

22:46.318 --> 22:49.020
I learned from the master.

22:59.266 --> 23:01.867
Oh, this is good.
This is very good.

23:01.901 --> 23:03.068
Hmm?

23:03.103 --> 23:05.103
Check it out.
Pixels are filling in

23:05.138 --> 23:07.940
and the resolution
is super clear.

23:07.974 --> 23:09.141
We're gonna get a read
on that water tower

23:09.175 --> 23:10.375
behind your mom
and Emma.

23:12.011 --> 23:14.312
And, my friend,
we have a location.

23:14.347 --> 23:17.048
"Fillmore, California."

23:17.082 --> 23:18.349
You up for
a road trip?

23:18.383 --> 23:20.050
Oh, my God,
this is amazing.

23:20.085 --> 23:21.952
I know.
(squeals)

23:32.331 --> 23:35.034
(doorbell rings)

23:40.308 --> 23:43.377
Ethan, uh,
I thought we said later.

23:43.411 --> 23:44.979
TED:
Oh, good, you're here.

23:45.013 --> 23:46.213
Come on in.

23:46.248 --> 23:47.414
I'll just be a sec.

23:50.219 --> 23:51.986
Uh, come in.

23:52.020 --> 23:54.155
Okay.

23:57.193 --> 24:00.996
Ethan, you have no idea
how awful we feel about

24:01.031 --> 24:02.898
what you've had
to go through.

24:02.932 --> 24:04.933
I'm so, so sorry.

24:04.968 --> 24:08.104
Thank you, Mrs. Mercer.

24:08.138 --> 24:10.173
Hello.

24:10.207 --> 24:13.376
Laurel, don't you have something
to say to this young man?

24:15.312 --> 24:17.881
I'm really sorry
about what I did.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.349
I know it's
no excuse,

24:19.383 --> 24:22.018
but I didn't think it
was going to spin

24:22.052 --> 24:24.087
so out of control.

24:24.121 --> 24:27.323
I mean, if I could
turn back the clock...

24:27.358 --> 24:30.093
ETHAN:
Oh, hey, it's all right.

24:30.127 --> 24:31.261
No worries.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.896
KRISTIN: It's very gracious
of you, Ethan.

24:32.930 --> 24:36.232
So sorry again.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.367
Laurel.

24:39.237 --> 24:41.037
Well, do you...

24:41.072 --> 24:45.308
I probably want to get back
to my brother.

24:45.342 --> 24:47.277
Yeah, I'm gonna walk Ethan out.

24:50.047 --> 24:51.281
Okay.

24:57.221 --> 25:00.223
This was nice of
you, Dr. Mercer.

25:00.257 --> 25:01.991
It's my wife's idea, son.

25:02.026 --> 25:04.227
Have a nice night.

25:04.261 --> 25:06.229
Okay.

25:15.104 --> 25:18.072
All day long
I've been dreaming about this.

25:18.106 --> 25:19.207
Wait.

25:20.275 --> 25:22.243
We can't do this.

25:22.277 --> 25:26.180
But the other night,
that kiss...

25:26.214 --> 25:28.082
I know. I've had time
to think about it,

25:28.116 --> 25:30.952
and, Mads, you're 17.

25:30.986 --> 25:33.889
Who cares about our age
difference?

25:33.923 --> 25:35.256
Uh, the State of Arizona,
for starters.

25:35.291 --> 25:37.892
Are you making fun of me?

25:37.927 --> 25:39.061
I'm not, Mads.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.332
I think you're
an amazing person.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.169
And I won't lie,
that kiss...

25:46.204 --> 25:48.972
it took my breath away.

25:52.979 --> 25:54.412
But I can't.

25:56.149 --> 25:57.282
Stop fighting it.

26:00.954 --> 26:02.922
There's no point.

26:02.956 --> 26:05.157
Maybe if we met at another...

26:05.192 --> 26:08.027
(shutter clicking)

26:10.197 --> 26:11.297
No!

26:11.332 --> 26:14.934
I'm sorry.

26:14.969 --> 26:16.235
You should go.

26:40.328 --> 26:42.028
Hey, you.

26:42.063 --> 26:45.965
So, I was cleaning out
my closet and found...

26:46.000 --> 26:47.233
this.

26:47.268 --> 26:49.135
You must have left it
at our last movie night.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.037
Which was, like, two years ago.

26:51.072 --> 26:53.273
We had a lot
of great times here,

26:53.307 --> 26:55.108
but I guess it's been
a while, huh?

26:55.142 --> 26:58.077
Yeah, I don't know. Whatever.

26:58.112 --> 26:59.946
Could you toss me
that towel?

26:59.980 --> 27:03.282
Swimming solo.
That's a first.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.184
Aren't you supposed to
be with your friends?

27:05.218 --> 27:07.019
They have plans.

27:07.053 --> 27:11.123
Hmm. Look, I like you,
Char, always have,

27:11.157 --> 27:14.226
but eventually
you're gonna get hurt

27:14.260 --> 27:18.063
because once Sutton decides
she's over you, she's over you.

27:18.098 --> 27:22.201
I don't think Sutton hates you
as much as you think she does.

27:22.235 --> 27:24.036
Well, I don't know.

27:24.070 --> 27:26.137
Look, I know you have this

27:26.172 --> 27:28.873
whole conspiracy theory
about us,

27:28.908 --> 27:30.142
but Mads and I
never set out

27:30.176 --> 27:32.110
to replace you
as Sutton's best friend.

27:32.145 --> 27:34.980
You know what? I'm over it.

27:35.014 --> 27:37.149
Well, don't act all blameless.

27:37.183 --> 27:39.117
You've done plenty
of stuff to us.

27:39.151 --> 27:41.019
Mads included.

27:41.053 --> 27:43.288
Like, lying, backstabbing,
acting all sneaky.

27:43.322 --> 27:45.023
Oh, I'm sneaky?

27:45.057 --> 27:47.292
I'm not the one who's having
an affair

27:47.326 --> 27:49.060
with my ballet teacher.

27:50.962 --> 27:54.098
I'm sure she already told you.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.366
You guys are all best buds.

28:01.907 --> 28:03.841
You do realize you were
cleared of all charges?

28:03.875 --> 28:05.242
I mean, that's a
good thing, isn't it?

28:05.276 --> 28:10.146
Whoever stole the laptop, tried
to frame me and stop Sutton

28:10.180 --> 28:11.914
is still out there.

28:11.949 --> 28:16.185
You know, it's not such
a good thing.

28:16.219 --> 28:19.087
Okay, I don't mean to sound
like Sutton here,

28:19.122 --> 28:21.256
but I think we should just
put the laptop stuff aside

28:21.291 --> 28:24.159
and concentrate on this.

28:24.193 --> 28:27.997
- You're right.
- Okay.

28:28.031 --> 28:29.265
How's it going, anyway?

28:29.299 --> 28:32.936
I'd say progress is glacial,

28:32.970 --> 28:37.041
except glaciers actually do move
eventually.

28:37.075 --> 28:39.343
Okay, all right, let's...

28:39.378 --> 28:42.280
let's try to focus
on the nightmare.

28:42.314 --> 28:44.950
Like, close your eyes.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.087
(sighs)

28:49.122 --> 28:52.991
All I remember is...

28:53.025 --> 28:56.161
not being able to breathe,

28:56.195 --> 28:59.030
like I was drowning.

29:00.299 --> 29:03.101
Okay, let's do something else.

29:03.135 --> 29:06.271
All right, here,
then try a good memory.

29:06.306 --> 29:07.973
You know,
just something small.

29:08.007 --> 29:11.944
Anything, like a nice time,
whatever.

29:18.218 --> 29:19.852
Okay, this is hopeless.

29:19.886 --> 29:21.254
You know what I'm
thinking about?

29:21.288 --> 29:24.223
Kristin comforting me the other
night after my nightmare.

29:24.258 --> 29:28.861
Yeah, that's
not gonna help.

29:28.896 --> 29:30.130
I know that.

29:30.164 --> 29:32.932
It's just that she's been
so good to me

29:32.966 --> 29:36.001
and I feel more of a bond
with her than

29:36.036 --> 29:40.271
I do with this
stranger.

29:40.305 --> 29:41.906
I'm sorry.

29:41.941 --> 29:45.209
This person means
nothing to me.

30:10.203 --> 30:12.304
I... I wasn't drowning.

30:12.338 --> 30:17.242
The reason I couldn't breath
was... I was trapped in a fire.

30:19.961 --> 30:22.008
Well, we've learned one more
clue about your birth mother.

30:23.090 --> 30:25.792
She had a terrible
Realtor.

30:25.827 --> 30:27.227
I mean, come on.
You're in California.

30:27.262 --> 30:30.131
There's Santa Cruz,
Palm Springs, Big Sur,

30:30.165 --> 30:32.100
and she picks Fillmore?

30:32.134 --> 30:34.135
Is this helping?

30:34.170 --> 30:37.806
Sorry. Just trying
to lighten the mood.

30:37.841 --> 30:41.043
I hate to see you so down
after all your hard work.

30:41.078 --> 30:44.046
I think we're
missing something.

30:44.081 --> 30:46.015
Like what?

30:46.049 --> 30:48.016
The feed store's long gone,

30:48.051 --> 30:49.885
nobody knows the woman
in the photo.

30:49.919 --> 30:52.221
It's not like we have
a name that we could track.

30:52.255 --> 30:55.925
We're at a dead end.

30:55.959 --> 30:58.027
(phone rings)

30:58.061 --> 31:02.030
Hmm, maybe Emma
will have better luck.

31:02.064 --> 31:05.900
- I was in a fire.
- What? Are you okay?

31:05.935 --> 31:08.236
No, no, when I was little
with our birth mother.

31:08.270 --> 31:10.172
That's what
the nightmare was about.

31:10.206 --> 31:12.140
That's why I couldn't breath.

31:12.175 --> 31:13.908
It wasn't drowning.

31:13.943 --> 31:16.878
It was smoke. I was trapped
in a burning house.

31:16.912 --> 31:18.846
That's what you need to be
looking for.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.083
(school bell rings)

31:22.117 --> 31:24.219
There you are.

31:24.253 --> 31:25.921
Here, got you this.

31:25.955 --> 31:27.189
Two-percent, one
sugar, extra foam.

31:27.223 --> 31:28.257
Keep it.

31:28.291 --> 31:30.193
Probably bought it
for someone else.

31:30.227 --> 31:33.096
Whoa. Why are you
acting this way?

31:33.130 --> 31:36.100
What's going on with you
and Eduardo?

31:36.134 --> 31:39.871
Okay, do we have
to do this here?

31:39.905 --> 31:42.173
Oh, my God, it's true.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.843
You're having sex with him.

31:44.877 --> 31:47.078
And of course, old Char's
the last one to know.

31:47.113 --> 31:50.048
It's the eighth-grade Grand
Canyon trip all over again.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.083
Okay, calm down.

31:52.117 --> 31:54.119
She seems calm to me-- she's
just waiting for an answer.

31:54.153 --> 31:56.221
Are you sleeping
with Eduardo?

31:58.090 --> 31:59.791
Yes.

31:59.825 --> 32:02.160
Yes, I am.

32:02.194 --> 32:03.861
We've been together for,
like, six months how,

32:03.896 --> 32:06.097
and we can't keep our hands
off each other.

32:06.131 --> 32:07.866
How about you, Nisha?

32:07.900 --> 32:09.167
You seeing anyone?

32:09.201 --> 32:11.002
Any cute freshmen
on the boys' tennis team?

32:13.940 --> 32:17.109
Wow, nice flow,
good color scheme.

32:17.143 --> 32:20.812
What? Look, I'm just
trying to be positive, okay?

32:20.847 --> 32:22.047
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

32:22.081 --> 32:24.082
Honestly, I think
it's a tear-down.

32:24.116 --> 32:27.052
I say we offer way below
the asking price.

32:28.855 --> 32:30.188
You think this is
really the place?

32:30.222 --> 32:32.991
Well, the neighbors said
the fire was about 14 years ago.

32:33.025 --> 32:34.926
So time-wise,
it makes sense,

32:34.961 --> 32:36.795
but only Emma
will know for sure.

32:36.830 --> 32:39.231
Oh, when she calls,
just remember...

32:39.266 --> 32:41.968
Not let Emma see me.
I know, I know.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.803
Have no fear.

32:43.837 --> 32:45.905
I shall remain
your dirty little secret.

32:45.940 --> 32:47.006
Shut up.

32:47.041 --> 32:50.977
(phone rings)
Oh.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.914
Hi, I'm here.

32:53.949 --> 32:55.216
Or at least I think I am.

32:55.250 --> 32:57.285
Uh, you have to tell me, though.

32:57.319 --> 33:00.188
Here.

33:00.222 --> 33:02.091
You getting any of this, Emma?

33:02.125 --> 33:04.826
I don't know.
It's really vague.

33:05.962 --> 33:06.961
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

33:06.996 --> 33:08.830
There. In the doorway.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.064
There was a swing. I...

33:10.099 --> 33:13.033
I remember a swing.

33:13.067 --> 33:15.268
Incredible.

33:17.972 --> 33:21.006
And... there were stars.
There were...

33:21.041 --> 33:23.242
beautiful stars.

33:23.276 --> 33:26.145
Stars...

33:26.179 --> 33:27.980
stars...

33:32.920 --> 33:34.153
SUTTON: Whoa.

33:34.188 --> 33:35.822
I know that room.

33:35.856 --> 33:37.991
That's my room. I...

33:38.025 --> 33:40.827
My crib was right on that wall.

33:40.861 --> 33:42.963
Okay, I can't believe I'm
standing in the place where

33:42.997 --> 33:46.066
our mother... lived
and-and possibly died.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.967
But I don't...

33:48.002 --> 33:50.303
There should be stars.
I don't see stars.

33:54.076 --> 33:55.944
Oh. Oh, my God.

33:55.978 --> 33:56.978
What? What? What is it?

34:17.098 --> 34:20.766
I remember I used
to fall asleep

34:20.801 --> 34:22.768
staring at those stars.

34:22.803 --> 34:24.837
Wait, there's something there.

34:28.274 --> 34:29.808
It's...

34:29.842 --> 34:31.909
it's signed.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.813
Annie Hobbs.

34:36.916 --> 34:39.117
Our mother's name
was Annie Hobbs.

34:48.596 --> 34:50.364
I can't believe you
remember all this.

34:53.668 --> 34:55.502
(sighs)

34:55.536 --> 34:57.570
But why can't I remember
the important things?

34:57.605 --> 35:01.341
Like did my mom
make it out alive?

35:01.375 --> 35:05.545
Or... did she sacrifice
her life for mine?

35:05.579 --> 35:09.482
Hey, easy. You don't
know any of that.

35:09.516 --> 35:11.517
But I have a right to.

35:11.552 --> 35:15.522
It's my life story,
and my past... and Sutton's.

35:15.556 --> 35:17.424
And...

35:17.459 --> 35:18.659
nobody should keep that from us.

35:20.395 --> 35:21.629
Uh, you're losing me.

35:21.663 --> 35:25.667
Okay. Let's say
you adopt a baby

35:25.701 --> 35:28.570
and the birth mother has twins.

35:30.406 --> 35:31.573
You mean you wouldn't know that?

35:31.608 --> 35:33.576
Or at least be curious
enough to find out?

35:35.412 --> 35:36.579
I guess every adoption
is different, probably.

35:36.613 --> 35:37.580
No.

35:37.614 --> 35:39.582
This isn't a story in Dickens.

35:39.617 --> 35:42.552
This is L.A. in the mid-90s.

35:42.586 --> 35:44.487
Okay, all right, well,
what are you saying?

35:44.521 --> 35:48.524
I'm saying, I...

35:48.558 --> 35:51.526
I get this weird feeling
from Ted.

35:51.561 --> 35:53.428
Like he knows.

35:53.463 --> 35:56.331
About me, or...

35:56.366 --> 35:58.666
the fire, and what happened
to Annie Hobbs.

35:58.701 --> 36:00.735
But why would he keep that all
a secret?

36:02.571 --> 36:04.472
KRISTIN:
<i>How fun was that?</i>

36:04.506 --> 36:07.608
And why haven't we done
this in, like, forever?

36:07.642 --> 36:09.476
(giggles)

36:09.511 --> 36:12.379
I know. I... you're,
you were good out there.

36:12.413 --> 36:13.547
Oh, thank you.

36:13.581 --> 36:15.482
I was just trying to
get the ball back.

36:15.516 --> 36:18.585
But your backhand, wow!

36:18.619 --> 36:21.588
We know you didn't
get that from me.

36:21.623 --> 36:23.590
Oh. I'm sorry.

36:23.625 --> 36:24.692
I didn't mean that.

36:24.726 --> 36:27.394
It's okay.
Hmm.

36:27.429 --> 36:31.699
Actually, I... I wanted
to ask you about her.

36:31.734 --> 36:34.602
My birth mother.

36:34.637 --> 36:36.504
I know she died,

36:36.539 --> 36:40.608
but... do you know how
it happened? Or when?

36:40.642 --> 36:43.610
I mean, could she have...
drowned, or...

36:43.645 --> 36:46.346
been in a fire?

36:46.380 --> 36:47.447
Oh, honey.

36:47.481 --> 36:50.317
This... this is about
your bad dream.

36:50.351 --> 36:52.618
I... I don't know.

36:52.653 --> 36:55.354
I honestly...

36:55.388 --> 36:56.655
I have no idea.

36:58.424 --> 37:00.493
Oh. Okay.

37:00.527 --> 37:02.562
Can I tell you something
I've never admitted to anyone,

37:02.596 --> 37:04.564
not even your dad?

37:04.598 --> 37:06.499
Yeah.

37:06.533 --> 37:09.402
I wish I could've met her.

37:09.436 --> 37:10.570
Really?

37:10.604 --> 37:12.506
Yes.

37:12.540 --> 37:14.474
Then I could've had the chance
to thank her

37:14.509 --> 37:16.711
for the greatest gift
I've ever had.

37:16.745 --> 37:18.579
You.

37:32.659 --> 37:35.427
(door lock rattling)

37:35.462 --> 37:37.529
(doorknob turns)

37:37.563 --> 37:39.764
(rattling)

37:44.604 --> 37:46.305
Ethan.

37:46.340 --> 37:47.473
Um...

37:47.508 --> 37:49.542
Sutton's not home yet, so...

37:49.577 --> 37:51.377
you can just make yourself
comfy until she...

37:51.412 --> 37:52.646
(laptop rings)

37:52.680 --> 37:54.648
Allow me.

37:54.682 --> 37:56.516
LAUREL:
Hey, where are you?

37:56.551 --> 37:58.318
We've got company.

37:58.353 --> 37:59.386
Laurel.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.455
Hey.

38:01.489 --> 38:02.689
Uh, I was just calling

38:02.724 --> 38:05.492
I-I'm running late.
to tell Ethan

38:05.526 --> 38:07.394
It's fine.

38:07.428 --> 38:08.595
You know what? I'll just...
I'll come back later.

38:08.629 --> 38:10.497
I'll just call back.
No, that's fine,

38:10.531 --> 38:12.465
LAUREL:
No, don't be silly. Stay.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.501
Sit. Later, sis.

38:14.535 --> 38:16.636
(mouths)

38:18.372 --> 38:20.573
(whispers):
Might want to keep this closed.

38:22.476 --> 38:24.577
All right.

38:29.584 --> 38:31.685
(Ethan sighs)

38:33.655 --> 38:35.556
Okay. I cannot do this anymore.

38:35.590 --> 38:37.358
You have to come home.

38:37.392 --> 38:38.559
Soon, I promise.

38:38.593 --> 38:40.461
But the search is heating up.

38:40.495 --> 38:42.463
I... don't think we should quit.

38:42.497 --> 38:44.331
I'm not talking about quitting,
I just...

38:44.365 --> 38:46.499
I think we need to look here.

38:46.534 --> 38:48.668
I think your dad is hiding
something, but...

38:48.702 --> 38:51.605
with your mom,
we may have an opening.

38:51.639 --> 38:54.508
If she wanted to help,
she would've done it already.

38:54.543 --> 38:57.411
I have a name, Emma,
and I want to track it down.

38:57.446 --> 38:59.613
Look. You knew her.

38:59.648 --> 39:03.517
Okay? She held you
and played with you,

39:03.551 --> 39:06.552
and sang to you.

39:06.587 --> 39:08.354
I never had that.

39:09.589 --> 39:11.557
I want to find our mother.

39:11.591 --> 39:14.359
I need to find her.

39:19.598 --> 39:21.699
(sighs)

39:23.701 --> 39:25.469
What am I going to do?

39:25.503 --> 39:27.605
I can't keep hurting
these people.

39:30.408 --> 39:32.477
You... you just
have to hope

39:32.511 --> 39:34.378
they're going to
understand all this.

39:34.413 --> 39:37.482
(laughs)
And that they'll forgive you.

39:37.516 --> 39:39.683
They're not going
to forgive me.

39:39.718 --> 39:42.587
They'll forgive Sutton.

39:42.621 --> 39:44.355
But...

39:44.390 --> 39:46.524
I'm...

39:46.559 --> 39:49.327
I'm nobody to them. They...

39:49.361 --> 39:51.529
I'm just this fraud,
and this imposter,

39:51.563 --> 39:53.398
and they'll just kick me out.

39:54.567 --> 39:56.634
In a heartbeat.

39:56.668 --> 39:58.636
And who could blame them?

40:01.473 --> 40:04.642
What's going to happen to me?

40:04.677 --> 40:06.712
When Sutton gets back,
Ethan, what happens?

40:11.484 --> 40:12.585
I...

40:14.488 --> 40:16.589
I don't know.

40:20.595 --> 40:22.530
You're Sutton's boyfriend.

40:27.503 --> 40:28.736
I know.

40:38.713 --> 40:41.382
Hey, hon.

40:41.416 --> 40:43.485
How was gal's tennis?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.420
You know? Great.

40:45.455 --> 40:47.522
Oh, that's nice to hear.

40:47.557 --> 40:50.526
That's really nice
to hear. Anything...

40:50.560 --> 40:52.328
interesting come up?

40:53.664 --> 40:55.632
I wasn't going to say anything.

40:55.666 --> 40:58.335
I didn't want to upset you.

40:59.570 --> 41:01.505
What do you mean?
We're a team, hon.

41:04.609 --> 41:07.478
I think it's wrapped up
in that dream, but...

41:07.512 --> 41:11.382
she seems to think her birth mom
might have died in a fire.

41:13.518 --> 41:15.686
Huh.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.656
Well, I'm sure it will pass.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.691
Yeah.

41:20.726 --> 41:22.493
Oh, I almost forgot.

41:22.528 --> 41:24.596
A patient called for you.
Sutton took the message.

41:24.630 --> 41:26.698
Mmm.

41:26.732 --> 41:28.600
Never give out
the home number.

41:28.635 --> 41:30.502
Never give out the home number.

41:30.537 --> 41:32.438
Never give out
the home number, huh?

41:35.743 --> 41:38.545
You know what?

41:40.582 --> 41:42.750
I gotta swing by the office
to get this guy's test results.

41:44.486 --> 41:45.552
TED:
<i>Laurel didn't steal</i>

41:45.586 --> 41:47.487
that laptop, no way.

41:47.521 --> 41:49.356
Highest honors Laurel?
Doesn't make any sense.

41:49.391 --> 41:51.458
And that whole confession
was rehearsed.

41:51.493 --> 41:53.460
Didn't feel right.

41:53.494 --> 41:55.362
What are you,
a detective now?

41:55.397 --> 41:57.498
Lay off
the <i>Law & Order</i> reruns,

41:57.533 --> 41:59.400
stick to rhinoplasty, Ted.

41:59.434 --> 42:00.569
You think this is funny?

42:00.603 --> 42:02.504
I think you need
to calm down.

42:02.538 --> 42:04.506
This whole thing could come
crashing down at any minute.

42:04.540 --> 42:06.341
Which is why you need
to keep it together, okay?

42:06.376 --> 42:08.577
For the both of us. Okay?

42:10.714 --> 42:12.515
Ted, you know how this works.

42:12.549 --> 42:14.517
Yeah.

42:14.551 --> 42:17.387
If there's dirty work to be
done, you just leave it to me.

42:17.421 --> 42:19.589
Just like in high school.

42:19.623 --> 42:22.425
All right. Okay. Then, I think
you got some work to do.

42:25.662 --> 42:38.138
Annie. Annie Hobbs.
