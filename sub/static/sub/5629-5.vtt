00:02.569 --> 00:06.760
Milan, ITALY
A YEAR AGO

00:07.717 --> 00:10.065
Hang on, Tadeo, we're almost there.

00:13.203 --> 00:14.969
It's the same killer, isn't it?

00:16.765 --> 00:18.825
I'm going to die like the others.

00:18.835 --> 00:20.713
Not if I can help it.

00:21.651 --> 00:25.014
- Marco...
- Just stay calm, we're close.

00:29.861 --> 00:31.255
Marco...

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:46.616 --> 00:48.087
Where's the damn bomb squad?

00:48.119 --> 00:50.419
- Seven minutes away.
- We don't have seven minutes!

00:50.507 --> 00:51.509
We can't go in without them.

00:51.516 --> 00:53.984
We got no protection gear, no equipment!

00:54.442 --> 00:56.080
We can't just let him die.

00:56.762 --> 00:58.040
Marco!

00:58.464 --> 00:59.620
Damn it.

01:00.824 --> 01:02.226
Tadeo!

01:07.468 --> 01:10.447
- Tadeo?
- Good to see you again, Marco.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.151
Oh, is that a new jacket?

01:13.790 --> 01:15.706
It's Ridderhoff.

01:23.904 --> 01:25.894
He rigged it with a signal booster.

01:26.014 --> 01:29.068
The range for those things
is only around 500 meters.

01:29.108 --> 01:30.931
Go check outside.

01:34.851 --> 01:38.720
You're almost two minutes
faster this time. I'm impressed.

01:39.612 --> 01:41.324
Think you'll save this one?

01:41.583 --> 01:44.583
Maybe I'm making this too difficult.

01:44.596 --> 01:47.097
Next time I'll go easier on you.

01:47.098 --> 01:49.550
There won't be a next time!

01:55.390 --> 01:56.944
Tadeo!

02:06.762 --> 02:08.140
Tadeo!

02:14.066 --> 02:15.266
OK.

02:15.778 --> 02:17.799
OK, let's figure this out.

02:24.998 --> 02:26.288
Freeze!

02:31.367 --> 02:33.049
Get out of the car!

02:38.033 --> 02:39.675
Out of the car,

02:39.735 --> 02:41.013
now!

02:55.353 --> 02:56.830
How much time is left?

02:57.554 --> 03:00.142
_

03:01.550 --> 03:02.750
No.

03:02.888 --> 03:05.387
Please, no, no!

03:07.781 --> 03:08.993
No.

03:10.178 --> 03:12.058
- No.
- He was in a car.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.259
He took off.

03:14.642 --> 03:18.042
- Marco, we have to go.
- I'm so sorry, Tadeo.

03:18.304 --> 03:21.349
Is there anyone I can pass a message to?

03:21.395 --> 03:23.592
- Your father? Wh...
- Yeah.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.156
Tell him that I love him.

03:25.183 --> 03:26.460
My mother too.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.711
I don't want this to ruin their lives.

03:28.725 --> 03:29.870
I want them to

03:29.890 --> 03:31.936
go on somehow and be happy.

03:32.578 --> 03:34.464
Make sure you get the guy.

03:34.584 --> 03:37.574
- Don't let this happen to anyone else!
- You've got my promise.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.448
He won't hurt anybody ever again, OK?

03:40.449 --> 03:41.789
Marco, come on!

03:44.863 --> 03:46.245
Go, it's OK.

03:46.936 --> 03:48.136
Go.

03:48.757 --> 03:50.101
_

03:51.557 --> 03:52.788
Marco!

03:56.032 --> 03:57.232
_

03:57.787 --> 03:58.987
_

04:09.820 --> 04:12.403
One misfiled piece of evidence

04:12.501 --> 04:14.634
and a guilty man walks free.

04:14.839 --> 04:19.132
We at Victims' Justice League will not
sleep until this travesty's set right.

04:19.374 --> 04:22.267
Julian Ridderhoff will be
held accountable for his crime.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.393
- And that's a promise.
- Ms. Hammond...?

04:28.459 --> 04:31.189
I'm just so glad I had the chance

04:31.190 --> 04:33.901
to prove my innocence in court,

04:33.941 --> 04:35.431
for all to see.

04:35.551 --> 04:37.709
Now, I sincerely hope the police

04:37.723 --> 04:41.297
will spend their efforts
tracking down the real killer.

04:41.298 --> 04:42.508
Thank you.

04:42.509 --> 04:43.709
Thank you.

The Hague
NOW

06:10.454 --> 06:13.287
- A playing card?
- On my wind-shield, this morning,

06:13.288 --> 06:15.564
Julian fucking Ridderhoff.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.940
Ridderhoff?

06:16.961 --> 06:18.741
- He's in Italy.
- No!

06:18.772 --> 06:20.820
He moved here, two
months ago, to Valkenburg.

06:20.851 --> 06:23.608
- That's only thirty minutes from here.
- He's following me.

06:24.147 --> 06:25.405
How do you know where he lives?

06:25.406 --> 06:27.337
Well, I never stopped tracking him.

06:28.102 --> 06:31.264
- I'm aware of how that sounds.
- I'm glad you're aware.

06:31.852 --> 06:33.708
What is this, Marco?

06:33.710 --> 06:35.119
- Cat and mouse?
- Yeah, yeah!

06:35.129 --> 06:36.506
That's exactly what it is.

06:36.527 --> 06:39.102
Only he thinks he's the
cat, and I'm the mouse.

06:40.264 --> 06:41.627
When he was in his early twenties,

06:41.628 --> 06:43.916
he applied to the police academy in Geneva.

06:43.933 --> 06:46.803
They gave him a psychological
evaluation. You know what it showed?

06:46.814 --> 06:48.370
From what you've told me,

06:48.371 --> 06:50.638
psychopathic personality, with

06:50.654 --> 06:52.494
an intense need for power,

06:52.496 --> 06:54.457
- and control.
- And he also had high scores

06:54.467 --> 06:57.519
for narcissism, and pathological
contempt for authority.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.304
Pathological contempt for
authority, that's where you fit in.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.004
Ever since his case was dismissed,
he thinks he's untouchable.

07:03.015 --> 07:04.757
If his case was dismissed,

07:04.773 --> 07:06.086
he is untouchable.

07:06.102 --> 07:08.438
He killed three people on my watch!

07:08.455 --> 07:10.669
I'm not about to let him make it four!

07:13.004 --> 07:14.572
- Morning.
- Morning.

07:19.234 --> 07:21.314
- Marco?
- Yeah.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.307
- You have a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

07:27.262 --> 07:30.387
I told you I'd keep looking for
something more about your sister, but,

07:30.507 --> 07:32.079
I've hit a brick wall.

07:33.383 --> 07:35.455
Wh... wh... what about those kidnappers

07:35.456 --> 07:37.126
you identified in
Hungary, the ones who used

07:37.141 --> 07:38.720
the medallion for membership?

07:38.948 --> 07:40.484
They've scattered all over Europe.

07:40.485 --> 07:42.780
Well, there must be arrest records
for the members of the gang.

07:42.861 --> 07:44.610
We're talking over thirty years ago.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.448
Records back then were written
by hand or on a typewriter.

07:47.879 --> 07:50.628
Some were never digitized,
others were destroyed or lost.

07:50.649 --> 07:53.419
OK, I need the name of the
lead detective from 1989.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.620
He's dead.

07:55.956 --> 07:58.853
And everyone else has
retired, or moved on...

07:59.260 --> 08:01.707
Look, I know this doesn't feel good, but

08:01.718 --> 08:03.005
I can't lie to you.

08:03.497 --> 08:04.774
There's nothing.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.124
No, no, no, no! I...

08:06.141 --> 08:07.997
I refuse to accept that.

08:15.499 --> 08:17.633
Better make that coffee to go.

08:18.242 --> 08:19.397
A bomb.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.901
Holmens Canal. One dead.

08:20.912 --> 08:21.828
Terrorist attack?

08:21.849 --> 08:23.677
They don't know for sure.
They're asking for our assistance.

08:23.687 --> 08:25.679
All right, coffee here is wretched anyway.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.214
ID was still in his trousers pocket.

09:00.219 --> 09:02.656
Richard Demcott, 22 years old.

09:03.031 --> 09:05.123
Upper torso was blown to pieces.

09:05.134 --> 09:07.248
We haven't found all
the parts. It's barbaric.

09:07.253 --> 09:08.836
What kind of bomb are we dealing with?

09:08.844 --> 09:11.677
It's hard to say, since most
of it ended up underwater.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.565
Well, the bomb was placed some way here.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.769
So, are we saying that

09:17.889 --> 09:20.768
Demcott just happened to be
walking by at the wrong time?

09:20.775 --> 09:22.209
Not necessarily.

09:22.524 --> 09:25.985
Based on the powder burns
around the wounds, I suspect

09:25.986 --> 09:28.039
the device could have been on his person.

09:28.159 --> 09:29.985
As in, he was carrying the bomb?

09:30.025 --> 09:32.828
Either that, or, some kind of suicide vest,

09:32.849 --> 09:35.547
accidentally detonated
before he reached his target.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.313
This is a residential area.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.862
There are no government
buildings, no embassies, no crowds.

09:41.085 --> 09:43.124
What exactly was he trying to blow up?

09:43.125 --> 09:44.761
Well, that's your department, Inspector.

09:44.771 --> 09:46.244
I just deal with the dead.

09:46.312 --> 09:49.220
But I suspect you'll have more
answers once they dredge the canal.

09:49.241 --> 09:51.111
OK. Thank you.

09:53.097 --> 09:55.660
Medical examiner thinks
it could be some kind of

09:55.661 --> 09:57.753
suicide bomb gone awry.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.992
Sounds ominous.

09:59.112 --> 10:00.316
Any witnesses?

10:00.353 --> 10:03.480
Uniforms spoke to a pretzel
vendor. He works the bridge.

10:03.497 --> 10:04.925
He didn't see anything suspicious,

10:04.932 --> 10:07.182
dog-walkers, joggers, nothing usual.

10:07.186 --> 10:09.342
But there must be some
security cameras around here.

10:10.079 --> 10:12.317
Well, the system's being upgraded.

10:12.337 --> 10:15.040
Park supervisor said that the
cameras have been offline all week.

10:15.206 --> 10:17.580
So, we have no idea where he came from,

10:17.581 --> 10:18.781
or what he was doing.

10:18.782 --> 10:19.982
Nope.

10:20.749 --> 10:23.571
God, don't you just love it when
it all comes together like this?

10:24.488 --> 10:28.564
COD is blast injury resulting
in a severed spinal cord.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.398
Did you find anything on
the clothes, or the body?

10:31.405 --> 10:33.639
No foreign hairs, no fibres, but,

10:33.662 --> 10:36.044
I did find this, wedged into a shoe.

10:36.068 --> 10:37.821
I've no idea of the significance.

10:38.175 --> 10:39.578
It's a playing card.

10:39.896 --> 10:41.569
Julian Ridderhoff.

10:50.141 --> 10:51.681
A playing card.

10:52.130 --> 10:53.387
Not even

10:53.393 --> 10:57.326
Judge Magrudov would grant an
arrest warrant on a playing card.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.618
- Anyone could have put that there.
- It's not just

11:00.657 --> 11:02.999
the playing card. It's the
way this man was killed.

11:03.017 --> 11:05.333
I didn't know, they've
confirmed it was a collar bomb?

11:05.365 --> 11:06.747
They're still dredging the canal.

11:06.762 --> 11:09.075
But we know it was some
kind of an explosive device.

11:09.121 --> 11:10.324
Costante...

11:10.422 --> 11:12.922
Let them finish their investigation.

11:12.948 --> 11:14.751
It can take hours, maybe even days.

11:14.766 --> 11:17.301
And if they discover it
was not a collar bomb?

11:17.421 --> 11:20.228
Already Ridderhoff is suing
your department in Italy

11:20.231 --> 11:22.371
for wrongful arrest and incarceration.

11:22.393 --> 11:24.867
I'm telling you... I'm telling you, I...

11:25.514 --> 11:26.756
I know it was him.

11:26.821 --> 11:28.577
If we don't pick him up now

11:28.578 --> 11:31.641
- he may end up killing someone else!
- I know you know,

11:31.957 --> 11:34.446
and I know your instincts are extraordinary

11:34.461 --> 11:36.213
but they're not infallible.

11:36.576 --> 11:39.131
Your emotions are too
heavily invested in this.

11:39.151 --> 11:41.155
And that clouds judgement.

11:43.922 --> 11:45.128
The kid,

11:45.335 --> 11:46.891
he killed last year in Milan,

11:46.892 --> 11:48.092
Tadeo,

11:48.455 --> 11:51.075
his dad was a cop. A friend of mine.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.816
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

11:54.982 --> 11:56.324
Step back.

11:56.754 --> 11:58.865
Follow judicial procedure.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.903
Mount a case against your Mr. Ridderhoff,

12:02.106 --> 12:04.293
and when you have sufficient evidence,

12:04.615 --> 12:06.761
you convict the son of a bitch!

12:07.531 --> 12:08.731
Yes?

12:20.049 --> 12:21.249
Marco?

12:21.250 --> 12:22.451
What's going on?

12:22.495 --> 12:23.695
Nothing.

12:24.167 --> 12:25.450
That's the problem.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.628
Ridderhoff, open up!

12:47.148 --> 12:48.711
It's Marco Costante.

14:11.428 --> 14:12.628
Don't worry,

14:12.718 --> 14:13.918
he's not here.

14:13.969 --> 14:15.691
That's not what I'm worried about.

14:15.696 --> 14:16.943
Did you follow me here?

14:17.063 --> 14:18.852
Are you saying I shouldn't have?

14:18.972 --> 14:20.436
How did you gain entry?

14:20.493 --> 14:21.693
The door was unlocked.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.042
You're trespassing, Marco.

14:23.057 --> 14:25.238
Trespassing? He just
blew a man to smithereens.

14:25.248 --> 14:27.485
And if we can prove
that, he will be punished.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.140
- Oh, come on!
- Hey!

14:30.762 --> 14:32.019
I'm not done.

14:33.009 --> 14:35.104
I know you have a history with this guy.

14:35.366 --> 14:37.365
But if you want to play vigilante,

14:37.564 --> 14:39.760
there is no room for you on this team.

14:42.357 --> 14:43.826
It's your choice.

14:45.857 --> 14:48.468
I'm leaving. I expect you to do the same.

14:56.085 --> 14:57.297
Arabela?

14:57.574 --> 14:58.784
- What's up?
- They just pulled

14:58.785 --> 15:01.354
what looks like part of a
bomb collar out of the canal.

15:01.355 --> 15:02.500
- Shit.
- Yeah,

15:02.515 --> 15:03.999
it's being rushed to the lab now,

15:04.024 --> 15:06.574
but it definitely seems
like Ridderhoff's M.O.

15:06.963 --> 15:08.401
Keep me posted.

15:08.465 --> 15:10.059
_

15:14.183 --> 15:17.172
I heard they found part of
the bomb collar in the canal.

15:17.369 --> 15:19.706
Dorn's issued an arrest
warrant for Ridderhoff.

15:20.559 --> 15:22.180
I hope you don't feel vindicated

15:22.195 --> 15:24.638
because that little stunt you
pulled could let him walk again.

15:42.393 --> 15:45.003
I let my emotions get
the better of me today.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.351
Is this your way of apologizing?

15:47.371 --> 15:48.987
I can make it formal if you want.

15:48.997 --> 15:50.759
I want it to never happen again.

15:52.071 --> 15:53.271
It won't.

16:01.839 --> 16:03.848
What does that look like exactly?

16:06.288 --> 16:07.488
What?

16:08.046 --> 16:10.343
A formal apology.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.720
Do you...

16:12.206 --> 16:14.695
get down on your knees, or, what?

16:19.906 --> 16:21.106
Another dead body.

16:21.107 --> 16:22.748
Male, thirties, bomb.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.197
- Where?
- Valkenburg Park.

16:25.239 --> 16:27.842
That's two kilometres
from Ridderhoff's house.

16:30.396 --> 16:31.596
Any ID?

16:31.654 --> 16:33.447
Lab's running his prints now.

16:33.511 --> 16:35.833
Luckily one of the fingers was left intact.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.656
As with the last case,

16:37.661 --> 16:39.539
there was massive bodily trauma.

16:39.584 --> 16:41.911
I put time of death at 5 pm.

16:41.921 --> 16:43.537
OK, did you find the card?

16:43.897 --> 16:45.097
Card?

16:45.157 --> 16:47.752
The playing card, like...
like the last victim.

16:47.838 --> 16:49.637
No, I didn't find any card.

16:51.073 --> 16:52.628
If this is a copycat,

16:52.638 --> 16:54.455
they may not know about the playing card.

16:54.465 --> 16:56.884
No, I'm telling you, Ridderhoff did this.

16:56.904 --> 16:58.306
Fingerprints results.

16:58.762 --> 17:00.981
Fortunately, our victim
here was in the system.

17:00.982 --> 17:03.319
- Or we would have had to wait for DNA...
- OK, just cut to the chase!

17:03.320 --> 17:04.567
Who the hell is it?

17:04.713 --> 17:06.152
Julian Ridderhoff.

17:16.472 --> 17:18.339
Signs of forced entry.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.455
The killer came in through here.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.711
And dragged Ridderhoff out the same way.

17:29.895 --> 17:32.414
So, he was sitting, having a cup of coffee,

17:32.793 --> 17:35.201
and disappeared without
any sign of struggle.

17:36.002 --> 17:37.945
The killer could have had a weapon.

17:42.465 --> 17:44.657
The guy has got more
unpaid bills than I do.

17:45.114 --> 17:46.843
Now he doesn't have to pay for any of them.

17:46.844 --> 17:48.461
Have you ever heard of
an organization called

17:48.469 --> 17:50.161
the Victims' Justice League?

17:50.347 --> 17:53.077
Uh, yes. I was reading about them in

17:53.078 --> 17:55.142
one of Marco's old case files.

17:55.163 --> 17:57.258
- In what context?
- Uh, I think they were involved

17:57.263 --> 17:58.545
in Ridderhoff's trial.

17:58.550 --> 18:00.862
Victims' statement support or something.

18:03.881 --> 18:05.081
Oh.

18:05.564 --> 18:07.463
Think I found our weapon.

18:07.942 --> 18:09.391
Part of it anyway.

18:11.706 --> 18:13.168
- Chloroform.
- That explains why

18:13.169 --> 18:14.583
there wasn't any struggle.

18:14.584 --> 18:17.445
Why were you asking about the
Victims' Justice League anyway?

18:17.446 --> 18:20.551
Because Ridderhoff filed a
lawsuit against them last week.

18:20.606 --> 18:21.808
What for?

18:23.150 --> 18:24.488
Harassment.

18:24.751 --> 18:28.017
The organization's run by a
woman named Olivia Hammond.

18:28.028 --> 18:29.239
She was at the court

18:29.240 --> 18:31.677
- when Ridderhoff was released.
- Well, she's a bit of a crusader,

18:31.678 --> 18:34.056
her daughter was raped
and murdered ten years ago.

18:34.062 --> 18:35.616
They never found the perpetrator.

18:35.617 --> 18:39.086
Hammond's got a team of volunteers,
who investigate old murder cases.

18:39.342 --> 18:41.332
They've actually helped
launch a few re-trials

18:41.337 --> 18:42.780
by bringing old evidence to light.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.784
Well, sounds like a good cause.

18:44.815 --> 18:46.347
Where's the harassment come in?

18:46.348 --> 18:47.857
See for yourself.

18:49.369 --> 18:52.395
This is the latest newsletter.

18:52.396 --> 18:53.543
_

18:53.544 --> 18:55.419
_

18:55.695 --> 18:56.895
Whoa.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.809
It looks like she's targeting these people.

18:59.824 --> 19:02.374
Yeah, they were all
suspected of murder, but,

19:02.399 --> 19:04.695
none of them were ever actually prosecuted.

19:04.732 --> 19:06.549
Or they were tried and got off.

19:06.669 --> 19:08.407
One down, nine to go.

19:08.422 --> 19:11.169
OK, I want you to get me
the names and addresses

19:11.170 --> 19:13.087
of everyone on this list.

19:13.158 --> 19:15.585
We have to send you two out more often.

19:15.949 --> 19:17.291
That would be nice.

19:17.887 --> 19:19.866
But, hey, who's complaining?

19:22.406 --> 19:24.554
The list is figurative in intention.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.069
The League's mission is to keep
these murderers in the public eye.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.595
You mean suspects, Miss Hammond?

19:32.695 --> 19:35.063
Suspects who have eluded justice.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.642
Ridderhoff responded to, uh,

19:37.667 --> 19:40.509
being kept in the public
eye, by filing this

19:40.539 --> 19:42.271
harassment lawsuit against you.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.037
Sometimes the law fails the victims.

19:45.325 --> 19:47.854
- We give the law a push.
- You won't have to anymore.

19:48.001 --> 19:49.248
Yes, I heard.

19:49.453 --> 19:50.937
That doesn't bother you.

19:52.334 --> 19:53.908
I deplore any murder.

19:55.413 --> 19:56.761
But to be honest,

19:56.832 --> 19:59.260
this one is no great
loss to the world, is it?

20:00.118 --> 20:01.318
Hm.

20:05.556 --> 20:06.868
Inspector,

20:09.192 --> 20:10.838
I'm not a vigilante.

20:11.266 --> 20:14.265
I want them to go down in court, fairly.

20:14.321 --> 20:17.032
And I want to see their
faces when it happens.

20:17.204 --> 20:21.070
Where where you between 3
and 5 yesterday afternoon?

20:23.291 --> 20:24.497
In the dentist's chair,

20:24.532 --> 20:26.294
having a crown replaced.

20:27.054 --> 20:29.105
It should be easy enough to verify.

20:30.651 --> 20:32.665
I've got a speaking
engagement in about an hour,

20:32.680 --> 20:34.018
will there be anything else?

20:35.116 --> 20:36.666
We'll see you out.

20:38.811 --> 20:41.173
I'm sure we have other
cases you could be pursuing.

20:41.184 --> 20:42.860
What's your point, Miss Hammond?

20:45.697 --> 20:48.150
Did you think about the victims' families?

20:48.470 --> 20:49.843
How will it look:

20:49.963 --> 20:52.719
you couldn't put Ridderhoff
away, but you catch his killer?

21:06.995 --> 21:09.783
_

21:15.365 --> 21:16.860
You don't sleep?

21:17.781 --> 21:19.023
Look who's talking.

21:20.783 --> 21:22.979
Makes for a pretty compelling reading, uh?

21:24.264 --> 21:25.686
Do you think she's guilty?

21:26.858 --> 21:29.171
She's got a lot of pain and anger.

21:30.918 --> 21:33.478
You need an outlet for
that, believe me I know.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.800
So do I.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.688
I was raped.

21:39.714 --> 21:41.867
At knife-point, when I was 17.

21:47.394 --> 21:48.959
Did they catch the guy?

21:50.853 --> 21:52.053
No.

21:55.537 --> 21:57.365
- I'm sorry. I...
- Marco,

21:57.471 --> 22:00.471
I didn't tell you this to get
your pity or your compassion.

22:00.488 --> 22:02.221
What happened, happened.

22:02.541 --> 22:05.354
I dealt with the rage
and pain a long time ago,

22:05.366 --> 22:07.156
I don't let it define me.

22:09.650 --> 22:12.359
Well, it turns out you're even
more impressive than I thought.

22:13.758 --> 22:15.364
You deal with your past...

22:16.601 --> 22:18.269
or you get trapped by it.

22:33.498 --> 22:35.856
Forensics found fragments of the bomb timer

22:35.866 --> 22:37.874
wedged under the stairs by the canal.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.205
Ridderhoff's DNA was all over it.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.996
He definitely killed that boy.

22:43.454 --> 22:45.441
Marco called it from the start.

22:45.485 --> 22:47.824
He must be dancing a jig.

22:47.892 --> 22:49.477
He's not the dancing type.

22:57.519 --> 22:59.053
Rough morning, sir?

22:59.088 --> 23:02.217
Erik didn't want to go to school
this morning, put up a real fight.

23:02.338 --> 23:04.095
Thought you only had him at weekends.

23:04.119 --> 23:06.901
His mother's at a conference
in Copenhagen all week.

23:06.902 --> 23:09.796
And on top of that, there's some bully
at school who's been threatening him.

23:09.797 --> 23:11.913
I could teach him some
MMA moves if you like.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.613
Kids love that "crouching tiger" stuff.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.622
Thanks, I can handle it.

23:18.407 --> 23:19.948
Don't bother taking off your coats,

23:19.949 --> 23:21.961
the police in Amsterdam
called in a strangulation.

23:21.962 --> 23:23.705
And they need our help because?

23:23.725 --> 23:26.126
The victim's name is Nicolas
Halle, sound familiar?

23:26.131 --> 23:27.784
He's on the League's hit list.

23:28.469 --> 23:30.733
- Holy shit.
- Yeah. Go.

23:35.941 --> 23:38.454
AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands.

23:39.855 --> 23:41.055
OK, hold on.

23:49.814 --> 23:51.487
Wow. That's rank.

23:52.528 --> 23:54.627
They have masks there if you need them.

23:54.628 --> 23:55.828
I'm good.

24:01.130 --> 24:03.114
Victim is Nicolas Halle.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.868
Forty-two years of age.

24:04.906 --> 24:06.957
Uh, how long he's been here?

24:06.972 --> 24:09.193
Hm, two weeks, maybe more.

24:09.231 --> 24:10.602
Lived alone, no job.

24:10.722 --> 24:12.650
Neighbours finally called about the smell.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.198
Thought it was a dead animal.

24:14.199 --> 24:15.399
And, ah...

24:15.492 --> 24:18.280
no one remembers hearing
anything, any signs of a struggle?

24:18.281 --> 24:20.177
We're going to speak to the neighbours now.

24:20.197 --> 24:23.193
Let me know if you have any more questions.

24:27.354 --> 24:29.180
So how did he get on a hit list.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.071
They say he murdered a girl in France.

24:32.578 --> 24:35.113
L'assassin de Joelle Giroux.

24:35.119 --> 24:37.553
- You speak French.
- Mais oui.

24:37.589 --> 24:38.983
Why did I even ask?

24:38.998 --> 24:41.928
Alsace, France, two months ago.

24:41.964 --> 24:44.743
Halle was the prime
suspect of Giroux's murder.

24:44.779 --> 24:46.295
They questioned him more than once,

24:46.301 --> 24:48.173
but they didn't have enough to charge him.

24:48.221 --> 24:51.788
So, he was tried in the court
of public opinion instead.

24:56.026 --> 24:58.938
This is the photo from
Giroux's crime scene.

25:06.893 --> 25:08.175
Bloody hell.

25:09.377 --> 25:12.258
Halle has been killed in exactly
the same way that she was.

25:14.534 --> 25:16.877
Someone's hunting murder suspects.

25:18.048 --> 25:20.287
So, this guy's killing murderers, uh?

25:20.311 --> 25:21.735
It's just what we need.

25:21.752 --> 25:23.991
Some nut job who thinks he's Batman.

25:24.033 --> 25:25.817
Suspect, Berger.

25:26.110 --> 25:28.411
You all need to remember that.

25:29.509 --> 25:31.722
- What do you have?
- Well,

25:32.649 --> 25:36.070
the, ah, Demcott/Ridderhoff

25:36.416 --> 25:39.264
bomb collars, the same
size, same materials,

25:39.266 --> 25:42.024
both victims blown up in a public place.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.972
And the Giroux/Halle murders,

25:45.993 --> 25:50.507
same make of belt, same X
on the forehead, same pose,

25:50.517 --> 25:53.369
both suspects found
strangled in their apartments.

25:53.370 --> 25:55.711
The suspects are being
killed in the exact same way

25:55.712 --> 25:57.278
as the murders they were accused of.

25:57.295 --> 25:59.172
Only someone with access to police files

25:59.173 --> 26:02.084
would be able to reproduce
this stuff so precisely.

26:02.104 --> 26:04.213
But why would someone take the time

26:04.236 --> 26:05.991
to go into such detail?

26:06.729 --> 26:08.112
And how would they know?

26:08.129 --> 26:10.481
- Do you have your profile, Ellie?
- Yes.

26:11.515 --> 26:14.186
I think this person doesn't
enjoy what they're doing,

26:14.197 --> 26:15.692
they see it as a duty.

26:16.061 --> 26:17.596
That's one way of putting it.

26:17.597 --> 26:19.192
Well, it's an eye for an eye.

26:19.216 --> 26:22.773
It's more than just a simple
execution, it's personal.

26:22.779 --> 26:25.107
This person's lost someone
close to them, like the killer.

26:25.118 --> 26:27.670
It's the kind of pain that's
been festering for years.

26:27.790 --> 26:29.065
They're not gonna stop.

26:29.082 --> 26:30.718
Well, no pressure then.

26:31.899 --> 26:35.101
Nicolas Halle and Julian
Ridderhoff are both

26:35.118 --> 26:36.566
on this list.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.844
If we're working on the supposition
they were killed by the same person,

26:39.849 --> 26:41.856
then our next victim is also

26:41.923 --> 26:45.308
- on this list.
- All these murders were local.

26:45.337 --> 26:48.722
So, there's a good possibility the
killer is still in the vicinity.

26:48.731 --> 26:51.100
Divide the list
alphabetically by last name,

26:51.112 --> 26:54.048
look to see if there's any suspect
within a hundred kilometres radius,

26:54.066 --> 26:55.554
verify they're still alive,

26:55.590 --> 26:57.143
get them police protection.

26:57.628 --> 27:00.121
Marco, you and I will go have
another chat with Miss Hammond.

27:00.135 --> 27:02.633
No, I would like to speak with her myself.

27:02.909 --> 27:04.454
I'll send her to your office.

27:08.095 --> 27:09.621
Yes, yes, I totally understand,

27:09.626 --> 27:11.592
but there must be something you can do.

27:13.643 --> 27:16.021
Of course I've talked to
him, and no I can't do that,

27:16.025 --> 27:17.401
I do have a job you know.

27:18.134 --> 27:19.585
She's out of town.

27:21.512 --> 27:22.859
What do I expect? I expect you

27:22.864 --> 27:25.010
to talk to the parents
of that boy for instance.

27:28.176 --> 27:29.100
You know what, Miss Hall,

27:29.101 --> 27:30.930
that's not exactly the
help I've been looking for.

27:31.428 --> 27:33.597
In fact, it's no help at all. Thank you.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.521
Do you mind?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.065
Go ahead.

27:42.233 --> 27:43.436
How's it going?

27:43.484 --> 27:45.039
Still going through the list.

27:45.043 --> 27:47.435
Calling local police to request protection,

27:47.439 --> 27:49.741
but their response is
less than enthusiastic.

27:50.355 --> 27:51.560
Everything all right?

27:53.609 --> 27:55.750
That bully hit him again in school.

27:56.754 --> 27:58.073
It's tough.

27:58.253 --> 27:59.996
I asked the teacher to talk to the parents

27:59.997 --> 28:02.175
but she won't do it. Can you believe that?

28:02.209 --> 28:04.870
Well, she's not his
father, Sebastian, you are.

28:06.506 --> 28:07.706
What's that supposed to mean?

28:07.707 --> 28:09.588
If you want your boy to
stick out for himself,

28:10.014 --> 28:12.103
maybe you're the one that
needs to get more involved.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.959
ROTTERDAM, The Netherlands

28:27.701 --> 28:29.289
Ferenc Nocek?

28:29.506 --> 28:31.124
It's the ICC.

28:31.256 --> 28:32.456
You there?

28:33.012 --> 28:34.215
Go away!

28:34.312 --> 28:35.687
Leave us alone.

28:35.991 --> 28:37.834
We need to speak with your husband.

28:37.835 --> 28:39.095
He's not home.

28:39.964 --> 28:42.150
Please, it's important.

28:42.151 --> 28:43.377
What do you want?

28:45.222 --> 28:46.581
Can we come inside?

28:49.634 --> 28:51.415
Olivia, is het over?

28:56.809 --> 28:58.208
Ferenc is innocent.

29:00.295 --> 29:02.218
He worked with Greta.

29:02.589 --> 29:05.482
The girl who was murdered at
that restaurant in Hamburg.

29:05.935 --> 29:07.135
They were friends.

29:07.364 --> 29:10.108
Well, friends kill friends
all the time, Mrs. Nocek.

29:10.770 --> 29:12.967
How did your husband become a suspect?

29:13.397 --> 29:15.245
They were finished for the night,

29:15.751 --> 29:17.254
all the diners had gone,

29:17.990 --> 29:20.264
Ferenc had cleaned the kitchen, and,

29:20.277 --> 29:23.023
Greta said she was going to
stay to total up the receipts.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.438
So, he was the last one to see her alive.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.771
According to the police,

29:26.772 --> 29:27.972
yes.

29:28.274 --> 29:31.214
But they didn't even look at anyone else.

29:31.215 --> 29:33.716
His photo was plastered everywhere.

29:33.852 --> 29:37.269
And then the Victims'
Justice League put his name in

29:37.283 --> 29:38.810
their newsletter, and

29:38.890 --> 29:40.847
it's been a living hell ever since.

29:40.848 --> 29:42.147
Mrs. Nocek,

29:42.189 --> 29:44.420
we're not here about your husband's case.

29:44.977 --> 29:48.480
We're here because we have reason to
believe that his life might be in danger.

29:49.652 --> 29:51.193
I don't understand.

29:55.164 --> 29:56.671
A vigilante

29:57.202 --> 29:59.869
is killing murder suspects.

30:00.122 --> 30:01.322
What?

30:01.323 --> 30:02.901
Do you know where we might find him?

30:04.313 --> 30:06.488
I don't know. Um...

30:08.899 --> 30:11.030
He was supposed to be
home about an hour ago.

30:11.031 --> 30:13.149
_

30:13.150 --> 30:15.794
_

30:18.979 --> 30:21.410
Carine, I just got off
the phone with Arabela.

30:21.411 --> 30:23.913
Another one of the suspects from
the hit list has gone missing.

30:23.932 --> 30:25.969
- Which one?
- A Ferenc Nocek,

30:25.988 --> 30:27.665
he was meant to be home over an hour ago,

30:27.666 --> 30:29.896
he's not answering his
phone, his wife is frantic.

30:29.897 --> 30:32.177
He was accused of raping
an 18-year-old girl,

30:32.178 --> 30:34.967
by locking in a restaurant
freezer leaving her to die.

30:34.968 --> 30:37.552
Yeah. Greta Hendrix,
Hamburg, two years ago.

30:37.672 --> 30:39.962
OK. Go see the medical examiner.

30:39.971 --> 30:43.015
Have him look over the autopsy
report of our previous victims.

30:43.024 --> 30:45.246
We need to find a link
between those victims

30:45.264 --> 30:46.767
and our copycat killer.

30:46.768 --> 30:47.968
Look for

30:48.006 --> 30:51.094
- a fingerprint, an eyelash, anything.
- OK.

30:58.452 --> 30:59.652
Ms. Hammond.

30:59.781 --> 31:02.638
Michel Dorn. Thank you
for coming to see me.

31:02.639 --> 31:03.839
Why don't we sit?

31:08.267 --> 31:09.481
Mr. Dorn,

31:09.670 --> 31:11.407
I'm familiar with your work.

31:12.039 --> 31:13.433
It's a pleasure to meet you.

31:13.695 --> 31:15.557
As it is for me to meet you.

31:16.501 --> 31:18.670
We have much in common you and I.

31:19.497 --> 31:21.742
When I made the decision to

31:21.955 --> 31:23.657
prosecute war criminals,

31:24.044 --> 31:27.494
they said, and many of those
people were my friends, they said

31:27.783 --> 31:30.944
"Why bother, it was so long ago.

31:31.177 --> 31:33.498
We're just harmless old men now."

31:33.499 --> 31:34.699
For them,

31:34.703 --> 31:38.195
time had diminish the
horror of what had been done.

31:38.910 --> 31:40.162
But not for you.

31:40.163 --> 31:41.363
No.

31:41.787 --> 31:43.427
No, not for me.

31:43.498 --> 31:46.830
The crimes against
humanity that I have seen,

31:47.087 --> 31:49.867
the inconceivable harm
that I have witnessed people

31:49.878 --> 31:51.412
inflicting upon each other,

31:51.430 --> 31:53.204
has filled me with an anger

31:53.474 --> 31:55.768
that would never allow me to forget.

31:56.791 --> 31:57.991
Me neither.

32:00.829 --> 32:02.427
I devoted my life

32:02.446 --> 32:04.686
to seeking justice since my daughter died.

32:06.785 --> 32:08.619
I became aware of our

32:09.224 --> 32:10.679
parallel commitment,

32:10.708 --> 32:13.005
when I researched your organization.

32:13.322 --> 32:16.219
You have more than two thousand members.

32:16.488 --> 32:18.842
Doctors, teachers, lawyers.

32:19.485 --> 32:21.650
Very impressive what you have achieved.

32:22.557 --> 32:24.953
Mr. Dorn, that's not why
you wanted to speak to me.

32:25.521 --> 32:27.360
To tell me you admire my work.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.808
No, no, I did, actually.

32:30.072 --> 32:33.012
I also want to ask you for assistance.

32:33.541 --> 32:36.089
We need access to your membership database.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.125
We adhere to strict journalistic practices.

32:40.640 --> 32:42.459
And you know as well as I do

32:42.478 --> 32:44.085
that information is confidential.

32:45.314 --> 32:48.197
We have a homicidal vigilante in our midst,

32:48.221 --> 32:51.127
someone who believes
that for certain trials,

32:51.247 --> 32:53.082
justice has not been served,

32:53.111 --> 32:55.989
so they have taken it upon themselves,

32:56.354 --> 32:57.843
to be judge,

32:57.945 --> 32:59.145
jury,

32:59.714 --> 33:01.165
and executioner.

33:01.599 --> 33:03.263
The victims of this killer

33:03.305 --> 33:04.756
have all been people

33:04.761 --> 33:06.377
on your Web pages,

33:06.497 --> 33:07.894
in your newsletter.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.766
I'm absolutely confident

33:09.780 --> 33:12.762
that you are operating within
the parameters of the law.

33:12.923 --> 33:14.662
But the evidence suggests

33:14.672 --> 33:16.335
that someone in your ranks

33:17.633 --> 33:18.833
is not.

33:19.515 --> 33:22.360
This is a very clever killer.

33:22.361 --> 33:23.561
This vendetta,

33:24.199 --> 33:26.873
will be extremely difficult to stop.

33:27.292 --> 33:28.492
Please.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.863
Could you help us?

33:31.756 --> 33:34.729
I'm triangulating the
GPS on Nocek's mobile.

33:35.836 --> 33:37.036
Come on.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.484
It's technology, Marco, not magic.

33:40.487 --> 33:41.896
- Sorry.
- No,

33:41.897 --> 33:43.626
I know you're doing
everything that you can.

33:43.746 --> 33:46.734
The signal is pinging off a
tower somewhere in Rotterdam.

33:46.747 --> 33:49.362
See if there are any restaurants,
or catering companies around there.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.220
Anything that would have
an industrial freezer.

33:51.239 --> 33:54.434
This is an industrial area near the A15.

33:54.435 --> 33:56.506
Not exactly hopping with life.

33:57.902 --> 33:59.840
What about a... a processing plant,

33:59.854 --> 34:01.620
a... a slaughterhouse?

34:04.099 --> 34:05.337
Nothing.

34:07.769 --> 34:08.969
Wait.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.656
There's a cold storage warehouse.

34:12.065 --> 34:15.072
Bergen Storage is equipped to
handle all temperature ranges.

34:15.090 --> 34:16.458
Frozen, chilled, ambient...

34:16.458 --> 34:17.835
- OK, let's go!
- Yeah.

34:18.348 --> 34:19.945
I'll send you the link.

34:23.458 --> 34:24.658
Berger.

34:26.929 --> 34:28.130
What's this?

34:28.181 --> 34:30.899
It's Olivia Hammond's membership database.

34:31.416 --> 34:32.710
I want you to have a look at it,

34:32.712 --> 34:34.972
and see if any one name stands out.

34:52.871 --> 34:54.279
Back there!

34:54.321 --> 34:55.521
Yes, ma'am.

35:21.196 --> 35:22.686
OK, let's split up.

35:23.589 --> 35:24.795
Yeah.

35:37.227 --> 35:38.776
Help me!

35:47.035 --> 35:49.793
- Help me.
- He's here!

36:09.603 --> 36:12.078
- Is this the autopsy from Amsterdam?
- Oh, yes.

36:12.110 --> 36:13.452
Ah, here.

36:13.987 --> 36:15.853
I'll take a look and send you my report.

36:16.151 --> 36:18.869
- OK?
- Oh, I'm happy to wait.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.460
If you want.

36:28.157 --> 36:29.592
Ah, OK.

36:29.999 --> 36:31.936
OK, you're OK now.

36:32.151 --> 36:33.751
Who did this to you?

36:34.366 --> 36:36.068
I don't... I don't know.

36:36.101 --> 36:39.230
He... he had a mask.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.931
Let's get you some place warm.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.390
No, you... you can't wait up for
me, Erik, I'll probably be awhile.

36:46.592 --> 36:47.802
How long?

36:48.218 --> 36:50.298
I don't know how long, Erik, I'm working.

36:50.312 --> 36:52.951
I need you to help me
with the science project.

36:53.124 --> 36:54.542
Sounds cool. What is it?

36:54.561 --> 36:56.740
A papier mâché windmill.

36:56.806 --> 36:59.013
We're learning about wind energy.

36:59.245 --> 37:01.759
How about we pick up the
supplies tomorrow after school?

37:01.797 --> 37:03.005
Thank you, Dad.

37:03.006 --> 37:04.206
Love you.

37:06.629 --> 37:07.862
I love you too.

37:17.842 --> 37:19.052
How is he?

37:19.453 --> 37:21.027
Hypothermia and shock.

37:21.045 --> 37:23.427
EMT said he only had
another half an hour left.

37:23.437 --> 37:25.308
- Does he know who attacked him?
- No.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.374
He said the guy was wearing a mask.

37:39.218 --> 37:40.712
Are they your children?

37:43.397 --> 37:45.487
No, that's me and my brother.

37:45.701 --> 37:47.725
Oh, wow, you look very similar.

37:47.926 --> 37:50.501
- We were very close.
- Are you still?

37:52.083 --> 37:53.283
He died.

37:54.259 --> 37:56.256
Shortly after that picture was taken.

37:57.650 --> 37:58.896
I'm so sorry.

38:01.116 --> 38:02.540
He was murdered.

38:11.951 --> 38:14.851
_

38:21.954 --> 38:23.584
Sebastian, go ahead.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.865
I'm looking at the Justice
League's mailing list,

38:25.871 --> 38:27.802
there's a name on here I recognized.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.357
Poul Oskar.

38:29.534 --> 38:32.334
- The pathologist?
- I'm staring at his name right now.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.390
He started the subscription a month ago.

38:43.936 --> 38:45.382
_

38:45.384 --> 38:48.864
He had access to all the autopsy
reports, crime scene photos.

38:48.865 --> 38:51.654
He could have easily got his hands
on chloroform and surgical gloves.

38:51.655 --> 38:54.848
Ellie. I sent her over there to
review some autopsy reports.

38:54.849 --> 38:57.454
- She's there with him right now!
- Scheiße!

39:02.257 --> 39:04.039
OK, we'll be there in fifteen minutes.

39:04.053 --> 39:06.388
I'll grab Luke and Arabela
and get over there right now.

39:06.696 --> 39:08.180
If that bastard hurts her

39:08.181 --> 39:09.981
Sebastian, just go.

39:13.304 --> 39:16.309
It's getting late, so,
I think I'm gonna go.

39:16.310 --> 39:17.589
I just finished.

39:21.352 --> 39:22.812
- Hiya.
- Ellie?

39:22.831 --> 39:24.839
We think Oskar could be the killer.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.060
That's interesting, I think so too.

39:27.078 --> 39:28.459
Help will be there any minute.

39:28.473 --> 39:30.534
Don't try anything,
he's extremely dangerous.

39:30.543 --> 39:32.536
Just stay calm, and wait.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.584
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

39:34.585 --> 39:36.029
Do you want me to stay on the line?

39:36.030 --> 39:39.197
Uh, no, better not, but thanks.
Bye.

39:44.484 --> 39:45.684
You know.

39:48.531 --> 39:49.731
Don't you?

39:52.892 --> 39:55.270
They never did catch your
brother's murderer, did they?

39:55.501 --> 39:58.077
Most murders go unsolved.

39:58.351 --> 39:59.963
They're on their way, so...

40:01.238 --> 40:02.958
I'll be gone before they get here.

40:03.204 --> 40:05.250
Why did you kill those people?

40:09.381 --> 40:10.950
You wanna know that?

40:12.218 --> 40:13.513
The cruelty.

40:13.667 --> 40:14.872
I see

40:14.887 --> 40:16.182
every day,

40:16.185 --> 40:18.289
the victims, the suffering,

40:18.690 --> 40:21.086
the men who commit these atrocities,

40:21.096 --> 40:24.111
they walk away free laughing at us.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.387
- That's why.
- No, no, sorry!

40:26.726 --> 40:27.940
You're not going anywhere.

40:27.941 --> 40:30.072
- Move out of my way!
- I'm a law enforcement officer,

40:30.073 --> 40:31.359
I can't let you go.

40:56.408 --> 40:57.613
You OK?

40:57.996 --> 40:59.427
Eh, yeah I'm fine.

41:06.390 --> 41:09.945
- Woah, woah! Enough, Sebastian.
- OK, OK, all right. All right.

41:16.792 --> 41:18.507
Come on, let's get you out of here.

41:22.510 --> 41:24.887
Looks like his son doesn't
need my help after all.

41:24.939 --> 41:27.131
Come on, you. Let's go.

41:31.381 --> 41:35.592
Nocek, the suspected murderer
you rescued from the freezer...

41:35.762 --> 41:37.785
Yeah? What about him?

41:37.832 --> 41:40.167
A prisoner informant in Hamburg.

41:40.228 --> 41:41.915
said that his cellmate

41:41.954 --> 41:44.757
said that he was the one who murdered
Greta... what... what's her name?

41:44.770 --> 41:46.062
- Hendrix.
- Hendrix.

41:46.474 --> 41:47.977
In that restaurant.

41:48.511 --> 41:50.978
So, you're saying we saved an innocent man?

41:51.725 --> 41:54.443
- So it would appear.
- Oh, that's nice for a change.

41:54.957 --> 41:56.158
Thank you.

41:58.143 --> 41:59.429
Costante.

42:01.512 --> 42:03.795
Would you like to say something to me?

42:05.527 --> 42:06.727
Uh...

42:07.063 --> 42:08.263
no.

42:08.682 --> 42:10.327
Julian Ridderhoff

42:10.842 --> 42:12.392
was a victim.

42:13.664 --> 42:15.053
He was a monster

42:15.173 --> 42:16.816
killed by another monster.

42:16.831 --> 42:20.196
By a man who became a monster because
of the horrors that he had seen.

42:20.267 --> 42:23.693
You think there may be a lesson
in that that might apply to you?

42:24.742 --> 42:26.405
I don't need the lecture, Mr. Dorn.

42:26.849 --> 42:29.411
We are passionate investigators, you and I.

42:29.774 --> 42:32.926
And it's a passion that is
fuelled by an anger that exists

42:32.944 --> 42:34.639
because try as we might,

42:34.687 --> 42:36.518
we cannot catch them all.

42:36.707 --> 42:38.098
I had to watch

42:38.999 --> 42:42.077
a genocidal war criminal walk out of court

42:42.101 --> 42:45.681
because in the eyes of the
judges, I failed to convict him.

42:45.783 --> 42:47.351
It made me crazy.

42:47.873 --> 42:51.057
I had to struggle to keep
my anger from destroying me.

42:51.057 --> 42:55.210
We cannot allow our anger to
turn on ourselves. You cannot.

42:56.628 --> 42:59.240
I can't change that. I won't.

43:00.108 --> 43:03.842
My anger is part of me. It...
it's what keeps me going.

43:04.084 --> 43:07.067
I am simply saying that
if you are not careful,

43:07.291 --> 43:09.701
if you do not marshal your anger,

43:10.719 --> 43:12.196
it can turn on you.

43:12.561 --> 43:13.872
And destroy you.

43:15.692 --> 43:17.281
Thanks for the pep talk.

43:26.474 --> 43:28.281
Uh, hm...

43:28.992 --> 43:30.563
I'm glad I'm here.

43:32.048 --> 43:33.549
Costante,

43:33.839 --> 43:37.799
I am so very, very glad

43:37.919 --> 43:39.563
that you are here.
