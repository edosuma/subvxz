02:04.238 --> 02:06.241
<i>Pine Grove. This is Ken.</i>

02:06.274 --> 02:11.346
Um, hello. This is Helen Wilson
at 227 Cosgrove.

02:11.380 --> 02:12.882
Would you repeat
what I just said?

02:12.914 --> 02:15.817
<i>"Helen Wilson. 227 Cosgrove."</i>

02:15.851 --> 02:19.388
Good. Um, I just wasn't sure
you could actually listen.

02:19.420 --> 02:23.459
- <i>I'm sorry, I...</i>
- Because I've called this place at least a half dozen times...

02:23.491 --> 02:28.329
...requesting that
you stop sending me your brochure.

02:28.363 --> 02:32.601
- <i>Pardon?</i>
- You know, just, like, don't waste any more paper.

02:32.633 --> 02:34.435
Save on the postage,

02:34.468 --> 02:36.437
because I am not now,

02:36.471 --> 02:38.140
nor will I ever be,

02:38.173 --> 02:43.579
at all interested in living in
your swanky old people's home.

02:43.612 --> 02:45.781
- Have you got that?
- <i>Well, may I...</i>

02:45.813 --> 02:47.850
Thank you. Goodbye.

02:50.852 --> 02:52.688
Hey, Helen. How are ya?

02:52.721 --> 02:54.122
Still breathin'.
You?

02:54.156 --> 02:56.358
Hey, you ever decide
to list your house again,

02:56.390 --> 02:57.859
my sister's offer still stands.

02:57.893 --> 03:00.696
As I've told you before,
it's not for sale.

03:00.728 --> 03:03.732
Tell your sister
I'll list it when I'm dead.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.586
Grandma, you did it again?

03:33.829 --> 03:35.931
Maybe we should put
a spare key in one of the pots.

03:35.964 --> 03:38.267
Yeah, but then I'd forget which pot.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.436
<i>I'm so impressed.</i>

03:40.468 --> 03:41.870
Only three weeks on the job,

03:41.902 --> 03:44.305
and you're already
assistant manager.

03:44.339 --> 03:45.708
Did they give you a raise?

03:45.740 --> 03:48.276
A little one,
but it'll help at school.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.979
Mmm, makes me very happy

03:50.012 --> 03:52.782
that you decided
to further your education.

03:53.681 --> 03:56.851
"Education is
the most powerful weapon to..."

03:56.884 --> 03:58.519
"Change the world."

03:58.553 --> 04:00.389
- Nelson Mandela.
- Yeah.

04:01.288 --> 04:04.192
I must say I am going to miss
our Thursday teas.

04:04.226 --> 04:06.127
You could always
invite Mom instead.

04:06.161 --> 04:07.663
When's the last time
you saw each other?

04:07.696 --> 04:09.531
- I don't remember.
- Sure you do.

04:09.563 --> 04:13.535
Do you really wanna go back over
all of that again, what she did?

04:13.567 --> 04:15.036
Grandma, she didn't do anything.

04:16.238 --> 04:18.640
She tried to talk me into selling
my home so she could have a sale.

04:18.673 --> 04:21.341
- That's not what she did.
- You're gonna side with her now?

04:21.375 --> 04:24.380
You and Mom are the two most
important people in my life.

04:25.013 --> 04:26.448
When I go away to school,

04:26.480 --> 04:29.117
I wanna make sure that
you're both gonna be okay,

04:29.150 --> 04:32.020
that you're gonna talk to each
other, be nice to each other.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.455
I can't come home
every time you two have a fight.

04:34.489 --> 04:36.458
Communicate to her,

04:36.491 --> 04:38.460
"Life is 10%
what happens to you

04:38.492 --> 04:41.696
and 90%
how you respond to it."

04:41.729 --> 04:43.032
Lou Holtz.

04:43.064 --> 04:44.966
Wow! We're quoting
football coaches now?

04:44.999 --> 04:48.636
Mr. Holtz happens to be
a published author.

04:48.669 --> 04:50.840
- I only quote authors.
- Snob.

04:51.873 --> 04:53.275
"In three words,
I can sum up

04:53.308 --> 04:54.877
everything I've learned
about life."

04:54.910 --> 04:56.578
- "It goes on."
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.611 --> 04:58.147
Robert Frost.

04:58.179 --> 05:01.449
I taught you that when your
little hamster died, remember?

05:01.482 --> 05:03.084
Grandma, it goes on.

05:03.919 --> 05:06.822
Papa's been gone
for nearly three years now.

05:06.854 --> 05:10.458
You stopped teaching, you don't go
out, and Mom lives so close.

05:10.491 --> 05:13.996
And she wants to help you and she
wants to see you, but you shut her out.

05:14.028 --> 05:16.230
She's a pain in the ass.

05:16.263 --> 05:18.199
And she's bossy!

05:19.034 --> 05:21.470
Besides, I'm fine.

05:21.503 --> 05:23.039
- Really?
- Yes.

05:24.172 --> 05:27.376
Whenever you want me to believe
something you're saying is true,

05:27.409 --> 05:29.611
your eyes, they get
all squinty and twitchy.

05:29.643 --> 05:30.978
They do not!

05:31.011 --> 05:32.280
Yes, they do.
They're doing it right now.

05:32.313 --> 05:33.982
- I am not!
- You are doing it right now.

05:34.015 --> 05:36.351
- I am not!
- Just like this. "Mm-mm-mm."

05:36.383 --> 05:37.652
No, I don't do that.

05:37.686 --> 05:38.821
Yes, you are. Go check.

05:38.854 --> 05:41.090
Look. There.

06:08.616 --> 06:10.285
Oh!

06:10.318 --> 06:11.821
Damn it.

06:19.561 --> 06:20.796
Ugh.

06:28.804 --> 06:30.438
No!

07:07.676 --> 07:08.911
Mom?

07:09.443 --> 07:10.513
Mom!

07:30.232 --> 07:31.799
How'd you sleep, Grandma?

07:31.833 --> 07:33.234
Okay, I guess.

07:34.068 --> 07:35.304
Thanks, honey.

07:36.737 --> 07:38.072
- What is it?
- Oat bran.

07:38.105 --> 07:39.741
It's good for you.
I eat it all the time.

07:40.575 --> 07:44.212
I don't usually eat...
cereal for breakfast.

07:45.679 --> 07:47.281
- What are those?
- Calcium.

07:47.314 --> 07:49.116
Good for the bones.
I'll get you some water.

07:49.150 --> 07:51.053
Mom's getting an estimate
from the contractor.

07:51.085 --> 07:52.453
- Oh.
- He still has to see it.

07:52.487 --> 07:54.523
But based on what information
I could give him,

07:54.556 --> 07:57.626
he thinks demolition and remodel
will take at least a month.

07:57.659 --> 08:00.128
That's ridiculous!
It's not that bad.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.398
- Yes, it is.
- You should just stay here.

08:04.032 --> 08:06.668
O-Or you could stay
with your sister.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.237
Teresa?

08:08.270 --> 08:11.907
Yeah, she, um... She told me
she saw a spaceship last week,

08:11.939 --> 08:13.674
and they tried to abduct her,

08:13.708 --> 08:15.710
but she couldn't fit through
the door 'cause she was too fat.

08:15.744 --> 08:18.080
Well, she has put on a few pounds.

08:18.112 --> 08:19.982
That wasn't exactly my point.

08:20.015 --> 08:21.350
What about...

08:22.751 --> 08:23.785
Pine Grove?

08:23.818 --> 08:25.387
No!

08:25.419 --> 08:28.155
So you're the one
behind their harassment.

08:28.188 --> 08:29.924
I should've known.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.360
Always trying to control
every situation.

08:32.393 --> 08:34.595
I'm controlling? You're the one
who kept the truth from me

08:34.628 --> 08:36.498
about how sick Daddy was
until towards the end.

08:36.530 --> 08:39.167
- What do you call that?
- Oh, not again.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.636
You were going through
a terrible divorce.

08:41.669 --> 08:44.506
I didn't think you needed
any more stress in your life.

08:44.538 --> 08:46.475
It wasn't your decision to make.
He's <i>my</i> dad.

08:46.508 --> 08:48.877
It was up to me how to get
through the end of his life.

08:48.909 --> 08:50.511
- Not you.
- Forgive me.

08:50.545 --> 08:55.050
I am sorry that I was trying to
protect my daughter from pain.

08:55.082 --> 08:57.251
Stop trying to protect me.
I am a grown woman.

08:57.284 --> 09:01.689
Yeah, well, you... You tell them
to stop sending me these things!

09:01.723 --> 09:03.892
Mom, if you were at Pine Grove,

09:03.925 --> 09:06.561
this fire would never
have happened.

09:07.295 --> 09:10.532
I-I think
the best choice for you,

09:10.565 --> 09:11.833
for all of us right now,

09:11.865 --> 09:14.235
is to just go check it out.

09:14.268 --> 09:17.273
Maybe stay there for a little
while until your house is done.

09:19.507 --> 09:21.542
All right. I'll check it out.

09:21.575 --> 09:24.312
- But I am not spending the rest of my life there.
- Don't be dramatic.

09:24.345 --> 09:26.648
And I better not find a For
Sale sign on my front lawn.

09:26.681 --> 09:29.216
Mom, honestly, for the last
time, will you...

09:29.249 --> 09:32.386
Your house was never
for sale, I promise.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.923
You are the only one
who can list it.

09:34.955 --> 09:36.624
I just...
I just asked around

09:36.657 --> 09:39.061
to see if people would be
interested if it were for sale.

09:39.094 --> 09:40.494
Yeah, but it's not for sale.

09:40.527 --> 09:43.331
And I am not interested in selling it.

09:43.364 --> 09:46.268
You look at a piece of property,
and you see a commodity.

09:46.968 --> 09:49.304
We're talking about my home.

09:49.336 --> 09:52.206
Your father and I built
that house together.

09:52.239 --> 09:53.508
We painted the walls.

09:53.541 --> 09:56.177
We... We planted the garden.

09:56.210 --> 09:59.715
We carried the tiles home
in our lap from Portugal.

09:59.748 --> 10:01.249
We raised you there.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.384
Mom...

10:03.417 --> 10:07.121
I know that you think that
I'm being a terrible person,

10:07.154 --> 10:08.489
but I love you,

10:08.523 --> 10:12.027
and I am concerned
for your safety.

10:12.060 --> 10:15.164
First the flood and now a fire.

10:17.499 --> 10:20.069
I think it's too dangerous
for you to live alone.

10:20.869 --> 10:22.738
No, it's not.

10:25.507 --> 10:26.642
But...

10:27.642 --> 10:31.046
I'm gonna need
to stay at some place

10:31.779 --> 10:33.414
during the renovation.

10:34.983 --> 10:36.351
I'll stay there.

10:36.383 --> 10:39.555
But as soon as it's over,
I'm back home.

10:49.229 --> 10:50.865
Welcome to Pine Grove!

10:50.898 --> 10:53.200
- Oh, is that everything?
- Uh, it's enough.

10:53.234 --> 10:55.604
I'm only gonna be here a month.

10:55.637 --> 10:57.973
Welcome to Pine Grove!

10:58.005 --> 10:59.407
Hope you're hungry.

11:00.207 --> 11:01.642
Morning, ladies.

11:01.676 --> 11:04.211
Welcome to Pine Grove.

11:04.244 --> 11:06.782
- I-I'm Arthur Lane.
- Welcome to Pine Grove!

11:06.815 --> 11:09.685
Is somebody going to say that
every 12 seconds?

11:10.484 --> 11:12.686
Is your mom on
any special medication?

11:12.720 --> 11:15.090
My mother takes pills
to cure her dry sense of humor.

11:15.123 --> 11:16.590
I see.

11:16.624 --> 11:18.325
Mr. DeNardo, I'm on
a really tight schedule today.

11:18.359 --> 11:20.796
- Can we get my mom settled in?
- Yeah.

11:25.399 --> 11:28.302
Beautiful, right?
And this is just the beginning.

11:28.335 --> 11:30.038
Walk with me, won't you?

11:31.973 --> 11:34.676
In addition to activities
in the main lobby area,

11:34.709 --> 11:37.412
we also feature
art classes, bingo,

11:37.445 --> 11:40.515
and we have
speed dating once a month.

11:40.547 --> 11:42.149
Speed dating?

11:42.182 --> 11:44.952
I've always preferred
slow dating myself.

11:44.985 --> 11:46.388
Now, this is my office.

11:46.421 --> 11:48.590
Feel free to come see me
if you ever need anything.

11:48.623 --> 11:51.759
Ah, this is our certified
massage therapist, Lito Santos.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.361
Yeah, he also teaches
yoga and tai chi.

11:54.394 --> 11:56.230
Welcome to Pine Grove!

11:56.263 --> 11:58.767
Could you send
a memo around to everybody

11:58.800 --> 12:00.001
to stop saying that?

12:00.033 --> 12:01.302
I'm welcome. I've got it.

12:01.335 --> 12:03.071
- Will do.
- Yeah.

12:03.104 --> 12:05.206
I'm gonna be gone in a month.

12:05.239 --> 12:07.643
Moved out, not dead.

12:08.209 --> 12:09.411
Very nice to meet you.

12:09.444 --> 12:11.246
Oh, uh, how do you do?

12:11.278 --> 12:13.181
- I'm Helen Wilson.
- Mmm?

12:13.214 --> 12:14.850
And this is my daughter, Laura.

12:14.883 --> 12:16.184
Whoa, tall!

12:16.216 --> 12:19.287
- My grandson, Peter.
- Also tall.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.724
Just so you know,
these are very healing hands

12:22.757 --> 12:24.893
filled with
very positive energy.

12:24.926 --> 12:26.728
Ah, I see. Thank you.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.795
Excuse me.

12:31.132 --> 12:32.467
- Lito?
- Yes?

12:32.499 --> 12:34.602
You seem like a very upbeat,
spiritual person.

12:34.635 --> 12:35.469
Thank you.

12:35.503 --> 12:37.372
She hates that. So do I.

12:39.474 --> 12:42.210
We have a big,
comfortable screening room

12:42.243 --> 12:43.545
where we show movies,

12:43.577 --> 12:45.279
and our own beauty salon.

12:45.312 --> 12:47.848
Uh... does she like to exercise?

12:47.882 --> 12:50.051
She burns most of her calories
rolling her eyes.

12:50.084 --> 12:51.686
I see.

12:51.719 --> 12:55.223
On the other side of this
building is our workout room,

12:55.255 --> 12:57.958
and next to that
is an indoor swimming pool.

12:57.992 --> 13:01.096
- And we're about to start an expansion...
- I couldn't agree more.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.598
Janet Poindexter
is a total bitch.

13:03.630 --> 13:06.667
- And she smells like cheese.
- Oh!

13:06.700 --> 13:07.735
Cheese?

13:08.335 --> 13:10.672
So, what do you think so far?

13:10.705 --> 13:14.242
- I think I should give up dairy.
- Yeah, we all should.

13:14.274 --> 13:15.343
Ah, ah.

13:15.909 --> 13:17.645
Okay, here it is.

13:17.678 --> 13:19.079
Ah? Come on in.

13:19.113 --> 13:21.183
Welcome, welcome.

13:21.215 --> 13:24.418
Looked bigger on my phone.

13:25.286 --> 13:27.589
Now, uh, lunch starts at 11:00.

13:27.622 --> 13:29.056
- Will everyone be join...
- Sorry.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.792
Mom, I have an open house.

13:30.825 --> 13:33.228
Mom, if it's okay with you,
I'll stay for a while and help.

13:33.260 --> 13:34.695
Well, how will you get home?

13:34.729 --> 13:36.864
- I'll call a friend.
- Okay.

13:36.898 --> 13:38.300
Okay. Two of you, then.

13:38.332 --> 13:40.268
I'll see you in the dining room.

13:41.134 --> 13:42.803
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, dear.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.643
Okay, I got a surprise for you.

13:49.676 --> 13:50.512
Really?

13:50.545 --> 13:52.113
I downloaded some classics.

13:52.146 --> 13:53.649
One second.

14:24.278 --> 14:26.847
Oh.

14:30.018 --> 14:32.454
I-I know it's not gonna
be easy, Grandma.

14:33.287 --> 14:34.688
But "It always seems
impossible..."

14:34.721 --> 14:36.957
"Until it's done."

14:36.990 --> 14:38.559
Nelson Mandela.

14:39.826 --> 14:40.995
I love you, Peter.

14:41.028 --> 14:42.364
I love you too, Grandma.

14:44.431 --> 14:48.168
You know, I think I wanna
put things away by myself.

14:48.201 --> 14:49.737
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

14:49.771 --> 14:50.604
Okay.

14:50.638 --> 14:52.239
Okay, well,
I'll, um...

14:52.273 --> 14:54.175
I'll just call you later, okay?

14:54.207 --> 14:56.043
- Okay.
- Okay. I love you.

14:56.076 --> 14:57.578
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

15:17.364 --> 15:18.933
This sucks, Charlie.

16:00.608 --> 16:02.010
Can I help you?

16:02.844 --> 16:05.379
No, thank you.
I'm just waiting for lunch.

16:05.412 --> 16:07.114
Can you wait somewhere else?

16:07.148 --> 16:08.383
What?

16:08.416 --> 16:10.852
This table is
by invitation only.

16:10.884 --> 16:11.985
Are you serious?

16:12.018 --> 16:14.054
She used to say,
"Serious as a heart attack,"

16:14.088 --> 16:17.392
but then Marjorie keeled over,
so she don't say it anymore.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.728
Have a nice day. Bye.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.963
What is this?

16:22.997 --> 16:24.032
Ah, geez.

16:25.465 --> 16:26.701
Wipes.

16:29.202 --> 16:32.606
Stay away from them.
We call them the Queen B's.

16:32.639 --> 16:34.542
Guess what the "B" stands for?

16:35.343 --> 16:36.845
- Got it.
- Hmm.

16:56.898 --> 16:58.133
Pulse.

17:02.170 --> 17:03.604
Okay, ladies, let's go.

17:03.638 --> 17:05.039
Let's go.

17:05.070 --> 17:07.775
Remember, sweat is just
fat crying for attention!

17:09.108 --> 17:12.012
You're the one
crying for attention, lady.

17:12.679 --> 17:14.681
And roll it out. That's it.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.184
Get loose, very nice.

17:16.215 --> 17:19.086
And two arms straight up.

17:19.118 --> 17:22.357
That's it. Reach for the sky.
Grab the clouds.

17:22.388 --> 17:23.724
Very good.

17:23.757 --> 17:26.126
Two arms to the right.

17:26.159 --> 17:27.627
Looking good, ladies.

17:27.661 --> 17:31.165
And to the left. That's it.

17:32.399 --> 17:37.773
And two arms behind you
and stretch.

17:38.872 --> 17:39.907
Pablo?

17:41.475 --> 17:43.610
Yes, Margot.

17:43.644 --> 17:48.049
When I do this stretch,
something in my chest hurts.

17:48.081 --> 17:49.484
Is that normal?

17:49.516 --> 17:52.286
Maybe you can check me out?

17:53.087 --> 17:55.323
Perhaps Dr. Stevenson
should take a look.

17:55.356 --> 17:58.660
Mmm, I'd prefer you to do it.

17:58.693 --> 18:01.562
Margot, are you
flirting with me?

18:01.596 --> 18:03.532
Yes!

18:04.498 --> 18:06.033
Hello over there.

18:07.068 --> 18:09.070
You wanna join
our aquatics class?

18:09.102 --> 18:10.571
Um, no, thank you.

18:10.605 --> 18:13.608
- It's a lot of fun.
- I'm sure it is.

18:18.913 --> 18:21.015
All right, ladies. Back to it.

18:28.856 --> 18:31.792
Are you flirting with that guy
with a squirrel on his head?

18:32.526 --> 18:35.562
Esther said
he's a wonderful lover.

18:35.596 --> 18:37.098
Oh, and here comes my lunch.

18:37.130 --> 18:39.066
I bet he takes Viagra.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.070
From the looks
on the faces of the ladies,

18:42.102 --> 18:44.238
he's buyin' it by the truckload.

18:59.352 --> 19:00.621
Peter!

19:01.955 --> 19:03.390
Hi, honey.

19:03.424 --> 19:05.627
<i>Hi, Grandma.
I'm about to leave for work</i>

19:05.659 --> 19:07.829
<i>but I wanted to see
how you're doing.</i>

19:07.861 --> 19:09.397
I'm doing fine.

19:09.429 --> 19:12.100
<i>Have you met
some of the other residents?</i>

19:12.132 --> 19:14.067
- Uh-huh.
- And?

19:14.100 --> 19:16.870
"If you don't have
anything nice to say..."

19:16.904 --> 19:18.640
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

19:18.673 --> 19:21.542
Uh, there are
some lovely people here.

19:21.576 --> 19:24.946
- Tell me what you've done to get involved.
- I only have a month here.

19:24.978 --> 19:27.948
Grandma, "Life is all about
having a good time."

19:28.549 --> 19:29.716
Oh, my God.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.053
Are you actually quoting
Miley Cyrus?

19:32.086 --> 19:34.822
Yes. I want you to do
something for me,

19:34.855 --> 19:36.524
your only grandchild,

19:36.557 --> 19:39.494
<i>and I'm not hanging up
until you say you'll do it.</i>

19:39.526 --> 19:41.896
Even if it makes me
late for work.

19:43.763 --> 19:46.067
Okay, I think I've found one.

19:58.612 --> 20:00.113
Are you gonna play a card today,

20:00.147 --> 20:01.782
or should we all
just go take a nap?

20:01.815 --> 20:05.252
Well, I had quite
a long evening last night.

20:05.285 --> 20:08.523
So what the heck?
Let's all take a nap.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.691
Play the diamond.

20:16.062 --> 20:17.098
Hmm.

20:18.599 --> 20:21.034
Hello, everybody.
I'm Helen Wilson.

20:21.068 --> 20:23.805
I was wondering who I'd talk to
to join the bridge club.

20:23.838 --> 20:26.840
It's run by Janet Poindexter.

20:26.873 --> 20:29.743
- Oh, and where might I find her?
- Right here.

20:30.878 --> 20:33.481
Oh. Hello... again.

20:33.513 --> 20:36.984
Uh, I'm interested
in joining the bridge club.

20:37.017 --> 20:38.352
The roster's full.

20:39.219 --> 20:40.053
Okay.

20:40.087 --> 20:41.756
Well, if you ever need someone,

20:41.789 --> 20:44.292
I'm considered
a pretty good player, so...

20:44.324 --> 20:45.726
Someone needs a hearing aid.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.196
No, I actually have
hearing aids, thank you.

20:49.230 --> 20:50.264
We're full.

20:50.296 --> 20:53.000
Okay.

20:53.033 --> 20:56.604
Well, I heard
Janet Poindexter's a real bitch.

21:00.675 --> 21:03.677
Oh, oh!

21:06.680 --> 21:09.516
- That wasn't water, was it?
- It's happy hour somewhere!

21:13.987 --> 21:15.756
Go right now, ladies.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.926
Go, go, go!

21:18.725 --> 21:20.194
Several guidelines

21:20.226 --> 21:22.397
for acceptable behavior
in our contract were violated.

21:23.630 --> 21:27.000
In addition to which, the entire
Dessert of the Day program

21:27.033 --> 21:29.403
is now in question,
or at least the flambé portion.

21:29.436 --> 21:32.173
Okay, Warden. Enough.

21:32.773 --> 21:35.042
I'm going back to my cell now.

21:38.212 --> 21:42.116
Look, if your mother can't get
involved with the other residents,

21:42.148 --> 21:45.585
then this might not be
the right place for her.

21:45.619 --> 21:49.456
I hear you want the Phillips
property for your expansion.

21:49.490 --> 21:50.758
Uh, wh... Tha...

21:50.791 --> 21:52.326
It's... How do you know that?

21:52.359 --> 21:55.495
Currently I do a lot of business
with the Phillips family.

21:55.529 --> 21:57.898
Well, it's just that, um,

21:57.932 --> 22:00.234
the expansion would be
such a great addition...

22:00.266 --> 22:02.536
If my mother leaves here
before her home is repaired,

22:02.570 --> 22:03.870
she will have to stay with me

22:03.904 --> 22:06.041
and you can kiss
your expansion goodbye.

22:06.706 --> 22:08.141
But...

22:08.175 --> 22:12.379
if she's happy
during her time here...

22:12.413 --> 22:14.282
What does she like to do?

22:16.751 --> 22:19.087
- She loves flowers.
- Perfect!

22:19.119 --> 22:20.921
We've got
a little flower shop here.

22:20.955 --> 22:22.956
It's not much,
but we do provide a service.

22:22.990 --> 22:24.726
- We do get rather busy.
- Whatever it takes.

22:24.759 --> 22:26.461
You make my mother happy,

22:26.494 --> 22:29.097
I'll make sure you get a fair
deal with the Phillips family.

22:30.731 --> 22:32.667
Oh! Yes.

22:38.973 --> 22:40.942
- Oh, damn.
- Are you okay?

22:40.975 --> 22:43.477
Oh! Just I forgot my key.

22:43.511 --> 22:45.080
Mmm, it happens all the time.

22:45.579 --> 22:47.115
- May I?
- Yeah?

22:47.148 --> 22:50.251
- I have a master.
- Oh, good. Thank you.

22:52.285 --> 22:54.455
Home again, home again,
jiggety-jig.

22:54.487 --> 22:56.189
Oh, great. Here they are.

22:56.223 --> 22:58.326
Right where I put them
so I don't forget them.

22:59.793 --> 23:02.629
I have some time before my next
physical therapy appointment.

23:02.663 --> 23:05.767
Have you ever had
a shiatsu massage?

23:05.800 --> 23:09.270
No. My sister in Santa Fe
swears by them.

23:09.302 --> 23:12.773
But she also sleeps with
a ring of turquoise crystals

23:12.807 --> 23:14.041
around her head.

23:14.073 --> 23:16.744
So, you wanna try one?

23:17.410 --> 23:18.446
I dunno.

23:26.119 --> 23:28.889
Charlie and I
were both teachers...

23:29.956 --> 23:33.360
but ballroom dancing
was our thing.

23:33.894 --> 23:35.296
That's lovely.

23:37.330 --> 23:41.436
He was a few years
younger than I was.

23:42.336 --> 23:45.106
I always thought
I would go first.

23:45.805 --> 23:48.242
That's why it was such a shock.

23:49.243 --> 23:50.278
Of course.

23:50.778 --> 23:52.413
I miss him every day.

23:54.715 --> 23:56.551
My divorce was a shock.

23:57.517 --> 24:00.620
But we were not meant
to be together.

24:00.654 --> 24:04.058
Took me
a long time to realize that.

24:05.024 --> 24:07.294
But we are happier now,

24:07.328 --> 24:11.199
and she and my new wife
are even friends.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.301
- Mmm!
- Two against one.

24:14.334 --> 24:18.038
Oh, I wish my daughter
had that approach.

24:18.071 --> 24:19.706
She's just so...

24:19.740 --> 24:23.378
Oh, God, I love shiatsu.

24:30.984 --> 24:32.520
All right, all right, all right.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.189
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm here.

24:35.789 --> 24:37.025
I'm here.

24:37.992 --> 24:40.395
Oh, it's you.

24:41.195 --> 24:43.965
Uh, if you're here
to get me to apologize

24:43.997 --> 24:45.265
for what I said to Janet...

24:45.299 --> 24:48.135
I'm not.
She can be a total bitch.

24:48.167 --> 24:51.138
- Oh.
- Here.

24:52.039 --> 24:54.141
Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.

24:54.174 --> 24:56.577
Well, I know
it's not easy settling in.

24:56.609 --> 24:57.945
It was tough on me too.

24:57.977 --> 24:59.580
Oh, well, thank you.

25:00.513 --> 25:03.551
Uh, uh, I-I don't know
your name, actually.

25:03.583 --> 25:04.751
Sally Hanson.

25:04.784 --> 25:05.952
Sally.

25:05.985 --> 25:07.354
Do you wanna come in?

25:07.388 --> 25:09.389
Oh, thank you.

25:12.559 --> 25:13.628
Well...

25:17.932 --> 25:19.433
So...

25:19.465 --> 25:22.703
last night, Anne,
my bridge partner,

25:22.735 --> 25:24.437
- she passed away.
- Oh.

25:24.471 --> 25:26.407
Cardiac arrest.

25:26.439 --> 25:28.441
I'm gonna really miss her.
She was a lot of fun.

25:28.475 --> 25:31.478
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

25:32.178 --> 25:34.282
I'm on my way
to her service now.

25:34.314 --> 25:35.548
Uh-huh.

25:35.581 --> 25:36.618
Look...

25:37.551 --> 25:39.086
I need a bridge partner.

25:39.119 --> 25:41.022
Are you as good
as you say you are?

25:41.554 --> 25:43.189
Actually, I'm...

25:43.223 --> 25:44.759
terrific.

25:44.792 --> 25:48.095
I have never heard anyone
speak to Janet the way you did.

25:48.128 --> 25:49.664
It was awesome.

25:50.363 --> 25:51.798
Would you like to team up

25:51.831 --> 25:53.066
and kick her butt?

25:53.100 --> 25:55.302
Well, I'll have to
think about that.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.737
Oh, why?

25:56.770 --> 25:59.240
I mean, you want to join bridge.

25:59.273 --> 26:02.475
Well, I did,
and now I'm not so sure.

26:02.509 --> 26:05.579
And, you know, I'm only gonna
be here for like a month.

26:05.611 --> 26:08.381
You could become one of us.
You could sit at our table.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.283
I don't want to sit
at your table.

26:10.317 --> 26:11.886
This isn't high school.

26:12.418 --> 26:15.188
You're right. It's worse.

26:15.222 --> 26:17.558
High school we graduate.

26:17.590 --> 26:19.394
Here, we die.

26:20.260 --> 26:23.698
Or we fight against it
until our last breath.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.568
So, what are you
gonna do?

26:28.668 --> 26:31.004
Surrender or fight?

26:32.939 --> 26:34.574
Just think about it.

26:50.189 --> 26:52.659
Again, welcome to Pine Grove.

26:52.693 --> 26:54.528
- Yeah.
- Welcome to Pine Grove!

26:54.561 --> 26:56.097
Hello.

26:56.129 --> 26:58.366
You look like you could use
some homemade lasagna.

26:58.398 --> 27:01.601
My homemade chicken soup
is healthier.

27:01.635 --> 27:03.371
Riboflavins.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.040
It's so very nice of you,
but, um, I made plans.

27:06.072 --> 27:09.142
I-I'm gonna eat
in the dining room today.

27:09.176 --> 27:11.545
But thank you so much.
That's really sweet.

27:21.355 --> 27:23.224
Excuse me, uh, Helen, um...

27:23.991 --> 27:25.993
would you mind
if I join you for lunch?

27:26.025 --> 27:27.594
It looks like you already have.

27:27.628 --> 27:28.495
Yeah.

27:28.529 --> 27:30.999
- How do you know my name?
- Ah.

27:31.932 --> 27:33.201
Well...

27:34.001 --> 27:36.203
You see, I
used to run a company,

27:36.235 --> 27:40.340
and, uh, I believe
I developed this sixth sense,

27:40.373 --> 27:42.642
noticing special things
about certain people.

27:42.676 --> 27:45.713
You put some of those things
together, and you come up with a name.

27:45.745 --> 27:47.214
Mmm.

27:47.246 --> 27:49.816
Has that line worked for you
in the past, Mr. Simpson?

27:49.850 --> 27:51.484
N-Not so much.

27:51.517 --> 27:53.520
Yeah, not so much.

27:53.553 --> 27:58.191
Uh, actually, I asked a woman
over there, I asked her,

27:58.225 --> 28:00.427
"Excuse me, could you
tell me the name

28:00.461 --> 28:02.029
of that lady sitting
over there?"

28:02.061 --> 28:03.263
Mm-hmm.

28:03.296 --> 28:05.699
Well, how...
how did you know my name?

28:07.033 --> 28:09.169
I like to know
who my neighbors are,

28:09.203 --> 28:11.539
especially if they're
Peeping Toms.

28:11.571 --> 28:12.406
Oh!

28:12.438 --> 28:13.706
You'll have to excuse me.

28:13.740 --> 28:16.109
I've got some flowers
waiting for me.

28:16.142 --> 28:18.111
- Sure.
- Have a good day, Mr. Simpson.

28:18.145 --> 28:20.114
Thank you, Helen.

28:27.387 --> 28:29.590
One rose deserves another.

28:30.724 --> 28:32.025
Thank you.

28:32.059 --> 28:34.428
I think this is called stalking.

28:35.028 --> 28:36.630
Actually, uh, it-it could be.

28:36.663 --> 28:39.233
But the truth is,
I heard this was an activity,

28:39.265 --> 28:41.069
and I thought I'd volunteer.

28:41.635 --> 28:42.970
Mm-hmm.

28:43.003 --> 28:45.572
A man like you,
arranging flowers?

28:45.606 --> 28:47.675
A man like me...
I mean, I, um...

28:47.707 --> 28:49.976
I had a wife
who got very, very sick.

28:50.010 --> 28:52.313
And I made a habit of

28:52.346 --> 28:56.282
arranging flowers for her
every single day.

28:56.315 --> 29:00.253
And, uh, I learned
to love flowers.

29:00.286 --> 29:01.855
Most of them, anyway.

29:01.888 --> 29:03.690
Well, that's very nice.

29:03.724 --> 29:05.426
You know, they, um...

29:06.260 --> 29:08.429
they have a lot of things
to do around here.

29:08.462 --> 29:13.067
I mean, you can do yoga
and aquatics and painting,

29:13.100 --> 29:16.403
and, uh, you know, karaoke.

29:16.436 --> 29:19.473
Have you, uh, volunteered
or wanted to join any of those?

29:19.505 --> 29:22.008
Uh, no, I didn't.

29:22.042 --> 29:26.347
And, frankly, if I did,
I probably wouldn't tell you.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.549
- That's fair enough.
- Yeah.

29:28.581 --> 29:33.186
Look, Mr. Simpson, um,
just to be perfectly clear,

29:33.219 --> 29:35.088
I'm only gonna be here
for a month.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.590
- A month?
- Yeah.

29:36.622 --> 29:39.058
If we're going to be working
together for a month,

29:39.091 --> 29:42.763
it seems only right that
you should call me Dan, no?

29:42.795 --> 29:43.863
All right,

29:43.897 --> 29:46.200
and you can call me Helen.

29:46.233 --> 29:47.902
But, you know,
you're gonna have to learn

29:47.935 --> 29:51.972
how to...
...put those kangaroo paws

29:52.004 --> 29:54.108
in a trumpet vase.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.142
I mean, they have to arch out,
you know?

29:56.176 --> 29:57.410
You're not upset with me?

29:57.444 --> 29:59.079
No, no, no, I'm not upset.

29:59.111 --> 30:02.182
Just, uh, I can't stand
to see 'em in that kind of vase.

30:02.215 --> 30:04.551
See? Like that.

30:04.584 --> 30:06.186
- They spread out?
- Yeah.

30:06.219 --> 30:08.021
You see, they've gotta...

30:08.054 --> 30:09.989
Yeah, that's right.

30:11.524 --> 30:16.062
I mean like saving seats,
cliques.

30:16.096 --> 30:19.700
They're like mean girls but
with medical alert bracelets.

30:21.001 --> 30:23.369
But you were invited to join
Janet Poindexter's group.

30:23.403 --> 30:26.574
Yeah, it felt like
an offer from the mob.

30:26.607 --> 30:29.109
Grandma, it's a chance
to get involved.

30:29.141 --> 30:33.813
Well, you know, I'm arranging
flowers and enjoying it.

30:33.847 --> 30:35.182
No offense, Grandma,

30:35.215 --> 30:37.417
but that's just you in a room
with a bunch of flowers.

30:38.051 --> 30:39.820
"Life is partly what we make it

30:39.852 --> 30:42.590
and partly what it is
made by the friends we choose."

30:42.622 --> 30:43.456
Wait...

30:43.490 --> 30:44.525
Tennessee Williams.

30:44.558 --> 30:45.759
- You got it.
- Yep.

30:45.792 --> 30:48.494
But it's not
an applicable quote

30:48.528 --> 30:50.598
'cause these women
aren't my friends.

30:50.630 --> 30:53.533
Thank God I'm only
stuck here for a month.

30:55.034 --> 30:57.370
Um, uh, uh...

30:57.404 --> 30:59.073
Didn't Mom call you?

30:59.106 --> 31:02.076
I haven't heard from your mother
since she checked me in here.

31:02.109 --> 31:03.343
Why?

31:04.110 --> 31:05.446
Well,

31:05.478 --> 31:07.413
the insurance company
needs a little more time

31:07.446 --> 31:09.015
to assess the damage
on the house,

31:09.049 --> 31:11.918
and the contractor can't start
until they finish,

31:11.952 --> 31:15.455
so it's looking like it's gonna
be an additional week or two.

31:18.658 --> 31:20.026
Great.

31:20.060 --> 31:23.231
So, what am I supposed to do?
Just sit here and wither away?

31:24.097 --> 31:26.000
That doesn't sound like
my grandma talking.

31:26.032 --> 31:29.936
My grandma went to Washington
with Martin Luther King, Jr.

31:29.969 --> 31:31.471
to march for civil rights.

31:31.504 --> 31:35.042
My grandma volunteered
at a battered women's shelter

31:35.074 --> 31:36.442
and taught public school

31:36.475 --> 31:38.177
in the toughest neighborhood
in the city.

31:38.211 --> 31:40.748
My grandma won
teacher of the year.

31:40.781 --> 31:41.849
Twice.

31:41.881 --> 31:43.650
And my grandma
isn't afraid of anyone,

31:43.684 --> 31:47.021
including and especially
Janet Poindexter.

31:48.054 --> 31:49.623
Good speech.

31:50.857 --> 31:52.260
Did it work?

31:55.628 --> 31:57.697
Anne's service yesterday
was really nice, Janet.

31:57.731 --> 31:59.600
You should've been there.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.770
Arthur is taking Anne's place.

32:02.802 --> 32:05.438
In fact, he should be here
any minute.

32:05.472 --> 32:07.641
- I told him not to bother.
- Why?

32:07.674 --> 32:09.576
He's gettin' busy
with Heather Bain.

32:09.609 --> 32:13.547
Wait a minute.
He's "busy" with Heather Bain?

32:13.580 --> 32:16.350
And before lunch,
it was Carol Kramer.

32:16.382 --> 32:18.718
And before breakfast,
it was you.

32:18.752 --> 32:20.654
How is that man standing up?

32:20.686 --> 32:22.388
Doesn't it bother you, Margot?

32:22.421 --> 32:25.692
Well, there are only
so many guys to go around.

32:25.725 --> 32:29.362
Anyway, I found myself
a new partner.

32:29.396 --> 32:31.130
So, who is this new partner
of yours?

32:31.164 --> 32:32.599
Me.

32:32.631 --> 32:34.701
- Hello.
- Hi.

32:37.204 --> 32:38.505
Shall we?

32:40.741 --> 32:41.809
Wipes.

32:46.646 --> 32:49.350
Okay, here we go.

32:49.382 --> 32:50.984
You know what?

32:51.016 --> 32:52.919
If we're gonna play another
game, I need a bathroom break.

32:52.953 --> 32:54.221
Me too.

32:54.253 --> 32:56.756
If you leave the table after
the cards have been dealt,

32:56.790 --> 32:58.125
you forfeit.

32:58.157 --> 32:59.359
That's ridiculous.

32:59.392 --> 33:00.426
Club rules.

33:00.459 --> 33:02.462
That's why I wear Depends.

33:03.295 --> 33:04.798
Okay.

33:24.451 --> 33:26.353
- Pass.
- Uh, two no trump.

33:26.386 --> 33:27.553
Pass.

33:27.587 --> 33:29.423
Three no trump.

33:30.689 --> 33:33.059
<i>♪ La, la, la ♪</i>

33:36.796 --> 33:37.697
Pass.

33:37.731 --> 33:39.700
- Pass.
- Pass!

33:39.733 --> 33:41.635
All but three games.
Oh, I love it.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.503
Helen, you and me,
we make a great team.

33:43.536 --> 33:44.971
- She's out.
- What?

33:45.738 --> 33:47.106
I decide who playing
and who doesn't.

33:47.139 --> 33:50.444
- Those are not the rules.
- I just changed them.

34:26.947 --> 34:28.047
Peter!

34:28.081 --> 34:29.616
<i>Hey, Grandma, good news.</i>

34:29.648 --> 34:31.652
Mom is on the phone
with the insurance company

34:31.685 --> 34:33.853
and it seems they've
signed off on the estimate.

34:33.886 --> 34:35.420
<i>The contractor starts tomorrow.</i>

34:35.455 --> 34:36.857
Wonderful.

34:36.889 --> 34:38.725
<i>But there is
a little bit more work</i>

34:38.757 --> 34:40.259
to be done than we thought.

34:40.293 --> 34:41.962
Uh, what do you mean?

34:41.994 --> 34:44.630
<i>Well, the wood
under the roof was damaged</i>

34:44.663 --> 34:45.898
and needs to be replaced.

34:45.931 --> 34:47.567
And the final inspection
discovered

34:47.601 --> 34:49.603
electrical
and plumbing problems.

34:49.636 --> 34:51.038
Oh, and part of the foundation

34:51.071 --> 34:52.706
needs to be
brought up to code too.

34:52.739 --> 34:54.507
Oh, God, how long
is that gonna take?

34:54.540 --> 34:55.908
An extra four to six weeks.

34:55.942 --> 34:57.478
Oh, no! Damn.

34:57.511 --> 34:58.744
Ow!

34:58.777 --> 35:00.480
- Oh, Peter, I've gotta go.
- Grandma?

35:01.681 --> 35:03.484
All right, all right.

35:07.286 --> 35:10.857
Um, I happened to be
walking down your hallway here,

35:10.891 --> 35:12.860
and I heard you yelling.

35:13.927 --> 35:17.631
You... You happened to be
walking down my hallway?

35:19.065 --> 35:21.134
Yeah, that sounds about right, yes.

35:21.167 --> 35:22.203
Uh-huh.

35:22.868 --> 35:25.171
- I-I stubbed my toe.
- Oh.

35:25.205 --> 35:28.208
You always walk around at night
with a bottle of wine?

35:28.942 --> 35:31.110
Well, that depends
on my mood, yes.

35:31.578 --> 35:32.980
Uh-huh.

35:33.013 --> 35:35.248
Maybe you have
a drinking problem?

35:37.784 --> 35:39.152
Excuse me, d-do you...

35:39.185 --> 35:41.822
do you always dress
like this, uh, every night?

35:41.855 --> 35:43.690
Depends on my mood.

35:43.723 --> 35:45.692
You maybe have a romance problem.

35:45.725 --> 35:48.094
But I'm here to administer
some first aid

35:48.127 --> 35:51.063
by means of this great bottle
of wine from Bordeaux.

35:51.096 --> 35:54.234
There's a hill,
it's a very shady hill,

35:54.266 --> 35:55.969
where this wine grows,

35:56.002 --> 35:59.438
and the winemaker, he picks them
himself for estate bottling

35:59.471 --> 36:01.307
and sometimes they escape,

36:01.340 --> 36:03.009
and I have this rare bottle.

36:03.043 --> 36:06.914
And that's what the cashier at
the drugstore told me, anyway.

36:07.380 --> 36:09.750
Oh, okay. One glass.

36:10.482 --> 36:11.751
One glass.

36:16.389 --> 36:17.958
With the door open.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.362
Well, Arlene, um,
she had kind of a weak heart.

36:23.395 --> 36:24.931
And, um...

36:24.964 --> 36:27.000
when our youngest
got killed in Iraq...

36:29.302 --> 36:32.239
that was one, I guess,
she couldn't quite handle, and, um...

36:32.272 --> 36:36.409
I took care of her
as well I could till she passed.

36:36.442 --> 36:37.477
And, uh...

36:38.679 --> 36:43.350
since most of my old friends
had already left the building...

36:43.382 --> 36:45.585
...so I decided,
"Hey, what the heck?

36:45.618 --> 36:49.221
I'll just join some community,"
you know, do something.

36:49.255 --> 36:50.291
Hmm.

36:51.391 --> 36:52.826
What about your house?

36:52.859 --> 36:54.828
Well, I sold that, um...

36:56.061 --> 37:00.433
It didn't seem like a house
or a home without Arlene.

37:00.467 --> 37:01.702
Sold it.

37:04.471 --> 37:06.072
I miss my home.

37:07.574 --> 37:09.042
And now I just found out

37:09.074 --> 37:11.444
it's gonna take even longer
before it's ready.

37:11.478 --> 37:13.246
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:14.179 --> 37:17.250
Well, actually, selfishly,
I'm really not

37:17.282 --> 37:20.554
because, uh, I don't have to
break in a new flower partner.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.391
Um, a little... a little more?

37:26.092 --> 37:28.395
No, thanks.
One is enough for me.

37:28.427 --> 37:30.596
Okay, well then, I'll, um...

37:30.630 --> 37:33.500
I'll just leave you the medicine
in case there's a setback.

37:35.701 --> 37:37.703
Listen, I-I was just thinking

37:37.737 --> 37:40.407
there's this tai chi class
in the morning

37:40.440 --> 37:44.744
and perhaps, uh, maybe,
you know, you wanna

37:44.777 --> 37:46.812
- come with me, maybe?
- No, thanks a lot.

37:46.846 --> 37:48.081
Good night, Dan.

37:48.781 --> 37:50.183
Oh, yes.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.853
- Good night.
- Good night. Thank you.

37:56.389 --> 37:57.958
Oh!

38:16.375 --> 38:17.743
Hi.

38:17.777 --> 38:20.213
Oh! Did we miss a party?

38:20.246 --> 38:22.449
Wh...
Why are you here?

38:22.482 --> 38:25.819
We're here because last night
I had a dose of courage.

38:25.851 --> 38:28.221
Uh, some of us call it
three glasses of wine.

38:28.253 --> 38:29.755
She said she'd leave the group

38:29.788 --> 38:31.257
if you couldn't stay on
as her partner.

38:32.058 --> 38:34.061
Bottom line is
you are a great player.

38:34.094 --> 38:36.362
We could win tournaments
and prizes

38:36.395 --> 38:37.763
and maybe a trip to Vegas

38:37.797 --> 38:40.801
to see that show
with those naked Australian men.

38:40.833 --> 38:43.002
Aw, come on, be one of us.

38:43.036 --> 38:45.304
Well, who ever said
I wanted to be one of you?

38:45.337 --> 38:46.305
Why wouldn't you?

38:47.040 --> 38:49.643
We stick together.
We sit together.

38:49.676 --> 38:51.511
We don't take crap from anyone.

38:51.543 --> 38:53.379
- We are the cool ones.
- Mmm.

38:53.413 --> 38:55.849
Do you have a dance number
to go with this?

38:55.882 --> 38:57.417
What are you saying?

38:57.449 --> 39:00.052
Uh, I've never
thought of myself as cool.

39:00.085 --> 39:02.354
You're not.
With us, you will be.

39:02.388 --> 39:04.790
Yeah, well, I don't like
to be rude to people.

39:04.824 --> 39:07.027
We're not rude,
we're honest.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.994
No, we're honest. You're rude.

39:09.027 --> 39:11.330
So, what do you say?
Will you join us?

39:14.167 --> 39:16.136
Well...
...I guess.

39:16.168 --> 39:17.369
Yay!

39:17.402 --> 39:18.605
On a trial basis.

39:18.638 --> 39:20.507
Yeah, well, you're on trial
with me too, lady.

39:25.911 --> 39:27.747
I think I'm done.

39:30.850 --> 39:32.918
Oh, my gosh,
I-I completely forgot,

39:32.951 --> 39:34.821
I-I brought you something.

39:37.623 --> 39:38.826
And...

39:39.458 --> 39:41.494
I, uh, I hope you like it.

39:44.496 --> 39:46.100
<i>The House of Belonging?</i>

39:47.366 --> 39:48.935
You like poetry?

39:48.967 --> 39:51.038
Well, actually, yes, I do.

39:51.670 --> 39:53.005
Who's your favorite poet?

39:53.038 --> 39:55.007
This guy right here,
David Whyte.

39:55.808 --> 39:57.243
- Huh.
- See how you like him.

39:58.645 --> 40:00.480
- I will.
- Good, good.

40:01.281 --> 40:02.715
Thanks.

40:02.748 --> 40:06.218
Listen, um, not for nothin',

40:06.252 --> 40:11.725
but tonight they have
this, uh, formal dinner thing.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.058
It's a dinner.

40:13.092 --> 40:14.828
Hold, hold... I said "dinner."

40:14.860 --> 40:16.996
I didn't say "date."
I said "dinner."

40:17.529 --> 40:18.564
Difference.

40:18.598 --> 40:20.567
And you and I could go,

40:20.600 --> 40:23.036
and we could talk about poetry.

40:26.940 --> 40:29.876
Ah, winning is such fun.

40:29.909 --> 40:31.612
I have never been
much of a winner.

40:32.277 --> 40:34.647
Well, I like to think I won

40:34.681 --> 40:36.516
when I married my Robert.

40:36.549 --> 40:37.784
Yeah.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.953
And ten years later,
he dumps you for a man.

40:40.987 --> 40:44.157
Uh, my husbands never dumped me.

40:44.190 --> 40:46.894
I made sure
that I dumped them first.

40:47.627 --> 40:49.096
- How many were there?
- Five.

40:50.163 --> 40:52.365
And thank goodness,
the last two had money.

40:52.397 --> 40:57.270
Word on the wheelchair ramps
is that you and Dan are an item.

40:58.170 --> 40:59.839
That's ridiculous.

40:59.873 --> 41:02.609
Well, everybody's jealous.
That's all that matters.

41:02.641 --> 41:05.946
Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna
ask you to share him.

41:05.978 --> 41:07.547
There's nothin' to share!

41:07.580 --> 41:09.282
Margot, what about Arthur?

41:09.315 --> 41:12.985
Oh, our schedule
is three nights a week,

41:13.018 --> 41:15.154
and tonight just happens to be
one of the nights.

41:15.188 --> 41:17.424
He will be with me
at the formal dinner.

41:17.456 --> 41:18.491
Ooh.

41:18.523 --> 41:20.092
- Are you bringing someone, Janet?
- No.

41:20.125 --> 41:22.027
Why don't you ask someone?

41:22.060 --> 41:23.429
Why don't you butt out?

41:27.900 --> 41:29.136
I, um...

41:30.670 --> 41:32.172
My cancer is back.

41:32.705 --> 41:35.308
Oh, no. How do you know?

41:35.340 --> 41:38.377
I visited my doctor yesterday.

41:38.411 --> 41:40.580
Oh, Sally, cancer?

41:40.612 --> 41:41.915
Cervical.

41:41.947 --> 41:43.984
But I beat it once before, so...

41:44.016 --> 41:45.918
Are we playing cards or what?

41:46.585 --> 41:48.589
What is wrong with you?

41:51.958 --> 41:53.226
Could I steal one of these?

41:53.259 --> 41:54.561
- Well, of course!
- Thank you.

41:54.594 --> 41:57.063
Oh, uh, have you spoken
with your daughter?

41:57.096 --> 41:58.998
You know, she might be
interested in hearing

41:59.031 --> 42:00.399
how much
you're enjoying it here.

42:00.433 --> 42:02.302
Well, if she's interested,

42:02.335 --> 42:05.405
she's perfectly welcome to come
here and find out for herself.

42:05.438 --> 42:07.541
Oh, what's Sally Hanson's
apartment?

42:21.119 --> 42:23.290
I'm coming.

42:27.659 --> 42:29.395
- Hello.
- Oh.

42:29.429 --> 42:31.598
That's a wow.
I mean, gee-whiz.

42:31.630 --> 42:35.467
Wow, you
look, um, unbelievable.

42:35.500 --> 42:38.337
I'm... I'm just gonna get my wrap
and I'll be ready.

42:41.741 --> 42:44.378
Um, I, um...

42:45.277 --> 42:46.913
I got this for you.

42:46.946 --> 42:48.447
Well, that's sweet.

42:51.951 --> 42:54.219
That's beautiful.

42:54.252 --> 42:58.357
Oh, where did you get this?

42:58.391 --> 43:01.194
Oh, I didn't get it.
I... I-I made it.

43:01.828 --> 43:03.263
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:03.929 --> 43:06.299
That is so beautiful.
Thank you.

43:06.331 --> 43:09.603
Well... it's beautiful
for a very beautiful person.

43:10.636 --> 43:13.505
You know, um, I must tell you,
the other night,

43:13.538 --> 43:17.109
I was in my place,
and I looked out the window.

43:17.143 --> 43:20.547
I looked up, and there you were
in your window.

43:20.580 --> 43:24.284
And it was beautifully lit,
and you looked beautiful.

43:24.317 --> 43:27.353
And then you started to, uh,
to dance.

43:27.386 --> 43:29.621
And, my God, I've never seen
anything like it.

43:29.654 --> 43:31.190
It was just magical.

43:31.223 --> 43:32.458
Wait a minute.

43:32.491 --> 43:33.959
This wouldn't happen to be
the night

43:33.993 --> 43:36.795
that you were
walking down the hall

43:36.828 --> 43:39.498
with a bottle of wine,
would it?

43:39.531 --> 43:40.799
Um...

43:40.833 --> 43:44.104
I think it probably
would be a good guess, yes.

43:46.438 --> 43:47.773
I, uh...

43:47.806 --> 43:50.476
The dancing is the thing
that really got me though.

43:50.509 --> 43:54.346
I mean, the way you move.
I've always wanted to dance.

43:54.380 --> 43:56.683
But, uh, I have two left feet.

43:57.784 --> 43:59.252
Would you like to learn?

43:59.284 --> 44:01.154
Are you kidding?
Of course I would.

44:01.186 --> 44:03.623
Okay. I'll teach you.

44:04.424 --> 44:06.393
- All right.
- What are we doing?

44:06.426 --> 44:09.929
You're gonna start with
your left foot coming forward.

44:09.962 --> 44:10.996
- One question.
- Yeah?

44:11.029 --> 44:12.631
Is this my left?

44:12.665 --> 44:16.735
- Okay, okay.
- Just... come this way.

44:16.768 --> 44:17.837
- One.
- One.

44:17.869 --> 44:19.105
And over here, two.

44:19.138 --> 44:20.306
Bring it together.

44:20.339 --> 44:22.976
And then back
with your right foot,

44:23.009 --> 44:24.978
and your left foot.

44:25.011 --> 44:30.016
One, two, three and four.

44:30.049 --> 44:31.284
- It's like a box.
- Yeah!

44:31.317 --> 44:32.952
That's how
they call it "box step".

44:32.985 --> 44:34.354
Oh.

44:34.386 --> 44:37.156
- One, two...
- You're dancing.

44:37.190 --> 44:39.525
- ...three and...
- What happened?

44:39.558 --> 44:41.127
I was pretty hopeless
right there.

44:41.159 --> 44:43.295
No, you're not.
You just have two left feet.

44:43.328 --> 44:44.930
Well, I do have two left feet.

44:44.964 --> 44:47.167
- Should we go to dinner?
- Um...

44:47.199 --> 44:49.368
Honestly, I'd... I'd...

44:49.402 --> 44:53.639
I'd much rather stay here
and take dancing lessons.

44:54.373 --> 44:56.176
- Really?
- Really.

44:56.208 --> 44:58.277
Okay, I'll teach you
how to lead.

44:58.310 --> 45:00.412
That's, uh,
the man's job, correct?

45:00.446 --> 45:02.949
Yeah, uh,
after he's learned how to dance.

45:02.982 --> 45:04.317
- Ah, okay.
- Okay.

45:04.350 --> 45:06.286
So now I'm being the man.

45:06.319 --> 45:07.587
You're being the woman.
You ready?

45:07.619 --> 45:09.288
That's hard to believe,
but go ahead.

45:09.322 --> 45:11.324
- Okay, come this way.
- Oh, you're tapping me.

45:11.357 --> 45:15.795
One and two
and three and four.

45:16.628 --> 45:18.464
See how I'm leading you
with my hand?

45:18.498 --> 45:21.168
Ooh, you're so masculine.

45:22.067 --> 45:23.770
See, it's not so hard.

45:27.973 --> 45:29.942
- Oops.
- That's my toe.

45:29.976 --> 45:31.711
That's my toe.

46:06.978 --> 46:08.681
He is tenacious.

46:17.190 --> 46:18.725
Sally!

46:19.424 --> 46:21.894
Helen, I'm a wreck.

46:22.694 --> 46:25.030
- I'm freakin' out.
- Why, honey?

46:25.063 --> 46:27.366
Janet says, "Be brave."

46:27.400 --> 46:30.737
The doctor says
the prognosis is good...

46:31.904 --> 46:33.340
but I'm a wreck.

46:33.873 --> 46:35.141
Four years in remission,

46:35.174 --> 46:38.411
and two weeks ago,
I get this nagging pain.

46:38.444 --> 46:40.779
I don't know wh...

46:45.817 --> 46:46.752
But...

46:46.786 --> 46:50.157
but we have got to live
every day.

46:51.824 --> 46:53.359
Mmm.

46:53.391 --> 46:56.395
Marijuana. Totally almost legal.

46:56.429 --> 46:57.997
I got it from an orderly.

46:58.029 --> 46:59.732
Oh, good lord!

47:00.465 --> 47:03.802
You wanna get baked?

47:05.938 --> 47:09.476
Charlie and I used to get high
back in the day.

47:10.810 --> 47:14.047
Actually, in the '60s,
it was just about every day.

47:14.080 --> 47:16.382
Oh! Were you a hippie?

47:17.148 --> 47:18.717
No, not exactly a hippie,

47:18.750 --> 47:21.920
although I spent an awful
lot of time in the street,

47:21.953 --> 47:26.191
protesting,
trying to change the world.

47:26.225 --> 47:28.560
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

47:28.594 --> 47:31.864
So what's going on
with you and Dan?

47:33.933 --> 47:36.002
I like Dan, I do,

47:36.034 --> 47:37.369
but, you know,

47:37.402 --> 47:40.872
I find myself a little reluctant
to get closer

47:40.906 --> 47:45.378
because, well, I haven't dated
anyone since JFK so...

47:45.411 --> 47:47.046
You dated JFK?

47:47.078 --> 47:48.814
No!

47:48.848 --> 47:50.750
No. That era.

47:53.351 --> 47:54.786
Stop it!

47:58.023 --> 47:59.859
- You know what I hate?
- What?

48:00.960 --> 48:03.597
- Sweaty underboobs.
- Ew!

48:05.498 --> 48:08.735
Oh, I used to love my boobs.

48:08.768 --> 48:10.770
I mean, they were
so nice and high.

48:12.103 --> 48:14.339
Uh-huh. Now they're
at their final resting place.

48:14.373 --> 48:16.810
Oh, God!

48:19.244 --> 48:20.947
You don't have
sweaty underboobs?

48:20.980 --> 48:22.282
No!

48:22.315 --> 48:24.617
And if I did,
I wouldn't talk about it.

48:24.650 --> 48:27.920
Oh, but they're
just so uncomfortable.

48:27.953 --> 48:29.355
Oh, God!

48:29.388 --> 48:31.090
I mean, you just can't wipe 'em
and dry 'em off.

48:31.123 --> 48:33.726
You know,
you've got to lift 'em and...

48:33.759 --> 48:36.963
and get under there
and make a proper mop-up.

48:36.996 --> 48:40.833
Then you have to hold 'em up
so you can cool 'em off.

48:42.168 --> 48:44.304
Stop, stop!

48:49.074 --> 48:52.210
So... So I got me a Ta-Ta Towel.

48:52.243 --> 48:55.881
N-No, no. I don't wanna know
what a Ta-Ta Towel is.

48:55.915 --> 48:57.717
- Ta-Ta Towel...
- Don't tell me.

48:57.750 --> 49:02.088
You wrap it around your neck
when you don't wear your bra

49:02.121 --> 49:03.623
and it holds up your boobs

49:03.656 --> 49:06.759
so you can get up under there,
let 'em dry.

49:06.792 --> 49:08.895
And... And it's adjustable!

49:08.927 --> 49:11.897
- Well, yeah, it'd have to be.
- Yes!

49:11.931 --> 49:14.467
Keep 'em high,
you keep 'em dry!

49:14.500 --> 49:16.601
Go ahead.

49:16.634 --> 49:17.670
Oh.

49:18.503 --> 49:21.574
- Ah.
- Oh, Lord Jesus.

49:21.607 --> 49:25.411
What? Uh, I can't get the...
Oh, there it is.

49:25.444 --> 49:26.612
Oh, God!

49:26.645 --> 49:28.547
- What?
- What? Is this...

49:28.581 --> 49:30.350
Is this making
your hair fall out?

49:30.382 --> 49:32.618
No! This isn't my real hair.

49:32.650 --> 49:35.554
- Whose is it?
- It's not real hair.

49:35.587 --> 49:37.956
Y-Yeah, but how
did it get in there?

49:37.989 --> 49:40.359
You can weave it in,
you can clip it in,

49:40.393 --> 49:41.661
you can braid it in,

49:41.694 --> 49:44.330
you just can put it in
as much as you want.

49:44.362 --> 49:45.998
I see. Can you sew it in?

49:46.031 --> 49:48.634
Yeah, I can sew it in
if I want to sew it in.

49:48.667 --> 49:51.804
But, listen, don't you worry
about my hair, all right?

49:51.837 --> 49:54.907
Because I come from
a long line of beauticians.

49:55.840 --> 49:59.112
My mother, she had
a hair salon in the garage,

49:59.145 --> 50:02.482
and I learned how to do
all kind of ladies' hair.

50:02.514 --> 50:04.783
So I can sew this in tomorrow...

50:04.817 --> 50:06.452
- Well, that's good.
- ...if I need to.

50:06.485 --> 50:08.755
I'm glad to hear that.

50:13.092 --> 50:15.027
- Oh.
- Oh, God!

50:20.366 --> 50:21.634
You know...

50:22.567 --> 50:24.569
I'm here for you,
you know that?

50:24.603 --> 50:26.773
- Aw.
- Whatever you need.

50:34.779 --> 50:36.982
Go, go, go, go.
Oh, go, go.

50:56.268 --> 50:57.436
D-Did...

50:57.469 --> 51:00.439
Did we s-sleep together
last night?

51:01.339 --> 51:03.074
Oh, don't look
so worried.

51:03.107 --> 51:05.844
That kind of experience
is not on my bucket list.

51:05.877 --> 51:09.314
- Oh!
- I wonder what time it is.

51:09.348 --> 51:11.717
Where's my...

51:15.186 --> 51:16.989
Oh, God.

51:17.022 --> 51:20.592
We missed the power walk,
and we missed aquatics.

51:20.625 --> 51:22.661
We slept through
that whistle?

51:23.596 --> 51:24.964
Maybe we're dead.

51:27.199 --> 51:31.204
Besides, Janet
isn't the boss of us.

51:31.237 --> 51:36.509
And what's... what's with
that fitness obsession of hers?

51:36.542 --> 51:39.344
It keeps
the Grim Reaper away.

51:39.377 --> 51:45.016
But, you know...
...she won't, she can't...

51:45.049 --> 51:47.786
she can't deal with anything
that has to do with weakness

51:47.819 --> 51:50.822
or death or... or disease.

51:50.855 --> 51:53.625
She denies.
Deny, deny.

51:53.659 --> 51:56.729
- Never talks about anything personal.
- Mmm.

51:56.761 --> 52:00.600
I read being rude can
prolong a person's life.

52:00.632 --> 52:05.036
Oh, well, then she's gonna live
to be a thousand years old.

52:09.308 --> 52:10.543
Two hearts.

52:11.643 --> 52:13.044
Double.

52:13.078 --> 52:14.647
Three hearts.

52:18.384 --> 52:20.219
I don't like sharing Arthur.

52:21.119 --> 52:22.321
There, I said it.

52:22.353 --> 52:23.723
Finally.

52:23.755 --> 52:27.592
Dump him and that stupid
hedgehog on his head.

52:27.625 --> 52:30.795
I don't wanna dump him.
I really like him.

52:30.828 --> 52:32.464
Then talk to him about it.

52:32.498 --> 52:35.735
You know, open communication.
It's the only way.

52:35.768 --> 52:37.737
Yes, but I'm really...
I'm worried about him

52:37.770 --> 52:41.373
because last night
he called me "Geraldine" again.

52:41.406 --> 52:42.841
That's...

52:42.875 --> 52:46.679
That was his wife's name,
and she died in 1992.

52:49.949 --> 52:53.052
So... how are you
and Dan doing?

52:53.085 --> 52:56.121
Oh, we're friends, really.

52:56.154 --> 52:57.923
- We are.
- Mmm.

52:57.956 --> 52:59.725
And you.
How are you feeling?

52:59.757 --> 53:02.962
Can we focus
on the damn game?

53:04.996 --> 53:06.898
Actually... I'm done.

53:06.931 --> 53:09.534
- Me, too.
- So am I.

53:09.567 --> 53:11.403
Shall we go for a walk?

53:11.436 --> 53:13.438
- Sounds good.
- Yes.

53:13.471 --> 53:15.607
Janet,
you coming with us?

53:26.051 --> 53:27.753
- Cane Fu!
- Fu!

53:28.621 --> 53:30.723
- And again, Cane Fu.
- Fu!

53:30.755 --> 53:32.991
Great. Here we go!

53:33.025 --> 53:35.828
- Come on, everyone. Cane Fu!
- Fu!

53:35.860 --> 53:37.462
- Peter, hi.
- Hi.

53:37.496 --> 53:41.167
Your grandmother looks so forward
to your visits every week.

53:41.199 --> 53:44.869
- She was sad she missed tea with you last Thursday.
- Me too.

53:44.902 --> 53:47.505
- I got called into work. But I called her.
- Yeah.

53:47.538 --> 53:49.274
You know, we love
your grandmother.

53:49.308 --> 53:51.643
A few of us got together and wanted
to do something special for her

53:51.677 --> 53:53.913
- before she leaves.
- Oh.

53:53.946 --> 53:55.648
But we wanted
to include your mom.

53:55.681 --> 53:59.719
- Is it okay if you give me her number?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

54:05.623 --> 54:07.859
Hi, this is Laura.
How can I help you?

54:07.893 --> 54:11.764
<i>This is Pine
Grove calling about your mom.</i>

54:13.031 --> 54:17.869
"Good friends, good books
and a sleepy conscience."

54:17.902 --> 54:19.705
"This is the ideal life."

54:20.172 --> 54:21.940
Mark Twain.

54:21.973 --> 54:25.310
Do you remember every quote
I ever taught you?

54:25.344 --> 54:26.979
Just about.

54:27.011 --> 54:28.913
- Okay, Grandma, I've gotta go to work.
- All right, honey.

54:28.947 --> 54:31.917
- Thank you so much for all of this.
- You're welcome.

54:31.949 --> 54:33.919
- Wonderful.
- Oh!

54:35.154 --> 54:37.090
Mom, um...

54:37.656 --> 54:38.958
Mom wanted me to tell you

54:38.991 --> 54:41.560
that the contractor
found termites,

54:41.592 --> 54:43.763
so it could take
another week or two.

54:43.795 --> 54:46.098
Oh, that's okay.

54:48.167 --> 54:49.969
Did you just say
"That's okay"?

54:53.572 --> 54:55.741
Yes, I did.

54:55.773 --> 54:57.777
Balance.

54:57.810 --> 54:59.712
Left foot, balance.
Good.

54:59.744 --> 55:01.913
And up. Excellent.

55:02.547 --> 55:04.183
Mmm.

55:04.215 --> 55:06.152
Did you like that?

55:06.185 --> 55:09.087
Ah!

55:09.121 --> 55:10.423
Okay.

55:10.456 --> 55:12.925
Laura!
Wh-What are you doing?

55:12.958 --> 55:15.728
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting a massage.

55:15.761 --> 55:18.898
- Is that all?
- Y-Yeah, that's all.

55:18.931 --> 55:20.933
- Why are you here?
- Should I go?

55:20.965 --> 55:22.868
- Yes.
- No! Wh-What's going on?

55:22.900 --> 55:25.003
I came here to talk
some sense into you

55:25.036 --> 55:27.138
about your relationship
with Dan Simpson

55:27.172 --> 55:30.476
and to find out why you've
been behaving so badly.

55:31.375 --> 55:33.745
Where are you getting
all this bad information?

55:33.779 --> 55:35.915
- It doesn't matter.
- Well, it does to me!

55:35.947 --> 55:37.917
- What would Dad think?
- About what?

55:37.949 --> 55:40.252
About you screwing around
with Dan Simpson.

55:40.284 --> 55:42.187
I am not screwing around
with D...

55:42.221 --> 55:44.156
W-We're friends,
that's all.

55:44.188 --> 55:46.391
For God's sakes,
I'm not dating anyone.

55:46.424 --> 55:49.194
And if I... if I were,
it wouldn't be any of your business.

55:49.228 --> 55:52.598
Please stop trying
to manage my life.

55:52.630 --> 55:54.366
God's sakes!

56:00.639 --> 56:02.008
Shiatsu?

56:04.842 --> 56:07.145
Hey, Mom!

56:13.851 --> 56:15.654
What's goin' on?

56:15.686 --> 56:17.956
Guess who I went
to visit today?

56:17.989 --> 56:19.257
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:19.290 --> 56:21.259
Well, I got a call
that she was miserable,

56:21.293 --> 56:23.696
that she hated the place and she
blamed me for putting her in there.

56:23.728 --> 56:25.697
- So I went.
- And?

56:25.730 --> 56:27.732
And...
it was awful.

56:27.766 --> 56:30.869
I don't get it. She seemed so
happy when I was there today.

56:30.902 --> 56:32.871
Like she's
really enjoying herself.

56:32.904 --> 56:35.073
Oh, there's so much
that you don't know.

56:35.107 --> 56:37.509
Okay, Mom, well, you know,
here's what I do know.

56:37.543 --> 56:40.346
She still thinks you were gonna
try to force her out of her home

56:40.378 --> 56:41.846
when Grandpa died.

56:41.880 --> 56:44.083
- So you're on her side now?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

56:44.116 --> 56:46.719
- You're obviously on her side.
- I'm not on anyone's side. Listen to me.

56:46.752 --> 56:49.922
You asked her to try Pine Grove
while the house is being fixed

56:49.955 --> 56:51.257
and I supported you.

56:51.290 --> 56:53.893
You were here and saw
how terrified she was

56:53.926 --> 56:55.994
that she'd be uncomfortable
and feel unsafe.

56:56.027 --> 56:59.297
And yet she risked something,
and I love her for it.

56:59.331 --> 57:01.100
Maybe you should
risk something

57:01.132 --> 57:04.203
and just try talking to her
once without criticizing her.

57:12.177 --> 57:13.212
Wow!

57:14.378 --> 57:15.848
Hello, dear.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.784
What are you doing here?

57:19.585 --> 57:21.554
I need to talk to you.

57:21.587 --> 57:24.190
Oh... uh...

57:24.223 --> 57:26.324
let's go to your place.

57:26.357 --> 57:29.060
- That's... what we always do.
- Okay.

57:29.094 --> 57:33.132
But before we go,
what's my name?

57:33.165 --> 57:35.268
You don't know
your name?

57:37.235 --> 57:39.071
I'm asking if you do.

57:39.103 --> 57:42.707
That's a silly question.

57:42.741 --> 57:44.811
Of course I do.

57:45.944 --> 57:47.446
Then what is it?

57:55.753 --> 57:57.255
I-I...

58:52.377 --> 58:54.080
Oh.

59:02.087 --> 59:04.188
Oh, Arthur.

59:04.221 --> 59:06.424
My name is Margot.

59:08.759 --> 59:10.295
It's Margot.

59:59.710 --> 01:00:00.946
Bye.

01:00:01.645 --> 01:00:02.714
See you.

01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:25.069
Hey, what's up?

01:00:25.103 --> 01:00:27.206
I've got chocolate truffles
and merlot.

01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:29.342
Wanna take a walk
on the wild side?

01:00:30.808 --> 01:00:33.044
Let's go crazy.

01:00:33.078 --> 01:00:34.612
I mean,
I hate to admit it,

01:00:34.645 --> 01:00:39.351
but I-I do find myself thinking
about him all the time.

01:00:40.185 --> 01:00:43.154
And when I see him,
my pulse starts racing

01:00:43.188 --> 01:00:46.125
like I just ran up
three flights of stairs.

01:00:46.157 --> 01:00:48.761
You can run up three flights
of stairs?

01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:53.866
I mean, Charlie will always
be my heart and soul,

01:00:53.898 --> 01:00:57.301
but I have to admit

01:00:57.335 --> 01:00:59.804
Dan is becoming
pretty special to me.

01:00:59.837 --> 01:01:01.606
I don't know what to do.

01:01:01.639 --> 01:01:05.944
Well, I say enjoy Dan.
It doesn't make Charlie any less special.

01:01:05.976 --> 01:01:07.980
You'll always have that.

01:01:08.013 --> 01:01:10.081
And if it works out
with Dan, great.

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:14.119
If it doesn't, at least
you're ridin' the bike again.

01:01:15.987 --> 01:01:19.491
And in this metaphor,
Dan is the bike?

01:01:19.523 --> 01:01:21.393
Yes, he is.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.163
I'm gonna need a helmet.

01:01:37.641 --> 01:01:39.744
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

01:01:39.777 --> 01:01:41.112
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:01:41.145 --> 01:01:43.614
Well, I will be when
we get this settled.

01:01:43.647 --> 01:01:45.116
Get what settled?

01:01:45.683 --> 01:01:46.551
The rules.

01:01:46.585 --> 01:01:48.619
- What... What rules?
- For dating.

01:01:48.652 --> 01:01:51.790
Neither of us have done
this for a-a long time,

01:01:51.822 --> 01:01:54.960
so, you know,
I-I just made up a list of rul...

01:01:54.993 --> 01:01:56.828
Well, they're not rules, really,
they're questions.

01:01:56.862 --> 01:02:00.398
Just, you know, to help us
set some parameters.

01:02:00.431 --> 01:02:03.000
Like, for instance,
do we tell people?

01:02:03.034 --> 01:02:08.740
Or... Or do, you know, they just see us
holding hands and fill in the blanks?

01:02:08.772 --> 01:02:10.608
Or do we kiss in public?

01:02:10.641 --> 01:02:12.643
Or is that too much?
I don't know. Is...

01:02:12.677 --> 01:02:14.447
Well, let me see.

01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:31.362
Uh, we'll just, um...
we, um...

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:35.100
We make it up
as we go along.

01:02:35.132 --> 01:02:36.400
Okay.

01:02:36.433 --> 01:02:38.670
We'll try it your way.

01:02:42.574 --> 01:02:45.878
You know, the other day,
somebody from here contacted my daughter

01:02:45.911 --> 01:02:47.546
and told her lies
about me.

01:02:47.578 --> 01:02:49.247
Who would do that?

01:02:49.281 --> 01:02:50.349
- I don't know.
- I can't belie...

01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:51.850
Oh, that's terrible.

01:02:51.882 --> 01:02:54.118
You better believe I'm
gonna find out who it is.

01:02:54.152 --> 01:02:57.188
- Well, let us know what we can do to help.
- I sure will.

01:02:57.221 --> 01:02:59.690
- Oh! And...
- Yes?

01:02:59.723 --> 01:03:01.993
Dan and I
are dating officially.

01:03:02.027 --> 01:03:03.695
Yes! Finally!

01:03:03.728 --> 01:03:04.996
Okay, ladies.

01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:07.565
- What?
- Talking is not walking.

01:03:07.598 --> 01:03:11.002
- What's with Grumpy?
- Saturday is her birthday.

01:03:11.036 --> 01:03:12.771
She's been telling us
for the last three years

01:03:12.804 --> 01:03:14.873
that she meets her son
and his family

01:03:14.906 --> 01:03:17.842
at their favorite Chinese
restaurant to celebrate.

01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:19.177
Hmm.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:22.147
But every year,
she goes and eats alone.

01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:24.649
- Oh, that's awful.
- Yeah, I know.

01:03:26.051 --> 01:03:27.286
Yeah?

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:33.558
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm... I'm Peter.

01:03:33.592 --> 01:03:35.460
- Oh.
- I'm Helen's grandson.

01:03:35.493 --> 01:03:38.429
- Yeah. I've heard a lot about you.
- I've heard a lot about you too.

01:03:38.462 --> 01:03:40.464
Listen,
I really need to talk to you.

01:03:40.498 --> 01:03:42.368
You need
to talk to me?

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.037
- Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you.
- That's okay.

01:03:46.071 --> 01:03:48.639
Listen, your timing couldn't
be any more perfect.

01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:51.909
She's on her power walk, you know.
That'll take a while.

01:03:51.942 --> 01:03:57.482
So... you and Grandma are...
dating?

01:03:58.817 --> 01:04:00.985
Yes, yes, we are.

01:04:01.018 --> 01:04:02.353
And, uh...

01:04:02.386 --> 01:04:04.022
No, no,
it's cool, it's cool.

01:04:04.054 --> 01:04:06.924
It's just,
uh, I-I think...

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:10.262
I think there are some things
you should know about her.

01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:16.534
Well, there's no doubt that
Helen is your grandmother.

01:04:17.302 --> 01:04:18.670
Um...

01:04:18.703 --> 01:04:20.772
Okay, she loves
ballroom dancing.

01:04:20.804 --> 01:04:21.839
Mm-hmm.

01:04:21.873 --> 01:04:23.909
And she doesn't
like clutter at all.

01:04:23.942 --> 01:04:25.476
Yeah.

01:04:25.509 --> 01:04:27.245
She can be
a little forgetful,

01:04:27.279 --> 01:04:29.047
but that's what
makes her charming.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.451
- Mm-hmm.
- She loves famous quotes. She's a big fan of famous qu...

01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:35.554
I really get it.
I mean, truly.

01:04:35.587 --> 01:04:38.290
I know that you love her
very much, right?

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:41.627
Yeah, I really do.

01:04:41.659 --> 01:04:45.364
I mean, she's the most genuine
person I've ever known.

01:04:45.397 --> 01:04:48.567
Um, but sh...

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.335
she has a life,
you have to understand,

01:04:51.368 --> 01:04:54.772
outside...
outside of your family, right?

01:04:54.806 --> 01:04:59.211
And I also get the fact that
you wanna protect her, you know.

01:04:59.243 --> 01:05:01.946
But I promise you

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.516
that I will try
my very best to be there

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:07.253
for every one
of those moments, okay?

01:05:09.587 --> 01:05:11.690
Then we're good.

01:05:15.627 --> 01:05:18.330
- Take a breath.
- Listen, I gotta tell her.

01:05:18.362 --> 01:05:19.730
It's going great.

01:05:19.764 --> 01:05:21.767
I just can't
do this anymore.

01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:24.268
I have a signed contract
that says you will.

01:05:24.302 --> 01:05:25.837
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

01:05:25.869 --> 01:05:29.040
It means I need you to do
the job I hired you to do.

01:05:29.074 --> 01:05:33.646
And I'm pretty sure that you
wouldn't want Helen to see this.

01:05:34.645 --> 01:05:36.681
Why would you wanna do
a thing like that?

01:05:36.714 --> 01:05:38.816
- You can't threaten me.
- Why not?

01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.321
All right.
Just breathe, Dan, breathe.

01:05:42.353 --> 01:05:44.022
Go to yoga.

01:05:49.993 --> 01:05:51.762
All right.

01:05:51.795 --> 01:05:53.698
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:54.465 --> 01:05:55.768
Uh-huh.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.922
Janet!

01:06:17.956 --> 01:06:19.191
What a surprise!

01:06:19.223 --> 01:06:22.060
We didn't know that
you would be here for lunch.

01:06:22.627 --> 01:06:24.429
Why are you all here?

01:06:24.462 --> 01:06:28.400
Helen's grandson was kind enough
to pick us up to take us to lunch,

01:06:28.433 --> 01:06:30.601
and Margot suggested
this restaurant.

01:06:30.634 --> 01:06:33.604
Oh, yes.
I love the ribs here.

01:06:33.638 --> 01:06:36.241
And, you know
I am very particular

01:06:36.273 --> 01:06:37.942
about what
I put in my body.

01:06:37.976 --> 01:06:41.246
Hard to believe
after five husbands.

01:06:41.279 --> 01:06:43.648
Where's your family?

01:06:43.681 --> 01:06:45.650
You just missed them.

01:06:45.683 --> 01:06:48.520
My son had a very important
business meeting to go to,

01:06:48.552 --> 01:06:50.888
- so he had to cut the luncheon short.
- That's too bad.

01:06:50.922 --> 01:06:54.726
As long as you've just started
eating, do you mind if we join you?

01:06:54.759 --> 01:06:57.661
- Oh, like a surprise party.
- Surprise!

01:06:57.694 --> 01:07:02.066
And then he proposed, right in
the middle of Times Square at midnight,

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.404
with all the people yelling
"Happy New Year!"

01:07:05.436 --> 01:07:07.072
- Aw.
- That's so romantic.

01:07:07.105 --> 01:07:10.007
And then we went and danced
until the sun came up.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:13.477
And you know what they
say about dancers in bed?

01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:16.715
No. What do they say?

01:07:17.781 --> 01:07:20.084
When my Robert proposed
to me on my birthday,

01:07:20.118 --> 01:07:24.221
he made me a red velvet cake
with pink icing, pink candles,

01:07:24.255 --> 01:07:28.394
and he played show tunes for me
all afternoon on the piano!

01:07:29.427 --> 01:07:31.830
How could you not know
he was gay?

01:07:31.862 --> 01:07:33.898
He didn't know,
so how was I to know?

01:07:33.931 --> 01:07:36.000
Okay, that's it for me.

01:07:36.034 --> 01:07:38.302
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

01:07:38.335 --> 01:07:40.504
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

01:07:40.538 --> 01:07:43.007
- I'm very sorry. Excuse me.
- Are you okay?

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.410
Yeah. Is he okay?

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:49.080
So did you have
a favorite husband?

01:07:51.315 --> 01:07:53.151
Number one stole my heart.

01:07:53.985 --> 01:07:57.422
He could charm the pants
off of anybody.

01:07:57.455 --> 01:07:59.424
Which was exactly the problem.

01:07:59.456 --> 01:08:01.359
- Oh!
- All right. No more sad thoughts.

01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:05.297
This is a birthday celebration.
And it's on me.

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:07.632
- Thank you.
- Where's my bag?

01:08:07.665 --> 01:08:09.835
- Mmm?
- You don't have...

01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:12.871
Did I forget it?
I'm sure I brought it in.

01:08:12.904 --> 01:08:16.908
- Just stand up. Maybe it's...
- No, it's gone.

01:08:18.977 --> 01:08:21.013
Hey!

01:08:21.912 --> 01:08:23.214
Nice bike.

01:08:23.247 --> 01:08:25.015
Oh, yeah? You like it?

01:08:25.048 --> 01:08:27.585
You know what they say. The bigger
the bike, the smaller the package.

01:08:27.618 --> 01:08:31.656
All right. Why don't you
take your wrinkly ass back inside?

01:08:31.688 --> 01:08:33.057
Give me the purse.

01:08:33.691 --> 01:08:35.727
- What purse?
- My purse.

01:08:35.759 --> 01:08:37.795
- What are you talking about?
- I'll scream.

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:40.866
After I kick you
between the <i>cojones.</i>

01:08:40.898 --> 01:08:43.267
- In the <i>cojones.</i>
- Oh, he got the i...

01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:56.814
Yes, Officer Ginty,
I hear the siren coming right now.

01:08:56.846 --> 01:09:00.118
- What is going on?
- Hey, we're the Queen Bees!

01:09:00.151 --> 01:09:02.153
We don't take crap from anyone.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.790
I wanna make a pit stop
before we go home.

01:09:06.823 --> 01:09:08.192
Where are we going?

01:09:08.225 --> 01:09:10.795
I'm feeling empowered.
I wanna go see Andrew.

01:09:10.828 --> 01:09:12.096
- Your son?
- Yeah.

01:09:12.129 --> 01:09:13.831
Are you sure that
that's a good idea?

01:09:13.865 --> 01:09:15.834
I-I thought
he was in a meeting.

01:09:15.866 --> 01:09:17.667
Oh, you're a worse liar
than I am.

01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:21.538
We all know the truth. My son is
not that interested in his mother.

01:09:21.572 --> 01:09:22.907
But I think
I want to change that.

01:09:22.941 --> 01:09:24.943
- I love that!
- Let's go.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:29.147
Hey. Can I help you?

01:09:29.179 --> 01:09:31.782
- Yeah, I'm here to see my son.
- Who's your son?

01:09:31.816 --> 01:09:34.752
- Andy... Uh, Andrew.
- Oh.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.921
What does that mean?

01:09:36.953 --> 01:09:39.790
- W-Well, it's, um, uh...
- What?

01:09:39.823 --> 01:09:41.960
Well, it's just...

01:09:41.993 --> 01:09:44.194
I thought
you had passed away.

01:09:44.227 --> 01:09:46.663
Why would you think that?

01:09:46.697 --> 01:09:49.667
Well, that's what Andy told...

01:09:55.173 --> 01:09:59.210
A-Anyway, he took the family
to DC for the weekend.

01:10:06.683 --> 01:10:08.986
No, it's a disaster.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.190
I need you to do
a monumental favor for me.

01:10:15.692 --> 01:10:18.495
Well, that was a stupid idea.

01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:21.766
I never asked for a party
and I never asked for your pity.

01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:23.701
But you had to impose yourself
like you always do.

01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:28.106
Oh, that isn't fair.
We were just trying to do something nice.

01:10:28.138 --> 01:10:30.107
- Nice? You call that nice?
- Yes.

01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:32.444
- We didn't know that your son is such an asshole.
- Oh, shut up!

01:10:32.477 --> 01:10:36.214
You know nothing about him. You're out of
the group. And you're out of the group.

01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:42.520
I asked Dan to arrange
for a surprise party for her.

01:10:42.553 --> 01:10:46.391
But that's the problem. So far only
two people have agreed to show up.

01:10:46.423 --> 01:10:49.793
- Only two? That's all?
- Well, yeah, because it's Janet.

01:10:49.826 --> 01:10:51.996
Oh, we have to
make this right.

01:10:52.829 --> 01:10:55.132
Go find Dan and ask him
what you need to do.

01:10:55.165 --> 01:10:58.035
And meet me in
the dining room in three hours.

01:10:59.337 --> 01:11:01.071
She doesn't deserve a party.

01:11:01.105 --> 01:11:03.340
She's the worst person
who's ever lived here, ever.

01:11:07.978 --> 01:11:09.681
We want vodka
in the fruit punch.

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:12.216
- All we've got is wine.
- Get vodka!

01:11:12.249 --> 01:11:14.185
No, she didn't.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.723
Ask for it. Ask for it!

01:11:18.755 --> 01:11:20.624
Will there be
cheese balls?

01:11:20.657 --> 01:11:24.428
If we're going to a party for that
cow, there better be cheese balls.

01:11:24.462 --> 01:11:26.598
There will be
cheese balls.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.968
And nuts.
I like nuts on my balls.

01:11:33.538 --> 01:11:36.241
Why are you hauling me out
like a common criminal?

01:11:36.273 --> 01:11:39.511
Regulatory Committee wants to meet
with you about several complaints.

01:11:39.544 --> 01:11:42.347
- The Regulatory Committee is a bunch of idiots.
- That's not nice.

01:11:42.379 --> 01:11:44.782
Why the hell are we going
through the dining room?

01:11:44.816 --> 01:11:46.618
Surprise!

01:11:48.252 --> 01:11:49.553
Come on up!

01:11:52.456 --> 01:11:54.392
Happy birthday.

01:12:01.264 --> 01:12:03.368
Who am I supposed to
blame for all of this?

01:12:03.868 --> 01:12:05.704
- Dan.
- Helen.

01:12:06.737 --> 01:12:09.708
- Thank you.
- Aww.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.109
- I'm out.
- Me too.

01:12:12.142 --> 01:12:14.311
- I fold.
- I raise.

01:12:14.344 --> 01:12:17.048
I'll see your 20...

01:12:18.449 --> 01:12:19.984
and...

01:12:20.017 --> 01:12:21.553
I'll raise you 20 more.

01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:27.392
I call.

01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:32.964
Okay, hot stuff,
what do ya got?

01:12:34.664 --> 01:12:37.301
Straight.

01:12:37.334 --> 01:12:39.136
Mmm.

01:12:40.004 --> 01:12:42.741
Full house.

01:12:44.075 --> 01:12:47.713
Drop 'em!

01:12:48.478 --> 01:12:49.981
Just to be clear,

01:12:50.013 --> 01:12:52.316
I have no problem doing this
for you on your birthday.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:55.719
But if you ask me again
on Monday,

01:12:55.753 --> 01:12:56.955
I'll be calling
my lawyer.

01:13:02.226 --> 01:13:04.795
- Yeah, he's packin'!
- All right!

01:13:05.829 --> 01:13:07.931
Let's play some cards,
huh?

01:13:07.964 --> 01:13:09.400
- Yay!
- Whoo!

01:13:09.432 --> 01:13:14.404
The food, drink, decorations.
How did you do it all?

01:13:14.437 --> 01:13:15.739
You're a miracle man.

01:13:15.772 --> 01:13:17.508
Of course I am.
I got you.

01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:20.779
- Helen, over here!
- Excuse me.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.249
I wanna thank all
of you for this

01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:28.686
and for putting up with
me every day and...

01:13:28.718 --> 01:13:29.987
Here's to
good friends.

01:13:30.021 --> 01:13:31.623
- Yes.
- Hear, hear.

01:13:31.655 --> 01:13:33.023
Whoo!

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:36.160
Evening, lovely ladies.

01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:40.898
Arthur!
Where's the muskrat?

01:13:40.932 --> 01:13:45.103
Oh, I figured that
people around here,

01:13:45.136 --> 01:13:48.173
they should start seeing me
a little differently.

01:13:48.205 --> 01:13:51.042
Would you like to dance,
Geraldine?

01:13:51.075 --> 01:13:53.645
I would love to dance
with you, Arthur.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.882
- Want another?
- Oh, no, I'm good.

01:13:57.914 --> 01:13:59.417
Okay.

01:14:07.325 --> 01:14:09.194
Oh, crap!

01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:13.231
Laura, It's Janet Poindexter. I made a terrible mistake. I...

01:14:13.897 --> 01:14:16.101
Oh! Oh, no.
No-no-no. No, no.

01:14:18.369 --> 01:14:20.138
You get away from her,
you phony!

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:22.139
What are you doing?
What's going on?

01:14:22.173 --> 01:14:24.442
- Ladies, everything okay?
- No, it is not.

01:14:24.475 --> 01:14:27.344
I received this in the mail.
What were you thinking?

01:14:28.445 --> 01:14:29.813
What is this?

01:14:29.847 --> 01:14:33.184
Dan, this document's about you.
Who sent you this? Ken?

01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:35.018
I didn't send it.

01:14:35.052 --> 01:14:36.821
Well, somebody has to tell me
what's going on.

01:14:36.853 --> 01:14:38.388
Okay, okay. Uh...

01:14:38.422 --> 01:14:40.959
Your daughter told me
to do everything I could

01:14:40.991 --> 01:14:42.427
to keep you happy
during your time here.

01:14:42.459 --> 01:14:45.429
You just can't
stop yourself, can you?

01:14:45.463 --> 01:14:48.766
Mom, I just wanted you
to be okay.

01:14:48.798 --> 01:14:52.736
I didn't mean this.
I swear I had nothing to do with this.

01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:54.772
What is "this"?

01:14:54.804 --> 01:14:56.673
Well, some years ago,

01:14:56.706 --> 01:15:00.143
Dan retired as a longtime activities
director for one of our competitors.

01:15:00.177 --> 01:15:04.682
After I met your daughter, I called and
asked if I could hire him temporarily,

01:15:04.714 --> 01:15:08.619
just to make sure that your
adjustment here went smoothly.

01:15:08.652 --> 01:15:10.088
And... And he said yes.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.223
So... So your job
was to make me believe

01:15:13.257 --> 01:15:16.060
that you were
really interested in me?

01:15:16.093 --> 01:15:18.263
That you really cared about me?

01:15:18.295 --> 01:15:20.664
- No.
- Oh, God.

01:15:20.697 --> 01:15:22.734
Oh, I feel like such a jerk.

01:15:22.767 --> 01:15:24.002
No, that's not it.

01:15:24.035 --> 01:15:26.671
I gave you my heart.

01:15:27.405 --> 01:15:29.974
And you pretended
to give me yours?

01:15:30.007 --> 01:15:31.976
- I-I didn't...
- What kind of a man are you?

01:15:32.008 --> 01:15:35.112
Honey, I didn't pretend to care about you.
I didn't pretend.

01:15:35.146 --> 01:15:38.182
I couldn't find a way to say it
without thinking I was gonna hurt you.

01:15:38.214 --> 01:15:39.650
And then...

01:15:39.683 --> 01:15:41.919
And then I just was afraid
that you'd walk away.

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:43.922
Yeah?
You mean like this?

01:16:01.905 --> 01:16:04.542
Help! Somebody!

01:16:04.575 --> 01:16:07.879
- Help! Somebody, help.
- Call 911!

01:16:07.911 --> 01:16:10.048
Erin, could
you help me please?

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.848
<i>Dr. Zager to CCU.</i>

01:16:11.882 --> 01:16:17.422
Oh, Janet, I'm so sorry I
ruined your party. I'm so sorry.

01:16:17.454 --> 01:16:20.691
You can't help it. You always have
to be the center of attention.

01:16:21.525 --> 01:16:26.998
Well, the doctors said
that, uh, I had a...

01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:28.999
a mild stroke

01:16:29.032 --> 01:16:34.771
and, uh, I maybe not be able

01:16:34.804 --> 01:16:36.674
to move this right arm.

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:41.178
Oh, no. How can I be
your bridge partner?

01:16:41.212 --> 01:16:44.516
That's why God gave you
a left arm, stupid.

01:16:45.648 --> 01:16:46.985
Oh, God.

01:16:47.017 --> 01:16:50.053
Three of my exes
had strokes.

01:16:50.087 --> 01:16:53.424
And, uh, one of them
still can't speak.

01:16:53.456 --> 01:16:55.293
And then
the others died.

01:16:55.325 --> 01:16:58.862
Well, apparently, you're still
here and you can't stop talking.

01:16:58.896 --> 01:17:04.201
And we are all here for you.
We are sisters, the four of us.

01:17:05.069 --> 01:17:06.471
Yes. Oh.

01:17:09.139 --> 01:17:10.542
I'm sorry, Helen.

01:17:12.142 --> 01:17:14.177
What I did was awful.
It was just awful.

01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:16.246
No one
deserves that.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.148
That's right.

01:17:18.182 --> 01:17:19.751
I'm the worst.

01:17:22.285 --> 01:17:25.690
You are a self-righteous
bitch, Janet.

01:17:28.659 --> 01:17:29.728
I know.

01:17:38.535 --> 01:17:39.636
Helen?

01:17:40.804 --> 01:17:42.272
Um, how's Margot?

01:17:43.339 --> 01:17:45.642
She's... okay.

01:17:45.676 --> 01:17:50.380
I mean, she might end up with her
right arm permanently paralyzed,

01:17:50.414 --> 01:17:54.185
but I guess that's what
passes for "okay" at this age.

01:17:54.218 --> 01:17:55.553
See you later.

01:17:55.585 --> 01:17:57.121
Listen, um...

01:17:58.155 --> 01:18:01.192
please l-let me
talk to you for a minute.

01:18:01.225 --> 01:18:03.561
Helen, please.
Just for a minute.

01:18:04.661 --> 01:18:06.998
Look.

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:08.865
When Ken first called me,

01:18:08.898 --> 01:18:14.472
he told me he was having a real rough
situation with some family matter,

01:18:14.504 --> 01:18:16.740
and he asked me
could I help.

01:18:16.773 --> 01:18:20.779
And I said, "Uh, yeah,
but just for a short while."

01:18:21.712 --> 01:18:23.248
So, what, um...

01:18:24.414 --> 01:18:25.749
I was supposed to do...

01:18:26.549 --> 01:18:30.821
was get you
from the bingo game

01:18:30.855 --> 01:18:33.124
to the bridge game...

01:18:33.156 --> 01:18:35.592
to the pool, to just...

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:37.962
Stuff like that.
Silly stuff.

01:18:37.995 --> 01:18:40.765
Just to make sure that
you were enjoying yourself.

01:18:40.798 --> 01:18:44.168
- Yeah.
- But then something happened to me.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.770
Something happened.
I don't know.

01:18:45.803 --> 01:18:47.638
I-I just got to know you.

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:49.740
I found this great
sense of humor,

01:18:49.772 --> 01:18:53.043
and just like that,
I mean, I can't explain it,

01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:54.445
but, um...

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.583
All I wanted to do
was, uh...

01:18:59.616 --> 01:19:02.320
just spend every day
with you.

01:19:02.352 --> 01:19:04.221
Just all day, every day.

01:19:04.254 --> 01:19:07.025
And, uh,
well, I guess I, uh...

01:19:07.725 --> 01:19:10.761
I was falling
in love with you.

01:19:10.794 --> 01:19:12.363
I never expected,

01:19:12.396 --> 01:19:16.468
ever, ever, to have
that feeling again, um...

01:19:17.767 --> 01:19:19.303
So, um...

01:19:21.437 --> 01:19:25.509
I-I-I need you with me
and I wanna be with you.

01:19:26.177 --> 01:19:28.545
I just can't do
without you.

01:19:29.914 --> 01:19:31.449
So, uh, um...

01:19:34.051 --> 01:19:39.022
if you don't say you'll
marry me when I come back,

01:19:39.056 --> 01:19:42.326
by God, I will not go.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.763
Is that last part
from <i>Gone With the Wind?</i>

01:19:46.797 --> 01:19:48.566
Yup.

01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:52.303
I-I've been studying
a little.

01:19:58.409 --> 01:20:01.179
You lied to me for months.

01:20:01.212 --> 01:20:03.580
How do I know
you're not lying now?

01:20:03.614 --> 01:20:06.217
Because I'm...
I'm just not.

01:20:06.249 --> 01:20:07.651
I'm not!

01:20:09.419 --> 01:20:12.389
I don't trust you anymore.

01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:48.326
This is it.

01:20:54.365 --> 01:20:55.867
What do you want me
to do?

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.944
Do you mind
if I eat something?

01:21:06.977 --> 01:21:08.246
No.

01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:13.717
Oh, I brought one
for you.

01:21:14.584 --> 01:21:17.355
- I don't eat pastry, thank you.
- Pastry?

01:21:18.222 --> 01:21:20.358
This is <i>maruya.</i>

01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:22.493
My new wife
makes them.

01:21:22.526 --> 01:21:26.630
Saba bananas dipped in pancake
batter, deep fried,

01:21:26.664 --> 01:21:29.333
then lightly sprinkled
with sugar.

01:21:29.365 --> 01:21:31.668
A traditional
Filipino treat.

01:21:32.703 --> 01:21:35.705
Try one.
There's no calories.

01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:38.276
How can it have no calories?

01:21:38.308 --> 01:21:40.878
That's what she says.
Why would she lie?

01:21:42.913 --> 01:21:44.382
I'll take a bite.

01:21:52.121 --> 01:21:54.458
Mmm. Very good.

01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:55.959
- Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:09.307
My crepe myrtle
is just beginning to bloom.

01:22:14.777 --> 01:22:18.749
My husband and I planted
that cypress tree together.

01:22:19.583 --> 01:22:21.319
Oh, God, was it...?

01:22:21.352 --> 01:22:22.954
40 years ago.

01:22:28.359 --> 01:22:30.695
My baby was born
in this house.

01:22:31.594 --> 01:22:34.699
We never
made it to the hospital.

01:22:34.731 --> 01:22:36.933
She just jumped out.

01:22:41.204 --> 01:22:43.407
When I left
my country...

01:22:44.575 --> 01:22:46.878
my mother cried.

01:22:48.879 --> 01:22:51.783
She feared I would
never be home again.

01:22:53.217 --> 01:22:54.919
I told her
not to cry.

01:22:56.186 --> 01:22:58.556
I told her
she is in my heart...

01:23:01.124 --> 01:23:02.993
and that
will always be home.

01:23:43.366 --> 01:23:46.704
Oh! I've got one.

01:23:47.337 --> 01:23:49.839
- Whoo!
- Oh, you are on fire.

01:23:49.873 --> 01:23:53.143
Well, it's because I went
to the physical therapist today.

01:23:53.177 --> 01:23:56.347
I didn't know you needed
physical therapy.

01:23:56.379 --> 01:23:57.882
I don't.

01:24:02.986 --> 01:24:05.089
- Mmm.
- Helen.

01:24:06.022 --> 01:24:08.324
You still haven't talked
to Dan?

01:24:08.357 --> 01:24:11.027
- Nope.
- If she did, she would know.

01:24:12.129 --> 01:24:13.164
Know what?

01:24:14.764 --> 01:24:20.404
Dan resigned, and, uh, they
made him move out this morning.

01:24:20.437 --> 01:24:25.176
Margot and I are thinking about taking
his two-bedroom and help each other out.

01:24:28.411 --> 01:24:31.382
I told you not to tell her.
Jeez.

01:24:31.414 --> 01:24:33.150
Helen! Stop!

01:24:33.984 --> 01:24:35.520
Not now, Janet.

01:24:35.986 --> 01:24:37.688
Helen, wait.

01:24:38.821 --> 01:24:41.225
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to Ken's office.

01:24:41.258 --> 01:24:44.462
- I'm going with you.
- What are you doing?

01:24:46.696 --> 01:24:48.498
I need to help you.

01:24:49.266 --> 01:24:51.902
Now you wanna help me?
Why?

01:24:51.935 --> 01:24:56.339
Because I feel so badly
for the pain I caused you.

01:24:57.406 --> 01:25:01.178
I don't wanna be like this.
I don't wanna be angry forever.

01:25:02.279 --> 01:25:03.848
I wanna be your friend.

01:25:04.815 --> 01:25:08.619
So you're just gonna change
overnight, like that?

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.022
I'm gonna try.

01:25:15.592 --> 01:25:17.161
Okay, we'll see.

01:25:19.029 --> 01:25:20.063
Let's go.

01:25:25.334 --> 01:25:26.436
What?

01:25:27.404 --> 01:25:29.940
I can't believe he
didn't say goodbye to me.

01:25:29.972 --> 01:25:33.977
Oh, he tried to talk to you
a bazillion times last week.

01:25:34.011 --> 01:25:36.080
- You would not talk to him.
- I wasn't ready!

01:25:36.112 --> 01:25:38.182
Now that he's gone,
you're ready?

01:25:38.214 --> 01:25:41.718
- You're not getting angry with me, are you?
- Me?

01:25:42.451 --> 01:25:43.687
No.

01:25:45.621 --> 01:25:47.725
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:25:47.758 --> 01:25:50.427
Why did you kick Dan out?

01:25:50.459 --> 01:25:52.096
He wasn't
Pine Grove material.

01:25:52.129 --> 01:25:53.597
Baloney!

01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:56.900
Truth is you're just angry
your little plot didn't work.

01:25:57.668 --> 01:26:00.004
The truth is that
you should have seen

01:26:00.036 --> 01:26:03.673
how happy he was
to return all his salary.

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:06.476
He returned his salary?

01:26:06.509 --> 01:26:08.611
All of it.
Volunteered.

01:26:08.645 --> 01:26:10.246
Well, where did he go, Ken?

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.683
Well, that information
is confidential, Janet.

01:26:13.816 --> 01:26:15.485
Yeah, in about five seconds

01:26:15.518 --> 01:26:18.621
I'm going to reach across this
desk and rip your throat out.

01:26:18.655 --> 01:26:21.125
Where'd he go, Ken?

01:26:21.157 --> 01:26:23.627
- What're you gonna do?
- I should go see him.

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.430
- Okay.
- A-And I need to talk to him.

01:26:26.463 --> 01:26:27.831
What are you
gonna say?

01:26:27.864 --> 01:26:29.667
Well, I'm going to tell him
that I love him

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.102
and that I pray he still feels
the same about me.

01:26:32.134 --> 01:26:33.837
And then?

01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:36.674
Then I'm gonna kiss his face and ask
him if he still wants to marry me.

01:26:36.706 --> 01:26:38.842
I love that.
Ooh! Oh!

01:26:38.874 --> 01:26:41.311
This is it.
This is his address.

01:26:44.047 --> 01:26:48.352
So are you going to kiss him
before or after you have the talk?

01:26:48.384 --> 01:26:50.987
Probably after.
Maybe before.

01:26:51.021 --> 01:26:54.657
My new wife kisses first...
with a great deal of passion.

01:26:54.691 --> 01:26:55.993
Stop talking!

01:26:56.793 --> 01:26:59.597
- What do you think?
- Kiss first.

01:26:59.629 --> 01:27:01.632
With a great deal
of passion.

01:27:13.477 --> 01:27:16.046
Hi. Can I help you?

01:27:16.079 --> 01:27:17.414
Is Dan here?

01:27:17.446 --> 01:27:19.115
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
he's not here right now.

01:27:19.148 --> 01:27:22.218
Oh, can you tell me
where he is?

01:27:22.252 --> 01:27:24.955
Uh, can you tell me
what this is about?

01:27:26.455 --> 01:27:27.958
Who are you?

01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:30.761
What?
Well, who are you?

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.864
Are you with Dan now?

01:27:33.896 --> 01:27:35.531
I think
you should leave.

01:27:35.565 --> 01:27:37.334
- Dan?
- Okay, goodbye.

01:27:37.366 --> 01:27:39.369
Bye.

01:27:49.545 --> 01:27:51.115
Take me home.

01:28:00.257 --> 01:28:01.292
Helen.

01:28:02.359 --> 01:28:05.029
Helen, I need you
in the flower shop right now.

01:28:05.062 --> 01:28:06.630
We got a lot of arrangements
to get out.

01:28:06.663 --> 01:28:08.398
- Not now, Ken.
- A lot of arrangements.

01:28:08.432 --> 01:28:09.667
- Ken.
- No, no, I'm fine.

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.368
Audrey didn't show up.
Helen, please.

01:28:11.401 --> 01:28:13.838
Please, please, please, please.
Thank you!

01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:18.042
What's all this?

01:28:23.713 --> 01:28:25.850
Who's that woman
in your house?

01:28:26.615 --> 01:28:28.752
You, uh,
you went to my house?

01:28:28.785 --> 01:28:30.254
Who is she?

01:28:30.286 --> 01:28:31.722
She's my sister.

01:28:42.432 --> 01:28:43.701
I'm sorry.

01:28:44.868 --> 01:28:46.404
No, I'm sorry.

01:28:47.437 --> 01:28:48.739
I'm so sorry.

01:28:48.771 --> 01:28:52.176
I-I should have told you
about that garbage.

01:28:52.209 --> 01:28:54.311
I just didn't know how,
you know?

01:28:54.343 --> 01:28:55.779
Yeah, well.

01:28:55.812 --> 01:28:59.616
I was so scared
that I'd lost you.

01:28:59.648 --> 01:29:01.317
Me too.

01:29:03.587 --> 01:29:05.022
I love you.

01:29:05.821 --> 01:29:07.257
I love you too.

01:29:07.289 --> 01:29:09.426
Will you marry me?

01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:13.064
- Yes, yes!
- Yes, yes.

01:29:18.634 --> 01:29:19.669
Do not move.

01:29:19.703 --> 01:29:21.370
No laughing.

01:29:21.404 --> 01:29:23.072
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna show ya.

01:29:23.106 --> 01:29:25.008
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.212
No, no. Don't, no, don't.
Don't, don't. No, really, don't.

01:29:28.245 --> 01:29:30.714
Please marry me.

01:29:30.746 --> 01:29:31.882
He did it!

01:29:31.914 --> 01:29:33.883
I already said yes,
though.

01:29:33.917 --> 01:29:35.518
Yeah, but now
you gotta help me up.

01:29:35.552 --> 01:29:36.954
Okay!

01:29:36.986 --> 01:29:39.956
Married?
This... This Friday?

01:29:41.725 --> 01:29:43.494
What are you trying to do?

01:29:43.526 --> 01:29:45.161
I love him, Laura.

01:29:45.195 --> 01:29:49.266
But it's so fast.
I-I-I don't understand.

01:29:50.499 --> 01:29:51.968
About, I don't know,

01:29:52.002 --> 01:29:54.804
two weeks
before your father died,

01:29:54.838 --> 01:29:57.208
one evening he said to me...

01:29:58.275 --> 01:30:01.911
"Well, honey, doesn't look like
I'm gonna make it.

01:30:02.978 --> 01:30:06.116
But you've got a lot of life
left in you.

01:30:07.851 --> 01:30:09.453
I want you to live it...

01:30:10.419 --> 01:30:12.255
every minute of it.

01:30:13.289 --> 01:30:14.357
Be happy."

01:30:15.558 --> 01:30:16.793
But then when...

01:30:17.861 --> 01:30:19.329
when he passed,
I don't know,

01:30:19.361 --> 01:30:21.164
it was like I went into a
depression or something.

01:30:21.197 --> 01:30:23.933
I just lost interest
in everything

01:30:23.967 --> 01:30:25.335
except the past.

01:30:26.136 --> 01:30:29.106
I-I wasn't even reading,
you know?

01:30:29.138 --> 01:30:32.909
But instead of sharing my grief
with other people,

01:30:32.942 --> 01:30:35.145
I pushed everybody away.

01:30:35.178 --> 01:30:37.748
Even you.
And you were grieving too.

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:39.984
I'm so sorry I did that.

01:30:41.918 --> 01:30:45.856
I mean, I lost a husband,
but you lost a father.

01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:49.527
And then we almost
lost each other.

01:30:50.326 --> 01:30:52.963
I want to be
a family again.

01:30:54.998 --> 01:30:56.801
I want that too, Mom.

01:30:59.236 --> 01:31:03.373
After all,
when Peter goes away to university,

01:31:03.405 --> 01:31:07.777
who's gonna come and have
tea with me on Thursdays

01:31:07.811 --> 01:31:09.280
in our new apartment?

01:31:09.846 --> 01:31:12.415
What?

01:31:12.449 --> 01:31:15.686
Dan and I have decided
to live in Pine Grove.

01:31:17.654 --> 01:31:21.325
- Really?
- Yeah, I-I wanna sell the house.

01:31:21.357 --> 01:31:23.326
Oh, Mom.

01:31:23.927 --> 01:31:25.762
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:31:25.794 --> 01:31:30.066
I-I went to the house recently
and tried to make up my mind

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:31.602
what I was going to do,
you know.

01:31:32.268 --> 01:31:34.070
And I was standing there...

01:31:35.538 --> 01:31:39.409
and all of a sudden I heard
your father's voice inside of me

01:31:39.441 --> 01:31:40.877
and he said...

01:31:43.379 --> 01:31:46.049
"Time to let go,
sweetheart."

01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:49.151
I miss him.

01:31:49.185 --> 01:31:54.057
Um, and I really
missed you, Mom.

01:31:54.891 --> 01:31:56.627
I...

01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.161
I love you.

01:31:58.194 --> 01:32:00.630
I love you too.

01:32:00.664 --> 01:32:04.001
And I would be so honored

01:32:04.034 --> 01:32:08.071
if my beautiful daughter
would be my maid of honor.

01:32:10.874 --> 01:32:12.243
Really?

01:32:12.875 --> 01:32:15.311
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:32:16.646 --> 01:32:18.883
Friday.

01:32:25.554 --> 01:32:27.458
You look nice!

01:33:07.597 --> 01:33:10.500
I know. Beautiful.
It's just beautiful.

01:33:34.456 --> 01:33:37.326
Welcome, everybody,
to the wedding of Helen and Dan.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:41.697
We're blessed today
to celebrate an encore wedding.

01:33:41.731 --> 01:33:43.433
"Encore" means "again."

01:33:43.465 --> 01:33:46.303
And despite
the loss of loved ones

01:33:46.335 --> 01:33:50.306
and all the pain
that life has thrown at them,

01:33:50.339 --> 01:33:54.944
these two stand before us,
having found love again.

01:33:54.977 --> 01:34:00.316
And in doing so,
remind us all that it's never too late.

01:34:01.217 --> 01:34:04.521
It's never too late to...
find friends...

01:34:06.289 --> 01:34:08.592
to tell the truth...

01:34:08.624 --> 01:34:09.993
to laugh a little...

01:34:10.727 --> 01:34:11.729
to find home...

01:34:12.762 --> 01:34:14.965
to take risks...

01:34:14.998 --> 01:34:18.067
and to say to each other,
"I love you."

01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:22.905
Today we celebrate
the power of love.

01:34:22.938 --> 01:34:25.642
It can happen
anywhere, anytime.

01:34:25.674 --> 01:34:29.445
It has no expiration date,
no sell-by date.

01:34:29.478 --> 01:34:32.481
None of that crap.

01:34:32.514 --> 01:34:36.052
And let's face it...
80's the new 18.

01:34:38.454 --> 01:34:41.824
So what do you say?
You wanna get married?

01:34:49.999 --> 01:34:53.103
So, are you ready
for college?

01:34:53.136 --> 01:34:54.370
I am now!

01:35:08.485 --> 01:35:09.585
Ah!

01:35:11.654 --> 01:35:12.856
Come on.

01:35:15.792 --> 01:35:17.928
Oh, uh...
Mrs. Simpson.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.763
Mrs. Simpson.
Is that me?

01:35:20.797 --> 01:35:22.531
Uh, I sure hope so.

01:35:23.999 --> 01:35:25.768
You feeling all right,
honey?

01:35:25.802 --> 01:35:27.804
I love being Mrs. Simpson.

01:35:32.475 --> 01:35:35.779
I just want to, uh,
grow old with you.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.148
You are old with me.
