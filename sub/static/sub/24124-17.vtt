WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.458 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.500
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.500 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.208
to count on a friend

00:38.208 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:13.708 --> 01:16.875
And who's this,
Christopher Robin?

01:16.875 --> 01:19.708
That's a bear, Pooh.
You're related to him.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.416
Oh.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.000
I rather thought
I was related to bees,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.250
since we both like honey so.

01:30.375 --> 01:34.958
Hoo. There's my noble
cousin the eagle.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.375
What about me,
Christopher Robin?

01:37.375 --> 01:38.583
Wait a minute.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.583
There's got to be
a tigger relative

01:40.583 --> 01:42.708
in there somewheres.

01:42.708 --> 01:45.875
Like, um, there,
for example.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.375
Hello, cousin.

01:49.375 --> 01:52.291
Hate to be the one
to tell you, Tigger,

01:52.291 --> 01:55.000
but you're not
related to zebras.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.125
Why, we're first cousins.

01:57.125 --> 01:58.875
Just look at these stripes.

01:58.875 --> 02:02.583
Don't see how you can be
with a tail like that.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.708
Far too long.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.583
Definitely
not a zebra's tail.

02:08.833 --> 02:11.875
I'm not related
to-- to nobody.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.583
Christopher Robin:
Well, Tigger,

02:13.583 --> 02:16.833
well, you're sort of
related to a-- to--

02:16.833 --> 02:19.166
-  To him?

02:19.166 --> 02:21.000
I'm related to this lion,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.166
isn't I,
Christopher Robin?

02:23.166 --> 02:25.583
Well, I guess
you are, sort of.

02:25.583 --> 02:28.083
And the lion's
king of the beasts.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.458
King of the beasties?

02:29.458 --> 02:31.125
I got royal blood.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.833
I'm a king!

02:32.833 --> 02:34.958
- By the way,

02:34.958 --> 02:37.166
what exactically
does a king do?

02:37.166 --> 02:40.875
Does he get all the free
icy cream he can eat? Hmm?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.708
If I'm King of
the Hundred Acre Wood,

02:42.708 --> 02:44.125
doesn't that mean--

02:44.125 --> 02:45.875
But we're not beasties,
Tigger,

02:45.875 --> 02:47.708
so we don't need a king.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.458
Of course
you need a king.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.333
Why, why...

02:51.333 --> 02:53.833
what if a wild jagular
was on the loose?

02:53.833 --> 02:55.125
Why, they're the most biggest,

02:55.125 --> 02:56.458
most horriblest,

02:56.458 --> 02:58.625
most gruesomest
creatures there is.

02:58.625 --> 03:01.125
And they got teeth this long.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.625
Oh, d-d-dear.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.166
What would we do?

03:04.166 --> 03:06.750
Why, you'd just call
your king to protect you.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.458
If you had one.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.458
Okay, Tigger,

03:11.458 --> 03:13.625
if there's ever
a jagular on the loose,

03:13.625 --> 03:15.458
you can be king.

03:15.458 --> 03:19.458
Hmm. Where's a jagular
when you need one?

03:19.458 --> 03:22.208
Good thing old bunny boy
is not around.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.625
Hmm. Now let me see.

03:26.625 --> 03:28.083
I can use one of these,

03:28.083 --> 03:29.250
oh, and one of those,

03:29.250 --> 03:30.750
and, uh-- Ah.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.583
Perfect jagular material.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.458
Pooh, couldn't we have
flutterbies indoors

03:38.458 --> 03:41.708
in case there are
any-- jagulars around?

03:41.708 --> 03:44.166
Jagulars? Around here?

03:44.166 --> 03:46.333
Ah, that's
a lot of hooey.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.000
Head for the hills!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.708
Head for the hills!

03:49.708 --> 03:52.875
But, Tigger, this is a hill.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.625
Jagular! Jagular!

03:54.625 --> 03:56.208
Run for your lives!

03:56.208 --> 03:58.875
J-J-Jagular? W-W-Where?

03:58.875 --> 04:00.875
- There!
-

04:00.875 --> 04:02.625
All: Yaah!

04:02.625 --> 04:04.083
Back, you beast!

04:04.083 --> 04:06.625
No jagular's going
to get my friends,

04:06.625 --> 04:09.291
just because they don't have
a king to protect them.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.625
- Hooray for Tigger!

04:16.625 --> 04:18.708
He's our hero
of the day.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.500
It was nothing, realish.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.250
I don't kind doing
kingly stuff for you,

04:25.250 --> 04:27.708
since you don't
have a king to do it.

04:27.708 --> 04:31.416
Oh, w-what if there are
m-m-more jagulars?

04:31.416 --> 04:33.125
You're
not going to be safe

04:33.125 --> 04:35.125
without a king
to protect you.

04:35.125 --> 04:38.750
I wonder where the nearest
king might be.

04:44.875 --> 04:47.375
Pooh: Because
you were so brave

04:47.375 --> 04:49.708
and saved us
from the jagular,

04:49.708 --> 04:54.500
we crown you Tigger,
King of the Beasties.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.458
As your king of the beasties,

04:58.458 --> 05:01.333
I've got a few proclamations
to proclamate,

05:01.333 --> 05:03.750
on account of that's
what kings do best.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.333
What in the world?

05:13.125 --> 05:14.458
Number first:

05:14.458 --> 05:17.083
from now on
and forever after,

05:17.083 --> 05:18.291
the Hundred Acre Wood

05:18.291 --> 05:21.000
is gonna be called Tiggeropolis.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.875
Tiggeropolis?

05:22.875 --> 05:25.875
Ha! Why do you want to go
and change the name?

05:25.875 --> 05:27.458
How will we
get our mail?

05:28.458 --> 05:32.083
Yaah! Another j-j-jagular!

05:32.083 --> 05:35.416
My tablecloth? And my--

05:35.416 --> 05:37.416
Don't worry.
I'll save you.

05:44.416 --> 05:45.833
You were saying?

05:48.333 --> 05:49.458
Didn't say a word.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.125
What is going on here?

05:52.125 --> 05:54.708
If Tigger wants
to borrow something,

05:54.708 --> 05:56.875
he should at least ask first.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.833
I'll teach him a lesson.

06:01.583 --> 06:03.875
For my next proclamation,

06:03.875 --> 06:06.458
I'm getting kind of tired
of the colors around here,

06:06.458 --> 06:09.125
so we're going to do
some, uh, painting.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.291
We're going
to stripe the forest

06:11.291 --> 06:12.958
in royal orange and black.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.000
But if we stripe the forest,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.958
might it not confuse
the honeybees?

06:18.958 --> 06:21.083
Hark. Was that a jagular?

06:27.833 --> 06:30.583
There's nothing
quite like royalty

06:30.583 --> 06:33.375
to make a place respectable.

06:33.375 --> 06:36.000
your majesty

06:36.000 --> 06:38.833
we'll all be more, uh...

06:38.833 --> 06:41.375
majestical.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.500
just think of me

06:45.458 --> 06:48.083
all bow down, it's okay

06:48.083 --> 06:49.583
I deserve it.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.333
with black, oh, my

06:53.250 --> 06:57.166
I'm not around

07:03.625 --> 07:06.875
you ever did

07:13.125 --> 07:15.416
Now that's more like it.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.416
Seeing as this
is Tiggeropolis,

07:19.416 --> 07:21.291
named for a very
famous tigger--

07:21.291 --> 07:22.416
namely me--

07:22.416 --> 07:24.500
I want everybody to bounce,

07:24.500 --> 07:25.583
like their king.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.583
Ohh, King Tigger,

07:27.583 --> 07:29.250
after all the painting,

07:29.250 --> 07:31.458
my feet seem to be
telling me something.

07:31.458 --> 07:35.833
"A nap would be nice, Pooh,"
they seem to be saying.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.083
Don't be scared,
loyal subjects.

07:41.083 --> 07:43.458
Ha ha. I won't
let him get at you.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.625
Him who?

07:44.625 --> 07:47.625
Him him. The jagu-- lar.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.625
Hmm. Must have run
away from home

07:50.625 --> 07:54.000
and left a note. Hoo!
Awful bad handwriting.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
If you'll allow me,
King Tigger.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.458
Ahem.

07:57.458 --> 08:01.416
"I untied my friend
and took him with me.

08:01.416 --> 08:04.583
Signed, another jagular."

08:04.583 --> 08:06.750
Another jagular?

08:08.458 --> 08:10.625
And this one's
probably real.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.625
Uh, since there's a wild
jagular on the loose,

08:14.625 --> 08:17.250
your king says, uh...

08:17.250 --> 08:18.583
head for the hills!

08:18.583 --> 08:21.750
But, King Tigger,
might it not be better

08:21.750 --> 08:24.000
if we captured him?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.583
Uh, yeah, well, capture.

08:27.583 --> 08:31.583
Uh, your king doesn't think
that's such a good idea.

08:31.583 --> 08:34.625
B-B-But, King Tigger,
you have to protect us.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.458
But-- But-- B--

08:38.125 --> 08:39.333
I guess you're right.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.166
It's my duty as, um--

08:41.166 --> 08:44.708
--
K-King of the Beasties.

08:44.708 --> 08:47.000
Mm. Must be headed that way.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
But, King Tigger,
the tracks go that way.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.500
Aw, ha, that's an old jagular
trick, Pooh boy. Ha ha!

08:54.500 --> 08:58.083
You got to be a king to know
these things, you know.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.416
Hoo hoo hoo!
What do you know?

09:00.416 --> 09:03.000
We ended up at Rabbit's.
Ha ha ha!

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Maybe we ought to go in
and rest for a while.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.750
After we nail the door shut.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.708
The j-j-jagular!

09:11.708 --> 09:14.416
Well,
looks like he's sleeping.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.708
Maybe we'd better
leave him alone.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.625
Jagulars are kind of grouchy

09:18.625 --> 09:20.333
when you wake them
up, you know.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.250
King Tigger,
you have to capture him,

09:22.250 --> 09:24.416
or we'll never be safe.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.625
You're right, Piglet.
I'm going to go in there

09:29.625 --> 09:31.708
and take care of that jagular

09:36.250 --> 09:38.875
- Tigger!
- Can't talk now, Rabbit.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.708
I'm busy saving you guys
from this jagular.

09:41.708 --> 09:44.833
What jagular?
That's my tablecloth.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.583
Heh heh.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.708
It is?

09:48.708 --> 09:51.625
Mm. Pretty clever
of a tablecloth,

09:51.625 --> 09:53.875
disguising itself
as a jagular.

09:53.875 --> 09:57.375
You mean your tablecloth
isn't a jagular?

09:57.375 --> 10:00.750
Of course not,
loyal subject. Heh heh.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.875
But there's still that
other jagular out there--

10:03.875 --> 10:05.583
the one with
the bad handwriting.

10:05.583 --> 10:09.291
The bad handwriting
was mine, Tigger.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.458
I wrote it
to teach you a lesson

10:11.458 --> 10:14.291
about borrowing my things
without asking.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.416
I don't understand,
King Tigger.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.416
I gots a confession to make.

10:19.416 --> 10:22.416
I made up the jagular
on account of because

10:22.416 --> 10:24.833
I wanted to be king so bad.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.250
I k-- I kind of got
carried away.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.833
I'm s-s-sorry.

10:30.833 --> 10:33.166
I suppose
we could forgive him.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.000
After all,
he is our friend.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.583
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.583
That's it. Forgive him.
Forgive him.

10:39.583 --> 10:43.875
What about all that painting
and bouncing stuff? Hmm?

10:43.875 --> 10:46.000
What, that? Hoo!

10:46.000 --> 10:49.250
I double-dipple promise
not to do that stuff again.

10:49.250 --> 10:52.833
Come on. Come on. Let's
have us a king uncrowning.

10:56.458 --> 10:59.333
I feel like a new tigger.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.291
It was kind of
weighing me down

11:01.291 --> 11:03.250
being responsible
for all you guys.

11:03.250 --> 11:08.000
Anyways, who wants to be
related to a lion?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.875
I bet I'm first cousins
to something better,

11:10.875 --> 11:14.625
like, uh, one of them
boa restrictors.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.416
Yeah. Or maybe a...

11:17.625 --> 11:19.000
a hammernose shark.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.458
Or I could be, uh, maybe--

11:20.458 --> 11:23.583
Mm, Tigger, after all,

11:23.583 --> 11:25.375
you are the only one.

11:26.875 --> 11:29.333
Nah. Ha! I bet I come

11:29.333 --> 11:31.583
from a long line
of hippopotamooses

11:31.583 --> 11:33.333
or maybe some octopooses.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.458
Yeah. Or an elevator. Ha!

11:35.458 --> 11:38.000
Hey, we can't rule out
the insects, you know.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.416
Come on, come on.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.875
Yes? Yes?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.250
A walnut?

12:37.291 --> 12:38.333
Open it.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.416
Oh, boy.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.583
Yipe!

13:26.291 --> 13:29.750
I hope that's not more water
wanting to come inside.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.583
Hello. Oh!

13:35.958 --> 13:38.458
The packrats!

13:38.458 --> 13:40.333
Ah-choo!

13:40.333 --> 13:42.166
Burglars! Thieves!

13:42.166 --> 13:44.125
Help!

13:46.250 --> 13:50.958
Excuse me, but I believe
this is my house.

13:50.958 --> 13:53.291
Perhaps you should leave.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.250
Ah-choo!

14:00.250 --> 14:02.750
Than again, perhaps not.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.291
I suppose you can stay

14:06.291 --> 14:08.333
until it stops raining.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It would be hard to find
anyone else to take you in

14:16.000 --> 14:18.458
with your reputation for, uh,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.625
if you'll excuse
the expression,

14:20.625 --> 14:22.291
uh, stealing.

14:23.750 --> 14:24.958
Us?

14:24.958 --> 14:27.000
Oh, no, no.
Never, never.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.208
We pay. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. We pay.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.875
Oh. That's, uh...

14:34.875 --> 14:36.583
very nice,

14:36.583 --> 14:41.708
but when favorite things
end up missing,

14:41.708 --> 14:44.875
not everyone is happy
with walnuts in return.

14:44.875 --> 14:48.625
Besides, walnuts aren't
going to stop my leaks.

14:48.625 --> 14:51.000
What I need are more
pots and pans.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.708
Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.208
We pay, we pay.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.708
Was it something I said?

15:04.833 --> 15:07.000
Oh, my goodness.

15:11.708 --> 15:12.708
Hey, come on.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.083
If only these leaks

15:14.083 --> 15:15.875
would make up their minds.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.333
Oh, d-d-dear.

15:23.708 --> 15:26.875
Out! Out! Out, out, out!

15:26.875 --> 15:30.458
Oh, pretty soon there'll
be more water in here

15:30.458 --> 15:31.875
than outside.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.583
Ha! Think you got it bad?

15:40.583 --> 15:42.875
My tunnels are soaked.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.250
This weather isn't fit
for man nor beast.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.958
Not to mention gophers.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.000
Oh. All right, Gopher.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.416
If you want to stay,
grab a pot and start bailing.

15:55.416 --> 15:59.750
Hmm. Seems like somebody's
already grabbed them, Rabbit.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.375
And it's not too hard
to figure out who.

16:03.375 --> 16:06.125
The packrats!

16:09.458 --> 16:16.000
My. What an interesting
and very large present.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.708
For me?

16:19.708 --> 16:21.291
- Oh, bother.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.750
Who can that be?

16:22.750 --> 16:23.958
Uh-oh.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.958
Thank goodness
you're safe, buddy bear.

16:28.958 --> 16:32.958
Yeah. Those sticky-fingered
packrats are at it again.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.000
Better stay on the look-see.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.708
For me? Heh heh. Aw,
you shouldn't have did it.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.000
Um, why that's, uh...

16:42.000 --> 16:44.583
that's a present from, uh,

16:44.583 --> 16:46.875
from my cousins. Yes.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.291
It's from my cousins,

16:48.291 --> 16:50.166
those these aren't them.

16:50.166 --> 16:53.375
Oh, yeah. Ha ha! I can see
the family resemblement.

16:55.208 --> 16:59.458
But never mind that.
Let's open my present.

17:02.625 --> 17:06.208
Oh, I say. It's our
missing kitchenware.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.208
Oh, Pooh,
how could you?

17:10.333 --> 17:13.875
Now, it is very nice
to get things,

17:13.875 --> 17:18.500
but it's even nicer
to give than to, uh, take.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.000
It's much more polite.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.333
It keeps everyone so happy.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.875
- Happy, happy.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.416
I'm so glad you agree.

17:28.416 --> 17:31.416
Good night. Sleep tight.

17:32.416 --> 17:33.750
Oh, give, give, give.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.416
Happy, happy, happy.
Come on.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.500
Uh, happy, happy.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.708
Oh, no.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.875
I must be sleeping
in my sleep again.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.166
I think.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.000
Yikes!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.416
Yaah!

18:01.416 --> 18:04.875
What are all of Pooh's
things doing here?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.833
I'm going to have to see
Pooh about this.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.875
If he wants
to move in with me,

18:08.875 --> 18:11.250
he's going to have
to ask first.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.708
But why did you
take my things

18:15.708 --> 18:17.583
and without asking?

18:17.583 --> 18:20.500
When someone does
something nice for you,

18:20.500 --> 18:23.708
you're supposed to do
something nice for them.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.875
That's called friendship.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.500
And I thought
you were my friends.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.250
- Nice, nice.
- Friends, friends.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.708
Good work, sonny.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.750
You captured the rascals
right in the act.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.708
You've done the right thing,
Pooh bear.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.750
Now let us handle it.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.458
Don't worry, Pooh.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.875
They took
all of your things,

18:48.875 --> 18:50.458
but they gave them to me

18:50.458 --> 18:53.208
They must have known
we were best friends.

18:53.208 --> 18:56.083
Ha! You got them
on the run, bunny boy.

18:56.083 --> 18:59.416
Now trap those rats
like, uh, uh, like rats.

18:59.416 --> 19:01.458
- Um, excuse me,

19:01.458 --> 19:04.416
but so thieves usually
give things away

19:04.416 --> 19:06.083
to piglets, Tigger?

19:06.083 --> 19:09.125
They was probably just
being extra double sneaky,

19:09.125 --> 19:11.458
taking and giving
and giving and taking.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.750
Take? Give?

19:13.750 --> 19:16.166
Take, give.

19:16.166 --> 19:17.166
Wait!

19:18.333 --> 19:20.291
They're not thieves.

19:20.291 --> 19:22.458
They're just
a little confused.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.500
It was something I said,
I think.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
Give, give. Nice, nice.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.458
Pooh's very softhearted.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.250
Soft-headed
if you ask me.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.083
Well, it won't work this time.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.708
First your house, Pooh,

19:35.708 --> 19:38.625
then the rest of
the Hundred Acre Wood.

19:38.625 --> 19:42.833
I'm going to put a stop
to this right now!

19:44.000 --> 19:46.833
- But, Rabbit--
- No buts, Pooh.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.458
- Nice, nice.
- Nice, nice.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.458
Yeah. Nice, nice.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.291
Nice, uh-huh.

19:58.708 --> 20:02.000
After them.
They'll rob our homes next.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.625
Quick. Follow me.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.333
Ya-ha-ha-ha-ha!

20:05.333 --> 20:08.625
Do we have to, Rabbit?

20:17.625 --> 20:19.958
Rabbit's house
is just like the others.

20:19.958 --> 20:23.625
Nothing there, stripped bare,
clean as a...whistle.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.458
Nothing but these walnuts.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.708
Maybe they really are thieves.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.500
Owl:
Hoo! This is nothing.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.875
Why, back in aught-6,
the water rose so high,

20:35.875 --> 20:38.250
it flooded the rain clouds.

20:38.250 --> 20:42.166
There, there. If the pack rats
hadn't taken your things,

20:42.166 --> 20:44.250
the flood would have
ruined them.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.750
That's not the point.
They stole our things.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.875
Gone! Everything I had.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.750
Nothing left.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.416
But you never had
anything, Tigger.

20:59.416 --> 21:02.000
Hey! You're right,
kiddo. Ha!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.458
Saved by circumchances.

21:06.250 --> 21:09.125
Grab them! They're after
Owl's things, too!

21:09.125 --> 21:10.750
No, no, no. Lookie-lookie.

21:10.750 --> 21:15.250
Hmm. Why do they want us
to look in the closet?

21:15.250 --> 21:18.208
Because it's a trick
of some sort. I'll prove it.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.416
Aah!

21:27.750 --> 21:32.250
Well! What do you know?
My ball pin hammer.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.458
Oh, they didn't
steal our things.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.125
They saved them
from the flood.

21:36.125 --> 21:37.250
Ta-da!

21:37.250 --> 21:39.583
Then they're not thieves?

21:39.583 --> 21:41.583
They're heroes?

21:42.875 --> 21:44.416
And so we are here

21:44.416 --> 21:46.083
to congratulate the pack rats

21:46.083 --> 21:49.333
for learning that
what others have coming

21:49.333 --> 21:51.083
is something that
should be going--

21:51.083 --> 21:53.458
--
in the first place.

21:53.458 --> 21:56.583
And this cake is
to show our gratitude.

22:00.125 --> 22:03.291
- Ah, ta-da!
-

22:05.833 --> 22:08.333
Thank you very much.

22:09.708 --> 22:13.625
I suppose no one can
have too many walnuts.
