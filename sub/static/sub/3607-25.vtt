00:02.001 --> 00:03.127
Previously on Lost:

00:03.212 --> 00:07.048
The others are coming.
They're coming for all of you.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.925
You have only three choices.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.010
Run. Hide.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.345
Or die.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.889
All I can tell you now
is we do have a plan.

00:14.973 --> 00:18.768
Yeah. Go in the jungle, and get
dynamite and blow open a hatch,

00:18.852 --> 00:20.687
and then hide everyone inside.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.106
Nitroglycerine is extremely
temperamental.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.524
So we just...

00:29.697 --> 00:32.990
Locke, maybe this isn't the best way.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.827
It's the only way, Jack.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.829
- I'm carrying one.
- Not gonna happen.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.622
- This is not your decision.
- It is.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.207
We'll draw straws.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.544
We don't have time to argue
about who risks their life.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.423
Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.592
May I hold him?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.723
She has a head start.
If we leave now, we can catch her.

00:56.807 --> 01:00.309
- Get him back, Charlie.
- I will get him back.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.235
- Is this where Boone fell?
- The plane was loaded with heroin.

01:15.534 --> 01:20.913
So, dude, what do you think's
inside that hatch thing?

01:20.998 --> 01:22.707
Hope.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.709
I think hope's inside.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.095
Whoever named this place
Dark Territory,

01:36.180 --> 01:37.722
genius.

01:55.199 --> 01:58.034
Yeah. I saw it.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.828
We gotta get out of here.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.732
Locke! What are you doing?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.760
Locke! Locke!

03:42.973 --> 03:43.973
Jack?

03:46.101 --> 03:47.977
Jack!

03:57.654 --> 03:59.322
Locke!

04:16.423 --> 04:19.591
- Oh, my God. Locke!
- I need the dynamite!

04:20.552 --> 04:22.178
No, no. It's in my pack.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.513
Go get it! Hurry! Go!

04:26.183 --> 04:29.393
John. John, just hold on.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.104
- Just let me go.
- What?

04:32.189 --> 04:34.065
- I'll be all right.
- No!

04:34.149 --> 04:36.859
- Let me go! I'll be all right.
- I got it! I got it!

04:37.653 --> 04:39.236
Be careful unwrapping it.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.072
All right.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.115
- Now throw it in.
- No! It'll blow us up.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.534
- Do it! Hurry! I can't hold him.
- Don't do this.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.496
Throw it in. Now, Kate!

05:38.338 --> 05:40.339
Hey.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.343
Your wife... wife made this for you?

05:44.428 --> 05:45.803
Sun.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.596
She sounded it out, huh?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.766
- So you can learn English.
- Yes.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.602
Yeah, I wish she made one for me.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.188
So, what words are in here?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.984
English words.
What can you say?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.031
Starboard.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.701
Aft. Port.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.330
Sail.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.709
- Eat.
- Yeah, right.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.544
She did you well.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.880
I hope you know
how lucky you are, man.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.928
Back in business?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.515
Alrighty.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.436
Oh, hey...

06:36.396 --> 06:38.522
...it's yours.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.327
- Here we are.
- You.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.120
What?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.250
You.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.428
Thank you. Thanks.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.696
I made you some tea.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.033
I'm fine.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.914
Thanks.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.132
Aaron is a beautiful name.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.466
What does it mean?

07:52.597 --> 07:55.182
I don't know what Aaron means.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.940
- They will bring him back.
- Don't say that.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.733
- They will.
- How do you know?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.319
Because he said he would.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.242
Charlie will bring your baby back.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.341
- There!
- Charlie, wait!

08:39.269 --> 08:40.436
See. Let me see.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.313
- It's bleeding.
- We need to put pressure on it.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.107
OK. Put pressure.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.198
- Animal! What is she...?
- Keep the pressure on, like this!

08:52.282 --> 08:56.076
She's been here for 16 years.
She's learned how to set traps quickly.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.412
OK, let's have a look. It's too deep.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.165
It's bleeding too much.
You have to go back.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.625
I'm not. You have to fix it.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.710
- I'm not a doctor.
- You're a soldier!

09:04.794 --> 09:06.921
What do people do
when they get wounded?

09:07.005 --> 09:10.132
I'm not going back
without that baby, Sayid.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.972
Don't move.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.030
- Gunpowder?
- Remove the towel, tilt your head back.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.242
Remove the towel.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.119
This is because I hit you, isn't it?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.965
This is not going to be pleasant.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.133
You ready?

09:56.429 --> 09:59.306
One. Two. Three.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.341
Oh, man.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.218
I need my car.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.804
Twenty minutes?
Look, I can't miss my flight.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.556
My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

10:48.565 --> 10:52.109
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on. Cool.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.118
Some of us have
a bloody flight to make.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.998
Excuse me. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.840
Come on. Come on.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.597
No. No. No!

11:40.700 --> 11:43.869
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out. Coming through.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.121
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out! Excuse me.

11:53.338 --> 12:01.387
Flight 917 is now
boarding at gate 85.

12:01.471 --> 12:04.932
Any way we can hurry that up?
My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

12:05.016 --> 12:09.144
Or... today. I don't know, I don't
really get the whole time change thing,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.813
but I gotta make that flight.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.066
I am going as fast
as the system will allow me, dear.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.443
You are confirmed for seat 20-G.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.406
However, the airline has
a policy that a man of your size

12:20.490 --> 12:21.990
must purchase two tickets.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.203
What? I didn't have to do that
on the flight out here.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.622
Am I going to have to weigh you, dear?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.502
Fine. Whatever.
I'll buy the one next to it.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.841
- Alrighty. Here's two together.
- Book it.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.594
Departure gate for flight 143
has been changed...

12:44.139 --> 12:45.431
"Uh-oh?" What "uh-oh?"

12:45.515 --> 12:48.100
It appears that your flight
is already boarding

12:48.184 --> 12:53.021
in the international terminal.
This is the domestic terminal.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.566
I don't think you're meant
to make this flight.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.165
Sorry. Pardon me.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.042
Excuse me. Sorry.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.879
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.092
Excuse me! Coming through.
Behind you. Look out!

13:27.348 --> 13:30.517
Sorry. Sorry! Sorry,
this is an emergency. I gotta...

13:30.602 --> 13:33.770
I gotta cut through.
Excuse me. Dude. Dude.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.899
- Back of the line.
- Let me go ahead. I'm gonna miss my...

13:36.983 --> 13:40.360
- You don't understand. This is...
- Back of the line.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.740
Next.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.203
Now? You're taking
the computer out now?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.922
Hey! Old guy!

14:01.883 --> 14:04.134
I'll give you 500
to borrow your scooter.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.428
I just had a hip replacement.
I need this.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.432
OK. Sixteen hundred bucks.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.314
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.566
Coming through! Look out.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.985
Look out, look out.
Coming through.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.362
Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.864
Look out. Heads up.
Coming through. Look out.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.075
Coming through. Coming through.

14:36.876 --> 14:41.046
Look out! Look out! Hold it!

14:41.130 --> 14:43.340
Hold the door! Hold the door!

14:46.803 --> 14:49.638
Hold... Hold the door!

14:52.809 --> 14:55.060
I gotta get on... this flight!

14:55.144 --> 14:57.312
- Sir, the Jetway's closed.
- Please.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.232
For the love of all that is
good and holy in the world,

15:00.316 --> 15:02.317
let me on this plane.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.447
All right, one second.

15:08.783 --> 15:12.119
Hunter? This is Gina.
We've got one more.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.999
Ta.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.710
This is your lucky day.

15:36.019 --> 15:39.187
Fifteen, 16, 23, 42, four.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.820
You say something?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.447
Nope.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.286
I thought I heard 23.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.413
Does that mean something to you?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.249
- What?
- That number? 23?

16:01.961 --> 16:05.631
The guy who called the feds
on me back in Australia

16:05.715 --> 16:07.924
did it for a $23,000 reward.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.219
Mean something to you?

16:12.055 --> 16:15.182
Nah. It's just a number.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.394
Better catch up.
I can barely see 'em.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.825
We shouldn't be this close
to each other, Jack.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.912
If we blow up, we blow up.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.957
What the hell was all that
about back there?

16:41.042 --> 16:43.460
- What was what about?
- You asked to let you go.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.503
That's right.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.421
That thing was
taking you down the hole.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.174
- It wasn't gonna hurt me.
- It was gonna kill you.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.176
I seriously doubt that.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.011
Look, I need for you to...

16:53.096 --> 16:56.807
I need for you to explain to me what
the hell's going on inside your head.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.851
I need to know why you believe
that thing wasn't gonna...

16:59.936 --> 17:03.730
- I believe that I was being tested.
- Tested.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.941
Yeah. Tested.

17:07.109 --> 17:10.945
I think that's why you and I
don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.031
- Because you're a man of science.
- Yeah.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.702
- And what does that make you?
- Me?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.954
Well, I'm a man of faith.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.960
Do you really think
all this is an accident?

17:25.752 --> 17:28.003
That we, a group
of strangers, survived.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.383
Many of us with
just superficial injuries.

17:31.467 --> 17:36.304
You think we crashed on this place
by coincidence? Especially this place.

17:36.389 --> 17:40.267
We were brought here for a purpose.
For a reason. All of us.

17:40.351 --> 17:44.354
Each one of us
was brought here for a reason.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.481
Brought here?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.401
And who brought us here, John?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.653
The island.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.740
The island brought us here.

17:54.824 --> 17:58.326
This is no ordinary place.
You've seen that, I know you have.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.539
The island chose you too, Jack.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.333
It's destiny.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.505
Did you talk with Boone
about destiny, John?

18:15.052 --> 18:18.597
Boone was a sacrifice
that the island demanded.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.439
What happened to him at that plane
was a part of a chain of events

18:27.523 --> 18:30.108
that led us here,
that led us down a path,

18:30.193 --> 18:33.945
that led you and me to this day,
to right now.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.742
And where's that path end, John?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.036
The path ends at the hatch.

18:42.705 --> 18:46.374
The hatch, Jack. All of it. All of it
happened so we can open the hatch.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.878
No. No, we're opening the hatch
so that we can survive.

18:51.047 --> 18:53.965
Survival is all relative, Jack.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.350
I don't believe in destiny.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.229
Yes, you do.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.566
You just don't know it yet.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.680
I'm sorry, sir, but the
special wheelchair that we use

19:41.764 --> 19:45.767
for loading disabled passengers, no one
seems to know where it is right now,

19:45.852 --> 19:49.020
and unless we find it,
I'm not sure we can get you on.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.481
There's not another flight
till tomorrow.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.775
I'm aware,
but there's nothing I can do.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.987
Look, I can get Michelle.
We can carry him on.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.572
Mind if we carry you on?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.577
No, that would be fine.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.211
Here we go.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.422
Here's your seat.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.886
I'll get your bags, sir.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.555
If you need anything,
press the "call" button.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.683
OK. Thank you.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.286
Hugo,

21:28.371 --> 21:30.956
take these extra sticks
back a couple hundred yards.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.624
Me?

21:34.627 --> 21:37.921
Oh, OK. Got it.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.132
Be careful.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.304
Can I have a flashlight?

21:46.389 --> 21:50.225
'Cause the torch around the dynamite
thing, not making sense to me.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.897
Kate, you run the fuse.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.528
- Jack and I will rig the charges.
- OK.

22:29.432 --> 22:33.268
- I turned it on a little while ago.
- Sayid said every hour.

22:33.352 --> 22:37.605
Look, we're 15 miles out.
We could be here for weeks.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.234
- If that battery runs out...
- The man said every hour.

22:46.449 --> 22:50.660
- Nothing.
- Five minutes. No more.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.454
Aye, aye.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.583
Know what I like about you, Mike?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.376
You got the patience of a saint.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.503
Yeah? Why you say that?

23:01.547 --> 23:03.506
I've seen the way he talks to you.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.927
The way he runs around,
does whatever the hell he wants.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.889
I'd have shown him
the back of my hand a long time ago.

23:11.932 --> 23:16.144
- You would, huh?
- Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.

23:16.729 --> 23:20.231
Is that what your father did to you?
Show you the back of his hand?

23:20.316 --> 23:23.902
My daddy never got a chance to beat me.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.695
Shot himself when I was eight.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.366
That why you wanna die?

23:32.828 --> 23:33.870
What?

23:33.954 --> 23:37.457
Since you told me you wanted
on this raft, I couldn't figure it out.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.418
Why's a guy who
only cares about himself

23:40.503 --> 23:43.171
wanna risk his life
to save everyone else?

23:45.007 --> 23:47.842
Way I see it,
there's only two choices.

23:48.594 --> 23:53.139
You're either a hero,
or you wanna die.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.769
Well...

23:58.854 --> 24:01.189
I ain't no hero, Mike.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.076
That what I think it is?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.872
Something's out there.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.076
What the hell is that?

24:57.037 --> 24:59.247
There's no footprints, no tracks.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.209
This is it?
This is the black smoke?

25:04.461 --> 25:08.089
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.308
She's here.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.102
Danielle?

25:22.563 --> 25:26.524
- You come out! Right now!
- Calm down.

25:29.945 --> 25:33.948
Danielle, I can hear you. Come out.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.327
Please. He needs his mother.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.589
- They were not here.
- Danielle,

25:50.299 --> 25:52.550
you have to give us the baby.

25:54.637 --> 25:58.264
I just wanted my Alex back.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.979
I thought if I gave them the baby...

26:16.325 --> 26:20.328
It's OK. I know.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.092
It's OK.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.272
I got him.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.861
There never were any others.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.155
You started the fires yourself!

26:56.699 --> 27:00.118
No. I heard them whispering.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.620
You're a nut job.
You heard nothing.

27:03.163 --> 27:06.624
I heard them say
they were coming for the child.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.838
The others said
they were coming for the boy.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.976
You're pathetic.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.366
Wire.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.960
Hold that end.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.518
Now the fuse.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.490
I'll do it.

28:54.608 --> 28:58.111
- That's as far as it goes.
- It's far enough.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.530
I'll light it. You take cover.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.616
There'll be enough
burn time for me to get clear.

29:04.159 --> 29:07.328
- Hurley!
- Wait. Just a sec.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.214
What was that about back there?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.427
What was what about?

29:22.511 --> 29:25.721
Putting the dynamite in your pack.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.058
- I made a judgment call.
- We drew straws.

29:29.143 --> 29:32.395
I'm not gonna let drawing straws
make decisions like that.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.771
You had no right.

29:33.856 --> 29:37.316
Everybody wants me to be a leader
till I make a decision they don't like.

29:37.401 --> 29:40.194
You want to keep second guessing me?
That's your call.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.905
There's something you need to know.

29:44.575 --> 29:47.201
If we survive this,
if we survive tonight...

29:48.996 --> 29:51.038
...we're gonna
have a Locke problem.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.380
And I have to know
that you've got my back.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.050
I got your back.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.638
Are we ready?

30:07.723 --> 30:09.765
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.494
No, no, no.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.414
Stop! Stop, we can't do this.

30:34.416 --> 30:38.127
Stop! Wait!
Stop! We can't do this!

30:38.212 --> 30:41.672
Stop it! Stop it! We can't!

30:41.757 --> 30:44.300
Stop, don't light it!
We can't do this!

30:44.384 --> 30:47.053
We can't do this!
Stop! What are you...?

30:47.137 --> 30:49.096
We gotta stop it.
The numbers are bad.

30:50.641 --> 30:53.392
What are you doing?
Why'd you do that?

30:54.144 --> 30:57.772
Wait! The numbers are bad!
The numbers are bad!

30:57.856 --> 30:59.357
- The numbers are bad!
- Stop!

30:59.441 --> 31:01.567
- No, we can't!
- Hurley!

31:01.652 --> 31:03.528
- Get back!
- We can't. The numbers...

31:03.612 --> 31:05.738
You gotta get back.
You gotta get back.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.177
It's closer.
Give me the damn flare gun.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.304
- Hold on.
- It's closer. I'm telling you.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.432
I know, OK.
I've got one flare. One flare.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.393
OK. I know.
You don't see anything.

31:35.477 --> 31:39.146
What the hell are you expecting?
In case you haven't noticed, it's dark.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.191
- What is it? Is it a ship?
- We don't know, little man.

31:42.276 --> 31:43.609
Starboard? Port?

31:44.486 --> 31:46.445
Port. Port.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.407
What the hell am I supposed to do?

31:49.491 --> 31:52.201
Han. You and Chewie
wanna slow down and talk to me?

31:52.286 --> 31:55.329
- We have to fire the flare.
- We don't know what it is.

31:55.414 --> 31:59.000
It could be anything. Junk.
We don't know if Sayid's radar works.

31:59.084 --> 32:02.003
- He ever fix something that don't?
- It's moving away.

32:06.174 --> 32:09.260
- Junk knows how to steer?
- We're moving. It doesn't mean...

32:09.344 --> 32:12.555
Are you gonna give me the damn
gun or am I gonna have to take it?

32:13.181 --> 32:15.683
What're you gonna do?
Shoot me?

32:17.477 --> 32:19.103
It's almost gone!

32:31.325 --> 32:32.617
Come on!

32:36.038 --> 32:37.997
Please, God!

33:07.110 --> 33:09.779
It's coming back!
It's coming back!

33:13.992 --> 33:16.369
- Yes!
- Hell, yeah. OK?

33:16.453 --> 33:18.454
All right. OK. I know it.

34:19.683 --> 34:20.891
Ahoy!

34:21.643 --> 34:24.270
Oh, man, are we glad to see you.

34:24.353 --> 34:28.482
What's going on? What are you
folks doing this far out here?

34:28.567 --> 34:31.068
We were... we were
in the plane crash!

34:31.152 --> 34:33.737
We've been on an island
for a month, man.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.324
Plane crash, huh?
Well, how about that!

34:37.409 --> 34:41.704
We were on an island... flight 815...
Hey, where are we?

34:41.788 --> 34:44.206
Hey, it's a good thing we found you!

34:44.291 --> 34:47.793
We survived, and there's
a whole group of people on the island.

34:47.878 --> 34:51.172
- Well, ain't that something.
- Yeah.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.924
Only, the thing is,

34:54.009 --> 34:56.260
we're gonna have to take the boy.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.722
What? What'd you say?

34:59.806 --> 35:03.350
The boy.
We're gonna have to take him.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.448
Hey, what the hell's going on here?
Who are you people?

35:17.532 --> 35:19.700
Just give us the boy.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.540
I'm not giving you anybody.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.422
Well, all right then.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.761
No!

35:40.388 --> 35:43.974
- Dad! Dad!
- No! Walt, no!

35:47.646 --> 35:49.605
Dad, help!

36:00.200 --> 36:03.953
Dad, please. Help, Dad. Help me.

36:17.342 --> 36:21.178
Help me, Dad! Please!

36:28.854 --> 36:33.148
Walt! No!
