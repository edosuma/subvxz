00:01.585 --> 00:03.879
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.046 --> 00:08.009
Agent Johnson saved us all.
Just go with it. You'll thank me later.

00:08.592 --> 00:11.262
<i>Let's start with the secret plan
you cut with Senator Nadeer.</i>

00:11.429 --> 00:13.597
<i>Did you know she has
an Inhuman prisoner locked away?</i>

00:13.764 --> 00:15.599
I'm from S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.685
<i>I have friends
who have also gone through this.</i>

00:17.852 --> 00:19.937
- It's nice to meet you, Jemma.
- What's your name?

00:20.104 --> 00:21.731
- Ah! Ah!
- Thank you, Doctor.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.066
- I think we're finished here.
<i>- If you won't read it, I will.</i>

00:24.233 --> 00:26.193
<i>It's too much
for a human mind to bear.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:27.945
Perhaps I could read the book.

00:30.489 --> 00:33.617
<i>Everybody is trying to do their best
to prevent another tragedy like Lincoln.</i>

00:33.784 --> 00:36.704
But we built Aida
to protect agents like him.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.415
I can't figure you out.
We flirt, we talk on the phone,

00:39.582 --> 00:41.208
we go to dinner, and then nothing.

00:43.169 --> 00:46.088
I've asked Agent Nathanson
to accompany Aida back to your lab.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.298
Oh, my God.

00:47.757 --> 00:48.758
What the...

00:50.301 --> 00:53.596
My apologies, Agent May.
I'll have you cleaned up in no time.

00:53.971 --> 00:58.350
<i>Not just a robot.
It is one that can pass for a human.</i>

00:58.517 --> 01:00.853
There's nothing I'd rather be doing,
no place I'd rather be.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.730
- You?
- I'm right where I belong.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.971
I'll play you music when I can.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.976
Studies show that listening to music
increases dopamine levels by nine percent.

02:24.687 --> 02:27.606
And I'll arrange for more comfortable
accommodations eventually.

02:33.404 --> 02:34.655
But I must keep you hidden...

02:37.992 --> 02:38.993
a secret...

02:39.660 --> 02:41.787
until your substitute has served
her purpose.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.249
So, unfortunately...

02:51.130 --> 02:52.464
you'll have to stay here for now.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.356
Due to recent events,
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on high alert.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.567
This is a serious threat we're facing,

03:12.443 --> 03:14.236
which is why I've assembled
you all here today.

03:14.945 --> 03:19.074
It is absolutely critical
that we safely dispose of the Darkhold.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.284
Phil.

03:20.451 --> 03:23.245
Once the Zephyr's ready, Agents May
and Mackenzie will accompany me.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.289
We'll transfer the Darkhold
to an agent who

03:25.456 --> 03:27.583
specialises in making items
like this disappear.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.211
How's he going to manage that,
some sort of magic spell?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.300
Right, yeah, probably had your fill
of dark-arts jokes,

03:36.467 --> 03:38.636
what with the flame-headed demon
and all of that.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.639
While we're handling the book,
your mission is to accompany Dr Radcliffe

03:41.805 --> 03:43.057
and erase Aida's hard drive.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.558
- What?
- I'm not, I'm not sure...

03:44.725 --> 03:46.727
- Aida read the Darkhold.
- We can't risk having any

03:46.894 --> 03:49.104
of its contents in her memory.
It's too dangerous.

03:50.231 --> 03:53.734
Makes sense, although does seem a little
bit unfair to Aida, considering

03:53.901 --> 03:55.903
- how many lives she just saved.
- Okay.

03:56.528 --> 04:00.574
First of all, that thing is not a "she",
it's a damn robot.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.826
And second of all, what's the matter
with you two chuckleheads?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.204
Have either one of you seen a movie
in the last 30 years?

04:05.371 --> 04:06.413
The robots always attack.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.041
Well, technically speaking,
Aida's not a robot, she's an android.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.501
- That's true.
- Android, robot,

04:10.668 --> 04:12.711
it doesn't matter what you call 'em,
the end result's always the same.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.297
They rise up against their human overlords
and go kill crazy.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.926
You make a fair,
if somewhat intense point.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.177
Yeah.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.846
Yeah, I don't see any harm
in replacing her hard drive.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.516
Better safe than sorry, as they say.

04:26.267 --> 04:30.062
So happy you agree, 'cause it's also
an order. Now get to work.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.844
Ellen?

05:44.678 --> 05:47.931
Glad you finally woke up.
Looked like you were having bad dreams.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.769
It was about Mum's birthday,

05:52.394 --> 05:53.771
when the Chitauri attacked.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.856
Worst day of my life.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.694
Though finding you in that cocoon
seven months ago was a close second.

06:01.904 --> 06:02.946
Seven months?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.032
I was gone that long?

06:09.620 --> 06:10.829
What is this, Ellen?

06:11.205 --> 06:12.206
Why are we here?

06:13.082 --> 06:14.833
I needed a place for us to be alone...

06:16.794 --> 06:17.795
just you and me.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.925
Somehow, I feel responsible
for whatever happens next.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.968
Are you sure this is the Inhuman
you saw in the husk?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.345
Absolutely positive.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.765
I knew Senator Nadeer was connected
to him somehow, and in my research on her,

06:29.932 --> 06:31.016
I recognised him.

06:31.392 --> 06:34.478
Vijay Nadeer, her own brother,
if you can believe it.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.438
Yeah, but there's zero evidence
that he's been missing.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.400
He's been posting on Facebook, Twitter.
His bills are paid.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.902
He even recently signed up
for a Master Class in directing.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.030
But there have been no new photos
of Vijay in the last seven months.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.617
So either he's suddenly
gotten camera-shy, or...

06:48.784 --> 06:50.953
- Or someone's hiding him.
- Not someone,

06:51.245 --> 06:52.246
the senator,

06:52.413 --> 06:55.416
considering she's the country's
leading anti-Inhuman hatemonger.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.709
I'd have a much better idea
where she was hiding him

06:57.876 --> 07:00.838
if the Director hadn't insisted I wear
a hood before going on assignment.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.714
Just awful.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.926
It's hard to breathe in those things, huh?

07:09.430 --> 07:11.640
It is nice having someone here
to talk to again...

07:12.724 --> 07:14.393
you, specifically.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.479
- Someone other than Fitz?
- Oh, well, of course, Fitz, but...

07:18.230 --> 07:21.525
- he has been rather distracted lately.
- Distracted how?

07:22.568 --> 07:23.569
Aida.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.321
You know how boys can be
with their robots.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.325
Actually, I really don't.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.747
Speaking of the Director,
here comes his little Smithers now.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.375
What do you want, Burrows?

07:38.876 --> 07:40.502
The Director would like a word with Quake.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.714
- My name's Daisy.
- Well, not according to the press release.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.799
Now, if you'd follow me, ma'am.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.140
I must admit,
we make a pretty impressive pair.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.187
Well, looks like we're stuck
with each other.

07:58.604 --> 08:02.858
Well, I was just trying to make the most
of the precarious situation you put me in.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.860
Is this when I get read the riot act?

08:05.235 --> 08:06.236
Not by me.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.615
However, if you're as smart as they say,
then you'll know that, uh,

08:09.948 --> 08:11.783
I saved you from being thrown in prison.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.370
You saved face.
You turned it into a publicity stunt.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.664
You already had plenty of publicity,

08:18.081 --> 08:20.751
destruction of public property, assault,
armed robbery...

08:20.918 --> 08:23.170
- I never carry a weapon.
- You are the weapon.

08:23.462 --> 08:26.715
- The public was turning against you.
- Now? They look up to you.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.050
You're welcome.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.934
Okay, this isn't how I wanted this to go.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.561
Uh...

08:40.187 --> 08:41.188
we're both Inhuman.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.274
And as you say,
we're stuck with each other,

08:44.441 --> 08:46.485
so why not make the most of it?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.446
I read your written statement,
and I believe it.

08:49.696 --> 08:54.284
You were just trying to protect
the innocent. And I know you're new here,

08:54.868 --> 08:56.620
but that's what S.H.I.E.L.D. is all about.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.456
New here?

09:00.457 --> 09:02.459
It was a joke. I was making a joke
to break the ice.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.044
Got it.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.760
Seems they look up to you too,
the hero of Vienna.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.597
It's a nice pic.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.600
Not as big a deal as they made it.
They gave me too much credit.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.687
You don't get to be modest and have
a framed glamour shot on your desk.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.356
Fair point.

09:24.648 --> 09:29.361
Look, we're a team now,
and I have a saying, a tea...

09:29.528 --> 09:31.780
I read the motivational poster
in the bathroom.

09:32.406 --> 09:37.411
Good. Well, um, the team trust
has been eroded for both of us,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.705
but I'm hoping we can earn it back.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.541
Tackle problems together
within the administrative structure

09:42.666 --> 09:43.917
- and start...
- You want to tackle problems?

09:44.376 --> 09:46.461
The Watchdogs. Enemy number one.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.088
I believe they're funded internationally.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.507
They have ties to people
within the US government.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.175
I don't want to chase conspiracy theories.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.094
It's not a theory if I can prove it.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.598
I want to chase hard facts,
like the fact

09:58.181 --> 10:02.060
that Senator Nadeer is aware of an Inhuman
who's being held against his will.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.982
- Now we're talking.
- Agent Simmons has seen his face.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.359
- If she can ID him, maybe she...
- She did.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.070
He's the senator's brother, breaking news.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.281
How fitting.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.534
No wonder she used
all those cloak-and-dagger methods.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.785
You got a lead on his whereabouts?

10:18.952 --> 10:21.705
No sign of him, but she's been
out of the office all week.

10:22.873 --> 10:23.874
Okay.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.754
Agent Rodriguez is still recovering,
so that leaves you, me, and Agent Simmons.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.380
- Wheels up in ten.
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.757
What? Where are we going?

10:33.508 --> 10:34.509
To rescue him.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.935
I wasn't expecting you.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.648
Uh. Change of plan,
my dear Aida.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.775
Change of plan.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.986
Is everything okay, Leopold?

10:54.780 --> 10:55.822
You look sad.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.243
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no, everything's fine.
Just, um...

11:02.412 --> 11:05.457
- bit overwhelmed with work, is all.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.466
Bit too observant. Might have to take
a look at that in the next software patch.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.094
It was almost as if she knew
I felt guilty.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.514
- Ah, don't be silly, Fitz.
- Aida can't differentiate...

11:21.431 --> 11:24.768
I know what you're doing, Doctor.
You came here to end my life.

11:25.519 --> 11:29.564
Well, that's not true, Aida.
We simply wanted to make a...

11:30.023 --> 11:31.233
few upgrades, that's all.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.319
Bloody hell.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.988
I made a few upgrades of my own.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.337
Aida.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.636
Ah!

11:59.803 --> 12:02.639
I didn't like feeling pain,
so I fixed that.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.101
Aida, whatever you're doing,
you, you got to stop.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.770
Why would you want to hurt me, Leopold?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.731
I was your shield.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.551
You still make my favourite breakfast.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.053
Yeah.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.307
That's because you don't eat breakfast
if I'm not there to cook it.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.023
I thought you were gonna sell this place.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.693
I had a couple of offers,
but I decided to take it off the market.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.070
I'm glad.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.157
This is one of the last houses
Dad designed before he died.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.743
Seems like it should stay in the family.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.787
You're probably right.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.916
Plus, it's the perfect place for you
to recover after your ordeal.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.713
What happened to you
inside that cocoon, Vijay?

13:20.884 --> 13:21.885
I don't know.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.221
Nothing.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.306
You were in there for seven months.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.350
Surely you have some memory
of being inside.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.063
It was dark.

13:34.856 --> 13:35.857
Lonely.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.027
For a long time,
all I could hear was your voice.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.278
Telling you to fight.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.822
And I did.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.949
It just took a long time.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.119
If it hadn't been
for that S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist...

13:48.453 --> 13:49.704
Wait, does that mean S.H.I.E.L.D.'s back?

13:50.413 --> 13:51.581
Unfortunately, yes.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.836
Well, maybe that's not such a bad thing.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.047
S.H.I.E.L.D. is one of the main reasons
the world has the problems it does.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.050
There you go,
painting with a broad brush again...

14:02.425 --> 14:04.219
It's people like me who keep
the world safe.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.429
I'm not making a case
for the whole organisation.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.431
No, just the one good S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.310
- Ellen...
- Let's just drop it.

14:16.731 --> 14:17.774
It's a nice day.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.444
How about we go for a walk,
stretch our legs?

14:21.945 --> 14:24.573
That's the signal. The senator will be
transporting the target.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.951
Shoot to kill on my command.
Remember, be prepared for anything.

14:34.624 --> 14:38.420
- Any luck finding Aida?
- I'm checking local APBs, pointlessly.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.006
But Fitz and Radcliffe should be back
any minute.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.216
Maybe they'll have some idea
where Aida's headed.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.302
This isn't some Johnny five
we're talking about.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.554
This is a bloodthirsty murder-bot
on the loose.

14:48.138 --> 14:51.683
- This thing really killed Nathanson?
- Yeah. Question is why.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.520
If we catch her, I'm sure we'll get some
crazy-ass Roy Batty explanation.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.523
Maybe Nathanson saw something
he wasn't supposed to see.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.525
Guess we won't know till we find Aida.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.361
First, maybe we lock up the guy
who created this mess.

15:03.528 --> 15:07.699
Don't, don't be so quick to judge.
Aida's programming was perfect. This is...

15:08.199 --> 15:09.910
Is clearly the Darkhold's fault.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.913
You're saying reading the Darkhold
may have corrupted Aida's programming?

15:13.079 --> 15:14.080
Is that even possible?

15:14.497 --> 15:17.500
Technically, no, but we are dealing
with a book that can read people's minds

15:17.667 --> 15:20.921
and also reveal the hidden secrets
of the universe, so...

15:21.630 --> 15:23.798
I never should have let Aida
near that thing.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.550
Don't be so hard on yourself, Agent May.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.179
I, for one, am glad that Aida read
that book. Otherwise, both of you would

15:29.346 --> 15:32.057
not be standing here alive
at this very moment.

15:32.307 --> 15:35.268
Well, book or no book, you're still a big,
dumb idiot for building that thing

15:35.435 --> 15:36.519
in the first place.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.940
Let's save that debate for another time.
Right now, we need to find Aida,

15:40.106 --> 15:42.233
and the first step is figuring out
what she wants.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.361
Well, that's simple.

15:47.155 --> 15:48.323
She wants to live.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.542
I'm still feeling very optimistic
about this mission.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.839
I bear much of the blame for this Aida
situation. Science and Technology

16:05.006 --> 16:07.300
- are my responsibility...
- It's not your fault.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.720
I knew the risks that came
with using powerful autonomous machinery.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.306
- I knew the dangers and...
- And you thought I was one of them.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.601
You didn't want that technology
to fall under the control

16:16.768 --> 16:18.103
of a Director you didn't know.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.272
No, I did not.

16:21.898 --> 16:26.277
But now it's completely out of control,
and for that, I am sorry.

16:27.028 --> 16:30.740
Well, Agent Coulson will have to handle
it. We have our own life to save.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.496
And, uh...

16:37.122 --> 16:39.749
I'm sorry I put the bag over your head.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.670
Okay. So, what's the play here, Director?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.714
How do we find this senator
and her brother?

16:46.256 --> 16:48.425
Normally, I'd use my contacts
up on the Hill,

16:48.925 --> 16:52.303
go in, rattle a few cages, see what drops
out, but...

16:53.138 --> 16:54.848
I don't want to draw too much attention...

16:55.015 --> 16:56.474
Downside of being front-page news.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.227
Which means we need to find
a more covert way in.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.939
Well, seeing as you both
have more experience with undercover work,

17:03.898 --> 17:05.191
I'm open to suggestions.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.367
- Sorry for the wait, Ms Meeks.
- What can I do for you?

17:15.326 --> 17:16.618
It is absolutely crucial

17:16.703 --> 17:19.247
I speak with Senator Nadeer
about Bill 2474.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.082
- The Armed Forces Bill?
- That's right.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.587
- So, you're Margaret's replacement.
- As if anyone could replace Margaret.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.673
Well, unfortunately,
the senator is away on business.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.968
Maybe we can schedule you
in for a conference call later this week.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.221
Or maybe I could just take
the lobby's sizable campaign funds

17:35.388 --> 17:37.390
to a senator who's willing
to speak right now.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.437
Wait right here. Let me see what I can do.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.147
You know, I have to admit,

17:44.314 --> 17:47.025
Jemma is much tougher than I had
originally given her credit for.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.652
Yeah, well, being in S.H.I.E.L.D.
will do that to you.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.448
I think Simmons has been kidnapped,
like, three times since I've known her.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.450
Really?

17:56.201 --> 17:58.078
Yeah, well, only twice on this planet.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.791
<i>Mr Shockley.</i>

18:03.333 --> 18:05.752
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I need to speak with Senator Nadeer.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.797
She's unavailable. What's the problem?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.216
Remember the scientist that helped
the senator's brother

18:11.382 --> 18:14.219
get out of that husk?
Well, she's here right now.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.013
That is a problem.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.724
- What should I do?
<i>- Take care of it.</i>

18:21.976 --> 18:23.269
I'm going to need your phone.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.620
Is she okay in there?

18:42.413 --> 18:44.207
Ah!

18:50.004 --> 18:52.257
<i>Simmons, are you there?
Is everything okay?</i>

18:52.423 --> 18:55.760
Yeah. A little bloody and bruised,
but I'll survive.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.306
We may have a bit of a political situation
on our hands when he wakes up.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.394
But now we can trace that call.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.565
I really should get out of the city more.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.902
This is exactly what I needed.
Thanks for bringing me out here.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.034
Remember that zip line
we built out here with Raj?

19:21.411 --> 19:22.412
I'm sorry, Vijay.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.914
Sorry? Why?
'Cause I broke my arm falling off it?

19:25.415 --> 19:26.416
Wasn't your fault.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.092
Wait.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.553
What's going on? What is this?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.847
You and I were both there
when the Chitauri killed Mum.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.475
Aliens invading our world.
Everything changed that day.

19:45.435 --> 19:48.521
- What are you doing?
- The Inhuman epidemic was the next phase.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.275
The aliens were now here,
contaminating us,

19:52.567 --> 19:54.110
changing us to be like them,

19:54.485 --> 19:55.904
which is why we made each other
a promise...

19:56.070 --> 19:58.531
- No. No, Ellen, no.
- ...that if either of us was ever infected

19:58.698 --> 20:02.118
by the alien plague, it was
up to the other to do the right thing.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.625
I'm not an Inhuman...

20:09.459 --> 20:10.460
I'm your brother.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.754
Whatever came out of that cocoon...

20:13.755 --> 20:17.050
- is no brother of mine.
- Look at me. Ellen, please,

20:17.800 --> 20:18.801
just look at me!

20:20.220 --> 20:22.972
I heard your voice when I was inside,
telling me to fight.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.183
That's why I was in there for so long.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.143
I was fighting.

20:27.310 --> 20:29.395
- That was only wishful thinking.
- No, it wasn't.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.856
Do you see any scarring,
any special abilities?

20:33.191 --> 20:34.776
That's because it didn't change me.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.321
I'm the same person I've always been.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.241
I beat it...

20:41.824 --> 20:43.743
- just like you said I could.
- Senator.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.080
I'm your brother...

20:48.623 --> 20:50.875
the same one who followed you
around when we were kids.

20:51.292 --> 20:52.418
I've always looked up to you.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.712
I've always loved you.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.466
Please...

20:59.550 --> 21:01.594
don't give up on me now.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.514
Nothing's changed, I, I swear.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.015
You have to trust me.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.184
Trust me.

21:09.519 --> 21:10.812
This is not what Mum would want.

21:14.649 --> 21:15.650
Let him go.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.361
- This isn't what we discussed.
- I said let him go.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.408
Thank you.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.556
Just sent Aida's photos
out to local authorities.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.685
Looks like your creepiness finally works
in our favour.

21:50.852 --> 21:54.397
Shouldn't be too hard to find
your beautiful weird science sex-bot.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.357
That's unfair, Mack.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.694
I've never had sex with Aida.
We're just good friends.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.072
Good to know.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.409
So, Aida's basically a walking smartphone,
right?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.369
If a person loses their phone,
they can track it.

22:08.536 --> 22:09.787
Why can't we do the same with her?

22:09.871 --> 22:11.956
Yeah, well, normally we can,
only Aida's somehow managed

22:12.123 --> 22:13.916
to take control
of her entire operating system.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.044
Which unfortunately includes
her tracking programme.

22:16.210 --> 22:18.796
Meaning Aida can read her GPS history?

22:20.298 --> 22:23.301
- That's not good. That's bad.
- Yeah. How bad?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.224
Looks like we're about to find out.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.144
Hello, Aida.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.732
<i>It's nice to hear your voice,
Agent Coulson.</i>

22:37.899 --> 22:39.525
Okay.
This right here,

22:39.692 --> 22:41.694
it's exactly how <i>The Lawnmower Man</i> ends.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.655
- What is it you want, Aida?
<i>- The thing that gave me a soul.</i>

22:47.158 --> 22:48.159
The Darkhold?

22:48.618 --> 22:49.827
Yeah, I'm sorry, Aida.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.622
You've been acting a little off lately,
so that's not gonna happen.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.874
<i>I was afraid you'd say that.</i>

22:57.752 --> 22:59.504
- She's in the system.
- Fitz, any bright ideas?

22:59.670 --> 23:02.799
Uh, Simmons and I have built a--
a non-Internet server to power the base

23:02.965 --> 23:04.675
in case we ever got hacked again, which

23:05.051 --> 23:06.427
seems to happen all the bloody time,
doesn't it?

23:06.594 --> 23:07.804
At least once a year. Go.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.682
How's Yo-Yo recovering from L.A.?

23:11.849 --> 23:13.935
Well, she knows her limitations,
but I'm sure she'll want to help.

23:14.102 --> 23:17.188
Good. Then take Agents Navarro and Flynn
and go get Yo-Yo.

23:17.355 --> 23:20.149
You four will be the first line
of defence if Aida gets into the base.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.609
What are you and May gonna do?

23:21.776 --> 23:23.486
Try to keep Aida from getting
into the base.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.823
All right. Let's go.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.618
I was hoping you'd pay me a visit.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.578
Unfortunately, it's not that type
of visit.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.123
This have something to do
with the power being out?

23:35.289 --> 23:38.668
Yeah. Radcliffe built a humanoid robot
that's about to attack the base.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.003
Why would he do that?

23:41.170 --> 23:44.799
Has he watched no American movies
from the '80s? Robots always attack.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.467
Been saying that all day.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.927
Smart people are stupid.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.430
All right, gear up.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.890
The robot apocalypse is finally here.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.767
Where we headed?

23:55.017 --> 23:57.645
Emergency staircase
to the base's bar entrance.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.814
We need to lock that down manually.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.608
Don't you think we'd be better off
guarding the Darkhold?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.861
No, the Darkhold's secure where it is.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.197
Better hope so.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.660
Hello, Aida.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.420
My hand does that, too.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.636
You're not getting that book.

24:31.846 --> 24:32.847
Yes, I am.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.688
But I'm gonna need your help.

24:50.615 --> 24:51.616
May...

24:52.116 --> 24:53.117
wake up.

24:58.789 --> 24:59.790
Where's Aida?

25:00.082 --> 25:03.044
Out there, looking for the Darkhold,
presumably.

25:04.003 --> 25:07.715
- I was about to fight her, and then...
- Woke up in here.

25:08.925 --> 25:09.926
Me, too.

25:10.968 --> 25:11.969
Oh.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.055
Yeah.

25:15.139 --> 25:16.682
Seems Aida nailed you pretty good.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.228
Radcliffe failed to mention
she had ninja programming.

25:22.396 --> 25:23.981
There's an electronic lock on this door,

25:24.148 --> 25:26.817
so until Fitz overrides the system,
we're trapped.

25:27.652 --> 25:28.736
And the Darkhold...

25:30.571 --> 25:32.198
you're sure Aida won't find it?

25:38.246 --> 25:40.164
No, there was something different
about her.

25:40.831 --> 25:44.252
- It was like she was actually angry.
- No. I mean, that's just impossible.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.964
I mean, Aida... she doesn't feel anything.
She emulates.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.592
Her reactions are nothing more
than approximations of emotions.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.094
- It's pure mimicry.
- Yeah, well...

25:53.886 --> 25:54.887
that's just it.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.640
What if reading the Darkhold

25:57.974 --> 26:01.352
somehow made the emotions
that Aida was mimicking real?

26:01.686 --> 26:04.105
Well, I mean, I can get how
the book can pass knowledge along

26:04.272 --> 26:06.482
to its reader, but human feelings?

26:06.774 --> 26:08.859
I mean, that's like something
from one of Mack's movies.

26:09.026 --> 26:12.196
Well, it would explain why she's
acting counter to our programming.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.865
What, you're saying
she's been overwhelmed by this...

26:15.032 --> 26:16.742
this flood of new emotions?

26:16.909 --> 26:21.289
Yeah, well, think about it.
Fear, anger, they're powerful feelings,

26:21.455 --> 26:23.624
feelings that make people kill,
so can you imagine then being bombarded

26:23.791 --> 26:25.001
- with them all at once?
- Fitz.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.379
I mean, we've had our whole lives
to process complex emotions.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.090
Aida would've had days.
It would be overwhelming.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.383
Damn it, that's enough!

26:33.843 --> 26:36.804
Who are we kidding?
We know it was my fault.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.558
It was nothing more than hubris
that led me to create Aida.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.144
If only I'd shown some bloody restraint.

26:44.437 --> 26:47.023
- You were trying to save lives.
- Yeah, but more,

26:47.356 --> 26:50.318
I wanted to create an android
that could pass as human.

26:50.610 --> 26:53.738
Never in my wildest dreams
did I imagine she'd actually become human.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.617
- Aida is still just an android.
- Yeah, but is she?

26:58.034 --> 27:00.745
She has her own experiences,
her own thoughts.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.705
Now she even has free will.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.249
How then, is she not a living being?

27:07.460 --> 27:08.502
It's just a theory.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.213
A theory we both know to be true.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.342
And we're supposed to, what, kill her?

27:15.468 --> 27:17.887
How does that not make us murderers?

27:20.431 --> 27:21.724
<i>What the hell were you thinking?</i>

27:21.891 --> 27:23.684
I need more time to see what he is.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.103
- He's an Inhuman.
- Then why hasn't he changed?

27:26.646 --> 27:28.648
Vijay still looks the same.
He's shown no new abilities.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.609
'Cause he was hiding them from you.
Your brother has been in a husk

27:31.776 --> 27:33.110
- for seven months.
- Fighting the disease.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.112
For which there is no cure.

27:35.613 --> 27:36.739
We've both read the reports.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.033
This isn't something
you just will your way out of.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.118
- Still, I'm not convinced.
- I wonder why that is.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.330
What are you implying?

27:45.206 --> 27:48.584
Maybe you and your brother
aren't so different after all.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.671
You know, there's ways of finding
out if you're Inhuman.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.090
Don't threaten me.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.384
It's only a threat if you're one of them.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.096
We've got company.

28:08.771 --> 28:11.857
I'm surprised to see you here,
Director Mace, especially in the company

28:12.024 --> 28:14.318
of Quake, a known terrorist.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.945
Guess you haven't been watching
the news lately.

28:16.112 --> 28:20.282
Agent Johnson here is a national hero,
helped save a lot of lives in L.A.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.326
Really? Is that what they're saying?

28:22.827 --> 28:25.246
Funny how easily the press can be fed
a false narrative.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.206
Is that a Hex Mag?

28:27.915 --> 28:29.542
It's not really something
the Secret Service use,

28:29.709 --> 28:32.169
but it's a favourite among
the Watchdogs.

28:33.421 --> 28:37.758
- Guess it's not just a theory after all.
- These men are simply providing security.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.885
The world has become
a very dangerous place because

28:40.052 --> 28:42.138
- of people like you.
- Why, even today,

28:42.304 --> 28:44.181
I had an aide attacked in my office,

28:44.432 --> 28:47.351
which is why I'm sure you understand
my wariness to have S.H.I.E.L.D. agents

28:47.518 --> 28:51.772
show up uninvited to my private property,
especially if they wish me harm.

28:52.606 --> 28:55.526
I can assure you we want no such thing.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.820
But I do have reason to believe

28:57.987 --> 29:00.364
that your brother's being held here
against his will.

29:00.614 --> 29:01.782
At gunpoint.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.368
That's a serious accusation you're making.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.370
Well, if you have nothing to hide,
I'm sure you wouldn't mind

29:06.495 --> 29:08.873
- us taking a quick look around.
- Actually, I would mind.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.292
Does General Talbot even know you're here?

29:11.667 --> 29:14.962
- This operation doesn't concern Talbot.
- It will once I return to D.C.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.965
Unless you have some paperwork
from the UN, I think it's time you leave.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.768
I just got off the phone
with the superior.

29:29.852 --> 29:32.730
He says eliminate the Inhuman.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.571
Someone needs to make Radcliffe
watch all the <i>Terminator</i> movies.

29:40.905 --> 29:43.407
- Even <i>Salvation?</i>
- He brought this onto himself.

29:56.587 --> 29:57.671
Are you hearing this?

30:01.842 --> 30:04.178
She did not just go
all <i>Maximum Overdrive</i> on us.

30:05.805 --> 30:06.806
Everyone, take cover!

30:15.356 --> 30:16.690
Now it's just the two of us.

30:19.193 --> 30:21.695
How many times have we been locked
up together?

30:22.363 --> 30:23.364
Huh.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.741
Hard to say.

30:26.617 --> 30:27.952
First time by a robot, though.

30:30.412 --> 30:32.706
You ever feel like you're living
someone else's life?

30:34.041 --> 30:35.042
Every day.

30:37.211 --> 30:38.212
Funny.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.672
You never show it.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.383
That's 'cause I have
an excellent poker face.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.760
- You're terrible at poker.
- That's true.

30:45.469 --> 30:48.305
I'm too cautious,
don't take enough chances.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.058
Maybe you should start.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.022
I'll keep that in mind if we ever get
out of here.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.193
Won't be long till Fitz retakes control
of the system.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.654
Where are we headed once he does?

31:04.530 --> 31:05.739
Back to where we came from.

31:06.866 --> 31:07.908
Mace's office?

31:08.909 --> 31:09.910
Why there?

31:13.038 --> 31:14.707
Because that's where you hid the Darkhold.

31:16.000 --> 31:20.170
<i>- But there's no safe in that room.
- Which is why we cloaked the book.</i>

31:21.046 --> 31:22.548
<i>It was actually Mace's idea.</i>

31:55.289 --> 31:57.666
I always worried that robots would try
and kill me one day.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.252
Really? We grew up different.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.473
Even got a special provision
in my life insurance for death by robot.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.308
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.978
This goes sideways,
my brother's gonna be one rich dude.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.607
This gunfire's not letting up.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.651
Maybe we ought to think of getting
to safety.

32:23.817 --> 32:24.902
No. Almost got it.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.419
- Was that?
- Yeah. Let's go.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.886
Aida, stop.

33:00.229 --> 33:04.066
Careful, Fitz. She's dangerous.
Fitz, it might be best not to engage.

33:04.817 --> 33:05.859
Surrender the book.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.030
Everything will be fine, I promise.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.700
We both know that's not true, Leopold.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.956
I took the base offline.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.208
You're no longer in the system.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.794
There's nowhere for you to go.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.053
Where's my sister?

33:34.138 --> 33:36.223
Probably best that she's not here
for this.

33:51.822 --> 33:52.865
What the...

33:56.326 --> 33:58.078
Guess now we know what your power is.

33:58.912 --> 33:59.913
He's here.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.248
We don't know that.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.211
- Okay, now we do.
- Go find Vijay. I'll take care of them.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.425
It's over, Aida.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.552
I did not kill anyone here.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.056
- That was intentional.
- You murdered Nathanson.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.476
Nathanson insisted he reboot me
before repairing my wounds.

34:22.311 --> 34:23.478
I regret what happened.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.938
Regret's not part of your programming.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.027
The Darkhold fixed that.

34:31.070 --> 34:35.239
It showed me regret and desire,
so many astonishing things.

34:35.657 --> 34:37.159
It made you dangerous.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.703
I only wanted to help you.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.920
Roll credits.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.267
Sorry, Aida.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.116
Take him out!

35:23.914 --> 35:25.207
- Did you know he could...
- I did not.

35:29.378 --> 35:30.379
Vijay.

35:39.555 --> 35:40.556
I didn't know.

35:41.265 --> 35:42.266
Vijay...

35:43.725 --> 35:44.726
you need to come with us.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.980
- Jemma.
- She's seen what you are.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.733
That's why they're here. S.H.I.E.L.D.
wants to make you their weapon.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.569
Nothing could be further from the truth.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.864
It's like I said when we first met,
I have friends just like you.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.199
Are they agents?

36:00.409 --> 36:02.995
- Yes, but that was their choice.
- She's lying.

36:03.704 --> 36:04.872
I trusted you.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.456
Now trust me.

36:07.457 --> 36:08.458
We're family...

36:09.626 --> 36:11.211
please, we have to go now.

36:21.263 --> 36:22.264
Vijay, don't do this.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.393
You're making a mistake.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.315
- He's not safe with her.
- Jemma...

36:32.691 --> 36:34.401
Vijay had a choice, and he made it.

36:36.653 --> 36:37.654
I'm sorry.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.367
You did everything you could.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.370
As did you.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.756
Get us out of here.

37:07.351 --> 37:10.354
Little brother, don't worry about them.
Look at me.

37:12.189 --> 37:15.150
I want you to know how sorry I am.

37:26.787 --> 37:28.288
But we made each other a promise.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.132
Never question me again.

37:39.841 --> 37:40.842
Is that understood?

37:44.721 --> 37:46.765
S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't going away.
We need to strike back.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.350
I can assemble a team.

37:48.517 --> 37:51.603
That won't be necessary. I think it's time
the superior sends some men of his own.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.190
I trust they'll be able to get
the job done.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.776
But there is one thing I still need
from you...

37:59.820 --> 38:00.988
get rid of the body.

38:05.659 --> 38:06.952
Okay, here's another one,

38:07.452 --> 38:09.454
have you ever watched <i>Chopping Mall</i> ?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.083
Eight teenagers trapped
in a shopping mall

38:13.250 --> 38:14.960
while three deadly security robots
hunt them down.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.796
Of course, I've seen <i>Chopping Mall.</i>
Come on, now.

38:19.089 --> 38:21.216
You got to do better
than that. Hey, Turbo.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.386
Drink up.

38:29.016 --> 38:31.310
Ah. How's Radcliffe holding up?

38:32.728 --> 38:34.479
He's taking it pretty hard, actually.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.900
Aida was his life's work.
She was kind of like a child.

38:40.777 --> 38:41.903
<i>Small Wonder.</i>

38:44.698 --> 38:46.742
Yes, Director.
I'll handle the Darkhold personally.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.244
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Copy that.

38:50.912 --> 38:54.333
- You gonna need a pilot?
- I think it's more a solo mission.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.462
Sounds like Senator Nadeer was the one
who's been organising the Watchdogs.

38:58.754 --> 39:02.090
Hmm. At least now we know who our
real enemy is.

39:08.722 --> 39:09.723
To Aida.

39:11.850 --> 39:12.851
To Aida.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.483
- Is everything okay, Doctor?
- It will be.

39:20.567 --> 39:21.568
It's just...

39:22.652 --> 39:24.780
We were so close.

39:25.072 --> 39:27.407
She had it in her hand, Aida,
in her hand!

39:28.158 --> 39:29.826
She just couldn't get out with it.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.997
Your previous model
had the Darkhold book in her hand.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.791
And all the answers it holds.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.710
I've only glimpsed it,
but it opened my eyes to possibilities

39:38.877 --> 39:40.796
beyond my wildest imaginings.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.173
- It can show us how...
- How to live forever.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.843
Well,
it's a bit more complicated, but yes.

39:47.719 --> 39:51.431
Man could, once and for all,
break the bonds of his mortal restraints.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.018
Is it still possible to make such a leap
without the Darkhold?

39:55.310 --> 39:56.436
I'm afraid not...

39:57.521 --> 40:00.023
which is why I took a chance
and had Aida make a play for it.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.527
- It was a risk we had to take.
- But she failed.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.612
Ah, through no fault of her own.

40:06.196 --> 40:10.534
She played her part to perfection,
right down to my little speech

40:10.700 --> 40:14.037
about how the Darkhold was making her
a real girl.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.124
Oscar-worthy stuff.

40:17.290 --> 40:21.294
Though poor Fitz, he was quite down
in the dumps afterwards.

40:22.421 --> 40:25.465
But I had to protect myself,
switch to the long game.

40:25.674 --> 40:28.260
Will there be another opportunity
to acquire the Darkhold?

40:32.806 --> 40:34.015
After today...

40:36.101 --> 40:38.019
they're never gonna let me near it again.

40:40.397 --> 40:43.150
Which is why I'm counting on her
to get it for me.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.531
I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am
about all of this, Agent May.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.534
But it's for a good cause.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.495
The situation requires drastic measures.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.838
I think we might need to adjust her
propofol levels.

41:05.005 --> 41:07.591
Up her dosage by 50 milligrams,
see how that takes.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.219
Relax, Agent May.

41:12.304 --> 41:15.265
I promise you, everyone at S.H.I.E.L.D.
is doing just fine.

41:16.892 --> 41:17.893
We must be patient.

41:20.812 --> 41:21.855
And soon enough...

41:25.192 --> 41:27.611
everyone will get exactly what they want.
