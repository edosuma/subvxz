00:39.340 --> 00:42.608
  Carly, there's this terrible
     rumour floating around

00:42.643 --> 00:44.610
  that today is your last day.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.944
            [sighs]

00:45.980 --> 00:47.579
       Alison, I'm afraid
        that it's true.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.783
    You haven't seen Nicole,
           have you?

00:50.818 --> 00:53.652
  She was supposed to give me
      my exit interview.

00:53.687 --> 00:58.323
 Well, perhaps we could call it
     an "exit discussion."

00:58.359 --> 01:00.292
   It's not every day you get
      your exit interview

01:00.327 --> 01:02.761
 from the owner of the resort.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.563
      So what's your plan?

01:04.598 --> 01:07.166
  I'm going back to my family
       business at home.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.134
I know how much work it can be.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.736
   My parents made this place
          what it is,

01:10.771 --> 01:14.106
        I've just tried
       to keep it alive.

01:14.141 --> 01:17.309
So you have been our assistant
event planner for about a year,

01:17.344 --> 01:19.611
     and you're going back
       to Europe, right?

01:19.647 --> 01:22.948
  A small country in the Alps
    no one's ever heard of.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.818
  Oh, one of those ones where
    they still have a king?

01:25.853 --> 01:27.953
    He's more like a mayor.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.522
  So, is Nicole, is she going
       to be joining us?

01:30.558 --> 01:33.158
   Uh, Nicole quit after her
    boyfriend got that job

01:33.194 --> 01:34.860
      in Denver this fall.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.762
She wanted to be closer to him.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.997
       Well, I knew that
        she missed him,

01:39.033 --> 01:40.599
     but with Snowden Fest
      in just a few days

01:40.634 --> 01:42.301
      and the sleigh ride
      and the ice rink...

01:42.336 --> 01:43.235
   Well, from what I've seen,

01:43.270 --> 01:44.670
    you have all the events
      pretty dialled in.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.038
       But the Snowball,
     the 50th anniversary,

01:46.073 --> 01:48.207
    Nicole, she was handling
       that all herself.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.975
            Well...

01:50.010 --> 01:52.444
    Oh, Alison, I would love
           to stay...

01:52.480 --> 01:54.880
      Great. I'll get you
      a new plane ticket.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.782
 I... I'm afraid it's a little
      bit more than that.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.585
      You see, my father
    and my brother, they...

02:00.988 --> 02:03.322
      I haven't been home
       in almost a year.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.190
     And you know how it is
         with family...

02:05.226 --> 02:06.825
     You have to be there.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.029
   I like the way you think.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.198
      Do you remember what
    you wrote on your resume

02:13.234 --> 02:15.334
      before I hired you?

02:15.369 --> 02:16.602
          "Objective.

02:16.637 --> 02:21.974
"To create inspiring events that
 bring the community together."

02:22.009 --> 02:23.509
    Do you feel like you've
        achieved that?

02:23.544 --> 02:25.944
  No, I was never really given
          that chance.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.881
      So what if you were?

02:32.219 --> 02:34.052
  <i> Welcome to Aspen, Charlie.</i>

02:34.088 --> 02:35.854
    <i> This is the first time</i>
      <i> a general manager</i>

02:35.890 --> 02:38.323
 <i> has even bothered to meet me</i>
       <i> on my first day.</i>

02:38.359 --> 02:40.692
        [car door slams]

02:40.728 --> 02:43.562
 This townhouse is in the folio
   you'll be managing for us.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.864
     Thanks for showing me
around like this, Mr. Mitchner.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.766
I meet all my new hires, David.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.034
        Come on inside.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.802
     I'll show you around.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.439
     Hey, I'm curious, uh,
    what's the culture like?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.542
   It seems like you can get
      lost pretty easily

02:56.577 --> 02:57.910
      at a place this big.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.545
   Three times my first week.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.779
     You just have to look
        at the upsides

03:00.814 --> 03:02.548
  of working at a big resort.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.949
             Yeah?

03:03.984 --> 03:06.351
   Yeah, we have three shifts
    of people working 24/7.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.754
    So, when you clock out,
        you clock out.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.589
     Your free time belongs
            to you.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.125
    Oh, so you actually get
      to see your family?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.426
     I see them when I can.

03:14.461 --> 03:18.230
         [phone rings]

03:18.265 --> 03:20.832
       Speaking of which,
       that's my sister.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.040
            [laughs]

03:28.075 --> 03:29.274
           Nice hat.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.542
       More of a memento.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.777
       It used to belong
        to my roommate.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.945
     This girl named Carly?

03:32.980 --> 03:33.946
              Mmm.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.114
    Then she had to go back
    to her family in Europe.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.950
 No one's more bummed about it
           than me.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.751
 Brittany, Alison just asked me
     to plan the Snowball.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.953
        Are you kidding?

03:40.988 --> 03:43.455
   It's the 50th anniversary,
people are coming from all over,

03:43.490 --> 03:47.192
       there's a band...
   don't tell me you said no.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.928
    You'd only have to stay
       a few more days,

03:49.964 --> 03:51.463
      what's stopping you?

03:51.498 --> 03:53.432
    Just a little something
      called "My Father."

03:53.467 --> 03:55.300
    He wants me to do things
         "by the book."

03:55.336 --> 03:56.735
     Ah, "the book" again.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.503
   You have to give me a copy
       one of these days.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.339
   No, it is a terrible gift.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.075
   It tells you how to dress,
         how to speak,

04:03.110 --> 04:05.978
   and the exact day you need
        to fly home by.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.680
       What if you, like,
        lost that page?

04:08.716 --> 04:11.450
 I'm serious, would it kill you
          to ask him?

04:15.122 --> 04:17.255
        [phone ringing]

04:17.291 --> 04:18.656
           Hey, Ali.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.259
 Sorry, uh, I missed your call.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.628
        Quick question,
     how many vacation days

04:22.663 --> 04:24.429
    have you got stored up?

04:24.465 --> 04:25.931
           <i> [laughs]</i>
             <i> Why?</i>

04:25.966 --> 04:27.432
      <i> Is everything okay?</i>

04:27.468 --> 04:29.134
      I got some bad news.

04:29.169 --> 04:33.839
   Nicole quit, and the 50th
 anniversary ball is coming up.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.375
Uh, is there anything I can do?

04:36.410 --> 04:38.343
   <i> Well, I could really use</i>
          <i> your help,</i>

04:38.379 --> 04:40.212
even if it's only for a week....

04:40.247 --> 04:42.147
            <i> Or two.</i>

04:42.182 --> 04:44.950
     Me? You want me there?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.486
   <i> Why are you so surprised?</i>

04:47.521 --> 04:49.021
              I...

04:50.024 --> 04:51.823
   <i> You just always seem to</i>
<i>have everything under control.</i>

04:51.859 --> 04:53.225
          <i> That's all.</i>

04:53.260 --> 04:55.394
       Jesse, I need you.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.461
          Are you in?

05:01.769 --> 05:03.302
        <i> Father, please.</i>

05:03.337 --> 05:04.803
           <i> Carlotta.</i>

05:04.838 --> 05:06.305
  The whole reason I gave you
          a year off

05:06.340 --> 05:08.674
    to work at Snowden Peak,
           was to...

05:08.709 --> 05:10.642
    ...Accomplish something
          on my own.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.711
   Get real life experience.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.579
    And to work at a place
    where it doesn't matter

05:14.615 --> 05:16.214
      whose daughter I am.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.883
And did you not get to do that?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.084
       Well, not really.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.820
 Most of my time here was spent
   following my boss's lead,

05:21.855 --> 05:24.156
    but now that she's gone,
   they're giving me a chance

05:24.191 --> 05:27.192
to work on something really big.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.028
  There's no way I could stay
    just a few days longer?

05:30.064 --> 05:31.730
       But we three have
       always celebrated

05:31.765 --> 05:33.565
    your birthday together.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.901
 Can't you ask Gus to postpone
       just a few days?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.536
      Your brother is not
         the only one

05:37.571 --> 05:39.838
     who's looking forward
        to seeing you.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.773
    Father, I may never get
      this chance again.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.610
 It's less than two weeks, and
 it's really important to me.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.112
            [sighs]

05:47.147 --> 05:48.613
   If your conscience says...

05:48.649 --> 05:50.015
     Thank you! Thank you!

05:50.050 --> 05:52.050
      You won't regret it,
         I promise you.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.385
     I hope not, Carlotta.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.253
           Love you.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.055
           [whispers]
              Yes!

06:10.671 --> 06:12.070
        Wait, your hat.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.608
           Look out!

06:19.780 --> 06:21.246
         Are you okay?

06:21.281 --> 06:22.948
        Yeah, thank you.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.753
             Here.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.621
           Thank you.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.957
 Well, welcome to Snowden Peak.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.925
        Enjoy your stay.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.328
            Thanks.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.729
              Bye.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.598
              Bye.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.812
            <i> Alison!</i>

06:53.847 --> 06:55.514
  <i> Ah, thanks for meeting me,</i>
            <i> Carly.</i>

06:55.549 --> 06:58.750
<i>I was just informed the pipes</i>
<i>broke and the ballroom flooded.</i>

06:58.786 --> 06:59.985
            Just...

07:01.722 --> 07:05.957
     Did you already change
       your plane ticket?

07:05.993 --> 07:09.027
  Cause... we're going to need
         another venue

07:09.062 --> 07:11.463
     for the Snowball Gala.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.200
          Don't worry.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.835
   Pipes burst all the time.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.937
  The Snowball is in 10 days.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.373
 So, we'll find another venue.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.674
             Jesse?

07:22.709 --> 07:23.942
              Hi.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.177
 I thought you weren't coming!

07:25.212 --> 07:26.845
   I'm so happy you're here!

07:26.880 --> 07:28.713
       <i> I thought I would</i>
         <i> surprise you.</i>

07:28.749 --> 07:31.183
       Oh, this is great.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.686
   And Carly here has agreed
 to stay another few days, too.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.288
              Oh!

07:36.323 --> 07:38.223
      Uh, Jesse Mitchner.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.791
           Mitchner?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.194
    In case you can't tell,
   Jesse is my baby brother.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.862
   Except, when you're older
           than 10,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.564
         uh, people say
       "younger brother."

07:45.599 --> 07:47.232
  <i> ...Who loves correcting me.</i>

07:47.267 --> 07:50.302
     Well, welcome... back.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.070
           Thank you.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.873
Jesse is the GM at Aspen Grand.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.741
    I had some vacation time
           saved up,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.310
     and when Alison said
    that you couldn't stay,

07:58.345 --> 07:59.811
    I drove up to help out.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.580
    Oh, well, you're a very
       dutiful brother.

08:01.615 --> 08:02.714
             Um...

08:02.749 --> 08:03.849
             What?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.016
     Oh, come on. I visit.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.151
            Do you?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.252
        Uh... So, Carly.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.320
    Uh, where are you from?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.321
           Europe...

08:09.356 --> 08:10.088
       Uh, so, Alison...

08:10.123 --> 08:11.156
          Which part?

08:11.191 --> 08:11.890
            Central.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.991
         So, Alison...

08:13.026 --> 08:13.992
 You've done a really good job
    at losing your accent.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.861
       Uh, four years of
   American boarding school.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.196
   So, Alison, Jesse is here
       to support me...

08:18.232 --> 08:19.798
         ...Supervise.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.239
      ...Partner with you
       on the Snowball.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.273
         [phone rings]

08:28.308 --> 08:29.341
      I have to take this.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.510
    Carly will fill you in.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.812
    Let me know when you two
       lock down a venue.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.215
              Hi.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.263
  So, who's on the short list?
           Long list.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.764
      Comprehensive list.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.267
    That's just a fancy word
           for long.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.568
    Well, if we leave soon,

08:56.603 --> 08:57.769
   we can actually tour most
        of them today.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.272
 Actually, I think we can tour
  most of them this morning,

09:00.307 --> 09:01.339
           because...

09:03.110 --> 09:04.109
             <i> Yeah.</i>

09:04.144 --> 09:05.944
Just narrowed it down to three.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.746
             Carly!

09:07.781 --> 09:10.282
   You didn't tell me you're
  working with Jesse Mitchner.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.950
        Come, join me...

09:11.985 --> 09:14.486
   Aw, Brit, I would love to,
        but Jesse and...

09:14.521 --> 09:16.555
      Hey. How's it goin'?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.290
       What are you doing
       back here, Jesse?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.091
   I thought you were working
          up in Aspen.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.927
 Thought I'd help my sister out
        for a few days.

09:21.962 --> 09:22.661
              Ah.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.662
        Is your brother
         still around?

09:23.697 --> 09:24.663
    No, he moved to Boulder.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.731
   Construction was too slow
      in the off-season.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.934
         Shoot, Alison
       and Nate left too.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.136
  Yeah. Seasonal work is fine
      when you're single,

09:31.171 --> 09:34.506
 but once people have a family,
        it's kinda hard.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.575
         [phone rings]

09:36.610 --> 09:39.811
    Well, it's the plumbers.
           Excuse me.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.279
          <i> Jesse here.</i>

09:41.315 --> 09:42.948
  Everything good over there?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.482
        Didn't you hear?
    The banquet hall flooded

09:44.518 --> 09:46.418
     and the Snowball Gala
        is in 10 days,

09:46.453 --> 09:48.420
   and we're supposed to be
   sharing responsibilities.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.823
    Don't worry about Jesse.
   He's one of the good ones.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.061
             Yeah.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.172
    Hey, Ali. You have time
           to talk?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.440
        Yeah, of course.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.376
I just, I want to nail down some
 roles, some responsibilities.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.311
       Ooh, so corporate.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.447
We don't want to duplicate work,
 and it really seems like Carly

10:15.482 --> 10:17.349
      really has a handle
       on the Snowball.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.151
      Ah, Jesse, I missed
   your ability to delegate.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.820
      I'm not delegating.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.155
  I just, I want to make sure
   you play to my strengths.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.025
      And I would love to
   at any other time, but...

10:27.060 --> 10:30.528
   The Snowball's important.
   I need all hands on deck.

10:30.564 --> 10:33.231
       Hey, Ali, who let
     you out of the office?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.532
              Hi.

10:34.568 --> 10:35.667
           Jellybean!

10:35.702 --> 10:37.736
            [laughs]

10:37.771 --> 10:38.870
    What are you doing here?

10:38.905 --> 10:40.672
      You're like the CEO
         of Aspen now.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.340
    No, no, I'm just, uh...

10:42.376 --> 10:43.875
     Why didn't you tell me
     Jellybean was coming?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.477
      Well, I didn't know
      until this morning.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.746
    Also, I've gone by Jesse
     for the last 25 years.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.314
             Right.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.716
  Oh, uh, how about I call you
         JB for short?

10:51.752 --> 10:52.917
   Two rocky mountain cocoas?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.219
          Yes, please.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.721
     Jesse's actually here
        to help me out.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.157
   Ooh, so does that mean you
 might get a social life again?

10:59.192 --> 11:01.726
   There's a band playing at
  Snowshoe Sam's on Saturday,

11:01.762 --> 11:03.495
          just sayin'.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.663
        You'll make sure
       it happens, right?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.097
             Yeah.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.332
         On the house.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.034
            -Cheers.
            -Cheers.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.773
  Man, I was actually calling
    about that banquet hall

11:14.808 --> 11:16.341
       that you, uh, rent
       out for weddings.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.210
     Is it... it's closed?

11:19.246 --> 11:20.412
           All right.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.547
   Well, thanks anyways, man.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.382
      I guess we can cross
     that one off the list.

11:24.418 --> 11:27.118
 The Elks Club is closing soon.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.887
      Should we head over?

11:28.922 --> 11:31.389
        We could, but I
       just got an idea.

11:31.425 --> 11:34.159
   I think I know the perfect
  place we can throw the Gala.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.829
      Uh, what, what, um,
          excuse me?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.270
         A little help?

11:45.305 --> 11:48.206
           42 by 50.
         30 feet high.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.042
             Okay.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.777
 You have any other time-saving
          tips for me?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.245
             Mmhmm.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.947
 You can't hold the ball here.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.549
            Why not?

11:57.584 --> 11:59.451
    You'd exceed fire code.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.990
 Any reason you didn't tell me
that before I started measuring?

12:06.026 --> 12:09.427
Well, I feel like there are two
 types of people in the world.

12:09.463 --> 12:14.632
  Those who learn by hearing,
 and those who learn by doing.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.469
         And you think
      I'm the second kind.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.604
             Hmm...

12:19.639 --> 12:21.973
    You know, I think there
    are two types of people
      in this world, too.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.808
        [condescending]
              Oh.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.010
         Okay. Do tell.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.747
         There's those
      who are open minded,

12:28.782 --> 12:32.117
      and those who think
     they know everything.

12:38.692 --> 12:41.259
  You know, as much as I want
    high-end tourists here,

12:41.294 --> 12:43.094
     I also kind of don't.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.829
         What happened?

12:44.865 --> 12:47.132
  So this guy checks into the
 Matterhorn villa this morning

12:47.167 --> 12:48.967
   from somewhere in Europe.
     A Gustave something?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.468
    Ah, this poor concierge,

12:50.504 --> 12:52.103
       he really put her
      through the ringer.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.772
I mean, look at these requests.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.874
    Swiss chocolate powder,
      buckwheat pillows?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.175
           Buckwheat?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.777
             Right?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.746
           Good news.

13:01.782 --> 13:05.316
    Chair 3 is back online,
 and I think I owe you a drink.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.219
  I would love to, but I need
 to go over to the Matterhorn.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.790
 Uh, you should go with Jesse,
        I'll handle it.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.626
       Um, are you sure?

13:14.661 --> 13:15.994
            Uh-huh.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.530
          Okay, sure.
        He's all yours.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.731
            [laughs]

13:19.766 --> 13:21.032
             Great.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.233
         Bye, have fun.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.334
          -Thank you.
         -Cool. Thanks.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.803
             Yeah.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.505
      Why is Gus he here?

13:29.676 --> 13:35.513
 [engine rumbles and shuts off]

13:36.416 --> 13:39.017
       [knocking at door]

13:39.052 --> 13:42.187
              Yes?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.755
           Carlotta.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.356
     What are you wearing?

13:45.392 --> 13:48.059
    Is this company issued?

13:48.094 --> 13:50.662
      Any chance we could
       take this inside?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.030
        Of course, yes.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.065
        Come in. Please.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.870
  I didn't realize you were...

13:58.905 --> 14:00.738
      Is this what they've
         had you doing?

14:00.774 --> 14:03.074
     I solve problems, Gus,
        and I enjoy it.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.375
          [whispers]
     Speaking of problems,

14:04.411 --> 14:06.377
    what are you doing here?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.247
    "What am I doing here,"
           she asks.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.382
     We're twins, Carlotta.

14:11.418 --> 14:15.053
     We naturally gravitate
      towards each other.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.554
            [sighs]

14:16.590 --> 14:18.857
   Father's secretary gave me
          the address,

14:18.892 --> 14:21.259
    I thought I'd check in.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.927
      Nothing's happened,
            has it?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.963
    You mean, aside from you
     missing our birthday?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.865
       Gus, I called and
       I left messages.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.066
              Hmm.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.068
  Don't tell me you flew all
 the way here because of that.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.904
    No, but, in all honesty,

14:32.939 --> 14:36.140
 there are moments when I feel
     you've forgotten us.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.376
       The importance of
        your true job,

14:38.411 --> 14:40.278
  the job you were born into,

14:40.313 --> 14:44.716
    the job that every girl
  in the world only dreams of.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.719
      Princess of Landora.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.656
      Carly, I don't think
      you truly understand

14:51.691 --> 14:53.491
  how needed you are at home.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.294
      You are the only one
       with Father's ear.

14:56.329 --> 15:02.133
 Trust me, I'm very aware of my
role as the royal family buffer.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.469
 Part of why I took this year
off was that so you and father,

15:04.504 --> 15:06.704
  you could learn how to talk
        to each other.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.939
     Well, it didn't work.

15:07.974 --> 15:12.143
 Truthfully, when I found out
 you were staying away longer,

15:12.178 --> 15:13.711
          I panicked.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.580
        I only asked for
        a few more days,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.615
        just so I could
       run the Snowball,

15:17.651 --> 15:19.951
which I'm really excited about.

15:19.986 --> 15:23.388
    <i> Did someone say "Ball?"</i>

15:23.423 --> 15:24.656
         Prince Emile.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.759
 Uh, I thought that you were in
 Denmark with the royal family.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.460
    Have you been to Denmark
           in winter?

15:29.496 --> 15:31.095
              Ha!

15:31.131 --> 15:32.730
 I couldn't pass up the chance.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.332
  It's good to see you again.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.501
         So, this Gala.
      White tie, or black?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.902
              Ooh-

15:37.938 --> 15:39.304
         Good question.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.072
  No, see, that is the thing.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.840
  Formal around here, it means
        your good boots.

15:42.876 --> 15:46.244
 But it's hosted by a princess.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.346
    Surely that takes things
          up a notch.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.914
     See, that's the thing.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.416
       Nobody knows that
        I'm a princess.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.583
             What?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.085
            Really?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.653
And I plan to keep it that way.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.021
    Throwing the Snowball's
          hard enough

15:57.057 --> 15:58.323
   without people curtseying
            to you,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.091
 and asking to see your tiara.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.859
     But you're my sister.

16:01.895 --> 16:03.661
       Once I tell people
          who I am...

16:03.697 --> 16:05.296
              Yes.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.765
    But what if you didn't?

16:14.607 --> 16:15.940
      I don't know, Carly.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.176
  Pretending to be a commoner.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.944
 It's not exactly in the book.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.780
  Look, can't we just misplace
    the book for a few days?

16:22.816 --> 16:25.249
At least until the Snowden Fest
            events.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.852
     Events? As in plural.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.921
    Well, if you can't stay
      until the Snowball,

16:29.956 --> 16:32.457
 there's an ice rink, oh, and
there's a sleigh ride tomorrow.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.258
     Hm. I don't know, Gus.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.194
         Could be fun.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.130
  Hmm, well, I wasn't planning
     on staying that long,

16:39.165 --> 16:41.399
      and as far as events
        are concerned...

16:41.434 --> 16:43.034
         Oh, loosen up.

16:43.069 --> 16:47.605
We're not just going to events,
   we're going as commoners.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.374
    Fine, we'll consider it.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.609
    You can start by losing
        the royal "we."

16:51.644 --> 16:53.978
  All right. I'll consider it.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.546
       And the motorcade.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.782
  They did almost run someone
      over this morning.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.852
  Hmm. I suppose we don't need
     them with my car here.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.589
          -All right.
          -All right.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.790
       -See you tomorrow.
       -See you tomorrow.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.792
            Be safe.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.461
 It is good to see you, Carly.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.435
That's it, double black diamond,
             okay?

17:18.471 --> 17:19.503
           Excellent.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.570
           -Have fun.
           -All right.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.174
              Bye.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.742
         New arrivals?

17:24.778 --> 17:26.243
      You could say that.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.845
    And you're sending them
       to Devil's Peak?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.414
    Are you trying to create
       more work for me?

17:29.449 --> 17:30.615
          Don't worry.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.983
It's my brother and his friend.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.484
      They're good skiers.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.353
   Your twin brother is here.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.257
    He wanted to surprise me
       for our birthday.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.125
     Looks like it worked.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.660
 So, why don't you look happy?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.328
  I'm just a bit overwhelmed.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.798
 I still haven't found a venue
       for the Snowball.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.600
 At least Jesse's here, right?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.203
             Right.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.272
   This was his folks' place,
             right?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.773
   Why doesn't he work here?

17:55.809 --> 17:57.608
 He got his first job at Aspen.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.177
 I guess he moved up the ranks?

17:59.212 --> 18:00.812
      Well, doesn't Alison
         need his help?

18:00.847 --> 18:03.848
 I guess some people just need
  to strike out on their own.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.551
          Hmm. Right.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.352
   I understand that feeling.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.288
            [laughs]

18:25.605 --> 18:27.538
     Sorry, I didn't bring
       my A game today.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.173
        No, you did not.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.210
   But I would have settled
   for your B, C, or D game.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.045
    Something on your mind?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.813
            [sighs]
            Maybe.

18:35.849 --> 18:38.249
 Does Carly get off work soon?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.717
         I'm not sure.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.386
   I think she's off looking
   at a venue for the gala.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.155
              Why?

18:44.190 --> 18:45.656
           No reason.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.058
             Emile.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.026
    Has your childhood crush
     on my sister returned?

18:49.062 --> 18:50.495
          What crush?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.296
       We're old friends.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.169
      Who are you texting?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.904
      Father's secretary.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.339
       Until this moment,

19:01.374 --> 19:04.041
    I have been on the fence
   about the Snowball, but...

19:04.077 --> 19:07.111
   Now I'm thinking we should
        extend our stay.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.713
     Why would we do that?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.515
         Oh, no reason.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.884
 I think it's good that the two
    of you rekindle your...

19:12.919 --> 19:15.586
  friendship, as you call it.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.856
  And if it gives her another
  reason to return to Landora,

19:18.892 --> 19:22.026
           so be it.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.862
      Now, try and keep up
           this time.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.605
    Hey, the freight company
           left this.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.574
       Were you expecting
        any huge boxes?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.276
             No...

19:42.015 --> 19:44.382
    Carlotta? Is that Carly?

19:44.417 --> 19:45.583
              Oh.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.451
    That's weird. Says it's
         from Landora.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.920
I think she might be from there.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.621
         Or Luxembourg.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.056
          No, Landora.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.624
       I dunno, it's one
      of the L countries.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.127
    Just put it by her desk,
    she'll get it tomorrow.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.196
           All right.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.067
            Oh man.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.825
           Stay warm.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.762
     There you are, enjoy.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.998
     This is a great lineup
      for the sleigh ride.

20:34.033 --> 20:37.134
   Everybody loves it so far.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.203
      Hey, I'll take over
        the cider cart.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.372
   Go hang with your guests.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.773
        You're so sweet.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.875
   You should come meet them.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.377
           Jesse, hi.

20:46.412 --> 20:50.214
 Um, so this is my brother Gus,
     and our friend Emile.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.349
            Welcome.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.550
           Pleasure.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.051
 Must have been a long flight.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.686
     What, uh, what country
     are you from, exactly?

20:55.722 --> 20:58.856
       A small one no one
       has ever heard of.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.224
            [laughs]

21:00.260 --> 21:02.026
     Jesse here is working
    on the Snowball with me.

21:02.061 --> 21:02.660
              Yes.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.661
             <i> -Oh. </i>
             <i> -Ah.</i>

21:03.696 --> 21:05.196
         Good for you.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.664
   Oh, and Carly, you've yet
          to confirm,

21:06.699 --> 21:08.232
   is it white or black tie?

21:08.268 --> 21:09.467
           White tie?

21:09.502 --> 21:10.568
    They don't do that here.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.003
              No.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.337
  It's like a European thing.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.805
            [laughs]

21:14.841 --> 21:17.475
     Where is that sleigh?

21:17.510 --> 21:20.978
   So, how long have you been
      working with Carly?

21:21.014 --> 21:23.314
      Long enough to know
    that she will be missed.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.983
     Yes, she's been missed
        at home as well.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.986
      She's a big part of
      our family business.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.321
             Mmhmm.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.322
  What is it you do, exactly?

21:31.357 --> 21:34.225
   -Historical preservation.
       -Government work.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.894
    We do like a little bit
           of both.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.996
              Yes.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.164
          The sleigh!

21:41.401 --> 21:41.932
             Nice.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.435
     [laughs uncomfortably]

21:44.470 --> 21:45.169
           Have fun.

21:45.204 --> 21:45.770
            <i> Thanks.</i>

21:45.805 --> 21:46.437
       <i> Nice to meet you.</i>

21:46.472 --> 21:47.104
            You too.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.039
           <i> This way.</i>

21:48.074 --> 21:49.573
           <i> Follow me.</i>

21:58.217 --> 21:59.950
   <i> If you are missing home,</i>

21:59.986 --> 22:02.119
      I brought something
        to remind you.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.056
            You did?

22:05.091 --> 22:06.357
         What is this?

22:06.392 --> 22:09.860
   Some alpine hot chocolate
         I whipped up.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.930
   Ah, it reminds me of early
      mornings in Geneva.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.799
     Ah, yes. The academy.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.900
             Mmhmm.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.601
 Was it only two years we were
      at school together?

22:17.637 --> 22:20.404
       Hmm, I believe so.

22:20.440 --> 22:24.742
     And then off you went
    to a school in America.

22:24.777 --> 22:28.379
      Who knows, maybe if
    we'd overlapped longer,

22:28.414 --> 22:31.148
       things might have
       gone differently.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.117
           Who knows?

22:46.199 --> 22:49.500
        Carly! Hold up.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.301
              Hi.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.902
              Hey.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.272
        You're up early.

22:55.308 --> 22:56.640
    Uh, there's an issue up
       at the ski school

22:56.676 --> 22:58.509
 Alison wants me to check out.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.745
              You?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.813
     Oh, I needed a minute.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.415
     And then I ruined it.

23:04.450 --> 23:07.985
   No. Don't worry, I'll let
        this one slide.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.254
   How'd it go with your, uh,
    your guests last night?

23:10.289 --> 23:13.190
        Emile was having
          so much fun.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.260
      It's harder to tell
       with my brother.

23:16.295 --> 23:19.430
     I think he is scared
    that I won't come home.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.865
         Should he be?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.133
       No, of course not.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.601
       I have to go back.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.969
        Family business?

23:25.004 --> 23:27.338
        Family, period.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.939
   Well, he shouldn't worry.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.175
 In a few days, you'll be back
     on a plane to Landora

23:31.210 --> 23:34.145
   Wait?  What? I wouldn't...

23:34.180 --> 23:37.882
         Who told you
       I'm from Landora?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.884
   It must've been on my mind
    because of that package.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.152
    Oh, okay. What package?

23:41.187 --> 23:42.353
    The one under your desk.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.355
      I haven't been back
        to my desk yet.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.990
        It was delivered
        late last night.

23:46.025 --> 23:49.126
  Return address said Landora.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.628
    You're lucky you got it.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.830
They put these strange initials
    in front of your name.

23:52.865 --> 23:58.202
       "H.R.H Carlotta,"
         no last name.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.871
      So, I looked it up.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.240
 And I found a picture of you,
            Carly.

24:03.276 --> 24:07.978
      Her Royal Highness,
      Princess of Landora.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.855
   Who else knows about this?

24:17.890 --> 24:18.923
            No one.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.125
    Then you understand why
   I want to avoid that word.

24:21.160 --> 24:21.826
           Princess?

24:21.861 --> 24:22.626
             Shh!!!

24:22.662 --> 24:23.427
       It's just a word.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.462
     With so much baggage.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.497
  Princess, it means spoiled,
       entitled, a diva.

24:26.532 --> 24:27.665
 Does that mean your brother's
           a prince?

24:27.700 --> 24:28.499
            [sighs]

24:28.534 --> 24:30.100
         Crown Prince,
      heir to the throne.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.303
Why did you have to find that...
          that trunk?

24:32.338 --> 24:33.437
          Don't worry.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.306
   Okay, look, I don't think
   you're spoiled, or a diva.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.474
            [sighs]

24:36.509 --> 24:37.441
        That is so nice.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.977
     But having spent quite
      a few years as a...

24:41.881 --> 24:42.813
           [whispers]
           princess,

24:42.849 --> 24:44.281
 I have to tell you, that word,

24:44.317 --> 24:46.350
 it changes things, and I don't
       want it detracting

24:46.385 --> 24:47.351
       from the Snowball.

24:47.386 --> 24:51.222
  So please, can we just keep
       this between us?

24:51.257 --> 24:53.023
       <i> Carly, darling...</i>

24:55.261 --> 24:56.393
             Emile.

24:56.429 --> 24:59.129
      Just the woman I was
          looking for.

24:59.165 --> 24:59.930
        [laughs weakly]

24:59.966 --> 25:01.799
         Look at you,
      hitting the trails.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.567
        It'd be more fun
       with a tour guide.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.202
      I would love to hang
         with you both,

25:05.238 --> 25:06.737
     but with the Snowball
         coming up...

25:06.772 --> 25:09.173
    Perhaps Saturday, then.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.642
 Yes, I... I... I think I could
        make that work.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.310
        Uh, would Gus be
          joining us?

25:13.346 --> 25:16.247
  I think he can stand to sit
         this one out.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.414
           All right?

25:17.450 --> 25:18.649
         [engine roars]

25:18.684 --> 25:19.984
              Bye!

25:23.890 --> 25:27.024
       Don't tell me he's
         a prince, too?

25:27.059 --> 25:28.826
             Yeah.

25:32.431 --> 25:33.531
       I don't know, Dee.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.332
   It almost looks too pretty
            to eat.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.034
      I never met a cookie
        I couldn't eat.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.102
            [laughs]

25:38.137 --> 25:39.169
       How about you, JB?

25:39.205 --> 25:40.771
         Oh, I'm good.
          Thank you.

25:40.806 --> 25:42.540
           Wait. JB?

25:42.575 --> 25:45.175
     Dee used to babysit me
        back in the day,

25:45.211 --> 25:46.944
  and she's got a whole bunch
      of nicknames for me

25:46.979 --> 25:49.613
 that we don't need to mention,
 or go into greater detail on.

25:49.649 --> 25:50.681
             Okay.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.615
            [gasps]

25:51.651 --> 25:52.917
       Ooh, you should try
      the cinnamon rolls.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.351
   Actually, the pecan rolls.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.352
            So good.

25:55.388 --> 25:57.888
    You know I am from here,
    I... I do know the menu.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.424
  In fact, I might even know a
secret item that you don't know.

26:00.459 --> 26:01.425
          Hmm. Really?

26:01.460 --> 26:03.294
     Dee, where do you keep
    that handmade ice cream?

26:03.329 --> 26:04.128
           Ice cream?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.896
      I haven't made that
        in a long time.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.031
    Not even in the summer?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.299
 We close down for the summer.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.135
    So do three-quarter of
    the businesses up here.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.469
         That's right.

26:12.505 --> 26:15.372
       It's been that way
        for a long time.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.507
     You know, it's weird.

26:16.542 --> 26:20.110
 Things change, but in my head,
     Snowden Peak is still

26:20.146 --> 26:21.812
    the same as it was when
      I left for college.

26:21.847 --> 26:24.682
  Well, that just goes to show
   you need to visit us more.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.054
       Well, that's news.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.589
      What? No ice cream?

26:31.624 --> 26:32.690
              No.

26:32.725 --> 26:35.659
  How bad business has gotten
    here during the summer.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.629
   You mean it wasn't always
        this seasonal?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.831
  When I was growing up, this
  place was open year round.

26:40.866 --> 26:41.899
              Huh.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.100
It's magical during the summer.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.068
        Fishing, hiking.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.803
  This would be a much better
         place to live

26:45.838 --> 26:47.504
 if there was year-round work.

26:47.540 --> 26:51.642
     People could actually
        put down roots.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.945
       Are you memorizing
        the chairlifts?

26:54.981 --> 26:55.746
       The Summit Lodge?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.615
    Yeah, have you ever been
           up there?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.483
        It's been closed
       since I was a kid.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.318
   I think they store the ski
   school equipment up there

27:01.354 --> 27:03.087
         in the summer.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.055
      But it isn't summer.

27:09.195 --> 27:13.831
 Well, you have an interesting
      taste in buildings.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.599
            Come on.

27:22.575 --> 27:26.377
   Great views, and more than
     enough square footage.

27:26.412 --> 27:30.314
       Just imagine this:
       we dress the room.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.182
     It's already on resort
          property...

27:32.218 --> 27:34.952
      Guests, they arrive
     with their champagne.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.122
      Which means we don't
    have to pay a venue fee.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.890
             Jesse.

27:39.925 --> 27:43.060
      I am trying to paint
        a picture here.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.062
      I'm trying to paint
        a picture, too.

27:45.097 --> 27:49.233
 Mine's just a little bit more
   of a spreadsheet picture.

27:49.268 --> 27:54.872
  This is a great find, Carly,
   and it's given me an idea.

27:55.608 --> 27:56.874
       The Summit Lodge.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.142
             Mmhmm.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.810
        The AC works and
       the heating works.

27:59.845 --> 28:00.744
        Yeah, it should.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.880
      Mom and Dad built it
      to be a restaurant.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.548
        It was only open
        for a heartbeat.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.885
 Yeah, I mean, skiers loved it,
  but it's too hard to access,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.853
     so they repurposed it
          to storage.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.555
But, back then, we hadn't built
        the parking lot

28:11.590 --> 28:13.490
       next to Gondola 3.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.759
     Which now makes it...

28:15.795 --> 28:18.162
         ...accessible.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.496
  And there's one more thing.

28:19.532 --> 28:20.597
       A venue like this,

28:20.633 --> 28:22.199
it could really start to change
      things around here.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.267
         Change things?

28:23.302 --> 28:26.036
  People need year-round work.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.838
      Well, the ballroom
      is open year round.

28:27.873 --> 28:28.972
        No one books it.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.742
True, but think about why people
     come to Snowden Peak.

28:31.777 --> 28:35.079
 To be surrounded in mountains,
  outside, y'know, the forest.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.147
   Not stuck in a windowless
           ballroom.

28:40.986 --> 28:41.919
             Okay.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.354
     Say the summit lodge
    is all of these things.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.190
     No one knows about it.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.025
        And we have no
       publicity budget.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.729
    But, what if we treated
    the Snowball like an ad.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.397
        We could expand
        the guest list.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.932
    Add some event planners
         from Denver.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.400
        Some CEO types.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.701
        Oh, what about
     that wedding planner?

28:57.737 --> 29:00.704
   The one with the TV show,
       Preston Bentley?

29:00.740 --> 29:02.406
   Whose email I might happen
            to have.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.607
            You do?

29:03.642 --> 29:05.776
   We have our fair share of
 VIP guests at The Aspen Grand.

29:05.811 --> 29:06.777
              Hmm.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.413
 Well, if those types of people
         are coming...

29:09.448 --> 29:10.814
 this has gotta be a different
        kind of party.

29:10.850 --> 29:11.782
             Mmhmm.

29:11.817 --> 29:12.716
     We gotta up the ante.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.485
  You know, rethink the menu,
        get more help.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.286
  But, it would still only be
    a fraction of the cost

29:16.322 --> 29:18.956
       of an ad campaign.

29:18.991 --> 29:19.990
           All right.

29:20.025 --> 29:22.059
           All right?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.727
        You wanna do it?

29:25.197 --> 29:27.164
   I want theme, mood board,

29:27.199 --> 29:29.900
   and a revamped guest list
           tomorrow.

29:29.935 --> 29:30.434
           All right?

29:30.469 --> 29:30.834
             Mmhmm.

29:30.870 --> 29:31.668
          You got it.

29:31.704 --> 29:32.736
             Yeah.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.605
          Great work!

29:37.042 --> 29:38.475
        That went well.

29:38.511 --> 29:39.610
        Are you kidding?

29:39.645 --> 29:40.444
       You were amazing.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.713
       Well, you weren't
       so bad yourself.

29:44.850 --> 29:47.317
  You know, I never want to be
          a commoner,

29:47.353 --> 29:51.021
   but taking a few days off
       from being royal,

29:51.056 --> 29:52.656
  I haven't felt this relaxed
           in years.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.825
    Are you relaxed because
      you're a commoner,

29:54.860 --> 29:56.994
     or because you're away
       from your father?

29:57.029 --> 29:59.696
 Hmm, perhaps a little of both.

29:59.732 --> 30:01.165
      I'm beginning to see
       why Carly's gotten

30:01.200 --> 30:02.800
   so attached to this place.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.067
           Who knows.

30:04.103 --> 30:07.137
 Her old life might become more
 alluring in the next few days.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.338
              Oh?

30:08.374 --> 30:09.339
    We have a date Saturday.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.440
            A date.

30:10.476 --> 30:11.842
             Where?

30:11.877 --> 30:13.710
         Not sure yet.

30:13.746 --> 30:14.978
     But I'll let you know.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.180
             Maybe.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.214
       [laughs haughtily]

30:17.249 --> 30:18.916
             Emile.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.354
        You must be Gus.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.023
       I'm Brittany, your
       sister's roommate?

30:26.058 --> 30:27.558
         Oh, pleasure.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.393
 I just wanted to give you guys
          a heads up.

30:29.428 --> 30:32.296
     Happy Hour starts down
     at The Yodeller soon.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.331
          [confused]
          Happy hour?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.300
  Half price drinks and apps?

30:36.335 --> 30:37.534
           Ah, right.

30:37.570 --> 30:39.403
     Sounds... economical.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.671
      Will Carly be there?

30:40.706 --> 30:42.639
No, she's been working nonstop.

30:42.675 --> 30:43.874
     But it's all starting
          to pay off.

30:43.909 --> 30:44.842
             It is?

30:44.877 --> 30:46.210
  Rumour has it, she's trying
         to find a way

30:46.245 --> 30:48.145
    to bring year-round work
          to the town.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.714
         Oh, well, I...
         I had no idea.

30:50.749 --> 30:51.381
             Yeah.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.016
  You should be proud of her.

30:53.052 --> 30:53.984
            See ya.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.219
              Bye.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.022
              Hmm.

31:02.928 --> 31:04.528
    <i> (Carly) It snowed a lot</i>
          <i> last night.</i>

31:04.563 --> 31:06.430
         <i> (Jesse) Yeah.</i>

31:06.465 --> 31:08.332
   Are you sure that this is
    the only way we can get

31:08.367 --> 31:09.333
      the tables up there?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.335
     Yeah, they're too big
     to fit in the gondola.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.770
    Would you stop with all
     the obvious answers?

31:13.806 --> 31:16.807
    Well, if you stop asking
   all the obvious questions.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.379
      This road, it hasn't
     been plowed in months.

31:22.414 --> 31:26.350
       Yeah, which is why
      I wanted to go solo.

31:30.556 --> 31:34.258
        [tires spinning]

31:35.628 --> 31:37.394
             Okay.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.062
But then who would dig you out?

31:39.732 --> 31:40.564
             Yeah.

31:40.599 --> 31:41.899
             Yeah.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.009
            Careful.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.210
              Oh.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.245
  [out of breath] Do you think
  that there is cell reception

31:55.281 --> 31:56.947
       up on that ridge?

31:56.982 --> 31:58.782
          I doubt it.

31:58.817 --> 31:59.950
       Just keep diggin'.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.452
       It'll distract you
        from being cold.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.155
    I'm gonna need a better
    distraction than that.

32:05.190 --> 32:08.625
     Well, you could always
          talk to me.

32:08.661 --> 32:13.096
     I mean, fill me in on
   the whole princess thing.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.464
             Okay.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.033
   Well, we live in a castle.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.101
   Gus is four minutes older
           than me,

32:18.137 --> 32:19.870
     and someday he's gonna
            be king.

32:19.905 --> 32:22.272
   I was wondering about you.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.206
             Uh...

32:23.242 --> 32:27.778
       I mean, what does
     a princess do all day?

32:27.813 --> 32:34.785
    Uh, well, between public
appearances and ribbon cuttings,

32:34.820 --> 32:38.722
   I uh, keep the peace with
   my brother and the king.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.490
     They don't get along?

32:40.526 --> 32:43.360
  Well, they could talk more.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.662
   See, my brother, he wants
        to become king,

32:45.698 --> 32:48.365
 and my father wants to retire.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.034
  Sounds like there's a pretty
     simple solution there.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.271
     Nothing is ever simple
    when it comes to family.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.474
            [sighs]

32:57.509 --> 33:00.243
    So then what brought you
           out here?

33:00.279 --> 33:01.878
    Well, I wanted to prove
           to myself

33:01.914 --> 33:04.247
   that I could do something
          on my own.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.583
     I can't really do that
         back at home.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.185
      I know the feeling.

33:10.189 --> 33:14.224
You don't like being back here?

33:14.259 --> 33:18.829
 Well, my sister took over the
 reins when my parents passed.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.897
     Uh, I was in college.

33:20.933 --> 33:23.266
 And then I built myself a life
           in Aspen,

33:23.302 --> 33:25.469
    and I just never really
         looked back.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.172
            And now?

33:29.208 --> 33:32.042
 Um, well, it's like you said.

33:32.077 --> 33:35.245
     Nothing is ever simple
    when it comes to family.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.685
      <i> [knocking at door]</i>

33:41.720 --> 33:42.919
            Denmark!

33:42.955 --> 33:44.254
            [laughs]

33:44.289 --> 33:45.122
            Father?

33:45.157 --> 33:47.624
       Gustav. I do hope
       I'm not intruding.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.226
    No, no, of... of course.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.361
        Please, come in.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.270
   Hey, I got the truck out.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.873
        Everything good?

34:02.908 --> 34:07.477
   Jesse, what if this is it?

34:07.513 --> 34:09.813
 You know, maybe we could save
   the existential questions

34:09.848 --> 34:11.148
    for someplace with heat?

34:11.183 --> 34:12.549
              No.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.717
      What if this is it?

34:14.753 --> 34:17.954
   What if this is our theme
       for the Snowball?

34:17.989 --> 34:19.623
      Uh, "Empty Forest?"

34:19.658 --> 34:20.556
       Well, if whatever
       you're pitching me

34:20.592 --> 34:22.793
     is nixing the harpist,
       then yeah, I'm in.

34:22.828 --> 34:26.228
 No, what if we brought Snowden
 Peak's natural beauty indoors?

34:26.264 --> 34:28.331
     We can flock branches,
           topiaries,

34:28.367 --> 34:30.067
        hang tea lights.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.333
 You know, I really plan better

34:31.370 --> 34:33.170
       when hypothermia
    isn't setting in, so...

34:33.205 --> 34:34.670
 maybe we could talk about this
     back in the office...

34:34.706 --> 34:36.440
       We can hang shears
        on the ceiling,

34:36.475 --> 34:38.942
    and then have a thousand
     sparkling tiny lights.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.344
   And then, look over here,
            Jesse.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.480
   Carly, careful over there,
         it looks icy.

34:43.514 --> 34:44.281
           [screams]

34:44.315 --> 34:45.649
             Woah!

34:50.355 --> 34:53.757
       I'm gonna go back
         to the truck.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.690
             Okay.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.259
   Those tables won't get up
         the mountains

34:56.295 --> 34:59.529
       themselves, right?

34:59.565 --> 35:00.430
              No.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.631
              No.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.167
   I hope this will suffice.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.335
         It'll have to.

35:05.370 --> 35:09.673
  I've sent my entourage away,
   and I feel better already.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.641
      Oh, funny you should
         mention that.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.677
          Quite funny.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.613
     You see, we also sent
       our detail away.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.148
    It seems Carlotta has...

35:18.183 --> 35:19.816
     Indeed, where is she?

35:21.553 --> 35:24.621
   Right, I was just getting
          into that.

35:24.656 --> 35:27.457
      You have texted her
     to tell her I'm here?

35:27.493 --> 35:29.226
          Haven't you?

35:29.261 --> 35:32.462
            Have we?

35:32.498 --> 35:36.366
   It might not be advisable,
     father, at this time.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.835
       Perhaps you should
          take a seat.

35:38.871 --> 35:40.170
             Right.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.146
          [chattering]

35:50.182 --> 35:51.648
            [sighs]

35:51.683 --> 35:53.817
       Do we really need
         the goggles?

35:53.852 --> 35:55.652
       Father, you asked
         to see Carly,

35:55.687 --> 35:59.389
     and I'm doing my best
        to oblige you.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.258
   The whole "hiding" thing.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.192
  Do you really want me to...

36:02.227 --> 36:04.828
  to show up and surprise her
         at the ball?

36:04.863 --> 36:06.363
     You know how she dotes
            on you.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.364
    The second she sees you,

36:07.399 --> 36:09.733
her attention will be taken away
         from the ball.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.501
   It means that much to her?

36:11.537 --> 36:13.336
 It seems to mean a great deal
      to the people here,

36:13.372 --> 36:15.572
     and they seem to mean
     a great deal to Carly,

36:15.607 --> 36:20.944
  so please wear the goggles.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.779
       All right. I will.

36:22.814 --> 36:23.747
           Thank you.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.881
         Under protest.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.349
           All right.

36:35.661 --> 36:36.760
              Oh.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.065
        [clears throat]

36:42.100 --> 36:45.468
 Actually, I think I will wait
        till the ball.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.736
             Good.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.206
 Carlotta's always been upbeat,

36:49.241 --> 36:51.808
        but I've never
      seen her like this.

36:51.843 --> 36:55.445
  Well, I wouldn't judge her
in one isolated moment, father.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.814
      She's working hard.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.784
      She's rarely silly.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.420
      I meant this happy.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.321
             Right.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.822
           Of course.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.123
              Yes.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.996
     And there you have it.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.732
       Winter wonderland.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.470
           I'm sold.

37:20.505 --> 37:21.404
            -Eh...
           -You are?

37:21.440 --> 37:22.739
         That was fast?

37:22.774 --> 37:24.407
     I can update the evite
         list tonight,

37:24.443 --> 37:27.010
      change the location,
     send the new ones out.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.912
 All that leaves is the budget.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.947
Love your input on this, Jesse.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.782
 It's kind of your wheelhouse,
            right?

37:32.818 --> 37:34.584
            Sure is.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.488
           Good job.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.297
    Double espresso, please.

37:47.332 --> 37:48.665
  You pulling an all-nighter?

37:48.700 --> 37:50.200
         Late-nighter.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.802
 This must be Snowball related.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.704
            [sighs]

37:54.740 --> 37:57.173
      I can't seem to make
      the numbers add up.

37:57.209 --> 37:59.042
   The event we want is going
       to cost four times

37:59.077 --> 38:00.610
      what we can afford.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.045
    And up at Summit Lodge.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.447
        Very ambitious.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.716
      Does everybody know?

38:06.752 --> 38:11.054
  The prospect of summer work
  is a big deal around here.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.524
    Well, I hope people know
       it's a long-shot.

38:14.559 --> 38:16.960
      I don't wanna raise
     people's expectations.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.396
     Raising expectations.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.332
       Another word for
      giving people hope?

38:22.367 --> 38:24.734
         Also known as
    getting their hopes up.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.503
            Listen.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.038
       Your sister's been
         running around

38:28.073 --> 38:29.639
   putting out fires up here.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.509
  The fact that you and Carly
       even have a plan,

38:32.544 --> 38:35.712
it makes us feel that someone's
      looking out for us.

38:35.747 --> 38:39.082
      People haven't felt
       that way since...

38:39.117 --> 38:40.950
 since your parents were here.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.623
     On the house, Jelly...

38:47.759 --> 38:49.626
             Jesse.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.230
          Thanks, Dee.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.541
 You're making better progress
        on these trees

39:04.576 --> 39:06.609
    than I am on the budget.

39:06.645 --> 39:07.677
            Thanks.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.379
     Maybe we could switch.

39:09.414 --> 39:12.615
    My hand is cramping up.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.451
     Not your waving hand.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.719
              Ah.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.787
   You think that you know me
            so well.

39:17.823 --> 39:21.424
  But this is my waving hand.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.860
     And this is my ribbon
         cutting hand.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.931
          Marvellous.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.934
  I'm glad I had my tux sent.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.936
             Emile.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.604
      How did you find me?

39:34.639 --> 39:36.639
   Uh, your friend Brittany.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.241
  Uh, she even drew me a map.

39:38.276 --> 39:39.409
            [laughs]

39:39.444 --> 39:41.544
             Right.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.747
       I'm actually here
      about later tonight.

39:43.782 --> 39:44.748
           Tonight...

39:44.783 --> 39:46.383
             Right.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.451
I was thinking of picking you up
            at 8:00.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.421
 Unless you didn't want to go.

39:52.491 --> 39:57.360
       Um... It's, um...

39:59.664 --> 40:00.964
          8:00 it is.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.298
           Excellent.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.500
       I'll see you then.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.235
         See you then.

40:14.346 --> 40:17.147
  Jesse... Emile and I, we...

40:17.182 --> 40:20.049
   No explanation necessary.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.400
    Hope those are cookies.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.069
      Where were my boots?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.404
         In my closet.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.907
    You left them in my car
     about six months ago.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.743
   The last time we went out.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.511
        Snowshoe Sam's.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.980
      Oh, is that tonight?

        No excuses, Ali.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.517
     I'm here to hold down
           the fort.

40:54.553 --> 40:57.921
          No way, hon.
     You're coming with us.

  Emile, how on earth did you
       find this place?

41:17.542 --> 41:18.942
       I do my research.

41:18.977 --> 41:22.212
       Well, you exceeded
        my expectations.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.481
   And I hope to continue to.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.049
          Continue to?

41:26.084 --> 41:27.951
        Back in Landora.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.553
  I was thinking maybe I could
    spend the winter there,

41:30.589 --> 41:31.788
if that's something you'd want.

41:31.823 --> 41:35.124
Emile, I think that there's been
  some sort of confusion here.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.226
           Is there?

41:36.261 --> 41:37.327
       We're both royal.

41:37.362 --> 41:38.361
          Yes, we are.

41:38.396 --> 41:39.395
   We understand each other.

41:39.431 --> 41:40.897
  I'm not so sure about that.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.407
 And you'll do a smash-up job.

41:51.443 --> 41:54.344
  But you have to go back to
 your real life in a few days.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.479

45:38.103 --> 45:39.702

45:56.955 --> 45:59.088

           a prince?

        considered that.

46:45.003 --> 46:46.335
    I'd walk home with her.

              Oh.

46:47.639 --> 46:49.705
 How did things go with Emile?

46:49.741 --> 46:51.774
        Well, his ego's
    a little bruised, but...

46:51.810 --> 46:53.309
  his Ferrari's still intact.

46:53.344 --> 46:54.777

            [laughs]

46:56.681 --> 46:59.182
    I think I caught a chill
      at the impound lot.

46:59.217 --> 47:04.153
    My fingers were so cold
       I couldn't type.

47:04.189 --> 47:05.454

       when I was a kid.

47:25.777 --> 47:27.476
       What did you draw?

47:27.512 --> 47:29.912
        I went through
       a dinosaur phase.

47:29.948 --> 47:32.181
    And then I went through
      an army guy phase.

47:32.217 --> 47:35.017
 And then it all came together,

47:35.053 --> 47:38.754
  uh, dinosaurs vs. army guys.

47:38.790 --> 47:43.759
  I keep forgetting this isn't
     just a resort for you.

47:43.795 --> 47:47.063
           It's home.

47:47.098 --> 47:50.533

       for a while, too.

47:50.568 --> 47:54.170
        Until this time.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.672

48:49.327 --> 48:52.461
       I'm not even sure
      what I'm doing here.

48:52.497 --> 48:57.566
  So, not the best first date?

48:57.602 --> 49:01.037
     Her idea to come here,
         be a commoner,

49:01.072 --> 49:03.539
    what do you think of it?

49:03.574 --> 49:07.643
    I think... wait, Emile?

49:07.679 --> 49:10.479
      You're not thinking
     of following her lead?

49:10.515 --> 49:14.317
 I don't know, there might be
something to taking a year off.

49:14.352 --> 49:17.119
      Why do you say that?

49:17.155 --> 49:20.423
      She seems... happy.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.825
  And if there's anything in
  this world worth following,

49:22.860 --> 49:24.560
           it's that.

49:32.036 --> 49:34.036
            [laughs]

49:36.441 --> 49:39.775
 I'd call you an ice princess,
             but,

49:39.811 --> 49:41.944
 uh, that might be a little bit
          on the nose.

49:41.980 --> 49:44.313
  I've warmed up quite a bit,
          haven't I?

49:44.349 --> 49:45.348
     You're getting there.

49:45.383 --> 49:46.349

49:46.384 --> 49:47.616
     I have some good news
    for you about the gala.

49:47.652 --> 49:48.451

49:48.486 --> 49:51.087
    Dee is donating desserts
          and coffee.

49:51.122 --> 49:53.022
           For free?

49:53.057 --> 49:54.523
 I told her that if we can get
           the lodge

49:54.559 --> 49:55.791

     that the Summit Lodge

50:10.141 --> 50:11.774

     right now, a rumour.

50:14.312 --> 50:15.511

50:19.484 --> 50:24.120
    but it'd be so great if
  something year-round opened.

50:24.155 --> 50:26.155
      I'll tell you what.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.623
        You help us out
       with the Snowball,

50:27.658 --> 50:29.792
  and any off-season bookings
            we get,

50:29.827 --> 50:31.227
      I'll call you first.

50:31.262 --> 50:32.495
    I think you got yourself
            a deal.

50:32.530 --> 50:33.462
            [laughs]

50:35.733 --> 50:38.300
  Looks like you got yourself
       some volunteers.

50:38.336 --> 50:41.670
     Well, you inspire me.

50:41.706 --> 50:44.206
    Well, this might inspire
         you even more.

50:44.242 --> 50:45.875
 I just talked to The Yodeller,

50:45.910 --> 50:48.744
    and they are doing food
           for free.

50:48.780 --> 50:51.480
 And now I just have to stop by
      Snowden Peak Wines,

50:51.516 --> 50:53.649
       and we're all set.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.684
     I have a good feeling.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.486
            So do I.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.056
 [announcer voice] Four seconds
       left on the clock,

51:00.091 --> 51:01.757
  Jesse Mitchner has the puck.

51:01.793 --> 51:04.827
   He shoots, and he scores!

51:04.862 --> 51:07.363
That's a pretty one-sided game.

51:07.398 --> 51:10.199
Well, there's another broomstick
           over there

51:10.234 --> 51:11.667
  if you wanna be demolished.

51:11.702 --> 51:12.768
         Oh, no thanks.

51:12.804 --> 51:14.737
     I, uh, I wasn't gifted
  with imaginary hockey skills

51:14.772 --> 51:16.872
         like you were.

51:16.908 --> 51:18.240
  I heard what you guys pulled
           off today,

51:18.276 --> 51:21.210
      with the donations
      and the volunteers.

51:21.245 --> 51:23.579
          Mom and Dad
      would've been proud.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.247
     Well, that wasn't me.

51:25.283 --> 51:27.283
     That was Snowden Peak.

51:27.318 --> 51:29.852
  The people love this place.

51:29.887 --> 51:31.353
       I love this place.

51:31.389 --> 51:32.588
        Enough to stay?

51:32.623 --> 51:34.523
 I mean, the thought's crossed
           my mind.

51:34.559 --> 51:37.693
 Well, I'm gonna need a little
        more than that.

51:40.331 --> 51:43.732
   You know, I used to wonder
    how mom and dad did it,

51:43.768 --> 51:45.634
        but now I know.

51:45.670 --> 51:47.736
           Together.

51:47.772 --> 51:50.272
       I mean, this isn't
    a one-person job, Jesse.

51:50.308 --> 51:54.210
     I'm, uh, I'm not sure
    what you want me to say.

51:54.245 --> 51:56.745
    Then don't say anything.

52:08.626 --> 52:09.658
              Hey.

52:09.694 --> 52:11.660
              Hey.

52:11.696 --> 52:12.761
            Thanks.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.263
        I got your text.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.132
      So, what's going on?

52:16.167 --> 52:22.905
 Um, Ali wants me to stay here
           for good.

52:23.941 --> 52:26.275
Well, that can't be a surprise.

52:27.211 --> 52:29.411
      Well, it kind of is.

52:29.447 --> 52:32.448
    I never knew she needed
           my help.

52:32.483 --> 52:37.153
     So, what are you going
             to do?

52:37.188 --> 52:40.456
You ever feel like family's the
one thing you can't say no to?

52:40.958 --> 52:43.559
   [together] You are asking
       the wrong person.

52:48.199 --> 52:50.132
     The fog is so intense.

52:50.168 --> 52:51.634
     Yes, it's unfortunate.

52:51.669 --> 52:52.902
   If it weren't for the fog,

52:52.937 --> 52:55.971
 we could see the Summit Lodge
where Carly's holding the ball.

52:56.007 --> 52:58.874
Emile insists she's done wonders
        to the interior.

52:58.910 --> 52:59.542
            Really?

52:59.577 --> 53:01.610
              Mm.

53:01.646 --> 53:05.147
     Why do you think Carly
           came here?

53:05.183 --> 53:07.616
       I think she wants
       to leave her mark,

53:07.652 --> 53:12.321
and it might be easier to do so
     away from the palace.

53:12.356 --> 53:15.724
You sound as if you're speaking
       from experience.

53:15.760 --> 53:16.959
            [sighs]

53:16.994 --> 53:22.364
 I must admit, at home, I often
  feel I could be doing more.

53:22.400 --> 53:25.000
       Are you asking for
      more responsibility?

53:25.036 --> 53:29.038
 I suppose I'm asking to spend
      more time with you.

53:29.073 --> 53:30.506
           Learning.

53:30.541 --> 53:32.641
      How to do your job.

53:34.579 --> 53:39.081
   Gus, when I was made king,
           I was 19.

53:39.116 --> 53:41.083
      I never had a youth.

53:41.118 --> 53:44.019
   I didn't want you to feel
      burdened as I was.

53:44.055 --> 53:47.256
   It would not be a burden,
            father.

53:47.291 --> 53:50.526
     It would be an honour.

53:52.964 --> 53:54.563
            [laughs]

53:54.599 --> 53:56.031
     Why are you laughing?

53:56.067 --> 53:57.700
 Well, it's funny how life is.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.202
    I came here to check in
         on one child,

54:00.238 --> 54:04.707
  and wound up seeing a whole
     new side of another.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.275
              Hmm.

54:06.310 --> 54:09.411
Well, I believe it's happy hour.

54:09.447 --> 54:10.746
          Happy hour?

54:10.781 --> 54:14.116
   Yes, half price on drinks
        and appetizers.

54:14.151 --> 54:16.185
        Ah. Happy hour.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.920
       Half price drinks.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.588
      Are you sure, Carly?

54:19.624 --> 54:22.191
   A promotion to lead event
       planner, a raise?

54:22.226 --> 54:23.125
  None of that appeals to you?

54:23.160 --> 54:27.029
   Alison, of course, I would
        love to say yes.

54:27.064 --> 54:29.598
         It's just I...

54:29.634 --> 54:31.567
            Family.

54:31.602 --> 54:32.635
        You understand.

54:32.670 --> 54:33.269
             Yeah-

54:33.304 --> 54:35.037
        Of course I do.

54:35.072 --> 54:37.306
        Oh, I just wish
        my brother did.

54:37.341 --> 54:38.607
            Well...

54:39.644 --> 54:42.244
             What?

54:42.280 --> 54:43.946
            Nothing.

54:45.650 --> 54:46.915
          [door slams]

54:50.588 --> 54:51.887
              Hi.

54:51.922 --> 54:53.289
             Hello.

54:53.324 --> 54:54.490
        Can I help you?

54:54.525 --> 54:57.092
    Yes, I just heard about
        this new space,

54:57.128 --> 54:59.461
 and I thought I'd check it out
          for myself.

54:59.497 --> 55:01.130
   Are you an event planner?

55:01.165 --> 55:03.499
     I throw several events
          a year, and,

55:03.534 --> 55:06.602
 uh, I suppose they're planned.

55:06.637 --> 55:10.172
Oh, can you believe this was an
empty space just a few days ago?

55:10.207 --> 55:11.807
        Entirely empty.

55:11.842 --> 55:13.142
          Incredible.

55:13.177 --> 55:15.944
   I wish I could take credit
            for it,

55:15.980 --> 55:17.646
      but it's mostly our
     event planner's work.

55:17.682 --> 55:19.181
  He or she must be very good.

55:19.216 --> 55:21.317
            She is.

55:21.352 --> 55:23.952
  Unfortunately, she's leaving
       us in a few days.

55:23.988 --> 55:25.788
              Ah.

55:25.823 --> 55:31.527
  Well, I suppose a new event
 planner will be easy to find.

55:31.562 --> 55:35.130
         Not like her.

55:35.166 --> 55:36.298
    You in town for a while?

55:36.334 --> 55:37.333
              Yes.

55:37.368 --> 55:39.268
  I'll leave a ticket for you
      at the front desk.

55:39.303 --> 55:40.836
        You should come
        to the Snowball.

55:40.871 --> 55:42.204
   See this place in action.

55:42.239 --> 55:43.305
         Oh, please do.

55:43.341 --> 55:45.040
    I'd like that very much.

55:45.076 --> 55:46.942
           Thank you.

55:46.977 --> 55:48.477
        You're welcome.

55:52.216 --> 55:54.483
 Great, well, let's talk soon.

55:58.189 --> 55:59.121
              Hi.

56:02.426 --> 56:03.292
              Hey.

56:03.327 --> 56:05.027
    Hey. You wanted to talk?

56:05.062 --> 56:06.795
 I thought about what you said,

56:06.831 --> 56:09.531
     and I want to let you
         know that...

56:09.567 --> 56:12.835
 the reason I didn't come back
         to work here.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.536
   It wasn't because of you.

56:14.572 --> 56:17.206
       It was because of
       something bigger.

56:17.241 --> 56:19.074
              Um.

56:19.110 --> 56:23.011
 But mom and dad, they... they
 built this place from nothing.

56:23.047 --> 56:27.683
 When I moved to Aspen I wasn't
 Barb and Doug Mitchner's kid.

56:27.718 --> 56:30.018
        I was anonymous.

56:30.054 --> 56:32.421
 But now I'm really starting to
 see the value in a small town,

56:32.456 --> 56:33.389
            and I...

56:33.424 --> 56:35.724
     I never begrudged you
     for moving to Aspen.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.493
       If anything, I was
       a little jealous.

56:37.528 --> 56:38.560
            [laughs]

56:38.596 --> 56:39.695
             Okay.

56:39.730 --> 56:40.929
          No regrets.

56:40.965 --> 56:43.399
Well, it was always part of my
plan to move back here someday.

56:43.434 --> 56:46.935
    Well, sometimes someday
   doesn't come soon enough.

56:46.971 --> 56:48.904
      I don't understand.

56:48.939 --> 56:50.672
   I was just showing around
       a potential buyer

56:50.708 --> 56:52.875
        and we're lucky.

56:52.910 --> 56:54.343
 Her offer came in really high,

56:54.378 --> 56:56.378
  especially with the promise
      of summer business.

56:56.414 --> 56:58.080
           An offer?

56:58.115 --> 57:01.583
 Are you selling Snowden Peak?

57:01.619 --> 57:04.586
  It is just so much to handle
           on my own.

57:04.622 --> 57:05.554
    Since you've been here,

57:05.589 --> 57:07.089
     I've been able to have
      a life again, and...

57:07.124 --> 57:08.991
      and that feels good.

57:35.753 --> 57:36.718
            Lovely.

57:42.827 --> 57:44.460
        [knocks gently]

57:46.597 --> 57:50.632
          Uh, I, uh...

57:50.668 --> 57:52.468
   Found this in the printer.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.974
  I'll tell you the same thing
       that I told Jesse.

57:59.009 --> 58:01.076
  Nothing is etched in stone.

58:01.111 --> 58:04.480
    Alison, you don't owe me
        any explanation.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.415
     Guys, I am not making
         any decisions

58:06.450 --> 58:08.016
   until after the Snowball.

58:08.052 --> 58:09.852
     I mean, you have done
       an incredible job

58:09.887 --> 58:11.920
   at putting this together.

58:15.226 --> 58:17.759
   But I do have to be honest
           with you.

58:17.795 --> 58:21.363
    We haven't gotten quite
 the response we've hoped for.

58:21.398 --> 58:24.433
     But everyone's going.

58:24.468 --> 58:26.668
 Well, everyone here is going.

58:26.704 --> 58:30.506
    But the people we added
       to the guest-list

58:30.541 --> 58:34.142
  who could make or break this
     year-round venue idea,

58:34.178 --> 58:37.713
  I just found out we haven't
       heard back from.

58:37.748 --> 58:41.216
    I mean, unless you have
  some sort of celebrity draw,

58:41.252 --> 58:44.953
   getting people all the way
   out here is a tough sell.

58:50.661 --> 58:53.328
 I couldn't help but overhear.

58:53.364 --> 58:55.497
       Are you all right?

58:55.533 --> 58:59.902
  I'm fine, I... I just, um...
        I need some air.

58:59.937 --> 59:00.736
       Carly, what did...

59:00.771 --> 59:03.639
 I... I know you want to help,
             Gus.

59:03.674 --> 59:05.340
     I just need a minute.

59:05.376 --> 59:06.775
           Of course.

59:11.682 --> 59:12.581
          Good night.

59:12.616 --> 59:14.483
          Good night.

59:27.531 --> 59:29.431
Carly, I've got your latte here.

59:29.466 --> 59:30.265
           I'll wait.

59:30.301 --> 59:32.868
         No, no, no, no
      right here, come on.

59:32.903 --> 59:36.271
      Oh, you're so sweet.

59:36.307 --> 59:41.410
       And, I baked these
         just for you.

59:41.445 --> 59:43.245
           Open them.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.147
       <i> A real princess.</i>

59:57.428 --> 59:59.227
         <i> -Carlotta!  </i>
         <i> -Carlotta!!</i>

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.434
              Gus.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.273
           Oh, Carly!

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.776
        <i> Wait!  Wait...</i>

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.946
      Where are we going?

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:20.816
              Ah.

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:22.618
     Are you angry with me?

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.319
       I am not thrilled.

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:28.190
But I'm also confident you have
      a good explanation.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:31.293
              Gus?

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:32.427
             Carly.

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:36.131
I've learned a lot of new things
    about you on this trip.

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.333
     How committed you are.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:41.837
       How much you care
       about this place.

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.105
     But you are my sister,

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.574
    and I also know how much
        pride you have.

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:47.809
     You would never reveal
       you are a princess

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:51.113
 just to have a better turnout
         at the ball.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.649
    So you leaked my secret
       to the newspaper?

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:55.117
            For me?

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.486
       Yes, with the best
         of intentions.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.626
           [exhales]

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.461
   Well, this is surprising.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:07.663
            I know.

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:09.464
   Apparently, I'm artistic.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.668
      I meant that you're
          even here.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:16.672
 I figured after last night...

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:18.473
            [sighs]

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:22.844
      I thought about it.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.313
  I feel like we can still get
   Alison to change her mind.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:26.948
            You do?

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:28.617
             Mmhmm.

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:32.287
             Wait.

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:33.822
       All these people?

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:34.923
          Volunteers.

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:37.859
Who signed up before anyone knew
      you were a princess.

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:39.227
             Carly.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:42.664
       This is about more
        than you or me.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:47.703
And these people really believe
in your vision for this place.

01:01:47.738 --> 01:01:51.740
  You know, the other day, you
  asked me why I stayed away.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:55.644
    Well, you never asked me
     what brought me back.

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:57.713
           It's this.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:01.383
    People working together,
   having each other's backs,

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:04.352
   making a good thing great.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.155
  That's Snowden Peak for you.

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:09.725
    I'm missing it already.

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:21.937
           [exhales]

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:23.905
      What, it's so heavy!

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.708
    Try wearing it during a
    five-hour state dinner.

01:02:26.744 --> 01:02:29.111
      How do you even hold
         your head up?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:30.879
      Strong neck muscles.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.114
             Mmhmm.

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:34.249
          <i> [knocking]</i>

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:35.717
           Enjoy it.

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.088
     Do you have a minute?

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:42.290
    I'm just about to head
   to the lodge to decorate.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.792
       Can we talk later?

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:47.129
       Well, actually no.

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:53.101
    Was she terribly upset?

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:54.536
              Yes.

01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:56.304
       But she did seem
    to cheer up quite a bit

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.473
    after shoving snow down
          my sweater.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:00.475
           [chuckles]

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.445
   It's just, I've seen how
important this place is to her.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.781
     I had to do something.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:10.385
It was probably the wrong thing
   to do though, wasn't it?

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.588
 You should have gone about it
        more honestly.

01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:17.225
 I also know it was a difficult
         call to make.

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:20.262
      But, it did make me
      realize something.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.164
          What's that?

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:25.667
       We need to spend
      more time together.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:27.169
       If you can't see
      the job being done,

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:30.472
     how are you ever going
           to do it?

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:31.807
          You mean?...

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:34.042
       When you are king.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:41.016
  I've learned a lot about you
         on this trip.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.953
   I never realized how ready
     you are for the crown.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:48.490
  A true king does what's best
        for his people.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:49.624
            [laughs]

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.359
      Forgive me, father.

01:03:51.395 --> 01:03:54.296
    I'm thrilled, of course.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.264
      This is unexpected.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:01.303
    Well, the best surprises
          always are.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.638
     Happy early birthday.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:10.278
       Cocoa makes every
      conversation better.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:13.281
         So, what's up?

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:16.885
     I'm going home to see
          the queen.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.453
    Oh, she'll be thrilled.

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:21.289
       Not when she hears
      what I'm asking for.

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:23.525
A year off from being a prince.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.996
    Well, huh, this is quite
            a turn.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:28.864
          Yes, it is.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:29.898
              Yes.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:31.533
           Thank you.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:35.704
      I have to tell you,
        I was jealous.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:37.639
     Oh, Emile, you deserve
       to meet someone...

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:40.208
     Not jealous of Jesse.

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:42.410
     I was jealous of you.

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:45.046
   You did such a brave thing
          coming here,

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:51.219
 I figured, why not take a page
     out of your playbook?

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.822
     So, what's your plan?

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:55.557
         Hmm, not sure.

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:57.559
      But wherever I go,
     I'll be flying coach,

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.095
  getting a job, and figuring
     things out on my own.

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.497
   Hmm. And leaving the car,
            right?

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:03.498
            [coughs]

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:04.733
     Now, don't get crazy.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:08.870
            [laughs]

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:12.007
   Thanks for helping me see.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:15.110
      We're all born into
            a role,

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:19.080
   but the person you become
         is up to you.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:20.048
            Cheers.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.650
            Cheers.

        [sighs heavily]

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:32.961
            [laughs]

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:35.597
     Please say that we're
         almost done.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.599
  Well, we've got a couple of
      finishing touches,

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.034
       and we have to get
      the sound system up,

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.635
    but we're almost there.

01:05:40.671 --> 01:05:44.940
Oh, um, I found the most amazing
   cafÃ© orchestra in Boulder.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.741
   I'll play you my setlist,
        listen to this.

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:49.411
      Well, I thought that
      we decided on a DJ.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.313
    No, we talked about it,

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.949
  and we circled back to doing
         an orchestra.

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:58.219
Okay, and what's this orchestra
     going to be playing?

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.922
      Waltzes, of course.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:03.825
 I'm starting to wish I hadn't
      vetoed the harpist.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.161
       Oh, come on Jesse.

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:09.297
    I bet you've never even
        waltzed before.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:11.933
              No.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.134
         Not a chance.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:17.439
 Well, I think you should make
  sure that the space works.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.274
         In that case.

             Ready?

01:06:26.883 --> 01:06:28.083
             Sure.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:29.250

            [laughs]

01:06:30.454 --> 01:06:31.653
       Counter clockwise.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.755
     You always have to go
      counter clockwise,

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:34.522
     or else you'll crash.

01:06:34.558 --> 01:06:35.623

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.225
             Okay.

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:42.464
      Why are you leading?

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.367

 Carly, oh, you'll never guess
     who just checked in.

 The CEO of the Bank of Denver.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.825
      And the US Ski Team
        event planner.

01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:13.294
 And Preston Bentley, that guy
who does all those TV weddings.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:16.331
     I mean, it's happened!

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:13.988
            Thanks.

01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:50.825
   You forget your party face
            at home?

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:53.728
           I'm fine.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:09:00.902
  It's just, I've known Carly
was a princess this whole time.

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:03.971
      She is no different
         to me, but...

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.140
            [sighs]

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:07.609
 I'm starting to realize, Ali.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.044
       She's a princess.

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:12.913
       What do you mean?

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.515
       This is her life.

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.886
 Everything here was just a...
          a vacation.

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:23.524
      This is her reality.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.193
            Ohhh...

01:09:25.228 --> 01:09:27.729
    I don't want to see you
           get hurt.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.999
    You don't have to worry
           about me.

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:39.640
               â™ª

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.943
        <i> Oh, very nice. </i>

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:56.491
           Thank you.

01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:01.062
  May I have the first dance?

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:12.140
               â™ª

01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:19.847
Carlotta, you're awfully quiet.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:22.050
    Have you nothing to say?

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:24.686
 Just that your gamble worked.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.956
    The people who we wanted
     to come actually came.

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:32.727
     So, you wanted to say?

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:33.695
           Thank you.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.330
              Hm.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:37.699
Well, I should be thanking you.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:40.101
    Seeing you go after what
        you wanted here

01:10:40.136 --> 01:10:42.437
  inspired me to do the same.

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:48.209
       I don't understand
        what that means,

01:10:48.245 --> 01:10:51.045
 but I suppose I will take it.

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.113
      Father and I talked.

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:53.114
             Mmhmm.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:55.617
     He's going to have me
    shadow him this spring.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:57.018
          Shadow him?

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.253
          You mean?...

01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:01.222
Well, if all goes well, I won't
 be crown prince much longer.

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:02.757
   So he agreed to step down.

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:04.559
     Well, not right away,
           mind you.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.262
    But within the next year
            or two.

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:09.063
  I am so happy for you, Gus.

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:11.399
       Yes, we have a lot
         to celebrate.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:16.204
         What is this?

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:17.605
       It's for the wish.

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:19.607
      You've never missed
            a year.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:20.642
        You remembered.

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:21.909
              Mm.

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:30.451
     This is one tradition
     I always want to keep.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.686
            Me too.

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.722
           [together]
       One, two, three...

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.627
        Happy Birthday.

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.465
              Mmm.

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:46.768
        What is it that
        you wished for?

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.836
      That your birthday
      is as good as mine.

01:11:48.872 --> 01:11:51.139
        Excuse me, Gus.

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:52.774
  I don't want to be forward,

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.509
      but this might also
       be my only chance

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.778
         to dance with
      a prince at a ball.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.113
          I'd love to.

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:11.159
            <i> [waltz]</i>
               <i> â™ª</i>

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:12.760
         There you are.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:14.495
 Where have you been all night?

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:18.833
      Just, uh, you know,
       taking things in.

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:23.771
  I'm sorry about all the fuss
           out there.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.373
   The whole princess thing.

01:12:25.408 --> 01:12:27.342
      That is who you are.

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:29.644
  You don't need to apologize
            for it.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:32.113
    It was important for me
           to see...

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:33.748
            [sighs]

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:35.983
     who you're, you know,
      you're born to be.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:39.454
    I don't want to be born
        into something.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.889
       I want to choose.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:49.697
   And I choose to stay here
   in Snowden Peak, with you.

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:52.967
  Don't you think I want that?

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:56.204
   The way I feel about you.

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:59.907
   Then, what's stopping you?

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:04.245
    Happiness comes in a lot
   of different forms, Carly.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.049
         Not just this.

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:13.921
     It comes from family,
      and from sacrifice,

01:13:13.957 --> 01:13:16.491
   and doing the right thing,

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:19.660
     and if I encourage you
     to leave your family,

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:22.563
    I don't think you could
       ever forgive me.

01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:23.164
          But Jesse...

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:25.400
           I'm sorry.

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:28.903
       I walked away from
        my family once.

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:31.706
   I can't be the reason that
   you walk away from yours.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.644
           Excuse me.

01:13:55.632 --> 01:13:57.732
           Father...

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:03.538
    You flew halfway across
 the world to come to my party?

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:05.373
       To see my daughter
        on her birthday,

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:08.075
  I'd fly just about anywhere.

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:11.779
            [laughs]

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:13.414
             Oh...

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:14.749
      Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.217
          No curtseys.

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:17.652
         I'm incognito.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:19.153
      This is your night.

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:22.223
 I can't tell you how glad I am
          to see you.

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:23.624
           [chuckles]

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.426
      Sorry to interrupt.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:26.794
       I had to tell you.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.831
I have had four booking requests
        for the summer.

01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:31.432
   Alison, that's wonderful.

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:34.469
    Well, I would be happy
  to reveal myself as royalty

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:36.838
        anytime you need
      to drum up business.

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:39.474
  Carly, people might show up
       for a spectacle,

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:42.143
 but they're not going to book
the space unless it's top notch.

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.111
   And that has nothing to do
        with your title.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:47.615
  but it has everything to do
  with what you guys did here.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.418
Well, it wouldn't have happened
   if it weren't for Jesse.

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:54.055
           Excuse me.

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:57.692
              So.

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:01.729
    When will I get to meet
      this Jesse fellow?

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.505
  Let's just enjoy the party.

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:22.984
  For a man who's just thrown
      a heck of a party,

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.986
  you don't look very upbeat.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.522
 I'm not having the best night.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:30.491
I sense this is romance related.

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:33.094
        You sense right.

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:35.663
      I don't envy people
           your age.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.932
    Finding the right person
          isn't easy.

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:41.836
 You know, what's even more of
 a struggle is finding someone

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.872
     who might be the one,

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:49.810
  and then having to walk away
           from them.

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:50.711
           I'm sorry.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:52.880
  I shouldn't be bothering you
           with this.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:57.051
   No, sometimes it's easier
    to talk to a stranger.

01:15:57.086 --> 01:16:00.688
So, what's making you walk away?

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:05.526
      She has some major
      family obligations.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:09.196
I didn't think it would be fair
  to pull her away from them.

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:12.733
 I think I'm going to head out.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:13.734
     Thanks for listening.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:15.069
            Anytime.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:20.174
      Oh, might I give you
          some advice?

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:23.344
    Stay at the party a few
         more minutes.

01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:24.745
              Why?

01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:28.082
      Well, if you leave,
      your fate is sealed.

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:32.553
   If you stay, your fortune
         could change.

            [waltz]
               â™ª

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:45.433
    Everyone is saying such
    nice things about you.

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:48.402
       Must be very hard
        to say goodbye.

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:50.771
       I promised I would
        come back home,

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:53.708
  and a promise is a promise.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.242
  Well, you made that promise

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:58.546
       before I saw what
       you've built here.

01:16:58.581 --> 01:16:59.547
   Well, last time I checked,

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:01.916
   you didn't raise me to be
       an event planner.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:02.750
             So...

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.219
     No, I raised you to be
          a princess.

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:08.289
   Which you will always be,
   no matter where you are.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:12.760
I saw that tonight, in what you
      did for this town.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:17.598
    Whatever part I played,
  it was the least I could do.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.934
        I am happy here.

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:28.709
      Then, be happy here.

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:33.748
           You mean?

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:36.684
           Stay here.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.419
             Stay?

01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:39.854
             Here?

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.622
        In Snowden Peak?

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:43.791
    Is that even an option?

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.826
   Well, I never presented it
         as one before,

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:48.629
      because I was afraid
         of losing you.

01:17:48.665 --> 01:17:52.967
   But after seeing all this,
   I'm not losing a princess.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.836
  Snowden Peak is gaining one.

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:58.939
You have my blessing, Carlotta.

01:17:58.975 --> 01:18:00.941
           Thank you.

01:18:02.478 --> 01:18:04.945
     Well, don't thank me.

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:08.349
   Thank the young man I met.

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:10.951
           Young man?

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.255
    Yes. A friend of yours.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.529
   I don't believe we've been
      formally introduced.

01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:24.665
  I'm Kristof, Carly's father.

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:26.567
 And I am extremely embarrassed

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:29.203
    that I was just pouring
     my heart out to you.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:33.374
    And what exactly did you
     pour out to my father?

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.543
     I'll let him tell you.

01:18:35.578 --> 01:18:37.778
        It's all yours.

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:44.585
 Let me just say that I should
   not have let some fabric

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:51.392
and metal and rocks change what
I know about who you really are.

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:53.194
           Thank you.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:56.363
Now, I'm not done hearing about
 how you poured your heart out

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.065
         to my father.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:01.035
    You have plenty of time
         to hear that.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.837
    Just give me one minute.

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.044
              So?

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.613
      What's the verdict?

01:19:12.648 --> 01:19:14.215
          Great party.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.216
    You know I had a thought

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:17.184
 about a guy who could help you
        run the resort.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.252
            [sighs]

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:19.620
     Hey, he's experienced.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:20.755
         He's devoted.

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:23.257
    Knows the resort through
          and through.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:27.595
   There is a little problem.

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.431
   He's a bit of a delegator.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.600
     Do not do this to me.

01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:33.934
           I want to.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.369
       Work that matters?

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:39.406
       Living up to what
      mom and dad started?

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:40.975
        You're serious?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.777
     You're 100 percent in?

01:19:42.812 --> 01:19:44.712
        I am if you are.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.982
  You know running this place
           is tough,

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:51.085
    even with the two of us.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.054
     What if it wasn't just
         the two of us?

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:02.096
         Oh, you guys.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:03.397
           Come here!

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:05.566
            [laughs]

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:18.712
            <i> [waltz]</i>
               <i> â™ª</i>

01:20:30.893 --> 01:20:32.426
       We'll meet you at
        the Yodeller...

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:33.994
             <i> Bye!</i>

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:41.602
      You know, last week
      I was counting down

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:44.605
     the days until I could
       go back to Aspen?

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.440
              And?

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:50.344
 Ah, somewhere between getting
       stuck in the snow

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:53.280
and planning the most difficult
     party ever planned...

01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:54.715
            [laughs]

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.483
      I stopped counting.

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:59.186
      The town got to you?

01:20:59.222 --> 01:21:02.156
       I think you might
      have got to me, too.

01:21:04.594 --> 01:21:10.164
What would you say if I told you
I've never met anybody like you?

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:14.034
    I'd say "say it again."

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:27.615
