00:02.203 --> 00:05.106
Bank Manager:
You wish to open an account?

00:05.106 --> 00:06.740
Yes, please, sir.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.009
It would be an honor.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.980
And what would you bring as...
collateral?

00:12.980 --> 00:15.249
It's the thing you want.

00:15.249 --> 00:18.419
The thing you want
best of all.

00:21.889 --> 00:25.593
You've brought me...

00:25.593 --> 00:27.395
The Vessel?

00:27.395 --> 00:29.029
( door opens )

00:32.600 --> 00:36.170
After all these years,

00:36.170 --> 00:39.039
I finally have
his precious...

00:45.146 --> 00:46.680
This is a forgery.

00:46.680 --> 00:52.720
You dare attempt to deceive
the Bank of Thieves?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.223
You two are toxic assets,

00:55.223 --> 00:58.492
and you know what
the Bank of Thieves does

00:58.492 --> 01:01.662
with toxic assets.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.963
It liquidates them.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.165
- Wait.
- No!

01:04.165 --> 01:07.368
Wait, I--
( grunting )

01:10.538 --> 01:13.541
( music playing )

01:21.014 --> 01:24.218
Let me be very clear.
No touching.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.986
- It can't be.
- I don't believe it.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.722
- It's Santa's sleigh!
- Yes, it is.

01:28.722 --> 01:32.826
And also, no touching.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.229
Chassis made
of exotic materials,

01:35.229 --> 01:38.466
runners forged
of reinforced steel.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.635
I wonder how fast this cat
can go when it gets on it.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.271
Mr. Stone,

01:43.271 --> 01:45.939
please, may I remind you
of the enormity

01:45.939 --> 01:47.475
of our responsibility here.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.610
This is the first time
Santa has ever left the sleigh

01:49.610 --> 01:52.045
in the care of anyone
except the elves.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.114
We have a duty of care.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.850
To guard it,
to protect it,

01:56.850 --> 01:58.152
and not to touch it.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.520
I think it's wonderful.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.889
The elves are finally
due a break.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.025
Yes, indeed.
So, as Santa was,
and we all are.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.128
Yeah, except for us,
'cause we'll on on sleigh duty
all Christmas.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.232
I'm sorry, Ezekiel.
Are we boring you?
You keep checking your watch.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.301
Yeah. It's a nice watch.
I like it, okay?

02:13.301 --> 02:15.569
- Sunglasses! Sunglasses!
Where are my sunglasses?
- They're on your head.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.439
- Ah. Sun hat? Sun hat? Su--
- Also on your head.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.808
I'm not crazy
about this whole vacation idea.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.478
What are you talking about?
To get asked to go on vacation
with Santa is an honor.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.447
I'm not in
a very relaxing mood.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.316
That is why you need
a vacation.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.617
That's like me saying
I'm not hungry

02:29.617 --> 02:31.385
and you saying
so have a big cake.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.488
All right, now, thank you.
Librarians, please remember,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.690
the sleigh must rest
and recuperate

02:36.690 --> 02:40.027
in order to recover
its Christmas cheer

02:40.027 --> 02:43.397
after the festive rush,
so... no touching.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.133
Jenkins,
I'm getting this strange,
almost subliminal sense

02:46.133 --> 02:48.135
that you don't want us
to touch it?

02:48.135 --> 02:50.037
- Uh...
- Jenkins, come on!

02:50.037 --> 02:53.241
We've got a door to catch.
Let's vamoose.
Let's giddyup.

02:53.241 --> 02:57.911
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.680
You sure you guys
are gonna be okay?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.882
Yeah. We're gonna be here
at the Library

03:01.882 --> 03:05.386
with a little quiet time
like little church mice.

03:09.457 --> 03:12.926
Let's get this party started!

03:12.926 --> 03:14.061
( chuckles )

03:14.061 --> 03:17.265
( Christmas music playing )

03:22.903 --> 03:25.138
So, what do you think?

03:25.138 --> 03:27.341
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.877
Uh, I'm at a loss for words,
literally.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.445
Knew you would love them.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.614
I was worried they were gonna
be a little understated,

03:33.614 --> 03:35.316
but now that I see them
with you guys,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.150
they're perfect!
( chuckles )

03:37.150 --> 03:39.186
- Try 'em on.
- Right now?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.154
- Uh, I don't want to ruin it
by wearing it.
- It's warm in the Library.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.357
- It's so...
- Go for it.

03:43.357 --> 03:47.761
Listen, I don't want to get
the delicious eggnog on this
beautiful craftsmanship.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.130
I think I'm gonna put
one of these stars

03:50.130 --> 03:53.033
on this portrait
of Septimus the Seer.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.603
He won't mind.
Probably saw it coming.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.438
Jenkins said don't put
any tacky decorations up--

03:57.438 --> 03:58.939
Cassandra:
Well, Jenkins isn't here.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.642
And one man's tacky
is another girl's tasteful.

04:01.642 --> 04:05.112
Ooh, Ezekiel, hand me
that tinsel baby Jesus.

04:05.112 --> 04:07.981
Ezekiel?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.583
Where'd he go?

04:18.191 --> 04:19.393
( zaps )

04:21.562 --> 04:24.732
Voices:
* A day for stealing

04:24.732 --> 04:29.036
* A day for trouble
and much double-dealing *

04:29.036 --> 04:33.807
* Hooray for greed
and laws made for breaking *

04:33.807 --> 04:38.746
* We're giving up giving
for Happy Thankstaking *

04:38.746 --> 04:41.449
( cheering )

04:41.449 --> 04:44.017
Happy Thankstaking, girls.

04:44.017 --> 04:47.054
Ooh, Charity.
( chuckles )

04:47.054 --> 04:50.558
- This is...
- It's a Crowlex watch.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.760
I stole it from Value Palace.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.462
This is lovely.

04:54.462 --> 04:58.131
You may put the price tag
on the shrine, dearie.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.801
Ooh!

05:00.801 --> 05:03.303
I nicked this one from the mall
for you, Mum.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.140
- Ooh.
- ( music playing )

05:07.140 --> 05:12.513
Thank you.
Ooh, that is perfect!

05:12.513 --> 05:15.883
Just remember, love,
it's the price that counts.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.719
We are doing him proud
this year, aren't we?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.554
( door opens )

05:20.554 --> 05:24.358
( gasps )
Ezekiel! Oh, my boy.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.460
Happy Thankstaking, love.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.162
You are just in time
to give me my gift.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.098
Hello, Mum.

05:31.098 --> 05:34.935
Charity, Honor, Mercy.

05:38.872 --> 05:42.676
- What's this?
- Uh, it's the glass figurine
you said you wanted.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.645
I thought it'd be nice,
you know.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.380
- You've got
a collection going--
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.816
I mean, this.
There's no price tag.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.918
- ( gasping )
- You bought this.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.988
How am I supposed to honor
the Saint of Thieves
with a bought gift?

05:54.988 --> 05:58.526
The whole point is you have to
give Mum something you stole.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.562
We're celebrating
the Patron Saint of Thieves.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.565
He can't accept a gift
that isn't stolen.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.900
- He's not real!
- Neither is Santa.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.003
Which is why we celebrate
Thankstaking Day.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.605
And you give the gifts
to me.

06:11.605 --> 06:16.544
But the gift
must be stolen.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.145
You know I don't steal
anymore.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.346
"Can't steal"
is more like it.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.381
- You never could.
- ( laughter )

06:21.381 --> 06:24.217
- I can steal just fine.
- He's never had a knack
for the family business.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.787
Well, actually
I have quite the knack.
That's not the point.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.122
Remember when he stole
that stupid egg thing?

06:29.122 --> 06:31.191
( laughter )

06:31.191 --> 06:33.026
It was a Fabergé egg,
okay?

06:33.026 --> 06:36.363
Well, last month,
your baby sister Mercy here,

06:36.363 --> 06:38.432
stole a pickup truck
with a dual hemi

06:38.432 --> 06:41.702
right off the lot.
It was the crime of the century.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.571
Congratulations, Mercy.
A pickup truck.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.305
A dual hemi pickup truck!

06:45.305 --> 06:48.275
You know, you should try
and be a little bit more
like your sisters.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.278
He's not even in our league.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.546
I'm not in your league?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.448
If you can't make it
in crime, lad,

06:54.448 --> 06:58.586
you-- you really need
to figure out what it is
you're doing with your life.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.855
You want to know
what I'm doing with my life?

07:01.855 --> 07:06.460
Saving yours and yours
and yours

07:06.460 --> 07:09.663
and every damn person
you know!

07:09.663 --> 07:12.365
Remember last year, hmm?
When the world didn't end?

07:12.365 --> 07:15.603
Well, that was because of me.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.971
Yeah, I've traveled the world.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.475
I've traveled through time,
alternate realities.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.812
I've battled demons,
giants, and beasts.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.280
And for your information,
Mother,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.650
Santa is real.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.853
I know, 'cause I met him.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.196
Did you sit on his lap?

07:43.196 --> 07:46.433
- ( laughter )
- ( door closes )

07:46.433 --> 07:52.405
Girls, stop it, stop it.
You've upset-- you've upset
your brother.

07:52.405 --> 07:57.010
Ezekiel.
Oh, Zekey, stop it! Wait.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.880
Listen, love,
it's good you got
an imagination.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.815
You think I'm making it
all up?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.051
Just because
you can't steal, that--

08:04.051 --> 08:07.420
I can steal, Mother!
I have chosen not to!

08:07.420 --> 08:09.456
I'm doing something important
with my life.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.258
( chuckles )
Magic?

08:11.258 --> 08:15.529
What are you gonna do?
Birthday parties?
Shriner conventions?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.565
I am talking about--

08:17.565 --> 08:19.299
actually, you know what?
Forget it.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.268
- Come see for yourself.
- ( grunts )

08:21.268 --> 08:24.437
Take a look at this.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.108
Does this look imaginary
to you, Mum?

08:28.108 --> 08:32.079
( gasps )
Our shed is bigger
on the inside.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.282
This is the Library.
Yeah, yeah, it's a magic door.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.751
And-- and you spin the globe
and it locks on to any door
in the world.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.653
Because that's how cool
the Library is.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.022
I mean, this is where
I work now.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.224
It's who I am.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.559
You know,
it's the most magical,
secretive,

08:45.559 --> 08:47.895
important place on Earth.

08:47.895 --> 08:52.099
And it is full of the most
improbable, impossible stuff

08:52.099 --> 08:53.500
you've ever dreamt of.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.368
And no one knows about it
'cause no one can.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.206
It is top secret.
No one's even supposed to know
that it exists.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.610
Especially you, Mum.
All right, uh, look,
you know what? We have to go.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.311
You were right.
I was joking.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.313
Uncle Harold,
he put me up to it.
That flaming drunkard.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.750
All right, good-bye now.
Merry Christmas and
Happy Thankstaking.

09:09.750 --> 09:14.588
( exhales )
Stone? Cassandra?
I'm back.

09:19.627 --> 09:20.961
- I'm sorry. ( stammers )
- No, no, no, no!

09:20.961 --> 09:22.730
I gotta take one more look.
No, no, no.

09:22.730 --> 09:26.066
I gotta take one more look.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.235
( exhales sharply )
Look at this.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.471
Look at the ergonomics.
Deceptively simple.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.507
Once you cut this bronco loose,
then you better back up, boy!

09:34.507 --> 09:36.143
'Cause it'll kick you
in the head.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.713
Hey, if I'm honest,
I like this more than I do
the magic door.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.749
Guys, where's the globe?

09:41.749 --> 09:44.985
Someone stole
the magic globe. Oh!

09:46.954 --> 09:48.555
( gasps )

09:48.555 --> 09:49.923
Someone stole
the magic door.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.558
- Oh, God, Mum.
- We need to call--

09:51.558 --> 09:53.326
Call Baird right--
did you just say--

09:53.326 --> 09:56.697
- "Mum"?
- Sorry, n-- uh,

09:56.697 --> 09:58.999
I might have given the, uh,
impression that I was

09:58.999 --> 10:01.034
the black sheep
of my family.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.804
But, um, in actual reality,
I'm more like the black sheep

10:03.804 --> 10:06.940
in a flock of black sheep,
and my mum is the shepherd.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.709
Your mother stole
the magic door?

10:08.709 --> 10:10.077
What was she doing here,
Jones?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.745
Well, I-- you know how it gets
with family.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.747
They just get all up
in your face and you just--

10:13.747 --> 10:14.948
Bring the to
the secret magic library

10:14.948 --> 10:16.249
to steal the secret
magic door?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.617
That never happens.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.819
How good is she?

10:18.819 --> 10:20.620
Uh, as a mother? Okay.
Not great.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.190
- As a thief.
- Uh, okay, not great.

10:23.190 --> 10:26.493
Wrong, Jones, all right?
She stole a magic door.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.997
- She can go anywhere she wants.
- We need to get it back.
Where did she take it?

10:29.997 --> 10:33.300
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
You are not meeting my family.
Yeah, yeah.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.303
This is what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna sort this out alone.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.771
( ringing )

10:37.771 --> 10:39.606
Hello?
Oh, Eve, thank God!

10:39.606 --> 10:40.808
( grunting )

10:40.808 --> 10:44.311
Flynn was right.
This is wonderful.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.414
I'd say I told you so,
but I'm too relaxed
even to be right.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.548
Eve:
How are things with you?

10:48.548 --> 10:49.917
Actually, we have a problem.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.019
Problem?
What's the problem?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.921
No! No!
Cass, please, please, please.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.989
They're my family.
I'll sort it out, please!

10:55.989 --> 10:58.258
- I thought we were your family.
- You're a different sort
of family!

10:58.258 --> 10:59.860
- Eve: Cass! Cass,
what's the problem?
- I like you guys. Please!

10:59.860 --> 11:01.895
Please, please!
I'm begging you!
I'm begging you!

11:01.895 --> 11:03.496
- Cassandra?
- I've never seen
him like this.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.299
- Me neither.
- What's the problem?

11:06.299 --> 11:08.802
It's okay.
We got everything sorted out.
I found it.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.972
The bottle opener was in
the bottle opener drawer
with the bottle openers.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.274
- All good.
- Okay.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.976
Flynn, can you ask Jenkins
to get me one of those drinks

11:15.976 --> 11:17.577
with the little umbrellas
inside?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.246
- Actually two.
- Two umbrellas?

11:19.246 --> 11:22.883
Drinks. Bye, kids.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.517
I can't believe
you made me lie for you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.286
Ezekiel, I am not a li--

11:26.286 --> 11:28.121
- Muah!
- Hey, man.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.523
You're amazing,
you're fantastic!
You're my Christmas miracles.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.359
- I'll see you guys later.
- Wait, where do you think
you're going?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.461
- To get back the door.
- Where does she even live?

11:34.461 --> 11:36.596
- Just outside
of Sydney, Australia.
- That explains the accent.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.499
Problem. How are you going
to get 8,000 miles
across the world

11:39.499 --> 11:41.668
with no magic door?

11:41.668 --> 11:43.570
- Solution.
- No.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.038
- Yes. Yep.
- Nope. No way!

11:45.038 --> 11:47.207
Yep! It's time to let
this kitty purr.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.109
Oh, no, no, no.
You're not coming with me.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.844
Jones, I'm not passing up
a chance to drive this thing.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.514
I am not letting this sleigh
out of my sight,

11:54.514 --> 11:56.016
especially with the two of you
in it.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.717
It's all or nothing, Ezekiel.
What's it gonna be?

11:57.717 --> 12:01.121
All right, fine.
But don't say I didn't warn you.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.291
Hey, uh, don't we need reindeer?
You know, Comet, Cancer,

12:04.291 --> 12:07.360
- Flasher, Nixon?
- What? No.
They aren't canonical, okay?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.129
Reindeer didn't show up
in Santa's legends

12:09.129 --> 12:11.364
until "The Night Before
Christmas," 1823.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.201
- It must run on rocket fuel.
- Nope. Christmas cheer.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.737
All the goodwill
running through the world
at this time of year, see?

12:17.737 --> 12:20.007
Oh, except it's nearly empty.

12:20.007 --> 12:23.276
It's got its own key!

12:23.276 --> 12:25.578
It's got a candy cane key.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.747
( engine starting )

12:27.747 --> 12:29.049
( exhales sharply )

12:31.885 --> 12:33.086
Careful, you don't need
to show off.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.721
Just take it nice
and gentle.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.090
Hey, hey, hey!
Settle down.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.758
Trying to get the hang
of this bronco.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.993
Don't break it! Don't break it!
Don't break it!

12:39.993 --> 12:43.096
Ah!
( grunting )

12:47.734 --> 12:49.369
I think I got it.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.605
Whoa!
Santa's goggles!

12:52.605 --> 12:54.007
- Get in.
- I'm in.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.708
- I'm already in.
- ( engine starting )

12:55.708 --> 12:56.910
( sleigh screeching )

13:00.680 --> 13:03.650
Stone:
Get ready to drop the hammer
and raise the throttle.

13:03.650 --> 13:08.121
- Let this tiger bite.
- Cassandra: Stop calling
it animals!

13:09.556 --> 13:11.691
( Cassandra screams )

13:11.691 --> 13:12.826
( Stone grunts )

13:12.826 --> 13:16.329
( all grunting, gasping )

13:16.329 --> 13:19.499
Sorry. Should have took
into consideration
the jet stream.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.934
- Ha! Oh!
- Aah!

13:20.934 --> 13:23.971
- You all right?
- You don't get to drive
anymore.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.139
What if she's used the door
and it's all gone wrong?

13:26.139 --> 13:30.577
What-- what if she's stuck
in nether space or in limbo?

13:30.577 --> 13:34.814
Or what if she's used
the door to steal Christmas
presents from around the world?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.985
Mum! Mum?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.152
Wow.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.290
Huh.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.359
I know they said Christmas
has gone commercial,
but this...

13:46.359 --> 13:47.995
is weird.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.762
It's the Patron Saint
of Thieves.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.933
A family of thieves?

13:52.933 --> 13:55.835
- Today is Thankstaking Day.
- Thankstaking?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.871
It's a thieves' Christmas,
all right?

13:57.871 --> 14:01.174
It's-- it's a darkened version
of-- of the festive season,
all right?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.243
Where robbery and greed
are celebrated,

14:03.243 --> 14:05.913
not giving,
not generosity.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.480
Saint of Thieves.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.850
In stories,
it's like Santa's bad brother.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.954
Huh. I can see
the familial resemblance.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.056
- She's not upstairs.
- Guys, you gotta see this.

14:16.056 --> 14:20.060
Guys, I found--
I found the globe.

14:20.060 --> 14:24.364
Oh! Oh, Ezekiel, crikey.
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.033
Having fun, are we, Mum?

14:26.033 --> 14:29.336
Oh, these?
Uh, this is not how it looks.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.940
Really? 'Cause it looks like
you've been using
the magic door

14:32.940 --> 14:34.341
to steal other people's
Christmas presents.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.843
Okay, then it is how it looks.
So sue me.

14:36.843 --> 14:39.079
Look, I've been
celebrating Thankstaking.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.515
Greed is good.
You know, I got greedy. Good!

14:42.515 --> 14:44.151
Guys, you gotta see this.

14:44.151 --> 14:47.720
Cassandra Cillian.
Mrs. Jones, It's so nice
to meet you.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.024
Ezekiel has told us, well,
absolutely nothing about you.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.127
I should hope not.
I taught him better
than that. Tea?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.862
Yeah.

14:55.862 --> 14:59.799
Guys!
Do you know what this is?

14:59.799 --> 15:03.703
It's "The Concert"
by Vermeer.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.506
In 1990, two men posed
as police officers

15:06.506 --> 15:08.341
and walked into
the Gardner Museum in Boston

15:08.341 --> 15:11.211
and stole this masterpiece,
all right?

15:11.211 --> 15:13.280
No one knows where it's been
for 27 years.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.783
I do.
Mum, what have you done?

15:16.783 --> 15:20.053
I quite liked it.
Maybe in the loo?

15:20.053 --> 15:23.723
Mum, this painting was stolen
by the most dangerous man
in the world,

15:23.723 --> 15:25.625
and you just stole it
from him.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.129
Well, with a magic door,
he's hardly gonna catch me,
is he?

15:29.129 --> 15:32.699
No, Mum, this man will.

15:32.699 --> 15:36.069
This man you cannot
hide from.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.937
This man does not forgive.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.472
Problem!

15:39.472 --> 15:41.441
The globe is on fire.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.281
That wasn't me.
It was like that when I got it.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.188
( all screaming )

15:56.856 --> 15:58.291
( whimpering )

15:58.291 --> 16:00.893
I'm getting pretty good
at flying this thing.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.363
( whimpering )

16:03.363 --> 16:05.632
We're coming up
over Geneva.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.269
- Brace!
- ( all screaming )

16:09.269 --> 16:11.738
- ( groans )
- That's it!

16:11.738 --> 16:14.041
Next time, I drive.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.109
- Ha.
- Okay.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.945
So someone explain to me
what this bank is.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.281
Well, legend has it
it's a bank for thieves

16:21.281 --> 16:22.882
to protect their loot
from other thieves.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.218
You can deposit what you want,
they don't ask questions.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.619
It's guaranteed
thief-proof.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.521
Ezekiel, have you ever had
an account there?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.757
No. I never held on to what
I stole for long enough.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.993
- Like that egg.
- Mum, enough about the egg.
And it was a Fabergé egg.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.397
I don't care what perfume
you put on it, love,
it was a stupid gift.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.699
Mum, don't.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.573
So, where's this
Bank of Thieves?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.041
Here.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.677
- Where's the door?
- Exactly.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.080
Fancy a game of chess?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.382
You don't know
how to play chess.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.222
Hmm.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.495
Well, that's really not
how you play.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.199
Stone:
Seems to be working for him.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.680
- ( gasps )
- How'd you do that?

17:27.680 --> 17:31.151
- You're in my world now.
- The chess pieces were
the combination.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.585
It's incredible.

17:35.688 --> 17:39.259
Mum, once we're inside,
I need you to do one thing
for me.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.827
Don't call me
by my real name.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.029
- What's wrong with Ezekiel?
- Don't even say that out loud!

17:43.029 --> 17:45.465
You're gonna draw a lot
of unwanted attention.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.101
- Why?
- Because every no-gooder
has heard of Ez-- of him.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.770
Oh, please, you're talking
like my son's famous.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.472
Unfortunately, he is.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.248
( gasps )

18:05.685 --> 18:08.788
"Maintain the honor"?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.657
Honor amongst thieves,
I guess.

18:10.657 --> 18:14.361
This is the one place
thieves cannot rob,
steal, or kill.

18:14.361 --> 18:18.064
What would happen is someone
got caught stealing here?

18:18.064 --> 18:21.201
( groaning )

18:21.201 --> 18:22.735
( screams )

18:24.904 --> 18:27.540
- ( gasps )
- They're liquidated.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.342
Good luck on the adventure,
kids.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.178
Let me know how
it all works out.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.313
- ( groans )
- Come on, Mum.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.719
Depositing one Fabergé egg.
Total value, 35 million.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.855
You didn't tell me
that stupid egg was worth
that much.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.324
Google it, Mum!

18:47.627 --> 18:50.630
( indistinct chatter )

18:54.667 --> 18:59.206
Look at this.
South American cartel,
Russian mafia,

18:59.206 --> 19:00.773
the Chinese Triads.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.142
It's like every flavor
of criminal in the world.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.545
Why are they all twitching?

19:05.545 --> 19:10.283
You \silly girl.
That's the ancient thieves'
language of Fingerthumbs.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.019
We're all fluent
in our family.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.487
- Mm!
- ( gasps )

19:14.487 --> 19:17.790
Careful, boy.
If you don't speak
Fingerthumbs,

19:17.790 --> 19:19.926
you don't know what
your hands are saying.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.694
Scratching your earlobe
at someone

19:21.694 --> 19:24.864
is just about the rudest thing
you can say to a thief.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.236
- Can I get a beer?
- Yes.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.870
Looks like the vault's
one more level down.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.240
- We're gonna need
a clear-out.
- A what?

19:33.240 --> 19:36.509
A distraction to get
the guards away from
the doorway.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.812
Stone, you speak Russian,
right?

19:42.749 --> 19:43.850
( cheering )

19:45.252 --> 19:48.455
( chattering )

19:54.727 --> 19:57.730
( speaking Russian )

20:11.544 --> 20:13.413
I think this fell
out of your pocket.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.947
That's not my wallet.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.319
That's my wallet.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.354
Give that to me, thief.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.090
Who you call thief, thief?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.758
( grumbling )

20:25.758 --> 20:29.262
Maintain the honor.
Maintain the honor!

20:29.262 --> 20:32.465
( grunting )

20:41.308 --> 20:45.945
Mum, you are here for one reason
and one reason only,

20:45.945 --> 20:48.981
and that is to show me exactly
where you took that painting.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.051
So that's no risks,
no trouble,

20:52.051 --> 20:53.720
and do not touch anything.

20:53.720 --> 20:57.123
Look, the magic door put me
directly inside the vault.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.427
Once we're in there,
I'll know exactly where
to put this.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.661
Oh!

21:01.661 --> 21:03.963
Not so easy.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.698
( exhales deeply )

21:08.335 --> 21:09.802
Maybe we should
forget about this.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.771
I mean, we can just leave
the painting right here.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.140
I mean,
you saw what they did
to people who steal.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.477
Mum, we're not stealing.
We're putting something back.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.479
All right, see that button
over there?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.314
Press that,
it'll disable the alarms.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.282
I'm gonna get there,
turn it off,

21:23.282 --> 21:24.851
and we'll have a clear path
to the vault.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.321
How are you gonna get
to that button?

21:28.321 --> 21:29.689
By being me.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.296
( grunting )

21:44.036 --> 21:46.873
- Huh.
- Watch out!

21:46.873 --> 21:49.876
( grunting )

21:57.917 --> 22:00.353
How did you do that?

22:09.529 --> 22:11.297
Everything I've seen today,

22:11.297 --> 22:14.667
the wallet lift,
the laser dance, this,

22:14.667 --> 22:19.171
with all those skills,
how come you're not
a great thief?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.441
Okay, Mum,
why don't you tell me

22:21.441 --> 22:23.342
which slip did you take
the painting from?

22:23.342 --> 22:26.112
This one. 203.

22:31.384 --> 22:32.519
Ah. All right.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.521
- ( alarm blaring )
- Huh?

22:34.521 --> 22:36.556
Mum, the door!
No, no, no, no, no.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.557
No!

22:41.260 --> 22:44.497
- ( alarm blaring )
- I don't get it.
We did everything right.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.899
( exhales sharply )

22:46.899 --> 22:48.901
( door opening )

22:54.173 --> 22:57.043
Oh, no. It's him.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.813
Congratulations.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.616
Very few thieves
ever get this far.

23:03.616 --> 23:08.287
You have earned
my applause for your skill
and your audacity.

23:08.287 --> 23:10.857
No, really, it was--
it was nothing.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.793
Forgive me,
but you have the advantage.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.562
I don't even know your names.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.164
Uh, I-- I'm Lenore Jones.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.366
Ms. Lenore Jones.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.570
- Mum!
- Thi-- this is my son...
Ezekiel.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.837
Mum!

23:24.837 --> 23:27.440
Ezekiel Jones?

23:27.440 --> 23:32.011
The Ezekiel Jones?

23:33.613 --> 23:37.784
I wondered when our paths
would finally cross.

23:37.784 --> 23:41.053
Uh, we weren't stealing.
We were actually
returning some--

23:41.053 --> 23:43.590
Mum, shut up, okay?
You've got us into
enough trouble.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.859
Don't you speak to me like that.
Who do you think you are?

23:46.859 --> 23:50.396
Ezekiel Jones, the greatest
thief in the world.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.299
- What? Him?
- Which leads me to ask,

23:53.299 --> 23:55.602
apart from being
Ezekiel's mother,

23:55.602 --> 23:57.470
who the hell are you?

23:57.470 --> 23:59.405
I'm-- I'm no one.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.408
Precisely.
And so I wonder, Mr. Jones,

24:02.408 --> 24:05.512
how did a low-rent,
low-class nothing

24:05.512 --> 24:07.379
of a shoplifter like her

24:07.379 --> 24:10.082
defeat the security
of my bank?

24:10.082 --> 24:12.184
She is not nothing.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.221
Oh, she is the very definition
of the word, I'm afraid.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.323
And yet she still broke in.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.658
How?

24:18.658 --> 24:23.563
I know how to keep
my gob shut, don't I?

24:23.563 --> 24:25.031
Jones don't crack.

24:25.031 --> 24:28.134
( demonic voice )
How did you break in?

24:31.370 --> 24:33.139
- With a magic door.
- Mum!

24:33.139 --> 24:35.441
I'm sorry! I don't know why
that just slipped out.

24:35.441 --> 24:37.209
( normal voice )
Why not use it again?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.778
Mum, don't tell him.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.580
( demonic voice )
Why?

24:40.580 --> 24:43.115
Because it overheated
and then we had to us--

24:43.115 --> 24:44.817
- Mum, don't!
- Go on.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.053
- In Santa's sl--
- Mum! Shut up.

24:47.053 --> 24:50.790
- Tell me.
- In Santa's sleigh.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.792
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

24:52.792 --> 24:58.264
( normal voice )
The Vessel... is here?

25:02.434 --> 25:04.503
Oh, you wonderful woman!

25:04.503 --> 25:05.838
I take it all back.

25:05.838 --> 25:10.176
You are the greatest thief
in the world.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.510
- I am?
- Oh, you are.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.112
For you have
brought me something

25:13.112 --> 25:17.083
I have been searching for
across unimaginable lifetimes.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.619
Guards! Sweep the streets.

25:19.619 --> 25:23.255
Find the sleigh
and bring it to me.
( chuckles )

25:23.255 --> 25:25.257
Go!

25:25.257 --> 25:28.094
How'd you do that
with your voice?
You-- you hypnotized her!

25:28.094 --> 25:33.432
Uh, she's a thief.
And all thieves must
answer me truthfully.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.234
It is my right.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.937
Just as Thankstaking
is my day.

25:37.937 --> 25:41.007
You find me
at my most powerful, boy.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.911
And soon, Santa's sleigh
shall be mine to destroy.

25:44.911 --> 25:49.982
And then I'll finally
have revenge upon
my accursed brother.

25:49.982 --> 25:53.285
Oh, my God.
You're the Patron Saint
of Thieves.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.921
The Patron!

25:54.921 --> 25:56.889
In the flesh.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.061
( chattering )

26:05.932 --> 26:07.767
Clear the room!

26:07.767 --> 26:09.636
Everyone must go. Now!

26:12.538 --> 26:14.173
Out!

26:14.173 --> 26:17.209
Everyone keep moving.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.980
- Bring it in.
- We found this sitting out
in the square.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.348
Stop!

26:22.348 --> 26:25.752
They got Santa's sleigh.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.454
Jenkins is gonna be so mad.

26:28.454 --> 26:31.323
( dance music playing )

26:34.360 --> 26:35.928
Having a good time,
Colonel?

26:35.928 --> 26:37.930
I'm trying to drown this
all out.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.899
So much for
a relaxing time.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.835
Is it just me or does Santa
have horrible taste in music?

26:42.835 --> 26:46.005
Horrible. Look, I'm done.
Santa's driving me crazy.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.074
Theses elves are driving
me crazy.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.742
- All I hear
is this ringing in my ear.
- ( phone ringing )

26:49.742 --> 26:52.144
- No, no, that's your phone.
- What? Oh.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.480
- Oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- ( ringing )

26:54.480 --> 26:57.316
- Yeah, hello.
- Jenkins, hey, hi.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.518
Remember when you said
you didn't know what you wanted
to get me for Christmas?

26:59.518 --> 27:02.321
Well, what I really want
is for you to help me
with something,

27:02.321 --> 27:04.356
and then not tell
Flynn and Baird that you did.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.558
All right, Miss Cillian,
explain.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.461
We broke the door
and we really need to get it
working again because--

27:09.461 --> 27:10.830
well, don't worry
about that right now.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.666
- Explain "broke."
- Well-- hi, Jenkins.

27:13.666 --> 27:18.104
Um, it overheated and then
it caught fire a little bit.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.372
Caught fire?

27:20.372 --> 27:22.975
All right, very well.
I can you through
the repairs.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.244
Okay.
And then we need you to do
something else.

27:25.244 --> 27:28.314
Something else you want me
to keep secret?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.949
Both: Big time.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.719
What's the point in destroying
Santa's sleigh?

27:32.719 --> 27:35.321
No sleigh,
no Christmas.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.323
No Christmas,
no Santa.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.658
Ahh.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.794
It's the only way
to end him.

27:41.794 --> 27:45.131
To make the children
of the world stop
believing in him.

27:45.131 --> 27:49.869
And then he shall just be
a tired old man fading
into nothingness,

27:49.869 --> 27:53.639
whereas I--
I shall be stronger than ever.

27:53.639 --> 27:57.609
Sir, we found Santa's sleigh.

27:57.609 --> 28:01.447
It's all because of you,
Mrs. Jones.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.716
Now, if you'll excuse me.

28:06.786 --> 28:10.689
So, you're a world-famous
thief, eh?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.691
Yeah, I've been trying
to tell you.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.061
And-- and you've broken
into banks and museums.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.296
Yes, but I've given up
that life now.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.731
I'm your mother.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.967
How come I didn't know
anything about this?

28:20.967 --> 28:23.770
- Mum, because
you never listen.
- You selfish child!

28:23.770 --> 28:26.605
I took you in
off the streets!
I gave you a home!

28:26.605 --> 28:29.008
Made you part of my family.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.911
And you had millions
of dollars in your hands?

28:31.911 --> 28:34.613
Where's mine? Eh?

28:34.613 --> 28:37.817
They're going to sing songs
about you.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.452
( chuckles )
The sleigh is here.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.355
Now there's just one
little thing I need you to do.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.325
You see, to destroy it,
I need to own it first.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.627
It's a terms and conditions
kind of thing.

28:48.627 --> 28:53.599
I need you to gift me
the sleigh willingly,
you understand?

28:53.599 --> 28:55.167
No tricks this time.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.670
But I can only accept a gift
that has been stolen.

28:58.670 --> 29:02.341
Then she can't gift it to you
because she didn't steal it.

29:02.341 --> 29:05.644
I did, and I would never
gift the sleigh to you.

29:05.644 --> 29:08.380
Ezekiel's actually right.

29:08.380 --> 29:13.585
Unless, of course,
I was to steal it
from him first.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.355
There, nicked it.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.457
Saint of Thieves,

29:18.457 --> 29:22.028
I gift Santa's sleigh...

29:22.028 --> 29:24.196
to you.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.197
( chuckles )

29:32.872 --> 29:36.442
What are you doing?
You said they'd
sing songs about me.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.278
Oh, they will.
Posthumously.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.048
The penalty for breaking
into my vault is death.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.516
I don't care who you are,
or in your case,

29:44.516 --> 29:46.652
whose mother you are.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.120
I'll be back
to deal with you

29:48.120 --> 29:52.124
once I verify
the sleigh is real.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.927
Thank you.

29:54.927 --> 29:57.629
Okay, so now I know how
to fix the magic door,

29:57.629 --> 29:59.331
but the magic door
is in Australia,

29:59.331 --> 30:02.969
and we're in Geneva,
which is not Australia.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.971
You know how Jenkins does
that thing where he pops up

30:04.971 --> 30:07.673
in the mirrors and the windows
and the picture frames?

30:07.673 --> 30:10.709
- Yeah, the thing
Judson used to do.
- Tell me, Cassandra,

30:10.709 --> 30:12.578
how do you think he's able
to do that?

30:12.578 --> 30:16.548
- Magic?
- Yeah.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.886
I can't believe you hid your
real life from me, Ezekiel.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.453
Mum, we can talk
about this later.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.989
Right now, we need
to get out of these ropes

30:22.989 --> 30:24.790
before the guards
come back and kill us.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.325
Didn't you listen
to anything I taught you?

30:26.325 --> 30:29.361
You hold tension in your body
when they're tying the knots.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.698
That way, when you relax,
you got some slack.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.901
- Yes, Mum, what do you
think I'm doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

30:34.901 --> 30:37.469
- Finding the slack?
- Yep. Slipping the knot.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.005
Both: Et voila!

30:39.005 --> 30:40.839
So you did listen to me, hmm?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.042
Of course I do, Mum.
I've always listened to you.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.211
- Then why'd you cheat me?
- Cheat you?

30:45.211 --> 30:47.113
- How did I do that?
- My share.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.148
You must have made millions.
Where's my cut?

30:49.148 --> 30:52.218
Yes, I stole millions,
but I never kept any of it!

30:52.218 --> 30:54.053
Oh, baloney.
Who doesn't want money?

30:54.053 --> 30:55.554
It was never
about the money!

30:55.554 --> 30:59.391
I stole because it was an art,
and I was an artist.

30:59.391 --> 31:03.329
- I gave it all away.
- So you gave away money
that could have been mine?

31:03.329 --> 31:06.832
I gave it to people
who needed it.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.535
Mum, when I stole
the Sapphire of Qatar,

31:09.535 --> 31:11.803
a hundred kids
went to college.

31:11.803 --> 31:15.107
When I robbed Fort Knox,
hospitals were built.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.543
I've helped them build
roads and dams,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.278
and I've supported people,

31:19.278 --> 31:20.913
people who couldn't
support themselves

31:20.913 --> 31:24.450
for no other reason
than they got unlucky.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.619
That's why the Library
chose me in the first place,

31:27.619 --> 31:28.887
and that's why I gave it up.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.990
I give my talents
freely now, Mum,

31:30.990 --> 31:34.793
for the greater good.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.695
A calling.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.365
All that money?

31:39.365 --> 31:42.034
You weren't just--

31:42.034 --> 31:44.836
you weren't just
a little bit tempted?

31:44.836 --> 31:47.639
When you've got a lot,
you share.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.380
( all snoring )

32:06.125 --> 32:08.327
- ( ghostly moaning )
- ( screaming )

32:08.327 --> 32:11.497
- There's something
in the mirror!
- What now? Oh!

32:11.497 --> 32:16.035
( moaning )
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Future.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.737
Christmas Ghosts!
I hate Christmas Ghosts!

32:18.737 --> 32:23.909
It is not too late to make
amends for your terrible crimes.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.411
Tell us. Anything!

32:25.411 --> 32:30.449
Inside of your dining room,
there is an old globe

32:30.449 --> 32:35.254
with a shocking amount
of new technology inside it.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.057
( engine starting )

32:38.057 --> 32:41.027
That's the real deal.
( chuckles )

32:41.027 --> 32:44.030
Oh, nearly out
of Christmas cheer.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.865
Once the needle hits zero,

32:46.865 --> 32:48.500
you go to work.

32:48.500 --> 32:54.473
And then it's
God bless us, everyone.
( chuckles )

32:54.473 --> 32:55.474
( powers down )

33:01.780 --> 33:04.083
Stone:
Hi, guys.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.751
Bear here with me for a second
here 'cause I'm still--

33:05.751 --> 33:08.820
I'm trying to get the language
of the Fingerthumbs down.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.722
Now, let me see
if I got this right.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.491
What exactly does this mean?

33:12.491 --> 33:15.494
( all grunting )

33:38.016 --> 33:39.785
Feels like
I'm already fluent.

33:39.785 --> 33:43.155
Oh, Mr. and Mother Jones,
we were discussing the matter

33:43.155 --> 33:45.357
of your imminent demise.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.062
Find them! Find them!

33:50.062 --> 33:53.065
- You guys are late.
- Well, we got tied up.

33:53.065 --> 33:54.466
Yeah, I'm betting you guys
have a plan.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.769
Of course we do.
We're Librarians.

33:57.769 --> 34:01.440
Oh, genius!
We're gonna push the sleigh
through the magic door.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.210
Come on.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.812
Oh, dear me. Dear me.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.247
No, no, no, no.
( clicks tongue )

34:08.247 --> 34:10.616
No, that won't do at all.

34:10.616 --> 34:14.320
You are going
precisely nowhere
with my sleigh.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.556
You have lost,
Ezekiel Jones.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.725
Christmas dies...

34:19.725 --> 34:21.727
tonight.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.766
Very disappointed in you,
Ezekiel.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.236
Is that your grand plan?

34:30.236 --> 34:33.705
To push the sleigh
through a magic door?

34:33.705 --> 34:37.376
Well, the door is not
for getting something out.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.178
It's there to let someone in.

34:41.347 --> 34:44.049
I'm so-- am I late? I'm late.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

34:44.049 --> 34:47.353
I got stuck in a conga line.
Hello.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.455
- This is for you.
- What is this?

34:49.455 --> 34:52.691
A pink slip.
A vehicle registration.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.794
By the way, the sender
also included this note.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.402
"My dear brother,

35:03.402 --> 35:06.505
I am giving you
a Christmas present--

35:06.505 --> 35:07.573
my sleigh.

35:07.573 --> 35:12.211
I gift it to you
willingly and freely,

35:12.211 --> 35:13.645
Santa Claus."

35:13.645 --> 35:16.248
He's giving it to me?
I don't understand.

35:16.248 --> 35:22.120
You see, the Patron Saint
of Thieves cannot accept
a gift that is not stolen.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.889
And this gift
is given freely

35:23.889 --> 35:25.991
by it rightful owner.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.026
Which means you cannot
accept it.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.961
Not now, not ever.

35:29.961 --> 35:35.100
The sleigh and Christmas
will always be safe from you.

35:35.100 --> 35:39.104
Forever. You lose.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.372
Big time.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.974
You can't do this to me!

35:42.974 --> 35:44.876
Not in my bank!

35:44.876 --> 35:46.678
Not on my day!

35:46.678 --> 35:48.380
It's not fair!

35:48.380 --> 35:52.150
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

35:52.150 --> 35:55.587
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

35:55.587 --> 35:58.023
It's not fair!

35:58.023 --> 36:00.025
It's so not fair!

36:00.025 --> 36:01.560
Whoa.
What happened there?

36:01.560 --> 36:04.230
Well, I think
the Prince of Thieves

36:04.230 --> 36:06.532
just showed us
his true face.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.934
You know, it's been
my experience that behind

36:08.934 --> 36:11.537
every egotistical blowhard,

36:11.537 --> 36:14.440
there is a petulant,
scared little boy

36:14.440 --> 36:16.442
So, what do we do
with it now?

36:16.442 --> 36:18.244
I will bring him back
to Santa.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.212
Well,
if you will excuse me,

36:20.212 --> 36:22.080
I have a really
terrible vacation

36:22.080 --> 36:23.882
that I have to get back to.

36:23.882 --> 36:26.218
Oh, oh, and-- and...

36:26.218 --> 36:27.886
my gift to the three of you

36:27.886 --> 36:30.256
is that neither
Baird nor Flynn

36:30.256 --> 36:33.492
ever have to know
anything about this.

36:33.492 --> 36:37.296
Merry Christmas.
Come along, young man.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.798
Excuse us.
Love your gloves.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.971
( powers down )

36:45.971 --> 36:49.308
All right, thank to Santa's act
of generosity to his bro,

36:49.308 --> 36:50.776
the cheer-o-meter is full.

36:50.776 --> 36:53.512
We can finally fly
this puppy outta here.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.815
No, thank you.
I have had enough
sleigh riding for now.

36:56.815 --> 37:01.086
Mum! You will not believe
the night we've had!

37:01.086 --> 37:03.121
We saw a-- a ghost!

37:03.121 --> 37:04.690
Boo.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.558
( all screaming )

37:07.993 --> 37:10.429
Ah, guess we're good to go.

37:10.429 --> 37:14.032
Mrs. Jones, it was, well,

37:14.032 --> 37:15.634
not exactly a pleasure.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.073
Hope to see you again soon.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.744
My son has excellent taste
in friends.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.453
- Let's go.
- Oh, hey, uh, Stone?

37:34.453 --> 37:37.689
Do you mind, uh,
taking the door as well?

37:49.067 --> 37:53.004
Well, Mum, looks like
we've got one last
sleigh ride to catch.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.506
We do?

37:57.309 --> 38:01.313
Come on.
We've got a festival to fix.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.718
We're going to give back
every last present
that was stolen.

38:10.656 --> 38:14.225
Return gifts
to every grandpa...

38:14.225 --> 38:16.662
mother...

38:16.662 --> 38:18.697
and child.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.733
Because that's what
this holiday is about.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.869
( kids laughing )

38:23.869 --> 38:25.904
Caring for one another.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.341
- Loving one another.
- ( sobbing )

38:31.643 --> 38:34.713
But it's not just gifts
we'll be returning.

38:34.713 --> 38:38.884
We'll be giving
them back joy.

38:49.861 --> 38:53.499
That's why giving is
always better than getting.

38:59.771 --> 39:03.642
Whoo! Ho-ho-ho!

39:03.642 --> 39:07.145
What a rush.
You know, it's exciting
giving things, isn't it?

39:07.145 --> 39:09.047
I mean, who knew?

39:09.047 --> 39:12.918
- Let's go get the next load.
- Oh, uh, Mum,
that's-- that's it.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.153
- What?
- There's no more presents.

39:15.153 --> 39:18.657
What? No. No!

39:18.657 --> 39:21.760
But I could have given
so much more.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.996
Oh, love, I--
oh, my God.

39:24.996 --> 39:29.100
I've lived such a greedy life,
haven't I, Zekey?

39:29.100 --> 39:31.269
Oh, Zekey, I'm--
I'm sorry.

39:31.269 --> 39:34.440
Mum, you adopted four
cuckoo children

39:34.440 --> 39:36.207
who didn't have a place
in the world.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.544
You think all
you taught us was greed?

39:38.544 --> 39:40.779
You gave us love.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.214
You gave us a home.
You gave us a life.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.552
That is what
I learned from you.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.655
Merry Christmas, son.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.760
Merry Christmas, Mum.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.762
I love you, son.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.799
I love you too, Mum.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.540
A little to the left.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.576
A little more.
Perfect!

40:10.576 --> 40:12.511
( globe activating )

40:14.179 --> 40:15.647
Go, go, go, go, go!

40:23.755 --> 40:26.157
- You're back!
- And not a minute too soon.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.294
That is the last time
I take your advice about
needing a vacation.

40:29.294 --> 40:32.197
Point well taken, I concur.
Last time I take
my own advice.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.901
Miss Cillian, Mr. Stone,

40:35.901 --> 40:38.103
how very good to see you
after all this time.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.205
( whispers )
Merry Christmas.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.707
Baird:
So, how was everything here?

40:41.707 --> 40:45.043
- Quiet.
- ( sighs )

40:45.043 --> 40:47.879
Wasn't this facing
the other direction
when we left?

40:47.879 --> 40:49.581
No. No, sir.
I saw it was pointing
in that direction.

40:49.581 --> 40:52.017
- No, I thought 'cause--
- Oh, no, sir. No, no, no.

40:52.017 --> 40:54.520
I think you've had
a little too much eggnog,
muddled your memory a bit.

40:54.520 --> 40:59.024
Point well taken, I concur.
You know, I thought it
would be a good idea

40:59.024 --> 41:00.892
to take a vacation
for the holidays.

41:00.892 --> 41:04.462
- But as it turns out--
- Nothing beats being
with family.

41:06.765 --> 41:10.035
- Here, here.
- Who's up for more eggnog?

41:10.035 --> 41:12.804
Maybe put up some decorations
in the main Library.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.642
Perfect! And you can try on
the sweaters that I made you.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.110
- All: Sweaters?
- Yes!

41:19.110 --> 41:21.713
- Come on!
- ( muttering )
