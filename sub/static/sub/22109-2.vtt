WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.376
(eerie music playing)

00:12.012 --> 00:14.448
(clicking)

00:15.516 --> 00:16.850
(gasps)

00:24.625 --> 00:27.061
34, 35...

00:27.095 --> 00:28.496
37?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.730
No!

00:29.763 --> 00:32.500
Oh, I have to go
all the way around again.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.001
(grunting)

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
(shouting)

00:38.706 --> 00:40.174
(panting)

00:40.208 --> 00:42.009
I had the locker dream again.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.079
Oh, honey,
that's four nights in a row.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.181
Stupid recurring dreams.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.016
Why can't brains come up
with something new?

00:49.049 --> 00:52.019
That's why they're losing
viewers to Netflix. (snores)

00:52.052 --> 00:54.622
Maybe I should talk
to a therapist.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.558
Sweetie, our insurance won't pay
for any more sessions.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.960
Your father used them all up
on grief counseling

00:59.993 --> 01:02.463
after the Halloween candy
ran out.

01:02.496 --> 01:05.065
I've come to accept
that we were lucky to have it

01:05.099 --> 01:07.034
while we did.
(sniffles)

01:07.067 --> 01:08.869
But I know a cheap place
where you can see

01:08.902 --> 01:11.272
the therapists of tomorrow
today.

01:11.305 --> 01:14.108
Behold,
Springfield Community College,

01:14.142 --> 01:17.411
where the students practice...
on you!

01:17.445 --> 01:20.781
I only paid a student dentist
$12 for this brand-new crown.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.416
See?

01:22.450 --> 01:24.285
I don't think
it's supposed to come out.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.287
That's why I paid
a student paralegal to sue him.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.555
I lost!

01:27.588 --> 01:29.590
-(tooth clattering)
-(humming)

01:31.091 --> 01:32.893
(school bell rings)

01:32.926 --> 01:34.662
-Oh, yarr.
-HOMER: Mm.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.565
Yarr! Yarr.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.566
(gulps)

01:38.599 --> 01:40.568
TV must be a circle!

01:40.601 --> 01:42.270
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

01:43.671 --> 01:46.140
Give him the full flea dip
and deluxe under-worming.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.308
I'm not a dog.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.976
And I've been worm-free
for two weeks!

01:49.009 --> 01:50.778
You better muzzle him.
He's a biter.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.413
(grunting)

01:52.446 --> 01:55.683
My name is Annette,
and I'm a therapist-in-training.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.117
I'm also a mother-to-be,

01:57.151 --> 01:59.019
so I know
there's nothing more beautiful

01:59.052 --> 02:01.088
than a child's feelings.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.424
You sound so caring
and professional.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.993
(quietly): When do I give you
the seven dollars?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.661
There's a shoebox by the door.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.129
(school bell rings)

02:09.163 --> 02:10.631
So what does
my locker dream mean?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.300
Am I stressed about school?

02:12.333 --> 02:14.134
I mean,
schools are full of lockers.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.370
Hey, who's
the almost-therapist here?

02:16.404 --> 02:18.206
(Lisa whimpers)

02:20.208 --> 02:21.775
Huh.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.943
Hmm.

02:22.976 --> 02:23.944
Oh.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.112
Ooh.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.214
Huh.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.681
Mm.

02:29.149 --> 02:33.187
You know, I think you
might benefit from art therapy.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.488
Ooh!

02:34.522 --> 02:36.890
Draw in these empty panels

02:36.924 --> 02:38.859
to tell the story
of a typical day

02:38.892 --> 02:41.028
in the life of you,
Sophia Barnum.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.129
Huh?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.798
Once again,
learn the patient's name.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.033
Sorry, Professor.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.468
Lisa Simpson.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.303
Excellent. Continue.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.905
Your light's still on.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.342
LISA:
Art therapy.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.978
Okay, draw a typical day.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.013
(humming)

03:02.683 --> 03:04.151
Ugh! Horrible!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.754
It looks like it was drawn
by an eight-year-old!

03:06.787 --> 03:08.088
(blows)

03:08.121 --> 03:10.123
(humming forcefully)

03:12.025 --> 03:14.194
Ugh!

03:14.228 --> 03:17.064
Oh, boy, I can't wait
to take you to the park.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.233
The other owners
will be so jealous.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.001
You're not my owner.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.736
Uh, I kinda am.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.239
-(Lisa shouts)
-(erasing sounds)

03:25.273 --> 03:27.675
-(shouts)
-(erasing sounds)

03:27.708 --> 03:29.577
(shouts)

03:29.610 --> 03:32.079
(Bart whimpering)

03:32.112 --> 03:33.514
Mmm.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.516
(grunting)

03:35.549 --> 03:37.084
MARGE:
Mm.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.388
I'm hearing
a lot of feelings in here.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.391
You're hearing them
because I am not drawing them!

03:43.424 --> 03:46.126
Aw, sweetie, drawing is tricky.

03:46.159 --> 03:49.129
But you just need to start with
something simple, like people.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.064
Those are people.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.065
Ooh.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.936
(grunts)
It's easy, honey.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.374
Add some eyelashes here,

04:00.408 --> 04:03.043
some crosshatching
to show shadow,

04:03.076 --> 04:06.447
vary the line width here
to accent the outline,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.916
-and voilÃ !
-(gasps)

04:08.949 --> 04:10.083
That's great!

04:10.117 --> 04:11.419
Now in the next panel,

04:11.452 --> 04:13.086
I want her to be looking out
a window,

04:13.120 --> 04:14.988
wondering if she'll ever get out

04:15.022 --> 04:17.591
from under the weight
of her own expectations.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.928
Well, I could make the eyebrows
come down in a "V."

04:20.961 --> 04:23.130
LISA:
That says it all.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.398
(Marge grunts)

04:24.432 --> 04:27.735
Hey, Mom, what if I told you
the things I was feeling

04:27.768 --> 04:29.303
and you drew them?

04:29.337 --> 04:30.971
Okay. But I'm warning you,

04:31.004 --> 04:33.140
I'm not good at drawing
turtle feet.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.075
So if there are any turtles
in this,

04:35.108 --> 04:36.810
they're gonna be wearing
sneakers.

04:36.844 --> 04:37.978
Deal.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.914
It starts with the story
of a regular day...

04:40.948 --> 04:42.950
(jazz playing)

05:10.678 --> 05:12.680
*

05:21.154 --> 05:22.656
(groans softly)

05:22.690 --> 05:26.827
Gosh, I forgot how hard school
can be for a sensitive kid.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.061
It's miserable.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.998
But you captured my feelings
perfectly!

05:31.031 --> 05:32.666
(horn honks)

05:32.700 --> 05:35.068
Annette, wait till you see
my art therapy!

05:35.102 --> 05:36.837
You're gonna love it, too.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.006
Please try to pretend
I'm not here.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.173
Okay, Stephen.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.809
(humming)

05:41.842 --> 05:43.977
Hey, where did it go?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.313
Best marriage counseling ever.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.382
But we still need to discuss

05:48.416 --> 05:50.484
your addiction
to unboxing videos.

05:50.518 --> 05:54.688
Do not make me choose
between you and unboxing.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.828
Manga!

06:00.861 --> 06:02.930
(speaking Japanese)

06:07.200 --> 06:10.871
It's been a week, and I still
can't find my therapy comic.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.039
I'd be just mortified

06:12.072 --> 06:15.075
if even one person saw
my private thoughts...

06:15.108 --> 06:16.844
-(gasps)
-Oh!

06:16.877 --> 06:20.013
(groans) Mom,
can I have permission to swear?

06:20.047 --> 06:22.249
Okay, as long
as it's a tier one.

06:22.282 --> 06:23.250
Damn it!

06:23.283 --> 06:24.685
That didn't work.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.186
Can I go to tier two?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.055
-I'm afraid not.
-Damn it!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.360
And with that seal cut,

06:33.393 --> 06:36.930
we have completed the unboxing
of the outer shipping plastic.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.966
Indeed we have.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.100
(door opens, bell jingles)

06:40.133 --> 06:44.472
You published my private
art therapy as a comic book?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.239
Um, actually,
it's a graphic novel.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.875
The distinctions
are threefold...

06:47.908 --> 06:49.042
-Shut up!
-Okay then.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.111
Um, in my defense,
my wife did it.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.747
Kumiko, how could you?

06:53.781 --> 06:54.982
I have acted shamefully.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.651
I must commit furry cosplay.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.488
(grunting)

07:00.521 --> 07:01.655
Ooh!

07:01.689 --> 07:03.657
There's nothing sexy
about shame!

07:03.691 --> 07:06.594
Except in my native Japan,
where it's our whole thing.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.797
Mr. and Mrs. Book Guy,
you had no right to do this!

07:09.830 --> 07:11.965
These are
my daughter's feelings.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.501
And my doodles.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.935
I shall burn them on a pyre

07:14.968 --> 07:16.937
and disperse them
to the seven winds.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.405
That's all I ask.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.073
(door opens, bell jingles)

07:20.107 --> 07:21.642
LISA:
Hmm?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.243
One Sad Girl, please.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.645
Sad Girl's the best!

07:24.678 --> 07:26.947
It's tragically delicious!

07:27.948 --> 07:29.016
Wait!

07:29.049 --> 07:31.018
Maybe this isn't so bad.
(chuckles)

07:31.051 --> 07:32.986
(gasping)

07:33.020 --> 07:34.454
My Lulus!

07:36.957 --> 07:40.160
*

07:41.361 --> 07:42.996
(indistinct chatter)

07:43.030 --> 07:45.165
Ooh, there she is.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.333
Ask for her autograph.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.668
You ask her, man.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.036
I'm freakin' out.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.871
Wow, Lisa, our cartoon book

07:50.904 --> 07:52.640
seems to have really captured
the...

07:52.673 --> 07:54.875
What's that word
I'm looking for?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.544
Zeitgeist!

07:56.577 --> 07:58.145
Oh, hi, Mel!

07:58.178 --> 07:59.813
Say hi to Barbara for me.

07:59.847 --> 08:03.483
I'm not your messenger boy!

08:03.517 --> 08:04.885
(crickets chirping)

08:04.918 --> 08:06.620
What's so great
about graphic novels?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.455
They're just comic books
with no superheroes

08:08.488 --> 08:11.058
and no cool sound effects
like "Thwam!",

08:11.091 --> 08:12.392
"Ack-ack-ack-ack!",

08:12.425 --> 08:14.995
-and "Fwwwip!"
-Snag! (chuckles)

08:15.028 --> 08:16.730
Lisa, Kumiko called.

08:16.764 --> 08:20.000
She sold all her copies
and wants us to make a sequel!

08:20.033 --> 08:23.571
That's like a prequel
but in the future.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.838
What do you say, sweetie?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.674
Do you have more sad in you?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.076
I've got scads of sad!

08:29.109 --> 08:32.079
* Oh, no, not again

08:32.112 --> 08:34.481
* There they go

08:34.514 --> 08:36.884
* With pad and pen

08:36.917 --> 08:40.253
* Collaboration

08:40.287 --> 08:44.091
* Ooh, collaboration

08:44.124 --> 08:46.093
*

08:46.126 --> 08:48.061
* Collaboration

08:48.095 --> 08:51.431
* Collaboration.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.768
Okay, now draw me
overhearing the other girls

08:54.802 --> 08:56.770
talking about how
they're not gonna invite me

08:56.804 --> 08:57.938
to a birthday party.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.072
Like this?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.741
LISA:
Fantastic!

09:00.774 --> 09:02.242
Now let's take a little break.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.111
And you know what that means.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.412
Hot Sharpie!

09:06.446 --> 09:07.414
Hot Sharpie!

09:07.447 --> 09:08.515
-Hot Sharpie!
-Hot Sharpie!

09:08.548 --> 09:09.717
-Hot Sharpie!
-Hot Sharpie! (grunts)

09:09.750 --> 09:11.084
(Lisa and Marge laugh)

09:11.118 --> 09:13.186
-You almost got me! -How come
we never bond like that?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.188
I don't know,
you never make the first move.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.423
Okay.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.092
There is something I've
always wanted to do with you.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.128
("The Andy Griffith Show" theme
playing)

09:24.064 --> 09:26.266
Hey, those guys stole
our fishing poles!

09:26.299 --> 09:28.101
And my skipping stones!

09:28.135 --> 09:29.536
(grunting)

09:29.569 --> 09:31.571
-(shouting)
-(theme continues)

09:34.307 --> 09:36.309
(raccoon trilling)

09:39.146 --> 09:41.114
(indistinct chatter)

09:48.255 --> 09:49.790
Welcome to "Chicks with Pix,"

09:49.823 --> 09:52.760
a panel discussion
with women writers and artists.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.261
I'm your moderator, Roz Chast.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.096
You may know
my New Yorker cartoons

09:56.129 --> 09:57.765
that are both funny ha-ha

09:57.798 --> 09:59.767
and funny aha.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.102
(laughter)

10:02.135 --> 10:03.136
Silence!

10:04.171 --> 10:06.306
Joining me today
are Alison Bechdel;

10:06.339 --> 10:08.141
Marjane Satrapi;

10:08.175 --> 10:10.744
and the creators of Sad Girl,
Lisa Simpson...

10:10.778 --> 10:12.112
(cheering and applause)

10:12.145 --> 10:14.948
We love you, Lisa!

10:14.982 --> 10:16.116
...and Marge Simpson.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.918
(scattered applause)

10:17.951 --> 10:20.754
FAN GIRL:
We're wasting time!

10:20.788 --> 10:22.656
Marjane, as the author
of Persepolis

10:22.690 --> 10:24.758
and someone who grew up
in a repressive regime,

10:24.792 --> 10:26.994
what advice would you offer
to young women?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.996
Always remember
nothing is more valuable

10:29.029 --> 10:30.831
than your own unique voice.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.667
Also, when they promise you
a tote bag for doing a panel,

10:33.701 --> 10:36.436
make sure it's not just
a reusable grocery bag.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.438
Look at this.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.107
Alison Bechdel, recently,

10:40.140 --> 10:43.176
a lot of people have been
talking about the Bechdel Test.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.679
Exactly what kind
of drinking game is that?

10:45.713 --> 10:47.848
Actually, it's just
an observation I made

10:47.881 --> 10:50.017
about how movies and TV
rarely show

10:50.050 --> 10:52.452
two women talking about
something other than a man.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.021
That's so interesting.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.189
I'll have to tell my husband
about that.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.991
(booing)

10:58.025 --> 10:59.459
(buzzer sounds)

10:59.492 --> 11:02.395
MAN (over speaker):
Bechdel Test: Fail!

11:02.429 --> 11:04.164
-* Bechdel, Bechdel
-(whistle blows)

11:04.197 --> 11:06.066
Bechdel, fail!

11:06.099 --> 11:07.467
Fail!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.469
-Fail.
-(whistle blows)

11:09.502 --> 11:11.238
Okay. We have five minutes

11:11.271 --> 11:13.006
before we have to clear
the room

11:13.040 --> 11:15.008
for the
"White Men in Comics" panel.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.810
I have a question for Lisa.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.546
I have a question for Lisa
with a follow-up for Lisa.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.749
I want to talk about myself
for a few minutes,

11:21.782 --> 11:24.384
then at the end, pretend it
was all a question for Lisa.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.987
Does anyone have any questions
for my mom?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.056
She does draw every panel.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.191
Yeah, I have a question
for Marge.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.160
How lucky are you
to work with Lisa?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.594
AUDIENCE (chanting):
Lisa!

11:34.627 --> 11:36.997
Lisa! Lisa!

11:37.030 --> 11:39.032
MAN:
Lisa win!

11:39.066 --> 11:41.401
Marge fail.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.772
(pencil scratching)

11:44.805 --> 11:46.673
Honey, I was thinking.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.576
What if we did a chapter
from the mom's point of view?

11:49.609 --> 11:52.212
I took a stab at writing it up.
Give it a read.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.546
In front of you?

11:53.580 --> 11:55.949
Um, okay.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.450
Mmm.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.252
(groans)

11:59.286 --> 12:01.054
(chuckles)

12:01.088 --> 12:02.890
What are you laughing at?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.524
You left out a word here,

12:04.557 --> 12:08.361
so it just says, "I lonely."

12:08.395 --> 12:10.597
So should I start drawing it?

12:10.630 --> 12:13.400
Well, there's a lot
of great stuff here.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.369
Really? Because that's
what I was going for.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.873
But I'm not sure this is
a Sad Girl thing.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.374
Maybe it's a separate book

12:21.408 --> 12:23.543
and I could write the forward.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.045
Oh, I get it.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.647
This isn't a real
collaboration at all.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.716
You agree with those girl
fanboys.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.919
You think it's all about you.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.553
Hey, you can't blame me

12:33.586 --> 12:36.156
if people want to focus on
my contribution.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.158
I can and I do.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.660
I hate to say it, Mom,

12:40.693 --> 12:43.130
but maybe we should
take a break.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.632
Good idea. Hot Sharpie.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.769
No. I mean, maybe we should take

12:49.803 --> 12:52.139
a real break.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.941
-You mean... ?
-That's right.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.944
I want to see other
illustrators.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.011
-(Homer grunts)
-(Marge growls)

12:58.045 --> 12:59.779
-I don't even know how you could
-Stupid Lisa.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.114
-say that. It's my vision.
-She's acting like a real B.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.783
Ladies, there's someone here
to see you.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.752
(slurping)

13:05.785 --> 13:07.754
My name is Guthrie Frenel,

13:07.787 --> 13:10.991
visionary theatrical director
and impish genius.

13:11.024 --> 13:14.194
And I want to make Sad Girl
into a smash Broadway show.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.963
(gasps)

13:15.996 --> 13:17.664
I think he came in
through the window.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.500
-(laughing): Oh, tubby, you're
a delight. -(Homer whimpers)

13:24.204 --> 13:25.839
You want to make Sad Girl
into a stage musical?

13:25.873 --> 13:29.009
If I may borrow a phrase
from my father, woo-hoo!

13:29.042 --> 13:30.878
This is all very exciting,

13:30.911 --> 13:32.045
but before we go any further--

13:32.079 --> 13:34.814
and I ask this just
for clarification--

13:34.848 --> 13:37.017
-what's your deal, weirdo?
-Dad.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.187
Guthrie Frenel is a visionary
director and an impish genius.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.289
He did a version of
Waiting for Godot

13:42.322 --> 13:45.658
-where Godot appears
in the first scene. -What?

13:45.692 --> 13:48.896
And that was nothing compared
to my vision for Sad Girl.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.964
I want to do something new
and amazing,

13:50.998 --> 13:53.200
like my all-dog version of Cats.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.968
But I need something from you.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.470
-Anything.
-I need your passion.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.906
I need your joy.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.975
Are we all together for this
three-person toboggan ride

14:02.009 --> 14:04.077
down Mount Collabor-manjaro?

14:04.111 --> 14:08.181
Well, Lisa and I did just have
a little spat.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.718
Yeah, but conflict is part of
the creative process, right?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.320
Not in my experience!

14:13.353 --> 14:15.388
So are you in?

14:15.422 --> 14:18.058
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.328
Oh, this is gonna take hours.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.197
(grunting)

14:24.231 --> 14:26.433
Bart, there's one thing I know
about Broadway shows,

14:26.466 --> 14:28.268
they always make money.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.703
So I'm already looking forward
to quitting my job.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.039
Can I quit school?

14:32.072 --> 14:35.075
I'd be a pretty lousy dad
if I said no.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.745
It's our duty as artists

14:38.778 --> 14:41.714
to rip up the contract between
audience and performers.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.750
Cell phones will be turned on.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.186
Candy will be unwrapped
during the show.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.188
We'll hire performance artists

14:48.221 --> 14:51.191
to make the line for the
ladies room extra long.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.193
(grunts)

14:53.226 --> 14:55.295
Um, how closely
are we gonna stick

14:55.328 --> 14:57.630
to the story
from my graphic novel?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.132
Oh, yes, story.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.201
All the gimmicky stagecraft
in the world

15:01.234 --> 15:02.869
ain't worth a tinker's damn

15:02.902 --> 15:05.638
without a compelling human story
at the center.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.540
Your story,
the unique expression

15:07.574 --> 15:09.376
-of your heart and soul...
-Mm-hmm.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.244
...will be neatly summed up

15:11.278 --> 15:13.780
-in the narrator's first speech.
-Huh?

15:13.813 --> 15:15.248
Once that's out of the way,

15:15.282 --> 15:17.117
we can explore the dazzling

15:17.150 --> 15:19.419
visual buffet of Marge Simpson.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.920
Now feast.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.155
(chomping)

15:22.189 --> 15:23.991
Pass the wonderment, please,

15:24.024 --> 15:26.626
but save room for the Tonys.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.961
Oh, my God.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.896
It's just how I drew it.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.565
It's your artistic vision
writ large.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.667
Or should I say, writ Marge?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.136
You should.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.304
He really shouldn't.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.140
*

15:40.173 --> 15:41.308
(gasps)

15:41.341 --> 15:43.676
MARGE:
It's all in my style.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.648
Mom, he's ignoring my story

15:48.681 --> 15:51.084
and making this all about
your drawings.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.086
I know.
(sighs)

15:53.120 --> 15:54.754
I'm sorry, Lisa.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.423
But I can't help it
if he wants to focus

15:56.456 --> 15:57.991
on the visual part of--

15:58.025 --> 16:01.861
(gasps) Oh, my God.
It's Bart and Grampa.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.796
But they aren't even in my book.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.965
And where am I?
Where is Sad Girl?

16:05.999 --> 16:08.301
Sad Girl will be represented

16:08.335 --> 16:10.603
by a voiceless red light
projected into

16:10.637 --> 16:13.106
an empty seat in the balcony.
Bold, no?

16:13.140 --> 16:15.675
But how will they know
it's supposed to be me?

16:15.708 --> 16:18.145
-Storytelling.
-(screaming)

16:19.046 --> 16:20.180
LISA:
Ugh.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.483
That impish genius is really
cheesing me off.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.386
All he's kept from Sad Girl
is Mom's drawings,

16:26.419 --> 16:29.989
when it's supposed to be about
my writing and my feelings.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.559
Oh, I'm so sick
of children's feelings.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.960
"Feed me." "Burp me."

16:33.993 --> 16:35.228
"Don't sleep for six years."

16:35.262 --> 16:37.497
You're forgetting the boundary

16:37.530 --> 16:39.299
between patient and therapist.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.069
And you're forgetting
that you did this to me!

16:44.003 --> 16:45.172
Let me tell you something, Lisa.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.074
When you give birth
to something,

16:47.107 --> 16:48.908
you have no control over
what it turns into.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.011
All you can do is surrender
to the nightmare.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.814
(laughing):
Sorry. I'm just so happy.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.849
(laughing, then crying)

16:59.952 --> 17:02.489
Never do this.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.057
MARGE:
Here they are.

17:04.091 --> 17:07.994
The official Sad Girl: The
Theater Experience T-shirts.

17:08.027 --> 17:12.565
$45 in the lobby,
of which we keep $1.35.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.502
Oh, baby, we can use that money
to buy a sailboat

17:15.535 --> 17:17.670
with a double-ended
spinnaker pole.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.739
-(whistles)
-Oh, ho-ho.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.674
Looks good. I like it.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.176
I like everything.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.079
Really? You seemed a little
cheesed off earlier.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.547
A mother notices.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.350
Mom, Sad Girl was like our baby.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.353
And you can't control
what your kid turns into.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.288
If it becomes a successful show,

17:35.322 --> 17:37.056
that'll be good for our family.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.558
Now if you'll excuse me,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.427
I'm gonna go
sit on a swing alone.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.295
-Oh, okay.
-(door closes)

17:42.329 --> 17:44.030
Hello, Coast Guard?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.134
Get ready to search for my body
in about a month.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.735
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.069
(gasps) Oh.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.704
(indistinct chatter)

17:51.738 --> 17:53.206
(instruments warming up)

17:53.240 --> 17:56.143
-So you're okay with this?
-Sure.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.645
It's an honor to have something
based on your life.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.980
Even if it's nothing like
your life at all.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.982
*

18:04.117 --> 18:06.486
* Sad Girl

18:06.519 --> 18:09.055
(woman screams)

18:09.088 --> 18:11.090
*

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
What the hell does
any of this mean?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.306
What? You don't get this?

18:26.339 --> 18:29.075
It's so stimulating
and I love it.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.977
(screams)

18:31.010 --> 18:33.280
-What is that?!
-(growling): D'oh!

18:33.313 --> 18:35.315
*

18:40.387 --> 18:42.389
(cheering)

18:48.828 --> 18:50.830
*

18:53.666 --> 18:57.170
Uh, Guthrie, is it possible
we strayed

18:57.204 --> 19:00.173
a skoosh too far from what
Lisa's book is about?

19:00.207 --> 19:03.276
Marge, this isn't You're A Good
Man, Charlie Brown.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.012
Or even my production of You're
A Good Man, Charlie Brown,

19:06.045 --> 19:08.047
set in a doomed
Soviet submarine.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.451
This is avant-garde theater,
and it is electric.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.520
(mimics electricity zapping)

19:13.553 --> 19:17.156
Okay, I guess.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.192
*

19:25.532 --> 19:27.334
Oh, Lisa.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.069
I'm so sorry. Hmm.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.971
(grunts)

19:32.004 --> 19:34.707
There, honey. Now you're
back in our show.

19:37.076 --> 19:40.480
What the... ? That's not one of
my brain babies.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.081
(light squeaking)

19:42.114 --> 19:43.850
Ah! Ow.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.354
(alarmed chatter)

19:49.121 --> 19:50.122
Ah!

19:51.591 --> 19:54.961
Which one of us
is me?

19:56.529 --> 19:57.897
(alarmed cries)

19:57.930 --> 19:59.532
-(explosion)
-(screaming)

20:02.602 --> 20:04.937
Run for your cultural lives!

20:04.971 --> 20:08.408
I'm haunted my visions
of Milhouse.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.042
Ah!

20:10.076 --> 20:12.078
(indistinct chatter)

20:15.147 --> 20:18.184
(marker squeaking)

20:18.217 --> 20:20.953
(slurping)
And now to read the reviews.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.189
"Greatest..."
I like where this is going.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.525
"...disaster in theater
history."

20:25.558 --> 20:28.695
Oh, those sons of Bs.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.064
Honey, I'm sorry
I let Guthrie make the play

20:32.098 --> 20:35.302
all about my drawings,
and also terrible.

20:35.335 --> 20:39.038
And I'm sorry I wasn't more open
to your creative input.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.207
I blame both of you
for this disaster.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.275
More wine!

20:42.309 --> 20:43.743
I've got another project

20:43.776 --> 20:45.278
for us to collaborate on.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.280
Getting your dad
in a cab.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.417
Hello, Coast Guard?
I'm gonna live.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.162

21:12.939 --> 21:14.907
(saxophone solo playing)

21:14.941 --> 21:16.943

21:21.548 --> 21:23.883
Well, I still think it's good.
