[web shooter deploys]

00:10.291 --> 00:12.291
[sighs]

00:12.291 --> 00:16.375
Well, now I've got two heroes
who actually believe
I'm innocent.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.625
Now I just need to convince...

00:20.125 --> 00:22.166
everyone else in New York.
[sighs]

00:22.166 --> 00:24.166
I wouldn't count on that.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.250
I'm not that gullible.

00:26.250 --> 00:29.959
Surrender now, Ghost Spider.
I know you must
be tired of running.

00:29.959 --> 00:32.750
Patriot, you're back!

00:32.750 --> 00:35.166
That's so... tenacious.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.333
Hang on just one second.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.333
What?

00:38.333 --> 00:40.166
Hey!

00:50.041 --> 00:52.208
[grunts]
[grunts]

00:52.208 --> 00:54.125
Don't you ever give up?

00:54.125 --> 00:57.166
What can I say?
I'm so... tenacious.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.875
[both grunt]

00:58.875 --> 01:00.291
[grunts]

01:01.291 --> 01:04.083
[grunts, growls]

01:04.083 --> 01:05.583
[bones cracking]

01:05.583 --> 01:07.792
[sighs]
Isn't there a Miss Patriot

01:07.792 --> 01:09.792
or something that
you'd rather be with?

01:09.792 --> 01:12.375
I'm sure there's, like,
a malt shop somewhere
in Williamsburg.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.959
Come on, Ghost Spider.
[cracks knuckles]

01:14.959 --> 01:16.750
You know you're
the only girl for me.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.291
Do I need to give
the speech again?

01:18.291 --> 01:20.709
Let's just assume
I'm unconvinced.

01:20.709 --> 01:22.583
[yells]

01:22.583 --> 01:24.542
[both grunting]

01:24.542 --> 01:27.375
Keep dodging.
I can do this all day.
[grunts]

01:27.375 --> 01:31.667
[grunting]
Let's test that theory.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.959
Oh, come on, Patriot.
Huh?

01:38.083 --> 01:40.208
[crying out]

01:40.208 --> 01:42.917
Not many people can stand up
to my quake blasts.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.166
You're under arrest.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.291
Teamwork, Ghost Spider--

01:46.291 --> 01:48.500
always the villain's downfall.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.792
Like this night
keeps reminding me.

01:51.792 --> 01:55.125
Okay, I know you think
I'm responsible
for Kevin's death,

01:55.125 --> 01:56.625
but it was
an Inhuman woman.

01:56.625 --> 01:59.208
She had life-sucking knives.
I swear.

01:59.208 --> 02:02.125
What did you say?
Don't listen to her, Daisy.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.208
Everyone's innocent
once they're in handcuffs.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.458
What's he doing here?

02:21.458 --> 02:26.250
You're at the top
of Captain Stacy's
most-wanted list.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.625
He's here
to cross you off himself.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.208
If you take me around the back,
I promise I will answer

02:31.208 --> 02:34.125
the first three questions
you ask, no trouble.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.291
I'm serious, okay? I--
I'll take it from here.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.917
Ghost Spider. Huh.

02:40.917 --> 02:45.500
I don't normally take time
out of my day to see
a lowlife brought in.

02:45.500 --> 02:50.125
But I want you to know
that after what you did
to my daughter and her friend,

02:50.125 --> 02:53.667
I intend to you lock you
in the deepest,
darkest hole I have

02:53.667 --> 02:56.458
and throw away the key.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.542
Now let's see
who you really are.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.125
[grunts]
[grunts]

03:01.125 --> 03:02.542
[both grunt]

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
[grunts]
Get her!

03:07.000 --> 03:09.458
I'm on it.

03:09.458 --> 03:11.041
Huh?

03:11.041 --> 03:14.041
[growls]
Don't bother. She's gone.

03:14.041 --> 03:16.458
Are you kidding?
She was right here,

03:16.458 --> 03:20.375
and a piece of faulty tech
let her escape?!

03:20.375 --> 03:25.000
I wanna talk
to your commanding officer, now!

03:31.250 --> 03:33.667
[gasps]
Hey.
I don't normally pry,

03:33.667 --> 03:36.458
but why did you let me go,
Agent Johnson?

03:36.458 --> 03:40.834
Techs say a bolt shook loose.
I had nothing to do with it.

03:40.834 --> 03:45.166
Besides, if you can't trust
Captain Stacy's own daughter
to tell the truth,

03:45.166 --> 03:47.250
who can you trust?

03:48.250 --> 03:50.291
How'd you know it was me?

03:50.291 --> 03:51.834
A hunch.

03:51.834 --> 03:54.333
I saw how you clammed up
when he talked to you.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.834
Only a dad's disappointment
hurts like that.

03:56.834 --> 03:59.417
Plus, the knife woman
you mentioned rang a bell.

03:59.417 --> 04:02.375
These are from a side project
of mine. I-- I think
she might be in Boston.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.667
I-- Wow. I don't know
how to thank you.

04:05.667 --> 04:09.166
Simple.
Tell me everything you know
about her and her accomplices,

04:09.166 --> 04:10.750
especially any teleporters.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.083
I think something bigger
is going on here.
