00:29.040 --> 00:32.640
Well, friends come
and friends go.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.160
And I'm sorry to say

00:34.160 --> 00:39.160
that 2 of our good friends
have gone.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.160
David and Kristen's
families have moved.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.280
We won't be hearing
their stories anymore,

00:44.280 --> 00:47.320
but they'll always be
a part of the Midnight Society.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.960
We'll miss them.

00:49.960 --> 00:50.960
But...

00:50.960 --> 00:53.640
That means
that we have room

00:53.640 --> 00:56.240
for 2 new members.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.240
Betty Ann?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.160
My friend Sam
wants to join,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.800
but needs time to work
on an initiation story.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.600
Well, that's cool.
No rush.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.080
I've got someone
I want to sponsor,

01:06.080 --> 01:07.080
and I brought him
here tonight.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.160
He's ready.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.840
So bring him on.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.560
Kinda small, isn't he?

01:21.560 --> 01:24.360
Small?
I'll show you small!

01:24.360 --> 01:25.960
Oh, man,
not a chance.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.080
No way.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.160
Come on, man,
not your little brother!

01:28.160 --> 01:29.640
I've got no choice.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.080
I've either gotta
bring him,

01:31.080 --> 01:32.280
or I can't
come anymore.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
You're kidding.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.600
Hey, we're not
baby sitters.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.880
You know, members
gotta tell stories.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.600
If you scabs
would lighten up,

01:37.600 --> 01:39.600
maybe I could
tell one.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.440
Listen,
give him a chance.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.240
You'd really
have to quit?

01:48.880 --> 01:50.480
Yeah, yeah,
I know.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.600
Tucker,
this better be good,

01:56.600 --> 01:59.400
or I'm gonna let
Frank pound you.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.800
Tucker: OK.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.520
You guys make up ghost
stories all the time.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.040
But, there are
some ghost stories

02:06.040 --> 02:08.919
that have been
around for so long,

02:08.919 --> 02:12.680
that it makes you wonder
if maybe, just maybe,

02:12.680 --> 02:14.640
they might
not be made up.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.240
My story's about
a famous ghost,

02:20.240 --> 02:22.640
and about a legend
that's so popular

02:22.640 --> 02:25.560
it just won't die.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.520
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:30.520 --> 02:33.920
I call this story...

02:42.120 --> 02:43.520
<i>Tucker: They called him</i>

02:43.520 --> 02:45.520
<i> the Headless Horseman.</i>

02:45.520 --> 02:47.520
<i> Legend says he was a soldier</i>

02:47.520 --> 02:49.520
<i> who had his head ripped off</i>

02:49.520 --> 02:51.160
<i> by a stray cannonball.</i>

02:51.160 --> 02:52.520
<i> Night after night,</i>

02:52.520 --> 02:54.480
<i> his ghost would
ride through the countryside</i>

02:54.480 --> 02:57.520
<i> near Sleepy Hollow
searching for a new head</i>

02:57.520 --> 02:59.760
<i> and a victim
to steal it from.</i>

02:59.760 --> 03:02.480
<i> Then, one Halloween night,</i>

03:02.480 --> 03:05.200
<i> a lonely schoolmaster
named Ichabod Crane</i>

03:05.200 --> 03:06.920
<i> took a wrong turn
in the woods</i>

03:06.920 --> 03:08.480
<i> and was chased down
by the demon ghost.</i>

03:08.480 --> 03:10.480
[Horse whinnying]

03:10.480 --> 03:11.960
<i> Ichabod rode like crazy</i>

03:11.960 --> 03:13.920
<i> to get to
the Bridge of Souls,</i>

03:13.920 --> 03:16.720
<i> a bridge the Headless
Horseman could never cross.</i>

03:16.720 --> 03:18.480
<i> But he didn't make it,</i>

03:18.480 --> 03:21.960
<i> and poor Ichabod
was never seen again.</i>

03:21.960 --> 03:25.360
<i> Ever since then,
on Halloween night,</i>

03:25.360 --> 03:26.960
<i> the ghosts of
the Headless Horseman</i>

03:26.960 --> 03:28.960
<i> and Ichabod Crane
return to Sleepy Hollow</i>

03:28.960 --> 03:31.480
<i> to ride again.</i>

03:31.480 --> 03:33.680
<i> Or so the legend says.</i>

03:42.560 --> 03:45.480
<i> Ian Matthews
just moved to Sleepy Hollow</i>

03:45.480 --> 03:47.520
<i> and was trying hard
to make friends.</i>

03:47.520 --> 03:49.480
<i> But like everything
Ian did,</i>

03:49.480 --> 03:51.840
<i> sometimes he tried
a little too hard.</i>

03:53.040 --> 03:54.480
Heads up!

03:54.480 --> 03:55.680
Brad!

03:55.680 --> 03:57.880
I'm sorry, babe.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.120
Um--um,
please allow me.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.360
Oh, thanks.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.680
He really
burns me sometimes.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.560
Hi, um--I'm Ian.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.920
I'm Katie.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.920
Um--aren't we in
the same lit class?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.160
I sit by the...

04:17.160 --> 04:18.720
Window!
Uh--yeah, we are.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.280
What is all this stuff?

04:22.280 --> 04:27.000
Oh, it's decorations for
the Halloween dance tonight.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.400
Uh--tonight?

04:28.400 --> 04:31.280
Hey, I'm available
if you need any help.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.560
Really?
That would be great.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.800
I could use all the...

04:34.800 --> 04:36.240
Oh, look what he did.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.760
I was gonna help.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.920
If you want to help, you
can get this fixed pronto.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.920
And bring it inside,
because we'll be

04:41.920 --> 04:43.080
setting up
for the dance.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.160
Lead on.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.440
Hey, is he putting
moves on Katie?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.440
Not if he wants to live.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.200
So, how do you like
Sleepy Hollow?

05:15.520 --> 05:16.880
It's nice.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.920
But you know, kind of
boring compared to the city,

05:19.920 --> 05:20.920
but it--it's nice.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.120
You're from
the city?

05:22.120 --> 05:23.320
Yeah, I just
moved in this summer.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.880
Need some help, babe?

05:24.880 --> 05:26.360
<i>No thanks, babe.</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:28.840
We're almost done.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.520
So are you going to
the dance with me tonight?

05:31.520 --> 05:34.520
Brad! How many ways
do I have to say it?!

05:34.520 --> 05:35.520
It's over.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.360
We don't
go out anymore.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.880
Look, I'll say when
we don't go out anymore.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.360
Good thing you've
got such a hard head.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.720
Sorry about that.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.680
So are you going
to the dance tonight?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.680
Why, are you asking?
Ha ha.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.240
You stay away
from her,

05:53.240 --> 05:56.320
unless you want to
walk around toothless.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.400
I don't believe it.
I'm sorry.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.800
He can be really
juvenile sometimes.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.480
He can be
really scary, too.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.800
Don't let him
bother you.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.360
Are you coming
tonight?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.800
Wouldn't miss it.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.800
Great.
Save a dance for me.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.000
Well, this is
gonna be interesting.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.520
[Dance music]

07:10.320 --> 07:11.760
Hey, we're twins.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.280
Great minds
think alike.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.720
Hey, I love bumping
into old friends.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.240
Come on.
You owe me a dance.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.680
A debt I'd be most
happy to pay, my lady.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.400
<i>Tucker: Ian was
kind of a goofy guy,</i>

07:38.400 --> 07:40.720
<i> and everybody thought
he was pretty funny.</i>

07:40.720 --> 07:42.880
<i> Well, almost everybody.</i>

07:44.800 --> 07:46.280
<i> Ian didn't know it,</i>

07:46.280 --> 07:50.000
<i> but he was walking through
some very dangerous territory.</i>

07:50.000 --> 07:51.040
Thanks.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.680
Would you just listen
to me for a second?

08:05.680 --> 08:06.920
Hey, guys,
how are you doing?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.440
Take off, geek.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.480
Listen...

08:09.480 --> 08:10.680
Call me crazy,
but I don't think

08:10.680 --> 08:11.960
she wants to
talk to you.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.480
It's OK, Ian...

08:13.480 --> 08:14.600
Excuse me?

08:14.600 --> 08:16.680
I think you should
leave her alone.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.400
Oh.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.240
Brad!

08:23.760 --> 08:24.680
All right.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.760
You, outside.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.480
Brad,
don't do this.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.760
Put your fists down,
geek.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.600
Uh--I'd rather not.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.159
Look, I don't want
to fight you.

08:40.159 --> 08:41.720
I'm gonna
do you a favor.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.080
Uh--good,
I think.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.480
Brad, cut the macho stuff.
It's old.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.440
You know the Legend
of Sleepy Hollow?

08:50.440 --> 08:52.440
Uh--yeah, sorta.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.520
Well, let me
refresh your memory.

08:54.520 --> 09:00.680
It was Halloween night
back in 1700 whatever,

09:00.680 --> 09:03.960
when Ichabod Crane
came to a fork in the road.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.080
He should have gone left,

09:06.080 --> 09:07.520
but he went right.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.080
So, instead of getting
to the Bridge of Souls,

09:12.080 --> 09:15.080
a bridge the Headless Horseman
could never cross over,

09:15.080 --> 09:18.160
he went deeper into the woods.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.680
Yeah, I know,

09:19.680 --> 09:20.840
the Headless Horseman
threw a pumpkin

09:20.840 --> 09:24.120
and took his head.
So what?

09:24.120 --> 09:26.240
So, it's Halloween,

09:26.240 --> 09:29.600
and we have a tradition
here in Sleepy Hollow.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.120
When some
new guy shows up,

09:31.120 --> 09:33.120
he's gotta
be initiated.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.120
Oh, please.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.960
Whaddya gonna
take my head?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.600
Not exactly.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.360
No.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.600
See, the old bridge
is still there,

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
just like in the story.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.120
It's through the park
and into the woods.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.120
Yeah, so?

09:48.120 --> 09:50.120
So what
you gotta do

09:50.120 --> 09:52.120
is go to the bridge,

09:52.120 --> 09:53.880
get the Headless
Horseman's pumpkin,

09:53.880 --> 09:57.080
just like
we all did.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.120
Come on, Ian,
you don't have to.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.640
You're kidding,
right?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.680
You got a choice.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.240
Go get the pumpkin,

10:04.240 --> 10:06.600
we'll cut
you some slack.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.080
don't get it,

10:08.080 --> 10:09.960
and you can put
your fists back up.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.600
Well, uh--since I don't
believe in ghosts,

10:14.600 --> 10:17.040
I'll uh--take my chance
with the pumpkin.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.680
Have fun.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.120
Look, this isn't
a tradition.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.640
You don't
have to do this.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.120
It's OK. I'll
play a little game,

10:29.120 --> 10:30.600
get it over with.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.000
Save a dance for me.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.960
[Ian whistling]

11:12.800 --> 11:14.280
Fork in the road.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.720
OK, Ichabod,
which way to the bridge?

11:22.920 --> 11:25.840
You went right.
I'm going left.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.480
[Sound of horse whinnying]

11:34.520 --> 11:37.480
[Sound of horse whinnying]

11:55.600 --> 11:58.400
OK, guys,
where's the pumpkin?

12:14.000 --> 12:14.960
Nice touch.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.600
[Crackling sound]

12:20.080 --> 12:23.000
[Male voice in the distance]

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Yeah, ha ha, Brad.
I know it's you.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.600
[Sound of
footsteps running]

12:32.040 --> 12:33.840
Gimme a break!

12:35.760 --> 12:37.200
You guys aren't...

12:37.200 --> 12:38.400
Oh!

12:40.800 --> 12:42.560
No, no!

12:46.040 --> 12:47.040
No.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.800
No, don't take
my head!

12:48.800 --> 12:49.520
No!

12:50.560 --> 12:51.680
Boo!

12:53.200 --> 12:56.240
Oh, man, this is gonna
go down in history.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.440
Help! Help!
Don't take my head!

12:58.440 --> 12:59.880
Ian,
are you OK?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.480
Don't mess with me,
you little weasel.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.480
I'll take
your head off myself.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.400
Let's go, Katie.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.080
I'm staying with Ian.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.880
Would you forget
this loser?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.840
Brad, I'm sick of
your stupid games!

13:18.840 --> 13:21.440
Why don't you just take
your traveling circus, please,

13:21.440 --> 13:23.800
and leave me alone?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.920
Do whatever you want.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.920
Just remember,
it's Halloween.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.440
I don't think
your pal here

13:29.440 --> 13:31.440
has the guts to stand up to
the real Headless Horseman

13:31.440 --> 13:33.000
if he shows up.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.440
Ian, I'm really sorry.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.920
No, no. Hey, I
like ridicule.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.640
I can't wait
for school on Monday

13:44.640 --> 13:46.320
because I'm gonna
get tons.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.320
Listen,
would you walk me home?

13:50.320 --> 13:53.440
'Tis the one thing
that would make

13:53.440 --> 13:55.600
this horrible night
worthwhile, my lady.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.640
Take thee
my muddy arm.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.320
I am really glad
this night is over.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.840
I think
you're really great.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.640
You know, Brad never would
have come out here by himself.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.840
Hey, you're shivering.
Take my jacket.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.400
No, I'm OK.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.240
[Horse sounds]

14:52.880 --> 14:54.320
It was brave
how you stood up

14:54.320 --> 14:55.720
to Brad at
the dance, too.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.320
Yeah, right.
Brave and stupid.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.320
No, it's about time
someone stood up to...

14:59.320 --> 15:00.320
[Horse whinnying]

15:00.320 --> 15:01.880
You hear that?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.880
It's a horse.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.000
Does Brad ride?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.720
I don't think so.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.880
I uh--
think we'd better--ah!

15:15.880 --> 15:17.160
Good evening,
children.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.800
Oh, I didn't mean
to startle you.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.400
I'm afraid
I've lost my way

15:22.400 --> 15:24.280
in these
wretched woods.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.760
Would you be so kind

15:25.760 --> 15:27.120
as to direct me to
the Bridge of Souls?

15:27.120 --> 15:31.760
Uh--yeah, sure.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.120
Uh--take a left
at the fork.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.960
Oh, lucky thing.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.200
I surely would
have taken a right.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.720
Thank you kindly.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.280
Who are you?

15:45.280 --> 15:47.880
Crane, Ichabod Crane,
the new schoolmaster.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.480
Good evening.

15:50.840 --> 15:51.760
Ichabod Crane?

15:51.760 --> 15:53.880
You gotta be...

15:55.840 --> 15:57.880
Where'd he go?

15:57.880 --> 16:00.920
Let's get you home.
Let's...

16:09.320 --> 16:11.280
Ian, I'm really
glad I met you.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.280
Me, too.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.280
I--I mean,
I'm glad I met you.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.760
Uh--at the risk
of needing dental work,

16:20.760 --> 16:23.840
I--uh--I'd like
to see you again.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.920
Me, too.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.960
I mean, I'd like
to see you again.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.720
[Dog barks]

16:33.720 --> 16:35.200
I just remembered my bike.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.840
Um--I left it
at the school.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.720
Good night.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.760
Good night.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.640
[Sound of horse whinnying]

16:50.760 --> 16:52.560
You're spooking yourself,
Ian, old boy.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.520
[Laughter]

17:18.280 --> 17:19.200
[Horse whinnying]

17:19.200 --> 17:20.640
Aw, come on.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.119
Brad?

17:23.880 --> 17:25.760
Brad, I'm not
buying it.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.440
[Sound of horse gallop]

17:29.720 --> 17:31.600
Man, this guy is good.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.640
Oh, no, the key,
I forgot it in my jacket.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.200
[Laughter from a distance]

17:38.720 --> 17:40.160
Forget it.
I'm outta here.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.160
Ah!

17:41.160 --> 17:42.640
It's just me.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.160
What are
you doing here?

17:44.160 --> 17:47.640
Thanks, but I could have
gotten it tomorrow.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.520
Oh.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.960
Come on,
I'll ride you home.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.640
Relax. Why are
you so nervous?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.640
You know,
Brad, the bridge.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.640
You know, that real wacky
guy in that costume.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.960
Let's just pretend none
of this ever happened.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.040
Ian?

18:08.120 --> 18:09.200
[Laughter]

18:11.200 --> 18:12.880
That's it.
I've had it.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.160
Enough's enough,
Brad, all right?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.640
She doesn't
like you anymore!

18:19.640 --> 18:21.560
You want to fight,
we'll fight.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.640
But stop with
the stupid games.

18:34.000 --> 18:34.920
Say what?

18:34.920 --> 18:36.720
[Laughter]

18:42.880 --> 18:44.720
[Horse whinnies]

18:45.200 --> 18:46.680
Brad?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.400
Run for your life!

18:56.400 --> 18:57.640
What is this?
What's the matter?

18:57.640 --> 18:58.800
<i> The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow</i>

18:58.800 --> 19:00.360
just stopped being
a legend. Look.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.520
Aaaahhhh!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.560
Meet your brother, pal!

19:12.320 --> 19:13.720
Don't take my head!

19:19.720 --> 19:21.080
This can't be,
can it?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.920
Katie, the thing
came out of the wall.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.400
This is no joke. It's
the Headless Horseman.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.600
I thought he's supposed
to be after Ichabod Crane.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.080
Yeah, except we told old Ichabod
how to get to the bridge.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.600
We changed
the story.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.240
No, it's after us.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.080
There's only
one thing we can do.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.120
What?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.600
We've got to
play the story out.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.600
We've got to get to the
bridge. He can't cross it.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.080
If you think
I'm going...

19:41.080 --> 19:42.160
Aaahhh!

19:43.840 --> 19:45.520
Ha ha ha ha!

19:48.640 --> 19:50.080
I think we lost him.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.080
He'd never think we'd be
stupid enough to come back here.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.640
Go!

20:02.160 --> 20:03.400
Faster!

20:06.320 --> 20:07.720
Stop!
Turn right!

20:13.640 --> 20:14.960
There!

20:23.080 --> 20:24.040
Now what?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.520
He can't get
both of us.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.040
I'll distract him.
You run for the bridge.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
He'll get you!

20:28.040 --> 20:30.040
Have you got
a better idea?

20:30.040 --> 20:31.520
Yeah,
I'll distract him.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.600
No!

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600
Ian, go!

20:50.000 --> 20:50.240
Aaahhh!

20:53.600 --> 20:55.680
[Katie screaming]

20:55.680 --> 20:56.720
Aaaahhh!

20:56.720 --> 20:58.240
You supernatural air head.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.320
It's me you're after.
Come on.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.480
Come and get me!

21:03.040 --> 21:07.120
I hope this legend
works both ways.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.840
Guess not.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.880
The bridge!

21:11.680 --> 21:12.960
Run!

21:44.800 --> 21:46.480
Ian!

21:46.480 --> 21:47.640
Ian!

21:54.520 --> 21:57.000
And I thought
this place was boring.

21:59.040 --> 21:59.960
It worked.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.800
We set the
story straight.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.000
Wonderful.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.760
You children should
not be out so late.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.880
And on Halloween
to boot.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.040
They say these woods
are haunted, you know.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.000
Why are
you coming back?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.960
Oh, I'm afraid
I've totally lost my way.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.960
I think it best
to go back to the fork

22:19.960 --> 22:21.560
and take the right path.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.320
That should
set things straight.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.280
Uh--yeah, I think
it probably will.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.360
Take care.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.960
Beware of
the Headless Horseman.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.920
Happy Halloween.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.240
[Horseman laughing]

22:59.960 --> 23:01.480
The end.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.880
Well?

23:09.480 --> 23:10.720
You'll do.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
Excellent.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.120
Just keep him
out of my face.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.320
Yes!

23:24.320 --> 23:25.360
Nice going, bro.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.680
Welcome to
the Midnight Society.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.320
You put out the fire.
I'm gonna catch up.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.400
Uh...

23:34.200 --> 23:35.720
I hope I'm not
gonna regret this.
