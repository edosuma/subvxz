00:06.012 --> 00:07.311
Previously, on Shadowhunters...

00:07.346 --> 00:08.511
He's a Daylighter.

00:08.545 --> 00:10.252
You're proof that
the legends are true.

00:10.282 --> 00:12.757
We're here for you,
whatever you need, Daylighter.

00:13.618 --> 00:15.743
Keep quiet or I'll have
to punish you again.

00:17.356 --> 00:20.224
The kiss that will set them free
is the kiss you most desire.

00:20.818 --> 00:22.017
This means nothing.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.230
Can I have a pint of
O-Neg, please?

00:53.256 --> 00:54.961
- To go.
- You got it.

00:55.008 --> 00:57.021
It's on me, Daylighter.

00:57.051 --> 00:59.889
Quinn. Thanks, but it's all good.
I got it.

01:00.514 --> 01:02.562
- Please.
- OK.

01:02.576 --> 01:05.275
For a Daylighter,
you're looking a little pale. You okay?

01:06.320 --> 01:07.758
- I've had better days.
- How's that?

01:07.781 --> 01:09.748
You're living the life
we all wanna live.

01:10.624 --> 01:13.658
You don't want to be in my shoes.
Trust me.

01:13.694 --> 01:16.394
Day or night,
your heart can still get...

01:16.463 --> 01:17.529
shattered.

01:19.852 --> 01:22.553
Hey, make it two plasmas.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.716
- Plasma?
- The hard stuff.

01:33.673 --> 01:36.163
Your lucky night.
Just enough for two.

01:39.519 --> 01:42.454
Don't worry,
it'll make you forget your sorrow.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.125
L'Chaim.

01:54.334 --> 01:55.151
Whoa.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.491
This is strong. Real strong.

01:58.245 --> 02:00.812
- Do you have any more of this?
- Sorry.

02:01.535 --> 02:02.734

02:34.888 --> 02:36.275

02:36.350 --> 02:38.216
It's a Bleeder Den.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.825
So these people...
they're just letting themselves...

02:40.861 --> 02:42.961
- Be bitten.
- They're mundanes

02:42.996 --> 02:44.956
- that actually know that Vampires exist?
- A few.

02:44.994 --> 02:48.533
They crave vampire venom
more than we crave blood.

02:48.561 --> 02:50.695
Whoa.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.804
Isn't this all
against the Accords?

02:52.839 --> 02:53.806
It's kind of a grey area.
Everyone's.

02:53.820 --> 02:56.646
Everyone's having fun and
no one is getting hurt.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.876
Huh.

03:04.164 --> 03:06.531
Heidi. This is Simon.

03:11.599 --> 03:13.925
Thirsty?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.038
I don't know.
The last time I tried

03:16.062 --> 03:17.582
to feed on a human,
I couldn't stop.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.564
- I almost killed...
- It's OK.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.999
It's OK.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.968
Just a little taste.

Magnus?

04:51.691 --> 04:54.826
Mama?

04:56.730 --> 04:57.929
Mama?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.836
No!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.006
There you are.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.576
Good morning.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.846
I'd say the same,
but looks like you haven't slept.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.714
Should I be insulted by that?

05:17.161 --> 05:18.481
No...

05:18.752 --> 05:21.019
I love that face.
But this is like

05:21.054 --> 05:23.788
the fourth morning in a row that
I've woken up to an empty bed.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.724
Is there something
bothering you?

05:27.794 --> 05:29.928
Nothing is bothering me.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.630
I've even gotten used to
your adorable little snores.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.899
Hey, I don't snore.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.869
Look, I know you well enough
to know something's going on.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.905
Alexander, I'm fine.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.510
So what about you?
Have you decided

05:46.590 --> 05:49.848
what you're going to
report to the Clave?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.357
I'm torn.
If I don't tell the Clave

05:52.437 --> 05:54.552
about Luke's attempt
on Valentine's life,

05:54.588 --> 05:56.888
I'm in violation.
If they find out,

05:56.923 --> 05:59.524
I could be de-runed.

06:00.241 --> 06:02.274
Whatever you decide,

06:02.662 --> 06:04.796
I'll stand by you.

06:04.831 --> 06:07.665
Are you sure you're okay?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.901
Positive.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.006
That manipulative little wench.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.808
I hate the Seelie Queen.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.921
Look, I'm not a huge fan either.
But like her or not,

06:18.945 --> 06:20.912
Seelie magic doesn't lie.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.981
What happened at the Seelie
Court, it was real.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.065
I felt it. I know Clary did too.

06:25.105 --> 06:26.271
Whoa, slow down.

06:26.298 --> 06:28.786
Izzy,
I can't just erase my feelings.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.923
Do Clary and Simon a favor.
Don't go there, Jace.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.566
I've requested that we
move Valentine to the Gard

06:41.601 --> 06:42.912
in Idris. The Clave has
approved the transfer.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.680
You told them about the
assassination attempt?

06:44.704 --> 06:47.916
No. I explained to them
that moving Valentine

06:47.956 --> 06:49.986
out of the city is the best
way to restore relations

06:50.010 --> 06:52.744
with the Downworld.
I left Luke out of it.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.812
It is the right decision.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.915
But we have not given up
on finding who orchestrated

06:56.950 --> 06:59.303
- the hit on Valentine.
- I actually have a few leads on that.

06:59.327 --> 07:01.040
I'll get a report
in by end of day.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.988
Great. Izzy, you'll be
leading the transfer mission.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.791
Jace, you will assist.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.236
We need to remove
Valentine's Circle Rune.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.359
The new wards in Idris won't
let him pass with it on.

07:11.383 --> 07:14.599
- Jace, do you want the honors?
- Thought you'd never ask.

07:17.784 --> 07:20.685
Tell me that I'm making the right call.
'Cause between you and me,

07:21.247 --> 07:23.847
- I'm just not sure I'm good at this.
- What're you talking about?

07:23.877 --> 07:26.678
You were born for this job.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.547
Think of it like archery.

07:29.583 --> 07:33.017
Just trust yourself.
Don't hesitate.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.820
And beyond that,
just cross your fingers.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.493
Simon, please call me back.

07:42.529 --> 07:45.630
I need to talk to you.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.967
Come in.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.674
We're transferring
Valentine to Idris tonight.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.710
I assume you want to
be part of the mission.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.547
Actually, I don't.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.516
I have to go sort all
this out with Simon.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.852
In person.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.569
I know it's none of my
business, but

08:11.575 --> 08:13.663
after what you guys
just went through,

08:13.727 --> 08:15.247
maybe you should
give Simon some time.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.962
No. No, I can't let him think

08:17.998 --> 08:20.358
that what happened at the Seelie
Court is how I really feel.

08:21.269 --> 08:24.802
Clary, Seelie magic might trick
you, but it's always true.

08:27.234 --> 08:29.200
I know it's confusing.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.677
But you can have feelings for
two people at the same time.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.947
It doesn't make
you a bad person.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.690
Simon, it's me.

08:50.897 --> 08:54.732
If you're not gonna answer my phone
calls, you can at least talk to me.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.657
I am so sorry.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.829
I want you to know that...

09:24.864 --> 09:27.598
what happened at
the Seelie Court...

09:28.968 --> 09:31.836
- It didn't mean anything.
- You don't need to do this.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.805
Your life was at risk.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.008
I had to kiss Jace.
I had no choice.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.610
I get it, Clary. I was there.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.781
This isn't about
you kissing him.

09:45.192 --> 09:48.986
The Seelie Queen made you reveal who
you desired most. And it wasn't me.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.922
It was Jace.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.826
It's a trick. That's all it was.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.828
- Just be honest with me...
- I am.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.832
You heard Jace, the Seelies thrive
on getting inside your head...

10:00.867 --> 10:02.767
Clary, stop.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.211
Don't make this
harder than it already

10:04.217 --> 10:05.842
'cause you don't wanna
hurt my feelings.

10:06.610 --> 10:10.775
What do you want me to do, Simon?
Just tell me.

10:12.062 --> 10:16.581
Look me in the eye and tell me you
don't have any feelings for him.

10:22.108 --> 10:25.957
Simon. Simon wait, please.
Look at me.

10:26.946 --> 10:30.781
- I love you.
- Don't... don't do that.

10:30.830 --> 10:31.380
Why...

10:31.386 --> 10:33.106
Because you don't mean
it the way I mean it.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.969
You never have.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.738
Since we were kids,
I've been in love with you,

10:40.774 --> 10:42.840
every minute

10:42.876 --> 10:44.942
of every day.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.946
You're the first person I
thought of when I woke up.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.749
Always have been.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.019
And if the Seelie Queen
had asked me that question?

10:55.054 --> 10:57.822
Kiss the one I most desired?

10:57.857 --> 10:59.824
No one would even come close.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.598
There's something between you
and Jace and you can't deny it.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.040
I don't know.

11:18.318 --> 11:21.712
Maybe. Maybe deep down there is,

11:21.748 --> 11:23.665
but Simon,

11:23.853 --> 11:26.854
it's nothing like you and me.

11:26.889 --> 11:28.889
It's nothing like it.

11:30.693 --> 11:31.859
But it's enough.

11:31.894 --> 11:34.795
Enough for me to know that...

11:34.830 --> 11:38.399
kissing you...

11:38.434 --> 11:41.702
trying to be more
than friends...

11:46.776 --> 11:49.443
It was a mistake.

12:02.976 --> 12:04.197
Is that tight enough?

12:05.729 --> 12:07.360
That's better.

12:13.681 --> 12:14.781
Go ahead, Jace.

12:14.847 --> 12:15.884
It's not gonna stop me.

12:16.037 --> 12:18.137
It's not some rune that
makes us who we are.

12:18.173 --> 12:21.274
It's our blood.
And yours, my boy,

12:21.309 --> 12:23.342
is exceptional.

12:23.378 --> 12:26.979
Because you experimented on me.
On my mother.

12:27.015 --> 12:29.046
Why? Why her?

12:29.096 --> 12:31.831
Sweet Celine.

12:32.253 --> 12:34.353
She wanted a child
so desperately.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.802
When she and Stephen learned that
she was pregnant again, with you,

12:37.826 --> 12:40.143
she was terrified that she
was gonna lose her baby.

12:40.225 --> 12:42.849
So she came to me,
asking for help.

12:43.367 --> 12:44.805
And I'm sure you were
so happy to oblige.

12:44.829 --> 12:46.360
The injections I
gave your mother,

12:46.391 --> 12:49.609
laced with Ithuriel's
pure angel blood

12:49.707 --> 12:53.008
made you strong.
After her tragic death,

12:53.069 --> 12:56.003
after I pulled you from her
womb, barely alive,

12:56.198 --> 13:00.133
I raised you to use that blood.
I taught you...

13:00.168 --> 13:03.069
You taught me not to feel.

13:03.105 --> 13:05.171
You taught me that "to
love is to destroy,

13:05.207 --> 13:07.207
and to be loved is to
be the one destroyed."

13:07.242 --> 13:09.943
And you've proven how
right I've been all along.

13:09.978 --> 13:11.845
Look at you.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.080
Your love for Clary,

13:14.116 --> 13:16.049
it will be your downfall.

13:16.084 --> 13:18.110
Don't you dare
bring her into this!

13:18.243 --> 13:21.788
She is as much a part
of this as you are.

13:53.021 --> 13:55.188
Simon.

13:55.223 --> 13:57.023
Hold up.

13:57.059 --> 13:58.959
Hey, Luke.

14:00.963 --> 14:03.129
Are you hungover?

14:03.165 --> 14:05.832
Um, kinda, actually. Yeah.

14:05.896 --> 14:08.130
Plasma?

14:08.136 --> 14:10.605
You gotta be careful, Simon.
That stuff is strong.

14:10.653 --> 14:12.491
I know.
It was just a one-time thing.

14:12.568 --> 14:14.238
I went out with a
couple of friends

14:14.276 --> 14:16.543
- and got a little carried away.
- It's understandable.

14:17.179 --> 14:19.179
Clary told me what happened.

14:20.916 --> 14:22.424
Listen, I just want you to know,

14:22.478 --> 14:25.018
whatever's going
on between you two,

14:25.053 --> 14:26.753
I'm always here for you.

14:27.713 --> 14:29.893
You're the closest thing
to a son that I got.

14:31.373 --> 14:33.273
Whether you like it or not.

14:33.795 --> 14:34.972
So I'm not grounded?

14:34.997 --> 14:36.930
- Don't push your luck.
- Ow.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.544
It feels like Metallica
is rehearsing in my head.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.135
Nothing a little
sleep can't fix.

14:43.719 --> 14:45.219
- Hey, one more thing.
- Yeh.

14:45.266 --> 14:47.099
You've been hanging out with
vamps, right?

14:47.130 --> 14:50.097
You hear of any of 'em feeding on
a mundane in Queens last night?

14:52.012 --> 14:54.848
What? No. Not at all. Why?

14:55.764 --> 14:58.098
A girl was found
dead, bite marks.

14:59.187 --> 15:01.159
Whoever did it was
one hungry vampire...

15:01.216 --> 15:03.316
Her body was completely
drained of blood.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.193
Wow.
No, I haven't heard anything.

15:07.229 --> 15:09.796
But if I do,
of course I'll tell you.

15:09.831 --> 15:11.931
Get some rest.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.802
What do you got, Detective?

15:15.837 --> 15:18.003
Tox screen came back clean.
Strange thing is,

15:18.083 --> 15:22.842
the coroner said she bled out
through those "track marks."

15:22.878 --> 15:24.210
Yeah, that is strange.

15:24.246 --> 15:25.398
I did get prints
off her bracelet.

15:25.422 --> 15:26.189
Any hits?

15:26.220 --> 15:28.708
You bet. Eighteen year
old male from Brooklyn.

15:29.151 --> 15:31.017
Name's Simon Lewis.

15:34.156 --> 15:37.001
Luke? Hello?

15:37.127 --> 15:39.159
Did I lose you?

15:39.194 --> 15:41.861
I swear I hate this phone...

15:43.131 --> 15:45.732
- Luke?
- Yeah, I'm here.

15:48.170 --> 15:51.171
Valentine's Circle rune has been
removed and I've assembled my team.

15:51.206 --> 15:53.999
Good. I'll feel a lot better
when he's out of the Institute.

15:54.112 --> 15:57.010
Have you secured Magnus
for the transfer?

15:57.045 --> 15:59.469
I think we should consider

15:59.563 --> 16:02.356
using a different warlock.
Catarina Loss lives in...

16:02.423 --> 16:05.601
We're talking about portalling the
Clave's Most Wanted into Idris.

16:05.668 --> 16:07.634
There's not many Warlocks
with that clearance.

16:07.677 --> 16:09.677
Besides, I want the best.
And that's Magnus.

16:09.725 --> 16:12.826
Look, Magnus isn't exactly...
in a great place right now.

16:12.941 --> 16:15.641
- He hasn't been sleeping.
- What's wrong?

16:15.931 --> 16:17.658
I don't know.
He says nothing's wrong.

16:17.712 --> 16:20.647
But I can tell he's not alright.

16:20.969 --> 16:23.203
You know, some people find
it hard to ask for help.

16:23.238 --> 16:26.973
If Magnus is hurting,
he might push you away.

16:27.008 --> 16:29.665
Thank you for the advice,
but I know Magnus.

16:29.751 --> 16:32.886
He needs his space.
We can use a different warlock.

16:33.181 --> 16:35.115
There you are.

16:35.150 --> 16:36.902
Any update on the mole?

16:36.954 --> 16:38.914
Yeah.
Whoever it was is a clever one.

16:39.029 --> 16:40.575
Left absolutely no trace.

16:40.589 --> 16:43.293
But I've been auditing
personnel files.

16:43.347 --> 16:45.740
I've found a few Shadowhunters
who have a personal stake

16:45.773 --> 16:47.020
in wanting Valentine dead.

16:47.026 --> 16:49.066
Family members killed,
relatives lost to the Circle.

16:49.164 --> 16:51.143
All with enough access and
clearance to pull it off.

16:51.167 --> 16:54.001
- Send me the list when you're done.
- By the angel.

16:55.871 --> 16:59.072
- Aline.
- In the flesh.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.095
It's been years.

17:02.197 --> 17:04.757
- What are you doing here?
- I would've given you both a heads up

17:05.213 --> 17:07.881
but I didn't want to
spook my dear cousin.

17:10.039 --> 17:12.973
Who disappears for half a
year only to show up here.

17:16.223 --> 17:19.159
Come here,
you gorgeous Englishman.

17:19.194 --> 17:21.060
It's good to see you, Aline.

17:21.096 --> 17:23.930
Sorry, excuse me.

17:24.866 --> 17:28.835
We were all so worried about you.
We thought you were dead.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.837
Yeah, I'm...

17:30.872 --> 17:32.129
I'm really sorry.

17:32.183 --> 17:35.118
Your Aunt Elodie was beside herself.
Then after she found out

17:35.191 --> 17:37.421
that you were safe, she still hadn't
heard from you. So she asked me

17:37.445 --> 17:40.012
to come here to make sure you're alright.
Are you...

17:40.047 --> 17:42.921
really a Yin Fen addict?

17:45.252 --> 17:47.186
He's clean now.

17:50.191 --> 17:52.324
I feel terrible.

17:52.359 --> 17:55.127
I should have called.

17:55.162 --> 17:57.329
I guess I'm just... ashamed,

17:57.364 --> 17:59.231
you know?

17:59.266 --> 18:01.200
I guess I'm not as perfect
as everyone thought.

18:02.203 --> 18:04.436
Trust me,
I never thought you were perfect.

18:07.041 --> 18:10.108
But something is
different about you.

18:11.245 --> 18:13.278
Well, you can tell
them all he's a hero.

18:13.314 --> 18:17.082
He saved my life,
and helped us defeat a greater demon.

18:18.085 --> 18:20.285
Yeah, look, I'll, um...

18:20.321 --> 18:23.155
I'll fill you in on
all the gory details

18:23.190 --> 18:24.456
once I finish this report.

18:24.492 --> 18:28.393
- How about dinner? Eight o'clock?
- Absolutely.

18:38.973 --> 18:41.139
Get up.

18:45.412 --> 18:48.013
Tell me everything there is to
know about your cousin Aline!

18:48.048 --> 18:49.948
Aline...? Why...?

18:49.984 --> 18:53.018
She's in New York.

18:53.053 --> 18:54.953
Tell me or she dies!

18:59.627 --> 19:01.987
I really don't know how tow to
tell you this, so I'm just...

19:02.018 --> 19:03.018
gonna say it.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.637
I think Simon killed somebody.

19:07.288 --> 19:08.250
He didn't do this.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.775
Simon's shirt was in that dumpster,
soaked in the victim's blood.

19:10.799 --> 19:12.053
His fingerprints
were on her bracelet.

19:12.077 --> 19:13.910
The only time he was
ever fingerprinted

19:13.952 --> 19:17.053
is when he signed up to coach Little
League. He would never hurt anyone.

19:17.082 --> 19:19.049
There has to be some
explanation for this.

19:19.084 --> 19:22.079
- I know Simon.
- The Simon you know is a vampire, Clary.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.867
A vampire with a broken heart.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.324
Demon blood...

19:27.359 --> 19:29.359
it changes a person.

19:29.394 --> 19:32.074
I should never have let him come
to the Seelie Court with me.

19:32.194 --> 19:34.915
From what I gather, he wasn't
really taking "no" for an answer.

19:34.982 --> 19:38.884
I gotta find him before
anybody else does.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.884
Wait.

19:40.922 --> 19:42.922
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

19:43.005 --> 19:45.639
In his emotional state,
I don't want you anywhere near him.

19:45.707 --> 19:48.177
He's the way he is because of
me, Luke.

19:48.256 --> 19:50.090
Please. Let me go with you.

19:52.073 --> 19:54.640
I need to make this right.

19:59.301 --> 20:01.134
- Is Quinn here?
- He stepped out.

20:01.170 --> 20:03.514
Why are you looking for Quinn?

20:03.565 --> 20:04.776
Nothing. It's nothing.

20:04.807 --> 20:07.016
It doesn't seem like
nothing, mi amigo.

20:09.011 --> 20:11.011
Raphael,
I think I killed a mundane.

20:11.046 --> 20:11.803
An innocent girl.

20:11.850 --> 20:14.390
But I don't know if I did.
I mean, I'm not a killer.

20:14.496 --> 20:15.803
I wouldn't hurt anyone,

20:15.817 --> 20:18.055
but...
maybe I don't know myself.

20:18.149 --> 20:19.236
Alright, listen.

20:20.122 --> 20:22.889
Calm down and tell me the
last thing you remember.

20:22.925 --> 20:24.812
Right. Um...

20:24.858 --> 20:27.961
Quinn bought me plasma and then
took us to the bleeder den, but

20:27.996 --> 20:29.329
that's where it all gets hazy.

20:29.364 --> 20:32.132
I kinda remember a
girl, and her arm,

20:32.167 --> 20:33.884
and me biting into her,

20:33.962 --> 20:36.857
but I completely black out.
Do you think he's at the den?

20:37.117 --> 20:39.210
No, it doesn't open
until midnight.

20:39.276 --> 20:41.006
Why is this happening to me?
I'm a good guy.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.312
I'm an organ donor.
I was an organ donor.

20:43.338 --> 20:45.944
- Do we still give organs as...
- Simon. Get a hold of yourself.

20:46.001 --> 20:48.201
- What do I do, turn myself in?
- No.

20:48.424 --> 20:51.258
What happens if you
go hungry in prison?

20:54.609 --> 20:58.378
Can I stay here and lay low?
Can you help me out?

20:58.432 --> 21:00.699
Yeah. Yeah, I can help you out.

21:01.620 --> 21:02.990
But I'm going to need
something in return.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.689
What do you want?
Anything. Anything.

21:06.654 --> 21:09.389
Tell me how you
became a Daylighter.

21:09.424 --> 21:11.657
- I told you I don't know.
- I don't believe you.

21:11.726 --> 21:13.726
And if you can't help me...

21:13.762 --> 21:15.762
I can't help you.

21:23.878 --> 21:27.673
The transfer is set for 0200.
Jace, arm up the transport team.

21:27.709 --> 21:29.609
I want everyone carrying
additional weaponry.

21:29.644 --> 21:32.712
Duncan, prepare Valentine's restraints.
The rest of you

21:32.747 --> 21:35.581
secure the perimeter. Dismissed.

21:36.518 --> 21:39.419
Sebastian, I have to be honest.

21:39.454 --> 21:41.554
I'm really worried about you.

21:41.589 --> 21:44.424
Don't be.

21:44.459 --> 21:46.692
I'm happy.

21:46.728 --> 21:48.694
Happier than I've
been in a long time.

21:48.730 --> 21:51.564
I just don't get it.
You are the squarest,

21:51.599 --> 21:53.833
most rule-abiding guy I know.

21:53.868 --> 21:56.736
And then you suddenly vanish
without telling anyone?

21:56.771 --> 22:00.506
It just doesn't add up.

22:05.413 --> 22:07.547
Look, I'm not...

22:07.582 --> 22:10.783
I'm not proud of it. But if anyone
should understand, it should be you.

22:10.819 --> 22:14.821
- And why is that?
- That summer I came to Alicante,

22:14.856 --> 22:19.425
you were secretly seeing that
girl, the one with the dimples.

22:20.662 --> 22:23.696
- Carolyn.
- Yeah. You kept it such a secret.

22:23.731 --> 22:25.927
Everyone thought you simply
hadn't found the right boy.

22:26.034 --> 22:28.734
They still think that.
Unless you blabbed?

22:28.770 --> 22:31.704
I would never do that.
I gave you my word.

22:31.739 --> 22:35.808
But you know how it feels to
have everyone in the world...

22:35.844 --> 22:39.679
see you one way but actually
being the exact opposite.

22:41.449 --> 22:43.483
You know,
I actually like taking risks.

22:44.619 --> 22:47.487
Yeah, sure,
the Yin Fen was a mistake, but...

22:47.522 --> 22:49.622
it led me to what I
believe is my destiny.

22:49.657 --> 22:51.791
Being here.

22:53.595 --> 22:55.461
Sadly Aunt Elodie isn't
very happy about it.

22:55.497 --> 22:58.664
I just got off the
phone with her.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.667
She's... she's heartbroken.

23:03.471 --> 23:04.796
Actually, I'm a bit worried.

23:04.836 --> 23:07.096
Do you mind spending
a few days with her?

23:07.116 --> 23:09.711
I'd go myself but they
really need me here.

23:09.717 --> 23:10.581
Yes.

23:10.612 --> 23:11.711
Of course.

23:11.746 --> 23:14.780
- I can leave tonight.
- Thank you.

23:17.122 --> 23:19.585
I mean, that is, of course,
not until I've shown you

23:19.621 --> 23:21.587
this fabulous Indian
place around the corner.

23:21.623 --> 23:24.423
- My favorite.
- Why do you think I picked it?

23:56.166 --> 24:00.742
C'mon, you have to remember...
What did you do?

24:08.972 --> 24:10.817
Care for seconds?

24:23.319 --> 24:26.120
Police! Freeze!

24:27.629 --> 24:29.695
Put your hands on your head!

24:31.881 --> 24:33.814
Drop to your knees.

24:35.531 --> 24:37.331
I'm sorry...

24:37.366 --> 24:39.466
I'm sorry I bit her.

24:39.502 --> 24:41.302
It was an accident.

24:42.505 --> 24:44.634
You're under arrest for the
murder of Heidi McKenzie.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.874
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Anything you say...

24:58.013 --> 25:01.552
Vampires aren't as easy to track,
but I don't think he's too far away.

25:01.577 --> 25:03.644
"Not far away" doesn't help us.
I need a direction.

25:04.460 --> 25:07.061
Turn left. Up here.

25:08.397 --> 25:11.365
So, when we do find
him, what happens then?

25:11.400 --> 25:14.877
I mean, if for some reason it
turns out he really did do this...

25:14.937 --> 25:16.736
he's a Vampire.
You can't just arrest him.

25:16.796 --> 25:18.850
That's why we need to find
him before the police do.

25:18.914 --> 25:20.769
Then what?

25:20.803 --> 25:23.904
We're supposed to turn
him over to the Clave.

25:26.223 --> 25:28.156
Can't we just keep this quiet?

25:28.191 --> 25:31.144
You know, like Alec did for you.

25:31.184 --> 25:34.528
If it's true,
if Simon did somehow lose control

25:34.584 --> 25:37.208
and make some horrible mistake,
we can't just give up on him.

25:37.227 --> 25:39.327
Look, whatever mess he's
gotten himself into,

25:40.137 --> 25:43.972
I promise I'm not
giving up on Simon.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.413
They say the bad guy always goes
back to the scene of the crime.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.335
I always thought it was a myth,

25:55.359 --> 25:57.759
but since I'd run out of
leads, I thought, hey, why not?

25:58.221 --> 26:00.822
So why'd you do it?

26:01.872 --> 26:04.039
- I told you. It was an accident.
- Right.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.127
So you just "accidentally"

26:06.202 --> 26:08.169
bit the woman and
drained her of blood?

26:09.806 --> 26:12.311
I can't help myself.
I guess you can call it a compulsion.

26:12.329 --> 26:14.129
Odd compulsion.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.451
You know, I've seen plenty of
different ways to kill people,

26:16.475 --> 26:18.342
but biting into a girl's feet?

26:18.377 --> 26:21.478
- That's a new one.
- Her feet?

26:22.615 --> 26:23.715
No. That can't be right.

26:23.776 --> 26:26.608
The M.E. says the wounds below
her ankle were the most recent.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.787
- I didn't do this.
- Excuse me?

26:29.822 --> 26:33.457
Ever since I was a kid,
feet have totally grossed me out.

26:33.492 --> 26:36.327
- Even women's feet.
- You know what grosses me out? Murder.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.295
There's no way I could've done this.
I didn't kill her.

26:38.310 --> 26:41.417
Seriously? An anti-foot fetish?
That's your defense? If I were you,

26:41.447 --> 26:43.713
I'd come up with something
a little more believ...

26:54.680 --> 26:56.647
So when I found your
front door open,

26:56.682 --> 26:59.483
I was afraid someone
broke into the apartment.

26:59.518 --> 27:02.653
- Yeah, thanks for calling me.
- No problem.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.751
Hey!

27:43.142 --> 27:44.408
Quinn!

27:47.546 --> 27:49.980
Ah, I heard you
were looking for me.

27:50.803 --> 27:54.505
It was you. The girl from last
night, Heidi, you killed her,

27:54.540 --> 27:57.508
- didn't you?
- It was an accident.

27:57.549 --> 28:00.583
Accidents happen.
She knew the risks.

28:00.613 --> 28:02.679
- Don't worry about it.
- A woman is dead!

28:02.715 --> 28:04.487
And I'm not letting
you get away with it.

28:05.236 --> 28:07.269
I'm telling everyone,
Luke, the Shadowhunters...

28:09.688 --> 28:12.589
Yeah... I...

28:12.625 --> 28:15.492
I can't let you do that.

28:46.436 --> 28:47.730
Daylighter or not,

28:47.763 --> 28:49.275
I'm not gonna let
you rat me out.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.124
- What are you doing here?
- Trying to track down a murderer.

29:09.148 --> 29:09.907
Stay out of it.

29:09.913 --> 29:12.188
This is vampire business.
I can take care of him myself.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.796
- I can't let you do that.
- Leave Simon alone.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.521
I'm not talking about the Daylighter.
Quinn killed the girl.

29:19.426 --> 29:21.192
Let's go.

29:57.765 --> 30:00.466
Simon!

30:07.675 --> 30:09.742
I didn't kill that girl.

30:09.777 --> 30:11.577
We know.

30:14.916 --> 30:17.483
Are you okay?

30:18.820 --> 30:20.786
No. Not really.

30:43.411 --> 30:44.810
Mama?

30:44.846 --> 30:47.713
- No!
- Weet je waarom ze dit deed? Door jou.

30:47.749 --> 30:49.548
Je bent een gruwel!

30:52.487 --> 30:54.587
Magnus?

30:57.625 --> 30:59.558
Magnus.

30:59.594 --> 31:01.560
Well, hello.

31:02.530 --> 31:05.564
I was just about to make myself a drink.
Want one?

31:07.902 --> 31:10.870
No. We're transporting
Valentine to Idris.

31:10.905 --> 31:13.472
Even more reason... We can toast

31:13.508 --> 31:16.509
to Valentine's highly
anticipated departure.

31:16.544 --> 31:19.845
I love you,
and I know something's wrong.

31:19.881 --> 31:21.681
Whatever it is,
I'm here for you.

31:23.885 --> 31:27.687
- I appreciate it. But I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

31:27.722 --> 31:30.423
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
leave until you talk to me.

31:31.893 --> 31:35.461
Remember when you said "when things
get crazy, don't push me away"?

31:44.572 --> 31:47.807
When I was tortured
in Valentine's body,

31:47.842 --> 31:50.101
that agony rune

31:50.511 --> 31:52.745
made me relive my worst memory.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.448
And now...

31:57.552 --> 31:59.518
I can't get it out of my head.

31:59.554 --> 32:01.754
Every time I close my eyes...

32:04.759 --> 32:07.660
Hey...

32:07.695 --> 32:09.495
What is it?

32:10.832 --> 32:14.467
Remember I told you how I found
my mother dead by her own hand?

32:14.502 --> 32:17.570
My stepfather found
me shortly after.

32:17.605 --> 32:19.805
He screamed at me.

32:19.841 --> 32:22.708
He called me an abomination.

32:22.744 --> 32:23.843
What?

32:25.880 --> 32:28.447
He was right.

32:30.518 --> 32:33.619
He blamed me for her suicide.

32:33.654 --> 32:36.722
He said that she hated herself
for giving birth to a monster.

32:40.595 --> 32:42.728
So I lashed out.

32:44.766 --> 32:47.733
With all the magic I had.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.614
I burned him, Alexander.

33:03.417 --> 33:06.452
Right where he stood.

33:07.622 --> 33:09.789
I murdered my stepfather.

33:11.926 --> 33:13.659
You were just a boy.

33:13.694 --> 33:16.862
You weren't in control
of your powers.

33:16.898 --> 33:21.400
Yes, actually, I was.

33:23.571 --> 33:25.704
I never wanted
you to see this...

33:25.740 --> 33:28.808
terrible,

33:28.843 --> 33:31.811
ugly side of me,

33:31.846 --> 33:34.713
of my past...

33:38.419 --> 33:39.819
Hey.

33:46.661 --> 33:49.628
There's nothing ugly about you.

34:03.511 --> 34:07.413
I wanted to say goodbye to Sebastian.
I wonder where he ran off to.

34:07.448 --> 34:09.648
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

34:17.625 --> 34:20.559
So, when are you going
to come visit Alicante?

34:20.594 --> 34:22.594
Soon.

34:23.797 --> 34:26.532
As long as you promise
your mom won't drag us

34:26.567 --> 34:28.634
to the Accords Hall for
another Clave assembly.

34:28.668 --> 34:30.569
I definitely can't promise that.

34:59.982 --> 35:02.588
I still don't get what your
obsession is with this restaurant.

35:02.682 --> 35:03.774
Have a seat.

35:08.476 --> 35:10.082
I want to talk to you
about Simon Lewis.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.765
Luke, I...
I've never seen anything like it.

35:12.771 --> 35:14.759
It was straight out of
some superhero movie.

35:14.791 --> 35:17.721
- Did you mention it to anyone?
- No. I took your advice.

35:17.786 --> 35:19.686
I don't want people
to think I'm crazy.

35:20.135 --> 35:21.968
I'm sorry you had to see
that, Ollie.

35:22.003 --> 35:23.970
What?
What do you mean you're sorry?

35:24.005 --> 35:27.073
- Luke, what are you talking about? I...
- I'm not proud

35:27.108 --> 35:28.525
of what I have to do,
but it's for your own protection.

35:28.549 --> 35:32.451
- The Shadow World is a dangerous place.
- The Shadow what?

35:32.881 --> 35:35.815
And who the hell is he?

35:43.725 --> 35:46.993
You will forget the
name Simon Lewis.

35:47.028 --> 35:48.366
He will no longer exist to you.

35:48.449 --> 35:51.317
Daniel Quinn murdered
Heidi McKenzie.

35:51.933 --> 35:55.001
He's disappeared.

35:55.036 --> 35:57.770
We will never find him.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.023
Simon...

36:17.058 --> 36:19.025
Sorry. Izzy said I
could wait here for you.

36:19.060 --> 36:22.695
Of course. I'm...
I'm so glad you're here.

36:25.526 --> 36:27.426
This hasn't been easy for me.

36:27.902 --> 36:31.871
I mean, I thought dying was bad.
This is way worse.

36:33.975 --> 36:35.738
I'm so sorry.

36:35.883 --> 36:38.984
That night on the Promenade,
when we first kissed,

36:39.848 --> 36:41.848
we made a vow.

36:41.883 --> 36:44.050
Remember?

36:44.085 --> 36:45.985
How could I forget?

36:48.123 --> 36:50.923
We promised that we
would always be friends.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.420
No matter what.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.929
I'm a man of my word.

36:58.900 --> 37:02.769
When I make a vow, I uphold it.

37:06.107 --> 37:09.041
I can't imagine a world
without you in it, Fray.

37:09.077 --> 37:11.778
Me neither.

37:15.016 --> 37:18.084
But I need time.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.126
How much time?

37:27.162 --> 37:29.996
I'm not sure.

37:34.969 --> 37:37.870
Well...

37:40.008 --> 37:41.641
Whenever you're ready.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.945
I will be here.

37:47.115 --> 37:49.682
Always.

38:36.030 --> 38:38.898
Valentine Morgenstern,
by order of the Clave,

38:38.933 --> 38:41.667
you are hereby remanded
to the Gard in Idris.

38:52.847 --> 38:56.422
I may be in a cell,
but at least I'll be in Alicante...

38:56.517 --> 38:59.418
where the air doesn't
reek of Downworlders.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.664
Get him out of here.

39:50.838 --> 39:54.298
- Where's the prisoner?
- I don't know,

39:54.428 --> 39:56.261
- Consul Dieudonne.
- What happened to Duncan?

39:56.778 --> 39:59.111
Where the Angel is Valentine?

40:12.193 --> 40:13.930
I did as you asked.

40:13.942 --> 40:17.344
I brought Valentine here.
Now, please...

40:18.199 --> 40:20.166
let my family go.

40:22.937 --> 40:25.001
Thank you, Duncan.

40:25.113 --> 40:27.346
You did uphold your
end of the bargain.

40:30.111 --> 40:33.179
But I'm afraid that
I cannot uphold mine.

40:45.927 --> 40:48.060
What do you want from me?

40:56.157 --> 40:57.990
Hello,

40:58.840 --> 41:01.841
Father.
