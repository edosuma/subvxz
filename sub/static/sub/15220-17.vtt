10:03.247 --> 10:06.458
OK, OK, OK, OK!

10:06.458 --> 10:08.919
April 12th, 1974.

10:08.919 --> 10:11.630
Your name is Jeffrey Mole,

10:11.630 --> 10:14.591
and you're the lead singer
in an English rock group

10:14.591 --> 10:16.260
called King Thunder.

10:16.260 --> 10:19.429
Yeah. I never heard of them before.
You were a nerd back then.

10:19.429 --> 10:21.223
You wouldn't know them.

10:21.223 --> 10:24.935
Your nickname is Tonic,
which is short for Vodka Tonic,

10:24.935 --> 10:27.354
which relates
to some drinking escapade

10:27.354 --> 10:29.106
you had early in your career.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.775
So, what, I'm here to help them play
Madison Square Garden,

10:31.775 --> 10:33.860
or become bigger
than The Beatles, right?

10:33.860 --> 10:35.445
No, no. You don't remember?
What?

10:35.445 --> 10:37.781
This was big news.
It was in the papers, on TV.

10:37.781 --> 10:38.907
What?

10:38.907 --> 10:41.702
Well, two night from now,
right after the concert,

10:41.702 --> 10:46.915
some crazy nut stabs you just
as you're getting into your limo.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.251
You get killed.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.287
So who kills me? 
Who kills Tonic?

11:03.287 --> 11:05.414
We don't know.
He disappeared into the crowd.

11:07.041 --> 11:11.045
How can you stab somebody
in front of hundreds of witnesses,
and then just disappear?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.714
I'm trying to tell you
what happened. I can't explain it.

11:13.714 --> 11:18.594
It was probably some nutcase
like that Mark David Chapman.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.806
Who?
The rat that shot John Lennon.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.812
Al, I...I saw
somebody like that today.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.147
You did? What did he look like?

11:31.732 --> 11:37.697
Uh...blond. Uh, young. 16 or 17.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.701
He had on an army jacket and...
What?

11:43.369 --> 11:46.163
Well, a k-kind of
a...haunted expression.

11:46.163 --> 11:50.167
Well, Ziggy can't find anyone
that fits that profile
in your probability matrix.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.544
It must be a stranger.

11:51.544 --> 11:55.089
Why would a complete stranger wanna
kill me? That doesn't make sense!

11:55.089 --> 11:57.550
You're the one with all the PhDs.
You tell me!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.635
(SIRENS WAIL IN THE DISTANCE)

12:01.679 --> 12:05.391
Process schizophrenia.
Yeah, that's a possibility.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.686
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
Process schizophonic, yeah.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.604
No, no. Process schizophrenia.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.899
Most schizophrenics
never become violent,

12:13.899 --> 12:17.486
but in process schizophrenia
a person's sense of self

12:17.486 --> 12:19.321
is slow in developing.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.992
It's kind of like they don't have
a complete personality,

12:22.992 --> 12:27.246
so they fill up what's missing
by imitating something that they see.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.498
Like that kid
who shot President Regan.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.167
Oh, Hinckley?
Yeah, Hinckley.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.711
He repeatedly watched
Taxi Driver, the movie,

12:33.711 --> 12:36.964
over and over again, about this guy
who stalks a political candidate.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.090
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.509
And then the rest is history,
as they say.

12:40.509 --> 12:44.555
Yeah, right. But we don't even know
if that's what this guy is or...

12:44.555 --> 12:47.975
According to Ziggy, these anonymous
killers come in all types.

12:47.975 --> 12:51.896
Most of them are obsessive
and some of them are loners.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.441
If you ask them about their lives,
they say one thing but in reality-

12:55.441 --> 12:58.652
The truth is completely different.
That's right.

12:58.652 --> 13:01.864
And this one is apparently obsessed
with you, with Tonic.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
Yeah.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.994
Listen, on this leap,
I want you to stay really close, OK?

13:06.994 --> 13:09.914
Because if we see him, I don't wanna
take a chance on losing him.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.415
I'll stick with you like glue.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.543
Right.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.267

and we got the heat, man!

Hey, you're back on the case
with Eliot Chase.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.735
Listen, we're broadcasting live
today from a rather-

13:39.735 --> 13:42.112
A rather tacky establishment.

13:42.112 --> 13:45.282
Yeah, t-thank you. Yes, it is
a rather tacky shopping mall here.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.952
If you're just turning in, man,
you have been missing out,

13:47.952 --> 13:51.121
because my very special guest
with me right now is King Thunder!

13:51.121 --> 13:53.207
(CHEERING)

13:54.708 --> 13:58.003
All right. Tonic, let me just talk
to you for one second here.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.048
Your last album, Five All Night,
was heavy, man.

14:01.048 --> 14:05.552
The best track on it by far
was Faith's Wide Wheel.

14:05.552 --> 14:08.430
How did you write that song?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.015
Holding a pen.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.267
(LAUGHTER)

14:11.267 --> 14:14.728
Yeah! Yeah, but I mean,
what was going through your mind?

14:14.728 --> 14:17.356
Well, nothing. He hasn't got one!
(LAUGHS)

14:17.356 --> 14:20.693
Honestly, Tonic's got a great mind.
Oh, yes.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.697
It's just a bit of bother to get him
to think about something besides...

14:24.697 --> 14:26.824
Besides women,
you were gonna say, right?

14:26.824 --> 14:29.326
Yeah, well, who can blame him?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.954
But if I can get back on track
for just one second.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.665
Tonic, what were you thinking
when you wrote,

14:34.665 --> 14:40.045
"As I travel in space and time,
I wanna stay, I wanna go.

14:40.045 --> 14:43.632
You can see my face,
but it's not mine.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.928
What you can't see,
you'll never know"?

14:47.928 --> 14:50.097
What can't we see?

14:50.097 --> 14:52.558
Our ugly faces for one thing.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.893
Why do you think we wear
this bloody make-up?

14:54.893 --> 14:56.478
(LAUGHS)

14:56.478 --> 15:03.110
Well, I guess what I,
what I really was...meaning to say

15:03.110 --> 15:11.869
was, uh, that...
we all live our lives behind masks.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.955
But the real point of living

15:14.955 --> 15:20.002
is to get beyond,
to break through those masks,

15:20.002 --> 15:24.673
from the outside and from the inside,
so that we can really communicate.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.637
Unfortunately, most of us don't.

15:30.637 --> 15:33.849
That's so true.
Great, great!

15:36.894 --> 15:39.438
Hi.
Hi.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.321
Do you have something for me to sign?
Uh, yeah.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:59.208 --> 16:00.209

16:00.918 --> 16:04.087

16:05.380 --> 16:06.381
Al!

16:14.890 --> 16:16.016
Got him!

16:16.016 --> 16:17.643
Excuse me, Tonic?

16:17.643 --> 16:21.688
Oh...I, I thought I saw

16:21.688 --> 16:24.775
someone that I hadn't seen
in a really, really long time.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.861
But I-I guess it really wasn't him.

16:27.861 --> 16:32.616
Gushie, he's still moving.
Keep me centred on him.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.619
Tonight's gonna be your next-to-last
concert in Detroit, right?

16:35.619 --> 16:38.997
Right, and we'll be world-premiering
some new songs, which I've written.

16:38.997 --> 16:42.125
Really? What? Now that's a first.
You must be really excited.

16:42.125 --> 16:46.630
Oh, not at all, actually, cos I know
Tonic's gonna do a bang-up job!

16:46.630 --> 16:48.173
(CHUCKLES)

16:49.299 --> 16:51.927
It should really be exciting.
Looking forward to it!

Let me see. April 23rd, 1974.

more difficult than others.

It's one thing to study lyrics
and guitar charts

18:32.944 --> 18:34.821
in the privacy
of your own hotel room,

18:34.821 --> 18:37.199

to remember them

18:37.199 --> 18:39.993
when you're in front

18:41.536 --> 18:43.955
Where have you been?
Huh?

18:43.955 --> 18:47.125
Oh, I've been, I've been running
some scenarios through Ziggy

18:47.125 --> 18:48.877
on this kid, Philip Silbart.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.712
You found out his name. What else?

18:50.712 --> 18:55.550
Of course I... Oh, well,
he was born in Hastings, Nebraska.

18:55.550 --> 18:59.429
He was raised by his mother,
Priscilla, and his...

18:59.429 --> 19:01.139
Oh, that poor kid's illegitimate.

19:01.139 --> 19:05.227
Anyway, his mother died in 1970,

19:05.227 --> 19:08.480
two years after they lost this
little farm they were living on.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.524
And since then
he's been running away

19:10.524 --> 19:13.318
from a series of foster homes
and county agencies.

19:13.318 --> 19:17.864
His social worker says
he's emotionally disturbed.

19:17.864 --> 19:21.117
Anyway, Ziggy thinks
he's gonna end up homeless,

19:21.117 --> 19:22.911
and he's a perfect candidate.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.246
Well, look-
Tonic?

19:24.246 --> 19:27.791
Some bank bloke called for you
from Utah about a ranch.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.919
Uh...a ranch?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.963
He wanted me to give you a message.

19:32.963 --> 19:37.384
He said your cheque bounced
and unless you give him another one,

19:37.384 --> 19:39.553
you can't do it.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.263
OK. Thanks.

19:42.138 --> 19:44.516
Any time!

I-I gotta talk with Philip.

19:50.438 --> 19:53.984
Man, this kid doesn't want to talk
to you. He wants to kill you!

19:53.984 --> 19:57.028
Now, come on!
You gotta rehearse the song!

19:57.028 --> 20:00.407

Are you OK, Sam?

I think so.
I just banged my head a little.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.409
Oh, damn!

20:44.409 --> 20:47.912
It might have knocked
some sense into him!

20:47.912 --> 20:50.040
Where's Philip?
Philip?

20:51.207 --> 20:52.667
Maybe it did hit him after all.

20:52.667 --> 20:56.004
He's still back in his hotel room.
He couldn't have done this.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.799
Tonic, are you OK?
How the hell did this happen?

20:59.799 --> 21:03.428

Oh, no kidding, Sherlock!

21:03.428 --> 21:06.556

Unless somebody else did it.

A rest, a hot shower,
and you'll be as good as new.

21:08.808 --> 21:12.812
Whittler, I want you to find out
who's responsible for this!

21:12.812 --> 21:15.398
You got sloppy! And then get
this thing back up there.

21:15.398 --> 21:17.901
And this time make sure it stays!
Yeah, sure.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.738
Everyone back to the hotel!
We've got a big night ahead of us!

21:21.738 --> 21:23.239
Yeah, I'm coming.

21:23.239 --> 21:26.076
The only safe place for these drums
is off stage!

21:26.076 --> 21:28.203
Maybe Philip set this thing up
in advance.

21:28.203 --> 21:31.998
Well, even if he could have, how
could he have triggered that thing

21:31.998 --> 21:33.166
to make it fall?

21:33.166 --> 21:36.544
How do you know?
Especially since he's not even here.

21:36.544 --> 21:38.755
He couldn't.
Not unless he's a psychic.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.049
Like one of those guys
that can bend spoons.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.635
OK, so Philip didn't do it,

21:43.635 --> 21:45.929
so we're back to it
either being an accident,

21:45.929 --> 21:47.680
or somebody else setting it up.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.809
It had to be someone
who could get past security.

21:51.810 --> 21:56.606
Unless security did it.
Have anything on Whittler?

21:56.606 --> 22:00.068
Rode with a biker gang,
a bunch of arrests.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.487
Ah, did two years for armed robbery.

22:02.487 --> 22:06.950
And once he, he was arrested
for attempted manslaughter.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.660
But he wasn't convicted.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.787
He's real buddy-buddy with Flash.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.624
And Flash would become the leader
of this band if...

22:14.624 --> 22:17.377
If you went up to the big amplifier
in the sky.

22:27.849 --> 22:29.809

22:35.106 --> 22:38.192
Tonic, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be resting.

22:38.192 --> 22:40.361
Yeah, I know.
I-I just wanted to talk to you.

22:40.361 --> 22:42.572
You got a second?
Sure. What's on your mind?

22:44.157 --> 22:46.868
You know that ranch
I'm buying in Utah?

22:46.868 --> 22:48.703
Ranch? What ranch?

22:48.703 --> 22:53.833
My bank called today.
Told me that the cheque bounced.

22:53.833 --> 22:55.793
Of course the cheque bounced!

22:55.793 --> 22:58.880
I don't leave money lying around
in your check-in account.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.132
I've got it working for you.
I understand that-

23:01.132 --> 23:04.343
I've told you a million times not to
go off on these wild spending sprees

23:04.343 --> 23:06.095
without talking to me first.

23:06.095 --> 23:08.931
That way I can transfer the right
amount of money to your account.

23:10.099 --> 23:14.020
OK, OK. The damage is done.
Why don't you tell me how much money
you've blown this time?

23:14.020 --> 23:17.148
Uh, well, a lot. Sort of.

23:17.148 --> 23:20.985
And now it's a ranch, eh? What
do you want with a ranch, anyway?

23:22.320 --> 23:27.241
I just want a ranch. There's no
problem with the money, is there?

23:27.241 --> 23:31.621
No, no! It's just tied up
in long-term stuff.

23:31.621 --> 23:32.872
If we cash in right now,

23:32.872 --> 23:35.708
well, we won't make quite
as much money as we could have.

23:35.708 --> 23:39.462
Get me the name of the bank and I'll
get a cheque to them right away.

23:40.922 --> 23:44.717
Yeah, well, I-I got..
I got the number back in my room,

23:44.717 --> 23:46.969
so I-I'll just go
and I'll get it to you later, OK?

23:46.969 --> 23:49.305
Right. Then I'll call them.

23:49.305 --> 23:53.017
And you can go and play Roy Rogers
to your heart's content!

23:53.017 --> 23:56.229
Now go and get some rest, Tonic.
You got a big night, tonight.

Now, look at me.

24:21.420 --> 24:24.131
I cannot do this! I am not a rocker!

24:24.131 --> 24:27.260
You can do this, Sam!
I can't do it!

24:27.260 --> 24:30.596
I'm gonna go out there and they're
gonna hear me sing, and kill me!

24:30.596 --> 24:32.598
I mean,
I don't sing like those people!

24:32.598 --> 24:35.643
When I grew up,
I listened to Simon & Garfunkel.

24:35.643 --> 24:38.062
Sam, they're not gonna kill you.
They're not!

24:38.062 --> 24:41.315
All you do is you go out there and
you make an idiot out of yourself.

24:41.315 --> 24:43.234
Oh, fine.
Yes! They'll eat it up!

24:43.234 --> 24:45.528
That's what they expect
of rock stars!

24:45.528 --> 24:47.822
I don't have the faintest idea
of how to act.

24:47.822 --> 24:50.574
These people, they got a whole style.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.159
Do Hendrix!

You take to the guitar like this
and you go... (MAKES GUITAR NOISE)

24:55.913 --> 24:58.332

with his teeth.

24:58.332 --> 24:59.458
Hendrix?
Yeah.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.336
Or do Townshend.
Who?

25:02.336 --> 25:04.255
That's right.
What is?

25:04.255 --> 25:06.674
Who.
I don't know.

25:06.674 --> 25:08.884
Townshend!
Who?

25:08.884 --> 25:11.595
Yeah, that's right.
Pete Townshend of The Who.

25:11.595 --> 25:12.930
Of the what?!
Never mind.

25:12.930 --> 25:16.767
He used to do the windmill.
Like that, you know.

25:16.767 --> 25:20.771
If it really gets desperate
and they start charging up on stage,

25:20.771 --> 25:22.898
and they're gonna rip
your clothes off,

25:22.898 --> 25:26.277
you stick your tongue out as far as
you can and you wiggle it like that.

25:26.277 --> 25:29.530
That is gonna make them stop
from ripping my clothes off?

25:29.530 --> 25:32.074
No, that'll make them start
ripping their clothes off.

25:32.074 --> 25:34.660
Then you can take the guitar
and you can smash it to pieces.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.078
That always gets 'em!

25:36.078 --> 25:38.456
Al, with my luck,
they're gonna want an encore,

25:38.456 --> 25:39.999
and I'm not gonna have a guitar-

25:39.999 --> 25:42.835
Don't worry, Sam!
Just go out there and cut loose!

25:42.835 --> 25:44.879
I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

25:44.879 --> 25:49.175
If worse comes to worse,
do Milli Vanilli.

28:14.695 --> 28:17.489
We thought you could use
a bit of cheering up, Tonic!

28:17.489 --> 28:20.242
Well, what I could really use
is a little quiet.

28:20.242 --> 28:21.869
Ah, all right. No problem.

28:23.662 --> 28:25.080
(SHOUTS) Quiet!

28:28.459 --> 28:31.003
Hey, no problem, man.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.758
Oh, hi. How are you doing?

28:35.758 --> 28:38.677
Listen,
I-I-I'll talk to you later, OK?

28:38.677 --> 28:41.221
Hey, hey! Hey, come here!

28:43.057 --> 28:44.808
(CHUCKLES)

28:44.808 --> 28:48.937
How about a nice little
vodka tonic, Tonic?!

28:48.937 --> 28:50.314
(LAUGHS)

28:50.314 --> 28:51.648
Thanks, I'll pass!

28:51.648 --> 28:54.568
That's good!

28:54.568 --> 28:57.362
You should be in costume!

28:57.362 --> 28:59.615
He's right, mate!

28:59.615 --> 29:02.159
Listen... I'm sorry! Excuse me.

29:02.159 --> 29:04.244
Excuse me... Oh, hi, Sandy. Sorry.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.038
You wanna do it again?

29:06.038 --> 29:08.832
Uh, well, no. Not really, not really.

29:08.832 --> 29:12.169
Oh, Tonic...I've got this...

29:15.631 --> 29:16.715
..problem.

29:16.715 --> 29:18.092
Take a look!

29:18.092 --> 29:20.969
(CHUCKLES) Your bird, right?

29:20.969 --> 29:22.846
Come on, come on!

29:22.846 --> 29:25.390
Well, I-I'm sure
that Flash can handle it.

29:25.390 --> 29:31.772
Well, Flash can handle just about
anything except...a real woman.

29:31.772 --> 29:35.818
Yeah, well...that's, that's great.
I'm glad you told me that.

29:35.818 --> 29:40.572
I really don't think it's wise to go
swimming in another man's pool.

29:40.572 --> 29:43.909
I'm not in another man's pool.
Especially if that man is Flash.

29:43.909 --> 29:48.080
Uh, l-look, S-Sandy... (CHUCKLES)

29:48.080 --> 29:52.084
Uh, I-I'm sure whatever the thing is,
the problem is he can handle it.

29:52.084 --> 29:55.170
If you just give him a chance...
Oh, but I wanna give YOU the chance.

29:55.170 --> 29:58.715
Oh, thanks, thanks. But why don't
we talk about this tomorrow, OK?

29:58.715 --> 30:00.175
Or next week?

30:00.175 --> 30:03.887
(GIGGLES)
I wanna do more than just talk.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.015
Ciao.

30:07.015 --> 30:09.351
Ciao.
Ciao.

30:16.316 --> 30:20.821
Al, it's five o'clock in the morning.
Don't these people ever go home?

30:22.864 --> 30:26.660
Tonic, what, you lost in space?
It's your party, mate!

30:26.660 --> 30:28.078
Yeah, you're right!

30:28.078 --> 30:32.541
Ziggy says there's a 60% chance
that Dwayne is embezzling you guys.

30:32.541 --> 30:35.210
That's how come your cheque bounced.

30:35.210 --> 30:38.630
The trail is kind of fuzzy,
but it appears

30:38.630 --> 30:41.633
that he's been trading and losing
more money on the stock market

30:41.633 --> 30:43.218
than he makes in a year.

30:43.218 --> 30:47.097
What about Whittler?
17% chance to knock you off.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.391
Al, there's gotta be a prime suspect,

30:49.391 --> 30:52.185
so just have Ziggy
go over the scenarios again.

30:52.185 --> 30:55.314
Well, it looks like
a three-way toss-up.

30:55.314 --> 30:59.026
Everybody seems to be
equally looking guilty or innocent,

30:59.026 --> 31:00.944
depending on which way
you look at it.

31:00.944 --> 31:04.906
Yeah, well, then, we're gonna have
to keep a close eye on everybody.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.366
Yeah.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.412
Where's Philip right now?

31:10.412 --> 31:15.292
I don't know.
Gushie, centre me on Philip.

31:18.378 --> 31:21.965
Gushie, quit fooling around!
I'm trying to find Philip!

31:21.965 --> 31:23.967
He says he's here.
What?

31:23.967 --> 31:27.262
Also, he says there's a fifty-fifty
chance that you get it now.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.847
Now?
Yeah, at the party.

31:52.079 --> 31:54.456
Whittler!
Hey, you're hurting my arm!

31:54.456 --> 31:56.416
What's wrong?
How did this kid get in here?

31:56.416 --> 31:59.044
He must have slipped by
when Eddie was on the door.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.754
These kids are all alike.

32:00.754 --> 32:03.090
They get in here
and steal everything they can.

32:03.090 --> 32:05.801
I didn't steal anything!
What do you call this?

32:05.801 --> 32:08.845
Sam, that's part of your costume.
What else you got on you?

32:11.098 --> 32:13.266
What about this knife?

32:13.266 --> 32:14.476
Take it easy, would you?

32:14.476 --> 32:17.437
Look, I don't wanna hurt you,
but I don't wanna get hurt either.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.980
I'd never hurt you.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.985
You're my father.
You're his father?

32:23.985 --> 32:29.032
Ah, next time, be sure
to check your raincoat, sport!

32:29.032 --> 32:32.202
Come on.
No, w-w-wait a second.

32:32.202 --> 32:35.664
Listen, I-I'm gonna talk to this...
What's your name?

32:35.664 --> 32:40.252
Philip. Philip Silbart.
Philip here. It's cool. Come on.

32:48.593 --> 32:50.220
(SIGHS)

32:52.138 --> 32:54.057
So what makes you think
that I'm your father?

32:55.809 --> 33:00.438
Mu mom told me. She always had
your picture around and...

33:00.438 --> 33:02.148
And your albums.

33:05.277 --> 33:09.281
And one day she started crying
and...and she told me.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.992
Told you that I was your father.
She said that...

33:12.951 --> 33:16.037
You know, you...you did it
after your concert in Omaha,

33:16.037 --> 33:18.415
the first time you guys
came over here from England.

33:18.415 --> 33:22.961
Well, Sam, King Thunder
did play Omaha 16 years ago.

33:22.961 --> 33:25.589
Of course then they were called
The Dingles.

33:26.798 --> 33:28.884
Things do happen after concerts.

33:28.884 --> 33:33.305
Look, Philip, I was in Omaha a
long time ago, but that doesn't mean-

33:33.305 --> 33:34.973
I sound like you.
What?

33:34.973 --> 33:36.975
I can play guitar just like you.

33:38.810 --> 33:41.438
I sing just like you.
That's because you're my father.

33:41.438 --> 33:43.857
A lot of people
have very similar voices

33:43.857 --> 33:45.734
and sound alike when they sing.

33:46.943 --> 33:49.279
Look.
You and I have got the same hand.

33:49.279 --> 33:53.241
See, I got this little web of skin
just like you.

34:06.046 --> 34:08.757
I don't want any money from you.

34:08.757 --> 34:13.011
I don't want anything. I just want
you to admit that you're my father.

34:22.130 --> 34:24.675
SAM: 'Even though Philip and I
share the set of webbed fingers,

34:25.887 --> 34:29.306
there was still only a 50% chance
I was his father,

34:29.306 --> 34:31.726
but a 99% chance
I was still going to get killed.

34:31.726 --> 34:33.395
That meant to catch the killer,

34:33.395 --> 34:36.313
I was still going to have
to do the concert.'

34:36.313 --> 34:38.733
(CHUCKLES) What the hell is that?

34:38.733 --> 34:40.819
Ah, someone nicked me bloody wig!

34:40.819 --> 34:43.321
I'll have the roadies
go out and fetch another one.

34:43.321 --> 34:45.364
Stupid fans!

34:45.364 --> 34:49.536
Just remember,
tonight we do my songs, right?

34:51.121 --> 34:52.414
Right.

34:52.414 --> 34:53.581
(CHUCKLES)

34:53.581 --> 34:57.877
Right. Then let's get this
bleeding thing over with, all right?

34:57.877 --> 35:00.547
Right!
Right! Bloody right!

35:00.547 --> 35:02.716
Hey, Kev, where are we?

35:02.716 --> 35:04.551
Uh, Detroit.

35:04.551 --> 35:07.053
BOTH: Hello, Detroit!

35:07.053 --> 35:08.096
AL: Sam!

35:09.222 --> 35:11.516
Hey, Whittler,
will you take this up for me?

35:11.516 --> 35:13.435
Yeah.
I'll be right out.

35:17.313 --> 35:22.110
I just...I just...think that you...
I think you should bail out of this.

35:22.110 --> 35:24.112
I can't bail out of this, Al!

35:24.112 --> 35:27.365
I gotta...I gotta figure out
who kills Tonic and stop him!

35:27.365 --> 35:28.491
No, well, I-

35:28.491 --> 35:31.035
Hey, Tonic, what are you doing?
We're ready for you.

35:31.035 --> 35:34.247
Oh, yeah. Well...
Yeah, I'm coming right out. Coming!

35:34.247 --> 35:37.709
Hey, Dwayne, uh...gotta talk to you
for a second, man.

35:42.338 --> 35:45.467
Listen, how much money of ours
have you lost

35:45.467 --> 35:48.011
on the stock market so far this year?

35:48.011 --> 35:51.264
None! I mean,
stocks go up and down, but...

35:51.264 --> 35:55.518
Dwayne, I had a friend check in
to your private account.

35:55.518 --> 35:57.604
Now, you've been gambling
more than you make.

35:57.604 --> 35:59.564
That money's coming from somewhere.

35:59.564 --> 36:01.441
And I'd hate to call
for a personal audit,

36:01.441 --> 36:04.152
because I think we both know
where that money's coming from.

36:04.152 --> 36:06.654
Tonic, it just got
a little bit away from me.

36:06.654 --> 36:10.366
Ah, see? I told you!
He's the killer! You slimy weasel!

36:10.366 --> 36:14.704
I can get it back. Give me time.
You can have all your money now.

36:14.704 --> 36:16.873
But you've just got
to give me the chance.

36:24.214 --> 36:27.091
OK. OK.

36:27.091 --> 36:29.385
Thanks, man.

36:29.385 --> 36:33.348
And, Dwayne...tonight when we leave,
after the concert,

36:33.348 --> 36:35.975
I don't wanna ride
in the same limo with Flash.

36:35.975 --> 36:41.105
And...and bring all the limos around
to a different exit, you know,

36:41.105 --> 36:43.107
because I-I-I hate that exit!

36:43.107 --> 36:45.568
OK. Whatever you say.
OK? I'm sick of it.

36:45.568 --> 36:48.571
OK. And...thanks, man.
OK.

36:50.865 --> 36:52.408
(EXHALES)

36:52.408 --> 36:55.495
You know, that idea
about the limos is great.

36:55.495 --> 36:57.372
I always say play it safe.

36:57.372 --> 36:59.040
Tonic?
Huh?

36:59.040 --> 37:01.751
Don't be coy with me, Tonic.

37:04.462 --> 37:10.218
I can see it in your eyes.
You were just pretending last night.

37:10.218 --> 37:14.222
You want me, and I want you.

37:14.222 --> 37:16.891
What about me?
Oh, boy!

37:16.891 --> 37:18.184
You got it.

37:18.184 --> 37:22.313
What?! Dwayne told me you were here!

37:22.313 --> 37:23.815
Get out! Go on!

37:23.815 --> 37:25.775
Look...Flash...

37:28.403 --> 37:30.238
You are a dead man!

37:32.907 --> 37:35.451
I told you! It's Flash!
He's the killer!

37:35.451 --> 37:38.329
And he doesn't wanna kill you
about his songs.

37:38.329 --> 37:41.708
He wants to kill you
because of that girl, that Sandy!

37:41.708 --> 37:44.335
Al, you've been certain
about three different people!

37:44.335 --> 37:47.130
Yeah, but this time
I'm REALLY certain!

37:47.130 --> 37:49.215
And now you don't have to know
who to look for,

37:49.215 --> 37:53.219
because it's definitely HIM!

37:53.219 --> 37:55.555
Or...Dewayne.

37:55.555 --> 37:59.017
Or...or Philip.

38:00.893 --> 38:03.312

42:16.440 --> 42:18.317
So I took what was mine!

42:18.317 --> 42:19.401
Oh, yeah?!

42:19.401 --> 42:21.487
(SHOUTING)

42:30.412 --> 42:33.082
You should have let me kill him,
the bleeding twit!

42:33.082 --> 42:34.333
Oh, kill him? No, no, no.

42:34.333 --> 42:37.086
We should have killed him,
brought him back to life

42:37.086 --> 42:39.463
and killed him again
after what he did to us!

42:39.463 --> 42:42.633
What did he do? Oh, I mean
besides attack Tonic an' all?

42:44.093 --> 42:46.804
He stole our money,
you bleeding idiot!

42:46.804 --> 42:49.223
Right. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

42:49.223 --> 42:52.268
We can always make more money,
can't we?

42:52.268 --> 42:56.897
There's only one Tonic, right?
We don't wanna lose him.

42:56.897 --> 42:58.899
Thanks, Nick.
Yeah.

42:58.899 --> 43:01.318
I always knew
he was a shifty little twerp.

43:01.318 --> 43:03.195
And in my bleeding wig!

43:04.113 --> 43:05.948
We ought to kill him for that alone.

43:07.074 --> 43:09.285
You are one lucky geezer,
you know that?

43:09.285 --> 43:12.246
He's right.
It had nothing to do with luck.

43:12.246 --> 43:15.749
Actually, Philip...helped me out.

43:15.749 --> 43:17.793
Me?
Yeah.

43:17.793 --> 43:20.838
What the heck were you reaching for
in your pocket, anyway?

43:20.838 --> 43:24.216
I saw you, and then I saw somebody
else reaching in their pocket,

43:24.216 --> 43:27.219
and then you yelled,
and that made me jump back.

43:27.219 --> 43:30.389
And that's why Dewayne missed me.
If you hadn't done that , I-

43:30.389 --> 43:32.516
I wanted to give you this.

43:35.728 --> 43:36.562
Is this your mom?

43:37.730 --> 43:41.984
Yeah! And you! It was taken
after your first concert.

43:41.984 --> 43:44.111
(CHUCKLES) Not bloody likely!

43:44.111 --> 43:46.780
He was sick from drinking
too many vodka tonics on stage.

43:46.780 --> 43:50.534
He spent the night in the hospital
getting his stomach pumped.

43:50.534 --> 43:52.703
That's why we call him Tonic.

43:52.703 --> 43:53.954
AL: He's right, Sam.

43:53.954 --> 43:56.957
Tonic went straight from the concert
to the hospital.

43:59.168 --> 44:02.463
Look, Philip, I'm sorry.

44:02.463 --> 44:08.010
Oh, I remember her! She came with
you backstage before the concert.

44:10.763 --> 44:13.807
She was a bit of all right,
as I recall you telling me.

44:13.807 --> 44:15.267
Before the concert?

44:15.267 --> 44:17.644
He couldn't even stand
after the concert.

44:17.644 --> 44:20.481
Sam, if Tonic went bingo-bango-bongo
with Philip's mother,

44:20.481 --> 44:23.025
there's a 98% chance
that you're the father.

44:23.025 --> 44:26.820
Maybe...maybe I am your father.

44:29.490 --> 44:32.409
(LAUGHS) Hello, Dad!

44:32.409 --> 44:34.536
Good on you, Tonic!
Very nice!

44:34.536 --> 44:36.371
Oh, how sweet!

44:41.376 --> 44:42.836
Thanks.

44:45.756 --> 44:47.633
Wait. Where are you going?

44:47.633 --> 44:49.635
I just wanted to meet my father.

44:49.635 --> 44:51.637
I met you.

44:53.430 --> 44:54.556
Time to go.

44:54.556 --> 44:58.393
Wait a second. After all these years,
you don't have to go now.

44:58.393 --> 45:00.646
I told you.
I don't want anything from you.

45:02.940 --> 45:05.567
But if I stayed, what would I do?

45:05.567 --> 45:08.403
I hear you playing Tonic's
Stratocaster. You got good hands.

45:08.403 --> 45:10.531
Great hands.
Not as good as my dad.

45:10.531 --> 45:14.952
(CHUCKLES) Are you daft?
I've been carrying him for years!

45:14.952 --> 45:18.080
Haven't we all?
Oh, yes, indeed!

45:19.915 --> 45:21.917
What do you say,
maybe you stick around,

45:21.917 --> 45:23.710
and we'll get you a job as a roadie,

45:23.710 --> 45:26.255
and maybe you can teach your old man
some new licks?

45:26.255 --> 45:28.966
Maybe? I'd say you better!

45:30.801 --> 45:32.511
Huh? What do you say?

45:32.511 --> 45:34.763
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

45:36.765 --> 45:39.059
Sam, Tonic gives the kid a break,

45:39.059 --> 45:42.563
and the kid becomes one of the
hottest studio musicians in London.

45:44.231 --> 45:45.274
Ta-ta, Sam.

45:52.197 --> 45:56.535
MAN 2: 'Gordon? Gordon?
Damn it, Gordon! What's going on?

45:56.535 --> 45:58.537
Gordon? Are you there, Gordon?'

46:00.122 --> 46:03.083
Oh, God! Please help!
Help! Someone help me, please!

46:03.083 --> 46:07.421
Quick! I'm being kidnapped!
He's my ex-husband!

46:07.421 --> 46:10.632
He's gonna kill me! Please! Please!

46:10.632 --> 46:13.594
What are you doing
