00:38.929 --> 00:45.133
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, 
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me.

01:13.204 --> 01:17.336
In the beginning three were created

01:17.464 --> 01:20.457
Man; made of clay

01:21.110 --> 01:24.023
Angels; made of light

01:24.357 --> 01:28.358
And the third; made of fire...

01:28.601 --> 01:30.693
Called the "Jinn"

01:30.863 --> 01:36.267
Created with free will; this third race 
rule the world for thousands of years

01:37.302 --> 01:40.716
When man was given the dominion over the earth

01:40.764 --> 01:45.357
A sect of Jinn, known as Shiantii became resentful,

01:45.449 --> 01:49.035
Believing the sons of Adam were nothing more than savages,

01:50.317 --> 01:54.732
For centuries, the Shiantii have been laying in wait

01:55.110 --> 01:59.510
But there were a few who were watching....

01:59.838 --> 02:05.109
Guardians who sworn their blood line to protect men; and all that is good

02:05.649 --> 02:09.705
And ensure that darkness never over takes this world

02:13.350 --> 02:17.479
Man has all but forgotten that Jinn ever existed

02:17.600 --> 02:20.516
It's time for him to remember

02:25.249 --> 02:29.373
India, 1901

04:29.637 --> 04:32.585
God protect me from Satan the damned.

04:35.593 --> 04:38.127
God protect me from Satan the damned.

04:47.561 --> 04:50.297
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

04:51.957 --> 04:54.378
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

04:57.577 --> 05:00.001
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

05:03.427 --> 05:05.533
Duivelaanbidder ...(Cursed Devil)

05:05.708 --> 05:10.467
you have something that is not yours.

05:11.682 --> 05:14.900
And I'm here to get it back.

05:23.407 --> 05:28.141
You may keep your body. His soul is already dead.

05:28.206 --> 05:31.795
But give that girl back.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.722
God protect me from Satan the damned.

06:08.724 --> 06:11.691
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.859
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

06:14.893 --> 06:19.191
They bury this body in the name of the enemy.

06:19.255 --> 06:25.072
He belongs to me now

06:25.195 --> 06:29.329
Give her back and I leave you alone.

06:29.403 --> 06:32.494
You know I just want the girl.

06:32.607 --> 06:34.428
Jehangir...!

06:34.913 --> 06:38.649
Did you think, you could lure me into a trap?

06:42.424 --> 07:01.836
God protect me from Satan the damned.....

07:25.623 --> 07:30.946
Your God has abandoned you, man!

08:18.191 --> 08:20.093
Listen to my words:

08:20.094 --> 08:24.677
I'm going after the children one by one,

08:24.723 --> 08:26.895
Generation after generation,

08:26.897 --> 08:30.401
And murder them in your name!

08:30.434 --> 08:32.173
Asshole, son of a bitch...

08:48.361 --> 08:52.775
<<Thanks to Moonbeam for the original subs above>>

09:13.084 --> 09:19.558
Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gegenwart

10:39.626 --> 10:41.626
Hi, I am looking for a Mr. Amen

10:41.627 --> 10:45.796
Oh, you've got the wrong address; 
this is the Walker's resident.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.483
That’s right, Walker; sorry 
It has been a really long day.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.569
No signature required.

10:51.967 --> 10:55.415
Okay ... Thank you!

10:55.707 --> 10:59.770
- I think you've got a birthday present. 
- It's not my birthday!

10:59.772 --> 11:03.919
Someone think it is, and it's so pretty...

11:06.184 --> 11:11.699
- Who in the world wrapped this? 
- There is no name, no address...

11:11.701 --> 11:15.339
Come to think of it; I don't have to sign for it either.

11:15.411 --> 11:17.634
- Oh; Great. - Very strange.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.166
Happy Birthday, Shan

11:24.571 --> 11:28.696
Ok, this is bizarre. A VHS...?

11:29.018 --> 11:31.449
What if a dirty video?

11:31.914 --> 11:34.410
We sold our VCR, how are we supposed to watch it?

11:34.662 --> 11:38.796
- I had a VCR in my office. - Of course you did...

11:39.841 --> 11:44.702
No! No...No...No not again...! Oh Dinner!

11:51.014 --> 11:53.361
- You were not allowed to laugh. - Okay, I'm sorry.

11:53.363 --> 11:57.563
Let me take you out for dinner, you look beautiful tonight.
Please let me just show you off tonight.

11:57.619 --> 12:01.506
How have I done this again...? 
Ok; I can fix this...

12:11.646 --> 12:16.768
Oh, yeah that thing have been there for the past two days.

12:16.802 --> 12:20.065
It's kind of creeping me out, 
but I think it's just those cardboard cutter.

12:20.887 --> 12:22.411
Shawn...?

12:22.793 --> 12:24.359
Do you hear me, baby?

12:25.262 --> 12:26.849
Hello...?

12:54.323 --> 12:55.718
Honey?

12:57.644 --> 12:59.598
Oh Baby, are you okay?

13:01.086 --> 13:03.038
Its ok, you're safe.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.994
Someone house is burning.

13:07.456 --> 13:09.291
I heard my mother.

13:27.627 --> 13:29.122
Who's there?

13:31.665 --> 13:33.466
Who's there...?

13:40.864 --> 13:42.685
Gabriel...

13:42.908 --> 13:44.586
Thank God!

13:45.371 --> 13:48.955
- I thought it come early tonight. 
- Message have been delivered.

13:50.953 --> 13:54.073
- Thank you, Gabriel. 
- No need for thanks, Ali.

13:54.078 --> 13:55.872
It is important for all of us.

13:56.210 --> 14:01.034
You're right. Let's pray and believe it's.

14:04.477 --> 14:09.411
So Jess, get this, with all the orders we 
got for Firebreather this week,

14:09.555 --> 14:12.791
George said I could design the Firebreather 2

14:12.995 --> 14:14.807
And the best part

14:15.281 --> 14:17.377
He’s giving me that raise.

14:17.449 --> 14:19.694
Oh, I like George...

14:21.885 --> 14:23.549
So a...

14:25.978 --> 14:28.784
That conversation we had last week.

14:33.543 --> 14:35.894
I think we're ready,

14:36.285 --> 14:37.794
I think it's time.

14:40.707 --> 14:42.254
Jess...

14:46.576 --> 14:48.302
Hey, honey...?

14:49.992 --> 14:51.553
Jess?

14:55.376 --> 14:58.308
- Hey baby, are you okay? - Yeah. I'm ok.

14:59.176 --> 15:00.644
What's wrong?

15:04.425 --> 15:06.966
I have something I want to tell you but...

15:08.594 --> 15:10.225
I just don't know how...

15:11.184 --> 15:15.788
Ok whatever it is, we work it out, 
we work through, we always do...

15:22.175 --> 15:24.798
I can't have kids..., Shawn.

15:30.422 --> 15:32.263
What are you talking about...?

15:35.884 --> 15:38.848
I mean it's impossible, I can't have kids.

15:51.273 --> 15:53.045
How long did you know?

15:53.979 --> 15:55.866
Oh...Well...

15:57.394 --> 16:00.184
I know I should told you, but...

16:01.412 --> 16:03.893
I was afraid, if you knew...

16:04.253 --> 16:06.761
That you wouldn't want to be with me...

16:08.192 --> 16:10.331
Oh. I didn't want to lie to you...

16:58.613 --> 17:00.105
Shawn

17:01.512 --> 17:06.276
If you watching this right now...
Means we haven't seen each other for a very long time

17:06.509 --> 17:08.684
I'm very sorry about that

17:08.844 --> 17:13.272
Because it means you grew up just like I do,
without your father...

17:13.358 --> 17:18.980
But we don't have that much time 
And you really need to listen to me very carefully.

17:19.384 --> 17:22.589
Everything I've done and everything I'm about to do

17:22.656 --> 17:26.893
I did to protect you and your mother... 
always remember that...

17:28.580 --> 17:31.663
Strange things are gonna start happening to you

17:31.668 --> 17:33.863
Just like they happened to me

17:34.254 --> 17:39.361
There are things out there Shawn, 
I didn't even know existed.

17:39.772 --> 17:41.887
But they are real

17:41.904 --> 17:44.074
And they can be very evil...

17:44.353 --> 17:46.550
If this tape have found you...

17:47.254 --> 17:49.525
It means you have friends...

17:49.604 --> 17:51.214
Find them.

17:51.356 --> 17:55.097
Learn everything you need to learn and get stronger

17:55.676 --> 17:59.191
You have it in your blood Shawn, Just like I do

17:59.533 --> 18:01.944
But if you're watching this right now,

18:03.311 --> 18:06.300
It means I wasn't strong enough

18:08.085 --> 18:09.834
But maybe you are.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.519
That’s you,

18:21.480 --> 18:25.518
Hey buddy, how ya doin? Can I get a toy?

18:25.866 --> 18:27.585
Thank you

18:30.393 --> 18:32.135
I love you too

18:36.233 --> 18:39.149
I gave this to you on your last birthday

18:39.729 --> 18:42.235
I love you so much, Shawn...

18:43.619 --> 18:47.032
And I don't even know if you'll remember my face;

18:48.155 --> 18:50.731
Or if you remember who I am.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.762
But this is your father speaking; Shawn;

18:56.760 --> 19:00.365
And I'm telling you to fight it

19:00.657 --> 19:03.741
Fight 'till you can't fight it anymore

19:11.432 --> 19:13.755
For all the one I miss...

19:15.341 --> 19:17.426
Happy Birthday, Shawn

19:18.741 --> 19:20.596
And good luck....

19:45.997 --> 19:47.826
Hey honey it's me...

19:48.511 --> 19:51.450
I just watch the video...and duh....

19:52.204 --> 19:53.900
I gotta talk to you.

19:54.029 --> 19:55.778
I'm sorry.

19:56.508 --> 20:00.001
About earl... Just call me back, okay? 
Okay.

20:37.764 --> 20:39.229
Jasmine!

21:02.036 --> 21:05.717
Jas! Honey, can you hear me? 
Sweaty pick up the phone!

21:06.230 --> 21:09.708

21:09.794 --> 21:12.899
Jas, are you here? Sweetheart!

21:22.966 --> 21:24.738
911, what's your emergency?

21:24.743 --> 21:30.184
Yes... my wife is missing? My house has been ransacked 
I need an officer here now! Please...!

21:32.478 --> 21:38.738
Just so we're clear, there isn't anything missing,
In last you saw your wife a few hours ago?

21:39.187 --> 21:41.514
And this fight you have, it’s not physical right?

21:41.562 --> 21:45.338
I was upset, she was crying, I left...

21:45.730 --> 21:47.555
Hey, is that your wife?

21:48.212 --> 21:49.825
Oh my God....

21:49.861 --> 21:51.074
Shawn!

21:51.429 --> 21:53.438
Jasmine...

21:53.586 --> 21:56.430
I thought something happened to you, I kept calling...

21:57.114 --> 21:59.175
I was. I was... I went for a walk.

21:59.180 --> 22:03.382
I just came home, you weren't here,
I saw this, I freaked out

22:03.387 --> 22:05.524
- I'm so sorry, gentlemen ... - It's not a problem.

22:05.530 --> 22:08.348
Probably just a couple of drunk frat boys, 
nothing to worry about ok?

22:08.353 --> 22:09.568
Alright, you folks have a good night.

22:09.574 --> 22:12.070
- Goodnight. - Thank you.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.182
- You're okay? - Yes, I...

22:17.505 --> 22:19.680
- Did I leave the door open? - No...

22:19.772 --> 22:23.059
No, it was locked; 
they said its lock there is no force entry...

22:24.411 --> 22:25.829
I don't know.

22:31.081 --> 22:35.003
- Hey, no more call tonight? 
- Yeah, my thought exactly.

22:35.123 --> 22:37.695
Hey come here come sit for a sec.

22:43.558 --> 22:46.816
Shawn, you know I love you more 
than anything in this world.

22:46.872 --> 22:49.173
- I love you too babe. - And...

22:50.683 --> 22:54.166
Your happiness is my happiness...

22:56.690 --> 22:58.592
And so...

23:00.730 --> 23:03.387
Even if that means...

23:03.924 --> 23:07.149
That you're happy with somebody else...

23:07.209 --> 23:09.419
- Jas... - No, Shawn...

23:09.785 --> 23:12.089
You want a family!

23:12.394 --> 23:14.293
That’s ok.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.217
You will have...

23:18.221 --> 23:21.146
I wouldn't want to take it away from you...

23:23.584 --> 23:26.162
So I'm...

23:33.189 --> 23:35.762
- I know... - Always...

23:36.168 --> 23:37.644
You.

23:38.562 --> 23:40.298
Only you.

23:40.361 --> 23:41.761
I'm Sorry...

24:14.757 --> 24:16.129
Jas!

24:16.734 --> 24:18.679
- Jas!! - Baby...?

24:18.684 --> 24:20.131
Come here.

24:20.724 --> 24:22.818
- Come here. - Are you okay?

24:22.872 --> 24:24.584
Look.

24:25.395 --> 24:28.646
I came to get an orange juice, 
I don't know what's going on, baby.

24:28.744 --> 24:32.515
I don’t know what's going on. We put this all back, 
We put it all back!

24:35.497 --> 24:36.996
Shawn...

24:54.107 --> 24:57.593
Come on. Grab your stuff! Let's get out of here!

24:58.296 --> 24:59.586
Hello?

24:59.634 --> 25:00.948
Are you safe?

25:00.971 --> 25:02.310
Wowo... Who is this?

25:02.346 --> 25:04.398
Get to the Cathedral at Road Long Lake

25:04.404 --> 25:05.504
Who is this?

25:05.533 --> 25:08.275
Now's not the time. Get there now!!

25:31.391 --> 25:32.714
Shawn...

25:33.284 --> 25:34.733
Yeah...

25:35.456 --> 25:37.412
My name is Gabriel.

25:40.596 --> 25:42.130
Jasmine...

25:43.427 --> 25:47.359
Don't be afraid, you're safe within this wall.
They can’t get to you here.

25:47.364 --> 25:50.776
Wait. What? What can't get to us here?

25:51.805 --> 25:54.000
How do you know who we are?

25:54.222 --> 25:56.529
Can you please tell me what the hell is going on?

25:56.534 --> 25:59.357
Watch your language in my church, please...

25:59.623 --> 26:01.997
The Big Guy gets pissed.

26:02.539 --> 26:05.272
Ok, can somebody tell us what's going on please?

26:05.327 --> 26:08.669
- You watch the tape didn't you? 
- Yeah... Wait, how do you know about that?

26:08.674 --> 26:11.782
I'm was the one holding it for you all this years.

26:11.917 --> 26:16.011
- Ok yeah, well, but I don't believe it. 
- Then why are you here?

26:18.216 --> 26:21.114
- I don't know. - Yes you do.

26:21.893 --> 26:26.973
Your instinct brought you here. 
We can't help you on this unless you believe.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.847
Believe in what?

26:28.964 --> 26:32.852
You need to know who you’re fighting. 
So you can fight back.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.167
Ok...; how did you do that?

26:41.209 --> 26:45.273
Jas, tell me how most people would explain what just happened?

26:45.990 --> 26:48.857
Magic. That was a simple magic tricks.

26:48.887 --> 26:51.812
- A ghosts, I don't know? - Ghost...?

26:51.910 --> 26:56.410
Ghosts, demons, poltergeist... They don’t exist.

26:56.485 --> 27:01.805
Something else, the one solitary answer for everything 
You cannot explained.

27:03.084 --> 27:04.593
You see...

27:05.928 --> 27:09.558
In the beginning... Three were created.

27:09.706 --> 27:12.944
Man made of clay...

27:13.267 --> 27:16.113
Angels made of light...

27:16.373 --> 27:21.648
And the third, made of fire called the Jinn.

27:22.531 --> 27:24.797
That what's coming for you.

27:33.297 --> 27:38.352
Is he serious? I'm Sorry... Come on this is crazy.

27:38.377 --> 27:42.800
Ok. So, if these things are real, 
Then how come we've never even heard of them?

27:42.818 --> 27:46.760
Have you read the Torah Shawn?
Or as some people call it...

27:46.828 --> 27:50.418
The Old Testament. From the Prophet Ezekiel.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.696
"And out of the midst of the fire, came a 
Poor living creature with the likeness of men’s."

27:54.714 --> 27:59.496
"Their appearance was like burning coals of fire."
"At the centre of which looks like a molten metal."

27:59.520 --> 28:03.444
"And the living creature moved with the appearance 
Of a flash of lightning."

28:03.536 --> 28:05.745
They have been around for a long time.

28:05.868 --> 28:10.163
The Jinn were here first. 
And some of them want the world back.

28:10.267 --> 28:13.656
They're jealous of our imagination.

28:13.762 --> 28:17.045
Of our incredible capacity to create.

28:17.256 --> 28:19.003
Why do they after us?

28:19.045 --> 28:22.472
Within the Jinn there is a prophecy.
Very few of us know about it.

28:22.503 --> 28:24.655
But your great grandfather did.

28:25.016 --> 28:27.737
You're part of their prophecy.

28:27.896 --> 28:29.885
And they are afraid of you.

28:29.953 --> 28:32.077
This guys are crazy, Shawn. Come on let's go.

28:32.107 --> 28:36.753
Shawn, we can help you fight this.
You're gonna have to listen to us.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.969
Yeah, well...

28:40.009 --> 28:43.591
This isn't exactly the kind of help we looking for.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.047
Wait.

28:59.150 --> 29:00.871
Here.

29:02.825 --> 29:06.395
If you get into trouble, use it.

29:10.070 --> 29:14.585
OK great... Thank you. 
You can cut tomatoes with this.

29:14.659 --> 29:19.331
Remember... remember you're safe 
Within the walls of any house of God.

29:19.536 --> 29:21.198
Okay, thank you.

29:21.290 --> 29:24.407
Ask the Walkers about Father Westhoff.

29:25.585 --> 29:29.083
- What did you just say? 
- Ask the Walkers about me.

29:29.394 --> 29:33.160
Ma..! Dad..! It's Shawn, open up.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.351
Your father...

29:38.203 --> 29:40.962
Passed away a long time ago, Shawn.

29:41.229 --> 29:43.480
That tape was made 25 years ago.

29:43.629 --> 29:46.891
And he's saying stuff that doesn't make any senses.

29:46.965 --> 29:49.829
Then we went and met up with this two guys...

29:50.146 --> 29:55.155
They are telling us we're in great danger and a 
Bunch of other crazy shits that I’ve never even heard of.

29:55.184 --> 29:58.222
Shawn... Honey... I don't understand
What are you talking about now?

29:58.227 --> 30:00.720
Weird stuff is happening to us Ma, and...

30:00.746 --> 30:04.728
I don't know if it's a prank, 
Whether or not to believe these guys...

30:04.733 --> 30:07.132
- What weird stuff? 
- Our house was vandalised.

30:07.137 --> 30:10.646
- What? 
- There's this thing looking at us from another apartment.

30:10.651 --> 30:15.886
This tape comes out of nowhere and 
These guys telling us it’s all real and...

30:15.971 --> 30:18.953
- Something after us. 
- What... What after you?

30:18.958 --> 30:22.227
I don't know... arghh... Jinn.

30:25.437 --> 30:26.768
What?

30:28.697 --> 30:30.058
What?

30:30.118 --> 30:31.639
- You know what that is? - No.

30:31.681 --> 30:35.368
But the priest who arrange for us to adopt you...

30:35.421 --> 30:37.886
He made us promise that you will always wear your necklace...

30:37.928 --> 30:42.746
And there were something about a verse and the Jinn...
I don't know...

30:42.888 --> 30:45.330
I always thought it was a good luck charm, or something...

30:45.335 --> 30:47.581
- Okay, what is his name? - Westhoff.

30:47.897 --> 30:49.816
Father Westhoff.

30:52.263 --> 30:54.316
Shawn! Please don't go!

30:54.321 --> 30:56.873
Baby, my father told me to find the people who can help me.

30:56.878 --> 31:00.056
If what they are saying is true, I don't have much time.
We can keep talking about this.

31:00.061 --> 31:02.686
But we can run! Baby, we can hide it!

31:02.703 --> 31:05.459
- I'm not the type to hide, you know that. 
- Shawn!

31:06.019 --> 31:09.031
Please don't leave me.

31:10.382 --> 31:14.031
I'm never gonna leave you.

31:14.563 --> 31:16.308
I love you.

31:19.580 --> 31:20.763
I know.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.811
Jasmine!

31:24.485 --> 31:25.974
Jasmine!

31:29.796 --> 31:31.602
Jasmine!

31:33.521 --> 31:35.030
Jasmine!

31:36.454 --> 31:38.648
Jasmine...

31:43.536 --> 31:45.800
We're missing something, something big.

31:45.805 --> 31:48.673
I know. We can't keep him against his will.

31:48.714 --> 31:50.916
It is possible when the child is born.

31:50.964 --> 31:54.672
It's not what I expected... maybe...
It wants to end the blood line once and for all.

31:54.727 --> 31:57.541
I pray that is not the line prophecies

31:57.570 --> 32:01.944
- You've never been wrong all this years. 
- We are not wrong, Gabriel.

32:01.986 --> 32:04.499
He doesn't believe... He's going to die.

34:00.427 --> 34:05.442
The sons of Adam will fall...
The Jinn will rise...

34:05.503 --> 34:08.820
And this world will be ours again.

34:14.491 --> 34:19.123
No matter what I did you will not summit.

34:19.146 --> 34:21.114
You don't need to die...

34:56.815 --> 35:00.546
You say that... they would fear me.

35:01.416 --> 35:03.459
It didn't seem afraid.

35:04.301 --> 35:06.726
They are afraid of what you can become.

35:09.010 --> 35:11.106
What do you mean "What I could become"?

35:11.155 --> 35:16.679
There was a prophecy, recorded in a text called the "Jinn Scrolls".

35:16.833 --> 35:19.044
It was lost a long time.

35:19.273 --> 35:23.937
But it said that in a battle between man and Jinn

35:24.485 --> 35:29.256
One shall emerged more powerful than both.

35:29.953 --> 35:33.230
And will lead the world into a golden age.

35:35.747 --> 35:38.061
You think it talks about me?

35:39.172 --> 35:40.817
I do.

35:46.851 --> 35:50.271
Shawn! Where are you?

35:50.314 --> 35:53.908
Get out of the house, Shawn!

35:56.175 --> 36:00.683
Shawn, listen to me whatever you hear, 
Stay out of the house. I love you.

36:01.635 --> 36:04.700
I got him... Get out of the house!

36:16.289 --> 36:17.748
Shawn!

36:17.997 --> 36:19.309
Shawn!

36:19.756 --> 36:23.039
- You get a good sleep? - Hopping it's all a dream.

36:23.081 --> 36:27.417
I wish it was, but right now we are running against the clock.

36:27.509 --> 36:32.357
We need to get some more answer. 
And there's only one men who can help us.

36:33.840 --> 36:38.704
There is a sect of Jinn called Shiantii. 
Worshipers of Satan.

36:38.852 --> 36:41.021
The Shiantii are very powerful.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.227
Even the rest of the Jinn are afraid of them.

36:44.319 --> 36:46.735
If they are so powerful, how can I fight them?

36:46.771 --> 36:50.385
Men with strong will, heart and mind I can sense them.

36:50.465 --> 36:53.228
The strongest can fight them, and the strongest can...

36:53.233 --> 36:55.040
Destroy them...

36:56.208 --> 37:01.222
But the last one lived a hundred years ago. 
Jehangir Amin, your great grandfather.

37:01.470 --> 37:06.174
He tried to safe a girl, 
Who has taken by the same Shiantii that’s after you.

37:07.580 --> 37:10.028
- Cars fast. - Oh, Yeah.

37:10.072 --> 37:11.977
But can I outrun the Jinn?

37:14.186 --> 37:16.927
- How you doin? I came to see Ali Amin, room 413. 
- Signed here.

37:16.951 --> 37:18.777
- Step this way, arms up

37:20.523 --> 37:22.237
- All right Good.

37:22.956 --> 37:24.846
- Gentlemen, why don't you follow me...

37:34.310 --> 37:36.112
Shawn, come on.

37:37.446 --> 37:41.859
It is hard to believe that the one person 
Who could help us find Jasmine is in here.

37:41.932 --> 37:44.209
Well appearances can be deceiving.

37:44.251 --> 37:47.200
Hey, how do you do the thing with the pen?

37:49.247 --> 37:50.499
Magnet.

37:50.504 --> 37:53.595
Alright gentlemen, right this way.

37:57.906 --> 37:59.345
Follow me.

37:59.906 --> 38:02.264
I guess I remember this one, he's dangerous.

38:02.269 --> 38:05.617
Spook up a patients, so we have to put him in solitary.

38:05.665 --> 38:07.646
And we're right here in the right.

38:09.804 --> 38:11.528
Just bang the door if you need anything.

38:27.856 --> 38:29.745
He looks just like his father.

38:32.183 --> 38:33.715
Come here.

38:38.098 --> 38:39.625
It's okay.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.002
Sit down.

38:58.460 --> 38:59.996
Look too my eyes.

39:00.544 --> 39:05.202
I will hunt down your children, one by one,

39:05.207 --> 39:07.465
Generation after generation,

39:07.470 --> 39:11.415
And murder them in your name!

39:11.634 --> 39:13.094
I am

39:17.283 --> 39:18.936
Shawn...

39:18.942 --> 39:20.738
He looks just like his father

39:20.754 --> 39:22.682
He doesn't believe, he's gonna die

39:22.687 --> 39:25.135
Where does it come from for sure?

39:25.183 --> 39:27.131
But I don't have that much time

39:28.526 --> 39:31.836
Listen to me very carefully.

39:32.053 --> 39:34.053
Everything I've done...

39:35.125 --> 39:38.209
I did to protect you and your mother... 

39:38.500 --> 39:40.901
There are things out there Shawn...

39:42.080 --> 39:44.845
And it can be very evil

39:45.430 --> 39:49.221
You had it in your blood, Shawn, just like I do.

39:53.288 --> 39:57.509
You know that I love you more than anything in this worlds

39:58.926 --> 40:02.397
I'm Jasmine...

40:02.881 --> 40:06.816
And your happiness is my happiness. ..

40:07.892 --> 40:10.377
You want a family...

40:11.940 --> 40:15.145
I wouldn't want to take it away from you...

40:19.740 --> 40:22.037
What do you scared off...?

40:25.419 --> 40:29.068
Listen... Closely...

40:31.737 --> 40:34.033
Do you understand now?

40:35.381 --> 40:37.751
Did you hear the heartbeat?

40:38.079 --> 40:40.016
It came from inside

40:40.525 --> 40:44.018
The come for you because you have a child.

40:44.422 --> 40:47.697
Some of them you can see, the way I can.

40:47.939 --> 40:50.992
And they come, generation after generation

40:51.184 --> 40:53.161
Looking for the prophesied one.

40:53.184 --> 40:58.589
Caring the father, to wait and see if the son is the one they looking for.

40:59.251 --> 41:02.656
There are only a few bloodlines in the world who can fulfil the prophecy.

41:02.661 --> 41:07.002
No... That’s impossible. She told me she can't have children.

41:07.007 --> 41:11.402
She may not know... But make no mistake.

41:13.147 --> 41:16.887
She carries... your son.

41:19.546 --> 41:22.303
How much more time we waste?

41:22.420 --> 41:26.484
The boy must take the test! He must pass the Chilla!

41:26.561 --> 41:28.430
The test? What test?

41:30.672 --> 41:32.813
See what I see.

41:34.260 --> 41:36.067
Feel...

41:37.153 --> 41:39.194
What I feel.

41:57.397 --> 42:00.899
- Where am I? - A memory...

42:01.016 --> 42:02.970
Of an ancestor.

42:11.060 --> 42:16.206
- It feels so real... 
- Because it is. In your mind.

42:16.604 --> 42:19.771
There’s more than one dimension in this world.

42:19.838 --> 42:24.564
And you will need to move between them...
In order to pass the Chilla.

42:25.086 --> 42:26.926
So this is the test?

43:37.829 --> 43:40.462
Do not let fear overtake you.

43:40.554 --> 43:44.606
If you do, you will end up like me.

43:44.648 --> 43:49.254
I've failed my Chilla. I let them into my mind.

43:49.334 --> 43:52.273
And they've tormented me ever since.

43:52.521 --> 43:54.771
Because I tried to stop them.

43:54.776 --> 43:56.376
Stop them from doing what?

43:57.168 --> 43:59.090
From coming to you.

44:00.382 --> 44:02.056
Because, Shawn...

44:03.880 --> 44:06.876
I am a son of Jehangir too.

44:08.717 --> 44:10.631
I'm your uncle.

44:13.465 --> 44:17.560
- Why didn't anyone tell me? 
- He don't want you to see him like this.

44:18.627 --> 44:22.662
He’s been here since your parents died...
Waiting...

44:25.015 --> 44:26.548
Jasmine...?

44:27.017 --> 44:28.383
The baby?

44:28.463 --> 44:30.002
Yeah.

44:30.686 --> 44:33.480
You have to come here, and feel it for yourself.

44:34.491 --> 44:37.482
So, this Chilla... What if I fail?

44:37.545 --> 44:39.140
You cannot fail.

44:45.892 --> 44:47.483
Oh my God...

44:51.656 --> 44:53.209
They’ve been listening.

44:54.217 --> 44:58.792
Run! Get out of here! Both of you, Get the hell out!

44:58.815 --> 45:02.154
They've come! Run!!!

45:02.903 --> 45:05.193
Run!!!

45:05.458 --> 45:06.635
Come on!

45:06.640 --> 45:09.650
Run! Run!

45:14.091 --> 45:16.989
Run!!!

45:20.415 --> 45:21.989
Shawn, look out!

45:27.863 --> 45:29.827
Shawn, get out of here now!

45:48.821 --> 45:50.603
Don't stop, go!

45:51.816 --> 45:54.571
Listen, don't turn back, no matter what you see.

45:55.489 --> 45:58.050
Run! Go now!

45:58.267 --> 45:59.535
Go!

48:02.017 --> 48:04.938
Shit!

48:48.442 --> 48:50.649
Go!!!!

49:08.322 --> 49:10.987
"For our battle not against flesh and blood"

49:10.993 --> 49:13.493
"But against the lord and empires of this age".

49:13.498 --> 49:15.626
"Therefore put on the armour of God"

49:15.631 --> 49:20.106
"So that when the day evil comes,"

49:20.112 --> 49:21.977
"You may stand your grounds and after all has done"

49:25.786 --> 49:27.458
Father, what was he?

49:28.865 --> 49:30.976
Gabriel, is a Jinn.

49:31.869 --> 49:33.868
One of the few who work for humanity.

49:33.873 --> 49:37.456
Who do you think brought you to me? 
When your parents were killed?

49:40.075 --> 49:42.534
You have two choices.

49:42.654 --> 49:47.815
You can stay protected within the walls of the church,
Or you can end this.

49:48.734 --> 49:52.916
- How do I end this? 
- You are going to find out.

49:52.995 --> 49:57.154
The Chilla can allowed you to get 
Close enough to the Shiantii

49:57.159 --> 49:59.517
To exploit their weaknesses.

50:00.234 --> 50:03.171
The Chilla 
Is a window into their world.

50:03.225 --> 50:07.908
You can go where they go, 
See what they see, do what they do.

50:08.555 --> 50:10.370
Do you have the knife?

50:10.857 --> 50:12.068
Yes.

50:16.485 --> 50:20.266
This blade is made from the metal forged in Jinn fire.

50:20.545 --> 50:24.506
One of a few... like the pendant on your necklace.

50:24.554 --> 50:26.956
It doesn't fully exist in our dimension.

50:26.985 --> 50:29.808
But this can cut into theirs.

50:30.679 --> 50:33.934
But, before you can wield it properly,

50:34.907 --> 50:38.362
You will have to pass the Chilla.

50:38.941 --> 50:40.831
The Chilla is a test.

50:41.011 --> 50:46.064
Physical, mental and spiritual test.

50:46.131 --> 50:47.748
Of Fear.

50:48.146 --> 50:51.098
Of fears unique to you.

50:51.559 --> 50:53.969
Because they arises within you.

50:54.430 --> 50:56.553
From your own memories...

50:56.782 --> 50:58.995
From your own darkest thoughts.

51:00.606 --> 51:05.710
No one, not even me, can prepare you for what you will face.

51:05.871 --> 51:09.298
But there are some things that can help you.

51:10.390 --> 51:12.107
Please kneel

51:16.300 --> 51:17.840
Both knees.

51:21.102 --> 51:23.520
You will need Zamzam water.

51:24.578 --> 51:27.953
Holy water from Mecca, that saved the son of Abraham.

51:28.678 --> 51:33.581
Its power is a gift for men, 
But even diluted can harm those made of fire.

51:34.297 --> 51:37.366
For the Shiantii jinn, it is like poison.

51:38.267 --> 51:44.239
The verse on the Jinn written or spoken can weaken them.
You can trap them.

51:44.989 --> 51:50.970
Once you recite the verse... 
Exactly as I'm going to teach it to you, the Chilla will begin.

51:51.327 --> 51:52.774
And then what?

51:54.711 --> 51:56.544
And they will come.

52:00.487 --> 52:04.616
Find an uninhibited place where your mind can't be trick.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.789
Do not brake your concentration even for a moment.

52:08.022 --> 52:12.702
They will use everything you fear 
To keep you from completing your Chilla.

52:12.857 --> 52:17.031
To the Shiantii jinn, 
The weak mind are just flash and bones.

52:17.089 --> 52:20.117
But those that achieve a higher understanding...

52:20.289 --> 52:22.454
They are feared.

52:22.577 --> 52:26.537
If you awake from the Chilla 
With your mind intact,

52:26.778 --> 52:29.253
You’ll know what to do next.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.687
Oh shit...

55:04.625 --> 55:06.004
Oh shit...

55:17.477 --> 55:19.855
I know you don't want me to do this.

55:20.897 --> 55:23.928
So why not just leave us alone?

55:24.856 --> 55:30.516
I know you don't want me to do this. 
So why not just leave us alone?

55:30.652 --> 55:34.579
I will never leave you alone.

55:35.279 --> 55:39.791
I will hunt you down 'till the Day of Judgment.

55:39.889 --> 55:43.469
When this world will be ours again!

55:44.500 --> 55:45.945
Run!

56:14.205 --> 56:17.633
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

56:23.599 --> 56:26.995
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

56:27.912 --> 56:31.136
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

56:32.294 --> 56:35.617
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.166
Shawn?

56:45.627 --> 56:47.168
Hello?

56:48.165 --> 56:49.677
Shawn...

56:51.361 --> 56:53.802
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

56:53.937 --> 56:55.272
Shawn no...

56:57.180 --> 57:01.555
Oh God, please tell me you haven't started. 
Shawn baby, I escaped.

57:01.560 --> 57:05.230
Father Westhoff told me where you are,
You don't have to do this.

57:05.306 --> 57:08.263
Please, Shawn
They are way too strong for you.

57:10.940 --> 57:12.591
Oh my God...

57:14.001 --> 57:15.570
Something’s coming.

57:15.746 --> 57:17.810
Baby! Look at me!

57:18.010 --> 57:21.318
Look into my eyes - this is not a test.

57:21.319 --> 57:23.838
Please, look at me!

57:24.268 --> 57:28.822
O God, they are coming...! 
Please, Shawn, they're gonna kill us!

57:34.703 --> 57:36.703
Help me...

58:03.288 --> 58:05.999
Shawn, look what they've done to me...

58:06.910 --> 58:08.791
Look at me!

58:13.887 --> 58:16.706
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

58:24.268 --> 58:25.940
You're a coward...

58:26.447 --> 58:28.542
Just like your father.

58:37.348 --> 58:40.777
Look at what you've done to your child.

58:41.725 --> 58:43.444
Look...

59:05.152 --> 59:08.107
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:00:19.314 --> 01:00:21.154
Why are you doing this?

01:00:28.335 --> 01:00:30.455
Why are you?

01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:37.123
Everyone you loved is gone...

01:00:38.989 --> 01:00:41.707
And, just as in the beginning...

01:00:42.397 --> 01:00:44.650
There’s only me.

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:51.041
I've always been there.

01:00:52.377 --> 01:00:55.244
Always known what you could've become.

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:01.739
We could offer you so much more.

01:01:02.878 --> 01:01:05.357
You could be king...

01:01:06.527 --> 01:01:08.879
With a thousand heirs.

01:01:09.685 --> 01:01:12.690
From a thousand Jasmine.

01:01:18.778 --> 01:01:20.969
I only want one.

01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:23.976
Mine.

01:01:28.578 --> 01:01:30.387
Now where is she?

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.001
There is a war coming, Shawn.

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:49.002
Neither man nor Jinn could stop it.

01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:52.218
Maybe not.

01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:55.733
But I only want to stop you.

01:01:56.682 --> 01:01:59.151
You step out of your circle.

01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:07.104
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:25.248
You've come to play again.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.074
Oh no...

01:02:27.672 --> 01:02:29.580
Not tonight.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.346
My Chilla ends now.

01:02:39.787 --> 01:02:41.923
And tonight...

01:02:42.298 --> 01:02:44.522
You all fall.

01:03:28.088 --> 01:03:31.366
You’ll never see me.

01:03:31.454 --> 01:03:33.179
See if you can hide Jinn.

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:38.178
I show mercy, offered you power...

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.686
Now I give you death!

01:03:41.755 --> 01:03:43.157
Come and get me.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.572
My Lord, please protect this men.

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:03.747
I'll do my part so you can do Yours.

01:04:12.479 --> 01:04:14.539
Come alive and help me babe come on.

01:04:16.759 --> 01:04:18.554
Come on, he got nothing on us.

01:04:20.233 --> 01:04:22.532
Come on, show me some tricks baby, come on!

01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:25.487
You want some of me? 
Come get me.

01:04:26.552 --> 01:04:27.815
Come on!

01:04:37.299 --> 01:04:39.796
Come on, baby... Come on...
Hold it together.

01:04:44.287 --> 01:04:45.557
Come get me!

01:04:57.198 --> 01:04:58.405
So

01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:26.296
This fight is between your master and the boy alone.

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:30.871
I've wielded this against many of you over the years.

01:05:31.439 --> 01:05:33.077
Do you want to play?

01:05:58.635 --> 01:06:00.321
Let's finish this.

01:06:15.678 --> 01:06:17.781
Nice, Westhoff...

01:06:43.386 --> 01:06:46.416
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.009
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:25.584
Now, Shawn!

01:07:35.362 --> 01:07:37.792
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:42.161
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:07:44.429 --> 01:07:46.048
Shawn, hurry!

01:07:55.157 --> 01:07:56.569
Get that!

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:11.253
Dammn you! Come on!

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:23.563
Uncle!

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:10.017
Shawn...

01:12:48.746 --> 01:12:51.662
I seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan, the accursed one.

01:15:11.278 --> 01:15:12.455
Papa?

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:29.757
Wake up...

01:17:08.805 --> 01:17:11.792
Sons of Jehangir...

01:17:11.797 --> 01:17:15.677
You've made me an enemy of one of the Shiantii

01:17:15.819 --> 01:17:18.726
Do not make enemies of us all.

01:17:18.874 --> 01:17:21.075
You have the power...

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:25.036
But you're not an angel...

01:17:44.579 --> 01:17:46.667
Where’s my wife?

01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:51.726
Where’s my wife!?

01:17:54.478 --> 01:17:56.276
Okay who's next?

01:18:06.507 --> 01:18:08.149
Come on!

01:18:08.589 --> 01:18:10.222
Where is she?

01:18:12.879 --> 01:18:14.982
Where is my wife?

01:18:27.878 --> 01:18:29.356
Where is she...?

01:18:37.978 --> 01:18:39.366
Jasmine...?

01:18:41.388 --> 01:18:42.586
Baby?

01:18:43.821 --> 01:18:45.510
Come here.

01:18:55.087 --> 01:18:58.628
Look at you... Thank God.

01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:00.243
Babe.

01:19:11.958 --> 01:19:13.512
He done it for me didn't he?

01:19:13.537 --> 01:19:17.077
His job is to protect you and your son.

01:19:17.123 --> 01:19:19.398
No matter what the cost.

01:19:22.389 --> 01:19:26.481
If you knew we were hiding on, 
They would've known.

01:19:42.389 --> 01:19:43.990
I love you.

01:19:58.387 --> 01:20:02.971
A year later

01:20:04.442 --> 01:20:05.785
Everything is ready!

01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:09.976
- Oh Thank you, uncle; what can I do? 
- Oh I've got this.

01:20:10.001 --> 01:20:12.145
- A new recipe? 
- No actually, an old one.

01:20:12.203 --> 01:20:13.739
My brother thought me this.

01:20:14.369 --> 01:20:17.124
- Ahh... it’s for later, its dessert. 
- Ermmm... Fabulous!

01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:20.286
But not as sweet as you, my little ushiuu!

01:20:20.378 --> 01:20:22.574
Oh...okay...

01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:26.987
You're an angel, come look at you...

01:20:27.677 --> 01:20:30.401
Alright... 
You gonna have to teach me how to do this.

01:20:30.529 --> 01:20:33.329
I don't think Shawn liked the idea of his ​​mom cooking.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.525
Funny? I'm learning. You do not get a piece.

01:20:36.808 --> 01:20:38.699
My baby angel...

01:20:40.081 --> 01:20:42.218
- I'll get that. 
- I got it.

01:20:42.223 --> 01:20:43.877
Daddy got's it.

01:22:05.845 --> 01:22:09.048
I thought you gave that up. A long time ago...

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.867
Come across death made you think.

01:22:15.781 --> 01:22:18.154
You could have gone Christian you know?

01:22:20.496 --> 01:22:24.430
The point is... Something happen.

01:22:24.723 --> 01:22:27.180
There's something that wouldn't let me go.

01:22:27.522 --> 01:22:31.652
There's nothing strange about that.
I see that in my business all the time.

01:22:31.815 --> 01:22:33.282
I don't.

01:22:33.402 --> 01:22:35.440
You were guarding that boy;

01:22:35.734 --> 01:22:38.865
Since he was a child, without him ever knowing it.

01:22:39.214 --> 01:22:42.829
You think something is guarding you as well?

01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:44.912
Hard to believe.

01:22:45.238 --> 01:22:48.181
That's why we call it a "miracles".

01:22:58.615 --> 01:23:01.809
It's a good symbol, isn't it?

01:23:03.077 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah, it is.

01:23:05.217 --> 01:23:07.647
Well you earned it, Gabriel.
