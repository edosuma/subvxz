16:44.128 --> 16:45.963
You're leaving us a
hell of a hole, Jim.

16:46.047 --> 16:50.218
And we are up against
the big boys. We've got
Pitt, UCLA, Texas.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.678
You mean he's colored.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.222
He's a Negro, yes.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.099
You can't talk to Negroes?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.267
I can't...

16:59.477 --> 17:04.232
I'm not good at that salesman
stuff. Not much of a dancer,
you know that.

17:05.650 --> 17:10.154
I know this wasn't the most
welcoming place for you,
but that's not my fault.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.616
I can only control
what happens on 100
yards of gridiron.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.910
But I do know Cleveland never
would have heard of you

17:15.992 --> 17:18.704
if you hadn't come
here to play for me.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.045
What I did here
was on my back
and my sweat.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.422
What good would
your time be here

17:28.506 --> 17:32.093
if you're not willing
to help the next
kid get his chance?

17:33.636 --> 17:35.137
A kid like you.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.103
He's got talent, Jim.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.856
Maybe even your
kind of talent.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.736
Didn't mention
anything in your telegram
about bringing Jim Brown.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.197
I hope you don't
mind signing a couple
hundred autographs.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.783
Ha! Jim loves to sign
autographs, don't you?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.827
You know, Jim,
I'm a Syracuse
man myself.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.203
Class of '31.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.538
You don't say.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.543
Is that Bill Clark
from Notre Dame?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.753
MARTY: Yeah,
been here all week.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.966
Yeah, not enough
he steals Ramsey right
out from under my nose.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.802
That's your man
right there, Ernie Davis.

18:14.885 --> 18:17.847
11 varsity letters.
Plays baseball, too.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.309
In fact, there's not
a sport he doesn't play.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.476
(MARTY BLOWS WHISTLE)

18:22.560 --> 18:24.395
Try it one more time.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.023
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

18:42.663 --> 18:44.582
Let's see what he does.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.511
He's too fast
for these kids.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.096
He's too fast
for anybody.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.433
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

19:14.695 --> 19:18.491
Ben Schwartzwalder.
Head coach, Syracuse
University Orangemen.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.700
Pleasure to
meet you, sir.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.036
Pleasure to
meet you, son.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.789
Do you know
why I'm here?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.416
Same reason as
Notre Dame, sir?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.794
Yeah, same reason.

19:30.336 --> 19:34.423
But don't just take my
word for it. Jim! Jim!

19:35.091 --> 19:36.217
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.843
There's another fan
who'd like to tell you

19:37.927 --> 19:41.097
how much he'd
like to see you
come play for us.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.390
Jim...
Brown.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.893
2,091 rushing yards,
5.8 yards of carry,

19:45.976 --> 19:49.230
132 yards and
three touchdowns
in the Cotton Bowl.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.732
We lost the Cotton Bowl.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.610
But that sweep
where you cut
back to the middle?

19:54.693 --> 19:57.738
My mama and me watched
that game on a television
set in Sears and Roebuck.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.074
She's a big fan
of yours, too.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.409
Oh!

20:01.492 --> 20:02.743
Is she?

20:05.121 --> 20:07.748
Mr. Brown?
I hope you like
caramel cake.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.958
I do, thank you.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.126
Here you go.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.297
I understand you're
from Pennsylvania,
Mr. Davis.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.008
What brings you up
here to New York?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.760
I asked him to come.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.971
To help me make up my mind.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.641
That's good
to have family
like that.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.102
You close to your family,
Mr. Schwartzwalder?

20:28.185 --> 20:30.813
I have a wife
and two daughters.

20:31.147 --> 20:34.400
And they never ask my
opinion about anything.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.526
(ALL CHUCKLE)

20:35.609 --> 20:37.194
Seems to work.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.282
Mr. Brown?

20:41.365 --> 20:42.366
Yes, sir.

20:42.450 --> 20:45.161
Were you the first
in your family to
go to college?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.912
Yes, sir, I was.

20:48.330 --> 20:53.878
And what's it
like at Syracuse
for men like us?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.676
It's great.
It's good.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.937
I suppose I'd say
it's not that different
than a lot of places.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.901
This cake is delicious.

21:20.946 --> 21:25.910
BROWN: I want you
to go out. Keep going.
Back. Back. All right.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.121
Mr. Brown,
I'm not real
big on lacrosse.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.915
Jim.
Jim.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.667
Okay, let's see
what you've got.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.002
(GRUNTS)

21:35.836 --> 21:38.255
It's not as easy
as it looks, is it?

21:38.339 --> 21:39.340
I'm all right.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.719
You see, lacrosse
isn't just a sport.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.848
The Indians used it to
settle their conflicts
and heal the sick.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.935
They also played it as
a preparation for war.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.856
Make no mistake,
there's a war
in this country,

21:55.940 --> 21:58.984
but for men like us,
it's not on
the football field.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.613
So if all you nice folks
are offering the same thing,

22:02.696 --> 22:04.198
what makes you different?

22:04.281 --> 22:05.282
Well, Syracuse...

22:05.366 --> 22:07.284
Not Syracuse. You.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.037
I'm not sure I follow
you, Mr. Davis.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.291
My grandson might be
spending the next four
years listening to you,

22:15.626 --> 22:17.336
learning from you.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.340
So, I suppose
what I'm asking,
Mr. Schwartzwalder,

22:21.423 --> 22:25.135
is what kind
of man are you?

22:27.972 --> 22:30.558
I just want to be
the best player
I can be, you know.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.476
I want to be
like you, Jim Brown,

22:32.560 --> 22:35.813
first-team Ail-American
then straight to the NFL,

22:35.896 --> 22:39.858
and I need you to tell
me exactly where I
gotta be to get there.

22:40.526 --> 22:45.155
Look, if you go to
Syracuse, it's not
gonna be easy for you.

22:46.156 --> 22:49.493
But Schwartzwalder,
he's one of the best
coaches in college ball.

22:49.577 --> 22:53.372
Now you're fast,
but he'll make you faster.

22:53.956 --> 22:57.459
You run hard,
he'll show you
how to run harder.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.381
And you're good,
but he'll make you better.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.883
And if you ever
tell him I said that,

23:04.967 --> 23:09.388
I'll jump on the first
plane from Cleveland and
come and wring your neck.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.100
Now let's get out of here.

23:13.183 --> 23:17.813
Let me tell you something
about Jim and I, we had
our differences at times.

23:18.897 --> 23:23.360
So whatever he told you
about me, I would take it
with a grain of salt.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.324
Even if he said you
were a good coach?

23:29.199 --> 23:30.659
(SCOFFS)

23:30.743 --> 23:35.581
Well, in that case, son,
I would tell you that too
much salt is bad for you.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.402
Ernie? Ernie Davis?

24:05.736 --> 24:07.363
How'd you guess?

24:07.446 --> 24:08.530
Welcome.

24:08.614 --> 24:11.408
I'm Lew Andreas,
the athletic
director. Come on!

24:11.492 --> 24:13.786
I'll give you
a tour of the campus
on the way to your dorm.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.537
All right.
Syracuse has a storied

24:15.621 --> 24:17.623
academic tradition, Ernie.
Really?

24:17.706 --> 24:20.125
Steven Crane attended
the university in 1891

24:20.209 --> 24:22.836
and wrote <i>The Red
Badge of Courage...</i>
Hey, Lew!

24:22.920 --> 24:26.507
Harry! Sorry, I'll be
right back. Right back.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.884
Harry.
How are you?

26:14.990 --> 26:19.036
No one from here has
ever won, if that's
what you're looking for.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.207
No harm in dreaming,
right, Coach?

26:23.415 --> 26:27.294
It's not about
winning trophies, Davis.
It's about winning games.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.379
I'll see you at practice.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.967
Get up! Get up!

26:34.051 --> 26:36.845
That was plum awful!
Now, last one runs a lap.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.388
Let's go!

26:39.598 --> 26:40.808
Run a lap.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.059
ALL: ...five, six...

26:42.643 --> 26:45.395
Youmans, you move
like a walrus.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.315
Come on! Like a big,
old elephant walrus!

26:48.398 --> 26:51.318
Gerhard, goose-step.
Make your ancestors proud.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.903
Ease up, Davis.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.405
What are you smiling at?

26:55.489 --> 26:57.991
This fine institution
is giving you three
hots and a cot.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.327
I do not intend to let
them waste their money.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.870
Get them up, come on.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.080
Right about now,
I bet you're wondering

27:03.163 --> 27:04.998
what happened to
that nice gentleman
that visited your house

27:05.082 --> 27:07.084
and begged you
to come here, huh?

27:07.167 --> 27:09.837
Let's go! Now make
no mistake, gentlemen.

27:09.920 --> 27:14.591
No matter what anyone else
tells you, you are not here
to just play football.

27:14.675 --> 27:16.510
You are offside.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.012
BEN: You are here
at Syracuse
to win games.

27:19.096 --> 27:23.183
And you can't win
games if you can't
out-perform the other team.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.977
Don't you step on
my All-Americans.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.563
If you step on my
Ail-Americans, I will
reach down your throat,

27:27.646 --> 27:30.315
grab your donuts
and tie them to
your tonsils!

27:30.399 --> 27:31.525
Good hit!

27:31.608 --> 27:32.568
Take him down!

27:32.651 --> 27:34.903
So, you're the
next Jim Brown, huh?

27:35.237 --> 27:36.530
Yeah, I can see
the resemblance.

27:36.613 --> 27:39.283
Yeah, except Brown
was always mad
about something.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.618
(CHUCKLES) Don't be fooled
by the smile.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.036
Well, he's funnier
than Jimmy.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.121
Yeah.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.249
Well, maybe he
can entertain us.
You dance, Davis?

27:47.332 --> 27:49.084
Not as good
as me, Lundy.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.879
Come on! Get up!
Move! Move! Move! Move!

27:51.962 --> 27:54.214
SCHWEDES: You should
know, you never call
Coach, "Sarge."

27:54.298 --> 27:57.593
He was a captain,
jumped out of airplanes,
stormed a bridge in Normandy.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.803
Killed people,
won medals.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.264
By the way, I'm Gerhard
Schwedes, halfback.

28:02.347 --> 28:05.225
Roger, everybody calls
me Hound Dog though.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.269
Maury Youmans, center.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.314
I'll be keeping your
jersey clean next year.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.650
He embarrassed you!
Embarrassed you!

28:14.234 --> 28:17.112
BEN: I want you to move Davis
from freshman to varsity.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.907
But he won't be eligible
to play in any games, Ben.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.159
Why don't we just let
him catch his stride
with the other freshmen?

28:22.242 --> 28:24.661
First, when he does
become eligible next year,

28:24.745 --> 28:26.496
I want him to hit
the ground running.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.499
Second, he's gonna
raise everybody's game.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.835
He'll probably be
the best running back
they face all year.

28:31.919 --> 28:32.920
I got you.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.422
Third, that's just
the way I want it done.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.215
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

28:37.674 --> 28:40.928
Jack Buckley, right tackle,
sophomore. Call me JB.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.598
I was a defensive end
in high school. Philly.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.309
But I think they're
gonna move me to tackle.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.603
What we up to?
Three miles?

28:49.686 --> 28:51.271
Don't know.
Never count.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.814
You hear a train?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.274
Why?
Is it making
you nervous?

28:54.358 --> 28:56.652
No, I'm not nervous.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.779
Can we get off
these tracks?

28:58.862 --> 29:00.948
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just used to it.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.950
And when you use
your meal voucher
in the student union...

29:03.075 --> 29:04.952
Right.
...stay away from
the meatloaf.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.662
What else?
Girls.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.499
You'll find a Negro polar bear
before you find a Negro coed.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.711
Good morning, sir.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

29:16.463 --> 29:20.175
I swear, sometimes you feel
like you're on the moon here.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.554
SARETTE: Yes, yes,
that's her sister.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.474
Sarette, what did Petey
say about that broad?

29:27.557 --> 29:29.685
Yeah, it's her
little sister.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.480
I don't know about our
team yet, but theirs is
in mid-season form.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.524
At least her sister is.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.826
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

29:53.000 --> 29:54.459
ERNIE: Coach
wanted to see me?

29:54.543 --> 29:55.961
He's in his office.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.339
Knock.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.259
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

30:11.184 --> 30:13.353
You wanted to
see me, Coach?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.272
Mmm-hmm.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.941
Davis, my system
is simple.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.110
Conditioning,
teamwork.

30:20.193 --> 30:23.196
And on my team, I expect every
player to know his job.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.032
Know his place on the field.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.951
Quarterback,
running back,
lineman.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.663
That way, nobody
steps on anybody's toes.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.042
Same holds true
off the field.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.377
I'm not sure how
you mean, Coach.

its own 28-yard line.</i>

45:38.194 --> 45:39.278
QUARTERBACK: Hut!

45:39.695 --> 45:42.740
Let's get after it!
Come on, let's get after it!

45:49.622 --> 45:54.126
The receiver is leveled
by veteran linebacker
Bobby Lundy.

45:54.210 --> 45:56.253
I'm doing your job, 44.

45:56.337 --> 45:57.630
Huddle up!

45:58.381 --> 46:00.800
<i>Ball at the Syracuse
10-yard line.</i>

46:00.883 --> 46:04.095
<i>First down and goal
to go for Kansas.</i>

46:06.555 --> 46:07.974
Yes.
Did he get in?

46:08.057 --> 46:09.976
<i>Did he cross the goal line?</i>

46:10.059 --> 46:12.061
Here's the official signal.

46:13.229 --> 46:14.605
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

46:14.689 --> 46:15.856
Touchdown, Kansas.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.483
BEN: What kind of
pig slop is that?

46:17.566 --> 46:19.652
We haven't gotten
a call all day!

46:19.735 --> 46:22.363
<i>J ay hawks jump
out to a 7-0 lead</i>

46:22.446 --> 46:25.825
<i>here at the very,</i>
<i>very quiet Archbold Stadium.</i>

46:26.033 --> 46:29.996
Here in the second quarter,
Kansas on top of Syracuse,
7-0.

46:30.079 --> 46:31.080
SARETTE: Six regular!
Six regular!

46:31.163 --> 46:34.291
<i>The Orange faithful
still waiting for
something to cheer about.</i>

46:34.375 --> 46:35.459
Hut one!

46:37.420 --> 46:39.130
<i>Sarette back to pass.</i>

46:41.424 --> 46:43.134
<i>Throwing down fie Id.</i>

46:44.051 --> 46:45.845
<i>It's complete
to his tight end</i>

46:45.928 --> 46:48.014
<i>down near the
Kansas 30-yard line.</i>

46:48.097 --> 46:49.724
Way to pick up
the blitz, Ernie!

46:49.807 --> 46:53.185
A superb block on the play,
turned in by Ernie Davis.

46:53.602 --> 46:56.397
<i>Second down,
eight yards to go
for the Orangemen.</i>

46:56.480 --> 46:57.606
SARETTE: Hut!

46:57.940 --> 47:00.484
<i>Toss play once
again to Ernie Davis.</i>

47:03.320 --> 47:05.031
BEN: Get him out there!

47:06.032 --> 47:08.117
Daw's <i>to the
Kansas secondary.</i>

47:09.160 --> 47:10.703
Go, Davis, go!

47:13.205 --> 47:15.291
<i>Look at that young man go!</i>

47:17.084 --> 47:21.338
<i>The Elmira Express
virtually walks into
the end zone!</i>

47:22.173 --> 47:26.260
<i>The Syracuse Orangemen,
now on top of Kansas, 14-7.</i>

47:26.343 --> 47:27.678
Go for one.

47:27.762 --> 47:32.224
<i>And what an impression Ernie
Davis has made on this
crowd here at Archbold.</i>

47:32.725 --> 47:36.771
<i>The Orangemen
just may have found
their next great halfback.</i>

47:47.740 --> 47:48.783
Hey, Ernie.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.701
Hey, fellas,
how you doing?

47:51.327 --> 47:53.329
You guys
coming or going?

47:53.662 --> 47:55.581
Hey. Welcome home, Ernie.

47:55.664 --> 47:56.707
Pops!

47:56.791 --> 47:58.042
They give you
some time off?

47:58.125 --> 48:00.044
Yeah, yeah,
long weekend.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.254
Look at you,
all college boy.

48:02.338 --> 48:03.923
You're just gonna dirty
up my college jacket.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.925
Come on, come on,
let's go inside.
You're too good to hug me?

48:06.008 --> 48:06.967
Look at this!

48:07.051 --> 48:08.094
Let me carry that.
Give me your bag.

48:08.177 --> 48:10.471
If they'd run
you more last week
against Navy,

48:10.554 --> 48:12.431
you would have blown
them jokers off the field.

48:12.515 --> 48:13.808
Will, we won.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.976
Seems like that
coach of yours
like to pass the ball.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.561
I'll get my carries.

48:17.645 --> 48:19.939
Yeah? He promise you that?

48:20.689 --> 48:22.441
No. Thank you, ma'am.
But eventually...
No?

48:22.525 --> 48:24.026
How are your
grades, Ernie?

48:26.028 --> 48:27.530
Ernie?

48:27.613 --> 48:29.949
They're good, Pops, thanks.
I'm keeping them up.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.451
I like history,
and I'm taking
a business course.

48:32.535 --> 48:33.619
That's good.

48:33.702 --> 48:36.789
'Cause football
is just a game.

48:36.872 --> 48:39.583
It's that degree
that's going to
count for something.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.794
Gonna get you a good job.

48:41.877 --> 48:44.255
Where you gonna
get a good job at,
a Negro with a diploma?

48:44.338 --> 48:46.757
AT&T? GM?

48:47.258 --> 48:49.969
It's football
that's gonna
take him someplace.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.388
Otherwise,
he gonna be working
right here with us,

48:52.471 --> 48:53.764
cutting coal,
and you know it.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.057
I wanna apologize for him.

48:55.141 --> 48:56.725
You ain't got to
apologize for me, Pops!

48:56.809 --> 48:58.310
Don't you start
it tonight, Will.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.020
Pops... Guys!
Don't start
it tonight.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.397
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

49:01.897 --> 49:03.190
Relax.

49:03.649 --> 49:05.151
You're both right.

49:05.985 --> 49:09.071
Now, my plan A is the
Cleveland Browns. Now,
if that doesn't work out,

49:09.155 --> 49:11.407
plan B is the
New York Giants.

49:13.492 --> 49:16.203
Come on, Ernie.
We don't wanna be late.

49:17.079 --> 49:20.374
Sorry, my dear,
we got things to do,
people to meet.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.171
I'll meet you
outside, Ernie.

49:28.424 --> 49:32.511
MAN: Jim Crow
is alive and well right
here in Pennsylvania.

49:32.595 --> 49:33.637
MAN: Yes, it is.

49:33.721 --> 49:36.056
But we can no
longer willfully
close our eyes

49:36.140 --> 49:40.519
and pretend that we
cannot see that he sees
us as beneath him.

49:40.603 --> 49:42.521
WOMAN: Yes!
No, we cannot.

49:42.605 --> 49:47.193
And we can no longer
stay silent when he tells
us that we cannot speak.

49:47.276 --> 49:48.694
Yes!
That's right!

49:48.777 --> 49:51.739
Abraham Lincoln
stood in a field
at Gettysburg,

49:51.822 --> 49:53.782
and spoke of a new nation.
MAN: That's right.

49:53.866 --> 49:58.746
Uniontown is 100 miles away
from his Gettysburg.

50:00.039 --> 50:02.208
We are still
yet to be equal.

50:02.291 --> 50:08.797
That is why the NAACP is
calling for a nationwide
boycott of Woolworths.

50:09.298 --> 50:10.299
That's right!
That's right!

50:10.382 --> 50:12.009
All right.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.011
Come on.

50:15.679 --> 50:21.393
ALL: Boycott! Boycott!
Boycott! Boycott!
Boycott! Boycott!

50:21.477 --> 50:23.145
WILL: Come to Washington
with us.

50:23.229 --> 50:25.356
There's a bus going
down from the church.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.191
We gonna organize
with Martin Luther King

50:27.274 --> 50:30.402
and let the people
know this country
has got to change.

50:30.486 --> 50:32.738
I don't think I can be
a part of what you want
me to be a part of

50:32.821 --> 50:34.907
right now, Will.
All this.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.450
What you saying?

50:36.533 --> 50:37.868
I got a scholarship.

50:37.952 --> 50:41.705
I can't risk losing
it, and I don't wanna
invite trouble.

50:41.789 --> 50:44.750
I see. Did Emmett Till
invite trouble?
Did Rosa Parks?

50:44.833 --> 50:46.085
Who told you this,
your coach?

50:46.168 --> 50:47.378
You don't understand.

50:47.461 --> 50:49.088
It's a different
world up there.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.256
Is it?

50:50.506 --> 50:52.341
You know,
your coach sound
a lot like Pops.

50:52.424 --> 50:55.803
No understanding
whatsoever with the
troubles in this country.

50:55.886 --> 50:58.430
"You boys got no business
north of Union Street,
you hear me?"

50:58.514 --> 50:59.640
Now, leave Pops
out of this, Will.

50:59.723 --> 51:02.059
Now you got a white
man telling you what
you can and can't do.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.310
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Watch how you talk to me.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.645
That man don't care
nothing about you, Ernie.

51:04.728 --> 51:05.729
You're not there.
You don't know him.

51:07.189 --> 51:09.149
You don't know what
you're talking about.
Tom can toe the line

51:09.233 --> 51:13.237
and carry the ball,
but that man will turn
on you. Just you wait.

51:14.863 --> 51:18.784
You don't think I'm
reminded every minute
of who I am at school?

51:18.867 --> 51:22.997
Everybody there is
watching me, and waiting
for me to make a mistake.

51:23.872 --> 51:25.499
You Ernie Davis.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.669
You got your
name in the paper.

51:28.752 --> 51:32.006
Now that's something for
colored folk around here to
open up a newspaper, Ernie,

51:32.089 --> 51:35.050
and see your name,
your face.

51:36.719 --> 51:40.514
And say, "I know him.
I went to school with him."

51:41.181 --> 51:43.475
They gonna be
looking up to you.

51:43.559 --> 51:47.104
I think you owe them more
than just running a ball.

52:01.702 --> 52:04.121
SIMMONS: The play action
pass was there all day.

52:04.204 --> 52:05.956
It won't be
there the next time.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.207
Why not?

52:07.291 --> 52:11.295
'Cause Boston College
is watching the same
damn game that we are.

52:38.280 --> 52:42.534
All right, we start out
double tight. Tight in
here, tight in there.

52:42.618 --> 52:43.869
Just a normal
double tight.

52:43.952 --> 52:46.205
Just like from
the beginning
of time, Simmy.

52:46.288 --> 52:49.541
Now,
we're gonna take Schwedes
out of the wing position,

52:49.625 --> 52:52.336
and we're gonna
move him into a
three-back formation.

52:52.419 --> 52:54.713
Only shift it over like this.

52:54.797 --> 52:57.841
All right, defense.
What do you do
when you see this?

52:57.925 --> 52:59.760
Now the defense,
they have to shift.

52:59.843 --> 53:00.886
We move to the right.

53:00.969 --> 53:04.431
That's right. Even if
it's shading from nose
up to opposite shoulder.

53:04.515 --> 53:07.518
Our right tackle?
He goes on the left side.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.853
I'm gonna leave the huddle,

53:09.937 --> 53:13.190
and you're gonna
start out right,
just like normal.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.069
Go left, go left!

53:17.152 --> 53:19.196
<i>Except before we're set,
you're gonna run left.</i>

53:19.279 --> 53:20.280
He runs left,

53:20.364 --> 53:22.324
and you're gonna line
up on the left side.

53:22.408 --> 53:23.826
And he sets up
on the left side.

53:26.328 --> 53:29.081
And it's evident
that Boston College
is confused

53:29.164 --> 53:31.250
by the offense
Syracuse is running.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.585
You lost me, Ben.
The right tackle
moves to the left,

53:33.669 --> 53:34.878
he covers the tight end.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.589
But if he's on the left
side, we cover the tight
end, I can't pass to him.

53:37.673 --> 53:41.510
The Holy Cross defenders
are desperately trying to
position themselves

53:41.593 --> 53:43.387
<i>to best play against
this formation.</i>

53:43.470 --> 53:45.431
Petey, am I talking
French here?

53:45.514 --> 53:48.976
Tackle lines up
inside the tight
end, does he not?

53:49.059 --> 53:51.103
It's unbalanced, right?
Do we shift again, Coach?

53:51.186 --> 53:52.813
Yes, they shift.
They all shift.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.107
They have to shift.
They must shift.

53:55.190 --> 53:57.276
Shift, shift, shift.

53:57.359 --> 53:59.528
All right, so you've got
everybody and their dog

53:59.611 --> 54:01.488
shifted over to
the left. Now what?

54:01.572 --> 54:02.823
We are going to run it...

54:02.906 --> 54:04.241
We are going to run it...

54:04.324 --> 54:05.284
...to the right.

54:05.367 --> 54:06.910
...to the right.
To the right, Coach?

54:06.994 --> 54:08.454
But that's away
from our strength.

54:08.537 --> 54:09.788
The weak side of the field.

54:09.872 --> 54:11.790
So, we're going to
run to the weak side?

54:11.874 --> 54:14.418
I like the way that
you think, Mr. Davis.

54:14.501 --> 54:18.672
Gentlemen, when you have
a thoroughbred, you do
not lock him in the barn.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.174
SARETTE: Hut!

54:24.386 --> 54:27.389
I will take one-on-one
out here all day long.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.203
That just might
work, Coach.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.746
Damn right.

54:53.332 --> 54:57.085
"Ernie Davis is a bull-necked,

Okay, put that
away now, please.

Yeah.

didn't read the best part.

Ernie, you never
invite me to church.
Very funny, very funny.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.531
I'm hurt. What is that?
Ernie? Ernie.

55:25.614 --> 55:28.158
Can I have a word
with you, please?

55:29.326 --> 55:30.953
Make me some lasagna.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.440
the Orange Bowl in Miami

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.192
and the Cotton
Bowl in Dallas.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:42.530
Now, in Miami,
we would play Georgia,
ranked ninth in the polls.

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:48.494
And in Dallas, we would
play Texas, ranked second,
right behind us.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:55.334
If we win either
game, we will be
the national champions.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:59.505
Texas is the tougher
opponent, the tougher team.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:04.594
But to be the best,
I believe you have
to beat the best.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:11.726

know how I would vote,
but this is your vote.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.522

are the best team
in the nation.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.438

Now, some folks even think
that the only reason
that we are undefeated

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:12.828
is because we have not met
Clay Taylor and his teammates.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:18.084
I want everyone to
take a good long look
at what we're up against here

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:21.379

football is a religion.
