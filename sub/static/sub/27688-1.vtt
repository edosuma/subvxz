but a land from which
all dragons come.

13:47.988 --> 13:50.822
Even Night Furies?

13:50.824 --> 13:52.624
Especially Night Furies.

13:52.626 --> 13:55.061
Those are scary.

13:55.063 --> 13:56.596
Don't you worry.

13:56.598 --> 13:59.532
One day, I'll find
the Hidden World

13:59.534 --> 14:01.701
and seal it up,

14:01.703 --> 14:05.641
so that people and dragons
will fight no more.

14:16.150 --> 14:17.517
What?

14:18.953 --> 14:20.686
Oh, all right.

14:20.688 --> 14:22.989
You do know it's not
a chew toy, don't you?

14:22.991 --> 14:25.258
Is this what you want?
Oh, do you want this leg?

14:25.260 --> 14:27.763
Do you want my leg?
Go get it.

14:39.306 --> 14:42.143
Getting pretty good
at gliding on your own, bud.

14:55.256 --> 14:59.057
Oh, so this is where you come
to get away from Gobber.

14:59.059 --> 15:01.863
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:03.631 --> 15:06.097
Ugh.

15:06.099 --> 15:07.799
Well, he's right, you know.

15:07.801 --> 15:09.668
R-Really?

15:09.670 --> 15:11.770
You think you and I should...?

15:11.772 --> 15:13.038
Oh, gods, no.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.041
We're nowhere near
ready for that.

15:15.043 --> 15:17.043
No, that's-that's crazy.

15:17.045 --> 15:19.845
I mean, he's right
about all of this.

15:19.847 --> 15:23.982
It does seem like the
whole world knows about us now.

15:23.984 --> 15:26.351
Yep. And the more dragons
we bring back here,

15:26.353 --> 15:28.754
the bigger of a target
we become.

15:28.756 --> 15:29.989
Ugh.

15:29.991 --> 15:34.225
I just wish there was some way
to make them leave us alone.

15:34.227 --> 15:35.796
There might be.

15:37.899 --> 15:41.232
Dad used to talk about
an old mariners' myth,

15:41.234 --> 15:43.769
of a secret land
at the edge of the world

15:43.771 --> 15:46.038
where dragons live
totally out of reach.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.042
Well, sailors are
known for tall tales.

15:50.044 --> 15:53.078
True. But what if it's real?

15:53.080 --> 15:56.115
It could be the answer
to all of our problems.

15:56.117 --> 15:59.652
How? By moving
the dragons there?

15:59.654 --> 16:02.388
Uh-uh. All of us.

16:02.390 --> 16:04.222
Seriously?

16:04.224 --> 16:07.793
And abandon our home
of seven generations?

16:07.795 --> 16:11.197
The home your father left you to protect.

16:11.199 --> 16:12.764
Uh...

16:12.766 --> 16:14.899
Yeah, I think we need
a real solution, Hiccup.

16:20.642 --> 16:22.642
Well, we could just
take Gobber's advice

16:22.644 --> 16:23.875
and tie the knot.

16:23.877 --> 16:25.877
That should fix everything.

16:25.879 --> 16:28.780
But, hey, if you're having
doubts about yours truly,

16:28.782 --> 16:31.150
I'm pretty sure Snotlout's available.

16:31.152 --> 16:33.352
He only has eyes for your mom.

16:35.723 --> 16:38.657
- Playing dirty now, huh?
- You asked for it.

16:38.659 --> 16:41.160
Looks like there might be
a wedding after all.

16:41.162 --> 16:44.329
Oh, how dare you? That is a low blow.

16:44.331 --> 16:47.032
No, no, you are not
getting away.

16:47.034 --> 16:49.268
Okay, okay, you win, you win!

16:49.270 --> 16:51.836
You always win.

16:51.838 --> 16:53.705
You knew what you were
getting into.

16:53.707 --> 16:56.043
Uh-huh. Right.

17:01.782 --> 17:03.217
Uh, bud?

17:06.953 --> 17:09.954
What... Yeah, sure,
don't bother to wait for us.

17:40.088 --> 17:41.990
♪ ♪

19:02.970 --> 19:04.435
Oh, my gods.

19:04.437 --> 19:06.172
Uh, Hiccup!

19:06.174 --> 19:08.109
Oh!

19:12.346 --> 19:14.913
Yeah, yeah, w-we're friends.
No need to kill us.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.935
-: Wow.
- Another Night Fury.

19:36.937 --> 19:39.838
No, not quite.
It's more like a...

19:39.840 --> 19:42.607
- Bright... Fury.
- A Light Fury.

19:42.609 --> 19:45.310
Yeah, yours is better,
probably.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.614
<i>What do you mean, gone?</i>

19:48.616 --> 19:50.915
Vanished, into thin air.

19:50.917 --> 19:53.117
- What do you think?
- Uh-uh.

19:53.119 --> 19:54.987
Stubbier ears.
No dorsal plates.

19:54.989 --> 19:56.488
Okay. Got it.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.324
What a night.

19:58.326 --> 20:00.192
Bud, what's gotten into you?

20:00.194 --> 20:02.528
What is all this
slobbering and panting?

20:02.530 --> 20:06.899
Isn't it obvious?
He's in love.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.969
Trust me, relationships are
nothing but pain and misery.

20:11.305 --> 20:13.605
What did I just say?

20:13.607 --> 20:15.340
A-Am I not enough?

20:17.377 --> 20:19.278
I think that's a no.

20:31.091 --> 20:33.157
- Something like this?
- You know what?

20:33.159 --> 20:34.593
Just trace your Toothless card
and make her white.

20:34.595 --> 20:36.528
- You could've led with that.
- Can you believe it?

20:36.530 --> 20:38.529
Toothless has a girlfriend.

20:38.531 --> 20:40.566
I never took you
for a romantic.

20:40.568 --> 20:42.101
Like, ever.

20:42.103 --> 20:44.068
But it's so sweet.

20:44.070 --> 20:46.471
I mean, look.

20:54.214 --> 20:56.015
Okay. That's just sad.

20:56.017 --> 20:58.517
- And weird.
- Yeah, you better do something.

20:58.519 --> 21:02.121
Seriously? I'd rather shovel
poop all day than watch that.

21:02.123 --> 21:04.123
All right.
Let's head back to the woods

21:04.125 --> 21:05.559
and see if we can find her.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.229
Ah, good idea.

21:10.231 --> 21:11.563
A little privacy.

21:11.565 --> 21:13.298
- Uh...
- Shh.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.666
- It's boy talk.
- What?

21:14.668 --> 21:17.336
Come on,
let's go work this out.

21:17.338 --> 21:18.636
So, you want to get married.

21:18.638 --> 21:20.172
Uh, no, actually.

21:20.174 --> 21:22.074
Good news.
I've been to two weddings.

21:22.076 --> 21:25.944
I crashed both, but none
as high profile as this one.

21:25.946 --> 21:28.579
Lots of pressure, judgment,
and not just by me.

21:28.581 --> 21:31.115
Look, we talked about it.
We're not getting married.

21:31.117 --> 21:33.719
Cold feet.
I've seen it before.

21:33.721 --> 21:36.989
Don't worry, Little Hiccy.
I'm here.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.457
Wait, Hiccy?

21:38.459 --> 21:40.459
Now, I've seen the way
Astrid looks at you.

21:40.461 --> 21:41.993
Everyone has. That doubt.

21:41.995 --> 21:43.429
That not so subtle
disappointment.

21:43.431 --> 21:46.432
That longing for something
more than you.

21:46.434 --> 21:48.334
You need to focus on
being worthy.

21:48.336 --> 21:50.336
I mean, she's a warrior queen,
for Thor's sake.

21:50.338 --> 21:53.338
And you are neither.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.039
But with me as your best man...

21:55.041 --> 21:56.709
your spirit guide,
if you will...

21:56.711 --> 21:59.711
you'll learn to embrace
your inner Viking.

21:59.713 --> 22:01.713
Show these naysayers,
of which there are many,

22:01.715 --> 22:05.150
that you're more than
just a malnourished runt

22:05.152 --> 22:07.752
with bad hair, strange teeth,
and a twig for a neck.

22:07.754 --> 22:10.722
You're-you're
really bad at pep talks.

22:10.724 --> 22:12.691
Stop letting these insecurities

22:12.693 --> 22:14.292
get the best of you.

22:14.294 --> 22:16.461
Everyone's watching.
I mean, everyone.

22:16.463 --> 22:18.463
You need to man up.
Do as I do.

22:18.465 --> 22:21.567
It'll be hard,
but you have my word.

22:21.569 --> 22:24.737
And until I break that word,
I won't give up.

22:24.739 --> 22:26.637
Hey.

22:26.639 --> 22:29.441
Hey! What, am I wasting
my time here?

22:29.443 --> 22:33.114
You see some shiny thing in
the woods... Ooh, what is that?

22:42.490 --> 22:45.324
Toothless!

22:45.326 --> 22:47.058
Don't move a muscle.

22:47.060 --> 22:49.297
Hey!

22:58.039 --> 22:59.538
- Someone's here.
- Huh?

22:59.540 --> 23:01.205
He managed to slip
past our scouts

23:01.207 --> 23:02.673
and lay a trap in the woods.

23:02.675 --> 23:05.510
- It ruined boy talk.
-: Oh.

23:05.512 --> 23:07.779
- Gah, let me at him!
- Slow down, Gobber.

23:07.781 --> 23:10.615
Let's get a search team on
the ground, scouts in the air.

23:10.617 --> 23:12.651
Toothless and I
will fly the coastline.

23:12.653 --> 23:16.622
Yeah, I wouldn't advise taking
Toothless anywhere, Chief.

23:16.624 --> 23:18.790
I know this handiwork.

23:18.792 --> 23:22.126
Grimmel the Grisly.
Famous back where I'm from.

23:22.128 --> 23:24.430
The smartest dragon hunter
I ever met.

23:24.432 --> 23:26.531
Well, next to me, of course.

23:26.533 --> 23:29.734
Well, he can't be that smart.
He left his trap unmanned.

23:29.736 --> 23:34.073
Nothing's accidental
when it comes to old Grimmel.

23:34.075 --> 23:35.740
He lives for the hunt,

23:35.742 --> 23:37.742
to get inside the mind
of his prey,

23:37.744 --> 23:40.211
to control its every choice.

23:40.213 --> 23:41.779
It's all a game to him.

23:41.781 --> 23:43.714
Well, he doesn't know
who he's playing with.

23:43.716 --> 23:45.717
Yeah. Well, we've dealt with
his kind before.

23:45.719 --> 23:47.752
Don't underestimate him,
Hiccup.

23:47.754 --> 23:50.489
Mark my words.
He'll be back.

23:50.491 --> 23:53.094
Then we'll be waiting for him.

24:06.373 --> 24:07.839
All right.

24:07.841 --> 24:10.241
All right, come on,
give me a clue here.

24:10.243 --> 24:12.414
Give me a clue, Dad.

24:33.367 --> 24:36.236
Oh, I hope you don't mind
if I help myself.

24:38.239 --> 24:40.175
This is, uh, mmm, quite good.

24:41.876 --> 24:45.280
Oh, that is impressive.
But let me finish my drink.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.117
Toothless!

24:53.287 --> 24:55.621
What did you do to him?

24:55.623 --> 24:58.557
Eh, nothing
that he won't sleep off.

25:01.794 --> 25:03.162
May I?

25:03.164 --> 25:04.297
Chief Hiccup.

25:04.299 --> 25:08.333
Hmm? Do I say Chief
or do I call you Hiccup?

25:08.335 --> 25:09.604
What do you prefer?

25:11.405 --> 25:16.307
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

25:16.309 --> 25:18.176
Oh.

25:18.178 --> 25:20.412
Well, your father knew of me.

25:20.414 --> 25:23.315
Now, there was a chief.

25:23.317 --> 25:27.920
One of the greatest dragon
hunters to have ever lived.

25:27.922 --> 25:30.489
What would he think of you?

25:33.927 --> 25:35.626
He had it right, you know.

25:35.628 --> 25:37.628
Making it his mission
to destroy the beasts

25:37.630 --> 25:39.897
so that you could grow up
in a better world.

25:39.899 --> 25:41.866
He changed his mind.

25:41.868 --> 25:44.238
And look where that got him.

25:45.739 --> 25:48.941
So let's get to the point.

25:48.943 --> 25:51.643
I am the Night Fury killer.

25:51.645 --> 25:56.214
I've hunted
every last one but yours.

25:56.216 --> 25:58.817
You are going to give me
that dragon, or I will...

25:58.819 --> 26:00.719
I will never give him up.

26:02.889 --> 26:07.728
You wish dragons to live free
among us like equals?

26:09.597 --> 26:11.797
A toxic notion, my boy.

26:11.799 --> 26:15.433
History has shown that we are
the superior species.

26:15.435 --> 26:19.904
What if word of your
misguided ideas were to spread?

26:19.906 --> 26:23.008
It would be the undoing
of civilization

26:23.010 --> 26:26.545
as we know it.

26:26.547 --> 26:28.482
Hmm.

26:32.319 --> 26:34.556
Did we get him?

26:36.723 --> 26:37.692
Now!

26:39.827 --> 26:41.393
Sorry to barge in.

26:41.395 --> 26:44.328
You think you can
come into my home,

26:44.330 --> 26:48.499
sit in my father's chair,
and threaten my dragon?

26:48.501 --> 26:50.469
This is Berk.

26:50.471 --> 26:53.971
And we have defended our way of
life from far worse than you.

26:53.973 --> 26:55.740
Ooh.

26:55.742 --> 26:58.676
A fighting spirit.
I love it.

26:58.678 --> 27:02.013
Only I'm afraid
you're mistaken.

27:02.015 --> 27:05.651
You've never seen
anything like me.

27:14.728 --> 27:15.930
Astrid, look out!

27:23.037 --> 27:25.037
Look out! Son, get clear.

27:27.374 --> 27:29.309
Run!

27:36.649 --> 27:38.950
Have my dragon ready

27:38.952 --> 27:43.958
when I return, or I will
destroy everything you love.

27:51.565 --> 27:55.400
- Grab the buckets!
- How did this happen?!

27:57.338 --> 27:59.337
- Inside.
- It's the middle of the night.

27:59.339 --> 28:01.605
- What are we doing here?
- All right.

28:01.607 --> 28:04.378
All right, everybody.
Settle down, please.

28:05.511 --> 28:07.412
Fishlegs.

28:07.414 --> 28:09.847
Have you ever seen
that species of dragon before?

28:12.720 --> 28:13.785
Let me at him!

28:13.787 --> 28:15.619
I'll give him
a piece of my mind!

28:15.621 --> 28:18.423
And by mind, I mean fist!

28:18.425 --> 28:20.925
Did you miss the part
where we almost died?

28:20.927 --> 28:23.561
Have you seen my house?

28:23.563 --> 28:26.030
This is a new kind of enemy.

28:26.032 --> 28:28.700
And I underestimated him.
Now, that's on me.

28:28.702 --> 28:30.701
But I will not do that again.

28:30.703 --> 28:33.939
We're Vikings.
We don't run from a fight.

28:33.941 --> 28:36.040
At least, I don't.
You might.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.909
I agree with Hiccup.

28:37.911 --> 28:39.911
We haven't seen
the last of Grimmel.

28:39.913 --> 28:42.814
He's a predator,
single-minded and patient.

28:42.816 --> 28:44.982
He won't stop
until he gets what he wants.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.084
I'm with Eret.

28:46.086 --> 28:49.086
We have to take
this threat seriously.

28:49.088 --> 28:51.088
Grimmel is just
a sign of the times.

28:51.090 --> 28:54.526
Our enemies are getting
smarter, more determined.

28:54.528 --> 28:58.963
We're not just overcrowded.
We are exposed and vulnerable.

28:58.965 --> 29:02.567
Short of full-blown war
and risking everyone we love,

29:02.569 --> 29:05.836
I don't...

29:05.838 --> 29:09.173
I don't see a way
of staying here any longer.

29:09.175 --> 29:10.942
What would Stoick think of this?

29:10.944 --> 29:13.513
Hey! Hear him out!

29:19.586 --> 29:22.921
If we want to live in peace
with our dragons,

29:22.923 --> 29:24.955
we need a better plan.

29:24.957 --> 29:27.659
So what are you saying, Chief?

29:27.661 --> 29:29.827
I'm saying
we have to disappear.

29:29.829 --> 29:31.762
Off the map.

29:31.764 --> 29:34.999
Take the dragons to a place
where no one will find them.

29:35.001 --> 29:37.001
And where might that be?

29:37.003 --> 29:39.837
He's talking about a quest
for the Hidden World.

29:39.839 --> 29:40.705
The hidden what?

29:40.707 --> 29:42.840
Out to lunch. - Yeah.

29:42.842 --> 29:45.844
My father was obsessed with it
when I was a boy.

29:45.846 --> 29:47.612
He made notes and maps

29:47.614 --> 29:51.450
in search of the ancestral home
of all dragons,

29:51.452 --> 29:54.685
tucked away somewhere
beyond the edge of the world.

29:54.687 --> 29:56.821
It may be the solution we need.

29:56.823 --> 29:59.657
We are dragon people.

29:59.659 --> 30:01.759
It's where we belong.

30:01.761 --> 30:05.763
Look, I know this is our home.

30:05.765 --> 30:08.532
My father left me
to protect it.

30:08.534 --> 30:11.536
But Berk is more
than this place.

30:11.538 --> 30:13.471
We are Berk.

30:13.473 --> 30:15.105
The people, the dragons.

30:15.107 --> 30:18.876
I say Berk is wherever we go.

30:18.878 --> 30:20.211
I don't know.

30:20.213 --> 30:21.579
What do you think?

30:21.581 --> 30:24.583
I'm with him! Who else?!

30:24.585 --> 30:26.585
♪ ♪

30:43.669 --> 30:45.069
Excuse me. Coming through.

30:45.071 --> 30:47.172
Just, let me just
get right through here.

30:47.174 --> 30:51.009
Fishmeat, look, eat your rocks.
Eat your rocks.

30:51.011 --> 30:53.511
Gods! People who fly
with babies are the worst.

30:55.682 --> 30:58.249
I feel like I'm always asking
you this question, but...

30:58.251 --> 31:00.251
Wake up, Grump! Wake up!

31:00.253 --> 31:02.653
Is there an actual plan or...?

31:02.655 --> 31:05.757
Just keep flying until
we reach the end of the world.

31:05.759 --> 31:08.226
Ah. Seems sensible.

31:08.228 --> 31:11.028
<i>So, where are they?</i>

31:11.030 --> 31:12.963
Gone. Obviously.

31:12.965 --> 31:15.099
The Night Fury escaped you?

31:15.101 --> 31:17.269
- Again?
- I encouraged it.

31:17.271 --> 31:20.704
They've abandoned
their only defensible position.

31:20.706 --> 31:22.307
<i>Running scared</i>

31:22.309 --> 31:24.709
<i>with what little
they can carry.</i>

31:24.711 --> 31:26.611
It just keeps going.

31:26.613 --> 31:29.314
That's 'cause the world
is actually round.

31:29.316 --> 31:30.915
The sun's round. The moon is round.

31:30.917 --> 31:32.284
Stars are round.

31:32.286 --> 31:34.118
Even though
they're small and stupid.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.154
Right? Stars.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.324
Don't fret.
They won't get far.

31:39.326 --> 31:42.594
The Night Fury is distracted.

31:42.596 --> 31:46.298
I introduced him
to your female.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.299
<i>Furies mate for life, you see.</i>

31:48.301 --> 31:51.169
What you picking up on, bud?

31:53.272 --> 31:54.772
The Light Fury!

31:54.774 --> 31:56.173
- She's following us!
- Wow!

31:56.175 --> 31:58.175
Cool.

32:00.213 --> 32:02.212
- Would ya look at that?
- Where'd she go?

32:02.214 --> 32:04.182
Is she made of sky?

32:04.184 --> 32:06.521
Whoa! Hold up, Toothless!

32:12.925 --> 32:15.326
Well, look who it is.

32:15.328 --> 32:18.028
Uh...

32:18.030 --> 32:19.663
Oh, hey, it's really nice
to finally...

32:31.144 --> 32:34.346
This is perfect. So great.

32:34.348 --> 32:36.183
Not a word.

32:39.019 --> 32:40.986
<i>Y-Yes, yes,
but where did they go?</i>

32:40.988 --> 32:43.622
I have to explain this.

32:43.624 --> 32:46.290
Night Furies can't survive
in the cold,

32:46.292 --> 32:47.526
so they haven't gone north.

32:47.528 --> 32:49.627
<i>They're trying to put distance
between themselves</i>

32:49.629 --> 32:50.996
<i>and enemies to the east</i>

32:50.998 --> 32:52.329
and south.

32:52.331 --> 32:54.164
<i>And Night Furies cannot fly</i>

32:54.166 --> 32:57.902
<i>long distances without rest.</i>

32:57.904 --> 33:00.372
Their flight path
must include stops.

33:00.374 --> 33:01.776
Potty break!

33:03.676 --> 33:06.411
<i>Therefore, they've gone...</i>

33:08.415 --> 33:11.184
<i>They can only have gone...</i>

33:13.252 --> 33:16.721
<i>Does anyone want

33:20.159 --> 33:22.292
Ah, east!

33:22.294 --> 33:24.029
West.

33:24.031 --> 33:26.865
Hmm? Simple, you see?

33:26.867 --> 33:28.866
Oh, isn't this fun?

33:28.868 --> 33:31.035
Yes? No?

33:32.705 --> 33:35.006
Yes. Yes.

33:35.008 --> 33:37.341
Where is your love of the hunt?

33:37.343 --> 33:39.877
I thought you were conquerors.

33:39.879 --> 33:42.080
You'll have your prize in time.

33:42.082 --> 33:47.051
Just allow me a few more days
to enjoy this.

33:47.053 --> 33:49.053
I have dearly missed it.

33:49.055 --> 33:50.689
<i>All right.</i>

33:50.691 --> 33:52.857
Looks like we're camping here
for tonight.

33:52.859 --> 33:54.825
Well, thank Thor for that.

33:54.827 --> 33:56.828
Yes. My own place.

33:56.830 --> 34:00.198
I plan to build a hut,
only for the bearded.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.066
Ruffnut, you got to stay out.

34:02.068 --> 34:03.868
Chin whiskers don't count.

34:03.870 --> 34:07.071
I see a tower of
manliness in the shape of me.

34:07.073 --> 34:10.308
It's gonna be taller than Eret
with bigger muscles.

34:10.310 --> 34:11.842
W-What?

34:11.844 --> 34:13.944
- Get out of my house!
- Hey.

34:13.946 --> 34:15.978
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

34:15.981 --> 34:17.281
Ever since you showed up,

34:17.283 --> 34:18.850
you've been trying
to upstage me.

34:18.851 --> 34:21.051
You're just so jealous.
It's delusional.

34:21.053 --> 34:22.953
Yeah, delusion's
a good word for it.

34:22.955 --> 34:24.487
Listen, son of Eret.

34:24.489 --> 34:26.924
When Hiccup blows it as chief,
I'm next in line.

34:26.926 --> 34:29.326
Number two, 'cause
I'm clearly Valka's favorite.

34:29.328 --> 34:32.263
So, you better start
showing me some respect.

34:33.431 --> 34:34.966
Strange little man.

34:34.967 --> 34:36.734
Ah, don't mind him.

34:36.735 --> 34:40.071
It's not your fault you have
the body of a Norse god.

34:40.072 --> 34:42.107
I myself have the same problem.

34:43.310 --> 34:45.243
This one's mine.

34:45.245 --> 34:47.946
Blacksmith's stall
goes right here.

34:48.947 --> 34:51.315
One, two, three, four, five.

34:51.318 --> 34:53.951
- Where's...? Oh.
- Uh, okay.

34:53.953 --> 34:56.353
Uh, hold on, gang.
I-I said make camp.

34:56.356 --> 34:59.424
- Did you see them?
- Not build a new village.

34:59.426 --> 35:01.325
Who died and made you chief?

35:01.327 --> 35:03.995
What? Ow!

35:03.997 --> 35:06.330
Granted, this place
is very nice,

35:06.332 --> 35:08.500
but it's not the Hidden World.

35:08.502 --> 35:11.502
We don't even know
if this Hidden World exists.

35:11.504 --> 35:14.772
Yeah. This place is real.

35:14.774 --> 35:16.540
Eh, there's nothing
more stubborn

35:16.542 --> 35:19.144
than a mob of
tired, hungry Vikings.

35:19.146 --> 35:23.214
Well, I guess this can
work as a base in the meantime.

35:23.216 --> 35:26.250
It's defensible, hidden.

35:26.252 --> 35:28.520
All right. You can stay.

35:28.522 --> 35:30.254
Say hello to New Berk!

35:30.256 --> 35:32.122
Let's get building, lads.

35:32.124 --> 35:34.526
Until Toothless and I
find the Hidden World.

35:34.528 --> 35:37.060
Get off it!

35:37.062 --> 35:38.529
Now, about that voice.

35:38.531 --> 35:42.000
Can we lose the whole
honking goose thing?

35:42.002 --> 35:44.234
It's hard to imagine
wedded bliss

35:44.236 --> 35:47.171
with that going off
every minute.

35:47.173 --> 35:49.040
If you're going
to continue west,

35:49.042 --> 35:51.341
I should head back to make sure
we weren't followed.

35:51.343 --> 35:53.578
Great idea. I'll go with you
for protection.

35:53.580 --> 35:57.214
No! You're far
too important here.

35:57.216 --> 35:59.484
Yeah.

35:59.486 --> 36:01.451
Just be careful.

36:01.453 --> 36:02.953
Look at this place!
It's amazing!

36:02.955 --> 36:04.855
- That's a nice rock.
- What?

36:04.857 --> 36:09.127
This plan to hide us
from the rest of the world.

36:09.129 --> 36:11.029
Though-though I wish
it were possible,

36:11.031 --> 36:13.564
I fear it can't last, Hiccup.

36:13.566 --> 36:17.334
I mean, you know I tried
to do the same for years.

36:17.336 --> 36:22.439
But greedy humans
always find a way.

36:22.441 --> 36:26.044
I just... I only ask
that you think about it.

36:26.046 --> 36:27.377
This one's mine.

36:27.379 --> 36:29.346
I threw my axe down first.

36:29.348 --> 36:31.982
Do you still think
I'm crazy or...?

36:31.984 --> 36:36.386
Let's just say
this whole idea is very you.

36:36.388 --> 36:38.555
Well, thanks for
supporting me last night.

36:38.557 --> 36:40.091
It meant a lot.

36:40.093 --> 36:42.627
Don't thank me yet.

36:42.629 --> 36:44.595
I just hope
you're right about this.

36:44.597 --> 36:48.067
- I like it here.
- I always wanted a sunset view.

50:57.249 --> 50:58.915
if she's right for us?

50:58.917 --> 51:00.917
- Us?
- You know what I mean.

51:00.919 --> 51:03.787
She's so wild and skittish.
I'm just gonna say it.

51:03.789 --> 51:04.955
I don't trust her.

51:04.957 --> 51:07.758
Can't tame 'em all, Hiccup.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.259
One day, you'll have to snip
those apron strings

51:10.261 --> 51:12.428
and let Toothless
stretch his wings.

51:12.430 --> 51:15.499
Reminds me of a talk I had
with Stoick about you.

51:17.803 --> 51:19.736
Where do they keep coming from?

51:19.738 --> 51:22.305
- Who?
- Those bloody Hobgobblers.

51:22.307 --> 51:24.941
I swear they're popping up
faster than rabbits.

51:24.943 --> 51:26.944
I think they want to eat me.

51:26.946 --> 51:29.145
Evidence would suggest
I'm tasty.

51:29.147 --> 51:30.814
Hiccy, a moment?

51:30.816 --> 51:33.816
Listen, I've been
watching you walk.

51:33.818 --> 51:35.886
Lose the limp.
No one's gonna marry that.

51:35.888 --> 51:37.754
I have a prosthetic leg.

51:37.756 --> 51:39.923
- So have I.
- And I have a parasitic twin,

51:39.925 --> 51:42.325
but you don't see me
limping around about it.

51:42.327 --> 51:45.328
Come on. Chin up, Hiccy.
Puff out that chest.

51:45.330 --> 51:47.930
Move that butt to the left a little bit.

51:56.107 --> 51:58.875
Mom, are you hurt?
W-What happened out there?

51:58.877 --> 52:01.145
I don't know how,
but Grimmel is tracking us.

52:01.147 --> 52:05.015
Ah! This is all because
of the Hobgobblers.

52:05.017 --> 52:07.116
He has a hundred ships,
maybe more,

52:07.118 --> 52:10.120
with enough cages
for all of our dragons.

52:11.457 --> 52:13.156
If Grimmel is
leading them here,

52:13.158 --> 52:15.225
we have to take him
out of the mix.

52:15.227 --> 52:18.060
Uh, and how would we do that?

52:18.062 --> 52:20.062
By going there to capture him.

52:20.064 --> 52:22.232
Capture him?

52:22.234 --> 52:24.170
I'm with him! Who else?!

53:10.850 --> 53:14.551
: Okay, split up.
We'll be harder to catch.

53:14.553 --> 53:17.120
I was thinking we should
split up, just because.

53:17.122 --> 53:19.355
I like your instincts.

53:19.357 --> 53:21.091
What is this?

53:45.050 --> 53:46.986
♪ ♪

54:00.198 --> 54:03.066
Shh! Shh! Quiet.

54:03.068 --> 54:04.634
- Quiet.
- Where's your dragon

54:04.636 --> 54:07.571
when you need him, hmm, Chief?

54:07.573 --> 54:11.174
Must have forgotten
all about you.

54:11.176 --> 54:13.243
First rule of the hunt:

54:13.245 --> 54:15.678
separate the prey
from its pack.

54:15.680 --> 54:19.683
You've just removed yourselves
from the equation.

54:19.685 --> 54:21.584
- Why are you doing this?
- Really?

54:21.586 --> 54:24.388
I didn't think you cared.

54:24.390 --> 54:27.156
Well, unlike you,
when I was a boy

54:27.158 --> 54:31.227
and I came upon a Night Fury,
I killed it where it slept.

54:31.229 --> 54:35.665
That simple act of courage
made me a hero in my village.

54:35.667 --> 54:39.201
So I decided
to kill every last one,

54:39.203 --> 54:42.673
bringing real peace
to the people of this world.

54:42.675 --> 54:44.674
Until you came along,

54:44.676 --> 54:47.944
preaching that dragons
are something other than

54:47.946 --> 54:50.113
thieves and murderers.

54:51.450 --> 54:54.984
That nonsense dies now,
starting with you.

54:54.986 --> 54:57.287
But you have dragons of your own.

54:57.289 --> 54:59.388
: These?

54:59.390 --> 55:01.390
They're dragon killers,

55:01.392 --> 55:04.660
drugged into obedience
with their own venom.

55:04.662 --> 55:07.997
Not even your precious alpha
could control them.

55:07.999 --> 55:11.334
They serve me and only me.

55:11.336 --> 55:13.703
Allow me to demonstrate.

55:13.705 --> 55:15.504
Take cover!

55:19.678 --> 55:21.477
Split up!

55:21.479 --> 55:22.915
Whoa!

55:28.086 --> 55:30.022
Whoa! Run!

55:48.006 --> 55:49.608
Up here!

56:05.457 --> 56:07.393
Hurry!

56:09.327 --> 56:11.294
Go, go, go, go, go!

56:13.298 --> 56:14.566
Hiccup!

56:19.805 --> 56:21.470
Gotcha.

56:21.472 --> 56:23.140
Go, Cloudjumper!

56:28.446 --> 56:30.446
Yeah!

56:30.448 --> 56:32.385
Our hero!

56:44.196 --> 56:45.562
Hmm.

56:45.564 --> 56:48.334
Ugh, he takes
that stupid baby everywhere.

56:53.671 --> 56:55.372
God almighty!

56:55.374 --> 56:57.307
Guess we won't be
needing this then, huh?

56:57.309 --> 56:59.575
I led us right into his trap.

56:59.577 --> 57:02.779
Yeah, nice work, Chief.
Right, Ruff?

57:02.781 --> 57:04.314
Wait.

57:04.316 --> 57:05.781
- Uh...
- Where is Ruffnut?

57:05.783 --> 57:07.651
We-we left her behind?

57:07.653 --> 57:09.685
How could you not notice
she was missing?

57:09.687 --> 57:11.520
You ride a two-headed dragon.

57:11.522 --> 57:12.689
Oh, yeah.

57:12.691 --> 57:15.792
I feel like how Ruffnut is
- dumb.

57:15.794 --> 57:17.627
Odin be spanked!

57:17.629 --> 57:19.729
This just gets
better and better.

57:19.731 --> 57:21.263
Any more fantastic news?

57:21.265 --> 57:22.598
I try to avoid looking at her.

57:22.600 --> 57:24.133
It gives me acid reflux.

57:24.135 --> 57:26.336
O-Okay, guys,
just keep your helmets on.

57:26.338 --> 57:27.803
Toothless and I will find her.

57:27.805 --> 57:29.738
Toothless has
the Light Fury now.

57:29.740 --> 57:31.508
He's probably
not even coming back.

57:31.510 --> 57:32.741
What?

57:32.743 --> 57:34.743
You gave him
his freedom, Hiccup.

57:34.745 --> 57:36.645
What were you expecting?

57:36.647 --> 57:38.515
I never thought
he'd stay away for good!

57:38.517 --> 57:41.250
I-I...

57:41.252 --> 57:44.656
Look, I'll-I'll figure it out.
I just need more time.

57:46.258 --> 57:49.191
He thinks he has to lead alone.

57:49.193 --> 57:52.729
Well, because
his father had to.

57:52.731 --> 57:56.332
He doesn't realize
the strength you have together.

57:56.334 --> 57:59.736
- Do you still believe in him?
- Of course.

57:59.738 --> 58:01.537
I wish he did.

58:01.539 --> 58:05.908
But he thinks he's nothing
without Toothless.

58:05.910 --> 58:08.580
Then help him
realize the truth.

58:13.218 --> 58:14.383
- Get on.
- What?

58:14.385 --> 58:15.618
We're going to find him.

58:15.620 --> 58:17.854
Really?

58:17.856 --> 58:21.158
Everybody, stay put.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.859
We will get Ruffnut back.
Don't worry.

58:23.861 --> 58:25.529
Worry?

58:25.531 --> 58:28.330
If they're stuck with Ruffnut,
I'm more worried about them.

58:30.234 --> 58:33.736
Why the long face?

58:33.738 --> 58:35.805
I mean, mine's long,
but yours is really long.

58:35.807 --> 58:38.575
All face and no brain, like
you got stretched at birth.

58:38.577 --> 58:40.176
Do you have a twin, too?

58:40.178 --> 58:41.912
Tuffnut took up all the room
in Mom's belly.

58:41.914 --> 58:43.779
Otherwise I'd have
a rounder head and more brains.

58:43.781 --> 58:45.915
That's science.

58:45.917 --> 58:48.317
My braids are like
little Zipplebacks. See?

58:50.321 --> 58:52.689
Even the mold spots
look like eyes. It's so cute.

58:52.691 --> 58:54.390
They even have
little horns and everything,

58:54.392 --> 58:55.725
just like Barf and Belch.

58:55.727 --> 58:57.426
Except me and Barf
can't stand Belch,

58:57.428 --> 58:58.627
so they're really just Barfs.

58:58.629 --> 58:59.696
It's warm in here.

58:59.698 --> 59:01.865
I know what you're thinking.

59:01.867 --> 59:04.667
You've never had
a prisoner this hot.

59:04.669 --> 59:06.468
All the boys love me.

59:06.470 --> 59:08.604
Except Eret,
who totally lost his chance.

59:08.606 --> 59:10.640
That ship has sailed, boy.
Sorry.

59:10.642 --> 59:11.975
And Hiccup is
practically married

59:11.977 --> 59:13.142
to that round-head, Astrid.

59:13.144 --> 59:16.513
But Snotlout and Fishlegs,
they're basically my harem.

59:16.515 --> 59:18.915
I just can't choose, you know?

59:18.917 --> 59:21.517
Snotlout's a beefcake but
almost too pretty, you know?

59:21.519 --> 59:23.852
Sometimes I think he's more
in love with himself than me.

59:23.854 --> 59:27.223
There's only room for one
beauty in this relationship.

59:27.225 --> 59:29.792
Fishlegs would keep
me alive longer if I had to

59:29.794 --> 59:31.627
eat one of them, stranded
on some glacier somewhere.

59:31.629 --> 59:33.430
But he never shuts up about dragons.

59:33.432 --> 59:34.830
Don't you hate
when people never stop talking?

59:34.832 --> 59:36.732
- Yes, I do.
- They just keep going and going.

59:36.734 --> 59:39.236
Blah, blah, blah.
It's so boring.

59:39.238 --> 59:41.238
- Can't we just feed her to your dragons?
- I'm hungry.

59:41.240 --> 59:42.638
Hey, what do you have
to eat around here?

59:42.640 --> 59:43.906
I'm allergic to fish.
You should know that.

59:43.908 --> 59:47.243
That's all they have
at that stupid new island.

59:47.245 --> 59:48.812
Do you have any clams?

59:48.814 --> 59:50.647
They're like little mouths
with slimy food inside

59:50.649 --> 59:52.749
that's already chewed,
like the way Mom used to do it.

59:52.751 --> 59:55.919
- Enough!

59:55.921 --> 59:58.354
Until I turned 12 and she was
like, "Chew your own food."

59:58.356 --> 59:59.923
And I was like,
"No, I kinda like it."

59:59.925 --> 01:00:02.658
Most annoying creature
ever to cross my path.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.461
Aw.

01:00:04.463 --> 01:00:07.564
Oops, you let the dragons out.

01:00:07.566 --> 01:00:09.432
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

01:00:09.434 --> 01:00:11.267
- No, this one's gonna get you.
- Get...

01:00:11.269 --> 01:00:13.602
Take him and go!

01:00:13.604 --> 01:00:16.339
Please! I beg you!

01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:18.741

Ew, you feed
your dragons dragons?

01:00:22.013 --> 01:00:24.314
- Go!
- Where's your bathroom?

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:25.415

01:09:35.999 --> 01:09:38.000
See, everyone thinks
Tuffnut's more annoying, but...

01:09:38.002 --> 01:09:40.303
- Wait, hold on.
- Ruffnut, focus.

01:09:40.305 --> 01:09:42.170
Were you followed?

01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:44.240
I never look back, Hiccup.

01:09:44.242 --> 01:09:46.341
Toothless.

01:09:46.343 --> 01:09:48.844
Toothless!

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:01.793
Toothless, come back!

01:10:10.235 --> 01:10:11.570
No!

01:10:28.218 --> 01:10:33.054
And now our little game
must come to an end.

01:10:37.328 --> 01:10:39.194
Call them off, alpha!

01:10:39.196 --> 01:10:41.999
No reason for her to die, too.

01:10:55.212 --> 01:10:56.478
What are they doing?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.215
- They could totally take him.
- Not with her life on the line.

01:11:03.421 --> 01:11:04.987
Save your breath.

01:11:04.989 --> 01:11:08.291
The only alpha
they respond to is me.

01:11:13.263 --> 01:11:15.197
Oh...

01:11:15.199 --> 01:11:18.099
don't feel too badly.
You tried your best.

01:11:18.101 --> 01:11:23.005
But you are nothing
without your dragon.

01:11:38.088 --> 01:11:39.455
Toothless!

01:11:57.374 --> 01:11:59.608
Oh, that is
just great!

01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:00.776
Now what?

01:12:00.778 --> 01:12:04.346
I think it's time for number
two to become number one.

01:12:04.348 --> 01:12:06.284
He'll listen to you.

01:12:11.288 --> 01:12:13.555
- Don't say it.
- I wasn't going to.

01:12:13.557 --> 01:12:15.291
I shouldn't have
dragged you out there.

01:12:15.293 --> 01:12:17.526
He wouldn't have flown me back.
She wouldn't have followed.

01:12:17.528 --> 01:12:19.527
Yep.

01:12:19.529 --> 01:12:22.497
I feel like the same screwup
I was before I met Toothless.

01:12:22.499 --> 01:12:24.332
I can see that.

01:12:24.334 --> 01:12:26.501
Are you just gonna stand there
and agree with everything?

01:12:26.503 --> 01:12:27.335
Well, you're right.

01:12:27.337 --> 01:12:30.171
You're back
to where you started,

01:12:30.173 --> 01:12:32.508
but I was the first
to believe in you.

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:34.210
And I have watched you doubt

01:12:34.212 --> 01:12:36.679
whether you're worthy
ever since.

01:12:36.681 --> 01:12:38.514
But you know what?

01:12:38.516 --> 01:12:42.385
I am the person I am today
because of you.

01:12:42.387 --> 01:12:45.453
I never told you that,
but it's true.

01:12:45.455 --> 01:12:48.157
You are the bravest,
most stubborn,

01:12:48.159 --> 01:12:52.161
most determined knucklehead
I know.

01:12:52.163 --> 01:12:54.429
Toothless didn't
give you that, Hiccup.

01:12:54.431 --> 01:12:57.767
- He just made it...
- Easier.

01:12:57.769 --> 01:13:01.370
And now it's gonna be
a lot harder.

01:13:01.372 --> 01:13:04.807
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

01:13:04.809 --> 01:13:07.542
Probably something stupid.

01:13:07.544 --> 01:13:10.315
That's the Hiccup I know.

01:13:13.418 --> 01:13:16.318
Suit up, gang.
We're going to get them back.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.321
- What?
- He's lost his mind.

01:13:19.323 --> 01:13:22.425
Now, that's marriage material.

01:13:22.427 --> 01:13:25.661
At last, faithful pupil,
you are ready.

01:13:25.663 --> 01:13:30.832
Um, how are we gonna get our
dragons back without dragons?

01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:32.201
Trust me.

01:13:35.806 --> 01:13:38.273
- Watch yourselves.
- You're next.

01:13:39.843 --> 01:13:41.210
Move it.

01:13:44.082 --> 01:13:46.348
Um, that's right, alpha.

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:48.320
No surprises.

01:13:56.694 --> 01:14:02.264
So, jump off the cliff
in these.

01:14:02.266 --> 01:14:03.765

01:14:03.767 --> 01:14:06.568

the best I've got.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.837
Aw.

01:14:08.839 --> 01:14:10.605
- I'm with him! Who else?!
- I'm with...

01:14:10.607 --> 01:14:12.640
Ruffnut, that was my line.

01:14:12.642 --> 01:14:14.643
- Let's go!
- Try to keep up!

01:14:18.783 --> 01:14:20.349
Yeah! - Yeah!

01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:23.118
- I'm doing it!
- All right! - Oh!

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.385

01:14:33.196 --> 01:14:35.497

hand you the Night Fury,

01:14:37.668 --> 01:14:38.666

01:14:38.668 --> 01:14:40.368

what I started.

01:14:44.876 --> 01:14:49.210
Best of luck controlling them
without an alpha.

01:14:49.212 --> 01:14:51.482
Hold on, Toothless!

01:14:54.918 --> 01:14:57.286
Let go!

01:14:57.288 --> 01:14:58.786

some practice!

01:15:39.363 --> 01:15:42.197
