It’s a pattern we’ve found
sometimes with people
who are addicted to opiates.

because you see it over and over
from your friends and family.

I have to know she loves me

and took their
two-year-old daughter.

for a huge settlement.

You’re gonna be rescued

- [jered] Yeah?

Can you trace the line?

Guys, talk to me.
/need to know
why we got cut 0/5?

We got men down there.
We need to communicate with them.

[Man On Radio]
All right. Give us a minute.
We ’re working on it.

13:25.639 --> 13:30.303
Can you rewind it back to
the point where they’d just been
told they were gonna be rescued?

13:30.394 --> 13:34.979
[Man On Radio: Indistinct ]
As soon as we get anything,
we 7/ let you know

13:39.861 --> 13:43.445
Now, these two men
are showingjoy and relief.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.902
All right.
C an you freeze it there?

13:51.623 --> 13:56.117
Can we push in on this man?
Okay.

That’s concealed fear.

Well, he’s buried under
50 tons of concrete and steel.
What the hell were you expecting?

Relief.
I don’t expect a man...

14:11.852 --> 14:14.889
who’sjust been told
he’s gonna be rescued
to show fear,

14:14.980 --> 14:17.437
and everyone else
is showing relief.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.640
Maybe he doesn’t believe
he can be rescued.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.522
Posttraumatic stress
can stiﬂe almost
any positive emotion.

14:22.612 --> 14:28.403
Maybe, uh, Mr. Blunt...
doesn’t want to be rescued.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.530
Who wouldn’t want to be rescued?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.408
Someone who
caused the collapse
in the first place.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.879
You think Blunt
might’ve intentionally
caused the collapse?

14:46.970 --> 14:50.713
Well, that would explain
the look of fear.
Best explanation we’ve got.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.391
- This is unbelievable.
- How long hasjered Blunt
worked for you, Mr. Warren?

14:54.519 --> 14:57.932
About six months.
Any problems? Did he threaten
violence against the company?

14:58.023 --> 15:00.639
Yeah. He confronted me
akwﬁma.

15:00.734 --> 15:04.443
In fact, he sent
a threatening letter to my office
complaining about overtime.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.521
- Why didn’t you fire him?
- Well, believe me, I tried.
The union blocked me.

15:07.616 --> 15:10.983
Why would Blunt
sabotage the building
while he was still inside?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.990
Well, maybe he got
trapped down there.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.497
Can you replay
the video again?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.701

Burn marks from an explosion.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.929
- Damn.
- What’s wrong?

15:33.016 --> 15:36.099
Blunt could ’ve used explosives
to tiy to blow up the building.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.435
That could ’ve caused
the collapse.
[Stevens] If he did this,

15:38.522 --> 15:40.808
he could be trying
to sabotage our
rescue efforts too.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.015
There could be more
explosives down there.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.771
What about my other guys?
We need to get them out ofthere.

15:44.861 --> 15:48.274
They’re trapped right here
in the northwest quadrant.

Ifthey could get across
to the elevator shaft here,

15:50.992 --> 15:52.903
they’d be protected
from another explosion.
No way.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.280
This ﬂoor’s too unstable
to get there.
They’d never make it.

[Ste vens ]
We ’re getting ready to send
rescue workers down there.

I can’t move forward.

Dr. tightman,
can you find out
from Blunt...

16:02.295 --> 16:04.547
if he did this
so we know if it’s safe
to get these men down there?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.963
Ifyou could get
the live feed back up,
I could talk to him directly.

Well, we have to get it
back up then.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.259
We won ’t get anything
from Blunt that way

He ’5 not gonna admit to
b/o Wing up the building when
he ’5 still down there with his crew

16:14.141 --> 16:16.723

’Cause we’rejust wasting time here,

16:16.810 --> 16:19.643

16:19.729 --> 16:22.061
Violence in the workplace
correlates to domestic violence.

without that anger
spilling over at home.

been proud of these men.

to tiy to bring industry to our city.

blown up the building?

When you and your wife
were separated,

24:18.541 --> 24:21.749

told her over the phone
brought her running back to you.

27:44.914 --> 27:48.406

27:48.501 --> 27:50.583
That’s Nadia telling
the truth.

27:50.670 --> 27:54.458
She’s talking with her hands.
It’s what we call illustrators.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.006

ifshe knew who you were

27:57.093 --> 27:59.175

licking the lips,

28:46.559 --> 28:49.392
- I thought he was
coming back in tomorrow.
- He said he couldn’t wait.

- The truth.
She’s after his money.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.350
- That’s not the whole truth.
- It’s all he wanted to know.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.936

we found out.

would never intentionally
do harm to the building.

We’ve ruled out the
possibility of explosives.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.418
- Should be able to reach
the men within the hour.
- What was the exact cause?

29:20.509 --> 29:24.843

caused the building
to collapse.

He said so.

how this collapse happened.
