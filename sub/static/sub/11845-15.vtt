They're looking at me differently.

It's understandable that they're curious to see
how you'll react to this new information.

01:36.396 --> 01:41.232
Yeah, but I don't think they trust me.
I think they think that I'm a threat.

You think they're worried that
you'll tell the truth about them?

Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

Look, if they found out
that I was talking to you-

Let me assure you
that you can talk freely.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.460
I just wanted a normal life.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.058
Your anxiety's completely normal.

And then, let me be clear.
Isabel's a good person.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.634
I love her. You know, it's just them.

02:24.711 --> 02:28.978
It's just she's suffered protecting
their secret. And it's just- It's not-

Most people would have trouble condoning that.

After him. We've gotta find out
what he's talking about in there.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.124
If he's in therapy, he's obviously upset.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.630
Getting in his face is a bad idea.
I'll figure it out.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.223
I'm not gonna let you sit back
and wait for something to happen.

Max, it's not that I don't want to, it's just

Believe me, there's nothing good that
can come out of this conspiracy.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.253
Maybe, but I realize that I'm part of
something bigger than myself.

19:52.323 --> 19:55.884
It's not bigger. It's all-consuming.
There's a difference.

- Actually, they gave me one.

- It's not cheerleading.

were saying about Michael.

He's working against us.

- Let him go.
- Get out of here, Isabel. He's crazy.

33:17.894 --> 33:20.226
- Hey. Shut up!
- Back off, Michael.

33:20.296 --> 33:22.856
No, he has to die.

Somebody please tell me
it's gonna be okay.

33:43.286 --> 33:46.950
Listen,jesse, you were right.
We have to get away from here.

33:47.023 --> 33:49.720
From all of this. So let’s just go.

No.

34:21.123 --> 34:23.820
Okay, then.

You're gonna be very sorry you did that.

Nothing personal. I just wanted to
make sure you were a man of your word.

- Now give me the tape.
- That Michael Guerin has a big mouth, doesn't he?

36:32.054 --> 36:34.921
He was always one of our prime suspects,
but we could never pin anything on him.

36:34.990 --> 36:37.425
I am serious. I will shut you down.

36:37.493 --> 36:40.861
I don't think so. With this information...

- They don't tickle.

37:22.738 --> 37:26.333
Thanks for healing them.

That was the best
I could do with that.

- No.
