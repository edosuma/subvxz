00:04.504 --> 00:06.199
Hello?

00:11.845 --> 00:13.870
Hello?

00:16.248 --> 00:17.511
l'm here.

00:17.584 --> 00:19.279
Hello?

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.713 --> 00:49.477
l'm here to see Mr. Kurros.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.846
Could you...?

00:54.154 --> 00:57.351
Could you tell me where
to find Mr. Kurros? Ooh...

00:58.591 --> 00:59.558
Wait.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.704
Do not mind Bevvox.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.773
He can be... grouchy
in the morning.

01:24.851 --> 01:26.284
Welcome aboard.

01:26.352 --> 01:27.614
Thank you.

01:27.687 --> 01:28.949
You seem tense.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.080
No.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.387
This is a time for celebration.

01:33.460 --> 01:37.226
The geo-stability of your world
has been restored...

01:37.297 --> 01:38.787
your people saved...

01:38.865 --> 01:40.890
and all because you
had the wisdom

01:40.967 --> 01:42.798
to accept our help.

01:42.902 --> 01:44.392
You accomplished in days

01:44.504 --> 01:47.701
what our scientists failed
to achieve in decades.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.870
That it not to say
it was not a challenge.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.175
Finding the precise harmonic

01:54.247 --> 01:56.943
for a planetary
containment field

01:57.016 --> 01:59.007
did put my colleague here
to the test,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.280
but, in the end...

02:01.354 --> 02:03.117
she prevailed.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.487
We owe you our lives.

02:05.558 --> 02:08.220
Solving problems is what we do,

02:08.294 --> 02:11.491
and seeing the look
of gratitude in your eyes

02:11.564 --> 02:14.089
is almost reward enough.

02:14.167 --> 02:15.691
Almost.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.828
l have some bad news.

02:18.938 --> 02:22.499
Our bernicium mines
were destroyed

02:22.609 --> 02:25.077
in the last series of quakes.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.147
The ore's buried
under 60 gigatons of rock.

02:28.214 --> 02:29.511
We can't get to it.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.948
We hoped you'd accept
this instead.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.916
A rubidium geode.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.579
Priceless.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.317
The only one ever found
on our planet.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.086
lt is rare...

02:41.261 --> 02:44.424
but hardly unique

02:44.497 --> 02:47.591
and it is not
what we agreed upon.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.599
l'm sorry.

02:48.701 --> 02:49.998
This is all we can offer you.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.270
You are lying.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.968
The mines collapsed,
but before they did,

02:57.043 --> 03:00.206
you transferred the ore
to a shielded storage facility.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.305
Needless to say...

03:02.382 --> 03:04.179
we detected it.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.478
Please, we need the ore

03:05.552 --> 03:07.383
to repair
our replicator systems.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.752
Without it, we'll be unable
to feed our people.

03:10.823 --> 03:14.122
Get it to us now...

03:14.194 --> 03:17.391
or l will deactivate
the containment field.

03:17.463 --> 03:20.899
Have you ever experienced
a level-12 seismic event?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.398
Most find it...

03:22.502 --> 03:24.231
...quite unnerving.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.827
No.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.304
l'll have the ore
transported at once.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.314
This... this was all
a misunderstanding.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.542
Of course.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.484
lt is already forgotten,
my friend.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.454
Perhaps we will do business
again someday.

03:43.523 --> 03:44.785
Yes.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.519
Show our friend back
to his shuttle.

03:47.594 --> 03:51.655
l would hate for him to get lost
in such an unfamiliar place.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.669
Oh!

04:04.811 --> 04:07.041
Pardon me.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.829
Yes.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.464
Captain, long-range scans
have detected...

06:15.575 --> 06:16.837
One second.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.206
l've wasted two hours

06:18.277 --> 06:20.768
on this thing
and l'm no closer to solving it.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.747
You can thank Ensign Paris
for introducing

06:22.815 --> 06:24.077
the artifact to the ship.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.482
He was behind
the last shipwide craze, too--

06:26.552 --> 06:27.883
''yo-yos.''

06:27.954 --> 06:28.978
Now it's ''sheer lunacy.''

06:29.055 --> 06:30.454
Another hour and l'll go insane.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.115
The solution is quite simple.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.453
lf you align...

06:33.526 --> 06:35.289
No. l want
to figure this out myself.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.066
You said something
about long-range scans?

06:42.168 --> 06:43.726
They've revealed a planetoid

06:43.836 --> 06:46.066
with high concentrations
of dilithium crystals.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.606
Let's take a look.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.316
Got it!

07:03.022 --> 07:04.421
False alarm.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.425
Keep at it, Harry.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.120
We're within visual range.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.423
On screen.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.428
lnitial scans revealed

07:13.499 --> 07:16.798
substantial dilithium deposits
beneath the planetoid's crust.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.495
Full sensor sweep.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.740
The deposits are
in the upper mantle,

07:21.841 --> 07:22.830
about 60 kilometers down.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.876
We'll have to use
phasers to cut through...

07:24.944 --> 07:25.876
Hold on.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.105
What is it?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.876
Some kind of resonance wave
emanating from the core.

07:29.949 --> 07:30.881
lt's building fast, Captain.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.110
Right after we ran our scans.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.379
That can't be a coincidence.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.420
Back us off, Tom.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.120
The planetoid is destabilizing.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.487
Shields.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.030
Report.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.760
We're trapped in a cloud
of metreon gas.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.096
lt's collapsed our warp field

07:50.203 --> 07:51.693
and knocked
impulse engines off-line.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.772
A heavily armed vessel
just dropped out of warp,

07:53.840 --> 07:54.898
off the port bow.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.373
Captain, l recognize it.

07:57.443 --> 07:58.910
lt's Hazari.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.637
Species 4228.

08:00.713 --> 08:03.181
Technologically advanced,
extremely violent.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.274
They make excellent
tactical drones.

08:05.351 --> 08:06.784
What do they want with us?

08:06.853 --> 08:10.812
The Hazari are hired to capture
and deliver alien vessels.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.016
Bounty hunters.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.025
Yes.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.025
So who hired them?

08:15.094 --> 08:16.391
The Malon,

08:16.462 --> 08:18.794
the Devore-- we've made
our share of enemies here.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.457
They're hailing.

08:23.736 --> 08:26.364
Surrender.
No one need be hurt.

08:26.472 --> 08:30.374
My client would prefer
your vessel intact.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.876
Who hired you?

08:31.978 --> 08:34.105
That's not your concern.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.808
l'm only asking because l'm
curious how much they're paying.

08:36.883 --> 08:37.871
Maybe we can do better.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.008
Doubtful.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.019
We're far from defenseless.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.577
Why don't you
save yourself some trouble.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.087
lt's no trouble.

08:44.155 --> 08:48.456
Charge phaser banks
to full power.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.359
Fire and you'll ignite
the gas cloud.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.453
You'll be destroyed.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.123
You've left me no choice.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.632
l suggest you back off

08:54.700 --> 08:56.361
if you want to save
your own ship.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.697
End transmission.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.771
They are moving closer.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.768
They've locked on
a tractor beam.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.140
Looks like they're
calling your bluff, Captain.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.508
lt was a bluff, wasn't it?

09:06.579 --> 09:10.515
Seven, do we still
have warp power?

09:10.583 --> 09:13.450
Yes, but it's useless while
we remain in the gas cloud.

09:13.519 --> 09:14.816
Maybe not.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.253
Reroute every spare gigawatt
to the shields.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.483
Prepare to fire phasers.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.650
Our target?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.022
The gas cloud.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.618
Do you believe the impact
will throw us clear?

09:23.696 --> 09:25.027
lf our shields hold.

09:25.097 --> 09:26.826
That's a big if.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.457
Go to warp 1 on my command.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.866
Fire.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.437
Shields are holding.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.415
We're approaching
the perimeter of the gas cloud.

09:45.618 --> 09:46.710
We're out.

09:46.786 --> 09:47.912
Warp speed.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.023
No sign of pursuit.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.351
They weren't
that heavily damaged.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.694
Why aren't they following us?

10:06.005 --> 10:07.529
There's the reason
they didn't come after us.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.632
They've got reinforcements
throughout the sector.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.370
23 ships.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.345
And long-range scans
show more on the way.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.812
Must be one hell of a reward.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.746
The size of the bounty
is immaterial.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.650
According to Seven of Nine,
the Hazari pride themselves

10:20.720 --> 10:22.153
on honoring their agreements.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.246
Great. Bounty hunters
with a work ethic.

10:24.323 --> 10:26.188
There's got to be a way out,

10:26.258 --> 10:28.055
something
they haven't anticipated.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.924
Download the data
for the Captain.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.931
She wants to see what she
can come up with on her own.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.907
Should l have the Doctor
prepare a hypospray?

10:49.982 --> 10:51.006
Excuse me?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.983
So you can absorb
the caffeine more directly.

10:54.053 --> 10:55.213
Save time.

10:55.287 --> 10:56.447
Point well taken.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.456
l'll make this my last cup.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.856
How about trying
a sounding board?

11:00.926 --> 11:02.860
Oh, you don't want that job.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.192
Try me.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.822
lt's these Hazari.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.560
They're like jackals.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.364
Circling...
feinting to draw us out

11:11.470 --> 11:14.735
while they cut off
every route of escape.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.741
You make them sound
worse than the Borg.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.538
At least the Borg
come straight at you.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.772
The Hazari wait,
invite you to make mistakes.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.144
They've anticipated
almost every move we can make,

11:23.215 --> 11:25.183
and the few things
they seem to have missed,

11:25.251 --> 11:26.343
l'm convinced are traps.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.545
You still glad you volunteered?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.315
We've faced tough odds before.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.481
You'll get us through.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.790
Good night.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.224
Night.

11:50.743 --> 11:53.211
There is nothing
like a good problem

11:53.279 --> 11:55.509
to spark the synapses, is there?

11:55.581 --> 11:57.549
To open the mind

11:57.616 --> 12:01.450
to new possibilities...
new ways of seeing things.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.114
Of course, one must
always confront

12:04.190 --> 12:08.149
self-doubt and fear,
but that is a small price to pay

12:08.227 --> 12:13.722
for the... exhilaration
of finding the perfect solution.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.825
Who are you
and what do you want?

12:16.936 --> 12:20.394
You have a problem, Captain.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.804
l am the solution.

12:30.216 --> 12:33.447
Security to the Mess Hall.
lntruder alert.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.215
l deactivated
your communications device,

12:36.288 --> 12:38.483
Captain, but do not worry.

12:38.557 --> 12:40.320
l am not an intruder.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.952
ln fact, l am not really here.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.529
A hologram.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.292
Nothing so crude.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.959
An isomorphic projection.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.003
You actually enjoy this?

12:56.142 --> 12:58.007
lt's an acquired taste.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.170
lt bears a resemblance
to an Alkian confection

13:01.247 --> 13:03.306
we acquired several years ago.

13:03.382 --> 13:04.872
''We''?

13:04.950 --> 13:08.716
l am a member of a small group--

13:08.788 --> 13:12.884
explorers like you,
but we seek out challenges,

13:12.958 --> 13:14.892
problems to be solved--

13:14.960 --> 13:18.521
technological, biological,
social,

13:18.597 --> 13:19.791
even artistic.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.264
A think tank.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.597
l like that.

13:23.702 --> 13:26.671
lt's very... apt.

13:26.772 --> 13:30.264
Our ''Think Tank'' is nearby.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.105
A modest vessel.

13:32.178 --> 13:37.081
l have come to offer our help
with your Hazari paradox.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.117
''Paradox''?

13:39.185 --> 13:41.653
That is right.

13:41.720 --> 13:49.126
ls it an escape route
or is it a trap?

13:49.195 --> 13:52.961
Do they know that you know
that they know?

13:53.098 --> 13:55.658
lt is the best kind of puzzle--

13:55.734 --> 13:59.101
pure tactics, psychology.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.163
Something tells me your help
comes with a price tag.

14:02.274 --> 14:06.711
Whatever your culture has
to offer that is unique.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.974
Technology perhaps,
or maybe something

14:09.048 --> 14:11.073
you would not
even think to value.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.277
l would need a closer look
at your database.

14:13.352 --> 14:17.152
And how do l know you
aren't an Hazari trap?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.850
Maybe they're trying

14:18.924 --> 14:22.087
to lure us
into an ambush like before.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.619
You are wise
to be suspicious, Captain.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.792
We have done
some preliminary analysis

14:28.901 --> 14:30.425
on their maneuvers.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.438
lt does suggest
some more likely ambushes.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.304
l've downloaded the data
onto your computer.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.417
All right.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.349
You've got my attention,

14:47.419 --> 14:50.183
but l want to meet
you face-to-face

14:50.256 --> 14:51.951
and the rest of your crew.

14:52.057 --> 14:56.084
Naturally. Our coordinates
are in here, too,

14:56.161 --> 14:59.255
but we have our own security
concerns, Captain.

14:59.331 --> 15:02.994
Please bring only one crewman
and no scanning equipment.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.831
Fair enough.

15:05.004 --> 15:08.735
Then, l look forward
to meeting you... in person.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.046
We're approaching
the coordinates.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.089
Full stop.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.851
Looks like there's nothing here.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.222
Maybe they're cloaked.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.784
l'm reading a subspace flux.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.857
The vessel's hull is composed
of a neutronium-based alloy.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.903
Starfleet's theorized
about such materials,

15:38.971 --> 15:41.701
but we've never come close
to producing them.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.833
Neither have the Borg.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.503
The Think Tank's technology
is advanced.

15:46.578 --> 15:49.342
Well, you and l will have a
chance to evaluate it firsthand.

15:49.415 --> 15:53.784
Mr. Kim, you have
the transport coordinates.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.656
The universal translator
must be inoperative.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.703
Or his speech patterns
are too complex to process.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.412
They must be studying it.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.880
Actually, she is studying you.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.885
Our resident expert
on temporal physics.

16:27.953 --> 16:30.421
Perhaps the most gifted
member of our group.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.822
She finds you interesting.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.223
How do you communicate?

16:35.294 --> 16:40.027
One of my most gifted crewmen,
Seven of Nine.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.896
Bionetic implants...

16:42.034 --> 16:44.161
neural transceivers?

16:44.269 --> 16:46.396
A Borg?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.939
l've never seen one
outside the collective.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.372
l am an individual now.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.569
You may address
your comments to me.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.942
Forgive me.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.608
l am Kurros and this is Fennim.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.184
ln answer
to your earlier question,

17:06.258 --> 17:09.318
this device allows
the members of our group

17:09.395 --> 17:11.454
to communicate telepathically.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.928
lmpressive.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.869
lt sounds as if
another member of our crew

17:19.972 --> 17:22.566
is anxious to meet you.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.984
A bioplasmic life-form.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.319
His name is Bevvox.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.258
He prefers
a variable-gravity environment.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.625
What's his specialty?

17:44.696 --> 17:47.893
At the moment, exo-sociology
and quantum mechanics,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.662
but his interests vary
from time to time.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.896
Bevvox founded our group
more than 100 years ago,

17:53.072 --> 17:56.508
after wandering the galaxy on
his own for a few millennia.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.167
How old is this creature?

18:02.214 --> 18:07.151
lf you please, that is
a sensitive topic with him.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.687
And there is one
other... individual

18:12.758 --> 18:15.318
who rounds out our group.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.331
An artificial intelligence.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.833
The mind of a mathematician

18:22.968 --> 18:25.368
and the soul of an artist.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.497
l'm afraid he'd much rather
be modeling a fractal sculpture,

18:28.607 --> 18:31.576
than analyzing the data
of our latest astronomical scan.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.872
And now you have met us all.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.709
A small group of minds,

18:35.781 --> 18:38.875
but we have helped
hundreds of clients.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.418
We turned the tide in the war

18:40.486 --> 18:42.579
between the Bara Plenum
and the Motali Empire,

18:42.654 --> 18:45.623
reignited the Red Giants
of the Zai Cluster.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.888
Just recently, we found
a cure for the Vidiian phage.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.986
The Vidiians?

18:51.063 --> 18:52.860
You would
hardly recognize them now.

18:52.931 --> 18:57.061
Just last month, we helped
retrieve a Lyridian child's

18:57.169 --> 19:00.070
runaway pet-- a subspace
mesomorph, l might add.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.970
We had to invent
a whole new scanning technology

19:02.040 --> 19:03.405
just to find it.

19:03.475 --> 19:07.070
And what did you ask
for as compensation?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.910
One of their transgalactic
star charts--

19:09.982 --> 19:13.315
the best map of
the known galaxy ever created.

19:13.385 --> 19:17.481
When we helped the citizens
of Rivos V resist the Borg,

19:17.556 --> 19:20.081
all we asked for was
the recipe for their famous

19:20.159 --> 19:22.093
zoth-nut soup.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.152
Care for a taste?

19:24.229 --> 19:26.823
Another time, perhaps.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.769
Tell me,
is there any job you won't do?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.272
What do you mean?

19:35.340 --> 19:39.504
Well, we have a non-interference
protocol-- our Prime Directive.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.637
l'm curious
where you draw the line.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.173
As you know, there is
no shortage of conflict

19:46.251 --> 19:48.879
in what you call
the Delta Quadrant.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.581
Many of our clients are at war.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.616
To be frank, we will assist

19:55.694 --> 19:58.629
in the neutralization
of fleets, starbases,

19:58.697 --> 20:01.257
even planets, but we will
not participate

20:01.333 --> 20:03.893
in the decimation
of an entire species,

20:04.002 --> 20:07.062
nor will we design weapons
of mass destruction.

20:09.408 --> 20:10.670
Hmm.

20:10.742 --> 20:14.143
My colleague here wishes
to speak to Seven of Nine

20:14.213 --> 20:16.306
about her bionetic technology.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.212
May he interface with you?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.829
l am in direct
telepathic communication

20:32.898 --> 20:34.456
with this... individual.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.559
lt is requesting
information about

20:37.669 --> 20:40.365
integrating organic components
into its technology.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.838
Feel free to give him
some pointers.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.314
You're welcome.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.280
To business, Captain.

20:55.354 --> 20:58.016
l believe we can solve
the Hazari paradox

20:58.156 --> 21:00.124
without firing a single weapon.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.921
That's just
what l'm looking for.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.087
Then there is only
the matter of payment.

21:08.867 --> 21:12.803
Voyager's schematics
and an overview of its database.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.738
Specify what you want
and l'll see what l can do.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.536
l recommend the replicators.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.577
They're very popular this year.

21:19.678 --> 21:21.873
l'll contact you
with our requests.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.091
l take it first contact
was a success?

21:34.159 --> 21:36.423
l have some qualms
about their morality,

21:36.495 --> 21:38.326
but l believe they can help us.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.228
lt was an interesting
experience.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.425
Glad to hear it.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.559
We don't have much
good news of our own.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.638
Every escape route we've
considered is clearly a trap

21:46.738 --> 21:49.468
and more Hazari ships
keep joining the search.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.168
Then we have no choice.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.404
We'll put our own plans on hold

21:53.478 --> 21:56.538
and see what the Think
Tank comes up with.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.226
Come in.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.732
You have a visitor.

22:15.801 --> 22:19.168
Mr. Kurros has returned
in isomorphic form.

22:19.237 --> 22:20.898
Send him in.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.370
Welcome back.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.539
Captain, we have
compiled a short list

22:29.614 --> 22:31.548
of items we would like.

22:31.616 --> 22:32.947
lt was not easy.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.578
Voyager has
a great deal to offer.

22:35.654 --> 22:38.885
''Quantum slipstream technology.''

22:38.957 --> 22:39.889
l should warn you.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.585
We never got that
to work reliably.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.958
lt is still intriguing,
theoretically.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.964
''Neelix's recipe
for chadre'kab?''

22:47.099 --> 22:49.124
Yes.

22:49.234 --> 22:53.364
''An ancient Olmec figurine.''

22:53.472 --> 22:55.133
l guess Commander Chakotay

22:55.240 --> 22:57.265
could be persuaded
to part with it.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.570
l'm pleased to hear that.

23:03.415 --> 23:05.440
You can't be serious.

23:05.517 --> 23:09.385
l realize the next item
may seem unorthodox,

23:09.454 --> 23:10.614
but l believe

23:10.689 --> 23:12.623
it can be beneficial
to both of us.

23:12.691 --> 23:16.320
You never mentioned anything
about bartering my crew members.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.523
She will have an
extraordinary opportunity

23:19.598 --> 23:22.192
to explore the galaxy
as one of us.

23:22.267 --> 23:24.599
l'm afraid the answer is no.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.766
l understand
your feelings, Captain, but...

23:28.874 --> 23:34.176
have you thought to ask
Seven of Nine herself?

23:42.587 --> 23:44.384
A curious proposition.

23:44.456 --> 23:45.923
To say the least.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.493
How do you wish to proceed?

23:49.561 --> 23:51.654
l want your opinion.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.164
They are offering us
the assistance we require.

23:54.232 --> 23:55.961
l am the payment they require.

23:56.134 --> 23:57.362
The solution is obvious.

23:57.469 --> 23:58.936
This isn't a puzzle, Seven.

23:59.037 --> 24:00.436
There's no ''solution.''

24:00.539 --> 24:03.440
What's at issue here
is your future.

24:03.475 --> 24:06.171
The issue is Voyager's survival.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.075
Sit.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.339
Please.

24:14.719 --> 24:16.152
While l still question

24:16.221 --> 24:18.746
this Think Tank's
way of doing things,

24:18.824 --> 24:22.885
there is a genuine
opportunity for exploration.

24:23.028 --> 24:25.792
lt could be the chance
of a lifetime.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.627
You're saying l should go?

24:27.699 --> 24:30.133
l don't want you to go,

24:30.235 --> 24:33.534
but it's not my right
to tell you what to do.

24:33.605 --> 24:36.631
Until now, l've kept
a close eye on your progress,

24:36.741 --> 24:38.072
helped you with decisions,

24:38.143 --> 24:40.941
but l think you've learned
enough as an individual

24:41.046 --> 24:43.344
to make this decision yourself.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.383
Would you like to join them?

24:47.085 --> 24:48.643
l am intrigued.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.349
They are an unusual collective
with a compelling mission,

24:52.424 --> 24:53.948
but l require more data.

24:54.025 --> 24:57.153
That's why l want you
to talk to Kurros yourself.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.527
See if he can answer
your questions.

24:59.598 --> 25:01.725
Captain...

25:01.833 --> 25:04.529
l appreciate
your giving me this choice.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.537
You've earned it.

25:06.605 --> 25:11.338
And remember--
if you do choose to go...

25:11.409 --> 25:13.969
make sure it's what you want...

25:14.045 --> 25:17.014
not what you think
is best for Voyager.

25:17.082 --> 25:19.073
We're getting out of this--

25:19.150 --> 25:22.586
with or without
the Think Tank's help.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.022
Why me?

25:28.093 --> 25:30.186
l admire your humility.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.594
The collective knowledge
of the Borg

25:32.664 --> 25:34.689
contained within a single mind.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.564
When we factor in
your innate intelligence

25:37.669 --> 25:39.762
and the enhancements
afforded you

25:39.871 --> 25:41.498
by your bionetic implants,

25:41.606 --> 25:44.370
we concluded you are
an ideal candidate...

25:44.442 --> 25:47.070
the first we have
recruited in 17 years.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.739
When did you arrive
at this assessment?

25:49.814 --> 25:53.147
During your... interview.

25:54.452 --> 25:56.886
My dialogue with
the artificial intelligence.

25:56.955 --> 26:00.254
lt was the most efficient way
to evaluate your abilities.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.816
l am sure
you can appreciate that.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.826
How much do you know about me?

26:04.963 --> 26:06.396
Enough to know

26:06.464 --> 26:08.728
that you are tapping
into only a fraction

26:08.800 --> 26:12.827
of your potential
as a member of Voyager's crew.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.463
You were adjusting
the deflector array

26:15.574 --> 26:17.838
to improve shield harmonics.

26:19.744 --> 26:23.077
Do you find such duties
challenging?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.374
No.

26:25.450 --> 26:27.145
Without problems that test

26:27.218 --> 26:31.314
the limits of your abilities,
you cannot expand them.

26:31.389 --> 26:34.517
Perfection will always be
beyond your reach.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.857
Seven of Nine, you could become

26:36.928 --> 26:40.386
one of the greatest intellects
in the galaxy,

26:40.465 --> 26:43.730
but that will not happen here
among these

26:43.835 --> 26:45.894
limited life-forms.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.369
The crew of Voyager
has accepted me...

26:48.440 --> 26:49.737
integrated me
into their collective.

26:49.808 --> 26:52.072
integrated me
into their collective.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.509
They are your family.

26:55.981 --> 27:00.008
lt was hard for me
to leave my family, too...

27:00.085 --> 27:03.680
and l was only a child...

27:03.755 --> 27:08.283
not much older than you
when you were first assimilated.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.827
Why did you leave?

27:09.894 --> 27:14.797
To help them-- and my world--
solve a cataclysmic problem.

27:14.866 --> 27:18.461
The Think Tank
requested you as payment?

27:18.570 --> 27:21.562
l did not realize it
at first-- l was too young--

27:21.673 --> 27:25.074
but they gave me
a remarkable opportunity,

27:25.143 --> 27:28.772
and now l am offering
the same to you.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.509
Your group can assist
many collectives,

27:31.583 --> 27:33.881
and yet you often
use that ability

27:34.019 --> 27:37.250
as a means of coercion
to obtain what you want.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.756
How many have suffered
because they were

27:39.824 --> 27:42.156
unwilling to agree
to your conditions?

27:42.227 --> 27:46.664
We have a singular mission--
to perfect our knowledge.

27:46.731 --> 27:52.260
Perfection sometimes
necessitates selfishness.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.531
lt is your life...

27:54.639 --> 27:59.338
not Voyager's, not Captain
Janeway's or anyone else's.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.639
lt is up to you

28:00.745 --> 28:04.203
to achieve the goals
you have set for yourself.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.717
l agree.

28:10.088 --> 28:12.648
But l can do that here.

28:14.959 --> 28:19.055
Please, take more time
to think about this.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.793
We will remain nearby
in case you change your mind.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.732
l doubt that will happen.

28:24.836 --> 28:28.294
Seven of Nine,
report to the Bridge.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.101
Acknowledged.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.403
May l accompany you?

28:31.476 --> 28:32.909
As you wish.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.175
Do you have a problem, Captain?

28:41.252 --> 28:43.777
Two Hazari ships
are approaching.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.584
l have declined their offer.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.583
Our first offer.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.651
Glad you're sticking around.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.060
Take your station.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.223
They are dropping out of warp,

28:54.299 --> 28:56.233
flanking our position.

28:56.334 --> 28:58.529
Which one fired?

28:58.636 --> 28:59.967
The ship to starboard.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.699
Shields down to 60 percent.

29:02.774 --> 29:04.241
Evasive maneuvers.

29:04.342 --> 29:07.243
Target their weapon systems
and return fire.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.274
Their shields are holding.

29:10.348 --> 29:12.543
l can't get away.
They're right on top of us.

29:13.785 --> 29:17.050
Hull integrity's been
compromised on Decks 7 and 12.

29:17.122 --> 29:20.319
Captain, when the Hazari
strike in pairs,

29:20.391 --> 29:22.518
one ship always remains behind

29:22.594 --> 29:25.791
to reinforce the shields
of the attacking vessel.

29:25.864 --> 29:28.264
So we should target
the support ship.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.801
How much is this tip
going to cost me?

29:30.902 --> 29:32.699
This one is free.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.172
l'll take it. Tuvok...

29:36.241 --> 29:38.402
Retargeting.

29:38.476 --> 29:40.501
Firing photon torpedoes.

29:43.314 --> 29:44.872
They are disengaging.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.883
Get us out of here--
maximum warp.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.179
Thanks for the help.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.653
Consider it a friendly gesture
of good will

29:50.722 --> 29:53.213
in the hopes that Seven
will change her mind.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.485
l have not.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.618
You are making a fatal mistake.

29:56.694 --> 29:59.857
We have already analyzed
hundreds of scenarios.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.900
Voyager will not survive
without our help.

30:03.001 --> 30:04.764
Your scenarios, not mine.

30:04.869 --> 30:07.235
Your confidence
is unfounded, Captain.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.296
Reconsider.

30:09.407 --> 30:12.001
Order Seven of Nine to join us.

30:13.378 --> 30:15.403
We have an old expression,
Kurros--

30:15.480 --> 30:17.277
''Don't call us. We'll call you.''

30:17.348 --> 30:20.511
Remodulate the shields
to a phase-variant frequency.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.920
His ship is vanishing
from sensors.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.428
lt's being absorbed
into subspace.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.794
l get the distinct feeling

30:33.865 --> 30:35.423
they won't take no
for an answer.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.933
Same here.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.265
Looks like we're facing
two threats now--

30:39.370 --> 30:44.034
the Hazari...
and our would-be saviors.

30:49.881 --> 30:51.906
Our offer was denied.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.473
How shall we proceed?

30:53.551 --> 30:56.213
We are already proceeding.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.414
Our offer was refused.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.185
We must let
the scenario continue.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.419
Our calculations indicate

31:03.461 --> 31:07.830
a 96 percent chance
the Borg will still be ours.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.363
Then it is decided.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.768
We will wait...

31:14.839 --> 31:18.240
and let our problem...
solve itself.

31:27.352 --> 31:29.513
Duranium hull fragments,

31:29.587 --> 31:32.215
a thruster assembly,
human organic residue...

31:32.290 --> 31:36.522
We were supposed
to disable their ship,

31:36.594 --> 31:38.323
not destroy it!

31:38.396 --> 31:40.261
They've entered
the debris field.

31:40.331 --> 31:44.131
Detonate the spatial charges.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.670
Their vessel has taken
heavy damage.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.735
Shields and weapons
are off-line.

31:54.812 --> 31:56.245
Move us into position.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.713
Lock on a tractor beam

31:57.782 --> 32:00.012
and pull them
into the shuttlebay.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.144
We're in transporter range.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.881
l've got a lock.

32:03.988 --> 32:04.886
Two life-forms.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.422
Energize.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.873
Any luck?

32:28.947 --> 32:32.246
l'm still trying to access
their primary database.

32:32.317 --> 32:33.784
Let me guess.

32:33.851 --> 32:35.409
They're the strong
but silent types.

32:35.486 --> 32:36.646
Very silent.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.279
Did you try a mind-meld?

32:38.356 --> 32:39.414
Without success.

32:39.490 --> 32:40.684
They're unusually resistant.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.692
Well, hold off on the torture

32:42.760 --> 32:44.694
till we see
what we can dig up here.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.725
l found something.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.461
A series of encoded
transmissions.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.934
They've been
discussing Voyager--

32:53.004 --> 32:54.301
our coordinates, our defenses.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.205
Whoever hired the Hazari
know a lot about us.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.299
Check their sensor logs.

32:58.409 --> 32:59.671
See if they had
any visitors recently.

32:59.744 --> 33:03.236
l've got some bio-readings,
but they're pretty scrambled.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.406
lf they are bio-readings,

33:04.449 --> 33:06.144
perhaps the Doctor
can unscramble them.

33:06.217 --> 33:07.377
Tell him to give it a try.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.657
l've created
a forensic reconstruction

33:14.726 --> 33:17.160
from the bio-readings,
using the holo-emitters.

33:17.228 --> 33:19.093
Brace yourselves.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.794
Malon.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.869
Huh... they must
really hold a grudge.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.870
We haven't run into them
for months.

33:27.939 --> 33:28.906
l'm sorry, Doctor.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.564
Something doesn't feel right.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.439
The Malon are
economically motivated.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.911
And there's no profit
in revenge.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.538
Take a look at this.

33:37.615 --> 33:41.312
lsomorphic signatures
embedded in the bio-readings.

33:41.386 --> 33:42.910
This was no Malon.

33:42.987 --> 33:44.852
lt was only a projection.

33:44.922 --> 33:46.890
You mean that's a hologram...

33:46.958 --> 33:48.425
of a hologram?

33:48.493 --> 33:49.926
ln a manner of speaking.

33:49.994 --> 33:51.518
l believe l can restore

33:51.596 --> 33:53.757
the original
bio-signal parameters.

33:53.831 --> 33:55.958
Brace yourself.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.098
Well, it appears

34:02.206 --> 34:06.666
our Hazari paradox is
more complex than we thought.

34:06.778 --> 34:11.612
l believe we're both being
manipulated by the same person.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.011
Recognize him?

34:17.487 --> 34:18.750
No.

34:18.822 --> 34:20.882
His name is Kurros.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.255
The Malon you met with

34:23.327 --> 34:25.318
was nothing more
than a projection.

34:25.396 --> 34:28.456
My sensors would have
detected a hologram.

34:28.533 --> 34:29.625
Not this one.

34:29.699 --> 34:33.636
Kurros is a member
of a... Think Tank.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.002
They solve problems for a price.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.735
Oh, you have heard of them.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.109
They're notorious
in this sector.

34:42.179 --> 34:44.148
They've made
quite a few enemies.

34:44.215 --> 34:47.309
Enemies who might be willing
to pay a hell of a bounty.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.409
Their technology
is very advanced.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.512
Makes them difficult to track.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.920
Not if we work together.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.389
You're the best hunters
in the Quadrant

34:55.460 --> 34:57.189
and we have the perfect lure.

34:57.261 --> 35:00.230
All we have to do now is...

35:00.298 --> 35:04.234
outthink the Think Tank.

35:04.335 --> 35:06.030
We've got a puzzle,

35:06.137 --> 35:08.537
and we're not leaving this room
until we solve it.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.198
The Think Tank
is out there somewhere,

35:10.308 --> 35:12.173
hiding in subspace.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.642
How do we find them?

35:13.711 --> 35:15.872
And even if we can,
their ship's hull

35:15.947 --> 35:19.246
is neutronium-based alloy,
impervious to our weapons.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.683
How do we capture them?

35:21.752 --> 35:24.277
What if we send out
a multispatial probe?

35:24.355 --> 35:26.380
lt would take weeks
of scanning to find them.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.481
Weeks?

35:27.558 --> 35:29.549
We're not willing
to wait that long.

35:29.627 --> 35:33.324
We could use subspatial charges
to force them into the open.

35:33.397 --> 35:35.024
Where do we target the charges?

35:35.099 --> 35:36.225
We've still got
to find them first.

35:36.334 --> 35:39.303
Maybe we're going about this
the wrong way.

35:39.370 --> 35:42.168
A direct assault
seems unlikely to succeed.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.232
''Pure tactics, psychology...''

35:45.343 --> 35:48.335
that's how they solve problems.

35:48.412 --> 35:50.073
That's what we have to do.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.740
They've created this paradox

35:51.816 --> 35:54.944
to manipulate us
into giving them Seven of Nine.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.917
How do we manipulate them?

35:58.356 --> 35:59.983
Think.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.705
l thought we were onto something
with B'Elanna's plan to...

36:19.777 --> 36:21.039
Forget it.
l was wrong.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.044
Let him talk.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.512
We're talking in circles.

36:23.581 --> 36:24.878
Enough!

36:25.016 --> 36:27.849
Three hours, no progress.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.410
l should have contacted
my ships by now.

36:30.488 --> 36:32.353
Maybe we can't outthink them.

36:32.423 --> 36:33.890
Captain?

36:34.025 --> 36:36.425
We have to assume they've
planned for every contingency,

36:36.494 --> 36:39.395
including anything we could come
up with to undermine their plan.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.090
This thing
has been driving me crazy.

36:41.165 --> 36:43.963
You said you knew
the solution. Prove it.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.013
Seven, how'd you do that?

37:04.088 --> 37:05.487
l scanned the device.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.525
lts mechanism operates
on a simple fractal regression.

37:08.593 --> 37:09.821
You scanned it?

37:09.927 --> 37:11.258
That's cheating.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.388
Cheating is often
more efficient.

37:13.464 --> 37:16.558
lf you can't solve a puzzle,
cheat.

37:16.667 --> 37:21.036
lf you can't outthink
a Think Tank, don't try.

37:21.105 --> 37:23.039
Are you suggesting we give up?

37:23.107 --> 37:24.369
Not at all.

37:24.442 --> 37:25.875
When you were in contact

37:25.943 --> 37:27.570
with the artificial
intelligence,

37:27.645 --> 37:28.771
you were linked

37:28.846 --> 37:30.871
through their internal
communications array.

37:31.015 --> 37:32.243
Yes, for several seconds.

37:32.316 --> 37:34.546
lf you were to link
with them again,

37:34.619 --> 37:37.349
we might be able
to disrupt those systems.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.888
lf they can't communicate,

37:38.990 --> 37:41.356
they can't function
as a Think Tank.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.722
They'd be vulnerable.

37:42.793 --> 37:45.284
Back to square one--
how do we find them?

37:45.363 --> 37:47.729
Simple.
We give them what they want.

37:47.798 --> 37:52.531
You're going to join
their group willingly.

37:52.637 --> 37:53.899
They won't believe her.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.597
We'll have
to make them believe.

37:55.706 --> 37:56.900
Pull up a chair.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.303
We've got some more work to do.

38:08.352 --> 38:12.618
An Hazari vessel is sending
hails into subspace.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.385
lt's trying to contact us.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.016
Put them through.

38:16.093 --> 38:18.288
They're responding.

38:18.362 --> 38:21.354
Hazari vessel,
we have received your hails.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.093
Can we be of assistance?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.667
You deceived us.

38:24.735 --> 38:27.067
l do not believe we have met.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.571
Stop the pretense.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.130
You wanted us
to deliver Voyager.

38:31.242 --> 38:35.042
Very well, but only
if you triple our bounty.

38:35.112 --> 38:38.707
My friend,
regardless of the circumstances,

38:38.783 --> 38:40.478
we have a contract.

38:40.551 --> 38:44.043
Pay us, or we let Voyager go.

38:46.924 --> 38:48.118
All right.

38:48.192 --> 38:50.319
We will triple the bounty,

38:50.394 --> 38:53.659
but you must deliver them
to us... now.

38:53.731 --> 38:54.857
Agreed.

38:54.932 --> 38:57.093
We'll contact
the rest of our ships.

38:57.201 --> 39:00.534
We'll seize Voyager as planned.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.945
Shields down to 30 percent.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.279
Return fire.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.583
Our phasers aren't penetrating
their shields.

39:17.655 --> 39:18.679
That last volley took out

39:18.756 --> 39:20.417
our shield generators
and phaser banks.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.289
Life support's failing,
all decks.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.522
Let us be honest, Captain.

39:25.596 --> 39:28.292
Things do not seem
to be going your way.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.129
Don't count us out just yet.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.031
l admit you have been clever.

39:32.136 --> 39:34.001
You uncovered our subterfuge,

39:34.071 --> 39:37.097
but you failed to factor in
all the variables.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.676
The greed of the Hazari,
for example.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.308
Photon torpedoes?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.076
Aft launchers are still on line.

39:45.149 --> 39:47.640
Target a full spread
at the lead Hazari ship.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.243
A few torpedoes will
not alter the outcome.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.812
lf you do not convince
Seven of Nine to join us now,

39:52.890 --> 39:55.882
the destruction of your ship
is 99.8 percent certain.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.551
Fire.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.325
Direct hit.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.388
lt's been disabled.

40:02.466 --> 40:05.435
Clinging to that .2 percentage?

40:05.503 --> 40:08.563
Hazari reinforcements
should be here any minute.

40:08.672 --> 40:10.037
He's right.

40:10.107 --> 40:11.472
Sensors just picked up

40:11.542 --> 40:13.442
a half dozen ships
on an intercept course.

40:13.511 --> 40:17.572
Captain, l'm detecting
an unauthorized shuttle launch.

40:17.648 --> 40:19.115
lt's Seven of Nine.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.217
What the hell is she doing?

40:24.288 --> 40:27.849
l believe
she's saving your ship.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.120
She's not answering hails.

40:30.194 --> 40:32.822
Her shuttle's being
pulled into subspace.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.330
She's gone.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.457
Have a safe journey home...

40:37.535 --> 40:39.127
Captain.

40:45.843 --> 40:48.710
Seven of Nine, welcome.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.747
Your hospitality is irrelevant.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.306
l am here because
you left me no choice.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.682
You gave in
to your human instincts

40:55.753 --> 40:58.449
to save your crew,
as we knew you would.

40:58.522 --> 41:00.956
Just another factor
in our equation.

41:01.058 --> 41:04.084
lf Voyager is destroyed,
l will not cooperate.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.390
Do not worry.

41:05.463 --> 41:09.559
The solution to the Hazari
paradox is quite simple.

41:11.702 --> 41:13.135
We have what we want.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.637
Call off your attack.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.935
Not until we've
been compensated.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.508
Fine.

41:18.609 --> 41:21.703
But first order your
other vessels to stand down.

41:21.779 --> 41:24.839
Now, or we'll destroy Voyager.

41:28.886 --> 41:30.786
Why is he in such a hurry?

41:30.855 --> 41:32.880
Comply.

41:32.957 --> 41:37.485
lf we de-cloak,
we would be vulnerable.

41:37.561 --> 41:41.429
The Hazari could make
quite a bounty on us...

41:41.499 --> 41:43.899
far more
than we are paying them.

41:44.001 --> 41:46.299
Their technology
is inferior to yours.

41:46.403 --> 41:48.701
They would never
attack you directly.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.501
l think this is a trap--

41:50.574 --> 41:53.975
a new paradox your Captain
has created for us.

41:54.044 --> 41:56.205
lf we call their bluff,

41:56.280 --> 42:01.081
the Hazari might destroy Voyager
and we would lose you.

42:01.151 --> 42:05.349
lf we reveal ourselves,
we could be destroyed.

42:05.422 --> 42:07.083
You told me, ''without problems

42:07.157 --> 42:09.182
''to test the limits
of your ability,

42:09.260 --> 42:12.127
you can never expand them.''

42:12.196 --> 42:16.690
There is one very simple way
to narrow the odds.

42:16.767 --> 42:21.830
We simply link you
to our communications system,

42:21.939 --> 42:24.373
allow our artificial
intelligence

42:24.441 --> 42:27.103
to probe your mind
as it did before,

42:27.177 --> 42:29.839
and Captain Janeway's plans

42:29.914 --> 42:34.078
will be revealed like a jewel
in a bed of fog.

42:42.526 --> 42:43.823
Sick Bay to Bridge.

42:43.894 --> 42:46.954
Seven's neural transceiver
has been activated.

42:47.097 --> 42:49.361
Acknowledged.
Do it.

42:49.433 --> 42:53.369
l'm transmitting
the carrier wave.

43:05.449 --> 43:07.974
Voyager is sending
an interference signal

43:08.052 --> 43:11.579
into our systems using her
cortical implants as a relay.

43:11.655 --> 43:12.917
Disconnect the link.

43:14.358 --> 43:17.885
Disconnect the link.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.053
They can't understand you.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.891
Voyager to Hazari vessels.

43:25.069 --> 43:26.866
Their systems are down.

43:26.971 --> 43:28.939
Fire the spatial charges.

43:31.408 --> 43:34.741
We seem to be experiencing
some turbulence.

43:34.812 --> 43:36.404
Primitive spatial charges.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.471
l will have the dome
back on line

43:38.549 --> 43:40.483
before they can do any damage.

43:45.022 --> 43:46.489
We're being pulled
out of subspace.

43:53.063 --> 43:54.587
l've got a lock on Seven.

43:54.665 --> 43:56.360
lnitiate transport.

43:57.935 --> 43:59.869
The Hazari vessels

43:59.937 --> 44:01.905
are converging
on the Think Tank.

44:02.006 --> 44:02.802
Tom.

44:02.873 --> 44:04.841
Setting a course.

44:04.908 --> 44:08.139
l urge you
to reconsider, Captain.

44:08.212 --> 44:10.407
A good guest knows when he's
outstayed his welcome.

44:10.481 --> 44:14.008
We can still negotiate
a peaceful solution.

44:14.084 --> 44:17.110
Do not destroy
my faith in diplomacy.

44:17.187 --> 44:19.519
Your diplomacy could use
some polishing.

44:21.458 --> 44:22.891
You know you will never be

44:22.993 --> 44:26.656
satisfied here,
among these people.

44:26.730 --> 44:29.290
ls this what you really want?

44:29.366 --> 44:32.597
Acquiring knowledge
is a worthy objective,

44:32.703 --> 44:36.036
but its pursuit
has obviously not elevated you.

44:38.208 --> 44:41.336
Looks like
your ship's having difficulties.

44:44.648 --> 44:46.081
A minor problem.

44:46.150 --> 44:48.380
Oh, l'm sure
you'll find a solution.

44:48.452 --> 44:51.148
Just give it some... thought.
