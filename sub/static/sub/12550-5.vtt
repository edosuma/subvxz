WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.520
She's not in there.

00:03.520 --> 00:07.000
Sure? You want to come and look?

00:07.000 --> 00:10.120
Didn't think so. She's not in there.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.960
Course I'm not.
Dolly, are you all right?

00:17.359 --> 00:19.720
She's fine, Jenny.

00:19.720 --> 00:24.960
Tracy got her out. Thank you, Tracy.
And thanks, Adele. Stay for lunch.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.000
Oh, no! Lunch!
It'll be charcoal by now.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.920
Jenny, Adele needs a little word.
OK.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.559
The thing is...
the bedsit's OK, but...

00:37.559 --> 00:43.720
I know this sounds crazy, but I'm
missing you all. You're my family.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.759
Well, I was wondering,
if it was not too late,

00:47.759 --> 00:50.400
maybe I could have my old room back.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.120
If that's what you want, you could.

00:53.120 --> 00:58.719
You don't think I'd be wimping out?
You think this is a soft option?

00:58.719 --> 01:02.960
If Adele's moving back,
I suppose I will as well.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.400
Two independent girls together.
But no fussing, no hassling,

01:07.400 --> 01:11.439
and no cheer-up jokes.
We don't need it. No way.

01:11.439 --> 01:15.360
You're ready to come back?
No choice.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.679
You lot can't manage without me.

WEAPON FIZZLES

06:19.399 --> 06:22.759
Mistress, I bring you another.

06:22.759 --> 06:26.560
Bring me more.
I need more. So many more children.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.119
It shall be done, Mistress.

06:46.120 --> 06:50.960
At breakfast times I am so hungry I
could murder a bowl of cornflakes.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.999
Does that make me a CEREAL killer?

06:54.600 --> 06:57.760
You're not laughing.
It wasn't very funny.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.040
But I've been studying jokes,
their structure and history.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.039
You swap words around.
So that was a joke.

07:04.039 --> 07:06.720
Well, I don't think it'll get you
on the telly.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.840
So what makes a joke funny? I've
read timing is important. But how?

07:10.840 --> 07:14.719
I don't know, it's complicated.
Is the context important?

07:14.719 --> 07:16.759
Why does everything with you lead

07:16.759 --> 07:19.720
to about 500 questions?
Come on, I want a new bag.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.120
You've got lots of bags.
You can never have too many bags.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.200
Another thing I don't understand.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.520
You're a guy, you're not meant to.

07:29.239 --> 07:31.599
What do you reckon, soldier?

07:31.599 --> 07:35.120
Do you think you're
man enough to have a go?

07:35.120 --> 07:40.719
I have to go shopping. Well, that's
kind of answered my question.

07:40.719 --> 07:43.759
Come on, Luke. Here you go.

07:43.759 --> 07:47.440
Cut-price vouchers in case
you change your mind. Thank you.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.120
Thanks. Come on.

07:57.919 --> 08:01.159
Posters are up. I'm doing
a local radio piece at three,

08:01.159 --> 08:04.800
and I've given the half-price tickets
to a street team to shift.

08:04.800 --> 08:09.079
You wait, Mr Kudlak. The last
few weeks' takings will be nothing

08:09.079 --> 08:11.560
compared to what we've got coming.

08:11.560 --> 08:16.279
Oh, we've got a birthday party
shoot 'em up booked in for tomorrow.

08:16.279 --> 08:18.040
HISSING ROAR

08:18.040 --> 08:22.560
I grow tired of your talk,
Mr Grantham. Just bring me children!

08:30.999 --> 08:33.320
This is Lance.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.360
Oh, thank you, Mrs Metcalf.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.200
I can't begin to imagine what
the last three days have been like.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.720
How you're coping.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.440
I keep thinking my head's
going to break.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.040
That's what it feels like.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.880
I'm on edge every minute,

08:52.880 --> 08:55.480
thinking that he'll
walk up the path,

08:55.480 --> 08:57.880
or the police will come
and tell me...

08:57.880 --> 09:01.200
Children do turn up safely.
There's still every chance.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.040
Someone may have seen something
without knowing it.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.240
My story might make them
come forward.

09:06.240 --> 09:10.399
I hope so. Has anything like this
happened before?

09:10.399 --> 09:15.000
Lance has never run away after
an argument? We never argue.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.999
Me and Lance,

09:16.999 --> 09:19.800
we've only got each other now.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.760
We know that life's too short
for rowing.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.759
I see.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.240
I'm sorry.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.479
Well, perhaps you could tell me
what happened on Saturday.

09:32.479 --> 09:35.600
Nothing happened, only
Lance never came back.

09:35.600 --> 09:39.000
He was going out to
meet his friend, Brandon.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.400
They were going down the arcade.
He lives for his video games.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.040
Only Brandon never
saw him on Saturday.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.960
Lance never showed up.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.960
He just vanished into thin air.

09:55.999 --> 09:59.160
Help me get my boy back, Miss Smith.
Please.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.760
LAUGHTER

10:13.600 --> 10:17.399
Do you mind?
Ah, sorry, Sarah Jane.

10:17.399 --> 10:21.840
Clyde was just bogging around
with Maria's new bag. I'm sorry?

10:21.840 --> 10:25.960
Mucking. I was MUCKING around.
Or messing.

10:25.960 --> 10:30.999
The words are important in slang,
Luke. You can't improvise.

10:30.999 --> 10:34.199
Sorry, we'll get out of your way.
No, no, wait.

10:34.199 --> 10:37.159
I saw the mother
of that boy that went missing.

10:37.159 --> 10:39.400
Your friend, Lance Metcalf.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.440
Friend? Don't get me wrong,
Sarah Jane, I hope he's OK.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.280
But the Corporal's not really been
up for making friends.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.560
The Corporal? Lance. Lance Corporal.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.959
And did you know his father was in
the Army and was killed in Iraq?

10:56.959 --> 10:58.759
Nicknames aren't always funny.

10:58.759 --> 11:02.159
Well, I hope he didn't
run away because he was bullied.

11:02.159 --> 11:07.119
Luke made up the nickname. People
laughed. I thought that was good.

11:07.119 --> 11:10.160
It wasn't Luke's fault.
No-one knew about Lance's dad.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.640
He didn't tell anyone. He didn't
have much to do with any of us.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.919
At break he was too busy
with his Nintendo.

11:16.919 --> 11:19.799
But I made a joke out of his name.

11:19.799 --> 11:22.800
Maybe Lance wanted friends,
like I did.

11:22.800 --> 11:27.279
Instead, I probably made him
run away! Oh, no, Luke it was...

11:27.279 --> 11:29.599
It's all my fault! No, Luke, look...

11:29.599 --> 11:31.920
I'd better go and talk to him.

11:31.920 --> 11:36.439
No. Let me. I did drop him in it.
OK.

11:38.119 --> 11:41.360
Is he finding it really hard,
Maria, to fit in?

11:41.360 --> 11:45.400
No harder than the rest of us.
Clyde will talk to him. He'll be OK.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.440
How was Lance's mum? Oh,
going out of her mind with worry.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.999
Do you think there's something
weird about Lance disappearing?

11:54.999 --> 11:59.159
I mean, you don't think there's
aliens involved, or anything?

11:59.159 --> 12:02.200
I don't see aliens
behind every bush, Maria.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.040
I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.439
No, I know.
I just wondered, that's all.

12:06.439 --> 12:10.120
Now, this friend of Lance Metcalf's,
Brandon. Do you know him?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.560
ELECTRONIC WEAPONS FIRE

12:29.640 --> 12:31.159
Hi, Brandon.

12:32.599 --> 12:34.920
What do you want?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.200
This is my friend, Sarah Jane. Hi.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.720
I want to ask you some
questions about Lance.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.160
That's him.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.800
Halo? Yeah, that's Lance.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.359
He's the nuts. Is that good?

12:49.359 --> 12:51.639
Very. Oh.

12:51.639 --> 12:55.440
I was meant to meet him
on Saturday in the park.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.439
We was going to go to the arcade.
And did you? Well, he never showed.

12:59.439 --> 13:01.120
The storm may have put him off.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.840
There wasn't a storm.
Are you calling me a liar?

13:03.840 --> 13:08.160
No. But Saturday was warm and sunny.
I was in the garden until dark.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.680
Yeah. Well, it was weird, wasn't it?
It only lasted a minute.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.479
All these clouds came up the hill
and then it just poured on me.

13:15.479 --> 13:18.960
Then the clouds just vanished
and it was blue skies again.

13:18.960 --> 13:24.840
I mean, it was weird, and...
Frightening? Yeah.

13:34.280 --> 13:38.080
Man, I thought you'd gone AWOL,
along with Lance.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.400
Been looking all over for you. Why?

13:40.400 --> 13:42.240
Cos that's what friends do.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.840
They try and help. And friends
shouldn't grass each other up.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.640
I'm sorry.
How did you "grass me up"?

13:48.640 --> 13:52.439
Look, we'll get back to Slang 101
another day. Ding-ding. New class.

13:52.439 --> 13:56.040
How the Corporal doing a runner
has got nothing to do with Luke.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.880
Don't call him that. He's not here.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.120
I wasn't trying to be cruel.
I was trying to be funny.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.239
Yeah. Well, not everyone's cut out
to be me. ..See what I mean?

14:17.320 --> 14:18.559
Kudlak?

14:18.559 --> 14:20.359
I am here, Mistress.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.479
Time grows short.
You must bring me children, Kudlak.

14:23.479 --> 14:26.079
Fresh, strong, children.

14:26.079 --> 14:28.999
I will, Mistress. You have my vow.

14:28.999 --> 14:32.119
This hunger for blood, it never ends.

14:32.119 --> 14:34.440
You shall have what
you need, Mistress.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.560
Soon you shall have
all the children you need.

14:43.519 --> 14:46.720
Have all these kids really
gone missing in a year?

14:46.720 --> 14:50.999
Mr Smith, we need to cross-reference
these disappearances with reports

14:50.999 --> 14:53.119
of localised freak weather
conditions.

14:53.119 --> 14:56.080
'I will assimilate with
meteorological databases.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.399
'Processing initiated.'

14:58.399 --> 15:02.320
I don't get it. What has this storm
got to do with Lance going missing?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.200
That's what we'll find out.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.759
I don't think Brandon's the sort to
be scared by a normal storm, do you?

15:08.759 --> 15:13.079
Maybe there is something "weird"
about Lance's disappearance.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.320
'I have a data-match for
twenty-four children.'

15:16.320 --> 15:18.600
Twenty-four?

15:18.600 --> 15:22.799
'Their disappearances all coincide
with instances of unexpected

15:22.799 --> 15:26.960
'but short-lived torrential rain.'
All towns and cities.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.280
Why would it rain like that?
'Insufficient data.'

15:30.280 --> 15:34.120
Well, Mr Smith,
maybe we can get you some more.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.720
So what are we doing, exactly?
Pass me that spanner.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.720
What do you know about energy?
It can't be created or destroyed.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.560
Very good.

15:46.560 --> 15:52.080
Now, a storm is created by,
and in turn creates, energy.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.479
The residue in the atmosphere
could tell us quite a lot.

15:56.479 --> 16:00.360
Now put those rubber gloves on and
pass me those two metal cylinders,

16:00.360 --> 16:01.879
one at a time.

16:01.879 --> 16:05.160
No! I said put the gloves on first!

16:05.160 --> 16:07.320
Those are made from Cibrianite flux.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.359
Touch them both at the same time
without protection

16:10.359 --> 16:14.200
and you complete a circuit that
will put you out cold for an hour.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.959
Oh. You know,
we should get my dad over.

16:17.959 --> 16:21.360
He's good at DIY. We could
say it's my science project.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.639
He's got lots of tools.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.360
Bet he hasn't got one of these.
Stand back.

16:29.719 --> 16:33.520
Sometimes it feels like
I'll never fit in to this world.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.760
When I made a joke about
Lance's name, it felt like...

16:36.760 --> 16:39.160
like a breakthrough
because people laughed.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.840
Instead, it was another
social miscalculation.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.639
Gaffe, Luke. It was a gaffe.

16:43.639 --> 16:46.719
You said a "gaff" was where
a "dude" lives. It's different.

16:46.719 --> 16:51.040
Just stick to the text, OK? You see?
Things are so complex.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.960
Complex?! Be grateful your old man
didn't run off with your Aunt Melba.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.640
Just listen to me.
I'm an expert in complex.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.240
So you can explain things?

16:59.240 --> 17:02.880
Just ask Encyclopaedia Clydannica.
Go on, anything you want.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.638
What's the purpose of games?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.079
Why play games?

17:08.079 --> 17:09.520
This.

17:10.759 --> 17:13.878
This looks like war.
But it's a game. Why?

17:15.920 --> 17:19.319
It's just a laugh. But they
pretend to kill people.

17:19.319 --> 17:22.440
OK. You want to find out?
Let's do it.

17:28.959 --> 17:30.880
Mistress is worried.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.960
It has been a month,
yet our returns are minimal.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.720
I can't help the kids being
low-grade. We must find better.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.520
We must work harder.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.799
Your Mistress should go out
with a sandwich board.

17:42.799 --> 17:44.680
She could hand out some flyers.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.959
Do not mock my Mistress.
It was a joke. OK?

17:47.959 --> 17:51.360
We serve at her pleasure,
Mr Grantham. Yeah, sure, sure.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.239
Neither of us is irreplaceable.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.999
Not I, and certainly not you.

17:55.999 --> 17:59.439
HISSING ROAR

18:03.240 --> 18:07.920
Ta-da! Right, this is where
Brandon got caught in the rain.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.919
Come on, let's get her going.

18:09.919 --> 18:11.439
OK.

18:13.839 --> 18:15.759
Right, now,

18:15.759 --> 18:18.720
turn the dial...on the left

18:18.720 --> 18:22.080
6.02 for the electromagnetic
pulse trace.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.240
Just got to calibrate
the Kohonen net.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.720
Right switch to 15
and the middle to 2.6.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.119
Now, then...

18:32.119 --> 18:33.839
Right. Fire her up.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.680
BLEEPING
Again. Oh.

18:50.239 --> 18:51.960
Nothing. Once more.

18:56.079 --> 18:58.679
There should be
some sort of reaction.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.520
What's happening? It works!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.999
My machine works!

19:11.839 --> 19:15.720
'Particles identified
as entanglement shells.'

19:15.720 --> 19:20.079
OK. And do you want to tell us what
an entanglement shell is, exactly?

19:20.079 --> 19:23.400
'Used by climate engineers
to terraform hostile environments.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.599
'In order to support life,
they stimulate rainfall.'

19:26.599 --> 19:29.479
Ealing doesn't need that.
We get too much rain.

19:29.479 --> 19:31.360
'If I might continue?'

19:31.360 --> 19:33.879
Please. 'Entanglement shells
can also be

19:33.879 --> 19:36.880
'a by-product of trans-dimensional
energy dispersal.'

19:36.880 --> 19:38.799
By what?

19:38.799 --> 19:40.600
Teleportation.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.960
Aliens! I knew it!

19:42.960 --> 19:45.039
Lance was kidnapped by aliens?

19:45.039 --> 19:48.199
Oh, they've been kidnapping people
from Earth for decades.

19:48.199 --> 19:51.160
The question is, why Lance?
And from where?

19:51.160 --> 19:54.960
Mr Smith, can you pinpoint the exact
centre of the storm on Saturday?

19:54.960 --> 19:58.999
'Weather geo-stationary satellites
record every hour and are unlikely

19:58.999 --> 20:02.080
'to have registered such a brief
meteorological anomaly.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.680
'I will access a military satellite.'

20:04.680 --> 20:07.840
You shoot out people's sensors.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.719
If you get hit, your gun goes down

20:09.719 --> 20:12.799
for five seconds and
you lose a life. You get 100 lives.

20:12.799 --> 20:15.840
The person at the end
with the most lives left wins.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.600
Last man standing.
But I still don't get the point.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.239
Wait until the adrenaline
starts pumping!

20:21.239 --> 20:23.880
'Attention, Warriors of the Future!

20:23.880 --> 20:26.200
'Take your places at the Arena Doors.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.840
'Prepare to do battle. Show no mercy,

20:28.840 --> 20:30.439
'take no prisoners.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.439
'This is a fight for survival.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.719
'Only one can be
the ultimate warrior.

20:35.719 --> 20:38.319
'Battle commences in ten seconds...'

20:38.319 --> 20:41.959
Well, Grantham?
Have you brought me good stock?

20:41.959 --> 20:45.000
I wouldn't get your hopes up
just yet.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.680
'Four...three...two...one!'
Take no prisoners!

20:47.680 --> 20:51.439
'Commence combat!'

20:51.439 --> 20:52.960
THEY ALL SCREAM

20:55.039 --> 21:00.280
'This is animated data from a NATO
satellite covering Western Europe.

21:00.280 --> 21:04.840
'Taken on Saturday at 1604 hours.'
THUNDER RUMBLES

21:04.840 --> 21:06.920
Run it again. And slow it down.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.400
People never vanish without a trace.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.840
There's always a footprint,
a tyre track.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.840
You've just got to know
where to look. Stop.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.800
Show me what's right there,
at the heart of it.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.799
I know that place...
We were there earlier, me and Luke!

21:32.919 --> 21:35.520
Combat 3000!

21:59.040 --> 22:00.480
Cover me, cover me!

22:01.480 --> 22:03.799
Watch out!

22:08.439 --> 22:10.959
Go, Luke, I'll cover you.

22:13.239 --> 22:20.080
Well, well, well. You're not such
a mummy's boy after all, are you?

22:20.080 --> 22:25.199
Mmm. Someone shows promise?
There's a couple of kids.

22:25.199 --> 22:27.479
One of them is really something.

22:27.479 --> 22:33.000
Really going for it, it's like
he's got something to prove.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.480
I smell warrior blood!

22:36.480 --> 22:41.359
Mistress will be pleased. Aaaahh!

22:41.359 --> 22:43.999
I wouldn't bet your spaceship
on it just yet.

22:43.999 --> 22:47.520
Let's see
if he makes it through Level Two.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.760
Hey, I won!

23:05.760 --> 23:08.439
And look! You came second!

23:08.439 --> 23:11.919
Yeah. Beginners' luck,
I guess. Maybe we should go again.

23:11.919 --> 23:13.680
I thought you said it was for kids.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.640
It's all part of your education.
I'm not enjoying it or anything.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.879
Impressive score, Soldier Eight.

23:19.879 --> 23:23.040
He says it was beginners' luck.
But I've got better reflexes

23:23.040 --> 23:26.599
and hand to eye co-ordination
than most kids. You do? Wow.

23:26.599 --> 23:29.399
Well, you make one hell of a
Future Warrior, Soldier.

23:29.399 --> 23:34.199
You mean I'd be good at killing
people? ..If the eventuality arose.

23:34.199 --> 23:37.279
You don't get invited to
too many parties, do you?

23:37.279 --> 23:39.400
I was showing him what to do.
He's Luke.

23:39.400 --> 23:44.559
Which makes me Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Soldier Seven. How's it going?

23:44.559 --> 23:48.360
OK, listen up. Me and Mr Kudlak,
he's the proprietor,

23:48.360 --> 23:51.880
we run a special competition
for the more skilled competitors.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.960
It's Level Two. Now, what do
you think? Are you up for it?

23:54.960 --> 23:57.559
Yeah! Good.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.960
Welcome to the unique gaming
experience that IS Combat 3000.

24:05.960 --> 24:09.200
Zap those Drones.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.000
Hi. Erm, yep,
I'd like to book a party.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.440
I've heard a lot about this place.
Apparently it's The Nuts.

24:17.959 --> 24:20.800
OK, let's agree to never say that
ever again.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.800
I wouldn't if I were you. I'm sorry?

24:22.800 --> 24:26.199
For her, is it?
I'd take her to see a film.

24:26.199 --> 24:28.639
You don't want to come here,
it's mental.

24:28.639 --> 24:32.559
Used to be lovely and peaceful,
till Mr Grantham took over.

24:32.559 --> 24:36.119
Mr Grantham? Him and his partner,
Mr Kudlak.

24:36.119 --> 24:39.640
Not that anybody ever sees him. Would
it be possible to speak to him?

24:39.640 --> 24:43.799
D'you know, it always seems to be
raining since they moved in.

24:43.799 --> 24:48.480
My sister's offered me part-time in
The Tanning Salon and I'm thinking,

24:48.480 --> 24:51.400
"Well, you only live once."

24:51.400 --> 24:55.320
Tell you what, why don't we
just go through. You're busy. Hey!

24:58.240 --> 25:01.399
Welcome to the unique
gaming experience...

25:01.399 --> 25:03.720
See him? He does kick boxing,

25:03.720 --> 25:07.360
she does athletics for the county,
and he's in the football A team.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.679
This is wicked. It's like
Premier League for laser tag.

25:10.679 --> 25:14.719
OK, guys. Well done for getting
through to Level Two.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.559
New arena, new objective.

25:20.559 --> 25:23.440
You'll be split into
four dispersement groups.

25:23.440 --> 25:27.840
You'll access the arena
from here, here and here.

25:27.840 --> 25:31.240
When the first siren sounds,
you'll break for cover.

25:31.240 --> 25:37.240
When the second siren sounds,
the mission begins. Mission?

25:37.240 --> 25:42.559
The first soldier to make it through
the door, down the corridor

25:42.559 --> 25:48.559
and into this chamber will win their
place in the World Championships.

25:48.559 --> 25:51.159
They have a laser tag
World Championships?!

25:51.159 --> 25:53.599
That's kinda why I said it.
Now, this time,

25:53.599 --> 25:56.400
you don't get 100 lives, OK?

25:56.400 --> 25:58.920
You get ten. Ten?

25:58.920 --> 26:01.960
Piece of cake. Do you think so?

26:01.960 --> 26:03.479
A word of advice, son,

26:03.479 --> 26:05.559
the ultimate Warrior of the Future

26:05.559 --> 26:08.959
is always on guard
for surprise attacks.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.119
Seems like a good place to start.

26:20.119 --> 26:22.240
SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRRS

26:34.999 --> 26:36.199
Whoa!

26:36.199 --> 26:40.439
The others are playing by the old
rules. To be the last man standing.

26:40.439 --> 26:44.160
If we work as a team,
we'll have the strategic advantage.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.839
Like I said. Piece of cake.

26:55.519 --> 26:56.920
ALARM SOUNDS

26:56.920 --> 26:59.319
Aaaargggh!

26:59.319 --> 27:01.440
Grantham... Grantham!

27:01.440 --> 27:03.079
What are we looking for?

27:03.079 --> 27:05.719
You'll know when you find it.
See what bubbles up.

27:05.719 --> 27:07.960
Does that mean you don't know?

27:07.960 --> 27:10.720
Not as such. Perhaps I can help?

27:13.520 --> 27:15.959
Mr Grantham, I presume.
Not Mr Kudlak.

27:15.959 --> 27:17.719
He likes to stay in the shadows.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.480
I wonder why that is? Who are you
and what are you doing in my office?

27:21.480 --> 27:23.599
Sarah Jane Smith. Journalist.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.160
Who's she? My work experience girl.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.800
It was either this
or putting up scaffolding.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.720
I'm doing a story on laser games

27:34.720 --> 27:38.280
and their effect on aggression
levels among young people.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.880
No comment. Now get out.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.000
Any comment on Lance Metcalf?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.520
The boy that disappeared
three days ago.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.759
24 children have disappeared.
Manchester, Brighton, Leeds...

27:51.759 --> 27:54.439
All cities where
there's a Combat 3000.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.560
Every time in the middle
of a freak storm.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.840
Still no comment, Mr Grantham?

27:58.840 --> 28:04.320
Do you know why people come to
Combat 3000, Miss Smith, hmm?

28:04.320 --> 28:06.559
They come for the guns.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.880
A soldier that fights alone
dies alone.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.280
These two will do, Mistress.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.200
'Good, Kudlak. Send them to me.

28:23.200 --> 28:28.239
'Send them to me!' In the name of the
Emperor, it shall be done, Mistress.

28:30.760 --> 28:31.999
HE LAUGHS EVILLY

28:33.360 --> 28:36.599
OK. That's it.
The door to the World Championships.

28:36.599 --> 28:39.759
How many lives do you have left?
Six. You?

28:39.759 --> 28:42.400
Four. I think we're well ahead
of the opposition.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.879
Are you ready?

28:43.879 --> 28:45.600
Remember what the manager said.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.760
Be ready for a surprise attack.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.920
I am ready to rock!
I am ready to roll!

28:57.199 --> 28:59.159
Move!

29:01.199 --> 29:03.279
Oh, please, don't be offended.

29:03.279 --> 29:05.760
This isn't the first time
I've seen a gun,

29:05.760 --> 29:10.320
and guns from other planets? Oooh,
afraid I've rather lost count.

29:10.320 --> 29:13.759
Will you die happy if I tell you
that I'm impressed?

29:13.759 --> 29:15.679
I'll die happy when I get Lance

29:15.679 --> 29:19.920
and the other children you kidnapped
to their parents safe and well.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.999
Don't worry about them, Miss Smith.

29:21.999 --> 29:24.599
Children adore war games.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.999
HE GROWLS AND LAUGHS

29:37.359 --> 29:40.639
Yeah! Aaahhhh!

29:46.199 --> 29:49.200
It's raining. They're powering up
the teleporter.

29:49.200 --> 29:53.519
Get rid of them, Grantham! Now!
FEEDBACK WHINES

29:53.519 --> 29:57.919
Don't you have any conscience about
what you're doing with those kids?

29:57.919 --> 30:00.360
Let me tell you about conscience.

30:00.360 --> 30:04.360
A conscience is like
a stone in your shoe.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.680
You cannot begin to imagine
the relief once you get rid of it.

30:10.279 --> 30:13.720
Goodbye, Miss Smith.
Just a moment. Please.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.999
Just a moment.

30:14.999 --> 30:17.439
Bit of lippy?

30:17.439 --> 30:18.640
Last request?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.679
LOUD FEEDBACK

30:23.679 --> 30:26.719
Come on! We don't have much time!
We have to find

30:26.719 --> 30:29.160
that transporter and shut it down!

30:29.160 --> 30:30.880
What happens now?

30:30.880 --> 30:33.520
Do we get like a trophy
or something? I don't know.

30:33.520 --> 30:37.320
But I'm thinking
this is kind of...weird.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.639
Come on, it's just a game.

30:43.879 --> 30:48.760
What exactly does a matter
transporter look like? Look!

30:48.760 --> 30:51.840
It's Luke and Clyde!

30:54.520 --> 30:55.560
What's going on?

30:59.520 --> 31:01.279
No! Be proud of them.

31:01.279 --> 31:04.800
MARIA SCREAMS
Where have you sent them? Where?!

31:04.800 --> 31:07.720
Into darkness!

31:07.720 --> 31:09.239
HE ROARS

31:15.919 --> 31:19.920
Oh-ho! Looks like things are
finally picking up round here.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.680
You're a disgrace
to your own species, Grantham.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.080
Kids from all over
must have gone missing.

31:25.080 --> 31:28.560
I doubt that men like you fare too
well in prison. What's with this

31:28.560 --> 31:31.279
Warrior stuff? All we did was
win a game of laser tag.

31:31.279 --> 31:32.880
Oh, yeah, we rock.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.560
It's not Kudlak that calls
all the shots.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.480
Whatever's going on
has got nothing to do with us.

31:38.480 --> 31:43.000
'Prepare them for transportation
to the front.' Yes, mistress.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.160
Kudlak doesn't see it like that.
I'll be back, Mr Grantham,

31:46.160 --> 31:47.719
I'll be back.
