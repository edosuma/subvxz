04:46.286 --> 04:48.411
Chingachgook.
How are you?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.304
The Master of Life is good, John.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.987
Another year passed.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.155
How is it with you?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.474
Getting along.
Yes, I am.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.761
Nathaniel.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.125
Hello, John.
Cleared another quarter, I see.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.225
Yes, I did.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.755
Alexandra.
Welcome.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.006
Jack, how are you?

05:15.106 --> 05:16.258
Hallo, Nathaniel.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.760
How've you been?
Good. Thank you.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.637
Where you boys
been trapping?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739
West of the Cuyahoga.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.615
Why is Uncas
with you?

05:25.826 --> 05:29.604
He should have settled with
a woman, started a family by now.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.083
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Uncas, look.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.696
Mohawk field we saw was five
mile long on the river.

05:37.796 --> 05:38.822
Chief Joseph
Brandt's field.

05:38.922 --> 05:39.865
You take much fur?

05:39.965 --> 05:40.991
That we did.
Lots.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.701
The Horicon's near trapped-out now.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.161
Where are you trading your skins?
Castleton?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.245
No.
Schuylerville.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.330
Schuylerville,
with the Dutch, for silver.

05:47.430 --> 05:51.935
French and English want to
pay with wampum and brandy.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.590
So what is it, Jack?
What brings you here?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.342
French and Indian army are heading
south out of Fort Carillon...

05:59.442 --> 06:00.969
...to war against the British.

06:01.069 --> 06:06.509
I'm helping to raise New York's
militia to fill the Crown's levy.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.896
And the people here
are gonna join in that fight?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.815
We'll see in the morning.
Where're you boys heading?

06:13.915 --> 06:17.694
We'll trap over the fall.
Winter in Can-tuck-ee.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.654
Find a Delaware-speaking woman for Uncas.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.366
She will say, 'You are the one. '
Bear him many children.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.702
Then you can have a boy like me.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.271
Never.
You are too strong.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.831
Turn me old too fast.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.906
That's what he's doing to his mama.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.482
John Cameron, thank
you for your hospitality.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.941
Mohawk traded furs with les français.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.735
We got no quarrel with les français.

06:58.835 --> 07:04.190
Now les français bring Huron,
Ottawa, Abenaki onto Mohawk land.

07:04.257 --> 07:08.082
Now Mohawk will fight
les français and Huron.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.331
I speak for the Twin Rivers
Mohawk of the Six Nations.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.252
His Majesty, King George II, is
very grateful for your support.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.628
How far up the valley?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.004
Up to Fort William Henry.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.881
That's two nights and a bit from here.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.259
Should be enough to remind you all
that France is our enemy.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.359
France is your enemy.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.263
What did you say?

07:26.363 --> 07:29.099
While we're at your fort, what
if the French attack our homes?

07:29.199 --> 07:30.392
What then, Lieutenant?

07:30.492 --> 07:33.722
For your homes, for King, for country.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.189
That's why you men
ought to join this fight.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.275
You do what you want
with your own scalp.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.694
Do not be telling us what
we ought to do with ours.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.948
You call yourself a patriot?
A loyal subject to the Crown?

07:45.048 --> 07:48.703
I do not call myself
subject to much at all.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.749
I agree with some of what
Nathaniel and John say,

07:54.849 --> 07:57.377
but I believe England's
still our sovereign.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.545
I'll go.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.629
We will go to fight the French.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.964
My brother and I will volunteer up.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.487
I'll fight with you, Jack.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.566
I'm staying on my farm.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.888
Any man who goes,
his family's welcome...

08:07.988 --> 08:09.723
...to fort up with us
till he comes back.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.600
Boys, my sense of it is...

08:11.700 --> 08:14.811
...we have enough here
to fill the county levy,

08:14.911 --> 08:17.063
and it's a fight we ought to make.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.942
But first we got to get
terms from General Webb.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.252
Where are you meeting him?

08:23.545 --> 08:25.545
We'll go to Albany.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.528
Attention.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.406
We speak for the men, not command them.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.075
If they're not allowed leave to
defend their farms and families...

09:52.175 --> 09:53.702
...if the French attack the settlements,

09:53.802 --> 09:56.329
than no colonial militia is
going to Fort William Henry.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.498
They will report or be
pressed into service.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.749
Any of the boys worth having...

09:59.849 --> 10:01.334
...can disappear into the forest.
They will be found.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.460
And where does that leave you then?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.129
Those men will be found, arrested...

10:04.229 --> 10:07.424
I cannot imagine His Majesty,
in his benevolence,

10:07.524 --> 10:11.594
would ever object to his
loyal American subjects...

10:11.694 --> 10:14.764
...defending their hearth and home,
their women and children.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.266
Does that mean they
will be granted leave...

10:16.366 --> 10:19.894
...to defend their homes if the
settlements are attacked?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.994
Of course.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.110
You got yourself
a colonial militia, General.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.210
It is what we wanted.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.493
Major Duncan Hayward reporting, sir,

10:35.593 --> 10:38.747
en route to Fort William Henry
and bearing dispatches.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.165
Safe journey, I trust?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.167
Yes, and I didn't
experience anything...

10:42.267 --> 10:44.127
...so surprising from
Bristol to Albany...

10:44.227 --> 10:46.087
...as that that I
witnessed here today.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.187
And what was that?

10:48.231 --> 10:51.801
The Crown negotiating
the terms of service.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.303
I know.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.264
One has to reason with these colonials
to get them to do anything.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.267
Tiring, isn't it?
But that's the lay of the land.

10:59.367 --> 11:04.212
I thought British policy is
'Make the world England,' sir.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.077
I see you're to serve with
the 35th Regiment of Foot...

11:17.177 --> 11:21.023
...at Fort William Henry
under Colonel Munro.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.124
I'll be marching
the 60th to Fort Edward.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.035
Explain to the Major,
he has little to fear...

11:33.109 --> 11:37.514
...from this General Marquis
de Montcalm in the first place,

11:37.614 --> 11:41.059
and therefore scent need of a
colonial militia in the second,

11:41.159 --> 11:44.854
because the French
haven't the nature for war.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.707
Their Latinate voluptuousness...

11:47.790 --> 11:51.319
...combines with their Gallic laziness.
And the result is,

11:51.419 --> 11:56.434
they'd rather eat and make love
with their faces than fight.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.535
Might I inquire if
General Webb has heard...

11:58.635 --> 11:59.869
...from Colonel Munro's daughters?

11:59.969 --> 12:04.040
I was to rendezvous with them in Albany
and escort them to the fort, sir.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.200
You there, what does Munro call you?

12:07.560 --> 12:12.090
The Scotsman has sent you one of
his Mohawk allies to guide you.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.190
Magua.

12:14.484 --> 12:18.638
The Scotsman's daughters
are at the Poltroon's house.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.850
A company of the 60th will accompany you,

12:21.950 --> 12:24.670
and Magua will show you the way.

12:25.703 --> 12:31.143
Dawn. At the encampment, 6:00 a. m.
sharp. See to it you're there.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.431
I'll take him for you, sir.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.352
Cora.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.854
Duncan.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.758
How long have you been in Albany?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.302
For days and days.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.428
And yourself?

12:58.528 --> 13:00.528
Just arrived.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.535
By God,
it's good to see you.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.683
I don't know what to say, Duncan.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.130
I truly wish they did,
but my feelings don't...

13:28.933 --> 13:31.228
Don't go beyond friendship.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.314
Don't you see?

13:38.067 --> 13:39.511
Respect and friendship.

13:39.611 --> 13:44.098
Isn't that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman to be married

13:44.198 --> 13:46.748
And all else may grow in time?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.394
Some say that's the way of it.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.687
Some?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.189
Cousin Eugenia, my father...

13:51.289 --> 13:53.066
Well, then, Cora.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.610
In my heart I know, once we're joined,

13:55.710 --> 13:59.072
we'll be the most marvelous
couple in London.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.172
I'm certain of that.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.577
So why not let those whom
you trust, your father,

14:04.677 --> 14:07.121
help settle what's best for you?

14:07.221 --> 14:10.750
In view of your indecision,
you should rely on their judgment.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.850
And mine.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.687
Will you consider that?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.779
Please consider that.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.242
Yes.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.189
Yes, I will.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.289
Duncan.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.003
By God, you've grown up.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.821
We leave in the morning?

14:39.921 --> 14:40.989
Yes, miss.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.532
I shan't sleep tonight.

14:42.632 --> 14:46.372
What an adventure.
Have you seen the red men?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.162
A few.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.165
I absolutely cannot wait to
return to Portman Square,

14:51.265 --> 14:52.917
having been to the wilderness.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.057
It's so exciting,
Duncan.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.640
Alice?

15:49.740 --> 15:50.767
Can we rest soon?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.867
Absolutely.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.037
You, there.

15:57.999 --> 16:02.300
Scout, we must stop soon.
Women are tired.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.407
Not here. Two leagues.
Better water. We stop there.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.076
No, stop in the glade just ahead.

16:08.176 --> 16:13.446
When the ladies are rested,
we will proceed. Do you understand?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.857
Excuse me.
What did you say?

16:22.482 --> 16:26.407
Magua said,
understand English very well.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.350
Hold tight.
Come on.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.605
Right. To the right.

18:31.193 --> 18:35.243
Prepare your firearms.
As three ranks.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.600
Make ready.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.700
Make ready.

18:42.038 --> 18:46.418
First and second rank, present.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.668
Fire.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.995
No, Duncan.

20:48.789 --> 20:53.039
In case your aim's
any better than your judgment.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.211
Your wounded should try
walking on back to Albany.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.286
They'll never make a passage north.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.592
Stop it. Stop it.
We need them to get out.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.261
Why's he loosing the horses?

21:18.361 --> 21:19.929
Why don't you ask him?

21:20.029 --> 21:23.854
Too easy to track.
They'll be heard for miles.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.594
We were headed to
Fort William Henry.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.645
We'll take you as far as the fort.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.644
We're walking out of here fast.

21:52.103 --> 21:58.138
Unless all of you'd rather wait for
the next Huron war party to come by.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.334
Scout, I'd like to
thank you for your help.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.919
How much further is it?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.587
Night and a bit.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.756
Appears we're well away from them.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.325
Maybe.
Maybe they ain't alone.

23:22.443 --> 23:23.719
That Huron captain back there...

23:23.819 --> 23:25.429
The guide?
He's a Mohawk.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.657
No Mohawk.
He's Huron.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.184
What reason did he have
to murder the girl?

23:30.284 --> 23:31.852
What?

23:31.952 --> 23:33.229
The dark-haired one.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.624
Miss Cora Munro?
Murder her?

23:36.373 --> 23:39.777
He never set eyes on her before today.
She's only been here a week.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.029
Blood vengeance?
A reproach or insult?

23:42.129 --> 23:44.129
Of course not.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.784
How is it you were so nearby?

23:46.884 --> 23:49.411
Came across the war party.
Tracked them.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.747
Then you're assigned
to Fort William Henry?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.374
No.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.474
Fort Edward then?

23:55.851 --> 23:58.231
Heading west to Can-tuck-ee.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.769
There is a war on.
How is it you are heading west?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.429
Well, we kind of face to the north,

24:06.529 --> 24:09.249
and real sudden-like, turn left.

24:09.657 --> 24:13.144
I thought all our colonial
scouts were in the militia.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.479
The militia is fighting
the French in the north.

24:15.579 --> 24:20.339
I ain't your scout.
And we sure ain't in no damn militia.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.633
Ottawa, two français.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.718
What did you say?

26:38.097 --> 26:39.957
Mirrors,

26:40.057 --> 26:43.527
tools, the clothes.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.311
Everything was inside.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.340
They didn't take anything.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.440
And moving fast.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.527
And a war party.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.696
Let us look after them.

26:58.909 --> 27:00.477
Leave them.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.688
Whoever they are,
though they're strangers,

27:02.788 --> 27:05.274
they're at least entitled
to a Christian burial.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.442
They can't be left behind.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.568
Let us go, miss.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.946
I will not. I've seen the
face of war before, sir,

27:11.046 --> 27:13.657
but I've not seen war made
upon women and children.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.157
And almost as cruel
is your indifference.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.564
Miss Munro,

27:31.024 --> 27:33.024
they're not strangers.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.323
And they stay as they lay.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.657
Why didn't you bury those people?

28:36.757 --> 28:42.707
Anyone looking for our trail would
see it as a sign we passed that way.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.015
You knew them well?

28:55.776 --> 28:59.856
You were acting for our
benefit, and I apologize.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.947
I misunderstood you.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.662
Well, that's to be expected.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.729
My father warned me about...

29:06.829 --> 29:08.829
Your father?

29:08.830 --> 29:11.692
Chingachgook.
He warned me about people like you.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.792
Oh, he did?

29:13.835 --> 29:17.320
He said, 'Do not try to understand them. '

29:18.632 --> 29:22.369
Yes. And, 'Do not try to
make them understand you.

29:22.469 --> 29:27.399
'That is because they are a
breed apart and make no sense. '

30:31.997 --> 30:33.565
Why did they turn back?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.665
Burial ground.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.602
'Breed apart.
We make no sense?'

30:47.471 --> 30:50.332
In your particular case,
miss, I'd make allowance.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.432
Thank you so much.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.359
Where is your real family?

31:03.195 --> 31:06.056
They buried my ma
and pa and my sisters.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.016
Chingachgook found me
with two French trappers,

31:08.116 --> 31:10.156
raised me up as his own.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.063
I'm sorry.

31:13.163 --> 31:16.733
I do not remember.
I wasn't but one or two.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.586
How did you learn English?

31:20.295 --> 31:26.245
My father sent Uncas and I to Reverend
Wheelock's school when I was 10.

31:29.888 --> 31:34.478
Why were those people living
in this defenseless place?

31:38.105 --> 31:39.464
After seven years
indentured service...

31:39.564 --> 31:40.882
...in Virginia, they headed out here...

31:40.982 --> 31:45.012
'cause the frontier's the only
land available to poor people.

31:45.112 --> 31:48.087
Out here, they're beholden to none.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.873
Not living by another's leave.

31:55.455 --> 31:57.455
The name was Cameron.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.462
John and Alexandra Cameron.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.349
My father's people say that
at the birth of the sun,

32:30.449 --> 32:34.444
and of his brother, the
moon, their mother died.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.730
So the sun gave to the earth her body,

32:36.830 --> 32:39.720
from which was to spring all life.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.947
And he drew forth from
her breast the stars.

32:44.379 --> 32:49.819
The stars, he threw into the night
sky to remind him of her soul.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.780
So there's the Camerons' monument.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.896
My folks' too,
I guess.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.410
You are right, Mr. Poe.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.400
We do not understand
what is happening here.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.443
And it's not as I imagined it would be,

33:23.543 --> 33:25.821
thinking of it in Boston and London.

33:25.921 --> 33:26.988
Sorry to disappoint you.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.088
No, on the contrary.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.908
It is more deeply
stirring to my blood...

33:35.180 --> 33:39.090
...than any imagining
could possibly have been.

34:18.889 --> 34:22.969
Top of the next ridge.
The fort's downhill of it.

34:23.812 --> 34:27.174
The men of the regiment
will fetch water from the lake,

34:27.274 --> 34:31.438
build fires, and provide
every comfort and desire.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.864
I cannot wait to see Papa.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.699
Fire.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.486
Prepare. Point. Fire.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.566
Open up.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.721
I'm Major Duncan Hayward.

38:42.821 --> 38:43.888
Captain Jeffrey Beams.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.307
Didn't expect you to make it through.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.407
Let's go to Munro.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.299
Hello, boys.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.261
Nathaniel.

39:09.139 --> 39:11.519
I need to talk to you, Jack.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.086
Uncas Thought you and Nathaniel
weren't joining up.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.186
We didn't.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.807
Papa. Papa.

39:27.907 --> 39:31.036
Alice. Cora.
Why are you here?

39:31.327 --> 39:34.727
And where the hell
are my reinforcements?

39:37.417 --> 39:39.417
Get Mr. Phelps.

39:41.588 --> 39:46.008
Told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?

39:46.134 --> 39:47.786
When? How? I...

39:47.886 --> 39:48.953
My letter.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.455
There was none.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.873
What?
There was no letter.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.458
I sent three couriers to Webb.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.001
One called Magua arrived.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.503
He delivered no such message.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.171
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?

39:58.271 --> 39:59.756
Sir, Webb has no idea.

39:59.856 --> 40:04.361
And he certainly does not
know to send reinforcements.

40:12.869 --> 40:13.895
What happened to you?

40:13.995 --> 40:16.147
On the George Road.
Attacked.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.247
We're fine.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.333
Are you all right?
Yes.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.946
What will happen here, Papa?

40:23.046 --> 40:24.239
We'll be all right, girl.

40:24.339 --> 40:27.450
This Magua led us into it.
Eighteen killed.

40:27.550 --> 40:31.460
These men came to our aid.
They guided us here.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.440
Thank you.
Do you need anything?

40:37.519 --> 40:40.463
Help ourselves to a few horns
from your powder stores.

40:40.563 --> 40:41.923
Some food.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.023
Indebted to you.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.362
Miss Cora, how are you?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.641
Hello, Mr. Phelps.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.518
Mrs. McCann will get some
dry clothes for you.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.618
Thank you.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.417
Go with your sister, Alice.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.211
It'll be all right, girl.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.880
It'll be all right.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.465
Might I inquire after the situation, sir,

41:23.565 --> 41:27.302
given that I've seen the French
engineering from the ridge above?

41:27.402 --> 41:31.347
The situation is, his guns are bigger
than mine and he has more of them.

41:31.447 --> 41:35.476
We keep our heads down while his
troops dig 30 yards of trench a day.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.021
When those trenches are 200 yards
from the fort and within range,

41:38.121 --> 41:39.564
he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars,

41:39.664 --> 41:44.152
lob explosive rounds over our walls
and pound us to dust.

41:44.252 --> 41:46.802
They look to be 300 yards out.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.824
If they're digging 30 yards
a day, you have three days.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.518
Damn. Damn.

41:52.927 --> 41:56.289
This man here can make a run
straight through to Webb.

41:56.389 --> 41:59.334
Three days is not enough time to get to
Albany and back with reinforcements.

41:59.434 --> 42:05.131
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the
60th to Fort Edward two days ago.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.674
Webb is at Edward?

42:06.774 --> 42:07.801
Yes, sir.

42:07.901 --> 42:09.385
That's only 12 miles away.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.263
He could have reinforcements
here the day after tomorrow.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.391
You, sir, pick your man.
Major Hayward will provide a diversion.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.893
I'll draft out a dispatch.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.896
Captain Beams will seek you
out and give it to you later.

42:19.996 --> 42:23.991
Something else. Cameron's cabin.
Frontier cabin.

42:24.125 --> 42:28.029
Came upon it yesterday.
It was burnt out, everyone murdered.

42:28.129 --> 42:31.189
It was Ottawa, allied to the French.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.802
Aye.

42:37.639 --> 42:39.639
So?

42:42.477 --> 42:43.920
It was a war party.

42:44.020 --> 42:48.258
That means they're gonna be
attacking up and down the frontier.

42:48.358 --> 42:49.676
Thank you, sir.

42:49.776 --> 42:53.805
People here, Mohawks, settlers,
have family out there.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.905
That'll be all, sir.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.476
Things were done.
Nobody was spared.

43:12.173 --> 43:15.994
Those considerations are subordinate
to the interests of the Crown.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.414
A terrible feature of war here
in the Americas, Major Hayward.

43:19.514 --> 43:24.104
Best keep your eye fixed on
our duty, to defeat France.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.114
That hangs on a courier to Webb.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.949
For my children are the
children of the true faith.

43:55.049 --> 43:58.279
My friendship and esteem is boundless.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.289
Tomorrow, I will sing
the war song with you...

44:01.389 --> 44:03.854
...at the great council fire.

44:13.026 --> 44:17.372
Magua, how are things
with your English friends?

44:18.281 --> 44:20.281
We're at one.
Join us.

44:22.034 --> 44:25.009
Hear what Le Subtil has to tell us.

44:27.123 --> 44:32.403
The English war chief, Webb, goes
to Fort Edward with 60th Regiment.

44:32.503 --> 44:36.657
He does not know that my father's army
attacks Fort William Henry.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.757
Magua was successful?

44:40.303 --> 44:43.873
The other two couriers died in the forest.

44:44.599 --> 44:48.920
By now, Munro would know his
dispatch did not get through.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.797
He'll send another.

44:50.897 --> 44:52.897
Grey Hair will try.

44:53.524 --> 44:57.859
Four or five, including two
women, entered the fort.

44:57.945 --> 45:00.974
The Grey Hair's children
were under Magua's knife.

45:01.074 --> 45:03.074
They escaped.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.497
They will be under it again.

45:05.995 --> 45:09.140
Why do you hate the Grey Hair, Magua?

45:10.875 --> 45:15.295
When the Grey Hair is dead,
Magua will eat his heart.

45:15.505 --> 45:17.505
Before he dies,

45:17.965 --> 45:21.620
Magua will put his children
under the knife,

45:21.761 --> 45:26.521
so the Grey Hair will know his
seed is wiped out forever.

45:28.059 --> 45:32.734
My engineers are advancing the
trench through the night.

45:34.106 --> 45:37.081
You may have your opportunity soon.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.702
Miss Cora.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.440
Gentleman looking for you.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.540
Miss Munro.
Hello.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.170
May I?

46:10.393 --> 46:12.795
It will seep, and then it's going to draw.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.255
Thank you, miss.

46:14.355 --> 46:17.840
About done holding hands with Miss Munro?

46:18.484 --> 46:20.484
We got some work to do.

46:36.544 --> 46:39.009
What are you looking at, sir?

46:39.797 --> 46:41.922
I'm looking at you, miss.

47:20.129 --> 47:22.448
Munro refused to believe what happened.

47:22.548 --> 47:25.353
He does not even want to hear it.

47:27.303 --> 47:29.428
Well, he's gonna have to.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.084
Get together by the west bastion.

47:33.184 --> 47:36.754
Ian, Sharitarish, Ongewasgone and William.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.776
Tight weave?

47:44.111 --> 47:46.159
Silk.
Another 40 yards.

48:54.473 --> 48:56.959
And how am I to know it
wasn't a raid by common thieves?

48:57.059 --> 49:00.880
The cabin was attacked by a
war party fighting with the French.

49:00.980 --> 49:02.715
They're sweeping south down the frontier...

49:02.815 --> 49:04.508
...attacking farms and Mohawk villages.

49:04.608 --> 49:05.760
All the men are stuck here.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.679
I need proof more convincing
than this man's opinion,

49:08.779 --> 49:11.599
before I weaken the fort's
defenses by releasing the militia.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.976
Chingachgook's of the same
opinion about the raid.

49:14.076 --> 49:16.062
Taken together, that's gospel.

49:16.162 --> 49:19.023
Your fort will stand or fall
depending on Webb's reinforcements,

49:19.123 --> 49:20.608
not the presence of the colonials.

49:20.708 --> 49:23.528
I judge military matters here, not you.

49:23.628 --> 49:25.947
Your judgment is not more important
than their right,

49:26.047 --> 49:29.283
under agreement with Webb to
defend their farms and families.

49:29.383 --> 49:32.870
Major Heyward was there.
He was at John Cameron's. Ha saw what it was.

49:32.970 --> 49:35.690
What exactly did you see, Major?

49:42.063 --> 49:44.090
I saw nothing that would lead me...

49:44.190 --> 49:45.967
...to the conclusion
it was other than a raid...

49:46.067 --> 49:48.261
...by savages bent on thievery.

49:48.361 --> 49:50.137
You're a liar.

49:50.237 --> 49:52.237
Major.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.767
Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman,
not a butcher.

49:54.867 --> 49:55.893
Easy for you to suppose.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.229
It's their women and children
alone on the farms, not yours.

49:58.329 --> 49:59.855
You forget yourself, sir.

49:59.955 --> 50:01.274
We're not forgetting Webb's promise.

50:01.374 --> 50:04.986
British promises are honored, and
the militia will not be released,

50:05.086 --> 50:07.572
because I need more definite
proof than this man's word.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.281
Nathaniel's word's been
good on this frontier...

50:09.381 --> 50:10.699
...a long time before you got here.

50:10.799 --> 50:13.578
This meeting is over.
The militia stays.

50:13.678 --> 50:17.503
Does the rule of English
law no longer govern?

50:17.598 --> 50:19.458
Has it been replaced by absolutism?

50:19.558 --> 50:20.626
If English law cannot be trusted,

50:20.726 --> 50:21.752
maybe these people would do better...

50:21.852 --> 50:23.003
...making their own peace with the French.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.171
That is sedition I

50:24.271 --> 50:25.297
That is the truth.

50:25.397 --> 50:28.457
I'll have you beaten from this fort.

50:31.362 --> 50:34.307
Someday I think you and I are gonna
have a serious disagreement.

50:34.407 --> 50:37.268
Anyone fomenting on advocating the
leaving of Fort William Henry...

50:37.368 --> 50:38.519
...will be hung for sedition.

50:38.619 --> 50:41.522
Anyone actually caught leaving
will be shot for desertion.

50:41.622 --> 50:43.622
My decision is final.

50:43.749 --> 50:45.749
Get out.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.300
Cora?

50:58.055 --> 51:00.095
I wanted to talk to you.

51:02.143 --> 51:04.143
Talk with Duncan, Cora.

51:05.479 --> 51:09.008
I must manage.
I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.

51:09.108 --> 51:10.092
Alice.

51:10.192 --> 51:13.422
I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything.

51:13.487 --> 51:15.952
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

51:17.992 --> 51:20.269
Cora, when we come
together back in England...

51:20.369 --> 51:22.521
...and are married and
away from this place,

51:22.621 --> 51:25.608
what had to be done and said
here will matter not at all.

51:25.708 --> 51:26.859
I'm certain of that.

51:26.959 --> 51:29.764
Duncan, I promised you an answer.

51:31.297 --> 51:34.450
You've complimented me with
your persistence and patience.

51:34.550 --> 51:35.910
But the decision I have come to...

51:36.010 --> 51:37.828
...is that I'd rather make
the gravest of mistakes...

51:37.928 --> 51:41.073
...than to surrender my own judgment.

51:42.391 --> 51:45.211
Please take this as my final answer.

51:45.311 --> 51:47.311
It must be no.

51:49.732 --> 51:51.732
I see.

52:47.247 --> 52:50.150
Yeah, Nathaniel, but you
weren't ever for being here.

52:50.250 --> 52:52.703
That's right.
I saw it that way than and

52:52.803 --> 52:54.155
I see it that way now.

52:54.255 --> 52:56.031
Ian, if I had kin in the settlements,

52:56.131 --> 52:57.992
hell be damn sure I'd belong gone.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.536
What do we do about being under Crown law?

53:00.636 --> 53:04.915
I believe if they set aside
their law as and when they wish,

53:05.015 --> 53:08.627
their law no longer has
rightful authority over us.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.380
All they have over us then is tyranny.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.924
And I will not live under that yoke.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.574
So I will stay here no longer.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.054
Anyone caught leaving the fort could be shot,

53:19.154 --> 53:21.140
so each man make your own decision.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.559
Those who are going, be back in an hour.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.644
Out the northern sally port.

53:25.744 --> 53:27.438
Strike for the east side of the swamp...

53:27.538 --> 53:29.315
...till you clear the French picket line.

53:29.415 --> 53:32.651
Head north over the ridge,
than come about southeast.

53:32.751 --> 53:36.697
Fork left in Little Meadow and you're
free of the outpost and skirmishes.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.949
Should've gotten out of this long ago.

53:39.049 --> 53:43.704
Got no families, Captain.
Figured we'd stay and give a hand.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.748
I'll cover you from the top of the bastion.

53:45.848 --> 53:47.249
You're not coming with us?

53:47.349 --> 53:49.349
I got a reason to stay.

53:49.810 --> 53:52.421
That reason wear a striped
skirt and work in the surgery?

53:52.521 --> 53:53.672
It does.

53:53.772 --> 53:58.260
No offense, but it's a better-looking
reason than you, Jack Winthrop.

53:58.360 --> 54:02.681
Push hard, 'cause you got to clear
the French outpost by dawn.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.781
Good luck, Jack.

54:11.957 --> 54:13.442
Ongewasgone, are you staying?

54:13.542 --> 54:14.568
Yes.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.111
There's too many French.

54:16.211 --> 54:18.072
And so few of us to fight.

54:18.172 --> 54:23.952
Not too many to die. But we've given
our word to our English fathers.

57:46.255 --> 57:48.255
You, sir.
As you were.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.551
Stand off.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.309
Take him.

58:09.611 --> 58:11.611
As you were.

58:29.673 --> 58:32.201
He saved us.
We're alive only because of him.

58:32.301 --> 58:33.911
The man encouraged the colonials to desert,

58:34.011 --> 58:36.789
in this very room, and in my presence.

58:36.889 --> 58:38.707
Sir.
He is guilty of sedition.

58:38.807 --> 58:40.501
He must be tried and hanged
like any other criminal,

58:40.601 --> 58:42.502
regardless of what he did for my children.

58:42.602 --> 58:45.255
But he knew the consequences and he stayed.

58:45.355 --> 58:48.415
Are those the actions of a criminal?

58:49.359 --> 58:50.344
Duncan, do something.

58:50.444 --> 58:52.304
He knew the penalty for his actions.

58:52.404 --> 58:55.182
He ought to pay without sending you to beg.

58:55.282 --> 58:59.269
You know he wouldn't send me.
You falsely spoke of what you saw.

58:59.369 --> 59:01.688
What happened at the farm
was as Nathaniel said.

59:01.788 --> 59:05.692
But not with enough certainty to
outweigh British interests in this fort.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.445
And who empowered these
colonials to pass judgment...

59:08.545 --> 59:11.073
...on England's policies
in her own possessions,

59:11.173 --> 59:14.451
and to come and go without so
much as a 'By your leave'?

59:14.551 --> 59:17.537
They do not live
their lives by your leave.

59:17.637 --> 59:20.040
They hack it out of the wilderness
with their own two hands,

59:20.140 --> 59:21.541
bearing their children along the way.

59:21.641 --> 59:26.996
You are defending him because
you've become infatuated with him.

59:27.731 --> 59:32.151
Duncan, you are a man
with a few admirable qualities.

59:32.486 --> 59:35.305
But taken as a whole, I was wrong
to have thought so highly of you.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.405
Cora.

59:40.243 --> 59:44.857
Cora, I would do anything I could
to keep you from being hurt.

59:44.957 --> 59:46.858
But this man is guilty of sedition...

59:46.958 --> 59:49.319
...and subject to military
justice and beyond pardon.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.419
Justice?

59:51.505 --> 59:52.489
If that's justice,

59:52.589 --> 59:55.158
then the sooner French guns blow
the English army out of America,

59:55.258 --> 59:56.744
the better it will be for the people here.

59:56.844 --> 59:58.203
You do not know what you're saying.
Yes, I do.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.621
I know exactly what I'm saying.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:04.396
And if it is sedition, then I
am guilty of sedition too.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:36.424
They're going to hang you.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:43.251
Why didn't you leave
when you had the chance?

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:49.299
Because what I'm interested
in is right here.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.688
What can I do?

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.468
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:57.763
If they do not arrive, the
fort will fall to the French.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:01.308
If that happens, stay close to your father.

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:02.976
Stay close to him.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:06.814
The French officers will try to protect
the officers among the English.

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:09.042
No. I will find you.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:11.291
Do not.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.588
Promise me.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.314
The whole world's on fire.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.529
What is it?

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.323
Remember what I told you.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:12.021
Stay close to your
father and the officers.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:10.997
Colonel Munro, I have known
you as a gallant antagonist.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:14.000
I am happy to make your
acquaintance as a friend.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.294
And I yours, monsieur Le Marquis.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.338
Please accept my compliments...

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:21.883
...for the strong and skillful
defense of your fortress.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.969
Under the command of a lesser man,

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:26.263
it would have fallen long ago,

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:29.848
given the superior numbers and materials.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:32.686
Chance has allowed me
to array against you.

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:36.690
Monsieur Le Marquis, I am a
soldier, not a diplomat.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.608
You called this parley
for a better reason...

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.683
...than an exchange of compliments.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:47.534
You have already done everything which is
necessary for the honor of your prince.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:51.538
But now I beg you to listen to
the admonishments of humanity.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:54.708
I beg you to consider my
terms for your surrender.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:58.044
Perhaps the general's glass
can reach as far as the Hudson...

01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:02.734
...and seize the size and
eminence of the army of Webb?

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:08.737
My scouts intercepted this
dispatch intended for you.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.766
Capitaine de Bougainville.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:15.645
'To Colonel Munro.
Sir, I regret to inform you...

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:19.024
'that I have no men available
to send to your rescue.

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:20.817
'It is quite impossible.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.904
'I advise you to seek
terms for surrender.

01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:27.258
'I remain.
Jerome Webb at Fort Edward. '

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.231
This is the signature of Webb.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.918
And I know the temper of our men.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:41.796
Rather than spend the war in a
French prison hulk in Hudson Bay,

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.298
they'd fight to the end.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.300
You've had your answer,
monsieur Le Marquis.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.262
Sir, I beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many...

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:53.442
...until you have listened
to what I have to say.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.105
Go on.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:03.151
None of your men will see
the inside of a prison barge.

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:07.155
They are free, so long as
they return to England...

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:09.699
...and fight no more on this continent,

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:13.709
and the civilian militia
return to their farms.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:16.331
Their arms?

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:19.746
They may leave
the fortress fully armed.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.628
My colors?

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:24.533
Carry them to England with pride.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.712
Allow me to consult with my officers.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:44.818
I have lived to see something
which I never expected.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:47.362
A British officer
afraid to support another.

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:49.072
Webb can bum in hell.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:54.102
And we'll go back and dig our
graves behind those ramparts.

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:59.166
Death and honor are
thought to be the same,

01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:02.335
but today I have learned
that sometimes they are not.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.435
Sir...

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:18.101
Monsieur Le Marquis,
I am deeply touched...

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.941
...by such unusual and
unexpected generosity.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:24.482
My fort is yours under the condition...

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.776
...that I be given till dawn
to bury my dead,

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:30.280
to prepare my men and women
for the long journey ahead...

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.375
...and to hand my wounded
over to your surgeons.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.592
Granted, monsieur.

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:09.777
Is the hatchet buried between the
English and my French father?

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.071
Yes.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:15.533
Not a warrior has a scalp and
the white men become friends.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:17.930
My master owns these lands,

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:21.997
and I have been ordered to drive
off the English squatters.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.308
They have consented to go,

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:26.752
so now I call them enemies no longer.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:30.423
Magua took the hatchet
to color with blood.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.107
It's still bright.

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:36.095
Only when it's red,
then it will be buried.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:40.701
So many suns have set since
Magua struck the war post.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.825
And where is that sun?

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.562
Magua is the son of his people...

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.482
...and he has come to lead many of them.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:51.694
But Magua has power with his
Huron people and others here,

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:53.795
I know well.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:03.856
Magua's village and lodges were burnt.

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:09.921
Magua's children were
killed by the English.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:16.919
I was taken as slave by the Mohawk
who fought for the Grey Hair.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.328
Magua's wife believed he was dead...

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:27.884
...and became the wife of another.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:32.484
The Grey Hair was the
father of all that.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.585
In time,

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:39.805
Magua became blood brother to
the Mohawk to become free.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.822
But always in his heart, he is Huron.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:50.341
And his heart will be
whole again on the day...

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:55.007
...the Grey Hair and
all his seed are dead.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:02.223
Does the chief of the Canadas believe
the English will keep the terms?

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:06.499
I fear having let them go, which I must,

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:12.393
I will only fight the same men
again when I drive towards Albany.

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:18.448
But I cannot break the
term of the surrender...

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.438
...and sully the lilies of France.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:04.264
Monsieur, the fort is yours.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:25.819
Left three ranks, make ready.

01:13:26.528 --> 01:13:28.528
Aim, set.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.499
Fire.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.903
Present, fire.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:00.197
Fire.

01:17:00.992 --> 01:17:02.992
Fire.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.830
Full company.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.130
Grey Hair, before you die,

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.133
know that I will put under
the knife your children,

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:38.228
so I will wipe your seed
from the Earth forever.

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:06.138
Leave her alone.

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:05.229
When you fall into British hands
again, I'll have you hanged.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.518
Faster.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.240
Head to the river.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:44.902
Where are we going?
- - Nowhere.

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:46.153
I don't understand.

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.030
This is as far as we go

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.406
If we're lucky,
they'll figure we beached...

01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:51.283
...our canoes and headed cross land.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:53.786
If we're very lucky, they'll
figure we went over the falls.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.955
Our only hope is that they pass us by.

01:22:56.055 --> 01:22:57.331
If they do?

01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:59.625
Take the south rim down the mountain.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:02.419
It's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:04.519
And if they don't?

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:09.902
You'll just have to forego
the pleasure of hanging me.

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.572
Powder?

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:27.084
Gone.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.921
Mine's soaking wet.

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.548
Our father...

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:36.551
Did you see my father?

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.846
From a distance.

01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:12.129
Say nothing to Alice.

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:36.361
Get back.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:32.256
Yes. Go ahead.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.322
What the bloody hell plan is this?

01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:36.448
I want you to go.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:39.284
If we go, there's a chance
there won't be a fight.

01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:42.454
There's no powder.
If we don't go in that, there's no chance.

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.682
None. You understand?

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:46.125
Coward.

01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:50.305
You've done everything you can do.
Save yourself.

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:53.966
If the worst happens...

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.066
You stay alive.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:26:00.139
If they don't kill you, they'll take
you north up to the Huron lands.

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:04.234
Submit, do you hear?
You're strong. You survive.

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:08.849
You stay alive, no matter what occurs.

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:11.790
I will find you,

01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:15.994
no matter how long it
takes, no matter how far.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.880
I will find you.

01:33:53.003 --> 01:33:54.613
I don't speak Huron.
Do you speak French, Major?

01:33:54.713 --> 01:33:55.780
Yes.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.783
Translate for me into French
every word as I say it.

01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:04.238
I come to you unarmed and in peace
to unstuff your ears, Sachem.

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:07.459
Let the children of the
dead Colonel Munro go free.

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:08.960
Take fire out of the English anger...

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.545
...over the murder of
their helpless ones.

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:26.686
Sachem, the French fathers made peace.
Magua broke it.

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:31.971
It is false that the French will
befriends still to the Huron.

01:35:43.613 --> 01:35:48.309
Would Magua use the ways of les
français and the Yengeese?

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:49.936
Would you?
Yes.

01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:52.397
Would the Huron make his Algonquin
brothers foolish with brandy...

01:35:52.497 --> 01:35:56.651
...and steal his lands to sell
them for gold to the white man?

01:35:56.751 --> 01:36:01.426
Would Huron have greed for
more land than a man can use?

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.033
Would Huron fool Seneca into taking...

01:36:03.133 --> 01:36:04.909
...all the furs of all the
animals of the forest...

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:07.579
...for beads and strong whiskey?

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:11.249
Those are the ways of the
Yengeese and the français traders...

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:16.959
...and their masters in Europe infected
with the sickness of greed.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:19.397
Magua's heart is twisted.

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:23.513
He would make himself
into what twisted him.

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:26.639
I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese.

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:30.268
Hawkeye, adopted son
of Chingachgook of the Mohican people.

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:31.645
Let the children of the dead Munro...

01:36:31.745 --> 01:36:34.805
...and the Yengeese officer go free.

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:37.442
This belt, which is
a record of the days...

01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:41.367
...of my father's people,
speaks for my truth.

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:41.549
Tell him I'll trade him.
Me for her. Say it.

01:37:56.079 --> 01:37:57.564
Stop it.

01:37:57.664 --> 01:37:59.758
I am La Longue Carabine.

01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:03.827
My death is a great honor
to the Huron. Take me.

01:38:04.003 --> 01:38:06.003
Did you tell him?

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:10.216
Yes.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.230
Stop.

01:38:26.651 --> 01:38:28.651
I said to take me.

01:38:29.154 --> 01:38:30.180
Take me.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.390
My compliments, sir.
Take her and get out.

01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:37.250
Duncan... What are they doing to Duncan?
Where's Alice?

01:38:37.954 --> 01:38:39.954
Alice.

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:55.250
Uncas.

01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:12.148
Great Spirit and maker of all life,

01:47:15.304 --> 01:47:17.415
a warrior goes to you swift and straight...

01:47:17.515 --> 01:47:20.320
...as an arrow shot into the sun.

01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:24.088
Welcome him, and let him take his place...

01:47:24.188 --> 01:47:27.248
...at the council fire of my people.

01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:30.651
He is Uncas,

01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:34.029
my son

01:47:34.698 --> 01:47:38.608
Tell him to be patient
and ask death for speed,

01:47:39.203 --> 01:47:41.838
for they are all there but one,

01:47:42.998 --> 01:47:47.879
I, Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans.
