WEBVTT

00:05.301 --> 00:08.035
Oh, we respect her.
It's you we don't respect.

00:09.437 --> 00:10.938
Anyhoo...

00:11.072 --> 00:13.740
See, we don't respect you,
'cause you say things like that.

00:15.076 --> 00:18.536
Oh, yay. I'm in the Wizards' Lair,

00:18.571 --> 00:21.880
or as I like to call it,
"the garage sale that never happened."

00:23.509 --> 00:24.951
OK, guys, now listen up.

00:24.985 --> 00:26.670
Dad wants me to teach
the lesson today

00:27.272 --> 00:29.186
while he's away at the No
Wizard Left Behind Conference.

00:30.700 --> 00:33.560
So, let's get this over with.
OK, uh...

00:33.594 --> 00:35.002
What is wizard wear?

00:35.036 --> 00:36.411
Max.

00:36.445 --> 00:37.990
Alex is on my side of the bench.

00:38.025 --> 00:39.327
You don't own the bench, Max.

00:39.361 --> 00:40.430
That side, I do.

00:40.601 --> 00:41.933
[Justin] You are being childish!

00:41.967 --> 00:43.628
[all arguing]

00:43.663 --> 00:46.407
Don't make me stand up!

00:46.441 --> 00:48.482
That's it. I quit!

00:48.516 --> 00:50.157
Justin, it's all yours.

00:52.767 --> 00:55.909
She, uh, lasted a lot longer
than Dad said she would.

00:57.649 --> 00:59.352
[beeping]

01:02.329 --> 01:05.370
Today, we continue with
magical wizard garments.

01:05.404 --> 01:07.142
Having covered... [creaks]

01:07.176 --> 01:11.219
...armor, we move on to sportswear.

01:13.927 --> 01:15.396
This is a speed shirt,

01:15.430 --> 01:17.301
it gives you supersonic speed.

01:17.336 --> 01:19.843
Does it grow your hair really long?

01:21.114 --> 01:23.452
Speed shirt.

01:24.522 --> 01:25.792
[clears throat]

01:25.993 --> 01:28.030
Now watch how fast I can
run into the sub shop,

01:28.064 --> 01:30.136
make a sandwich and come back.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.474
OK. Ready?

01:34.179 --> 01:35.949
Done!

01:35.983 --> 01:37.787
No way.

01:37.821 --> 01:39.791
Yes way.

01:39.825 --> 01:41.929
Wow.

01:41.963 --> 01:43.999
You forgot the cheese.

01:44.034 --> 01:45.704
Oh! Hang on.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.446
Is that enough cheese for you?
I think so.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.083
Nice.

01:53.153 --> 01:55.957
OK. Item two...

01:55.991 --> 01:57.559
It's called a "Night Cap."

01:57.594 --> 01:59.363
Whoever wears it falls
asleep instantly.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.200
Well, are you going
to keep teaching?

02:01.334 --> 02:03.437
'Cause I wanna be asleep
for that. Hand it over.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.709
Oh, I'm tempted, but then you
wouldn't know about these.

02:07.846 --> 02:09.481
[shouts]

02:10.650 --> 02:12.920
Smarty Pants.

02:14.725 --> 02:17.428
They give whoever wears them
superior knowledge on anything

02:17.463 --> 02:19.465
and everything there is to know.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.837
I'd put them on, but I'm
already smarter than them.

02:22.871 --> 02:26.877
Ooh, you're smarter than pants.
Good for you.

02:26.911 --> 02:28.479
Now pay attention while I read off

02:28.714 --> 02:30.416
some of the possible
side effects of keeping

02:30.450 --> 02:32.920
the pants on too long.
Side effects may be:

02:32.954 --> 02:36.224
Headache, nausea, rash, chronic giggling,
belly-button bubbles,

02:36.259 --> 02:37.760
"say it don't spray it" disease,

02:38.062 --> 02:39.964
tongue reversal,
ear gas, sweaty knees,

02:39.998 --> 02:43.702
Picasso face,
problems with the bowel...

02:43.737 --> 02:45.538
All right, lesson's over.
Come on, Max.

02:45.573 --> 02:46.874
I think I'm gonna stay

02:47.008 --> 02:48.877
- and draw on his face.
- OK, cool.

02:48.911 --> 02:51.447
* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:51.482 --> 02:53.585
* And the end will no doubt,
justify the means *

02:54.020 --> 02:55.988
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

02:56.323 --> 02:58.724
* Yes please But you might find
out it'll go to your head *

02:58.760 --> 03:01.229
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

03:01.264 --> 03:04.135
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

03:04.169 --> 03:05.670
* That's what I said *

03:05.772 --> 03:08.642
* Everything is not what it seems *

03:08.676 --> 03:12.448
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

03:12.482 --> 03:16.252
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

03:16.287 --> 03:20.689
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

03:20.724 --> 03:23.893
* Everything is not what it seems *

03:23.928 --> 03:28.131
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

03:28.166 --> 03:31.736
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

03:31.771 --> 03:35.675
* Because everything is not... *

03:35.709 --> 03:37.711
* What it seems *

03:37.815 --> 03:42.718

03:42.752 --> 03:45.055
Alfred, the plan was,
if you're going to be ref,

03:45.089 --> 03:46.325
you wouldn't have thrown
me out of the game.

03:46.659 --> 03:49.996
Hey, when I put this shirt on,
the friendship goes away.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.735
Hey, look at the line
for the water fountain.

03:53.770 --> 03:55.571
Oh, wow.

03:57.675 --> 04:01.614
Hey, Zeke, what's with the line?
Are the other ones broken?

04:01.648 --> 04:04.718
Nope. The water that comes out of
this one is the best in the school.

04:04.752 --> 04:07.288
I don't get it. Water is water.

04:07.323 --> 04:11.694
I beg to differ.
This water is delicious.

04:11.728 --> 04:15.231
Excuse me, sheriff's in town.

04:15.265 --> 04:18.632
Step away from the watering hole.

04:22.837 --> 04:26.072
Now that is some fine H-2-0.

04:26.106 --> 04:28.140
[bell rings]

04:28.174 --> 04:29.708
[all groaning]

04:29.742 --> 04:31.843
If I could figure out a
way to bottle this stuff,

04:31.877 --> 04:33.611
I could make a fortune.

04:33.645 --> 04:35.279
You can bottle it.

04:35.313 --> 04:38.549
Alfred, don't bother me.
I'm thinking.

04:38.584 --> 04:42.522
Hey, Alex. Are you as excited as
I am about the Tribeca Quiz Bowl?

04:42.556 --> 04:45.224
Oh, my gosh! No!

04:45.258 --> 04:47.626
You're excited.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.727
Who wouldn't be?
It's an academic decathlon.

04:49.762 --> 04:51.562
And when I take my team to victory,

04:51.596 --> 04:53.330
people are gonna know me as Harper,

04:53.364 --> 04:55.232
the girl who's got the brains,

04:55.399 --> 04:58.734
and not just Harper,
the girl who's the fashion dynamo.

04:58.768 --> 05:02.003
Harper, if you want people
to notice that you're smart,

05:02.037 --> 05:03.971
you might want to wear
a little less produce.

05:04.006 --> 05:06.174
[scoffs] That's not gonna happen.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.343
Papayas just came into season.

05:09.377 --> 05:11.445
Well, I'd like to be known as Alex,

05:11.479 --> 05:13.479
the girl who doesn't
care what she's known as.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.314
- You are known as that.
- I don't care.

05:16.348 --> 05:19.917
See? It looked like I really didn't
care there for a second. It was good.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.787
Oh my gosh, there's Dean.
I hope he knows me.

05:23.588 --> 05:24.955
[Harper] Dean Moriarty?

05:24.990 --> 05:26.357
You don't want to know him.

05:26.558 --> 05:30.192
I hear he plays with firecrackers.

05:30.227 --> 05:32.159
Dean Moriarty.

05:33.561 --> 05:36.462
I was wondering if you could
be a good little kemo sabe

05:36.496 --> 05:39.964
and rustle up some students
to help gussy up the gym

05:39.999 --> 05:42.632
for the big Quiz Bowl this year.

05:42.666 --> 05:45.066
You gotta slow down, Mr. Laritate.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.434
I'm only in my first
semester of cowboy.

05:49.937 --> 05:54.005
All right, Dean. You and your whole
posse are all on set-up patrol.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.208
Hey, setting up might be all right.
What time should we be there?

05:58.242 --> 06:01.344
What? You'll do it?

06:01.378 --> 06:03.579
That was a lasso toss in the dark.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.214
I'll meet you at 3:00.

06:05.248 --> 06:07.916
Moriarty, you're
turning into a citizen.

06:09.752 --> 06:12.520
Looks like I'll be helping set up
the gym for Quiz Bowl this year.

06:12.554 --> 06:15.422
Why do I have a feeling you're just
doing that to get to know Dean?

06:15.456 --> 06:17.790
'Cause I'm making
it pretty obvious.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.061
- Hey, Dean.
- What's up, Russo?

06:22.095 --> 06:24.629
- Yeah, what's up, Russo?
- She's cool.

06:24.664 --> 06:27.365
She's cool. She's cool.
Clear some space.

06:28.834 --> 06:32.136
So, um, I hear you're setting up
the gym for Quiz Bowl this year.

06:32.171 --> 06:34.639
That's kind of my thing,
maybe we should talk about that

06:34.740 --> 06:37.341
and see how it's going to work.
Wanna thumb wrestle for it?

06:37.375 --> 06:38.742
Cute.

06:38.776 --> 06:40.543
[giggles] Oh, I know.

06:42.980 --> 06:45.881
Most chicks don't like to get down
and dirty with how things work.

06:45.916 --> 06:48.083
They usually just make
posters and gossip.

06:48.351 --> 06:51.652
Really? 'Cause it sounds like you're
gossiping about chicks right now.

06:51.686 --> 06:53.320
I'll be setting up
the big boy stuff.

06:53.921 --> 06:56.723
I'll get you some cardboard and
you can make yourself a poster.

07:01.794 --> 07:04.294
So, uh, Dean,
what are you thinking?

07:04.329 --> 07:06.863
I think I'm setting up for
the Quiz Bowl with Russo

07:06.897 --> 07:08.530
while you guys are making posters.

07:08.565 --> 07:10.365
Got it, Dean.

07:10.399 --> 07:12.301
Guys, we get to make posters!

07:12.335 --> 07:13.836
[all] Yeah!

07:15.000 --> 07:21.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

07:25.150 --> 07:27.784
- Whatcha doin'?
- What's it look like I'm doing?

07:27.818 --> 07:29.952
- I'm making a pizza.
- Watch it.

07:30.053 --> 07:32.755
I own sarcasm and didn't give
you permission to use it.

07:32.789 --> 07:34.490
Cute.

07:34.524 --> 07:36.158
Get used to it.

07:36.192 --> 07:38.293
OK, so, um,
what do you want me to do?

07:38.327 --> 07:41.195
You can finish wiring the
last buzzer for me. - OK.

07:41.229 --> 07:45.098
Green goes to red goes to blue, goes to
blue-red goes to green-red goes to
blue-green.

07:47.634 --> 07:51.435
Uh, OK, I missed all of that.
But, yeah, I'll figure it out. It's good.

07:55.472 --> 07:58.840
Oh, hey, Harper. Nice headband.
Are those real grapes?

07:58.874 --> 08:02.442
[scoffs] No. The real grapes
didn't survive the washing machine.

08:02.476 --> 08:03.743
But you know what?

08:03.777 --> 08:06.312
It took this...

08:06.347 --> 08:08.214
...to figure out this.

08:11.518 --> 08:13.819
Yes, it did, Harper.

08:13.853 --> 08:16.320
Do you mind if my team
practices our buzzer technique?

08:16.354 --> 08:18.288
Let me just hook this up first.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.525
And... Oh, that looks pretty. OK.

08:26.396 --> 08:29.231
All right, Team Maroon...
ready positions!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.099
This dangerous South
American spider

08:35.400 --> 08:38.501
is often found in boxes of exported fruit,
particularly bananas.

08:38.535 --> 08:39.769
[buzzers clang]

08:39.804 --> 08:42.171
[electrical zapping]

08:47.910 --> 08:52.013
Does anyone else's hair feel hot?

08:52.048 --> 08:54.416
What's happening?

08:56.218 --> 08:59.387
Don't look at me, I'm a girl.
I was just making posters.

09:00.689 --> 09:03.957
[theme music]

09:03.992 --> 09:06.826
Thank you very much, Alex.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.727
Nellie dropped out
of the Quiz Bowl.

09:08.762 --> 09:10.929
That whole buzzer
accident freaked her out.

09:10.964 --> 09:13.599
Oh, waa waa. She looks better
with her hair up anyway.

09:13.634 --> 09:16.702
Maybe if you weren't so concerned
with getting to know Dean,

09:16.737 --> 09:19.170
you would've hooked the
wires up the right way.

09:19.205 --> 09:22.406
Now, now, don't go blaming Dean,
I would've jacked that up anyway.

09:24.576 --> 09:27.377
And besides, can't you just get
someone to fill in for Nellie?

09:27.411 --> 09:30.915
No. Everyone in school is already on
their teams, so we have to forfeit.

09:30.949 --> 09:33.485
[groans] Justin's team is
probably gonna win now.

09:33.519 --> 09:35.186
Now I'll never get
a new reputation.

09:35.587 --> 09:38.522
It's really hard being known
just as the glamour girl.

09:42.328 --> 09:45.397
I wish you were smart,
then you could fill in for Nellie.

09:45.431 --> 09:47.065
I am smart.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.801
- I'm street smart.
- But not book smart.

09:49.835 --> 09:51.803
I am, too, book smart.

09:51.904 --> 09:55.439
Sure, I don't read books, but I hollow
them out and hide things in them.

09:56.808 --> 09:59.844
Hey, Harper. Heard about
Nellie's little, uh, "accident."

09:59.878 --> 10:02.914
Thank you, Alex. - Yeah, nice work.
Way to zap the competition.

10:02.948 --> 10:05.750
Hey, just because you're
winning through "forfeit,"

10:05.784 --> 10:08.886
doesn't mean you really win.
That's not a satisfying victory.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.621
Oh, well, I'm pretty satisfied,
how about you Zeke?

10:11.656 --> 10:13.957
I'm very satisfied,
thanks for asking.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.994
- Miss me high and hit me low.
- That's what I'm talking about.

10:19.029 --> 10:20.629
[both] Oh!

10:22.798 --> 10:25.366
Well, guess what?
You tools didn't win.

10:25.401 --> 10:28.803
Harper's team doesn't have to
forfeit because I just joined it.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.906
You? Come on, Alex.
You got a "D" in lunch.

10:32.940 --> 10:35.442
Ooh! Ouch! Fly it
by and hit me high!

10:35.476 --> 10:37.643
[both whoop] Oh!

10:37.678 --> 10:39.511
Oh, please.

10:39.545 --> 10:42.380
The Quiz Bowl is just a glorified
trivia game. I know stuff.

10:42.414 --> 10:46.350
You know what? Beating you in this
competition will be a delight.

10:46.384 --> 10:47.851
And to make things fair,

10:47.885 --> 10:49.486
- which I should,
- Mm-hmm.

10:49.887 --> 10:52.121
I'll even loan you my 15,
000 hand-written cross-referenced

10:52.156 --> 10:54.457
index cards of informacionica!

10:56.626 --> 11:01.663
Does one of those cards tell you
not to answer the phone, "Yello?"

11:01.697 --> 11:03.364
I can't wait for
this Quiz Bowl now.

11:04.032 --> 11:06.400
Zeke, are you feeling the need to
do what I'm feeling the need to do??

11:06.434 --> 11:08.568
- The need to blog about it?
- Oh, yes!

11:12.639 --> 11:14.306
Alex, what are you doing?

11:14.573 --> 11:17.842
You're just going to embarrass
yourself in front of everyone.

11:17.876 --> 11:19.676
I'm gonna have to hit the books.

11:19.711 --> 11:22.312
OK, but not the ones
that are hollowed out.

11:22.346 --> 11:24.547
No.

11:36.959 --> 11:38.425
[alarm sounds]

11:38.460 --> 11:40.293
[automated voice] Warning! Warning!

11:40.928 --> 11:43.730
- The prolonged use of Smarty Pants...
- Shh! OK, we get it!

11:43.764 --> 11:49.201
may cause side effects,
such as: headache, nausea,

11:49.235 --> 11:54.305
rash, skeleton legs,
belly-button bubbles,

11:54.339 --> 11:57.308
"say it don't spray it" disease,

11:57.342 --> 12:01.678
smelly feet, yellow toes,
flaky hair...

12:01.713 --> 12:03.713
Oh, now I know how to shut you up.

12:03.747 --> 12:05.447
...scaly pits... [shuts off]

12:06.249 --> 12:07.282
[laughs]

12:07.316 --> 12:09.249
Knowing stuff is so cool.

12:16.409 --> 12:17.709
What are you doing?

12:18.044 --> 12:20.578
Remember how people loved
the water-fountain water?

12:20.612 --> 12:24.181
I hauled this whole bucket
of it home from school.

12:24.215 --> 12:25.782
Now I'm going to bottle it,

12:25.817 --> 12:27.818
and I'm gonna sell it back to them.

12:29.588 --> 12:31.288
Why are you going
to all this trouble?

12:31.456 --> 12:33.290
Why don't you just
sell them bottled water

12:33.324 --> 12:35.325
and tell them it's
from the fountain?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.827
It all tastes the same.

12:38.930 --> 12:41.666
We know you have a lot of
choices for your fountain water,

12:41.700 --> 12:43.434
and we're glad you chose us.

12:45.003 --> 12:47.004
You guys are waiting in line
to buy this fountain water

12:47.305 --> 12:50.974
because you don't want to wait at the
fountain, meanwhile there's no line at the
fountain.

12:52.976 --> 12:54.576
Hey, hey! There's no line here now.

12:56.745 --> 12:58.446
Hey, guys! When we're
done with these,

12:58.814 --> 13:00.947
we can use our empties to fill
up at the fountain for free.

13:03.683 --> 13:07.853
- We just lost our business.
- What are we going to do?

13:07.887 --> 13:09.453
We gotta come up with something.

13:09.488 --> 13:11.222
Panic and run.
It's never not worked.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.913
Oh my gosh,

13:21.947 --> 13:24.148
this is such a big turnout!

13:27.952 --> 13:31.488
[sighs] I guess there's no point in
waiting around for more people...

13:33.557 --> 13:35.357
OK, calico kittens!

13:35.392 --> 13:40.594
Let's get ready to Qu-izzzzz Bowl!

13:44.366 --> 13:47.468
Quiz Bowl? What are we doing here?

13:47.502 --> 13:48.969
Uh... I, uh...

13:49.003 --> 13:52.604
I just wanted to come by to,
uh, see your poster.

13:52.639 --> 13:54.439
- Really?
- Sure.

13:58.009 --> 14:00.242
[all] One, two, three, win!

14:02.912 --> 14:04.679
Why are you rolling
those stretchies up?

14:04.713 --> 14:06.247
They're cute and really stand out,

14:06.515 --> 14:08.048
which a sign of a
really good stretchy.

14:08.083 --> 14:09.683
Oh! It's just hot in here,
you know?

14:09.817 --> 14:11.585
But, uh, remember,
this isn't about me.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.420
This is about everybody getting to
appreciate you for your brains and not just
your...

14:15.455 --> 14:18.322
- ...oranges.
- [scoffs] They're tangelos!

14:18.356 --> 14:19.956
But, thank you.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.558
Teams ready?

14:21.592 --> 14:23.493
Have some fun, take your time

14:23.527 --> 14:25.461
and remember, there are no losers.

14:25.562 --> 14:28.498
Only winners and the
people that aren't them.

14:28.532 --> 14:29.866
[Justin laughs]

14:29.901 --> 14:32.136
Question number one,
what umbrella term

14:32.170 --> 14:34.539
refers to the diseases of
the heart and blood vessels?

14:34.574 --> 14:35.640
[buzzer clangs]

14:35.675 --> 14:37.375
Cardiovascular disease.

14:37.409 --> 14:39.909
Correct.

14:43.346 --> 14:45.580
Nice, you studied.

14:45.614 --> 14:48.182
Yeah, that's what I did.

14:48.216 --> 14:49.817
Next question.

14:49.851 --> 14:51.852
How many distinct codon
sequences are there

14:51.887 --> 14:54.121
in an RNA messenger molecule?

14:54.890 --> 14:57.191
Eight or two cubed.

14:57.225 --> 14:58.658
[imitates buzzer]

14:59.960 --> 15:01.827
What did we say, Zeke?

15:01.861 --> 15:04.028
"If it's a guess, it's a mess."

15:06.365 --> 15:08.632
Sixty-four or four cubed.

15:08.666 --> 15:12.268
And Bingo was his name-o!

15:12.302 --> 15:15.670
[audience applauds]

15:15.704 --> 15:19.274
You can't see through these cards,
can you, Russo?

15:21.110 --> 15:22.911
Wow. How'd you know that?

15:23.045 --> 15:25.346
You're the one who said I studied.
Why are you asking me?

15:26.848 --> 15:28.915
Mr. Laritate, I should
get credit for this!

15:28.950 --> 15:30.718
She studied off of
my study cards...

15:30.986 --> 15:32.953
OK, look, I think we all
established that I studied.

15:32.987 --> 15:35.022
Mr. Laritate,
question three, please.

15:36.124 --> 15:37.724
Question three...

15:40.495 --> 15:42.229
Archimedes' Principle.

15:45.433 --> 15:50.369
9,476,251 micro-meters...

15:53.672 --> 15:55.072
Puppets.

15:59.743 --> 16:01.777
The Japanese pronunciation is,

16:01.812 --> 16:04.880
Dah-reh-kah ay-ee-goh
gah hah-nah-seh-mas-kah?

16:10.185 --> 16:13.253
My... study... cards.

16:22.728 --> 16:26.229
What are you doing? You answered
every single question in that round.

16:26.264 --> 16:29.131
Isn't that what you wanted?
You're on the winning team.

16:29.166 --> 16:32.501
Strong showing in round one,
Team Maroon.

16:32.535 --> 16:35.303
Or should I say Team Ma-Russo?

16:35.337 --> 16:36.904
[unintelligible]

16:38.406 --> 16:40.340
No, no, no. Please,
don't say Team Russo.

16:40.508 --> 16:43.842
Say Team Harper.
Come on, Harper! Harper! Harper!

16:43.877 --> 16:46.878
Are you kidding me? Would it hurt
you to play along? Really? Really?

16:48.614 --> 16:50.715
Ah, the sweet smell of modesty.

16:50.749 --> 16:53.284
Looks like this isn't your
first rodeo, buckaroo.

16:53.485 --> 16:58.187
You better be careful or you may wind up
with a brand new reputation around here.

16:58.221 --> 17:01.090
And we all know how
hard it is to do that.

17:02.425 --> 17:04.157
Harper, I know you're mad,
I'm sorry,

17:04.292 --> 17:06.127
I'll step back and
let you close it out.

17:06.161 --> 17:08.029
It's much better to be
known as the closer.

17:08.797 --> 17:11.763
Fine. But if I have to go another year
with the same reputation, it's all on you.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.569
That's it. Who else's
study cards are you using?

17:17.604 --> 17:20.472
You answered questions in there that,
that weren't even on mine.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.607
Since when did you become
such a smarty pants?

17:25.277 --> 17:28.012
Smarty Pants! You're totally
wearing Smarty Pants!

17:28.046 --> 17:30.547
I am not.

17:33.717 --> 17:35.851
- I'm telling Mr. Laritate.
- Wait. Wait!

17:35.886 --> 17:38.520
What are you going to tell him?
That I have magic pants?

17:38.554 --> 17:40.188
Yes, I am.

17:45.059 --> 17:47.027
- No, I'm not.
- No, you can't.

17:48.062 --> 17:52.998
[theme music]

17:54.234 --> 17:57.803
Hey, Maxy. How's homework going?

17:57.837 --> 17:59.871
- It's going.
- Enough jibber-jabber.

18:00.206 --> 18:02.907
Let's cut to it. Alfred's Mom
called me and he sang like a canary.

18:02.941 --> 18:05.842
Oh, man! I knew I shouldn't have
taught him that dirty canary song.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.810
[grunts]

18:07.845 --> 18:09.779
Why would you think you
could get away with

18:09.946 --> 18:11.914
selling fountain water
next to the fountain?

18:12.382 --> 18:16.084
I don't know. You buy bottled water
and there's a faucet right over there.

18:16.118 --> 18:19.854
Well, because bottled water
is cleaner and it's portable,

18:19.888 --> 18:22.422
You can take it somewhere and
drink it whenever you want.

18:22.623 --> 18:25.791
Oh. Sort of like those little puppies
that you can fit in your purse?

18:27.060 --> 18:29.726
No, nothing like that.

18:29.761 --> 18:33.129
But come on, they're pretty cute.

18:33.163 --> 18:36.765
Look, if you want to sell something
that people can otherwise get for free,

18:36.799 --> 18:40.003
you have to add something to
it so that it's more valuable.

18:40.037 --> 18:43.973
Valuable, I got it. Thanks, Mom.

18:44.008 --> 18:45.976
You're welcome, sweetie.

18:46.010 --> 18:48.378
Now, let's talk about
this dirty canary song.

18:48.412 --> 18:51.713
Good, because I need a second verse.
Let me go get my songbook.

19:00.255 --> 19:02.522
Thank you, Zeke. Here's your water

19:02.557 --> 19:04.557
and... Alfred!

19:04.592 --> 19:06.259
- [drums on box]
- [puppies whining]

19:06.294 --> 19:08.061
Here's your puppy.

19:09.997 --> 19:11.662
I don't think I want a puppy.

19:11.963 --> 19:14.630
I'm adding value. If you don't
take it, it's a rip-off.

19:18.434 --> 19:20.902
- Get your Puppy Water!
- Get your Puppy Water!

19:20.936 --> 19:23.538
- Get your Puppy Water.
- Water with a puppy!

19:25.374 --> 19:27.108
Question one. Algebra.

19:27.476 --> 19:30.477
What are the polar coordinates of the
point whose Cartesian coordinates are:

19:30.511 --> 19:31.745
Oh-three.

19:34.415 --> 19:35.581
Alex Russo.

19:35.615 --> 19:37.883
Of course, Alex Russo.

19:37.917 --> 19:40.185
Three pi over two.

19:40.219 --> 19:42.687
Yippee pi-ay-yay!

19:45.691 --> 19:47.592
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

19:47.626 --> 19:49.827
Save it. I knew I
couldn't trust you.

19:49.861 --> 19:52.028
All I wanted is to look
smart in front of everyone

19:52.062 --> 19:54.063
and then you,
of all people, show me up.

19:54.097 --> 19:56.765
[Laritate] What is a calorie?

19:56.799 --> 19:58.800
If you answer that, I quit.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.068
I won't answer it.

20:01.336 --> 20:02.836
The amount of energy needed

20:03.171 --> 20:05.739
to raise one cubic centimeter
of water one degree Celsius.

20:05.773 --> 20:06.906
[mouthing] I'm sorry.

20:06.941 --> 20:09.041
Correct!

20:10.710 --> 20:12.878
That's it. I quit.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.546
Wait, Harper...

20:14.580 --> 20:17.482
- No, no! Harper, wait.
- [Laritate] Finkel, Russo.

20:17.516 --> 20:20.885
This is a Quiz Bowl,
not a Drama Bowl.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.920
Let's bring it back into the barn.

20:22.954 --> 20:25.856
- OK. Next question...
- No, wait. Time out. Time out.

20:25.890 --> 20:27.791
Wait, can you call a
time out in a Quiz Bowl?

20:28.159 --> 20:30.427
Not according to the Quiz Bowl rules.
Ask the question!

20:30.461 --> 20:32.930
- She's away from the buzzer!
- I have something to say.

20:32.964 --> 20:37.131
With a 27 point lead,
I will allow the time out.

20:37.166 --> 20:41.401
The rest of this Quiz Bowl
is under protest! - Yeah!

20:44.004 --> 20:47.873
The only reason why I did this whole
Quiz Bowl thing was to help out a friend.

20:48.942 --> 20:51.543
I'm not going to
let my friend down.

20:51.577 --> 20:53.778
I'll do whatever it takes...

20:53.812 --> 20:56.180
... no matter how
embarrassing it is.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.816
Some of you may not want to look.

20:58.850 --> 21:03.420
Hey, Dean. She's taking her
pants off. Should we look?

21:04.388 --> 21:06.155
No.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.461
[both gasp]

21:13.963 --> 21:16.764
Alex! You kept the
pants on too long!

21:16.799 --> 21:19.433
- What?
- Skeleton legs!

21:21.001 --> 21:23.869
Was that on the list of side
effects that I didn't listen to?

21:25.771 --> 21:29.006
Well, when in doubt,
dance out, huh?

21:29.041 --> 21:31.608
- OK.
- [bones clacking]

21:33.878 --> 21:36.913
- [Alex] This is good.
- Come on!

21:48.167 --> 21:51.068
Thank you, Alex. After you left,
Nellie stepped back in.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.370
And I brought it home
in a real nail biter.

21:53.404 --> 21:56.706
Wow, so you won.
I never would have guessed.

21:58.208 --> 21:59.541
I owe you big time.

21:59.642 --> 22:01.543
And I was thinking,
a skeleton shirt

22:01.577 --> 22:03.578
to go with those skeleton tights.

22:03.612 --> 22:05.613
Yes! Skeleton tights.

22:05.647 --> 22:08.382
That's totally believable.
Spread that around. Please.

22:09.983 --> 22:12.719
Mom, how'd it go?
Am I in big trouble?

22:12.753 --> 22:15.155
It's weird. Your principal
started to talk about you,

22:15.189 --> 22:17.624
and then he got a phone call
about some dirty canary song

22:17.658 --> 22:20.059
sweeping through the seventh grade.

22:20.093 --> 22:21.793
Uh, Mom, I think Max was the...

22:21.827 --> 22:23.061
Shh. Let's get out of here.
