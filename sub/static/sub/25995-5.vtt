WEBVTT

00:00.049 --> 00:01.921
I want you right beside me,

00:01.962 --> 00:03.718
not because it's your job,

00:03.836 --> 00:05.046
but because it's our choice.

00:05.087 --> 00:07.447
This is a very,
very dangerous politician.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.460
Someone who must be stopped.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.532
We've taken the liberty of providing
you with a tablet,

00:15.572 --> 00:18.554
so the material can't be traced to
your own devices.

00:20.380 --> 00:24.420
Someone acquired clearance to
make a secret visit to her suite.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.580
I need to ask you to identify
yourself.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.900
He gave the name Richard Longcross.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.540
Security Service.

00:30.580 --> 00:31.780
I'm sure of it.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.020
That was us plotting to build
the Death Star.

00:34.060 --> 00:35.820
Julia's snatching the key
to Number 10.

00:35.860 --> 00:38.620
We need to do something. Fast.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.460
This never happened.

00:40.500 --> 00:43.460
And if I don't come back,
go to the Death Star.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.132
I thought they were
sending you a cab.

00:45.173 --> 00:47.373
Yeah. I don't need their shitty cab.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.660
Let's have some nice food,
a couple of drinks.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.860
This feels weird.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.156
What about Budd?

00:59.197 --> 01:02.023
He left the auditorium and when he
came back in that's when

01:02.320 --> 01:04.019
Mahmood appeared on the stage.

01:04.060 --> 01:06.180
Rob just called me.
I need to warn Julia.

01:06.220 --> 01:07.289
What's in the briefcase?

01:11.260 --> 01:14.300
From this angle, it's unclear if the
explosion originated from the briefcase.

01:15.890 --> 01:18.980
What's going on here, then,
Mr Macdonald?

01:19.020 --> 01:22.020
Whatever Tahir was doing,
I'm completely in the dark about it.

01:22.060 --> 01:25.634
There's a simple,
plausible story for you to stick to.

01:25.675 --> 01:27.601
And you will stick to it.

01:29.966 --> 01:33.492
Despite the heroic efforts
of our emergency services,

01:33.540 --> 01:36.386
the Home Secretary
Julia Montague

01:36.427 --> 01:39.513
succumbed to her injuries
and was pronounced dead.

01:39.740 --> 01:41.937
Dave, you've shot yourself.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.378
It was a blank round.

01:43.660 --> 01:45.571
Is there something you're not
revealing to us regarding the

01:45.611 --> 01:49.289
state of your mind before,
during, or after the attack?

01:49.541 --> 01:51.981
Nadia, we're desperate to find the
person who's been creating

01:52.031 --> 01:53.257
these devices.

01:54.780 --> 01:58.090
Two attacks on the Home
Secretary, Budd PPO for both...

01:58.131 --> 02:00.860
Mahmood's briefcase...
I don't trust him.

02:01.008 --> 02:02.664
He's hiding something.

02:09.494 --> 02:11.493
Sir. We heard back
from Fort Halstead.

02:11.534 --> 02:12.534
Thank you.

02:16.686 --> 02:18.366
Shit.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.140
The device wasn't in the briefcase.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.980
From the pattern of damage and the
expansion of the blast wave,

02:26.020 --> 02:27.980
it appears the bomb was planted
under the stage.

02:28.020 --> 02:30.820
Planted? It couldn't have
been, surely...

02:30.860 --> 02:32.660
We don't know how they got access.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.079
We're still checking security cameras
and interviewing college staff.

02:35.119 --> 02:36.360
The sniffer dogs, they would
have...?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.336
Materials that survived the
explosion suggest that the

02:38.376 --> 02:40.242
device was housed in an
airtight container.

02:40.574 --> 02:42.852
When the detonator was triggered,
it could've opened a valve to

02:42.892 --> 02:46.265
allow in oxygen to support
combustion of the TATP explosive.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.180
Was it triggered by a timer?

02:48.220 --> 02:51.218
Remnants of circuitry were
detected at the scene.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.500
Fort Halstead believe it could've
been a pressure sensor...

02:54.540 --> 02:57.380
...designed to trigger the device when
weight was applied to the stage.

02:57.420 --> 02:59.701
That's why Mahmood needed to
get backstage.

02:59.742 --> 03:02.020
The Home Secretary had avoided
activating the pressure sensor.

03:02.060 --> 03:04.180
Mahmood needed to get up there
and set it off.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.532
Although that would create the risk
of the device being triggered

03:06.572 --> 03:09.218
at the wrong time, by a person
venturing on to the stage

03:09.259 --> 03:10.313
before the Home Secretary's speech.

03:10.353 --> 03:12.524
Hence why we're also investigating
whether the pressure sensor

03:12.564 --> 03:15.204
or the device itself were
controlled by a timer, or...

03:15.614 --> 03:17.374
...if they were activated remotely.

03:18.851 --> 03:20.914
By another person, not Tahir?

03:21.740 --> 03:23.359
We're looking, Ma'am.

03:24.462 --> 03:26.187
I've got my suspicions.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.791 --> 03:46.491
You all right, Skipper?

03:46.929 --> 03:49.540
I need updates from all the
Home Secretary's PPOs and CPOs.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.060
Anything suspicious, anything out of
the ordinary.

03:54.179 --> 03:55.939
Something the matter, Tom?

03:56.750 --> 04:00.420
We lost Kim! Nobody's heard a word
off you about it.

04:03.664 --> 04:05.264
I'm sorry, mate, you're right.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.737
I've been in my own head.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.820
Let's talk about this
over a pint, eh?

04:16.019 --> 04:17.180
All right.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.148
David Budd.

04:46.189 --> 04:47.638
David...?

04:48.420 --> 04:50.700
It's Louise Rayburn.

04:51.179 --> 04:54.860
Look, I'm not permitted to reveal
details of the wider inquiries.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.562
This didn't come from me, OK?

05:02.140 --> 05:04.020
The bomb wasn't in the briefcase.

05:05.074 --> 05:06.954
It wasn't your fault.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.023
David?

05:12.780 --> 05:13.898
Thank you.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.980
Sorry to keep you waiting.

05:22.150 --> 05:23.461
Let's head round to the Red Lion.

05:23.501 --> 05:24.835
My shout.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.119
Sarge. I thought you'd
better see this.

06:00.140 --> 06:01.900
Go back.

06:10.940 --> 06:13.020
There's over an hour of
footage missing.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.020
- What? Is this on all of them?
- Yes.

06:20.540 --> 06:23.260
Right. Save this all to a drive
and get it up to the boss.

06:23.301 --> 06:24.301
OK.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.352
Your story about this guy
Longcross and the missing CCTV...

06:34.393 --> 06:35.182
Yeah.

06:35.261 --> 06:36.701
I believe you.

06:36.780 --> 06:39.340
The hair was blonde,
pushed back off the forehead.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.500
A bit more like that?

06:40.540 --> 06:41.580
Yeah.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.260
The eyes were darker. Yeah.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.180
- And that?
- Yeah, that's perfect.

06:48.220 --> 06:49.260
What about the nose?

06:49.300 --> 06:50.980
The nose was wider at the tip.

06:51.020 --> 06:53.620
- What about his jaw?
- His jaw was a bit squarer. A bit more.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.926
Hair? Is that right?

06:54.967 --> 06:56.567
His hair was shorter.

06:56.608 --> 06:58.693
Yeah. Eyes were maybe a little
narrower.

06:58.826 --> 07:00.196
- His forehead a little taller...
- Age OK?

07:00.236 --> 07:02.750
He's a bit older-looking than this.
Slightly narrower...

07:02.791 --> 07:04.290
How's that looking?

07:04.331 --> 07:06.331
Yeah, that's starting
to look like him.

07:27.340 --> 07:29.816
- Sarge?
- What you got?

07:38.460 --> 07:39.500
Brilliant.

07:46.557 --> 07:48.117
Cheers, mate.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.525
Finally. We've got your shooter.

07:59.930 --> 08:01.820
Sergeant Andrew Apsted.

08:01.860 --> 08:04.100
Served in Helmand Province,
two tours.

08:04.578 --> 08:05.980
And get this -

08:06.020 --> 08:07.620
he was EOD.

08:09.540 --> 08:12.234
This could be the original
bomb-maker or an accomplice

08:12.275 --> 08:13.315
of Longcross.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.429
Sorry...

08:20.300 --> 08:21.780
Brings it all back.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.335
It's... It's brilliant.

08:31.453 --> 08:33.210
Listen, David...

08:34.828 --> 08:37.099
With everything that's going on,

08:37.140 --> 08:40.474
maybe we've not paid enough attention
to the fact the shooter blew his

08:40.515 --> 08:42.405
brains out right in front of you.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.660
You lost your Principal
and one of your team.

08:51.106 --> 08:53.588
I think it'd be a good
idea if you stepped away

08:53.629 --> 08:57.090
from the inquiry and we get you some
time with the counsellor, yeah?

08:57.131 --> 08:59.131
No. No way.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.372
Figuring out who killed Julia,
that's all that matters.

09:02.412 --> 09:04.840
That's the only thing that's going
to make me feel OK again.

09:05.669 --> 09:07.605
I think it runs deeper than that.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.184
You just called her Julia.

09:11.248 --> 09:13.648
Sorry, Nadia, I don't know what's
keeping them...

09:13.940 --> 09:15.940
We're good to go.

09:26.856 --> 09:30.707
We've got some plausible locations
of the car park you described.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.605
I'm afraid we weren't able to see
your husband's car or any

09:33.646 --> 09:36.856
type of meeting in any of the
CCTV cameras relating to

09:36.897 --> 09:38.379
the car parks themselves.

09:38.860 --> 09:42.574
We've looked at adjacent locations
and produced some

09:42.615 --> 09:44.551
images of persons of interest.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.260
Just take your time with these,
Nadia.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.900
Do you recognise this man?

09:53.087 --> 09:55.426
The interviewee is shaking her head.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.900
What about him?

10:01.820 --> 10:03.700
The interviewee is shaking her head.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.500
The interviewee is shaking her head.

10:16.820 --> 10:19.140
The interviewee is shaking her head.

10:19.180 --> 10:20.332
Do you...

10:21.105 --> 10:23.505
...recognise this man at all?

10:31.271 --> 10:32.801
Take your time.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.566
Sorry.

10:49.301 --> 10:50.301
It's OK.

10:50.377 --> 10:52.577
Nadia, thank you.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.528
Well done, Nadia.

10:55.569 --> 10:56.799
That was great.

11:07.140 --> 11:08.620
What about this man?

11:08.660 --> 11:09.762
You can't do that.

11:09.803 --> 11:10.803
I am doing.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.987
This wasn't included in disclosure.

11:13.028 --> 11:14.828
Nadia, please look at the e-fit.

11:23.199 --> 11:25.180
Nadia? Please. Lives depend on this.

11:25.220 --> 11:26.777
Do you know this man?

11:35.238 --> 11:37.518
Is this the man your husband met?

11:37.824 --> 11:40.980
Nadia has already described the man
as being IC4/6.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.349
Were you too afraid to tell
the truth?

11:42.389 --> 11:44.082
Was the man actually white?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.371
Is this the man your husband met?

12:07.620 --> 12:09.220
Is this the man your husband met?

12:09.260 --> 12:12.780
Nadia has already described the man
as being IC4/6.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.153
Were you too afraid to tell
the truth?

12:14.193 --> 12:15.553
Was the man actually white?

12:16.509 --> 12:18.589
Is this the man your husband met?

12:24.255 --> 12:25.695
It's not evidential.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.110
You know the process for photo ID.

12:28.260 --> 12:30.044
And an e-fit's never going to
give a true likeness.

12:30.084 --> 12:31.146
There's every chance she's mistaken.

12:31.186 --> 12:33.736
Right now, though, boss, that's not
really the point, though, is it?

12:33.776 --> 12:35.976
As your DCI, Louise, I'd say
actually it is.

12:37.303 --> 12:38.614
You just going to sit on your hands?

12:38.654 --> 12:40.721
- David, leave this to us.
- No-one was following up on Longcross.

12:40.761 --> 12:41.684
I had to do that bit myself.

12:41.725 --> 12:43.114
We have got to consider
all of the possibilities.

12:43.154 --> 12:45.216
One of which is the Security Service
were involved in the

12:45.256 --> 12:47.567
- assassination of a Cabinet minister.
- We don't know that.

12:47.607 --> 12:49.880
That's what we need to find out!
Longcross is our lead.

12:49.921 --> 12:51.845
Well, from now on every
step we take's by the book.

12:51.885 --> 12:54.126
What's next then?
Going "by the book"?

12:54.278 --> 12:57.105
That's for me and
Commander Sampson to decide.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.860
He's only trying to help, boss.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.260
David!

13:10.660 --> 13:13.100
Look, Sharma's under a
lot of pressure.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.910
He values your contribution.
We all do.

13:14.951 --> 13:16.151
Sure.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.460
David.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.500
David, wait.

13:24.540 --> 13:27.300
I really want to talk to you
about your head wound.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.380
I told you,
I got it off a gas cooker.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.980
I think it's best if you're examined
by the Force Doctor.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.051
Get off my back, Louise.

13:33.092 --> 13:34.372
What am I supposed to do, David?

13:35.140 --> 13:36.396
Let you run around like
everything's rosy?

13:36.436 --> 13:37.637
Do you not get it?

13:38.809 --> 13:40.104
This is how they'll
discredit the inquiry.

13:40.144 --> 13:41.547
They'll make me out to be
a basket case.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.027
No-one in this building would use
that kind of language.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.270
You've got an illness, David.

13:47.246 --> 13:48.500
You're traumatized.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.220
That sounds any better?

13:50.260 --> 13:52.473
Why are you making this about me
when we just found out

13:52.514 --> 13:54.179
Longcross supplied the bomb?

13:54.220 --> 13:55.380
The Security Service.

13:55.420 --> 13:56.880
Finding out why,
that's the answer to all of this.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.692
David, you need help.

13:57.732 --> 13:59.332
I need to find who killed Julia.

14:03.180 --> 14:06.180
Julia Montague's funeral
took place earlier today.

14:06.220 --> 14:10.260
It was a private ceremony for
close family only.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.980
But in the House of Commons there
was a succession...

14:13.020 --> 14:16.100
An esteemed colleague who is a
great loss to her party,

14:16.140 --> 14:18.500
her country and this House.

14:18.540 --> 14:22.060
Those of us who knew Julia,
who worked with her,

14:22.100 --> 14:25.300
are still measuring
the scale of our loss.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.660
Julia and I grew up
together in this house.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.700
In the end, the pressures of work
made our marriage unsustainable.

14:32.740 --> 14:36.043
To this day I still look back and
remember our time together as

14:36.084 --> 14:37.480
the happiest days of...

15:20.924 --> 15:23.230
Thank you, Home Secretary.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.980
How much have you got?

15:27.020 --> 15:28.620
Enough.

15:29.543 --> 15:33.423
Decryption instructions
for viewing the material.

15:33.464 --> 15:36.704
We've taken the liberty of providing
you with a tablet, so the material

15:36.745 --> 15:38.825
can't be traced to your own devices.

15:38.866 --> 15:41.385
We'll take the tablet back when
you're finished.

15:41.426 --> 15:44.420
It contains a read-only file you'll
be able to view for a limited

15:44.460 --> 15:48.700
time period, before being locked out
and requiring new decryption.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.066
If that happens you should
get in touch.

15:51.107 --> 15:53.863
I'm authorized to make suitable
arrangements.

15:54.140 --> 15:57.387
See how I go. Is that the lot?

15:57.700 --> 15:58.788
For the time being.

15:59.618 --> 16:01.049
I'll leave it with you.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.801
Thank you.

18:45.940 --> 18:49.300
Anyway, cheers, we'll catch up on
this again later. Thanks.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.820
Commander Sampson's office, please.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.460
Chief Superintendent Craddock.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.220
David Budd's just come
into the office.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.233
OK.

19:42.780 --> 19:45.217
You have reached
National Vehicle Services.

19:45.258 --> 19:48.467
Please state your inquiry leaving
your full name and a contact

19:48.508 --> 19:50.668
telephone number after the tone.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.420
- David.
- Ma'am.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.860
No, no, no. It's OK.

19:56.303 --> 19:58.943
I've received a call from SO15.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.060
Apparently you're being a
pain in the arse.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.398
Ma'am, I have reason to
believe there is...

20:02.438 --> 20:03.530
Listen.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.580
We lost the Home Secretary.

20:07.196 --> 20:09.476
Let's go after the
bastards who did it.

20:10.975 --> 20:12.495
Thank you very much, Ma'am.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.094
You OK to head across town?

20:14.533 --> 20:15.733
Sure.

20:15.858 --> 20:17.620
I'll have a car sent to
the D Block door.

20:17.660 --> 20:18.980
See you down there.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.060
Ma'am.

20:31.453 --> 20:32.687
Tom.

20:39.294 --> 20:41.054
Come in.

20:41.422 --> 20:43.218
- Lorraine.
- Ma'am.

20:43.259 --> 20:44.862
- David.
- Ma'am.

20:44.903 --> 20:48.783
My team have briefed me on this
non-evidential photo ID made

20:48.824 --> 20:50.064
by Nadia Ali.

20:50.414 --> 20:52.454
This individual,
Richard Longcross...

20:52.859 --> 20:55.260
You're convinced he works for the...
The Security Service.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.695
Yes, Ma'am.

20:56.736 --> 20:58.000
There's no evidence of that.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.281
There wasn't.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.940
Last night I saw him at an
internet cafe.

21:01.980 --> 21:06.055
Using a vehicle whose registration
data is withheld from the PNC.

21:06.340 --> 21:09.180
It's just some bullshit phone number
to sucker you into setting

21:09.220 --> 21:10.780
off an electronic trip wire.

21:10.820 --> 21:13.540
As you've disclosed it,
we can smooth that over.

21:13.580 --> 21:16.140
The only way Longcross could've
gone to the cafe is if they're

21:16.180 --> 21:18.383
tracking keywords
in online activity.

21:18.424 --> 21:19.504
What keywords?

21:19.545 --> 21:22.025
Relating to kompromat the
Security Service supplied to the

21:22.066 --> 21:23.375
Home Secretary.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.015
What are you talking about?

21:26.056 --> 21:28.176
In her hotel room a few days
before she was killed,

21:28.217 --> 21:30.457
the Home Secretary received a
visit from Longcross.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.915
He supplied her with an encrypted
file of kompromat she

21:32.955 --> 21:34.765
subsequently shared with the
Prime Minister.

21:34.838 --> 21:36.638
And you kept this to yourself?

21:38.570 --> 21:40.690
David's on to something, Ma'am -

21:40.731 --> 21:42.828
maybe wouldn't hurt to
focus on that.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.720
Did you manage to get any copies
of the kompromat?

21:47.761 --> 21:49.121
That wasn't possible, Ma'am.

21:49.162 --> 21:50.493
I attempted to photograph the
material

21:50.533 --> 21:53.859
using my mobile phone,
but the device was equipped

21:53.900 --> 21:57.820
with an infrared sensor that shut it
down in proximity to digital devices.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.140
Have you got any details on
the scandal?

22:00.180 --> 22:03.060
A series of scandals,
all covered up.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.094
A sexual assault. Drug addiction.

22:05.135 --> 22:06.726
Financial impropriety.

22:07.472 --> 22:10.552
Last night I learned they relate to
the Prime Minister.

22:13.492 --> 22:15.412
That's only what I was able
to deduce.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.108
There may be more kompromat.

22:17.180 --> 22:19.980
And now the Home Secretary's dead,
the Security Service must be

22:20.020 --> 22:21.700
terrified of their role coming out.

22:21.740 --> 22:25.540
That's why Longcross is tracking
keywords relating to the

22:25.580 --> 22:28.300
kompromat - to intercept anyone
who's on to them.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.500
So where's the kompromat now,
David, any idea?

22:30.540 --> 22:32.336
The Home Secretary had it with her.

22:32.377 --> 22:34.359
I assume it was destroyed in
the explosion.

22:34.434 --> 22:37.290
And you suspect the
Security Service planted the bomb?

22:37.331 --> 22:40.685
It makes no sense the security
service murdered Julia Montague.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.700
They were in partnership -
she offered them greater powers

22:43.740 --> 22:45.640
in return for the
compromising material.

22:45.681 --> 22:48.717
Maybe the relationship went sour,
or she became a liability,

22:48.758 --> 22:50.380
I don't know.

22:50.576 --> 22:52.696
Cui Bono. Who benefits?

22:54.340 --> 22:56.380
Clearly the Prime Minister, for one.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.060
And his supporters.
Roger Penhaligon. Mike Travis.

23:00.919 --> 23:02.479
Mike Travis?

23:02.621 --> 23:05.501
He was always jealous of the
Home Secretary's private meetings

23:05.542 --> 23:06.782
with the Security Service.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.500
And he's all about party unity
and completely loyal to the

23:09.540 --> 23:10.860
Prime Minister and Penhaligon.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.344
That's interesting.

23:12.540 --> 23:15.140
We know Tahir Mahmood wasn't
carrying the bomb in the briefcase.

23:15.180 --> 23:18.300
But he did set off the device via
a pressure sensor.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.660
And Rob Macdonald probably induced
him to go on the stage.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.265
And who's Rob's new boss at
the Home Office?

23:25.485 --> 23:27.851
- Mike Travis.
- Yes.

23:28.648 --> 23:29.768
Thank you, David.

23:29.812 --> 23:31.380
What's going to happen now, Ma'am?

23:31.420 --> 23:32.406
We'll see to it.

23:32.447 --> 23:33.422
People keep saying that.

23:33.463 --> 23:36.383
Meanwhile, the Home Secretary's
killers are no nearer being caught.

23:55.009 --> 23:56.529
Sorry to keep you, Sergeant.

23:56.570 --> 23:57.820
How can I be of assistance?

23:57.860 --> 23:59.898
Just a quiet word.

24:02.620 --> 24:04.940
The night the Home Secretary
was in surgery, she had three

24:04.980 --> 24:07.900
official visitors - Roger Penhaligon,
Mike Travis and Rob Macdonald.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.140
That's correct.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.618
What were their movements
that night?

24:10.658 --> 24:12.430
They were briefed in the
Management Suite,

24:12.471 --> 24:15.367
then Mr Penhaligon spent the night
awaiting news on his wife.

24:15.569 --> 24:16.609
Ex-wife.

24:16.727 --> 24:19.812
So he was alone?
Did he have any visitors?

24:19.999 --> 24:21.531
What about...

24:21.740 --> 24:22.780
...this man?

24:23.940 --> 24:25.780
Or him?

24:28.122 --> 24:29.282
Sorry.

24:29.438 --> 24:32.459
Did Mr Penhaligon hinder
the medical staff in any way?

24:32.500 --> 24:35.460
No, he was very concerned about
his wife's welfare.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.540
Ex-wife.

24:36.580 --> 24:39.580
Was there anything unusual he was
concerned about?

24:39.620 --> 24:42.500
He seemed very concerned about
the Home Secretary's personal

24:42.540 --> 24:44.633
items, but I suppose
that's not unusual.

24:44.674 --> 24:47.623
- What items?
- Her ministerial folder.

24:47.664 --> 24:49.568
Her briefcase. Her handbag.

24:49.609 --> 24:50.607
He took these?

24:50.648 --> 24:51.820
No, they were never found,

24:51.860 --> 24:54.260
which is why Mr Penhaligon
got very anxious.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.860
But that's because they're of
sentimental value.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.820
Thank you.

25:17.828 --> 25:20.287
- David Budd.
- What can we do for you, Sarge?

25:20.328 --> 25:21.820
I just want a couple of
minutes with your P.

25:21.860 --> 25:23.655
Do you mind skipping me to the
front of this queue?

25:23.695 --> 25:24.695
- Yeah.
- OK.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.273
This way.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.043
Sorry.

25:27.163 --> 25:29.211
Mr Penhaligon won't be a minute.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.660
You're interrupting my service
to my constituents.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.020
And I want you to leave.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.094
Don't make a scene in front of
all these people.

25:37.135 --> 25:39.295
Be all over social media
before the hour's up.

25:46.526 --> 25:48.376
I'd like to put to you new
information regarding the

25:48.416 --> 25:50.296
murder of your ex-wife.

25:51.260 --> 25:52.700
What new information?

25:52.740 --> 25:55.980
I'm interested in an item that was
in her possession before she died.

25:57.124 --> 25:58.461
What item?

26:00.340 --> 26:02.641
I've been informed you were anxious
to locate the Home Secretary's

26:02.681 --> 26:04.281
belongings on the night of
the attack.

26:04.489 --> 26:06.828
Well, she was in possession of
material that affected

26:06.869 --> 26:08.726
national security.

26:08.992 --> 26:10.832
I've been at the hospital.

26:11.060 --> 26:14.300
They told me you were interested in
items of sentimental value.

26:15.860 --> 26:17.634
The Home Secretary's life's hanging
by a thread and the

26:17.674 --> 26:20.274
Government's Chief Whip's hung up on
tracking down her handbag?

26:20.586 --> 26:22.146
You're being offensive, Sergeant.

26:22.412 --> 26:25.474
Now, I suggest you stop this line
of questioning now and I'll take up

26:25.515 --> 26:27.336
my complaint with your
senior officer.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.337
The item you were looking for,

26:29.671 --> 26:32.288
you knew it wouldn't be in her
official materials.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.781
What exactly was it you wanted to
get your hands on?

26:34.822 --> 26:37.782
I've nothing further to add without
my solicitor present.

26:41.571 --> 26:44.251
If you had a hand in her death,
you'll have me to answer to.

26:47.620 --> 26:50.060
If you'd just give me a minute.

26:57.820 --> 27:01.178
You're up to speed with the
briefing we've received from

27:01.219 --> 27:02.219
Commander Sampson?

27:02.267 --> 27:03.002
I am.

27:03.043 --> 27:06.162
I want to raise a specific
point of extreme sensitivity.

27:06.948 --> 27:10.398
- OK.
- Amit. Thanks.

27:10.914 --> 27:11.914
Er...

27:12.487 --> 27:18.302
This individual, who gave his name
as Richard Longcross,

27:18.343 --> 27:21.539
was seen at the Blackwood Hotel
by Julia's PPO, yet surveillance

27:21.580 --> 27:23.300
footage was removed.

27:24.401 --> 27:27.641
An allegation's been made that he's
one of your officers.

27:29.392 --> 27:30.952
Is he?

27:37.054 --> 27:38.219
No.

27:39.144 --> 27:41.640
I can see only one acceptable
way to prove he isn't.

27:42.742 --> 27:43.820
And that would be?

27:43.861 --> 27:47.261
Open yourselves up to the police
investigation. Give SO15 access.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.700
As you're aware,

27:51.453 --> 27:55.344
we're conducting dozens of
highly sensitive operations,

27:56.086 --> 27:59.687
all of which could be jeopardised if
sensitive information is disclosed.

28:00.300 --> 28:03.779
Hundreds of operatives in the field,
all of whom would be imperilled.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.019
You're not above the law.

28:05.567 --> 28:08.578
The matter isn't of law,
but of national security.

28:09.893 --> 28:13.398
The Thornton Circus gunman could
only have known your predecessor's

28:13.439 --> 28:14.879
itinerary via a police leak.

28:15.639 --> 28:17.319
A police leak could only have been

28:17.369 --> 28:21.633
behind the Heath Bank attack on the
children of your predecessor's PPO.

28:22.453 --> 28:24.920
There's no way I'm giving the
Metropolitan Police access to

28:24.961 --> 28:26.508
my organisation or my personnel.

28:26.549 --> 28:28.629
It's not your decision.
You answer to me.

28:28.670 --> 28:30.710
We all answer to someone.

28:47.913 --> 28:49.031
Stay down here, Grace.

28:49.072 --> 28:50.592
Grab yourself a coffee.

29:06.860 --> 29:08.380
Thank you.

29:10.101 --> 29:11.586
Yeah... drink?

29:11.900 --> 29:15.380
David Budd ambushed me at my
constituency surgery.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.160
David Budd?

29:16.201 --> 29:18.380
I'm convinced he's aware
of the kompromat.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.547
How?

29:19.588 --> 29:21.108
How the hell should I know?

29:21.812 --> 29:23.609
All we've got is what
the PM's told us.

29:23.650 --> 29:26.250
Not the whole story, either,
knowing how he rolls.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.461
Julia blackmailed him over
its content.

29:28.502 --> 29:31.547
Possibly she took Budd
into her confidence, or...

29:31.951 --> 29:33.834
he joined the dots.

29:48.781 --> 29:50.491
Mr Macdonald.

29:51.337 --> 29:52.398
PS Budd.

29:52.648 --> 29:56.750
Hi. Sorry, I've got to get to work.

29:57.344 --> 29:59.180
There's the people that
start the war,

29:59.220 --> 30:01.095
and the poor bastards that end up
in the line of fire.

30:01.135 --> 30:03.375
I'm sure you realise
the net's closing.

30:03.620 --> 30:05.220
Look, I haven't a clue... Really.

30:05.260 --> 30:06.860
I've got to get to work.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.820
I've looked into the eyes of a
suicide bomber.

30:09.860 --> 30:11.100
Tahir Mahmood,

30:11.570 --> 30:14.380
he was just some flunky terrified
of fucking up his boss' speech.

30:14.420 --> 30:17.820
But you... You made a point of not
being there that day.

30:17.860 --> 30:20.365
Then you called Tahir and made
him go up on stage.

30:20.406 --> 30:23.148
That all seems like a calculated
sequence of events to me.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.029
Did you come up with it
all on your own?

30:25.820 --> 30:28.818
Look, I've... I've been through
everything with SO15.

30:28.859 --> 30:29.383
No, no, no.

30:29.424 --> 30:31.100
You lied about everything to SO15.

30:31.140 --> 30:33.100
It's time to start telling
the truth.

30:34.461 --> 30:35.726
Are you threatening me?

30:37.780 --> 30:40.300
Julia was murdered in cold blood
and I know you were part of it.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.351
I had nothing to do...

30:41.392 --> 30:43.272
Tell SO15 what you know.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.445
SO15, do it.

30:45.486 --> 30:48.606
It would be redundant for me to say
"I know where you live".

30:52.967 --> 30:54.883
Boss. You'll never guess who's just
waltzed in

30:54.924 --> 30:56.353
to make a voluntary statement.

30:57.380 --> 31:00.100
I need to provide some background.

31:02.207 --> 31:07.359
Till recently, I, Mike Travis,
senior civil servants...

31:08.540 --> 31:11.740
Julia Montague involved us all in
Home Office business.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.940
Standard practice.

31:12.980 --> 31:16.900
Then there began to be these
frequent unofficial meetings

31:16.940 --> 31:19.460
with the Director General
of the Security Service

31:19.500 --> 31:23.460
and to an increasing degree we were
all shut out.

31:24.980 --> 31:27.700
It's still unclear to me
the nature of their meetings.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.060
OK.

31:29.100 --> 31:33.805
Then we came to suspect that Julia
was preparing a leadership bid.

31:33.846 --> 31:35.141
Who's "we"?

31:35.182 --> 31:36.860
Umm... Mike Travis.

31:36.900 --> 31:38.547
Roger Penhaligon.

31:38.588 --> 31:42.242
Mike Travis, formerly Minister of
State for Counter Terrorism,

31:42.283 --> 31:43.656
now Acting Home Secretary.

31:43.700 --> 31:46.700
Roger Penhaligon,
Government Chief Whip. Thank you.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.540
When Julia decided to go ahead
with her speech at

31:50.580 --> 31:53.540
St Matthew's College,
despite security advice,

31:53.580 --> 31:56.234
we realised we had to act fast.

31:56.460 --> 31:58.594
Act? In what way?

31:58.635 --> 32:02.259
To prevent her from starting a
potentially damaging

32:02.300 --> 32:03.700
leadership contest.

32:04.657 --> 32:07.828
I was told we needed to embarrass
Julia politically.

32:07.869 --> 32:09.094
Told by who?

32:09.135 --> 32:11.775
That came from Roger Penhaligon.

32:12.969 --> 32:17.803
I'm telling the whole truth when I
say that my only intention

32:17.844 --> 32:19.220
was to embarrass Julia.

32:19.260 --> 32:21.980
No way would I want to see her
harmed in any way.

32:22.176 --> 32:23.719
So what did you do?

32:24.148 --> 32:27.340
I inserted inaccurate material
in her speech...

32:29.300 --> 32:31.980
...with the idea being that she'd
immediately become embroiled

32:32.020 --> 32:34.620
in a humiliating climb-down.

32:35.900 --> 32:39.328
To make sure the plot couldn't be
retraced to me, and hence to

32:39.369 --> 32:44.187
Mike and Roger, I made an excuse not
to attend the speech and advised

32:44.228 --> 32:48.828
Julia that all the fact-checking
would be handled by Tahir Mahmood.

32:49.980 --> 32:54.281
We had this idea to use Tahir to
create an embarrassing moment

32:54.328 --> 32:58.365
on camera, something that would go
viral and immediately derail

32:58.406 --> 33:00.060
her campaign before it even
got started.

33:00.100 --> 33:03.203
This was the phone call to Mahmood
suggesting he go on stage and

33:03.244 --> 33:05.119
interrupt the Home
Secretary's speech?

33:05.160 --> 33:05.789
Yes.

33:06.001 --> 33:08.961
But it has been established that
Tahir Mahmood venturing onto

33:09.002 --> 33:10.842
the stage could have
triggered the device.

33:11.437 --> 33:14.570
Yes, but none of us... None of us
knew anything about the bomb.

33:14.611 --> 33:15.625
I mean...

33:15.821 --> 33:17.299
I certainly didn't.

33:17.340 --> 33:19.180
It was all about the politics.

33:19.220 --> 33:21.980
Why'd you make a point of giving
Mahmood the briefcase?

33:22.020 --> 33:25.500
I didn't want him examining the
documents till it was too late.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.531
So I handed him a closed briefcase
at the very last minute,

33:28.572 --> 33:32.580
reassuring him that the contents
didn't need to be reviewed.

33:32.620 --> 33:35.594
Firstly, the briefcase has been
shown not to have contained

33:35.635 --> 33:36.945
an improvised explosive device.

33:36.986 --> 33:40.398
And secondly, all your forensic
investigations have found no

33:40.439 --> 33:43.239
explosive residue on my client,
at his home or place of work.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.720
Let's be clear, Mr Macdonald, OK.

33:45.761 --> 33:48.361
Was everyone involved in this
plot to embarrass the

33:48.402 --> 33:52.165
Home Secretary unaware Tahir Mahmood
might set off a bomb at the venue?

33:52.206 --> 33:53.646
Of course.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.516
We're politicians.

33:55.557 --> 33:57.357
We're not murderers.

33:57.780 --> 34:00.940
You worked closely with
Julia Montague, didn't you?

34:00.980 --> 34:02.172
Yes.

34:02.382 --> 34:04.622
Yet you were prepared to stab
her in the back?

34:07.196 --> 34:08.914
No... It wasn't like that.

34:11.455 --> 34:16.094
It was... It was all for the sake
of party unity.

34:20.223 --> 34:22.342
So he didn't give us anything
on the kompromat.

34:22.384 --> 34:24.424
I doubt he was ever in the loop.

34:24.465 --> 34:27.389
Roger and Mike played the party
unity card, Rob rolled over.

34:27.429 --> 34:29.089
It didn't seem like he
believed it himself.

34:29.129 --> 34:30.762
He didn't. He had
his own reason.

34:31.007 --> 34:32.273
What?

34:33.219 --> 34:35.620
I witnessed the Home Secretary
reject Rob's advances a

34:35.659 --> 34:36.860
couple of times.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.139
Humiliated him.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.219
He wanted to do the same to her.

34:41.407 --> 34:43.527
I think he's telling the truth.

34:54.599 --> 34:56.518
Budd's wife's been at work all day.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.312
She's just returning now.

35:07.698 --> 35:10.922
Unfortunately RPOs guard the safe
house round the clock.

35:16.112 --> 35:18.432
Then we're forced to be bold.

35:21.472 --> 35:22.512
Ops.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.516
Boss is back.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.140
He's on his way.

35:39.169 --> 35:41.049
How'd it go at the Home Office?

35:41.727 --> 35:44.300
Fortunately while the kompromat's
still out there, there isn't

35:44.340 --> 35:47.567
a politician in Westminster not
shitting himself he's implicated.

35:47.608 --> 35:49.586
Makes it easier to push back.

35:49.865 --> 35:51.065
Good.

35:51.300 --> 35:53.531
Only problem is they know about you.

35:53.572 --> 35:55.612
"Longcross."

35:56.020 --> 35:58.380
That'll be David Budd.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.140
He's the only one who challenged me.

36:00.180 --> 36:01.980
The only one I gave that name to.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.980
Some fucking bullet-stopper.

36:04.746 --> 36:08.366
How could you let him get
one over on you?

36:08.785 --> 36:09.825
No.

36:13.927 --> 36:15.887
It's the other way round.

36:16.856 --> 36:17.873
- David.
- Ma'am.

36:17.914 --> 36:18.914
Come in.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.900
Thanks for coming in
at short notice.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.300
Have a seat.

36:26.481 --> 36:29.390
Unfortunately, this was something
that really couldn't wait.

36:30.270 --> 36:31.312
Erm...

36:31.353 --> 36:34.516
I've received an extremely serious
allegation regarding

36:34.557 --> 36:37.997
unprofessional intimacy between you
and the late Home Secretary.

36:40.582 --> 36:42.641
Who's making this allegation?

36:43.039 --> 36:44.879
I'm not at liberty to say.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.960
They're alleging something
went on in private.

36:47.367 --> 36:48.953
I can't see how there's any
evidence.

36:48.994 --> 36:50.745
In which case, you can't give any
credence to this allegation.

36:50.785 --> 36:51.900
There's a recording.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.980
This is coming from
the Security Service?

36:58.180 --> 36:59.980
Longcross must've bugged her room.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.660
Is this recording even legal?

37:01.700 --> 37:03.140
David, is it true?

37:05.805 --> 37:08.140
Ma'am, you know you have to caution
me if there's any possibility

37:08.180 --> 37:09.805
my answer might incriminate me.

37:09.846 --> 37:12.009
I'm entitled to a consultation with
my Police Federation Representative.

37:12.049 --> 37:13.259
Don't quote the
Regs at me, David.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.813
You weren't just fucking
the Home Secretary.

37:14.853 --> 37:16.461
You're fucking our whole reputation.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.406
They're to discredit me, Ma'am!

37:18.447 --> 37:19.681
I'm onto them.

37:19.722 --> 37:21.640
The Security Service,
Longcross, all of them!

37:21.681 --> 37:22.554
All of who?

37:22.595 --> 37:23.956
There's been leaks
right the way through

37:23.996 --> 37:27.016
this whole investigation, Ma'am.
The Home Secretary's itinerary.

37:27.057 --> 37:29.503
My kids' school.
The bomb planted at St Matthew's.

37:29.544 --> 37:32.144
The Security Service could
have done it all.

37:36.334 --> 37:38.054
David, you've been through a lot.

37:40.201 --> 37:41.481
Take time off.

37:41.522 --> 37:43.086
Stop ruffling feathers.

37:43.127 --> 37:46.327
Then maybe, just maybe,
I can make this go away.

37:47.163 --> 37:49.422
They want me to go away.

38:07.437 --> 38:08.413
Dave.

38:08.454 --> 38:11.380
Sorry, Vic, I wanted to
talk away from the kids.

38:11.562 --> 38:12.562
What's up?

38:12.937 --> 38:13.980
There's something
going on at work.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.196
I don't know if it's going to come
out or not, but you've got a

38:16.236 --> 38:17.324
right to know.

38:17.549 --> 38:19.308
As my wife, I mean.

38:19.540 --> 38:20.980
OK.

38:22.632 --> 38:23.672
Julia and I...

38:25.124 --> 38:26.711
...we were having an affair.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.060
What do you want me to say?

38:32.340 --> 38:35.500
I don't "want" you to say anything.

38:38.140 --> 38:40.740
Look, I've got to get to hand-over,
so...

38:43.020 --> 38:44.780
By the way, you're a day late.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.483
Come again?

38:47.383 --> 38:50.700
Yesterday, a security officer
came up to the ward.

38:51.028 --> 38:53.896
He said that you and the
Home Secretary were "very close".

38:53.937 --> 38:55.260
What security officer?

38:55.300 --> 38:57.780
He said he was looking into the
circumstances surrounding the

38:57.820 --> 38:58.844
Home Secretary's death.

38:58.885 --> 39:00.789
What the hell's a
"security officer"?

39:00.830 --> 39:02.710
Was this bloke police or what?

39:02.779 --> 39:03.779
I'm not sure.

39:03.820 --> 39:05.899
Was he plainclothes? A detective?

39:05.940 --> 39:07.340
Did he give a name?

39:07.380 --> 39:09.140
Erm, not that I remember.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.780
For God's sake, Vic! What were you
thinking, not getting a name?

39:11.820 --> 39:14.048
I couldn't help him and then he left
without making a big deal out of it.

39:14.088 --> 39:16.086
All right, he'll be on CCTV.

39:16.172 --> 39:16.805
Umm...

39:16.845 --> 39:19.725
Ward D-20, 2:00, 2:30...

39:21.300 --> 39:23.620
What did he say exactly?

39:24.574 --> 39:28.023
Stuff about when you were coming
home after your shifts.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.460
If you'd ever brought anything back
to put somewhere safe,

39:31.500 --> 39:35.220
if you'd ever brought anything back
belonging to the Home Secretary.

39:35.260 --> 39:37.780
He even asked if the
Home Secretary had ever visited.

39:44.959 --> 39:46.374
That him?

39:47.100 --> 39:48.273
Yes.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.740
Look, Vicky, thanks.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.060
I need to get on with things,
before it's too late.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.620
Well, who is he,
what is this all about?

39:56.660 --> 39:58.580
The less you know, the better.

39:58.620 --> 39:59.740
Are we in any danger?

39:59.780 --> 40:01.954
No, look, you're in a safe house,
with round-the-clock protection.

40:01.994 --> 40:02.798
You'll be fine.

40:02.839 --> 40:05.712
Then why did you say
"before it's too late"?

40:05.753 --> 40:06.753
No reason.

40:20.140 --> 40:23.020
The device planted at
St Matthew's College.

40:23.060 --> 40:26.140
We've got gaps in the CCTV from
the night before.

40:26.180 --> 40:28.980
How that happened, and how the
offenders bypassed security,

40:29.020 --> 40:30.658
we still don't know.

40:30.940 --> 40:33.955
Same goes for how the bomb wasn't
detected, despite searches of

40:33.996 --> 40:36.636
the venue right up to a few minutes
before the attack.

40:37.322 --> 40:38.482
Andrew Apsted.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.500
We need more on him.

40:40.540 --> 40:45.101
Who he grew up with, who he joined
the Army with, who he served with.

40:45.142 --> 40:46.742
And where did he get that rifle?

40:49.143 --> 40:50.158
Erm...

40:50.199 --> 40:52.807
Guys, OK if we pick this up later?

40:52.997 --> 40:54.117
- No worries.
- No probs.

40:59.077 --> 41:00.917
He wasn't just at the internet cafe.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.740
He visited my wife's ward.

41:03.217 --> 41:04.897
My God.

41:06.503 --> 41:07.938
Cheers, we'll...

41:08.666 --> 41:10.550
We'll look into it.

41:11.140 --> 41:11.658
Look.

41:11.699 --> 41:15.299
Unfortunately there wasn't any CCTV
at the internet cafe, but...

41:15.371 --> 41:17.771
I'm guessing that's why you went there
in the first place.

41:19.091 --> 41:21.651
We're still checking other
cameras in the vicinity.

41:21.692 --> 41:24.092
I overheard you talking about
Thornton Circus.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.814
We've learned Apsted formed
a pressure group called

41:26.855 --> 41:28.335
Veterans' Peace Group.

41:28.555 --> 41:30.140
So he was on a watch list?

41:30.181 --> 41:31.181
No.

41:31.420 --> 41:34.275
The group was marginal,
never threatened any action. But...

41:34.595 --> 41:37.660
you're right,
it's weird he wasn't.

41:38.424 --> 41:41.304
Which brings us back to your
Security Service theory.

41:41.345 --> 41:43.460
Maybe they didn't put him on a watch
list cos they wanted to keep

41:43.500 --> 41:44.814
him under the radar.

41:45.060 --> 41:46.408
He was recruited by them?

41:46.449 --> 41:48.929
A disaffected loner with
explosives experience?

41:49.525 --> 41:52.005
Talk about perfect candidate.

41:53.980 --> 41:55.500
I know how stretched you are here.

41:55.540 --> 41:56.619
Let me look into this.

41:56.660 --> 42:00.100
We've already had a conversation
about how fit you are to work.

42:07.100 --> 42:10.780
The moment this case is over,
I'll see the counsellor,

42:10.820 --> 42:12.140
I'll see the doc, whatever.

42:12.180 --> 42:13.799
I just need time.

42:15.094 --> 42:18.330
Please, I'm asking you as a
colleague, copper to copper.

42:22.500 --> 42:23.740
Thanks, Louise.

43:16.829 --> 43:18.229
Blast from the past.

43:18.340 --> 43:20.420
Took a few calls to get
your new number.

43:20.460 --> 43:21.660
I'm here.

43:23.260 --> 43:24.300
So what have you got?

43:30.140 --> 43:31.620
A Makarov.

43:31.947 --> 43:33.420
Nice bit of kit.

43:33.709 --> 43:35.629
I can get you six more.

43:36.712 --> 43:37.712
How much?

43:37.956 --> 43:39.831
Not how much. What.

43:39.941 --> 43:42.861
A PSL, with no history
traceable back to me.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.494
Fine. I'll take my business
elsewhere.

43:48.535 --> 43:51.055
Maybe I can make a couple of calls.

43:55.980 --> 43:57.564
But this...

43:58.060 --> 43:59.820
This is going to take work.

44:08.300 --> 44:10.300
I'm not making no promises.

44:10.340 --> 44:12.329
I get that back when
we do the trade.

44:12.370 --> 44:14.330
Or I'll come looking.

44:25.100 --> 44:26.940
Not answering your phone?

44:30.540 --> 44:31.580
Sorry, I must've...

44:33.486 --> 44:34.252
Battery's dead.

44:34.293 --> 44:36.550
You want to get a refund, the amount
of time that thing's switched off.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.970
It's late, Louise. Is there
something I can help you with?

44:39.011 --> 44:41.331
CCTV from your wife's ward
was deleted.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.740
Same as the Blackwood
and St Matthew's.

44:43.780 --> 44:45.479
And none of the cameras in the
vicinity of the internet cafe

44:45.519 --> 44:46.919
picked up anything either.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.233
They know how to avoid 'em.

44:49.859 --> 44:52.139
I do have something, though.

44:54.860 --> 44:57.060
Security camera at your
wife's safe house.

44:58.220 --> 45:01.197
They identified themselves
as SO15 Officers.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.992
By the time the RPO alerted anyone
of her suspicions,

45:04.033 --> 45:05.420
they'd carried out a search.

45:05.460 --> 45:06.439
Security Service.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.080
Now, obviously, this means the
Safe House has been compromised

45:09.121 --> 45:11.841
but there is nothing to suggest that
your family are in danger.

45:11.882 --> 45:13.443
Remember when I told
you someone broke into my flat?

45:13.483 --> 45:15.202
- Do you believe me now?
- Yeah.

45:15.853 --> 45:18.140
It looks like they're convinced
the kompromat wasn't with the

45:18.180 --> 45:20.494
Home Secretary at the time of
the explosion.

45:21.601 --> 45:23.161
It's still out there.

45:23.980 --> 45:26.799
They seem pretty sure if anyone
knows where it's hidden, you do.

45:27.133 --> 45:28.773
Why's that, David?

45:29.009 --> 45:30.420
I don't know.

45:30.705 --> 45:32.822
Julia Montague's home was
thoroughly searched.

45:32.863 --> 45:34.303
All of her devices seized.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.460
There's no tablet found.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.900
I'm sorry I can't help you, Louise,

45:37.940 --> 45:39.331
but I don't know what
happened to it.

45:39.371 --> 45:42.171
Well, the Security Service believe
you know where it's hidden, So do I.

45:43.351 --> 45:45.471
I'll see you at
Julia Montague's flat.

45:45.580 --> 45:46.845
0800 tomorrow.

46:02.587 --> 46:03.884
Cheers.

46:11.780 --> 46:13.080
Apart from the seized devices,

46:13.121 --> 46:15.241
the search team left everything
where they found it.

46:16.049 --> 46:17.980
You know the layout better
than anyone.

46:18.020 --> 46:20.744
Maybe you'll spot something
that stands out.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.416
If you really think this will help.

46:40.020 --> 46:42.009
She had a computer in here.

46:42.050 --> 46:44.970
We've gone through the hard drive
with a fine-tooth comb.

47:56.540 --> 47:58.180
Tom, you're driving me up the wall.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.260
Shit or get off the pot, mate.

48:00.870 --> 48:02.390
Sorry, Ma'am.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.540
Come in.

48:09.250 --> 48:11.033
Now, what's up?

48:13.371 --> 48:16.331
I'm the last person
to dob in a skipper, Ma'am.

48:17.197 --> 48:18.197
But...

48:18.994 --> 48:19.994
David Budd...

48:21.713 --> 48:23.368
he's got this head
wound and everyone's

48:23.409 --> 48:25.769
letting him walk around
like nothing happened.

48:27.093 --> 48:28.773
Sit down.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.056
David?

48:42.576 --> 48:44.826
- Chanel.
- Hey.

48:44.867 --> 48:46.036
Hi.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.420
Is something wrong?

48:49.359 --> 48:51.439
Oh, my, God, of course there is.

48:51.652 --> 48:54.939
I was never Julia's biggest fan,
but I was genuinely so sorry

48:54.980 --> 48:57.117
to hear what happened.

48:57.158 --> 48:59.438
God, you must still be in shock.

48:59.660 --> 49:01.420
I'm all right.

49:01.924 --> 49:03.140
Maybe I shouldn't have come over.

49:03.180 --> 49:04.980
No, no, it's... I'm sorry, uh...

49:05.862 --> 49:07.470
Is this a regular haunt of yours?

49:07.541 --> 49:08.500
Oh...

49:08.540 --> 49:10.740
Always the policeman -
never off duty.

49:10.780 --> 49:13.580
Yes, I've been here before.
No, I'm not stalking you.

49:13.620 --> 49:14.660
Sorry.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.320
How are you doing?

49:17.587 --> 49:19.267
Yeah, all right.

49:19.486 --> 49:20.658
Moved on.

49:20.699 --> 49:23.739
I'm still looking for the right
opportunity. But, um...

49:24.362 --> 49:25.140
yeah...

49:25.180 --> 49:26.408
It's a tricky time.

49:26.449 --> 49:27.489
So...

49:31.806 --> 49:34.984
Actually I wanted to say I am
really sorry

49:35.025 --> 49:37.791
for causing such
a scene when I was fired.

49:40.908 --> 49:42.380
That was the last thing you needed.

49:42.420 --> 49:44.540
But thank you for being such a
sweetheart that day.

49:44.580 --> 49:46.275
You're very welcome.

49:46.799 --> 49:50.460
I wanted to thank you properly,
but your phone was out of service.

49:50.835 --> 49:53.267
I had to get a new one.

49:54.328 --> 49:58.608
Just cos I was going to suggest
a drink... if... My treat?

50:00.620 --> 50:01.545
Sure.

50:01.586 --> 50:03.620
- Yeah?
- Yes.

50:03.940 --> 50:04.940
OK.

50:05.088 --> 50:06.088
Umm...

50:06.460 --> 50:08.980
07700...

50:09.371 --> 50:12.299
- Yep.
- ..900431.

50:15.615 --> 50:16.695
And that's mine.

50:16.999 --> 50:18.839
Chai tea latte for Sam!

50:18.880 --> 50:20.720
- Oh, that's me.
- Sam?

50:20.940 --> 50:24.150
Saves the palaver of them trying
to spell my name.

50:24.191 --> 50:26.271
- Great to see you, David.
- You too, Chanel.

50:28.940 --> 50:32.820
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

51:17.820 --> 51:21.218
Chanel Dyson was the late Home
Secretary's PR, until she was fired.

51:21.259 --> 51:23.500
I witnessed her being picked up from
outside the Home Office in

51:23.540 --> 51:24.820
this same Range Rover.

51:24.860 --> 51:26.500
I ran the registration at the time.

51:26.540 --> 51:29.020
Found out it's owned by a company
based in the Cayman Islands.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.620
Rich girl gets top job. Shocker.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.700
That's what I thought at the time,
as well.

51:32.740 --> 51:35.291
But I've been thinking over everyone
who had the inside track on

51:35.332 --> 51:38.299
the Home Secretary, who could have
compromised her security.

51:38.340 --> 51:40.792
I mean, to kill a Cabinet minister,
think of the amount of people that

51:40.832 --> 51:44.838
would have had to turn a blind eye,
to not do their jobs properly.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.780
Some may have been zealots.

51:46.820 --> 51:49.314
But plenty others would just have
just taken a pay-off or ask

51:49.355 --> 51:50.955
no questions.

51:51.147 --> 51:54.227
That takes money or intimidation -
lots.

51:55.727 --> 51:58.461
Maybe it wasn't all down to the
Security Service, after all.

51:59.060 --> 52:02.140
The male subject has been
identified as Luke Aikens.

52:02.180 --> 52:06.494
Aikens is believed to be a senior figure
in organised criminal enterprises.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.111
Everyone focused on the
counter-terrorism aspect

52:12.152 --> 52:13.792
of RIPA 18.

52:14.260 --> 52:17.540
But enhanced surveillance on phone
and e-mail activity would be

52:17.580 --> 52:20.260
just as big a threat to
Organised Crime.

52:22.380 --> 52:24.380
No such thing as coincidences.

52:26.008 --> 52:29.768
Why's Chanel - and, by extension, Luke
Aikens - making contact with you?

52:32.540 --> 52:34.140
I don't know, Louise.

52:36.580 --> 52:38.220
Sorry. Is this a bad time?

52:38.260 --> 52:39.940
No worse than any other.

52:39.980 --> 52:41.660
They said it was all right.

52:41.700 --> 52:43.100
What's up, mate?

52:43.140 --> 52:45.260
Craddock's been trying to
get hold of you.

52:46.300 --> 52:47.340
OK.

52:49.100 --> 52:50.620
I'll drive you.

53:01.405 --> 53:04.627
Your repeated refusal to accept
counselling has raised

53:04.668 --> 53:07.148
concerns regarding your
fitness for duty.

53:07.189 --> 53:10.909
And now I've received an extremely
disturbing report regarding

53:10.950 --> 53:14.270
the possibility you've attempted
self-injury with a firearm.

53:14.377 --> 53:16.657
What report? Who from?

53:16.829 --> 53:20.080
David, I recognise an officer in
denial when I see one.

53:21.020 --> 53:22.625
This is for your own good.

53:22.666 --> 53:25.320
You're to go on indefinite
leave, as of now...

53:25.361 --> 53:25.940
Ma'am, no...

53:25.980 --> 53:28.700
...and I would strongly urge you to
accept treatment from

53:28.740 --> 53:29.978
Occupational Health.

53:30.019 --> 53:32.345
Ma'am, please,
I can't be removed from duty,

53:32.386 --> 53:34.252
till I've found who killed
Julia Montague.

53:34.293 --> 53:37.453
I'm also removing your firearms
ticket, for obvious reasons.

53:42.020 --> 53:43.180
I'm very sorry, David.

53:45.665 --> 53:47.525
This is for your own good.

53:56.019 --> 53:57.174
Neil.

54:19.463 --> 54:21.588
Need your blue card, mate.

54:26.129 --> 54:27.650
Signature, please.

54:37.140 --> 54:40.572
We're looking for a link with Luke
Aikens or any of his associates.

54:41.489 --> 54:42.969
I'm sorry.

54:44.443 --> 54:46.174
Give me a minute, guys.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.658
You fucked me over.

54:53.540 --> 54:54.939
What are you talking about?

54:54.980 --> 54:57.300
No. Don't play dumb.
I trusted you!

54:57.341 --> 54:58.877
I don't know what you...
