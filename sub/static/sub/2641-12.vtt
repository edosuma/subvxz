WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:05.188
Look at us. Getting ready for a double date

00:05.256 --> 00:07.324
with actual women who publicly acknowledge

00:07.391 --> 00:09.826
they're our girlfriends.

00:09.894 --> 00:13.196
Yes, actual women are the best.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.264
I don't understand.

00:14.332 --> 00:15.665
What other kind of women are there?

00:15.733 --> 00:18.668
Howard, artificial women
are your department.

00:18.736 --> 00:21.671
You want to take this?

00:21.739 --> 00:24.708
No, it would just freak him out.

00:24.775 --> 00:27.210
Listen, before we leave,

00:27.278 --> 00:30.213
I should warn you, I'm a passionate man

00:30.281 --> 00:33.750
and I tend towards public
displays of affection.

00:33.818 --> 00:37.654
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

00:37.722 --> 00:40.357
There might be some making out
in the car or the restaurant,

00:40.424 --> 00:42.259
and I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable,

00:42.326 --> 00:46.096
so it would help if you
and Penny made out, too.

00:46.164 --> 00:48.098
Don't worry.

00:48.166 --> 00:50.390
We're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.394
<i>Namaste, white people.</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:57.096
Good news!

00:57.164 --> 01:00.400
<i>I rented us the fou
r-hour edition of Watchmen.</i>

01:00.467 --> 01:01.334
Got it. Seen it.

01:01.402 --> 01:03.836
Detailed analysis posted online.

01:03.904 --> 01:06.205
Well, then what are we going to do tonight?

01:06.273 --> 01:07.440
Uh, sorry, Raj.

01:07.508 --> 01:08.641
Howard and I are going out to dinner

01:08.709 --> 01:10.009
with Penny and Bernadette. Yeah.

01:10.077 --> 01:12.712
No more carefree bachelor
nights for me and Leonard.

01:12.780 --> 01:15.248
These broncos have been saddled.

01:20.154 --> 01:22.121
<i>How did we get actual women?</i>

01:22.189 --> 01:24.123
Great.

01:24.191 --> 01:26.025
They get girlfriends,
and they just abandon us?

01:26.093 --> 01:27.994
It is great, isn't it?

01:29.330 --> 01:31.397
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us. We do?

01:31.465 --> 01:33.566
Oh, yes. I just discovered I don't have

01:33.634 --> 01:35.902
enough room on my hard drive
for a Linux partition,

01:35.970 --> 01:38.237
so you and I are going
to perform a full backup,

01:38.305 --> 01:41.574
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

01:41.642 --> 01:44.043
I don't want to do that.

01:44.111 --> 01:45.378
All right.

01:45.446 --> 01:47.380
Well, I'm going to perform full backup,

01:47.448 --> 01:50.883
reinitialize and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

01:50.951 --> 01:51.985
What about me?

01:52.052 --> 01:53.987
Well, I understand

01:54.054 --> 01:56.956
there are several types of artificial women.

01:58.325 --> 02:00.426
Maybe you should look into that.

02:02.162 --> 02:05.698
* Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state *

02:05.766 --> 02:09.524
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

02:09.592 --> 02:10.258
* The Earth began to cool *

02:10.327 --> 02:12.828
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

02:12.896 --> 02:15.364
<i>* We built the Wall * *
We built the pyramids *</i>

02:15.432 --> 02:18.034
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

02:18.101 --> 02:19.936
* That all started with a big bang *

02:23.922 --> 02:25.523
Dude, there's so many cool things

02:25.591 --> 02:27.392
we could be doing tonight. Look.

02:27.459 --> 02:29.227
At the Glendale Galleria,

02:29.295 --> 02:31.229
"Put on your best zoot suit,

02:31.297 --> 02:34.132
"it's a salute to Swing music
in the center court near Macy's.

02:34.199 --> 02:35.300
5:00 p.m. to 9 p.m."

02:35.367 --> 02:37.302
Huh? Huh?

02:37.369 --> 01:38.193
A salute to zoot.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.061 --> 02:41.029
Sounds like a hoot.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.963
I'm sorry, Raj,

02:43.031 --> 02:46.000
I have no desire to salute any
article of clothing tonight.

02:46.067 --> 02:49.503
Much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

02:49.571 --> 02:50.604
Race riots?

02:50.672 --> 02:52.973
The zoot suit riots.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.643
Oh.

02:55.710 --> 02:59.847
I always thought that was some
sort of after-Christmas sale.

03:01.850 --> 03:03.784
Well, then why don't we just go
to the galleria and walk around?

03:03.852 --> 03:05.786
But I don't need anything at the Galleria.

03:05.854 --> 03:07.454
Do you need anything at the Galleria?

03:07.522 --> 03:09.356
No. We would just walk
around and see what's what.

03:11.393 --> 03:14.795
That's a semantically null sentence.

03:14.863 --> 03:17.298
Okay, well, how about this?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.133
From the university Web site:

03:19.200 --> 03:22.136
00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room,

03:22.203 --> 03:24.805
"mixer for grad students and faculty

03:24.873 --> 03:27.308
"of the science and humanities departments.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.310
"Whether you split atoms or infinitives,

03:29.377 --> 03:32.212
this is the place to be."

03:32.280 --> 03:35.482
Well, that's certainly amusing, but...

03:35.550 --> 03:37.518
I have no interest.

03:37.586 --> 03:39.186
Come on, Sheldon,

03:39.254 --> 03:41.522
the world is filled with
people doing things outside.

03:41.590 --> 03:42.856
Let's go outside.

03:42.924 --> 03:45.326
Outside is good.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.329
If outside is so good,
why has mankind spent thousands of years

03:48.396 --> 03:50.097
trying to perfect inside?

03:50.165 --> 03:52.366
I don't know, it's a marketing scheme.

03:53.802 --> 03:55.235
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,

03:55.303 --> 03:57.360
virile visitor from a foreign land

03:57.388 --> 04:00.657
and I need to strut my stuff.

04:00.724 --> 04:03.026
Let me offer you a compromise.

04:03.094 --> 04:06.563
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery,

04:06.630 --> 04:09.599
I use my imagination.

04:09.667 --> 04:10.800
Oh, boy.

04:10.868 --> 04:12.669
One of my favorite places

04:12.736 --> 04:14.571
to visit is the two-dimensional world

04:14.638 --> 04:17.072
described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy,

04:17.141 --> 04:18.308
"Flatland."

04:18.375 --> 04:20.944
I don't want to go to Flatland.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.946
You're only saying that because
you haven't been there.

04:26.117 --> 04:29.619
I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space

04:29.687 --> 04:32.956
and can only perceive the
edges of other objects.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.125
Oy.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.127
Is that you, Raj?

04:37.194 --> 04:39.462
I don't recognize your edge.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.464
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.134
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.402
Well, you're in luck.

04:46.470 --> 04:49.606
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

04:51.208 --> 04:55.145
Oh, look, there's a sexually
attractive line segment.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.680
You should chat her up.

04:57.748 --> 04:59.182
What? Tell her you're a circle.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.851
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

05:04.622 --> 05:06.189
I hope you're hungry, Bernadette.

05:06.257 --> 05:07.824
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.292
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.094
When you spend all day in a bio-lab,

05:11.162 --> 05:13.763
watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize small rodents,

05:13.831 --> 05:15.822
it really works up an appetite.

05:16.890 --> 05:18.824
Flesh-eating bacteria.

05:18.892 --> 05:20.826
And yet, I still want to kiss this woman.

05:20.894 --> 05:22.160
What does that tell you?

05:22.228 --> 05:24.162
That you'd be willing
to die a horrible death

05:24.230 --> 05:26.064
on the off-chance you'd get to second base?

05:27.267 --> 05:29.034
Oh, we're way past second base.

05:29.102 --> 05:30.369
Right, Howard?

05:30.436 --> 05:32.704
Well, we kind of disagree

05:32.772 --> 05:35.707
about what the bases are.

05:35.775 --> 05:37.609
How's your work going, Penny?

05:37.677 --> 05:39.111
Any acting jobs?

05:39.178 --> 05:41.280
Well, the last big thing
I did was this production

05:41.347 --> 05:43.682
<i>of Diary of Anne Frank above
a bowling alley.</i>

05:43.750 --> 05:47.252
But I think things might be
turning around pretty soon.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.354
Great. How come?

05:49.422 --> 05:51.556
Well, promise you won't make fun of me.

05:51.624 --> 05:53.992
Of course, I would never make fun of you.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.494
Okay.

05:55.561 --> 05:58.497
Well, I went to this psychic who
told me that if I cut my hair,

05:58.564 --> 06:00.565
I'm going to get a national commercial.

06:02.302 --> 06:03.936
Wh... Seriously?

06:04.003 --> 06:06.939
You're getting career advice from a psychic?

06:07.006 --> 06:10.375
Good job not making fun of her.

06:10.443 --> 06:12.544
She's not one of those phonies, okay.

06:12.612 --> 06:15.047
She wrote a book and has her own Web site.

06:15.114 --> 06:16.281
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

06:16.349 --> 06:18.717
They don't let just anyone have a Web site.

06:18.785 --> 06:21.219
Why are you being such a jerk?

06:21.287 --> 06:22.521
You're surprised?

06:22.588 --> 06:24.823
Your psychic tell you I
was going to be a jerk?

06:24.891 --> 06:27.092
Bite me.

06:28.628 --> 06:29.895
Come on, Penny.

06:29.963 --> 06:31.563
Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

06:31.631 --> 06:32.354
We're gonna make out back here.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.960
I'm sliding into third.

06:43.265 --> 06:44.466
Thanks for coming with me.

06:44.533 --> 06:45.800
Thanks for giving me

06:45.868 --> 06:48.003
<i>your limited edition Green Lantern
lantern.</i>

06:48.070 --> 06:50.605
Did you really have to bring it in with you?

06:50.673 --> 06:53.675
What if evil strikes and
my power ring runs low?

06:58.414 --> 07:00.348
Come on, let's get a drink. I don't drink.

07:00.416 --> 07:01.750
Yeah, well I do.

07:01.817 --> 07:04.019
<i>And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern,</i>

07:04.086 --> 07:05.620
I drink a lot.

07:05.688 --> 07:07.622
I'll have a screwdriver, please.

07:07.690 --> 07:10.025
Don't be chintzy with the screw.

07:10.092 --> 07:12.727
I would like a root beer float.

07:12.795 --> 07:15.697
Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.

07:15.765 --> 07:17.532
They don't?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.434
Well, apparently,
these people and I differ greatly

07:19.502 --> 07:21.469
on the definition of "party."

07:21.537 --> 07:23.805
He'll have a Shirley Temple.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.874
And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

07:29.078 --> 07:31.046
Okay,

07:31.113 --> 07:32.714
let's check out the females.

07:32.782 --> 07:34.049
All right.

07:34.116 --> 07:35.984
There's a female.

07:36.052 --> 07:37.519
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.

07:37.586 --> 07:38.820
She's like 80 years old.

07:38.888 --> 07:40.655
But she's female.

07:40.723 --> 07:42.157
Isn't that the game? No.

07:42.224 --> 07:43.725
I'm looking for a hookup.

07:43.793 --> 07:45.560
Oh, yes.

07:45.628 --> 07:47.062
So, the point of this exercise is

07:47.129 --> 07:49.731
for you to find someone to copulate with?

07:49.799 --> 07:51.232
Not so loud,

07:51.300 --> 07:52.390
but ideally, yes.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.693
Thanks.

07:56.761 --> 07:58.495
Thank you.

07:58.563 --> 08:00.831
And what is my function as "wingman?"

08:00.899 --> 08:02.466
You help me run my game.

08:02.533 --> 08:03.500
Okay.

08:03.568 --> 08:07.037
What is your game?

08:07.105 --> 08:09.239
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,

08:09.307 --> 08:11.308
you nod and agree.

08:12.410 --> 08:13.877
Hey, that's pretty cool.

08:13.945 --> 08:15.012
What is it?

08:15.079 --> 08:16.513
It's a limited edition

08:16.581 --> 08:18.015
<i>Green Lantern lantern.</i>

08:18.082 --> 08:21.852
My friend is looking for
someone to copulate with.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.654
You're very funny.

08:23.721 --> 08:24.688
I'm Abby.

08:24.756 --> 08:26.690
I'm Sheldon. How do you do?

08:26.758 --> 08:28.692
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.360
Call me Raj. Hi, Raj.

08:30.428 --> 08:31.695
Where are you from?

08:31.763 --> 08:34.030
The mysterious subcontinent of India.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.365
Ooh, India.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.534
<i>You know India? I saw Slumdog
Millionaire.</i>

08:37.602 --> 08:40.270
Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

08:42.373 --> 08:44.574
I thought your father was a gynecologist.

08:45.643 --> 08:46.944
I'm sorry.

08:50.682 --> 08:51.949
Martha, come here.

08:52.016 --> 08:53.283
Meet Raj and Sheldon.

08:53.351 --> 08:54.718
This is my friend, Martha. Hi.

08:54.786 --> 08:55.986
Hello. Hello.

08:56.054 --> 08:57.821
Is that the limited edition

08:57.889 --> 08:59.489
<i>Green Lantern lantern?</i>

08:59.557 --> 09:02.659
"In brightest day, in darkest night,

09:02.727 --> 09:04.728
no evil shall escape my sight."

09:07.365 --> 09:09.323
Oh, that is so awesome.

09:10.691 --> 09:11.924
Thank you.

09:11.992 --> 09:14.327
Have you chosen one to copulate with?

09:26.907 --> 09:30.576
So, what should we talk about?

09:31.745 --> 09:33.679
Well, we could always learn more

09:33.747 --> 09:36.048
about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots.

09:36.116 --> 09:37.383
Leonard?

09:40.721 --> 09:42.655
Oh, we don't need to
talk about that anymore.

09:42.723 --> 09:45.191
Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.

09:45.259 --> 09:48.628
I'm sorry, but facts are facts.

09:48.695 --> 09:50.329
Right, and if you can't understand it,

09:50.397 --> 09:51.964
it's not a fact.

09:52.032 --> 09:55.134
No, if it's not a fact, it's not a fact.

09:55.202 --> 09:56.135
Oh, got it.

09:56.203 --> 09:57.336
Thank you for educating me.

09:57.404 --> 10:00.606
You're welcome.

10:00.674 --> 10:01.741
How's your fish?

10:01.809 --> 10:02.742
Amazing.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.043
Would you like to try some?

10:04.111 --> 10:05.211
Yeah, sure. Well, the fact is,

10:05.279 --> 10:07.380
you can't.

10:07.448 --> 10:10.183
Come on, Howard, Bernadette,
you're both scientists.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.517
Help me out here.

10:11.585 --> 10:12.919
What do you think-- want to jump

10:12.986 --> 10:14.187
right in the middle of
another couple's argument?

10:14.254 --> 10:15.188
No, thank you.

10:15.255 --> 10:16.556
Sorry.

10:17.758 --> 10:20.893
Maybe we should just
stop talking about this.

10:20.961 --> 10:23.896
Maybe some of us should
stop talking altogether.

10:23.964 --> 10:25.898
How is everything tonight?

10:25.966 --> 10:28.067
Really uncomfortable.

10:30.994 --> 10:32.695
You know, the best thing
about being in a committed,

10:32.763 --> 10:34.663
monogamous, mutually supportive relationship

10:34.731 --> 10:36.565
is that even if you have different ideas,

10:36.633 --> 10:39.201
you can have a spirited debate,
yet still care for,

10:39.269 --> 10:41.437
even make love with...

10:43.473 --> 10:46.108
Want your fish?

10:49.446 --> 10:51.013
I knew you were going to do that.

10:51.081 --> 10:52.581
Doesn't make me psychic!

10:54.618 --> 10:57.953
Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse.

10:58.955 --> 11:01.157
* American woman *

11:01.224 --> 11:05.261
* Listen what I say... *

11:06.296 --> 11:08.230
What's going on?

11:08.298 --> 11:11.100
We scored.

11:12.202 --> 11:14.303
I'm the wingman.

11:14.371 --> 11:16.705
* American woman. *

11:22.213 --> 11:23.014
Hey.

11:23.081 --> 11:25.683
Laser. Had a great night last night.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.852
I don't like to kiss and tell,

11:27.920 --> 11:30.922
but somebody made it to eighth base.

11:32.724 --> 11:35.092
What the hell is eighth base?

11:35.160 --> 11:37.195
Seventh base with shirt off.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.865
Well, my shirt.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.200
How'd things go

11:42.267 --> 11:43.201
with Penny?

11:43.268 --> 11:44.869
Oh... couldn't be better.

11:50.097 --> 11:50.830
Are we taking

11:50.898 --> 11:54.501
our relationship frustrations
out on innocent Cylons?

11:54.569 --> 11:55.802
It's not just Cylons.

11:55.870 --> 11:57.103
Superman's next.

11:58.839 --> 12:01.474
All right, I was going to try to squeeze in

12:01.542 --> 12:02.909
a little more mocking before lunch,

12:02.977 --> 12:04.144
but I can come back later

12:04.212 --> 12:06.780
when you don't have a high-powered weapon.

12:06.847 --> 12:10.917
How can I go out with a woman
who believes in psychics?

12:10.985 --> 12:12.686
Hey, I once dated a girl

12:12.753 --> 12:15.021
who believed she was abducted by aliens.

12:15.089 --> 12:16.523
And that didn't bother you?

12:16.591 --> 12:17.924
Au contraire.

12:17.992 --> 12:20.860
It meant she was gullible and
open to a little probing.

12:20.928 --> 12:23.163
What am I supposed to do,

12:23.231 --> 12:25.765
pretend I believe something I
don't whenever I'm with Penny?

12:25.833 --> 12:28.835
Hey, I'm sure Penny fakes
all kinds of things

12:28.903 --> 12:31.371
when she's with you.

12:31.439 --> 12:35.242
Do me a favor-- lean over,
put your head right here.

12:35.309 --> 12:38.311
Let me show you another way to look at this.

12:38.379 --> 12:42.315
Here we have the universe of all women.

12:42.383 --> 12:43.450
These are the ones

12:43.517 --> 12:44.818
you want to sleep with.

12:44.885 --> 12:47.954
These are the women who believe
exactly what you believe.

12:48.022 --> 12:50.690
These are the women who would
be willing to sleep with you.

12:52.693 --> 12:55.629
And right there in the
little triple intersection...

12:55.696 --> 12:57.063
is your ideal mate.

12:57.131 --> 13:00.000
Odds are she's a short
physicist with low self-esteem

13:00.067 --> 13:03.236
who lives in a government
research facility in China.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.572
What's your point?

13:05.640 --> 13:08.164
In order to keep having a
sexual relationship with Penny,

13:08.181 --> 13:10.082
I have to give up everything I believe in--

13:10.150 --> 13:11.817
my intellectual integrity, the very nature

13:11.885 --> 13:13.519
of who I am?

13:13.587 --> 13:15.588
I can't do that, Howard.

13:15.655 --> 13:17.456
I respect that.

13:20.327 --> 13:21.327
What is that?

13:21.394 --> 13:22.528
Your new girlfriend.

13:23.563 --> 13:25.064
Have fun tonight.

13:28.135 --> 13:30.703
The dog...

13:30.771 --> 13:33.806
<i>koira.</i>

13:33.874 --> 13:36.342
The roof...

13:36.409 --> 13:39.512
<i>katto.</i>

13:39.579 --> 13:43.249
Grapes...

13:43.316 --> 13:45.484
<i>ryp leet.</i>

13:48.255 --> 13:50.089
One minute.

13:51.825 --> 13:54.126
<i>Sis  n.</i>

13:54.194 --> 13:56.395
What was that?

13:56.463 --> 13:57.797
It means "come in."

13:57.864 --> 13:59.098
It's taking forever to load

13:59.166 --> 14:01.267
the new operating system on my computer.

14:01.334 --> 14:03.602
I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom,

14:03.670 --> 14:06.539
and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.

14:09.543 --> 14:11.043
That's Hindi for

14:11.111 --> 14:12.711
"Whatever floats your boat."

14:12.779 --> 14:15.881
Uh, listen, I got a text
from that girl Abby,

14:15.949 --> 14:18.551
and she and her friend Martha
want to hang out with us again.

14:18.618 --> 14:19.552
What do you say?

14:19.619 --> 14:21.320
I don't say anything.

14:21.388 --> 14:23.022
I merely offer you a facial expression

14:23.089 --> 14:24.547
that suggests you've gone insane.

14:27.399 --> 14:27.999
I don't get it.

14:28.007 --> 14:29.074
You had a great time.

14:29.141 --> 14:31.276
Yes, exactly, I had a great time.

14:31.344 --> 14:33.378
That's done; I've moved on to other things.

14:33.446 --> 14:35.013
For example, after I learn Finnish,

14:35.081 --> 14:36.648
I'm not going to learn Finnish again.

14:36.716 --> 14:40.051
Please, Sheldon, I'm a lost Indian boy

14:40.119 --> 14:42.954
far from home, and I want a girlfriend

14:43.022 --> 14:44.389
and I want her to be Abby,

14:44.457 --> 14:46.291
and she'll only come over
if she can bring Martha.

14:46.359 --> 14:49.294
Raj, I highly doubt there is
any argument you can make,

14:49.362 --> 14:52.564
threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy,

14:52.632 --> 14:54.165
plea, invocation,

14:54.233 --> 14:57.636
<i>supplication, or... vetoomus</i>

14:57.703 --> 15:02.407
that you can employ that would
convince me to reconsider.

15:15.588 --> 15:20.258
<i>My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan
Lee.</i>

15:21.260 --> 15:23.061
Oh, my.

15:40.746 --> 15:43.371
I've admired these for years.

15:44.439 --> 15:46.240
So does that mean we can
go with the girls again?

15:46.307 --> 15:50.410
Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!

15:53.881 --> 15:56.183
You can't wear the hands on the date.

15:58.219 --> 16:01.488
Hulk sad.

16:03.825 --> 16:06.193
Hey.

16:08.162 --> 16:12.399
Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh?

16:12.467 --> 16:13.900
Not only is it courteous,

16:13.968 --> 16:15.235
it's safety smart.

16:15.303 --> 16:17.271
Every year, 15,000 fires are caused

16:17.338 --> 16:21.208
by accidental dryer lint ignition.

16:21.276 --> 16:22.276
Now you're supposed to say,

16:22.343 --> 16:24.211
"Wow, what an interesting fact.

16:24.279 --> 16:26.313
"Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy.

16:26.381 --> 16:28.415
I could never be mad at you."

16:28.483 --> 16:30.984
Wow, that's all you got

16:31.052 --> 16:32.786
after you were the most obnoxious person

16:32.854 --> 16:36.790
on a double date that
included Howard Wolowitz?

16:38.192 --> 16:39.593
No, I'm sorry.

16:39.661 --> 16:41.261
I really am. It's not right

16:41.329 --> 16:44.197
to mock what a person believes in.

16:44.265 --> 16:45.399
Thank you.

16:45.466 --> 16:47.267
Would you be willing to go to my psychic

16:47.335 --> 16:48.869
and see what it's all about?

16:48.936 --> 16:50.504
Would you be willing to read a book

16:50.571 --> 16:53.373
that concisely explains how
all psychics are frauds?

16:53.441 --> 16:55.742
I would not.

17:00.548 --> 17:02.939
Okay, let's go see your psychic.

17:03.007 --> 17:04.074
Really?

17:04.141 --> 17:06.576
Well, yeah, one of us has
to keep an open mind.

17:06.644 --> 17:07.844
You saying I don't have an open mind?

17:07.912 --> 17:09.746
No, n-not at all.
Let me help you with this stuff.

17:09.814 --> 17:13.450
You know, I believe in ghosts, too.

17:13.517 --> 17:15.151
Great. And astrology.

17:15.219 --> 17:19.155
I know, and pyramid power
and healing crystals.

17:19.223 --> 17:22.659
Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.

17:22.727 --> 17:25.662
Really, that's the line?

17:25.730 --> 17:28.330
Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?

17:28.398 --> 17:29.666
Oh, voodoo's real.

17:29.734 --> 17:32.168
You don't want to mess with voodoo.

17:34.505 --> 17:37.140
<i>Flatland is more than just a
mathematical essay.</i>

17:37.208 --> 17:40.343
It is also a treatise on
Victorian social mores.

17:40.411 --> 17:42.312
You know, I had never considered that.

17:46.117 --> 17:48.051
Wow, that's going to

17:48.119 --> 17:50.353
completely change my visits there.

17:59.363 --> 18:01.598
Well, it's late.

18:01.666 --> 18:02.799
Uh-huh.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.367
Time for bed.

18:04.435 --> 18:07.604
Okay.

18:08.639 --> 18:11.007
Good night, puny human!

18:20.073 --> 18:22.541
Sheldon?

18:28.914 --> 18:29.848
Yes?

18:29.916 --> 18:31.251
Listen, they're kind of

18:32.319 --> 18:34.243
getting busy in the living room, and...

18:34.261 --> 18:37.163
I was wondering if I could
hang out in here for a while.

18:38.198 --> 18:40.132
Well, I suppose.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.333
Come in.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.107
I'll sleep in Leonard's room. Good night.
