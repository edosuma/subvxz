WEBVTT

00:03.663 --> 00:05.630
Johnny: Moira! The water's ice cold!

00:05.731 --> 00:07.666
How long were you in here?!

00:08.029 --> 00:09.864
John, you know my ritual!

00:10.008 --> 00:12.610
Five to ten minutes
to let the water warm,

00:12.635 --> 00:13.820
there's the initial scrub,

00:13.845 --> 00:15.125
followed by the deep conditioner,

00:15.150 --> 00:16.851
which must set for 20 minutes,

00:17.015 --> 00:18.916
and finally, the double rinse cycle.

00:19.093 --> 00:21.127
Well, we can't be doing
that anymore, sweetheart!

00:21.152 --> 00:23.354
Our water bill is
going through the roof!

00:23.455 --> 00:26.790
Yes, painfully aware of our
budgetary constraints, John.

00:26.891 --> 00:30.503
I'm currently reading a
magazine from July, 1987.

00:30.528 --> 00:32.363
Where do you even find these?

00:32.464 --> 00:33.641
Alexis: So I just signed for this,

00:33.665 --> 00:35.165
so does that mean I get to keep it?

00:35.190 --> 00:37.659
- Also, what is it?
- Oh my God, it's here.

00:37.836 --> 00:39.922
- Give it some room, Alexis!
- Give what some room?

00:39.947 --> 00:41.681
What exactly are you getting

00:41.706 --> 00:44.041
shipped from "Harrod's of London?"

00:44.142 --> 00:46.170
Family, I'd like to you
to meet a dear friend

00:46.203 --> 00:48.154
whom I've yet to meet.

00:48.179 --> 00:52.016
Give a warm dobrodosli
to my red carpet gown

00:52.041 --> 00:53.775
for the "Crows" premiere.

00:53.921 --> 00:56.429
Moira, you didn't tell
me they'd set a date

00:56.454 --> 00:58.255
- for the premiere!
- Yes!

00:58.280 --> 01:01.076
I've been told
definitively it will happen,

01:01.101 --> 01:03.803
and I quote, "ideally
sometime this year."

01:03.828 --> 01:05.373
Okay, there must be some mistake here.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.798
This is valued at $3,700.

01:07.823 --> 01:11.177
What?! $3,700?

01:11.202 --> 01:13.303
What designer gave you
that kind of discount?

01:13.405 --> 01:15.806
Sadly, it's not custom
this time around, Alexis.

01:15.907 --> 01:18.075
Mommy had to shop off the rack.

01:18.176 --> 01:19.843
Fortunately, I discovered
something called

01:19.868 --> 01:23.256
- a "promo code."
- This is a reduced price?

01:23.281 --> 01:25.367
Yes. Discount couture,
do you believe it?

01:25.392 --> 01:27.627
I'm surprised she made
it through customs.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.764
I once passed off a mini
horse and three Guinea pigs

01:29.788 --> 01:32.256
as service animals, so
anything is possible.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.078
Perfect a spot of tea for the unveiling.

01:35.103 --> 01:37.918
I was actually just
boiling water for my bath.

01:37.943 --> 01:39.573
Does this mean I should
start thinking about my look

01:39.597 --> 01:40.798
for the premiere?

01:40.823 --> 01:42.876
TBD on the guest list, Alexis,

01:42.901 --> 01:45.069
but I love your enthusiasm.

01:45.094 --> 01:46.828
Box? Box.

01:48.466 --> 01:53.070
-- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe --
-- www.addic7ed.com --

01:54.846 --> 01:56.223
David: I'm so glad we're doing this.

01:56.247 --> 01:58.525
We never get to spend
quality time together.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.760
Also, I've been neglecting
my wellness journey,

02:00.785 --> 02:03.025
so the cherry blossoms opening
when we both have time off

02:03.050 --> 02:04.684
is really ticking a lot of boxes for me.

02:04.789 --> 02:06.634
Are you sure the cherry
blossoms are even open now?

02:06.658 --> 02:09.044
I mean, I thought that wasn't
for another couple weeks.

02:09.068 --> 02:10.937
Mm, no, no, I called
the botanical gardens,

02:10.961 --> 02:12.529
and had the girl send me a photo.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.865
I learned the hard way
from my last trip to Japan.

02:14.890 --> 02:17.811
Showed up, no cherry blossoms,
turned right back around,

02:17.836 --> 02:19.169
it was such a waste.

02:19.194 --> 02:22.182
Wow, that's a lot of pressure
to put on cherry blossoms.

02:22.207 --> 02:24.408
Well, why else would we
be driving to Elm Valley?

02:24.433 --> 02:25.900
Ooh!

02:28.910 --> 02:31.841
Why else would we be driving
to Elm Valley, Stevie?

02:32.661 --> 02:35.729
The only other reason
I can think of is that...

02:35.754 --> 02:37.588
Emir might be there.

02:37.765 --> 02:39.966
The hotel reviewer that...

02:39.991 --> 02:41.792
You had the dirty motel sex with?

02:41.893 --> 02:44.161
Well, when you put it that
way it sorta cheapens it,

02:44.186 --> 02:47.207
but yes, he might also be there,

02:47.232 --> 02:49.099
reviewing a hotel.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.478
But not the hotel that we're going to,

02:51.503 --> 02:53.504
because that would be
a crazy coincidence.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.709
Sorry, I knew you wouldn't come

02:58.734 --> 03:00.687
if you thought you were
gonna be a third wheel.

03:00.719 --> 03:01.986
Okay well, sucks for him,

03:02.011 --> 03:03.990
because I only booked
the private garden tour

03:04.015 --> 03:05.271
for two people.

03:05.304 --> 03:07.225
- Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
- Please don't.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.362
I don't think we're gonna go...

03:09.387 --> 03:11.088
- No!
- To the botanical gardens.

03:11.189 --> 03:13.190
Wow! So this is an abduction, then.

03:13.368 --> 03:17.504
I am a single woman
driving way out of town

03:17.529 --> 03:20.216
to meet a guy I don't know very well!

03:20.241 --> 03:21.374
Well...

03:21.399 --> 03:23.467
Once he shows up I'm
sure you can still go

03:23.492 --> 03:25.126
to the botanical gardens!

03:25.151 --> 03:28.005
I'm not going to the
botanical gardens by myself!

03:28.030 --> 03:30.431
What, am I gonna walk around,
and admire the cherry blossoms

03:30.456 --> 03:32.591
alone, like some pervert?!

03:33.154 --> 03:34.654
So if you're gonna meet this guy there,

03:34.679 --> 03:36.439
there where am I staying?
I don't do couches!

03:36.464 --> 03:38.031
I got you a separate room.

03:38.225 --> 03:39.859
A separate room, okay.

03:39.884 --> 03:41.618
So this has all been premeditated, then.

03:41.795 --> 03:43.663
You know what, I hope for your sake,

03:43.688 --> 03:45.169
that they have cherry
blossoms in prison.

03:49.427 --> 03:50.961
Hey Shannon, what's up?

03:51.062 --> 03:53.564
Ted's in his office, you
can just let yourself in.

03:53.589 --> 03:54.789
Yikes.

03:54.814 --> 03:56.748
Okay, thank you.

04:00.443 --> 04:03.540
Hey, I know you're really swamped today,

04:03.565 --> 04:05.099
so I brought you this.

04:05.276 --> 04:06.877
- You can thank me later.
- Oh!

04:06.902 --> 04:08.436
That's decaf, right?

04:08.613 --> 04:11.024
No, that detail
actually slipped my mind,

04:11.049 --> 04:12.916
so maybe I'll just take it.

04:13.094 --> 04:15.512
Oh, almost a sweet
gesture, Alexis, thank you.

04:15.537 --> 04:17.096
You know who's not sweet?

04:17.668 --> 04:19.165
Old Shan out there.

04:19.266 --> 04:21.668
Okay, first of all
Alexis, she's not old,

04:21.692 --> 04:22.933
we went to vet school together.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.703
And she's actually been
really helpful this week.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.339
To you.

04:26.896 --> 04:29.442
I'm just gonna say it,
Ted. Most people are a fan.

04:29.467 --> 04:31.921
So when someone's not,
it's usually on them.

04:31.946 --> 04:34.447
All right, fine, I, I
didn't wanna bring this up,

04:34.472 --> 04:37.662
because it is so not a thing.

04:38.147 --> 04:41.154
But well, when you and I were broken up,

04:41.179 --> 04:44.615
there was... one night
where Shannon and I...

04:44.716 --> 04:46.984
Oh my God! Ted!

04:47.009 --> 04:48.442
We hooked up.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.493
Yes you did, you little smooch monster!

04:50.521 --> 04:52.089
Well, we did a lot more than that.

04:52.114 --> 04:53.833
I'm sorry, should I be jealous?

04:53.858 --> 04:55.936
No! No, no, no, no, no. It
was just a one-time thing.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.029
- Oh, no.
- No, not "oh no,"

04:59.054 --> 05:01.708
No, I stopped it from going any further.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.744
Because I thought we were
just better off as friends.

05:03.768 --> 05:05.311
Beep, beep!

05:05.336 --> 05:07.823
Paging Dr. Casanova J. Heartbreaker.

05:07.848 --> 05:09.983
Anyway, that's probably
why she seems like

05:10.008 --> 05:12.309
she's a little unsure about
where she stands with you.

05:12.410 --> 05:13.921
Well, thank you for
telling me that, Ted.

05:13.945 --> 05:16.131
That makes so much more
sense than her not liking me.

05:16.156 --> 05:18.024
Well, I'm glad that
we could clear that up.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.461
Okay, well, I will
see you for lunch then,

05:21.486 --> 05:22.755
"Doctor".

05:22.780 --> 05:25.457
Yeah, it's funny because
I actually am a doctor.

05:25.482 --> 05:26.833
So am I...

05:27.099 --> 05:29.867
No, you're not. Just-just Ted.

05:30.695 --> 05:32.496
Roland: Hey, Johnny!

05:32.521 --> 05:36.018
Johnny! I have some good
news for you, my friend.

05:36.043 --> 05:37.844
Well, I could use some good news,

05:37.869 --> 05:40.003
I might have to take out
a mortgage on the dress

05:40.028 --> 05:42.448
- my wife just bought.
- Well, uh...

05:42.473 --> 05:44.518
you know that little hot
water problem you're having?

05:44.543 --> 05:45.544
Yeah?

05:45.569 --> 05:47.546
Well, I've come up with
the perfect excuse for you

05:47.571 --> 05:50.223
to buy yourself a brand
new hot water heater!

05:50.662 --> 05:52.392
Still waiting for the good news.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.418
Well, the good news
is that my friend Terry

05:54.443 --> 05:56.410
can replace the whole thing for you.

05:56.454 --> 05:57.822
- Replace it?
- Mhmm.

05:58.056 --> 05:59.589
Well, how much is that gonna cost?

05:59.614 --> 06:02.101
I did a little negotiating with Terry,

06:02.126 --> 06:04.561
and he says you can have it for $4,200.

06:04.738 --> 06:06.506
- $4200?!
- Right.

06:06.531 --> 06:08.165
Unless you want it installed.

06:08.342 --> 06:11.110
Well, of course I want
it installed, Roland!

06:11.135 --> 06:12.869
Okay, well, that's gonna be $5,500.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.294
Okay, you know what?

06:14.548 --> 06:17.016
I can't afford to throw
away money like that.

06:17.136 --> 06:19.386
Oh, come on, this coming from
the guy who was just bragging

06:19.410 --> 06:22.079
about taking out a mortgage
to pay for his wife's dress!

06:22.104 --> 06:23.957
- I wasn't bragging!
- Ohhh...

06:23.982 --> 06:25.415
Moira: Well, hello!

06:25.440 --> 06:27.660
Is it just me, or is there
a faint scent of honeysuckle

06:27.685 --> 06:28.919
in the air?

06:29.096 --> 06:31.397
Yeah, it might be Johnny's aftershave.

06:31.422 --> 06:34.057
I'm-I'm sorry, it is pungent.

06:34.550 --> 06:37.036
And John, I tried to hang up my gown,

06:37.061 --> 06:39.563
and thank God I caught it
before that silly curtain rod

06:39.588 --> 06:41.355
came crashing down!

06:41.380 --> 06:43.209
Don't worry about it,
we'll get you a new one.

06:43.234 --> 06:45.369
As soon we get uh, "El Tightwad" here

06:45.394 --> 06:47.094
to loosen up the purse strings.

06:47.119 --> 06:49.082
John, give this man a raise!

06:49.107 --> 06:52.466
And when dear, did our
room become so moist?

06:52.776 --> 06:55.895
I'm off to get a dehumidifier,
but I will see you at lunch.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:06.689 --> 07:07.981
Oh, is that him?

07:09.127 --> 07:11.328
- No.
- Okay.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.174
- What about the person...
- David, I would tell you

07:14.198 --> 07:15.532
if I saw him!

07:17.737 --> 07:19.204
Also, that's rude!

07:19.229 --> 07:21.349
Okay, it's just that your
type is very inconsistent.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.443
What time was he supposed
to show up, anyway?

07:26.288 --> 07:27.822
Two hours ago.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.815
And we're sure this is the right hotel?

07:31.393 --> 07:33.613
He's not coming. I'm an idiot.

07:34.728 --> 07:38.073
Well, I guess the good thing
to come out of this abduction

07:38.098 --> 07:40.600
is that if anyone knows
how to crawl out from under

07:40.625 --> 07:43.560
an embarrassing romantic
failure, it's me.

07:43.661 --> 07:46.396
So I say we drop our bags,

07:46.573 --> 07:48.307
go straight to the botanical gardens,

07:48.332 --> 07:50.100
take in some cherry blossoms,

07:50.125 --> 07:52.278
then sleep it off, and
go home fresh tomorrow.

07:52.443 --> 07:54.578
What time was the tour again?

07:58.976 --> 08:01.311
Oh, David, I'm so sorry.

08:01.801 --> 08:03.814
If this wasn't so humiliating for you,

08:03.915 --> 08:06.283
I think I'd be in a
darker headspace right now,

08:06.384 --> 08:08.251
but since it is...

08:08.886 --> 08:10.930
the hotel bar has karaoke,

08:10.955 --> 08:13.442
I say we get several
rounds of polar bear shots,

08:13.467 --> 08:15.334
load up some Mariah,

08:15.359 --> 08:16.839
and I will spend the rest of the night

08:16.864 --> 08:18.431
pretending not to resent you.

08:18.596 --> 08:19.855
Okay.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.467
I'll get the first round.

08:21.492 --> 08:22.892
Oh, you'll be getting every round.

08:28.027 --> 08:30.268
Alexis: Oh my God, Shan! You still here?

08:30.293 --> 08:32.184
Have you not taken lunch?

08:32.210 --> 08:33.510
I've just been pretty busy.

08:33.534 --> 08:34.902
Ugh, same.

08:35.078 --> 08:37.047
Can I get a "hell yeah"
for two hard-working women

08:37.072 --> 08:38.639
in the 21st Century?

08:40.782 --> 08:44.152
Anyway, I think that we both know

08:44.177 --> 08:45.977
that things are a bit off between us,

08:46.002 --> 08:47.702
and I understand why.

08:48.002 --> 08:49.836
Ted told me all about your little...

08:49.861 --> 08:51.480
Mmm! Muah! Muah!

08:51.557 --> 08:54.125
And it's like... not a big deal.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.409
Okay.

08:56.957 --> 08:59.011
Alexis, that's-that's such a relief.

08:59.036 --> 09:01.304
And oh! Honestly, between us,

09:01.405 --> 09:03.340
it was just a drunken one-time thing,

09:03.365 --> 09:05.366
and I told him we'd be
better off as friends.

09:05.543 --> 09:07.077
Oh.

09:07.102 --> 09:09.738
Did you tell him that
after he told you that?

09:09.814 --> 09:11.014
Sorry?

09:11.039 --> 09:12.807
Ted: Alexis. Right on time.

09:13.060 --> 09:15.795
You're telling me, I was
just having a chat with Shan.

09:16.441 --> 09:18.131
Clearing the air about that little trip

09:18.156 --> 09:19.908
you two took to pound town.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.434
- Alexis!
- Whoa!

09:21.459 --> 09:23.337
Okay, let's remember this
is still a place of work.

09:23.361 --> 09:24.771
Look, I don't know about you, Shannon,

09:24.795 --> 09:26.730
but I am so glad we did this.

09:26.755 --> 09:28.733
Had I not talked to her,
I never would've found out

09:28.758 --> 09:30.592
that she called it off.

09:30.768 --> 09:34.440
- Maybe I will go for lunch.
- Well, just, um, one minute.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.549
Again, not that it matters,

09:36.574 --> 09:39.576
you know, but uh, the day after we...

09:40.449 --> 09:44.181
um, we were supposed to meet
up at the 5k for Feral Cats,

09:44.206 --> 09:47.527
and... I never followed up so.

09:47.559 --> 09:51.862
- Oh! Yeah, it totally doesn't matter.
- No.

09:52.032 --> 09:54.563
But I also never followed up.

09:54.588 --> 09:56.993
So when we saw each
other the next weekend

09:57.018 --> 09:59.286
at the opening of Bronwyn's
Exotic Animal Clinic,

09:59.311 --> 10:02.141
I assumed... you'd gotten the hint.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.100
Okay, well, that's what I assumed, so...

10:04.125 --> 10:06.059
Okay, not to interject, but I assumed

10:06.084 --> 10:08.346
that this would play out in
a much more interesting way.

10:08.382 --> 10:10.349
So for the sake of time,

10:10.374 --> 10:12.883
um, I'm just gonna go with
Shannon's version of things.

10:12.908 --> 10:15.000
Shannon, can we get you
anything while we're out?

10:15.025 --> 10:16.390
Uh, I'm not sure that we
actually quite finished

10:16.414 --> 10:17.934
- the conversation.
- Oh, it's okay, Ted.

10:18.015 --> 10:19.416
Because the important thing is,

10:19.441 --> 10:20.679
that Shannon and I had a breakthrough.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.821
Yeah, but I'm just not really
sure where we landed on...

10:22.846 --> 10:24.080
- Mhmm, yeah.
- On the whole...

10:24.105 --> 10:26.173
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Okay.

10:28.993 --> 10:30.594
When it comes to water heater repairs,

10:30.771 --> 10:33.039
you don't need electrical
experience to check,

10:33.064 --> 10:34.931
or replace the heating elements.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.375
Great.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.068
The only thing you need to do...

10:38.578 --> 10:41.271
is make sure the power is off
before you perform any tests...

10:41.296 --> 10:42.997
Okay, where's the power switch?

10:43.173 --> 10:44.984
I need the power switch,
okay, hold on, hold on.

10:45.009 --> 10:46.509
- Find the circuit breaker...
- Power?

10:46.534 --> 10:48.988
I can't get to the circuit
breaker until-hold on!

10:49.013 --> 10:51.548
Slow... slow-hold on!

10:51.573 --> 10:53.516
Hold-st-stop!

10:53.541 --> 10:55.308
Rewind! How do you rewind?!

10:55.333 --> 10:56.834
Where's the manual?!

10:56.859 --> 10:58.757
Oh Johnny, there you are!

10:58.782 --> 11:00.216
I've been looking all over for you.

11:00.358 --> 11:02.325
Urgent question. Um...

11:02.350 --> 11:04.885
what's our policy on smoke breaks?

11:04.910 --> 11:07.006
- Who's taking a smoke break?
- I am.

11:07.031 --> 11:08.932
- You don't smoke.
- Yeah, I know.

11:08.957 --> 11:11.091
And I don't think I should
be penalized for that.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.980
Roland, I'm kinda busy right
now with the water heater.

11:14.005 --> 11:15.538
Johnny, I don't think kicking

11:15.563 --> 11:17.297
that thing is really gonna help.

11:17.475 --> 11:18.708
LOL.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.953
Okay, I'm trying to
follow the video here,

11:20.978 --> 11:22.445
it says it's for beginners.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.348
Yeah well, I think you
got the right video there.

11:24.448 --> 11:26.393
But don't you think something
like that should be handled

11:26.417 --> 11:29.052
by professionals, Johnny?
Like, maybe... Terry?

11:29.153 --> 11:31.087
Roland, you know something?

11:31.188 --> 11:33.033
There's a lot going on
with the family right now,

11:33.057 --> 11:36.326
and if there's an economical
way for me to deal with this,

11:36.351 --> 11:38.128
without pumping more money into it,

11:38.229 --> 11:39.596
then that's what I'm gonna do!

11:39.621 --> 11:40.726
Johnny, let me tell you something.

11:40.751 --> 11:42.967
That is not the place to cut corners.

11:42.992 --> 11:45.149
Okay? What you need to do is re-examine

11:45.174 --> 11:47.046
your extravagant lifestyle.

11:47.071 --> 11:48.312
What are you talking about?

11:48.361 --> 11:51.828
Well, not all of us can drive
around in an 8 cylinder car.

11:51.853 --> 11:55.382
It's a '78 Lincoln, and
it's all we could afford!

11:55.407 --> 11:57.445
- Right, '78. Vintage.
- Okay!

11:57.470 --> 11:59.375
Roland, do you mind
if I get back to work?!

11:59.400 --> 12:01.835
Yeah, no problem, I've got
to go on my smoke break.

12:10.502 --> 12:14.970
♪ As time goes on...

12:18.845 --> 12:21.274
Wow, for someone who can barely stand,

12:21.299 --> 12:23.067
she sounds good.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.126
How are we feeling?

12:25.181 --> 12:28.257
All things considered,
I'm feeling better.

12:28.282 --> 12:30.248
Good. I'm gonna see if
they have more Mariah,

12:30.273 --> 12:32.107
the first three songs
were just a warm-up.

12:40.345 --> 12:42.440
Oh. Hi.

12:42.541 --> 12:44.142
I'm so sorry.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.978
A student driver rear-ended
me on the way over here,

12:46.002 --> 12:47.745
it was a whole thing. He started crying.

12:47.770 --> 12:49.456
We had to exchange
insurance information.

12:49.481 --> 12:51.133
His mom was there.

12:51.158 --> 12:52.759
You couldn'tve called?

12:52.936 --> 12:54.403
I thought I was stood up.

12:54.428 --> 12:56.388
The student driver has
my phone, and I have his.

12:56.430 --> 12:57.931
We didn't give them back to each other

12:57.956 --> 12:59.275
after we exchanged info.

12:59.314 --> 13:01.092
So if you wanna know what's
on a 16 year old's smartphone,

13:01.116 --> 13:02.483
I could offer you that.

13:02.661 --> 13:03.994
No, thank you.

13:04.019 --> 13:05.786
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

13:06.329 --> 13:08.431
Okay, good news, they have "Fantasy,"

13:08.456 --> 13:11.376
which means that you get
to play Ol' Dirty Bastard.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.504
Oh, are-are you here with someone?

13:13.528 --> 13:16.063
- Uh, no.
- Oh! Ohhh...

13:16.240 --> 13:18.041
Oh um, no.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.900
We just ran into each other at the bar.

13:20.001 --> 13:22.336
Um, long story short, I took
a pottery class with this one.

13:24.259 --> 13:25.815
Oh, uh, I'm Emir.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.160
- Oh, Dane... a. Dana.
- Dana?

13:28.185 --> 13:31.421
Yeah, so I run-I run
the karaoke at the hotel.

13:31.446 --> 13:33.501
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

13:33.774 --> 13:36.470
Uh, Stevie, I know I'm two hours late,

13:36.495 --> 13:38.295
but can I still take you to dinner,

13:38.320 --> 13:39.453
or have I blown it?

13:39.630 --> 13:41.531
Oh, you've blown it.

13:41.632 --> 13:43.099
But I'll still take a free dinner.

13:43.712 --> 13:45.068
- I can work with that, okay.
- Okay.

13:45.093 --> 13:46.712
- Mhmm.
- Okay!

13:46.737 --> 13:49.072
Um, I'm just gonna settle up my tab,

13:49.097 --> 13:51.324
- I'll meet you outside.
- Okay, yeah.

13:51.349 --> 13:52.816
Uh, nice to meet you, Dana.

13:53.221 --> 13:55.022
Yes, thanks.

13:58.439 --> 13:59.749
Why don't you just come with us?

14:00.329 --> 14:02.018
I already made you miss
the botanical gardens.

14:02.043 --> 14:03.344
I can't leave you here.

14:03.444 --> 14:05.121
Okay, honestly, I'm
gonna be really exhausted

14:05.146 --> 14:06.613
after my set anyways, so...

14:06.791 --> 14:09.092
I'll probably just go to bed.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.927
Are you sure?

14:10.952 --> 14:13.721
No, so get outta here
before I change my mind.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.723
- Thank you.
- Okay.

14:15.748 --> 14:17.582
Unnecessary, but...

14:20.228 --> 14:22.048
Keep the mics hot, I'm comin' in!

14:29.137 --> 14:31.438
Moira? We need to talk, sweetheart.

14:31.539 --> 14:33.707
I'm sorry dear, is your mouth moving?

14:34.350 --> 14:37.378
Could you uh, turn off the
dehumidifier for a second?

14:37.479 --> 14:39.012
Because I can't possibly

14:39.114 --> 14:41.348
hear you over the sound
of the dehumidifier!

14:41.373 --> 14:43.498
Oh, just-just turn off...

14:47.068 --> 14:49.966
So, it looks like in
addition to the water heater,

14:49.991 --> 14:52.779
we're gonna have to replace
some of the plumbing.

14:53.137 --> 14:55.138
And the water is so hard,

14:55.163 --> 14:58.676
that Terry said that it's
likely in the next little while

14:58.732 --> 15:00.989
we might also need a new...

15:01.014 --> 15:02.445
water softener.

15:02.546 --> 15:04.714
John, I'm sorry you've
had such a hard day.

15:04.739 --> 15:07.145
- Yeah...
- On the upside,

15:07.170 --> 15:10.928
this gown has exceeded all expectations.

15:11.264 --> 15:12.765
Yeah, well that's good, sweetheart,

15:12.790 --> 15:15.134
that's... that's good.
It's just that um,

15:15.159 --> 15:17.570
you know, with all
these costs piling up,

15:17.595 --> 15:19.963
we might need to take a hard look at uh,

15:19.988 --> 15:23.356
some of our recent uh... purchases.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.649
I told Alexis now is not the time

15:25.674 --> 15:27.060
to expand that home office.

15:27.085 --> 15:29.453
Not with the price of ink today.

15:29.478 --> 15:32.365
Yeah... Moira, look.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.301
The last thing I want to do is uh...

15:35.326 --> 15:37.494
rain on your parade,

15:37.595 --> 15:39.196
but I think for the next little while,

15:39.221 --> 15:42.041
any money coming in should probably...

15:42.066 --> 15:43.934
be for the family.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.993
This dress is for the family.

15:46.170 --> 15:49.406
To remind us that our
futures lie outside this town.

15:49.826 --> 15:51.517
It feels these days
like I'm the only one

15:51.542 --> 15:53.243
who hasn't veered off course.

15:53.268 --> 15:54.912
Well, no one's veering
off course, Moira,

15:54.937 --> 15:58.936
we're all just uh...
taking a different approach.

15:59.881 --> 16:01.461
The ceremonial purchase of the gown

16:01.486 --> 16:03.353
has always been my good luck charm.

16:04.022 --> 16:06.189
Well, from everything you've
told us about this movie,

16:06.214 --> 16:10.647
Moira, it sounds like for
the first time in a long time,

16:10.672 --> 16:11.862
you may not need any luck.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.941
Oh, John! Thank you for that.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.310
And know that you've been heard!

16:17.335 --> 16:18.802
Good.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.023
Ted: You know, Alexis,
I've been thinking about it,

16:30.047 --> 16:32.215
and... I'm really glad
that you and Shannon

16:32.240 --> 16:34.293
were able to get
everything out in the open.

16:34.868 --> 16:37.492
Me too. We're actually
grabbing drinks tomorrow.

16:37.517 --> 16:39.385
Great, yeah, you know, and I-I...

16:39.410 --> 16:43.331
I care way more about that
than any of the details

16:43.356 --> 16:45.491
of how we ended things,

16:45.516 --> 16:48.251
or even whether they were accurate.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.363
It seems like it was just
like a little miscommunication

16:50.387 --> 16:51.921
on your part, is all.

16:51.946 --> 16:54.481
Yeah well, uh, Shannon aside,

16:54.506 --> 16:56.235
I think it's important that I tell you

16:56.260 --> 16:58.404
that there were a few
others before Heather.

16:58.429 --> 17:00.463
And there may have been

17:00.488 --> 17:02.589
a couple of broken hearts along the way.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.023
Whatever you say, Ted.

17:06.406 --> 17:08.814
Yeah... it's actually kinda funny,

17:08.839 --> 17:10.740
because I was just
going through my phone,

17:10.765 --> 17:12.584
you know, to make some
space, and then I came across

17:12.608 --> 17:14.662
this little back and
forth from a while ago.

17:14.686 --> 17:16.387
I believe you, Ted.

17:16.489 --> 17:18.532
You're still Dr. Casanova to me.

17:18.558 --> 17:20.224
Okay, well, the tone of your voice

17:20.250 --> 17:21.742
makes it seem like you don't
believe a word you're saying.

17:21.768 --> 17:22.977
Okay, Ted!

17:26.295 --> 17:27.795
"Dear Melanie."

17:28.435 --> 17:30.547
Melanie? Is this the girl
from the falafel place?

17:30.572 --> 17:32.440
Yeah, I don't think that's relevant.

17:32.839 --> 17:35.374
Ahem. "I've had a lot of
fun hanging out with you,

17:35.399 --> 17:37.454
and I really...

17:37.479 --> 17:41.413
fal-awful saying this over text,

17:41.438 --> 17:43.906
but I'm just not feeling
strongly enough to take

17:43.931 --> 17:46.766
this to the next level. I'm sorry."

17:47.020 --> 17:49.555
Pretty harsh. But it had to be done.

17:50.172 --> 17:51.824
And then um, she wrote...

17:51.849 --> 17:54.910
- Oh, it doesn't matter what she wrote.
- "Cool!" Exclamation mark.

17:55.201 --> 17:58.297
And it looks like you ended
up walking her dog for her?

17:58.322 --> 18:00.790
Well, she seemed really upset.

18:01.146 --> 18:02.719
Listen Ted,

18:03.158 --> 18:05.237
I've gone through enough
heartbreakers for like,

18:05.262 --> 18:07.263
two people's lifetimes.

18:07.364 --> 18:09.365
And I don't want that anymore.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.501
I want you.

18:12.269 --> 18:14.270
And that cute lil' butt.

18:16.362 --> 18:20.853
David and Tammy: ♪ Ohhhh...

18:20.878 --> 18:22.386
Oh! Oh!

18:22.413 --> 18:24.614
Yes, Tammy! Tammy, everybody!

18:24.639 --> 18:26.340
It's Tammy! Yeah!

18:26.365 --> 18:28.165
Stevie, hi!

18:28.190 --> 18:29.657
Oh...

18:30.063 --> 18:32.664
- Hi!
- Hi.

18:33.094 --> 18:37.097
So... Emir asked me if I
wanted to stay the night.

18:37.270 --> 18:39.738
Ohhhh!

18:39.763 --> 18:41.050
That sounds promising.

18:41.075 --> 18:44.000
Yeah. Um, I thought you
were gonna go to bed?

18:44.177 --> 18:46.921
Oh no, I was, but then
Tammy kept buying shots,

18:46.946 --> 18:49.815
and the whole room got behind
me in like, a really big way.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.674
Anyway, I have seven
more songs to finish,

18:51.699 --> 18:53.377
and some new fans who
would be very disappointed

18:53.402 --> 18:55.036
if I don't close the show.

18:55.061 --> 18:58.090
- Oh, Dana! Or is it David?
- Huh?

18:58.115 --> 19:00.060
Listen, I just wanted you
to know that Stevie told me

19:00.084 --> 19:01.011
what you did for her tonight.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.214
You know, giving up your evening,

19:02.239 --> 19:03.370
so that we could have
some time together.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.296
Anyway, it was really
cool of you to do it,

19:05.321 --> 19:07.347
is what I'm saying, and
not just because um...

19:07.372 --> 19:09.050
we get to have a little
sleepover because of it.

19:11.035 --> 19:13.336
So to say thank you, I took
care of your room charges.

19:13.797 --> 19:16.237
Oh my God! Hello!

19:16.262 --> 19:18.601
Um, hi! Can I get another drink then,

19:18.626 --> 19:19.893
to the room, please? Thanks!

19:19.918 --> 19:21.819
I actually just meant
like, your mini-bar.

19:21.844 --> 19:24.212
Oh no, I finished that. Hey, Tam!

19:24.237 --> 19:25.905
You want some zhampagne?!

19:25.930 --> 19:27.564
Yeah, two please, drinks.

19:27.956 --> 19:30.079
Okay, um... what do
you say we get up there,

19:30.104 --> 19:32.416
maybe do a little duet? I feel
like that's the kind of thing

19:32.441 --> 19:34.259
you'd be totally
comfortable with, right?

19:34.284 --> 19:35.618
- Mhmm...
- Yeah, love that.

19:35.719 --> 19:37.697
I think it's best if you guys
just sat down, and watched.

19:37.721 --> 19:39.097
- Oh, okay.
- Next time.

19:39.122 --> 19:40.198
- Yeah. Mhmm.
- Off the hook for now.

19:40.223 --> 19:42.534
Uno, Tammy! I think I'm going
to do this one by myself.

19:42.574 --> 19:43.597
- Oh!
- Thank you so much, though.

19:43.622 --> 19:45.022
- We'll call you back.
- Wow.

19:45.047 --> 19:47.214
See you soon. I would like
to dedicate this one...

19:47.239 --> 19:49.890
to the lovers right over there!

19:49.915 --> 19:51.149
- Okay...
- And, goodnight.

19:51.174 --> 19:53.767
David: The
la-la-lovers... Cue it up!

19:58.160 --> 19:59.827
Okay, are you coming out?

19:59.928 --> 20:01.206
Can you stop yelling, please?!

20:01.230 --> 20:03.331
I had 14 polar bear shots last night.

20:03.356 --> 20:05.824
Moira, do you want us to close our eyes?

20:13.217 --> 20:15.351
Oh my God.

20:16.644 --> 20:20.151
Moira, it's gorgeous.

20:21.189 --> 20:22.860
Wasn't it shown with a veil?

20:22.885 --> 20:24.452
Oh, the veil's on its way.

20:24.477 --> 20:27.346
Well, now that I see
it on you, I understand!

20:27.675 --> 20:29.366
I feel like I'm waiting for the limo

20:29.391 --> 20:32.126
to take us to your
next red carpet event!

20:32.789 --> 20:34.590
Well, sweetheart, if that's...

20:34.956 --> 20:36.987
if that's the dress
you want, then, uh...

20:37.012 --> 20:39.894
It is. But you're right,
John, it's not the time.

20:39.919 --> 20:43.472
So before I send her back,
take a mental picture.

20:48.162 --> 20:51.221
And perhaps an actual picture as well?

20:51.246 --> 20:53.581
- Anyone have a camera?
- Oh.

20:53.606 --> 20:55.607
- Yes, yes.
- Oh yes.

20:55.784 --> 20:57.980
- Gimme like, a mm!
- Mm!

20:58.005 --> 20:59.797
Like, arm.

20:59.822 --> 21:01.620
- Oh!
- Okay.

21:01.645 --> 21:03.379
Yeah, got it?

21:04.335 --> 21:05.702
Okay, that's it.

21:05.727 --> 21:09.006
And if all goes to plan, we'll
meet again on the red carpet.

21:09.183 --> 21:11.518
Ideally, sometime this year.

21:11.543 --> 21:13.243
And those are the
shoes we're going with?

21:13.268 --> 21:15.269
- What do you think?
- No.

21:15.294 --> 21:17.748
Shoes, later. As well as jewels.

21:17.773 --> 21:19.874
What?!
