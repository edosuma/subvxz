00:01.101 --> 00:02.864
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:02.969 --> 00:04.596
<i>Tool Time!</i>

00:04.671 --> 00:08.937
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.136
[cheering]

00:15.915 --> 00:17.212
Thank you.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.411
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Heidi.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.853
Nice crisp autumn afternoon.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.856
Thank you.
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

00:24.924 --> 00:28.155
And you all know my assistant,
Al ''Autumn Boy'' Borland.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.253
[cheering]

00:33.900 --> 00:36.801
<i>Well, continuing wall treatment week
here on Tool Time,</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.566
Al and l are doing
our salute to wallpaper...

00:39.639 --> 00:40.799
[ripping sound]

00:40.907 --> 00:42.204
...removal.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.710
How you get rid of your wallpaper
depends on what kind you have.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.373
Now, strippable wallpaper
is the easiest to remove.

00:49.482 --> 00:53.316
Al's gonna strip now, so those of you
with weaker stomachs look away.

00:54.921 --> 00:58.482
You simply pry up a corner
and pull down in a...

00:58.558 --> 01:00.389
Whoa!

01:02.495 --> 01:05.794
Oh. By the way, Happy Halloween, Al.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.933
That was not funny.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.734
Well, apparently the audience laughed
for no reason.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.540
There's other ways to remove wallpaper.

01:18.611 --> 01:22.377
That's right. Electrical steamers,
chemical stripping solutions...

01:22.449 --> 01:25.976
Or my favorite. Just tear the house down
and start all over again.

01:26.052 --> 01:31.115
For the chemical method you use a simple
garden sprayer and scoring tool.

01:31.191 --> 01:34.456
- Tim, would you like to do the honors?
- Yes, l would.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.255
OK.

01:37.330 --> 01:41.699
Right here you start. You want to score
the wallpaper in a crisscross fashion.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.962
Like this. All right?

01:46.206 --> 01:49.107
Take your chemical sprayer,
filled with stripping compound

01:49.175 --> 01:50.733
and soak the wallpaper.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.301
Like this...
[straining]

01:55.915 --> 01:59.783
- There's no pressure in there, Al.
- There is. l checked this morning.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.686
You ask a guy to do a job...

02:09.996 --> 02:12.123
[laughing]

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.708 --> 02:23.642
You are the master, Al.

02:24.711 --> 02:28.977
You know, Al, if you're gonna scare
The Tool Man you gotta do a better job.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.481
[yelling]

03:24.671 --> 03:28.402
- [Randy] l don't know. We'll see.
- [Brad laughing]

03:28.474 --> 03:30.305
OK, guys, what do you want for dinner?

03:30.376 --> 03:33.675
Actually, Brad and l were gonna
take care of that tonight.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.373
Wait a minute.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.879
My sons are volunteering to cook dinner?

03:38.985 --> 03:41.351
We've already got something
in the microwave.

03:41.421 --> 03:44.288
- Vegetarian lasagna.
- Oh!

03:44.357 --> 03:47.884
You're not only cooking it,
you're cooking something healthy?

03:50.630 --> 03:54.361
We haven't started it yet. Why don't you
see if we put enough cheese on it?

03:54.434 --> 03:57.699
Sure. You're so beautiful.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.705
l love you.
[gasping]

04:00.773 --> 04:02.832
l hate you!

04:02.909 --> 04:06.140
- Gotcha.
- l hate when you scare me like that.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.305
And yet, we love it.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.878
[Tim humming]

04:24.864 --> 04:27.833
Well, you've burst the skull
again, honey.

04:29.802 --> 04:34.239
You're supposed to poke holes
in a severed head before you nuke it.

04:40.313 --> 04:44.215
Brad and Randy nearly gave me a heart
attack with that disgusting thing.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.576
They didn't wait for me?

04:47.654 --> 04:49.212
Tim, this isn't funny.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.122
They put a rubber tarantula
in Mark's underwear,

04:52.191 --> 04:54.921
and pumped slime through every slat
in Wilson's fence.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.361
- They didn't wait for me?
- What are we gonna do about them?

04:59.198 --> 05:03.464
Well, what any good parents would do.
Scare the daylights out of them.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.432
''An eye for an eye'' is not my idea
of good parenting.

05:07.507 --> 05:10.203
l know this is your area
and you're the expert here,

05:10.276 --> 05:15.043
but let me explain a little about
the psychology of Halloween.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.514
This should be good.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.278
Just go with me for a minute.

05:19.952 --> 05:23.718
When a child puts a severed head,
real or otherwise, in an oven,

05:24.924 --> 05:26.755
they're not doing that to scare you.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.989
They're doing that to reach out.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.062
They're saying,
''Mom and Dad, l love you.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.295
- Please, please, scare me.''
- [laughing]

05:39.939 --> 05:43.670
lt would really mean a lot to you
if l went along with this, wouldn't it?

05:43.743 --> 05:45.870
lt's not for me.
lt's for the children.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.047
[doorbell rings]

06:00.393 --> 06:02.452
- Can l help you?
- l hope so.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.462
My name is Clifford Warren.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.861
[thunderclap]

06:08.735 --> 06:12.762
l'm in town for a funeral
at the Pleasant Lake Mortuary.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.364
Lovely facility.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.443
You need directions or something?

06:18.511 --> 06:22.470
l was on my way and l just happened
to pass by my old house

06:22.548 --> 06:26.644
and l was wondering if l could just
stop in and take a look at the place.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.154
You used to live here or something?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.384
Oh, yes, with my brother,

06:32.458 --> 06:36.019
until the, uh...
Well, you know.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.620
- What?
- The incident!

06:42.402 --> 06:43.630
What incident?

06:43.703 --> 06:46.069
[Tim] Guys, what do you think
of my chicken?

06:46.172 --> 06:49.232
- [Randy] Yah!
- [Jill] We're thinking of wearing...

06:51.911 --> 06:55.870
- Who are you?
- l'm Clifford Warren.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.711
[thunderclap]

07:00.186 --> 07:02.347
He was just about to tell us
about some incident

07:02.422 --> 07:05.448
- that happened when he lived here.
- No incident happened here.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.187
This is a normal American home
with normal Americans.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.626
Whatever you say.

07:10.163 --> 07:15.396
Yes, does that crazy man Wilson
still live next door?

07:15.468 --> 07:17.902
[Tim] We don't know.
We don't talk to our neighbors.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.406
l think it's about time you left,
Mr. Clifford whatever.

07:21.474 --> 07:25.433
Uh, before l go could l please
take a look at the basement?

07:26.145 --> 07:28.204
The basement?
That's my room.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.441
Oh.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.278
l am sorry.

07:32.685 --> 07:37.122
Well, Clifford, it was nice to meet you.
l'm sure you have other things to do.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.283
You might try getting some sun!

07:42.161 --> 07:43.594
Geez, what was that about?

07:45.064 --> 07:47.089
lt was 25 years ago.
lt's no big deal.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.059
Why did Clifford want to see
the basement?

07:51.137 --> 07:54.231
He probably wanted to take a look
at the new furnace l put in.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.732
That was weird.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.334
What do you think that was about?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.573
Randy, Randy, Randy, don't you get it?

08:01.681 --> 08:03.512
Of course l get it.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.016
What have l got?

08:05.918 --> 08:07.442
We put the head in the microwave

08:07.520 --> 08:10.182
so Mom and Dad thought of something
to get us back with.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.918
l don't know.
Clifford seemed pretty believable.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.823
l've got to admit he was pretty real.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.862
But l still think this is
a total set-up.

08:16.963 --> 08:20.262
Easy for you to say. You're not the one
sleeping in the basement.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.499
The guy said he knew Wilson.
Let's talk to Wilson.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.299
lf Wilson says he's never heard of him
we know it's a scam.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.806
lf it isn't l'm switching rooms
with Mark.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.174
- [Tim] Come on in, Larry.
- How did l do?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.184
You gave me the creeps
and l thought the story up.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.684
Me, too. l don't know whether to write
the check to Clifford or Larry.

08:44.757 --> 08:47.726
Oh, make it out
to my other name, ''cash''.

08:49.228 --> 08:51.560
- Hey, you must be Mark, right?
- Yes.

08:51.631 --> 08:54.794
Yeah, l heard about the arachnid
in your unmentionables.

08:55.968 --> 08:58.436
Don't worry.
We're gonna get your brothers good.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.995
- Cool.
- All right. Professional opinion.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.836
- OK.
- How do you like my costume?

09:02.909 --> 09:05.275
Well, professionally,
it's kind of cheesy.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.846
- Cheesy?
- But cheesy is in this year.

09:09.916 --> 09:13.010
l'll tell you what.
l got cheesier stuff out in the van.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.646
l'll bring some clothes in, try them on
and take back what you don't use.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.122
- What a guy, what a guy. Yeah.
- OK.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.954
- [Jill] Thanks.
- Thank you.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.528
Hey. Cool fake mucus.

09:23.596 --> 09:27.157
Oh. Actually, uh, l'm fighting a cold.

09:33.706 --> 09:37.403
[Wilson] Head of monkey, brain of cat,

09:37.476 --> 09:41.640
eye of weasel, tail of rat,

09:41.714 --> 09:44.877
juice of mugwort, mastic, myrrh,

09:44.984 --> 09:48.283
all within the pot l stir.

09:50.222 --> 09:51.746
What's that smell?

09:51.824 --> 09:53.849
l'm making a mugwort-based witch's brew.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.450
You boys want a slug?

09:55.528 --> 09:58.429
No, thanks. l'm trying to cut back
on my mugwort.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.067
lf you boys are here to help me
clean my fence you're a bit late.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.601
Sorry we slimed you, Wilson.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.830
Oh, fortunately,
it was a water-based slime.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.395
lt hosed right off.

10:09.342 --> 10:14.575
Um, listen, have you by chance ever
heard of a guy named Clifford Warren?

10:14.647 --> 10:15.978
[spooky music]

10:20.786 --> 10:22.151
Clifford Warren?

10:22.788 --> 10:26.451
- Who wants to know?
- You're saying you've heard of him?

10:26.525 --> 10:28.083
Unfortunately, l have.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.924
Well, then, you know all about the...

10:32.531 --> 10:34.192
[Wilson] The incident.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.760
Yes, your parents finally told you.

10:37.837 --> 10:41.068
Yeah, they told us everything
about the incident.

10:41.674 --> 10:46.441
Horrible thing, that incident.
One of the worst incidents of all time.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.077
For years that night has haunted me.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.117
The night that Clifford came home
on Halloween

10:55.187 --> 10:58.452
and discovered that his brother Ezekiel
was missing.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.525
And l don't think
we'll ever know for sure

11:03.295 --> 11:05.820
whether Ezekiel ran away

11:06.365 --> 11:09.129
or Clifford murdered him.

11:10.036 --> 11:12.504
- Murdered him?
- You did know about that, Randy?

11:12.571 --> 11:16.200
No, of course l did. lt's just every
time l hear it, it's so shocking.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.607
Clifford swore that he was innocent,

11:18.678 --> 11:21.647
but he was so appalled
at the accusations

11:21.747 --> 11:23.715
that he actually went insane.

11:23.816 --> 11:28.116
And now he's locked up
in a mental institution for life.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.779
[spooky music]

11:35.327 --> 11:37.420
- Clifford's out.
- He stopped by our house.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.623
He wanted to see our basement.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.759
Randy, Randy, isn't your bedroom
in the basement?

11:43.636 --> 11:47.572
- This is way too weird.
- That's what people said at the time.

11:48.007 --> 11:51.636
Would you boys like to see a newspaper
clipping l saved about the incident?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.179
- Yeah.
- Go on in the house.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.140
l'll just put the cauldron on simmer.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.080
Needs more monkey head.

12:15.267 --> 12:18.293
- This is Clifford.
- This is his brother, Ezekiel.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.928
The one he murdered.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.404
Yeah, right.

12:22.308 --> 12:23.832
Mark, you gotta believe me.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.934
The body might be buried
in the basement.

12:26.011 --> 12:28.241
By the way, do you want to switch rooms?

12:29.715 --> 12:32.445
Forget it.
You guys are just trying to scare me.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.244
- [doorbell rings]
- l got it!

12:35.955 --> 12:37.718
- No, don't get the door.
- Don't get it!

12:37.823 --> 12:39.313
[both screaming]

12:41.327 --> 12:44.455
- lt's just Al.
- Hey, guys. Happy Halloween.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.520
Good one.
[chuckling]

12:47.066 --> 12:50.194
So, anyway, l stopped by
to pick up my head.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.170
- Yeah, it's on the kitchen counter.
- All right. Great.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.207
OK. You know we're gonna be using this

12:55.307 --> 12:57.468
for our annual marathon scare-a-thon.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.009
Whooooo!

12:59.979 --> 13:04.211
Eileen's going to take out the cranium
and put in melon balls.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.119
Hey, look,
there's an old picture of Larry.

13:09.188 --> 13:10.553
Who's Larry?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.716
That's your dad's Halloween guy.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.953
No, that's Clifford Warren.

13:15.060 --> 13:19.520
<i>That wasn't what he was calling himself
when your dad brought him by Tool Time.</i>

13:21.600 --> 13:23.830
l cannot believe we just fell for this.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.666
- We're idiots.
- lt was all set up.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.603
And we're idiots.

13:28.707 --> 13:33.235
Oh, l feel like l just messed up
a little Halloween prank.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.540
Just a teeny one.

13:34.613 --> 13:38.947
Mom and Dad wanted us to think there was
a homicidal maniac trying to get us.

13:40.352 --> 13:43.185
[chuckling]
That's a good one.

13:44.423 --> 13:47.392
Now we gotta think of something
just as good to get back at them.

13:47.493 --> 13:51.554
Well, you're Tim's sons. l'm sure
you inherited the torture chromosome.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.558
Bye-bye.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.825
- Hey, Al.
- Yeah?

13:56.902 --> 13:59.769
How would you like to help us
do this prank on our parents?

14:02.575 --> 14:05.738
Well, l wouldn't feel so bad
about scaring your dad again,

14:05.811 --> 14:08.746
but no, l wouldn't feel right
scaring your mom.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.945
Really?
Even after what she said about you?

14:14.720 --> 14:17.211
What did she say about me?

14:18.257 --> 14:22.159
Oh, l believe she referred
to your little Halloween party

14:22.228 --> 14:25.197
as ''the marathon yawn-a-thon''.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.425
Jill said that?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.297
- That's what l heard. You, Brad?
- l heard her say that.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.337
She also said your mom
doesn't bob for apples.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.339
She bobs for ham hocks.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.511
l'm in!

14:46.552 --> 14:48.577
- [Randy] All right.
- [Brad] Yeah!

14:51.390 --> 14:54.154
Tim? Jill? You better get downstairs.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.890
[Al] Whoa.

14:58.264 --> 15:01.165
- What are you doing here?
- l came to pick up my head.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.534
- What's the matter?
- Well, it-it's Randy.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.299
He's really scared.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.635
All right!

15:08.707 --> 15:12.473
He keeps babbling something about
a murderer coming to get him.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.342
- All right!
- l knew this was a bad idea.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.244
lt's stupid to scare your own kid.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.247
That woman misses the whole point
about Halloween.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.222
Wait a minute.
Randy's really scared.

15:25.291 --> 15:28.522
He-he's talking about wanting
to come over to my house.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.154
- Are you serious?
- Would l lie to you?

15:36.235 --> 15:38.965
- Oh, ow!
- All right, they look like real tears.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.268
They are. You just poked me in the eye.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.239
Randy, honey.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.571
Honey, everything is OK.

15:47.379 --> 15:51.543
l don't know, Mom. He's really scared
about this Clifford guy.

15:54.353 --> 15:57.254
- What are you crying about?
- l'm not staying here.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.814
Clifford's gonna come back.
He'll kill all of us.

15:59.892 --> 16:04.522
Honey, he's not. This was just a stupid
joke we played on you to scare you.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.655
l didn't want to,
but your mom wanted to.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.634
- You guys really made this up?
- No! l mean, yes.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.069
He did. Look, look, l swear.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.904
lt is just a big mistake.
l am so sorry, sweetheart.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.534
- lt's all over.
- Not unless you're just saying this

16:19.611 --> 16:21.442
so we won't be scared of Clifford.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.175
l want to go home with Al
where it's safe.

16:24.249 --> 16:28.310
Come on, Randy. You heard your parents.
There is no such person as Larry.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.117
Yeah, come on. Listen to Al.
There's no such...

16:33.759 --> 16:36.660
Larry?
You mean, as in like ''Halloween Larry''?

16:37.463 --> 16:40.694
No, as in Clifford,
Clifford the murderer!

16:42.801 --> 16:44.098
Halloween guy? Murderer?

16:44.169 --> 16:46.933
What difference does it make?
l'm really scared.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.441
The difference is,
Al just blew your stupid little joke.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.173
But we almost had you!

16:57.249 --> 17:00.548
We did, didn't we?
We got you guys!

17:00.619 --> 17:01.881
We didn't, we're all...

17:01.954 --> 17:04.888
Man, l'm a Halloween washout.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.050
l'm a third-rate prankster.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.888
Don't flatter yourself.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.053
Listen, we'll just call a truce.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.156
- We all had our fun.
- Not as much fun as we had.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.598
Well, how's that?

17:15.701 --> 17:19.228
Well, scaring your kids is easy,
but scaring your parents is huge.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.507
l'll never forget the look
on your face.

17:22.574 --> 17:25.667
''lt's OK, sweetheart,
it was just a joke. We made it all up.''

17:28.513 --> 17:31.449
OK, Mark should be back
from Brian's party around 1 0:00.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.485
We'll call you when we're leaving Al's.

17:33.585 --> 17:34.950
We might be kind of late

17:35.054 --> 17:38.285
'cause l'm thinking
of raising a little bit of hell.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.751
You sure you'll be OK by yourselves?

17:42.828 --> 17:45.456
[mocking] l don't know, Mommy.
What if l get scared?

17:45.531 --> 17:47.897
Yeah, what if the murderer
comes to get us?

17:48.467 --> 17:51.027
Tell him not to make a mess.

17:53.839 --> 17:56.706
Right. One candy bar for the spaceman.

17:56.775 --> 17:59.869
And seven for the cute little lion cub.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.107
[doorbell rings]

18:07.653 --> 18:09.985
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.956
Great costume. Brad, look,
it's our old friend, Clifford.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.959
Mind if l come in?
lt's starting to rain.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.688
Yeah, come on in...

18:16.762 --> 18:17.854
...Larry.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.831
[chuckling] Coming in to look
for your brother's dead body?

18:20.899 --> 18:23.925
- Ooh, scary.
- Your parents shortchanged me.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.232
l want the rest of my money.
Where are they?

18:26.305 --> 18:29.741
They're at Al's party, but we'll
tell them and they'll get back to you.

18:29.808 --> 18:31.275
Oh, sure.
Yeah, right.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.311
l want my hundred bucks now.

18:36.448 --> 18:40.384
- Well, we don't have it.
- Yeah, see.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.080
Everybody thinks they can kick me around

18:43.155 --> 18:46.181
just because l'm the ''Halloween guy''.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.553
Well, Halloween guys have got feelings,
you know?

18:50.629 --> 18:55.396
Right now, l don't know, this
Halloween guy's feeling kind of angry.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.764
You know what might
make you feel better?

18:59.838 --> 19:01.203
A granola bar.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.507
Cash.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.038
Well, we don't have it.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.705
OK, OK, um...

19:09.781 --> 19:13.012
Don't Mom and Dad keep some money
for emergencies in the house?

19:13.085 --> 19:17.647
Sir, l believe it's up in the attic,
so we'll go get it right now.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.853
[chuckling]

19:28.534 --> 19:30.161
You remember where it's hidden?

19:30.235 --> 19:32.999
Yeah, l think it's in one of Dad's
old cigar boxes.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.297
[coughing]

19:35.374 --> 19:38.070
[Randy] Man, what is this stuff?
l can't see a thing.

19:38.143 --> 19:39.838
- l don't know.
- [thunderclap]

19:40.312 --> 19:42.143
Maybe Dad left the window open

19:42.214 --> 19:44.944
and the warm air and cold air mixed
and made fog.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.043
Wow. l just remembered something
from Earth Science!

19:50.556 --> 19:51.989
Hey, yes!

19:52.057 --> 19:53.957
- l found the cigar box.
- Yes.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.493
[screaming]
Rats!

19:55.561 --> 19:56.926
[squeaking]

19:57.029 --> 19:58.656
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold on.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.561
l see another cigar box over here.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.495
[creaking]

20:06.138 --> 20:09.073
Which l don't think we need to explore
at this point.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.973
[Tim] Hey, boys, is that you?

20:12.778 --> 20:15.269
Dad? Mom?

20:16.481 --> 20:18.540
- [spooky laughter]
- [screaming]

20:19.318 --> 20:21.548
[screaming]

20:24.289 --> 20:28.350
You know, if l'm not mistaken,
l think Daddy's scared his little boys.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.857
We got you good.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.199
Happy Halloween.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.239
Thanks a lot, Larry.
Come on up here.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.241
Listen, l gotta congratulate you people.

20:44.309 --> 20:48.473
l mean, in all my years l have never
seen a family go to such sick lengths

20:48.580 --> 20:50.480
to torture each other on Halloween.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.818
- You should see us at Christmas.
- Yeah!

20:56.321 --> 20:56.488
- Why don't we go to Al's party?
- No reason why we can't all go.

20:56.521 --> 20:59.252
- Why don't we go to Al's party?
- No reason why we can't all go.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.723
Great.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.888
That might be a reason.

21:03.962 --> 21:07.921
- Come on, Dad, the joke's over.
- l didn't do this. Larry, did you?

21:08.033 --> 21:09.864
Wish l had. lt's a nice touch.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.402
lt's shut. We're locked in.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.701
No worries. l'm the Tool Man.
l'll get it open.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.240
[pounding]

21:17.209 --> 21:19.541
[Wilson] How long you gonna
leave them up there?

21:19.611 --> 21:21.101
Long enough to let them know

21:21.179 --> 21:24.114
that Al Borland can prank
with the best of them.

21:24.182 --> 21:25.342
[chuckling]

21:25.450 --> 21:26.610
Actually, you know,

21:26.718 --> 21:30.154
maybe l should let them down now
before Tim does something stupid.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.190
[pounding]

21:48.840 --> 21:51.900
- [woman] There we go.
- Don't wipe him off.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.104
Don't wipe him off.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.272
- [Jill] We like it.
- [Randy] Stop it.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.713
ln five.

21:59.017 --> 22:02.077
- [beeping]
- But we almost had you, huh?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.314
We almost had...

22:03.388 --> 22:06.516
Oh, l'm a Hollywood wash...

22:09.795 --> 22:12.161
- Well, you're that too.
- You're that too.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.494
l'm a Halloween...
