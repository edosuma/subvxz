<i>And so Duckburg is saved,</i>

00:20.429 --> 00:23.719
<i>thanks to Scrooge McDuck and his family!</i>

00:30.313 --> 00:32.726
Uh! Can't stop. So close.

00:32.860 --> 00:36.766
Treacherous spy.
What are you really up to?

00:57.830 --> 00:59.829
- Uncle Donald!
- Donald!

01:00.111 --> 01:01.233
Wak! Ohhh!

01:01.321 --> 01:03.391
Careful!
This was expensive.

01:03.479 --> 01:04.992
A prescription hammock?

01:05.110 --> 01:07.225
"For molting
relating to stress."

01:07.312 --> 01:08.493
Whoa!

01:09.402 --> 01:10.508
Oof!

01:10.596 --> 01:12.144
Doctor's orders.

01:12.232 --> 01:14.480
That's ridiculous.
You're not molting!

01:14.568 --> 01:17.211
Look at that luscious head
full of... Ooh!

01:17.299 --> 01:19.436
Ooh, that's
a lot of feathers.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.040
Anyway, we need to borrow
your old VCR

01:22.127 --> 01:24.742
so we can watch this copy
of the "Necronomicassette,"

01:24.829 --> 01:27.935
the VHS that raises the dead,
the most horrifying...

01:28.023 --> 01:30.333
B horror movie
from the nineties!

01:30.421 --> 01:32.013
We'll take care of it.
No need to worry.

01:32.101 --> 01:33.718
Read your book, relax.
Everything's fine...

01:33.805 --> 01:35.587
If we don't become zombies!

01:35.674 --> 01:38.223
From too much time in
front of the ol' boob tube!

01:38.310 --> 01:39.983
Ha! 'Kay, bye!

01:41.499 --> 01:43.655
Everything's fine.

01:56.179 --> 01:57.712
Waak!

01:59.790 --> 02:00.956

03:09.502 --> 03:10.762
I do wish you would
take up

03:10.850 --> 03:12.066
our offer
to stay with us here.

03:12.154 --> 03:14.418
It would be the perfect
place to work on your ship.

03:14.506 --> 03:15.730
No, thanks.

03:15.801 --> 03:17.315
The only person
I ever managed to bunk with

03:17.402 --> 03:19.705
was my brother,
and we fought constantly.

03:19.793 --> 03:21.770
Well, it's better than
sleeping out in the wastes.

03:21.907 --> 03:23.035
Oh, I'm not sleeping.

03:23.123 --> 03:25.416
I am this close
to patching up my ship

03:25.504 --> 03:26.830
and getting home
to my family.

03:26.918 --> 03:30.729
I just need
a little... more... gold.

03:31.012 --> 03:32.246
Whoa!

03:32.441 --> 03:33.736
Is that Penny?

03:33.824 --> 03:35.996
Penumbra was
our greatest warrior.

03:36.113 --> 03:37.791
Together
we held the mites at bay.

03:37.879 --> 03:40.439
She is a hero
of the Planet Moon.

03:40.526 --> 03:42.674
Which is technically
not a planet, so... Moon Moon?

03:42.815 --> 03:44.715
Planet Moon!

03:46.465 --> 03:48.180
- Oh, hi, Penny.
- Penumbra!

03:48.267 --> 03:51.183
Oh, is it Moon custom to yell?
Howdy, Penny!

03:51.270 --> 03:52.451
Forgive Penumbra.

03:52.538 --> 03:54.110
Since the mites
stopped attacking,

03:54.198 --> 03:57.305
she is a warrior
with no war to fight.

03:57.393 --> 04:00.188
Look who's got
an extended vacay, huh?

04:00.276 --> 04:01.391
What are you gonna do now?

04:01.479 --> 04:03.225
- Oof!
- Seethe.

04:03.682 --> 04:05.377
Sounds fun!

04:05.487 --> 04:06.795
I better get back to work.

04:06.882 --> 04:08.864
The Spear of Selene's
not gonna rebuild itself.

04:08.951 --> 04:11.133
Yes, go back to
your mysterious project!

04:11.220 --> 04:13.535
I am definitely not suspicious
of you!

04:13.622 --> 04:15.504
She's a liar.
Let's blast her.

04:15.591 --> 04:19.474
Ha. I think I spy the
green-eyed monster of jealousy.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.052
I'm not jealous.

04:21.139 --> 04:23.020
She's trying to convince
you all she's your friend

04:23.107 --> 04:25.147
to distract
from some devious attack!

04:25.234 --> 04:27.404
Penumbra, come with me.

04:30.439 --> 04:32.054
See that rock?

04:32.141 --> 04:35.357
My father, General Meridian,
was terrified of it.

04:35.444 --> 04:37.993
Claimed to have seen mysterious
objects launched off it.

04:38.142 --> 04:41.663
He was so afraid that he drove
us into hiding underground,

04:41.750 --> 04:45.025
which allowed the mites to become
a problem in the first place.

04:45.353 --> 04:49.438
Does Della look
like a threat to you?

04:49.525 --> 04:51.999
No. She is squishy
and easily defeatable

04:52.087 --> 04:53.675
if you would just let me.

04:53.762 --> 04:56.570
I will not spend my life
in fear of them, Penumbra.

04:56.658 --> 04:58.347
Our people will see
that in time.

04:58.434 --> 04:59.470
So will you.

04:59.558 --> 05:01.242
I tell you,
she will not rest

05:01.330 --> 05:03.226
until she wreaks havoc
on our planet.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.624
Ah. Poor thing.

05:08.711 --> 05:11.117
Penumbra,
she's staying with you.

05:11.205 --> 05:12.946
That's an order.

05:14.263 --> 05:15.410
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

05:16.952 --> 05:18.968
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

05:19.056 --> 05:20.068
Aaah!

05:20.155 --> 05:22.009
Yaah! Unh!

05:29.531 --> 05:30.861
Ohh!

05:32.988 --> 05:34.345
Ha ha!

05:35.323 --> 05:36.389
Huh?!

05:38.140 --> 05:41.142
Aaah ha ha!

05:41.267 --> 05:44.556
"Quacktu baraduck Necktie!"

05:48.650 --> 05:49.714
All right!

05:54.490 --> 05:56.015
- That was awesome!
- Whoo-hoo!

05:56.103 --> 05:57.320
We're alive!

05:58.594 --> 06:02.304
See? I told you
everything was fine.

06:02.392 --> 06:04.275
Get back to rest.

06:04.367 --> 06:07.392
Everything's... fine.

06:27.022 --> 06:28.928
Ahh!

06:33.901 --> 06:36.038
Guess who's a God now?!

06:37.046 --> 06:39.530
Huh? Huh?!

06:41.523 --> 06:42.937
Waak! Oh, no.

06:43.071 --> 06:45.325
Intrepid Dewey bravely seized

06:45.413 --> 06:47.289
the Sandals of Hermes
from my chest

06:47.376 --> 06:49.950
and is now
messenger of the Gods!

06:51.547 --> 06:53.192
Father
is most displeased.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.629
Um, he's just jealous

06:54.716 --> 06:57.499
'cause I'm the youngest
Deweity on the block!

07:01.147 --> 07:02.904
Father has declared war
on Dewey Duck.

07:02.991 --> 07:04.098
What?!

07:04.186 --> 07:05.507
Ohh ohhh!

07:06.046 --> 07:08.009
Yeesh. Don't worry,
Uncle Donald.

07:08.096 --> 07:09.845
You just rest.
We totally got this!

07:09.932 --> 07:10.912
Ha ha!

07:10.999 --> 07:13.882
Ow, the lightning burns!

07:13.969 --> 07:15.402
Ohh!

07:20.976 --> 07:22.758
Hey, roomie!

07:22.845 --> 07:24.077
Whoo! Hey, careful,

07:24.165 --> 07:25.320
you don't want to burn
down your garage.

07:25.407 --> 07:27.755
Sorry, our garage!

07:27.862 --> 07:30.700
Lunaris told me you so generously
volunteered to put me up.

07:30.788 --> 07:32.200
I was like,
"Well, I can't say no

07:32.288 --> 07:33.639
to my new best friend, right?"

07:33.764 --> 07:37.272
Look at us, strangers
from different worlds,

07:37.493 --> 07:38.673
forced to be roommates.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.022
We're a classic odd couple.

07:41.181 --> 07:42.717
I don't know what that is.

07:42.805 --> 07:45.221
Ha ha! Thanks for letting me
stay at your pad, Penny.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.264
Lieutenant. Penumbra.

07:47.436 --> 07:49.518
Aw, look at
your cute little spear.

07:49.605 --> 07:51.928
That was my Childhood
Training Spear.

07:52.016 --> 07:55.436
I used it to defend my home
from unwanted pests.

07:55.553 --> 07:56.758
Oh! Speaking of spears,

07:56.845 --> 07:58.005
I better get back
to working on mine.

07:58.092 --> 08:00.228
Hey!
We both have spears.

08:00.315 --> 08:01.296
That's neat!

08:01.383 --> 08:02.297
No, it isn't.

08:02.384 --> 08:03.598
Yes, it is!

08:03.686 --> 08:04.900
No, it isn't!

08:04.987 --> 08:06.201
Yes, it is!

08:06.288 --> 08:07.694
Nooo!

08:11.879 --> 08:13.085
Hup!

08:17.065 --> 08:18.480
Treacherous imposter.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.649
No one is falling
for your Earth ways.

08:20.736 --> 08:22.176
You're the stranger...

08:22.264 --> 08:23.544
That saved us
with your Earth ways!

08:23.631 --> 08:24.928
Hey, Zenith!

08:25.053 --> 08:27.422
A true hero
living right next door.

08:27.509 --> 08:29.624
Count my lucky stars.

08:30.053 --> 08:33.639
I heard you beat the mite
with com-pa-ssion.

08:33.772 --> 08:36.565
Is that some fancy
Earth fighting technique?

08:36.741 --> 08:38.215
No, no. I'm just a mom

08:38.303 --> 08:39.967
trying to get home
to see her kids.

08:40.056 --> 08:41.749
You gave us so much.

08:41.913 --> 08:44.406
We would be honored
to help you in any way.

08:44.493 --> 08:46.272
Really? Thanks!

08:48.397 --> 08:49.723
Has everyone gone crazy?

08:49.811 --> 08:52.294
Why are you helping her?!
Ugh!

08:53.834 --> 08:56.083
So I tied up
the Beagle Boys

08:56.171 --> 08:59.421
and strung them down from
the bank rafters like a yo-yo.

08:59.508 --> 09:01.249
That is amazing!

09:01.538 --> 09:02.656
What is a yo-yo?

09:02.744 --> 09:03.992
You do tricks with it...

09:04.079 --> 09:06.027
Around the world
and walk the dog.

09:06.202 --> 09:08.015
That is amazing!

09:08.116 --> 09:09.297
What is a dog?

09:09.384 --> 09:10.966
Dazzling them with lies

09:11.101 --> 09:13.268
about how your pitiful planet
is better than ours!

09:13.355 --> 09:15.589
Pff! Two can play
at that game.

09:16.876 --> 09:19.960
Well, look
who's coming around.

09:20.048 --> 09:22.186
Greetings... roomie.

09:23.031 --> 09:26.194
Do I see a shenanigan
in our future?

09:26.569 --> 09:29.466
Yes. Shenanigans.
Another reason Planet Moon

09:29.554 --> 09:31.848
is more fun
than your lame Earth.

09:31.936 --> 09:34.689
Aw, we can both
be great, right?

09:34.776 --> 09:36.491
The Earth, the Moon,

09:36.579 --> 09:38.171
which orbits
around the Earth.

09:38.356 --> 09:39.663
Raah!

09:43.218 --> 09:45.044
Shenanigan!

09:45.132 --> 09:46.802
Anyway, the Moon
is safe and beautiful

09:46.890 --> 09:48.818
and has everything you could
possibly want, right?

09:48.905 --> 09:50.970
I thought so,
until I learned

09:51.058 --> 09:53.888
of the wondrous "dogs"
and "yo-yos."

09:53.976 --> 09:56.184
Tell us more
about why you love it so.

09:56.272 --> 09:58.739
Well, because
my family is there.

09:58.827 --> 10:02.050
And because the Earth
has wonders large and small!

10:02.137 --> 10:05.505
The Pyramids, the humpback
whale, slap bracelets!

10:05.593 --> 10:08.038
What is
a slapping bracelets?

10:08.258 --> 10:09.657
Observe.

10:11.429 --> 10:14.195
I've never seen
anything so stylish.

10:14.282 --> 10:15.638
Um, hello?

10:15.726 --> 10:18.171
We have matching outfits
made of gold!

10:18.420 --> 10:20.186
The Earth is beautiful!

10:20.274 --> 10:23.114
When I get back, I'm gonna
show my boys every inch of it.

10:23.202 --> 10:24.638
It'll be
like I never left.

10:24.726 --> 10:26.841
We'll conquer
Mount Neverrest!

10:26.929 --> 10:29.344
Discover the Hidden Pyramid
of Toth-Ra!

10:29.431 --> 10:32.113
I'm telling you,
my family is fearless!

10:32.200 --> 10:33.882
Aaaah! Aaaah! No!

10:34.116 --> 10:35.617
Raaah!

10:35.704 --> 10:39.387
Foolish son, inviting
mortals into the pantheon!

10:39.474 --> 10:41.208
Father,
they are my friends!

10:41.296 --> 10:42.624
Please, cease your wrath!

10:42.711 --> 10:44.526
Nuh-uh! Donald out!

10:44.613 --> 10:46.388
I shall face my fellow God

10:46.476 --> 10:48.196
in a manner
befitting Olympus.

10:48.283 --> 10:51.218
Hey, Beardo! You stink!

10:51.453 --> 10:53.353
No! You do!

10:55.608 --> 10:57.088
Go! Go! Goooo!

10:57.176 --> 10:58.632
- Unh!
- Waaaak!

11:04.674 --> 11:07.041
Yaaah!

11:09.788 --> 11:11.811
Huh? She's sprung her trap!

11:13.550 --> 11:16.763
The gargantuan Gilded
Man tore through El Dorado...

11:16.851 --> 11:18.255
Oh, my craters!

11:18.350 --> 11:21.529
...annihilating everything
in its path like... Rraaah!

11:22.321 --> 11:24.083
But I looked
the bionic behemoth

11:24.171 --> 11:26.379
square in its cold,
unfeeling eyes,

11:26.467 --> 11:28.069
I climbed up
his craggy armor,

11:28.156 --> 11:30.238
burst inside, and tore
him apart from within,

11:30.325 --> 11:33.739
bringing his tyrannical,
mechanical reign to an end!

11:33.827 --> 11:34.801
- Ohh!
- Whoa-ho-ho!

11:36.264 --> 11:40.181
Oh, nothing that exciting
ever happens in Tranquility.

11:40.268 --> 11:42.247
That's why
it's called Tranquility,

11:42.335 --> 11:44.458
not Robot-Monster-Town!

11:44.546 --> 11:47.756
Ooh, is there
a Robot-Monster-Town on Earth?

11:47.843 --> 11:49.444
Not once
I'm done with it.

11:49.561 --> 11:51.259
- Aaah!
- Penumbra.

11:51.346 --> 11:54.708
Your orders were to see that
our guest has a pleasant stay.

11:54.796 --> 11:56.598
I don't think
getting speared

11:56.686 --> 11:58.538
would be very pleasant,
do you?

11:58.761 --> 12:01.410
No. Just a little?

12:01.498 --> 12:03.413
No harm is
to come to Della.

12:03.501 --> 12:05.916
But she is filling
their heads with Earth lies

12:06.004 --> 12:07.886
and making me... I mean, us.

12:07.974 --> 12:10.423
The Moon seem inferior
by comparison.

12:10.528 --> 12:12.983
She's sharing the wonders
of her culture.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.768
Like this rocket!

12:15.970 --> 12:18.386
So intricate, yet so simple.

12:18.582 --> 12:20.520
Why, all she has to do
is flip this little switch

12:20.608 --> 12:22.523
to launch
the Spear into space.

12:22.624 --> 12:23.874
Remarkable!

12:24.054 --> 12:26.476
You have to think about
the big picture, Penumbra.

12:29.732 --> 12:31.766
I'm counting this
as a win!

12:33.102 --> 12:34.142
Whoa! Oof!

12:34.230 --> 12:36.100
Oh, Aerodynamic Donald,

12:36.188 --> 12:38.944
who knew that your bold
brand of goodness

12:39.032 --> 12:40.929
could be matched
only by your...

12:41.017 --> 12:42.019
Gotta rest.

12:42.107 --> 12:44.098
Everything's fine.

12:56.099 --> 12:57.047
Waaak!

12:57.135 --> 12:58.093
What are you doing here?

12:58.180 --> 12:59.680
- Well, I... huh?!
- Nothing!

12:59.768 --> 13:01.025
Definitely not checking
your pockets

13:01.112 --> 13:02.191
for spare
million dollar bills.

13:02.278 --> 13:04.448
No, neither of you. Him.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.035
Why are you trespassing
in my togs, goat?

13:08.198 --> 13:09.704
I'm no goat.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.932
This is merely
my terrestrial form.

13:12.057 --> 13:13.041
Oh, no!

13:13.128 --> 13:14.709
And the laws of man
do not apply

13:14.796 --> 13:17.011
in the ethereal realm
of Goat'hool,

13:17.098 --> 13:20.882
a netherworld of treasures
untold and petulant orcs!

13:21.065 --> 13:24.185
Enter, nobles,
and ye shall be kings!

13:24.272 --> 13:25.844
Kings!

13:25.932 --> 13:27.071
Wha-haa!

13:27.159 --> 13:28.523
Treasure!

13:28.611 --> 13:30.844
Aww, come on!

13:36.418 --> 13:38.104
Unh! Unh!

13:38.195 --> 13:40.174
Unh!

13:44.712 --> 13:46.487
Oh, my!

13:49.164 --> 13:50.963
It's working.

13:51.088 --> 13:53.010
Thanks. All of you.

13:53.134 --> 13:56.217
I'm finally getting back
to my family on Earth!

13:56.304 --> 13:57.385
Hooray!

13:57.472 --> 14:00.822
Earth! Earth! Earth! Earth!

14:00.909 --> 14:03.071
If you all think Earth
is so great,

14:03.159 --> 14:04.711
why don't you
just go already?!

14:05.981 --> 14:07.929
Can we please go with you?

14:08.073 --> 14:10.002
Ooh! We could get
our very own dog.

14:10.090 --> 14:13.173
Ooh, and dress it
in slap bracelets!

14:15.494 --> 14:17.727
I wish I could take
all of you,

14:17.815 --> 14:19.741
but the Spear is too small.

14:19.828 --> 14:21.643
There's no way
you'd all fit.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.077
Awwwww!

14:23.164 --> 14:25.947
But the great hero
can do anything.

14:26.034 --> 14:28.249
Surely she could do it
if she wanted to.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.722
Was it something I did?

14:31.917 --> 14:33.254
Was it something
you did?

14:33.341 --> 14:36.737
Are you embarrassed
by our primitive Moon ways?

14:36.845 --> 14:39.493
No! I really wish
I could take you,

14:39.581 --> 14:41.196
but it's just not possible.

14:41.283 --> 14:42.836
I thought nothing
could stop

14:42.924 --> 14:44.799
the amazing Della Duck.

14:44.886 --> 14:47.571
Too bad. A failure,
a liar, and she snores.

14:47.659 --> 14:49.680
How could she?

14:49.768 --> 14:52.440
Or maybe it is possible.

14:52.527 --> 14:53.541
What? No!

14:53.628 --> 14:54.612
Penny's right.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.579
I learned rocket science,
I rebuilt my ship,

14:57.667 --> 14:59.948
why can't I fit you all
in the Spear?

15:00.035 --> 15:02.016
I don't know! Why?

15:02.206 --> 15:04.266
No, honey,
she's saying she can.

15:04.354 --> 15:07.288
Oh, really?
Oh ho ho! Thank you!

15:08.799 --> 15:10.458
You all helped me.

15:10.674 --> 15:12.542
This is the least I can do.

15:12.630 --> 15:15.379
Pack your bags!
We're all going to Earth!

15:15.550 --> 15:16.865
Yeah!

15:16.952 --> 15:19.185
- Earth! Earth! Earth! Earth!
- Rrrr arrr!

15:20.820 --> 15:22.331
Waah! Oof!

15:23.388 --> 15:24.569
So you see, Louie,

15:24.726 --> 15:26.854
true royalty
comes from within.

15:26.962 --> 15:29.714
Yeah, right, sure. So the real king
won't be needing this crown, right?

15:29.801 --> 15:31.315
Wha...

15:33.698 --> 15:35.650
Oh, boy.
You don't look so good.

15:35.737 --> 15:37.151
I'm fine.

15:37.323 --> 15:40.167
Everything's... f-f-fine.

15:40.596 --> 15:42.087
Uncle Donald, I need
a caravan of camels...

15:42.174 --> 15:43.517
I got an offer to host
Dewey Dew-nite in Demagorgana!

15:43.604 --> 15:44.636
There's
a sword horse stampede...

15:44.723 --> 15:46.260
...to search
for the desert ship of Galleon!

15:46.347 --> 15:48.471
Everything is not fine.

15:53.621 --> 15:55.049
Uncle Donald?

15:59.094 --> 16:01.125
It's a mass exodus!

16:01.213 --> 16:02.596
Ow! Lieutenant!

16:02.684 --> 16:04.798
She's brainwashed them
with lies and magical bracelets!

16:04.885 --> 16:06.247
She's gonna
get them killed!

16:06.334 --> 16:08.082
Slow down.
What's happening?

16:08.169 --> 16:09.711
She's taking them
all to Earth.

16:09.799 --> 16:11.586
She's destroying Tranquility!

16:11.673 --> 16:14.923
Our people have to be free
to make their own decisions.

16:15.010 --> 16:17.446
She's a liar!
She's definitely up to something,

16:17.534 --> 16:18.907
and she's
never washed a dish!

16:18.995 --> 16:20.189
Who you talking about?

16:20.276 --> 16:22.299
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

16:22.387 --> 16:24.190
I... We weren't
talking about you.

16:24.285 --> 16:26.305
We were talking about
another foul beaked beast.

16:26.393 --> 16:27.336
You don't know her.

16:27.424 --> 16:29.070
I found this
over by the statue.

16:29.157 --> 16:30.872
You guys helped me
fix my Spear.

16:30.959 --> 16:32.596
It's only right
that I fix yours.

16:32.735 --> 16:35.500
Thank you, Della,
that's too kind.

16:35.588 --> 16:36.995
These are my kids.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.913
Their heads aren't
really shaped like eggplants.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.385
I'm not a good artist.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.737
But thanks to you,

16:41.825 --> 16:43.674
I'm going to have a
chance to be a good mom.

16:43.924 --> 16:46.594
I know what it's like to be
separated from your people.

16:46.682 --> 16:49.890
To be forced to trust
someone else to protect them.

16:50.034 --> 16:52.336
No one could ever
protect your people

16:52.424 --> 16:53.594
as well as you, Penny.

16:53.681 --> 16:55.163
But as long
as they're with me,

16:55.250 --> 16:56.899
I'll try with all I've got.

16:56.987 --> 16:58.217
I promise.

17:07.529 --> 17:08.910
Waaah!

17:08.997 --> 17:11.846
Oh, no! The kids!
What now?!

17:13.867 --> 17:15.415
What's all this?

17:15.502 --> 17:18.041
Uncle Donald, you work
so hard taking care of us.

17:18.130 --> 17:19.511
And we
don't make it easy.

17:19.598 --> 17:21.117
Often on purpose.

17:21.213 --> 17:23.898
So we arranged
a month-long cruise

17:23.987 --> 17:27.424
in the glassy waters of the
Caribbean on the S.S. 40 Winks.

17:27.582 --> 17:31.099
No phones. No adventure.
And lots of hammocks.

17:31.186 --> 17:33.985
Thanks. But I can't
leave the boys.

17:34.073 --> 17:35.940
Who's going
to keep you out of trouble?

17:36.028 --> 17:38.297
We have an entire family
to keep us safe.

17:38.385 --> 17:39.815
Go relax.

17:39.903 --> 17:41.260
Plus the cruise
is non-refundable,

17:41.348 --> 17:43.521
and I will not give charity
to layabout cruise companies,

17:43.608 --> 17:45.026
do you hear me, lad?!

17:49.081 --> 17:51.619
Okay, maybe Della's
not pure evil,

17:51.706 --> 17:53.664
but she's still planning
to take my people

17:53.752 --> 17:55.790
to that planet
of nightmare horrors tomorrow.

17:55.948 --> 17:58.198
Uh! Why can't she
just go now?!

18:14.829 --> 18:16.711
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

18:16.870 --> 18:18.980
<i>T-Minus 40... 39...</i>

18:19.067 --> 18:22.157
Buh? I told you, Penny,
I'll wash the dishes tomorrow.

18:22.245 --> 18:25.182
The Spear!
What's going on?!

18:25.270 --> 18:26.720
I... don't know?

18:26.808 --> 18:28.222
There must have been
a malfunction!

18:28.309 --> 18:29.448
I can't stop it!

18:29.536 --> 18:31.518
The emergency launch
is irreversible!

18:31.646 --> 18:34.612
Go! Get back
to your family!

18:34.700 --> 18:36.214
But what about the others?!

18:36.302 --> 18:38.251
I can't leave them behind!
I promised!

18:38.339 --> 18:40.206
We'll build more.

18:40.482 --> 18:42.002
Give me the plans for the ship.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.135
We'll build a fleet,

18:43.223 --> 18:44.472
and we'll follow you
to Earth shortly.

18:44.559 --> 18:46.672
You've inspired
my people, Della!

18:46.760 --> 18:48.376
Let me return the favor!

18:48.463 --> 18:52.479
<i>Thirteen... 12... 11...</i>

18:52.567 --> 18:54.215
<i>ten... nine...</i>

18:54.474 --> 18:57.657
<i>eight... seven... six...</i>

18:57.814 --> 19:00.547
<i>five... four... three...</i>

19:00.635 --> 19:02.596
<i>two... one.</i>

19:12.678 --> 19:14.742
I'm coming, boys!

19:14.844 --> 19:17.523
Mom is coming home!

19:25.979 --> 19:28.061
Sir, what are you doing?

19:28.248 --> 19:29.584
Huh?

19:29.849 --> 19:31.068
What's going on?

19:31.156 --> 19:33.237
The Spear, it's gone!

19:33.474 --> 19:34.589
Della betrayed you.

19:34.676 --> 19:36.412
She betrayed us all!

19:36.500 --> 19:39.097
She lured us with sad stories

19:39.185 --> 19:41.043
and fabulous falsehoods
about Earth

19:41.131 --> 19:43.097
so that we'd help her
rebuild her ship.

19:43.184 --> 19:45.800
Then when the time was right,
she attacked me!

19:45.888 --> 19:49.570
But what about her family?
And all those stories?

19:49.657 --> 19:51.305
An elaborate deception.

19:51.392 --> 19:53.641
- Oh, no!
- But why?

19:53.728 --> 19:57.078
Because she was just the
first wave of a bigger attack.

19:57.165 --> 19:59.230
She lied to us
so that she could get back

19:59.318 --> 20:01.224
to tell her fellow Earthers
that we are weak!

20:01.312 --> 20:04.029
Soft! Primed for an invasion!

20:04.117 --> 20:05.683
But are we going
to hide down here

20:05.771 --> 20:07.755
- and wait to be invaded?
- No!

20:07.842 --> 20:09.423
Or are we going
to take these plans

20:09.560 --> 20:11.589
that I wrestled away from
the traitor as she fled,

20:11.677 --> 20:15.237
and use them to build a fleet
of ships and invade them first!

20:15.325 --> 20:16.531
Yes!

20:16.618 --> 20:18.276
And prove that the Moon

20:18.364 --> 20:21.102
is the greatest planet
in the universe?!

20:21.189 --> 20:22.103
Yeahhhh!

20:22.190 --> 20:23.771
We are the mighty!

20:23.858 --> 20:25.206
We are the Moon!

20:25.293 --> 20:27.275
Moon! Moon! Moon!

20:27.362 --> 20:29.005
Moon! Moon!

20:31.532 --> 20:33.138
You wanted this all along.

20:33.271 --> 20:35.487
You brought her
and her ship here.

20:35.575 --> 20:37.852
Got them
on her side. Why?

20:37.939 --> 20:40.888
Because the others are not
warriors like you and I.

20:40.975 --> 20:42.690
They needed
a reason to fight.

20:42.778 --> 20:45.208
So I gave them one:
betrayal.

20:45.317 --> 20:47.065
And I got her
to give me these,

20:47.176 --> 20:50.092
with a little good old
Earth compassion.

20:50.247 --> 20:52.400
But you're risking
the lives of our people!

20:52.544 --> 20:54.005
- Aren't you afraid that...
- No!

20:54.093 --> 20:57.489
I will not spend my life in fear
of the Earth like my father.

20:57.659 --> 21:00.013
The Earth will fear me.

21:00.247 --> 21:02.075
But why did you
pair her with me?

21:02.200 --> 21:05.372
Honestly? It was the only way
I could get her to move here.

21:05.578 --> 21:07.260
She actually liked you,
Penumbra.

21:07.371 --> 21:10.272
Said you reminded her
of her brother.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.073
Huh? Huh?!

21:21.161 --> 21:22.415
It can't be!

21:25.691 --> 21:26.990
Della?!

21:28.807 --> 21:30.911
Della? Della!

21:31.005 --> 21:32.440
Where are you?!

21:33.827 --> 21:35.323
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

21:35.411 --> 21:36.677
Aw, phooey.

21:36.765 --> 21:38.341
<i>T-minus 60.</i>

21:38.429 --> 21:40.844
<i>- Thirty... eight...</i>
- Uh! Uh! No!

21:40.932 --> 21:42.750
<i>- ...three... two...</i>
- No! Nooooo!

21:42.838 --> 21:44.038
<i>...one.</i>
