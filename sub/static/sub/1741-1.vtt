04:28.468 --> 04:29.702
Yes, ma'am.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.936
Thank you, Pat.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.486
Hey, you.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.020
Hi, Dad.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.122
Where are you?

04:49.123 --> 04:50.990
You're not home.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.493
No, I'm at my friend's house.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.927
I'm calling from my phone, so...

04:56.729 --> 04:58.564
How... how is everything?

04:58.565 --> 05:00.633
Good. Good. Things are good.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.935
Just, you know, I'm tired and...

05:02.936 --> 05:04.103
I bet.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.671
A lot of work.

05:05.672 --> 05:06.773
A lot of books.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.108
Yeah.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.077
Oh!

05:11.078 --> 05:13.513
Taste of Chicago, hot delivery.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.815
Uh, want a bite? You want a bite.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.418
- Oh, my God.
- One little bite.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.586
I miss that place so much.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.822
Stop, stop.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.524
I'm picking you up
from the airport.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.692
We're going right there when
you come in the weekend.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.060
Awesome.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.797
Finals? Good, bad, what?

05:30.798 --> 05:33.032
They were fine.
Nothing too intense.

05:33.033 --> 05:37.068
But, um... It was... it was good.

05:38.704 --> 05:40.006
What's the matter?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.674
No, what? What do you mean?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.811
Oh, nothing, I... I,
um, just a little, uh...

05:44.812 --> 05:47.013
you seem a little down.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.749
I don't know, maybe I'm
getting the flu or something.

05:49.750 --> 05:53.117
- I don't know.
- <i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

05:54.654 --> 05:57.490
I... I gotta go. I...

05:57.491 --> 06:00.693
I have an exam tomorrow,
and, um, I should go.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.929
Okay.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.898
Yeah, I don't want to
keep you from studying.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.233
Dad...

06:11.204 --> 06:14.507
I... I can't wait for next weekend.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.041
Me, too.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.079
Miss you.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.514
I miss you.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.648
Take care.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.118
Bye.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.189
What?

08:02.115 --> 08:04.650
Yeah?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.620
Hey, uh, who's... Wh-who's this?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.088
Who's this?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.289
You're the one calling me.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.991
I'm, uh, Beth's father.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.328
I'm looking for Beth. Is she there?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.064
Shit, this ain't even my phone.

08:38.619 --> 08:42.054
<i>Hi, you've reached Beth.
You know what to do.</i>

08:43.222 --> 08:45.257
Hey, Beth, it's dad.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.693
Um... I just called your phone,

08:47.694 --> 08:50.096
and, uh, I don't know,
some guy answered it.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.397
He didn't seem to know who
you were, so I wond...

08:51.398 --> 08:54.233
I... did you lose your
phone or something?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.769
But, uh, if you did, you're
probably not getting this.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.137
Anyway, uh, give me a call.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.674
Also, yeah, I got a, uh...
a notice from school

09:01.675 --> 09:03.943
about something,
but I'll... you know,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.577
we'll talk about it, um...

09:07.413 --> 09:09.181
Just call me.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.783
All right, bye-bye.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.925
Hey, it's Dad.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.161
Just calling again.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.397
Don't want to bother
you, just, um...

09:24.398 --> 09:26.198
I don't know, just give me a call.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.466
Thanks.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.744
Westwood Palms.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.680
<i>Yes, this is Paul Brennan.</i>

09:40.681 --> 09:42.348
Uh, my daughter is Beth Brennan.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.685
I called earlier and I
talked to a, uh... a Justin.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.420
Uh, he was gonna go check on her.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.722
Um, I've been trying to call.
There's no answer.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.157
Doesn't look like anybody's
been there for a while.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.626
Okay.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.098
Thank you.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.836
- There you go.
- Okay.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.814
Let me, uh... let me
ask you something.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.450
You see either of these...
Two girls here tonight?

11:58.451 --> 11:59.585
Couldn't tell you, man.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.887
After a while, they
all look the same.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.322
Okay.

12:24.044 --> 12:28.013
Excuse me, uh, I'm wondering if
you could help me for a second.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.849
Whatcha drinkin'?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.417
No, no, I just, uh...

12:31.418 --> 12:33.419
I-I-I'm looking for my daughter...

12:33.420 --> 12:35.588
In the stripes.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.090
Well, like the sign says, you
want a beer or a shot of whisky?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.860
No, no, I just...

12:40.861 --> 12:42.595
Have you seen either of
these girls here tonight?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.630
All right, here it is.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.632
It's gonna be $4.00.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.201
How 'bout this?

12:49.202 --> 12:53.639
You just take this 20, look at the
picture, and give me an answer.

12:55.126 --> 13:00.346
Sorry, buddy, haven't seen either of
them tonight. Good luck with that.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.580
Can I have a water, please?

13:04.350 --> 13:06.417
Water.

13:09.154 --> 13:10.921
Thank you.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.494
Here you go.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.029
Thank you.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.537
<i>And I won't have to lose it.</i>

13:25.538 --> 13:27.106
Don't be aggressive.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.276
- Go to the next bar.
- Yeah.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.011
Let's go. That'd be nice.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.279
Excuse me.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
Not interested.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.581
Just give me a second.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.918
Miss, I'm... I'm Beth's father.

13:38.919 --> 13:42.154
- Really?
- Nick, uh, it's okay.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.956
Where'd you get this?

13:43.957 --> 13:46.025
From her apartment, which
I've been calling for a week,

13:46.026 --> 13:47.493
and there's no answer,
so I'm just wondering...

13:47.494 --> 13:50.095
Oh, so you've been
going though her stuff.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.664
Well, I'm worried about her.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.967
I don't know where she is.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.535
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.003
- Yeah, this place sucks.
- Yeah.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.205
Let me ask you one thing...

14:00.206 --> 14:01.206
- Hey, wait!
- Hey!

14:01.207 --> 14:02.508
Let go of her, asshole!

14:02.509 --> 14:04.677
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!</i>

14:04.678 --> 14:06.679
That's enough. Everybody...

14:08.248 --> 14:09.982
<i>Hey, hey! Come on!</i>

14:09.983 --> 14:13.018
Can you help me? Just five minutes.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.552
That's all.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.024
Uh, hey, you guys go ahead. I'm
gonna meet up with you later.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.592
This is such bullshit.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.996
- I said I'll meet up with you later.
- Whatever.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.098
Uhh.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.199
Are you all right?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.034
I'm fine.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.736
Just a few questions.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.204
I already told you,
I don't know where she is.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.039
You're her friend, right?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.708
So you know her. You
have some ideas.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.443
Anything, where she... I... I...

14:37.444 --> 14:40.678
Five minutes. Give me five minutes.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.582
I'm hungry.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.093
So you haven't heard from her.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.761
People change. We're in college.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.697
We have lots of
distractions. It's real...

14:58.698 --> 15:00.099
I understand that,
I understand that.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.035
It's just I don't know where she is.
That's never been the case before.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.303
You're her friend, you're telling
me you don't know where she is.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.339
So... any help you can give me.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.375
I'm not a bad person.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.444
Okay, I do what any other
person my age does.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.147
I like to go out. I like to party.
I like to have a good time.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.783
I work hard. Beth?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.184
She doesn't go to school anymore.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.787
She... is doing shit
that I'm not into.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.057
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.091
You do know, you said...

15:26.092 --> 15:27.126
what does that mean?

15:27.127 --> 15:30.265
So, a month ago, we
went to New Orleans,

15:30.266 --> 15:32.431
and ended up meeting
this guy named Eddie.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.733
Thinks he's this bad-ass because

15:34.734 --> 15:37.569
he's got drugs everywhere, and
everyone here probably knows him,

15:37.570 --> 15:40.105
'cause they go to him
to get some shit.

15:40.106 --> 15:44.675
But... she fell for it
and fell for him.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.212
She said she was gonna
go down last week

15:47.213 --> 15:49.415
and that she'd be back Sunday,
and I haven't heard from her.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.784
Do you know this guy?

15:51.785 --> 15:53.452
Everybody knows this guy.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.771
Yeah, but do you... do
you know where he works?

15:54.772 --> 15:56.822
Do you know where he lives? Do you know
where he deals? Any of those things?

15:56.823 --> 15:59.058
I told you, New Orleans.
Are you not listening?

15:59.059 --> 16:02.061
New Orleans is a big city. Do you
know where you can find him?

16:02.062 --> 16:06.130
I'm... yeah. I know
people that know him.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.169
Can you drive me down
there right now?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.136
I'll give you some money.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.704
Um, I don't know

16:12.705 --> 16:14.206
if you can tell...
I'm really drunk.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.674
- I'll drive your car.
- I cannot drive.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.577
I'll give you $500. We drive down.
Just point out where he lives.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.145
It doesn't matter,
whenever we get there.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.647
You can go right back.
That's all I'm asking.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.815
Wait, can you just
go back a second?

16:22.816 --> 16:24.850
- You'll...
- Did you say $500?

16:24.851 --> 16:27.051
Yeah.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.522
- Are you messing with me?
- No.

16:34.226 --> 16:37.928
- I mean, it's the middle of the night.
- Now.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.867
Thank you. Check!

17:03.689 --> 17:05.689
Can I ask you something?

17:06.724 --> 17:09.627
- Yeah.
- If you're so worried about Beth,

17:09.628 --> 17:11.829
why wouldn't you
just call the cops?

17:11.830 --> 17:14.433
Because they wouldn't even
do anything for 48 hours...

17:14.434 --> 17:16.234
Unless I reported her missing.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.338
And even then, they're not
gonna give it any priority.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.673
They'd just assume she's
some teen who ran away.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.911
Which she kind of has,
if you think about it.

17:31.416 --> 17:33.185
Not the Beth I know.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.721
How many Beths do
you think there are?

17:39.191 --> 17:41.025
One.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.744
You know what I think?

18:01.547 --> 18:03.448
I think this whole
thing's your fault.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.950
You're the stereotype.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.486
You're like one of those
hard-ass parents that...

18:07.487 --> 18:08.921
Just doesn't get it.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.190
It's like the more you keep
someone from doing something,

18:11.191 --> 18:12.758
they more they want to try it.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.427
So, uh, your suggestion
is that I...

18:15.428 --> 18:17.930
I should encourage her more
to get drunk and stoned

18:17.931 --> 18:19.932
and maybe participate in that.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.767
Is that what your dad did?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.269
No, that is not what I'm saying.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.339
What I'm saying is that you should
just let her be a teenager.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.209
You know, it's natural
to experience things.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.445
And, from what I heard,
you kept her on lockdown

18:33.446 --> 18:35.881
and you barely let her
out of the house.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.317
What'd you expect?

18:38.318 --> 18:39.651
Is that what she said?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.687
<i>Come on.</i>

18:41.688 --> 18:44.289
Uhh! Come on, you can't
keep a kid locked up,

18:44.290 --> 18:46.992
because then they finally get
out there in the real world,

18:46.993 --> 18:48.961
and they start experiencing all the
shit that they've been missing,

18:48.962 --> 18:50.696
and then they go crazy.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.533
You know, it's like they're
trying to make up for lost time.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.734
You are so annoying.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.375
You think this Eddie
character will be in there?

19:36.376 --> 19:38.877
It's where we met him.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.848
When we get in there, I want you
to keep a little distance from me.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.017
In this city, it's gonna
be better off for you

19:45.018 --> 19:48.053
if people don't realize
we're together.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.554
What are you talking about?

19:49.555 --> 19:51.822
Just trust me on that.

19:55.594 --> 19:58.597
So I'm just gonna go find a
quiet little corner to sit in.

19:58.598 --> 20:02.034
Spend a few minutes out here,
and then follow me and...

20:02.035 --> 20:04.403
Just do whatever you normally do.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.773
You see this Eddie guy,
just let me know somehow.

20:07.774 --> 20:12.544
Just... try and tell me about it,
but don't be real obvious, okay?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.478
Okay.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.098
Ahh.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.977
Beth?

22:01.019 --> 22:02.687
You wanna dance?

22:02.688 --> 22:05.023
Is he here?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.725
Come on.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.828
I swear, no one will
know we're together.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.063
Just some creepy old
man and his young girl.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.064
Easy.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.166
Mmm.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.201
Is he here?

22:16.202 --> 22:18.836
No.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.074
What do you want?

22:24.477 --> 22:27.612
I'm just trying to have some fun.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.849
Oh, I feel so good right now.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.584
You should try it sometime.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.023
I know a place we could go.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.558
Like this?

22:39.559 --> 22:41.626
Mm... yeah.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.361
It's like the only
place that's open.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.147
- Would you slow down, man?
- How far away is this place?

22:58.148 --> 22:59.711
I don't know, it's like
right down the strip.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.513
- Like 10 or 15 minutes.
- Come on, please.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.782
Let's go. Come on.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.750
Wait, wait, wait.

23:05.751 --> 23:07.686
Did you see that guy
in the camo vest?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.221
- Come on, bring the girls, dude.
- That him?

23:09.222 --> 23:11.590
No, but I've seen
them hang out a lot.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.525
- <i>All right, cool.</i>
- Wait here.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.626
Hey, man, right up here. I'm there.

23:14.627 --> 23:17.796
Hey... I'm, uh, looking for Eddie.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.531
Do I know you?

23:19.532 --> 23:21.867
Just tell me where he is, I...
I have something for him.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.702
If you did, you'd know
where to find him.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.936
Get the fuck out of here.

23:24.937 --> 23:28.273
- Not until you tell me where he is.
- You just fucked yourself, buddy.

23:28.274 --> 23:29.975
Uhh!

23:29.976 --> 23:31.276
<i>Get him!</i>

23:33.045 --> 23:36.181
Back off!

23:36.182 --> 23:39.784
If I ever see you here
again, you're a dead man.

23:39.785 --> 23:42.052
Crazy motherfucker.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.592
You're not going anywhere.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.294
Fine by me.

23:49.295 --> 23:53.064
We can do this all day
long for all I care.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.258
Holy shit, what was that?

24:20.259 --> 24:22.059
Are you okay?

24:23.662 --> 24:25.630
Find his number. Find his number.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.732
Send him a text, ask
him where he is.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.168
Well, what if I don't hear
back from him for hours?

24:31.170 --> 24:33.171
That's why you need me.

24:39.644 --> 24:43.615
Wait, wait a minute.
What the fuck was that?

24:43.616 --> 24:44.783
Seriously!

24:44.784 --> 24:47.319
What the fuck just happened?

24:47.320 --> 24:50.622
Ohh! Can you take me
home? I wanna go home.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.224
We're going to a place right up
here where you can crash for a bit.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.726
You gotta come down.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.661
Okay, on a scale of one to 10...

24:56.662 --> 24:59.064
10 being, I don't know,
the Sistine chapel,

24:59.065 --> 25:02.200
and one being a steaming
pile of shit...

25:02.201 --> 25:04.002
how nice are we talking?

25:04.003 --> 25:05.036
Probably a three.

25:05.037 --> 25:09.708
Three? That's like... that's
like two steps away from shit!

25:13.079 --> 25:15.146
Can you walk?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.983
Seriously, are we staying here?

25:17.984 --> 25:22.053
Oh my... you know, there's
places that aren't too expensive

25:22.054 --> 25:23.788
that actually wash
their sheets, right?

25:23.789 --> 25:25.991
Not today. We're here.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.193
I know people. I can get
us a room somewhere.

25:28.194 --> 25:32.596
Oh, I'm sure you do.
We have a room.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.675
Okay, now that
we're all settled in,

25:43.676 --> 25:44.876
do you want to tell
me what's going on?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.745
We're getting some sleep.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.645
That's not what I'm talking about.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.650
You don't go to the cops.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.953
You don't want to be seen together.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.722
You take me to this shit hole
in the middle of nowhere.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.691
You beat those guys
like it was nothing.

25:59.692 --> 26:02.160
I need some answers.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.230
You're in no condition to
have any answers right now.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.698
- Let's just get some sleep.
- It's fine.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.266
I'm just tired.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.370
Thank you, Beth's dad.

26:16.409 --> 26:19.444
Ohh, can you just drive
me home, please?

26:19.445 --> 26:21.146
I can't believe I got
myself into this shit.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.280
Oh, my God.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.815
I have the worst headache ever.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.717
This is ridiculous.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.687
I'm just so tired.

26:28.688 --> 26:32.157
Will you drive me home? This
is not what I signed up for.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.125
I don't know why you won't
let me just, like, text the guy.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.794
I go and I party there
all the time.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.797
Like, we could stay in
a really nice place...

26:38.798 --> 26:42.133
clean beds and hot showers and...

27:39.491 --> 27:41.758
I'm sorry.

27:43.895 --> 27:46.229
Who are you?

27:47.098 --> 27:49.366
Beth's dad.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.886
Did this hurt?

28:07.887 --> 28:09.920
Yes.

28:16.895 --> 28:18.897
Does it still hurt?

28:18.898 --> 28:21.331
A bit.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.173
How did she die?

28:28.174 --> 28:30.540
Leukemia.

28:32.343 --> 28:35.412
Beth never really talked about it.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.916
She mentioned you.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.786
She missed you.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.326
Well, I bet you helped her
with that homesickness, huh?

28:48.327 --> 28:49.993
Mm-hmm.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.997
Introduced her to
all the right people?

28:55.233 --> 28:58.169
Like the ones who'll
give you a line of blow

28:58.170 --> 29:01.771
for a favor in the most
convenient bathroom stall?

29:02.340 --> 29:04.475
I bring my own to the party.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.243
Oh.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.924
Is that him?

29:24.395 --> 29:26.630
Yeah.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.268
He's at some bar called Excite.

29:45.483 --> 29:48.186
He's sitting at a table
on the second floor.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.354
You can't miss him... he's
sandwiched between two girls.

29:53.391 --> 29:54.525
What's this?

29:54.526 --> 29:56.928
It's not enough?

29:56.929 --> 29:59.097
You want me to leave?

29:59.098 --> 30:01.933
We had an arrangement.

30:01.934 --> 30:05.303
But... What about Beth?

30:05.304 --> 30:08.239
I didn't come all
this way to not know.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.009
I need you to leave.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.012
Ohh, fuck!

30:16.015 --> 30:17.448
Black jack, Mr. Riley?

30:17.449 --> 30:19.117
Yeah, that's good, Carl. Thanks.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.019
Anything else I can get you?

30:21.020 --> 30:24.354
No, that's good. Leave the bottle.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.970
Son of a bitch.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.207
Carl...

30:43.208 --> 30:44.609
Bring another glass.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.509
You got it, boss.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.532
Do you mind if I take a seat?

31:07.533 --> 31:09.634
Excuse me?

31:09.635 --> 31:12.003
Mind if I sit down?

31:12.004 --> 31:13.738
Who the fuck are you?

31:13.739 --> 31:16.007
I'm looking for my daughter.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.976
Her name is Beth.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.642
Beth Brennan.

31:21.245 --> 31:23.614
Sorry, man. Never heard of her.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.651
But, uh, there is a club
across the street,

31:26.652 --> 31:30.021
and she's probably spinning
around on a pole right now.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.422
So fuck off.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.094
Ladies, please excuse
us for a moment.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.295
They're not going anywhere.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.030
Only one that's leaving is you.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.331
Seriously.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.067
Who does this fuckin'
guy think he is?

31:43.068 --> 31:46.270
I have no interest whatsoever
in what your business is.

31:46.271 --> 31:49.273
I don't even care how
you know my daughter.

31:49.274 --> 31:52.110
In fact, the less we
know about each other,

31:52.111 --> 31:54.579
the better off you're gonna be.

31:54.580 --> 31:59.017
But I wanna know, and I need
to know, where she is now.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.753
And neither of us are leaving
this table until you tell me.

32:01.754 --> 32:04.454
Is that a fact?

32:05.523 --> 32:09.093
Hey, why don't you girls,
uh... take off, huh?

32:09.094 --> 32:12.028
- What the fuck, man?
- Shut up, Eddie.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.432
Come on, let's go!

32:23.108 --> 32:26.177
I hope you can find it in your heart
to forgive my young friend here.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.047
<i>You know how kids are these days.</i>

32:29.048 --> 32:32.116
Just spouting off, shooting off their
mouth when they don't know shit.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.085
He's not a bad kid.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.421
He's a good kid, basically,

32:36.422 --> 32:39.589
and I'd like to see him
live a little longer.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.536
You don't recognize me, do you?

32:51.537 --> 32:53.805
No, I can't say I do.

32:53.806 --> 32:57.707
I was at Stuart's the night
you took down seven people.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.611
I'd never seen anything like it.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.347
There was guns firing
all over the place.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.087
Every time we'd shoot, we'd miss,

33:09.088 --> 33:12.223
like you made out of...
air or something.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.524
Like a ghost.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.366
And then the bodies started
hitting the ground.

33:22.367 --> 33:25.203
<i>Seven of them, falling
all around me.</i>

33:25.204 --> 33:26.571
<i>I fell, too, but I wasn't hit.</i>

33:26.572 --> 33:28.505
<i>Not yet.</i>

33:29.740 --> 33:31.808
You don't remember this?

33:32.844 --> 33:35.313
<i>You started walking
across the room to me,</i>

33:35.314 --> 33:37.648
<i>stepping over the bodies,</i>

33:37.649 --> 33:39.650
<i>coming right for me,
like you could...</i>

33:39.651 --> 33:42.220
<i>Smell that there was still
somebody alive in the room.</i>

33:42.221 --> 33:46.022
You put your gun
right up to my head.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.462
I waited for you to
pull the trigger.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.096
Closed my eyes.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.735
That gunshot never came.

34:00.571 --> 34:05.174
By the time I had the guts to
open my eyes, you were long gone.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.750
Well...

34:12.751 --> 34:15.251
I used to drink back then.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.927
Well, maybe you let me live
so that, 20 years later,

34:22.928 --> 34:25.295
we'd be sitting in a bar,
and I could tell my nephew

34:25.297 --> 34:28.864
to tell you whatever
you wanna know.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.304
I don't know where she
is, man, I swear.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.810
We went out a few times. She
started getting into harder stuff...

34:39.811 --> 34:42.346
heroin... but I don't do that shit.

34:42.347 --> 34:43.481
It's not what I do.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.782
Where is she?

34:44.783 --> 34:47.784
Last I knew, she was
with The Pharmacy.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.388
You left her at a pharmacy?

34:50.389 --> 34:54.458
The Pharmacy is a scumbag drug
dealer named Tony Martinez.

34:54.458 --> 34:57.862
Yeah, he works out of a
warehouse on the east side.

34:57.863 --> 34:58.963
Where?

34:58.964 --> 35:01.698
23rd and Atlantic.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.238
I'd appreciate...

35:07.239 --> 35:09.507
That you don't talk about
this conversation.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.608
You have my word.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.681
Oh... Stuart's...

35:16.682 --> 35:19.616
I ran out of ammo.

35:25.523 --> 35:28.358
Oh, that guy gives
me the creeps, man.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.800
Beth's my friend, all right?

35:35.801 --> 35:37.668
I'm not just gonna get in
the car and turn around.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.604
What part didn't you
understand about?

35:39.605 --> 35:41.539
Aren't you glad I'm here?

35:41.540 --> 35:42.640
- I'm driving.
- What would you have done?

35:42.641 --> 35:43.641
I'm driving.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.009
Move over.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.010
- Are you gonna take a taxi?
- Let's go.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.171
Go, go.

35:58.689 --> 36:01.157
Come on. Let's go.

36:15.039 --> 36:17.008
Remind me again who this guy is.

36:17.009 --> 36:20.378
Former boxer, been talking
behind your back.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.480
Making himself appear like...

36:22.481 --> 36:23.814
Somebody connected to you.

36:23.815 --> 36:27.918
I heard local vice has taken
a vested interest in him.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.020
Okay.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.389
Donny Musical.

36:31.390 --> 36:34.358
How could you forget that name?

36:34.359 --> 36:36.761
Everybody says you're a real punk.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.929
Now you've been making
problems for me...

36:38.930 --> 36:40.498
My family.

36:40.499 --> 36:44.368
My family and my friends, you
make promises you can't keep.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.703
Borrow money you can't repay.

36:48.406 --> 36:51.542
Down here... You can't
get away with that shit.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.077
- Uh...
- <i>"Uh..."</i>

36:53.078 --> 36:55.846
Don't say anything just yet.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.917
You can do all this bullshit
posturing in L.A. and New York,

36:59.918 --> 37:01.619
but you can't do it down here.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.920
Not in my city.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.458
You think that's gonna
impress anybody?

37:07.459 --> 37:10.928
Donny... nothing is more important

37:10.929 --> 37:12.863
than your name.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.965
<i>And you've been using mine.</i>

37:14.966 --> 37:16.600
You cheated me... you
went behind my back

37:16.601 --> 37:19.836
and took something that
didn't belong to you, Donny.

37:21.972 --> 37:24.408
I'm not gonna forgive you.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.545
Only God forgives.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.080
Bye-bye, Donny.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.813
Uhh!

37:50.935 --> 37:52.903
It's definitely him.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.473
It's been 20 years since
he's been seen in the city.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.974
How can you be so sure?

37:56.975 --> 37:59.443
O'Reilly took special
interest as soon

37:59.444 --> 38:00.444
<i>as he walked in the door.</i>

38:00.445 --> 38:02.446
You bring him to me.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.148
Now, do you understand?

38:04.149 --> 38:06.817
We're tailing him now.

38:08.153 --> 38:11.455
Boss, I know you don't
want to hear this,

38:11.456 --> 38:15.124
but you pay me a lot of money
to give you honest counsel.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.129
Let this one go.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.897
Let what go?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.932
What are you talking about?

38:21.933 --> 38:24.835
Think I can let it go?

38:24.836 --> 38:27.071
You get some people... now.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.906
<i>The best people you can get.</i>

38:30.908 --> 38:34.811
If The Prince is here...
Bring him to me.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.692
Get up as close to him as you can.

38:48.693 --> 38:51.462
So, Beth's dad...

38:51.463 --> 38:52.963
Where are we going?

38:52.964 --> 38:54.165
I'm taking you home.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.467
You're gonna go to
the train station...

38:56.468 --> 38:58.736
- I don't...
- ...'Cause that's best for everybody.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.504
I don't want to go.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.177
I am not going.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.335
<i>Pull over!</i>

39:20.758 --> 39:21.892
Down!

39:42.880 --> 39:43.881
You're okay.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.150
Stay down.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.235
Uhh!

41:01.126 --> 41:02.593
Stay in the car.

41:14.306 --> 41:15.940
Who you working for?

41:15.941 --> 41:16.941
Fuck you.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.110
Who you working for?

41:20.111 --> 41:21.679
Who fuckin' sent you?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.148
- Open up, open up!
- No. No.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.816
There you go.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.652
Who... sent you?

41:28.653 --> 41:31.322
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' eyes
out right now. Who sent you?

41:31.323 --> 41:33.589
Omar.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.726
Omar.

41:38.729 --> 41:41.999
Well, you tell fuckin' Omar
that I'm passing through,

41:42.000 --> 41:44.602
and he better fuckin'
let me pass through.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.068
You remember that?

42:24.808 --> 42:27.645
Wilson's dead.

42:27.646 --> 42:32.182
Joe's in the hospital, but it doesn't
look like he's gonna make it.

42:32.183 --> 42:35.019
I told you to put your
best people on it.

42:35.020 --> 42:39.857
We can do that, but we
don't have much to go on.

42:39.858 --> 42:42.793
The guys at the bar aren't talking.

42:42.794 --> 42:45.796
He's here looking for
a girl, an addict.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.766
<i>That's all we know.</i>

42:48.767 --> 42:51.233
I don't care what it takes.

42:51.769 --> 42:55.171
I feel like I would be remiss...

42:57.074 --> 43:00.076
If I did not reiterate my position.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.213
Your position?

43:05.683 --> 43:07.418
People that have limbs
that are amputated

43:07.419 --> 43:12.254
still feel the pain in that limb,
even though it's not there.

43:15.793 --> 43:18.160
That's the pain that I feel.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.630
Every time I look, I mean...

43:24.835 --> 43:27.137
I see his face.

43:27.138 --> 43:32.374
I feel that pain, and I see
him looking back at me.

43:35.846 --> 43:38.148
We have a chance to get him.

43:38.149 --> 43:40.350
Right now.

43:40.351 --> 43:42.885
Let's go get him.

43:49.727 --> 43:51.161
<i>Just take a breath.</i>

43:51.162 --> 43:53.030
You're gonna be okay.

43:53.031 --> 43:54.965
How the fuck am I
supposed to be okay?

43:54.966 --> 43:56.767
I just...

43:56.768 --> 43:59.568
Just watched you kill someone.

44:00.971 --> 44:02.973
One second, I'm at a college party.

44:02.974 --> 44:06.744
The next second, I'm in New
Orleans, getting shot at.

44:06.745 --> 44:08.879
I need some answers!

44:08.880 --> 44:11.048
Why are they after you? Why?

44:11.049 --> 44:12.483
- What do you want?
- Who are they?

44:12.484 --> 44:13.917
What do you have in here?
What do you want?

44:13.918 --> 44:15.252
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything!

44:15.253 --> 44:17.103
You want some pills?
You want some pot?

44:17.104 --> 44:19.065
- Want some booze?
- No, I want the truth!

44:19.066 --> 44:21.825
- <i>Want some pot? What do you want?</i>
- Look at me! Look at me!

44:21.826 --> 44:23.427
You owe this to me!

44:23.428 --> 44:27.164
- Will you be quiet?
- No, I want the truth.

44:27.165 --> 44:31.535
Why are there a bunch of men after
a fucking mechanic from Mississippi?

44:31.536 --> 44:34.505
What do they want with you?

44:34.506 --> 44:36.907
Who are you?

44:36.908 --> 44:39.341
I'm not a mechanic
from Mississippi.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.980
I was born two blocks from here.

44:42.981 --> 44:47.550
You can see the shitty little
smokestack and the tenement.

44:49.887 --> 44:51.855
<i>I wasn't a mechanic,
I was just a piece of shit</i>

44:51.856 --> 44:54.091
<i>running the streets.</i>

44:54.092 --> 44:57.146
And I got in a situation where I could
go to jail or I can go to the military,

44:57.147 --> 45:00.097
so, obviously, I took the military.

45:00.098 --> 45:03.899
After months, lots and
lots of enemies here.

45:05.302 --> 45:08.505
And I was good.

45:08.506 --> 45:10.374
Why are they after us now?

45:10.375 --> 45:12.042
<i>Because I went and I came back,</i>

45:12.043 --> 45:15.813
and you come back to
what? I come back to this.

45:15.814 --> 45:18.448
<i>And so I had one
opportunity, I thought,</i>

45:18.449 --> 45:20.450
that would get me out,
and of course I took it.

45:20.451 --> 45:22.319
And, of course, I took
the next one after that,

45:22.320 --> 45:25.589
and the next one and the next
one, and I was what I always was,

45:25.590 --> 45:28.324
which is nothing and a liar.

45:28.892 --> 45:31.595
What do they want with you?

45:31.596 --> 45:34.730
I did something 20
years ago for these...

45:35.933 --> 45:38.367
For what? What?

45:39.603 --> 45:41.470
What?

45:45.909 --> 45:48.378
<i>He was, uh, trying to
take over the city,</i>

45:48.379 --> 45:51.248
<i>and it didn't matter
who he eliminated.</i>

45:51.249 --> 45:54.585
<i>And there were lots. Lots.</i>

45:54.586 --> 45:57.921
<i>The violence got to
a point where, uh,</i>

45:57.922 --> 45:59.957
<i>he needed to be stopped.</i>

45:59.958 --> 46:02.259
At the end of the day, you
know who's gonna be here?

46:02.260 --> 46:04.895
- <i>He needed to be stopped.</i>
- You, Daddy.

46:04.896 --> 46:07.130
I love you. Are you okay?

46:07.131 --> 46:09.132
Mm, yeah, kind of.

46:09.133 --> 46:10.400
I miss you.

46:10.401 --> 46:11.635
Come here.

46:11.636 --> 46:14.471
Mm... daddy's girl.

46:14.472 --> 46:15.606
<i>Mmm...</i>

46:15.607 --> 46:17.074
Come here.

46:17.075 --> 46:18.242
Go run over to mommy, yeah?

46:18.243 --> 46:20.077
- Okay.
- Oh, hey!

46:20.078 --> 46:21.945
Look what I have.

46:21.946 --> 46:23.580
What do you have?

46:23.581 --> 46:26.884
This is a present for you on the
first day of school, puppy.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.952
- Thank you.
- Don't open it till you get to class.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.320
Ohh.

46:30.321 --> 46:32.422
Come on, silly, we
don't want to be late.

46:32.423 --> 46:34.157
- Oh, she won't be late.
- Bye, Daddy.

46:34.158 --> 46:36.894
Bye, baby.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.662
<i>Oh, I'm taking your car, okay?</i>

46:38.663 --> 46:42.132
All right. All right.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.468
Rachel, wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.437
I wanna get a picture of you guys.

46:47.438 --> 46:49.907
Cheese!

46:49.908 --> 46:50.974
I love you.

46:50.975 --> 46:53.010
<i>I love you. Bye, honey.</i>

46:53.011 --> 46:54.543
<i>Have fun at school.</i>

46:55.679 --> 46:58.181
Here you go.

46:58.182 --> 47:00.617
<i>And I tried to stop it,
but it was too late.</i>

47:00.618 --> 47:02.552
It was too late to...

47:02.553 --> 47:04.922
it was too late for me.
It was too late for her.

47:34.351 --> 47:39.189
<i>And I'll never forget
the look in her eyes.</i>

47:39.190 --> 47:42.192
Not that I deserve pity for that.

47:42.193 --> 47:43.694
'Cause I don't.

47:43.695 --> 47:46.730
<i>It's just a fact.</i>

47:46.731 --> 47:48.365
<i>So it drove me out of here,</i>

47:48.366 --> 47:50.566
and I left everything.

47:53.704 --> 47:56.740
And woke up somewhere.
I don't know where.

47:56.741 --> 47:59.710
<i>Fucking in a bottle.</i>

47:59.711 --> 48:03.747
And that's where Anna Marie
came in and lifted me up.

48:03.748 --> 48:06.382
<i>Stupidly loved me...</i>

48:07.351 --> 48:10.519
And 12-stepped me to the altar.

48:12.589 --> 48:14.424
<i>And Beth was an accident.</i>

48:14.425 --> 48:15.759
<i>A happy accident.</i>

48:15.760 --> 48:16.760
A blessed accident.

48:16.761 --> 48:18.228
But I can't have it.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.696
What am I gonna do with a child?

48:19.697 --> 48:22.464
I can nurture a child
with my tools?

48:30.607 --> 48:33.777
They're gonna kill Beth if
I don't get to her first.

48:33.778 --> 48:35.779
What?

48:35.780 --> 48:39.514
They're gonna try to kill
me, and they'll kill you.

48:39.515 --> 48:41.518
<i>So I need you to listen to me</i>

48:41.519 --> 48:43.587
<i>and I need you to trust me.</i>

48:43.588 --> 48:46.223
You don't have to like me.

48:46.224 --> 48:47.758
You understand?

48:47.759 --> 48:49.292
Mm-hmm.

48:49.293 --> 48:52.561
<i>And I will get you out of here.</i>

48:59.803 --> 49:02.139
I really appreciate that.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.573
Thank you.

49:06.076 --> 49:08.045
<i>Where are we going?</i>

49:08.046 --> 49:09.179
I'm gonna drop you
off with a friend,

49:09.180 --> 49:10.480
somewhere you're gonna
be safe for a while.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.749
I'll get you when I get Beth back.

49:12.750 --> 49:15.185
Okay, you're leaving
me where, exactly?

49:15.186 --> 49:16.820
I'll bring you back
when I get Beth.

49:16.821 --> 49:19.790
It's someone I trust.

49:19.791 --> 49:22.624
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

49:23.794 --> 49:26.463
Oh, we're stealing a car?

50:08.572 --> 50:10.672
I'm here for Sam.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.543
They're on the way up.

50:23.153 --> 50:26.223
Jesus Christ.

50:28.326 --> 50:30.626
Wow.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.298
Good to see you.

50:35.299 --> 50:36.433
Come on in.

50:36.434 --> 50:37.734
How you been?

50:38.870 --> 50:40.303
I don't know.

50:40.304 --> 50:43.173
Hmm... hmm.

50:43.174 --> 50:44.708
Wow.

50:44.709 --> 50:47.711
This is impressive.

50:47.712 --> 50:49.579
Yeah.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.580
Really.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.551
What do you want, Paul?

50:57.354 --> 50:59.156
I gotta get my daughter.

50:59.157 --> 51:01.458
- Your what?
- My daughter.

51:01.459 --> 51:03.627
She's gone, I've come
here to get her.

51:03.628 --> 51:06.263
She's fallen into some bad stuff.

51:06.264 --> 51:07.898
Fallen into what?

51:07.899 --> 51:10.267
Some guy named "The Pharmacy."

51:10.268 --> 51:11.368
Oh, fuck.

51:11.369 --> 51:13.770
- You know him?
- Yeah.

51:13.771 --> 51:16.138
He's a lunatic.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.276
Can you help me?

51:19.277 --> 51:20.777
Can't do that.

51:20.778 --> 51:23.413
I don't do that stuff
anymore, Paul.

51:23.414 --> 51:25.916
Nothing personal.

51:25.917 --> 51:28.652
You don't have to leave this room.

51:28.653 --> 51:29.920
I will take care of him.

51:29.921 --> 51:32.489
I will take care of him.

51:32.490 --> 51:34.191
What are you asking me to do?

51:34.192 --> 51:35.959
I just want some time, a safe place

51:35.960 --> 51:37.961
<i>for Angela to stay here,</i>

51:37.962 --> 51:40.297
give me some time to get Beth,

51:40.298 --> 51:42.199
and then I need a safe
ride out of here.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.632
Clean.

51:45.869 --> 51:47.537
- Beth's your daughter?
- Yes.

51:47.538 --> 51:50.273
- That's Angela?
- That's right.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.509
Nobody gets hurt?

51:52.510 --> 51:54.211
Clean.

51:54.212 --> 51:56.378
Shit.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.680
Jesus.

52:03.621 --> 52:08.258
You know what'll happen if the word
gets out that I'm with you again?

52:08.259 --> 52:09.726
Right? You know.

52:09.727 --> 52:12.027
I do, yeah. I do.

52:13.530 --> 52:16.466
So if I do this thing,
I'm not gonna see you...

52:16.467 --> 52:18.768
Around town anymore, right?

52:18.769 --> 52:20.770
You're not gonna come back?

52:20.771 --> 52:24.272
You're not gonna see me
anywhere, ever again, friend.

52:25.008 --> 52:28.478
How's your shoulder?

52:28.479 --> 52:29.779
I'm a righty now.

52:29.780 --> 52:32.748
Crazy motherfucker.

52:35.318 --> 52:37.653
Be careful out there.

52:38.021 --> 52:40.957
A lot of the old faces you knew...

52:40.958 --> 52:42.826
Can't trust them anymore.

52:42.827 --> 52:44.427
I never did, Sam.

52:47.931 --> 52:50.332
We'll wait here, then.

52:59.276 --> 53:01.043
Come in.

53:05.983 --> 53:08.250
- Hi.
- Come on in.

53:09.886 --> 53:11.021
You want something to drink?

53:11.022 --> 53:12.389
You want something to eat?

53:12.390 --> 53:14.956
Uh, a drink's great, yeah.

53:17.727 --> 53:19.896
What do you want? You...
we got everything.

53:19.897 --> 53:21.464
Do you have whisky?

53:21.465 --> 53:23.732
I'll get you whisky.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.436
That your boyfriend?

53:27.705 --> 53:29.406
No.

53:29.407 --> 53:32.409
He's my friend's dad.

53:32.410 --> 53:35.412
So are you gonna send
anyone to help him?

53:35.413 --> 53:37.314
No.

53:37.315 --> 53:38.848
I'm not gonna send anybody.

53:38.849 --> 53:41.883
- Thank you.
- He doesn't need any help.

53:42.619 --> 53:45.789
You really don't
know who he is, huh?

53:45.790 --> 53:47.557
Not really.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.459
You know where South Garriston is?

53:49.460 --> 53:51.027
- No.
- No?

53:51.028 --> 53:52.762
Garriston Street.

53:52.763 --> 53:55.031
Old timers called
it Hadrian's Wall.

53:55.032 --> 53:56.700
Oh, I don't know what that is.

53:56.701 --> 53:59.801
When Rome was at the
peak of its powers...

54:00.103 --> 54:03.340
You know, it ran most
of the world, right?

54:03.341 --> 54:06.042
Ran everything,

54:06.043 --> 54:07.410
except in Scotland.

54:07.411 --> 54:10.780
There was this... tribe.

54:10.781 --> 54:13.215
They were so fuckin' crazy...

54:14.517 --> 54:17.754
That, even at the
peak of its powers,

54:17.755 --> 54:21.123
it just wasn't worth it for
the Romans to go in there.

54:22.625 --> 54:27.464
So this emperor, Hadrian,
built a wall across Scotland.

54:27.465 --> 54:30.433
And he just walled 'em up.

54:30.434 --> 54:34.404
Gave 'em a... kingdom
for themselves.

54:34.405 --> 54:37.806
South Garriston was
Paul's territory.

54:38.908 --> 54:42.410
His own little kingdom, where he could
do whatever the fuck he wanted.

54:43.446 --> 54:45.482
And nobody ever dared go in there.

54:45.483 --> 54:48.718
You wouldn't even know his name.

54:48.719 --> 54:50.620
Just called him "The Prince."

54:50.621 --> 54:53.288
"The Prince"?

54:56.393 --> 54:59.961
You better get away from him.

55:30.693 --> 55:32.529
How may I help you?

55:32.530 --> 55:34.197
Looking for Big Mike.

55:34.198 --> 55:36.499
Um, uh...

55:36.500 --> 55:38.535
My Daddy passed a
couple years back.

55:38.536 --> 55:41.638
How can I be of service to you?

55:41.639 --> 55:44.073
My condolences.

55:44.074 --> 55:45.875
Sorry to hear about your old man.

55:45.876 --> 55:48.611
However, I left something
here a while back

55:48.612 --> 55:50.547
and I need to pick it up now.

55:50.548 --> 55:51.815
Oh, yeah.

55:51.816 --> 55:53.216
Let's see.

55:53.217 --> 55:55.718
I don't give a shit how
fast you think you are.

55:55.719 --> 55:59.588
At this range...
I ain't gonna miss.

56:05.528 --> 56:08.097
You better be sure about that.

56:08.098 --> 56:11.534
Now, before my daddy passed...

56:11.535 --> 56:13.503
He told me three things:

56:13.504 --> 56:16.239
Never put 10 pounds of
shit in a five-pound bag,

56:16.240 --> 56:18.908
never take credit when
they got cash in hand,

56:18.909 --> 56:21.177
and if a man walks
through that door

56:21.178 --> 56:24.247
with tattoos like you've
got on your hand,

56:24.248 --> 56:27.183
"son, you better be ready to draw.

56:27.184 --> 56:30.053
'Cause that man...

56:30.054 --> 56:32.922
that man brings hell with
him wherever he goes."

56:32.923 --> 56:36.893
Big Mike helped me escape
this city 20 years ago.

56:36.894 --> 56:40.029
Gave me a new name, a new identity.

56:40.030 --> 56:41.664
I left him something.

56:41.665 --> 56:43.533
We had an agreement.

56:43.534 --> 56:45.235
I'm here to pick that up.

56:45.236 --> 56:48.970
I am going to pick that up.

56:50.139 --> 56:52.108
He was my friend.

56:52.109 --> 56:54.110
Is that so?

56:54.111 --> 56:59.214
Jameson, one ice cube,
one maraschino cherry.

57:01.284 --> 57:03.753
My daddy did have a sweet tooth.

57:03.754 --> 57:06.122
Uh, sorry about this,

57:06.123 --> 57:09.592
but you can never be
too safe around here.

57:09.593 --> 57:13.028
What you're lookin'
for, it's in the back.

57:17.167 --> 57:19.936
This is what you're
looking for, huh?

57:19.937 --> 57:22.539
Looks like the flood
got a hold of this.

57:24.174 --> 57:26.242
Oh, boy.

57:26.243 --> 57:29.078
<i>I could, uh, I could
clean 'em up for you.</i>

57:29.079 --> 57:31.548
Put some oil on 'em.

57:31.549 --> 57:33.550
I don't think the coil
broke on any of 'em.

57:33.551 --> 57:35.318
<i>Probably take me a couple days.</i>

57:35.319 --> 57:38.087
I don't have time.

57:39.990 --> 57:43.692
My daddy didn't have many friends.

57:44.761 --> 57:46.995
So...

57:49.832 --> 57:52.335
You can choose one of these.

57:52.336 --> 57:55.305
Consider it a gift from Big Mike.

57:55.306 --> 57:56.706
<i>Only untraceable weapons</i>

57:56.707 --> 57:58.908
this side of communist California.

57:58.909 --> 58:02.111
I'm gonna need
Mercury-tipped bullets.

58:02.112 --> 58:05.815
I got black talons,
plus Ps, hollow points.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.150
How many you gonna need?

58:09.852 --> 58:11.788
How many you got?

58:41.351 --> 58:43.184
What's up?

58:44.887 --> 58:46.723
What are you doing? Huh?

58:46.724 --> 58:48.925
I'm here to see Tony.

58:48.926 --> 58:51.361
Oh, you must have your
addresses mixed up,

58:51.362 --> 58:53.196
because there ain't no Tony here.

58:53.197 --> 58:54.731
Look, don't waste my fuckin' time.

58:54.732 --> 58:57.100
Tony's your boss, The Pharmacy.
I got some information for him.

58:57.101 --> 59:01.169
- You got an appointment?
- No. But he does.

59:01.771 --> 59:03.206
What's that supposed to mean?

59:03.207 --> 59:05.675
Means if I'm not speaking to
him in the next two minutes,

59:05.676 --> 59:07.677
he's gonna find himself dead...

59:07.678 --> 59:10.412
And we'll throw you
in with the deal.

59:12.649 --> 59:14.651
You'll take that, shy hero?

59:14.652 --> 59:17.253
Okay, handsome. Get those arms up.

59:17.254 --> 59:18.888
Get 'em up, get 'em up. Hmm?

59:18.889 --> 59:21.057
What's this? What do
you got here, hmm?

59:21.058 --> 59:23.159
What does it look like?
Tough neighborhood.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.128
Bet your ass it is, old man.

59:25.129 --> 59:26.763
You can it back on the way out.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.264
Yeah, I will.

59:28.265 --> 59:31.232
Get your ass in there.

59:43.246 --> 59:46.749
Yeah. Yeah, I'm bringing him now.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.097
Come on!

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:13.475
<i>What's wrong with you, man?</i>

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.191
This the guy?

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:29.759
That's him.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.060
Take a seat.

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:34.464
No. I won't be staying long.

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:37.033
Whatever makes you feel happy, pop.

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.835
Jimmy tells me you got
some information for me.

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:42.939
Some sort of tip... That's
gonna save my life.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.440
Matter of fact, I do.

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:46.018
Lay it on me.

01:00:46.019 --> 01:00:48.144
It's about the girl that
you've been living with.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:51.481
- I live with a lot of girls.
- Well, that's good.

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.183
Then you won't miss her when
I take her out of here.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.352
Her name is Beth,

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.821
Beth Brennan, my daughter.

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.259
And she's leaving with me tonight.

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.829
Why are we talking
about bitches, anyway?

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.898
I thought this was a
life-and-death situation.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.335
It is... for you...

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.669
If you don't let me take
her out of here now.

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:18.274
You got this all fucked up, pops.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.409
All wrong.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:24.347
You see... this ain't
no prison cell.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:27.248
Especially your little girl.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.322
I mean, she wanted
to be here so bad,

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:36.624
she actually begged me to stay.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.261
Shit, you can look for yourself.

01:01:46.068 --> 01:01:48.905
<i>She's still doing a
little recuperating.</i>

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:58.848
You know, I ain't did nothing to
her that she didn't ask me to do.

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:00.550
You know how these
kids are these days.

01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:03.419
They get a little taste
of partying and drugs,

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.088
and they just want more
and more and more.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.925
Gotta have it.

01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:13.328
I'm just... a motherfucker
willing to oblige.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.099
Well...

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.101
You best be the
motherfucker that obliges

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.437
by keeping your ass
on that fuckin' couch

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:23.406
while I walk out of here
with her right now,

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:26.209
<i>'cause you won't be
breathing, otherwise.</i>

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:29.245
Okay, that... that...
that's not possible.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.015
You see, I got a call from my man.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:34.617
Omar.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:36.285
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:38.454
He told me you'd show up.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:41.591
Said to keep you here on
ice till he gets here.

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:43.326
And the girl.

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:47.428
Because he got something special
planned for your baby girl.

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.599
Uhh!

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:01.978
<i>Uhh!</i>

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:13.589
Close your eyes, baby. There we go.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.958
Hold on.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:16.959
Keep your eyes closed.

01:03:22.164 --> 01:03:24.267
Don't open your eyes.

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:26.301
Don't open your eyes.

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:00.703
No, no, we didn't do anything!

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:03.338
I swear, I swear!

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.765
We told you to keep them on ice.

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:38.267
Where are they?

01:05:43.305 --> 01:05:46.342
<i>They're gone.</i>

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.611
<i>They're gone.</i>

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:13.269
Look at that.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.837
You got the 12-year.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:16.105
Yeah.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:18.407
A celebration here.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.775
You ready?

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:22.411
Yeah, hold on.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:26.147
You don't want to waste the
good stuff on a bad shot.

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:42.698
How long till you can
get us out of here?

01:06:42.699 --> 01:06:44.200
I'm working on it.

01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.202
How soon?

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:47.835
I'll handle it.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:50.639
Don't worry.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.907
Okay.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.177
Is word out yet?

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.079
Everybody knows you're back.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.948
I knew that'd happen.

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:04.685
Glad it worked out.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:13.362
We've got him.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:17.081
A man with a bullet wound showed
up this morning at the battle house.

01:07:17.082 --> 01:07:20.693
He had a girl with him who
looked pretty strung out.

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:25.840
Makes sense they would
go to Sam's for sanctuary.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.844
Let everybody know.

01:07:28.845 --> 01:07:31.546
Do not cross my line.

01:07:40.923 --> 01:07:41.924
Hey.

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:44.325
Hi.

01:07:45.794 --> 01:07:47.728
You look pretty.

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.899
You look like shit.

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:54.569
How are you feeling?

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.241
<i>She threw up again,</i>

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.410
so she should be feeling better.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:02.845
It's gonna get worse.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:04.613
Okay, well, I'm gonna
go get a soda.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.649
- Do you want anything?
- <i>No.</i>

01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:09.385
But I need you to get
her ready to travel.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.320
We have to leave. Okay?

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:12.955
Yeah, okay.

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.189
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.236
Hey, you.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:29.971
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:32.173
I know you are.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.312
Just gonna get you home, okay?

01:08:36.313 --> 01:08:39.481
I... I don't think I can go.

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.617
Of course you can.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.252
Everything's changed.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:46.252
Not with me, it hasn't.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.957
You're the only reason
I keep going, Beth.

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:55.229
I don't know what home is anymore.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.767
We'll find it.

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.335
We'll find it.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:50.084
Switch them around.
Just you with me.

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:14.710
I'll see you soon, okay?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.412
Mm-hmm.

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:19.013
- Okay.
- Say good night.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:23.052
I really wish you guys
were coming with me.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.887
I can't protect you both.

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:27.121
I understand.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:32.594
Well, will you call me
when you get home safely?

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.363
Yeah.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:36.598
Don't be too hard on her.

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:37.599
I won't.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.734
Come on, guys.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:41.135
Wait on the corner for the tail.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.218
That's high cotton, blood.

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.063
Jesus Christ.

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:11.133
My heart's pounding.

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:17.072
That Montecristo's
not helping, is it?

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:19.141
No.

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:21.143
It's the adrenaline.

01:11:21.144 --> 01:11:22.644
Yeah.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.813
It's the only thing I miss.

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.725
Nobody makes it through.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.827
Copy that.

01:11:41.865 --> 01:11:44.166
Remember that third street tavern?

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:47.234
Remember that fuckin' clusterfuck?

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.507
You got your shoulder all shot up.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:54.108
Jesus Christ, were we shit-faced.

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:57.713
I don't know how we stumbled
out of there and lived.

01:11:57.714 --> 01:12:00.015
Do you think it was money, Sam?

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.017
Is that what it was all about?

01:12:02.018 --> 01:12:04.620
That's what we thought, right?

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:13.962
Move in.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.896
Copy.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.843
Get her out of here, come on!

01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:48.128
<i>He's got a gun! He's got a gun!</i>

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:05.079
Uhh!

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.631
<i>"Nobody gets hurt."</i>

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:30.766
<i>You motherfucker.</i>

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.239
<i>Get in.</i>

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:44.046
Just keep 'em off
as long as you can.

01:14:44.047 --> 01:14:47.015
Keep 'em off.

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:07.035
I got a daughter of my own.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.269
Whatever you need...

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:12.106
It's yours.

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:21.782
All right.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:53.113
Close the door on your way out.

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.885
Please, I just...

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:59.755
I just wanna go home.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:01.123
Where's home?

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:03.759
Ponto... Pontotoc.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.927
- What?
- Pontotoc.

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.062
What's Pontotoc?

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.666
Pontotoc, Mississippi.

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.401
I used to work with your father.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:14.169
We knew each other.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:15.937
What?

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.440
He took everything from me.

01:16:18.441 --> 01:16:21.241
Your father did.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:24.078
Everything.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:29.183
But you and I can ask him why...

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:34.121
When he comes here... to see you.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:38.427
And you and I are just gonna sit here
and wait for him till he gets here.

01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:41.697
Why?

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:45.232
Baby... stop the scratching.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.804
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:51.438
Please just let me go home.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.847
<i>Listen to me... when we get there,</i>

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:01.750
it'll be 11 minutes before
a response team shows up.

01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.119
So if we're not out that door
by then, you have to go.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.954
You get in your car and you
drive and you don't look back.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.056
- You don't come back.
- Okay.

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.391
Do you understand?

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:11.760
Yeah.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:15.097
Is that okay?

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:17.865
Yep.

01:19:04.105 --> 01:19:05.839
He's here.

01:19:09.477 --> 01:19:11.546
Hey. Hey.

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:13.849
Let's go, come on. Come on, get up.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:15.749
We gotta go.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.595
Paul!

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.201
<i>Say, "Hi, Daddy.
I'm a little scared."</i>

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:15.270
Daddy. Daddy.

01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:17.038
- Louder.
- Daddy.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.707
"Daddy"!

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:20.108
- <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- Daddy!</i>

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:21.609
That's right! "Daddy"!

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.044
Is this what you want?

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.447
- No!
- Is this enough?!

01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:28.548
Let her go and I'll
let you walk away.

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:30.719
You'll never see me again.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.688
That's enough anymore!

01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:36.191
You want me? You take me.

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:39.995
<i>I want you to know
what it's like to lose</i>

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:43.098
the only thing that you
ever loved in your life.

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:44.766
You ready?

01:21:44.767 --> 01:21:46.201
You chose this life,

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:48.570
we chose this life,

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.238
<i>and that's the cost.</i>

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.608
What about my wife and child?!

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:56.011
What did they have to do with it?

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.112
What?!

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.313
Please don't!

01:21:58.314 --> 01:22:00.148
Collateral damage. It was a war.

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:01.750
<i>And you...</i>

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:04.486
Are gonna lose the only thing

01:22:04.487 --> 01:22:07.622
that you ever loved in your life.

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:09.290
Say bye.

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.358
Tell him you love him.

01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:11.426
Tell him you love him.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.361
- No, don't...
- Tell him!

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.330
- Please don't!
- Say it!

01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:17.565
Say, "I love you, Daddy"!

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:21.803
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

01:22:21.804 --> 01:22:24.771
<i>No... please...</i>

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:53.567
Having a good time. Good time.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:00.175
Mm-hmm.

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:13.687
Uhh!

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:16.089
Ohh!

01:23:34.375 --> 01:23:37.210
<i>Shh, shh, shh. Quiet now.</i>

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:02.403
See him? See him?

01:24:02.404 --> 01:24:04.639
Come on, come on, come on.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.207
All right, all right, all right.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:07.609
Good girl. Good girl.

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:09.844
You're very brave. Very brave.

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:12.212
See him?

01:24:17.418 --> 01:24:19.888
There he is. Daddy.

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:23.224
Hi, Daddy. Say hi.

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.363
<i>One...</i>

01:24:28.364 --> 01:24:30.163
Two...

01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:36.770
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.910
Shoot now.

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:48.582
Shoot now.

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:47.741
Let's go home.
