WEBVTT

00:46.921 --> 00:47.797
Hello?

00:53.720 --> 00:54.596
Hello?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.143
You hear that?

01:45.188 --> 01:46.606
It's coming from the piano.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.528
- Okay...

01:52.028 --> 01:53.154
Hold on, we...

01:53.696 --> 01:55.115
we should think about this.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.283
It's the whispering, just like Bode said.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.886
You guys can hear it, too?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
-What'd you find?
-Okay, shh.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.100
Mom's still asleep.

02:22.725 --> 02:23.893
Let me see.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.815
I think I've seen this before somewhere.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.316
Seen what?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.694
Where it goes. Over here.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.492
- Just... stop.

02:41.536 --> 02:45.039
We need to get that brown box up there,
with the swirls.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.584
I saw it when we were unpacking.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.089
Abracadabra?

03:35.840 --> 03:38.009
- I think it's broken.
- So,

03:38.301 --> 03:39.469
we can all hear them now.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.221
What does that mean?

03:41.304 --> 03:44.599
That means we can all be
the protectors of the keys.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.893
Well Lady can't take them from us.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.270
I'm not alone anymore.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.231
You were never alone, little man.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.025
We haven't seen her for, like,
over two weeks.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.403
So? In her world that could be, like,
five minutes.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.614
She could be, like, 10,000 years old!

03:59.697 --> 04:00.740
Yeah, okay, Bode.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.492
-And she's still out there!
-I know.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.579
All right, so, for safety's sake,
we should split up the keys.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.331
Where are the other ones?

04:09.624 --> 04:10.541
Right here.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.548
Head Key, Mirror Key and Ghost Key.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.009
Kinsey, you take this new music box one.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.470
Bode, you keep the...

04:22.595 --> 04:24.889
the Ghost Key and the Mirror Key.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.933
-And I'm gonna take the Head Key.
- Yeah!

04:27.016 --> 04:28.518
Good. Always keep them with you.

04:28.601 --> 04:33.022
And by the way, before we use the keys,
we're all talking about it first.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.775
Enough with the orders!
We can manage ourselves.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.860
Yeah, you're in great shape.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.154
Just because I don't have fear
doesn't make me irrational.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.614
So, shut your mouth, Tyler.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.075
- Mm--
-Besides, it's not like you're so above

04:44.158 --> 04:44.993
using the keys.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.954
Didn't you use the Head Key
to try and get with Jackie? Hmm?

04:48.329 --> 04:49.872
-Didn't you?

04:50.331 --> 04:51.958
-All right, very funny.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.718
-Tyler...

05:03.469 --> 05:05.346
-Slap yourself in the face.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.475
-Holy shit!
- How'd you do that?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.395
I think it's the music box.
Tyler, open your mouth.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.149
Hold on, let me try this.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.693
Kinsey,

05:19.110 --> 05:20.361
do a back flip.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.036
I'm the one that put the key in...

05:29.746 --> 05:31.539
so it only does what I say.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.208
Bode,

05:35.168 --> 05:36.002
pick your nose.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.338
Oh, my God. No, no.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.672
- Ooh...
-These things...

05:40.423 --> 05:43.343
-These aren't toys. They're weapons.

05:43.926 --> 05:47.638
So, until we need them,
we're not gonna use them.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.015
Why can't they be both?

05:57.273 --> 05:58.483
Come on.

06:01.986 --> 06:02.987
I'm not alone.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.531
There's three of us now.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.589
Morning, Mom.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.967
-Mom?

06:26.844 --> 06:27.678
Morning.

06:28.805 --> 06:29.639
You okay?

06:30.223 --> 06:33.267
Yeah, I just haven't been sleeping
all that well.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.395
You know, I've had, like,

06:35.478 --> 06:38.481
four different guys come take a look
at that stove and no one

06:39.273 --> 06:40.525
can find anything wrong with it.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.902
I just... don't get it.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.738
It's probably just a fluke.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.033
Isn't today your first day back
on the hockey team?

06:49.617 --> 06:51.702
Actually, I'm not going back.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.371
Why wouldn't you be going back?

06:53.454 --> 06:55.456
I was fourth line, Mom.
They're not gonna miss me.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.499
But you love hockey.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.835
Hey, can I have a piece of your toast?
Thanks, bye.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.211
Already talked to coach about it.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.129
-It's cool.
-Hi, Mom.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.380
Bye, Mom.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.093
Don't forget,
Duncan's coming tonight for the weekend!

07:13.599 --> 07:16.519
Bode, you're gonna miss your bus.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.855
What were you doing in the shed?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.273
Nothing.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.483
-Did you get anything to eat?
-Love you, Mom.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.820
Love you, too.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.538
<i>Nathaniel! </i>

07:35.621 --> 07:38.040
<i>I can't believe you started the movie</i>
<i>without me.</i>

07:41.252 --> 07:44.005
<i>I hope I didn't put too much butter</i>
<i>on the popcorn.</i>

07:44.088 --> 07:45.715
<i>No such thing.</i>

08:00.855 --> 08:02.440
-Oh, my...

08:03.816 --> 08:04.817
I ruined it.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.861
What? No, no, no, no, not at all.

08:06.944 --> 08:10.531
Your performance actually
with the scream we added is wicked.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.618
You know, my blood
turned to cottage cheese.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.370
-It's the rest of the damn thing.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.997
Not what you were hoping for?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.540
Well, let's put it this way,

08:19.624 --> 08:22.126
if I was hoping
for a used car commercial,

08:22.210 --> 08:24.545
I'd still be cringing
at this mess.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.297
-It's just a rough cut.
-Rough?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.132
It's bloody sandpaper.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.469
Regretting your last-minute recast,
Kavandouche?

08:31.928 --> 08:36.807
Actually, no,
I was just admiring Kinsey's skill.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.184
Mm...

08:38.809 --> 08:42.146
A director blinded by the wannabe
he's sleeping with, how classic.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.439
Eden, go away.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.732
You know, it's such a shame

08:44.815 --> 08:47.068
that desire has nothing to do with talent.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.528
I hate to break it to you,

08:48.611 --> 08:51.614
but wanting to be a director
doesn't mean that you are one.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.701
You're just a pretentious,
mediocre little fanboy,

08:55.993 --> 08:57.912
and that's all you're ever gonna be.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.289
Mediocre being the key word.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.045
Leave it. It's not worth it.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.422
I've got track practice,

09:08.506 --> 09:10.341
but did you guys want to come over
after school?

09:10.424 --> 09:12.218
-We can sort out shirts.
-Yeah, sure.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.853
Hey, Logan, you think you could
come up with a reason

09:22.979 --> 09:26.607
why you, you know...
why you can't come to Jackie's later?

09:26.691 --> 09:27.525
Wow.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.361
If I'm not there, who'll make sure
the larges don't get mixed in

09:30.444 --> 09:31.862
-with the extra larges?

09:31.946 --> 09:34.490
You want some alone time with her?
It's cool.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.076
Starting to get the feeling
she wouldn't mind that either.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.369
Did she say something?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.372
Nah, we've just been friends
for a long time.

09:41.914 --> 09:42.957
I can tell.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.543
Doesn't happen with her often.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.461
What do you mean?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.173
You know, she's not like Eden or me.
you know.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.300
She's picky,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.218
and I guess she picked you.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.429
Don't screw it up.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.723
I won't.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.314
Hey, you're gonna have to find
another ride after school.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.523
I'm going over to Jackie's.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.609
What?

10:13.738 --> 10:14.739
I'm keeping it safe.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.325
Didn't you say to keep them with us?

10:17.408 --> 10:19.410
I said the keys.

10:19.785 --> 10:20.620
Sorry.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.039
Next time why don't you come up
with a complete set of rules?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.709
-Don't make me that guy, Kinsey.
-That's easy, then.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.128
Don't be that guy.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.302
That was aggressive.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.262
-You okay?

10:38.679 --> 10:40.306
I'm just sick of bullies.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
Well, yeah, I... I...

10:43.142 --> 10:46.103
I've come to accept them
as an inevitable part

10:46.187 --> 10:47.730
of the high school food chain.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.274
What, so you just accept
the way Eden treats you?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.819
I mean, it's like...
it's like air pollution.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.657
You know, you just don't really get
a choice in the matter.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.494
You know, we're not powerless here.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.497
We have certain tools at our disposal.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.793
Tools that open doors of possibility.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.212
-Oh!

11:11.671 --> 11:12.505
Oh.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.006
And...

11:14.507 --> 11:16.509
what exactly did you have in mind?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.890
-Is this a new one?

11:22.973 --> 11:24.684
Yep, found it last night.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.185
-Was it... does it...

11:26.894 --> 11:30.189
does it make any song you want
worm its way into the mind of your enemy?

11:30.398 --> 11:33.401
-That's an oddly specific guess.
-I'm right,

11:33.484 --> 11:34.318
though, aren't I?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.528
What song shall we pick?

11:35.611 --> 11:37.988
Maybe that Chumbawamba tune.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.658
This is better. Watch.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.841
Eden Hawkins...

12:02.221 --> 12:03.931
fall on your face.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.077
Physical comedy isn't easy,
guys.

12:25.828 --> 12:26.746
Think I nailed it.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.330
- Yeah, you did!

12:33.002 --> 12:35.296
-That was incredible.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.797
But she's not even upset.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.715
No way.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.553
What... Wait, how...
how did you just...

12:43.012 --> 12:44.430
Poor boy's short circuiting.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.224
Listen, Gabe, you didn't just see
what you think you just...

12:49.101 --> 12:51.270
-What do you think you just saw?
-I...

12:51.353 --> 12:53.856
I don't know. I mean,
I think I just saw you guys...

12:55.232 --> 12:57.276
puppeteering Eden Hawkins.

12:58.402 --> 13:01.071
-That's pretty accurate, yeah.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.657
This is some sort of prank,
isn't it? It is!

13:04.116 --> 13:06.452
How'd you get Eden in on it?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.913
Oh, no. There's no way
she'd have been able to pull that off.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.956
She's definitely not that good
of an actress.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.250
It's real, but you can't tell anybody.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.378
I mean, come on, you're telling me

13:16.462 --> 13:18.339
that you just talk into that thing
and then she--

13:18.422 --> 13:19.840
Does whatever I say.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.843
You just have to put the key in
and turn it.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.845
Okay, fine. Let me try.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.644
Eden Hawkins,

13:32.102 --> 13:33.729
-stand up.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.442
- Get on the table.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.612
-What the hell?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.871
- Make a snow angel.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.541
- Sit up.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.417
- Turn over.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.672
Do the breaststroke.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.027
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:25.030 --> 14:27.408
- What is happening to me?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.752
Holy shit! It's actually happening.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.754
-Oh, my God.
-Funny.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.549
-Wait, let's make her do something else.
-Here.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.552
-I think that's enough now, though, right?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.387
-Huh?
-What?

14:48.470 --> 14:52.474
What? No, this is incredible!
And Eden is just the empirical worst, so--

14:52.558 --> 14:53.934
Right, agreed. Yes, she is.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.604
But, you know,
I think we've better stop the poison.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.771
-All right?

14:57.855 --> 15:00.357
So let's just call it a victory
and go to class.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.071
-You're making dreams come true, and--
-Yeah, maybe, but there is a limit.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.698
Hey, don't touch it!

15:08.324 --> 15:09.158
Well,

15:09.241 --> 15:11.285
I thought that this was
about getting back at her

15:11.368 --> 15:12.870
for what she said to me.

15:12.953 --> 15:13.996
It was.

15:14.079 --> 15:14.955
It is.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.667
Okay, so I'm telling you,
Kinsey, I'm good.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.127
Leave her be.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.797
- Kinsey, please.
-Hey, she's getting up and cleaned up.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.007
It's now or never.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.102
This is messed up. You guys are nuts.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.483
Thank you for meeting with me.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.692
I just wanted to check in

15:43.776 --> 15:45.277
and see how Tyler is doing.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.530
This morning he told me
he's quitting the hockey team.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.367
-He's been skating since he was seven.
-Huh.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.995
Well, could be he's gotten busy
with the fundraiser now.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.872
Fundraiser?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.374
Yes, 5K run.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.584
For cancer research.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.254
He  didn't say anything about it.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.589
Yeah.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.467
I've been organizing it for years now.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.678
So, Tyler's helping me.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.347
He and some classmates.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.060
They've been working every day, you know,
getting donations, sponsorships.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.479
Happy to hear that.

16:21.939 --> 16:26.110
I just feel like he's gotten
so far away from me.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.404
Yeah, well, it's exciting to see

16:28.487 --> 16:30.739
how nimble-minded
teenagers' brains can be.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.617
They don't get stuck on any one idea,
they find other interests.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.954
But rest assured, Nina,
Tyler is doing great.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.999
I feel like he's moving
onto a brighter place.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.255
Oh, sorry.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.552
Hello?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.305
Yes, this is Nina Locke.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.227
I'm sorry, he did what?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.954
<i>I promise you're not in trouble,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:22.833
<i>But I need to know why you brought</i>
<i>a blacksmith hammer to school.</i>

17:23.125 --> 17:24.626
<i>For protection.</i>

17:25.085 --> 17:29.089
<i>Protection? From whom?</i>
<i>Who do you think's going to hurt you?</i>

17:30.340 --> 17:31.884
<i>You can't understand.</i>

17:32.926 --> 17:36.096
<i>-I wish you could, but you just can't.</i>
- <i>Oh...</i>

17:36.180 --> 17:37.473
I'll protect you, honey.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.851
Nothing's gonna hurt you, I promise.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.988
Come on.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.075
Would that be an eight ball app
you've got there?

17:57.159 --> 17:58.243
Maybe.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.996
What'd you ask it?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.581
I'm not gonna tell you that.

18:03.624 --> 18:07.795
Come on. I didn't tell anyone
you thought George Eliott was a man.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.214
I'm really not gonna tell you.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.092
Someone who would use
a common misunderstanding

18:13.175 --> 18:14.051
for blackmail?

18:14.927 --> 18:15.803
No way.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.680
-Fine.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.101
I don't think people should trust
fortune tellers anyway.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.685
Oh, really?

18:23.936 --> 18:24.770
Yes.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.731
I think fortune tellers
are for lazy people

18:27.815 --> 18:29.817
who let the world dictate who they are.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.861
If you want something to happen,

18:34.029 --> 18:35.030
make it happen.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.790
-Oh, my God.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.584
What is it?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.386
What the hell is she doing?

19:02.599 --> 19:05.894
Okay, this video already has
over 3,000 views.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.648
Eden loves an audience,
but why would she do this?

19:11.233 --> 19:13.944
-Something's wrong. I gotta check on her.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.446
-Yeah, of course.
- I'll text you later.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.997
Hey, take off your wet...

19:26.665 --> 19:27.499
shoes.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.441
- Hello? It's me, Ellie.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.401
Oh, Jesus, Ellie.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.154
-It's me.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.369
-I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.831
Rufus left one of his guys
and he was having a total meltdown.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.499
-I knocked but no one was home,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.376
so I just...
I used Rufus's key.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.546
Ellie,
you can't just walk into my house.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.924
You should've called me first.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.009
You're right.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.637
You're right. I'm so sorry.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.723
Um... I was just, uh...

20:25.766 --> 20:28.310
you know, when it comes to Rufus,
I think I sometimes lose my head.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.771
It's okay.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.069
What?

20:40.447 --> 20:41.490
Your scar.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.535
Sorry to stare.

20:46.828 --> 20:47.996
How'd you get it?

20:49.706 --> 20:51.833
I got it as a kid.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.921
I fell off my bike.

20:56.838 --> 21:00.550
First time without training wheels
and right into a bush with jagged stems.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.011
That must've hurt.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.763
Oh, it did, for sure.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.350
I gotta run. I'm so sorry again.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.644
I promise I'll give you
a heads up next time.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.187
Bye.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.027
- We've got a goddamn magic key!

21:19.111 --> 21:21.863
Hey, keep it quiet.
You weren't even supposed to know.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.158
I know. I'm sorry, but, I mean, I do know
and now I feel like I've got to know more.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.577
In my family,
we'd call this serious questions.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.997
-Ask away.
-Okay.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.999
Okay, serious question:

21:32.416 --> 21:34.376
-How did you find it?

21:34.918 --> 21:38.046
Guess you could say it kinda called to me.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.590
Mm-kay. Okay.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.302
Um... How does it exist?

21:43.593 --> 21:45.345
Like, how do you think it got made?

21:46.054 --> 21:49.099
My ancestors had a sick sense of humor?

21:49.182 --> 21:51.768
- Hmm. Or, hear me out...

21:51.852 --> 21:53.812
- Mm-hmm...
-...you're a descendant

21:53.895 --> 21:56.148
-of a coven of witches and warlocks.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.358
-Even better.
-Yeah, I like that.

21:59.234 --> 22:03.488
Hmm. You know, last I checked,
that Eden video had, like, 7,000 views.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.783
- Oh, she deserved it.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.536
I like to think of it
more like she earned it.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.539
Okay. Yeah, I like that.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.668
She put in the work and this was
her lifetime achievement award.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.423
So, why did you transfer
to Matheson Academy?

22:22.299 --> 22:26.678
Uh... I didn't. My parents moved me
from my day school in Philly.

22:26.887 --> 22:27.804
They're...

22:28.347 --> 22:30.807
- they're getting divorced.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.267
It is what it is.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.773
Yeah, you know,
my dad's always traveling and...

22:39.232 --> 22:42.819
my mom thinks it's good for me
to go to a boarding school, so...

22:43.445 --> 22:47.407
Translation: she gets to pretend
that she's, like, 25 again.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.744
-Anyway.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.913
For what it's worth,

22:53.372 --> 22:54.539
I'm glad you're here.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.793
That's worth a lot.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.586
Thanks, Kinsey.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.424
Oh, hey, what's up, man?

23:05.467 --> 23:06.551
We need to talk.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.763
Right. Okay. Um...

23:10.180 --> 23:12.057
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow then.

23:12.140 --> 23:12.974
Bye.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.310
See ya.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.072
Can you turn your anger down,
like, 90 percent?

23:28.698 --> 23:29.699
Give me the key.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.161
Oh, my God.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.664
Oh, I'm serious.
Bode's gonna hold onto it,

23:35.747 --> 23:38.708
because clearly he's far more mature
than you are.

23:40.627 --> 23:45.090
You used the key at school today
when I explicitly told you not to.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.217
Yeah, you did "tell" me.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.220
But I did it anyway. And guess what?

23:50.345 --> 23:51.638
It was awesome.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.432
One of the best decisions I've ever made.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.225
It's just... it's not smart.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.435
You're not my parent.

23:58.728 --> 24:02.816
There is a crazy, evil thing out there
who wants these keys.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.985
Yeah, but she can't take them from us.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.778
No, but she almost burned us all alive!

24:06.862 --> 24:08.363
Except she didn't!

24:08.447 --> 24:10.031
Put two and two together!

24:10.115 --> 24:12.159
If she needs us to willingly give her
the keys,

24:12.242 --> 24:14.786
-then she can't hurt us, can she?
-No, no, you don't know that!

24:14.870 --> 24:17.038
We don't actually know anything.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.417
Look, I'm sorry that you're still a slave
to your own fear, but it's not my problem.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.253
Exactly, it's mine,
because I have to keep an eye on you

24:23.462 --> 24:25.922
every second
so that you don't get us all killed!

24:26.006 --> 24:27.215
No, actually, you don't.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.801
I hereby relieve you of that burden.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.261
Go.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.556
Live your life.
Don't ever think about me again!

24:37.100 --> 24:38.810
- Jesus Christ.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.941
What's going on?

24:46.860 --> 24:49.488
Always good to be back.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.257
Hey, man.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.927
-You drawing?

25:12.552 --> 25:14.012
I'm mapping out the house.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.723
Cool colors.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.725
-Good scale.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.561
Is this what you were working on
in math class?

25:22.687 --> 25:25.315
I'm guessing Mom told you to talk to me.

25:25.899 --> 25:26.816
Perceptive.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.945
So why don't you tell me
what happened?

25:30.946 --> 25:34.908
Some things are more important
than doing math problems.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.369
Fair point.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.580
You want to tell me
what is more important?

25:41.414 --> 25:42.457
Mom,

25:42.541 --> 25:45.877
Tyler, Kinsey... you.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.090
We all need to be protected.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.551
Well, I certainly agree with that.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.178
I want us all to be safe, too.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.264
How can I help?

25:57.722 --> 25:59.474
You can't understand.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.687
-Try me.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.526
Do you remember when you were a kid?

26:11.319 --> 26:13.238
Sure. A little, yeah.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.992
Did you know Chamberlain?

26:18.952 --> 26:19.995
Chamberlain?

26:20.996 --> 26:21.830
Locke?

26:22.622 --> 26:24.040
The old guy in the painting?

26:25.792 --> 26:29.254
Well, no, he probably died
a hundred years ago.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.675
Well, I talked to him,

26:33.758 --> 26:35.760
and he told me that you and Dad

26:35.844 --> 26:38.722
used to play around with the magic keys,

26:39.681 --> 26:43.685
and you became ghosts
and you used to visit with him.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.062
Do you remember that?

26:51.234 --> 26:52.110
Wow.

26:53.653 --> 26:56.406
Magic keys.
That sounds really, really wonderful.

26:58.408 --> 27:02.287
Hey, look, kiddo,
tell me how I can help, okay?

27:04.122 --> 27:06.166
It's okay if you can't remember.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.376
It's not your fault.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.562
Nina?

27:27.937 --> 27:28.980
Can we talk?

27:31.608 --> 27:33.735
-Here we go.
-Thanks.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.321
-Of course. So...

27:36.655 --> 27:37.656
what's going on?

27:37.989 --> 27:41.409
Okay, I promise I'm not crazy,
so just hear me out.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.663
So, Rendell had this scar

27:45.246 --> 27:46.831
<i>right below his collar bone.</i>

27:46.915 --> 27:48.124
<i>It was really unusual.</i>

27:48.625 --> 27:49.959
<i>It was like, uh...</i>

27:50.085 --> 27:52.045
<i>the shape</i>
<i>of an upside down teardrop.</i>

27:56.591 --> 27:58.968
<i>He said he got it</i>
<i>when he burned himself camping.</i>

27:59.386 --> 28:00.387
Okay.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.430
And then, today, when I saw Ellie,

28:02.931 --> 28:07.727
I saw that she had the exact same scar
in the exact same place,

28:08.144 --> 28:11.981
but she said she got it
in a biking accident when she was a kid.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.361
I hear you.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.155
I just don't know what you're asking me.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.158
Well, you knew them both
when they were young.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.994
I'm just trying to figure out
how it's possible

28:25.578 --> 28:28.998
for two people
to have totally identical scars

28:29.290 --> 28:31.251
from two completely different things.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.044
And if it's not possible,

28:33.545 --> 28:34.921
what does that mean to you?

28:36.256 --> 28:37.257
That Ellie lied.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.259
Or Rendell did.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.304
Or they both did.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.018
Whatever happened, Nina,
it's way in the past.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.562
Then why lie about it?

28:57.569 --> 29:00.238
I could never get Rendell
to talk about his life here.

29:02.824 --> 29:06.077
I'm pretty sure the reason
is that something happened.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.538
I don't know what, but...

29:10.039 --> 29:12.000
when Sam Lesser came into our house,

29:12.542 --> 29:16.504
he said something about Key House
to Rendell, right before he shot him.

29:18.631 --> 29:22.427
Honestly, it's...
part of the reason I'm here.

29:26.347 --> 29:27.223
You know...

29:28.933 --> 29:30.977
right after Callie passed, I, um...

29:32.645 --> 29:34.856
I struggled for a period of time.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.610
I mean, I kept searching for something,

29:38.985 --> 29:41.529
someone, I could blame.

29:43.448 --> 29:47.577
At my low point, I even sued the doctor
who was just trying to help her.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.581
And at some point, I realized that fight

29:52.916 --> 29:54.083
was gonna kill me...

29:56.586 --> 29:58.213
and Callie wouldn't want that.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.883
I appreciate that,
but this wasn't cancer, Joe.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.677
This kid killed Rendell in cold blood.

30:06.012 --> 30:10.099
-You know, and those scars... I--
-Nina,

30:11.351 --> 30:13.394
it's okay to lose yourself in this...

30:14.854 --> 30:17.148
just as long
as you can find yourself again.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.693
And I'm always here.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.280
I'll help you however I can.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.203
I appreciate that, Joe.

30:31.287 --> 30:32.288
I do.

30:40.630 --> 30:41.464
So...

30:41.548 --> 30:44.717
it's all just
some performance art thing?

30:45.301 --> 30:47.554
I guess. She still won't open up about it.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.222
Hope she's okay.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.308
-I'm really worried about her.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.561
-You're a good friend.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.313
Wish I'd known you in Seattle.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.775
I would've guessed
you had a lot of friends.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.818
Thought I did,

31:01.901 --> 31:05.780
then all our shit went down
and everyone just sort of...

31:06.865 --> 31:07.991
disappeared on me.

31:09.784 --> 31:10.827
That's terrible.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.954
<i>♪ Didn't think I would be missing you</i>
<i>At all ♪</i>

31:13.830 --> 31:15.415
At least you had your family.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.709
-What?

31:19.627 --> 31:21.671
You all seem really close.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.424
It's just...  it's just like...

31:24.507 --> 31:26.509
<i>♪ You don't get under my skin no more ♪</i>

31:27.051 --> 31:29.888
it's almost like
I have to act like their dad,

31:30.638 --> 31:32.974
and... I suck at it.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.311
<i>♪ So you don't have to stay now ♪</i>

31:36.436 --> 31:38.688
Well, that's understandable.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.109
I mean, you're not their dad...

31:44.736 --> 31:46.112
but you're their brother.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.407
And you're a good one.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.995
Mm... Not so sure.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.955
Come on.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.625
You're strong.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.505
-You're kind.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.593
<i>♪ You couldn't wait to leave me behind ♪</i>

32:08.885 --> 32:10.970

32:11.971 --> 32:14.557
<i>♪ You couldn't wait to leave me behind ♪</i>

32:14.641 --> 32:15.975
You don't know that.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.061
<i>♪ Nothing you say will change my mind ♪</i>

32:18.269 --> 32:19.187
I do.

32:19.312 --> 32:22.523

32:25.902 --> 32:28.947

33:13.741 --> 33:15.743
-I have a front door, you know.
-Right,

33:15.827 --> 33:16.869
yeah, I, uh...

33:16.953 --> 33:19.664
I kinda always wanted to do
the pebble on the window thing.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.457
-You know, it's romantic.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.459
You should be impressed.
It's a pretty long throw.

33:23.543 --> 33:24.419
I am.

33:24.711 --> 33:28.006
But don't you think you could've just
maybe replied to one of my texts instead?

33:28.089 --> 33:30.675
Oh, yeah, no,
my phone has been dead for hours.

33:31.634 --> 33:35.179
If I use your front door,
can I use your charger as well?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.435
-So, I've been thinking

33:40.518 --> 33:44.272
and whilst I can't condone your actions
at lunch time--

33:44.355 --> 33:45.982
Look, if you just came here
to lecture me--

33:46.065 --> 33:46.941
Hold on, hold on,

33:47.025 --> 33:47.859
hold on!

33:48.151 --> 33:49.652
I know you were acting on my behalf,

33:49.736 --> 33:52.405
and whilst I can't condone your actions
at lunch time,

33:52.613 --> 33:55.533
I'm certainly not one
to be censoring the world of sorcery.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.826
So I have a proposal:

33:57.618 --> 34:01.080
how about we use your powers
for some actual good?

34:01.873 --> 34:02.915
Say...

34:03.416 --> 34:05.918
making a shit movie not quite so shit?

34:10.715 --> 34:13.051
We're not telling the rest of the Savinis,
right?

34:13.718 --> 34:15.053
Are you referring to Gabe?

34:15.303 --> 34:18.389
Well, he only knows about the one key.
Let's keep it that way.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.017
Roger that.

34:21.934 --> 34:22.810
Oh, wow!

34:22.894 --> 34:23.728
Is this...

34:23.978 --> 34:25.521
Is this you and your tribe?

34:26.022 --> 34:28.316
No, we just collect photos
of random toddlers.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.776
Funny.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.195
And how about these very tall toddlers?

34:32.779 --> 34:34.363
-My dad and his friends.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.118
Oh, yeah, yeah. These are who drowned
in the caves that I was telling you about.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.162
Yeah, I saw their picture
in an old article.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.122
It was him, him, and her.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.000
-How can you remember that?

34:46.834 --> 34:48.836
It was a picture pretty much
just like that one.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.338
What did the article say?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.048
You know, the usual.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.258
Great kids, full of potential,
and all that.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.636
Yeah, they'd literally just graduated,

34:56.719 --> 34:59.097
and they were at a party and...

35:01.182 --> 35:04.560
And I can't believe this is now

35:04.644 --> 35:07.021
just occurring to me,
but maybe...

35:07.563 --> 35:11.275
-Nephropidae devoured them.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.236
I'm kidding. I'm joking.

35:13.486 --> 35:16.197
Everybody knows
Nephropidae only kills for sport, so...

35:16.823 --> 35:19.617
You'd better get back before curfew.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.494
-I'll see you soon?
-Yeah.

35:56.028 --> 35:57.321
Hello, Mrs. Locke.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.406
Hey, Rufus.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.116
Is your mom here?

36:00.199 --> 36:02.910
I'm not supposed to tell strangers
when I'm home alone,

36:03.119 --> 36:05.163
but you're a friend, so...

36:06.038 --> 36:07.123
my mom isn't here.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.211
Please tell her to call me
as soon as possible, okay?

36:12.628 --> 36:13.504
I can do that.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.965
Do you want me to tell her
that you seem upset?

36:16.757 --> 36:18.426
No, not necessary.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.972
Hey, uh...

36:24.223 --> 36:27.018
did you get that action figure
you left at my house?

36:31.939 --> 36:32.773
No, ma'am.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.152
All my troops are present
and accounted for.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.239
Got it.

36:40.948 --> 36:41.782
Thanks, Rufus.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.763
<i>Nina, hi. It's Joe.</i>

37:04.180 --> 37:07.308
<i>Listen, I just saw something.</i>
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

37:07.892 --> 37:08.976
<i>Hey, I, um...</i>

37:09.435 --> 37:12.605
<i>Listen, I think I need to show it to you,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

37:12.813 --> 37:14.398
<i>I'm gonna be home all night.</i>

37:23.199 --> 37:24.867
Oh, come on, come on.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.332
Tyler.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.633
I've been waiting for you.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.550
Tyler!

37:41.634 --> 37:44.053
Jesus, Kinsey,
just give it a rest for tonight.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.348
Tyler! Look,  I know things
aren't great with us right now,

37:47.431 --> 37:50.851
-but I really--
-You told me to be done with you,

37:50.935 --> 37:52.228
so I'm done.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.772
I actually feel good for once,

37:54.855 --> 37:56.607
so please just stay out of my hair.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.277
Those kids that drowned in the cave
were Dad's friends.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.778
His best friends.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.863
Lucas, Jeff, and Kim.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.741
-They'd all just graduated.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.159
Dad never told us.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.163
Maybe that's why
he never wanted to come back here.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.083
Even if it meant abandoning the keys.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.256
You hear that?

38:24.468 --> 38:26.846
Seriously? You want to do this right now?

38:37.231 --> 38:38.524
It's coming from outside.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.987
- Shit.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.910
It's in here.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.830
Perfect.
This is going to be a fun key.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.711
You know, we can just ignore it.

38:59.545 --> 39:01.881
Ignore the magic
that's literally calling out for us

39:01.964 --> 39:02.798
to find it?

39:04.008 --> 39:05.634
Ever heard of a siren song?

39:10.431 --> 39:11.349
It's in here.

39:21.233 --> 39:23.110
-Wait, you're not actually gonna--

39:24.153 --> 39:25.363
Unbelievable.

39:36.123 --> 39:37.416
It looks like a starfish.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.505
That's clearly a flower.

39:44.256 --> 39:45.424
I wonder where it goes.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.552
Gee, maybe it's the, uh...
the glowing tree?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.847
We need to see what it does.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.140
Actually, we don't.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.061
- I want you with me.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.901
These keys, they're our legacy.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.906
And they're something
that connects us with Dad.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.035
I think that means they're worth the risk.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.749
And like you said,
the keys are weapons, too.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.128
If we're somehow gonna have to fight
this Well Lady,

40:23.045 --> 40:25.506
wouldn't it be smart for us to know
how they all work?

40:51.866 --> 40:52.700
Kinsey?

40:52.783 --> 40:53.617
Look.

41:26.859 --> 41:29.195
- That's Dad flying.

41:30.362 --> 41:31.238
They're memories.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.783
Like in the candy boxes in my head,
but they're in paint jars.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.578
Whose memories would be in paint jars?

41:47.922 --> 41:50.090
That's Dad and his friend Lucas.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.512
<i>Hey, Duncan,</i>
<i>what'd I say about snooping? Out, now.</i>

41:55.054 --> 41:56.680
They're Duncan's memories.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.275
<i>Okay, show me how it works.</i>

42:08.484 --> 42:09.318
<i>All you have to do</i>

42:09.401 --> 42:11.403
<i>is think about</i>
<i>what you want to look like.</i>

42:20.454 --> 42:22.122
<i>And that's what you chose.</i>

42:23.832 --> 42:25.125
Oh, my God, Tyler.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.127
You have to see this.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.129
There's a key
that can change the way you look.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.300
-What is it?

42:36.804 --> 42:39.431
- <i>No, Rendell! No!</i>

42:39.557 --> 42:40.641
<i>-No!</i>
<i>-</i>

42:40.724 --> 42:43.435
It's kids from that photo that--

42:45.020 --> 42:47.147
-The ones that drowned.
- <i>No, no, no!</i>

42:47.231 --> 42:48.482
<i>What did you do?</i>

42:48.691 --> 42:50.317
Except obviously they didn't.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.819
- <i>Rendell?</i>

42:54.822 --> 42:56.407
Memories aren't perfect.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.577
They're very subjective.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.869
They're often distorted.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.248
Does that...
does that look distorted to you?

43:05.916 --> 43:07.084
I can't believe this.

43:08.544 --> 43:09.545
This isn't Dad.

43:09.628 --> 43:11.589
He wouldn't even kill spiders
in the house!

43:11.672 --> 43:13.591
He would never do something like this.

43:17.011 --> 43:17.970
This is...

43:19.054 --> 43:21.223
This is why
he didn't wanna come back here.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.030
Joe?

43:37.448 --> 43:38.741
Joe, it's Nina.

43:39.450 --> 43:40.909
I got your message.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.011
Joe?

44:13.817 --> 44:14.652
Joe?

44:31.460 --> 44:32.795
Joe! Joe!

44:32.878 --> 44:34.838
-Joe!

44:41.595 --> 44:43.597
<i>Nine-one-one,</i>
<i>what's your emergency?</i>

44:43.681 --> 44:47.726
My friend's dead.
He's not breathing.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.978
There was a plastic bag over his head.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.022
<i>-</i>
<i>-Where are you now?</i>

44:52.272 --> 44:55.818
I'm at his house: 4020 Lowell Drive.

44:55.984 --> 44:58.487
-<i>We have officers nearby.</i>
