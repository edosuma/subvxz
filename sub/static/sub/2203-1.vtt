02:50.375 --> 02:51.957
Who are you?

02:52.291 --> 02:55.457
I'm your husband. Ben.

02:56.541 --> 02:57.957
What?

02:58.583 --> 03:00.415
We got married in 1999.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.124
That's 14 years ago.

03:03.375 --> 03:04.790
Uh...

03:05.083 --> 03:07.082
Christine, you're 40.

03:23.791 --> 03:25.624
You had an accident.

03:26.541 --> 03:29.624
It was a bad accident.
You had head injuries.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.665
And you have problems
remembering things.

03:33.666 --> 03:35.790
What things? What...

03:36.541 --> 03:39.665
Everything. You store up
information for a day

03:40.083 --> 03:41.999
and when you wake up
in the morning, it's all gone,

03:42.083 --> 03:43.874
you're back to your early 20s.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.499
It'll be okay.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.457
Just... trust me.

03:56.541 --> 03:58.082
- I'm scared.
- I know.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.665
I know, it's all right.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.290
I love you.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.874
I love you, Christine.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.665
We've been married for 14 years.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.165
We met during your last term at King's.

04:21.708 --> 04:23.124
You were doing an MA in History

04:23.208 --> 04:25.165
and we got married
a couple of years after that.

04:25.250 --> 04:26.999
I'd have been perfectly happy
with the registry office...

04:27.083 --> 04:30.457
but you wanted a white wedding.

04:30.541 --> 04:32.790
I hated every moment of it

04:33.250 --> 04:35.457
until I saw you walking down the aisle.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.165
Is every day like this?

04:39.208 --> 04:40.874
Is every day the same?

04:42.958 --> 04:45.790
That's just a list of everything
you might need.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.707
And where you'll find it.

04:47.791 --> 04:50.290
Aspirin, first aid,
sanitary towels, toiletries.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.207
Couple of things you're allergic to.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.957
And, uh...

04:54.041 --> 04:57.207
Well, it's a list of things to do.
You like to keep busy.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.249
"Pack bag."

04:59.333 --> 05:00.999
Today's our anniversary.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.124
I'm taking you away.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.624
- Tonight. After work.
- Where?

05:06.750 --> 05:09.082
That's a surprise.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.874
A nice one.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.874
You'll understand when we get there,
I promise.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.957
I love you, Christine.

06:25.583 --> 06:26.999
Christine?

06:27.083 --> 06:28.499
Yes?

06:28.791 --> 06:30.499
It's Dr Nasch.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.624
That'll mean nothing to you,
I know, but don't worry.

06:34.041 --> 06:37.040
We've been doing some work
on your memory. All right?

06:37.958 --> 06:40.790
Trying to figure out precisely
what's caused your problem

06:40.875 --> 06:43.165
and whether there's
anything we can do to fix it.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.499
Ben didn't say anything about this.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.707
I'm not certain that Ben knows.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.832
I don't understand.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.957
Christine, I want you to do
something for me.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.832
I want you to
open the wardrobe in your bedroom.

07:00.916 --> 07:03.499
Your wardrobe in the bedroom.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.832
We're looking for something.

07:13.333 --> 07:17.332
Hidden at the bottom of the wardrobe,
at the back, in a drawer.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.832
- What am I looking for?
- We're looking for a shoe box.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.540
- Can you see it?
- No.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.415
The right-hand wardrobe
nearest the bathroom.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.957
Have you found the camera, Christine?

07:43.833 --> 07:45.249
Yes.

07:45.416 --> 07:49.999
On the top, right-hand side
of the camera is a power button.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.499
I want you to switch the camera on.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.415
Now I want you to hit the "play" button
on the back of the camera.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.457
My name is Christine,
Christine Lucas.

08:01.541 --> 08:03.957
I'm 40 years old and I'm an amnesiac.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.707
Tonight, as I sleep, my mind

08:07.791 --> 08:09.040
will erase everything,

08:09.125 --> 08:10.832
everything that I know today.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.332
Everything that I did today.

08:13.916 --> 08:16.999
And I will wake up tomorrow,
like I did this morning,

08:17.083 --> 08:20.374
thinking that I have
my whole life ahead of me.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.915
And the truth is...

08:22.000 --> 08:24.874
The truth is half my life is over.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.624
Oh, shit. He's coming.

08:40.832 --> 08:42.082
Admittedly,

08:42.166 --> 08:45.124
this isn't a run-of-the-mill
doctor-patient relationship.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.332
Picking you up at home,
driving you to my office.

08:49.416 --> 08:52.207
Seeing you without
your husband's knowledge.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.624
Are you all right?

09:22.375 --> 09:27.040
I saw you in the park six months ago,
quite by chance.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.665
You'd been referred to me
by a colleague

09:28.750 --> 09:31.707
but I'd had absolutely no luck
getting hold of you. In fact,

09:32.291 --> 09:35.082
I recognised you from
your photograph in the file.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.749
I explained that
I was a neuropsychologist

09:38.833 --> 09:43.624
and that I was preparing a paper
on atypical psychogenic amnesia,

09:43.708 --> 09:48.207
and that I was prepared to treat you
on a pro bono basis.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.540
You agreed to give me
the telephone numbers

09:51.625 --> 09:53.165
you had written in your diary.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.832
I called you a few days later.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.290
You didn't remember meeting me,
of course,

10:04.375 --> 10:06.082
but you did consent to see me again.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.290
Later that day you told me

10:08.375 --> 10:11.040
you'd mentioned the possibility
of further treatment to Ben,

10:12.583 --> 10:13.999
who made it very clear to you

10:14.083 --> 10:16.207
you'd received extensive attention
in the past

10:17.208 --> 10:20.207
and it had done nothing
other than to upset you.

10:20.291 --> 10:21.707
After you.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.957
I want you to keep a visual diary.

10:30.791 --> 10:32.031
I've set the time and the date,

10:32.041 --> 10:34.499
I've put in the biggest
memory chip I can find.

10:35.125 --> 10:38.249
It'll allow you to hold on
to the previous day's memories.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.707
And even if the periods
before and after the attack

10:40.791 --> 10:43.665
remain blank, at least this will
bring some continuity...

10:43.750 --> 10:45.165
Attack?

10:46.333 --> 10:47.915
What attack?

10:48.666 --> 10:50.082
Ten years ago...

10:51.333 --> 10:53.207
you were found on an industrial estate

10:54.000 --> 10:55.582
not far from here.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.665
According to the medical report,

10:58.750 --> 11:02.957
your injuries were commensurate
with repeated blows to the head.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.957
No. No, my husband said
that I had an accident.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.624
I'm sure of it.

11:11.708 --> 11:13.665
I have a copy of
the medical report here.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.999
Some newspaper articles. Mostly tabloid.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.749
There's very little information
about the actual attack.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.874
"Left for dead"?

11:27.958 --> 11:29.832
Someone tried to kill me?

11:31.958 --> 11:33.957
Who? Who tried to kill me?

11:35.250 --> 11:36.665
No one knows.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.165
- What?
- No one but you.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.374
I don't think Ben should know
about the camera.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.957
It's your diary.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.999
I think it's important you don't feel...

11:56.083 --> 11:58.124
constrained by the thought
of Ben checking up

11:58.208 --> 12:00.124
on your innermost thoughts and feelings.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.915
If I don't tell Ben, how will I know
the camera even exists?

12:24.250 --> 12:26.749
You could hide it
at the bottom of your wardrobe.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.374
At the back.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.207
I'll call you in the morning
to remind you.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.415
Was that a yes or a no?

12:42.166 --> 12:43.665
I want to get well.

12:54.125 --> 12:57.082
? You still wanna be just friends

12:58.125 --> 13:01.999
? But how can we still be friends
when seeing you...

13:05.458 --> 13:07.915
? And there ain't nothing
I can do about it

13:21.708 --> 13:23.165
My name...

13:23.250 --> 13:26.082
My name is Christine Lucas.
I'm 40, 40 years old

13:26.166 --> 13:27.582
and I'm an amnesiac.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.874
? Get out my life why don't ya, babe?

13:31.166 --> 13:36.124
Tonight, as I sleep,
my mind will erase everything I know,

13:36.208 --> 13:38.832
everything I did today.
And I will wake up tomorrow...

13:41.375 --> 13:43.540
And the truth is half my life is over.

13:44.375 --> 13:45.790
And I...

13:53.791 --> 13:55.707
Oh, shit. He's coming.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.082
Christine?

14:53.041 --> 14:55.040
We've been married for 14 years.

14:57.416 --> 14:59.457
We met during your last term at King's.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.665
You were doing an MA in History.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.957
We got married
a couple of years after that.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.707
I still teach at a school
round the corner.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.290
I'm the head of
the chemistry department.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.624
What do I do?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.499
You stay at home.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.540
What, I don't do anything? I don't...

15:20.625 --> 15:24.999
I don't study? I don't work from home?
I just sit around all day?

15:25.291 --> 15:27.165
You store up information for a day.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.415
And when you wake up in the morning,
it's all gone.

15:31.666 --> 15:33.915
You're back to your early 20s, Chris.

15:39.250 --> 15:42.540
And tonight,
as I sleep, my mind...

15:42.625 --> 15:45.332
My mind will erase everything
that I know,

15:45.416 --> 15:47.499
everything that I did today.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.415
And I will wake up tomorrow,
like I did this morning,

15:50.500 --> 15:53.457
thinking that I have
my whole life ahead of me.

15:55.250 --> 15:59.082
God, without this, I would believe
anything that he says. Anything.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.124
That you had a car accident?

16:03.208 --> 16:05.332
I wonder what else he lies about?

16:06.625 --> 16:08.265
If we want to keep this
between ourselves,

16:08.333 --> 16:11.957
I can't risk calling on the house phone
when Bers home.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.249
Why is he hiding the attack?

16:15.458 --> 16:17.374
Perhaps it's just easier.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.040
- God!
- Sorry.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.415
I wish I wasrt so frightened
all of the time.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.374
Do you really think this is a good idea?

16:30.458 --> 16:32.040
There are plenty of
case histories of patients

16:32.125 --> 16:34.082
going back to where
they suffered trauma.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.249
Actually, it's very rarely effective.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.749
So why are we doing it?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.790
We're building trust.

16:55.833 --> 16:57.165
Hang on a minute.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.332
- Mr Nancarrow?
- Yeah.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.540
I'm Dr Nasch, we spoke on the phone.

17:02.291 --> 17:03.915
Dr Nasch, yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.415
I'll have to call you back.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.832
Careful.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.874
Got quite a fright when I first saw you.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.540
Here, just down here.

17:34.666 --> 17:36.207
That's where I found you.

17:38.375 --> 17:41.165
Would you describe
exactly what you saw?

17:41.250 --> 17:43.082
I don't know,
it was a long time ago.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.374
Well, just tell us
what you remember.

17:45.541 --> 17:47.040
I'd just come off shift.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.665
Miss Lucas was naked.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.415
- Naked?
- Apart from a sheet.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.290
A bed sheet or a plastic sheet?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.415
I'd have said if it was plastic.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.332
Where did I come from?

17:59.833 --> 18:01.457
You couldn't remember.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.415
You were very confused.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.457
There was blood.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.290
My blood?

18:09.750 --> 18:11.165
Where?

18:11.750 --> 18:13.124
Everywhere.

18:22.791 --> 18:24.790
What was I doing by the airport?

18:27.833 --> 18:30.790
Well, there are a lot of hotels
in the area.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.499
Dozens.

18:33.958 --> 18:35.957
Hotels?

18:36.875 --> 18:38.790
It would explain the bed sheet.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.957
I live here.
Why would I be staying in a hotel?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.207
All sorts of reasons.

18:52.166 --> 18:55.874
The medical examination
indicated recent sexual intercourse.

18:58.916 --> 19:01.082
There was no trace of semen

19:01.166 --> 19:04.999
or anything to help the police
identify the man you slept with.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.415
Was I raped?

19:10.458 --> 19:14.415
The police report suggested not.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.207
I'm married. I don't think
I would be the kind of person

19:19.291 --> 19:20.957
who would cheat on my husband.

19:23.916 --> 19:25.832
How do you know?

19:32.708 --> 19:34.665
Whatever happened that night,

19:37.333 --> 19:39.290
whatever I've done,

19:42.333 --> 19:44.165
I have to remember.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.124
I know I do.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.082
I have to, for us.

19:52.916 --> 19:54.332
For us.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.665
Chris?

21:37.541 --> 21:38.957
No.

21:41.625 --> 21:42.624
No!

22:23.458 --> 22:25.999
Christine, could you
open your eyes, please?

22:26.541 --> 22:29.290
We're going to show you some pictures.
And I want you to look at each one

22:29.375 --> 22:31.165
and tell yourself what or who it is.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.290
Go ahead.

23:11.583 --> 23:12.999
Are you okay?

23:20.083 --> 23:22.290
Some of the photographs
were taken from random,

23:22.375 --> 23:23.957
others from your file.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.290
This caused distinct neural excitation.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.915
Who is she?

23:35.750 --> 23:37.957
Did I have a friend?

23:38.041 --> 23:40.415
Of course. You had a lot.
You were very popular.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.540
With red hair?

23:46.250 --> 23:48.374
- Not that I recall.
- Called Claire.

23:49.625 --> 23:52.540
Claire? It doesn't ring a bell. Why?

23:54.375 --> 23:56.040
You're absolutely certain?

23:56.250 --> 23:58.707
Well, I mean, it's possible.
You had a lot of friends. Why?

24:01.458 --> 24:03.415
It's just, I, uh...

24:03.666 --> 24:05.082
I had a memory.

24:05.333 --> 24:06.749
A memory?

24:09.500 --> 24:12.207
Mmm, well, sort of. I guess.

24:12.958 --> 24:14.957
That's great. What kind of memory?

24:15.916 --> 24:19.249
Claire. She had red hair.
She was a friend.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.499
A good friend, I think.

24:22.208 --> 24:23.790
Well, I mean...

24:24.541 --> 24:27.624
I suppose you might have done, once.
Years ago.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.415
Claire...

24:31.000 --> 24:32.749
There might have been a Claire.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.957
A friend from college.

24:35.916 --> 24:36.999
There was a girl you were close to.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.665
I mean, she might have been
called Claire.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.499
So what happened to her?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.165
What?

24:46.875 --> 24:49.207
This isn't the first time
you've remembered Claire.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.499
I don't understand.

24:54.083 --> 24:55.790
It's not something we talk about.

24:57.166 --> 24:58.582
Why not?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.332
You drifted apart.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.040
Why?

25:04.125 --> 25:06.874
A couple of years after your accident,
she moved away.

25:06.958 --> 25:09.165
- Where to?
- Canada, I think.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.665
You think?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.332
Truth is it didn't really matter to you
where she went.

25:12.416 --> 25:13.707
You couldn't remember her
from one day to...

25:13.791 --> 25:15.749
It matters. It matters now.

25:22.166 --> 25:24.165
Don't say I didn't warn you.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.457
I keep them in my study.

25:45.250 --> 25:46.915
You hide them?

25:47.583 --> 25:49.207
They upset you.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.040
You hide a piece of my past from me?

25:51.125 --> 25:52.665
- To protect you.
- From what?

25:54.583 --> 25:55.999
She couldn't handle it, Chris.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.915
She couldn't handle knowing that
15 minutes after she left,

25:58.000 --> 25:59.790
you had no idea she even existed.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.374
After a while, she stopped calling
or even...

26:06.458 --> 26:10.624
- She wasrt the only one, Chris.
- How can I trust you if you lie to me?

26:13.291 --> 26:16.249
I live with you. With this.

26:17.291 --> 26:19.332
Sometimes, when the truth
is painful or complicated,

26:19.416 --> 26:20.624
I don't always have the strength.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.790
Usually I do, but not always.
I'm sorry.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.915
- So, what, you edit my life?
- This isn't just about you!

26:27.375 --> 26:29.124
Sometimes this is a question
of what I can handle

26:29.208 --> 26:31.124
and I can't always handle everything!

26:31.958 --> 26:33.457
Not every day.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.457
Sometimes we both need a day off.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.665
He's keeping Claire from you.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.290
He says he's protecting you but he...

26:50.083 --> 26:51.582
Don't trust him.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.249
Don't trust Ben.

27:21.541 --> 27:23.540
- Hello?
- Christine?

27:24.125 --> 27:26.082
Hello, it's Dr Nasch.

27:26.916 --> 27:30.457
You won't remember me,
but we've been meeting almost every day

27:30.541 --> 27:32.707
for the last few weeks... A camera...

27:32.791 --> 27:34.249
It's in a shoe box

27:34.333 --> 27:37.165
somewhere on the bottom shelf of
the cupboard nearest the bathroom.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.332
He's keeping Claire from you.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.332
He says he's protecting...

27:42.166 --> 27:43.582
Claire...

27:43.666 --> 27:44.999
He's keeping Claire...

27:45.083 --> 27:48.540
He says he's protecting you,
but he's keeping Claire from you.

27:48.625 --> 27:52.749
Don't trust Ben.

28:15.375 --> 28:16.374
Bastard.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.707
Are you all right?

29:17.166 --> 29:18.749
I'm pregnant.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.249
"When you
wake up in the morning, Pooh,

29:47.875 --> 29:50.290
"what's the first thing
you say to yourself?"

29:50.833 --> 29:54.582
"'What's for breakfast? '
What do you say, Piglet?"

29:58.958 --> 30:02.665
"I say, 'I wonder what's going
to happen exciting today?"'

30:08.416 --> 30:10.040
- We have a child.
- Chris...

30:10.125 --> 30:12.415
We have a child, a little boy, don't we?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.915
Don't we?

30:14.666 --> 30:15.482
Where is he?

30:28.958 --> 30:31.665
- Come inside. Come inside.
- No. Where is he?

30:31.750 --> 30:33.351
I can't talk to you
standing in the rain.

30:33.375 --> 30:36.874
Why are you hiding him from me?
Where is my son?

30:37.166 --> 30:38.915
- I'm not hiding. Come inside, please.
- Where is he?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.040
- Would you just come inside now...
- No, I'm not coming inside!

30:41.125 --> 30:43.999
Come here... Come here. Come here
and I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

30:44.083 --> 30:45.624
- Come here.
- Where...

30:46.041 --> 30:48.332
He died. We have a son
but he's dead. He died.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.874
- No!
- He died. Please.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.165
No!

30:53.250 --> 30:54.624
Chris...

30:54.708 --> 30:56.624
Chris, here. Come on.

31:04.291 --> 31:05.749
How?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.415
Meningitis.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.665
How old?

31:14.041 --> 31:15.457
Eight.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.624
Adam died about three weeks
before his ninth birthday.

31:37.666 --> 31:40.165
I keep these in the garage for safety.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.665
There are some things it wouldn't
be good for you to stumble on

31:46.750 --> 31:48.165
when you're by yourself, Christine.

31:48.583 --> 31:50.624
Some things it's better
I explain to you.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.832
This is Adam as a baby.

32:07.291 --> 32:08.915
That's my baby?

32:10.958 --> 32:12.457
Adam.

32:18.958 --> 32:22.540
He would have been
about three months old there.

32:22.625 --> 32:26.124
- When was he born?
- August 4th, 1999.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.374
Adam.

32:44.666 --> 32:46.499
Adam Thomas Lucas.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.957
Beautiful.

33:09.875 --> 33:12.082
"I am sick, please come home."

33:13.875 --> 33:15.082
Where was I?

33:15.541 --> 33:17.707
In and out of hospitals.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.207
- Chris.
- No.

33:29.416 --> 33:32.624
I can't do it.
I can't do this, I'm so sorry.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.707
Bers been
through all this before.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.915
His grief isn't new.

33:45.916 --> 33:47.665
But it's new for me.

33:53.916 --> 33:55.957
And it'll be new tomorrow.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.290
And it'll be new the next day
and it'll be new the next day

34:00.375 --> 34:02.999
and the next, and the next
and every day.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.415
Every day for the rest of my life.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.206
No!

34:43.541 --> 34:45.873
His grief isn't new.
Mine is.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.623
Mine is.

34:51.291 --> 34:55.040
This isn't new for him.
His grief isn't new. Mine is.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.207
Mine is.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.915
And it'll be new tomorrow.

35:05.041 --> 35:06.749
And it'll be new the next day

35:06.833 --> 35:09.499
and it'll be new the next day
and the next and the next

35:09.583 --> 35:11.082
and every day.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.415
Every day for the rest of my life.

36:21.125 --> 36:25.665
- Did you know about Adam?
- We've spoken about Adam.

36:27.416 --> 36:30.832
Maybe Bers right.
Maybe it's better I don't know.

36:40.208 --> 36:42.082
Can we just sit here a while?

36:45.583 --> 36:47.249
Of course.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.832
Should I tell Ben?

37:02.166 --> 37:03.624
About us?

37:05.958 --> 37:07.624
About the therapy?

37:21.541 --> 37:25.415
Was I a good mother?
I mean, before the injury.

37:27.916 --> 37:29.915
You were a wonderful mother.

37:34.958 --> 37:38.082
It must have been awful for him,
me not knowing who he was.

37:44.041 --> 37:45.957
You loved Adam very much.

38:07.250 --> 38:10.207
I understand why you would
hide this from me, I do.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.790
And you've probably lived through this
more times than you can bear.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.582
And I understand there must be days
when you say,

38:15.666 --> 38:18.499
"I can't,
I can't go through this again."

38:20.208 --> 38:23.582
But if you care about this marriage,
and I have to assume you do,

38:23.666 --> 38:27.040
never try to hide my son from me again.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.055
I'm sorry.

39:14.333 --> 39:15.832
Adam?

39:35.083 --> 39:36.332
Mike.

39:45.666 --> 39:48.540
Good morning, Christine.
It's Dr Nasch.

39:49.541 --> 39:51.957
I'm a neuropsychologist
at University College, London,

39:52.041 --> 39:54.121
and I've been calling you
every morning to remind you

39:54.166 --> 39:57.707
to look for the camera
hidden in the back of your wardrobe.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.415
You've been keeping a video diary...

40:00.916 --> 40:03.874
Get ready, then I can come
and pick you up from home.

40:12.291 --> 40:13.707
Mike.

40:13.916 --> 40:15.332
What?

40:15.416 --> 40:18.207
I'm not sure
but I think that's his name.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.499
Whose name?

40:24.166 --> 40:26.665
The man who did this to me.

40:28.416 --> 40:30.374
Come here.

40:31.625 --> 40:33.040
Come on.

40:33.833 --> 40:35.665
Come here, come on. It's okay.

40:36.458 --> 40:38.249
It's okay.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.540
You're the only one
who makes me feel good.

40:58.625 --> 41:01.165
I want you to feel good.

41:19.625 --> 41:20.665
Christine, I'm sorry.

42:07.625 --> 42:10.207
Christine, my name is Dr Nasch.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.749
- I know.
- How do you feel?

42:14.875 --> 42:16.290
Shitty.

42:16.666 --> 42:18.415
I only administered a mild sedative.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.457
Just something to calm you down,
not put you to sleep.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.499
- I remember.
- You were confused.

42:26.666 --> 42:28.165
We call it confabulation,

42:28.250 --> 42:31.290
your imagination filling in the gaps
in your memory,

42:31.375 --> 42:34.415
turning me into the man
who did this to you. Do you understand?

42:34.500 --> 42:35.915
Ah...

42:36.166 --> 42:38.249
- I want to talk to Ben.
- No.

42:39.541 --> 42:41.207
No, I just found something out

42:41.291 --> 42:43.171
and I need to talk to you about it
face-to-face.

42:43.666 --> 42:45.582
- Christine...

42:46.500 --> 42:48.165
It's about Ben.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.457
Who were you talking to?

43:06.875 --> 43:08.290
When?

43:08.958 --> 43:11.332
When I called earlier.
It went straight to voicemail.

43:11.416 --> 43:13.457
Oh, I was trying to call you.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.540
My name is Christine, Christine Lucas.

43:24.625 --> 43:27.290
I'm 40 years old and I'm an amnesiac.

43:27.375 --> 43:31.207
Tonight, as I sleep,
my mind will erase everything...

43:31.291 --> 43:34.207
This isn't new for him.
His grief isn't new. Mine is.

43:34.541 --> 43:36.207
You're vulnerable.

43:37.666 --> 43:40.915
Vulnerable patients often develop
feelings for their psychiatrists.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.165
It's common.

43:44.083 --> 43:47.582
What's less common nowadays
is when those feelings are reciprocated.

43:52.500 --> 43:55.207
We call it counter-transference.
It's unprofessional.

43:57.708 --> 43:59.665
Completely unprofessional.

44:00.166 --> 44:02.332
On my video,
I say that you're my only hope.

44:03.333 --> 44:06.540
I'm referring you to an excellent
neuropsychiatrist at St Thomas's.

44:07.541 --> 44:09.832
I say that we're making progress.

44:10.291 --> 44:14.874
Christine, I can't go on treating you.
It wouldn't be ethical.

44:14.958 --> 44:16.874
- Please.
- Christine.

44:18.750 --> 44:22.457
She works out of the university
department at King's College.

44:22.541 --> 44:24.021
- She's very good.
- I don't want her.

44:24.041 --> 44:25.832
I want you. You're fixing me.

44:27.416 --> 44:29.207
When I called you this morning,

44:30.375 --> 44:32.499
you'd already watched your video diary.

44:34.375 --> 44:35.915
You remembered.

44:38.541 --> 44:41.124
Yes. Yes!

44:41.416 --> 44:43.207
Unfortunately, what you remember one day

44:43.291 --> 44:45.540
you may not necessarily
remember the next.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.082
Even the most significant things.

44:49.708 --> 44:51.374
What things?

44:53.958 --> 44:58.207
Ben had you transferred
from the psychiatric hospital in 2007

44:58.291 --> 45:01.124
to an adult community care centre.

45:01.208 --> 45:03.957
I rang the administrator the other day
to arrange a visit.

45:04.291 --> 45:08.499
It seems your friend Claire
has been trying to get in touch.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.082
This is her number.

45:19.416 --> 45:22.957
The administrator asked
how you were and I told her.

45:23.041 --> 45:24.999
She became extremely confused.

45:26.416 --> 45:27.749
Why?

45:27.875 --> 45:29.832
Well, according to her records,

45:32.166 --> 45:33.749
Ben divorced you four years ago.

45:39.708 --> 45:42.124
Hi, you've reached Claire.
Leave a message.

45:42.541 --> 45:43.999
Claire, it's, uh...

45:44.083 --> 45:45.707
It's Christine Lucas.

45:46.583 --> 45:49.290
Um, I really need to talk to you.

45:49.375 --> 45:51.335
Can you call me, please?
My number is, uh, zero...

46:08.125 --> 46:11.290
- We're divorced, aren't we?
- Who told you?

46:12.375 --> 46:15.040
Who told me? No one.
I'm remembering things.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.374
- Really?
- Yes.

46:16.458 --> 46:17.915
- You sure?
- Yes.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.790
- You're remembering an awful lot lately.
- Stay away.

46:22.208 --> 46:24.249
Just tell me the fucking truth.

46:24.541 --> 46:26.540
Why did you divorce me?

46:27.708 --> 46:29.874
- Why did you divorce me?
- You want the truth?

46:29.958 --> 46:31.374
- Yes.
- I'll tell you the truth!

46:31.458 --> 46:38.832
We had a little boy.

46:39.500 --> 46:42.915
And he got very sick very suddenly
and we lost him.

46:51.583 --> 46:54.040
I walked away. I was in bits.

47:01.541 --> 47:03.457
I came back and I'm here.

47:06.583 --> 47:09.207
I'll never leave you, Chris. Never.

47:13.833 --> 47:15.415
I'm sorry.

47:50.833 --> 47:52.290
Hello?

47:52.458 --> 47:53.957
Chrissy?

47:58.250 --> 47:59.832
Claire?

47:59.958 --> 48:02.374
Oh, my God, Chrissy, darling,
is that really you?

48:07.083 --> 48:08.749
Yes, it's me.

48:11.083 --> 48:13.207
You call me Chrissy.

48:14.750 --> 48:17.415
I kept ringing the care centre.
Did they tell you?

48:17.500 --> 48:20.540
They gave me your old address
and all my letters were returned.

48:21.541 --> 48:23.290
Every day, every single day,

48:23.375 --> 48:26.457
I've been waiting for this phone
to ring, hoping it might be you.

48:28.125 --> 48:31.207
They, um... They told me
that you moved away.

48:31.291 --> 48:32.707
- Moved away?
- Yes.

48:32.791 --> 48:34.540
- Whatever gave you that idea?
- Um...

48:34.625 --> 48:37.832
Oh, my God, Chrissy.
I've missed you so much.

48:37.916 --> 48:40.749
- Oh...
- How are you?

48:42.541 --> 48:44.165
Um...

48:44.250 --> 48:47.415
Well, I can't remember a fucking thing
but otherwise I'm fine.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.582
- Where are you?
- Um...

48:53.333 --> 48:55.749
I'm at home. I'm with Ben.

48:57.125 --> 48:59.999
And I really need to see you.
Can I see you?

49:00.875 --> 49:02.457
Yeah. Um...

49:02.541 --> 49:05.082
I'd rather not come to you, Chris.

49:05.583 --> 49:06.790
Why?

49:06.875 --> 49:09.915
It's difficult to explain
over a phone...

49:10.500 --> 49:12.957
How about we meet at the Observatory?

49:13.875 --> 49:14.999
Um...

49:15.083 --> 49:16.790
- The Observe...
- In Greenwich.

49:16.875 --> 49:18.540
I could be there in an hour.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.582
Will you be okay?

49:29.833 --> 49:32.499
Yes, I'm fine and I'll be there.

50:07.791 --> 50:09.374
Chrissy?

50:11.833 --> 50:14.499
Chrissy, darling, it's me, Claire.

50:16.333 --> 50:16.833
Claire.

50:25.375 --> 50:26.874
Oh...

50:29.000 --> 50:30.790
I remember you.

50:37.875 --> 50:39.374
Yeah?

50:42.125 --> 50:43.624
Oh...

50:43.958 --> 50:46.290
I've missed you, I've missed you,
I've missed you!

50:46.375 --> 50:48.124
I remember you.

50:49.875 --> 50:52.290
I've missed you so much.

50:53.708 --> 50:55.124
Oh...

50:55.208 --> 50:57.540
- This is amazing.

51:01.583 --> 51:03.624
Was I a good mother?

51:03.708 --> 51:07.540
Oh, Chrissy.
Nobody was more loved than Adam.

51:08.083 --> 51:10.915
Ben used to rush home from work
just to see his little boy.

51:11.291 --> 51:13.832
Adam was so like him at that age.

51:14.541 --> 51:17.207
Even then he was just as handsome
as his daddy.

51:21.750 --> 51:23.957
Who did this to me?

51:27.666 --> 51:29.999
Things were tough.

51:30.916 --> 51:33.290
You were juggling looking after Adam

51:33.375 --> 51:35.374
and starting a new teaching job.

51:37.250 --> 51:38.874
You and Ben were arguing a lot.

51:39.375 --> 51:42.457
I said I'd look after Adam
two afternoons a week.

51:43.875 --> 51:47.832
After a month or so back at work,
you seemed to get better, you...

51:49.083 --> 51:51.499
You even started dressing differently.

51:52.333 --> 51:54.749
I didn't realise
what it was at the time.

51:54.833 --> 51:56.540
I met someone?

51:57.250 --> 51:58.832
I asked you.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.207
You denied it at first
but you knew I wasrt stupid.

52:05.750 --> 52:07.540
We had an argument.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.165
Eventually, you told me the truth.

52:10.250 --> 52:11.790
I didn't tell you his name?

52:11.875 --> 52:13.915
You wouldn't give me
any details about him.

52:14.250 --> 52:15.915
Did Ben know?

52:16.166 --> 52:17.874
Not until the police found you.

52:18.125 --> 52:19.999
Oh, Jesus.

52:21.125 --> 52:23.207
Oh, poor Ben.

52:23.291 --> 52:24.790
I had to tell him, Chrissy.

52:24.875 --> 52:27.499
I'd already told the police.
I had no choice.

52:28.208 --> 52:30.707
No wonder he keeps lying to me.

52:30.791 --> 52:32.415
Well, that's Ben.

52:32.958 --> 52:35.165
- Protecting you.
- Maybe.

52:36.333 --> 52:39.749
Or maybe he thinks we just can't
come to terms with the truth.

52:40.416 --> 52:42.136
I mean, he still lies to me
about the attack

52:42.208 --> 52:43.790
and he never talks to me about you.

52:46.083 --> 52:47.540
Well...

52:48.666 --> 52:53.249
There's a reason why
he doesn't talk about me to you.

52:54.291 --> 52:55.749
Why?

52:57.458 --> 52:59.457
After your accident,

53:00.375 --> 53:02.582
I tried to help out.

53:02.666 --> 53:05.332
You can imagine how hard it was for Ben
looking after Adam.

53:05.666 --> 53:07.540
I did what I could.

53:08.708 --> 53:10.207
We spent a lot of time together.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.582
One day, after visiting you, he just...

53:13.833 --> 53:16.499
collapsed.
He said he couldn't go on any more.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.582
I...

53:20.541 --> 53:22.457
I put my arms around him.

53:22.916 --> 53:24.832
We got carried away.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.582
It only happened once.

53:29.583 --> 53:31.415
I felt so bad.

53:32.333 --> 53:34.415
We both felt so bad.

53:35.375 --> 53:37.665
I decided I owed it to both of you
to stay away

53:37.750 --> 53:39.540
so I just...

53:41.458 --> 53:43.207
disappeared.

53:45.791 --> 53:47.374
I'm so sorry.

53:50.625 --> 53:53.540
Well, you can hardly blame us,
Christine, after your affair.

53:54.333 --> 53:56.415
You don't know how lucky you are.

53:56.500 --> 53:59.332
You have never known
how lucky you are to have Ben.

54:01.125 --> 54:03.249
- I have to go.
- Oh, Chrissy...

54:03.333 --> 54:05.415
- Ben will be home soon and...
- Please.

54:05.500 --> 54:08.249
- He'll worry if I'm not there.
- Look, just wait.

54:11.416 --> 54:14.582
Ben sent this to me
shortly before you separated.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.290
He asked me to give it to you
if you were ever well enough to read it.

54:23.208 --> 54:25.249
I'm so glad that you are.

54:25.541 --> 54:28.332
I don't expect you to believe me
but I care about you, Christine.

54:28.916 --> 54:30.374
A lot.

54:32.583 --> 54:34.249
It's all right.

54:44.583 --> 54:46.249
"My darling Christine,

54:48.083 --> 54:50.415
"I can't bear to say the words

54:50.916 --> 54:53.332
"but I have decided to leave you.

54:53.791 --> 54:56.957
"I've tried so hard
to find another way, Chris.

54:57.458 --> 54:59.207
"Please believe me.

55:00.750 --> 55:02.707
"You loved Adam,

55:03.583 --> 55:05.957
"even if you couldn't
consciously remember him.

55:06.833 --> 55:09.540
"He would run into your arms
and you would pick him up

55:10.291 --> 55:12.915
"and for a while, you sensed who he was.

55:14.291 --> 55:15.790
"Then you started to believe

55:15.875 --> 55:18.915
"that Adam had been taken away from you
when he was a baby.

55:19.583 --> 55:22.582
"Every time you saw him,
you thought it was for the first time.

55:24.916 --> 55:28.165
"I'd ask him to tell you
when he last saw you, and he'd say,

55:28.958 --> 55:30.707
"'Yesterday, Mummy.'

55:30.791 --> 55:32.999
"But you wouldn't believe him.

55:33.583 --> 55:36.749
"One day you attacked me,
grabbed Adam and ran.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.207
"He started screaming.

55:39.291 --> 55:42.415
"Later, I tried to explain
but he didn't understand.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.790
"He became frightened
to come and see you.

55:46.625 --> 55:50.124
"I left it a few days and then called
to find out how you were.

55:50.208 --> 55:52.415
"They said you were happy.

55:53.458 --> 55:56.332
"When I asked them
if you remembered us,

55:56.416 --> 55:58.165
"they said no.

56:01.041 --> 56:03.665
"I love you so much, Chris.

56:03.750 --> 56:07.457
"I love you more than
I love anything or anyone in this world.

56:08.583 --> 56:11.207
"But our son is only eight years old.

56:12.750 --> 56:15.082
"He's desperately unhappy, Chris.

56:15.875 --> 56:19.374
"And I just can't put him through
that kind of trauma again.

56:20.958 --> 56:23.582
"I want you both to be happy,

56:23.666 --> 56:27.040
"even if you can only
find that happiness without us.

56:28.125 --> 56:30.540
"Forgive me. Ben."

56:36.958 --> 56:38.915
I forgive you.

56:40.125 --> 56:42.207
Can you forgive me?

56:45.916 --> 56:49.290
You're my lover. You're my protector.

56:49.916 --> 56:53.082
And my life is nothing,
nothing without you.

56:56.833 --> 57:00.124
By the time you see this,
you will know everything.

57:02.750 --> 57:06.832
And you will know that there is nothing
inside me for you now but love.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.540
And the hope that we can finally
find a way to truly be together.

57:16.250 --> 57:17.790
Hello?

57:19.333 --> 57:20.832
Chris?

57:21.166 --> 57:22.665
I forgive you.

57:24.750 --> 57:26.999
Can you forgive me?

57:27.083 --> 57:31.040
You're my lover. You're my protector.
You're my... You're my everything.

57:31.125 --> 57:34.249
So by the time you see this,
you will know everything.

57:34.333 --> 57:35.749
You will know that there...

57:36.916 --> 57:38.717
No, I want you to watch it
from the beginning.

57:39.083 --> 57:41.415
What do you mean,
"you will know everything"?

57:45.458 --> 57:48.332
I've been seeing a doctor, Dr Nasch.

57:49.333 --> 57:51.082
For a few weeks.

57:52.791 --> 57:54.790
He gave me the camera.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.124
He's been calling me
every morning to remind me.

58:01.291 --> 58:03.082
Why would you do that?

58:04.125 --> 58:05.582
To hold on to my memories.

58:05.666 --> 58:07.346
No, I mean, why would you
keep it a secret?

58:07.416 --> 58:09.415
Because I wasrt sure
if I could trust you.

58:13.125 --> 58:15.499
- I know now I can.
- Are you having an affair?

58:15.583 --> 58:18.957
No.

58:19.041 --> 58:21.332
I know how much I hurt you.

58:21.875 --> 58:25.540
I know what it's taken
for you to forgive me and I...

58:25.625 --> 58:29.249
I understand why you left.
I understand everything now.

58:29.625 --> 58:31.207
Ben...

58:32.083 --> 58:35.874
You're so good to me.
I love you. I love you so...

58:53.000 --> 58:54.749
He did what?

58:55.250 --> 58:56.999
Let me talk to him.

58:57.083 --> 58:59.999
He, uh... He left.

59:01.375 --> 59:03.290
I'm going to call him.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.540
I don't think that's a good idea.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.082
Look, I love you both.

59:07.166 --> 59:08.874
God.

59:11.083 --> 59:12.707
I'll call you right back.

59:23.083 --> 59:24.915
Ben hit me.

59:25.625 --> 59:27.290
I, um...

59:27.375 --> 59:30.540
told him everything and he hit me.

59:32.500 --> 59:34.957
And nothing can alter that, so...

59:37.916 --> 59:38.957
Ah...

59:42.916 --> 59:45.332
- Hello?
- I spoke to Ben.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.582
He says he's been living alone, Chris.

59:50.041 --> 59:51.124
What?

59:51.208 --> 59:54.832
Ben says he hasn't seen you
for four years.

59:54.916 --> 59:56.624
Christine,

59:57.458 --> 59:59.457
describe Ben to me.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:05.249
- What?
- Describe Ben to me.

01:00:05.583 --> 01:00:07.124
What does he look like?

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:08.915
Is he tall?

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:13.124
Yes.

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.790
Black hair?

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:20.415
No. No, he has brown hair.

01:00:22.583 --> 01:00:24.540
Does he have a scar?

01:00:26.166 --> 01:00:29.332
- A scar?
- Yeah. He had a skiing accident.

01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:32.332
He should have a scar
across the right side of his face.

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:50.707
Chrissy?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.999
No. No, he doesn't.

01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:58.582
Ben doesn't have a scar.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:03.874
The man you're living with,

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.207
I don't know who he is, Christine.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.790
But it's not Ben!

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:46.165
Help me.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.457
I need your address, Christine.
I need to know where you're living.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:53.665
I can't... I can't remember.

01:02:01.166 --> 01:02:03.207
I'll be right out.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.207
Find out quickly
and I'll call you back on your mobile.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.082
Who are you?

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.165
I'm your husband. Ben.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.749
- Christine?
- Yes?

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:33.082
It's Dr Nasch. That'll mean
nothing to you, I know...

01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:34.832
We've been doing some work
on your memory.

01:05:34.916 --> 01:05:37.624
Trying to figure out precisely what...
Have you found the camera, Christine?

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:39.124
Yes.

01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:41.249
Watch it and I'll call you back.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:44.124
You're my lover. You're my protector.

01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.874
My life is nothing without you.

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:50.790
By the time you see this,
you will know everything

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:55.207
and you will know that there is nothing
inside me for you now but love.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:02.124
And the hope that we can finally
find a way to truly be together.

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:28.249
Hello?

01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:31.665
Christine, it's me. Is everything okay?

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:34.707
Everything's fine.

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:42.999
Ben?

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.582
Sorry, yes, I heard. I'm in traffic.

01:06:50.125 --> 01:06:52.415
Just wanted to make sure
you remembered to pack

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.165
for our anniversary.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.874
To pack?

01:06:57.958 --> 01:07:01.124
- I wrote it on the board in the kitchen.
- Yes, I remember.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.374
Ben...

01:07:05.666 --> 01:07:07.457
I love you.

01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:12.040
I love you, too, Christine.

01:07:41.958 --> 01:07:44.957
Dr Nasch, please come to main reception.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:47.332
Dr Nasch, please come to main reception.

01:07:58.666 --> 01:08:00.207
Dr Nasch?

01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.082
Can I help you?

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.915
I'm Ben Lucas.

01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:12.832
Oh, Mr Lucas. How's Christine?

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:15.749
How is she?

01:08:17.791 --> 01:08:20.332
Stay the fuck away from my wife.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.665
- Is this really our anniversary?
- Yes.

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:20.165
Our wedding anniversary?

01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:22.499
No.

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:25.457
It's a different kind of anniversary.

01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:00.374
Why have you brought me here?

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:26.457
I want you to remember.

01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:31.374
Oh, Mike,
I can't do this, I can't. I'm married.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:33.165
Oh, Mike, I can't.

01:10:33.958 --> 01:10:35.665
How about this?

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:38.166
Mike?

01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:49.749
Where's Ben?

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:52.124
Ben left you.

01:10:56.791 --> 01:10:58.332
I didn't.

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:00.665
I stayed close by.

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:04.582
Watching over you. Protecting you.

01:11:04.916 --> 01:11:07.082
- Protecting me?
- Mmm.

01:11:07.166 --> 01:11:10.665
While your so-called husband
left you to rot in a care home,

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.540
I watched you wither and die,
day by day.

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:17.040
I couldn't stand it any longer.

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:20.374
I had to get you out of there.

01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:22.707
They let you take me home?

01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:25.999
False documents and a fake smile.
I got you out in half an hour.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.624
Do you honestly think
I'd have got away with this

01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.588
if anyone else gave a shit
about you, Christine?

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:36.290
You know, this whole Ben charade
wasrt the point.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:42.499
The point...

01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:47.665
was to care for you.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:51.999
Was to look after you. Was to love you.

01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:01.790
I honestly meant to tell you the truth
but you were so distraught and then...

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:06.374
then the lie
just got bigger and bigger...

01:12:08.333 --> 01:12:10.874
You know what? I'm sick of explaining.

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:13.040
And I'm tired of lying.

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:18.665
That's why I brought you here.
To put an end to this.

01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:23.790
We're going to leave here,
not as Christine and Ben

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.499
but as Christine and Mike.

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:27.040
I can't keep doing this.

01:12:27.833 --> 01:12:30.665
Well, call Ben
and tell him the truth.

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:36.665
- No.
- Tell him.

01:12:36.791 --> 01:12:38.999
Don't be ridiculous. I can't do that.

01:12:39.083 --> 01:12:40.249
Then I will.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.624
If I were Ben, I'd want to know.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.124
Don't be a prick, Mike.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.665
You did this.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:54.874
No.

01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.790
No! No!

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.582
What did you expect me to do?

01:13:00.666 --> 01:13:02.665
I tried talking to you,
you wouldn't listen.

01:13:02.916 --> 01:13:04.707
I'd never hurt you.

01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:07.571
I hate myself for what happened.

01:13:11.166 --> 01:13:13.499
It's all right. Please don't leave.

01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:17.832
I'm scared.

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:24.415
Don't leave.

01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:32.332
Go.

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:34.707
Go, then.

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.332
Thank you.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:42.082
What did you have to go and do that for?
You see, this is what I'm talking about.

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:44.165
- This is what happens!

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.749
- God, I'm sorry.
- And will you stop fucking apologising!

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:54.665
I just don't want to be Ben any more.

01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:58.707
Nothing...
I've nothing to live for except for you.

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:02.915
Understand?

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:07.499
Please let me go.

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:10.582
No, we leave together
or we don't leave at all.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.250
Now...

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.582
No more guilt.

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:29.832
No more grief.

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:33.874
No more battles to fight.

01:14:47.541 --> 01:14:48.999
Now...

01:14:50.708 --> 01:14:52.457
You're free.

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:01.957
Come here.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:06.082
Come on.

01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:10.499
Come.

01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:20.874
Here.

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:28.082
Come here.

01:15:33.041 --> 01:15:34.582
Kiss me.

01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:44.874
Again.

01:15:56.833 --> 01:15:58.499
Forget Ben.

01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:01.249
He's forgotten you.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:04.374
You must forget Adam.

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.124
He's forgotten you.

01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:10.415
Adam's forgotten you.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:15.082
Adam?

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.290
My son is alive?

01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:49.790
Ah!

01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:58.624
We leave together
or we don't leave at all.

01:16:58.875 --> 01:17:01.082
- Do you understand me?

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.540
Let me go, please. Let me go.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.915
Ah!

01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:24.082
My name is Christine Lucas.
I'm 40 years old and I'm an amnesiac.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:28.332
Tonight, as I sleep, my mind will erase
everything that I know,

01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:30.915
everything that I did today.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.540
And I will wake up tomorrow
like I did this morning,

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:36.374
thinking that I have my whole life
ahead of me.

01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:40.707
And the truth is, the truth is

01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:44.457
I will never let anyone
take my life from me again.

01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:48.165
And I will not wake up tomorrow
thinking that my son is dead.

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:54.415
I will not.

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:25.832
Christine?

01:19:28.333 --> 01:19:30.832
Christine, my name is Dr Nasch.

01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:33.957
I'm a neuropsychologist.
I treated you for several weeks.

01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:40.332
But I'm not here today as your doctor,

01:19:41.375 --> 01:19:43.374
I'm here as a friend.

01:19:45.791 --> 01:19:49.290
You have two cracked ribs,
mild concussion,

01:19:50.041 --> 01:19:51.665
so you'll need someone
to keep an eye on you

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:53.374
but you're going to be fine.

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:56.332
Your friend Claire
is coming by this afternoon

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:58.665
to pick you up,
to take you home with her.

01:20:02.583 --> 01:20:04.332
Do you remember Claire?

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:14.207
Red hair.

01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:18.999
That's very good.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.207
And you're safe now.

01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:26.165
The man that did this to you
is in police custody.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.790
He's going to be in prison
for a very long time.

01:20:32.083 --> 01:20:34.332
Can you recall anything at all
about last night?

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.332
Christine, I've brought you a visitor.

01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:53.457
I'm hoping this may be the breakthrough
we've been looking for.

01:21:02.625 --> 01:21:04.499
That gentleman is Ben.

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:08.582
You were married
but you've been apart for four years.

01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:30.665
She's awake.

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:32.749
Thank you.

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:47.957
Christine.

01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:50.665
It's Ben.

01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:55.040
Your Ben.

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:02.749
If I'd have known
you were in any kind of danger,

01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:05.749
I'd never have stayed away.

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.499
I had to.

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:13.124
For Adam's sake.

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:30.082
He's our son, Chris.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.082
And he loves you very much.

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:42.415
We both do.

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:54.875
Hi.

01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:11.165
I'm Adam.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.457
Adam.

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:26.415
"When...

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.061
"When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,

01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:30.624
"what's the first thing
you say to yourself?"

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.790
"I say...

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:40.999
"'What's for breakfast? '

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:44.707
"What do you say, Piglet?"

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.499
"I say... I say...

01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:56.165
"'I wonder what's going to
happen exciting today?"'

01:25:04.041 --> 01:25:05.915
You remembered.

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.124
Oh...

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:13.708
Adam.

01:25:23.083 --> 01:25:23.831
I remember.

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:51.499
Adam.

01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.582
My Adam.
