- Taylor. Is everything
all right?

40:01.450 --> 40:04.480
- Well, my parents are fighting
over your settlement offer.

40:07.890 --> 40:11.190
- Ahem. There... there is no
settlement offer to fight over.

40:11.260 --> 40:13.530
Now that we can prove

40:13.590 --> 40:15.490
that the vaccine
isn't responsible,

40:15.560 --> 40:17.700
Bordoxx has no reason
to pay out.

40:22.870 --> 40:25.040

40:25.110 --> 40:27.270
They don't care about me.

40:27.340 --> 40:30.280
But you came to my house
and you sat with me!

40:30.280 --> 40:32.180
I knew you were on
the other side, but I thought,

40:32.180 --> 40:34.350
"At least she's a person."

40:34.350 --> 40:37.780
I was wrong. You're not.

40:40.090 --> 40:42.720
- I want you to get better.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.530
- Taylor...
- I have lost everything!

40:51.600 --> 40:53.930
My life is ruined.

40:56.170 --> 40:58.300
I have no idea
what is wrong with me

40:58.370 --> 41:00.370
or... or why.

41:00.440 --> 41:02.570
- Now that you know that
the vaccine didn't do this,

41:02.640 --> 41:04.910
you can find out the real cause.

41:04.980 --> 41:07.210
- Don't pretend like
you're on my side.

41:07.280 --> 41:10.350
You're a hot shot lawyer.
You could help me if you wanted.

41:10.420 --> 41:14.450
- That's not really what I do.

41:14.460 --> 41:16.260
- No, of course not.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.290
Your job is to...

41:18.360 --> 41:20.260
screw people over.

41:20.330 --> 41:22.460
Good, hardworking people.

41:24.470 --> 41:27.130
And you saw me and you thought,
"Well, she's just a sick kid.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.640
She'll agree to anything."

41:31.710 --> 41:33.640
How can you live with yourself?!

41:42.550 --> 41:44.920
My dad wanted me to be a lawyer.

41:44.990 --> 41:47.490
But after what I've seen today,

41:47.490 --> 41:50.620

for a CT scan,

need CT scans.
