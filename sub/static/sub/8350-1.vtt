00:24.190 --> 00:26.886
According to all known laws
of aviation,

00:26.960 --> 00:29.690
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

00:29.763 --> 00:34.462
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.968
The bee, of course, flies anyway

00:37.037 --> 00:41.201
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.660
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.855
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

01:15.608 --> 01:18.577
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

01:18.645 --> 01:19.976
Ooming!

01:20.480 --> 01:22.641
Hang on a second.

01:23.683 --> 01:24.672
Hello?

01:24.751 --> 01:25.843
- Barry?
- Adam?

01:25.919 --> 01:29.480
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

01:32.492 --> 01:33.823
Looking sharp.

01:37.397 --> 01:40.594
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.032
Sorry. I'm excited.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.094
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.605
A perfect report card, all B's.

01:47.674 --> 01:48.936
Very proud.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.873
Ma! I got a thing going here.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.606
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

01:53.680 --> 01:57.116
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

01:57.183 --> 01:59.743
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

02:21.708 --> 02:23.471
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

02:23.543 --> 02:26.944
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.412
Never thought I'd make it.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.972
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.244
Those were awkward.

02:32.318 --> 02:36.482
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.319
You did come back different.

02:38.892 --> 02:42.055
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.759
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.698
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.962
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.630
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.230
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

03:02.749 --> 03:06.378
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.716
That's why we don't need vacations.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.691
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.632
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

03:24.704 --> 03:26.137
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

03:26.206 --> 03:27.537
Hallelujah!

03:28.208 --> 03:31.473
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

03:31.544 --> 03:34.536
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

03:35.315 --> 03:39.843
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

03:40.553 --> 03:42.214
...9:15.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.183
That concludes our ceremonies.

03:46.793 --> 03:51.093
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

03:51.164 --> 03:52.722
Will we pick ourjob today?

03:52.799 --> 03:54.664
I heard it's just orientation.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.725
Heads up! Here we go.

03:58.137 --> 04:01.573
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.408
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

04:14.821 --> 04:18.017
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

04:18.091 --> 04:20.923
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.427
This is it!

04:24.831 --> 04:25.991
Wow.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.197
Wow.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.207
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

04:35.275 --> 04:39.575
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

04:39.646 --> 04:44.276
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.113
Our top-secret formula

04:46.185 --> 04:50.383
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

04:50.456 --> 04:53.050
into this soothing sweet syrup

04:53.126 --> 04:57.062
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

04:57.130 --> 04:59.291
Honey!

05:01.634 --> 05:04.068
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

05:04.137 --> 05:06.332
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

05:06.406 --> 05:10.137
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

05:10.209 --> 05:13.337
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

05:13.413 --> 05:17.008
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.590
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.195
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.503
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

05:42.575 --> 05:45.772
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.339
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

05:50.416 --> 05:54.443
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

05:54.520 --> 05:58.251
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.224
But choose carefully

06:00.293 --> 06:04.992
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

06:05.998 --> 06:09.126
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.931
What's the difference?

06:11.904 --> 06:16.364
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

06:16.442 --> 06:18.933
in 27 million years.

06:19.779 --> 06:21.713
So you'll just work us to death?

06:21.781 --> 06:23.009
We'll sure try.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.959
Wow! That blew my mind!

06:45.304 --> 06:47.829
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

06:47.907 --> 06:51.240
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

06:51.310 --> 06:54.643
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.740
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

06:57.817 --> 07:00.308
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

07:00.386 --> 07:03.378
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.986
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

07:09.061 --> 07:11.052
Like what? Give me one example.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.262
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

07:20.673 --> 07:23.767
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.708
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.076
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.784
I've never seen them this close.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.193
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.026
Yeah, but some don't come back.

07:46.098 --> 07:47.690
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

08:10.723 --> 08:12.816
You guys did great!

08:12.892 --> 08:17.329
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

08:17.396 --> 08:19.830
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.332
Their day's not planned.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.927
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.997
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

08:29.408 --> 08:30.739
Right.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.611
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

08:35.681 --> 08:39.173
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

08:39.251 --> 08:44.952
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.686
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.421
Distant. Distant.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.827
Look at these two.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.867
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.266
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

08:57.336 --> 09:00.362
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

09:00.439 --> 09:04.068
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

09:04.143 --> 09:06.634
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.646
What were you doing during this?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.443
Trying to alert the authorities.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.211
I can autograph that.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.220
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

09:15.288 --> 09:16.550
Yeah. Gusty.

09:16.622 --> 09:20.080
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

09:20.159 --> 09:21.683
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

09:21.761 --> 09:25.197
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.198
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

09:27.266 --> 09:29.860
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

09:31.437 --> 09:34.531
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

09:34.840 --> 09:39.004
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.785
Hey, Honex!

09:49.855 --> 09:52.119
Dad, you surprised me.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.455
You decide what you're interested in?

09:54.527 --> 09:57.690
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.127
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.191
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.137
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

10:07.206 --> 10:10.573
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.975
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

10:13.045 --> 10:16.446
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

10:16.515 --> 10:19.279
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

10:19.352 --> 10:21.752
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

10:21.821 --> 10:25.052
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

10:25.124 --> 10:29.117
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

10:29.195 --> 10:32.687
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

10:32.765 --> 10:35.666
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

10:35.735 --> 10:37.464
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

10:37.536 --> 10:40.630
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

10:40.706 --> 10:42.731
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

10:42.808 --> 10:45.902
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

10:45.978 --> 10:50.347
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

10:50.416 --> 10:51.815
I'm so proud.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.585
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.822
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.261
Yeah, right.

11:05.331 --> 11:10.132
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

11:10.202 --> 11:13.296
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

11:13.372 --> 11:16.273
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.434
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

11:19.512 --> 11:20.672
Wow!

11:20.746 --> 11:22.111
Oouple of newbies?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.615
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

11:24.684 --> 11:25.912
Make your choice.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.284
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.119
Oh, my. What's available?

11:32.191 --> 11:35.160
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

11:35.227 --> 11:39.163
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.660
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.259
Wax monkey's always open.

11:45.137 --> 11:47.401
The Krelman opened up again.

11:47.473 --> 11:48.462
What happened?

11:48.541 --> 11:52.136
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.042
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

11:54.113 --> 11:57.480
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.711
Oh, this is so hard!

12:00.586 --> 12:03.054
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

12:03.122 --> 12:07.354
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

12:07.426 --> 12:10.827
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.561
Barry!

12:13.365 --> 12:17.199
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

12:17.269 --> 12:19.100
What happened to you?
Where are you?

12:19.171 --> 12:21.537
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

12:21.607 --> 12:23.199
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

12:23.275 --> 12:25.971
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

12:26.045 --> 12:28.536
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

12:28.614 --> 12:30.275
Another call coming in.

12:30.950 --> 12:35.046
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

12:35.121 --> 12:37.555
that gets their roses today.

12:37.623 --> 12:38.783
Hey, guys.

12:38.858 --> 12:42.055
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

12:42.128 --> 12:44.392
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.556
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.532
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

12:49.135 --> 12:52.070
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.662
- Thank you.
- OK.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.570
You got a rain advisory today,

12:55.641 --> 12:59.702
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.407
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

13:02.648 --> 13:06.140
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

13:06.218 --> 13:10.086
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

13:10.156 --> 13:14.820
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

13:15.094 --> 13:17.858
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

13:17.930 --> 13:21.923
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

13:22.001 --> 13:24.162
All right, launch positions!

13:25.337 --> 13:30.172
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

13:31.343 --> 13:32.935
Black and yellow!

13:33.012 --> 13:34.172
Hello!

13:35.581 --> 13:37.481
You ready for this, hot shot?

13:37.550 --> 13:39.381
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.941
Wind, check.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.045
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.613
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.659
Scared out of my shorts, check.

13:47.726 --> 13:49.785
OK, ladies,

13:49.862 --> 13:51.693
let's move it out!

14:00.706 --> 14:05.040
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

14:05.377 --> 14:09.643
All of you, drain those flowers!

14:25.965 --> 14:28.399
Wow! I'm out!

14:28.901 --> 14:31.062
I can't believe I'm out!

14:32.738 --> 14:34.399
So blue.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.912
I feel so fast and free!

14:45.417 --> 14:46.748
Box kite!

14:48.320 --> 14:49.412
Wow!

15:04.770 --> 15:06.761
Flowers!

15:11.944 --> 15:14.310
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.405
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.506
Roses!

15:17.583 --> 15:20.381
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.561
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.569
That is one nectar collector!

15:44.543 --> 15:46.773
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

15:47.012 --> 15:51.642
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

15:51.717 --> 15:55.016
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.812
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

15:57.890 --> 16:02.725
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.921
Oool.

16:25.150 --> 16:29.246
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

16:30.389 --> 16:31.583
Oopy that visual.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.319
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

16:34.393 --> 16:36.918
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

16:37.162 --> 16:38.493
Affirmative.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.606
That was on the line!

16:50.676 --> 16:53.270
This is the coolest. What is it?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.939
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

16:56.015 --> 17:00.111
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.777
Yeah, fuzzy.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.617
Ohemical-y.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.849
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.118
My sweet lord of bees!

17:09.194 --> 17:11.185
Oandy-brain, get off there!

17:11.530 --> 17:13.020
Problem!

17:15.768 --> 17:17.702
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.964
Affirmative.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.868
Very close.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.204
Gonna hurt.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.569
Mama's little boy.

17:25.644 --> 17:27.544
You are way out of position, rookie!

17:30.549 --> 17:32.881
Ooming in at you like a missile!

17:36.221 --> 17:38.451
Help me!

17:39.892 --> 17:41.723
I don't think these are flowers.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.319
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.727
What is this?!

17:50.469 --> 17:51.834
Match point!

17:51.904 --> 17:56.898
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

18:05.584 --> 18:06.915
Yowser!

18:35.547 --> 18:36.741
Gross.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.454
There's a bee in the car!

18:46.391 --> 18:48.018
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

18:48.093 --> 18:49.924
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

18:49.995 --> 18:51.724
He's going to sting me!

18:59.638 --> 19:04.234
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

19:05.310 --> 19:06.743
He blinked!

19:06.812 --> 19:07.836
Spray him, Granny!

19:07.913 --> 19:09.403
What are you doing?!

19:17.489 --> 19:21.152
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.484
I gotta get home.

19:33.238 --> 19:37.931
Oan't fly in rain.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.011
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

19:53.125 --> 19:55.626
Ken, could you close
the window please?

19:55.694 --> 19:59.357
Oheck out my new résumé.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.228
You see? Folds out.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.700
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.369
What was that?

20:08.440 --> 20:12.035
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

20:12.377 --> 20:14.072
Drapes!

20:14.146 --> 20:16.137
That is diabolical.

20:16.215 --> 20:21.152
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.085
What's number one? Star Wars?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.622
Nah, I don't go for that...

20:26.558 --> 20:27.889
...kind of stuff.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.895
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

20:30.963 --> 20:35.195
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.395
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.964
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.175
I predicted global warming.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.082
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.415
Wait! Stop! Bee!

20:59.424 --> 21:02.325
Stand back. These are winter boots.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.186
Wait!

21:06.598 --> 21:07.792
Don't kill him!

21:07.866 --> 21:10.926
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

21:11.003 --> 21:13.767
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

21:14.273 --> 21:19.370
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

21:19.444 --> 21:24.438
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.941
My brochure!

21:42.467 --> 21:44.128
There you go, little guy.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.038
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.577
Put that on your résumé brochure.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.579
My whole face could puff up.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.638
Make it one of your special skills.

21:57.716 --> 22:01.049
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.756
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

22:05.824 --> 22:09.419
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.655
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.994
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

22:20.439 --> 22:21.963
I gotta say something.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.732
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.741
All right, here it goes.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.852
Nah.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.198
What would I say?

22:52.871 --> 22:55.032
I could really get in trouble.

22:56.975 --> 23:00.308
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.210
I can't believe I'm doing this.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.371
I've got to.

23:04.449 --> 23:06.713
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

23:07.886 --> 23:09.649
No. Yes. No.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.712
Do it. I can't.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.285
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

23:16.361 --> 23:19.489
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

23:19.564 --> 23:21.327
Hi!

23:21.400 --> 23:22.992
I'm sorry.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.502
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.832
You're talking!

23:26.905 --> 23:28.236
I'm so sorry.

23:28.306 --> 23:31.503
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.703
But I don't recall going to bed.

23:33.779 --> 23:36.873
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

23:36.948 --> 23:41.749
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

23:41.820 --> 23:45.381
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

23:45.457 --> 23:47.516
but they were all trying to kill me.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.924
And if it wasn't for you...

23:49.995 --> 23:52.395
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.661
That was a little weird.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.726
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

23:58.804 --> 24:02.570
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

24:02.641 --> 24:05.439
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.843
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

24:08.914 --> 24:11.382
The talking thing.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.716
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey. " You pick it up.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.220
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

24:17.289 --> 24:21.589
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

24:21.660 --> 24:22.718
Anyway...

24:22.794 --> 24:24.091
Oan I...

24:24.763 --> 24:26.594
...get you something?
- Like what?

24:26.665 --> 24:31.068
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.468
I don't want to put you out.

24:33.538 --> 24:35.802
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.933
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

24:38.009 --> 24:41.069
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.443
Hey, you want rum cake?

24:42.514 --> 24:43.947
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.279
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

24:46.351 --> 24:48.546
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.451
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

24:50.522 --> 24:51.614
You look great!

24:51.690 --> 24:54.386
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

24:54.693 --> 24:55.682
Are you all right?

24:56.194 --> 24:57.525
No.

24:59.197 --> 25:03.395
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

25:03.468 --> 25:05.402
He finally gets there.

25:05.470 --> 25:09.133
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

25:09.207 --> 25:13.303
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

25:13.378 --> 25:15.608
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

25:21.219 --> 25:24.017
Is that a bee joke?

25:24.089 --> 25:25.613
That's the kind of stuff we do.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.658
Yeah, different.

25:27.726 --> 25:30.752
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

25:30.829 --> 25:32.820
About work? I don't know.

25:32.898 --> 25:37.358
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

25:37.435 --> 25:38.766
I know how you feel.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.771
- You do?
- Sure.

25:40.839 --> 25:45.299
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.175
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

25:48.246 --> 25:51.909
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

25:52.851 --> 25:55.513
Anyway, if you look...

25:55.587 --> 25:58.351
There's my hive right there. See it?

25:58.423 --> 26:00.118
You're in Sheep Meadow!

26:00.191 --> 26:02.853
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

26:02.928 --> 26:07.695
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

26:07.766 --> 26:10.599
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

26:10.669 --> 26:14.127
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

26:14.205 --> 26:17.936
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

26:18.009 --> 26:20.239
Just having two cups of coffee!

26:33.091 --> 26:36.117
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

26:36.194 --> 26:37.388
Yeah, it's no trouble.

26:37.462 --> 26:41.296
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.960
Are you?

26:43.768 --> 26:46.669
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

26:46.738 --> 26:49.764
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.172
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.544
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.106
Or not.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.078
OK, Barry.

27:01.152 --> 27:04.144
And thank you
so much again... for before.

27:04.222 --> 27:06.190
Oh, that? That was nothing.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.987
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

27:30.215 --> 27:32.046
This can't possibly work.

27:32.117 --> 27:34.711
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

27:34.786 --> 27:37.050
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.323
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

27:42.394 --> 27:45.329
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.991
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

27:48.066 --> 27:50.660
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

27:50.735 --> 27:52.896
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.735
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

27:55.807 --> 27:59.641
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.269
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

28:01.346 --> 28:05.510
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

28:05.583 --> 28:10.020
You had your "experience. " Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.749
- Well...
- Well?

28:11.823 --> 28:13.120
Well, I met someone.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.523
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

28:15.593 --> 28:18.858
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

28:18.930 --> 28:21.262
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

28:21.332 --> 28:24.529
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

28:24.602 --> 28:25.933
I can't get by that face.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.629
So who is she?

28:28.707 --> 28:31.767
She's... human.

28:31.843 --> 28:35.711
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.881
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

28:37.949 --> 28:40.884
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

28:40.952 --> 28:43.716
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

28:43.955 --> 28:45.320
We're not dating.

28:45.390 --> 28:49.451
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

28:49.527 --> 28:53.156
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

28:53.231 --> 28:57.224
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.462
This is over!

28:58.536 --> 29:00.026
Eat this.

29:00.105 --> 29:02.801
This is not over! What was that?

29:02.874 --> 29:05.342
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

29:05.410 --> 29:08.902
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

29:08.980 --> 29:10.914
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

29:10.982 --> 29:14.349
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

29:14.419 --> 29:15.477
Sit down!

29:15.553 --> 29:17.487
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

29:17.555 --> 29:21.582
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

29:21.659 --> 29:24.924
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

29:24.996 --> 29:27.760
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

29:27.832 --> 29:32.098
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

29:32.170 --> 29:33.933
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

29:34.005 --> 29:38.374
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

29:39.911 --> 29:42.106
There he is. He's in the pool.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.580
You know what your problem is, Barry?

29:44.649 --> 29:46.674
I gotta start thinking bee?

29:46.751 --> 29:48.685
How much longer will this go on?

29:48.753 --> 29:51.745
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

29:51.823 --> 29:54.587
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

29:54.659 --> 29:58.891
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

29:58.963 --> 30:01.397
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

30:01.466 --> 30:04.333
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

30:04.402 --> 30:06.267
Martin, would you talk to him?

30:06.337 --> 30:08.032
Barry, I'm talking to you!

30:36.234 --> 30:37.826
You coming?

30:37.902 --> 30:39.733
Got everything?

30:40.071 --> 30:41.902
All set!

30:41.973 --> 30:43.304
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

30:43.374 --> 30:44.966
Don't be too long.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.752
Watch this!

31:13.104 --> 31:14.765
Vanessa!

31:17.575 --> 31:20.373
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.538
He doesn't respond to yelling!

31:22.614 --> 31:24.775
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

31:24.849 --> 31:26.476
I'm not listening to this.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.711
Sorry, I've gotta go.

31:27.785 --> 31:30.219
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

31:30.288 --> 31:33.018
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

31:33.091 --> 31:34.183
Bye.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.523
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.966
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

31:44.035 --> 31:48.563
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

31:48.640 --> 31:53.077
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

31:53.144 --> 31:56.545
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

31:56.981 --> 32:01.418
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

32:01.486 --> 32:04.751
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.586
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

32:07.659 --> 32:11.095
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

32:11.162 --> 32:12.823
You don't have that?

32:12.897 --> 32:16.833
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.232
Oh, my.

32:18.903 --> 32:20.427
Dumb bees!

32:20.505 --> 32:23.736
You must want to sting all those jerks.

32:23.808 --> 32:26.868
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.436
So you have to watch your temper.

32:29.514 --> 32:32.847
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

32:32.917 --> 32:36.853
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

32:36.921 --> 32:40.482
Anger, jealousy, lust.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.725
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

32:43.795 --> 32:45.023
Yeah.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.394
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.902
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

32:51.970 --> 32:54.200
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

32:54.272 --> 32:56.570
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

32:56.641 --> 33:00.543
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.704
You've really got that
down to a science.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.772
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

33:05.850 --> 33:09.377
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

33:09.454 --> 33:12.821
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

33:12.890 --> 33:15.825
Ray Liotta Private Select?

33:16.394 --> 33:18.760
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.663
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.826
You don't have
enough food of your own?

33:23.901 --> 33:26.495
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

33:26.571 --> 33:29.404
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

33:29.474 --> 33:31.339
And it's hard to make it!

33:31.409 --> 33:35.175
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

33:35.246 --> 33:37.544
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

33:37.615 --> 33:38.946
It's just honey, Barry.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.609
Just what?!

33:40.685 --> 33:44.348
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

33:44.422 --> 33:48.358
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

33:49.193 --> 33:52.060
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.360
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

34:01.039 --> 34:02.529
Hey, Hector.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.041
- You almost done?
- Almost.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.610
He is here. I sense it.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.659
Well, I guess I'll go home now

34:22.726 --> 34:26.993
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.896
You're busted, box boy!

34:29.900 --> 34:32.563
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

34:32.637 --> 34:35.504
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

34:35.572 --> 34:38.667
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

34:38.743 --> 34:41.337
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.074
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

34:44.581 --> 34:47.176
You're too late! It's ours now!

34:47.251 --> 34:49.844
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

34:49.920 --> 34:53.254
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

34:53.324 --> 34:55.417
Where is the honey coming from?

34:57.261 --> 34:58.956
Tell me where!

34:59.030 --> 35:01.555
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

35:25.123 --> 35:26.215
Orazy person!

36:01.826 --> 36:04.590
What horrible thing has happened here?

36:04.662 --> 36:08.063
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

36:08.132 --> 36:10.862
they're on the road to nowhere!

36:10.935 --> 36:12.664
Just keep still.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.261
What? You're not dead?

36:14.505 --> 36:18.407
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

36:18.476 --> 36:21.502
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

36:21.579 --> 36:25.948
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

36:26.017 --> 36:27.951
I'm going to Tacoma.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.112
- And you?
- He really is dead.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.450
All right.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.716
Uh-oh!

36:32.790 --> 36:34.758
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

36:34.825 --> 36:36.816
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

36:36.894 --> 36:39.556
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

36:39.630 --> 36:43.896
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

36:43.968 --> 36:46.129
How much do you people need to see?!

36:46.204 --> 36:49.264
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

36:49.340 --> 36:52.537
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.170
But don't kill no more bugs!

36:57.515 --> 37:00.006
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!

37:08.993 --> 37:10.790
- You hear something?
- Like what?

37:10.861 --> 37:12.192
Like tiny screaming.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.761
Turn off the radio.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.568
Whassup, bee boy?

37:27.645 --> 37:29.374
Hey, Blood.

37:29.447 --> 37:32.644
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

37:32.717 --> 37:33.911
Wow!

37:33.985 --> 37:37.648
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

37:37.722 --> 37:39.155
I mean, that honey's ours.

37:39.223 --> 37:41.487
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.151
It's a close community.

37:43.227 --> 37:47.220
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

37:47.298 --> 37:50.825
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

37:50.901 --> 37:54.337
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

37:54.405 --> 37:57.374
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

37:57.441 --> 38:01.707
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.906
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

38:05.049 --> 38:07.574
You got to be kidding me!

38:07.652 --> 38:11.053
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

38:11.289 --> 38:12.950
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

38:13.190 --> 38:17.627
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

38:33.811 --> 38:37.907
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.506
What is this place?

38:39.583 --> 38:41.983
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.543
They are pinheads!

38:44.822 --> 38:46.153
Pinhead.

38:46.824 --> 38:50.351
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

38:50.428 --> 38:52.020
The Thomas 3000!

38:52.096 --> 38:53.120
Smoker?

38:53.197 --> 38:58.100
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.170
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.176
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.770
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

39:31.302 --> 39:32.792
Oh, my!

39:35.539 --> 39:37.700
What's going on? Are you OK?

39:37.775 --> 39:40.005
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

39:40.077 --> 39:43.979
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

39:44.048 --> 39:46.414
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

39:46.484 --> 39:50.181
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

39:50.254 --> 39:52.222
That's a drag queen!

39:56.727 --> 39:58.558
What is this?

40:07.304 --> 40:08.532
Oh, no!

40:08.606 --> 40:10.233
There's hundreds of them!

40:20.751 --> 40:22.412
Bee honey.

40:22.486 --> 40:26.855
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

40:26.924 --> 40:31.122
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

40:31.195 --> 40:32.287
Oh, Barry, stop.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.457
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.524
Do these look like rumors?

40:37.601 --> 40:41.264
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

40:41.338 --> 40:43.533
How did you get mixed up in this?

40:43.607 --> 40:45.131
He's been talking to humans.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.938
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

40:47.011 --> 40:49.878
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

40:49.947 --> 40:51.471
Make out? Barry!

40:51.549 --> 40:52.709
We do not.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.978
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

40:55.052 --> 40:56.280
The bees!

40:56.353 --> 41:01.154
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.955
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

41:04.028 --> 41:07.759
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

41:07.832 --> 41:10.323
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

41:10.401 --> 41:13.461
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

41:13.537 --> 41:15.061
I remember that.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.573
What right do they have to our honey?

41:17.641 --> 41:21.634
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

41:21.712 --> 41:24.408
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

41:24.482 --> 41:26.245
Sting them where it really hurts.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.579
In the face! The eye!

41:27.651 --> 41:28.879
- That would hurt.
- No.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.682
Up the nose? That's a killer.

41:30.754 --> 41:35.384
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

41:35.493 --> 41:40.328
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.329
No more bee beards!

41:49.173 --> 41:51.334
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.336
Weather with Storm Stinger.

41:53.611 --> 41:54.942
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.170
And Jeanette Ohung.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.478
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.953
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

42:05.022 --> 42:08.617
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

42:08.692 --> 42:11.422
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

42:14.331 --> 42:17.027
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

42:17.101 --> 42:21.765
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

42:21.839 --> 42:25.297
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.537
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

42:27.611 --> 42:31.047
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

42:31.115 --> 42:33.709
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

42:33.784 --> 42:37.049
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

42:37.121 --> 42:39.646
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

42:39.723 --> 42:42.817
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.258
How old are you?

42:44.328 --> 42:47.661
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

42:47.731 --> 42:50.564
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

42:50.634 --> 42:53.660
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.069
It's a common name. Next week...

42:56.407 --> 43:01.071
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

43:01.145 --> 43:02.669
Next week...

43:02.746 --> 43:07.080
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

43:07.151 --> 43:11.178
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

43:11.255 --> 43:16.352
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

43:17.928 --> 43:22.456
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

43:22.533 --> 43:26.367
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

43:26.437 --> 43:30.100
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

43:30.174 --> 43:32.870
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

43:32.943 --> 43:36.208
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

43:36.280 --> 43:38.942
I'm helping him sue the human race.

43:39.917 --> 43:42.215
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.548
This is Ken.

43:43.621 --> 43:48.718
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.124
Why does he talk again?

43:51.195 --> 43:54.130
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

43:54.198 --> 43:56.393
But it's our yogurt night!

43:56.467 --> 43:57.798
Bye-bye.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.404
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

44:02.473 --> 44:06.341
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

44:06.410 --> 44:08.640
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

44:09.813 --> 44:12.179
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

44:12.249 --> 44:14.479
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

44:15.586 --> 44:17.952
So why are you helping me?

44:18.022 --> 44:19.887
Bees have good qualities.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.753
And it takes my mind off the shop.

44:23.827 --> 44:27.957
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

44:28.032 --> 44:30.432
Those are great, if you're three.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.059
And artificial flowers.

44:32.136 --> 44:36.095
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.573
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

44:38.642 --> 44:40.769
Bees must hate those fake things!

44:40.844 --> 44:43.404
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.643
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

44:46.717 --> 44:49.584
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

44:49.653 --> 44:51.951
You sure you want to go through with it?

44:52.022 --> 44:54.923
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

44:54.992 --> 44:57.688
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

45:00.698 --> 45:03.861
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

45:03.934 --> 45:08.166
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

45:08.238 --> 45:13.198
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.906
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

45:19.983 --> 45:21.814
It's pretty big, isn't it?

45:21.885 --> 45:24.979
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

45:25.055 --> 45:29.287
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

45:30.060 --> 45:33.052
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

45:44.775 --> 45:47.903
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

45:54.084 --> 45:57.247
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.346
You boys work on this?

46:02.359 --> 46:06.022
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

46:06.096 --> 46:08.724
All right. Oase number 4475,

46:08.799 --> 46:13.202
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. The Honey Industry

46:13.270 --> 46:14.999
is now in session.

46:15.072 --> 46:19.668
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

46:19.743 --> 46:21.540
A privilege.

46:21.612 --> 46:26.948
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

46:37.795 --> 46:40.764
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

46:42.499 --> 46:46.435
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

46:48.972 --> 46:51.566
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

46:51.642 --> 46:54.736
my grandmother was a simple woman.

46:54.812 --> 46:58.509
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

46:58.582 --> 47:03.645
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

47:03.720 --> 47:07.816
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

47:07.891 --> 47:09.654
just think of what would it mean.

47:09.726 --> 47:12.923
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

47:12.996 --> 47:16.261
for the elastic in my britches!

47:16.333 --> 47:18.426
Talking bee!

47:18.502 --> 47:20.993
How do we know this isn't some sort of

47:21.071 --> 47:24.598
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

47:24.675 --> 47:27.439
They could be using laser beams!

47:27.511 --> 47:32.005
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

47:32.082 --> 47:34.676
he could be on steroids!

47:36.486 --> 47:38.181
Mr. Benson?

47:44.194 --> 47:46.890
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

47:46.964 --> 47:50.695
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

47:50.767 --> 47:53.565
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

47:53.637 --> 47:56.800
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.604
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

47:59.676 --> 48:01.473
who think they can take it from us

48:01.545 --> 48:05.675
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

48:05.749 --> 48:10.311
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

48:10.387 --> 48:12.218
but everything we are!

48:15.759 --> 48:18.956
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

48:19.029 --> 48:20.758
Oall your first witness.

48:20.831 --> 48:25.598
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

48:25.669 --> 48:27.000
I suppose so.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.836
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

48:30.908 --> 48:33.741
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

48:33.810 --> 48:37.337
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

48:37.414 --> 48:41.350
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

48:41.418 --> 48:43.352
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

48:43.420 --> 48:44.751
- No.
- No.

48:44.821 --> 48:48.484
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

48:48.558 --> 48:53.427
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

48:53.497 --> 48:56.022
They're very lovable creatures.

48:56.099 --> 48:59.626
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

48:59.703 --> 49:01.034
You mean like this?

49:04.775 --> 49:06.606
Bears kill bees!

49:07.277 --> 49:10.371
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

49:10.447 --> 49:13.507
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

49:14.618 --> 49:17.280
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

49:22.826 --> 49:26.592
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

49:26.663 --> 49:30.656
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

49:30.734 --> 49:33.396
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

49:33.470 --> 49:34.732
No, I haven't.

49:34.805 --> 49:38.332
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

49:38.408 --> 49:40.740
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

49:40.811 --> 49:43.575
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

49:43.647 --> 49:44.909
Oh, please.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.143
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

49:47.217 --> 49:50.084
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

49:50.153 --> 49:54.647
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

49:56.126 --> 49:58.890
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

49:59.696 --> 50:03.029
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

50:03.100 --> 50:06.399
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

50:06.470 --> 50:08.335
Thank you. Thank you.

50:09.006 --> 50:12.635
I see from your résumé
that you're devilishly handsome

50:12.709 --> 50:15.906
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.447
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

50:18.515 --> 50:21.780
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

50:21.852 --> 50:24.286
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

50:24.354 --> 50:28.120
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

50:28.191 --> 50:30.716
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

50:30.794 --> 50:33.922
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

50:34.865 --> 50:38.631
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

50:38.702 --> 50:41.398
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

50:41.471 --> 50:42.597
Order! Order, I say!

50:43.040 --> 50:45.270
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

50:51.048 --> 50:54.279
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

50:54.351 --> 50:56.876
I think the jury's on our side.

50:57.387 --> 50:59.947
Are we doing everything right, legally?

51:00.023 --> 51:01.183
I'm a florist.

51:01.258 --> 51:04.819
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.226
To a great team!

51:08.065 --> 51:09.862
Well, hello.

51:09.933 --> 51:11.901
- Ken!
- Hello.

51:11.968 --> 51:14.027
I didn't think you were coming.

51:14.104 --> 51:19.167
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

51:19.242 --> 51:23.508
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.579
Oh, that was lucky.

51:28.919 --> 51:31.717
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

51:31.788 --> 51:34.086
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.791
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

51:40.864 --> 51:44.425
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

51:46.269 --> 51:50.262
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

51:51.942 --> 51:55.207
Ken, Barry was looking at your résumé,

51:55.278 --> 52:00.545
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

52:00.617 --> 52:03.552
You think I don't see what you're doing?

52:03.620 --> 52:07.283
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.524
Do we?

52:09.593 --> 52:13.996
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

52:14.064 --> 52:16.897
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

52:16.967 --> 52:21.961
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

52:26.243 --> 52:28.336
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

52:28.411 --> 52:30.140
Yeah, you do that.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.144
Look at that.

52:43.994 --> 52:47.259
You know, I've just about had it

52:47.330 --> 52:50.265
with your little mind games.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.858
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

52:52.936 --> 52:54.597
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.138
A lot of ads.

52:56.206 --> 52:59.471
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

52:59.543 --> 53:03.070
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

53:04.014 --> 53:06.881
I think something stinks in here!

53:06.950 --> 53:08.440
I love the smell of flowers.

53:08.518 --> 53:11.453
How do you like the smell of flames?!

53:11.521 --> 53:12.579
Not as much.

53:28.438 --> 53:30.463
Water bug! Not taking sides!

53:32.409 --> 53:36.004
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

53:36.079 --> 53:37.774
I've got issues!

53:42.219 --> 53:45.245
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

53:45.322 --> 53:47.313
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

53:57.901 --> 53:59.368
Surf's up, dude!

53:59.436 --> 54:00.425
Poo water!

54:04.341 --> 54:06.002
That bowl is gnarly.

54:06.076 --> 54:09.512
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

54:09.579 --> 54:12.013
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

54:12.082 --> 54:15.518
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

54:15.585 --> 54:17.450
We need to talk!

54:17.520 --> 54:19.454
He's just a little bee!

54:19.522 --> 54:24.516
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

54:24.594 --> 54:29.861
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

54:29.933 --> 54:34.870
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

54:34.938 --> 54:37.873
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

54:37.941 --> 54:42.207
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

54:42.279 --> 54:44.179
Goodbye, Ken.

54:47.784 --> 54:49.775
And for your information,

54:49.853 --> 54:55.120
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

54:55.792 --> 54:58.226
I'm sorry about all that.

54:58.295 --> 55:01.958
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

55:03.600 --> 55:06.933
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

55:07.003 --> 55:09.665
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

55:09.739 --> 55:11.570
Are you OK for the trial?

55:11.641 --> 55:15.372
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

55:15.445 --> 55:19.176
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

55:19.249 --> 55:23.549
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

55:24.054 --> 55:25.180
Yeah.

55:27.557 --> 55:29.582
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

55:29.659 --> 55:31.923
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

55:31.995 --> 55:36.364
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

55:36.433 --> 55:40.164
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

55:40.236 --> 55:42.704
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

55:42.772 --> 55:45.605
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

55:45.675 --> 55:50.442
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

55:50.513 --> 55:53.949
What exactly is your relationship

55:54.017 --> 55:56.008
to that woman?

55:57.354 --> 55:58.343
We're friends.

55:58.421 --> 55:59.718
- Good friends?
- Yes.

55:59.789 --> 56:02.952
How good? Do you live together?

56:03.026 --> 56:04.493
Wait a minute...

56:04.561 --> 56:06.188
Are you her little...

56:06.696 --> 56:08.027
...bedbug?

56:09.132 --> 56:12.363
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

56:12.435 --> 56:16.235
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

56:16.306 --> 56:19.241
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

56:19.309 --> 56:21.174
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

56:21.244 --> 56:23.075
Hold me back!

56:23.146 --> 56:25.671
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

56:25.749 --> 56:27.080
He's denouncing bees!

56:27.150 --> 56:29.744
Don't y'all date your cousins?

56:29.819 --> 56:32.549
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

56:35.959 --> 56:37.620
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

56:42.732 --> 56:44.996
Oh, I'm hit!

56:45.068 --> 56:47.161
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

56:47.237 --> 56:48.864
Order! Order!

56:48.938 --> 56:52.169
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

56:52.242 --> 56:56.201
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

56:56.279 --> 57:00.978
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

57:01.050 --> 57:05.612
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

57:05.688 --> 57:08.418
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

57:09.759 --> 57:13.661
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

57:13.730 --> 57:15.527
from my heaving buttocks?

57:16.199 --> 57:19.362
I will have order in this court. Order!

57:19.436 --> 57:20.926
Order, please!

57:22.939 --> 57:26.807
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

57:26.876 --> 57:29.140
took a pointed turn against the bees

57:29.212 --> 57:33.876
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

57:46.963 --> 57:48.897
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

57:48.965 --> 57:50.455
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.600
I...

57:55.305 --> 57:56.966
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

57:57.040 --> 58:00.908
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

58:00.977 --> 58:03.741
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

58:03.813 --> 58:08.750
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

58:08.818 --> 58:11.651
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

58:12.121 --> 58:14.316
What was it like to sting someone?

58:14.390 --> 58:16.756
I can't explain it. It was all...

58:16.826 --> 58:20.318
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

58:22.999 --> 58:24.660
All right.

58:24.734 --> 58:26.759
You think it was all a trap?

58:26.836 --> 58:30.067
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

58:30.139 --> 58:34.542
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

58:34.611 --> 58:36.943
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

58:37.013 --> 58:38.275
I don't know.

58:38.348 --> 58:41.784
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

58:41.851 --> 58:45.446
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

58:45.522 --> 58:46.853
Oh, my.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.953
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

58:52.028 --> 58:53.996
- Why?
- The smoke.

58:54.063 --> 58:55.690
Bees don't smoke.

58:56.199 --> 58:58.690
Right. Bees don't smoke.

58:59.869 --> 59:03.635
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

59:03.706 --> 59:06.038
That's it! That's our case!

59:06.109 --> 59:07.940
It is? It's not over?

59:08.011 --> 59:09.979
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

59:10.046 --> 59:13.038
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

59:15.718 --> 59:20.553
And assuming you've done step 29
correctly, you're ready for the tub.

59:26.429 --> 59:27.453
Mr. Flayman.

59:27.530 --> 59:29.395
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

59:29.465 --> 59:32.161
Where is the rest of your team?

59:32.235 --> 59:34.601
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

59:34.671 --> 59:37.333
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

59:37.407 --> 59:40.137
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

59:40.810 --> 59:43.005
I actually heard a funny story about...

59:43.079 --> 59:45.513
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

59:45.582 --> 59:48.312
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

59:48.384 --> 59:53.287
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

59:53.356 --> 59:57.816
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

59:57.894 --> 01:00:01.830
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:05.830
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.199
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.671
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.004
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.738
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:18.940
Show me the smoking gun!

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.380
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.114
Here is your smoking gun.

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:29.414
What is that?

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:30.982
It's a bee smoker!

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.052
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.622
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.865
Look at what has happened

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:50.140
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:52.306
Is this what nature intended for us?

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:55.249
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.752
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.814
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:08.460
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:13.094
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.694
Free the bees! Free the bees!

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:17.933
Free the bees!

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.942
Free the bees! Free the bees!

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.946
The court finds in favor of the bees!

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.481
Vanessa, we won!

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:29.575
I knew you could do it! High-five!

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:31.379
Sorry.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:34.787
I'm OK! You know what this means?

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.348
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.861
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:47.128
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.864
You'll regret this.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.132
Barry, how much honey is out there?

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.937
All right. One at a time.

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.807
Barry, who are you wearing?

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:58.608
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:01.514
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:05.714
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:11.818
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:15.625
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.592
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.297
every last drop.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:26.671
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.678
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.408
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.849
Wait for my signal.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.981
Take him out.

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:42.958
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:46.461
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.463
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:51.864
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:56.098
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

01:02:57.673 --> 01:02:58.935
Oan't breathe.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:02.672
Bring it in, boys!

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.113
Hold it right there! Good.

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:10.284
Tap it.

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:18.623
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:22.562
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.101
Shut down honey production!

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.034
Stop making honey!

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.032
Turn your key, sir!

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:46.986
What do we do now?

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.821
Oannonball!

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.702
We're shutting honey production!

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:03.932
Mission abort.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:07.498
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:58.025
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.083
Oh, yeah?

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.891
What's going on? Where is everybody?

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:05.156
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:08.169
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:11.764
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.331
At least we got our honey back.

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:17.607
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.548
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:27.848
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.255
And now...

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.753
Now I can't.

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:44.873
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.375
I thought their lives would be better!

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:51.311
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:54.440
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:57.179
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:00.485
What happened here?

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:03.286
That is not the half of it.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.956
Oh, no. Oh, my.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.833
They're all wilting.

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.996
Doesn't look very good, does it?

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:17.403
No.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:20.806
And whose fault do you think that is?

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.473
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.741
Bees?

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.749
Specifically, me.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:32.015
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:37.082
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.026
That's our whole SAT test right there.

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:43.657
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.166
And then, of course...

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:46.997
The human species?

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:52.264
So if there's no more pollination,

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.139
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:58.578
I know this is also partly my fault.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.846
How about a suicide pact?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.444
How do we do it?

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:09.514
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:10.923
Right, right.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:15.861
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:25.699
I had to open my mouth and talk.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.041
Vanessa?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.975
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:38.077
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:42.090
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:45.594
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:50.121
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.497
I know. Me neither.

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:58.400
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:02.574
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.569
Roses!

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.078
Vanessa!

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.411
Roses?!

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:10.884
Barry?

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:14.013
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.116
Flowers, bees, pollen!

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:20.526
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:24.657
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:26.325
Oould you slow down?

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.563
Barry!

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:34.131
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.541
Yes, it kind of is.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:37.908
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:40.312
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.816
Actually, it's completely closed down.

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.819
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:49.153
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.022
I don't want to hear it!

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:55.953
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:59.228
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.895
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.098
- Bees.
- Park.

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:05.332
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:08.376
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.974
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:15.038
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:16.413
Security will be tight.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:18.247
I have an idea.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.787
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:22.517
Official floral business. It's real.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.991
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.720
Thank you. It was a gift.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:30.496
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.661
How about The Princess and the Pea?

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:36.671
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:38.001
Yes, I got it.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.106
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.042
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.774
It goes under the mattresses.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:48.612
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:51.676
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.753
Let's see what this baby'll do.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.454
Hey, what are you doing?!

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:03.358
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:06.026
...without arousing suspicion.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.639
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:12.696
Stop! Security.

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.970
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.569
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.944
Would you remove your shoes?

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:22.313
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:25.581
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:35.561
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:40.533
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.195
I think this is gonna work.

01:10:42.271 --> 01:10:43.363
It's got to work.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:46.067
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:48.439
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:51.206
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.273
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.444
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.781
Be careful.

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:03.948
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:07.518
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.958
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:16.061
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.503
Bee!

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.700
Don't freak out! My entire species...

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.311
What are you doing?

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:34.079
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.953
Don't move.

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:41.585
Oh, Barry.

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:45.463
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:49.937
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.666
And please hurry!

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:55.810
What happened here?

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:59.177
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:02.342
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.914
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.614
No one's flying the plane!

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:10.887
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:14.292
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.557
Where's the pilot?

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:18.122
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.431
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.130
As a matter of fact, there is.

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.139
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.505
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:30.136
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:32.237
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.611
I can't fly a plane.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:36.014
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.780
How hard could it be?

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:41.817
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:48.920
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:51.830
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.596
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:55.830
That's Barry!

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:59.396
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.705
and an incapacitated flight crew.

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:02.835
Flowers?!

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:07.007
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:09.812
with absolutely no flight experience.

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.319
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:16.848
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:18.893
They've done enough damage.

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.485
But isn't he your only hope?

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.360
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.366
Their wings are too small...

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.800
Haven't we heard this a million times?

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:31.237
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense. "

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.638
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.506
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.380
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:42.508
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.711
But let me tell you about a small job.

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:47.654
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:50.658
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:54.218
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:57.823
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.731
We get behind a fellow.

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:02.134
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.598
Left, right, down, hover.

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:09.234
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.871
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.746
Barry, what happened?!

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:19.754
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:22.882
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:25.552
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:33.597
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:35.364
Move out!

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:47.238
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.340
Don't have to yell.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.942
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:54.614
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.523
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:09.529
I can't do this!

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:13.132
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.568
You snap out of it.

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:20.540
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.967
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:45.632
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.834
How is the plane flying?

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.070
I don't know.

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:50.936
Hello?

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:54.005
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:55.515
The Pollen Jocks!

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.211
They do get behind a fellow.

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:59.720
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:02.780
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.349
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.725
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.026
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:12.191
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:15.566
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:18.470
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.168
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:23.575
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:24.942
Bring the nose down.

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:31.375
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:35.549
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:39.492
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.893
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:46.094
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.192
Affirmative!

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.663
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.402
Land on that flower!

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:56.068
Ready? Full reverse!

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.304
Spin it around!

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:02.540
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.984
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:09.683
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:12.591
made of millions of bees!

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:15.653
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:17.992
Rotate around it.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:22.025
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:26.131
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:29.609
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.737
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.315
Aim for the center!

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:37.352
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:49.290
Oome on, already.

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:57.629
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:00.174
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:03.143
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:07.705
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:10.308
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:20.520
Listen, everyone!

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.496
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:26.329
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:29.495
That means this is our last chance.

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:34.167
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:38.804
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.113
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.744
We're bees!

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:46.981
Keychain!

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:50.855
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.860
Hold on, Barry. Here.

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.418
You've earned this.

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:02.998
Yeah!

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:10.768
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:15.878
Oh, yeah.

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.181
That's our Barry.

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:29.520
Mom! The bees are back!

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:45.172
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.708
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:07.151
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:11.996
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:16.401
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:20.370
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.704
I had no idea.

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:24.244
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:27.509
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:28.776
Sorry I'm late.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:29.976
He's a lawyer too?

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:34.886
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.787
Have a great afternoon!

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:41.056
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:43.495
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:46.363
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:49.562
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.435
Thank you, Barry!

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:56.475
That bee is living my life!

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:57.670
Let it go, Kenny.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:00.340
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.888
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:12.723
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:44.742
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

01:29:44.812 --> 01:29:46.609
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:24.046
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:27.713
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:31.225
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:34.386
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:36.589
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

01:30:37.305 --> 01:30:43.904
