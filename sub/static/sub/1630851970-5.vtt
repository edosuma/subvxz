WEBVTT

00:32.156 --> 00:34.993
-Come on, baby!
-Yes! What a shot! Nice one, Marty.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.037
The bank's open on Sunday.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.498
-The bank's open on Sunday.
-Hold it. Guys, guys, one moment.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.711
Come on, man!

00:45.212 --> 00:47.422
Hello? Yes.

00:52.636 --> 00:53.637
Okay.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.014
Come on. Hurry it up!

00:56.098 --> 00:57.808
Okay, thank you. Bye.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.324
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, my father's dead.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.827
-All right, ball in. Ball in. Let's go.
-Your father's dead?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.370
Yeah. Ball in, ball in.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.330
-What do you mean? Like dead, dead?
-Here we go.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.269
I knew as a toddler
that my father had lost his parents

01:42.352 --> 01:43.979
because I had no grandparents.

01:45.230 --> 01:51.486
I knew as a child he had lost his siblings
because I had no uncles or aunts.

01:52.487 --> 01:56.116
I only discovered as an adolescent
he had lost his wife.

01:57.910 --> 02:02.831
I only discovered as an adult
he had lost his child.

02:03.957 --> 02:09.588
So when he got out of the camp,
he came here, having lost everything.

02:10.214 --> 02:14.343
We cannot truly mourn my father
without mourning his first wife.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.221
Without mourning my brother, Boruch.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.684
This was a great man.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.524
A he--

02:31.527 --> 02:33.529
A hero, if you will.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.617
I am nothing but grateful and humbled

02:38.700 --> 02:42.579
to be called Wolfgang Herschkopf's son.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.584
Dr. Herschkopf,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.587
Your eulogy was amazing.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.923
Thank you. Thank you.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.675
-And thank you for coming.
-Yeah.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.385
-I'll see you Thursday?
-Of course.

02:56.468 --> 03:00.472
So I was thinking,
with the holiday coming up, well…

03:00.556 --> 03:04.393
I was just wondering if you guys
would wanna come to the Hamptons house

03:04.476 --> 03:05.978
for Memorial Day weekend.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.523
Wow, that's very kind of you, Marty. I--

03:10.482 --> 03:13.235
Well, you know, we're a whole gang now.
I-- I don't want to intrude.

03:13.318 --> 03:17.531
I would love to have the kids.
I mean, there's a pool. They could swim.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.618
Well, even so,
I'm not very good company right now.

03:21.702 --> 03:26.832
Sometimes when Shiva is over
and things go back to normal,

03:26.915 --> 03:30.085
it can be, you know,
a more difficult time.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.170
I just thought…

03:32.087 --> 03:37.718
You might really enjoy being somewhere
where you can relax and be taken care of.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.636
Maybe play some hoops.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.389
That's very thoughtful of you, Marty.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.267
Well, what do you think, chuch?

03:45.350 --> 03:48.687
I mean, the Hamptons, a pool.
I mean, the girls would love it.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.273
We'll cook. We'll hang out.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.860
I-I mean, I think it could be
really great for you, Dr. Ike.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.362
It does sound nice. A weekend.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.990
Well, you heard the lady. We accept.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.575
That's great.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.785
-Thank you, Marty.
-Absolutely.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.996
-Thank you, Marty.
-Not at all.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.874
I-It's the least I could do
after everything you've done for me.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.014
Wow.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.440
Hi, Marty.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.734
Hi, guys. Hi, girls.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.195
Leave the bags. Come on.
I'll show you around.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.199
-Ugh, I love this millwork.
-Oh, yeah.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.117
-Thank you.
-And all the nauticalia.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.537
-That's not a word.
-Come out here.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.539
I need you to see this. All right?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.165
Wow.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.875
Welcome. Make yourself at home.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.585
You have a beautiful property.

04:53.669 --> 04:56.755
Yeah, our Marty is a regular Jay Gatsby.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.049
And what kind of tree is that?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.677
Well, that's a cherry tree.
Yeah, it's been here forever.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.345
And how long have you been here, Marty?

05:03.428 --> 05:05.556
It's been in my family since the '50s.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.016
You're very lucky
to have inherited this place, Marty.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.353
Not everyone gets a house
in the Hamptons handed down to them.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.107
All my dad left me was
partial hearing in my right ear

05:15.190 --> 05:17.609
and a lot of polyester pants.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.113
So, how are you feeling?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.741
Not a question I often get
in my line of business.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.826
I bet you don't.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.120
I'm good.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.830
Thank you, friend.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.208
You wanna take a nap or go for a walk?

05:33.292 --> 05:34.751
Maybe some food?

05:34.835 --> 05:38.630
Think of me as your concierge.
I'm here to help with your every need.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.215
That's very kind of you, Marty.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.969
Very kind and unnecessary.
We-- We're just thrilled to be here.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.473
And… here we are.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.435
Drumroll, please. The kitchen.

05:52.644 --> 05:56.398
Wow. Wow. Wow,
did we step into a time machine, huh?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.108
What is it, 1952 again?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.193
Ike.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.361
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
It's part of our bit.

06:01.445 --> 06:05.490
It could use some updates, sure.
I guess I've just been busy.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.242
I understand that. It can be a lot.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.495
Is that your mom?

06:10.579 --> 06:13.081
-She was so pretty.
-Yeah.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.209
-And your dad.
-Uh-huh.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.169
He's so like you.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.629
You must miss them.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.465
-Mom, can I have a bagel?
-Goddamn it.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.759
They were a great-looking couple, Marty.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.517
But listen to me.
And I know this is tough to hear.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.354
You're not honoring them
by living in the past.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.023
I just buried my dad.
I know what I'm talking about.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.107
I know you do.

06:39.191 --> 06:44.571
They died ten years ago, Marty,
but this place is a-- is a museum.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.408
Your parents would want you to be happy.
To enjoy your life.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.493
-Right?
-Sure.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.078
You've got to move on.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.666
If not for you, do it for them.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.842
Come on. Let's have a bite.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.387
All right. So here we have
the master bedroom.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.097
How charming.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.015
Wow! Look at this view.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.976
Wow, I love the Americana.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.144
-Where should we put our stuff?
-Well, it depends.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.606
There are two bedrooms in this house
and there's one bedroom in the guesthouse.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.358
Guesthouse? Fancy.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.611
You know what?
Why don't you guys stay here?

07:24.695 --> 07:28.282
What? No, that's crazy. We're not
kicking you out of the master bedroom.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.117
-I insist.
-Absolutely not.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.204
Marty, that's absurd. I'm sure
we can all squeeze into the guest bedroom.

07:34.288 --> 07:39.209
It makes sense. You guys are in here.
The girls are across the hall. It's fine.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.211
I'll sleep in the guesthouse
for the weekend.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.296
Really?

07:43.130 --> 07:47.259
Actually, it's not a bad idea.
The girls are up at the crack of dawn.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.468
That is true.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.762
All right. Then it's settled.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.423
Oh, no!

09:09.258 --> 09:13.595
I'm being attacked by sea monsters!
Help me!

09:13.679 --> 09:16.682
Well, I made you some iced coffee
if you manage to escape.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.725
-Their tentacles are so long!
-I'm gonna get you.

09:25.399 --> 09:26.608
You doing okay?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.485
Yeah, I'm okay.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.407
I feel at home here, you know, chuch?

09:34.324 --> 09:35.617
Feels right.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.452
It's so generous of Marty.

09:39.872 --> 09:41.290
Well, he invited us.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.877
-Yes! Great belly flop.
-He wants us here.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.546
You gotta learn to accept hospitality
with good grace.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.591
I mean, that's the key element
of being a good guest.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.634
No, it's just nice of him. That's all.

09:52.718 --> 09:56.471
Well, we're helping him out.
You know, he--

09:57.556 --> 10:00.934
You think he has fun
hanging around this old house by himself?

10:01.018 --> 10:03.228
I just don't want to take advantage,
you know?

10:03.312 --> 10:04.438
No, he's lonely, Bon.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.149
And what's the best treatment
for loneliness?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.692
I can throw you all day long.

10:08.775 --> 10:13.197
Company. Company is the best treatment.
I mean, look at him.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.075
-My turn, my turn!
-And throw!

10:17.784 --> 10:19.203
He's having a ball.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.914
He's laughing
for the first time in months.

10:22.748 --> 10:26.460
I'm not worried about Marty.
I'm worried about you.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.962
I'm fine.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.214
All right, you guys.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.887
-No, you can't. No, you can't. Get in!
-No, you can't.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.019
What's that?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.814
-I guess music?
-Are they having a party?

10:47.898 --> 10:50.442
No, it's a share-house.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.612
My neighbor rents it out over the summer
to cover the mortgage.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.908
Honey, come back.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.119
Honey, let it go.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.591
Wall Street idiots.
Think they own the place.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.845
I think they're just having fun.
You know, just like we are.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.556
And I actually kinda like that music.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.558
Just ignore them. That's what I do.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.687
No, you know what? Come on, Marty.
Let's go into town.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.022
-We'll get some provisions.
-What kind of provisions?

11:29.106 --> 11:32.943
You know. Some wine. Some meat.
A missile launcher. Kidding.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.111
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.863
Don't you wanna just, you know, relax?

11:35.946 --> 11:38.782
No! No, I wanna show
these guys next door how it's done.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.577
-Let's go.
-All right. All right.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.705
-There, girls.
-Guys, don't be gone too long.

11:49.835 --> 11:50.836
Hi, Ken.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.880
Hey, Marty.

11:53.380 --> 11:58.135
Hi, Elise. I wanna introduce you
to my friend. This is Ike.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.303
Dr. Ike Herschkopf.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.680
Dr. Ike. Pleasure.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.348
We're just off to the beach club.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.767
Ken went crazy and bought a catamaran.

12:05.851 --> 12:10.272
I hope I can figure out how to sail it.
Next stop, France.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.399
-Have a lovely day.
-Bye-bye.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.611
Yeah, that's Ken.
He's the money guy for a lot of people.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.114
-Roy Scheider, I think. Yeah.
-He works with Roy Scheider?

12:19.198 --> 12:21.700
Uh-huh. He was with him
the last time I saw him.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.661
Yeah, Ken has tickets to the US Open.
Some box or other.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.455
It's not really my scene though.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.461
Roy Scheider.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.925
How long has Ken lived here?

12:38.008 --> 12:40.010
He's what we call "old money."

12:40.093 --> 12:41.094
How old?

12:41.178 --> 12:43.555
Gosh, I don't know. The Dutch?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.185
Here, you need these.
Your eyes are getting all red.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.897
Sea monsters, get ready for battle!

12:51.980 --> 12:54.525
-Honey. We're back.
-Yay!

12:55.108 --> 12:56.485
Time for a sundowner, I think.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.029
-Look at you.
-Yeah.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.781
I went to the store.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.116
-You look great.
-I feel great.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.539
Mom and Dad are kissing.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.051
Let's get the party started.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.386
Okay.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.159
So, I'm feeling like I'm making progress.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.538
Yeah. You are.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.293
You, as a person,
are making incredible progress.

13:54.877 --> 13:55.961
Now you need to do the same

13:56.044 --> 13:57.880
-for your environment.
-What do you mean?

13:57.963 --> 14:00.215
Your home is
a reflection of your personality.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.426
As you become
more comfortable with yourself,

14:02.509 --> 14:05.846
as you become more authentic,
more able to invite people in,

14:05.929 --> 14:07.598
you need to do the same with your home.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.891
My apartment?

14:08.974 --> 14:12.019
No, actually I was thinking
more the house in the Hamptons.

14:12.603 --> 14:15.063
You know? Make it a place you want to be.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.317
A place that other people want to be.
A place that's open, inviting.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.402
I don't know.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.447
With just a little bit of imagination
and a little bit of work,

14:23.530 --> 14:24.823
that place could be incredible,

14:24.907 --> 14:27.117
and much more of a reflection
of where you're at now.

14:27.201 --> 14:28.952
Yeah, I guess.

14:29.036 --> 14:34.458
The kind of place
that people can arrive at from the city

14:35.751 --> 14:37.211
and just go, "Wow."

14:39.671 --> 14:43.300
Because you deserve it, Marty.
You do. You deserve it.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.344
Say it. "I deserve it."

14:47.638 --> 14:48.639
I deserve it.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.724
-Again.
-Again?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.102
I deserve it.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.187
Again.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.524
-"I deserve it." Again.
-I deserve it.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.610
-I deserve it. Again.
-I deserve it.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.029
-I deserve it.
-I deserve it.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.822
Feels good, doesn't it?

15:10.661 --> 15:13.247
-Look at this. The house next door…
-Right?

15:13.330 --> 15:15.457
-You know, jackass central?
-Yeah.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.334
-It's for sale.
-Okay.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.336
-You should buy that property.
-What?

15:19.419 --> 15:22.381
-You have to buy that property.
-I already have a house.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.342
Well, yeah, your parents' house,
but don't you want your own house?

15:25.425 --> 15:26.885
I mean, not really.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.680
Well, isn't that what every man dreams of?
His own castle.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.223
You should sell your house,
buy that house.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.808
-I don't think I need it.
-Marty. Excuse me.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.060
-Could I have a word?
-Bruce. We-- He's in a meeting.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.855
Yeah, I have this month's accounts here,
and I'd like you to take a look at it.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.983
-Great. Leave them outside.
-Yeah. Thank you, Bruce. Thank you.

15:41.817 --> 15:42.818
We'll get to it.

15:43.527 --> 15:47.656
It's a much better house.
It's bigger. It has an amazing pool.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.491
I kind of prefer mine.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.705
Sure. Okay. Yeah, well.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.498
It's just a suggestion.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.917
I'll go to my office.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.590
But I thought
your idea to renovate was great.

16:04.673 --> 16:05.674
Really?

16:05.757 --> 16:09.845
Totally. I think it's
something we should really do.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.265
I'm ready.
I just don't know where to start.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.351
Well, I mean, I could show you.
If you want.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.644
I would love that.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.480
Would you and the girls come back
this weekend?

16:20.564 --> 16:23.859
Oh, no. No, no.
You should enjoy it on your own.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.987
But I don't enjoy it on my own. Come.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.740
Please. We could at least make a start.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.535
You sure you don't mind spending
another weekend in the guesthouse?

16:35.370 --> 16:37.581
I'm beginning to think
maybe you prefer it in there.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.416
It's fine.

16:43.712 --> 16:44.713
Wow.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.883
I'm gonna chase you.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.552
Yeah, okay.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.519
Hey, see how much fresher
it feels already?

16:58.602 --> 16:59.686
It's like a new beginning.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.188
Yeah.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.815
I think I might keep this one.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.068
Sure. Yeah, of course.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.362
Whatever you want.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.660
Hey, let's have some fun.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.280
In my testicles.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.366
Ike, Ike, that's a low blow.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.537
You are something else.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.873
-You started it.
-You're a can of beans.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.084
Hey, you know, I was thinking.

18:05.627 --> 18:08.589
What if, instead of selling this property,

18:08.672 --> 18:11.758
you bought the place next door
and combined the two properties?

18:12.384 --> 18:16.221
Look, what if you…

18:17.472 --> 18:20.684
Okay, what if you put in
a beautiful tennis court

18:20.767 --> 18:23.687
and then, just next to that,
a basketball court?

18:24.188 --> 18:25.731
Then you got a little seating area.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.983
-Uh-huh.
-Behind that, like, a bar.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.401
You've got a bigger pool.

18:29.484 --> 18:33.447
And look at this.
There's room for a miniature golf course.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.616
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.118
All you have to do,
you clear out that area.

18:38.202 --> 18:44.249
Get rid of that tree, and you've added
$250,000 to your property overnight.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.920
You know, I have a patient who's
a tree guy. You should give him a call.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.964
I'm not cutting down that tree. Ever.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.508
What? What do you mean?

18:52.591 --> 18:55.511
My parents planted that tree
when they bought the house.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.556
Phyllis and I used to climb on it
when we were younger.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.475
Then her kids used to climb on it.

19:01.558 --> 19:05.020
My mom actually used to talk to the tree.

19:06.146 --> 19:10.025
She used to get up every morning
and say, "Good morning, tree."

19:11.443 --> 19:12.653
She loved that tree.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.990
Sounds weird. I love that tree.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.121
Your mother talked to a tree.
Did it answer?

19:23.205 --> 19:25.165
I don't know. Maybe.

19:28.502 --> 19:29.503
Hey.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.587
Hey, what is it?

19:31.630 --> 19:32.881
Come on. Let's keep painting.

19:38.762 --> 19:44.184
You know, anytime you wanna talk
about your dad, or anything.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.395
That's very sweet.

19:47.229 --> 19:52.317
But, to quote you, "I'm fine."

19:53.569 --> 19:57.114
I just mean, you know, you've always said,
"It's okay to not be okay."

19:57.197 --> 19:58.907
You must miss him.

19:58.991 --> 20:05.622
Listen, Marty. Between you and me,
he wasn't much of a father.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.334
He was a great man, not a great dad.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.087
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't be.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.091
I've made peace with it,

20:16.675 --> 20:19.595
'cause I know that he loved me
with every cell of his body.

20:19.678 --> 20:20.679
Of course he did.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.265
He just couldn't show me his love.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.268
I can forgive him and let it go.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.025
God, I love it here, Marty.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.485
I wish you didn't have to leave
tomorrow night.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.070
Me too.

20:37.779 --> 20:42.242
You know, something about nature
has me reevaluating my life.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.287
I've taken a dance with my creative self.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.916
I've been working on a novel.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.293
-That's great.
-It is great.

20:51.376 --> 20:57.299
And I feel like I need to maybe
take a time out and focus on that.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.677
I need a break.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.347
I need some space.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.310
Space? From what?

21:08.393 --> 21:10.020
Space from everything, you know?

21:13.065 --> 21:18.612
I feel like going somewhere
and just sitting and writing awhile.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.948
Really? Where?

21:21.031 --> 21:26.203
I don't know.
Maybe Jerusalem. I love it there.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.289
I feel like it's calling me.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.293
And I would get to do an aliyah,
which is something I've wanted to do.

21:33.377 --> 21:36.213
What do you me--
I'm sorry, it just-- It's all so--

21:37.047 --> 21:41.510
Look, I love the idea
that you wanna take the time to do this,

21:41.593 --> 21:42.761
but Jerusalem?

21:42.845 --> 21:46.807
It just seems crazy to go all that way
when everything you need is right here.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.268
Here? But this is your place, Marty.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.562
Ours. It's ours. We're family, remember?

21:51.645 --> 21:54.398
No, no. I wouldn't want to feel like
I'm getting in your way.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.066
No. No, no, no. No. Absolutely not.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.236
Because if I feel like I'm in your way,
it's very blocking to me.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.946
How can you say that?
It would be an honor.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.532
I feel the need to be
in a supportive environment.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.659
It would be supportive.
It would be so supportive here.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.036
I would love to help you
plot out the book.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.665
You could clear your head,
and get your creative juices flowing.

22:11.748 --> 22:12.958
It would be a win-win.

22:15.919 --> 22:16.920
I don't know.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.593
I'd have to think about it, Marty.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.265
Please-- Please stay.

22:38.692 --> 22:39.693
Okay.

22:41.195 --> 22:43.572
We'll send Bonnie and the kids
back to the city tomorrow,

22:43.655 --> 22:44.740
and then we'll start work.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.242
Okay. Good.

22:50.704 --> 22:51.705
Thank you.

22:54.917 --> 22:57.544
Goodbye, my favorite sea monsters.

22:57.628 --> 23:00.088
-Bye, Uncle Marty.
-Bye, Uncle Marty.

23:00.172 --> 23:01.965
Marty, don't lead him astray.

23:02.049 --> 23:03.467
I make no promises.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.302
-Bye.
-Bye.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.931
So, I'll see you… couple weeks?

23:09.014 --> 23:10.766
Well, we'll have to see.

23:11.475 --> 23:13.769
My patients know
I'm on a short sabbatical, so…

23:13.852 --> 23:15.812
-Okay.
-But I'm sure we'll have you back

23:15.896 --> 23:17.814
as soon as the first draft is done.
Right, Marty?

23:17.898 --> 23:18.899
Absolutely.

23:18.982 --> 23:21.443
Okay, well, have fun, you guys.

23:21.527 --> 23:23.278
We're not having fun. We're working.

23:23.362 --> 23:24.947
Okay, that's what I meant.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.035
-Bye, girls.
-Bye, Dad.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.286
Miss you already.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.373
Hey, don't work too hard, okay?

23:34.456 --> 23:36.708
'Cause I know how you get
when you're going through something.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.670
-Please don't play therapist with me.
-I'm just saying.

23:39.753 --> 23:43.173
You keep saying you're fine,
but I'm not sure that you are.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.110
Marty.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.612
What? Is everything okay?

24:05.696 --> 24:07.614
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's time to wake up.

24:07.698 --> 24:09.700
What? What time is it?

24:10.701 --> 24:11.827
Time to start work.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.541
Okay. All right.

24:17.624 --> 24:22.462
He knocked and slowly pushed open
the door to her boudoir.

24:24.882 --> 24:28.427
There she sat in front of the mirror,

24:28.510 --> 24:32.306
slowly applying lipstick to her mouth.

24:33.849 --> 24:36.727
Dusty pink. Parisian, possibly.

24:36.810 --> 24:37.978
"Parisian.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.690
-Possibly."
-"You were right," he said.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.776
"The body was there as you described.

24:45.527 --> 24:49.364
Under the bridge.
One brogue on the left foot."

24:49.448 --> 24:53.994
"One brogue on the left foot."

24:54.077 --> 24:58.040
"But you didn't kill him."
"How do you know?" she asked.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.418
I was just going to ask the same thing.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.172
He cou--

25:06.882 --> 25:10.469
No, no, no. Let it go. Let it go.

25:10.552 --> 25:13.305
-No, I better, just in case.
-Don't stop the flow.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.851
-Hello.
-Hey, Marty, it's Bruce. How you doin'?

25:17.935 --> 25:20.938
-I'm fine. Thank you, Bruce.
-For God's sake.

25:22.064 --> 25:23.357
Can we talk about AFC?

25:23.440 --> 25:25.359
-Not now, we're working.
-Not now, Bruce.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.693
You know what? We'll talk soon.

25:26.777 --> 25:27.945
-I promise.
-Yeah, bu-- Marty--

25:30.239 --> 25:32.449
-Sorry, Ike.
-Where were we?

25:34.743 --> 25:35.744
Focus.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.495
Then all of a sudden…

26:24.960 --> 26:26.795
Wait, wait. And I-- You know what?

26:31.466 --> 26:34.553
Marty! Hey, Marty! Come over.
Come over and meet my new friends.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.765
I gave him a new offer.
Do the right thing. Anyway.

26:40.392 --> 26:43.312
Marty! Come here. Come here.
You gotta meet everybody.

26:43.395 --> 26:48.483
This is Marcus, Brock,
Kingsley and Lennox.

26:48.567 --> 26:51.028
All their names are surnames.
It's hilarious.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.030
Hi, good to meet you.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.323
-Hey, Marty.
-Hey, Marty.

26:55.157 --> 26:58.076
These guys are the best.
They've been working 75-hour weeks,

26:58.160 --> 27:00.162
and now they're finally taking
a well-deserved break.

27:00.245 --> 27:02.039
-Am I right? Am I right?
-Hell yeah!

27:03.290 --> 27:04.499
How about this place, huh?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.461
It's somethin' else. Yeah.

27:07.544 --> 27:10.380
See that barbecue?
It's bigger than your house.

27:10.464 --> 27:12.049
Super big. Yeah.

27:12.549 --> 27:14.343
And how about this pool, huh?

27:14.426 --> 27:16.845
Kidney-shaped. You can't go wrong.

27:16.929 --> 27:21.016
I dare you to strip off and jump in.
Totally naked. Yeah? Come on!

27:21.099 --> 27:24.645
Do it! Do it! Do it!

27:24.728 --> 27:26.688
You know, I'm-- I'm too sweaty.

27:26.772 --> 27:28.065
-Sweaty?
-Come on, Marty.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.983
-Come on.
-You don't want my sweat in your pool.

27:30.067 --> 27:31.193
-Come jump in.
-Come on in, Marty.

27:31.276 --> 27:33.070
Look, I-I would love to, I just--

27:33.153 --> 27:36.365
I'm in the middle of a bunch of stuff,
and I better get back to it.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.784
-Marty.
-Nice to meet you.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.495
-Yeah.
-You just got here. Look. Marty!

27:42.204 --> 27:43.622
Marty, come on!

27:44.206 --> 27:46.083
Such a joy thief.

27:46.166 --> 27:49.962
Sorry, guys. Think I'd better
get back to my own personal hell.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.757
Still, it was nice to be out on day leave.

27:59.346 --> 28:03.767
By the way, if you could just turn
the music down a jot.

28:03.851 --> 28:06.854
I love it, but I think
Marty might be on his period.

28:06.937 --> 28:08.188
Poor Marty!

28:09.523 --> 28:10.524
Later.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.192
Top me off.

28:12.276 --> 28:14.611
What a bunch of fucking pricks.

28:15.112 --> 28:18.574
-Those guys?
-Entitled hedge fund scum.

28:18.657 --> 28:19.783
I can't stand 'em.

28:19.867 --> 28:23.287
The good news is the owner is
going through a really nasty divorce.

28:23.370 --> 28:24.371
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.290
He needs to sell quick.

28:26.373 --> 28:29.376
So you could probably offer,
like, less, and he'd have to take it.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.460
Poor Bob.

28:30.544 --> 28:32.129
You should call your Realtor.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.882
-I don't know.
-Are you crazy?

28:34.965 --> 28:36.842
You'd have the best house in Southampton.

28:39.011 --> 28:40.846
It's about the tree, isn't it?

29:07.789 --> 29:10.042
-Turn left.
-This is an adventure.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.211
It is. It is.

29:12.294 --> 29:14.546
-Okay, straight. Straight.
-Okay, right. Still going straight.

29:14.630 --> 29:16.882
-You're going to turn right. Now…
-And now?

29:17.716 --> 29:19.510
-I feel dizzy.
-Do you know where you are?

29:19.593 --> 29:21.220
I can't even begin to guess.

29:21.303 --> 29:24.932
-Okay, now. Stop. I'm just--
-Yep. What?

29:25.015 --> 29:26.266
-Okay.
-Yeah.

29:27.351 --> 29:29.269
Okay, open your eyes.

29:31.980 --> 29:36.818
Yeah, you will never have to look at
that blueberry hellhole again.

29:36.902 --> 29:39.112
-Never again.
-Never again.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.365
There's holes in the wall.

29:41.448 --> 29:42.574
It's on its way.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.702
-It's gonna be-- I have this vision.
-Yeah.

29:45.786 --> 29:48.497
All that monochromatic nonsense.

29:48.580 --> 29:53.085
You know what? This is where
my parents used to measure Phyllis and me.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.753
Oh, my gosh.

29:55.337 --> 29:58.173
Isn't it funny to think about?
I-I was only that tall.

29:58.257 --> 30:01.802
Oh, my gosh. That was the summer
that Phyllis really shot up,

30:01.885 --> 30:04.054
-and I-I-I was so jealous.
-They're dead.

30:05.556 --> 30:08.642
-What?
-Marty, you have to let them go.

30:08.725 --> 30:12.271
I swear, this house,
it's not a museum. It's a tomb.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.149
You know, sometimes I feel like
I'm working on you,

30:16.233 --> 30:18.861
but I don't think you're working on you.
Do you know what I'm saying?

30:18.944 --> 30:22.990
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I promise, I'll work harder.

30:24.366 --> 30:25.450
Don't be mad at me.

30:25.534 --> 30:27.703
I'm not mad. I'm just--

30:29.037 --> 30:30.455
Marty, relax.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.126
Yeah, breathe.
It's not good for your heart.

30:36.336 --> 30:40.007
It's gonna be great.
It's not done. It's gonna be great.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.175
-Trust me.
-Okay.

30:58.692 --> 31:01.945
So, I just got off the phone
with the Realtor.

31:02.029 --> 31:04.156
-Really? What did he say?
-Bad news.

31:04.239 --> 31:05.616
How do you mean?

31:05.699 --> 31:08.452
He says under no circumstances
should anyone buy that house.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.913
It needs underpinning,
and the septic tank has never worked.

31:11.413 --> 31:12.539
Why would he say that?

31:14.082 --> 31:16.126
You know what?
He wants to buy the house himself.

31:16.210 --> 31:19.880
Oh, no. No. He's an old family friend.
He's just trying to give me a heads-up.

31:19.963 --> 31:23.383
Bullshit. He knows you're sitting
on a gold mine, and he wants a piece.

31:23.467 --> 31:24.676
I don't think so.

31:25.552 --> 31:26.678
He's lying, Marty.

31:26.762 --> 31:29.389
Now, look, we need to move quickly.
Have you called the tree guy?

31:30.390 --> 31:31.475
No.

31:31.558 --> 31:32.559
Why not?

31:34.645 --> 31:36.522
What is it with you and that fucking tree?

31:37.022 --> 31:40.776
I don't know.
I guess it just has sentimental value.

31:40.859 --> 31:43.445
Sentimental val-- Did this tree raise you?

31:44.530 --> 31:45.364
No.

31:45.447 --> 31:49.368
No? Did this tree change your diaper?
Did it cook you a meal?

31:49.451 --> 31:50.702
Did it pay for your school?

31:51.286 --> 31:53.497
That's not really what I'm trying to say.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.250
What are you saying?
Are you in love with the tree?

31:57.167 --> 31:59.211
Marty, you told me years ago
you'd never been in love,

31:59.294 --> 32:01.797
but you failed to mention
that you're in love with a tree.

32:01.880 --> 32:02.881
I'm just fond of it.

32:02.965 --> 32:05.300
Fond? Fond how? Like, sexually?

32:06.260 --> 32:09.388
Because it's sounding an awful lot to me
like maybe you want to fuck this tree.

32:10.806 --> 32:12.140
I don't want to fuck the tree.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.435
I'm joking.

32:21.275 --> 32:25.571
I just feel like, if anyone has a thing
about the tree, it's you.

32:26.154 --> 32:29.074
I said I didn't want to chop it down,
and you won't let it go.

32:29.157 --> 32:32.786
For some reason,
it feels like you hate this tree.

32:36.623 --> 32:39.668
So, the lunatics have taken over
the asylum, have they?

32:40.377 --> 32:42.254
You're psychoanalyzing me?

32:42.337 --> 32:44.631
No. No, no. I just-- I don't understand--

32:44.715 --> 32:46.133
No, you don't understand, Marty.

32:47.301 --> 32:48.802
But let me see if I can help you.

32:50.012 --> 32:54.016
Your feelings about this tree
are not healthy.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.519
And it's all to do with your mother.

32:57.603 --> 33:00.230
The way your mother loved you
was not healthy,

33:00.314 --> 33:03.525
and that is a deep root of your pathology.

33:03.609 --> 33:08.947
A Freudian would say
that this tree is your mother's phallus.

33:09.031 --> 33:13.577
A big, looming totem
of her inappropriate desire for you.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.495
-That's not--
-Yes.

33:15.579 --> 33:18.874
Or it's her birth canal
trying to suck you back in.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.835
Your mother wouldn't let you grow up,

33:21.919 --> 33:26.173
and now she has left you
emotionally and sexually stunted.

33:26.256 --> 33:27.966
And it is a fucking tragedy!

33:28.050 --> 33:29.510
Please stop.

33:30.093 --> 33:32.471
I know. I know, Marty. It's hard.

33:32.554 --> 33:36.099
The truth is hard,
but it is the only way you will heal.

33:38.769 --> 33:42.606
I love you properly. I won't hurt you.

33:43.106 --> 33:47.027
I will make sure
you blossom like this tree.

33:49.696 --> 33:50.697
Okay.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.248
I know. I know.

34:03.544 --> 34:04.795
So, what are you gonna do?

34:11.301 --> 34:12.302
I don't know.

34:14.972 --> 34:18.516
Even now? I thought we just looked
into your heart and your soul.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.101
I thought we had a breakthrough there.

34:22.187 --> 34:24.231
-Am I just wasting my time?
-No. No, of course not.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.275
You know what?
Maybe I'm just a terrible therapist.

34:26.358 --> 34:27.650
No, no. You're not.

34:27.734 --> 34:29.695
No, I think I might be
a terrible therapist

34:29.777 --> 34:31.947
because obviously,
you have not moved on at all.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.826
-You know, maybe I should just give up.
-No.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.244
Great-- Yes. Great idea.

34:37.327 --> 34:39.871
I give up on you,
and I give up on therapy.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.331
No, it's all right. Don't worry.

34:42.416 --> 34:45.335
I'm going to pack my bags,
and I'm gonna get out of your life.

36:40.033 --> 36:42.452
Why is Pearl even here?
He wasn't her father.

36:42.536 --> 36:44.788
Yeah, but he raised her,
and she loved him.

36:46.081 --> 36:48.458
I didn't think I had any tears left.

36:48.542 --> 36:50.043
It's good to let it come out.

36:50.794 --> 36:52.421
What did Wolf used to say?

36:53.046 --> 36:55.716
He'd say, "Mom's leaking again."

36:56.466 --> 37:01.388
Or, "You two better drink some water.
You're about to cry yourselves thirsty."

37:07.102 --> 37:08.270
How you doing?

37:08.353 --> 37:09.688
I'm fine, Mom.

37:09.771 --> 37:11.356
I know this is hard for ya.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.108
No. It's actually easy.

37:14.526 --> 37:16.737
-Ike.
-No. I'm free of trying to please him.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.822
Trying to please a man
who couldn't show love.

37:18.906 --> 37:20.240
Honey, listen to me.

37:20.324 --> 37:21.700
So, it's a good thing.

37:21.783 --> 37:24.119
He wanted to so much.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.080
Not enough.

37:27.664 --> 37:32.669
After losing Boruch, he couldn't dare
let himself love another son.

37:32.753 --> 37:35.172
You can understand that, can't you?

37:38.008 --> 37:39.009
No.

37:59.071 --> 38:01.573
So, I have some news.

38:02.366 --> 38:04.409
The sale went through, finally.

38:07.162 --> 38:08.956
So I own both properties.

38:11.416 --> 38:12.835
Congratulations.

38:12.918 --> 38:16.588
Called a contractor to rip down the fence.

38:16.672 --> 38:17.881
Nah, let's just do it now.

38:18.549 --> 38:19.800
Let's get it done.

38:54.126 --> 38:55.294
Jesus.

39:01.592 --> 39:02.593
You all right?

39:06.889 --> 39:08.473
We should have a party.

39:09.683 --> 39:11.226
A housewarming party.
