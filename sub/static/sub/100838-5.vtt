00:07.632 --> 00:09.217
[water gurgling]

00:10.844 --> 00:13.179
[muffled music]

00:19.519 --> 00:22.147
[upbeat music playing]

00:24.566 --> 00:28.278
[Jen] This was a good idea.
You were right. I just needed a vacation.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.446
-[Judy] Right?
-Yeah.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.905
-A little holiday?
-Yeah.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.825
Palm Springs, you know,
get away from it all?

00:33.908 --> 00:34.826
Mm-hm.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.411
<i>Codependent No More.</i>

00:36.786 --> 00:38.955
Doing a little light reading by the pool?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.081
Yes, I am.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.917
I'm trying to unpack everything
with Steve, now that it's over. Again.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.296
I need to learn how to be on my own,
take care of myself.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.465
Oh, your shoulders are getting pink!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.258
-Let me get that.
-You <i>are </i>codependent.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.384
Right?

00:52.802 --> 00:55.138
-Is it weird that I like it?
-I love that you like it.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.848
You know what I also like?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.851
I like a margarita
by the pool in a plastic cup.

00:59.934 --> 01:00.769
-Oh!
-Yeah.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.521
In fact... Can I get one more?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.774
Okay, well,
codependent reminder to hydrate.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.651
Because it's 11:30 in the morning,
and you have to pace yourself.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.154
Yeah. Well, you know what,
this is me pacing myself.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.239
And I wanna be very clear.

01:13.573 --> 01:16.242
Mommy can do whatever she wants.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.953
Oh. Is Mommy calling herself Mommy?

01:19.037 --> 01:20.622
-Mommy is.
-Oh.

01:20.705 --> 01:24.584
Mommy's kids are with the grandmother,
and Mommy ain't got shit to do.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.504
Mommy does have some shit to do.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.547
-No shit.
-[Wayne] Jen? Judy?

01:30.465 --> 01:31.424
[Jen] Hi, Pastor Wayne.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.177
I'm so happy you could make it
to our Friends of Heaven Grief Retreat.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.261
Grief treat!

01:36.513 --> 01:38.681
I do hope you'll take
the opportunity this weekend

01:38.765 --> 01:41.559
to imbibe some of our
therapeutic workshops.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.646
This weekend could be
a real turning point for you.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.398
I'm so excited.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.777
I'm really looking forward
to taking a look inward.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.070
Kiss-ass!

01:52.153 --> 01:54.239
There are seminars specialized
for all walks of grief.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.075
It's very powerful
when all that trauma comes together.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.409
It should be a really good time.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.203
-[Jen] Yeah.
-[Judy] Thanks.

02:01.037 --> 02:04.040
I don't think that guy would know
a good time if it fucked him in the...

02:04.124 --> 02:05.125
[splash]

02:09.420 --> 02:12.173
[Judy] I do think it'd be good for you
to participate a little this weekend.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.758
-[Jen] Oh!
-Lean in.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.427
You know? So you're not just numbing
your pain.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.428
Pain?

02:18.429 --> 02:19.848
There's no pain with this guy.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.641
No, all joy.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.477
Ooh! I think I'm gonna go  to...

02:25.186 --> 02:28.648
"Lost Angels: Finding Yourself
After Pregnancy Loss" at noon.

02:28.731 --> 02:31.276
[gasps] Wait. You could check out
"Window to the Widow."

02:31.359 --> 02:35.822
Okay. No. I came here to escape,
not wallow in my widowhood.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.074
-Hey, ladies.
-[both] Hi.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.617
-Got something for you.
-[Judy] What?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.995
-Here you go.
-Oh, my God, Yolanda.

02:42.078 --> 02:42.912
Look at this.

02:42.996 --> 02:43.872
[Jen gasps]

02:44.122 --> 02:45.248
-Isn't it great?
-It's great.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.416
And voila.

02:46.916 --> 02:47.876
[Judy] Nice.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.378
So, any tips for the weekend?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.464
Well, I always get a lot out
of "Cooking for One with Chef Sue."

02:54.257 --> 02:55.967
That sounds like a goofy class.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.136
Hey, you coming to WTTW?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.470
I have no idea what that is.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.555
-Window to the Wid--
-No.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.849
Window to the Widow.

03:04.309 --> 03:08.354
"This workshop is focused on keeping
the window to the widow's heart open

03:08.438 --> 03:10.690
to the love she shared with the departed."

03:10.940 --> 03:13.484
-Love is eternal.
-Yeah. Not if the fucker cheated.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.570
Now, that's different.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.322
[Jen] Yeah. It's different.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.867
I swear to God, I think these people
actually get off on their grief.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.328
Well, maybe they're just embracing
where they are.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.955
Well, you know, where I am
is ready to move on.

03:27.081 --> 03:30.168
You know what?
There's some really fun gay bars downtown.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.046
We could go dancing,
get completely ignored.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.881
-[laughs]
-It could be super fun.

03:34.964 --> 03:35.798
Maybe.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.301
But there's also lot of fun stuff
to do here.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.011
Hmm.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.138
I see one fun thing I can do.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.975
[Judy] Oh, my God, I see that, too.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.437
But according to the brochure,
this is a time of healing

03:49.520 --> 03:51.064
and self-exploration.

03:51.147 --> 03:51.981
Okay.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.901
Well, according to my husband,
I was dead, and we weren't married.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.446
So that means that somebody
is open for business.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.199
And that somebody's business
is her vagina.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.283
Pussy!

04:02.367 --> 04:03.910
I thought you were gonna say "poontang."

04:03.993 --> 04:05.870
-Ew! I would not say that.
-You might say that.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.789
-Really?
-Yeah, poontang.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.208
Hmm. Hmm.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.293
[Judy] Vegas Chapter.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.711
-Hi.
-He's from Vegas.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.173
-Widow.
-Jeez!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.050
[Judy] Okay. So my baby seminar

04:19.300 --> 04:21.719
-is in the Desert Winds Ballroom.
-Mm-hm.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.972
-Then I'll meet you after?
-Yeah. Totally.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.682
-Am I okay to leave you?
-Uh-huh.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.393
Judy, I'm not the one
who can't be left alone.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.602
That's true.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.896
Yeah. Oh! Dude from the pool.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.940
-Dude from the pool. Hi!
-What is going on?

04:34.315 --> 04:35.483
Hi. Hi.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.442
Hi.

04:37.443 --> 04:38.528
-Nice shirt.
-Oh!

04:38.987 --> 04:40.697
How embarrassing,
we all wore the same thing.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.532
Yeah. Maybe I should do that to mine.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.908
Yeah, maybe you should.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.369
You're going to The Big Question?

04:47.662 --> 04:50.748
Oh, yeah, no question about it.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.376
-Should I save you a seat?
-Yeah.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.170
Okay. Cool.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.216
-What?
-Holy eye contact that just happened.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.135
Oh, my God, how did you do that?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.887
-This is gonna be really good for you.
-I know.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.014
Don't bring the drink in.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.766
Out of respect for the other grievers,
especially the cute one.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.477
-He's very hot. I'll see you later.
-Oh, my God, super hot.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.604
-I'm taking the...
-He's like a good old-fashion hunk.

05:13.688 --> 05:17.066
Have fun at your baby thing...
Oh, that's not fun, is it?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.277
Excuse me.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.406
Hi. Oh, boy. Oh, boy, boy. You know?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.075
-Go!
-I'm going.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.832
[Wayne] Welcome to The Big Question.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.669
Actually... there's 14.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.629
-[Jen] Jesus.
-[Wayne] We'll break down questions

05:38.713 --> 05:39.922
that have no easy answer.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.257
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.760
[Wayne] Is screaming
into my pillow healthy?

05:44.761 --> 05:45.636
[sighs]

05:46.471 --> 05:47.722
Why can't I stop eating?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.767
So, who died and sent you here?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.352
[Wayne] When will I run out of tears?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.269
Wow!

05:54.020 --> 05:56.189
-Do you say that to all the widowers?
-[laughs]

05:56.856 --> 05:57.857
I might.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.318
Depends on how well our conversation goes.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.527
[Wayne] How can I smile?

06:03.029 --> 06:03.863
My wife died.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.531
Sailing accident.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.283
Boats.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.118
[Wayne] Why do I feel guilty if I laugh?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.579
My husband was in a hit-and-run.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.207
-[Wayne] How do I think about...
-I'm Jen.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.166
[Wayne] ...not that?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.085
-Jason.
-Oh, hi. Jen.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.213
Jason. Are you--?

06:20.296 --> 06:21.881
You said that already. Huh?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.300
-[Wayne] Does trauma last forever?
-Are you drunk?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.552
-Could be.
-[clears throat]

06:26.636 --> 06:28.471
What? Sorry!

06:30.181 --> 06:32.392
Does trauma last forever? Maybe.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.394
I know him.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.563
-He your pastor?
-Oh, God, no. [laughs]

06:37.647 --> 06:39.232
[Wayne continues]

06:39.649 --> 06:40.525
Ew!

06:40.650 --> 06:43.111
The road was fraught. It was.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.531
Not just to get pregnant,
but to stay pregnant.

06:46.948 --> 06:51.702
And as much as we wanted a child to embody
the love that we felt for each other,

06:51.786 --> 06:54.580
the struggle to have a baby
almost tore us apart.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.835
-I wonder if any of you experienced that?
-I have. Hi, I'm Judy.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.794
Um...

07:00.169 --> 07:01.879
My relationship
didn't survive the struggle.

07:01.963 --> 07:05.341
And it's not that I really wanna
even be with him, exactly, I just...

07:05.925 --> 07:08.219
I don't wanna sit in these feelings alone.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.846
That was a rhetorical question.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.180
Oh.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.307
Oh. I'm sorry.

07:13.891 --> 07:14.725
Um...

07:15.685 --> 07:17.895
I thought everybody was sharing.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.772
-I'm just gonna keep going.
-Yeah! Thanks.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.733
After IVF, IUI, PGD...

07:22.817 --> 07:23.734
I did all of those.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.654
...our doctor told us that maybe
we were having a run of bad luck.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.741
Bad luck?
Luck felt like such an insufficient word.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.871
And just when it seemed like
our heartbreak would destroy us,

07:35.538 --> 07:39.041
we tried one last time.
And what do you know?

07:39.792 --> 07:40.877
Our luck changed.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.381
-[sentimental music playing]
-[gasps] Oh, my God!

07:45.465 --> 07:48.050
-[group coos]
-[leader] Your luck can change, too.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.553
But you need to stop with the self-talk

07:50.636 --> 07:52.972
that says there's something wrong
with you, with your body.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.682
Stop shaming yourself.

07:55.516 --> 07:56.601
Repeat after me.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.394
I am not broken.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.438
[all] I am not broken.

08:00.646 --> 08:01.564
Join hands.

08:03.983 --> 08:04.859
Say it again.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.569
Now you can talk. Okay?

08:07.361 --> 08:09.113
I am not broken.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.157
[all] I am not broken.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.118
-Say until you believe it.
-[all] I am not broken.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.995
I am not broken.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.164
-[leader] There we go.
-[all] I am not broken.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.208
-[leader] Yes.
-[all] I am not broken.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.418
I am not broken.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.420
I am not broken.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.172
I am not broken.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.299
Wow. That was a lot to take in.

08:28.382 --> 08:32.011
Yeah. Pastor Wayne has a way of saying
things without saying anything.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.347
-I don't know.
-He just goes on and on

08:34.430 --> 08:36.015
about how you can have your feelings,

08:36.098 --> 08:40.603
but I just think he wants you to stay sad,
like, wallow in it all.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.022
It's good for his business. [laughs]

08:44.106 --> 08:48.110
I actually was in his grief group,
and I didn't get anything out of it.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.529
Hey, Jen.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.240
Hi.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.077
I think you get out of it
what you put into it.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.162
But what do I know?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.708
-Oh, shit!
-Busted!

09:02.792 --> 09:04.460
I know, but I wasn't lying.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.754
-I actually did get something out of it.
-Yeah?

09:06.837 --> 09:10.174
Sometimes, it's nice to know you're not
the only one who asks dumb questions.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.300
-Right.
-You know?

09:11.676 --> 09:13.636
Well, I'm glad you got
something out of it.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.430
Do you wanna get a drink?

09:17.014 --> 09:19.934
Just... I happen to know that this place
has margaritas

09:20.017 --> 09:23.020
that are mediocre yet very effective.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.898
I can't. I'm sorry.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.942
I already signed up for Man-to-Man Yoga.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.777
Oh, that sounds gay.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.487

21:32.207 --> 21:33.542
Just need to unwind a bit.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.294
Yeah. Me too.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.046
-You know what?  Why don't I just--?
-No, it's okay.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.382
It's okay.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.510
We can... be alone together.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.431
Do you mind if I smoke?

21:48.015 --> 21:48.849
No.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.059
Mind if I drink?

21:53.478 --> 21:54.313
Look at you.

21:55.814 --> 21:56.940
You mind sharing?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.360
[Nick] You're an artist.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.488
Hmm, not really. I just paint for myself.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.825
-Did you paint that little girl?
-Yeah.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.494
Then you're an artist.

22:10.579 --> 22:11.788
You don't think they're creepy?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.498
Um... I do.

22:14.624 --> 22:15.792
But they're also beautiful.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.422
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.885
So tell me about your friend.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.346
The one that you dedicated the song to.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.931
-Lucas.
-Yeah. Lucas.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.143
Yeah. Well...

22:34.019 --> 22:34.895
we...

22:35.312 --> 22:37.314
worked together. We were partners.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.483
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.153
I don't know
what it's like to be a widower,

22:43.236 --> 22:44.905
or to lose a kid, but...

22:46.448 --> 22:48.533
I definitely know
what it's like to lose a best friend.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.371
-It sucks.
-Yeah. That would be really hard.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.415
I haven't even been back to work
since he died.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.251
How did it happen?

22:59.628 --> 23:00.462
On duty.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.298
I'm sorry...

23:04.549 --> 23:06.051
what is it that you do?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.970
[Jen] I wanna apologize
for what I said earlier.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.224
I know you think I'm a dick.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.018
-Not at all.
-A little.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.105
Maybe a little.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.607
I'm sorry. I...

23:21.775 --> 23:22.943
I know you mean well.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.446
Like, I know you don't take
the work seriously,

23:26.530 --> 23:28.031
or me seriously.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.118
-Look, don't take it personally.
-I don't.

23:31.868 --> 23:35.163
Yeah. I know you use cynicism
as a way to deal with grief.

23:35.372 --> 23:36.248
You're not the first.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.626
No. But I am the best.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.711
Oh, yeah. You've raised the bar.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.423
Ah! It's good to be appreciated.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.175
I do appreciate you.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.603
He was... he was cheating on me.

23:59.729 --> 24:00.730
My husband.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.566
Before he died.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.401
I just found out.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.528
[sighs]

24:07.195 --> 24:08.530
I'm so sorry.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.740
Yeah. Me too.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.788
How does knowing that make you feel?

24:23.837 --> 24:25.005
Like I hate him.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.594
That seems right.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.472
[tearfully] I don't want to hate him.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.392
I don't want to feel
any of this shit anymore.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.186
Jen...

24:39.519 --> 24:43.940
I know I'm supposed to forgive him
because that's the way through, and...

24:44.441 --> 24:47.194
Look, see, I... I listen.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.780
I just don't like to apply it.

24:52.741 --> 24:53.867
[exhales]

24:53.950 --> 24:55.785
Maybe you can't forgive him for dying.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.541
-He didn't mean to die.
-Fair.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.045
But you don't know
how your story was gonna end,

25:05.670 --> 25:08.298
and someone just ripped
those pages out of your book.

25:10.008 --> 25:10.842
Right.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.846
Maybe he was gonna tell you or apologize.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.556
Or leave me.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.142
He did leave you.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.647
[sighs deeply] Yeah.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.108
Believe it or not, what I'm hearing...

25:28.485 --> 25:30.612
is that you really loved him.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.328
Yeah.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.415
[sighs] Yeah.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.713
Do you have any cigarettes?

25:50.006 --> 25:50.840
No.

26:06.439 --> 26:07.482
Oh, shoot.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.276
-[horn blares]
-Oh!

26:13.238 --> 26:14.906
[sobbing]

26:18.868 --> 26:19.953
Oh, my God...

26:47.063 --> 26:47.981
[zipper rasps]

26:51.151 --> 26:52.110
Hi.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.446
Hi.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.616
Are you okay?

26:59.367 --> 27:00.493
No.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.081
How was your night?

27:05.457 --> 27:09.252
Um, it was... maybe better than yours?

27:12.380 --> 27:14.549
I need to get my shit together, Judy.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.594
-Okay.
-For my boys.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.138
Okay.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.683
But there's no escaping it. It's just...

27:25.560 --> 27:28.813
It's, like, wherever you go,
there you are. You know?

27:31.024 --> 27:31.900
Yeah.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.529
Which just... sucks.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.285
I wish you didn't feel like that.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.704
Well, I do.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.501
Because someone ripped my life apart.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.215
I hate that person.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.886
[water running]

28:01.680 --> 28:02.722
[door opens]

28:06.351 --> 28:07.185
Hi.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.062
[Nick] Hey.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.064
This is my friend, Jen.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.653
I usually look a little better than this.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.030
Hello, friend.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.573
-[sniffs]
-This is Nick.

28:21.741 --> 28:22.742
Hi, Nick.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.709
He's a cop.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.797
A detective, actually.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.222
You ever solve a hit-and-run?
