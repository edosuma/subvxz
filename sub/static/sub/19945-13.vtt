WEBVTT

01:02.437 --> 01:05.315
Ugh. Blah. Agh.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.862
- Good morning.
- Not really.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.661
Oh, I'm glad to see you're doing that.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.829
I'm not.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.583
I'm gonna scramble some eggs.
You want some?

01:22.666 --> 01:26.795
If you mean smashing my pills into them
and feeding it to me like a dog...

01:27.504 --> 01:30.132
yeah, sure.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.760
Do you want some help with that?

01:33.844 --> 01:35.637
I think you've helped enough.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.686
Frankie, I'm sorry I upset you last night.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.316
I mean, I stand by what I said, but it
certainly could have come out better.

01:47.399 --> 01:51.111
Jacob said you'd say that,
so now I owe him a scalp massage.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.614
But the joke's on him. I enjoy doing it.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.074
Oh!

01:58.869 --> 02:00.037
Help, please.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.084
God, you've got beautiful skin.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.628
Thank you.

02:07.711 --> 02:11.089
You've got to keep your arm in this
position so you can get a good reading.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.885
-Jacob says I should listen to you.
-He did?

02:14.968 --> 02:18.972
He also said that I should let you help me
with things like this that you're good at.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.308
I don't know if I'm good at it, but--

02:21.391 --> 02:24.728
Oh, 132-over-84.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.397
-That's not bad.
-Eighty-four is a good year.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.692
You know,<i> Purple Rain.</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:34.237
Okay.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.743
Wait, what is that? What's happening?

02:39.826 --> 02:43.705
What? You know I like tots with my eggs.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.791
Look, at the risk of upsetting you again,

02:45.874 --> 02:49.086
do you have any idea
how much sodium there is in all that?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.254
I'm guessing a delicious amount.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.091
I'm taking the pills, I'm using the cuff.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.635
Don't take away my food friends.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.055
I'm just suggesting a few dietary changes
could reduce your risk

03:00.138 --> 03:02.391
of having another stroke by 80 percent.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.811
Did you read those pamphlets?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.064
-Yes.
-You did?

03:09.147 --> 03:12.359
Or Jacob read them.
You decide what's true.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.280
So Jacob said
I'm good at health management, huh?

03:17.364 --> 03:19.574
-He did.
-And you agree?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.952
-Don't get cocky.
-Because if that's the case,

03:22.035 --> 03:25.372
I'm gonna send you a terrific article
from the<i> New England Journal of Medicine</i>

03:25.455 --> 03:28.542
about what to do
in the 90 days following a stroke.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.420
I want you to read it out loud
to yourself.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.881
Fine. I will read it
with a British accent.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.091
Knock yourself out.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.343
Oh, this is going to be delicious.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.595
You know, instead of using salt,
I put in cumin.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.098
To think I got my taste back for this.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.726
I got it.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.280
Can I help you?

04:00.449 --> 04:01.950
Oh, hello.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.786
Yes.

04:14.838 --> 04:15.672
Thank you.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.973
It's from Omni Tech.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.600
What is it?

04:27.225 --> 04:29.311
Cease-and-desist.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.313
Oh, my God. They're suing us!

04:31.396 --> 04:34.149
That guy, he has a set of grapes on him.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.942
Not for long.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.944
Let's get down to business.

04:38.570 --> 04:44.910
We now know that Frank Erstengeist,
active homophobe agitator,

04:44.993 --> 04:49.414
is also the owner
of Frank's Bakery on Aurora Avenue.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.875
Oh, my God. Those are my favorite bagels.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.794
The everything really has everything.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.923
I know, Peter, but it turns out
the secret ingredient is hate.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.383
That's good. That's sign good.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.846
-How about "Keep bigots out of bagels"?
-That's strong.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.558
Now, I did some stakeout work yesterday--

05:08.642 --> 05:10.185
Wow, you sure did.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.523
-You really are retired.
-Mmm.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.441
How did you get so close?

05:16.525 --> 05:19.069
Full disclosure,
I went in for the bagel brunch.

05:19.152 --> 05:23.114
Yes, before you ask,
I was heavily disguised.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.324
But it was worth it.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.160
I know how we're going to do this protest.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.704
Sol, if I may. Protests are well and good.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.874
But what do you say to the long con?

05:32.958 --> 05:33.875
Explain.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.253
Well, this Frank fellow
doesn't know me, right?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.213
So I'll go in and inquire about a job.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.049
I'm over-qualified
and an empirical charmer, so I'll get it.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.969
I'll work the counter for a few months,
earning his trust,

05:44.052 --> 05:46.137
establishing relationships
with the customers,

05:46.221 --> 05:48.557
inside jokes with the waitresses,
the whole bit.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.685
I get close to Frank... maybe too close.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.481
Maybe we even share a furtive kiss
when I'm closing down one night.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.985
You know, these raging homophobes
are often closeted gays themselves.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.403
We never talk about it.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.488
We share a secret now.

06:04.489 --> 06:09.202
Every day we see each other,
both knowing, both silent.

06:09.703 --> 06:13.206
And then, when the moment is just right...

06:14.457 --> 06:16.751
-I pee in the bagel dough.
-God damn it, Steve!

06:16.835 --> 06:18.837
Why is that always your go-to?

06:18.920 --> 06:19.921
So, it's a no?

06:20.005 --> 06:21.881
Well, when has anything
you've ever said been a "yes"?

06:21.965 --> 06:25.719
I was thinking we could get
everyone together, make some signs,

06:25.802 --> 06:30.682
and chain ourselves to the entrance
so no one can get in

06:30.765 --> 06:32.309
and so the fuzz can't move us.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.144
-Oh, I like that.
-Yeah, whatever.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.479
Oh, excuse me, honey?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.565
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.610
Of course.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.781
Ooh...

06:46.865 --> 06:49.117
Someone is in trouble.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.245
Are you kidding me? You can't sue us!

06:52.329 --> 06:53.788
It was our idea!

06:53.872 --> 06:56.416
Grace, you said you were gonna sue me,
but I never heard from you.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.168
What's a guy got to do
to get your attention?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.503
You're suing me so you can see me?

07:00.587 --> 07:03.173
I'm being proactive,
one of the things you like about me.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.051
There is nothing I like about you.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.679
-Oh, come on, it's cute. I'm a scamp.
<i>-Oh, stop.</i>

07:09.763 --> 07:11.556
This is not a game to me.

07:12.641 --> 07:17.187
We built Vybrant from nothing in our 70s.
And it was just starting to take off.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.648
And not filling orders
is not good for business.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.192
And if you think
that I'm going down without a fight,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.443
you're not as smart as you look.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.989
-You think I look smart?
-What is wrong with you?

07:33.995 --> 07:38.124
But you realize if you get caught
breaking the law, you could be disbarred.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.377
What do I care? I'm retired.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.088
-Well, I care very much.
-About that?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.215
But you don't care about this jackass?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.968
That's the point. He's a jackass!
He's not worth it!

07:48.051 --> 07:52.055
That homophobe burst into your show
and tried to ruin your opening night!

07:52.138 --> 07:55.433
Oh, now you've got to go
bursting into his bagelry to--

07:55.517 --> 07:56.518
Damn right we do!

07:57.519 --> 08:02.190
To give him a taste of his own medicine,
to show him what it feels like,

08:02.273 --> 08:04.985
to not just roll over and take it!

08:05.068 --> 08:06.945
Oh, good God! Have you lost your mind?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.197
Now you sound like John Adams.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.243
It's amazing to me that you can play
a revolutionary on stage so well,

08:13.326 --> 08:16.079
but in real life, you're just another guy
who looks the other way.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.497
No, I'm not.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.708
I did pro bono work for Lambda.

08:19.791 --> 08:24.713
I avoid Chick-fil-A and those
delicious honey-butter biscuit sandwiches.

08:24.796 --> 08:28.341
I even got a plaque for my many
contributions to marriage equality.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.051
You wouldn't even hang it up in here.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.053
Well, it didn't go with our decor!

08:32.137 --> 08:34.931
Robert, all those years
we were scared to come out,

08:35.015 --> 08:39.227
other people weren't just out,
they were out fighting.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.896
Fighting for these rings on our fingers.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.899
But we're on the other side of that now.

08:44.983 --> 08:50.030
Not if a bunch of gay men and women can't
put on a play without being harassed.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.490
We need to do something.

08:52.574 --> 08:56.411
I just don't think
we should be making ourselves targets.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.455
We already are.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.881
Did you know
that nutrition labels list ingredients

09:07.964 --> 09:11.509
in order of which ingredient
is in the food the most?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.136
-Yes.
<i>-Oh, I always thought</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:17.348
it was in order of appearance,
like on<i> Murder, She Wrote.</i>

09:17.432 --> 09:20.643
What is all that noise?
Are you making rain sticks again?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.021
No. I'm throwing away all my junk food.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.481
<i>It all has to go:</i>

09:24.564 --> 09:28.693
the tots, fluffs, puffs... pepper.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.195
Why are you throwing out the pepper?

09:30.278 --> 09:34.074
It's a known associate of salt,
which is almost as bad as sugar.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.534
Well, sugar in some moderation is not--

09:36.618 --> 09:41.581
No! Sugar turns into saturated fats,
Brianna! Read the literature.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.416
Mom?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.211
Oh, honey, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to yell.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.421
How are you? How's Baltimore?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.589
Uh...

09:49.672 --> 09:53.968
Annoyingly quaint, overly friendly,
a center of crime,

09:54.052 --> 09:55.720
and reeking of Old Bay Seasoning.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.138
And Barry?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.265
<i>Well, he's technically</i>
<i>still seeing someone else.</i>

09:59.349 --> 10:02.769
But I'm trying to get him
to drop all of his stupid scruples

10:02.852 --> 10:03.853
and just sleep with me.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
So a work-in-progress?

10:06.022 --> 10:09.567
Yeah. But I swear, I will come back
this second if you need me to.

10:09.651 --> 10:10.777
<i>No, no, no. I'm good.</i>

10:10.860 --> 10:12.821
Come back when you've worked things out.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.782
I mean, I don't know, it might be a while.
He has a lot of scruples.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.702
<i>-Miss you.</i>
-Miss you, too. Bye-bye. Mwah.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.001
I'm throwing it all away.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.587
Wow, look at you go.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.090
Even your tub o' pretzels.

10:32.173 --> 10:36.636
I started reading labels and do you know
what's in every processed food?

10:36.719 --> 10:37.720
Death.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.806
That's the spirit.

10:39.889 --> 10:43.184
That article you emailed
sent me down a heart-healthy wormhole.

10:43.268 --> 10:47.564
Did you know there is still plaque in
our arteries from food we ate as children?

10:48.273 --> 10:52.026
The hamburgers I slammed when I was five
are still in me.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.655
Well, that's as interesting
as it is disturbing.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.992
I know. And you'll be happy to hear

10:59.075 --> 11:02.537
I talked to Jacob about Santa Fe
and we're gonna take the train.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.582
You are?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.500
That way I'll be able to walk the aisles.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.587
Oh, no, who am I kidding, I'll be
in the dining car most of the time.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.506
But I tend to hang out
at the snack counter, so I'll be standing.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.675
No clots.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.261
-You're going?
-Just to help Jacob get settled.

11:19.095 --> 11:22.015
And that way it'll give me a chance
to see if I like it.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.935
So moving there is still a possibility?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.478
Why wouldn't it be?

11:29.480 --> 11:33.568
Well, I don't know, maybe this isn't,
you know, a very good time.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.944
Because...?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.450
Because, moving and uprooting
your whole life right now,

11:40.533 --> 11:41.743
after what's just happened?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.202
Could be really good for me?

11:43.286 --> 11:47.332
Frankie, if something were to happen,
you'd be all alone.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
Don't you want to be
with people who love you?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.418
I'll have Jacob.

11:51.461 --> 11:55.381
But what about Coyote,
and Bud, and Sol, and me,

11:55.465 --> 11:58.009
and Eleanor from Trader Joe's--

11:58.092 --> 12:00.970
Eleanor doesn't work there anymore.
I don't know where she went.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.932
Well, Frankie,
you've already had two strokes

12:04.015 --> 12:07.310
and the odds are high you're going
to have another one. Think about it.

12:08.353 --> 12:13.441
You know, I thought you'd be happy for me,
but you just keep bringing me down.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.212
What the hell are you doing here?

12:34.295 --> 12:35.546
-Can I come in?
-No!

12:35.630 --> 12:37.298
Thanks. I brought Kooky some nuts.

12:37.382 --> 12:40.718
Well, Kooky had a mini stroke
and she's not allowed to eat nuts.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.304
I'm sorry. Is she okay?

12:43.388 --> 12:46.057
-Yes. I'd like you to leave.
-You just invited me in.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.728
Would you stop playing games with me?
Things are hard enough right now.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.564
I can't even work
because of your cease-and-desist.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.525
I just wanted to see you.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.861
Look, Grace,
my original offer still stands.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.531
Have dinner with me. One little dinner.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.493
I'll drop our vibrator, nobody sues
anybody, and we all go on with our lives.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.497
And what do you expect to get
out of this dinner that will never happen?

13:09.580 --> 13:10.665
Nothing untoward.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.836
I want us to get to know each other.
Come on... one dinner.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.380
That's all I'd have to do
and you'd drop everything?

13:17.463 --> 13:19.674
Stay out of my business? My life?

13:19.757 --> 13:20.758
Yes.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.387
-I'll give you one lunch.
-Early dinner.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.722
Late lunch.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.974
-Done. In New York.
-San Diego.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.143
-Fine. We'll still take my plane.
-No plane.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.729
No helicopter, no boat,
I will drive myself.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.772
I'll pick you up.
I have to pay my driver anyway.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.441
-Fine.
-Three-course meal.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.319
Two courses.
Cold appetizer, hot entree, no dessert.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.155
Hot appetizer, hot entree, cheese plate.
Not really a dessert.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.574
Fine. Door-to-door, two hours.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.867
Deal.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.618
Deal.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.122
Why are we doing this?

13:51.205 --> 13:52.749
Because I can't get you out of my head.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.417
Then you should get a new head.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.587
I would, but I have great hair.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.677
I mean, do you spend every moment
worrying about your health?

14:04.761 --> 14:07.555
Is it something everyone else does
that I should have been doing?

14:07.638 --> 14:10.224
-I don't think everybody--
-Because it's exhausting.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.518
Or maybe I have Epstein-Barr now, too.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.230
My brother-in-law is a heart surgeon.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.357
I know it's not exactly
the right specialist,

14:18.441 --> 14:22.403
but he said he'd be happy to talk to you
about your health worries anytime.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.407
I wouldn't know where to begin. I've got
so much going on in my head right now.

14:26.491 --> 14:30.661
Did you know when you have two strokes,
the third is statistically inevitable?

14:30.745 --> 14:32.455
I thought you broke up with Dr. Oz.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.458
I'm referencing another medical expert.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.168
An impossibly thin one.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.461
Ah.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.672
-It's Grace.
-Yeah, I got it.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.010
But maybe you should talk
to a real expert.

14:46.094 --> 14:50.098
Santa Fe has got
some first-class hospitals,

14:50.181 --> 14:52.934
and there's a really impressive
neurology institute in Phoenix.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.727
In Phoenix?

14:54.811 --> 14:57.146
So when I have my inevitable third stroke

14:57.230 --> 14:59.899
and my kids have to drop everything
to come to Santa Fe,

14:59.982 --> 15:02.026
I'm already dead in Phoenix?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.238
And they never got a chance
to say goodbye.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.156
I think we tell them
to go straight to Phoenix.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.827
Why are we talking about dying?

15:10.910 --> 15:14.622
Because Grace sent me an article that said
when I have the third stroke,

15:14.705 --> 15:18.167
there's a 50 percent chance
it will be fatal.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.045
We've got to get you out of here.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.549
-Oh, God.
-Find you new things to get excited about.

15:24.632 --> 15:29.595
Santa Fe has a renowned
velvet painting museum.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.806
God, I love velvet paintings.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.308
But all that time standing on my feet.

15:34.392 --> 15:38.062
Fine, then we'll just sit
and watch the sunset.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.273
Sitting's a problem, now, too.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.485
Frankie, you're not always
gonna feel this way.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.824
I can't go to Santa Fe.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.077
Maybe this isn't the best time
to talk about it.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.414
Why don't you take some time
and let all this settle in.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.250
-I'll wait.
-I don't want you to wait for me,

15:59.333 --> 16:02.795
-'cause I don't know when I'll be ready.
-It doesn't matter. It...

16:03.838 --> 16:06.382
-There's no rush.
-It does matter.

16:08.384 --> 16:13.014
I don't think I can deal with the stress
of picking up my entire life

16:13.097 --> 16:16.684
and moving to a place
where I don't know anyone.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.480
I'm too old and too tired now.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.024
I need to be here.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.944
If something happens, I need to be here.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.196
Frankie...

16:29.780 --> 16:31.324
Jacob, I love you.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.576
I love you, too.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.119
I know.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.832
But I just can't do it.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.502
I'm so, so sorry.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.560
You going?

17:00.311 --> 17:01.229
Yeah.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.773
Is everything okay?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.316
Not really.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.153
She's not coming with me.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.821
What?

17:12.698 --> 17:13.574
She said that?

17:14.742 --> 17:15.952
Yeah.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.830
Jacob, I know it's disappointing,

17:19.914 --> 17:22.250
but this isn't the right time
to take a trip--

17:22.333 --> 17:25.002
She meant... ever.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.420
Oh.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.881
Oh.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.969
You sent her all that stuff
and it scared the shit out of her.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.428
Well, that wasn't my intention.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.098
It doesn't matter what you intended,
it's what you did.

17:38.516 --> 17:40.726
I just wanted her to get better.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.813
I didn't tell her to not ever go.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.107
You can't blame this on me.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.608
Sure I can.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.349
The best bagels in town
are baked by a bigot!

18:27.148 --> 18:30.818
I wish we'd spent five more minutes
working on our chant.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.989
It features strong alliteration
and ends in "bigot." It's perfect.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.451
Does it feel like we're complimenting
his bagels, though?

18:38.534 --> 18:39.577
I mean, it's confusing.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.539
Hey, ladies.
Where'd you buy your chains? Homo Depot?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.083
You've lost over 40 customers so far,

18:46.167 --> 18:49.420
including a very hungry-looking
women's rugby team.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.340
Who cares? I make most of my money
during breakfast,

18:52.423 --> 18:53.924
so this protest of yours

18:54.008 --> 18:58.054
is about as well-timed
and well-choreographed as your show.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.806
Well, you really can't speak
to the dancing in our show

19:00.890 --> 19:03.601
because you entered during a book scene!

19:03.684 --> 19:07.772
And for the record,
our choreographer has won six Tappy's,

19:07.855 --> 19:11.067
which are the greater San Diego area's
community theater awards,

19:11.150 --> 19:12.652
sponsored by Dress Barn.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.445
Dress Barn?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.615
-What, do you all take turns--
-What? Playing dress-up?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.116
Is that the best you've got?

19:19.200 --> 19:22.036
Because every playground bully
in America called,

19:22.119 --> 19:24.997
-they want their pathetic insults back.
-Yeah!

19:25.081 --> 19:27.583
The cops are on their way
and you're all going to jail,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.502
because they love my bagels.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.128
Not for long they don't.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.631
The best bagels in town
are baked by a bigot!

19:33.714 --> 19:37.343
The best bagels in town
are baked by a bigot!

19:46.477 --> 19:47.728
Now...

19:48.187 --> 19:50.398
this was a tough one.

19:50.481 --> 19:53.943
It's a replica of<i> The Pequod,</i>
but I call it <i>The Mariah Carey</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:56.195
because it was top heavy and impossible.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.824
It's great, Dad. Mack will love it.

19:59.907 --> 20:03.619
I'm just thrilled to have another
model-ship enthusiast in the family!

20:03.703 --> 20:06.497
You know, I always had hopes
for you or Brianna,

20:06.580 --> 20:11.377
but you had your dolls and she had that
bizarre dance club she built for spiders.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.591
-You all right?
-Yeah.

20:17.675 --> 20:21.929
Yeah, just thinking about how I'll never
be able to teach Macklin how to do this.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.472
Well, have Mitch come by, I'll show him.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.599
Yeah. Well, he's not around much, so...

20:25.683 --> 20:28.686
Well, believe me,
it's not as hard as it looks.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.982
See? You don't lift the mast
until the very end.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.943
You pull it with the little strings
and the hinges. That's the secret.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.780
But if you want to build the whole shebang
inside the bottle,

20:39.864 --> 20:42.324
-you need these--
-Mitch and I are separating.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.243
Tweezers.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.121
Oh, my God.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.457
Honey, I'm so sorry.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.500
Me, too.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.254
You once said you thought he was
having an affair. Was he?

20:55.337 --> 20:57.631
No. No affairs.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.553
How can he walk away
from a wife and four children?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.972
What kind of a man walks away
from his family?

21:05.055 --> 21:06.932
Actually, it was me.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.059
I asked him for the separation.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.730
-Really?
-Really.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.733
Dad, I was so unhappy.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.359
You're not just protecting him?

21:17.443 --> 21:18.778
I swear.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.863
-It was me.
-All right.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.450
I have to ask...

21:27.495 --> 21:29.497
Are you sure you want to do this?

21:30.206 --> 21:31.332
It's not gonna be easy.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.000
I know, but...

21:34.001 --> 21:36.921
I already feel... lighter.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.381
Like I can breathe again.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.925
I know that feeling.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.593
I'm sure you do.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.721
You know, seeing you so happy
is what helped me get here.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.224
I've been thinking about you a lot
these last few weeks

21:48.307 --> 21:51.018
and how hard it must have been
for you to come out.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.478
Well, it took me long enough.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.188
No, but you did it.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.649
You knew everyone would flip their shit,

21:56.732 --> 21:59.693
but you put yourself out there
and you did what you had to do.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.489
And that's the kind of parent
that I want to be for my kids.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.699
Yeah.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.910
Me, too.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.874
Well, I assume you want me
to represent you.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.544
Maybe Sol?

22:16.627 --> 22:18.295
-Mmm, yeah.
-Yeah.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.880
-That makes more sense.
-Mm-hmm.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.595
All right, I'm here.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.805
I'm glad.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.431
I wasn't sure you'd come.

22:29.515 --> 22:33.227
Well, I have to be sure this happens.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.312
-Sign.
-You don't waste any time.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.273
Why would I? It's the only reason I came.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.317
Thank you.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.111
Now we can date.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.574
I originally come from Connecticut.
I have two siblings.

22:46.657 --> 22:50.327
I'm a Scorpio. Now you go.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.371
-I... like booze.
-Oh.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.833
No, no. We did not negotiate
pre-late lunch drinks.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.961
You're right. I'll just have to pour out
this extremely dry martini

22:59.044 --> 23:01.297
with olives flown in this morning
all the way from Spain.

23:01.380 --> 23:06.093
No. That would be disrespectful
to Spaniards everywhere.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.262
How do you know what I drink?

23:08.345 --> 23:10.180
Because I did a little research on you.

23:10.848 --> 23:11.932
That's terrifying.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.685
-I got the lowdown on Say Grace.
-Oh, did you?

23:14.768 --> 23:19.773
Solid growth ten quarters in a row,
despite the beauty market's volatility.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.401
Well, it's 11 quarters,
but who's counting?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.986
We are. It's so us.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.614
-There's no us.
-Not yet.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.783
Oh, come on, you're not
really interested in me. It's absurd.

23:29.867 --> 23:33.579
Why? I've been into you since the second
I saw you in my conference room.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.956
You're ballsy, beautiful,
and don't suffer fools.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.333
I'm suffering right now.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.209
See there? I love that.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.503
What do you want from me?

23:42.671 --> 23:44.006
I just want you to give me a shot.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.926
Oh, come-- I could be your moth--

23:48.093 --> 23:49.845
Older-- I could be your older sister.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.432
Why is it so hard for you
to believe I like you?

23:53.515 --> 23:55.684
That I might even want
to have a relationship with you?

23:55.768 --> 23:58.896
Guys like you don't know
the first thing about relationships.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.231
-You don't know what I know.
-Well, I know what I know.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.275
If you're an expert, explain them to me.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.321
Oh, God, no. I am a nightmare
when it comes to relationships.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.073
Yeah, well, I read that in the research.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.702
Where are we going?
There's no restaurants out here.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.454
We never said "restaurant,"
we said "food."

24:15.537 --> 24:17.790
I'm meeting all the criteria
of our negotiation.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.959
We're having a little picnic
in a beautiful spot

24:21.043 --> 24:23.045
on top of that mountain.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.966
-We said no helicopter.
-And I am a man of my word.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.679
Wow!

24:32.304 --> 24:33.639
That's...

24:34.640 --> 24:35.516
Wow.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.600
What do you think?

24:38.185 --> 24:42.106
I think I have a friend
who would say this is a sign.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.273
For us?

24:44.108 --> 24:46.026
-For her.
-I'm lost.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.489
May I ask you a strange favor?

24:50.572 --> 24:52.032
My favorite kind.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.660
-Can I borrow this?
-The whole thing?

24:54.743 --> 24:55.828
Mm-hmm.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.538
-Now?
-Well... ish.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.541
You still owe me an hour...
47 minutes.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.542
I'm good for it.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.544
How about we round it up
to an even two hours?

25:03.627 --> 25:04.837
Fine.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.423
-Deal?
-Done.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.136
Thank you.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.847
Thank you so much, Chuck.

25:14.930 --> 25:15.889
My pleasure, Sol.

25:16.515 --> 25:20.018
So you actually own
all the kayaks you rent out?

25:20.102 --> 25:23.814
Yeah, the whole fleet! The sunset
on the water will blow your mind.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.775
-I'd love to see it sometime.
-Boom, check it out. Huh?

25:27.609 --> 25:28.819
-Wow.
-Yeah.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.864
You're really passionate
about San Diego tourism.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.324
We're so blessed
to live in such a beautiful city.

25:34.408 --> 25:37.327
-We really are.
-Jesus Christ, Sol.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.205
- All right, let's move them out of here.
- Wait!

25:40.998 --> 25:41.915
Not without me.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.876
Robert, what are you doing here?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.794
I couldn't let you do it alone, Sol.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.839
Or you, Peter. Or Paul.
Or even you, Steve.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.759
I was wrong, Sol.
This is the right thing to do.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.136
I want to be the kind of man
who does the right thing.

25:54.219 --> 25:59.308
I'm so proud of you. Your mother, however,
is rolling in her grave right now.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.853
Good. So, officer,
if you're taking these men in,

26:02.936 --> 26:04.730
you'll just have to take me in with them.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.648
Yeah, you're not under arrest.

26:06.732 --> 26:10.611
Well, couldn't I just go
in the paddy wagon with them?

26:10.694 --> 26:14.531
It doesn't work that way. This is not one
of San Diego's many convenient shuttles.

26:14.615 --> 26:17.075
I'm really trying
to have a moral victory here.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.702
I feel like you're sandbagging me.

26:18.786 --> 26:22.372
I would love to help a fellow San Diegan,
but I can't arrest you with no cause.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.333
You have cause. I'm protesting!

26:24.416 --> 26:26.460
Uh... technically, you're not.

26:27.503 --> 26:31.006
Very well then.
I can rouse rabble with the best of them.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.549
Give me a minute.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.802
Uh, may I? Thank you.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.231
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

26:48.357 --> 26:50.067
-Climb aboard.
-Thank you.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.027
Come on in here!

26:57.366 --> 26:59.117
Let's get out of here.

27:01.870 --> 27:02.871
Come on, let's go.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.457
Oh, I can't go anywhere.
It's time to do my blood pressure.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.585
No, put down the cuff,
put on your moccasins, and come with me.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.128
-Grace--
-No, stop talking.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.256
This is important. Come on.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.136
Are you going to push me off a cliff?

27:18.220 --> 27:20.639
-Because that would be funny only to you.
-Nope.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.765
Are you sure?

27:21.849 --> 27:25.477
Because there's a little voice inside me
saying, "Run! Before it's too late!"

27:25.561 --> 27:27.688
Ready? Open.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.357
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

27:30.440 --> 27:31.859
Yeah, you like it?

27:31.942 --> 27:34.027
Of course I like it! I love balloons!

27:34.111 --> 27:35.904
I know. That's why I got it for you.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.948
You got this for me?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.908
Well, I re-gifted it. Come on, let's go.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.577
Oh no, I can't go in the thing.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.620
Frankie, if I'm going, you're going.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.581
Oh, you can't go. You hate balloons.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.625
Yeah, I hate balloons,
I hate baskets, I hate fields,

27:48.709 --> 27:51.169
I hate pulling you.
God, why are you so strong?

27:51.253 --> 27:54.548
I'm not strong,
I'm weak and falling apart.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.258
Frankie, get in the basket.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.636
You told me I can't go to Santa Fe,
how could I go up in a balloon?

28:02.014 --> 28:05.559
I was wrong. Okay? And I feel terrible.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.687
I should not have put my fear on you.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.814
What are you so afraid of?

28:11.815 --> 28:14.067
Um...

28:15.402 --> 28:18.739
Waking up and not seeing your hats
in the dishwasher.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.617
Not hearing you singing in your studio.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.286
You know,
"Kris Kross will make you jump jump."

28:26.371 --> 28:31.960
Never again cringing at your
borderline-offensive Jamaican accent.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.754
And...

28:33.837 --> 28:36.965
Why do you think this decision
is so hard for me?

28:37.799 --> 28:41.011
I would miss your love
of color-coding spices,

28:41.094 --> 28:43.805
how you try so hard to be funny.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.559
And the way you can always find my purse.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.313
I know. I'm scared of losing you, too.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.441
But you're not losing me.
I'm not going anywhere.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.777
Oh, Frankie. That's my fault.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.988
You can't not go with Jacob because of me.

29:00.072 --> 29:04.743
You love somebody who loves you.
I don't want you missing out on all that.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.037
You know, get in the hot air balloon

29:07.120 --> 29:09.790
and go to Santa Fe
and do anything you want.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.541
I want to eat salt.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.668
Well, not that.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.004
Get in the balloon, mon.

29:22.511 --> 29:24.638
Let's do it. No fear.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.431
No fear.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.892
Okay.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.353
-Hi.
-Hello.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.437
Hi.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.657
- Fear... Oh, such fear.
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

29:45.450 --> 29:46.994
-Oh, God!
-Whoo!

29:47.077 --> 29:49.371
-Whoo! Here we go!
-Whoo! Whoo!

29:49.454 --> 29:50.372
Oh, my God.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.336
I can't believe it.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.047
Oh, this is amazing.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.509
So is Jacob.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.721
Yeah.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.267
You should go.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.854
Yeah.

30:16.398 --> 30:19.443
Let's just see where the balloon takes us.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.344
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
