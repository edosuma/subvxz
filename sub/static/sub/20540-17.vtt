[cheers and applause]

00:40.033 --> 00:42.600
- Welcome, welcome, welcome

00:42.600 --> 00:44.000
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:44.000 --> 00:45.166
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.233
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:47.233 --> 00:51.300
And look--look, before we begin,
you may remember,

00:51.300 --> 00:54.133
last week
we did a story about coal,

00:54.133 --> 00:56.333
the reason Dick Van Dyke
looked like he spent

00:56.333 --> 00:58.533
all of "Mary Poppins"
in blackface.

00:58.533 --> 00:59.900
Well, you know what,

00:59.900 --> 01:02.800
it turns out that one
of the coal company CEOs

01:02.800 --> 01:05.166
that we mentioned was not
particularly thrilled

01:05.166 --> 01:07.467
with how the piece turned out.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.633
- Comedian John Oliver
is the target of a lawsuit

01:09.633 --> 01:12.867
by one of the country's largest
privately owned coal companies.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.533
Oliver strongly criticized
Murray Energy Corporation

01:15.533 --> 01:18.433
and CEO Robert Murray
Sunday on his HBO show

01:18.433 --> 01:22.166
"Last Night Week--
Last Week Tonight."

01:22.166 --> 01:23.734
- It's true.

01:23.734 --> 01:27.834
We here at the show "Last Night
Week Last Week Tonight"

01:27.834 --> 01:31.066
are currently being sued
by Bob Murray,

01:31.066 --> 01:32.867
CEO of Murray Energy.

01:32.867 --> 01:36.533
And look, I desperately want to
talk to you about this tonight.

01:36.533 --> 01:38.800
But our lawyers have
suggested that the courts

01:38.800 --> 01:41.233
be the venue where we work
this out, and I do get that.

01:41.233 --> 01:44.166
But I promise we will
tell you all about this

01:44.166 --> 01:45.400
as soon as it is over.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.000
And of course, of course,
Mr. Nutterbutter

01:48.000 --> 01:50.734
will get a chance to tell
his side of the story, too.

01:50.734 --> 01:53.033
Of course.
Of course he will.

01:53.033 --> 01:54.533
But for now--

01:54.533 --> 01:57.300
for now, tonight, let's
move on to President Trump,

01:57.300 --> 01:59.467
two words that clearly don't
belong together,

01:59.467 --> 02:00.800
but that we're all somehow

02:00.800 --> 02:02.266
getting used
to hearing out loud,

02:02.266 --> 02:04.266
like "Instagram celebrity"

02:04.266 --> 02:07.100
or "Ansel Elgort."

02:07.100 --> 02:08.834
Now, you may remember
back in May,

02:08.834 --> 02:10.200
Trump suggested on Twitter

02:10.200 --> 02:12.133
that he may have tapes
of his conversations

02:12.133 --> 02:13.834
with deposed FBI Director

02:13.834 --> 02:17.066
and Slender Man alter ego
James Comey.

02:17.066 --> 02:19.867
Well, on Thursday,
Trump finally admitted

02:19.867 --> 02:21.633
that he had no such tapes

02:21.633 --> 02:24.333
and offered up
this rationale for his claim.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.066
- Well, I didn't tape him.

02:26.066 --> 02:27.934
You never know what's
happening when you see

02:27.934 --> 02:30.867
that the Obama administration,
and perhaps longer than that,

02:30.867 --> 02:34.333
was doing all of this
unmasking and surveillance

02:34.333 --> 02:35.967
that you read all about it.

02:35.967 --> 02:38.166
And I've been reading about it
for the last couple of months,

02:38.166 --> 02:42.266
about the seriousness of the--
and horrible situation

02:42.266 --> 02:44.100
with surveillance
all over the place,

02:44.100 --> 02:46.333
and you've been hearing
the word "unmasking,"

02:46.333 --> 02:48.600
a word you probably
never heard before.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.433
So you never know what's out
there, but I didn't tape,

02:51.433 --> 02:54.233
and I don't have any tape,
and I didn't tape.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.333
[laughter]

02:56.333 --> 03:00.000
- What the fuck was that?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.834
Whenever Trump talks,
it's like a cross between

03:01.834 --> 03:04.734
a lottery machine
that spits out words

03:04.734 --> 03:08.066
and a Speak & Spell
that just fell into a toilet.

03:08.066 --> 03:09.367
But--but he wasn't done,

03:09.367 --> 03:10.834
because Trump
had not yet explained

03:10.834 --> 03:13.066
the strategic brilliance
of how his tweet

03:13.066 --> 03:14.900
influenced James Comey.

03:14.900 --> 03:18.266
And just wait for the reporter's
follow-up at the end.

03:18.266 --> 03:21.400
- When he found out that,
uh, I, you know,

03:21.400 --> 03:23.233
that there may be tapes
out there,

03:23.233 --> 03:27.033
whether it's governmental tapes
or anything else and who knows,

03:27.033 --> 03:29.266
I think his story
may have changed.

03:29.266 --> 03:31.500
I mean, you'll have
to take a look at that,

03:31.500 --> 03:34.300
because then he has to tell
what actually took place

03:34.300 --> 03:37.000
at the events,
and my story didn't change.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.066
My story was always
a straight story.

03:39.066 --> 03:42.433
My story was always the truth,
but you'll have to determine

03:42.433 --> 03:45.166
for yourself whether or not
his story changed.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.700
But I did not tape.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.433
- It was a smart way
to make sure he stayed honest

03:48.433 --> 03:50.066
in those hearings.

03:50.066 --> 03:52.967
- Well, uh, it wasn't, uh...

03:52.967 --> 03:55.200
it wasn't very stupid,
I can tell you that.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.200
[laughter]

03:56.200 --> 03:57.233
- Wow.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.900
"It wasn't very stupid."

03:59.900 --> 04:01.500
Let's break down
what just happened there.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.333
First, world-class reporting,
Fox News.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.100
You--you really held
his feet to the fire there.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.767
Second, he seemed
justifiably taken off-guard

04:10.767 --> 04:12.100
by that compliment.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.734
And third, think about
what he just said.

04:14.734 --> 04:17.633
He didn't just casually admit to
misleading the American public.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.633
He also implied
that doing so

04:19.633 --> 04:21.367
may have swayed
Comey's testimony,

04:21.367 --> 04:22.934
which, if that was his intent,

04:22.934 --> 04:24.800
could constitute
witness tampering.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.133
And on top of all that,
he then implied he made Comey

04:27.133 --> 04:29.300
tell the truth
about their conversations,

04:29.300 --> 04:31.934
seemingly verifying
Comey's account,

04:31.934 --> 04:34.667
which is incredibly damaging
to the president.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.767
So, yeah,
Trump might actually be right.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.500
It wasn't "very stupid."

04:38.500 --> 04:41.633
It was extraordinarily stupid.

04:41.633 --> 04:44.133
But all this--
all this served to distract

04:44.133 --> 04:45.633
from the really
important business

04:45.633 --> 04:47.233
going down in Washington
this week

04:47.233 --> 04:49.967
concerning the Senate's new
Obamacare replacement bill,

04:49.967 --> 04:52.033
the Better Care
Reconciliation Act.

04:52.033 --> 04:53.533
It was released on Thursday

04:53.533 --> 04:54.967
ahead of a likely vote
next week,

04:54.967 --> 04:57.166
and was quickly denounced
by many Democrats.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.600
Barack Obama
took to Facebook to say,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.000
"It would raise costs,
reduce coverage,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.900
roll back protections, and
ruin Medicaid as we know it."

05:04.900 --> 05:07.700
And you know what,
obviously Obama objects

05:07.700 --> 05:09.300
to repealing the ACA.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.700
His parents literally
named him after Obamacare.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.433
Of course he would say that.

05:13.433 --> 05:15.133
So put that aside.

05:15.133 --> 05:17.734
But meanwhile, in the Senate,
Chuck Schumer engaged

05:17.734 --> 05:21.033
in some spectacular
prop comedy.

05:21.033 --> 05:24.166
- When the White House passed
their health care bill,

05:24.166 --> 05:26.767
a bill that President Trump
called "mean,"

05:26.767 --> 05:29.000
I thought it wouldn't
be possible

05:29.000 --> 05:32.133
for the Senate Republicans
to conjure up a bill

05:32.133 --> 05:34.100
even worse than that one.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.767
Unfortunately,
that is what they have done.

05:38.767 --> 05:40.266
Here you go.

05:40.266 --> 05:42.300
[camera shutters snapping,
indistinct chatter]

05:45.867 --> 05:48.667
"Meaner."
Can you read it?

05:48.667 --> 05:50.033
Do I have to color it in?

05:50.033 --> 05:51.700
- Yeah, you do.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.734
- How's that?

05:52.734 --> 05:54.533
Right there.
"Meaner."

05:54.533 --> 05:56.533
[laughter]

05:56.533 --> 05:57.667
- Oh, my God.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.000
[cheers and applause]

05:59.000 --> 06:02.700
Now, if political theater
were actual theater,

06:02.700 --> 06:05.000
that was the equivalent of
someone falling to their death

06:05.000 --> 06:07.300
in "Spider-Man:
Turn off the Dark."

06:07.300 --> 06:08.967
Now, as for the contents
of the bill,

06:08.967 --> 06:10.633
it is set to hurt
a lot of people.

06:10.633 --> 06:12.667
Because the BCRA
preserves much

06:12.667 --> 06:14.533
of what was objectionable
in the House bill,

06:14.533 --> 06:15.867
like tax cuts
for the wealthy

06:15.867 --> 06:17.900
and deregulation
that would make it possible

06:17.900 --> 06:20.367
for insurers to drastically
cut their coverage.

06:20.367 --> 06:22.266
And when it comes
to Medicaid spending,

06:22.266 --> 06:24.800
this new version is
in some ways even harsher

06:24.800 --> 06:26.367
than it was before.

06:26.367 --> 06:28.600
- The House bill would end
the Medicaid expansion

06:28.600 --> 06:31.433
in three years,
and give states a block grant

06:31.433 --> 06:33.467
to fund Medicaid
as they see fit.

06:33.467 --> 06:35.233
The Senate version
phases out

06:35.233 --> 06:36.867
Medicaid expansion
more slowly,

06:36.867 --> 06:40.133
starting in 2021,
but makes deeper cuts

06:40.133 --> 06:42.667
to the overall
Medicaid program by sharply

06:42.667 --> 06:45.033
reducing federal funding
over time.

06:45.033 --> 06:48.200
- So the House bill would cut
Medicaid relatively quickly,

06:48.200 --> 06:50.600
whereas the Senate bill
would do it more slowly

06:50.600 --> 06:52.200
but far more drastically.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.367
And both of those options
are deadly.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.100
It's basically choosing between

06:56.100 --> 06:57.934
getting run over
by a drunk driver

06:57.934 --> 07:00.767
or getting run over
by a drunk elephant.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.700
And, you know,
that poor elephant

07:02.700 --> 07:04.133
has been going through
a rough patch

07:04.133 --> 07:05.400
since her divorce.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.700
Oh, that's right,
I said "Her."

07:07.700 --> 07:10.867
#LadyElephantsCanCommit
InvoluntaryManslaughter.

07:10.867 --> 07:12.333
#Feminism.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.500
And--and to be clear--

07:14.500 --> 07:18.266
to be clear, those cuts will
have massive impacts.

07:18.266 --> 07:22.100
Right now, Medicaid covers
20% of all Americans,

07:22.100 --> 07:24.066
49% of births,

07:24.066 --> 07:26.300
60% of children
with disabilities,

07:26.300 --> 07:29.266
and 64% of all
nursing home residents.

07:29.266 --> 07:32.000
So unless you are a professional
beach volleyball player

07:32.000 --> 07:34.867
with a vasectomy,
who is estranged from his family

07:34.867 --> 07:38.133
and who plans to
jump into a volcano at age 35,

07:38.133 --> 07:39.767
you or someone you know

07:39.767 --> 07:42.100
desperately needs
these services.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.667
Now, you may have heard some
Republicans have come out

07:44.667 --> 07:46.600
against this bill
in its current form.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.467
Some, because it's too harsh.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.967
Others,
because it is not harsh enough.

07:50.967 --> 07:54.200
And of course
Ted Cruz is in that group.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.133
Of course he is.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.467
He's the only man in history
whose personality

07:58.467 --> 08:00.800
somehow contracted bedbugs.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.133
But--but I would--
here's the thing.

08:03.133 --> 08:05.266
I would be very careful

08:05.266 --> 08:07.734
relying on those politicians
to hold out.

08:07.734 --> 08:10.600
Just this morning,
Rand Paul suggested he might

08:10.600 --> 08:12.433
vote for the bill
if they needed him,

08:12.433 --> 08:14.767
and Ron Johnson
said he wasn't a no,

08:14.767 --> 08:17.166
he was just
a "not yes yet."

08:17.166 --> 08:19.700
Which isn't so much
a courageous stance

08:19.700 --> 08:23.767
as it is not
a cowardly stance yet.

08:23.767 --> 08:24.967
And that is the sort of thing

08:24.967 --> 08:26.567
that means
you should be very wary

08:26.567 --> 08:29.367
of any coverage
with this kind of tone.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.000
- Today on "Face the Nation,"

08:31.000 --> 08:33.967
the Republican Senate health
care bill is on life support.

08:33.967 --> 08:37.166
- Is the plan to repeal
and replace Obamacare

08:37.166 --> 08:38.767
on life support?

08:38.767 --> 08:42.100
- A Senate plan that, as it
stands, is dead on arrival.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.100
- It would seem,
as things stand right now,

08:45.100 --> 08:48.600
the Republican version of
the bill is dead on arrival.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.834
- Oh, that's great,
it's dead on arrival.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.767
Then kick back and relax,
everyone,

08:52.767 --> 08:55.300
'cause I haven't felt this
confident about an outcome

08:55.300 --> 08:58.266
since Tuesday,
November 8, 2016.

08:58.266 --> 08:59.567
[cheers and applause]

08:59.567 --> 09:00.967
The point is--

09:00.967 --> 09:03.800
the point is,
there is every chance that,

09:03.800 --> 09:06.400
absent huge effort
to stop it,

09:06.400 --> 09:08.200
this bill may well pass.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.133
So resisting complacency
would be,

09:10.133 --> 09:12.600
to borrow
a truly moronic phrase,

09:12.600 --> 09:15.934
"Not very stupid,
I can tell you that."

09:15.934 --> 09:17.734
And now this.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.333
- Talkback callers seem
to be pretty much obsessed

09:27.333 --> 09:29.633
with the train and trolley
in our backyard.

09:29.633 --> 09:33.633
- I would just like to know
whose idea it was

09:33.633 --> 09:36.834
to put a train
in the backyard.

09:36.834 --> 09:39.934
I am trying to watch the news
and hear the weather,

09:39.934 --> 09:41.867
and it's distracting.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.367
- I'm calling
about your train.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.900
Whoo-whoo!

09:45.900 --> 09:48.967
Keep the train rolling, baby.

09:48.967 --> 09:51.734
- How about making
this train go the right way?

09:51.734 --> 09:54.533
The way it's running now
is the wrong way.

09:54.533 --> 09:56.667
- Thank you all
for the choo-choo train.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.166
We don't care if it's going
backwards or frontwards.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.834
We just enjoy it.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.333
- Well, Kurt, that stupid
trolley keeps blowing over

10:04.333 --> 10:06.600
because it's not
supposed to be there.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.133
The train is supposed to be
there, not the trolley.

10:10.133 --> 10:13.400
- Tell that guy complaining
about the trolley being on,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.600
conductor can put
anything on the track

10:15.600 --> 10:17.433
he wants to put on the track.

10:17.433 --> 10:20.166
Shut up and go do your
supper dishes.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.467
- Question: What is going on
with the train?

10:23.467 --> 10:24.734
Why isn't it running?

10:24.734 --> 10:26.834
It hasn't been running in weeks.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.266
- Wah, wah, wah.
The train is not running.

10:29.266 --> 10:31.333
I wish an editor would put
a quarter stick

10:31.333 --> 10:33.533
in that train
and blow it up.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.033
- Oh, yes,
we're calling again.

10:36.033 --> 10:40.533
Your train in the backyard
is not running once again.

10:40.533 --> 10:43.533
- I am so sick of hearing
about these idiots

10:43.533 --> 10:47.867
worrying about the stupid
train in the backyard already.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.433
- I just want to say,
you know, your news show is on

10:50.433 --> 10:52.133
so many times
during the day

10:52.133 --> 10:54.433
that you ought to just take
one of those half hours

10:54.433 --> 10:57.066
and play nothing
but a video

10:57.066 --> 10:59.467
of a train
running around in a circle.

10:59.467 --> 11:02.400
Maybe that would pacify
these idiots who keep calling

11:02.400 --> 11:05.266
every time the train
isn't running.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.133
[cheers and applause]

11:07.133 --> 11:08.867
- Moving on.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.200
For our--for our
main story tonight,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.233
we're going to talk
about vaccines.

11:13.233 --> 11:16.266
Or, as the fun doctor at your
family practice puts it,

11:16.266 --> 11:18.567
"Shots! Shots!
Shots, shots, shots, shots.

11:18.567 --> 11:19.900
"Shots, shots, shots.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.500
Seriously, there will be
a slight pinch."

11:22.500 --> 11:24.100
Now, vaccines are
one of humanity's

11:24.100 --> 11:25.500
most incredible
accomplishments,

11:25.500 --> 11:27.467
and they've saved
millions of lives.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.200
And there was a time
when a new one

11:29.200 --> 11:31.400
was a cause
for huge celebration.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.100
- Dr. Jonas Salk discovers
a vaccine that promises

11:34.100 --> 11:35.834
to wipe out
childhood's crippling

11:35.834 --> 11:38.633
and killing enemy, polio.

11:38.633 --> 11:41.266
Anxious parents
are thrilled and grateful,

11:41.266 --> 11:43.734
responding to one of
the greatest mass inoculations

11:43.734 --> 11:45.233
in medical annals.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.700
- It's true, people lined up
for the polio shot

11:47.700 --> 11:49.200
like it was an iPhone.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.066
Although--although for
the record, polio was never

11:52.066 --> 11:54.000
"childhood's
most crippling enemy."

11:54.000 --> 11:56.300
Because that was,
and will forever remain,

11:56.300 --> 11:59.200
accidentally seeing
your father's penis.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.233
[laughter and applause]

12:06.133 --> 12:07.734
But--but despite--

12:07.734 --> 12:11.133
despite their success,
small groups are both skeptical

12:11.133 --> 12:13.667
and vocal about vaccines,
which is nothing new,

12:13.667 --> 12:16.000
but these days,
their voice has been amplified

12:16.000 --> 12:17.467
by the human megaphone

12:17.467 --> 12:19.734
that is the President
of the United States.

12:19.734 --> 12:22.333
- I am totally
in favor of vaccines.

12:22.333 --> 12:26.000
But I want smaller doses
over a longer period of time.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.500
Because you take a baby in,
and I've seen it,

12:29.500 --> 12:32.166
and I've seen it,
and I had my children

12:32.166 --> 12:34.300
taken care of
over a long period of time,

12:34.300 --> 12:37.000
over a two or three year period
of time, same exact amount,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.667
but you take this little
beautiful baby, and you pump--

12:40.667 --> 12:43.467
I mean, it looks just like
it's meant for a horse,

12:43.467 --> 12:45.600
not for a child.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.800
- That is Donald Trump
on the campaign trail,

12:48.800 --> 12:50.700
raising doubts
about vaccinations.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.367
And that is a sentiment
that he's also expressed online

12:53.367 --> 12:57.433
with a tweet reading,
"Tiny children are not horses."

12:57.433 --> 13:00.400
And that--that is an assertion
that PolitiFact rates,

13:00.400 --> 13:02.633
"Yeah, I mean,
I guess technically

13:02.633 --> 13:06.333
we've gotta give him
that, but good grief."

13:06.333 --> 13:09.300
And look, look,
you know this, you know this.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.633
It is not wise to take
health care advice

13:11.633 --> 13:13.767
from a man who has
willingly sought care

13:13.767 --> 13:15.133
from this doctor,

13:15.133 --> 13:17.600
who looks like he sneaks
into a Senor Frogs

13:17.600 --> 13:20.066
in the middle of the night
to fuck the mozzarella sticks.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.633
You know that.

13:21.633 --> 13:24.500
But--but it is--it is not just
Trump who is skeptical,

13:24.500 --> 13:26.000
and those concerns
have driven

13:26.000 --> 13:27.567
some people to extremes.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.867
For instance, back in 2011,
some parents made headlines

13:30.867 --> 13:33.433
by taking what they saw
as a more natural route

13:33.433 --> 13:35.033
to immunizing
their children.

13:35.033 --> 13:37.633
- Catherine, we're talking
about parents who are taking

13:37.633 --> 13:42.000
used lollipops, saliva,
and puss-soaked clothing

13:42.000 --> 13:45.467
from complete strangers
and deliberately infecting

13:45.467 --> 13:47.367
their children.

13:47.367 --> 13:48.667
- Okay, okay, all right.

13:48.667 --> 13:50.967
So, setting aside
the grossness

13:50.967 --> 13:52.734
of parents
infecting their kids

13:52.734 --> 13:54.567
with lollipops from strangers,

13:54.567 --> 13:57.233
that graphic has
an unfortunate misspelling,

13:57.233 --> 14:01.400
because "swapping spit
and passing puss"

14:01.400 --> 14:03.533
sounds like the sex talk

14:03.533 --> 14:06.600
that Kid Rock
would give his teenage son.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.367
"Look, bro, I know you're
gonna wanna swap some spit

14:09.367 --> 14:12.066
"and pass some puss,
but if you don't throw

14:12.066 --> 14:13.533
"a raincoat
on that devil dog,

14:13.533 --> 14:16.033
"it's gonna be scorch city
for you, buckaroo.

14:16.033 --> 14:19.333
This was quality time.
We just had some quality time."

14:19.333 --> 14:21.266
And while it is important
to remember

14:21.266 --> 14:23.600
that the vast majority
of parents

14:23.600 --> 14:26.734
are making sure that their
children get vaccinated on time,

14:26.734 --> 14:29.333
the voices of those
who don't carry.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.533
Any Internet search about
vaccines will quickly lead you

14:32.533 --> 14:34.266
down a frightening
rabbit hole.

14:34.266 --> 14:36.800
And the background hum
of doubt can make some parents

14:36.800 --> 14:39.166
understandably nervous.

14:39.166 --> 14:42.433
- I'm concerned about
how many vaccines

14:42.433 --> 14:45.300
we have to give
our children at once.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.567
- So I'm kind of
debating whether--

14:47.567 --> 14:50.500
I will do them,
but I'm debating the age.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.967
When should
I have them done?

14:51.967 --> 14:53.400
- There's just so much
information there,

14:53.400 --> 14:55.100
and I don't--
I don't know who to ask.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.033
I don't know if there's--

14:57.033 --> 15:00.600
you know, there's no such thing
as an unbiased source.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.233
- At least 10% of parents
delay or skip some shots.

15:05.233 --> 15:08.467
Around 1%
don't vaccinate at all.

15:08.467 --> 15:11.433
- Right, and, you know,
parents get so much information,

15:11.433 --> 15:13.266
it is hard to know what to do.

15:13.266 --> 15:14.734
Should you vaccinate?

15:14.734 --> 15:16.200
Should you eat the placenta?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.166
Should you let kids cry?

15:18.166 --> 15:19.667
And the answer to those,
by the way,

15:19.667 --> 15:22.233
are yes, no, and absolutely.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.900
Because the more they cry now,
the more they'll be prepared

15:24.900 --> 15:27.367
to watch "This Is Us"
when they get older.

15:27.367 --> 15:29.400
[laughter]

15:34.367 --> 15:37.300
And this--this atmosphere
of confusion about vaccines

15:37.300 --> 15:38.867
has caused real problems.

15:38.867 --> 15:41.300
There are now 11 states
where the number

15:41.300 --> 15:43.133
of unvaccinated kids
is on the rise.

15:43.133 --> 15:45.200
And in small pockets
all over America,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.400
the numbers can get
startlingly high.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.767
In the Somali community
in Minnesota,

15:49.767 --> 15:51.400
the measles vaccination rate
for children

15:51.400 --> 15:53.700
dropped to just 42%,

15:53.700 --> 15:56.600
and that had some
very real consequences.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.867
- Measles, once eradicated
in the U.S.,

15:58.867 --> 16:02.000
is now exploding in
Minnesota's Somali community,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.066
where many parents
won't vaccinate.

16:04.066 --> 16:07.166
- The virus is so contagious
that if you're exposed to it

16:07.166 --> 16:08.967
and you don't have
the vaccine,

16:08.967 --> 16:12.133
there's a 90% chance
you'll contract it.

16:12.133 --> 16:14.000
- They can have permanent
brain damage.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.133
They can have blindness
or deafness.

16:16.133 --> 16:20.033
And so we wouldn't vaccinate if
this was just a rashy illness.

16:20.033 --> 16:22.300
This is a very
serious disease.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.266
- Exactly, and this is
how bad it is.

16:24.266 --> 16:26.900
In that community,
the number of measles cases

16:26.900 --> 16:29.500
so far this year
has already outpaced

16:29.500 --> 16:32.734
the total number
in all the U.S. last year.

16:32.734 --> 16:35.266
And that is terrible,
because the only thing

16:35.266 --> 16:37.867
Minnesota should have
more of than any other state

16:37.867 --> 16:39.467
is Garrisons Keillor

16:39.467 --> 16:42.834
and people disappointed by
the Mall of America.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.600
"Oh, so it's
just a bigger mall,

16:45.600 --> 16:48.300
"and it has two
Build-a-Bear Workshops?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.967
"That's amazing.

16:50.967 --> 16:53.633
"This memory will last me
a lifetime.

16:53.633 --> 16:56.367
"As will these two bears

16:56.367 --> 17:00.166
from two different
Build-a-Bear Workshops."

17:00.166 --> 17:04.233
So--so tonight, we are going to
look at why these fears persist

17:04.233 --> 17:06.166
and what the consequences
of succumbing to them can be.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.600
And before we start,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.000
I kind of get why vaccines
can creep people out.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.166
Vaccination can mean
getting injected

17:13.166 --> 17:15.700
by a needle
filled with science juice.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.734
Although, pretty much
every medical practice

17:18.734 --> 17:21.133
sounds terrifying when
you break it down like that.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.934
An appendectomy
means removing

17:22.934 --> 17:25.300
one of your organs
through stabbery.

17:25.300 --> 17:29.000
Antibiotics are poisons used
to murder things living in you.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.700
And even exercise means

17:30.700 --> 17:32.433
forcefully burning up
your insides.

17:32.433 --> 17:35.500
My point is, the human body
is a true carnival of horrors,

17:35.500 --> 17:38.166
and frankly I'm embarrassed
to have one.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.767
And much--much of the fear
surrounding vaccines stems

17:41.767 --> 17:44.133
from their supposed link
to autism.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.900
Now, that is a theory
that gained traction

17:45.900 --> 17:47.834
in the late '90s,
thanks to a study

17:47.834 --> 17:50.133
published in the medical journal
"The Lancet,"

17:50.133 --> 17:51.900
suggesting a link
between autism

17:51.900 --> 17:53.367
and the MMR vaccine.

17:53.367 --> 17:56.233
The study was of just
12 children,

17:56.233 --> 17:58.934
and it was by this guy,
Andrew Wakefield.

17:58.934 --> 18:00.567
And if you're wondering
why I didn't say

18:00.567 --> 18:04.033
"Dr. Andrew Wakefield,"
this is why.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.667
- Follow-up studies
of hundreds

18:05.667 --> 18:08.433
of thousands of children
could not find any evidence

18:08.433 --> 18:11.533
that the MMR vaccine
causes autism.

18:11.533 --> 18:14.500
And investigations into
Wakefield's original paper

18:14.500 --> 18:17.600
revealed he distorted the data
and acted unethically.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.800
- He's lost
his medical license.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.033
"The Lancet" paper
has been retracted.

18:22.033 --> 18:24.734
- It's true, Wakefield made
a big splash before having

18:24.734 --> 18:27.033
his legacy tarnished
and his title revoked.

18:27.033 --> 18:30.467
He's basically
the Lance Armstrong of doctors.

18:30.467 --> 18:33.433
But--but even though
Wakefield's conclusions

18:33.433 --> 18:37.100
have been debunked many times,
he not only denies wrongdoing,

18:37.100 --> 18:38.800
he actually still gives talks

18:38.800 --> 18:41.633
about the supposed dangers
of the MMR vaccine.

18:41.633 --> 18:46.667
In fact, this is him in 2011
talking to the Somali community

18:46.667 --> 18:48.700
that we saw earlier
in Minnesota

18:48.700 --> 18:50.767
and presumably
ending his speech with,

18:50.767 --> 18:53.834
"Trust me.
I'm a used-to-be-a-doctor."

18:53.834 --> 18:57.300
And to be fair,
Wakefield is not the only voice

18:57.300 --> 18:58.867
raising alarms about vaccines.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.600
He has company from across
the political spectrum

19:01.600 --> 19:04.233
from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
on the left,

19:04.233 --> 19:07.934
to Alex Jones
wherever the fuck he fits in,

19:07.934 --> 19:09.967
to even this guy.

19:09.967 --> 19:12.767
- You can't make, um--you
can't make people do procedures

19:12.767 --> 19:14.300
that they don't want.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.100
The parents have to be
the ones who make the decisions

19:16.100 --> 19:18.400
for what's best for my--
for our kids.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.000
It can't be the government
saying that.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.367
It's against
the Nuremberg Laws.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.700
- Yes,
that is Rob Schneider,

19:24.700 --> 19:26.133
performing
an impromptu rendition

19:26.133 --> 19:27.467
of his famous character

19:27.467 --> 19:29.500
"the Annoying Guy
Who is Wrong."

19:29.500 --> 19:33.734
Because--because despite
his misunderstanding of,

19:33.734 --> 19:37.300
among other things,
what the Nuremberg Laws are

19:37.300 --> 19:40.800
and what constitutes acceptable
headwear for a grown man,

19:40.800 --> 19:42.500
Schneider has
spoken out against

19:42.500 --> 19:45.000
mandatory vaccines for years,
even once calling

19:45.000 --> 19:46.800
this California state
assemblywoman

19:46.800 --> 19:48.266
to debate the issue,

19:48.266 --> 19:50.000
prompting her
to post on Facebook,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.500
"Let's be honest.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.100
"That is 20 minutes of my life
I'll never get back

19:54.100 --> 19:56.433
"arguing that vaccines
don't cause autism

19:56.433 --> 19:59.100
with Deuce Bigalow:
Male Gigolo."

19:59.100 --> 20:02.166
Yeah, sure, sure, it's funny.
It's funny.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.867
But, you know, hold on, lady.

20:03.867 --> 20:07.233
Let's not sully the good
name of Deuce Bigalow

20:07.233 --> 20:09.100
just because of something
that his portrayer,

20:09.100 --> 20:10.633
Rob Schneider, said.

20:10.633 --> 20:13.567
That's like implying William
Wallace doesn't trust Jews

20:13.567 --> 20:16.000
or Officer Nordberg
is a murderer.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.734
So, you know,
try and separate the two.

20:18.734 --> 20:22.066
Now--now, the good news is,
these days,

20:22.066 --> 20:25.467
very few people will say they
are completely anti-vaccine.

20:25.467 --> 20:27.567
Instead, like the president,
they'll say,

20:27.567 --> 20:30.400
"I'm not anti-vaccine,
but..."

20:30.400 --> 20:32.900
And it's what
comes after that "but"

20:32.900 --> 20:34.667
that we need
to look at tonight.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.400
'Cause one example is,

20:36.400 --> 20:41.166
"Hey, I'm not anti-vaccine,
but I am pro-safe vaccine."

20:41.166 --> 20:42.867
And that can often
refer to concern

20:42.867 --> 20:44.433
over scary-sounding
ingredients,

20:44.433 --> 20:47.767
like thimerosal,
a mercury-based preservative.

20:47.767 --> 20:51.433
For years now, RFK Jr.
has led a crusade against it.

20:51.433 --> 20:55.400
In fact, just this year, he gave
a speech where he said this.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.033
- For 33 years, I've been
working to get mercury

20:58.033 --> 20:59.467
out of fish.

20:59.467 --> 21:03.400
Nobody has ever
called me anti-fish.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.066
And because I want mercury
out of vaccines,

21:06.066 --> 21:08.367
I should not be
called anti-vaccine.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.600
- Okay, well, for a start,
why would anyone be ashamed

21:11.600 --> 21:14.166
to be called anti-fish?

21:14.166 --> 21:16.500
Fish are stupid.
And how do I know that?

21:16.500 --> 21:19.734
Look at them!
Just look at this idiot!

21:19.734 --> 21:21.266
And it's not just him.

21:21.266 --> 21:23.600
Check this moron out as well.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.166
And while you're at it,
what about this dimwit?

21:26.166 --> 21:28.233
Here's another bonehead for ya.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.867
I'm Pretty sure
this dunce didn't make it

21:29.867 --> 21:31.333
past the third grade.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.166
And I think we can all agree
that this doofus

21:33.166 --> 21:34.800
isn't exactly curing cancer.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.100
Oh, that's right.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.166
Come at me, fish.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.000
Oh, I'm sorry, you can't,
can you?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.867
'Cause--because--
and that's because

21:40.867 --> 21:42.800
after 500 million years,

21:42.800 --> 21:44.934
you still haven't figured out
how to breathe air.

21:44.934 --> 21:46.934
Fuck you, fish.
It's easy.

21:46.934 --> 21:48.133
[panting]

21:48.133 --> 21:51.066
I'm doing it now.

21:51.066 --> 21:52.433
Easy!

21:52.433 --> 21:55.633
You don't know me, fish.
Get outta here.

21:55.633 --> 21:59.300
But, you know,
more importantly--

21:59.300 --> 22:02.767
in fact, much more importantly,
it is worth knowing

22:02.767 --> 22:05.300
that the mercury that has
been used in vaccines

22:05.300 --> 22:08.600
is not the same kind
that is harmful in fish,

22:08.600 --> 22:11.333
on top of which,
as with the MMR vaccine,

22:11.333 --> 22:14.900
there have been multiple large
studies finding no link

22:14.900 --> 22:16.734
between thimerosal and autism.

22:16.734 --> 22:20.333
And perhaps most importantly
of all, since the early 2000s,

22:20.333 --> 22:23.000
as a precautionary measure,
it has been removed

22:23.000 --> 22:24.934
as a preservative
from all vaccines

22:24.934 --> 22:27.667
recommended for infants
except for the flu vaccines.

22:27.667 --> 22:30.934
And even there, thimerosal-free
versions are available.

22:30.934 --> 22:34.600
So we essentially spent time
and energy solving a problem

22:34.600 --> 22:36.166
that never existed.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.800
It's like spending years
fighting to get marshmallows

22:38.800 --> 22:41.266
out of Lucky Charms
because a few people

22:41.266 --> 22:44.600
think Minions
can choke to death on them.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.500
For a start,
marshmallows dissolve,

22:46.500 --> 22:48.233
and Minions don't exist,

22:48.233 --> 22:51.166
and if they did, I would
want them to choke to death,

22:51.166 --> 22:53.367
'cause those little fuckers
will murder us.

22:53.367 --> 22:55.867
Open your eyes.

22:55.867 --> 22:59.500
And look, if you're thinking,
"Well, hold on, hold on.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.533
If it wasn't harmful,
why was it taken out?"

23:02.533 --> 23:04.800
Well, there was intense
public concern

23:04.800 --> 23:06.600
that was amplified by people

23:06.600 --> 23:08.433
like then-Congressman
Dan Burton,

23:08.433 --> 23:10.500
making arguments like this.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.467
- I have yet to find
any scientist who will say

23:13.467 --> 23:16.567
that there is no doubt,
no doubt,

23:16.567 --> 23:19.967
that the mercury in vaccines
does not contribute to autism.

23:19.967 --> 23:21.834
Now, they'll say there's
no scientific evidence.

23:21.834 --> 23:25.033
There's no studies or anything
that proves that yet.

23:25.033 --> 23:27.100
But turn that around.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.300
There are no studies
that disprove it either.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.000
- All right.
All right, okay--

23:32.000 --> 23:34.600
but here's the thing,
proving a negative

23:34.600 --> 23:36.433
is an impossible standard.

23:36.433 --> 23:38.066
And that is also
a slippery slope.

23:38.066 --> 23:40.000
Because it means
that I can say to you,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.533
"You, Dan Burton,
are a donkey fucker.

23:43.533 --> 23:45.900
"You dress up donkeys
in cheerleader outfits

23:45.900 --> 23:47.500
"and you fuck them.

23:47.500 --> 23:51.166
It's what you're into,
and you do it all the time."

23:51.166 --> 23:52.800
And you will say to me,

23:52.800 --> 23:56.333
"Well, wait, there is absolutely
no evidence of me doing that."

23:56.333 --> 23:59.567
But I would say,
turn that around.

23:59.567 --> 24:02.500
There's no evidence of you
not doing that either.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.834
See, Dan?

24:03.834 --> 24:07.567
This is not a road
that you want to go down.

24:07.567 --> 24:09.100
And the thing is--

24:09.100 --> 24:11.633
the thing is,
that donkey-fucker's remarks

24:11.633 --> 24:13.934
actually get at why scientists

24:13.934 --> 24:15.934
can be at a real disadvantage
in this debate.

24:15.934 --> 24:17.767
Because they,
by their nature,

24:17.767 --> 24:20.734
are careful in how they present
their conclusions.

24:20.734 --> 24:24.200
- Science and English are not
really the same language.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.300
And so when a scientist says,

24:27.300 --> 24:30.200
"We have no evidence
that there's a link

24:30.200 --> 24:31.767
between vaccines
and autism,"

24:31.767 --> 24:33.767
what they're really
saying is,

24:33.767 --> 24:36.900
"You know, we are as
positive as someone

24:36.900 --> 24:40.133
can humanly be
that there's no link."

24:40.133 --> 24:43.166
And one thing
that I sometimes do

24:43.166 --> 24:45.000
when I'm talking
to parents is say,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.166
"I'm as confident
that there's no link

24:47.166 --> 24:50.066
between vaccines
and autism as I am

24:50.066 --> 24:52.200
that if I was going
to walk off this building

24:52.200 --> 24:53.767
that I would
not be able to fly."

24:53.767 --> 24:57.600
- Right, and that is
about as clear as you can be.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.700
And for the record,
if your doctor

24:59.700 --> 25:02.266
does believe
they can fly, run.

25:02.266 --> 25:05.533
Because they are either crazy,
or they are R. Kelly.

25:05.533 --> 25:09.700
And if your--if your
pediatrician is R. Kelly,

25:09.700 --> 25:13.133
vaccines are actually
the least of your problems then.

25:13.133 --> 25:15.400
And I know--
I know that some will say

25:15.400 --> 25:17.000
that the real problem
is that scientists

25:17.000 --> 25:18.767
are being paid
by pharma companies

25:18.767 --> 25:20.433
to hide the problems
with vaccines.

25:20.433 --> 25:22.800
You can find
countless memes online

25:22.800 --> 25:25.000
about how
the whole system is corrupt,

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
some of which feature
a very smart-looking cat.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.734
And I'm not saying

25:29.734 --> 25:31.600
that there are not problems
with big pharma.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.333
There absolutely are.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.867
We have discussed them
before on this show.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.400
But on the rare occasions
when there have been issues

25:38.400 --> 25:40.934
with vaccines, they have
been pulled and fast.

25:40.934 --> 25:43.066
And I know that
that explanation

25:43.066 --> 25:44.767
will still not satisfy some.

25:44.767 --> 25:47.200
There are going to be
some truly toxic comments

25:47.200 --> 25:48.967
below this video,

25:48.967 --> 25:51.934
alongside the usual ones
about how I look like an owl

25:51.934 --> 25:54.133
who can't get a date for prom

25:54.133 --> 25:56.734
or that I probably live alone

25:56.734 --> 26:00.166
surrounded by jars
I'm too weak to open by myself.

26:00.166 --> 26:02.400
And--and the thing--
and the thing--

26:02.400 --> 26:05.367
You're laughing too hard
at that.

26:05.367 --> 26:08.400
And those comments will link
to "the hidden truths"

26:08.400 --> 26:10.133
about vaccines,
and demand to know

26:10.133 --> 26:11.967
why I didn't look into them,
and you know what?

26:11.967 --> 26:14.500
We did look into a lot of them,
and the problem is,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.867
I could go
point by point by point

26:16.867 --> 26:18.400
and be talking
for hours tonight,

26:18.400 --> 26:20.433
and this will still never end.

26:20.433 --> 26:21.834
It's like Whac-A-Mole.

26:21.834 --> 26:24.467
As one theory goes down,
another pops up.

26:24.467 --> 26:27.633
And I kind of get the insistence
that there must be a link.

26:27.633 --> 26:30.934
The age children are supposed
to get the MMR vaccine

26:30.934 --> 26:34.066
happens to be the same age that
diagnosable signs of autism

26:34.066 --> 26:35.266
can begin to appear,

26:35.266 --> 26:37.867
but correlation
is not causation.

26:37.867 --> 26:40.533
That is what
scientific studies are for.

26:40.533 --> 26:42.867
And remember,
they are really clear.

26:42.867 --> 26:45.633
That link is not there.

26:45.633 --> 26:49.600
And the problem with spending
more and more time and money

26:49.600 --> 26:53.066
trying to prove that link is
that it takes resources away

26:53.066 --> 26:55.700
from studying actual causes
and treatments.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.667
Just listen to the mother
of one child with autism

26:58.667 --> 27:02.066
who started a foundation
precisely because she wanted

27:02.066 --> 27:03.767
to find out the causes.

27:03.767 --> 27:06.767
- We have dozens of studies.

27:06.767 --> 27:09.000
I think we were right to look
at whether vaccines

27:09.000 --> 27:10.800
might be a cause of autism,

27:10.800 --> 27:15.533
but there comes a point where
there is so much evidence,

27:15.533 --> 27:19.233
none of which shows any link
between vaccines and autism,

27:19.233 --> 27:21.834
that you have to say,
"Enough."

27:21.834 --> 27:23.266
- Yeah, that's right.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.667
It's like that Einstein quote

27:24.667 --> 27:26.533
you sometimes see
on the Internet.

27:26.533 --> 27:29.200
"The definition of insanity
is doing the same thing

27:29.200 --> 27:32.166
over and over again and
expecting different results."

27:32.166 --> 27:34.433
Except Einstein
didn't say that,

27:34.433 --> 27:36.900
because, and it seems
I cannot stress this enough,

27:36.900 --> 27:40.000
memes aren't facts.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.834
And if you won't
take that from me,

27:41.834 --> 27:46.200
take it from
this very smart-looking cat.

27:46.200 --> 27:50.667
But again, that hum of doubt
is hard to shake off.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.834
And some parents agree
with the president,

27:52.834 --> 27:54.867
and they favor
hedging their bets

27:54.867 --> 27:58.767
and skipping or spacing vaccines
out just in case.

27:58.767 --> 28:01.333
93% of pediatricians say

28:01.333 --> 28:04.033
they've been asked
by parents to do just that.

28:04.033 --> 28:06.567
And one of the places that
that idea may be coming from

28:06.567 --> 28:08.533
is a pediatrician
named Dr. Sears.

28:08.533 --> 28:11.333
Not Bill Sears,
the famous doctor and author.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.433
But his son, Bob Sears.

28:13.433 --> 28:15.300
Dr. Bob has made
a name for himself

28:15.300 --> 28:18.133
with what can seem like
a sensible-sounding approach

28:18.133 --> 28:20.567
to address
worried parents' concerns.

28:20.567 --> 28:22.166
- What I've put together
is what I call

28:22.166 --> 28:24.900
my alternative vaccine schedule.

28:24.900 --> 28:27.967
It's a way to get
a baby fully vaccinated

28:27.967 --> 28:31.300
but in a manner that spreads
the shots out a little bit.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.667
- And that sounds like
a decent compromise,

28:33.667 --> 28:36.233
because it's the middle
ground position, right?

28:36.233 --> 28:38.233
The problem is,
it's the middle ground

28:38.233 --> 28:40.867
between sense and nonsense.

28:40.867 --> 28:43.066
It's like saying,
"It would be crazy to eat

28:43.066 --> 28:44.567
"that entire bar of soap,

28:44.567 --> 28:47.633
so I'll just
eat half of it."

28:47.633 --> 28:51.333
Now, the enthusiasm
for spacing vaccines out

28:51.333 --> 28:52.867
stems from some
parents' belief

28:52.867 --> 28:55.500
that children these days
get too many shots too soon,

28:55.500 --> 28:58.333
perhaps best summed up
by this meme of a doll

28:58.333 --> 28:59.667
full of needles.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.834
And I will say, if that's how
they were given,

29:01.834 --> 29:04.200
I would oppose that.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.367
But--but let's break
that fear down,

29:06.367 --> 29:08.667
because while it is true
that children do receive

29:08.667 --> 29:10.367
more shots than they used to,

29:10.367 --> 29:12.533
the number of antigens
in those shots,

29:12.533 --> 29:15.200
or the substances that
induced the immune response,

29:15.200 --> 29:16.700
has greatly decreased.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.233
And it's a drop in the ocean

29:18.233 --> 29:20.600
compared to the thousands
of foreign antigens

29:20.600 --> 29:22.467
a child usually
encounters every day.

29:22.467 --> 29:25.000
Just watch a child
for five minutes,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.567
and see if they don't
eat their friend's boogers,

29:27.567 --> 29:30.467
put their entire mouth
over the water fountain,

29:30.467 --> 29:32.600
or try and kiss a raccoon
they just found

29:32.600 --> 29:34.900
in a dumpster
while playing hide and seek.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.900
My point is,
children are fucking disgusting.

29:38.900 --> 29:42.934
And even Sears himself has
admitted that his approach

29:42.934 --> 29:45.567
is not based on
scientific research.

29:45.567 --> 29:48.734
- So, where is the--
where is the published,

29:48.734 --> 29:51.700
peer-reviewed evidence
to support the notion

29:51.700 --> 29:53.300
of a, quote, "overload"

29:53.300 --> 29:55.800
if you follow
the CDC-recommended schedule?

29:55.800 --> 29:57.934
Where does that exist?

29:57.934 --> 30:01.533
- Chris, I don't think
there is any such research,

30:01.533 --> 30:04.400
and I actually never
claimed there was.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.900
I certainly have
put out there very clearly

30:06.900 --> 30:09.500
in my writings
that my precautions

30:09.500 --> 30:12.400
on spreading out vaccines
are theoretical.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.934
It's a theoretical benefit
to kids,

30:14.934 --> 30:16.300
and it's a choice
that I think

30:16.300 --> 30:18.767
a lot of parents feel
more comfortable about

30:18.767 --> 30:20.800
and might actually bring
more parents

30:20.800 --> 30:23.667
to vaccinate if they can
spread the shots out more

30:23.667 --> 30:25.133
than the regular schedule.

30:25.133 --> 30:26.600
- Right.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.166
Except your job is
to make sure children

30:29.166 --> 30:30.934
don't get deadly diseases,

30:30.934 --> 30:32.800
not to make
parents comfortable.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.633
Because you're
a pediatrician,

30:34.633 --> 30:37.834
not a flask of whiskey
tucked into a Babybjorn.

30:37.834 --> 30:39.533
And...
[laughter and cheering]

30:39.533 --> 30:41.834
And Dr. Bob sometimes seems

30:41.834 --> 30:43.467
to be trying
to have it both ways.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.767
Because while he says he is
pro-vaccine and that he doesn't

30:46.767 --> 30:50.200
explicitly tell parents to
skip or delay important shots,

30:50.200 --> 30:52.433
his book just happens to include

30:52.433 --> 30:54.400
an "Alternative
Vaccine Schedule"

30:54.400 --> 30:56.734
and a "Selective
Vaccine Schedule."

30:56.734 --> 30:58.834
And on that one,
you can get vaccinated

30:58.834 --> 31:01.500
for measles
as late as ten years old.

31:01.500 --> 31:04.367
And on top of that,
every once in a while,

31:04.367 --> 31:06.467
he'll drop a line like this.

31:06.467 --> 31:11.033
- You know, my statement I like
to make on vaccines and autism

31:11.033 --> 31:15.867
is that vaccines don't cause
autism, except when they do.

31:15.867 --> 31:20.166
- And--and I know that sounds
like equivocating bullshit,

31:20.166 --> 31:21.400
but don't worry.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.300
Opportunistic quacks
writing books

31:23.300 --> 31:25.467
that fan the flames of
people's unfounded fears

31:25.467 --> 31:28.033
don't cause a legitimate
public health hazard,

31:28.033 --> 31:30.533
except when they do.

31:30.533 --> 31:35.800
And--and while the benefits
of Dr. Sears's plan are,

31:35.800 --> 31:37.934
as he says, "theoretical,"

31:37.934 --> 31:41.734
the dangers of spacing
vaccines out are very real.

31:41.734 --> 31:45.066
The CDC says spreading shots out
puts children at risk

31:45.066 --> 31:48.500
of developing diseases during
the time that shots are delayed.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.967
And some of those diseases
are dangerous.

31:50.967 --> 31:53.033
Measles alone was responsible

31:53.033 --> 31:58.000
for over 130,000 deaths
worldwide in 2015,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.233
partly because
it is ridiculously infectious.

32:01.233 --> 32:04.533
I'm talking "Happy"
by Pharell infectious.

32:04.533 --> 32:07.834
I just said that, and it's
already stuck in your head now.

32:07.834 --> 32:10.500
♪ 'Cause I'm happy ♪
There you go.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.133
That's how infectious
measles is.

32:13.133 --> 32:15.834
And one way we can keep
measles at bay is through

32:15.834 --> 32:17.533
something called
"herd immunity."

32:17.533 --> 32:19.166
That is the concept whereby

32:19.166 --> 32:21.133
the more people
who are vaccinated,

32:21.133 --> 32:24.000
the harder it is
for a disease to spread.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.867
But the margin for safety there

32:25.867 --> 32:28.100
is a lot smaller
than you may think.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.700
Most experts say that
the herd immunity threshold

32:30.700 --> 32:33.500
for measles is around 95%.

32:33.500 --> 32:38.400
But when, in France, that
dropped to 89% a few years back,

32:38.400 --> 32:40.200
this is what happened.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.100
- In 2007,
there were around 40 cases

32:43.100 --> 32:45.700
of measles across France.

32:45.700 --> 32:49.367
Then, in 2008,
a ten-year-old girl returned

32:49.367 --> 32:52.600
from holiday in Austria.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.967
She went back to school
and played with some friends.

32:54.967 --> 32:57.000
- ♪ Frere Jacques ♪

32:57.000 --> 33:00.834
- Several days later,
the girls became ill.

33:00.834 --> 33:04.233
The measles infection spread
from district to district,

33:04.233 --> 33:07.300
infecting the susceptible
population.

33:07.300 --> 33:12.400
In 2011, there were
almost 15,000 cases.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.834
At least six people died.

33:14.834 --> 33:17.867
- Okay, so that clip
proves two things to us.

33:17.867 --> 33:19.900
One, a decrease
in herd immunity

33:19.900 --> 33:22.000
can have
devastating consequences,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.166
and two,
anything is terrifying

33:24.166 --> 33:27.867
if you play children singing
"Frere Jacques" underneath it.

33:27.867 --> 33:30.467
I guarantee you that's true.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.633
Just look at what happens when
you add that music underneath

33:33.633 --> 33:35.800
this stock footage
that we found.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.300
- ♪ Frere Jacques ♪

33:38.300 --> 33:41.367
♪ Frere Jacques ♪

33:41.367 --> 33:44.133
♪ Dormez vous ♪

33:44.133 --> 33:47.000
♪ Dormez vous ♪

33:47.000 --> 33:49.233
- There is no way that
those kids are not about

33:49.233 --> 33:51.233
to be decapitated
by a stop sign.

33:51.233 --> 33:53.100
No way.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.700
And--and if you're thinking,

33:55.700 --> 33:57.233
"Well, you know,
that is a chance

33:57.233 --> 33:58.633
"that I'm willing to take,

33:58.633 --> 34:00.834
and I'm just making
this choice for my child,"

34:00.834 --> 34:03.133
the thing is, you're not.

34:03.133 --> 34:06.166
You're putting at risk
kids like Rhett Krawitt.

34:06.166 --> 34:08.233
He was diagnosed with leukemia
at age two,

34:08.233 --> 34:10.166
and his immune system
was weakened so much

34:10.166 --> 34:11.867
he couldn't be vaccinated,

34:11.867 --> 34:13.667
meaning if he picked up
a serious disease,

34:13.667 --> 34:15.033
it could be fatal.

34:15.033 --> 34:17.400
And I'll let his mom
take it from here.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.767
- When he was first diagnosed

34:18.767 --> 34:22.433
he was pretty much
pulled out of society.

34:22.433 --> 34:26.934
We avoided highly
concentrated groups of people.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.133
When we went out,
we wore a mask.

34:29.133 --> 34:31.734
I mean, we really did
limit his exposure.

34:31.734 --> 34:34.433
And we just were
so excited for the day

34:34.433 --> 34:36.100
when he could
start kindergarten

34:36.100 --> 34:38.700
so he could have
that sense of socialization

34:38.700 --> 34:40.767
and community and learning.

34:40.767 --> 34:44.033
- A year into remission
and back in school,

34:44.033 --> 34:47.500
Rhett will soon be healthy
enough to be fully vaccinated.

34:47.500 --> 34:50.133
But until then,
his life depends

34:50.133 --> 34:51.567
on herd immunity.

34:51.567 --> 34:52.734
- Exactly.

34:52.734 --> 34:54.066
So by getting vaccinated,

34:54.066 --> 34:55.500
you're helping
and protecting those

34:55.500 --> 34:57.800
who are most vulnerable,
like sick people,

34:57.800 --> 35:00.000
and newborns too young
to be vaccinated.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.567
And why would you choose
not to do that?

35:02.567 --> 35:06.033
I believe Jesus Christ himself
put it best when he said,

35:06.033 --> 35:08.367
"Do you seriously need
some sort of wise quote

35:08.367 --> 35:09.900
"to convince you
on this one?

35:09.900 --> 35:13.700
Just, like, don't be a dick."

35:13.700 --> 35:16.200
And--and look, I know--

35:16.200 --> 35:20.500
I honestly know, like, for
some people this is still hard.

35:20.500 --> 35:24.066
But what can help is
to try and anchor yourself

35:24.066 --> 35:27.233
to what we know to be true
about the risks of vaccines.

35:27.233 --> 35:31.266
And when it comes to autism,
again, there is no link.

35:31.266 --> 35:33.533
And even when it comes
to other serious side effects,

35:33.533 --> 35:35.500
like a severe
allergic reaction,

35:35.500 --> 35:37.900
it is literally,
according to the CDC,

35:37.900 --> 35:40.066
close to one in a million.

35:40.066 --> 35:42.266
And I know that, in a way,
that's not actually helpful,

35:42.266 --> 35:44.567
because every parent
thinks their child

35:44.567 --> 35:47.333
is one in a million, but if
it makes you feel better,

35:47.333 --> 35:50.133
your child's odds of
being convicted of murder

35:50.133 --> 35:52.233
and eventually executed
by the state

35:52.233 --> 35:55.734
are only 1 in 119,012.

35:55.734 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, and if that makes you
feel even worse, just cheer up.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.934
Maybe your child will be
one of those murderers

36:00.934 --> 36:02.734
that never gets caught.
Maybe.

36:02.734 --> 36:05.734
They're very smart.
Maybe.

36:05.734 --> 36:08.900
And you know, maybe one of
the biggest problems here

36:08.900 --> 36:11.133
is that when people
hear about vaccines,

36:11.133 --> 36:13.734
so much of the emphasis
is on non-existent

36:13.734 --> 36:17.734
or wildly unlikely harms,
and we tend not to talk

36:17.734 --> 36:20.133
about the very tangible good
that they do.

36:20.133 --> 36:22.600
After all, nobody is going on
Facebook to post,

36:22.600 --> 36:24.767
"Didn't get
polio again today!

36:24.767 --> 36:27.300
So lit!"

36:27.300 --> 36:31.667
And maybe we kind of should,
because it is easy to forget

36:31.667 --> 36:35.300
the benefits
of vaccines are enormous.

36:35.300 --> 36:39.200
- What we have seen
in the industrialized world

36:39.200 --> 36:42.834
is, essentially,
all of the major epidemics,

36:42.834 --> 36:44.133
they've vanished.

36:44.133 --> 36:47.700
Moms today have
every expectation

36:47.700 --> 36:50.200
that their beautiful
little baby will live

36:50.200 --> 36:53.567
and not be polished off
by diphtheria,

36:53.567 --> 36:56.600
by tetanus, even
occasionally by measles.

36:56.600 --> 37:00.200
Now that is the transformation
in young lives

37:00.200 --> 37:02.333
that vaccines have wrought.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.433
- And that is
a really good point,

37:04.433 --> 37:08.734
only slightly undercut by him
using the phrase "polished off."

37:08.734 --> 37:12.633
'Cause you're talking about
babies, not a rack of ribs.

37:12.633 --> 37:15.000
But here's the thing,
it really comes down to this.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.800
It is likely
that at some point,

37:16.800 --> 37:18.734
you may hear
scary vaccine stories

37:18.734 --> 37:20.433
from other parents
or on the Internet,

37:20.433 --> 37:24.166
and it is hard not to be
terrified when you encounter it.

37:24.166 --> 37:26.533
And that is partly because
parenthood, in general,

37:26.533 --> 37:28.533
is fucking terrifying.

37:28.533 --> 37:32.066
Believe me, I'm someone who is
scared of literally everything.

37:32.066 --> 37:36.934
The dark, the light, heights,
depths, confined spaces,

37:36.934 --> 37:40.734
wide-open spaces,
strangers, intimacy, spiders,

37:40.734 --> 37:44.867
and a sudden and mysterious
lack of spiders.

37:44.867 --> 37:46.567
But all of that--

37:46.567 --> 37:51.500
but for what it's worth,
and if this helps at all,

37:51.500 --> 37:52.934
I have a son.

37:52.934 --> 37:54.433
He is 19 months old.

37:54.433 --> 37:55.900
He was born prematurely,

37:55.900 --> 37:57.467
following a very difficult
pregnancy,

37:57.467 --> 37:59.300
and I've worried
about his health,

37:59.300 --> 38:01.500
and I still worry
about his health a lot.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.867
But we are vaccinating him
fully on schedule.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.633
And if I can overcome
the temptation

38:07.633 --> 38:10.200
to listen
to the irrational shouting

38:10.200 --> 38:12.333
of my terrified
lizard brain,

38:12.333 --> 38:14.600
then I believe
that everyone can.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.633
And now this.

38:24.700 --> 38:27.400
- Our backyard train
continues to be

38:27.400 --> 38:30.667
a highly debated topic
in Talkback 16.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.834
- I see Kurt in the backyard,

38:32.834 --> 38:36.333
and the train is down
to just the locomotive.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.600
What happened
to the passenger cars?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.266
So much for buying
a new train

38:41.266 --> 38:43.266
that was supposed
to be indoor-outdoor,

38:43.266 --> 38:47.200
weatherproof
with sound and smoke.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.767
- You guys are all talking

38:48.767 --> 38:51.200
about the snowstorm
in the backyard,

38:51.200 --> 38:54.233
and all I can see
is that poor train engine,

38:54.233 --> 38:56.867
the poor little thing
spazzing out,

38:56.867 --> 38:58.700
too worried
about his tracks

38:58.700 --> 39:00.133
getting all covered up.

39:00.133 --> 39:03.066
Can you give him
a little home or something?

39:03.066 --> 39:06.567
- I'd like to see that train
running in the backyard,

39:06.567 --> 39:08.266
even with the snow.

39:08.266 --> 39:09.834
You get
the weatherman out there

39:09.834 --> 39:11.300
to clean that track off,

39:11.300 --> 39:13.667
like we used to do
in the railroad.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.767
- Hi, I just turned
the news on,

39:15.767 --> 39:18.066
and I saw the train running.

39:18.066 --> 39:20.100
I am so, so happy.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.834
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

39:21.834 --> 39:23.800
I could come through the phone
and give you all a big hug,

39:23.800 --> 39:26.567
responsible for that train
being fixed.

39:26.567 --> 39:28.600
- I just want to say
that I've been enjoying

39:28.600 --> 39:30.266
the Talkback 16 segments.

39:30.266 --> 39:33.500
I'd also like to add a theory
that I think Jon Meyer

39:33.500 --> 39:35.533
is the one who is
shutting down the train

39:35.533 --> 39:37.934
in the background
on occasion to distract

39:37.934 --> 39:41.133
from the terrible reviews
he is getting on Talkback 16.

39:41.133 --> 39:44.133
It's just another example
of fake news.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.533
- That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching.

39:47.533 --> 39:49.400
We'll see you next week.
Good night!

39:49.400 --> 39:50.834

39:50.834 --> 39:52.367
Yeah, yeah.
