(JOE WHISTLES)

01:41.977 --> 01:43.403
(HONKS)

01:56.366 --> 01:58.509
JOE: Where's Bailey?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.261
Deaf and dumb, eh?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.776
Can you read lips?

02:19.181 --> 02:21.904
Where is Bailey?

02:23.518 --> 02:25.991
Coming back today?

02:27.272 --> 02:29.415
Come on.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.012
- Hello, Marny.
- Well, look who is back.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.764
- Did you dye your hair?
- Why?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.557
I keep thinking of you as a blond.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.686
For all the thinking you do about
me, I could be bald-headed.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.480
Ham on rye. Did you miss me, honey?

03:09.481 --> 03:12.525
If I didn't, I can't think
of anybody else who did.

03:12.526 --> 03:16.028
- One thing's sure, Bailey don't miss nothing.
- Neither do you.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.072
She's your girl, and
he ain't my man.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.033
So it's no skin off my nose.
I just see what I see.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.952
You sure you don't
see what you hear?

03:22.953 --> 03:26.330
Nothing can happen in this town
that I don't hear about it.

03:26.331 --> 03:30.000
I'm just saying what I see. Every
day they go fishing together.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.711
Look, the sandwich.

03:31.712 --> 03:36.424
Two things I can smell inside 100 feet:
burning hamburger and a romance.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.634
You got a customer.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.177
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

03:40.178 --> 03:43.607
- Nothing else?
- Cream.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.225
- Where you been this time?
- L.A.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.102
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.730
First she's got you, now
she's got you and Bailey.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.691
And the only thing I
seem to get is older.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.461
Thanks a lot, Marny.
I'll see you later.

03:59.364 --> 04:02.700
Hmm. I guess I must
have said something.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.253
You talked enough.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.747
Everything people ought to know
they just don't want to hear.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.707
That's the trouble with the world.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.877
Either that or you're on the
wrong side of the counter.

04:12.878 --> 04:16.338
- Tell me something.
- You don't look as though I could.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.759
That, uh, Bailey who burns you
up, he run the gas station?

04:19.760 --> 04:23.053
- Do you know him?
- I might have once.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.348
If he keeps mooning around
Jim's girl, nobody'll know him...

04:26.349 --> 04:28.809
and that'd be too bad.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.438
You, uh, see much of this Bailey?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.441
Yeah, every day from here.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.526
I often wondered what
happened to him...

04:37.527 --> 04:42.333
then one day I'm breezing through here,
and there's his name up on a sign.

04:42.532 --> 04:47.338
- It's a small world.
- Yeah, or a big sign.

05:03.178 --> 05:08.405
- They're just not feeding today.
- They will later. It's clouding up.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.061
They say the day you die,
your name is written on a cloud.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.230
- Who says?
- They.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.440
Never heard of them.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.693
Nothing in that one but rain.
Think we ought to go home?

05:19.694 --> 05:21.111
Yes.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.961
- Do you want to?
- No.

05:25.992 --> 05:30.037
Every time I look at the sky, I think
of all the places I've never been.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.808
Yes, and every time you look
up, they're all the same.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.837
- You've been a lot of places, haven't you?
- One too many.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.131
- Which did you like best?
- This one right here.

05:41.132 --> 05:45.094
- I bet you say that to all the places.
- You see that cove over there?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.137
I'd like to build a
house right there...

05:47.138 --> 05:50.738
marry you, live in it and
never go anywhere else.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.987
I wish you would.

06:00.485 --> 06:04.196
You were never married
before, were you?

06:04.197 --> 06:06.490
Not that I can remember.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.409
That's good.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.537
You'd be amazed the way
people talk about you.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.138
The mysterious Jeff Bailey.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.587
My mother tells me that I've only
known you for such a short time.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.266
And where'd you come from?
And what did you do?

06:24.342 --> 06:27.111
My father was...

06:37.731 --> 06:40.149
- We'd better go.
- Is something the matter?

06:40.150 --> 06:42.202
Maybe not.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.124
Here.

06:51.745 --> 06:55.140
You sure are a secret man.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.043
Thanks.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.962
Oh, a man just wants to see me.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.685
Oh.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.777
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

07:22.859 --> 07:27.613
- JOE: A long time.
- Hello, Joe. I wish it was nicer to see you.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.950
Everyone sure missed you, Jeff,
but not as much as I have.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.118
- How's that?
- Whit used to look at me...

07:33.119 --> 07:36.497
shake his head, and wish
I had brains like you.

07:36.498 --> 07:40.501
- What's the other reason?
- I had to find you.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.628
- I owe you something?
- Not me.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.505
Who?

07:44.506 --> 07:48.217
- How far can that kid read lips?
- I don't know. I'll ask him some time.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.219
This far?

07:50.220 --> 07:54.056
- You don't like to make mistakes, do you?
- They don't let me have many.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.610
All right, come on inside.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.776
- Funny racket to find you in, Jeff.
- Yeah, me and the kid laugh all the time.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.487
Heh. I guess that's
because it's respectable.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.532
That hash slinger across the
street says you are too.

08:11.533 --> 08:15.285
- How did you happen to find me, Joe?
- I was driving down the road one day...

08:15.286 --> 08:20.457
and who do I see pumping gasoline
but my old chum from the old times.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.793
Of course, there's a
different name on the sign.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.546
- So you just dropped in?
- Why not?

08:25.547 --> 08:28.674
Okay, then I'm glad to
see an old pal too.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.635
So I take you to dinner, buy you
drinks, it gets late chewing the fat...

08:32.636 --> 08:35.054
you hop in your car and
you're gone. Right?

08:35.056 --> 08:37.975
- Almost.
- What else?

08:37.976 --> 08:40.269
I'm still working
for that guy, Jeff.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.563
- Whit?
- He'd like to see you.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.274
- As much as you did?
- Heh.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.360
- Worse.
- I see.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.738
No one ever thought
more of you than Whit.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.197
Or more about me.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.784
Well, that could be too.

08:55.785 --> 09:00.247
- All right, what's he want, Joe?
- Maybe he's got something nice for you.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.999
- Try once more.
- Heh.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.586
Look, Whit never steered you
into anything bad, did he?

09:05.587 --> 09:09.339
Why, he never even squawked when you
blew the best thing he ever gave you.

09:09.340 --> 09:13.510
- Go on.
- The guy just wants to see you.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.596
Well, you put it that
way, what can I do?

09:15.597 --> 09:18.525
You know of any other
way to put it?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.979
- Say tomorrow morning?
- Where?

09:23.980 --> 09:29.787
Lake Tahoe. Turn right at Emerald Bay.
Big house on a hill. You won't miss it.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.956
You can't.

(CAR HORN HONKING)

09:53.510 --> 09:57.554
WOMAN: Ann? John, are you
letting her out like this?

09:57.555 --> 10:02.656
Are you gonna stand for it, with a
man who won't even come to the door?

10:04.187 --> 10:07.240
Don't worry about them.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.827
- Darling.
- It's no good, is it?

10:10.985 --> 10:15.364
- It doesn't matter. It's just that they...
- Oh, honey, I know how they feel.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.158
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm not.

10:18.159 --> 10:22.287
- Then don't look so grim.
- No, it's something else.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.541
- What?
- That guy that showed up today...

10:25.542 --> 10:27.668
Yes?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.753
You want to ride with
me up to Lake Tahoe?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.964
- Now?
- Yes, now.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.549
I want to tell you something.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.676
All right, Jeff.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.637
You told me once I'd have
to tell you sometime.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.691
Well, this is it.

10:56.865 --> 11:01.785
Now, the first thing I wanna get off my
chest: My name isn't Bailey, it's Markham.

11:01.786 --> 11:06.415
- Markham. Jeff Markham?
- I should have told you before.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.043
I meant to, but I kept
putting it off...

11:10.044 --> 11:12.838
because I didn't
like any part of it.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.133
- Please tell me, Jeff.
- Some of it's gonna hurt you.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.552
It doesn't matter.

11:18.553 --> 11:22.181
Well, our friend Markham
lived in New York.

11:22.182 --> 11:26.894
He worked with a sort of stupid,
oily gent by the name of Jack Fisher.

11:26.895 --> 11:30.314
We called ourselves detectives.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.942
That was about three
years ago, maybe more.

11:33.943 --> 11:38.655
Wintertime. One of the coldest
days I remember in the town.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.991
And we got a call to
come and see a big op.

11:40.992 --> 11:44.786
- A what?
- An operator, gambler.

11:44.787 --> 11:48.707
He didn't come to see us because he
was too high-powered a character.

11:48.708 --> 11:53.170
Also, because some dame had taken
four shots at him with his own .38.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.769
Made one of them good.

11:59.594 --> 12:03.180
He was taking it in stride, but he
had a friend who was a ball of fire.

12:03.181 --> 12:07.267
Newspaper guys, wise guys, who
do they think they're kidding?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.686
So he shot himself
cleaning a cap pistol.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.106
So I shot the ace of spades out
of a sleeve during a gin game.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.108
A guy can't even get
shot by a dame...

12:15.109 --> 12:18.237
without the whole town
starting to buzz like a...

12:18.238 --> 12:22.463
Like you? Smoke a cigarette, Joe.

12:23.534 --> 12:29.164
You just sit and stay inside yourself.
You wait for me to talk. I like that.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.208
I never found out much
listening to myself.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.307
(WHIT CHUCKLES)

12:33.836 --> 12:35.638
Hmm.

12:36.339 --> 12:40.259
- It amazes me how she missed so often.
- FISHER: Maybe you were moving.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.109
A dame with a rod is like a
guy with a knitting needle.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.991
- What's he doing here? I called you.
- My partner.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.021
- Should I ask why you didn't call the law?
- Should you?

12:53.022 --> 12:56.149
Heh. I guess not.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.652
- Anything happen to her?
- She ran out on me.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.196
- With 40,000 bucks.
- I want her back.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.823
Or the money?

13:02.824 --> 13:05.200
(WHIT CHUCKLING)

13:05.201 --> 13:09.788
You know, I once bet $40,000 on a horse
that ran dead last, so I bought the horse.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.707
Yeah, that's what I mean.

13:11.708 --> 13:16.295
Oh, you're wrong. I put that
horse in a nice green pasture...

13:16.296 --> 13:19.089
so he'd never get his foot
caught in a mutuel machine.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.643
You should go out and
visit it sometime.

13:23.177 --> 13:28.682
No, I just want her back. When you
see her, you'll understand better.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.281
Maybe she's just an impulsive girl.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.326
- Shall we let it go at that?
- I can let it all go.

13:38.026 --> 13:42.957
An even 5000 now and 5
when you bring her back.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.157
And expenses.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.035
Now, that should have been
the first thing you said.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.705
- Find her, Jeff. Bring her back.
- JEFF: Why me?

13:51.706 --> 13:58.059
Well, I know a lot of smart guys and
a few honest ones, and you're both.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.009
What happens to her?

14:04.010 --> 14:05.778
I won't touch her.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.784
Okay.

14:14.062 --> 14:17.522
Get me the stuff on her family,
pictures, anything interesting.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.608
- You'll get it.
- I'll see you.

14:19.609 --> 14:23.288
You bring it over, Joe.
Come on, let's go.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.293
Oh, by the way, you mind
telling me her name?

14:29.619 --> 14:34.140
- Kathie Moffat.
- Thanks.

14:35.917 --> 14:41.380
She must be quite a dame.
A wild goose with 40 G's.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.841
You know, for a smart guy, that
Sterling sure trusts you, don't he?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.343
JEFF: Why not?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.345
- Am I going along?
- No.

14:48.346 --> 14:52.682
Oh, he doesn't like my personality, huh?
Well, I'm still in, Jeff, fifty-fifty.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.894
- Did I say anything different?
- All right. It's a good soft touch.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.825
Don't get hot at me. And
don't get any cute ideas.

(BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC)

15:18.376 --> 15:20.001
These are on me.

15:20.002 --> 15:24.172
This is an old friend of mine, Jeff Markham.
He wants to ask you something.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.884
- Which one of you is Eunice Leonard?
- Me.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.938
May I ask you a few questions?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.944
Come on, honey, let's dance.

15:39.355 --> 15:42.274
JEFF:
You work for Katherine Moffat?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.193
Not anymore, she's gone.
She got pushed around.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.447
I wouldn't have stayed myself,
only she got sick being vaccinated.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.074
- How come you're asking?
- I want to find her.

15:51.075 --> 15:55.078
- You want to find her for that man?
- No, for myself. Where'd she go?

15:55.079 --> 15:58.874
- Maybe I oughtn't to tell nothing.
- More harm might come to her if you didn't.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.669
- Is she in harm now?
- I don't know, she disappeared.

16:02.670 --> 16:06.339
- Maybe you better say, honey.
- Well, I can't say much.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.009
It wasn't no cold place though.
That girl hated snow.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.387

- No trunk?
- She only took suitcases.

- You're sure again?
- I know, I weighed them for her.

of excess baggage to Mexico City.

She had been at the
Reforma and then gone.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.006
I took the bus south like she did.

yourself, "How hot can it get?"

16:54.680 --> 16:56.139

16:56.140 --> 16:59.226
because if you wanna go south,
here's where you get the boat.

La Mar Azul next to a movie house.

with a beer and the darkness...

17:14.032 --> 17:18.328
only that music from the movie
next door kept jarring me awake.

17:18.329 --> 17:22.165
And then I saw her
coming out of the sun...

17:22.165 --> 17:25.835

care about that 40 grand.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.726
- And squeaky shoes.
- Think of a number, Joe.

31:35.727 --> 31:40.106
- Where were you off to?
- The telegraph office to wire you.

31:40.107 --> 31:43.581
I told you, I don't like
to spend your money.

31:44.194 --> 31:48.419
- I can stand it.
- Well, it's your business.

31:48.740 --> 31:52.785
Whit, my friend, there's a million dames
in this world, and they all look like her.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.509
No, they don't.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.541
So she was here.

31:58.542 --> 32:02.002
Well, according to all
available evidence, she was.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.630
Maybe I should've sent Stephanos.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.883
- Could you find one dame in a million, Joe?
- A one with 40 grand.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.231
(WHIT CHUCKLES)

32:14.558 --> 32:16.142
Sorry.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.518
You picked up some nerves.

32:17.519 --> 32:20.604
I don't need a crack like that
any more than I need your dough.

32:20.605 --> 32:25.818
That's what I've been telling you. I missed
her. The dame caught a boat south.

32:25.819 --> 32:29.113
- Where?
- Look, I got along before this job.

32:29.114 --> 32:33.284
I ate good, and I grew as big as you did.
If there's something you don't like, say so.

32:33.285 --> 32:37.621
- I just asked where.
- Chile. Guatemala.

32:37.622 --> 32:41.625
You wanna go see the guy in the steamship
company? You wanna talk to him right now?

32:41.626 --> 32:43.928
Why not?

32:53.972 --> 32:56.240
- Taxi, sir?
- Yeah.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.977
I'm sorry. You missed
her and you feel bad.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.780
I shouldn't have joked about it.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.522
All right, then I won't either.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.026
You get your 5 grand back and
Stephanos can take over from here.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.777
WHIT: You're wrong.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.697
I fire people, but nobody quits me.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.376
You started this and you'll end it.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.995
Besides, Joe couldn't find
a prayer in the Bible.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.414
You'll find her. Take it easy.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.792
Take your time. Well, better
get back to the airport.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.336
Good luck, Jeff.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.264
See you someday.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.847
JEFF: It wasn't all a lie
because she did take a steamer.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.600
It was just that it went
north instead of south.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.949
And I was on it too.

33:42.395 --> 33:45.448
I opened an office
in San Francisco.

33:46.107 --> 33:49.151
A cheap little rat hole
that suited the work I did.

33:49.152 --> 33:52.196
Shabby jobs for who'd ever hire me.

33:52.197 --> 33:57.048
It was the bottom of the barrel,
and I scraped it, but I didn't care.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.512
I had her.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.331
JEFF:
We kept pretty much to ourselves.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.959
We found a little movie
house in North Beach.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.629
We were on the run. We went to places
we never would've seen in our lives.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.507
And after a while, we grew a
little more sure of ourselves.

34:11.507 --> 34:16.094
We drifted back to more familiar
places, ballparks and the racetracks.

34:16.096 --> 34:21.402
Why not? After all, there wasn't one chance
in a million we'd bump into our past.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.826
One chance in a million.

34:26.565 --> 34:30.693
One chance in a million was all that chump
ever had in his life, and he made it good.

34:30.694 --> 34:34.362
He stood there with our lives in his
pocket, because I knew if he saw her...

34:34.364 --> 34:37.417
he'd sell us both for $1.95.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.965
So we had to separate.

34:41.371 --> 34:45.081
I went alone to L.A., and I made
it easy for him to follow me.

34:45.083 --> 34:49.103
He was a good gumshoe. It was the
one thing he could really do.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.880
So I went everywhere like a
guy enjoying the country.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.717
I didn't write to her
or phone or telegraph.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.927
I just waited and moved.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.347
When it seemed right, I blew out
of town to go and meet her.

35:00.348 --> 35:04.824
I wasn't bad at the game myself. I was sure
I had shaken him loose, and I felt good.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.997
Fisher was back there somewhere,
and I could see her again.

35:15.488 --> 35:19.491
We'd arranged to meet at a little cabin
off the highway on Pyramid Creek.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.869
It was dark when I
was getting there.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.923
And then I saw her walking up
the road in the headlights.

35:31.004 --> 35:34.934
- JEFF: You want a lift, babe?
- Well, I really hadn't ought.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.428
JEFF: You're a cute little package
to be out walking alone at night.

35:39.429 --> 35:42.306
You're kind of cute yourself
to be walking alone any night.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.984
That does it.

35:48.938 --> 35:52.232
JEFF: It was meeting her
somewhere, like in the first times.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.943
There was still that something
about her that got me.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.417
A kind of magic or whatever it was.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.756
Well, I held her, and we could laugh
because we were together again.

36:01.785 --> 36:05.134
We'd played it smart
and forgotten nothing.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.873
Forgotten nothing except one thing.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.551
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

36:18.134 --> 36:19.885
JEFF: He had followed her.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.483
Hello, Jeff.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.162
Don't I get introduced?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.955
I don't blame you, Jeff.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.957
Maybe I'd have lied my head
off just like you did.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.302
Your picture don't do
you justice, baby.

36:44.911 --> 36:48.414
- Why don't you break his head, Jeff?
- Cute.

36:48.415 --> 36:51.917
Whit should've got her back. As I
understand, they deserve each other.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.546
- You working for him now?
- Who else would he get to find my partner?

36:55.547 --> 36:58.020
All right, Fisher,
what's the pitch?

36:58.174 --> 37:00.884
You and I had a little deal, Jeff.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.304
Ten grand and expenses,
fifty-fifty.

37:04.305 --> 37:07.808
Remember? You used to have a good
memory. Whatever happened to it?

37:07.809 --> 37:10.227
- I didn't collect.
- Not the 10 grand.

37:10.228 --> 37:14.356
I can give you a tip. You tell Whit where
we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.954
KATHIE: Jeff.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.068
He isn't going to
tell Whit anything.

37:18.069 --> 37:22.656
Sure not. You just come up with that
40 grand, and we're all pals again.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.493
- I might even cut you in for a piece of it.
- There isn't any 40 grand.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.495
Of course Whit's broad-minded.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.914
He don't care about a few
slugs in the stomach...

37:30.915 --> 37:33.217
or the 40 grand the
dame went off with...

37:33.376 --> 37:36.225
or even Jeff pretending
he fell down on the job.

37:36.588 --> 37:40.924
But you and Jeff ganging up
together, he might not like that.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.273
Tell him, Kathie.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.596
Sure, I shot him.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.570
I'm not sorry about that.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.571
But I didn't take his money.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.936
- Beat it.
- FISHER: Look at all the angles.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.689
You know Whit and you know
how far he can reach.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.401
So just pay me off and
I'm quiet, but use cash.

to you by this cheap piece of baggage.

- Yes, I did.

You wouldn't have killed him. You would've

- You didn't have to do it.
- You wouldn't have killed him.

it wasn't a nice story.

had happened was done.

Yeah, but you should've
known about it long ago.

to see you again.

Ah. Same guy. Time-proof,
weatherproof.

- Cigarette?
- Smoking.

- Thanks. Had breakfast?
- No.

Say, I understand you're operating
a little gasoline station.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.543
- You say it like it's hard to understand.
- Well, it is.

41:44.544 --> 41:48.088
It's very simple. I sell gasoline.
I make a small profit.

41:48.089 --> 41:51.008
With that I buy groceries,
the grocer makes a profit.

41:51.009 --> 41:54.594
They call it earning a living.
You may have heard of it somewhere.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.889
I may have, but it wasn't from you.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.684
- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Whit.
- My feelings?

42:00.685 --> 42:04.354
Ten years ago, I hid them somewhere
and I haven't been able to find them.

Nice, isn't it?

42:10.862 --> 42:13.836
Yeah, it must have set
you back a few shells.

Not exactly.

I need your help.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.708
Like old times.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.137
I always liked you.

42:27.336 --> 42:31.006
You liked me because you could use me.
You could use me because I was smart.

42:31.007 --> 42:33.216
I'm not smart anymore.
I run a gas station.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.010

Can you still listen?

42:36.888 --> 42:38.638
I can hear.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.599
Well, you told me
about your business.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.603
Well, mine is a little more precarious,
and I earn considerably more.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.021
So I've heard.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.856
So has the government.

42:47.857 --> 42:50.942
Well, this may sound ridiculous,
but you could pay them.

42:50.943 --> 42:54.029
- That would be against my nature.
- All right, forget I said it.

42:54.030 --> 42:58.617
So I collaborated with a certain
man who understands these things.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.994
He saved me quite a bit
of money, $1 million.

43:00.995 --> 43:05.624
I didn't particularly trust him, so
I paid him well, but he's unhappy.

43:05.625 --> 43:08.543
- He wants more money.
- Well, he saved you a lot.

43:08.544 --> 43:12.422
Oh, I appreciate it. I always
remember what any man did for me.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.840
Or didn't.

43:13.841 --> 43:17.969
Perhaps. The point is that
now he wants 200,000.

43:17.970 --> 43:21.932
Or he could get 10 percent of the million
from the government, if he turns you in.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.892
You're up on these things.

43:23.893 --> 43:27.729
- Has he got anything to trade?
- Well, he has the income tax records.

43:27.730 --> 43:31.900
But I don't see why I should buy them
when I might persuade you to get them.

43:31.901 --> 43:33.777
- Then I'd have them.
- I know.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.403
But I can trust you.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.948
You know, I don't think
you can trust anybody.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.450
You better go in there
and get them yourself.

43:40.451 --> 43:43.078
- I'd rather you did it.
- I pass.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.496
You don't like it?

43:44.497 --> 43:47.207
No, I just can't get
away from my business.

- You're back in the fold too, Jeff.
- I see what you mean.

You see, Jeff, you
owe me something.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.633
You'll never be happy until
you square yourself.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.669

heart to him, Kathie?

44:24.120 --> 44:25.888
I couldn't help it, Jeff.

44:27.331 --> 44:30.250
- Well, that settles things.
- Does it?

but, uh, you won't
go to him directly.

44:36.799 --> 44:39.342

he's rather fond of.

She may even find you charming.

I understand that women have.

She'll tell you how it's lined up.

Francisco, don't you?

44:54.025 --> 44:56.443
Yeah, I was there once at a party.

- Like the monkey and the weasel.

We'll put you on a
train this afternoon.

- Right now, I'd like to get some sleep.
- WHIT: Find Joe. He'll show you to your room.

45:38.945 --> 45:41.196
You can never help
anything, can you?

45:41.197 --> 45:45.627
You're like a leaf that the wind
blows from one gutter to another.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.079
You can't help anything
you do, even murder.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.332
- You can't say it was that.
- I can say one thing. I buried him.

45:52.333 --> 45:55.762
- What did you tell him? About us?
- Uh...

45:57.838 --> 46:01.800
- But you couldn't help it, could you?
- He looked right into me and he knew it.

46:01.801 --> 46:03.843
- How much?
- What, Jeff?

46:03.844 --> 46:06.263
About Fisher. Did he look
into you for that too?

46:06.264 --> 46:08.441
No, I didn't tell that.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.142
- Don't lie to me.
- I didn't.

46:11.143 --> 46:14.187
I wouldn't tell him that.
I wouldn't tell anyone that.

46:14.188 --> 46:16.439
I swear it, Jeff. Believe me.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.608
Sure. Sure, I believe you.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.610
I didn't know what to do.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.446
I was always afraid of him
and afraid of what I'd done.

46:23.447 --> 46:26.533
I couldn't live that way
anymore. I couldn't stand it.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.618
Oh, Jeff, I've missed you.

46:28.619 --> 46:32.122
I've wondered about you and
prayed you'd understand.

46:32.123 --> 46:33.540
Can you understand?

46:33.541 --> 46:35.343
You prayed, Kathie?

46:35.376 --> 46:37.644
Can't you even feel sorry for me?

46:37.670 --> 46:40.171
- I'm not going to try.
- Jeff...

46:40.172 --> 46:43.521
Look, just get out, will you?
I have to sleep in this room.

46:46.345 --> 46:49.865
Let's just leave it where
it all is. Get out.

- Yes.

47:38.731 --> 47:41.784
- My name is Bailey.
- Come in.

47:44.612 --> 47:47.864
- I was expecting you.
- Well, I wasn't expecting you.

47:47.865 --> 47:51.201
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Whit told me you'd be charming.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.578
Really? Would you
like a gin and tonic?

47:53.579 --> 47:56.122
- That'd be nice.
- You may have whiskey, if you like.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.425
That'd be even nicer.

48:01.754 --> 48:04.728
Miserable weather
we're having, isn't it?

48:05.383 --> 48:09.688
- Are you acquainted with San Francisco?
- We were quite intimate.

48:09.804 --> 48:12.680
- Indeed?
- We lived together.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.516
It's a nice apartment
you have here.

48:14.517 --> 48:18.061
Yes, these old houses can be amusing
when they're remodeled, can't they?

48:18.062 --> 48:20.688
I used to live in one in
New York that was old.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.357
It wasn't very amusing.

48:22.358 --> 48:26.027
- I've never been to New York.
- You take a trip there sometime.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.947
You'll see one reason why
I'm in San Francisco.

48:28.948 --> 48:30.698
Whit said you'd tell me the other.

48:30.699 --> 48:34.911
You know, you're rather charming yourself,
but I'm afraid I don't quite understand you.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.038
If you'll drop this
Junior League patter...

48:37.039 --> 48:39.762
we may get the conversation
down where it belongs.

48:40.084 --> 48:43.336
- You worried about something?
- I don't know. Should I be?

48:43.337 --> 48:47.507
- Not if you do what you're told.
- That's why I'm here. I do what I'm told.

48:47.508 --> 48:51.553
People trust me. Whit even
trusts me twice. Do you?

48:51.554 --> 48:54.152
Just as far as I have to.

48:54.515 --> 48:57.851
Can you find your way
to 114 Fulton Street?

48:57.852 --> 48:59.853
- When?
- Tonight.

48:59.854 --> 49:03.356
I'll be there in the apartment of
an attorney named Leonard Eels.

49:03.357 --> 49:06.025
You can call for me
at 8 and look around.

49:06.026 --> 49:09.362
I can depend on that.
We'll leave together.

49:09.363 --> 49:11.865
In a day or so, he'll
take some papers home.

49:11.866 --> 49:13.366
I'll let you know.

49:13.367 --> 49:15.702
Then you get them.
He won't be there.

49:15.703 --> 49:17.203
Where will he be?

49:17.204 --> 49:20.665
With me. I'm his secretary.

49:20.666 --> 49:24.085
- Well, it sounds simple enough.
- It is.

49:24.086 --> 49:27.356
- Like two and two make four.
- That's right.

49:31.385 --> 49:35.280
Just remember, I'm coming out of
this in one piece, Miss Carson.

49:35.473 --> 49:39.058
Do you always go around leaving your
fingerprints on a girl's shoulder?

49:39.059 --> 49:44.115
Not that I mind particularly.
You've got nice strong hands.

49:59.914 --> 50:01.706
- Jeff.
- Petey, how are you?

50:01.707 --> 50:03.750
Where you been? You
marry an honest dame?

50:03.751 --> 50:07.420
- I went in the gasoline business.
- But you're looking for me now, ain't you?

50:07.421 --> 50:10.975
I went out of business. Come on,
let's take a ride in your hack.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.096
Buddy, you look like
you're in trouble.

50:17.097 --> 50:20.276
- Why?
- Because you don't act like it.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.071
I think I'm in a frame.

50:23.312 --> 50:25.188
Don't sound like you.

50:25.189 --> 50:27.732
I don't know. All I
can see is the frame.

I'm going in there now
to look at the picture.

50:30.069 --> 50:33.873

- You don't have to tell me nothing.

pick her up. I'm Leonard Eels.

- META: Bring him out here, Leonard.

51:16.699 --> 51:18.616

- Thanks.

the ninth wonder of the world.

Don't then. Why don't you
both stay and have dinner?

51:43.100 --> 51:44.517
Yes, why don't we?

51:44.518 --> 51:47.604
We can't, Jeffrey. We promised
the Bigelows, remember?

51:47.605 --> 51:49.897
JEFF: Oh, call them up.
We can see them anytime.

51:49.898 --> 51:52.066
We can't, Jeffrey.
I'm sorry, Leonard.

51:52.067 --> 51:55.120
Some other time. How long will
you be in town, Mr. Bailey?

51:55.529 --> 51:58.448
- I don't really know.
- LEONARD: You're on business?

51:58.449 --> 52:01.753
- You might call it that.
- Where are you from? The South?

52:02.286 --> 52:06.414
- No. Tahoe.
- We must go, Jeff.

52:06.415 --> 52:08.388
JEFF: All right.

52:11.253 --> 52:14.339
Your, uh, cousin is a
very charming young lady.

52:14.340 --> 52:18.611
No, he isn't. His name is Norman and
he's a bookmaker in Cleveland, Ohio.

52:20.929 --> 52:23.556
- Where did you say you were from?
- Tahoe...

the income tax as anybody.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.063

52:30.064 --> 52:32.440

52:32.441 --> 52:34.859
or my being brought up here...

52:34.860 --> 52:36.986
to, uh, leave my
fingerprints around.

52:36.987 --> 52:39.030
On the other hand, maybe it does.

52:39.031 --> 52:42.200
You know, it could be that I'm the
patsy, and you're on the spot.

52:42.201 --> 52:44.869

- Right away.

52:44.870 --> 52:47.969
Keep the martinis
dry, I'll be back.

52:53.003 --> 52:55.463
I'm glad you could
come, both of you.

52:55.464 --> 52:57.882
- Mr. Eels, you make a great martini.
- Thank you.

52:57.883 --> 52:59.300
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.979
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

That's one way to be
clever: Look like an idiot.

He looked like an underweight
ghost. What did you say to him?

53:19.196 --> 53:21.197
I told him he made a great martini.

53:21.198 --> 53:23.408
- You are an idiot.
- So is he.

53:23.409 --> 53:27.134

- Why not? He's in love with you.

Maybe he isn't such a nice guy.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.489
Maybe he crosses people too.

53:53.355 --> 53:56.232
- Do I go alone?
- No, you go back to your hotel and wait.

53:56.233 --> 53:58.456

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.363
Then we've got them, Jeff. We can
get anything we want from them.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.240
I'd like that affidavit you signed.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.993
We can get it. It's
in Eels' office safe.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:12.538
We can make Meta get it.
We can make them do anything.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:14.248
Sure.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:15.708
Oh, Jeff...

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:18.127
You ought to have killed
me for what I did.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:21.297
- There's time.
- No. You won't.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.382
I've never stopped loving you.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.593
I was afraid and no good,
but I never stopped...

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:28.721
even if you hated me.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.139
Did you?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.785
- Yes.
- But you don't now.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.163
No.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.523
We can be together again.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:42.985
In a way we never were.
We can go back to Acapulco...

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.030
and start all over as though
nothing had happened.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.004
Yes.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.040
How do we get the briefcase?

Whit owns a club.

01:03:57.709 --> 01:03:59.793
The Sterling Club on North Beach.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:03.172
Meta took it there to
a man named Baylord.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.007
I might get by with it.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.675
You will, darling.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.534
What happened to you?

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.287
I went to a bar and bought a
double. I must be slipping.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.247
I guess you must be.

hard he couldn't even pray.

I never saw anyone
so afraid to die.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.984
- I didn't like it.
- You killed him?

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.025
Certainly.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:55.450
But I called. A man went up and looked
in the apartment and he wasn't there.

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:59.228
- Eels?
- Yes, Eels. He wasn't there.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:02.373
I was there. And the way I
left him, he didn't walk away.

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.369
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.957

- Just so that briefcase comes with him.
- Right.

- All arranged, sir.
- Twenty for you, the rest for transportation.

the airport with the ticket.

- Thank you, sir.
- You know, a bad memory is like an ill wind.

- It can blow somebody luck.
- I always say everybody's right.

- All right, wise guy.
- I wouldn't.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.696
I told you. I'm tired of
getting pushed around.

of breath. Won't he, Joe?

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.408
Cut it, Lou.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.703
Your move now is to do a little
thinking. A little talking.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.999
See, I've got the files that
were in your briefcase.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.585
I also know the address of
the Treasury Department.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:55.087
That's the theory, isn't it? Keep the
files away from the treasury boys.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.506

years in a federal pen.

- We may do that.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:05.140
Sure. Of course, the government may
just pat Whit on the back and say:

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.144
"Go on home. We got all the dough we need.
We'll never miss your million dollars."

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.604
You wanna lay a price on that?

How did you know I
had the briefcase?

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.361
JEFF: I had Meta tailed.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:20.322
You sure about that?

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:23.908
Look, I don't have to be sure
about anything except the files.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:27.430
Now, do you wanna talk business,
or do you wanna play house?

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.165
What's your idea?

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.335
You get the files, and you
also get Eels' body...

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.796
in case you wanna keep
it from the cops.

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.939
What do you want?

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:42.612
I want the affidavit that Meta put in
Eels' safe when she took the files out.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:47.491
A lie that somebody put on paper that
I killed a guy named Jack Fisher.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.777
Because, you see,
I only buried him.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.654
And you don't get the gas
for being the undertaker.

affidavit outside of Whit.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.077

- Did Meta tell you?
- No.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.589
Sorry.

- Put in a call for Whit Sterling...
- No, sit down.

- We better keep Whit out of this.
- He's right, Kathie.

Oh, you've hurt her feelings, Lou.
I can tell you, she's a sensitive girl.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.885
- I'm kind of sensitive myself.
- And you won't need Whit.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:27.347
All you'll need is Meta to unlock
that safe in Eels' office.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:30.225
- I hope Meta's still around.
- She's around.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.853
Good. Then you can start right now.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:36.982
I'll call you in about an hour. That'll
give you time to find her and get there.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:40.402
Give you a little extra time to
figure out how you're gonna cross me.

told the kid he was fishing.

I'll bet he's pacing up and
down, worrying about Joe.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:42.318
- You think I sent Joe?
- Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:46.406
- All right. Where is the gentleman?
- Downstairs. In the library, I think.

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:49.284
Jeff, don't let him trick you.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.911
He'll pay anything you ask.
He'll do anything you ask.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.886
Sure he will. Anything.

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.297
If only there was some
way about Fisher.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.396
There is.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.237
(FOOTSTEPS)

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:19.564
Well, you getting things in
shape for the treasury boys?

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:23.460
Hello, Jeff. I've been
sort of expecting you.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:27.363
Well, let's get down to business.
Start all over again, right?

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:31.117
- You have some papers of mine.
- All right, you take the frame off me.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:33.637
You pin the Eels murder on Joe.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:37.599
Sure. Sure.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:40.668
I get a modest settlement. Say...

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.670
Oh, say 50,000.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:46.396
That should be enough for me to
spend my waning years in Mazatlán.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.844
Not Acapulco because I'd keep
thinking about you, Kathie.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.847
Up there in the women's
prison in Tehachapi.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:56.243
It won't be too bad. Hills all
around you, plenty of sun.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.645
You make me nervous.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:04.067
You'll be happier if you let the cops
have her. That's what you'll have to do.

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:08.196
Somebody's gotta take the rap for
Fisher's murder. It's not gonna be me.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:10.198
Wait a minute.

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.719
- I'm not framing any woman.
- JEFF: When did you reform?

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.718
I wouldn't try it, Whit.
You're out of shape.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:20.375
- Besides, it's not a frame. She shot him.
- He was gonna kill you.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:24.462
See, Whit? Self-defense. A cinch to beat.
She might not even have to do time.

01:21:24.463 --> 01:21:28.609
- I'll say you killed him. They'll believe me.
- Do you believe her?

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.817
Go on, Kathie, tell him about Joe.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.014
What about Joe? Where is he?

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:37.934
Last time I saw him, he was
in the East Walker River.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:41.660
I didn't send him after Jeff.
It was his own idea.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:46.943
- Did you kill him?
- He slipped and fell.

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:50.696
When I got there, it was too
late. That's a mean river.

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:52.115
WHIT: He was trailing you?

01:21:52.116 --> 01:21:54.700
Well, you don't go fishing
with a .45 in your hand.

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:57.453
But stop worrying about it.
It makes everything simple.

01:21:57.454 --> 01:22:01.374
A dead man? Fish him out. Stick
a note in his pocket. Suicide.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:04.627
He couldn't stand living
with what he had done.

01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:08.148
Don't look so stricken, Whit.
You'll get over it. I did.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.773
But you talk it out if you want
to. I'll be waiting in there.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.678
Oh, one thing, Kathie:

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:17.014
Did it take much persuasion to
make you say I killed Fisher?

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:21.227
Come on. Feed my ego.
Tell me he beat you.

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:24.577
Tell me he had to drag
every word out of you.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:28.818
- Well, that's the way it is.
- You said you were going.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:30.871
Get out.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:50.131
You dirty little phony.
Go on, lie some more.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.842
Tell me how you handled things
for me in San Francisco.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:55.052
Tell me it was all Joe's
idea. Go on, Kathie.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:57.847
Show me how you're gonna
squirm your way out this time.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:23:00.850
- Listen...
- What a sucker you must think I am.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:04.520
I took you back when you came
whimpering and crawling.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:07.440
I should have kicked your teeth in.

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:10.693
No, I'm not going to.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:14.947
Not now, Kathie. We'll let
the law push you around.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:16.866
- You can't.
- You're wrong.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:19.076
You're gonna take the
rap and play along.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.996
You're gonna make every
exact move I tell you.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.499
If you don't, I'll kill you.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.335
And I'll promise you one
thing: It won't be quick.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.420
I'll break you first.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:33.466
You won't be able to answer a phone or
open a door without thinking, "This is it."

01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:37.303
And when it comes,
it still won't be quick.

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.527
And it won't be pretty.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:43.527
You can take your choice.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:45.863
KATHIE: Whit.

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:08.334
I have to go to Reno for
your money. Where's the file?

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.933
JEFF: It'll be mailed to you.

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:14.353
I crossed you once. I know better
than to try it a second time.

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:18.010
I've got a reason for
wanting to be let alone.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.814
You'll get the file,
after I'm out of reach.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.934
Well, if that's the
way it has to be.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:28.187
While you're in Reno, find a pilot
who can keep his mouth shut.

01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:31.691
Tell him to set his plane down in
the desert where he won't be seen.

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.734
Make it about dawn.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:36.696
And cheer up, Kathie.
You'll get out of it all right.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:39.170
You always have.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.458
- They say you killed a man.
- Do you believe them?

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:34.503
- Not until you tell me.
- You believe everything I say, don't you?

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:37.506
Everything you say
to me, I believe.

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:40.310
I don't know why I do this.

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:43.804
I don't know why I let you come
back into my life. Why I don't...

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:47.183
slap your face and send
you home. I don't know.

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:50.436
- Because you said you'd come back.
- But not like this.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:53.707
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:56.914
You know, I had to come back.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:05.010
- Take me with you, Jeff.
- I have to play this alone.

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:09.622
- You've seen her again?
- Yeah, I saw her.

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:13.268
- Was it the same?
- I saw her, and it was nothing.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:17.171
She can't be all bad. No one is.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.840
Well, she comes the closest.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.843
- Are you going to see her again?
- Tonight, for the last time.

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:25.930
Then look at her.
And look at yourself.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:31.237
And be very sure that there isn't
even a little bit of love left for her.

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:36.691
Then when you find out and you
know it once and forever...

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:38.693
send for me.

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:42.498
I don't have to find out.
I know it now.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:48.119
- That's all I wanted to hear.
- You know, maybe I was wrong...

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.580
and luck is like love. You have
to go all the way to find it.

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:53.666
You do to keep it.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:56.627
You better go. Did the
kid do what I told him?

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:59.672
They're following him south,
the state police and all of them.

01:26:59.673 --> 01:27:01.225
Good.

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:04.770
I can't go.

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:27.626
- You can put that away.
- JEFF: I can't think of a better place to put it.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:32.538
- I just want to tell you something.
- Tell it.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:34.307
I was going to kill you.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.219
- Who isn't?
- Or tell the cops where you were.

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.181
I followed Ann tonight.

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:45.968
- What stopped you?
- Some things you said to her.

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:49.764
- You said were gonna tell me something.
- I grew up with her.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:52.558
I've loved her ever since
I fixed her roller skates.

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:55.853
I don't know whether I'm good enough
for her, but I know you aren't.

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:59.106
That's one difference. The
other is that she loves me.

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:02.693
You told her you didn't know why you
let her back into your dirty life.

01:28:02.694 --> 01:28:06.197
I don't know what got you where you
are or where it's gonna take you.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:08.671
She's not going with it.

01:28:09.993 --> 01:28:11.869
Why don't you say it to the law.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:15.390
Then all the rest of your life
you can tell her how you did it.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.394
KATHIE: You can't make deals
with a dead man, Jeff.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.105
No, you can't.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.309
- Let's get out of here.
- There's someplace left to go?

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:20.955
- I think so.
- You're running the show now?

01:29:24.484 --> 01:29:26.752
Do you mind, Jeff?

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:33.534
Remember the mountains? Higher than
these and always snow on them.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:37.663
- We should have stayed there.
- I'm trying to remember something else.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:40.207
I never told you I was
anything but what I am.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.501
You just wanted to imagine I was.

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:46.005
That's why I left you.
Now we're back to stay.

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:49.884
- And I have nothing to say about it?
- Well, have you?

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:53.721
Whit's dead. A bundle of
papers isn't any good.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:57.182
If Joe was around, you could
use him, but Joe's dead too.

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.643
So, what are you gonna do
about Eels and Fisher?

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:02.187
For that matter, what are
you gonna do about this?

01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:04.398
Someone has to take the blame.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:08.954
You have nothing on me, but I'd make
a fine witness for the prosecution.

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:13.834
Don't you see? You've only
me to make deals with now.

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:17.383
- Well, build my gallows high, baby.
- No.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:21.916
No, we're starting all over.
I wanna go back to Mexico.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:25.002
I wanna walk out of the sun
again and find you waiting.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:29.173
I wanna sit in the same moonlight and tell
you all the things I never told you...

01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:33.093
until you don't hate me.
Until sometime you love again.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:36.221
They'll always be looking for us.
They won't stop till we die.

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:39.822
I don't care. Just so
they find us together.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:44.980
If you're thinking of anyone
else, don't. It wouldn't work.

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:47.483
You're no good for anyone but me.

01:30:47.484 --> 01:30:49.661
You're no good and neither am I.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.880
That's why we deserve each other.

01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:00.454
Did he get the plane?

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:03.916
- Where is it?
- I'm running the show, don't forget.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:06.210
I doubt you'll ever let me.
Where's the money?

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:10.436
- Upstairs.
- Better pack a couple of bags and get it.

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:16.195
- Put a few things in for me.
- I have.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:07.187
Thanks.

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.489
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:12.460
Do you remember La Mar Azul?

01:32:12.902 --> 01:32:16.071
If I remember, you were a very
clumsy flirt, but I liked that.

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:18.466
We owe it all to José Rodriguez.

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:23.259
I wonder if he'll ever know
what a bad guide he really was.

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:27.750
Jeff, we've been wrong a
lot and unlucky a long time.

01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:30.600
I think we deserve a break.

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.881
We deserve each other.

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:35.183
(GLASS BREAKS)

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:08.349
KATHIE: Hurry, Jeff.

Dirty, double-crossing rat!

01:33:58.007 --> 01:33:59.934
(GUNSHOT)

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.904
Sorry.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:52.227
Too many people. Too much talk.

01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:54.563
Maybe that's why I like this town.

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:57.913
Here, three people
are really a crowd.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:02.571
Let's get in the car and
get away from them.

01:35:02.572 --> 01:35:05.616
I won't talk to you, Ann.
I just wanna be with you.

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:09.046
Thanks, Jim, but I can't.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.935
You can tell me. You knew
him better than I did.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:26.028
Was he going away with her?

01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:29.524
I have to know.
