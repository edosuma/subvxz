Turns out the party at Max
Rager tonight is a lock-in.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.249
Because of their new
Super Max drink.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.964
We're going to break
into Max Rager

Someday soon, Seattle's gonna be
the capital of the zombie homeland,

00:38.539 --> 00:40.371
and a lot of people aren't
gonna wanna see that happen.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.789
So are you with us

00:42.000 --> 00:43.161
or against us?

00:46.797 --> 00:48.789
Okay, we all have to get
our stories straight.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.296
Here's mine. Max Rager employees
were knocking back cans of Super Max

00:52.511 --> 00:54.377
and just lost their minds,
began attacking each other.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.010
Vaughn's armed guards started spraying
them down with bullets. Chaos ensued.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.591
We should go with something
close to the truth.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.926
Zombie outbreak?

01:01.144 --> 01:03.306
Major had information
about Chaos Killer victims

01:03.522 --> 01:04.933
locked in a secret
basement lab.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.605
We used the party as a cover
to check it out

01:06.775 --> 01:08.016
and we found the
Chaos Killer victims.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.521
You guys are the heroes here.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.398
Not sure that'll be
the takeaway.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.990
We're taking the survivors to the
medical facility on our campus.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.908
We'll debrief them, make sure
they're all on the same page

01:18.120 --> 01:19.782
before they have to talk to
the press or the authorities.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.488
You know, I hate to rain on
the parade here,

01:21.707 --> 01:23.994
but there's probably
100 dead bodies downstairs.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.826

Yep.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.387
What do you mean,
"Why me"?

02:19.598 --> 02:21.590
I mean, you're
a district attorney.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.889
And he's a stool pigeon.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.058
Why would Mr. Boss
think he could draw out

(SIGHS)

02:29.441 --> 02:31.603
Well... I guess...

02:31.818 --> 02:33.229
It may have gotten
back to Mr. Boss

02:33.445 --> 02:36.062
that I had developed,
um, feelings

02:36.657 --> 02:37.864
for Miss Charles.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.159
- And those feelings were...
- Unreciprocated.

(CLEARS THROAT)
"Unreciprocated," she said.

02:48.627 --> 02:49.788
You didn't get that down.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.289
Only because I can't spell it.

So, while this
gun battle is going on,

02:53.924 --> 02:55.836
you're sitting outside in
the car. Do I have that right?

02:56.968 --> 02:58.209
He was supposed to signal.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.464
S. CAVANAUGH: Yeah...

02:59.680 --> 03:01.091
Probably just as well.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.765
A Seattle PD employee shouldn't
get wrapped up in all of this.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.217
Talk about bad publicity.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.393
No, there can't be any
publicity on this.

Four dead bodies in the office of
Seattle's preeminent crime lord...

03:12.818 --> 03:15.777
Well, Mr. Deaux has given 100
hours of testimony against Mr. Boss.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.774
It's imperative we keep
his name out of this.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.105

Why would Mr. Boss think that
Blaine would show up to save Peyton?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.511
The important thing
is that Peyton's safe.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.635

was romantically involved with Blaine.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.849
- You and Blaine?
- Major. This is important.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.730
I propose that from
this day forward,

04:38.945 --> 04:41.232
no big secrets between
the five of us.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.064
From now on, we're all
on the same team,

04:43.283 --> 04:44.569
working in the same direction.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.822
I'm a zombie.
Major is a zombie.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.824
- Peyton's sleeping with Blaine.
- Slept with. Once.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.200
Is it too late to say
that I kind of liked

04:50.415 --> 04:51.872
being out of the loop
on some of this?

04:52.042 --> 04:55.956
It's in the spirit of this new honesty
that I want to tell you about a moment

04:56.171 --> 04:57.207
I shared with Vivian Stoll.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.708
Wait, who's Vivian?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.506
The private
military contractor lady.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.003
The one that
saved their asses.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.461
Right. And when I went back
down there,

05:04.679 --> 05:07.717
she and her mercenaries were
snacking on Rob Thomas' brain.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.014
They were zombies too?

05:09.226 --> 05:11.593
Yeah. And she knew
that I was one.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.054
Well, you don't do much
to hide it.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.638
She told that me that
Seattle was going to be

05:15.857 --> 05:17.849
the capital of
a zombie homeland.

05:18.151 --> 05:18.811
A zombie...

05:19.027 --> 05:20.893
People weren't going
to want to see that happen.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.775
Yeah, I could see a few
close-minded people objecting.

05:24.282 --> 05:28.367
She wanted to know if
I was with her or against her.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.365
With or against her how?
What does that even mean?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.287
Well, I think it means that
Fillmore-Graves wants to

05:32.499 --> 05:34.536
make Seattle a
zombie-friendly city.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.582
"Zombie-friendly"?

05:35.877 --> 05:38.085
Like, "Eat all the brains you
want, we'll make more"?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.628
I didn't get details.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.457
There was a bit of a rush to get out
of the building before they blew it up.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.258
I don't think I can
roll with this.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.212
I mean, what if in the history
of the Zombie Wars

05:48.306 --> 05:50.172
I'm the human who had
a chance to say something,

05:50.392 --> 05:51.382
and I sat on my hands?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.388
I mean, bright side,

05:53.603 --> 05:55.595
the writer of the history
of the Zombie Wars

05:55.814 --> 05:57.396
will very likely be a zombie,

05:57.607 --> 05:59.064
and you'll be viewed
as a hero.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.563
I'm not saying that
we should just roll with it.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.149
We should go visit
Vivian tomorrow.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.480
You, me, Major.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.281
We'll find out exactly
what she means

06:07.492 --> 06:09.199
about Seattle being
a zombie homeland.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.903
And then we can decide what we
want to do with that information.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.738
Fine.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.119
I'm in.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.255
Don E.?

06:24.467 --> 06:25.583
Where is it, Blaine?

06:26.136 --> 06:27.968
- Where's what?
- You know what, where's the money?

06:28.179 --> 06:30.341
- What money are you talking about?
- The Lucky U money!

06:31.391 --> 06:32.472
- Did someone shoot you...
- No, no.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.017
Don't play dumb with me
anymore, I know that it's a lie,

06:35.228 --> 06:36.639
this whole memory-loss thing.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.141
Honestly, Don E.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.313
Nothing has made
sense to me lately.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.766
You know when
I figured it out?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.648
- Figured what out?
- I'd just been shot.

06:44.863 --> 06:45.979
Several times.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.154
I mean, zombie or not,
bullets hurt.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.700
And I'm lying there, praying
that Mr. Boss' dimwit henchman

06:51.912 --> 06:53.073
doesn't shoot me in the head.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.701
And then suddenly it
all became clear.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.828
You made all this happen.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.124
All of what?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.043
Everything!

07:01.254 --> 07:02.415
I don't know when
you got the idea,

07:02.631 --> 07:05.374
but I'm guessing it's when you
took the cure, and it worked.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.958
And then you weren't
a zombie anymore,

07:07.177 --> 07:09.385
and then you realized,
"Wait, if there's a cure,"

07:09.596 --> 07:11.383
"then I don't have
a business anymore."

07:11.598 --> 07:15.638
And so then you thought, what's
a side effect no one would want?

07:17.228 --> 07:19.311
Total memory loss.
That's the ticket.

07:19.522 --> 07:23.687
But keeping your business
wasn't the only upside, was it?

07:23.902 --> 07:24.858
No.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.653
That smokin' district attorney
is never gonna fall in love

07:27.864 --> 07:29.696
with old drug-dealing,
murderin' Blaine.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.865
But what about the new,
improved version?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.615
I mean, fair enough.
It's fine.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.037
If you'd just told me,
I would've been on board.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.580
Good on ya, man.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.751
<i>They're playing checkers, my
boy Blaine is playing Monopoly.</i>

07:42.879 --> 07:44.495
So I'm clear,

07:45.256 --> 07:47.339
this is my business?

07:48.093 --> 07:51.586
You and Chief had me going out
and getting food orders for you.

07:52.138 --> 07:52.924
I was your little gofer.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.007
Oh, you're good,
you're so convincing.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.058
You deserve an Emmy.
I mean, you're TV good,

07:58.269 --> 07:59.555
let's not get carried away.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.433
Daniel Day Lewis ain't
shaking in his boots.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.934
You had me mopping up.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.857
You'd send me out of the room when
you and Chief were talking business.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.231
Stop it, Blaine, or I'll
crack open your skull

08:08.446 --> 08:09.903
and feast on those
brains of yours,

08:10.115 --> 08:12.027
see what it feels like to be
that freaking devious.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.733
Tell me where my money is,

08:13.952 --> 08:15.363
and you'll never see me again.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.785
Well, if I was the owner,

08:17.789 --> 08:19.576
wouldn't it make it my money?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.373
Chief is dead.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.870
I got shot.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.622
That is our money.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.749
I don't want to sound
like your mom,

08:25.964 --> 08:28.923
but where'd you last see it?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.884
- Chief had it.
- I'd start there.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.505
See ya around, Blaine.
I quit.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.760
Look, I know it's a little
fuzzy in there,

08:37.976 --> 08:40.342
but I'm pretty sure

08:40.562 --> 08:43.520
I must've had a two-week
notice policy in place here.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.521
Fine. I'll waive it.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.019
But don't expect a
letter of recommendation.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.917
It's going to be awkward.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.875
I'm going to have to talk
to all the people I kidnapped

09:51.091 --> 09:52.457
and drill down on whether
they saw anything

09:52.675 --> 09:53.916
that might get me to Natalie.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.884
Uh, Major...

10:04.479 --> 10:05.765
A hero's return.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.368
It's gonna get bad now.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.869
Now that you've been cleared.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.205
You think?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.218
I was hoping to talk to you
about that girl, Natalie.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.261
If you remember anything,
call me back on this number.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.930
- Thanks.
- There's Clive.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.976
TROOP LEADER: You can't
kill me, I can't die.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.678
TROOPS: You can't kill me, I can't die.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.263
TROOP LEADER: Unless
you shoot me in the eye.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.064
TROOPS: Unless you
shoot me in the eye.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.517
- TROOP LEADER: Sound off.
- TROOPS: One, two.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.021
- TROOP LEADER: Sound off.
- TROOPS: Three, four.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.694
You think those were
all zombies?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.563
We said 0900.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.611
It's 9:00 right now.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.908
If you're early,
you're on time,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.577
if you're on time,
you're late.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.324
Just so I understand...

11:05.623 --> 11:09.037
If we can find you two some new
non-soldier brains, you won't be like this?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.413
Depends on the brains.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.244
If we ate the brains of a
train conductor, for example,

11:12.463 --> 11:13.624
similar issue.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.127
We should head in.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.504
Maybe I'll run into a normal
person we can murder.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.804
<i>TV REPORTER: The Chaos Killer victims

11:22.015 --> 11:23.631
<i>at Max Rager headquarters</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:27.309
<i>and used as guinea pigs

11:37.238 --> 11:41.152

- Oh, great. Send them in.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.337
Hello!

11:55.548 --> 11:56.664
Hello, come in!

11:56.883 --> 11:57.839
Have a seat.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.132
You been watching the news?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.505
So far so good,

12:00.720 --> 12:03.303
the Chaos Killer victims are
coming through like champs.

12:03.514 --> 12:07.383
I downloaded Major and Clive
on what you told me,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.685
about Seattle being
a zombie homeland.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.557
Huh.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.810
I'm guessing I'm the only
non-zombie in the loop.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.106
Oh, no.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.274
Far from it.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.526
We probably have a couple dozen
human employees who are fully briefed.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.697
But those are humans
I know and trust.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.196
Clive has already witnessed
a full-scale zombie outbreak.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.869
That's a genie that can't
really be put back in a bottle.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.869
We want to know what you mean when you
talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.620
How can we know
if we're with you

12:32.835 --> 12:34.371
when we don't even really know
what we're talking about?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.623
Fair enough.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.081
We here at Fillmore-Graves
are preparing for D-Day.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.462
Discovery Day,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.720
the day when humans,
en masse,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.797
learn of our existence.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.382
What do you think
happens then, Liv?

12:48.893 --> 12:52.182
I thought it would be in our best
interests if it didn't get out.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.981
Maybe it won't,
but it probably will.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.149
So what happens when it does?

12:58.361 --> 13:00.148
What happens when humans learn

13:00.363 --> 13:03.356
that there's a few hundred
brain-eating,

13:03.574 --> 13:06.066
highly-contagious zombies
in their midst?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.323
Do you think they'll ask us
to raise our hands

13:08.538 --> 13:12.908
and then they're gonna do their best
to help us survive and assimilate?

13:13.126 --> 13:16.290
Do you think they'll help us get
the brains we need to survive?

13:16.504 --> 13:17.494
Where do you get your brains?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.250
You see what
I'm talking about?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.751
It's a touchy subject.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.464
There are several crematorium
owners here in the Pacific Northwest

13:24.679 --> 13:26.420
who are paying cash

13:26.639 --> 13:29.256
for houses in upscale
neighborhoods for doing nothing more

13:29.475 --> 13:32.513
than de-braining the deceased
and sending those brains our way.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.099
But nobody's answered
my question.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.772
What happens on D-Day?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.519
They exterminate us.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.020
Oh, check out the big brain
on Major.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.354
We here at Fillmore-Graves

13:43.573 --> 13:45.940
do not plan on going
gently into that good night.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.775
What do you plan on doing?

13:48.161 --> 13:51.370
Well, for a start, we're
well-armed and well-trained.

13:51.581 --> 13:55.370
We're also the proud owners
of the formula for Super Max.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.746
No one else gets it.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.827
Max Rager is no longer.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.711
And with Super Max,
we are faster, stronger,

14:02.925 --> 14:06.293
and have more endurance than the
humans who would annihilate us.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.300
Can we get a straight answer
on what you mean when you say,

14:09.515 --> 14:11.928
"Seattle is gonna be the
capital of a zombie homeland"?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.427
Are you declaring war?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.222
See this dot?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.145
It's an island, and we own it.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.148
"Zombie Island."

14:23.363 --> 14:25.195
Sounds like the name of a
summer blockbuster, doesn't it?

14:25.406 --> 14:27.272
You're moving all zombies
to their own island?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.154
Our own island, Liv.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.826
Show some team spirit.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.029
We're building
the infrastructure now.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.988
We're at least a year
and a half away,

14:35.208 --> 14:36.494
but it can hold all of us.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.166
We can self-segregate.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.164
This here,

14:39.712 --> 14:40.998
that's going to be
the schoolhouse.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.876
- "Schoolhouse"?
- There are zombie children?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.502
Why should that be a surprise?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.426
Let's take a walk.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.137
LIV: How did you
become a zombie?

14:51.682 --> 14:53.469
VIVIAN: My husband,
Harrison Graves,

14:53.684 --> 14:56.176
co-founder of the company,
got infected first.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.597
A zombie scratched him,
then extorted him for brains.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.933
$25,000 a month.

15:02.860 --> 15:03.941
Harrison was going
to leave me,

15:04.153 --> 15:05.394
he didn't want to infect me,

15:05.613 --> 15:07.775
and he didn't want me to have
to lead a sexless life.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.365
So one night,
while he was sleeping,

15:10.576 --> 15:12.989
I took his hand
and scratched myself.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.534
I was more willing to live as a
zombie than to live without him.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.282
Where's your husband now?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.665
Well, he figured out a way
to get brains on his own

15:21.879 --> 15:23.370
and told the guy
who was extorting him

15:23.589 --> 15:25.706
that he no longer
needed his services.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.876
A week later, he failed
to come home from work.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.923
I never saw him again.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.300
I'm so sorry.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.090
I never met the zombie who
did it, but one day I will,

15:36.811 --> 15:39.428
and he'll have to learn
that there's a price to pay

15:39.647 --> 15:41.263
for zombie-on-zombie crime.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.195
How did everyone else at
Fillmore-Graves become zombies?

15:52.952 --> 15:55.820
A dozen of our soldiers were
sent to Equatorial Kundu

15:56.038 --> 15:59.076
to evacuate translators and guides
who'd been friendly to the U.S.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.955
My guys were fighting block-by
- block in a rebel neighborhood

16:02.170 --> 16:06.790
when General Masoud detonated a
biological weapon in the sky above them.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.759
My guys showed no symptoms
until they arrived back here

16:10.970 --> 16:12.632
just in time for our
company retreat,

16:12.847 --> 16:14.383
something we do
every July 4th.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.885
Forty-eight hours
into the retreat,

16:16.100 --> 16:18.934
every one of my
employees is sick,

16:19.395 --> 16:20.476
people are going to die.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.101
So you told them how you could
save them all with one scratch?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.354
You see what great lengths I'll
go to to protect these people.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.810
They're my family.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.486
I'm mother to them all.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.366
- So all of these kids are...
- Undead.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.194
- Hello, Miss Vivian!
- Hello, children.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.321
- Clive?
- Wally?

16:41.709 --> 16:42.916
Hey.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.620
So this is where
you've been hiding out.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.580
Wait. Are you one of us now?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.341
Wally, we need you to join us.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.793
You better head back to class.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.008
I'll give Miss Vivian my
information to give to your mom.

16:56.974 --> 16:57.805
We'll get together.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.637
Promise?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.347
Yeah, I promise.

17:06.817 --> 17:07.853
You should tan and dye.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.230
TEACHER: Wally...

17:12.031 --> 17:12.987
How do you...

17:13.574 --> 17:16.567
His family lived
in my building for a while.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.527
You mind?

17:18.746 --> 17:19.906
Of course.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.586
That biological weapon that the
general dropped on his own people?

17:32.176 --> 17:32.916
Yeah?

17:33.135 --> 17:36.719
The people who were infected
developed lesions on their faces,

17:36.931 --> 17:38.138
all over their bodies.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.181
They were incredibly
contagious.

17:40.935 --> 17:45.350
And the people who weren't infected
became so terrified of those who were,

17:45.565 --> 17:48.478
they started shooting
the infected on sight.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.810
That's what's gonna happen
when the people of Seattle

17:51.028 --> 17:53.111
realize there are zombies
living among them.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.983
You really should tan and dye.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.612
We're trying to keep
a secret here.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.001
Super Max-powered zombies
armed to the gills,

18:12.216 --> 18:14.003
ready to do battle once
they're discovered?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.800
And I'm not supposed
to say anything?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.217
Aren't we the
"No Secrets" club?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.264
We're the "No Secrets
Between Us" club.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.303
MAJOR: I think what they're
doing here is smart.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.930
I mean, do we really believe
there's going to be a

18:25.146 --> 18:27.103
"let's talk things out with
the zombies" phase

18:27.315 --> 18:29.056
once the human population
learns we exist?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.608
- I do.
- Once they hear that we eat brains...

18:31.819 --> 18:32.775
(IMITATING GUNSHOT)

18:34.530 --> 18:37.364
An army of trained zombie
mercenaries ready

18:37.575 --> 18:40.318
to defend themselves once
humans discover they exist?

18:40.536 --> 18:43.449
- (WHISTLES)
- They really seem to believe humanity's first impulse

18:43.664 --> 18:45.451
will be to exterminate
zombies.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.034
Nothing in here is going
to hit the spot.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.789
I have a couple of
brains in stock.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.871
I'd rather stay
on Janko brain.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.581
The man is ice cold.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.000
His soldier brain is the only
thing preventing me

18:57.219 --> 18:59.586
from falling apart
grieving for Drake.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.637
It's going to wear off soon.

19:01.849 --> 19:02.805
I know.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.224
I can already feel it.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.557
I wish I had some
hard-as-nails soldier brain.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.933
Why's that?

19:10.733 --> 19:14.317
Because I'm spiraling,
and I can't break out of it.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.735
Spiraling about what?

19:16.530 --> 19:17.611
Peyton.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.984
And Blaine.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.196
And my sitting out in the car

19:22.411 --> 19:24.903

saving the day.

Get over it.

to lean on

19:40.137 --> 19:41.298
when rolling on soldier brain.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.971
You called her "my precious."

19:43.182 --> 19:45.094
You don't plan on throwing
her in Mount Doom, do you?

19:46.435 --> 19:47.892
It had to be Blaine.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.852
I've got good news.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.150
Mr. Boss made it through
customs in Montenegro.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.980
He had a fake passport,
but we have a photo.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.314
We know he's there.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.399
They just don't extradite
to the U.S. in Montenegro.

20:44.618 --> 20:45.950
Which is probably
why he chose it.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.070
Exactly.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.155
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

20:51.292 --> 20:52.453
Nothing to worry about.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.034
That's just
the cremation chamber

20:54.253 --> 20:56.586
reminding me Mrs. Voelker
has returned to dust.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.880
(SIGHING) Okay,

21:00.593 --> 21:01.800
I'll admit it.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.678
I'd be happier if Mr. Boss
had been captured,

21:05.890 --> 21:07.506
or, better yet, killed.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.808
I mean, intellectually, it
wouldn't make any sense for him

21:10.019 --> 21:11.806
to try and take either
one of us out now.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.512
We found so much evidence
in his file,

21:13.731 --> 21:16.769
we could put him away for
30 years on tax crimes alone.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.393
Still, I'm so...

21:21.030 --> 21:21.861
Jumpy.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.487
Hey.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.324
You were just held hostage
by a group of thugs.

21:26.869 --> 21:27.950
That's only natural.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.453
Which gets us to why
I'm really here.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.786
I could've just told you all
that information on the phone

21:34.001 --> 21:35.412
but what I wanted
to do was thank you.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.582
For saving my life.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.005
You don't need to thank me.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.341
I'm the one that should be
apologizing to you.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.718
I mean, you were only
in that situation

21:45.930 --> 21:47.762
because, for reasons that
are unclear to me,

21:47.973 --> 21:49.089
a crime lord wanted me dead.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.300
So, please,

21:52.061 --> 21:54.929
if you're ever
feeling jumpy or whatever,

21:55.940 --> 21:57.147
call me.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.564
I'll come over.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.104
I owe you.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.690
We can play cards
or something. I don't know.

22:02.905 --> 22:06.694
If you had your memory, you'd
understand how ironic your offer is.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.738
Calling Blaine DeBeers for
comfort and protection, huh?

22:09.954 --> 22:12.446
Yeah, it's been made clear
to me I wasn't the nicest guy.

22:14.416 --> 22:18.205
Listen, a few things have been
said over the past couple of days

22:18.420 --> 22:20.036
that led me
to believe that we were...

22:22.091 --> 22:23.298
Um...

22:24.218 --> 22:25.049
Yeah?

22:26.136 --> 22:27.297
Were we a couple?

22:28.389 --> 22:29.425
(SCOFFS)

22:41.652 --> 22:43.735
(BLENDER WHIRRING)

22:47.074 --> 22:47.985
BARISTA: Sir?

22:55.708 --> 22:59.418
This, this,
and a large Americano, please.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.586
Large Americano!

23:26.906 --> 23:28.192
CLIVE: How many
of them are there?

23:28.407 --> 23:29.523
RAVI: Seventeen.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.654
Seventeen doses of the cure.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.737
But now we're looking at
a few hundred zombies.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.787
- Can you make more?
- Not at this time.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.080
We're out of
the key ingredient,

23:38.292 --> 23:39.703
and we don't know
how to get more.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.126
So why haven't Liv
and Major taken the cure?

23:42.463 --> 23:45.171
Side effects include severe
retrograde amnesia.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.539
Like Blaine.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.253
"Retrograde"? That's like...

23:48.636 --> 23:50.298
- Everything, isn't it?
- Not quite.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.295
One's procedural memories
remain intact,

23:52.514 --> 23:54.130
but everything else,
episodic memories,

23:54.350 --> 23:56.592
autobiographical memories,
vanish.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.018
That's the choice for
Liv and Major, then?

23:59.605 --> 24:01.346
Take the cure,
return to human form,

24:01.523 --> 24:03.389
but suffer this
retrograde amnesia?

24:03.609 --> 24:04.474
Yeah.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.980
Though it's a bit more
pressing for Major.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.858
He is on borrowed time.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.736
You think the memory-loss side
effect of Cure Two is bad?

24:11.951 --> 24:15.444
The side effect of Cure One,
the cure Major took, is death.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.495
If his response is
like our test rat,

24:17.706 --> 24:19.868
his lungs will begin
filling with fluid.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.458
He'll suffer a terminal
case of pneumonia.

24:22.670 --> 24:23.877
Or he can take Cure Two...

24:24.088 --> 24:25.420
And lose all his memories.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.997
Maybe.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.707
I don't have any way
to recreate the cure,

24:28.926 --> 24:31.168
so I started taking
a new approach.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.142
What if I could come
up with a formula

24:40.354 --> 24:42.061
that could reverse
memory loss?

24:42.272 --> 24:43.433
(RATS SQUEAKING)

24:46.193 --> 24:48.810
- It's all right. You don't need to show me...
- Too late.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.778
This is my jam.

24:55.577 --> 24:56.988
(BUZZING)

25:04.837 --> 25:06.954
So, the eJectrons in
this sodium solution,

25:07.172 --> 25:08.629
when charged by
a positive cathode,

25:08.841 --> 25:10.673
release stress hormones
that stimulate the amygdala

25:10.884 --> 25:13.752
and strengthen the signal sent to
neurons required for memory storage.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.463
That's not how I'd do it.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.259
I'm close to full
memory restoration.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.594
For 17 lucky zombies.
What about the rest?

25:22.813 --> 25:23.974
I don't like thinking
about that.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.430
Well, who'll decide
who gets the cure?

25:25.649 --> 25:26.856
I don't like thinking
about that, either.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.101
LIV: Ravi! Clive!

25:33.198 --> 25:35.155
- Good, you're here.
- Something wrong?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.734
I'm driving to work and I'm
flipping around on the radio dial,

25:37.953 --> 25:40.070
and I land on a promo for
the new Chuck Burd show.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.530
He's got a new show?

25:41.540 --> 25:42.906
He's turned
conspiracy theorist,

25:43.125 --> 25:44.957
one of those "9/11 was
an inside job" crackpots.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.202
According to the promo,
he's about to speak live

25:47.421 --> 25:49.003
to what he claims
is an eyewitness

25:49.214 --> 25:50.250
to the Max Rager massacre.

25:50.466 --> 25:53.004
Who, they claim, has an
unbelievable story to tell

25:53.218 --> 25:54.959
that will shake our faith
in our institutions.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.961
Well, any idea who this
eyewitness might be?

25:57.181 --> 25:58.217
None.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.430
We need to stop
that interview.

25:59.641 --> 26:00.722
Why didn't you drive
straight there?

or a siren.

running scared,

chasing them.

to talk about.
