01:42.170 --> 01:42.906
Sir.

01:44.907 --> 01:46.374
These lads were on a training run

01:46.375 --> 01:48.168
- when they discovered the body.
- Training?

01:48.169 --> 01:51.979
Yes, sir. For the upcoming
Olympics in Paris, apparently.

01:52.014 --> 01:55.314
Even though the club isn't
sponsoring any track athletes.

01:55.349 --> 01:58.113
Apparently they don't think we
can beat the famous George Orton.

01:58.114 --> 01:59.853
Excuse me.

01:59.887 --> 02:03.890
Emily Grace?

02:03.925 --> 02:06.426
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Ralph?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.761
It's been a long time.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.163
- I haven't seen you since...
- I called off my engagement. Yes.

02:11.197 --> 02:15.167
- Dr. Grace?
- We miss you at the club.

02:15.234 --> 02:17.670
- I must go.
- Did you know that

02:17.704 --> 02:19.872
the Club is sending a croquet
player to the Olympics?

02:19.906 --> 02:22.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.043
- Doctor!
- Didn't that used to be your sport?

02:25.110 --> 02:27.144
Dr. Grace!

02:29.081 --> 02:30.682
Sorry, Detective Murdoch.

02:30.716 --> 02:33.017
Who was that chap?

02:33.052 --> 02:36.287
My apologies, Detective.
An unexpected reunion.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.658
Um, upon first examination,

02:41.659 --> 02:44.227
it would appear this woman likely drowned.

02:44.295 --> 02:46.763
And the wound on her head?

02:46.798 --> 02:48.599
Oh.

02:48.666 --> 02:52.435
Yes. Uh, that would suggest otherwise.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.437
I'll need a full report, Dr. Grace,

02:54.472 --> 02:57.056
at your earliest possible
convenience, of course.

02:57.374 --> 02:58.540
Um.

03:17.394 --> 03:19.996
So, how did you know these
chaps who found the body?

03:20.031 --> 03:21.998
The Toronto Athletic Club.

03:22.066 --> 03:24.134
Why?

03:27.104 --> 03:29.205
George, are you jealous?

03:29.272 --> 03:32.708
The Athletic Club. I've never
been through the front door.

03:32.776 --> 03:34.509
I was a member once.

03:34.577 --> 03:37.411
But after I broke off
my engagement to Jerome,

03:37.446 --> 03:39.247
I wasn't quite as welcome.

03:39.314 --> 03:42.951
I do miss it sometimes. I
was quite the croquet player.

03:42.985 --> 03:44.953
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.021
City champion two years in a row.

03:47.089 --> 03:50.024
And now somebody from that very
club is off to the Olympics?

03:50.092 --> 03:51.892
- So it seems.
- Emily, that could be you.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.595
- I don't know, George.
- I think you do.

03:55.663 --> 03:59.599
Dr. Grace, your report?

03:59.667 --> 04:03.203
Detective. Certainly.

04:03.271 --> 04:05.939
Our victim did indeed drown.

04:05.974 --> 04:07.940
And the head wound?

04:07.975 --> 04:11.077
Occurred ante-mortem. The
wound is a substantial one.

04:11.145 --> 04:13.079
She would have been
unconscious after such a blow

04:13.147 --> 04:16.115
and would likely have died from
it had she not drowned first.

04:16.149 --> 04:18.084
So she was struck first, and then drowned.

04:18.152 --> 04:21.320
I believe so. Also, the same
phylum mastigophora were found

04:21.353 --> 04:24.322
present in both the water
in her lungs and the lake.

04:24.356 --> 04:26.424
So she died where she was found.

04:26.458 --> 04:28.393
Have you established a time of death?

04:28.460 --> 04:30.829
Between 7 and 9 o'clock last evening.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.234
Her name is Judith Winslow.

04:36.269 --> 04:38.136
The photo came from her friend,

04:38.171 --> 04:39.804
Miss Sophia Lucas.

04:39.838 --> 04:41.806
She reported Miss Winslow
missing first thing this morning.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.775
She hasn't budged since.

04:44.843 --> 04:47.144
Dead?

04:47.179 --> 04:49.346
I'm afraid so.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.716
Miss Lucas, you and Miss Winslow
live at the same boarding house?

04:54.319 --> 04:56.339
- Was she home last night?
- No.

04:56.554 --> 04:58.855
We had plans to attend the
music hall, but she cancelled.

04:58.889 --> 05:01.358
- Do you know why?
- I imagine it had to do

05:01.392 --> 05:03.927
with her work. And what work was that?

05:03.961 --> 05:07.263
She was a secretary at the
financial firm of Mr. Alvin Storey.

05:07.298 --> 05:10.467
- Did Miss Winslow have any enemies?
- No.

05:10.501 --> 05:13.302
She was the sweetest girl.

05:13.337 --> 05:16.271
Thank you, Miss Lucas.

05:16.306 --> 05:17.840
George,

05:17.874 --> 05:20.309
please accompany Miss Lucas home

05:20.344 --> 05:22.578
and begin a search of Miss Winslow's room.

05:22.612 --> 05:24.179
Sir.

05:34.390 --> 05:36.458
Mr. Storey, do you know

05:36.525 --> 05:38.960
- a Miss Judith Winslow?
- Oh, yes, of course.

05:38.994 --> 05:42.530
She works here. Right over here.

05:42.565 --> 05:44.531
Oh, it seems she's not in.

05:44.566 --> 05:48.736
No. No, she wouldn't be.
You see, she's been murdered.

05:50.705 --> 05:52.639
Well, that is terrible.

05:52.674 --> 05:55.409
Was Miss Winslow at work yesterday?

05:55.443 --> 05:57.344
I believe so.

05:57.379 --> 05:59.346
And what time did she leave here?

05:59.413 --> 06:02.348
Seven o'clock, I imagine. That's
when the ladies usually leave.

06:02.383 --> 06:06.218
Did you happen to notice anything
unusual about Miss Winslow yesterday?

06:06.253 --> 06:09.856
Did she appear anxious,
or different in any way?

06:09.923 --> 06:11.905
I'm afraid I wouldn't know, Detective.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.813
I never paid much attention to her.

06:23.903 --> 06:26.037
Emily Grace.

06:26.105 --> 06:29.841
How courageous of you.
The sign-in is right here.

06:29.909 --> 06:31.942
- Are you on the team?
- No.

06:32.010 --> 06:35.579
Not me. I'm just presiding over the trials.

06:35.607 --> 06:38.542
Truth be told, we've only
had one competitor so far.

06:38.610 --> 06:41.846
No one dared contest her.
And who would that be?

06:41.913 --> 06:45.249
Emily Grace.

06:45.316 --> 06:47.851
Hello, Eustacia.

06:47.918 --> 06:49.853
You seem surprised.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.621
I can't imagine why.

06:51.655 --> 06:55.224
After your ignominious departure,
the croquet title went to me.

06:55.292 --> 06:57.927
Well, you always did like my discards.

06:59.897 --> 07:03.766
I'll remember those words while
I'm strolling the Rive Gauche.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.368
We'll see about that.

07:15.277 --> 07:16.177
Sir,

07:16.245 --> 07:18.280
I've found a couple of interesting things.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.948
This is a, uh, diary of sorts.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.418
The last entry was dated two days ago.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.888
The day before she died. "Maple Cottage."

07:26.922 --> 07:30.792
And this is a train schedule for Kleinburg.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.694
She has an aunt in Kleinburg
whom she visits rather frequently.

07:33.729 --> 07:35.796
Another thing, sir. It
seems that Miss Winslow was

07:35.830 --> 07:38.031
also employed by the Toronto Gazette.

07:38.065 --> 07:39.999
Doing what?

07:40.067 --> 07:42.035
She was trying to be a reporter,

07:42.069 --> 07:45.038
but all the editor would let her
write was the Lady Fay column.

07:45.072 --> 07:47.441
- Lady Fay?
- It's an etiquette column, sir.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.609
You know, how to dress the
table for company and so on.

07:49.677 --> 07:53.111
Apparently she wrote the one about which
tie a man should wear to which occasion.

07:53.146 --> 07:55.548
Did you know, sir, that white
ties are only for formal events?

07:55.582 --> 07:58.484
I almost bought a white tie once,
but there was a green one there

07:58.518 --> 08:01.954
that seemed to bring my eyes out
more, or so the lady said George.

08:01.988 --> 08:04.056
Judith wanted to be a serious journalist.

08:04.090 --> 08:05.813
She was always looking
for the one big story

08:05.814 --> 08:07.521
that would make her a household name.

08:08.594 --> 08:11.830
- Apparently without much success.
- Sir,

08:11.864 --> 08:15.099
perhaps she recently
stumbled upon something.

08:15.133 --> 08:19.971
And perhaps that something
was in Mr. Storey's office.

08:20.005 --> 08:23.607
You manage the assets of some
of the city's wealthiest men.

08:23.641 --> 08:27.945
That I do. Detective, I really
don't have time for this today.

08:27.979 --> 08:30.046
Well, perhaps we can have this conversation

08:30.081 --> 08:32.182
down at the station house,
if that will help you

08:32.216 --> 08:34.784
better concentrate.

08:34.818 --> 08:37.120
Were you aware

08:37.154 --> 08:40.255
that Miss Winslow had
aspirations towards journalism?

08:40.289 --> 08:42.725
Well, if I had been, I
never would have ceded

08:42.759 --> 08:45.027
to my sister's request and hired her.

08:45.061 --> 08:48.130
- We deal with sensitive information here.
- Sensitive?

08:48.164 --> 08:51.367
Yes, sir. Sensitive, but not illegal.

08:51.401 --> 08:55.304
All of my clients' finances
are completely above board.

08:55.338 --> 08:57.305
I should very much like to verify that.

08:57.339 --> 09:02.377
Oh, please do. Your time is yours to waste.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.445
May I?

09:04.514 --> 09:06.648
May I?

09:44.851 --> 09:47.319
- Any luck, Murdoch?
- Sir,

09:47.354 --> 09:49.321
we've been through Storey's accounts.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.323
Everything looks perfectly legitimate.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.325
Miss Winslow may have been on to something,

09:53.360 --> 09:55.327
but I doubt it had anything
to do with Alvin Storey.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.629
Something'll turn up. It always does.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.131
Sirs. There's been another murder.

10:00.199 --> 10:03.401
It's another young woman, I'm afraid.

10:03.469 --> 10:06.137
Her name's Ethel Morgan. She lives...

10:06.205 --> 10:08.806
well, lived... in a boarding house nearby.

10:08.874 --> 10:11.476
A perfectly respectable neighbourhood.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.478
And judging by her state of dress,

10:13.546 --> 10:15.813
a perfectly respectable woman.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.949
I wonder what she was doing in
a laneway this time of night.

10:19.016 --> 10:21.785
Perhaps she wasn't here voluntarily.

10:21.852 --> 10:24.054
The killer made no
attempts to hide her body.

10:24.122 --> 10:27.891
She was drowned. And certainly not here.

10:27.959 --> 10:30.494
Detective, take a look at this.

10:30.562 --> 10:31.995
Two victims,

10:32.063 --> 10:35.764
two nights in a row, killed
apparently the same way.

10:35.832 --> 10:37.501
Not another sequential killer.

10:37.502 --> 10:39.140
I certainly hope not, sir.

10:39.304 --> 10:41.440
I found this in her skirt pocket.

10:41.873 --> 10:45.374
It seemed strange enough to be of interest.

10:45.442 --> 10:47.477
Yes.

10:47.511 --> 10:50.645
That's of great interest,
Dr. Grace. Thank you.

10:54.543 --> 10:57.243
It could be an identifier of sorts.

10:57.278 --> 10:59.212
- Identifier?
- These are unique pieces

10:59.280 --> 11:02.348
- of what could be a larger symbol.
- But to what end?

11:02.416 --> 11:05.220
Pieces of a whole could mean that

11:05.221 --> 11:08.166
these woman are to him
pieces of a larger scheme.

11:08.455 --> 11:11.091
But until we know what the symbol is...

11:11.125 --> 11:14.259
We have no way of knowing how
many victims are forthcoming.

11:14.294 --> 11:16.862
For once, Julia, I
sincerely hope you're wrong.

11:21.134 --> 11:24.436
Sir, the landlady says
that she was a student.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.605
Studied at that Baptist
college up on Bloor Street.

11:26.639 --> 11:28.106
McMaster University.

11:28.140 --> 11:30.441
With an apparent interest
in ancient religions.

11:30.475 --> 11:32.944
Did you find any connection
to Judith Winslow?

11:32.978 --> 11:37.615
No, sir. The landlady had never
seen nor... heard of Miss Winslow.

11:37.649 --> 11:40.118
That is a beautiful
typewriter. Look at that, sir,

11:40.152 --> 11:42.286
how smooth... the keys are.

11:42.321 --> 11:43.954
Oh, and this pen, wow.

11:43.988 --> 11:45.956
George, pack up Miss Morgan's things.

11:45.990 --> 11:47.958
We'll have a closer look
at the station house.

11:47.992 --> 11:49.893
Sir, will do.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.131
Sir.

11:54.165 --> 11:57.735
"Meet me in my office
at 5:30." Signed "MB".

11:57.769 --> 12:00.636
Dated yesterday.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.238
Hm.

12:14.017 --> 12:16.484
Yes, Detective, I wrote this note.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.486
I am Miss Morgan's thesis advisor.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.589
What time did Miss Morgan
leave you last night?

12:21.624 --> 12:23.759
She never arrived.

12:23.793 --> 12:26.094
Did that not strike you as odd?

12:26.129 --> 12:28.596
Miss Morgan has other interests

12:28.631 --> 12:30.766
that often divert her attention.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.304
She considers herself
something of a crusader

12:33.305 --> 12:35.028
in the women's suffrage movement.

12:35.030 --> 12:37.671
- Which you oppose?
- Quite the opposite.

12:37.735 --> 12:41.238
There is not a single female Ph.D.
graduate from a Canadian university.

12:41.306 --> 12:43.507
Miss Morgan is on the cusp of greatness...

12:43.541 --> 12:45.209
if she would only focus.

12:45.243 --> 12:47.311
Tea?

12:54.474 --> 12:58.978
A scene from the Shahnameh,
the Persian "Book of Kings".

12:59.046 --> 13:01.881
That is the story of Zal and Rudabeh.

13:01.916 --> 13:04.383
Their great love was
sanctioned by the gods,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.551
but not by their families.

13:06.619 --> 13:10.055
Love conquered prejudice, and
they lived happily ever after.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.857
A much more generous ending
than Shakespeare's version.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.228
You are Persian?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.564
On my father's side,
but I was born in India.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.967
May I ask, is Miss Morgan
in some kind of trouble?

13:23.035 --> 13:26.703
She was murdered. Drowned.

13:26.771 --> 13:29.273
Drowned.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.178
How awful.

13:39.116 --> 13:41.051
Dr. Grace has determined

13:41.118 --> 13:42.919
that Ethel Morgan was
drowned in her own bathtub.

13:42.987 --> 13:46.222
- Yes, sir. Unfortunately, that doesn't help us.
- No connection, then?

13:46.290 --> 13:49.326
Well, sir, we know that both
women attended university.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.395
Judith Winslow went to Victoria
College and got a degree in literature,

13:53.463 --> 13:55.831
and Ethel Morgan was in the
middle of her Master's degree

13:55.865 --> 13:58.800
in ancient religions
at McMaster University.

13:58.868 --> 14:02.304
So, they went to different
schools, studied different courses.

14:02.372 --> 14:05.607
- No friends in common, no hobbies, nothing.
- No, sir,

14:05.641 --> 14:08.709
but both women were killed
exactly the same way,

14:08.743 --> 14:12.180
and both were in possession
of this same identifier.

14:12.247 --> 14:15.083
What about suspects? Alvin Storey?

14:15.117 --> 14:17.885
- No connection to Ethel Morgan.
- What about the other fellow,

14:17.919 --> 14:22.223
- Bahmanyar?
- No connection to Judith Winslow.

14:22.257 --> 14:24.691
Sirs, I've been going through
the young women's effects.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.226
And you've found something?

14:26.260 --> 14:29.029
- It might seem silly, sir.
- Out with it, Crabtree.

14:29.097 --> 14:31.064
Well, Miss Winslow and Miss Morgan were

14:31.099 --> 14:33.367
both in possession of
the same fountain pen.

14:33.434 --> 14:35.735
Yes, Crabtree, both girls could write.

14:35.769 --> 14:37.904
Not exactly breaking the
case wide open, are you?

14:37.938 --> 14:40.239
No, sir, but this is a
particularly fine pen,

14:40.273 --> 14:43.609
Even more fine than the Parker
Gold Filigree Lucky Curve.

14:43.643 --> 14:46.278
You see, sirs, the nib is made of gold.

14:46.313 --> 14:49.081
This makes it more resilient
to the acid in the ink.

14:49.116 --> 14:51.350
I myself have been envious
of this pen for some time,

14:51.385 --> 14:54.353
but on a constable's salary
it's unlikely that George,

14:54.388 --> 14:55.988
how exclusive is this pen?

14:56.022 --> 14:58.223
Sir, this particular one costs $20.

14:58.257 --> 15:00.925
There's only one stationer
in the city that sells them.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.061
Yes, these most certainly came from us.

15:03.095 --> 15:04.562
Wonderful.

15:04.596 --> 15:08.400
Have you ever seen
either of these two women?

15:08.434 --> 15:12.836
No, but I've been in England
for the last two months.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.273
I just got back yesterday.
My clerk might know more.

15:16.307 --> 15:18.375
Mueller!

15:20.711 --> 15:23.747
Good day. Detective Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

15:23.781 --> 15:26.983
What can you tell me
about these fountain pens?

15:27.018 --> 15:28.484
Wait...

15:28.519 --> 15:30.686
St... stop!

15:38.595 --> 15:40.663
All right.

15:44.867 --> 15:47.102
Do you know these women?

15:47.136 --> 15:49.637
She came into the shop a few weeks ago,

15:49.672 --> 15:51.506
with her father.

15:51.574 --> 15:55.810
He bought our best typewriter
and... and one of those pens.

15:55.878 --> 15:57.946
And this one?

15:58.013 --> 15:59.747
That's Judith.

15:59.782 --> 16:03.150
She and I went to university together.

16:03.185 --> 16:05.819
When did you last see her?

16:05.853 --> 16:09.323
I don't know. A few days ago.

16:09.391 --> 16:11.825
Look, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.

16:11.859 --> 16:14.161
Couldn't help what?

16:14.229 --> 16:17.163
I knew she wanted it.

16:17.231 --> 16:20.866
You knew she wanted what, exactly?

16:23.504 --> 16:27.307
The pen. I gave her this
fancy gold fountain pen.

16:27.374 --> 16:30.810
She couldn't afford
it, and neither could I.

16:34.581 --> 16:38.217
- Julia?
- Can you believe that of all the houses in Toronto,

16:38.284 --> 16:40.486
he chooses one a mere three blocks from me?

16:40.520 --> 16:43.355
- What are you talking about?
- Darcy has purchased

16:43.389 --> 16:45.157
a house on Jarvis Street.

16:45.225 --> 16:48.226
Perhaps he simply wanted to
be closer to the hospital.

16:48.293 --> 16:50.694
William, please. He knows full well

16:50.762 --> 16:52.830
that I live on Linden Street
and that my route to work is

16:52.897 --> 16:54.865
directly past his new front door.

16:54.899 --> 16:56.900
I don't think it was intentional.

16:56.968 --> 17:00.438
I don't know what I find more
infuriating, Darcy's blatant attempt

17:00.472 --> 17:03.574
to distress me, or your
refusal to acknowledge it!

17:03.609 --> 17:05.040
Miss Lucas.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.042
Detective, I'm sorry to bother you,

17:07.111 --> 17:08.912
but I've remembered something
that might be helpful.

17:08.913 --> 17:09.913
Please.

17:10.114 --> 17:14.416
The night before Judith died,
there was a letter waiting for her.

17:14.484 --> 17:16.719
- What was in the letter?
- I don't know, but it was

17:16.753 --> 17:19.955
after Judith read it that she cancelled
our plans to attend the music hall.

17:19.990 --> 17:23.259
Hm. Do you know where the letter is now?

17:23.292 --> 17:25.261
No, but I did catch of glimpse of it.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.596
It looked as though it was
written in a man's hand.

17:27.631 --> 17:30.533
Ethel Morgan was to meet a man the night

17:30.567 --> 17:33.402
- that she died.
- I'm sorry, did you say...

17:36.505 --> 17:38.739
Miss Lucas?

17:38.807 --> 17:42.043
- No, I just...
- Are you quite all right?

17:42.077 --> 17:44.111
Uh, yes, yes. I should go.

17:46.248 --> 17:50.017
William, your Miss Lucas
knows more than she's saying.

17:50.052 --> 17:53.253
Yes. It seems she recognized
the name "Ethel Morgan".

17:53.288 --> 17:55.989
Perhaps you've found your connection.

18:04.365 --> 18:06.166
Detective William Murdoch.

18:06.201 --> 18:08.434
It's Sophia Lucas. I must speak with you.

18:08.468 --> 18:11.604
Meet me at 8 o'clock in Judith's room.

18:14.107 --> 18:16.875
Miss Lucas? Hello?

18:31.324 --> 18:34.826
- Where is she?
- Sir.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.595
You're needed.

18:40.732 --> 18:43.701
- Sir, this way.
- Jackson, what's happened?

18:43.735 --> 18:46.136
Best you see for yourself, sir.

18:49.574 --> 18:51.642
Sophia Lucas?

18:56.681 --> 18:58.115
No,

18:58.182 --> 18:59.950
it's not her.

18:59.984 --> 19:02.719
Then who is this?

19:07.970 --> 19:09.438
Do you know who she is?

19:09.472 --> 19:12.674
The landlady identified
her as Virginie Rousseau.

19:15.645 --> 19:17.745
Dr. Grace?

19:17.813 --> 19:21.081
Oh, I've found, in the
case of multiple deaths,

19:21.149 --> 19:27.755
a simple system of organization makes
the cold chamber much easier to navigate.

19:27.823 --> 19:30.591
The foot is left exposed, and a quick

19:30.659 --> 19:32.392
reference card is affixed,

19:32.460 --> 19:35.395
allowing immediate access to
whichever corpse is required.

19:35.463 --> 19:37.930
How very organized.

19:37.998 --> 19:40.333
- And your findings?
- It works quite well.

19:40.401 --> 19:43.169
Of Miss Rousseau.

19:43.237 --> 19:45.171
Yes, of course.

19:45.239 --> 19:48.107
She died at approximately
8 o'clock last night.

19:48.175 --> 19:51.209
The manner of death was identical
to that of Ethel Morgan's.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.612
First she suffered a blow to the head,

19:53.680 --> 19:56.348
which rendered her
unconscious, but not fatally so.

19:56.416 --> 19:57.883
Then she was drowned.

19:57.950 --> 20:00.619
So all three women
suffered a blow to the head.

20:00.687 --> 20:03.121
Yes. You'll be wanting this.

20:03.189 --> 20:06.090
It was also in her pocket.

20:11.730 --> 20:14.198
George, have you completed your interviews?

20:14.232 --> 20:16.333
Yes, sir. Sir, we have a witness

20:16.402 --> 20:19.470
who saw a woman coming out of
Miss Rousseau's room at 9 o'clock.

20:19.538 --> 20:21.638
I showed her a picture of Sophia Lucas.

20:21.706 --> 20:23.807
The witness confirms it was she.

20:23.875 --> 20:26.843
Very good, George. Henry!

20:26.878 --> 20:30.514
- Find Sophia Lucas as soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.

20:30.548 --> 20:32.982
Sophia Lucas has played
us for patsies, then.

20:33.050 --> 20:36.819
Possibly, sir. But her
voice betrayed genuine fear.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.721
Or genuine acting talent.

20:38.789 --> 20:42.491
She was the last one seen with the victim.

20:42.526 --> 20:46.161
What is that?

20:46.195 --> 20:49.698
A Persian eagle.

20:54.069 --> 20:56.304
It is a Faravahar,

20:56.338 --> 21:00.241
a symbol of Zoroastrianism,
the religion of Ancient Persia.

21:00.275 --> 21:03.110
- What does it represent?
- A guardian angel,

21:03.145 --> 21:06.113
and reminder to follow the
principles of Zoroaster,

21:06.148 --> 21:08.515
to be worthy of union with Ahura Mazda,

21:08.550 --> 21:11.017
the true, uncreated god.

21:11.052 --> 21:14.054
A guardian angel? Seems
like a strange symbol

21:14.088 --> 21:16.056
to place on the dead bodies of young women.

21:16.090 --> 21:18.492
Professor, do you know of any other

21:18.526 --> 21:20.928
- Zoroastrians in Toronto?
- Pashti.

21:20.962 --> 21:23.764
And if I did, I'd sorely like to meet them.

21:23.798 --> 21:26.532
As far as I know,
Detective, I am the only one.

21:29.202 --> 21:31.270
Pashti.

21:31.304 --> 21:33.606
Detective,

21:33.640 --> 21:36.008
your figure seems to be missing its tail.

21:44.350 --> 21:47.919
Sir, there's a fourth piece.

21:47.954 --> 21:50.054
That means there's a fourth victim.

21:50.089 --> 21:53.424
We'd best find Sophia Lucas.

21:53.459 --> 21:55.627
Crabtree, where's Miss Lucas?

21:55.661 --> 21:58.796
She hasn't been seen since last night,
sir, before she telephoned the detective.

21:58.864 --> 22:01.966
Right. I'll get all the lads
on it, whatever it takes.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.134
Miss Lucas is neck-deep in all of this.

22:04.168 --> 22:06.804
- She's our best suspect.
- Or our next victim.

22:06.838 --> 22:09.473
- Hm.
- Inspector.

22:09.508 --> 22:12.675
Julia. Thank you for coming. George?

22:12.710 --> 22:15.253
Ah, sir, our latest victim,
Miss Rousseau, comes from...

22:15.254 --> 22:16.510
Rye... mousky?

22:16.514 --> 22:18.515
- Rimouski, in Quebec?
- That's the one, sir.

22:18.582 --> 22:20.783
She came to Toronto to
study at St. Hilda's College.

22:20.818 --> 22:24.621
Apparently her parents would only
allow her to attend an all-women school.

22:24.655 --> 22:26.265
And there are such schools in Quebec.

22:26.266 --> 22:28.460
Yes, but it seems she wasn't
accepted into any of them.

22:28.461 --> 22:30.993
She wanted to become a doctor,
but consistently failed her exams.

22:31.110 --> 22:33.712
Did she know Miss Winslow or Miss Morgan?

22:33.780 --> 22:36.247
- I don't think so, sir.
- What about Miss Lucas?

22:36.282 --> 22:37.883
Not as far as I can tell.

22:37.917 --> 22:41.553
So our only common factor
is that all three women were

22:41.588 --> 22:45.890
university educated. Could that
be why they were being targeted?

22:45.924 --> 22:49.060
It's a theory. It would fit with
the non-traditional career paths

22:49.128 --> 22:53.531
each of these women had chosen...
professor, doctor, journalist.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.400
Right then, George,

22:55.468 --> 22:56.934
have a look at our recent cases.

22:56.969 --> 22:59.404
See if there are any complaints
from university-educated women

22:59.472 --> 23:02.406
- who are being threatened or attacked.
- I know of a place

23:02.474 --> 23:05.109
where you could speak to many
of these women themselves.

23:05.143 --> 23:07.677
And this is?

23:07.745 --> 23:09.713
Toronto Adelphean Society,

23:09.747 --> 23:13.850
modelled after an American
fraternity for women founded in 1851.

23:13.918 --> 23:17.353
Amazingly, the Americans began
educating their women long before we did.

23:17.421 --> 23:19.899
I wish there had been a
society when I was at school,

23:19.900 --> 23:22.119
but we were only a handful then.

23:22.192 --> 23:25.928
Those were pioneering days.
We have it much easier now.

23:25.996 --> 23:28.397
Do you know Judith Winslow?

23:28.465 --> 23:29.932
Of course.

23:29.966 --> 23:32.935
Judith was like an older sister to me,

23:33.003 --> 23:35.537
not just a fraternity sister.

23:35.605 --> 23:38.773
It was becae of her that I had the
courage to become a student myself.

23:39.807 --> 23:43.077
How very sad what happened
to her. And the others.

23:43.112 --> 23:46.281
- The others?
- Ethel and Virginie.

23:46.315 --> 23:49.250
We've been quite devastated by it all.

23:49.317 --> 23:53.554
Miss Gregson, are you telling me
that you knew all of these women?

23:53.622 --> 23:55.822
Why, yes. They were three
of the founding members,

23:55.857 --> 23:57.262
along with Sophia and Amelia.

23:57.263 --> 23:59.241
- Sophia Lucas?
- Yes.

23:59.361 --> 24:02.563
In the beginning it was
more like a secret society,

24:02.597 --> 24:05.165
with rituals and rules...
white robes and all.

24:05.199 --> 24:07.867
Now it's more of a study group,

24:07.901 --> 24:10.270
especially after what happened.

24:10.304 --> 24:12.004
After what happened?

24:12.039 --> 24:14.407
Three years ago, a member died.

24:14.441 --> 24:18.611
Amelia Richards. She committed suicide.

24:18.646 --> 24:21.280
How, exactly?

24:21.314 --> 24:23.782
She drowned.

24:27.820 --> 24:30.556
Amelia was always frail. Poor thing.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.824
Always had trouble with her lungs.

24:32.858 --> 24:35.827
But it didn't stop her from
doing whatever she wanted.

24:35.861 --> 24:40.364
She was so close to
graduating from university.

24:42.534 --> 24:44.935
In the weeks prior to
your daughter's death,

24:44.969 --> 24:47.438
was she at all unhappy?

24:47.472 --> 24:50.374
She was happier than I'd ever seen her.

24:50.409 --> 24:53.177
But so secretive.

24:53.211 --> 24:54.844
How do you mean, secretive?

24:54.878 --> 24:57.347
Going out at all hours, never telling me

24:57.381 --> 25:00.350
who she was with, or,
worse, lying about it.

25:00.384 --> 25:02.819
- This was unlike her?
- Oh, yes.

25:02.853 --> 25:05.888
- We'd always been very close.
- Mrs. Richards,

25:05.923 --> 25:08.391
could there have been
a man in Amelia's life?

25:08.426 --> 25:12.328
I've often wondered that myself.

25:12.362 --> 25:15.664
Because of this.

25:15.699 --> 25:18.734
I found it after she passed.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.236
It looks like a courting gift,

25:20.270 --> 25:22.504
though I've never seen
the likes of it before.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.244
So you knew Amelia Richards?

25:29.311 --> 25:31.246
She was a student of mine, yes.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.180
As was Ethel Morgan.

25:33.215 --> 25:36.183
And you surely know what
happened to Miss Richards.

25:36.252 --> 25:38.586
Yes. A tragedy. Prejudice
can be hard to overcome.

25:38.654 --> 25:39.655
Prejudice?

25:39.656 --> 25:42.509
Yes. Female students are
often subjected to derision.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.359
I imagine it's not unlike
being of a different religion.

25:45.426 --> 25:47.026
People can be cruel.

25:47.094 --> 25:49.028
Was Amelia Richards ever threatened?

25:49.063 --> 25:52.633
- I wouldn't know.
- But you'd know about this.

25:55.336 --> 25:58.036
Do you know who this belonged to?

25:58.104 --> 26:00.539
Amelia Richards.

26:00.607 --> 26:03.542
Do you know how she came
to be in possession of it?

26:03.610 --> 26:05.544
You said yourself that there are

26:05.612 --> 26:07.546
very few Pashti in Toronto.

26:07.614 --> 26:10.883
Presumably this type of token
would be very difficult to come by.

26:10.950 --> 26:14.253
Mr. Bahmanyar, we know bloody
well that you gave it to her.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.554
She was my Rudabeh,

26:16.622 --> 26:18.723
my forbidden love,

26:18.792 --> 26:21.226
but her parents would have
never sanctioned our union,

26:21.294 --> 26:23.706
and my religion does not allow
marriage outside the faith.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.907
It was hopeless.

26:25.198 --> 26:27.132
She simply couldn't bear it.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.701
- Who else knew of your affair?
- Not a soul.

26:29.769 --> 26:32.469
I would have lost my job, and
she would have been expelled.

26:32.537 --> 26:34.705
How did you know Judith Winslow

26:34.773 --> 26:37.008
- and Virginie Rousseau?
- I don't.

26:37.075 --> 26:39.376
Where were you the last
three nights at 8 o'clock?

26:39.444 --> 26:42.113
Here. Alone.

26:42.181 --> 26:44.215
And it's Mr. Bahmanyar.

26:47.084 --> 26:48.551
Oh, he's good for it.

26:48.585 --> 26:50.753
Slippery bloody foreigner. Sir.

26:50.822 --> 26:53.824
Ah, yes?

26:57.494 --> 27:01.264
So, you are really going
to try to take me on?

27:01.332 --> 27:04.133
I am, whether or not
you allow me to practice.

27:04.167 --> 27:06.268
I have earned my spot on the team.

27:06.303 --> 27:08.537
I object to you being able to contest it.

27:08.604 --> 27:11.405
Considering my ability,
I can't say I blame you.

27:11.473 --> 27:15.643
No one here is going to cheer you
on. Quite the opposite, I imagine.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.645
I've arranged my own supporters.

27:17.713 --> 27:21.850
Paid for, out of your very
own little salary, I imagine,

27:21.884 --> 27:24.352
working woman that you are.

27:24.386 --> 27:26.786
Who allowed that rabble in here?

27:26.821 --> 27:29.122
Emily.

27:29.157 --> 27:31.091
I hope

27:31.125 --> 27:33.260
I haven't missed anything.

27:33.294 --> 27:36.997
Hello there. Uh, George Crabtree.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.766
Um... how's the practice going?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.902
I'm very much looking
forward to the game tomorrow.

27:42.970 --> 27:47.006
That's a nice suit. From
Timothy Eaton's, is it?

27:47.040 --> 27:50.776
My Aunt Begonia, actually.
She's an excellent seamstress.

27:50.810 --> 27:52.278
Homemade!

27:52.312 --> 27:54.947
How quaint. I must say,

27:54.982 --> 27:57.548
Emily, he's so very perfect for you.

27:57.583 --> 28:00.151
A match made in middleclass.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.826
Well, Dr. Grace,

28:08.861 --> 28:11.930
this place is exactly how I imagined.

28:17.735 --> 28:21.338
I know you're nervous, but I think you'll
swing circles around this Eustacia Stokes.

28:21.373 --> 28:23.340
In fact, I'm quite looking
forward to watching you beat her.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.542
George, I think it might
be best if you don't...

28:25.576 --> 28:27.411
If I don't what?

28:27.445 --> 28:29.979
Nothing.

28:30.014 --> 28:34.583
If you don't want me to
come, Emily, just say.

28:34.651 --> 28:36.519
It's all right. I understand.

28:36.586 --> 28:40.123
- George...
- It's fine. I take no of fence.

28:49.065 --> 28:51.833
Henry, watch what you're doing.
You're muddling up the evidence.

28:51.867 --> 28:54.169
What are you talking about?
This is Sophia Lucas' pen.

28:54.203 --> 28:56.604
No, that's Judith Winslow's pen.

28:56.639 --> 28:59.007
Well, then it's Ethel Morgan...

28:59.042 --> 29:02.209
See, George?

29:02.277 --> 29:04.578
It's Sophia Lucas' pen.

29:04.612 --> 29:07.614
All three girls with the same pen.

29:07.682 --> 29:10.284
Good work, Henry. Come with me.

29:12.019 --> 29:13.525
That Kane Mueller from the stationery store 

29:13.526 --> 29:16.623
has something to do with
Sophia Lucas' disappearance.

29:16.691 --> 29:19.859
This is where he lives.
She's in there. I know it.

29:22.696 --> 29:24.297
George.

29:28.269 --> 29:29.902
That's him.

29:32.539 --> 29:35.740
Henry, I'll wait here. You fetch
Detective Murdoch immediately.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.815
- Thank you, officer.
- You're welcome.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.650
Sir!

29:45.718 --> 29:47.953
We've found Sophia Lucas!

29:48.021 --> 29:50.821
Lads.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.599
- You can't come in here.
- Get out of the way.

30:01.666 --> 30:04.002
No, hey, no, wait!

30:04.036 --> 30:06.736
Go this way.

30:06.804 --> 30:10.240
Miss Lucas! Miss Lucas!

30:14.712 --> 30:17.481
This one's clear!

30:21.051 --> 30:22.985
Check the other end of the hallway.

30:25.889 --> 30:28.924
- He's going to kill me next.
- Who?

30:28.958 --> 30:31.394
Professor Bahmanyar.

30:37.225 --> 30:39.191
Where is Kane?

30:39.226 --> 30:42.061
Mr. Mueller is in holding
until we get some answers.

30:42.095 --> 30:44.731
He has nothing to do with
this. He's just a friend.

30:44.765 --> 30:46.899
I asked him to hide me.

30:46.933 --> 30:51.838
Miss Lucas, please tell me, why is it you
think Professor Bahmanyar is trying to kill you?

30:56.609 --> 30:59.745
Miss Lucas, I know about
the Adelphean Society.

30:59.746 --> 31:01.813
I know about Amelia Richards.

31:01.816 --> 31:05.751
- Oh, you know?
- Mm.

31:05.895 --> 31:07.997
It was all a terrible mistake.

31:08.031 --> 31:10.966
Judith and her rituals.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.035
She wanted us to be like the Freemasons.

31:14.069 --> 31:16.537
Then she found out about
Amelia and that foreigner...

31:16.571 --> 31:18.906
Professor Bahmanyar.

31:18.940 --> 31:22.510
We were all disgusted, but
Judith was really angry.

31:22.544 --> 31:24.512
She said that Amelia was
jeopardizing everything

31:24.546 --> 31:27.147
that women students had fought so hard for.

31:27.181 --> 31:29.682
Not only would the dalliance
have led to her expulsion,

31:29.717 --> 31:32.319
but she would have disgraced her family

31:32.353 --> 31:35.655
and us. Tell me about
the night Amelia died.

31:35.689 --> 31:38.658
We wore white robes.

31:39.992 --> 31:42.329
We'd never dressed for a ritual before.

31:44.964 --> 31:47.933
We went to the lake.

31:52.305 --> 31:54.206
We dunked her underwater

31:54.241 --> 31:56.575
six times... 

31:57.519 --> 32:01.746
one for every month she
was involved with him.

32:02.780 --> 32:05.850
The sixth time she went underwater,
she stopped breathing altogether.

32:12.063 --> 32:15.698
We didn't know what to do.

32:15.732 --> 32:18.033
But it was ruled a suicide.

32:18.068 --> 32:21.170
No one asked any
questions. No one else knew.

32:21.205 --> 32:23.005
Only the four of us.

32:23.073 --> 32:26.509
He must have discovered what we'd done.

32:26.543 --> 32:29.112
Now they're all dead, all but me.

32:32.748 --> 32:34.682
May I go now?

32:34.717 --> 32:36.818
No.

32:36.852 --> 32:40.388
No, you most certainly may not go.

32:43.993 --> 32:46.928
What do you mean, I killed
three girls? I did no such thing.

32:46.962 --> 32:50.063
- I didn't even know two of them.
- We know you drowned those girls,

32:50.098 --> 32:52.366
the same way they drowned Amelia Richards.

32:52.434 --> 32:54.635
Amelia? What do you mean?

32:54.669 --> 32:57.204
Her friends learned of your affair,

32:57.272 --> 32:59.540
and her friends wanted to put an end it,

32:59.608 --> 33:01.308
so they "purified" her

33:01.376 --> 33:03.676
by repeatedly immersing
her head underwater.

33:03.744 --> 33:05.811
- But her weak lungs.
- Exactly.

33:05.879 --> 33:08.381
They killed her, you killed them.

33:08.415 --> 33:13.286
Amelia... murdered. All this time.

33:13.354 --> 33:17.223
- Yes.
- So she did not kill herself?

33:17.291 --> 33:20.292
No.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.762
Thank you, Detective.

33:25.698 --> 33:27.799
Thank you.

33:30.170 --> 33:32.771
Gentlemen, I believe he was sincere.

33:32.838 --> 33:35.806
He genuinely did not know the
truth about Miss Richards' death.

33:35.840 --> 33:39.143
Excuse me, Doctor, but I think
you've been taken in somewhat.

33:39.178 --> 33:41.679
I watched the emotions on his face.

33:41.746 --> 33:45.416
Only a very calculating person would be
able to control himself so convincingly.

33:45.450 --> 33:48.219
And there's been no other indicators.

33:48.253 --> 33:52.088
And yet, Bahmanyar is the only person
with any sort of motive whatsoever.

33:52.122 --> 33:55.727
I'll agree the murders seem
to be motivated by revenge,

33:55.728 --> 33:57.545
but perhaps not Bahmanyar's.

33:57.547 --> 33:59.663
How about the lad who
works in the pen shop?

33:59.697 --> 34:02.765
No, I believe it was someone

34:02.800 --> 34:05.768
who knew what really
happened to Amelia Richards.

34:05.803 --> 34:09.605
But other than Sophia Lucas, they're
all dead. Do you have the statement?

34:09.639 --> 34:11.273
Yes, sir.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.511
"We dressed in white robes."

34:16.545 --> 34:19.514
Took themselves very
seriously, didn't they?

34:19.547 --> 34:22.016
Hilda Gregson mentioned white robes.

34:22.050 --> 34:25.119
I believe she did. But how
would she have known that?

34:46.572 --> 34:49.041
Because she was there.

34:49.074 --> 34:52.043
Miss Gregson, you're aware of
what happened to Amelia Richards?

34:52.078 --> 34:53.812
She committed suicide.

34:53.847 --> 34:57.149
The truth... that she was
drowned and left for dead.

34:57.183 --> 34:59.452
You're also aware that three
of the women that participated

34:59.486 --> 35:01.454
in that ritual are now also dead.

35:01.521 --> 35:02.987
Drowned.

35:03.021 --> 35:05.823
You witnessed the event,
perhaps even sanctioned it.

35:05.858 --> 35:07.992
I had nothing to do with it.

35:08.026 --> 35:11.263
Where were you the past three
nights between 6 and 8pm?

35:11.297 --> 35:12.764
Here.

35:12.831 --> 35:15.900
Studying. With any number of witnesses.

35:15.968 --> 35:18.169
I didn't kill anyone.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.671
I didn't kill Amelia.

35:20.739 --> 35:22.306
No,

35:22.340 --> 35:25.743
but you watched her die and did nothing.

35:27.712 --> 35:29.179
What could I do?

35:29.213 --> 35:30.947
I couldn't tell anyone.

35:30.982 --> 35:33.183
No one would believe me.

35:33.251 --> 35:34.950
Hilda.

35:34.985 --> 35:36.919
Are you all right?

35:39.356 --> 35:43.259
So, Alvin Storey is Hilda
Gregson's half-brother.

35:43.327 --> 35:45.928
And you think he knows
about Amelia Richards' death?

35:45.996 --> 35:49.198
Yes, sir. And I believe my
first instinct was right.

35:49.232 --> 35:53.268
Judith Winslow was on to something. George!

35:53.303 --> 35:55.804
Sir?

35:55.871 --> 35:58.807
Before her death, Judith Winslow visited

35:58.841 --> 36:01.443
her aunt's cottage in
Kleinburg. Maple Cottage.

36:01.477 --> 36:03.945
Perhaps she left some notes
there for safe keeping.

36:04.013 --> 36:06.947
- Crabtree, you're on the next train.
- Sir.

36:07.015 --> 36:09.997
So, you think Storey
wanted Miss Winslow dead.

36:11.008 --> 36:12.152
But then, why the other girls?

36:12.754 --> 36:15.690
Well, sir, perhaps he killed the
other girls to throw us off the track,

36:15.724 --> 36:17.706
thinking that we would
link the other deaths

36:17.707 --> 36:20.345
to the first murder
and Professor Bahmanyar.

36:20.562 --> 36:22.895
That would make him a right evil bastard.

36:22.963 --> 36:25.865
I'd be inclined to agree with you, sir.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.867
And you don't know where George is?

36:27.935 --> 36:29.902
He said he was off to Kleinburg.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.871
- Today?
- Mm-hmm.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.941
But that means he'll miss my croquet game.

36:34.975 --> 36:38.144
Well, I could watch
your game, if you'd like.

36:38.212 --> 36:42.214
Uh, that's quite all
right, Constable Higgins.

36:42.281 --> 36:44.550
Of course.

36:52.726 --> 36:56.394
Have a look at these women.
Do you recognize them?

36:56.862 --> 36:58.893
And, uh, this.

37:00.129 --> 37:01.758
Except there's one piece missing.

37:02.659 --> 37:04.451
I wonder who that was meant for.

37:05.566 --> 37:08.234
Her?

37:08.268 --> 37:10.236
I don't know these girls.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.170
You should.

37:12.204 --> 37:15.707
They were all part of the
Adelphean society with your sister.

37:15.742 --> 37:17.442
If you say so.

37:17.510 --> 37:19.645
As was Amelia Richards.

37:19.712 --> 37:21.747
I know what happened to her.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.683
My sister wasn't involved with that.

37:24.717 --> 37:28.719
No, but she knew the truth,
as did your secretary,

37:28.754 --> 37:31.055
Judith Winslow. Because you knew

37:31.089 --> 37:33.390
Judith Winslow had killed Amelia Richards,

37:33.425 --> 37:35.626
you knew you had something
you could use against her.

37:35.661 --> 37:39.463
Use against? She was a secretary.

37:39.497 --> 37:41.599
A secretary trying to become a journalist.

37:41.633 --> 37:45.068
And like any good journalist,
she had found out something...

37:45.102 --> 37:48.972
something that could destroy you.

37:49.006 --> 37:51.541
Tell me about Maple Cottage.

37:51.576 --> 37:54.477
You keep them out of this.

37:54.511 --> 37:56.746
I'm afraid I can't do that.

37:56.781 --> 38:00.248
George.

38:03.519 --> 38:05.788
Hello. Thank you for coming in.

38:05.822 --> 38:09.625
Could you please identify this man?

38:09.659 --> 38:12.227
It's all right. You can tell him.

38:12.261 --> 38:14.629
He is my husband.

38:14.663 --> 38:17.932
I see. Thank you.

38:17.967 --> 38:20.501
But there's no record of your marriage.

38:20.535 --> 38:24.238
We may not have been married in a church,

38:24.272 --> 38:26.273
but we are married all the same.

38:26.308 --> 38:29.577
And Judith Winslow had found out the truth.

38:29.645 --> 38:31.979
I don't know what you mean.

38:32.046 --> 38:34.147
You don't have a shred of evidence.

38:34.215 --> 38:36.249
Ah, yes.

38:39.821 --> 38:42.623
We found this in your home.

38:45.326 --> 38:47.793
I know your secret.

38:47.828 --> 38:50.830
Judith knew about my wife.

38:50.864 --> 38:53.666
She was going to write a story about it.

38:53.734 --> 38:56.969
She said I was a disgrace

38:57.037 --> 39:01.140
and that my wife was a... a "dirty Indian".

39:01.267 --> 39:06.437
I told her I would tell everyone
what she did to Miss Richards.

39:06.505 --> 39:08.272
But she laughed at me,

39:08.307 --> 39:12.343
told me no one would believe
it. I couldn't contain myself.

39:12.377 --> 39:15.714
I grabbed her to shake some sense into her,

39:15.748 --> 39:18.849
but she stepped backwards and hit her head.

39:20.785 --> 39:23.120
I took her to the lake and threw her in,

39:23.188 --> 39:25.655
thinking it would look like she drowned.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.293
And what about the other two women?

39:30.361 --> 39:32.896
I had to make it look like
someone else killed her.

39:32.964 --> 39:36.833
By pointing the evidence
at Professor Bahmanyar?

39:36.900 --> 39:39.736
If people had found out about Marianne,

39:39.803 --> 39:41.871
it would have destroyed me.

39:41.939 --> 39:44.406
It would have destroyed my children.

39:44.474 --> 39:48.111
I would have lost everything!

39:48.178 --> 39:52.080
Damn it, man, I was protecting my family.

39:52.115 --> 39:55.150
Any man would do the same.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.086
I don't think that they would.

39:58.154 --> 40:01.189
I'm going to see that you hang for this.

40:07.428 --> 40:10.064
Professor? You've been dismissed?

40:10.098 --> 40:12.532
Affairs with students are forbidden.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.902
I'm being made an example of.

40:14.936 --> 40:18.072
Oh, I see. Where will you go?

40:18.106 --> 40:21.842
Perhaps Australia. They don't
mind an indiscretion or two.

40:23.778 --> 40:26.179
- I wish you luck.
- Thank you, Detective.

40:26.213 --> 40:30.016
Thank you for setting my heavy heart free.

40:36.955 --> 40:40.533
I spoke to my solicitor. Mr.
Storey's assets will go to his sister.

40:40.540 --> 40:44.327
She refuses to acknowledge the new family.

40:44.362 --> 40:48.298
He intends to marry her
legally before his trial.

40:48.332 --> 40:50.734
At least then the children
will be taken care of.

40:50.768 --> 40:53.703
I suppose that's something.

41:01.076 --> 41:04.445
- Emily, we have to begin.
- Just another few minutes.

41:04.480 --> 41:07.948
Obviously your man-for-hire
found a better job.

41:07.983 --> 41:10.456
Or have you finally
realized you're outclassed...

41:10.457 --> 41:11.457
in every sense?

41:12.154 --> 41:15.122
Look, we have to start now or you forfeit.

41:15.157 --> 41:18.858
Emily! I'm sorry, I was detained.

41:18.893 --> 41:21.495
- Police duty.
- Good Lord. A constable.

41:21.529 --> 41:23.597
Even worse than I thought.

41:23.631 --> 41:26.500
Thank you for coming, George.

41:26.534 --> 41:29.569
- I wouldn't have missed it.
- Shall we?

41:32.706 --> 41:34.973
Well done, well done, well done!

41:35.008 --> 41:38.043
Excellent shot, miss. Dr. Grace,

41:38.077 --> 41:40.846
it looks like you have
your work cut out for you.

41:44.017 --> 41:47.553
Well, it looks like the
game really and truly is on.

41:51.156 --> 41:54.392
Hey! Excellent!

41:54.427 --> 41:57.495
Well done.

42:07.339 --> 42:09.873
Hey! Oh-ho-ho!

42:16.180 --> 42:18.915
Ahchoo!

42:18.950 --> 42:22.885
- Dreadfully sorry.
- That's not very sporting, man.

42:22.953 --> 42:26.789
- Are you going to arrest me, Constable?
- I should thank you, Ralph.

42:26.857 --> 42:29.359
Your sneeze put me in
an excellent position.

42:29.426 --> 42:31.861
I suppose I should start saving my pennies

42:31.928 --> 42:34.163
- for the Gallerie Colbert.
- Yes.

42:34.231 --> 42:37.632
Perhaps they are looking for a
shop girl and a security guard.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.668
I can just imagine the papers.

42:39.736 --> 42:43.472
"Lady doctor and her pet
constable take the gutters

42:43.506 --> 42:46.040
- of Paris by storm."
- Ugh!

42:46.108 --> 42:47.942
Oh!

42:48.010 --> 42:50.144
Oh! I'm so sorry. How
dreadfully clumsy of me.

42:50.212 --> 42:52.280
Oh, my foot. It's broken.

42:52.348 --> 42:53.772
- It's broken!
- Oh, it is not.

42:53.773 --> 42:54.773
Ralph!

42:55.550 --> 42:58.085
Uh... look, I'm sorry, Dr. Grace,

42:58.152 --> 43:00.320
but I have no choice but to disqualify you

43:00.355 --> 43:02.289
and ask you to leave
the premises immediately.

43:02.357 --> 43:03.724
Dr. Grace was about to win the competition!

43:03.759 --> 43:05.292
Assaulting one's opponent is

43:05.360 --> 43:08.328
hardly the action of an Olympian!

43:08.396 --> 43:10.697
Emily, you were about to win.

43:10.731 --> 43:13.600
- Of course I was.
- So, what,

43:13.667 --> 43:15.735
you... threw away Paris for me?

43:15.803 --> 43:20.172
Oh, don't go getting a swelled
head over it, George Crabtree.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.475
Good crack!
