And in that time,

- Why?

12:10.230 --> 12:13.198
Yes, and I found out.

12:14.967 --> 12:18.203
But you're not gonna tell.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.271
That hardly seems fair.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.973
Fair?

12:23.943 --> 12:26.878
You look different
than I remembered, Alan.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.948
Well, that's not surprising.
We met only once.

12:29.950 --> 12:30.882
True.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.618
Go on.
How do I look different?

12:33.620 --> 12:36.020
You're very suave, elegant.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.823
Well, I try to be.
It's a pose.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.826
Yes, I remembered that much.

12:41.828 --> 12:48.500
But I think in my memory,
I made you somehow ominous.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.535
- And now?
- You seem ordinary.

12:50.537 --> 12:55.340
- A life's work down the drain.
- Just like anyone I might meet.

12:55.342 --> 12:59.010
I mean, you're still you.
You're still Alan, but...

12:59.012 --> 13:01.045
- Go on.
- Well, to look at you,

13:01.047 --> 13:04.682
you'd never guess
what you're capable of.

13:06.752 --> 13:09.154
So I'm confused.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.991
For two people

13:12.993 --> 13:15.894

Your college is nearby, right?

13:17.731 --> 13:19.164
Just outside Philly.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.100
So I would have thought,
under the circumstances--

13:22.102 --> 13:24.035
I was afraid.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.872

Am I being too personal?

I don't know.
I don't really know you,

13:36.583 --> 13:38.917

if I can trust you.

- About you?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.121
Sure. If this is
a game of trust,

13:43.123 --> 13:45.690
then I should really
go first, right?

13:45.692 --> 13:48.993
Go on.
What have you got to lose?

13:51.530 --> 13:53.565
He's very provocative.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.569
Yes. Do you want
to ask him a question?

13:57.571 --> 14:00.171
I don't know what to ask.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.207
I really love my uncle.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.777
I had hoped when I saw him
again, he'd be...

14:05.779 --> 14:07.078
well, like this.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.180
But it's even better
than my fantasy.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.349
That's you, kid.
You got it.

14:11.351 --> 14:15.119
Your father's brains,
intuition, spirit.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.255
- His looks?
- Oh, God, no.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.991
Oh, your mother,
you got her eyes,

14:19.993 --> 14:22.160
her coloring, her bod.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.362
- Hey!
- Don't you think?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.964
I think.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.800
You knew my mother?

14:29.969 --> 14:32.337
Gregory took us all out
to dinner.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.540
Some frou-frou French joint.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.841
Really?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.377
Yeah. They irritated me.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.846
No! Why?

14:41.848 --> 14:44.916
They seemed so young
and perfect.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.986
And they flirted
with each other.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.187
And they talked to each other.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.289
Well, one talked
and the other listened.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.158
And then the second one talked,
and the first one listened.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.594
It was a very unconventional
marriage.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.663
Yeah, they were pretty great.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.064
They were pretty hot, too.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.667
- No!
- They'd have these sex bouts.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.002
No! Eww!

15:04.004 --> 15:05.470
Before you were born,

15:05.472 --> 15:07.839
your mother would
wear your father out.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.575
- Gregory!
- She'd tease him about it.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.345
About how she'd have to take
another lover or two or three.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.381
But it was mostly in fun,
of course.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.815
Of course.

15:17.817 --> 15:21.452
I should think so.
Nobody has affairs in Ohio.

15:23.889 --> 15:27.225
Not where we lived.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.495
So you were just an
old-fashioned American family.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.197
Well, that's the virtue
of the provinces right there.

15:33.199 --> 15:33.998
Provinces?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.367
You know, Ohio, the Midwest.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.704
Here in the city, marriage
exists primarily for sport.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.439
Sport? What sport?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.441
Well, after a while...

15:43.443 --> 15:45.810
You're way too young
to feel this,

15:45.812 --> 15:49.681
but it gets boring sleeping
around when you're single.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.249
- Says you.
- It does.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.052
Society sanctions it.
It's on the cover of magazines.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.287
The thrill is gone.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.623
But...

15:58.625 --> 16:00.758
adultery?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.927
Sneaking behind someone's back?

16:02.929 --> 16:05.964
Stolen moments with
the babysitter or a stewardess

16:05.966 --> 16:09.200
or the wife of some
business competitor?

16:09.202 --> 16:12.003
- That's exciting. That's hot.
- That sounds sick.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.473
Sure, it's a little sick,
but we need excitement.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.043
We need the element of risk
in order to feel alive.

16:19.045 --> 16:21.446
Some people race cars.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.082
Some people parachute
out of planes.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.817
And some people just fuck.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.151
And you?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.386
Attagirl!

16:29.755 --> 16:31.522
Are you married?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.926
Where's your wife?

16:34.928 --> 16:36.661
In Jersey.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.129
And you're here?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.865
I told you. I stay here
a few nights a week on business.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.601
- Funny business?
- It's happened.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.070
- Often?
- Oh, God.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.072
I thought I could
ask you anything.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.508
- You can.
- You're being evasive.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.545
No, I'm just trying to phrase
my answers in a provocative way.

16:54.547 --> 17:00.218
So what does your wife think
about this loft and so on?

17:01.453 --> 17:02.987
She doesn't think.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.323
She has her house.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.727
That's it?

17:09.729 --> 17:12.997
She also has our children.

17:12.999 --> 17:15.433
Three lovely girls.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.101
Spoiled beyond belief.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.469
She swims in the pool.

17:18.471 --> 17:22.006
She screws the gardener,
some low-class trash.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.611
All-in-all, it's a very
satisfactory marriage

17:26.613 --> 17:28.546
by New York standards.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.382
Of course, it's not
what your parents had,

17:31.384 --> 17:34.085
but what they had
wasn't really...

17:34.087 --> 17:36.187
Wasn't what?

17:36.189 --> 17:39.023
Wasn't suitable to my nature.

17:39.025 --> 17:42.260
What's really different
from my memory...

17:42.262 --> 17:46.330
I mean, I knew if things went
as far as they did,

17:46.332 --> 17:48.332
that I must have had
some part in it.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.068
Something coming
from me to you.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.270
- A flirtation at least.
- At least, yeah.

17:52.272 --> 17:55.006
And I knew
if I had been flirting,

17:55.008 --> 17:57.008
you must have been attractive.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.544
Despite the ominous quality.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.414
Yes, so I made you attractive
in my memory.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.883
Well, thanks,
I appreciate the gesture.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.619
Yes, I made you handsome.

18:08.621 --> 18:12.457
What I realize now is
you are handsome.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.624
Why, thank you.

18:13.626 --> 18:17.028
Oh, not a compliment.
Just an observation.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.097
That's why when you
walked in tonight,

18:19.099 --> 18:22.266
- I thought something complex.
- Yes.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.403
A strange combination
of attraction and repulsion.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.773
I think that's called
sexual energy.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.475
Is it?

18:30.477 --> 18:32.643
[door buzzer]

18:34.980 --> 18:36.948
Who is that?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.817
Hello?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.586
<i>It's your uncle, kid.</i>

18:41.588 --> 18:43.154
Gregory's coming?

18:43.156 --> 18:44.355
Wasn't that the plan?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.390
I cook for the three of us?

18:46.392 --> 18:49.293
Yeah, but that was not
what I...

18:49.295 --> 18:50.461
But what?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.630
Well, I was bewildered
by your invitation.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.634
But after what happened
last year, I just...

18:56.636 --> 18:58.269
Go on, please.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.304
Well, I just thought that--

19:00.306 --> 19:02.340
And frankly,
your behavior tonight

19:02.342 --> 19:04.375
would seem
to justify my expectation.

19:04.377 --> 19:08.713
I thought there might be some
romantic element to the evening.

19:08.715 --> 19:13.985
You know, a continuation
of our previous meeting.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.521
Hmm.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.922
Do you have a boyfriend?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.924
I did for two years.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.692
And?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.761
He was very nice.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.530
That's a kiss of death.

19:25.532 --> 19:29.901
Well, yes, actually,
in this case.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.669
I was a scrawny nerd
in high school,

19:31.671 --> 19:34.705
so Sam was really my first...

19:34.707 --> 19:37.341
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.743
[laughs]

19:38.745 --> 19:41.279
That's a talent Alan has,
you know?

19:41.281 --> 19:44.415
He draws people out,
and then he collects 'em.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.151
I don't want to be collected.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.453
Gregory's being unfair.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.489
I told you
I have no secrets.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.491
That's Alan's secret, okay?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.793
He tells you what he had
for breakfast, right?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.462
Then you tell him
who you screwed for lunch.

19:58.464 --> 20:02.166
And what does he do with
these secrets afterwards?

20:04.069 --> 20:06.070
That doesn't sound very nice.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.005
It's not, Manya.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.208
It's not a nice city.
It's not a nice world.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.310
One has to put on armor.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.312
This is what you meant,
isn't it,

20:14.314 --> 20:16.614
about New York,
walking the streets?

20:16.616 --> 20:18.182
What? What did he say?

20:18.184 --> 20:21.953
To keep safe,
don't look straight ahead.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.889
Always out of
the corner of your eye.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.390
That's very good.

20:36.668 --> 20:39.003
My boyfriend--

20:39.005 --> 20:40.638
I'm very monogamous.

20:40.640 --> 20:46.310
And, well, sex can be pretty
scary, right? Intense?

20:46.312 --> 20:48.045
Yeah, it can be, yeah.

20:48.047 --> 20:52.650
And I wasn't scared with him,
so I thought I loved him.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.353
I mean, that's how
it's supposed to be, right?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.655
The two go together?
Sex and love?

20:57.657 --> 21:01.058
Not really, no.
I mean, in my experience.

21:01.060 --> 21:03.261
Well, then Sam asked me
to marry him.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.730
I got all excited like...

21:05.732 --> 21:08.633
started losing things...
forgetting to go to class,

21:08.635 --> 21:11.969
stubbing my toe
and cutting my finger.

21:11.971 --> 21:15.539
I realized I'm hurting myself.
I don't love him at all.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.844
Not the way my parents felt.
He was just first.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.512
So you broke up.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.849
- Six weeks ago.
- Smart move.

21:24.851 --> 21:30.821
And since then,
have you, uh...

21:30.823 --> 21:32.823
gained more experience?

21:32.825 --> 21:35.726
That is none of your business.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.561
Just curious.

21:40.198 --> 21:43.567
The answer to your question...

21:45.203 --> 21:48.506
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.645
Your answer is no.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.548
Well, you're very brave
to say it.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.484
Oh, thank you.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.620
I told you,
people tell him everything.

22:02.622 --> 22:06.324
Yes, well, he promises something
in return, doesn't he?

22:06.326 --> 22:09.760
- And what do I promise?
- I'm not sure.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.163
I guess I'll find out
when it gets here.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.532
Right, and how will you
recognize it?

22:14.534 --> 22:17.735
I'll be looking
straight ahead,

22:17.737 --> 22:20.504
and I'll see it out of
the corner of my eye.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.840
Gregory really is making
a New Yorker of you

22:22.842 --> 22:24.475
in, what, like three days?

22:24.477 --> 22:27.645
In three days!
Staten Island Ferry at midnight.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.981
Excuse me? Thanksgiving dinner
at the Four Seasons.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.584
Bar hopping in SoHo.
Oh! Oh!

22:33.586 --> 22:37.054
And then we went to this
illegal blackjack parlor

22:37.056 --> 22:38.456
on the Upper East Side!

22:38.458 --> 22:40.958
- She won!
- $80!

22:40.960 --> 22:43.361
- And you?
- $600!

22:43.363 --> 22:45.863
- You won?
- I lost!

22:47.499 --> 22:48.833
And then last night--

22:48.835 --> 22:50.701
Now this was the highlight
of the visit.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.304
No, until tonight!
Every night gets better.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.739
She cooked me a feast.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.274
She can cook, too?
This is excessive.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.676
Yeah, you figure
a college kid,

22:58.678 --> 23:00.311
she's gonna open up
a few soup cans.

23:00.313 --> 23:01.946
My mother taught me.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.781
Mozzarella marinara!

23:03.783 --> 23:08.185
And then green salad with pears
and hot goat cheese dressing.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.454
- Wow.
- And veal sorrentino.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.324
My mouth is watering.
I adore Italian food.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.226
Oh, then sometime
I'll cook for you.

23:15.228 --> 23:18.195
Really? How about tomorrow?

23:18.197 --> 23:20.498
- Tonight.
- [laughs]

23:20.500 --> 23:23.100
- I have to go back to school.
- Oh, no.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.636
Yeah, but you'll be back for
Christmas, right? Your birthday?

23:25.638 --> 23:27.838
Well, if you can stand me again.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.939
She's comin' back.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.908
It's settled then.
Christmas Eve.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.143
You're on!

23:32.145 --> 23:34.945
Jesus, it's an ice rink
out there.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.680
So I've heard.

23:36.682 --> 23:40.284
I'm slippin', I'm slidin'.
Twice I fell on my tush.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.886
Must've been a nice,
soft landing.

23:41.888 --> 23:45.423
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.192
It's mutual.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.727
Oh, wow.

23:49.729 --> 23:53.431
How about a hug, a kiss,
a friendly greeting, huh?

23:53.433 --> 23:56.801
Yeah. Much better.
Yeah. You look sharp.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.068
Thank you.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.271
What do you say, douchebag?
She looks sharp, no?

24:00.273 --> 24:01.572
Very sharp.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.140
Yeah, she's a lousy niece,
though.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.844
Has no respect for family,
a person's feelings.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.913
All right, Gregory,
what did I do?

24:08.915 --> 24:11.081
No, no, no.
Question is what did I do?

24:11.083 --> 24:14.485
You know, I show you New York.
You know, high spots, low spots.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.987
You know, we start to feel
like family, right?

24:16.989 --> 24:19.089
Then you go off to school,
and I don't hear from you.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.493
- I told you I was busy.
- Yeah, yeah. Some big romance.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.628
So you get a new boyfriend.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.630
Doesn't mean you desert
your family, does it?

24:26.632 --> 24:29.200
And then you move here,
and you don't tell me.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.568
I don't know where you are.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.571
Now you know.
Now you're here.

24:33.573 --> 24:34.872
You're a lucky man.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.073
I know.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.677
I'm the lucky one
to have such an uncle.

24:39.679 --> 24:43.614
Then why'd you stay away
so long?

24:43.616 --> 24:46.450
You said you were afraid
for three years?

24:46.452 --> 24:48.118
- Not afraid of him.
- No.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.288
We'd talk on the phone,
but she wouldn't visit.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.157
But telephone's different.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.793
I mean, God may be perverse,

24:55.795 --> 25:00.531
but he won't kill someone,
you know,

25:00.533 --> 25:04.568
just 'cause you talk to him
on the phone.

25:06.137 --> 25:08.539
Oh, I see.

25:09.908 --> 25:13.277
You're afraid of losing
those you love, so...

25:13.279 --> 25:15.212
you don't love anybody?

25:15.214 --> 25:18.382
Something like that.

25:18.384 --> 25:21.585
It's amazing.

25:21.587 --> 25:24.722
You don't seem embittered
at all.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.458
Time helps.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.026
And Sam did.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.530
There are still scars.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.399
But...

25:35.401 --> 25:38.068
you can't see 'em anymore.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.207
I have to pee.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.877
Oh. Down the hall
to your left.

25:52.584 --> 25:56.587
- Feel free to look around.
- Don't worry, I will.

25:59.124 --> 26:02.126
- Can I ask you one question?
- Of course.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.761
Was it you got scared again?

26:08.133 --> 26:09.466
Scared?

26:09.468 --> 26:10.901
Well, you said
you wouldn't come see me

26:10.903 --> 26:12.703
'cause of what happened
to your folks.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.638
You know, so I thought maybe--

26:14.640 --> 26:16.507
And that's why I didn't
press you about it.

26:16.509 --> 26:20.210
I figured maybe even though
we had such a good time

26:20.212 --> 26:21.912
that maybe you got scared again.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.183
I was not scared.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.285
Well, good.

26:28.287 --> 26:31.922
- Have a martini.
- Thank you.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.425
- She's trying to get us drunk.
- No.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.194
Just trying to lubricate
the social situation.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.596
Alcohol does that, no?

26:38.598 --> 26:40.297
- Alcohol does a lot of things.
- I know.

26:40.299 --> 26:45.402
It lowers one's defenses,
lowers one's resistance.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.437
Drink up.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.739
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.514
Good. Warms me up.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.617
So how are you, Alan?

26:59.619 --> 27:04.488
Oh, weary, excited, intrigued.

27:04.490 --> 27:06.724
Never better.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.660
So tell me about
this big romance,

27:09.662 --> 27:12.196
the one that kept you from
visiting Christmas vacation,

27:12.198 --> 27:14.064
spring vacation.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.166
It ended badly.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.735
You know how these things go.

27:17.737 --> 27:21.071
Relationships can get
pretty messy.

27:21.073 --> 27:24.174
- Should we tell him?
- Tell him what?

27:24.176 --> 27:25.776
You know.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.676
She's my niece.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.854
Gregory, I just...

28:12.557 --> 28:14.558
I just want to talk to her.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.795
There, back in the bedroom?

28:17.797 --> 28:19.797
Cameras.

28:19.799 --> 28:20.998
Yeah?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.868
What, you make sex tapes here
or something?

28:24.870 --> 28:28.472
No, I told you I rent the
apartment a few times a month.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.940
And people use it to--

28:29.942 --> 28:32.242
People do whatever they do,
right?

28:32.244 --> 28:35.245
Sometimes, as I said,
it's for events,

28:35.247 --> 28:39.049
business negotiations
and so on and such forth.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.419
Other times,

28:42.421 --> 28:44.421
I'm sure it's for pleasure.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.190
Oh.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.059
Yeah. That's why I have
that music box

28:49.061 --> 28:52.830
on the door downstairs,
instead of a key.

28:52.832 --> 28:56.133
Someone calls up,
needs a place to stay,

28:56.135 --> 28:59.203
I just tell 'em
what tune to play.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.972
"Mary Had a Little Lamb."

29:01.974 --> 29:03.207
Yes.

29:03.209 --> 29:06.310
You know, in Russian,
my name, it means Mary.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.479
Really?

29:08.481 --> 29:10.047
Let me ask you something.

29:10.049 --> 29:13.784
This apartment, the cameras,
renting it out,

29:13.786 --> 29:19.757
does that seem somehow
sordid to you?

29:19.759 --> 29:21.425
I see it in a different way.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.162
- I'm sure you do.
- I see this as a sanctuary.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.097
[scoffs]

29:27.099 --> 29:28.899
Come on.

29:30.869 --> 29:34.438
I see this as a place
where anything can happen.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.340
Where anything must happen.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.542
And after it's happened,
it's forgotten.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.377
Like Vegas.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.079
Just like Vegas.

29:42.081 --> 29:46.183
He brings blonde bimbos up here,
screws their brains out

29:46.185 --> 29:47.718
and doesn't feel guilty.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.753
Is that true?

29:49.755 --> 29:53.090
You like blonde bimbos?

29:53.092 --> 29:55.626
- With big boobs.
- Yes.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.128
- And they like him, too.
- Truth is...

29:58.130 --> 30:01.565
most people haven't the faintest
idea what they like.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.134
All they know is
they like to be liked.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.904
It sounds like you're
pretty indiscriminate.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.439
Oh, no.
He's very particular.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.476
He only chooses bimbo blondes.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.378
Yeah, thanks, Greg.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.046
I'm that rarity amongst men

30:16.048 --> 30:18.215
in that I genuinely
appreciate women.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.051
And what I like most about them
is their femininity.

30:21.053 --> 30:24.454
So many women today
disguise that.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.424
They cut their hair short,
dress like teenage boys.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.526
But why?

30:29.528 --> 30:31.195
Blondes are different.

30:31.197 --> 30:34.531
A girl says by choosing to
remain or becoming a blonde,

30:34.533 --> 30:38.569
she says she's not ashamed
of her femininity.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.437
She prizes it.

30:40.439 --> 30:43.373
And I prize it, too.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.575
Wow!

30:44.577 --> 30:47.611
That is like...

30:47.613 --> 30:51.281
totally full of shit.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.653
You think so?

30:58.089 --> 31:02.793
Do you record these sex bouts
with these bimbos?

31:02.795 --> 31:06.697
No. I'm a very private person.

31:06.699 --> 31:11.034
- He means secretive.
- I mean private.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.238
I told you,
what happens here is forgotten.

31:17.275 --> 31:21.678
It all seems...
seems a little sad to me.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.115
I'm sorry. Sad?

31:25.117 --> 31:26.683
Yeah.

31:26.685 --> 31:30.754
These blonde women,
your marriage.

31:33.024 --> 31:37.294
- It seems like you're lonely.
- [Gregory laughs]

31:39.831 --> 31:42.266
Why are you laughing?

31:42.268 --> 31:44.234
I don't know.

31:44.236 --> 31:48.005
It may sound lonely,
but it's not.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.373
Not now.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.109
Sometimes...

31:52.111 --> 31:58.081
when I imagine myself
growing old, living like this,

31:58.083 --> 32:01.385
I'm glad I'm rich.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.553
Yeah.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.389
Is that honest enough for you?

32:06.724 --> 32:09.559
You're a very interesting man.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.728
Thank you.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.733
- I'm gonna go.
- What?

32:16.735 --> 32:18.535
- Really?
- Just for a little while.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.638
- You'll be okay.
- Where are you going?

32:21.640 --> 32:25.142
Oh, um, uh, you know that girl
I was dancing with downstairs?

32:25.144 --> 32:26.910
- The redhead?
- Yeah.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.046
Is she like waiting for you
or something?

32:29.048 --> 32:30.881
No, I don't think so.
No, I'm just gonna go down,

32:30.883 --> 32:32.382
get her phone number,
whatever.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.785
That's fine. I have the key
to your apartment.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.153
No, I'll be back in an hour.

32:36.155 --> 32:39.723
Yeah, sure.
See you in the morning, Uncle.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.291
Are you gonna be okay?

32:41.293 --> 32:46.530
Yeah. Alan can call me a cab
or the doorman downstairs.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.511
[laughs]

33:07.352 --> 33:09.820
<i>[touch tones]</i>

33:09.822 --> 33:10.821
[door unlocks]

33:10.823 --> 33:12.789
Got it on the first try.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.525
Gregory?

33:15.527 --> 33:19.396
Alan, he...

33:19.398 --> 33:22.132
He slept with me.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.601
Yeah, yeah, I figured.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.370
You figured?

33:26.372 --> 33:29.272
Well, it seemed
like a possibility.

33:29.274 --> 33:33.343
Yeah. That's why I didn't
come back to New York.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.848
It freaked me out.

33:37.850 --> 33:40.617
Oh. I see.

33:40.619 --> 33:45.555
Now that's been said,
uh, hors d'oeuvres?

33:45.557 --> 33:49.860
So I hope you like it.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.162
Ooh, what is this?

33:52.164 --> 33:54.931
Puff pastry
with cream and herbs,

33:54.933 --> 33:56.933
a little sausage.

33:59.337 --> 34:02.039
Mmm!

34:02.041 --> 34:03.907
Oh, my God,
that is fabulous.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.009
Thank you.

34:06.011 --> 34:09.079
- Alan, how are you feeling?
- Terrific.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.449
I mean, are you more relaxed
than you were earlier?

34:12.451 --> 34:16.386
- Yes, definitely.
- I'm glad.

34:18.356 --> 34:20.757
Alone at last.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.391
Yeah.

34:25.830 --> 34:27.764
You want some more cognac?

34:27.766 --> 34:30.067
I'm fine, thanks.

34:30.069 --> 34:33.503
Hey, Alan, what do you do?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.272
- Do?
- For a living.

34:35.274 --> 34:38.608
Gregory was a little vague.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.677
Was he? Oh, uh...

34:40.679 --> 34:42.212
I'm a middleman.

34:42.214 --> 34:45.916
You know, I...
I arrange things.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.018
Oh.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.719
I don't know what that means.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.489
If somebody wants something
that's difficult to obtain,

34:52.491 --> 34:54.291
they call me.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.159
I buy it as cheaply as I can.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.895
I sell it for as much
as I can get away with.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.597
What do you buy and sell?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.566
Oh, just about anything.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.869
Anything? And anybody?

35:05.871 --> 35:07.370
Afraid so.

35:07.372 --> 35:09.539
For the right price,
everyone's for sale.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.275
- I don't believe that.
- A famous story.

35:12.277 --> 35:16.012
Bernard Shaw offered a girl
five pounds to sleep with him.

35:16.014 --> 35:18.348
She was incensed.
Very upset.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.851
"What do you think I am?"
That sort of thing.

35:20.853 --> 35:23.286
So he offered her
500,000 pounds,

35:23.288 --> 35:25.489
and the girl realized that
she's gonna be set for life.

35:25.491 --> 35:26.523
She agreed.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.525
"Good," Shaw says.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.694
"Then it's only
a matter of price."

35:30.696 --> 35:32.929
Sounds like you're a pimp.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.865
Everyone is.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.200
Either a pimp or a whore.

35:37.202 --> 35:39.202
A pimp gets the money.
A whore gets fucked.

35:39.204 --> 35:40.337
That's a choice.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.339
There's also the john.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.174
He pays and gets fucked both.

35:44.176 --> 35:47.511
What a pessimistic view
of the world.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.578
Not really.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.348
What if you meet someone
with principles?

35:51.350 --> 35:52.182
Oh.

35:52.184 --> 35:54.518
You approach them differently.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.119
With power.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.255
Everyone has a weak point.

35:58.257 --> 36:03.293
With practice, you learn to
find out exactly where it is.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.529
You sound very confident.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.998
Well, one way or another,
I get what I want.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.734
Always?

36:10.736 --> 36:13.870
Doesn't that get,

36:13.872 --> 36:15.805
I don't know, boring?

36:15.807 --> 36:18.141
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.178
That's why I'm always looking
for new challenges, new things.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.379
Switch it up, you know.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.215
- What about me?
- What about you?

36:25.217 --> 36:27.083
Could you buy me?

36:27.085 --> 36:29.286
I doubt it.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.355
So you'd have to use power.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.558
You want an honest answer?

36:34.560 --> 36:36.726
You afraid to give one?

36:36.728 --> 36:38.562
I like you, Manya.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.898
And I have no desire
to buy you or overpower you.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.634
Well, yeah, but if you did?

36:44.636 --> 36:48.038
Have such a desire?
There'd be no problem.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.406
Really?

36:49.408 --> 36:54.544
Like I say,
everybody has a weak point.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.079
You're only 19.

36:56.081 --> 37:00.450
Meaning I'm virtually
defenseless?

37:02.320 --> 37:03.853
Well...

37:03.855 --> 37:06.590
You're probably right.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.393
What about my uncle?

37:10.395 --> 37:14.264
Gregory?
He's an old friend.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.633
Yeah, but if you wanted
something from him,

37:16.635 --> 37:18.068
could you get it?

37:26.043 --> 37:28.044
I already own your uncle.

37:28.046 --> 37:30.280
Own him?

37:30.282 --> 37:32.582
He owes me a debt.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.185
For what?

37:35.187 --> 37:37.354
Something I did for him.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.858
You think of your uncle
as a good man, don't you?

37:41.860 --> 37:43.593
- Yes.
- And he is.

37:43.595 --> 37:47.163
- He's a good man.
- Despite...

37:47.165 --> 37:51.401
Despite what I'm about to tell
you, he's still a good man.

37:51.403 --> 37:56.139
So 10, 12 years ago, your uncle
has a business partner

37:56.141 --> 37:57.874
who's trying to squeeze him out.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.409
It was a nasty situation.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.946
This guy,
I don't remember his name,

38:02.948 --> 38:05.181
Freddy, Fritz,

38:05.183 --> 38:07.384
he fucked Gregory
with these legal papers,

38:07.386 --> 38:08.885
and your uncle was
gonna get nothing.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.520
Absolutely nothing.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.956
So I had the man's legs broken.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.291
What?

38:14.293 --> 38:17.327
I hired two guys
to break the man's legs.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.267
Oh.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.970
A week later,
Fritz, whatever his name is,

38:26.972 --> 38:30.573
he sells the business to Gregory
for quite a reasonable price.

38:30.575 --> 38:33.109
So that's why you own Gregory.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.611
I didn't charge him
anything for it.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.213
- It was a favor.
- Oh, I get it.

38:37.215 --> 38:40.417
So you're saying
everything Gregory has,

38:40.419 --> 38:42.986
the apartment on Fifth Avenue,
his Cadillac--

38:42.988 --> 38:45.322
He owes it all to me.

38:45.324 --> 38:48.925
Yes. We're...

38:48.927 --> 38:50.894
friends.

38:50.896 --> 38:54.831
I'm not sure I'd like
to be your friend.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.534
Well, you wouldn't want
to be my enemy, would you?

38:57.536 --> 38:58.635
Agreed.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.637
Besides, I thought
we were friends already.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.839
Aren't you gonna
make dinner for me?

39:03.908 --> 39:06.543
I guess.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.779
I just...
never had a friend

39:09.781 --> 39:12.649
who goes around breaking
people's legs before.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.784
- I didn't do it, Manya.
- Of course not!

39:14.786 --> 39:17.120
Don't wanna
get your hands dirty.

39:17.122 --> 39:21.791
And it's not something I do
very often, either.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.560
You know, this was just...

39:23.562 --> 39:26.262
It was just one of those things,
you know?

39:26.264 --> 39:28.932
But isn't this exactly
what you mean by power?

39:28.934 --> 39:31.067
Don't you have to be willing
at any moment

39:31.069 --> 39:32.869
to break a man's legs?

39:32.871 --> 39:35.071
To have them broken? Yes.

39:35.073 --> 39:39.209
Alan told me about
breaking that guy's legs.

39:39.211 --> 39:43.713
He told me that
the two of you are friends.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.649
You owe him.

39:46.651 --> 39:50.887
Owe a debt you can
never really repay.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.191
Alan raped me, Gregory.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.360
- What do you mean, last year?
- Yes.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.529
That night?
Is that true?

39:59.531 --> 40:01.064
If that's how
she wants to see it.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.265
How do you see it?

40:02.267 --> 40:04.200
With my own eyes.

40:05.536 --> 40:10.240
She wanted it.
And I gave her what she wanted.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.275
Really?

40:12.277 --> 40:15.578
You serviced me, is that it?

40:15.580 --> 40:16.813
Yes.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.818
You wanted sex.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.220
And you know in your heart
of hearts all I did was fulfill

40:24.222 --> 40:26.923
a certain imperative.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.125
One both of us created.

40:29.127 --> 40:33.062
That's a lie,
and you know it.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.665
But, Gregory, she's not
telling you the whole story.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.801
- I'm not?
- No, no, you're not.

40:37.803 --> 40:42.405
It's a little more complex
than she suggests.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.474
Yes, that's true.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.943
For instance, she kissed me.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.011
When?

40:48.013 --> 40:49.546
Tonight before you arrived.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.448
Kissed me on the lips.

40:51.450 --> 40:54.184
- That's true, too.
- I don't understand.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.486
- Are you angry at him?
- You tell me.

40:56.488 --> 40:59.923
But if he raped you,
why would you kiss him?

40:59.925 --> 41:02.759
Because...

41:02.761 --> 41:06.029
he took something
very precious from me,

41:06.031 --> 41:09.766
and I wanted to take
a piece of it back.

41:09.768 --> 41:12.569
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, but for what?

41:12.571 --> 41:15.138
Introducing you to him.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.539
You'll be forgiven.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.776
When the night is over,
you'll both be forgiven.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.579
I see.

41:22.581 --> 41:27.150
That's what this evening is,
a ritual of atonement.

41:27.152 --> 41:30.186
When it's over,
we'll share an understanding

41:30.188 --> 41:33.857
that certain things
can be survived.

41:33.859 --> 41:38.495
Certain things
can be forgiven.

41:41.832 --> 41:46.736
Anyways, in my eyes,
you're equally responsible.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.404
I don't think that's fair.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.273
If a man puts a woman--

41:50.275 --> 41:54.511
locks a woman in a cage
with a lion,

41:54.513 --> 41:56.613
who's responsible for her death?

41:56.615 --> 41:58.982
The man or the lion?

41:58.984 --> 42:00.483
- What?
- Am I the lion?

42:00.485 --> 42:03.820
He's your friend.
You left me alone with him.

42:03.822 --> 42:04.621
[growls]

42:04.623 --> 42:06.089
- I know, but...
- Why?

42:06.091 --> 42:08.091
I told you, I went down
to the club to talk to the--

42:08.093 --> 42:09.526
Why did you leave me, Gregory?

42:09.528 --> 42:13.062
I asked you! I asked you
if you were gonna be okay.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.498
Tell me the real reason.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.367
You knew what would happen,
didn't you?

42:17.369 --> 42:18.701
- Yes, he knew.
- No, I promise you!

42:18.703 --> 42:20.637
You didn't know I'd be raped?

42:20.639 --> 42:23.873
Of course not! If I had known--
If I had suspected that--

42:23.875 --> 42:26.342
You knew Alan wanted to
sleep with me, didn't you?

42:26.344 --> 42:28.778
Well, I could see
he was attracted to you.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.247
And did I want
to sleep with him?

42:31.249 --> 42:33.583
- Yes, she did.
- I don't know.

42:33.585 --> 42:35.184
It seemed as if you liked him.

42:35.186 --> 42:38.354
I was 19, Gregory.

42:38.356 --> 42:41.057
I'd had one lover.

42:41.059 --> 42:44.027
Did I really seem
like the sort of girl

42:44.029 --> 42:47.196
who'd hop in the sack
with your friend here?

42:47.198 --> 42:49.699
I don't know. Maybe not.

42:49.701 --> 42:53.136
Then what did you think
would happen

42:53.138 --> 42:55.705
if you left us alone together?

42:55.707 --> 42:59.242
Left me alone with a lion

42:59.244 --> 43:03.613
who always, he tells me,

43:03.615 --> 43:08.384
always gets what he wants.

43:10.521 --> 43:13.156
Be honest.

43:13.158 --> 43:15.992
I thought that...

43:18.195 --> 43:21.931
- I didn't think about it.
- Yes, you did.

43:21.933 --> 43:25.234
Well, I thought that he'd
probably seduce you.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.670
And if I couldn't be seduced?

43:27.672 --> 43:29.339
Well, you were pretty drunk.

43:29.341 --> 43:31.407
I wasn't that drunk.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.910
No, no, I guess you weren't.

43:33.912 --> 43:39.549
I think now you see,
don't you?

43:39.551 --> 43:41.351
What I see?

43:41.353 --> 43:45.021
Yeah, yeah, I see.

43:48.559 --> 43:49.692
Well, done.

43:49.694 --> 43:51.761
No, well done, bravo.

43:56.367 --> 43:59.335
It's all right, Gregory.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.504
I'll forgive you.

44:02.840 --> 44:07.410
I'm really...
I'm very, very...

44:07.412 --> 44:11.180
Forget it.
Have a drink and relax

44:11.182 --> 44:15.818
because it's all
out in the open now.

44:15.820 --> 44:21.224
Everything's out in the open.

44:21.226 --> 44:24.861
When your parents died,
weren't you angry?

44:24.863 --> 44:26.529
Of course.

44:26.531 --> 44:29.666
There was someone else
involved, right?

44:29.668 --> 44:32.268
Two kids drag racing.

44:32.270 --> 44:35.538
One of them hung on
for a few weeks and died.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.708
The other lost two toes.

44:38.710 --> 44:40.543
That's it.

44:40.545 --> 44:43.479
Two fucking toes.

44:43.481 --> 44:47.083
Did you go see him,
this kid with the toes?

44:47.085 --> 44:48.584
What for?

44:48.586 --> 44:51.554
Oh, I don't know.

44:51.556 --> 44:54.557
If that was me,

44:54.559 --> 44:56.359
I'd want to look him
in the eye and say,

44:56.361 --> 44:57.960
"You killed my parents."

44:57.962 --> 45:01.964
I didn't want to think about it
any more than I had to.

45:01.966 --> 45:04.033
Yeah, I guess as we get older,

45:04.035 --> 45:08.037
we tend to face life
more squarely.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.706
I have time.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.341
In ten years,
they'll still be dead.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.544
In 20 years, 30.

45:14.546 --> 45:16.913
When I have children
and grandchildren,

45:16.915 --> 45:19.482
my parents will still be
lying on that road

45:19.484 --> 45:20.850
outside of Pittsburgh,

45:20.852 --> 45:23.986
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

45:23.988 --> 45:27.623
I hate cars.
I hate violence.

45:27.625 --> 45:30.993
Yeah, but it's part of life.

45:30.995 --> 45:33.629
I hate what you told me
about Gregory.

45:33.631 --> 45:35.498
You have to accept all of life,
Manya, otherwise--

45:35.500 --> 45:38.835
Why? Why do we? Why can't we
throw out the bad part?

45:38.837 --> 45:41.404
You throw it out,
and it'll come back at you.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.872
- Really?
- Every time.

45:42.874 --> 45:45.241
So we're just supposed
to live with it?

45:45.243 --> 45:47.009
I think so, yeah.

45:47.011 --> 45:52.148
But if I do that,
doesn't it become part of me?

45:52.150 --> 45:53.783
Eventually, yeah.

45:53.785 --> 45:56.419
- I don't want that to happen.
- It's gonna happen one way or--

45:56.421 --> 45:58.921
- I don't believe that!
- 'Cause you're young.

45:58.923 --> 46:00.656
I'm not that young!

46:00.658 --> 46:02.959
- Yes, you are.
- My parents died.

46:02.961 --> 46:06.362
So what?
Did that make you a grownup?

46:06.364 --> 46:08.865
- You still have heroes.
- Who?

46:08.867 --> 46:12.401
Your uncle,
your mother, father.

46:12.403 --> 46:14.837
My parents were
wonderful people.

46:14.839 --> 46:16.973
- Perhaps, but not heroes.
- Why do you say that?

46:16.975 --> 46:19.075
Because there are no heroes,
Manya.

46:19.077 --> 46:23.246
When you make heroes,
you're creating myths, lies.

46:23.248 --> 46:27.083
- Your uncle broke a man's legs.
- Yeah, but my parents didn't.

46:27.085 --> 46:29.152
They didn't do anything
like that.

46:29.154 --> 46:30.353
Not as far as I know,

46:30.355 --> 46:32.622
but that doesn't
make them perfect either.

46:32.624 --> 46:35.658
Of course not, but almost.

46:35.660 --> 46:38.094
Oh, you're so naive.

46:38.096 --> 46:41.631
How do you know?
You only met them once.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.833
That's right.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.835
You don't know
what you're talking about.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.937
I do. You think your parents
were perfect.

46:47.939 --> 46:49.906
I know for a fact
that's not true.

46:49.908 --> 46:51.908
What, did Gregory
tell you something?

46:51.910 --> 46:54.110
No, no.
Gregory didn't have to.

46:54.112 --> 46:56.779
I mean, Gregory knows,
but he didn't have to tell me.

46:56.781 --> 46:58.481
I know firsthand.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.783
What?

47:00.785 --> 47:03.085
What do you know?

47:04.755 --> 47:07.056
Have a drink, Manya.

47:18.936 --> 47:20.036
Good.

47:20.038 --> 47:22.605
As I said,

47:22.607 --> 47:24.607
I met your parents only once.

47:24.609 --> 47:26.075
Right. Dinner with Gregory.

47:26.077 --> 47:30.413
But I spoke to your father
many other times.

47:30.415 --> 47:32.248
Often, in fact.

47:32.250 --> 47:35.384
In fact, almost every time
he came to New York.

47:35.386 --> 47:38.487
Daddy called you?

47:38.489 --> 47:40.056
What for?

47:40.058 --> 47:42.358
He needed a place to stay.

47:42.360 --> 47:46.963
Oh, you mean he stayed here.

47:46.965 --> 47:50.666
What, for business?

47:50.668 --> 47:52.568
What do you think?

47:52.570 --> 47:55.404
- I don't believe it.
- Okay.

48:00.344 --> 48:05.047
You're saying
he always stayed here?

48:05.049 --> 48:07.183
There were even times he'd come
into the city with your mother,

48:07.185 --> 48:09.018
and he'd slip away
in the afternoon.

48:09.020 --> 48:10.319
- Stop it.
- Pretend he...

48:10.321 --> 48:11.487
I said stop it!

48:11.489 --> 48:13.990
Okay, I stopped.

48:16.026 --> 48:18.861
How do you know
what he did here?

48:24.134 --> 48:26.269
Do you know?

48:26.271 --> 48:28.371
I think so.

48:28.373 --> 48:30.473
How do you know?

48:35.612 --> 48:38.447
He'd ask for phone numbers.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.750
Girls.

48:42.786 --> 48:45.454
Blondes with big boobs?

48:45.456 --> 48:48.357
Sometimes.

48:48.359 --> 48:52.929
And he'd come here and
tape it for his own amusement?

48:52.931 --> 48:59.201
Other times he's ask for
thin brunettes.

48:59.203 --> 49:01.971
College girls
with long, dark hair

49:01.973 --> 49:04.907
and pert young breasts.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.587
It's amazing, isn't it?

49:18.589 --> 49:19.822
What?

49:19.824 --> 49:21.057
How readily
you believe all this.

49:21.059 --> 49:23.225
I just say it,
you believe it.

49:23.227 --> 49:26.329
Wait, wait, are you saying
that you just made all that up?

49:26.331 --> 49:27.964
No. It's true,
it's all true.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.665
I'm just pointing out
that you believe it.

49:29.667 --> 49:34.603
Okay, but I'm all confused now.
You got me all turned around.

49:34.605 --> 49:35.905
Why?

49:35.907 --> 49:37.506
I don't know
whether to believe it.

49:37.508 --> 49:39.241
It's true, Manya. And the fact
that you believed it

49:39.243 --> 49:41.544
means you knew
it was true already.

49:41.546 --> 49:43.279
You see that now, right?

49:43.281 --> 49:48.184
You see that even if it weren't
true, it would still be true.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.456
- Why did you tell me all this?
- Because I like you.

49:53.458 --> 49:57.393
So you make me unhappy?
That doesn't follow.

49:57.395 --> 50:00.663
No, I like you,
and I want you to grow up.

50:00.665 --> 50:03.399
Well, I can do that on my own,
thank you very much.

50:03.401 --> 50:05.368
I mean, it happens anyway,
doesn't it?

50:05.370 --> 50:08.204
No, some people never
open their eyes at all.

50:08.206 --> 50:09.972
Well, did it ever occur to you

50:09.974 --> 50:13.342
that maybe I didn't want
to have my eyes opened?

50:13.344 --> 50:15.244
Forced open?

50:15.246 --> 50:16.645
True, but you
waltz in here tonight

50:16.647 --> 50:18.447
like some goddamn princess

50:18.449 --> 50:21.617
and dancing and prancing with
your knight in shining armor,

50:21.619 --> 50:23.285
your uncle,

50:23.287 --> 50:26.589
mourning so romantically
for the lost king and queen,

50:26.591 --> 50:27.757
your parents.

50:27.759 --> 50:31.127
It was a little hard to take.

50:31.129 --> 50:32.962
I see.

50:35.432 --> 50:37.166
I want to go home.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.834
Not yet.

50:38.836 --> 50:42.805
I want to go.
I'm feeling really bad.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.373
Yeah.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.642
- Very, very sad.
- Well, it's okay to feel sad.

50:46.644 --> 50:50.312
Thank you for your permission!
I don't like you.

50:50.314 --> 50:52.348
Why? 'Cause I told you
the truth?

50:52.350 --> 50:55.618
I don't know. I don't know
how to think about this.

50:55.620 --> 50:58.554
Are you just being mean to me?

50:58.556 --> 51:02.091
No. No, not at all.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.660
Well, it feels like it.

51:04.662 --> 51:07.463
I told you I like you.

51:07.465 --> 51:09.165
Really?

51:09.167 --> 51:10.566
Yeah.

51:10.568 --> 51:12.501
You're one of the few.

51:12.503 --> 51:16.205
The few that's strong enough to
see the world as it really is.

51:16.207 --> 51:20.876
Not the way the stories say
it is or pretend it should be.

51:20.878 --> 51:23.746
But the truth...

51:23.748 --> 51:25.748
is very simple

51:25.750 --> 51:28.217
and very ugly.

51:28.219 --> 51:30.786
And you're strong enough
to see that and face it

51:30.788 --> 51:33.255
and move on.

51:33.257 --> 51:35.391
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

51:35.393 --> 51:37.760
No, don't cry, don't cry.

51:37.762 --> 51:39.795
Come here, come here.

51:39.797 --> 51:43.866
[crying]

51:43.868 --> 51:45.935
It's okay.

51:50.407 --> 51:53.909
Oh, you're delicate.
So, so delicate.

51:53.911 --> 51:55.377
Oh.

51:55.379 --> 51:57.947
Thank you.

51:58.882 --> 52:00.883
I needed to cry.

52:00.885 --> 52:02.318
Right.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.356
It's okay.

52:29.446 --> 52:33.415
Well, this has been
quite an evening.

52:33.417 --> 52:34.917
Yeah.

52:34.919 --> 52:37.586
That kiss.

52:37.588 --> 52:39.021
Yes.

52:39.023 --> 52:41.090
What did it mean?

52:41.092 --> 52:42.725
You know.

52:47.697 --> 52:49.698
I want to go home.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.300
Where is your home?

52:51.302 --> 52:54.870
Your uncle's apartment?

52:54.872 --> 52:59.074
I think you are
very beautiful.

52:59.076 --> 53:00.543
Exquisite.

53:02.479 --> 53:04.146
Really.

53:04.148 --> 53:07.016
I thought you liked
blondes with big boobs.

53:07.018 --> 53:08.350
Them too.

53:08.352 --> 53:11.453
This is all getting
a little crazy.

53:11.455 --> 53:13.622
I know.

53:13.624 --> 53:14.723
I'm scared.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.325
It's just feeling alive, Manya.

53:16.327 --> 53:18.928
No, no, it's not.
It's fear.

53:18.930 --> 53:21.530
I want to sleep with you.

53:21.532 --> 53:23.632
No.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.768
No.

53:25.770 --> 53:28.237
Yes, yes.

53:28.239 --> 53:29.738
I don't want to.

53:29.740 --> 53:32.808
Well, you don't have any choice.

53:32.810 --> 53:34.843
Of course I do.

53:34.845 --> 53:39.014
No, not tonight. I told you,
I always get what I want.

53:41.184 --> 53:44.520
You don't want to do that.

53:44.522 --> 53:46.855
Yes, I do.

53:50.327 --> 53:53.629
You're a nice person.

53:53.631 --> 53:56.198
No, I'm not.

54:01.204 --> 54:03.706
Help! Help!

54:04.774 --> 54:08.677
[doorknob rattles]

54:08.679 --> 54:16.085
[random touch tones]

54:16.087 --> 54:17.853
Help!

54:17.855 --> 54:21.357
[touch tones continue]

54:21.359 --> 54:24.360
Help!

54:36.973 --> 54:38.474
No.

54:38.476 --> 54:40.476
- [cloth tears]
- [scream]

54:42.112 --> 54:43.746
Please!

54:46.883 --> 54:49.518
[sobbing]

55:06.536 --> 55:08.270
I know.
It looks ridiculous,

55:08.272 --> 55:10.773
but I've saved
a lot of shirts this way.

55:20.283 --> 55:22.518
I feel like we're in church.

55:22.520 --> 55:23.619
You are.

55:23.621 --> 55:26.755
No, I mean with
the candles and the mood.

55:26.757 --> 55:29.391
Well, a meal is
a sacrament, right?

55:29.393 --> 55:31.160
I don't know about that, but...

55:31.162 --> 55:34.296
it looks and smells
absolutely sensational.

55:36.366 --> 55:37.700
We thank thee, Lord,

55:37.702 --> 55:39.635
for this food
we're about to receive,

55:39.637 --> 55:42.104
for the company
about to receive it.

55:42.106 --> 55:45.074
May you bathe us all
in your mercy.

55:45.076 --> 55:46.375
We need it.

55:48.244 --> 55:50.713
- Amen.
- Amen.

55:50.715 --> 55:52.614
Bon appétit.

55:57.821 --> 55:59.254
Mmm.

56:01.257 --> 56:04.526
This is exquisite. You said
it's stuffed with four cheeses?

56:04.528 --> 56:07.896
Ricotta, mozzarella,
gorgonzola dolce and Reggiano.

56:07.898 --> 56:10.432
The flavor's so rich,
it's just...

56:10.434 --> 56:11.834
I'm glad you like it.

56:11.836 --> 56:13.335
I was afraid you'd
lose your appetites,

56:13.337 --> 56:15.170
and all my work
would be for naught.

56:15.172 --> 56:17.139
The one thing is
I can always eat.

56:17.141 --> 56:19.274
When I'm happy,
I eat to celebrate.

56:19.276 --> 56:21.744
And if I'm unhappy,
I eat to feel better.

56:21.746 --> 56:24.646
Oh! I forgot the wine!

56:24.648 --> 56:29.218
It's not a proper meal
without wine, is it?

56:31.187 --> 56:33.322
Uncle, will you do the honors?

56:36.526 --> 56:39.027
Thanks.

56:39.029 --> 56:42.364
You know, Alan, there were
some things you said last year

56:42.366 --> 56:44.600
I've thought a lot about.

56:44.602 --> 56:45.501
What things?

56:45.503 --> 56:47.970
About not running away,

56:47.972 --> 56:49.671
confronting things head-on.

56:49.673 --> 56:52.574
Like your parents' death?

56:52.576 --> 56:54.309
Or what happened last year?

56:54.311 --> 56:57.880
Yes. Bad things.

56:59.249 --> 57:02.618
May we always remember
this evening.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.186
Amen.

57:04.188 --> 57:05.788
Hear, hear.

57:11.494 --> 57:13.228
Other things, too.

57:13.230 --> 57:15.664
You talked about
using your power.

57:15.666 --> 57:16.732
Yes.

57:16.734 --> 57:19.368
About how young I was,
how innocent.

57:19.370 --> 57:20.869
You were.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.471
What I really
think about, though,

57:22.473 --> 57:25.707
is the price you pay
when you lose it.

57:25.709 --> 57:31.747
You see, it's important to me
to be a good person.

57:31.749 --> 57:36.018
When I was innocent,
that really wasn't a problem.

57:36.020 --> 57:41.223
But now, well, I realize
I'm really capable of anything.

57:41.225 --> 57:42.424
Anything?

57:42.426 --> 57:46.428
And that scares me.
It really does.

57:46.430 --> 57:48.464
I don't know what you're
talking about, kid.

57:48.466 --> 57:50.599
You still seem like
a sweetheart to me.

57:50.601 --> 57:53.702
Then maybe I should tell you
the rest of my story.

57:53.704 --> 57:56.138
So now the truth comes out,
does it?

57:56.140 --> 57:59.975
When I got back to college,
everything was very strange,

57:59.977 --> 58:03.111
like I was looking at the world
from a great distance,

58:03.113 --> 58:06.949
just observing, watching what
other people did, what I did,

58:06.951 --> 58:10.586
like it was all happening
on television.

58:10.588 --> 58:14.957
And I'd laugh at people
or cry at inappropriate times,

58:14.959 --> 58:18.160
like the other students
weren't really there.

58:18.162 --> 58:21.430
They were just this show
I was watching.

58:21.432 --> 58:23.298
My friends tolerated it
at first,

58:23.300 --> 58:26.935
but after about a week or so,
they started to avoid me,

58:26.937 --> 58:30.172
except for my friend Sarah,
who was pre-med also

58:30.174 --> 58:32.674
and who I always studied with.

58:32.676 --> 58:34.776
Sarah teased me,
called me "Zombie."

58:34.778 --> 58:37.613
She'd tell me, "Come eat now,"
and I'd go eat,

58:37.615 --> 58:41.049
or if it was time
to go to class.

58:41.051 --> 58:43.285
She was kind of my nurse.

58:43.287 --> 58:45.087
Around Christmastime,

58:45.089 --> 58:50.292
in that distant way
I was observing everything,

58:50.294 --> 58:52.294
I realized I was pregnant.

58:52.296 --> 58:53.829
What?

58:53.831 --> 58:56.765
I said to myself,
"Manya missed her period.

58:56.767 --> 58:58.967
- She might be pregnant."
- From me, Manya?

58:58.969 --> 59:00.269
And I liked it.

59:00.271 --> 59:02.204
It's like it made the show
more interesting.

59:02.206 --> 59:06.708
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you saying I'm the father?

59:06.710 --> 59:09.845
There wasn't
anyone else, Alan.

59:09.847 --> 59:13.048
You got pregnant
from one fuck?

59:13.050 --> 59:14.550
One fuck, one sperm.

59:14.552 --> 59:17.085
That's kind of
all it takes, right?

59:17.087 --> 59:18.453
How it happens?

59:18.455 --> 59:20.055
Right, but I...

59:20.057 --> 59:22.491
I ate compulsively,
and I gained a lot of weight.

59:22.493 --> 59:24.359
25 pounds
by the end of January.

59:24.361 --> 59:27.129
Hold on.
I think I figured it out,

59:27.131 --> 59:29.665
why you invited me here
tonight.

59:29.667 --> 59:30.666
Why?

59:30.668 --> 59:32.401
You want me to pay
for your baby.

59:32.403 --> 59:34.870
<i>Our</i> baby.

59:34.872 --> 59:39.541
And yes, Alan,
I want you to pay.

59:39.543 --> 59:41.577
Where's the baby?

59:44.147 --> 59:47.082
I kept watching myself.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.651
Watch Manya gain 30 pounds.

59:49.653 --> 59:52.521
Watch her freak everyone out
by not talking.

59:52.523 --> 59:54.656
Watch her study
for 12 hours a day

59:54.658 --> 59:57.025
and ace all of her tests.

59:57.027 --> 59:59.227
Finally, Sarah couldn't
take it anymore.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:00.729
She screamed, slapped me,

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:03.131
told me I had to come back
from wherever I was

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:06.602
or she'd abandon me
just like everyone else.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.070
Did you have the baby?

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.871
- I didn't.
- What?

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:12.908
The odd thing was it didn't
occur to me for a long time

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:16.078
that being pregnant meant
that I was going to have a baby.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.113
Rape Baby, I called it.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.515
The baby started kicking.

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:22.918
And that's what
brought me out of it.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.188
Plus my back hurt,
and I was getting hemorrhoids.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:32.361
And it finally hit me
that this wasn't TV.

01:00:32.363 --> 01:00:35.063
I was really in this fat body,

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:39.635
and this fat body really did
have a baby inside of it.

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:42.604
And I was really
gonna have that baby

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:44.573
unless I did something
about it.

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.174
So I went to a doctor
in Philly.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.843
An abortionist.

01:00:47.845 --> 01:00:50.646
Yeah, but he wouldn't do it
because I was so far along.

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:51.947
I would think not.

01:00:51.949 --> 01:00:54.549
And even though
I'd been raped,

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:56.151
well, after a certain point,

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:59.621
it stops being an abortion,
technically speaking,

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:02.491
and it becomes
a premature delivery.

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:04.092
A murder.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.828
Yes.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.732
So no other doctor
would touch it either.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:15.237
And then one night,
a very black night alone,

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:16.638
it came to me.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.740
I talked to Sarah,

01:01:18.742 --> 01:01:21.009
and, well, I didn't tell her
the whole plan.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.010
What plan?

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.879
She was going out
with this guy

01:01:23.881 --> 01:01:26.815
who graduated the year before
and was in med school at Penn.

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:28.583
A really sweet guy. Phillip.

01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:30.752
I mean, he was nuts
to do what he did,

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:34.690
but he gave us what we needed
and told Sarah what to do,

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:36.925
and we figured
we could pull it off.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.593
- Pull what off?
- Abort it.

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:41.530
You aborted
a six-month-old baby?

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:43.865
25 weeks.

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:48.603
- Was it born alive?
- No.

01:01:48.605 --> 01:01:50.605
But it might have been, right?

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:52.607
Not the way we did it.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:54.710
You killed the baby.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:57.879
My baby.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.582
Yes. You fathered a child,

01:02:00.584 --> 01:02:03.719
and I let it grow
until it was pretty big

01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:05.520
and its heart was beating.

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:09.691
But I didn't want it to live,
and so I killed it.

01:02:09.693 --> 01:02:13.795
I did to it
what you did to me.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.265
No.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.567
Not at all.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:22.604
It felt pretty close.

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:26.408
Was it a boy or a girl?

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:29.077
This is how we did it.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:32.614
Phillip gave us
an empty syringe, a speculum,

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.416
another syringe
full of saline.

01:02:34.418 --> 01:02:37.886
Oh, and then in case
things didn't go smoothly,

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:41.323
this thing about that long,

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:43.825
called an "amniotic hook."

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:46.027
The medical equivalent
of a knitting needle.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.396
- I don't believe this.
- I know!

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:51.767
And it was the worst time
of year, final exams.

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:54.603
But I had a week between
my bio and chem finals

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.104
and another week before orals,

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.774
so we figured
I'd make it through.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:02.210
Phillip made it clear to Sarah
and indirectly to me

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.113
that what we were doing
was very dangerous.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.249
And completely illegal.

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.485
Oh, sorry, Alan.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.789
Legal, illegal. I didn't think
those things concerned you.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:18.894
As I was saying, dangerous.

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:20.862
If the fetus doesn't
come out quickly,

01:03:20.864 --> 01:03:24.166
severe, even fatal infection
is pretty likely.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.867
I didn't care.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:28.737
I knew exactly
what I wanted to do.

01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:32.707
First, I peed,
emptied the bladder.

01:03:32.709 --> 01:03:34.810
Then Sarah gave me
a local anesthetic

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:36.711
and prepared the needle.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:37.946
I hate needles,

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:40.348
and this mother
had a 14-gauge bore.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.751
It was huge.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.188
She felt around for my uterus

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.757
and stuck the needle
straight through my belly.

01:03:48.759 --> 01:03:50.959
- Jesus.
- First she pulls the plunger

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.829
and takes out 100 CCs
of amniotic fluid,

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:56.665
then she switches the syringe
and injects 50 CCs

01:03:56.667 --> 01:04:00.902
of hypertonic super-saturated
saline solution.

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:04.039
That's what killed the baby.

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:06.074
Yes.

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:08.577
- Sounds efficient.
- Yep.

01:04:08.579 --> 01:04:12.147
Can you speed this up?
It's a little hard to take.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:13.381
Right?

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:14.983
So then we wait.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:17.686
Nothing happens.
No contractions.

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.688
The saline,
as well as killing the kid,

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.122
is supposed to induce labor,

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:23.592
but my uterus
hadn't read the textbooks.

01:04:23.594 --> 01:04:27.963
I just lay there in
this kind of existential hell.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:31.766
Sarah's sipping Diet Coke
and studying for her exams,

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:35.370
and I'm just waiting.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:40.275
Through all this,
what keeps me going is my anger.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:44.713
A light, an ugliness
shining in the distance.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:48.316
Very far away,
but clear and bright.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:50.518
And every time
I start to freak out,

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.188
I close my eyes and see it.

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.657
You know that anger,
don't you, Alan?

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.959
Everyone knows it, my dear,

01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.962
but only a few of us
are able to harness it.

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.697
Yes.

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:06.968
Phillip told us if the fetus
didn't come out in 12 hours,

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.536
we should use the hook.

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:11.506
But the hook increases
the risk of infection.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.508
Sarah didn't want to try it.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:14.743
I forced her.

01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:17.112
My cervix is
slightly dilated now,

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.614
and so she reaches up there
with this thing.

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:21.416
Poke and pull,
poke and pull.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:24.219
The damn bag is slippery.
And Sarah's crying

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:26.688
because she's afraid
she's gonna tear me open.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.023
But she doesn't.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:31.526
- The water finally bursts.
- Thank God.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:34.062
Philip says if the baby
doesn't come right out,

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:36.264
we have to go to the hospital.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.833
Sarah's in a panic.
What if I die?

01:05:38.835 --> 01:05:40.835
What if she's arrested
for manslaughter?

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:42.704
But I refuse to go.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:46.741
No doctors, no hospitals,
no nurses.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:49.144
It has to be
just me and Sarah.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:52.247
"It's going to be okay,"
I tell her.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:55.784
Everything's going to be okay.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.857
By midnight, 15 hours,

01:06:02.859 --> 01:06:07.228
Rape Baby finally comes out.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.097
Jesus Christ.

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:11.099
She cleaned up,
and every hour or so,

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:13.501
she'd come back
to check on the bleeding.

01:06:13.503 --> 01:06:15.971
- You hemorrhaged?
- Some.

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:18.740
- Was it bad?
- When it didn't stop,

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:20.809
Phillip made Sarah
call an ambulance,

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:23.912
and they finally
took me to the hospital.

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:26.548
Were there any other
repercussions?

01:06:32.054 --> 01:06:34.889
What you did was
completely illegal.

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:37.425
Somebody could have
called the police.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:39.694
Yes.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.597
But they didn't.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:46.001
They were merciful.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:51.106
That's about it, I guess.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.677
Why did you tell us
this story?

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:58.013
I thought you'd want to know.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:07:02.250
People view sex
as a form of recreation,

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:05.720
like jogging or racquetball.

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:08.923
But sex does not exist
for sport.

01:07:08.925 --> 01:07:11.593
It exists for reproduction.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:12.927
To make babies.

01:07:12.929 --> 01:07:14.662
Right, so?

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:17.399
So next time, Alan,

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:22.437
you feel like raping
some 19-year old girl,

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:26.474
you should think about
what might happen.

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:35.183
- I feel sick.
- Already?

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:39.988
I don't know if I've ever
heard a story as gruesome.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.758
Uh, Alan, how do you feel?

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.960
How do I feel?

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:49.597
Like something's missing.

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.534
Yeah, I get the feeling--

01:07:52.536 --> 01:07:54.903
Don't you get the feeling
she left something out?

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:57.072
I sure hope not.

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:00.608
There's something
you didn't tell us.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.245
- What could that be?
- Well, I don't know.

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:12.520
You said something.
You referred once to your plan.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:15.590
Very good, Alan.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:21.796
What was that plan?

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:23.430
Isn't it obvious?

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:26.734
To have you to dinner
and tell you my story.

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:28.970
There's something else.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:32.941
You wouldn't go
to the hospital,

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:35.676
even though your life
was in danger.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:38.680
Right.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:40.515
You see...

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:47.455
I didn't leave something out.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.258
I left something in.

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:55.363
I froze the placenta, Alan.

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:56.598
What?

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.767
And I froze the baby.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.604
I put them both in the freezer.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.305
Go on.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.343
Wait. What...

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:10.411
What did you do with them?

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.743
[chuckles]

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.390
Alan?

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:02.263
It was a boy.

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:25.253
<i>Last year I got a letter</i>
<i>from Alan.</i>

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:29.824
<i>He says he can't stop</i>
<i>thinking about me.</i>

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:33.328
<i>I'm the one woman, he says,</i>

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:36.764
he can't get out of his dreams.
