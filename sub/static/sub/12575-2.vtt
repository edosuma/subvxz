PEGGY: I'm in my office.

00:45.778 --> 00:46.802
HANK: Peggy?

00:47.546 --> 00:49.946
<i>Peggy, I've got a situation here.</i>

00:52.551 --> 00:54.883
Oh, Hank, is it your back again?

00:55.120 --> 00:58.385
Why won't you wear that
weightlifting belt I got you for Christmas?

00:58.457 --> 01:00.755
It's not a belt. It's a girdle.

01:00.859 --> 01:03.020
Take off your shirt. I'll get the Icy Hot.

01:06.465 --> 01:07.489
[Groans]

01:07.566 --> 01:08.828
Icy! Icy!

<i>[Sighing]</i>

01:10.769 --> 01:11.827
Hot.

01:12.604 --> 01:14.731
All right. Okay.

01:15.641 --> 01:18.769
- Hey.
- Peggy! Not in front of the B-O-Y.

01:18.911 --> 01:21.311
I need both of you to sign
this permission slip.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.575
All righty. What's it for, son?

01:23.916 --> 01:27.113
Contact football?
No, you're not old enough for that.

01:27.319 --> 01:28.479
Ringworm test?

01:29.088 --> 01:31.147
<i>What? Sexual Education?</i>

01:31.623 --> 01:34.183
- Where'd you get this?
- I told you. At school.

01:34.259 --> 01:37.786
I thought we didn't have to worry
about this until 9th grade health class.

01:37.863 --> 01:40.855
No. The principal wants to teach us
a unit from some course...

01:40.933 --> 01:42.628
they made up in Washington, DC.

01:42.701 --> 01:45.192
Washington? Bobby, go to your room.

01:48.207 --> 01:49.731
Well, what are we gonna do?

01:49.808 --> 01:52.971
Here's the first thing I'm gonna do,
I'll tell you what.

01:53.045 --> 01:57.379
There. No need for Bobby
to get all bothered up learning about sex...

01:57.449 --> 02:00.612
when he can't do a damn thing about it
anyway, at his age...

02:00.686 --> 02:02.449
and with his features.

02:03.088 --> 02:06.057
<i>Besides, it is not up to
the United States government...</i>

02:06.125 --> 02:08.320
to be teaching Bobby the facts of life.

02:08.460 --> 02:10.018
That's his parents' job.

02:10.095 --> 02:13.690
I agree. If anybody should teach our boy
about that...

02:13.932 --> 02:15.957
it should be his parents.

02:16.035 --> 02:19.372
<i>Something like that
should be taught in the home.</i>

02:19.505 --> 02:21.029
Where he lives.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.739
Absolutely.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.104
Yes siree.

02:27.713 --> 02:29.408
Well, you're the expert.

02:29.582 --> 02:33.575
<i>Substitute Teacher of the Year 1996,
as I recall.</i>

02:33.853 --> 02:36.287
Oh, Hank, I'm also a decent woman.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.917
I got my back out here, Peg.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.425

[Knocking]

02:46.031 --> 02:47.191
PEGGY: Bobby?

02:49.668 --> 02:51.158
Bobby, honey.

02:52.438 --> 02:55.464
What do you know about sexual relations?

02:55.875 --> 02:58.309
I don't know. Nothing much.

02:59.478 --> 03:01.969
I'm a little worried about being a slut.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.070
[Murmurs]

03:03.749 --> 03:08.311
Well, Bobby, your father and I decided
that as your parents...

03:08.888 --> 03:12.415
that you and I should have a little talk
on the subject.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.625
You have noticed, I am sure, that...

03:16.061 --> 03:19.656
there are some pretty big differences
between boys and girls.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.634
I'm sure you know that.

03:23.569 --> 03:27.130
I mean, physically, boys are,
well, they're different.

03:28.607 --> 03:31.440
They have something
that girls do not have.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.370
Yeah.

03:33.712 --> 03:36.704
You know, something...

03:37.683 --> 03:39.310
You mean, a penis?

03:45.758 --> 03:47.692
<i>I didn't take Sex Ed in school.</i>

03:47.760 --> 03:50.558
HANK: Come on, Boomhauer,
if you're gonna prune, prune.

03:50.663 --> 03:54.690
The army taught me everything,
and in four different languages, too.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.395
Want to know how to get a bargirl
in the Philippines?

03:57.470 --> 04:01.770
The point is, there is no way my son
is learning the how-tos of romance...

04:01.841 --> 04:04.742
from some
bureaucrat regulatory handbook.

04:04.810 --> 04:08.041
<i>Tu-mai-ho, or something like that.</i>

04:08.113 --> 04:11.082
And, Dale,
I'd say the same applies to your Joseph.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.675
I'd tear that permission slip up,
if I were you.

04:13.752 --> 04:15.549
I'll do that and then some.

04:15.621 --> 04:18.055
<i>This Sex Ed stuff
goes higher than the schools.</i>

04:18.123 --> 04:22.150
It's that same old clubberone
zero-population bulldink...

04:22.228 --> 04:24.492
that the UN's been trying for years.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.997
[Muttering] Tell you what.
This branch is fixing to...

04:27.066 --> 04:30.058
it's going, it's going to be...
Y'all, heads up!

04:31.136 --> 04:34.902
They want to whittle us down
so we can't keep a standing army.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.807
That's when
the Chinese'll come marching in.

04:38.110 --> 04:42.046
All I'm saying is, keep the government
out of the bedroom business.

04:42.181 --> 04:45.173
Teaching my boy the facts of life is my job.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.651
DALE: Damn straight.
BILL: You got that right.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.752
Hank, I couldn't get the words out.

04:49.822 --> 04:53.417
Oh, you didn't send her in
to do a man's job, did you?

04:53.726 --> 04:54.715
Well, l...

04:54.793 --> 04:57.523
Maybe you should let Boomhauer
teach him what he knows.

04:57.596 --> 05:01.054
[Muttering] You talk about them dang old
condom dispenser with them be.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.897
Put in 50 cents.
And they try to hit that corner...

05:03.969 --> 05:06.938
turn and bang on that thing,
and talking about her needs.

05:07.706 --> 05:11.301
God, no, that's all right. I guess I'll do it.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.735
My daddy told me the facts of life...

05:13.812 --> 05:16.542
when I was Bobby's age,
and I turned out okay.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.909
Yeehaw!

05:20.986 --> 05:22.510
What you crying for, boy?

05:22.588 --> 05:24.988
This is a good show.
This is a damn good show.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.313
Yeah.

05:26.525 --> 05:29.460
That's also how he taught me
about paying taxes.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.694
Well, there used to be a dairy farm
out here somewhere.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.325
Oh, there we go.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.430
Gracie, this is Mr. Hill.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.438
Brought his son over
to learn the facts of life.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.842
GRACIE: Well, he sure
came to the right place.

05:46.912 --> 05:49.540
We call this machine the Matchmaker 500.

05:49.748 --> 05:51.238
[Generator humming]

05:51.317 --> 05:56.152
Bobby, you're coming to a time in your life
when you're gonna start...

05:56.221 --> 05:58.849
to have tender feelings for a girl.

05:59.725 --> 06:02.387
You're gonna need to know
what those feelings mean...

06:02.461 --> 06:04.361
and what to do about them.

06:05.130 --> 06:06.597
[Mooing]

06:07.733 --> 06:09.098
Oh, my God!

06:09.735 --> 06:12.226
Where's the other half
of that dang permission slip?

06:12.304 --> 06:14.465
I'm sure they'll do a good job at school.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.770
The health teacher
is a trained professional.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.165
Keep digging.

06:21.013 --> 06:24.915
<i>Hey, Hank, I wouldn't sweat it anymore
about that Sex Ed stuff.</i>

06:25.150 --> 06:26.640
What do you mean?

06:26.719 --> 06:31.156
All you gotta know is, I took care of it
with one little phone call.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.080
[Chuckling]

06:34.760 --> 06:36.227
Hey, Peg Leg.

06:36.862 --> 06:38.523
That was Bobby's principal.

06:38.597 --> 06:42.533
<i>Some right-wing maniac called the health
teacher with a death threat and she quit.</i>

06:42.601 --> 06:43.659
Oh, well.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.500
I'm sure it was just
some harmless nutcase.

06:49.408 --> 06:53.276
<i>Hey, on the bright side, since there's
no one to teach that Sex Ed course...</i>

06:53.345 --> 06:56.246
we can put all this ugliness
back in the closet.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.476
Oh, no, Hank. They found someone.

06:58.550 --> 07:01.417
<i>They found
the Substitute Teacher of the Year.</i>

07:02.187 --> 07:03.814

07:04.056 --> 07:05.921
1996.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.396
PEGGY: Oh, my. Oh, Lord.

07:14.033 --> 07:15.557
For goodness' sake.

07:16.969 --> 07:20.097
This beauty school homework is hard,
Aunt Peggy.

07:21.340 --> 07:22.739
LUANNE: Aunt Peggy?

07:23.409 --> 07:26.708
Oh, I'm sorry, Luanne,
I was not paying attention.

07:26.779 --> 07:31.409
<i>Listen to this chapter title.
"The 14 Stages of Arousal."</i>

07:31.717 --> 07:33.742
And then you turn the page, it...

07:33.919 --> 07:36.717
Oh, my goodness! Is that C. Everett Koop?

07:36.989 --> 07:40.425
That must be an old book,
because now there's 18 stages.

07:40.492 --> 07:41.686
Oh, my.

07:41.827 --> 07:44.990
How am I gonna say these words out loud
in front of a class?

07:45.064 --> 07:46.053
Let me see.

07:46.732 --> 07:51.465
<i>"Self-exploration is a perfectly natural
exercise throughout pubescence."</i>

07:52.037 --> 07:53.436
What's so hard about that?

07:53.505 --> 07:58.442
Luanne, honey, tell me, what is it like
to live without shame of any kind?

07:58.911 --> 08:00.708
Is it a good feeling?

08:01.747 --> 08:03.874
Yeah, it is.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.845
I guess I am a little jealous.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.148
Things were very different
when I was a girl.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.783
Honey, you're at that special time of life.

08:12.191 --> 08:15.354
The time when a little girl
becomes a woman.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.394
And you start getting a monthly visitor.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.355
Who? Uncle Joe?

08:21.967 --> 08:25.061
My mother gave me this,
and I'm passing it on to you.

08:25.971 --> 08:27.996
<i>"The Loveliness of Woman."</i>

08:29.475 --> 08:32.568
There's nothing in here
but pictures of flowers.

08:33.010 --> 08:37.710
I never even kissed a boy until I was 20.
Of course, he's dead now.

08:39.985 --> 08:43.818
Look. Here's a chapter on communicating
your needs to your love partner.

08:43.889 --> 08:46.551
What kind of filth are you reading?

08:46.625 --> 08:48.559

08:49.695 --> 08:52.721
Let me take a look at that.
What in the hell?

08:53.232 --> 08:56.724
That is the inside of a womb.
A woman's womb.

08:57.302 --> 09:00.430
My boy is not gonna look at
the inside of a womb.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.838
He's only been out of yours for 11 years.

09:02.941 --> 09:04.966
I think I need some water.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.701
You want my Chandler or my Ross?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.007
Can I shoot him full of BBs?

09:10.249 --> 09:12.376
- Okay.
- Then Ross.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.214
You sure you don't want him?

09:15.621 --> 09:17.851
I'm not gonna need my toys anymore.

09:17.923 --> 09:20.915
<i>After I learn Sex Ed, I'll be too busy dating.</i>

09:21.393 --> 09:22.451
Who?

I don't know.
Whoever wants to have sex with me.

09:27.765 --> 09:30.393
HANK: Well, what do you think?
A few more inches?

09:30.468 --> 09:32.868
You might as well.
It's just gonna keep growing.

09:32.937 --> 09:36.065
- Well, so much for my phone call.
- What are you talking about?

09:36.140 --> 09:40.133
<i>DALE: They found some other
depraved harlot to teach that Sex Ed class.</i>

09:40.278 --> 09:42.212
- Dale...
- Don't worry, Hank.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.681
I know people who can take care of her,
if you know what I mean.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.684
That woman is my wife.

09:47.752 --> 09:49.617
I thought Peggy was your wife.

09:49.687 --> 09:53.589
<i>Dale, I think he's saying
Peggy's the new Sex teacher.</i>

10:00.665 --> 10:01.893
Yeah? What?

10:01.966 --> 10:04.526
- Nothing, I wasn't saying nothing.
- Nothing at all.

10:04.602 --> 10:07.537
Nothing wrong with
a little sexual education.

10:07.605 --> 10:12.008
No, sir, I bet Peggy'll be introducing
some new ideas into the bedroom.

10:12.076 --> 10:13.008
Dale!

10:13.077 --> 10:16.604
I'm just saying, a woman who knows
is the toughest customer.

10:16.681 --> 10:18.581
Maybe you ought to hit the books, too.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.617
HANK: What the hell is wrong with you all?

10:20.685 --> 10:22.983
Nothing, Hank. Just think.

10:23.087 --> 10:26.818
You'll be married to a woman
who knows everything about sex.

10:27.158 --> 10:29.854
I've never been with a woman like that.

10:30.028 --> 10:32.223
Except, of course, a bargirl.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.825
Of course, I don't mean that...

10:34.899 --> 10:38.198
Peggy's a bargirl or nothing like that.

10:38.269 --> 10:40.863
<i>She just knows, you know...</i>

10:40.938 --> 10:43.133
what a bargirl knows.

10:46.411 --> 10:49.380
PEGGY: You know, there's a funny thing
happening down at school.

10:49.447 --> 10:53.816
<i>They want me to teach this Sex Ed stuff
to our kids' class, you know.</i>

10:53.885 --> 10:55.716
I don't know if I can overcome...

10:55.787 --> 10:58.278
the crippling sense of shame
I got from my mother.

10:58.856 --> 11:00.289
We knew you wouldn't.

11:00.358 --> 11:04.294
Yeah, I've been telling people,
Peggy Hill is not one of those teachers...

11:04.362 --> 11:08.230
that puts all of that intellectual hooey
above common decency.

11:09.567 --> 11:13.936
Well, sometimes a little intellectual hooey
is a good thing.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.733
Look. We all grew up
not knowing the real words for...

11:16.808 --> 11:19.504
your "dinky" and your "woohoo,"
and we turned out fine.

11:19.577 --> 11:21.568
I learned about sex from my mother.

11:21.646 --> 11:24.843
<i>She gave me that wonderful book,
The Loveliness of Woman.</i>

11:24.916 --> 11:27.749
- That book is worthless.
- Well, I got a lot out of it.

11:27.819 --> 11:31.346
When my husband would crawl
all over me at night and do his business...

11:31.422 --> 11:35.324
why, I would just close my eyes
and think of them pretty flowers.

11:35.393 --> 11:37.554
Oh, Bonnie. You poor, poor woman.

11:39.597 --> 11:42.725
<i>Hey, Bobby,
your mom's gonna teach Sex Ed.</i>

11:42.967 --> 11:44.434
Yeah, I know.

11:45.636 --> 11:48.036
We're gonna get to see her boobs.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.064
<i>So?</i>

11:50.174 --> 11:51.334
HANK: Bobby, you're up.

11:51.409 --> 11:52.933
MAN: Come on, Bobby.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.544
Your dad lost his job.

11:58.216 --> 12:01.014
