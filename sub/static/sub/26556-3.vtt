WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.915
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:02.959 --> 00:05.396
After 6 years
of being a vigilante,

00:05.440 --> 00:07.050
the only way to achieve my goal

00:07.094 --> 00:10.445
and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.

00:10.488 --> 00:14.492
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.059
I am no longer a hero.

00:16.103 --> 00:20.672
Now I am inmate 4587.

00:20.716 --> 00:21.978
Previously on "Arrow"...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.501
You hired those prisoners

00:23.545 --> 00:25.416
to attack me
in the shower for Diaz.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.940
So why don't you tell me
how I can find him?

00:27.984 --> 00:30.291
You got to prove yourself
worthy of my friendship.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.292
What do you want?

00:31.335 --> 00:32.989
I want him gone.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.906
You stabbed me.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.734
- I didn't stab you.
- Get away from him.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.170
The video! That guard
stabbed me. He stabbed me!

00:40.214 --> 00:43.130
I didn't!
I didn't do anything!

00:43.173 --> 00:44.522
You made a deal with my husband.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.742
And he's in prison
because of it.

00:46.785 --> 00:49.832
Now it's your turn to hold up
your side of the bargain.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.749
We're gonna take down
Ricardo Diaz together.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.573
You promised the FBI would
stay in star city

01:35.617 --> 01:37.009
until Diaz was off the board.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.620
And as you can see,
we're still here.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.100
Yeah, but you
haven't caught him.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.840
Apprehending Diaz is
still a priority,

01:41.884 --> 01:44.191
but he's not the only
criminal on our list.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.714
- Let me help.
- Excuse me?

01:45.757 --> 01:47.411
You've seen what I can
do with the tck, tck.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.370
Heh. We have our own
experts, Ms. Smoak.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.849
But not as expert as me.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.938
I know everything there is
to know about Diaz

01:52.982 --> 01:54.418
and the longbow hunters.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.377
Yeah! They're here, too.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.074
Diaz brought in
the bad guy big guns,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.032
which means you don't have
any more time to waste.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.731
So give me a computer
and put me to work.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.385
My agreement with your husband,

02:04.428 --> 02:05.690
it gives you immunity.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.388
It doesn't make us allies.

02:07.431 --> 02:10.259
Diaz attacked me while
I was in protective custody.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.609
My husband is in prison.

02:11.653 --> 02:14.264
I had to send my son away.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.874
Your deal with Oliver

02:15.918 --> 02:18.138
ruined my life and the city's.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.227
All I'm asking of you
is to hold up

02:20.270 --> 02:22.620
your side of the bargain.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.754
I'm sorry you were attacked,

02:25.797 --> 02:28.060
but it's not my fault
your husband's in prison.

02:28.104 --> 02:30.193
It was his choice
to put on that hood,

02:30.237 --> 02:32.064
and it was his choice
to turn himself in.

02:32.108 --> 02:35.198
Go home.
Enjoy your freedom.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.635
Leave the crime fighting to me.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.425
My husband spent
the last 6 years

02:44.468 --> 02:46.644
fighting for
the people of this city,

02:46.688 --> 02:48.298
risking everything,

02:48.342 --> 02:50.648
and now he sits in prison,
his life on the line,

02:50.692 --> 02:53.825
while this monster
gets to walk free.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.395
That isn't justice.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.882
Wow. I still can't believe
you stabbed yourself.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.450
Did you hit anything big,

03:09.493 --> 03:11.278
like your liver or something?

03:11.321 --> 03:14.150
Right. You probably
don't even have a liver,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.673
just muscle.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.285
You think I had
any other choice?

03:29.034 --> 03:31.123
I did what you asked.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.256
Now tell me what you
know about Diaz.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.910
That wasn't exactly what I meant

03:34.953 --> 03:36.346
by getting rid of yorke.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.869
Well, I found a better way.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.045
Heh! He still thinks
he's a hero.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.917
You're a bigger idiot
than I thought.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.962
Easy, gents.
A deal's a deal.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.487
Getting yorke off our back
means we're in business.

03:46.530 --> 03:49.490
Thanks to Queen here,
we're gonna have

03:49.533 --> 03:51.274
one hell of a night.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.449
Where is Diaz?

03:52.493 --> 03:55.278
I don't know,
but I do know who does.

03:55.322 --> 03:58.281
There's an informant
here at slabside.

03:58.325 --> 04:02.677
Anything that goes on here
goes through the demon first.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.376
- The demon?
- Yeah.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.422
The person who arranged
the hit on you

04:08.465 --> 04:10.859
and who's the direct
connection to Diaz.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.253
All I did was handle
the transaction,

04:13.296 --> 04:16.386
but seeing as how I'm
a man of my word,

04:16.430 --> 04:18.257
I will arrange the meeting.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.607
You really expect me
to trust you?

04:19.649 --> 04:22.262
You don't have
much choice, now, do you?

04:22.305 --> 04:23.872
When?

04:23.915 --> 04:28.833
Tonight, cell 3-b
after lights out.

04:32.097 --> 04:35.144
And you will know when.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.717
Stall all you want.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.762
Eventually you're gonna break.

04:44.806 --> 04:48.331
And when you do,
I'll be right here.

04:48.375 --> 04:52.857
Last chance
before I bring her in.

04:57.601 --> 05:01.475
Did you or did you not eat
this entire box of cookies?

05:04.347 --> 05:05.479
It's ok, honey.

05:05.522 --> 05:08.395
You just got a little
hungry, didn't you?

05:08.438 --> 05:10.701
Now you have a tummy-ache.

05:10.745 --> 05:12.050
Well, now we know what
happens when we

05:12.094 --> 05:14.226
eat too much sugar, right?

05:14.270 --> 05:16.881
Come on.
Let's go say hi to Ella.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.970
She has lots of
fun stuff planned

05:19.014 --> 05:21.495
while dad and I are out of town.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.105
I was working on him
for 20 minutes.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.585
You get him to
confess in 15 seconds?

05:24.628 --> 05:27.457
I'm his mother and your boss.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.590
We leave in 5.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.505
Yeah, packed and ready.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.421
Oh. You don't sound
too happy about that.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.466
I just wish we
would've caught Diaz

05:36.510 --> 05:37.728
before heading abroad.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.121
- We will.
- Yeah.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.210
And Felicity will
be fine, I promise.

05:41.253 --> 05:43.908
I think you could use
a change of scenery.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.954
It'll be like
a second honeymoon.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.434
Yay, with Curtis.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.046
Well, deadshot and cupid
came with us on our first.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.830
No, that is not our
first honeymoon.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.833
Our first honeymoon
was in Hawaii, remember?

05:55.877 --> 05:57.922
The hammocks by the beach.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.924
- Hawaii was nice.
- Hawaii was really nice.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.666
You know, I thought it'd be a lot
more difficult working with you.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.276
Being together 24/7?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.409
But adventure was always
what kept us strong.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.499
- Dangerous ops.
- Romance on the front line.

06:09.543 --> 06:12.372
- We make a good team.
- We make the best team.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.425
Ricardo Diaz took over
a whole city.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.079
Then we dismantled
his infrastructure.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.602
He's not an imminent threat.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.387
He's got new allies.

06:27.430 --> 06:30.041
One of them hacked into
the CDC's secure network,

06:30.085 --> 06:31.565
specifically their
security protocols.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.436
They're planning something.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.003
You deduced that
from this photograph

06:35.046 --> 06:36.657
and one unsubstantiated hack?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.441
It's the only lead we got
in months, and you know it.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.312
We can't let that slip away.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.489
Then bring me something
concrete I can act on.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.621
CDC's security system
is airtight.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.929
No one gets in without a
level 5 security clearance.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.018
I can't waste valuable resources

06:50.061 --> 06:51.976
on something
this circumstantial.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.543
You mean someone who
dropped to number 27

06:53.587 --> 06:55.415
on our most wanted list.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.459
That, too.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.200
Tell the CDC they've
been hacked.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.637
They can handle it
as they see fit.

07:00.681 --> 07:03.945
I need your focus
elsewhere, agent.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.432
I guess her heart isn't
completely made out of stone.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.824
Bugging the FBI...

07:13.868 --> 07:16.174
maybe not the best move
for our immunity deal.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.176
I'm going with
the ask for forgiveness

07:18.220 --> 07:20.396
instead of
permission type thing.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.920
When you said you were done
with the a.R.G.U.S. Way,

07:22.964 --> 07:24.618
you weren't joking.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.490
John has priorities other
than catching Diaz. I don't.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.144
I really appreciate you
wanting to help

07:29.187 --> 07:31.929
and letting me sleep
on your couch,

07:31.973 --> 07:33.496
which is a lot more
comfortable than it looks.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.630
I've been dying to get
the band back together

07:36.673 --> 07:38.327
and get that
son of a bitch Diaz.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.547
What's he want at the CDC?

07:40.590 --> 07:41.896
Finding that out is
the easy part.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.680
What's the hard part?

07:43.724 --> 07:46.204
Getting into the CDC.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.641
You heard the boss man.

07:47.684 --> 07:51.383
The only way we get in there
is with federal clearance.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.782
Where are all the guards?
What the hell is happening?

08:41.825 --> 08:43.044
No idea.

08:43.087 --> 08:47.831
Brick has something planned.
Just stay here.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.659
Where you going?

08:49.703 --> 08:51.574
I need to find someone.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.228
I'm gonna come.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.491
Hey, your cell is the safest
spot for you right now.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.188
With all these murdery
guys on the loose,

08:57.232 --> 08:59.539
I'm sticking right by your side.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.107
Fine.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.251
That's a lot of
firepower for a bank.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.688
They need it. Half of
Europe's criminal underworld

09:18.732 --> 09:20.298
funnels their money
through here.

09:20.342 --> 09:21.952
Guessing that's a shoot first,

09:21.996 --> 09:23.693
ask questions never
kind of bank?

09:23.737 --> 09:26.609
Which is why they can't find
out that we're with a.R.G.U.S.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.612
Oh. Which
they won't because of...

09:29.656 --> 09:31.135
This.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.790
I printed it to be completely
identical to the real one,

09:33.834 --> 09:35.705
except for
the nanotech-laced paint

09:35.749 --> 09:36.924
which allows us

09:36.967 --> 09:38.403
to access the bank's
financial transactions.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.971
Heh heh. That's
a Curtis holt original.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.973
I mean, come on.
That's pretty cool, right?

09:43.017 --> 09:44.932
Well, hopefully,
it's enough to fool 'em.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.803
Well, it only
needs to fool him...

09:46.847 --> 09:48.109
Peter tietjen.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.719
He is the bank manager.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.503
I have you an appointment
set up with him already.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.854
You get that painting within
5 feet of his computer

09:53.897 --> 09:55.682
and it is dinner party
download time at a.R.G.U.S.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.466
I'm talking
an all-you-can-eat buffet

09:57.509 --> 09:59.555
of every name, account,
shady business transaction

09:59.599 --> 10:01.122
that that bank
has ever conducted.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.690
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! While
you guys are in there,

10:03.733 --> 10:05.605
can you get me a free toaster?

10:10.218 --> 10:12.960
Mr. and Mrs. Andrews,
thank you for coming in.

10:13.003 --> 10:16.920
May I see your reference
letter, please?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.975
This is our reference letter.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.977
We need a safe place
to store it.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.675
We were told you
could handle this...

10:32.719 --> 10:35.635
Discreetly, of course.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.810
Of course.

10:36.853 --> 10:37.985
I think you will find our terms

10:38.028 --> 10:39.203
more than reasonable.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.641
That's it!
Show me the money.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.382
We have uplink.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.820
After signing
the requisite forms,

10:46.863 --> 10:48.386
all we require is

10:48.430 --> 10:50.650
an approval from
our in-house appraiser.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.652
If you'll excuse me.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.706
Tick-tock, Curtis.
What's our status?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.316
Zurich, we have a problem.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.666
I'm getting
external interference,

11:06.709 --> 11:08.842
and it's slowing down
the transfer.

11:11.888 --> 11:15.457
This is Sofie, our appraiser.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.028
Is this really necessary?

11:21.071 --> 11:22.769
We must authenticate the item

11:22.812 --> 11:24.553
for insurance purposes.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.163
You understand?

11:28.296 --> 11:31.647
Mr. Tietjen, this is
a priceless family heirloom.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.867
I need to discuss
the security of your vault.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.129
Certainly.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.870
We are very experienced

11:36.913 --> 11:38.436
with these types of situations.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.526
I'm shutting down come to
open bandwidth. Hang tight.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.748
Mr. Tietjen...

11:50.971 --> 11:53.582
Come on.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.062
Done! Get the hell
out of there.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.454
This is outrageous.

11:56.498 --> 11:59.022
We're taking our
business elsewhere.

12:04.114 --> 12:07.074
Mission accomplished.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.122
If this is illegal, I don't
want to know about it.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.125
Aw, d., why you always
got to expect the worst?

12:15.169 --> 12:17.258
You make it
easy, Mr. Ramirez.

12:17.301 --> 12:20.957
Ok, ok, what the
hell is going on here?

12:21.001 --> 12:21.915
We know how to get Diaz,

12:21.958 --> 12:23.830
and we need your help.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.093
I thought I made myself
clear, Ms. Smoak.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.008
You did. And then I figured out
how to set a trap at the CDC.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.444
- How did you know about this...
- I bugged your office.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.793
- See...
- I know. I know.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.490
But hold the lecture. We're
on a time crunch here.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.927
I backtraced
the silencer's hack.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.450
Wait. We're calling her
the silencer now?

12:35.493 --> 12:36.930
- It's better than the belt lady.
- Noted.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.366
She's been checking inventory

12:38.409 --> 12:40.020
on glutathione hydrate.

12:40.063 --> 12:43.110
It's a biocompound that helps
protect red blood cells

12:43.153 --> 12:44.328
against diseases like ebola

12:44.372 --> 12:45.677
and the lassa fever.

12:45.721 --> 12:46.896
I mean, god knows
what creepy thing

12:46.940 --> 12:48.202
Diaz has planned for that,

12:48.245 --> 12:49.856
and the only place
he can get it is

12:49.899 --> 12:51.379
the CDC.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.903
You do realize the CDC is
a secure government facility.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.992
They have strict
protocols, proce...

12:56.036 --> 12:57.864
which makes it the
perfect place, you know,

12:57.907 --> 12:59.387
to set a trap.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.693
The compound is being stored
in a biocontainment lab.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.695
Diaz walks in there,
I seal the doors...

13:04.696 --> 13:06.133
He's locked in.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.613
Like that zombie movie...
or any zombie movie.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.615
- And when is this happening?
- Tonight.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.095
A shipment just came
in from central city.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.967
Well, I'll put a team together.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.099
If Diaz goes near that building,
the scpd will be there waiting.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.536
If Diaz even gets a whiff of
the police, it'll spook him.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.451
Oh, right. You want
to do it the vigilante way.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.584
Well, you probably shouldn't
have invited her.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.630
No canary,
no wild dog. Just us.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.241
It technically wouldn't
be off the books

13:27.284 --> 13:28.546
if agent Watson comes with us.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.200
And go against my boss'
direct order

13:30.244 --> 13:31.767
to stay away from the CDC?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.595
Your boss is wrong,
and you know it.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.075
Besides, something tells
me if you brought Diaz in,

13:35.118 --> 13:36.250
all would be forgiven.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.295
That's a big "if."

13:38.339 --> 13:40.645
Diaz has been a plague on
this city and on our lives

13:40.689 --> 13:41.951
for too long.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.953
And now we have a chance
to bring him down.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.302
We have to take it.

13:45.346 --> 13:47.217
It's been 5 months.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.915
The scpd hasn't caught him,

13:48.958 --> 13:50.699
neither has the FBI,
neither has a.R.G.U.S.

13:50.742 --> 13:53.702
It's time to try another way.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.185
Fine.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.536
But this is a one-time
thing, understand?

14:01.579 --> 14:05.845
And if anything feels off,
I pull the plug.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.022
What do you say, d.?

14:10.719 --> 14:12.416
All right.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.071
Let's go catch us a dragon.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.424
This is like a horror movie.

14:20.468 --> 14:24.037
It's so quiet,
I can hear my heartbeat.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.517
I'm gonna be
the first one taken out.

14:26.561 --> 14:27.823
It would never be you.

14:27.867 --> 14:32.219
All right. If you're
gonna tag along,

14:32.262 --> 14:34.308
do it a little more quietly.

14:34.351 --> 14:38.181
Right. Ok.
There's 3-b.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.465
Not here!

15:01.509 --> 15:03.728
So what do we do, just wait?

15:03.772 --> 15:06.818
It'll be a long wait.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.865
Where's the demon?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.171
Hell if I know.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.044
You actually thought brick
was gonna help you?

15:15.088 --> 15:16.567
Well, brick got what he wanted,

15:16.611 --> 15:21.529
and now he wants you dead.

15:52.125 --> 15:56.694
You're not going anywhere
until I get some answers.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.575
We had a deal!

16:07.618 --> 16:09.359
A deal that means nothing

16:09.403 --> 16:11.448
now that brick
got what he wanted.

16:11.492 --> 16:14.016
With yorke gone, we're finally
free to have some fun.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.976
Brick's got a game going on
right now in the mess hall,

16:17.019 --> 16:19.239
all thanks to you.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.762
First rule of prison...

16:20.805 --> 16:21.806
trust no one.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.505
Ah, the kid's right.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.811
Now, how did he manage to
figure that out before you did?

16:26.855 --> 16:29.727
All right. So brick was
lying. There's no demon.

16:29.771 --> 16:33.253
Oh, there is, but you
don't summon the demon.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.602
The demon summons you.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.517
I think I'll take my chances.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.650
You're not getting this.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.740
The only way to the
demon is through brick.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.265
There's a system.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.267
That's how this place works.

16:47.310 --> 16:51.053
Well, looks like
I'm gonna force brick

16:51.097 --> 16:52.837
to make good on his deal.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.491
Hmm. Good luck.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.841
His party's invite only,

16:56.885 --> 17:00.106
and, uh, you're not on the list.

17:04.109 --> 17:07.156
I'm guessing you are.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.078
Good evening.
Samanda Watson, FBI.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.166
I'm here to pick up
some security abstracts.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.126
You're working late.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.692
Day got away from me.
You know how it is.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.173
Door to the right.
I'll buzz you in.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.139
The biocontainment lab
should be right here.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.705
This is it.

17:34.749 --> 17:38.100
So all we got to do
is trap them inside?

17:38.144 --> 17:39.319
That's the idea.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.190
There's a server
room down the hall.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.278
Felicity and I will
set up there.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.019
The camera's on a loop.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.194
As far as Diaz can tell,
the place will be empty.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.066
We'll cover the exits.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.158
This is quite the set-up.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.334
Well, the CDC takes their security
a lot more seriously than the FBI.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.162
No offense.

17:56.205 --> 17:59.643
None taken. You thought about
getting into cybersecurity legally?

17:59.687 --> 18:02.516
I haven't done legally
in a very long time.

18:02.559 --> 18:05.301
What scared you off? All
that nasty due process?

18:05.345 --> 18:07.303
You mean the rolls
and rolls of red tape?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.740
No, I just prefer to spend my
time actually catching criminals.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.786
I know the law isn't perfect.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.570
If it were, Diaz would be in
prison, William would be at home,

18:13.614 --> 18:15.355
and I wouldn't jump 5 feet
every time I hear a door slam,

18:15.398 --> 18:16.486
but here we are.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.574
Just because
the system is flawed

18:17.618 --> 18:19.228
doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.751
Even someone like Ricardo Diaz

18:20.795 --> 18:22.710
needs a lawyer, a fair trial.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.625
We protect the rights of
people who don't deserve them

18:24.668 --> 18:26.540
because it's the only way to
protect them for everyone.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.759
And yet here you are
tonight going off-book.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.414
Well, it's like you said before:

18:31.458 --> 18:33.373
As long as I cuff a bad guy,

18:33.416 --> 18:34.939
all is forgiven, right?

18:34.983 --> 18:38.029
And then we go get justice
the old-fashioned way...

18:38.073 --> 18:39.335
in court.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.337
Let's hope.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.340
Hey, is Lyla here?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.690
No. She stepped out.
What's up?

18:46.734 --> 18:48.997
Uh, nothing. Well,
ok. Something.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.913
Well, not something-something
necessarily

18:51.956 --> 18:54.568
but probably... Swiss chocolate?

18:54.611 --> 18:56.265
Heh! Chocolate
pralines.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.267
I mean, there's nothing better.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.790
- Curtis.
- Ok.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.314
Remember that interference

19:01.357 --> 19:02.271
that happened
during our download?

19:02.315 --> 19:03.707
Don't tell me you lost the data.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.361
Deputy director bell's
gonna be pissed.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.407
No. The opposite.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.365
I think someone duplicated
the file simultaneously

19:09.409 --> 19:11.062
as we downloaded it.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.064
That's impossible.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.110
The only ones who knew about
this op were me, you, and Lyla.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.373
Yeah. And judging from
your face, it wasn't you.

19:17.417 --> 19:22.378
It definitely wasn't me.
So that only leaves...?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.599
Why would Lyla make
a copy of that data?

19:25.642 --> 19:28.819
Maybe it's not
as shady as it seems.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.995
Why would she hide this from me?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.823
Sometimes secrets are
good in a marriage.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.390
You know, it keeps
the spice alive.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.652
Actually, don't
quote me on that.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.959
I'm actually divorced.
What are you gonna do?

19:38.002 --> 19:40.831
Find out why my wife
is lying to me.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.058
Where do you think they
keep the dead rats?

19:50.101 --> 19:51.625
So inhumane.

19:54.497 --> 19:55.977
I got eyes on Diaz,

19:56.020 --> 19:58.414
and he brought
two psychos with him.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.590
Any chance they left
the third one at home?

20:00.634 --> 20:04.855
It's doubtful. The silencer
wouldn't want to miss this.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.947
They've reached the lab.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.519
Hold up. The zombies
just walked right in,

20:16.563 --> 20:17.955
no key card or nothing.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.348
That doesn't make any sense.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.220
It doesn't matter.
Just lock the doors.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.962
Frak. Frak. Frak. Frak.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.834
Make better sounds, Felicity.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.270
Whatever's opening that door is
jamming my access frequencies.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.967
It's some sort of
Sonic disruption.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.491
The come are still working.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.579
Well, how about
I save the details

20:32.622 --> 20:33.971
of acoustic-injection
cyberattacks

20:34.015 --> 20:35.756
for post-mission happy hour?

20:35.799 --> 20:39.368
The silencer. She must've
brought a new toy.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.804
Can you turn it off?

20:40.848 --> 20:42.284
I can't hack it,
but I can track it.

20:42.328 --> 20:44.417
She's in the northeast corridor,

20:44.460 --> 20:46.288
headed towards
the mechanical room.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.812
I'm on it.
But once I catch up to her,

20:48.856 --> 20:51.946
it'll be radio silence,
literally.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.519
What my darts could do
with all this stuff!

20:59.562 --> 21:02.348
Yeah, if it doesn't
kill you first.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.919
I found it.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.058
Diaz is packing up.
We got to hurry.

21:17.101 --> 21:18.973
- Time for plan "b."
- No, no, no.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.541
That's a big old negative. Manual
overrides are in the basement.

21:21.584 --> 21:22.846
And, again, no locks, no entry.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.761
- I can't let Diaz escape.
- What are you, crazy?

21:24.805 --> 21:26.502
You can't beat them.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.025
I don't have to.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.549
I just got to keep them
in that room long enough

21:29.592 --> 21:31.899
for you to lock those doors.

21:33.596 --> 21:36.512
I'm in the mechanical room.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.667
A lot of things in that lab

22:00.710 --> 22:02.756
don't react nicely to gunfire.

22:02.799 --> 22:05.236
So one stray bullet,
and the whole place goes boom.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.373
FBI.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.201
Stop right there.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.811
Agent Watson,

22:14.855 --> 22:17.814
I see you're reunited
with some old friends.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.425
Step away from the cooler, Diaz,

22:19.468 --> 22:21.427
and put your hands in the air...

22:21.470 --> 22:22.558
Slowly.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.343
Can you please handle this?

22:26.127 --> 22:27.781
Errr.

22:36.485 --> 22:37.878
Hyah!

22:57.811 --> 23:01.597
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

23:23.706 --> 23:26.666
Play time's over.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.678
Let's go!

23:40.941 --> 23:43.683
The silencer's still here
in the mechanical room.

23:43.726 --> 23:46.642
I'll take Diaz.
You help dinah.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.486
This is gonna be fun.

24:11.537 --> 24:12.625
D.

24:12.668 --> 24:15.497
I'm fine.
Go! Go get her. Go!

24:18.544 --> 24:20.981
Diaz got away.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.465
- Rene, can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.901
The silencer's the only
lead we have on Diaz.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.947
We can't let her escape.

24:33.776 --> 24:37.127
The silencer got away.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.487
On a scale of
one to unemployment,

24:48.530 --> 24:49.966
how much trouble is she in?

24:50.010 --> 24:52.534
Well, she wasn't supposed to
be here in the first place;

24:52.578 --> 24:54.144
Diaz escaped with the compound;

24:54.188 --> 24:57.060
and we have no idea where or
how he's planning on using it.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.280
So a lot?

25:03.371 --> 25:05.547
Hey, Rene sure got out
of here in a hurry.

25:05.591 --> 25:06.766
Well, can you blame him?

25:06.809 --> 25:08.376
I mean, the FBI and him

25:08.419 --> 25:11.248
don't exactly have a
love-love relationship.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.513
How bad is it?

25:14.556 --> 25:15.818
What do you think?

25:15.862 --> 25:17.167
I mean, the silencer
was right there.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.865
I don't understand how he

25:18.908 --> 25:20.388
managed to let her slip past us.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.346
Rene must have missed
her by seconds.

25:22.390 --> 25:26.786
I have to go. My boss is
waiting for me at the office.

25:26.829 --> 25:29.745
Agent Watson...

25:31.617 --> 25:34.054
Thank you for trying.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.675
Brick's gonna be
extra pissed to see you.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.155
He thinks you're dead.

25:48.198 --> 25:50.766
Well, he's in for a surprise.

25:50.810 --> 25:51.985
Come on.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.596
What are we walking into?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.556
Brick will probably
have prisoners posted

25:57.599 --> 25:58.818
outside the mess hall.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.776
You talk us past them.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.387
And if you say one wrong word...

26:03.431 --> 26:05.781
yeah, slash goes the artery.
Yeah, I get it.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.697
You know, it's nice to know
that you'd shiv yourself

26:08.741 --> 26:11.787
to save some hardass guard

26:11.831 --> 26:13.833
but you have no problem
shivving me.

26:13.876 --> 26:17.010
Well, you ambushed me.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.795
You think I had
a choice in that?

26:19.839 --> 26:20.796
Brick calls the shots.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.798
If I don't try to kill you,

26:22.842 --> 26:24.800
then brick kills me.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.498
Every man here is
out for number one,

26:27.542 --> 26:29.022
including you.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.633
Everything I do is
for my family.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.854
You're just out for yourself.

26:39.032 --> 26:42.252
You think you know me so well.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.341
You know nothing about me.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.517
I know you made a deal
with China white

26:46.561 --> 26:48.041
to have me killed,

26:48.084 --> 26:50.260
and I know you helped
steal a weapon

26:50.304 --> 26:53.002
that blew up half the glades.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.831
What about markovia, 2014?

26:55.875 --> 26:58.442
A known terrorist
named gholem qadir.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.053
Or did you forget I was
part of the mission

27:00.096 --> 27:01.750
that helped bring him down?

27:01.794 --> 27:04.710
A.r.g.u.s. Put an explosive
in the back of your neck.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.668
You didn't have a choice.

27:06.712 --> 27:07.756
Oh, but I did have a choice

27:07.800 --> 27:09.802
to save your friend's life.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.065
Yeah. Lyla
and I were alone

27:12.108 --> 27:14.545
when qadir tried to
slit her throat,

27:14.589 --> 27:15.764
and I drove my blade

27:15.808 --> 27:17.418
right through his back.

27:17.461 --> 27:20.682
John never told me it was
you who saved her life.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.162
Yeah, why would he?

27:22.205 --> 27:25.644
You and your team only
saw me as one thing...

27:25.687 --> 27:27.210
the enemy.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.779
But now look at us,
both in prison.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.826
So I guess we're not
that different

27:33.869 --> 27:35.654
after all.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.502
You followed me.

27:58.546 --> 28:00.026
Well, I wouldn't have had
to if you had told me

28:00.069 --> 28:01.984
the real reason why
we're in Zurich, Lyla.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.552
- It's not what it looks like.
- Really? That's good.

28:04.595 --> 28:06.293
That's good, because
it looks like you

28:06.336 --> 28:07.773
just handed over sensitive
a.R.G.U.S. Intel

28:07.816 --> 28:09.557
to a criminal.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.211
I thought you'd have a little
more faith in me than that.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.517
I did until this very moment.

28:13.561 --> 28:18.958
Lyla, just tell me
what's going on...

28:19.001 --> 28:20.960
The truth.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.746
I caught wind of something...

28:24.790 --> 28:27.140
money changing hands that's...

28:27.183 --> 28:30.360
that's bigger than anything
we've been up against.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.754
I ran it up the chain but kept
getting stymied by the brass.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.060
Not enough evidence.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.626
What, so you're going
behind a.R.G.U.S.'S back?

28:35.670 --> 28:37.585
I didn't expect judgment
from someone

28:37.628 --> 28:39.587
who's spent so much time
delivering justice in the shadows.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.371
Oh, Lyla, that's not
what I'm saying.

28:41.415 --> 28:44.766
Listen to me, I just... i
just can't believe

28:44.810 --> 28:46.072
you would hide this from me.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.769
After everything
we've been through,

28:47.813 --> 28:49.379
I thought the one thing
we agreed on is that

28:49.423 --> 28:51.381
there will be no more
secrets between us.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.819
I was trying to protect you.

28:53.862 --> 28:55.864
I wasn't keeping secrets.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.824
You didn't want to take up
Oliver's mantle,

28:58.867 --> 29:00.782
and I respect that,

29:00.826 --> 29:02.915
but being the director
of a.R.G.U.S. Has shown me

29:02.958 --> 29:05.004
that there is far more evil in the
world than people willing to fight it.

29:05.047 --> 29:09.225
And I can't stand around
anymore and just watch.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.793
Johnny, sometimes you
have to cross the line

29:11.837 --> 29:13.577
for the greater good.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.756
I would expect you
to understand that.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.811
Two prisoners guarding
the mess hall door,

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
just like Turner said.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.990
You're up.

29:35.034 --> 29:39.995
Get me in there or else.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.485
Step aside, fellas.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.748
Green Arrow's joining
our little game.

29:53.792 --> 29:54.880
You kidding?

29:54.923 --> 29:56.838
We can't let Queen in here.

29:56.882 --> 30:00.624
You'd better. He's vip.

30:00.668 --> 30:04.063
The high rollers will be
very happy to see him.

30:07.501 --> 30:09.459
You're coming in there with me.

30:09.503 --> 30:13.028
Good. I'd hate
to miss all the fun.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.866
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

30:34.136 --> 30:36.486
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

30:36.530 --> 30:40.664
it seems we have an unexpected
treat for you this evening...

30:40.708 --> 30:43.276
an epic, once-in-a-lifetime
match-up:

30:43.319 --> 30:48.107
Our champion, Sampson,
versus the Green Arrow!

30:56.550 --> 30:59.727
I kind of wish we
stayed outside.

31:01.555 --> 31:05.733
No. I don't have
time for this.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.868
Where you going, Arrow?

31:16.135 --> 31:18.050
Oh, you're way tougher
than this guy.

31:18.093 --> 31:21.140
What do you say?
Time for a rematch?

31:21.183 --> 31:23.055
Last time didn't end
so well for you.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.709
This time, I'm gonna kill you.

31:25.753 --> 31:29.104
Gentlemen, place your bets.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.193
This is gonna be a hell
of a pay day.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.760
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

31:37.069 --> 31:39.462
Ow! Uh!

31:39.506 --> 31:41.638
That's it, Sampson. Hit him.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.653
You got this, Oliver!

31:56.697 --> 31:58.003
Yes!

32:23.202 --> 32:24.420
Yield!

32:24.464 --> 32:25.264
Never.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.079
That was awesome.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.733
What a performance.

32:32.776 --> 32:35.997
I'll let you in on a secret,
Queen.

32:36.041 --> 32:41.350
My money was on you.
You're a hard man to kill.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.402
Stand down!

32:57.366 --> 32:59.412
No more games.

32:59.455 --> 33:02.197
Tell me where to find the demon.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.026
Brick...

33:05.070 --> 33:07.986
Don't make me ask you again.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.468
I've had you running around,
playing fetch for me

33:12.512 --> 33:15.254
like my grandmother's
springer spaniel.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.038
And you know the best part?

33:17.082 --> 33:19.388
You'll never get to the demon,

33:19.432 --> 33:23.175
'cause you're on
the wrong level.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.654
The demon is on level 2,

33:24.698 --> 33:27.092
the place for the worst
of the worst.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.920
And that just isn't you now.

33:29.964 --> 33:33.054
Isn't that right, Arrow?

34:29.763 --> 34:33.984
Oliver, you got a plan, right?

34:34.027 --> 34:35.725
Stop worrying about me.

34:35.768 --> 34:38.989
Just try to keep your head down.

34:39.033 --> 34:42.775
Maybe level 2 isn't as bad
as everyone says.

34:42.819 --> 34:44.342
As long as it gives me
what I want,

34:44.386 --> 34:46.127
I don't care.

34:48.911 --> 34:51.871
You were never gonna be
able to stay a hero...

34:54.179 --> 34:56.572
Not in this place.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.104
Thanks for coming.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.193
I'm guessing you didn't
call me in to tell me

35:08.236 --> 35:09.542
you're getting promoted.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.631
Ha ha. I've been
reassigned.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.372
Desk jockey job
back in D.C.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.548
And I'm guessing that new
gig takes you far away

35:15.591 --> 35:17.245
from the Diaz investigation.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.117
That's the idea.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.597
I hope you're not
expecting me to apologize.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.947
I'm not. I knew I was putting
my career on the line

35:23.991 --> 35:26.341
when I agreed to work
with you and your team.

35:27.821 --> 35:29.605
I believe that good
law enforcement

35:29.649 --> 35:31.216
does make up for the bad,

35:31.259 --> 35:32.739
and I always will.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.219
But going off the books
to catch Diaz?

35:34.262 --> 35:36.134
That was the right thing to do.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.968
You don't deserve to live
without your family.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.406
You're a good person, Felicity.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.625
Hmm.

35:49.669 --> 35:53.412
I never thought I'd hear
myself say this,

35:53.455 --> 35:56.328
but I'm very sorry to see
you go, agent Watson.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.547
I'm sorry Diaz
and his crew got away.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.419
I mean, things would've
turned out different

36:00.462 --> 36:02.421
if we'd gotten at least something
on that son of a bitch.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.597
I know. I know.
I'm with you.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.122
Square one sucks.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.216
You ready?

36:15.260 --> 36:18.219
To get home to j.J. And out
of this hotel room? Yes.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.742
Can we talk first?

36:19.786 --> 36:22.223
- Talk or lecture?
- Lyla, I'm sorry.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.357
I was wrong.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.058
I should've given you the chance

36:31.101 --> 36:32.929
to explain yourself
before accusing you

36:32.973 --> 36:34.844
of being something
that you are not.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.238
I know things have
been hard for you

36:37.282 --> 36:40.241
with Oliver gone, but
you have to trust me.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.112
I do trust you,

36:42.156 --> 36:44.202
but, Lyla, all of this,

36:44.245 --> 36:47.466
it's so dangerous.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.250
I think of j.J.

36:49.294 --> 36:53.472
So do I, which is why I
can't turn my back on this.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.389
You were right.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.654
Sometimes you do have
to cross the line.

37:01.697 --> 37:05.266
Just promise me, next time

37:05.310 --> 37:07.660
something like this happens...

37:10.271 --> 37:12.273
Let me in.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.451
I promise.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.940
This was a bad idea.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.334
We didn't have a choice.

37:29.377 --> 37:31.466
Listen, I'm not a super
fan of agent Watson,

37:31.510 --> 37:32.380
but we got her in trouble.

37:32.424 --> 37:33.990
We didn't make her do anything.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.775
We've been sitting and waiting

37:35.818 --> 37:37.472
for the law to catch
Diaz for months.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.995
I am tired of waiting.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.519
I get that, but...

37:40.562 --> 37:42.085
isn't this kind of what we've
been doing the whole time,

37:42.129 --> 37:43.304
stepping in when
the system fails?

37:43.348 --> 37:45.480
Isn't that sort of
a vigilante m.O.?

37:45.524 --> 37:47.221
Sometimes you have to
cross the line for that.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.919
Listen, nobody believes
in that more than me.

37:49.963 --> 37:52.922
I'm just not sure that's
what this is.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.726
They got honor.

38:13.769 --> 38:17.338
She's a big girl. She can
take care of herself.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.168
Ever since I was blown
off that roof...

38:23.388 --> 38:28.349
All I've felt is pain...

38:30.351 --> 38:31.700
The pain of betrayal,

38:31.744 --> 38:37.750
the pain of having every
bone in my body shattered...

38:39.621 --> 38:41.841
When I hit the water.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.540
But I didn't panic.

38:47.499 --> 38:50.415
I was patient.

38:54.549 --> 38:57.335
And that patience

38:57.378 --> 39:02.252
helped me to find a way
to transform that pain...

39:03.428 --> 39:05.560
Into something else.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.013
Aha! Huh!

39:34.676 --> 39:36.591
Strength.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.477
Let's go, 4587.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.609
You're going downstairs.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.853
Have fun down there.

40:20.896 --> 40:24.378
I hear the only way out of
level 2 is through the morgue.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.063
Greg, move your head!
