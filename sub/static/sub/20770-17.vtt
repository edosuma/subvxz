WEBVTT

01:49.693 --> 01:51.153
You okay, Gordon?

01:51.278 --> 01:52.905
I couldn't do it, Albert.

01:53.572 --> 01:54.657
I couldn't do it.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.117
You've gone soft
in your old age.

01:56.242 --> 01:57.201
What?

01:57.326 --> 02:01.038
I said, "You've gone soft
in your old age."

02:02.498 --> 02:04.125
Not where it counts, buddy.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.420
Here's to the bureau.

02:08.546 --> 02:10.214
- To the bureau.
- To the bureau.

02:18.764 --> 02:19.932
Now listen to me.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.407
For 25 years,

02:36.532 --> 02:38.450
I've kept something
from you, Albert.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.583
Before he disappeared,

02:45.708 --> 02:50.045
Major Briggs
shared with me and Cooper

02:50.171 --> 02:52.715
his discovery of an entity,

02:52.840 --> 02:56.135
an extreme negative force

02:56.260 --> 02:59.638
called in olden times
"Jowday."

03:00.973 --> 03:04.810
Over time,
it's become "Judy."

03:07.188 --> 03:10.774
Major Briggs, Cooper, and I
put together a plan

03:10.900 --> 03:12.568
that could lead us to Judy.

03:14.069 --> 03:18.199
And then something happened
to Major Briggs,

03:18.324 --> 03:20.201
and something happened
to Cooper.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.996
Phillip Jeffries,

03:24.121 --> 03:26.081
who doesn't really
exist anymore,

03:26.207 --> 03:28.751
at least not
in the normal sense,

03:28.876 --> 03:31.128
told me a long time ago

03:31.253 --> 03:33.172
he was onto this entity,

03:33.297 --> 03:34.840
and he disappeared.

03:36.175 --> 03:40.512
Now, the last thing
Cooper told me was...

03:40.638 --> 03:45.184
"If I disappear
like the others,

03:45.309 --> 03:47.561
do everything you can
to find me.

03:48.771 --> 03:51.982
I'm trying to kill
two birds with one stone."

03:54.568 --> 03:58.113
And now this thing
of two Coopers.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.870
And recently,

04:04.995 --> 04:07.122
a paid informant

04:07.248 --> 04:09.291
named Ray Monroe

04:09.416 --> 04:12.002
sent a cryptic message

04:12.127 --> 04:16.257
indicating that
the Cooper we met at prison

04:16.382 --> 04:18.968
is looking for coordinates,

04:19.093 --> 04:24.098
coordinates from
a certain Major Briggs.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.484
This plan, Albert,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.319
I couldn't tell you about,

04:37.444 --> 04:39.113
and I'm sorry.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.657
I understand.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.534
I know you understand, Albert,

04:43.659 --> 04:45.202
yet I'm still sorry.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.665
And I don't know at all
if this plan is unfolding properly

04:49.790 --> 04:51.583
'cause we should have
heard by now

04:51.709 --> 04:53.335
from our dear Dale Cooper.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.259
This is Cole.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.510
<i>Agent Headley here, sir.</i>

05:01.635 --> 05:03.053
We found him.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.638
We found Douglas Jones.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.933
<i>But...
we don't know where he is.</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:11.145
Has my watch stopped, or is that
one of the Marx Brothers?

05:11.270 --> 05:13.939
What the hell does
that mean, Headley?

05:14.064 --> 05:15.357
The bed is empty.

05:16.442 --> 05:19.111
My team is sending
everything to you as we speak.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.864
<i>Director Cole,
we got it all</i>‒

05:21.989 --> 05:23.073
the whole story.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.159
Is that Gordon Cole
on the phone?

05:25.284 --> 05:26.243
Yes, it is.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.911
- Why?
- I have a message for him.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.122
A message from Dougie.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.206
What's that?

05:31.332 --> 05:32.374
What's that?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.960
Uh, there's a man here‒
he says he has a message

05:35.085 --> 05:36.587
<i>for you from Douglas Jones.</i>

05:36.712 --> 05:37.963
Well, give it to me.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.885
Am I talking
to Mr. Gordon Cole?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.303
Yes, you are.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.597
<i>Well, Dougie
wanted me to read you this</i>‒

05:46.722 --> 05:48.766
"I am headed

05:48.891 --> 05:50.726
for Sheriff Truman's.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.980
<i>It is 2:53 in Las Vegas,</i>

05:55.105 --> 05:58.275
and that adds up to a ten,

05:58.400 --> 06:00.861
the number of completion."

06:00.986 --> 06:02.237
That's all he wrote.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.281
And what is your name, sir?

06:04.406 --> 06:05.574
<i>Bushnell Mullins.</i>

06:05.699 --> 06:07.910
Lucky 7 Insurance.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.370
I'm his boss.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.246
Thank you, Mr. Mullins.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.248
Thank you very much.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.833
And that makes two of us.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.256
Dougie is Cooper?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.926
How the hell is this?

06:28.180 --> 06:30.391
They blew up
Dougie Jones' car.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.433
Then a notorious hit man

06:31.558 --> 06:33.852
tried to shoot him
outside his place of business.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.397
He's been spotted
in the company

06:36.522 --> 06:38.649
of two
organized-crime figures.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.071
He electrocuted himself
by sticking a fork...

06:44.196 --> 06:45.572
in a wall socket.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.075
That's strange,
even for Cooper.

06:48.951 --> 06:52.579
A Blue Rose case,
most definitely.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.042
He was hospitalized in a coma
until earlier this afternoon.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.131
Pack it up!
I know where he's going.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.453
Finally.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.682
You fucker.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.684
Fucker.

07:56.768 --> 07:57.769
Fuck you.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.606
Fuck you.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.241
What the hell is that?

08:52.366 --> 08:53.825
No clue, mate.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.494
No clue, mate.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.740
Wyoming?

09:33.865 --> 09:34.866
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

09:35.742 --> 09:37.369
<i>Is your name Ben?</i>

09:37.494 --> 09:38.662
Yes.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.455
<i>Got a guy here</i>‒

09:40.581 --> 09:43.625
<i>no identification,
won't give his name,</i>

09:43.750 --> 09:45.794
<i>says he's your brother.</i>

09:45.919 --> 09:48.422
<i>Says his binoculars
killed somebody.</i>

09:49.923 --> 09:53.135
That's my brother,
Jerry Horne.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.886
Is he charged with anything?

09:56.013 --> 09:57.055
<i>No.</i>

09:58.265 --> 10:00.517
I'll make arrangements
to get him home.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.060
What's your name again?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.980
<i>Sergeant Williams,
Jackson Hole Police.</i>

10:08.358 --> 10:10.152
<i>And you can send clothes.</i>

10:10.277 --> 10:13.280
<i>When we picked him up,
he was completely naked.</i>

10:14.656 --> 10:16.241
<i>Have a good day, sir.</i>

14:57.606 --> 14:58.940
What is this?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.918
Agent Cooper,

15:18.043 --> 15:19.294
is that you?

15:20.503 --> 15:22.380
Agent Cooper,

15:22.505 --> 15:23.924
it is you.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.176
We were just talking
about you.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.677
Hello, Andy.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.195
What's going on?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.281
I think she's trying
to say something.

16:36.997 --> 16:40.166
Everyone's gonna be
so happy to see you.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.168
And I would like
to see them too.

16:42.293 --> 16:43.253
Come on in.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.588
I was just taking
this picnic basket in.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.382
We'll make
a fresh pot of coffee.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.387
Lucy.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.389
Lucy, look who's here.

16:55.765 --> 16:58.393
- Agent Cooper!
- Hello, Lucy.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.854
We were just
talking about you.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.522
So I understand.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.859
Sheriff Truman, this is
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.653
We haven't seen him
since before Wally was born.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.114
Sheriff Truman?

17:11.239 --> 17:12.449
I'm...

17:12.574 --> 17:14.743
Sheriff Frank Truman,
Harry's brother.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.789
- Sheriff.
- Nice to meet you.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.751
Come into the office
and sit down.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.241
Andy?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.538
Have a seat, Agent Cooper.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.048
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.301
No, thanks.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.511
I'm all right.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.849
Okay. I'm going to go
tell Hawk you're here.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.656
Cooper.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.661
Cooper.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.373
In the flesh.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.556
Very important.
Very important.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.633
Hawk,
are you down here?

20:16.758 --> 20:18.384
Hey.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.473
If it isn't the great,

20:23.598 --> 20:26.434
good cop, Deputy Andy...

20:26.559 --> 20:29.354
Great, good cop, Deputy Andy.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.273
...come to save the day.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.775
Come to save the day.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.820
You are such a pussy, Andy!

20:37.946 --> 20:39.906
You're a pussy, Andy.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.532
See how you like this,

20:41.658 --> 20:42.575
right between‒

21:05.515 --> 21:08.268
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.
This is Lucy speaking.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.855
Who?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.652
What brings you back
to Twin Peaks,

21:17.777 --> 21:18.987
Agent Cooper?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.407
Unfinished business.

21:22.532 --> 21:23.908
<i>Sheriff Truman?</i>

21:24.033 --> 21:25.285
Yes, Lucy?

21:25.410 --> 21:27.829
<i>There's a phone call
for you on line two,</i>

21:27.954 --> 21:29.747
<i>the blinking light.</i>

21:29.872 --> 21:31.958
Take a message, please, Lucy.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.670
<i>It's a very important
phone call, Sheriff.</i>

21:35.795 --> 21:37.338
All right, Lucy.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.549
Sorry, Agent Cooper.

21:42.802 --> 21:43.845
This is Truman.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.638
Harry, it's Coop.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.851
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.105
This is Frank Truman,
Harry's brother.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.026
Where are you?

21:58.151 --> 22:00.361
We're just entering
Twin Peaks city limits.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.529
Is the coffee on?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.627
What was that?

22:26.637 --> 22:27.680
Lucy.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.644
I've got to get
you all upstairs.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.614
I think this one's dead,
Agent Cooper.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.033
Don't touch him!
Stay away from that body.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.216
Andy...

23:04.801 --> 23:07.595
...I understand
cellular phones now.

23:25.113 --> 23:25.947
What the hell?

23:26.072 --> 23:28.783
Agent Cooper said
don't touch that body.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.956
But that is Agent Cooper.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.082
No...

23:38.376 --> 23:39.544
...it's not.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.731
Andy, where is he?

24:41.856 --> 24:42.899
In here.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.728
Oi!

26:10.152 --> 26:11.445
Are you Freddie?

26:11.571 --> 26:12.488
That's right.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.701
And this is me destiny.

26:35.386 --> 26:36.345
Freddie!

27:50.252 --> 27:51.212
Freddie, get up!

28:02.890 --> 28:04.558
Catch you...

28:04.684 --> 28:07.561
with my death bag.

28:32.670 --> 28:33.796
Did I do it?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.173
You did it, Freddie.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.474
One for the grandkids.

29:37.193 --> 29:40.279
Frank, do you have the room key
to the Great Northern Hotel,

29:40.404 --> 29:41.614
315?

29:41.739 --> 29:43.199
What?

29:43.324 --> 29:44.825
How do you know about‒

29:44.950 --> 29:45.951
Major Briggs told me

29:46.076 --> 29:48.120
Sheriff Truman would have it.

30:27.618 --> 30:28.661
What's going on around here?

30:30.830 --> 30:33.833
Took the fucking words
right out of my mouth.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.001
Major Garland Briggs.

30:39.213 --> 30:40.798
Bobby, your father
was well aware

30:40.923 --> 30:42.341
of what's going on here today.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.221
What <i>is</i> going on?

30:48.848 --> 30:52.643
Many years ago,
information your father gathered

30:52.768 --> 30:55.771
brought him together
with Director Gordon Cole,

30:55.896 --> 30:58.274
who is here right on time.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.277
Gordon.

31:01.402 --> 31:02.278
Coop.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.160
And that's what's brought us
to where we are today.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.835
Now, there are some things
that will change.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.926
The past dictates the future.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.889
Come on.

31:37.730 --> 31:41.150
It's a good thing
we made so many sandwiches.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.574
Frank...

31:50.075 --> 31:51.911
...give my regards to Harry.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.538
Sure will.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.661
Diane.

33:55.159 --> 33:56.452
Cooper...

33:57.828 --> 33:59.705
...the one and only.

34:03.751 --> 34:05.419
Do you remember everything?

34:08.839 --> 34:09.882
Yes.

34:38.494 --> 34:41.205
We live inside a dream.

34:44.208 --> 34:46.585
I hope I see all of you again...

34:48.712 --> 34:49.880
...every one of you.

35:01.725 --> 35:02.559
Gordon!

35:02.684 --> 35:03.602
Coop!

36:28.604 --> 36:31.565
Now, listen,
I'm going through this door.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.026
Don't try to follow me,
either of you.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.002
Be thinking of you, Coop.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.688
See you at the curtain call.

37:43.345 --> 37:47.140
Through the darkness
of future past,

37:47.266 --> 37:50.435
the magician longs to see.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.649
One chants out

37:55.774 --> 37:58.986
between two worlds...

37:59.111 --> 38:00.696
"Fire...

38:00.821 --> 38:03.699
walk with me."

40:25.757 --> 40:26.800
Phillip?

40:38.687 --> 40:42.566
<i>Please, be specific.</i>

40:45.735 --> 40:47.487
The date‒

40:47.612 --> 40:50.449
February 23, 1989.

40:53.618 --> 40:55.370
<i>I'll find it for you.</i>

40:58.331 --> 41:00.625
<i>It's slippery in here.</i>

41:03.420 --> 41:06.798
<i>It's good to see you again,
Cooper.</i>

41:09.801 --> 41:12.929
<i>Say hello to Gordon
if you see him.</i>

41:13.054 --> 41:15.682
<i>He'll remember
the unofficial version.</i>

41:17.684 --> 41:19.186
<i>This...</i>

41:19.311 --> 41:21.688
<i>is where you'll find Judy.</i>

41:32.991 --> 41:35.160
<i>There may be someone...</i>

41:39.414 --> 41:42.334
<i>Did you ask me this?</i>

42:30.423 --> 42:31.883
<i>There it is.</i>

42:34.719 --> 42:37.097
<i>You can go in now.</i>

42:40.350 --> 42:41.268
<i>Cooper...</i>

42:42.352 --> 42:43.353
<i>...remember.</i>

42:45.397 --> 42:49.442
Electricity.

44:06.853 --> 44:08.563
What is wrong with you?

44:08.688 --> 44:10.815
There's no place left to go,

44:10.940 --> 44:12.233
is there, James?

44:14.819 --> 44:16.946
Say whatever you want.

44:17.072 --> 44:19.032
I know you love me.

44:21.409 --> 44:22.494
And I love you.

44:24.996 --> 44:26.998
I do love you, James.

44:29.751 --> 44:32.337
Let's get lost together.

44:46.768 --> 44:47.644
Shit.

44:47.769 --> 44:48.978
What?

44:49.104 --> 44:51.022
He might try to kill you.

45:00.365 --> 45:01.491
What's wrong?

45:03.952 --> 45:04.869
What?

45:06.371 --> 45:08.540
If he finds out...

45:10.500 --> 45:11.835
Laura, what's the matter?

45:16.923 --> 45:19.050
Bobby killed a guy.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.387
What are you talking about?

45:22.512 --> 45:24.389
Bobby didn't kill anybody.

45:26.433 --> 45:27.559
Do you want to see?

45:28.810 --> 45:29.728
See what?

45:32.856 --> 45:34.190
Right.

45:37.652 --> 45:40.613
Open your eyes, James.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.414
You don't even know me.

45:50.999 --> 45:53.334
There are things about me...

45:55.670 --> 45:58.089
Even Donna doesn't know me.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.607
Your Laura disappeared.

46:27.786 --> 46:29.287
It's just me now.

46:35.335 --> 46:37.295
Laura.

46:43.843 --> 46:45.470
What about this, James?

47:05.281 --> 47:07.283
I think you want
to take me home now.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.009
Laura!

47:25.134 --> 47:27.095
Don't!

47:27.220 --> 47:29.222
Come on!

47:29.347 --> 47:31.140
Don't!

47:31.266 --> 47:33.768
Just don't!

47:35.979 --> 47:37.480
Oh!

47:37.605 --> 47:40.233
I love you, James!

49:02.649 --> 49:03.900
Who are you?

49:09.781 --> 49:11.157
Do I know you?

49:19.832 --> 49:20.917
Wait.

49:25.672 --> 49:28.174
I've seen you in a dream.

49:33.972 --> 49:35.264
In a dream.

50:55.803 --> 50:57.221
Where are we going?

51:01.684 --> 51:03.352
We're going home.

51:43.476 --> 51:44.977
Going fishing.
