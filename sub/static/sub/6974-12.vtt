00:42.208 --> 00:43.698
Get going.

00:47.614 --> 00:50.606
- Please.
- Do your damn job.

01:13.339 --> 01:18.174
You can't think Milli Vanilli is cool.
l would disown you.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.338
You are unbelievable.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.382
OK, l may puke, but l have to ask.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.946
Which one do you intend to marry?
Rob or Fab?

01:33.159 --> 01:35.423
Janet, get that.

01:39.199 --> 01:43.067
Hang on. l'm, like, the servant around here.

01:45.738 --> 01:48.639
- Yeah?
- Triboro Cable.

01:50.076 --> 01:52.306
What do you want?

01:54.414 --> 01:56.780
Your cable's out.

01:57.016 --> 01:59.507
ls it? l don't think so.

02:03.156 --> 02:04.680
OK. l'm sorry.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.493
Wait a sec.

02:08.561 --> 02:12.588
Maybe my dad called you.
You'd better come in.

02:16.569 --> 02:20.596
TV's in here.
Dad! Cable guy's here.

02:36.055 --> 02:38.990
Can l help you?

02:40.727 --> 02:43.560
There's a problem with your cable?

02:43.663 --> 02:47.099
l was just watching the game upstairs.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.999
l think you got the wrong house, buddy.

02:53.239 --> 02:56.003
ls that your work order?

02:59.245 --> 03:01.509
Who called it in?

03:46.125 --> 03:48.389
Police! Don't move.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.393
God Almighty.

03:53.466 --> 03:56.162
Face the wall. Face the wall.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.966
Johnny. Check the other rooms.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.206
They're all dead.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.621
Got you.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.095
Got you, you bastard.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.482
..g-g-e-t-t. Two G's and two T's.
l was the arresting officer.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.952
You're makin' a huge mistake.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.590
l don't care what it shows.

05:27.460 --> 05:31.988
l appreciate that. But l don't care
what it shows. lt's wrong.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.296
- l was there. We got the right guy.
- An X-File?

05:40.673 --> 05:44.473
l'm tellin' you, you let this guy go,
more people are gonna die.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.176
Was that the DA?

05:49.248 --> 05:52.979
Assistant DA. He was probably
in ninth grade when this happened.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.020
What do you want him to do?

05:55.088 --> 05:58.319
Keep the bastard locked up.
Did you read that?

05:58.391 --> 06:02.020
My partner and l busted
this guy, Fassl, 13 years ago.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.030
He'd killed seven people.
Now they wanna let him go.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.464
The DNA evidence proves he's innocent.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.435
lt's wrong. lt's some lab mistake.
Simple as that.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.169
My partner, Duke, and l catch this 911.

06:16.242 --> 06:19.336
Neighbors hearin' screaming
coming from this house.

06:19.412 --> 06:24.008
We get there. Teenage girl,
mother, father - all dead.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.313
There's blood...

06:28.988 --> 06:32.287
l can still remember the blood
squishing under my shoes.

06:32.358 --> 06:35.691
This guy Fassl's just standing there.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.692
So you didn't actually catch him in the act?

06:38.931 --> 06:43.334
Ten seconds earlier through the door
and we would have.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.169
Tell me you got good news.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.674
l have combed through
every detail of this ME's report.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.072
l have read and reread it.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.241
l am sorry, Agent Doggett,

06:58.317 --> 07:02.219
but the DNA fingerprinting
does indeed exonerate this man.

07:02.288 --> 07:07.555
You're telling me there's not a million-to-one
chance that these DNA tests are wrong?

07:07.627 --> 07:09.652
Actually 100 million.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.131
l need you to run the reports again yourself.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.067
Agent Doggett, you don't...

07:21.374 --> 07:24.639
- lt'd take at least 48 hours.
- That's too long.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.171
- Where are you going?
- New York.

07:30.249 --> 07:34.379
l can'tjust sit here
and wait for this guy to kill again.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.584
John...

07:37.690 --> 07:42.127
Look, l get it. Enough people tell you
you're drunk, it's time to lie down.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.686
But l know what l know.

07:45.598 --> 07:48.396
l could really use your help.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.948
lt's time to go.

08:26.639 --> 08:30.939
Congratulations, Bob. Best of luck to you.

09:10.449 --> 09:14.283
- How does it feel to be a free man?
- Are you gonna sue the police?

09:14.387 --> 09:18.687
lt goes without saying that my client
is happy once more to be a free man.

09:18.925 --> 09:23.191
l myself am overjoyed.
l think today is a day to celebrate.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.321
But tomorrow we will be looking closely

09:25.398 --> 09:29.459
at the reasons why Bob was
falsely accused and incarcerated.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.231
13 years of his life were stolen from him.

09:32.305 --> 09:37.436
We'll be looking at the Brooklyn DA's office
and the New York City Police Department.

09:48.988 --> 09:51.047
Bob, let's get you outta here.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.182
Thank you. Thank you.

09:58.331 --> 10:02.495
On top of springing loose a murderer,
the city of New York is gonna pay him off?

10:02.568 --> 10:05.002
Hell, yes. And count ourselves lucky.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.972
We didn't spring a murderer.
He's an innocent man.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.032
Or maybe you didn't glean that
from our conversation.

10:11.143 --> 10:14.237
Mr Kailer, on the off chance
that that's not true,

10:14.313 --> 10:18.215
why not let us look through
your documents pertaining to this case?

10:18.284 --> 10:21.048
Maybe we can save the city
some settlement money.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.284
Or maybe l get in an even biggerjackpot
when Jana Fain cries ''police vendetta'',

10:25.358 --> 10:30.022
yelling at the papers about the disgruntled
former cop who's out to get her client.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.587
Somebody committed these murders, right?

10:32.665 --> 10:35.293
Now that you've sprung Mr Bob Fassl,

10:35.368 --> 10:39.168
the victims' families
are gonna start askin' who.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.468
How you gonna answer 'em?

10:56.288 --> 10:59.018
There's a lot of material here.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.418
Where shall we start?

11:03.129 --> 11:07.190
Right there. The original arrest report.

11:10.936 --> 11:14.099
''Arresting officer: John Doggett.''

11:15.675 --> 11:18.075
Must have been a career-maker.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.944
Well, it didn't hurt when l put in for detective.

11:23.382 --> 11:27.148
The murders had been
front-page news for weeks.

11:27.219 --> 11:31.519
The sense of relief everybody felt
when we caught Fassl, it was...

11:33.592 --> 11:35.651
You know, John...

11:37.129 --> 11:40.292
whatever we find here, sometimes...

11:41.333 --> 11:44.962
Sometimes even good cops make mistakes.

11:49.075 --> 11:51.009
Yeah.

11:51.077 --> 11:55.639
And l've made more than l can count,
but this wasn't one of 'em.

11:57.016 --> 12:01.680
Whatever you think...
l'm not here trying to cover my ass.

12:01.754 --> 12:05.520
That's not what l think. lt's not. l just...

12:05.591 --> 12:09.584
l just worry that maybe this is
about you feeling guilty.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.926
l feel guilty...

12:11.997 --> 12:14.591
Like what, subconsciously?

12:14.667 --> 12:20.037
Like l was told l sent an innocent man
to prison, only l refuse to accept it?

12:24.343 --> 12:28.677
A cop l know, a man l respect deeply,
told me one time:

12:28.948 --> 12:33.009
''You don't clock out after your shift
unless you did everything you could.''

12:33.085 --> 12:37.112
That's what this is about. Me not clocking out.

12:53.706 --> 12:59.235
Bob, l want you to make yourself at home
while you're here. Just relax.

13:00.179 --> 13:04.707
Oh! Mrs Dowdy, this is Bob Fassl.
He'll be staying with us for a while.

13:04.950 --> 13:09.080
l have your room all made up.
l hope you'll be quite comfortable.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.321
Thank you very much, Mrs Dowdy.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.457
You're rich.

13:20.566 --> 13:24.730
Well, my parents were.
l inherited this when they died.

13:24.970 --> 13:29.703
l've been very fortunate, so l try and use
my family's resources to help where l can.

13:30.276 --> 13:34.440
You do good things. You're a good person.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.674
l guess it takes one to know one.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.984
l know some business people
sympathetic to your situation.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.582
When you're ready
we'll set up some job interviews.

13:57.369 --> 14:01.738
l can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

14:05.311 --> 14:11.511
l'm so sorry for everything you've been
through. And l'm so happy for you now.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.601
Hey, buddy. You steal that car?

15:14.213 --> 15:16.272
lf it ain't the FBl!

15:19.952 --> 15:22.352
Duke Tomasick. Lookin' good.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.948
Hell, yeah. l was always the pretty one.

15:27.660 --> 15:32.029
Not that l'd steal you away from
even one minute of retirement,

15:32.097 --> 15:36.193
but l gotta get another viewpoint on this case
from someone who was there.

15:36.268 --> 15:40.671
Duke, l'm racking my brain on this and
l'm coming at it from every possible angle.

15:40.739 --> 15:46.006
- Was there something we missed?
- Well, yeah. We arrested the wrong man.

15:46.078 --> 15:48.444
l'm sorry, John. l've been torn up about this,

15:48.514 --> 15:51.312
but unless there's something
you know that l don't,

15:51.383 --> 15:53.681
it looks like we gotta face facts.

15:53.752 --> 15:59.247
Duke, you were there. Fassl was the only one
in the house. He killed those people.

15:59.325 --> 16:02.089
John, wise up, will ya? Drop this thing.

16:03.662 --> 16:07.359
What did you always tell me
about being a good cop?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.594
You said never to clock out.

16:09.668 --> 16:12.296
Well, l got another lesson for ya.

16:12.371 --> 16:16.239
Keep after this thing,
it's gonna bite you in your ass.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.636
l'm sorry. l just wanted
to see how you were settling in.

16:50.709 --> 16:52.939
l should have knocked.

16:54.713 --> 17:01.118
l'd read in your file that you had attended
the seminary, that you studied to be a priest.

17:01.186 --> 17:05.349
lt's wonderful that all you've been through
hasn't diminished your faith.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.188
l pray all the time.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.627
l pray even when it looks like l'm not praying.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.494
l know someone's listening, Bob.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.465
Good night.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.369
No...

17:26.145 --> 17:27.169
Don't.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.510
Please don't hurt her. Please!

18:12.324 --> 18:14.918
Were you here all night?

18:16.662 --> 18:20.029
There's gotta be something here
that's been overlooked,

18:20.099 --> 18:24.195
something l can hang this guy with,
DNA or no.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.533
Speaking of DNA...

18:28.307 --> 18:30.172
Oh, come on.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.041
The retests of the typing
confirm the original results,

18:34.113 --> 18:39.278
that the hair samples do indeed belong
to someone other than Robert Fassl.

18:41.153 --> 18:43.348
So what do we do? We just go home?

18:43.422 --> 18:47.017
- This is wrong. This is...
- John, there is something else.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.253
Something that explains why 13 years ago

18:49.328 --> 18:52.661
the science of the day
identified the hair as Fassl's.

18:52.731 --> 18:56.030
l spoke to the forensic examiner
who ran the tests.

18:56.101 --> 19:00.367
He found a match in 12 of the 13 key genes.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.140
What does that mean?

19:02.207 --> 19:08.112
lt means that the mitochondrial DNA in the
hair sample is genetically similar to Fassl's.

19:08.180 --> 19:11.081
ln fact it is remarkably similar.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.449
lt is so similar that it must be
from a blood relative.

19:15.654 --> 19:20.114
Wait a minute. Fassl's an only child.
His parents died when he was 13.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.456
- He's got nobody.
- l know.

19:22.528 --> 19:27.363
You know? Then you know
that what you're saying is impossible.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.425
And yet somehow it's true.

19:53.392 --> 19:57.954
Would you get dressed
and come on downstairs, please?

20:09.007 --> 20:11.441
Bob...

20:11.510 --> 20:14.946
This morning l noticed something
that l must talk to you about.

20:15.013 --> 20:20.178
The drawers in my bedroom had been opened
and somebody had been through my things.

20:21.753 --> 20:25.154
- You weren't home last night?
- l think you know that l wasn't.

20:25.224 --> 20:30.093
As it happens, l was called down to
county lockup on behalf of another client.

20:30.162 --> 20:35.259
lf you're going to stay here, you have to
respect me, my privacy, my possessions.

20:36.401 --> 20:41.566
You're a free man now,
and with freedom comes responsibility.

20:43.775 --> 20:46.209
l am late for a deposition.

20:48.247 --> 20:54.447
Help yourself to breakfast. Mrs Dowdy
seems to be running late this morning.

22:09.294 --> 22:13.128
Agent Reyes, l'm Brian Hutchinson,
superintendent.

22:13.198 --> 22:16.964
- l appreciate you seeing me.
- Anything l can do to help.

22:17.035 --> 22:20.061
Great. l'm reviewing evidence
in the Fassl case.

22:20.138 --> 22:25.667
Whatever l can do to ensure he gets locked
back up again. Tell me what you need.

22:25.744 --> 22:31.341
Thank you. That's an extremely helpful
attitude. What's your reason for it?

22:31.416 --> 22:34.442
l just don't think the system
should have let him go.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.613
Why exactly? The court says he's innocent.

22:37.689 --> 22:42.319
Maybe. But there's another murder
they don't know about.

22:43.995 --> 22:47.328
Bob Fassl's cellmate was
a biker named Spud Jennings.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.061
A real badass, or at least he thought he was.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.500
- Jennings was murdered?
- Oh, yeah.

22:52.571 --> 22:55.597
We found him in a hallway
that Bob Fassl had been mopping.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.507
He was lying ten feet
from Bob Fassl's mop bucket.

22:58.577 --> 23:02.104
- Fassl nowhere to be found.
- Fassl killed him?

23:02.180 --> 23:06.913
The murderer was caught on a security
camera once he turned the corner.

23:06.985 --> 23:12.184
This is a video grab, a pretty clear one.
You can see the blood on his hands.

23:13.525 --> 23:15.993
One problem. This isn't Fassl.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.461
This isn't anybody.

23:18.530 --> 23:23.593
This man doesn't fit the description
of any inmate currently incarcerated here.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.159
We haven't been able to find him since.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.671
Don't ask me to explain it.

23:28.740 --> 23:35.737
We couldn't charge Fassl with it either.
But l know he had something to do with it.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.382
Agent Doggett.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.490
A word, please.

23:53.198 --> 23:56.133
- Don't you have something to tell me?
- What do you mean?

23:56.201 --> 24:00.160
The DNA retests. l understand
you received the results this morning.

24:00.238 --> 24:05.073
- Mr Fassl has been exonerated... again.
- The results aren't that simple.

24:05.143 --> 24:08.909
The DNA is similar to Fassl's to a degree
we haven't made sense of yet.

24:08.980 --> 24:13.280
Look. l just spoke to the DA.
He's authorized a settlement offer

24:13.351 --> 24:18.448
which l intend to deliver
to Mr Fassl's counsel posthaste.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.981
l'll send the bailiffs down
to retrieve the case files.

24:22.060 --> 24:26.656
- Have a nice flight back to DC.
- We need more time to get to the truth.

24:26.932 --> 24:31.926
This isn't about the truth. This is about
getting a conviction, Agent Doggett.

24:32.003 --> 24:37.066
And if we can't get a conviction,
then the truth doesn't matter.

24:39.377 --> 24:43.541
John! l may have a break in this case.

24:43.615 --> 24:48.109
- A suspect.
- A suspect? Not Fassl?

24:48.186 --> 24:50.518
You really need to see this.

24:51.623 --> 24:56.026
- So who is he?
- l'm wondering more ''What is he?''

24:56.094 --> 24:59.689
l ran him through the offender database,
facial recognition.

24:59.764 --> 25:03.495
Came up with nothing.
lt's like he has no identity.

25:03.568 --> 25:08.403
Yet somehow this person materialized
inside a maximum-security prison,

25:08.473 --> 25:12.273
killed an inmate
and then vanished into thin air.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.371
Materialized how?
Like Casper the Friendly Ghost?

25:16.448 --> 25:21.317
When Duke and l entered that house
back in '89, we didn't find ZZ Top here.

25:21.386 --> 25:24.253
We found Bob Fassl, end of story.

25:24.322 --> 25:27.519
Yeah, but what if the two
were somehow connected?

25:27.592 --> 25:31.187
Monica, this is not an X-File.
Don't try to turn it into one.

25:31.296 --> 25:34.925
ln prison, this being, this person,
whatever you wanna call him,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.195
acted as if he were protecting Bob Fassl.

25:37.269 --> 25:40.261
By getting him locked up
in prison in the first place?

25:40.338 --> 25:44.297
So either he's doing Fassl's bidding,
or Fassl's doing his.

25:44.376 --> 25:51.407
l'm thinking this bearded man was the one
who committed the other seven murders.

25:51.483 --> 25:57.752
l think we can prove it. DNA evidence in
the Sing Sing murder was gathered and filed.

25:57.989 --> 26:01.891
All we have to do is compare it
to the DNA from the 1989 murders.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.623
No. Unfortunately that's not gonna work.

26:06.431 --> 26:10.527
- The 1989 evidence has to be thrown out.
- What are you talkin' about?

26:10.602 --> 26:16.006
The hair samples logged
to your crime scene, Agent Doggett,

26:16.074 --> 26:19.373
were not there on the day
the crimes were committed.

26:21.446 --> 26:25.542
Are you accusing me?
Are you accusing me of planting evidence?

26:25.617 --> 26:28.711
l am simply stating the facts. OK?

26:29.721 --> 26:36.024
The DNA evidence that was used
to convict Bob Fassl was planted.

26:46.571 --> 26:49.631
Mr Fassl, l'm Damon Kailer.

26:49.708 --> 26:53.405
l need to speak with your attorney.
ls she here?

26:58.283 --> 27:00.717
You were at my hearing.

27:00.952 --> 27:05.651
l'm the assistant district attorney.
ls Jana home?

27:05.890 --> 27:07.983
She's not here.

27:09.027 --> 27:13.396
Mr Fassl, l came to make
a settlement offer on your case.

27:13.465 --> 27:18.630
There's... There's no reason to be upset.
This is good news for you.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.703
Tell her to call me. We'll work it out.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.410
l wanna go back.

27:31.249 --> 27:34.241
- l'm sorry?
- Please send me back to prison.

27:35.587 --> 27:41.457
Listen, Mr Fassl. l shouldn't be discussing
this with you without your attorney present.

27:41.526 --> 27:45.121
- But it's my fault.
- l can't be hearing this.

27:45.196 --> 27:48.461
- lt's the truth.
- That's not my concern.

28:31.409 --> 28:34.503
- l'm sorry, John.
- You framed Fassl.

28:37.348 --> 28:40.010
You saw how it was going down.

28:40.085 --> 28:45.148
We arrested him at the scene,
but he left no prints, no hair, no fiber.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.657
Nothing to tie him to the murders.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.354
How did you do it?

28:50.428 --> 28:55.331
l took part of a hair sample
that was found at a previous murder,

28:55.433 --> 28:59.096
and put it in with the evidence
from our crime scene.

29:02.674 --> 29:06.974
Johnny, it was the one and only time
l ever did anything like that.

29:07.045 --> 29:11.482
l was scared Fassl would walk,
and l couldn't let that happen.

29:11.549 --> 29:14.882
Not when l knew that... he was guilty.

29:16.321 --> 29:17.686
Oh, God Almighty...

29:17.956 --> 29:20.550
You know this is gonna come out.

29:20.625 --> 29:25.324
No one's gonna hear it from me,
but l can't ask Agent Scully to lie.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.330
l don't want you to.

29:27.398 --> 29:31.027
Duke, you son of a bitch! This is a felony!

29:32.604 --> 29:35.334
l don't know how l can forgive you for this.

29:37.075 --> 29:39.339
You break my heart.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.580
Excuse me. Agent Doggett?

29:48.620 --> 29:51.680
ADA Kailer, l assume you haven't seen him.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.016
No. Why?

29:54.692 --> 29:57.354
Apparently nobody has.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.317
Mr Fassl, when did
you last see Damon Kailer?

30:55.386 --> 31:00.414
Two days ago, at his hearing. My client had
nothing to do with Mr Kailer's disappearance.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.119
- No direct involvement.
- None.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.493
l think we can accept that.

31:07.498 --> 31:10.626
We also accept that Mr Fassl
had no direct involvement

31:10.702 --> 31:13.364
in the seven murders he was convicted of.

31:13.438 --> 31:18.307
How magnanimous of you.
lt's too bad you're 13 years too late.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.435
- ls that it?
- No.

31:21.346 --> 31:25.578
Actually, we believe
this person committed the murders.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.950
What do you think?
Do you recognize this man?

31:33.024 --> 31:35.424
You know, we're here as a courtesy,

31:35.493 --> 31:40.123
which is something the police and
the prosecution never showed Bob once.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.723
Are you a Catholic, Bob?

31:45.536 --> 31:47.299
So am l.

31:49.207 --> 31:54.304
l remember times in my life
when my rosary was a great comfort to me.

31:55.446 --> 31:58.381
Comfort in times of tribulation.

32:00.785 --> 32:04.482
And watching you now, l get the feeling

32:04.555 --> 32:07.547
that this is a tribulation for you.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.928
This man.

32:19.237 --> 32:22.035
ls it that he won't leave you alone, Bob?

32:25.243 --> 32:28.235
ls it that you just want him to go away?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.249
Tell us about him.

32:36.154 --> 32:39.089
Tell us, so we can help make him go away.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.453
No more mind games.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.587
We're done.

33:01.512 --> 33:02.672
What was that?

33:02.914 --> 33:06.111
l don't know about you,
but that was me changing my theory.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.711
- What, no more ghosts?
- Nope.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.479
Just Fassl.

33:12.557 --> 33:18.427
What if a man of profound faith, a devout
Catholic, was incapable of contrition?

33:18.496 --> 33:21.294
As in... he couldn't admit his own sins?

33:21.366 --> 33:25.132
Or even that he had
a sinful side to him, as we all do.

33:25.203 --> 33:30.470
What if he were so frightened by it
that he couldn't even admit it to himself?

33:30.541 --> 33:33.533
Might not that man
manifest a second personality?

33:33.611 --> 33:37.138
But it wouldn't explain the DNA evidence.

33:37.215 --> 33:42.084
lt would if he physically
became that other personality.

33:42.153 --> 33:46.522
So we've moved on from Casper
the Friendly Ghost to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?

33:46.591 --> 33:50.357
There is a precedent
in the Catholic canon itself.

33:50.461 --> 33:53.953
Transubstantiation.
The manipulation of matter and energy.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.363
Water into wine?

33:55.433 --> 33:58.129
Or the communion wafer
into the body of Christ.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.636
Monica, l've slept through Sunday schools,

34:00.705 --> 34:03.970
but l never heard about
the guy becoming another guy.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.272
lt makes sense.

34:06.344 --> 34:10.246
lt explains what happened 13 years ago
and what's happening now.

34:10.313 --> 34:16.719
So what you're saying is, because this man
won't face himself, won't face his own sins,

34:16.954 --> 34:19.717
that he is forced to become someone else.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.117
A killer.

34:24.195 --> 34:30.565
So how does someone go about catching
a killer who hides inside an innocent man?

34:47.018 --> 34:48.485
Do it.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.719
l don't wanna hurt her.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.064
Bob, are you OK?

35:02.366 --> 35:04.061
Kill her.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.698
Oh, my God.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.639
What happened?

35:18.416 --> 35:20.475
l... l fell.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.914
l'll fix you up. You'll be OK.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.670
l'll take the next couple of hours.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.978
You should get some shuteye.

35:57.021 --> 36:00.013
Give yourself a break.
You haven't slept in 48 hours.

36:00.091 --> 36:04.425
l'll sleep once we make sure
this guy Fassl never kills again.

36:04.495 --> 36:07.430
Fassl and his Charlie Manson sidekick.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.262
- They're the same person.
- l don't wanna hear.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.235
l just need to hear
another theory that makes sense.

36:13.304 --> 36:19.004
That theory doesn't make any sense.
How the hell to you does that make sense?

36:25.016 --> 36:28.508
Meat-and-potatoes police work
is what busted this guy 13 years ago.

36:28.619 --> 36:32.214
lt's what's gonna bust him again.
And that's enough.

36:32.290 --> 36:35.123
And the day that's not enough...

36:36.494 --> 36:39.429
then l don't know what to tell you.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.566
Cos l got nothin' else.

36:52.009 --> 36:54.443
Check it out. The front door.

37:05.456 --> 37:07.515
Jana Fain - check on her.

37:08.492 --> 37:11.256
He was here.
He was here, the man in your photo.

37:11.329 --> 37:13.126
The bearded man?

37:13.197 --> 37:16.689
- Where's Bob Fassl?
- He was right there, and then he wasn't.

37:16.934 --> 37:18.196
l don't know where...

37:18.269 --> 37:22.262
- Agent Reyes.
- Call the police.

37:22.373 --> 37:24.432
Agent Reyes.

37:27.511 --> 37:31.538
''Cable access.''
Fassl worked for Triboro Cable.

37:50.468 --> 37:53.596
- The trail ends here.
- Blood.

37:55.973 --> 37:58.168
He could have gone either way.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.101
John.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.044
You OK?

38:10.588 --> 38:12.647
Come on.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.214
l'll take this way.

40:05.703 --> 40:06.897
John!

40:18.582 --> 40:19.981
John!

40:20.050 --> 40:21.574
Monica!

40:36.434 --> 40:41.269
- Let him go. You hear me?
- Don't waste your breath. Shoot the bastard.

40:42.573 --> 40:45.235
Bob Fassl, l'm talking to you.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.671
l know you're in there, Bob.

40:48.746 --> 40:52.307
There's a small part of you in there
that couldn't kill Jana Fain.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.476
l'll kill him.

40:55.386 --> 40:58.685
l believe you, Bob,
because you're a murderer.

40:58.756 --> 41:02.192
Shut up. l'm not him.

41:02.259 --> 41:07.219
- You're notjust a murderer, you're a sinner.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

42:03.654 --> 42:06.953
My housekeeper, Mrs Dowdy, can l see her?

42:08.058 --> 42:11.152
lt's better that you don't.

42:11.228 --> 42:13.560
And the district attorney?

42:15.332 --> 42:18.267
There are a lot of bodies in there.

42:20.271 --> 42:24.264
There are many more victims
than anyone ever knew.

42:30.481 --> 42:35.043
l saw a bearded man. l know what l saw.

42:41.358 --> 42:45.089
Ms Fain, l think we'd better get you home.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.001
John?

43:03.681 --> 43:06.673
l've been 48 hours without sleep.

43:06.917 --> 43:10.546
l found out my ex-partner's a liar, a felon.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.551
Don't ask me to explain how this could be.

43:17.561 --> 43:22.931
So what happened tonight,
all that was just you seeing things?

43:23.968 --> 43:26.027
l can't accept this.

43:26.103 --> 43:30.506
lf you can, God love you,
but it's not the way my mind works.

43:31.342 --> 43:33.606
You closed this case.

43:35.412 --> 43:38.176
This time around that was enough.

43:40.584 --> 43:43.280
What happens next time?

44:07.578 --> 44:10.046
