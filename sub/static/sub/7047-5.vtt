00:01.960 --> 00:03.461
Previously on Justified...

00:03.545 --> 00:06.506
Raylan, your daddy's been arrested.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.509
Is there something else?

00:09.593 --> 00:13.763
Well, they left a number in case you wanted
to get an update on how he's doing.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.766
He's fine. I'm sure he's feeling right at home.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.895
- I swore I'd never come back here.
- I know.

00:20.979 --> 00:25.274
And then, when they sent me here,
I promised myself I'd leave first chance I got.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.568
I know. You told me.

00:27.653 --> 00:33.032
What would happen if I found something
here that made me not want to leave?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.243
That would be a crying shame.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.412
Yeah. See, that's what I thought.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.378
Have you considered the possibility
that he's not in there?

00:45.462 --> 00:46.754
He's in there.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.216
You think he's in there
because you think he wants to see his kids,

00:50.300 --> 00:52.427
but maybe he doesn't give a shit
about his kids.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.554
He's probably not a candidate
for father of the year.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.347
He has shot a cop, among other things.

00:56.432 --> 00:59.600
If he's not here,
then we don't know where he is.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.894
Well, then you're like some drunk
who's looking for his car keys

01:01.979 --> 01:04.230
under a streetlamp
'cause that's where the light is.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.606
One more day.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.902
- Is there not another chair in this hell hole?
- Here, take mine.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.863
You know what? Just sit down.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.199
It's all right. I'm not gonna be here that long.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.287
You've been in here for three days,
and you've got no sign.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.621
Not no sign.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.374
His ex-wife has been packing in a lot of beer.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.877
Well, get a search warrant.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.713
You can't get a warrant
based on beer consumption.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.340
- How do you know?
- We tried.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.677
One more day. One more day.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.430
I thought, after LA,
you two would be sick of each other.

01:37.514 --> 01:41.058
Well, there have been times
I wanted to feed a hose in from the exhaust.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.226
Nice.

01:42.603 --> 01:46.647
All right. One more day, and that's it.

01:46.732 --> 01:51.027
There are fugitives other than
Wilson Toomey that we must pursue.

01:55.491 --> 01:58.409
What are we gonna get with one more day?

02:02.289 --> 02:04.582
I'm gonna get a closer look.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.452
What do you want?

02:42.454 --> 02:45.498
Well, I'm out of work,
you know, due to the economy,

02:45.582 --> 02:49.627
and I was hoping I could do a little work
in your yard for a little food.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.838
- This look like the welfare office to you?
- No, ma'am.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.590
Ain't no handouts here.
I don't need no yard work done.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.970
Well, I'll do it for free. I mean, for free.

02:59.054 --> 03:03.015
And if you like what I do,
then you give me a little food.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.767
And if you don't, I'll be on my way.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.018
You saying my place looks like shit?

03:06.103 --> 03:08.521
No, ma'am, every yard in the world
could use a little work.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.400
I'm telling you, you give me a couple days,
I'll make it look real good.

03:13.110 --> 03:18.781
It's a free country. Do what you want.
But I ain't paying you.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.288
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

03:26.665 --> 03:32.003
- You wrestle a big, bad man today?
- No. I was just gardening.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.546
You were what?

03:33.922 --> 03:39.343
There's this fugitive
we think is holed up at his ex-wife's place.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.971
But we don't have enough
for a search warrant,

03:42.055 --> 03:45.600
so to get a closer look,
I went and knocked on the door

03:45.684 --> 03:49.061
and asked the ex-wife
if I could do some yard work,

03:49.146 --> 03:50.855
she could pay if she wanted to.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.690
Look at you, undercover.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.570
I bet it's the first honest day's work
you've done in a long time.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.739
Why did you think I became a Marshal?

03:59.823 --> 04:04.118
Drive around, drink coffee,
and yell at people.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.122
Your shoulder sore?

04:09.625 --> 04:14.003
Most men would be strapped to a gurney
screaming for morphine, but...

04:15.255 --> 04:16.672
Come here.

04:26.516 --> 04:32.313
- You should look into doing that for a living.
- I bet you expect a happy ending.

04:32.481 --> 04:36.108
- No, I don't.
- It's too bad.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.864
- Ava.
- Ava, what?

04:43.241 --> 04:47.870
"Ava, stop"? Or, "Ava, don't stop"?

04:52.250 --> 04:56.337
- What happened in Harlan...
- Stays in Harlan?

04:59.257 --> 05:04.095
I thought we agreed, given the situation,
that would be a one-time thing.

05:04.554 --> 05:08.349
- Are you serious?
- Well, I'm trying to be.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.651
Yeah, I was driving along Indian Line,

06:00.777 --> 06:05.781
and I think I saw someone
break into the old Grant house.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.802
Come on, Arlo, wake up.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.269
- Hello, Hunter.
- Arlo, what are you doing here?

06:38.440 --> 06:39.899
Where am I?

06:53.288 --> 06:56.582
- Hey, you trash a place pretty good.
- It's my house.

06:56.666 --> 07:01.921
Which you rent to Stan Perkins,
and you broke a lot of his stuff.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.590
He doesn't pay his rent,
which is why I'm here.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.176
I don't like him. You should watch him.

07:07.302 --> 07:12.014
- Well, I'm too busy watching you.
- I haven't done anything in years.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.517
Well, you got that DUI three weeks ago.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.270
That was horseshit, and you know it.
Helen explained that.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.023
Yeah, she was very emphatic.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.819
How long do we wait?

07:24.986 --> 07:29.532
Not too much longer.
Perkins is having supper over at Chickpeas.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.701
They got good pork chops.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.376
You stay put.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.296
Mr. Perkins.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.550
You said there was a break-in.
You didn't tell me about this.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.802
Which is why I asked you
to come home now.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.973
- Well, who did this? Was...
- I did it, you sorry son of a bitch.

07:54.057 --> 07:58.394
- Arlo, I told you to stay put.
- You owe me three months' rent, Perkins.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.856
What? Look, I paid my rent.
I mail my checks on the first.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.191
Do you send it by carrier turtle?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.194
I just wanted to know
if you wanted to press charges.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.406
Well, I don't know. How do I get him to pay
for the stuff he broke?

08:10.866 --> 08:15.411
You ask him. Arlo,
will you pay Mr. Perkins for the damage?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.080
- It's my house.
- Yeah, it's my stuff you broke!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.748
Arlo!

08:21.334 --> 08:22.710
All right.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.381
Yeah, yeah. I'll pay.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.258
Shake.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.104
Give me my goddamn rent.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.191
You know the drill, Arlo.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.756
It's a Harlan number. But I don't recognize it.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.966
Call it.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.808
Hello, I just got a call from this number.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.687
It's for you.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.153
Hello?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.950
I'll be there as soon as I can.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.706
- Who was that?
- Aunt Helen.

10:24.374 --> 10:29.128
- Your step mom?
- I prefer to think of her as Aunt Helen.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.338
Why did she call?

10:33.883 --> 10:37.052
She wants me to go bail my father out of jail.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.682
How long's it been since you've seen Arlo?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.144
Last time I saw him,

10:47.564 --> 10:50.482
he was being carted off to jail.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.610
Why can't you bail him out?

11:34.736 --> 11:37.529
Those are the first words out of your mouth?

11:37.614 --> 11:40.741
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll start again.
I see you're still smoking.

11:40.825 --> 11:45.371
- You still piss in your bed?
- No, you see, I gave up my bad habits.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.124
Not all of them, I hope. How's Ava?

11:50.627 --> 11:53.921
She's... How did you know to call her?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.881
I thought she might know how to reach you,

11:55.965 --> 11:58.801
considering you both shot a Crowder boy
in her dining room.

11:59.803 --> 12:03.514
My original question.
Why can't you bail him out?

12:04.641 --> 12:07.267
Sheriff Hunter and his jackboot thugs

12:07.352 --> 12:10.145
pulled your father over for DUI
a few weeks back,

12:10.271 --> 12:14.817
and I got a little boisterous in his defense,
and they got a restraining order on me.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.360
I can't go in the jail.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.320
Fine. Give me the money. I'll go get him.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.031
- Aren't you even gonna ask what he did?
- Honestly, I don't care.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.452
There's a man, Stan Perkins. I don't like him.
He's renting my old house on Indian Line.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.954
Arlo just went over there
to collect the back rent...

12:27.038 --> 12:28.372
There's always a reason, huh?

12:28.498 --> 12:32.167
Rent's about the only money we got
besides the government check.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.383
You want me to post the bail.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.973
There's got to be 50 people in this town
that could front you that money.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.892
And not one of them is his son.

12:50.019 --> 12:54.022
You came to town.
You didn't so much as call.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.986
It was work.

12:59.487 --> 13:03.490
I got to go get his prescriptions.
You drive him home.

13:03.575 --> 13:07.661
- I'll put him in a taxi.
- You drive your father home.

13:15.170 --> 13:20.174
I say what the bartender told me to say,
that the guy next to me threw up on me

13:20.258 --> 13:24.303
and he felt so bad he gave me $20
to get the jacket clean.

13:24.387 --> 13:30.767
Helen thinks it's bullshit,
but I tell her to put her hand into my pocket.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.728
She does, and she pulls out money.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.105
"But there's two $20's here," she says.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.401
"I know," I said. "He also shit my pants."

13:43.615 --> 13:45.532
I like the hat.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.252
Hell. Stan.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.588
You need an ice bag for your nut sack?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.219
- That's one.
- One what?

14:05.428 --> 14:07.179
Get to three, and you'll find out.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.140
You know what? Arlo took something
of mine, and I want it back.

14:10.266 --> 14:15.521
What? Your dignity?
Being laid out by a man that age.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.357
Hey, you know that space behind the closet?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.526
Arlo told me about it when I moved in.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.820
He said that if I had something valuable,
to put it there.

14:23.947 --> 14:28.075
Well, guess what. I had something valuable,
and I put it there, but it's not there anymore.

14:28.284 --> 14:32.120
So, you're gonna show us where it is.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.457
Or do you want my nephews to find it?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.293
I want you to leave is what I want.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.421
Guys, go.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.923
Don't you touch our stuff!

14:43.007 --> 14:45.801
- Hey!
- Two.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.845
You listen to me. I hate this place.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.641
I hate every last one of you
knuckle-dragging shitheads.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.185
I'm only here 'cause I have to be, okay?

14:55.436 --> 14:57.437
The second I can, I am out of this cesspool,

14:57.522 --> 14:59.481
but I need money.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.818
And to get that money,
I need what your husband took from me,

15:02.944 --> 15:05.988
so either I get it or I kill him.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.949
Threatening my husband makes three.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.952
Should I be scared? Hey, guys, you scared?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.632
What brings you to Kentucky?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.302
I got the feeling
you weren't ever coming back.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.178
I was transferred.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.473
I heard about you shooting Boyd.

15:34.058 --> 15:38.186
All's I need is a bunch of Crowders
wanting revenge on a Givens.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.732
Well, I think I'm higher up on their list.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.073
It's good Bo's still upstate.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.910
Hey, how many men you shot?

15:54.912 --> 15:56.622
Why you want to know that?

15:57.206 --> 16:02.544
All the shit I pulled over the years,
I never shot anyone. Not a one.

16:11.095 --> 16:15.349
- Want to come in?
- Nope. I got to get back to Lexington.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.059
Suit yourself.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.247
Those headstones spooked you as a boy.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.669
Remember how I got them?
In trade for some cows?

16:43.753 --> 16:46.296
Stolen cows, as I recall.

16:46.756 --> 16:51.259
I thought I'd be under mine
long before Frances was under hers.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.429
At least say goodbye to Helen.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.600
What the hell happened to my screen door?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.436
Helen? Helen?

17:02.605 --> 17:06.983
What in the hell happened here? You okay?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.318
Do I look okay?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.531
Was it Perkins?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.825
It wasn't the Easter Bunny.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.285
I almost got that little pecker with a knife.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.624
- What are you looking for?
- My bat.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.335
I'm gonna put that asshole's head in.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.463
- It was his boys who tackled me.
- Then I'll go hurt them.

17:28.673 --> 17:32.801
- Your bat's probably still at Perkins'.
- I'll just use Raylan's bat.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.969
Arlo!

17:34.470 --> 17:37.472
Raylan, tell your father to leave it alone.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.853
No, I think you got it under control. So long.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.856
Hold on a sec.

17:47.150 --> 17:50.235
Why did those guys knock you around?
This all 'cause of rent?

17:50.319 --> 17:54.030
- I told you. We need the money.
- Yeah, no, I can see that.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.366
You don't like it, pick up a paintbrush.
Get to work.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.244
Perkins never sent the rent?

18:00.079 --> 18:03.832
- It's possible he did and we forgot.
- Helen.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.209
- We're old, Raylan. We forget things.
- Jesus.

18:06.502 --> 18:11.047
Arlo is up to something.
What, is he trying to scam this guy, huh?

18:11.174 --> 18:15.010
Get him to pay rent twice?
I should have never come.

18:15.344 --> 18:16.595
Your father had a heart attack.

18:18.681 --> 18:19.681
When?

18:20.183 --> 18:21.683
Two years ago.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.896
He went to the V.A.
On account of his Vietnam service.

18:26.063 --> 18:30.692
While he was there, he snapped,
lost his mind for a few days.

18:30.777 --> 18:35.030
They diagnosed him with
that stress disorder, TP...

18:35.114 --> 18:36.907
Yeah, PTSD.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.992
They also said he's bipolar.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.871
Doctor said that's why one day he'd be like
Santa Claus, tossing out candy,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.707
the next day he'd
bite the head off of anyone who met his eye.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.084
Said that's why he drinks so much.

18:48.211 --> 18:52.881
But he's on medication now.
He's calmer than I ever saw him.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.051
He just busted up a man's house
and squared him in the balls.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.471
- He's still Arlo.
- Yeah.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.808
Thanks for coming down for him.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.562
No, no. I didn't come down for him.
I came down for you.

19:28.251 --> 19:31.628
Deputy, I didn't mean anything.
I would not hurt your mother.

19:31.754 --> 19:32.963
Stepmother.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.424
Yeah, look,
I don't want any trouble with anybody.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.136
To me, everybody's a potential customer,
even Arlo.

19:40.263 --> 19:45.350
I was just trying to get compensated
for the property that your father damaged,

19:45.434 --> 19:47.602
and then she pulls a knife.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.312
What line of work you in?

19:49.438 --> 19:51.857
I have a bath and kitchen furnishing
business.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.525
And the men with you?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.360
Those guys do the shipping
and receiving for me.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.695
They're my...

19:56.779 --> 19:59.948
Look, I know they're not
the sharpest candles. They're my nephews.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.535
Why bring them with you
to talk to an old man and a woman?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.955
'Cause the last time I talked to your father,
he kicked me in the nuts.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.792
Okay, Mr. Perkins.
Here's what we're gonna do.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.129
If Arlo comes by,
and if he asks about the rent again,

20:14.297 --> 20:15.630
you're gonna call me.

20:17.008 --> 20:21.469
You paid your rent. He just forgot.

20:26.017 --> 20:30.312
- Want some water?
- No. The hose is fine.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.149
But I never say no to a glass.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.069
Thank you.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.991
Didn't see you this morning.
Didn't think you were coming back.

20:44.410 --> 20:49.080
Yeah. I had some work at another house.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.416
Still ain't paying you, you know.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.502
That's all right.
At least it gives me something to do.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.839
If you're still here at suppertime,
I'll get you a hamburger.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.388
Miss Crowder, Mr. Vincent.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.934
I'm Assistant United States Attorney,
David Vasquez.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.060
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.437
Miss Crowder, I want to thank you
for coming all this way to talk to me.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
Like I said on the phone,
I just have a few questions

21:14.106 --> 21:16.399
about the night Boyd Crowder was shot.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.861
Normally, my assistant would take notes,
but she's out sick today.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.280
Got someone to cover for her.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.866
Miss Hawkins, hope I didn't rush your lunch.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.201
- Not to worry.
- All right.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.080
Well, you'll let me know when you're ready,
and we'll get started.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.456
I'm ready.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.916
Miss Crowder,
I just want to ask you a few questions

21:33.042 --> 21:34.918
about the night Boyd Crowder
was shot in your home

21:35.044 --> 21:36.628
by deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.047
Okay?

21:39.256 --> 21:41.508
- What is it?
- I need to be excused.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.717
Why?

21:42.802 --> 21:46.221
Well, before I was Winona Hawkins,
I was Winona Givens.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.808
- No shit.
- Yeah, no shit, indeed.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.602
- Well, then, I'll have to excuse you.
- All right.

21:54.605 --> 21:59.985
I would prefer if you just said I had some
court work to take care of that I remembered

22:00.069 --> 22:02.654
- and not mention the conflict.
- Why?

22:03.489 --> 22:06.741
That's just the way I'd prefer to handle it.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.743
- Okay.
- All right.

22:17.044 --> 22:21.923
Hello, boys. I got what you
and Stan are looking for right here.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.801
We'll go around back
and continue this in private,

22:24.885 --> 22:27.887
but I thought you might want to take a peek.

22:28.180 --> 22:32.267
You fellas old enough to remember
the great Henry Aaron?

22:35.146 --> 22:38.523
- Don't you ever touch my wife again!
- No!

22:39.608 --> 22:42.736
Back off, boy.
This got nothing to do with you.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.947
Where you going,
you little frigging cockroach?

22:46.907 --> 22:48.199
Arlo! Stop!

23:11.223 --> 23:12.348
I think I just saw him.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.851
- You sure?
- I'm gonna go check it out.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.776
- What now?
- Sorry to bother you.

23:22.943 --> 23:28.656
I just been drinking out of that hose all day,
and could I use your bathroom?

23:30.284 --> 23:33.453
Well, I'd tell you to piss outside,
but that flower bed looks pretty good.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.579
Come on.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.089
I know what you're doing.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.553
I'm sorry?

23:50.638 --> 23:53.223
Getting people hooked on gardening.
First one's free.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.058
Then you get them
jonesing for more weeding.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.268
Jack up the price. Am I right?

24:00.481 --> 24:03.942
I'm just joking.
Talking about gardening like it's dope.

24:04.026 --> 24:06.653
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- What's up?

24:06.737 --> 24:09.864
It's a private thing. It's a guy thing.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.867
- What is it?
- All right.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.498
What is it?

24:20.042 --> 24:23.461
I don't want to make a scene
in front of your kids.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.339
I'm a Deputy US Marshal.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.842
I'm here to arrest you
on an outstanding federal warrant.

24:31.011 --> 24:37.058
And I'm wearing work boots that aren't mine,
so don't you even think about running.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.161
Let him go!

24:59.665 --> 25:04.752
Mrs. Toomey, let's wait one second,
consider the situation, shall we?

25:05.462 --> 25:09.382
I am a Deputy United States Marshal.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.593
We don't do these things alone, either.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.472
So you know I got backup
listening to everything right now

25:16.557 --> 25:20.310
on a little microphone
here in my shirt collar.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.896
They're gonna hear you die
unless you let me go.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.107
They won't be the only ones.

25:32.406 --> 25:36.201
Go to your bedroom! Go on, now!

25:36.577 --> 25:38.036
Now, let him go.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.872
You don't put that weapon down,
shots will be fired,

25:40.956 --> 25:43.166
and I cannot predict the outcome.

25:43.375 --> 25:48.421
But you put it down, I'll see to it
that no charges are filed against you.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.550
At least them kids can grow up
with their mother.

25:54.845 --> 25:57.639
Any other end to this is sad or tragic.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.115
I knew I shouldn't trust you.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.035
Backyard looks good, though, don't it?

26:23.332 --> 26:24.582
Givens.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.962
Helen, what is it?

26:32.967 --> 26:37.136
- You been to see your father yet?
- No, I wanted to see you first.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.596
You gonna prosecute?

26:39.348 --> 26:42.850
That's up to the DA,
but he really tuned them up, Raylan.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.019
Didn't think he had it in him.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.273
If he hadn't dropped from the heart attack,
he might could have killed one of them.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.608
Yeah, they roughed up Helen.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.528
- You defending Arlo?
- No.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.282
Anything I should know about Perkins?

26:57.366 --> 27:00.285
Why? You want to do my job for me,
Mr. Big Federal Marshal Man?

27:00.369 --> 27:02.161
I just want to go back to Lexington.

27:02.246 --> 27:05.331
- Hell, I'd like to go back to Miami.
- Oh, yeah?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.583
Well, Perkins just got his release

27:07.668 --> 27:11.462
after a six-year stretch
trafficking in stolen pharmaceuticals.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.506
- When did you find that out?
- This morning.

27:13.590 --> 27:16.926
Hey, after all of this,
I thought I should look into it.

27:17.011 --> 27:21.222
Made some calls, and so far
his kitchen-and-toilet business checks out.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.016
- And the nephews?
- Oh, they got records,

27:23.100 --> 27:26.019
but it's mostly petty shit. No real time.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.022
What the hell they doing in Harlan?

27:29.106 --> 27:32.608
Well, some folks actually like it here, Raylan.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.536
- How is he?
- Asleep.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.248
Doctor says he's a lucky man.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.835
We both know that's a lie.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.923
How have you put up with him
all these years?

27:57.468 --> 27:59.510
We suffer well together.

28:00.054 --> 28:03.556
Then why are you out here
and not in there with him?

28:05.184 --> 28:08.936
Has nothing to do
with the shotgun in your backseat?

28:09.063 --> 28:12.023
Perkins may be coming to finish off Arlo.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.443
I want to be here to greet him
when he gets here.

28:15.652 --> 28:20.281
Yeah, well, be careful.
12-gauge has a hell of a kick.

28:23.327 --> 28:26.245
And we looked out of our tent,
and there was a bear.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.998
A big goddamn grizzly bear.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.209
I look at Jimbo,
and he's putting on his sneakers,

28:31.293 --> 28:33.294
and I say,
"What are you putting on your sneakers for?

28:33.379 --> 28:38.633
"A grizzly bear can run 30 miles an hour.
You can't run faster than a grizzly bear."

28:38.926 --> 28:41.469
And Jimbo looks at me and says,

28:41.553 --> 28:43.805
"I don't have to run faster
than a grizzly bear,

28:43.889 --> 28:46.641
"I just have to run faster than you."

28:47.684 --> 28:49.435
That's an old joke, Mr. Givens.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.314
And I'm an old man.
All's I know are old jokes.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.402
Hey, doc.

28:58.695 --> 29:03.866
This is my son, Raylan.
He's a United States Marshal.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.827
Nice to meet you. You must be very proud.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.578
You have no idea.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.080
It's time for you to go back
to your bed, Mr. Givens.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.415
I'd like you lying down.

29:15.212 --> 29:20.258
Don't just yank them out,
thinking that'll solve all your problems.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.680
It's good to see you.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.520
That's it?

29:34.273 --> 29:38.484
You're not even gonna lie
and say it's good to see me?

29:41.238 --> 29:43.281
It's good to see you.

29:46.326 --> 29:51.205
You know, what you do, your line of work...

29:52.124 --> 29:58.379
I think you've seen things that put to shame
what you see as your hard life.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.257
That's true.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.594
But our stories are our own, huh?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.181
We've all got our cross to bear.

30:08.515 --> 30:12.477
- Remember your grandfather, my pop?
- Not well.

30:12.603 --> 30:17.190
He was no picnic.
Was a preacher when I was a boy.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.026
A real old-time religion man.

30:20.569 --> 30:24.447
His God was the Lord of war and thunder.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.575
That house was nothing but fear.

30:27.659 --> 30:33.831
And I rebelled, as boys do,
chose a path I knew would aggravate,

30:33.916 --> 30:37.001
and it did, which is why you barely saw him.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.128
He didn't much approve.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.886
Helen told me you had a heart attack
two years ago.

30:47.221 --> 30:48.971
Went to the VA.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.723
She told you that?

30:51.558 --> 30:55.394
She tell you about the stress disorder,
the bipolar?

30:55.479 --> 30:57.188
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.525
What do you think about all that?

31:02.402 --> 31:05.238
I think it's bullshit, myself.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.616
I think you need to be careful about Perkins.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.537
Where were you, woman?

31:12.621 --> 31:15.915
Down in the parking lot,
giving blowjobs for cash.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.917
Were you paying or were they?

31:18.877 --> 31:22.922
Why did you wake him?
Could have had a peaceful night.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.132
What were you saying about Perkins?

31:26.969 --> 31:28.427
I was saying

31:28.512 --> 31:33.099
I think you picked the wrong man
to pull your little rent scam on.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.934
Rent scam?
What the hell are you talking about?

31:35.018 --> 31:36.602
- I didn't pull any rent...
- Arlo.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.397
Stan Perkins may look like a pushover.

31:39.481 --> 31:43.234
And maybe that's why you thought
you could put one over on him.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.735
But he is not.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.406
You understand me?
You best leave him alone.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.994
- Long as he leaves us alone.
- He comes by, you call Sheriff Hunter.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.705
- I can handle him.
- No, you can't.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.852
- Johnny Crowder.
- In the parking lot.

32:22.024 --> 32:26.694
Well, Raylan Givens. If it isn't old 25.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.237
Johnny.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.198
I'm sorry. I forgot your number.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.535
Jesus, Raylan. All the times I struck you out,
you think you'd remember.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.040
What are you doing here?
You come for a beer?

32:39.291 --> 32:41.208
No, I'm coming to see you, actually.

32:41.418 --> 32:44.253
Oh, well. I am honored and humbled.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.715
- And a little more than surprised.
- I need a favor, Johnny.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.551
Why don't you girls go inside,
get yourself a drink?

32:56.391 --> 32:57.725
You shot my cousin.

32:58.101 --> 33:03.105
No, no. God shot Boyd. Ask him.
He'll tell you I saved his soul.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.567
Okay, what's the favor?

33:06.985 --> 33:10.488
You know Stan Perkins?
Renting my aunt's old place?

33:11.073 --> 33:13.157
- I do.
- He up to something?

33:13.492 --> 33:14.909
How would I know that?

33:15.077 --> 33:18.663
You serve hard alcohol.
People talk too much as it is.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.627
You still play ball?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.338
Oh, I'm a solid.200 hitter.

33:28.465 --> 33:31.342
I'll tell you what.
How about I give you three good pitches?

33:31.426 --> 33:34.345
If you get one, I'll answer your question.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.931
- Where?
- Right there is good.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.349
You got a bat?

33:38.433 --> 33:41.602
Of course I got a bat.
What do you think, I'm a fag?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.192
Strike one.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.552
Foul ball. Strike two.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.141
Shit.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.235
It was a good pitch.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.572
Yeah, well, it was a better swing.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.411
Perkins? He into something?

34:42.164 --> 34:44.373
Yeah. He's moving hillbilly heroin.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.083
You know what that is
or you been gone too long?

34:47.168 --> 34:51.422
OxyContin.
Is he keeping it in my aunt's old place?

34:51.590 --> 34:54.341
Well, I don't know where he keeps it.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.433
It's good to see you, Johnny.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.851
Hey, Raylan.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.772
This is just a friendly heads up, now.

35:08.190 --> 35:12.735
Bo Crowder's getting out of prison soon.
And Ava killed his son.

35:13.695 --> 35:16.405
Now, a lot of folks around here might think
Bowman deserved it,

35:16.531 --> 35:21.035
but Bo will not be one of those people.

35:22.204 --> 35:25.039
Ava might want to get herself
out of Kentucky as soon as she can.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.059
- Mr. Perkins.
- Deputy Givens.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.604
- I'd like to have a word. May I come in?
- All right.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.484
- Did you see what he did?
- That's why I'm here.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.028
I just want to stop this thing
before it gets any worse.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.863
- He could have killed them.
- I know.

35:57.948 --> 36:02.451
Arlo's an angry man when he's pushed at all.
You messed with his wife.

36:02.577 --> 36:06.247
I know she pulled the knife. I'm just saying.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.168
Sometimes with Arlo,
you don't have to push at all.

36:11.253 --> 36:14.630
You're not from around here.
You know tornado weather?

36:14.756 --> 36:18.926
Sky turns green,
and you know something's coming.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.804
Some days,
that's the way it was in the house.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.180
Arlo would ask a question,

36:23.265 --> 36:25.641
you'd try desperately
to come up with the right answer,

36:25.767 --> 36:29.103
what he wanted to hear,
except there wasn't any right answer at all.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.606
It was going south
no matter what you said or did.

36:33.942 --> 36:39.780
Folks knew what was going on,
but Arlo was a powerful man back then.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.825
Nobody did anything.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.245
Except for my Aunt Helen.
She wouldn't intervene.

36:46.329 --> 36:50.708
She's just park her Ford Fairlane outside,
and I'd come running out.

36:51.126 --> 36:54.169
She'd bring me here.
This was her house then.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.672
I loved it here.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.467
She always kept ice-cold Cokes in the fridge.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.386
She was the first person I knew
had cable TV.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.555
I'd sit right over there,

37:04.639 --> 37:08.392
and I'd watch episodes of Rawhide
and Have Gun - Will Travel.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.935
- You know those shows?
- No.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.147
They're pretty good. Is that my father's bat?

37:13.565 --> 37:14.815
Yeah.

37:18.653 --> 37:23.365
We played games, board games,
you know, Monopoly.

37:24.367 --> 37:28.412
What's that one
where you're the jewel thief?

37:28.496 --> 37:30.581
Can't remember what it's called.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.708
We'd play hide-and-seek.

37:32.834 --> 37:35.794
You want to know my favorite hiding spot?

37:35.879 --> 37:38.255
Yeah, come here. I'll show you.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.263
It was that closet, right there.

37:52.354 --> 37:57.524
I knew every inch of this space.
I remember that carpet and this paneling.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.068
The secret compartment.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.195
- You guys know about that?
- No.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.614
Oh, I'm sure it's still there.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.033
Oh, yes.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.751
Well, what the hell is this?

38:17.545 --> 38:19.880
I don't know. No.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.553
You take another step,
I'll shoot you where you stand.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.847
Now, you and your brother,
lay down on your tummies.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.599
You put your hand behind your head.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.059
Go on.

38:32.394 --> 38:35.187
- You working with him now? Is that it?
- Working with who?

38:35.271 --> 38:37.564
You expect me to believe
you didn't plant that OxyContin?

38:37.899 --> 38:39.358
I didn't plant anything.

38:39.442 --> 38:43.570
You think I'd let you look in that closet
if I thought there were any drugs in there?

38:43.655 --> 38:45.698
Last time I looked, it was empty.

38:45.782 --> 38:49.743
- What was in there before that?
- If I tell you, what do you give me?

38:50.078 --> 38:53.288
How about the beating you won't get
for messing with my Aunt Helen.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.084
When I came back on Tuesday night,
after dinner,

38:57.460 --> 39:00.087
I had left $75,000 worth in there.

39:00.171 --> 39:05.050
When I got home,
Arlo had trashed the place,

39:05.135 --> 39:07.177
and the drugs were gone.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.722
Where did you go?

39:09.806 --> 39:12.307
I went by your old place.
Isn't that where you wanted me to go?

39:12.434 --> 39:13.642
What do you mean?

39:13.768 --> 39:17.688
Perkins let me right in
like he didn't have a care in the world.

39:17.772 --> 39:21.650
And I found the bag of OxyContin
in the compartment behind the closet.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.279
- OxyContin. What?
- It still didn't occur to me.

39:25.530 --> 39:29.116
- What didn't?
- Can I ask you a question?

39:29.284 --> 39:33.203
Is there a part of you
that's just disappointed?

39:34.122 --> 39:35.622
Disappointed?

39:35.832 --> 39:39.293
- In that you raised such an idiot?
- What are you talking about?

39:39.377 --> 39:40.836
He had a heart attack today.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.882
Oh, my God. Is that true? Arlo, I am so sorry.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.633
- Raylan.
- Helen.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.636
Go outside and have a menthol.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.473
Go.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.900
So, you stole the drugs, huh?

40:03.318 --> 40:06.361
Sheriff Hunter found me passed out
in the goddamn chair.

40:06.488 --> 40:07.905
Weren't no drugs on me.

40:07.989 --> 40:11.033
No, no.
Because you took them and stashed them

40:11.159 --> 40:13.827
and then you went back
and waited for the sheriff.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.789
Hell, I bet you even called in the burglary.

40:16.873 --> 40:22.002
Seems you didn't pay
close enough attention growing up.

40:22.837 --> 40:26.590
You don't steal something
and then go back and call the police.

40:26.883 --> 40:30.344
Well, you do when it's something
that can't be reported stolen.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.513
And you want to end up in jail,

40:32.597 --> 40:35.182
so your son, the Deputy Marshal,
can bail you out,

40:35.892 --> 40:38.102
and you know
when he tumbles onto Perkins,

40:38.186 --> 40:40.687
he's gonna help you put him away.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.775
You think I got stolen drugs?

40:44.901 --> 40:47.653
Get a warrant and search the house.

40:47.737 --> 40:51.198
And he continues to treat me like an idiot.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.787
I'll tell you what.
I know the OxyContin's gone.

40:56.871 --> 41:00.332
I know the money you got from it is probably
buried under the ground someplace

41:00.416 --> 41:03.752
- just like you used to do when I was a kid.
- Prove it. Any of it.

41:03.878 --> 41:06.380
But what you didn't think about...

41:07.048 --> 41:09.383
What I'd do when I found out about you.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.636
Whine?

41:16.766 --> 41:21.812
I got you out of jail.
At the very least, I'll get you back in.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.404
It's not what it looks like, Raylan.

41:30.488 --> 41:33.115
Oh, I think it's exactly what it looks like.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.783
And that bail I posted,

41:34.909 --> 41:38.078
please consider that
a belated wedding present.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.665
You know what really pisses me off?
That you were in on it.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.333
Now you're just talking out of your ass.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.627
Arlo could have done most of it by himself,

41:45.753 --> 41:48.755
but that bag of OxyContin
that was planted there for me to find,

41:48.840 --> 41:50.716
Arlo was here when that happened.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.969
Raylan, honey.
I swear, I had nothing to do with it.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.889
No. One of the things
my Aunt Helen taught me,

41:56.973 --> 42:00.142
along with how to talk to a girl
and order food at a nice restaurant,

42:00.268 --> 42:02.144
was how to spot a lie.

42:02.979 --> 42:05.480
You think what you want. But consider this,

42:05.607 --> 42:07.900
maybe whatever you think happened
wouldn't have happened

42:07.984 --> 42:11.778
if you'd just bothered to come
see your father when you came to town.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.865
He did all this because he was angry at me.

42:15.283 --> 42:16.617
Oh, okay.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.829
Your father didn't fake a heart attack.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.999
The heart attack was real!

42:24.626 --> 42:27.002
Him wanting to see you was real, too!

42:27.128 --> 42:29.213
Well, he saw me.
