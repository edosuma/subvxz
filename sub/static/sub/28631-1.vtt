(typewriter keys clacking)

01:05.750 --> 01:10.750
(beeping)
(upbeat news music)

01:14.950 --> 01:16.570
- You just heard that presentation

01:16.570 --> 01:18.650
from Fathers Against Pornography,

01:18.650 --> 01:20.870
who are helping to combat
the terrible addictions

01:20.870 --> 01:22.090
sweeping this land.

01:22.090 --> 01:25.003
And you can help them fight
this terrible addiction.

01:25.940 --> 01:28.823
Go online and download their hints.

01:30.130 --> 01:31.890
Since we're talkin' about addiction,

01:31.890 --> 01:33.750
we should talk about the scourge

01:33.750 --> 01:36.300
that is sweeping America right now.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.890
We've brought this up on the show before,

01:37.890 --> 01:40.120
and the government
denies that it's a thing.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.550
But we have here

01:42.800 --> 01:45.200
this mountain of evidence.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.430
Now I told Rufus, he's
our head of research,

01:48.430 --> 01:51.610
I told Rufus, get all of
our documents together,

01:51.610 --> 01:56.070
hours and hours of footage,
it's time to put it on the air.

01:56.070 --> 01:57.436
It is time.

01:57.436 --> 01:59.960
(dramatic music)

01:59.960 --> 02:02.210
There's a drug on the
street, and it is killing us,

02:02.210 --> 02:04.410
and we cannot let this continue.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.010
Now they can call it what they like,

02:06.010 --> 02:07.540
but we know what is.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.523
Spunk.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.080
In the 80s, they denied it.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.860
They said it was just an urban legend.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.270
That there's no such thing as Spunk.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.160
That there isn't a drop of truth in Spunk.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.870
I'm gonna fill you with
so much Spunk truth,

02:21.870 --> 02:23.100
that you're gonna have it coming out of

02:23.100 --> 02:24.573
every hole of your body.

02:25.470 --> 02:27.980
One day, you're going to look at America

02:27.980 --> 02:29.940
and you're not going to recognize it.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.493
You're gonna see a Spunk covered nation of

02:32.493 --> 02:34.528
Spunked up people.

02:34.528 --> 02:37.278
(dramatic music)

02:40.821 --> 02:45.821
(upbeat, quirky music)
(children playing)

02:56.004 --> 02:57.170
(audience laughter)

02:57.170 --> 02:58.003
- Hello Heather.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.861
It's so good to see you
on such short notice.

03:00.861 --> 03:01.895
Shh.
(audience laughter)

03:01.895 --> 03:03.600
The baby's sleeping.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.433
Come on in.

03:07.722 --> 03:08.889
- Hi, Heather.

03:10.180 --> 03:11.580
- [Woman] So how's school?

03:11.580 --> 03:12.520
- [Heather] Um, money's a little tight,

03:12.520 --> 03:13.353
but it's good.

03:13.353 --> 03:15.880
- Well I suppose it's
like anything difficult.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.593
I'm sure you'll come out even
stronger on the other end.

03:19.470 --> 03:20.303
Alright.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.170
Oh, um, I've got some
numbers for you here,

03:25.170 --> 03:27.200
in case of an emergency.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.960
There's food in the fridge.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.110
Help yourself to anything.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.830
Are you 21?

03:32.830 --> 03:33.950
Well there's beers in the fridge.

03:33.950 --> 03:34.898
Go ahead and help yourself.

03:34.898 --> 03:36.253
I won't tell.
(audience laughter)

03:36.253 --> 03:38.820
Stewart is a very, very light sleeper,

03:38.820 --> 03:40.320
so please keep it down.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.760
If he wakes, he'll be really cranky.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.593
I think that's everything.

03:43.593 --> 03:45.370
You've got our number.

03:45.370 --> 03:46.440
- Where are you guys headed?

03:46.440 --> 03:48.067
- Oh, we're going to an orgy.

03:48.067 --> 03:50.280
Oh, I'm so excited.
(audience laughter)

03:50.280 --> 03:51.930
Last time we got Stewart.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.763
This time?

03:52.763 --> 03:54.710
Maybe I'll get his sister.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.864
- Come on honey, or we're gonna
be late for the disrobing.

03:56.864 --> 04:01.864
(audience laughter)
(audience clapping)

04:06.681 --> 04:09.328
(slow, dramatic music)

04:09.328 --> 04:14.328

(dramatic music)

04:19.435 --> 04:22.930
(woman screaming)

04:22.930 --> 04:26.303
- I will wash my hands in his blood.

04:35.332 --> 04:38.583
(phone ringing)

04:38.583 --> 04:39.580
- Susie?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.413
Hey girl.

04:40.413 --> 04:41.750
- [Susie] What's up, Heather?

04:41.750 --> 04:42.680
- Oh nothing.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.350
I'm babysitting, and it is so boring here.

04:45.350 --> 04:46.550
- [Susie] They got Netflix?

04:46.550 --> 04:47.383
- No.

04:47.383 --> 04:49.570
And I forgot my laptop.

04:49.570 --> 04:50.403
- [Susie] That sucks.

04:50.403 --> 04:52.040
They got any booze in the house?

04:52.040 --> 04:52.873
- Just beer.

04:52.873 --> 04:53.880
You know I don't like beer.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.400
It tastes like old man ball sweat.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.280
- [Susie] Speaking from experience?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.113
- Ha ha.

04:59.113 --> 05:00.440
You know what I mean.

05:00.440 --> 05:01.440
- [Susie] Oh hey, I gotta go.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.640
Steve's calling.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.230
He's gonna come over and ruin me.

05:04.230 --> 05:06.480
- Oh, alright, um, have fun.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.940
Don't get pregnant.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.750
- [Susie] Can you get
pregnant from your mouth?

05:09.750 --> 05:10.583
- Ugh.

05:10.583 --> 05:15.583
Gross.
(audience laughter)

05:17.148 --> 05:20.398
(upbeat, quirky music)

05:44.209 --> 05:45.042
(groaning)

05:45.042 --> 05:46.427
(spitting)
(audience laughter)

05:46.427 --> 05:47.835
Oh, that's disgusting.

05:47.835 --> 05:50.835
(audience laughter)

05:53.740 --> 05:56.073
(scrubbing)

05:59.421 --> 06:00.504
What is that?

06:01.708 --> 06:04.958
(upbeat, quirky music)

06:11.612 --> 06:15.433
It smells like pineapple.
(audience laughter)

06:16.317 --> 06:18.395
The Cleevers are Spunkers.

06:18.395 --> 06:20.206
(audience laughter)

06:20.206 --> 06:22.717
Well that explains a lot.

06:22.717 --> 06:25.967
(upbeat, quirky music)

06:29.800 --> 06:33.860
Geelee, what's a safe
amount of Spunk to take?

06:33.860 --> 06:36.733
- [Geelee] A tablespoon full
of Spunk is the typical amount.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.780
- Geelee, what's a safe
way to ingest Spunk?

06:42.780 --> 06:43.980
- [Geelee] Many people take Spunk rectally

06:43.980 --> 06:46.040
and women prefer to take Spunk vaginally,

06:46.040 --> 06:48.333
but the safest method is orally.

06:50.004 --> 06:53.110
(upbeat, quirky music)

06:53.110 --> 06:55.300
- Oh, this is stupid, Heather.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.210
That stuff is dangerous.

06:56.210 --> 06:58.563
Just order pizza, read a book, anything.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.210
(upbeat, quirky music)

07:05.220 --> 07:06.290
What the heck.

07:06.290 --> 07:07.590
You only live once, right?

07:12.324 --> 07:17.324

11:05.439 --> 11:06.508
- [Man] 911 emergency.

11:06.508 --> 11:07.779
- The crow man ate the baby.

11:07.779 --> 11:09.039
- [Man] Excuse me?

11:09.039 --> 11:09.872
Ma'am?

11:09.872 --> 11:11.740
- The crow man ate the baby.

11:11.740 --> 11:12.573
- [Man] Ma'am.

11:12.573 --> 11:13.406
- He's gonna eat me next.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.287
- [Man] I need you to slow
down and give me your location.

11:15.287 --> 11:17.460
- No, I'm in the house.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.513
The crow man's here.

11:19.789 --> 11:20.956
Send the pigs.

11:22.399 --> 11:23.232
Okay.

11:25.537 --> 11:27.966
I just have to go up
there and get him out.

11:27.966 --> 11:28.799
Yeah.

11:28.799 --> 11:30.651
I just have to cut him out.

11:30.651 --> 11:32.171
I can do that.

11:32.171 --> 11:33.338
I can do that.

11:35.516 --> 11:38.707

11:38.707 --> 11:40.124
Don't fear, baby.

You give me back the baby!

12:15.521 --> 12:16.354

12:16.354 --> 12:18.048
- Fuck off, I'm busy.

We don't want any.

(upbeat, quirky music)

13:19.325 --> 13:20.242
I'm hungry.

13:39.310 --> 13:40.480
- Woo.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.940
I am sore and sticky.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.250
- You're sore?

13:44.250 --> 13:46.874
I feel like I've been
sitting on a fire hydrant.

13:46.874 --> 13:49.196

13:49.196 --> 13:50.029

13:50.029 --> 13:50.862
- Oh my god.

13:53.455 --> 13:54.650
- Oh hey guys.

13:55.487 --> 13:59.227
Sorry, but I ate up all your chicken.

13:59.227 --> 14:00.741
(screaming)

14:00.741 --> 14:02.991
(laughing)

14:04.342 --> 14:08.342
(soft, upbeat orchestral music)

14:10.641 --> 14:15.641
(beeping)
(upbeat news music)

14:15.887 --> 14:18.190
(sighing)

14:18.190 --> 14:20.510
- If this is a delivery
device from someone's

14:20.510 --> 14:23.230
hideous agenda, it's
certainly one that makes

14:23.230 --> 14:25.650
me need to change my pants.

14:25.650 --> 14:28.050
Now, uh, we've got a
friend on the line from

14:28.050 --> 14:28.973
Flickhead Video.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.180
Travis, go ahead.

14:32.180 --> 14:33.770
You're on the air.

14:33.770 --> 14:34.603
- [Travis] Hiya John.

14:34.603 --> 14:35.436
Thanks.

14:35.436 --> 14:37.550
- I have the video that
you sent in Travis.

14:37.550 --> 14:39.930
Now, it took a while to
get onto the computer,

14:39.930 --> 14:40.763
but we,

14:42.460 --> 14:44.710
for our younger viewers out there,

14:44.710 --> 14:48.010
this is what we used to watch before DVD.

14:48.010 --> 14:50.033
VHS cassettes.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.490
Travis, why did you send over this tape?

14:53.490 --> 14:55.870
- [Travis] Well, here at
Flickhead, we take trade ins.

14:55.870 --> 14:57.930
DVD, VHS, Hi8, whatever.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.950
Two weeks back some
vaping millennial fucktard

15:00.950 --> 15:05.180
snowflake came in with
his lumbersexual beard

15:05.180 --> 15:08.090
and he had this great big box, right?

15:08.090 --> 15:09.550
Inside, I fond this tape.

15:09.550 --> 15:11.500
When I saw the title, it hit me, Johnny.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.180
It was your show.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.013
Okay?

15:14.013 --> 15:15.010
Now I watched it all the time.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.640
That Spunk was bad shit.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.520
And I remember it.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.170
And I know, well nobody
fuckin' talks about it anymore,

15:20.170 --> 15:21.800
and I don't know if
it's some Mandela Effect

15:21.800 --> 15:23.420
or somethin', but, but I tell ya,

15:23.420 --> 15:24.703
I had to send it into ya.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.140
- You're absolutely right Travis.

15:27.140 --> 15:28.360
It is something bigger.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.100
Is is the truth.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.123
Actual, factual truth.

15:33.185 --> 15:34.760
Now you stay tuned, Travis.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.510
We've got something more coming up.

15:38.796 --> 15:40.879
(static)

15:44.830 --> 15:48.030
(slow, dramatic music)

15:48.030 --> 15:50.410
- In today's modern world,
there are so many threats

15:50.410 --> 15:54.190
facing our children, it's hard
to keep track of them all.

15:54.190 --> 15:56.610
Heavy metal, video games,

15:56.610 --> 15:58.373
live action role play.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.590
But there's an epidemic
sweeping across this nation,

16:02.590 --> 16:05.070
and it threatens the very lives and souls

16:05.070 --> 16:06.563
of each and every child.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.800
It's in our homes.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.190
It's in our schools,
and it's on our streets.

16:13.190 --> 16:17.403
Parents have been powerless
to stop its insidious spread.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.908
Until now.

16:20.908 --> 16:24.158
(dramatic synth music)

16:26.830 --> 16:29.200
It's a war zone out there.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.530
And parents, consider
this video cassette your

16:31.530 --> 16:33.200
first line of defense.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.033
Learn from us.

16:34.033 --> 16:35.900
We're the experts.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.890
Let us help you keep your
kids from ever tasting

16:39.747 --> 16:41.969
the Devil's Spunk.

16:41.969 --> 16:44.469
(synth music)

17:00.777 --> 17:03.027
(laughing)

17:07.740 --> 17:11.599
The Devil's Spunk is
transported in prophylactics.

17:11.599 --> 17:15.060
These latex abominations that sinners use

17:15.060 --> 17:17.223
to divert God's master plan.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.550
In the average junior high school,

17:21.550 --> 17:24.200
it's said that 93% of students have tried

17:24.200 --> 17:26.829
the Devil's Spunk at least once.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.757
Reports quote them as saying that it's a

17:28.757 --> 17:30.420
"Totally rad drug"

17:30.420 --> 17:34.080
and "It didn't taste as bad
as Felicia said it would."

17:34.080 --> 17:36.220
But the most important
statistic that parents

17:36.220 --> 17:38.180
need to know is this:

17:38.180 --> 17:41.100
100% of students who've
tried the Devil's Spunk

17:41.100 --> 17:43.783
have just ruined their lives.

17:45.350 --> 17:46.878
Forever.

17:46.878 --> 17:49.034
(synth music)

17:49.034 --> 17:49.867
Hm.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.233
Let me tell you a story
about a boy named Billy.

17:55.970 --> 17:57.790
He was an all star athlete,

17:57.790 --> 18:00.480
starting pitcher for the varsity team.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.500
He got good grades.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.480
Dated a beautiful girl.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.723
Worshiped an even more beautiful God.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.730
That is, until the day
his soft, virgin lips

18:10.730 --> 18:13.230
came into contact with

18:13.230 --> 18:14.513
the Devil's Spunk.

18:17.010 --> 18:18.460
(spitting)

18:18.460 --> 18:21.178
- Give me the heat,
Billy, give me the heat.

18:21.178 --> 18:23.562
(spitting)

18:23.562 --> 18:26.229
Come on Billy, give me the heat.

18:27.215 --> 18:28.846
(spitting)

18:28.846 --> 18:30.763
Give me the heat Billy.

18:31.810 --> 18:32.643
Do it.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.450
(kicking)

18:38.450 --> 18:41.500
(spitting)

18:41.500 --> 18:42.500
What was that Billy?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.203
I told you to bring the heat.

18:45.380 --> 18:48.173
That was as cold as my
wife's chicken dinner.

18:49.544 --> 18:52.294
(birds chirping)

18:56.251 --> 18:58.751
(synth music)

19:14.020 --> 19:15.020
- Hey Billy.

19:16.025 --> 19:18.360
You look kind of bummed.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.330
- Yeah.

19:19.330 --> 19:21.380
Well you saw me stinkin' it up out there.

19:22.666 --> 19:25.040
I just wanted to impress Coache, you know?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
He's like the father figure I never had.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.060
- I got something that might help you out.

19:31.298 --> 19:32.360
- What is it?

19:32.360 --> 19:33.690
- Oh man, it's the best.

19:33.690 --> 19:36.680
It makes all the bad feelings go away.

19:36.680 --> 19:37.793
Makes you strong.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.170
One gulp of this and you're gonna be

19:40.170 --> 19:42.853
rolling heaters all nine innings.

19:44.927 --> 19:46.585
- Is it like a vitamin or something?

19:46.585 --> 19:48.835
(laughing)

19:52.440 --> 19:53.273
- Trust me.

19:53.273 --> 19:54.775
You're gonna love it.

19:54.775 --> 19:57.275
(synth music)

20:11.281 --> 20:14.031
(birds chirping)

20:15.310 --> 20:17.560
- [Coache] Come on,
Billy, bring me the heat.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.290
(dramatic music)

20:22.290 --> 20:23.683
- It makes you strong.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.800
One gulp of this and you're
gonna be rolling heaters

20:29.800 --> 20:32.140
all nine innings.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.473
- Billy, bring me the heat.

20:34.473 --> 20:36.010
Bring me the heat, Billy.

20:36.010 --> 20:36.929
Come on, Billy.

20:36.929 --> 20:37.858
Give me the heat.

20:37.858 --> 20:39.778
Come on Billy, bring me the heat.

20:39.778 --> 20:41.939
Bring me the heat.

20:41.939 --> 20:44.689
(dramatic music)

20:55.165 --> 20:57.302
(birds chirping)

20:57.302 --> 20:58.223
Give me the heat!

20:58.223 --> 20:59.102
Come on Billy!

20:59.102 --> 21:00.029
Bring me the heat.

21:00.029 --> 21:01.070
Bring me the heat.

21:01.070 --> 21:02.293
Bring me the heat.

21:02.293 --> 21:03.682
Bring me the heat, Billy.

21:03.682 --> 21:06.125
Bring me the heat, bring me the heat.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.285
Bring me the heat.

21:08.285 --> 21:10.607
Bring me the heat.

21:10.607 --> 21:13.224
Bring me the heat, Billy.

21:13.224 --> 21:15.205
Bring me the heat.

21:15.205 --> 21:16.705
Bring me the heat.

21:21.536 --> 21:23.703
(hitting)

21:25.489 --> 21:28.239
(Coache yelling)

21:29.111 --> 21:30.361
Why, Billy boy?

21:31.285 --> 21:32.821
Why?

21:32.821 --> 21:36.637
I was like the father
figure you never had.

21:36.637 --> 21:38.887
(laughing)

21:40.561 --> 21:41.561
- Oh my god.

21:42.580 --> 21:44.060
Oh, what have I done?

21:44.060 --> 21:45.321
- Oh.

21:45.321 --> 21:47.497
I'm getting cold.

21:47.497 --> 21:49.983
Colder than my wife's chicken dinner.

21:52.955 --> 21:55.370
(laughing)

21:55.370 --> 21:56.203
- No!

21:58.332 --> 22:02.249
(slow, melancholy piano music)

22:05.973 --> 22:07.763
Darn this Devil's Spunk.

22:09.270 --> 22:11.230
- Instead of Ivy League colleges,

22:11.230 --> 22:13.473
today's top students are ending up here.

22:16.270 --> 22:17.653
Cut down in their prime.

22:18.650 --> 22:20.750
It's up to you, America's parents.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.820
Will you let the Devil squirt his Spunk

22:22.820 --> 22:24.330
down your children's throats,

22:24.330 --> 22:26.123
rotting them from the inside out?

22:29.860 --> 22:31.300
Now that you know what's at stake,

22:31.300 --> 22:33.680
you can't afford to stop.

22:33.680 --> 22:34.930
In volume two of our series,

22:34.930 --> 22:36.480
we'll teach you everything
you need to know

22:36.480 --> 22:38.500
to keep your children safe,

22:38.500 --> 22:40.280
and to help them spit out

22:41.130 --> 22:42.403
the Devil's Spunk.

22:43.243 --> 22:45.743
(synth music)

22:50.697 --> 22:52.864
(beeping)

22:55.570 --> 22:57.780
- Hollywood has been
corrupting us every year

22:57.780 --> 23:00.200
with the smutty filth that they release

23:00.200 --> 23:03.710
custom made to sell soda
pop and hamburgers that'll

23:03.710 --> 23:06.230
cause you erectile dysfunction.

23:06.230 --> 23:09.440
How have they responded
to the Spunk epidemic?

23:09.440 --> 23:10.920
The same as always.

23:10.920 --> 23:12.223
They exploit it.

23:14.549 --> 23:17.920
I got this from documentary
filmmaker Luke Lesser

23:17.920 --> 23:20.880
and he's doing a film with
us on the Spunk epidemic.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.820
He did a shocking interview with director

23:22.820 --> 23:23.983
George Grisby.

23:25.143 --> 23:27.443
You're just gonna have
to see it for yourself.

23:29.524 --> 23:31.430
(static)

23:31.430 --> 23:33.380
- George Grisby, are you George Grisby?

23:33.380 --> 23:34.300
- Yeah, can I--

23:34.300 --> 23:36.490
- I'm here with Actual Factual Truths.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.730
We're making a documentary about Spunk.

23:38.730 --> 23:39.563
- That's great.

23:39.563 --> 23:41.150
Look, I was just going to get the mail.

23:41.150 --> 23:41.983
I'm gonna head back--

23:41.983 --> 23:42.816
- Your film, Spunk of the Reaper.

23:42.816 --> 23:44.870
What were you thinking making this?

23:44.870 --> 23:45.920
- What was I thinking?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.340
Well I think with any film,
there's always an element

23:48.340 --> 23:51.090
of character and, look,
why don't my people

23:51.090 --> 23:51.923
get in contact with your people?

23:51.923 --> 23:54.020
- Do you think it's
responsible to make a film that

23:54.020 --> 23:55.770
reinforces that Spunk is only a fiction?

23:55.770 --> 23:57.200
That it's a myth?

23:57.200 --> 23:58.810
- But it is a fiction.

23:58.810 --> 23:59.643
I mean...

23:59.643 --> 24:03.010
- Is it true that you used
real Spunk in this film?

24:03.010 --> 24:04.570
- Where did you hear that?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.920
- Is it true that this
film, you only made it

24:06.920 --> 24:09.300
to get connections in the Spunk industry?

24:09.300 --> 24:10.400
To get free Spunk?

24:10.400 --> 24:12.210
Is it true that you told
your assistant director,

24:12.210 --> 24:15.537
and I quote, "Give me all the
Spunk your mouth can hold?"

24:17.490 --> 24:18.700
- This interview's over.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.680
- Is it true that your
lead actress OD'd, and had

24:20.680 --> 24:22.610
to be replaced three times?

24:22.610 --> 24:23.920
- You know, you gotta be
really proud of yourself

24:23.920 --> 24:25.560
spreading this kind of
filth all over the place.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.640
- We have evidence.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.270
These are Actual Factual Truths.

24:28.270 --> 24:29.103
- That's great.

24:29.103 --> 24:29.936
Turn the camera off.

24:29.936 --> 24:30.769
- Evidence.
- Right now.

24:33.425 --> 24:35.675
(coughing)

24:41.239 --> 24:42.780
(chuckling)

24:42.780 --> 24:45.180
- That is the face of a man who is afraid

24:45.180 --> 24:46.290
of what he's about.

24:46.290 --> 24:49.530
He's afraid of admitting that
he has become a Spunk head.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.320
One of the converted.

24:51.320 --> 24:54.070
We've got a clip from
Grisby's filth that they think

24:54.070 --> 24:55.870
can tell us where Spunk comes from.

25:01.528 --> 25:04.247
(coughing)

25:04.247 --> 25:06.414
(chiming)

25:08.390 --> 25:13.390
(slow, dramatic music)
(waves crashing)

26:05.355 --> 26:10.355
(soft, dramatic music)
(people chattering)

26:26.690 --> 26:29.020
- [Vincent] I never seen a
Spunk sore like that before

26:29.020 --> 26:31.720
and I was friends with Mark
Cube Winters near the end.

26:32.570 --> 26:33.830
- Yeah, Dar.

26:33.830 --> 26:36.240
This here's the point of no return.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.740
From here on out, it's a
bullet train to oblivion.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.650
- Is this that Senor Dios shit?

26:41.650 --> 26:42.483
Mierda Fuertes.

26:43.350 --> 26:44.884
- Of course not.

26:44.884 --> 26:46.710
I got this shit in Tahiti.

26:46.710 --> 26:48.627
Ken Hurst Showers' connection.

26:48.627 --> 26:51.450
Mierda Fuerte is just now coming out.

26:51.450 --> 26:53.700
- Dio sold a half a key to Chaz Politeri.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.650
- Exactly.

26:54.650 --> 26:57.040
Fucking big shot in the Spunk world.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.140
- It's not that great.

26:59.463 --> 27:00.435
- What?

27:00.435 --> 27:01.590
- This stuff, it's nothing special.

27:01.590 --> 27:02.720
I can barely feel it.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.520
- Yeah, you always say that.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.420
You could be lying there
frothing at the mouth

27:06.420 --> 27:09.718
telling us that Senor Dios'
shit don't do fuck for you.

27:09.718 --> 27:10.650
(laughing)

27:10.650 --> 27:12.788
- Well now I gotta get some new shit.

27:12.788 --> 27:14.660
- How the fuck did you get here, man?

27:14.660 --> 27:16.500
I mean, you're shooting into an open sore

27:16.500 --> 27:17.930
on your fuckin' arm, you freak.

27:17.930 --> 27:20.432
- Yeah, you ought to get
that shit checked out.

27:20.432 --> 27:23.765
(footsteps approaching)

27:26.230 --> 27:27.080
- [Vincent] Fuck.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.383
- Maybe she wants some Spunk.

27:34.289 --> 27:35.450
You never know.

27:35.450 --> 27:36.460
It's everywhere, man.

27:36.460 --> 27:37.760
All walks of life.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.793
I'm tellin' ya.

27:40.120 --> 27:40.997
- Look at Darry.

27:40.997 --> 27:43.340
Hey Darry, buddy, you
should've went after her.

27:43.340 --> 27:45.250
- [Bill] That's right, Dar.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.190
Spunkers got a funny way of checking out

27:47.190 --> 27:49.260
when you least expect it.

27:49.260 --> 27:50.883
Seize these moments, man.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.040
You never know which
one could be your last.

27:57.090 --> 27:58.163
- Yes, Darry.

27:59.687 --> 28:01.350
There you go young man.

28:01.350 --> 28:03.060
- [Bill] Go forth!

28:03.060 --> 28:05.270
Lay seed, fine baller!

28:05.270 --> 28:07.520
(laughing)

28:09.024 --> 28:12.274
(dramatic synth music)

28:23.824 --> 28:26.210
- Hey, there, girl.

28:26.210 --> 28:27.043
You got a light?

28:32.080 --> 28:33.943
Hey, there, girl.

28:35.310 --> 28:38.883
I've got some Spunk for you.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.875
(slow, dramatic music)

28:59.280 --> 29:00.780
You're Lexi Twist, aren't you?

29:01.618 --> 29:03.380
- Who do I know you from?

29:03.380 --> 29:04.213
- My brother.

29:05.070 --> 29:07.420
My brother took you to prom senior year.

29:07.420 --> 29:08.720
- Michael Ferrero?

29:08.720 --> 29:09.553
- Yeah.

29:10.470 --> 29:12.160
You introduced him to Spunk.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.263
- Yeah, I know.

29:14.930 --> 29:15.797
How's he doin'?

29:17.200 --> 29:18.033
- Not great.

29:19.980 --> 29:21.680
- So you're Denny right?

29:21.680 --> 29:23.010
- Darry.

29:23.010 --> 29:23.863
- Darry.

29:33.220 --> 29:35.220
You got some Spunk for me, Darry?

29:35.220 --> 29:36.053
- Some Spunk?

29:37.410 --> 29:38.810
I mean yeah, I do.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.597
It's not great or anything, but--

29:43.520 --> 29:44.550
- What is that?

29:44.550 --> 29:45.383
- It's nothing.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.593
Fuck.

29:48.593 --> 29:49.426
- Shit.

29:50.420 --> 29:51.520
- It's not a big deal.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.030
- You're gonna fucking die.

29:55.350 --> 29:56.200
- Don't say that.

30:01.355 --> 30:04.688
(slow, dramatic music)

30:07.674 --> 30:10.424
(couple arguing)

30:19.880 --> 30:21.730
- You're on it right now, aren't you?

30:23.220 --> 30:25.000
This is a problem.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.400
- I can take it or leave it.

30:28.986 --> 30:30.086
- Why'd you follow me?

30:31.140 --> 30:32.950
- I don't know, I just,

30:32.950 --> 30:34.720
I remembered that one time
you came over to our house.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.360
I thought maybe you had
some Spunk or something.

30:36.360 --> 30:37.193
I don't know.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.150
- You're cuter than
your brother, you know.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.790
- [Darry] Where are you going?

30:46.790 --> 30:47.840
- My brother's party.

30:51.130 --> 30:52.180
You wanna be my date?

30:53.070 --> 30:53.903
- Date?

30:53.903 --> 30:55.440
- Uh huh.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.760
- What is it, a dinner party?

30:56.760 --> 30:57.910
- It's a cooking party.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.180
- But after the cooking
comes the eating, no?

31:01.180 --> 31:02.280
- We're cooking Spunk.

31:03.230 --> 31:04.953
- Well, I accept your invitation.

31:06.810 --> 31:08.010
- Let me do the talking.

31:08.864 --> 31:09.697
(punk rock music)

31:09.697 --> 31:10.690
- [Richard] Don't let it stick.

31:10.690 --> 31:11.850
- [Crystal] I know.

31:11.850 --> 31:14.040
- [Richard] I say that
because you hesitated.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.832
Tom's not getting back
until the Fourth, correct?

31:15.832 --> 31:17.040
- Correct.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.130
Richard, sit down.

31:19.130 --> 31:19.963
- Yoo hoo.

31:21.075 --> 31:23.908
(punk rock music)

31:25.290 --> 31:27.043
- [Richard] You don't
know how to cook anything.

31:28.096 --> 31:31.346
(slow, dramatic music)

31:33.950 --> 31:36.253
- I have a surprise for you, mommy.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.830
He's coming home tonight.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.649
(punk rock music)

31:46.404 --> 31:48.915
- [Richard] Lexi, what up?

31:48.915 --> 31:51.510
(slow, dramatic music)

31:51.510 --> 31:53.484
- [Lexi] I brought a friend.

31:53.484 --> 31:54.775
- You what?

31:54.775 --> 31:56.970
- This is the guy I was telling you about.

31:56.970 --> 31:59.023
He's here to test drive the new shit.

31:59.023 --> 32:01.070
- I thought that wasn't until Tuesday.

32:01.070 --> 32:01.903
- Tonight, Richard.

32:01.903 --> 32:02.803
I told you that.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.740
- He's younger than you made it seem.

32:05.740 --> 32:07.170
- He's young.

32:07.170 --> 32:08.433
But experienced.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.233
- [Richard] Hm.

32:11.610 --> 32:13.280
What's wrong with the arm?

32:13.280 --> 32:14.590
- It's nothing.

32:14.590 --> 32:16.450
I hurt it running across the street.

32:16.450 --> 32:18.645
There was a tire in the street--

32:18.645 --> 32:19.478
Ow.

32:19.478 --> 32:21.480
- Fuck, dude.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.380
I aint never seen that.

32:23.380 --> 32:25.010
Not that bad.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.370
Take a seat Spunky.

32:26.370 --> 32:27.633
Get ready to die young.

32:28.824 --> 32:31.430
(punk rock music)

32:31.430 --> 32:32.263
Excellent.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.320
What's your name, man?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.647
- [Darry] Darry.

32:36.647 --> 32:37.610
- Now, Darry.

32:37.610 --> 32:39.420
Your arm is seriously fucked.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.193
Way beyond reversible.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.060
- Okay.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.380
- I've seen videos of this short of thing,

32:44.380 --> 32:46.270
but never in person.

32:46.270 --> 32:48.700
My uncle Jimmy passed three months ago.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.400
His issues weren't half as bad as yours.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.353
You're shooting straight
into that thing, huh?

32:54.270 --> 32:57.103
My uncle Jimmy had his first
shot, he was just pphht.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.440
Gone.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.203
Never had a clear head after that.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.603
So when he started dying, he
wasn't able to deal with it.

33:07.730 --> 33:09.440
Hadn't prepped himself.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.543
Too high to ward off all the bad thoughts.

33:12.910 --> 33:14.110
Got real fuckin' scared.

33:15.940 --> 33:18.383
Never spent any of his
life thinking about death.

33:21.070 --> 33:22.083
You still got time.

33:23.060 --> 33:23.900
- Yeah.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.230
- But tonight?

33:25.230 --> 33:27.440
You're gonna get Spunked to the gils, kid.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.923
Ever heard of Mierda Fuerte?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.220
I thought so.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.123
Crystal, load up.

33:33.123 --> 33:36.700
(punk rock music)

33:36.700 --> 33:38.210
- Oh, Richard, I forgot something.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.720
- I think this is too much.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.180
- Nonsense, honey.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.013
Nonsense.

33:43.013 --> 33:44.360
- Richard.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.193
- Yeah, Lexi?

33:47.070 --> 33:48.470
- Tom's coming home tonight.

33:50.090 --> 33:51.030
- Tonight?

33:51.030 --> 33:51.863
What do you mean?

33:51.863 --> 33:54.180
- I mean tonight.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.013
Any time.

33:55.013 --> 33:56.670
- Well Jesus fucking Christ, like when?

33:56.670 --> 33:57.590
In a couple of hours?

33:57.590 --> 33:58.423
What?

33:58.423 --> 33:59.480
- I don't know.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.700
Any time.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.330
It could be any time.

34:02.330 --> 34:04.200
- I'm not gonna have the
batch done until Thursday.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.263
- [Lexi] Well you're just
gonna have to tell him that.

34:07.460 --> 34:09.030
- Yeah.

34:09.030 --> 34:10.000
- [Crystal] Jesus, Richard.

34:10.000 --> 34:10.949
- It's gonna be fine.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.820
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

34:12.820 --> 34:14.969
- Tom said not to use the phones.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.820
- Use a payphone!

34:16.820 --> 34:17.739
Fuck, Lexi!

34:17.739 --> 34:19.275
- It's not that big of a deal.

34:19.275 --> 34:20.109
- God!

34:21.505 --> 34:24.755
(slow, dramatic music)

34:29.230 --> 34:30.969
- Who's Tom?

34:30.969 --> 34:31.969
- [Lexi] My brother.

34:32.889 --> 34:34.679
- I thought he was your brother.

34:34.679 --> 34:35.513
- He's not.

34:37.264 --> 34:38.931
Well kind of, he is.

34:40.056 --> 34:41.159
- Yeah.

34:41.159 --> 34:42.764
Well, this has been fun and all,

34:42.764 --> 34:43.803
but not really what I was expecting.

34:43.803 --> 34:46.870
- Now I know you didn't
follow me for nothing.

34:46.870 --> 34:48.469
- You know what I came here for.

34:49.980 --> 34:53.230
(slow, dramatic music)

34:56.219 --> 34:58.845
Your mom is really freaking me out.

34:58.845 --> 35:00.740
- I thought you said you had
some Spunk for me, Darry.

35:00.740 --> 35:02.350
- I think you have better stuff here.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.116
- I want yours, big guy.

35:04.116 --> 35:04.949
- Jesus Lexi.

35:04.949 --> 35:06.560
Can you help me clean up a little?

35:06.560 --> 35:07.440
What if he came home right now?

35:07.440 --> 35:09.923
- He'll be mad at you, not me.

35:13.920 --> 35:14.860
- Fuck you!

35:14.860 --> 35:15.693
- Fuck you.

35:18.151 --> 35:20.901
(dramatic music)

35:51.561 --> 35:54.478
(speaking Spanish)

35:55.881 --> 35:57.225
- Hola.

35:57.225 --> 35:59.412
- [All] Hola, senor.

35:59.412 --> 36:02.880
(upbeat Spanish music)

36:02.880 --> 36:03.713
- Hi, mom.

36:04.780 --> 36:08.030
(upbeat Spanish music)

36:10.170 --> 36:11.440
Richard.
- Yeah, Tom?

36:11.440 --> 36:13.550
- Why the fuck are you
still cookin' the shit?

36:13.550 --> 36:15.820
- There was some
miscommunication as to when

36:15.820 --> 36:16.653
you were gonna be coming--

36:16.653 --> 36:18.590
(gunshot)

36:18.590 --> 36:20.270
- You couldn't just
hurry him along, Crystal?

36:20.270 --> 36:21.820
- I tried, Tom.

36:21.820 --> 36:23.907
Honest to God, I tried.

36:23.907 --> 36:26.074
(gunshot)

36:29.782 --> 36:32.840
- [Lexi] That is the loudest damn gun.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.810
- You get one chance
in this world, matones.

36:35.810 --> 36:37.513
And it's into the darkness you go.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.393
Who's the greaser?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.260
- This is our new test monkey.

36:44.750 --> 36:45.583
- Yeah?

36:50.630 --> 36:52.880
You gonna shoot or get
off the pot, pony boy?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.213
- I was,

36:57.400 --> 36:59.220
I'm actually not that guy.

36:59.220 --> 37:01.270
She just invited me in--
- Take it easy.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.043
Let me see that arm.

37:10.752 --> 37:14.002
(slow, dramatic music)

37:20.215 --> 37:23.132
(speaking Spanish)

37:25.930 --> 37:26.763
- I really,

37:28.020 --> 37:29.403
your sister lied to me.

37:30.271 --> 37:31.610
I didn't--

37:31.610 --> 37:33.400
I don't wanna be here.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.410
For any of this.

37:34.410 --> 37:36.580
- Well, you're here.

37:38.230 --> 37:40.630
And I've got everything
you've been waiting for.

37:41.820 --> 37:42.693
Hold still.

37:44.357 --> 37:47.607
(slow, dramatic music)

37:55.880 --> 37:58.260
You're already on your way out,

37:58.260 --> 38:01.143
so why not climb up onto the higher plain?

38:02.798 --> 38:06.048
(slow, dramatic music)

38:15.630 --> 38:16.843
He's feeling it, Lexi.

38:17.780 --> 38:18.823
Look at this fuck.

38:20.350 --> 38:22.690
Embrace the nothing, kid.

38:22.690 --> 38:24.790
It's only the transition that's troubling.

38:27.570 --> 38:29.630
We're trying to provide good citizens

38:29.630 --> 38:30.880
with a taste of oblivion.

38:32.000 --> 38:32.973
The warm shroud.

38:34.630 --> 38:37.270
That's how Mierda Fuerte's different.

38:37.270 --> 38:40.013
It holds your hand as you cross over.

38:45.310 --> 38:46.930
And once you cross that
chasm, you're one with

38:46.930 --> 38:47.863
everything else.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.420
(slow, dramatic music)

38:51.420 --> 38:53.327
So soak in the sensations now.

38:54.180 --> 38:56.973
You've only got one shot to die properly.

38:59.333 --> 39:02.583
(slow, dramatic music)

39:24.846 --> 39:27.096
(clicking)

39:28.453 --> 39:33.453
(disembodied voices)
(slow, dramatic music)

39:41.883 --> 39:43.120
- There's a unit out back.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.587
It's where Tom keeps all the stuff.

39:45.587 --> 39:47.750
If we take his car, we can
make a break for Mexico

39:47.750 --> 39:50.667
before anyone knows what happened.

39:50.667 --> 39:53.917
(slow, dramatic music)

39:57.016 --> 39:59.849
(heavy breathing)

40:01.164 --> 40:03.123
- Why did you bring me here?

40:03.123 --> 40:04.394
- Honey.

40:04.394 --> 40:06.144
You brought yourself.

40:08.052 --> 40:10.552
(gun cocking)

40:12.411 --> 40:13.244
Mom?

40:14.768 --> 40:19.768
(heavy breathing)
(sniffling)

40:25.306 --> 40:27.843
(gunshot)

40:27.843 --> 40:30.593
(dramatic music)

40:54.314 --> 40:57.564
(slow, dramatic music)

40:59.480 --> 41:02.563
(disembodied voices)

41:24.035 --> 41:29.035
(disembodied voices)
(slow piano music)

41:34.426 --> 41:39.426
(waves crashing)
(slow piano music)

41:57.005 --> 41:59.755
(waves crashing)

42:08.155 --> 42:10.905
(dramatic music)

42:17.442 --> 42:22.442
(sniffing)
(dramatic music)

42:23.847 --> 42:26.680
(deeply exhaling)

42:28.480 --> 42:31.070
- And it's not just the
drugs on the streets

42:31.070 --> 42:32.580
or the Hollywood elitists.

42:32.580 --> 42:34.953
It's a whole goddamn web of bullshit.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.920
Here to tell you more is Rufus,

42:37.920 --> 42:39.110
our had researcher.

42:39.110 --> 42:41.370
He's gonna give you the
straight poop, folks.

42:41.370 --> 42:42.853
Take it away, Rufus.

42:45.780 --> 42:47.040
- Spunk is evil.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.330
This, we know for a fact,
and it takes many forms,

42:49.330 --> 42:51.380
but what is the goal of this plan?

42:51.380 --> 42:53.260
Well we start with street crime.

42:53.260 --> 42:55.630
You know, the usual
government control methods.

42:55.630 --> 42:57.310
Then we have Spunk denial.

42:57.310 --> 43:00.500
That's Hollywood, news media,

43:00.500 --> 43:02.210
and millennials.

43:02.210 --> 43:05.170
Next, we have government,
and they are the true

43:05.170 --> 43:06.540
pushers of this drug because no matter

43:06.540 --> 43:08.320
where it came from, one
thing's for certain.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.300
They are using it on us.

43:10.300 --> 43:14.200
Drinking water, chem
trails, and weather control.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.680
Florida, America's wing,
has more to worry about

43:16.680 --> 43:18.940
than Viagra shortages this year.

43:18.940 --> 43:21.560
Now, what we have here clearly shows that

43:21.560 --> 43:25.070
Spunk is not only real,
but it is everywhere and...

43:29.500 --> 43:32.090
Jesus Christ, the Illuminati, of course.

43:32.090 --> 43:33.480
John, I need to look at my notes.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.680
This changes everything.

43:36.119 --> 43:38.286
(chiming)

43:44.699 --> 43:48.032
(soft orchestral music)

43:50.305 --> 43:52.555
(knocking)

43:53.423 --> 43:56.756
(soft orchestral music)

44:14.695 --> 44:16.310
- Oh, wow.

44:16.310 --> 44:17.560
Nice place you have here.

44:19.485 --> 44:22.818
(soft orchestral music)

44:25.640 --> 44:26.473
- Thanks.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.547
Costs an arm and a leg, but, uh,

44:31.226 --> 44:33.113
I really do like the location.

44:36.680 --> 44:38.130
- Wait, you have a room mate?

44:39.620 --> 44:41.780
It costs extra for two.

44:41.780 --> 44:43.450
I don't really mind if anyone watches

44:43.450 --> 44:45.450
as long as they don't do anything weird.

44:47.530 --> 44:48.793
- That's a spare bedroom.

44:50.630 --> 44:53.773
I've been thinking about getting
another room mate, but, uh,

44:54.755 --> 44:58.377
it's really hard to find
somebody you can trust, you know?

44:58.377 --> 45:00.460
- Yeah, I totally get it.

45:01.669 --> 45:04.002
(unzipping)

45:07.552 --> 45:08.385
- Drink?

45:09.540 --> 45:12.280
- I don't usually drink around clients.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.054
But, you seem pretty normal.

45:14.054 --> 45:16.250
(Elijah laughing)

45:16.250 --> 45:18.200
- Glad you think so.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.550
You should tell my ex that.

45:21.232 --> 45:23.860
(soft orchestral music)

45:23.860 --> 45:25.220
You mind if I partake?

45:25.220 --> 45:26.320
- [Chance] Not at all.

45:27.916 --> 45:28.890
(lighter igniting)

45:28.890 --> 45:30.933
You know, that shit makes me tired.

45:31.770 --> 45:32.883
Got anything else?

45:33.753 --> 45:37.086
(soft orchestral music)

45:39.475 --> 45:41.720
- I've got this stuff called Spunk.

45:41.720 --> 45:42.553
- Spunk?

45:43.650 --> 45:44.563
- Yeah.

45:45.860 --> 45:47.263
It's kind of like weed.

45:48.670 --> 45:51.093
I mean, you've had the
munchies before, right?

45:52.090 --> 45:56.370
On this, it's like a thousand times more.

45:56.370 --> 45:58.553
I mean, this shit's fucking insatiable.

46:00.100 --> 46:02.750
It's pretty expensive and pretty strong.

46:02.750 --> 46:03.583
- I'll pass.

46:04.850 --> 46:05.783
- [Elijah] Alright.

46:08.523 --> 46:12.390
(soft orchestral music)

46:12.390 --> 46:14.490
- You know, you're a lot better looking

46:14.490 --> 46:16.140
than most guys that have me over.

46:17.530 --> 46:20.423
And, this isn't a shitty
motel by the highway.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.593
Are you sure you need to
hire someone to fuck you?

46:26.335 --> 46:27.253
- The truth is,

46:28.810 --> 46:31.953
this is my first time ever
doing something like this.

46:33.953 --> 46:36.180
I could just really go for something with

46:36.180 --> 46:38.260
no strings attached.

46:38.260 --> 46:39.303
Is that bad?

46:40.410 --> 46:42.580
- I like no strings.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.180
How do you feel about no shirts?

46:49.957 --> 46:52.815
(dramatic music)

46:52.815 --> 46:55.242
(both sighing)

46:55.242 --> 46:56.075
Wow.

46:59.367 --> 47:01.310
I usually charge double
for that last thing

47:01.310 --> 47:03.193
you did there, but, damn.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.190
This isn't your first rodeo, is it?

47:08.063 --> 47:10.280
- I can't say that it is.

47:10.280 --> 47:12.693
- Well, practice makes perfect, I guess.

47:14.978 --> 47:19.978
Hey, do you mind if I use
your bathroom real quick?

47:20.132 --> 47:21.420
- Sure.

47:21.420 --> 47:26.075
Knock yourself out.

47:26.075 --> 47:29.325
(slow, dramatic music)

47:31.856 --> 47:32.848
(dramatic music)

47:32.848 --> 47:35.015
(gasping)

47:37.779 --> 47:39.946
(hitting)

47:42.099 --> 47:44.849
(dramatic music)

47:58.097 --> 48:00.264
(cutting)

48:05.437 --> 48:08.687
(slow, dramatic music)

48:23.602 --> 48:25.213
(laughing)

48:25.213 --> 48:26.498
"Knock yourself out."

48:26.498 --> 48:28.002
(laughing)

48:28.002 --> 48:30.348
I crack myself up sometimes.

48:30.348 --> 48:32.304
"Knock yourself out."

48:32.304 --> 48:34.554
That's a fucking great one.

48:35.450 --> 48:37.603
"Knock yourself out."

48:37.603 --> 48:41.322
"Knock yourself out."
(laughing)

48:41.322 --> 48:45.644
"Knock yourself out."
(laughing)

48:45.644 --> 48:50.644
'Cause you're knocked out.
(laughing)

48:51.147 --> 48:54.397
(slow, tinkling music)

49:02.040 --> 49:04.957
(soft jazzy music)

49:26.896 --> 49:29.646
(woman laughing)

49:32.257 --> 49:37.257
(people chattering)
(slow, dramatic music)

49:48.290 --> 49:50.050
You picked a beautiful spot on a bleak day

49:50.050 --> 49:52.059
to read a bleak novel.

49:52.059 --> 49:53.680
(laughing)

49:53.680 --> 49:55.430
- It was next on my list of books to read,

49:55.430 --> 49:58.195
and who doesn't love a
bleak novel on a bleak day?

49:58.195 --> 49:59.110
(chuckling)

49:59.110 --> 50:01.010
- If I'm gonna be reading
about the end of the world,

50:01.010 --> 50:03.710
I'd prefer to be at home in
a bathtub full of bubbles.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.490
Do you mind?

50:05.490 --> 50:06.323
- Sure.

50:09.430 --> 50:10.420
- I'm Elijah.

50:10.420 --> 50:11.410
- Madison.

50:11.410 --> 50:12.860
But everybody calls me Maddy.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.550
- How long is that list of yours, Maddy?

50:16.550 --> 50:19.500
- Unfortunately, it's growing
a lot faster than I can read.

50:20.770 --> 50:23.250
But, when you read all the
articles, it takes a lot

50:23.250 --> 50:25.031
longer to get through those Playboys.

50:25.031 --> 50:25.864
(laughing)

50:25.864 --> 50:28.240
- When I was in middle school,

50:28.240 --> 50:30.263
I read so many Playboy articles

50:30.263 --> 50:32.967
that I gave myself carpal tunnel syndrome.

50:32.967 --> 50:35.217
(laughing)

50:37.600 --> 50:39.440
On a good day, a book
like that can be finished

50:39.440 --> 50:40.390
in one sitting.

50:40.390 --> 50:42.300
Do you plan on being here all day?

50:42.300 --> 50:43.830
- I was just planning on coming here

50:43.830 --> 50:46.060
and taking in the sights
and sounds and seeing

50:46.060 --> 50:47.520
where my day takes me.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.353
What about you?

50:49.960 --> 50:52.000
- I like coming in here to draw.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.303
- [Maddy] What do you like to draw?

50:54.150 --> 50:55.203
- I've been, uh,

50:56.580 --> 50:58.800
working on things that don't move.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.350
Uh, maybe one day I'll be
able to capture movement.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.333
- I get it.

51:03.333 --> 51:05.570
When I was in college,
I took an art class.

51:05.570 --> 51:07.320
For an entire quarter, I stood there

51:07.320 --> 51:09.160
in front of canvas,
with paintbrush in hand,

51:09.160 --> 51:10.488
and somehow, I got worse.

51:10.488 --> 51:12.738
(laughing)

51:13.718 --> 51:14.551
- Oh.

51:17.730 --> 51:19.140
- Can I see some of your drawings?

51:19.140 --> 51:19.973
- Uh.

51:22.300 --> 51:23.980
No, it's really not--

51:23.980 --> 51:24.830
- [Maddy] Just a little peak.

51:24.830 --> 51:28.385
- No, it's really not
ready to be seen or...

51:28.385 --> 51:29.218
- [Maddy] Just a little?

51:29.218 --> 51:30.210
- No.

51:30.210 --> 51:31.043
I mean,

51:32.090 --> 51:33.090
no.

51:33.090 --> 51:33.923
Um...

51:35.420 --> 51:37.227
- I promise I won't say anything.

51:38.875 --> 51:39.708
- It...

51:40.577 --> 51:41.913
I'm gonna go.

51:43.540 --> 51:45.240
- It was nice meeting you, Elijah.

51:46.343 --> 51:49.420
(people chattering)

51:49.420 --> 51:50.520
- [Elijah] Maddy?

51:50.520 --> 51:51.353
- Yeah?

51:52.460 --> 51:54.323
- [Elijah] Would you like
to go out to dinner tonight?

51:55.480 --> 51:56.400
- Dinner sounds like fun.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.340
- Great.

51:57.340 --> 51:58.560
How does six sound?

51:58.560 --> 51:59.570
- It sounds perfect.

52:00.739 --> 52:02.656
- I'll see you tonight.

52:04.441 --> 52:07.524
(upbeat jazzy music)

52:16.818 --> 52:19.735
(lighter igniting)

52:22.585 --> 52:25.668
(upbeat jazzy music)

53:15.392 --> 53:18.475
(upbeat jazzy music)

53:28.213 --> 53:30.380
(zipping)

53:34.272 --> 53:37.855
(strange electronic music)

53:49.840 --> 53:51.230
Keep it down tonight, buddy.

53:51.230 --> 53:52.163
I got a hot date.

53:53.473 --> 53:57.056
(strange electronic music)

53:59.600 --> 54:00.433
Whiskey.

54:00.433 --> 54:01.526
- [Waiter] A whiskey.

54:01.526 --> 54:03.070
Alright.

54:03.070 --> 54:05.770
And, would you like to start
out with any appetizers?

54:05.770 --> 54:08.080
Like to hear our specials?

54:08.080 --> 54:08.950
- Sure.

54:08.950 --> 54:10.260
- [Waiter] We've got an egg flower soup,

54:10.260 --> 54:12.270
with a side of fava beans.

54:12.270 --> 54:13.500
Interest you at all?

54:13.500 --> 54:14.333
- No.

54:14.333 --> 54:15.469
Just the drink.

54:15.469 --> 54:16.302
- [Waiter] Alright.

54:16.302 --> 54:17.313
One whiskey coming up for ya.

54:21.652 --> 54:24.235
(door opening)

54:25.886 --> 54:30.886
(footsteps approaching)
(slow, dramatic music)

54:33.200 --> 54:34.033
- Hey.

54:37.545 --> 54:40.628
(soft, upbeat music)

54:53.379 --> 54:56.379
(muffled screaming)

54:57.414 --> 54:58.247
- Shh.

54:59.235 --> 55:02.235
(muffled screaming)

55:03.172 --> 55:04.005
Shh.

55:05.982 --> 55:09.488
(muffled screaming)

55:09.488 --> 55:11.260
You know it takes a
lot longer to bleed out

55:11.260 --> 55:13.919
than they make to look in the movies.

55:13.919 --> 55:16.690
Last time I cut some guy's dick off,

55:16.690 --> 55:19.130
he just sat there and cried and whined

55:19.130 --> 55:21.140
like a little girl for three hours

55:23.202 --> 55:25.452
before he finally bled out.

55:29.872 --> 55:34.872
(soft operatic music)
(muffled screaming)

55:41.710 --> 55:42.543
By the way,

55:44.430 --> 55:45.693
great spot for dinner.

55:47.940 --> 55:49.255
I'm sure by now you can tell that I'm

55:49.255 --> 55:51.679
not really into the drinks.

55:51.679 --> 55:54.679
But I sure appreciate the cocktails.

55:56.274 --> 55:58.785
You seemed like such a nice guy.

55:58.785 --> 56:03.785
(muffled screaming)
(soft operatic music)

56:06.656 --> 56:09.105
You really need to try

56:09.105 --> 56:10.145
(coughing)

56:10.145 --> 56:11.738
this Spunk stuff.

56:11.738 --> 56:12.571
I mean,

56:14.023 --> 56:16.345
why eat a cheeseburger
when you can eat a guy

56:16.345 --> 56:18.400
that you just met at the coffee shop?

56:18.400 --> 56:19.915
Am I right?

56:19.915 --> 56:24.915
(muffled screaming)
(soft operatic music)

56:41.609 --> 56:44.912
(staggered breathing)

56:44.912 --> 56:47.503
Oh yeah, it looks like
dinner's almost bled out.

56:49.900 --> 56:51.221
Hey.

56:51.221 --> 56:52.693
Thanks again for the drinks.

56:54.890 --> 56:57.343
You seemed like such a nice guy.

56:58.465 --> 57:01.632
(soft operatic music)

57:05.360 --> 57:08.090
(electronic music)

57:08.090 --> 57:10.590
- You're saying that you're
the last one, senator?

57:12.128 --> 57:13.679
- Everyone else is one of them.

57:13.679 --> 57:15.432
Everyone else is one of them.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.910
They're out to get me, John.

57:16.910 --> 57:17.970
They're everywhere.

57:17.970 --> 57:18.960
I sent the pictures.

57:18.960 --> 57:19.890
I sent them.

57:19.890 --> 57:21.120
You've got to get them out there.

57:21.120 --> 57:22.570
You've gotta get 'em out there.

57:22.570 --> 57:24.020
- My god, senator.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.610
You're saying that they have
control of the military?

57:26.610 --> 57:29.270
- It was a silent but deadly invasion.

57:29.270 --> 57:30.453
Their gonads.

57:31.430 --> 57:33.235
Their gonads.

57:33.235 --> 57:36.089
(slow, dramatic music)

57:36.089 --> 57:37.710
(gunshot)

57:37.710 --> 57:38.543
- Senator?

57:39.750 --> 57:41.370
Senator?

57:41.370 --> 57:42.203
Senator?

57:44.243 --> 57:45.243
Sweet Jesus.

57:50.211 --> 57:51.294
Their gonads?

57:53.155 --> 57:56.405
(slow, dramatic music)

58:10.193 --> 58:12.443
Sweet Mary mother of Jesus.

58:14.829 --> 58:18.220
(dramatic music)

58:18.220 --> 58:21.137
(lighter igniting)

58:22.021 --> 58:23.821
(lighter igniting)

58:23.821 --> 58:27.321
(upbeat electronic music)

58:35.109 --> 58:37.460
- What type of super hero would you be?

58:37.460 --> 58:39.280
- I think you mean what
kind of super powers

58:39.280 --> 58:40.320
would you want?

58:40.320 --> 58:41.950
- Oh.

58:41.950 --> 58:43.323
That makes more sense.

58:44.170 --> 58:45.670
- I would not be a super hero.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.000
People don't deserve my mercy.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.980
- You would be the best villain, Becky.

58:49.980 --> 58:51.437
- Yeah, I know, right?

58:52.530 --> 58:54.420
- I would be a super hero for sure.

58:54.420 --> 58:56.770
- Oh sweetie, I don't
think you'd last very long

58:56.770 --> 58:58.050
if you had powers.

58:58.050 --> 58:59.380
Probably end up with something like fire

58:59.380 --> 59:00.270
and blow yourself up.

59:00.270 --> 59:03.170
- Either that, or I'd have to kill you.

59:03.170 --> 59:04.670
Being a super villain and all.

59:07.590 --> 59:08.981
- I would heal people.

59:08.981 --> 59:11.810
- Oh, look at you wanting
to save the world.

59:11.810 --> 59:13.993
- When my mom was dying of cancer,

59:16.320 --> 59:19.353
I used to pray and pray
that I could heal her.

59:21.670 --> 59:23.770
It would be my way of making it up to her.

59:25.020 --> 59:26.220
- Well that took a turn.

59:27.069 --> 59:29.190
(door closing)

59:29.190 --> 59:30.183
- What was that?

59:31.469 --> 59:33.890
- [Becky] It was probably
just the pizza Abby ordered.

59:33.890 --> 59:35.420
- And they let themselves into the house?

59:35.420 --> 59:39.200
- Wait, I was the one that was
supposed to order the pizza?

59:39.200 --> 59:41.160
- You're kidding me, right?

59:41.160 --> 59:42.050
I'm dying right now.

59:42.050 --> 59:44.160
Like my body is literally
eating itself alive,

59:44.160 --> 59:45.770
I'm so fucking hungry.

59:45.770 --> 59:47.610
- [Abby] Well that's
what you get for putting

59:47.610 --> 59:50.230
me in charge of responsibilities.

59:50.230 --> 59:51.063
- Hold on.

59:52.749 --> 59:54.237
(growling)

59:54.237 --> 59:55.070
- Baby!

59:57.200 --> 59:58.380
- You scared the shit out of me.

59:58.380 --> 59:59.720
- Tonight's no boys allowed.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.553
- Easy now.

01:00:00.553 --> 01:00:01.863
And here, I brought you a gift.

01:00:04.865 --> 01:00:06.160
- I'm sorry about my cousin.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.810
He can be a little immature.

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:09.030
- A little?

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.863
- Relax.

01:00:09.863 --> 01:00:11.510
And here, I brought you a gift, too.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.733
- Nice, Spunk.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:18.630
- Sorry, what?

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.780
- You're kidding, right?

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.068
You don't know what Spunk is?

01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:22.700
- It's just like that pipe
you're smokin' over there.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.450
- I mean, I know what Spunk is, but,

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:27.220
why would someone wanna
take your orgasm juice

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.530
and turn it into a drug?

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:30.450
- That's uh, that's not how it works.

01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:32.110
- It is the way I do it.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:33.980
- What would make you think
I wanted that as a gift?

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.677
- Oh come on, all the
cool kids are doing it.

01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:36.730
All you have to do is open wide.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.530
I'll take care of the rest.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:40.100
- Xombie Spunk?

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.810
- Yeah it's this new strand.

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:43.050
I haven't tried it yet.

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:44.823
- But I heard that it's awesome.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.460
Do you wanna try it?

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.210
- Do I wanna put Spunk in my mouth?

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:52.610
Can I lick it off your body?

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:53.627
- Yeah, sure.

01:00:53.627 --> 01:00:54.460
- Alright.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.613
- Gross.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.590
- Oh, come on.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.092
It'll be fun.

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:03.160
- It's supposed to be a girl's night.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.280
No boys allowed.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.563
- Ugh, but, drugs and stuff.

01:01:08.803 --> 01:01:09.636
- Yeah.

01:01:09.636 --> 01:01:10.597
Drugs and stuff.

01:01:14.073 --> 01:01:17.323
(slow, dramatic music)

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:24.192
(bed squeaking)
(moaning)

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.200
- What kind of super power would you have?

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.493
I mean, like, if you could choose?

01:01:42.313 --> 01:01:43.670
I always thought I wanted to be invisible,

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:46.580
but not like in the pervy way.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.153
Just,

01:01:48.153 --> 01:01:50.150
I just didn't know who I was.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.350
I mean, until I met you.

01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:55.212
(electronic music)

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:58.129
I don't think this Spunk's working.

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:00.563
Lucy, you okay?

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.927
(electronic music)

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.330
Lucy, stop fuckin' around.

01:02:11.077 --> 01:02:14.380
(dramatic music)

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.762
(slow, dramatic music)

01:02:17.762 --> 01:02:20.179
(clattering)

01:02:22.354 --> 01:02:24.354
- What the hell is that?

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:26.600
(Lucy yelling)

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.433
- [Abby] Becky?

01:02:30.243 --> 01:02:31.243
- Where's my cousin?

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:33.483
- In there.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.180
- Baby, don't.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.013
- Give me a break.

01:02:37.013 --> 01:02:38.173
She's just tweakin'.

01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:41.525
You gotta move.

01:02:42.617 --> 01:02:46.670
(slow, dramatic music)

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:48.170
Hey, Lucy?

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:49.020
- What'd you see?

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.533
- Hey Lucy?

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.893
It's me, Guy.

01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:01.350
(growling)
(yelling)

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:02.455
- Guy?

01:03:02.455 --> 01:03:07.038
(ripping)
(squelching)

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:13.373
Oh fuck.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.344
I was just starting to like him.

01:03:18.344 --> 01:03:21.230
(door opening)

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:25.221
(slow, dramatic music)

01:03:25.221 --> 01:03:27.388
(gasping)

01:03:29.087 --> 01:03:30.187
(neck cracking)
- Oh.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.223
Wow, I feel so much better.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.210
- Lucy?

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:38.043
- Yeah?

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:39.863
- You okay?

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:42.230
- Yeah.

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:45.431
Sorry, the Spunk stuff made
me trip out or something.

01:03:45.431 --> 01:03:47.031
Did I do something embarrassing?

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.540
Why are you guys acting so weird?

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.113
What the fuck happened?

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.493
- You kind of,

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.423
you kinda ate him.

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:05.243
- Oh shit.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.120
I heard this could happen.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.100
- Excuse me?

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.012
- Well that's why they call it Xombie.

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:12.400
One in 10 people can turn into a zombie.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.233
- But there's only five of us.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.060
- Lucy, don't.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.893
- What am I gonna do?

01:04:18.893 --> 01:04:19.890
I can't call the police.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:20.723
- I can.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:22.670
What?

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.200
It's my house.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.740
My mom is going to kill me.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.443
- [Kathy] You are 25 years old.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.180
(gasping)

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.080
- Hey.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:32.960
Maybe he's okay.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.413
I won't have to go to jail.

01:04:36.371 --> 01:04:37.204
(screaming)

01:04:37.204 --> 01:04:38.037
- Lucy!

01:04:38.037 --> 01:04:38.870
No!

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:40.213
Abby!

01:04:40.213 --> 01:04:42.963
(dramatic music)

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.003
- Shit.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.479
(growling)

01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:58.351
Ugh.

01:04:58.351 --> 01:04:59.184
Seriously?

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.380
- Baby?

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.825
Are you okay?

01:05:05.825 --> 01:05:08.075
(growling)

01:05:10.576 --> 01:05:15.076
(grunting)
(growling)

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.052
- Somebody!

01:05:17.052 --> 01:05:18.230
Anybody, come on!

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:19.252
- Do we have to?

01:05:19.252 --> 01:05:20.210
- Abby!

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:21.540
- Maybe we can fix him.

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.678
He's still a person.

01:05:22.678 --> 01:05:24.094
- Oh my god, morality later.

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:25.467
Stabby stab now.

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:26.860
- I'm just saying.

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.693
- Be a fucking super hero.

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:35.370
- I just wanna heal people.

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:36.533
- Oh Jesus Christ.

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:38.430
Hey Guy.

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.356
Open wide.

01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:40.419
(squelching)

01:05:40.419 --> 01:05:42.669
(grunting)

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.057
(slow piano music)

01:05:56.081 --> 01:05:58.998
(lighter igniting)

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.583
Strength.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.360
- What?

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.060
- I think I'd pick super strength.

01:06:09.116 --> 01:06:10.513
- That's a good one.

01:06:11.508 --> 01:06:14.425
(slow piano music)

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.240
- I'm sorry about that.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.073
- It's okay.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.960
I think he was actually a drug dealer.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.530
- He was totally a drug dealer.

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.370
- Yeah, I buy all my drugs from him.

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:28.203
- Yeah.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:30.110
(sighing)

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.743
- I'm sorry for always
seeing the good in people.

01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:37.620
(soft piano music)

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.770
- Hey Kathy?

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:39.603
- [Kathy] Yeah?

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.150
- Did you say "open wide?"

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:44.930
- Yeah, you know, it
felt right in the moment.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:46.640
- It's just usually when
someone says open wide,

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.170
it's more of a mouth thing, like, ah.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.003
- Yeah.

01:06:49.003 --> 01:06:49.908
Yeah.

01:06:49.908 --> 01:06:50.741
I felt like I had a better chance of

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.548
hitting the brain through the eye.

01:06:52.548 --> 01:06:54.798
(growling)

01:06:57.089 --> 01:06:59.380
(thumping)

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.213
- What is that?

01:07:00.213 --> 01:07:01.140
- Shit.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.862
- You ready for this?

01:07:02.862 --> 01:07:04.450
- Do I really have a choice?

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:05.663
- I'm still high.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.033
Is that Lucy?

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.110
I thought she was dead.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.000
- She is dead.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.113
- Try to keep up, Abs.

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:19.093
Abby, I need you to open the door.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.780
- Hold on.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.740
I have to...

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.160
(grunting)

01:07:30.636 --> 01:07:33.563
(exhaling)

01:07:33.563 --> 01:07:36.813
(slow, dramatic music)

01:07:40.731 --> 01:07:41.564
Oh.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:43.993
- Ready?

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:45.803
- [Becky] Set.

01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:49.014
(growling)

01:07:49.014 --> 01:07:51.181
(yelling)

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.913
(soft orchestral music)

01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:05.410
- Now some of you at home,

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:06.710
I know you are skeptics.

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:09.000
That you think this is a passing thing,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.710
that it's just going to go away.

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:12.583
Well it isn't.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:15.230
Don't you understand?

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:17.990
They want us to be so
busy fighting each other

01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:19.939
that we won't even notice
when they take over

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:21.590
the whole goddamn fucking planet!

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.750
If you think this symbol
of America is enough,

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:32.783
you're wrong.

01:08:33.639 --> 01:08:34.979
(grunting)

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:36.560
(clattering)

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.910
If you think you can hide, you're wrong.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:41.920
If you think you can run far
enough away, you're wrong.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.885
They are demons from outer
space, and they are going

01:08:43.885 --> 01:08:45.493
to kill everyone.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.830
We know that video games are basically

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:53.779
programming us.

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:57.029
Why do you think they call
it computer programming?

01:08:57.029 --> 01:08:59.330
Murder simulators that
are turning our children

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:01.130
into raving lunatics.

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.853
This toy for kids is to
train them for the army.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.252
That's step one.

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:11.020
Step two,

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.113
add Spunk.

01:09:13.113 --> 01:09:15.196
(static)

01:09:17.139 --> 01:09:20.055
(video game music)

01:09:29.658 --> 01:09:32.576
(video game music)

01:09:41.685 --> 01:09:44.602
(video game music)

01:09:47.862 --> 01:09:50.029
(gunfire)

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:54.189
- [Lara] Marcus, can we
talk to you for a second?

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.022
- Hold on.

01:09:56.006 --> 01:09:58.923
(video game music)

01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:05.231
(birds chirping)

01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:06.064
What's up?

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.880
- I know what's been going on.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.050
- Nothing's been going on.

01:10:26.076 --> 01:10:26.909
I just,

01:10:26.909 --> 01:10:29.660
you know, I've been practicing.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.310
For the big Speed Run livestream.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.859
I'm just really focused right now.

01:10:34.859 --> 01:10:37.220
- It's not about the video games, Marcus.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:38.360
We know that's always been your thing.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.170
And you're really good at them.

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:43.530
And I'm not one to judge
with the D&D Saturdays

01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:44.970
every week.

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:46.650
- We know you're using Spunk.

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:47.730
- Bill.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:49.540
Not around Lance.

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.890
- I'm sorry, well what
am I supposed to say?

01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:53.860
That he's taking BS-128?

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.944
White Claudia?

01:10:54.944 --> 01:10:55.777
Chud?

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.573
This drug is tearing you apart.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.100
- Bill means well.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.350
We all do.

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.610
- It's not a big deal.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:05.626
I mean,

01:11:05.626 --> 01:11:06.459
I mean,

01:11:06.459 --> 01:11:07.610
it's just, I...
- Hey.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.150
Hey, look.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:10.700
When's the last time you slept?

01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:13.090
- Three days ago.

01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:14.290
- When did you last eat?

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.560
- Yesterday?

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.990
I think.

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.877
It's Friday, right?

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:19.710
The 10th?

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.493
- It's Tuesday, the 14th.

01:11:23.609 --> 01:11:25.059
- Look at your hands, Marcus.

01:11:26.576 --> 01:11:29.326
(birds chirping)

01:11:33.317 --> 01:11:35.900
(Bill sighing)

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.777
- It's time to unplug.

01:11:40.119 --> 01:11:42.663
The real world is here.

01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:44.736
And it misses you.

01:11:44.736 --> 01:11:46.486
And we miss you, man.

01:11:47.807 --> 01:11:49.974
- We miss you, Uncle Mark.

01:11:52.027 --> 01:11:53.944
- I miss you guys, too.

01:11:54.906 --> 01:11:56.489
I miss you so much.

01:11:57.859 --> 01:12:00.859
- Okay, so then what are you saying?

01:12:01.767 --> 01:12:02.684
- I'm done.

01:12:03.968 --> 01:12:05.718
I'm done using Spunk.

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:07.403
- Come here.

01:12:11.325 --> 01:12:12.325
You promise?

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.033
(cars passing by)

01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.749
- [Bill] You sure you wanna detox at home?

01:12:28.749 --> 01:12:29.790
- Yeah.

01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:30.640
It's better here.

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.810
The games, they'll,

01:12:34.061 --> 01:12:35.820
they'll help me get through it.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.230
It's better to have something to focus on

01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:38.680
rather than the crash, right?

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.860
- Have you dumped your stash yet?

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.693
- No, that's--

01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:44.884
(static booming)

01:12:44.884 --> 01:12:45.984
Did you just see that?

01:12:47.348 --> 01:12:48.181
- No.

01:12:48.181 --> 01:12:49.683
Is something there?

01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:54.073
- Just my imagination.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:57.089
- Right.

01:12:57.089 --> 01:12:59.256
(pinging)

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:02.693
- Alright.

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:10.060
(sighing)

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.520
- Seriously?

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.353
Condoms?

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.260
- That's how Boon likes to deliver it.

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:17.843
- Alright man.

01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.823
I'm here, buddy.

01:13:21.202 --> 01:13:23.320
(deeply inhaling)

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.153
- Yeah.

01:13:28.297 --> 01:13:30.547
(flushing)

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.613
It's done.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.330
- Well look at that.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:39.512
The winner is you.

01:13:39.512 --> 01:13:41.677
(pinging)

01:13:41.677 --> 01:13:43.977
Guess now is the hard part, right?

01:13:47.904 --> 01:13:52.385
(slow, dramatic orchestral music)

01:13:52.385 --> 01:13:55.135
(kettle blaring)

01:13:58.287 --> 01:14:02.722
(slow, dramatic orchestral music)

01:14:02.722 --> 01:14:04.972
(dripping)

01:14:06.793 --> 01:14:09.745
(slow, dramatic orchestral music)

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:13.944
(barfing)
(coughing)

01:14:13.944 --> 01:14:16.527
(rain falling)

01:14:18.585 --> 01:14:22.752
(slow, dramatic orchestral music)

01:14:23.696 --> 01:14:25.030
- I don't think I can do this, Lara.

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:27.200
- Hey, Mark, listen to me.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.730
You are doing this, okay?

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.116
You're doing it right now.

01:14:30.116 --> 01:14:31.210
It's,

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:32.660
okay, right now, it sucks.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:33.613
It's really hard, and I get that,

01:14:33.613 --> 01:14:35.640
but you've just gotta get
through this part, okay?

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.330
'Cause once you get past
it, everything is about

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:40.117
to get so much better for you.

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:42.530
You know you're like my favorite person

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:43.550
in the world, right?

01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:45.920
You are so smart and so funny,

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.610
and you care so much about other people.

01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:49.060
I just,

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.290
it killed me seeing what this Spunk

01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:52.323
has done to you man, because,

01:14:52.323 --> 01:14:54.560
because I miss my friend,
and I'm so excited

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.610
to get him back, okay?

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:57.203
You've got this.

01:14:58.265 --> 01:14:59.554
- Thanks.

01:14:59.554 --> 01:15:01.204
That means a lot coming from you.

01:15:02.241 --> 01:15:03.863
- That's what friends are for, right?

01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:08.540
- Yeah.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.560
Best friends.

01:15:12.224 --> 01:15:15.560
(slow, dramatic orchestral music)

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.477
(video game music)

01:15:21.527 --> 01:15:24.444
(video game music)

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:34.650
(rain falling)
(sirens blaring)

01:15:42.482 --> 01:15:46.649
(slow, dramatic video game music)

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:54.565
(knocking)

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.810
(groaning)

01:16:04.538 --> 01:16:06.788
(knocking)

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.840
- Shit, man.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.960
You look awful.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.970
- Go away, Boon, please.

01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:17.210
I feel asleep.

01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.513
- Hey don't be like that.

01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:20.764
I got that new stuff for ya.

01:16:20.764 --> 01:16:23.550
The one you were asking about last month.

01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:24.650
- Not interested.

01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:25.483
I quit.

01:16:25.483 --> 01:16:27.410
- Yeah, bullshit you quit.

01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:28.380
Don't be a cunt, trust fund.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.213
Let us in.

01:16:29.213 --> 01:16:30.130
- I'm not--
- Hey.

01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:32.630
You bugged me for weeks
for something bigger.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.730
Better.

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:34.593
I've got it.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.650
Now let me the fuck in.

01:16:39.985 --> 01:16:41.230
(clicking)
(dramatic music)

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:43.410
You've got it lucky, you know.

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:44.950
Trust fund kid.

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:46.910
Got to quit your job.

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:48.670
Play video games all day.

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.234
Look at you.

01:16:50.234 --> 01:16:52.887
You got your own house and everything.

01:16:52.887 --> 01:16:54.003
Got the life, huh?

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.963
But me?

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.220
I'm busting my ass trying to stay alive.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.090
And it's up to people like you,

01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:03.093
paying customers, to keep me alive.

01:17:03.971 --> 01:17:05.720
Come on man.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:06.553
Help me out.

01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:09.463
Now,

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.543
I've got this good shit.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.690
Best Spunk you've ever tasted.

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:17.993
That's crazy good stuff.

01:17:20.246 --> 01:17:23.470
You told me about
overclocking my PC, but this?

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:24.770
Will overclock your brain.

01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:29.152
(slow, dramatic music)

01:17:29.152 --> 01:17:30.800

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:38.119

01:17:38.119 --> 01:17:38.952
No!

01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:39.785
No, please!

01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:40.618
Don't!

01:17:40.618 --> 01:17:41.451
Stop!

01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:43.001
Please, don't.

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:46.951

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.833
What now?

01:18:10.694 --> 01:18:12.180
- You know what?

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:13.030
Too much trouble.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.110
Let's take what we can get and book it.

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.943
- Sweet.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.093
I get dibs on that
original Legend of Zelda.

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:22.200

- [Narrator] Marcus wins.

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.263
Perfect victory.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.073
Killer instinct.

01:20:35.153 --> 01:20:37.263
It's all a fucking game.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:41.780

01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:45.900
Hey, what's up?

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.420
- [Lara] Help me.

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.673
Marcus, we're under attack.

01:20:49.673 --> 01:20:51.200
Please, hurry.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.497
- I'm on my way.

01:20:53.571 --> 01:20:57.238

01:21:57.343 --> 01:22:01.353

quest ends, Poopy Boy.

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:04.224

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.560
Why'd you do it, Simon?

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.000
Why'd you turn evil?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.930
You were sensible.

01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:33.766
- There's a secret to everybody.

01:22:33.766 --> 01:22:34.599

Hey.

01:24:52.508 --> 01:24:53.341
Aunt Patty?

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.073
She has cancer?

01:24:57.915 --> 01:24:59.240
Oh, my god.

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:01.264
Hey listen, I'm kind of
in a battle right now.

01:25:01.264 --> 01:25:02.860
Can I call you back?

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.973
I will call you back right

(slow, dramatic music)

01:27:03.155 --> 01:27:04.405
Is that for me?

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.393
Come now.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Surely you wouldn't kill your own child.

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:16.603
- What about Nate, you--
- Shh.

01:27:18.043 --> 01:27:19.323
Nate was a mistake.

01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:23.717
I thought he could give me what I needed.

01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:25.813
But I was wrong.

01:27:28.777 --> 01:27:30.093
Nate's a child.

01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:32.972
Weak.

01:27:32.972 --> 01:27:35.722

01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:51.457

Marcus.

01:29:43.761 --> 01:29:45.393
Marcus, you don't have to do this.

01:29:45.393 --> 01:29:46.281
You don't have to do this.

01:29:46.281 --> 01:29:47.114
Stop, please.

(squelching)

01:30:18.349 --> 01:30:21.599
(slow, dramatic music)

01:30:32.926 --> 01:30:34.676
- [Narrator] You win.

01:30:35.902 --> 01:30:37.152
New high score.

01:30:38.486 --> 01:30:41.986
(upbeat video game music)

01:30:46.144 --> 01:30:46.977
Game over.

01:30:51.094 --> 01:30:54.388
(deeply exhaling)

01:30:54.388 --> 01:30:55.221
- I win.

01:31:02.405 --> 01:31:04.950
(laughing)

01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:06.803
I got the high score, bitch.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.685
High score.

01:31:09.685 --> 01:31:12.224
(laughing)

01:31:12.224 --> 01:31:14.807
(woman crying)

01:31:16.415 --> 01:31:18.230
(slow, dramatic music)

01:31:18.230 --> 01:31:21.610
- All day I've been
telling you about Spunk.

01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:24.373
About how dangerous it is, but,

01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:29.533
well, people are blinded by complacency.

01:31:29.533 --> 01:31:30.470
They don't listen.

01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:32.410
They won't act.

01:31:32.410 --> 01:31:35.060
And that's why I do this show.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:39.230
That's why I put my ass
on the line everyday.

01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:40.900
I can't sleep.

01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.230
I haven't eaten in two days.

01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:46.710
And all because I see this
great country Spunking itself

01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:48.610
into oblivion.

01:31:48.610 --> 01:31:51.520
I have here, from some anonymous tipster

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.163
that I've been corresponding
with for the last year,

01:31:56.918 --> 01:31:59.557
an honest to god Spunk sample.

01:32:01.730 --> 01:32:03.727
And he says here,

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:07.677
"There are traces of
actual alien DNA in this,

01:32:07.677 --> 01:32:11.213
"along with synthetic GMO pig fat,

01:32:12.977 --> 01:32:15.737
"and unholy water that
was demonically possessed

01:32:15.737 --> 01:32:18.733
"by the monks of Aleister
Crowley's Manson Clan."

01:32:24.710 --> 01:32:26.510
And it came with these instructions.

01:32:28.215 --> 01:32:31.465
(slow, dramatic music)

01:32:34.598 --> 01:32:36.289
- [Man] John Oak.

01:32:36.289 --> 01:32:38.300
Jonathan Nigel Oakwell.

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:41.910
This is the voice of the Xenuvians.

01:32:42.906 --> 01:32:45.590
You are now under our control.

01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:46.930
- Yes Master Xeuvian.

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:50.016
- [Man] At the sound of the bell,

01:32:50.016 --> 01:32:52.798
you will be under my control.

01:32:52.798 --> 01:32:55.263
(chiming)

01:32:55.263 --> 01:32:57.862
You are not holding Spunk.

01:32:57.862 --> 01:33:00.347
Spunk does not exist.

01:33:00.347 --> 01:33:03.564
You have deluded yourself,
and your audience.

01:33:03.564 --> 01:33:05.003
There is no connection between any

01:33:05.003 --> 01:33:07.233
murders and Spunk.

01:33:07.233 --> 01:33:10.472
What is in your hand is
your own seminal fluid.

01:33:10.472 --> 01:33:13.851
You are going to open the condom.

01:33:13.851 --> 01:33:15.819
You are going to ingest it,

01:33:15.819 --> 01:33:18.652
and it will taste like your semen.

01:33:22.495 --> 01:33:23.457
Yes.

01:33:23.457 --> 01:33:24.290
That's good.

01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:26.794
Swirl it in your mouth like that.

01:33:26.794 --> 01:33:29.082
Daddy likes seeing you take it.

01:33:29.082 --> 01:33:31.999
Now swallow like a good little boy.

01:33:33.411 --> 01:33:35.457
I am going away now.

01:33:35.457 --> 01:33:37.307
At the sound of the seventh bell,

01:33:37.307 --> 01:33:40.720
you are going to tell
your audience these words:

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.910
Spunk is dead.

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:45.378
Spunk is dead.

01:33:45.378 --> 01:33:46.974
It was all a lie.

01:33:46.974 --> 01:33:49.131
It was all a lie.

01:33:49.131 --> 01:33:52.099
Do you understand, John Oak?

01:33:52.099 --> 01:33:53.795
- Yes, daddy.

01:33:53.795 --> 01:33:56.492
- [Man] You have done
your part in this plan.

01:33:56.492 --> 01:33:59.203
After you have made this
public announcement,

01:33:59.203 --> 01:34:01.703
you will burn your house down.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:03.643
- Yes, daddy.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.247
(chiming)

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.387
(chiming)

01:34:11.683 --> 01:34:13.850
(chiming)

01:34:14.687 --> 01:34:16.854
(chiming)

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:27.659
(punk rock music)

01:34:54.491 --> 01:34:57.851
- [Reverend Raymond] The Devil's Spunk.

01:34:57.851 --> 01:35:00.351
(synth music)

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:17.466
(static)

01:35:17.466 --> 01:35:20.403
(soft music)

01:35:20.403 --> 01:35:22.388
- [Darry] Why did you bring me here?

01:35:22.388 --> 01:35:25.471
- [Lexi] Honey, you brought yourself.

01:35:29.737 --> 01:35:32.100
- [Bill] This here's
the point of no return.

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.600
From here on out, it's a
bullet train to oblivion.

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:42.330
- [Tom] We're trying to
provide good citizens with

01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:43.403
a taste of oblivion.

01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:45.583
The warm shroud.

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:49.900
That's how Mierda Fuerte's different.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.720
It holds your hand as you cross over.

01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:55.700
And once you cross that chasm,

01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.300
you're one with everything else.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.273
So soak in the sensations now.

01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:03.973
You've only got one shot to die properly.

01:36:06.395 --> 01:36:09.895
(strange, tinkling music)

01:36:29.106 --> 01:36:31.939
(synth pop music)

01:36:52.132 --> 01:36:55.632
(upbeat video game music)

01:37:34.187 --> 01:37:36.739
(static)

01:37:36.739 --> 01:37:39.489
(dramatic music)

01:37:55.761 --> 01:37:59.428
(dramatic electronic music)
