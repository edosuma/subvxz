do you want our help?

- Steven, just stop.

Why isn't he waking up?

We don't know how long his brain

10:13.780 --> 10:15.747
was deprived of oxygen.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.182
If it was longer than
five minutes,

10:17.183 --> 10:18.616

in brain damage.

No.

to wait and see if he wakes up.

38:58.036 --> 39:02.972
So, you, uh, you got the job?

39:02.974 --> 39:05.542
If I want it.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.377
Is that gonna be a problem
for us if I take it?

39:07.379 --> 39:09.679
If it is,
are you gonna turn it down?

39:13.051 --> 39:16.386
I appreciate your saving my ass
and covering for me.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.387
I do.

39:17.389 --> 39:21.524
It's just, um...

39:21.526 --> 39:25.028
I'm just starting
to get on my feet here.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.396
[ Voice breaking ]
And with your coming back,

39:26.398 --> 39:30.667
it'll be like high school
all over again,

39:30.669 --> 39:33.370
where you are
the star quarterback

39:33.372 --> 39:36.940
and I am the water boy...

39:36.942 --> 39:41.044
Invisible in your shadow.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.413
Not possible.

39:43.415 --> 39:44.748
I've heard how the doctors
and nurses

39:44.750 --> 39:46.416
around here talk about you.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.752
You're smart, sensitive...

39:48.754 --> 39:50.053
Good listener.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.390
[ Sighs ]

39:53.392 --> 39:55.392
You don't know how good you are,
do you?

39:55.394 --> 39:56.860
Oh, are you kidding me? I
screw up in there all the time.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.829
Yeah, that's not
what I'm talking about.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.932
I mean, good.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.403
Okay?

40:06.405 --> 40:08.171
Look...

40:08.173 --> 40:11.708
Everything you need to know
to be a doctor...

40:11.710 --> 40:14.878
You can learn,

40:14.880 --> 40:16.613
except
for what you were born with.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.419
You are good, man.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.754
Good.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.556
Okay?

40:26.558 --> 40:27.657
Okay.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.993
[ Sniffles ]

40:29.995 --> 40:31.928
Come on, beer's on you.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.530
- [ Laughing ] Okay.
- Yeah?

40:33.532 --> 40:37.066
That's the deal.

40:45.210 --> 40:48.077
Sorry I canceled, but...

40:48.079 --> 40:49.829
I brought in
the new attending today,

40:49.830 --> 40:51.580
and I needed to hang around
and watch him.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.119
Paul:
You needed to, or you wanted to?

41:00.025 --> 41:03.059
What's the difference?

41:03.061 --> 41:05.595
Well, the difference is the very
reason you're here, isn't it?

41:12.204 --> 41:14.671
Let me ask you something.

41:14.673 --> 41:18.475
Will therapy make me feel
any better?

41:18.477 --> 41:20.076
Not if it's working.

41:24.216 --> 41:27.183
Let me ask you something.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.018
Are you really ready
to walk away from

41:29.020 --> 41:30.720
a job that is your whole life?

41:33.225 --> 41:35.792
That's the very reason I'm here.
