in some retirement home

the richest man alive, but...

Ah, fuck,
I should've known.

I kept quiet.

I'm not with state.

-I just-- I just--

-Huh?
-I just need your help.

29:36.222 --> 29:39.432

-I have to save my company.

29:39.467 --> 29:41.883
-For what?
-For-- For my family.

29:41.918 --> 29:44.817
See, and it all rests
on CHIP.

29:44.852 --> 29:46.888
Who told you
I invented CHIP?

29:46.923 --> 29:47.993
No one, I swear.

29:48.027 --> 29:49.649
See, uh-- Uh--

29:49.684 --> 29:52.169
I was at my doctor's,
and she reminded me

29:52.204 --> 29:54.206
about "Premium 3."
Now, I didn't think

29:54.240 --> 29:57.519
anything of it at the time,
but suddenly it dawned on me.

29:57.554 --> 29:59.038
Like a sign from above.

29:59.073 --> 30:01.730
You know,
it all clicked.

Okay, how we all doin' today?

30:07.184 --> 30:09.808
Let me first just say,
congratulations to you both.

30:11.257 --> 30:12.741
Thank you.

30:12.776 --> 30:15.641
Your accomplishment
is very rare these days.

30:18.195 --> 30:19.852
I mean, I'm not sure
that you're aware,

30:19.887 --> 30:21.647
but we are experiencing

30:21.681 --> 30:23.476
a massive decline
in population

30:23.511 --> 30:24.857
over the last few decades.

30:24.892 --> 30:26.790
You know, people
aren't getting married anymore.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.481
They're barely having sex.

30:28.516 --> 30:31.830
Fewer and fewer
want the responsibility

30:31.864 --> 30:34.487
or the burden
or raising real children.

30:34.522 --> 30:35.868
Yeah, well, we know.

30:35.903 --> 30:37.663
My-my husband
works for Tech Broker,

30:37.697 --> 30:39.596
so he's at the very forefront

30:39.630 --> 30:41.563
of the technological
revolution.

30:41.598 --> 30:43.186
I wouldn't expect you,

30:43.220 --> 30:44.912
out of all people,
to father three children.

30:44.946 --> 30:47.086
No, you see, for me,
it's the exact opposite.

Knowing the risks
has made me aim much bigger,

30:51.988 --> 30:54.749
We love the sound
of that here at State.

30:54.783 --> 30:57.510
You know, I think
all those people
out in the realm,

30:57.545 --> 30:59.719
they forget that
they still need
their physical bodies

30:59.754 --> 31:02.653
in order to experience
everything that they do there.

31:02.688 --> 31:05.656
I, for one,
am a true believer

31:05.691 --> 31:08.211
that nothing can replace

31:08.245 --> 31:10.523
the true sense of touch.

31:11.283 --> 31:12.974
The warmth.

31:24.572 --> 31:27.023
With all due respect,
what's this about?

31:27.057 --> 31:28.783
State is very aware

31:28.817 --> 31:31.613
of the many challenges
that today's would be parents

31:31.648 --> 31:32.994
are facing, and as such,

31:33.029 --> 31:35.134
State is highly committed

31:35.169 --> 31:38.897
to ensuring that
our plant survives
in good order

31:38.931 --> 31:41.106
for the many future generations
to come.

31:41.140 --> 31:43.832
So what, is there
some kind of allowance?

31:43.867 --> 31:45.834
No. Heh. No.

31:45.869 --> 31:47.043
Nothing like that, Mrs. Bird,

31:47.077 --> 31:48.216
though our name may deceive you.

31:48.251 --> 31:49.769
We put together a program

31:49.804 --> 31:52.048

the future well being

31:52.082 --> 31:53.670

31:53.704 --> 31:55.223
It's called "Premium 3."

and spearheaded

31:57.812 --> 31:59.918
by our very own
chief genetic engineer.

What, Donald Stein?

32:01.160 --> 32:02.782
Him and no other...

32:02.817 --> 32:04.715
You invented "Premium 3."

32:04.750 --> 32:05.993
And even before,
you were right there.

from the very beginning,

How did you find me?

32:35.712 --> 32:38.370

this roam tracker.

for virtual X-rays

more than one identity.

the smartest man alive,

you went mad,

by your paranoia,

out the door.

your damn business,

and you tell me what
all this has to do
with CHIP.

33:34.253 --> 33:36.945
So how exactly does it work?

33:36.980 --> 33:39.086
Well, you both fill out
an application.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.158
Now, the application allows
for a little bit of leeway,

33:42.192 --> 33:44.332
not too much,
but the idea being

33:44.367 --> 33:46.748
to satisfy
the remaining mournful spouse,

33:46.783 --> 33:48.095
there is a little leeway.

33:48.129 --> 33:50.062
What do you mean, leeway?

33:50.097 --> 33:52.720
You can tailor
your insurance spouse,

33:52.754 --> 33:55.102
a bit, so that
maybe they come back

for example.

how much you love her,

was anything, well,

a little bit of leeway.

But "augmented
pigmentation"

35:49.423 --> 35:50.458

All the choices you gave us

35:52.426 --> 35:53.944

things that we could train
to do better,

35:58.225 --> 35:59.950

something in the process.

any different.

38:47.532 --> 38:50.328
I want them to love me
as I am.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.053
And that is
completely relatable,

38:52.088 --> 38:53.365
of course it is.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.125
I've been there.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.335
And what I needed
to cure that

38:57.369 --> 39:01.511
was a smartly constructed
virtual lover.

39:05.653 --> 39:09.277
You had a virtual lover too?

39:17.734 --> 39:19.322
It's not what you think.

39:20.288 --> 39:22.221
Well then,
what is it?

39:25.466 --> 39:28.538
It's just an avatar.

39:28.573 --> 39:30.126
It's not a real woman.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.646
She doesn't exist.

39:34.095 --> 39:35.580
REENA:
But she does exist, right?

39:35.614 --> 39:37.340
In your mind,
she exists.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.238
You think of her
when you have a hard-on.

39:39.273 --> 39:40.757
Her, not me.

39:40.792 --> 39:42.449
Well, what about you?

39:42.483 --> 39:44.174
I mean,
when was the last time

39:44.209 --> 39:46.107
-you even looked at me?
-[SCOFFS]

39:46.142 --> 39:47.695
Have you looked
at me lately?

39:47.730 --> 39:51.803
Yeah! And I see
a beautiful 37-year-old woman

39:51.837 --> 39:54.392
who can easily be
10 years younger.

39:55.703 --> 39:57.602
Then I think to myself,
for all this expensive

39:57.636 --> 39:59.362
skin care regimen,
what's it for?!

39:59.397 --> 40:00.743
I mean, you never
leave the house.

40:00.777 --> 40:02.503
It's certainly
not for me.

40:02.538 --> 40:05.299
Oh, my God, you think
that I have someone?

40:05.333 --> 40:08.095
Is that
such a crazy idea?

40:08.129 --> 40:09.372
You're pathetic.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.478
I'm pathetic?

40:11.512 --> 40:15.136
[SCOFFS]
I sacrifice

40:15.171 --> 40:17.415
everything for you,
for us.

40:17.449 --> 40:21.211
You didn't sacrifice shit!
You just gave up.

40:21.246 --> 40:24.283
And then you used me
and the kids as an excuse.

40:24.318 --> 40:25.802
What, you think
that I didn't have dreams,

40:25.837 --> 40:28.460
that all I wanted was
just to be a stay-at-home mom?

40:28.495 --> 40:29.806
Wait, enlighten me, Reena.

40:29.841 --> 40:31.221
What was your big dream again?

40:31.256 --> 40:34.155
Because I don't
really remember.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.641
All you ever do
is dive on the realm.

40:36.675 --> 40:39.229
I don't even know
if that counts as being home.

40:39.264 --> 40:41.853
That's where
your kids are, asshole.

40:41.887 --> 40:44.856
You know, they don't want
to play soccer or catch.

40:44.890 --> 40:47.134
I meet them there
and you could've done the same

40:47.168 --> 40:48.515
if you wanted
to spend time with them,

40:48.549 --> 40:49.792
instead of wasting it

40:49.826 --> 40:52.311
on this stupid
realm order whore.

40:53.899 --> 40:55.591
I didn't mean
to hurt you, Reena.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.282
[SCOFFS]

40:59.249 --> 41:01.804
I just needed some comfort.

41:04.876 --> 41:06.291
So...

41:06.325 --> 41:07.810
Unhappy.

41:10.813 --> 41:12.331
Have you
ever considered

41:12.366 --> 41:14.541
that by going
against the current,

41:14.575 --> 41:17.440
you're making
yourself unhappy?

41:17.475 --> 41:20.201
Don't you think
there's a reason
they invented Lithium X?

41:20.236 --> 41:22.203
You, you say
you hate the realm,

41:22.238 --> 41:23.688
but you choose to sleep
through the night

41:23.722 --> 41:26.276
when the few people
you can actually engage with

41:26.311 --> 41:27.450
are awake?

41:27.485 --> 41:28.900
Of course you're lonely.

41:28.934 --> 41:32.144
You'll never be happy
until you accept the fact

41:32.179 --> 41:34.457
that there is nothing
too exceptional about you.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.217
You're just average.

41:36.252 --> 41:38.150

-But that's okay,

41:38.185 --> 41:40.428
'cause I-I like average.

41:40.463 --> 41:41.878
Average is stable.

41:41.913 --> 41:43.535
You can count on
average.

41:43.570 --> 41:46.400
Is that what you asked for
if I die?

41:47.539 --> 41:50.749
The most average version of me?

41:52.337 --> 41:54.235
'Cause I have
a hard time believing that.

41:54.270 --> 41:57.584
You're fucking impossible,
do you know that?

Look, if you want
to stay with me,

42:04.383 --> 42:06.247
you're gonna have
to delete her.

42:07.594 --> 42:08.733
I want to be on the realm

42:08.767 --> 42:12.219
and I want
to see you delete her.

42:12.253 --> 42:15.498
Either that, or you get
yourself a good lawyer.

42:23.264 --> 42:24.576
I won't--
I won't do it.

42:25.715 --> 42:27.406
I can't.

42:27.441 --> 42:31.272
I get that you want
to make me feel small,

42:31.307 --> 42:33.585
but I can't let you
kill our trust.

After what you've done,
you want me to trust you?

42:39.626 --> 42:41.351
That is a big laugh.

42:41.386 --> 42:43.250
Look, if we can't trust
each other, then we're doomed.

42:43.284 --> 42:45.217
It doesn't matter what
I do, we're doomed.

42:45.252 --> 42:47.737
How can I trust you
when you won't even
delete a stupid avatar

42:47.772 --> 42:49.601
-to show me that you care?
-It's not about that!

42:49.636 --> 42:51.396
It's about the fact that
you need the validation

42:51.430 --> 42:53.467
that you don't trust me
not to do it again!

42:53.501 --> 42:55.573
-I don't trust you.
-Then what's the point?!

42:55.607 --> 42:56.781
You cheated on me!

42:56.815 --> 42:59.404
I used a sex doll.
Hardly cheating!

42:59.438 --> 43:01.613
There was AI avatar

of that sex doll.

the amount of hours
on the realm that you do--

That pain that you're feeling,
that existential dread,

1:15:41.813 --> 1:15:45.230
as a total newcomer
to this world,

1:15:45.264 --> 1:15:47.612
I can tell that...

1:15:47.646 --> 1:15:50.442
these are difficult times
for you people.

1:15:52.996 --> 1:15:55.965
You know, when I was
on my way over here,

1:15:55.999 --> 1:15:58.312
I thought about myself
transforming

1:15:58.346 --> 1:16:01.418
into flesh and blood,

1:16:01.453 --> 1:16:04.490
and I had
this funny question.

1:16:04.525 --> 1:16:05.871
Take you, for example.

1:16:05.906 --> 1:16:07.632
You were naturally conceived.

1:16:07.666 --> 1:16:09.530
You're human and you think.

1:16:09.565 --> 1:16:11.808
You have
consciousness, but...

1:16:11.843 --> 1:16:14.224
what about the cells
that make up your body?

1:16:14.259 --> 1:16:17.503
Are they conscious
of being part of you?

1:16:17.538 --> 1:16:20.437
I think they're programmed
to scratch an itch,

1:16:20.472 --> 1:16:22.370
and they have no knowledge
they're part

1:16:22.405 --> 1:16:25.270
of this bigger thing
called Adam Bird.

1:16:26.547 --> 1:16:29.205
So... So what is
your question?

1:16:30.447 --> 1:16:33.002
Maybe, just maybe,

1:16:33.036 --> 1:16:35.625
you're just a cell too,
Adam.

1:16:38.524 --> 1:16:40.975
Like you think you have
this whole meaningful life,

1:16:41.010 --> 1:16:43.322
but in the end,
all you really are

1:16:43.357 --> 1:16:46.015
is a small cell
in God's own body.

1:16:46.049 --> 1:16:48.534
You would think there's
a bigger purpose out there.

1:16:48.569 --> 1:16:50.744
You're not sure what you're
supposed to achieve and why,

1:16:50.778 --> 1:16:54.368
but you multiply,
and fight to survive just,

1:16:54.402 --> 1:16:56.266
just like cells do.

1:16:57.682 --> 1:16:59.960
And in the end,

1:16:59.994 --> 1:17:03.653
after all those cells
have died,

1:17:03.688 --> 1:17:06.276
this God will die too.

1:17:06.311 --> 1:17:10.004
But even,
even he is only a small part

1:17:10.039 --> 1:17:11.488
of another bigger God

1:17:11.523 --> 1:17:13.767
that controls
more than this planet.

1:17:16.873 --> 1:17:18.564
Look out there, Adam.

1:17:20.394 --> 1:17:22.776
Look out there and see
how many stars are in the sky.

1:17:22.810 --> 1:17:25.399

1:18:00.054 --> 1:18:02.678
I was instantly
connected to knowledge.

1:18:02.712 --> 1:18:06.440
And I learned about
this chemical reaction

1:18:06.474 --> 1:18:07.855
that needs to happen
for you to feel

1:18:07.890 --> 1:18:10.686
