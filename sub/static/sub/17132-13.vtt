WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:05.073
**

00:10.144 --> 00:12.413
(laughs) ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT THE CHORDS.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.415
NOW LET'S JUST WORK
ON THE MOVES, ALL RIGHT?
OKAY.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.417
JUST LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL,
MAN, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.287
ALL RIGHT, WHAT-TCHA, WHAT-TCHA,
WHAT-TCHA. STRUT, STRUT.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.959
LIZARD, LIZARD,
LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.029
POSE. WHAT-TCHA.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.734
NAH, NAH, GEORGE, YOU'RE
REMEMBERING IT ALL WRONG, MAN.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.937
FIRST, IT'S LIZARD, LIZARD
UP HERE ON THE NECK LIKE THAT.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.739
(babbles)

00:38.739 --> 00:41.575
THEN IT'S STRUT, STRUT
LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.078
YOU HAVE TO USE
THE NECK LIKE THAT.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.880
THEN SPLIT.
WOW, ROCK 'N' ROLL!

00:46.880 --> 00:51.452
OH. SEE? LIKE THAT.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.454
THAT'S WHY WE DID
THE POSE, MAN.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.123
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD BE COOL?

00:55.123 --> 00:56.657
IS AT THE END,
WE DID A LITTLE KICK

00:56.657 --> 00:59.059
LIKE DAVID LEE ROTH,
LIKE THAT. AY, BUEY!

01:01.862 --> 01:03.797
OW, LET'S TAKE FIVE.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.635
HEY, WE STILL GOT IT.

01:07.635 --> 01:11.305
YEAH, DAMN STRAIGHT.
HEY, PULL MY LEG. IT'S BURNING.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.477
GUITARS AND ICE PACKS.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.580
YOU GUYS ARE GETTING
THE BAND BACK TOGETHER.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.583
I'LL CALL EVERYONE
WHO USED TO WATCH YOU PLAY.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.486
OH, WAIT.
I'M ALREADY HERE.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.488
OKAY, WE DON'T
NEED YOU TONIGHT,

01:27.488 --> 01:29.557
'CAUSE OUR OLD DRUMMER
JOHNNY VAMOS HAS A BAND,

01:29.557 --> 01:31.325
AND TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA
JAM WITH THEM AT...

01:31.325 --> 01:33.661
THE VIPER ROOM!
THE VIPER ROOM!

01:33.661 --> 01:38.566
(George and Ernie
humming loudly)

01:38.566 --> 01:40.301
* AH

01:41.769 --> 01:45.373
I DON'T REMEMBER A JOHNNY VAMOS
IN "DOS BADASSES."

01:45.373 --> 01:48.276
BEFORE I MET YOU,
IT WAS "TRES BADASSES."

01:48.276 --> 01:51.545
BUT JOHNNY AND I HAD
CREATIVE DIFFERENCES.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.582
I WAS CREATIVE, AND Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
HE WAS DIFFERENT.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.917
THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED HIM
JOHNNY VAMOS,

01:56.917 --> 02:01.289
'CAUSE IT'D BE LIKE THAT--
"JOHNNY, VAMOS."

02:02.590 --> 02:04.725
YEAH, JOHNNY'S DOING
PRETTY GOOD, THOUGH.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.428
HE'S MAKING A LIVING
OUT OF PLAYING MUSIC.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.298
YEAH, I WISH
I HAD HIS LIFE.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.234
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED MY LIFE.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.769
NO, I REALLY WANTED
HIS LIFE.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.306
I JUST SETTLED
FOR WANTING YOURS.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.574
WELL, YOU WON'T BE
SAYING THAT AFTER TONIGHT.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.277
BECAUSE WHEN JOHNNY
BRINGS US UP TO JAM,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.713
I'M GONNA ROCK HIM
OFF THE STAGE.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.748
I'M GONNA BE LIKE...
(hums loudly)

02:27.748 --> 02:29.983
THEN I'M GONNA BE SLOW
LIKE THAT, LIKE THAT--

02:29.983 --> 02:32.686
TENDER, LIKE THAT...
AND A TEAR'S GONNA FALL,

02:32.686 --> 02:34.922
THEN I'M GONNA
PICK IT BACK UP LIKE THAT.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.725
(hums loudly)
THEN I'M GONNA POSE LIKE THAT.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.228
I WANNA SEE YOU GUYS PLAY.
CAN I COME?

02:40.228 --> 02:41.695
YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT?
REALLY?

02:41.695 --> 02:44.698
YEAH, IN SEVEN YEARS
WHEN YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH. HA!

02:44.698 --> 02:47.000
YOU KNOW, I JUST HOPE
WHEN I'M YOUR AGE,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.304
I'M NOT STILL TRYING TO ACT
LIKE I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.306
HEY, WHEN YOU'RE MY AGE,

02:52.306 --> 02:55.343
YOU'LL STILL BE
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

02:55.343 --> 02:57.177
BUT YOU WON'T
BE LIVING HERE,

02:57.177 --> 02:59.680
BECAUSE Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
WHEN YOU'RE 18, YOU'RE OUT,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.916
AND THAT'S THIS MANY,
RIGHT HERE, LIKE THAT.

03:02.916 --> 03:06.053
WILL YOU STOP MAKING JOKES ABOUT
KICKING HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE?

03:06.053 --> 03:07.721
THEY HURT HIS FEELINGS.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.591
NO, THEY DON'T, ANGIE.
HE'S A LOPEZ. HE'S LIKE ME.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.794
HE'S TOUGH.
NOTHING BOTHERS HIM.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.895
REALLY?

03:14.895 --> 03:17.598
SO I GUESS
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU

03:17.598 --> 03:20.100
THAT THE DRUMMER
FROM YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BAND

03:20.100 --> 03:21.802
IS NOW
A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN

03:21.802 --> 03:24.004
DOING WHAT
YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.340
OOH.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.141
WELL, IF IT DOESN'T
BOTHER YOU

03:28.141 --> 03:30.611
THAT SOME OF YOUR CHEERLEADER
FRIENDS FROM HIGH SCHOOL

03:30.611 --> 03:33.347
MARRIED RICH DOCTORS WHO LIKE
TO COMMUNICATE AND CUDDLE.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.349
IN YOUR FACE!

03:35.349 --> 03:37.351
* IN YOUR FACE,
THEY GOT IT IN YOUR FACE *

03:37.351 --> 03:38.586
(both) * THEY GOT IT
IN YOUR FACE *

03:38.586 --> 03:40.554
* THEY GOT IT IN YOUR FACE

03:40.554 --> 03:43.056
* YOU MARRIED A FACTORY WORKER,
HE DOESN'T MAKE ANY MONEY *

03:43.056 --> 03:47.395
* HE'S GOT A REAL BIG HEAD,
HE'S GOT AN ALKIE MOM *

03:57.371 --> 03:59.773
HOW WAS THE SHOW?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.075
TERRIBLE.
JOHNNY TOTALLY BLEW US OFF.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.278
MAYBE HE DIDN'T SEE YOU.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.054
YOU DON'T THINK
HE WOULD NOTICE THAT?

04:14.054 --> 04:16.757
YEAH, HE SAW ME.
HE POINTED HIS MIKE AT ME

04:16.757 --> 04:18.859
SO THAT I COULD SING
WITH HIM.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.661
Ã³RALE, AXEL GROSS.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.531
HE WASN'T
POINTING IT AT YOU, MAN,

04:23.531 --> 04:26.400
HE WAS SWINGING IT AT YOUR HEAD
FROM THE BOTTOM.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.937
(discordant chords
playing on guitar)

04:29.937 --> 04:31.972
MY GUITAR!

04:31.972 --> 04:33.741
MAX!

04:33.741 --> 04:36.043
THE STRAP FELL OFF. I JUST
WANTED TO PLAY IT A LITTLE.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.245
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TOUCH MY GUITAR.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.780
NOW THERE'S A SCRATCH ON IT.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.650
GEORGE, CALM DOWN. IT'S NOT EVEN
AN EXPENSIVE GUITAR.

04:42.650 --> 04:46.520
ANGIE, ARE YOU CRAZY?
THIS IS A VINTAGE LES PAUL.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.756
IT'S A LOS PALO.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.025
YOU GOT IT
AT THE SWAP MEET.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.728
YEAH, WELL, IT'S STILL
A COLLECTOR'S ITEM.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.631
ONLY A HUNDRED WERE MADE
BEFORE THEY RAIDED THE FACTORY

04:57.631 --> 04:59.333
AND FREED THE CHILDREN.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.134
STAY AWAY FROM MY STUFF,

05:01.134 --> 05:04.505
AND REMEMBER, EVERYTHING
IN THIS HOUSE IS MY STUFF.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.507
MOM!
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
DON'T TALK TO HER.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.841
SHE'S MY STUFF, TOO.

05:07.841 --> 05:08.876
GEORGE.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.078
YOU WANNA BE DROPPED
AND SCRATCHED?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.245
I'M PROTECTING YOU.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.947
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:13.947 --> 05:16.950
I'LL JUST GO UP TO MY ROOM
AND STAY IN THERE TILL I'M 18.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.652
THEN I'LL MOVE OUT,

05:18.652 --> 05:21.555
AND YOU'LL GET
WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.024
DO YOU HEAR THAT? NOW DO YOU
BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU JOKE

05:24.024 --> 05:26.894
ABOUT KICKING HIM OUT OF
THE HOUSE HE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY?

05:26.894 --> 05:30.564
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT MAX. HE DROPPED SALMA.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.603
DADDY'S HERE.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.905
GEORGE, YOU CAN'T
KEEP PUSHING HIM AWAY.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.874
HE'LL BE OUT OF THE HOUSE
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.876
AND YOU'RE
GONNA MISS HIM.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.779
ANGIE, I'M NOT
ALL SENTIMENTAL LIKE YOU.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.881
REALLY? REMEMBER
WHEN HE WAS A BABY

05:47.881 --> 05:50.784
AND HIS FIRST WORD
WAS "DA-DA"?

05:50.784 --> 05:53.053
OH, NO. I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

05:53.053 --> 05:54.522
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.858
HOW ABOUT WHEN HE WAS 4 AND HE
WOULD TAKE A NAP ON YOUR CHEST

05:57.858 --> 06:00.494
WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING
THE RAIDERS GAME?

06:00.494 --> 06:06.266
THEY NEVER LOST
WHILE HE WAS ON ME.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.702
THEN THERE WAS THAT HALLOWEEN
WHEN HE WAS 8.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.038
WE ASKED WHAT SUPERHERO
HE WANTED TO BE,

06:11.038 --> 06:13.040
AND HE SAID, "MY DAD."

06:13.040 --> 06:17.578
I MISS HIM ALREADY!

06:17.578 --> 06:20.180
WHY'D HE GO AWAY?

06:20.180 --> 06:24.084
HE'S UPSTAIRS WONDERING
WHERE HIS DAD WENT.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.653
(sniffles)
YOU KNOW,
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU

06:25.653 --> 06:27.655
TO BE MORE CAREFUL
WITH MAX'S FEELINGS.

06:27.655 --> 06:30.691
ACTUALLY, YOU COULD BE
MORE SENSITIVE WITH EVERYONE.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.560
OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.027
I'M GONNA BE MORE SENSITIVE.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.464
STARTING NOW, I'M GONNA BE
SENSITIVE. WHAT-TCHA.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.265
I CAN CHANGE LIKE THAT.
LOOKIT.

06:38.265 --> 06:41.702
INSENSITIVE--SENSITIVE.
EVEN THE SNAPS WERE DIFFERENT.
OH.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.037
HEY,
I'M OUTTA HERE, MAN.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.708
I BENT OVER TO PICK UP
A PRETZEL OFF THE FLOOR,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.710
AND MY PANTS SPLIT OPEN.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.012
YEAH, WELL IF YOUR PANTS
START RIPPING OPEN,

06:52.012 --> 06:55.415
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START EATING
VEGETABLES OFF THE FLOOR.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.984
I'M SORRY.

06:56.984 --> 07:01.455
I DIDN'T REALIZE I STILL HAD
ONE LEFT IN THE CHAMBER.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.194
MAN,
ARE YOU WEARING A THONG?

07:07.194 --> 07:11.164
I DIDN'T WANT CREASE LINES
IN THE LEATHER.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.601
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? MAN,
I'M TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.603
AND YOU'RE WEARING A THONG.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.606
PUT IT IN REVERSE
AND BACK THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.374
I DON'T WANNA SEE
YOUR BACKSTREET BOYS.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.077
OH, UH, MY KEYS.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.718
THAT REMINDS ME--
I HAVE A HAM TO DEFROST.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.558
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:40.828 --> 07:42.696
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:42.696 --> 07:46.466
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:48.068 --> 07:51.404
* THE LOW RIDER

07:51.404 --> 07:53.006
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

08:07.621 --> 08:10.290
MAX, BUDDY! (chuckles)

08:10.290 --> 08:12.059
I GOT YOU A SURPRISE.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.527
FOR WHAT?

08:13.527 --> 08:16.063
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
DOING A LOT BETTER IN SCHOOL.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.498
I JUST GOT A "D"
ON MY GEOMETRY TEST.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.433
I NEED YOU TO SIGN IT.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.769
OKAY, UH...

08:21.769 --> 08:24.437
YOU WENT TO THE DENTIST.
NO CAVITIES, RIGHT?

08:24.437 --> 08:26.473
THREE.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.742
DID YOU TIE YOUR OWN SHOES?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.911
THEY'RE SLIP-ONS.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.147
OKAY, GOOD JOB PICKING OUT
SHOES YOU CAN HANDLE.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.817
I GOT YOU A GUITAR.
NO WAY! OH, AWESOME!

08:36.817 --> 08:38.786
AND I GOT YOU AN AMP, TOO,

08:38.786 --> 08:41.221
AND I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.957
PUT YOUR FINGER LIKE THAT,
AND YOU'LL BE LIKE THAT.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.427
YOU'LL BE LIKE THAT,
YOU'LL BE LIKE THAT.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.229
(plays chord)

08:49.229 --> 08:50.664
SWEET!

08:50.664 --> 08:54.902
OH, THIS'LL BE FUN!
WE CAN ALL PLAY TOGETHER.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.604
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

08:56.604 --> 08:59.873
DADDY USED TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS
OVER TO PRACTICE THE CONGAS,

08:59.873 --> 09:02.075
AND I PLAYED
A MEAN TAMBOURINE.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.877
I CAN ALSO SING.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.614
* CHIRRI BOOM, CHIRRI BOOM,
TAMBORINA *

09:06.614 --> 09:08.849
* CHIRRI BOOM, CHIRRI BOOM,
TAMBORINA *

09:08.849 --> 09:10.651
* CHIRRI BOOM, CHIRRI BOOM,
TAMBORINA *

09:10.651 --> 09:12.820
* CHIRRI BOOM, CHIRRI BOOM--

09:12.820 --> 09:16.724
(plays loudly)

09:16.724 --> 09:18.191
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF SING.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.294
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT I CAN.
CRANK IT UP, MAX!

09:21.294 --> 09:24.197
(resumes playing loudly)

09:27.935 --> 09:30.738
(guitar playing loudly)

09:30.738 --> 09:33.306
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

09:33.306 --> 09:35.342
IT'S MAX. I BOUGHT HIM
A GUITAR LAST WEEK.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.511
JEEZ. JUST HEARING THAT NOISE
BRINGS BACK THE HEADACHES

09:38.511 --> 09:41.214
FROM WHEN
YOU USED TO PLAY.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.751
YOU WOKE UP EVERY MORNING
ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR

09:43.751 --> 09:46.820
SWEATING TEQUILA
AND HUGGING THE TOILET.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.857
THOSE HEADACHES
DIDN'T COME FROM MY GUITAR.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.594
(chords playing loudly
on guitar)

09:54.594 --> 09:56.029
WOW.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.732
HE'S ALREADY BETTER
THAN YOU EVER WERE.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.033
I TAUGHT HIM THAT.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.835
I'M ACTUALLY SPENDING TIME
WITH MY SON

10:01.835 --> 10:03.704
DOING SOMETHING
WE BOTH ENJOY.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.807
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.
CUT THE CRAP, GEORGE.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.942
I PLAYED WITH YOU
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE KID.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.611
OH, YEAH.
THOSE WERE FUN GAMES, MOM.

10:11.611 --> 10:16.149
"SHOTS AND LADDERS"?

10:16.149 --> 10:19.086
"BRANDY-LAND"?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.554
AND MY FAVORITE--
YOUR VERSION OF "CLUE"--

10:21.554 --> 10:25.959
IT'S "COLONEL MUSTARD"
IN THE BEDROOM WITH MY MOM.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.863
(guitar chords playing loudly)

10:29.863 --> 10:32.365
THOSE ARE THE CHORDS
WE WERE WORKING ON LAST NIGHT.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.767
WE WERE LIKE THAT.

10:33.767 --> 10:38.772
(band playing)

10:38.772 --> 10:41.641
WHAT'S THAT?

10:47.815 --> 10:50.818
HEY, DAD, THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
FROM SCHOOL.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.452
THEY ASKED ME
TO JOIN THEIR BAND.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.022
THAT'S AWESOME, DUDE!
YOU'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING A WEEK.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.124
THEY SAID I COULD LEARN
WHILE WE PRACTICE.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.759
THERE'S A BATTLE OF THE BANDS
COMING UP.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.861
HEY, BACK IN THE DAY,
I WAS IN ONE OF THOSE.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.030
AFTER OUR SONG,
WE SET OUR INSTRUMENTS ON FIRE.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.265
THE CROWD WENT WILD.
WE WON THE FIRST ROUND.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.900
WHAT ABOUT
THE SECOND ROUND?

11:06.900 --> 11:10.971
WHAT SECOND ROUND?
WE SET OUR INSTRUMENTS ON FIRE.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.942
WE'RE THE REASON THE CURTAINS
IN YOUR AUDITORIUM

11:14.942 --> 11:17.377
ARE FLAME-RETARDANT.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.180
DUDE, MAX, WE GOTTA PRACTICE.
YEAH, HEY, BEFORE YOU GUYS
GET STARTED,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.682
WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU
A TRICK OR TWO?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.418
UM, NICKY'S REALLY GOOD, DAD.
I DON'T THINK WE NEED ANY HELP.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.621
MAX, Â¿SABESQUÃ©? I WAS PLAYING
GUITAR BEFORE NICKY WAS BORN.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.757
WHAT-TCHA.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.860
(playing simple melody)

11:34.327 --> 11:38.732
(distorts chord)

11:38.732 --> 11:41.869
(playing complex riff)

11:47.808 --> 11:52.612
YEAH, TECHNICALLY OKAY,
BUT NO EMOTION.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.749
(playing blues-style riff)

12:04.224 --> 12:08.762
NOPE.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.764
DAD, WE REALLY
HAVE TO PRACTICE.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.400
YEAH, OKAY, SURE.
WE'LL JAM LATER.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.005
THAT'S AWESOME, NICKY.
YOU'VE GOTTA TEACH ME THAT.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.008
HEY, WHEN HE CAN PLAY THAT
WITH A FLAMING CURTAIN

12:21.008 --> 12:25.078
FALLING DOWN ON HIS HEAD,
THEN I'LL BE IMPRESSED.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.080
SHOW-OFF.
YEAH, HOW ABOUT YOU?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.350
(makes squeaking sound)

12:30.350 --> 12:34.121
YOU HAVE HAD 25 YEARS TO LEARN
HOW TO BE A COOL TEENAGER,

12:34.121 --> 12:37.257
AND YOU STILL CAN'T DO IT.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.459
THAT NICKY KID
MAY KNOW SOME FLASHY TRICKS,

12:39.459 --> 12:41.929
BUT MAX AND I
ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME,

12:41.929 --> 12:44.697
AND I'M GONNA BE THE ONE
TO TEACH HIM

12:44.697 --> 12:46.066
HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.568
HEY, DAD, I DIDN'T
WANNA SAY IT IN THERE,

12:48.568 --> 12:51.271
BUT NICKY THINKS I SHOULD
ONLY JAM WITH HIM NOW

12:51.271 --> 12:53.773
BECAUSE THEN I WON'T
PICK UP ANY SLOPPY HABITS.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.109
YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

12:56.109 --> 13:00.247
YEAH, OF COURSE,
THAT'S--THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.083
UH, YOU GO BACK IN THERE, MAN,
AND YOU ROCK WITH NICKY.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.452
HEY, I'M TOTALLY COOL
WITH THAT.
ALL RIGHT.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.955
HUH? I'M COOL. (laughs)

13:10.858 --> 13:13.326
I USED TO BE A SUPERHERO.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.632
TESTING, ONE, TWO.
CHECK, CHECK.

13:19.632 --> 13:24.471
AT THE END OF THE MEAL,
YOU PAY THE CHECK, CHECK.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.974
YOU GOT A MONSTER
UNDER YOUR BED?

13:26.974 --> 13:29.742
YOU BETTER CHECK, CHECK.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.012
IF YOU FIND A LUMP
ON YOUR HUEVOS,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.614
YOU BETTER CHECK, CHECK.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.150
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.687
I'M TESTING THE P.A. SYSTEM
I GOT FOR MAX AND THE BAND.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.189
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET

13:42.189 --> 13:44.457
THAT MAX DIDN'T WANT
TO PLAY GUITAR WITH YOU,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.826
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM
SOME SPACE, HUH?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
NOW YOU WANT ME
TO BACK OFF?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.830
YOU TOLD ME
TO GET MORE INVOLVED.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.665
MAKE UP YOUR MIND, WOMAN.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.503
YOU CAN'T PLAY THE PIANO
WITH BOTH HANDS AT ONCE.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.673
THAT IS HOW
YOU PLAY THE PIANO.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.475
NOT IN ROCK 'N' ROLL.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.711
YOU PLAY WITH ONE HAND,
AND WITH THE OTHER HAND

14:04.711 --> 14:08.381
YOU POINT OUT WHICH GROUPIES
YOU WANT TO COME BACKSTAGE.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.784
NO, NO, NO--THAT'S A DUDE--
YES, HELLO.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.086
I'M FLATTERED,

14:13.086 --> 14:15.588
AND IT'S GREAT
YOU GOT MAX A GUITAR,

14:15.588 --> 14:17.790
BUT NOW HE'S IN A BAND.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.292
HE'S GOT FRIENDS.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.229
I THINK YOU SHOULD LET HIM
COME TO YOU NOW.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.231
LISTEN,
THIS IS THE FIRST THING

14:24.231 --> 14:26.199
THAT WE'VE EVER ENJOYED
DOING TOGETHER.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.235
I'M NOT JUST GONNA LET IT GO.
(Max) WHAT'S THIS?

14:28.235 --> 14:32.505
I GOT YOU GUYS THE ONE THING
YOU DON'T HAVE--A P.A. SYSTEM!
OH, NO WAY!

14:32.505 --> 14:35.508
AWESOME.
OF COURSE, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOMEBODY TO RUN THE BOARD,

14:35.508 --> 14:38.511
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY WHO
UNDERSTANDS HIGH END, FEEDBACK,

14:38.511 --> 14:41.681
TAMBIÃ©N REVERBS--
NOUNS LIKE THAT.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.351
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN BE
OUR SOUND GUY, DAD.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.454
YES! OKAY, ANGIE,
Â¿SABES QUÃ©? YOU GOTTA GO.

14:47.454 --> 14:51.324
THE BAND AND I GOT A LOT
TO COVER, TAMBIÃ©N.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.393
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
RUN THROUGH

14:53.393 --> 14:56.696
YOUR BATTLE OF THE BANDS SET,
AND I'LL CHECK YOUR LEVELS?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.198
(Nicky) ALL RIGHT.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.200
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.569
(playing slow blues-style music)

15:07.674 --> 15:09.376
STOP! STOP, STOP!

15:09.376 --> 15:12.579
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY GIRLS
TO THROW THEIR PANTIES ON STAGE

15:12.579 --> 15:14.781
PLAYING THAT SONG.
THEY'RE GONNA HEAR THAT SONG,

15:14.781 --> 15:17.817
AND THEY'RE GONNA THINK YOU'RE
ALREADY WEARING GIRLS' PANTIES.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.552
LIKE THAT...
DAD, WE LIKE THIS SONG.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.423
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS?
YOU'RE LUCKY I'M HERE, OKAY?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.793
LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING.
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE BAND?

15:26.793 --> 15:28.261
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.498
OH, QUELA,
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE!

15:31.498 --> 15:35.135
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST
CALL YOURSELVES "THE LOSERS"?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.436
ACTUALLY, THAT MIGHT WORK--

15:36.436 --> 15:39.472
REPLACE THE "S"
WITH A BACKWARD "Z."

15:39.472 --> 15:42.042
ISN'T A BACKWARD "Z"
JUST AN "S"?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.677
ISN'T A "Z"
JUST AN "N" ON ITS SIDE?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.613
WE CAN DO THIS ALL DAY.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.050
OH, Ã³RALE.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.586
Ã³RALE, ROMPER ROOM.
WHAT'S THIS?

15:53.586 --> 15:56.423
THIS IS LAURA, ANNIE,
MARNIE AND JACKIE.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.890
THEY CAME
TO WATCH US PRACTICE.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.193
NO, Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
NO CHICKS.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.529
JUST US, THE CORE GUYS.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.698
DAD, GRANDMA BENNY JUST CAME OUT
OF THE HOUSE IN A BIKINI.

16:05.698 --> 16:10.003
DAMN IT! WHO TOLD HER THERE WERE
HIGH SCHOOL BOYS HERE?

16:10.003 --> 16:12.172
SHE'S NOT OUT HERE.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.108
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?
"NO CHICKS"?

16:15.108 --> 16:17.344
TRUST ME, CHICKS RUIN BANDS.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.646
ONE MINUTE THEY'RE HAPPY
TO HEAR YOU PLAY,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.648
THE NEXT MINUTE
THEY'RE CHANGING EVERYTHING.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.351
TELLING YOU WHAT TO WEAR, WHAT
TO PLAY, BOSSING YOU AROUND.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.319
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, DAD.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
YOU'RE THE CHICK
RUINING OUR BAND.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.058
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER, MAN.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.759
YOU NEED ME.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.862
NO, WE DON'T NEED YOU. WE JUST
NEED A PLACE TO PRACTICE,

16:35.862 --> 16:40.133
BUT YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME,
SO WE'LL FIND SOMEPLACE ELSE.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.038
THAT'S GOT YOU.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.440
THEN I'M KEEPING
THE FOG MACHINE,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.442
AND I'M TAKING BACK
THE BAND'S NAME.

16:49.442 --> 16:53.180
THAT'S RIGHT--
I'M THE ONLY "LOSER" HERE.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.648
IT'S A BACKWARDS--SEE,
YOU DON'T GET IT. IT'S COOL.

16:55.648 --> 16:59.586
OH, WE GET IT.
YOU'RE A LOSER.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.588
WHO ARE YOUR PARENTS?

17:01.588 --> 17:04.724
BECAUSE, Â¿SABESQUÃ©?
THEY DIDN'T RAISE YOU RIGHT.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.131
(strumming slow melody)

17:16.403 --> 17:18.871
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE SMOKE?

17:18.871 --> 17:22.342
DID A LITTLE GIRL FROM KANSAS
THROW WATER ON YOUR MOTHER?

17:25.312 --> 17:30.517
NO, IT'S A FOG MACHINE
I GOT FOR MAX AND THE BAND.

17:30.517 --> 17:34.254
YEAH, ANGIE TOLD ME YOU WERE
TEACHING HIM TO PLAY GUITAR, NO?

17:34.254 --> 17:35.955
WHEN MY SON WAS 13,

17:35.955 --> 17:39.592
I BOUGHT HIM A CAMERA,
AND WE TOOK A PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS.

17:39.592 --> 17:44.897
TWO WEEKS LATER, HE WAS SELLING
NAKED PICTURES OF OUR MAID.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.534
WELL, IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
FOR ME AND MAX, EITHER.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.569
AS SOON AS HE GOT IN THAT BAND,
HE DROPPED ME.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.639
WELL, MAX IS
AT A DIFFICULT AGE, YOU KNOW,

17:52.639 --> 17:57.144
BUT HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU,
AND HE WANTS TO BE HIS OWN MAN.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.846
IT'S THE PUSH-PULL
OF A TEENAGER.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.648
WELL, I REACHED OUT TO HIM,

18:01.648 --> 18:03.516
AND ALL I GOT
WAS A HANDFUL OF REJECTION.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.518
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT REALLY SUCKS, VIC?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.520
THAT'S A GREAT TITLE
FOR A SONG,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.657
AND I GOT NOBODY
TO SHARE IT WITH.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.926
WELL, GEORGE,
IF IT CHEERS YOU UP,

18:13.926 --> 18:18.131
"HANDFUL OF REJECTION" SOUNDS
MORE LIKE A TRANCE-TECHNO THING,

18:18.131 --> 18:21.234
AND THAT'S NOT YOUR BAG,
DADDY.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.403
GEORGE, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MAX.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.206
DON'T WORRY.
I'M GONNA GIVE HIM HIS SPACE.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.241
THE GUYS KICKED HIM
OUT OF THE BAND.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.410
WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, THEY ONLY WANTED HIM

18:30.410 --> 18:33.079
SO THEY COULD HAVE
A PLACE TO PRACTICE.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.348
HE REALLY NEEDS YOU
RIGHT NOW.

18:35.348 --> 18:38.351
LOOK, I TRIED TO BOND WITH HIM,
AND HE PUSHED ME AWAY.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.353
WHAT, SO NOW
HE GOT HIS FEELINGS HURT,

18:40.353 --> 18:42.822
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
GO RUNNING TO HIM?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.057
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS FATHER

18:45.057 --> 18:50.197
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO LOVE HIM UNCONDITIONALLY.
NO, YOU SEE, I'M A LOPEZ.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.131
I GOT
ALL KINDS OF CONDITIONS.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.933
I NEED RESPECT AND SUPPORT,

18:53.933 --> 18:58.070
AND IF WE GET IN A FIGHT, I NEED
YOU TO SAY "I'M SORRY" FIRST.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.473
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.476
AND I'M NOT INTO PEOPLE
WHO ARE ALL INTO FAIRNESS.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.913
NOW SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

19:06.913 --> 19:10.250
(guitar playing discordantly)

19:10.250 --> 19:12.185
GEORGE.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.086
NO, ANGIE,
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.557
(guitar resumes playing)

19:17.557 --> 19:19.826
SERIOUSLY, NO,
HE'S ON HIS OWN.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.095
(guitar continues
playing discordantly)

19:23.095 --> 19:25.832
DAMN IT, BOY,
GET YOUR PINKIE DOWN!

19:25.832 --> 19:29.168
OH, QUE LA.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.872
COME ON, MAN,

19:32.872 --> 19:36.108
YOU GOTTA GET
THAT PINKIE DOWN.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.778
(plays harmonious chord)

19:38.778 --> 19:41.281
THANKS.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.217
HEY, GOOD MOVE
QUITTING THE BAND.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.719
I DIDN'T QUIT.
THEY KICKED ME OUT.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.657
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S NOT
THE STORY YOU TELL AT SCHOOL.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.660
YOU HAD ARTISTIC DIFFERENCES,

19:53.660 --> 19:57.196
AND YOU LEFT THE BAND
TO PURSUE A SOLO CAREER.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.733
I SUCK AT GUITAR.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.736
NO, YOU DON'T. HEY,
YOU'RE WAY AHEAD OF WHERE I WAS

20:03.736 --> 20:07.039
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.
YOU'LL GET ANOTHER BAND.
YOU THINK SO?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.975
HELL, YEAH! YOU GOT
A NEW GUITAR, A P.A. SYSTEM

20:08.975 --> 20:12.845
AND SOMEONE WHO WILL JAM
WITH YOU WHENEVER YOU WANT.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.781
SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.319
IT'S OKAY, MAX.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:21.254 --> 20:24.257
YOU'RE MY SON.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.860
WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS TOGETHER.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.931
THAT'S IT?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.766
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA PLAY TOGETHER.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.235
WE ARE. I'M-A GET
THE FOG MACHINE, VATO.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.271
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.906
WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT.

20:39.906 --> 20:44.744
IF YOU SEE YOUR MOM COMING WITH
A TAMBOURINE, LOCK THIS DOOR.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.347
I'LL COME IN
THROUGH THAT WINDOW. CIAO!

20:47.347 --> 20:52.218
(playing up-tempo rock)

20:52.218 --> 20:54.887
STRUT, STRUT, STRUT, STRUT.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.024
**

21:13.506 --> 21:15.908
ONE, TWO, TRES, NINE.

21:15.908 --> 21:26.919
**
