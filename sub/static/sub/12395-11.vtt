00:10.040 --> 00:11.530

00:15.310 --> 00:17.175
- UH, SHAWN,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:17.210 --> 00:18.177
- GUS...

00:18.210 --> 00:19.643
BUDDY...

00:22.320 --> 00:24.447
YOU REMEMBER WHEN I SPENT
ALL THAT DOUGH

00:24.490 --> 00:26.151
ON THE WEEKEND RETREAT
WITH JULES?

00:26.190 --> 00:27.714
- IT WAS MY DOUGH.
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.251
- [whispering]
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.221
LOOK, DUDE, WE DON'T HAVE
A CASE--NO CASE, NO MONEY.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.433
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO RAISE
A LITTLE CASH TO PAY YOU BACK.

00:39.470 --> 00:41.267
I'VE ALREADY MADE 50 BUCKS.
[high-pitched squeal]

00:41.300 --> 00:43.700
- [clears throat]

00:43.740 --> 00:45.298
- [normal voice] HEY, THURMAN.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING, KID?

00:45.340 --> 00:46.602
- IS THIS A JOKE?

00:46.640 --> 00:48.369
- NO, IT'S NOT A JOKE.

00:48.410 --> 00:52.676
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
BUY SOMETHING ELSE.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.846
- [whispering]
LISTEN, SHAWN,

00:53.880 --> 00:55.347
IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO RAISE SOME CASH,

00:55.380 --> 00:57.109
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SELL
THE ENGAGEMENT RING

00:57.150 --> 00:58.287
YOU DIDN'T GIVE TO JULIET?

00:58.320 --> 01:00.151
- [whispering]
ARE YOU CRAZY? HOW DARE YOU?

01:00.190 --> 01:01.316
- WHAT?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.429
- THAT IS
MY GRANDMA-GAMMA'S RING.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.382
IT IS A PRIZED
SPENCER FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

01:04.430 --> 01:06.352
- WHICH YOU STASHED
IN A NINTENDO D.S.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.797
- WHICH WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN,

01:08.830 --> 01:10.297
BECAUSE NOW IT'S
IN THE MOST SECURE PLACE EVER.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.332
- WHERE,
A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX?

01:12.370 --> 01:14.463
- EVEN BETTER...
A THUNDERCAT.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.468
- WHAT?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.205
- SPEAKING OF WHICH--

01:18.240 --> 01:19.639
- WHERE IS THAT THING?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.432
- THUNDERCATS, HO!

01:21.480 --> 01:22.447

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

01:22.480 --> 01:24.345
THAT IS NOT FOR SALE.

01:24.380 --> 01:25.347
SORRY.
SORRY, THURMAN.

01:25.380 --> 01:26.677
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO HAND THAT OVER.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.779
- HE DID PAY FULL PRICE
FOR IT, SHAWN.

01:28.820 --> 01:30.549
- WELL, I'M GOING
TO BUY IT BACK, JULES.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.353
- PRICE JUST WENT UP,
KINGFISHER.

01:32.390 --> 01:33.459
- KINGFISHER?

01:33.490 --> 01:36.721
THURMAN, I WILL GIVE YOU $15

01:39.900 --> 01:42.323
GIVE ME THE--

THIS IS $57.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.517
WELL, I THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO FOLLOW ME NO MATTER WHAT.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.154
OKAY, GOOD-BYE.

02:17.570 --> 02:18.867
- SO?

02:18.900 --> 02:20.231
- NOTHING SUSPICIOUS.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.237
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO ROGUE

02:21.270 --> 02:23.238
AND FABRICATE SOMETHING
TO GET US IN ON THIS.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.168
- HOW IS THAT
DIFFERENT FROM USUAL?

02:24.210 --> 02:26.405
- I'M COMPLETELY SOBER.
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.873
- I COULD EAT.
- ME TOO.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.844
- ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.714
DECEASED'S NAME
IS MARC WARAFI'IG, AGE 35.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.672
KEPT A TIDY LIVING SPACE.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.415
I RESPECT THAT.

02:37.450 --> 02:38.382
- HIS BODY WAS FOUND

02:38.420 --> 02:41.309
BY THE BUILDING MANAGER,
A MR. LLOYD MARR.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.452
- I'M HERE.

02:42.490 --> 02:43.627
- OH, UH, RIGHT.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.197
WELL, WE WILL, UH--WE WILL CALL
YOU IF WE NEED ANYTHING.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.219
- DON'T HAVE A CELL PHONE.

02:47.260 --> 02:49.228
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE HAVE
THE BUILDING NUMBER,

02:49.270 --> 02:50.726
AND, UH, YOU LIVE HERE.

02:56.470 --> 02:58.358
- WELL, JULES,
MY VISION HAS TOLD ME

02:58.410 --> 03:01.299
THAT THE HANGING DUDE
HUNG HIMSELF.

03:01.340 --> 03:02.876
SO SHOULD I JUST INVOICE YOU,

03:02.910 --> 03:05.208
OR IS THERE
A CASH MACHINE NEARBY?

03:05.250 --> 03:06.547
- HMM. THAT DOESN'T
REALLY STRIKE ME

03:06.580 --> 03:08.218
AS A BILLABLE OBSERVATION,
SHAWN.

03:08.250 --> 03:09.342
- DAMN IT.
- HMM.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.709
WELL, SHAWN AND I
WILL FIND THE KITCHEN.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.411
THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT OUR HOURLY RATE IS

03:12.460 --> 03:14.712
FOR COMING UP WITH NOTHING.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.455
- HEY, LLOYD?

03:16.490 --> 03:18.856
SAY, UM, TWO BEDROOM,
TWO BATH--

03:18.890 --> 03:20.619
APPROXIMATELY WHAT,
1,600 SQUARE FEET?

03:20.660 --> 03:21.922
- 1,650.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.360
- [stamps foot]

03:24.400 --> 03:27.699
ORIGINAL OAK FLOORS,
SOME LOVELY PERIOD DETAILS.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.537
I WONDER IF IT'S STILL
KNOB AND TUBE.

03:29.570 --> 03:32.539
[toilet flushes]

03:32.580 --> 03:34.377
SOLID PLUMBING.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.401
HEY, SPENCER!
- YO!

03:36.450 --> 03:38.907
- WHAT'S THE APPLIANCE SITUATION
LIKE IN THE KITCHEN?

03:38.950 --> 03:40.508
- 12-CAN DISPENSER
IN THE FRIDGE--

03:40.550 --> 03:41.539
SUPER DOPE!

03:41.580 --> 03:44.413
- BUT HIS SNACKS
ARE DISGUSTING--WAY TOO HEALTHY.

03:44.450 --> 03:45.940
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU ARE NOT SHOPPING

03:45.990 --> 03:47.981
FOR REAL ESTATE RIGHT NOW.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.488
- IN EXACTLY 93 DAYS
AND 94 NIGHTS,

03:50.530 --> 03:52.418
MARLOWE WILL SETTLE UP
HER DEBT TO SOCIETY,

03:52.460 --> 03:54.758
AND I THINK THAT IT'S HIGH TIME
THAT I STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE

03:54.800 --> 03:57.018
AND BOUGHT A HOME FOR MYSELF
AND THE WOMAN I LOVE.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.924
BESIDES, ANYTHING MORE THAN
A COT AND A HOT PLATE

03:58.970 --> 04:01.837
IS GOING TO LOOK
LIKE VERSAILLES TO HER.

04:01.870 --> 04:05.408
WHAT?

04:05.440 --> 04:06.873
I CAN TELL JUST BY GLANCING,
THEY'RE NOT MY SIZE.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.878
- OH, MY GOD.
- LLOYD, MY MAN...

04:08.910 --> 04:10.901
I'M GOING TO NEED
MARC'S NEXT -OF-KIN INFORMATION.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.271
- THAT'D BE, UH,
HIS SISTER, JUNE.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.413
- EXCELLENT.
I WOULD LOVE TO GET A PRICE

04:15.450 --> 04:17.315
ON HER DEAD BROTHER'S
LIVING ROOM SET

04:17.350 --> 04:20.057
BEFORE THE ESTATE-SALE VULTURES
SWOOP IN.

04:20.090 --> 04:23.753
OH, IT'S PLUSH,
STILL QUITE FIRM.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.554
GATHER ROUND, EVERYONE!

04:26.600 --> 04:30.422
THERE IS SOME BIG NEWS THAT YOU
ARE ALL GOING TO WANT TO HEAR!

04:30.470 --> 04:32.438
I HAVE JUST PURCHASED
A NEW CONDO

04:32.470 --> 04:34.438
FOR MYSELF
AND MY GIRLFRIEND, MARLOWE,

04:34.470 --> 04:35.539
WHO WILL BE JOINING ME

04:35.570 --> 04:37.504
UPON COMPLETION
OF HER PRISON TERM.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.802
THERE WAS A COMPETING BID
ON THE PLACE,

04:38.840 --> 04:40.603
BUT I SQUASHED THAT
LIKE A BUG.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.870
YOU ARE LOOKING
AT THE NEWEST RESIDENT

04:42.910 --> 04:44.400
OF PROSPECT GARDENS.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.678

04:45.710 --> 04:48.417
- YES, MCNAB,
THE PROSPECT GARDENS.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.611
TRY AND HIDE YOUR JEALOUSY.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

04:50.650 --> 04:52.379
- I HEARD THAT PLACE
HAS BAD JUJU.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.682
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.779
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.583
- THANK YOU.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.621

05:02.900 --> 05:05.425
WEAR CLOTHING THAT YOU
DON'T MIND GETTING PAINT ON.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.735
AND BACK BRACES ARE RECOMMENDED,
BUT NOT REQUIRED.

05:08.770 --> 05:11.364
OKAY, GET BACK TO WORK,
CRIME FIGHTERS!

05:11.410 --> 05:14.937
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN!
- WOW, LASSIE.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.107
YOU BOUGHT
THE DEAD GUY'S CONDO?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.449
- YOU SEE, SPENCER,
THIS IS WHAT A REAL MAN

05:20.480 --> 05:22.414
IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP DOES.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.940
HE PROVIDES FOR HIS LADY LOVE.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.414
WATCH AND LEARN,
AND MAYBE, AGAINST ALL ODDS,

05:27.460 --> 05:29.382
O'HARA JUST MIGHT STICK AROUND.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.351
PROBABLY NOT.

05:39.100 --> 05:42.604
[knock at door]

05:42.640 --> 05:43.834
[gun cocks]

05:43.870 --> 05:46.873
[knocking continues]

05:49.480 --> 05:51.698
- HIYA.
CARLTON, RIGHT?

05:51.750 --> 05:53.377
AMY, ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.739
QUICK DIRECTIONS
FROM YOU TO ME--

05:54.780 --> 05:57.510
EXIT THIS DOOR, HARD RIGHT,
THREE FLOORS DOWN--

05:57.550 --> 05:58.744
- I KNOW WHERE
YOUR APARTMENT IS.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.588
- OKAY. OOH, WOW, I LOVE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.418
IT'S COZY
BUT WITH A HEAW DOSE OF MAN.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.529
I DIG IT.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.551
SAD ABOUT MARCKY.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.898
HE WAS GOOD PEOPLE.

06:09.930 --> 06:11.420
- CAN I HELP YOU?

06:11.470 --> 06:12.767
- NO.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.439
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
IT'S A POTLUCK BASKET.

06:15.470 --> 06:17.165
I LIKE TO DO IT
FOR ALL THE NEWBIES.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.905
SEE, EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING
GIVES A LITTLE GIFT,

06:18.940 --> 06:20.908
AND THEN I MAKE IT
LOOK ALL "PURTY."

06:20.940 --> 06:23.408
HERE YOU GO.
WELCOME TO PROSPECT GARDENS.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.599
- RAT TRAPS?

06:24.650 --> 06:27.915
- OH, UM, YES, THEY ARE FROM
LLOYD, THE BUILDING MANAGER.

06:27.950 --> 06:29.645
HE'S GOT THEM
ALL OVER THE BUILDING,

06:29.690 --> 06:31.885
JUST IN CASE YOU GET RATS.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.184
[whispering]
THE BATH SALTS ARE FROM ME.

06:34.220 --> 06:37.678
* A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YOU AND YOUR LADY *

06:37.730 --> 06:39.425
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF I HAVE A LADY?

06:39.460 --> 06:40.620
- OH, PLEASE.

06:40.660 --> 06:44.118
AS IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT
COULD STILL BE ON THE MARKET.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.024
RIGHT.
IT'S NOT, RIGHT?

06:46.070 --> 06:47.992
- WELL, UH, LISTEN, JUDY--

06:48.040 --> 06:49.735
- AMY.
- MAYBE YOU CAN SAVE ME

06:49.770 --> 06:51.101
SOME TIME
AND AN ALTERCATION OR TWO.

06:51.140 --> 06:52.573
- MM-HMM.
- I DROPPED MY NEST EGG

06:52.610 --> 06:53.907
ON THIS PLACE,

06:53.940 --> 06:55.168
AND THAT'S YEARS
OF INTERROGATIONS AND ARRESTS.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.905
- ARRESTS?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.599
ARE YOU A MAN IN BLUE?

06:58.650 --> 07:01.141
- I'M HEAD DETECTIVE OF THE
SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT.

07:01.180 --> 07:04.149
- OH, GET OUT OF THIS CONDO!

07:04.190 --> 07:05.839
- I NEED YOU TO DO SOMETHING
FOR ME, SALLY.

07:05.890 --> 07:07.755
- AMY.
- I NEED YOU TO SPREAD THE WORD

07:07.790 --> 07:09.451
THAT THERE'S
A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.684
AND I'M GOING TO BE DOING
BACKGROUND CHECKS

07:10.730 --> 07:11.822
ON EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING,

07:11.860 --> 07:13.748
INCLUDING THAT DUPLICITOUS
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD NEXT DOOR.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.065
- GOOD, 'CAUSE HE'S
A FULL-ON LITTLE D-BAG.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.022
HEY, ANY CHANCE
YOU COULD GET LLOYD

07:19.070 --> 07:20.628
TO REPLACE
THAT HIDEOUS AWNING?

07:20.670 --> 07:24.208
- CONSIDER IT DONE.
I LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED, AMY.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.208
NOW GO SPREAD THAT WORD.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.377
SPREAD IT DOOR-TO-DOOR

07:27.410 --> 07:30.641
LIKE A NORTHWEST WILDFIRE
BEING FED BY AN AUGUST WIND.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.238
- YOU'RE KIND OF SUPER AWESOME.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.942
- THANKS FOR NOTICING.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.619
AND LISTEN, IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING, I'M--

07:39.960 --> 07:42.110

09:47.850 --> 09:49.647
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:49.690 --> 09:51.317
- GUS...
[sighs]

09:51.350 --> 09:53.682
I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.
- HMM.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.711
- IT TURNS OUT THAT TOYS

09:55.760 --> 09:57.682
ARE NOT THE SAFEST PLACE
TO HIDE EXPENSIVE JEWELRY.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.719
- YEAH.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.327
HEY, LASSIE!

10:01.360 --> 10:02.861
WHAT, DID YOU COME BY
TO THANK US

10:02.900 --> 10:04.765
IN PERSON
FOR YOUR HOUSEWARMING GIFT?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.836
- I'M HERE BECAUSE I HAVE A...

10:06.870 --> 10:09.191
SITUATION AT MY NEW CONDO.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.969
- DEAD HOOKERS?
- ROBOT COCKROACHES?

10:11.010 --> 10:13.672
- I HEARD THINGS.

10:13.710 --> 10:14.802
- ALL RIGHT.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.649
TAKE A LOAD OFF, LASSIE.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.147
WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:18.180 --> 10:21.843
- JUST STRANGE SOUNDS AND...

10:21.880 --> 10:24.815
JIGGLING AND HISSING, AND...

10:24.850 --> 10:27.887
I ALSO, UM, SAW SOME THINGS.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.320
- WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

10:30.360 --> 10:33.249
- JUST GENERAL
SPOOKY-TYPE THINGS,

10:33.300 --> 10:35.928
THINGS THAT ARE HARD
TO EXPLAIN, LIKE, UM...

10:35.960 --> 10:37.769
PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE
WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE

10:37.800 --> 10:38.926
AND SHOULD BE WHEN THEY AREN'T.

10:38.970 --> 10:42.030
AND, UM, THERE WERE SOME CHAIRS
THAT MOVED ON THEIR OWN.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.935
- SURE.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.935
YOUR PLACE IS HAUNTED!

10:48.980 --> 10:50.743
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.849
IT IS NOT HAUNTED,
YOU SIMPLETONS.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.246
IT'S JUST--IT'S NOTHING
MORE THAN NONSENSE PROBABLY,

10:54.280 --> 10:55.975
AND SINCE NONSENSE
IS YOUR SPECIALTY,

10:57.790 --> 10:58.848
- WE APPRECIATE THAT.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.710
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.318
- STANDARD HIRING CONTRACT.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.281
- LEGAL STIPU LATIONS,

11:03.330 --> 11:05.321
SEXUAL-HARASSMENT GUIDELINES,
LABOR LAWS.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.850
- AND AN ENVELOPE FOR PER DIEM.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.152
THAT'S 60 BONES PER DUDE
AND A SLUSHY FUND.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.293
- THAT'S MONEY SET ASIDE
STRICTLY FOR SLUSHIES.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.890
- YOU TWO MORONS ARE REALLY
ENJOYING THIS, AREN'T YOU?

11:13.940 --> 11:15.168
[both laugh]

11:15.200 --> 11:16.736
- NOT AT ALLNCNOT REALLY.

11:16.770 --> 11:17.930
- I WILL PAY
YOUR STANDARD FLAT RATE,

11:17.970 --> 11:19.198
NOT A PENNY MORE--
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.798
- WE WILL TAKE IT.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.876
- YOU KNOW THE ADDRESS.

11:22.910 --> 11:25.003
MEET ME
AT THE CONDO AT 6:00.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.348
DON'T BE LATE.
- YOU GOT IT.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.824
- YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M UPSET, RIGHT?

11:37.860 --> 11:40.328
- LASSIE, WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR ANY AND ALL SCENARIOS.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.726
- INCLUDING ONES
THAT MAY INVOLVE SPIRITS,

11:42.770 --> 11:43.691
SHADES, OR SPRITES,

11:43.730 --> 11:45.823
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW
IT'S NOT ANY OF THAT.

11:45.870 --> 11:48.498
- TAKE THOSE OFF, GUSTER.
- OKAY.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.235
- NOW, LISTEN, IF ANYONE
IN THE BUILDING

11:50.270 --> 11:53.103
INQUIRES ABOUT YOUR PRESENCE,
YOU'RE HERE FOR A SLEEPOVER.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.505
- [groans softly]

11:54.540 --> 11:55.438
- OKAY, NOT A SLEEPOVER.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.870
YOU'RE HERE
ON OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.514
both: AGREED.

12:00.550 --> 12:03.041
[elevator bell dings]
- LET'S DO THIS.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.187
- OOH, HOWDY, NEIGHBOR!

12:07.220 --> 12:08.858
SO, YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST TALKING TO LLOYD,

12:08.890 --> 12:10.380
AND I WAS TELLING HIM
THAT I THINK

12:10.430 --> 12:11.886
WE NEED A VEGETABLE GARDEN
ON THE ROOF.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.295
AND HE WAS ALL, "SCREW OFF,"

12:13.330 --> 12:14.888
AND I WAS ALL LIKE,
"YOU'RE HILARIOUS."

12:14.930 --> 12:16.249
[giggIeSJ
HAD TO BE THERE.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.289
ANYWAY, WHO ARE YOU FRIENDS?

12:17.330 --> 12:20.834
- SHAWN SPENCER--

12:20.870 --> 12:23.009
THIS IS MY PARTNER--

12:27.380 --> 12:29.029
I GOT TO GET UP

12:29.080 --> 12:30.308
- [laughing]
THEY'RE JOKING.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.443
THEY'RE HERE
ON OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.347
- MM, COPY THAT, PONCHARELLO.
THAT'S THE HAPS.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.985
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SAY,
I FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER

12:38.020 --> 12:40.989
HAVING A BIG, STRONG
MAN IN BLUE ON THE BEAT.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.181
[laughs]
OOH, GOT TO GET OFF TO WORK.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.527
NICE TO MEET YOU, SHAWN...

12:44.560 --> 12:45.788
[seductively]
FELLATIO.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.196
[elevator door opens]

12:48.230 --> 12:51.825
[thud]
OOH!

12:56.570 --> 12:58.003

12:58.040 --> 12:59.507
- HELLO, ROSE MARIE.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.337
- HELLO, CARLTON.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.871
- I SEE YOU'RE STILL
WITH CHILD.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.798
- YEP, THAT'S SORT OF
HOW IT WORKS

13:05.850 --> 13:08.011
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT
AND HAVEN'T HAD THE BABY YET.

13:08.050 --> 13:11.349
- [chuckles]

13:11.390 --> 13:14.951
HEY, ROSE MARIE, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'VE GIVEN ANY MORE THOUGHT

13:14.990 --> 13:15.957
TO SOUNDPROOFING
THE WALL WE SHARE

13:15.990 --> 13:18.584
IN ANTICIPATION
OF YOUR OFFSPRING HAVING COLIC?

13:18.630 --> 13:20.825
- I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'VE GIVEN ANY MORE THOUGHT

13:20.860 --> 13:22.896
TO KISSING MY FAT,
PREGNANT--

13:22.930 --> 13:26.024
- JELLY BEAN,
GIVE ME THOSE BAGS!

13:26.070 --> 13:27.958
HEY, CARLTON, HOW ARE YOU?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.365
- HELLO, ED.
I'M FINE.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.209
- TONY, COME HOME,
SWEETIE.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.879
- SO, LISTEN, WE'RE DOING
MOVIE NIGHT TONIGHT,

13:33.910 --> 13:35.878
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO DO,

13:35.910 --> 13:36.808
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON BY?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.545
- LASSIE, CAN WE?
CAN WE, CAN WE, CAN WE?

13:38.580 --> 13:40.844
- OH, GOSH DARN IT, ED.
THAT SOUNDS REALLY FUN.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.189
BUT THEY'RE HERE
ON OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.381
- WELL, UH, UH,
NEXT TIME, THEN.

13:47.290 --> 13:50.453
[creepy music]

13:50.490 --> 13:52.253
SAY, UH, CARLTON...

13:52.290 --> 13:54.099
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

13:54.130 --> 13:56.018
[both laugh]

13:56.060 --> 13:58.893
- I DO NOT LIKE THOSE PEOPLE.

13:58.930 --> 14:01.364
- SO WHERE'D YOU SEE
THOSE GHOSTLY NUDE TWINS?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.004
- THEY WEREN'T NUDE.
THEY WERE ELDERLY.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.531
- MAYBE IN YOUR IMAGINATION.

14:05.570 --> 14:08.903
- DOWN AT THE END OF THE HALL.

14:11.310 --> 14:14.108
- IT'S A HALLWAY,
NOT A NIGHTCLUB.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.970
JERKS.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.044
[door slams]

14:17.090 --> 14:18.614
- THAT'S ART.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.584
HE WAS IN KOREA.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.087
LLOYD, MY GOOD MAN.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.427
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.951
LET'S KEEP THOSE LIGHTBULBS
UNDER 60 WATTS, HUH?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.558
THE OLD GIRL'S WIRING
WASN'T BUILT FOR SPEED.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.498
- MM-HMM.
- CARRY ON.

14:30.530 --> 14:33.192
- AH, AH, DON'T YOU
EVER TOUCH ME, SON.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.164
- DULY NOTED.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.633
MY APOLOGIES.

14:37.670 --> 14:40.138
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.535
[vacuum whirring]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:42.580 --> 14:44.138
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:44.180 --> 14:46.569
[whirring continues]

14:51.420 --> 14:54.184
WHAT ARE YOU--

14:54.220 --> 14:55.949
- WELL, HELLO, LADIES.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.218
both: YES?

14:57.260 --> 14:58.522
- CAN WE...
- HELP YOU?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.699
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I HAVE THE WRONG CONDO.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.095
MY BAD.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.927
both:
GOOD DAY.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.695
- THAT WILL BE $1,000.

15:08.740 --> 15:12.198
- FINE. SO THE CREEPY TWINS
LIVE IN THE BUILDING.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.673
BUT I HAVEN'T TOUCHED
MY CHAIRS

15:13.710 --> 15:16.372
SINCE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
PUT THEM ON TOP OF THE TABLE.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.541
NO.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.218
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.115
NO, THIS--
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

15:24.150 --> 15:26.038
- UH-OH.
- THAT'LL BE ANOTHER $1,000.

15:26.090 --> 15:26.909
- YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.382
SOMETHING STRANGE
IS OCCURRING HERE.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.557
- LASSIE, YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

15:29.590 --> 15:30.955
HOW BADLY I WANTED THOSE TWINS

15:30.990 --> 15:32.628
TO BE A SET
OF FREAKISH APPARITIONS?

15:32.660 --> 15:34.719
- MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.
- PLACE LOOKS GREAT, BY THE WAY.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.692
- YEAH.

15:35.730 --> 15:37.288
- I THINK THIS IS JUST A CASE

15:37.330 --> 15:38.695
OF YOUR IMAGINATION
GETTING THE BEST OF YOU.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.595
HAPPENS TO GUS AND I
ONCE EVERY SEVEN DAYS.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.198
- THIS IS NOT MY IMAGINATION.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.309
ALL RIGHT, THINK ABOUT IT.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.534
HOW SURE MUSTI HAVE BEEN
THAT SOMETHING NEFARIOUS

15:44.570 --> 15:47.232
IS AT PLAY HERE FOR ME TO COME
TO YOU TWO DUNDERHEADS FOR HELP?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.679
- HMM...

15:48.710 --> 15:51.178
HE'S GOT A POINT.
[both mumbling]

15:52.450 --> 15:55.271
[both continue mumbling]

15:55.320 --> 15:56.275
[Shawn laughs]

15:56.320 --> 15:57.639
- STOP IT!

15:57.690 --> 15:58.987
STOP IT.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.112
- OKAY, WE'LL STAY.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.286
BUT WE NEED TO BE FREE
TO DO WHAT WE DO.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.457
- THERE'S AN INTENSITY
TO OUR WORK.

16:02.490 --> 16:04.651
- A FOCUS SO PURE THAT EVEN
THE SLIGHTEST DISTRACT ION

16:04.690 --> 16:06.749
COULD COST US VERY DEARLY.

16:06.790 --> 16:09.953
[metal detector beeps,
vacuum whirs]

16:13.100 --> 16:15.398
[Gus snoring]

16:15.440 --> 16:17.067
- GUS, GIVE ME YOUR FACE.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.338
- WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

16:18.370 --> 16:21.430
- WORTHLESS IDIOTS.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.048
- [snorts]
OH, I WANT TO BLOW THE BUBBLES!

16:28.080 --> 16:30.742
- GET IT, GIRL. GET IT.
[chuckles]

16:33.190 --> 16:36.409
[air hissing,
ghostly calling]

16:38.290 --> 16:41.726
- [laughs]

16:41.760 --> 16:43.159
- MARLOWE.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.738
[shower starts running]

17:49.630 --> 17:50.767
-AAH!

17:50.800 --> 17:54.167
- [choking]

17:54.200 --> 17:56.760
[glass shatters]

17:56.800 --> 17:59.234
- PSST.

17:59.270 --> 18:00.874
DID YOU HAVE
A BAD DREAM, BABY?

18:00.910 --> 18:02.707
-AAH! AAH!

18:02.740 --> 18:05.243
OOH!

18:05.280 --> 18:06.872
OH, MY GOD.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.775
WHAT THE HELL?

18:08.820 --> 18:10.708
- LASSIE!
- LASSIE!

18:10.750 --> 18:13.253
- WHAT?
- GET IN HERE!

18:13.290 --> 18:14.609
- GO TO SLEEP!

18:20.830 --> 18:23.594
SON OF...
[grunts]

18:23.630 --> 18:24.722
THIS BETTER BE GOOD!

18:24.770 --> 18:26.897
both: LASSIE!
- WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

18:26.930 --> 18:28.898
- LOOK!

18:28.940 --> 18:30.737
- IS THAT...

18:30.770 --> 18:31.737
BLOOD?

18:31.770 --> 18:35.274
[blood trickling]

18:43.490 --> 18:44.912
- WOODY, WE CAME RIGHT DOWN.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.350
- WHY DID YOU SEND US A 911 TEXT
WHEN WE WERE JUST UPSTAIRS?

18:47.390 --> 18:48.357
- NO, IT WAS A 711 TEXT,

18:48.390 --> 18:49.857
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD BRING ME A SLURPEE

18:49.890 --> 18:51.528
OR A QUESADILLA
IN THE SHAPE OF A TUBE.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.757
- DID YOU ANALYZE THE BLOOD FROM
MY LIGHT FIXTURE LIKE I ASKED?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.449
- I DID, BUT FIRST,

18:56.500 --> 18:58.297
MAY I INTEREST YOU
IN A GAME OF SHUFFLEBOARD?

18:58.330 --> 18:59.888
- OOH, ME FIRST!
- YES, PLEASE.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.830
- JUST SPIT IT OUT!
- THE BLOOD WASN'T HUMAN.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.269
- I'M SORRY?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.232
- THE BLOOD WASN'T--

19:05.270 --> 19:06.828
- CHUPACABRAS?
- DEAD ROBOT HOOKERS?

19:06.870 --> 19:08.770
- SOME KIND OF ANIMAL--

19:08.810 --> 19:10.801
ONE WITH ABNORMALLY HIGH
TRIGLYCERIDES

19:10.850 --> 19:12.909
AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN STD.

19:12.950 --> 19:15.373
- LLOYD'S RAT TRAPS.
[slams table]

19:15.420 --> 19:17.411
THAT'S IT--
HIS RAT TRAPS!

19:17.450 --> 19:21.454
SOME SORT
OF VERY, VERY LARGE RODENTIA

19:21.490 --> 19:22.616
GOT CAUGHT
IN ONE OF THE RAT TRAPS

19:22.660 --> 19:24.423
AND BLED OUT
INTO THE LIGHT FIXTURE.

19:24.460 --> 19:25.927
- HOW DOES THAT EXPLAIN
ALL THE OTHER WEIRD STUFF

19:25.960 --> 19:27.450
YOU'VE EXPERIENCED?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.663
- STRESS, EXHAUSTION,
PRESENCE OF YOU TWO NITWITS.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.668
OH, THIS IS SO STUPID,

19:32.700 --> 19:35.430
JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING, OKAY?

19:35.470 --> 19:39.406
DO NOT BREATHE A WORD
OF THIS TO ANYONE.

19:40.940 --> 19:43.443
- WHY WOULD WE SPREAD
THIS STORY AROUND?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.402
- SO CARLTON'S
NEW CONDO IS HAUNTED,

19:45.450 --> 19:47.475
AND HIS CEILING IS BLEEDING?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.771
- YES.
- IT ALL HAPPENED WHEN WE TOOK

19:48.820 --> 19:50.344
A LATE NIGHT TRIP
TO TIN KLETOWN.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.539
- NOT TOGETHER.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.218
- CARLTON, WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

19:54.260 --> 19:56.581
- THESE TWO HAPPENED.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.759
YOU KNOW, FELLAS,
I DIDN'T MENTION IT BEFORE

19:58.790 --> 20:00.428
BECAUSE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING--
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.324
- YOU'RE FIRED.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.920
AS USUAL, THANKS
FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.291
RAT TRAPS.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.389
- WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER
ABOUT LASSITER'S KITCHEN CHAIRS

20:08.440 --> 20:10.260
BEING MYSTERIOUSLY PLACED
ON TOP OF THE TABLE.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.629
- GUS, I'M NOT TELLING
JULIET ABOUT THINGS

20:11.670 --> 20:13.001
THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE
ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.429
OH, MY GOD.
I BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED!

20:15.480 --> 20:16.879
- I WAS AFRAID
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT.

20:16.910 --> 20:17.877
- THIS ISN'T A HAUNTING, GUS.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.673
SOMEONE'S BEHIND IT,
AND IF WE CAN PROVE WHO,

20:19.710 --> 20:21.439
LASSIE HAS TO PAY US
FOR SERVICES RENDERED.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.947
- THAT MIGHT BE
THE MOST PRAGMATIC THOUGHT

20:22.980 --> 20:24.379
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.308
BUT WHO'S DOING IT?

20:26.350 --> 20:27.351
- TONIGHT'S MOVIE NIGHT.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.618
SO, IF YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.548
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON BY?

20:30.590 --> 20:31.921
- THERE WAS A COMPETING BID
ON THE PLACE,

20:31.960 --> 20:33.848
BUT I SQUASHED THAT
LIKE A BUG.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.789
- LASSIE'S NEIGHBORS--
THE FARROWS.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.991
- REALLY?
THEY SEEM PRETTY NORMAL TO ME.

20:39.030 --> 20:43.467
- I WILL SPILL MY OWN BLOOD

20:43.510 --> 20:47.298
TO DEFEND THINE HONOR
WITH MY LIFE.

20:47.340 --> 20:50.468
MY ONE, MY ONLY...

20:50.510 --> 20:52.899
CHAR-LINE.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.418
AAH!

20:55.450 --> 20:57.486
SO COLD.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.810
AND CURTAIN.

21:00.860 --> 21:04.523
- [laughs, applauds]

21:04.560 --> 21:07.552
- NOW, WHERE WERE WE
BEFORE WE WERE INTERRUPTED

21:07.600 --> 21:09.852
BY MY IMPROMPTU PERFORMANCE?

21:09.900 --> 21:13.028
- WE ARE AWARE THAT YOU HAVE
INTEREST IN THE CONDO NEXT DOOR.

21:13.070 --> 21:14.389
EXPANDING YOUR SPACE?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.465
- WELL, YES, OF COURSE
WE WERE INTERESTED,

21:16.500 --> 21:19.469
ESPECIALLY WITH A NEW BABY
ON THE WAY.

21:19.510 --> 21:21.876
- AND, YES, I HAD
SOME PLANS DRAWN UP.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.572
IT WAS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE--
ONE BIG PENTHOUSE.

21:24.610 --> 21:25.577
_ "WAS"?

21:25.610 --> 21:28.613
- WE OWNED A LINGERIE STORE...

21:28.650 --> 21:29.969
FRISKY BUSINESS.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.818
WE HAD TO CLOSE THE DOORS
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.455
- SO, UNTIL WE GET
BACK ON OUR FEET,

21:35.490 --> 21:37.685
WE HAVE TO PUT
OUR PLANS ON HOLD.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.652
WE EVEN WITHDREW
OUR OFFER ON 536.

21:39.690 --> 21:41.897
- AND AS FAR AS ANYTHING
STRANGE GOING ON HERE

21:41.930 --> 21:44.660
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS,
WE ONLY GOT IN TOWN YESTERDAY,

21:44.700 --> 21:47.396
AND LAST NIGHT WE HAD TO TAKE
TONY TO THE EMERGENCY CLINIC.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.738
HE WAS RUNNING
A VERY, VERY HIGH FEVER.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.347
- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

21:59.380 --> 22:00.540
- ONE LAST QUESTION--

22:00.580 --> 22:03.014
IS THERE ANY MERCHANDISE LEFT
OVER FROM FRISKY BUSINESS?

22:03.050 --> 22:06.417
- WELL, OKAY, LLOYD, BUT
AS LONG AS WE ARE IN AGREEMENT

22:06.450 --> 22:08.111
THAT THAT AWNING
IS A REAL EYESORE AND--

22:08.160 --> 22:09.513
- I'M CHANGING IT!

22:09.560 --> 22:12.381
[door slams]

22:12.430 --> 22:15.456
- RUDE.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.468
OOH! HELLO.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.627
[gasps] YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS JUST THINKING?

22:19.670 --> 22:21.865
I SHOULD PUT TOGETHER
A CAMPING TRIP--I LOVE TO CAMP.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.561
DO YOU LOVE CAMPING?
I LOVE CAMPING.

22:23.610 --> 22:26.135
THE WHOLE BUILDING
COULD GO CAMPING!

22:26.170 --> 22:27.979
THINK ON THIS.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.369
[giggIeSJ

22:34.680 --> 22:36.568
- YOU LIKED THAT?
- I DIDN'T MIND IT.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.456
- LLOYD, MY GOOD MAN,
I'M SHAWN SPENCER.

22:46.490 --> 22:50.153
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
EDDIE ADAMS FROM TORRANCE.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.130
YOU HAD YOUR HAND
IN A DEAD MAN'S FRIDGE.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.468
- MAY WE SNEAK A WORD
WITH YOU?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.138
- COME ON IN.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.475
- LLOYD?

23:04.510 --> 23:08.173
HE DID TELL US TO COME IN.
- I GUESS SO.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.484
- WHERE'D HE GO?

23:10.520 --> 23:13.978
- [knocks]
HEY, LLOYD!

23:14.020 --> 23:16.159
REALLY LOVE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.429
CLEAN LINES.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.861
- THIS IS DISGUSTING.
WHO LIVES LIKE THIS?

23:26.770 --> 23:28.465
- AAH! WOW.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.730
[laughs] LLOYD.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.169
SILLY MAN.
[laughs]

23:32.210 --> 23:33.268
UH...

23:33.310 --> 23:36.507
WE--WE ARE HERE TO ASK YOU
KIND OF AN ODD QUESTION.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.644
- THERE'S NOTHING AROUND
HERE THAT SEEMS ODD,

23:38.680 --> 23:40.147
AT LEAST IF YOU'VE SEEN
WHAT I'VE HEARD

23:40.180 --> 23:41.670
AND HEARD WHAT I'VE SEEN.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.585
- SO YOU'RE AWARE
OF THE UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA

23:43.620 --> 23:44.882
IN UNIT 536?

23:44.920 --> 23:47.650
- WELL THE BUSINESS
IN UNIT 536 AIN'T UNEXPLAINED.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.214
- THAT'S WHAT WE WERE THINKING.
- RIGHT.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.955
- I TOLD YOU WE CAME
TO THE RIGHT DUDE.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.981
- WE THINK SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO SCARE CARLTON LASSITER

23:53.030 --> 23:54.622
OUT OF 536.

23:54.660 --> 23:58.562
- YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I KNOW
WHO THE CULPRIT IS.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.534
- OH, OKAY.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.959
- CONDO 536.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.639
- HMM.
- I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.479
- NO, WAIT, WAIT.
I'VE SEEN IT.

24:07.510 --> 24:10.502
SOUND-MINDED MEN
MOVE IN THERE.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.506
THEN THEY BEGIN TO UNRAVEL.

24:12.550 --> 24:13.972
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT...

24:14.020 --> 24:17.217
THEY'RE DELIVERED
INTO THE MOUTH OF MADNESS.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.048
CONDO 536 HAS A CURSE
WITHIN ITS WALLS.

24:20.090 --> 24:22.650
- SHAWN...

24:22.690 --> 24:24.829
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

24:24.860 --> 24:27.522
- THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, LLOYD.

24:31.530 --> 24:33.862
[sighs]
ALL RIGHT, PAPA BEAR...

24:33.900 --> 24:36.039
PREVIOUS RESIDENTS
OF LASSIE'S PLACE--GO.

24:36.070 --> 24:37.537
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,

24:37.570 --> 24:39.003
THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING STRANGE GOING ON HERE.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.009
IT SAYS THAT A GUY NAMED
RAY BRAUER LIVED IN CONDO 536

24:42.040 --> 24:43.598
FOR ABOUT TH REE YEARS,
BEFORE ONE DAY,

24:43.650 --> 24:45.800
HE DECIDES TO TAKE A FLYING LEAP
OUT THE BEDROOM WINDOW--

24:45.850 --> 24:46.805
DEAD AT THE SCENE.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.841
- WHAT?
- SO THE LAST TWO GUYS

24:48.880 --> 24:50.643
WHO LIVED IN LASSITER'S PLACE
TOOK THEIR OWN LIVES?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.782
- YEAH, APPARENTLY.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.788
NOW, ACCORDING TO THIS,
BRAUER WAS INCREASINGLY ERRATIC

24:53.820 --> 24:55.583
BEFORE HE TOOK THE BIG PLUNGE.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.985
NOW, I'M NO EXPERT
IN THIS STUFF,

24:57.020 --> 24:59.580
BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WEIRD GOING ON HERE.

24:59.630 --> 25:01.257
- IT'S NOT HAUNTED.
- NO, IT ISN'T.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.154
- I THINK IT'S HAUNTED.
- IT PROBABLY IS.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.519
- GUS!
- WHAT?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.389
- SHAWN.

25:05.430 --> 25:06.829
I'VE BEEN DOING
A LITTLE MORE DIGGING

25:06.870 --> 25:08.235
INTO THE HISTORY
OF LASSITER'S BUILDING.

25:08.270 --> 25:09.669
IT GETS EVEN MORE WEIRD.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.236
- I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

25:11.270 --> 25:12.635
- PROSPECT GARDENS' ARCHITECT

25:12.670 --> 25:14.308
WAS A MAN NAMED
J. MICHAEL HAGEMAN,

25:14.340 --> 25:16.535
WHO CONCEIVED IT
AS HIS MASTERPIECE.

25:16.580 --> 25:17.569
BUT THE PROJECT
HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS,

25:17.610 --> 25:19.942
LIKE STRUCTURAL ISSUES,
A SERIES OF CONTRACTORS,

25:19.980 --> 25:22.847
AND EVENTUALLY HE SAW HIS PET
PROJECT AS A COLOSSAL FAILURE.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.586
IT WAS REPORTED
THAT HIS BEHAVIOR

25:24.620 --> 25:26.918
BECAME MORE AND MORE ERRATIC,
AND THEN HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.315
- WAS HE EVER FOUND?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.157
- THREE DAYS LATER,
IN THE BUILDING,

25:30.190 --> 25:33.284
DEAD ALONG WITH HIS WIFE--
MURDER-SUICIDE.

25:33.330 --> 25:34.490
- IT'S HAUNTED.
IT'S HAUNTED!

25:34.530 --> 25:36.828
- I'M WITH GUS ON THIS ONE.
- WOULD YOU TWO PLEASE STOP?

25:36.860 --> 25:37.861
- ALL I'M SAYING IS SOMEONE

25:37.900 --> 25:39.663
OTHER THAN ME MIGHT WANT
TO GO CHECK ON LASSIE

25:39.700 --> 25:41.236
TO MAKE SURE THE CONDO
HASN'T TAKEN HIM.

25:41.270 --> 25:42.259
- [sighs]

25:42.300 --> 25:44.666
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.701
- OTHER THAN ME.
OTHER THAN ME, SHAWN!

25:49.640 --> 25:52.006
[elevator bell dings]
- IT'S A COINCIDENCE, GUS.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.677
- DID YOU EVEN LISTEN
TO JULIET'S STORY?

25:53.720 --> 25:55.676
- WHAT, SOME HACK ARCHITECT
HAS A MEAN WIFE?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.039
IT'S A TALE AS OLD AS TIME.

25:57.080 --> 26:01.016
BUILDINGS
DO NOT DRIVE PEOPLE CRAZY.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.722
[static hissing on television]

26:16.770 --> 26:19.204
LASSIE?

26:20.340 --> 26:22.774
- LASSITER?
- HMM.

26:25.310 --> 26:28.347
[giggling]

26:34.020 --> 26:35.317
- WOODY, YOU GOT
TO GIVE US SOMETHING.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.624
LASSIE'S OFF HIS TREE,
AND HE'S ONLY GETTING WORSE.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.958
- MY BRETHREN, THE DEATH
OF MARC STEVEN WARAFTIG

26:39.990 --> 26:41.958
HAS ME VEXED.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.353
BLOOD SCREEN SAYS
THE MAN'S BLOOD CONTAINED

26:43.400 --> 26:44.867
A SURPRISING AMOUNT
OF AMYL NITRITE.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.266
- POPPERS?
- SUPER JOB, GUSTER--

26:50.000 --> 26:51.968
USUALLY BEFORE A LONG SHIFT.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.838
- BUT HIS SNACKS
ARE DISGUSTING--WAY TOO HEALTHY.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.142
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.068
WARAFTIG WAS SOME SORT
OF HEALTH NUT.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.273
WOODY, CAN YOU PULL UP THE
AUTOPSY REPORT FOR A RAY BRAUER?

27:05.350 --> 27:08.410
- OH, BOY.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.849
- NO.
- YES.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.152
- WOWZA.

27:12.190 --> 27:14.954
SWAN-DIVE OUT
HIS BEDROOM WINDOW.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.422
I ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY THAT.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.826
- TRACES OF AMYL NITRITE
IN HIS SYSTEM!

27:18.870 --> 27:19.996
GUYS, THAT MUST BE IT!

27:20.030 --> 27:22.965
THIS PSYCHOACT IVE DRUG DROVE
BRAUER AND WARAFTIG CRAZY,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.139
AND NOW SOMEONE'S TRYING TO DO
THE SAME THING TO LASSIE.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.035
CLEARLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE BUILDING

27:27.070 --> 27:28.674
AND HAS ACCESS TO THE UNITS.

27:28.710 --> 27:29.779
LLOYD.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.878
- THIS IS EXHAUSTING.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.911
REMIND ME AGAIN WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR?

27:38.950 --> 27:41.054
- I DON'T KNOW--
ANYTHING THAT'LL LET US KNOW

27:41.090 --> 27:44.355
WHY LLOYD HAD IT IN
FOR THE GUYS OF 536.

27:44.390 --> 27:47.791
- DUDE, THIS IS THE HOUSEWARMING
GIFT WE GOT LASSIE.

27:47.830 --> 27:48.854
REMEMBER?

27:48.900 --> 27:50.094
- A.S.P.C.A. GIFT CARD?

27:50.130 --> 27:51.961
BUT WE MADE A DONATION
IN LASSITER'S NAME

27:52.000 --> 27:53.991
ON BEHALF
OF SQUIRRELS EVERYWHERE.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.462
QUESTION IS,
WHY DOES LLOYD HAVE IT?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.388
- BECAUSE LLOYD IS STEALING
FROM HIS RESIDENTS.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.998
THIS IS ROSE MARIE'S HAT.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.008
- BASED ON THIS RANDOM
COLLECTION OF JUNK,

28:01.040 --> 28:04.077
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG
HE'S BEEN THIEVING?

28:04.110 --> 28:05.805
- THIS GUY'S A SERIOUS KLEPTO.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.977
I THINK HE HAS
ONE OF AMY'S PAYCHECKS.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.945
- GUS...

28:12.990 --> 28:15.015
THIS IS THE STUFF WOODY
WAS TALKING ABOUT--

28:15.060 --> 28:16.413
AMYL NITRITE.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.122
- THE STUFF THAT WAS FOUND
IN THE TWO DEAD GUYS FROM 536.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.095
- YEAH, LLOYD
IS LITERALLY GASSING THEM.

28:22.130 --> 28:24.098
[sighs] UH, GO UP
TO LASSIE'S PLACE.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.098
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY TRACES OF THIS STUFF.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.939
I'M GOING TO CALL JULIET
AND LOOK FOR LLOYD.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.460
- WHY DO I HAVE TO GO
TO LASSIE'S?

28:29.500 --> 28:31.263
- YOU WOULD RATHER GO LOOK
FOR LLOYD IN SOME DARK CORNER?

28:31.310 --> 28:33.062
- I'M GOING TO LASSIE'S.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.801
[knock at door]

28:36.840 --> 28:38.376
LASSIE?

28:42.220 --> 28:43.983
LASSITER?

29:20.320 --> 29:22.459
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, GUSTER?

29:22.490 --> 29:26.051
- LASSIE.
OH, LISTEN...

29:26.090 --> 29:27.955
SOMEONE HAS BEEN MESSING
WITH YOUR PLACE.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.898
AND WE KNOW WHO IT IS.

29:28.930 --> 29:30.898
- SO DO I.
- YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR RIGHT MIND

29:30.930 --> 29:32.466
'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN BREATHING
A DANGEROUS CHEMICAL--

29:32.500 --> 29:33.467
THIS STUFF.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.933
- RIGHT...

29:34.970 --> 29:37.097
BECAUSE YOU PUT IT
THERE JUST NOW.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.802
- NO, I FOUND IT.
[glass breaks]

29:39.840 --> 29:43.037
- THERE IS NO LIMIT TO HOW FAR
YOU AND SPENCER WILL GO

29:43.080 --> 29:44.308
TO MESS WITH ME, IS THERE?

29:44.350 --> 29:46.306
- OKAY, LASSIE, JUST TRY
TO PULL IT TOGETHER.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.545
- AND WHY? BECAUSE I AM MOVING
FORWARD IN MY LIFE,

29:48.580 --> 29:51.549
AND I HAVE FINALLY SCRATCHED OUT
A LITTLE BIT OF HAPPINESS

29:51.590 --> 29:53.148
AND YOU TWO
CAN'T STAND TO SEE IT!

29:53.190 --> 29:55.818
- WELL...
- ESPECIALLY YOU.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.885
I MEAN, AT LEAST SPENCER
HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.022
- THAT'S COLD-BLOODED, LASSIE.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.358
- HERE'S THE JUICE, GUSTER.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.049
I WILL PREVAIL.

30:03.100 --> 30:06.490
I HAVE WORKED TOO LONG AND
TOO HARD TO GET TO WHERE I AM,

30:06.530 --> 30:09.363
AND I AM NOT ABOUT TO LET
YOU TWO TAKE THIS AWAY FROM ME.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.039
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

30:12.070 --> 30:13.970
STAY HERE AND RELAX.
I'M GOING TO GET YOU SOME HELP.

30:14.010 --> 30:16.035
- YOU'RE NOT GOING ANWVHERE.
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

30:18.050 --> 30:20.006
ARE YOU CRAZY?

30:20.050 --> 30:21.415
- EN GARDE.

30:22.950 --> 30:25.089
- LASSIE, LASSIE!
- [growls]

30:28.090 --> 30:31.981
AAH!
OH, STRIKE ONE!

30:32.030 --> 30:34.248
[pot breaks]

30:34.300 --> 30:36.598
- HEY, JULES.

30:36.630 --> 30:38.461
I NEED YOU TO COME DOWN
TO PROSPECT GARDENS

30:38.500 --> 30:40.934
AND ASK LLOYD THE MANAGER
A FEW QUESTIONS.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.501
- GUSTER!

30:49.540 --> 30:51.872
[electricity crackling loudly]

30:51.910 --> 30:54.879
GUSTER, COME OUT AND PLAY!

30:57.020 --> 30:58.510
- THE REASON THOSE GUYS
KILLED THEMSELVES

30:58.550 --> 31:00.211
IS BECAUSE THEY WERE
OUT OF THEIR HEADS,

31:00.250 --> 31:01.911
JUST LIKE YOU!

31:01.960 --> 31:03.882
- [eerily]
GUSTER.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.329
[metallic crash]

31:05.360 --> 31:08.329
OW!
[shouting indistinctly]

31:13.030 --> 31:15.066
YOU CAN RUN,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE!

31:20.980 --> 31:23.335
GUSTER!

31:27.410 --> 31:29.514
[whistles]

31:37.260 --> 31:40.320
[elevator music]

31:40.360 --> 31:42.521
*

31:42.560 --> 31:45.996
[elevator whirs]
- THAT WAS DUMB.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.401
[sword clacking]

31:56.680 --> 31:59.979
- GUSTER!

32:00.010 --> 32:03.047
IT'S TIME TO COME OUT!

32:03.080 --> 32:06.015
[phone vibrates]

32:08.060 --> 32:09.118
- GUS.

32:11.090 --> 32:13.479
- BOO!
- AAH!

32:16.200 --> 32:19.624
- GUSTER! COME ON!

32:19.670 --> 32:21.467
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN!

32:21.500 --> 32:23.730
- IT WASN'T ME!
IT WAS LLOYD!

32:23.770 --> 32:25.306
LLOYD IS THE ONE
WHO'S DOING THIS!

32:25.340 --> 32:27.467
- OKAY...

32:27.510 --> 32:28.636
YOU WIN.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.001
I GUESS
I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE.

32:33.650 --> 32:34.674
- YOU'RE NOT LEAVING.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.642
YOU'RE JUST
MAKING FOOTSTEP SOUNDS!

32:36.680 --> 32:38.409
- FINE.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.384
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

32:40.420 --> 32:41.387
AAH!

32:41.420 --> 32:42.751
-AAH!

32:42.790 --> 32:44.382
-AAH!

32:44.430 --> 32:47.058
-AAH!

32:47.090 --> 32:48.751
-AAH!
-AAH!

32:48.800 --> 32:51.564
- DAMN IT, THIS DOOR'S
REALLY SOLID.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.192
- [whimpering]
I THINK IT'S OAK.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.233
- I GUESS I BETTER JUST
HUFF AND PUFF ON THIS ONE!

32:56.270 --> 32:57.237
AAH!

32:57.270 --> 32:59.101
-AAH!

32:59.140 --> 33:02.132
AAH!

33:02.180 --> 33:04.740
AAH!

33:04.780 --> 33:07.044
- HEY, GUSTER?
- YEAH?

33:07.080 --> 33:08.445
- YOU KNOW, AT THIS RATE, THIS
IS GOING TO TAKE ME FOREVER.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.710
SO, UH, HOW ABOUT YOU
HELP A BROTHER OUT

33:10.750 --> 33:12.741
AND UNLOCK THE DOOR, HUH?

33:12.790 --> 33:14.712
- SO YOU CAN KILL ME?
HELL, NO!

33:14.760 --> 33:16.159
- I GUESS
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS

33:16.190 --> 33:17.350
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, THEN.

33:17.390 --> 33:18.482
-AAH!

33:20.830 --> 33:24.527
AAH!

33:24.570 --> 33:26.299
STOP, STOP!

33:27.770 --> 33:30.591
TONY, TONY, HELP ME!
HELP ME!

33:34.140 --> 33:35.778
- TOUGH LUCK, GUSTER.

33:38.810 --> 33:41.347
- NO, PLEASE!
PLEASE DON'T!

33:42.780 --> 33:44.441
- OH.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.414
- THAT'S IT, LASSIE!
IT WASN'T GUS! IT WAS LLOYD!

33:47.450 --> 33:48.485
IT WAS LLOYD.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.782
- COOL.
YOU CAN LET ME UP NOW.

33:49.820 --> 33:53.483
- NO!
[rattling]

33:53.530 --> 33:55.054
WHAT IS THAT RATTLING?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.701
- IT WASN'T LLOYD.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.488
- ALL RIGHT...
[sighs]

34:19.520 --> 34:22.387
IF YOU COULD THINK
OF ONE THING IN THE WORLD

34:22.420 --> 34:26.322
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
RIGHT NOW, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

34:26.360 --> 34:29.625
- I WOULDN'T SAY NO
TO A SLOPPY JOE.

34:29.660 --> 34:31.218
- [chuckles]

34:34.200 --> 34:36.794
- THANK YOU.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.330
MM!

34:38.370 --> 34:40.509
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,
SPENCER?

34:40.540 --> 34:42.508
- AH, THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS GAZPACHO.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.509
IT'S VERY REFRESHING.

34:45.550 --> 34:46.778
MMM.

34:46.810 --> 34:48.414
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

34:48.450 --> 34:50.645
WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK AT
THE STATION IF YOU ALL NEED US.

34:50.680 --> 34:52.511
- OH, I'M SO SORE.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.552
SORRY I TRIED TO KILL YOU
WITH MY SWORD, GUSTER.

35:02.530 --> 35:05.499
- SHAWN,
IF LLOYD ISN'T OUR KILLER,

35:05.530 --> 35:07.418
THEN WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?

35:07.470 --> 35:09.438
THIS GUY'S A SERIOUS KLEPTO.

35:09.470 --> 35:12.337
I THINK HE HAS ONE
OF AMY'S PAYCHECKS.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.906
- WE NEED TO GET BACK
IN LLOYD'S PLACE.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.578
- WHAT? WHY?

35:15.610 --> 35:18.875
- ARE YOU GOING TO EXPLAIN
TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON, SHAWN?

35:18.910 --> 35:20.400
- YES, GUS.
YES, I AM.

35:20.450 --> 35:22.475
AND IT IS A DOOZY.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.340
- [sighs] WE THOUGHT
THAT LLOYD HAD STOLEN

35:24.390 --> 35:26.142
ONE OF AMY'S PAYCHECKS.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.682
BUT UPON FURTHER INSPECTION,
IT'S NOT A PAYCHECK.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.679
- IT'S A BILL.

35:36.860 --> 35:39.590
- 237, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

35:39.630 --> 35:41.632
YOU DON'T WORK AT THE HOSPITAL,
DO YOU, AMY?

35:41.670 --> 35:44.366
WE PAID A LITTLE VISIT
TO A PSYCHIATRIST

35:44.410 --> 35:45.809
NAMED DR. ANCTIL.

35:45.840 --> 35:46.966
- YOU'RE HIS PATIENT.

35:47.010 --> 35:49.604
TOO BAD THE DOCTOR-PATIENT-
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

35:49.640 --> 35:51.403
IS MOOT WHEN YOU'RE SUSPECTED
OF MURDER.

35:51.450 --> 35:55.341
- YEAH, HE TOLD US
YOU HAVE MOMMY ISSUES...

35:55.380 --> 35:57.519
AND DADDY ISSUES...

35:57.550 --> 36:00.439
AND SOMETHING CALLED
ACUTE REJECT ION DISORDER--

36:00.490 --> 36:01.752
PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO

36:01.790 --> 36:03.781
WITH YOU BEING LEFT
AT THE ALTAR.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.458
- TWICE.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.526
- YOU FELL MADLY IN LOVE
WITH THE FIRST VICTIM,

36:07.560 --> 36:11.621
RAY BRAUER, BUT THE FEELINGS
JUST WEREN'T MUTUAL.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.559
SO YOU USED THE FOLKLORE
OF PROSPECT GARDENS--

36:14.600 --> 36:16.795
STORIES OF ITS HAUNTING BORNE
BY THE MURDER-SUICIDE

36:16.840 --> 36:20.503
COMMITTED BY THE BUILDING'S
ARCHITECT, J. MICHAEL HAGEMAN,

36:20.540 --> 36:21.802
MANY YEARS AGO.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.603
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.347
- YOU METHODICALLY MADE RAY
THINK HE WAS LOSING HIS MIND

36:26.380 --> 36:27.745
BY HAUNTING AND DRUGGING HIM

36:27.780 --> 36:30.442
AND EVENTUALLY PUSHING HIM OUT
OF HIS OWN BEDROOM WINDOW.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.310
- [smacks hands]

36:31.350 --> 36:33.386
- IT WORKED SO WELL
THAT YOU DECIDED

36:33.420 --> 36:34.819
TO DO THE SAME THING
AGAIN TO MARK,

36:34.860 --> 36:36.452
WHO ALSO GAVE YOU
THE COLD SHOULDER.

36:36.490 --> 36:38.321
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- AH-AH-AH.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.658
STILL NOT FINISHED,
BANANAS FOSTER,

36:40.690 --> 36:43.488
'CAUSE THERE'S
POOR, POOR LLOYD.

36:43.530 --> 36:45.589
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
OF KLEPTOMANIA,

36:45.630 --> 36:47.461
HIS STICKY FINGERS
FINALLY FOUND EVIDENCE

36:47.500 --> 36:50.560
THAT YOU WERE UP
TO SOME NASTY, NASTY BUSINESS.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.500
SO YOU KILLED HIM

36:52.540 --> 36:54.633
AND SOMEHOW FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO STUFF HIM

36:54.680 --> 36:56.534
INTO THE WORLD'S LARGEST
INDUSTRIAL DRYER.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.969
- AND PUT HIM ON A LONG CYCLE.

36:59.010 --> 37:01.444
- COPS ARE ON THEIR WAY, AMY.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.675
IT'S THE END OF THE LINE.
- SORRY.

37:06.950 --> 37:08.611
- [gasp5]
- OH!

37:08.660 --> 37:09.888
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

37:09.920 --> 37:12.650
- COME ON.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

37:16.700 --> 37:19.498
SHE'S GOT THE CRAZY
COURSING THROUGH HER LEGS!

37:25.470 --> 37:26.630
[panﬁng]
ALL RIGHT, STOP!

37:26.670 --> 37:28.570
STOP!
WE'RE WILDLY OUT OF SHAPE.

37:28.610 --> 37:29.770
- NO, HE'S OUT OF SHAPE.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.277
THE AIR'S TOO THIN
FOR ME UP HERE.

37:31.310 --> 37:33.949
- I KNOW WHY YOU WERE
HAUNTING LASSITER--

37:33.980 --> 37:35.777
HEAD DETECTIVE OF THE S.B.P.D.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.539
NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANY STONE
UNTURNED IN YOUR BUILDING--

37:38.590 --> 37:40.615
HAD TO TURN UP THE HEAT
TO GET RID OF HIM.

37:40.650 --> 37:41.685
JUST THROW IN THE TOWEL.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.381
WE CAN GET YOU THE HELP
THAT YOU NEED.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.559
LET IT END HERE.

37:45.590 --> 37:48.388
- "LET IT END HERE"?

37:48.430 --> 37:50.318
OKAY.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.420
- [groans]

37:55.540 --> 37:57.599
THERE'S SO MANY FLOORS...

37:57.640 --> 37:59.062
SO MANY FLOORS!

37:59.110 --> 38:01.670
GIVE IT UP, AMY!

38:01.710 --> 38:04.031
THERE'S NO ESCAPE NOW!

38:06.710 --> 38:08.416
WHERE'D SHE GO?

38:08.450 --> 38:11.419
THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST
ESCAPE STRATEGY, AMY.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.315
- UNLESS YOU LED US UP HERE
FOR SOME REASON.

38:13.350 --> 38:15.454
- FOR WHAT? WHAT? IT'S NOT LIKE
THERE'S AN AMAZING VIEW.

38:15.490 --> 38:17.708
- IT'S MOSTLY TREES.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.564
- [slowed]
AAH!

38:28.600 --> 38:31.296
AAH!

38:32.410 --> 38:36.733
- * AVE MAR--

38:36.780 --> 38:39.647
[thud]

38:39.680 --> 38:42.843
- GOOD THING LLOYD
REPLACED THAT AWNING.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.518
- YEAH, I GUESS.

38:44.550 --> 38:45.983
SHE'S CRAZY!

38:46.020 --> 38:48.580
SHE DID IT.

38:48.620 --> 38:54.490
- GET BACK!

38:54.530 --> 38:57.897
- HEY, DUDE, I REMEMBER WHERE
I HID THE RING.

38:57.930 --> 39:01.127
[toy squeaks]

39:01.170 --> 39:02.865
GUS, THAT WAS MONEY.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.960
[chuckles]
I MUST HAVE SHINED THAT TO YOU.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.899
- YOU CAN'T SHINE, SHAWN.
BUT YOU CAN USE YOUR BRAIN.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.931
- I DID. IAM.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.641
I'M GOING TO RE-HIDE THE RING.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.910
THIS TIME, I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO THREE SUPER-SECRET SPOTS.

39:14.950 --> 39:16.713
I WANT YOU TO PICK
YOUR FAVORITE ONE.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.741
READY?
REPTILE HOUSE...

39:18.790 --> 39:20.610
- HOW ABOUT YOU PUT IT
BACK IN THE DRAWER

39:20.650 --> 39:22.618
AT YOUR DAD'S HOUSE BEFORE
HE NOTICES THAT IT'S MISSING?

39:22.660 --> 39:23.786
- THAT'S NOT REALLY
HIDING IT, GUS.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.923
THAT'S MORE LIKE
GIVING IT BACK.

39:24.960 --> 39:25.927
- THAT'S RIGHT.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.382
OR ARE YOU KEEPING IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE PLANNING

39:27.430 --> 39:28.590
ON PROPOSING AGAIN?

39:28.630 --> 39:30.894
- NO, I TOLD YOU--THAT WAS NEVER
EVEN REALLY ON THE TABLE.

39:30.930 --> 39:32.591
- REALLY?

39:32.630 --> 39:33.927
- YEAH, FINE.

39:33.970 --> 39:35.835
JUST TO SHOW YOU
THAT I'M ON THE LEVEL,

39:35.870 --> 39:36.791
I'LL DO IT, ALL RIGHT?

39:36.840 --> 39:38.967
I WILL TAKE THE RING
BACK TO MY DAD'S HOUSE.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.637
- HMM.

39:40.670 --> 39:44.777
- BECAUSE MARRIAGE PROPOSAL IS
THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY MIND.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.971
[door closes]

39:47.010 --> 39:49.046
- MR. O'HARA?
- GUS.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.910
I HAVEN'T EATEN IN 72 HOURS.

39:52.950 --> 39:56.579
I NEED A SANDWICH AND
A COLD DRINK, NON-CARBONATED.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.487
SANDWICH SHOULD HAVE CHEESE,
BUT THAT'S NOT A DEAL BREAKER.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.122
I'M NOT A YOUNG MAN.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.798
- ALL RIGHT.

40:02.830 --> 40:06.596
- FRANK, HERE YOU ARE...
DRESSED LIKE THAT.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.837
I CAME AS SOON AS I GOT
YOUR VOICE MAIL.

40:08.870 --> 40:10.132
- VOICE MAIL?
- YOU LEFT ME

40:10.170 --> 40:12.536
AN URGENT MESSAGE SAYING
YOU WERE HEADED OUT

40:12.570 --> 40:14.106
FOR A WEEKEND GETAWAY
WITH MY DAUGHTER

40:14.140 --> 40:15.937
AND YOU WANTED TO TALK
TO ME FIRST.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.700
- OH, RIGHT, I DID NOT FORGET
THAT I DID THAT.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.809
BUT I LEFT YOU THAT MESSAGE
A WEEK AGO.

40:21.850 --> 40:23.715
WHERE WERE YOU?
- TANZANIA.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.217
- YOU CLIMBED KILIMANJARO?

40:25.250 --> 40:26.945
- GUS, DON'T MAKE UP WORDS.

40:26.990 --> 40:29.049
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN AUSTRALIA, FRANK?

40:29.090 --> 40:31.012
- SHAWN, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT YOU AND ME

40:31.060 --> 40:33.153
AND WHETHER OR NOT
I CONNED THE IGBOS

40:33.190 --> 40:36.956
INTO REVEALING THE LOCATION
OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL OF MAWIBI.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.992
I SENSE THAT YOU HAD AN URGENT
QUESTION ABOUT MY DAUGHTER,

40:40.030 --> 40:41.839
SO SPIT IT OUT.

40:41.870 --> 40:42.859
DON'T MINCE WORDS.

40:42.900 --> 40:45.164
- I GAMBLED AND WENT
WITH A PICKLE.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.939
- JACKPOT.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.130
- OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.604
I GOT THIS CRAZY IDEA
IN MY HEAD

40:50.640 --> 40:53.541
THAT JULES WANTED ME
TO PROPOSE MARRIAGE

40:53.580 --> 40:55.468
ON OUR VACATION, SO, UH...

40:55.520 --> 40:56.873
SO I CALLED YOU,

40:56.920 --> 40:59.138
AND--AND THEN I STOLE
MY GRANDMOTHER'S ENGAGEMENT RING

40:59.190 --> 41:00.942
FROM MY FATHER'S BEDROOM.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.982
WELL, ANYWAY, IT WAS A HUGE
MISUNDERSTANDING, THANK GOD.

41:04.020 --> 41:07.023
BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE
AND YOU TRAVELED ALL THAT WAY,

41:07.060 --> 41:09.995
MAYBE I SHOULD BANK
YOUR BLESSING

41:10.030 --> 41:12.521
IN CASE I NEED IT IN THE VERY,
VERY DISTANT FUTURE.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.993
- UM...

41:15.040 --> 41:17.065
SHAWN...

41:17.100 --> 41:20.035
I DON'T KNOW--
YOU'RE SHARP, BUT...

41:20.070 --> 41:23.278
I ALWAYS DREAMT THAT MY DAUGHTER
WOULD MARRY SOMEONE UNLIKE ME--

41:23.310 --> 41:24.572
SOMEONE HONEST.

41:24.610 --> 41:26.544
NOW LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME

41:26.580 --> 41:29.014
YOU'VE NEVER LIED
TO MY DAUGHTER, HUH?

41:29.050 --> 41:30.847
YEAH, BIRDS OF A FEATHER.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.883
I'VE ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE
WITH THE TRUTH, ALL MY LIFE.

41:33.920 --> 41:37.287
AND IT'S TAKEN ITS TOLL
ON THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO ME.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.654
- MR. O'HARA, YES, SHAWN
HAS BENT THE TRUTH ON OCCASION,

41:41.700 --> 41:43.656
BUT HE'S AS DECENT
AS THEY COME.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.861
IN FACT, HE'S THE TYPE OF GUY

41:45.900 --> 41:47.993
I'D WANT MY DAUGHTER
TO BRING HOME...

41:48.030 --> 41:49.930
PROVIDED HE WAS MOSTLY BLACK...

41:49.970 --> 41:51.528
AND GOD-FEARING.
- OKAY.

41:51.570 --> 41:53.936
- AND SHE WASN'T REALLY
MY DAUGHTER.

41:53.970 --> 41:57.235
- I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT,
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

41:57.280 --> 41:58.975
I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT CALL.

41:59.010 --> 42:01.570
GUS, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PICKLE?
- YOU ATE IT ALREADY.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.975
- CAN'T PUT ANYTHING
OVER ON YOU!

42:04.020 --> 42:04.941
LOOK AT THE TIME.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.811
I GOT TO FLY.

42:07.850 --> 42:10.159
IF THE NSC CALLS
LOOKING FOR ME,

42:10.190 --> 42:12.078
TELL THEM I'VE DUMPED
MY CELL PHONE.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.825
- THAN KS, MAN.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.748
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.119
- HE STILL DIDN'T GIVE ME
HIS BLESSING.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.663
- AND HE TOOK THE PLATE I MADE
FROM COLOR ME MINE.

42:19.700 --> 42:20.667
THIS GUY...

42:20.700 --> 42:21.997
FRANK!
