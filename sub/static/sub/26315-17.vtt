--->   Skeebdo.com

00:15.359 --> 00:17.142
Look at you.

00:17.228 --> 00:19.895
You certainly are.

00:19.947 --> 00:22.414
On your way to being a lawyer.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.616
Do you need money?

00:25.156 --> 00:26.879
'Cause I don't have any.

00:26.904 --> 00:29.989
I just bought a Slurpee
with my Discover card.

00:30.570 --> 00:33.686
I was just thinking
how proud I am of you.

00:33.711 --> 00:36.495
- Aw.
- And what I could've done in my life

00:36.580 --> 00:37.796
if it weren't for my ADD.

00:37.882 --> 00:39.631
There it is!

00:39.717 --> 00:40.916
No, I mean it.

00:40.968 --> 00:43.218
I could've been a doctor. Or a lawyer.

00:43.254 --> 00:45.304
- Or a doctor-lawyer.
- Mm.

00:45.371 --> 00:47.714
A doctor just for lawyers.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.263
Without borders.

00:50.774 --> 00:53.241
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:53.266 --> 00:55.481
- How was your night?
- Fantastic.

00:55.506 --> 00:57.824
If only March Madness
were all year round.

00:58.269 --> 01:00.769
Then it would just be madness.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.049
Every basketball fan
in town called in sick

01:03.074 --> 01:05.190
to work and guzzled beer in my bar.

01:05.215 --> 01:07.693
- God bless them all.
- Yay, alcohol!

01:07.778 --> 01:09.945
You should start your
next share with that.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.570
Yeah, I started my
first share with that.

01:12.308 --> 01:13.749
And thank God for Tammy.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.816
She's not the best waitress,

01:14.841 --> 01:16.507
but she also doubles as a bouncer.

01:16.532 --> 01:19.699
She threw one guy out tonight,
and he literally bounced.

01:20.745 --> 01:22.519
Yo, Gus, how were the tips?

01:22.544 --> 01:25.160
Gus made $85.

01:25.421 --> 01:29.121
- Ha. Tammy made five times that.
- Seriously?

01:29.146 --> 01:31.863
Yeah. Hey, you want to pick
up some shifts this weekend?

01:31.888 --> 01:32.970
I-I could use the help.

01:33.457 --> 01:35.521
Yay, alcohol!

01:44.280 --> 01:45.913
Look at you.

01:45.938 --> 01:47.237
What?

01:47.262 --> 01:48.851
Running a successful bar.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.459
I'm so proud.

01:50.494 --> 01:52.044
Wait for it.

01:52.069 --> 01:54.903
Just think of the successful
business I could've run...

01:54.928 --> 01:57.345
If it weren't for my ADD.

01:58.699 --> 01:59.885
Wow.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.254
Well, you... You do
bring it up a lot, honey.

02:02.339 --> 02:05.691
- And then do nothing about it.
- Because I have ADD!

02:06.472 --> 02:09.344
There are therapists who
deal with this stuff for free.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.763
Wendy gave you that guy's number.

02:10.788 --> 02:12.348
Oh, so now I'm taking advice from Wendy?

02:12.483 --> 02:15.621
I should wear orange
Crocs and giant underwear?

02:15.902 --> 02:19.605
I am just saying, I realized
I had a gambling problem,

02:19.630 --> 02:21.066
I did something about it.

02:21.091 --> 02:23.308
Ooh. Cornered.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.304
So you guys are just gonna gang up on me

02:25.329 --> 02:26.578
until I go see someone?

02:26.844 --> 02:28.627
Seems like that's what's happening.

02:30.945 --> 02:32.895
Fine!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.703
I'll go to a therapist. You happy?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.338
For the first time in seven years,

02:36.373 --> 02:37.673
I might jump up and down.

02:50.363 --> 02:55.363

03:12.397 --> 03:15.365
Hope I'm walking into
the right fancy house.

03:17.444 --> 03:19.895
If not, I'm taking
this weird little tree.

03:26.052 --> 03:27.969
Hello?

03:29.915 --> 03:31.047
Therapist?

03:35.645 --> 03:38.334
"Please press button and have a seat."

03:45.097 --> 03:46.312
Fun.

04:05.678 --> 04:08.865
See you next week.

04:17.129 --> 04:19.529
That's the universe telling me to run.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.658
Bonnie Plunkett?

04:21.716 --> 04:23.076
Whatever you just said to that guy,

04:23.101 --> 04:24.184
don't say it to me.

04:24.269 --> 04:26.084
He was crying when he got here.

04:27.155 --> 04:28.916
I'm Trevor Wells. Why
don't you come on in.

04:28.940 --> 04:29.856
Not so fast.

04:29.941 --> 04:30.952
W-Wendy said this is free.

04:30.976 --> 04:32.170
You're not gonna get me in there

04:32.194 --> 04:33.727
and then sell me a bunch of vitamins?

04:33.872 --> 04:35.088
It really is free.

04:35.113 --> 04:36.529
Also, I don't believe in vitamins.

04:36.554 --> 04:39.803
And it's not just because I
have a reluctant swallow reflex.

04:41.139 --> 04:42.452
Did you make that up?

04:42.487 --> 04:43.703
No, it's a real thing.

04:43.789 --> 04:45.538
We have a very supportive
online community.

04:45.684 --> 04:46.933
Oh.

04:46.958 --> 04:48.408
I have no choice but to believe you,

04:48.433 --> 04:50.303
'cause I didn't have
time to hack your Wi-Fi.

04:50.803 --> 04:52.212
Well, you're welcome to try.

04:52.297 --> 04:54.192
I'll give you a thousand
dollars if you guess my password.

04:54.216 --> 04:55.498
Trevorheadshrink123.

04:57.455 --> 04:59.622
That's alarmingly close.

05:04.686 --> 05:06.536
Two IPAs, one Hefeweizen,

05:06.561 --> 05:08.762
three shots of silver
tequila and an iced tea.

05:08.787 --> 05:10.290
- And I need a beer.
- What kind?

05:10.315 --> 05:11.681
I don't know, cold?

05:12.905 --> 05:14.604
Tammy, the trick to doing this well

05:14.629 --> 05:16.329
is to take as many orders as you can,

05:16.354 --> 05:18.104
so you don't waste a
trip back to the bar.

05:18.158 --> 05:19.811
One is as many as I can.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.004
I'm so glad you're here.

05:24.029 --> 05:25.056
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.750
No. Thank you.

05:26.775 --> 05:28.475
I am making stripper-level tips,

05:28.500 --> 05:30.844
and the only thing showing is my elbows.

05:30.869 --> 05:32.013
Yeah, yeah, hey, uh, two light beers

05:32.037 --> 05:33.253
and a bourbon on the rocks...

05:33.278 --> 05:35.303
One at a time, I'm not a computer.

05:36.551 --> 05:39.686
Okay, iced tea for Mike,

05:39.711 --> 05:42.642
and shots and beers
for Mike's entourage.

05:42.667 --> 05:46.169
Entourage. I like that.
That doesn't mean I'm paying.

05:47.163 --> 05:49.990
What happened?

05:50.014 --> 05:52.014
That's the sound of people winning money.

05:52.067 --> 05:53.867
On what? The game isn't over yet.

05:53.892 --> 05:55.837
We all bet on Virginia to
make the next three-pointer,

05:55.861 --> 05:56.893
and they just hit it.

05:56.972 --> 05:58.922
Huh. No kidding.

05:58.974 --> 06:00.590
Which one of you guys is a bookie?

06:00.615 --> 06:02.031
None of us. No, we use an app

06:02.067 --> 06:03.544
where you can bet on
stuff during the game.

06:03.568 --> 06:05.169
Three-pointers, turnovers,

06:05.194 --> 06:07.047
which coach wears a toupee.

06:07.678 --> 06:09.883
So... theoretically,

06:09.908 --> 06:11.574
uh, you can do this on your phone

06:11.686 --> 06:13.651
in a dark closet with no one watching?

06:13.676 --> 06:15.059
Can and have.

06:15.964 --> 06:18.081
We live in an age of miracles.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.333
Ooh, you can bet on cricket?

06:22.715 --> 06:25.049
So you went to Australia, huh?

06:28.584 --> 06:30.370
If you throw this thing,
does it really come back?

06:31.824 --> 06:33.411
Why don't you give it a try?

06:33.436 --> 06:35.850
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

06:36.455 --> 06:38.421
Would you please sit back down?

07:01.428 --> 07:04.629
So, I guess you're
gonna leave it up to me.

07:06.186 --> 07:07.569
Okay.

07:07.662 --> 07:09.946
If I didn't have ADD, I
could've done your job.

07:10.043 --> 07:11.543
I could've helped people.

07:11.568 --> 07:14.397
Go ahead, uh, give me a
problem. How's your marriage?

07:14.760 --> 07:16.677
We're not here to talk about that.

07:16.702 --> 07:21.639
Ooh, I was just guessing,
but G3, sunk your battleship.

07:24.197 --> 07:25.928
How's that make you feel?

07:26.928 --> 07:29.978
Bonnie, I've treated a
number of adults with ADD.

07:30.003 --> 07:32.870
In my experience, there can
be a tremendous amount of shame

07:32.922 --> 07:35.123
and embarrassment attached to it.

07:36.108 --> 07:37.675
Yeah.

07:38.008 --> 07:39.733
It's a burden.

07:39.758 --> 07:42.347
I mean, I keep asking
myself what kind of mother

07:42.382 --> 07:44.410
I could've been, what kind
of partner I could've been...

07:44.434 --> 07:46.017
Is this suede?

07:48.358 --> 07:50.659
You know, I was gonna test you for ADD,

07:50.684 --> 07:52.300
but I think we can skip that.

07:54.110 --> 07:56.861
The important thing to remember
is that it's not your fault.

07:56.896 --> 07:58.529
Say more about that.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.772
Well, it's a neurological condition,

08:00.797 --> 08:03.100
and there are a variety
of ways to treat it.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.203
Uh, for instance, there's medication.

08:05.238 --> 08:07.038
No can do, I'm sober.

08:07.992 --> 08:10.124
I see some sober patients,

08:10.297 --> 08:11.713
and there are certain medications

08:11.738 --> 08:13.625
- that people in recovery can use...
- Okay,

08:13.650 --> 08:16.836
this is the exact opposite of
what I used to yell at doctors,

08:16.861 --> 08:18.945
but do not give me pills.

08:20.504 --> 08:23.976
If you tell me to take
one, I will take 120.

08:25.925 --> 08:27.425
Let's move on.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.762
There's cognitive behavioral therapy...

08:30.814 --> 08:31.896
Sexy name.

08:32.155 --> 08:35.817
It's a long-term
process of restructuring

08:35.842 --> 08:37.903
how you think about things,
so it changes your behavior.

08:37.928 --> 08:40.351
Yeah, you lost me at "long process."

08:41.658 --> 08:43.530
What do you got that's quick?

08:44.109 --> 08:47.359
Well, biofeedback has
been proven effective

08:47.384 --> 08:49.017
- in a shorter time frame.
- What's that?

08:49.342 --> 08:51.259
We wire your brain to a computer...

08:51.284 --> 08:54.023
Nope, I saw The Matrix,
that's how they get you.

09:05.268 --> 09:07.635
Do you believe that people
are trying to get you?

09:07.660 --> 09:09.744
You're either predator or prey, Trev.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.009
Would you mind sitting back down?

09:12.034 --> 09:14.001
I didn't even know I was up.

09:15.191 --> 09:17.656
That is just crazy.

09:17.681 --> 09:20.194
What about horses? Any therapy horses?

09:20.280 --> 09:22.730
You think if I had horses,
I wouldn't lead with that?

09:22.816 --> 09:24.399
So no horses?

09:24.424 --> 09:26.808
That really should go on your Yelp page.

09:27.726 --> 09:30.621
I'm sensing some resistance
to you treating your ADD.

09:30.646 --> 09:32.446
Is that what you're "sensing"?

09:35.545 --> 09:36.711
Okay.

09:36.796 --> 09:39.096
I have seen some patients

09:39.121 --> 09:41.557
that actually become
attached to their ADD,

09:42.135 --> 09:45.720
because they feel like it
gives them less responsibility

09:45.745 --> 09:47.065
for how their lives have turned out.

09:47.090 --> 09:48.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:48.365 --> 09:50.535
You're saying I like having this curse?

09:50.560 --> 09:53.511
Well, I said it much
more eloquently, but yes.

09:54.018 --> 09:56.207
Well, your lousy marriage has obviously

09:56.232 --> 09:57.398
got you off your game.

09:57.484 --> 09:58.850
Good day, sir.

10:00.424 --> 10:02.417
Best thing about this
place is this button.

10:02.442 --> 10:03.909
Session is over.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.651
Or is it? It is!

10:10.725 --> 10:12.525
What a nut.

10:16.237 --> 10:17.752
These people are drinking so much,

10:17.777 --> 10:19.408
and they all want different things!

10:19.433 --> 10:20.849
Tammy, breathe.

10:20.874 --> 10:22.737
It's bad, we're never
getting out from under this.

10:22.762 --> 10:25.230
- Hey, remember your training.
- I've had no training.

10:25.545 --> 10:28.179
Hey, I'm backed up here, too.
Where the hell is Christy?

10:28.214 --> 10:29.182
Oh, she's over there with the guy

10:29.207 --> 10:31.074
who ordered either
the bourbon or a pizza.

10:31.099 --> 10:32.565
I don't know!

10:32.713 --> 10:34.212
We don't sell pizza.

10:34.437 --> 10:36.020
And I'm just learning this now?

10:36.055 --> 10:38.565
I've made pepperoni promises.

10:39.452 --> 10:42.003
Boom, count it!

10:42.028 --> 10:44.228
Yeah! That's three in a
row. You're our lucky charm.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.481
Oh. Kentucky is shooting free throws.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.533
Christy, is he gonna make both?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.346
He's a freshman, it's a big moment.

10:51.371 --> 10:53.287
I'm going with no.

10:53.373 --> 10:55.120
Oh, here we go.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.542
Sinks the first one.

10:57.577 --> 10:58.659
It's okay, it's okay.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.412
It's not okay. I bet $300.

11:01.464 --> 11:03.581
It's a brick!

11:03.633 --> 11:05.500
It's a brick!

11:05.585 --> 11:07.802
- Ha.
- Sorry I spoke sternly.

11:07.827 --> 11:09.911
You were under a lot of pressure, Mike.

11:11.284 --> 11:13.284
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

11:13.309 --> 11:15.843
Stop, I-I can't take
this. I can't gamble.

11:15.868 --> 11:18.072
Oh, this isn't gambling,
it's just a tip.

11:18.097 --> 11:21.182
If you were gambling, you
would've got ten times this.

11:21.277 --> 11:23.578
- I would've?
- Behind you.

11:23.603 --> 11:26.437
Behind you. Make a hole, people!

11:26.462 --> 11:27.661
I'm going down.

11:36.566 --> 11:38.683
Oh, my God, what's going on?

11:38.769 --> 11:42.353
Welcome to March Madness
in Gamblers Anonymous.

11:42.378 --> 11:44.445
Christy, saved you a seat.

11:44.574 --> 11:47.108
Thanks. This is crazy.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.440
Yeah, lot of people bottom out in March.

11:49.465 --> 11:52.030
Ugh. In AA, it's New Year's.

11:52.055 --> 11:54.964
In my sex addiction
group, it's Easter Sunday.

11:55.335 --> 11:58.002
No one's quite figured out why.

11:58.846 --> 12:01.417
- So, how you doing?
- Good.

12:03.214 --> 12:06.604
Hey, are you aware of these new
live betting apps on your phone?

12:06.629 --> 12:07.745
Oh, yeah.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.608
- I'm not, what are they?
- Hmm.

12:09.633 --> 12:12.634
Fastest way to wind up living
in your car again, Lucy.

12:13.061 --> 12:16.760
I lost my car last
month. Stupid Super Bowl.

12:18.318 --> 12:20.743
So I was cocktail
waitressing and these guys

12:20.768 --> 12:25.263
were making live bets and they
may have solicited my opinion

12:25.288 --> 12:27.238
on a few scenarios.

12:28.094 --> 12:29.294
And I killed it.

12:29.319 --> 12:31.035
I ended up with 600 bucks.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.848
- Gambling?
- Well, they gambled,

12:32.873 --> 12:34.456
and then they tipped me when they won.

12:34.551 --> 12:36.968
So I didn't gamble, right?

12:36.993 --> 12:39.315
Please say yes, please say yes.

12:39.456 --> 12:42.664
No, you didn't gamble,
but you came awfully close.

12:42.909 --> 12:45.944
I know. It's just, I
don't want to quit the bar.

12:45.969 --> 12:49.838
I'm making great money and I'm
helping out my mom's fiancé.

12:49.917 --> 12:51.533
Okay, let's make a plan.

12:51.558 --> 12:53.645
You call me at the
beginning of your shift,

12:53.670 --> 12:55.871
on your break and at
the end of your shift.

12:55.896 --> 12:58.667
I love that plan. And
I can keep my winnings.

12:58.692 --> 13:01.326
Tips. Tips... They're tips.

13:01.351 --> 13:03.351
Lucy, what's on your phone?

13:03.863 --> 13:05.813
Porn.

13:06.958 --> 13:08.874
Lucy.

13:12.854 --> 13:15.003
You'll get it back in April.

13:15.267 --> 13:16.850
He knows me.

13:19.586 --> 13:21.640
All right, I know it's been rough.

13:22.999 --> 13:25.507
Tammy sacrificed her body for the team.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.175
Christy got pretty dehydrated.

13:27.210 --> 13:29.952
Somebody stepped on Gus's paw.

13:30.764 --> 13:33.357
So today, you got to keep
pounding those fluids.

13:33.382 --> 13:34.693
Don't be bashful.

13:34.718 --> 13:36.684
We got 12 hours of games ahead of us.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.640
Oh, my God.

13:39.222 --> 13:40.605
You got this.

13:40.717 --> 13:42.250
If we die, we die together.

13:42.275 --> 13:44.865
You can get it done,
you can get it done.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.312
And what's more, you got to get it done.

13:47.397 --> 13:48.813
All right, bring it in.

13:48.899 --> 13:50.648
"Barrelworks" on three. One, two, three.

13:50.734 --> 13:52.283
Barrelworks!

13:55.019 --> 13:58.367
Okay, somebody open the
doors, let the madness begin.

14:00.388 --> 14:02.721
I bet you're pretty surprised to see me.

14:02.746 --> 14:05.413
Well, you did call for an appointment.

14:06.330 --> 14:08.497
I bet that surprised you.

14:09.302 --> 14:10.867
Sure.

14:12.007 --> 14:13.565
I just thought I'd prove to you

14:13.590 --> 14:15.545
that I'm not clinging to my condition.

14:15.570 --> 14:17.964
Bonnie, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

14:17.989 --> 14:19.571
I'm pretty much a stranger.

14:19.596 --> 14:21.346
Disappointing. I was
hoping this would be

14:21.371 --> 14:23.531
a little more adversarial.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.890
Give it time.

14:27.140 --> 14:31.082
All right, so start doing your thing.

14:31.107 --> 14:33.531
How do you know I
haven't started already?

14:34.277 --> 14:36.861
Touché.

14:36.947 --> 14:39.664
Welcome to the game.

14:43.088 --> 14:45.954
We got hot wings, fiery hot wings

14:46.006 --> 14:49.340
and for Mike, Burn My
Ass Like Napalm wings.

14:49.365 --> 14:52.115
Otherwise known as the
poor man's colonoscopy.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.012
- Enjoy.
- Oh, don't go.

14:54.097 --> 14:56.636
I'm on a cold streak
here, I-I need the magic.

14:56.661 --> 14:58.577
Who do you like to make the next basket?

14:59.080 --> 15:01.246
Okay, that was fun yesterday, guys,

15:01.271 --> 15:03.021
but, uh, I got a lot of work to do.

15:03.106 --> 15:05.523
Oh, come on, Christy.
My kids need shoes.

15:05.669 --> 15:06.918
You don't have kids.

15:06.943 --> 15:08.059
Okay, I need shoes.

15:08.292 --> 15:10.416
Fine, but only one.

15:11.815 --> 15:15.149
- Cincinnati.
- Oh... you heard the lady. Cincinnati.

15:15.357 --> 15:17.691
Check it out, Christy,
I'm getting it done.

15:20.730 --> 15:22.434
And boom goes the dynamite.

15:22.459 --> 15:24.626
- Way to go, Christy.
- Ooh, ooh!

15:24.661 --> 15:25.972
We're coming up on the end of the half.

15:25.996 --> 15:27.545
Is it gonna be an odd or even score?

15:28.236 --> 15:31.370
I'm sorry, you guys.
I-I got to walk away now.

15:31.395 --> 15:34.446
Hi, how we doing here?
Anybody need more... screw it.

15:34.471 --> 15:37.343
Put 20 on odd, 40 on Auburn
to cover the first half spread

15:37.368 --> 15:39.284
and show me the odds on
the North Carolina game.

15:39.309 --> 15:40.642
Faster.

15:43.033 --> 15:46.147
So to recap, your
Bonnie bullet points are:

15:46.439 --> 15:49.160
abandoned as a little kid,
kicked out of 12 foster homes...

15:49.185 --> 15:50.986
Never my fault.

15:54.157 --> 15:57.275
On my own by 16, full-blown
addict and criminal by 18,

15:57.360 --> 16:00.695
sober at 50 and hopefully
by 60, doctor-lawyer.

16:03.393 --> 16:04.893
You know, it sounds like your ADD

16:04.918 --> 16:06.584
actually served you quite well.

16:06.915 --> 16:08.313
What are you talking about?

16:08.579 --> 16:11.349
Your childhood was a
nightmare, and your ability

16:11.374 --> 16:14.032
to check out from that
might have saved your life.

16:15.493 --> 16:18.513
So I should be grateful
that I've got ADD?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.716
It may have been a very
helpful coping mechanism.

16:21.877 --> 16:25.328
It allowed your brain to avoid
some pretty terrible feelings.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.368
Huh.

16:29.452 --> 16:31.202
But you're in a safe place,

16:31.227 --> 16:34.312
so you can allow those feelings
to come up and be healed.

16:36.586 --> 16:38.017
Okay.

16:38.735 --> 16:39.879
So what are you feeling, Bonnie?

16:39.903 --> 16:42.016
I feel pretty pissed off, Trevor.

16:43.376 --> 16:44.675
And you have every right to be.

16:44.700 --> 16:45.884
- I do?
- Yes.

16:45.909 --> 16:48.376
Your life was heartbreaking.

16:49.523 --> 16:50.889
Uh-huh.

16:50.914 --> 16:52.391
If I were you, I'd feel pretty enraged

16:52.415 --> 16:53.581
at what had happened to me.

16:53.606 --> 16:54.722
Yeah.

16:54.801 --> 16:56.384
The trauma of your childhood

16:56.419 --> 16:59.303
informed every moment
of your life since then.

16:59.328 --> 17:01.611
Oh, my God.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.070
Oh, my God...

17:07.026 --> 17:10.281
I'll see you next week.

17:16.271 --> 17:20.691
Don't let this
discourage you in any way.

17:25.070 --> 17:26.914
Hey, Christy, come on!

17:26.950 --> 17:28.870
I got a dozen drinks
here that need to go out!

17:28.895 --> 17:30.061
Tammy's got it.

17:30.086 --> 17:32.453
It's true. I'm unstoppable.

17:32.505 --> 17:35.006
Hey, if you see your drink, take it.

17:35.091 --> 17:36.874
Come on, come on, come on.

17:39.295 --> 17:41.262
- Ah, we did it! Yeah!
- What?!

17:41.297 --> 17:43.681
Yeah! Yeah! Ah! Yeah...

17:43.767 --> 17:45.433
Hello.

17:45.725 --> 17:48.192
Ugh.

17:50.234 --> 17:51.950
Okay, I was gonna call.

17:51.975 --> 17:53.357
But you didn't.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.359
Well, I-I was busy.

17:55.445 --> 17:56.944
And I was just having fun.

17:56.969 --> 17:58.685
Yeah, you were having fun.

17:58.782 --> 18:00.114
'Cause you were gambling.

18:00.150 --> 18:01.699
Here's what I think happened.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.962
I didn't care about the gambling.

18:03.987 --> 18:05.991
It was about the camaraderie,

18:06.016 --> 18:08.349
everybody rooting for the same team.

18:08.374 --> 18:10.041
I don't have that in my life.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.971
In law school, everybody's
rooting for me to fail.

18:13.171 --> 18:15.137
I didn't even care if I won money.

18:15.162 --> 18:20.298
I just, I wanted to be a part
of something bigger than myself.

18:21.221 --> 18:22.524
Wow.

18:23.223 --> 18:24.267
Yeah.

18:24.724 --> 18:26.891
What a load of crap.

18:27.438 --> 18:30.582
Geez. In AA, we're nice to each other.

18:30.607 --> 18:33.648
Yeah, and in AA, you get camaraderie.

18:33.683 --> 18:36.138
You got it in GA, too.

18:36.357 --> 18:38.881
But don't be telling me you're
doing this to be a part of something.

18:38.905 --> 18:41.823
You're doing this
because you're an addict.

18:41.943 --> 18:44.410
And in this case, the
drug is adrenaline.

18:46.581 --> 18:48.164
So you think I slipped?

18:48.189 --> 18:49.739
I do.

18:49.970 --> 18:51.646
Yeah, me, too.

18:53.253 --> 18:55.419
I'm so pathetic.

18:55.505 --> 18:57.004
I'm never gonna get this.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.874
Oh, so you go right to the pity party?

18:59.926 --> 19:02.927
Again, no need to be mean.

19:02.952 --> 19:05.250
Look, you've been
slinging cocktails in there

19:05.275 --> 19:07.525
night after night. Now,
were you ever once tempted

19:07.550 --> 19:09.467
- to take a drink?
- No.

19:09.552 --> 19:11.886
Okay. And that's because
you've been sober for how long?

19:11.965 --> 19:12.848
Five years.

19:12.873 --> 19:14.582
And how long you been
trying to quit gambling?

19:14.607 --> 19:15.890
Five minutes.

19:15.952 --> 19:17.869
You're a newcomer.

19:18.162 --> 19:22.363
It'll get easier, one day at a time.

19:22.398 --> 19:25.816
The rule is you do not
gamble, no matter what.

19:26.060 --> 19:28.193
All these rules.

19:28.227 --> 19:30.694
It's really just the one.

19:31.974 --> 19:33.852
So can I let you go
back in there to work

19:33.877 --> 19:35.459
or do I need to take you home?

19:38.214 --> 19:40.131
I'll be okay.

19:40.216 --> 19:41.883
My gambling buddies will be pissed,

19:41.918 --> 19:45.169
- Mm.
- But I'll be okay.

19:45.316 --> 19:48.900
Hey, if you're hungry, we
serve great chicken wings.

19:48.925 --> 19:51.142
Yeah, I'm 64 years old

19:51.167 --> 19:53.978
and there isn't enough
Prilosec in the world.

19:54.430 --> 19:55.763
I will have a beer, though.

19:55.815 --> 19:57.565
- Show-off.
- Yeah.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.983
Nothing's fair.

20:01.572 --> 20:04.288
I'm seeing what you do
in a whole new light now.

20:04.321 --> 20:05.987
I'll treasure that.

20:08.595 --> 20:10.128
So now that you like the therapist

20:10.180 --> 20:12.230
I recommended, are you
gonna be nice to me?

20:12.255 --> 20:14.712
He's a therapist, not a gallon of gin.

20:16.017 --> 20:18.663
I'm just hoping we don't
have to listen to you complain

20:18.688 --> 20:19.993
about your ADD anymore.

20:20.018 --> 20:21.845
No, 'cause it saved my life.

20:21.870 --> 20:25.001
What you're not gonna see me
do anymore is edit my anger.

20:26.548 --> 20:28.646
Is that something you do?

20:28.698 --> 20:31.065
I don't know, I'm finding my way.

20:31.151 --> 20:32.817
But I've been told by a professional

20:32.842 --> 20:35.209
that I have every right to be angry.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.204
Oh, goodie.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.958
Let's hope the therapy helps
you deal with that anger

20:39.993 --> 20:41.576
in a healthy way.

20:41.601 --> 20:43.618
No promises, Marge.
