WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:05.636
You wanted to see me?

00:05.772 --> 00:07.672
Yes, I did.

00:07.807 --> 00:09.934
This is a $54 steak.

00:10.076 --> 00:12.340
Congratulations.
It looks really good.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.343
Yes, it does.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.607
But, of course, I can't eat it
because of my recent...

00:15.749 --> 00:16.773
Heart attack.

00:16.916 --> 00:18.042
Secret heart attack.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.881
No strenuous activity,
no red meat, no booze.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.115
But I thought perhaps
you might enjoy it.

00:24.257 --> 00:26.316
Oh, okay. Thanks.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.120
This'll make
a great sandwich tomorrow.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.161
No. I would like you
to eat it here.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.957
Right now.

00:32.098 --> 00:37.297
You want to watch me
eat this steak in front of you?

00:37.437 --> 00:39.735
That's what I want.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.138
Okay.

00:42.275 --> 00:45.210
This is a time of new beginnings
for me, Lemon.

00:45.345 --> 00:50.009
And, of course, that means
new opportunities.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.777
Have you read the interview
with Don Geiss

00:51.918 --> 00:53.943
in this month's issue
of "Yachting Illustrated"?

00:54.087 --> 00:56.920
No. I subscribe
to "Giant Boats. "

00:57.057 --> 01:00.549
"'The ocean,' says Geiss,
'like business

01:00.693 --> 01:02.684
or the pillowy abyss
of a lover's bosom,

01:02.829 --> 01:04.126
seems infinite.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.198
But all things must end. "'

01:06.332 --> 01:07.822
"Pillowy abyss"?

01:07.967 --> 01:09.161
Ignore that part.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.361
"All things must end. "

01:11.504 --> 01:13.665
Geiss is sending signals
about retirement,

01:13.807 --> 01:14.671
about succession.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.504
By talking about sex
in a sailing magazine?

01:17.644 --> 01:19.202
That's exactly
how Margaret Thatcher did it.

01:19.345 --> 01:22.940
Geiss' job is the most coveted
position in the free world.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.675
You're in the running for it,
right?

01:24.818 --> 01:26.979
I would like to think so.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.452
But I've got to do something
to raise my profile,

01:29.589 --> 01:32.456
to distinguish me
in some way.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.718
And I have to do it soo...

01:33.860 --> 01:36.124
You ate that whole thing?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.856
A dog took it.

01:38.998 --> 01:41.159
He came out of nowhere.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:00.420 --> 02:02.081
Hey, Jenna.
What's up?

02:02.222 --> 02:03.450
Pretty good.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.614
Are you okay?

02:04.757 --> 02:06.725
I'm fine, Jenna.
I'm just a little light-headed.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.556
I'm on a crash diet to get back
to my old weight by Friday.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.026
What diet is gonna do that?

02:11.164 --> 02:12.927
It's the
Japanese Porn Star Diet.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.397
I only eat paper.

02:14.534 --> 02:17.332
But I can eat all the paper
I want, so...

02:17.470 --> 02:18.528
Hey, there.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.730
Hi.

02:20.874 --> 02:24.139
Jenna,
this isn't healthy.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.745
Maybe you're just fighting
your natural shape.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.541
When did your mom gain
all that weight?

02:28.681 --> 02:30.512
Oh, God!

02:30.650 --> 02:33.448
My point is, don't let people
make you crazy about this.

02:33.586 --> 02:36.487
You are just as beautiful
and talented as you ever were.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.319
No. No, no, no.
You are fat.

02:39.459 --> 02:42.986
Go and see Dr. Spaceman right
now and get this taken care of.

02:44.264 --> 02:47.062
How come men can be heavy
and be respected?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.725
Like James Gandolfini
or Fat Albert?

02:49.869 --> 02:51.029
It's a double standard,

02:51.171 --> 02:54.368
and America needs to get over
its body-image madness.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.769
Oh, come on.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.467
What are we, back in college,
freshman year?

02:57.610 --> 02:59.703
Let's go to the common room
and talk about apartheid.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.679
I'm sorry if I care about making
the world a better place.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.077
You should be.
It's a complete waste of time,

03:04.217 --> 03:06.879
and it prevents you
from dealing with this.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.353
Excuse me. What about "this"
do I have to deal with?

03:10.490 --> 03:11.457
How's your love life going?

03:11.591 --> 03:14.583
I believe that love comes to you
when you're not looking for it.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.217
Did you return that
wedding dress you bought?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.058
I'm gonna sell it online,
but my Internet is being weird.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.530
How about the furniture
for your "home office"?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.601
Have you even
set that up yet?

03:25.672 --> 03:29.233
I'm not making excuses, Jack.
But "this" is taken care of.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.239
Ow.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.900
Ah, nerds!

03:32.045 --> 03:34.138
I missed a dentist appointment
this morning.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.907
<i>Josh to the stage, please,</i>

03:36.049 --> 03:37.710
<i>for "llleana Douglas
Talk Show. "</i>

03:37.850 --> 03:39.078
Son of a bitch.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.811
Banks.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.080
What are you doing in town?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.918
Were you drawn to the phallic
nature of our skyline?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.083
Very funny, Jack.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.058
How gay is this?

03:49.195 --> 03:51.129
I'm here visiting
my fiancÃ©e.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.822
What?

03:52.966 --> 03:53.830
Kathy...

03:53.967 --> 03:56.902
this is Jack Donaghy.

03:57.036 --> 03:58.628
Banks,
have you lost your mind?

03:58.771 --> 04:02.832
Oh, did I forget to mention
that Kathy is Kathy Geiss?

04:02.976 --> 04:05.672
As in Don Geiss' daughter.

04:07.113 --> 04:09.911
Can you believe that Don thought
she'd never get married?

04:10.817 --> 04:13.012
You can't.
You're gay.

04:13.152 --> 04:14.710
No.
Not anymore, friend.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.754
Are you familiar
with the Church of Practicology?

04:16.889 --> 04:18.857
You mean the cult that
was invented by Stan Lee?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.721
No,
I mean the religion founded

04:20.860 --> 04:23.294
by the alien king
living inside Stan Lee.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.590
You see, it's my faith
in Practicology

04:25.732 --> 04:29.327
that has helped me uncover
my true straight self.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.470
It's definitely working.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.301
I can totally feel the gay
draining right out of me.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.137
By the eye of Zolnak,
right, guys?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.644
You're going to be
Don Geiss' son-in-law?

04:40.780 --> 04:41.974
That's right.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.844
And if you read
his recent interview

04:43.983 --> 04:45.473
in the "Harvard
Gay Business Review,"

04:45.618 --> 04:47.984
you know that he's thinking
about retirement.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.887
But I guess I'll find out more
about that tonight at dinner.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.957
With Geiss.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.653
At a restaurant.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.206
<i>Josh to the stage, please.</i>

05:09.342 --> 05:11.105
Yo, Ken.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.644
Angie and Grizz is coming by
to drop some of my stuff off.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.804
Oh. Okay.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.609
But I want her to know I'm
having a good time on my own,

05:17.750 --> 05:19.240
so you should go get us
some party hats.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.046
The pointy kind.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.678
Mr. Jordan,
can't you just apologize to her?

05:23.823 --> 05:26.223
No! Things have been said
that cannot be taken back.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.419
She called my vanity
license plate inscrutable!

05:30.963 --> 05:33.090
"I see you ate one.
Am I"?

05:33.232 --> 05:34.597
Hilarious!

05:34.734 --> 05:36.702
Angie is in the past,

05:36.836 --> 05:38.861
like Dracula
and broadcast television.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.997
I think you're letting
your pride get in the way.

05:42.141 --> 05:44.006
I mean, if you saw Angie
with another man...

05:44.143 --> 05:45.007
With who?

05:45.144 --> 05:46.805
That guy Mike
that redid our driveway?

05:48.047 --> 05:50.345
Nah, whatever.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.849
She should find
someone new.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.612
Doesn't bother me.

05:57.390 --> 05:58.789
Dot Com, I have an idea.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.722
Well, I don't know,
but it's worth a shot.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.124
Are you even listening
to me?

06:03.262 --> 06:06.754
Now, Jenna, medically speaking,
for your height,

06:06.899 --> 06:10.357
your weight puts you in what
we call the disgusting range.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.336
Fortunately,
there are solutions.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.931
For example, crystal meth has
been shown to be very effective.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.437
How important
is tooth retention to you?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.775
It's pretty important.

06:22.915 --> 06:23.882
Okay.

06:24.016 --> 06:27.543
What about my crazy surgical
options, Dr. Spaceman?

06:27.687 --> 06:28.881
Please.

06:29.021 --> 06:32.457
"Dr. Spaceman" is my dad.
Call me Leo.

06:32.592 --> 06:36.289
And there are some wonderful
crazy surgical options.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.990
Are you familiar
with the Bradshaw Clinic?

06:40.133 --> 06:43.899
Am I? That's where
the Olsen twins were separated.

06:44.036 --> 06:46.630
I've sent a number
of my famous clients there.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.298
I can make a call,
get you in as soon as possible.

06:49.442 --> 06:52.240
Oh, thank you, Leo.

06:52.378 --> 06:55.575
I can't be on television
looking like I just had a baby.

06:55.715 --> 07:00.015
This, right here,
is why I got into medicine.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.011
Devin's a genius.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.818
A genius? Isn't he just living
a lie to get ahead at work?

07:05.958 --> 07:07.186
We all have our secrets.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.953
Devin's pretending
to be straight.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.722
I'm trying to keep
my heart episode under wraps.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.160
And Alan Garkel
in legal?

07:12.298 --> 07:13.629
I don't think he needs
that wheelchair.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.290
No!

07:24.243 --> 07:27.269
Aah!
Uh, Mr. Banks.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.380
I didn't see you there.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.312
I've been following you for the
better part of an hour, Kenneth.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.385
Does Mr. Donaghy know
you're here?

07:33.519 --> 07:36.352
I don't need Jack's permission,
Kenneth.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.150
I'm gonna be running this place
soon.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.691
And there are gonna be
some changes

07:40.827 --> 07:44.194
to the pages' uniforms,
certainly.

07:44.330 --> 07:47.026
Mr. Banks, Mr. Donaghy
eats guys like you

07:47.166 --> 07:48.360
as part of
a healthy breakfast.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.163
And I'm sure you think
he's weak right now,

07:51.304 --> 07:53.864
but he's only gotten stronger
since his heart attack.

07:55.374 --> 07:57.205
Heart attack?
Really?

07:57.343 --> 07:59.106
Right, Mr. D?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.269
High five!

08:01.047 --> 08:04.016
Not now? Okay.

08:07.286 --> 08:09.151
What is this?
Liposuction?

08:09.288 --> 08:11.188
Plus bone shaving
and organ reduction.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.188
Ugh!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.917
Liz, you don't understand.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.085
People look at me differently
now.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.323
Jack, the writers,
the manager at Forever 21.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.899
That is their problem,
not yours.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.661
Is this clinic on a boat?

08:23.803 --> 08:26.829
Hey, I've got a character
for Jenna called "Me Want Food. "

08:26.973 --> 08:31.034
She's in a supermarket, and
she keeps going, "Me want food!"

08:31.177 --> 08:32.405
What? No.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.240
We are not treating Jenna
any differently.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.745
She's gonna play all the
characters she usually plays.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.712
Like Hillary Clinton.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.317
That's awesome.
"Fat Hillary. "

08:39.452 --> 08:41.249
She can be like,
"Me want food!"

08:41.386 --> 08:44.015
No one is saying,
"Me want food," Frank.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.624
We are going to showcase
Jenna's talents.

08:46.759 --> 08:47.919
Can I sing a song
on the show?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.220
Yes.
That's a great idea.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.057
Can I sing and rollerdance?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.858
Yes.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.399
Yeah, because we are going to
dare America

08:55.535 --> 08:57.594
to change their own attitudes
about body image.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.069
Why do you have to make
everything into an issue?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.798
Don't you have things to do
in your own life?

09:01.941 --> 09:03.568
At least I don't live
with my mom. Ow!

09:03.709 --> 09:04.573
Hey, my mom's cool.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.940
I've got my life together,
okay?

09:07.613 --> 09:09.911
Holy crap!
Did your tooth just fall out?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.607
That's not great, huh?

09:12.752 --> 09:14.720
Oh, check this out.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.914
My key to the city
of Gary, Indiana.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.922
Mm! Look at this.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.119
My gold record
from that novelty party song.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.957
<i>Werewolf bar mitzvah?</i>

09:25.097 --> 09:26.758
<i>Spooky, scary?</i>

09:26.899 --> 09:28.594
<i>Boys becoming men?</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:30.258
<i>Men becoming wolves?</i>

09:30.403 --> 09:32.268
Well, I'm going now.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.169
Is there anything else
you want to say, Tracy?

09:35.308 --> 09:36.240
Yeah.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.036
I miss you, Grizz.

09:39.512 --> 09:40.774
Ugh!

09:43.282 --> 09:45.273
Hello, Angie.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.909
I hear you're single now.
That's cool.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.521
What?

09:49.655 --> 09:53.216
I like your top.
I'm a real good sex person.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.951
I do it
all the different ways.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.755
Uh-huh.

09:56.896 --> 10:00.093
Well, I don't have a husband
anymore.

10:00.232 --> 10:03.133
So you can come over
anytime.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.670
Oh, I will.
I'll come over at night.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.572
Good job, Kenneth.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.775
You should see my A-game.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.519
So, Dad...

10:27.660 --> 10:29.355
Can I call you "Dad"?

10:29.495 --> 10:32.396
Why not? I have a grandkid
who calls me "Don. "

10:32.531 --> 10:33.896
Next time he does it,

10:34.033 --> 10:36.831
I'm marching that little bastard
to a recruiting station.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.460
Great story, Dad!

10:39.605 --> 10:41.368
Don! Devin!

10:41.507 --> 10:44.499
Jack! Small world.
Join us.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.168
Are you sure?
I wouldn't want to intrude.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.472
This is Manal.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.673
I never should have said
we were going to a restaurant.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.450
She got big.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.727
Ooh, her center of gravity
is a little different.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.699
Me want food!

11:20.312 --> 11:22.974
Did you happen to tell Geiss
about my little episode?

11:23.115 --> 11:26.710
Come on, Jack.
I'd never rat you out.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.911
Wouldn't want to let you off
that easy.

11:29.055 --> 11:29.919
Here.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.581
Why don't you take
some of my steak?

11:32.725 --> 11:34.215
I could never eat
this much meat.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.419
That's not what I hear.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.189
Jack, we're having
a little get-together

11:38.330 --> 11:39.888
up at the house on Saturday.

11:40.032 --> 11:40.964
You should come.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.126
That would be my pleasure,
sir.

11:44.937 --> 11:45.904
Yeah, you should come.

11:46.038 --> 11:50.099
It's gonna be a whole day
of team sports and beer.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.301
Get the ol' heart rate up.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.504
Maybe pound a cheeseburger
in the sun.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.081
Throw some butter on it.
You're gonna love it.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.949
I'm gonna make your heart
explode.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.187
Hey, Ken.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.729
You're up early,
Mr. Jordan.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.425
I only got 11 or 12 hours sleep
last night.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.160
I got something
on my mind-grapes

12:17.303 --> 12:18.361
I need to talk to you about.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.438
Oh.
What is it, sir?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.734
I saw you hitting on Angie
the other day.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.810
Seeing you with her,
it opened my eyes.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.310
Good for you, sir.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.880
Yeah. All those years
fooling around,

12:30.015 --> 12:31.983
it wasn't fair to her.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.381
So you got to make it fair.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.251
I want you to go to my house
and make love to my wife, Ken.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.982
Jiminy Christmas!

12:40.126 --> 12:42.594
My home address is in the GPS
under "DaCrib"

12:42.728 --> 12:44.423
'cause we live
on DaCrib Avenue.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.554
Now, you go to Angie.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.099
And you make sure
you pleasure her.

12:52.538 --> 12:53.698
Well, they did laugh.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.534
<i>At you, Jenna. At.</i>

12:55.674 --> 12:57.198
Right.
The bad kind.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.607
You just can't be a real woman
in this country.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.714
God! It's like those Dove
commercials never even happened.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.840
Hey! Oh!
"Me want food"!

13:05.985 --> 13:08.954
This woman was a Mouseketeer,
ma'am.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.453
Let it go, Liz.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.523
<i>Me want food!</i>

13:15.895 --> 13:16.862
Oh, my God.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.588
My own T-shirt!

13:18.731 --> 13:20.995
Hey!
I am wanting the foods!

13:21.133 --> 13:22.657
Very good. Very nice.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.268
Thataboy!

13:29.408 --> 13:30.534
Yes!

13:30.676 --> 13:31.836
Thanks, Jack!

13:31.977 --> 13:34.002
You earned me a grand!

13:34.146 --> 13:36.637
Thank you.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.884
How's the heart holding up,
buddy?

13:41.020 --> 13:43.045
You know,
you ought to just quit.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.156
Geiss loves quitters,

13:44.290 --> 13:46.383
if I understood
his autobiography correctly.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.015
Oh, wait.
I didn't.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.152
You know what?
It's all right, Jack.

13:51.297 --> 13:54.095
When you're dead
and I'm CEO...

13:54.233 --> 13:55.825
Oh, my.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.667
Winthrop!

14:01.807 --> 14:03.035
How do you do it, man?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.369
You're always in
such great shape.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.205
Same weight as when I wrestled
at Yale, Jack.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.142
Winthrop here wrestled
at Yale.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.577
With other dudes or...

14:09.715 --> 14:11.478
Banks here
says he can pin you.

14:11.617 --> 14:12.709
Well, I don't know...

14:12.852 --> 14:16.185
Okay.
You're so strong.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.483
Oh, God.
You're having your way with me.

14:18.624 --> 14:21.149
Your back is like a barrel
of snakes.

14:21.293 --> 14:22.920
Oh, God!
I'm just your doll.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.893
I think I love you.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.497
We're joking.
It's all jokes.

14:26.632 --> 14:31.160
This is
no ordinary love?

14:31.303 --> 14:32.668
What have I done?

14:32.805 --> 14:34.466
Kenneth
should be back by now.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.598
What's going on
over at my house?

14:38.143 --> 14:43.604
<i>This is no ordinary love?</i>

14:43.749 --> 14:47.685
<i>No ordinary love?</i>

15:01.133 --> 15:02.065
No!

15:02.201 --> 15:03.725
No!

15:03.869 --> 15:06.497
I got to stop this!

15:15.347 --> 15:17.110
Wow.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.443
There she is.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.314
Me Want Food.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.819
Did you know,
scientifically speaking,

15:23.956 --> 15:26.424
that humans want food
but don't need it?

15:26.558 --> 15:29.584
I'm really having second
thoughts about all of this.

15:29.728 --> 15:34.324
Oh, don't worry.
Dr. Wally is the best there is.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.627
In a few hours, you'll be
back to your old self.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.136
It'll be like none of this
ever happened.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.610
I'm keeping it!

15:49.748 --> 15:51.238
Uh, what?

15:51.383 --> 15:53.749
The fat.
I've decided to keep it.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.583
Because people recognize me
and I get off on it.

15:57.723 --> 15:58.690
If you're gonna do this,

15:58.824 --> 16:02.157
it's got to be because we are
proving a point to the world.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.592
Ugh! I'm not trying to prove
anything.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.460
And you've got to stop telling
people how to run their lives.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.089
That's not what this is.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.599
And it's kind of hard
to take life advice

16:10.736 --> 16:13.034
from a single woman
who is using her treadmill

16:13.172 --> 16:14.935
as a hanger
for a wedding dress.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.598
Oh, I'm supposed
to put it in the closet

16:16.742 --> 16:17.936
with ham fat all over it?

16:18.077 --> 16:21.137
And who's wearing a one-piece
swimsuit instead of underwear.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.043
I have to do laundry.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.483
There he is!

16:32.624 --> 16:35.218
Hey, Jack.
Want a hot dog?

16:35.361 --> 16:36.555
Oh, right.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.162
The sodium.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.457
Bum-bum.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.656
Bum-bum.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.198
Ka-boom!

16:44.670 --> 16:48.470
Just so you know, if you hear
this sound at your funeral,

16:48.607 --> 16:49.665
it's just me laughing.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.519
I can't hear you, Banks.

17:07.659 --> 17:10.093
Are you saying
you want me to help you?

17:10.229 --> 17:12.094
Oh.

17:12.231 --> 17:15.928
And if I do, you'll stop trying
to destroy me in front of Geiss?

17:17.403 --> 17:18.461
Oh.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.867
That is what you're saying,
right?

17:21.006 --> 17:22.633
Here we go.

17:28.680 --> 17:29.840
You're insane!

17:29.982 --> 17:32.542
That's it.
I quit.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.652
No more football.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.952
Jack wins.

17:40.092 --> 17:40.956
Quitter!

17:41.093 --> 17:43.561
Oh, God!
Just like the Greeks.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.690
I'm gonna kill you,
Kenneth the Page!

17:48.834 --> 17:51.735
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan.
I couldn't do it.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.737
This boy comes to the door,
tries to kiss me,

17:54.873 --> 17:56.602
then he throws up
and starts crying.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.200
My body wouldn't let me violate
the sacred bonds of marriage.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.973
It was a gesture, Angie.

18:03.115 --> 18:04.639
I'm saying I'm sorry!

18:04.783 --> 18:07.081
I'm at the end of my rope,
Tracy Jordan.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.083
But, baby!

18:08.220 --> 18:09.084
Mnh-mnh.

18:09.221 --> 18:12.054
No more jewelry
with my name misspelled.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.683
No more sexually explicit
skywriting.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.820
And no more white boys
throwing up in my damn foyer!

18:18.964 --> 18:20.591
What do you want?

18:21.900 --> 18:24.994
I'm willing to try anything.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.901
Okay.
Here's what I want.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.941
From now on, I'm on you
like white on rice.

18:31.076 --> 18:35.137
You are not to leave my sight
for one second. Ever.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.578
All right.

18:38.884 --> 18:40.078
If that's what it takes.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.380
If that's what it takes.

18:44.089 --> 18:46.683
This grilled cheese
has mayonnaise in it!

18:46.825 --> 18:47.792
What?

19:05.777 --> 19:06.744
Hmm.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.012
Is it really worth it?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.015
I wonder.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.245
I almost let a man die today,
Caitlin.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.251
And for what?

19:16.388 --> 19:18.515
For a bigger office?
For more money?

19:20.359 --> 19:22.554
Jack.

19:22.694 --> 19:26.630
So, how's the ticker?

19:26.765 --> 19:28.892
Devin told me.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.229
He said
you're not a well man.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.838
Why don't we forget
about Devin for the moment?

19:33.972 --> 19:36.167
Are you concerned
about my heart, sir?

19:36.308 --> 19:39.300
No, not at all.
Not after today.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.605
You were out there with
those boys in your condition.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.510
Talk about heart.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.676
Take care of yourself,
Jack.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.550
I've technically died
twice.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.351
It's not fun.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.086
But I'm not going to be around
forever.

19:56.228 --> 20:00.324
At some point, I want to spend
more time with my grandkids.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.559
Take my boat
down to the islands.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.399
Get to know my secret family
up in Canada.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.140
But I want you to know
you're on my list.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.169
Jack, you might run this company
one day.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.249
Thank you, sir.

20:27.259 --> 20:30.592
You mind if I watch you
eat that?

20:30.729 --> 20:33.095
Okay.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.070
<i>Werewolf bar mitzvah?</i>

20:42.207 --> 20:43.572
<i>Spooky, scary?</i>

20:43.709 --> 20:45.404
<i>Boys becoming men?</i>

20:45.544 --> 20:47.444
<i>Men becoming wolves?</i>

20:54.219 --> 20:56.244
<i>Werewolf bar mitzvah?</i>

20:56.388 --> 20:58.413
<i>Spooky, scary?</i>

21:02.060 --> 21:04.051
<i>Boys becoming men?</i>

21:04.196 --> 21:06.562
<i>Men becoming wolves?</i>
