00:55.686 --> 00:59.287
<i>So, I would tell you
what year it was,</i>

00:59.289 --> 01:01.325
<i>but I can't actually remember.</i>

01:03.159 --> 01:05.427
<i>I could bore you
with the history,</i>

01:05.429 --> 01:08.530
<i>but you wouldn't listen.</i>

01:08.532 --> 01:14.737
<i>What I can tell you is that
this is the story of a thief.</i>

01:20.544 --> 01:23.413
<i>But it doesn't begin
with the thief you know.</i>

01:26.583 --> 01:28.584
Just gonna
clean out the stables.

01:40.295 --> 01:41.762
So, what were you doing?

01:41.764 --> 01:42.863
None of your business.

01:42.865 --> 01:44.400
It is, if you're
stealing that horse.

01:46.569 --> 01:48.502
They have a break
coming in a minute,

01:48.504 --> 01:51.304
so if you're hoping
to make a clean getaway,

01:51.306 --> 01:52.307
I'd give it a second.

01:53.575 --> 01:54.641
Break time.

01:58.914 --> 01:59.915
I'm Rob.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.949
I'm busy.

02:01.951 --> 02:04.484
A thief's work is never done.

02:04.486 --> 02:07.553
A man lives next door to me.
His horse died.

02:07.555 --> 02:09.624
If he can't plow,
he can't feed his family.

02:11.493 --> 02:13.559
I figured whatever
spoiled toff lives

02:13.561 --> 02:15.460
in this manor
wouldn't miss one of his.

02:15.462 --> 02:18.765
Then you would be absolutely
right, he wouldn't.

02:18.767 --> 02:20.633
Lords that are born
with everything,

02:20.635 --> 02:22.202
want for nothing...

02:22.837 --> 02:23.938
They make me sick.

02:25.507 --> 02:27.408
You don't work in the mines.

02:30.444 --> 02:32.279
Hands too soft
for a tradesman.

02:33.547 --> 02:35.848
Who are you?

02:35.850 --> 02:39.185
I'm the spoiled
toff who lives in this manor.

02:42.255 --> 02:44.625
And you are
completely beautiful.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.561
What about my horse?

02:50.964 --> 02:52.398
He's yours,

02:53.466 --> 02:55.936
if you tell me your name.

03:05.344 --> 03:06.679
Marian.

03:07.814 --> 03:09.482
<i>You can call me Marian.</i>

03:11.517 --> 03:13.852
<i>Robin and Marian.</i>

03:13.854 --> 03:17.353
<i>Seasons passed,
their romance blossomed.</i>

03:17.355 --> 03:18.989
<i>They were young, in love,</i>

03:18.991 --> 03:21.226
<i>and that was
all that mattered...</i>

03:21.894 --> 03:22.962
<i>until...</i>

03:24.797 --> 03:28.266
<i>the cold hand of fate
reached out for them.</i>

03:38.944 --> 03:42.445
<i>He stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.</i>

03:42.447 --> 03:45.014
<i>It became a bedtime story.</i>

03:45.016 --> 03:48.585
<i>But listen, forget history.</i>

03:48.587 --> 03:50.587
<i>Forget what
you've seen before.</i>

03:50.589 --> 03:52.924
<i>Forget what
you think you know.</i>

03:54.492 --> 03:57.629
<i>This is no bedtime story.</i>

03:59.798 --> 04:04.967
<i>If stealing a few coins
was all he did, all he was,</i>

04:04.969 --> 04:09.705
<i>Robin of Loxley
would never have become...</i>

04:09.707 --> 04:11.442
<i>Robin Hood.</i>

04:26.091 --> 04:27.855
<i>I knew him
when he was just another</i>

04:27.857 --> 04:29.992
<i>lord of the manor.</i>

04:29.994 --> 04:32.761
<i>A good life, an easy one.</i>

04:32.763 --> 04:34.897
<i>Born with everything,</i>

04:34.899 --> 04:36.865
<i>want for nothing.</i>

04:38.469 --> 04:41.471
Go away!
Come back never!

04:47.945 --> 04:49.847
<i>What
he didn't know was...</i>

04:52.414 --> 04:54.582
<i>what we are born into...</i>

04:54.584 --> 04:55.716
What's this?

04:55.718 --> 04:58.688
<i>...isn't always who we are.</i>

06:00.147 --> 06:02.182
Look alive, ladies.

06:02.184 --> 06:04.183
We don't want
these bloody savages

06:04.185 --> 06:06.018
knowing we're coming, do we?

06:06.020 --> 06:08.053
Sooner we win this war,

06:08.055 --> 06:10.455
sooner Loxley there
gets what he wants most.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.458
Back home to his sweetheart.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.859
Take cover!

06:19.065 --> 06:20.066
Can't see him!

06:35.682 --> 06:36.716
Gisbourne!

06:44.157 --> 06:46.523
He's reloading.
Listen up.

06:46.525 --> 06:48.192
Two volunteers
for a back slang.

06:48.194 --> 06:49.428
Hmm?

06:50.561 --> 06:52.698
Clayton! You up for a run?

06:53.499 --> 06:54.564
Yeah.

06:54.566 --> 06:56.068
- You ready? Okay. Let's go.
- Yeah.

06:58.570 --> 06:59.638
Go!

07:00.572 --> 07:01.573
Go!

07:08.714 --> 07:09.915
Stay close.

07:32.737 --> 07:33.838
Give me a hand.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.308
Don't go anywhere.
I've got this one, okay?

07:38.310 --> 07:39.708
You stay here,

07:39.710 --> 07:41.245
- watch our backs, okay?
- Okay.

07:44.148 --> 07:45.149
Be back in a minute.

08:08.138 --> 08:09.139
Three.

08:09.973 --> 08:10.974
Come on, Loxley.

08:12.009 --> 08:14.011
Five, six.

08:19.282 --> 08:20.616
Move, move.

08:22.119 --> 08:23.120
Move!

08:32.028 --> 08:33.129
Rob!

08:34.230 --> 08:35.231
Robin!

08:41.903 --> 08:45.671
Where's Clayton?
Where is he?

08:45.673 --> 08:46.907
They've taken him.

08:46.909 --> 08:48.709
Stay with the unit, Loxley.

08:48.711 --> 08:50.545
He's still alive.
I can hear him.

09:03.358 --> 09:05.391
Loxley!

09:05.393 --> 09:07.594
If he's not dead,
he wishes he were.

09:08.129 --> 09:09.862
Leave him to it.

09:09.864 --> 09:12.632
Rob! Rob!

09:12.634 --> 09:14.335
Loxley, leave him.

09:52.705 --> 09:53.739
Cover.

09:56.276 --> 09:57.643
- Clayton!
- Rob!

10:02.915 --> 10:03.916
Ambush!

10:12.725 --> 10:13.726
Rob!

10:38.316 --> 10:40.316
Signal the
Stone Throwers, now!

10:40.318 --> 10:41.251
Yes, sir.

10:41.253 --> 10:44.354
Loxley,
the stones are coming!

10:44.356 --> 10:46.992
Fall back!
That's an order!

10:49.495 --> 10:51.093
Loxley, leave him!

10:51.095 --> 10:52.728
You'll get us
all killed, lad!

10:52.730 --> 10:53.962
He's still alive.

10:53.964 --> 10:55.097
We can't just leave him!

10:55.099 --> 10:57.068
Not your call,
it's an order!

11:07.512 --> 11:09.713
They're coming
like bloody locusts!

12:16.044 --> 12:18.914
Come on! See why you should
follow orders, Your Lordship?

12:19.982 --> 12:21.984
We're pulling back
to the encampment.

12:28.823 --> 12:30.423
Oi,
I want information.

12:30.425 --> 12:34.529
Intelligence, garrison,
troop movements.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.499
Get on your knees,
you pig.

12:40.534 --> 12:42.169
Come on, move, move!

12:44.171 --> 12:45.473
I said,
"Don't look at me!"

12:46.140 --> 12:47.339
On your knees.

12:47.341 --> 12:49.576
- I'm begging you.
- Say it!

12:49.578 --> 12:51.277
I'm begging you.

12:51.279 --> 12:52.280
Do it.

12:52.613 --> 12:53.813
Gis!

12:57.551 --> 12:58.884
What are you doing?

12:58.886 --> 13:00.586
My duty, Loxley.

13:00.588 --> 13:02.587
We have new orders
from above.

13:02.589 --> 13:05.990
Like it or not, soldier,
we're all powerless here.

13:05.992 --> 13:07.992
But they're unarmed.

13:07.994 --> 13:11.097
Then, why don't you run along
and say a prayer for them?

13:16.869 --> 13:18.503
- Mutton.
- Sir?

13:18.505 --> 13:20.807
- Bring another one out.
- Gladly.

13:28.213 --> 13:29.214
Come here.

13:29.649 --> 13:31.114
No!

13:31.116 --> 13:32.250
Come here.

13:32.252 --> 13:34.085
Saleem! Saleem!

13:34.087 --> 13:35.253
- On your knees.
- Let him live.

13:35.255 --> 13:36.289
Stay down!
Let him live.

13:37.390 --> 13:40.123
He's my son.
He's just a boy.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.591
He's my son.

13:43.329 --> 13:45.964
Let him live, I'll tell you what I know.
Everything.

13:46.932 --> 13:48.100
He knows nothing.

13:48.601 --> 13:50.300
Me for him!

13:50.302 --> 13:53.136
I've been killing
Crusaders all my life.

13:53.138 --> 13:55.439
My every breath is an
insult to your God. Please!

13:55.441 --> 13:56.640
Yeah,
you're right, Moor.

13:56.642 --> 14:00.177
So, if you want to save
your son, give me something.

14:00.179 --> 14:02.513
- Give me something!
- Baba, save me!

14:03.281 --> 14:04.949
A thousand soldiers.

14:06.485 --> 14:07.417
To the East.

14:07.419 --> 14:09.954
Our forces routed Tadmur
the day before last.

14:11.122 --> 14:12.255
Something else.

14:12.257 --> 14:13.923
I don't have anything else!

14:13.925 --> 14:15.558
He's my son.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.428
I'm just trying
to save my son.

14:18.663 --> 14:21.297
Well, if it's
any consolation...

14:21.299 --> 14:22.965
- Baba, save me!
- ...you can't.

14:22.967 --> 14:24.603
Sal! Sal!

14:25.336 --> 14:27.001
Saleem!

14:27.003 --> 14:29.338
- Saleem!
- Save me!

14:29.340 --> 14:30.408
No!

14:32.210 --> 14:34.643
Rob! Calm down, Rob!

14:34.645 --> 14:36.278
Calm down, Rob!

14:36.280 --> 14:37.980
Stand down, Loxley!

14:37.982 --> 14:39.381
Remember your place.

14:39.383 --> 14:40.384
Kill the boy!

14:40.617 --> 14:41.619
No!

14:45.723 --> 14:46.923
Saleem!

14:50.360 --> 14:51.461
Saleem, Saleem.

14:55.165 --> 14:56.231
Hold him!

14:57.367 --> 14:59.401
Hold him!

14:59.403 --> 15:02.271
- I'll kill you!
- Put him down! Put him down!

15:06.275 --> 15:07.409
If you weren't a lord,

15:07.411 --> 15:09.078
I'd have you hung for treason.

15:10.547 --> 15:12.213
Flick this worthless toff

15:12.215 --> 15:14.083
on a hospital boat
back to England.

15:58.761 --> 16:00.563
<i>I got you something.</i>

16:05.299 --> 16:06.732
Key to your manor?

16:06.734 --> 16:09.268
It's our home now.

16:09.270 --> 16:12.073
I want to know you're there
while I'm gone.

16:17.611 --> 16:18.612
I love you.

16:20.548 --> 16:21.583
Marian.

16:23.485 --> 16:24.619
Stay alive.

16:27.221 --> 16:28.522
And come back.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.657
I promise you...

16:32.125 --> 16:33.293
<i>I'm coming back.</i>

16:57.818 --> 17:00.351
Nottingham
off the starboard.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.152
Drop the anchor,
gangway.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.233
Marian!

17:55.406 --> 17:56.708
Marian!

18:36.346 --> 18:38.213
What would you confess,
my son?

18:39.816 --> 18:43.584
Tuck, where is Marian?

18:43.586 --> 18:44.587
Robin?

18:45.855 --> 18:47.857
Robin, you're not dead?

18:49.959 --> 18:51.693
No, not for want of trying.

18:52.829 --> 18:54.260
But your name was read out

18:54.262 --> 18:55.730
from the list
of fallen soldiers.

18:55.732 --> 18:57.598
- What?
- Two years ago.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.500
We were told
you were dead.

18:59.502 --> 19:02.335
Marian had a memorial for you.
It was lovely.

19:02.337 --> 19:03.670
I wrote you
a very moving eulogy.

19:03.672 --> 19:05.271
It's a pity you missed it.

19:05.273 --> 19:06.940
Well, I'm thrilled
you missed it,

19:06.942 --> 19:08.675
'cause it would have been

19:08.677 --> 19:10.310
completely inappropriate,
given you are not dead.

19:10.312 --> 19:11.879
- Tuck!
- Yes?

19:11.881 --> 19:14.850
Who read my name from
the list of fallen soldiers?

19:16.384 --> 19:18.384
The Sheriff, but, Robin...

19:18.386 --> 19:19.220
Where is Marian?

19:22.624 --> 19:24.758
Look, things have
taken rather a turn

19:24.760 --> 19:26.694
since you've been gone, Robin.

19:27.561 --> 19:29.328
After you died,

19:29.330 --> 19:32.364
the Sheriff seized
Loxley Manor

19:32.366 --> 19:34.400
as collateral
for his war tax

19:34.402 --> 19:36.569
and threw Marian out.

19:36.571 --> 19:37.936
And it's not just her.

19:37.938 --> 19:40.472
He's crushing us all
with his war effort.

19:40.474 --> 19:42.408
Tolls, collections.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.243
Rob, he's driven
most of the commoners

19:44.245 --> 19:45.346
out of Nottingham proper.

19:46.013 --> 19:47.579
To where?

19:47.581 --> 19:48.582
To the mines.

19:49.749 --> 19:50.983
She's there now?

19:50.985 --> 19:53.921
Yes, but, Rob, Marian's...

19:55.022 --> 19:56.957
This is not
going to end well.

20:21.648 --> 20:23.047
You grab him!

20:23.049 --> 20:24.415
Sheriff's orders.

20:24.417 --> 20:25.485
Bring them
up this way.

21:05.456 --> 21:06.457
Tastes worse.

22:01.411 --> 22:02.411
You?

22:03.612 --> 22:05.481
What the hell
are you doing here?

22:06.917 --> 22:08.515
We've got unfinished business.

22:08.517 --> 22:11.786
No, no business,
you tried to kill...

22:11.788 --> 22:13.821
I stowed away for three
months on your ship.

22:13.823 --> 22:15.656
I could have killed you
there if I wanted to.

22:15.658 --> 22:17.325
Not why I'm here.

22:19.662 --> 22:21.564
I've seen your woman, English.

22:22.565 --> 22:24.665
She is beautiful.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.699
She's not mine anymore,
not since the sheriff...

22:26.701 --> 22:28.536
Shipped you off to war.

22:30.438 --> 22:32.005
You should have killed me.

22:32.007 --> 22:34.508
Everyone thinks I'm dead,
so this must be hell.

22:34.510 --> 22:35.943
You want to know
what hell is?

22:35.945 --> 22:37.844
I lost my hand in this war.

22:37.846 --> 22:39.779
My people were in chains.

22:39.781 --> 22:41.581
My land was pillaged.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.551
And my son was murdered.

22:51.558 --> 22:53.059
I'm sorry
I couldn't save him.

22:53.061 --> 22:54.529
But you tried to.

22:58.566 --> 23:00.867
In all my years of war,

23:00.869 --> 23:02.703
I've never seen
anything like it.

23:04.872 --> 23:06.540
That's why I chose you.

23:08.609 --> 23:09.876
Chose me? What for?

23:09.878 --> 23:12.879
This war, all wars,

23:12.881 --> 23:16.581
and everything happening
here, it's as old as time.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.583
Rich men getting richer.

23:18.585 --> 23:21.953
Men of power taking more power
from the blood of innocents.

23:21.955 --> 23:24.391
Yours, mine,

23:25.126 --> 23:26.759
and my son's.

23:27.660 --> 23:29.595
And I want to stop it.

23:32.866 --> 23:35.135
But I cannot do it alone.

23:37.104 --> 23:39.003
We're just two men.
What can we do?

23:43.110 --> 23:45.509
You're only powerless

23:45.511 --> 23:47.513
if you believe
you're powerless.

23:49.715 --> 23:51.183
Follow me, English.

24:29.220 --> 24:31.488
Good day, good people!

24:33.858 --> 24:35.992
Today, we face a threat

24:35.994 --> 24:39.695
from these barbarians
in Arabia.

24:39.697 --> 24:41.596
They hate us...

24:41.598 --> 24:44.970
Our freedom,
our culture, our religion.

24:46.037 --> 24:47.937
But today,

24:47.939 --> 24:49.905
they face The Near Enemy,

24:49.907 --> 24:52.941
which is our Crusaders,
in the desert.

24:52.943 --> 24:54.209
Let's start here.

24:54.211 --> 24:56.845
But tomorrow, and make
no mistake about this,

24:56.847 --> 25:00.083
they regard us,
here, in Nottingham

25:00.085 --> 25:04.719
as the Far Enemy,
and they will come here.

25:04.721 --> 25:06.989
They will infiltrate,
they will proliferate,

25:06.991 --> 25:09.257
they will choke our courts

25:09.259 --> 25:12.094
and strangle our church,

25:12.096 --> 25:15.997
our children,
with their fanatical dogma.

25:15.999 --> 25:18.200
They'll burn your houses.

25:18.202 --> 25:20.036
They'll burn your lands!

25:22.139 --> 25:23.905
That's why

25:23.907 --> 25:26.009
my War Tax Bill

25:28.077 --> 25:29.511
is so vital.

25:30.713 --> 25:33.614
Nottingham isn't just a city.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.983
It's the bank

25:35.985 --> 25:37.784
and beating heart

25:37.786 --> 25:42.689
of our great church
and its glorious Crusade.

25:42.691 --> 25:44.825
And for every one of you

25:44.827 --> 25:47.094
who shirks his duty

25:47.096 --> 25:49.829
by not paying
his fair share,

25:49.831 --> 25:52.165
an archer goes
without arrows

25:52.167 --> 25:55.201
and a Christian
soldier starves.

25:55.203 --> 25:56.903
Sheriff, my people
have already given

25:56.905 --> 25:57.971
everything that they have.

25:59.941 --> 26:02.909
I move we send my
tax bill to the vote.

26:02.911 --> 26:03.977
I second.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.046
The people of Nottingham
are dying.

26:06.048 --> 26:07.847
We're beyond
the breaking point.

26:07.849 --> 26:10.183
Young lady, you have no idea
what a breaking point is

26:10.185 --> 26:11.820
until you've seen combat.

26:13.255 --> 26:15.255
So, how would you know?

26:17.325 --> 26:20.826
Finance Minister,
do we have a decision?

26:20.828 --> 26:21.963
- We do.
- Uh, sir?

26:22.797 --> 26:24.931
Uh, sir? Sheriff?

26:24.933 --> 26:28.167
The Loxley vote
hasn't been counted.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.768
Robin of Loxley?

26:29.770 --> 26:32.104
What, are we giving
votes to ghosts now?

26:35.310 --> 26:38.009
Yes. Uh, no, he's alive.

26:38.011 --> 26:40.147
Sir, so I hear.

26:41.982 --> 26:43.248
Alive?

26:43.250 --> 26:45.886
He was seen today,
home from war.

26:51.925 --> 26:52.926
Who saw him?

26:54.227 --> 26:55.660
I'm sorry, sir, that falls

26:55.662 --> 26:57.262
under the Seal
of the Confessional.

26:57.264 --> 26:58.863
So, you saw him?

26:58.865 --> 27:01.200
No, I didn't say...

27:01.202 --> 27:03.868
It could have been

27:03.870 --> 27:06.973
anyone saw him.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.842
Oh, dear.

27:10.844 --> 27:12.677
Well, then the vote
must be delayed

27:12.679 --> 27:14.146
until the Loxley
vote's been counted.

27:20.752 --> 27:21.953
You okay?

27:21.955 --> 27:23.254
This council meeting

27:23.256 --> 27:25.422
- is adjourned.
- Yeah.

27:25.424 --> 27:27.724
Strangle our children,
burn our lands.

27:27.726 --> 27:29.259
He acts like you lot
are swarming the bloody

27:29.261 --> 27:31.161
walls of Nottingham already,
the lying bastard.

27:31.163 --> 27:33.230
Do you want to get angry
or do you want to get even?

27:33.232 --> 27:34.764
I want to take
the sheriff down.

27:34.766 --> 27:35.932
I want to hit him
where it hurts.

27:35.934 --> 27:38.901
One thing
keeps him in power.

27:38.903 --> 27:40.070
He's got the whole church
behind him.

27:40.072 --> 27:41.138
He's got an army of...

27:41.140 --> 27:42.174
The money.

27:44.910 --> 27:46.776
What, you mean what he takes

27:46.778 --> 27:48.113
from the commoners
for the war effort?

27:49.047 --> 27:50.913
We steal it.

27:50.915 --> 27:52.047
You heard him.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.450
Nottingham is the bank

27:53.452 --> 27:55.784
and the beating heart
of the Crusades.

27:55.786 --> 27:58.756
And I want to put
a knife through it.

27:59.324 --> 28:00.691
Vengeance for you

28:01.459 --> 28:03.027
and justice for my son.

28:09.434 --> 28:10.735
I'm Robin.

28:14.137 --> 28:16.274
Yahya ibn Umar.

28:19.477 --> 28:21.443
Yokhya...

28:23.314 --> 28:25.847
No.

28:25.849 --> 28:26.981
Please, no more.

28:26.983 --> 28:28.385
In your language,
it's John...

28:29.119 --> 28:30.285
Son of Umar.

28:30.287 --> 28:31.721
John it is.

28:37.294 --> 28:38.459
By night,
you'll be hitting

28:38.461 --> 28:40.195
the sheriff's couriers,

28:40.197 --> 28:43.233
toll takers, tax collectors.

28:45.969 --> 28:46.970
And by day?

28:48.539 --> 28:50.438
You'll be playing
Lord Loxley,

28:50.440 --> 28:51.905
back to your old self.

28:51.907 --> 28:52.873
Drinking and dining with

28:52.875 --> 28:54.509
some of the most
obnoxious people on Earth.

28:54.511 --> 28:57.545
- The rich.
- And why will I be doing that?

28:57.547 --> 28:58.947
Because if
you want to know

28:58.949 --> 29:00.183
where the war money
is really going,

29:01.517 --> 29:02.816
you will have
to charm your way

29:02.818 --> 29:03.886
into the belly
of the beast.

29:05.287 --> 29:07.221
Find out who is
pulling the strings.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.291
Rob?

29:10.560 --> 29:11.760
Marian.

29:13.995 --> 29:15.029
I knew she'd come.

29:16.864 --> 29:18.232
Whatever it is she wants,

29:18.234 --> 29:19.399
she cannot know

29:19.401 --> 29:20.735
- what we're doing.
- Rob?

29:22.871 --> 29:24.306
It's too dangerous
for her and us.

29:25.473 --> 29:29.108
If we get caught,
they will kill us all.

29:29.110 --> 29:32.814
No matter how much you want
to, you cannot go down there.

29:33.382 --> 29:34.516
If you love her,

29:35.950 --> 29:36.952
stick to the plan.

30:13.587 --> 30:16.421
I didn't cross an ocean to
watch you crawl into a bottle.

30:25.131 --> 30:28.366
Maybe she will love
you again, I <i>nshallah,</i>

30:28.368 --> 30:30.903
when she finds out the
truth of what we're doing.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.107
But not before then.

30:40.479 --> 30:42.081
Well, then,
let's get on with it.

30:44.383 --> 30:46.285
You're slow
as the Second Coming.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.218
Yeah, well,
I spent four years

30:49.220 --> 30:50.421
of my life
killing your people.

30:50.423 --> 30:51.988
Well, you missed me.

30:51.990 --> 30:53.324
Yeah, well,
nobody's perfect.

30:53.326 --> 30:54.460
You must be.

30:55.961 --> 30:57.161
I can fire
two arrows a second.

30:57.163 --> 30:59.999
Yeah, you could fire
two arrows a second.

31:02.534 --> 31:04.069
You think you're faster?

31:06.472 --> 31:07.506
Shoot me.

31:09.275 --> 31:11.544
- Beg your pardon?
- You've killed hundreds of us!

31:13.044 --> 31:14.346
What's one more?

31:15.347 --> 31:16.348
Okay.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.089
Please. I said shoot me.

31:24.523 --> 31:25.954
Too slow.

31:25.956 --> 31:27.623
Fast as you can!

31:27.625 --> 31:29.159
Again, come on, English!

31:36.434 --> 31:37.434
Again.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.442
Too slow.

31:47.512 --> 31:49.480
This war will be
fought up close.

31:51.181 --> 31:52.383
You'll need
a street weapon.

31:54.184 --> 31:56.286
Give me that relic,
it's firewood.

31:57.354 --> 31:58.721
Relax your grip.

31:58.723 --> 32:01.057
Allow the bow
to rest in your palm.

32:01.457 --> 32:02.892
Now try.

32:06.597 --> 32:08.162
Try again.

32:08.164 --> 32:11.133
Only this time,
try the other side.

32:11.135 --> 32:13.169
It will save you a second
on the reload.

32:19.509 --> 32:21.077
Yes. Come on!

32:22.044 --> 32:23.411
Again!

32:23.413 --> 32:25.415
Faster!
Yes, English, faster!

32:29.485 --> 32:31.017
<i>You were a lord,</i>

32:31.019 --> 32:33.421
<i>but now,
you get to be a thief.</i>

32:33.423 --> 32:35.389
Left!

32:35.391 --> 32:37.058
<i>And I'm going
to show you how.</i>

32:41.764 --> 32:44.598
<i>This won't be like
any war you're used to.</i>

32:44.600 --> 32:45.635
Right! Left!

32:47.068 --> 32:48.069
Arrows.

32:51.139 --> 32:52.140
To the right.

32:53.008 --> 32:54.240
Exactly.

32:54.242 --> 32:56.476
Faster. Stronger!

32:56.478 --> 32:57.979
Faster, English!

33:03.083 --> 33:04.784
What are you doing
to my coat?

33:04.786 --> 33:06.352
It's too long.

33:06.354 --> 33:08.153
It's slowing you down.

33:08.155 --> 33:10.258
When do I actually get
to, you know, steal?

33:12.194 --> 33:13.494
Really liked this coat.

33:14.795 --> 33:17.129
Well, now, it's a jacket.

33:17.131 --> 33:19.064
Turn your hand
into a quiver.

33:19.066 --> 33:20.466
The more arrows
you can hold,

33:20.468 --> 33:22.234
the more arrows
you can fire.

33:22.236 --> 33:23.638
Shut up, you're not making
it easier, you know?

33:24.506 --> 33:25.539
Yes! Yes!

33:46.059 --> 33:47.359
<i>Fight with stealth,</i>

33:47.361 --> 33:49.126
<i>strike from the shadows.</i>

33:49.128 --> 33:50.763
<i>By the time they return fire,</i>

33:52.632 --> 33:54.000
<i>you're gone.</i>

33:57.738 --> 33:59.239
What else you got?

34:19.324 --> 34:21.257
You've been digging
through my old laundry, John.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.260
You cannot go see the
sheriff in those rags.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.262
You must donate
to his war effort

34:25.264 --> 34:27.297
and you will get in
good with him.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.364
Get in good with him?

34:28.367 --> 34:30.233
He'll be lucky if I
don't take his head off.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.402
We pull the tail,
you see who bites.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.572
- So...
- So, to follow the money,

34:35.574 --> 34:37.408
you must gain
the trust of the sheriff.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.877
And what am I
going to donate?

34:40.879 --> 34:43.382
It's not exactly like we're
rolling in coin, is it?

34:44.483 --> 34:46.083
Tonight, you take down
the toll bridge.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.752
Now you're talking, John.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.755
I'm glad you approve, English.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.291
What is this?

34:54.125 --> 34:55.126
That was my son's.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.895
Thank you.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.798
You wanted to steal?

35:01.599 --> 35:02.833
Now's your time.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.236
Take that load
off to the treasury.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.203
You, come on.

35:08.205 --> 35:09.772
By the order
of the Sheriff of Nottingham,

35:09.774 --> 35:11.140
you need to pay the toll.

35:11.142 --> 35:12.508
Stop the cart!

35:12.510 --> 35:14.142
You have to pay
the sheriff's toll.

35:14.144 --> 35:16.411
- Didn't used to have to pay.
- Check this bag.

35:16.413 --> 35:18.614
Come on, what you got
in the back?

35:18.616 --> 35:20.449
We have no more money!

35:22.218 --> 35:24.218
Come on, old man,
cough it up!

35:24.220 --> 35:25.453
Get up!

35:27.424 --> 35:28.425
Hey!

35:46.476 --> 35:47.477
Hey!

35:48.378 --> 35:49.843
Where is he?
Where did he go?

35:49.845 --> 35:51.780
- Where the hell are they?
- I can't see him. Where is he?

35:59.489 --> 36:00.490
Too slow.

36:22.344 --> 36:23.545
Lord Loxley.

36:25.313 --> 36:29.615
All of Nottingham rejoices

36:29.617 --> 36:32.551
that the tragic rumors
of your death are unfounded.

36:32.553 --> 36:35.689
I'd like to thank you
personally for your service.

36:35.691 --> 36:38.824
You sent me off
for a just cause.

36:38.826 --> 36:40.593
It was my honor, sir.

36:40.595 --> 36:42.495
Ah, I do hope
you're not going to

36:42.497 --> 36:44.897
hold my seizing
of your manor against me.

36:44.899 --> 36:46.532
It's a pity
it's a fog of war.

36:46.534 --> 36:47.767
Don't give it
a second thought.

36:47.769 --> 36:49.302
I'm fixing it up already.

36:50.437 --> 36:52.406
You did
what you had to do, sir.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.407
And here's my fair share

36:55.409 --> 36:57.342
for the war effort.

36:57.344 --> 36:59.445
But you've already
given so much.

36:59.447 --> 37:00.646
No, our troops need it.

37:00.648 --> 37:01.648
I should know.

37:02.582 --> 37:03.950
I was there.

37:08.022 --> 37:08.822
Please.

37:12.859 --> 37:15.292
Well, I hope,
now that you're back,

37:15.294 --> 37:17.327
I get to see
a lot more of you.

37:17.329 --> 37:19.464
As much as
you'll allow, sir.

37:19.466 --> 37:21.368
I hope to earn your favor.

37:53.431 --> 37:55.666
You put the rest of us
to shame

37:55.668 --> 37:57.935
with your
generosity, Loxley.

37:57.937 --> 38:00.304
I'd like to be able
to count on an invitation

38:00.306 --> 38:01.738
the next time
the lords meet, sir.

38:01.740 --> 38:02.972
But it's your right.
It would be my pleasure.

38:02.974 --> 38:06.944
After all, the youth vote
could use a voice in chambers.

38:06.946 --> 38:08.745
You flatter me
with your confidence, sir.

38:08.747 --> 38:09.815
Yes, I know.

38:12.350 --> 38:13.350
Rob.

38:26.330 --> 38:28.298
The other day,
at the manor,

38:29.666 --> 38:32.704
I came by.
I needed to see you.

38:35.607 --> 38:36.774
Anything else?

38:37.908 --> 38:38.840
Why are you
making this so hard?

38:38.842 --> 38:41.578
Do you really expect me
to make it easy?

38:44.448 --> 38:47.384
Marian, you promised me
that you would wait for me.

38:48.086 --> 38:49.820
They told me
you were dead.

38:50.954 --> 38:52.355
Lord Loxley.

39:02.865 --> 39:04.832
Lord Loxley.

39:04.834 --> 39:06.904
Look, sorry,
I've got to go.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.810
I don't trust
you around her.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.144
What? I played my part.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.646
If you need
some motivation,

39:18.648 --> 39:19.880
if she finds out
what we're up to,

39:19.882 --> 39:22.351
it's her head on the chopping
block, the same as ours.

39:22.919 --> 39:24.517
Really inspiring.

39:24.519 --> 39:25.520
Thanks.

39:33.596 --> 39:35.663
Seems
Lord Loxley's inspired

39:35.665 --> 39:38.099
an embarrassment
of riches today?

39:59.120 --> 40:02.656
Shall I count to ten
before I raise the alarm?

40:03.858 --> 40:04.926
Make it 20.

41:03.182 --> 41:04.183
Who is it?

41:06.252 --> 41:07.452
I don't know.

41:09.621 --> 41:12.956
Sir. There's been
another robbery.

41:12.958 --> 41:14.691
He's not gonna like that.

41:14.693 --> 41:17.827
Sir, there's been
an occurrence,

41:17.829 --> 41:19.996
which on first observation,

41:19.998 --> 41:23.833
might be classified
as non-ideal, fiscally.

41:23.835 --> 41:26.702
Oh, God,
give me strength.

41:26.704 --> 41:33.209
Sir, sir, there's been
another minor incident.

41:33.211 --> 41:37.212
The good news is neither of
the guards was badly killed.

41:37.214 --> 41:38.281
What?

41:38.283 --> 41:40.083
The collection box,

41:40.085 --> 41:43.219
from right under our noses
at Sunday service.

41:43.221 --> 41:45.688
Oh, and the toll road
last night,

41:45.690 --> 41:47.023
so a bit of a pickle.

41:47.025 --> 41:50.192
Pembroke! Get those
documents under lock and key.

41:50.194 --> 41:52.194
Who else knows about this?

41:52.196 --> 41:53.896
I came straight to you.

41:53.898 --> 41:57.066
But I suppose the archdeacon
should be told.

41:57.068 --> 41:58.534
Shh. No, no, no, no, no.

41:58.536 --> 42:00.303
We don't want him gossiping
to the cardinal.

42:00.305 --> 42:01.803
But, sir,
surely the church...

42:01.805 --> 42:03.205
It's a law and order issue.

42:03.207 --> 42:04.873
I'm the law and order here.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.041
Tighten the security.

42:06.043 --> 42:09.244
All tax collections now go
directly to the count room,

42:09.246 --> 42:11.580
and double the guard
at the treasury.

42:11.582 --> 42:12.680
As you say, sir.

42:12.682 --> 42:15.550
I can't afford to lose
another penny.

42:15.552 --> 42:18.989
Sir, it's been a bit
since your last confession.

42:21.225 --> 42:23.995
Would you care to unburden
yourself to your friar?

42:25.261 --> 42:29.165
My conscience is clear.
Is yours?

42:31.634 --> 42:34.135
Try as I might, mine's
always a bit of a muddle.

42:34.137 --> 42:35.603
Well, be that as it may,

42:35.605 --> 42:37.904
keep your ears open
in your little booth.

42:37.906 --> 42:40.174
Any talk of the thief,
bring it to me.

42:40.176 --> 42:41.142
But, sir, with respect,

42:41.144 --> 42:43.011
the Seal of the
Confessional is sacred.

42:43.013 --> 42:45.712
Nothing's sacred till
I've caught that thief

42:45.714 --> 42:47.717
and drowned him in a cage.

42:56.058 --> 42:57.258
You're up late.

42:57.260 --> 42:58.625
Just making my rounds,

42:58.627 --> 43:01.962
found myself craving
a little sustenance.

43:01.964 --> 43:05.032
I wanted to tell you that the
sheriff's coming down hard

43:05.034 --> 43:07.100
in response
to the robberies.

43:07.102 --> 43:09.271
It complicates our plans.

43:10.339 --> 43:12.805
How are you getting on?

43:12.807 --> 43:16.211
Best I can.
Had some help.

43:17.146 --> 43:19.048
Bag of coins
left at my door.

43:19.614 --> 43:20.615
By the Hood?

43:22.017 --> 43:23.850
That's what
I call him now.

43:23.852 --> 43:27.053
It's got a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

43:27.055 --> 43:28.956
Don't know why
he's giving the money to me.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.090
Guess I'm flattered.

43:31.092 --> 43:32.892
You should be.

43:32.894 --> 43:35.696
But I wish he would
give it to the people instead.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.000
Quick! Grab the money!

45:13.391 --> 45:16.758
With respect, sheriff,

45:16.760 --> 45:20.731
this thief is making you
look like a damn fool.

45:26.470 --> 45:27.838
If I may...

45:30.107 --> 45:32.241
I propose a bounty.

45:32.243 --> 45:35.311
Surely you don't expect us
to finance it.

45:35.313 --> 45:37.912
No. I will
stake it personally.

45:37.914 --> 45:40.448
Should we say a thousand
a week to begin with?

45:40.450 --> 45:42.450
Then I'll double it
every week, thereafter,

45:42.452 --> 45:44.087
until he's either caught

45:44.454 --> 45:45.987
or killed.

45:45.989 --> 45:47.958
Right. The rest of you, out.

45:52.462 --> 45:54.431
Pembroke.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.401
Out!

46:05.942 --> 46:07.176
Those lords.

46:08.978 --> 46:12.313
Days like this
that I just wanna

46:12.315 --> 46:14.950
stick my thumb
into their windpipes.

46:15.917 --> 46:17.117
You really hate them.

46:17.119 --> 46:18.886
Oh, well,

46:18.888 --> 46:20.120
you know, their daddies were

46:20.122 --> 46:21.922
the Guardians
of the Foundling House,

46:21.924 --> 46:24.457
where I spent my youth.

46:24.459 --> 46:29.162
And they would come around
at night to discipline us.

46:29.164 --> 46:32.899
With the archdeacon
and his clergy in tow.

46:32.901 --> 46:34.335
And all of them drunk,

46:34.337 --> 46:39.872
breath stinking of
boiled beef.

46:39.874 --> 46:42.275
And they would've
sent us out to buy

46:42.277 --> 46:44.510
the canes which they
were gonna beat us with.

46:44.512 --> 46:46.246
You could tell how long
the last beating was

46:46.248 --> 46:47.481
because the color
of the welts

46:47.483 --> 46:49.482
would go from red
to blue, to yellow.

46:49.484 --> 46:51.049
Finally,
they would go to pink,

46:51.051 --> 46:52.818
and the skin would harden.

46:52.820 --> 46:56.990
And by that time, Loxley,
you had to make a choice.

46:56.992 --> 46:59.058
You're gonna let them
beat the strength out of you

46:59.060 --> 47:00.761
or they're gonna
beat it into you.

47:03.264 --> 47:07.866
When they used the broomsticks
on the little boys,

47:07.868 --> 47:11.905
and they would scream.

47:13.906 --> 47:19.344
Then, they'd pour some brandy
down their throats as a mercy.

47:19.346 --> 47:22.850
Now, I never screamed, but...

47:24.083 --> 47:28.054
I hate the taste of brandy.

47:31.024 --> 47:34.559
Shall we hang a few of them?
Those lords?

47:34.561 --> 47:39.432
Just to see them
shit their silks?

47:42.435 --> 47:45.570
Why don't we
just hang one of them?

47:45.572 --> 47:49.373
'Cause I suspect the rest
would soon fall into line.

47:57.383 --> 48:00.152
I am not after crumbs.

48:02.054 --> 48:05.257
I want a seat
at the big table.

48:07.560 --> 48:11.129
Well then,
you'll keep my favor, Loxley.

48:20.172 --> 48:21.741
It's Rob, right?

48:25.610 --> 48:27.011
You're Will.

48:28.079 --> 48:29.481
Welcome home.

48:31.516 --> 48:32.582
Must've been hell
for you over there.

48:32.584 --> 48:35.420
I fought the war,
I don't need to talk about it.

48:36.620 --> 48:40.489
Look, I get it.
I really do.

48:40.491 --> 48:43.660
It must be overwhelming
coming home, Marian...

48:43.662 --> 48:44.860
She's her own woman.

48:44.862 --> 48:47.464
Well, that's right. So you
don't have to be okay with me.

48:47.466 --> 48:48.599
Good. Because I'm not.

48:54.105 --> 48:55.239
I heard you.

48:56.273 --> 48:58.109
During the sheriff's speech.

48:58.642 --> 49:00.043
Voice of the people.

49:02.379 --> 49:03.579
They need one.

49:03.581 --> 49:04.948
What about the Hood?

49:05.982 --> 49:07.117
The Hood.

49:11.188 --> 49:12.322
He means nothing to me.

49:13.523 --> 49:15.490
He'll be caught,
and forgotten.

49:15.492 --> 49:16.958
And what I, Marian,
and the rest

49:16.960 --> 49:18.092
of the commoners
are fighting for

49:18.094 --> 49:20.194
is much bigger
than some petty thief

49:20.196 --> 49:22.098
turning over a few couriers
and collection boxes.

49:25.435 --> 49:27.202
Still, I wouldn't
bet against him.

49:30.607 --> 49:33.109
I reckon
he's just getting started.

49:36.412 --> 49:40.382
John! I've had
a thought. Hear me out.

49:45.488 --> 49:47.187
I wanna go big.

49:47.189 --> 49:49.556
Forget couriers
and collection boxes.

49:49.558 --> 49:51.558
I wanna hit
the treasury itself.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.659
Hard target.

49:52.661 --> 49:55.230
Pull the tail,
see who bites!

49:57.199 --> 49:58.534
How would you do it?

50:06.174 --> 50:07.541
Easy, governor.

50:07.543 --> 50:09.576
- Move! Move!
- Help a hungry veteran.

50:09.578 --> 50:11.178
Get out of the way.

50:11.180 --> 50:12.545
Men, get this filth
out of the way!

50:12.547 --> 50:14.079
Lost me hand in the war.

50:14.081 --> 50:16.783
Be a pal
and spare some change.

50:16.785 --> 50:20.286
God. This is a nice ass on this horse.
Please, sir.

50:22.223 --> 50:25.292
Get out of the way! Get out!

51:04.431 --> 51:06.731
Change of protocol,
as per the sheriff.

51:06.733 --> 51:09.133
All collections are no longer
to be stored in the vault.

51:09.135 --> 51:10.368
They go straight
to the count room

51:10.370 --> 51:11.603
for immediate processing.

51:11.605 --> 51:12.605
Shit!

51:49.774 --> 51:52.275
Guards! Guards!

51:52.277 --> 51:54.078
Guards! Guards!

53:43.351 --> 53:44.484
Shit! Shit!

53:50.524 --> 53:51.558
Come on, come on!

53:52.559 --> 53:54.428
Come on, come on! Come on!

54:00.501 --> 54:02.436
There he is!

54:27.293 --> 54:28.626
They're coming, John!

54:28.628 --> 54:30.563
Ye of little faith!

54:32.665 --> 54:34.267
Hyah.

54:39.539 --> 54:40.707
Yeah!

54:41.541 --> 54:43.774
It's the Hood!

54:43.776 --> 54:45.509
That's how you go big!

54:45.511 --> 54:47.677
We didn't get a single coin!

54:47.679 --> 54:49.345
We wanted
to get their attention.

54:49.347 --> 54:50.413
And we have it now.

55:30.387 --> 55:33.890
Our cardinal has asked me to
convey to you his disquiet,

55:33.892 --> 55:37.526
at your so-far defensive
response to this thief.

55:37.528 --> 55:39.762
It's nothing
I can't handle.

55:39.764 --> 55:42.998
You can tell His Eminence
he needn't lose any sleep.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.768
Reassure him yourself in due time.
He's coming here.

55:45.770 --> 55:48.469
From Rome?
Over a petty thief?

55:48.471 --> 55:50.505
The church does not consider

55:50.507 --> 55:53.441
the raiding
of its treasury petty.

55:53.443 --> 55:56.512
Ah, he barely escaped,
and he got away with nothing.

55:56.514 --> 55:59.517
But what's dangerous is
the audacity of his crimes.

56:00.750 --> 56:04.886
He's got our commoners
looking up, seeing hope.

56:04.888 --> 56:08.723
We want their backs bent
and heads bowed.

56:08.725 --> 56:10.995
There's been
whispers of revolt.

56:13.129 --> 56:18.065
Unchecked, those whispers
will build into a roar.

56:18.067 --> 56:21.903
It's treason.
Punishable by death.

56:21.905 --> 56:24.671
Treason's a very
strong word, sir.

56:24.673 --> 56:28.910
Isn't the Christian thing
to turn the other cheek?

56:28.912 --> 56:31.580
How do you love a God
that gives you that face?

56:40.756 --> 56:42.057
Sheriff!

56:43.792 --> 56:46.963
Given our shared interest
in the outcome of the war,

56:48.396 --> 56:50.462
it's essential
this thief is caught

56:50.464 --> 56:52.100
and his rhetoric suffocated.

56:55.904 --> 56:57.739
I'll restore the order.

56:59.707 --> 57:04.779
You keep the faith,
Your Grace.

57:05.446 --> 57:06.779
Sheriff,

57:06.781 --> 57:09.481
the church can make a man,
or break him.

57:09.483 --> 57:11.717
For your allegiance,
we offer you the world.

57:11.719 --> 57:13.786
But in failure,
we can also take it away.

57:17.758 --> 57:20.561
Remember that. Hmm?

57:22.530 --> 57:24.564
Let's make the cardinal
feel welcome, sheriff.

57:28.936 --> 57:30.468
Ah!

57:30.470 --> 57:35.740
If you ever defy me again
in front of the church...

57:35.742 --> 57:39.010
I'm sorry, sir. I was only
speaking for the Gospels.

57:39.012 --> 57:42.814
Oh, the Gospels. Well,
never, never forget, Tuck,

57:42.816 --> 57:46.087
God's up there.
I'm down here.

57:48.654 --> 57:50.622
Now, I've taken the measure

57:50.624 --> 57:52.624
of hiring
some special deputies.

57:52.626 --> 57:55.693
Some of our most
trusted crusaders.

57:55.695 --> 57:57.729
They're just back
from Arabia.

57:57.731 --> 58:01.031
Here they are to receive
the archdeacon's blessing

58:01.033 --> 58:04.501
before they begin
their good, good works.

58:04.503 --> 58:05.602
Sheriff.

58:05.604 --> 58:07.171
Commander Gisbourne.

58:07.173 --> 58:11.775
They look very eager
to do God's work.

58:11.777 --> 58:15.414
Yes. With the devil's pride.

58:18.117 --> 58:19.616
<i>One, two,
three, four, five.</i>

58:20.853 --> 58:23.187
We've done it!
We've done it.

58:23.189 --> 58:25.721
The cardinal is coming
all the way from Rome.

58:25.723 --> 58:27.224
The sheriff is
throwing him a party,

58:27.226 --> 58:28.624
and guess who's invited?

58:28.626 --> 58:30.894
- It's my day off.
- No days off, English.

58:30.896 --> 58:32.195
You'll rest when you're dead.

58:32.197 --> 58:33.931
He's coming
because of the Hood.

58:33.933 --> 58:35.598
Our plan is working!

58:35.600 --> 58:37.900
That's very easy to say
from where you're standing.

58:37.902 --> 58:39.535
The cardinal
is one of the most

58:39.537 --> 58:41.138
powerful people
in the world.

58:41.140 --> 58:44.942
Whatever he's come to tell
the sheriff, we must hear it.

58:44.944 --> 58:47.542
I think what you mean
is I must hear it.

58:47.544 --> 58:50.880
It will be
an orgy of excess.

58:50.882 --> 58:52.815
A flamboyant
costume party,

58:52.817 --> 58:55.853
the perfect place to put the
Loxley charm to the test.

58:57.021 --> 59:00.724
We pulled the tail.
Now we see who bites.

59:09.867 --> 59:13.503
Come, come, come in.
Or catch your death.

59:17.941 --> 59:19.841
It's good you came.

59:19.843 --> 59:22.078
I, uh, thought you might.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.647
Will and I got an invite
to the cardinal's party.

59:25.648 --> 59:26.982
Was that your doing?

59:26.984 --> 59:29.751
I may have put a word
into the sheriff's ear

59:29.753 --> 59:32.787
as to the
political astuteness

59:32.789 --> 59:36.623
of tossing commoners a few
crumbs from the guest list.

59:36.625 --> 59:38.861
I may never get into
the palace again.

59:39.929 --> 59:41.231
This is our shot.

59:42.265 --> 59:43.900
And we must take it.

59:44.801 --> 59:45.900
And Will?

59:45.902 --> 59:46.970
He can't know
what we're doing.

59:49.238 --> 59:50.704
He wouldn't approve.

59:50.706 --> 59:52.608
Rob will be there, surely.

59:57.913 --> 59:58.846
And?

59:58.848 --> 01:00:01.949
Marian, what we are
doing is very dangerous.

01:00:01.951 --> 01:00:06.286
We cannot risk letting our
emotions compromise it.

01:00:06.288 --> 01:00:08.257
- You and Rob...
- Tuck, I know.

01:00:09.325 --> 01:00:10.860
You sure
you're up for this?

01:00:13.028 --> 01:00:14.260
No.

01:00:33.148 --> 01:00:34.149
Here,
you're Lord Loxley.

01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:36.114
Play your part.

01:00:36.116 --> 01:00:38.016
Drink. Don't get drunk.

01:00:38.018 --> 01:00:39.285
Killjoy.

01:00:39.287 --> 01:00:42.855
But above all, you must get
an audience with the cardinal.

01:00:42.857 --> 01:00:45.691
John. I've got this.

01:00:45.693 --> 01:00:48.293
I was born to be here.
Remember?

01:00:53.067 --> 01:00:54.568
Wow!

01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:59.074
Lord Loxley. Hmm?

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:01.041
Ah...

01:01:02.376 --> 01:01:06.711
Nothing more than just
a lapdog to the rich.

01:01:06.713 --> 01:01:07.913
So did you run out

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:09.781
of prisoners
to execute in the desert?

01:01:09.783 --> 01:01:11.248
No.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.851
Got old and boring.

01:01:13.853 --> 01:01:19.592
My new employer has me
hunting more elusive prey now.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.271
Enjoy the party.

01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:01.366
Come on, seven!

01:02:04.336 --> 01:02:06.402
Stealing from
the rich to give to the poor?

01:02:06.404 --> 01:02:07.737
He's taking the piss out

01:02:07.739 --> 01:02:09.272
of the whole
damn natural order.

01:02:09.274 --> 01:02:10.206
Oh, you flatter him.

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:12.841
He's a smash and grabber,
nothing more.

01:02:12.843 --> 01:02:15.077
And hideously ugly,
hence that ridiculous hood.

01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:19.317
I wonder
if he isn't a veteran.

01:02:20.352 --> 01:02:21.652
Huh?

01:02:23.154 --> 01:02:25.053
Of the Crusades?

01:02:25.055 --> 01:02:28.859
Clearly, he's well-trained.
He's audacious.

01:02:29.427 --> 01:02:32.029
Adaptable under fire.

01:02:32.897 --> 01:02:34.129
Hmm.

01:02:34.131 --> 01:02:36.030
Living on luck there, sir.

01:02:36.032 --> 01:02:37.199
You'll get him eventually.

01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:39.168
The elites
shouldn't be surprised

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:40.938
by the thief's revolution.

01:02:42.473 --> 01:02:44.375
You created
the conditions for it.

01:02:45.209 --> 01:02:46.210
Marian.

01:02:48.978 --> 01:02:51.245
Your beauty
leaves me speechless.

01:02:51.247 --> 01:02:52.947
Sheriff, I take it
you know Marian.

01:02:52.949 --> 01:02:57.388
Oh, yes. The sweet scourge
of many a town hall speech.

01:02:58.788 --> 01:03:00.056
So, Marian.

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:02.725
Who do you think
the thief is?

01:03:03.526 --> 01:03:05.061
He's all of us.

01:03:05.962 --> 01:03:07.028
That's what counts.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.063
Ah...

01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:11.099
So you're an admirer.

01:03:12.935 --> 01:03:15.102
He has his qualities.

01:03:15.104 --> 01:03:17.271
Marian, there you are.

01:03:17.273 --> 01:03:19.008
Shouldn't wander off
too far, my love.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.814
We appreciate you having us here, sir.
We really do.

01:03:27.816 --> 01:03:28.949
I have ambitions.

01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:32.553
And we both know the poor
need strong leaders. Like us.

01:03:32.555 --> 01:03:33.820
Indeed.

01:03:33.822 --> 01:03:37.123
Or else they get seduced
by criminals like the Hood.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.358
Oh.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.859
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, my Lord!

01:03:39.861 --> 01:03:40.827
What have I done there?

01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:42.796
I've got juice all over
your thing there.

01:03:42.798 --> 01:03:44.264
- Let me wipe...
- Get off me!

01:03:44.266 --> 01:03:45.865
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Get off!

01:03:45.867 --> 01:03:47.299
- Tuck!
- Yes, sir?

01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:49.268
- You're an idiot.
- My apologies.

01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:52.137
Apologies. Halt and lame.
That's me, sir.

01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:54.039
Halt and lame.

01:03:54.041 --> 01:03:55.908
I have no doubt
you'll have the Hood.

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:57.745
Takes a thief
to catch a thief.

01:05:33.938 --> 01:05:35.338
Your Eminence.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.542
Get off your knees.
Time is short.

01:05:48.151 --> 01:05:49.418
Hood's robberies

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.423
threaten our plans
for the war.

01:05:53.691 --> 01:05:56.027
You want my reassurance?

01:06:02.533 --> 01:06:03.967
You are afraid.

01:06:06.036 --> 01:06:07.372
You should be.

01:06:08.205 --> 01:06:09.238
Do you know why?

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.108
Why don't you enlighten
me, Your Eminence?

01:06:13.110 --> 01:06:18.482
Fear is the greatest weapon
in God's arsenal.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:25.287
It is why
the church created hell.

01:06:37.166 --> 01:06:38.434
Robin.

01:06:40.369 --> 01:06:41.969
Tuck!

01:06:41.971 --> 01:06:44.972
How long have
you known me?

01:06:44.974 --> 01:06:46.374
Since you were a boy.

01:06:46.376 --> 01:06:47.641
And you trust me?

01:06:47.643 --> 01:06:48.975
With my life.

01:06:48.977 --> 01:06:49.978
Excellent.

01:06:52.114 --> 01:06:54.550
This piece of scum
is a thief!

01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:57.084
He stole
Lord Pembroke's keys.

01:06:57.086 --> 01:06:59.285
I don't know
what he's talking about.

01:06:59.287 --> 01:07:01.622
You can search me.
I don't have any keys.

01:07:01.624 --> 01:07:03.289
Loxley's right.
They're gone.

01:07:03.291 --> 01:07:04.491
Oh.

01:07:04.493 --> 01:07:08.195
Take a guard, find the key,
check every room they open.

01:07:08.197 --> 01:07:09.329
You, come with me.

01:07:09.331 --> 01:07:11.063
Explain yourself, Friar.

01:07:11.065 --> 01:07:12.432
I didn't steal anything.

01:07:12.434 --> 01:07:14.936
Well, then you must
know who did. Huh?

01:07:15.703 --> 01:07:16.704
Confess!

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.610
Just kill him.

01:07:27.114 --> 01:07:28.183
Wait!

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:46.999
The commoners
love this worm.

01:07:48.469 --> 01:07:50.435
And I think
he wants to die.

01:07:50.437 --> 01:07:53.104
I think he wants
to be their martyr.

01:07:53.106 --> 01:07:56.074
So let's give him a fate
worse than death.

01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:57.478
Revoke his church.

01:07:58.545 --> 01:08:01.445
Defrock him!

01:08:01.447 --> 01:08:03.214
And throw him
to the streets.

01:08:03.216 --> 01:08:06.284
That should cut him a little
deeper than any blade could.

01:08:06.286 --> 01:08:08.653
Don't! You can't!
Your Grace, please!

01:08:08.655 --> 01:08:10.288
Oh, I can and I do.

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:13.224
For the crime of falsehood
under canon law,

01:08:13.226 --> 01:08:16.426
get this disgrace
out of my sight!

01:08:27.406 --> 01:08:29.240
Who is this young man?

01:08:29.242 --> 01:08:31.676
This is
Robin of Loxley.

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:35.613
- And I trust him.
- Hmm.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:41.184
You are the grace
and good work

01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:43.622
of the Lord made flesh,
Your Eminence.

01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:46.423
Good.

01:08:46.425 --> 01:08:50.560
The young are God's gift
to the church.

01:08:50.562 --> 01:08:52.264
The arrows in our quiver.

01:08:56.769 --> 01:08:58.103
No, no, stay.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:05.408
Welcome to
the big table, Loxley.

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.810
Now whatever
this Hood has done...

01:09:07.812 --> 01:09:09.312
I will have him.

01:09:09.314 --> 01:09:10.314
Silence!

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:16.318
If we are to continue
funding the Arabs

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.120
and defeat the English army

01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:21.493
so that you and I can take
control from the king,

01:09:22.594 --> 01:09:24.292
the money we owe them

01:09:24.295 --> 01:09:27.729
must sail in four days.
Do that

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:32.403
and we will have bought
absolute power.

01:09:34.572 --> 01:09:37.639
And if I need more time
to raise the money?

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.143
You had your time, sheriff.

01:09:41.879 --> 01:09:44.715
Satisfy me that you can
do what must be done!

01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:51.419
You want to see fear?

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:55.423
I'll send my men
to raid the mines tonight.

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:56.594
Now,

01:09:57.595 --> 01:09:59.460
when that's done,

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:03.464
I'll take the commoners
for everything they've got,

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:06.334
from their pisspots
to their pocket coins.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.935
And when that is done,

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:13.206
I will burn their
shit slums to the ground.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.375
Just to remind them
they're not the people,

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.879
they're my subjects.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.485
Will that
satisfy you, priest?

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:29.257
Go with God, sheriff.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.259
Talk to me.

01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:35.227
We've got to get
to the mines.

01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:36.297
Now.

01:10:53.915 --> 01:10:55.782
Let's start with
where did you even get this?

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:56.883
That doesn't matter.

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.551
Oh, it matters, Marian.

01:10:58.553 --> 01:10:59.718
This is in Arabic

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.487
with the sheriff's
signature underneath.

01:11:01.489 --> 01:11:02.755
Which could mean anything.

01:11:02.757 --> 01:11:03.822
Or nothing.

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:06.458
What is plain is that
however you came by these,

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.396
it wasn't honestly.

01:11:09.797 --> 01:11:11.229
Don't do that.

01:11:11.231 --> 01:11:12.597
What? I'm talking to you.

01:11:12.599 --> 01:11:14.265
Like a child!

01:11:14.267 --> 01:11:16.769
Don't handle me.

01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:18.704
<i>Okay, I'm gonna
take these to the sheriff</i>

01:11:18.706 --> 01:11:19.940
<i>to give him a chance
to explain for himself.</i>

01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:21.642
I'll take them.

01:11:22.842 --> 01:11:24.709
To someone
I know I can trust.

01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:27.480
When did I lose your trust?

01:11:28.682 --> 01:11:30.949
Your way.

01:11:30.951 --> 01:11:34.587
All your politics.
It's not changing anything.

01:11:35.387 --> 01:11:36.956
Please see that.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:39.490
Have you even
spared a second

01:11:39.492 --> 01:11:40.758
to think about
what you could cost me?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.927
This could ruin
my political future.

01:11:42.929 --> 01:11:44.996
Will! I'm talking
about action.

01:11:44.998 --> 01:11:47.631
I have worked too hard
for too long,

01:11:47.633 --> 01:11:49.501
Devil knows, for years.

01:11:51.336 --> 01:11:53.705
Swallowing
the lords' insults,

01:11:53.707 --> 01:11:55.740
<i>them laughing
behind my back,</i>

01:11:55.742 --> 01:11:58.042
so that I can pull myself
up from the gutter

01:11:58.044 --> 01:12:00.777
and get the life I deserve.

01:12:00.779 --> 01:12:03.480
And no one is gonna
bollocks me on this.

01:12:03.482 --> 01:12:04.883
Not even you.

01:12:06.618 --> 01:12:08.285
You're scared.

01:12:08.287 --> 01:12:09.519
What?

01:12:09.521 --> 01:12:11.757
<i>You think that
if the commoners do rise up,</i>

01:12:13.058 --> 01:12:15.424
if they fight,

01:12:15.426 --> 01:12:16.862
<i>you'll lose them.</i>

01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:20.564
They'll follow the Hood.

01:12:20.566 --> 01:12:21.700
<i>All right, men!</i>

01:12:22.567 --> 01:12:24.235
You know what to do.

01:12:26.471 --> 01:12:27.772
Move!

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:47.857
As of right now

01:12:47.859 --> 01:12:51.961
these mines are declared
part of Nottingham.

01:12:51.963 --> 01:12:53.796
On whose authority?

01:12:53.798 --> 01:12:57.099
Everybody
will pay what they owe

01:12:57.101 --> 01:12:58.635
for the war effort.

01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:06.309
Refusal will be counted
as treason.

01:13:10.047 --> 01:13:12.579
No! Please!
No, no! Please!

01:13:12.581 --> 01:13:13.583
I've done nothing wrong!

01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:14.851
Mercy!

01:13:21.725 --> 01:13:22.990
Penny!

01:13:22.992 --> 01:13:23.993
Stay back!

01:13:32.936 --> 01:13:34.004
Call yourself a man?

01:13:39.642 --> 01:13:41.777
Oh, I'm gonna
have fun with you later.

01:13:47.482 --> 01:13:49.482
We're too late.
There are too many of them.

01:13:49.484 --> 01:13:50.485
What? For you and me?

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:53.020
There's not enough.

01:13:56.892 --> 01:13:58.158
They've got Marian!

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.861
No!

01:14:02.564 --> 01:14:03.796
Let me out!

01:14:03.798 --> 01:14:05.333
Let me out!

01:14:06.634 --> 01:14:08.601
Let me out!

01:14:08.603 --> 01:14:09.736
You take the front,
I've got the back.

01:14:09.738 --> 01:14:10.905
Wait. How you gonna...

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:14.475
Oh, that is clever.

01:14:22.117 --> 01:14:23.985
Hyah. Hyah.

01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:27.055
Hyah.

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:29.889
There's the one I want.

01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:31.891
It's Gisbourne!
Turn! Turn!

01:14:31.893 --> 01:14:32.959
Ah! Hold on!

01:14:32.961 --> 01:14:33.962
Move!

01:14:35.195 --> 01:14:36.396
Hyah!

01:14:38.732 --> 01:14:40.434
I want him alive!

01:14:41.169 --> 01:14:42.436
Hyah.

01:14:47.707 --> 01:14:48.876
Hyah.

01:14:49.743 --> 01:14:50.744
Hold on!

01:14:54.047 --> 01:14:55.616
Let me out!

01:15:00.486 --> 01:15:01.554
Hyah.

01:15:03.924 --> 01:15:05.025
Hyah.

01:15:12.798 --> 01:15:14.598
Get me out!

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.002
- Get me out of here!
- Keep it steady!

01:15:17.103 --> 01:15:19.772
John, keep it steady!

01:15:25.577 --> 01:15:26.877
Rob!

01:15:26.879 --> 01:15:28.012
How did you know it was me?

01:15:28.014 --> 01:15:30.080
You call that a disguise?

01:15:30.082 --> 01:15:31.984
Well, it fooled
everybody else.

01:15:35.153 --> 01:15:36.788
- I'm not everyone else!
- Watch out!

01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:40.990
Why didn't you tell me?

01:15:40.992 --> 01:15:43.027
Are we really
going to do this now?

01:15:43.029 --> 01:15:44.130
Get down!

01:15:47.498 --> 01:15:48.665
We've got trouble!

01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:50.035
After them!

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:56.775
Hold it!

01:16:11.288 --> 01:16:12.623
Hyah.

01:17:04.107 --> 01:17:05.274
Follow me!

01:17:13.048 --> 01:17:14.616
There he is!

01:17:20.023 --> 01:17:21.024
Go slow!

01:18:04.398 --> 01:18:05.632
Hyah.

01:18:15.975 --> 01:18:17.644
Shoot his horse!

01:18:47.706 --> 01:18:49.208
Jump!

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:03.987
Are you okay?
Marian?

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:04.990
Yeah.

01:19:09.761 --> 01:19:12.728
You and Marian.
Finish it.

01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:14.830
No, John! Wait!

01:19:14.832 --> 01:19:16.699
- Go! Get out of here!
- John, wait!

01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:18.403
- We have to go! Now!
- No, John, wait, John!

01:19:22.074 --> 01:19:24.008
- John, no!
- We have to go now!

01:19:51.801 --> 01:19:53.335
You okay?

01:19:53.337 --> 01:19:54.836
I'm done.

01:19:54.838 --> 01:19:56.771
We're finished.

01:19:56.773 --> 01:19:58.042
No.

01:19:59.876 --> 01:20:01.976
It's not lost unless
you walk away now.

01:20:01.978 --> 01:20:05.079
It's all John. He's the one
who dragged me into this.

01:20:05.081 --> 01:20:06.881
He chose you for a reason.

01:20:06.883 --> 01:20:08.316
- What reason?
- Find him.

01:20:08.318 --> 01:20:10.117
I want him alive!

01:20:10.119 --> 01:20:13.120
All I wanted
was to get you back.

01:20:13.122 --> 01:20:16.393
Maybe that's how it started,
but it's bigger than that now.

01:20:18.428 --> 01:20:20.230
I'm not who you think I am.

01:20:21.932 --> 01:20:23.966
The Hood's just a disguise.

01:20:25.234 --> 01:20:26.735
I know you.

01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:30.940
Loxley is the disguise.

01:20:38.013 --> 01:20:42.082
In the mines, there's a
thing called a firedamp,

01:20:42.084 --> 01:20:45.120
when a single spark
sets the air on fire.

01:20:48.357 --> 01:20:50.426
That's what you are
for the people.

01:20:52.428 --> 01:20:54.127
Me?

01:20:54.129 --> 01:20:57.799
If not you, who?

01:21:00.935 --> 01:21:03.104
If not now, when?

01:21:06.307 --> 01:21:08.375
The sheriff,
he and the cardinal,

01:21:08.377 --> 01:21:09.976
they're in league
with the Arabians somehow.

01:21:09.978 --> 01:21:11.446
Yeah. I might have proof.

01:21:14.182 --> 01:21:15.381
If the people knew...

01:21:15.383 --> 01:21:16.783
If the people knew,
they'd fight.

01:21:21.122 --> 01:21:22.956
With the right leader.

01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:40.307
If you want me
to give up the thief,

01:21:42.309 --> 01:21:45.578
at least give me
the respect and try

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.347
and beat it out of me.

01:21:48.315 --> 01:21:50.248
No.

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:53.019
You'd just die on me
out of spite.

01:21:55.322 --> 01:21:58.389
Humans are the only species
that fear death.

01:21:58.391 --> 01:22:02.960
Not just the threat of it,
but its finality.

01:22:02.962 --> 01:22:08.265
That's what separates us from
the insects and the dogs.

01:22:08.267 --> 01:22:11.135
The Arab, however,
doesn't fear death at all

01:22:11.137 --> 01:22:16.173
because your false prophet
promised you the garden.

01:22:16.175 --> 01:22:19.043
A man without faith.

01:22:19.045 --> 01:22:20.177
Lonely.

01:22:20.179 --> 01:22:22.045
Liberating.

01:22:22.047 --> 01:22:24.949
Without judgment, no sin.

01:22:25.651 --> 01:22:27.052
Faith.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:31.524
We stare death in the face
with courage and honor.

01:22:32.325 --> 01:22:33.890
Really?

01:22:33.892 --> 01:22:36.092
Because I was told

01:22:36.094 --> 01:22:38.897
that your boy begged

01:22:40.332 --> 01:22:41.497
for his life

01:22:41.499 --> 01:22:43.534
right up until the moment

01:22:43.536 --> 01:22:46.170
that we took his head
from his neck.

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:50.340
Decapitation's a funny thing

01:22:50.342 --> 01:22:54.544
because the eyes keep seeing.

01:22:54.546 --> 01:22:58.413
The mind goes on
trying to deny death.

01:22:58.415 --> 01:23:01.016
Even if it's just
for a few more moments.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:04.353
But I wonder what your
son might have been

01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:06.188
thinking in those
final seconds.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.192
I imagine it to be
something like, "Father.

01:23:09.194 --> 01:23:11.293
"Why have you
brought me to this place?

01:23:11.295 --> 01:23:12.427
"Father, I'm scared.

01:23:12.429 --> 01:23:14.596
"Father, why
don't you save me?"

01:23:18.635 --> 01:23:21.470
If you don't give me
the thief's name,

01:23:21.472 --> 01:23:24.673
I will gorge you
with pig's blood

01:23:24.675 --> 01:23:26.541
and I will burn you

01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:30.345
and you will
never see paradise.

01:23:30.347 --> 01:23:32.947
But if you do
give me his name,

01:23:32.949 --> 01:23:34.682
I'll martyr you
quickly, cleanly.

01:23:34.684 --> 01:23:36.018
You will join your boy.

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:40.056
Sheriff!

01:23:41.324 --> 01:23:44.058
Oh, I'm glad
your faith is so strong.

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.961
It's gonna make breaking it
so much sweeter.

01:23:47.963 --> 01:23:49.663
I'm a killer.

01:23:49.665 --> 01:23:53.200
I was born into this war.

01:23:53.202 --> 01:23:55.202
But I've never met a man
who had his killing

01:23:55.204 --> 01:23:58.471
coming as much as you do.

01:23:58.473 --> 01:24:00.440
You're gonna wanna
believe in a god.

01:24:00.442 --> 01:24:02.242
You're gonna
want to see His face

01:24:02.244 --> 01:24:05.111
and think that something
can save you.

01:24:05.113 --> 01:24:07.248
But you'll see my face.

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:09.419
And that's
the last thing you'll see.

01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:31.206
Will.

01:24:32.674 --> 01:24:34.206
Mr. Tillman.
Everyone's ready.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:36.108
Thanks, Penny.

01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:37.209
What's happening?

01:24:37.211 --> 01:24:38.612
We're leaving the mines.

01:24:40.749 --> 01:24:44.049
What happened last night
will happen again and again,

01:24:44.051 --> 01:24:45.418
they will keep on coming.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.552
I know these people.

01:24:46.554 --> 01:24:49.788
Let 'em come back and kill
us all, I am not running!

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:52.524
Listen, I hear you, but we
cannot plan when we panic.

01:24:52.526 --> 01:24:53.692
She's right, Will.

01:24:53.694 --> 01:24:55.194
We should stay and fight.

01:24:55.196 --> 01:24:56.363
With what?

01:24:57.064 --> 01:24:58.664
Picks and shovels?

01:24:58.666 --> 01:25:02.033
The city is in lockdown.
It is martial law.

01:25:02.035 --> 01:25:04.670
Look, we can die as prisoners

01:25:04.672 --> 01:25:06.103
or we can
fall back and live.

01:25:06.105 --> 01:25:08.273
You've got
another choice.

01:25:12.312 --> 01:25:14.345
We can make
our own choices.

01:25:14.347 --> 01:25:16.280
All your thievery has done

01:25:16.282 --> 01:25:19.417
is drive the sheriff
to declare war on us.

01:25:19.419 --> 01:25:21.587
You have no voice here.

01:25:21.589 --> 01:25:23.423
Then
I'll show you my face.

01:25:35.634 --> 01:25:38.401
Are we supposed
to be impressed?

01:25:38.403 --> 01:25:41.672
The good Lord of Loxley
has come down from on high

01:25:41.674 --> 01:25:44.609
to tell us, the peasants,
what to do?

01:25:44.611 --> 01:25:45.710
Well, let me
tell you something.

01:25:45.712 --> 01:25:46.810
This is not your manor.

01:25:46.812 --> 01:25:48.012
Let him talk.

01:25:59.123 --> 01:26:01.257
Four years ago,

01:26:01.259 --> 01:26:05.029
I marched off to fight
for a liar's cause.

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.599
Left my heart,

01:26:09.601 --> 01:26:11.702
came home
an heir to nothing.

01:26:13.271 --> 01:26:14.203
The question is

01:26:14.205 --> 01:26:17.807
what would you do
to get back what's yours?

01:26:17.809 --> 01:26:19.509
I'm guessing
you'd be up for

01:26:19.511 --> 01:26:21.545
a little redistribution
of wealth?

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.346
Well, the sheriff
has already

01:26:24.348 --> 01:26:25.681
rinsed us
for everything we have.

01:26:25.683 --> 01:26:27.216
The sheriff
and the cardinal are

01:26:27.218 --> 01:26:29.118
plotting against England
with the enemy.

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.519
Now, I don't know
what their scheme is,

01:26:30.521 --> 01:26:31.754
but I'm willing to bet that

01:26:31.756 --> 01:26:33.789
it's your money
bankrolling it.

01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:36.692
Money which is due
to set sail to Arabia

01:26:36.694 --> 01:26:38.694
in three days.

01:26:38.696 --> 01:26:40.763
But not if we stop them.

01:26:47.704 --> 01:26:50.873
Some say I rob from the
rich and give to the poor.

01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:52.875
But if the rich
are stealing from you,

01:26:52.877 --> 01:26:55.143
who's really the thief?

01:26:55.145 --> 01:26:58.245
I was Robin of Loxley,

01:26:58.247 --> 01:27:01.683
a Crusader under the flag
of the King of England.

01:27:01.685 --> 01:27:03.386
Then I was the Hood.

01:27:05.455 --> 01:27:06.788
Now, I really don't care

01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:09.890
what you call me,
thief or lord.

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:12.762
All I know is I'm nothing
without your help.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.798
This is our crusade!

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.801
And each and every one of us
has to stand up

01:27:19.803 --> 01:27:22.404
or we all go under.

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:28.243
I say we go with him!

01:27:33.182 --> 01:27:35.651
Look, people,
listen. People!

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.686
We need to be
thinking practically.

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:42.823
Where are we going to eat?
How can we find shelter?

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:44.493
I couldn't say this
to you before,

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.326
but I know what you've
done for these people.

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:48.663
I know why
they look up to you.

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:50.529
What happens next

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:52.735
doesn't happen at all
without you, Will.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.522
Tuck! Back at the party,

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:17.823
I couldn't think
of another way

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.425
to get you out of there.
I'm sorry.

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:20.493
Don't be.

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:23.430
Tuck! I got you defrocked.

01:28:24.398 --> 01:28:25.899
Yes, you did.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.667
You set me free.

01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:32.439
Now, come, come. We have
the devil's work to undo.

01:28:34.573 --> 01:28:38.342
10,000 gold nobles
paid to an Arabic general

01:28:38.344 --> 01:28:40.745
authorized by
the Sheriff of Nottingham...

01:28:40.747 --> 01:28:45.483
20,000, 40... These payments
go back years and years.

01:28:45.485 --> 01:28:47.685
And if they get that
money, we're all finished.

01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:48.854
Not if we stop them.

01:28:51.557 --> 01:28:52.456
Here it was me thinking

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:54.828
you were just
the humble friar, Tuck.

01:28:55.529 --> 01:28:56.961
Yeah, well...

01:28:56.963 --> 01:28:58.062
After the money
leaves the treasury,

01:28:58.064 --> 01:29:00.564
it's going to stop at
the cathedral to be blessed

01:29:00.566 --> 01:29:02.766
before it's handed over
to the cardinal's men.

01:29:02.768 --> 01:29:04.468
Well, then,
that's where we hit it.

01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:06.603
The sheriff will have all
his Crossmen on that convoy.

01:29:06.605 --> 01:29:08.439
A legion of them, no doubt.

01:29:08.441 --> 01:29:10.440
Elite killers
armed to the teeth,

01:29:10.442 --> 01:29:11.875
and the city streets
on lockdown,

01:29:11.877 --> 01:29:14.011
so you can forget about
the element of surprise.

01:29:14.013 --> 01:29:16.547
We'll be lambs
to the slaughter. This is...

01:29:16.549 --> 01:29:19.416
Suicide, yeah, we get it.

01:29:19.418 --> 01:29:22.353
What do you say to that,
then, soldier?

01:29:24.422 --> 01:29:26.924
Set up a meeting
at Loxley Manor.

01:29:26.926 --> 01:29:28.359
<i>Everyone who's with us.</i>

01:29:33.398 --> 01:29:34.498
Rob.

01:29:35.066 --> 01:29:36.601
Everyone's here.

01:29:54.351 --> 01:29:55.452
Here's the plan.

01:30:14.437 --> 01:30:15.839
Three more
on that side!

01:30:18.575 --> 01:30:20.809
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful with it.

01:30:24.347 --> 01:30:25.846
One more hood. Hood.

01:30:27.617 --> 01:30:29.084
- Two hoods coming up.
- Here!

01:30:29.086 --> 01:30:30.620
Who else needs a hood?

01:30:41.597 --> 01:30:43.964
As long as
he is uncaught,

01:30:43.966 --> 01:30:45.732
my money's not safe!

01:30:45.734 --> 01:30:48.002
Now did you leave your balls

01:30:48.004 --> 01:30:50.971
for this kind of work
in the desert, did you?

01:30:50.973 --> 01:30:55.810
I want his blood flooding
the streets of Nottingham...

01:30:55.812 --> 01:30:58.678
<i>I want the rats
swimming in it.</i>

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:02.916
<i>I want the dogs licking it
from the streets.</i>

01:31:02.918 --> 01:31:06.454
<i>My life rides on that wagon.</i>

01:32:47.953 --> 01:32:49.021
Ready for this, Will?

01:32:53.258 --> 01:32:56.793
A thousand pounds for
the man who brings me Hood!

01:32:56.795 --> 01:33:00.098
One of these bastards
knows who he is!

01:33:10.241 --> 01:33:11.441
This is it!

01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:54.651
Throw it, Will!

01:33:56.786 --> 01:33:58.087
Throw it!

01:34:33.588 --> 01:34:34.622
Where is he?

01:34:36.158 --> 01:34:37.692
Where is the Hood?

01:34:53.841 --> 01:34:55.877
Get me through
that goddamned fire!

01:35:07.355 --> 01:35:08.988
Was that supposed
to happen?

01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:10.755
Yeah, of course.

01:35:10.757 --> 01:35:12.726
You, form up!

01:35:43.656 --> 01:35:46.225
They're
taking my money!

01:35:49.328 --> 01:35:50.796
- Kill them!
- Marian!

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:01.673
Look away.

01:36:02.707 --> 01:36:03.742
Never.

01:36:25.897 --> 01:36:27.230
Get down there!

01:36:27.232 --> 01:36:28.397
Get down there now!

01:36:30.369 --> 01:36:32.935
Gisbourne. Down there!

01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:49.820
Lord Loxley.

01:37:10.273 --> 01:37:11.941
We don't have to do this.

01:37:13.443 --> 01:37:16.810
- Kill me. Kill me, Loxley.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

01:37:16.812 --> 01:37:18.246
You saved my life
back in the desert.

01:37:18.248 --> 01:37:19.414
I'm not gonna
take yours now.

01:37:19.416 --> 01:37:22.016
I am God's true soldier,
Loxley.

01:37:22.018 --> 01:37:23.753
I deserve a...

01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:28.425
He had it coming.

01:37:35.998 --> 01:37:37.830
- Give me a hand there.
- Get it to the forest.

01:37:37.832 --> 01:37:38.866
- Be safe.
- Aye.

01:37:38.868 --> 01:37:42.136
Go, guys! Move, move, move!
Come on! Let's go!

01:37:42.138 --> 01:37:43.871
Where's Will?
He should be here by now.

01:37:43.873 --> 01:37:45.939
He knows the plan.
We need to go.

01:37:45.941 --> 01:37:47.907
I'm going back for him.
You go with them.

01:37:47.909 --> 01:37:49.976
You're the most wanted man
in Nottingham.

01:37:49.978 --> 01:37:51.844
Going back is suicide.

01:37:51.846 --> 01:37:53.748
Either we all make it
or none of us do.

01:38:09.364 --> 01:38:10.829
Tuck! Tuck!

01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:12.030
Tuck,
have you seen Will?

01:38:12.032 --> 01:38:13.832
He was meant to be
on the boat with you.

01:38:13.834 --> 01:38:15.237
Will!

01:38:18.039 --> 01:38:19.107
Will!

01:38:19.975 --> 01:38:21.106
It's okay.

01:38:21.108 --> 01:38:22.109
I know!

01:38:24.912 --> 01:38:26.481
I saw!

01:38:27.147 --> 01:38:28.483
He can have you.

01:38:29.883 --> 01:38:31.151
Get out of my sight!

01:38:32.052 --> 01:38:32.853
Go!

01:38:34.455 --> 01:38:36.955
I'll get him
back to the manor.

01:38:36.957 --> 01:38:38.056
Get everyone
out of here.

01:38:38.058 --> 01:38:39.927
- What about you?
- Just go!

01:39:02.982 --> 01:39:03.983
Rob!

01:39:09.888 --> 01:39:13.124
Stop! Stop fighting!

01:39:13.126 --> 01:39:15.861
The man you're
hunting for is me!

01:39:16.296 --> 01:39:18.129
No more running.

01:39:18.131 --> 01:39:19.497
No more hiding.

01:39:19.499 --> 01:39:23.333
And if sacrificing myself
stops this madness,

01:39:23.335 --> 01:39:24.803
here I am!

01:39:25.937 --> 01:39:26.938
Get off me!

01:39:37.649 --> 01:39:39.482
My city
is under siege.

01:39:39.484 --> 01:39:43.286
Is there literally nothing
else you could be doing?

01:39:56.535 --> 01:39:58.836
Loxley.

01:40:04.108 --> 01:40:07.377
You've put me
to a lot of trouble, boy.

01:40:07.379 --> 01:40:10.579
Oh, your troubles have
only just begun, sheriff!

01:40:10.581 --> 01:40:14.552
Everyone will know of your
treason and the cardinal's.

01:40:16.087 --> 01:40:17.986
What do you think
the crown will do

01:40:17.988 --> 01:40:20.124
when it finds out
you're a traitor?

01:40:20.491 --> 01:40:22.423
Huh?

01:40:22.425 --> 01:40:24.861
Do you think they'll
just take off your head?

01:40:26.364 --> 01:40:28.965
Or will they give you
the broomstick first?

01:40:48.518 --> 01:40:51.352
Now I'm going to boil you
in your own piss,

01:40:51.354 --> 01:40:54.255
and then I'm going
to send Marian off

01:40:54.257 --> 01:40:56.624
to be bred
by savages in Arabia

01:40:56.626 --> 01:40:59.694
again, and again, and again.

01:41:09.036 --> 01:41:11.003
Look at me!
Look in my eyes!

01:41:11.005 --> 01:41:12.239
Please, God.

01:41:12.241 --> 01:41:14.643
God isn't here,
it's just me!

01:41:26.053 --> 01:41:28.624
You bastard,
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham!

01:41:29.324 --> 01:41:30.426
Not anymore.

01:41:41.537 --> 01:41:43.705
You are a hard man
to kill, John.

01:41:45.071 --> 01:41:47.073
And I thank God for it.

01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:56.115
Daylight. Daylight ahead.

01:41:56.117 --> 01:41:57.515
Okay, everybody...

01:41:57.517 --> 01:42:00.418
I know you're tired,
but let's keep moving...

01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:02.655
I wanna get us
under cover by nightfall.

01:42:02.657 --> 01:42:04.657
I'll see you in Sherwood.

01:42:04.659 --> 01:42:06.659
I'll see you there.

01:42:06.661 --> 01:42:10.228
And this does make us outlaws,
so if anybody wants out,

01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:12.530
well, it's probably too late.

01:42:12.532 --> 01:42:14.132
Here, let me
help you with that.

01:42:14.134 --> 01:42:15.333
Get going.

01:42:15.335 --> 01:42:20.171
I'm actually quite giddy
to find myself an outlaw.

01:42:20.173 --> 01:42:23.575
It's the most exciting thing
that's happened to me since,

01:42:23.577 --> 01:42:26.611
well, come
to think of it, ever.

01:42:26.613 --> 01:42:31.149
You know, when I was
back in the desert,

01:42:31.151 --> 01:42:34.284
all I thought about was coming
back here and being with you.

01:42:34.286 --> 01:42:36.119
Sitting in our manor,

01:42:36.121 --> 01:42:39.358
eating and drinking
and not doing very much.

01:42:40.527 --> 01:42:42.760
And now we're fugitives,

01:42:42.762 --> 01:42:44.763
and me the leader
of a revolution.

01:42:46.699 --> 01:42:48.200
Didn't see it coming.

01:42:49.535 --> 01:42:50.569
I did.

01:42:55.674 --> 01:42:57.507
It's a nice forest.

01:42:57.509 --> 01:43:00.276
We haven't officially met.
I'm Tuck, by the way.

01:43:00.278 --> 01:43:02.679
Yahya ibn Umar.

01:43:02.681 --> 01:43:04.113
Phew.

01:43:04.115 --> 01:43:05.716
Would you mind
if I just translate it?

01:43:05.718 --> 01:43:07.353
Call you John?

01:43:09.687 --> 01:43:11.689
<i>Feels like
a perfect ending, doesn't it?</i>

01:43:12.423 --> 01:43:13.691
<i>But it's not.</i>

01:43:14.626 --> 01:43:17.260
<i>Fate plays its part.</i>

01:43:17.262 --> 01:43:21.397
<i>And it's the way of things
that as one story ends...</i>

01:43:21.399 --> 01:43:24.300
<i>another begins.</i>

01:43:24.302 --> 01:43:28.704
I am very glad
to have found you.

01:43:28.706 --> 01:43:33.708
You have sacrificed so much,
but your people need you

01:43:33.710 --> 01:43:40.315
to lead them out of this
dark time and into the light.

01:43:40.317 --> 01:43:42.654
I am offering you
an appointment

01:43:43.888 --> 01:43:47.656
to the highest office
in Nottingham.

01:43:47.658 --> 01:43:50.191
If you accept,

01:43:50.193 --> 01:43:53.664
you will have the church's
eternal gratitude.

01:43:54.899 --> 01:43:56.531
And mine.

01:43:59.603 --> 01:44:02.136
<i>My city, my people,</i>

01:44:02.138 --> 01:44:03.638
in the day
since the thief

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.440
and his partners and raiders

01:44:05.442 --> 01:44:07.509
have been hunted
into hiding,

01:44:07.511 --> 01:44:10.210
we have laid to rest
our good sheriff.

01:44:10.212 --> 01:44:12.279
Yet Nottingham
still smolders

01:44:12.281 --> 01:44:14.350
from the fires
of their revolt.

01:44:15.184 --> 01:44:17.184
My baptism was one of fire,

01:44:17.186 --> 01:44:20.354
but I am grateful
for its cause.

01:44:20.356 --> 01:44:23.490
