00:12.311 --> 00:14.312
NO, SEE,
YOUR BROTHER KNEW ALL ALONG

00:14.314 --> 00:16.247
THAT YOU STOLE
YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE SAVINGS.

00:16.248 --> 00:17.666
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

00:17.668 --> 00:20.468
AND YOU LET JULIE THINK
THAT YOUR MOTHER KILLED HERSELF

00:20.470 --> 00:21.536
BECAUSE OF THE MONEY.

00:21.538 --> 00:23.738
YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T COMMIT
SUICIDE.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.840
WE...

00:25.842 --> 00:27.042
CHECKED THE PRESCRIPTIONS.

00:27.044 --> 00:28.176
IT'S IN YOUR DOCTOR'S NAME,

HOW COULD YOU?

00:35.569 --> 00:40.054
[Julie screams,

00:42.959 --> 00:45.494
NICE JOB,
YOU TWO.

00:45.496 --> 00:46.962
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH THE PAPERWORK,

00:46.964 --> 00:48.663
TAKE A DAY.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.467
GO.
ARE YOU SURE?

00:55.004 --> 00:58.990
MY MOM DIED
LAST YEAR.

00:58.992 --> 01:02.427
AND THERE ARE THINGS
I NEVER GOT TO SAY TO HER.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.028
AND, UM...

01:05.965 --> 01:09.835
TODAY'S HER BIRTHDAY.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.638
AND A BIG PART OF ME
WANTS TO PICK UP AND FORGET.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.706
YOU KNOW.

01:14.708 --> 01:18.676
<i>BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.</i>

01:18.678 --> 01:22.246

02:10.396 --> 02:12.630

EVELYN,

WHO WAS JUST HERE,

02:45.732 --> 02:47.131
SHE LEFT THIS FOR YOU.

02:52.571 --> 02:53.671

IN HIS POCKET.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.902
THINK THERE'S MORE
TO THE STORY?

06:27.904 --> 06:29.204
BROTHER HAD ENEMIES?

06:29.206 --> 06:32.039
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS A...

06:32.041 --> 06:34.759
GAMBLER AND A...

06:34.761 --> 06:38.980
JUNKIE FOR, YOU KNOW,

06:38.982 --> 06:41.666
30 YEARS.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.651

SOME ENEMIES.

<i>(Fontanella) ANY NAMES?</i>

06:45.855 --> 06:47.404
I DON'T KNOW.

06:47.406 --> 06:50.058
I DIDN'T KEEP IN TOUCH.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.543
SO, WHAT, YOU JUST DECIDED
TO SHOW UP THIS MORNING?

06:56.398 --> 06:57.282
UH...

06:59.251 --> 07:01.585
YESTERDAY
WAS MY MOM'S BIRTHDAY.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.571
SHE PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR.

07:03.573 --> 07:06.573
SO YOU'RE THE ONLY FAMILY?

07:07.809 --> 07:10.745
HE'S GOT A SON,
DONNY, SORRY.

07:13.432 --> 07:16.017
BUT THE KID RAN AWAY
FROM HIM.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.318
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE KID IS.

07:36.288 --> 07:37.388
THANKS.

07:41.342 --> 07:45.229
FRANKIE NEVER BLAMED HIMSELF
FOR ANYTHING.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.348
HE DIRECTED HIS ANGER OUT,
NOT IN.

07:50.018 --> 07:52.670
WHERE DID HE GET
THE $800 FROM?

07:55.207 --> 07:58.126
COULD HE HAVE WON IT
AT THE TRACK OR GAMBLING?

07:58.128 --> 08:00.528
YEAH.

08:00.530 --> 08:02.296
YEAH, HE COULD HAVE.

08:13.309 --> 08:15.609
I'LL TALK
TO THE CAPTAIN.

08:15.611 --> 08:18.263
WE'LL MAKE SURE
THEY DO A REAL INVESTIGATION.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.214
YOU'LL BE AT ARMS LENGTH.

08:20.216 --> 08:23.151
BUT I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

08:23.153 --> 08:25.586
NO FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.987
NOTHING IN THE CUPBOARDS.

08:26.989 --> 08:28.456
NOT EVEN ROACHES.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.892
CAPTAIN, I CAN HANDLE IT
IF YOU HAVE TO GET BACK.

08:31.894 --> 08:34.061
NO, I WANT TO.

08:34.063 --> 08:36.996
FIRST, HIS MOTHER,
THEN HIS BROTHER.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.167
IT'S A LOT
TO LOSE.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.635
WELL, I'VE GOT
AN N.A. MEETING SCHEDULE.

08:44.706 --> 08:46.558
LOOKS LIKE FRANK HAD
A MEETING YESTERDAY.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.643
GUESS IT DIDN'T TAKE.

08:49.645 --> 08:50.979
MM.

08:50.981 --> 08:54.849
"EVELYN, COFFEE,
9:30, PORT AUTHORITY."

08:54.851 --> 08:56.467
MAYBE A PROGRAM DATE.

08:58.804 --> 09:01.773
MAYBE MORE THAN THAT.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.525
CSU'S BAGGING
SOME EFFECTS.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.494
FRANK'S N.A. SCHEDULE.

09:06.496 --> 09:09.463
HE MIGHT HAVE SET UP COFFEE
WITH SOMEONE AFTER THE MEETING.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.032
EVELYN.

09:11.034 --> 09:14.002
IT COULD BE EVELYN CARSON,
DONNY'S MOTHER.

09:14.004 --> 09:15.003
(Evelyn) I CAME TO THE CITY

09:15.005 --> 09:17.271
BECAUSE FRANK CALLED ME.

09:17.273 --> 09:20.774
HE TOLD ME MY SON NEEDED MONEY
FOR A LAWYER.

09:20.776 --> 09:23.544
I WAS HOPING...

09:23.546 --> 09:26.481
I HAVEN'T SEEN DONNY
IN ALMOST A YEAR.

09:28.317 --> 09:31.886
I WISH THAT YOU HAD TAKEN MORE
OF AN INTEREST IN YOUR NEPHEW.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.303
AN INTEREST?

09:33.305 --> 09:35.023
<i>FRANK SAID</i>
<i>HE REACHED OUT TO YOU FOR HELP,</i>

09:35.025 --> 09:37.024
BUT YOU COULDN'T.

09:37.026 --> 09:40.528
OR WOULDN'T.

09:40.530 --> 09:41.779
HOW MUCH MONEY
DID YOU GIVE FRANK?

09:41.781 --> 09:43.615
$800.

09:43.617 --> 09:48.069
FRANK ALWAYS KNEW WHAT TO SAY
WHEN HE WANTED SOMETHING.

09:48.071 --> 09:51.956
YEAH. SOMETIMES HE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO SPEAK.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.024
THERE WAS THIS WOMAN
AT THE COFFEE SHOP.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.826
SHE LEFT HIM
HER NUMBER.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.395
HE DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK
TO HER.

10:00.231 --> 10:02.466
HE COULD STILL PULL
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.335
A WOMAN?
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HER?

10:04.337 --> 10:05.670
BLONDE.
AVERAGE HEIGHT.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.838
I DIDN'T GET A GREAT LOOK
AT HER.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.959
AFTER YOU HAD COFFEE...

10:11.961 --> 10:13.628
<i>OH, HE WALKED ME TO THE BUS.</i>

10:13.630 --> 10:15.530
<i>SAID HE WAS GOING HOME.</i>

10:15.532 --> 10:18.365
<i>I GUESS HE NEVER FIGURED OUT</i>
<i>WHAT TO DO FOR YOUR MOTHER.</i>

10:18.367 --> 10:20.184
HE LEFT A PICTURE
AT HER GRAVE.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.887
OH.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.889
SO HE DID GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU?

10:25.908 --> 10:28.709
HE SAID HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE SHE WAS BURIED.

10:39.955 --> 10:43.157
COFFEE SHOP REMEMBERED
THE BLONDE.

10:43.159 --> 10:45.092
ORDERED TEA.
PAID CASH.

10:45.094 --> 10:47.728
CASHIER'S WORKING
WITH THE SKETCH ARTIST.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.799
AND LATENT DIDN'T FIND
ANY PRINTS OTHER THAN YOURS.

10:51.801 --> 10:55.053
THIS, UH, FRAME...

10:55.055 --> 10:58.872
IT HONORS THE PICTURE...
THE MEMORY.

10:58.874 --> 11:01.976
MY BROTHER,
HE'S NOT THOUGHTFUL.

11:01.978 --> 11:06.113
HE TACKS HIS PHOTOS
TO THE WALL WITH PUSHPINS.

11:13.121 --> 11:16.121
<i>(Eames) THE AUTOPSY'S BACK.</i>

11:17.493 --> 11:21.595
<i>(Rodgers)</i>
<i>LACERATIONS ARE FROM THE FALL.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:25.966
WE FOUND SPERM
IN HIS URETHRA AND TRACE SALIVA.

11:25.968 --> 11:28.669
WE'RE RUNNING THE DNA
ON THAT.

11:28.671 --> 11:30.103
GOOD LUCK.

11:30.105 --> 11:32.373
AND ON THE BLONDE HAIR
FROM HIS BED.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.225
SO HE WASN'T ALONE
WHEN HE FELL OUT THE WINDOW?

11:34.227 --> 11:37.845
HE DIDN'T FALL.

11:37.847 --> 11:39.279
YOUR BROTHER WAS MURDERED.

11:40.899 --> 11:42.400
BESIDES CRACK COCAINE,

11:42.402 --> 11:46.019
THERE WAS SUCCINYLCHOLINE
IN HIS SYSTEM, A PARALYTIC.

11:46.021 --> 11:49.023
RIGHT, WHICH MAKES YOU
STOP BREATHING.

11:51.626 --> 11:53.227
THERE'S AN INJECTION POINT
IN HIS SIDE.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.293
FRANK NEVER USED NEEDLES.
HE WAS AFRAID OF THEM.

12:11.579 --> 12:14.031
SUCCINYLCHOLINE.
MM-HMM.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.032
BLONDE AT THE COFFEE SHOP.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.035
NICOLE WALLACE.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.971
SHE CAME
AFTER MY BROTHER.

12:36.054 --> 12:39.323
<i>ALL RIGHTY.</i>

12:39.325 --> 12:41.075
<i>ONE LIKE THIS'LL BE</i>
<i>IN PHOENIX TOMORROW.</i>

12:41.077 --> 12:42.793
NOW THIS OTHER BOUQUET
IS FOR A POLICE STATION?

12:42.795 --> 12:45.496
UH, YES.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.830
WITH THIS CARD.

12:46.832 --> 12:50.001
FOR TUESDAY DELIVERY.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.336
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.555
IT'S JUST BEEN SO HARD.

12:54.557 --> 12:56.106
YOU DIDN'T SIGN
YOUR CARD.

13:03.882 --> 13:04.982
DON'T THINK FOR ONE SECOND

13:04.984 --> 13:07.652
THAT THIS IS THE END
OF US, BOBBY.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.669
[chuckles]

13:15.860 --> 13:17.728
BOBBY WILL KNOW
WHO IT'S FROM.

13:23.134 --> 13:25.419
<i>(Ross) NICOLE WALLACE.</i>

13:25.421 --> 13:27.204
<i>I'M TOLD</i>
<i>SHE'S YOUR WHITE WHALE?</i>

13:27.206 --> 13:29.840
<i>(Goren) WHEN SHE WAS A
LITERATURE PROFESSOR,</i>

13:29.842 --> 13:31.558
SHE LECTURED ON MELVILLE.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.761
EITHER WAY,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

13:33.763 --> 13:34.611
SHE KILLED YOUR BROTHER?

13:34.613 --> 13:35.879
IT'S WHAT SHE DOES,
CAPTAIN.

13:35.881 --> 13:36.931
SHE SEDUCES,

13:36.933 --> 13:38.082
THEN KILLS.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.267
USUALLY WITH POISON.

13:39.269 --> 13:41.102
<i>(Eames) SHE KILLED MARK BAYLEY,</i>

13:41.104 --> 13:44.421
A GRAD STUDENT,
BY SPIKING HIS GUM.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.223
LARRY CHAPEL,
A HEALTH INSPECTOR,

13:46.225 --> 13:49.560
INJECTED UNDER HIS TONGUE
WITH POTASSIUM CHLORIDE.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.528
AND ZACK THAYLER,
A DIAMOND THIEF,

13:51.530 --> 13:54.932
SUCCINYLCHOLINE INJECTED
IN HIS SIDE.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.285
<i>AND SHE USED</i>
<i>THE SAME METHOD ON MY BROTHER.</i>

13:57.287 --> 13:59.369
SHE KNEW
THAT I WOULD REMEMBER.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.205
<i>BUT THE LAST TIME</i>

14:01.207 --> 14:02.973
YOU SAW HER WAS WHAT?

14:02.975 --> 14:03.974
TWO YEARS AGO?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.609
<i>THREE YEARS AGO.</i>

14:05.611 --> 14:06.660
I CONVINCED HER TO GIVE UP
THE ONLY PERSON

14:06.662 --> 14:07.862
THAT SHE EVER LOVED.

14:07.864 --> 14:09.997
IT WAS A LITTLE, SICK GIRL
NAMED GWEN CHAPEL.

14:09.999 --> 14:13.100
GWEN WAS ALL THAT SHE HAD.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.937
SHE THINKS THAT FRANK IS...

14:16.939 --> 14:18.172
ALL I HAVE.

14:18.174 --> 14:20.123
I'M NOT DOUBTING YOU,
DETECTIVE,

14:20.125 --> 14:22.259
BUT NOW THAT YOUR BROTHER'S
DEATH HAS BEEN RULED A MURDER,

14:22.261 --> 14:25.095
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF NICOLE WAS INVOLVED.

14:25.097 --> 14:27.064
NEITHER OF YOU
CAN GO NEAR THIS.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.566
THEN FORGET THIS CASE.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.467
NICOLE JUMPED BAIL
ON A MURDER CHARGE

14:30.469 --> 14:31.969
THREE YEARS AGO.

14:31.971 --> 14:35.105
OKAY.

14:35.107 --> 14:36.289
<i>TRY TO TRACK HER DOWN</i>

14:36.291 --> 14:38.609
<i>BEFORE THE M.E. MATCHES</i>
<i>HER DNA</i>

14:38.611 --> 14:41.445
TO YOUR BROTHER'S ROOM.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.813
EAMES.

14:48.603 --> 14:49.936
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:49.938 --> 14:53.257
CAPTAIN WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WEREN'T BEING PARANOID.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.959
SHOW HIM THAT.

"OH, THIS IS THE POISON
OF DEEP GRIEF"?

<i>THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHO.</i>

15:12.444 --> 15:13.978
OH.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.513
IT'S MY NEPHEW.
IT'S DONNY.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.232
SHE FOUND HIM.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.004
<i>(Declan) BOBBY?</i>

15:24.006 --> 15:25.873
AH, MY OLD FRIEND.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.107
EASY, EASY, EASY.

15:27.109 --> 15:28.376
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.

15:28.378 --> 15:30.845
[breathing heavily]

15:30.847 --> 15:32.079
FORGIVE ME.

15:32.081 --> 15:35.082
I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO PUT DOWN.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.400
SOMEONE...

15:38.970 --> 15:40.904
BUMPED ME.

15:50.148 --> 15:51.248
HE'S OUT.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.816
DECLAN WAS
AT JOHN JAY.

15:52.818 --> 15:55.886
HE JUST FINISHED A PRESENTATION
ON SERIAL KILLERS.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.022
HIS COLLEAGUES FOUND HIM
COLLAPSED IN A STAIRWELL.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.657
A WITNESS SAW A BLONDE WOMAN
LEAVING THE SCENE.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.991
THAT WAS BESIDE HIM.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.493
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA NEED
A ROUND-THE-CLOCK GUARD ON HIM.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.831
WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE
TO TALK TO HIM?

16:07.833 --> 16:10.067
WE NEED TO FLUSH THE POISON OUT
OF HIS SYSTEM FIRST.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.819
SOME KIND OF PARALYTIC?

16:11.821 --> 16:12.986
YES.

16:12.988 --> 16:15.022
HE WAS FOUND QUICKLY,
BUT GIVEN HIS AGE

16:15.024 --> 16:16.189
AND HIS POOR HEALTH...

16:16.191 --> 16:19.093
HIS HEALTH WAS BAD?

16:19.095 --> 16:21.812
WELL, HE NEVER FULLY RECOVERED
FROM THOSE STOMACH PARASITES

16:21.814 --> 16:23.381
HE PICKED UP LAST WINTER.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.548
I'M SORRY.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.467
I THOUGHT, NEXT OF KIN,
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT.

16:26.469 --> 16:27.718
NO.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.388
NEVER EAT
MONTH-OLD CHRISTMAS GOOSE.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.922
OOH, EXCUSE ME.

16:34.459 --> 16:37.728
THIS SYRINGE,
IT'S ONLY HALF-COMPRESSED.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.480
NICOLE WAS INTERRUPTED.

16:39.482 --> 16:41.749
SHE COULDN'T GIVE HIM
THE FULL DOSE.

16:46.054 --> 16:47.688
MAY I?

16:47.690 --> 16:50.390
WHO ELSE KNOWS
DECLAN'S HERE?

16:53.078 --> 16:56.246
THIS ONE SHE SIGNED.

16:56.248 --> 16:57.948
<i>(Michael) YEAH, THAT'S HER.</i>

16:57.950 --> 17:00.267
SO SAD.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.869
SHE MUST BE GOING
THROUGH QUITE A LOT.

17:01.871 --> 17:03.137
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

17:03.139 --> 17:06.256
FIRST SHE PURCHASED
TWO SYMPATHY BOUQUETS,

17:06.258 --> 17:07.708
PRACTICALLY IN TEARS
THE WHOLE TIME.

17:07.710 --> 17:10.060
THEN SHE EMAILS
AN ORDER

17:10.063 --> 17:12.194
FOR ANOTHER SYMPATHY BOUQUET

17:12.196 --> 17:14.432
TO YOUR FRIEND
AT THE HOSPITAL.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.733
AT BELVEDERE?

17:16.734 --> 17:17.968
RIGHT.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.685
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE OTHER TWO WERE SENT?

17:19.688 --> 17:22.155
ONE TO POLICE PLAZA.

17:22.156 --> 17:23.357
THE OTHER TO PHOENIX.

17:23.358 --> 17:24.775
EXCUSE ME.

17:26.778 --> 17:30.180
PHOENIX, THAT'S WHERE NICOLE
TOOK GWEN CHAPEL.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.649
THE GIRL WAS
AT HIGH RISK FOR CANCER.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.402
I LOVE YOU.

17:35.404 --> 17:38.455
(Goren) GWEN CHAPEL.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.125
THE ONLY PERSON
THAT SHE EVER LOVED.

17:41.127 --> 17:45.462
IF SHE'S DYING, THAT MIGHT BE
WHAT SET NICOLE OFF.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.599
I REMEMBER YOU.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.000
THE NEW YORK DETECTIVES.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.386
NICOLE SAID
YOU MIGHT STOP BY.

17:52.388 --> 17:54.337
SHE CAME TO SEE YOU.

17:54.339 --> 17:57.474
NO, BUT SHE SENT THESE.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.993
WELL, THEY'RE VERY PRETTY.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.413
AND SHE SENT YOU
SOMETHING ELSE?

18:04.882 --> 18:07.467
SHE SENT ME
A GET WELL CARD.

18:07.469 --> 18:09.636
THERE'S A NOTE FOR YOU
INSIDE.

18:13.608 --> 18:15.542
SHE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL
AUNT SUSAN.

18:21.049 --> 18:24.552
(Eames) "TIT FOR TAT.
BLOOD FOR BLOOD."

18:24.554 --> 18:26.803
HOW DID NICOLE
FIND DONNY?

18:28.873 --> 18:30.507
SHE DIDN'T.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.542
NICOLE DOESN'T HAVE DONNY.
[cell phone beeps]

18:32.544 --> 18:35.679
IF SHE DID, SHE WOULD HAVE SENT
A NEW PICTURE OF HIM.

18:37.748 --> 18:40.284
DNA FROM THE HAIR.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.986
IT'S NICOLE'S.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.988
OF COURSE.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.358
SHE LEFT ONE STRAND OF HAIR
THERE ON PURPOSE.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.692
THIS IS JUST A GAME
TO HER.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.560
IT'S THE WORLD CUP.

18:54.115 --> 18:58.318
THIS LETTER IS POSTMARKED
PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.538
NICOLE'S SENDING US
ON A SCAVENGER HUNT.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.457
WHAT'S IN PITTSFIELD?

19:03.459 --> 19:04.908
A WHITE WHALE.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.610
THAT'S WHERE MELVILLE WROTE
<i>MOBY DICK.</i>

19:07.612 --> 19:11.448
THE DESCENT INTO MADNESS
IS USUALLY PRECEDED

19:11.450 --> 19:12.716
BY OBSESSION.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.768
<i>MOBY DICK.</i>

19:14.770 --> 19:17.504
WHAT CHARACTERIZES
AHAB'S OBSESSION?

19:17.506 --> 19:21.041
I ALWAYS FANCIED IT WAS MAN'S
UNRELENTING PURSUIT

19:21.043 --> 19:22.142
OF HIS OWN POTENCY.

19:24.195 --> 19:25.796
WELCOME TO OUR INN.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.297
I'M DETECTIVE EAMES.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.166
I'M DETECTIVE GOREN.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.435
OH, MR. GOREN,
WONDERFUL.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.771
WE HAVE THE HONEYMOON SUITE
READY FOR YOU.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.673
AND YOUR PACKAGE ARRIVED.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.208
I LEFT IT
IN THE ROOM.

19:43.197 --> 19:45.265
WE WERE EXPECTING YOU
EARLIER,

19:45.267 --> 19:46.400
BUT NO WORRIES.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.835
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR WINE AND CHEESE.

19:51.606 --> 19:53.106
COULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE?

20:05.153 --> 20:08.722
IT'S ADDRESSED TO ME
FROM DONNY.

20:15.864 --> 20:17.031
UH, WHY DON'T WE WAIT...

20:27.775 --> 20:30.544
OH, MY GOD.

20:38.569 --> 20:39.969
IT'S DONNY'S HEART.

20:39.971 --> 20:41.338
WHY DON'T WE WAIT
FOR THE M.E. TO...

20:41.340 --> 20:43.206
SHE KILLED MY BROTHER.
SHE WENT AFTER DECLAN.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.508
AND NOW MY NEPHEW.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.842
DETECTIVE.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.877
LOOK...

20:47.879 --> 20:50.380
NICOLE SURVIVED
BY HAVING NO EMOTIONS.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.115
ALL RIGHT.
I MADE HER FEEL.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.201
SELF-DOUBT, SELF-LOATHING.
SHE NEVER FORGAVE ME.

20:54.203 --> 20:56.570
IT'S NOT DONNY'S HEART.

20:56.572 --> 20:59.272
THE DNA WASN'T
A MATCH.

21:01.142 --> 21:03.143
BUT YOU FOUND
A MATCH?

21:03.145 --> 21:04.962
RIGHT?
WHO DID NICOLE KILL?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.163
NO ONE.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.415
THE HEART BELONGED
TO NICOLE WALLACE.

21:08.417 --> 21:11.802
NO, THAT'S NOT HERS.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.270
I RAN THE TESTS
THREE TIMES.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.172
YOU DON'T KNOW HER
LIKE I DO.

21:16.174 --> 21:19.259
I MEAN,
IF ANYONE COULD FAKE THIS...

21:19.261 --> 21:20.660
IT'S HER DNA.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.351
SHE CAN'T HAVE A TWIN?

21:27.353 --> 21:29.269
SHE DOESN'T.

21:29.271 --> 21:31.155
I CHECKED HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE
WITH MELBOURNE.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.439
SHE'S PLAYING US.

21:32.441 --> 21:34.424
<i>(Ross) OR SOMEONE'S
PLAYING YOU, DETECTIVE,</i>

21:34.426 --> 21:36.327
AND THEY KILLED
NICOLE WALLACE.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.112
AND KILLED NICOLE?
SHE'S GOT NINE LIVES.

21:38.114 --> 21:39.947
SHE RAN OUT.

21:39.949 --> 21:41.332
DON'T TAKE THAT SIDE.

21:41.334 --> 21:45.319
THESE TESTS,
THEY CAN HAVE FALSE RESULTS.

21:45.321 --> 21:47.354
YOU KNOW,
NICOLE IS STILL OUT THERE.

21:47.356 --> 21:48.888
SHE'S GOT DONNY.

21:48.890 --> 21:52.092
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE WRONG.
YOU'RE ALL WRONG.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.313
<i>(Ross) I AM SORRY.</i>

21:56.315 --> 21:57.881
HE'S BEEN UNDER...
I KNOW.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.936
EAMES, CAN YOU GIVE US
THE ROOM?

22:05.956 --> 22:07.357
OH, I'LL BE UPSTAIRS.

22:14.816 --> 22:16.750
MY DETECTIVE'S IN TROUBLE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

22:16.752 --> 22:19.319
<i>I'M NOT THREATENING YOU,</i>
<i>ELIZABETH.</i>

22:19.321 --> 22:23.356
I'M TRYING
TO WARN YOU.

22:23.358 --> 22:24.475
GOREN'S VULNERABLE.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.576
HE HAS A TARGET ON HIS BACK.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.677
SO DOES ANYONE
WHO HELPS HIM.

22:29.263 --> 22:32.232
ALL RIGHT,
TWO MONTHS AGO,

22:32.234 --> 22:35.085
GOREN ASKED ME
TO RUN A DNA TEST.

22:35.087 --> 22:40.056
HE HAD ME CHECK HIS DNA
AGAINST MARK FORD BRADY'S.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.392
BRADY?

22:41.394 --> 22:42.542
THE SERIAL KILLER.

22:42.544 --> 22:45.161
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?

22:45.163 --> 22:47.531
OH, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM.

22:51.485 --> 22:54.587
THIS IS THE FIRST
I'M HEARING ABOUT IT.

22:54.589 --> 22:57.824
YOUR PARTNER ACTUALLY BELIEVES
BRADY COULD BE HIS FATHER.

22:57.826 --> 22:59.526
WELL, HE KNOWS
BRADY'S RELATIONSHIP

22:59.528 --> 23:01.878
WITH HIS MOM
CONTINUED AFTER HER MARRIAGE.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.613
<i>AND HE'S LIVED WITH THAT</i>
<i>FOR A YEAR.</i>

23:03.615 --> 23:06.950
NOW HE GETS PATERNITY RESULTS.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.185
SUDDENLY, THIS SPREE BEGINS.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.587
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

23:10.589 --> 23:13.240
THE VICTIMS:
HIS ESTRANGED BROTHER,

23:13.242 --> 23:14.458
HIS FORMER MENTOR...

23:14.460 --> 23:16.827
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO

23:16.829 --> 23:18.962
WITH THESE MURDERS.

23:20.731 --> 23:21.665
THEN RULE HIM OUT.

23:26.654 --> 23:30.891
SO SHE LED YOU
TO HER OWN HEART.

23:30.893 --> 23:32.609
THAT'S WHAT THE M.E.
WANTS ME TO BELIEVE.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.111
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.546
OR MAYBE
YOU JUST CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

23:36.548 --> 23:39.316
YOUR GREATEST NEMESIS
BROUGHT DOWN BY SOMEONE ELSE.

23:42.169 --> 23:43.454
WORKING THEORY:

23:43.456 --> 23:47.223
NICOLE HAD A PARTNER
WHO TURNED ON HER.

23:51.262 --> 23:54.931
YOU MEAN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
HER HISTORY WITH ME?

23:56.517 --> 23:57.551
YOU.

23:59.970 --> 24:01.088
ME.

24:01.090 --> 24:02.238
YOU'RE BEING SET UP.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.274
THEY'RE PROBABLY
ALREADY INVESTIGATING YOU.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.476
LIKE I WAS.

24:05.478 --> 24:08.812
<i>WHEN EAMES WAS KIDNAPPED.</i>

24:08.814 --> 24:11.464
I NEVER BLAMED YOU.
COME ON, MOVE, MOVE.

24:11.466 --> 24:14.100
MY DAUGHTER WAS VERY CLEVER.

24:14.102 --> 24:16.302
COME ON.

24:22.926 --> 24:23.926
HOW'S JO?

24:23.928 --> 24:25.595
SHE'S VERY WELL.
CONSIDERING.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.797
THE IRONY IS WE SPEND MORE TIME
TOGETHER NOW

24:27.799 --> 24:28.931
THAN EVER BEFORE.

24:28.933 --> 24:30.867
SHE'S AN INTRIGUING CASE.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.136
ALL RIGHT.
GO THROUGH YOUR CASE FILES.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.571
IT'S SOMEONE
FROM YOUR PAST.

24:34.573 --> 24:35.805
DON'T RULE ANYONE OUT.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.006
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF,
BOBBY,

24:37.008 --> 24:38.841
WHO BENEFITS
FROM ALL THIS?

24:42.180 --> 24:44.247
GOREN'S IUDs AND CELL RECORDS.

24:44.249 --> 24:48.051
NO CALLS TO PHOENIX
OR PITTSFIELD.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.953
HE'S SMART ENOUGH
TO USE A NO-NAME CELL,

24:49.955 --> 24:52.656
SOMEONE ELSE'S E-MAIL,

24:52.658 --> 24:53.640
JUST A THEORY.

24:53.642 --> 24:55.058
BASED ON NOTHING.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.043
CAPTAIN, I'VE GONE
THROUGH THESE ACCOUNTS

24:57.045 --> 24:58.578
YOU GAVE...

24:58.580 --> 25:02.515
SIMMONS IS TAKING A LOOK
AT GOREN'S FAMILY FINANCES.

25:02.517 --> 25:03.516
<i>(Eames) ASK ME.</i>

25:03.518 --> 25:06.036
GOREN HAD MEDICAL BILLS.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.221
HE WENT SIX MONTHS
WITHOUT A PAYCHECK.

25:08.223 --> 25:09.289
HE'S NOT FLUSH.

25:09.291 --> 25:10.691
SHE'S RIGHT.

25:10.693 --> 25:12.125
HE'S GOT CREDIT UNION LOANS.

25:12.127 --> 25:13.626
HE'S GOT CHARGE CARD DEBT.

25:13.628 --> 25:15.328
HE PAYS THE MINIMUMS.

25:15.330 --> 25:17.647
YOU LOOK
AT LIFE INSURANCE?

25:17.649 --> 25:19.082
UH, NOT YET.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.517
UH, JUST TAKE ONE SECOND
TO RUN THE CHECK.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.287
START WITH FRANK GOREN.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.322
FRANK?

25:25.324 --> 25:26.689
HE LIVED
HAND-TO-MOUTH.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.342
HE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB
OR CREDIT.

25:28.344 --> 25:29.593
<i>HOW COULD HE HAVE</i>
<i>LIFE INSURANCE?</i>

25:29.595 --> 25:31.327
WELL, THIS JUST POPPED UP.

25:31.329 --> 25:34.865
A GEN LIFE POLICY
IN FRANK GOREN'S NAME.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.733
IT'S FOR $500,000.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.018
WHO'S THE BENEFICIARY?

25:39.020 --> 25:43.206
WILLIAM BRADY.

25:50.264 --> 25:52.265
THERE'S AN EXPLANATION.

25:52.267 --> 25:54.267
WILLIAM BRADY IS THE NAME
GOREN USED

25:54.269 --> 25:56.169
WHEN HE WENT UNDERCOVER
AT TATE'S.

25:56.171 --> 25:58.738
WHY IS THERE A POLICY
ON FRANK'S LIFE IN THAT NAME?

25:58.740 --> 26:00.840
SOMEONE WENT TO A LOT OF TROUBLE
TO SET GOREN UP.

26:00.842 --> 26:02.825
I HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS
WITH THIS.

26:02.827 --> 26:04.160
GET HIM
A PSYCH CONSULTATION.

26:04.162 --> 26:08.231
SOMEONE CHECKED MY IUDs.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.701
MY CREDIT UNION ACCOUNT.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.535
MY E-MAILS.

26:12.537 --> 26:13.487
YOU THINK
THAT I'M A SUSPECT?

26:13.489 --> 26:15.472
BOBBY, RIGHT NOW,
YOU ARE A SUSPECT, BUT...

26:15.474 --> 26:17.257
DO YOU THINK I'M CAPABLE
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

26:17.259 --> 26:19.125
<i>YOU CALLED FRANK</i>

26:19.127 --> 26:20.394
THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED,
DETECTIVE.

26:20.396 --> 26:23.730
DID YOU GO OVER TO HIS APARTMENT
WHEN HE DIDN'T ANSWER?

26:23.732 --> 26:26.599
YOU THINK THAT I WOULD KILL
MY OWN BROTHER?

26:26.601 --> 26:29.186
YOU'RE A DETECTIVE.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.320
WHAT SHOULD I THINK?

26:30.322 --> 26:32.939
YOU'RE UNDER
SUSTAINED STRESS.

26:32.941 --> 26:34.006
YOUR MOTHER'S DEATH.

26:34.008 --> 26:36.960
YOUR SUSPENSION.

26:36.962 --> 26:37.911
YOUR FATHER.

26:42.933 --> 26:45.369
MY FATHER!

26:45.371 --> 26:47.937
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TELL YOU THAT?

26:49.824 --> 26:52.893
HMM? YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS
TO ASK ME YOURSELF?

26:52.895 --> 26:54.694
I'M ASKING YOU NOW.

27:03.887 --> 27:05.689
YOU GUYS WANT TO PRY?

27:05.691 --> 27:08.074
KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

27:08.076 --> 27:10.310
THAT IS NOT
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

27:10.312 --> 27:12.345
YEAH, MY FATHER,
HE WAS A KILLER.

27:12.347 --> 27:15.749
YEAH. SO I'M THAT TOO,
IS THAT IT?

27:15.751 --> 27:18.551
YEAH, I'M A KILLER.

27:36.337 --> 27:38.104
ARE YOU HAPPY,
CAPTAIN?

27:38.106 --> 27:39.538
THAT WORK FOR YOU?

27:39.540 --> 27:42.175
THE QUESTION HAD
TO BE ASKED.

27:42.177 --> 27:44.627
AND HERE'S OUR ANSWER.

27:44.629 --> 27:47.897
MARK FORD BRADY IS ROBERT
GOREN'S BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

27:47.899 --> 27:52.319
SO THAT MEANS GOREN
IS SUDDENLY CAPABLE OF MURDER?

27:52.321 --> 27:53.320
[scoffs]

27:53.322 --> 27:55.739
YOU HAVE
A BETTER SUSPECT?

27:57.875 --> 28:01.811
NO, BUT I HAVE
A WITNESS.

28:01.813 --> 28:05.314
MY PARTNER WOULD TELL YOU
WITH SERIAL KILLERS,

28:05.316 --> 28:09.285
THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERVIEW
IS WITH SOMEONE WHO SURVIVES.

28:10.821 --> 28:13.757
SO I JUST FINISHED
MY LECTURE.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.492
I WAS GOING
DOWN THE STAIRCASE.

28:15.494 --> 28:18.661
SOMEONE BUMPED ME,
AND, UM,

28:18.663 --> 28:21.765
I WOKE UP IN
THE HOSPITAL.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.349
BEFORE, YOU SAID
IT WAS A WOMAN.

28:23.351 --> 28:25.285
DID I?
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

28:27.788 --> 28:29.956
WHILE YOU WERE GMNG
YOUR TALK,

28:29.958 --> 28:31.157
DID YOU NOTICE ANYONE

28:31.159 --> 28:32.609
OR ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

28:32.611 --> 28:34.311
I DO NOT LOOK
AT MY AUDIENCE.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.512
I LECTURE FROM NOTES NOW.

28:36.514 --> 28:39.616
I STAY GLUED TO MY CARDS OR
I GO OFF ON TANGENTS, YOU SEE.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.150
DR. GAGE,
BEFORE ALL OF THIS,

28:41.152 --> 28:42.986
WERE YOU IN TOUCH
WITH DETECTIVE GOREN?

28:42.988 --> 28:46.890
DIDN'T I SEE YOU
AT HIS MOTHER'S FUNERAL?

28:46.892 --> 28:49.292
<i>YOU'VE MOVED OFF NICOLE WALLACE</i>

28:49.294 --> 28:51.043
AS A SUSPECT... WHY?

28:51.045 --> 28:55.832
THE POSTMARK
ON NICOLE'S HEART.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.401
THE HEART WAS REMOVED
BEFORE YOU WERE POISONED.

29:05.092 --> 29:06.693
IT'S NOT BOBBY.
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

29:06.695 --> 29:08.345
<i>YOU SURE?</i>

29:08.347 --> 29:09.962
HE CERTAINLY WASN'T THE ONE
WHO BUMPED INTO ME.

29:09.964 --> 29:11.130
THAT I WOULD HAVE NOTICED.

29:11.132 --> 29:14.901
HE IS CAUGHT
IN A TRAP,

29:14.903 --> 29:16.219
SET UP BY SOMEONE CLOSE
TO HIM.

29:16.221 --> 29:17.220
MAYBE EVEN YOU.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.222
EXCUSE ME?

29:19.224 --> 29:20.557
YOU CARE
ABOUT YOUR PARTNER DEEPLY.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.058
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM
THAN ALMOST...

29:22.060 --> 29:23.927
I DON'T NEED
TO LISTEN TO THIS.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.728
YOU CAN HAVE THE ROOM.

29:29.066 --> 29:30.717
[chuckling] OH.

29:30.719 --> 29:31.668
THAT WAS UNCALLED FOR.

29:31.670 --> 29:34.253
<i>YOU HAVE TO LOOK</i>
<i>AT ALL THE OPTIONS, CAPTAIN.</i>

29:34.255 --> 29:36.323
NOW WE'RE BACK TO BOBBY.

29:36.325 --> 29:38.725
NOW WHY WOULD HE SNAP NOW?
HMM?

29:38.727 --> 29:40.126
IN MIDLIFE?

29:40.128 --> 29:43.796
ANY PSYCHOPATHOLOGY WOULD HAVE
MANIFESTED ITSELF EARLIER.

29:43.798 --> 29:44.997
OR...

29:44.999 --> 29:47.633
OR DOCTOR?

29:47.635 --> 29:50.537
OR LAIN DORMANT UNTIL SOME SORT
OF INCITING INCIDENT.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.189
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
SOMETHING MAJOR,

29:52.191 --> 29:55.358
SOMETHING THAT SHAKES
HIS FOUNDATION TO THE CORE.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.243
BUT THIS LOOKS
LIKE REVENGE.

29:57.245 --> 29:58.711
AND EVERYONE
IN BOBBY'S LIFE,

29:58.713 --> 30:02.682
INCLUDING YOU, ME, EAMES
EVEN, [cell phone beeping]

30:02.684 --> 30:04.250
HAS TO BE A SUSPECT.

30:04.252 --> 30:07.353
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME,
ACTUALLY.

30:07.355 --> 30:09.072
GENIUS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT
TO WORK WITH.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.174
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO ME, CAPTAIN?

30:11.176 --> 30:12.441
(Ross)
MORGUE. NOW.

30:12.443 --> 30:14.877
THIS IS MY LIFE!

30:14.879 --> 30:17.180
AND YOU PROMISED
THAT THIS WOULD BE CONFIDENTIAL!

30:17.182 --> 30:18.381
YOU PROMISED ME!

30:18.383 --> 30:20.149
DETECTIVE!

30:22.019 --> 30:23.019
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

30:23.021 --> 30:26.523
FINE.
I DROPPED MY TRAY.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.692
NOTHING BROKEN.
NO DAMAGE.

30:28.694 --> 30:30.126
LET'S GO
FOR A WALK.

30:35.449 --> 30:36.566
I WAS TRYING TO CLEAR YOU.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.567
GOOD, DETECTIVE.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.018
BUT THERE'S
AN INSURANCE POLICY

30:39.020 --> 30:40.253
ON YOUR BROTHER.

30:40.255 --> 30:44.557
PAYABLE TO A SWISS BANK ACCOUNT
IN THE NAME OF WILLIAM BRADY.

30:48.029 --> 30:50.413
THERE'S AN INSURANCE POLICY
ON FRANK?

30:52.783 --> 30:54.217
SOMEONE'S GASLIGHTING YOU.

30:56.420 --> 30:59.089
THAT'S WHAT DECLAN SAID.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.021
<i>(Wen) DETECTIVE GOREN.</i>

31:17.992 --> 31:19.592
YOU'RE HERE
TO SEE JO GAGE?

31:19.594 --> 31:21.861
YUP.

31:21.863 --> 31:24.397
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

31:24.399 --> 31:26.532
WELL, I WAS AFRAID
THAT SHE'D TELL HER FATHER

31:26.534 --> 31:27.967
THAT I WAS GONNA COME
FOR A VISIT.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.620
THAT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.105
SHE'S STILL IN A COMA.

31:32.107 --> 31:36.425
EXTREME BLOOD LOSS DEPRIVED
HER BRAIN OF OXYGEN.

31:36.427 --> 31:39.012
PSYCH HAD JUST CLEARED JO
FOR VISITATION.

31:39.014 --> 31:40.846
ON THE MORNING
OF HER FATHER'S VISIT,

31:40.848 --> 31:42.181
WE FOUND HER
IN HER CELL.

31:42.183 --> 31:43.916
SHE'D BITTEN HER TONGUE OFF.

31:48.322 --> 31:50.272
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMING.

31:50.274 --> 31:53.275
DOES... DOES BOBBY KNOW
I'M HERE?

31:53.277 --> 31:55.244
HE ASKED FOR YOU.

31:58.582 --> 32:00.116
BOBBY.

32:02.185 --> 32:05.088
OH, YOUR PARTNER'S HERE,
HUH?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.156
YEAH, I WAS JUST TELLING HIM
HOW YOU THINK

32:07.158 --> 32:09.191
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR KILLING HIS BROTHER.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.794
[laughs] WELL, THAT'S
ONE WORKING THEORY.

32:11.796 --> 32:14.964
BUT WHY WOULD I DO
THAT NOW?

32:14.966 --> 32:17.433
WOULDN'T I NEED...
WHAT DID YOU TELL THE CAPTAIN?

32:17.435 --> 32:20.136
SOME TERRIBLE TRAUMA?

32:20.138 --> 32:21.537
OH, YOU'VE HAD THOSE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

32:21.539 --> 32:23.305
IN SPADES.
PTSD.

32:23.307 --> 32:25.241
PENT-UP ANGER.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.510
[stammering] IT'S ALL THERE.

32:27.512 --> 32:30.262
IT'S THERE, ALL RIGHT.

32:30.264 --> 32:32.732
BUT NOT TOWARD MY PARTNER.

32:32.734 --> 32:36.402
IF YOU THINK HE CAN HELP YOU,
YOU'RE BOTH OUT OF YOUR MINDS.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.708
DOES SHE REMIND YOU
OF YOUR MOTHER?

32:41.710 --> 32:43.943
COME ON.
KNOCK IT OFF.

32:43.945 --> 32:45.661
<i>OR NICOLE.</i>
<i>[cackling]</i>

32:45.663 --> 32:47.497
NO, I WOULDN'T THINK SO.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.233
I MEAN THOSE TWO WOMEN,
JEEZ, YOU NEVER KNEW

32:50.235 --> 32:51.901
QUITE WHAT TO EXPECT.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.204
BUT THAT'S WHAT MADE 'EM
SO EXCITING, ISN'T IT?

32:54.206 --> 32:56.406
IT'S TOUGH, YOU KNOW,
STAYING ENGAGED

32:56.408 --> 32:58.541
WHEN YOU'RE ALWAYS
TWO STEPS AHEAD

32:58.543 --> 32:59.742
OF EVERYONE ELSE
IN THE ROOM.

32:59.744 --> 33:02.345
IT'S NOT EAMES.
WHY?

33:02.347 --> 33:04.514
SHE LACKS THE NERVE.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.715
NO.

33:05.717 --> 33:08.084
THE IMAGINATION THEN.
WHAT DID REAGAN CALL IT?

33:08.086 --> 33:11.321
UM, WHATCHA...
THE VISION THING.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.138
UM...

33:13.140 --> 33:14.774
THAT WAS BUSH.

33:14.776 --> 33:16.642
WAS IT?

33:16.644 --> 33:18.878
TALK ABOUT
YOUR FATHER ISSUES.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.080
[chuckles]

33:21.082 --> 33:22.715
WERE WE TALKING
ABOUT FATHER ISSUES?

33:22.717 --> 33:24.734
[sucking candy]

33:24.736 --> 33:26.369
ISN'T THAT
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

33:26.371 --> 33:27.754
COME ON, BOBBY.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.823
YOU WAITED A YEAR TO CHECK, UH,
BRADY'S DNA. WHY?

33:30.825 --> 33:33.776
YOU KNEW
ABOUT MY PATERNITY TEST.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.578
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T SAY
SOMETHING TO THE CAPTAIN?

33:35.580 --> 33:37.614
YOU TOLD ME THAT
IN CONFIDENCE.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.582
YOU... AND DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

33:39.584 --> 33:40.650
I GET LOST
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

33:42.253 --> 33:43.453
I WASN'T AFRAID
OF THE TEST.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.637
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:44.639 --> 33:46.005
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS KNEW.

33:46.007 --> 33:49.075
I MEAN, THE MINUTE YOU MET
MR. BRADY, YOU... YOU...

33:49.077 --> 33:50.977
DIDN'T IT ALL MAKE SENSE?

33:50.979 --> 33:53.480
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

33:53.482 --> 33:56.015
YOUR MOTHER'S HUSBAND
NEVER SHOWED YOU LOVE.

33:56.017 --> 33:58.417
AND YOUR MOTHER,

33:58.419 --> 34:01.104
<i>DESPITE EVERYTHING YOU DID</i>
<i>FOR HER, SHE PREFERRED</i>

34:01.106 --> 34:03.005
THAT CANKEROUS BROTHER
OF YOURS TO YOU.

34:03.007 --> 34:04.206
WHY WOULD THAT BE?

34:07.327 --> 34:09.495
SHE KNEW THAT I COULD TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

34:09.496 --> 34:11.414
SHE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.817
WELL, SHE DID,
DIDN'T SHE?

34:14.819 --> 34:17.219
SO YOU DID
WHAT YOU COULD FOR HIM.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.523
YOU PUT HIM BACK IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR MOM AT THE END,

34:20.525 --> 34:21.991
AND WHAT DID HE DO, HMM?

34:25.178 --> 34:26.529
HMM?

34:26.531 --> 34:28.848
HE BETRAYED YOU.

34:28.850 --> 34:31.449
HE TRICKED YOU
INTO PUTTING YOUR CAREER

34:31.452 --> 34:33.603
ON THE LINE
FOR A NEPHEW

34:33.605 --> 34:35.353
YOU NEVER EVEN KNEW EXISTED.

34:35.356 --> 34:36.688
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

34:36.690 --> 34:38.489
[clears throat]

34:38.492 --> 34:41.960
THERE'S A THEME HERE,
BOBBY.

34:41.963 --> 34:46.364
DID YOU EVER ASK YOURSELF
WHY...

34:47.685 --> 34:50.018
WHY NOBODY EVER CAME THROUGH
FOR YOU?

34:50.021 --> 34:52.672
YOU THINK
IT WAS YOUR FAULT?

34:52.674 --> 34:55.274
YES.

34:55.275 --> 34:57.226
I'VE THOUGHT THAT.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.445
IT ISN'T, YOU KNOW.

34:59.447 --> 35:01.431
THEY FAILED YOU.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.100
YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD
FOR 'EM.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.335
AND MORE.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.180
THANKS.

35:17.182 --> 35:19.365
JUST LIKE I DID
FOR JO.

35:23.036 --> 35:25.321
YOU THINK YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD FOR JO?

35:25.323 --> 35:27.256
I DID THE BEST I COULD.
I'M A SINGLE PARENT.

35:27.258 --> 35:30.209
YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER

35:30.211 --> 35:32.411
HAD NEVER BEEN BETTER.

35:32.413 --> 35:34.480
AND SHE'S IN A COMA.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.501
[sighs]

35:38.503 --> 35:39.835
I DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU.

35:39.837 --> 35:44.574
I KNOW YOU TWO ARE CLOSE
IN YOUR WAY.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.560
AND YOU HAD ENOUGH GOING ON.

35:57.937 --> 35:59.639
YOU'RE GOOD.

36:02.793 --> 36:05.561
FOR A MAN
WITH DIMINISHING CAPACITY...

36:08.499 --> 36:09.798
YOU CAN STILL HOLD YOUR OWN.

36:13.737 --> 36:17.657
DIMINISHING CAPACITY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:17.659 --> 36:19.491
JO'S REFUSAL TO SEE YOU,

36:19.493 --> 36:21.411
IS THAT WHAT PUSHED YOUR MIND
OVER THE EDGE?

36:21.413 --> 36:23.462
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'VE LOST IT?

36:23.464 --> 36:25.731
I AM A TENURED PROFESSOR NOW.

36:25.733 --> 36:27.299
I LECTURE.
I WRITE BOOKS.

36:27.301 --> 36:30.436
AND YOU FORGET
TO WASH YOUR HANDS.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.738
YOU EAT CANDY
WITHOUT THE WRAPPER.

36:32.740 --> 36:35.308
WELL, AM I A BAD BOY, HUH?

36:35.310 --> 36:36.426
YOU ATE MONTH-OLD
CHRISTMAS DINNER.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.694
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.629
THE THOUGHT THAT THE FOOD HAD
TURNED NEVER CAME TO YOU?

36:39.631 --> 36:41.598
I GET BUSY WITH MY WORK.
THAT'S ALL.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.632
EXECUTIVE FUNCTION.

36:42.634 --> 36:47.136
OH, YOU WANNA DO
THE WISCONSIN CARD TEST?

36:47.138 --> 36:48.971
THE STROOP?

36:48.973 --> 36:51.574
I DON'T NEED TO. YOUR FRONTAL
LOBE'S BEEN BLOWN OUT, OKAY?

36:51.576 --> 36:53.909
IT'S TOO MUCH FORMALDEHYDE.
DRUG ABUSE.

36:53.911 --> 36:57.262
GENETIC ROULETTE.
THAT CAN BE A FACTOR.

36:57.264 --> 37:00.750
MAN WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE,

37:00.752 --> 37:02.902
MUST HAVE BEEN EXCRUCIATING

37:02.904 --> 37:05.421
TO KNOW WHAT YOUR FUTURE WAS,
YOU KNOW?

37:05.423 --> 37:07.690
YOUR LOSS OF JUDGMENT.

37:07.692 --> 37:10.393
YOUR LACK OF INHIBITION.

37:13.580 --> 37:16.883
THERE'S NO MEDS FOR THAT.

37:16.885 --> 37:19.134
THERE'S OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY.

37:19.136 --> 37:22.421
I'LL MAKE UM...
UH... [sighs]

37:22.423 --> 37:24.656
UH...

37:24.658 --> 37:25.958
COLLAGES.

37:25.960 --> 37:26.959
[chuckles]

37:26.961 --> 37:29.061
YEAH.

37:29.063 --> 37:31.914
YOU DID THAT ALREADY.

37:34.851 --> 37:36.819
YOU F...

37:36.821 --> 37:39.322
CUT AND PASTED THE...

37:39.324 --> 37:40.790
PIECES OF MY LIFE TOGETHER.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.958
VERY GOOD, BOBBY.
YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.027
YOU DID THIS, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU KILLED MY BROTHER.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.330
NO, NO.
THAT WAS NICOLE.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.225
HOW DID YOU FIND HER?

37:59.227 --> 38:02.095
[laughs]

38:02.097 --> 38:03.830
MY LATEST BOOK.

38:03.832 --> 38:06.132
I WROTE
ABOUT WOMEN SERIAL KILLERS

38:06.134 --> 38:07.533
LIKE JO, LIKE HER.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.502
I KNEW SHE'D FIND IT
THEN FIND ME.

38:10.504 --> 38:14.023
[laughs]

38:14.025 --> 38:16.275
SHE TRIED
TO SEDUCE ME, BOBBY.

38:16.277 --> 38:18.444
I THINK YOU AND I
MAY BE THE ONLY TWO MEN

38:18.446 --> 38:19.946
WHO EVER SAID NO
TO HER.

38:19.948 --> 38:21.814
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO ENGAGE HER.

38:21.816 --> 38:23.048
YEAH?

38:26.703 --> 38:27.770
AND THEN ONCE...

38:29.673 --> 38:33.609
ONCE YOU ENGAGED HER?

38:33.611 --> 38:37.380
I CONVINCED HER
THAT I WAS FURIOUS WITH YOU

38:37.382 --> 38:39.365
ABOUT JO.

38:40.734 --> 38:44.469
SHE SAID
SHE MISSED HAVING A PARTNER.

38:49.409 --> 38:51.376
AND MY BROTHER?

38:51.378 --> 38:53.095
THAT WAS HER IDEA?

38:53.097 --> 38:54.897
I LET HER THINK SO.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.131
I KNEW
SHE COULD GET AT HIM.

38:56.133 --> 38:58.367
SHE SAID
IT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH.

38:58.369 --> 38:59.835
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE SMILE,
A LITTLE SHOVE.

39:06.443 --> 39:08.243
DECLAN,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

39:08.245 --> 39:10.112
HE WAS GOING DOWN ANYWAY.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.015
BOBBY, I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TAKING YOU WITH HIM.

39:15.184 --> 39:17.903
YOU DID THIS FOR ME?

39:17.905 --> 39:19.839
NO.

39:23.376 --> 39:24.509
FOR BOTH OF US.

39:24.511 --> 39:28.597
AFTER JO,
I HAD NO ONE.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.649
AND YOU...

39:33.770 --> 39:35.404
YOU'RE THE SON
I NEVER HAD.

39:35.406 --> 39:38.891
WHEN I SAW YOU
AT YOUR MOTHER'S FUNERAL,

39:38.893 --> 39:41.811
YOU BROKE MY HEART.

39:41.813 --> 39:46.531
I WANTED YOU TO ENGAGE
AGAIN.

39:46.533 --> 39:49.652
SO I GAVE YOU A PUZZLE.

39:49.654 --> 39:51.370
TO SOLVE.

39:51.372 --> 39:52.738
TO PLAY.

39:55.075 --> 39:57.093
A PUZZLE?

39:57.095 --> 40:00.163
YOU THINK THAT I NEEDED HER
TO GET ME BACK IN THE GAME?

40:00.165 --> 40:01.297
PRECISELY.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.398
[sobs]

40:02.400 --> 40:03.766
AND AFTER
SHE'D ACCOMPLISHED THAT,

40:03.768 --> 40:05.467
NATURALLY SHE TURNED ON ME,

40:05.469 --> 40:06.468
BUT I WAS WAITING.

40:06.470 --> 40:08.971
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER,
BOBBY.

40:08.973 --> 40:11.040
WHEN SHE REALIZED
IT WAS FINALLY HER TIME,

40:11.042 --> 40:14.877
HE LOOKED UP AT ME
WITH THOSE BIG DOE-EYES OF HERS,

40:14.879 --> 40:16.712
AND SHE SAID,

40:16.714 --> 40:20.933
"YOU TELL BOBBY
HE'S THE ONLY MAN I EVER LOVED."

40:23.803 --> 40:27.072
AS IF A MONSTER LIKE THAT
WERE CAPABLE OF LOVE.

40:27.074 --> 40:28.090
YOU KNOW, I...

40:28.092 --> 40:29.659
WHAT ELSE?

40:29.661 --> 40:31.493
I'M CURIOUS NOW.

40:31.495 --> 40:35.731
WHO... WHO ARE YOU
GONNA MISS MORE?

40:35.733 --> 40:38.434
NICOLE
OR YOUR BROTHER?

40:41.421 --> 40:43.806
TELL ME WHO ELSE.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.807
WHO ELSE
DID YOU KILL?

40:45.809 --> 40:46.725
DONNY?

40:46.727 --> 40:48.727
YOUR NEPHEW?
NO.

40:48.729 --> 40:51.931
NO, I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
EVEN IF I FOUND HIM.

40:51.933 --> 40:57.687
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE HELPED YOU.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.805
HELPED ME.

40:59.807 --> 41:01.407
HELPED ME.

41:07.697 --> 41:09.331
YOU STILL DON'T SEE,
DO YOU?

41:13.002 --> 41:15.321
[sighing through his teeth]

41:16.890 --> 41:18.658
YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN YOU KNOW.

41:18.660 --> 41:21.177
YOU...

41:21.179 --> 41:25.398
FRANK, NICOLE, ME...

41:25.400 --> 41:27.633
WE'RE DEAD WEIGHT.

41:27.635 --> 41:31.353
I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE A CLEAN SLATE.

41:38.645 --> 41:42.047
YOU'RE FREE NOW.

41:47.587 --> 41:50.923
BOBBY...

41:50.925 --> 41:52.791
YOU'RE FREE.
