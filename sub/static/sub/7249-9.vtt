00:02.544 --> 00:03.754
I'm back.

00:03.795 --> 00:04.838
Kitchen.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.341
I couldn't make up my mind...

00:07.424 --> 00:10.469
so I got The Shining and Bringing Up Baby.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.804
Now, I know you're thinking:

00:12.888 --> 00:17.017
'One's a movie about a homicidal parent,
and the other one's... '

00:17.476 --> 00:18.852
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.312
- Hi, Mom.
- What'd you break?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.189
Nothing. The broiler.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.525
But this came for you and Max.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.611
We're thinking it's a wedding present.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.869
'Lorelai Gilmore and Max Medina. '
Guess news doesn't always travel fast.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.120
- Are you gonna open it?
- No.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.580
Aren't you curious?

00:38.664 --> 00:41.959
No, just leave it there.
I'll take it back tomorrow.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.002
But there's not a return address.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.295
- Isn't there a card?
- No.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.631
- Maybe there's one inside.
- With a return address.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.299
You'd have to open it to find out.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.724
Fine. Give me a knife.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.137
This is so exciting. Maybe not.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.854
An ice-cream maker!

01:01.895 --> 01:03.904
A Musso Lussino 480.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.781
Somebody sent a fascist ice-cream maker?

01:05.816 --> 01:09.152
Italian design, stainless steel body,
chrome finish.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.279
And no card. Perfect.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.782
Jackson just got in his apple crop.
We can make cider ice cream.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.619
We can, using his ice cream maker.
But II Duce here is going back.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.996
To where? Maybe it's an orphan.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.338
That's right. We'd be giving it a home.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.334
Once again, I bring up the fact
that this is a wedding present.

01:24.369 --> 01:26.628
As I am not getting married,
neither God's law...

01:26.670 --> 01:28.964
nor Emily Post allows me to keep this.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.175
But isn't there a rule about late presents?

01:31.216 --> 01:35.179
Like, if it arrives after a certain date,
the giver forfeits all rights of return.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.555
- Exactly.
- Nice try.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.515
It's true. I saw it on Martha Stewart.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.186
She was doing a double program.
The first half was on massaging your dog.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.521
And she had this chow,
and she was rubbing it...

01:44.938 --> 01:49.943
But the second half was about gifts,
and she said if it arrives after 10 weeks...

01:50.027 --> 01:53.071
- Eight.
- Eight weeks, you don't have to return it.

01:53.197 --> 01:56.206
Clearly this is shaping up
to be one of those moments...

01:56.241 --> 01:59.203
that St. Peter will show
on the big video screen when I die...

01:59.244 --> 02:01.914
and I, for one,
don't want to see us staggering around...

02:01.955 --> 02:04.166
with ice cream
slathered all over our faces...

02:04.208 --> 02:05.626
while my soul hangs in the balance.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.419
So until I can find out who sent this,
no one goes near it.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.923
And we're watching The Shining.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.384
I bet Max would let us keep it.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074

03:11.108 --> 03:14.570
Believe it or not, Shakespeare
probably never intended his plays...

03:14.611 --> 03:16.572
to be read by students sitting at desks...

03:16.655 --> 03:20.576
more concerned with getting 'A's'
than with the fate of Macbeth.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.996
His plays were meant
to be experienced, lived.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.082
So, with that in mind...

03:27.291 --> 03:29.793
together with
my third-period Shakespeare...

03:29.960 --> 03:31.885
you will be split into five groups.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.258
And each group will assume responsibility
for one act of Romeo and Juliet...

03:36.300 --> 03:38.719
which will be performed
a week from Sunday.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.637
You will nominate the director...

03:40.721 --> 03:44.057
you will cast the scene,
rehearse the scene...

03:44.266 --> 03:47.394
and interpret the scene
in your own individual manner.

03:47.477 --> 03:52.191
Last year we did Richard III.
One group did their scene as the Mafiosi.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.152
Another set theirs
during the Roman empire.

03:55.194 --> 03:58.322
And my favorite, the climactic last scene...

03:58.405 --> 04:01.617
was set during the final days
of The Sonny and Cher Show.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.037
Just remember,
whatever interpretation you choose...

04:05.162 --> 04:08.373
should highlight the themes
you see in the scene.

04:09.041 --> 04:13.378
And if the love of the Bard's language
still doesn't inspire you...

04:13.413 --> 04:16.507
remember, this will be 50%
of your final grade.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.257
- Act Five.
- Act Five.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.843
- Act Five?
- Act Five.

04:19.927 --> 04:24.348
Why don't they sew our sides together
and rename us Chang and Eng?

04:27.476 --> 04:29.186
- Rory.
- Henry, hi.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.939
Act Three, sword fight. You?

04:31.974 --> 04:33.357
Act Five, death scene.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.944
- Nice. So, tonight at 8:00?
- I'll tell Lane.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.154
- Rory, sorry to interrupt.
- Hi, Henry.

04:39.196 --> 04:43.033
But see, we're all there trying to map out
a game plan and rehearsal schedule...

04:43.158 --> 04:45.577
and I'm sure whatever you two
are talking about here...

04:45.661 --> 04:49.164
is so much more fascinating
and important and, let's just say it, fun...

04:49.289 --> 04:52.626
but I'd really like to get an 'A'
on this assignment, and to do that...

04:52.668 --> 04:56.004
you'll have to discuss your sock hops
and clambakes some other time.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.673
Okay? Thanks.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.425
That was scary.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.470
It'll be a lot scarier
once she gets a megaphone in her hands.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.264
I say we meet in the cafeteria.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.225
The acoustics are very similar
to Grant Hall, and...

05:08.308 --> 05:09.268
Look who showed up.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.186
- Sorry.
- Save it.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.647
Look who's back from suspension.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.774
Tristin got suspended again?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.359
You hadn't noticed he'd been gone?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.736
- What did he do?
- Took apart Mr. McCaffey's car...

05:19.862 --> 05:22.406
and put it back together
in the science building hallway.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.157
- You're kidding.
- Not by himself.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.659
Duncan and Bowman were there, too.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.995
Plus the mechanics
they paid to do the actual work.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.540
Anyone dumb enough to hang out with
Butch Cassidy and the Sun-dunce Kid...

05:31.665 --> 05:34.251
- deserves whatever they get.
- How'd he fall in with them?

05:34.286 --> 05:37.087
The year started, and there they were.
Side by side.

05:37.122 --> 05:39.006
And practically dressing the same.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.091
It's very On the Town.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.390
Watch it.

05:49.308 --> 05:52.853
Aunt Bobbie, hi.
It's Lorelai, Richard and Emily's girl.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.605
I'm the one with...

05:55.230 --> 05:59.193
That's right. Wow, you don't
hear the word 'wedlock' much anymore.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.527
I'm home.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.531
Really? The Bible said all that, huh?

06:04.615 --> 06:08.327
Did it mention me by name?
I mean, okay, I'm just kidding.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.872
Judging by
your Billy Graham impression...

06:11.955 --> 06:14.458
I am guessing you didn't send me
an ice cream maker...

06:14.500 --> 06:17.669
so maybe you could just give me
Aunt Clarissa's phone number?

06:18.712 --> 06:22.007
No, I hadn't heard. That's terrible.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.802
Then I guess she had it coming,
didn't she?

06:25.928 --> 06:29.181
Listen, I'd love to chat about
who else in the family is currently...

06:29.264 --> 06:32.226
or soon to be headed for Hell,
but I've got to run.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.853
I promise to call
in the next 20 years, okay?

06:35.646 --> 06:36.688
Bye-bye.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.943
Scary. My parents are turning out
to be the normal ones in the family.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.946
- No luck?
- I still have the Pennsylvania Gilmores.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.197
How was your day?

06:45.239 --> 06:47.449
I have to perform
Act Five of Romeo and Juliet...

06:47.533 --> 06:49.743
- with Paris, Madeline, and Louise.
- Really?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.286
Paris appointed herself as director.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.580
- Nice. What part are you playing?
- Don't know yet.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.834
She's still mulling over the screen tests.
We'll find out tomorrow.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.877
- Screen tests?
- Twenty-four takes.

06:58.912 --> 07:00.838
- I so want a copy.
- Forget it.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.965
Sell it on the Internet. Make a fortune.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.551
'First we brought you
Pamela and Tommy Lee.

07:05.592 --> 07:09.179
'Now prepare yourselves
for the crazy antics of Rory and the Bard!'

07:09.263 --> 07:11.522
I told Paris
you'd make all of our costumes.

07:11.557 --> 07:14.518
She wants to have a concept meeting
with you tomorrow at 3:00.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.602
What?

07:15.727 --> 07:20.107
She needs a rÃ©sumÃ© and samples
of your previous work and referrals.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.650
And my bare butt to kiss.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.381
If that'll set you apart
from the other applicants, yes.

07:24.416 --> 07:27.030
I didn't know there was someone
in our family named Bunny.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.657
Cross her off the list.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.492
Poor Bunny.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.873
Hello?

07:35.914 --> 07:36.957
Henry, hi.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.041
Am I late?

07:38.167 --> 07:39.710
No, right on time. Hold on.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.468
I'm heading for class.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.047
There's pizza/Luke's money
on the table for dinner.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.299
Thank you.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.721
Kim's Antiques.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.599
Hello, Mrs. Kim. This is Rory.
May I please speak with Lane?

07:53.724 --> 07:55.893
- Lane is studying.
- Wait, mama!

07:57.060 --> 07:59.188
- Mama, is that for me?
- Why?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.523
I was just expecting a call from Rory,
and I...

08:01.648 --> 08:03.108
You do your Math? History?

08:03.192 --> 08:04.234
- Biology?
- No.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.987
- Why?
- I'm not taking Biology. I took it last year.

08:07.022 --> 08:09.656
That's it? One year and you know
all there is to know?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.491
Tomorrow we look into private school.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.535
Mama, please, the phone?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.746
Five minutes. I'm counting.

08:15.954 --> 08:16.997
Hello?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.540
Lane. Hold on.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.460
- Henry?
- Here.

08:21.495 --> 08:22.676
- Lane?
- Here.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.379
Okay, guys, talk to you later.

08:24.414 --> 08:27.055
So, Rory, how are you?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.967
I'm good. How're you doing?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.761
Okay, I'm gone.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.096
Do me a favor
and make some of those calls for me.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.933
- Aren't you going a little far with this?
- What do you mean?

08:35.974 --> 08:38.184
I know you want to return
the ice cream maker...

08:38.227 --> 08:41.730
but you did make an honest effort
to contact the person that sent this...

08:41.772 --> 08:44.274
It's called closure, hon. I need it, okay?

08:44.650 --> 08:46.401
Okay. Uncle Randolph.

08:47.819 --> 08:48.904
Sorry, guys.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.699
- They'll be off in a sec.
- Okay. Don't wait too long.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.118
I think Randolph
was Bunny's older brother.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.245
Got it.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.750
Once again, ladies and gentlemen,
she takes the last burrito.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.254
- And hello to you, too.
- Week after week. How do you do it?

09:05.295 --> 09:08.507
I told you, correct change.
Go in for that dollar-bill nonsense...

09:08.590 --> 09:11.468
you'll be standing there for 10 minutes
watching it.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.889
I thought you had a special relationship
with this vending machine.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.183
Only in the sense that it keeps me alive.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.352
I actually have a theory on that.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.897
Ever since we were children,
we got our nourishment from our mothers.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.192
Okay. Are you trying to gross me out
so I can't eat my burrito?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.820
- Now we're getting it from machines.
- Your point being?

09:29.945 --> 09:32.447
It's a conspiracy
getting us ready for the day...

09:32.489 --> 09:35.784
when we'll all be raised by machines.
No human contact whatsoever.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.578
You know my mother, don't you?

09:37.661 --> 09:40.330
The Twilight Zone marathon was on
all week.

09:40.372 --> 09:44.042
So all this is a way of saying you want
to look at my notes on the reading.

09:44.077 --> 09:47.171
- Such perception.
- And in one so young and beautiful.

09:47.206 --> 09:48.262
Frightening, isn't it?

09:48.297 --> 09:50.174
I feel bad doing this every week.

09:50.299 --> 09:53.218
Really? I'd have thought
you'd have gotten used to it by now.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.180
Come on, Lorelai.
I've got to pay you back somehow.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.057
How about you let me take you out
to dinner one night?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.100
Dinner?

10:00.142 --> 10:03.020
Maybe even somewhere
that doesn't require correct change.

10:03.145 --> 10:06.899
Unless you're firmly into the coin thing.
Then I know a good Automat.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.110
- I don't know.
- I was kidding about the Automat.

10:10.235 --> 10:13.030
No, an Automat is fine.

10:14.072 --> 10:18.076
It's just, my schedule's kind of crazy
for the next couple weeks.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.953
Okay. It was just a thought.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.332
But if you suddenly get an opening,
give me a call.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.001
Great. Sure. Thanks.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.631
- Enjoy the notes.
- Thank you. Enjoy the burrito.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.219
We're the Monkees

10:36.254 --> 10:37.561
Where's Paris?

10:37.596 --> 10:40.432
She'll be here in a minute.
She said had to get some things.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.685
- Hi. I'm Rory.
- Brad. From third-period Shakespeare.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.855
He's the answer to our
'lack of boys' problem. Isn't that swell?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.525
- Maybe we should start.
- Without Paris?

10:49.566 --> 10:50.984
That could be lethal.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.986
We could decide on what motif
we want to do.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.780
We're doing traditional Elizabethan.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.616
- I thought the point was to...
- The point is to get an 'A'...

10:57.741 --> 11:00.077
not to make Romeo and Juliet
into a Vegas lounge act.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.039
Besides, we have the death scene.
It's classic. It's famous. Who are you?

11:04.081 --> 11:05.457
I'm Brad...

11:06.166 --> 11:09.253
from third-period Shakespeare, ma'am.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.797
I want everyone to read the chapters
on acting...

11:11.922 --> 11:14.424
I photocopied
out of Houseman's memoirs tonight.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.301
Everyone will be off-book by Friday...

11:16.385 --> 11:20.430
and if you plan on missing rehearsal,
you'd better bring a coroner's note.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.891
Tell me you didn't just have that
lying around.

11:22.926 --> 11:25.202
We're short on boys.
That makes you Romeo.

11:25.237 --> 11:27.479
- Louise, you can play the friar.
- Excuse me?

11:27.563 --> 11:30.274
- The gang's all here.
- This is a meeting.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.943
- Sorry I'm late.
- What do you think you're doing?

11:32.985 --> 11:36.029
Prof. Anderson forgot to include me
when she made up the groups.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.322
So she told me to pick one.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.450
Fine. You have four other acts
to choose from. Take your pick.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.453
Summer's in Act One,
Beth and Jessica are in Act Two...

11:43.495 --> 11:45.122
Kate's in Act Three...

11:45.164 --> 11:49.585
Claire, Cathy and Mary are in Act Four.
This is the only one free of ex-girlfriends.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.087
So we're being punished
for our good taste?

11:52.122 --> 11:53.547
Paris, you hurt me.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.716
Do you no longer
have any need for me at all?

11:55.757 --> 11:58.725
Yes, we have great need.
You can be our Romeo.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.555
- Brad is Romeo.
- Put in your other contact, grandma.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.850
Tristin is Romeo.
Brad can be the second guard on the left.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.977
- No.
- She's kind of right, Paris.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.645
Tristin was born to be Romeo.

12:08.687 --> 12:12.983
I'm the director and I'll decide who's born
to be what. And Brad is Romeo.

12:13.192 --> 12:16.320
- Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
- What'd you say?

12:16.403 --> 12:20.115
Someone's letting her personal feelings
interfere with her leadership.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.327
My only feeling is I don't want to give
the most important part...

12:23.362 --> 12:25.621
to someone who can't even manage
to stay in school.

12:25.662 --> 12:29.249
I'm just going to say one thing.
50% of our final grade.

12:29.458 --> 12:33.212
Is there going to be any scratching,
or is it just a verbal thing?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.380
What do you think about this?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.803
How are you at speaking
in front of a lot of people?

12:41.838 --> 12:43.180
I tend to throw up.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.351
Fine. But I swear, you flake on this,
and you'll pray you get suspended.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.646
- I've got to run. Are we done here?
- Rehearsal tomorrow night.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.524
Good. So now Brad can be Friar Tuck,
and I can be Juliet.

12:53.559 --> 12:56.485
Wrong. Juliet's supposed to be chaste.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.821
- Then...
- And she has more than three lines.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.866
No.

13:02.908 --> 13:05.577
- Too late.
- Can't be. We haven't done anything yet.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.080
You're Juliet.
You're the best public speaker here...

13:08.121 --> 13:10.707
you have the waif thing down,
and you'll look great dead.

13:10.749 --> 13:11.959
Next order of business.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.170
I did some location scouting this morning,
and I think the courtyard...

13:16.129 --> 13:19.842
Okay, here we go.
Low-fat whole-wheat blueberry pancakes.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.844
- Are there 12?
- 12 what?

13:21.927 --> 13:25.055
Blueberries. I can only have 12 blueberries
for breakfast.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.890
- Or what?
- What do you mean, 'Or what?'

13:26.974 --> 13:30.853
- What happens if you eat 13 blueberries?
- This is a silly conversation.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.230
- Would you die?
- Just hand me the plate.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.275
- Only if you don't count.
- I won't count.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.903
Swear. Raise your right hand and say,
'May Destiny's Child break up...

13:39.987 --> 13:42.322
'if I count these blueberries. '

13:42.948 --> 13:44.992
- Pick another group.
- Nope.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.078
I hate you!

13:52.249 --> 13:54.418
Got to start getting in earlier.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.713
- Hey, I remember you.
- I am donating it to the Inn.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.257
- Honey, that's very thoughtful.
- Yes, it is.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.760
But we have an ice cream maker,
a professional one.

14:04.011 --> 14:08.140
It means we can make enough ice cream
for everyone in the Inn...

14:08.432 --> 14:10.517
- whereas this little guy...
- Fernando.

14:10.601 --> 14:14.730
Fernando, try as he might,
can only make enough ice cream for you.

14:15.189 --> 14:18.066
- So we don't need him here?
- No, we don't.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.737
Can't you find some use for him?
I mean, he's new and shiny.

14:21.778 --> 14:25.282
It's not his fault he's part of the other life
I almost had...

14:25.449 --> 14:28.160
but don't have now,
and kind of don't want to be reminded of.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.079
- I guess I can put my change in him.
- Thank you.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.415
- Honey, can I say something?
- Shoot.

14:33.457 --> 14:36.126
- I'm a little concerned about you.
- Why?

14:36.168 --> 14:39.213
You just seem very emotional
about this ice cream maker.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.548
- I am not.
- You named the ice cream maker.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.635
- I name everything.
- You didn't name the toaster.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.345
Poppy.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.597
- You just made that up.
- I did not.

14:48.764 --> 14:52.309
All right, but admit it.
Poppy is a damn good name for a toaster.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.811
It's been quite a while
since you and Max broke up.

14:54.846 --> 14:56.897
- I'm fine, Sookie.
- Okay, you're fine.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.024
- But are you moving on?
- Yes, I'm moving on.

14:59.059 --> 15:01.109
How many dates have you had post-Max?

15:01.235 --> 15:03.904
- What's that got to do with anything?
- You're hibernating.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.822
- I'm not hibernating.
- Yes, you are.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.325
Look at this skirt. I'm not hibernating.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.993
Then how many dates have you been on?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.412
I was engaged.
You don't just get over that.

15:12.447 --> 15:14.706
But you went through
your mourning period.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.502
- And you said it was over.
- It was. Is.

15:19.086 --> 15:23.549
Are you at least putting the vibe out there,
so they'll know you're available?

15:23.674 --> 15:27.511
If it'll make you feel any better,
I just got asked out the other night.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.680
What? You're kidding. Who is he?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.224
- Some guy from my business class.
- Business class.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.686
He's a pretty cool guy, actually.
He's cute, funny...

15:36.395 --> 15:38.647
He's a little younger, but he's very sharp.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.733
We have this little bit going
about me stealing his burrito.

15:41.768 --> 15:44.493
'Stealing his burrito. ' You kids.

15:44.528 --> 15:48.156
- No, like a real burrito.
- You've stolen his burrito.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.869
- Okay, forget the burrito.
- Fine. When are you guys going out?

15:51.910 --> 15:55.622
- I didn't exactly say yes.
- Why not? You've already got the skirt.

15:55.664 --> 15:59.376
I don't know. What if it doesn't work out?
And the class will be weird...

15:59.459 --> 16:01.753
and it'll definitely screw up our burrito bit.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.638
Honey, come on,
every guy doesn't have to be 'the guy. '

16:04.673 --> 16:08.844
- Isn't it too soon for the transition guy?
- Don't think of him as the transition guy.

16:08.879 --> 16:11.054
Think of him as the pre-transition guy.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.891
- Pre-transition guy? You're allowed that?
- Absolutely.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.226
I've got to read
the rule book more carefully.

16:16.261 --> 16:20.230
- So?
- So I will call him later tonight.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.232
Great! That's so great!

16:25.110 --> 16:27.613
- It's all or nothing, Sparky.
- Damn you!

16:28.363 --> 16:31.325
She's letting you go? That's amazing.
What changed her mind?

16:31.366 --> 16:34.161
I let her watch Romeo and Juliet
with Leo and Claire Danes.

16:34.244 --> 16:35.996
- I'd have thought she hated it.
- She did.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.082
But trust my mom to turn one
of the world's great love stories...

16:39.124 --> 16:42.794
into a cautionary tale of what happens
when children disobey their parents.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.089
So you're not any closer
to telling your parents about Henry?

16:46.131 --> 16:49.426
What are the options if I tell them?
They hate him, and it's over.

16:49.468 --> 16:52.304
They love him, so he becomes odious
to me, and it's over.

16:52.339 --> 16:53.972
Things are fine the way they are.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.808
Calling him Rory on the phone,
in case your mom's listening?

16:56.934 --> 17:00.270
I've grown fond of my cage, Rory. Bye.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.733
- What dost my lady think?
- That you're going to be late for the joust?

17:05.858 --> 17:10.113
I meant of thy lovely headdress
crafted by thy mother's artful hand.

17:10.147 --> 17:11.538
It pleaseth me mucheth...

17:11.573 --> 17:14.742
but hath my beauteous mother
looked at the time?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.453
Crap.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.133
Two other groups are rehearsing
in the Grant Hall...

17:23.167 --> 17:26.922
even though I reserved it way in advance
and confirmed the reservation twice.

17:26.957 --> 17:29.800
They're going to be there,
I don't want them spying on us.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.344
The ending to Romeo and Juliet
isn't exactly a secret.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.436
- Hello, our interpretation?
- Right.

17:34.471 --> 17:37.933
I found a web site called miss-patty. Net.
It's in your town.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.727
- There's a miss-patty. Net?
- Have you heard of it?

17:40.769 --> 17:43.647
Is it big enough?
The site says it's 720 square feet.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.489
I'd rather just rehearse somewhere else.

17:45.524 --> 17:49.361
I got enough to be worried about without
you being embarrassed of where you live.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.487
I'm not embarrassed.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.906
I want to keep my school life
and home life separate.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.908
Tough. Madeline and Louise
are on their way.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.702
See you in half an hour.

18:00.330 --> 18:04.209
Have you seen my bag with the beads
and the fur that looks like Stalin's head?

18:04.244 --> 18:05.843
- We're rehearsing here now.
- What?

18:05.878 --> 18:09.590
Paris didn't want anyone spying on us,
so now we're rehearsing in Stars Hollow.

18:09.673 --> 18:10.757
This sucks.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.177
So you don't have to drive to Hartford.
Why the face?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.888
- Tristin is in our group.
- Yeah, you told me.

18:16.013 --> 18:19.474
So Tristin, he's in our group,
so that means he's...

18:20.601 --> 18:22.477
And Dean lives here, so this sucks.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.855
Know what? I'm going to need
a few more vowels here.

18:24.890 --> 18:26.231
- I have to tell him.
- Tell who?

18:26.315 --> 18:27.566
- Dean.
- Tell Dean what?

18:27.691 --> 18:31.195
That Tristin and I,
that we kissed at that stupid party.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.363
I have no choice.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.200
Because if Tristin sees Dean,
he'll tell him...

18:36.283 --> 18:39.369
and then it'll be worse,
because it'll be like I kept it from him.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.371
- Okay, just calm down.
- Which I was.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.750
I was keeping it from him.
I can't believe it. Now I have to tell him.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.585
- You're right.
- I am?

18:46.627 --> 18:49.338
- I think you should tell him.
- Of course. I have to.

18:49.379 --> 18:53.133
Then, at the play, right as Tristin enters
to find you dead...

18:53.217 --> 18:55.552
and pulls out the vial of poison
to kill himself...

18:55.636 --> 18:58.263
Dean can leap from the audience
and rip his head off...

18:58.388 --> 19:01.391
adding a level of reality
few productions have seen before.

19:01.426 --> 19:03.852
You'll get an 'A,'
the Actors Studio will go nuts...

19:03.894 --> 19:07.189
you'll have James Lipton asking you
what your favorite swear word is.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.316
- It's a great plan.
- You, not helping.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.527
To prevent a homicide? Yes, I am.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.239
- I have to tell him. I don't have a choice.
- Okay. Fine.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.200
- Try it out on me first.
- What?

19:18.242 --> 19:19.701
Pretend I'm Dean.

19:19.785 --> 19:23.163
If you're going to tell him this,
you better have down what you'll say.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.082
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.883
- Sorry. Serious now.
- Okay, Dean.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.435
Remember last year,
when we had broken up...

19:38.470 --> 19:41.014
and we weren't together anymore
because we'd broken up?

19:41.098 --> 19:42.850
Good, mention it three times. Keep going.

19:42.933 --> 19:46.812
There was this party,
and I went, and Tristin was there.

19:47.104 --> 19:51.275
And somehow, I'm not really sure how,
we ended up in a room together...

19:51.608 --> 19:54.611
- and we kissed.
- You and Tristin?

19:55.946 --> 19:57.447
- On the hand?
- No.

19:57.482 --> 19:58.532
- Cheek?
- No.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.492
- He kissed you, or you kissed him?
- Both.

20:00.527 --> 20:02.161
- So you kissed him?
- Yes.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.663
- When?
- I already told you three times.

20:04.746 --> 20:08.000
- When we were broken up.
- Not a good idea to yell at him right now.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.169
- When during the breakup?
- What do you mean?

20:10.294 --> 20:12.880
I mean, how long after we broke up
did you kiss Tristin?

20:13.005 --> 20:17.176
- Just the night after we broke up.
- The night after I told you I loved you?

20:17.885 --> 20:21.680
The next night, after I told you I loved you,
you kissed Tristin?

20:21.722 --> 20:23.432
- I'm a terrible person.
- Hold on.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.684
He's absolutely right.
He told me he loved me...

20:25.767 --> 20:28.854
- and the next night, I go and kiss Tristin.
- That was me, not Dean.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.321
- I hate myself.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.568
You were hurt and confused
and broken up. You did nothing wrong.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.696
- Tell that to Dean.
- We're not telling Dean anything.

20:37.821 --> 20:41.533
I know you are Miss Honesty.
I have seen the banner in the closet.

20:41.617 --> 20:44.661
But this kind of honesty
will only make you feel less guilty...

20:44.745 --> 20:46.795
and it's going to hurt Dean very much.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.667
It's possibly going to screw up
the really good thing you have going now.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.711
- Do you want that?
- No, I don't.

20:52.753 --> 20:57.299
All right, then. Relax. Be calm.
Everything will be fine.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.219
I've got to go.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.430
Can I ask you one more question?

21:04.348 --> 21:06.850
- Do you think my hair looks cool?
- Bye.

21:07.059 --> 21:09.651
'Cause some days I wake up
and I'm, like, 'Cool. '

21:09.686 --> 21:13.481
- Some days, I'm, like, 'Could be cooler. '
- I won't wait up for you.

21:13.516 --> 21:17.277
Today I got up and I was, like,
'Left side cool, right side not so cool. '

21:17.611 --> 21:18.612
Bye.

21:21.323 --> 21:25.869
Just listen to your breathing
and let the world melt away.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.955
And in.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.166
And out.

21:35.921 --> 21:40.551
Excuse me. We reserved this place
for 8:00 sharp, and my watch says 8:04.

21:40.843 --> 21:45.097
Tell it to go outside and have a smoke.
You can't rush a cool-down, sweetheart.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.225
I understand the whole
Mystic Pizza, small-town...

21:48.350 --> 21:50.227
we-don't-let-a-clock-run-our-lives thing.

21:50.269 --> 21:52.354
But I come from the big city,
where money talks.

21:52.521 --> 21:55.691
I'm paying good money for this place,
and I have a schedule to keep.

21:55.816 --> 21:59.236
Be careful, darling, or your face
is going to freeze like that.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.738
What's with the cast from Cocoon?

22:01.822 --> 22:03.991
Where's Tristin?
He said he was coming with you.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.034
He's here.
He just went over to the market.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.536
- What?
- He needed cigarettes...

22:07.619 --> 22:09.913
in case we didn't know that he was bad.

22:09.948 --> 22:11.165
I'll be right back.

22:11.248 --> 22:13.750
- Where are you going?
- I'll just be a sec.

22:14.793 --> 22:17.212
Okay, now they're just sleeping.

22:17.296 --> 22:21.466
Excuse me, stock boy, could you tell me
where I could find the shortening?

22:22.801 --> 22:26.013
Now that is a fine-looking apron.
I mean, really sensational.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.681
What are you doing here?

22:27.764 --> 22:31.018
To be honest,
there's something I wanted to ask you.

22:32.352 --> 22:35.731
In your professional opinion,
which one would make my cakes fluffier?

22:35.772 --> 22:38.066
You drove all the way here
just to be a jerk?

22:38.192 --> 22:40.944
There aren't enough people
who can't stand you in Hartford?

22:40.986 --> 22:42.738
- I'm here for Rory.
- What?

22:42.779 --> 22:45.574
- The play, Romeo and Juliet?
- What about it?

22:45.741 --> 22:49.786
I'm Romeo. She's Juliet.
Come on, she must have told you.

22:50.621 --> 22:54.208
- She did tell you, didn't she?
- I think you'd better leave.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.213
I am so sorry. I am such a klutz.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.090
Here. On me. This should cover it.

23:02.758 --> 23:06.303
You know what? I hope for Rory's sake
that you got an understudy.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.680
- Hi. I need to talk to you.
- What is he doing here?

23:08.764 --> 23:11.642
- I got something to settle with this guy.
- Outside, please.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.727
All right! I'm outside.

23:13.936 --> 23:18.982
- Sorry I didn't tell you before, but Tristin...
- Is playing Romeo to your Juliet. I heard.

23:19.107 --> 23:22.653
He wasn't even in our group at first,
then no one else wanted him...

23:22.736 --> 23:26.490
then Paris moved our rehearsal to here,
and I didn't have time to tell you.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.659
You and Tristin get thrown together a lot.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.119
It's just a project, that's all. Nothing more.

23:31.203 --> 23:35.374
You and Tristin playing Romeo and Juliet?
Perfect. Really amazing.

23:35.499 --> 23:38.001
- I know you hate it.
- Yeah, I really hate it.

23:38.085 --> 23:40.135
But we do the scene on Sunday,
then it's over.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.756
And it's back to,
'Tristin? Who? I don't know Tristin. '

23:42.840 --> 23:45.801
You must mean that young boy
who got mysteriously strangled...

23:45.884 --> 23:49.263
- by a Doose's Market apron one night.
- I heard about that.

23:49.388 --> 23:51.932
Awful. They say drugs were involved.

23:52.641 --> 23:56.311
Please, don't be mad. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

23:56.562 --> 23:59.856
Sorry about what?
You didn't choose to do this with him.

23:59.891 --> 24:03.151
- No, I didn't.
- Then what do you have to be sorry for?

24:03.318 --> 24:07.364
That I didn't tell you about the rehearsal.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.159
And that No Doubt is touring with U2.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.703
I know you're extremely disappointed
in Bono.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.831
- All right, so when's this thing over?
- Sunday.

24:20.794 --> 24:24.214
I'm going to walk around the block.
Just get him out of the market.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.674
Right away.

24:30.554 --> 24:33.724
Thank goodness you ordered.
I am starving.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.226
What are you doing here?
I thought you went to dinner.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.854
- I did go out to dinner.
- Then why are you eating mine?

24:38.896 --> 24:41.565
He took me to this darling little place
called Mini's.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.902
- Very hip, very chic, very small portions.
- So how'd it go?

24:45.402 --> 24:49.156
We talked about the things we had
in common, and then the salad came.

24:49.364 --> 24:52.201
- Not a soul mate?
- He's never seen Abfab.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.078
Plus, he's outdoorsy.
Remember that Meryl Streep movie...

24:55.162 --> 24:57.372
where she and her family
take a rafting trip...

24:57.414 --> 25:00.542
and psycho Kevin Bacon forces them
to take him down the river?

25:00.667 --> 25:03.420
That's his dream vacation,
minus Kevin Bacon.

25:03.462 --> 25:06.173
Whereas mine is Kevin Bacon,
minus the river.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.591
Moving on.

25:07.633 --> 25:10.344
But I must say,
I'm really glad I went tonight.

25:11.512 --> 25:14.598
It was fun to kind of get dressed up...

25:14.681 --> 25:17.976
and have a freshly laundered man
open the door for me.

25:18.143 --> 25:21.104
And the best part about it was,
it was no big deal.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.983
We laughed a little, we hugged good night.
I'll never date him again.

25:25.067 --> 25:29.613
But I do believe the burrito bit will live on.
It was a totally casual date.

25:29.780 --> 25:33.033
- I am now officially a casual dater.
- That's great.

25:33.075 --> 25:36.411
We can celebrate by getting you
your own plate of fries.

25:36.662 --> 25:39.790
- Luke, can we get another round?
- Coming right up.

25:39.915 --> 25:43.293
- So tell me about the big rehearsal.
- We got off to a shaky start.

25:43.335 --> 25:46.630
Louise acts like she's the priest
in a Madonna video.

25:46.672 --> 25:49.383
- But by the end we were not half bad.
- Good.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.219
- Tristin ran into Dean.
- Bad.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.806
I pulled them apart without bloodshed
and explained it all to Dean.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.224
You explained it all to Dean?

25:57.349 --> 25:59.852
I told him Tristin wasn't supposed to be
in our group...

25:59.935 --> 26:02.813
and Paris moved the rehearsal
to Miss Patty's at the last minute...

26:02.855 --> 26:04.523
and that's why didn't know about it.

26:04.558 --> 26:06.316
That version of 'all. '

26:06.608 --> 26:08.534
- But Dean's fine now?
- He's fine.

26:08.569 --> 26:11.572
- You want a burger, too?
- No, I'll just have half of hers.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.615
- One burger, please.
- You look all dressed up.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.076
Do I? Because I feel very casual.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.540
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:21.665 --> 26:23.542
- You just get off work?
- Yep.

26:23.584 --> 26:26.503
- Do you want some fries?
- No, I'm going home for dinner.

26:26.538 --> 26:29.381
My mom made fried chicken,
and she saved me some.

26:29.590 --> 26:31.550
- You have a cooking mom.
- That's so nice.

26:31.675 --> 26:34.553
She may make chicken,
but is she a casual dater?

26:34.636 --> 26:35.846
I hope not. She's married.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.056
Do I want to know
what you're talking about?

26:38.140 --> 26:40.684
- Nope.
- My mother casually dated tonight.

26:40.976 --> 26:43.478
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

26:43.687 --> 26:46.481
I was just wondering
what time rehearsal is tomorrow.

26:46.607 --> 26:47.691
Why?

26:47.733 --> 26:50.861
It's my night off,
and I thought maybe I'd come and watch.

26:50.896 --> 26:52.529
- Watch what?
- Watch you.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.032
- Watch me do what?
- Rehearse.

26:57.409 --> 27:00.496
I think you'd be really bored
watching rehearsal.

27:00.537 --> 27:03.499
I've dozed off twice just listening
to her talk about rehearsal.

27:03.624 --> 27:04.708
I won't be bored.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.252
We don't know our lines yet.
You should come on Sunday.

27:07.287 --> 27:10.339
Good idea.
After all, Sunday's the day of rest...

27:10.380 --> 27:13.509
and that's what you'll be doing.
Resting. Because it's boring.

27:13.592 --> 27:16.178
It's not your fault.
You didn't write the damn thing.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.686
I'll come on Sunday, too.

27:17.721 --> 27:21.475
But if you're going to go on Sunday,
you don't want to spoil it for yourself.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.193
- It's not like I don't know how it ends.
- Okay, look.

27:24.228 --> 27:27.814
Rory, I'll sit in the back,
you'll die, and I'll walk you home.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.900
- It's no big deal, right?
- Right.

27:30.025 --> 27:32.152
Good. So I'll see you tomorrow.

27:32.194 --> 27:34.071
Yep, you sure will.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.281
- Bye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Dean.

27:39.743 --> 27:42.579
Oh, yeah. He's fine.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.962
Excuse me, Tristin,
can I talk to you for a second?

27:50.420 --> 27:52.756
I'll meet you guys later, okay?

27:53.757 --> 27:55.050
I'm all yours.

27:55.133 --> 27:58.554
- I need talk about something serious.
- Serious? I'm intrigued.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.014
Dean's coming to rehearsal tonight.

28:01.139 --> 28:04.518
Are you sure they can spare him?
What if there's a run on baked beans?

28:04.601 --> 28:08.105
Can't you shut up for five seconds,
please? Thank you.

28:08.647 --> 28:11.191
As I said, Dean's coming
to rehearsal tonight...

28:11.233 --> 28:14.903
and I'd like you to promise you won't say
anything about what happened.

28:14.945 --> 28:16.780
- What happened?
- At the party?

28:16.864 --> 28:20.742
- At the party?
- You and me, at Madeline's party?

28:20.951 --> 28:22.995
You had been kicked to the curb
by Summer...

28:23.078 --> 28:26.498
and I found you sulking on a piano bench,
and I sat down, we talked...

28:26.582 --> 28:29.084
and then we kissed.

28:29.418 --> 28:32.212
- That was you?
- You know what? Forget it.

28:33.797 --> 28:34.798
Hey, Rory...

28:34.923 --> 28:38.802
There's no point in talking to you.
I knew, yet I tried. Won't happen again.

28:38.886 --> 28:41.013
You don't want me to tell Dean
that we kissed.

28:41.048 --> 28:42.437
By George, I think he's got it.

28:42.472 --> 28:45.100
- Okay, if that's what you want.
- It is.

28:45.184 --> 28:47.832
- Although he's going to find out anyway.
- What?

28:47.867 --> 28:50.425
Come on,
you know that when we kiss on stage...

28:50.460 --> 28:52.983
it's going to be obvious
it's not the first time.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.868
I'm a good actor,
but I can't hide that kind of passion.

28:55.903 --> 29:00.449
Things are really good for me and Dean,
and I don't want anything to mess that up.

29:00.491 --> 29:03.035
Especially not something
that meant nothing to me...

29:03.076 --> 29:05.954
and I wish had never happened
in the first place.

29:05.996 --> 29:08.957
- So things are going good for you two?
- Yeah, they are.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.834
Good. That's good.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.465
So what do you think?

29:16.632 --> 29:19.176
- You just took those out.
- I changed my mind.

29:19.211 --> 29:20.302
Are you all right?

29:20.385 --> 29:24.097
I think I'll recover from the great romance
between you and the Beav.

29:24.473 --> 29:26.767
A lot of stuff's been going on
with you lately, huh?

29:26.850 --> 29:28.060
Meaning?

29:28.185 --> 29:31.313
The car thing, the suspension thing.
A lot of drama.

29:31.396 --> 29:33.190
I get bored easily.

29:33.398 --> 29:36.360
- Just doesn't really seem like you.
- And you know me?

29:36.395 --> 29:38.570
I know you don't get suspended
for dumb pranks.

29:38.654 --> 29:41.365
I pulled stuff like that
before I knew Duncan and Bowman.

29:41.406 --> 29:44.368
If you did, you didn't get caught.
You're getting caught a lot.

29:44.409 --> 29:45.410
Your point being?

29:45.536 --> 29:47.746
They aren't the best people
to be hanging out with.

29:47.913 --> 29:50.916
They're not as smart as you.
They don't have what you have going.

29:51.041 --> 29:54.211
I have to bail,
before we get to the hugging part.

29:54.670 --> 29:58.423
And ask your boyfriend to remind me
when it's coupon day, okay?

30:02.386 --> 30:04.721
- Taking pity on your burger?
- I'm not hungry.

30:04.805 --> 30:07.432
You're going to kill yourself
in a couple of hours.

30:07.467 --> 30:09.017
You really need your strength.

30:09.101 --> 30:11.603
- Maybe Dean won't even come tonight.
- He'll be there.

30:11.687 --> 30:15.148
There aren't enough monster-truck rallies
in the world to keep him away.

30:15.232 --> 30:18.318
All right. That's it.
This afternoon, we are going to engage...

30:18.360 --> 30:21.363
in some intensive retail therapy
to bring you out of this funk.

30:21.446 --> 30:22.865
- No, thanks.
- I mean it.

30:22.906 --> 30:26.743
Today is the day we finally spring
for the Powerpuff Girls shot glasses.

30:26.785 --> 30:30.080
I can't. I promised Lane I'd help her
pick out an outfit for the play.

30:30.205 --> 30:32.214
- Lorelai?
- Yes?

30:32.249 --> 30:35.502
Hey, it is you! This is Lorelai.
She's the girl I told you about.

30:36.128 --> 30:39.464
Paul! I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you with the hat.

30:39.548 --> 30:41.967
- What are you doing here?
- Getting some coffee.

30:42.050 --> 30:43.051
In Stars Hollow?

30:43.093 --> 30:46.722
You talked so much about the town
the other night, especially Luke's place.

30:46.805 --> 30:49.850
My mom's crazy for coffee.
I thought I'd bring them for breakfast.

30:49.892 --> 30:53.437
- The other night?
- PauI's referring to the casual Wednesday.

30:54.396 --> 30:57.399
- I want you to meet my daughter, Rory.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

30:57.434 --> 31:00.110
- These are my parents, Dory and Sid.
- Nice to meet you.

31:00.145 --> 31:01.862
- Pleasure, really.
- Yeah, me, too.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.822
- You ordering?
- Luke?

31:03.947 --> 31:06.325
- Are you Luke? Is this Luke?
- Yes, that's Luke.

31:06.450 --> 31:10.996
- Oh, man! Mom, Dad, that is Luke.
- We heard so much about you.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.123
Darn shame about that Rachel.

31:13.165 --> 31:17.044
- Who the hell are these people?
- Paul is my friend from business school.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.295
We went out the other night.

31:18.337 --> 31:22.049
She talked about a few people
in this town, you being one of them.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.759
So, nice to meet you.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.801
Yeah.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.513
Three coffees to go, then.

31:27.638 --> 31:28.931
- Something funny?
- No.

31:28.972 --> 31:31.642
- You're smiling for no reason?
- I'm a happy person.

31:31.677 --> 31:33.852
I've got to run.
Mom wants to go antiquing.

31:33.936 --> 31:37.481
So it was nice meeting you.
And I'll see you in class, Lorelai.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.238
- What? Say it!
- Nothing.

31:44.321 --> 31:47.491
- I always wanted a little brother.
- He looked older the other night.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.827
- How much older could he possibly look?
- A lot.

31:49.868 --> 31:53.831
He's usually scruffy. The baseball cap
hides the funky-hair thing.

31:53.997 --> 31:56.166
He should have been holding a yo-yo,
a lollipop...

31:56.201 --> 31:58.168
and wearing a beanie
with a propeller on it.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.468
He's in his 20s.

31:59.503 --> 32:02.422
He must have been a very good boy
to deserve such a happy day.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.843
- I bet they let him ride a pony.
- Aren't you supposed to go help Lane?

32:05.884 --> 32:07.845
Thanks for cheering me up.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.433
- What? You want to say something, too?
- No.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.602
- Don't hold back on my account.
- I wouldn't.

32:15.644 --> 32:17.771
Would you guys mind moving down
a couple stools?

32:17.896 --> 32:19.439
It'd make me more comfortable.

32:19.565 --> 32:22.484
- This is me leaving.
- I want to know what the cutoff is.

32:22.519 --> 32:23.944
And no tip. I wonder why.

32:24.027 --> 32:27.531
If you had one of those height bars,
like at amusement-park rides...

32:27.566 --> 32:28.574
Bye, now.

32:29.658 --> 32:31.368
Here's to my love.

32:34.496 --> 32:38.125
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

32:39.585 --> 32:40.752
Line.

32:41.170 --> 32:44.089
'Thus with a kiss I die. '
How hard is that to remember?

32:44.173 --> 32:47.384
'Thus with a kiss I die. ' Right.
And then I kiss her, right?

32:47.426 --> 32:51.722
Yes, you say, 'Thus with a kiss I die,'
then you kiss her and die.

32:51.930 --> 32:54.433
Why are you smiling?
Do you think this is a joke?

32:54.474 --> 32:57.144
- The performance is tomorrow.
- Wait, tomorrow?

32:57.394 --> 33:00.334
My God! I totally missed it
the first 47 times you said it.

33:00.369 --> 33:03.275
I warned you. I am not going to fail this
because of you.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.403
- I will replace you with Brad in a second.
- Dear God, no.

33:06.438 --> 33:08.864
- Can we just get through the scene?
- Please.

33:08.906 --> 33:11.783
Fine. But yell 'line' once more,
and you're out.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.535
Start memorizing.

33:13.744 --> 33:17.206
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

33:17.748 --> 33:20.000
Thus with a kiss I die.

33:23.837 --> 33:26.507
- What?
- It's just...

33:26.757 --> 33:30.260
With this being our last kiss,
it makes me think about our first kiss.

33:30.302 --> 33:33.347
- You know, at the party.
- What?

33:33.972 --> 33:36.183
- Lie down, you're dead.
- We all are.

33:36.266 --> 33:37.851
You remember the kiss.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.771
In Act One, at the Capulets' masked party.

33:40.854 --> 33:41.862
What about it?

33:41.897 --> 33:45.859
I was trying to think of something
that would make this kiss as special.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.486
- I thought she could cry.
- What?

33:47.528 --> 33:50.572
- She's dead. You're dead. Lie down.
- But that's the beauty of it.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.741
- No one would expect her to cry.
- I would.

33:52.866 --> 33:55.828
- Funny you should say that.
- I need to take five.

33:55.911 --> 33:56.954
Let's all take five.

33:56.995 --> 33:59.498
That way, you can all cancel
whatever plans you had...

33:59.540 --> 34:02.793
because we are staying here
until we get this right.

34:02.835 --> 34:04.962
Who could you possibly be calling?

34:05.504 --> 34:07.464
He is unbelievable.

34:07.548 --> 34:10.349
- Dean, I really need you to leave.
- What?

34:10.384 --> 34:13.719
The play's tomorrow,
and it's 50% of my grade...

34:13.804 --> 34:17.516
and you standing there staring at Tristin,
it's like a challenge.

34:17.558 --> 34:19.608
I don't like the way he's messing with you.

34:19.643 --> 34:22.145
I don't either,
but we have to get through the scene...

34:22.187 --> 34:26.149
and we can't with you standing there,
so, Dean, please?

34:27.192 --> 34:28.318
Fine.

34:30.195 --> 34:31.905
Call me later.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.434
You know, I notice you didn't cry
when you kissed him.

34:40.469 --> 34:43.297
- I'm starting to feel insecure.
- What is wrong with you?

34:43.333 --> 34:46.920
- I think I liked you better comatose.
- You weren't going to say anything.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.137
Did I say that?

34:48.172 --> 34:50.841
You make it impossible
for anyone to be nice to you.

34:50.882 --> 34:52.342
No wonder you had to join our group.

34:52.467 --> 34:56.346
Anyone who's suffered the experience
of going out with you would know better.

34:56.429 --> 34:59.933
I really wish we could continue
your analysis on how pathetic I am.

35:00.017 --> 35:03.061
Unfortunately,
I have to meet some friends.

35:03.478 --> 35:05.939
Where are you going? Where is he going?

35:06.148 --> 35:08.692
We're not finished! I'm the director here!

35:09.860 --> 35:11.320
Tristin, come back!

35:16.241 --> 35:19.912
I'm so excited.
Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet.

35:19.953 --> 35:22.956
It's so romantic. 'Oh, Romeo... '

35:26.960 --> 35:29.630
That's all the Shakespeare I know.

35:29.671 --> 35:32.007
You should come with us
and watch Rory perform.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.133
Can't.

35:33.175 --> 35:36.261
How often do you get to see teenagers
speak iambic pentameter...

35:36.345 --> 35:38.896
- and kill themselves?
- No, thanks. But have a good time.

35:38.931 --> 35:42.100
Bring plenty of baseball cards
to pass out your phone number on.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.978
Enough already! The horse is dead.

35:45.062 --> 35:47.898
His ashes have been sprinkled
over the land. Let it rest.

35:47.940 --> 35:51.443
Lorelai, there you are, you naughty girl.

35:52.778 --> 35:55.239
He was not that much younger than I am.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.908
I met him at business school,
not his bar mitzvah.

35:57.991 --> 36:00.953
Business school has to indicate
some kind of maturity, right?

36:00.994 --> 36:04.081
- Doogie Howser was a doctor at 16.
- Doogie Howser was not real.

36:04.116 --> 36:05.415
How sad for you.

36:06.834 --> 36:10.629
This is incredible. I go on one stupid date,
and I'm the female Jerry Lee Lewis.

36:10.754 --> 36:15.342
Forget it, honey. The town likes to tease.
Plus, he did look really young.

36:15.425 --> 36:18.136
- You didn't even see him.
- Kirk snapped pictures.

36:20.472 --> 36:24.101
- Hey, you. What is up with you?
- Nothing's up with me.

36:24.226 --> 36:26.812
We were having
a perfectly nasty verbal sparring match...

36:26.937 --> 36:29.523
- and you suddenly walk away?
- I hear you're dating a kid.

36:29.558 --> 36:31.400
Please, let something big fall on my head.

36:31.525 --> 36:34.820
When I was 18, I was dating
an older lady. Broke my heart.

36:34.945 --> 36:37.948
I'm sorry you got dumped,
but I'm not dating a kid.

36:37.990 --> 36:41.451
I didn't get dumped. She died.
Heart attack. She was quite old.

36:41.493 --> 36:45.622
- I'm working. Us older guys do that.
- Why are you being so mean to me?

36:45.664 --> 36:48.000
- I'm not being mean.
- Yes, you are.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.168
Am I being mean?

36:49.251 --> 36:52.504
I wouldn't pay you to put on a red nose
and work a birthday party now.

36:52.588 --> 36:53.547
Thank God for that.

36:53.630 --> 36:56.341
- Why are you so mad at me?
- I just think it's embarrassing.

36:56.425 --> 36:59.469
- What is so embarrassing?
- You running around with that kid.

36:59.504 --> 37:02.055
I wasn't running. He's not a kid.
We had dinner.

37:02.139 --> 37:04.099
Say 'Chuck E. Cheese,'
I'll break your nose.

37:04.141 --> 37:07.019
I'm not going to say anything.
Live your life as you please.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.770
I got work to do.

37:14.318 --> 37:17.112
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

37:17.446 --> 37:20.824
But soft! What light
through yonder window breaks?

37:21.200 --> 37:24.453
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

37:24.495 --> 37:27.664
- Are you sure this is Shakespeare?
- What's with all the grunting?

37:27.706 --> 37:30.375
I wish Luke was here.
He could translate for us.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.794
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

37:32.836 --> 37:34.922
Look at you. You look like a princess.

37:34.963 --> 37:36.507
Doesn't she look like a princess?

37:36.548 --> 37:39.009
- Yeah, she looks beautiful.
- Mom made the dress.

37:39.051 --> 37:41.595
- Not to mention the girl inside it.
- Hello! Gross!

37:41.637 --> 37:43.972
- I'm just saying.
- I'm getting kind of nervous.

37:44.014 --> 37:46.308
- You're going to be great.
- Act Three is starting.

37:46.350 --> 37:48.108
Henry's act. How do I look?

37:48.143 --> 37:52.314
You might want to hold a phone
up to your face, so he'll recognize you.

37:52.814 --> 37:54.191
I need you.

37:54.816 --> 37:56.527
- He's not here.
- Who's not here?

37:56.652 --> 37:59.905
I've called his home, his cell.
I called three girls he's seeing.

38:00.030 --> 38:01.865
- Calm down.
- Weren't you listening?

38:01.907 --> 38:04.993
He's not here. We're on in 20 minutes,
and we don't have a Romeo.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.662
- We are going to fail.
- We're not.

38:06.703 --> 38:09.373
Do you think Harvard accepts people
who fail Shakespeare?

38:09.414 --> 38:12.251
I don't have numbers on it,
but I feel secure in saying...

38:12.286 --> 38:14.419
you fail Shakespeare,
you don't get into Harvard.

38:14.545 --> 38:16.839
Maybe he's in one
of the bathrooms, smoking.

38:16.922 --> 38:20.467
You check the east men's rooms,
I'll check the west ones.

38:27.724 --> 38:31.061
I am hurt. A plague on both your houses!

38:31.228 --> 38:34.565
I am sped. Is he gone, and hath nothing?

38:34.731 --> 38:37.484
I knew he was going to do this,
but no one wanted to listen.

38:37.609 --> 38:40.320
- 'Let's make Tristin Romeo. He's hot. '
- What about Brad?

38:40.404 --> 38:42.573
Brad transferred schools.
Where have you been?

38:42.614 --> 38:44.575
Get dressed. We're on in 10 minutes.

38:44.658 --> 38:45.909
- Can't.
- What?

38:46.326 --> 38:48.579
My dad had me pulled out of school.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.416
And is she unhappy.

38:52.541 --> 38:55.460
What do you mean,
he had you pulled out of school?

38:55.502 --> 38:58.380
Just ticked the old man off, that's all.

38:58.415 --> 39:01.258
By doing what? Tristin, come on, tell me.

39:01.293 --> 39:02.759
I got in some trouble.

39:02.801 --> 39:06.013
- Trouble involving...
- Involving Duncan and Bowman.

39:06.638 --> 39:09.266
- And Bowman's dad's safe.
- Oh, no.

39:09.349 --> 39:12.769
Bowman had a key.
It was supposed to be no big deal.

39:12.895 --> 39:17.274
- Then the crazy silent alarm kicked in.
- You broke into Bowman's dad's safe?

39:17.482 --> 39:19.151
- Yes.
- Stupid.

39:20.569 --> 39:24.573
Okay. You can apologize,
and you can put back the money...

39:24.615 --> 39:27.659
and you can explain
that you were going through something.

39:27.701 --> 39:30.537
I was. I was going through his safe.

39:30.746 --> 39:33.123
- Why would you do this?
- I don't know.

39:33.165 --> 39:35.792
I guess that's something I can ponder
at military school.

39:35.827 --> 39:37.085
Military school?

39:37.211 --> 39:39.171
The police
are letting our parents handle it.

39:39.296 --> 39:42.424
In my case, that means military school
in North Carolina.

39:42.466 --> 39:43.932
I don't know what to say.

39:43.967 --> 39:48.388
I imagine you're overwhelmed at the relief
in knowing that soon I will be gone.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.557
I'm so sorry.

39:50.974 --> 39:54.019
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

39:54.102 --> 39:56.313
- There's nothing you can...
- Tristin...

39:56.396 --> 39:57.648
come on.

40:00.275 --> 40:01.693
I've got to go.

40:07.407 --> 40:09.701
I'd like to kiss you goodbye...

40:11.578 --> 40:13.622
but your boyfriend's watching.

40:14.998 --> 40:18.001
Take care of yourself, Mary.

40:25.217 --> 40:27.553
What are you standing there for? Let's go!

40:27.678 --> 40:30.556
And you better start sucking on an Altoid.

40:30.681 --> 40:33.684
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

40:34.101 --> 40:37.479
Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavory guide.

40:37.729 --> 40:40.774
Thou desperate pilot, now at once
run on the dashing rocks...

40:40.816 --> 40:43.861
thy seasick weary bark. Here's to my love!

40:48.323 --> 40:52.244
O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.

40:52.995 --> 40:54.955
Thus with a kiss...

40:55.914 --> 40:56.957
I die.

40:59.877 --> 41:03.213
Wasn't that great?
Just watching it made me feel smarter.

41:03.255 --> 41:06.008
- Don't you feel smarter?
- Just the opposite, actually.

41:06.091 --> 41:09.219
Let's do something else good for us.
Go to a museum or play chess.

41:09.254 --> 41:10.762
I promised Rory we'd go to Luke's.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.097
Even better.

41:12.139 --> 41:15.726
I am still pretty peeved
by how he acted earlier.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.728
- That guy runs so hot and cold on me.
- What?

41:17.769 --> 41:21.690
One minute, he's all sweet.
The next, he's being a total jerk...

41:21.732 --> 41:24.401
- for God knows what reason.
- For God knows what reason?

41:24.443 --> 41:26.570
- Come on, Lorelai.
- What?

41:26.987 --> 41:29.406
Don't you understand
that Luke is so into you?

41:29.490 --> 41:30.532
Okay, stop.

41:30.616 --> 41:33.368
He has had to watch you go
from one guy to another...

41:33.494 --> 41:35.996
and then the engagement,
and then it was off.

41:36.205 --> 41:39.416
And patiently, he's waited,
and now in walks this kid...

41:39.541 --> 41:42.544
and he says, 'My God,
will she date anyone else in the world...

41:42.669 --> 41:44.838
- 'before she'll date me?'
- Sookie, that's...

41:44.963 --> 41:48.091
Maybe it's crazy, maybe it's irrational,
but it's there.

41:48.175 --> 41:50.969
Just look the guy in the eye.
It's right there.

41:53.972 --> 41:57.392
So did you and Paris actually kiss,
or was that, like, a stage thing?

41:57.434 --> 41:59.603
A lady never kisses and tells.

41:59.728 --> 42:02.231
You guys get a table. I'll be right there.

42:08.111 --> 42:09.488
How'd it go?

42:09.863 --> 42:13.283
- I think Shakespeare will recover.
- That's good.

42:14.243 --> 42:16.787
- Are you good at dating?
- What?

42:17.454 --> 42:19.248
Dating. Do you have that down?

42:19.331 --> 42:23.377
- Okay, if this is about that kid...
- It's not about anything. It's a question.

42:23.460 --> 42:25.128
I don't know if I have it down.

42:25.254 --> 42:28.841
Considering I live with my nephew,
I'd say probably not.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.634
I don't have it down either.

42:30.759 --> 42:34.054
I've never been very good at it.
Never even really liked it.

42:34.179 --> 42:38.016
It's too much 'what if. '
I like things I can count on.

42:41.436 --> 42:44.857
Actually, with Max, it was the first time
I was finally like:

42:45.023 --> 42:48.819
'Here it is. That one person
who will always be there for me. '

42:50.070 --> 42:53.323
And then I turned around,
and it's suddenly:

42:54.449 --> 42:56.160
'Wrong. '

42:57.828 --> 43:00.747
- 'Keep moving. '
- Why are you telling me this?

43:01.206 --> 43:03.709
I don't have very many people in my life...

43:04.543 --> 43:06.670
who are in my life...

43:08.463 --> 43:09.923
permanently, forever.

43:10.007 --> 43:13.760
They will always be there for me.
I will always be there for them.

43:15.846 --> 43:19.975
There's Rory and Sookie, this town...

43:21.143 --> 43:22.269
and you.

43:23.478 --> 43:26.356
- I mean, at least I think I've got...
- You do.

43:27.357 --> 43:28.275
Good.

43:30.110 --> 43:31.612
Just checking.

43:33.697 --> 43:36.950
Tell me about Romeo and Juliet.

43:39.912 --> 43:43.749
It's so depressing. Everybody dies.
But the clothes were so cute.

43:43.784 --> 43:46.668
- Life can be funny that way.
- And Rory...

44:26.834 --> 44:27.876
English

44:28.305 --> 44:34.772
