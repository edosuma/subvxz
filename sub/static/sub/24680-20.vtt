00:00.810 --> 00:03.382
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.382 --> 00:08.446
the worst criminal offenders are pursued
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.446 --> 00:10.188
These are their stories.

00:13.176 --> 00:16.306
It's not anywhere.
We can't bury Mom without it.

00:16.306 --> 00:19.313
Uh, Danielle, I told you.
She's not being buried.

00:19.564 --> 00:21.308
Come on, Lawrence.

00:25.999 --> 00:28.374
Pauline looked so peaceful when she passed.

00:28.374 --> 00:30.740
I only wish I could've gotten to her sooner.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.982
Some things are still out of our hands, Doctor.

00:32.982 --> 00:35.865
- Apparently.
- Here you are, Doctor.

00:37.803 --> 00:39.728
This is Lawrence,
my fiance.

00:39.728 --> 00:41.001
How are you doing, Doctor?

00:41.001 --> 00:43.221
Janette's told me all about you.

00:43.491 --> 00:45.825
I didn't say they were thieves,

00:45.825 --> 00:49.308
but maybe they saw it when 
they picked my mother up.

00:49.308 --> 00:51.784
I just wanna talk to them.

00:51.912 --> 00:54.190
Please.
She can't be buried without that ring.

00:54.190 --> 00:56.336
I will talk with my employees.

00:56.336 --> 00:57.652
And as far as a burial?

00:57.652 --> 00:59.373
That's not what we have down for your mother.

00:59.373 --> 01:01.136
I don't care what you have down.

01:01.136 --> 01:03.410
She's getting a burial.

01:04.825 --> 01:06.359
I'm not accusing Janette.

01:06.359 --> 01:08.905
- But her fiance...
- Right. Lawrence...

01:08.905 --> 01:11.319
the one with the criminal record.

01:11.319 --> 01:15.045
Now, this local number for you,
it's good until when?

01:15.045 --> 01:18.819
Maybe a week.
Then I'm goin' back to Baltimore.

01:18.931 --> 01:21.061
This ring was very important to my mother.

01:21.061 --> 01:22.714
I'll look into it.

01:22.876 --> 01:25.603
Now, if it should turn up
in the meantime, Miss Pearce,

01:25.603 --> 01:28.112
you be sure to call me.

01:28.461 --> 01:30.341
If you could talk to her, Doctor.

01:30.341 --> 01:31.997
I don't want to cause her trouble.

01:31.997 --> 01:33.708
Danielle, you went to the police.

01:33.708 --> 01:36.003
Wouldn't you call that causing her trouble?

01:36.003 --> 01:39.004
Doctor, will you talk to my sister about the ring?

01:39.004 --> 01:41.567
Please, she'll listen to you.

01:42.484 --> 01:44.800
I'll do what I can.

01:45.624 --> 01:48.062
Larry, you got a personal call.

01:48.953 --> 01:51.184
Said he's a detective.

01:53.131 --> 01:55.559
This is Larry Belling.

01:55.835 --> 01:59.538
Hello? Hello.

Hey, watch out!

02:33.385 --> 02:37.594
Call 911! They ran her over!
Three of'em! I saw 'em!

02:37.594 --> 02:39.417
- What happened?
- They killed her.

Law & Order CI 
3x20. D.A.W

03:20.188 --> 03:22.686
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/05/16

03:29.759 --> 03:32.131
One victim: Three hit-and-runs.
Has to be a record.

03:32.131 --> 03:34.348
That's why we're here.
Anybody get the license plates?

03:34.348 --> 03:39.324
No. First car tried to avoid her,
but the other two swerved into her lane.

03:39.679 --> 03:42.571
Witness said they were goin' 
around a car in the intersection.

03:42.571 --> 03:46.043
There's vomit in her shirt.
Probably happened before the impact.

03:46.043 --> 03:50.363
Train ticket: Baltimore-New York,
four days ago.

03:51.234 --> 03:53.499
We got needle marks.

03:54.506 --> 03:56.878
They're healed... scarred over.

03:56.878 --> 03:59.979
- She hasn't used in a long time.
- Until tonight.

03:59.979 --> 04:03.328
The vomit, the foaming...
she overdosed?

04:03.328 --> 04:06.406
Fingernails on her right hand are broken off.

04:06.406 --> 04:09.944
The car that blocked the intersection...
it came from the underpass?

04:11.594 --> 04:13.706
Fresh vomit here.

04:14.283 --> 04:16.495
It's a broken fingernail.

04:20.481 --> 04:23.851
The vomit, it-it fell in her shirt.

04:25.469 --> 04:31.568
She might've been sitting in a car on the 
passenger side when she was overdosing.

04:32.804 --> 04:35.305
She tried to get out.

04:36.230 --> 04:39.765
She broke her nails 
grabbing at the door latch.

04:39.765 --> 04:44.170
She gets out, throws up,
wanders into the street.

04:44.170 --> 04:46.250
If she was in a car,

04:47.528 --> 04:49.933
it could be the same one in the intersection.

04:49.933 --> 04:51.590
Detectives.

04:51.712 --> 04:55.003
One of the hit-and-run 
drivers turned himself in.

04:55.580 --> 05:01.042
I thought I had run over an 
animal or a garbage bag.

05:01.042 --> 05:04.966
I just... The guy in front of me had already run over it.

05:04.966 --> 05:07.595
And in that neighborhood, l...

05:07.748 --> 05:09.318
You didn't wanna stop and check.

05:09.318 --> 05:11.680
Well, no. I didn't.

05:11.680 --> 05:17.163
So you swerved into the right lane
to avoid hitting a car in the intersection.

05:17.163 --> 05:18.495
Yes.

05:18.495 --> 05:19.962
Was this car moving?

05:19.962 --> 05:22.116
No. I saw it from a distance.

05:22.116 --> 05:23.945
It was a dark-colored car,

05:23.945 --> 05:27.028
and it had nosed into the left lane...

05:27.028 --> 05:29.057
and just stopped for no reason.

05:29.057 --> 05:32.551
It just stopped... for no reason.

05:32.551 --> 05:34.422
Yes.

05:35.539 --> 05:38.487
And then, I had to go around it.

05:41.106 --> 05:44.003
All right, Mr. Lafond.
We're done with you.

05:44.003 --> 05:48.320
The Accident Investigation 
Unit will want to talk to you.

05:55.969 --> 05:58.389
The first impact, uh,

05:58.910 --> 06:01.996
it didn't... kill her.

06:03.820 --> 06:07.736
The other cars...
might have avoided her...

06:07.736 --> 06:11.586
if this car hadn't blocked the left lane.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.322
But it just sat there...

06:15.944 --> 06:19.614
to make sure that she got hit.

06:21.206 --> 06:24.888
The M.E. Found a fresh needle 
mark on the left side of her abdomen,

06:24.888 --> 06:28.027
not the obvious place 
for a junkie to shoot up.

06:28.027 --> 06:32.395
But somebody sitting next to her,
they might have put the needle into her.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.787
Maybe they tried to kill her with an overdose.

06:37.953 --> 06:42.448
She got away, and they 
made sure the traffic got her.

06:43.116 --> 06:45.511
Baltimore P.D. Got a hit on the prints.

06:45.511 --> 06:48.904
Danielle Pearce, 32,
part-time schoolteacher.

06:48.904 --> 06:51.747
She had a drug beef two years ago.
Her mother lives uptown.

06:51.747 --> 06:53.210
Detective.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.280
It's the tox report.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.688
Positive for heroin.

07:00.761 --> 07:02.964
APARTMENT OF JANETTE PEARCE
157 WEST 133RD STREET
THURSDAY, APRIL 8

07:02.964 --> 07:04.688
They had the wake three days ago.

07:04.688 --> 07:05.927
They were supposed to have everything...

07:05.927 --> 07:08.506
packed up and cleared 
out by the end of next week.

07:08.506 --> 07:11.212
You pretty much see everything
that goes on around here.

07:11.212 --> 07:12.506
Yes, I do.

07:12.506 --> 07:14.129
Did you see the younger daughter yesterday?

07:14.129 --> 07:17.847
Yes.
Her and her sister, out on the landing.

07:17.847 --> 07:19.544
Pretty much hear everything too, huh?

07:19.544 --> 07:24.640
Well, the younger girl was 
making trouble forJanette's fiance.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.573
I don't know what.

07:26.573 --> 07:31.014
Mrs. Pearce ever say 
anything about this fiance?

07:31.710 --> 07:34.705
Well, she didn't think 
Lawrence was much of a catch.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.777
I mean, he's a car jockey in a parking garage.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.492
Thank you, Mr. Hawks.

07:40.492 --> 07:43.070
We'll check in with you before we leave.

07:44.317 --> 07:47.279
Looks like there was more 
searching than packing going on.

07:47.279 --> 07:50.572
That stack over there looks like Mom's jewelry...

07:50.572 --> 07:54.801
gold ring, pearls,
the rest looks like paste.

07:58.152 --> 08:00.465
"Suzanne Belperron."

08:00.822 --> 08:03.688
She was a jewelry designer in the 1930s.

08:03.688 --> 08:05.775
This stuff is very valuable.

08:05.775 --> 08:08.126
This doesn't look like one of her pieces.

08:17.743 --> 08:19.871
But this does.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.412
Somebody switched the rings in the box.

08:23.794 --> 08:27.468
Danielle, my sweet baby.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.967
Somebody must've done somethin' to her.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.775
She wouldn't get high.
She was clean.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.808
She had been in a program...

08:36.808 --> 08:38.816
since last year.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.991
The super at your mother's apartment...

08:42.991 --> 08:47.074
said he heard you and 
Danielle talking yesterday.

08:47.074 --> 08:52.388
We had an argument over 
my mother's things. It's silly.

08:52.388 --> 08:55.331
The argument between you and your sister...

08:55.331 --> 08:58.112
was about a specific thing.

08:58.112 --> 09:01.795
A ring. We couldn't find it.

09:02.128 --> 09:03.819
Is this the one?

09:05.661 --> 09:07.219
Yes.

09:07.858 --> 09:11.731
It was my great-grandmother's 
25th anniversary ring.

09:11.731 --> 09:13.638
The ring isn't worth much,

09:13.638 --> 09:15.837
just sentimental.

09:16.303 --> 09:20.484
All those... emeralds and rubies...

09:20.484 --> 09:23.028
it is very valuable.

09:23.028 --> 09:26.863
It was made by a well-known French designer.

09:27.115 --> 09:32.611
The super said that he overheard you say 
that Danielle was making trouble for Lawrence.

09:32.611 --> 09:36.221
She accused him of taking the ring.
She's wrong.

09:36.221 --> 09:38.506
But she had a detective call him at work.

09:38.506 --> 09:40.386
And what did you say to the detective?

09:40.386 --> 09:41.858
Nothin; By the time I got to the phone,

09:41.858 --> 09:44.713
he had already hung up, and 
he didn't leave a name or a number.

09:44.713 --> 09:48.133
Uh, I'm sorry. How-How did 
you know he was a detective?

09:48.133 --> 09:51.414
He told my boss when he answered.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.428
Did Danielle say she went to the police?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.447
Yes, to a precinct on Broadway.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.040
31ST POLICE PRECINCT
80 EAST 131ST STREET
FRIDAY, APRIL 9

10:02.040 --> 10:06.058
He had a pretty common name...
no birth date, no social.

10:06.058 --> 10:09.310
I had his complaint on my desk
this morning if you just give me a minute.

10:09.310 --> 10:12.314
Did you send a description
of the ring to the N.C.I.C.?

10:12.314 --> 10:15.098
I was gonna get to that today.

10:17.728 --> 10:21.572
Maybe it was because you 
saw the tracks on her arm?

10:23.273 --> 10:26.444
You didn't actually write it up, did you?

10:27.466 --> 10:29.708
I thought the ring would just show up.

10:29.708 --> 10:33.261
- A $200 ring.
- Try 30,000.

10:34.541 --> 10:37.035
That's a lot of money to put in the ground.

10:37.035 --> 10:38.257
Well, what do you mean,
"put in the ground"?

10:38.257 --> 10:42.085
Well, she wanted to bury her mother with it. 
That was the most important thing to her.

10:42.085 --> 10:43.820
Maybe you thought you'd 
call Lawrence at work,

10:43.820 --> 10:46.175
shake him up, he'd cough up the ring?

10:46.175 --> 10:48.713
Young lady didn't even know where he worked.

10:48.713 --> 10:51.344
If somebody called him, it wasn't me.

10:55.095 --> 10:58.400
Well, the best thing about 
Sharm-el-Sheik is the wall diving.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.018
Oh, and the fan coral's spectacular.

11:00.018 --> 11:02.641
There's tons of it in Belize.

11:02.844 --> 11:05.323
Have you thought of switching to nitrox.

11:05.323 --> 11:07.296
As a physician, I'd recommend it.

11:07.296 --> 11:09.001
I'll read up on it.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.116
How long have you been diving, Doctor?

11:11.116 --> 11:14.076
I got certified last year.

11:14.213 --> 11:17.100
Will you excuse me?
I need to freshen up.

11:17.100 --> 11:20.170
- Isabel?
- Oh, yes. Excuse us.

11:22.945 --> 11:26.729
Well, it's been three months.
You seem to be getting along well.

11:26.729 --> 11:31.244
Claudia, I'm so glad you introduced us.
He is so smart.

11:31.244 --> 11:36.237
He's so selfless. You should see
how much his patients appreciate him.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.514
All these years,
my wife's been your patient.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.337
Glad we finally had the chance to meet, Doctor.

11:42.337 --> 11:44.807
Claudia's a terrific young woman.

11:45.230 --> 11:47.185
Yeah. I'm a lucky guy.

11:47.185 --> 11:50.534
But you should have seen her when she was 24.

11:54.608 --> 11:56.370
What was Lawrence's 
alibi at the time of the murder?

11:56.370 --> 11:58.945
He was at home...
canoodling with his bride-to-be.

11:58.945 --> 12:01.349
As an alibi, it's not terrific.

12:01.349 --> 12:05.016
Let's go with it for now, and let's 
assume Danielle wasn't behind that call.

12:05.016 --> 12:08.074
Who was? Somebody who wanted to 
throw suspicion on Lawrence?

12:08.074 --> 12:09.659
It worked, far as it went.

12:09.659 --> 12:12.636
Maybe the ring isn't the reason 
why Danielle was killed.

12:12.636 --> 12:15.644
I found this in Mrs. Pearce's personal papers.

12:15.644 --> 12:17.766
It's a receipt from the funeral home...

12:17.766 --> 12:19.483
for a prepaid cremation.

12:19.483 --> 12:21.478
The old gal was planning ahead.

12:21.478 --> 12:22.752
She was on Medicaid.

12:22.752 --> 12:25.723
To qualify, she had to spend down her assets.

12:25.723 --> 12:27.866
That's what my mother had to do.

12:28.262 --> 12:31.352
One way is to prepay funeral expenses.

12:31.352 --> 12:35.879
Now, Danielle told the detective 
her mother was going to be buried.

12:35.879 --> 12:38.276
That's why she needed the ring.

12:38.276 --> 12:41.315
Cremation... she was in the way.

12:41.911 --> 12:44.766
Now, the name of the funeral
home is right on that receipt.

12:44.766 --> 12:48.086
It's the Hemmerick Brothers on Clayton Powell.

12:49.148 --> 12:53.661
My secretary gave me the message that you
wanted to inspect Mrs. Pearce's remains.

12:53.661 --> 12:55.452
They're right over here.

12:55.682 --> 12:58.622
They came from the crematorium just this morning.

13:02.072 --> 13:04.928
Can I ask what you're hopin' to find?

13:04.928 --> 13:07.412
Evidence of another murder.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.225
Here's a copy of Mrs. Pearce's death certificate.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.538
The cause of death was a stroke.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.080
One of the daughters was 
insisting on a burial, is that right?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.976
Was anybody in particular 
pushing for a cremation?

13:23.976 --> 13:28.540
Mrs. Pearce had made her wishes known 
by purchasing the cremation contract.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.581
The doctor who signed the death certificate...

13:31.581 --> 13:33.994
Dr. Lindgard.
Do you know who he is?

13:33.994 --> 13:36.097
I believe he's Mrs. Pearce's doctor.

13:36.097 --> 13:38.323
He was called to her home.

13:38.511 --> 13:41.911
Yeah. Since he determined...
that she died of natural causes,

13:41.911 --> 13:46.668
the M.E. Would've signed off on the cremation...

13:47.033 --> 13:48.884
without an autopsy.

13:48.884 --> 13:51.591
If you want to avoid an autopsy,
don't call 911.

13:51.591 --> 13:53.980
Call the family doctor.

13:54.905 --> 13:57.291
OFFICE OF DR. LINDGARD
MANHATTAN HOSPITAL
361 EAST 66TH STREET
TUESDAY, APRIL 12

13:57.950 --> 14:02.073
I saw her earlier that day.
She complained of fatigue.

14:02.073 --> 14:04.627
I decided to change her medication.

14:04.627 --> 14:06.825
I told her I'd come back and sample her.

14:06.825 --> 14:08.415
"Sample her"...What does that mean?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.036
I brought her drug samples from my office.

14:11.036 --> 14:13.475
So, I called to say I was on my way,

14:13.475 --> 14:16.143
and when she didn't answer,
I got concerned.

14:16.143 --> 14:17.747
I called for an ambulance.

14:17.747 --> 14:19.754
And then you found Mrs. Pearce dead?

14:19.754 --> 14:21.566
Her home care attendant was there.

14:21.566 --> 14:25.285
She'd been knocking on the door 
for 15 minutes or so she said.

14:25.285 --> 14:27.549
The super finally let us in.

14:28.703 --> 14:30.226
You diagnosed a stroke.

14:30.226 --> 14:33.866
How much of an examination did you perform?

14:34.050 --> 14:35.995
I didn't cut her open right 
there on the living room floor.

14:35.995 --> 14:39.764
I relied on 30 years of medical 
practice to make my determination.

14:39.764 --> 14:41.382
Any chance you missed something?

14:41.382 --> 14:44.024
No. It all made sense.

14:44.253 --> 14:47.704
- Because?
- For the obvious reason.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.682
Oh, I'll have a... a guess.

14:52.682 --> 14:54.429
Uh, she had a preexisting condition.

14:54.429 --> 14:56.584
Atrial fibrillation.

14:56.584 --> 14:59.458
Do you want me to explain what that is?

15:01.846 --> 15:05.078
It's an arrythmia.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.384
Isn't it?

15:08.002 --> 15:09.551
And the home care attendant,

15:09.551 --> 15:12.358
you didn't believe her story 
about knocking for 15 minutes.

15:12.358 --> 15:14.900
Who knocks on the door for 15 minutes?

15:14.900 --> 15:17.990
Right. Who does?
You have her name?

15:17.990 --> 15:21.196
Oh, it's probably in Mrs. Pearce's file.

15:23.669 --> 15:27.876
So, Detective, 10 rounds or 15?

15:28.387 --> 15:30.170
Your sidearm.

15:30.170 --> 15:31.577
Ten.

15:32.573 --> 15:33.923
Mm. Fifteen's too heavy.

15:33.923 --> 15:37.584
Hard to maintain proper control of your weapon.

15:37.584 --> 15:39.233
You're a gun enthusiast, Doctor?

15:39.233 --> 15:41.699
I find target shooting very relaxing.

15:41.699 --> 15:45.579
Really? Firing a weapon 
never has that effect on me.

15:45.704 --> 15:48.633
I'm surprised you have 
time for hobbies, Doctor.

15:48.633 --> 15:51.266
You have such a busy 
practice here at the hospital.

15:51.266 --> 15:52.927
And your house calls.

15:52.927 --> 15:55.787
I'll bet not many of your 
colleagues still do house calls.

15:55.787 --> 15:59.040
I devote two days a week to 
visiting my elderly patients.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.479
I'm surprised your office isn't 
wall-to-wall plaques and awards.

16:03.479 --> 16:06.043
That's not what I'm about.

16:06.938 --> 16:09.320
Well, you're a dying breed, Doctor.

16:09.646 --> 16:11.333
Thank you.

16:13.271 --> 16:15.687
Well, of course I knocked for 15 minutes.

16:15.687 --> 16:17.559
Mrs. Pearce was hard of hearing,

16:17.559 --> 16:19.483
and if she was in the bathroom...

16:19.483 --> 16:22.383
And once you entered the apartment,

16:22.585 --> 16:23.990
Dr. Lindgard, what did he do?

16:23.990 --> 16:27.204
Dr. Lindgard checked Mrs. Pearce for a pulse.

16:27.204 --> 16:31.124
I was about to call 911,
but he said, "Don't bother."

16:31.124 --> 16:32.790
Did he call anybody?

16:32.790 --> 16:36.228
He got on the phone with 
Jonas Memorial Hospital.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.615
He kept telling me to wait.

16:38.615 --> 16:39.991
For what?

16:39.991 --> 16:44.564
He told the hospital he was 
canceling an ambulance he ordered.

16:45.866 --> 16:47.698
And that's why he wanted you to wait?

16:47.698 --> 16:49.104
It must have been.

16:49.104 --> 16:53.349
Because then he just sat 
down and started fillin' out forms.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.674
Jonas Memorial has a record of a call...

16:56.674 --> 17:00.019
canceling an ambulance 
run to Mrs. Pearce's address.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.886
But no record of any ambulance 
being ordered in the first place.

17:06.954 --> 17:12.752
Well, the call to cancel was all for show...

17:12.920 --> 17:15.276
to cover the fact that he 
never ordered an ambulance.

17:15.276 --> 17:18.068
Probably because Mrs. Pearce was already 
dead from the first time he saw her,

17:18.068 --> 17:20.400
maybe from malpractice.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.755
A blowhard like him wouldn't 
want to admit he was incompetent.

17:23.755 --> 17:26.839
He might try to cover it up with a cremation.

17:28.655 --> 17:32.307
Mrs. Pearce's Medicaid records 
are consistent with what he told us.

17:32.307 --> 17:36.587
He diagnosed her with 
atrial fibrillation four months ago.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.936
And then, there's the ring.

17:41.936 --> 17:46.982
He stole it.
Probably to distract us from malpractice.

18:07.248 --> 18:09.177
Eames, look at this.

18:09.513 --> 18:12.716
The photograph was printed January 15.

18:12.716 --> 18:17.040
On the 23rd, Lindgard 
diagnosed her with atrial fibrillation.

18:17.836 --> 18:21.617
February 1, she signed 
up for prepaid cremation.

18:21.770 --> 18:24.740
He sees the ring.
He lays the groundwork for a cause of death.

18:24.740 --> 18:27.070
And a means of disposing of the body.

18:27.070 --> 18:29.212
And I thought he was just incompetent.

18:29.212 --> 18:31.739
The certificate was notarized.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.743
Look at the notary's address.

18:35.743 --> 18:38.449
Lindgard's hospital.

18:38.633 --> 18:41.320
ACCOUNTS OFFICE MANHATTAN HOSPITAL
361 EAST 66TH STREET
TUESDAY, APRIL 13

18:41.320 --> 18:45.085
Oh, yes. That's me. 
I notarize all sorts of documents.

18:45.085 --> 18:49.047
Thanks to my notary's license,
I meet so many nice people.

18:49.047 --> 18:51.068
Including Mrs. Pearce?

18:51.068 --> 18:53.410
Dr. Lindgard bring her in?

18:54.029 --> 18:57.460
Do you keep a notary book?
Can we see her entry?

18:59.855 --> 19:03.367
February 1, here she is.

19:05.697 --> 19:10.355
Oh, uh, is that her thumbprint there?

19:12.554 --> 19:14.158
Yes.

19:14.158 --> 19:18.753
Oh, it doesn't have a scar.
Mrs. Pearce had a scar on her thumb.

19:18.886 --> 19:21.296
This, uh, thumbprint has no scar.

19:21.296 --> 19:23.034
Oh, darn.

19:24.117 --> 19:28.559
Dr. Lindgard told me she was too 
sick to come to the hospital herself.

19:28.559 --> 19:31.310
It-It-It's never been a problem before.

19:31.310 --> 19:33.014
Before?

19:33.134 --> 19:37.321
You've notarized other cremation 
certificates for Dr. Lindgard?

19:38.417 --> 19:40.351
How many?

19:41.008 --> 19:45.643
Well, I've been here eight years, so...

19:50.478 --> 19:52.674
Claudia said she had fun the other night.

19:52.674 --> 19:54.976
Yeah?
Well, her husband's a shrimp.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.565
Oh, Edwin.
Don't be mean.

19:57.565 --> 19:59.413
Hope we don't have to wait too long for a cab.

19:59.413 --> 20:01.122
Thought we could walk.

20:01.122 --> 20:03.167
To Lincoln Center?
I'm wearing heels.

20:03.167 --> 20:04.532
So, we'll take the subway.

20:04.532 --> 20:07.919
Edwin, you have to spend a little to get a little.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.863
Well, now that you mention it.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.527
I have something for you.

20:16.443 --> 20:19.873
Oh, my!
Edwin, that's beautiful.

20:19.873 --> 20:23.159
All those emeralds and rubies! Ooh!

20:30.637 --> 20:32.799
Oh, nobody's ever given me anything like this.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.753
I designed that setting myself.

20:36.897 --> 20:38.618
Thank you.

20:41.589 --> 20:42.734
Isabel?

20:43.595 --> 20:46.233
Let's stay in tonight.

20:46.702 --> 20:50.321
I guarantee you a night to remember.

20:50.321 --> 20:54.383
I explained to you, Edwin.
L... I'm just not ready to go that far.

20:54.638 --> 20:56.913
Not yet.  /  All right.

20:57.001 --> 20:59.073
No intercourse.

20:59.073 --> 21:02.903
Maybe just some oral pleasure.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.832
Let's just go to the concert.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.959
Please?

21:15.263 --> 21:20.191
All in, we found 673 prepaid cremations 
bought over the last 25 years...

21:20.191 --> 21:22.416
by Lindgard's patients with his help.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.469
Of those, a third are still alive,

21:24.469 --> 21:27.131
a third died in accidents or in hospitals...

21:27.131 --> 21:29.352
Then, there's the other third.

21:29.684 --> 21:31.887
All of them died at home.

21:32.023 --> 21:35.416
All of them had their death 
certificates signed by Lindgard.

21:35.982 --> 21:37.933
How many exactly?

21:39.373 --> 21:41.501
Two hundred and forty-eight.

21:42.365 --> 21:43.749
Has the M.E. Looked at this yet?

21:43.749 --> 21:45.394
No.
But with all the victims cremated,

21:45.394 --> 21:48.022
it'll be tough making the true cause of death.

21:48.022 --> 21:51.434
And ifhe has the same M.O. He always has,

21:51.434 --> 21:55.918
he'll make sure there's 
always a witness to testify...

21:55.918 --> 21:59.500
that he checked the body for a pulse,
did all the things a good doctor does...

21:59.500 --> 22:02.659
He killed 248 people...

22:02.858 --> 22:05.775
just to pilfer their jewelry boxes?

22:06.083 --> 22:10.599
Or... he kills because he can.

22:13.486 --> 22:16.280
All the deaths were listed as strokes,

22:16.280 --> 22:19.030
and all the victims had been 
diagnosed with heart conditions.

22:19.030 --> 22:21.563
All diagnosed by Lindgard.

22:21.726 --> 22:25.867
This guy was Johnny-on-the-spot,
finding bodies, signing death certificates.

22:25.867 --> 22:27.631
Why didn't he set off alarm bells?

22:27.631 --> 22:30.169
Well, if he'd signed more than...
four certificates a month,

22:30.169 --> 22:32.202
our computer would've flagged him.

22:32.202 --> 22:35.611
But ten, 12 a year,
with credible diagnoses?

22:35.773 --> 22:38.987
Well, you wouldn't wanna leave 
any visible signs of violence.

22:39.262 --> 22:42.372
The method of death was probably a poison,

22:42.797 --> 22:44.003
maybe an opiate.

22:44.003 --> 22:47.833
he's a doctor in a hospital. He's got an 
embarrassment of riches to choose from.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.587
Any way to trip this guy up?

22:49.587 --> 22:52.228
What about the Medicaid billings?
Any inconsistencies?

22:52.228 --> 22:57.019
Well, one treatment for 
heart disease is drug therapy.

22:57.019 --> 23:00.539
But there's no record these 
people ever filled a prescription.

23:01.146 --> 23:04.476
That's in case anyone challenged his findings.

23:05.435 --> 23:09.573
He would have to document his 
victims' deteriorating heart disease.

23:09.573 --> 23:12.567
He'd have to doctor his patients' records.

23:13.702 --> 23:16.261
Dr. Lindgard wants you to wait until he gets back.

23:16.261 --> 23:17.861
He's a funny doctor.

23:17.861 --> 23:20.981
Is there anything you need to 
save off the computer before we,

23:20.981 --> 23:23.265
you know, yank the plug?

23:29.622 --> 23:33.456
What's that? Hmm?
What, dinner invitations?

23:33.456 --> 23:38.764
A drug company asked Dr. Lindgard to 
host a dinner for the hospital's chiefs of staff.

23:38.764 --> 23:42.924
Dr. Lindgard is very highly regarded.

23:43.052 --> 23:44.736
Does he ever work on your computer?

23:44.736 --> 23:47.456
Dr. Lindgard knows more 
about computers than I do.

23:47.456 --> 23:51.356
One day he just sat down 
and mastered the entire system.

23:51.356 --> 23:53.484
One day? What inspired him to do that?

23:53.484 --> 23:56.568
Our whole system crashed four years ago.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.526
We lost all the patients' records.

23:58.526 --> 24:01.779
I had to reenter all the data by hand.

24:01.779 --> 24:04.013
Four years ago.

24:04.532 --> 24:06.019
Do you remember the month?

24:06.019 --> 24:07.994
Oh, July.

24:14.442 --> 24:18.450
Um, mid-July, after the 12th?

24:20.267 --> 24:22.747
APARTMENT OF ALFRED & VALERIE PERRET
QUEENS, NEW YORK
THURSDAY, APRIL 15

24:22.747 --> 24:25.225
I called my mom to see how she 
was gettin'along with the heat,

24:25.225 --> 24:26.582
and she said she was fine.

24:26.582 --> 24:28.314
And then later, 
we got a call to come over.

24:28.314 --> 24:31.108
Dr. Lindgard was there.
He told us her heart gave out.

24:31.108 --> 24:33.750
You had a problem with Dr. Lindgard's diagnosis?

24:33.750 --> 24:35.448
No. With his attitude.

24:35.448 --> 24:38.279
He never actually came out
and said she was dead.

24:38.279 --> 24:41.414
He was, uh, playing a little game.
He made you guess.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.739
Yeah, that's right.
He said something was wrong with my mother,

24:43.739 --> 24:45.603
and then I said, "Shall we call 911?"

24:45.603 --> 24:47.366
And then he said,
"No, it's not necessary."

24:47.366 --> 24:50.707
- I asked him why, and he said...
- He said, "For the obvious reasons."

24:50.707 --> 24:52.220
Yes.

24:55.053 --> 24:59.858
I see that your mother is wearing a Star of
David around her neck. She was religious?

24:59.858 --> 25:01.778
Yes.

25:02.147 --> 25:04.953
- She would've wanted a burial.
- Oh, of course.

25:04.953 --> 25:07.889
Our records show she prepaid for a cremation.

25:07.889 --> 25:10.274
Did this cause problems with Dr. Lindgard?

25:10.274 --> 25:12.058
He wanted us to go ahead with the cremation,

25:12.058 --> 25:14.044
but I wouldn't let Alfred do it.

25:14.044 --> 25:17.396
His mother got her religious burial.

25:17.396 --> 25:22.753
- Al, you wanna help me with this.
- Sure. Excuse me.

25:23.742 --> 25:28.185
So, Dr. Lindgard was worried 
that if the body was ever exhumed,

25:28.185 --> 25:29.982
the autopsy would show that the cause of death...

25:29.982 --> 25:32.318
was inconsistent with what he had in her file.

25:32.318 --> 25:34.130
He had to delete her file,

25:34.130 --> 25:37.281
so he crashed his computer to cover it up.

25:37.281 --> 25:38.279
There's still the body.

25:38.279 --> 25:39.668
Which, according toJewish tradition,

25:39.668 --> 25:42.629
would've been buried without
embalming in a plain box.

25:42.629 --> 25:47.085
Odds are there's not enough 
of it left for a tox exam.

25:48.311 --> 25:51.495
You think Lindgard knows the odds?

25:53.333 --> 25:57.626
Hiya, Doc. You goin'to the office or is
this one of your Marcus Welby days?

25:57.626 --> 26:00.069
I'd prefer if you call me "doctor," 
and if you want to talk to me,

26:00.069 --> 26:01.712
call my office for an appointment.

26:01.712 --> 26:05.353
We just have a couple of questions about
the patient records we took the other day.

26:05.353 --> 26:09.024
So does my attorney.
He'd like to know when I can have them back.

26:10.204 --> 26:15.112
You don't like garages?
Not at 600 a month.

26:15.112 --> 26:16.615
So, what are your questions?

26:16.615 --> 26:19.159
We noticed the patients whose 
death certificates you signed

26:19.159 --> 26:21.791
never billed Medicaid for prescriptions.

26:21.791 --> 26:24.605
That's because I sampled them,
just like Mrs. Pearce.

26:24.605 --> 26:28.323
And where my elderly patients live,
there aren't many pharmacies or they don't deliver.

26:28.323 --> 26:31.031
Anyway, at that age,
it's all about care not cure...

26:31.031 --> 26:34.519
making sure they eat well,
getting the right vitamins.

26:34.654 --> 26:36.703
That's how you get results.

26:39.039 --> 26:42.677
Prepaid cremations, is that another 
part of the Lindgard treatment?

26:42.677 --> 26:45.775
It's all done with the patient's consent.

26:45.955 --> 26:47.787
What's that?

26:48.220 --> 26:53.080
The Hudson Valley Bed and Breakfast Guide.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.082
Are you goin' on a weekend getaway?

26:55.082 --> 26:56.487
Not alone, we hope.

26:56.487 --> 26:58.202
She the one that gave you that tie?

26:58.202 --> 27:00.950
What makes you think anybody bought my tie?

27:01.418 --> 27:05.355
It's silk, right? Hermes?
It's probably worth about $200.

27:05.355 --> 27:09.648
You won't even pay for a 
parking garage for your car.

27:14.147 --> 27:17.456
But you paid to have the car cleaned recently.

27:17.456 --> 27:20.093
Someone have an accident in here,
maybe got sick?

27:20.093 --> 27:21.543
No.

27:21.543 --> 27:24.737
I have my car cleaned once a week.

27:26.438 --> 27:29.590
Look, is there anything else?

27:31.139 --> 27:33.264
Just one more thing.

27:33.264 --> 27:37.863
We noticed, uh, one of your patient's 
files missing from your computer.

27:38.101 --> 27:41.204
Mrs. Ruth Perret,
she died four years ago.

27:41.204 --> 27:43.221
Oh, I lost all my files four years ago.

27:43.221 --> 27:46.545
Didn't my assistant tell you,
computer meltdown?

27:46.545 --> 27:51.274
We exhumed the body last night.
The M.E. Is doing an autopsy today.

27:51.274 --> 27:53.697
As I remember,
Ruth Perret was Jewish.

27:53.697 --> 27:55.274
There was no embalming.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.156
Did you know they use a plain pine box...

27:57.156 --> 28:00.923
with holes drilled in the bottom to 
accelerate the decomposition?

28:00.923 --> 28:05.178
And after four years in the cold, 
wet soil of the cemetery in Queens,

28:05.178 --> 28:08.245
I can't imagine there'd be anything 
more than bones to work with,

28:08.245 --> 28:11.791
hardly enough to determine the cause of death.

28:18.066 --> 28:19.393
He called our bluff.

28:19.393 --> 28:22.578
We might as well have invited him to the exhumation.

28:22.922 --> 28:25.475
Maybe there's one base he hasn't covered.

28:26.451 --> 28:31.306
Well, Friday night, Dr. Lindgard and 
I saw a Moroccan film at Alice Tully Hall.

28:31.516 --> 28:34.516
- Then he walked me home.
- What time did he leave here?

28:34.516 --> 28:36.615
Gosh, it was late.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.719
God, I don't remember the time.

28:39.350 --> 28:44.338
Is that the kind of man Dr. Lindgard is,
he makes a woman forget the time?

28:44.926 --> 28:48.546
Well, it's obvious how much you like him.
That was a beautiful tie that you bought him.

28:48.546 --> 28:50.087
For our three-month anniversary.

28:50.087 --> 28:51.684
What did he get you,
somethin' nice?

28:51.684 --> 28:54.198
Jewelry?
Maybe a ring?

28:54.935 --> 28:56.256
I don't think I have to tell you that.

28:56.256 --> 28:58.116
Is that because he went the cheap route?

28:58.116 --> 29:00.883
Makes you walk home,
doesn't pay for a cab.

29:00.883 --> 29:03.190
He's careful.
He has to be.

29:03.190 --> 29:05.637
He still has obligations to his ex-wife.

29:05.637 --> 29:08.802
He's not one of those millionaire 
doctors with rich patients.

29:08.802 --> 29:10.103
He works with poor people.

29:10.103 --> 29:13.187
Ms. Dawson, we understand 
your feelings for Dr. Lindgard.

29:13.187 --> 29:14.981
But he's not what he seems.

29:14.981 --> 29:19.089
No, he's kind.
He's completely in tune with me.

29:19.089 --> 29:21.986
I don't have to explain myself to him.

29:21.986 --> 29:23.958
Explain yourself?

29:24.617 --> 29:28.064
You mean,
that you're a recovering alcoholic?

29:29.096 --> 29:31.169
Twelve-stepper's Prayer.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.398
Dr. Lindgard, is he also A.A.?

29:33.398 --> 29:35.854
He doesn't have a problem with alcohol.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.167
Somethin' else?

29:37.167 --> 29:39.559
I'm sorry.
I'm not getting into this.

29:39.559 --> 29:42.147
Now, please leave us alone.

29:46.358 --> 29:49.286
His girlfriend alluded to him having 
a substance abuse problem.

29:49.286 --> 29:51.197
The only thing we found dates from 30 years ago

29:51.197 --> 29:53.605
when he was working 
at a clinic up in Hopewell.

29:53.605 --> 29:55.382
He put a car in a ditch?

29:55.382 --> 29:57.126
They do a Breathalyzer or blood test?

29:57.126 --> 29:59.041
Just a Breathalyzer. He passed.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.960
But the following week, 
he resigned from the clinic.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.178
Thank you.

30:03.966 --> 30:06.984
Pethidine.
It's a synthetic opioid.

30:06.984 --> 30:09.764
The clinic in Hopewell said that 
Lindgard was overprescribing it...

30:09.764 --> 30:11.622
To patients who weren't receiving it.

30:11.622 --> 30:13.629
Let me guess.
He was putting it up his veins.

30:13.629 --> 30:15.874
That's what they suspected,
but they couldn't prove it.

30:15.874 --> 30:19.775
Call just came in to 911.
Possible D.O.A. On 137 th.

30:19.775 --> 30:23.360
The address matches one of Lindgard's patients.

30:24.071 --> 30:26.254
- Where's the patient?
- In the kitchen. She's fine.

30:26.254 --> 30:28.070
We got the call she was D.O.A.

30:28.070 --> 30:29.554
Yeah, that's how it came in.

30:29.554 --> 30:32.623
Lucky for her her doctor was in 
the building visiting another patient.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.785
The guy saved her life.

30:38.744 --> 30:42.586
Well, look who's here.
Eames and Goren. Detectives.

30:42.586 --> 30:45.175
They probably thought you
needed protection from me.

30:45.175 --> 30:47.759
- Why, that's silly.
- Oh, of course, dear.

30:47.759 --> 30:52.603
Just an irregular heartbeat,
nothing more serious than that.

30:54.903 --> 30:57.617
Smug bastard got us.

30:57.617 --> 30:59.773
This is better than pethidine.

30:59.773 --> 31:02.333
He's addicted to power now...

31:02.487 --> 31:04.604
over life and death.

31:08.046 --> 31:12.523
My office has received calls 
from a dozen community leaders...

31:12.523 --> 31:17.071
and public health advocates who
think Lindgard is being unfairly targeted.

31:17.071 --> 31:21.595
Of course, if I could show them 
why their faith in him is... misplaced.

31:21.595 --> 31:24.798
He got rid of any evidence.
He tampered with his computer records.

31:24.798 --> 31:27.007
What about the method of death?

31:28.385 --> 31:32.062
Uh, he used, uh, pethidine on himself.
He's familiar with narcotics.

31:32.062 --> 31:33.822
It's probably the weapon of his choice.

31:33.822 --> 31:36.805
Where's he getting it...
the hospital dispensary?

31:37.474 --> 31:39.544
There's no evidence of that.

31:40.515 --> 31:45.123
Well, then, until you do have evidence,
stay away from Dr. Lindgard.

31:49.719 --> 31:51.419
You're not letting up on this guy.

31:51.419 --> 31:53.242
This is, uh, Lindgard's divorce decree.

31:53.242 --> 31:57.437
He's been paying alimony
to his ex-wife for 25 years.

31:57.598 --> 32:03.066
But he hasn't, uh, claimed the 
alimony as a deduction on his taxes.

32:03.066 --> 32:05.969
Which means she doesn't 
have to pay taxes on it.

32:06.365 --> 32:08.237
Heck of a nice gift.

32:08.237 --> 32:09.597
What did she do to deserve that?

32:09.597 --> 32:12.579
Uh, the fact that, uh,

32:12.931 --> 32:17.209
she's a pharmacist might 
have something to do with it.

32:19.314 --> 32:21.692
C&B PHARMACY
WHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21

32:21.692 --> 32:24.072
The subpoena's a final boarding call, Ms. Cruthers.

32:24.072 --> 32:28.458
Once we start our search,
anybody not on the train'll be left behind.

32:28.458 --> 32:31.664
You were supplying your husband drugs...

32:32.095 --> 32:35.793
in return for a tax break on your alimony.

32:37.444 --> 32:39.650
Oh, God!

32:40.365 --> 32:42.154
How long have you been supplying him?

32:42.154 --> 32:43.516
Twenty years.

32:43.516 --> 32:46.383
Once a month,
just enough for his personal use.

32:46.383 --> 32:50.617
"His personal use." 
He told you that he was an addict?

32:50.617 --> 32:53.275
And admit something's stronger than him?

32:53.275 --> 32:56.270
The great man's incapable of that.

32:56.410 --> 32:58.217
He was shooting up pethidine 30 years ago.

32:58.217 --> 33:00.506
It nearly cost him his life.

33:00.506 --> 33:03.543
Not that he'd admit any of it's his fault.

33:03.543 --> 33:04.375
He blames you?

33:04.375 --> 33:08.574
Me, his dead mother,
even her visiting nurse.

33:09.559 --> 33:11.317
Oh, what did she do to him?

33:11.317 --> 33:14.697
When Edwin was a teenager,
his mother died of cancer at home.

33:14.697 --> 33:17.282
He said the nurse came and 
gave her morphine every day...

33:17.282 --> 33:20.634
and taught him to use a syringe.

33:22.159 --> 33:25.269
I was about to give his mother 
an injection one day,

33:25.269 --> 33:28.572
and Eddie asked me if I'd let him do it.

33:28.572 --> 33:34.271
He was 16, and he really needed to 
feel that he was helping his mother.

33:34.271 --> 33:36.893
- So, I showed him how.
- Her pain was severe.

33:36.893 --> 33:42.896
Oh, yes.
Bone marrow cancer. In 1959,

33:42.896 --> 33:45.629
they just sent her home to die.

33:45.629 --> 33:50.008
I came by in the morning,
before Eddie went off to school.

33:50.159 --> 33:54.661
He would've been up all night,
watching her in her agony.

33:54.661 --> 33:57.256
He hadn't slept.
He was afraid.

33:57.256 --> 33:58.760
Oh, I'll bet he was happy to see you.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.266
Oh, yes. He was.

34:00.266 --> 34:04.587
Once, I had given her the injection,
and-and she quieted down,

34:04.587 --> 34:08.841
he was able to get a little sleep 
before he went off to school.

34:08.841 --> 34:12.623
Was Mrs. Lindgard aware of 
what her son did for her?

34:12.623 --> 34:16.275
Oh, yes. That boy walked with the angels...

34:16.275 --> 34:18.922
as far as she was concerned.

34:19.065 --> 34:21.465
She had high hopes for him.

34:21.465 --> 34:23.522
Thank you, Mrs. Morse.

34:27.167 --> 34:29.043
I can't imagine...
16 years old,

34:29.043 --> 34:32.920
watching his mother suffer
through the night for eight months.

34:33.190 --> 34:35.942
And then find relief in the morning.

34:35.942 --> 34:39.239
It's a scene that he can't stop reliving.

34:39.532 --> 34:41.625
His experience was about being powerless.

34:41.625 --> 34:44.094
He had no control over his mother's suffering,
over life and death.

34:44.094 --> 34:46.440
Now he does,
thanks to a loaded hypodermic needle.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.409
All we can do at this point is take
the needle out of his hands.

34:49.409 --> 34:53.089
His ex-wife's testimony is only 
sufficient to yank his medical license.

34:53.089 --> 34:57.150
So then he goes into rehab and pops
up somewhere else with a new license?

34:57.150 --> 34:59.115
No, if we wanna get him,

34:59.525 --> 35:04.125
his loss of power has to be complete... and public.

35:05.754 --> 35:08.882
We need to find a dinner invitation.

35:10.197 --> 35:12.050
Edwin?

35:13.712 --> 35:16.902
Go inside, Isabel.
I'll be right with you.

35:19.864 --> 35:21.273
Meryl,
what are you doing here?

35:21.273 --> 35:23.190
Your office told me where you'd be.

35:23.190 --> 35:27.514
The police came to the pharmacy 
to talk to me about you.

35:27.514 --> 35:28.629
What did you tell them?

35:28.629 --> 35:29.773
Nothing.

35:29.773 --> 35:32.371
But I had this at home to send to you.

35:32.371 --> 35:35.181
I don't want it around anymore.

35:35.181 --> 35:39.089
- I don't feel safe.
- You're giving this to me here?

35:39.973 --> 35:43.069
This is very inconvenient.

35:43.201 --> 35:45.384
Good-bye, Edwin.

35:49.182 --> 35:53.128
I want to take this opportunity to 
acknowledge our host tonight,

35:53.128 --> 35:56.784
even though Appian Pharmaceutical 
is picking up the tab.

35:58.389 --> 36:03.052
Uh, sorry to barge in.
We're here for Dr. Lindgard.

36:03.052 --> 36:05.118
Uh, Doctor.

36:05.896 --> 36:09.106
- We wanna see you outside.
- You're ordering me?

36:09.106 --> 36:13.692
I'll-I'll talk to you when we 
have finished with our meal.

36:13.692 --> 36:15.733
All right, then, we'll do it here.

36:15.733 --> 36:18.202
Please stand up and empty your pockets.

36:18.202 --> 36:19.823
You've got no right to search me!

36:19.823 --> 36:21.779
You'd be surprised.

36:22.058 --> 36:23.779
What's that supposed to mean?

36:23.779 --> 36:25.740
Well, you like guessing games.

36:25.740 --> 36:26.828
Try guessin'.

36:26.828 --> 36:30.056
Okay, I'm calling my lawyer.

36:31.851 --> 36:37.413
What? Oh. Thanks.
Well, that's not gonna do you any good.

36:37.669 --> 36:41.049
- And why is that?
- The obvious reason.

36:41.049 --> 36:43.025
Probable cause, Doc.

36:43.025 --> 36:45.181
We arrested your ex-wife 20 minutes ago.

36:45.181 --> 36:48.059
She told us she gave you something.

36:52.074 --> 36:54.068
Could we continue this outside?

36:54.068 --> 36:57.789
Too late for that.
Your pockets?

37:04.052 --> 37:07.040
This is what she gave me.

37:16.351 --> 37:18.862
- Oh, that's morphine.
- What? What?

37:19.317 --> 37:21.382
She said she's been feeding 
your habit for 20 years.

37:21.382 --> 37:22.650
I don't have a habit.

37:22.650 --> 37:24.732
You got hooked on pethidine 
straight out of med school.

37:24.732 --> 37:25.355
You have no proof of that.

37:25.355 --> 37:27.388
- You kicked that habit and moved on to morphine.
- That's slander.

37:27.388 --> 37:30.313
Damn it!
I'm not a junkie!

37:30.313 --> 37:35.866
Ask anyone here.
Ask Isabel. She knows me.

37:35.866 --> 37:39.379
Oh, Edwin's nothing like a drug addict.
I mean, I would know...

37:39.379 --> 37:42.672
if he was.  /  Actually,
if one can maintain their supply,

37:42.672 --> 37:48.386
then a morphine habit is very easy to hide.
That's a lovely brooch,

37:48.386 --> 37:51.955
all those rubies and emeralds.

37:51.955 --> 37:53.987
But you say that you're not an addict.

37:53.987 --> 37:57.087
Then what are you gonna do with all 
this morphine? Where's it goin'?

37:57.087 --> 38:01.305
To my patients.
I have elderly patients,

38:01.305 --> 38:03.897
many of whom are longtime heroin addicts.

38:03.897 --> 38:07.022
Quitting is out of the question.
The withdrawal alone would kill them.

38:07.022 --> 38:09.819
So rather than see them 
spend their last dime on drugs,

38:09.819 --> 38:12.800
I decide to give them maintenance doses.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.266
You decide to keep them hooked.

38:14.266 --> 38:16.968
Call it unethical,
but it relieves their suffering.

38:16.968 --> 38:20.656
Like the visiting nurse who relieved your mother.

38:21.696 --> 38:25.815
That's where you get your... altruistic zeal...

38:25.815 --> 38:28.029
from watching her.

38:28.870 --> 38:31.501
You think you know me well.

38:31.973 --> 38:38.490
Yes. That's where I learned...what a 
godsend drugs are to a suffering patient.

38:38.629 --> 38:44.975
You know, we have his...
patient list right here.

38:44.975 --> 38:47.451
Why don't you tell us which of your patients...

38:47.451 --> 38:51.676
get this, uh, godsent... morphine.

38:51.676 --> 38:55.804
You are entering an area of 
doctor-patient confidentiality.

38:55.804 --> 38:58.368
Handing out narcotics without 
a prescription isn't covered.

38:58.368 --> 39:01.160
Ask your colleagues.

39:04.190 --> 39:06.766
You know, the fact that you 
thought you could hide...

39:06.766 --> 39:11.283
evidence of your own addiction...
when it's right there in the quality of your work...

39:11.283 --> 39:13.189
There's nothing wrong with my work.

39:13.189 --> 39:17.274
Your heart patients keeling over 
six months after you diagnosed them.

39:17.274 --> 39:21.892
- That's not unusual.
- No, really, so many... 248.

39:21.892 --> 39:25.085
They were probably sick for years.
You werejust too stoned to catch it.

39:25.085 --> 39:28.479
I told you those drugs were for my patients.

39:28.479 --> 39:30.790
- Drug addicts...
- That's what their medical records will say.

39:30.790 --> 39:35.185
If we have a look, it's gonna 
say that they're drug addicts?

39:35.185 --> 39:38.071
It's back to you, Doc,
you and your drug habit.

39:38.071 --> 39:43.544
You know, you fit the profile of a... workin'junkie.

39:43.544 --> 39:48.349
Negligent, incompetent...
even steals from his patients.

39:49.629 --> 39:51.696
You know,
I can't get over that brooch.

39:51.696 --> 39:56.098
That was the anniversary gift that
Dr. Lindgard gave you, isn't it?

39:56.098 --> 39:59.554
- Do you know where he bought it?
- He had it made.

39:59.691 --> 40:01.838
You said you designed the setting yourself.

40:01.838 --> 40:06.631
Wow. Healer, gun enthusiast,
jewelry designer...

40:06.631 --> 40:10.857
There is nothin' that Dr. Lindgard can't do.

40:11.179 --> 40:15.607
Would you like to see where
he got the stones for that brooch?

40:21.828 --> 40:25.798
This ring... four rubies,

40:26.426 --> 40:30.096
four emeralds...
just like your brooch.

40:30.768 --> 40:35.885
Now he stole this ring from a 
woman whose wake you attended.

40:35.885 --> 40:38.924
The woman whose daughter was
killed a day after she complained...

40:38.924 --> 40:41.383
about her mother's missing ring.

40:41.383 --> 40:44.002
- Isabel, don't...
- You stole her ring.

40:45.470 --> 40:48.274
Then you strutted around her parlor...

40:48.274 --> 40:52.779
to show me how much her family admired you.

40:57.403 --> 41:00.141
You feel it slippin'away from you, Doc?

41:00.141 --> 41:03.777
Feel yourself, you know, losin' control?

41:04.413 --> 41:08.510
The ground shiftin' under you?

41:09.681 --> 41:13.904
It's familiar, isn't it,
that panic growin' in your gut?

41:14.040 --> 41:15.897
It's the same panic that you...

41:15.897 --> 41:19.519
you felt in the early hours of dawn...

41:19.765 --> 41:22.605
when your mother's pain was at its worst.

41:25.075 --> 41:29.578
Her body shuddering with spasms,
and you couldn't stop it.

41:29.578 --> 41:31.955
Her fair-haired boy...

41:32.219 --> 41:35.566
she had all her hopes pinned on you.

41:36.378 --> 41:39.111
You couldn't control her disease.

41:39.741 --> 41:43.631
You couldn't spare her one moment of agony.

41:44.572 --> 41:47.288
Well, you're still that powerless boy.

41:47.288 --> 41:50.218
Your life is controlled by morphine.

41:50.802 --> 41:53.795
You can't even read a pulse.

41:54.732 --> 41:58.705
You're just a fumbling, preening...

41:58.705 --> 42:00.707
- god of medicine.
- That's not true!

42:00.707 --> 42:02.763
Oh, come on.!
Your patients dying...

42:02.763 --> 42:05.107
because of your carelessness,

42:05.107 --> 42:08.183
and you just stand there,
mystified by it all.

42:08.183 --> 42:11.072
You're a victim of your own addiction.

42:12.326 --> 42:14.315
Impotent fool...

42:15.130 --> 42:19.890
people dyin' all around you,
no reason why or when...

42:19.890 --> 42:21.971
- I decide when!
- It's not up to you!

42:21.971 --> 42:24.897
I'm in control!

42:25.252 --> 42:29.142
I take their lives!
I give them their deaths!

42:29.496 --> 42:34.836
I decide. I choose when.

42:34.979 --> 42:38.246
That's what the morphine's for.!

42:49.597 --> 42:53.470
- You don't get off that easily.
- You're under arrest, Doc.

43:11.729 --> 43:15.429
He won't be walkin' with the angels anytime soon.
