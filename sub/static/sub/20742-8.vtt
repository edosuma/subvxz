00:00.790 --> 00:02.469
Previously on The Bridge...

00:02.469 --> 00:04.570
You like details, huh?

00:04.689 --> 00:06.140
Just like the killer.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.530
It's how I work.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.640
How's things at home?

00:09.650 --> 00:10.790
It is what it is.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.210
We don't have to do this.

00:14.050 --> 00:17.520
Well... it's what we both want, right?

00:18.740 --> 00:20.180
I want to get something going down here.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.620
You know what I mean?

00:21.770 --> 00:23.500
- I do. - Think you could

00:23.500 --> 00:24.860
set me up with 15 to start?

00:24.860 --> 00:27.530
- Just gonna take me a couple of days. - Sweet.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.460
Good job, Timmy. Snitching suits you.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.050
But I have a partial match on a car

00:33.050 --> 00:34.580
that was sold at a auction

00:34.580 --> 00:36.860
in Las Cruces five years ago.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.840
Is there a name?

00:38.840 --> 00:42.070
Jack Childress, lives out on McNutt Road.

00:43.330 --> 00:46.470
El Paso PD. Open the door!

00:48.770 --> 00:50.250
He's been to Mexico.

00:50.970 --> 00:52.990
Many times he calls them his "missions."

00:52.990 --> 00:54.420
I will shoot you.

00:55.510 --> 00:57.030
I believe you will.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.430
You could've run.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.960
Why'd you stay to shoot? 

01:06.650 --> 01:08.450
My job wasn't done.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.540
I meant to kill the Mexican.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

01:30.220 --> 01:32.250
God, that feels so good.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.180
I can't... I can't... I can't feel my dick.

01:40.710 --> 01:41.970
Guess what?

01:47.880 --> 01:50.970
It is a little... it's a little cold in the nether regions.

01:50.970 --> 01:52.980
Daddy!

01:53.190 --> 01:54.560
Give me your pants.

01:55.670 --> 01:57.480
Oh, shit!

01:57.480 --> 01:59.780
For real? I want those pants.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.260
Give me the pants!

02:05.290 --> 02:06.500
Yes! Yes!

02:13.350 --> 02:14.320
You're rich.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.630
Rich guys aren't supposed to run--

02:15.630 --> 02:17.770
oh, shit-- aren't supposed to run out of drugs ever.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.110
It's the great equalizer, isn't it, dude?

02:19.110 --> 02:20.040
Ooh, it's a buzzkill.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.060
Eh, we'll be across and back in 20 minutes.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.370
Oh, no. My passport.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.870
It's in my other pantalones.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.710
Go, go with Claudia hot tits.

02:28.710 --> 02:29.690
I'll be back with the blow.

02:29.690 --> 02:32.050
Oh, yes. Come here. Oh, my pants.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.770
Santi! I salute you.

02:39.590 --> 02:41.910
Bye-bye, eh? Yes!

02:43.040 --> 02:44.330
Ooh, yes. Go get 'em.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.340
Yes! Oh, yes!

02:50.640 --> 02:52.300
Andale!

03:50.770 --> 03:53.960
33 illegal weapon found at your place, Jack.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.970
You prepping for the end times?

03:56.800 --> 04:00.650
Dialectics is my answer.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.260
Dialectics is your answer.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.490
We got a laundry list of charges against you,

04:04.490 --> 04:07.370
cop-killing among them, and that doesn't end well.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.320
In your system? No.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.700
We also have a lot of bodies to talk about.

04:13.180 --> 04:16.320
Lorraine Gates. Cristina Fuentes.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.910
Gina Meadows.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.140
I don't know them.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.320
We found a bone saw in your truck.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.770
We're testing it for DNA.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.830
Well, test away, 'cause,

04:25.690 --> 04:27.270
it's not my saw.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.280
Someone put them there?

04:30.350 --> 04:32.150
Well, yeah.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.640
You guys invaded my land.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.250
Strangers all over my property.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.470
Who knows what you left there or took?

04:40.130 --> 04:42.850
Yeah, I've been stolen from before.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.730
What about the car at Peter Meadows' house,

04:44.730 --> 04:45.880
where he was killed?

04:46.380 --> 04:47.620
Also stolen!

04:47.620 --> 04:48.780
But you didn't report it.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.480
Who would I report it to? You?

04:52.740 --> 04:55.010
Why did you want to shoot Marco Ruiz?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.670
The Mexican?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.500
Yes.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.440
Equilibrium.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.930
But you had your chance in the warehouse.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.300
Why just kick him?

05:09.550 --> 05:12.410
Yeah, my brain, it, uh...

05:13.610 --> 05:15.340
it needs a rest.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.200
Why not shoot him then?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.440
I don't know.

05:57.060 --> 05:58.160
Where are the little ones?

06:04.630 --> 06:05.890
It's Alma's.

06:05.910 --> 06:07.410
She's going to a party.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.380
So, I heard you catched the killer.

06:10.410 --> 06:11.590
Oh, yeah.

06:12.270 --> 06:13.620
Yes, yes, yes.

06:16.390 --> 06:17.410
That is cool.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.190
I mean, your marriage is falling apart but congrats.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.690
Everything's gonna be fine, Gus.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.320
This is how it started with my mom.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.150
You stopped coming home.

06:28.860 --> 06:31.340
And after the divorce, I barely saw you.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.030
I...

06:33.190 --> 06:36.510
was working I-I...

06:50.280 --> 06:52.150
You remember the red bike you gave me?

06:52.860 --> 06:54.480
The one that got run over by a van?

06:54.960 --> 06:58.630
Yeah. For your tenth birthday.

06:58.970 --> 07:00.940
I left it in the street on purpose.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.590
Do you have any idea

07:04.590 --> 07:07.520
how many kids would kill for a bike like that?

07:09.180 --> 07:10.910
But I didn't want a bike.

07:21.220 --> 07:22.710
Maybe...

07:23.320 --> 07:26.110
I wasn't there for you enough.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.520
Maybe.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.720
You will understand when you have kids.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.320
It's not easy.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.970
Yeah, you sound like my friend Zina.

07:36.970 --> 07:37.740
There you go.

07:37.740 --> 07:39.080
That's a smart kid.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.210
You should stick with her.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.480
No, calm down, no.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.960
She's just a friend.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.760
You know, you can talk to me about stuff, right?

07:50.980 --> 07:53.740
Anything. You know that.

07:57.420 --> 08:01.160
I would like it if we... talk more.

08:05.030 --> 08:06.080
Okay.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.260
Okay.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.640
Something's off.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.300
He's a lunatic. A lot is off.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.720
It just doesn't make any sense to me

08:17.720 --> 08:20.160
that he didn't shoot Marco at the money drop.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.900
His brain is scrambled. You read the notebooks.

08:24.100 --> 08:24.730
Yes.

08:24.730 --> 08:27.220
And he quoted his writings to Daniel Frye.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.580
Dialectics and that nonsense.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.950
- I know. - We got him.

08:32.950 --> 08:35.299
It's a good thing. Enjoy.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.960
Hey, Miss Kitty.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.470
May I please have a cigarette?

08:39.470 --> 08:41.419
- I thought you quit. - I did, but, uh,

08:41.419 --> 08:43.890
we're gonna smoke a victory cigarette. Come on.

08:45.530 --> 08:46.490
Come on.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.300
You said people stole from you.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.760
- That's right. - Did they steal your notebooks?

09:05.410 --> 09:09.590
Hell, yeah. I used to get harassed by law enforcement all the time.

09:09.910 --> 09:13.400
They'd raid me and... take my stuff.

09:13.410 --> 09:15.010
'Cause you were hunting immigrants.

09:15.010 --> 09:16.270
Not hunting.

09:16.270 --> 09:18.860
Tracking. Escorting.

09:26.070 --> 09:27.830
So who harassed you?

09:28.440 --> 09:31.440
- Cops? - And Feds.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.850
Feds, well, they-they...

09:34.170 --> 09:39.150
stormed my place and hauled off my things.

09:39.150 --> 09:40.630
Did they give some of 'em back?

09:40.630 --> 09:43.650
Yeah. But some... things...

09:44.490 --> 09:49.370
including my... key writings...

09:51.660 --> 09:53.170
they kept.

09:53.170 --> 09:54.040
That right.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.560
Power tripping. Human nature.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.500
I don't think that's true.

10:01.500 --> 10:06.040
"Slaves dream not of freedom, but of becoming masters."

10:25.870 --> 10:28.760
Holy smokes, it's Vanilla Ice.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.200
Ray. Ray.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.470
How do you like my cover?

10:34.100 --> 10:36.240
Ice Ice Baby.

10:38.090 --> 10:40.410
Nice, I'm glad this all worked out.

10:40.410 --> 10:42.200
- Brother, do I ever let you down? - Never.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.720
And don't you forget it.

10:51.180 --> 10:52.380
All right, what do you say we unload

10:52.380 --> 10:53.490
and grab a couple of beers

10:53.490 --> 10:55.170
before we hit the road to Mexico.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.120
Slow your roll there, pal. This is as far as I go.

10:58.810 --> 11:01.280
What do you mean? I thought we were in this together.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.410
That wasn't the deal, amigo.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.050
I deliver. You want to move it again,

11:04.060 --> 11:06.770
do it your own self, comprende?

11:30.960 --> 11:32.880
{an8}David Tate

11:46.240 --> 11:47.680
David Tate.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.500
- Where's Hank? - Oh, my favorit blouse.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.890
- Where's Hank? - I stood in line fo two hours...

11:57.890 --> 12:00.970
You know, two's a coincidence, three's not.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.240
Yeah, no argument there.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.540
- Morning. - Hey, hotshot.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.210
Listen, the bosses want you at the press conference.

12:08.210 --> 12:10.370
And your girl's on some new shit today.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.750
Something's going on, Marco.

12:18.870 --> 12:21.470
- What do you mean? - We have a new person of interest.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.330
No, no, no, no, no, we have Childress.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.640
I'm not sure he's the one.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.910
- Sonya, he shot you. - I know, I know,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.390
but I think he's being pointed to;

12:28.390 --> 12:29.410
set up.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.690
By who?

12:31.010 --> 12:32.820
There's this ex-FBI agent

12:32.820 --> 12:36.110
who confiscate Childress's notebook during an investigation.

12:36.110 --> 12:37.730
Never gave them back.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.890
- Which happen sometimes. - Sure.

12:39.890 --> 12:42.240
Same guy back in 2006--

12:42.240 --> 12:43.610
partnered with Gedman. 

12:45.470 --> 12:46.460
Okay.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.750
And... he wa a patient of Dr. Meadows.

12:51.630 --> 12:54.250
I mean, that's three direct links in an hour.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.360
All roads lead back to David Tate.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.120
David Tate? FBI? 

13:03.090 --> 13:04.100
You know him?

13:04.100 --> 13:06.880
We worked together on a task force.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.660
Well, does he fit the profile? 

13:10.920 --> 13:12.210
It doesn't matter.

13:13.170 --> 13:14.630
David Tate's dead.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.740
Hi. How you feeling?

13:40.510 --> 13:43.360
Like a guy who just has a big ass seizure.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.090
Why don't you stay home a while?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.590
'Cause there are more distractions here.

13:53.030 --> 13:55.050
This is for you.

13:55.410 --> 13:58.270
- What is it? - Your Christmas bonus.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.020
Biblioteca Sol?

14:00.370 --> 14:03.120
Write a puff piece. Drink some champagne.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.410
Get a glimpse of the good life in Juarez.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.010
Apparently, there is such a thing.

14:09.050 --> 14:10.560
You're passing up a party?

14:10.560 --> 14:13.690
Yeah. If I go, I will drink... a lot.

14:17.380 --> 14:20.040
- So this is the new Daniel. - I hate him.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.120
Have fun.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.530
Don't let Santi Jr. seduce you. 

14:25.610 --> 14:26.390
You know him?

14:26.390 --> 14:27.660
That's my boy.

14:27.670 --> 14:30.190
I've seen him turn a lot of gay girls straight.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.550
- Oh, you're suc a dick. - Wear a dress!

14:32.550 --> 14:34.220
You got a nice ass.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.600
A sober dick.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.200
But a dick.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.130
Oh, my God.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.880
Yes, I know. 

15:00.330 --> 15:02.190
I know. Okay, thanks.

15:03.690 --> 15:06.110
Hank thinks this is a wild goose chase.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.720
Well, we do have a guy locked up. 

15:08.720 --> 15:09.850
Just need to mak sure that

15:09.850 --> 15:11.750
David Tate is actually dead.

15:12.340 --> 15:15.060
He is. I attended his funeral.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.580
- You did? - Yes. 

15:17.940 --> 15:21.690
- Was it open casket? - No.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.810
- Buenas Dias. - Remember Sonya Cross?

15:26.810 --> 15:28.050
Buenas dias.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.750
Gracias. 

15:34.140 --> 15:35.010
Right? 

15:35.020 --> 15:37.150
And now you're investigating ghosts?

15:37.150 --> 15:39.170
We're not sure about David Tate's death.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.660
She's not sure.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.070
He's American, but died in Juarez.

15:45.650 --> 15:47.940
He came here to blow his head off.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.190
He had a lot of problems.

15:50.890 --> 15:53.570
Like what? Depression? Drugs? 

15:54.690 --> 15:57.650
A car accident kille his wife and son.

15:58.050 --> 16:01.530
After that, yes, drugs, drinking...

16:01.530 --> 16:03.660
The FBI had to let him go.

16:04.310 --> 16:05.870
It says he left a note.

16:05.870 --> 16:07.370
Yeah, but we don't have it. 

16:10.210 --> 16:12.090
And he was cremate here?

16:12.690 --> 16:14.610
His sister-in-law okayed it.

16:14.610 --> 16:15.740
Remember I told you,

16:15.740 --> 16:18.400
"From the bowl to the mouth, soup falls"?

16:18.410 --> 16:19.510
Yeah, right. 

16:19.510 --> 16:21.500
So he was unrecognizable.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.560
They ID'ed him with a driver' license that was just on him.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.200
It's totally possible that thi is not even David Tate.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.000
Sonya... 

16:29.250 --> 16:30.370
It's possible. 

16:31.130 --> 16:31.920
Yeah.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.520
We have so many murders here,

16:36.520 --> 16:38.150
we hardly investigate the suicides.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.310
- Can I have this? - Sure.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.130
- Tim? - Hey, Char. 

17:15.160 --> 17:16.270
Long time.

17:16.859 --> 17:17.790
Yeah, I'll say.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.319
You know, I heard you were doing well, but,

17:19.319 --> 17:21.450
damn girl, you're frickin' rich.

17:21.450 --> 17:22.500
Yeah. What are you doing here?

17:22.510 --> 17:24.190
Just getting up with my boy Ray. 

17:24.200 --> 17:27.680
- What's with th ice cream truck? - Oh. Well...

17:28.240 --> 17:30.270
you know how I like the little kiddies.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.400
Joking. 

17:33.820 --> 17:35.780
- Yeah. - Ray said I could stay in the pool house. 

17:35.780 --> 17:38.700
Oh, he did, huh? Where is he anyway?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.450
Oh, he's out running errands. 

17:40.460 --> 17:45.360
- You know Ray, always up to something. - Yeah... I know

17:48.510 --> 17:49.730
Tim sucks.

17:51.110 --> 17:53.150
Tim sucks Satan's cock.

17:55.730 --> 17:59.410
Tim swallows that sucksauce like it's warm beer. 

18:00.440 --> 18:01.280
Okey.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.840
Oh! Mother of pearl!

19:07.350 --> 19:08.730
I owe you so much, Mr. Linder.

19:10.010 --> 19:11.690
 I'm here to pay my debt.

19:15.130 --> 19:16.490
Debt? 

19:17.910 --> 19:19.630
There is no debt.

20:04.940 --> 20:07.400
I lost touch with David after the accident.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.240
Then he pulled a Kurt Cobain down in Juarez.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.280
Did you ever see his body?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.100
I just told them to go ahead and cremate him. 

20:17.500 --> 20:18.400
The poor guy.

20:19.620 --> 20:20.610
You liked him?

20:21.140 --> 20:22.570
I felt sorry for him.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.620
He lost his shit after Jill. 

20:25.030 --> 20:26.800
I heard he had drug problems.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.950
He had life problems.

20:29.580 --> 20:30.890
He couldn't get over it.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.810
Why was your sister going to Juarez at that hour? 

20:33.810 --> 20:35.630
Cheating, per usual.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.330
She had a... boyfriend down there?

20:38.660 --> 20:40.720
I never met him, but..

20:40.720 --> 20:42.080
she was crazy for him.

20:42.090 --> 20:44.990
But she had he 10-year-old in the car with her.

20:44.990 --> 20:46.300
She was gonna leave David. 

20:46.950 --> 20:48.660
My guess is they got in a fight that night, 

20:48.660 --> 20:51.040
she grabbed Caleb, headed to Juarez. 

20:51.040 --> 20:52.110
Never made it.

20:53.590 --> 20:54.970
Now I feel bad.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.010
Why? 

20:58.010 --> 21:00.220
You're not supposed to talk shit about the dead.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.040
It's okay to have bad memories.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.970
Well, thanks.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.470
I'm a man of my word.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.070
Do I, uh..

21:51.010 --> 21:54.400
Am I required to, uh, seal the deal again.

21:55.260 --> 21:56.630
Seal the what?

21:58.610 --> 22:03.090
Seal.. the... deal.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.640
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.900
The last time, you were begging me for it and shit.

22:15.040 --> 22:15.950
Get out.

22:27.860 --> 22:30.620
Why am I back a Childress's place? 

22:30.620 --> 22:32.290
Well, we got him dead to rights, 

22:32.290 --> 22:34.180
but now I got a bonus charge.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.600
Aren't you supposed to be taking some lost time?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.210
Whatever. I come out here, 

22:38.210 --> 22:39.360
find a crac in the cement bigger 

22:39.360 --> 22:41.540
than my Great aunt Betsy's forehead. 

22:41.540 --> 22:42.660
Get construction out here.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.270
They're bitching, moaning, 

22:43.270 --> 22:44.600
"Oh, Coop, it's nothing." 

22:44.600 --> 22:46.330
And then bang, they hit something.

22:46.330 --> 22:49.330
Is it a rock? Is it a pipe?

22:49.580 --> 22:50.410
Or..

22:56.370 --> 22:57.890
Who the heck is this?

23:02.900 --> 23:04.200
Body was I.D.'d 

23:04.210 --> 23:06.660
as Kenneth Hasting went missing in Augest six.

23:06.660 --> 23:07.730
What's his story? 

23:07.730 --> 23:09.220
He had a Minute Man chapter,

23:09.220 --> 23:10.700
bumped up against Jack's operation. 

23:10.700 --> 23:13.180
Dueling racists.  That's charming.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.810
Well, it all ended in tears. 

23:14.810 --> 23:16.900
And with Kenneth underneath concrete slab.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.740
It doesn't fit wit the other murders.

23:19.220 --> 23:19.940
Come again?  

23:19.940 --> 23:21.800
That is a-a pett kill, a rivalry.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.020
It's not our guy. 

23:23.930 --> 23:25.460
Meaning Childress is innocent.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.280
- Not innocent.  - Well, yeah. 

23:27.280 --> 23:28.900
Because when Deputy Stokes brain 

23:28.900 --> 23:30.520
matter spattered all over Marco's face,

23:30.520 --> 23:32.430
I was prett damn sure you were there.

23:32.450 --> 23:33.610
What I'm saying is

23:33.610 --> 23:36.250
maybe he was set up by David Tate.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.030
David.. 

23:39.120 --> 23:41.930
David Tate. Who's dead. 

23:41.930 --> 23:44.960
Right. According to the Juarez report.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.090
But no one I.D.'d him. There's no prints, no suicid note.

23:48.090 --> 23:48.940
It's sloppy.

23:48.940 --> 23:51.580
That's Juarez. Sloppy.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.130
He could have fake his own death,

23:53.130 --> 23:55.740
so he could plan these killings without being detected.

23:55.740 --> 23:58.250
Oh, I know you're shutting this down, Hank

23:58.730 --> 24:00.250
Sonya, it's far-fetched. 

24:00.250 --> 24:03.240
Hank, he's connected to three victims

24:03.240 --> 24:05.580
Oh, horseshit, Hank I mean, I'm sorry, 

24:05.580 --> 24:06.450
but there's got to be a limit

24:06.450 --> 24:09.420
to how much we indulge our village idio savant here.

25:46.820 --> 25:48.870
We're just colleagues at a work event.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.510
No big deal.

25:51.890 --> 25:52.840
But we're not.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.340
Well, that's the party line.

25:56.460 --> 25:57.840
Until you say otherwise.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.860
You're so easy to be with.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.790
I want you to be comfortable.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.420
I shouldn't be.

26:08.220 --> 26:09.130
But I am.

26:12.520 --> 26:17.330
The other night, um... day, actually...

26:19.140 --> 26:20.230
Yeah.

26:21.170 --> 26:22.640
That wasn't just..

26:25.480 --> 26:28.910
No. For me, either.

26:49.410 --> 26:52.230
Oh, thank goodness I was leaving you a note.

26:52.230 --> 26:53.630
I need to talk to you, Darci.

26:53.630 --> 26:55.320
Yeah, and I need to get to the CVS

26:55.320 --> 26:58.620
I got to buy one of them... their shower seats.

26:58.620 --> 27:01.190
Mom fell again, three times now,

27:01.190 --> 27:04.330
but will she use a walking stick like a sensible, 

27:04.330 --> 27:05.660
normal human being?

27:05.660 --> 27:09.240
Let's see. Oh, no, she will not. Wow, you going to church.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.710
There's some weird stuff's been going on.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.360
Weird, Steven?

27:13.370 --> 27:16.710
I seem to have a... a monkey on my back. 

27:16.710 --> 27:19.140
Well, hells bells, we all do. 

27:19.140 --> 27:20.690
Uh, I need a few days.

27:20.690 --> 27:25.160
- Uh, impossible. - No, really. Um, I-I have to take a trip.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.750
Is this about that girl?

27:27.290 --> 27:28.470
What girl?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.570
The one whose picture you carry around.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.120
- I watch you, Steven. - No. No. 

27:34.120 --> 27:35.110
Well, what then?

27:35.310 --> 27:36.410
Just...

27:37.030 --> 27:41.220
feelings and, uh, thoughts that I need to sort out.

27:41.220 --> 27:44.430
- Well, sort 'em out while you're bleaching the floor. - No. No!

27:45.710 --> 27:46.980
I'm sorry, Darci.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.910
I can't be of service at this time.

28:13.450 --> 28:14.190
Sonya.

28:17.030 --> 28:19.720
Hi. You looking for your dad?

28:20.340 --> 28:22.910
No. You. 

28:29.640 --> 28:30.940
Did you get the chocolates?

28:31.610 --> 28:32.590
That was you?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.030
I don't eat chocolate.

28:43.660 --> 28:44.490
My bad

28:46.900 --> 28:48.340
- You all right? - Yeah. 

28:49.570 --> 28:50.770
Just taking a break.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.130
Congratulations. On the arrest and all.

28:57.690 --> 28:58.520
Thanks.

29:00.850 --> 29:05.420
Um, Gus, I don't think your dad would like you sending me things.

29:05.950 --> 29:06.720
Why not?

29:07.600 --> 29:09.170
Well, I've been getting to know him,

29:09.170 --> 29:11.320
and I-I just don't think he would like that.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.110
He doesn't have to know.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.710
I don't like secrets.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.460
I guess it was kind of crazy of me

29:23.460 --> 29:25.340
to-to think you might like me, too.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.470
I'm not good with that.

29:40.910 --> 29:41.720
With what?

29:44.160 --> 29:47.330
People. Closeness.

29:48.830 --> 29:49.790
Why not?

29:57.500 --> 30:02.620
It's just... it's hard for me.

30:02.620 --> 30:04.580
I-I just don't know what people want.

30:04.930 --> 30:07.120
You know, when to talk, when not to talk.

30:07.120 --> 30:10.590
Or when to walk away, I-I just don't know.

30:12.170 --> 30:13.910
Well, I think it's hard for everyone.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.820
I'm the dummy who gave you the candy you didn't want.

30:29.510 --> 30:30.650
I better...

30:34.830 --> 30:35.900
See you around.

32:13.710 --> 32:14.740
Gracias.

32:19.890 --> 32:20.940
Daniel Frye.

32:28.810 --> 32:29.870
No.

32:42.670 --> 32:43.690
No.

33:07.870 --> 33:10.360
Whoa! Your hair looks sexy, baby.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.340
What are you doing?

33:14.430 --> 33:16.330
Just taking care of business.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.530
What's in the gym bag?

33:22.710 --> 33:23.660
Laundry.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.970
You and Tim are running some stupid scheme, aren't you?

33:25.980 --> 33:27.250
...stupid.

33:28.580 --> 33:29.990
Ray, I don't want this.

33:30.290 --> 33:31.850
You and your shady ideas.

33:31.850 --> 33:34.330
No, no, no, hey, hey listen, it's not like that.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.730
I want to be legit.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.080
I want you to be legit.

33:39.720 --> 33:43.140
I hear you, darlin'. I do.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.440
Then whatever you're up to, stop it.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.270
- Done. - I mean it.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.860
Babe, come on.

33:53.860 --> 33:56.270
Has ol' Ray Ray eve let you down.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.000
A million times.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.200
Come on.

34:03.820 --> 34:05.500
And get Tim out of my pool house.

35:01.890 --> 35:03.600
Sonya, let it rest.

35:04.070 --> 35:05.060
What?

35:06.130 --> 35:07.670
Forget about David Tate.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.560
I did. This is Kenneth Hasting,

35:10.560 --> 35:11.870
the body they found.

35:12.030 --> 35:15.170
No, that's David Tate.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.920
Marco... this is Kenneth Hasting.

35:21.430 --> 35:23.220
And he has a current driver' license.

35:34.230 --> 35:35.780
That's David Tate.

35:50.370 --> 35:51.590
I have to tell yo something. 

35:53.230 --> 35:54.270
Okay.

35:57.770 --> 35:58.890
Well, it's bad.

36:00.150 --> 36:01.270
It's gonna shock you.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.570
Uh, I've been warned.

36:08.810 --> 36:09.910
I'm pregnant.

36:13.700 --> 36:17.090
And married and... out with another man.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.990
And enjoying yourself?

36:22.850 --> 36:23.950
Yeah.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.210
Me, too.

36:29.010 --> 36:30.200
So messed up.

36:32.620 --> 36:36.050
Yes, it is. But...

36:40.250 --> 36:41.650
And you still like me.

36:44.710 --> 36:47.460
And I want to take you home with me right now.

36:49.830 --> 36:51.370
Meet me outside in five? 

36:51.740 --> 36:52.890
Yeah.

37:32.450 --> 37:33.910
You don't recognize me, do you?

37:35.120 --> 37:36.170
Sorry.

37:37.530 --> 37:39.510
Yeah, maybe you didn't check the papers

37:40.610 --> 37:42.050
after what you did.

37:44.140 --> 37:45.650
Look, I meet a lot of people..

37:45.650 --> 37:47.470
Wa... What the hell?

37:48.300 --> 37:49.180
Look at me.

37:49.180 --> 37:50.250
What...

37:50.860 --> 37:52.530
There was hit-and-run on the Bridge of the Americas,

37:52.530 --> 37:54.230
February 10, 2007.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.530
I don't know..

37:55.630 --> 37:58.330
You were driving like an asshole does,

37:58.870 --> 38:00.750
clipped Honda from behind. Flipped it.

38:00.750 --> 38:03.750
My wife was driving that car. My son was in the backseat.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.130
- They were both crushed. - It wasn't...

38:06.980 --> 38:08.620
You took my whole life away.

38:09.750 --> 38:13.390
Then just drove on, like it didn't matter at all.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.260
Well, who knows?

39:11.270 --> 39:12.850
He's not hiding anymore.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.550
This is Captain Robles. Lieutenant Wade.

39:34.920 --> 39:38.310
It seems your serial killer crossed over into Mexico.

39:41.850 --> 39:43.690
would like very much to see that bead.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.940
- You have someone in custody, no? - We do.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.070
I guess everyone makes mistakes.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.180
I would like for my detectives to collect it please.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.060
You can trust my people.

40:32.540 --> 40:33.440
Oh, Jill.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.470
I love you.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.820
You'r contaminating the crime scene!

41:44.190 --> 41:46.080
I knew Jill Tate.

41:52.420 --> 41:53.500
Friend?

41:56.630 --> 41:57.880
More than that.

41:59.690 --> 42:00.730
Sex.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.230
We had an affair while I was friends with David.

42:09.820 --> 42:12.710
Marco, you should've told me that.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.230
I didn't think it mattered.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.220
We need to tell the others.

42:19.390 --> 42:20.680
No, please.

42:20.730 --> 42:21.900
It's important.

42:24.980 --> 42:26.070
Sonya...

42:28.180 --> 42:31.710
I know I was wrong not to tell you.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.840
Were you still seeing her when she died in the hit-and-run?

42:53.960 --> 42:54.960
Yes.

42:59.750 --> 43:01.500
You're the man across the bridge.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.120
Tired? 

43:16.760 --> 43:17.840
Not really. 

43:20.080 --> 43:21.200
Me neither.

43:22.305 --> 43:28.883
