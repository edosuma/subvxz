WEBVTT

00:01.615 --> 00:02.450
Previously on Damages:

00:02.451 --> 00:04.415
We've got money, Joe.
How much money?

00:04.416 --> 00:06.271
Enough for
generations.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.639
Your father's
going to go to jail.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.707
You're my priority now.

00:09.708 --> 00:11.675
We never invested with
Louis Tobin.

00:11.676 --> 00:14.544
We gave our money to Leverett,
and Leverett gave it to Tobin.

00:14.545 --> 00:15.644
We've lost everything.

00:15.645 --> 00:17.879
I especially want to
thank my sister Ellen.

00:17.880 --> 00:22.415
Even though, uh, I've got three years on
her, Ellie's always been my big sister.

00:22.416 --> 00:23.415
PARSONS Carrie.

00:23.416 --> 00:26.487
Do you know Danielle
Marchetti? No.

00:26.488 --> 00:30.726
Your father purchased $14,000
worth of clothes for Ms. Marchetti.

00:30.727 --> 00:32.161
Were you sleeping with her?

00:32.162 --> 00:33.563
Patty will never find
her.

00:33.564 --> 00:34.231
Where is she?

00:34.232 --> 00:35.166
Hello, Danielle.

00:35.167 --> 00:35.834
Get out.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.295
Did he throw money at
you right away?

00:37.296 --> 00:39.196
Get out!

00:40.527 --> 00:43.261
Danielle Marchetti applied
for an expedited passport.

00:43.262 --> 00:45.630
So Joe must have tipped off
his father that we're onto her.

00:45.631 --> 00:49.166
If we don't find Marchetti, she's
gonna be able to travel tonight.

00:54.772 --> 00:58.508
Danielle?

00:58.576 --> 00:59.375
No, no, no, no.

00:59.376 --> 01:02.312
Danielle?

01:13.585 --> 01:15.318
Are you Marchetti?

01:15.319 --> 01:18.988
What?

01:19.056 --> 01:20.490
I'm picking up a Danielle

01:20.491 --> 01:24.326
Marchetti.

01:24.394 --> 01:26.261
Uh...

01:26.262 --> 01:27.662
Daniel, actually.

01:27.663 --> 01:28.696
Yeah, that's-that's me.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.465
You're heading to
Farmingdale Airport?

01:31.533 --> 01:32.399
Farmingdale?

01:32.400 --> 01:33.200
Right.

01:33.201 --> 01:38.604
I know I'm a little early. I just figured
since your flight's international...

01:40.273 --> 01:41.106
I'm sorry.

01:41.107 --> 01:42.974
You got, uh,
luggage inside? I do.

01:42.975 --> 01:45.643
Uh, just, um- I'm sorry.

01:45.711 --> 01:47.578
I think someone screwed up.

01:47.579 --> 01:51.481
Uh... this is embarrassing.

01:51.549 --> 01:53.716
Did... I was gonna drive myself.

01:53.784 --> 01:56.351
My assistant didn't-didn't call,
give you a call?

01:56.352 --> 01:57.719
No one called.

01:57.720 --> 01:58.620
I'm sorry.

01:58.621 --> 02:00.755
Sometimes she's, um...

02:00.823 --> 02:02.523
She...

02:02.524 --> 02:03.991
It's a real trek out here,
you know?

02:03.992 --> 02:04.658
I understand that.

02:04.659 --> 02:06.093
Next time, you're gonna get
charged for it.

02:06.094 --> 02:06.960
Okay.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.463
I appreciate it.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.531
Thank you.

02:58.084 --> 03:04.017
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

03:38.383 --> 03:40.751
Do we know what airport Danielle
Marchetti is flying out of?

03:40.752 --> 03:42.852
No, the State
Department checked for us.

03:42.853 --> 03:47.791
She's not scheduled on any private or commercial
flight leaving tonight from the tristate area.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.893
What about the address she used
on her passport application?

03:50.894 --> 03:51.760
It was bogus.

03:51.761 --> 03:54.529
But the health club where
she worked is still open.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.396
I spoke to the manager.

03:55.397 --> 03:57.131
He's going to let
me check her file.

03:57.132 --> 03:58.365
Good.

03:58.366 --> 04:03.604
Even if we figure out what airport she's leaving from,
we don't have the authority to keep her in the country.

04:03.605 --> 04:05.338
Just find her.

04:05.339 --> 04:07.339
I'll worry about the rest.

04:11.144 --> 04:13.579
Is the plane on time?
I'm afraid not.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.113
There's been a slight delay.

04:15.114 --> 04:16.781
Weather over the Gulf.

04:16.781 --> 04:18.281
What's the new departure time?

04:18.283 --> 04:20.250
It's scheduled for 11:08 p.m.

04:20.317 --> 04:22.218
Jesus.

04:22.285 --> 04:24.186
That's four hours from now.

04:24.253 --> 04:25.053
I know.

04:25.054 --> 04:27.221
But, uh, it's the
best we can do.

04:27.222 --> 04:28.855
You arrange
everything else?

04:28.856 --> 04:29.723
Yes, sir.

04:29.724 --> 04:31.758
And, uh, customs won't be a
problem.

04:31.759 --> 04:34.994
Neither you nor Ms. Marchetti
are on the flight manifest.

04:34.996 --> 04:36.697
Let me know if anything
else comes up.

04:36.698 --> 04:39.801
We got to fly her out tonight.

04:44.106 --> 04:46.272
I'm so sorry about that, Janine.

04:46.340 --> 04:51.074
No, um, Mrs. Tobin warned me when she
gave me your number, "He's a busy man."

04:51.075 --> 04:52.474
And I have been...

04:52.475 --> 04:55.011
and I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

04:55.012 --> 04:57.746
Oh, well, Marilyn's wonderful.

04:57.747 --> 05:01.215
Yeah.

05:01.283 --> 05:03.550
They, um, they don't let Mrs.

05:03.618 --> 05:05.185
Tobin come in the salon anymore,

05:05.186 --> 05:07.053
so I go to her.

05:07.054 --> 05:08.821
And I'm-I'm happy to do it.

05:08.822 --> 05:10.623
You know, she-she really got a

05:10.624 --> 05:12.991
bad rap, what, with her husband

05:13.059 --> 05:16.460
and all of that.

05:16.528 --> 05:20.397
She sure did.

05:20.465 --> 05:23.466
Um, you are a lawyer?

05:23.467 --> 05:25.434
I am.

05:26.336 --> 05:27.970
Um, how is that?

05:27.971 --> 05:28.904
Do you ever feel

05:28.905 --> 05:31.139
blessed?

05:31.206 --> 05:33.340
Um, I-I do.

05:33.408 --> 05:34.641
I do, absolutely.

05:34.642 --> 05:37.177
I have a lot of great friends

05:37.244 --> 05:39.178
down at the salon.

05:39.246 --> 05:40.313
Well, that's how I

05:40.314 --> 05:43.715
feel about the law.

05:45.684 --> 05:46.617
Heading out?

05:46.618 --> 05:47.284
Dinner with my

05:47.285 --> 05:48.418
family.

05:48.419 --> 05:49.886
Uh-oh.

05:49.887 --> 05:52.055
An evening with Gary and Denise.

05:52.122 --> 05:52.955
My sister's

05:52.956 --> 05:54.056
coming from Oregon.

05:54.057 --> 05:55.958
Oh, triple whammy.

05:56.026 --> 05:56.758
No, it's great.

05:56.759 --> 05:57.926
I get to meet my niece.

05:57.927 --> 05:59.060
Oh, that's right.

05:59.061 --> 06:00.194
You're an aunt now.

06:00.195 --> 06:01.128
Crazy, huh?

06:01.129 --> 06:02.195
Is, uh,

06:02.196 --> 06:03.096
what's-his-name coming?

06:03.097 --> 06:04.063
The husband.

06:04.064 --> 06:04.964
No. Thank God.

06:04.965 --> 06:05.698
He's stuck at work.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.665
His boss wouldn't let him off.

06:06.666 --> 06:07.666
Well, sounds like a

06:07.667 --> 06:08.333
party.

06:08.334 --> 06:09.101
Rock it out.

06:09.102 --> 06:09.935
You gonna hold down

06:09.936 --> 06:10.602
the fort?

06:10.603 --> 06:11.370
Yeah, someone's got

06:11.371 --> 06:12.037
to.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.138
This Tobin case is never

06:13.139 --> 06:13.939
gonna end.

06:13.940 --> 06:14.773
Have a blast.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.744
Thank you.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.545
Mmm.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.880
Mmm?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.048
See what I mean?

06:22.049 --> 06:22.882
I do.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.783
It's very, um, effervescent.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.585
Wait, is that, is that a word?

06:25.586 --> 06:26.252
Yes.

06:26.253 --> 06:26.920
Is it? Okay.

06:26.921 --> 06:27.620
It certainly is a

06:27.621 --> 06:28.287
word.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.655
Oh.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.322
Darn it.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.690
I'm sor- Last one, Janine.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.159
Sorry.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.327
Okay, this is a client.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.596
So I'll-I'll be a minute.

06:37.663 --> 06:38.830
Just take your time,

06:38.831 --> 06:41.232
'cause I wld hate to stand in

06:41.300 --> 06:43.200
the way of justice.

06:44.535 --> 06:47.103
One second.

06:47.171 --> 06:49.071
Hey, Joe, what's up?

06:50.740 --> 06:51.606
Wait.

06:51.607 --> 06:53.607
Tell me where you are.

06:56.444 --> 06:57.744
Patty.

06:57.745 --> 06:59.345
Ellen.

06:59.346 --> 07:00.313
ARSONSWhat are you doing

07:00.314 --> 07:00.980
here?

07:00.981 --> 07:03.582
Seeing your boss.

07:03.650 --> 07:04.783
You're leaving early.

07:04.784 --> 07:06.318
I'm going to Jersey.

07:06.319 --> 07:08.153
Parsons family dinner.

07:08.154 --> 07:09.287
Oh.

07:09.288 --> 07:11.321
The name you gave Tom turned out

07:11.389 --> 07:12.389
to be significant.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.156
Have you subpoenaed

07:13.157 --> 07:13.823
her?

07:13.824 --> 07:14.757
Trying to.

07:14.758 --> 07:16.158
She's, uh, not very keen on

07:16.159 --> 07:18.059
being found.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.694
But thank you.

07:20.762 --> 07:22.596
And if you ever need anything...

07:22.597 --> 07:23.330
No.

07:23.331 --> 07:24.331
It was a one-off.

07:24.332 --> 07:26.065
Tom came to me and I was happy

07:26.066 --> 07:26.799
to help.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.433
But, uh, that's it for me in

07:28.434 --> 07:30.135
the Tobin case.

07:30.136 --> 07:31.171
Are you sure you don't

07:31.172 --> 07:34.613
want to stick around?

07:34.681 --> 07:36.281
I think this witness is trying

07:36.282 --> 07:37.315
to flee the country.

07:37.316 --> 07:40.552
It could be an exciting night.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.386
I bet.

07:41.387 --> 07:42.487
But, uh, I have a train to

07:42.488 --> 07:43.288
catch, so...

07:43.289 --> 07:44.155
Oh, right, right,

07:44.156 --> 07:45.123
right, of course.

07:45.124 --> 07:46.690
Family.

07:46.691 --> 07:48.725
Your top priority.

07:57.534 --> 07:58.767
I'm sorry, I'm

07:58.768 --> 08:00.702
running a little late.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.504
Well, it's almost 7:30.

08:02.505 --> 08:03.171
I know.

08:03.172 --> 08:04.672
I'm trying to find a witness

08:04.673 --> 08:06.340
who may be fleeing the country.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.174
Doesn't Patty have

08:07.175 --> 08:08.742
anyone eo that?

08:08.743 --> 08:09.843
No, I don't want

08:09.844 --> 08:10.777
anyone else doing it.

08:10.778 --> 08:11.745
It too important.

08:11.746 --> 08:12.946
pents are

08:12.947 --> 08:14.214
gonna be here any minute, and

08:14.215 --> 08:15.481
I thought we were going to tell

08:15.482 --> 08:16.149
them together.

08:16.150 --> 08:16.849
We will.

08:16.850 --> 08:18.283
Look, I'm the one who got your

08:18.284 --> 08:20.553
parents to invest with Tobin.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.454
I want to be the one to explain

08:22.455 --> 08:23.255
it to them.

08:23.256 --> 08:24.489
You really think this

08:24.490 --> 08:25.624
witness could help your case?

08:25.625 --> 08:27.459
This is the best lead

08:27.460 --> 08:30.327
we have right now.

08:30.395 --> 08:31.461
All right, babe.

08:31.462 --> 08:32.995
Do what you have to do.

08:32.996 --> 08:34.063
Look, have dinner

08:34.063 --> 08:35.230
with your folks.

08:35.231 --> 08:36.831
I promise you I'll be there

08:36.832 --> 08:37.898
by dessert.

08:37.899 --> 08:40.433
We'll tell them together.

09:05.191 --> 09:07.692
What happened?

09:07.760 --> 09:10.094
I hit you with my car.

09:14.099 --> 09:15.198
Oh, yeah, I was

09:15.199 --> 09:17.033
looking for my cat.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.368
Yeah. Put this o

09:18.369 --> 09:20.369
your face.

09:23.707 --> 09:24.440
How long was I

09:24.441 --> 09:26.508
out?

09:26.576 --> 09:28.243
I don't know.

09:28.244 --> 09:30.878
Just a little while.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.347
Oh, my head hurts.

09:33.415 --> 09:35.649
I called for help,

09:35.717 --> 09:38.184
so don't worry.

09:42.989 --> 09:44.123
My whole side

09:44.124 --> 09:45.190
is sore.

09:45.191 --> 09:47.192
Here.

09:50.629 --> 09:52.529
What time is it?

09:52.564 --> 09:53.464
Why, you have someplace

09:53.465 --> 09:56.333
to be?

09:59.169 --> 10:01.170
Stay down.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.543
Oh!

10:07.611 --> 10:08.443
Jesus, Joe,

10:08.444 --> 10:11.346
what's going on?

10:11.414 --> 10:13.481
Where is she?

10:13.549 --> 10:15.349
In the other room.

10:15.350 --> 10:16.484
What are you

10:16.485 --> 10:18.819
doing here?

10:22.787 --> 10:24.619
Did you know my father

10:24.620 --> 10:25.886
was sleeping with Danielle

10:25.887 --> 10:26.720
Marchetti?

10:26.721 --> 10:27.387
No.

10:27.388 --> 10:28.387
Did you, Lenny?

10:28.388 --> 10:29.789
No. He told me

10:29.790 --> 10:32.324
after you confronted him.

10:35.393 --> 10:37.394
I'm sorry.

10:38.396 --> 10:39.729
Why is he putting her

10:39.730 --> 10:40.797
on an airplane tonight?

10:40.798 --> 10:42.098
All he said was

10:42.099 --> 10:43.399
he didn't want Patty Hewes

10:43.400 --> 10:44.367
questioning her.

10:44.368 --> 10:47.103
Oh. Then Danielle must

10:47.171 --> 10:49.306
know about the money.

10:49.374 --> 10:50.040
Jesus Christ!

10:50.041 --> 10:51.709
Could he be that goddamn stupid

10:51.710 --> 10:53.377
to put his whole family's future

10:53.378 --> 10:56.212
in her hands?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.847
Her?!

10:57.848 --> 10:59.882
Joe, I'm as much in

10:59.950 --> 11:02.518
the dark as you are.

11:02.586 --> 11:04.686
But she is in there, and we need

11:04.754 --> 11:06.521
to decide what to do with her.

11:06.522 --> 11:08.389
We don't have a choice.

11:08.390 --> 11:09.857
If she knows about the money,

11:09.858 --> 11:11.725
we get her out of the country.

11:11.726 --> 11:13.593
I think we have to

11:13.594 --> 11:15.594
do that.

11:24.468 --> 11:25.235
Patty?

11:25.236 --> 11:26.703
Curtis, I was asked

11:26.704 --> 11:27.837
to wait.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.371
You're off to a fund-raiser?

11:29.372 --> 11:30.405
A wake, actually.

11:30.406 --> 11:31.205
My great-uncle.

11:31.206 --> 11:32.407
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:32.408 --> 11:33.775
Man was a prick,

11:33.776 --> 11:34.642
but thanks.

11:34.643 --> 11:35.576
I'm afraid this

11:35.577 --> 11:38.279
is urgent.

11:38.346 --> 11:40.480
Danielle Marchetti.

11:40.548 --> 11:42.115
She used to be the

11:42.116 --> 11:43.183
receptionist at Louis Tobin's

11:43.184 --> 11:43.850
health club.

11:43.851 --> 11:44.717
Your people questioned her

11:44.718 --> 11:46.218
a couple of months ago.

11:46.219 --> 11:47.019
And?

11:47.020 --> 11:48.687
She and Tobin may have

11:48.688 --> 11:49.988
been having an affair, but

11:49.989 --> 11:51.656
that's not the exciting part.

11:51.657 --> 11:52.824
You think she might

11:52.825 --> 11:53.758
be involved in the fraud?

11:53.759 --> 11:54.425
Yes.

11:54.426 --> 11:55.326
I also think she's trying

11:55.327 --> 11:57.328
to flee the country tonight.

11:59.497 --> 12:01.364
Uh, Sheryl, can you

12:01.365 --> 12:02.765
track down Judge Reilly's cell

12:02.766 --> 12:03.766
number for me?

12:03.767 --> 12:05.167
You have a flight number?

12:05.168 --> 12:06.001
Not yet.

12:06.002 --> 12:07.268
So you'll talk to Reilly?

12:07.269 --> 12:07.936
Yeah.

12:07.937 --> 12:09.437
We'll need a warrant to detain

12:09.438 --> 12:10.104
Marchetti.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.106
What do you have on her?

12:16.343 --> 12:17.777
This is nothing.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.244
Patty, you're asking me to

12:19.245 --> 12:20.345
detain her without evidence?

12:20.346 --> 12:21.546
I'm asking you to

12:21.547 --> 12:22.814
prevent a person of interest

12:22.815 --> 12:23.748
from fleeing the country.

12:23.749 --> 12:24.849
Based on a hunch?

12:24.850 --> 12:25.616
You're the court-appointed

12:25.617 --> 12:26.651
trustee. There are rules.

12:26.652 --> 12:28.519
I know you're not used to that.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.953
This woman could prove

12:29.954 --> 12:31.054
critical to our case.

12:31.055 --> 12:32.756
If you let her slip through our

12:32.757 --> 12:34.123
hands, we'll both regret it.

12:34.124 --> 12:35.157
Well, then give me

12:35.158 --> 12:37.626
something real.

12:37.694 --> 12:39.194
I'm sorry, I can't detain her

12:39.195 --> 12:41.296
without cause.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.927
She's beautiful.

12:50.928 --> 12:52.829
She's perfect.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.433
Here you go.

12:56.501 --> 12:57.601
Did you pump?

12:57.602 --> 12:59.537
No, it's organic
formula.

12:59.538 --> 13:00.604
Charlotte loves it.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.606
Oh, you're not
breast-feeding?

13:02.607 --> 13:06.510
Oh, she had trouble latching on at first,
and my nipples got all cracked, so...

13:07.512 --> 13:09.412
Not at my table.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.447
Your father's
squeamish.

13:11.448 --> 13:13.549
I'm not squeamish.
I'm eating.

13:13.550 --> 13:16.152
And I gotta tell ya, formula's
no good.

13:16.153 --> 13:17.053
It's fine.

13:17.054 --> 13:18.488
I looked it up online.

13:18.489 --> 13:20.457
There's nothing wrong
with formula.

13:20.458 --> 13:24.310
I'm telling you girls,
when you were babies,

13:24.311 --> 13:28.163
your mother never
would've dreamed of it.

13:28.231 --> 13:30.500
Say, whatever happened
to that guy you were

13:30.501 --> 13:32.769
seeing with the, uh,
with the cowboy name?

13:32.770 --> 13:33.837
Wes.

13:33.838 --> 13:36.106
Uh, that ended a few months
back.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.342
We never even got to meet him.

13:38.343 --> 13:42.546
It's not a big deal. I don't
even know what he's doing anymore.

13:42.547 --> 13:44.749
I'm sorry that Eddie couldn't
make it.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.484
I was looking forward to
seeing him.

13:46.485 --> 13:48.753
Yeah, he really
wanted to make the trip,

13:48.754 --> 13:50.322
but, you know, just bad timing.

13:50.323 --> 13:51.856
League semifinals.

13:51.857 --> 13:54.258
You know how Eddie is and
his sports.

13:54.259 --> 13:56.693
Bowling's not
a sport.

13:56.694 --> 13:59.762
I thought you said
he was working.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.964
I did?

14:02.032 --> 14:02.698
Yes.

14:02.699 --> 14:05.435
Well, who can keep
track of these things?

14:05.436 --> 14:07.604
Nice priorities;

14:07.672 --> 14:10.340
bowling over family.

14:15.347 --> 14:18.916
Danielle stopped working at the
health club a few months ago,

14:18.917 --> 14:22.486
but she had a forwarding address that
she wants her last check to be sent to.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.653
I'm heading there now.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.121
All right.

14:25.122 --> 14:27.857
Where did you get
with the D.A.'s office?

14:27.858 --> 14:29.192
Nowhere.

14:29.193 --> 14:31.493
Curtis Gates is determined to
play by the rules.

14:31.494 --> 14:36.832
So unless we find her first, Danielle
Marchetti is free to leave the country.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.835
All right, I'll be in
touch.

14:44.373 --> 14:46.740
You remember Lenny.

14:49.075 --> 14:50.975
Barely.

14:51.945 --> 14:54.513
It's been a while.

14:54.581 --> 14:55.949
I'm sorry this

14:55.950 --> 14:58.417
happened, and I know you've

14:58.485 --> 15:00.617
been shaken up, but we need to

15:00.685 --> 15:01.685
know if you're on board with

15:01.686 --> 15:04.687
Louis' plan.

15:06.956 --> 15:07.989
We know about your

15:07.990 --> 15:10.357
flight.

15:10.425 --> 15:12.127
I need to see

15:12.128 --> 15:12.794
a doctor.

15:12.795 --> 15:13.861
I've already

15:13.862 --> 15:16.597
arranged one. He's on his way.

15:19.034 --> 15:20.868
Okay. If he says

15:20.869 --> 15:23.304
I'm safe to fly, then I'll go.

15:23.372 --> 15:25.573
Your father wants me on that

15:25.640 --> 15:26.640
plane.

15:26.641 --> 15:28.242
And you give my father

15:28.243 --> 15:31.579
anything he wants, don't you?

15:32.781 --> 15:33.948
Where are you

15:33.949 --> 15:34.615
going?

15:34.616 --> 15:36.617
I need some air.

15:43.055 --> 15:44.521
Hey, what happened to

15:44.522 --> 15:45.188
your wake?

15:45.189 --> 15:46.556
He'll still be dead

15:46.557 --> 15:47.223
at the funeral.

15:47.224 --> 15:48.190
Did you find anything?

15:48.191 --> 15:49.324
No, and I've been

15:49.325 --> 15:50.458
through everything we've got on

15:50.459 --> 15:51.125
Marchetti.

15:51.126 --> 15:52.226
Who did the interview

15:52.227 --> 15:53.560
with her at the-the health club.

15:53.561 --> 15:54.924
I did, a month and a

15:54.925 --> 15:55.592
half ago.

15:55.593 --> 15:57.257
I got the transcript right here.

15:57.258 --> 15:59.524
I don't like Patty knowing
something that we don't.

15:59.525 --> 16:01.588
Boss, I'm telling you
I talked to Marchetti.

16:01.589 --> 16:02.487
There's nothing in here.

16:02.488 --> 16:05.115
Well, then why does Patty
want me to detain her?

16:05.116 --> 16:07.446
I don't know.
Maybe she's wrong.

16:07.447 --> 16:10.376
Or maybe she's keeping evidence
from us.

16:10.377 --> 16:12.406
Just give me that.

16:59.143 --> 17:02.344
Danielle Marchetti?

17:10.652 --> 17:13.386
Miss Marchetti?

17:43.477 --> 17:46.012
âª âª

18:00.588 --> 18:02.488
Can I help you?

18:02.522 --> 18:05.090
Oh, uh, do you
live around here?

18:05.091 --> 18:06.191
Yeah, across the street.

18:06.192 --> 18:08.060
I'm looking for a

18:08.061 --> 18:09.561
Danielle Marchetti.

18:09.562 --> 18:11.194
I think she lives here.

18:11.195 --> 18:12.829
Danielle- yeah, sure.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.396
Terrific girl.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.865
She helps me wife with
the shopping once in a while.

18:16.866 --> 18:18.600
When was the
last time you saw her?

18:18.601 --> 18:20.668
Well, I can't say for sure.

18:20.669 --> 18:22.036
She in some kind of trouble?

18:22.037 --> 18:25.104
No, I just, uh, I just
wanted to talk to her.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.973
Well, I'll be
sure to tell her.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.107
Great. Thank you.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.109
Good night.

18:40.115 --> 18:41.749
Hey, Patty.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.383
I'm at Danielle Marchetti's.

18:43.384 --> 18:46.619
There's a car in the driveway,
but no one seems to be home.

18:47.622 --> 18:51.958
Um, call me when you get this.

18:52.025 --> 18:53.359
Hey, Deb.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.995
No, I haven't been able to find
her.

18:56.996 --> 18:58.898
I don't think traffic's going to
be a problem.

18:58.899 --> 19:02.200
Just tell your mom and dad I'm
on my way.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.220
Leonard, you still here?

19:26.524 --> 19:29.092
Thank you for
coming.

19:29.093 --> 19:31.794
You know, some guy was
snooping around out there.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.961
Tom Shayes.

19:32.962 --> 19:34.463
He works for Patty Hewes.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.330
Did he see you?

19:35.331 --> 19:36.632
No. He's gone now.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.633
Good.

19:39.835 --> 19:41.269
This way, Dr. Brandt.

19:41.270 --> 19:43.440
Patient's in here.

19:54.784 --> 19:58.454
Just relax.

19:58.521 --> 20:00.323
That hurt?

20:00.324 --> 20:02.325
Yeah.

20:06.197 --> 20:08.331
What do you think?

20:08.399 --> 20:10.166
How did this happen?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.501
She fell on the stairs.

20:14.403 --> 20:16.403
What-what does it matter?

20:16.470 --> 20:18.370
Can she fly, Karl?

20:27.009 --> 20:27.708
Looking for

20:27.709 --> 20:28.374
something?

20:28.375 --> 20:30.108
Someone.

20:30.109 --> 20:31.575
Having any luck?

20:31.576 --> 20:33.310
No.

20:33.311 --> 20:34.845
That's why I need you.

20:34.846 --> 20:36.813
Can you stick around here for

20:36.881 --> 20:37.947
a while?

20:37.948 --> 20:38.948
I have no plans.

20:38.949 --> 20:40.283
What do you have in mind?

20:40.284 --> 20:41.284
I'll tell you later.

20:41.285 --> 20:42.552
I have to make a phone call

20:42.553 --> 20:44.554
first.

20:46.056 --> 20:47.457
She's definitely

20:47.458 --> 20:48.926
sustained a concussion.

20:48.927 --> 20:50.560
I'm a little worried that her

20:50.561 --> 20:51.927
rib may be broken.

20:51.928 --> 20:52.961
Karl, we need to

20:52.962 --> 20:55.563
know if she can fly.

20:55.631 --> 20:56.564
If this were any

20:56.565 --> 20:57.598
other patient, I'd say get her

20:57.599 --> 20:59.870
to a hospital.

20:59.938 --> 21:01.873
But if it's necessary...

21:01.941 --> 21:05.210
She needs to be watched to make

21:05.277 --> 21:07.412
sure there are no complications.

21:07.479 --> 21:08.780
What time's the flight?

21:08.781 --> 21:10.148
11:00.

21:10.149 --> 21:11.216
Observe her until

21:11.217 --> 21:12.284
then.

21:12.285 --> 21:13.753
And make sure her speech remains

21:13.754 --> 21:15.189
lucid.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.090
Now if she seems to start to

21:17.091 --> 21:18.525
slur her words or seems a little

21:18.526 --> 21:20.426
light-headed, or if that nausea

21:20.460 --> 21:22.529
get any worse, you need to get

21:22.596 --> 21:24.397
her right to a hospital.

21:24.398 --> 21:25.231
Karl, we can't

21:25.232 --> 21:26.265
thank you enough.

21:26.266 --> 21:28.702
Thank you.

21:32.873 --> 21:34.606
Are you okay?

21:34.607 --> 21:35.874
You-you look a little...

21:35.875 --> 21:37.775
I'm fine.

21:42.785 --> 21:44.352
Leonard Winstone

21:44.353 --> 21:45.252
speaking.

21:45.253 --> 21:47.687
This is Patty Hewes.

21:47.755 --> 21:49.255
What a pleasant

21:49.256 --> 21:51.090
surprise.

21:51.091 --> 21:53.059
But, uh, perhaps I could call

21:53.126 --> 21:55.026
you back first thing tomorrow?

21:55.061 --> 21:56.761
I know about Danielle

21:56.762 --> 21:58.196
Marchetti.

21:58.197 --> 21:59.797
I'm not familiar

21:59.798 --> 22:00.999
with that name.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.367
Then you won't mind if

22:02.368 --> 22:03.601
I leak her affair with Louis

22:03.602 --> 22:05.903
Tobin to the press.

22:05.971 --> 22:07.304
Ms. Hewes...

22:07.305 --> 22:08.572
I'm waiting for you in

22:08.573 --> 22:10.341
my office.

22:10.342 --> 22:12.242
In 30 minutes, everything I've

22:12.280 --> 22:15.683
got gets released to the Post.

22:19.054 --> 22:20.455
What?

22:20.456 --> 22:21.823
I have to, uh, meet

22:21.824 --> 22:23.293
Patty Hewes.

22:23.294 --> 22:24.560
What does she want?

22:24.561 --> 22:25.327
Uh, she's

22:25.328 --> 22:26.328
threatening to release your

22:26.329 --> 22:28.332
father's affair to the press.

22:30.404 --> 22:31.372
This is Danielle

22:31.373 --> 22:32.473
Marchetti.

22:32.474 --> 22:35.009
We spoke a while back.

22:35.077 --> 22:36.878
I think that we need to talk

22:36.879 --> 22:38.814
again.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.116
Please call me.

22:40.117 --> 22:41.284
I'll stay here and

22:41.285 --> 22:43.285
watch her.

22:45.054 --> 22:46.020
You okay doing

22:46.021 --> 22:47.187
that?

22:47.188 --> 22:49.789
Why wouldn't I be?

22:49.857 --> 22:52.224
All right, uh,

22:52.292 --> 22:53.592
well, then meet me at

22:53.593 --> 22:55.927
Farmingdale Airport, hangar 6.

22:55.995 --> 22:57.995
Flight's at 11:08, okay?

23:01.431 --> 23:04.165
You find anything?

23:04.232 --> 23:05.632
No. You?

23:05.633 --> 23:07.000
Why the hell do you

23:07.001 --> 23:08.100
think I'm asking you?

23:08.101 --> 23:08.968
Call your wife.

23:08.969 --> 23:10.135
Tell her you're not coming home

23:10.136 --> 23:10.935
tonight.

23:10.936 --> 23:12.936
I'm not married.

23:14.538 --> 23:17.171
Jesus- how long have I worked

23:17.239 --> 23:19.405
here?

23:30.811 --> 23:31.811
Dad, where does

23:31.812 --> 23:33.378
this go?

23:33.379 --> 23:34.746
That one?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.247
No idea.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.248
Ask your mother.

23:40.218 --> 23:41.586
You know, you're looking good,

23:41.587 --> 23:43.188
kid.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.791
You seem happier than usual.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.527
Thanks, Dad.

24:01.736 --> 24:03.570
Hey, Mom, where's this go?

24:03.571 --> 24:05.271
Oh, I'll put it away,

24:05.272 --> 24:07.273
honey.

24:18.654 --> 24:20.021
I never meant to

24:20.022 --> 24:22.022
hurt you.

24:26.161 --> 24:29.098
You asked when it started.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.933
I'll tell you if you still want

24:30.934 --> 24:32.834
to know.

24:39.541 --> 24:41.041
Was it when you were still

24:41.042 --> 24:43.043
with me?

24:46.013 --> 24:48.280
Yes.

24:54.788 --> 24:57.123
When?

24:57.124 --> 24:58.357
About a year

24:58.358 --> 25:01.360
before you went into rehab.

25:04.231 --> 25:06.065
I'm sorry, Joe- you were a

25:06.066 --> 25:08.267
wreck.

25:08.335 --> 25:10.970
So you dump me, and you

25:11.038 --> 25:13.039
start with my father.

25:16.910 --> 25:18.778
I don't know what

25:18.779 --> 25:20.780
you want me to say.

25:27.154 --> 25:30.956
Joe...

25:31.024 --> 25:32.691
it wasn't what you think.

25:32.692 --> 25:34.259
You don't know what I

25:34.260 --> 25:37.362
think.

25:37.430 --> 25:39.331
He did it for you,

25:39.399 --> 25:40.799
you know.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.801
What?

25:45.438 --> 25:47.372
You were a wreck,

25:47.440 --> 25:48.840
so he did it.

25:48.841 --> 25:50.909
What? He did what?

25:50.977 --> 25:53.111
DANIELLE He was only

25:53.179 --> 25:56.281
on and off.

25:56.349 --> 26:00.351
So he did it.

26:00.418 --> 26:02.085
I don't... I don't want to wreck

26:02.086 --> 26:05.789
anymore.

26:05.857 --> 26:08.458
So you start with my father.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.059
Danielle...

26:10.060 --> 26:13.062
what are you talking about?

26:13.129 --> 26:14.463
He wrecked it on

26:14.464 --> 26:15.397
and off.

26:15.398 --> 26:19.100
Danielle?

26:19.167 --> 26:20.467
Just say what you

26:20.468 --> 26:23.537
want me to say.

26:23.604 --> 26:27.473
JOE Shit.

26:27.541 --> 26:29.641
I thought you should

26:29.709 --> 26:32.844
see this.

26:32.911 --> 26:34.145
What is it?

26:34.146 --> 26:35.212
My statement to the

26:35.213 --> 26:38.214
press about Danielle Marchetti.

26:45.055 --> 26:46.922
It's very well

26:46.923 --> 26:50.226
written.

26:50.294 --> 26:52.394
But I don't think you want to do

26:52.462 --> 26:53.729
this.

26:53.730 --> 26:55.130
Why not?

26:55.131 --> 26:56.064
Because not one

26:56.065 --> 26:58.066
word of that is true.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.238
Tell me where she is.

27:03.239 --> 27:04.706
I couldn't even

27:04.707 --> 27:06.274
tell you who she is.

27:06.275 --> 27:07.842
I'm trying to do you a

27:07.843 --> 27:09.444
favor, Mr. Winstone.

27:09.445 --> 27:11.880
The choice is yours.

27:11.947 --> 27:13.348
Either deal with this privately

27:13.349 --> 27:15.383
tonight, or explain to your

27:15.451 --> 27:17.119
clients in the morning why you

27:17.120 --> 27:18.554
let the whole world know that

27:18.555 --> 27:20.555
Louis Tobin was screwing a towel

27:20.623 --> 27:22.625
girl half his age.

27:26.632 --> 27:28.532
I wonder what option Mrs. Tobin

27:28.600 --> 27:32.502
would prefer?

27:32.570 --> 27:35.305
I... appreciate the

27:35.372 --> 27:37.340
courtesy call, but I'm not

27:37.407 --> 27:38.674
worried about Marilyn.

27:38.675 --> 27:39.842
No?

27:39.843 --> 27:41.176
I'm just worried

27:41.177 --> 27:42.678
about the truth.

27:42.679 --> 27:44.846
And that woman...

27:44.914 --> 27:46.648
has nothing to do with the

27:46.649 --> 27:49.618
Tobins.

27:49.685 --> 27:51.419
Well, then it's my

27:51.420 --> 27:53.421
mistake.

27:56.025 --> 27:58.059
I'm sorry for getting you all

27:58.127 --> 28:02.463
the way down here for nothing.

28:21.484 --> 28:22.317
Hello?

28:22.318 --> 28:23.752
Hey, it's Joe.

28:23.753 --> 28:25.620
Oh. How's the girl?

28:25.621 --> 28:26.922
I don't...

28:26.923 --> 28:28.356
Something's wrong.

28:28.357 --> 28:29.991
Uh, her nose is bleeding, she

28:29.992 --> 28:31.892
can't finish sentences.

28:31.928 --> 28:33.361
Well, it could be a

28:33.362 --> 28:35.230
subdural hematoma- bleeding

28:35.231 --> 28:36.398
in the brain.

28:36.399 --> 28:38.066
Well...

28:38.067 --> 28:39.468
what happens if she flies?

28:39.469 --> 28:40.603
Fly? She can't fly.

28:40.604 --> 28:42.205
You need to get her to a

28:42.206 --> 28:44.874
hospital.

28:44.941 --> 28:46.842
You hear me?

28:46.909 --> 28:48.610
Uh, yes.

28:48.611 --> 28:50.411
Joe... you put her on

28:50.412 --> 28:54.981
that plane, and she will die.

28:55.049 --> 28:57.583
I understand.

29:14.765 --> 29:15.965
Yeah?

29:15.966 --> 29:17.066
This is Chris Sharp

29:17.067 --> 29:18.334
from the District Attorney's

29:18.335 --> 29:19.035
Office.

29:19.036 --> 29:20.369
I'm returning Miss Marchetti's

29:20.370 --> 29:22.370
call.

29:26.374 --> 29:28.409
Well, that's weird.

29:28.476 --> 29:31.011
A guy answered and he hung up.

29:31.078 --> 29:32.579
Next time keep your

29:32.580 --> 29:35.748
damn cell phone on you. Okay?

29:39.218 --> 29:40.952
(Danielle sniffles, clears

29:40.953 --> 29:42.454
throat)

29:42.455 --> 29:43.889
What'd the doctor

29:43.890 --> 29:46.858
say?

29:46.926 --> 29:48.526
Uh, he said you need to

29:48.527 --> 29:50.294
stay hydrated...

29:50.295 --> 29:53.163
and not to take any aspirin, but

29:53.230 --> 29:56.399
it's nothing to worry about.

29:56.466 --> 29:58.467
Okay, good.

30:06.909 --> 30:09.377
You're good to go.

30:16.235 --> 30:18.135
Yeah.

30:18.170 --> 30:20.804
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

30:20.872 --> 30:23.040
Hi, Ginny.

30:23.107 --> 30:25.007
Art.

30:26.344 --> 30:28.846
Hi. Sorry.

30:28.913 --> 30:29.980
Thank you.

30:29.981 --> 30:30.847
Get yourself the

30:30.848 --> 30:32.215
steak frites- it's delicious.

30:32.216 --> 30:33.483
I had the halibut.

30:33.484 --> 30:34.384
Uh, not a fan.

30:34.385 --> 30:35.552
I'm actually, I'm not

30:35.553 --> 30:36.386
very hungry.

30:36.387 --> 30:37.287
Um...

30:37.288 --> 30:38.654
Uh, Tom and I really

30:38.655 --> 30:40.123
just wanted to talk to you guys.

30:40.124 --> 30:41.257
Your husband's been

30:41.258 --> 30:42.558
running around all day- let

30:42.559 --> 30:43.559
the man eat.

30:43.560 --> 30:44.526
No, no, no,

30:44.527 --> 30:46.528
I'm-I'm-m fine.âª

30:56.707 --> 30:58.208
Um...

30:58.209 --> 31:00.543
I'm sorry, I just need one more

31:00.611 --> 31:01.644
minute.

31:01.645 --> 31:03.646
I'll be right back.

31:07.685 --> 31:09.285
Patty. Yeah.

31:09.286 --> 31:13.089
They were still in the house.

31:13.157 --> 31:15.058
Look, write this down.

31:15.159 --> 31:16.960
It's a license plate number.

31:16.961 --> 31:20.566
N- Z-E-4-7-4-5.

31:20.633 --> 31:22.101
Did you ever think

31:22.102 --> 31:23.336
when you were up here making out

31:23.337 --> 31:25.138
with Mike Delvecchio

31:25.139 --> 31:26.373
that you would be changing

31:26.374 --> 31:27.307
diapers someday?

31:27.308 --> 31:29.208
God, no.

31:33.247 --> 31:34.647
What's going on,

31:34.648 --> 31:35.648
Carrie?

31:35.649 --> 31:36.882
CARRIE What do you

31:36.883 --> 31:39.852
mean?

31:39.919 --> 31:41.653
Downstairs...

31:41.654 --> 31:44.824
with the envelope- Mom looked

31:44.892 --> 31:46.893
like she was crying.

31:50.096 --> 31:53.097
Did something happen with Eddie?

31:55.834 --> 31:58.202
Um...

31:58.269 --> 31:59.837
I'm sure it's temporary.

31:59.838 --> 32:02.338
What's temporary?

32:02.406 --> 32:05.273
What did he do?

32:05.341 --> 32:07.142
Um...

32:07.143 --> 32:08.310
he... he left me three weeks

32:08.311 --> 32:09.377
ago, and I haven't heard from

32:09.378 --> 32:10.378
him since.

32:10.379 --> 32:11.579
Why didn't you tell

32:11.580 --> 32:12.580
me?

32:12.581 --> 32:13.581
'Cause I just, I

32:13.582 --> 32:14.816
didn't want to bother you, you

32:14.817 --> 32:15.750
know?

32:15.751 --> 32:17.018
You have... too much on your

32:17.019 --> 32:18.019
plate already.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.221
Don't be silly- let

32:19.222 --> 32:20.189
me help.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.090
Don't ask Mom for money.

32:22.158 --> 32:23.291
They can't afford it.

32:23.292 --> 32:24.357
How much do you need?

32:24.358 --> 32:25.657
No. You know what?

32:25.658 --> 32:26.624
Ellen, I can't.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.358
It is not a problem.

32:28.359 --> 32:31.358
Truly. I'll write you a check.

32:35.094 --> 32:36.994
Thank you.

32:38.729 --> 32:40.162
Are you gonna stay

32:40.163 --> 32:41.163
here?

32:41.164 --> 32:43.630
I mean... just till I

32:43.698 --> 32:45.598
get on my feet.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.067
Does Dad know?

32:49.068 --> 32:51.002
No.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.238
And he's going to freak out.

32:52.239 --> 32:53.305
You know he's going to blame me.

32:53.306 --> 32:54.339
I just... I can't take that

32:54.340 --> 32:55.340
right now, Ellen.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.507
I just don't... I don't want to

32:56.508 --> 32:58.142
be yelled at.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.944
I know, I know.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.645
But you're going to have to tell

33:01.646 --> 33:03.047
him soon.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.882
I was going to in the

33:04.883 --> 33:08.820
morning.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.855
Can you, um... can you stay?

33:10.923 --> 33:12.256
I just really don't want to do

33:12.257 --> 33:13.824
this alone.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.958
I really want to be

33:14.959 --> 33:15.959
there for you.

33:15.960 --> 33:16.959
I do. I...

33:16.960 --> 33:20.361
But I have to work.

33:20.429 --> 33:22.096
I know, you know

33:22.097 --> 33:24.098
what, I totally understand.

33:24.165 --> 33:26.166
It's okay.

33:36.842 --> 33:37.875
Do you know how

33:37.876 --> 33:40.945
long the flight will be?

33:41.012 --> 33:43.381
Uh, we can ask when we

33:43.448 --> 33:47.217
get there, okay?

33:47.285 --> 33:48.886
You look like your

33:48.887 --> 33:50.320
dad right now.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.389
Stop talking, please.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.361
How do I know you?

33:58.362 --> 34:03.198
Your voice sounds so familiar.

34:03.266 --> 34:06.069
Just rest, okay?

34:08.608 --> 34:09.609
So, what is it you

34:09.610 --> 34:14.149
want to talk about, Tom?

34:14.217 --> 34:18.081
You two look tense.

34:18.148 --> 34:19.281
Look, uh, there's no

34:19.282 --> 34:21.547
good way to say this.

34:21.616 --> 34:23.248
But I want to tell you before

34:23.250 --> 34:24.417
you got your next financial

34:24.418 --> 34:26.018
statements.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.152
Financial statements?

34:27.154 --> 34:29.188
What's this about?

34:33.391 --> 34:37.261
I, uh, screwed up.

34:41.299 --> 34:42.466
Jesus, one day in

34:42.467 --> 34:43.867
this house and your crap's in

34:43.868 --> 34:45.135
every single room!

34:45.136 --> 34:46.402
You and Eddie want to be slobs,

34:46.402 --> 34:48.603
fine, do it in your house, not

34:48.672 --> 34:49.670
mine!

34:49.672 --> 34:50.472
Gary, I don't think

34:50.473 --> 34:52.040
she's a slob.

34:52.041 --> 34:53.341
I said I'm sorry.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.175
I didn't even put this stuff

34:54.176 --> 34:55.208
here, Mom did.

34:55.210 --> 34:55.976
Oh, don't you blame

34:55.978 --> 34:56.710
your mother!

34:56.710 --> 34:58.545
Dad, stop it.

34:58.546 --> 35:02.282
I think she gets it.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.149
Are you ready to

35:03.150 --> 35:04.083
leave, honey?

35:04.084 --> 35:05.418
We can take you to the train.

35:05.419 --> 35:07.086
No, Ma, I think I'm

35:07.087 --> 35:08.821
gonna stay the night.

35:08.822 --> 35:10.688
Oh, well, how

35:10.689 --> 35:11.923
wonderful.

35:11.924 --> 35:13.123
Our two girls under the same

35:13.124 --> 35:14.124
roof.

35:14.125 --> 35:15.058
Fine with me.

35:15.059 --> 35:17.159
One less trip to the station.

35:17.227 --> 35:20.095
Gary, honey...

35:20.162 --> 35:22.563
It's gonna be okay.

35:27.835 --> 35:28.835
How far away are

35:28.836 --> 35:29.635
you?

35:29.636 --> 35:30.502
I'm ten minutes from the

35:30.503 --> 35:32.738
airport.

35:41.314 --> 35:43.148
We found her.

35:43.149 --> 35:44.550
She's on the way to the airport.

35:44.551 --> 35:46.051
We have a license plate number.

35:46.052 --> 35:47.018
I told you, Patty,

35:47.019 --> 35:47.786
we're not gonna detain her

35:47.787 --> 35:48.687
without cause.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.556
We have cause.

35:50.557 --> 35:52.125
What is it?

35:52.126 --> 35:52.959
He's driving with a

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
broken taillight.

36:02.835 --> 36:05.703
Shit.

36:19.045 --> 36:22.682
Shit.

36:22.683 --> 36:23.750
How are you?

36:23.751 --> 36:25.152
License and registration.

36:25.153 --> 36:26.387
Is there a problem?

36:26.388 --> 36:28.690
Your taillight's busted.

36:28.758 --> 36:31.227
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.067
What's wrong with her?

36:39.068 --> 36:40.201
She's, uh, she's ill.

36:40.202 --> 36:41.235
I was actually just taking her

36:41.236 --> 36:42.737
to the hospital.

36:42.738 --> 36:43.671
Really?

36:43.672 --> 36:45.304
'Cause the hospital's a mile

36:45.305 --> 36:46.272
back.

36:46.273 --> 36:47.640
You just passed it.

36:47.641 --> 36:48.474
Oh, really?

36:48.475 --> 36:51.109
Um...

36:51.177 --> 36:53.445
1-2-Alpha to HQ.

36:53.513 --> 36:56.613
I need rescue.

36:59.183 --> 36:59.849
(woman talking indistinctly

36:59.850 --> 37:01.851
over P.A.)

37:09.591 --> 37:13.393
She's not coming.

37:13.461 --> 37:15.195
I thought I'd get here to stop

37:15.196 --> 37:16.463
her myself, but it turns out I

37:16.464 --> 37:19.033
didn't have to.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.934
The police pulled her over.

37:20.935 --> 37:22.969
Actually, they pulled Joe Tobin

37:23.037 --> 37:24.670
over.

37:24.671 --> 37:25.971
Danielle Marchetti was

37:25.972 --> 37:29.976
unconscious in the backseat.

37:30.043 --> 37:31.044
Gee, that all

37:31.045 --> 37:34.279
sounds terrific, but I have no

37:34.347 --> 37:36.580
idea what you're talking about.

37:36.648 --> 37:38.681
It took me a while

37:38.749 --> 37:40.016
to find the airport she was

37:40.017 --> 37:42.117
flying out of, but I figured it

37:42.185 --> 37:44.052
out.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.319
And surprise, surprise, I find

37:45.320 --> 37:47.454
you here.

37:47.521 --> 37:48.454
Yeah, I'm off for

37:48.455 --> 37:51.824
a weekend in the Bahamas.

37:51.892 --> 37:55.326
Care to join?

37:55.393 --> 37:56.460
Danielle's in the

37:56.461 --> 37:57.928
hospital, in case you're

37:57.929 --> 38:00.730
wondering.

38:00.797 --> 38:03.465
What happened, Mr. Winstone?

38:03.533 --> 38:07.001
Joe told the police she fell?

38:07.069 --> 38:07.902
Patty, listen,

38:07.903 --> 38:08.736
before you issue the press

38:08.737 --> 38:09.570
release...

38:09.571 --> 38:10.405
There's no press

38:10.406 --> 38:11.239
release.

38:11.240 --> 38:12.507
There never was.

38:12.508 --> 38:14.877
Oh, I see.

38:14.945 --> 38:18.184
You had me followed.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.252
That's how you found the

38:19.253 --> 38:23.090
airport.

38:23.158 --> 38:24.724
I'm impressed.

38:24.725 --> 38:26.192
Tonight's been

38:26.193 --> 38:28.227
educational.

38:28.295 --> 38:29.695
I always knew the Tobins were

38:29.696 --> 38:31.563
hiding something.

38:31.564 --> 38:33.131
Now I know you're helping them

38:33.132 --> 38:36.501
do it.

38:36.569 --> 38:37.469
My colleague's already served

38:37.470 --> 38:39.270
Danielle with a subpoena.

38:39.271 --> 38:42.574
So, I got what I wanted.

38:42.642 --> 38:46.312
Good night, Mr. Winstone.

39:01.329 --> 39:05.500
Here's a check.

39:05.567 --> 39:07.835
Thanks, Ellie.

39:07.903 --> 39:09.203
There's a T-shirt and stuff

39:09.204 --> 39:10.238
upstairs if you want to borrow

39:10.239 --> 39:12.407
it.

39:48.810 --> 39:50.711
Find everything you need?

39:50.779 --> 39:52.780
Yeah.

39:54.216 --> 39:55.516
GARY Remember

39:55.517 --> 39:58.686
this?

40:04.860 --> 40:05.860
I do.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.161
Look at you two.

40:07.162 --> 40:09.166
Were we not adorable?

40:27.989 --> 40:31.025
I'll be right back.

40:41.829 --> 40:44.697
Hey, Patty, it's Ellen.

40:44.765 --> 40:46.765
I was just, uh, wondering-

40:46.833 --> 40:48.833
did you find that witness?

40:48.834 --> 40:54.206
