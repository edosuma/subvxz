00:31.992 --> 00:34.195
<i>Saurian attack fighters
have broken through the front lines.</i>

00:34.291 --> 00:37.795
- <i>We are in route to target...</i>
- <i>Evasive maneuvers!</i>

00:39.066 --> 00:42.490
<i>Initiate attack vector
at coordinates Six J Alpha 12.</i>

00:42.586 --> 00:44.027
<i>Affirmed.</i>

00:44.603 --> 00:46.751
<i>They're coming in too fast! I can't...</i>

00:47.643 --> 00:50.905
<i>Saurian target acquired. Squadron X, move in!</i>

00:52.442 --> 00:56.281
<i>Directly ahead, vector 1-1-3-8.</i>

01:02.456 --> 01:04.840
<i>Direct hit! Defensive aura holding.</i>

01:07.097 --> 01:09.849
- <i>It's on a collision course!</i>
- <i>Break formation!</i>

01:27.258 --> 01:28.819
<i>Target reacquired.</i>

01:39.993 --> 01:43.193
- <i>Senjo formation five.</i>
- Senjo five.

01:48.537 --> 01:52.025
Position locked. Nova, engage ion bridge.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.113
Engaged.

02:01.209 --> 02:02.929
<i>Okay, boys and girls...</i>

02:03.025 --> 02:06.954
...let's remind this Saurian viper how
the Terran empire deals with invaders.

02:07.050 --> 02:08.586
<i>Fire!</i>

02:10.616 --> 02:12.409
<i>Target locked!</i>

02:23.257 --> 02:26.906
We broke through the defensive aura.
Secondary engines severely damaged.

02:27.002 --> 02:30.105
<i>It's adrift. Stabilizers down.</i>

02:38.553 --> 02:40.282
Let's finish this.

02:40.378 --> 02:42.681
Target primary atomic engine.

02:44.170 --> 02:45.539
What?

02:51.450 --> 02:56.058
Terran Squadron commander, stand down.
That ship is protected.

02:56.442 --> 03:00.282
Unidentified vessel, do not interfere,
we are under orders.

03:00.378 --> 03:02.490
<i>I've just given you new orders.</i>

03:02.586 --> 03:06.074
And who are you to issue
orders to Squadron X?

03:06.170 --> 03:09.210
<i>Captain Saber Raine,
Terran special operations.</i>

03:09.306 --> 03:10.938
Captain Raine?

03:11.034 --> 03:15.642
I must inform you, you are interfering with
extermination orders from the rear admiral.

03:15.738 --> 03:18.715
And I'm telling you, Commander,
that order is wrong.

03:18.810 --> 03:21.178
<i>I will bring that ship and its captain in.</i>

03:21.274 --> 03:23.453
<i>You will stand down!</i>

03:35.513 --> 03:37.914
Its engines are coming back on line!

03:42.889 --> 03:44.592
It's breaking away, sir.

03:44.688 --> 03:48.921
Sorry, sir, no can do.
Squadron X, Senjo formation two.

03:49.017 --> 03:51.068
Senjo formation two.

03:55.688 --> 03:57.479
Bad move.

04:05.305 --> 04:07.826
<i>I'm under fire! Evasive maneuvers!</i>

04:10.745 --> 04:12.732
<i>Commander, your shields have been disrupted.</i>

04:13.114 --> 04:14.584
Stand down!

04:24.121 --> 04:26.554
<i>You just fired on your own forces.</i>

04:26.650 --> 04:28.460
<i>That is an act of treason!</i>

04:29.977 --> 04:31.705
Circe, open a channel.

04:32.921 --> 04:34.688
The channel's open, sir.

04:39.833 --> 04:42.882
<i>Captain, this is a direct order. Disengage!</i>

04:42.978 --> 04:45.195
I can't obey that order, sir.

04:46.010 --> 04:47.851
<i>This is your last chance, Saber.</i>

04:48.186 --> 04:50.298
That's a negative, sir!

04:50.538 --> 04:53.801
<i>Then you leave me no choice.
Commander Squadron X...</i>

04:55.049 --> 04:56.794
<i>...Terminate with extreme prejudice!</i>

04:56.890 --> 05:00.108
Affirmative. Squadron X, take him out!

05:00.473 --> 05:02.294
Always gotta be the hard way.

05:12.424 --> 05:14.650
<i>The system's core
has reached maximum capacity.</i>

05:14.746 --> 05:17.658
- They can't get through his shields.
- <i>Engine core levels at full power.</i>

05:17.753 --> 05:19.544
Plasma torpedo.

05:21.177 --> 05:24.410
- Plasma torpedo away.
- <i>Coordinates alpha six four seven.</i>

05:24.506 --> 05:26.489
<i>Initiate attack vector.</i>

05:31.337 --> 05:34.905
- He's headed straight at us!
- I can see that, thank you, Orion.

05:41.129 --> 05:45.001
- Open fire! All batteries!
- <i>Focus firepower toward the engine.</i>

05:46.458 --> 05:48.090
<i>All hands brace for impact.</i>

05:59.289 --> 06:01.914
<i>We're venting tri-plasma,
dispatch repair crews.</i>

06:02.010 --> 06:06.074
- He's launched a fusion mine!
- Evacuate the ship!

06:06.170 --> 06:10.840
All hands abandon ship!
I repeat, all hands abandon ship!

06:12.409 --> 06:14.168
Damn you, Saber.

08:45.589 --> 08:47.064
Sensors.

08:49.209 --> 08:51.130
No heat signature at all.

08:52.089 --> 08:53.817
Must be cold blooded.

08:55.064 --> 08:56.653
Control, what is this thing?

09:00.728 --> 09:02.648
<i>Scanning, sir.</i>

09:05.593 --> 09:09.242
<i>Unknown, sir, there is
no match in the database.</i>

09:09.625 --> 09:11.636
Switch to motion sensors.

09:54.617 --> 09:58.717
- Captain Raine.
- Saber, and don't salute me.

09:58.813 --> 10:01.146
I'm Commander Voss, I lead this operation.

10:01.242 --> 10:05.401
This is Ryll, my arms master,
and reconnaissance specialist Fade.

10:08.457 --> 10:10.248
We should get out of here.

10:16.889 --> 10:19.526
- What were those things?
- And why didn't they emit life signs?

10:19.622 --> 10:23.162
Mutates, and they didn't emit life signs
because they aren't alive.

10:23.258 --> 10:26.585
They're corpses animated
by some kind of larvae...

10:26.681 --> 10:29.402
...that feeds off the bodies of the dead.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.025
Part of the reason no one
comes to this planet.

10:32.121 --> 10:35.803
It's a consequence of what
happened here centuries ago.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.994
About that, there's no
data available, no records.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.313
Just a quarantine ordering all vessels
to stay clear of this sector.

10:44.409 --> 10:46.445
And this planet isn't on any known chart.

10:47.577 --> 10:50.519
It's a good thing you got
the coordinates I sent you.

10:52.249 --> 10:54.025
I'll tell you what I know.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.229
This world...

10:58.153 --> 11:00.409
...was once called Goros Prime.

11:00.505 --> 11:02.993
- Never heard of it.
- I have.

11:03.376 --> 11:06.136
A planet of legend,
ruled by a ruthless overlord.

11:06.617 --> 11:10.425
Stories I was told
it was merciless and sinister...

11:10.521 --> 11:12.501
...but ruthless will work.

11:13.209 --> 11:16.666
When they rediscovered
this planet, they quarantined it.

11:17.145 --> 11:19.258
But some have ignored the quarantine.

11:19.833 --> 11:24.858
They come here to conduct their...
business beyond prying eyes.

11:24.954 --> 11:27.865
- People like you.
- People way worse than me.

11:27.961 --> 11:30.136
Renegades, smugglers.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.402
Your enormous bounty got me here.

11:33.785 --> 11:35.962
But your transmission...

11:36.058 --> 11:39.737
...neglected to give me the specifics
on what we're after exactly.

11:40.377 --> 11:43.802
We could not transmit that information
for fear it would be intercepted.

11:46.264 --> 11:48.237
I don't think anyone's listening.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.969
Members of the Aresian
royal family were taken.

11:51.065 --> 11:53.018
The prince and princess.

11:53.114 --> 11:55.194
The king's only heirs.

11:55.290 --> 11:58.010
They also took a single piece
of treasure from the king's vault.

11:58.106 --> 12:01.594
Whoever abducted them, managed
to leave the planet undetected.

12:01.690 --> 12:03.043
Tell me about the treasure.

12:03.139 --> 12:07.706
A single jewel, a relic acquired centuries
ago on a xenoarcheological dig...

12:07.802 --> 12:09.753
...on the planet Phobos.

12:09.849 --> 12:11.417
Valuable?

12:11.513 --> 12:15.354
Insignificant, an information storage device.

12:15.450 --> 12:18.842
He's more concerned with the treasure
than with the lives of our people.

12:18.938 --> 12:22.170
I'm surprised your planet
only dispatched the three of you.

12:22.266 --> 12:25.036
We alone were responsible
for their protection.

12:25.132 --> 12:28.601
Our code of honor dictates
that we must find those responsible.

12:28.697 --> 12:30.585
And kill them.

12:30.681 --> 12:32.248
Discretely.

12:34.073 --> 12:37.146
If the king dies before we
return with his children...

12:37.722 --> 12:40.414
...we will be honor bound
to join him in the afterlife.

12:44.345 --> 12:46.136
I have a...

12:46.232 --> 12:47.736
...friend.

12:48.664 --> 12:51.929
If it's happening on Goros,
he'll know about it.

13:07.945 --> 13:09.833
I trust you are comfortable.

13:09.929 --> 13:13.241
My comfort is irrelevant.
Where is my brother?

13:18.490 --> 13:21.393
He has been enjoying my hospitality.

13:21.978 --> 13:24.176
You will tell me what I want to know...

13:24.272 --> 13:28.123
...and with that knowledge
I will conquer the universe.

13:30.617 --> 13:32.537
I'll tell you a secret.

13:33.561 --> 13:37.388
We may be royalty, but we are still warriors.

13:48.313 --> 13:50.201
Our father will not stop searching for us.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.906
But he won't find you, no one will.

13:53.529 --> 13:57.336
- Who are you?
- I am Sinjin!

13:57.432 --> 14:00.518
But you, along with all living creatures...

14:00.614 --> 14:03.176
...need only call me Master!

14:03.992 --> 14:05.468
Warriors?

14:07.801 --> 14:09.496
Pathetic!

14:22.232 --> 14:24.890
- You got a problem?
- I don't trust you.

14:25.177 --> 14:27.560
- You don't know me.
- Really?

14:28.568 --> 14:32.682
Control, information on an individual
known as Saber Raine.

14:32.778 --> 14:35.150
<i>Saber Raine, origin...</i>

14:35.246 --> 14:37.747
<i>...Earth 2762.</i>

14:38.264 --> 14:40.793
<i>Decorated officer in the Cyber-Corps.</i>

14:40.889 --> 14:44.409
<i>Given command of his own unit in 2784.</i>

14:44.505 --> 14:47.801
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- <i>2790.</i>

14:47.897 --> 14:51.930
<i>Records indicate his entire team was lost
during the Saurian invasion on Mars.</i>

14:52.026 --> 14:54.042
<i>Saber Raine was the sole survivor.</i>

14:54.137 --> 14:57.337
<i>Subject was sent into deep cover
to gain intelligence on the Saurians.</i>

14:57.433 --> 15:00.762
<i>Weeks into his mission
subject disappeared, believed dead.</i>

15:00.857 --> 15:03.350
But you didn't perish, did you?

15:03.609 --> 15:05.978
<i>Resurfaced in 2792...</i>

15:06.074 --> 15:09.465
<i>...just as a massive Terran force
was assaulting the Saurian homeworld.</i>

15:09.561 --> 15:12.921
<i>Subject sided with the enemy.
Labeled a traitor.</i>

15:13.017 --> 15:14.809
Thank you, Control.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.755
Ryll, this is accomplishing nothing.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.521
He's a mercenary.

15:22.648 --> 15:24.092
Unworthy.

15:25.003 --> 15:27.609
I don't need you to tell me about my past.

15:27.705 --> 15:29.495
I lived it.

15:30.136 --> 15:33.838
We're here now. You need my help,
and I need to know you got my back.

15:35.641 --> 15:39.321
Or are your personal feelings more important
than those lives you swore to protect?

15:39.417 --> 15:43.993
Your weapons, they fire projectiles
propelled by exploding gas.

15:44.089 --> 15:46.361
Bullets, T-2 explosives. Saved your ass!

15:46.457 --> 15:49.082
Primitive and inferior!

15:49.178 --> 15:51.898
Can we stop trying to compare
the size of our guns...

15:52.377 --> 15:54.329
...and go find your people.

15:59.672 --> 16:01.257
It's just over that ridge.

16:04.985 --> 16:08.469
Keep your red eye open,
we're in annelid territory.

16:09.113 --> 16:11.836
- What's an annelid?
- You don't want to know!

16:37.017 --> 16:38.775
After you.

16:52.568 --> 16:54.087
Hold it right there.

16:54.969 --> 16:56.728
Bad move.

17:00.473 --> 17:03.705
On this planet, you always have backup.

17:10.008 --> 17:11.896
Saber Raine.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.167
In the flesh.

17:19.223 --> 17:21.625
I'm surprised to see you...

17:21.721 --> 17:23.050
...alive.

17:23.672 --> 17:25.175
Hello.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.520
What have we here?

17:32.120 --> 17:33.720
Aresians.

17:34.648 --> 17:36.825
Traveling in some elite circles, I see.

17:37.209 --> 17:40.005
Yeah, we're old pals.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.753
That's good, cause you
haven't got many 'round here.

17:46.616 --> 17:49.881
We're looking for some friends.
I thought maybe you could help.

17:49.976 --> 17:51.475
This a bounty?

17:51.570 --> 17:55.194
'Cause if I gotta betray one
of my friends, it's gonna cost more.

17:55.290 --> 17:57.081
Visitors. They're...

17:57.177 --> 17:59.321
Brought against their will.

17:59.993 --> 18:04.060
Slavers, maybe. There's been
an increase in traffic lately.

18:04.825 --> 18:06.745
A Denarian you might remember.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.919
Lorthos?

18:11.192 --> 18:13.798
Known in this part of the galaxy
as the slave master.

18:13.894 --> 18:15.895
Lorthos is a thug!

18:16.569 --> 18:21.016
Preys on unarmed vessels
and isolated encampments.

18:21.976 --> 18:25.464
- We're trying to find...
- Find other Aresians.

18:26.872 --> 18:30.041
And we'd appreciate
any information you can provide.

18:37.912 --> 18:40.986
Pretty. But you'll have to sweeten the pot.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.871
Say...

18:43.352 --> 18:45.275
...one power cylinder.

18:46.104 --> 18:49.337
I've heard many tales in my line of work...

18:49.817 --> 18:52.601
...and the stories
of the Aresian power cylinder...

18:52.697 --> 18:55.135
...have always intrigued me.

18:59.288 --> 19:01.080
Just stories.

19:03.224 --> 19:05.177
Then I'm afraid I can't help you.

19:15.224 --> 19:17.202
You better know something.

19:31.192 --> 19:32.877
I think...

19:32.973 --> 19:34.808
...your friends...

19:34.904 --> 19:36.856
...are now my friends.

19:39.704 --> 19:41.944
I don't know anything about any captives.

19:45.049 --> 19:47.032
Always have backup.

19:48.312 --> 19:52.570
But there has been a lot of activity
in the great ruins lately.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.578
Ships seen flying in that direction.

19:56.345 --> 20:00.236
Annelids being slaughtered in the surrounding
out lands by organized forces.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.330
Why is that important?

20:02.905 --> 20:07.033
There's a lot of strange creatures on Goros.
Different warring factions.

20:07.129 --> 20:11.609
They all have one thing in common.
They all stay clear of the ruins.

20:11.705 --> 20:12.617
Why?

20:12.713 --> 20:16.174
'Cause anything that goes in there,
doesn't usually come out.

20:16.793 --> 20:18.775
With a few exceptions.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.945
I haven't actually been
to the ruins per se...

20:22.041 --> 20:24.729
...but I've seen them from a distance.

20:25.209 --> 20:27.090
It's the perfect place
to keep someone prisoner.

20:27.186 --> 20:29.349
Then that's our destination.

20:30.456 --> 20:32.634
It's not safe to travel at night.

20:33.209 --> 20:35.385
You can stay here till morning.

20:35.481 --> 20:38.935
I think we'll stick to the schedule.
Thanks, Jax.

20:40.408 --> 20:41.759
I'm sorry about your...

20:44.249 --> 20:45.434
...rock guy.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.440
It's okay. I have more in the mines.

20:50.455 --> 20:52.422
If you survive this...

20:52.967 --> 20:54.759
...I expect intel.

20:55.704 --> 20:57.496
It'll cost ya.

20:57.944 --> 20:59.687
Let's go.

21:04.759 --> 21:06.827
Take it easy, Jax.

21:24.632 --> 21:26.359
She's gone.

21:27.256 --> 21:28.761
Easy.

21:29.241 --> 21:32.185
Name's Kor'ock, I'm a transport pilot.

21:32.808 --> 21:35.673
Where are we? What planet?

21:35.769 --> 21:38.681
What planet? Goros Prime.

21:39.448 --> 21:41.354
What do you know of our captors?

21:41.449 --> 21:42.918
Not much.

21:43.014 --> 21:46.521
I was flying near the outland mires,
my ship lost power, crash landed.

21:46.617 --> 21:49.439
Had four on board, only two survived.

21:49.535 --> 21:51.513
Where are the other survivors?

21:51.609 --> 21:55.096
I don't know, we were separated. And you?

21:56.599 --> 21:58.103
Unclear.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.556
My sister and I were on Ares...

22:01.113 --> 22:02.903
...our homeworld.

22:03.223 --> 22:05.177
And then we woke up here.

22:05.273 --> 22:06.720
Prisoners.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.127
You look strangely calm!

22:20.695 --> 22:23.274
Universe has a plan for everyone, kid.

22:25.528 --> 22:28.099
I'm just waiting to see
what it has planned for me.

22:40.248 --> 22:43.581
The power cylinder,
it's a mana stone, isn't it?

22:49.144 --> 22:51.738
And you're not concerned
with giving one to Jax?

22:53.033 --> 22:54.824
A necessary action.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.561
Our mission is paramount.

22:57.657 --> 23:01.112
Besides, it's a very unstable substance.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.506
Are you saying my friend
could blow himself up?

23:15.064 --> 23:18.008
- Now let me ask you something.
- Alright.

23:18.651 --> 23:20.682
Tell me why you betrayed your people.

23:21.977 --> 23:25.306
- Excuse me?
- You seem like a man of honor.

23:26.073 --> 23:29.433
So there must be a reason
why you assisted the Saurians.

23:29.528 --> 23:31.292
One Saurian.

23:31.639 --> 23:33.143
Crotalus.

23:34.488 --> 23:36.633
I had to act or she would have died.

23:36.729 --> 23:39.033
I couldn't have that on my conscience.

23:40.664 --> 23:42.965
Crotalus gave me information that...

23:43.060 --> 23:46.170
...let our forces penetrate
their defenses on Erobus Two.

23:47.225 --> 23:49.336
She's the reason we won the war.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.053
My government...

23:53.149 --> 23:56.504
...didn't want the rest of the galaxy to
know that we couldn't do it on our own...

23:58.776 --> 24:00.920
...so they wanted her silenced.

24:02.744 --> 24:05.078
And you turned on your own to protect her.

24:05.689 --> 24:07.640
Wrong is wrong, Fade.

24:08.504 --> 24:10.487
She was a hero.

24:14.968 --> 24:16.856
We've rested long enough.

24:18.264 --> 24:20.389
Control, we're on the move.

24:22.776 --> 24:25.528
Control? Respond.

24:26.648 --> 24:28.569
We must've entered the mire.

24:28.952 --> 24:31.353
Your power sources won't work here.

24:32.072 --> 24:35.686
Guess my gas propelled projectiles
don't look so bad now, do they?

24:42.200 --> 24:43.576
Just saying.

24:45.336 --> 24:47.288
You knew this would happen?

24:47.384 --> 24:50.263
This area is strange on tech.

24:50.808 --> 24:55.499
That's why I gave you the coordinates I did.
Ship coming down here, it'd be bad.

24:56.216 --> 24:58.554
But it's the only way to the ruins.

25:19.781 --> 25:23.161
Our ships are prepared. Why must we wait?

25:23.257 --> 25:27.159
So you find my hospitality...

25:28.119 --> 25:29.796
...is inadequate?

25:29.892 --> 25:33.879
I find my thirst for revenge unquenched.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.625
The generator is nearly complete...

25:37.720 --> 25:41.368
...but the power source remains unstable.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.326
The equation must be precise.

25:53.271 --> 25:57.272
He says, you should let
his hive interrogate the prisoners.

25:57.368 --> 26:00.474
They will succeed where you have failed.

26:01.241 --> 26:04.183
And if he were to perish?

26:04.504 --> 26:06.123
No...

26:06.219 --> 26:09.714
...by the time the generator
is operational...

26:09.810 --> 26:12.665
...I will have what I need from him.

26:12.761 --> 26:17.374
And your ships will have the power...

26:17.470 --> 26:19.526
...to unleash my wrath...

26:19.862 --> 26:22.181
...across the universe!

26:22.276 --> 26:24.101
We are an alliance.

26:24.888 --> 26:27.192
We do not serve you!

26:27.528 --> 26:30.249
I have cleared a path through the mires...

26:30.345 --> 26:34.375
...provided you with subjects to modify.

26:35.159 --> 26:37.688
You boast of a once great empire.

26:37.784 --> 26:40.647
So far I am unimpressed!

26:41.560 --> 26:43.672
He is correct.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.457
You may have initiated this alliance...

26:46.553 --> 26:49.753
...but we have provided
all the raw materials...

26:49.849 --> 26:51.262
...and the technology.

26:51.358 --> 26:53.879
And the technology.

26:55.416 --> 26:58.888
You have such little minds.

26:58.984 --> 27:02.009
Each of your races have been defeated...

27:02.104 --> 27:05.194
...by those you attempted to conquer.

27:05.289 --> 27:07.259
What I offer...

27:08.045 --> 27:10.780
...is beyond your comprehension.

27:14.808 --> 27:16.599
An unbeliever.

27:17.207 --> 27:20.343
A demonstration is required.

27:32.823 --> 27:37.814
It is difficult to kill that
which does not truly live.

27:41.912 --> 27:45.913
My construct is not powered by science.

27:46.455 --> 27:48.823
It's powered by the mind.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.827
Alive because...

27:51.923 --> 27:55.026
...I will it into existence!

27:55.506 --> 27:58.361
So you would kill me as a show of your power?

27:58.457 --> 28:00.825
No, killing you would be pointless.

28:00.920 --> 28:05.814
Return to your vessels,
and continue your preparations.

28:06.103 --> 28:08.471
Go! Go!

28:22.839 --> 28:25.208
<i>Commander Voss, please respond.</i>

28:25.304 --> 28:28.024
<i>Scheduled check in time has elapsed.</i>

28:30.167 --> 28:33.112
<i>Recovery protocol one initiating.</i>

30:38.455 --> 30:42.078
- Who are... who are you?
- We're the cavalry.

30:43.671 --> 30:47.994
My legs, they're going numb.
I think it was some sort of toxin.

30:49.241 --> 30:52.184
We did not need to engage
these creatures at close range.

30:52.280 --> 30:54.649
You could've dispatched them from a distance!

30:54.745 --> 30:58.515
The noise would've brought more.
We're lucky this was a small band.

30:58.610 --> 31:00.583
We need to move out.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.607
Commander!

31:16.247 --> 31:17.736
Father.

31:21.832 --> 31:25.000
You must finish the mission. Find the heirs!

31:25.096 --> 31:27.085
We'll find them together.

31:30.424 --> 31:31.927
No.

31:38.231 --> 31:41.175
Fade, we have to go.

31:41.944 --> 31:43.446
Fade.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.710
Now.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.735
We make our stand here.

32:34.136 --> 32:36.280
Always gotta be the hard way.

32:57.047 --> 32:58.807
Always have backup.

33:06.807 --> 33:08.100
Caliope!

33:10.872 --> 33:14.061
- I was strong.
- I know you were.

33:15.639 --> 33:18.326
It's okay, he's a friend.

33:19.204 --> 33:21.143
We have no friends here.

33:22.488 --> 33:25.591
Alright. I'll leave you two alone.

33:28.119 --> 33:31.994
I'm sorry, they're doing this
to you to get to me.

33:32.857 --> 33:35.784
No matter what they do,
you cannot give them what they seek.

33:38.104 --> 33:41.145
We will find a way out of here,
and get back home.

33:41.432 --> 33:44.664
And we will return to this planet
with a vengeance.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.448
Tyr...

33:46.544 --> 33:49.461
...you were the only one Father entrusted
the secret to before his illness...

33:49.556 --> 33:52.175
...you must get back home!
You must lead our people.

33:52.271 --> 33:54.623
I can't let them put
their hands on you again.

33:54.719 --> 33:56.471
I don't matter!

33:58.039 --> 34:02.285
- You've always been so strong.
- We must fight to protect what is ours.

34:03.928 --> 34:07.576
I know Father never said it,
but he is proud of you.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.217
Your passion for xeno archeology...

34:12.313 --> 34:15.672
...your drive to understanding
a greater universe.

34:15.768 --> 34:17.944
A mind like yours cannot be lost.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.766
You do matter.

34:24.918 --> 34:29.431
I will give them what they want.
In return for your safe passage back to Ares.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.599
- You will lead in my stead.
- Tyr, no.

34:33.056 --> 34:36.536
I will give you the same honor
Father bestowed upon me.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.551
The frequency that causes the mana stone
to release controlled energy.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.312
This is madness, there must be another way.

34:44.408 --> 34:47.704
Even if they have it, they would
have to acquire raw material...

34:47.800 --> 34:49.800
...build a refinement facility.

34:50.887 --> 34:52.827
It would take a great deal of time.

34:53.976 --> 34:57.848
More than enough time for you to bring
back our forces, and eliminate the threat.

34:57.944 --> 35:00.855
Either way, you would surely die.

35:02.583 --> 35:06.841
Knowing that you'll live.
Caliope, please, as you said...

35:06.937 --> 35:09.272
...we must protect what is ours.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.970
You know.

35:11.066 --> 35:12.983
That's a pretty good plan.

35:14.359 --> 35:16.151
Just might work.

35:19.416 --> 35:21.779
How do you know he would honor your request?

35:22.297 --> 35:24.152
We will have a code word...

35:24.248 --> 35:26.732
...a word that you will give
to those that return you to safety.

35:26.828 --> 35:29.272
Once that word has been relayed back to me...

35:29.368 --> 35:31.735
...I will reveal the information to Sinjin.

35:34.455 --> 35:35.958
Good.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.035
I'm sorry, my friend.

35:46.135 --> 35:48.119
Now, look kid!

35:52.007 --> 35:54.561
What I say now is for my sister's ears only.

36:06.615 --> 36:09.903
<i>Recovery drones offline.</i>

36:14.231 --> 36:15.863
Easy.

36:15.959 --> 36:17.592
You've been poisoned.

36:17.688 --> 36:21.528
I've applied a remedy to the wound,
you must give it time to work.

36:26.263 --> 36:27.799
Good morning.

36:29.591 --> 36:31.735
I see you've met my friend.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.199
This is Crotalus.

36:40.183 --> 36:43.883
Have no fear.
I've dispatched their priestess.

36:46.776 --> 36:49.686
They won't be returning any time soon.

36:50.568 --> 36:52.326
My father?

36:54.487 --> 36:56.246
I'm sorry.

37:01.368 --> 37:03.351
He died as he lived.

37:04.695 --> 37:06.454
With honor.

37:12.311 --> 37:14.071
His body?

37:21.207 --> 37:23.032
We must build a pyre.

37:23.128 --> 37:26.455
I'm not certain that that's a wise choice.

37:33.847 --> 37:36.555
I fail to see how igniting a blaze...

37:36.651 --> 37:40.696
...will assist us in remaining
undetected in dangerous territory.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.905
I hope you brought some more ammo.

37:44.056 --> 37:45.805
It's always gotta be the hard way.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.319
She stays here.

38:21.239 --> 38:23.223
I will offer my terms.

38:41.239 --> 38:44.183
Be wary, he's not to be trusted.

39:01.559 --> 39:03.671
Yes, investigate.

39:23.255 --> 39:25.383
Your sister's freedom...

39:26.044 --> 39:28.586
...for the information I seek.

39:29.703 --> 39:32.263
I will consider your offer.

39:33.303 --> 39:38.438
But before I decide,
do you have any idea who I am?

39:38.999 --> 39:41.656
One of the many would be
conquerors of the universe...

39:41.752 --> 39:44.825
...who seeks to steal the secrets
of the mana stone.

39:46.168 --> 39:50.487
The way your race has used technology...

39:50.583 --> 39:54.070
...to unleash its power is impressive.

39:55.542 --> 39:58.040
What do you know of the mana stone?

39:58.232 --> 40:00.374
What do I know?

40:01.463 --> 40:05.718
I know it did not originate on your planet.

40:07.143 --> 40:11.813
I know it was stolen in battle centuries ago!

40:12.215 --> 40:14.312
And horded it to build your own empire.

40:14.408 --> 40:15.896
And how do you know this?

40:15.992 --> 40:18.934
Because I was there!

40:28.374 --> 40:30.935
Your race originated here...

40:31.799 --> 40:33.591
...on Goros.

40:33.687 --> 40:36.056
Impossible! Our home is Ares...

40:36.152 --> 40:38.551
Ares, is not your world.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.933
Your ancestors took refuge there...

40:41.029 --> 40:45.337
...after the greatest galactic war
the universe has ever seen.

40:45.816 --> 40:48.694
You are children of Goros.

40:49.335 --> 40:52.588
- I don't believe you.
- Yes, you do.

40:53.367 --> 40:57.751
When your ancestors allied themselves
with my ancient enemy...

40:57.847 --> 41:01.334
...the ensuing battle decimated this planet.

41:02.615 --> 41:04.440
Only through my power...

41:04.536 --> 41:08.631
...I was able to protect
a small piece of Goros.

41:12.375 --> 41:15.544
At the moment of my greatest glory...

41:15.639 --> 41:19.044
- ...I was betrayed from within.
- You're mad.

41:19.140 --> 41:21.847
I only want what's destined to be mine!

41:24.935 --> 41:27.816
A grand story that has illuminated me.

41:28.344 --> 41:30.840
Now I know I can never reveal what I know.

41:31.224 --> 41:33.175
No matter the cost!

41:37.847 --> 41:39.800
You don't have to.

41:39.896 --> 41:42.617
Your secret is already mine.

41:45.607 --> 41:47.060
Caliope?

41:47.575 --> 41:49.107
No.

41:49.683 --> 41:51.640
This is how it is supposed to be.

41:51.736 --> 41:53.400
But our world.

41:53.496 --> 41:54.998
Our family!

41:55.094 --> 41:56.919
Don't you understand?

41:57.015 --> 42:00.888
Sinjin is our family. Our oldest ancestor.

42:01.176 --> 42:04.056
You can't believe
what this creature is telling you!

42:07.351 --> 42:11.448
A history gem I discovered
in the vaults on Ares.

42:11.544 --> 42:13.718
Proof of our lineage.

42:15.927 --> 42:19.256
<i>From the gem I learned
the location of this planet.</i>

42:19.880 --> 42:23.000
<i>I discovered the remnants
of that ancient battle.</i>

42:27.607 --> 42:30.392
<i>As if pulled by some unknown force...</i>

42:30.488 --> 42:32.982
<i>...I was drawn to a hidden chamber.</i>

42:37.495 --> 42:40.758
<i>Sinjin was still alive in Cryostasis.</i>

42:41.303 --> 42:43.865
<i>I knew it was my destiny to revive him.</i>

42:45.208 --> 42:47.320
It's all a lie, Tyr.

42:47.416 --> 42:51.342
Our history on Ares has been
manufactured to conceal our past.

42:51.927 --> 42:54.232
A past where we turned on our own.

42:54.711 --> 42:56.855
A past I will see corrected.

42:58.647 --> 43:01.383
The generator has already been constructed.

43:03.351 --> 43:06.294
A supply of refined mana stone provided.

43:11.478 --> 43:15.672
Sinjin controls the power
of the mana stone with telepathy.

43:15.768 --> 43:18.007
We manipulate it with technology.

43:18.103 --> 43:22.135
Together, we will establish
a new power in the universe.

43:25.238 --> 43:27.182
Now you have a choice to make.

43:29.078 --> 43:32.952
- There is no choice.
- There's always a choice, brother.

43:33.719 --> 43:35.640
I was hoping you'd understand.

43:36.311 --> 43:37.782
Understand?

43:38.262 --> 43:42.221
You had us brought here. Allied yourself
with an abomination from our past!

43:42.317 --> 43:45.765
You tricked me into revealing
the resonance frequency...

43:45.861 --> 43:49.912
- ...and you have a delusion of conquest?
- It's not a delusion if you can do it!

43:50.008 --> 43:53.527
- This isn't like you!
- This is me!

43:53.623 --> 43:57.000
In studying the universe,
there is one constant.

43:57.096 --> 44:01.623
War. At any given moment, there are
dozens of planets engaged in battle.

44:01.719 --> 44:03.864
Empires rise and fall.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.423
And you believe such chaos can be controlled?

44:06.519 --> 44:10.552
Yes. The universe needs to be cleansed.

44:10.648 --> 44:14.136
- Re-shaped.
- Now I understand.

44:14.520 --> 44:18.743
You were the oldest, yet Father
chose to pass his mantel on to me.

44:18.839 --> 44:21.015
He must've recognized what I did not.

44:21.111 --> 44:22.870
You are unworthy!

44:25.079 --> 44:29.432
Regardless of what happens to me,
Ares will stand against you!

44:29.719 --> 44:32.043
Ares will not see this coming!

44:33.494 --> 44:35.608
Soon I will return home...

44:36.135 --> 44:38.663
...devastated by the loss of my brother.

44:40.151 --> 44:43.662
Soon after Father will die,
and I will assume the throne.

44:44.296 --> 44:48.888
Ares and Goros will reunite
and history will once again be rewritten.

44:48.984 --> 44:50.968
You are demented, sister!

44:51.064 --> 44:53.827
No, no, my friend.

44:54.135 --> 44:58.038
She is a woman about to become a goddess.

44:59.799 --> 45:03.638
And you will live to see my ascension.

45:11.863 --> 45:15.095
I'm Fade. I didn't get a chance to thank you.

45:15.191 --> 45:17.052
You saved us all.

45:17.148 --> 45:22.166
It wasn't too difficult.
I have some experience with toxins.

45:24.503 --> 45:27.358
I apologize for Fade's emotional outburst.

45:27.454 --> 45:28.935
What?

45:29.031 --> 45:33.109
No, not at all, she... she lost her father.

45:34.038 --> 45:35.894
And I lost a brother.

45:37.047 --> 45:38.838
I had no idea.

45:39.222 --> 45:41.803
All Aresian families serve together.

45:42.648 --> 45:45.368
It assures the highest level of loyalty.

45:45.943 --> 45:47.319
You were tracking us?

45:47.415 --> 45:50.711
Following, at Saber's request.

45:50.807 --> 45:55.667
He has rather a large bounty on him
that many find hard to resist.

45:55.763 --> 45:57.526
He's very careful.

46:03.767 --> 46:05.270
So...

46:05.495 --> 46:07.222
...you and Saber?

46:09.175 --> 46:12.919
No, no. He's attractive on the inside.

46:13.015 --> 46:15.925
But we're incompatible.

46:20.726 --> 46:22.229
There.

46:23.063 --> 46:24.791
The ruins.

46:31.063 --> 46:33.368
My weapon's power has been restored.

46:36.599 --> 46:38.070
Control?

46:40.214 --> 46:42.264
It's active but there's no signal.

46:42.359 --> 46:44.727
Yeah, we must be in they eye of the mire.

46:45.111 --> 46:49.686
Something tells me we're about to walk
into something much more dangerous.

46:56.759 --> 46:58.517
Oh, hell no.

47:25.142 --> 47:28.214
Hey, guys, can we talk about this?

48:31.638 --> 48:33.821
Did you get a look at those things?

48:35.287 --> 48:38.005
Organized. Soldiers.

48:38.902 --> 48:42.039
They're protecting something. A good sign.

48:42.135 --> 48:45.238
If you say so. Let's introduce ourselves!

49:02.583 --> 49:04.971
The generator is fully operational.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.831
Our ships are being connected as we speak.

49:08.599 --> 49:12.246
In a matter of hours your ships
will know the power of Aresian...

49:13.638 --> 49:15.431
...of Gorosian technology.

49:18.615 --> 49:20.183
What is it?

49:20.279 --> 49:22.070
What is wrong?

49:30.727 --> 49:32.424
We have visitors.

49:33.048 --> 49:35.159
Who? Where?

49:35.255 --> 49:36.727
Nearby.

49:36.823 --> 49:40.693
As for who, crimson eyes.

49:41.079 --> 49:43.032
I think they are your brethren.

49:43.320 --> 49:44.982
How many?

49:46.070 --> 49:49.625
I saw three before my Skelion
guards were dispatched.

49:50.775 --> 49:52.535
Caveliers most likely.

49:53.979 --> 49:55.800
Only three?

49:55.896 --> 49:59.408
Caveliers are very resourceful.
Likely to have a battle cruiser.

49:59.504 --> 50:02.712
Heavily armored and powered
by mana stone technology.

50:02.807 --> 50:04.536
We lack sufficient forces.

50:04.632 --> 50:07.734
If they find us, others will follow.

50:08.662 --> 50:11.994
Take a few Quintari pilots,
patrol the skies...

50:12.090 --> 50:15.479
...while the remaining ships
stay connected to the generator.

50:15.575 --> 50:17.112
But what of the mire?

50:17.207 --> 50:20.695
The mire is a defense field of my creation.

50:21.175 --> 50:23.734
It can be deactivated.

50:24.695 --> 50:26.760
We will intercept them on the ground.

50:26.855 --> 50:29.686
They cannot leave here alive!

50:34.550 --> 50:39.965
Some type of central control system
linked directly to the recipient's brain.

50:40.061 --> 50:41.619
Barbaric.

50:44.102 --> 50:45.831
Was it actually alive?

50:48.118 --> 50:49.783
At some point it was.

50:49.879 --> 50:53.155
And based on its organic state,
it wasn't that long ago.

50:53.527 --> 50:56.120
But now it's just a mindless thrall.

50:56.215 --> 51:00.696
If that's the case, then someone
or something was controlling it.

51:01.463 --> 51:04.216
Which means it's likely
we have been detected.

51:04.695 --> 51:06.871
So much for the element of surprise.

51:10.230 --> 51:12.021
Say it.

51:13.590 --> 51:15.382
Say what?

51:19.254 --> 51:21.074
It's always gotta be the hard way.

51:22.407 --> 51:24.582
Now we can proceed.

51:34.613 --> 51:36.342
Don't touch me!

51:37.783 --> 51:39.445
Why, you!

51:51.798 --> 51:53.368
What did they do to you?

51:53.463 --> 51:55.702
I think I know what happened
to the rest of my crew.

51:56.342 --> 51:59.063
It's synthetic, but I can feel it.

51:59.159 --> 52:00.789
We have to get out of here.

52:02.198 --> 52:05.462
Yeah, about that, I brought you a present.

52:11.926 --> 52:13.655
Can you travel?

52:14.135 --> 52:16.855
I'd like to, but I don't think so.

52:17.719 --> 52:21.366
- You have to save your sister.
- I'm not sure that's possible.

52:52.950 --> 52:54.742
I'm sorry, my friend.

53:21.882 --> 53:26.255
We are airborne and remain
on the perimeter, awaiting your command.

53:34.198 --> 53:36.214
The mire is down.

53:39.862 --> 53:42.231
<i>Drone communication re-established.</i>

53:42.327 --> 53:44.585
<i>Recovery protocols re-engaged.</i>

53:53.398 --> 53:55.607
<i>Commander Voss, offline.</i>

53:55.703 --> 53:58.071
<i>Lieutenant Ryll, please respond.</i>

53:58.551 --> 54:01.953
<i>Repeat. Lieutenant Ryll, report.</i>

54:02.049 --> 54:03.830
Hold on.

54:04.726 --> 54:06.198
Control.

54:06.294 --> 54:09.685
<i>Affirmative, sir. What is your situation?</i>

54:10.133 --> 54:11.943
Commander Voss is dead.

54:12.375 --> 54:14.295
<i>Understood, Commander.</i>

54:14.391 --> 54:17.554
<i>Recovery drones en route. ETA 10.</i>

54:17.650 --> 54:19.269
Very good.

54:19.365 --> 54:22.479
Bring them in low.
We're approaching target area...

54:22.575 --> 54:25.367
...and drones will only serve
to alert them to our position.

54:25.463 --> 54:28.042
<i>Understood. Flying in low.</i>

54:30.198 --> 54:32.058
They may already know our position.

54:33.367 --> 54:35.286
Approaching from directly ahead.

54:38.102 --> 54:39.893
Where's Saber?

54:43.478 --> 54:45.672
Perhaps we should follow his lead.

54:47.318 --> 54:49.045
We move forward.

55:00.726 --> 55:03.220
- Princess!
- Release her!

55:04.310 --> 55:06.167
I am not a prisoner, Ryll.

55:06.263 --> 55:08.117
These are friends.

55:09.653 --> 55:11.511
I'm here on a secret mission.

55:11.607 --> 55:13.441
A mission you can now assist me with.

55:13.536 --> 55:15.864
Something's not right, Princess.

55:16.919 --> 55:19.864
Those who stand beside you
are friends to no one.

55:20.919 --> 55:23.014
Where is Prince Tyr?

55:27.670 --> 55:29.481
The prince is dead.

55:30.326 --> 55:32.855
And you have sworn loyalty to the crown.

55:32.951 --> 55:34.662
To me.

55:34.758 --> 55:38.261
I'm ordering you to put your weapons
on the ground and stand down.

55:43.190 --> 55:46.072
- What are you doing?
- They're doing their duty.

55:47.271 --> 55:49.030
What have we here?

55:51.510 --> 55:53.270
A Saurian.

55:54.038 --> 55:57.189
It seems I'm not the only one
traveling with unlikely allies.

55:58.231 --> 56:00.151
Please do not interfere.

56:00.438 --> 56:02.398
Your voice is kind...

56:03.149 --> 56:05.893
...but your intentions remain unclear.

56:08.502 --> 56:10.838
Let me spell it out for you.

56:27.990 --> 56:29.781
I see.

56:33.398 --> 56:35.380
We have been searching for you.

56:36.183 --> 56:38.102
The king is very ill.

56:38.774 --> 56:41.701
You must return to Ares with us immediately.

56:41.797 --> 56:44.343
Your dedication to your post is admirable...

56:44.439 --> 56:46.551
...but no longer necessary.

56:46.647 --> 56:48.983
I will return to Ares soon enough.

56:49.415 --> 56:51.649
But first we must honor my brother...

56:51.889 --> 56:53.838
...with a funeral pyre.

56:58.549 --> 57:00.725
I am far from dead!

57:08.245 --> 57:10.996
- Well, that was unexpected.
- You said he was dead!

57:11.092 --> 57:13.975
He is! He just doesn't know it yet!

57:14.406 --> 57:16.197
After him!

57:28.265 --> 57:29.790
I hate bugs!

57:30.102 --> 57:31.558
Raine!

57:31.654 --> 57:35.063
Lorthos! You're still
on the wrong side, I see!

57:35.159 --> 57:36.887
That's Lorthos?

57:36.983 --> 57:40.719
From your stories I expected more.

57:40.815 --> 57:42.903
You'll make a nice pair of boots!

57:42.999 --> 57:45.941
This is pointless. Kill them all!

57:52.630 --> 57:54.957
- Make it hurt!
- With pleasure.

57:55.255 --> 57:57.571
Split up! Draw their fire!

58:29.045 --> 58:33.014
- Control, are you getting this?
- <i>Affirmative. Powering up.</i>

59:12.886 --> 59:14.389
Crotalus.

59:16.726 --> 59:19.062
- Cover me.
- What?

59:19.158 --> 59:20.949
Cover me!

59:52.661 --> 59:55.189
It's an honor to fight beside you.

59:57.078 --> 59:58.576
What's that?

01:00:03.446 --> 01:00:04.662
Incoming!

01:00:13.767 --> 01:00:16.279
Control, we could use those drones!

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:19.390
<i>Enemy targeted, engaging boosters.</i>

01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:31.863
Control, destroy all hostile targets.

01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:33.917
We're in pursuit of the heirs.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:36.537
<i>Affirmative.</i>

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:42.818
Drop it.

01:00:46.454 --> 01:00:48.149
Who exactly are you?

01:00:50.038 --> 01:00:51.829
Saber Raine.

01:00:52.054 --> 01:00:53.751
A mercenary.

01:00:53.847 --> 01:00:56.279
I prefer adventurer.

01:00:56.375 --> 01:00:58.918
Well, you've stumbled into quite
the adventure this time.

01:00:59.014 --> 01:01:01.190
Always seems to happen that way.

01:01:03.222 --> 01:01:04.981
Turn around.

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.195
You really don't understand
what's happening here.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:16.405
I... I think I do.

01:01:16.918 --> 01:01:19.095
You teamed up with some bad guys...

01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:20.989
...tried to kill your brother.

01:01:21.085 --> 01:01:25.175
Some sort of plan for world
domination, blah blah blah.

01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:29.797
My job was to find you. I'll let you
sort the rest out with your people.

01:01:29.893 --> 01:01:32.597
- So you're for hire?
- Yup.

01:01:33.846 --> 01:01:37.143
Damn, I guess that does make me a mercenary?

01:01:37.853 --> 01:01:42.183
But if you're thinking of making some
sort of counter offer, don't even bother.

01:01:42.518 --> 01:01:44.693
A man of principles.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:46.594
That's right.

01:01:52.725 --> 01:01:54.615
This changes everything.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:57.590
I am now open for negotiations.

01:01:59.766 --> 01:02:02.154
My prices are extremely reasonable.

01:02:05.903 --> 01:02:07.197
Kneel.

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:11.019
You need me to...

01:02:11.115 --> 01:02:14.837
...profess my undying loyalty,
I can do that. I can do that.

01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:26.134
Now, I never, ever wanted to hit a woman...

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:28.214
...let alone a princess but...

01:02:30.933 --> 01:02:34.592
...you did just try to cut my head off,
and on our first date.

01:02:35.287 --> 01:02:39.558
Your attempt at humor is simply
an effort to conceal your inadequacies...

01:02:39.654 --> 01:02:41.442
...as a man.

01:02:43.318 --> 01:02:45.110
You know what?

01:02:45.685 --> 01:02:47.798
I'm going to have no problem doing this.

01:03:08.053 --> 01:03:10.902
Perhaps your arrogance isn't a ploy.
You are quite skilled.

01:03:10.998 --> 01:03:12.898
You have no idea.

01:03:30.133 --> 01:03:31.861
Do it!

01:03:31.957 --> 01:03:33.685
I said do it!

01:03:41.973 --> 01:03:43.702
Better late than never.

01:03:53.398 --> 01:03:56.835
Unknown flyers.
Engage in air to air protocols.

01:05:18.133 --> 01:05:19.762
Farewell, hero!

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:33.909
- Can your weapons take that ship out?
- Possibly.

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:40.482
- Maximum power.
- Let's go.

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:47.253
And now you die!

01:05:47.637 --> 01:05:49.173
Here we go.

01:05:55.957 --> 01:05:58.167
I have gotta get me one of those.

01:05:58.263 --> 01:05:59.765
We didn't fire.

01:06:02.678 --> 01:06:04.852
<i>Enemy vessel destroyed.</i>

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:07.654
Always have backup.

01:06:10.773 --> 01:06:13.398
Control, prepare for boarding.

01:06:13.494 --> 01:06:15.221
Belay that order!

01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:20.694
There is a danger here far more
important than Caliope's treachery.

01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:23.735
Do we have any other vessel
to take us off this planet?

01:06:23.831 --> 01:06:26.041
Got my ship. <i>The Gladiator.</i>

01:06:26.137 --> 01:06:28.246
Then the trident has an important mission.

01:06:28.342 --> 01:06:30.294
<i>Awaiting orders.</i>

01:06:36.917 --> 01:06:40.406
He never goes anywhere without his guns.

01:06:59.305 --> 01:07:00.265
What is happening?

01:07:00.361 --> 01:07:02.583
My instincts tell me
we must leave this place.

01:07:02.679 --> 01:07:05.526
They are nothing! We have the power.

01:07:05.718 --> 01:07:08.403
If there's one thing
my long sleep has taught me.

01:07:08.499 --> 01:07:10.454
Winning is about survival.

01:07:10.934 --> 01:07:14.134
I was trapped on this planet once.
Never again!

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.302
Should we alert our allies?
Tell them to evacuate.

01:07:17.398 --> 01:07:20.502
I've routed all power to another task.

01:07:20.598 --> 01:07:22.742
Their fate is their own.

01:07:31.016 --> 01:07:33.142
<i>Energy cloak engaged.</i>

01:07:33.238 --> 01:07:35.349
<i>Nearing target area.</i>

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.667
Control, is the frequency I gave you set?

01:07:41.763 --> 01:07:46.134
<i>Affirmative. Deviant frequency
online and sonic projector charged.</i>

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.373
<i>Are you at a safe range?</i>

01:07:49.845 --> 01:07:52.789
<i>Please confirm you are at a safe range.</i>

01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:58.262
It doesn't matter, complete your mission.

01:07:58.358 --> 01:08:00.117
<i>Affirmative.</i>

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:56.758
It may not be her.

01:08:57.238 --> 01:08:59.028
It is.

01:08:59.733 --> 01:09:01.725
I can feel it.

01:09:27.317 --> 01:09:29.439
<i>That is disturbing news.</i>

01:09:29.535 --> 01:09:31.600
<i>If the threat is as dire as you suggest...</i>

01:09:31.696 --> 01:09:34.966
<i>...you will have the full support
of the Star Sentinels.</i>

01:09:35.062 --> 01:09:39.955
Thank you, Kandra Syn. I believe he
will remain outside populated areas.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.718
Perhaps as far as rogue space.

01:09:41.814 --> 01:09:44.643
<i>Our scout ships will patrol the outer reach.</i>

01:09:44.738 --> 01:09:48.085
If he is found, he must be dealt with.

01:09:49.332 --> 01:09:50.514
<i>Aren't we overreacting?</i>

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:54.518
<i>Since when has earth had a problem with
shooting first and asking questions later?</i>

01:09:54.614 --> 01:09:58.774
<i>Please, Ambassador Steele,
we must all be united in this effort.</i>

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.607
<i>We have to be proactive, not reactive.</i>

01:10:01.942 --> 01:10:04.182
<i>Do my ears deceive me?</i>

01:10:04.566 --> 01:10:06.765
<i>The Aresian empire...</i>

01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:08.818
<i>...the lunar council of the Ghost Nebula...</i>

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:11.251
<i>...even the sentinel sisters.</i>

01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:13.599
<i>You are all actually afraid.</i>

01:10:13.695 --> 01:10:16.375
<i>It's not fear that guides our hand.</i>

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:18.708
<i>It's wisdom.</i>

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.913
<i>There's always going to be
destructive forces in the universe...</i>

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.821
<i>...that need to be opposed.</i>

01:10:23.917 --> 01:10:26.965
<i>It is extreme...</i>

01:10:27.061 --> 01:10:29.604
<i>...to invoke a call to arms for just one man.</i>

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.522
<i>Ambassador. Sinjin is far more
than a mere man.</i>

01:10:33.618 --> 01:10:37.270
<i>Our race was part of that war, so long ago.</i>

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.990
<i>We know first hand of his malevolence.</i>

01:10:40.086 --> 01:10:42.134
<i>Should there even be a chance he lives...</i>

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:44.384
<i>...we must be prepared.</i>

01:10:44.479 --> 01:10:47.311
Which is why I think
developing a military task force...

01:10:47.407 --> 01:10:50.294
...that is not only capable
of protecting our worlds...

01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:53.750
...but also those that cannot
protect themselves is necessary.

01:10:53.846 --> 01:10:55.862
Do I have your support?

01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:58.743
<i>I will get word to my sisters in all sectors.</i>

01:11:00.182 --> 01:11:01.954
<i>We are at your disposal.</i>

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:06.007
<i>I would like a word in private.</i>

01:11:07.158 --> 01:11:08.938
Very well.

01:11:18.645 --> 01:11:21.002
- <i>Prince Tyr.</i>
- It's King Tyr now.

01:11:21.098 --> 01:11:25.205
As you are well aware,
my father died days after my return.

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.044
<i>Saber Raine.</i>

01:11:30.005 --> 01:11:31.958
<i>We would like him to be returned.</i>

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:35.798
No, Ambassador. Captain Raine
is the leader of my new vanguard.

01:11:35.894 --> 01:11:38.777
And as such, he is considered
to be a citizen of Ares.

01:11:40.566 --> 01:11:43.511
<i>This will not go over well with my people.</i>

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.116
<i>And to think that he still
travels with a Saurian...</i>

01:11:47.212 --> 01:11:48.982
Is not your concern!

01:11:49.077 --> 01:11:51.222
We have a real threat looming over us.

01:11:51.318 --> 01:11:53.462
And they have proven themselves worthy.

01:11:53.558 --> 01:11:56.982
We all have pasts, Ambassador,
some darker than others.

01:11:57.078 --> 01:11:59.767
I suggest you stay focused
on the darkness ahead.

01:12:01.493 --> 01:12:03.350
<i>Very well, King Tyr.</i>

01:12:03.446 --> 01:12:06.134
<i>I will confer with the earth confederation.</i>

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:10.855
<i>And my condolences on the passing
of your father to the next phase.</i>

01:12:17.877 --> 01:12:19.863
You handled that well, kid.

01:12:20.342 --> 01:12:24.556
I need their help, but I cannot tell them
what I learned about our dark origin.

01:12:24.652 --> 01:12:27.542
I know. Your people have risen
from the ashes of the past.

01:12:27.638 --> 01:12:30.486
Been reborn. You will lead them to greatness.

01:12:30.582 --> 01:12:34.805
With men like you and Saber by my side,
we can build a brighter future.

01:12:34.901 --> 01:12:37.366
- We can.
- I trust all is prepared?

01:12:37.462 --> 01:12:39.237
- Yes.
- Find her.

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.725
You clean up nice.

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:07.061
You look amazing.

01:13:10.037 --> 01:13:11.764
What is it?

01:13:14.037 --> 01:13:16.993
It's been a long time
since I've seen a real city.

01:13:20.789 --> 01:13:24.214
Walked among people
without feeling like a target.

01:13:24.598 --> 01:13:26.101
Well...

01:13:27.796 --> 01:13:29.558
...you're safe with me here.

01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:31.796
Just saying.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.220
Like we didn't see that one coming.

01:13:49.237 --> 01:13:50.741
Status of the ship?

01:13:50.837 --> 01:13:52.966
Aresian power core installed.

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:56.757
Ion engine capacity improved by 300%.

01:13:56.853 --> 01:13:58.837
Weapons upgraded.

01:14:00.117 --> 01:14:01.588
Excellent.

01:14:02.293 --> 01:14:04.086
I have something for you.

01:14:04.758 --> 01:14:08.277
A gift, from the king, on my recommendation.

01:14:09.525 --> 01:14:11.841
Now this is something I can use.

01:14:12.246 --> 01:14:15.380
So, what's next, Captain?

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.102
Simple.

01:14:18.198 --> 01:14:20.213
We save the universe.

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.372
What are they?

01:15:01.557 --> 01:15:04.052
A long forgotten army.

01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:07.188
My army.

01:15:08.085 --> 01:15:09.510
To control them...

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:13.536
...you will learn to manipulate
the mana stone, as I have.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.453
- Will I...
- Yes.

01:15:19.029 --> 01:15:21.686
You'll go through a transformation.

01:15:21.782 --> 01:15:24.341
But what you lose in beauty...

01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:28.500
...you will gain in unbridled power.

01:15:37.797 --> 01:15:39.589
Teach me.
