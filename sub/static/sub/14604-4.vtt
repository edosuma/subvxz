00:01.338 --> 00:04.286

<i>there was just me,</i>

00:04.406 --> 00:08.042
<i>Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw</i>
<i>from Castlebury, Connecticut.</i>

00:08.077 --> 00:09.943
I wanna be with you, even though
there are no guarantees.

00:09.978 --> 00:12.613
Bennet and I are just
hanging out, nothing official.

00:12.648 --> 00:14.382
Just keeping it easy breezy.

00:14.416 --> 00:15.550
I feel nothing for you.

00:15.584 --> 00:16.984
- Nothing, huh?
- Nothing.

00:17.019 --> 00:19.020
Anytime we're together,
it's chaos.

00:19.054 --> 00:20.354
Nothing about us is simple.

00:20.389 --> 00:22.056
You're really offering me
a job?

00:22.090 --> 00:23.224
I thought you might be ready
to re-up,

00:23.258 --> 00:24.392
get back in with the big boys.

00:24.426 --> 00:26.294
Well, it'll be nice
to have you around.

00:26.328 --> 00:27.828
From one Bradshaw to another.

00:27.863 --> 00:30.197
You are following in your
daughter's footsteps.

00:30.232 --> 00:31.432
Wanna go for a ride?

00:31.466 --> 00:33.567
I think I would rather
spend my time with someone

00:33.602 --> 00:35.336
who actually thinks
I deserve a future.

00:35.370 --> 00:37.972
I'm just looking for something.
No strings attached,

00:38.006 --> 00:39.273
'cause I'm already attached.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.441
Feels like no strings attached

00:40.475 --> 00:41.942
might be just the game
I'm looking for.

00:41.977 --> 00:44.378
All I do is make things crazy
for you,

00:44.413 --> 00:46.781
and I want things
to be simpler for you.

00:46.815 --> 00:48.749
So I'm gonna let you go.

00:48.784 --> 00:50.050
I know it's over.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.870
Well, it looks like
someone's been busy

01:43.905 --> 01:46.139
while the rest of us were
at school.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.175
Well, you gotta stay busy
if you wanna be a rainmaker.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.711
I've been researching
story pitches like crazy.

01:50.745 --> 01:52.412
And I think
Larissa's into it, too.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.614
She hasn't asked me to make her
a cappuccino once today.

01:55.817 --> 01:58.151
You got here fast.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.854
Uh, yeah. I skipped last period
to get the early train.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.823
Because every second I spend
in the suburbs, I'm like,

02:02.857 --> 02:04.591
"Calgon, take me away."

02:04.625 --> 02:06.860
How about you,
my budding literary lion?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.261
How's the pitch coming?

02:08.295 --> 02:10.130
Well, I think
I finally narrowed it down

02:10.163 --> 02:11.731
from the ten topics
I started with

02:11.766 --> 02:14.768
to something I'm really
excited about... Adam Weaver.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.170
The young playwright I've been
reading about in Arts & Leisure?

02:17.204 --> 02:18.438
I hate him.
He's gonna win a Tony

02:18.472 --> 02:20.373
before most people
even graduate from college.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.675
I know.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.343
My new school writing class
talks of nothing else.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.378
I mean, he's so inspiring.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.380
Or calculating.
Writing about a dead brother?

02:27.415 --> 02:29.215
It's guaranteed a nomination
at least.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.817
That is so sad and depressing.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.352
Or profound.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.943
Or a total lie, made up
so he can win an award.

02:34.063 --> 02:36.055
- That's awful.
- Or the truth.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.825
That's why my piece on him
is going to be so amazing.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.294
I'm going to get to the bottom
of Adam Weaver's story.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.896
Hey, Blake.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.131
Why you slumming down here
in editorial?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.833
Looking to borrow a cute outfit
from the fashion closet?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.835
With my expense account,
I don't need to <i>borrow.</i>

02:48.869 --> 02:50.303
Ugh. You're so lucky.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.571
I'm Blake.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.206
Walt.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.841
I feel like I've seen you
a lot here recently,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.476
in the elevator and stuff.
You new here?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.344
Sadly, I'm just
an "Interview" groupie.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.879
Oh, don't sell yourself short.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.748
You really shouldn't,
because you are adorable.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.250
- Huh?
- Say what?

03:04.284 --> 03:05.485
I mean, you are, but...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.687
I think Blake here is trying
to ask you out.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.055
Am I right?

03:09.089 --> 03:10.823
You are correct.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.194
<i>While all eyes were on Walt,</i>

03:15.229 --> 03:17.697
<i>my sister was excited</i>
<i>to have no eyes on her.</i>

03:17.731 --> 03:20.099
I love it that we have the place
to ourselves.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.103
You know what I don't love?

03:24.137 --> 03:27.006
Your tiny bed.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.042
Oh. I can fix that.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.548
You comin'?

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.993 --> 03:48.561
So...

03:48.595 --> 03:50.663
Was that as weird for you
as it was for me?

03:50.697 --> 03:52.932
Because it was
<i>really</i> weird for me.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.366
Well, it wasn't exactly
comfortable.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.736
But rules are rules, and I've
always said we're not exclusive.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.104
So you think I should
go out with him?

03:59.139 --> 04:00.272
It's your call.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.207
And I'd be a hypocrite
if I said "no."

04:02.242 --> 04:04.243
And if you wanna go out
with some guy who wears a suit

04:04.277 --> 04:07.713
and sells ads for a living,
who am I to stop you?

04:18.358 --> 04:19.825
Hello?

04:19.858 --> 04:23.195
Oh, hey, Mrs. Kelly.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.330
My dad's in Augusta, huh?

04:25.365 --> 04:27.866
Guess he's really into golf
lately.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.568
No, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.969
I know the drill.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.672
Mm-hmm. Found it. No problem.

04:33.706 --> 04:37.442
Hey, I gotta go.
Don't wanna be late.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.618
<i>As Sebastian was kicking back,
I was digging in.</i>

04:46.653 --> 04:47.786
So what do you think?

04:47.820 --> 04:49.955
What do I think?
I think he is 19,

04:49.989 --> 04:52.891
I think he's dealt with death
and is properly gorgeous,

04:52.925 --> 04:54.359
which means
he's right up your alley.

04:54.394 --> 04:55.761
I never said he's gorgeous.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.629
Well, you should.
What's wrong with you?

04:57.663 --> 04:58.797
Didn't you see his picture

04:58.831 --> 05:00.398
in last Sunday's
Arts & Leisure section?

05:00.433 --> 05:01.833
Scrumptious.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.035
Larissa, he's not
a piece of candy.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.303
I'd swallow him whole.

05:05.338 --> 05:06.605
Great.
The only problem is

05:06.639 --> 05:08.673
your playwright is already
the talk of the town.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.175
There are pieces on him
all over...

05:10.209 --> 05:11.509
Including "Talk Of The Town."

05:11.544 --> 05:13.111
So what would make yours
any different?

05:13.145 --> 05:15.113
Well, all the pieces on him
are profiles,

05:15.147 --> 05:16.715
but no one's ever done
a full-on interview.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.683
Hmm. You know, where they
get the really juicy stuff.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.884
Interesting.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.454
I'm working on getting tickets
to his reading

05:22.488 --> 05:24.289
at... at the drama warehouse
next week.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.191
All right,
my plucky little princess.

05:26.225 --> 05:29.227
You get me a juicy interview,
and I will publish it.

05:29.261 --> 05:30.795
That's great.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.963
One thing, though.

05:31.997 --> 05:33.665
In all
your meticulous research,

05:33.699 --> 05:36.367
you doubtless already know that
your 19-year-old wunderkind

05:36.402 --> 05:39.871
has become somewhat infamous
for <i>not</i> granting interviews.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.008
Yes. Of course I knew that.

05:44.043 --> 05:48.012
Then <i>you</i> obviously have a plan
for crossing that bridge.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.314
Fantastic!

05:49.348 --> 05:50.815
I can't wait to read all
the dirt you're gonna dig up.

05:50.849 --> 05:53.685
And please, darling,
make it filthy...

05:53.719 --> 05:56.521
So filthy I'll need
a long, hot shower.

05:56.555 --> 05:57.955
Yes, for sure.

05:57.990 --> 06:01.392
I'll... I'll be like a pig in mud,
it'll be so filthy and dirty.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.395
Mmm! Delicious.

06:04.430 --> 06:07.198
<i>I knew then the boundary</i>
<i>between intern and writer</i>

06:07.232 --> 06:10.201
<i>was going to be</i>
<i>a tough one to cross.</i>

06:10.235 --> 06:11.636
Really <i>tough.</i>

06:20.301 --> 06:21.968
I haven't stood this long
in a line

06:22.003 --> 06:24.104
since I waited for
my Shawn Cassidy tickets.

06:24.138 --> 06:25.405
He was <i>so</i> cute.

06:25.439 --> 06:26.573
<i>Is</i> so cute.

06:26.607 --> 06:27.907
I loved him
in "The Hardy Boys."

06:27.942 --> 06:30.744
You know, I'm so glad
Larissa isn't coming,

06:30.778 --> 06:32.712
'cause now I don't have to admit
to her that I have no idea

06:32.747 --> 06:35.248
how I'm gonna get an interview
with that Weaver kid.

06:35.282 --> 06:38.084
I knew it!
Carrie, you can't fool a pro.

06:38.119 --> 06:39.419
And I should probably warn you,

06:39.453 --> 06:41.087
I might have a better shot
of landing the interview

06:41.121 --> 06:43.056
- than you do.
- What do you mean?

06:43.090 --> 06:46.626
Um, hello!
Adam Weaver is witty, hot,

06:46.660 --> 06:48.294
and in touch with his emotions,

06:48.329 --> 06:49.896
not to mtion
he works in the theater.

06:49.930 --> 06:51.998
Does it ring any bells?

06:52.032 --> 06:54.234
He's got to be gay,

06:54.268 --> 06:56.302
which means I'm the one
with the in.

06:56.337 --> 06:59.639
Wait. Y-you'd work that angle
with him?

06:59.673 --> 07:02.275
Honey, I'd work any angle
to get a good story.

07:02.309 --> 07:03.676
Wow.

07:03.711 --> 07:06.446
So you'd even try to sleep
with someone for an interview?

07:06.480 --> 07:09.215
What? No. What...
Who said that?

07:09.249 --> 07:12.718
Sleeping with the subject
of a piece is a strict no-no.

07:12.753 --> 07:16.656
However, a little flirting
never hurt anyone.

07:16.690 --> 07:18.457
May the best writer win.

07:18.492 --> 07:21.794
Remind me again why I invited
you to come with me.

07:25.365 --> 07:26.666
It's strange, right?

07:26.700 --> 07:28.301
- I mean, it's one thing for...
-  Bennet...

07:28.335 --> 07:30.236
To say we're not exclusive.

07:30.270 --> 07:32.104
But you should've seen him
practically daring me

07:32.139 --> 07:33.940
to go out with this guy.

07:33.974 --> 07:35.207
If Bennet is stupid enough

07:35.242 --> 07:37.376
that he actually wants you
to date other people,

07:37.411 --> 07:38.911
then you definitely should.

07:38.945 --> 07:40.321
But what if I don't want to?

07:40.441 --> 07:42.281
Too bad!
Suck it up and do it.

07:42.315 --> 07:44.283
You scare me sometimes, Mouse.

07:44.317 --> 07:45.751
Sometimes I scare myself.

07:45.786 --> 07:47.353
What are you talking about?

07:47.387 --> 07:49.422
Oh. Guys.
Walt was just asking...

07:49.456 --> 07:51.323
Sebastian.
It was just about Sebastian.

07:51.358 --> 07:52.658
Um, what about him?

07:52.692 --> 07:55.828
I... haven't seen him in school
recently.

07:55.862 --> 07:56.996
Is he sick or something?

07:57.030 --> 07:58.163
You're right.
He hasn't been

07:58.198 --> 07:59.899
in modern European history
all week.

07:59.933 --> 08:02.034
Or in español.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.502
I mean, not... not that
I've been looking.

08:03.536 --> 08:06.472
But since you mentioned it...
I think. Or... whatever.

08:07.707 --> 08:09.174
Anyway, I've gotta go.

08:09.209 --> 08:11.944
American history beckons
with its suckitude.

08:11.978 --> 08:13.178
- Mm.
- Later.

08:13.213 --> 08:15.514
Bye.

08:15.548 --> 08:16.949
Okay, what was that about?

08:16.983 --> 08:18.317
We weren't even talking
about Sebastian.

08:18.351 --> 08:20.352
I know. Sorry. I panicked.

08:20.387 --> 08:21.954
I just didn't think Maggie
was ready to hear

08:21.988 --> 08:23.722
about me dating <i>two</i> guys.

08:23.757 --> 08:24.890
You know?

08:24.924 --> 08:26.425
Ah, got it.

08:26.459 --> 08:28.227
Good question about Sebastian,
though.

08:28.261 --> 08:29.728
I wonder where he is.

09:03.396 --> 09:07.032
Hey there, Mrs. Robinson.
Any interest in some fun?

09:07.066 --> 09:10.535
Troy,
we loved you so much,

09:10.570 --> 09:14.039
and we know how much you loved
Cayuga Lake.

09:15.308 --> 09:18.343
That is why we're here,
scattering your ashes

09:18.377 --> 09:21.646
on the water that meant so much
to you.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.368
Sorry. I'm...
just... sorry.

09:56.081 --> 09:59.150
You are
more than just your remains, Troy.

09:59.184 --> 10:01.919
You are
the memories left behind.

10:01.954 --> 10:03.721
Shh.

10:03.756 --> 10:05.890
You are all
the things that you loved...

10:05.924 --> 10:08.826
Like cheeseburgers.

10:10.996 --> 10:15.199
And Farrah Fawcett...

10:15.234 --> 10:16.634
Majors.

10:23.041 --> 10:26.010
I have to say,
you've impressed me, Tom.

10:26.044 --> 10:28.245
Last time Credit Suisse had
dealings with Long & Whitney,

10:28.280 --> 10:30.881
your buddy Harlan, frankly,
left a bad taste in our mouths.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.083
Oh, let me guess.

10:32.117 --> 10:34.085
He, uh, took off for Vegas,
hit the strip clubs,

10:34.119 --> 10:35.419
and then billed you
for the hours.

10:35.454 --> 10:37.621
No. He must've done that with Lehman.

10:37.656 --> 10:39.423
With us, he ran off
to Saint-Tropez.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.959
Well, all I can do
is assure you that with me,

10:41.993 --> 10:43.227
things will be different.

10:43.261 --> 10:44.662
I can see that,
and I like the fact

10:44.696 --> 10:46.997
that you ran
your own small-town firm.

10:47.032 --> 10:49.767
Frankly, we could use
that kind of service.

10:49.801 --> 10:52.369
What the hell?
Tom, you've sold me.

10:52.404 --> 10:54.972
That is fantastic news.

10:55.006 --> 10:56.207
You won't be disappointed.

10:57.509 --> 10:59.944
Listen, here is...

10:59.978 --> 11:01.545
My home number,

11:01.579 --> 11:04.515
my cellular phone.

11:04.549 --> 11:06.317
You call me anytime.

11:06.351 --> 11:08.052
I'll either be at work
or in Connecticut

11:08.086 --> 11:10.387
or somewhere in between,
not Saint-Tropez.

11:10.422 --> 11:13.176
<i>While my dad had made</i>
<i>a great impression,</i>

11:13.296 --> 11:15.526
<i>I was worried</i>
<i>I'd made a terrible one.</i>

11:15.560 --> 11:16.994
Why did I have to laugh?

11:17.028 --> 11:19.363
I'm almost impressed.
I never would've imagined

11:19.397 --> 11:21.165
you had such
a sadistic sense of humor.

11:21.199 --> 11:23.801
Uh-oh.
There's Adam Weaver now.

11:23.835 --> 11:26.670
I'm not sadistic. I just...
couldn't help myself.

11:26.704 --> 11:29.239
Well, you need to decide whether
you want to be noticed or not,

11:29.274 --> 11:31.875
because Weaver is staring right at you.

11:31.910 --> 11:34.645
Oh, no. Maybe I should just
make a run for it.

11:34.679 --> 11:35.979
If it were me,

11:36.014 --> 11:38.415
I'd start by apologizing
and asking him for forgiveness,

11:38.449 --> 11:39.816
which he probably won't,

11:39.851 --> 11:42.352
so you better hope that Larissa
doesn't send you to Siberia,

11:42.387 --> 11:45.783
which means you'll be making her
cappuccinos <i>every day.</i>

11:45.903 --> 11:47.758
I already make her cappuccinos
every day.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.326
Well, you won't if you get
this interview.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.761
- Oh, he's coming this way.
 - Oh, God.

11:50.795 --> 11:52.896
Good luck.
Oh. Oh, God. Okay.

11:52.930 --> 11:55.699
You're the one who laughed,
aren't you?

11:55.733 --> 11:56.766
During the funeral scene.
I'm sorry.

11:56.801 --> 11:59.269
I know
it was inappropriate. Uh...

11:59.303 --> 12:02.706
The truth is, it... it reminded me
of my mother's funeral.

12:02.740 --> 12:04.207
Um, I laughed there, too,

12:04.242 --> 12:06.443
which was
even <i>more</i> inappropriate.

12:06.477 --> 12:07.577
Really?

12:07.612 --> 12:08.945
I can't watch this.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.113
It had been a long day.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.848
We were all just exhausted,
drained,

12:11.882 --> 12:14.517
and, uh, then it's time
to lower the coffin.

12:14.552 --> 12:16.119
And this is it.
You know, my mother is

12:16.153 --> 12:18.621
about to disappear
into the ground forever.

12:18.656 --> 12:19.789
And then...

12:19.824 --> 12:22.792
Thunk! It won't fit...
Her coffin.

12:22.827 --> 12:24.227
The... the hole's too small.

12:24.261 --> 12:26.796
But for some reason, these guys,
they just... they won't give up.

12:26.831 --> 12:28.531
It's a funeral, you know,

12:28.566 --> 12:29.899
so they... they probably
just think

12:29.934 --> 12:31.634
they're being respectful.

12:31.669 --> 12:33.203
So we're all
just standing around

12:33.237 --> 12:37.407
as it goes thunk, thunk, thunk,
thunk, thunk, thunk!

12:37.441 --> 12:40.243
And at some point,
it just seemed ridiculous,

12:40.277 --> 12:41.711
so that's why I laughed.

12:41.745 --> 12:45.548
I-I've been there,
and... and it's awful, but...

12:45.583 --> 12:48.217
So awful it's... it's kind of
funny.

12:49.286 --> 12:50.853
I loved that you laughed.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.624
The scene is supposed
to be funny.

12:54.658 --> 12:58.594
None of these other
phony dimwits picked up on that.

12:58.629 --> 13:01.164
They were so busy thinking about
how it's... it's a funeral.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.498
It's supposed to be sad.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.600
How could it possibly
be funny, too?

13:04.635 --> 13:07.069
Yeah, my producer
thinks I should change it.

13:07.104 --> 13:09.572
No, don't. It's perfect.

13:09.606 --> 13:11.674
I'm not going to,

13:11.708 --> 13:15.811
as long as one person
who truly understands gets it.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.782
And the rest of these people
can kiss my grits.

13:19.816 --> 13:21.083
Wait.
Are you an "Alice" fan?

13:21.118 --> 13:22.618
- Totally.
- Oh.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.291
Adam Weaver,

13:28.325 --> 13:30.092
but everyone
just calls me "Weaver."

13:30.127 --> 13:32.595
Carrie Bradshaw.
"Interview" magazine.

13:32.629 --> 13:35.965
I was hoping I'd get a chance
to talk to you.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.933
Well, some of us are headed
to McSorley's to grab a drink.

13:37.968 --> 13:39.168
You wanna come?

13:39.202 --> 13:41.203
Yeah, I'd love to.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.095
Great.

13:42.215 --> 13:44.707
<i>Looks like I was</i>
<i>one step closer to my story.</i>

13:52.424 --> 13:55.793
Seriously? They didn't let women
in here until when?

13:55.828 --> 13:58.696
1970. 15 years ago.

13:58.731 --> 14:00.965
Although judging by
the sawdust on the floor,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.468
I'm betting women weren't
exactly beating down the door

14:03.502 --> 14:04.769
to get in here.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.404
I-I hadn't thought of that.

14:07.706 --> 14:09.240
You know,
it does... it does smell

14:09.274 --> 14:10.875
a little like
a stale frat house in here.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.378
A little?

14:13.412 --> 14:15.713
Well, let me ask you
a question about the play.

14:15.748 --> 14:18.916
Or we could play
a drinking game. Like quarters?

14:18.951 --> 14:20.218
Come on, Adam.

14:20.252 --> 14:22.019
- Weaver.
- Weaver.

14:22.054 --> 14:24.255
You do realize
that's about the tenth time

14:24.289 --> 14:25.423
you've changed the subject

14:25.457 --> 14:27.391
when I've tried to talk to you
about <i>you?</i>

14:27.426 --> 14:28.726
Mm-hmm.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.561
How come you've never given
an interview?

14:30.596 --> 14:33.331
I-I'm sure people are
beating down your door.

14:33.365 --> 14:34.732
Trampling it.

14:34.766 --> 14:35.967
Uh...

14:36.001 --> 14:38.736
I'm the toast of the town,
or so I've heard.

14:38.770 --> 14:41.539
So why not let people know you,
hear what you have to say?

14:41.573 --> 14:44.075
Well, every... everything
I <i>wanna</i> say is... is in my plays,

14:44.109 --> 14:45.976
and with a lot more time
for editing.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.882
All right, Carrie Bradshaw,

14:51.917 --> 14:53.084
here's my deal.

14:53.118 --> 14:55.719
If you tell me
something personal about you,

14:55.754 --> 14:59.857
then I'll <i>think</i> about telling
you something personal about me.

14:59.891 --> 15:01.025
That doesn't sound fair.

15:01.059 --> 15:02.860
Mm, my game, my rules.

15:02.894 --> 15:05.496
Okay, one personal story
from Carrie Bradshaw.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.530
Keep it real.

15:06.565 --> 15:08.399
And... go.

15:08.433 --> 15:09.934
I'm trying to interview you.

15:09.968 --> 15:12.169
You don't need
to know anything about me.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.771
Now see,
that's where you're wrong.

15:13.805 --> 15:17.074
I am desperate to learn more.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.878
You're making this
very confusing.

15:20.912 --> 15:24.715
I'm very good at that.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.017
<i>Every time I tried to</i>
<i>establish my boundaries,</i>

15:27.052 --> 15:28.786
<i>Weaver kept moving his around.</i>

15:28.820 --> 15:30.521
Oh, hey, Barbara.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.655
What are you still doing here?

15:31.689 --> 15:32.923
It's almost 9:00
on Friday night.

15:32.957 --> 15:34.591
You know I work for Harlan,
right?

15:34.626 --> 15:35.926
It's almost the weekend.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.361
Those don't exist in my world.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.197
What about you?
Any fun weekend plans?

15:40.231 --> 15:42.432
My, uh, girlfriend and her son
are coming over,

15:42.467 --> 15:44.401
and they're gonna meet my girls
for the first time.

15:44.435 --> 15:46.470
Uh-oh. When worlds collide.

15:46.504 --> 15:48.872
When my kids met
my ex-boyfriend Donny,

15:48.906 --> 15:51.575
there was a lot of drinking
and a hospital visit involved.

15:51.609 --> 15:52.976
Good luck with that.

15:55.380 --> 15:56.646
Oh, almost forgot.

15:56.681 --> 15:58.148
How'd it go with Credit Suisse?

15:58.182 --> 16:00.083
- Waste of time?
- Nope.

16:00.118 --> 16:01.852
I landed the account.

16:01.886 --> 16:04.321
Seriously?

16:04.355 --> 16:05.989
I thought Harlan pretty much
blew it with them

16:06.023 --> 16:07.624
after he ran off
to Saint-Tropez.

16:07.658 --> 16:09.493
Or was that the time
with the strippers?

16:09.527 --> 16:12.028
I don't know. Anyway,
how'd you turn them around?

16:12.063 --> 16:13.630
You must be a pretty good liar.

16:13.664 --> 16:15.765
Mm, no lying involved.
I just made it clear

16:15.800 --> 16:18.134
that I'd be more available
to 'em than Harlan was.

16:18.169 --> 16:19.469
Well,
that wouldn't be hard.

16:19.503 --> 16:21.438
Yeah, gaem
my home phone number and, uh,

16:21.472 --> 16:23.273
told 'em I'd pretty much
be there for them 24/7.

16:23.307 --> 16:25.108
That kind of sealed the deal.

16:25.142 --> 16:28.378
That sealed something,
all right... your fate.

16:28.412 --> 16:30.113
What do you mean?

16:30.147 --> 16:33.783
Firms like them... they are not
your neighbors or your friends.

16:33.818 --> 16:36.453
They won't think twice
about eating your life up.

16:36.487 --> 16:37.620
Harlan might be lazy

16:37.655 --> 16:39.489
and occasionally
ethically questionable,

16:39.523 --> 16:41.491
but he knows how
to set boundaries.

16:41.525 --> 16:43.726
He won't give his home number
to <i>anyone,</i>

16:43.761 --> 16:45.662
not even his girlfriends.

16:45.696 --> 16:48.565
Anyway, good luck this weekend.

16:48.599 --> 16:50.466
Hope you don't have to
cancel your plans.

16:54.872 --> 16:56.506
For a kid who has
the dream life,

16:56.540 --> 16:58.441
you don't seem so happy.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.209
What happened to
keeping it casual?

17:00.244 --> 17:02.812
Honey, I'm a bored housewife.

17:02.846 --> 17:05.080
At least let me live
vicariously.

17:05.115 --> 17:07.083
It's not that exciting.

17:07.117 --> 17:11.421
Please. I'm sure the girls
at your school are all over you.

17:11.454 --> 17:13.156
No, not the one that matters.

17:14.758 --> 17:17.859
What happened? You cheat?

17:17.895 --> 17:19.194
Men always cheat.

17:19.229 --> 17:21.864
Said by the bored housewife
in bed with me.

17:21.898 --> 17:24.967
That's different. I'm ignored,
so he deserves it.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.036
I'm not complaining.

17:27.069 --> 17:30.506
So how'd you screw it up
with her?

17:30.540 --> 17:34.110
I hurt her. It seemed like
I was always hurting her.

17:34.144 --> 17:37.079
I didn't want to do that
anymore, so I let her go.

17:37.114 --> 17:40.583
Is that your weak excuse
for not wanting to be faithful?

17:40.617 --> 17:44.286
No, it's the truth.
I just want her to be happy.

17:44.321 --> 17:47.156
Wow.

17:47.190 --> 17:49.458
You must really
be in love with this girl.

17:49.493 --> 17:52.528
Maybe for the rest of my life.

17:54.498 --> 17:56.432
Does it get any easier?

17:56.466 --> 17:58.434
Not really.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.102
Mnh-mnh.

18:00.136 --> 18:03.439
Maybe a few distractions will help.

18:03.473 --> 18:06.709
♪ Free, free, set
them free ♪
♪ Oh, oh

18:06.743 --> 18:09.245
♪ free, free, set them free

18:09.279 --> 18:10.746
♪ if you need somebody

18:10.780 --> 18:12.448
♪ free, free, set them free

18:12.482 --> 18:14.350
<i>so</i> back to your play...

18:14.384 --> 18:16.852
Ugh. You are relentless.

18:16.886 --> 18:18.120
Did you write the funeral scene

18:18.154 --> 18:20.403
exactly as it happened
in real life,

18:20.523 --> 18:21.824
or did you embellish?

18:21.858 --> 18:23.992
<i>♪ Do the same</i>

18:24.027 --> 18:26.929
do <i>you</i> wanna know,
or is it just for your story?

18:26.963 --> 18:29.631
Both. Is that bad?

18:29.666 --> 18:31.166
<i>♪ And throw away the key</i>

18:31.201 --> 18:32.634
I didn't embellish.

18:32.669 --> 18:35.771
I mean, if anything, I actually
left some of the worst bits out.

18:35.805 --> 18:38.140
It got worse than what we saw?

18:38.174 --> 18:39.675
That was pretty grim.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.777
<i>♪ If you love...</i>

18:41.811 --> 18:43.011
Are we off the record?

18:43.046 --> 18:45.080
<i>♪ Somebody ♪ if you love...</i>

18:45.114 --> 18:47.949
Yes. Off the record.

18:47.984 --> 18:51.520
My mom did dump
several boxes of ashes

18:51.554 --> 18:53.822
and all the things she could
grab from my brother's room,

18:53.856 --> 18:55.824
including Farrah.

18:55.858 --> 18:58.994
But unlike the play,
I didn't hold it together.

18:59.028 --> 19:00.030
You cried?

19:00.150 --> 19:03.598
No. I...
laughed my ass off.

19:03.633 --> 19:06.635
Pretty much like you did.
I couldn't help it.

19:06.669 --> 19:09.171

19:11.407 --> 19:13.775
I also left out
the part where...

19:13.809 --> 19:15.277
My dad punched me in the face

19:15.311 --> 19:19.147
for mocking
his golden boy's death.

19:19.181 --> 19:20.615
Wow.

19:20.650 --> 19:22.751
Yeah.

19:22.785 --> 19:24.819
Yeah, we haven't talked since.

19:24.854 --> 19:29.290
I figured even the phony nitwits
would find that too dark.

19:30.493 --> 19:31.860
I'm sorry.

19:31.894 --> 19:35.230
I mean, my family and I went
through a lot after my mom died,

19:35.264 --> 19:37.465
but we still had each other.

19:37.500 --> 19:41.769

a terrible mistake.

20:07.775 --> 20:11.244
But I heard you two were getting
cozy and then left together.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.980
I thought you'd have got
some really juicy stuff.

20:14.014 --> 20:16.816

20:25.459 --> 20:27.159

20:37.771 --> 20:40.773
sort of, uh...
kissed Weaver.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.708
I know. I know.

20:42.743 --> 20:45.277

20:48.648 --> 20:51.450
Darling, your sense of morals
is <i>adorable.</i>

20:51.485 --> 20:55.287
But if you're having fun and it
helps you land a great story,

20:55.322 --> 20:57.456
then go with it!
It's win-win,

20:57.491 --> 20:59.625
plus you'll get
much juicier stuff this way.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.160
So go kiss him again

21:01.194 --> 21:02.661
and see what he says.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.464
Or better still,
sleep with him.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.333
And make sure
he's on the record this time.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.502
Uh, I-I gotta go.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.904
My dad's girlfriend is here.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.839
Ciao.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.747
Okay, great.
Carrie, you're here. And...

21:21.781 --> 21:24.016
All right. Here we go.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.352
- Hi. Deb.
-  Dylan!

21:27.387 --> 21:31.390
So glad you guys
could make it. Come on in.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.491
Hi. I'm Carrie.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.526
It is so nice
to finally meet you.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.061
And you must be Dorrit.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.729
Must be.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.268
Uh, everyone, this is Dylan.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.270
- Say hello, Dylan.
- Hello Dylan.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.573
Oh, God.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.475
We're not gonna have to do
any "Brady Bunch" crap, are we?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.344
Because you can count me out.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.213
Well, I always imagined

21:55.248 --> 21:57.682
our two families meeting
would be more "Godfather" style.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.184
Although I sure hope

21:59.218 --> 22:01.253
no one ends up with
a horse's head in their bed.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.625
We might just get along.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.501
Maggie,
what are you doing here?

22:16.535 --> 22:18.470
I was in the neighborhood
babysitting.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.572
Oh, gee, this is a nice place.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.874
So what's up with the visit?

22:22.908 --> 22:24.209
Oh, just noticed you were out.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.878
Thought you might be sick,
but clearly you're not. So...

22:26.912 --> 22:29.581
All right, well, it was
cool of you to stop by.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.583
Look, if you want company
or something...

22:31.617 --> 22:34.152
Is that the Chinese food? Oh.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.721
I didn't realize
you were with somebody.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.022
Uh, neither did I.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.891
Um...

22:39.925 --> 22:41.526
Wow. I didn't realize
you were so busy.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.762
I should get going.

22:44.797 --> 22:45.930
See you around.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.966
All right, see you later.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.771
- Was that your girl?
- No.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.974
'Cause that one definitely
has a crush on you.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.609
Yeah, whatever.
She's just bored.

22:57.643 --> 23:01.479
Trust me. The long looks?
The fast exit? She likes you.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.287
Bennet.
Oh. Hey.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.423
- What are you doing here?
- At "Interview"? I work here.

23:12.458 --> 23:14.859
I thought we
established that by now.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.761
I know you work here.
It's just... it's the weekend.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.095
And I'm on a deadline.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.597
It's the only reason I'm here
on a Saturday.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.200
So...
what are you doing here?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.802
I'm...
supposed to meet Blake.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.038
But I never would've agreed
to meet him here

23:27.072 --> 23:28.205
had I known that you...

23:28.240 --> 23:29.907
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.443
We're not exclusive. It's...
that's how it works.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.345
Right.

23:34.379 --> 23:36.614
Right. It's all cool here.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.949
Yep. The coolest.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.786
Um, so where you guys going
anyway?

23:41.820 --> 23:44.321
We're going to dinner
at the Silver Hen.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.057
In Soho?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.658
That place is nice.

23:47.692 --> 23:48.893
I guess. I don't know.
He picked it.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.394
It's pricey, too.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.630
It's the kind of place you'd go
on a real <i>date</i> date.

23:52.664 --> 23:53.964
Which it is.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.399
Right?

23:55.433 --> 23:57.067
Right.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.903
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.237
No problem.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.906
Hey, Bennet.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.008
You... okay?

24:04.042 --> 24:06.844
Yeah. I'm great.
Never better.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.012
You ready?

24:08.046 --> 24:10.080
Yes.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.281
Have fun.

24:22.293 --> 24:23.827
Is everyone good?

24:23.862 --> 24:25.929

if anybody wants a salad.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.899
Dad?

24:28.933 --> 24:30.601
You're trying too hard.
It's embarrassing...

24:30.635 --> 24:31.802
For you.

24:34.873 --> 24:37.708
I'm gonna make a salad.

24:40.278 --> 24:42.913
So, um, your dad tells me

24:42.947 --> 24:45.716
you got your first big writing
assignment at the magazine.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.784
Yeah, my... my boss has been
really cool.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.920
She lets me come up
with my own ideas

24:49.954 --> 24:52.255
- and then pitch them to her.
- That's amazing.

24:52.290 --> 24:55.225
You know, you're pretty together
for someone your age.

24:55.259 --> 24:57.127
Oh. Thank you.

24:57.161 --> 25:00.197
Dylan, honey, take a bite
of your pizza, okay?

25:01.466 --> 25:02.732
I'm talking to you.

25:02.767 --> 25:06.803
No, I hate pizza.
I only want tater tots.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.073
Um, I don't think we have
any tater tots,

25:10.107 --> 25:11.741
but my dad is making a salad.

25:11.776 --> 25:12.909
Tater tots!

25:16.013 --> 25:18.248
It's okay. I come prepared.

25:18.282 --> 25:20.417
He won't eat anything else.

25:20.451 --> 25:22.452

25:22.486 --> 25:24.454
So...

25:24.488 --> 25:26.589
My God, "Interview" magazine.

25:26.624 --> 25:30.226
I used to read that
all the time when I was younger.

25:30.261 --> 25:32.262
It's really hard to find
up here nowadays, though.

25:32.296 --> 25:35.565
I have some copies upstairs
if... you want them.

25:35.599 --> 25:37.333
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love that.

25:37.368 --> 25:38.701

26:14.922 --> 26:16.956
Oh, right.
You're not having any sex.

26:16.991 --> 26:19.826
The question is, are <i>you?</i>

26:19.860 --> 26:21.761
Uh, yeah. Duh.
What did you think?

26:21.796 --> 26:24.731
Well, I thought maybe you were,
but I didn't know.

26:24.765 --> 26:25.963
Now I do.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.765
You should just be glad
we're being safe.

26:27.885 --> 26:31.938
I am. But I'm not so happy
that ya did it in my room.

26:31.972 --> 26:34.639
Did you do it on my bed?

26:36.176 --> 26:39.445
You had <i>sex on my bed?</i>

26:39.480 --> 26:41.113
You better have changed
the sheets.

26:41.148 --> 26:42.448
We put down a towel.

26:42.482 --> 26:43.616

26:59.366 --> 27:03.936

my mommy and your dad

27:21.254 --> 27:23.522

27:23.557 --> 27:25.090
Would you please
stop saying "rubber"?

27:25.125 --> 27:26.592
Then I need something

I wanna see jugs.

- And I wanna see 'em now.
- Not that this matters,

27:33.435 --> 27:35.601
because this whole conversation
is completely disgusting,

27:35.635 --> 27:37.669
but there's only one "g"
in "jugs."

27:37.704 --> 27:40.205
Um, "boob juggs" have two g's.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.808
I don't want to talk about
this anymore.

27:42.842 --> 27:46.578
So then you gonna
show 'em to me or what?

27:46.613 --> 27:47.780
Dorrit!

27:47.814 --> 27:50.249
What? I don't care if
some pervy kid sees boobs.

27:50.283 --> 27:52.117
You are, under no circumstances,

27:52.151 --> 27:54.353
showing that pervy little kid
your boobs.

27:54.387 --> 27:56.021
So what should we do?

28:02.562 --> 28:04.529
We're going to kill him.

28:06.799 --> 28:08.266
Okay.

28:09.736 --> 28:11.303
I like this plan better.

28:11.337 --> 28:13.238
Do you know what a wedgie is,
Dylan?

28:13.272 --> 28:17.042
Did you know you can get
a wedgie so bad,

28:17.076 --> 28:20.112
it can actually kill you?

28:20.146 --> 28:21.646
No, it can't.

28:21.681 --> 28:25.317
This kid I knew,
his nuts just went... pop!

28:25.351 --> 28:26.485
Like grapes.

28:26.519 --> 28:28.587
So you better
keep your mouth shut

28:28.621 --> 28:30.255
about the rubber.

28:30.289 --> 28:33.925
And if you don't? Pop.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.227
Pop.

28:42.101 --> 28:43.802
We better follow him.

28:43.836 --> 28:46.137
Who knows what he's
gonna tell mommy. Mm.

28:48.374 --> 28:49.908
I was just looking for
the bathroom,

28:49.942 --> 28:51.643
and they said they were going
to kill me!

28:51.677 --> 28:53.878
With a wedgie.

28:55.214 --> 28:58.049
Uh, Dylan, sweetie, you're not
making this up, are you?

28:58.083 --> 28:59.484
No. They said it.

28:59.518 --> 29:01.152
No, we didn't.
We did.

29:01.187 --> 29:03.087
Um...

29:03.122 --> 29:05.823
What we're trying to say is
we told Dylan a story

29:05.858 --> 29:09.494
about a kid who "supposedly"
died from a wedgie.

29:09.528 --> 29:11.462
Um, it's just urban myth.

29:11.497 --> 29:13.431
We heard it
when we were his age.

29:13.465 --> 29:14.799
Thought he would think
it was funny.

29:14.833 --> 29:17.135
- We were just trying to...
- You know, bond.

29:17.169 --> 29:19.037
You know how it is,
kids that age.

29:19.071 --> 29:22.140
It's all about the wedgie.
Isn't it?

29:22.174 --> 29:24.208
At least we thought it was.

29:24.243 --> 29:27.311
Yeah, we... we were just
trying to make him laugh.

29:27.346 --> 29:28.646
That's not true!

29:28.680 --> 29:30.982
There are a lot of truths
that can be told today, Dylan.

29:31.016 --> 29:32.850
"Jugg" -fulls.

29:32.885 --> 29:35.219
Clearly, we got off
on the wrong foot.

29:35.254 --> 29:37.188
So why don't we start over?

29:37.222 --> 29:41.659
Um, we have all the fixings
for a sundae bar in the kitchen.

29:41.693 --> 29:43.027
You wanna go get
some ice cream?

29:43.061 --> 29:44.629
That could be nice.

29:44.663 --> 29:47.932
Dylan, what do you think?

29:49.601 --> 29:51.702
Okay.

29:51.737 --> 29:54.472
Okay.

30:09.454 --> 30:11.322
There's something weird
about that.

30:11.356 --> 30:14.358
I don't... my girls would never
threaten anyone.

30:14.392 --> 30:16.360
Well, Dorrit maybe,
but not Carrie.

30:16.394 --> 30:19.196
Yeah, I, uh, I don't know, Tom.

30:19.231 --> 30:21.165
I mean, the girls seem lovely and all...
Elephone rings)

30:21.199 --> 30:25.069
- But Dylan never lies. <i>Ever.</i>
<i>-  - Hello?</i>

30:25.103 --> 30:28.205
Um, dad, it's for you.

30:28.239 --> 30:30.541
- Who is it?
- Some guy from Credit Suisse.

30:30.575 --> 30:33.877
Oh. Okay. I'm so sorry.
I have to take this.

30:35.146 --> 30:37.548
Tom, it's Harvey
from Credit Suisse.

30:37.582 --> 30:38.849
Jeremy gave me your number.

30:38.883 --> 30:40.017
Hope this isn't a bad time.

30:40.051 --> 30:41.185
No, no, no. No, it's fine.

30:41.219 --> 30:42.753
Anytime you need me,
I'm right here.

30:42.787 --> 30:44.855
Great, because I have
some questions

30:44.889 --> 30:46.223
about the upcoming deal.

30:46.257 --> 30:47.624
Sure. I'm yours. Go ahead.

30:47.659 --> 30:49.226
I saw a rubber!

30:49.260 --> 30:50.727
Rubber, rubber, rubber!

30:50.762 --> 30:52.896
Boobies, boobies, boobies!

30:52.931 --> 30:54.464
I'm sorry.
Was that on your line?

30:54.499 --> 30:57.267
Juggs with two g's!

30:57.302 --> 30:59.670
Hey, uh, Dylan? Buddy?

30:59.704 --> 31:01.605
Do you think maybe you could
get off the phone?

31:01.639 --> 31:03.140
You should probably
go deal with that.

31:03.174 --> 31:05.042
No, no, it's fine.
I can still, uh...

31:08.680 --> 31:10.280
Okay, you know what?
Uh, Harvey, I gotta go.

31:11.482 --> 31:13.884
You've never been
to South of the border?

31:13.918 --> 31:16.553
That place on 95
with the big sombrero out front?

31:16.587 --> 31:18.021
Yeah, my family and I
have passed it

31:18.055 --> 31:19.289
on our way to Hilton head,

31:19.323 --> 31:21.158
but it...
 Looks so tacky.

31:21.192 --> 31:23.093
It's not tacky...
Kitschy and awesome.

31:23.127 --> 31:25.128
I
have 20 shot glasses from there.

31:25.162 --> 31:27.063
I'm very proud
of my collection.

31:27.098 --> 31:29.399
And you should be.

31:29.433 --> 31:30.934
Walt! Walt!

31:30.968 --> 31:32.269
Bennet?

31:32.303 --> 31:34.871
What are you doing here...
at the restaurant?

31:34.905 --> 31:36.072
Waiting for you.

31:36.107 --> 31:37.240
What took you so long?

31:37.275 --> 31:39.142
We walked here.
Why do you care?

31:39.176 --> 31:41.478
I care because...

31:41.512 --> 31:43.246
I don't want Walt to go
on this date.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.547
- Huh.
- What?

31:44.582 --> 31:47.784
Okay, can someone please tell me
what's going on here?

31:47.818 --> 31:49.853
Well, I-I'm sort of
dating Walt.

31:49.887 --> 31:51.688
Wait. You're dating Bennet?

31:51.722 --> 31:53.523
Why didn't you tell me?

31:53.557 --> 31:56.960
Uh, as Bennet knows,
we're not exclusive.

31:56.994 --> 31:59.796
So as far as I'm aware,
I'm not doing anything wrong.

31:59.830 --> 32:02.632
Right. No.

32:02.666 --> 32:03.967
Of course you aren't.

32:04.001 --> 32:07.303
Okay, there's obviously
something going on with you two,

32:07.338 --> 32:08.471
and, quite frankly,

32:08.505 --> 32:10.206
I don't like being put
in the middle of it.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.507
Blake, wait.

32:11.542 --> 32:12.875
Look, you're cute,

32:12.910 --> 32:15.411
but I don't need some sort of
psycho office romance drama.

32:15.446 --> 32:16.779
That's Larissa's job.

32:20.884 --> 32:22.218
What do you think you're doing?

32:22.252 --> 32:24.287
If you had a problem
with me dating someone,

32:24.321 --> 32:26.089
then you should've
said something.

32:26.123 --> 32:27.557
And P.S.,
<i>you're</i> the one

32:27.591 --> 32:29.659
who told me to go out with him
in the first place.

32:29.693 --> 32:31.861
Look...

32:31.895 --> 32:33.896
You're completely right.

32:33.931 --> 32:37.700
And I know I acted crazy.

32:37.734 --> 32:39.769
But the thought of... of
you dating someone else?

32:39.803 --> 32:41.804
It drove me crazy.

32:41.838 --> 32:44.073
Because...

32:44.107 --> 32:46.943
I-I wanna be exclusive.

32:49.413 --> 32:51.614
Well, why didn't you just
say that?

32:51.648 --> 32:54.150
I didn't even want
to go on a date with that guy.

32:54.184 --> 32:56.519
I don't want you going
on dates with anyone.

32:56.553 --> 32:58.988
Except you, I hope.

32:59.022 --> 33:01.023
- Except me.
- Yeah.

33:03.059 --> 33:05.294
Is that okay?

33:05.328 --> 33:06.996
If we're exclusive?

33:26.249 --> 33:29.852
Okay, Deb, are you
gonna say it or am I?

33:29.886 --> 33:31.754
We need to talk about our kids.

33:31.788 --> 33:34.890
Yes. Absolutely.

33:34.924 --> 33:36.358
I'm so relieved.

33:36.392 --> 33:38.861
I have been
standing here, stewing,

33:38.895 --> 33:40.996
wanting to get this
off my chest.

33:41.030 --> 33:43.398
I'm so glad you're as worried
about it as I am.

33:43.433 --> 33:44.967
Well, if we wanna make things
work between us,

33:45.001 --> 33:46.301
something has to be done.

33:46.336 --> 33:48.470
Right. Good.

33:48.504 --> 33:51.573
So what are you gonna do
about Carrie and Dorrit?

33:51.608 --> 33:53.242
What?

33:53.276 --> 33:54.910
That...

33:54.944 --> 33:57.412
that is what we're talking
about, isn't it?

33:58.815 --> 34:02.084
They were really mean to Dylan.
You saw that, right?

34:03.186 --> 34:04.553
You're serious?

34:04.587 --> 34:06.254
Tom.

34:06.289 --> 34:10.257
Obviously, your girls
are a <i>little</i> immature.

34:10.293 --> 34:13.562
Talking about wedgies?

34:13.596 --> 34:15.897
Now I'm... I'm not calling you
a bad parent.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.331
I-I'm just saying,

34:17.366 --> 34:20.034
we need to make sure
this never happens again.

34:20.069 --> 34:21.369
<i>My</i> girls are immature?

34:21.404 --> 34:22.904
Your son got on the phone

34:22.938 --> 34:24.672
when I was in the middle
of a business call,

34:24.706 --> 34:27.976
- and made fart noises. He...
- Shh!

34:28.010 --> 34:29.777
Tom,
he's right in the next room.

34:29.812 --> 34:31.980
You're gonna hurt his feelings.

34:32.014 --> 34:35.250
And also, he's 11.

34:35.284 --> 34:39.087
Your girls are 15 and 17,
and they should know better.

34:39.121 --> 34:41.989
I can't believe you're making
excuses for his behavior.

34:42.024 --> 34:43.725
And I can't believe
you can't handle

34:43.759 --> 34:45.693
the littlest bit
of constructive criticism

34:45.728 --> 34:46.960
about your daughters.

34:46.996 --> 34:48.463
You know what?

34:52.134 --> 34:55.402
I think maybe we need to have
a bigger discussion.

34:58.340 --> 35:01.910
I don't know how my dad is gonna
work it out with Deb,

35:01.944 --> 35:03.511
or how I can ever see
that kid again

35:03.546 --> 35:05.146
and not knee him in the nuts.

35:06.782 --> 35:09.350
I'll tell you who surprised me,
though... my sister.

35:09.385 --> 35:11.953
Sleeping with her boyfriend
in your bed?

35:11.987 --> 35:14.122
Oy. Don't remind me.

35:14.156 --> 35:16.090
Dorrit and I had been fighting,

35:16.125 --> 35:19.994
but then we bonded
when we had this common enemy.

35:20.029 --> 35:22.864
There we were,
working together.

35:22.898 --> 35:24.165
It just was nice to see

35:24.199 --> 35:27.602
we could still be sisters united
when we needed to be.

35:27.636 --> 35:29.937
You know?

35:29.972 --> 35:33.875
I never had anything like that
with my brother.

35:33.909 --> 35:36.510
Never?

35:36.545 --> 35:39.013
I-I know you're not supposed to
speak ill of the dead,

35:39.047 --> 35:41.682
but... as far as my brother
was concerned,

35:41.717 --> 35:43.384
I was the competition.

35:43.418 --> 35:45.753
He... he pretty much lived
to put me down.

35:47.389 --> 35:49.690
Well, he probably just thought
you were better than him

35:49.725 --> 35:51.058
and felt threatened.

35:51.093 --> 35:53.194
Oh, I was never a threat.

35:53.228 --> 35:55.529
I mean, Robby always got
all the attention.

35:55.564 --> 35:57.331
You know, the golden boy.

35:57.365 --> 35:59.066
The star athlete,
great student,

35:59.101 --> 36:02.036
totally full of himself.

36:02.070 --> 36:05.005
And I was just
his stupid little brother.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.309
No one seemed... no one seemed
to care about me,

36:08.343 --> 36:09.476
or even noticed me.

36:13.114 --> 36:15.883
And... now he's dead,

36:15.917 --> 36:18.552
and I got famous
writing a play about him.

36:20.488 --> 36:23.991
Death equals a Tony,
so they say.

36:25.193 --> 36:28.128
I mean,
his... his death made me,

36:28.163 --> 36:30.764
and I don't even miss him.

36:30.799 --> 36:33.767
All I feel is good,

36:33.802 --> 36:36.136
that finally...

36:37.572 --> 36:40.541
Finally people are noticing me.

36:44.612 --> 36:47.581
That kind of makes me
a monster, doesn't it?

36:49.117 --> 36:50.817
I am.
I'm... I'm a monster.

36:50.852 --> 36:52.753
No.

36:52.787 --> 36:55.756
No, you're not.

36:55.790 --> 36:57.424
You're not, okay?

36:57.458 --> 36:59.426
You aren't.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.727
You aren't.

37:00.762 --> 37:03.430
<i>As Weaver's emotional walls</i>
<i>tumbled,</i>

37:03.464 --> 37:06.199
<i>I knew I could never write</i>
<i>his story.</i>

37:07.657 --> 37:10.373
For what it's worth, dad,
I really did like Deb.

37:10.493 --> 37:12.494
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

37:12.528 --> 37:14.295
Me, too.
She was pretty cool.

37:14.330 --> 37:15.597
Thanks.

37:15.631 --> 37:17.298
Yeah, there's just no way
that I could be with someone

37:17.333 --> 37:19.567
who was that delusional
about her own kid.

37:19.602 --> 37:22.503
But don't think that means I'm
letting you two off the hook.

37:22.538 --> 37:25.607
What really happened upstairs?
Spill.

37:25.641 --> 37:29.344
We might've told him we were
gonna give him a wedgie.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.979
A <i>really</i> bad one.

37:31.013 --> 37:32.814
But he totally deserved it.

37:32.848 --> 37:34.749
He was going through
my underwear drawer.

37:34.783 --> 37:36.784
And he asked to look at
our private parts.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.453
Okay, okay, okay.

37:38.487 --> 37:40.922
Look, I know that
you two aren't perfect,

37:40.956 --> 37:43.157
and I am not the best dad
on earth.

37:43.192 --> 37:46.060
But let's face it.
That kid was a complete jackass.

37:47.663 --> 37:49.330
And a wedgie is a perfectly
acceptable punishment

37:49.364 --> 37:50.431
for that kind of behavior.

37:54.937 --> 37:57.071
Hello?

37:57.105 --> 37:59.640
It's Jeremy from Credit Suisse.

37:59.675 --> 38:01.208
Jeremy.

38:01.243 --> 38:02.810
One sec.

38:02.844 --> 38:04.879
Jeremy, hi. Hi.

38:04.913 --> 38:08.783
I-I've been, um,
meaning to call to apologize.

38:08.817 --> 38:10.951
Yes. I heard Harvey had
quite the call with you.

38:10.986 --> 38:13.854
Yeah. I-I could not be
more embarrassed.

38:13.889 --> 38:15.756
Um, I tried calling him
several times,

38:15.791 --> 38:17.324
but I guess he... he must've
left the office.

38:17.359 --> 38:19.527
Now listen,
I'm sure you're rethinking

38:19.561 --> 38:21.662
your decision to go with us,
but I promise you,

38:21.696 --> 38:24.131
I could not be more committed
to the account.

38:24.166 --> 38:26.300
Tom, don't worry.
I'm not mad. I get it.

38:26.334 --> 38:28.602
I have a total
pain in the ass son, too.

38:28.637 --> 38:30.804
Oh. You do?

38:30.839 --> 38:32.773
Yes. Threw a firecracker
at my boss' dog

38:32.807 --> 38:34.341
at his 4th of July party.

38:34.376 --> 38:36.677
We oughta get our horrible boys
together sometimes.

38:36.711 --> 38:37.911
Okay, that sounds great.

38:37.946 --> 38:39.647
We'll, uh, we'll take 'em
to a game or something.

38:39.681 --> 38:41.215
Great idea.

38:41.249 --> 38:42.716
I'll check with my secretary

38:42.751 --> 38:43.717
and set up a date.

38:43.752 --> 38:45.319
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

38:45.353 --> 38:47.388
Well, you bring your son,

38:47.422 --> 38:49.823
and I'll bring... my son.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.528
Okay. All right, great.
I'll talk to you soon.

38:58.533 --> 39:01.602
Do you have any idea where
I might rent a 12-year-old

39:01.636 --> 39:03.303
to pretend to be my kid?

39:03.338 --> 39:04.304
Uh...

39:04.339 --> 39:05.873
Way to establish boundaries
there, dad.

39:05.907 --> 39:08.709
I think we might need to get
an unlisted number.

39:14.916 --> 39:16.450
Hey, you're back.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.485
What happened? Did you get
bored with your bimbo?

39:18.519 --> 39:20.721
No. My dad came home,

39:20.755 --> 39:22.356
not that it's
any of your business.

39:22.390 --> 39:24.091
You kind of made it
my business.

39:24.125 --> 39:26.426
No, I didn't. You just
showed up at my house.

39:26.461 --> 39:28.595
Whatever.
You weren't exactly hiding it.

39:28.629 --> 39:30.697
Are you gonna tell Carrie?

39:30.731 --> 39:33.567
I haven't made up my mind yet.

39:33.601 --> 39:36.870
I'm still in love with her,
and I don't want to hurt her.

39:36.904 --> 39:38.805
You're still in love?

39:38.925 --> 39:40.521
You have a funny way of showing it.

39:40.641 --> 39:41.942
You of all people should know

39:41.976 --> 39:43.944
life is more complicated
than that.

39:43.978 --> 39:46.446
Well, my complications
are over.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.983
I'm ready to be with somebody
my own age.

39:54.355 --> 39:55.588
Carrie!

39:55.623 --> 39:56.923
How's my article coming?

39:56.957 --> 39:58.691
What has your pillow talk
revealed?

39:58.726 --> 40:00.460
Secret siblings?
Drug problem?

40:00.494 --> 40:02.062
I'm dying to read it, darling!

40:02.096 --> 40:05.899
Actually, I... decided
not to finish the piece.

40:05.933 --> 40:07.167
Ohh.

40:07.201 --> 40:09.269
He wouldn't tell you anything.
 Yeah.

40:09.303 --> 40:11.938
Okay, just...
Just keep trying.

40:11.972 --> 40:13.873
No, he told me plenty.

40:13.908 --> 40:17.610
Uh, but none of it's stuff
I'd feel comfortable revealing.

40:17.645 --> 40:20.079
Why on earth not?

40:21.749 --> 40:25.018
Because I actually feel
like I might like him.

40:26.987 --> 40:28.121
Opportunities like this

40:28.155 --> 40:30.823
don't just fall into your lap,
you know.

40:30.858 --> 40:31.958
I offered you a place to <i>write,</i>

40:31.992 --> 40:33.993
and you're gonna give it up
for a boy?

40:34.028 --> 40:35.495
The world is full of boys.

40:35.529 --> 40:37.263
I know.

40:37.297 --> 40:40.666
But don't worry.
I-I'm not giving anything up.

40:40.701 --> 40:43.636
- I still have tons of ideas to pitch to you.
- You know what?

40:43.670 --> 40:45.204
I just don't think it's gonna
happen for you right now.

40:45.239 --> 40:47.640

a cappuccino, will you?

40:47.674 --> 40:51.344
