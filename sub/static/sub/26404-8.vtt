00:00.070 --> 00:01.585
<i>Previously on "Station 19"...</i>

00:01.609 --> 00:03.375
Windstorm's on the way.
It's supposed to get pretty ugly.

00:03.425 --> 00:04.679
Warrant was issued this morning.

00:04.703 --> 00:05.788
So, what are you gonna do?

00:05.813 --> 00:07.102
I've never seen myself as a person

00:07.203 --> 00:08.568
who will ever actually get married.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.400
- Hey! Sorry!
- Screw you!

00:10.447 --> 00:11.652
Hey, Gibson... enough!

00:11.722 --> 00:13.324
When did this start?
Right after the skyscraper?

00:13.355 --> 00:14.371
Let me sleep!

00:14.406 --> 00:16.406
Shannon, let's take care
of your leg, okay?

00:18.710 --> 00:20.610
- Still no service.
- We won't be safe here much longer.

00:20.712 --> 00:22.579
Screw dispatch.
We got to get out of here.

00:22.681 --> 00:25.215
Maya Bishop will be promoted
to Lieutenant.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.217
There's an opening at Station 23.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.853
- <i>Hey, it's Andy.</i>
- Where are you? Call me.

<i>When you've crashed and burned,
you might wonder,</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:51.774
<i>"How did I get here?"</i>

00:53.145 --> 00:54.144
Herrera.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.412
Herrera, wake up.

00:56.481 --> 00:58.982
<i>But that part doesn't really matter.</i>

00:59.084 --> 01:01.284
<i>What matters is what you do next.</i>

01:01.386 --> 01:02.819
We were in a crash.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.187
Herrera.

01:04.289 --> 01:06.723
- Hey. You with me?
- I'm here. I'm here.

01:06.825 --> 01:08.658
<i>Will you let it overwhelm you...</i>

01:08.724 --> 01:09.759
How long was I out?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.094
Couple minutes, I think.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.795
Little longer than me.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.132
We have a couple problems.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.233
<i>...or will you rise?</i>

01:17.335 --> 01:18.501
Shannon?

01:18.570 --> 01:19.802
Are you all right back there?

01:19.905 --> 01:20.937
Yeah.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.972
I feel sort of...

01:23.074 --> 01:24.807
like, outside of my body.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.544
I'm pinned pretty good here.

01:27.646 --> 01:30.346
I... can't... get good leverage.

01:30.415 --> 01:31.981
I'll help. Just...
Just give me a minute.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.683
Is anyone else cold?

01:33.785 --> 01:35.885
Because I am.

01:35.959 --> 01:36.986
Cold...

01:37.055 --> 01:39.189
Okay. Let's say all the things aloud

01:39.291 --> 01:41.191
so we understand
what we're dealing with here.

01:41.259 --> 01:42.825
You're pinned.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.427
Shannon's leg needs a hospital.

01:44.529 --> 01:46.362
We're stuck. On our side.

01:46.431 --> 01:48.031
In a ravine.

01:48.099 --> 01:49.666
During a windstorm.

01:49.768 --> 01:50.900
We can't call for help,

01:51.002 --> 01:53.636
and no one even knows we're out here.

02:06.184 --> 02:08.251
It's driving me crazy
I can't check in with Miranda.

02:08.353 --> 02:09.852
I can't get ahold of Andy, either.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.287
She'll check in
when they get to a landline.

02:11.389 --> 02:12.989
Yeah, nobody's got any signal right now.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.557
But, Bishop, you made Lieutenant.

02:14.659 --> 02:16.392
Savor it.

02:16.494 --> 02:18.127
Fall into the warm embrace
of these mashed potatoes.

02:18.152 --> 02:19.206
Mm-hmm.

02:19.231 --> 02:21.898
I made Lieutenant at Station 23.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.384
- The people there are...
- The worst.

02:23.485 --> 02:24.601
- Meatheads.
- Unshowered.

02:24.703 --> 02:26.269
Thanks, guys. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

02:26.371 --> 02:27.423
They are.

02:27.472 --> 02:29.172
I mean, you have
actual knowledge about 23.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.141
- Dish, please.
- Nothing to dish.

02:32.244 --> 02:33.576
You were seeing
what's-his-name over there.

02:33.678 --> 02:35.011
- Oh, um...
- Mayhorn!

02:35.113 --> 02:36.179
- Mayhorn.
- Mayhorn.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.081
Okay.

02:38.183 --> 02:39.215
You were seeing Mayhorn?

02:39.317 --> 02:40.850
"Seeing" is a strong word.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.452
I saw him once.

02:42.554 --> 02:44.954
- Thought you said it was three times.
- Oh. All right.

02:45.056 --> 02:47.657
You know what? It was a month
or so ago, and it was nothing.

02:47.759 --> 02:49.559
Not... that there's any reason

02:49.661 --> 02:50.893
for any of you to need that information.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.229
- Never mind.
- Me. I need information.

02:53.331 --> 02:54.664
Mayhorn likes 23, right?

02:54.766 --> 02:57.267
I mean, tell me all the reasons
he likes 23.

02:58.837 --> 02:59.869
I'm sorry. I got nothing.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.904
Where's Gibson?
He's gonna want a drumstick.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.773
I believe he's, uh, resting.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.174
I'll fix him a plate.

03:05.277 --> 03:07.043
You don't want to see Hangry Jack.

03:11.082 --> 03:13.916
Hey, how is Gibson lately?

03:14.019 --> 03:15.318
Does he seem on edge to you?

03:15.420 --> 03:16.819
- You noticed?
- Kind of hard not to notice

03:16.921 --> 03:18.554
when he's throwing Greg Tanner
against a wall

03:18.657 --> 03:19.889
over a poker game.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.090
I'm worried.

03:21.192 --> 03:22.625
Is he getting enough sleep lately?

03:22.727 --> 03:24.227
Odd hours, for sure, but I didn't think

03:24.329 --> 03:25.862
he was bringing all that to the Station.

03:25.964 --> 03:29.299
I've seen this many times
before. It's dangerous.

03:29.401 --> 03:31.501
And it likely won't resolve on its own.

03:31.603 --> 03:32.669
So, what do we do?

03:38.143 --> 03:39.976
I'm just worried
about sticking around here.

03:40.078 --> 03:41.277
You gotta turn me in.

03:41.379 --> 03:43.346
- I've caused enough trouble.
- You're right.

03:43.448 --> 03:44.547
You agree with me?

03:46.584 --> 03:49.252
First time in a long time, huh?

03:49.354 --> 03:52.188
But... storm's not over yet.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.290
We're still grounded.
Can't do anything this minute.

03:55.327 --> 03:56.693
Come on.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.565
Poor Herrera, stuck on Aid Car duty

04:02.667 --> 04:04.701
and missing out
on all this confectionery glory.

04:04.803 --> 04:06.269
Do you... want to get married?

04:08.006 --> 04:08.971
To you?

04:09.074 --> 04:10.473
Or ever?

04:10.575 --> 04:12.308
I mean, are you pro-marriage
or anti-marriage?

04:12.410 --> 04:14.077
Is being anti-marriage
even a real thing?

04:14.179 --> 04:15.845
Marriage isn't everyone's endgame.

04:15.947 --> 04:19.749
Yeah, see, I don't... I don't get that.

04:19.851 --> 04:21.517
Being married to Michael was great.

04:21.619 --> 04:24.053
Why wouldn't... Grant want that?

04:24.155 --> 04:26.522
Well, there is such a thing
as too much too soon.

04:26.624 --> 04:27.590
Relax.

04:27.692 --> 04:29.559
Live in the now. Forget about the later.

04:32.764 --> 04:34.597
Hey. Can we chat for a minute?

04:34.699 --> 04:35.732
Sure.

04:40.271 --> 04:41.437
Okay.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.273
Almost there.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.611
Shannon? How you doing back there?

04:48.713 --> 04:51.214
Oh, just peachy.

04:51.316 --> 04:52.348
You guys?

04:52.450 --> 04:54.817
We're, uh... Yeah. We're peachy, too.

04:56.488 --> 04:58.521
You have concussion symptoms?

04:58.623 --> 05:00.590
Nausea? Dizziness?

05:00.692 --> 05:02.892
Only a slight headache.

05:05.497 --> 05:06.562
Okay.

05:06.664 --> 05:08.765
Once I'm unpinned,
I'll go for help, all right?

05:08.867 --> 05:10.032
Set up some flares.

05:10.135 --> 05:13.803
And you'll monitor her leg,
minimize the bleeding.

05:13.905 --> 05:14.971
Okay.

05:15.073 --> 05:17.640
We do all that, we're good to go.

05:17.742 --> 05:19.575
Okay, here we go.

05:21.346 --> 05:22.478
Okay.

05:22.580 --> 05:23.813
Okay. Let me help you down.

05:23.915 --> 05:25.148
- Wait.
- Let's go. It's time to move.

05:25.216 --> 05:26.616
Andy, wait. I can't.
We just agreed that...

05:26.718 --> 05:28.151
I can't move my legs.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.653
I can't even feel them.

05:32.257 --> 05:33.423
I can't feel them.

05:41.224 --> 05:43.090
Can you wiggle your toes?

05:43.192 --> 05:44.725
You tell me.

05:47.163 --> 05:48.282
It could be temporary.

05:48.345 --> 05:49.912
You know, it's probably temporary.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.282
All right, I'm gonna take a look
at your eyes, Shannon, okay?

05:53.350 --> 05:55.684
It could be swelling around your spine.

05:55.753 --> 05:56.808
That will go away.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.754
Or nerve damage, which can heal, or...

05:58.856 --> 06:00.589
Or I have a significant spinal injury

06:00.691 --> 06:01.886
and may never walk again.

06:01.947 --> 06:02.960
We're jumping the gun here.

06:03.046 --> 06:04.960
We're not specialists.
We can't diagnose you.

06:05.008 --> 06:06.040
My back's on fire.

06:06.109 --> 06:07.875
When I'm done here,
I'll grab you some Fent.

06:07.944 --> 06:09.410
Equal, round, and reactive.
That's great.

06:09.479 --> 06:11.545
- Doesn't feel too great.
- I know, I'm sorry,

06:11.608 --> 06:13.281
but that's normal
after all you went through...

06:13.383 --> 06:16.050
compartment syndrome and a fasciotomy.

06:16.119 --> 06:17.919
I'll grab you some pain meds, too.

06:19.789 --> 06:21.422
Did you lose consciousness
at all, Shannon?

06:21.491 --> 06:24.025
No. I was awake for the whole thing.

06:24.127 --> 06:25.693
Wouldn't want to do that again.

06:25.762 --> 06:27.895
Well, your vitals are good,
you didn't lose consciousness.

06:27.931 --> 06:29.697
That's all good news.
You're a tough cookie.

06:29.766 --> 06:31.434
- Yay.
- No likely concussion.

06:31.473 --> 06:33.113
Her C-Collar must have
protected her head.

06:33.194 --> 06:34.994
- How's your headache?
- The same.

06:35.054 --> 06:36.387
What about you?

06:36.456 --> 06:38.456
You know, you're more
susceptible to drowsiness,

06:38.524 --> 06:40.391
on pain meds and lying down like that.

06:40.460 --> 06:42.260
You were out longer.

06:42.328 --> 06:44.462
You could easily have an
intracranial bleed or something.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.197
I know, but unless
there's a brain surgeon

06:46.266 --> 06:49.233
wandering around out there,
not much we can do about that.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.570
I've got some re-perfusion here.

06:52.639 --> 06:54.923
- A good amount of re-perfusion.
- Copy.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.884
I'm gonna irrigate and re-dress
your leg wound, okay?

06:56.943 --> 06:57.909
Okay, thanks.

06:57.977 --> 06:59.410
Then I'll locate the flares

06:59.479 --> 07:01.412
and hike up to the road for help...

07:03.128 --> 07:04.081
Oh, no.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.316
Talk to me. What's happening?

07:05.385 --> 07:07.451
Uh, just a little smoke
coming from the engine.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.053
I'm on it.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.957
You hate inventory that much?

07:12.992 --> 07:15.660
No, just trying to overcome
this Friendsgiving food baby

07:15.728 --> 07:18.362
while distracting myself
with work and groaning.

07:18.464 --> 07:19.697
Groaning helps.

07:19.799 --> 07:20.731
I got service briefly,

07:20.833 --> 07:23.167
and a text came in from my buddy Karev.

07:23.269 --> 07:24.869
Grey-Sloan lost electricity

07:24.938 --> 07:27.672
and Miranda is trapped in an elevator.

07:27.740 --> 07:28.940
I'm worried out of my mind.

07:29.008 --> 07:31.008
I know we're on a sabbatical, but...

07:31.077 --> 07:32.310
she's trapped in an elevator.

07:32.378 --> 07:34.478
I'm sure she's busy rocking
the whole superhero vibes

07:34.547 --> 07:35.646
that she got going on.

07:35.715 --> 07:38.282
Prying open elevator doors,
doing whatever it takes.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.918
She's Dr. B. She's fine.

07:40.987 --> 07:42.787
I just... I just wish
I knew she was fine.

07:42.889 --> 07:45.690
Like I said, groaning helps.

07:46.859 --> 07:47.892
Yeah.

08:09.415 --> 08:11.215
Smoke's out.

08:11.284 --> 08:13.384
<i>How are the conditions out there?</i>

08:15.021 --> 08:17.521
Uh...

08:17.623 --> 08:19.090
challenging.

08:26.199 --> 08:27.631
Hey.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.501
The, uh, team's looking for an update.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.470
HQ's working to get reception back up.

08:32.538 --> 08:34.304
The wind's still 85 miles per hour.

08:34.374 --> 08:35.416
The calls are prioritized

08:35.441 --> 08:36.841
so we know exactly which to hit first.

08:36.871 --> 08:37.852
Okay.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.611
Thanks... for the update.

08:40.712 --> 08:41.912
So, uh...

08:43.649 --> 08:45.116
...Mayhorn, huh?

08:45.184 --> 08:47.518
- Okay...
- Hughes? There you are.

08:47.553 --> 08:50.021
So, I'll be sure to disseminate
that info to the team, Chief.

08:50.123 --> 08:51.655
Do me a favor and round up Montgomery

08:51.758 --> 08:53.657
and meet me in the Beanery.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.127
This was the best stuffing
I've ever had.

08:56.195 --> 08:57.495
Better than Mom's.

08:57.597 --> 08:59.296
Don't tell her that.

08:59.365 --> 09:01.332
As much as I hate to remind you,

09:01.434 --> 09:03.834
you are harboring a fugitive here.

09:03.903 --> 09:05.669
Can I ask you something?

09:05.772 --> 09:07.104
Shoot.

09:07.173 --> 09:08.272
That one Christmas,

09:08.341 --> 09:10.875
we had way more stuff than other years.

09:10.943 --> 09:12.143
How'd you pull that off?

09:13.746 --> 09:15.880
I was about to file for bankruptcy,

09:15.948 --> 09:19.050
so I figured, why not liquidate
on gifts for my family?

09:19.118 --> 09:20.951
What about those two months
you were driving

09:21.054 --> 09:24.588
that baby blue Cadillac Seville,
and then it was just gone?

09:24.657 --> 09:27.058
Yeah. I was just, um, holding that.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.426
Ah.

09:28.528 --> 09:30.327
- Holding it, huh?
- Yes.

09:30.396 --> 09:32.029
For some friends.

09:32.131 --> 09:33.568
Why the sudden curiosity?

09:33.662 --> 09:36.467
I don't know. I'm just...

09:36.536 --> 09:38.636
not sure when
we'll see each other again.

09:43.109 --> 09:45.843
For real, though,
you want some more stuffing?

09:45.945 --> 09:47.178
I'm good.

09:57.056 --> 09:58.656
Pruitt wants to see us in the Beanery.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.324
Would you like to...
to get a seat at Reception?

10:00.426 --> 10:01.892
Yeah. I'll do that.

10:03.262 --> 10:05.429
What did Pruitt want to see us about?

10:05.498 --> 10:06.630
No clue.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.467
But he probably doesn't want
to see man-bits. Zip up.

10:09.569 --> 10:11.635
Sorry, I was... We were...

10:11.737 --> 10:13.571
Oh. No. No, I connected those dots.

10:13.673 --> 10:14.872
But I was trying to talk to him,

10:14.941 --> 10:16.740
and then you got into my head
about living in the now,

10:16.776 --> 10:18.576
and the now that I wanted to live in
was less about talking

10:18.644 --> 10:20.144
- and more about...
- Man-bits! I got it. All good.

10:20.246 --> 10:21.789
Not all good! We needed to talk.

10:21.859 --> 10:23.781
But instead, you had
hotty hot spur-of-the-moment

10:23.883 --> 10:25.182
sexy time because of me.

10:25.251 --> 10:27.084
So you're welcome.

10:30.790 --> 10:33.991
The engine's all good,
so we don't need to evacuate.

10:34.093 --> 10:35.493
Do you need more Fent?

10:35.561 --> 10:36.927
I'm fine.

10:36.996 --> 10:38.762
How steep was that climb out there?

10:38.865 --> 10:41.265
I'm guessing 65 degrees, maybe 70.

10:41.334 --> 10:43.300
That's almost unclimbable without gear.

10:43.369 --> 10:45.035
I have to try. Once I find the flares...

10:45.104 --> 10:47.638
My leg is kind of throbbing now.

10:47.707 --> 10:49.206
I'm upping her pain meds.

10:54.714 --> 10:55.913
Heart rate's erratic.

10:55.982 --> 10:58.149
Her leg needs re-dressing.
She needs to be monitored.

10:58.217 --> 10:59.917
That settles that.

10:59.986 --> 11:01.085
You stay here.

11:01.154 --> 11:02.186
For now.

11:02.255 --> 11:04.555
Until her heart rate evens out.

11:04.657 --> 11:05.656
It's our only option.

11:11.130 --> 11:14.665
Well, my wife is no longer
trapped in an elevator.

11:14.734 --> 11:16.267
That's good, right?

11:16.335 --> 11:18.502
Yeah, what's not good is
that she never even mentioned

11:18.604 --> 11:20.504
being trapped in the first place.

11:20.606 --> 11:21.805
We're in a windstorm!

11:21.874 --> 11:23.974
Lines are down, trees are falling.

11:24.043 --> 11:27.144
I am still her husband,
I still worry, and I should...

11:27.246 --> 11:28.612
I should know these things.

11:28.681 --> 11:30.481
Has it dawned on you
that maybe that's how she feels

11:30.583 --> 11:32.249
when you come home from work every day

11:32.351 --> 11:34.185
and tell her about
all the dangerous things

11:34.253 --> 11:36.287
that you survived at work that day?

11:38.057 --> 11:40.024
Great. You're all here. Now listen up.

11:40.126 --> 11:41.458
He seems mad. Why does he seem mad?

11:41.561 --> 11:42.660
Because I am mad.

11:42.762 --> 11:44.562
Because the firefighters
standing in front of me

11:44.664 --> 11:46.397
are not the firefighters I raised.

11:46.499 --> 11:49.099
The firefighters I raised communicate.

11:49.202 --> 11:51.202
They have each other's backs.

11:52.471 --> 11:55.022
And when one of our own
shows clear signs of struggling,

11:55.100 --> 11:56.140
we help.

11:56.242 --> 11:59.944
Because if we don't,
it puts civilian lives at risk.

12:01.714 --> 12:03.581
There's something wrong with Gibson.

12:03.683 --> 12:06.050
And I suspect all of you have
noticed that something's off.

12:06.152 --> 12:09.320
Hell, I've been here half a day,
and I could tell you that.

12:09.422 --> 12:12.823
A sleep-deprived, troubled
firefighter is a liability.

12:12.925 --> 12:15.392
Snap out of it.

12:15.494 --> 12:17.228
Help isn't just gonna magically appear.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.029
It's on us to do something about it.

12:20.570 --> 12:21.593
Right now.

12:29.798 --> 12:31.931
Radio case is crushed.

12:31.966 --> 12:33.920
If it's a loose fuse,
maybe I can tighten it.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.554
Who identifies the bodies?

12:35.607 --> 12:37.206
When people die out in the woods?

12:37.264 --> 12:38.830
Nobody's dying here today, okay?

12:38.899 --> 12:40.966
Who usually does it, though?

12:41.034 --> 12:42.768
Like, my Gammy's all I have,

12:42.870 --> 12:45.337
so she'd probably have to do it, right?

12:45.405 --> 12:47.439
She's 89.

12:47.474 --> 12:49.407
God, that might kill her.

12:49.476 --> 12:51.843
Hey, y-you don't... you don't
have to think about that.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.678
I'm asking because...

12:55.582 --> 12:59.384
I want to be wearing the necklace
she gave me if it happens.

12:59.486 --> 13:00.786
I mean, If I'm not wearing it,

13:00.854 --> 13:03.789
she'll think
that I don't like it, and...

13:03.857 --> 13:05.457
she's really sensitive
about stuff like that,

13:05.526 --> 13:07.125
and I-I...

13:07.194 --> 13:09.995
I just want to make her
feel good so that maybe...

13:12.032 --> 13:14.699
...maybe if I am dead...

13:14.735 --> 13:16.568
it won't kill her.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.671
Shannon, this is what we do. Okay?

13:19.740 --> 13:23.842
We face impossible situations,
and we overcome them, okay?

13:23.871 --> 13:24.943
Okay.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.578
Damn it.

13:26.613 --> 13:28.598
The motherboard is fried.
There's no fixing this thing.

13:30.417 --> 13:33.318
So, let's see if we can fix you, okay?

13:33.420 --> 13:34.619
Okay.

13:35.455 --> 13:37.622
You're bleeding a lot more
than I'd like.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.357
It's time for a re-dress.

13:41.395 --> 13:43.628
Wind's starting to die down.

13:43.697 --> 13:46.031
Ry, you've been a gracious host.

13:46.099 --> 13:47.165
I appreciate it.

13:47.267 --> 13:50.368
And it's time for you to turn me in now.

13:50.437 --> 13:54.372
There's this really beautiful
maple tree out there.

13:54.408 --> 13:58.310
Funny. I've never really
stared at one before.

13:58.378 --> 14:00.412
At a... At a maple tree?

14:00.480 --> 14:03.048
There's a bunch of maple trees
by that bus station on 10th.

14:03.116 --> 14:06.251
It's... It's a pretty quick walk
from here, actually.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.986
I know what you're doing.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.554
This is my mess.

14:09.623 --> 14:10.889
It's time for me to face it.

14:10.958 --> 14:13.525
I bet buses will start
running again soon.

14:13.594 --> 14:15.627
Storm's gonna keep the cruisers
busy for a while

14:15.696 --> 14:17.929
before they go out
on any kind of regular patrol.

14:20.367 --> 14:21.967
The thing I really like
about maple trees

14:22.035 --> 14:23.602
is how tough they are.

14:24.638 --> 14:28.073
They can survive
almost anything, but still,

14:28.108 --> 14:31.710
there's... something about them
that just draws you in.

14:33.113 --> 14:34.713
Something nice.

14:36.383 --> 14:38.183
They can surprise you, you know?

15:06.613 --> 15:07.679
What the hell?

15:07.748 --> 15:10.815
Your concussion's making you groggy.

15:10.918 --> 15:13.118
You got to fight it, okay?

15:13.186 --> 15:14.386
Stay awake.

15:14.454 --> 15:16.855
I need something to focus on to...

15:16.924 --> 15:18.924
to keep me awake.

15:19.026 --> 15:20.625
- Talk to me.
- What about?

15:20.694 --> 15:21.960
I don't know. Do you have any pets?

15:22.029 --> 15:23.428
No.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.297
Me either.

15:25.399 --> 15:26.798
Any hobbies?

15:26.900 --> 15:28.133
I make smoothies.

15:28.201 --> 15:29.334
Already asleep.

15:31.838 --> 15:34.506
I don't know. Uh, talk to me...

15:36.643 --> 15:38.443
...about your wife.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.951
She loved roller skating.

15:47.688 --> 15:48.987
Roller skating?

15:49.056 --> 15:53.325
There was this rink in Auburn
where she liked to skate.

15:55.295 --> 15:57.595
So, that's where we had our first date.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.101
I think I would've
followed her anywhere.

16:05.138 --> 16:08.006
But out on that rink...

16:08.075 --> 16:09.341
I was ridiculous.

16:10.944 --> 16:15.180
Limbs flying everywhere,
bumping into the walls.

16:15.282 --> 16:17.282
No game.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.584
And somehow she married me, anyway.

16:22.122 --> 16:23.755
7 feet between you and the ground,

16:23.857 --> 16:26.858
with wheels glued to your feet...

16:26.893 --> 16:30.328
...it's terrifying.

16:32.065 --> 16:34.165
I'm lucky I never broke a...

16:36.636 --> 16:37.669
...broke a leg.

16:41.141 --> 16:45.176
After Claire's accident,
work was everything for me.

16:47.481 --> 16:48.780
Kept me sane.

16:51.251 --> 16:53.184
This job is keeping me sane.

16:54.654 --> 16:58.323
I don't know what I'll do if I can't...

16:58.392 --> 17:01.126
if my legs are...

17:01.228 --> 17:02.594
if they are...

17:05.598 --> 17:08.633
Andy, I-I don't know if I...

17:08.734 --> 17:10.201
If?

17:10.270 --> 17:14.372
If that's the case...
and that's a big "if"...

17:14.473 --> 17:16.107
there are other ways to help people.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.009
Y...

17:18.078 --> 17:19.144
You'll be okay.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.444
If the situation was reversed,

17:20.513 --> 17:22.446
if you were staring down the barrel

17:22.516 --> 17:24.648
of not doing this job w...

17:28.521 --> 17:29.954
...would you be?

17:31.525 --> 17:32.791
Would you be okay?

17:43.336 --> 17:45.770
She's in cardiac arrest.

17:45.872 --> 17:47.806
It could be an electrolyte imbalance.

17:49.076 --> 17:51.376
We'll make it through this...
all three of us.

17:51.478 --> 17:53.178
You hear me?

17:58.852 --> 18:00.185
- Damn it!
- Hey.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.820
Looks like we drew the short straw.

18:01.922 --> 18:03.855
We're on Friendsgiving cleanup duty.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.158
All right, come on.

18:17.437 --> 18:19.037
What's going on, Dean?

18:19.139 --> 18:20.705
Just hear us out, okay?

18:20.774 --> 18:23.074
Please, Jack. Sit.

18:26.213 --> 18:27.712
I'm good standing.

18:27.814 --> 18:29.414
- What is this?
- We're worried about you.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.349
Okay, does anybody want
to tell me what's going on?

18:31.451 --> 18:32.817
Let's talk about what's going on.

18:32.919 --> 18:35.220
I hear you haven't been sleeping much.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.921
What do you mean, you hear?

18:37.023 --> 18:38.490
You've all been talking about me?

18:38.592 --> 18:39.591
We're worried. That's all.

18:39.659 --> 18:40.925
Oh, you're worried, Bishop?

18:40.994 --> 18:43.228
I was joking about you
trying to take my job.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.063
That... That was a joke.

18:45.132 --> 18:46.898
Now you're trying
to tarnish my reputation?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.033
- Jack, come on. That's not fair.
- "That's not fair"?

18:49.102 --> 18:52.804
What's not fair is all of you
ambushing me, over what?

18:52.873 --> 18:54.239
A little irritability?

18:54.307 --> 18:56.975
Irritability? Jack, it appears
you're suffering from PTSD.

18:57.043 --> 18:58.476
Who the hell are you to determine that?

18:58.501 --> 18:59.511
You're not a doctor.

18:59.579 --> 19:01.079
- I am.
- Oh...

19:01.148 --> 19:03.047
Now, I don't know the details,
but I would recommend

19:03.116 --> 19:05.416
you talk to a professional
about those details.

19:05.485 --> 19:06.584
- I don't need that.
- You don't have to suffer through this...

19:06.686 --> 19:08.453
Who the hell are you to even say, huh?!

19:08.555 --> 19:10.255
You're... You're so healthy?

19:10.323 --> 19:12.123
You've been kicked out of your house.

19:12.225 --> 19:14.826
Dean, you've been kicked out
of your own family.

19:14.928 --> 19:16.261
And I... And I'm sorry, Captain.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.629
You don't even work here anymore!

19:17.697 --> 19:18.596
Hey, Gibson...

19:18.665 --> 19:20.031
And, Hughes, you of all people

19:20.100 --> 19:22.534
want to talk about
my deepest, darkest places

19:22.602 --> 19:23.902
in front of everyone?

19:23.970 --> 19:25.336
Everybody, we've got communication back.

19:25.405 --> 19:27.438
- We're officially un-grounded.
- Great.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.038
We can finally start taking calls

19:29.123 --> 19:30.549
and help people
that actually need help...

19:30.577 --> 19:31.876
Wait. There's more.

19:31.945 --> 19:34.546
Aid Car 19 never made it
to Rainier First hospital.

19:34.614 --> 19:36.114
No one's heard from them
in over an hour.

19:36.183 --> 19:37.949
Our first call out
is a Search and Rescue

19:38.051 --> 19:40.151
for Herrera, Sullivan,
and their patient.

19:40.253 --> 19:41.252
Let's go!

19:51.598 --> 19:53.198
Okay.

19:54.134 --> 19:56.301
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna find those road flares.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.735
I need to hike and get us some help.

19:57.837 --> 19:58.937
We decided you'd stay here.

19:59.005 --> 20:00.371
Yeah, but that was before Shannon coded.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.840
She's stable for now, but if
she codes again in the field,

20:02.943 --> 20:04.175
it'll be harder to get her back.

20:04.277 --> 20:05.910
She needs a hospital.

20:05.979 --> 20:08.213
This is my window, while she's
stable, to go set the flares.

20:08.315 --> 20:09.714
It's more dangerous in the dark.

20:09.749 --> 20:12.183
The winds have quieted.
That'll make the climb safer.

20:12.285 --> 20:14.252
Plus, in the dark,
the flares are more visible.

20:14.354 --> 20:16.387
Smashed... soaked.

20:16.489 --> 20:19.123
The... These all got destroyed
in the crash.

20:21.194 --> 20:22.493
I got one that's still viable.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.329
This'll burn for 30 minutes at least.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.763
- I'm going.
- Wait.

20:25.865 --> 20:28.600
Rainier First will have noticed
we didn't arrive by now.

20:28.702 --> 20:29.667
Help will come.

20:29.736 --> 20:31.102
Shannon doesn't have that kind of time.

20:31.204 --> 20:32.337
She's already crashed once.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.938
Chances of it happening again are high,

20:34.040 --> 20:35.840
and again, and again after that,

20:35.942 --> 20:38.017
and without electrolytes,
that'll kill her.

20:38.088 --> 20:40.545
- You know that.
- Then you have to climb carefully.

20:40.647 --> 20:43.314
If you lose consciousness
or if you get hurt...

20:43.416 --> 20:45.250
If you fail...

20:45.318 --> 20:47.452
I won't be able to go out after you.

20:47.554 --> 20:49.287
Then I won't fail.

21:15.687 --> 21:16.926
No.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.470
No!

21:44.329 --> 21:45.912
Get up.

21:46.331 --> 21:47.964
Get up.

21:48.342 --> 21:51.768
Get... up.

21:53.939 --> 21:56.339
<i>Herrera, what's your status out there?</i>

21:57.876 --> 21:59.342
Still climbing.

22:05.717 --> 22:07.863
- Herrera!
- I have to get back to HQ.

22:07.941 --> 22:09.410
19 is currently without a Captain.

22:09.472 --> 22:11.509
Now, I hate to ask,
but can I rely on you

22:11.578 --> 22:13.211
to suit up as Interim Captain
on this call?

22:13.280 --> 22:14.846
I know it's your daughter out...

22:14.871 --> 22:15.885
All right.

22:22.622 --> 22:24.389
Let's go! Let's go!

22:24.424 --> 22:27.153
Stock that thing like it's an Aid Car.
Be prepared for anything.

22:27.197 --> 22:28.209
- Copy that.
- You got it.

22:28.244 --> 22:30.387
We're gonna retrace
the steps of the Aid Car

22:30.463 --> 22:33.965
all the way from the incident
site to Rainier First.

22:34.034 --> 22:35.438
- I'll drive.
- No, you won't.

22:35.514 --> 22:37.147
As Interim Captain, I'm benching you.

22:37.172 --> 22:39.094
From this call and all calls
until you get some help.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.272
That's insane. It's Andy out there.

22:40.341 --> 22:41.473
I'm your only Lieutenant here.

22:41.524 --> 22:44.409
I don't have time to explain
it to you gently. You're out.

22:44.477 --> 22:47.045
Bishop! You're up as Lieutenant.

22:47.113 --> 22:48.846
Whatever you need, sir.

22:48.915 --> 22:51.182
Unbelievable.

22:51.251 --> 22:53.217
Montgomery, stay with Gibson.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.385
Keep your eye on him.

22:54.487 --> 22:57.522
Everybody else, let's not keep
Andy waiting. Let's roll!

23:30.523 --> 23:31.889
Flare's set.

23:31.992 --> 23:33.925
We've got 30 minutes of burn time.

23:33.994 --> 23:35.360
I'm headed back.

23:39.265 --> 23:41.366
There's Jack's locker. He's gone.

23:41.395 --> 23:42.410
Damn it.

23:42.435 --> 23:43.468
I can't believe this.

23:46.106 --> 23:48.877
<i>- It's Jack. Leave a message.</i>
- Jack, hey, it's Travis.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.975
Please give me a call,
let me know you're all right.

23:51.036 --> 23:52.109
I'm gonna go.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.879
Give you... some time to cool down.

23:54.948 --> 23:57.382
Except there's a windstorm,
so I can't really go.

23:57.450 --> 23:58.783
Windstorm's basically over, so...

23:59.719 --> 24:01.252
Okay.

24:01.321 --> 24:03.421
Then... okay.

24:03.490 --> 24:04.522
Wait.

24:05.859 --> 24:07.058
You're right.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.360
There's something we should talk about.

24:13.867 --> 24:16.261
Trav, am I supposed to guess
what's on your mind here, or...?

24:16.286 --> 24:17.260
I'm upset.

24:17.285 --> 24:18.637
And I... And I don't want to be upset,

24:18.676 --> 24:20.027
so I keep trying not to think about it,

24:20.066 --> 24:21.572
but the more I try that,
the more upset I get.

24:21.641 --> 24:23.508
- About what?
- I like marriage!

24:23.576 --> 24:24.676
I had a great marriage,

24:24.744 --> 24:26.629
and I want another great one, sometime.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.059
I don't know when, but I just...

24:28.127 --> 24:30.828
You never told me that you were
so against the idea.

24:30.897 --> 24:31.996
Well, you also never asked.

24:32.065 --> 24:33.764
It's information
that you might want to know

24:33.833 --> 24:35.099
before you get close to someone.

24:35.168 --> 24:37.501
We don't all get to wear our
feelings on our finger, Trav.

24:37.570 --> 24:38.502
What's that supposed to mean?

24:38.571 --> 24:39.570
It means I don't have to share

24:39.639 --> 24:41.005
every single part of myself with you.

24:41.074 --> 24:42.540
We're talking about
the rest of our lives.

24:42.642 --> 24:44.408
I didn't realize
this was a thing for you.

24:45.678 --> 24:47.044
I need a minute.

24:47.146 --> 24:48.679
I think I really am gonna take a walk.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.047
You're gonna walk out
in the middle of this?

24:50.149 --> 24:51.349
Really, Michael?

24:56.222 --> 24:58.122
The name's Grant.

24:58.224 --> 24:59.490
Grant.

25:03.162 --> 25:04.929
This isn't working.

25:05.031 --> 25:06.898
Us.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.066
And I don't think...

25:09.135 --> 25:10.835
I don't think we can make this work.

25:10.904 --> 25:14.272
I mean, we can keep talking, but...

25:14.374 --> 25:16.741
something between us is just...

25:18.478 --> 25:19.944
...something's not right.

25:22.148 --> 25:24.215
I think you've felt that, too.

25:35.361 --> 25:37.028
Let's just keep our eyes
peeled for debris,

25:37.096 --> 25:38.663
skid marks... anything.

25:42.268 --> 25:44.502
The roads are a damn mess.
Everything is.

25:45.538 --> 25:48.005
Andy switched with me.
I mean, she took Aid Car.

25:48.942 --> 25:50.174
And now she's out here.

25:50.243 --> 25:52.643
Andy's smart, and Sullivan's
basically indestructible, right?

25:52.712 --> 25:54.812
They know how to survive.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.156
I just want to get to them.

26:05.258 --> 26:06.857
We all do.

26:16.769 --> 26:17.935
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

26:18.037 --> 26:19.537
Oh, not now.

26:19.605 --> 26:20.838
Ohh.

26:21.975 --> 26:23.240
Come on.

26:24.310 --> 26:25.843
Herrera, she's coding again.

26:25.912 --> 26:27.345
<i>I need you back here... fast.</i>

26:27.447 --> 26:28.579
I'm almost there!

26:28.681 --> 26:29.914
Do not move!

26:29.983 --> 26:32.717
You can't risk further paralysis
by disrupting your spine.

26:39.826 --> 26:42.159
Okay, Shannon, if you can hear me,

26:42.228 --> 26:44.628
you're gonna...

26:44.697 --> 26:47.164
you're gonna feel a shock.

26:47.266 --> 26:50.935
But y-your heart's gonna f-feel better.

26:58.111 --> 26:59.710
Oh, damn it!

27:01.614 --> 27:03.214
Defib's not an option.

27:04.450 --> 27:05.850
This is gonna hurt.

27:21.734 --> 27:23.000
What the hell are you doing?

27:23.102 --> 27:24.927
Precordial thump. This is my third one.

27:24.998 --> 27:26.342
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, stop!

27:30.910 --> 27:32.743
You did three of those?

27:32.845 --> 27:34.111
Did you twist your spine?

27:34.213 --> 27:36.113
She was coding again. I had to.

27:36.215 --> 27:38.749
Defib won't help. She's asystolic now.

27:38.851 --> 27:40.317
Has your numbness crept any higher?

27:40.420 --> 27:41.552
Push more sodium bicarbonate.

27:41.654 --> 27:42.853
You shouldn't have unstrapped yourself.

27:42.955 --> 27:45.356
Has your numbness crept any higher?!

27:45.458 --> 27:46.690
Yes.

27:56.866 --> 27:58.265
Pulse is thready.

27:58.351 --> 28:00.218
No, you don't give up yet, Shannon.

28:00.289 --> 28:02.756
Stay with me
until we get to the hospital.

28:02.825 --> 28:05.292
One IV drip, and you'll feel
so much better.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.060
That road flare
is gonna bring the cavalry.

28:07.162 --> 28:08.829
If you could just...

28:08.931 --> 28:10.230
not die.

28:12.098 --> 28:14.234
Just... hang on.

28:16.523 --> 28:18.786
No.

28:18.869 --> 28:21.503
No, this is not the end
of the road for you, Shannon.

28:21.575 --> 28:22.807
Just...

28:26.013 --> 28:27.946
Come back.

28:29.116 --> 28:31.650
Is it possible that
we've already driven past them?

28:31.718 --> 28:33.084
- Why would you say that?
- I'm just...

28:33.120 --> 28:34.786
- How does that help?!
- He's just trying to explain why...

28:34.855 --> 28:36.388
And I'm just trying to concentrate!

28:36.456 --> 28:39.224
Okay, stop it! Bickering
doesn't find anyone any faster!

28:39.292 --> 28:42.093
Unless anyone sees
something relevant, shut up!

28:53.040 --> 28:54.172
- Herrera.
- No.

28:54.241 --> 28:56.141
You should save your energy.
You might need it...

28:56.243 --> 28:57.108
Shut up!

28:58.512 --> 28:59.811
Andy!

29:03.450 --> 29:04.916
She's gone.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.382
How did this happen?

29:37.451 --> 29:39.551
Her leg was a ticking time bomb.

29:39.586 --> 29:44.723
After her cardiac arrest,
without a hospital...

29:44.825 --> 29:46.858
it was a matter of time.

29:48.628 --> 29:52.130
It's been at least 30 minutes
since I set the flare.

29:52.199 --> 29:53.965
It's probably out.

29:54.034 --> 29:55.700
And it was our only one.

29:58.238 --> 29:59.704
No one's gonna come for us.

31:21.054 --> 31:23.443
<i>Aid Car 19, hold your position.</i>

31:23.506 --> 31:24.982
<i>We're on our way to you.</i>

31:25.061 --> 31:26.694
You did it.

31:27.961 --> 31:30.495
You got help to us.

31:30.564 --> 31:32.964
Not in time.

31:36.336 --> 31:38.770
We talk a lot about bravery on this job.

31:38.869 --> 31:39.915
But on some occasions,

31:39.940 --> 31:43.141
a firefighter goes
beyond the call of duty.

31:43.243 --> 31:45.643
Now, that kind of bravery...

31:45.745 --> 31:47.846
we call that valor.

31:47.914 --> 31:51.516
And I could not be more proud
to award this Medal of Valor

31:51.618 --> 31:53.318
to Lieutenant Herrera

31:53.386 --> 31:57.755
for her bravery, her strength,
and her exceptional service

31:57.824 --> 32:00.134
the night of the windstorm...
a night we will all remember.

32:48.508 --> 32:52.911
Sadly, Captain Sullivan was
unable to be with us here today.

32:52.979 --> 32:54.846
But he wouldn't be with us at all

32:54.915 --> 32:59.918
if it wasn't for the heroics
of one woman on this stage.

32:59.986 --> 33:03.521
My daughter, Andrea Herrera.

33:25.612 --> 33:26.544
Um...

33:28.148 --> 33:29.847
I, um...

33:36.222 --> 33:37.655
Uh...

33:41.428 --> 33:43.227
Herrera.

33:48.835 --> 33:49.934
Thank you.

33:57.132 --> 33:58.585
Look, I know the windstorm was tough.

33:58.617 --> 34:00.944
You don't feel like you deserve
a medal or praise or...

34:01.015 --> 34:02.911
Can you please slow down?
Just stop a second.

34:02.981 --> 34:05.106
Nope. Got to get home.
I have some drinking to do.

34:05.161 --> 34:08.078
You wanna keep talking at me?
You can do it there.

34:08.164 --> 34:11.031
That's four months of therapy
together, three times a week.

34:11.109 --> 34:14.444
And now, maybe, if you could just...

34:14.545 --> 34:16.603
give me your signature?

34:16.674 --> 34:18.239
I can return to active duty.

34:18.315 --> 34:19.641
Jack, you know I can't do that.

34:19.717 --> 34:21.984
Is it because you'll miss me?
'Cause I can still swing by.

34:22.053 --> 34:23.920
You're still not sleeping.

34:23.987 --> 34:25.087
I slept.

34:25.156 --> 34:29.025
Not a full night's sleep...
without a sleep aid.

34:29.127 --> 34:31.460
I like my firefighters well-rested.

34:31.496 --> 34:34.197
Funny thing... so does the department.

34:34.264 --> 34:36.331
And whatever is keeping you up at night

34:36.434 --> 34:39.135
is something you haven't dealt with.

34:39.204 --> 34:40.603
Not fully.

34:40.705 --> 34:42.071
Not here, with me.

34:44.409 --> 34:45.908
You speaking to Dean yet?

34:48.146 --> 34:50.279
He's your best friend.

34:50.348 --> 34:53.449
I know you feel he betrayed your trust.

34:53.518 --> 34:55.217
I can't restore you to active duty

34:55.253 --> 34:56.853
without a support system.

34:58.790 --> 35:01.390
Yeah, what kind
of support system helps you

35:01.459 --> 35:03.759
by turning you over to an institution?

35:03.828 --> 35:04.861
To a complete stranger,

35:04.929 --> 35:07.063
when maybe what I needed
was some damn stability?

35:07.131 --> 35:08.598
Why don't we talk about that?

35:15.440 --> 35:16.706
You know, when I said that meeting me

35:16.808 --> 35:19.375
after every therapy session
was unnecessary, I meant it.

35:19.477 --> 35:21.377
And when I said I didn't mind,
I meant it, too.

35:21.479 --> 35:22.912
Did she clear you for duty?

35:23.014 --> 35:24.013
Negative.

35:24.115 --> 35:25.181
You'll get there.

35:25.283 --> 35:26.782
You coming tonight to the party?

35:26.885 --> 35:27.817
I can give you a ride.

35:27.919 --> 35:28.918
Also negative.

35:29.020 --> 35:31.087
Oh, come on!
Your messy hair can come, too.

35:31.155 --> 35:33.789
It'll be fun. Snacks and drinks on me.

35:33.858 --> 35:35.424
No, I'm not ready to see anyone.

35:35.493 --> 35:36.692
It's been four months.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.060
I said no.

35:40.598 --> 35:43.065
I feel bad you're missing out
on Herrera's celebration.

35:43.134 --> 35:45.768
Don't. I love stale bagels
and lukewarm coffee.

35:45.837 --> 35:47.203
Yeah.

35:47.305 --> 35:48.604
It's nice.

35:48.706 --> 35:50.006
Being out.

35:50.074 --> 35:51.140
In public.

35:51.242 --> 35:52.275
With you.

35:52.343 --> 35:54.143
Not having to worry
about running into anyone.

35:54.245 --> 35:55.778
It's kinda hot, right?

35:55.847 --> 35:57.580
You realize it's our second time here.

35:57.682 --> 35:58.548
Hm.

35:58.650 --> 36:00.616
Is this, uh...

36:00.685 --> 36:02.385
is this our place now?

36:02.487 --> 36:04.387
Our place?

36:04.455 --> 36:06.455
Can we say we have a place?

36:08.326 --> 36:11.561
You know, I thought
my bed was our place,

36:11.629 --> 36:14.497
since that's where we spend
most of our time together.

36:14.566 --> 36:18.601
And I very much enjoy that time.

36:18.703 --> 36:21.037
But I also enjoy this time.

36:21.105 --> 36:22.872
And maybe...

36:22.907 --> 36:25.841
maybe we can have more
of this time in the future.

36:25.910 --> 36:27.143
What do you think?

36:30.481 --> 36:31.781
I think...

36:31.883 --> 36:34.450
we should get the check.

36:47.465 --> 36:48.698
Excuse me.

36:48.733 --> 36:51.467
Uh, whatever it is you're doing
in there, please don't.

36:51.569 --> 36:52.568
- Sorry.
- It was not...

36:52.670 --> 36:55.171
- It...
- It's not what it...

36:59.611 --> 37:01.310
Okay.

37:01.412 --> 37:02.945
I think we ruined our place.

37:03.014 --> 37:05.147
Mm-hmm. Totally.

37:07.352 --> 37:08.351
Thank you.

37:08.453 --> 37:10.286
You have vinyl records now?

37:10.388 --> 37:11.621
Who are you?

37:11.689 --> 37:13.623
Andy Herrera, Medal of Valor winner,

37:13.725 --> 37:14.957
- record collector...
- Oh, okay.

37:15.059 --> 37:16.325
No more medal talk.

37:16.427 --> 37:17.994
And they're Maya's mostly.

37:18.096 --> 37:19.562
This one is all you.

37:19.631 --> 37:20.730
Guilty.

37:21.766 --> 37:23.332
Hey, Dad.

37:23.434 --> 37:25.001
M'ija.

37:25.069 --> 37:27.937
Your apartment is lovely.

37:28.006 --> 37:29.872
- Just the right amount of space.
- Mm.

37:29.941 --> 37:31.374
Maybe I should take a look around, too.

37:31.442 --> 37:33.376
Find a condo, sell the house, you know?

37:33.478 --> 37:36.379
H-Hold on. Sell my childhood home?

37:36.447 --> 37:39.148
With the porch and the yard and...

37:39.250 --> 37:40.616
You know what I think?

37:40.685 --> 37:43.219
They need more ice in the kitchen.

37:45.089 --> 37:46.489
Sorry we're late. No worries.

37:46.557 --> 37:48.491
Uh, it's called making an entrance.

37:48.559 --> 37:49.392
Mm.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.727
O... kay.

37:51.829 --> 37:53.262
Single now, and I can't cozy up

37:53.331 --> 37:55.064
to any hot new strangers at this party,

37:55.166 --> 37:57.466
because there is literally no strangers.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.818
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, Montgomery,

37:58.849 --> 38:00.203
I've never heard of this person.

38:00.275 --> 38:01.284
Who is Cardib?

38:01.339 --> 38:02.471
Cardib?

38:02.515 --> 38:05.049
Come on. I'll explain it all
over pigs in a blanket.

38:05.143 --> 38:07.109
Ooh! "Cardi B."

38:07.178 --> 38:08.511
Oh, thank you.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.746
So, where is your better half?

38:10.815 --> 38:13.049
She's still in surgery,
but I'll see her later.

38:13.151 --> 38:14.250
At home.

38:14.285 --> 38:15.317
My man.

38:15.386 --> 38:17.153
Damn, it still feels good to say that.

38:17.221 --> 38:19.288
You're just bragging
about that happiness.

38:19.357 --> 38:21.223
I might have to make some moves
to keep it that way.

38:21.292 --> 38:22.358
What kind of moves?

38:22.427 --> 38:23.926
Well, you know,
Miranda has her stress issues,

38:23.995 --> 38:25.961
and I don't want to be a stressor, so...

38:26.030 --> 38:27.763
might be time for me
to quit firefighting.

38:32.837 --> 38:34.737
He shouldn't have dropped that
on you like that.

38:34.839 --> 38:35.738
Right?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.573
Like, "Oh, hey, I'm about to liquidate

38:37.675 --> 38:39.341
the place you called home
your entire life.

38:39.410 --> 38:40.309
Pass the cheese?"

38:40.378 --> 38:41.711
Maybe, um...

38:43.247 --> 38:44.747
Yeah, never mind.

38:46.084 --> 38:47.450
What?

38:47.518 --> 38:48.884
- Nothing.
- No, what? What?

38:48.986 --> 38:50.086
Tell me.

38:51.355 --> 38:53.856
Maybe you're taking
your dad's news extra hard

38:53.891 --> 38:55.858
because you're frustrated
about something else?

38:55.927 --> 38:57.059
Something else like what?

38:57.128 --> 38:58.994
Like... the medal
you don't want to talk about?

38:59.063 --> 39:01.564
Or maybe I'm just
a little mad right now.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.399
About both things.

39:03.468 --> 39:04.734
And a little drunk.

39:04.836 --> 39:06.368
I'm not, like, drunk drunk.

39:06.437 --> 39:08.537
Just drunk-y.

39:08.639 --> 39:10.206
- And mad.
- Okay.

39:10.274 --> 39:12.808
So, you're, uh, drunk-y mad.

39:14.746 --> 39:16.345
How do you always do that?

39:17.849 --> 39:19.715
There were a hundred people
at that ceremony

39:19.784 --> 39:22.818
watching me freeze on that stage.

39:22.887 --> 39:25.654
You're the only one who gets why.

39:26.991 --> 39:30.326
It makes me feel...

39:30.428 --> 39:31.594
naked.

39:33.865 --> 39:35.631
Naked, huh?

39:49.914 --> 39:51.247
Naked.

40:06.197 --> 40:09.064
You just had a little
private party for two

40:09.133 --> 40:10.599
with Ryan, didn't you?

40:13.037 --> 40:14.570
What are we high-fiving?

40:16.941 --> 40:18.507
<i>Surviving a crash...</i>

40:21.145 --> 40:23.712
I convinced Nurse Adam at rehab
to give me an hour.

40:23.748 --> 40:25.447
Oof. Nurse Adam is tough.

40:25.516 --> 40:26.749
Yes, she is.

40:26.818 --> 40:28.284
That was no small feat.

40:28.352 --> 40:30.021
<i>...clawing your way
out of the wreckage...</i>

40:30.091 --> 40:32.988
- Oh. Captain, hi.
- Hey.

40:33.090 --> 40:34.190
You're at our place.

40:34.292 --> 40:35.491
I hope you don't mind.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.293
I didn't want to miss
the chance to toast Herrera.

40:37.361 --> 40:38.594
Good to see you again, sir.

40:38.696 --> 40:39.662
Ryan Tanner.

40:39.764 --> 40:41.130
Officer Tanner.

40:43.634 --> 40:44.600
Right.

40:44.669 --> 40:47.136
Uh... I don't have a free hand to shake.

40:47.238 --> 40:48.671
<i>It makes you stronger...</i>

40:48.773 --> 40:50.372
Oh, l... let's come in.

40:50.474 --> 40:53.175
Let's pop that champagne.

40:53.277 --> 40:55.277
<i>It changes your perspective...</i>

41:00.618 --> 41:03.485
To, uh, new beginnings.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.326
To new beginnings.

41:11.596 --> 41:13.796
Whoa!

41:13.898 --> 41:16.498
<i>...and opens you up...</i>

41:17.869 --> 41:19.368
<i>...to brand-new possibilities.</i>

41:19.429 --> 41:20.585
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
