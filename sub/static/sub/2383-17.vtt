<i>Kids, sometimes wonderful things</i>

00:04.384 --> 00:06.552
<i>come out of horrible situations.</i>

00:06.553 --> 00:08.587
<i>Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong</i>

00:08.588 --> 00:09.521
<i>where I got stuck in the airport?</i>

00:09.623 --> 00:11.441
<i>Well, a funny thing happened that day.</i>

00:11.442 --> 00:13.526
Yes, I realize it's raining,

00:13.527 --> 00:15.161
but, come on, it's 2021.

00:15.162 --> 00:17.096
We can make cell phones
that project holograms,

00:17.097 --> 00:19.532
but a light drizzle shuts
down a whole airport?

00:19.533 --> 00:20.333
Hey, Ted.

00:20.334 --> 00:23.336
Hey...

00:23.337 --> 00:24.971
There she is.

00:24.972 --> 00:26.789
Wow.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.158
Wendy the Waitress. Wendy the Waitress!

00:29.159 --> 00:32.177
I was just saying-- what are you doing here?

00:32.179 --> 00:33.946
<i>What was she doing there?</i>

00:33.947 --> 00:36.415
<i>For that, we have to back
up about ten years.</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.800
So, Barney, I hear you and Nora

00:37.801 --> 00:40.085
had a fun time at laser tag.

00:40.086 --> 00:41.820
I don't know where you heard that.

00:41.821 --> 00:43.022
It was a disaster.

00:43.023 --> 00:44.557
Not according to her.

00:44.558 --> 00:46.859
Oh, my God, this was so much fun.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.194
We have to do this again. We do, we have to.

00:48.195 --> 00:50.062
You want to grab a drink right now?

00:50.063 --> 00:51.630
No, I'm kind of tired.

00:51.631 --> 00:52.731
But...

00:52.732 --> 00:53.766
this is my number.

00:53.767 --> 00:54.833
Give me a call.

00:54.834 --> 00:56.268
Absolutely.

00:56.269 --> 00:57.703
How is that a disaster?

00:57.704 --> 00:59.371
She didn't want to get drinks.

00:59.372 --> 01:01.273
And as soon as a girl says

01:01.274 --> 01:03.609
she doesn't want to get drinks, well...

01:03.610 --> 01:06.245
You want to grab a drink right now? No,
I'm kind of tired.

01:10.817 --> 01:13.619
Absolutely.

01:13.620 --> 01:14.853
It's a shame, too.

01:14.854 --> 01:17.289
She was a really great laser tag partner.

01:17.290 --> 01:19.959
She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.

01:20.860 --> 01:23.429
Please, Cheese. You like this girl.

01:23.430 --> 01:24.930
What? Nora?

01:24.931 --> 01:26.165
No, I don't.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.667
Barney, you can't say her
name without smiling.

01:28.668 --> 01:31.070
That's...

01:31.071 --> 01:32.771
Nora.

01:32.772 --> 01:34.306
Sorry, sorry.

01:34.307 --> 01:35.808
I was thinking of a funny thing

01:35.809 --> 01:37.209
that Nora said. Hmm.

01:37.210 --> 01:38.277
Stop it.

01:38.278 --> 01:39.378
No... ra.

01:39.379 --> 01:40.479
Nah...

01:40.480 --> 01:42.248
Damn it, what is the matter with me?

01:42.249 --> 01:44.049
You like her. You should call her.

01:44.050 --> 01:45.150
Call her?

01:45.151 --> 01:47.886
she had a nice face,

01:47.887 --> 01:51.190
her booty was in place,
but Barney don't chase.

01:51.191 --> 01:52.625
That is ridiculous.

01:52.626 --> 01:54.960
Barney, you know what, here's some advice.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.868
Totally.

02:17.612 --> 02:19.897
<i>Kids, I had just started dating Zoey.</i>

02:19.898 --> 02:21.399
<i>And when you first start dating someone,</i>

02:21.400 --> 02:23.734
<i>everyone wants to know the same thing.
How did we meet?</i>

02:23.735 --> 02:26.670
Oh, Ted, she doesn't want... No,
it's a cute story.

02:26.671 --> 02:28.322
Once upon a time...

02:28.323 --> 02:31.208
<i>Zoey was married to this super rich,
super creepy guy</i>

02:31.209 --> 02:33.875
<i>called The Captain.</i>

02:33.910 --> 02:35.612
<i>So when Zoey and I became friends,</i>

02:35.613 --> 02:37.747
<i>I was careful not to cross any lines.</i>

02:37.748 --> 02:40.650
Oh, man, this movie is scary.

02:40.651 --> 02:41.451
I know, right?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.220
<i>But then one day,</i>

02:43.221 --> 02:46.089
<i>Zoey and The Captain had
 a huge fight.</i>

02:46.090 --> 02:49.292
<i>He flipped out and demanded 
a divorce.</i>

02:49.293 --> 02:51.261
<i>And she was heartbroken.</i>

02:51.262 --> 02:52.896
<i>But after a little soul-searching,</i>

02:52.897 --> 02:56.816
<i>she ended up back in my life,
and the rest, as they say,</i>

02:56.817 --> 02:59.102
is history.

02:59.103 --> 03:01.638
Actually, I said, "How's your meat?"

03:01.639 --> 03:03.206
Oh.

03:04.207 --> 03:06.108
A little cold.

03:06.109 --> 03:07.409
Gee, wonder why.

03:09.696 --> 03:12.414
Oh, Ted, did you have a
chance to pick up that box

03:12.449 --> 03:13.416
I left at my old apartment?

03:13.417 --> 03:16.653
Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.055
I mean this in a super manly way.

03:19.056 --> 03:21.090
That guy scares the panties off me.

03:21.091 --> 03:22.325
You don't have to see him.

03:22.326 --> 03:24.561
He left the box with the doorman.

03:24.562 --> 03:27.230
If it's really important to you,
I will pick it up tomorrow.

03:27.231 --> 03:29.632
All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big

03:29.633 --> 03:32.802
meaningless stack of paperwork
that I have to get off my desk

03:32.803 --> 03:35.839
to make room for tomorrow's big
meaningless stack of paperwork.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.441
But it's all worth it,

03:38.442 --> 03:42.078
you know, 'cause at least I know
I'm making the world a... place.

03:42.079 --> 03:44.013
All right, see you guys later.

03:44.949 --> 03:46.549
I'm worried about Marshall.

03:46.550 --> 03:48.518
He doesn't seem like himself lately.

03:48.519 --> 03:50.687
Yeah, he's been really... quiet.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.789
Well, that's just what
Minnesota guys are like--

03:52.790 --> 03:54.958
strong, silent, you know, man's man.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.459
Like Prince.

03:56.460 --> 03:58.261
No, it's more than that.

03:58.262 --> 04:00.563
It's like, all the stuff he used to love,

04:00.564 --> 04:04.100
he suddenly has no interest in anymore.

04:04.101 --> 04:05.802
Oh.

04:05.803 --> 04:07.504
Ha-wink.

04:07.505 --> 04:08.872
Excuse me?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.940
Lily, in my travels,

04:10.941 --> 04:13.343
I've developed a finely calibrated sense

04:13.344 --> 04:15.245
of how long it's been since--

04:15.246 --> 04:17.447
How do I not put this delicately?--

04:17.447 --> 04:18.781
a girl's been porked.

04:18.781 --> 04:19.716
And, boo,

04:19.716 --> 04:21.651
you've been pork-free so long,

04:21.652 --> 04:23.253
you're practically kosher.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.154
It's been a while.

04:25.155 --> 04:27.991
Five weeks, three days by my estimation.

04:27.992 --> 04:30.326
You should work at a carnival.

04:30.327 --> 04:31.461
I tried.

04:31.462 --> 04:33.196
They're pretty strict with backgrounds.

04:33.197 --> 04:34.731
Anyway, we should get going.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.199
Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.735
Good night. Good night, guys.

18 weeks.

04:49.146 --> 04:50.113
Damn it.

04:50.114 --> 04:52.415
Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.416
Hmm.

04:53.417 --> 04:54.884
But I just started a new job,

04:54.885 --> 04:56.553
and dating's been on the back burner, and...

04:56.554 --> 04:57.887
Shh.

04:57.888 --> 05:01.090
Child, listen.

05:01.091 --> 05:02.592
If you're really hurting for it,

05:02.593 --> 05:04.861
I'd be more than happy to throw you one.

05:04.862 --> 05:07.130
Throw me one? Yeah.

05:07.131 --> 05:09.832
We're exes. We're probably
due for a backslide.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.802
Or we could just do it the normal way.

05:12.803 --> 05:14.704
Oh, I see what's going on.

05:14.705 --> 05:15.738
Yeah?

05:15.739 --> 05:17.240
This is about Nora.

05:17.241 --> 05:21.828
You met a girl, you liked her,
but then you missed your shot.

05:21.829 --> 05:24.647
And now you're trying to hook
up with your ex-girlfriend

05:24.648 --> 05:26.816
to prove to yourself that you don't care.

05:26.817 --> 05:29.152
Robin, you could not be more--

05:29.153 --> 05:31.087
What do you mean I missed my shot?

05:31.088 --> 05:32.989
Nora met a guy. What?!

05:34.091 --> 05:35.525
What?

05:35.526 --> 05:36.826
Yep. Off the market.

05:36.827 --> 05:38.845
He's taking her to Cafe
L'Amour this Friday night.

05:38.846 --> 05:40.013
But "L'Amour" means love!

05:40.014 --> 05:41.531
They're going to the cafe of love!

05:41.532 --> 05:42.899
I'm fine. It's fine.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.067
Point is,

05:44.068 --> 05:47.604
Robin, I don't even like Nora.

05:47.605 --> 05:49.005
Damn it!

05:50.808 --> 05:54.444
Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?

05:54.445 --> 05:56.245
I can't sleep.

05:56.246 --> 05:58.147
Mmm.

05:58.148 --> 06:01.551
Anything I can do to help 
you with that?

06:01.552 --> 06:05.288
Maybe after this documentary 
on garbage.

06:05.289 --> 06:08.825
Man, I am losing my touch.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.127
Nearly twice the size of Texas,

06:11.128 --> 06:14.163
the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch,
or "Garbage Island,"

06:14.164 --> 06:16.032
is an enviwonmental disaster.

06:16.033 --> 06:18.468
Sepawated from its pawents,

06:18.469 --> 06:20.937
this young bird stwuggles to survive,

06:20.938 --> 06:23.840
stwangling itself in the
plastic wings of a six-pack.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.560
Marshall Eriksen, I think you
know what you have to do.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.062
I have to save the planet!

06:29.063 --> 06:30.780
Is it over? I call on top.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.515
Ow!

06:32.516 --> 06:34.651
<i>A few days later, I headed over
to The Captain's building</i>

06:34.652 --> 06:36.152
<i>to get Zoey's box.</i>

06:36.153 --> 06:37.720
I'm here to... Ted.

06:37.721 --> 06:39.889
What a surprise.

06:46.901 --> 06:48.068
Ted.

06:48.069 --> 06:49.570
Captain. I...

06:49.571 --> 06:50.871
You've come to rescue me

06:50.872 --> 06:53.807
from the capsized wreckage of my marriage.

06:53.808 --> 06:55.008
Mm...

06:55.009 --> 06:56.143
I hesitated calling you

06:56.144 --> 06:58.145
because I know you and 
Zoey were friendly.

06:58.146 --> 07:00.147
Pssh, nah... But my wife has left me.

07:00.148 --> 07:02.483
All my friends have abandoned me.

07:02.484 --> 07:03.550
Please,

07:03.551 --> 07:05.786
tell me you're on my side.

07:10.125 --> 07:13.060
Let's adjourn to the study.

07:16.164 --> 07:17.264
Garbage Island.

07:17.265 --> 07:18.565
You haven't heard

07:18.566 --> 07:20.734
of Garbage Island?

07:21.302 --> 07:22.802
It's an island...

07:22.803 --> 07:24.605
made of garbage!

07:24.606 --> 07:26.340
It's in the Pacific Ocean.

07:26.341 --> 07:28.442
It's twice the size of Texas!

07:28.443 --> 07:31.311
In other words,
one-eighth the size of Canada.

07:31.312 --> 07:33.380
So...

07:33.381 --> 07:36.216
Guys, I'm going environmental, okay?

07:36.217 --> 07:37.985
Phase one: the bar.

07:37.986 --> 07:39.786
I've already convinced
MacLaren's to implement

07:39.787 --> 07:40.888
a new green initiative.

07:40.889 --> 07:42.055
That's 'cause of you?

07:42.056 --> 07:44.625
I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles

07:44.626 --> 07:46.827
to the recycling center every night.

07:47.495 --> 07:48.795
I threw my back out.

07:48.796 --> 07:51.865
You're welcome... Earth.

07:53.334 --> 07:54.902
GNB.

07:54.903 --> 07:56.520
Tomorrow I'm going to make 
a presentation

07:56.521 --> 07:58.672
in front of the board about 
how we can cut

07:58.673 --> 08:02.242
our carbon footprint by
half for only $12 million.

08:02.243 --> 08:04.178
Dude, don't do that.
All they're going to hear

08:04.179 --> 08:06.580
is "$12 million,
" and all you're going to hear

08:06.581 --> 08:08.782
is the sound of the door
smacking your fired ass.

08:08.783 --> 08:10.851
And some muffled laughter.

08:10.852 --> 08:12.619
Which I apologize for in advance.

08:12.620 --> 08:13.921
Guys,

08:13.922 --> 08:15.088
I got a problem.

08:15.089 --> 08:17.457
I ran into The Captain.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.627
Ted, beneath this

08:20.628 --> 08:25.132
lustrous mane,
I wear the horns of a cuckold.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.435
Zoey left me for another man.

08:29.404 --> 08:30.804
Wow.

08:30.805 --> 08:33.173
Do you have any idea who it could be?

08:33.174 --> 08:35.475
<i>The Captain then told a story much different</i>

08:35.476 --> 08:36.809
than the one I'd been telling.

08:36.811 --> 08:39.078
<i>But one maybe just as true.</i>

08:39.080 --> 08:42.182
Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy.

08:42.183 --> 08:44.384
Blissful as Arcadian shepherds.

08:44.385 --> 08:45.552
<i>I was Poseidon,</i>

08:45.553 --> 08:47.854
<i>she my Amphitrite.</i>

08:47.855 --> 08:49.656
<i>I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis</i>

08:49.657 --> 08:51.758
could not have torn us asunder.

08:51.759 --> 08:55.162
We had great big boners for each other.

08:55.163 --> 08:56.897
But then...

08:56.898 --> 08:59.132
enter the scoundrel.

08:59.133 --> 09:02.469
Oh, man, this movie's scary.

09:02.470 --> 09:05.439
I know, eh?

09:05.440 --> 09:06.623
<i>I don't know what he looks like,</i>

09:06.624 --> 09:07.841
<i>but I picture him with a mustache.</i>

09:07.842 --> 09:09.076
<i> Yes!</i>

09:09.077 --> 09:11.845
Limit the search to guys
with mustaches. Smart.

09:11.846 --> 09:15.415
Anyway, soon the inevitable 
happened.

09:15.416 --> 09:18.218
<i>She told me she was in love
with someone else.</i>

09:18.219 --> 09:20.287
<i>Obviously, it made me angry.</i>

09:20.288 --> 09:22.689
And that's the last time you saw her.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.658
But I gathered my composure,

09:24.659 --> 09:26.727
<i>and told her I'd do anything 
to keep her.</i>

09:26.728 --> 09:28.428
<i>I begged her not to leave.</i>

09:28.429 --> 09:30.397
<i>We made love that night.</i>

09:31.866 --> 09:34.301
That's damn good brandy.

09:34.302 --> 09:36.270
But morning came,

09:36.271 --> 09:38.238
and she was gone.

09:38.239 --> 09:40.991
Oh, Captain...

09:40.992 --> 09:42.476
don't blame yourself.

09:42.477 --> 09:45.212
I don't blame myself. Hmm?

09:45.213 --> 09:49.116
There's only one man I blame for this.

09:49.117 --> 09:50.083
Me.

09:51.019 --> 09:52.352
I'm the bad guy.

09:52.353 --> 09:55.622
Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story

09:55.623 --> 09:57.624
of picking up the box for Zoey,

09:57.625 --> 09:59.159
you're the hero.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.994
Damn it! The box!

10:07.068 --> 10:10.804
Baby, baby, I really got to
work on this presentation.

10:10.805 --> 10:12.406
Oh, that's too bad,

10:12.407 --> 10:15.859
'cause I was going to make a
little presentation of my own.

10:18.246 --> 10:21.915
from now until tomorrow afternoon,

10:21.916 --> 10:26.553
I do this, and then
tomorrow night, I do that.

10:26.554 --> 10:27.754
Deal.

10:31.292 --> 10:32.959
Come on, come on.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.328
Lily!

10:36.831 --> 10:40.300
You lying little minx.

10:40.301 --> 10:42.936
I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight

10:42.937 --> 10:45.439
from 5:00 p.m. until closing,

10:45.440 --> 10:47.607
reading a newspaper with
two holes cut out of it,

10:47.608 --> 10:49.142
and I never saw Nora

10:49.143 --> 10:50.944
or this Italian race car
driver she's dating.

10:50.945 --> 10:52.779
Sorry. Who said anything about an...?

10:52.780 --> 10:55.015
Come on, you just know he's
an Italian race car driver.

10:55.016 --> 10:56.216
No, he's not. He doesn't exist.

10:56.217 --> 10:58.685
I made the whole thing up
to see if you like her.

10:58.686 --> 10:59.953
And you do.

11:00.922 --> 11:02.255
So you should just call her.

11:03.057 --> 11:05.025
Here is her number.

11:08.579 --> 11:10.030
And I also programmed it

11:10.031 --> 11:12.666
into your phone while you
were in the bathroom.

11:16.604 --> 11:19.840
Wow. That was a joke.
You just got here, remember?

11:20.942 --> 11:23.176
You really are smitten.

11:23.177 --> 11:24.444
No, I'm not.

11:24.445 --> 11:25.545
I'm Barney Stinson.

11:25.546 --> 11:28.382
I don't get smitten, I smite!

11:28.383 --> 11:29.983
You are totally smitten,

11:29.984 --> 11:31.952
but you're scared of
being in a relationship.

11:31.953 --> 11:33.053
No, I'm not.

11:33.054 --> 11:35.922
I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin.

11:35.923 --> 11:38.191
If I got serious with Nora, it would be like

11:38.192 --> 11:40.093
if Mother Teresa focused
all her attention on

11:40.094 --> 11:42.195
one really hot orphan.

11:42.196 --> 11:45.732
With great penis comes
 great responsibility.

11:45.733 --> 11:49.236
Okay, Mother Teresa,

11:49.237 --> 11:50.604
throw me one.

11:50.605 --> 11:52.005
Sorry?

11:52.006 --> 11:54.207
I would like it if you threw me one.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.842
Fastball, right down the middle.

11:55.843 --> 11:59.112
Actually, if I recall correctly,
a slight curve.

11:59.113 --> 12:01.448
Careful, Robin, I'll do it.

12:01.449 --> 12:03.250
Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm.

12:03.251 --> 12:05.719
Because you don't want to
screw things up with Nora.

12:05.720 --> 12:06.887
Hey, prove me wrong.

12:06.888 --> 12:08.555
Tomorrow night, my place.

12:08.556 --> 12:10.123
Don't poke the dragon, Robin,

12:10.124 --> 12:13.260
'cause the dragon will poke you back.

12:17.949 --> 12:19.866
Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.268
Oh, no, baby, come on.

12:21.269 --> 12:23.637
Today didn't go so well.

12:23.638 --> 12:25.839
The green initiative,

12:25.840 --> 12:27.741
for only $12 million, will change the way...

12:27.742 --> 12:28.875
Okay, I've heard enough.

12:28.876 --> 12:31.344
Don't we already have a green initiative?

12:31.345 --> 12:33.613
I mean, didn't we do a whole thing?

12:33.614 --> 12:35.982
Hang a banner, make a video,
Sting was there.

12:35.983 --> 12:37.384
I thought I met Sting.

12:37.385 --> 12:38.418
You did meet Sting.

12:38.419 --> 12:39.669
Yeah, I met Sting.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.305
So why on Earth would we
spend another $12 million?

12:42.306 --> 12:44.090
Well, because we can always do more.

12:44.091 --> 12:46.059
Yeah, but I met Sting.

12:46.060 --> 12:48.895
Well, meeting Sting isn't
gonna fix anything, Arthur!

12:48.896 --> 12:52.599
Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?

12:53.534 --> 12:56.670
Well, he has some good points.

12:56.671 --> 12:57.871
Meeker, you're fired!

12:57.872 --> 13:01.074
And as for you, Eriksen...
His father just died.

13:01.075 --> 13:02.909
...nice presentation.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.778
We'll keep it under advisement.

13:05.913 --> 13:07.781
Meeker got fired because of me.

13:07.782 --> 13:09.616
I'm the bad guy.

13:09.617 --> 13:11.785
No, sweetie, just-just put all that

13:11.786 --> 13:14.120
out of your mind and relax.

13:14.121 --> 13:18.825
Look, I got you a six-pack
of tall boys from the deli.

13:26.734 --> 13:28.034
Hey, baby. Yeah?

13:28.035 --> 13:30.003
What happened to the plastic rings

13:30.004 --> 13:32.005
that held the six-pack together?

13:32.006 --> 13:33.807
Oh, I-I don't know.

13:33.808 --> 13:35.508
I threw them down the garbage chute.

13:35.509 --> 13:36.693
Let's just use the handcuffs instead.

13:36.694 --> 13:39.179
Baby, birds can get caught in those

13:39.180 --> 13:41.414
and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish!

13:41.415 --> 13:42.582
Weren't you listening?

13:42.583 --> 13:44.417
Don't you care about Garbage Island?

13:44.418 --> 13:46.253
Marshall, right now,
I don't give a wat's ass

13:46.254 --> 13:47.220
about Garbage Island.

13:47.221 --> 13:48.822
Well, I do.

13:48.823 --> 13:50.624
I got to find those rings!

13:53.160 --> 13:55.529
Cwap.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.998
Hi, I'm here to pick up...

13:57.999 --> 13:59.332
Hello, Ted.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.500
To the study?

14:00.501 --> 14:02.736
To the study! Mmm.

14:04.055 --> 14:05.722
Ted...

14:07.875 --> 14:09.743
I know.

14:09.744 --> 14:11.411
Know what?

14:11.412 --> 14:13.246
I know who stole my Zoey.

14:13.247 --> 14:15.882
No man likes to be betrayed,

14:15.883 --> 14:17.551
especially by a friend.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.486
You can imagine then

14:19.487 --> 14:22.255
how painful it was when
I learned that the name

14:22.256 --> 14:23.490
of my betrayer is...

14:23.491 --> 14:26.660
Ted...

14:26.661 --> 14:28.945
when I tell you who it is, you're gonna...

14:32.266 --> 14:33.800
It's my doorman!

14:35.503 --> 14:37.537
That son of a bitch!

14:41.991 --> 14:43.792
You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?

14:43.793 --> 14:47.429
He always winks and tips
his hat when he sees her.

14:47.430 --> 14:49.247
I know how these things work.

14:49.248 --> 14:50.365
He holds her package,

14:50.366 --> 14:52.033
and pretty soon, she's holding his.

14:52.034 --> 14:53.001
And then there's

14:53.002 --> 14:54.769
his glorious mustache.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.371
I will have him fired for this!

14:56.372 --> 14:58.573
No, no, no, you can't fire him.

14:58.574 --> 15:00.041
You're right.

15:02.011 --> 15:05.380
Maritime protocol demands
physical retribution!

15:05.381 --> 15:06.515
Oh, my God! No, no!

15:06.516 --> 15:08.266
No physical retribution! Stop!

15:08.267 --> 15:10.652
Who is this flower child,
and what has he done

15:10.653 --> 15:12.521
with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!

15:12.522 --> 15:14.356
Look, look, yes, yes,

15:14.357 --> 15:16.124
the doorman is a scoundrel.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.776
The mustache alone gives that away.

15:17.777 --> 15:20.779
He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!

15:20.780 --> 15:23.431
Whoa, "rapscallion"
may be going a bit far, Ted.

15:23.432 --> 15:25.367
But it's not his fault, okay?

15:25.368 --> 15:26.902
It's nobody's fault.

15:26.903 --> 15:28.236
You and Zoey

15:28.237 --> 15:29.638
have nothing in common.

15:29.639 --> 15:31.640
For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats!

15:31.641 --> 15:32.841
You're just

15:32.842 --> 15:34.075
not right for each other.

15:34.076 --> 15:36.711
Look, I know it's tough to face,
but I'm sure

15:36.712 --> 15:39.381
a small part of you has always known that.

15:44.153 --> 15:46.388
Why couldn't she just like boats?

15:47.290 --> 15:49.758
Just to have one thing in common?

15:49.759 --> 15:51.560
Other girls like boats, don't they?

15:51.561 --> 15:53.428
Of course they do.

15:53.429 --> 15:56.064
And you'll find one.

15:56.065 --> 15:57.832
And you'll be much happier with her

15:57.833 --> 15:59.734
than you ever were with Zoey.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.371
When you put it that way,

16:03.372 --> 16:05.774
I should almost thank the doorman.

16:05.775 --> 16:08.610
Yeah, yeah!

16:08.611 --> 16:12.814
And, you know, since,
since it doesn't really matter

16:12.815 --> 16:14.516
who Zoey's dating now...

16:14.517 --> 16:15.950
It doesn't, it really doesn't.

16:15.951 --> 16:17.185
It doesn't.

16:18.054 --> 16:20.322
It's me. You're welcome.

16:29.198 --> 16:31.066
Okay, baby, what gives?

16:31.067 --> 16:33.768
I'm sorry, but neither of
us are getting any action

16:33.769 --> 16:35.737
until I find those rings.

16:37.073 --> 16:39.641
I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.

16:43.362 --> 16:44.496
All right, Robin,

16:44.497 --> 16:45.780
give it to me.

16:45.781 --> 16:48.650
Damn it, Barney, you failed my test!

16:48.651 --> 16:50.719
You know, I- I try to root for you.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.953
Even as your ex-girlfriend,

16:51.954 --> 16:53.622
when you meet someone, I'm like,

16:53.623 --> 16:55.257
"Yeah, Barney, go get her!"

16:55.258 --> 16:57.092
But you know what? Just forget it.

16:57.093 --> 16:59.994
You're never gonna change.
I'm done trying to help you.

17:01.213 --> 17:03.265
The number.

17:03.266 --> 17:07.102
Give me the number,
'cause I really can't tell...

17:08.604 --> 17:10.872
Is that a seven or a nine?

17:10.873 --> 17:12.140
It's a five, idiot.

17:12.141 --> 17:15.377
A fi...? In what moon man
language is that a five?

17:15.377 --> 17:17.444
"Moon man language"?
What does that even mean?

17:17.445 --> 17:19.446
How am I supposed to see that's a five?

17:19.448 --> 17:21.516
Look how you taped this up...
Fine, fine, fine.

17:21.517 --> 17:23.851
I have a phone call to make.

17:25.554 --> 17:26.721
Barney.

17:27.890 --> 17:29.190
Go get her.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.762
Listen, Zoey,

17:33.763 --> 17:36.231
I need to ask you something.

17:36.232 --> 17:37.932
Did I steal you?

17:37.933 --> 17:40.502
Well... yeah.

17:40.503 --> 17:42.103
You did.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.505
By being the kind of

17:43.506 --> 17:46.474
sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think

17:46.475 --> 17:49.544
of stealing someone, you stole me.

17:49.545 --> 17:51.780
So I'm the bad guy.

17:51.781 --> 17:53.748
Great.

17:53.749 --> 17:55.684
Well, the story isn't over, Ted.

17:55.685 --> 17:58.019
It'll be years before we
know who's the good guy

17:58.020 --> 17:59.487
and who's the bad guy.

17:59.488 --> 18:01.256
I mean, yes,

18:01.257 --> 18:02.907
divorce sucks,

18:02.908 --> 18:07.062
but sometimes things need to fall apart

18:07.063 --> 18:09.230
to make way for better things.

18:09.231 --> 18:12.233
If you say so.

18:12.234 --> 18:15.203
I'm just saying,
the eggs are already broken.

18:15.204 --> 18:18.006
Let's make sure we get a
pretty good omelet out of it.

18:18.841 --> 18:21.075
Okay, Marshall,

18:21.076 --> 18:23.945
seriously, what's going on?

18:25.881 --> 18:28.917
He'll never get to see how I turn out.

18:28.918 --> 18:30.585
What do you mean?

18:30.586 --> 18:32.387
My dad. You know,

18:32.388 --> 18:34.756
I used to, um, I used to always tell him

18:34.757 --> 18:36.458
that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer.

18:36.459 --> 18:38.693
And he was always so proud of me for that.

18:38.694 --> 18:39.961
But he never

18:39.962 --> 18:42.864
got to see the version of
me that was anything but

18:42.865 --> 18:44.799
a corporate stooge.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.468
And now it's too late.

18:46.469 --> 18:49.938
And we're starting a family, you know.

18:49.939 --> 18:52.240
Are you avoiding sleeping with me

18:52.241 --> 18:54.442
'cause you don't want to start a family?

18:54.443 --> 18:58.146
Lily, if we have a baby right now,

18:58.147 --> 19:01.850
that is just it for me.

19:02.651 --> 19:04.185
The cement will dry,

19:04.186 --> 19:07.756
and I will be stuck at GNB forever.

19:07.757 --> 19:09.791
Marshall,

19:09.792 --> 19:13.194
if you want to quit your job and
go work for the NRDC right now,

19:13.195 --> 19:15.797
then you need to do that right now.

19:15.798 --> 19:17.065
And then,

19:17.066 --> 19:19.401
once you've cleaned up all the oceans

19:19.402 --> 19:21.603
and saved the planet--

19:21.604 --> 19:25.640
you know, like, a year from now--
then we'll start a family.

19:25.641 --> 19:27.642
I don't know.

19:27.643 --> 19:30.645
So far, in the name of saving the planet,

19:30.646 --> 19:34.082
I've ruined your night,
I practically broke Wendy's back

19:34.083 --> 19:35.884
and I got Meeker fired.

19:35.885 --> 19:37.352
The guy must hate me.

19:37.353 --> 19:38.887
Meeker doesn't hate you.

19:38.888 --> 19:41.089
<i>Oh, Meeker hated him, all right.</i>

19:41.090 --> 19:44.209
<i>After all, Marshall was the
one who got him fired.</i>

19:44.210 --> 19:46.094
<i>Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's.</i>

19:46.095 --> 19:48.463
<i>So that night, he went there
to confront Marshall.</i>

19:48.464 --> 19:50.298
<i>But as luck would have it...</i>

19:50.299 --> 19:52.934
Are you guys...? Closed. Sorry.

19:56.722 --> 19:58.106
Thanks.

19:58.107 --> 19:59.774
Rough night?

19:59.775 --> 20:01.876
Yeah. I'm sorry.

20:01.877 --> 20:05.113
It's not your fault. It's no one's fault.

20:05.114 --> 20:06.781
Except for Marshall Eriksen.

20:06.782 --> 20:08.450
What did you just say?

20:08.451 --> 20:12.153
Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault.

20:12.154 --> 20:13.455
Why, do you know him?

20:13.456 --> 20:16.224
Know him? I hate that guy.

20:16.225 --> 20:17.859
Me, too.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.661
Well, hey.

20:19.662 --> 20:23.198
<i>And the rest, as they say...</i>

20:23.199 --> 20:24.566
...is history.

20:24.567 --> 20:26.134
And three kids later,

20:26.135 --> 20:28.870
we decided to come here
on our second honeymoon.

20:28.871 --> 20:30.722
Wow.

20:30.723 --> 20:32.607
That's a pretty good omelet.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.442
Oh, and hey, what about you?

20:34.443 --> 20:35.477
You still with Zoey?

20:35.478 --> 20:39.180
No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well.

20:39.181 --> 20:40.265
But it's all for the best,

20:40.266 --> 20:41.516
'cause now I'm married to

20:41.517 --> 20:43.268
an amazing girl, we have two kids.

20:43.269 --> 20:45.753
It's actually a funny story of how we met.

20:45.754 --> 20:48.490
<i>I was a best man at this wedding...</i>

20:48.491 --> 20:51.459
Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you,
but we got to run.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.696
Okay, well, have a safe trip.
It was great seeing you.

21:00.603 --> 21:02.303
Hello. Marshall.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.404
Hey, Ted.

21:03.405 --> 21:07.008
Hey. You will not believe
who I just ran into.
