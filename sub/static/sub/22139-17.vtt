Ladies and gentlemen,

00:17.751 --> 00:20.654
guess whose insane brain
is East Orlando High's

00:20.688 --> 00:23.991
newest inductee
to the National Honor Society.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.393
Your ex-girlfriend,
Alison.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.396
It's me.
I made Honor Roll.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.200
I'm sorry.
Am I sleeping?

00:32.233 --> 00:34.001
Did the beef stew
put me to sleep?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.403
Am I at risk
of drowning

00:35.436 --> 00:38.539
because I'm sleeping facedown
in a bowl of beef stew?

00:38.572 --> 00:39.707
Not a dream, Ma.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.242
Y'all have been on me
to get it together.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.411
Well, I've been here,
waking up two minutes

00:43.444 --> 00:44.778
before I have to leave
for school,

00:44.812 --> 00:47.548
crushing
that A-minus/B-plus lifestyle.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.351
That's great, Eddie.
I am so proud of you.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.885
Well done, Eddie.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.957
Whoa.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.593
It just goes to show how
if you somewhat apply yourself

00:59.627 --> 01:01.562
at the last minute,
anything is --

01:01.595 --> 01:02.330
Raaaaugh!

01:04.232 --> 01:05.966
Excuse me.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.938
It's okay.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.107
Luckily, I have the number
to Pizza Town memorized.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.109
Wait. No, I don't.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.644

Oh, God.
Now you speak French?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.138
Listen, I know
it must be hard for you.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.307
You're used to being the
biggest brains in the family.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.441
You've got it all wrong.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.076
I'm happy for you.

Buddy, I know anger-folding

01:52.646 --> 01:54.948
Eddie,
I am proud of you.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.017
But a thank-you
would've been nice.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.319
For what?

01:58.352 --> 02:00.288
I'm the reason you're getting
into Honor Society.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.689
I'm the reason
you've been able

02:01.722 --> 02:04.458
to wake up two minutes
before school every day!

02:04.492 --> 02:06.960
Every morning,
I get up early

02:06.994 --> 02:10.631
to set your toothbrush
and toilet seat.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.367
Then I sneak greens
into your lunch

02:13.401 --> 02:14.635
for brain development.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.838
And I get your homework,
the bus schedule,

02:17.871 --> 02:21.008
and exact change in quarters --
in case of emergency --

02:21.041 --> 02:22.843
into your backpack.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.545
I dreamt I was a mer-man.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.214
* Yeah

02:26.247 --> 02:28.148
Huh. I've been using
that change

02:28.182 --> 02:29.650
to buy sausage
at 7-Eleven.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.785
And you never wondered
how it got there?

02:31.819 --> 02:32.820
I thought Mom did it.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.121
Please.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.290
Mom's just trying to keep
your head above water.

02:36.324 --> 02:38.859
I'm trying to get you
to the other side of the pool.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.794
Since when do you care
whether or not I do well?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.330
Since you started
high school,

02:42.363 --> 02:44.298
which is the first year
of precollege.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.800
I want to visit you
at Stanford, not jail.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.036
Well, I didn't ask you
to do any of this.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.238
I'm a grown human,

02:50.271 --> 02:52.640
taller than Mom and Dad.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.041
I can take care of myself.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.810
I would love to see you get by
without all my help.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.579
Good,
'cause that's what I'll do.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.013
G'luck!

03:00.047 --> 03:01.382
Don't you mean
bonne chance?

03:05.085 --> 03:06.520

Ooh, are we doing this?

03:11.191 --> 03:14.194
Officer, I've been baaaaad.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.929
No. It's from my book.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.898
I just got another round
of publisher notes,

03:17.931 --> 03:19.233
this time from Vera.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.169
She says my police sections
lack authenticity.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.105
"Officer Moretti
turns to Jennifer Hong.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.240
'Take a look, Hong.

Those three gunshot holes

03:27.775 --> 03:30.077
make the head look like
a bowling ball.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.681
But this poor son of a bitch
wasn't spared.'"

03:33.714 --> 03:35.048
That's perfect, right?

03:35.082 --> 03:36.517
It's not great.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.085
I know.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.020
That Vera has a good eye.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.955
Luckily, Corporal Bryson
has agreed

03:41.989 --> 03:43.791
to let me do a ride-along
with him tomorrow

03:43.824 --> 03:47.060
so I can see what a real
police officer does all day.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.462
Tomorrow
is St. Patrick's Day.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.463
Perfect.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.132
to break the rules.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.701
Look at the band U2.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.135
Not even spelling
is safe.

it's a huge moneymaker.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.543
I love that guy.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.645
He's like whiskey --
burns your throat going down,

04:04.678 --> 04:05.946
but then it gives you
some good ideas,

04:05.979 --> 04:07.581
and eventually you come
to depend on it.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.116
Okay,
tell me what you think.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.183
Okay.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.086
Too much?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.488
If I were a cop,

04:14.522 --> 04:17.591
I'd arrest you for aggravated
assault of the eyes.

I have some sad news.

What happened?
Is it Dolly?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.878
It's Roasters.
We're filing for bankruptcy.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.213
You'll get a chance
to buy back my half

05:13.246 --> 05:15.349
of your restaurant
for pennies on the dollar.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.885
Yes!

05:17.918 --> 05:19.286
Oh, no.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.621
Koo Koo Roo got ya,
huh?

05:20.654 --> 05:21.855
Afraid so.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.291
Tell Matthew Chestnut
he's fired for me.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.460
Wait. Me?
Why do I have to do it?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.496
Because I don't want to.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.063
Call me when it's done.

05:34.368 --> 05:39.373

05:39.407 --> 05:41.308
Most cops wear
standard-issue slacks,

05:41.341 --> 05:43.243
but I go with
the tighter motorcycle pants

05:43.276 --> 05:44.745
'cause I like
the range of motion.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.980
But in the summertime,
I switch to shorts --

05:47.014 --> 05:49.082
horse-cop shorts,
not bike-cop shorts.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.151
Shouldn't you be
writing this down?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.086
No.
This is all unusable.

something exciting to happen.

Emery, you look bored.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.740
I'm not bored.
Yeah, you seem bored.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.041
Come have a seat.

Eddie's gonna try and get
himself out the door for school

06:16.644 --> 06:17.845

Look. His homework --

nowhere near his backpack.
Hmm.

to be quite the poop show.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.060
Is he gonna spit it
in the --

06:34.261 --> 06:36.697
Oh, my God.
He swallowed it!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.231
Guess that counts
as breakfast.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.400
Look!
Unmatched shoes!

06:40.434 --> 06:42.202
He's doing
everything wrong.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.571
But he's getting it done.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.772
Surprised?

06:44.805 --> 06:47.107
I got up a whole five minutes
earlier today.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.442
The sun looked different.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.077
There's my ride.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.745
What about your lunch?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.313
We're swinging by
Jack in the Box.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.915
I'm treating Nicole
to a Breakfast Jack

06:54.948 --> 06:57.150
for giving me a ride to the
Honor Society pinning tonight.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.285
Later, nerds.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.823
Aha! I knew it.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.291
He left his homework.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.093
Later,
10-second-older nerds.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.464
He really doesn't need me.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.933
Hey, I still need you.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.768
Do you want to make me
some pancakes or something?

07:14.802 --> 07:17.805
I've hit my limit with you
early today.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.011
Okay, yeah, got it, Nicole.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.847
Y'know, I thought of you
the other day --

07:26.880 --> 07:28.516
Oh, no, no, no.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.783
It's okay.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.018
Next time, next time.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.720
We're all busy.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.107
Hi, Evan.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.476
Are you puttering
around your yard?

07:56.510 --> 07:59.513
I'm just giving things
a once-over, like you do.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.483
Sometimes
she gets sticky.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.218
What's going on?

08:05.252 --> 08:07.120
I used to spend a lot of time
helping Eddie,

08:07.154 --> 08:08.421
and now I'm not.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.060
Do you think our curb numbers
need re

08:13.093 --> 08:15.395
Can you read those?

08:15.428 --> 08:17.330
I know how you feel.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.999
I used to do
a lot for Marvin,

08:19.032 --> 08:21.969
and then I stopped so I could
focus on my pregnancy.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.537
It was tough at first.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.806
Marvin rips open cereal bags
like an animal.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.341
I mean literally from the side,
with his teeth.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.711
Eddie does everything
the wrong way, too.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.180
This morning, he left the house
in unmatched shoes.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.249
Marvin drives 12 miles out of
his way to go to a dry-cleaner

08:36.283 --> 08:39.386
because he likes to read the
phrase of the day on their sign.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.754
Oh, I know that place.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.389
When the Monica Lewinsky news
broke,

08:42.422 --> 08:43.456
they put up the word...

08:46.694 --> 08:48.028
Do you know
what might help you?

08:48.061 --> 08:49.262
A hobby.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.865
It's a great distraction.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.433
It's calming to have
something mindless

08:53.466 --> 08:54.868
to focus your energy on.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.069
That's what Eddie was.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.571
Hohh, up top!

09:01.441 --> 09:03.443
I have always liked
yarn work.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.946
Oh, I got that on my trip
to Chichen Itza.

Then, in chapter eight,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.857
Sergeant Moretti says
to Corporal Turetti --

09:16.890 --> 09:18.759
Why are all the cops
Italian?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.227
Because they're cops.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.363
Cops have all different
kinds of names and ethnicities.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.199
In my unit, we have
an Officer Pemberton-Giles.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.068
That name is so long.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.070
It would add like nine pages
to my book.

your dog.

the sign?

09:41.481 --> 09:43.316
No. Sorry. I didn't.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.484
Oh.

All right, then.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.187
Thank you, Officer.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.427
I'll throw this away
for you.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.395
Have a great day.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.630
Thanks.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.601
You took...the poop.

is to serve and protect.

There's a sealed receptacle
in front of the Wells Fargo.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.011
I told you, I'm not sitting
next to the poop.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.981
Either the poop is in the front
and I am in the back

10:14.014 --> 10:16.884
or the poop is in the back
and I am in the front.

Look at him.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.988
So happy.

The only thing he loves
more than St. Patrick's Day

10:22.990 --> 10:24.424
is Kenny Rogers.

How can I tell him he's
been fired by the man he loves

10:26.626 --> 10:28.028
on the day he loves?

10:28.061 --> 10:30.130
Easy.
Don't tell him.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.464
We had a saying
in the Navy --

10:31.498 --> 10:33.133
"Don't ruin shore leave."

10:33.166 --> 10:34.601
Save it for the sea.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.336
Right. Yeah.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.537
Why ruin his St. Pat's?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.839
I'll tell him tomorrow.
All right.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.806
I've been so focused on Eddie,
I forgot about myself.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.976
What up, Ms. D.?

18:30.009 --> 18:32.011
Huang in the house!

18:32.044 --> 18:33.580
Did you get
your March Madness bracket

18:33.613 --> 18:35.148
turned in
to Mr. Carlson yet?

18:35.182 --> 18:37.850
I saw you took UNLV
to go all the way.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.586
Bold.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.588
Can I borrow my little bro
for five?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.089
Five?
No one talks for five.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.625
He's your blood.
Take 10.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.197
You forgot something
this morning.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.798
My essay!

18:51.831 --> 18:53.833
I had to go back home
because I forgot my wallet.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.303
Actually,
I forgot my whole book bag.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.704
Full disclosure --
I was wearing my swimsuit.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.206
I thought
it was Saturday.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.707
And I saw it
on the coffee table.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.175
You did this for me?

19:02.209 --> 19:03.710
But I've been such a jerk
to you.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.044
I'm still mad,

19:05.077 --> 19:07.814
but I know how important
homework is to you.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.650
I want to visit you at Stanford,
not Georgia Tech.

19:10.683 --> 19:11.751
Whoa.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.221
But what about
your school?

19:14.254 --> 19:17.123
Turns out Honor Society students
can roll in late to homeroom

19:17.156 --> 19:18.691
because the monitor
trusts them.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.959
If I'd known,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.829
I would have gotten one of these
years ago.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.131
I'm sorry
I underestimated you.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.700
I guess I liked knowing
you depended on me.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.537
I've grown up.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.639
I know it's hard,
little brother,

19:32.672 --> 19:34.307
but it's time.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.843
You need to let me go.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.177
Guess I do.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.179
But you were right
about one thing --

19:40.213 --> 19:42.982
I owe you a thank-you
for the Honor Society.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.584
Every good habit I have,

19:44.617 --> 19:46.586
I learned
from watching you.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.487
Pffft.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.021
As Marcus Aurelius said,

19:49.055 --> 19:53.159
"Waste no more time arguing
what a good man should be.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.894
Be one."

19:54.927 --> 19:56.195
Wow.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.730
You get that
from the dry

19:57.764 --> 19:59.632
From Marvin, who got it
from the dry-cleaner's sign.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.740
Good.
You're all here.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.611
I've revised my book,

20:11.644 --> 20:13.913
and I'm sending the new pages
to Vera.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.549
"Jennifer Hong
spots the cold, dead corpse

20:16.583 --> 20:19.218
spilling
out of its open bathrobe.

20:19.252 --> 20:23.356
Unafraid to show her humanity,
she vomits.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.592
Captain Pemberton-Giles smiles.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.427
'That's why she's the best.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.397
She hasn't forgotten
how to feel.'"

20:30.430 --> 20:31.531
-Hmm.
-Mm.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.532
It's good.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.234
Oh, I also revised
my author bio.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.569
"Jessica Huang --

20:36.603 --> 20:38.070
wife, mother,

20:38.104 --> 20:40.239
has seen a dead body."

20:45.645 --> 20:46.713
Morning, all!

20:46.746 --> 20:47.747
Slept through literally
all of yesterday,

20:47.780 --> 20:50.383
but today
I am feeling F-I-N-E fine.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.819
It's so odd -- I haven't heard
from Kenny in a while.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.588
He usually calls me
to wish me a happy St. Pat's.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.889
Uh, Matthew,

20:56.923 --> 20:59.492
how much do you remember
from St. Patrick's Day?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.294
I remember coming to work
in a taxi

21:01.328 --> 21:02.929
and dancing a jig

21:02.962 --> 21:04.597
and trading hats
with Mark the Bear,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.666
and after that,

21:06.699 --> 21:09.068
um...

21:09.101 --> 21:11.438
it's blur city, man.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.472
Oh.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.973
Um, sit down.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.274
Okay.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.012
I have to tell you
something...again.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.280
Uh, but before I start,

21:21.314 --> 21:22.915
just know
there is a happy ending.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.517
Oh, I already know
I got a tattoo there,

21:24.551 --> 21:25.418
and I'm okay with it.
