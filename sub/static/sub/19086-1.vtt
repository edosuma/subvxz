00:24.880 --> 00:29.590
Father, look kindly on your children
who put their trust in you.

00:29.680 --> 00:33.070
Bless them and keep them from all harm.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.516
Strengthen them against
the attacks of the devil.

00:36.600 --> 00:41.594
May they never offend you,
but seek to love you in all they do.

00:42.640 --> 00:47.350
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

00:47.440 --> 00:51.069
The Mass has ended.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.958
Thanks be to God.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.991
Good morning, Mary. How are you?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.790
Good morning, Elizabeth. How are you?

01:07.880 --> 01:09.677
Good morning, Bernie.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.991
Father, would you say a prayer
to Our Lady for an intervention?

01:13.080 --> 01:15.116
- What's wrong? Is someone sick?
- No.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.829
I just want us to pray for my daughter
to lose her driving licence.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.638
Case number 37422: Veronica Guerin.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.274
Almost 1 200 parking tickets.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.473
March 1 0th, speeding ticket.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.835
1 08 miles per hour.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.389
Just last month another speeding ticket
for driving at 1 04 miles per hour.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.917
Well, now, I think that shows
some improvement by my client, Judge.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.470
I'll alert mothers it's safe
to let their children back on the streets.

01:48.560 --> 01:54.476
I... I deserve to lose this case, Judge.
That's fair enough, you know.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.839
But if I can't drive, I can't do my job. I'm
a journalist with the Sunday Independent.

01:59.920 --> 02:05.472
We all know who you are, Miss Guerin.
That does not grant you immunity.

02:19.200 --> 02:25.435
This is Bernie Guerin. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please leave a message.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.715
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.076
He actually let me off.
I love you, Mum. Talk to you.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.311
Ah, no! You're having me on.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.949
No, I swear to God. Just a £1 00 fine
and a warning. I'm behind the wheel again.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.873
- It's your ma, the criminal.
- Hi, Ma.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.748
Well, I hope you've learned a lesson
and reformed your ways, young lady.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.796
- Hey, you're not speeding now, are you?
- No, of course I'm not.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.871
Well, maybe a little.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.439
What did you say to that daft judge?

02:56.520 --> 02:58.750
I told him I was guilty as sin.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.594
And he let you off?
Pleads a great case for judicial reform.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.434
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.190
This is Garda detective Chris Mulligan.
Please leave a message.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.398
You didn't get me this time, Chris.
Still got the wheels.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.314
I was fined - you're gonna love this -
1 00 quid. Can you believe it?

03:20.400 --> 03:24.439
You owe me lunch. You said wherever
I want, and I'm expensive, don't forget.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.592
Veronica?

03:33.480 --> 03:34.754
Veronica?

05:05.880 --> 05:08.348
The fucking eagle has landed.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.879
How are you, boss?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.515
Push off, you little scum.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.597
Come on, get your money ready. £5.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.031
How are you?

07:50.040 --> 07:54.830
The name's Veronica.
I write for the Sunday Independent.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.999
May I ask you some questions?
D'you mind?

08:03.320 --> 08:06.198
How much d'you pay for one of those?

08:06.280 --> 08:11.718
A few quid. Anyway, it's cheaper
to rent someone else's needle.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.711
What about the score?

08:14.480 --> 08:17.472
- First one's free.
- Well, I heard £5.

08:21.200 --> 08:26.228
- Where d'you get the cash for all this?
- I just say to some broad like you:

08:26.320 --> 08:30.871
"Give me your money
or I'll inject you with AlDS."

08:32.799 --> 08:36.190
- How old are you?
- What's it to you?

08:36.960 --> 08:40.395
I'm writing a piece for the paper.
I wanna know where you get the gear.

08:40.480 --> 08:45.793
I'll do your work for you.
Come back when you got some money.

08:51.440 --> 08:56.514
- Fatso, don't be spending that on food.
- I'll check it later.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.115
- Lost, are we?
- Who might you be?

09:00.200 --> 09:03.909
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah, well, better keep an eye out.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.390
I hear there's some dodgy scangers about.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.155
I fucking swear to God...

09:39.160 --> 09:42.038
Ah, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.036
You're an awful man, do you know that?

09:45.120 --> 09:49.318
What'd you have to go and shoot
your mouth off to the Gards about me for?

09:49.400 --> 09:52.995
Did you think I wouldn't find out it was you?

09:53.760 --> 09:57.548
You know, I was thinking about killing you.

09:58.400 --> 10:03.758
And then I thought to myself,
people get killed every day,

10:03.840 --> 10:06.115
and nobody gives a shite.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.636
So I've decided
I'm going to have to hurt you a bit.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.110
Actually, I'm going to hurt you an awful lot.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.233
But the good news is that I'm going to
do you meself. Oh, yeah. Personally.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.709
I mean, you don't want people thinking,

10:21.800 --> 10:25.395
just because I got me name
in the papers and all that,

10:25.480 --> 10:31.635
that Martin Cahill is too posh to do
his own dirty work, now, do you, huh?

10:39.160 --> 10:41.230
For fuck's sake...

10:41.320 --> 10:43.959
Take the gag out of his mouth.

10:44.040 --> 10:49.558
Let the little scumbag squeal.
It's what he's good at, isn't it? Squeal!

11:12.040 --> 11:14.031
Please...

11:37.680 --> 11:39.671
- I'm sorry!
- How are you?

11:40.320 --> 11:44.108
- You made lunch. Aren't you great?
- I must be.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.997
- Hi.
- Hi, Jimmy.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.072
Off to a big news story, are we?

11:51.160 --> 11:54.869
Come on, Ronnie. Give us a scoop.
Who's the scumbag of the week?

11:54.960 --> 11:58.669
Go and buy the paper, little brother.
You ready for me?

11:58.760 --> 12:02.753
- Did I say something?
- Don't look at me. She's your sister.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.149
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

12:13.240 --> 12:17.119
Night. Night, darling.
I'm in the other room if you need me.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.430
OK.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.875
He won't have any trouble sleeping tonight.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.554
That's cos you wore him out
on the football pitch.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.631
Yeah.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.391
- What's up?
- Nothing.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.594
Nothing or something?

12:37.680 --> 12:40.035
It's bollocks, what I'm writing.

12:40.120 --> 12:44.352
- Give yourself a bit of credit for a change.
- Whatever. So it's half-decent bollocks.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.273
It's light. It's human interest.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.351
It's bollocks.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.556
What a state, on the street.
There were needles everywhere.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.473
- Right where the kids were playing.
- Jesus.

12:56.560 --> 13:01.953
You should have seen these wankers.
Standing there with their new Mercedes.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.715
How many £5 hits of dope do you need
to shift in order to buy a new Mercedes?

13:05.800 --> 13:08.997
Do the math. How many kids is that?

13:10.240 --> 13:15.837
Nobody's writing about it. Nobody cares.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.798
Somebody needs
to get after these bastards.

13:18.880 --> 13:24.352
They're making megabucks.
That's what I should be writing about.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.989
That wouldn't be bollocks.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.838
The pushers are using the underage kids
to do their business.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.879
They know the Gards won't touch the kids.
Everyone knows what goes on here.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.999
Eight kids from this block alone
died from drugs last year. Eight.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.072
All of them under 1 5.
Four of them were me sister lris's kids.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.479
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.518
TDs, Gards, close their eyes,
call it a family problem.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.989
But for some families
these kids are dead already.

13:53.080 --> 13:57.517
So we formed Concerned Parents
Against Drugs, made it our problem.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.670
I'd appreciate it if you'd write about us.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.512
- How often do you march?
- Once a week.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.433
- It's quite a commitment.
- It's quite a problem.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.318
Hey. Do you remember me?

14:10.440 --> 14:14.433
- Were those Cahill's lads in the van?
- What van?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.714
She can help, Timmy.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.712
You know, Martin Cahill. The General.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.916
You know him?

14:23.760 --> 14:26.149
What's your cut?

14:29.160 --> 14:33.392
- I'd better go. I can't be seen with yous.
- Let us help you, Timmy.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.711
I can find you a good place
to stay tonight. Tomorrow...

14:36.800 --> 14:39.075
Do yous wanna have sex with me?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.389
I'm not expensive.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.272
- The bill, please.
- He nicked your wallet.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.797
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

14:53.880 --> 14:55.552
- When do we want them?
- Now!

14:55.640 --> 14:57.232
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

14:57.320 --> 14:59.993
- When do you want them?
- Now!

15:00.080 --> 15:02.310
Are these marches always this small?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.198
Hopefully, with your help,
the word'll get out to more people.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.430
Yeah, hopefully.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.080
I'll make sure it does.

15:13.920 --> 15:18.550
- Get out, Mullen!
- You bastard, Tommy Mullen!

15:22.440 --> 15:24.078
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

15:24.160 --> 15:25.479
- When do we want them?
- Now!

15:25.560 --> 15:27.198
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

15:27.280 --> 15:28.759
- When do we want them?
- Now!

15:28.840 --> 15:31.513
- Pusher, pusher, pusher!
- Out, out, out!

15:45.040 --> 15:48.430
Look who's got hisself a new girlfriend.

15:51.240 --> 15:55.870
- We'll see you there, then, John.
- Yeah, go on ahead.

15:55.960 --> 16:00.272
- What the hell do you want?
- Is that any way to talk to a lady?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.828
Ladies don't go calling
on gentleman unannounced.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.911
So we're a gentleman now, are we?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.356
Where's your manners?
You didn't introduce me to your friends.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.398
- If that's what you're after.
- You closing up early?

16:11.480 --> 16:14.040
One of the benefits of being self-employed.

16:14.120 --> 16:19.558
You're amazing, John.
No, really, you're a model of... profitability.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.599
How to succeed in business
without any customers.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.511
- I do well enough.
- Yeah, well...

16:25.600 --> 16:28.956
There must be a few bob
in those brothels there on Rathgar Road.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.600
What they worth now, John?

16:31.680 --> 16:36.196
- You're a dangerous little bitch.
- Ah, well. Do my best. Buy us a drink?

16:36.280 --> 16:41.718
It's the benefit of being self-employed,
John. You are your own boss, aren't you?

16:41.800 --> 16:46.078
You're way off the mark. Martin Cahill
isn't into the drugs. Neither am l.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.991
You sure?

16:48.080 --> 16:51.595
We're just ordinary, decent criminals.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.911
If you're not going to take my word for it,
why don't you ask Martin?

16:55.000 --> 17:00.393
- He's very fond of the ladies.
- Yeah, exactly. So set it up for me.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.958
Why are you chasing the drugs?
You should be after the pubs.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.430
- They do more damage than the drugs.
- Yeah, right.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.714
Yeah?

17:08.800 --> 17:12.031
No. I tried that. It was a dead end.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.791
Call you back? Grand.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.478
So how many guys
are you working for stories at once?

17:18.520 --> 17:21.318
A less generous person
might say you were ungrateful

17:21.400 --> 17:23.630
for what I gave you already.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.077
Stealing old paintings, kidnapping bankers'
families. You're above that now, are you?

17:28.160 --> 17:30.833
I got you famous with those stories.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.230
Yeah, you feed me superficial crap.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.551
- I make you look good.
- Great picture.

17:37.640 --> 17:42.316
Come on. I need your help to get to Cahill.
Write me a reference.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.789
I'm late for an appointment.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.470
Word of advice.
Stay away from Martin Cahill.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.316
Sorry to disturb you.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.837
Are you Mrs Cahill? Frances Cahill?

18:08.400 --> 18:10.391
Right.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.594
Are you Frances Cahill?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.148
- I am.
- Hi. I'm Veronica.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.119
- I'm a friend of John Traynor's.
- I know who you are.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.749
Is your husband home?
I just want to ask him a favour.

18:36.840 --> 18:40.753
Martin Cahill doesn't
do favours for journalists.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.432
So piss off.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.479
There's a rumour going about he's putting
drugs on the street. You got any comment?

18:46.560 --> 18:50.758
I know he nailed a tout to the floor of a flat
the other day. Was it drug-related?

18:50.840 --> 18:54.435
Look, I just want a brief comment.
Off the record.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.317
I'll be out of your...

18:56.400 --> 18:59.198
Mr Cahill! You couldn't
do me a favour, could you?

18:59.280 --> 19:02.989
I need the names of those kids
who are selling drugs for you.

19:03.080 --> 19:07.710
And I'll do you a favour. I won't write
what people are saying about you.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.475
You know, that you're having kids
with your wife's sisters.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.358
There's me number. Give me a call.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.151
Cheers.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.596
So, what can I do for you, Veronica?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.796
How could you lose a body?

19:30.800 --> 19:34.429
- That's just downright careless.
- You find some, you lose some.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.715
It'll turn up. Those bodies always do.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.791
So you gonna join those crying foul?

19:38.880 --> 19:41.917
"More Garda incompetence.
Is this why we pay our taxes?"

19:42.000 --> 19:46.949
Some might say it's incompetent, but
you could say it's that you're understaffed.

19:47.040 --> 19:52.956
Your hands are tied. You couldn't maintain
24-hour surveillance on that murder site.

19:53.040 --> 19:57.670
People should know that.
I mean, I think someone should write that.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.673
And if someone did write that,
what would that someone want in return?

20:01.760 --> 20:06.470
I talked to the couple you detained
after the weekend in Amsterdam.

20:06.560 --> 20:11.680
Held for 48 hours cos they bought
nothing there but a box of condoms.

20:11.760 --> 20:16.880
How does it feel to wait around for a mule
to shite out a condom full of drugs?

20:16.960 --> 20:21.272
You and I both know that the courier's
the lowest man in the organisation.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.558
Somewhere some Mr Big is sitting there,
laughing at you and your stool sample.

20:25.640 --> 20:29.428
You can't touch him. I want -
we both want - to get Mr Untouchable.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.511
What are you gonna do when you get him?

20:31.600 --> 20:35.070
Your paper's so scared
that some big criminal is gonna sue them,

20:35.160 --> 20:37.390
they employ more lawyers than journalists.

20:37.480 --> 20:41.473
Well, I mean,
there's more than 300,000 people.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.348
I don't want to blow my own trumpet,
but they know Martin Cahill's the General

20:45.440 --> 20:48.512
because, you know,
of what I write in the Sunday Independent.

20:48.600 --> 20:52.718
- At least they know what he's up to.
- Great, for your readers.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.109
But does it help me
put him behind bars, does it?

20:55.200 --> 20:58.158
We're on the same side, Chris.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.232
Now, I trained as an accountant, right?

21:01.320 --> 21:06.110
If I could have a look at these files,
then I could go after those other wankers.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.475
Put some pressure on them.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.551
Come on.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.158
Go on.

21:17.480 --> 21:22.554
Look, I've got some more packing to do.
I'll be back in an hour or so.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.076
Looking forward to reading
someone's column on Sunday.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.672
"For the Coach every day is lotto day."

21:39.400 --> 21:43.871
"What others might earn in a decade,
he can conjure up in an afternoon."

21:43.960 --> 21:48.636
"His Swiss scam was such a stroke,
a child of his remarkable ingenuity."

21:48.720 --> 21:51.234
"The fruits of a complex fraud..."

21:51.320 --> 21:53.390
- The Coach, boss.
- What?

21:56.320 --> 21:59.995
Never knew you were
such a horse lover, John.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.678
- What took you so long?
- The traffic.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.230
Nothing to do with that woman
who writes for the Sunday Indo?

22:10.320 --> 22:13.471
- Did the boys say something?
- That's not the question, Johnny.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.915
The question is:
what did you say to that woman?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.991
Nothing important.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.590
She fancies me, so I humour her.

22:21.680 --> 22:26.037
You know why I'm successful, Johnny?
I lead a quiet life.

22:26.120 --> 22:30.159
Nobody knows what I'm doing,
and that's very good for business.

22:30.240 --> 22:35.758
When you talk to that bitch and when she
writes about you, you feel like a movie star.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.436
Don't think she doesn't know
how to use that, because she does.

22:40.520 --> 22:45.435
You're not as smart as you think you are.
That makes you a liability.

22:45.520 --> 22:52.596
Remember this. If that bitch
ever mentions my name, you pay.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.870
You like playing the gangster, do you?

23:00.960 --> 23:05.750
Do you? It makes you feel like a big man.
Does it make you feel like a big man?

23:05.840 --> 23:10.675
How does it feel now?
Heap of shite! You heap of shite!

23:10.760 --> 23:13.115
- John, please...
- You bunch of eejits.

23:13.200 --> 23:18.354
Who's the fucking genius
messing with the gun around my horses?

23:18.440 --> 23:22.911
You don't insult me boys, Gerry.
You leave that to me.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.470
Unless you want
some of the same yourself.

23:30.520 --> 23:34.308
Word of advice.
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.189
I called you here
cos we've got a debt to settle.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.474
What debt?

23:39.560 --> 23:43.599
Your man Martin Cahill thinks
over half a million quid is owed him.

23:43.680 --> 23:47.389
I got him to loan us that money to start up
the operation. If he wants it back...

23:47.480 --> 23:50.438
As far as I'm concerned
that money keeps moving forward.

23:50.520 --> 23:55.594
He lent you the money when you were just
out of prison. Now he's down on his luck.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.831
He can't shift the paintings
from the last job. They're too hot.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.514
- Why don't you just pay him?
- No, no. You don't get it.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.593
When a scumbag like Cahill is down
on his luck, you kick him in the bollocks.

24:05.680 --> 24:09.036
Wouldn't try that with Martin Cahill.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.793
Whose side are you on, Coach?

24:13.320 --> 24:16.153
I just think we should make payment.

24:16.240 --> 24:20.518
Don't you worry about it.
We're gonna make payment.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.992
Jesus!

25:37.080 --> 25:39.230
Are you people fucking insane?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.153
For a few hundred grand,
you've murdered all of us.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.037
I don't like your tone, Coach.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.111
Maybe the Gards
don't know what you did

25:47.200 --> 25:49.316
but if the rest of the Cahill mob find out,

25:49.400 --> 25:53.837
they'll kill yous
and everyone you did business with.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.993
The lRA has claimed responsibility
for the murder of Martin Cahill.

25:58.080 --> 26:03.234
We are now doing everything in our power
to apprehend and identify the gunmen.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.311
At the moment,
no progress has been made.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.960
This isn't the first execution
we've seen all year.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.235
What progress has been
made on other cases?

26:10.320 --> 26:13.073
I cannot comment
on any other investigation at this time.

26:13.160 --> 26:16.118
Why is progress never made
on any cases involving the lRA?

26:16.200 --> 26:21.752
Cahill's family has stated that the General -
and I quote - "was not killed by the lRA,

26:21.840 --> 26:25.435
but because someone saw how much
money he made and wanted to take over."

26:25.520 --> 26:28.751
In your opinion,
could the murder be drug-related?

26:28.840 --> 26:33.197
- You can't believe everything you hear.
- Neither can you, Des.

26:42.240 --> 26:47.234
Look, Veronica, every journalist
sees a vast conspiracy in everything.

26:47.320 --> 26:51.359
We haven't a fucking clue about anything.
We just don't know who killed Cahill.

26:51.440 --> 26:56.468
Yeah, and you don't care, right? As long as
they kill each other, it's easier for all of you.

26:58.080 --> 27:02.153
Here. Let's sort out the petty criminals first.

27:02.880 --> 27:08.876
Those who loved Martin Cahill
feel a deep sense of loss and pain.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.120
Violence can only lead to death,

27:14.600 --> 27:19.037
because it's the way of hatred,
fear and revenge.

27:19.880 --> 27:23.316
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom come...

27:23.400 --> 27:27.188
Nothing like a funeral
to bring out the competition, is there?

27:27.280 --> 27:31.956
Look at Gerry Hutch there, all tearful.
Or should I say the Monk?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.998
He's not bad-looking, for a monk.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.753
The thing about monks,
though, is they're celibate.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.831
Supposedly.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.360
See those two there?
They're dealers, right?

27:44.440 --> 27:48.035
Oh, yeah.
Fatso Mitchell and Tommy Mullen.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.677
- Cahill wasn't running drugs.
- No?

27:54.760 --> 28:00.232
I followed the money and it turns out
your man was absolutely broke.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.959
- The family had to borrow 1 0,000 for this.
- Really?

28:03.040 --> 28:06.077
- Didn't have the cash to run drugs.
- For fuck's sakes.

28:06.160 --> 28:10.039
Will you look? The north side rivals
to pay their respects.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.948
That's Brian Meehan there.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.669
- The blond one?
- Yeah. Nasty little fucker.

28:17.760 --> 28:22.151
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.516
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.830
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

28:27.920 --> 28:34.393
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.549
Yeah?

28:40.640 --> 28:46.237
- The lRA didn't act alone.
- Tell me something I don't know.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.916
- Where are you?
- Gerry Hutch ordered the hit on Cahill.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.116
Hutch? Jesus, are you sure, now?

28:55.840 --> 28:57.717
I was there.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.471
She bought it.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.111
Boohoo!

29:17.080 --> 29:18.718
Boohoo!

29:22.880 --> 29:26.031
Get out of here now
or I'll put you out of your misery.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.315
OK. Let's bring him in.

29:36.880 --> 29:40.190
Right, strip him and search him.

29:40.280 --> 29:45.798
I'll get you. Your wife, your kids.
You think you're the big fella now?

29:45.880 --> 29:49.634
You'll not be so big
the next time you meet me with a bally on.

29:49.720 --> 29:54.191
Yeah? I'm trembling. We can do this
the hard way or the easy way. Your choice.

29:54.280 --> 29:57.192
Let's do it the hard way, huh?

29:57.280 --> 30:00.317
Do you like men with big cocks, do you?
D'you want that, do you?

30:00.400 --> 30:04.393
Is she a lesbian, is she?
You fancy me arse, don't you? You pervert.

30:04.480 --> 30:09.110
All right. Get your designer gear back on
and get the fuck out of my sight.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.510
There's over £600 there.
You can keep that.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.478
Yous fuckers need it more than I do.

30:16.240 --> 30:20.074
Bunch of fucking eejits,
working and paying taxes.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.517
D'you know what? I make more in a week
than yous fuckers earn in a month. Here.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.512
That's more than you earn in a year.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.596
Thanks. See you, guys. All the best.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.671
See you soon, Brian.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.235
I always like to go shopping after a funeral.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.514
- What are you doing here?
- It's looking bad for you.

30:50.600 --> 30:54.195
- People say you ordered the hit on Cahill.
- People can say what they like.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.113
I was out of the country at the time.

30:57.200 --> 31:02.558
Is that your response, Mr Hutch?
Or should I call you the Monk?

31:02.640 --> 31:05.518
You're invading my privacy
and the privacy of my family.

31:05.600 --> 31:10.276
So if you don't get the fuck off my property,
I'm gonna sue you and your fucking paper.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.351
Now fuck off!

31:14.640 --> 31:16.631
Can I quote you on that?

31:22.640 --> 31:24.631
I can't talk to anyone right now.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.518
It's Tony Gregory.
He's the MP for Dublin Central.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.957
I know who he is. I still can't talk to him.
Tell him to call back later.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.316
- You can tell him yourself.
- Hiya, Tony.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.516
What is this shite?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.114
It's lreland's finest newspaper, Tony.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.590
"Dublin city is currently
like a tinderbox just waiting to explode."

31:43.680 --> 31:47.559
- This sounds like self-fulfilling prophecy.
- It's a source quote.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.517
It's not me editorialising.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.353
No north inner-city gang
was involved in Cahill's murder.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.830
The gardaí have photos of these gangs
and no witnesses identified them.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.354
The only reason there isn't
a blood bath right now

31:58.440 --> 32:00.908
is because the Cahills
didn't buy your story.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.913
Now, as far as I am concerned,
this woman is reckless and inflammatory.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.877
She treats rumour as fact.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.793
And your newspaper is irresponsible
for publishing it.

32:09.880 --> 32:14.795
Now, I expect to read my response
over my breakfast next Sunday.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.675
- I did nothing wrong.
- I know. Did you corroborate your facts?

32:19.760 --> 32:23.594
I was told by a source who's never
been wrong before. I didn't name Hutch.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.559
I didn't even call him the Monk. I put it
to him. He said he was out of the country.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.837
He said he would sue us,
but he didn't deny it.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.037
- We know that.
- And the lawyers approved it, Aengus.

32:34.120 --> 32:38.272
We don't doubt you, Veronica. It's Gregory.
He's a Member of Parliament for the area.

32:38.360 --> 32:41.397
- He wants to have his say.
- I don't give a shite about that.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.948
What about the source?
He won't go on record?

32:44.040 --> 32:48.033
Course he won't. He's a criminal.
Jesus, this is like being a cop.

32:48.120 --> 32:53.069
Worse. You can't get a search warrant or
a wiretap but you have to prove everything.

32:53.160 --> 32:57.756
Yes. And you want to check
how reliable that source of yours is.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.351
Is Traynor about?

33:21.680 --> 33:25.195
- Jesus!
- Oh, sorry, John. Just a quick question.

33:25.280 --> 33:29.671
You're not aiming to start a gang war,
are you, between the Cahills and Hutch?

33:29.760 --> 33:32.797
- Jesus. She's famous.
- Shut up, you.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.873
I have a feeling you've been feeding me
a line of shite about the Monk.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.439
What are you talking about?

33:38.520 --> 33:42.752
Get the south and north side gangs to kill
each other so someone else can take over.

33:42.840 --> 33:46.515
You're talking out of your arse.
Get outta here. Unless you wanna join in.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.558
You told me you were there, John.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.633
- I've done you a lot of favours.
- I'm the one doing the favours.

33:53.720 --> 33:57.508
I've done you the favours! Don't forget that.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.070
I tell you what I know.
I don't tell you what to do with it.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.038
You come in here calling me a fucking liar!

34:04.120 --> 34:06.509
That's a bit of an overreaction there, John.

34:15.440 --> 34:20.116
- Why don't you come and have a pint?
- Too many journalists for me.

34:20.199 --> 34:23.590
You can't join a club
if you ignore the members, Veronica.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.672
I know what they say about me:
no journalistic experience,

34:26.760 --> 34:30.799
I'm exaggerating the drug problem,
my sources are unreliable, I can't spell.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.509
- Pretty accurate.
- I know I'm no great writer.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.672
Well, I think you're a poet, Veronica.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.271
Go on. Go on, Cantona!

34:45.040 --> 34:47.031
That's poetry.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.188
- What's the score?
- Nothing-nothing.

34:50.280 --> 34:55.308
Cantona's a fucking vacuum cleaner today,
man. It's unreal.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.957
He's what you call a striker.
Number seven. Watch him.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.315
A striker? What did you say his name was?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.595
Eric Cantona.

35:04.680 --> 35:07.672
Born 26th May 1 966.
Led Man United to six cups.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.558
Premier League footballer
of the year in '89. Is that him?

35:10.640 --> 35:14.110
Well, fuck me pink. I think it is, yeah.
Fair play to you.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.873
- I met him.
- You met Eric Cantona?

35:16.960 --> 35:19.838
- What did he say to you?
- Doesn't matter. He's a genius.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.388
He is a fucking genius, man. He's deadly.

35:24.800 --> 35:29.476
Look at that.
I bet you any money the Monk done that.

35:30.240 --> 35:35.553
Do you fancy going for a pint? There's
a great little pub down the road. Very quiet.

35:35.640 --> 35:39.110
That's almost three million quid.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.555
Where would you hide three million quid?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.154
How could you find any fun
in hiding three million?

35:44.240 --> 35:47.391
Wouldn't you be out on the town
spending it like a mad thing?

35:47.480 --> 35:50.278
Yeah. That's exactly right.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.197
- Good night. Thanks.
- So no pint, now?

35:55.160 --> 35:57.196
Not a chance?

36:04.520 --> 36:08.308
- Well done on the Brinks job, Gerry!
- What the fuck you doing following me?

36:08.400 --> 36:11.949
- I'm gonna write about it.
- I don't give a bollocks what you write.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.794
- What are you doing with the money?
- It's none of your business what I do.

36:15.880 --> 36:17.438
There you go.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.829
You know, I've forgotten my manners.

36:19.920 --> 36:24.516
You've been to my home.
Maybe it's about fucking time I visit yours.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.149
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Thanks. I'll see you again.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.877
- Night, Ma.
- Night, love.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.758
- What are you reading, Ma?
- Just some of me notes.

36:35.840 --> 36:39.799
- On the bad guys?
- No. There's just one bad guy I'm after.

36:39.880 --> 36:44.829
It's the one who's up way past his bedtime.
Now, let's go.

36:44.920 --> 36:49.516
You're getting much too big for
your old ma. I'll have to read you a story.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.111
Jesus.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.231
What the hell was that?

36:56.320 --> 36:58.709
- Stay there.
- All right.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.238
That's great. Thank you.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.152
Ronnie. We're all nervous.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.276
Ma's nervous, I'm nervous.

37:39.360 --> 37:42.158
Even Graham.
He just won't say anything about it.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.276
Everyone knows
it's no use talking to you.

37:44.360 --> 37:48.069
Jimmy, those people issue death threats
if their laundry's folded wrong.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.754
Ma! Ma, where did you put the candles?

37:50.840 --> 37:53.400
They're on top of the bread box!

37:54.080 --> 37:57.231
Ah, right.
Besides, it's not the first.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.949
You remember those religious fanatics
after the Bishop Casey story.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.429
There's always someone.
You get used to them.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.718
No, Ronnie, you get used to cold water,
not bullets. This is madness.

38:07.800 --> 38:11.395
You'd do the same. If you saw those kids
on the street, you would do the same.

38:11.480 --> 38:15.155
- Not if there was people shooting at me.
- Ma, look!

38:15.720 --> 38:19.713
- Cathal, that's great! Who gave you that?
- You and Dad.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.591
Yeah.

38:24.160 --> 38:28.153
I am listening, actually. Whoever did it
made sure I was not in the room.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.434
Could you do this? You're better at it.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.478
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Nothing to worry about?

38:35.560 --> 38:39.917
I'm the only Guerin in the phone book.
Who do you think they'll come after next?

38:40.000 --> 38:43.151
Don't flatter yourself, little brother.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.152
Are you going to dance on this
or are you gonna go fast on it?

38:46.240 --> 38:50.028
- Here, give someone else a go.
- Give me a turn!

39:26.880 --> 39:29.189
Are you coming to bed?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.588
- What?
- I know you can hear me. Coming to bed?

39:32.680 --> 39:34.432
I'll be along in a minute.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.874
Fine. Suit yourself.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.835
Turn it down. Turn it down!

39:48.120 --> 39:52.432
Come on. I love it. I love my work.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.910
I'm finally doing something
that can make a difference.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.594
What am I gonna do with you?

39:59.360 --> 40:01.078
- Oh, come on.
- No.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.756
OK.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.551
Come on, man.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.352
Come on. Good boy!

40:33.120 --> 40:35.111
Did we wake you up?

40:40.720 --> 40:45.430
What can I say?
I don't think Gerry Hutch is into drugs.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.592
The Brinks heist, probably.
But drugs is just not his scene.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.797
I understand, but I've been
tracking his movements.

40:51.880 --> 40:55.555
I just need to source the drugs.
The connection's easy. I need your help.

40:55.640 --> 41:00.316
- I need you to stop coming to my office.
- He's got the money.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.870
We're talking about a fella
with no visible source of income

41:03.960 --> 41:06.554
who paid tax on £2 million last year.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.438
It's laundered
through the government's tax amnesty.

41:09.520 --> 41:13.559
- He's got too much money not to be into it.
- In your esteemed journalistic opinion.

41:13.640 --> 41:17.394
I know you seized shipments from Cork.
It's coming from somewhere. Where?

41:17.480 --> 41:21.359
We've impounded drugs from
Liverpool, Scotland, Amsterdam, Pakistan.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.877
You're not the only one trying here, and
Hutch isn't the only one with dirty money.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.838
- Who else you got?
- I could name you a dozen.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.957
Here's the latest candidate,
just in from lnterpol.

41:32.040 --> 41:34.508
John Gilligan, one year
out of Portlaoise Prison.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.909
Can you tell me
how this Ballyfermot lowlife

41:37.000 --> 41:41.676
has £300,000 to launder in an Amsterdam
casino? You're the star journalist.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.876
Gilligan. Certainly keeps a low profile.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.075
Yeah?

41:45.160 --> 41:47.674
Hi, Aengus. Yeah, can you hold?

41:47.760 --> 41:49.557
- Can l...?
- Go on. It's a copy.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.517
- Great.
- Just go.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.591
I owe you lunch.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.112
No, run the Brinks story.
Just hold off on the drugs claim.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.510
What for? This stuff you sent is great.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.797
Just give me 24 hours.
I got a tip. This could be big.

42:04.880 --> 42:09.670
- I'm trusting you on this one, Veronica.
- Oh, aren't you great!

42:20.040 --> 42:22.429
Nice tan there, John!

42:24.080 --> 42:26.355
Hope there's no hard feelings between us.

42:26.440 --> 42:31.912
I'm not one to take a bullet
through my window personally.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.309
Get lost.

42:34.400 --> 42:37.392
I told you to be careful
with the likes of Gerry Hutch.

42:37.480 --> 42:41.792
But you didn't tell me
about a fella named Gilligan.

42:41.880 --> 42:42.835
Who?

42:42.920 --> 42:45.639
You provided him with a car
when he got out of prison.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.234
John Gilligan. Do you want me to spell it?

42:48.320 --> 42:51.676
I run a bleedin' garage.
I provide loads of cars to people.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.513
Hardly gonna remember
every one of them, now, am l?

42:54.600 --> 42:59.071
- Is that him there?
- Why should I give a shite?

42:59.160 --> 43:04.075
No reason, really. Just the fella behind
the security guard looks a lot like you.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.836
- Now, there's a coincidence.
- Where's his money coming from?

43:08.920 --> 43:11.195
Is he providing
hash and heroin to Mitchell?

43:11.280 --> 43:14.670
I can't help you, Veronica.
Don't know nothing about him.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.558
If I hear of anything,
I'll let you know, OK? Molly!

43:17.640 --> 43:21.633
You can keep the photo if you like.
It's a nice one of you. We got plenty.

43:26.280 --> 43:29.192
- You sell horses yourself?
- I do.

43:29.280 --> 43:33.398
- You have a number.
- I sell them on to Germany mostly.

43:33.480 --> 43:37.109
Myself and Geraldine are planning
to make this the largest and finest

43:37.200 --> 43:40.954
equestrian centre in all of lreland.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.237
Well, I must say the size is impressive.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.117
Said the nun to the sailor.

43:47.280 --> 43:52.957
How about an apéritif?
Some champers, caviar? It's all imported.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.191
John and I have great plans for this place.

43:56.280 --> 43:58.271
Hang on.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.551
Hello?

44:01.640 --> 44:02.868
- Hello?
- John...

44:02.960 --> 44:06.316
You're breaking up there. Hello?

44:06.400 --> 44:08.356
- It's Traynor.
- Johnny.

44:08.440 --> 44:12.592
Listen, Veronica Guerin's got hold of
a photo of us in Amsterdam.

44:12.680 --> 44:18.835
But, John, I swear I had nothing
to do with it. I never mentioned your name.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.911
But she was asking about you.

44:21.000 --> 44:26.950
Johnny, I told you before, if she so much
as mentions my fucking name, you pay.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.195
Fucking eejits!

44:32.280 --> 44:34.271
Fuck 'em!

44:39.360 --> 44:41.351
Happy Christmas!

44:43.960 --> 44:46.713
- Now, isn't this great?
- When's Mum coming here?

44:46.800 --> 44:50.429
She'll be here soon.
We'll want something stronger than that.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.715
Yeah? Ma, how are you?

44:57.800 --> 45:00.997
- Happy Christmas, Ann. You look great.
- Happy Christmas.

45:01.080 --> 45:04.789
- Where's your mum?
- You know her. Always going for the gold.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.511
All right.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.352
There's someone at the door, Ma.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.830
My phone'll be on all night.
You can call me whenever you want.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.912
I love you too. OK. Bye. Bye.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.555
Yeah, all right, all right.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.349
Veronica's been shot!

46:40.160 --> 46:41.149
How are you?

46:41.240 --> 46:43.435
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous.

46:43.520 --> 46:46.990
- Look at you. For God's sake.
- Hey, Willy.

46:48.400 --> 46:51.153
Can't find any sport on. Can you believe it?

46:51.240 --> 46:54.949
..extensive investigations
into organised crime in Dublin...

46:55.040 --> 46:58.476
Why do they always use
that brutal picture?

46:58.560 --> 47:00.312
It was a very serious incident.

47:00.400 --> 47:04.188
Veronica Guerin
is a very talented journalist.

47:04.280 --> 47:08.159
An attack like this could be seen
as an attempt to muzzle her

47:08.240 --> 47:12.995
because of certain publications
or articles she wrote.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.277
This would be connected
with last month's £3 million robbery?

47:16.360 --> 47:19.830
We all know who pulled that one,
don't we, Hutch? He threatened me.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.469
Veronica, please, stop this.
Write about fashion, about football.

47:23.560 --> 47:27.519
Write about anything you like, but stop this.
You don't have to do it any more.

47:27.600 --> 47:32.515
I don't see myself covering the catwalks
or doing a gardening column, Aengus.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.512
You've always wanted
to write about politics.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.795
I am. Drugs are political.

47:37.880 --> 47:40.713
What if I told you
I wouldn't publish your stuff any more?

47:40.800 --> 47:42.597
But you never would tell me that.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.399
For Christ's sake, there's no sport channel.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.119
- We have to go.
- What kind of hospital is this?

47:48.200 --> 47:50.668
Is this what we pay health insurance for?

47:50.760 --> 47:53.433
- Where Cathal?
- He's at your sister's with your mum.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.351
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.953
Right. We've just got you
24-hour police protection.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.031
- OK?
- Grand.

48:02.080 --> 48:06.631
What a way to spend Christmas Eve,
looking at the poxy box.

48:06.720 --> 48:09.439
Mary Poppins. Gone with the Wind.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.149
Next thing you know
it'll be A Wonderful fucking Life.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.879
The doctor says it missed
the artery and the bone.

48:15.960 --> 48:20.192
Point-blank range
with a.45, and this is all they could do.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.748
- Where's Cathal? How is he?
- He's fine.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.832
Where is he? Oh, yeah. He's with Mum.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.832
- Yeah. He keeps asking for you.
- Yeah?

48:30.640 --> 48:34.155
-..shooting happened shortly after...
-..investigations for the...

48:34.240 --> 48:36.800
..warning from a crime gang.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.151
You gonna stop this now?

48:56.440 --> 48:58.635
Nan, look! It's Mum!

49:14.480 --> 49:17.517
- Give me the keys.
- I know what I'm doing, Graham.

49:17.600 --> 49:21.752
- They shot me cos I'm on the right track.
- Give me the keys, please.

49:21.840 --> 49:24.400
- Thank you.
- Would you give me the keys?

49:24.480 --> 49:26.232
No.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.709
Look at the state of you.

49:30.480 --> 49:33.040
Do you think I want to do this, do you?

49:33.120 --> 49:36.078
I don't want to do it. I have to do it.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.869
You're a journalist. You write.
You let the Gards look after this.

49:39.960 --> 49:44.078
Oh, Graham, come off it. The Gards
can't do anything. They'll get away with it.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.515
- 1 4 shootings in 1 4 months.
- You're one of them.

49:46.600 --> 49:49.398
I know who the guys are.
Would you just give me the keys?

49:49.480 --> 49:52.392
No. Tough shit.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.074
Come on inside. Please.

49:55.160 --> 49:58.596
They're not getting away with it.
I'll catch a cab, then.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.671
Oh, for God's sake.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.671
Ah, Jesus Christ.

50:05.640 --> 50:08.108
Yeah, hi. It's Veronica Guerin. I'd like a...

50:08.200 --> 50:11.112
Thank you. Come on. Get in.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.878
- Who's driving?
- You can't drive with two good legs.

50:14.960 --> 50:18.157
- You think I'll let you drive with one?
- That's low, that is.

50:18.240 --> 50:23.189
- You drive like an old granny.
- Come on, Hopalong, get in.

50:24.040 --> 50:27.396
Where is she going? She only got out
the hospital a couple of days ago.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.471
I know.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.791
You let me do it.

50:47.280 --> 50:51.717
Look! Veronica Guerin.
Come here. Have a look.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.791
Tommy Mullen?

51:07.720 --> 51:09.438
Fatso Mitchell?

51:10.360 --> 51:12.749
- Yeah.
- This is for you.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.391
Get the fuck out of here. Here!

51:22.800 --> 51:27.316
- Your column's upsetting me mother.
- Ah, you poor fella.

51:27.400 --> 51:32.235
You think I'm a drug dealer, don't you?
Well, I'm no drug dealer.

51:32.320 --> 51:36.996
I've seen family and friends dying
week in, week out because of 'em.

51:37.080 --> 51:40.311
All right. Why did you shoot me?

51:42.840 --> 51:47.311
No, I had nothing to do with shooting you.
I wouldn't have missed.

51:54.800 --> 51:57.633
I'm telling you, he isn't here.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.632
And I have to go. I'm busy.

52:00.720 --> 52:03.439
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

52:03.520 --> 52:06.512
Please, just give this to Traynor.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.633
Are you gonna be OK?
I mean, your leg and all?

52:10.720 --> 52:12.950
Yeah, I'm grand.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.995
Are you gonna be all right?

52:20.680 --> 52:25.231
And I thought... I mean, I've always
believed that... Well, I'm a journalist.

52:25.320 --> 52:30.110
Nobody shoots the messenger.
I mean, a journalist doesn't get shot.

52:30.200 --> 52:34.478
If the bullet had hit an artery,
you could have died.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.233
So why do you do it?
Why do you take the risks?

52:37.320 --> 52:43.714
Well, I'll give her this. It takes some balls
to shoot yourself in the leg for publicity.

52:43.800 --> 52:47.236
- She should have shot herself in the balls.
- Bigger target.

52:47.320 --> 52:51.632
- Shall we?
- Never liked this place anyway.

52:51.720 --> 52:57.192
She can always use the insurance money
for a course in journalism.

53:11.520 --> 53:14.193
Here. Check this out.

53:14.280 --> 53:17.875
..bringing to the attention
of the public generally

53:17.960 --> 53:22.988
a culture that exists in our society
that nobody knows anything about.

53:23.080 --> 53:25.878
Your girlfriend's looking
very fucking healthy.

53:25.960 --> 53:28.235
Too bad the moron you hired
shot her in the leg.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.710
Now the whole country's watching her,
thanks to you.

53:31.800 --> 53:35.349
She's a real martyr, thanks to you, Coach.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.352
Saint Veronica of the Sunday Independent.

53:38.440 --> 53:43.719
Relax, will you? She's convinced
it was Gerry Hutch that done it.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.394
You better pray she stays that way.

53:46.480 --> 53:48.596
Come on.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.035
Champagne - now.

53:51.120 --> 53:55.238
These letters that you delivered.
What did you say in them?

53:55.320 --> 53:57.914
There was one simple question
on each of the letters,

53:58.000 --> 54:01.993
and it was
"Were you responsible for my attack?"

54:13.080 --> 54:15.071
Mr Gregory?

54:15.160 --> 54:19.073
What are you doing here? How did you get
past Security? You can't just barge in.

54:19.160 --> 54:22.038
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I sit down?

54:22.840 --> 54:27.789
A young woman wounded, on a crutch.
I'd be at a disadvantage. Take a seat.

54:27.880 --> 54:31.156
I've come to apologise,
if I've got it all wrong.

54:31.240 --> 54:34.630
All of you journalists have got it wrong.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.960
You call these guys the Viper,
the Monk, the General.

54:38.040 --> 54:40.270
You glorify them. They're not movie stars.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.954
With respect, I've no option.

54:43.040 --> 54:46.237
I can't name them.
Your libel laws won't let me.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.880
Journalists are going to jail
for doing their job.

54:48.960 --> 54:52.635
Liz Allen, she's facing imprisonment
for exposing these murderers.

54:52.720 --> 54:55.439
I'm not getting involved
in your personal vendettas.

54:55.520 --> 54:59.069
- I'm not here because I was shot.
- Now we know what you're not here for.

54:59.160 --> 55:04.678
Look, I've been writing quite extensively,
in a balanced way, for the past 1 8 months.

55:04.760 --> 55:09.993
You must have missed some of my articles.
On June 1 1 th - I just want to clarify this -

55:10.080 --> 55:13.550
I suggested extending
detention periods for drug offenders.

55:13.640 --> 55:17.679
Then on July 1 6th I wrote about
tax officials - I mean, this is ridiculous -

55:17.760 --> 55:20.593
saying that they are paid
only to record declared income,

55:20.680 --> 55:23.353
not to worry about
whether it comes from drugs.

55:23.440 --> 55:26.034
Then on July 23rd
I wrote about the gardaí.

55:26.120 --> 55:30.750
They can seize drug proceeds but can't
hold them. How frustrating is that?

55:30.840 --> 55:34.958
I don't need you to tell me the fight against
drugs has been hampered, crippled,

55:35.040 --> 55:37.600
by the laws that we have at the moment.

55:37.680 --> 55:41.832
- We're on the same side, Mr Gregory.
- We're on the same side?

55:41.920 --> 55:45.754
I don't like your methods,
and I do not like your paper.

55:45.840 --> 55:50.231
Yeah. It's a rag. But it's a popular rag.

55:50.320 --> 55:52.959
Use it. Get your message out. Use me.

55:53.040 --> 55:56.032
You've got to change these laws
that favour the criminals.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.874
When do we get to the part where
you use me? Or is this just a charity offer?

55:59.960 --> 56:05.353
Well, I'm looking into a guy called Gilligan.
Just take my phone calls.

56:10.880 --> 56:13.269
Gilligan, did you say?

56:13.360 --> 56:16.796
Friend of mine said he rents these
containers out. Seen him about much?

56:16.880 --> 56:19.997
Slightly overweight, like? Bald guy?

56:20.080 --> 56:22.514
We've never seen him here.

56:22.600 --> 56:25.068
- Thanks for the smoke.
- Yeah.

56:30.720 --> 56:36.033
Willy, do me a favour, will you? Find out
how long Tony Gregory'll be in his office.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.395
Hiya. Look, no offence,

56:38.480 --> 56:42.917
but these guys are not gonna talk to me
with the cops hanging about. All right?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.355
- Right.
- Thanks. It's not working.

56:45.440 --> 56:50.036
Gilligan's listed here as living
in a council flat on the dole.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.156
That's just a mailing address.

56:52.240 --> 56:57.473
Those lads go to meetings with their
probation officers in BMWs and Mercedes.

56:57.560 --> 57:00.950
Having money isn't a probation violation.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.713
It is if the assets are illegal.

57:03.800 --> 57:08.316
Now, then I'd like to see a register
of ownership for the following properties,

57:08.400 --> 57:12.313
and this corporation here,
with a copy of the shareholders reports.

57:12.400 --> 57:16.359
And the same for these other companies
run by a man named John Gilligan.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.879
I told you, this office is closed for lunch,

57:26.960 --> 57:30.635
so unless you're on staff or with
the government, it's always closed to you.

57:30.720 --> 57:33.598
Not a problem. I've got a friend
who'd like to talk to you.

57:33.680 --> 57:35.750
Do you know Tony Gregory?

57:55.280 --> 57:57.714
Oh, you're an angel.

57:57.800 --> 58:01.634
- I'm just finishing up.
- You're a bad liar.

58:01.720 --> 58:03.870
Oh, God.
You make the worst cup of coffee.

58:03.960 --> 58:07.350
Here. I'll help you put Cathal to bed.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.829
He's been asleep for an hour.

58:11.080 --> 58:13.071
Of course.

58:15.640 --> 58:21.237
Don't you ever just wanna keep him
in the house? Not let him out ever?

58:21.320 --> 58:24.790
Yeah. But mostly I feel that way about you.

58:32.120 --> 58:35.795
I've got him, Graham. I've got his name.

58:36.680 --> 58:40.150
I'm gonna get this Gilligan bastard.

58:40.240 --> 58:43.437
I am so close, you know. I'm this close.

58:47.720 --> 58:50.154
Do you trust me?

58:50.240 --> 58:51.673
Right?

58:51.760 --> 58:53.751
Don't worry.

58:55.040 --> 58:57.429
Easy for you to say.

59:49.680 --> 59:53.309
How are you? Do you know
where I might find Mr Gilligan?

59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.198
- Sorry. Don't know.
- Right.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.790
Mr Gilligan? I'm Veronica Guerin
from the Sunday Independent.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.917
I've come to ask some questions
about your property ownership,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.120
including this lovely
equestrian centre you've got here.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.272
You could start by telling me
where you get the money.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.513
Cunt! Cunt!

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.991
Cunt!

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.709
Cunt! Cunt!

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.591
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No! No!

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.748
Get off my property, you cunt!

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.515
Jesus! Jesus, what happened to you?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.195
What happened to you, darling? God! God!

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.271
What happened to you?

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.598
Oh, my darling. Oh, my darling.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.556
Can you see it all?

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.631
Right.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.394
- Are you ready to go home?
- Yeah.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.677
- You wanna try a drop of that?
- Thanks.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.238
Look, it's up to you, Ronnie,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.598
but if you do press charges,
writing their story might prejudice the case.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.955
I know you. You just want to steal it.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.508
Of course I do. I'm a reporter.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:37.198
So what's it to be, Veronica? Do you want
the story or do you want to press charges?

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.671
Yeah?

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.191
This is John Gilligan.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.669
If you do one thing on me,

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.312
if you go to the gardaí or write about me,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.319
I'm gonna kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.431
I'm gonna shoot you.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.232
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.758
I'm gonna fucking kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.229
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.594
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.631
- Veronica.
- Where's Cathal?

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.233
- What's wrong?
- Where's Cathal?

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.278
He's in the country.
He's with your sister. He's safe.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.351
Jesus.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.475
- It was him.
- What?

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.758
I should never have gone there. Oh, Jesus!

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.231
- I'm so scared, Graham. I'm really scared.
- I know, I know, I know.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.515
It's going to be all right.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.715
- I want you to promise me something.
- What?

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.993
- Don't tell anyone I was like this.
- What?

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.275
All right?

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.796
- I don't want them to have it.
- All right.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.394
That's what they want more than anything.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.552
I promise you. You were never afraid.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.518
All right. Oh, Jesus.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.591
Never afraid.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.558
Jesus, Veronica. Look at you.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.710
I'll live.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.836
How are you, John?

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.356
It's... been a while.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.431
I'm grand. Get you a drink?

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.750
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.832
So, what do you want to talk about?

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.917
- I've a message for you from John Gilligan.
- The man you don't know.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.870
As soon as I heard, I went to see him.
I told him he'd got it all wrong.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.679
He's a small man with a chip. You know.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.752
He's got a temper. He just lost his head.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.310
Anyway, he wants you to know
that he's sorry for what he done,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.359
and for what he said
about your kid and the family.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.829
He'd never do those things.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.594
He wishes he could take it back.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.678
Gilligan got you to feed me
that shite about Hutch.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.436
Yeah. He murdered Cahill, stepped back
and let the lRA take credit.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.672
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here because he wants this to end

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.035
before things get any worse.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.429
How can it get any worse?

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.990
Things can always get worse, Veronica.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:29.478
Now, if you don't press charges,
you'll be £1 00,000 richer within an hour.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.032
It's not enough. I want 300.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.558
- I think I could get you that.
- Right.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.313
You tell Gilligan that
he's not gonna be buying me off.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.678
Nobody's trying to buy you off.
The man just wants to be fair, that's all.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.320
Even if he's convicted,
all he'll get is six months.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.109
Right, well, if he's not worried,
why is he prepared to pay so much?

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.397
Why did he bother sending a messenger?

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:06.795
You're not the Coach at all,
are you, Johnny?

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.155
You're the ball boy.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.631
What are you doing,
talking to her like this, after what you did?

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.553
What the fuck are you doing here?
Get out of here.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.474
- He sent that man to shoot you.
- That's a load of bollocks.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.993
- Don't listen to this junkie slag.
- It's true.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.710
He said the man was supposed to shoot
you in the head, but the gun didn't work.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.392
Veronica!

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.834
I've decided to make a formal complaint
against the guy who beat me.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.835
I mean, I would... I would lose a lot,

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.277
right, if I was to give in to these thugs,
and I'm not going to be doing that,

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.715
because it'd be worse for me
and for journalism

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.634
if I or any journalist was to be intimidated.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.631
That means they've won.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.075
And they're not going to win.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.515
Fuck off!

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.877
"The house shuddered and collapsed,

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.154
and then the little people discovered

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.518
that they were disappearing
into a swirl of leaves."

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.551
He's fast asleep.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.790
Thanks for watching him, Ma.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.237
What should a girl wear to court?
Maybe the navy.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.718
- This one looks grand.
- Oh, look.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.279
Ah, look at that.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.678
Look at you always trying
to be better than the boys.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:23.952
That reminds me, you know, of a day -
I don't know how old you were.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.238
You were out playing football and the ball
went over the wall into Old Man Clancy's.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.199
Do you remember him? He was
a very dangerous man. Very violent.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.078
The boys did nothing,
but you, bold as brass,

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.517
you marched up those steps
and you just knocked on his door.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.388
- Scared the bejasus out of me.
- You didn't show it.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.359
That's your thing, isn't it?
You don't show your fear.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:53.629
You know, Veronica, sometimes it's wiser
to let the crazy old man keep the ball.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.918
It is, and sometimes
it's braver to just walk away.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.151
Well, I got the ball back, didn't l?

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.038
You know exactly what I mean.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:31.910
In response to a motion by the defence,
I'm granting an extension until June 30th.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.231
- This hearing is adjourned.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.356
Hey. You haven't seen
the last of us, missis.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.793
Cheers.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.556
You all right?

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.279
I've got a speeding issue
to deal with tomorrow.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.432
You're big in Naas. You haven't
bought off any judges, have you?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.999
- Who is it?
- Ballaugh.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.631
Can't help you. I hope you didn't take
what that junkie slag said seriously.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.393
Her brain burned out months ago.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.359
And you didn't call me here
to talk about a speeding ticket.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.238
Changed your mind about Gilligan's offer?

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.198
I'm writing a story.
Just want to clear some things up.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.432
- You're my man.
- What do you wanna know?

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:53.479
How you guys launder all the money
you're making from the drug deals.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.757
- Is it the Amsterdam casinos?
- Are you saying I'm a drug dealer?

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:02.119
Would you talk straight to me? The two car
franchises, the yacht, the house, holidays.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.637
All that comes from the brothels? Don't the
taxmen ask where the money comes from?

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.759
You think I'd threaten those tax fellas?
That's bullshit. I was with me accountant.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.436
The taxman was very fair.
I'm legit. They can't touch me.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.235
Who shot me, John?

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:24.157
- You know as well as I do, Veronica.
- Yeah. I need to hear it from you.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.231
Gerry Hutch.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.632
I'm one of the only people in Dublin who
knows who did 90% of the hits last year.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.396
- Cos you're Gilligan's partner, right?
- Look, I'm a fairly minor player.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.710
You've seen Gilligan's house.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.078
He has a two or three million fucking horse
shed out the front that'll hold 8,000 people.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.958
I'm not in his league.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.909
So why are you asking me all
these questions? What's the story about?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.991
You.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.158
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.152
I'm gonna say you're a dealer,
name you, quote you on Hutch.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.629
- You can't do that, Veronica.
- I think I can.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.837
- You do that and I'm a fucking dead man.
- You poor fella.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.595
Listen to me, Veronica,
I'm trying to fucking help you.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.878
Take Gilligan's offer. I can't control him,
and you don't know how far he'll go

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.951
to keep from going back to prison.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.429
I came with a photographer from the paper.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.798
He's standing over there
next to the police. Smile.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.556
Let go of my door, John.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.430
Hello? Just a minute. Hello?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.073
She'll be at the Naas Courthouse
tomorrow morning.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.990
Come the fuck with me. Go on.

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.710
£1 00 fine.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.111
Thank you.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.232
Well done.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.431
She's out.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.075
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.436
He actually let me off.
I love you. Talk to you.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.833
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.915
She's on her way.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.069
I told him I was guilty as sin.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.431
Veronica?

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.236
Veronica?

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.388
Veronica Guerin's writing
turned the tide in the drug war.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.473
Her murder galvanised lreland into action.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.792
Thousands of people took to the streets
in weekly anti-drug marches,

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:30.353
which drove the dealers out of Dublin
and forced the drug barons underground.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.238
Within a week of her death, during
an emergency session of Parliament,

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.790
the government altered the constitution
of the Republic of lreland

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.671
to allow the high court to freeze
the assets of suspected drug barons.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.878
That same year, the Criminal
Assets Bureau, CAB, was formed

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.951
and given the power to access and seize

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.033
unexplained wealth
from suspected criminals.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.318
Charles Bowden turned state's evidence
and became the first person in lrish history

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.871
to be entered into
the witness protection programme.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.149
Brian Meehan was sentenced
to life imprisonment

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.231
for the murder of Veronica Guerin,

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.312
and his assets were seized by the CAB.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.588
Eugene Holland was sentenced
to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.148
His assets were seized by CAB.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.711
John Traynor escaped to Portugal

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.509
and continues to fight extradition
to lreland on charges of murder.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:23.592
His assets were seized by the CAB.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.797
After a long extradition battle,

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:40.599
John Gilligan was brought back to lreland
from England

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.468
and sentenced to
28 years in prison for drug trafficking.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.028
His assets were seized by CAB.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:56.998
By the following year,
crime rates had dropped 1 5%.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.711
Everyone in the Republic of lreland
remembers where they were

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:14.511
when they heard that Veronica Guerin
had been murdered on the Naas Road.
