[grunting]

00:47.923 --> 00:49.925
[grunting]

00:50.008 --> 00:52.386
Ugh! Why won't the shadow staff
make a portal?

00:52.469 --> 00:57.182
Slow down, young one. You must learn
to empower the staff itself.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.768
Focus, imbue it with your will.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.354
The stronger the emotions, the greater--

01:02.437 --> 01:04.982
[grunts] I don't get it.
Claire just joined the team,

01:05.065 --> 01:08.068
and she gets to handle
the super-sweet, megamatic portal staff?

01:08.151 --> 01:09.945
[grunts, groans]

01:10.028 --> 01:13.907
Pfft! I've been by Jim's side
since day one and what do I get?

01:13.991 --> 01:15.576
-[grunts]
-Careful now.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.911
Mmm... Got me, wingman.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.622
-Aw, buddy!
-[grunting]

01:20.706 --> 01:24.251
The shadow staff is a weapon
of great-- Whoa! ...power.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.503
-Ah!
-Ee-yah!

01:26.586 --> 01:28.297
-[grunts]
-[both chuckle]

-[chuckling]

01:31.550 --> 01:33.719
[grunting]
Why won't this thing work?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.054
She did it!

01:36.138 --> 01:38.890
No way! How did she do that?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.893
Whoa! I made a portal!

01:41.977 --> 01:43.603
Did you see that? I made a portal!

01:43.687 --> 01:46.356
Yeah, if we need to teleport an olive
or a baby mouse.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.233
-Oops! [chuckles]
-What did you just say?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.736
I said you have an awesome staff
and you totally deserve it.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.571
Even though you lost the Killstone.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.073
[scoffs]
Excuse me, Mr. God King,

01:55.157 --> 01:57.868
you were the one in charge
of getting the stone and you blew it!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.453
Uh, should we stop them?

01:59.536 --> 02:03.165
Uh... nah. This is the Forge.
Let them spar.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.708
-[Toby yelps]
-And if Jim were here--

02:04.791 --> 02:06.627
But Jim's not here.
You know where he is?

02:06.710 --> 02:09.963
Jim's getting chewed out right now
by ghosts because of your butterfingers!

02:10.047 --> 02:11.214
-[grunts]
-[coughs]

02:12.049 --> 02:13.050
We'll get it back.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.926
[male voice] <i>You said your friends</i>
<i>would make you stronger!</i>

02:15.010 --> 02:17.304
-It's one setback!
-[female voice] <i>Setback?</i>

02:17.387 --> 02:19.598
[male voice 1]
<i>Angor Rot will carve him to pieces!</i>

02:19.681 --> 02:22.100
-[male voice 2] <i>Is he stupid?</i>
-[male voice 3] <i>Worse. Naive.</i>

02:22.184 --> 02:23.727
They are right.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.898
You are too focused on your fight
tomorrow, not the fight today.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.735
He's killed Trollhunters before.
That means some of you can help me.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.571
[male voice]
<i>When Angor kills his prey...</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:36.782
[female voice]
<i>And he always does.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:39.868
[male voice]
<i>Their soul is devoured.</i>

02:40.952 --> 02:46.291
It is true. Those defeated by his hand
are gone forever.

02:46.375 --> 02:50.754
We were once concerned your devotion
would get your team killed.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.508
We now fear it is your team
that will get you killed.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.552
And who you calling "newbie"?

02:57.636 --> 03:00.305
I've been eaten by a troll.
What have you done?

03:00.389 --> 03:02.849
-I've been keeping your butt alive!
-[grunts]

03:02.933 --> 03:05.310
Oh, yeah? Well, I've been there
for Jim since the beginning.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.732
[gasps]
Get down!

03:11.817 --> 03:14.694
Oh, my gosh, Jim! I-I didn't mean to!

03:14.778 --> 03:16.238
Jim, she tried to kill me!

03:16.321 --> 03:20.909
-Stop! Enough! The council was right.
-What did my father say?

03:20.992 --> 03:23.161
He said that we need to step it up.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.373
And that's not just coming from him.
That's coming from me, too.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.667
Our task ahead just got harder.

03:28.750 --> 03:33.171
If we want all the stones,
the path now goes through Angor Rot.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.800
And we all know what that means.
Even the council doesn't know to stop him.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.679
We all need to pull our weight
and that goes for me, too.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.306
That means more training, work harder--

03:43.390 --> 03:44.641
I'll do whatever it takes.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.268
[scoffs]
Brown-noser.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.520
<i>We'll </i> do whatever it takes.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.189
But if rookie here gets to rock
a sweet weapon,

03:51.273 --> 03:53.275
I get to rock a sweet weapon, too!

03:53.358 --> 03:56.611
[humming]
Oh.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.242
[gasps]

04:02.325 --> 04:03.410
Warhammer!

04:05.036 --> 04:06.913
[grunting]

04:06.997 --> 04:10.000
One second! Wait for it!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.334
[grunts]

04:11.835 --> 04:13.754
See?
[grunting]

04:13.837 --> 04:16.339
It's not that heavy.
[grunting]

04:16.423 --> 04:17.798
[female voice]
Troll-- Troll--

04:17.882 --> 04:22.095
-Trollhunter, it's urgent!
-What is it? Is everything okay?

04:22.179 --> 04:26.016
I have a package I need delivered
to my sister, Sagdwella!

04:26.099 --> 04:29.102
She lives under a trailer park in Oo-tah.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.480
Wait a minute.
You want me to mail something?

04:31.563 --> 04:34.900
Your post office is more efficient
than our carrier mice trolls.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.652
I suppose they don't eat
the parcels either.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.863
You're supposed to answer every call.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.574
I don't think mail is what
the Trollhunters had in mind.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.410
-This is a call.
-[sighs] Fine.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.037
Jim the mailman? Why not?

04:47.120 --> 04:52.209
The address.
Whatever you do, do not open it!

04:52.292 --> 04:54.586
I've got my eye on you.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.172
[giggling]

04:57.255 --> 04:59.424
-[sighs]
-[Toby grunting]

04:59.508 --> 05:01.676
Hey, Jim, look at me!

05:01.760 --> 05:04.638
I got it! I got it!

05:04.721 --> 05:08.141
I don't got it! I don't got it!
I don't got it, I don't got it, I--

05:08.225 --> 05:11.102
-[loud crash]
-[groans] Ooh, everything hurts.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.021
So, what's in the box?

05:13.104 --> 05:15.106
It doesn't matter.
We're not gonna open it.

05:15.190 --> 05:18.610
Yeah, Claire, it doesn't matter.
But aren't you curious, though?

05:18.693 --> 05:21.530
There could be, like, a tiny creature
in there that can't breathe, Jimbo!

05:21.613 --> 05:24.741
Or an itty-bitty troll king
whose little kingdom needs saving!

05:24.825 --> 05:25.826
[gasps]

05:28.787 --> 05:31.957
Oh! Or my soulmate!

05:32.040 --> 05:36.461
Guys, it doesn't matter because, at lunch,
I'm taking it straight to the post office.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.837
Easy win, for once.

05:37.921 --> 05:42.717
What? You think you're gonna win today,
Lame Junior?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.512
The Touch-A-Truck-athon is mine.

05:45.595 --> 05:49.766
It's the ultimate test of endurance,
and no one can touch like me.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.477
-Am I right, Claire?
-Ugh, in your dreams.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.979
[imitates explosion]

05:54.062 --> 05:56.439
-[chuckles]
-Aw, poor Steve.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.774
I think he's becoming unhinged.

05:57.857 --> 06:02.487
Oh, man, the Truck-athon's today?
That's gonna take all day!

06:02.571 --> 06:04.823
Then let me deliver the package.
How hard could it be?

06:04.906 --> 06:09.160
-Uh, you mean, <i>we </i> can deliver it.
-Bagdwella wanted me to deliver it.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.830
Focus, Jim. We're trying
to win Spring King, remember?

06:11.913 --> 06:14.833
-We can be cool?
-You mean, <i>you </i> want to be cool.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.127
Semantics. You already won
the first challenge.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.547
If you ace this, you'll be a lock
to be king. Then I'll be duke.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.758
Win this and you won't have to worry
about any more of these stupid things.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.093
It's a win-win.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.636
You said we needed to step up.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.805
Guys, troll mail... not what I meant.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.266
-This is our chance to show you.
-[sighs]

06:32.183 --> 06:35.020
Just remember, don't open the box.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.104
Don't worry, dude.

06:36.187 --> 06:40.191
Postmaster Toby and his assistant, Claire,
will handle with care.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.610
[yelps, clears throat]

06:41.693 --> 06:44.237
Oops!
[chuckles]

06:44.321 --> 06:45.322
Whoo! Oh, no.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.575
King and queen nominees,
approach the truck.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.119
-[Steve chuckles]
-Place your hands on the vehicle.

06:51.202 --> 06:56.124
Should you cease contact with it
at any time, you will be eliminated.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.375
[girl]
You've got this, Eli!

06:57.459 --> 07:01.212
Hoo-hoo! I just downed ten energy drinks
and I can go all night.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.340
Aren't you worried
you'll have to use the bathroom?

07:03.423 --> 07:06.635
-Let's just say, I've got it covered.
-Ooh! Are you wearing a diaper?

07:06.718 --> 07:09.471
[cackles]
Who's the loser now, loser?

07:09.554 --> 07:12.349
[grunting]

07:12.432 --> 07:13.350
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:13.433 --> 07:15.977
The Touch-A-Truck-athon begins!

07:17.896 --> 07:19.648
[car horn honking in distance]

07:21.066 --> 07:23.068
-What's up, dude?
-[clears throat]

07:23.151 --> 07:25.820
Okay, so right after fourth period,
we go straight to the post office.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.572
-Got the package?
-In my backpack. Check.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.616
And I have the address.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.786
Che-- Uh-- Oh, no.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.164
-You lost the address?
-What? No! Of course not!

07:36.247 --> 07:38.917
-You don't happen to remember it, do ya?
-Mm!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.962
-It's gotta be here somewhere.
-Look everywhere. I promised Jim!

07:42.045 --> 07:44.798
He gave us the easiest mission
and we already screwed it up?

07:44.881 --> 07:46.299
-[whooshing]
-[gasps]

07:47.175 --> 07:50.845
-Wait, you opened it?
-No. No. [chuckles] Nope. No way.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.307
Define "opened," though.
You told me to look everywhere!

07:54.391 --> 07:58.770
-[grunts] Well, what was in it?
-Nothin'. Just a whoosh.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.690
-What do you mean, "whoosh"?
-The box was totally empty,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.608
but before I could close it,
it was like...

08:03.692 --> 08:06.653
[in slow motion]
whoosh.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.613
That sounds really bad.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.533
-[grunting, bones cracking]
-Toby, are you okay?

08:11.616 --> 08:16.121
Oh, look! The address was
in my back pocket the whole time. Cripes.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.541
Ugh! You are so weird.
I'm holding onto this from now on.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.167
I'll meet you here after class.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.504
[blows raspberry]
Fine!

08:28.216 --> 08:31.177
[sighs]
When do we get a pee break?

08:31.261 --> 08:33.388
That's the point, Miss Wang.
There are none.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.222
Doesn't anyone else have to go?

08:35.306 --> 08:40.270
[chuckling, shivering]
Depends.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.773
-Ew! Gross.
-[laughs] Giving up yet, Lame Junior?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.984
Hand on truck. Not that difficult.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.569
This isn't worth it!

08:47.652 --> 08:49.863
<i>Adiós. </i> You have been eliminated.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.448
[scoffs]
Whatever.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.949
[chuckles]

08:53.908 --> 08:57.162
Mr. Lake, I've been meaning
to speak with you.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.665
I received word
from a mutual acquaintance, Mr. Rot.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.169
He said you had lost something
rather valuable the other day.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.587
I'll get it back.

09:05.670 --> 09:10.008
Sure, you will. Oh, and I'm on my way
to another lunch date with your mother.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.677
It's a shame you won't be able to join us.

09:12.761 --> 09:16.347
You don't happen to have
a breath mint on you, do you?

09:16.431 --> 09:18.558
[laughing]

09:18.641 --> 09:20.143
[continues laughing]

09:22.187 --> 09:23.897

09:23.980 --> 09:26.399
[grunting]

09:26.483 --> 09:27.650
[groaning in slow motion]

09:27.734 --> 09:29.569
-Yeah!
-[gasping]

09:29.652 --> 09:31.780
-[panting]
-[Shannon] I have a breath mint.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.948
[chuckles]

09:34.032 --> 09:37.160
<i>Adiós, </i> Shannon. Darci wins for the girls.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.704
-[chuckles]
-[growls]

09:39.788 --> 09:43.458
What? That's right!
Go, Darci! I'm fabulous!

09:43.541 --> 09:45.210
Of course I am, 'cause I'm Darci!

09:45.293 --> 09:47.462
For the boys, the game is still on.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.422
-[Darci] Go, Darci!
-[Uhl] Congratulations.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.841
-Now, get back to class!
-[Steve] Ha! He's dating your mom?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.718
Whoa! Why didn't I think of that?

09:53.802 --> 09:57.931
So, if A is 30 degrees
and B is 40 degrees,

09:58.014 --> 09:59.766
what solves for C?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.394
No, no. Oh, no. No, no, no.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.772
Mr. Domzalski, is there a problem?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.316
No, just loving triangles.

10:08.399 --> 10:11.569
Then perhaps you can come up
to the board and solve this one.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.656
-I respectfully decline.
-[all laughing]

10:14.739 --> 10:18.910
-The whoosh.
-Mr. Domzalski, it is not a request.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.663
Come to the board right now!

10:21.746 --> 10:23.039
-[snickering]

10:38.680 --> 10:39.681
[boy]
Weirdo.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.891
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Domzalski?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.893
Uh... bathroom?

10:43.977 --> 10:47.397
"Oh, yes, we'll deliver the package.
We'll deliver the package."

10:47.480 --> 10:48.731
What a dumb idea!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.317
Ah!
[grunts]

10:51.401 --> 10:54.070
Move it, Dumb-zalski!
[laughs]

10:54.154 --> 10:55.572
[gasps]

10:55.655 --> 10:57.365
No, no, no, no, no!

10:57.448 --> 11:00.410
[screaming, whimpering]

11:00.493 --> 11:02.745
No, no, no, no, no!

11:02.829 --> 11:05.081
[grunting, screaming]

11:05.165 --> 11:09.919
"The human skeleton completely regenerates
every seven years."

11:10.003 --> 11:11.462
Whoa, is that true? That's crazy!

11:11.546 --> 11:13.548
I'll tell you what,
my spine does not regenerate...

11:13.631 --> 11:14.799
[whispering]
Claire!

11:14.883 --> 11:18.887
Coach Lawrence, um, I need
the hall pass. Girl problems.

11:22.473 --> 11:26.519
Claire! Help! Help!

11:26.603 --> 11:30.064
-Toby! What are you doing up there?
-I've never loved my school so much!

11:30.148 --> 11:31.983
[Steve beatboxing]

11:32.066 --> 11:34.027
Quick, quick! Get me down, get me down!

11:34.110 --> 11:37.447
-Ugh.
-[continues beatboxing]

11:37.530 --> 11:42.160
Still not giving up, and your breath
smells worse than your diaper.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.332
It was the whoosh, wasn't it?

11:47.415 --> 11:50.460
Oh, this is all your fault! You were
the one who wanted to deliver it!

11:50.543 --> 11:51.836
But you volunteered with me.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.755
Because you were gonna take all the glory!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.882
We can't tell Jim.
Promise me, you won't tell Jim.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.133
He already thinks I'm useless.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.052
Toby, look at us.

11:59.135 --> 12:02.305
-We are useless. Ugh!
-Let me think, let me think, let me think.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.223
[gasps]
Maybe Blinky will know how to fix this!

12:04.307 --> 12:06.017
Blinky? He's at Jim's house.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.562
Well, then let's go!
No, no, no, no, no! Grab me!

12:09.646 --> 12:10.855
[panting]

12:10.939 --> 12:14.484
Yeah, he's been talking to the new
guidance counselor about his father--

12:14.567 --> 12:15.652
Guidance counselor?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.947
Yes, the one you recently
brought in. Mr. Blinky?

12:19.030 --> 12:21.115
-[retches, coughs]
-Are you okay?

12:21.199 --> 12:24.619
[coughing]

12:24.702 --> 12:26.955
Mr. Blinky?
[clears throat]

12:27.038 --> 12:31.250
I'm sorry. Here I am on a date,
going on about Jim's father.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.795
I really don't know
how to do these things.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.216
You're doing just fine.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.428
-[Toby screaming in distance]
-[panting]

12:43.054 --> 12:48.434
Uh! Hey, grab me! Grab me!
Don't lose me like you lost the stone!

12:48.518 --> 12:50.144
I'm trying! And shut up!

12:50.228 --> 12:54.565
-[grunts]
-Aw, come on, Claire! No, no, no, no!

12:55.358 --> 12:58.653
Whoa! Wait a sec!
Hey, I think-- I think it's wearing off!

12:58.736 --> 13:00.738
Nice! It just wore off.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.865
[sighs]
Uh-oh.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.159
[in slow motion]
Oh, no!

13:05.827 --> 13:08.079
-What's happening to me?
-[panting]

13:08.162 --> 13:12.083
-Toby, what's wrong?
-[sobbing] Can't move.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.127
[grunting]

13:14.210 --> 13:15.795
The whoosh! It's making you switch

13:15.878 --> 13:19.173
between super light and super heavy
without warning!

13:19.257 --> 13:21.384
That seems accurate.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.556
[grunting]

13:26.639 --> 13:29.851
Toby, no offense,
but you got a real weight problem.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.436
-Not funny.
-[siren beeping]

13:31.519 --> 13:33.688
Oh, no! It's the po-po!

13:33.771 --> 13:34.689
-[car door closing]
-Huh?

13:34.772 --> 13:38.776
Hey, cool kids, what you doing there?
Skipping school?

13:38.860 --> 13:39.861
Oh, hello, officer.

13:39.944 --> 13:44.323
I'm just taking my brother, um,
to his appointment at the hospital.

13:44.407 --> 13:48.286
-He, uh, has a rare condition.
-Yes. I have no bones.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.704
What? Seriously?

13:49.787 --> 13:52.540
Extremely rare.
Someone stole his wheelchair.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.001
Ugh, poor kid. No bones?

13:55.084 --> 13:58.004
I can't let you go like this.
Let me call a squad car.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.382
That's very kind of you, sir,
but, uh, he likes the fresh air.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.219
No, I insist.
Hey, uh, I got a kid here, real hero.

14:05.303 --> 14:09.640
Needs a lift.
Probably one of the larger cars. Over.

14:09.724 --> 14:10.725
-Wait. What?
-[woman] <i>Confirmation.</i>

14:10.808 --> 14:12.935
<i>ETA, seven minutes.</i>
<i>How big of a car?</i>

14:13.019 --> 14:16.481
Something real funny
goin' on around here.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.234
[gasps]
Mm...

14:21.277 --> 14:25.823
Hour four is complete.
I need more coffee. Eli is in charge.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.158
Hooray!

14:27.241 --> 14:28.576
-[laughs]
-Oh!

14:28.659 --> 14:31.788
-Ow! Seriously?
-My hand hasn't left the truck.

14:31.871 --> 14:32.789
[grunts]

14:32.872 --> 14:35.666
Guys, please stop!
I don't want to get in trouble!

14:40.129 --> 14:43.174
-[whimpers]
-Quit it! Don't make me-- [grunts]

14:43.257 --> 14:44.509
[both grunting]

14:45.468 --> 14:48.096
Let go, dweeb!
[grunts]

14:48.179 --> 14:51.182
-Get off of me!
-Stop! Please!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.850
[whimpering]

14:53.559 --> 14:55.228
This isn't happening!

14:57.772 --> 14:59.524
-[phone vibrating]
-[gasps]

14:59.607 --> 15:01.818
-Claire, it's you!
<i>-Toby, you drifted away!</i>

15:01.901 --> 15:04.070
<i>-Where the heck are you?</i>
-I'm right above the--

15:04.153 --> 15:06.906
-No, no, no, no, no! Aw, come on!
-[phone shatters]

15:06.989 --> 15:09.033
[gasps]
Is that Claire's house?

15:09.117 --> 15:11.202
[grunting]

15:11.285 --> 15:14.038
Notenrique! Notenrique!

15:14.122 --> 15:19.377
What the--? Hey, Tons-of-Fun!
What you doin' all the way up there?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.629
[grunting]
Quick! Do something!

15:21.712 --> 15:24.590
-Hold on a sec!
-Notenrique!

15:24.674 --> 15:26.843
-This is priceless!
-[camera clicks]

15:26.926 --> 15:30.430
-Whoa! [laughs]
-That's what you did? You took a selfie?

15:30.513 --> 15:32.473
Send you a copy!

15:32.557 --> 15:37.478
This is it. This is how I go out.
I had so much left to do.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.189
So many taco trucks I never ate at.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.441
[sobbing]

15:41.524 --> 15:43.734
-[grunting]
-[Claire] Grab it already!

15:43.818 --> 15:47.238
[gasps] You found me! What the heck?
Reel me in, reel me in!

15:47.321 --> 15:48.448
-Say it.
-Say what?

15:48.531 --> 15:51.826
I'm not bringing you down until you admit
you've been a butt to me all day.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.744
You're jealous of me being close to Jim!

15:53.828 --> 15:57.665
Claire! I'm sorry, okay? Come on!

15:57.748 --> 15:59.792
Admit it! You've been a total butt!

15:59.876 --> 16:01.586
[grunts]

16:01.669 --> 16:04.297
Okay, you're right, I am a butt.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.092
[sighs] It's just-- for so long,
it was the Jim and Toby show, you know?

16:08.176 --> 16:10.178
And you're this cool, smart girl,

16:10.261 --> 16:12.221
who's great at everything
and is really pretty,

16:12.305 --> 16:15.600
and now you have this super rad
shadow staff, and what do I have?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.310
I've got weight problems.

16:17.393 --> 16:21.105
Toby, you and Jim are the dynamic duo.
I can never change that.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.900
Hoo! I was so afraid
you were gonna be mad at me,

16:23.983 --> 16:25.359
and we were never gonna be friends again,

16:25.443 --> 16:27.862
and it was just all these bad things
I didn't want to think about.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.865
-Toby, I think the curse is spreading.
-Oh, no! What do we do? What do we do?

16:30.948 --> 16:33.367
Let's just get to Jim's house.
Blinky will know what to do.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.119
[both grunting]

16:35.203 --> 16:38.289
-Hand's still on the truck! [laughs]
-Guys, please stop!

16:38.372 --> 16:39.707
[all grunting]

16:39.790 --> 16:43.252
Eli's gone. Looks like it's just
you and me now, buttsnack!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.754
-Whoa!
-[laughs]

16:46.380 --> 16:49.217
-[horn honking]
-[Steve whooping, laughing]

16:49.300 --> 16:51.093
I really do not like the decaf.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.262
[man] Guys, guys!
There's a fight outside! Come on!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.515
-What in the heck is going on?
-Kids today.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.603
-Steve, stop this!
-Why couldn't you let me win this?

17:00.686 --> 17:03.523
-But then you never do, do you?
-What are you talking about?

17:03.606 --> 17:07.527
People respected me. And you broke
my face in front of everyone.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.779
I got benched from the team and the play.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.449
And now you got Claire. I liked my life.

17:13.532 --> 17:17.286
You've threatened everything I know,
turned my world upside down.

17:17.369 --> 17:21.332
And you know what the worst part is?
I... I'm intimidated by you, Jim.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.876
What? Steve, I don't know
what to say, man.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.295
-I didn't know. I do care.
-Yeah, right.

17:26.378 --> 17:30.675
[sighs] You know what?
Here. Look. You win.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.178
[cackles]

17:34.262 --> 17:36.556
I can't believe you fell for it!

17:36.639 --> 17:39.058
[cackling]
Whoo!

17:39.141 --> 17:40.810
[continues cackling]

17:40.893 --> 17:44.814
-Steve, are you nuts?
-Who's the loser now, loser?

17:44.897 --> 17:48.317
Ka-boom!
[laughs]

17:48.401 --> 17:50.486
What happened here?
I heard there was a fight. Are you okay?

17:50.570 --> 17:52.071
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank heavens!

17:52.154 --> 17:56.492
My sweet Susanna is unharmed.
<i>Du bist mein Schnuckiputzi.</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:01.747
[clears throat]
It seems we have a winner.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.793
Whoo! That's right! Who wins? I do!

18:05.876 --> 18:08.546
-Look at me! I--
-[coughs, grunts]

18:08.629 --> 18:11.924
Ha! Eli is the champion
of the Touch-A-Truck-athon.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.175
-What? No!
-What? Yay!

18:13.259 --> 18:17.388
No! No, no, no, no, no!

18:17.763 --> 18:19.432
[grunting]

18:19.515 --> 18:22.560
She nearly took my head off
with the shadow staff.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.604
The chubby one's just as bad.

18:24.687 --> 18:26.981
They're just human whelps after all.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.108
Hopefully, they'll get their acts
together soon enough.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.902
-[Toby] Blinky, you gotta help us!
-[gasps]

18:31.986 --> 18:33.195
[gasps]

18:33.279 --> 18:36.073
[whimpering]

18:36.157 --> 18:38.409
[whimpering, grunting]

18:38.492 --> 18:39.577
What in blue blazes?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.829
Toby opened Bagdwella's box.
Now we're floating and sinking.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.623
And it's getting worse! What's happening?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.584
Whoa! Oh, dear.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.378
[Toby screaming]

18:49.462 --> 18:51.839
[screaming]

18:51.922 --> 18:54.008
-My, my, my!
-[whimpering]

18:54.091 --> 18:55.885
[grunting]

18:55.968 --> 18:59.722
A curse box! Why would you be
in possession of such a dangerous gift?

18:59.805 --> 19:02.433
[grunts] We were trying to help Jim,
but, please, can you turn it off?

19:02.516 --> 19:04.810
-Ooh, a Nougat Nummy!
-A curse cannot be broken.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.855
It can only be passed on,
or it will grow stronger by the minute.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.899
-[grunts]
-Vendel. Vendel-- [grunts]

19:09.982 --> 19:12.652
Vendel can contain the curse.
We must get to Vendel.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.655
-But how? We'll never get to Trollmarket.
-[loud rumbling]

19:17.073 --> 19:19.158
Oh, no! The curse
is spreading to the house!

19:19.241 --> 19:22.787
-We must get to Vendel!
-What foolishness is this?

19:22.870 --> 19:23.829
[grunts]

19:23.913 --> 19:25.539
[gasps]

19:25.623 --> 19:28.918
Claire, use your shadow staff!
You can get us to Vendel!

19:29.001 --> 19:30.670
But I can't!

19:30.753 --> 19:34.465
I can only open a portal that's big enough
for a baby mouse or an olive, remember?

19:34.548 --> 19:38.636
You must think of Vendel. Clear your mind.
Think of nothing but him!

19:40.554 --> 19:44.600
-I can't!
-Okay, I hate to do this. Um...

19:44.684 --> 19:49.647
Hey, Claire! Don't let us down,
like you did with the Killstone, remember?

19:49.730 --> 19:52.149
-You lost it!
-What?

19:52.233 --> 19:56.195
You know, I don't think you're ready
to be a Trollhunter. I really don't.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.579
You see that shadow staff?
You're not worthy to wield its powers.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.081
Am I right, Blinky?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.375
Um... indeed! Yes!

20:09.458 --> 20:11.627
I saved you!
I thought we were friends now.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.214
Friends don't let friends down,
like you did with the Killstone!

20:15.297 --> 20:17.049
Why are you being such a butt again?

20:17.133 --> 20:20.344
Oh, are you angry, Claire?
Are you mad? Are you mad enough?

20:20.428 --> 20:21.512
Yeah! I'm angry!

20:21.595 --> 20:24.932
Then look at the staff
and think of Vendel and make a portal!

20:25.015 --> 20:26.100
Thank you!

20:26.183 --> 20:28.519
[grunting]

20:34.108 --> 20:34.942
Hmm...

20:35.901 --> 20:36.736
Mm...

20:38.237 --> 20:41.115
-What in Deya's Grace?
-Vendel! Pull us through!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.119
[all screaming]

20:47.788 --> 20:49.039
[all grunting]

20:49.123 --> 20:52.626
-Watch out!
-[screams, grunts]

20:52.710 --> 20:56.297
-[sighs]
-I did it? I did it!

20:56.380 --> 20:58.466
What did you do now, Blinkous?

20:58.549 --> 21:00.718
Don't look down at me.
It's Tobias who is cursed.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.429
I'll apologize a million times later,
but can you stop this?

21:03.512 --> 21:05.973
Of course, but I need a vessel
to trap the curse.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.476
Quick! Get something! Anything!

21:08.559 --> 21:12.480
Wait, not anything! I know just the thing.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.943
Awesome sauce!

21:18.027 --> 21:19.862
[screams, grunts]

21:19.945 --> 21:23.783
Now, we both have sweet weapons.
I was born to wield the warhammer.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.242
-[chuckles, screams]
-[grunts]

21:25.785 --> 21:28.537
-The curse appears to be stable.
-Sort of.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.914
[grunting]

21:29.997 --> 21:30.956
[Claire laughs]

21:31.040 --> 21:33.834
They look pretty good.
Any problems mailing the package?

21:33.918 --> 21:37.505
-Actually, Master Jim--
-Your team did an excellent job.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.465
Your allies are getting stronger.

21:39.548 --> 21:45.179
In time, a lot of time,
they may actually be... useful.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.848
[screaming]

21:47.932 --> 21:48.766
Whoa!

21:48.849 --> 21:51.227
"Useful." It's a start.
You got room for one more?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.897
Since when could you do that
with a hammer, Tobes?

21:54.980 --> 21:58.108
Yah! Hello? It's a warhammer.
Respect it, please.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.944
-Be quick on your feet! Hi-yah!
-Whoo!
