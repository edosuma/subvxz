WEBVTT

00:13.112 --> 00:14.704
Pika!

00:21.454 --> 00:22.648
Narrator: The pokéball.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.121
An invention that's captured

00:24.224 --> 00:26.624
the imagination
of people everywhere,

00:26.726 --> 00:27.920
thanks to its ability

00:28.027 --> 00:30.461
to capture the most marvelous
of creatures.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.861
Pokémon.

00:31.965 --> 00:35.128
And to catch one is
an experience like none other.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.260
Each of these
spectacular species

00:37.337 --> 00:39.134
has amazing powers
and attributes

00:39.239 --> 00:41.036
that set them apart
from one another

00:41.074 --> 00:43.668
in ways too numerous to list.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.938
But unique as they are
individually,

00:45.979 --> 00:50.348
together they make up the
incredible world of pokémon.

01:24.117 --> 01:28.019
Golem.

01:28.655 --> 01:29.622
Geo.

01:29.656 --> 01:30.714
- Geodude.
- Geodude.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.748
- Geo.
- Geodude.

01:32.825 --> 01:33.825
Haunter.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.760
Haunter. Haunter.

01:44.837 --> 01:46.327
Primeape!

01:55.848 --> 01:57.475
- Pelipper!
- Wingull!

01:57.550 --> 01:59.245
- Pelipper!
- Wingull!

02:11.431 --> 02:13.228
Sharpedo.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.029
Pokémon
and people like ash ketchum

02:16.135 --> 02:17.625
can come together as a team.

02:17.737 --> 02:20.228
For once they're captured
in a pokéball,

02:20.306 --> 02:22.331
pokémon bond
with their human trainers

02:22.442 --> 02:25.138
as friends, partners, family.

02:25.211 --> 02:28.738
On their journey of discovery,
trainers and their pokémon

02:28.815 --> 02:32.148
learn as much about themselves
as each other.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.310
And they also realize

02:33.419 --> 02:35.319
that there will always be
more pokémon

02:35.355 --> 02:37.118
than they could ever
have imagined.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.453
You see, for each pokémon
that's discovered,

02:39.525 --> 02:41.652
there are dozens,
perhaps hundreds, more

02:41.761 --> 02:43.422
we have yet to meet.

02:43.463 --> 02:44.828
One thing's for sure.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.958
With each of these new pokémon
come new possibilities,

02:48.067 --> 02:52.527
new stories, new friendships,
and new adventures.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.219
Perhaps pokémon trainers

03:16.329 --> 03:19.230
aren't the only ones to
seek out new species.

03:19.298 --> 03:22.495
The pokémon themselves seem to
have an innate curiosity

03:22.602 --> 03:26.129
for the creatures of this world
and of worlds beyond.

03:26.239 --> 03:29.504
After all, we may live
on a pokémon planet,

03:29.609 --> 03:33.340
but nobody ever said
that it's the only one.

05:00.199 --> 05:03.168
Professor, have you seen Tory?

05:03.469 --> 05:04.868
Take a look.

05:07.874 --> 05:11.071
Uh-huh.
Impossible keeping up with him.

05:18.784 --> 05:20.581
Spheal!

05:20.686 --> 05:22.620
Wow, it's a spheal.

05:22.688 --> 05:24.280
Spheal, spheal!

05:24.323 --> 05:25.881
Hi.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.290
Spheal, spheal. Spheal!

05:28.394 --> 05:29.394
Spheal!

05:30.329 --> 05:34.789
Spheal! Spheal! Spheal, spheal!

05:39.038 --> 05:40.903
Ah!

06:20.880 --> 06:22.575
Whoa!

06:31.424 --> 06:33.688
Whoa!

06:36.696 --> 06:38.288
Aah!

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
Aah!

06:46.906 --> 06:48.703
Tory!

06:52.211 --> 06:53.235
Oh!

06:53.312 --> 06:55.803
You're okay. I've got you.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.716
Thank you, daddy.

07:35.287 --> 07:38.313
It's some kind of pokémon,
isn't it?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.325
Yes.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.294
It's a pokémon from outer space.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.878
Rayquaza never leaves
the ozone layer.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.573
Why now?

08:44.457 --> 08:46.084
It regenerated.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.820
But how's that possible?

08:57.036 --> 08:58.799
Let's go. It's too dangerous.

08:58.904 --> 09:00.030
Yeah.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.404
Are you okay?

10:02.434 --> 10:03.628
Quick. Follow me.

10:03.702 --> 10:05.294
I'm right behind you.

10:25.457 --> 10:27.015
Whoa!

10:44.343 --> 10:45.674
Spheal, spheal, spheal!

10:45.744 --> 10:47.541
Spheal! Spheal!

10:59.491 --> 11:00.890
Oh, what is it?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.290
Look at that.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.004
Rayquaza is furious.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.641
Another pokémon
crossing into its territory

12:23.709 --> 12:26.007
has obviously threatened it.

12:38.324 --> 12:43.318
4 years later...

12:49.368 --> 12:51.165
Huh?

12:56.742 --> 12:58.835
Fire the laser.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.681
Raise our trajectory by.5.

13:13.792 --> 13:14.986
Right.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.491
That's the frequency.

13:23.535 --> 13:25.002
Finally. In sync.

13:25.104 --> 13:26.628
- That means...
- Yes.

13:26.705 --> 13:30.607
The crystal should regenerate
if we keep the laser on target.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.608
We will succeed.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.510
We have to.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.571
We overloaded the regulator.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.179
It was just one small component
that malfunctioned.

14:14.219 --> 14:15.584
A simple replacement.

14:15.687 --> 14:16.585
Good.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.679
We'll try again
after it's fixed.

14:18.791 --> 14:19.791
Yes, sir.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.486
Huh?

14:23.896 --> 14:24.896
Guess what.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.228
I'm gonna tell you
about this book I'm reading.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.299
It's so good.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.494
Once that part's replaced,
we're almost home.

14:30.602 --> 14:32.194
Yeah, we're so close.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.703
Huh?

14:39.344 --> 14:40.344
I was right.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.209
I did see it glow.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.684
Wow!

15:35.601 --> 15:38.126
On his journey to become
a pokémon master,

15:38.203 --> 15:41.001
ash ketchum and his friends
arrive in larousse city,

15:41.039 --> 15:44.338
the headquarters for anything
and everything high-tech.

15:44.409 --> 15:47.003
But he's not here
for the gadgets and gizmos.

15:47.045 --> 15:52.210
Ash is itching for action at
the town's famous battle tower.

15:52.317 --> 15:54.615
- Pelipper!
- Pelipper!

16:30.923 --> 16:33.084
Yay!

16:35.794 --> 16:37.489
Yay!

16:43.402 --> 16:44.334
Munch.

16:44.403 --> 16:47.338
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.685
Munch?

17:05.790 --> 17:07.952
Munch.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.354
Munch.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.156
Munch?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.194
Munch.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.502
Munch!

17:37.589 --> 17:39.181
Munch.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.885
Munch.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.722
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

17:50.602 --> 17:51.534
Welcome.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.594
You are now in larousse city.

17:53.705 --> 17:54.729
Welcome again.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.705
- Cool.
- It's so cute.

17:56.775 --> 17:57.935
A robot.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.274
What could be better than that?

18:00.345 --> 18:02.472
Being greeted by a real live
beautiful girl

18:02.547 --> 18:04.344
could be one thing.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.281
Smile!

18:14.860 --> 18:16.987
Computer:
Visitor data confirmed.

18:17.095 --> 18:20.189
Citizenship
and point of origin recorded.

18:20.299 --> 18:23.462
These will serve
as your passports.

18:24.202 --> 18:25.396
Our passports?

18:25.470 --> 18:28.769
While in larousse city,
keep them with you at all times.

18:28.807 --> 18:32.573
Your passports can be used
for shopping and other needs.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.276
Don't think I'll be sending
this one home.

18:39.384 --> 18:43.184
So, I wonder which way to go
for the battle tower?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.778
Aah!

18:44.823 --> 18:46.882
Help!

18:49.127 --> 18:51.618
Hey, ash, quit messing around.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.129
A moving sidewalk.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.595
Dude, you're swimming upstream.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.139
There is an easier way.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.835
If t ever get off of this thing,
maybe you could show it to me.

19:05.944 --> 19:06.968
Aah!

19:07.045 --> 19:08.045
Nice fall.

19:08.447 --> 19:09.937
Together: Nice fall.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.243
Blaze.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.049
Help him out, blaziken, okay?

19:17.089 --> 19:20.081
Blaze.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.489
Oh!

19:27.399 --> 19:28.798
- Hey, thanks a lot.
- Pikachu.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.098
Sure. No need to thank me.

19:31.203 --> 19:34.195
It just couldn't continue
watching you look like a fool.

19:34.272 --> 19:36.069
What? Aah!

19:36.174 --> 19:38.768
So I guess you're all
new in town, huh?

19:38.877 --> 19:42.574
If you're heading for the battle
tower, you should go this way.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.875
Be careful.

19:43.915 --> 19:45.678
Don't fall.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.911
My name's ash from palette town.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.715
How'd you like to battle
with me?

19:49.788 --> 19:52.222
Watch out.
My brother rafe's really strong.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.518
Blaziken too.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.592
Blaze.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.991
Yeah, I'd love to have
a battle with you, ash.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.292
Let's get together
at the battle tower.

19:59.331 --> 20:02.630
So we're finally gonna settle
this today, right, rafe?

20:02.734 --> 20:04.793
Hello, my bespectacled beauty.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.530
- I'm Brock.
- Stop!

20:07.739 --> 20:11.436
You could say your friend here
has really fallen for Rebecca.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.102
She's a good metagross trainer.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.908
Likes to use her laptop
for strategy.

20:14.946 --> 20:16.641
So, my name is sid.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.512
Blastoise is my partner.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.915
Hi. I'm may.

20:19.951 --> 20:22.613
And this is my brother, Max.

20:23.054 --> 20:24.646
Hey. You're kinda cute.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.213
Kinda?

20:27.125 --> 20:28.922
And kinda crazy, too.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.562
Look. The battle tower.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.365
Look, pikachu. It's right there.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.332
Oh, I can't wait!

20:37.436 --> 20:39.529
Pika!

20:43.341 --> 20:45.673
T'll be back
as soon as I'm registered.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.735
Okay.
Then we'll head to the stands.

20:47.779 --> 20:49.269
See you.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.973
There. Let's hurry.

20:55.687 --> 20:56.687
Oh!

21:00.392 --> 21:02.883
Hmm. Uh-oh.

21:02.994 --> 21:04.791
Now where are we?

21:07.933 --> 21:08.831
Oh, wow.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.799
There's a library, too.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.696
Oh!

21:17.709 --> 21:18.641
Excuse me.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.836
- Huh?
- Pika!

21:19.911 --> 21:21.538
Aah!

21:21.613 --> 21:24.013
Hold on.
What are you running away for?

21:24.115 --> 21:25.207
Pika?

21:25.317 --> 21:26.215
Wait.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.343
Hold up.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.113
Hi. Let me start that again.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.624
We're on our way to a battle,

21:34.659 --> 21:36.718
but we don't know
how to get there.

21:36.761 --> 21:37.921
We're kinda lost.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.123
Pika, pika!

21:41.366 --> 21:42.366
Aah!

21:42.434 --> 21:44.834
Wait. We just want to... hi.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.667
Are you ready for your battle?

21:46.738 --> 21:49.263
Right this way, gentlemen.

21:49.341 --> 21:50.831
But you don't understand.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.376
If you hurry up,
you two might just make it.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.242
But I haven't registered yet.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.475
That will all happen
automatically.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.847
Now, good luck, you two.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.815
Computer: Passports confirmed.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.518
Two youth-level participants
entered successfully.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.526
Great. And just in time.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.186
Pika!

22:12.631 --> 22:15.896
Entry for participants
in the first round is closed.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.730
Please try again next time.

22:17.802 --> 22:18.826
What?

22:18.937 --> 22:20.336
Hmm.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.306
Computer:
Now introducing our first entry.

22:26.811 --> 22:28.244
Pika.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.010
Here we go.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.916
Pikachu!

22:38.256 --> 22:39.416
Qur first match

22:39.457 --> 22:42.358
will be an official
battle tower tag-team event.

22:42.460 --> 22:44.519
Remember to cheer
for your favorites.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.961
Tag-team, huh? Yeah!

22:47.065 --> 22:49.260
We have ash ketchum
in the blue corner,

22:49.334 --> 22:51.768
a trainer all the way
from palette town.

22:51.836 --> 22:54.669
And his tag partner,
Tory, a local trainer.

22:54.739 --> 22:56.468
All right, Tory. Good luck.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.840
I wonder how ash
got entered so quickly.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.776
By cutting in front of me.

23:01.813 --> 23:04.782
Rebecca, there comes a time
in a man's life

23:04.816 --> 23:07.580
when he's presented with
the gift of love at first sight.

23:07.619 --> 23:10.087
How about pain at first pull?

23:10.121 --> 23:11.816
Not the ear.

23:13.024 --> 23:16.790
Professor lund,
take a look at this.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.922
Tory? In a pokémon battle?

23:20.799 --> 23:24.291
And in the red corner, we have
two trainers from south city.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.131
Rafe and sid.

23:26.204 --> 23:29.503
Hey, ash, you sure didn't waste
any time.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.304
Of course not.
I couldn't wait to beat you.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.106
Hey, may!

23:35.213 --> 23:36.407
Make sure you watch.

23:36.514 --> 23:38.744
I'm dedicating this battle
to you.

23:41.720 --> 23:44.712
The basic rule in all tag-team
battles is teamwork.

23:44.823 --> 23:46.916
Each trainer
uses a single pokémon

23:47.025 --> 23:48.515
and works with his teammate.

23:48.627 --> 23:52.620
And now, trainers,
bring out your pokémon.

23:52.664 --> 23:55.531
All right. Here goes.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.036
Blaze!

23:59.137 --> 24:00.399
Blastoise!

24:00.472 --> 24:02.372
Pikachu, I choose you.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.669
Pika. Pikachu!

24:04.776 --> 24:06.903
Tory, what pokémon
are you gonna use?

24:06.978 --> 24:09.811
No, ash,
I don't have any pokémon.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.610
There seems to be a problem.

24:11.683 --> 24:14.277
We've seen only one pokémon
from the blue corner.

24:14.319 --> 24:16.184
See, I was trying to tell you.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.620
I'm not a trainer.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.281
I can't battle.

24:19.324 --> 24:22.316
But this could end up being
my only chance to battle rafe.

24:22.394 --> 24:23.588
Hey, I know what.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.391
I'll loan you one of my pokémon.

24:25.430 --> 24:26.590
What do you say?

24:26.698 --> 24:27.892
Come on, that'll work.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.694
But...

24:29.801 --> 24:31.632
Will the blue corner forfeit?

24:31.703 --> 24:34.331
Don't let me down, Tory.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.397
Well, if I have to.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.443
Torkoal!

24:41.513 --> 24:44.311
So, looks like we have
our pokémon.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.748
Ready for a battle?
'Cause here we go.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.750
Let's do it.

24:47.819 --> 24:49.912
Blaziken, use Blaze kick now.

24:49.954 --> 24:53.720
Blaziken!

24:53.825 --> 24:55.656
Dodge, pikachu.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.162
Go blastoise, hydro pump.

25:00.198 --> 25:02.393
Blastoise!

25:02.467 --> 25:03.297
Pika!

25:03.401 --> 25:06.268
It's a dazzling combination
from the red corner.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.896
Blastoise, bubble attack.

25:07.972 --> 25:10.167
Blastoise!

25:11.676 --> 25:15.009
Torkoal! Tory, you have to tell
torkoal to do something.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.014
But I don't know
what to tell it.

25:17.082 --> 25:18.572
Blastoise rapid spin.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.674
Blastoise!

25:20.719 --> 25:23.586
Blastoise!

25:26.224 --> 25:29.091
Torkoal!

25:29.928 --> 25:32.488
Blast!

25:38.436 --> 25:39.596
Ugh!

25:43.808 --> 25:45.901
Blastoise!

25:46.010 --> 25:46.908
Torkoal.

25:47.011 --> 25:49.002
Blastoise!

25:49.047 --> 25:50.810
Pikachu, use thunderbolt.

25:50.849 --> 25:51.907
Cover torkoal.

25:51.950 --> 25:54.510
Pikachu!

25:54.552 --> 25:56.611
Blastoise!

25:56.654 --> 25:59.020
Blaziken!

25:59.057 --> 26:00.854
Blastoise, skull bash! Go!

26:00.959 --> 26:02.256
Blastoise!

26:02.360 --> 26:04.851
Torkoal.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.557
Looks like the blue corner

26:06.664 --> 26:09.189
just can't seem to get it
together as a team.

26:09.300 --> 26:12.758
Man, ash's partner isn't doing
anything to help him out at all.

26:12.871 --> 26:14.998
I don't see how he could win.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.871
Come on! Do something!

26:18.376 --> 26:19.376
Tory, don't worry.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.707
I'll take care of it.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.576
Flamethrower, torkoal. Go!

26:22.680 --> 26:23.977
Torkoal.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.414
Torkoal!

26:25.483 --> 26:26.780
Pika!

26:26.818 --> 26:31.380
Whoa! A flamethrower from
torkoal, but it hit pikachu.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.421
Oh!

26:33.491 --> 26:34.685
How embarrassing.

26:34.726 --> 26:37.320
So, rafe, want to finish
this one up?

26:37.428 --> 26:38.520
Let's go.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.188
Blaziken, overheat.

26:40.298 --> 26:42.493
Blaziken!

26:43.902 --> 26:45.529
Pika!

26:45.603 --> 26:46.797
Torkoal.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.429
Pikachu. Torkoal.

26:48.540 --> 26:49.802
Announcer: And that's it.

26:49.908 --> 26:52.536
Pikachu and torkoal
are unable to battle.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.510
Rafe and sid are the winners.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.606
Congratulations.

26:58.449 --> 27:01.577
- Blaze!
- Blastoise!

27:09.994 --> 27:12.155
- Tory.
- Daddy.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.060
We just watched
your pokémon battle.

27:14.098 --> 27:15.656
I'm incredibly proud.

27:15.767 --> 27:16.699
Don't be.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.167
It was all an accident.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.763
Wasn't even supposed to happen.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.181
Yuko, meeting you reminds me
of a time in my life

27:32.283 --> 27:33.875
when I, too, spent long hours

27:33.985 --> 27:35.816
toiling
as a professor's assistant.

27:35.887 --> 27:39.880
I'm sure professor Ivy would be
happy to vouch for my work.

27:39.924 --> 27:43.485
And I'll be happy to vouch
for his insanity.

27:43.928 --> 27:46.692
We apologize for the mix-up
with your battle.

27:46.731 --> 27:50.497
The truth is, Tory is completely
afraid of pokémon.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.627
How could he be afraid
of pokémon?

27:52.737 --> 27:57.140
Well, about four years ago, he
had a very traumatic experience,

27:57.208 --> 27:59.733
and it left him terrified
of them.

27:59.811 --> 28:04.145
Sadly, he still hasn't managed
to get over those fears.

28:18.963 --> 28:21.454
Aah! Shoo! Shoo!

28:35.179 --> 28:37.977
Wow. I shouldn't
have pushed him so hard.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.985
But underneath it all,
I think he loves them.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.817
All he really needs is
the chance to get to know them.

28:43.888 --> 28:44.980
That's all.

28:45.089 --> 28:47.182
I'm sure that's all it'll take.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.285
Fine.
Then I'll give him that chance.

28:50.328 --> 28:53.525
All he needs now is to become
friends with me and pikachu.

28:53.631 --> 28:54.689
Right, pal?

28:54.799 --> 28:55.731
Pika.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.700
Yay! I want to help, too.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.326
- Sodol.
- Me too.

28:59.437 --> 29:00.631
Cool. So what do you say

29:00.738 --> 29:02.365
we all go and look
for Tory, okay?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.372
All: Yeah!

29:03.441 --> 29:04.965
You're awfully kind.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.270
Thank you.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.054
Tory?

29:19.090 --> 29:20.455
Pika?

29:35.773 --> 29:37.764
Aah!

29:39.610 --> 29:40.804
Later!

29:52.290 --> 29:55.020
Munch.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.492
Munch.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.135
Munch! Munch!

30:11.609 --> 30:13.804
Munch.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.513
Munch!

30:29.427 --> 30:30.519
Huh?

30:34.165 --> 30:36.360
Hey! Come on out!

30:36.434 --> 30:37.924
Where are you?

30:37.969 --> 30:40.563
I want to tell you
something important.

30:54.752 --> 30:56.447
You'll never guess
what I just did.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.182
I helped out a pokémon.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.588
It had its head stuck
inside a garbage can.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.092
I helped to get it out.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.127
Isn't that cool?

31:52.743 --> 31:55.940
Hey. What are those lights?

31:56.047 --> 31:58.982
And I was even part
of a pokémon battle, too.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.985
Of course, I wasn't very good,
so that part kinda stunk.

32:02.019 --> 32:04.920
Ash: Hey.
Who are you talking to?

32:05.389 --> 32:06.822
Pika?

32:17.935 --> 32:20.335
Hey, it's gone.

32:22.406 --> 32:24.306
Come on, who was it?

32:24.408 --> 32:25.807
None of your business.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.309
What? Would it hurt to tell me?

32:27.345 --> 32:31.111
Stop. Leave me alone, okay?

32:31.149 --> 32:32.149
Wait a minute.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.012
If this town is so high-tech,

32:34.051 --> 32:35.951
why don't they have
moving sidewalks?

32:36.020 --> 32:38.113
Or robots that serve hamburgers?

32:38.156 --> 32:40.056
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

32:43.961 --> 32:45.724
I'll take a hamburger, please.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.663
Computer: Hamburger.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.370
Yum!

32:56.941 --> 32:58.875
Together: Hamburgers, please.

32:58.976 --> 33:01.069
Passport. Passport. Passport.

33:01.179 --> 33:02.271
What's a passport?

33:02.313 --> 33:05.476
Well, I have no idea what
kind of pass he's talking about,

33:05.583 --> 33:07.881
but, meowth, please stop
calling me "sport."

33:07.985 --> 33:09.009
You idiot!

33:09.086 --> 33:10.678
Hamburger!

33:10.721 --> 33:12.382
Hey, that ain't right.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.388
Cheeseburger!

33:13.491 --> 33:15.721
Computer: Alert. Alert. Alert.

33:19.230 --> 33:22.131
- Come on!
- Feed me!

33:23.601 --> 33:24.601
That was rude.

33:24.702 --> 33:25.999
Maybe she takes our order?

33:26.103 --> 33:29.834
Yeah, well, I'm pretty good
at giving orders.

33:29.907 --> 33:33.001
So I'm gonna have five
hamburgers well-done,

33:33.044 --> 33:34.841
and don't forget
the French fries.

33:34.912 --> 33:36.402
Well-done it is.

33:38.749 --> 33:40.341
Jessie got fried.

33:40.418 --> 33:42.511
Without the burgers.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.552
I think we should battle
together again.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.557
Bet we'll get it right
next time.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.559
Why do you keep following me?

33:49.660 --> 33:51.958
Gull! Gull!

33:52.063 --> 33:53.428
Aah!

33:54.966 --> 33:56.433
Are you okay?

33:56.534 --> 33:57.534
Pikachu.

33:57.635 --> 33:58.635
Aah!

34:00.771 --> 34:02.602
Gee, thanks.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.470
Why'd you have to go
and push me?

34:04.508 --> 34:06.601
May: Ash, stop.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.170
Don't start something.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.771
Okay.

34:12.683 --> 34:14.081
Oh!

34:14.118 --> 34:16.177
Hey. I know.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.915
Pika?

34:24.996 --> 34:26.827
Mmm. Perfect.

34:26.931 --> 34:27.829
Dig in.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.297
T'll go first.

34:29.367 --> 34:30.299
Second.

34:30.368 --> 34:32.199
Hold on.

34:32.303 --> 34:35.033
Whoa, it's hot.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.232
Yum!

34:36.306 --> 34:38.502
There's nothing
that can stop an argument better

34:38.609 --> 34:40.099
than a bunch of full mouths.

34:40.210 --> 34:43.304
Try some, Tory.
It's really good.

34:51.322 --> 34:52.322
You're right.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.356
Told you so.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.724
Guys, look at all those pokémon.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.161
Seedot.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.458
Well, hi.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.899
There's plenty of pokémon food,
so don't be shy.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.869
There. Dig in, guys.

35:06.971 --> 35:08.996
Seedot! Seedot.

35:09.573 --> 35:12.371
Tory, don't you think
they're the cutest?

35:12.476 --> 35:13.272
Yeah.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.176
Hey.
I bet they'd let you pet them.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.177
Pika!

35:16.280 --> 35:16.678
Uh...

35:16.781 --> 35:18.772
Pika.

35:23.487 --> 35:24.487
Pika.

35:26.991 --> 35:27.889
Thanks, guys.

35:27.992 --> 35:29.584
I'm sorry.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.925
Well, we tried.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.999
Ah, I'm sure we'll get through
to him eventually.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.533
Oh, guys!

35:37.601 --> 35:41.196
Munch, munch, munch.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.933
Oh, no, it's a munchlax,
and they love to eat.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.999
Well, guess it's doing
what it loves.

35:46.043 --> 35:47.101
Munch.

35:47.211 --> 35:50.009
Hey, you. That was our lunch.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.709
Munch!

35:53.050 --> 35:56.213
Munch!

35:57.521 --> 36:00.183
Munch. Munch. Munch.

36:00.257 --> 36:01.690
Munch.

36:02.393 --> 36:03.553
All: Wow.

36:04.895 --> 36:06.658
Hey, it's a plusle and minun.

36:06.697 --> 36:07.959
Hi, cuties.

36:07.998 --> 36:09.898
Pika, pika.

36:15.773 --> 36:17.968
- Pelipper!
- Pelipper!

36:22.813 --> 36:25.475
- Murkrow!
- Murkrow!

37:21.806 --> 37:23.797
Max: There's that light
in the sky again.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.273
Awesome.

37:25.376 --> 37:27.276
It's beautiful.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.779
But that's impossible.

37:29.814 --> 37:30.781
What is?

37:30.815 --> 37:32.783
That's called an Aurora,

37:32.883 --> 37:36.182
but it can only be seen at
the north and the south poles.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.915
Strange.

37:37.988 --> 37:41.924
Well, I guess we're lucky to be
able to see it here, right?

37:41.992 --> 37:45.985
The same kind of luck that
brought you and me together.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.328
Not sure what kind of luck
that was.

37:48.432 --> 37:49.797
Hi, beautiful.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.528
If you're looking
for a real phenomenon,

37:52.603 --> 37:55.731
stop looking in your computer
and spend some time with me.

37:55.806 --> 37:56.830
Okay.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.534
You leaving her alone.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.543
That's a phenomenon.

38:01.278 --> 38:03.246
Well, look who's still in town.

38:03.347 --> 38:04.143
So?

38:04.248 --> 38:07.240
After that devastating defeat
in front of thousands of people,

38:07.284 --> 38:10.151
I thought you might be a little
embarrassed to show your face.

38:10.254 --> 38:14.156
Oh, yeah? How about a rematch
tomorrow in the battle tower?

38:14.191 --> 38:15.351
No problem.

38:15.392 --> 38:18.293
I'll beat you anytime
and anywhere.

38:18.395 --> 38:21.193
I wouldn't count on that.

38:22.666 --> 38:25.294
Hey, I know you.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.859
Tory.

38:28.072 --> 38:29.300
Hey, you guys.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.967
Yuko and I made these for you.

38:32.009 --> 38:34.671
Max: Cool. Pokémon cookies.

38:34.712 --> 38:36.373
- Kathryn: Cute.
- Audrey: Yummy.

38:36.413 --> 38:38.973
Ash: Come on out, everyone.

38:40.284 --> 38:42.684
La-la la-la-la

38:42.720 --> 38:43.778
la la-la-la la

38:43.888 --> 38:44.479
both: Go!

38:44.522 --> 38:46.786
La-la la-la-la

38:46.891 --> 38:48.882
la la-la-la la

38:51.395 --> 38:53.420
there's a place I know

38:53.531 --> 38:55.431
it's always jumping

38:55.533 --> 38:59.629
I'm thinking we should go
and leave our worries

38:59.703 --> 39:01.933
you got a friend in me

39:01.972 --> 39:03.940
and I'll tell you something

39:03.974 --> 39:08.172
this time could be extraordinary

39:08.245 --> 39:12.443
when shadows fall,
you're feeling small

39:12.550 --> 39:16.543
it looks like walls
are closing in

39:16.654 --> 39:19.555
don't be afraid,
the dark will fade

39:19.590 --> 39:23.356
just take my hand and look again

39:23.394 --> 39:26.261
this side of paradise

39:26.297 --> 39:27.594
is where I want to be

39:27.698 --> 39:30.394
this side of paradise

39:30.467 --> 39:31.957
for you and me

39:32.069 --> 39:34.003
this side of paradise

39:34.104 --> 39:36.368
what you get is what you see

39:36.473 --> 39:40.466
and I never thought
I'd see a place as nice

39:40.511 --> 39:43.378
this side of paradise

39:43.414 --> 39:45.609
la la-la-la la

39:45.683 --> 39:47.913
la-la la-la-la

39:47.985 --> 39:50.215
la la-la-la la

39:50.287 --> 39:54.485
forget about the pain and doubt

39:54.592 --> 39:58.619
your happiness is overdue

39:58.729 --> 40:02.096
I've been dreaming of
the skies above

40:02.132 --> 40:05.590
dancing through the stars
with you

40:05.703 --> 40:09.901
oh, take me to

40:10.007 --> 40:12.601
this side of paradise

40:12.710 --> 40:14.109
is where I want to be

40:14.144 --> 40:16.704
this side of paradise

40:16.814 --> 40:18.406
for you and me

40:18.515 --> 40:20.642
this side of paradise

40:20.718 --> 40:22.515
what you get is what you see

40:22.553 --> 40:25.215
this side of paradise

40:25.322 --> 40:27.654
for you and me

40:28.325 --> 40:30.953
when is a sandwich
more than a sandwich?

40:31.061 --> 40:32.926
When the sandwich is a meal.

40:32.963 --> 40:34.555
For team rocket to steal.

40:34.665 --> 40:35.665
Both: Dinner.

40:38.535 --> 40:40.560
All: Ahh!

40:40.638 --> 40:42.265
Huh?

40:42.373 --> 40:44.238
Munch. Munch.

40:44.274 --> 40:45.434
Did that just happen?

40:45.476 --> 40:47.671
Munchlax. Munch.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.076
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

40:49.146 --> 40:51.137
It's stealing the food
we were stealing.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.340
Oh, no, it's not!

40:54.551 --> 40:57.645
Come back here,
you little thief!

41:04.728 --> 41:06.195
It's gone.

41:35.259 --> 41:38.251
You know,
I've never done that before.

41:38.362 --> 41:39.021
What?

41:39.063 --> 41:41.827
Just playing together
with a big bunch of friends.

41:41.865 --> 41:43.856
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:43.967 --> 41:47.869
I guess it's 'cause I've always
been so afraid of pokémon.

41:48.539 --> 41:52.270
So, I'm afraid to get close
to pokémon trainers, too.

41:52.342 --> 41:55.140
Guess I've missed out on a lot.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.046
That means you're always alone.

41:58.082 --> 41:59.344
Pika.

41:59.383 --> 42:01.180
Pikachu!

42:01.218 --> 42:02.913
But that's all in the past,
right?

42:02.986 --> 42:04.385
Pika!

42:04.488 --> 42:06.319
Uh...

42:08.325 --> 42:09.986
Hmm...

42:16.433 --> 42:17.900
- Corphish!
- Aah!

42:18.001 --> 42:19.400
- Corphish!
- Pika!

42:19.503 --> 42:20.902
Corphish! Corphish!

42:20.938 --> 42:23.304
It's okay.

42:23.407 --> 42:24.840
There's no rush.

42:24.908 --> 42:26.307
Okay.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.934
That's corphish.

42:28.011 --> 42:29.603
Cor...

42:29.713 --> 42:30.941
Pika.

42:31.014 --> 42:32.413
Phish.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.710
Come on, guys. There's someone
I want you to meet.

42:37.755 --> 42:39.313
Where are we going?

42:39.356 --> 42:43.224
Wherever it is, I hope there's
a kitchen. I'm starving.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.861
Your passports, please.

42:54.538 --> 42:56.335
Verified.

42:57.341 --> 42:59.241
My dad's lab
is right over there,

42:59.343 --> 43:02.608
so that's why there are so
many security robots all over.

43:11.321 --> 43:12.515
Come on out!

43:12.589 --> 43:14.079
I'm with my new friends.

43:14.191 --> 43:15.886
Come and meet them.

43:22.399 --> 43:25.027
So this is your friend, Tory?

43:25.102 --> 43:26.433
But what is it?

43:26.503 --> 43:27.731
It's gorgeous.

43:27.805 --> 43:28.805
And weird.

43:28.906 --> 43:31.841
It's always here for me
whenever I call for it.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.001
Yesterday I played
with all these guys

43:34.111 --> 43:36.136
and their pokémon, too.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.641
Wow, Tory, that's so cool.

43:38.715 --> 43:40.706
And it even understands
what I say.

43:40.818 --> 43:42.410
May: Is it a pokémon?

43:42.519 --> 43:44.111
Max:
Not one that I've ever seen.

43:44.221 --> 43:46.212
This is just fascinating.

43:46.323 --> 43:49.156
What do you say I introduce
my pokémon to it?

43:49.226 --> 43:50.716
Go!

43:52.963 --> 43:54.021
Blaze!

43:54.064 --> 43:55.554
Yeah. Mine, too.

43:55.666 --> 43:57.634
Together: Don't forget ours.

43:59.036 --> 44:00.799
- Blastoise!
- Masquerain!

44:00.871 --> 44:03.203
Now let me introduce mine.

44:04.608 --> 44:06.075
Metagross.

44:06.109 --> 44:07.576
A metagross.

44:07.611 --> 44:08.475
Awesome.

44:08.512 --> 44:09.672
Meta.

44:09.713 --> 44:11.772
Pika.

44:13.617 --> 44:15.608
Blast.

44:23.493 --> 44:25.927
I got you.

44:26.530 --> 44:27.997
Missed it.

44:28.098 --> 44:29.690
Pika.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.791
Pika!

44:48.719 --> 44:51.210
Unidentified object
approaching the building.

44:51.255 --> 44:53.621
Can you analyze it, please?

44:54.925 --> 44:56.620
It appears to be a rayquaza.

44:56.660 --> 44:57.957
Rayquaza?

44:58.061 --> 45:00.052
Contact professor lund
right now.

45:00.163 --> 45:01.391
Right.

45:04.668 --> 45:07.967
Professor, how could
a rayquaza be coming here?

45:08.005 --> 45:08.972
I don't know.

45:09.006 --> 45:11.099
But for it to leave
the ozone layer again,

45:11.208 --> 45:13.768
there must be a powerful reason.

45:20.684 --> 45:22.811
Do you see that?

45:22.886 --> 45:24.786
I'll magnify it.

45:27.524 --> 45:29.389
That's what I thought.

45:29.493 --> 45:30.892
It's deoxys.

45:42.839 --> 45:44.500
Computer: System malfunction.

45:44.608 --> 45:47.202
Losing regulatory control.

45:50.547 --> 45:52.105
Rayquaza must have come here

45:52.215 --> 45:54.809
after sensing
that deoxys was here as well.

45:54.851 --> 45:57.046
If those two battle it out
in our city,

45:57.120 --> 45:59.020
the result will be catastrophic.

45:59.122 --> 46:01.955
Evacuate larousse city
immediately.

46:02.059 --> 46:03.890
Right away, sir.

46:04.695 --> 46:07.892
Initiating emergency evacuation.

46:10.667 --> 46:14.398
Fellow citizens, we are facing
an emergency situation.

46:14.471 --> 46:16.496
Please evacuate immediately.

46:16.573 --> 46:19.565
- What's going on?
- Easy.

46:19.609 --> 46:21.270
It's party time.

46:21.378 --> 46:22.572
Please be patient.

46:22.612 --> 46:25.274
The next ferry
will arrive shortly.

46:41.431 --> 46:42.431
What's that?

46:42.532 --> 46:44.932
It sounds like the police.

46:49.506 --> 46:51.201
Tory's out in the garden.

46:51.308 --> 46:53.606
I have to go out and get him.

46:53.710 --> 46:55.905
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

46:56.013 --> 46:57.013
Right.

47:04.354 --> 47:05.878
Why won't your passport work?

47:05.956 --> 47:07.355
This never happens.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.357
Maybe the system
is shutting down.

47:14.598 --> 47:16.691
It stopped.

47:16.800 --> 47:17.960
Computer: Rebooting.

47:18.068 --> 47:19.592
Aah!

47:26.276 --> 47:27.573
Aah!

47:27.677 --> 47:28.769
Hey!

47:47.130 --> 47:49.189
- It's moving.
- Where are we going?

47:51.301 --> 47:53.792
- Excuse me.
- Watch it!

47:53.904 --> 47:55.895
Aah!

47:58.809 --> 48:00.538
Professor lund!

48:03.447 --> 48:05.540
Some vacation
this turned out to be.

48:05.582 --> 48:07.550
Whose bad idea was this?

48:07.651 --> 48:10.085
Let's just say meowth and I
were overruled.

48:10.153 --> 48:11.153
Oh?

48:32.175 --> 48:34.075
What's happening here?

48:34.111 --> 48:36.978
Those things
are carrying people away.

48:37.013 --> 48:40.073
Deoxys, why are you
doing this to us?

48:40.183 --> 48:41.878
Huh?

49:03.373 --> 49:04.863
The force field.

49:19.656 --> 49:20.953
Computer: Losing power.

49:21.057 --> 49:23.958
All systems will now shut down.

50:10.907 --> 50:12.602
Together: You got it.

50:12.709 --> 50:14.802
Hold on a sec.

50:19.015 --> 50:20.414
It's multiplying.

50:20.517 --> 50:21.916
What is that thing?

50:21.952 --> 50:23.214
Deoxys.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.344
You know its name?

50:24.421 --> 50:25.615
You guys, come back.

50:25.722 --> 50:26.950
Huh?

50:29.125 --> 50:30.854
No! May, look out.

50:30.961 --> 50:32.258
Hey, what do you want?

50:32.362 --> 50:34.557
Blastoise, use hydro pump. Go.

50:34.664 --> 50:35.756
Blastoise.

50:42.072 --> 50:43.437
Blastoise!

50:43.473 --> 50:45.236
Put me down!

50:45.275 --> 50:46.765
Blastoise!

50:46.876 --> 50:47.934
Blast!

50:47.978 --> 50:48.978
Sid, no!

50:49.045 --> 50:50.979
May, get in here.

50:51.982 --> 50:54.473
Blaziken, use flamethrower.

50:54.551 --> 50:57.042
Blaze.

50:58.054 --> 50:59.749
Pikachu, thunderbolt.

50:59.789 --> 51:02.019
Pikachu!

51:04.628 --> 51:06.425
Tory, is there another way out?

51:06.529 --> 51:08.622
Yeah.
There's an underground exit.

51:08.732 --> 51:09.790
Can you show us?

51:09.833 --> 51:11.198
Yes. Follow me.

51:11.301 --> 51:13.428
Everyone, let's go.

51:16.206 --> 51:18.538
Blaze!

51:19.109 --> 51:22.044
Chu!

51:22.112 --> 51:23.909
Blaze!

51:24.014 --> 51:25.014
Way to go, rafe.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.412
All'in a day's work.

51:30.654 --> 51:32.713
What do they want?

51:40.063 --> 51:41.121
Let's hurry.

51:41.164 --> 51:42.722
Come on, Brock, it's open.

51:42.832 --> 51:44.231
Okay.

51:44.334 --> 51:45.733
All right, ash, rafe.

51:45.835 --> 51:47.735
We gotta go.

51:48.538 --> 51:49.630
- Pikachu.
- Pika.

51:49.739 --> 51:50.865
Blaze.

51:54.144 --> 51:55.338
Blaze.

51:56.146 --> 51:57.738
Guys, this way.

52:06.589 --> 52:08.079
Pika!

52:08.191 --> 52:10.421
Pikachu, use thunderbolt now.

52:10.527 --> 52:14.827
Pikachu!

52:14.931 --> 52:19.129
Thanks, pikachu.
Good thunderbolt.

52:19.235 --> 52:20.896
Ash, what are you doing?
Let's go.

52:21.004 --> 52:23.302
This is the way
to get out of here.

52:31.214 --> 52:33.239
Wonder where we are now.

52:33.316 --> 52:35.648
It seems to be safe.

52:35.719 --> 52:36.743
There you are.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.913
It's yuko!

52:51.768 --> 52:53.565
Munch.

52:56.539 --> 52:58.029
Munch?

52:58.942 --> 53:00.307
Munch.

53:00.377 --> 53:03.175
Munch. Munch.

53:12.889 --> 53:16.689
Professor, take a look at all
of these people shown here.

53:16.726 --> 53:18.626
Their evacuation
hasn't been confirmed

53:18.728 --> 53:21.094
at any
of the passport checkpoints.

53:21.131 --> 53:26.433
I'm afraid that could mean
they're still stuck in larousse.

53:31.107 --> 53:33.803
The entire town is enclosed
within a force field.

53:33.843 --> 53:36.710
It's impossible for anyone
to come in or to leave.

53:36.813 --> 53:39.714
All communication with
the outside is jammed as well.

53:39.749 --> 53:41.717
They've switched
to backup generators,

53:41.818 --> 53:44.048
but all systems are still down.

53:44.120 --> 53:47.453
Even the pokéball management
system isn't functioning.

53:47.524 --> 53:49.014
Yeah, it won't work.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.922
How can we call out our pokémon?

53:51.027 --> 53:52.824
Guess we can't.

53:52.929 --> 53:55.921
Hey, Tory,
what did you call that thing?

53:55.965 --> 53:57.762
Was it deoxys?

53:57.867 --> 53:58.925
Yuko: That's right.

53:59.035 --> 54:01.265
A pokémon from outer space.

54:01.304 --> 54:02.669
What?

54:02.772 --> 54:06.708
Four years ago, a meteorite came
down and struck the north pole.

54:06.810 --> 54:10.610
And located inside of it was
a completely unknown pokémon.

54:10.680 --> 54:15.617
It was professor lund who gave
that pokémon the name deoxys.

54:16.186 --> 54:19.485
But then almost immediately
rayquaza appeared from the ozone

54:21.614 --> 54:26.328
and attacked deoys.

54:26.329 --> 54:28.422
Apparently,
rayquaza was threatened

54:28.531 --> 54:31.329
and thought deoxys
was invading its territory.

54:31.401 --> 54:35.303
Deoxys vanished
deep into the sea.

54:37.807 --> 54:40.401
I don't get it.
How could it be the same deoxys?

54:40.443 --> 54:42.411
After getting beaten
by rayquaza,

54:42.512 --> 54:45.208
deoxys must have slowly
been regenerating.

54:45.315 --> 54:46.509
Regenerating?

54:46.549 --> 54:49.848
That's right. It has astounding
regenerative powers.

54:49.919 --> 54:51.819
And that's what
professor lund and I

54:51.855 --> 54:54.415
have been studying
all these years.

54:58.828 --> 55:02.093
It sounds more like
science fiction.

55:02.165 --> 55:04.395
This is something
I'd love to research.

55:04.501 --> 55:06.969
But I wonder
if it could somehow get in

55:07.070 --> 55:09.561
through a crack in the wall.

55:09.606 --> 55:10.868
Knock it off, Max.

55:10.974 --> 55:13.272
Yeah. Stop scaring us right now.

55:13.376 --> 55:14.570
Just kidding.

55:14.677 --> 55:16.975
There's no way
it's coming in through a crack.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.775
What was that?

55:18.882 --> 55:20.975
Come on, blaziken.

55:21.084 --> 55:22.210
Blaziken, blaziken.

55:31.294 --> 55:32.886
Blaziken.

55:32.996 --> 55:33.996
Pika.

55:38.635 --> 55:40.227
- Oh!
- Pika!

55:45.508 --> 55:47.100
Munch.

55:47.944 --> 55:51.812
Hey, that's the pokémon
that ate every bite of our food.

55:52.115 --> 55:54.242
Are you stuck in there,
munchlax?

55:54.317 --> 55:55.807
Let's see.

56:01.758 --> 56:03.157
Qur sandwiches.

56:03.192 --> 56:05.456
Everything
but the peanut butter.

56:05.562 --> 56:08.395
And of course that one was mine.

56:11.167 --> 56:13.294
Wait. Hold on.

56:16.773 --> 56:20.903
Okay, please just don't come
any closer, you two.

56:22.312 --> 56:24.780
Pika. Pikachu.

56:26.683 --> 56:27.683
Munch.

56:28.885 --> 56:30.113
I'm so hungry.

56:30.186 --> 56:31.186
Soam I.

56:31.287 --> 56:32.686
Me too.

56:32.789 --> 56:34.188
Munch?

56:34.290 --> 56:35.484
Munchlax.

56:35.525 --> 56:37.390
Really? I can have it?

56:37.427 --> 56:39.418
Munch, munch.

56:39.495 --> 56:40.928
Munch, munch.

56:42.632 --> 56:43.826
All: No, thanks.

56:43.933 --> 56:45.127
Munch.

56:56.813 --> 56:59.247
We have to find food and water
right away.

56:59.315 --> 57:02.773
Great, and I'll try and find out
where those people were taken.

57:02.852 --> 57:05.844
Yuko, take care of my sisters,
please.

57:05.955 --> 57:08.287
Of course.
But don't you worry about us.

57:08.358 --> 57:10.849
- You take care of yourselves.
- We will.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.951
All right, let's go.

57:17.467 --> 57:20.197
Munchlax.

57:20.303 --> 57:23.295
Munchlax.

57:28.778 --> 57:30.473
I'm worried, Max.

57:30.580 --> 57:33.378
I really hope they're all okay.

57:33.883 --> 57:34.883
Yeah, me, too.

57:34.917 --> 57:37.010
I wish they'd hurry
and come back.

57:45.795 --> 57:48.127
Still no good.
Nothing's happening.

57:48.231 --> 57:50.631
Yeah, it must be tied
into the town's system.

57:50.733 --> 57:52.223
I can see the food in there.

57:52.335 --> 57:55.031
We just need to figure out
a way to break in.

57:55.138 --> 57:56.605
Pika, pika!

57:56.706 --> 58:01.439
Pikachu!

58:05.548 --> 58:06.446
It worked.

58:06.549 --> 58:08.244
Pikachu, great idea.

58:08.284 --> 58:10.377
Pikachu!

58:10.453 --> 58:13.286
Whoa! Gotta catch them all.

58:13.356 --> 58:16.348
Pika!

58:16.392 --> 58:17.859
Pikachu.

58:18.261 --> 58:19.592
Pika?

58:19.696 --> 58:22.494
Huh? What is it, pikachu?

58:26.069 --> 58:27.366
- Look out!
- Run!

58:27.470 --> 58:28.698
Pika!

58:32.709 --> 58:34.802
Pika!

58:38.514 --> 58:40.573
Plusle. Minun.

58:42.785 --> 58:45.379
- Put me down.
- Let go.

58:49.225 --> 58:50.988
Pikachu!

58:51.027 --> 58:52.995
Aah!

58:53.629 --> 58:55.494
No!

58:59.502 --> 59:01.834
Pika!

59:04.774 --> 59:06.969
Here they all come, guys.

59:07.043 --> 59:09.068
Come on, Tory. Let's go.

59:29.799 --> 59:31.767
It looks like they're all gone.

59:31.868 --> 59:33.392
That was close.

59:34.670 --> 59:37.104
Oh, plusle.

59:37.173 --> 59:39.107
It's all my fault.

59:39.175 --> 59:41.006
I should have...

59:46.582 --> 59:47.913
I'm sorry.

59:47.984 --> 59:50.077
Pika. Pika, pika.

59:50.119 --> 59:51.119
Pikachu.

59:53.689 --> 59:55.486
Ash.

59:55.525 --> 59:57.493
Look what I just found.

59:58.227 --> 59:59.592
Precious water.

59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.290
All right!

01:00:09.438 --> 01:00:12.601
Okay, so that's where they're
holding everyone captive.

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:16.007
I guess,
but what in the world for?

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.602
Computer: Release immediately.

01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:20.011
Release immediately.

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.216
Release.

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:34.119
It let go.

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:35.926
But why?

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.819
Hmm? Go back.

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:06.918
Let me just take
another look at that.

01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:08.029
Sure.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.690
Skit. Sur.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.292
Surskit. Surskit.

01:01:14.403 --> 01:01:15.631
What is it?

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.400
What's wrong?

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.104
Pika.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:35.556
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.115
Let's get out of here.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:39.558
Yuko: Yes, there's
an underground laboratory.

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:40.662
Let's go.

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.662
Follow me.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.460
Munchlax!

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:45.261
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.762
Try and stay calm.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.137
Now go.

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:15.190
We should be safe down here
for the time being.

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.528
That's good.

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:17.691
Blaze. Blaze.

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.399
Pika.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.640
Ash: What's this?

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:29.007
Yuko: The lab where we studied
deoxys and its regeneration.

01:02:29.111 --> 01:02:31.602
There were actually
two of them before.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:35.650
Rayquaza defeated one while the
other deoxys was still dormant

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.413
inside of this meteorite.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.919
Rebecca: You're saying that...

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.923
Yes. That crystal.

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:42.957
It's a part of deoxys.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.049
Part of.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.627
What do you mean?

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.033
What?

01:03:00.142 --> 01:03:01.666
Hey, Tory, it's your friend.

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.176
Pika.

01:03:03.879 --> 01:03:05.073
Wait a second.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.911
Then Tory's friend is...

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:07.711
Right.

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:09.808
It's deoxys.

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.533
That's it!

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.731
It all makes sense.

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:35.602
This is Tory's friend's
light pattern.

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:41.408
And this is the pattern of the
Aurora that covered larousse.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.815
It's the same.

01:03:42.918 --> 01:03:45.318
Yeah, I think it might be
how they communicate.

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.616
Oh. I see.

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:49.350
So, can you tell what it says?

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.258
Well, let's start
with the green pattern.

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:56.623
This one means "friend."

01:03:56.665 --> 01:04:00.863
And this one seems to be asking,
"where are you?"

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:03.268
So it's just looking
for its friend?

01:04:03.305 --> 01:04:04.067
Pika.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.071
Of course.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.699
Deoxys carried off
all those people and pokémon

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.074
because they were interfering

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:11.079
while it searched for its
friend.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.206
Deoxys sees certain types
of electrical fields.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:16.012
But it's not only
electrical devices

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.416
that give off those fields.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.681
So do people and pokémon.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:22.883
And they were blocking
its vision.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:25.085
That's why it's moving them
out of the way.

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.821
To find it.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:05.967
Please, yuko.

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:09.299
You've got to help
this deoxys regenerate.

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.963
It's so sad.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.974
It's been alone
all of this time.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.008
You're right.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.875
Once deoxys finds its friend,
it'll go back home.

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:18.913
Pikachu!

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:21.575
The problem is the emergency
power we're running on

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:24.676
isn't nearly enough necessary
to operate this device.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.621
If it's electricity you want,
then I'm your guy.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.783
I can get
the wind generators going.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.086
Together: Can we help?

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:34.528
We'll need everyone's help to
save those people and pokémon.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.030
Let's start working on a plan.

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:37.929
Then we'll go to where
they're being held.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.230
I'll zero in on it.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.499
That's where they all are.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.505
Great. Let's go get them, guys.

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.007
All: All right!

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:10.862
T'll never take an escalator
for granted again.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.880
Deoxys, we're not your enemies.

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:34.785
We're your friends.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:39.187
If you'll trust us, we can help
you find your friend.

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:41.219
I promise.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.932
Blaziken, use flamethrower now!

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.806
Pikachu, thunderbolt them.

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:57.310
Pikachu!

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.940
Metagross, use reflector.

01:07:02.384 --> 01:07:03.942
Meta.

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.850
Quick. Now's our chance.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:07.355
This way.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.652
Now overheat.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.762
Blaze!

01:07:17.399 --> 01:07:18.297
You okay?

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.698
We're fine, ash. Just go on.

01:07:20.769 --> 01:07:22.862
Rafe can handle it.

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:27.067
Just don't let anything happen
to my sisters, ash.

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:29.701
You can count on that.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.281
Blaziken, overheat.

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.577
Blaze!

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:01.338
Rayquaza has broken through.

01:08:01.443 --> 01:08:02.740
What have I done?

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:13.845
Blaze!

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.184
Relax, blaziken.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:16.656
Blaze.

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.124
Rayquaza.

01:08:58.233 --> 01:09:00.029
Now, what's that?

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:16.843
All right, let's do it just
like we planned, okay, guys?

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:17.975
Gotcha.

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.884
We're with you, ash.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.456
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

01:09:24.526 --> 01:09:26.015
Munchlax!

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:28.654
Come on! There's no time
for you to go back for it.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.358
Munchlax!

01:09:38.273 --> 01:09:39.171
You ready?

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:40.366
Just about.

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:42.001
All we need is the electricity.

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:45.376
But if we had that,
we wouldn't need to fix it.

01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:47.678
What are they doing over there?

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.684
I'm hoping he pulls
a sandwich out of that box.

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:53.778
From your lips to my stomach.

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:57.189
You guys,
we've come to help you.

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:59.283
Hey, ash, we're up here!

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.590
You got pikachu and plusle,
right?

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:02.697
Yeah.

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:03.698
We're all set.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.029
Pika!

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:55.748
Pikachu, plusle,
thunderbolt now!

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:59.686
Chu!

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.916
There's your electricity.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:06.084
That's good. Stop.

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:09.187
All right. We're recharged.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.831
Yeah!

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.698
All right!

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:35.820
You were great, Tory.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:18.431
Let's go.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.694
Yeah.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.932
That should do it.

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:29.400
Coming down!

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.423
Hey, may, I'm coming for you!

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:44.925
Was that sid?

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.325
Together: And rafe.

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:50.661
May!

01:12:51.733 --> 01:12:52.961
Gross.

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:54.330
Metagross.

01:12:55.737 --> 01:12:57.637
Audrey, Kathryn, you okay?

01:12:57.739 --> 01:12:59.229
Uh-huh. We're fine.

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.672
Where's ash and the others?

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.471
They went back
to the laboratory.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:05.378
Okay, are you ready
to get started on this?

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.318
Perfect. The power's back on.

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:23.125
- Yeah, those guys pulled it off.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.860
Blaziken.

01:13:55.964 --> 01:13:56.862
Blaziken.

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:59.832
Metagross.

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:17.078
My cramp's getting a cramp.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:21.613
We're always spinning our
wheels, but this is ridiculous.

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.317
Just pedal!

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:35.827
I'm set.

01:14:35.937 --> 01:14:37.837
Are you both ready to use
the laser?

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:38.634
Yes.

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:41.107
I think you
should turn it on, Tory.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:43.236
It is your friend, after all.

01:14:43.311 --> 01:14:45.905
So you should do it.

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.153
Here goes.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.180
Pika.

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.991
Still no good.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.797
Oh, no.

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.992
We're still 20% short on energy.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.829
Wow. We're so close.

01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:42.426
Okay, pikachu, plusle, minun.

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:43.528
You know what to do.

01:15:43.638 --> 01:15:45.538
Pika!

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:51.204
Pikachu!

01:16:09.664 --> 01:16:10.596
Great idea.

01:16:10.665 --> 01:16:12.098
We got just what we need.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.200
It works.

01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:14.996
All right.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.805
We did it!

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:58.006
Deoxys, it's really you.

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:13.457
Pika!

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:33.074
Deoxys, do you want to go
find your friend now?

01:17:39.387 --> 01:17:40.979
Both: Oh!

01:17:41.489 --> 01:17:43.013
Pika?

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:47.190
Pika!

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.587
The force field's gone.

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:48.485
Just like that?

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:52.062
Pika!

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:11.385
Hey, knock it off.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:12.916
Stop, rayquaza.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.621
Pika.

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:49.861
Warning.

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:50.760
Warning.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:51.865
Warning.

01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:53.433
Danger.

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.535
Danger.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:55.933
Danger.

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.735
Evacuate.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.808
Evacuate.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.103
What happened?

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:05.203
Security somehow started up.

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:25.593
Warning. Evacuate.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.635
Warning. Evacuate.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:32.503
Warning. Evacuate.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:36.340
Warning. Evacuate.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:40.237
Munch, munch.

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:58.555
Somehow security
has gone on overdrive.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.896
It won't shut down.

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:02.869
- Yuko.
- Professor lund.

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:39.835
Everything's totally
out of control.

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:41.602
Ash, I'm scared.

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:51.314
Rayquaza. Deoxys.

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.819
Pika!

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.412
Whoa!

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.224
Plusle. Minun.

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.623
Pikachu!

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.818
- Whoa!
- Pika!

01:24:59.927 --> 01:25:01.485
They almost hit us that time.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:03.359
Let's try and get back to yuko.

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:05.195
Tory, can you hear me?

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:06.790
- Tory?
- Daddy.

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:09.199
You must listen to me
very carefully.

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:12.706
As you can see, all of the
block robots are malfunctioning.

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:16.004
The chief robot which controls
all other block robots

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.374
should be near you.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:20.677
We no longer have power
over that robot from the booth.

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:21.807
Understand?

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.714
So here's what you have to do.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.810
And I need for you to be brave.

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:28.481
Tory, do you have your passport?

01:25:28.589 --> 01:25:31.387
You must present your passport
to the chief robot.

01:25:31.426 --> 01:25:35.692
Then everything should unlock,
but only for a brief moment.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.789
That should allow us
just enough time

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:41.892
to regain control and
shut down the security system.

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:44.301
Block robots are surrounding
the battle tower,

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:46.830
making any approach
by us impossible.

01:25:46.908 --> 01:25:49.308
Son, the fate of our town
is in your hands.

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:51.744
I know we can count on you.

01:25:58.019 --> 01:25:59.019
Computer: Warning.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.088
Evacuate.

01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:02.588
Warning.

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:05.353
Evacuate.

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.701
Don't you worry, sir.

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:18.762
Pikachu and I are gonna help
Tory save this town.

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:19.864
Together.

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:21.271
Pika!

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:24.574
We've gotta get to that tower.

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:27.581
Look at that.

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:29.879
Quick. Let's go.

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.390
Okay. Just a little more.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.987
Whoa!

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.798
Munch! Munch, munch.

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.731
Munchlax?

01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.804
Snorlax.

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:01.745
A snorlax?

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.341
That's it!

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:06.486
Sorry.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.184
- Oh!
- Pika!

01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:16.263
Hey, ash!

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:17.764
Tory, don't worry.

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:18.891
I'm okay.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.468
I'll take care of this.

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:26.765
Pika.

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.569
Pikachu!

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:33.271
Pika!

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.905
Oh, wow. Cool.

01:27:34.982 --> 01:27:37.109
I'm right behind you.

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:49.886
Pikachu!

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:01.466
Aah! No!

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:03.677
Oh, no!

01:28:03.744 --> 01:28:04.676
Pikachu!

01:28:04.745 --> 01:28:08.146
Ash, use my passport!

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:09.682
Throw it!

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.058
Pika.

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:21.894
Pika!

01:28:22.763 --> 01:28:24.856
Pikachu!

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:26.196
Pika, pika!

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.666
Pikachu!

01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:34.098
Aah! Aah!

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:51.083
This better work!

01:28:52.426 --> 01:28:54.826
Computer:
Passport has been verified.

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:57.227
Disengaging all locks.

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.026
I'm almost there.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.431
Disengage!

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:32.293
It worked, guys.

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.769
Oh, no! Tory!

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:54.982
Deoxys.

01:29:59.126 --> 01:30:00.286
Pika!

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:03.428
Pikachu!

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:20.937
Pika, pika!

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:30.520
Pika, pika.

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:33.049
Pika!

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:56.845
Snorlax.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:11.623
Tory!

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.324
Daddy!

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:15.926
Tory.

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:17.095
Hi, dad.

01:31:17.204 --> 01:31:19.798
I'm so happy you're safe.

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:23.399
But I'm only okay
'cause of my friends.

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:38.822
Come on, guys.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:40.655
That tickles.

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.134
Pika.

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.578
Goodbye.

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.381
T'll miss you.

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:14.894
I wonder where they're going.

01:32:14.995 --> 01:32:16.087
Yeah.

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:19.588
But now, wherever they go,
they'll always have each other.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.725
Pikachu.

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.938
Hey, pikachu.

01:32:36.016 --> 01:32:39.042
I'm glad that you and I
will always have each other.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.212
Pika.

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:42.518
Pikachu!

01:32:46.927 --> 01:32:49.361
I must have lost
20 pounds so far.

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.057
And you already lost you mind.

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:55.465
And I'm losing my Patience, so
just shut up and keep pedaling.

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.332
La-la la-la-la

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:59.736
la la-la-la la

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:02.106
la-la la-la-la

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:06.270
there's a place I know

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.280
it's always jumping

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:12.478
I'm thinking we should go
and leave our worries

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.579
you got a friend in me

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.681
and I'll tell you something

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:20.922
this time could be extraordinary

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:25.192
when shadows fall,
you're feeling small

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:29.292
it looks like walls
are closing in

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:32.304
don't be afraid,
the dark will fade

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:36.103
just take my hand and look again

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:39.008
this side of paradise

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.410
is where I want to be

01:33:40.447 --> 01:33:43.143
this side of paradise

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.707

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.810
this side of paradise

01:33:46.854 --> 01:33:49.118
what you get is what you see

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:53.216
and I never thought
I'd see a place as nice

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.127

we're gonna catch that train

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:11.370
when you're at my side,
the world has hope, and

01:34:11.478 --> 01:34:13.571
as we pass on by

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:15.582
we all look the same

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:19.814
the clouds are high,
the world is open

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:24.085
forget about the pain and doubt

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:28.218
your happiness is overdue

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:31.696
I've been dreaming of
the skies above

01:34:31.732 --> 01:34:35.429
dancing through the stars
with you

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:39.495

There's a place I know

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:46.006
it's always jumping

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:49.942
I'm thinking we should go
and leave our worries

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:52.501
you got a friend in me

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.514
and I'll tell you something

01:35:54.548 --> 01:35:58.746
this time could be extraordinary

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:02.949
when shadows fall,
you're feeling small

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:07.050
it looks like walls
are closing in

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:10.289
don't be afraid,
the dark will fade

01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:13.855
just take my hand and look again

01:36:13.968 --> 01:36:16.766
