00:03.960 --> 00:05.960
-I'm Cameron.
-I'm Bella.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.080
I'm just gonna go.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.040
Your aunt left the house to you.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.560
I fear this new family may suffer
the same fate as Bridget.

00:12.760 --> 00:13.760
Murder most foul!

00:13.920 --> 00:16.880
I thought your aunt died naturally.
Aunt Bridget?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.040
You'll never be one of us, outsider.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.480
(TARA) What's happening? Who are they?

00:21.600 --> 00:24.680
The founders.
They're saying that it's you, Tara.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.760
(AUNT BRIDGET)
It's you who have the old powers.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.360
# I left my friends for my new life

00:34.480 --> 00:37.480
# How will I know
It's gonna be alright?

00:37.600 --> 00:44.160
# I got to take control
And write my destiny

00:44.360 --> 00:49.680
# The future's still untold
Nobody else can see

00:49.880 --> 00:54.600
# If this will be for Evermoor #

01:00.920 --> 01:03.440
(TARA) What is normal?

01:03.560 --> 01:07.480
Sure, this was a funky place,

01:07.640 --> 01:09.840
weirdly not marked on any map...

01:10.000 --> 01:15.520
And you’d always, always be an outsider
if you weren’t born here.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.320
But it started to feel normal...

01:27.480 --> 01:29.760
With one exception...

01:38.160 --> 01:40.160
It’s time...
(GASPS)

01:40.360 --> 01:42.760
for your training to begin.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.320
Aunt Bridget. The weaving of my family.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.880
Why is it fading?

01:48.920 --> 01:53.000
Well, every prediction fades
after it has come to pass.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.840
Now, all we need is golden thread.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.920
The spider will provide it.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.040
I told you,
I don’t want to steal from Cameron.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.480
How are your fingers?

02:04.600 --> 02:07.000
Lit up any rooms lately?

02:09.600 --> 02:12.360
That’s the Supreme Everine in you
trying to get out.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.160
The ability to create the future
is a great power.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.480
It’ll only get worse.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.480
Please, Aunt Bridget.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.400
I just want to be normal.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.600
You can’t change who you are, Tara.

Good morning, Sebastian.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.320
We can’t be together, remember?

02:51.320 --> 02:55.120
You chose your Circle over me.
It’s too late now, so you may as well go.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.600
I’m here for the Circle meeting.
Oh.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.560
To be Chosen is fate.
I am powerless against it.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.680
It hurts me just as much
as it does you.

03:05.880 --> 03:10.440
That’s it then?
Whilst I’m in the Circle, yes.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.000
Well, if you ever leave,
come look me up.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.640
So let me get this straight,

03:26.840 --> 03:30.280
the girl no longer existed,
but the guy could still remember her?

03:30.440 --> 03:33.640
Right. Because she made
such an impression on him.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.160
I don't think that's believable.
(SCOFFS)

03:36.360 --> 03:38.440
What, you asked for my opinion.

03:38.560 --> 03:42.440
When people ask you for their opinion,
they just want you to tell them

03:42.560 --> 03:45.560
that it’s really good
and they’re amazing!

I need to use the table.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.960
(THUDS) Cam, I want your opinion
on something now.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.800
Be honest. I can take it.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.480
I, um... I weaved it myself.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.600

04:19.120 --> 04:20.480
Thank you.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.320
I’m honored to be Chosen
as one of the few entitled

04:23.480 --> 04:25.880
to sew on the great

04:26.000 --> 04:27.520
When does the weaving begin?

04:27.680 --> 04:29.840
Never!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
There is no golden thread,

04:32.120 --> 04:35.600
and we have lost the tapestry
to outsiders.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.920
This is our last meeting.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.000
I’ve gathered you all here to tell you...

04:44.000 --> 04:46.480
that I’m disbanding the Circle.

Hey, Flynn boy, I got you something.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.640

because it’s for Cameron’s own good

05:37.680 --> 05:39.360
What am I supposed to do now?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.560
Go knit a sweater.

I saved the best 'til last, Jakey Boy.
Need to give thanks to the sacred Snoot.

something, and I got you.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.000
(LUDO) Not a snoot, the snoot.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.080

You could’ve told me it’s an owl!
I have a fear of birds!

06:51.840 --> 06:54.280
It’s not an owl. It’s the snoot.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.920
Where I come from, that’s an owl.
And I come from the rest of the world.

(AUNT BRIDGET) You seem unusually quiet.
Everything go okay getting the thread?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.680
Yep. It’s like
I’ve been stealing magic thread

my whole life.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.920
-Ouch!
-Hmm.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.880
Perhaps we should try something simple.

08:35.280 --> 08:41.560
Aunt Bridget, there’s no way anyone could,
like, take my powers, is there?

08:41.720 --> 08:44.920
Not without knowing who you are.
That’s why it’s so important

08:45.040 --> 08:49.560
your identity remains hidden.
From Esmerelda especially.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.200
But even better.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.640
What if we made Esmerelda think
she was the Supreme Everine?

08:58.800 --> 09:02.440
She wouldn’t look for anyone else.
I can make her think she’s magic.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.720
-How?
-What if we made her fly?

09:05.880 --> 09:09.880
She touches this flying symbol,
and up she goes like a balloon.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.680
You want to turn your number one enemy
into Mary Poppins?

09:14.840 --> 09:18.000

requires intricate sewing

-Yep.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.120
We’ll find him for you, Mr. Mayor.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.680
For a small reward, of course.
Right, boys?

09:42.840 --> 09:46.520

You bring that snoot home.

for the Supreme Everine.

15:39.040 --> 15:45.360
(SQUEEZY BOTTLE SQUIRTING)

(JAKE SCREAMING, FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)

(GRUNTING)
I think I got him! I think I’ve got him!

15:54.240 --> 15:56.680
-That’s me!
-Oh, your legs are really hairy.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.400
(JAKE) It’s a snoot, not a bird!

15:59.600 --> 16:00.840
(METAL CLANGS)

16:01.000 --> 16:03.680
He’s in the cage! Grab the torch!
(TORCH CLICKS)

16:05.360 --> 16:08.840
In this town,
we call that a bonding experience.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.680
(JAKE GASPING, PANTING)

16:15.360 --> 16:19.080
What did I do? What did I do?

16:26.760 --> 16:29.800
-It’s you, isn’t it?
-What?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.400
You’re the Supreme Everine.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.760
I saw you. Your hands.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.680
Some Supreme Everine.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.040
I only have the power
to make things worse.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.200
You know my father started preparing me
for the Choosing when I was four.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.000
I never forgot the story of Cotton Lively,

16:52.120 --> 16:55.280
an Everine in Training
who it was predicted would be Chosen,

16:55.440 --> 16:57.640
but she got Gillypox
before the ceremony,

16:57.800 --> 17:01.000
was kept in her attic
while another was Chosen in her place.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.280
Sorsha. My stepsister’s just been eaten.
I’m not in the mood for stories.

17:05.440 --> 17:09.560
Cotton escaped, Tara,
swearing revenge on the Everines,

17:09.720 --> 17:12.440
never made it past
breaking into the tapestry room

17:12.640 --> 17:16.000
and trying to weave,
where she was swallowed by the tapestry.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.960
Parents used to say to children,

17:18.080 --> 17:21.120
"Do as you’re told or Cotton Lively
will come for you."

17:21.280 --> 17:25.880
It was said that only a Supreme Everine
could retrieve someone from the tapestry

17:26.000 --> 17:28.640
by weaving this symbol
to create an opening.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.080
Only, there was no Supreme one...

17:32.240 --> 17:34.200
Until now.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.120
I can fix this.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.400
It’s time.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.240
Remember, one wrong stitch,

17:51.400 --> 17:55.880
and everything we know and love
could be sucked into the tapestry too.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
You need to work on your pep talks!

18:00.400 --> 18:01.760

(TARA GASPS)
Concentrate! Clear your mind!

18:20.240 --> 18:23.800
I’m trying! What if I get a stitch wrong?

18:23.960 --> 18:28.560
Tara. I wouldn’t train you
if I didn’t think you could do this.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.040
Did I do it wrong?

19:11.440 --> 19:14.200
(THUNDER RUMBLES, WIND HOWLING)

19:16.160 --> 19:20.240
(BOTH GROANING)

19:24.400 --> 19:28.200
-What just happened?
-I saved you.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.040
It’s not me, is it?

19:33.360 --> 19:36.040
You’re the magic one.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.280
Please don’t tell anyone. Esmerelda
would try to take everything from me.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.080
(DOOR BANGS)
(GASPS)

19:47.960 --> 19:49.440
Great one?

19:52.720 --> 19:54.960
No, I’m not.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.320
I’m the Supreme one. (SIGHS)

20:00.520 --> 20:04.360
See, Everine. Testing us.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.240
Now get out.
All this travel has made me tired.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.760
I want to be alone.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.160
Can you make me fly again?

20:17.320 --> 20:20.720
Not unless you want to end up
like Cotton Lively again.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.560
Who’s Cotton Lively?

20:22.720 --> 20:24.440
She’s who’ll come for you

20:24.640 --> 20:28.160
if you don’t do what you’re told.

(NARRATOR) Next time...

21:02.520 --> 21:06.200
(ESMERELDA)
Supreme Everine has come to us.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.520
Cotton Lively
came out of the tapestry.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.840
(OTTO) We need to get to her
before she infects the village.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.920
Thou art accursed for all time.
