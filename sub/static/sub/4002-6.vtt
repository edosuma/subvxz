TAKING THE NIGHT OFF?

12:04.959 --> 12:06.542
MM...

12:11.583 --> 12:13.917
SO, UM...BEER?

12:13.917 --> 12:14.959
SURE.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.458
POT?

12:16.458 --> 12:18.500
FUCK YOU.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.041
SOUNDED KIND OF UPSET
ON THE PHONE.

12:25.041 --> 12:27.917
I'M KIND OF UPSET
IN PERSON TOO.

12:29.959 --> 12:32.000
UM...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.709
YOU DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE

12:34.709 --> 12:37.750
ABOUT ME BRINGING WENDELL IN
FOR QUESTIONING?

12:37.750 --> 12:41.083
NO. I DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

12:41.083 --> 12:44.291
I TRY TO KEEP THE WHOLE C.I.
THING UNDER WRAPS, YOU KNOW?

12:44.291 --> 12:46.583
THEN HOW THE HELL
DID IT GET OUT?

12:46.583 --> 12:50.417
WELL, IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET
WENDELL DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY.

12:52.959 --> 12:56.000
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
WHAT THIS SICKO DID TO HIM.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.959
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T.

12:57.959 --> 13:00.083
WHAT WOULD MAKE ANYONE
GO THAT HARD

13:00.083 --> 13:02.375
ON SOME STREET KID,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES?

13:02.375 --> 13:04.583
THERE'S THIS GUY
I'M LOOKIN' AT...

13:04.583 --> 13:06.667
HE'S A COP WHO HAD A BEEF
WITH FREEBO.

13:06.667 --> 13:10.875
HE SAW ME IN THE STATION
WHEN I WAS QUESTIONING WENDELL.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.000
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST
TIME THE BOYS IN BLUE

13:13.000 --> 13:17.667
HANDLED THEIR OWN
BUSINESS, RIGHT?

13:17.667 --> 13:21.792
I CAN'T RULE OUT THAT I PUT
WENDELL IN THE CROSSHAIRS.

13:21.792 --> 13:25.417
HE TRUSTED ME
ENOUGH TO COOPERATE, AND...

13:27.417 --> 13:29.625
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

13:35.709 --> 13:39.458
HEY, LOOK...

13:39.458 --> 13:41.750
EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,

13:41.750 --> 13:44.250
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
KNOWN, RIGHT?

13:47.041 --> 13:48.792
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.041
IT'S WHAT I DO BEST,
HUH?

14:06.083 --> 14:08.333
I SHOULD GO.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.959
ALL RIGHT.

14:12.834 --> 14:15.125
HEY, UM...

14:15.125 --> 14:17.709
HEY, LOOK, UM...

14:17.709 --> 14:20.709
THAT GIRL FROM
THE OTHER NIGHT WAS...

14:20.709 --> 14:22.417
WAS NOTHING SERIOUS.

14:22.417 --> 14:27.083
UH, WELL...IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS ANYWAY.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.667
YEAH, RIGHT.

14:30.917 --> 14:33.041
RIGHT.

14:33.041 --> 14:34.417
JENNA KENDRICK.

14:34.417 --> 14:38.000
ONE OF THE FIRST CRIME SCENES
I WORKED BLOOD SPATTER.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.083
THIS IS SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.125
AND THAT WAS DONE TO HER
BY THIS ANIMAL.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.542
CLEMSON GALT.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.458
ARYAN AFFILIATED.

14:50.458 --> 14:53.250
TOOK A CLAW HAMMER TO HER
FOR GETTING PREGNANT.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.542
HE WAS ARRESTED
FOR MURDER,

14:55.542 --> 14:56.917
EVEN CONFESSED
TO HIS CELLMATE.

14:56.917 --> 14:58.250
HE CALLED IT "HAMMER TIME."

14:58.250 --> 14:59.709
THEY GET A CONVICTION?

14:59.709 --> 15:03.542
GALT'S ARYAN AFFILIATES
EITHER GOT WITNESSES TO RECANT

15:03.542 --> 15:04.875
OR MADE THEM DISAPPEAR.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.875
VERDICT CAME BACK
NOT GUILTY.

15:06.875 --> 15:09.375
THAT--THAT TYPE OF STUFF
HAPPENS WAY TOO OFTEN.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.208
GALT'S DOING 15 TO 20
FOR ARMED ROBBERY

15:12.208 --> 15:13.709
IN A SUPERMAX UPSTATE.

15:13.709 --> 15:15.125
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING,
AT LEAST.

15:15.125 --> 15:16.500
GET HIM OFF THE STREETS.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.834
ONLY HE'S STILL RUNNING THINGS
FROM HIS PRISON CELL.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.750
THE WIFE AND THREE KIDS
OF AN ARYAN DEFECTOR,

15:21.750 --> 15:23.542
KILLED WITH A CLAW HAMMER.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.750
WHILE YOU'RE SLEEPING
LIKE A BABY,

15:26.750 --> 15:30.125
THIS IS WHO'S
KEEPING ME UP NIGHTS.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.250
(Dexter)
JUSTICE COMES AT A PRICE,

15:34.250 --> 15:37.667
ONE THAT MIGUEL IS ABOUT
TO DISCOVER HE CAN'T AFFORD.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.250
THIS ASSHOLE DOESN'T
DESERVE TO BREATHE, OKAY?

15:40.250 --> 15:43.291
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY
ARGUMENT WITH ME ABOUT THAT.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.583
BUT HE'S IN CUSTODY.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.333
IN A SUPERMAX, NO LESS.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.542
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE PROBLEM.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.625
YOU'RE THE BIG DEAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT GUY.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.917
I BET YOU COULD
GET US ACCESS.

15:55.917 --> 15:58.875
THAT--THAT'S BEYOND
DANGEROUS, DEXTER.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.125
THAT'S CRAZY!

16:00.125 --> 16:01.792
(Dexter)
I KNEW IF I APPEALED
TO REASON,

16:01.792 --> 16:05.166
MIGUEL WOULD EVENTUALLY
UNDERSTAND THE DOWNSIDE.

16:05.166 --> 16:06.458
NE-NEVER MIND
THAT MY FINGERPRINTS

16:06.458 --> 16:08.250
WILL BE ALL OVER THIS!

16:08.250 --> 16:11.333
(Dexter)
REASON LEADS
TO SELF-PRESERVATION,

16:11.333 --> 16:13.792
A POTENT FORCE.

16:13.792 --> 16:16.959
WE BOTH WOULD BE SERIOUSLY
EXPOSED HERE.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.542
[exhales]

16:19.542 --> 16:21.208
I JUST NEED TO SIT BACK.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.959
HE'LL SEE THE PROS ARE HEAVILY
OUTWEIGHED BY THE CONS,

16:23.959 --> 16:27.083
AND WE'LL BE BACK TO MOJITOS
AND BARBECUES.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.208
YEAH, WHEN YOU GET
RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

16:31.208 --> 16:34.125
I GUESS ETHAN TURNER
WAS AN ACCIDENT OF OPPORTUNITY,

16:34.125 --> 16:36.000
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
THING.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.625
WHAT ABOUT FREEBO?

16:38.625 --> 16:40.959
ANOTHER ACCIDENT
OF OPPORTUNITY?

16:40.959 --> 16:45.250
WELL, THAT SITUATION
JUST SORT OF...UNFOLDED.

16:45.250 --> 16:47.917
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:47.917 --> 16:51.625
WE BOTH HAVE
TOO MUCH TO LOSE.

16:51.625 --> 16:54.875
HEY, WE TOOK OUT
THE GARBAGE...TWICE.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.917
WE SHOULD QUIT
WHILE WE'RE AHEAD.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.542
NO.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.959
I OWE YOU THIS ONE, DEXTER.

17:02.959 --> 17:04.959
YOU STUCK YOUR NECK
OUT FOR ME TWICE NOW.

17:04.959 --> 17:06.667
NO, YOU DON'T OWE ME--
FAIR IS FAIR.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.542
AND I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.834
BUT WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH A REAL PLAN.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.583
AGAIN...WE.

17:17.583 --> 17:18.959
[elevator bell dings]

17:18.959 --> 17:20.959
MIGUEL SURPRISED ME
LAST NIGHT.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.000
I EXPECTED HIM TO SAY NO

17:22.000 --> 17:24.417
AND HE GAVE ME A DEFINITE
MAYBE INSTEAD.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.542
HEY.

17:25.542 --> 17:26.542
NO DOUGHNUTS TODAY?

17:26.542 --> 17:28.625
NOT TODAY, VINCE.

17:28.625 --> 17:31.125
TALK ABOUT YOUR
PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.917
CLEMSON GALT HAS BEEN
ON MY TOP TEN LIST FOR YEARS,

17:33.917 --> 17:35.709
AND MIGUEL
COULD BE A BIG HELP.

17:35.709 --> 17:38.208
BUT THE GOAL HERE
ISN'T TO SATISFY MY NEED.

17:38.208 --> 17:40.834
IT'S TO GET MIGUEL
TO FIND SOME OTHER HOBBY.

17:40.834 --> 17:43.041
DEXTER.
GOT A MINUTE?

17:44.792 --> 17:46.792
WHO'S SICK?

17:46.792 --> 17:48.208
UH, REMEMBER CAMILLA
FROM RECORDS?

17:48.208 --> 17:49.542
SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:49.542 --> 17:52.291
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD,
SO I GOT EVERYONE TO SIGN.

17:52.291 --> 17:53.750
CAMILLA'S SICK?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.291
SORRY,
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.291
LUNG CANCER.
IT'S TERMINAL.

17:58.291 --> 17:59.875
JUST LIKE GENE.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.709
CAMILLA'S HUSBAND.

18:01.709 --> 18:03.417
MY FOLKS USED TO PLAY
CARDS WITH THEM

18:03.417 --> 18:05.083
WHEN DEB AND I
WERE GROWING UP.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.917
HE DIED JUST LAST YEAR.
LUNG CANCER TOO.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.250
SMOKERS?

18:09.250 --> 18:10.333
AH, CHIMNEYS.

18:10.333 --> 18:13.041
LIFE CATCHES UP.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.709
YEAH.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.917
SO DOES DEATH.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.041
IT'S A SHAME.
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

18:19.041 --> 18:20.709
IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE WAS A FRIEND.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.625
A GOOD FRIEND.

18:25.917 --> 18:28.709
THOSE ARE IN SHORT
SUPPLY THESE DAYS.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.333
CAMILLA'S
AT GOOD SAMARITAN.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.375
YOU COULD DROP THAT OFF,

18:31.375 --> 18:33.542
LET HER KNOW
SHE'S IN OUR PRAYERS.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.333
I'LL DO THAT.

18:35.333 --> 18:36.500
THANKS.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.792
(Batista)
DETECTIVE GIANNA,

18:37.792 --> 18:40.083
SERGEANT BATISTA,
MIAMI-METRO HOMICIDE.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.083
HOW CAN I HELP YOU,
SERGEANT?

18:42.083 --> 18:45.542
I WAS, UH, WONDERING,
DETECTIVE...

18:45.542 --> 18:48.500
MAYBE WE COULD...

18:48.500 --> 18:50.458
SEE EACH OTHER.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.375
AS--AS IN A...A DATE?

18:53.375 --> 18:55.375
WELL, YEAH.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.166
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

18:57.166 --> 19:00.375
LOOK, UM, SERGEANT,
LET--LET'S BE CLEAR.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.417
'CAUSE BEING CLEAR

19:02.417 --> 19:04.375
WILL SAVE US BOTH
A LOT OF AGITA.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.959
HEY!

19:05.959 --> 19:08.208
I, UH...

19:08.208 --> 19:11.291
I DON'T DATE. EVER.

19:11.291 --> 19:14.125
DO YOUAT...EVER?

19:15.458 --> 19:16.834
SOMETIMES.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.500
GOOD NUTRITION'S
IMPORTANT.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.667
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, SERGEANT.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.750
I GET HUNGRY ENOUGH,
I WILL CALL YOU.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.125
ANGEL?

19:38.625 --> 19:39.917
WHAT?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.417
CAN I THROW
SOMETHING AT YOU

19:41.417 --> 19:42.667
THAT MIGHT SOUND
A LITTLE CRAZY?

19:42.667 --> 19:44.792
CRAZY? FROM YOU?

19:46.875 --> 19:48.542
RAMON PRADO.
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

19:48.542 --> 19:50.375
DO WE LIKE HIM
FOR THE SKINNER?

19:55.417 --> 19:57.417
OKAY, THAT'S NOT
A LITTLE CRAZY.

19:57.417 --> 19:58.792
HE HAS ACCESS
TO ALL OF OUR RECORDS,

19:58.792 --> 20:00.417
SO HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHO I'VE BEEN TALKING TO.

20:00.417 --> 20:01.667
AND WE'VE ALL SEEN HIM
UP CLOSE--

20:01.667 --> 20:03.333
THIS IS NOT
A STABLE GUY.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.458
HE'S A FUCKING WHACK J.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.375
I LOOKED INTO
HIS WORK SCHEDULE.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.709
HE WAS OFF DUTY WHEN
THE LAST TWO MURDERS WENT DOWN.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.500
YOU SERIOUSLY WANNA LOOK
AT RAMON PRADO

20:11.500 --> 20:13.458
FOR MULTIPLE HOMICIDE?

20:13.458 --> 20:15.458
IF ONLY TO RULE HIM OUT.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.208
NOT ONLY HAVE WE
NOT FOUND THE PERP

20:17.208 --> 20:19.458
THAT KILLED MIGUEL PRADO'S
LITTLE BROTHER,

20:19.458 --> 20:22.041
NOW YOU WANNA INVESTIGATE
HIS OTHER BROTHER FOR MURDER?

20:22.041 --> 20:24.458
IN A NUTSHELL.

20:24.458 --> 20:27.458
CAN'T IGNORE SOMETHING
JUST 'CAUSE IT'S MESSY.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.834
IF I'M RIGHT,
THIS IS HUGE.

20:29.834 --> 20:30.875
AND IF YOU'RE WRONG,

20:30.875 --> 20:32.875
EVERYONE INVOLVED
WILL BE SHITTING BLOOD

20:32.875 --> 20:34.709
DUE TO ACTS
I'D RATHER NOT DESCRIBE.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.083
THANKS FOR THAT,
SARGE.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.458
I'VE GOT A GUT FEELING.

20:39.458 --> 20:42.000
YOU, UH, WANNA GO
TO THE LIEUTENANT WITH THIS?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.333
I CAN'T GO TO LAGUERTA
WITH THIS.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.625
YOU FOLLOW UP...

20:48.625 --> 20:50.250
OFF THE GRID,

20:50.250 --> 20:51.458
AND IT'S ON YOU.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.667
THANK YOU, SARGE.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.458
RAMON'S OFF DUTY TONIGHT
AND TOMORROW.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.458
I'LL SET UP ON HIM,
I'LL SEE WHAT SHAKES LOOSE.

20:56.458 --> 20:57.709
IF YOU NEED COMPANY...

20:57.709 --> 20:59.250
I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.750
AND TRY TO BE DISCREET,
WILL YOU?

21:01.750 --> 21:03.500
FOR A CHANGE

21:03.500 --> 21:04.875
YEAH.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.250
DEXTER.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.125
YOU CAME.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.709
I ALSO BROUGHT YOU
THESE.

21:41.709 --> 21:44.083
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY BEAT ME TO IT.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.917
OH, WELL...

21:45.917 --> 21:48.583
THAT NEW MOM IN MATERNITY

21:48.583 --> 21:51.500
DONATED THEM TO TERMINAL CARE.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.667
TALK ABOUT IRONY, HUH?

22:02.208 --> 22:04.291
YOU KNOW, DEXTER,

22:04.291 --> 22:10.500
MY WHOLE LIFE
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR...

22:10.500 --> 22:13.792
THE MEANING OF LIFE?

22:13.792 --> 22:16.709
THE PERFECT...

22:16.709 --> 22:21.166
KEY LIME PIE.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.709
AND WHAT DO I GET
WHEN I'M ABOUT TO CROAK?

22:23.709 --> 22:27.542
FUCKING PIE CRUST,
REDDI WIP,

22:27.542 --> 22:30.000
AND GREEN JELL-O.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.375
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO

22:31.375 --> 22:33.583
ABOUT FINDING YOU
THE PERFECT KEY LIME PIE.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.458
YOU'D BETTER DO IT FAST.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.542
NEXT THING TO GO
IS THE APPETITE.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.583
GENE ALWAYS HAD THIS THING

22:51.583 --> 22:54.000
ABOUT LIGHTING MY CIGARETTE.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.583
AND HE'D PASS IT TO ME...

22:58.750 --> 23:01.041
BEFORE HE LIT HIS OWN.

23:03.959 --> 23:06.417
SWEET, SWEET MAN.

23:14.542 --> 23:17.250
THEN IT ALL
CAUGHT UP TO HIM.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.625
I WATCHED HIM WITHER
TO A SKELETON.

23:20.625 --> 23:25.792
MY 6' TALL,
200-POUND HUSBAND,

23:25.792 --> 23:28.583
SHITTING ALL OVER
HIMSELF.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.375
HIS LAST BREATH
WAS A MERCY.

[coughing]

23:42.667 --> 23:44.667
[sighs]

23:44.667 --> 23:47.750
DYING I CAN DO.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.166
HELL, I'M DOING IT.

23:50.166 --> 23:53.834
THE PAIN SURE IS
A BEAR, THOUGH.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.500
HOW BAD?

23:55.500 --> 23:57.917
THE WORST PART
OF THE WHOLE DAMN THING...

23:57.917 --> 24:01.500
NOT LOSING MY LIFE...

24:01.500 --> 24:04.333
MY TIME ON THIS EARTH...

24:04.333 --> 24:08.041
IS LOSING MY...MY...

24:11.667 --> 24:14.375
[whispering]
DIGNITY.

24:30.834 --> 24:32.959
THAT FISH WAS GREAT.

24:32.959 --> 24:35.166
YOU DON'T THINK
MIGUEL OVERCOOKED IT?

24:35.166 --> 24:38.625
A BIT, BUT THE MANGO SALSA
SAVED THE DAY.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.625
THANK YOU.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.667
SO DO YOU LIKE
WHAT YOU DO?

24:42.667 --> 24:44.291
I MEAN, REAL ESTATE.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.667
I CAN'T IMAGINE
DOING ANYTHING ELSE.

24:48.458 --> 24:51.125
YEAH, I DECIDED
THAT LOSING MY JOB AT THE MOTEL

24:51.125 --> 24:53.458
IS NOT A BAD THING
BUT A GOOD THING.

24:53.458 --> 24:56.375
SO I'M LOOKING AROUND.

24:56.375 --> 24:57.792
WELL, WITH
YOUR PEOPLE SKILLS,

24:57.792 --> 25:00.333
YOU'D BE GREAT
AT REAL ESTATE.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.750
YOU THINK?

25:02.750 --> 25:05.917
HOW 'BOUT YOU START
WORK TOMORROW?

25:05.917 --> 25:07.875
[laughs]

25:07.875 --> 25:09.750
I'M...I'M SORRY, WHAT?

25:09.750 --> 25:12.542
I NEED AN ASSISTANT.

25:12.542 --> 25:16.291
HAVING SOMEONE I CAN TRUST
IS EVERYTHING.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.208
SALUD.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.250
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN GIVING
A LOT OF THOUGHT

25:29.250 --> 25:32.250
TO THIS CLEMSON GALT
THING.

25:32.250 --> 25:33.834
GOOD.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.458
DIGAME.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.125
WHAT IF WE WERE
TO TRAVEL UPSTATE

25:39.125 --> 25:40.875
AND ARRANGE
AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM?

25:40.875 --> 25:42.959
ABOUT?

25:42.959 --> 25:45.583
A CAREER CRIMINAL
WITH A RECORD LIKE HIS,

25:45.583 --> 25:47.291
HE'S GOTTA BE
AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF INTEL

25:47.291 --> 25:50.083
ON TONS OF OTHER CASES.

25:50.083 --> 25:53.041
WE WOULD JUST NEED
TO GET GALT ALONE LONG ENOUGH

25:53.041 --> 25:56.792
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
ANOTHER PRISONER DID THE DEED.

25:56.792 --> 25:58.375
LAST WEEK,
AN INMATE IS FOUND

25:58.375 --> 26:02.041
IN A PRISON HALLWAY
DROWNED IN A BUCKET OF WATER.

26:02.041 --> 26:05.750
THIS STUFF HAPPENS ALL DAY LONG
IN PLACES LIKE THAT.

26:07.542 --> 26:10.542
AN INMATE IS FOUND DEAD
IN CUSTODY, DEXTER,

26:10.542 --> 26:12.792
BE A LOT OF INQUIRIES
AND INVESTIGATIONS.

26:12.792 --> 26:15.208
YOU GOT THE BLEEDING HEARTS
COMIN' OUTTA THE WOODWORK

26:15.208 --> 26:16.875
WHINING ABOUT PRISON REFORM.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.750
HA. IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MUCH OF A PLAN.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.542
THAT IS THE PLAN...

26:24.542 --> 26:27.750
SO THAT MIGUEL FINALLY
INCLUDES HIMSELF OUT.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.417
BUT, UM...

26:29.417 --> 26:33.834
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING
A RACKETEERING CASE RIGHT NOW.

26:33.834 --> 26:35.542
MONEY LAUNDERING.

26:35.542 --> 26:38.792
THE ARYANS, THEY'RE MASTERS
AT MOVING CASH AROUND.

26:40.417 --> 26:44.834
[laughs]
I SUBPOENA GALT
AS AN EXPERT WITNESS,

26:44.834 --> 26:47.583
CORRECTIONS TRANSPORTS HIM
DOWN HERE TO TESTIFY.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.667
THEN GALT IS WITHIN
OUR REACH, HMM?

26:50.667 --> 26:53.875
AND ON MY TURF.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.750
GUESSING IT WOULD
TAKE A LONG TIME

26:55.750 --> 26:57.583
TO SET
SOMETHING LIKE THAT UP.

26:58.959 --> 27:01.458
IT WOULD.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.583
BUT I'VE ALREADY ISSUED
THE SUBPOENA.

27:03.583 --> 27:06.709
GALT'LL BE HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.875
ONLY...HE'S GONNA BE

27:08.875 --> 27:11.166
A NO-SHOW ON THE WITNESS STAND
THE NEXT MORNING.

27:11.166 --> 27:14.250
SWING BY THE COURTHOUSE
TOMORROW,

27:14.250 --> 27:16.834
I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH
ALL THE DETAILS.

27:19.458 --> 27:22.750
COÑO,  SAY THANK YOU,
DEXTER.

27:22.750 --> 27:24.834
MIGUEL SEEMS TO HAVE
WAY MORE APTITUDE

27:24.834 --> 27:28.834
AND APPETITE FOR THIS
THAN I EVER IMAGINED.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.667
[cell phone rings]

27:38.667 --> 27:40.667

JUST CALLING TO CHECK IN.

27:40.667 --> 27:42.875
JUST HAVING A LOOK-SEE
IN RAMON PRADO'S CAR.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.875
DEB, YOU REALLY NEED TO--
RELAX.

27:44.875 --> 27:47.250
HE'S SCARFING DOWN HIS SECOND
PLATE OF ARROZ CON POLLO

27:47.250 --> 27:48.875
AT A RESTAURANT UP THE BLOCK.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.375
HE'S GOT A WIFE AND KIDS
AT HOME, GOT THE NIGHT OFF,

27:51.375 --> 27:53.166
SO WHY IS HE EATING ALONE?

27:53.166 --> 27:54.917
WELL, MAYBE THE WIFE'S

27:54.917 --> 27:57.834
ARROZ CON POLLO
ISN'T POLLO ENOUGH.

27:57.834 --> 28:00.333
YOU FIND ANYTHING
INTERESTING?

28:00.333 --> 28:01.917
A SET OF GERMAN
STEEL FILET KNIVES,

28:01.917 --> 28:03.000
A COUPLE OF STRAIGHT RAZORS,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.917
AND LIKE 12 POUNDS
OF HUMAN SKIN.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.041
JUST BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE, WILL YOU?

28:07.041 --> 28:09.041
YES, SIR.

28:11.208 --> 28:13.166
DEB'S GOT HER MISSION.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.500
I'VE GOT MINE.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.917
HEY, I CAN GET OUT

28:36.917 --> 28:38.375
AND GIVE YOU A GREAT, BIG HUG

28:38.375 --> 28:39.917
SO EVERYONE CAN SEE
WHAT GOOD FRIENDS WE ARE...

28:39.917 --> 28:41.959
OR YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

28:41.959 --> 28:45.458
YOU KNOW, AFTER 12 HOURS
ON SURVEILLANCE DETAIL,

28:45.458 --> 28:47.709
HOW 'BOUT YOU BLOW ME
INSTEAD?

28:47.709 --> 28:49.542
I'VE BEEN GIVEN
THE DIRECTIVE TO EITHER

28:49.542 --> 28:51.959
STEP UP MY INVESTIGATION
OF QUINN OR CLOSE IT.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.875
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND DICK.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.333
IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH
A FUCKWAD,

28:55.333 --> 28:57.250
I'D ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR YOU
FOR WORKING FOR I.A.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.959
WHERE CAREERS GO TO DIE.

28:58.959 --> 29:00.166
YOU NEED TO GET
NEXT TO QUINN,

29:00.166 --> 29:01.709
BE HIS GO-TO GIRL.

29:01.709 --> 29:03.834
YOU'LL BE WEARING A WIRE.

29:05.959 --> 29:07.166
ARE YOU ON CRACK?

29:07.166 --> 29:08.834
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
I TOLD YOU TO EAT SHIT?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.041
WHAT THE FUCK MAKES YOU THINK

29:10.041 --> 29:11.750
I'M SUDDENLY WILLING
TO PLAY NOW?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.959
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL PUT THE WORD OUT

29:13.959 --> 29:16.959
THAT YOU'VE BEEN COOPERATING
ALL ALONG.

29:16.959 --> 29:19.709
EVERYONE'LL THINK
YOU'RE A RAT ANYWAY.

29:21.875 --> 29:24.709
HARD TO BELIEVE EVEN YOU
WOULD SINK THAT LOW.

29:33.166 --> 29:35.667
SO THAT DOOR
RIGHT OVER THERE?
HMM.

29:35.667 --> 29:37.000
CHECK THIS OUT.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.834
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE KEPT LOCKED,

29:38.834 --> 29:40.875
AND IT NEVER IS.

29:40.875 --> 29:43.834
THE SMOKERS USE IT
AS A SHORTCUT TO GET OUTSIDE.

29:43.834 --> 29:46.166
SHORTCUT
TO A SHORTER LIFE.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.834
YOU KNOW, STATISTICALLY,

29:47.834 --> 29:49.834
MOST ESCAPES HAPPEN
OUT OF A COURTHOUSE.

29:49.834 --> 29:52.166
THE SECURITY'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE LAX,

29:52.166 --> 29:54.291
THE DEFENDANT IS WEARING
A SUIT AND A TIE.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.667
IT MAKES IT EASY FOR HIM
TO JUST WALK AWAY.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.250
EASIER FOR US
TO COVER OUR TRACKS.

29:59.250 --> 30:01.000
THAT TOO.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.458
SEÑOR, ¿CUANTO PARA...?

30:04.458 --> 30:06.000
NO, NO, POR FAVOR.
¿ESTA SEGURO?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.250
SI, SEÑOR.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.125
MUST BE GOOD
TO BE YOU.

30:09.125 --> 30:11.125
SOMETIMES.

30:11.125 --> 30:13.125

30:13.125 --> 30:14.458
THANKS FOR HELPING OUT.

30:14.458 --> 30:18.000
[indistinct conversation]

30:24.959 --> 30:27.625
REAL REASON
SHE'S BLINDFOLDED--

30:27.625 --> 30:29.750
SO SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WATCH
EVERYTHING SHE STANDS FOR

30:29.750 --> 30:32.000
GET PISSED ON
BY SOMEONE LIKE ELLEN WOLF.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.458
YOU KNOW,

30:33.458 --> 30:34.875
SHE HAD THIS CLIENT ONCE

30:34.875 --> 30:37.000
WHO THREW A FIVE-YEAR-OLD
INTO AN INDUSTRIAL WASHER

30:37.000 --> 30:38.125
FOR TALKING DIRTY.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.917
SHE GOT HIM OFF WITH SIX MONTHS
IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL.

30:40.917 --> 30:42.083
DIMINISHED FUCKING CAPACITY.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.291
HEY.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.709
SHE PROBABLY
GOT PAID MORE THAT

30:46.709 --> 30:48.083
THAN YOU TOOK HOME
IN A YEAR.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.500
AND I GOTTA TELL YOU,

30:49.500 --> 30:51.667
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
WITH YOUR BOSS OVER THERE.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.083
I NEVER THOUGHT

30:53.083 --> 30:55.291
THAT SHE, OF ALL PEOPLE,
WOULD HURT ME LIKE THIS

30:55.291 --> 30:57.291
AND THROW IN WITH THESE
FUCKING BOTTOM-FEEDERS.

30:57.291 --> 30:58.667
MY DAD USED TO SAY

30:58.667 --> 31:00.709
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU THINK
YOU KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE.

31:00.709 --> 31:02.959
YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.500
SMART MAN.

31:07.333 --> 31:10.083
WELL, SOMETIMES.

31:10.083 --> 31:11.041

31:12.667 --> 31:14.750

31:14.750 --> 31:16.500

31:17.875 --> 31:20.417
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
TELLING THE TRUTH.

31:20.417 --> 31:22.709
WE'VE GOT, UH, MORE
THAN ENOUGH

31:22.709 --> 31:25.041
TO GET THE HINES CONVICTION
SET ASIDE.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.542
AND YOU'VE SET THE STAGE

31:26.542 --> 31:28.709
FOR YOUR SMEAR CAMPAIGN
AGAINST A STAND-UP GUY.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.625
NICE.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.250
YOU KNOW,
YOU EVER WANNA HEAR

31:32.250 --> 31:34.500
THE UNEXPURGATED VERSION
OF YOUR GUY,

31:34.500 --> 31:35.667
COME FIND ME, OKAY?

31:47.083 --> 31:48.291

31:48.291 --> 31:49.667

IS THROUGH THAT DOOR.

TO A PARKING GARAGE.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.875
ON YOUR RIGHT,

31:59.875 --> 32:01.875
THERE'S GONNA BE
AN EMERGENCY EXIT.

32:01.875 --> 32:04.166
AND THAT DEADBOLT
IS GONNA BE TAPED...

FREEDOM.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.625

32:14.625 --> 32:17.709
YOU DIDN'T WALK AWAY
FROM ETHAN TURNER.

35:02.333 --> 35:03.750
WELL, IT'S NOT.

35:03.750 --> 35:06.333
PARDON MY BLUNTNESS, BUT...

35:06.333 --> 35:07.834
THIS PIE IS GREEN.

35:07.834 --> 35:10.375
MEANS THEY USED
FOOD COLORING.

35:10.375 --> 35:13.250
SOMETHING PURISTS
FROWN ON?

35:13.250 --> 35:14.583
WHICH I'D BE DOING
RIGHT NOW,

35:14.583 --> 35:16.750
EXCEPT EVEN MY FACE HURTS.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.333
THE OTHER THING
THEY FUCKED UP--

35:19.333 --> 35:22.375
THIS WASN'T MADE
WITH CONDENSED MILK.

35:22.375 --> 35:25.083
NO, IT'S FRESH
AND ORGANIC.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.542
ONLY THEY DIDN'T HAVE
FRESH MILK IN THE KEYS

35:27.542 --> 35:30.417
BACK IN THE DAY.

35:30.417 --> 35:31.750
OH.

35:33.375 --> 35:36.875
HERE COMES
MISS MORPHY.

35:36.875 --> 35:39.625
BRINGER OF BAD DREAMS
AND LESS PAIN.

35:39.625 --> 35:42.375
DEXTER...

35:42.375 --> 35:47.333
[whispering]
IF YOU'RE AS SERIOUS
ABOUT KEY LIME PIE AS I AM...

35:50.417 --> 35:53.250
YOU CAN DO BETTER.

35:57.083 --> 36:00.375
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
BUT IT FEELS DIFFERENT.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.959
I WON'T BE ALONE.

36:01.959 --> 36:06.375
UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR ME...
NOT WITHOUT RISK.

36:06.375 --> 36:08.458
AND STRANGELY EXHILARATING.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.041
(Rita)
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK?

36:11.542 --> 36:13.625
BEST PIZZA NIGHT EVER.

36:15.125 --> 36:17.834
NO, I MEANT ABOUT
SYL'S JOB OFFER.

36:17.834 --> 36:20.667
IF REAL ESTATE'S
SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN,

36:20.667 --> 36:22.667
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.291
AND SYL'S GREAT
AT WHAT SHE DOES.

36:24.291 --> 36:27.166
IN A MARKET THIS BAD,
SHE'S STILL ALWAYS CLOSING.

36:27.166 --> 36:30.417
AND I COULD LEARN A LOT.
I JUST...

36:30.417 --> 36:31.375
BUT...

36:34.417 --> 36:37.166
WELL, WHAT IF I...

36:37.166 --> 36:38.750
SEE A SIDE TO HER
THAT I DON'T LIKE?

36:38.750 --> 36:40.625
I GUESS THAT'S
THE RISK YOU RUN

36:40.625 --> 36:42.375
WHEN YOU GO INTO BUSINESS
WITH SOMEBODY,

36:42.375 --> 36:44.375
ESPECIALLY A FRIEND.

36:44.375 --> 36:48.166
MAKES THINGS MORE COMPLICATED,
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.083
STILL...

36:50.083 --> 36:51.041
WITHOUT MY FRIEND SYL,

36:51.041 --> 36:53.542
I WOULDN'T
HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.792
SO I THINK I'M GONNA

36:55.792 --> 36:58.208
TAKE THE RISK
AND JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET

36:58.208 --> 37:01.709
AND SEE IF THIS NEW THING
CALLS TO ME.

37:06.125 --> 37:07.917
IT'S GETTING LATE.

37:07.917 --> 37:09.709
YOU DON'T WANNA STAY?

37:09.709 --> 37:13.291
MIGUEL AND I HAVE A...
EARLY MORNING RUN.

37:13.291 --> 37:15.709
I CAN SLEEP IN LONGER
IF I STAY AT MY PLACE.

37:15.709 --> 37:18.917
DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE'S A NO-SHOW.

37:18.917 --> 37:21.041
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

37:21.041 --> 37:23.959
HE'S BEEN A COMPLETE
WRECK LATELY.

37:23.959 --> 37:25.500
NOT SLEEPING,
TERRIBLE MOOD.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.834
I MEAN, SYL THINKS SOMETHING'S
REALLY BOTHERING HIM.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.500
I SAW HIM TODAY.
HE SEEMED FINE.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.291
WELL, YOU MAY BE HIS BUDDY,
BUT YOU'RE NOT HIS WIFE.

37:33.291 --> 37:35.083
AND BESIDES,

37:35.083 --> 37:37.709
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN HIDE
ANYTHING FROM YOUR PARTNER.

37:37.709 --> 37:39.709
SO TRUE.

37:39.709 --> 37:42.250
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO?

37:44.917 --> 37:47.583
LOOKS LIKE MIGUEL'S
GOT A BAD CASE OF NERVES

37:47.583 --> 37:49.542
ABOUT TONIGHT.

37:49.542 --> 37:51.500
HE ISN'T SLEEPING
LIKE A BABY ANYMORE.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.500
(Harry)
IF YOU'RE GONNA
BAIL OF OF THIS,

37:53.500 --> 37:55.709
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME.

37:55.709 --> 37:59.166
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DRESSED LIKE THAT FOR?

37:59.166 --> 38:00.625
I FIGURED
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

38:00.625 --> 38:03.041
WHY DON'T WE SWING BY

38:03.041 --> 38:05.125
AND PICK UP RITA
AND THE KIDS?

38:06.834 --> 38:09.458
BRING THEM ALONG TOO.

38:10.792 --> 38:14.000
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU CAN COUNT ON MIGUEL?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.375
HE'S JUST A LITTLE JUMPY.
HE'S NEW AT THIS.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.959
MARK MY WORDS, DEX,
HE'LL GIVE YOU UP IN A HEARTBEAT

38:18.959 --> 38:20.458
TO SAVE HIS OWN ASS.

38:20.458 --> 38:22.333
THIS IS NOT A GUY

38:22.333 --> 38:24.834
WHO WANTS TO SPEND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE IN A CAGE.

38:24.834 --> 38:28.083
JUST ONE MORE THING MIGUEL
AND I HAVE IN COMMON.

38:28.083 --> 38:30.250
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

38:30.250 --> 38:33.500
YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO RELY
ON ANYONE ELSE BEFORE, DEXTER.

38:33.500 --> 38:37.291
BECAUSE YOU TAUGHT ME
LONELINESS AS AN ART FORM.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.542
BUT GUESS WHAT?

38:39.542 --> 38:41.500
I FINALLY HAVE A LIFE

38:41.500 --> 38:44.166
WITH A FAMILY
AND NOW A FRIEND...

38:44.166 --> 38:47.208
WHO I TRUST.

38:47.208 --> 38:49.792
WE ONLY SEE
TWO THINGS IN PEOPLE...

38:49.792 --> 38:53.458
WHAT WE WANNA SEE
AND WHAT THEY WANNA SHOW US.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.500
YOU DON'T KNOW MIGUEL
ANY MORE THAN HE KNOWS YOU.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.333
YOU AREN'T SERIOUSLY GONNA
LECTURE ME ON RELATIONSHIPS

38:58.333 --> 39:01.333
AFTER THE DEBRIS FIELD
YOU LEFT BEHIND.

39:03.917 --> 39:05.917
NO MATTER HOW CLOSE
TWO PEOPLE ARE,

39:05.917 --> 39:08.875
AN INFINITE DISTANCE
SEPARATES THEM.

39:10.917 --> 39:12.875
LOOK AT YOU AND ME.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.583
MIND IF I GET
A PICTURE WITH YOU, JEFE?

39:23.583 --> 39:24.792
YOU GOT A CAM--OH.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.542
OH, YEAH.

39:28.709 --> 39:30.542
(Miguel)
NO PROBLEMA.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.000
GRACIAS.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.083
ANY TRUTH YOU'RE GONNA
RUN FOR D.A.?

39:41.083 --> 39:44.375
UH...IF I DO, I'M GONNA
NEED YOUR SUPPORT.

39:44.375 --> 39:46.083
YOU GOT IT, JEFE.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.500
THANKS, OFFICER.

40:03.125 --> 40:05.291
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
PULLED PORK.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.208
I GOT NO CLUE WHY THE FUCK
YOU DRAGGED ME DOWN HERE

40:08.208 --> 40:10.417
IN ALL THIS HUMIDITY,
BUT YOU CAN SUCK MY WHITE DICK,

40:10.417 --> 40:12.375
YOU THINK I'M HELPING
YOUR SPIC ASS WITH SHIT.

40:16.417 --> 40:20.208
THIS ALL ENDS RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW, CLEMSON.

40:21.959 --> 40:23.417
THIS MAKES US EVEN.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.250
WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR,

40:36.250 --> 40:37.709
ONE OF YOUR NAZI PALS
IS WAITING FOR YOU

40:37.709 --> 40:38.917
IN THE PARKING GARAGE.

40:38.917 --> 40:41.250
FROM NOW ON,

40:41.250 --> 40:43.750
ALL OF THE THREATS
TO MY FAMILY,

40:43.750 --> 40:45.625
THEY STOP, UNDERSTAND?

40:56.583 --> 40:59.375
I KNEW MY ARYAN BROTHERS
WOULD COME THROUGH, ESE.

41:10.542 --> 41:11.500
[door clangs shut]

41:14.625 --> 41:16.500
THANKS.
MM-HMM.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.500
HEY, HAVE ANY
ARRANGEMENTS BEEN MADE

41:18.500 --> 41:20.333
IN CASE THIS GUY'S
TESTIMONY RUNS A LITTLE LONG

41:20.333 --> 41:21.917
AND HE HAS TO STAY
ANOTHER DAY?

41:21.917 --> 41:23.709
WE'RE HOLDING A SPOT
FOR HIM IN PROTECTIVE

41:23.709 --> 41:24.709
AT MIAMI-DADE.

41:24.709 --> 41:26.667
MY GOOD MAN.
APPRECIATE IT.

41:30.208 --> 41:31.625
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

41:31.625 --> 41:34.792
I GOT A WITNESS IN THERE, MAN,
THAT'S TAKING A NAP.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.667
I'M GONNA REALLY NEED HIM FRESH
FOR COURT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.125
I GOTTA PUT A COUNTY
WRISTBAND ON HIM.

41:39.125 --> 41:40.583
JUST TAKE A SECOND.
YEA--

41:51.917 --> 41:53.709
CLEM GALT.

41:55.542 --> 41:57.750
I'M YOUR WHEEL MAN.

41:57.750 --> 41:59.667
WELCOME HOME.

41:59.667 --> 42:03.125
HEIL HITLER.

42:03.125 --> 42:05.166
LET'S GET

RIDE'S THIS WAY.

42:05.166 --> 42:07.291

42:07.291 --> 42:08.667
[alarm blares]
(Galt)

42:08.667 --> 42:09.917
SHIT! WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

42:09.917 --> 42:11.667
(Dexter)
I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.000
I'LL GET YA OUTTA HERE.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.500
WE JUST GOTTA
GET TO THE CAR.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.083
GALT HAD TO HAVE
AN ACCOMPLICE.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.750
JUST SET UP A PERIMETER

42:22.750 --> 42:23.834
AROUND THIS BUILDING
RIGHT AWAY.

42:23.834 --> 42:24.834
NO ONE SHOULD GET IN
OR OUT.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.792
FUCKIN' SPIC SET US UP.

42:26.792 --> 42:28.667
THIS GUY CANNOT GET AWAY!

42:28.667 --> 42:29.709
(Galt)
AND I'M GONNA
RETURN THE FAVOR.

42:29.709 --> 42:32.333
(Dexter)
THAT'S MIGHTY WHITE OF YOU.
[groans]

42:39.542 --> 42:41.542
(Harry)
GALT'S RIGHT.
HE'S SELLING YOU OUT.

42:41.542 --> 42:45.375
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE CAPACITY OF OTHER PEOPLE

42:45.375 --> 42:46.709
TO LET YOU DOWN.

42:46.709 --> 42:48.333
IT'S NOT THE TIME, DAD.

42:52.750 --> 42:54.542
(Harry)
THERE HE GOES.

42:54.542 --> 42:56.792
LOOKING OUT FOR NUMBER ONE.

42:56.792 --> 42:59.667
WHICH IS WHAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE.

43:05.458 --> 43:06.875
LIKE THE MAN SAID,

43:06.875 --> 43:09.458
NOBODY GETS IN OR OUT.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.834
MIGHT AS WELL GIVE UP.

43:16.834 --> 43:18.583
NO SENSE
RISKING DEATH BY COP.

43:18.583 --> 43:19.959
YOU KEEP MIGUEL'S
INVOLVEMENT SECRET,

43:19.959 --> 43:21.917
HE MIGHT LET YOU OFF
WITH A FEW YEARS.

43:21.917 --> 43:23.375
STOP.

43:23.375 --> 43:24.834
UNLESS THEY FIND
THOSE BLOOD SLIDES

43:24.834 --> 43:26.041
WHEN THEY TOSS
YOUR APARTMENT.

43:26.041 --> 43:27.792
STOP!
[brakes screech]

43:29.834 --> 43:31.583
HOLA, AMIGO.

43:48.875 --> 43:51.291
I'M GONNA DROP YOU OFF
AT YOUR CAR.

43:51.291 --> 43:53.500
THEN I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE STASH HOUSE

43:53.500 --> 43:55.417
AS SOON AS I CAN
GET OUTTA HERE.

43:57.458 --> 43:59.208
WAIT FOR ME, HUH?
THANKS FOR THIS.

43:59.208 --> 44:01.417
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

44:03.458 --> 44:05.625
HEY, I'M GONNA DO
A LOOP AROUND THE BUILDING

44:05.625 --> 44:07.333
UNTIL YOU GET MORE
BACKUP HERE, OKAY?

44:07.333 --> 44:08.583
YOU GOT IT, JEFE.

44:21.458 --> 44:23.625
GIMME A FUCKING
BREAK, RAMON.

44:23.625 --> 44:25.667
[argui]

44:25.667 --> 44:26.834
DON'T FUCKING
LIE TO ME--

44:26.834 --> 44:27.834
AAH!

44:47.667 --> 44:50.333
YOU CAN MAKE THIS STOP
RIGHT NOW...

44:50.333 --> 44:51.917
IF YOU TELL ME
WHERE HE IS.

44:51.917 --> 44:54.041
I DON'T KNOW.

44:57.333 --> 44:59.834
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
VERY HARD ON YOURSELF, FELIPE.

45:05.834 --> 45:06.875
[creak]
[gasps]

45:06.875 --> 45:07.917
WHOA!

45:07.917 --> 45:09.834
YOU SCARED THE
FUCKMOTHER OUT OF ME.

45:09.834 --> 45:11.125
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT CALLED ME.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.834
WHAT DO WE GOT?

45:13.834 --> 45:15.250
KIDNAPPING, FOR STARTERS.

45:15.250 --> 45:17.250
WHO'S THE SPECIAL
GUEST?

45:17.250 --> 45:18.709
THAT'S FELIPE CEPEDA.

45:18.709 --> 45:20.458
HE'S ONE OF FREEBO'S
HEMP SUPPLIERS.

45:20.458 --> 45:22.041
I QUESTIONED HIM
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

45:22.041 --> 45:25.083
NOW RAMON'S GOT A FEW
QUESTIONS OF HIS OWN.

45:25.083 --> 45:26.959
WELL, SO FAR,
I'VE ONLY HEARD ONE--

45:26.959 --> 45:28.208
WHERE'S FREEBO?

45:28.208 --> 45:30.542
I'M JUST WAITING
FOR THE SKINNING TO START.

45:31.875 --> 45:33.041
(Ramon)
OYE.

45:33.041 --> 45:34.959
TELL ME WHERE HE IS.

45:34.959 --> 45:35.959
I DON'T KNOW!

45:35.959 --> 45:37.709
OKAY.

45:39.375 --> 45:40.750
OKAY.

45:43.959 --> 45:45.125
[can top pops]

45:45.125 --> 45:47.917
NOTHING LIKE A NICE COLD
SODA POP BEFORE A GOOD SKINNING.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.250
AAH!

45:54.250 --> 45:55.959

45:55.959 --> 45:57.458
WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT?

45:57.458 --> 45:59.417
WE NEED TO BE SURE
HE'S THE SKINNER.

[Felipe screaming]

46:02.959 --> 46:05.959
[coughing]

46:05.959 --> 46:06.959

46:15.000 --> 46:16.083
[Felipe screaming]

46:16.083 --> 46:17.417
I DON'T GET IT.
I DON'T GET IT.

46:17.417 --> 46:18.959
THAT'S NOT
THE SKINNER'S M.O.

46:18.959 --> 46:20.208
MAYBE HE'S JUST
WARMING UP.

46:20.208 --> 46:23.458
[coughing]

46:26.834 --> 46:28.291
HERE HE GOES...

46:37.875 --> 46:39.000

46:44.125 --> 46:45.583
HE'S NOT THE SKINNER.

47:00.041 --> 47:01.667
[cell phone rings]

47:05.125 --> 47:07.625
[ringing]

47:07.625 --> 47:10.291

DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

47:10.291 --> 47:12.417
[cheerfully]
HELLO.

47:12.417 --> 47:14.709
SO RAMON PRADO'S A SICK FUCK,

47:14.709 --> 47:17.250
BUT HE'S NOT
THE SICK FUCK WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

47:17.250 --> 47:19.333
I'LL TALK TO YOU
ABOUT IT OVER BREAKFAST.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.041
I GOTTA GO.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.041
WHAT'S UP?

47:24.500 --> 47:28.083
SO, WHY ARE YOU CALLING US
IN AT MIDNIGHT?

47:28.083 --> 47:29.834
WE'VE PICKED UP
RAMON PRADO.

47:29.834 --> 47:32.000
HE'S, UH...OUTSIDE.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.041
WE GOT A UNI WATCHING HIM
TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

47:37.041 --> 47:38.667
FOR WHAT?

47:38.667 --> 47:40.500
KIDNAPPING.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.709
FALSE IMPRISONMENT.

47:41.709 --> 47:44.041
AND TORTURE.

48:26.709 --> 48:28.625
YES, I WAS.

48:28.625 --> 48:30.041

48:30.041 --> 48:33.417

49:53.208 --> 49:54.417
[groans]

50:01.208 --> 50:02.667
(Dexter)
EVEN IN PRISON,

50:02.667 --> 50:04.250
I'M SURE YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE BIG SLUMP

50:04.250 --> 50:06.125
IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET.

50:09.458 --> 50:11.709
WHAT THE FUCK...

50:13.250 --> 50:15.041
[grunts]

50:15.041 --> 50:16.083

TO THE DOWNTURN, THOUGH.

50:19.250 --> 50:22.041
PLENTY OF EMPTY HOUSES.

50:25.250 --> 50:28.250

50:28.250 --> 50:30.625
IT'S WHERE YOU KILLED
JENNA KENDRICK.

50:30.625 --> 50:33.000
I GOT NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.792
I'M TALKING ABOUT
HAMMER TIME, CLEMSON.

50:38.250 --> 50:40.000
NO.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.041
YOU GOT ME MIXED UP
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

50:43.041 --> 50:45.083
[gagging]

50:53.000 --> 50:54.041
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE

50:54.041 --> 50:56.250
HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

50:58.417 --> 51:01.208
AND NONE OF IT
WOULD BE HAPPENING

51:01.208 --> 51:05.291
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY...FRIEND

51:05.291 --> 51:07.041
MIGUEL PRADO.

51:07.041 --> 51:08.583
YOU REMEMBER HIM?

51:08.583 --> 51:10.583
HE REALLY CAME THROUGH
TONIGHT.

51:10.583 --> 51:13.250
IN A BIG WAY.

51:16.542 --> 51:19.333
I NEVER HAD A PARTNER BEFORE.

51:19.333 --> 51:21.375
I HAD MY DOUBTS INITIALLY,

51:21.375 --> 51:23.041
BUT EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.

51:24.625 --> 51:27.917
BUT THIS PART, THE RITUAL...

51:27.917 --> 51:30.667
THE CONNECTION AND CERTAINTY...

51:30.667 --> 51:35.375
FOLLOWED BY THAT
PRISTINE SILENCE...

51:35.375 --> 51:38.041
IS FOR ME.

51:41.875 --> 51:43.875
AND ME ALONE.
[muffled cry]

52:00.083 --> 52:02.250
MIGUEL WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.

52:03.917 --> 52:06.917
I'LL EXPLAIN TO HIM I TOOK GALT
STRAIGHT TO THE CEMETERY

52:06.917 --> 52:08.417
AND DUMPED HIM IN A GRAVE

52:08.417 --> 52:11.125
AFTER THE SCREW-UP
AT THE COURTHOUSE.

52:11.125 --> 52:13.959
TRUTH IS, I'M NOT
READY TO SHARE THIS PART OF ME

52:13.959 --> 52:15.750
WITH ANYONE ELSE JUST YET.

52:17.709 --> 52:20.333
PRESENT COMPANY EXCEPTED.

52:21.667 --> 52:24.125
I'M NOT SURE
I EVER WILL BE READY.

52:30.041 --> 52:32.125
EVEN IF MIGUEL
SENSES MY DECEPTION,

52:32.125 --> 52:36.125
HE'LL FORGIVE ME
THIS ONE SMALL UNTRUTH.

52:36.125 --> 52:37.166
DEXTER.

52:42.375 --> 52:44.583
HOW CAN I BE SO SURE?

52:49.834 --> 52:53.375
BECAUSE AFTER TONIGHT,
I CAN HONESTLY SAY

52:53.375 --> 52:57.709
I KNOW WHO MIGUEL PRADO
REALLY IS...

52:57.709 --> 53:02.291
MY FIRST GOOD FRIEND.

53:02.291 --> 53:05.542
AND THOSE ARE IN SHORT
SUPPLY THESE DAYS.
