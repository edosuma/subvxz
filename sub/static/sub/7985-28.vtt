All right.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.756
As far as the minis
are concerned,

09:16.756 --> 09:18.725
I have something
very important to say.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.296
The mini group
was a hot mess.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.399
<i>Maybe you won the category,</i>

09:26.399 --> 09:28.368
but guess what?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.670
There weren't any
other mini groups.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.272
You were competing
against yourself,

09:32.272 --> 09:33.540
and they gave
it to you.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.375
Had there been tons
of mini groups there,

09:35.375 --> 09:37.010
you would
not have won.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.578
TIFFANIE:
Do you think it was the timing,

09:38.578 --> 09:40.113
or what do you think was...

09:40.113 --> 09:41.181
Their musicality!

09:41.181 --> 09:42.282
Their timing.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.451
Their ability to work
together as a group.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.953
Their peripheral vision.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.354
Feeding off each other.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.990
Knowing their counts
in "A Contagion."

09:50.990 --> 09:53.293
Should I keep going?

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
This week,

09:55.295 --> 09:57.097
you are not competing.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.164
What?

09:58.164 --> 09:59.265
NIA:
Whoa.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.701
Ooh.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.536
No way.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.539
Welcome back, Abby.
(cheering)

10:07.740 --> 10:08.908
Yay.
Abby's back!

10:10.343 --> 10:11.911
ASHLEE: <i>I totally understand</i>
<i>that the mini team</i>

10:11.911 --> 10:14.647
would be frustrated and angry

10:14.647 --> 10:16.015
that they're not dancing
this week.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.917
<i>I would be pissed, too,</i>

10:17.917 --> 10:19.085
<i>but our girls have had</i>
<i>a tough season</i>

10:19.085 --> 10:21.354
<i>because the mini team's</i>
<i>been here,</i>

10:21.354 --> 10:23.323
so it's nice that our girls
are gonna get a week

10:23.323 --> 10:24.824
with Abby's full attention.

10:24.824 --> 10:26.893
ABBY LEE:
Since the group
was a hot mess,

10:26.893 --> 10:29.095
they need to learn steps

10:29.095 --> 10:31.631
that they can all
do well together.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.366
So I'm gonna bring in
an old friend tomorrow.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.935
He's gonna put these kids
through the paces.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.238
Chop, chop. Get to
where you need to be.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.906
Let's go.
But, Abby,

10:39.906 --> 10:43.076
they also need to know how
to work together on that stage.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.677
Not just in the studio...
JILL:
That's what you're gonna

10:44.677 --> 10:46.312
...but on the stage.
...do this week over there.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.781
She can go right out here right
now and do a standing back tuck.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.350
She can do whips.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.519
She can do all these things.
This is not your
own conversation.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.953
This is not
about your child.
It's... No.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.755
It's about you guys as a team.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.323
We want to work
with you. They don't.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.126
Please, wait until
we're done! Go!

11:00.126 --> 11:01.528
Get out!
Oh, it's not...
We're not...

11:01.528 --> 11:02.695
Please leave.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.564
Go.
JILL:
Do what Abby said

11:04.564 --> 11:06.132
and get out!

11:10.370 --> 11:12.071
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

11:12.071 --> 11:15.875
You used these kids
to put you where you are now!

11:15.875 --> 11:17.777
You're nobody,
and you're nothing.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.412
You were nobody, too!

11:19.412 --> 11:22.048
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the stage
"Mind Craft."

11:31.491 --> 11:32.725
ABBY LEE:
<i>The name</i>

11:32.725 --> 11:34.160
is "Mind Craft,"

11:34.160 --> 11:36.129
<i>a play on the video game.</i>

11:36.129 --> 11:39.866
It's survival in the earliest
days with the most simple

11:39.866 --> 11:41.734
<i>things, all right?</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

11:44.137 --> 11:45.738
You're soldiers
going into battle.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.340
You want that
first‐place trophy.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.410
(videogame music playing)

12:00.019 --> 12:01.521
ABBY LEE:
<i>No, it's...</i>

12:01.521 --> 12:03.590
She's doing the other feet.
And where do you

12:03.590 --> 12:05.592
look when you do
the right heel lifted?

12:05.592 --> 12:06.826
You're looking back.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.728
Look back,
but be strong. Boom.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.430
And then switch it,
and you're on the left foot.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.598
But don't sickle it.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.066
Just get up in your big toe.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.968
So fix that.
HOLLY:
<i>Here's a great</i>

12:14.968 --> 12:16.836
platform because the kids

12:16.836 --> 12:18.705
<i>get it.</i>
ASHLEE:
<i>Minecraft is current.</i>

12:18.705 --> 12:20.139
JILL:
Yeah.
Everything else we've done

12:20.139 --> 12:21.874
has been before their time.
Like, everything.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.076
And they're
excited about it.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.310
ASHLEE:
They were excited.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.979
Which could lead
them to perform

12:25.979 --> 12:28.281
the way they performed
that improv number.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.515
<i>We finally have</i>

12:29.515 --> 12:31.417
Abby's time
and Abby's attention,

12:31.417 --> 12:34.053
<i>but this choreography is</i>
<i>insanely challenging.</i>

12:34.053 --> 12:35.288
<i>The music is weird.</i>

12:35.288 --> 12:38.958
<i>You know,</i>
<i>we've got timing issues,</i>

12:38.958 --> 12:40.927
<i>but because Abby</i>
<i>is completely focused</i>

12:40.927 --> 12:43.329
<i>on us this week,</i>
<i>we need to win.</i>

12:43.329 --> 12:44.731
ABBY LEE:
<i>So, listen,</i>

12:44.731 --> 12:47.634
I think this is great,
It looks amazing,

12:47.634 --> 12:50.036
<i>but I'm worried</i>
<i>that it's fast and it's tight.</i>

12:50.036 --> 12:52.639
You need to work on this before
we see you tomorrow, all right?

12:52.639 --> 12:54.207
<i>Good work.</i>
<i>Thank you, Gianna.</i>

12:54.207 --> 12:55.575
And out you go.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.377
BRYNN: <i>I'm really excited</i>
<i>about the "Mine Craft"</i>

12:57.377 --> 12:58.645
<i>group dance,</i>
<i>and the choreography's</i>

12:58.645 --> 12:59.946
<i>really good so far,</i>

12:59.946 --> 13:02.315
but it's only been 30 seconds
of the music,

13:02.315 --> 13:03.783
so we're a little worried,

13:03.783 --> 13:06.452
<i>because rehearsal time's over,</i>

13:06.452 --> 13:08.588
<i>and we just started</i>
<i>learning it.</i>

13:08.588 --> 13:10.356
But, you know, it's...

13:10.356 --> 13:13.026
It'll be different,
and it'll be cool, I think.

13:13.026 --> 13:16.062
Okay, Kendall!

13:16.062 --> 13:18.131
All right, so this
is "Cold and clear."

13:18.131 --> 13:21.034
It's about Neptune,
the god of the sea.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.969
It is contemporary.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.271
Thank you.
Okay.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.407
<i>These are the first solos</i>
<i>of the season,</i>

13:27.407 --> 13:29.475
<i>so there's a lot</i>
<i>of pressure on Kendall.</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:30.977
Kendall is doing

13:30.977 --> 13:32.912
<i>our most difficult routine.</i>

13:32.912 --> 13:35.248
<i>It's a Kalani type of solo.</i>

13:35.248 --> 13:37.784
<i>It is a gorgeous</i>
<i>contemporary piece.</i>

13:37.784 --> 13:40.620
<i>I just hope Kendall lives up</i>
<i>to my expectations.</i>

13:40.620 --> 13:43.189
What feels better?
This way, or this way?

13:43.189 --> 13:45.291
(Kendall mumbles)
Okay. All right. That's fine.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.460
So straighten your legs.
Straighten your legs.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.895
GIANNA:
Be more to me.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.330
That's pretty, though.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.632
<i>Let's see if it's still just</i>
<i>ocean, or if we hear words</i>

13:52.632 --> 13:54.367
<i>then. What does it say?</i>

13:54.367 --> 13:56.836
What is the first lyric?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.404
Hold me in the dark.
Every time.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.573
Tide.
Oh...

14:00.573 --> 14:02.642
Hold me in the...
It's about the water.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.344
Ooh, that's her music.
It sounds pretty.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.079
HOLLY: That's cool.
Yeah, sounds good.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.081
(soft, orchestral intro)

14:10.083 --> 14:13.252
HOLLY: <i>Abby's gonna pull out</i>
<i>all the stops</i>

14:13.252 --> 14:14.253
for you, Jill.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.655
When has Abby ever

14:15.655 --> 14:16.856
<i>given Nia or Kendall a solo</i>

14:16.856 --> 14:18.057
<i>that has everything you want?</i>

14:18.057 --> 14:20.960
Great music,
it's contemporary.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.729
But what do you think
her reasoning behind that is?

14:22.729 --> 14:25.031
Because she wants to keep you
on her good side.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.734
ASHLEE:
<i>She's gonna make this good,</i>
<i>she's gonna set her up</i>

14:27.734 --> 14:29.268
to win, she's gonna
set her up to beat

14:29.268 --> 14:31.504
Kalani to see if she can
get you back on board.

14:31.504 --> 14:35.808
JILL: <i>It would take a whole lot</i>
<i>for me to forgive and forget</i>

14:35.808 --> 14:38.177
how Abby mishandled
Kendall's music,

14:38.177 --> 14:41.814
<i>but this week, Abby gives her</i>
<i>this amazing number.</i>

14:41.814 --> 14:46.119
<i>So if she's going to start</i>
<i>treating Kendall better,</i>

14:46.119 --> 14:47.820
<i>I'll take it in a heartbeat.</i>

14:47.820 --> 14:51.090
Kendall's going up
against JoJo and Kalani,

14:51.090 --> 14:54.293
<i>so this is her chance</i>
<i>to prove herself.</i>

14:54.293 --> 14:55.862
ABBY LEE:
<i>All right.</i>

14:55.862 --> 14:57.330
This dance is gonna look like

14:57.330 --> 14:58.898
every other lyrical
and contemporary

14:58.898 --> 15:00.833
dance that Gianna
and I have done

15:00.833 --> 15:03.169
if you let it.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.138
If you don't do what
we're telling you,

15:05.138 --> 15:07.173
that's what's gonna
end up going on stage.

15:12.812 --> 15:16.382
ABBY LEE: <i>This is not</i>
<i>a Fosse number, although</i>

15:16.382 --> 15:18.985
he was famous for doing
<i>Cabaret</i> and the <i>Cabaret</i> chai.

15:18.985 --> 15:21.821
Although we can learn
from Mr. Bob Fosse

15:21.821 --> 15:23.923
in that some times,
less is more.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.726
The words are really
about the frumpy girl.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.194
You're the dream.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.530
You're dreaming that this
is you on this stage now.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.831
Okay, let's hear it.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.267
Kalani is doing a very sultry

15:34.267 --> 15:37.103
<i>jazz routine to</i>
<i>"On the Edge of My Seat."</i>

15:37.103 --> 15:38.404
<i>This is the first time</i>

15:38.404 --> 15:40.606
<i>we're gonna see my dancers</i>
<i>performing solos</i>

15:40.606 --> 15:42.475
<i>since Maddie</i>
<i>and Mackenzie left,</i>

15:42.475 --> 15:44.844
and I want the judges to be
on the edge of their seats.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.913
Kalani, do this hand
go under this knee,

15:46.913 --> 15:48.147
and this hand
to this shoulder.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.348
Dah‐dah.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.817
<i>Dah. Right.</i>

15:51.884 --> 15:55.254
That's pretty, okay?

15:55.254 --> 15:57.423
Did she do this dance
in heels once?

15:57.423 --> 15:59.292
JILL:
<i>The song sounds so familiar.</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:00.493
JESSALYNN:
<i>McKenzie Morales</i>

16:00.493 --> 16:01.494
used it.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.529
That's who used it.
JILL: She did?

16:03.529 --> 16:05.331
JESSALYNN: <i>And I think Paige</i>
<i>used that chair.</i>

16:05.331 --> 16:07.834
<i>I feel like that's Paige's</i>
<i>chair, but Kenzie's song.</i>

16:07.834 --> 16:09.268
Now Kalani has the dance.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.437
Personally, I think
Abby's setting Kalani up to...

16:11.437 --> 16:14.073
not do very well this week.

16:14.073 --> 16:17.677
JILL: <i>This dance is hokey.</i>
<i>Kalani can do so much more.</i>

16:17.677 --> 16:20.146
<i>Abby really owes it to her</i>

16:20.146 --> 16:23.115
to give her a great routine,
and this isn't it.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.517
Think about your mother.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.252
You know, a lady
that doesn't work too hard.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.224
I'll be right back, Gianna.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.493
Hello. How's it going?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.194
How are you?

16:35.194 --> 16:36.829
ABBY LEE:
<i>Go check out the minis.</i>

16:36.829 --> 16:38.364
Okay.
Just so that you can

16:38.364 --> 16:40.166
see what they're capable
of doing.
Right.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.068
What they're not capable
of doing.
Okay.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.604
Chris is a professional,
working choreographer,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.372
<i>and he is going</i>
<i>to work with the minis</i>

16:46.372 --> 16:48.608
<i>to get their timing together.</i>

16:48.608 --> 16:52.178
<i>They need to dance as one,</i>
<i>and if they don't,</i>

16:52.178 --> 16:54.747
there might not <i>be</i>
a mini team anymore.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.416
So I call this the monkey‐see,
monkey‐do muscle, okay?

16:57.416 --> 16:59.051
And basically
what that is‐‐

16:59.051 --> 17:01.120
it's how quickly your eyes

17:01.120 --> 17:03.489
and mind can see me
doing a movement,

17:03.489 --> 17:05.458
and how quickly you can
pick that up. So you're gonna

17:05.458 --> 17:07.727
see something. Like, "Oh,
I got that. I already got it."

17:07.727 --> 17:09.896
For example, if I just
put my arm up like this,

17:09.896 --> 17:11.864
how fast can you do that?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.666
Ready?

17:13.666 --> 17:16.035
So you saw it once,
but now, if I do a new movement,

17:16.035 --> 17:17.503
how fast can you do that?

17:17.503 --> 17:19.505
Oh.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.974
Cool.

17:21.974 --> 17:22.975
One, two,

17:22.975 --> 17:24.310
three, four,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.345
five, six,
seven, eight.

17:26.345 --> 17:29.015
One. Hit, hit,
down. Ha.

17:29.015 --> 17:32.084
Walk, walk, walk, wah. Yes!

17:32.084 --> 17:33.553
That's what
I'm talking about.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.155
So girls, get with your moms.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.224
SARI: This is so cool.
This is really cool.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.359
We never get these kind
of opportunities.
Yeah.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.795
As a matter of fact, I think
this is a first for the ALDC

17:42.795 --> 17:44.263
to have someone, like...
Oh.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.532
...come in and work
with the girls, not in...

17:46.532 --> 17:48.200
like, doing a routine
this week.
Right.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.569
So it's huge.
Exactly. Oh, cool.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.870
That's nice to know.
Absolutely.
So thank you so much.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.005
So thank you so much.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.340
Cool. Well...
We're excited.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.875
We were happy
about that.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.143
(Chris laughs)

17:57.143 --> 17:59.178
Crossed in front, yes.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.614
But then, again, your arms
are gonna, like, ooh.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.015
They have to be stronger.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.285
So put that together.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.354
Five, six, seven and

18:08.354 --> 18:10.890
one and two,
three, four.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.792
But you can't look
like dead weight.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.427
You need to, like, pounce.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.662
<i>When you do the push back</i>
<i>to the push‐up position,</i>

18:16.662 --> 18:18.831
dig your toes under.
It looks better.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.066
Boom. Then it's right...

18:20.066 --> 18:22.268
You need to, like, go...
This is fast.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.605
Like, in, and then go
like a rounded hunchback.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.109
I don't care.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.510
So, where's "Boomerang"?

18:31.510 --> 18:32.678
Still up there?
Hanging?

18:32.678 --> 18:34.313
It's up there.
I think it's at three now.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.148
That is so good.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.084
So good, you guys.
Like, so good.
Yeah.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.119
<i>JoJo's first music video,</i>
<i>"Boomerang,"</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:43.756
<i>is gonna make JoJo</i>
<i>a huge pop star.</i>

18:43.756 --> 18:48.027
<i>But it's no secret</i>
<i>that Abby wants Kendall to win.</i>

18:48.027 --> 18:49.662
<i>It's gonna be tough for JoJo.</i>

18:49.662 --> 18:50.863
<i>JoJo doesn't win a lot.</i>

18:50.863 --> 18:52.264
<i>JoJo doesn't normally get</i>

18:52.264 --> 18:54.367
<i>the winning numbers</i>
<i>from Abby, so,</i>

18:54.367 --> 18:56.369
I need JoJo to nail this solo

18:56.369 --> 18:59.972
<i>to preserve her image</i>
<i>and her brand,</i>

18:59.972 --> 19:02.074
and prove to Abby
that she has what it takes

19:02.074 --> 19:04.076
to be the next big star
on this team.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.645
Or like you say,
like a little kid

19:05.645 --> 19:06.812
from Nebraska. Uh...

19:06.812 --> 19:08.514
A little kid
from Nebraska with a big

19:08.514 --> 19:10.049
platform and a lot to say.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.618
So, that being said,
you don't need Abby

19:12.618 --> 19:14.654
to do what you need to do
with Kendall.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.256
Like, I started last year
doing my own thing.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.291
You know, Jess is doing
her own thing.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.160
You can do your own thing.
JESSALYNN:
I think Abby

19:21.160 --> 19:22.595
doesn't believe
that you'll go

19:22.595 --> 19:23.996
do your new thing.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.965
I think she's just trying
to bait you a little bit more

19:25.965 --> 19:27.933
and a little bit more.
Prove her wrong.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.136
JILL: <i>You know what?</i>
<i>I know why they're saying that,</i>

19:30.136 --> 19:32.271
<i>but now Abby gave her</i>
<i>that first solo</i>

19:32.271 --> 19:35.207
since the break,
and I‐I love it,

19:35.207 --> 19:36.609
and Kendall loves it.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.477
<i>These beautiful</i>
<i>contemporary numbers</i>

19:38.477 --> 19:41.147
<i>are usually reserved</i>
<i>for Kalani or Brynn.</i>

19:41.147 --> 19:44.650
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe this is Abby's way</i>

19:44.650 --> 19:48.621
<i>of saying she'll do better as</i>
<i>her manager for her music, so,</i>

19:48.621 --> 19:50.356
if Abby came to me and said,
"Look, I...

19:50.356 --> 19:51.624
"You know, I messed up,

19:51.624 --> 19:53.759
and I really want
to help put these songs out,"

19:53.759 --> 19:56.328
<i>who knows?</i>
<i>I might reconsider.</i>

19:56.328 --> 19:57.496
I don't know, guys.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.864
I don't own
any of Kendall's songs.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.499
She wants to put it out,

20:00.499 --> 20:01.967
I would let her because I think
it's a really good song.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.269
Yeah.
HOLLY:
You know what?

20:03.269 --> 20:04.537
We're gonna have to
take you to a mountaintop,

20:04.537 --> 20:06.138
and let you sing "Let It Go."

20:06.138 --> 20:08.274
(laughter)
Just let... Just take you...

20:08.274 --> 20:09.942
JILL:
But will there be snow?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.444
We will... Yes.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.579
Because you're being snowed
by Abby right now,

20:13.579 --> 20:15.114
and you're just like...

20:15.114 --> 20:16.816
Let it go, Jill.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.051
ABBY LEE: JoJo, some of the
things you did look ferocious.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.855
Some of them looked...

20:22.855 --> 20:24.323
Atrocious.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.758
Good word.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.393
You can't have a dance
called "Ferocious,"

20:27.393 --> 20:30.162
and it be a solo, and then,
you come out and be mediocre.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.465
Atrocious.
Yes. Okay, go.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.034
All right.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.068
They're done.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.436
JESSALYNN:
So, Abby,

20:37.436 --> 20:38.871
what's going on with Kendall

20:38.871 --> 20:40.272
and all that music?

20:40.272 --> 20:41.540
I don't know. It's my attorney.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.509
Got to figure out what he's...
what we're doing.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.978
JESSALYNN: You're still
taking a whole album

20:45.978 --> 20:48.347
and not letting a kid
that did have a number one song

20:48.347 --> 20:50.249
release it.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.652
Nope. They don't want
to work with me.
JESSALYNN: No, Abby...

20:54.954 --> 20:56.989
JILL:
You've held her up

20:56.989 --> 21:01.026
for two years. She's had a whole
album you've been sitting on.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.461
You're trying to open up
a can of worms.

21:02.461 --> 21:03.863
I'm not, Abby.
I said...

21:03.863 --> 21:06.198
...that you really don't have
the educational background

21:06.198 --> 21:07.500
to even comment on.
How do you know?

21:07.500 --> 21:10.302
I have twice the educational
background you have.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.670
You don't have a law degree.
No, I do not.

21:11.670 --> 21:12.972
Yeah.
And neither do you.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.106
No, I don't.
And that's why

21:14.106 --> 21:16.776
my attorney contacted
your attorney

21:16.776 --> 21:18.744
to get it taken care of.
Uh...

21:18.744 --> 21:20.613
You're nobody,
and you're nothing.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.783
She's not nobody. She has...
No, she's not!
Now she isn't! Four years ago,

21:23.783 --> 21:26.685
before I put your ass
in a chair, you were.
And so were you,

21:26.685 --> 21:28.721
Abby! You were nobody, too!

21:28.721 --> 21:33.559
You used these kids
to put you where you are now!

21:33.559 --> 21:35.895
I was driving a Hummer.
I had a great business.
Abby...

21:35.895 --> 21:38.297
I made a lot of money.
I flew all over the world.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.833
When I met you,
your car was impounded.
JESSALYNN: Abby. Abby.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.302
My dad died,
and he did my billing, Jill!

21:43.302 --> 21:46.005
It's irrelevant, that is,
with Kendall and her music.
No.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.607
That's not irrelevant
into slamming my character

21:48.607 --> 21:50.442
and saying I was nothing,
I was nobody.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.311
You said it to my child first!
No...

21:52.311 --> 21:53.913
It... To my face!

21:53.913 --> 21:55.181
And you did (bleep)
for me,

21:55.181 --> 21:56.515
Abby. (bleep).

21:56.515 --> 21:57.850
So that's fine.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.252
JILL:
<i>You know? I was under her spell</i>

22:00.252 --> 22:02.588
<i>with Kendall's choreography.</i>

22:02.588 --> 22:04.590
<i>But now she showed</i>
<i>her true colors.</i>

22:04.590 --> 22:07.960
And, you know what,
enough is enough. I'm over it.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.962
<i>But I hope Abby has</i>
<i>enough sense</i>

22:09.962 --> 22:13.566
to keep the music separate
from the dance.

But whatever. Kendall,
I love your solo.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.695
This is our first solo
since Maddie's left.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.632
But I think the question is, are
these solos new and different

23:19.632 --> 23:21.567
for each of you? Or is it
something you can all say,

23:21.567 --> 23:23.302

KALANI:
<i>This week, I have,</i>

23:25.104 --> 23:29.074
like, an open musical
theater‐type solo with a chair.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.210
<i>And I danced with a chair</i>
<i>when I was eight.</i>

23:31.210 --> 23:32.278
<i>I've never danced with a chair</i>

23:32.278 --> 23:33.746
when I was 15.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.848
Is it gonna stretch you to ma...

23:35.848 --> 23:38.083
get you to that next level?
Probably not.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.953
Oh, I actually disagree
with that in a huge way.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.222
But if we're all only getting
one solo this season,

23:43.222 --> 23:46.025
is that the solo
that you would want? Like...

23:46.025 --> 23:47.993
Actually, it is, it is. It is.
Okay, good.

23:47.993 --> 23:50.129
Kalani, is that the
solo you would want?
No.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.263
(clamoring)
See?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.165
Well, well...
Now, listen
to your child.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.667
But she doesn't want to do

23:54.667 --> 23:56.735
contemporary dancing
all her life.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.973
I think you guys have
some communication gaps.

<i>I don't know why</i>

<i>doesn't fight for Kalani.</i>

24:07.079 --> 24:08.747
Kira wasn't here much
last season,

24:08.747 --> 24:12.318

she still wasn't committed.

24:12.318 --> 24:14.486
<i>Musical theater is</i>
<i>a tough category</i>

24:14.486 --> 24:16.288
<i>when you're in the teens.</i>

24:16.288 --> 24:19.825
If Kalani were eight,
it'd be amazing, but she's not.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.161
<i>And the fact that this dance</i>
<i>with the chair</i>

24:22.161 --> 24:25.798
is so gimmicky
won't help Kalani win at all.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.666
I'm sick of seeing her
dance contemporary,

24:27.666 --> 24:28.834
so I'm fine with it.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.035
Doesn't sound
like you and Kalani

24:30.035 --> 24:32.137
are on the same page
as to what Kalani wants.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.505
JESSALYNN: Going to
the competition Saturday,

24:33.505 --> 24:36.308
do you think that is the best
solo that Kalani could bring?

24:36.308 --> 24:37.876
KIRA:
I would never take

24:37.876 --> 24:39.812
any solo she's done here.
Right.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.780
Abby should take
the oldest girls

24:41.780 --> 24:43.949
that are
the strongest competitors,

24:43.949 --> 24:46.185
give them the best dances

24:46.185 --> 24:47.319
<i>and the most time.</i>

24:47.319 --> 24:49.088
<i>And of all people,</i>
<i>Kira should be</i>

24:49.088 --> 24:50.589

24:50.589 --> 24:51.623
<i>"I don't care."</i>

24:51.623 --> 24:52.791
I can't help but wonder

24:52.791 --> 24:55.427
what would become of Kalani
if Kira cared.

24:55.427 --> 24:57.529
Five, six, seven, eight.

competing tomorrow?

25:30.095 --> 25:32.264
And one, two,

25:32.264 --> 25:33.866
three‐‐ both arms.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.868

this this week?
STACEY: Oh, that is so rude.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.171
No.
Are they?

25:39.171 --> 25:40.239
No, we're just...

25:40.239 --> 25:41.507
Can you back up a little bit

25:41.507 --> 25:42.975
so I can see my kid in class?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.209
Your kids aren't competing

25:44.209 --> 25:45.611
this weekend; ours are.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.079
How many classes

25:47.079 --> 25:49.114
did you guys have
today already?

25:49.114 --> 25:51.116
ABBY LEE:
And yours are in a very...

25:51.116 --> 25:53.318
good ballet class.
We like that. Yeah.

25:53.318 --> 25:56.455
But‐but...
Friday‐‐ tomorrow‐‐

25:56.455 --> 25:58.690
at 9:00 a. m.,
our kids are competing,

25:58.690 --> 26:01.060
and they haven't run
their group dance at all today.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.195
So we're gonna find someone
else to run the number,

26:03.195 --> 26:05.397
because you don't want to.
If you interrupt
our ballet class,

26:05.397 --> 26:08.767
your kid will not dance, Jill.
That is your...

26:08.767 --> 26:10.836
Uh, okay, well, they're all
gonna find someone.
If you interrupt

26:10.836 --> 26:13.205

and that teacher...
Okay, Abby, nice threats.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.940
'cause you're a stupid (bleep)!

26:14.940 --> 26:18.544

No! You do not interrupt
that ballet class!

26:18.544 --> 26:20.379
Do not interrupt!
JESSALYNN: We're not! We're not!

26:20.379 --> 26:21.780
Do not!
So you understand,

26:21.780 --> 26:23.082
if you don't run the number,
we'll find

26:23.082 --> 26:24.116
somebody else that will.
That's right.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.684
SARI: Why do they have
to call the shot?

26:25.684 --> 26:28.020
I don't get that.
ABBY LEE: Why do think that

26:28.020 --> 26:29.188

26:29.188 --> 26:31.423
They have nobody
working professionally!

26:31.423 --> 26:32.658

<i>with Jess and Jill?</i>

26:35.127 --> 26:36.962

<i>And Jess? After she begged</i>

26:46.405 --> 26:48.307
We do hip‐hop,
we do musical theater,

26:48.307 --> 26:50.175
we do tumbling.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.645
<i>Maybe we need to not do, like,</i>
<i>so many frivolous classes,</i>

26:53.645 --> 26:56.081
and do more of what we need.

26:56.081 --> 26:57.416
Yes.

26:58.517 --> 26:59.918
This is how they show
their gratitude?

26:59.918 --> 27:02.020
How about,
"Thank you, Miss Abby."

27:02.020 --> 27:03.922
<i>I'm gonna run the number</i>
<i>with the elites.</i>

27:03.922 --> 27:05.924
<i>Not because</i>
<i>it's what their mothers want,</i>

27:05.924 --> 27:07.759
<i>but because</i>
<i>I don't want them to have</i>

27:07.759 --> 27:10.129
<i>any excuse</i>
<i>for not winning first place.</i>

27:10.129 --> 27:11.630
You're gonna go out the door.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.465
You're welcome. Thank you,
you're dismissed.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.868
<i>Come on, girls!</i>

27:15.868 --> 27:18.103
Everybody
take a sword.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.139
Let's go. Go.
Get it and get back.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.907
<i>They're doing "Mind Craft,"</i>

27:21.907 --> 27:24.276
<i>inspired by the game Minecraf.</i>

27:24.276 --> 27:26.044
I was with my cart
going through the store,

27:26.044 --> 27:28.213
and up on a shelf
I saw the sword,

27:28.213 --> 27:29.982
<i>and I thought,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God, this is great."</i>

27:29.982 --> 27:31.450
<i>That was my inspiration piece.</i>

27:31.450 --> 27:34.219
<i>You know when you decorate</i>
<i>a room, and you find</i>

27:34.219 --> 27:36.688
this great pillow or a vase,
it's the perfect color

27:36.688 --> 27:39.158
and you love it,
and then you get the wallpaper

27:39.158 --> 27:41.360
and the carpeting and the paint
and everything

27:41.360 --> 27:43.595
to match this one pillow
and this vase?

27:43.595 --> 27:46.698
Until somebody breaks the vase
and throws up on the pillow.

27:46.698 --> 27:50.802
But anyway, the sword
was my inspiration piece.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.728
Sweetheart, I've been doing this
longer than you've been alive,

33:49.728 --> 33:52.330

down on a piece of paper.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.466

<i>Abby doesn't care about anyone</i>

33:55.734 --> 33:56.835
but herself.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.370
Abby thinks that she looks great

33:58.370 --> 34:00.105
and she looks
all high and mighty,

34:00.105 --> 34:03.408
<i>and she refuses to see</i>
<i>the damage she's doing.</i>

34:03.408 --> 34:04.876
<i>This is a big week for JoJo.</i>

34:04.876 --> 34:08.513
<i>JoJo has a great solo,</i>
<i>and I need Abby in her court.</i>

Okay.

34:45.216 --> 34:46.518

34:46.518 --> 34:48.920
Are we back to doing solos
every competition?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.022
You know, I don't want to make
promises that I can't keep.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.458
Didn't you enjoy...
You appeared to really be

34:53.458 --> 34:55.060

34:55.060 --> 34:56.494

34:56.494 --> 34:59.798

each kid in a great way

34:59.798 --> 35:01.866

35:01.866 --> 35:03.134
Well, you're welcome, sweetie.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.903
KIRA: Would you rather them
be doing solos,

35:04.903 --> 35:06.871

35:06.871 --> 35:09.708
Oh, absolutely solos.
Absolutely.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.077
I would love to keep giving
my girls solos.

35:12.077 --> 35:13.378
<i>But they need</i>

35:13.378 --> 35:15.880
<i>and pull off a win.</i>

35:15.880 --> 35:18.283
Maddie seemed to do it
with ease.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.418
I'm entering three solos today;

35:20.418 --> 35:22.120
one of them better win.

35:23.054 --> 35:24.489
Ready to go in?

35:24.489 --> 35:25.890
I'm sad that
I don't get

TIFFANIE: <i>We're here</i>
<i>to support the juniors,</i>

35:30.295 --> 35:33.198
because we are part
of the ALDC,

35:33.198 --> 35:36.568
<i>but all week, the junior moms</i>
<i>were rude to our girls.</i>

35:36.568 --> 35:38.036
This week...

35:38.036 --> 35:39.037
you are not competing.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.272
(others cheering)

35:41.272 --> 35:44.442
Your kids aren't competing
this weekend; ours are.

35:44.442 --> 35:47.312
And I just don't understand why,
as grown women,

35:47.312 --> 35:51.249
we cannot come together,
like our kids, and be a team.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.717
I think we should
really say something,

35:52.717 --> 35:54.486
because it's kind of getting
out of hand.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.488
What do we have to lose?

35:56.488 --> 35:57.956
KENDALL:
<i>I'm excited...</i>

You guys have
good dances,

35:59.624 --> 36:02.227

We just wanted to come in
and say good luck, and...

36:18.476 --> 36:21.813
we just want to talk to you guys
about being mean to our girls.

36:23.314 --> 36:24.382
That is disparaging
my character

36:24.382 --> 36:26.051

Excuse me,
what did I do yesterday?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.493
Well, the whole...
the whole fit‐throwing...

36:35.493 --> 36:37.095
Okay, you're ignorant.
I am not staying here

36:37.095 --> 36:39.998

about my professional character.

36:39.998 --> 36:43.168
So if you want that,
the last O. G. will be gone.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.736
'Cause if that's what she wants,

36:44.736 --> 36:47.872

about my character

36:47.872 --> 36:50.008

she's the leader of the team,

all the time.

48:09.019 --> 48:10.287
It worked out.

48:10.287 --> 48:13.190
Kalani is
completely fine.

48:13.190 --> 48:16.260
Right, okay? So, but "fine"
should not be good enough

48:16.260 --> 48:17.528
for someone that is

48:17.528 --> 48:19.530
wanting to be a dancer.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.966
HOLLY: Kalani deserves
to have her own costume

48:21.966 --> 48:24.802
created just for her
in mind today.

48:24.802 --> 48:26.737
JESSALYNN:
I think Abby just knows

48:26.737 --> 48:28.439
she can put in
minimal effort with you,

48:28.439 --> 48:30.107
and it's okay, honestly.

48:30.107 --> 48:31.942
What was I sup...
Do you want me to pull the solo?

48:31.942 --> 48:34.845
I won't do that.
But you could say,
"Abby, this is really...

48:34.845 --> 48:37.047
"a (bleep) deal‐‐ my kid
is one of your best dancers,

48:37.047 --> 48:38.849
and this is what
we're wearing today."

48:38.849 --> 48:42.820
JESSALYNN:
<i>Abby thinks that Kalani is</i>
<i>the best dancer on the team,</i>

48:42.820 --> 48:45.890
<i>and if JoJo had that talent,</i>
<i>I would fight for JoJo</i>

48:45.890 --> 48:48.759
<i>to have a good dance</i>
<i>and a good costume every week.</i>

48:48.759 --> 48:49.894
<i>But...</i>

48:49.894 --> 48:51.362
Kira's not gonna fight
for Kalani.

48:51.362 --> 48:53.597
Kira doesn't give a (bleep).
We all know that.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.499
HOLLY: Know your worth.
If you put your foot down

48:55.499 --> 48:58.169
and say,
"My kid is better than that,

48:58.169 --> 49:00.571
she is not going on stage
like that,"

49:00.571 --> 49:02.640
that would get
her attention.

49:02.640 --> 49:03.941

Kalani needs you

49:03.941 --> 49:05.876
to fight the battle,
she really does.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.680
JESSALYNN:
I think Abby just wakes up
and is like, "Oh, shoot,

49:09.680 --> 49:11.549
"Kalani doesn't have a costume,
but Kira won't really care.

49:11.549 --> 49:12.817
She doesn't
really get mad at me."

49:16.120 --> 49:17.755
You didn't give Kalani
a costume

49:17.755 --> 49:19.523
because you know her mom
doesn't care.

49:19.523 --> 49:21.425
If JoJo didn't have a costume
I would be pissed.

49:21.425 --> 49:22.526

49:25.796 --> 49:27.498

49:27.498 --> 49:30.034

Kalani did not have a costume

49:30.034 --> 49:31.702

through the door.

"fine" isn't good enough.

55:11.608 --> 55:15.078
...number 26,
"On the Edge of My Seat."

55:15.078 --> 55:16.914
(applause, whooping)

55:18.549 --> 55:20.884
KIRA:
<i>I hate to say it,</i>

55:20.884 --> 55:23.086
<i>but the moms are right‐‐</i>

55:23.086 --> 55:25.656
<i>dancing with a chair</i>
<i>at age 15</i>

55:25.656 --> 55:27.624
<i>resulted in fourth place.</i>

55:27.624 --> 55:30.961
I need to think about her future
and her dance career future.

55:30.961 --> 55:33.330
<i>Things might change.</i>
And lastly,

55:33.330 --> 55:36.400
our top elite team solo,

55:36.400 --> 55:39.236
with a perfect score, is...

55:39.236 --> 55:40.671
<i>I'm shocked that JoJo's name</i>

55:40.671 --> 55:41.872
hasn't been called yet.

55:41.872 --> 55:43.740
<i>She has a lot</i>
<i>going on right now.</i>

55:43.740 --> 55:45.542
<i>She wants to be a star.</i>

55:45.542 --> 55:48.545
It would really be something
if JoJo's name is called first,

55:48.545 --> 55:49.980
and that would prove something

55:49.980 --> 55:52.816
<i>for her fans and her image</i>
<i>and her brand.</i>

55:52.816 --> 55:54.751
Drumroll.

55:58.322 --> 56:00.157
Number 49, "Trust"!

56:04.061 --> 56:06.330
ABBY LEE: <i>I think the girls had</i>
<i>a rude awakening.</i>

56:06.330 --> 56:07.531
<i>Before, it was always,</i>

56:07.531 --> 56:10.200
"Well, I was second
because Maddie won,"

56:10.200 --> 56:12.603
<i>or, "I was third</i>
<i>because Maddie beat me."</i>

56:12.603 --> 56:14.438
Now...

56:14.438 --> 56:16.640
<i>what's your excuse, girls?</i>

56:16.640 --> 56:19.576
ANNOUNCER:
In our elite team

56:19.576 --> 56:22.179
small group,
we have a top three.

56:22.179 --> 56:23.981
HOLLY: <i>This is the week</i>
<i>the minis were benched.</i>

56:23.981 --> 56:25.949
<i>It is imperative</i>

56:25.949 --> 56:28.685
that the elite competition team
pulls out a win.

56:28.685 --> 56:31.188
<i>Otherwise, we can't say</i>

56:31.188 --> 56:32.522
that the minis
are distracting Abby

56:32.522 --> 56:35.459
<i>from allowing the girls</i>
<i>to reach their full potential</i>

56:35.459 --> 56:36.593
as dancers.

56:36.593 --> 56:38.862
In third place...

56:43.333 --> 56:44.935
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

56:44.935 --> 56:47.237
Maybe this is
Kendall's opportunity now

56:47.237 --> 56:48.872
to move forward with her music.

56:48.872 --> 56:51.108
That's a very blunt
and rude way to say it.

56:51.108 --> 56:52.109
I think she's probably

56:52.109 --> 56:53.577
suing me for something.

56:59.283 --> 57:01.184
ANNOUNCER:
<i>In our elite team</i>

57:01.184 --> 57:03.353
small group,
we have a top three.

57:03.353 --> 57:05.122
In third place...

57:09.126 --> 57:12.062
...number 18,
"The Nicest Thing."

57:12.963 --> 57:15.565
In second place...

57:15.565 --> 57:17.434
number 11,

57:17.434 --> 57:18.969
"Do It Well."

57:18.969 --> 57:20.737
(applause)

57:20.737 --> 57:22.406
And for our top

57:22.406 --> 57:25.943
elite team small group
of the weekend...

57:25.943 --> 57:29.046
number 51, "Mind Craft."

57:29.046 --> 57:32.249
(applause, cheering)

57:34.418 --> 57:36.086
Where do
you guys dance?

57:36.086 --> 57:38.889
Abby Lee Dance Company!

57:38.889 --> 57:40.457
JILL:
<i>Thank God the group won.</i>

57:40.457 --> 57:43.460
I would not want to face Abby
if the group

57:43.460 --> 57:46.596
<i>didn't win after the solos</i>
<i>did so poorly.</i>

57:46.596 --> 57:48.298
Thanks, girls.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.600
Congratulations.

57:50.600 --> 57:51.601
Thank you.
Thank you.

57:51.601 --> 57:52.869
Thank you.
Really proud of the girls.

57:52.869 --> 57:54.304
I'm really proud of the soloists
and the team.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.474
JILL: Yeah. I think they
really did well. However,

57:57.474 --> 57:59.776
I'm not making excuses at all,

57:59.776 --> 58:03.080
but when we first started
in our dressing room, Abby was

58:03.080 --> 58:05.649
having a...
an argument with the director.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.918
And we're like,
"Oh. We're screwed."

58:07.918 --> 58:09.353
"We might as well go home."

58:09.353 --> 58:11.421
TIFFANIE:
It sounds like excuses.

58:11.421 --> 58:14.157
Like, I mean,
that's what it sounds like.
JILL: No, no.

58:14.157 --> 58:15.726
It can't do well
for our kids.

58:15.726 --> 58:17.527
Like, she was bitching
to her, saying, "Honey,

58:17.527 --> 58:19.429
I've been doing this
longer than you've been born."

58:19.429 --> 58:20.998
You don't do that.
Well, they still

58:20.998 --> 58:23.000
won the group,
so that doesn't really...
Because our group

58:23.000 --> 58:25.769
probably was that much better
than all the others.

58:25.769 --> 58:27.337
The solos, maybe,

58:27.337 --> 58:29.306
could have gone either way.
Place‐wise,

58:29.306 --> 58:31.341
they placed better
with the duets last week,

58:31.341 --> 58:32.843
than the solos this week.

58:32.843 --> 58:36.146
JESSALYNN: Okay, but it doesn't
matter‐‐ it's a mini duet

58:36.146 --> 58:37.581
at a totally different
competition

58:37.581 --> 58:39.649
with different dancers
and different judges.

58:39.649 --> 58:42.052
It's stupid that
you're even saying that.

58:42.052 --> 58:44.388
This is why we don't
consider you part of the team.

58:44.388 --> 58:46.056
Instead of coming out
and saying,

58:46.056 --> 58:48.859
"Congratulations on your win, we
thought the solos looked great,"

58:48.859 --> 58:50.727
you have to bring us down, so...

58:50.727 --> 58:52.295
good job.

58:52.295 --> 58:55.899
Good job.
You're wonderful human beings.

58:55.899 --> 58:59.336
I‐I‐I c... see,
I can't even begin.

58:59.336 --> 59:01.605
<i>I‐I don't understand</i>
<i>those mini moms.</i>

59:01.605 --> 59:05.108
<i>Why are they so negative?</i>
<i>That made no sense to me.</i>

59:05.108 --> 59:08.278
<i>We don't need any of this crap</i>
<i>around here.</i>

59:08.278 --> 59:10.914
You will never,
ever be part of us.

59:10.914 --> 59:12.049
Get a grip.
You're not here

59:12.049 --> 59:13.483
to support our girls.

59:13.483 --> 59:15.752
Bye!
Bye!
Bye again! Bye!

59:15.752 --> 59:17.020
JILL: Not being

59:17.020 --> 59:18.555
part of the team!

59:18.555 --> 59:20.490
JESSALYNN:
You'll always be the B squad.

59:21.525 --> 59:23.026
JILL:
<i>For that...</i>

59:23.026 --> 59:25.295
display of disgusting support,

59:25.295 --> 59:27.397
they will never be
a part of the team.

59:27.397 --> 59:29.900
HOLLY: Well, Abby has
quite a talent to find

59:29.900 --> 59:31.902
the rudest mothers on earth

59:31.902 --> 59:33.770
and invite them
to be part of the team.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.238
Look me in the eye, bitch.

59:35.238 --> 59:37.374
Bitch, let's go. Let's go.

59:37.374 --> 59:38.608
Bite me!

59:39.409 --> 59:42.479
(clamoring)

59:43.847 --> 59:45.282
Bitch!

59:48.885 --> 59:49.886
(bleep) you, Abby.

59:49.886 --> 59:51.354
If you have people like that

59:51.354 --> 59:53.590
supporting you,
you don't need enemies.

59:53.590 --> 59:55.992
(laughs)

59:55.992 --> 59:59.262
JESSALYNN: Hey, lovers! Hey!
HOLLY: Hey! Yay!

59:59.262 --> 1:00:01.765
Good job, honey. Don't... I
want you to hold your head high,
Thank you.

1:00:01.765 --> 1:00:03.633
'cause you were
beautiful.

1:00:05.402 --> 1:00:06.937
(groans)

1:00:09.005 --> 1:00:10.407
We had three soloists
dance today,

1:00:10.407 --> 1:00:12.609
and you were seventh,

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:14.778
and you were...

1:00:14.778 --> 1:00:15.779
fourth.

1:00:15.779 --> 1:00:17.948
Even though
Kalani's costume worked,

1:00:17.948 --> 1:00:21.818
that's not the costume
that... she deserves.

1:00:21.818 --> 1:00:23.420
ABBY LEE:
Oh. Well.

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:26.356
Like, that...

1:00:26.356 --> 1:00:27.524
shouldn't be okay.

1:00:27.524 --> 1:00:29.926
<i>Kalani doesn't place fourth.</i>

1:00:29.926 --> 1:00:33.797
If Abby ever does another solo
for Kalani again,

1:00:33.797 --> 1:00:35.899
she will not be getting
fourth place.

1:00:35.899 --> 1:00:37.501
This is the last time.

1:00:37.501 --> 1:00:40.437
You wanted solos, you got solos.

1:00:40.437 --> 1:00:41.872
JoJo didn't
even place.

1:00:43.373 --> 1:00:45.609
JoJo, you had
a big week.

1:00:45.609 --> 1:00:47.444
You know? Lot‐lot went on.

1:00:47.444 --> 1:00:49.312
You know, I'm not
making excuses for her

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:50.814
by any means, I'm just...
No, no.

1:00:50.814 --> 1:00:53.283
this is life, JoJo.
JESSALYNN:
You can't always win.

1:00:53.283 --> 1:00:55.452
JILL: JoJo,
you know what I say‐‐
JOJO: I never win anyway, so...

1:00:55.452 --> 1:00:57.888
there's always
someone better. Always.

1:00:57.888 --> 1:00:59.222
You danced good.
Your dance was good,

1:00:59.222 --> 1:01:00.657
your costume was good,
your choreography was good.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.993
You did it good.
So you didn't win.

1:01:02.993 --> 1:01:04.327
Who cares?

1:01:04.327 --> 1:01:06.530
<i>I've said winning</i>
<i>isn't everything, but...</i>

1:01:06.530 --> 1:01:08.798
this has to be

1:01:08.798 --> 1:01:11.902
<i>the worst time possible</i>
<i>for JoJo to lose.</i>

1:01:11.902 --> 1:01:13.670
<i>JoJo has a new single,</i>
<i>a music video,</i>

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:15.505
<i>a book coming out,</i>
<i>a patent coming out,</i>

1:01:15.505 --> 1:01:17.541
<i>and if she keeps losing,</i>

1:01:17.541 --> 1:01:19.543
<i>it is not gonna be good</i>
<i>for her brand.</i>

1:01:19.543 --> 1:01:21.211
ABBY LEE: Girls,

1:01:21.211 --> 1:01:24.014
you want to be number one
in everything you do,

1:01:24.014 --> 1:01:25.882
so you need to
work for it.

1:01:25.882 --> 1:01:27.817
Sometimes kids need
to be knocked down a peg or two.

1:01:27.817 --> 1:01:29.853
That's the way
to stay hungry

1:01:29.853 --> 1:01:32.022
and to want it
and to keep working.

1:01:32.022 --> 1:01:34.391
And, you know,
God only gives you

1:01:34.391 --> 1:01:35.725
what you can handle.

1:01:35.725 --> 1:01:37.460
So... these are all lessons

1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:39.496
that build character.

1:01:40.997 --> 1:01:43.066
All right,
we're gonna go change.

1:01:43.066 --> 1:01:44.334
Bye.

1:01:44.334 --> 1:01:46.136
JESSALYNN:
So, Jill,

1:01:46.136 --> 1:01:48.838
you had a great solo this week,
but I have to wonder, did you

1:01:48.838 --> 1:01:51.741
give Kendall a great solo
and go out on a limb for her

1:01:51.741 --> 1:01:54.144
because of everything
that's going on with the music

1:01:54.144 --> 1:01:55.779
and the controversy, and then

1:01:55.779 --> 1:01:58.315
you're trying to
make up for it now?
ABBY LEE: No.

1:01:58.315 --> 1:02:00.550
I think I separate...
I try to separate my...

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:02.886
music business
from my dance studio,

1:02:02.886 --> 1:02:04.988
in some ways.

1:02:04.988 --> 1:02:07.958
Really? 'Cause that's not
what happened last year, but...

1:02:07.958 --> 1:02:10.460
You had a hard time
with that with Nia.
Yeah.

1:02:10.460 --> 1:02:13.396
Holly's been at the studio
for enough years to know

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:16.466
what happens to people
who go behind my back.

1:02:16.466 --> 1:02:18.702
<i>The kid always has to pay</i>
<i>the consequences</i>

1:02:18.702 --> 1:02:19.869
<i>for the parent's mistakes.</i>

1:02:23.773 --> 1:02:25.342
O‐O‐Okay.

1:02:27.844 --> 1:02:30.447
Maybe this was a good break,
because I know that

1:02:30.447 --> 1:02:33.016
you've got a lot going on
with this lawsuit.

1:02:33.016 --> 1:02:34.851
It's been 18 months.
Right.

1:02:34.851 --> 1:02:36.720
It's not going away.

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:40.957
So maybe this is Kendall's
opportunity now to...

1:02:40.957 --> 1:02:43.660
to move forward with her music.

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:46.896
That's a very blunt
and rude way to say it.

1:02:46.896 --> 1:02:48.765
That's how I feel.

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:52.802
It's just too bad you guys can't
come to an agreement and get...

1:02:52.802 --> 1:02:54.771
Oh, I think that...
I think they'll come
to an agreement.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:57.107
I do. I definitely think
they'll come to an agreement.

1:02:57.107 --> 1:02:58.608
JILL:
So, I‐I think she's

1:02:58.608 --> 1:03:01.211
probably suing me for something.
That's what that sounds like.

1:03:02.946 --> 1:03:04.447
The next time

1:03:04.447 --> 1:03:06.383
my attorney's in the building
I'll let you ask him.

1:03:10.453 --> 1:03:12.289
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

1:03:12.289 --> 1:03:13.890
This weekend
was the worst.

1:03:13.890 --> 1:03:16.626
ABBY LEE: <i>A girl who Kalani</i>
<i>and Kira knew personally</i>

1:03:16.626 --> 1:03:17.594
committed suicide.

1:03:17.594 --> 1:03:19.929
<i>The name of the routine</i>

1:03:19.929 --> 1:03:22.232
is "Suicide Hotline."

1:03:22.232 --> 1:03:23.566
<i>This could be</i>
<i>one of those numbers.</i>

1:03:23.566 --> 1:03:24.801
<i>This might fit in</i>

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:27.304
<i>with "Where Have</i>
<i>All the Children Gone?"</i>

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:28.371
<i>and "The Last Text."</i>
KENDALL: <i>I can just tell JoJo</i>

1:03:28.371 --> 1:03:30.340
<i>doesn't really like this danc.</i>

1:03:30.340 --> 1:03:31.775
JESSALYNN:
<i>JoJo's not doing this.</i>

1:03:31.775 --> 1:03:33.843
Girls, where is
the class clown?

1:03:33.843 --> 1:03:35.445
She's not here.
She didn't like the duet idea,

1:03:35.445 --> 1:03:36.413
so she didn't come.

1:03:36.413 --> 1:03:37.781
<i>After being benched,</i>

1:03:37.781 --> 1:03:38.848
they have to pull this out.

1:03:38.848 --> 1:03:39.949
ABBY LEE:
<i>You either make this dance</i>

1:03:39.949 --> 1:03:41.451
<i>or break this dance.</i>
