05:59.159 --> 06:00.928
DON'T WORRY.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.963
I'M NOT WEARING A WIRE.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.898
>> YOU THINK ALL THIS IS, WHAT,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.600
FUNNY?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.835
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR THIS TIME,

06:07.835 --> 06:08.702
NAOMI.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.570
NOW, YOU KNOW EXACTLY

06:09.570 --> 06:10.438
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF SOMEONE

06:10.438 --> 06:11.104
LOOKS TOO CLOSELY

06:11.104 --> 06:11.972
AT THE COMPANY BOOKS.

06:11.972 --> 06:12.840
>> I KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN

06:12.840 --> 06:13.707
TO YOU.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.842
>> BOTH OF US, NAOMI, ALL RIGHT?

06:14.842 --> 06:15.943
LET'S NOT GET IT TWISTED HERE--

06:15.943 --> 06:17.010
TO BOTH OF US.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.747
SO I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOU

06:19.747 --> 06:20.781
WOULD NEVER RISK EXPOSING

06:20.781 --> 06:21.749
YOURSELF LIKE THAT,

06:21.749 --> 06:22.883
SO YOU ARE BLUFFING.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.117
>> AND YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING

06:24.117 --> 06:25.486
ME.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.654
I'M NOT THE DOE-EYED LITTLE

06:26.654 --> 06:27.755
ASSISTANT WHO USED TO DO

06:27.755 --> 06:29.122
ALL YOUR BIDDING.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.692
>> GIVE ME A BREAK.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.461
NAOMI, YOU WERE NEVER JUST

06:33.461 --> 06:34.995
THE DOE-EYED LITTLE ASSISTANT,

06:34.995 --> 06:38.632
AND YOU DAMN WELL KNOW IT.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.034
YOU KNOW, WHAT I DO SEE

06:41.034 --> 06:42.736
IS THAT SOMEHOW YOU'VE BECOME

06:42.736 --> 06:43.604
THE OPPORTUNIST

06:43.604 --> 06:45.506
WHO LATCHED ON TO MY FATHER.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.674
>> I LEARNED FROM THE BEST,

06:46.674 --> 06:48.108
MALCOLM.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.577
AND IF I NEED TO,

06:49.577 --> 06:51.979
I CAN RECALL EVERY SINGLE TIME

06:51.979 --> 06:53.013
YOU GAVE ME MONEY

06:53.013 --> 06:54.715
TO BUY STOLEN DIAMONDS

06:54.715 --> 06:56.517
IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.918
>> OKAY.

STOP TALKING.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.039
AT MY FIRST MANAGEMENT GIG,

32:20.039 --> 32:21.273
THERE WERE ONLY TWO WOMEN

32:21.273 --> 32:22.874
IN THE OFFICE--

32:22.874 --> 32:25.777
ME AND THE CLEANING LADY.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.645
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW

32:26.645 --> 32:27.513
WHAT THEY GAVE ME

32:27.513 --> 32:28.780
AS A WELCOME GIFT?

32:28.780 --> 32:30.282
>> HMM?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.617
>> PENIS COOKIES.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.584
>> AND YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

32:32.584 --> 32:33.452
ABOUT THAT?

32:33.452 --> 32:36.022
>> OH, OF COURSE I DID.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.289
I BIT RIGHT THROUGH

32:44.330 --> 32:45.397
RIGHT, IF I WANTED MY NAME

32:45.397 --> 32:46.298
DRAGGED THROUGH THE MUD

32:46.298 --> 32:47.299
AS SOME GIRL WHO WAS SCARED

32:47.299 --> 32:49.601
TO PLAY WITH THE BIG BOYS.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.371
I IGNORED THE PETTY BATTLES,

32:52.371 --> 32:54.340
AND I WON THE WAR.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.576
>> YEAH, BUT AT WHAT COST?

32:57.576 --> 32:58.444
>> IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED

32:58.444 --> 32:59.311
IN THIS BUSINESS,

32:59.311 --> 33:01.413

33:01.413 --> 33:02.414
WHY DO YOU THINK I GOT

33:02.414 --> 33:03.382
THE NEW BIRKIN BAG A MONTH

33:03.382 --> 33:06.052
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE DID, HMM?

33:06.052 --> 33:07.719
IT'S ABOUT POWER.

33:07.719 --> 33:08.854
IT SAYS, "YES, BITCH,

33:08.854 --> 33:11.890
I DO BREATHE BETTER AIR."

33:11.890 --> 33:14.060
DON'T FORGET THAT.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.916
LITERALLY A DIFFERENT BALLPARK.

34:10.916 --> 34:11.783
>> I KNOW, BUT--

34:11.783 --> 34:13.519
>> THERE ARE NO BUTS, ANNABELLE.

34:13.519 --> 34:15.421
>> AND WE'RE BACK.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.656
