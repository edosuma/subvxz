08:38.847 --> 08:39.847
How did you know?

08:42.652 --> 08:43.734
Yeah!

08:43.818 --> 08:45.069
- We got it.
- That's so funny.

08:45.154 --> 08:47.021
I'm gonna post it to the 'gram!

08:47.106 --> 08:49.273
- That's Instagram, you guys.
- I know.

08:49.358 --> 08:51.192
I'm gonna use valencia,
is that okay you think?

08:51.244 --> 08:52.576
Ay, baby, everybody uses the valencia.

08:52.662 --> 08:53.577
What are you going to use?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.246
The Kelvin, I mean...

08:55.331 --> 08:57.364
(Laughing) Using the kelv...
no, that's silly, for goodness!

08:57.450 --> 08:58.499
For goodness.

08:59.619 --> 09:00.951
We have a huge problem.

09:01.037 --> 09:01.919
We have to leave right now.

09:02.004 --> 09:03.103
Why?

09:03.172 --> 09:05.089
The hottest person here is leaving.

09:05.174 --> 09:07.208
This party's going to be
dead in three to five minutes.

09:07.293 --> 09:08.209
I'm having fun.

09:08.294 --> 09:10.177
You think you are.

09:10.213 --> 09:11.345
But this party is a seven.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.597
We could be missing out on a 10.

09:13.683 --> 09:17.051
Yeah, but we leave and we end up at a six?

09:17.103 --> 09:20.187
I don't know, we (Bleep)
kill ourselves, who cares?

09:20.223 --> 09:21.222
(Grunts)

09:25.194 --> 09:26.644
So if we did have to kill ourselves

09:26.729 --> 09:28.312
how would we do it?

09:28.397 --> 09:29.280
I'd shoot you in the face

09:29.365 --> 09:30.698
and shoot myself in the heart.

09:30.733 --> 09:31.782
(Gasps) Oh my God.

09:31.867 --> 09:33.200
Forget Siggy's, Lincoln has a better party.

09:35.621 --> 09:36.704
Wait, why would you shoot me in the face?

09:36.739 --> 09:38.622
Also, you said that really fast, dude.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.541
It's nice, you'd die instantly.

09:40.576 --> 09:42.243
Well, then shoot me in
the head, not in the face.

09:42.295 --> 09:43.711
Okay, okay.

09:43.746 --> 09:47.248
♪ ♪

09:48.584 --> 09:50.167
- Yes.
- Wow.

09:50.253 --> 09:51.302
Hey. Hey.

09:51.387 --> 09:53.087
You guys missed it, I just did the worm.

09:53.139 --> 09:54.088
You can do the worm?

09:54.173 --> 09:55.923
- Yeah.
- You barely move.

09:55.975 --> 09:57.391
What?

09:57.426 --> 09:58.926
Whoa.

09:59.011 --> 10:00.311
Lincoln, I don't know if that's...

10:00.396 --> 10:02.012
No, let him have this.

10:02.098 --> 10:04.064
And I do, I do pec jumps.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.065
(Gasps)

10:05.101 --> 10:06.400
Do that again.

10:06.435 --> 10:07.985
(Laughing)

10:08.070 --> 10:09.653
Is this a new shirt?

10:09.739 --> 10:11.021
No, but...

10:12.325 --> 10:13.657
Drink, food, drink.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.776
- Can you worm us there?
- Worm us there.

10:15.828 --> 10:22.616
(Music playing)

10:23.919 --> 10:25.202
This charcuterie.

10:25.288 --> 10:27.504
They got dog dick, ghost poop, grapes

10:27.590 --> 10:28.956
and they got cornichons.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.624
I love cornichons.

10:30.676 --> 10:31.959
Don't I look like a giant?

10:32.044 --> 10:34.094
- (Grunts)
- (Laughing)

10:34.130 --> 10:35.546
That is so weird.

10:35.631 --> 10:37.798
I was just googling
micropenises this morning

10:37.850 --> 10:39.049
and they look exactly like that.

10:39.135 --> 10:40.634
All lumpy and (Bleep).

10:40.686 --> 10:43.020
Come on, don't ruin cornichons for me.

10:43.105 --> 10:44.438
You saw I was

10:44.473 --> 10:45.439
enjoying this.

10:45.474 --> 10:48.642
Okay, don't ruin micropenises for me.

10:48.728 --> 10:49.810
Touché.

10:51.030 --> 10:55.566
(Music playing)

10:58.988 --> 11:00.821
(Laughing)

11:00.873 --> 11:01.989
We have to go, this party's dead.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.407
No, this party is a 10, dude.

11:03.492 --> 11:04.541
What?

11:04.627 --> 11:06.160
I thought so too, but
it's only four or five.

11:06.212 --> 11:07.328
Look.

11:07.413 --> 11:09.880
(Sniffling)

11:09.965 --> 11:11.165
Gross.

11:13.419 --> 11:15.586
The Narnia of partias is still out there

11:15.671 --> 11:17.137
and we're going to find it.

11:17.173 --> 11:20.174
Did you just say "Narnia of partias"?

11:20.226 --> 11:22.226
Do you guys know that, that play "rent"?

11:22.311 --> 11:24.678
Yeah. Like, I don't
understand how they thought

11:24.764 --> 11:27.514
that they just didn't need
to pay rent, like, at all.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.183
I know, it's like, it sucks,

11:29.268 --> 11:31.185
but everybody has to pay rent.

11:31.237 --> 11:32.236
- Yeah.
- Rent?

11:32.321 --> 11:34.188
And also, I could totally be on Broadway.

11:34.273 --> 11:35.272
I'd be like...

11:35.358 --> 11:38.025
- 500, 25...
- (Phone vibrating)

11:38.110 --> 11:39.326
Oh, my God.

11:39.362 --> 11:41.028
You guys, hold on, Trey is calling me.

11:41.113 --> 11:42.112
I'm ways drunk, I can't pick up.

11:42.198 --> 11:43.947
I'm going to decline.

11:44.033 --> 11:44.865
<i>- Oh no.
- (Trey) Abbi?</i>

11:44.950 --> 11:45.866
Oh God.

11:47.203 --> 11:48.502
Hello?

11:48.537 --> 11:50.087
Abbi, I just saw an
Instagram of you at a party

11:50.172 --> 11:51.004
with a drink on your head.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.873
I... it was...

11:52.958 --> 11:55.793
a throwback Thursday pic that I put up.

11:55.878 --> 11:56.710
But it's Friday.

11:56.796 --> 11:58.929
I'm just stupid.

11:59.014 --> 12:00.464
- And I'm in the hospital.
- (Ilana) Beep.

12:00.549 --> 12:02.299
- That's my life machine...
- Beep, beep.

12:02.385 --> 12:03.517
- Going.
- Beep.

12:03.552 --> 12:04.635
Gotta do something.

12:04.720 --> 12:05.719
- Beep.
- I'm hooked up to...

12:05.805 --> 12:07.354
- there's tubes.
- Beep, boop.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.223
My doctor's right here if
you want to talk to him.

12:09.275 --> 12:10.524
Good, hello?

12:10.559 --> 12:12.943
Hello, hello, this is Dr. Rotreiller, MD.

12:13.028 --> 12:14.228
Are you a specialist?

12:14.313 --> 12:17.948
I'm more of a general
jack-of-all-trades style doctor.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.316
What's going on with the tapeworm?

12:19.402 --> 12:21.452
Is it still in her... butt?

12:21.537 --> 12:24.738
It's still in her anus.

12:24.790 --> 12:25.823
(Exhales)

12:25.908 --> 12:29.042
It is crowned and... and breeched.

12:29.078 --> 12:30.461
What do you think her
recovery time is going to be?

12:30.546 --> 12:33.414
We don't know whether it'll
be a few days or a few hours,

12:33.466 --> 12:36.083
but it's gonna... we're
gonna get it out of there.

12:36.135 --> 12:37.584
And it's gonna get gone.

12:37.670 --> 12:38.919
Sorry, no offense, are you a nurse

12:39.004 --> 12:39.920
or are you a real doctor?

12:39.972 --> 12:40.921
What...

12:42.591 --> 12:44.591
I, uh... they're calling me.

12:44.677 --> 12:48.228
I gotta go get the worm... is... taken out.

12:48.264 --> 12:49.680
<i>Call me when you're done, I guess.</i>

12:49.765 --> 12:51.732
<i>- Bye.
- Abbi, all right, bye.</i>

12:55.271 --> 12:56.186
My bad, I'm sorry.

12:57.356 --> 12:59.606
That guy did not sound qualified.

12:59.692 --> 13:00.657
All right, I'm sorry, you guys.

13:00.743 --> 13:01.658
Sorry to make you wait.

13:01.744 --> 13:02.826
Okay.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.278
Ready to fall.

13:04.363 --> 13:05.446
(Guests) Fall away.

13:05.531 --> 13:06.447
Falling.

13:07.616 --> 13:10.167
Ooh, whoa, oh.

13:10.252 --> 13:11.919
(Laughing)

13:11.954 --> 13:13.454
I'm a dentist, not a doctor.

13:13.506 --> 13:15.756
I don't know how to deal
with high-pressure situations.

13:15.791 --> 13:18.125
Don't worry... Lincoln, nothing matters.

13:18.210 --> 13:19.760
Yeah, it's fine.

13:19.795 --> 13:22.179
What just happened?

13:22.264 --> 13:23.630
It's a black Irish goodbye.

13:23.716 --> 13:24.631
He always does it.

13:26.101 --> 13:28.852
Okay, so I just found
out about a rooftop party

13:28.938 --> 13:31.054
a hot sec from here.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.055
This is perfect.

13:32.141 --> 13:33.223
No, you know what?

13:33.309 --> 13:34.308
I think I need to go home.

13:34.393 --> 13:36.226
Trey definitely did not believe that call.

13:36.312 --> 13:38.645
No, dude, he definitely believed you.

13:42.818 --> 13:43.901
All right, I agree.

13:43.986 --> 13:44.952
Yessa!

13:46.372 --> 13:47.821
Also, I love roofs.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.086
Yes, whose party is this, dude?

14:03.172 --> 14:04.922
Who gives a fat wet...

14:05.007 --> 14:05.923

14:06.008 --> 14:07.641
Heads up, whoo!

straight dudes make out.

14:41.176 --> 14:43.293
You never know if you never try,

14:43.379 --> 14:45.512
you never try if you never know, you know?

14:45.548 --> 14:47.347
(Laughing) Yes!

14:47.383 --> 14:48.715

beer, do you want one?

17:53.993 --> 17:55.659
You're always worried
about missing out on life.

17:55.744 --> 17:57.711
You never bother to actually live.

17:57.746 --> 18:00.130

20:06.351 --> 20:07.734
Classic Val.

20:07.769 --> 20:09.269
Hold on, I think my nose ring is here.

20:09.321 --> 20:10.370
Don't touch it!

20:13.652 --> 20:15.018
Morning, Abbi.

20:15.070 --> 20:17.187
Wait, Maria, why are you
wearing a trainer t-shirt?

20:17.239 --> 20:18.822
I am a trainer now.

20:18.857 --> 20:20.073
No...

20:20.158 --> 20:21.191
Way!

20:21.276 --> 20:22.692
Congrats.

20:22.778 --> 20:24.361
Congrats.

20:24.446 --> 20:26.613
How the (Bleep) did that happen?

20:26.698 --> 20:28.031
Kooky girl.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.532
How did that go down?

20:29.618 --> 20:33.370
Well, I always wanted to be a trainer,

20:33.455 --> 20:35.455
so I asked Trey at the party.

20:36.875 --> 20:40.710
We both were a little
drunk, so I was not afraid.

20:40.762 --> 20:43.713
It was like asking to a friend,

20:43.799 --> 20:45.682
- you know, instead of a boss.
- Boss.

20:45.717 --> 20:47.050
- Yeah.
- Here.

20:47.135 --> 20:49.552
You can have my cleaner t-shirt.

20:50.806 --> 20:52.889
I only wore it one day.

20:52.975 --> 20:54.224
Mmm.
