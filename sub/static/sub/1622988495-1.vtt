00:59.998 --> 01:04.837
<i>Ever since I was young, I was
obsessed with the search for perfection.</i>

01:06.974 --> 01:09.439
<i>Probably because
"perfection" was a word</i>

01:09.441 --> 01:12.979
<i>my architecture professors
repeated all the time.</i>

01:14.880 --> 01:17.481
<i>During my early years
as an architect,</i>

01:17.483 --> 01:22.956
<i>I became obsessed with designing beautiful
buildings, proportionally accurate.</i>

01:24.123 --> 01:26.657
But 20 years ago,

01:26.659 --> 01:28.792
I went through a huge crisis

01:28.794 --> 01:32.696
that made me rethink
the meaning of my work.

01:32.698 --> 01:36.234
<i>The uncomfortable truth
is what we call "architecture"</i>

01:36.236 --> 01:38.301
<i>is actually the business
of designing</i>

01:38.303 --> 01:41.505
<i>for the wealthiest one percent
of the population.</i>

01:41.507 --> 01:44.741
It's not only wrong in terms
of social justice,

01:44.743 --> 01:47.711
but it's also a clumsy
business strategy.

01:47.713 --> 01:52.083
<i>Fifteen years ago, we decided to
change the recipients of our projects,</i>

01:52.085 --> 01:55.152
<i>and we traveled to Rwanda
with the goal</i>

01:55.154 --> 01:57.020
<i>of building hospitals.</i>

01:57.022 --> 02:00.223
<i>There we found a maternity clinic
that was making mothers sick</i>

02:00.225 --> 02:05.295
due to faulty design.
Quite a paradox, isn't it?

02:05.297 --> 02:10.101
<i>If we know that the simple view of
nature can radically improve health,</i>

02:10.103 --> 02:15.473
<i>then why not design a hospital where
each family has their own view?</i>

02:15.475 --> 02:21.546
Designing hospitals following
that logic was decisive, but...

02:21.548 --> 02:25.283
helping the actual community
build it with their own hands

02:25.285 --> 02:30.724
was one of the most enriching
experiences of my entire life.

02:32.225 --> 02:33.658
<i>Twenty years ago,</i>

02:33.660 --> 02:36.326
<i>after a serious
personal crisis,</i>

02:36.328 --> 02:39.730
<i>I understood that perfection
in architecture</i>

02:39.732 --> 02:44.368
<i>is not about constructing
beautiful buildings.</i>

02:44.370 --> 02:48.671
<i>I truly believe that
great architecture can heal</i>

02:48.673 --> 02:54.145
as long as it's focused on what's truly
essential and forgets everything else.

02:54.147 --> 02:57.214
Like Antoine de
Saint-Exupéry said,

02:57.216 --> 03:01.117
"Perfection is achieved not when
there is nothing more to add,

03:01.119 --> 03:05.257
but when there is nothing
left to take away."

03:06.591 --> 03:07.758
Thank you.

03:13.232 --> 03:15.635
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

03:29.316 --> 03:31.282
Ciao.

03:31.284 --> 03:33.053
Yeah, yeah, of course.

03:34.786 --> 03:39.390
For Concha, here you are.

03:39.392 --> 03:41.458
<i>Bien, bien, désolé, Monsieur.</i>

03:41.460 --> 03:42.893
You'll have to excuse us.

03:42.895 --> 03:44.395
I'll have to take
Mr. Angust with me,

03:44.397 --> 03:46.664
otherwise he's going
to miss his flight.

03:46.666 --> 03:48.101
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

03:49.802 --> 03:50.936
<i>Allez.</i>

03:54.274 --> 03:55.338
Your car is here.

03:55.340 --> 03:56.776
OK.

04:02.381 --> 04:05.482
Thank you for coming to Paris.
I know you don't like it.

04:05.484 --> 04:08.588
How could I? You don't
even know what the sun is.

04:12.524 --> 04:14.926
Still wearing it, Jeremy?

04:14.928 --> 04:17.327
I can't forget her, Jean.

04:17.329 --> 04:22.766
Well, it's been long enough.
She left you 20 years ago.

04:22.768 --> 04:24.534
Maybe I need
a vacation, some rest.

04:24.536 --> 04:26.036
I've been saying
that for months.

04:26.038 --> 04:28.472
You work too much.
Go out, meet people.

04:28.474 --> 04:29.673
I have to go.

04:29.675 --> 04:33.012
OK.

05:08.348 --> 05:10.183
Excuse me. Hello?

05:11.116 --> 05:12.517
Hello, please?

05:12.519 --> 05:15.786
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you,

05:15.788 --> 05:19.222
but actually no one
is paying any attention to me.

05:19.224 --> 05:21.525
You wouldn't happen to be
heading to the airport?

05:21.527 --> 05:23.594
Well, if the traffic
will let us.

05:23.596 --> 05:27.597
This is so embarrassing, but
I'm about to miss my flight

05:27.599 --> 05:29.633
and there's not
a single free cab.

05:29.635 --> 05:32.138
Do you mind if I catch a ride?

05:33.873 --> 05:35.539
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to bother you.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.840
Come on, get in.

05:36.842 --> 05:37.508
Yeah?

05:37.510 --> 05:38.676
Yeah!

05:38.678 --> 05:40.077
Oh, God, thank you,
thank you!

05:41.748 --> 05:43.113
Get in.
Don't mind him.

05:43.115 --> 05:46.984
Thanks. I'm soaked.

05:46.986 --> 05:48.721
I can see that.

05:56.562 --> 05:59.563
Jeremiasz Angust?

05:59.565 --> 06:02.565
Were you at my conference?

06:02.567 --> 06:08.339
- No. Your name is on that book in your bag.
- Of course.

06:08.341 --> 06:12.743
- And so is your address in Warsaw?
- Yeah, Warsaw.

06:12.745 --> 06:16.947
I'm Texel. I'm Texel Textor.
I'm Dutch.

06:16.949 --> 06:19.315
Wow.

06:19.317 --> 06:22.385
What, are you surprised by my name
or by the fact that I'm Dutch?

06:22.387 --> 06:23.721
Your name.

06:23.723 --> 06:26.390
Yes, kind of odd, I guess.

06:26.392 --> 06:29.325
Yeah, it is. But it has
a nice ring to it.

06:29.327 --> 06:31.395
Well, shit, you're the
first person I've met

06:31.397 --> 06:33.363
that likes my name.

06:33.365 --> 06:37.534
Did you know,
that Textor is.... Shit!

06:37.536 --> 06:39.536
- What happened?
- My suitcase.

06:39.538 --> 06:40.871
You only had that bag
when you got in.

06:40.873 --> 06:42.640
Hey, stop the car, please!

06:42.642 --> 06:44.676
- Why?
- Damn it.

06:44.678 --> 06:46.911
I know where I left it.
It's on the corner where you picked me up.

06:46.913 --> 06:49.746
And my passport is in there.

06:54.353 --> 06:57.654
I put it in the doorway
to protect from the rain.

06:57.656 --> 06:59.222
Are you going
to miss your flight?

06:59.224 --> 07:00.991
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I was cutting it tight.

07:00.993 --> 07:03.226
Okay, look, it's fine.
I'll walk back.

07:03.228 --> 07:04.762
Can you take a taxi?

07:04.764 --> 07:06.900
I spent an hour
looking for a free one.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.477
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

07:31.190 --> 07:33.524
Jeez, he could
have gotten out.

07:33.526 --> 07:36.496
He just lost his tip.

07:45.171 --> 07:46.740
Merci.

08:00.553 --> 08:03.986
Do you want to know
why I was named Texel?

08:03.988 --> 08:06.089
I guess my parents really
liked Texel Island.

08:06.091 --> 08:08.258
It's in Holland.
Do you know it?

08:08.260 --> 08:09.460
I've heard of it, yes.

08:09.462 --> 08:11.227
And my last name is Textor.

08:11.229 --> 08:15.198
And Textor comes from the Latin
"texere", which means to weave.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.967
So it basically means
words woven together.

08:17.969 --> 08:23.306
But, you know, I prefer a more grand
meaning like "the one who weaves text".

08:23.308 --> 08:27.376
- Interesting.
- You know, it's a shame with this last name I'm not a writer.

08:27.378 --> 08:30.515
You can always start.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.017
Do you think so?

08:35.521 --> 08:37.157
We're here.

08:50.669 --> 08:53.037
I have to run.
It was nice meeting you.

08:53.039 --> 08:54.708
Okay.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.811
Hey! Good luck!

09:10.375 --> 09:11.542
Shit.

09:29.309 --> 09:33.510
Hi, Jean. I ran into some problems on my
way to the airport and I missed my flight.

09:33.512 --> 09:35.513
<i>Seriously, you want me to come?</i>

09:35.515 --> 09:39.451
No, no, no. I don't need company
for two hours. I can handle it.

09:40.449 --> 09:40.951
<i>Call me if you need anything.</i>

09:40.953 --> 09:42.452
Yeah, OK, bye.

09:42.454 --> 09:43.889
Enjoy your airport.

09:51.531 --> 09:53.529
Welcome to the VIP lounge, sir.

09:53.531 --> 09:55.198
Thank you.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.603
Thank you.

11:23.989 --> 11:26.390
"Angust did nothing
more than explain

11:26.392 --> 11:29.496
what we had already read in his books.
Disappointing."

11:34.566 --> 11:36.969
We missed our flights.

11:40.571 --> 11:42.875
We just have to wait.

11:45.576 --> 11:48.178
How's your book?

11:48.180 --> 11:50.213
I'm not reading a book.

11:50.215 --> 11:54.853
Oh, yeah, I understand. I also can't
read when there's so many people around.

12:00.258 --> 12:04.595
- And I hate airports. Don't you?
- I'm sorry...

12:04.597 --> 12:06.496
They say you meet
interesting people in airports,

12:06.498 --> 12:09.600
but you know what kind of
people you meet around here?

12:09.602 --> 12:10.870
No.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.340
What kind?

12:16.342 --> 12:19.242
They're all executives
on business trips,

12:19.244 --> 12:23.579
and, like, a business trip is a
complete rejection of a trip itself.

12:23.581 --> 12:27.149
I think they should have called
it commercial displacement.

12:27.151 --> 12:29.819
- Don't you think?
- It's an interesting concept.

12:29.821 --> 12:32.990
Yeah, it is interesting,

12:32.992 --> 12:36.360
even though I'm pretty sure
you're here on a business trip.

12:36.362 --> 12:37.928
Not exactly.

12:37.930 --> 12:39.996
Well, you're definitely
not here on vacation.

12:39.998 --> 12:44.201
The truth is, I don't
really feel like talking.

12:44.203 --> 12:45.836
- How rude.
- What?

12:45.838 --> 12:48.204
I think you're
being pretty rude.

12:48.206 --> 12:51.608
I don't understand you. I brought you
here and I missed my flight because of it.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.276
Yeah, well, I missed mine, too.

12:53.278 --> 12:55.578
And now you're bugging me.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.616
So much hostility.

12:59.451 --> 13:01.385
Who are you?

13:01.387 --> 13:05.588
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Texel.
I'm Texel Textor. I'm Dutch.

13:05.590 --> 13:07.390
And what the hell
do you want from me?

13:07.392 --> 13:09.626
I'm sorry, but talking
isn't forbidden.

13:09.628 --> 13:13.065
I can't stop you from talking,
but you can't force me to respond.

13:16.335 --> 13:21.071
OK, then I guess I'll just
have to tell you about me.

13:21.073 --> 13:23.307
Are you going to make me
leave this lounge?

13:23.309 --> 13:26.742
No, please.

13:26.744 --> 13:28.077
Why are you doing this?

13:28.079 --> 13:29.579
Because I feel like it.

13:29.581 --> 13:31.448
- And I feel like...
- Punching me in the face.

13:31.450 --> 13:32.716
I wasn't going to say....

13:32.718 --> 13:34.784
You don't have to. I can tell.

13:34.786 --> 13:39.823
But by the way, physical
punishment isn't legal,

13:39.825 --> 13:42.525
and punching a woman
on top of that,

13:42.527 --> 13:44.361
now, that's
particularly taboo.

13:44.363 --> 13:47.563
Do you have any higher ambition
than bothering people?

13:47.565 --> 13:49.566
No.

13:49.568 --> 13:51.468
- Well, I do.
- No, you don't.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.169
How do you know?

13:53.171 --> 13:55.639
You look like a businessman,
and earning lots of money

13:55.641 --> 13:57.241
isn't a very high ambition.

13:57.243 --> 14:01.577
I'm not a businessman.
I'm an architect.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.980
Really?

14:02.982 --> 14:04.017
Look around.

14:07.185 --> 14:08.584
This is my work.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.788
Wow!

14:11.256 --> 14:13.122
Are you the architect?

14:13.124 --> 14:14.926
You see that model?

14:30.541 --> 14:33.543
And we are... here?

14:33.545 --> 14:35.982
No, we're here.

14:37.449 --> 14:40.550
Oh... were you
pleased with the result?

14:40.552 --> 14:43.187
Not exactly. It was
a long time ago.

14:43.189 --> 14:46.490
I've polished my
style over the years,

14:46.492 --> 14:51.294
I think the original design had
unnecessary elements, spaces...

14:51.296 --> 14:55.631
Perfection is achieved not when
there is nothing more to add,

14:55.633 --> 14:59.568
but when there's nothing
left to take away.

14:59.570 --> 15:01.571
Are you sure you weren't
at my conference?

15:01.573 --> 15:05.708
Me? No...

15:05.710 --> 15:08.180
Well, I think this
building is incredible.

15:11.517 --> 15:14.318
Hey, let's get a drink.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.587
No, thank you, but I have
a lot of work to do...

15:16.589 --> 15:21.692
Please. Look, I know I bothered you
and I made you miss your flight.

15:21.694 --> 15:25.629
- There's no need.
- Don't make me feel worse. A cocktail?

15:25.631 --> 15:28.201
I'll take that smile as a yes.

15:29.469 --> 15:30.969
Come.

15:39.177 --> 15:42.612
I have a question. Why did
you pick me to harass?

15:42.614 --> 15:45.281
You inspire me.

15:45.283 --> 15:49.151
I think there's a certain
availability about you.

15:49.153 --> 15:51.288
Don't kid yourself.
I'm not available.

15:51.290 --> 15:56.559
Oh, don't get me wrong.
You seem curious about things.

15:56.561 --> 15:58.562
- Curious?
- In fact,

15:58.564 --> 16:01.364
I think you're burning with
desire to know my secret.

16:01.366 --> 16:04.568
And you really think I'm that
interested in hearing about you.

16:04.570 --> 16:06.506
Oh, yeah.

16:09.575 --> 16:13.510
Tell me.. have you
ever killed anyone?

16:13.512 --> 16:15.044
Excuse me?

16:15.046 --> 16:17.149
I killed someone
when I was little.

16:19.517 --> 16:21.050
You're joking now?

16:21.052 --> 16:23.054
I see you're interested
in my stories now.

16:24.522 --> 16:26.823
Perfect.

16:26.825 --> 16:30.660
Then I'm going to ask
you to close your eyes

16:30.662 --> 16:35.031
and visualize the story
I'm about to tell you

16:35.033 --> 16:36.567
in complete detail.

16:36.569 --> 16:39.436
It's a three-part story,
the first disgusting,

16:39.438 --> 16:43.506
the second scary, and the
third one will end with love.

16:43.508 --> 16:46.012
Are you ready?

16:47.546 --> 16:49.545
Yeah, sure.

16:49.547 --> 16:53.719
So I must have been
about 10 years old.

16:55.554 --> 16:57.520
<i>And I was living in the
suburbs of Rotterdam</i>

16:57.522 --> 17:04.260
<i>in a tiny home with my mother,
her husband and our three cats.</i>

17:09.368 --> 17:13.472
<i>I know what you mean.
I grew up in a neighborhood like that.</i>

17:17.508 --> 17:19.508
<i>Always hearing the neighbors.</i>

17:19.510 --> 17:22.044
- No, shit!
- What's wrong?

17:22.046 --> 17:24.447
- What type of building are you imagining?
- Who cares?

17:24.449 --> 17:27.050
You're imagining a building from
when you were a kid, aren't you?

17:27.052 --> 17:29.052
Yeah. Typical
Communist building.

17:29.054 --> 17:32.155
OK, look, it's normal.
When we hear a story,

17:32.157 --> 17:35.291
we use pictures of our own
memories to put an image together.

17:35.293 --> 17:38.227
We basically become like
the architects of the story.

17:38.229 --> 17:39.929
That's a wise observation.

17:39.931 --> 17:42.999
Yeah, but I can assure
you

17:43.001 --> 17:45.768
your building was not
like the one I lived in.

17:45.770 --> 17:48.772
<i>Because I lived in a motorhome</i>

17:48.774 --> 17:52.542
<i>on a campsite way
far out of the city.</i>

17:52.544 --> 17:59.719
<i>Remember I told you that the first
part of my story would be disgusting?</i>

18:01.286 --> 18:05.688
<i>When I was little, food
was always a problem for me.</i>

18:05.690 --> 18:09.659
<i>I couldn't stand many textures and flavors,
and no one in my family could cook,</i>

18:09.661 --> 18:12.861
<i>so the fish was either too rotten
or the meat was really tough</i>

18:12.863 --> 18:19.101
<i>and my mother was cooking all the
time and Fatso finished it all.</i>

18:19.103 --> 18:20.637
Who?

18:20.639 --> 18:23.239
Oh, that's what I used
to call my stepfather,

18:23.241 --> 18:26.744
because he always ate and he
used to make a lot of noise.

18:26.746 --> 18:33.015
<i>It was disgusting. I always used to sit
there in silence. I was a very quiet kid.</i>

18:33.017 --> 18:38.322
Oh, an aside, the three cats
were strays, not pedigree.

18:38.324 --> 18:40.689
I imagined you with glasses.

18:40.691 --> 18:43.392
It's a stereotype.
But yes, I did have glasses.

18:43.394 --> 18:46.396
And with a sad face.

18:46.398 --> 18:51.601
You're right. When a child doesn't
feel love, their face can't hide it.

18:51.603 --> 18:55.005
Nobody loved you?

18:55.007 --> 18:59.442
My mother only ever spoke
to me to tell me to eat.

18:59.444 --> 19:01.378
<i>And I tried, really, I did.</i>

19:01.380 --> 19:03.580
Eat up.

19:03.582 --> 19:06.752
<i>But every time I got to swallowing,
I couldn't get anything down.</i>

19:16.061 --> 19:19.964
Fatso would get up and
slap me across the face.

19:19.966 --> 19:21.966
And your mother never
said anything?

19:21.968 --> 19:25.968
No. She came up with a new
strategy.

19:25.970 --> 19:27.803
<i>Every time I didn't finish
my plate,</i>

19:27.805 --> 19:30.975
<i>I got the job of preparing
the cat's meals.</i>

19:30.977 --> 19:33.810
<i>You know what
they like to eat?</i>

19:33.812 --> 19:36.447
<i>Cans of slimy cat food,</i>

19:36.449 --> 19:41.351
<i>all that leftover meat and sometimes even
rabbit guts mixed together with rice.</i>

19:41.353 --> 19:42.919
Better than getting beat up?

19:42.921 --> 19:44.955
No. In fact, I preferred
the beatings

19:44.957 --> 19:47.790
<i>because I had to prepare all
of that with my own hands.</i>

19:47.792 --> 19:50.963
<i>Otherwise the stupid cats
wouldn't eat it.</i>

19:56.468 --> 19:58.567
Did the new punishment
do any good?

19:58.569 --> 20:03.439
No. In fact, one day,

20:03.441 --> 20:06.677
something unthinkable happened.

20:06.679 --> 20:09.646
<i>The cats were
meowing and meowing,</i>

20:09.648 --> 20:14.484
<i>and they were going
crazy at my feet.</i>

20:14.486 --> 20:20.660
And then, suddenly,
I took a fistful.

20:37.441 --> 20:40.409
- How disgusting.
- Mm-mm.

20:40.411 --> 20:42.011
It was delicious.

20:42.013 --> 20:45.247
I've never tasted
anything so good,

20:45.249 --> 20:48.017
but I was terrified.

20:48.019 --> 20:52.490
I knew that somehow it wasn't
me that wanted to eat it.

20:55.026 --> 20:57.794
It was like an inner enemy
made me do it,

20:57.796 --> 21:04.167
an inner enemy a thousand times
more powerful than a wimp like God.

21:04.169 --> 21:05.968
I don't believe in God.

21:05.970 --> 21:09.973
OK, you're right. There is no
definite proof of God's existence,

21:09.975 --> 21:15.378
but proof of the enemy
within is palpable.

21:15.380 --> 21:21.152
It's what crosses your path every
day, destroying everything worthwhile.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.889
It's what brings out
all your loneliness

21:25.891 --> 21:28.760
and that of all
your friends.

21:30.161 --> 21:33.498
It's what makes you feel
disgusted with yourself.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.839
You know what? There are
doctors for cases like yours.

21:48.380 --> 21:52.618
I'm sorry, I don't want
to bother you anymore.

21:59.658 --> 22:01.727
Hey, wait.

22:05.264 --> 22:08.064
I'm sorry.

22:08.066 --> 22:09.365
Are you hungry?

22:09.367 --> 22:10.801
What?

22:10.803 --> 22:14.804
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

22:14.806 --> 22:19.175
<i>This is a personal call
for Mr. Antonio Carrizosa.</i>

22:19.177 --> 22:22.445
<i>Please, Mr. Carrizosa,
go to Gate F12. Thank you.</i>

22:22.447 --> 22:28.217
Did I miss something or did that story not
mention anything about you murdering someone?

22:28.219 --> 22:29.953
I'm getting to that part.

22:29.955 --> 22:32.322
So that was only
the introduction.

22:32.324 --> 22:34.122
It was absolutely necessary.

22:34.124 --> 22:36.025
Of course.

22:36.027 --> 22:41.130
You see, I was about
12 years old

22:41.132 --> 22:44.935
and there was this girl
in my class named Feline.

22:44.937 --> 22:50.372
She was my only friend.
Nice, charming, funny,

22:50.374 --> 22:53.543
not the smartest in the class,
but she got good grades.

22:53.545 --> 22:55.245
She was the best ballet
dancer there.

22:55.247 --> 23:01.351
Now that, in my school,
was key to popularity.

23:01.353 --> 23:06.922
It was the same with
my school with sports.

23:06.924 --> 23:10.493
<i>Franck Hoffman was the most
popular. Everyone adored him.</i>

23:10.495 --> 23:13.496
- <i>Yeah, you were jealous of him.</i>
- <i>Me? No.</i>

23:13.498 --> 23:17.166
Oh, come on, Angust. I can see it
on your face. You hated the kid.

23:17.168 --> 23:21.037
Not at all. Actually, he was
one of my best friends.

23:21.039 --> 23:23.939
We played on the rugby team
together. He was the captain.

23:23.941 --> 23:25.742
No. Shit.

23:25.744 --> 23:27.177
What's wrong?

23:27.179 --> 23:29.211
What type of school
are you imagining?

23:29.213 --> 23:31.547
No, not again.

23:31.549 --> 23:33.649
<i>You imagine the school
from your childhood,</i>

23:33.651 --> 23:37.053
<i>but I can assure you that our
schools are very different.</i>

23:37.055 --> 23:40.990
<i>We wore uniforms and we'd
never even heard about rugby.</i>

23:40.992 --> 23:47.197
<i>My school was very different.
It was like an old palace.</i>

23:47.199 --> 23:50.166
<i>I'm sure you're familiar
with the Dutch baroque, right?</i>

23:50.168 --> 23:54.570
<i>The thing is everyone adored
Feline. I loved her.</i>

23:54.572 --> 24:00.246
<i>She was my friend, but deep down,
I couldn't stand her perfection.</i>

24:04.048 --> 24:09.419
Oh, bear in mind, I was weak
and sickly looking,

24:09.421 --> 24:12.956
- Do you want some water, sir?
- and always went out of my way to try to please people.

24:12.958 --> 24:14.890
I wanted them to think
I was nice and fun,

24:14.892 --> 24:19.528
but I never managed to.
I'm not like you.

24:19.530 --> 24:21.531
People don't always like me.

24:21.533 --> 24:23.632
Oh, come on. Sure they do.

24:23.634 --> 24:29.438
Your driver was upset before when
he picked me up. I mean, look at me.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.240
What's the problem?

24:32.242 --> 24:35.244
You can't be so politically
correct all the time, Angust.

24:35.246 --> 24:37.216
It's going to get you
in trouble one day.

24:43.322 --> 24:44.790
Mm.

24:48.026 --> 24:50.259
- What?
- Do you have to make so much noise?

24:50.261 --> 24:55.331
Sorry, I don't
have your manners.

24:55.333 --> 25:00.536
The thing is, I started
hating Feline more and more.

25:00.538 --> 25:02.839
You know, she had everything.

25:04.676 --> 25:06.508
<i>A wonderful home,</i>

25:06.510 --> 25:12.482
<i>tons of toys and family that,
you know, really loved her.</i>

25:12.484 --> 25:17.555
<i>But every time I was there, I really felt
the urge to, you know, leave my mark.</i>

25:28.700 --> 25:30.065
<i>And she didn't
stop inviting you?</i>

25:30.067 --> 25:33.171
No! I think she
felt sorry for me.

25:36.208 --> 25:40.575
And then I did it.

25:40.577 --> 25:42.245
Did what?

25:42.247 --> 25:45.581
Well, here comes
the scary part.

25:47.619 --> 25:51.187
<i>One night my mother and Fatso were
arguing and insulting each other</i>

25:51.189 --> 25:54.858
<i>and I was curled up in my bed
trying to escape from the noise,</i>

25:54.860 --> 25:58.027
<i>but I couldn't do that
in the motorhome.</i>

25:58.029 --> 26:03.699
That night, I had
a different goal.

26:03.701 --> 26:06.468
I wanted to eliminate
Feline's perfection.

26:06.470 --> 26:08.103
The inner enemy again?

26:08.105 --> 26:09.406
Exactly.

27:09.334 --> 27:12.738
- Die, die, die, die...
- Die!

27:15.973 --> 27:20.509
Then the next day
the teacher came to the class.

27:20.511 --> 27:27.447
Plie and stretch and hold.

27:27.449 --> 27:30.889
Plie, plie...

27:41.098 --> 27:43.468
What...

27:54.679 --> 27:56.515
What happened to her?

27:59.683 --> 28:01.350
It wasn't your fault.

28:01.352 --> 28:03.053
Of course it was my fault.

28:03.055 --> 28:05.322
She was perfectly fine and then
suddenly out of nowhere,

28:05.324 --> 28:07.623
she died of a heart attack.

28:07.625 --> 28:09.458
If it were that easy
to kill I'm afraid

28:09.460 --> 28:11.894
there wouldn't be so many
people left on the planet.

28:11.896 --> 28:14.130
I have no doubt that Feline's
death was my fault.

28:14.132 --> 28:17.600
There's nothing more powerful than
a spirit driven by conviction.

28:17.602 --> 28:21.771
My hate killed her.
But later on, I lost that power.

28:21.773 --> 28:24.473
So you think you
have superpowers?

28:24.475 --> 28:26.810
Don't make fun of me.

28:26.812 --> 28:32.649
You just told me you killed a little girl
half by praying. What did you expect?

28:32.651 --> 28:37.120
OK, you're right. I'm not some
kind of big time criminal.

28:37.122 --> 28:39.589
I appreciate these
moments of lucidity.

28:39.591 --> 28:42.291
You have to realize I've only
ever killed two people in my life.

28:42.293 --> 28:45.928
That's a mediocre figure.
You need to have higher ambitions.

28:45.930 --> 28:48.130
The demon of guilt
stopped me from going on.

28:48.132 --> 28:49.498
After the second murder?

28:49.500 --> 28:51.135
Yeah.

28:58.142 --> 28:59.775
Are you OK?

28:59.777 --> 29:04.514
I'm tired of all this talk
about demons and murder.

29:04.516 --> 29:07.516
I have a lot of work to do.

29:07.518 --> 29:08.851
OK.

29:08.853 --> 29:12.554
Have a nice evening. Take care.

29:12.556 --> 29:15.727
Yeah, you too.

29:21.199 --> 29:24.934
<i>This is a personal call
for Mr. Yoshihito.</i>

29:24.936 --> 29:31.709
<i>Please go to the gate F42. Your
flight to Frankfurt is about to leave.</i>

33:11.496 --> 33:12.894
Where did you get that knife?

33:12.896 --> 33:15.063
I'm sorry, what knife?

33:15.065 --> 33:17.869
Jesus, Angust, how would
I get a knife in here?

33:58.543 --> 34:01.342
Don't do that.
There are people around.

34:01.344 --> 34:05.749
I'll lower my foot when
you take out your earphones.

34:12.256 --> 34:14.689
Come on Angust, I've got
one more story left,

34:14.691 --> 34:17.094
and I promise you
it's the best.

34:21.498 --> 34:23.799
Who are you?

34:23.801 --> 34:28.504
I'm Texel. Texel Textor
and I'm Dutch.

34:28.506 --> 34:29.806
That's all?

34:29.808 --> 34:31.877
No, I have one more story left.

34:34.279 --> 34:35.678
You lied to me.

34:35.680 --> 34:40.315
I know I talk a lot,
but I never lie.

34:40.317 --> 34:43.752
You were at my conference and you
knew who I was when you got in my car.

34:43.754 --> 34:47.757
- Wow! That's really shocking.
- What is?

34:47.759 --> 34:49.924
How much that girl
looks like me.

34:49.926 --> 34:55.330
Please. She has your same figure.
She's wearing the same socks. It's you.

34:55.332 --> 34:58.602
Look, I swear, I don't
know who that girl is.

35:06.544 --> 35:08.444
- Jean?
- <i>What's up?</i>

35:08.446 --> 35:11.045
Could you check the list of the
people who attended my conference

35:11.047 --> 35:14.283
and see if there is a girl
named Texel Textor?

35:14.285 --> 35:17.053
- Texel with an X?
- <i>Sure, sure, what's it about?</i>

35:17.055 --> 35:19.754
I'll tell you later.
Just do it for me. I'll wait.

35:19.756 --> 35:22.491
God, if you find me,
I will be so scared.

35:22.493 --> 35:25.294
<i>There's no Texel Textor
on the list.</i>

35:25.296 --> 35:30.533
No, hold on a second, Jean.
I'm sending you a photograph.

35:30.535 --> 35:36.205
She's the one on the right. She has
curly blond hair and is in her 20s.

35:36.207 --> 35:37.739
Hey, it's not me.

35:37.741 --> 35:39.375
Definitely she was
at my conference.

35:39.377 --> 35:40.908
<i>Are you okay, Jeremy?</i>

35:40.910 --> 35:43.614
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. Just call me back.

35:47.317 --> 35:52.355
Now, I understand why you're, like,
repeating your name over and over again.

35:52.357 --> 35:57.025
A lie always needs to be repeated
more than the truth to be believed.

35:57.027 --> 36:02.130
Did you know that lying has its own verb
in almost every language in the world?

36:02.132 --> 36:07.736
<i>Mentir, menteur, lügen, klamac...</i>
But telling the truth doesn't.

36:07.738 --> 36:10.772
- To be honest.
- That's not the same.

36:10.774 --> 36:14.777
Being honest is revealing
the truth that was hidden.

36:14.779 --> 36:17.980
If I tell you that
it's seven o'clock right now,

36:17.982 --> 36:20.417
I'm not being honest.
I'm just telling the truth.

36:25.256 --> 36:26.723
Yeah, Jean?

36:26.725 --> 36:28.790
<i>Yeah, the girl you mean
is Alice Myers.</i>

36:28.792 --> 36:33.728
<i>I think it's her. Alice Myers.
Shall I spell it for you?</i>

36:33.730 --> 36:37.065
No. And do you know if they
ask for I.D. at the conference?

36:37.067 --> 36:41.303
<i>Yes, of course. They usually do here.
What's wrong? You OK, Jeremy?</i>

36:41.305 --> 36:44.005
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

36:44.007 --> 36:47.444
If I need anything,
I'll call you. Thank you.

36:52.515 --> 36:56.085
What is your real name?

36:56.087 --> 37:00.522
Texel Textor, should
I spell that for you?

37:00.524 --> 37:02.324
I know your real name now.

37:02.326 --> 37:06.328
Tell me. I would love to know
the name of my twin in Paris.

37:06.330 --> 37:07.529
You already know.

37:07.531 --> 37:10.665
Oh, my God, what a nightmare.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.868
Show me your passport.

37:12.870 --> 37:16.804
No. If you don't believe me,
then that's your problem.

37:16.806 --> 37:20.676
If you really are Texel Textor, you should
have no problem showing me a passport.

37:20.678 --> 37:22.844
Do you want to hear
my last story?

37:22.846 --> 37:25.147
Before when you went
in the men's bathroom

37:25.149 --> 37:30.486
and after that when you put your food
on my chair, what were you after?

37:30.488 --> 37:34.489
Angust, I'm sorry, but....

37:34.491 --> 37:36.491
do you think
I'm hitting on you?

37:36.493 --> 37:38.060
Aren't you?

37:38.062 --> 37:41.031
What?

37:46.738 --> 37:52.674
As you can see,
my name is Texel Textor

37:52.676 --> 37:55.911
and I am Dutch.

37:55.913 --> 37:59.884
And no, I'm not hitting on you.

38:02.520 --> 38:08.156
Although my last story
is about love.

38:08.158 --> 38:12.127
When you finish your story, believe me,
I'll figure out what's going on here.

38:12.129 --> 38:15.464
Mm....

38:15.466 --> 38:17.568
Maybe.

38:21.471 --> 38:24.908
Tell me, what is
your wife like?

38:28.478 --> 38:32.181
Oh, you don't love her anymore.

38:32.183 --> 38:35.585
Of course I do.
Why do you say that?

38:35.587 --> 38:40.790
Because when we love someone, we talk
tirelessly about the object of our love.

38:40.792 --> 38:42.991
Then you must not love
anyone either.

38:42.993 --> 38:45.495
Oh, I love someone
who is sublime.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.996
And why waste your time
bothering a stranger

38:47.998 --> 38:49.730
if you could be with
the object of your love?

38:49.732 --> 38:51.266
They don't love me back.

38:51.268 --> 38:52.667
Use your weapons of seduction.

38:52.669 --> 38:54.502
- I've tried.
- Try again.

38:54.504 --> 38:55.504
It's useless.

38:55.506 --> 38:56.538
What a coward.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.906
This person is dead.

38:58.908 --> 39:02.044
They were very
much alive when we met.

39:02.046 --> 39:03.814
Hm.

39:07.518 --> 39:11.120
Angust, don't look
at me like that.

39:11.122 --> 39:15.824
You're right. The man of your dreams may
be dead, but it's not the end of the world.

39:15.826 --> 39:17.460
I didn't say it was a man.

39:17.462 --> 39:18.527
Was it a woman?

39:18.529 --> 39:20.027
Does it really matter?

39:20.029 --> 39:22.730
Tell me, was it
a man or a woman?

39:22.732 --> 39:28.270
I think there's something a little
bit morbid in that question, Angust.

39:28.272 --> 39:31.272
Please go on.

39:31.274 --> 39:36.111
It was the first time I ever
really felt attracted to someone.

39:36.113 --> 39:41.016
All those years I was
so consumed in myself,

39:41.018 --> 39:47.288
<i>my mother moved in with a Russian guy
and she left Fatso alone and devastated.</i>

39:47.290 --> 39:49.290
<i>And what happened
with the three cats?</i>

39:49.292 --> 39:52.497
<i>They died without
having any children.</i>

39:54.198 --> 39:56.734
<i>And then I decided
to move to Paris.</i>

39:58.502 --> 40:01.536
And that's where I met the most
beautiful person in the universe.

40:01.538 --> 40:03.505
Where in Paris?

40:03.507 --> 40:06.210
Do you like cemeteries, Angust?

40:19.323 --> 40:25.393
<i>There's this grave in Monmartre
Cemetery that I find especially moving.</i>

40:25.395 --> 40:29.897
<i>It's right next to the
tomb of Alexander Dumas.</i>

40:29.899 --> 40:32.900
<i>And there's this statue
on top of a gravestone</i>

40:32.902 --> 40:35.573
<i>that's collapsed with
its face on the ground.</i>

40:38.875 --> 40:42.613
<i>There was this person admiring
it with the exact same face.</i>

40:45.049 --> 40:50.217
<i>Oh, did you pick a man or
a woman for the mental picture?</i>

40:50.219 --> 40:51.721
I won't tell you.

40:51.723 --> 40:54.422
Angust, are you going
to play with me now?

40:54.424 --> 40:56.093
I bet you picked a woman.

41:01.064 --> 41:04.534
<i>One day, I gathered
enough strength to speak.</i>

41:09.372 --> 41:13.944
Did you.... did you act as
the model for the sculpture?

41:16.513 --> 41:18.246
<i>And what did they say?</i>

41:18.248 --> 41:21.016
<i>This person didn't
deign to answer me.</i>

41:21.018 --> 41:23.888
So even still,
I saw that face...

41:25.922 --> 41:28.123
<i>I never recovered
from such an emotion.</i>

41:28.125 --> 41:31.792
It was like
total perfection.

41:31.794 --> 41:34.197
For once I understand you.

41:37.533 --> 41:40.902
<i>That gaze struck me
so deep inside.</i>

41:40.904 --> 41:44.876
<i>You've never been rejected by
the love of your life, Angust.</i>

41:47.343 --> 41:50.645
You're a good-looking man.
You don't know what it's like

41:50.647 --> 41:54.750
to be thirsty and not
have the right to drink.

41:54.752 --> 42:00.556
Water is denied to you for the sheer fact
that you're just not to their liking.

42:00.558 --> 42:03.324
It sounds like a rapist
justifying herself.

42:03.326 --> 42:04.696
Indeed.

42:35.960 --> 42:40.194
<i>You know, there's something really
exciting about following someone.</i>

42:40.196 --> 42:43.098
It's literally like
chasing after a wish.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.933
You should be a writer.

42:44.935 --> 42:47.234
Well, then I should warn you,
here comes the most thrilling part.

42:47.236 --> 42:48.705
Oh.

43:28.310 --> 43:29.777
It can't be true.

43:29.779 --> 43:31.779
And then I dragged
their lifeless body

43:31.781 --> 43:35.218
<i>to a nearby pantheon
where I observed them.</i>

44:55.533 --> 44:58.900
<i>I slid my hand
under their skirt</i>

44:58.902 --> 45:02.006
<i>and I felt their warm skin,
even though it was cold outside.</i>

45:03.540 --> 45:05.876
They were still unconscious?

45:07.745 --> 45:09.046
I thought so.

46:00.964 --> 46:03.732
<i>And the last thing I remember
hearing was someone shout,</i>

46:03.734 --> 46:06.938
"Call an ambulance."

46:09.540 --> 46:11.806
It was the end
of December.

46:11.808 --> 46:14.710
The first winter
snow had fallen.

46:14.712 --> 46:19.281
I was a virgin, but I
don't think they were.

46:19.283 --> 46:23.284
I feel sick to my stomach.
You're insane. You need therapy.

46:23.286 --> 46:27.254
Why would I go to a therapist
when airports exist?

46:27.256 --> 46:29.991
Why the hell are you
telling me all this?

46:29.993 --> 46:31.659
Is that all you have
to say to me?

46:31.661 --> 46:33.761
I also confirmed
the victim was a woman.

46:33.763 --> 46:37.299
Yeah, it was pretty difficult to
keep it a secret for the whole story.

46:37.301 --> 46:42.103
I don't get it. You feel guilty
for having eaten cat food

46:42.105 --> 46:44.705
and you feel no remorse
for something like this?

46:44.707 --> 46:48.844
What I did was flattering. I proved
that I would break the law for her.

46:48.846 --> 46:51.011
What you're saying
is repugnant.

46:51.013 --> 46:54.281
You attacked the first
person you physically desired.

46:54.283 --> 46:56.685
And when you feel like
talking to someone, for me,

46:56.687 --> 46:59.788
for example,
you force yourself on me.

46:59.790 --> 47:02.223
You're incapable
of feeling empathy.

47:02.225 --> 47:06.328
Typical of people who
weren't loved as children.

47:06.330 --> 47:11.500
You see? Now, why would I go to
a therapist when I've got you?

47:11.502 --> 47:12.833
Anyone knows that.

47:12.835 --> 47:15.136
My parents didn't love me.

47:15.138 --> 47:18.739
They abandoned me, and when you
love someone, you don't do that.

47:18.741 --> 47:21.275
Of course, I should feel
sorry for you, but I can't.

47:21.277 --> 47:23.911
I never touched or loved
anyone in all those years.

47:23.913 --> 47:26.748
Surely that type of total
abstinence is romantic.

47:26.750 --> 47:29.317
You're the least romantic
person I can imagine.

47:29.319 --> 47:32.754
Do you want me to finish
telling you my story, Angust?

47:32.756 --> 47:34.623
There's more?

47:34.625 --> 47:36.694
I'd only just begun.

48:17.468 --> 48:20.701
<i>I scoured those
streets of Paris.</i>

48:20.703 --> 48:26.074
Street for street.
Cafe after cafe.

48:26.076 --> 48:31.879
<i>Restaurants, bars,
nightclubs, bakeries,</i>

48:31.881 --> 48:33.883
<i>everything you can imagine.</i>

49:09.520 --> 49:11.752
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

49:11.754 --> 49:14.221
<i>"Why are you so obsessed
with that woman?"</i>

49:14.223 --> 49:16.160
<i>Eventually, you'll
find someone else.</i>

49:18.962 --> 49:24.199
<i>Believe it or not,
I also thought that once.</i>

49:24.201 --> 49:25.770
<i>Stupid.</i>

50:22.524 --> 50:26.862
Then on one day,
two years later,

50:26.864 --> 50:29.800
<i>I'd almost given
up my search.</i>

50:31.268 --> 50:37.541
I was sitting, eating
my most favorite hot dog.

50:59.296 --> 51:05.600
<i>I would have recognized
her among four million women.</i>

51:05.602 --> 51:08.071
<i>Time only made
her more beautiful.</i>

52:19.509 --> 52:21.074
Hey!

52:21.076 --> 52:24.513
Pardon?

52:24.515 --> 52:28.181
I'm sorry, have we met before?

52:28.183 --> 52:30.886
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't think so.

52:30.888 --> 52:32.520
How could she not
recognize you?

52:32.522 --> 52:36.489
I don't know.
I had longer hair.

52:36.491 --> 52:38.393
I was wearing glasses.

52:38.395 --> 52:41.795
Maybe she didn't see me in
the sunlight. Maybe that was it.

52:41.797 --> 52:44.332
Are you sure you
don't remember me?

52:44.334 --> 52:47.937
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm very forgetful.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.940
I imagine we met
through my husband.

52:52.942 --> 52:56.545
We go out to dinner sometimes
with people he knows.

52:56.547 --> 52:59.413
My name is Texel.

52:59.415 --> 53:03.884
Texel Textor, I'm Dutch.

53:03.886 --> 53:08.556
Oh, I think I remember.
Was it in Amsterdam, maybe?

53:08.558 --> 53:10.257
Yeah.

53:10.259 --> 53:14.529
Somehow, she was confusing
me with a Berg's partner.

53:14.531 --> 53:18.900
It was a colleague of her husband's
said they met in Amsterdam once.

53:18.902 --> 53:20.768
- You both live here now?
- Yeah.

53:20.770 --> 53:22.837
That's great!

53:22.839 --> 53:25.505
Maybe you two can come over
for coffee sometime.

53:25.507 --> 53:28.408
Sure. Yeah. Tomorrow?

53:28.410 --> 53:30.478
Tomorrow?

53:30.480 --> 53:32.779
Yeah. Sure.

53:32.781 --> 53:35.250
It would be nice
to see Berg again.

53:35.252 --> 53:36.685
Definitely.

53:36.687 --> 53:38.520
Would five o'clock
be all right?

53:38.522 --> 53:40.422
Five is perfect.

53:40.424 --> 53:43.790
The address is 11 Rue de Rome,

53:43.792 --> 53:46.861
third floor, door on
the right at five o'clock.

53:46.863 --> 53:51.766
11 Rue de Rome,
third floor, door on the right.

53:51.768 --> 53:53.534
Five o'clock. Got it.

53:53.536 --> 53:55.904
OK.

53:55.906 --> 54:01.712
I'll see you tomorrow.
We'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

54:27.169 --> 54:30.904
And I went to my wardrobe,
then I pulled out this outfit

54:30.906 --> 54:33.241
that I kept for that day only.

54:34.777 --> 54:38.145
<i>I almost threw it
in the trash, but</i>

54:38.147 --> 54:44.220
who would have thought that after
two years I found my love again?

54:47.390 --> 54:50.123
<i>Oui, j'arrive. Qui c'est?</i>

54:50.125 --> 54:51.391
It's Texel.

54:51.393 --> 54:52.893
Who?

54:52.895 --> 54:56.100
Texel Textor, you invited
me over yesterday.

54:57.935 --> 54:59.503
Yeah, of course.

55:02.605 --> 55:04.538
- Hi!
- Hi!

55:04.540 --> 55:06.477
Where is Berg?

55:08.544 --> 55:10.645
Berg got held up
at the office.

55:10.647 --> 55:14.214
Yeah. He says he'll
come by a bit later.

55:14.216 --> 55:17.484
You know what it's like
living with a businessman.

55:17.486 --> 55:21.288
Tell me about it.
Come on, please.

55:21.290 --> 55:27.428
Her apartment was very old
fashioned, very bourgeois.

55:27.430 --> 55:31.602
I think the designer must
have been very meticulous.

55:35.471 --> 55:41.308
Um, is your husband
home today?

55:41.310 --> 55:47.013
No, he works afternoons,
so it's just you and me today.

55:47.015 --> 55:49.516
Would you like sugar,
Ms. Textor?

55:49.518 --> 55:54.892
No. And please call me Texel.

56:01.531 --> 56:04.399
Are you named after
Texel Island?

56:04.401 --> 56:05.734
Yeah!

56:05.736 --> 56:08.335
She knew Texel Island.

56:08.337 --> 56:11.105
I told her that I would
love to be her tour guide

56:11.107 --> 56:15.109
the next time
we go there together.

56:15.111 --> 56:17.879
What do you do now?

56:17.881 --> 56:22.884
I work as a painter,
I mainly do jewelry.

56:22.886 --> 56:30.190
<i>I hate that, you know? Small talk.
I just want to cut right to the chase.</i>

56:30.192 --> 56:32.826
Do you like Paris?

56:32.828 --> 56:37.230
Yeah, you know,
more and more...

56:37.232 --> 56:42.770
She said this line about having
Stockholm syndrome in Paris.

56:42.772 --> 56:46.373
I've been living here
for the last seven years.

56:46.375 --> 56:52.547
And I spent half of the time
lying to myself saying I like it.

56:52.549 --> 56:55.616
But I know it's a lie.

56:55.618 --> 57:01.556
It's a kind of Stockholm
syndrome in Paris,

57:01.558 --> 57:04.725
but still Stockholm syndrome.

57:04.727 --> 57:08.495
Having Stockholm
syndrome in Paris.

57:16.473 --> 57:21.241
Stockholm syndrome... in Paris.

57:21.243 --> 57:22.712
Oh, what a notion.

57:32.922 --> 57:37.857
I am so relieved
you haven't forgotten me.

57:37.859 --> 57:41.862
What do you want from me?

57:41.864 --> 57:45.498
I've come here out of love.
I've been looking for you all these years.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.835
Please leave my house.

57:47.837 --> 57:50.774
I haven't loved...

57:51.942 --> 57:55.710
or touched anyone else
all these years.

57:55.712 --> 57:57.777
Please, can I give you a hug?

57:57.779 --> 57:58.612
Get out!

57:58.614 --> 58:00.783
She rejected me.

58:02.986 --> 58:07.754
And then I realized
she wanted revenge.

58:07.756 --> 58:11.893
I'm sorry, I'm not
going to hurt you, OK?

58:11.895 --> 58:17.401
First, tell me your name
and then you can kill me.

58:23.038 --> 58:24.471
Get out!

58:24.473 --> 58:26.440
If you kill me
I'll disappear forever.

58:26.442 --> 58:30.411
You're crazy. Kill yourself
if you want to die.

58:30.413 --> 58:33.480
No, no, I don't
want to die, OK?

58:33.482 --> 58:37.585
I need you to kill me.
I need the story to have an ending.

58:37.587 --> 58:39.053
I don't care what you need.

58:39.055 --> 58:42.022
Oh! That's not
a very nice answer.

58:42.024 --> 58:44.458
What if I helped
you kill me, huh?

58:44.460 --> 58:49.196
I swear I'll do it.
Go ahead.

58:49.198 --> 58:52.435
Do it! Come on!

59:10.520 --> 59:13.724
She died before I could
call her by her name.

59:18.460 --> 59:21.027
I'm sorry.

59:21.029 --> 59:24.598
<i>All these years,
I thought my dream woman</i>

59:24.600 --> 59:28.101
<i>was going to be called
something mediocre...</i>

59:29.839 --> 59:34.975
<i>like Cindy or Raymonde
or Monique, but,</i>

59:34.977 --> 59:41.649
<i>actually, she had
a very charming name.</i>

59:41.651 --> 59:43.120
<i>Isabelle.</i>

59:56.433 --> 1:00:01.335
Just like that,
without even meaning to,

1:00:01.337 --> 1:00:05.640
I had committed a perfect crime.

1:00:05.642 --> 1:00:09.810
No one saw me go in.

1:00:09.812 --> 1:00:13.614
And I must not have
left many fingerprints

1:00:13.616 --> 1:00:17.016
because the proof is

1:00:17.018 --> 1:00:19.189
I'm still free.

1:00:24.527 --> 1:00:26.527
Who told you that?

1:00:26.529 --> 1:00:28.231
What do you mean?

1:01:09.372 --> 1:01:14.674
I'm sorry, Angust.
We're not done yet.

1:01:14.676 --> 1:01:17.046
What is this whole game about?

1:01:18.814 --> 1:01:20.748
You think this is a game?

1:01:20.750 --> 1:01:23.283
Tell me what you know
about Isabelle's disappearance.

1:01:23.285 --> 1:01:27.154
Wow, you know Isabelle?
Now that's what I call a coincidence.

1:01:27.156 --> 1:01:28.755
Stop fucking with me!

1:01:28.757 --> 1:01:31.625
OK. You're right.

1:01:31.627 --> 1:01:34.995
This encounter is by
no means a coincidence.

1:01:34.997 --> 1:01:37.464
Come here as author
of the facts.

1:01:37.466 --> 1:01:42.337
Stop playing with me or I swear I smash
your face in. Tell me you what you know.

1:01:42.339 --> 1:01:45.538
You want to ally yourself
with the enemy.

1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:46.873
You're not the enemy.

1:01:46.875 --> 1:01:49.143
I defend my right
to be the enemy.

1:01:49.145 --> 1:01:51.277
What exactly do you
really want here?

1:01:51.279 --> 1:01:53.279
You still don't know?

1:01:53.281 --> 1:01:55.117
Tell me what.

1:01:57.185 --> 1:01:58.353
To die.

1:01:59.922 --> 1:02:01.288
<i>This
is a personal call</i>

1:02:01.290 --> 1:02:03.891
<i>for Mr. Jeremiasz Angust.</i>

1:02:03.893 --> 1:02:08.163
<i>Please, Mister Angust,
go to the gate. Thank you.</i>

1:02:08.165 --> 1:02:10.297
Someone who knows
my story told you

1:02:10.299 --> 1:02:13.033
that if you came here and told
me all this, I would kill you.

1:02:13.035 --> 1:02:14.400
Too complicated.

1:02:14.402 --> 1:02:16.837
Tell me or I'm not
responsible for my actions.

1:02:16.839 --> 1:02:20.741
Exactly, OK?
It's time for action.

1:02:20.743 --> 1:02:24.112
I just confessed to killing your wife.
What are you going to do about it?

1:02:24.114 --> 1:02:26.647
If you want to die,
go ahead and kill yourself,

1:02:26.649 --> 1:02:30.518
but leave me alone. Isabelle's disappearance
was the worst thing that happened to me.

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.886
To both of us!

1:02:32.888 --> 1:02:37.460
Is that what you really want
from me? To kill you right here?

1:02:41.031 --> 1:02:45.266
[woman on PA <i>Again, this is a personal
call for Mr. Jeremiasz Angust.</i>

1:02:45.268 --> 1:02:48.471
<i>Your flight to Warsaw
is about to leave.</i>

1:02:52.274 --> 1:02:54.540
I'm...

1:02:54.542 --> 1:02:57.111
I'm sorry, OK,
I'm really sorry,

1:02:57.113 --> 1:03:00.346
but you need to help me resolve
this or I have to call the police.

1:03:00.348 --> 1:03:04.284
Go ahead. It'd be my
word against yours.

1:03:04.286 --> 1:03:07.554
I'd like to know the reason
for all this torture.

1:03:07.556 --> 1:03:09.823
I just told you the truth.

1:03:09.825 --> 1:03:11.458
And now you're trying
to convince yourself

1:03:11.460 --> 1:03:14.228
that it wasn't me, so that
you don't have to kill me.

1:03:14.230 --> 1:03:17.897
A young stranger asked me
to take her to the airport.

1:03:17.899 --> 1:03:20.433
Then, after a series of
disgusting confessions,

1:03:20.435 --> 1:03:24.705
this teenager suddenly comes out and
says that years ago she killed my wife.

1:03:24.707 --> 1:03:29.243
I think that anyone would agree that
you've been lying to me all along.

1:03:29.245 --> 1:03:30.844
I'm not a teenager.

1:03:30.846 --> 1:03:34.949
That's enough. My wife
went missing 20 years ago.

1:03:34.951 --> 1:03:36.486
So what?

1:03:38.821 --> 1:03:41.022
You were just a kid.

1:03:41.024 --> 1:03:44.391
<i>This is a personal
call for Miss Texel Textor.</i>

1:03:44.393 --> 1:03:47.328
<i>Please, Miss Textor,
your flight to Warsaw is about to leave.</i>

1:03:47.330 --> 1:03:50.531
The plane is another
good place to kill me.

1:03:50.533 --> 1:03:52.900
- What?
- Yeah.

1:03:52.902 --> 1:03:55.038
We're on the same flight.

1:04:06.381 --> 1:04:11.183
<i>Final call for Mr. Jeremiasz
Angust and Ms. Texel Textor.</i>

1:04:11.185 --> 1:04:13.823
<i>Gate F28 is closing.</i>

1:04:22.497 --> 1:04:24.498
I'm sorry. Good evening.

1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.169
Thanks.

1:04:47.522 --> 1:04:49.526
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

1:05:24.727 --> 1:05:28.431
<i>Cabin crew,
arm flight then cross-check.</i>

1:05:33.301 --> 1:05:36.170
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.</i>

1:05:36.172 --> 1:05:38.739
<i>Firstly, I'd like to welcome
you on board today's flight</i>

1:05:38.741 --> 1:05:41.074
<i>from Paris, Charles de
Gaulle to Warsaw.</i>

1:05:41.076 --> 1:05:44.944
<i>Today's flight will have us cruising
at an altitude of 33,000 feet</i>

1:05:44.946 --> 1:05:49.216
<i>with the wind en route
being fine. We are...</i>

1:05:49.218 --> 1:05:51.518
Hey! Mister, Can I help you?

1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:53.154
I have to get off.

1:05:53.156 --> 1:05:57.324
Mister, please! You need
to sit down. Mister!

1:05:57.326 --> 1:05:59.426
- I have to get off.
- You can't get off.

1:05:59.428 --> 1:06:01.395
I can't take this flight.

1:06:01.397 --> 1:06:03.330
Excuse me, we have shut the door
and begun take-off protocol...

1:06:03.332 --> 1:06:05.332
I can't take this flight.
I have to get off.

1:06:05.334 --> 1:06:06.699
You can't get off right now.

1:06:06.701 --> 1:06:07.935
Excuse me, what's
the problem, sir?

1:06:07.937 --> 1:06:09.569
- Get your hands off.
- Sir.

1:06:09.571 --> 1:06:11.138
You don't have to
touch me, all right?

1:06:11.140 --> 1:06:12.573
I have to get off!

1:06:12.575 --> 1:06:14.611
- You cannot get off...
- Open this door!

1:06:40.435 --> 1:06:44.006
Excuse me, sir,
may I see your boarding pass, please?

1:06:54.017 --> 1:06:55.018
Sir?

1:07:33.489 --> 1:07:36.489
Is my wife dead?

1:07:36.491 --> 1:07:39.726
I see you're interested
in my stories now.

1:07:39.728 --> 1:07:43.797
They're not your stories.
They're mine.

1:07:43.799 --> 1:07:45.100
Ours.

1:07:47.303 --> 1:07:50.504
How's about this time
you tell me your story?

1:07:50.506 --> 1:07:52.705
Tell me where Isabelle is.

1:07:52.707 --> 1:07:54.241
Quid pro quo.

1:07:54.243 --> 1:07:57.476
Tell me your story
and I'll tell you mine.

1:07:57.478 --> 1:07:59.181
What happened to you?

1:08:08.524 --> 1:08:10.759
It must have been in February.

1:08:13.328 --> 1:08:15.797
We had moved
to a new apartment.

1:08:18.468 --> 1:08:20.534
We'd been married
four years

1:08:20.536 --> 1:08:25.472
and we were ready
to start a family.

1:08:25.474 --> 1:08:26.973
Is that it?

1:08:26.975 --> 1:08:28.844
The last one.

1:08:54.504 --> 1:08:58.207
Isabelle had been
absent for weeks.

1:09:01.510 --> 1:09:04.110
You taste like a pizza.

1:09:04.112 --> 1:09:06.512
So what?

1:09:06.514 --> 1:09:08.817
We should keep unpacking.

1:09:21.330 --> 1:09:25.499
Frankly, I was worried.

1:09:25.501 --> 1:09:28.569
We used to have so
much fun together,

1:09:28.571 --> 1:09:32.475
but those days
were far behind us.

1:09:39.747 --> 1:09:42.785
She was distancing
herself from me.

1:09:50.292 --> 1:09:52.392
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

1:09:52.394 --> 1:09:55.795
You don't have to do
anything, Jeremy. Just give me space.

1:09:55.797 --> 1:09:57.297
I am giving you this space.

1:09:57.299 --> 1:09:59.598
- Oh, come on!
- Now you are acting cold.

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:03.503
No, I'm not acting cold.
You can't say that. It's not fair.

1:10:03.505 --> 1:10:06.138
Fair?! There's someone else!

1:10:06.140 --> 1:10:08.308
No! How you got... Ah!

1:10:10.278 --> 1:10:14.216
Yeah! Run away, Jeremy!
You're such a coward!

1:10:39.642 --> 1:10:42.308
<i>It wasn't the first
time we fought like this,</i>

1:10:42.310 --> 1:10:44.246
<i>but somehow it felt different.</i>

1:10:48.283 --> 1:10:51.351
I went back to work.

1:10:51.353 --> 1:10:54.890
<i>I tried to refocus on
my airport expansion project.</i>

1:10:56.125 --> 1:10:57.991
A clear view
of the runway.

1:10:57.993 --> 1:11:00.494
That's what I particularly
want to see in an airport.

1:11:00.496 --> 1:11:05.865
The cars, moving planes,
things in motion.

1:11:05.867 --> 1:11:11.038
And maybe we could change
the size of the windows, no?

1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:13.973
What do you think?

1:11:13.975 --> 1:11:15.777
Jeremy?

1:11:41.437 --> 1:11:45.539
<i>Oui, j'arrive. Qui c'est?</i>

1:11:45.541 --> 1:11:47.744
It's me, Isabelle.

1:11:55.550 --> 1:11:57.486
I wanted to bring
you these flowers.

1:12:00.456 --> 1:12:01.623
OK.

1:12:19.207 --> 1:12:20.777
How are you?

1:12:23.511 --> 1:12:25.547
Would you like
something to drink?

1:12:42.531 --> 1:12:44.832
<i>Then it all
became clear.</i>

1:12:44.834 --> 1:12:48.835
Your love was going to
leave you the next day.

1:12:48.837 --> 1:12:52.041
But why would Isabelle
abandon your perfection?

1:12:54.542 --> 1:12:55.911
My perfection?

1:13:03.785 --> 1:13:07.189
<i>You couldn't bring yourself
to ask about the plane ticket.</i>

1:13:12.493 --> 1:13:14.630
<i>Your fear of failure
won the battle.</i>

1:13:22.505 --> 1:13:24.440
Isabelle...

1:13:30.145 --> 1:13:32.113
I love you.

1:13:34.515 --> 1:13:38.250
Please...

1:13:38.252 --> 1:13:40.152
- Please, Jeremy.
- Yeah. I know.

1:13:40.154 --> 1:13:41.657
You can't do that.

1:13:43.526 --> 1:13:45.624
It's been so long.

1:13:45.626 --> 1:13:48.527
- Isabelle...
- Stop.

1:13:48.529 --> 1:13:52.132
Stop.

1:13:52.134 --> 1:13:53.636
Sorry.

1:13:59.474 --> 1:14:00.942
She rejected you.

1:14:03.545 --> 1:14:05.648
That was the last
time I saw her.

1:14:08.684 --> 1:14:11.187
After several days
of not hearing from her

1:14:14.489 --> 1:14:17.093
I came back to our apartment.

1:14:20.495 --> 1:14:23.297
Isabelle!

1:14:23.299 --> 1:14:28.334
<i>I had hoped to find her home
after her trip to Holland.</i>

1:14:28.336 --> 1:14:30.436
<i>I needed to apologize.</i>

1:14:30.438 --> 1:14:31.573
Isabelle...

1:14:44.519 --> 1:14:46.085
<i>But she never came back.</i>

1:15:00.935 --> 1:15:03.535
Poor thing.

1:15:03.537 --> 1:15:06.975
Tell me, what do you know?

1:15:11.246 --> 1:15:12.715
Are you my daughter?

1:15:14.683 --> 1:15:16.719
Is that what you think?

1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:20.654
You tell me.

1:15:20.656 --> 1:15:26.429
In a certain way, yeah.
I am your daughter.

1:15:28.796 --> 1:15:33.600
I told you right from
the start that I'm Dutch.

1:15:33.602 --> 1:15:37.137
Probably because you always wanted to
believe that I was born in Holland.

1:15:37.139 --> 1:15:38.838
You're driving me crazy.

1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:42.008
I'm driving you crazy?

1:15:42.010 --> 1:15:46.512
I'm sorry. You don't
need any help with that.

1:15:46.514 --> 1:15:49.516
- What do you want?
- Shh.

1:15:49.518 --> 1:15:51.517
Lower your voice.

1:15:51.519 --> 1:15:53.085
Why?

1:15:53.087 --> 1:15:55.623
Because you're still
on the plane.

1:16:15.844 --> 1:16:18.111
Hey.

1:16:18.113 --> 1:16:21.149
Come on, Angust.
Cheer up, enjoy the trip.

1:16:24.486 --> 1:16:28.221
I'm over here.

1:16:28.223 --> 1:16:33.028
I'm feeling rather... good.

1:16:37.064 --> 1:16:39.932
Ask the stewardess
for some coffee.

1:16:39.934 --> 1:16:40.734
Good.

1:16:40.736 --> 1:16:42.802
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:16:42.804 --> 1:16:47.005
Excuse me, ma'am,
I would love a cup of coffee.

1:16:47.007 --> 1:16:48.508
Louder.

1:16:48.510 --> 1:16:51.343
Excuse me, I'd like
a cup of coffee, please.

1:16:51.345 --> 1:16:52.911
Louder.

1:16:52.913 --> 1:16:55.914
Hey! Excuse me, lady!
I'd love a cup of coffee!

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:57.249
Louder.

1:16:57.251 --> 1:16:59.821
Bring me some coffee!

1:17:12.968 --> 1:17:16.203
Why did you tell me
all the stories?

1:17:16.205 --> 1:17:18.170
Because just like you, Jeremy.

1:17:18.172 --> 1:17:22.075
I have a very well-developed
cosmetic sense.

1:17:22.077 --> 1:17:24.811
And I wanted to tell your
story right from the start.

1:17:24.813 --> 1:17:27.312
It all began when you started
to wish that Frank Hoffman,

1:17:27.314 --> 1:17:30.517
the most popular boy
in class, would disappear.

1:17:30.519 --> 1:17:32.518
And your horrible childhood?

1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:35.222
It's the childhood you think I
would have had if I had been born.

1:17:35.224 --> 1:17:37.691
Why would I imagine
you as a monster?

1:17:37.693 --> 1:17:40.259
Because I'm a daughter
worthy of you, Jeremy.

1:17:40.261 --> 1:17:44.329
I would have inherited all of your
sins and all of your violence.

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:46.132
It's not true.

1:17:46.134 --> 1:17:49.138
So you don't remember when you
met Isabelle at the cemetery?

1:17:51.105 --> 1:17:56.642
You dreamed of raping her that
night, it's all still in here.

1:17:56.644 --> 1:17:58.947
What do you want from me?

1:18:07.255 --> 1:18:11.626
Come on, Jeremy!
She didn't love you.

1:18:13.862 --> 1:18:15.161
Isabelle.

1:18:15.163 --> 1:18:16.866
Stop. Stop.

1:18:45.627 --> 1:18:46.660
Wait, wait.

1:18:46.662 --> 1:18:48.527
We can't end this way.

1:18:48.529 --> 1:18:52.932
What are you doing with the knife?
Please don't do that.

1:18:52.934 --> 1:18:56.468
I can't accept this, I just...

1:19:50.024 --> 1:19:51.460
Come on, darling...

1:19:54.362 --> 1:19:55.898
Wake up...

1:20:06.407 --> 1:20:08.076
Come on, don't be lazy.

1:20:11.479 --> 1:20:13.847
Repeat after me.

1:20:13.849 --> 1:20:16.783
I killed what I loved
most in this world.

1:20:16.785 --> 1:20:21.820
I deprived my daughter of the most
wonderful mother in the world.

1:20:21.822 --> 1:20:24.691
Go away. I want
you to disappear.

1:20:24.693 --> 1:20:29.228
After you killed her, you drove
to one of your construction sites.

1:20:29.230 --> 1:20:31.934
You took Isabelle's
body with you.

1:21:27.188 --> 1:21:31.490
<i>You had committed
the perfect crime.</i>

1:21:31.492 --> 1:21:34.160
<i>No one ever found the body,</i>

1:21:34.162 --> 1:21:39.802
and the airport is a tomb
that can't be penetrated.

1:21:51.345 --> 1:21:55.748
I didn't kill Isabelle.
I was madly in love with her.

1:21:55.750 --> 1:21:58.151
Who is talking when you talk?

1:21:58.153 --> 1:21:59.788
You.

1:22:16.604 --> 1:22:17.772
Do it fast.

1:23:46.527 --> 1:23:48.564
<i>I love you, Jeremy.</i>

1:24:38.750 --> 1:24:40.708
You didn't kill your wife.

1:24:40.792 --> 1:24:42.667
You didn't kill your wife.

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:44.750
She left you.

1:24:45.375 --> 1:24:47.708
She is still alive.

1:25:19.086 --> 1:25:21.954
<i>Like Antoine
de Saint-Exupéry said,</i>

1:25:21.956 --> 1:25:26.359
<i>"Perfection is achieved not when
there is nothing more to add.</i>

1:25:26.361 --> 1:25:30.866
<i>But when there is nothing
left to take away."</i>
