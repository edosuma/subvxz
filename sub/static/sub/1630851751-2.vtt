This reminds me of a mechanical

40:22.554 --> 40:24.654
drilling machine of some kind.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.023
<i>[narrator] The backyard
disturbance could be evidence</i>

40:27.025 --> 40:28.892
<i>of an engineering technique</i>

40:28.894 --> 40:31.661
<i>known as horizontal
directional drilling.</i>

40:31.663 --> 40:34.798
You effectively have
a drill head on a long line.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.868
[machine whirring]

40:38.870 --> 40:40.603
<i>[Nick] The clever part
is that you're capable</i>

40:40.605 --> 40:44.140
<i>of stealing
the drill head from afar.</i>

40:44.142 --> 40:45.909
<i>Oftentimes, magnetic sensors</i>

40:45.911 --> 40:49.179
<i>allow the operator to tell
where the drill head is,</i>

40:49.181 --> 40:50.413
<i>but that doesn't tell them</i>

40:50.415 --> 40:52.382
<i>what they're drilling through.</i>

40:52.384 --> 40:55.418
It sounds
like a useful invention.

40:55.420 --> 40:59.522
But if it goes wrong,
it goes really wrong.

40:59.524 --> 41:02.459
<i>[narrator] Sometimes,
the drills cross-bore</i>

41:02.461 --> 41:04.561
<i>cutting through other utilities.</i>

41:04.563 --> 41:07.664
The results can be catastrophic.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.767
<i>[narrator] 2013, Kansas City.</i>

41:10.769 --> 41:14.737
<i>A horizontal drilling
operation hits a gas line.</i>

41:14.739 --> 41:17.774
<i>The resulting explosion
destroys a restaurant</i>

41:17.776 --> 41:20.810
<i>killing one person
and injuring 15 others.</i>

41:22.379 --> 41:24.447
The idea that people are messing

41:24.449 --> 41:27.717
with the earth underneath you
and you are helpless

41:27.719 --> 41:31.554
to do anything
is really disturbing.

41:31.556 --> 41:34.457
<i>[narrator] In Denmark,
Newlan's backyard dig</i>

41:34.459 --> 41:36.493
<i>hits pay dirt.</i>

41:36.495 --> 41:38.228
<i>He unearths a drill,</i>

41:38.230 --> 41:40.663
<i>boring through under his garden.</i>

41:40.665 --> 41:42.465
<i>And the sharp spinning bit</i>

41:42.467 --> 41:45.702
<i>was just inches below his lawn.</i>

41:45.704 --> 41:47.837
<i>If that directional
drill comes out right now,</i>

41:47.839 --> 41:50.240
<i>the results could be disastrous.</i>

41:50.242 --> 41:53.376
Can you imagine being impaled
by a giant drill?

41:53.378 --> 41:55.378
Not a way to go.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.881
This weird sound
could actually be

41:57.883 --> 42:00.049
the last sound
that he ever hears.
