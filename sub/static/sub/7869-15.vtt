WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:06.171
(machine gun firing)

00:09.677 --> 00:10.976
Ah!

00:15.316 --> 00:17.716
(school bell ringing)

00:20.454 --> 00:21.987
(burps)

00:22.089 --> 00:23.622
(whistle blows)

00:23.624 --> 00:25.057
(yells)

00:29.363 --> 00:31.063
(beeping)

00:36.070 --> 00:38.637
(playing the blues)

00:40.474 --> 00:43.108
(playing the blues)

00:43.110 --> 00:45.677
(tires screeching)

00:45.679 --> 00:48.614
D'oh!

01:27.822 --> 01:30.489
Meep, meep.

01:34.161 --> 01:34.626
Meep, meep.

01:34.628 --> 01:38.831
OTTO:
Hey, this was one
of the planets on<i> Star Trek.</i>

01:38.833 --> 01:42.534
It's so hot I want
to wedgie the sun.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.735
I wet my arm-pants.

01:43.737 --> 01:47.506
Children, I hope we all have
a pleasant and orderly day

01:47.508 --> 01:48.740
here at "Satan's Anvil."

01:48.742 --> 01:51.443
No one knows why the early
settlers called it that,

01:51.445 --> 01:52.711
and I suppose we never will.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.214
Now remember to stay
hydrated, and...

01:55.216 --> 01:57.349
(rattling)
Rattlesnake!

01:57.351 --> 01:58.450
(laughing)

01:58.452 --> 02:00.652
Ha! You fall for that
every year, Seymour.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.689
And the one year I didn't, I was
bitten by an actual rattlesnake.

02:03.691 --> 02:07.192
Yes, if I recall, you took
a sick day you did not have.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.727
I was going to
lose my foot.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.663
Of which you have two.
- Mm...

02:11.665 --> 02:12.898
Ah!

02:12.900 --> 02:15.334
(humming)

02:17.204 --> 02:19.605
Greetings,
desert dwellers.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.172
Git out.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.808
The second we let one
trespasser on our land,

02:22.810 --> 02:24.910
then every goldang...
(squeaking)

02:24.912 --> 02:26.145
Aw, for crying out loud,

02:26.147 --> 02:28.647
It's like Grand Central Station
around here.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.349
Now, Delbert, be nice.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.350
He's just a boy.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.153
Oh, sure, first they send a boy,

02:34.155 --> 02:34.753
then a prairie dog,

02:34.755 --> 02:37.723
then they send in them
black helicopters.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.696
(rifles cocking)

02:44.698 --> 02:47.866
Sir, you have won a National
Endowment For The Arts grant

02:47.868 --> 02:48.800
for your scrap-metal sculptures.

02:48.802 --> 02:53.138
You'll have to put that check
in my cold dead hands.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.876
Hmm.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.680
This park's environment
has been preserved

03:01.682 --> 03:06.852
free of invasive species,
except for one-- rock climbers.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.656
Uh, my jaw is not a toe-hold.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.723
But if I reach your summit,

03:11.725 --> 03:14.426
I'll have climbed rangers
on seven continents.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.527
Fine.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.930
(grunting)

03:17.932 --> 03:19.298
(loud snap)

03:19.300 --> 03:20.832
Oh, I sprained my ankle!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.768
(sobbing)
I'm gonna die up here.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.504
Hang on, I'm coming up for you.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.673
Hurry before it gets dark.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.943
This next move is tricky. Yeah.

03:30.945 --> 03:34.246
(grunts)

03:34.248 --> 03:35.781
(hums)

03:35.783 --> 03:37.716
Oh, my God.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.418
The legends are true.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.619
Did you find gold?

03:40.621 --> 03:44.389
Better-- the prospectors
left naughty French postcards.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.792
Whoa, mama!

03:46.794 --> 03:48.927
Bart, this is fool's porn.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.330
I'll take it off your hands.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.664
<i>C'est si bon.</i>

03:52.666 --> 03:54.900
<i>Si bon. Si bon.</i>

03:54.902 --> 03:57.803
And... remorse.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.460
(bird squawking)

04:21.462 --> 04:25.931
"While beautiful, the desert
also harbors hidden dangers:

04:25.933 --> 04:29.935
"cacti, poisonous snakes,
and most deadly of all...

04:29.937 --> 04:32.471
Scorpions!"

04:32.473 --> 04:33.905
(whimpering)

04:33.907 --> 04:35.741
(yelling)

04:35.743 --> 04:37.376
(gasps, curious grunt)

04:37.378 --> 04:41.847
They calm down when they're near
the Springfield Silvertongues.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.049
Hmm.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.585
(gasps)
Now they're aggressive again.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.819
I'm sure there's a correlation,

04:47.821 --> 04:52.257
but could there be a...
causation?!

04:56.764 --> 05:00.399
These flowers saved me
from a terrible fate--

05:00.401 --> 05:03.335
not getting an "A" on
my next science project.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.336
(laughs)

05:04.338 --> 05:05.370
Lisa, we have to go.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.073
Milhouse found a hippie
skeleton and he's freaking out.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.309
Never get off the bus!

05:10.311 --> 05:12.511
Never get off the bus!

05:14.548 --> 05:17.949
Check it out! Something
pathetic's going on.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.919
You can't throw me out!
I'm not dead yet!

05:20.921 --> 05:21.853
That's the deal, man!

05:21.855 --> 05:24.923
I'm sorry, Abe,
but you're just too cranky.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.925
I got a right to be cranky.

05:26.927 --> 05:30.662
The food stinks and the TV's
only got one channel.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.064
That's a fish tank.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.598
You're a fish tank.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.033
That is so hurtful.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.769
(sobbing)
I wish I was a fish tank.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.672
Then I could filter
out his nasty words.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.841
Call me a fish tank...

05:42.843 --> 05:44.409
Just go, Abe.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.811
That doesn't seem fair--

05:45.813 --> 05:48.847
they won't let him escape,
then they kick him out.

05:48.849 --> 05:49.915
I wonder where he'll go.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.017
Either the grave or
somewhere much worse.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.420
(sputtering)
Sour cream and chives?

05:55.422 --> 05:57.622
In my day,
all we put on potatoes

05:57.624 --> 06:00.425
was pine needles
and barber hair.

06:00.427 --> 06:01.093
I hate this century.

06:01.095 --> 06:06.431
Okay, we're going to take turns
having Grampa as a roommate.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.666
Who wants to go first?

06:07.668 --> 06:09.401
(baby girl's voice):
Me! Me!

06:09.403 --> 06:12.971
I want him every night,
forever and ever.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.941
'Cause I love my...
(muffled)

06:16.777 --> 06:19.878
Nose in a funny book,
how rude.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.780
Ain't you never heard
of conversation?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.548
(sighs)
Fine.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.750
How's it going?

06:24.752 --> 06:25.384
Terrible.

06:25.386 --> 06:28.053
I got this new roommate
and he won't stop yapping.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.022
Here's an experiment
for you:

06:31.024 --> 06:34.893
Find a man who wants
to marry a lady poindexter.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.094
(laughs)

06:36.096 --> 06:37.629
MARGE:
Homie...

06:37.631 --> 06:39.564
Hey, you call that
making love?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.067
Homer, I told you he
wouldn't sleep through it.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.437
In my day, women
didn't make a sound.

06:46.140 --> 06:51.977
LISA: This calls for some
Springfield Silvertongue.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.615
Dad, look.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.083
This essence
of a wildflower

06:58.085 --> 07:00.986
makes these angry
scorpions docile.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.187
That's great, honey.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.123
If you were a boy,
you'd be a scientist.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.124
GRAMPA:
Back off, you mutt.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.260
Or I'll make dog-head
soup out of you.

07:08.262 --> 07:14.900
Hmm, if it works on nasty
scorpions, then maybe...

07:14.902 --> 07:18.737
it'll work on nasty stains.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.074
It does.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.777
(grunts)

07:25.779 --> 07:30.182
And there's something else
it might be good for.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.151
(noisy chewing and swallowing)

07:34.555 --> 07:35.987
Why are you guys
eating so fast?

07:35.989 --> 07:39.758
Trying to get out of here
before Grampa wakes up.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.861
(footsteps thudding,
Grampa muttering)

07:42.863 --> 07:43.829
That's him!

07:43.831 --> 07:45.030
Mom, quick, our lunches!

07:45.032 --> 07:47.065
Go! Save yourselves!

07:47.067 --> 07:48.200
(gasps)

07:48.202 --> 07:51.670
Good morning, family.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.737
It's such a beautiful day,

07:52.739 --> 07:55.507
I thought I'd take my little
friend here for a walk.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.843
Abe, are you
feeling all right?

07:57.845 --> 07:58.743
Never better.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.580
The sun is shining, there's
a spring in my slippers

08:01.582 --> 08:07.018
and my wonderful son woke me up
with a delicious cup of coffee.

08:07.020 --> 08:07.986
Hmm...

08:07.988 --> 08:13.525
Dad, is there anything
unusual in Grampa's coffee?

08:13.527 --> 08:14.125
Uh, you look tense.

08:14.127 --> 08:18.697
Let's discuss this over a cup
of Grampa's coffee.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.566
(shuddering giddily)

08:27.241 --> 08:28.240
Here you go, champ.

08:28.242 --> 08:31.109
Go buy yourself some
rock-and-roll records.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.711
To the antique store.

08:32.713 --> 08:33.712
(humming tune)

08:33.714 --> 08:36.515
Now, what can I do for you?

08:36.517 --> 08:37.983
Eat something green?

08:37.985 --> 08:39.784
Vote for someone brown?

08:39.786 --> 08:42.888
Dad, I know what you did.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.155
(Homer screams)
(doorknob rattling)

08:44.157 --> 08:47.225
And I locked the back door.
HOMER: D'oh!

08:47.628 --> 08:50.929
...and that's why you're
acting so sweet and kind.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.598
Because Dad drugged you.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.170
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
(laughing)

08:59.172 --> 09:01.273
Your kisses feel
like raw liver.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.174
But it's not
real happiness.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.344
It's just because
of an untested drug.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.546
So what?

09:07.548 --> 09:09.180
There are no
guarantees in life.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.750
We don't know if this...

09:11.752 --> 09:13.585
knife is safe.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.554
Turns out it's not.

09:15.556 --> 09:20.625
The point is, when I'm cranky,
nobody likes me, sweet pea.

09:20.627 --> 09:25.196
Let me live as a happy man
for my remaining 30 years.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.933
Come on, come on,
make with the laffy juice.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.869
I want to take Grampa to have
his belly button pierced.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.237
I could hang
my Purple Heart from it.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.974
♪ Ya-da-dee-dee-dee,
la-da-da-da-da-da-da... ♪

09:35.976 --> 09:40.011
♪ Ya-da-dee-dee... ♪
♪ Do-do-do,
do-do-do-do... ♪

09:41.048 --> 09:45.183
It was wrong
of me to play goddess.

10:00.834 --> 10:05.670
Everything everyone just said
is either obvious or wrong.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.339
Homer, do something
about your dad.

10:07.341 --> 10:10.842
He's casting a pall over this
grim dungeon full of losers.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.110
Pfft! Dungeon?!

10:12.112 --> 10:14.212
We can leave
anytime we want.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.382
Homer, why don't you just make
some more of the serum yourself?

10:17.384 --> 10:21.786
Oh, because Lisa won't tell
me what flower it's from.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.754
Excuse me...

10:22.756 --> 10:24.823
My name is Walther Hotenhoffer

10:24.825 --> 10:27.225
and I'm in
the pharmaceutical business.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.827
I was wondering
when that guy

10:28.829 --> 10:31.196
was gonna state his
name and occupation.

10:31.198 --> 10:31.930
Quiet!

10:31.932 --> 10:33.965
Sir, has your daughter
found a drug

10:33.967 --> 10:37.268
that renders old people
tolerable to us normals?

10:37.270 --> 10:40.171
Yeah, but Lisa won't
tell me how to make it.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.640
Lisa is irrelevant.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.907
You'd better elaborate.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.677
All I need is one
drop of extract,

10:45.679 --> 10:48.346
and I can synthesize
the drug at my plant.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.716
But where do I find
that drop?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.852
<i>Nein...</i>

10:53.854 --> 10:54.919
<i>Nein...</i>

10:54.921 --> 10:56.121
<i>Nein...</i>

10:56.123 --> 10:57.188
<i>Nein...</i>

10:57.190 --> 10:58.790
Aha!

10:59.860 --> 11:01.893
Not so fast, Fritz.

11:01.895 --> 11:05.830
Before you waltz off
with my grampa grease,
I want to know--

11:05.832 --> 11:09.000
what did you do
during the war?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.702
World War II?

11:10.704 --> 11:11.302
I wasn't born yet.

11:11.304 --> 11:16.107
Funny how many Germans
say that these days.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.178
(humming tune)

11:21.081 --> 11:22.414
Hmm?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.816
(grunts)

11:27.854 --> 11:29.287
(panting)

11:31.458 --> 11:33.191
(Homer groans)

11:33.193 --> 11:35.160
WALTHER:
From that one droplet,

11:35.162 --> 11:38.196
I have synthesized
50 different compounds.

11:38.198 --> 11:42.033
Please identify the one
that is<i> ausgezeichnet.</i>

11:42.035 --> 11:44.202
Nothing. Nothing.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.437
Can't feel my fingers.

11:45.439 --> 11:46.971
Feel 'em too much.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.173
Erection.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.174
Derection.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.009
I smell music.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.510
Oh, this'll never work.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.313
But when you're doing it
with people you love,

11:55.315 --> 11:58.149
you just can't help smiling.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.085
(both gasp)
<i>Jawohl.</i>

12:00.087 --> 12:01.886
I've isolated the molecule.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.221
(laughing)
Nerd.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.790
Now we test him.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.159
"How do you feel about
the high salaries

12:08.161 --> 12:10.495
of today's
baseball players?"

12:10.497 --> 12:13.198
Oh, don't get me
started on that one.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.134
They're just plain better
than the greats of my day.

12:16.136 --> 12:20.438
God bless them, and their
refusal to learn English.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.340
(laughing)

12:23.110 --> 12:23.775
Huh?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.777
This one didn't
make me feel anything.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.180
(howling):
D'oh!

12:30.784 --> 12:32.884
These are my "Suitcase Suzies,"

12:32.886 --> 12:35.386
who will use their beauty
and free giveaways

12:35.388 --> 12:38.857
to make sure our drug
is prescribed.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.225
Cool.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.092
Are they robots?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.995
No, robots can develop
human feelings.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.265
We're graduates
of Arizona State.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.801
We scoop them up
by the sorority.

12:49.803 --> 12:54.239
Uh... this is
the nerd fraternity.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.375
Drop them in research.

12:58.245 --> 12:58.777
Nice.

12:58.779 --> 13:03.014
Thank you for the tour
of your factory, Mr. Wonka.

13:03.016 --> 13:06.050
I am not Willy Wonka.

13:06.052 --> 13:06.451
No, no.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.887
You're Augustus Gloop,
the fat German boy.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.157
<i>Ja,</i> it is true, I am Gloop.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.527
Being stuck in that tube
changed me in so many ways.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.831
Gentlemen, we've been doing
a lot of funny things today,

13:19.833 --> 13:21.466
but now I must be scary.

13:21.468 --> 13:25.303
Go ahead.
Here is the prototype
of our pill.

13:25.305 --> 13:29.140
Grampapa, no one but you
should take this drug

13:29.142 --> 13:31.476
until it has been through
rigorous trials.

13:31.478 --> 13:35.013
Be careful-- if the wrong
hands got hold of it,

13:35.015 --> 13:36.314
a fortune could be made

13:36.316 --> 13:38.883
by selling this drug
on the black market.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.886
Hmm... wrong hands, eh?

13:41.888 --> 13:43.922
That's your cue, boys.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.790
(smug chuckling)

13:46.893 --> 13:48.960
You sell drugs.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.528
Why can't you
dress like that?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.531
Because I use them,
too, idiot.

13:59.873 --> 14:03.608
MRS. SKINNER:
No wonder you've still
got pimples at your age.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.577
You got all this
candy in your desk.

14:05.579 --> 14:08.313
They're Tums,
for my acid reflux.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.515
Even your acid wants out of you.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.218
(knocking)

14:13.220 --> 14:15.887
I got something to
stuff in that old bag.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.155
(grunts)

14:20.393 --> 14:22.393
Accursed tide.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.963
Flee from my wrath.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.665
No! I've been moistened!

14:27.667 --> 14:31.336
I've got some junk to put
a smile on that corpse.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.212
(chuckles)

14:44.384 --> 14:45.516
(chuckles)

14:45.518 --> 14:46.551
Don't player hate.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.619
I'm just a businessboy.

14:47.621 --> 14:51.089
All right, Bart.
What are you up to now?

15:05.438 --> 15:08.373
Now that's what
I call a fishing trip.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.109
(gasps)
That's what I was
gonna call it.

15:11.111 --> 15:11.576
(laughing)

15:11.578 --> 15:15.513
Wait, I can't go in there
grinning like a Swede on payday.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.148
It'll rile up poor Lisa

15:17.150 --> 15:20.118
if she knows I'm still
popping that smiley-pill.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.453
Oh, yeah-- you better
"grump it up."

15:22.455 --> 15:24.489
(clearing throat)

15:26.493 --> 15:29.360
(mumbling)

15:34.167 --> 15:36.134
Three dollars for
a cup of coffee?!

15:36.136 --> 15:40.271
In my day it cost you
a dime and they gave
you back a quarter.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.340
And another thing-- the, uh...

15:42.342 --> 15:45.576
It's okay, Grampa--
you don't have to act grumpy.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.744
I know you're
taking the drug,

15:46.746 --> 15:49.013
and I don't mind,
'cause you're happy.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.049
Oh! Thanks, sweetie.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.984
I'm sorry I was so stubborn.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.686
I hope you're not mad.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.120
Oh, I ain't mad,

15:56.122 --> 15:58.022
and I never will be again--

15:58.024 --> 16:01.592
thanks to your
wonderful, wonderful...

16:01.594 --> 16:02.560
(all screaming)

16:02.562 --> 16:09.534
Let me finish: thanks to your
wonderful, wonderful drug.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.345
(gasps) It happened
to the scorpions, too.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.580
The flower essence
must have the side effect

16:22.582 --> 16:26.050
of lubricating the eye sockets
to the point of popping.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.652
More saline, please.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.355
At some point, I think
we should see a doctor.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.691
No, it's cool-- it's like
we got our own monster.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.593
Your grandfather
is not a monster.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.628
Now, let's chain him
in the basement

16:37.630 --> 16:39.397
until the circus
comes to town.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.131
Sounds good.

16:40.133 --> 16:44.168
At least no one else
has taken this drug.

16:44.170 --> 16:44.802
(loud gulp)

16:44.804 --> 16:47.538
Bart, why are you
tugging on your collar?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.774
It better be tonsillitis.

16:49.776 --> 16:50.641
Well, actually...

16:50.643 --> 16:55.680
I may have accidentally traded a
few of those pills for money...

16:55.682 --> 16:56.447
(all gasping)

16:56.449 --> 16:58.249
Which I may have already spent,

16:58.251 --> 17:01.285
ironically,
on these novelty eyeglasses.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.788
Howdy, handsome.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.423
Look!

17:12.766 --> 17:15.066
Ooh! (laughs)

17:20.073 --> 17:21.272
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.273
Who loves Mommy's eyeballs?

17:22.275 --> 17:25.176
Oh, there's a kitty
gonna sleep good tonight.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.011
Yes, you are.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.718
So, I guess we're all
in the same boat, huh?

17:33.720 --> 17:34.852
<i>Nein, nein.</i>

17:34.854 --> 17:37.522
My boat is me
and hundreds of lawyers.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.224
Your boat has you
and a lot of people

17:40.226 --> 17:41.459
with their eyes falling out.

17:41.461 --> 17:45.129
Walther, when a man puts
something on a Frisbee,

17:45.131 --> 17:46.798
he should stand by it.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.266
See?

17:48.268 --> 17:48.833
You are right.

17:48.835 --> 17:54.439
As always, the Frisbee is
the mirror to the soul.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.274
Mr. Hotenhoffer,
there's a mob outside.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.609
An angry mob?

17:58.611 --> 18:00.144
No, a cheerful mob.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.914
I'd like to have just one day

18:02.916 --> 18:06.150
when I don't put
a gun to my head.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.518
(cheering)

18:09.456 --> 18:11.889
Now, I ain't much
for speeches...

18:11.891 --> 18:13.858
(popping)

18:13.860 --> 18:17.228
But we sure do appreciate
what you done for us,

18:17.230 --> 18:22.333
and, uh, we were just hoping
we could get more of that drug.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.236
Lots more.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.337
(cheering)

18:26.339 --> 18:29.540
Those poor googly-eyed fools.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.342
I cannot exploit them like this.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.679
I will have to be content
exploiting their fear

18:34.681 --> 18:36.747
of losing hair and penis.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.350
I will destroy the drug.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.352
(crowd jeering)
What? Well, I never...

18:41.354 --> 18:44.355
Walther, let's
not be so hasty.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.357
Who would begrudge
them a few years

18:46.359 --> 18:48.693
of shambling, dope-fogged,
into the grave?

18:48.695 --> 18:52.897
Besides, our generation's got
everything under control.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.732
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:54.734 --> 18:57.368
I was supposed to be
drunk an hour ago.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.270
To Moe's.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.540
Flat tires?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.375
No problem.

19:05.879 --> 19:06.444
Oh!

19:06.446 --> 19:08.746
Homer, use your head.
Just buy a new car.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.815
Great idea, but I don't
have any money.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.518
You could take out a loan
with your house as collateral.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.754
And I wouldn't have to pay it
back for three more years.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.257
What are the odds
of that much time happening?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.626
Pretty close
to zero, I'd say.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.693
Problem solved.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.530
Generation awesome
does it again.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.665
Boo-ya!
Oh, yes!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.834
All right,
you googly-eyed geezers,

19:29.836 --> 19:33.371
turn up your hearing aids--
I've got something to say.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.438
(feedback squealing)

19:34.440 --> 19:37.642
Together, we survived the
Depression, won a few wars

19:37.644 --> 19:39.277
and put a man on the moon.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.780
In fact, the only mistake
our generation made

19:42.782 --> 19:45.249
was creating that generation.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.017
(all cheering and laughing)

19:46.019 --> 19:48.653
If we want to set
these bumblers straight,

19:48.655 --> 19:51.989
it's going to take all the
crankiness we can muster.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.793
So put down those pills,
pop in your eyeballs

19:55.795 --> 19:58.429
and "upside-down" them smiles.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.797
(cheering)

19:59.799 --> 20:02.633
Let's do as he says.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.237
(chuckles)

20:14.581 --> 20:16.280
Wow, their "can-do"

20:16.282 --> 20:20.618
will bail out our
"won't-try" every time.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.820
So I guess the lesson here is...

20:22.822 --> 20:25.790
If you go on a field trip,
don't break off from the group.

20:25.792 --> 20:29.727
And if you are a fat little boy
in a chocolate factory,

20:29.729 --> 20:32.029
never try to drink
from the river.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.231
The tube.

20:33.233 --> 20:33.764
My God.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.901
Every night I see the tube.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.485
(audience murmuring)

21:27.487 --> 21:28.686
Shh!
