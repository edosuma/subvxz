00:23.107 --> 00:26.025
To this

00:26.110 --> 00:29.362
Small, little, not too big, little, homey

00:29.446 --> 00:32.824
Nice, little, quaint, little, always kindly

00:32.950 --> 00:36.119
Old New England town

00:36.328 --> 00:38.371
Welcome

00:38.789 --> 00:43.042
If you're new to the place
And feeling uneasy

00:43.127 --> 00:44.377
Fret not a bit

00:44.461 --> 00:49.632
In this always friendly
old New England town

00:50.342 --> 00:55.680
Welcome

00:55.973 --> 00:59.517
To our family picnic

00:59.643 --> 01:03.146
July Fourth picnic

01:03.981 --> 01:09.485
Independence Day

01:12.322 --> 01:13.489
Aunt Sarah!

01:13.574 --> 01:15.450
Will we see you at the picnic
the day after tomorrow?

01:15.826 --> 01:16.909
Of course!

01:16.994 --> 01:19.537
My precious kitties
love the Fourth of July.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.624
Whether next of kin
or next-door neighbour

01:23.709 --> 01:27.670
Happily, we pool our labour
to give our town a new face

01:28.756 --> 01:30.423
A nifty new look!

01:30.507 --> 01:33.509
A red, white, and a blue look!

01:33.635 --> 01:37.388
And when we're done,
you'll never know the place

01:38.432 --> 01:41.142
At our family picnic

01:41.226 --> 01:43.895
July Fourth picnic

01:43.979 --> 01:46.564
Independence

01:46.857 --> 01:48.232
Day

01:51.487 --> 01:53.488
There's a buzzing in the air

01:53.572 --> 01:56.032
Children running everywhere

01:56.408 --> 01:58.701
As all of us prepare

01:58.786 --> 02:01.454
For that once-a-year, wonderful day

02:01.538 --> 02:03.539
And our spirits are so high

02:03.832 --> 02:06.375
Feels like Christmas in July

02:06.710 --> 02:08.836
As we pray the hours fly

02:08.920 --> 02:10.880
To that star-spangled

02:10.964 --> 02:15.092
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful day

02:18.472 --> 02:21.182
We can hardly wait
to bathe and dress up

02:21.266 --> 02:23.518
We love picnics, we confess, yup

02:23.602 --> 02:26.062
With Darling and with Jim Dear

02:26.313 --> 02:30.733
We've made a home
from which we'll never roam

02:30.984 --> 02:32.068
Why would we

02:32.194 --> 02:35.530
When we're so contented here?

02:36.114 --> 02:38.199
In this fine, little, not too

02:39.117 --> 02:40.743
Big, little, cosy

02:41.620 --> 02:43.746
Warm, little, swell, little

02:44.540 --> 02:46.707
Always loving

02:46.875 --> 02:50.837
Old New England home

02:51.213 --> 02:53.339
In our small, little, not too big

02:53.423 --> 02:55.591
Little, homey, nice, little, quaint, little

02:55.676 --> 02:56.968
Always friendly

02:57.052 --> 03:01.472
Old New England town

03:02.349 --> 03:10.982
Welcome

03:11.733 --> 03:12.984
Welcome!

03:14.111 --> 03:15.778
All right, time for a bath!

03:15.863 --> 03:17.446
The water's hot.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.284
Oh, excellent! I love getting a bath.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.954
It makes my fur so silky smooth.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.330
Yeah!

03:26.456 --> 03:27.832
-Me first!
-No, me first!

03:27.958 --> 03:29.667
No, not you! Wait a minute!

03:31.128 --> 03:32.336
I hate baths.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.255
Just the same, Scamp,

03:34.590 --> 03:36.299
when you live in a house,
you need to be clean.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.467
Well, then I'm glad I'm a wild dog.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.976
Scamp, you know you're
not supposed to climb

03:47.102 --> 03:48.102
on the furniture.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.480
Now get down from there
before you break something.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.358
Hey, let's do some dog stuff, huh, Pop?

03:54.610 --> 03:57.820
You know, dig up bones, rip up flowers,

03:58.030 --> 03:59.447
chase cats!

04:00.365 --> 04:02.158
Scamp, come on now.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.327
You're gonna make a mess.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.329
-Got it!
-Dad!

04:13.003 --> 04:14.045
Tramp?

04:14.171 --> 04:16.839
I hope you're not making
a mess in there.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.009
All right, whirlwind, time to settle down.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.012
Why don't you go play with Junior?

04:29.519 --> 04:30.895
Scamp play!

04:33.190 --> 04:34.357
Scamp!

04:36.026 --> 04:38.569
Look what you did to my favourite hat.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.279
If I've told you once,

04:40.364 --> 04:43.532
I've told you a thousand times. No!

04:46.203 --> 04:47.495
Let's see if you
can behave long enough

04:47.579 --> 04:49.246
for me to give you a bath.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.207
Bad Scamp!

04:52.876 --> 04:54.710
Scamp, stop squirming.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.881
Bad Scamp! Bad, bad, bad Scamp!

05:02.719 --> 05:05.096
Well, it's about time you settled down.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.306
There. All done.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.432
Scamp!

05:09.351 --> 05:10.685
Play ball!

05:12.729 --> 05:14.438
Hey, come back here!

05:16.233 --> 05:18.067
Scamp, catch the ball!

05:20.904 --> 05:21.946
Come back here now!

05:24.658 --> 05:26.575
No, no, no, no, no, no!

05:27.285 --> 05:28.744
Yay! Yay!

05:30.580 --> 05:31.998
Scamp! Scamp!

05:35.752 --> 05:38.254
-Play ball!
-Scamp! Oh, no!

05:38.588 --> 05:39.922
What a mess!

05:41.425 --> 05:42.758
This time, you've gone too far!

05:43.635 --> 05:45.636
You've left me no choice.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.810
Some dogs just have
to learn the hard way.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.312
Maybe chaining you up
will teach you a lesson.

05:57.441 --> 06:01.360
I'm sorry, pal, but I just
don't know what else to do.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.033
-Serves him right.
-Simply incorrigible.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.534
He brought this on himself.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.870
Now we'll need another bath.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.663
-Me first!
-No, me first!

06:12.789 --> 06:14.123
Not you first!

06:23.133 --> 06:24.133
Tramp?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.852
Best thing Jim Dear
could have done for our boy,

06:34.978 --> 06:36.395
chainin' him up.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.565
Tramp, he's never
been chained up before.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.525
He's just a pup.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.029
He has to learn to live
by the rules of the house.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.740
Firm discipline moulds a pup into a dog.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.826
You turned out pretty good.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.204
Yeah, Pidge, but I found you.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.083
And if it weren't for you,
I'd have wound up in the pound.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.668
I'm just trying to protect him.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.879
He'll understand someday.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.842
Maybe he needs to understand today.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.315
I thought you might be hungry.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.071
I'm sorry, pal.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.573
You're just gonna have
to shape up a little, that's all.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.326
I always get blamed for everything.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.454
Sometimes it's hard
bein' part of a family.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.915
You have to obey certain rules.

07:37.999 --> 07:41.377
But I want to run wild and free,
like a real dog!

07:43.088 --> 07:45.923
Son, the world out there is full of traps.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.343
Here, you, you have
a family that loves you.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.972
As long as I do what you say.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.269
Pop, I just don't feel like I belong here.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.021
Didn't you ever feel this way?

08:01.523 --> 08:04.275
I was just like you when I was your age.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.861
You were never like me.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.284
You've been a house dog all your life.
How would you know?

08:13.577 --> 08:15.494
Oh, you'd be surprised.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.455
Scamp, I'm only trying to protect you.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.749
By putting me on a chain?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.710
Those are the rules, Son.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.754
All I ever hear is, "Rules, rules, rules!"

08:26.173 --> 08:28.465
"Don't do this!" and "Don't do that!"

08:28.550 --> 08:32.720
What good are teeth and claws
if you can never use them?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.765
-Stop that howling!
-I can't help it, Pop!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.475
Wild dogs howl at the moon!

08:38.602 --> 08:41.270
There will be no wild dogs in this family!

08:41.438 --> 08:44.106
Then maybe I don't want
to be in this family.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.984
Like it or not, you are
a part of this family!

08:47.110 --> 08:48.819
And until you start acting like it,

08:48.945 --> 08:52.156
you can just get used to
being out here every night!

09:29.653 --> 09:30.653
Hey, Angel!

09:32.864 --> 09:34.365
Why don't you come on out, 'kay?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.159
I can't.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.995
The pup is in chains!

09:40.664 --> 09:42.706
Come back, you mangy mutt!

09:46.836 --> 09:50.089
Hold still so I can take you in
all peaceable-like!

09:50.632 --> 09:52.466
Hey! Where'd you go?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.385
What the...

09:57.722 --> 09:59.098
Hey, drop that!

10:01.476 --> 10:05.020
Defacing a county officer's...
Oh, come on now, that's not fair.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.370
Come on now, hand it over, girl.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.582
Hey!

10:26.876 --> 10:28.127
Hey, drop that!

10:32.465 --> 10:33.757
Hey, gotcha!

10:33.925 --> 10:36.760
It's off to the pound with you,
big fella! Huh?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.596
You don't have to...

10:52.569 --> 10:56.238
Boy, when I get out of here,
I'm gonna do somethin' fierce.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.159
I'm gonna get you...

11:03.955 --> 11:07.082
You little mutt!
You're gonna see what mad is!

11:10.754 --> 11:12.838
I'll get you yet, you hooligans!

11:16.634 --> 11:18.927
Oh, you! Come on!

11:37.280 --> 11:40.866
Far from here is where I want to be

11:41.284 --> 11:44.036
Somewhere out there,
loose and running

11:44.788 --> 11:46.663
Nobody's leash to hold me

11:46.790 --> 11:48.665
Nobody's hugs to crush me

11:48.792 --> 11:50.876
Nobody's soap and scratchy comb

11:50.960 --> 11:54.797
To bathe and brush me

11:55.465 --> 11:59.134
A world without fences

11:59.386 --> 12:02.888
Where I can run free

12:03.515 --> 12:05.808
And be with real dogs

12:05.892 --> 12:09.645
Who'll bring the real dog out in me

12:11.272 --> 12:15.109
No walls and no boundaries

12:15.276 --> 12:18.946
Where I can be free

12:19.364 --> 12:22.825
A world without walls and fences

12:22.909 --> 12:28.122
That's exactly where I want to be

12:35.547 --> 12:39.133
This pup just won't sleep his life away

12:39.217 --> 12:42.761
On some sofa, like his father

12:42.846 --> 12:44.304
Too many bones to chew up

12:44.889 --> 12:46.849
Too many smells to sample

12:46.933 --> 12:50.644
Too many fancy flower beds
To rip and trample

12:57.485 --> 13:00.446
No rules to control me

13:01.489 --> 13:04.450
Stop what I want to be

13:05.410 --> 13:07.870
A world without fences

13:08.329 --> 13:12.833
That's the world I want for me

13:13.460 --> 13:16.879
No rules, no responsibility

13:17.505 --> 13:21.508
On my own, completely free

13:21.718 --> 13:25.137
A world without fences

13:26.723 --> 13:30.309
For me

13:32.687 --> 13:34.688
So long, you house dogs!

13:34.856 --> 13:38.609
You can't tell me what to do any more,
'cause I'm a wild dog!

13:41.029 --> 13:43.614
Hey, you guys, wait for me!

14:55.103 --> 14:57.145
Pretty good pickin's, huh?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.940
I can see you know
your way around an alley.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.192
It's that obvious?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.444
Couldn't miss it if I tried.

15:07.115 --> 15:10.659
This must be your diploma
from the school of hard knocks.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.704
Yeah, I just graduated.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.335
Then you must know this move.
Any street dog would.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.926
Wow! Slick move!

15:28.011 --> 15:30.929
-I mean, that's kid stuff.
-Yeah, right.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.902
You've got your own style,
don't you, tenderfoot?

15:47.905 --> 15:52.200
Listen, you don't belong on the street.
You won't last five minutes out here.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.263
Get going, you crazy mutt!

16:15.224 --> 16:17.559
Hey, you, get out of the street!

16:25.652 --> 16:26.985
Scamp...

16:27.904 --> 16:30.322
Scamp? Oh, no!

16:31.491 --> 16:32.658
Tramp!

16:52.136 --> 16:54.096
They're jumping on the sofa

16:54.514 --> 16:56.973
and playing in the trash.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.310
And breaking stuff!

17:02.772 --> 17:06.316
If only there were hats to chew on.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.740
Goodbye, chains! Hello, freedom!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.242
Go, Buster!

17:16.703 --> 17:18.203
That a way, Buster!

17:18.287 --> 17:20.454
Bust his butt off, Buster!

17:26.713 --> 17:29.297
So, any of you other lowlife mongrels

17:29.382 --> 17:31.842
think you're dog enough
to take Buster on?

17:32.135 --> 17:33.969
Don't be afraid!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.721
Have no fear! Have no fear!

17:39.809 --> 17:41.017
That's right, boys.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.353
Junkyard dogs rule this town.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.898
And Buster rules the junkyard dogs!

17:49.694 --> 17:51.820
Angel! Angel! Talk to me.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.155
Who's the king of the junkyard?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.575
Oh, you are, Buster.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.035
And it's quite a kingdom
you've got here.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.830
That's my girl!

18:01.914 --> 18:03.957
I'm not your girl!

18:04.459 --> 18:06.460
I don't belong to anyone.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.689
Hey, hey. Look here, you guys.
I'd say we got a new recruit.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.192
The little house dog!

18:30.276 --> 18:32.652
Hey, you got off the leash!

18:32.737 --> 18:33.820
Yeah.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.073
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Watch it!

18:37.158 --> 18:38.992
Oh, be still, my heart.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.995
I'm gettin' a bad case of puppy love.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.164
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.417
Hey, Ruby.
I'm the top dog around here.

18:47.502 --> 18:50.921
And nobody joins the junkyard dogs
unless I say so.

18:51.214 --> 18:54.382
So, what's your name, sport?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.926
Name's Scamp.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.429
Well, howdy, Scamperoo.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.642
So, you saw us having some fun
and thought you'd join right in, huh?

19:03.726 --> 19:04.768
Yeah, sure.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.062
Hey, I hate to break
the news to you, champ,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.940
but not many house dogs
get to run in this pack.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.400
-I'm not a house dog.
-Oh, you're not?

19:12.485 --> 19:16.571
Then what's this badge of respectability
hanging around your neck?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.031
Hey, collar boy!

19:18.115 --> 19:19.866
How's life on the end of that chain?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.160
No way!

19:22.245 --> 19:24.454
I've had it with the house dog life.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.165
Nothing there but rules, rules, rules.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.877
I want to be wild and free,
like you guys!

19:31.504 --> 19:33.171
I don't know, kid.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.216
Your average house dog
ain't got what it takes.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.010
Hey, tell him what it takes, Buster!
Tell him what it takes!

19:42.473 --> 19:45.392
In junkyard society

19:45.726 --> 19:48.854
We're repelled by all propriety

19:49.105 --> 19:52.107
Humility and modesty

19:52.191 --> 19:55.485
Good manners and sobriety

19:57.405 --> 19:59.614
We always gulp our meat

19:59.991 --> 20:01.992
Our coats are never neat

20:02.076 --> 20:04.160
Alas, we lack all poise

20:04.370 --> 20:06.454
We're full of natural noise

20:07.206 --> 20:12.335
No pets you stroke and pat
You might as well be a cat

20:12.712 --> 20:18.925
In junkyard society

20:19.552 --> 20:23.513
Society

20:38.863 --> 20:42.032
We are the mutual un-elite

20:42.491 --> 20:45.285
An underclass from our head to feet

20:45.953 --> 20:49.539
Our deeds are spiteful,
our mischief pure

20:49.624 --> 20:52.000
We got a natural disorder

20:52.084 --> 20:55.420
For which there's no cure

20:55.963 --> 20:59.049
Down to the junkyard

20:59.133 --> 21:02.928
Straight to the junkyard

21:03.012 --> 21:06.389
Step to the junkyard

21:06.474 --> 21:08.767
Society rag

21:14.315 --> 21:17.400
That's where you're
nobody's perfumed pet

21:17.818 --> 21:20.153
Where you can wet
where you want to wet

21:21.322 --> 21:24.491
Where you put charity on the shelf

21:24.825 --> 21:27.619
The only one that you'll look out for

21:27.828 --> 21:30.121
Is you yourself

21:31.582 --> 21:34.376
Down in the junkyard

21:34.669 --> 21:38.338
Check out the junkyard

21:38.422 --> 21:41.591
Doin' the junkyard

21:41.676 --> 21:44.844
Society rag

21:46.722 --> 21:49.683
No distemper shots from the vet

21:50.226 --> 21:51.601
Show your temper

21:51.686 --> 21:53.520
Mean as you can get

21:53.771 --> 21:57.565
Down at the yard where we live and let

21:59.485 --> 22:02.362
Chaos and trouble
Oh, we do it double

22:05.616 --> 22:10.203
None of this play-it-safe
house dog stuff

22:10.287 --> 22:13.707
Our days are risky, our nights are "ruff"

22:13.874 --> 22:17.085
The peaceful life leaves us ill at ease

22:17.378 --> 22:21.172
We're crude and loud in a crowd
And very proud of our fleas

22:21.382 --> 22:23.216
Oh, I love this guy!

22:23.300 --> 22:30.056
Down at the junkyard

22:30.349 --> 22:34.310
Check out the junkyard

22:34.395 --> 22:37.814
Step to the junkyard

22:37.898 --> 22:41.526
Straight to the junkyard

22:41.610 --> 22:45.530
Doin' the junkyard

22:48.659 --> 22:49.784
Sing it, boy!

22:49.994 --> 22:52.912
Society rag

22:59.795 --> 23:03.214
What a blast!
I'd never get away with this at home.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.508
So, you really think
you got what it takes

23:05.593 --> 23:07.886
to be a junkyard dog, huh?

23:07.970 --> 23:10.180
Oh, he's got what it takes, Buster.

23:10.264 --> 23:12.348
I saw all his moves back in that alley.

23:13.434 --> 23:15.810
Yeah! Yeah! Watch this slick move!

23:22.151 --> 23:25.236
Talented as you are,
it ain't that easy, sport.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.995
Every day out here
is like a test of survival.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.580
A test!

23:35.664 --> 23:37.040
Beautiful!

23:37.124 --> 23:38.208
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Good!

23:38.501 --> 23:42.003
Baby, I always get my best ideas
when you're around.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.255
That's why you're my girl.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.341
I'm not your girl.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.469
Okay, Scampers, we'll give you a shot.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.013
But you gotta pass
a little test of courage

23:53.599 --> 23:55.266
in Reggie's alley.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.352
-What?
-But it's never been done before!

23:57.603 --> 24:00.480
Come here. Don't listen to them.
I got faith in you, kid.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.898
It's just a little test

24:01.982 --> 24:04.609
to prove you can stand
on your own four paws.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.071
Easy. I'm not afraid of anything.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.366
That's what I like about you, kid.
You got spunk.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.914
-Did you call the pound?
-Yes, dear.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.874
They haven't seen him.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.545
Oh, Tramp.
Scamp's never been out all night.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.463
So much could happen.

24:25.548 --> 24:26.965
Hey, easy, Pidge.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.844
We'll find him before he gets himself
in real trouble.

24:30.928 --> 24:34.389
Oh, Miss Lady, ma'am!

24:34.723 --> 24:36.891
We came as soon as we heard.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.314
Uncle Jock! Uncle Trusty!
Scamp ran away!

24:43.399 --> 24:44.440
What they said!

24:44.525 --> 24:46.693
Not to worry, little ladies.

24:47.111 --> 24:51.990
Got my grandpappy Ol' Reliable's
keen sense of smell.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.744
Say, have I ever told
you girls about the time

24:56.829 --> 24:59.914
I saved your father from certain death?

25:00.416 --> 25:01.457
-No!
-No!

25:01.542 --> 25:02.584
Yup!

25:03.127 --> 25:07.213
Here he goes again.
I told you, there'll be no livin' with him.

25:08.716 --> 25:12.135
That Scamp is gonna get
into so much trouble

25:12.219 --> 25:14.470
when he gets home! Yeah!

25:15.723 --> 25:18.349
-I don't even want him back.
-Yeah, who cares?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.018
He should know better than to run off.

25:20.102 --> 25:26.024
I bet he gets a slipper
right across his great, big, fat...

25:28.611 --> 25:30.695
We really do miss him, Mom.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.865
We'll be back with
your brother in no time.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.618
Your old man's got twice
the speed and cunning

25:36.702 --> 25:38.661
as any dog half his age.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.960
Just usin' a few forgotten
muscles, that's all.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.338
Lady! Tramp! Let's go!

25:50.007 --> 25:53.676
Come on. No tellin' what mischief
that pup's gettin' into.

25:54.845 --> 25:58.264
All right, Scampster. Fetch the can

25:58.349 --> 25:59.974
outta the alley.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.187
See ya!

27:18.387 --> 27:20.138
It's a spook! A spook!

27:20.597 --> 27:22.390
It's Reggie! Scatter!

27:46.498 --> 27:47.874
Where, oh, where

27:47.958 --> 27:49.917
Has my little dog...

27:50.461 --> 27:52.086
Well, I'll be.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.464
You're not gettin' away this time!

27:59.678 --> 28:01.179
I gotcha now, you little hoodlum!

28:05.642 --> 28:07.810
Hey! Hey, now, get off of there!

28:07.895 --> 28:10.021
What are you, mad?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.147
You crazy...

28:27.498 --> 28:30.708
That'll get you
hard time in the pound, fella.

28:31.335 --> 28:34.629
Attackin' a deputy animal
control officer's vehicle.

28:37.091 --> 28:40.093
And a fine modern machine
like this one at that.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.470
Two horsepower,
three miles to the gallon.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.846
Boy, I tell you...

28:44.056 --> 28:45.139
Hey.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.892
You saved my life.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.312
Nobody else here would
have dared to do that.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.314
Wow, did you see that?

28:53.399 --> 28:56.734
-Is it possible?
-Scamp is a canine hurricane!

28:56.902 --> 28:59.362
You did everyone a big favour, 'kay?

28:59.446 --> 29:02.323
Oui, you are practically the hero!

29:05.828 --> 29:07.328
Shouldn't we go after him
or something?

29:07.413 --> 29:09.831
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You got it all wrong, kid.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.542
In the junkyard,
it's every dog for himself.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.336
I can see we're gonna have
to put you to another test.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.673
Anything you say, Buster.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.930
-Will somebody open this thing?
-Okay! Okay! Okay!

29:30.727 --> 29:33.688
-Is that open enough?
-Magnifique, Mooch!

29:33.772 --> 29:34.939
That's using your head!

29:35.441 --> 29:37.108
Thanks again, huh?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.947
You comin', tenderfoot?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.956
I hit the thingy.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.058
This is great! This is living.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.519
I never get to do this at home.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.147
After I pass my next test,

30:16.231 --> 30:19.442
I'm gonna be the best
junkyard dog there ever was!

30:19.860 --> 30:21.569
I don't think so, doll.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.156
You may be good, but you'll
never be as good as the master.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.200
Here we go.

30:27.284 --> 30:28.451
Ruby's right, carnsarnit!

30:28.535 --> 30:30.369
In my day, there was only one stray

30:30.454 --> 30:32.872
by which all dogs was measured.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.624
The Tramp!

30:34.708 --> 30:36.417
Huh? What?

30:36.543 --> 30:38.794
He taught Buster
everything there is to know

30:38.879 --> 30:40.630
about being on the streets, 'kay?

30:40.714 --> 30:42.798
Buster's trouble was Tramp's trouble.

30:42.883 --> 30:46.427
And Tramp's trouble
was Buster's trouble, 'kay?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.429
That dog was a prize.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.306
The one that got away.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.391
Got away from me, at least.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.519
Got away with everything!

30:54.645 --> 30:58.022
I heard he once stole
an entire meat wagon!

30:58.106 --> 31:00.525
'Kay? Yeah, and then the dogcatcher

31:00.609 --> 31:03.152
chased him all the way to the river.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.532
No, sir. It was dogcatchers.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.617
How many?

31:10.118 --> 31:11.869
At least a dozen.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.749
Two dozen. Now that I think about it,

31:16.833 --> 31:20.002
the police and the army cavalry
were after the boy as well.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.214
He was trapped!

31:24.007 --> 31:29.929
But if the Tramp was gonna go,
he was gonna go in style.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.561
So, what happened?

31:37.771 --> 31:39.730
We never saw him again after that.

31:40.440 --> 31:45.027
They say when the wind blows,
you can still hear the Tramp...

31:47.573 --> 31:48.864
Wow.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.325
All right, all right.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.452
That is not what happened.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.622
He met this girl, see?

31:56.999 --> 31:59.083
Queen of a kennel club set.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.127
Even her prissy little name

32:01.211 --> 32:04.213
still leaves a bad taste in my mouth!

32:05.048 --> 32:06.132
Lady.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.468
But he met his true love.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.429
He betrayed me!

32:11.847 --> 32:14.640
You can't have a family
and still be a junkyard dog!

32:14.808 --> 32:18.728
So I gave Tramp a choice.
It's either me or her.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.647
And he picked life on the end of a chain.

32:22.316 --> 32:24.525
Hooked up with a real powder puff!

32:24.610 --> 32:27.945
Sleepin' on carpets!
Free room and board!

32:28.155 --> 32:30.865
Livin' the cushy pillow life!

32:33.660 --> 32:37.580
That's when I learned the first rule
about being a junkyard dog...

32:37.706 --> 32:40.333
Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble.

32:41.335 --> 32:45.212
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
The Tramp used to scratch like that.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.424
You ain't related, are ya?

32:48.925 --> 32:51.093
-Who, me? No way!
-Good.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.180
'Cause if you were, you'd be kibble.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.685
Right, Buster.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.693
No way, Dad.

33:08.195 --> 33:09.904
That can't be true.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.864
You gave it all up?

33:12.115 --> 33:14.241
I mean, what could be better than this?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.910
You okay, tenderfoot?

33:16.078 --> 33:18.704
Who, me? Yeah. Yeah, sure.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.207
What are you doing out here?

33:21.291 --> 33:23.918
Don't you have
a nice family back home?

33:24.336 --> 33:27.463
What difference does it make?
All families are alike.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.050
They make you take baths
and sleep in a bed,

33:31.343 --> 33:33.511
and you have to eat
everything in your bowl,

33:33.595 --> 33:36.514
and when it rains,
you have to come indoors.

33:36.973 --> 33:40.059
Let's just say you're lucky
you've never had to live with a family.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.144
Wrong again, tenderfoot.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.979
You mean, you had a family?

33:44.064 --> 33:46.732
Actually, I've had five families.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.656
-I always thought one was too many.
-I could never get one to stick.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.742
Someone would take me in,
and just when I'd start to think,

33:56.910 --> 33:59.370
"Wow, this is my family,"

34:00.664 --> 34:05.167
they'd move or have a new baby
or have an allergy.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.504
Same old story... I'm out on the street.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.675
Wait a minute.
You really want a family, don't you?

34:13.092 --> 34:14.510
But you've got Buster.

34:14.594 --> 34:18.222
Buster! You can't tell him. You can't!
He'll kick me out.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.516
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

34:21.851 --> 34:22.893
I promise.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.396
Thanks.

34:28.358 --> 34:31.110
So, I guess you're Buster's girl, huh?

34:31.737 --> 34:35.322
I am not Buster's girl!
I don't belong to anybody.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.117
The junkyard dogs
aren't much of a family,

34:38.201 --> 34:39.952
but what choice do I have?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.871
What more do you need?

34:41.955 --> 34:44.373
As a junkyard dog, you can stay up late

34:44.458 --> 34:45.875
-or dig or...
-Run.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.793
-Yeah. Or play or dig or...
-Run!

34:48.879 --> 34:52.005
-Right. Or chase squirrels...
-No! I mean, run!

35:06.146 --> 35:07.271
Come on!

35:11.943 --> 35:12.985
Angel!

35:14.613 --> 35:15.654
Angel! Angel, help!

35:16.615 --> 35:18.199
Now would be a good time! Hurry!

35:39.137 --> 35:41.138
Scamp? Scamp!

35:44.643 --> 35:47.019
Scamp, where are you?

35:47.395 --> 35:49.146
Scamp? Scamp?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.275
Excuse me, I'm looking for...

35:56.738 --> 36:00.032
I think I'm onto somethin'.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.992
Aye? Are you sure?

36:04.162 --> 36:07.164
I most assuredly got him!

36:07.499 --> 36:09.583
-This way!
-Come on, Pidge!

36:16.716 --> 36:18.259
-Oh, look!
-Scamp!

36:20.095 --> 36:21.136
Oh, please.

36:28.937 --> 36:29.979
Scamp!

36:34.317 --> 36:35.734
Thank goodness.

36:36.862 --> 36:40.197
A wig? You smelled a wig, man!

36:40.699 --> 36:42.032
You're hopeless!

36:43.743 --> 36:45.786
I'm sorry, Miss Lady.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.790
Come on. We've gotta keep searching.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.296
I shouldn't have been so hard on him.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.646
-Hey.
-Scamp?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.357
You're all right. I was so worried...

37:15.442 --> 37:16.942
So worried?

37:17.944 --> 37:20.988
Yeah, right.
Get over yourself, house pet.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.368
There's gotta be a better way
to take a bath, huh?

37:26.870 --> 37:29.538
Trust me, there is
no good way to take a bath.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.047
Wow! That is so weird.
How'd you do that?

37:38.882 --> 37:40.633
-Talent.
-Let me try.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.890
Oh, that was smooth.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.059
You really are a house dog.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.436
Oh, yeah? Yeah!

37:54.356 --> 37:57.608
-You're weird.
-No, you're the weird one.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.235
-Oh, yeah?
-Scamp.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.956
I never had this feeling before

38:12.457 --> 38:16.293
She gives me shakes
and shivers I can't ignore

38:16.378 --> 38:20.297
And I see that there's more now

38:20.840 --> 38:24.176
Than just running free

38:24.719 --> 38:28.305
I never felt my heart beat so fast

38:28.723 --> 38:32.601
I'm thinking of him first
and of myself last

38:32.686 --> 38:37.982
And how happy I want him to be

38:40.110 --> 38:44.279
It's amazing someone in my life

38:44.656 --> 38:47.658
Just might be loving me

38:49.661 --> 38:54.665
I didn't know that I could feel this way

38:56.126 --> 39:00.504
It's so crazy something in my life

39:00.880 --> 39:05.217
Is better than a dream

39:05.969 --> 39:11.140
I didn't know that I could feel this way

39:17.480 --> 39:20.733
She makes me warm and happy inside

39:21.693 --> 39:25.779
He smiles and I
get dizzy and starry-eyed

39:25.905 --> 39:29.033
-All these feelings I have
-All these feelings I have

39:29.367 --> 39:31.702
-Have me asking
-Have me asking

39:32.037 --> 39:36.790
Can this be love?

39:37.042 --> 39:38.625
It's crazy

39:38.710 --> 39:41.295
-I can hardly speak
-I can hardly speak

39:41.546 --> 39:43.422
-Whenever he
-Whenever she

39:43.506 --> 39:45.883
-Says hi
-Says hi

39:46.551 --> 39:49.803
I didn't know that I could feel

39:50.680 --> 39:54.308
I never dreamed that I could feel

39:54.392 --> 39:57.853
-I didn't know that I could feel
-I didn't know that I could feel

39:58.313 --> 40:01.315
-This
-This

40:03.485 --> 40:04.568
-Way
-Way

40:37.268 --> 40:40.312
Nice neighbourhood. Snob Hill.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.773
Hey, Jim Dear never
leaves this gate open.

40:43.691 --> 40:44.733
Come on, Tramp.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.361
Oh, no! We gotta get out of here!

40:47.445 --> 40:49.113
Why? What's wrong?

40:53.076 --> 40:56.203
Come on, boy.
We've done all we can for one day.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.588
Oh, we'll find him.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.591
You were the best street dog
there ever was,

41:10.051 --> 41:12.761
and I still have faith in the old Tramp.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.263
Old Tramp?

41:15.557 --> 41:18.142
If only the old Tramp was still here.

41:20.061 --> 41:23.564
Come on, Tramp!
We'll find Scamp tomorrow.

41:26.442 --> 41:29.611
-The Tramp is your father?
-I... Wait, no, wait!

41:30.738 --> 41:32.114
Angel, wait!

41:41.166 --> 41:42.499
Did you find him?

41:43.585 --> 41:44.585
Maybe tomorrow.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.673
Scamp.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.009
Bad Scamp.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.323
Gosh, I didn't think
they'd miss me that much.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.575
You didn't think they'd miss you?

42:16.659 --> 42:20.037
I can't believe you'd run away
from a home like this.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.540
Well, you don't know what it was like.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.042
No, I don't.

42:25.293 --> 42:26.585
Must have been horrible

42:26.669 --> 42:29.379
having someone care
about you that much.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.049
I need to be wild and free.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.301
I'll never find that here.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.845
I'd give anything to have what you have.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.306
And I'd give anything
to have what you have.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.313
Come on, Scamp.
We could run off together.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.148
We don't need them.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.692
Angel, don't you understand?

42:50.818 --> 42:54.404
Only one more test,
and I'll finally be a junkyard dog.

42:54.656 --> 42:58.200
-That's where I belong.
-No, you don't belong there.

42:58.493 --> 43:02.412
You're better than that, Scamp,
and that's what I like about you.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.879
Come on, tenderfoot, let's go.

43:36.781 --> 43:37.864
Wow!

43:42.704 --> 43:44.204
Wow! Look!

43:57.468 --> 43:59.720
I really think we should keep searching.

43:59.929 --> 44:01.179
Nonsense!

44:01.264 --> 44:03.724
It's the Fourth of July!
Time to have some fun.

44:03.808 --> 44:06.560
You can continue
your search after our picnic.

44:06.644 --> 44:10.105
Aunt Sarah, we're not really
in the mood to celebrate.

44:10.732 --> 44:13.817
Oh, come now, Scamp will be all right.
You'll find him.

44:14.110 --> 44:15.986
But, first, let's eat.

44:18.865 --> 44:21.700
I won't have my Fourth of July
ruined by that little Scamp.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.869
There, there, boy.

44:35.006 --> 44:38.467
I knew it. Beautiful.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.762
Scampo, front and centre.
Take a look out there.

44:41.971 --> 44:43.347
See that family?

44:44.015 --> 44:46.600
You mean that family, over there?

44:46.893 --> 44:49.269
No! This family, right here.

44:49.771 --> 44:51.438
Now, as your final test,

44:51.522 --> 44:55.525
I want you to infiltrate their picnic
and liberate their chicken

44:55.735 --> 44:59.488
right out from under the nose
of that meek little house dog.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.325
You don't have to prove
anything, Scamp.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.701
Just walk away.

45:04.911 --> 45:06.620
Since when do you care so much?

45:06.704 --> 45:08.705
I thought you were better than this.

45:08.790 --> 45:10.665
Pipe down, Angelcakes!

45:11.542 --> 45:12.918
Come on, kid.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.463
You wanna be wild and free, don't you?

45:17.048 --> 45:20.008
All it's gonna cost you
is one juicy chicken.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.470
Yeah. I shoulda known.

45:23.596 --> 45:26.056
Once a house dog, always a house dog.

45:26.349 --> 45:27.682
I'm no house dog!

45:39.987 --> 45:40.987
Scamp back!

45:42.657 --> 45:43.740
Oh, my goodness!

45:44.951 --> 45:47.035
-Scamp!
-Monster!

45:47.829 --> 45:49.246
Scamp back! Scamp back!

45:50.081 --> 45:52.082
-Scamp wanna play!
-Scamp?

45:53.334 --> 45:54.709
-Come back!
-Where him go?

45:54.794 --> 45:56.586
It's chow time, boys!

46:29.787 --> 46:30.954
You...

46:31.581 --> 46:34.249
You little mutt! I won't forget you!

46:34.625 --> 46:37.252
I'll lock you in the pound, I swear it!

46:48.556 --> 46:50.682
Slick move. Lost him.

46:50.766 --> 46:51.975
-Don't bet on it!
-What?

46:55.229 --> 46:56.980
Hey, slow down there, whirlwind.

46:57.190 --> 46:59.191
I'm not going home! You can't make me.

46:59.275 --> 47:01.651
I know, I know. Easy.

47:01.819 --> 47:05.071
I just want to talk.
So, how you doin' out here?

47:05.239 --> 47:06.656
It's great, Dad.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.909
The junkyard dogs have
taught me all the tricks.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.912
I go wherever I want,
do whatever I please.

47:11.996 --> 47:15.749
-No chains, no fences.
-No regard for someone else's lunch?

47:16.125 --> 47:18.585
That's how it is out here on the streets.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.671
But then, you know
all about that, don't you?

47:22.173 --> 47:23.465
You make the rules, Dad,

47:23.549 --> 47:25.675
but you didn't have to follow them
when you were my age.

47:26.177 --> 47:28.970
Is that why you didn't tell me
you were a street dog?

47:29.055 --> 47:31.389
I didn't want that life for you,

47:31.474 --> 47:33.725
because I found something better.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.143
I found love.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.271
Ain't that beautiful?

47:38.564 --> 47:40.440
I think I'm gettin' all misty-eyed here.

47:40.650 --> 47:42.442
I see you haven't changed a bit.

47:42.527 --> 47:46.488
So here we are again,
just like old times,

47:47.240 --> 47:49.908
before you turned
your back on everything

47:49.992 --> 47:51.868
that makes a dog a dog.

47:52.328 --> 47:53.620
He says you walked out on him.

47:53.829 --> 47:57.082
After I met your mother,
I guess Buster just got jealous.

47:57.166 --> 47:59.751
-You ditched me!
-I fell in love!

47:59.835 --> 48:02.712
You made your choice!
Now it's his turn to choose.

48:02.922 --> 48:04.214
Come on, kid.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.508
You don't know what
he's really like, Son.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.635
-You're coming home.
-You hear that, kid?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.303
Daddy's tellin' you what to do again.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.846
You don't belong here.

48:11.931 --> 48:14.766
And he's leading you
back to a life on the chain.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.101
I'm offerin' you freedom.

48:16.269 --> 48:17.352
-Scamp.
-Scamp!

48:17.436 --> 48:18.478
-Scamp!
-Scamp!

48:18.563 --> 48:20.897
-Make your choice, kid.
-He doesn't have a choice.

48:21.315 --> 48:23.400
I know what's best for him!

48:24.443 --> 48:26.444
No! You know what's best for you!

48:27.697 --> 48:29.573
Well, I'm not you, Dad!

48:30.408 --> 48:32.117
I'm a junkyard dog!

48:33.703 --> 48:34.744
That's my boy.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.752
I guess there are some things
you have to learn on your own.

48:43.045 --> 48:46.172
When you've had enough,
our door is always open.

48:48.217 --> 48:50.010
House dog to the end.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.761
What'd I tell ya, kid?

48:51.846 --> 48:54.097
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

48:57.893 --> 48:58.935
-Huh?
-Huh?

49:06.027 --> 49:08.903
Hey, Scampski!
This is for all you've done, kid.

49:17.955 --> 49:20.373
You did it, kid!
You're at the top of the heap now...

49:20.458 --> 49:21.958
A junkyard dog!

49:22.293 --> 49:24.544
I'm... I'm a junkyard dog.

49:24.879 --> 49:26.630
You made it to the pack!

49:27.048 --> 49:28.965
You're a doll, dollface.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.890
I'm a junkyard dog!

49:50.946 --> 49:53.406
-How could you do that?
-Come on, Angel!

49:53.491 --> 49:55.700
He's your father! Go after him!

49:55.785 --> 49:57.577
You're not like the rest of us.

49:57.662 --> 50:00.246
You're good and decent. Kind.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.916
The streets will beat that
out of you if you stay!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.042
But I made it!

50:04.126 --> 50:06.419
This is everything that
I've ever dreamed of.

50:06.921 --> 50:09.422
Dreamed of what? This?

50:11.926 --> 50:15.011
You have a home
and a family that loves you.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.180
You're not like the rest of us, Scamp.

50:17.431 --> 50:18.765
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

50:18.849 --> 50:23.770
Let's see,
he's good and decent and kind.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.980
Is that it, Scampy?

50:27.525 --> 50:29.567
You wanna be a widdle house doggie?

50:29.652 --> 50:30.694
No!

50:30.778 --> 50:33.822
'Cause you know how I feel
about house dogs.

50:34.115 --> 50:35.281
Hey, cut it out!

50:35.366 --> 50:38.034
She's the one who wants to be
a house dog, not me!

50:39.370 --> 50:40.620
Oh, no. I didn't mean that.

50:40.705 --> 50:42.038
Is that true, Angel baby?

50:43.708 --> 50:45.625
I don't think a family's so bad.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.127
You hear that, boys?

50:47.211 --> 50:49.713
She wants to be a little house pet!

50:50.131 --> 50:51.798
Oh, she want to be a little house pet!

50:51.966 --> 50:53.174
Gonna wear ribbons.

50:53.384 --> 50:55.468
You ain't no junkyard dog.

50:55.720 --> 50:59.180
That's right, Buster.
I'm not. Not any more.

51:00.141 --> 51:03.059
Oh, and... I'm not your girl.

51:04.812 --> 51:06.646
There's going to be trouble!

51:07.314 --> 51:10.400
-Maybe you do belong here.
-Oh, come on.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.402
Where is your sense of humour?

51:12.486 --> 51:14.028
Come on, Angel!

51:15.197 --> 51:16.698
Who needs her?

51:16.866 --> 51:18.158
Let her go find some
snivelling little family.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.202
That's where she belongs.

51:21.746 --> 51:33.506
Angel?

51:36.886 --> 51:40.221
I didn't mean it, Angel!
I don't know what I was thinking!

51:41.223 --> 51:42.474
Really!

51:46.520 --> 51:48.354
Angel, where are you?

51:49.482 --> 51:52.901
Just as I suspected,
out looking for Angel.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.198
Beautiful.

51:58.407 --> 52:00.533
Time to settle an old score.

52:03.078 --> 52:05.371
Hold it right there, ya scoundrel!

52:16.300 --> 52:17.801
What the...

52:19.011 --> 52:20.595
Well, I'll be!

52:20.763 --> 52:22.889
You're not gettin' away this time!

52:26.268 --> 52:29.312
Great. I got everything I ever wanted,

52:30.397 --> 52:31.898
and it stinks.

52:33.692 --> 52:35.485
Come here, ya little hooligan!

52:47.122 --> 52:48.164
Buster!

52:58.676 --> 52:59.926
Gotcha!

53:00.594 --> 53:03.596
Well, lookee here. No collar.

53:04.265 --> 53:07.100
It's a one-way trip to the pound for you.

53:16.110 --> 53:19.445
Oh, man, slick move.
Me without a collar.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.531
How could I be so stupid?

53:22.658 --> 53:24.158
Dad was right.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.536
Buster's nothing but trouble.

53:27.329 --> 53:28.997
I wish I was home.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.633
Always there

53:41.218 --> 53:44.304
To warm you in the winter

53:45.306 --> 53:47.891
Always there

53:48.142 --> 53:51.311
With shelter from the rain

53:51.979 --> 53:54.314
Always there

53:54.565 --> 53:57.483
To catch you when you're falling

53:57.985 --> 54:02.906
Always there to stand you up again

54:04.241 --> 54:07.160
Family

54:10.164 --> 54:12.832
By your side

54:12.917 --> 54:15.877
In seconds if you ask it

54:16.503 --> 54:18.963
Arms out wide

54:19.048 --> 54:22.175
To welcome you to stay

54:22.718 --> 54:25.094
Near enough

54:25.679 --> 54:28.598
To listen to your heart song

54:28.849 --> 54:30.516
Always there

54:30.601 --> 54:33.186
To help you on your way

54:34.939 --> 54:38.191
Family

54:39.902 --> 54:41.778
-Family
-Family

54:41.862 --> 54:46.199
What is a family?

54:48.702 --> 54:52.455
Caring and devoted hearts

54:54.208 --> 54:58.544
With endless love to share

54:59.964 --> 55:05.426
-Love that will follow you everywhere
-Love that will follow you everywhere

55:06.136 --> 55:08.680
Always there

55:08.764 --> 55:11.140
To welcome you in winter

55:11.225 --> 55:13.017
What is a family?

55:13.102 --> 55:14.811
Arms out wide

55:14.895 --> 55:17.063
To welcome you to stay

55:17.147 --> 55:18.231
Right by your side

55:18.315 --> 55:20.441
Near enough

55:21.026 --> 55:24.487
-To listen to your heart song
-To listen to your heart song

55:24.989 --> 55:26.364
Always there

55:26.448 --> 55:29.325
To help you on your way

55:29.493 --> 55:30.535
Family

55:31.078 --> 55:32.537
Always there

55:32.663 --> 55:35.832
Family

55:35.958 --> 55:39.711
-Family
-Family

55:50.389 --> 55:52.682
-Scamp?
-Angel!

55:53.017 --> 55:55.601
-Scamp!
-Get out of here! He'll get you, too!

56:08.490 --> 56:11.034
This'll hold ya, you crazy mutt!

56:11.118 --> 56:13.411
Thought you could outfox me, huh?

56:13.495 --> 56:14.662
Well, that'll be the day.

56:18.792 --> 56:22.045
Hey, kid, looks like you got thrown
in the wrong cell!

56:24.840 --> 56:27.216
Hey, Reggie. Long time no see, huh?

56:35.559 --> 56:36.809
Oh, I found you!

56:37.061 --> 56:39.270
You gotta come! Hurry!
Scamp's in trouble!

56:39.480 --> 56:41.731
-Scamp?
-He's in the pound!

56:59.374 --> 57:00.875
-Hold on, Son!
-Dad!

57:04.588 --> 57:06.631
Keep your paws off my boy!

57:16.266 --> 57:18.142
Hey! Paws off my pop!

57:41.875 --> 57:43.709
Oh, yeah! He's cashed in his bones.

57:43.794 --> 57:44.836
He's cashed!

57:58.684 --> 57:59.725
Dad?

58:06.191 --> 58:07.817
Dad, you did it!

58:08.235 --> 58:09.610
Slick move!

58:11.321 --> 58:13.281
All right, we have to go now.

58:15.826 --> 58:18.411
You! The one that got away.

58:22.166 --> 58:25.084
Let go! Let go! Oh, no!
Oh, have mercy!

58:25.294 --> 58:26.919
Oh, let... Oh, let go!

58:31.175 --> 58:34.385
Aren't the fireworks lovely tonight?

58:35.596 --> 58:38.556
Angel!

58:40.225 --> 58:41.601
Come on, you two.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.227
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What about me?

58:43.312 --> 58:45.188
Your old pal, right? Oh, come on!

58:45.272 --> 58:47.106
After I stood by youse
all through that fight?

58:47.191 --> 58:49.317
Hey, come back here
when you're walking away from me!

58:55.199 --> 58:56.532
-Pop?
-Son.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.327
I'm so sorry.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.537
I shouldn't have run away.

59:03.665 --> 59:04.999
Whirlwind.

59:05.626 --> 59:08.794
Maybe I was also being
a little too tough on you.

59:08.962 --> 59:10.463
I don't see any harm in the two of us

59:10.547 --> 59:12.131
goin' down to the river once in a while

59:12.216 --> 59:14.133
to bay at the moon. What do you say?

59:14.218 --> 59:15.551
Really? You and me?

59:16.053 --> 59:18.137
Your old man's still
got a few good howls

59:18.222 --> 59:20.473
-left in him.
-I found him!

59:23.393 --> 59:25.728
I found him for sure this time!

59:25.812 --> 59:27.063
I found him!

59:27.648 --> 59:30.566
You found nothing! Again!

59:30.859 --> 59:34.612
So far you've found six cats,
three gophers, two rabbits...

59:34.696 --> 59:37.573
-Go easy on him, Uncle Jock.
-No, I'll not go easy on him, Scamp!

59:37.658 --> 59:39.700
Five flyin' pigs, a wildebeest!

59:40.077 --> 59:41.160
Scamp?

59:43.247 --> 59:45.539
Why, it is Scamp!

59:46.166 --> 59:49.752
Aye, I'll never hear
the end of this one, either.

59:51.964 --> 59:54.966
-Ready to go home, whirlwind?
-Not quite, Pop.

59:55.175 --> 59:58.094
There's one last thing
I gotta take care of.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.473
Do mine eyes deceive me?

01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:05.309
Hey, Scamp! Scampadoodle!

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.311
You escaped the pound!

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.397
Yeah, no thanks to you!

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.149
Hey, come on. You know our motto.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.610
You can keep your motto!

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.780
But not this.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.492
I'm going home where I belong.

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:25.913
So long, Buster.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:30.793
Hey, ya missed, Scampalooza! Huh?

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.929
-That's my boy!
-Let's go home, Pop.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:45.141
I'll get... Come back here!
You can't leave me here!

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:46.726
You're nothin' but a house pet!

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:51.022
It's a good look for you, Buster.
The garbage adds some class.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.442
Hey. Hey, someone wanna
lend me a paw here?

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.485
I think a home sounds nice.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.363
With lots of children
and hugs and kisses!

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.576
If you dogs leave,
you're never comin' back!

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.369
Au revoir, Buster!

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:08.289
It has been, as you say, beautiful!

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.625
Dogs! You can't leave me here!
I was only kidding.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.961
Buster's trouble ain't Buster's trouble.

01:01:14.046 --> 01:01:17.214
Come on.
Buster's trouble is everybody's trouble!

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.304
What's all the commotion? Scamp?

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.723
Hi, Scamp! Scamp come home!

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:26.891
He's back!

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.936
Hi, Scamp, I love you!

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.190
Good job, boy.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.029
Oh, Scamp.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.407
It's so good to have you
back where you belong.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.620
You reek! You need a bath.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:52.625
But we'll worry about that later.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:02.468
Jim Dear, I think Scamp
brought a friend home.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:05.596
Hey there, girl. Come on.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.265
Come on, girl. It's okay.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.434
Don't be afraid.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:13.771
Did you help our Scamp
out of those lonely streets?

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.654
She's a little angel.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.489
Angel! Angel!

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.741
Jim Dear, you don't suppose...

01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:28.953
Oh, no, Darling.
We've got enough dogs as it is.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.038
You know we can't...

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:34.250
No. No. We can't. I...

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.628
Oh, what's the use?

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.297
Welcome to the family, Angel.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:41.841
Angel!

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.635
In our small, little, not too big

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:48.180
Little, homey, nice, little, quaint, little
Always friendly

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:52.226
Old New England town

01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:02.278
Welcome

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:06.490
