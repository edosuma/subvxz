00:17.500 --> 00:19.678
Ain't working out for y'all, huh?

00:20.300 --> 00:24.400
–Mars is the God of war, right?
–Planet, too.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.862
I know it's a planet.
But the clue is “Greek God of war.”

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Ares.

00:33.100 --> 00:37.192
Greeks called him Ares.
Same dude, different name, that's all.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.200
Ares fits. Thanks.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.800
It's all good.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.560
See, back in middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.600
That stuff was deep. Truly.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.500
You're up.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.576
State calls Omar Little, Your Honor.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.400
Faggot.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.960
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth…

01:21.000 --> 01:23.760
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.000
I surely do.

01:26.100 --> 01:30.300
–State your name for the record.
–Omar Devon Little.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.600
–Mr Little, how old are you?
–About 29, thereabout.

01:34.700 --> 01:38.160
–And where do you live?
–No place in particular, ma'am.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.600
–You're homeless?
–In the wind, so to speak.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.600
–And what is your occupation?
–Occupation?

01:46.300 --> 01:49.402
What exactly do you do for a living,
Mr Little?

01:50.300 --> 01:51.500
I rip and run.

01:52.900 --> 01:55.800
–You….
–I robs drug dealers.

01:59.300 --> 02:03.392
And exactly how long has this been
your occupation, Mr Little?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.400
I don't know exactly.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.033
I venture to say
maybe about eight or nine years.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.560
Mr Little, how does a man rob drug dealers
for eight or nine years…

02:13.600 --> 02:15.500
and live to tell about it?

02:20.700 --> 02:22.600
Day at a time, I suppose.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.200
What do we know?

04:01.300 --> 04:04.960
On Sobotka, very little.
He seems to live within his means.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.498
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck, modest savings.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.660
–Credit history is okay.
–There's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.860
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.

04:14.900 --> 04:18.560
–Or maybe he's hiding it.
–The union is also a little threadbare.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.260
They paid the taxes on union hall
almost a year late…

04:21.300 --> 04:23.860
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.360
Looking at their books—

04:25.400 --> 04:27.860
–You subpoenaed their books?
–You don't need to.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.960
IBS books are open
to the Justice Department…

04:30.000 --> 04:32.260
under the terms
of a federal racketeering case…

04:32.300 --> 04:35.260
–that came out of New York five years ago.
–We called Washington.

04:35.300 --> 04:38.860
They sent us a copy of everything
the Baltimore locals have filed.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.660
The books show
that there's less than a 100 checkers…

04:41.700 --> 04:43.900
still paying dues to 15-14.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.060
And that's down from about 300 in the '70s.
They're hurting.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.660
So where's all this money
Valchek is talking about?

04:50.700 --> 04:54.460
The IBS hired Bruce DiBiago
to lobby Annapolis this session.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.060
And through individual officers
and union members…

04:57.100 --> 04:59.938
they've paid about $70,000
to various PACs…

05:00.000 --> 05:02.460
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.160
They show any of that on their books?

05:04.200 --> 05:07.060
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance reports.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.060
That's just what was in the names
of the union officers we cross-referenced.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.872
–So, where's the cash coming from?
–Drugs?

05:14.200 --> 05:18.400
So far, DNRs
on the union hall phones don't show much.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.060
Union business and personal calls,
but no beepers…

05:22.100 --> 05:25.660
and not much in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.960
What's with those hand-to-hands?
Anything connect?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.260
We're buying from a lot of white boys.

05:30.300 --> 05:34.128
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.

05:34.400 --> 05:39.086
–But any port connections feel random.
–The money comes from somewhere.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.800
Maybe it's what the checkers do.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.500
I mean…

05:45.100 --> 05:48.060
they monitor what comes in
and out of the port.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.852
–That's what they do, that's their value.
–They're bringing the shit in?

05:52.900 --> 05:54.760
Or they're letting it happen.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.354
Like that can full of dead girls.
They kept that out of the computer.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.960
Which is why we're gonna quietly do
some work on that side of things.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.200
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.100
No problem.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.760
If they're coming into Baltimore,
who's working them?

06:12.800 --> 06:16.960
Are they club dancing, whoring?
We need to plug into that circuit.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.460
As for the rest of you…

06:18.500 --> 06:21.460
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail
and with the DNRs…

06:21.500 --> 06:23.660
looking for connections to the union money.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.800
Herc and Carver…

06:24.900 --> 06:27.960
you guys keep working the drug corners
near the port.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.260
Officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland
are assigned to Homicide…

06:31.300 --> 06:33.260
but for the time being they'll be with us…

06:33.300 --> 06:37.560
running the port database, looking
for any pattern involving contraband.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
Questions?

06:50.400 --> 06:51.700
Excuse me.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.300
–I'm Thomas.
–Beadie.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.558
Would you like to go to Royal Farms,
maybe get a cup of coffee?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.000
Right.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.900
Yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?

07:08.400 --> 07:11.860
Listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties
to make some soup with…

07:11.900 --> 07:14.870
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.660
You were at the opposite end
of the parking lot…

07:20.700 --> 07:23.460
–when the assailant drew his gun?
–Thereabout.

07:23.500 --> 07:28.318
Do you see the gunman who killed Mr Gant
anywhere in the courtroom today?

07:28.500 --> 07:30.100
Yo, what up, Bird?

07:30.300 --> 07:34.360
For the record, you are identifying
the defendant, Marquis Hilton.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.900
It's just Bird to me.

07:36.600 --> 07:40.360
And Mr Little, you had seen him
many times before, had you not?

07:40.400 --> 07:45.680
–Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut—
–Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.100
Quite a witness, ain't he?

07:55.900 --> 08:00.916
Word on the street is, Omar ain't
nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.660
Street said little cocksucker
was over on the East Side…

08:03.700 --> 08:06.340
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.510
That's the word on the street, huh?

08:10.500 --> 08:14.988
Trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
We're in a court of law.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.700
Your Honor—

08:17.800 --> 08:21.660
Objection is noted and preserved
for the record, Mr Levy. Move on.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.300
Thank you, Your Honor.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.860
Jurors will disregard that last comment
from the witness in which he explained…

08:27.900 --> 08:30.804
where he had last
encountered the defendant.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.900
Yes or no, Mr Little?

08:33.000 --> 08:36.299
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.460
I knew the man,
but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.460
So you would have no trouble
recognizing him from a moderate distance…

08:43.500 --> 08:46.000
say 20,25 yards in daylight?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.100
No problem.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.200
Mr Little, do you recognize…

08:52.300 --> 08:53.900
this particular weapon?

08:54.400 --> 08:56.160
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the.380.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.860
–You've seen it before?
–Bird always flashing that thing.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.960
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.432
–And on the day in question?
–It was in Bird's hand.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.600
–When he shot at Mr Gant?
–Yes, ma'am.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.160
–Bird covet them shiny little pistols.
–Objection, Your Honor.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.860
And the boy too trifling to throw it off
even after a daytime murder.

09:18.900 --> 09:22.960
You're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!

09:23.000 --> 09:26.460
The defendant will regain control
or he will be forcibly restrained…

09:26.500 --> 09:28.282
and I will clear the court.

09:28.300 --> 09:33.052
The witness's last answer is to be stricken
and disregarded by the jury.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.100
Niko.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.900
Eton is my friend.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.400
It's good to have friends meet, no?

09:47.700 --> 09:48.800
Eton, huh?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.600
That's from the Greek, meaning what?

09:51.700 --> 09:53.800
No Greek. Israeli.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.400
Yeah?

09:57.300 --> 10:00.000
'Cause you look Greek, no offense.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Either way, I mean….

10:10.000 --> 10:14.092
–You have the chemicals?
–I can get them, as much as you want.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.200
When?

10:16.400 --> 10:20.560
I was gonna do something this week.
There's been a problem, though.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.600
–What problem?
–My cousin Ziggy.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.760
He got into a beef
with these East Baltimore guys.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.860
Drug dealer by the name of Cheese
took his car, burned it…

10:30.900 --> 10:34.464
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.700
Yeah, malaka, right.
Zig fucked up the package.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.700
So, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.100
Then you pay your debt.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.700
It was $2,700, right?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.356
Now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5,400, you believe that?

10:57.400 --> 10:58.918
First he takes the car…

10:59.000 --> 11:01.460
and now he's jacking us around
on the money.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.700
–You want, we kill him.
–No.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.610
–That ain't it either, no.
–Why no?

11:10.400 --> 11:13.964
'Cause first of all, Zig fucked it up.
He owes $2,700.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.900
And second, you kill Cheese…

11:17.000 --> 11:19.660
and we're gonna have a fight
with his people, right?

11:19.700 --> 11:20.860
A year down the road…

11:20.900 --> 11:23.560
some nigger sees my cousin
coming out the burger shop…

11:23.600 --> 11:27.860
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue,
no questions, puts a cap in his ass.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.700
He's smart, huh? Niko, smart.

11:36.400 --> 11:40.822
We don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy, make things right.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.316
I was hoping maybe you do.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.200
Mr Little…

11:50.200 --> 11:53.104
can I ask why you came forward
in this case?

11:53.300 --> 11:57.986
–I told the police what I know.
–Were you offered anything in exchange?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.700
–Like what?
–Were you arrested?

12:02.100 --> 12:05.160
Were you going to be charged with a crime,
and by testifying…

12:05.200 --> 12:08.038
did the police agree to drop those charges?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.544
No, man, it ain't even about that.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.760
How many times have you been arrested
as an adult, Mr Little?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.500
Shoot, I done lost count.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.560
Enough, though, not to take it personal.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.300
Possession of a handgun…

12:22.300 --> 12:25.460
possessing a concealed weapon,
assault by pointing…

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
robbery, deadly weapon,
possession of a handgun again…

12:29.700 --> 12:33.000
followed by violation of parole
on weapon charges…

12:33.800 --> 12:35.960
followed by
one count of attempted murder…

12:36.000 --> 12:39.102
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.280
That wasn't no attempt murder.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.300
What was it, Mr Little?

12:44.600 --> 12:48.098
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hind parts, that all.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.300
Fixed it so he couldn't sit right.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.700
Why'd you shoot Mike-Mike
in his hind parts?

12:57.200 --> 13:00.260
–Let's say we had a disagreement.
–A disagreement over?

13:00.300 --> 13:03.560
Mike-Mike thought he should keep
that cocaine he was slinging…

13:03.600 --> 13:06.570
and the money
he was making from slinging it.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.300
I thought otherwise.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.300
So you rob drug dealers?
This is what you do.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.400
Yes, sir.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.500
You walk the streets of Baltimore
with a gun…

13:19.600 --> 13:22.060
taking what you want, when you want it…

13:22.100 --> 13:24.960
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.700
This is who you are.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.172
Why should we believe
your testimony then?

13:31.300 --> 13:35.194
–Why believe anything you say?
–That's up to y'all, really.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.660
You say you aren't here
testifying against the defendant…

13:38.700 --> 13:41.960
–because of any deal you made with police.
–True that.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.960
That you are here
because you want to tell the truth…

13:45.000 --> 13:48.460
about what happened to Mr Gant
in that housing project parking lot.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.500
Yup.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.760
When in fact you are exactly
the kind of person who would…

13:52.800 --> 13:54.516
if you felt you needed to…

13:54.600 --> 13:56.960
shoot a man down
on a housing project parking lot…

13:57.000 --> 13:59.560
and then lie to the police about it,
would you not?

13:59.600 --> 14:02.570
Look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.800
You are amoral, are you not?

14:06.700 --> 14:10.560
You are feeding off the violence
and the despair of the drug trade.

14:10.600 --> 14:15.060
You are stealing from those who themselves
are stealing the lifeblood from our city.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.260
–You are a parasite who leeches off…
–Just like you, man.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.900
the culture of drugs…. Excuse me? What?

14:21.000 --> 14:25.500
I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.800
It's all in the game, though, right?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.360
And with the economy, what it is…

14:35.400 --> 14:38.460
you can really consider coming in
10% or 20% below asking…

14:38.500 --> 14:39.760
and still feel competitive.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.034
–Even on the Hamburg Street address?
–Absolutely.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.872
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.660
Although I didn't like the color
of the whirlpool tub…

14:48.700 --> 14:50.660
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?

14:50.700 --> 14:53.460
–That's cosmetic.
–If they want to make the sale…

14:53.500 --> 14:56.260
they should have some amount
of couth to change the color.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.006
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.560
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just keep looking.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.560
We shouldn't settle for just anything.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.560
And you think that there will be
some new open houses this Sunday?

15:08.600 --> 15:11.460
–I'm sorry, what were you saying?
–We're gonna keep looking.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.932
–You'll take us around again on Sunday?
–Definitely.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.500
–Okay then, see you Sunday, early.
–Great.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.900
Thank you.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.400
I'll see you then.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.800
You are a child, you know that?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.574
–What do you want?
–Dinner and a movie.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
–Come on, stop it.
–Why not?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.160
This isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.660
Dinner and a movie,
then I'll walk you to the door…

15:42.700 --> 15:46.060
and you tell me to go fuck myself
like you should've done way back when.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.760
How about I tell you to fuck yourself
here and now?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.860
Then you can save that money
for someone else.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.530
Come on, Elena.
Come on, I signed all your damn papers.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.400
Give me another shot.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.300
Friday. You pay for the sitter.

16:12.800 --> 16:17.200
–So how that DC. game, man?
–Same as it ever was.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.460
Chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.600
Call it Drama City nowadays.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.600
Otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.402
Same soup, just reheated,
know what I'm saying?

16:31.100 --> 16:34.660
If you need anything to make this happen,
you gotta get it yourself.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.614
I can't go through my people.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.960
If Stringer Bell reaching
all the way past Baltimore…

16:40.000 --> 16:41.518
with this kind of work…

16:41.600 --> 16:44.636
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?

16:45.500 --> 16:49.700
Don't worry, no mistakes.
Nothing that might come back on you.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.034
–You sure of your people?
–My cousin up in there…

16:53.200 --> 16:54.900
–he on it.
–All right.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.042
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.416
Ain't heard it live, then.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.859
I know a club in Oxon Hill
that would wreck y'all.

17:04.900 --> 17:05.900
All right.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.099
If I'm around the way.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.599
So, how you doing?

17:14.900 --> 17:18.000
–Nursing school right now.
–Good, that's good.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.460
Lester's been pushing me, you know.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.960
He does it, kind of without you knowing
that he's doing it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.800
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.960
He said that you would be by today
to talk about the clubs.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
About some girls, Russian.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.760
–Or from that part of the world.
–The ones on the circuit, yeah.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.860
You should try this place called Nightshift
down off of Holabird.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.560
I have a friend who works there.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.260
She worked with a bunch of Russian girls
last year for about three months.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.270
–Think she'll talk to me?
–Only if I ask her.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.260
Thank you, Detective, nothing further.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.860
–Anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
–No, Your Honor.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.560
Let's take 10 minutes
and then run the closing arguments.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.760
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow…

17:57.800 --> 17:59.400
with jury instructions.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.710
–How'd Omar do?
–You didn't see it?

18:05.900 --> 18:09.200
Not the cross. That bad?

19:02.400 --> 19:05.500
–You have no problem.
–No?

19:05.900 --> 19:09.500
To start, he wants you to pay $5,400.
Then we talk.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.354
–He says, “No, you pay just the $2,700.”
–Yeah, I saw how you talked.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.000
But you will not pay the $2,700.

19:17.100 --> 19:20.730
Instead you will get the money
for the car that burned.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.500
–Yeah?
–Yeah.

19:23.600 --> 19:28.200
Him we don't know.
But the one he calls boss, him we know.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.900
You gonna sit there and pout?

19:41.300 --> 19:45.360
I know you don't think I'm going down
to that club just to look at pussy.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.776
I know you know me better than that.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.104
–I ain't even looking.
–Everybody's looking.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.060
–Most of them women are dykes.
–Cheryl, it's police work.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.560
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?

20:00.600 --> 20:03.966
Kima's out on the street
doing her detective thing?

20:05.600 --> 20:09.400
All that hospital shit, all that rehab…

20:10.300 --> 20:12.860
–all them promises—
–We talked about this.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.400
No, you talked.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.860
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

20:17.900 --> 20:21.794
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.500
–Where you going?
–With you.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.300
Excuse me?

20:35.400 --> 20:39.294
Who knows? I might see a little something
I happen to like.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.860
So all of that's on the table?

20:41.900 --> 20:44.560
There's money in the transport budget
for the grain pier.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.160
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging…

20:47.200 --> 20:48.460
on the main shipping channel.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.206
–But not the canal?
–Nope, not the canal.

20:51.300 --> 20:54.560
For that we'll have to fight
a little longer and dig a little deeper.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.800
So says Frank.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.160
I gotta say, for my money,
we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.560
Be that as it may,
we spent the money and took our best shot.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.460
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions…

21:05.500 --> 21:06.860
paid for a consultant's report…

21:06.900 --> 21:09.160
to argue against
some of the environmental stuff.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.260
It cost, but we're starting to see it.

21:11.300 --> 21:15.860
–So where y'all find the cash?
–I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.100
Seriously.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.760
We got some help
from the national office on this.

21:19.800 --> 21:23.160
There've been some timely donations
from a few friends here and there.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.160
The point is, at the very least…

21:25.200 --> 21:27.860
we're likely to see
the grain pier back up by next year…

21:27.900 --> 21:30.660
which means a couple hundred
more ships a year, at least.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.760
–If.
–And it's a big fucking “if.”

21:32.800 --> 21:35.110
–If that Polack motherfucker—
–Hey.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.900
No offense.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.060
If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up
waterfront condominiums first, right?

21:41.100 --> 21:44.960
Nat's right. The back door threat
is that Andy Kraw or some other developer…

21:45.000 --> 21:48.460
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.560
Those guys are looking at that location, too.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.860
So we need everybody making phone calls.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.660
Let your legislators know
that we're watching on this.

21:55.700 --> 21:59.924
The money only goes so far.
Now we gotta make some noise, right?

22:00.400 --> 22:02.160
–Make some noise.
–Okay, enough talk.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.360
Some of youse got ships
to work in the morning.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.162
–The rest of youse need to be drunk.
–I'll drink to that.

22:15.800 --> 22:20.156
Help from the national office, huh?
Timely donations from friends?

22:20.400 --> 22:22.300
Watch your ass, Frank.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.500
–This is it?
–Yeah.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.760
Just picked it up
from the port administrator.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.260
So what am I looking at?

22:33.300 --> 22:36.660
The Atlantic Light on the day
the can with the women was offloaded.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.600
The boxes are containers.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.860
This one's being offloaded
and set on a chassis.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.814
Here's the time: 10:31 hours.

22:45.900 --> 22:49.300
See? It was moved to Lane L,
Stack 6, Row 3…

22:49.400 --> 22:52.500
by an RTG at 10:37 hours.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.100
–RTG?
–Rubber tire gantry.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.100
So from ship to stack took six minutes.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.160
That's the way it's supposed to work, but….

23:02.200 --> 23:04.500
“AQQZ,” as in zebra…

23:05.600 --> 23:07.400
“396594.”

23:07.500 --> 23:09.200
Check digit, seven.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.060
That's the container number
of the can with the women in it.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.160
See that?
It was never entered by the checker.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.360
So as far as the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.660
Sobotka says that that can happen
when the radio waves get knocked down…

23:22.700 --> 23:25.260
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.

23:25.300 --> 23:29.100
It came off Atlantic Light at 11:26 hours.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.760
And it doesn't show up in the
computer again until 15:12 hours.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.846
I find it two hours after that.

23:35.300 --> 23:39.600
So for nearly four hours,
it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.860
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.660
When they get found,
they get put back into the computer.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.200
You believe him?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.700
No, not this can.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.300
So what's the plan?

23:53.400 --> 23:54.760
The database on this computer…

23:54.800 --> 23:57.260
has records for every ship
that berthed at Patapsco…

23:57.300 --> 23:58.900
over the last two years.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.660
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans…

24:01.700 --> 24:03.260
might've disappeared like that.

24:03.300 --> 24:07.260
–See if there's a pattern.
–How many ships we talking about?

24:08.400 --> 24:09.800
Hundreds.

24:12.900 --> 24:17.124
It ain't like I got a prayer of bringing
this case in otherwise.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.438
–That's what I'm talking about.
–All right.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.760
–What the hell is your problem?
–Nothing.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.760
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick
or something.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.800
I just can't look at them.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.360
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?

24:35.400 --> 24:38.800
Yeah, sure. But not with women.

24:39.100 --> 24:42.260
You're sure you're not gonna have
a problem for talking to us?

24:42.300 --> 24:46.160
I don't give a shit.
You friends with Shardene, all that matters.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.560
Besides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners straight-up…

24:49.600 --> 24:51.360
I was here before them ho's got here…

24:51.400 --> 24:53.760
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.

24:53.800 --> 24:58.260
–So how long ago did they came through?
–Six months back was the last batch.

24:58.300 --> 25:01.060
Russians, I think,
but shit all sound the same…

25:01.100 --> 25:03.360
when you can't understand
a damn word, right?

25:03.400 --> 25:07.000
–Who brought them?
–Club owner pays extra for them.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.800
There was a woman…

25:08.900 --> 25:10.960
she was like the madam
who handled the cash.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.660
–But I ain't get a name.
–She Russian, too?

25:13.700 --> 25:16.400
She was something. She had an accent.

25:16.900 --> 25:20.160
So it's like, one day all Baltimore girls
are at the bar…

25:20.200 --> 25:21.700
and the next, what?

25:21.800 --> 25:24.308
–All foreign girls?
–That about right.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.760
They was making so much money
with them new girls…

25:26.800 --> 25:28.860
they let some of their regular dancers go.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.560
Not me,  'cause I mean, I got clientele here.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.900
–But some of the others….
–Where'd the girls stay?

25:35.300 --> 25:38.560
Where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
They don't know shit.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.060
They ain't got no family.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.960
The men they got handling them
are always with them.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.560
Right there to take them
from whatever motel they use…

25:45.600 --> 25:46.986
to the club and back.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.860
Right there when they need to get food,
or go to the Rite Aid.

25:49.900 --> 25:53.560
Right outside the motel door
when they up in them rooms with the johns.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.400
Anyone try to get away?

25:55.600 --> 25:59.060
Shit, I seen one of them get lit up
with one of them stun guns…

25:59.100 --> 26:01.160
for going down the block
to get some dinner.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.460
They barely let them girls
go to the bathroom by themselves.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.160
And if they see one getting
too close to the johns…

26:07.200 --> 26:09.860
that's when they move the whole crew
to another town.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.300
Keep it so they don't get no help.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.460
You up after the next song.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.734
Push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.

26:18.900 --> 26:23.000
You need anything else, you can call me.
Help if I can.

26:23.400 --> 26:25.500
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.260
She must be doing good,
to be out for so long.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.900
She must've landed a rich one, right?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.000
–You her girl?
–Yeah.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.660
I wouldn't let mine come in here either
without me.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.400
These bitches in here are no joke.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.022
Thirteen of them.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.560
They had about a third of that space
hidden behind the fake wall.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.300
A few flashlights, some junk food,
some water.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.676
A portable toilet they had to share.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.700
And not enough air.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.960
I'm going to schedule sentencing
for the third week of next month.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.500
Anything else today?

28:41.000 --> 28:44.560
Your Honor, my client,
having preserved the necessary grounds…

28:44.600 --> 28:47.560
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state unequivocally…

28:47.600 --> 28:49.460
that regardless of this jury's verdict…

28:49.500 --> 28:53.260
he is the victim of wholesale perjury
on the part of the state's key witness.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.260
We ask that an appeal bond be set…

28:55.300 --> 28:57.960
so that he can participate fully
in this investigation.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.460
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?

29:00.500 --> 29:02.860
–Mr Levy, get a grip on yourself.
–Your Honor—

29:02.900 --> 29:05.760
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing…

29:05.800 --> 29:07.460
but as far as I'm concerned…

29:07.500 --> 29:10.160
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.

29:10.200 --> 29:14.226
Mr Hilton has been found guilty
of killing a state's witness…

29:14.300 --> 29:16.900
who testified in this very courtroom.

29:17.100 --> 29:20.100
He did so in cold blood, and for pay.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.560
Unless the pre-sentence report
indicates that he is, in fact…

29:23.600 --> 29:25.118
the Messiah come again…

29:25.200 --> 29:28.260
he will very likely be sentenced
to life, no parole…

29:28.300 --> 29:30.960
by a Baltimore judge who,
for once in his life…

29:31.000 --> 29:34.060
gets to leave his office feeling
that his job actually matters.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.960
Mr Hilton, are you the second coming
of our savior?

29:37.000 --> 29:40.498
–Excuse me?
–Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?

29:42.200 --> 29:44.000
See you at sentencing.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.400
Was it good for you, too?

29:55.400 --> 29:58.660
Mr Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free
one time only…

29:58.700 --> 30:01.142
on anything up to aggravated assault.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.908
–Why thank you, ma'am.
–No, thank you.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.000
A rare pleasure.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.060
Time for the ceremonial eyefuck.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.660
Come see me down the Cut,
you punk-ass snitch.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.260
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksucking throat!

30:18.300 --> 30:19.660
You think on it, Bird.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.760
You think on Brandon
while you doing that time?

30:21.800 --> 30:26.560
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
Fuck that, I'll do you like a dog.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.778
You really see him shoot the man?

30:30.500 --> 30:31.900
You really asking?

30:36.800 --> 30:40.826
But it's fucked because the man
got to where he needed to be…

30:41.300 --> 30:43.214
and she wasn't even worth it.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.860
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch,
anyway, you know?

30:46.900 --> 30:51.700
And he did all that for her and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.660
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts in American lives.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.560
–Do you believe that?
–Man, shit, we locked up.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.300
We best not believe that, right?

31:02.900 --> 31:05.804
He's saying that the past is always with us.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.660
And where we come from,
what we go through…

31:08.700 --> 31:11.900
how we go through it, all that shit matters.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.866
–I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
–Go ahead.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.158
Like at the end of the book, you know?
Boats and tides and all.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.760
It's like you can change up, right?

31:26.800 --> 31:30.960
You can say you're somebody new,
you can give yourself a whole new story…

31:31.000 --> 31:33.900
but what came first is who you really are…

31:34.600 --> 31:37.834
and what happened before
is what really happened.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.960
And it don't matter
that some fool say he different…

31:41.000 --> 31:43.360
'cause the only thing
that can make you different…

31:43.400 --> 31:45.760
is what you really do
or what you really go through.

31:45.800 --> 31:49.200
Like, you know,
like all them books in his library.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.042
Now, he fronting with all them books…

31:53.800 --> 31:58.560
but if we pull one down off the shelf,
ain't none of the pages ever been opened.

31:58.600 --> 32:02.428
He got all them books,
and he ain't read near one of them.

32:03.800 --> 32:08.000
Gatsby, he was who he was,
and he did what he did…

32:09.000 --> 32:12.564
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story…

32:15.400 --> 32:17.182
that shit caught up to him.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.200
I think, anyway.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.900
Sorry, homey.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.200
You done with your trial?

32:47.100 --> 32:50.400
–All right then, let's take her on out.
–Tomorrow.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.160
–I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
–You got something else to do today?

32:54.200 --> 32:56.000
Yeah, last bit of business.

32:56.900 --> 33:00.400
–This is your business.
–This is retirement.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.200
And after today, I'm retired.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.900
Talk when I say, not before.

33:25.700 --> 33:29.400
–Tovarich.
–Serge, my nigger.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.500
–You're losing weight.
–Shit.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.200
You are down to nothing.

33:35.300 --> 33:38.270
In this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.560
–I worry for you, buddy.
–How your peoples, dog?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.500
Same, good.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.060
You talk to the man
about that other thing, right?

33:46.100 --> 33:48.660
Because I can get behind
that business in a big way.

33:48.700 --> 33:52.500
–We will talk later. Now, another business.
–Right.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.106
This the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?

33:56.200 --> 34:00.160
Wasn't mine, it was my cousin's.
It wasn't all that raggedy.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.600
Sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin….

34:09.100 --> 34:10.947
But family cannot be helped.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.400
Who you telling?

34:12.500 --> 34:16.960
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws
fucking all my shit up all the time.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.260
And it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass
and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.

34:21.300 --> 34:25.000
For real, I'm living life
with some burdensome niggers.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.800
So what the fuck?

34:32.000 --> 34:35.659
You ain't pay my boy Cheese,
and Cheese ain't paying me, right?

34:35.699 --> 34:38.260
I ain't talking
about all the money in the world.

34:38.300 --> 34:41.460
But it ain't like Cheese be in a position
out on that corner…

34:41.500 --> 34:44.400
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?

34:45.100 --> 34:46.659
The man cut you some slack…

34:46.699 --> 34:49.159
and soon every fucking-up white boy
be on his titty.

34:49.199 --> 34:52.103
We wanna pay what we owe.
The $2,700 anyway.

34:52.300 --> 34:55.460
–We're gonna have it soon enough.
–Your man doubled it, though.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.100
He also burned the car.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.104
Now the blue book
on that Camaro was $5,100.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.200
Now, let me understand.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.960
You gonna come up in here,
having fucked up a package…

35:07.000 --> 35:10.060
asking me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on…

35:10.100 --> 35:12.200
to pay you out $2,400.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.500
He gets to keep the Camaro.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.698
Just how good a friend
is this motherfucker to y'all?

35:24.000 --> 35:27.260
The Cheese ain't gonna be happy
having to pay me back…

35:27.300 --> 35:30.700
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.740
Just so he don't come back on my cousin.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.800
Anyway, thanks for being straight on this.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.200
Fool, if it wasn't for Serge here…

35:43.300 --> 35:46.996
you and your cuz both would
be cadaverous motherfuckers.

35:52.800 --> 35:57.024
I went through INS, customs,
even the State Department. Nothing.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.800
It's time, Jimmy.
You did what you could, right?

36:12.100 --> 36:13.816
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.770
This one to the anatomy board
in the morning.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.400
Jane Doe on the paperwork.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.400
–Ain't right, Doc.
–What the fuck ever is?

36:32.700 --> 36:34.300
You leave it to Avon…

36:34.500 --> 36:36.960
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.700
No doubt, knowing Avon.

36:41.100 --> 36:42.700
It's all good, D

36:43.400 --> 36:46.900
Just show up,
and say what Levy tells you to.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.700
What the hell is wrong with you?

36:52.400 --> 36:53.500
I'm asking you.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.200
Those hot shots, that was Avon.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.000
I want you home, D

37:03.500 --> 37:06.404
You asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.960
–This is mine, right here, right now.
–Boy, you ain't listening to me.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.600
–I am telling you—
–Ma.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.160
You remember we used
to lived on Linden Avenue?

37:15.200 --> 37:16.700
Remember that house?

37:18.000 --> 37:21.100
I was about 6 or 7 years old.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.500
I was playing on the porch.

37:24.400 --> 37:28.600
Them twins came by,
started picking on me, messing with me.

37:30.300 --> 37:31.500
Remember that?

37:33.300 --> 37:36.060
I'm banging on the door,
trying to get inside…

37:36.100 --> 37:38.760
and you standing right there
to open the door…

37:38.800 --> 37:41.200
except you ain't letting me inside.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.968
You told me to go back out there
and fight them…

37:45.000 --> 37:46.500
whether I lose or not.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.700
Remember?

37:51.300 --> 37:54.300
–They beat the shit out of you.
–Yeah.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.200
Then you say to me:

37:57.300 --> 38:01.100
“Boy, I might have brung you
into this world…

38:01.600 --> 38:04.636
but you the one
who gonna have to live in it.”

38:05.800 --> 38:08.000
Ma, I'm still here.

38:08.800 --> 38:12.500
Me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.700
You tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette…

38:18.100 --> 38:20.600
all of them, to leave me be.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.504
All right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.606
–Come on, we're almost through 2002.
–No.

39:04.600 --> 39:09.200
–Tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
–Yeah.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.678
They look thirsty, a round on me.

39:23.700 --> 39:26.472
Yo, Mr Sobotka,
friend to the working man…

39:26.500 --> 39:27.900
master of the game.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.060
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?

39:31.100 --> 39:34.000
–Been here long?
–Since my hair was brown.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.500
I was telling Chess about Benny.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.760
–Benny with the harelip?
–That's a good one.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.860
See, Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.760
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.460
Not until he came in here.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.360
That's when Little Nose told Benny
to call the union lawyer.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.700
–Paul Sevel?
–Yeah.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.200
God rest his soul.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.660
So Benny calls Paul.

39:53.700 --> 39:56.700
“Me been hit with a 'ackerel,” Benny says.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.200
“A mackerel?

39:58.300 --> 40:00.260
You working frozen foods again?”
Paul says.

40:00.300 --> 40:03.800
“No,  'oddamn it, a 'ackerel.”

40:04.600 --> 40:06.700
Then he slams the phone down.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.600
“'Other 'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.800
Says he can't undertan' me.”

40:12.300 --> 40:14.940
Little Nose says, “Why he wanna do that?

40:15.000 --> 40:18.036
Benny don't talk
no fucking better in person.”

40:22.200 --> 40:25.000
So that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?

40:25.100 --> 40:26.600
Yeah, you're straight.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.700
That there's $2,400 for Princess.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.014
She was worth more than that.

40:33.500 --> 40:36.300
Dolo. One for the bar, hon.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.700
You win the lotto?

40:38.800 --> 40:42.166
If my old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?

40:44.600 --> 40:49.500
–What the fuck is wrong with you?
–Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.

40:50.300 --> 40:54.062
–We ain't gonna live forever, right?
–Next round's on me.

40:57.900 --> 41:02.500
–Not for me, I'm gonna head out.
–Come on, Frank, belly up.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.500
Take a rain check.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.300
–And that one as well, huh?
–Makes 22.

41:14.500 --> 41:18.160
All on the Talco line.
All with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.

41:18.200 --> 41:21.800
–We're on it then.
–You gonna call Bunk?

41:23.700 --> 41:26.200
Detective Moreland is indisposed.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.600
–You with Daniels and them?
–No.

41:36.400 --> 41:40.360
We just parked the computer down there.
We're orphaned, man.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.200
–Orphaned?
–Yeah.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.100
Rawls is talking like…

41:47.200 --> 41:50.400
if I don't come home with 14 clearances…

41:51.200 --> 41:55.200
I can't come home at all. Lester, too.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.700
Where's the love, Jimmy?

41:59.000 --> 42:03.100
Where is the motherfucking love?

42:22.100 --> 42:24.608
–So what's up with you, man?
–Nothing.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.300
Nothing, huh?

42:29.200 --> 42:32.764
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird is my last piece of old business.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.100
I got nothing new.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.110
I was trying for an ID on this one…

42:41.600 --> 42:43.580
and I can't even tell you why.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.894
Just a way to pretend
I was still a murder police, I guess.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.600
Who gives a fuck, right?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.500
Elena and I are gonna try again.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Shit.

43:04.100 --> 43:08.100
I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.800
Come on, man, let's go home.

43:16.700 --> 43:18.300
All right, man.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.200
Over here, shitbird.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.380
What the hell happened to you?

43:41.400 --> 43:44.100
–I fell down.
–How many times?

43:48.500 --> 43:49.600
Let's walk.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.680
–Pop, I'm—
–Walk with me, Zig.

43:57.100 --> 44:01.060
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back online by next spring.

44:01.100 --> 44:05.000
–More ships, more work.
–Yeah, great.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.900
–What the fuck are you about?
–What?

44:13.100 --> 44:15.960
Is that my son lighting
hundred dollar bills like an asshole…

44:16.000 --> 44:18.112
in a bar full of working stiffs?

44:18.200 --> 44:21.200
–What the fuck is that?
–Just a smile.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.200
–A smile?
–Yep, a smile.

44:27.900 --> 44:31.266
You wanna hit me again, Pop,
go ahead, take a shot.

44:33.500 --> 44:37.060
Where you come by that kind of cash?
You know you ain't had the days.

44:37.100 --> 44:38.600
Definitely not.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.460
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.460
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.500
Seniority prevails, Zig.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.960
–It's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
–I know, I ain't complaining.

44:50.000 --> 44:54.060
I wish I could give you more.
You don't think I want to throw you more?

44:54.100 --> 44:56.938
–You throw plenty.
–It's just, Christ, Zig.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.160
If I'd listened to your mother,
she's the one always talking about—

45:00.200 --> 45:01.200
It's cool.

45:01.300 --> 45:03.460
You should do community college
like your brother.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.400
Pop, don't.

45:08.100 --> 45:10.400
You wanna know what I remember?

45:11.400 --> 45:12.500
Do you?

45:14.400 --> 45:18.200
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry…

45:18.300 --> 45:20.400
and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop…

45:22.300 --> 45:26.760
all sitting around the kitchen table,
talking shit about this gang and that gang…

45:26.800 --> 45:29.000
who's better with the break-bulk…

45:29.100 --> 45:32.500
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.

45:33.200 --> 45:37.358
–Always a fucking argument, right?
–Four Polacks, six opinions.

45:39.800 --> 45:43.260
I remember when youse all
went down to picket them scabs…

45:43.300 --> 45:45.000
at Covington Piers…

45:45.300 --> 45:48.402
how Jackie Taylor got run over
by a police car…

45:48.500 --> 45:51.206
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.

45:52.100 --> 45:54.760
I remember when the Paceco
fell during that windstorm.

45:54.800 --> 45:57.800
You remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.

45:58.700 --> 46:00.614
Yeah, what else you remember?

46:01.200 --> 46:02.500
Everything.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.100
So tell me, Mr “Back In The Day”…

46:21.600 --> 46:23.960
what are we doing down here
with the wharf rats…

46:24.000 --> 46:26.400
in the middle of the goddamn night?

46:26.500 --> 46:28.100
Beats the fuck outta me.

46:36.100 --> 46:39.060
Every one of those Post-its
is a can that disappears…

46:39.100 --> 46:40.460
when it's being offloaded.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.860
The yellow slips, they show up again…

46:42.900 --> 46:45.160
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered…

46:45.200 --> 46:47.260
so you figure those are honest mistakes.

46:47.300 --> 46:50.060
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.860
They stay out of the computer for good.

46:51.900 --> 46:54.260
And the pink one,
like the can full of dead girls…

46:54.300 --> 46:56.560
they're all from
the same shipping line, Talco…

46:56.600 --> 46:59.560
and on all of them, the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa…

46:59.600 --> 47:02.500
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.960
You went at him already, right?

47:05.000 --> 47:08.960
We grand juried his ass,
but that motherfucker didn't blink.

47:18.100 --> 47:21.664
You wanna hit the head?
Get yourself right, Detective?

47:23.200 --> 47:24.500
No, I'm good.

47:27.900 --> 47:31.800
The point is, we have a pattern here.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.260
What they're doing eliminates
almost all of the paper trail.

47:35.300 --> 47:38.060
As long as they can get
a truck past the outbound lanes…

47:38.100 --> 47:41.660
and there's a dozen ways to do that,
the only thing they leave behind…

47:41.700 --> 47:43.560
is a little telltale in the computer.

47:43.600 --> 47:47.360
A box comes off the ship,
flashes for a few moments and blip…

47:47.400 --> 47:48.600
then it's gone.

47:52.900 --> 47:55.900
Our target
is supposed to be Sobotka, right?

47:56.100 --> 47:57.700
I mean, on paper anyway.

47:58.800 --> 48:01.660
What you're telling me is
that it's better than a fair bet…

48:01.700 --> 48:04.802
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.

48:11.600 --> 48:14.760
Maybe we can fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.

48:14.800 --> 48:18.360
And put my ass in the air with
14 open homicides that might never clear?

48:18.400 --> 48:22.060
–The bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
–I wouldn't shine either.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.460
I'm using what we do with this detail
to get a major case squad going.

48:25.500 --> 48:30.450
I come up out of here with all those
open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.

48:30.900 --> 48:33.760
–So what's the next move on this?
–We clone the computer…

48:33.800 --> 48:37.892
and start watching
what's happening on the docks in real time.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.700
Shit.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.700
Yo, D

49:27.100 --> 49:28.400
Just wine, huh?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.500
I'm not drinking much anymore.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.500
No Jameson's?

49:34.800 --> 49:37.638
Maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.060
Okay, I deserve that one, too…

49:40.100 --> 49:43.260
even though I'm not doing
much of that anymore either.

49:43.300 --> 49:45.700
–Anything else?
–I'm sorry.

49:46.500 --> 49:49.060
I don't know where it still comes from.
It's been a year.

49:49.100 --> 49:52.532
–You deserve to be angry.
–What's the point, though?

49:55.500 --> 49:56.800
How's work?

49:58.900 --> 50:01.060
What, so we talk about
everything in my life…

50:01.100 --> 50:02.500
that pisses you off?

50:02.700 --> 50:06.792
–Drinking, women, the work?
–Just trying to make conversation.

50:08.400 --> 50:11.600
–I retired.
–Excuse me?

50:14.500 --> 50:16.700
It's boats, not bodies.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.968
On a good day,
I catch crabs and count seagulls.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.200
–That's not you.
–It wasn't me.

50:25.700 --> 50:28.868
It wasn't me not to drink,
or dog around either.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.300
A lot of things weren't me.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.400
I want another chance.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.400
How about a fuck for the road instead?

51:25.100 --> 51:26.600
–How you doing?
–Okay.

51:26.700 --> 51:29.360
You unload this,
you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.

51:29.400 --> 51:32.400
Make it look like it was a hijack, all right?

51:33.100 --> 51:34.200
Niko.

51:36.400 --> 51:39.600
If you want, I will pay you straight…

51:40.100 --> 51:43.800
or Eton can pay in heroin.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.800
Wholesale.

51:50.500 --> 51:54.300
Turn it around,
you can make $60,000 or $70,000.

51:55.500 --> 52:00.100
Nicky, he's offering, like,
three, four times the value.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.100
I'm out on this.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.300
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike…

52:08.400 --> 52:10.500
we can make $30,000 or $35,000.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.500
Nicky, come on, man.

52:22.500 --> 52:24.600
Half in cash, half in dope.

52:35.300 --> 52:38.060
Nicky, I can turn that package around,
no problem.

52:38.100 --> 52:40.160
–No, Zig, I got it.
–Nicky, you don't know—

52:40.200 --> 52:43.038
You hear me? I said I fucking got this one.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.160
Stay at home and watch cartoons.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.764
Let me handle this shit
for the both of us, all right?

52:56.300 --> 52:58.700
You fucking walking home or what?

53:09.900 --> 53:11.200
Hey, girl.

53:11.300 --> 53:13.600
–What do we do with the day?
–Me?

53:14.700 --> 53:18.400
–I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
–Okay, great.

53:18.700 --> 53:22.560
They're gonna be coming back here.
Michael has piano this afternoon.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.860
No problem, we'll do something after that.

53:24.900 --> 53:27.870
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.

53:30.200 --> 53:33.360
I don't want the boys to know
that you were here.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.600
It's gonna get them hoping.

53:36.700 --> 53:40.300
So you need to leave.

53:56.100 --> 53:58.000
Look at this sorry shit.

53:58.200 --> 54:02.226
Motherfuckers not appreciate
nothing that comes to them free.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.356
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.

54:40.300 --> 54:41.800
–D, right?
–Yeah.

54:41.900 --> 54:43.260
You can't be in here now, man.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.860
Yo, man, y'all get any final calls
this week, yo?

54:45.900 --> 54:48.860
–Yeah, we got some.
–I didn't see any out there.

54:48.900 --> 54:50.160
All right, give me a minute.

54:50.200 --> 54:54.952
Let me finish up right here real quick,
and I'll go and get one for you.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.060
–Hey, y'all.
–What's up?

56:31.100 --> 56:33.900
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.060
–You trying to curb me, yo?
–Come on.

56:36.100 --> 56:37.600
What's in there?

56:38.305 --> 56:44.494
