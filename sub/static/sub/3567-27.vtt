Wow.
Those water constructs really

00:30.089 --> 00:32.390
did a number on Greg's van.
Hmm.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.993
<i>Eh, give it a rest, Pearl.</i>

00:35.077 --> 00:37.212
That thing will be busted forever.

00:37.296 --> 00:40.152
I completely disagree.
It's just a simple

00:40.153 --> 00:42.834
human machine. I'm sure
I can figure this whole

00:42.918 --> 00:44.868
- thing out before you know it.
- Hey, guys!

00:44.917 --> 00:47.085
Zoop!
I've got something that'll patch

00:47.119 --> 00:49.621
this van up real good.

00:49.672 --> 00:52.218
Is it some kind of complex human tool?

00:52.303 --> 00:54.804
Yep ... high-quality duct tape.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.641
Some well-placed duct tape can
patch anything up in a pinch.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.977
- See?
- I'm sure I can fix

01:01.028 --> 01:02.979
- this without your tape.
- Well, gee.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.980
Let me at least give
you a hand.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.401
- Uh, dad, be careful!
- Whew!

01:07.452 --> 01:10.120
I'm sorry you hurt your
leg and your van got all

01:10.204 --> 01:12.906
- smashed up because of me.
- You apologizetoo much.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.458
Maybe I shouldn't
have tagged along on

01:15.459 --> 01:18.128
that crazy adventure, but
at least I got to spend some

01:18.212 --> 01:20.797
- time with my fave guy.
- What if you stayed

01:20.915 --> 01:23.717
- with us until you got better?
- Hey, that's a great idea!

01:23.751 --> 01:25.969
But won't I get in the way of
your training?

01:26.053 --> 01:27.821
- Yes.
- Wait.

01:27.889 --> 01:29.990
Steven, don't you have
healing powers now?

01:30.057 --> 01:32.826
Oh, right! Yes!
You fix Greg. I'll fix the van.

01:32.894 --> 01:35.679
Nobody has to live with us.

01:35.763 --> 01:36.980
Yeah!
Hmm-hmm!

01:37.064 --> 01:39.733
Here goes something new and exciting.

01:39.801 --> 01:43.653
Hmm! Mm!
And... go!

01:46.232 --> 01:48.992
Okay. You should be better now.

01:49.076 --> 01:52.662
Okay. If you say so.

01:52.747 --> 01:54.448
- Ugh-ahh!
- Dad!

01:54.532 --> 01:56.783
- Why didn't it work?
- Hey, sorry, buddy.

01:56.851 --> 01:59.085
Maybe you just need a little
more practice.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.588
But I was doing so well before.

02:01.656 --> 02:06.009
Steven, don't worry about it.
Your powers are a bit fickle, after all.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.127
Just give it a bit more time.

02:08.179 --> 02:10.680
Cheer up, Steven.
At least now we get to spend

02:10.764 --> 02:14.134
- more time together, right?
- Y-yeah. Right.

02:14.218 --> 02:17.187

Ohh. Ahh.

03:55.286 --> 03:58.937
You're back.
The geode is cracked.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.157
- We must leave immediately.
- What?!

04:01.192 --> 04:03.243
- Oh, no.
- You, too, Steven.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.579
- Yeah!
- Oh, really?

04:05.663 --> 04:08.048
- Oh! Oh, yeah.
- It's okay, Steven.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.833
I'll be fine.
You go on your mission.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.607
- A-are you sure?
- Of course.

04:12.642 --> 04:13.290
Thanks, dad!

04:13.291 --> 04:15.305
- We'll be back before you know it!
- Okay.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.077
Don't worry about your old man.

04:17.079 --> 04:20.694
My leg's not getting any more broken.
If I need something,

04:20.761 --> 04:25.857
I'll just... crawl.
My arms are still not broken.

04:25.892 --> 04:28.998
- Amethyst: Oh, brother.
- Now, Greg, there's no

04:29.033 --> 04:31.237
need to be so pathetic.
If anything happens to you,

04:31.272 --> 04:33.239
you can call us with this.

04:33.424 --> 04:36.476
- What is it?
- It's a warp whistle.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.740
- Warp whistle.
- If you blow in it, the warp pad

04:39.741 --> 04:42.482
will activate and alert
us that we need to return.

04:42.566 --> 04:44.818
See, dad?
You'll be fine!

04:44.902 --> 04:47.270
Right. I'll be fine.

04:47.321 --> 04:51.441
Good luck on your mission, son.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.746
- Man. This place is janked up.
- Wow!

04:56.781 --> 04:58.748
Was there an explosion or
something?

04:58.783 --> 05:01.084
- Almost.
- What you're looking at

05:01.118 --> 05:03.253
is a synthetic storm that was
contained in ...

05:03.287 --> 05:06.084
Is that the warp whistle?

05:06.119 --> 05:10.009
Dad needs me!
I'll be right back!

05:10.094 --> 05:13.043
- Dad, I'm here! Is everything ...
- Hey, Steven!

05:13.044 --> 05:16.349
Just making sure this thing
actually works.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.968
Whew! Okay.
We'll be back later.

05:21.939 --> 05:25.024
- Sorry for the holdup!
- Is everything okay?

05:25.142 --> 05:28.444
Hey, did Greg fall
down and break his butt?

05:28.479 --> 05:31.314
- Ha ha ha!
- That's not funny.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.867
- I know.
- Like I was saying,

05:33.951 --> 05:35.902
this is a synthetic ...

05:35.986 --> 05:37.904
I'm sure it's very important.

05:37.988 --> 05:42.608
- Dad?!
- I'm really sorry, but...

05:42.609 --> 05:44.460
Where's the remote?

05:44.495 --> 05:48.598
That's actually a
very important question.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.867
It was very important.

05:50.935 --> 05:53.386
Okay. So, if the
geode breaks, the storm

05:53.387 --> 05:55.939
will be unleashed and our
bodies will be vaporized.

05:56.006 --> 05:59.602
- Then we'd be dead.
- That's where you come in.

05:59.637 --> 06:02.304
- Say what?!
- You should try and

06:02.305 --> 06:05.615
- seal that crack with your healing powers.
- But... what if...

06:05.683 --> 06:08.184
- I can't do it?
- It won't hurt to try.

06:08.252 --> 06:10.153

06:25.119 --> 06:26.970
I knew this would happen...
just when I thought

06:26.971 --> 06:30.096
- I was getting better.
- Don't beat yourself up, Steven.

06:30.097 --> 06:32.027
Yeah!
Don't worry about it!

06:32.028 --> 06:34.344
- We'll find another way.
- Eh.

06:34.411 --> 06:37.096
You don't understand.
How am I supposed to call myself

06:37.181 --> 06:39.515
a Crystal Gem if I can't even ...

06:39.583 --> 06:42.485
Dad? Dad?!

06:42.586 --> 06:46.022
Da-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-d!

06:46.056 --> 06:48.608
Dad, are you okay?!
Answer me!

06:48.692 --> 06:52.706
Ahh! Steven!
You just missed the funniest

06:52.717 --> 06:55.648
- commercial.
- What?!

06:55.683 --> 06:57.433
It was that one for the dog

06:57.534 --> 07:00.470
treats where the dog's
dressed up like a doctor.

07:00.537 --> 07:03.072
If I ever get heartworms, I'm

07:03.173 --> 07:05.575
- eating those dog treats.
- Dad!

07:05.643 --> 07:09.045
You're only supposed to use
the warp whistle for real

07:09.113 --> 07:12.482
emergencies, like if you fell
down and broke your butt!

07:12.549 --> 07:15.184
Yeah. Sorry about that.

07:15.252 --> 07:17.420
It's okay.

07:17.488 --> 07:20.690
Uh... since you're here, you ...
you mind grabbing me

07:20.758 --> 07:23.993
- a snack from the Big Donut?
- Yeah. Sure thing.

07:24.061 --> 07:27.759
- I'll be right back, you guys.
- We'll be in the temple.

07:27.794 --> 07:28.564
We have to come up

07:28.632 --> 07:31.267
- with another plan ... quick.
- Yo, dude, no

07:31.335 --> 07:34.003
worries about earlier.
You'll get ahold of your powers

07:34.071 --> 07:36.940
- before you know it.
- Thanks, Amethyst.

07:37.007 --> 07:40.349
- Get me a croissant.
- Aww!

07:40.384 --> 07:43.546
I forgot to ask dad what
kind of donuts he wants.

07:43.647 --> 07:46.015
Ahh.
Hey, dad, I ...

07:49.215 --> 07:52.233
Olé!
Steven!

07:52.234 --> 07:54.624
Ha! You had me scared there,

07:54.675 --> 07:58.172
son. Didn't see you
standing in the doorway.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.430
Your old man's still got it!

08:00.497 --> 08:03.533
What, this?
I guess I couldn't wait for

08:03.600 --> 08:09.222
those donuts.
Oh. Oh, yeah.

08:09.306 --> 08:12.608
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Ouch!

08:12.643 --> 08:16.612
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
- Just stop, dad.

08:16.647 --> 08:20.801
I get what's going on.
Your leg's not broken at all, is it?

08:20.802 --> 08:22.986
It was broken, but you healed

08:23.070 --> 08:26.239
- it back at the car wash.
- You lied to me!

08:26.323 --> 08:28.324
- Now I can't do it anymore!
- What?!

08:28.409 --> 08:31.661
The gems needed me to
fix the broken rock, but my

08:31.745 --> 08:34.496
powers aren't working!
It ... it's because of you!

08:34.581 --> 08:37.667
- You messed with my head!
- No! I-I didn't mean for ...

08:37.717 --> 08:40.336
I just wanted to live with my son again!

08:40.386 --> 08:43.506
I really thought
I was getting better.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.009
I finally felt like a Crystal Gem!

08:46.060 --> 08:48.344
Now what if I can't do... anything?

08:48.429 --> 08:50.680
Steven, don't beat yourself up!

08:50.764 --> 08:54.792
- This is my fault!
- Yeah! Yeah, it is!

08:56.168 --> 08:58.654
Ugh!
What am I going to do?!

08:58.739 --> 09:01.240
My powers ... they're ...

09:04.495 --> 09:07.497
I'm sorry. I ...

09:07.531 --> 09:09.749
- Dad!
- It's time for me to fix

09:09.867 --> 09:12.201
- the trouble I've caused.
- No!

09:14.354 --> 09:18.041
Dad!

09:19.840 --> 09:21.377
Dad! Be careful!

09:21.428 --> 09:24.263
Don't worry, Steven! Your
old man's gonna ...

09:24.348 --> 09:26.432
- Dad!
- Ooh! Ahh! Uhh!

09:26.517 --> 09:28.818
- Ohh!
- Are you okay?

09:35.275 --> 09:38.394
Steven, get out of here!
I'm responsible for this!

09:38.479 --> 09:42.031
- No, you're not!
- But I messed up your powers!

09:42.116 --> 09:44.654
I did everything I'm not
supposed to do,

09:44.689 --> 09:48.071
- and now you can't heal!
- I healed you, right?

09:50.367 --> 09:54.007
Hey, get in there and patch things up,

09:54.008 --> 09:57.647
just like you patched up your old man!

09:59.779 --> 10:02.168
Double healing

10:02.252 --> 10:06.172
powers!

10:08.317 --> 10:10.810
It's still not working!

10:10.928 --> 10:14.180
Ah, forget it!
I've got another idea!

10:21.405 --> 10:24.607
There. See?
Almost as good as new.

10:29.279 --> 10:31.180
No way...

10:31.215 --> 10:34.339
- So, I've realigned the axles...
- I can't believe it!

10:34.374 --> 10:35.554
...replaced the spark plugs...

10:35.589 --> 10:37.392
- it's never looked this good!
- ...sealed the leaks in

10:37.427 --> 10:40.323
the intake manifold gaskets,
and recalibrated the timing belt.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.291
As long as you ease up on second

10:42.359 --> 10:44.193
Gear, your transmission should be fine.

10:44.294 --> 10:46.462
Pearl!
I can't thank you enough!

10:50.184 --> 10:53.136
So, uh, now that I'm feeling

10:53.220 --> 10:55.388
better, it's about
time I move back home.

10:55.472 --> 10:59.714
Can't have me messing
up more magic stuff.

11:01.278 --> 11:03.196
Just in case you have trouble again.

11:04.648 --> 11:08.384
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, Steven!
