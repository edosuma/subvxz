WEBVTT

00:12.946 --> 00:16.717
1,100 rounds per minute--
that is just beautiful.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.419
Leave it to the Belgians,

00:18.486 --> 00:19.353
right?

00:19.420 --> 00:23.224
Waffles, chocolate
and badass field weaponry.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.492
I've got 5,000 units.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.994
I need a place
to keep them for a while.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.529
* *

00:28.596 --> 00:30.564
It's lighter than it looks.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.435
Boom!

00:34.502 --> 00:35.536
Damn.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.738
This makes me want to blast
the hell out of something.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.007
So, go ahead.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.876
* Who laid down
in a concrete bed? *

00:42.943 --> 00:45.979
* Who laid dark thoughts
inside my head? *

00:46.046 --> 00:48.949
* But they don't know *

00:49.016 --> 00:50.751
* No, they don't know... *

00:50.818 --> 00:53.321
Better than sex.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.270
Charlie ask you
to be his best man?

01:09.337 --> 01:11.672
No. I mean, they haven't even
picked a date yet.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.941
What are you going to do
for his bachelor party?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.376
-Well...
-Do the whole clichГ©,

01:15.443 --> 01:16.810
the Las Vegas, stripper thing?

01:16.877 --> 01:20.148
No. I was thinking,
like, golf, cigars.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.082
You know, maybe Laguna
or Torrey Pines.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.985
It's supposed to be his bachelor
party, right, not yours?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.086
Well, fine.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.656
We could take in
a Stephen Hawking seminar.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.558
I swear I had
a beige blouse here.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.293
No, I think you took it home.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.994
What's wrong
with what you have on?

01:34.061 --> 01:35.863
That works for me.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.231
Seriously.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.966
I'm serious.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.968
Six months living out
of a suitcase in Portland,

01:41.034 --> 01:43.804
and now I'm splitting time
between your place and mine?

01:43.871 --> 01:46.340
When did my life
get to be so complicated?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.908
You could move in here.

01:47.975 --> 01:48.776
Yeah.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.478
I'm a little old
to play house, honey.

01:50.544 --> 01:53.714
Well, who's talking
about playing?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.483
W-Why can't it be real?

01:57.985 --> 01:59.387
What's that mean?

02:01.989 --> 02:04.425
(chuckles, cell phone vibrating)

02:04.492 --> 02:07.161
I swear, you made it do that.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.196
DON:
Hey, what's up?

02:08.262 --> 02:10.998
What?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.099
No. All right, yeah, no.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.201
I-I'll call him.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.669
Got a shooting in San Pedro.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.037
That's LAPD.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.239
Why do they want you?

02:18.306 --> 02:20.408
No, it's not me; it's Charlie.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.444
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:30.083 --> 02:32.786
COLBY: This couple was just
fixing breakfast,

02:32.853 --> 02:33.654
minding their own business

02:33.721 --> 02:36.190
when the round came
through the wall.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.825
Went straight through his head,

02:37.891 --> 02:39.960
through that wall
and into the other room.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.496
So, why don't you take a look?

02:43.964 --> 02:46.234
And this is where
it finally stopped.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.435
Now, it's too damaged
to identify.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.802
Let me see that there.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.638
Thanks.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.972
But it was clearly
high-caliber.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.274
What do you think?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.409
Can you help us?

02:55.476 --> 02:58.212
Uh, it's a
reverse-trajectory problem.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.980
Unknown source,

03:00.047 --> 03:01.215
unknown initial velocity.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.950
Countless exterior variables.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.619
It's doable.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.288
Good.

03:30.744 --> 03:34.214
Okay, we need another sweep
300 yards to the east.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
-Agent Sinclair!
-Come with me.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.286
I think we have something.
Inside.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.707
(computer beeping)

04:04.945 --> 04:08.549
We've got a match--
Arvin Lindell.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.051
COLBY: So, his office
is on the other side

04:11.118 --> 04:12.119
of that warehouse right there.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.221
You think it's worth
taking a look, scouting it out?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.489
DAVID:
No. We wait for SWAT.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.991
Put your vest on, please.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.627
COLBY:
A lot of good it's going to do

04:19.693 --> 04:21.629
against the cannon
this guy's got.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.198
That's him. That's Lindell!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.334
(tires screech)

04:26.400 --> 04:28.068
COLBY:
He's getting out!

04:28.135 --> 04:29.337
Gun!

04:36.410 --> 04:38.278
He's firing right
through the car!

04:41.114 --> 04:42.683
What the hell is that thing?

04:54.528 --> 04:56.364
(tires screech)

04:57.297 --> 04:59.567
DAVID:
Come on!

05:04.872 --> 05:06.640
Want to get my hands
on that guy.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.710
Never mind that guy;
I want to get that gun.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.890
Hey.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.758
LIZ: His first victim might
have been unintentional,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.494
but you should've seen
the way he came at us.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.362
I mean, he was standing
in the middle of the street

05:28.429 --> 05:29.530
like he was invincible.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.898
With that much firepower
in his hand,

05:30.964 --> 05:32.800
he pretty much was.
We have LAPD

05:32.866 --> 05:34.868
out there looking for him,
but so far, nothing.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.869
I think I got it.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.104
Check this out.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.240
DAVID:
That looks like it.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.341
It's a BNT-35?

05:41.409 --> 05:43.010
COLBY:
Yeah.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.478
Yeah. They're brand-new,
they're Belgian-made.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.879
Yeah, that's a pretty
good-looking gun.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.015
It ought to be.
Its list price is 12 grand.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.517
There were 5,000
of them manufactured,

05:49.583 --> 05:51.552
and they were all supposed
to go to the Saudis,

05:51.619 --> 05:52.653
according to the EUCs.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.055
-EUCs?
-End User Certificates.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.525
If an arms dealer wants
to move guns internationally,

05:57.591 --> 05:58.792
he's got to have the paperwork.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.528
You can sell rocket launchers
to kids.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.531
As long as you have the EUCs,
it's all legal.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.732
Lindell's a gun show nut.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.667
What's he doing
with Saudi weapons?

06:06.734 --> 06:08.368
That's the thing.
There were no confirmation

06:08.436 --> 06:09.703
of deliveries in the paperwork,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.705
so the Saudis
never got the arms.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.407
Talking about 5,000
of these things missing?

06:13.474 --> 06:15.308
There is an arms dealer
listed in there,

06:15.375 --> 06:17.077
and he's got a local address.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.446
His name is Randall Priest.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.980
Go find him--
maybe he knows something.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.950
MAN:
I never got the guns.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.985
-The Saudi deal didn't happen.
-COLBY: Why not?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.721
Belgian arms manufacturer
couldn't meet the deadline.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.690
Told me they were on schedule,

06:29.757 --> 06:31.324
promised me they
were going to deliver,

06:31.391 --> 06:33.827
but at the last minute,
they couldn't come up with it.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.930
So I substituted
Swiss R-11s instead.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.265
Great weapon.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.399
Not much profit margin.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.470
So, what, you only made a few
million dollars on the deal?

06:42.536 --> 06:43.937
My heart's breaking for you.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.440
The arms business
involves a lot of risk,

06:46.507 --> 06:47.975
financial and personal.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.977
I'm not going to apologize
for the money I make.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.079
What about the devastation
you cause?

06:52.145 --> 06:53.714
Any remorse there?

06:53.781 --> 06:54.848
Do you even know
where your weapons end up

06:54.915 --> 06:56.717
half the time?
Give any thought to who

06:56.784 --> 06:58.886
they're being aimed at,
used on, who dies?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.888
-David... -Do you really think
if I stopped selling weapons,

07:00.954 --> 07:02.490
people would stop
killing each other?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.291
Killing is human nature.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.327
That's why we keep getting
better and better at it.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.896
COLBY:
All right, look, Mr. Priest,

07:08.962 --> 07:11.331
we're interested in the shipment
of BNT-35s.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.600
5,000 of them left Belgium.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.168
We need to know
where they are now.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.137
I told you,
I never got my hands on them.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.772
But I'm guessing you kept
your eyes on them.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.074
They do offer
the higher profit margin.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.209
So who bought them?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.477
Another arms dealer?

07:23.544 --> 07:25.378
I never name names.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.215
People in my line of work
are very touchy about that.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.349
We're wasting our time.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.619
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.020
But I need a little help
in return.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.155
(chuckles softly)
Of course.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.289
What kind of help?

07:36.356 --> 07:37.457
There's a shipment--

07:37.525 --> 07:39.627
infrared goggles,
night vision scopes.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.761
They've been tied up in customs

07:40.828 --> 07:42.229
in New Jersey for almost a year.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.566
No way.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.571
We'll make a few calls.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.046
AMITA:
No, September's tough.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.948
Classes begin,
and then the last two weekends

08:01.014 --> 08:02.816
are the combinatorics
conference in Dallas.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.617
Yeah.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.852
Okay, so September's out.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.820
Unless you want to get married
at the conference.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.856
Everyone could toast us
with the Gale Shapley algorithm.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.059
Used in combinatorics

08:12.125 --> 08:13.594
to solve the stable
marriage problem.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.928
I get it.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.697
-It's not really helping.
-Okay.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.299
-How about August 14?
-(door opens)

08:19.366 --> 08:22.035
Nope. The Arboretum
isn't available August 14.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.104
Unless you don't want
to get married in the Arboretum.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.906
Now you're changing your mind
about the Arboretum?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.908
It took you two months
to settle on that.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.543
(stammering):
Yeah. Uh, look, he's right.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.644
We're not moving backwards.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.145
We're just going to find
a new date.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.047
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-That's all.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.148
Hey.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.149
Hi.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.417
The last week of July.

08:37.484 --> 08:40.554
Wait, is that the wedding you're
talking about? Not the 26th.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.155
I have to be in Quantico.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.091
-Sorry.
-(Alan sighs)

08:44.157 --> 08:46.927
You know, people say that
being married is the challenge.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.295
I say the challenge
is getting married.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.430
Once you get through that,
the rest is easy.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.699
Guys, let me
simplify things for you.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.100
How about
a justice of the peace, huh?

08:53.166 --> 08:56.069
This is all very interesting,
but it's not really

08:56.136 --> 08:57.304
helping Charlie and me.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.007
No, no. No, no, no.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.709
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.244
Any luck with, uh,
recovering that gun?

09:04.311 --> 09:06.313
No. You know,
it's not one gun anymore.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.648
It's 5,000 of the things.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.849
Anything I can do?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.317
Well, we're working
on a deal to get info,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.586
so as soon as we do,
I'll let you know, all right?

09:12.653 --> 09:13.921
-All right.
-ALAN: Wait, wait, wait.

09:13.987 --> 09:14.855
June 18.

09:14.922 --> 09:15.989
No, I-I really don't want

09:16.056 --> 09:18.225
to be a June bride,
if I can help it.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.595
Justice of the peace.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.496
PRIEST:
Are we looking at

09:23.563 --> 09:25.999
some mutual aid here,
or am I just wasting my time?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.769
The U.S. Attorney's Office
will intercede on your behalf,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.604
see about freeing
your containers.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.172
But you get nothing in writing.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.174
This is strictly
a good faith effort.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.310
That's about as close
to a contract as I ever get.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.380
Looks like we got a deal.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.049
Surprised you don't want
something written in blood.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.052
What about those guns
we're looking for?

09:45.118 --> 09:47.020
Manufacturer confirms
that they left Belgium,

09:47.087 --> 09:48.789
but they won't tell us
who bought them

09:48.856 --> 09:50.257
or where they're headed.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.626
Or how one ended up here in L.A.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.396
You've got probably
half a dozen arms shipments

09:56.463 --> 09:57.865
sitting in this port right now.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.467
They sail in from
whatever corner of the world.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.737
They're unloaded, containers
are reshuffled, relabeled maybe.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.706
And then they sit
until there's a ship ready

10:05.773 --> 10:07.641
to take them
to their next destination.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.977
Why risk coming
through an American port?

10:10.043 --> 10:11.812
Why not just ship direct?

10:11.879 --> 10:14.481
You avoid all the security
that's in place here.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.049
It's because of the security.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.685
Ships that go through the U.S.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.519
enjoy better protection
worldwide.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.954
That's just a fact.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.956
And when you're talking $20
or $30 million in arms...

10:23.023 --> 10:25.058
You move them
the safest way possible.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.694
That means one of three ports:

10:26.760 --> 10:30.297
Newark, Miami or L.A., baby.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.965
Okay.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.400
Well, that gets the guns here.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.970
Doesn't explain how one ends up
in Arvin Lindell's hands.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.405
He probably took it as payment.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.107
Lindell used to be a dockworker.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.375
He parlayed it
into a nice side business.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.744
If you have containers in port,

10:43.811 --> 10:45.512
you need someone
to look after them,

10:45.578 --> 10:46.546
shuffle them around,

10:46.613 --> 10:47.848
make sure they avoid inspection

10:47.915 --> 10:49.416
until they're on the next boat.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.385
Arvin Lindell's that guy.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.056
LIZ:
I mean, there's got to be

10:56.123 --> 10:58.091
200,000 shipping containers
in this port.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.426
We're looking for two?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.228
Classic needle in a haystack.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.097
Only worse-- our haystack keeps
shifting as goods come and go.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.366
Actually...

11:06.433 --> 11:08.702
actually, the shifting
may help us, the movement.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.203
Containers move around the port

11:10.270 --> 11:12.505
in very specific
predetermined paths.

11:12.572 --> 11:15.075
It's the only way that shipping
companies can keep track

11:15.142 --> 11:17.010
of so many containers at once
and get them

11:17.077 --> 11:18.278
-to their destinations.
-Well, the problem

11:18.345 --> 11:20.714
with our guy is,
there are security inspections

11:20.781 --> 11:21.749
along the way.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.083
He has to avoid them.

11:23.150 --> 11:27.454
Right. So we're looking
for two containers...

11:27.520 --> 11:30.724
moving outside the normal flow,

11:30.791 --> 11:33.626
in terms of space and time.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.995
It's like a newsstand.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.864
Like shipping containers,

11:36.930 --> 11:39.099
periodicals come and go
on different schedules--

11:39.166 --> 11:41.168
some daily, some weekly,
others monthly.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.737
Now, let's say
there's a math journal

11:43.804 --> 11:45.305
that I really,
really want to buy,

11:45.372 --> 11:47.607
but I don't have enough money;
I have to save up.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.143
Considering how incredibly
popular math journals are,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.445
I'm worried someone else
is going to buy it.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.514
So I decide to hide it

11:54.581 --> 11:57.751
by stuffing it, mmm,
behind a surfing magazine.

11:57.818 --> 12:01.154
But later, when I come back,
the surfing magazine has sold,

12:01.221 --> 12:03.523
so I decide to hide
the math journal again,

12:03.590 --> 12:05.025
this time in the arts section.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.260
I continue to move and hide
the math journal

12:07.327 --> 12:10.630
until I save up
enough money to buy it.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.132
And so the journal
ultimately goes

12:12.199 --> 12:14.835
from point "A" to point "B,"
from delivery to purchase,

12:14.902 --> 12:17.905
but its movements
are far outside the normal flow.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.875
An incredibly popular
and very expensive math journal?

12:21.942 --> 12:22.943
All right.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.277
You know what I mean.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.646
So how do we find
our two containers?

12:26.713 --> 12:28.916
4-D mapping.
We graph the movements

12:28.982 --> 12:31.051
-in three dimensions...
-OTTO: Over a fourth dimension:

12:31.118 --> 12:33.320
time!
(chuckles)

12:33.386 --> 12:35.823
Uh, Liz,
this is Professor Bahnhoff.

12:35.889 --> 12:36.957
Otto, or...

12:37.024 --> 12:38.758
-Otto-Bahn.
-Nice to meet you.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.928
So, I thought I smelled pizza.
Is there pizza? I'm starving.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.896
Oh, whoa.
What are you working on?

12:42.963 --> 12:45.698
Uh, we're trying to locate
a missing shipment of weapons.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.534
Ah, yes, yes.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.574
Mmm, no, no, no.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.542
No good.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.078
Uh, the muzzle velocity
and the rate of fire

12:58.145 --> 13:00.180
are entirely inconsistent
with the construction.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.582
This gun won't work.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.517
It works fine. Trust me.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.653
Oh. Maybe I'm wrong.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.555
Uh, I need food.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.627
Any word on Arvin Lindell?

13:14.694 --> 13:15.795
Oh, hey.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.598
Uh, no. I mean, you know,
we got everybody out looking.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.732
That's all we can do.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.968
Well, customs is cooperating.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.269
They're clearing the way

13:22.335 --> 13:23.971
to have Priest's
New Jersey shipment released.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.372
-All right, that's good.
-Hold on.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.007
DAVID:
Are we seriously going to help

13:27.074 --> 13:28.408
-this death merchant out?
-Well, David,

13:28.475 --> 13:31.111
I don't like the idea, either,
but we kind of need the guy.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.513
-Can I talk to you for one sec?
-ROBIN: Sure.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.484
This is nuts.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.386
Am I the only one who
really has a problem with it?

13:39.452 --> 13:40.787
What's going on with you, man?
You've been

13:40.854 --> 13:42.122
going off on this guy
from the start.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.591
It's not this guy--
I mean, it's what he does.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.393
He sells arms indiscriminately

13:46.459 --> 13:48.428
to dictators, warlords
and terror groups.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.197
This... this guy
doesn't give a crap

13:50.263 --> 13:52.399
about who his weapons
are used on.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.536
And now we're in bed with him.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.006
I know that Tuesdays
are normally your place,

13:59.072 --> 14:00.874
but my deposition
tomorrow got pushed up,

14:00.941 --> 14:02.342
so can we please do my...?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.411
Listen. Come here.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.980
I've been thinking
about what you said,

14:07.047 --> 14:09.249
you know, about everything
being so complicated.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.451
I'm sorry. I was frustrated.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.785
No, you're right.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.288
It's ridiculous
we pay two rents.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.090
I think we should
get married.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.860
Where did that come from?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.829
-What do you mean?
-Well, this morning,

14:22.896 --> 14:25.498
you throw it off as a joke,
and now you're serious?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.200
Uh...

14:27.267 --> 14:30.170
I... I mean,
it makes sense, doesn't it?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.605
I-I would've thought
you'd be happy.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.042
Well, not when you make it sound
like you're doing me a favor.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.044
I'm not. I'm...

14:37.110 --> 14:38.979
Well, are you going to say no?

14:41.148 --> 14:43.583
I'm sorry. I... I think I am.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.188
Hey, Liz called--
found Arvin Lindell.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.657
All right.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.970
COLBY:
So, how'd the cops find him?

15:03.036 --> 15:04.104
They didn't.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.973
A film crew did scouting
for locations.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.174
From all the shells,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.642
he must've gone through
a couple hundred rounds.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.211
And nobody heard the shooting?

15:11.278 --> 15:12.412
That's what I said.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.880
I guess,
when the cranes are running,

15:13.947 --> 15:17.985
you could set off a bomb around
here and nobody'd hear it.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.619
The gun exploded?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.488
LIZ: Piece of it caught him
in the throat.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.824
Probably bled out
just like that.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.359
What's the saying?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.461
"Guns don't kill people.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.197
Guns do."

15:39.339 --> 15:40.940
LIZ:
Thanks for coming down, Otto.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.242
OTTO:
Oh, not a problem.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.511
I have a favorite Ethiopian
restaurant near here,

15:44.577 --> 15:45.612
so any excuse.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.914
You met Agent Sinclair
and Agent Granger before.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.016
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

15:49.082 --> 15:50.517
I was right!

15:50.583 --> 15:52.952
-Which is why you're here.
-Otto, how did you know

15:53.020 --> 15:54.254
something was wrong
with the gun?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.390
Uh, PV equals nRT--
the ideal gas law.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.093
Uh, some Fourier series
applied to heat dispersion,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.362
throw in a stress-strain curve,
and there you are.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.631
Liz said you only glanced
at the weapon's spec sheet.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.634
Oh, well, uh, to be fair,
it was the spec sheet

16:07.700 --> 16:09.669
combined with Charlie's
reverse-trajectory work.

16:09.736 --> 16:13.240
Uh, see, Professor Eppes's data
suggested a muzzle velocity

16:13.306 --> 16:14.841
of over 900 meters per second,

16:14.907 --> 16:16.243
and combine that
with a firing rate

16:16.309 --> 16:18.678
of 1,100 rounds per minute,
you're generating heat

16:18.745 --> 16:19.846
and pressure levels beyond

16:19.912 --> 16:20.747
the tensile strength tolerance

16:20.813 --> 16:22.249
-of the delivery chamber.
-COLBY: Okay.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.416
When Charlie does this,
he usually

16:23.483 --> 16:26.453
dumbs it down
just a little bit for us.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.588
Oh. Um...

16:28.655 --> 16:30.657
Well, the barrel wall
is too thin.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.725
My guess is that
the manufacturer was trying

16:32.792 --> 16:33.793
to keep the gun lightweight.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.328
COLBY: How does the manufacturer
mess up this badly?

16:35.395 --> 16:37.364
I mean, they've been making guns
for 40 years.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.665
Their sniper rifles
are considered

16:38.731 --> 16:41.101
-some of the best in the world.
-Well, thin-walled barrel--

16:41.168 --> 16:42.369
it's a good design
for a sniper rifle.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.671
But not a good design
for an automatic weapon?

16:44.737 --> 16:47.374
Yes, yes. Uh, you could fire
a 50-round magazine,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.309
maybe two, building up
heat and pressure.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.510
Next magazine, boom,

16:50.577 --> 16:52.545
-you get this.
-DAVID: So it's not just

16:52.612 --> 16:54.747
this gun;
it's the whole shipment.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.795
What are you doing?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.297
Hey. Uh...

17:10.363 --> 17:12.832
just trying to find
these guns for Don.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.201
I think I'm getting close.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.736
I don't want
to interrupt your flow.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.106
I just wanted to apologize.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.742
What do you have
to apologize for?

17:22.809 --> 17:25.178
I've been a little intense
about this whole...

17:25.245 --> 17:26.779
"picking a date" thing,
you know.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.048
Who knew it would be this hard?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.451
Listen to me.
Don't worry about it.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.654
We're gonna find a date
that works for us

17:34.721 --> 17:36.323
and for our venue

17:36.389 --> 17:38.658
and for your kooky relatives
in India.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.892
(laughs)

17:39.959 --> 17:41.128
-Okay?
-Yeah.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.763
I guess I should be glad that
we're not getting married there.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.566
You know, I had a cousin
who had to postpone her wedding

17:46.633 --> 17:50.237
for four months, because they
couldn't schedule the elephant.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.472
Your... cousin had an elephant
at her wedding?

17:52.539 --> 17:54.341
Yeah. In a traditional
Hindu wedding,

17:54.407 --> 17:55.875
you pretty much
have to have one.

17:55.942 --> 17:56.909
That's how the groom arrives.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.178
Wait a minute.
(laughs)

17:58.245 --> 18:00.313
The groom rides in
on an elephant?

18:00.380 --> 18:01.714
-Yes. (giggles)
-Is that what you're telling me?

18:01.781 --> 18:04.451
How come no one told me this
when we decided to get married?

18:04.517 --> 18:07.220
You hear this? If we were
getting married in India,

18:07.287 --> 18:08.788
I'd be riding in on an elephant.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.223
Go east, young man.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.491
AMITA:
And you would wear

18:11.558 --> 18:13.460
a long sherwani jacket
and a turban on your head.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.462
Actually, my favorite part

18:15.528 --> 18:16.896
of the ceremony
is that the bride

18:16.963 --> 18:19.666
and the groom have
their hands bound together.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.235
It's incredibly romantic
and beautiful.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.504
CHARLIE:
You still feel good about your

18:24.571 --> 18:26.606
-justice of the peace idea?
-Don't ask me about this stuff.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.674
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.176
How are you doing
on those guns?

18:29.242 --> 18:30.743
Turns out they're way more
dangerous than we thought,

18:30.810 --> 18:32.545
and if they slip away,
it's not going to be pretty.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.548
I haven't narrowed it down
to the exact container yet.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.484
I'll give you the short list.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.592
(garbled radio transmission)

19:13.820 --> 19:15.788
-LIZ: Nothing. -I mean, you got
to be kidding me.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.525
All 22 containers Charlie
pointed out to us came up empty.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.826
So what the hell happened?

19:19.892 --> 19:21.761
Don't ask me. I mean,
when Charlie started talking

19:21.828 --> 19:23.830
about 4-D mapping, I just did
the smile-and-nod thing.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.332
DAVID: Yeah, we were relying
on information

19:25.398 --> 19:26.566
from the Port Authority, so, uh,

19:26.633 --> 19:28.235
maybe the problem's coming
from there.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.571
COLBY: Thought we'd have
another go at Priest.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.006
Figure he owes us, now that
customs released his stuff.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.408
Give me five minutes with him.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.277
All right, go for it.
You know what, take Colby.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.546
Maybe, like, a little
bad cop thing, you know?

19:39.612 --> 19:40.847
Just don't push too hard.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.916
I'm going to be the one
to push too hard?

19:49.155 --> 19:52.058
-You didn't come over
last night. -Yeah, well...

19:52.124 --> 19:54.026
Don, we need to talk.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.228
Come over tonight.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.229
What's to talk about?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.664
Don't be an ass.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.666
(groans)

20:04.937 --> 20:07.340
Did you know
the guns were faulty?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.342
Well, this one was, anyway.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.810
All of them.

20:10.877 --> 20:11.844
It's a design flaw.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.813
The whole shipment is bad.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.214
PRIEST:
That explains why the Belgians

20:15.282 --> 20:16.383
backed out of my Saudi deal.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.850
They must have realized
the guns were junk.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.852
-Junk that somebody is selling.
-It's a business.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.421
If someone sees these guns
as a chance

20:21.488 --> 20:22.922
to make a buck, they'll take it.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.223
But you would never do that.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.359
No, I wouldn't.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.627
I'm in it for the long haul.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.729
If I ever made a sale like this,

20:29.796 --> 20:31.764
and there was a massive
battlefield failure,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.900
I'd never make
another sale again.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.371
Hey, look,
I don't have the guns...

20:38.438 --> 20:39.739
But you know who does.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.874
COLBY:
Look, you can understand

20:41.941 --> 20:44.911
why we need to find them,
assuming they haven't left L.A.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.747
They haven't. I can tell you
that much, all right?

20:47.814 --> 20:48.781
Hey, look,
we had a deal with you.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.351
Okay? And we have
kept up our side.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.385
And I've kept up my end.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.786
Reasonable cooperation.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.888
Hey, I don't mind
schooling you guys

20:55.955 --> 20:57.290
in Arms Dealing 101,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.791
but I told you
from the beginning,

20:58.858 --> 21:00.293
-I'm not a snitch.
-DAVID: Yeah, a snitch

21:00.360 --> 21:02.662
is way up the food chain
from where you are.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.405
Do you mind if I hide
out here with you?

21:12.472 --> 21:13.606
Because Wedding Central in there

21:13.673 --> 21:15.375
has just been dealt
another blow.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.377
Seems there's
a physics conference

21:17.444 --> 21:19.379
or something
that's a conflict for Larry.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.247
Assuming anyone can find Larry.

21:21.314 --> 21:22.815
You know, I was right
when I said

21:22.882 --> 21:24.717
that-that getting married
is the hard part.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.687
Can we just talk about something
else for a change, please?

21:27.754 --> 21:28.821
You can't be tired
of it already.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.956
I mean,
it's just getting started.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.291
(chuckles) You know,
after they set the date,

21:32.359 --> 21:34.694
they got the invitations
and then the...

21:34.761 --> 21:37.764
guest lists, and then there's
always a drama about who sits...

21:37.830 --> 21:39.632
Enough!

21:40.633 --> 21:42.769
(quietly):
All right.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.378
I kind of asked Robin
to marry me.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.447
She said no.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.516
-Why?
-I don't know.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.585
She must have said something.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.387
We were supposed
to talk about it tonight,

22:00.453 --> 22:01.754
not that I really want to.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.056
Oh, come on, come on.
You have to.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.926
Dad, can we just play, please?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.998
-(sirens wailing)
-(clamoring voices)

22:12.064 --> 22:14.000
(helicopter hovering)

22:19.406 --> 22:21.173
The witnesses say
it was a drive-by.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.743
Two shooters, both with
big-time automatic weapons.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.578
We're sure they're our BNTs?

22:25.645 --> 22:27.079
The shell casings match.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.347
We got seven casualties.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.282
Only three were in
the targeted house.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.284
The others, all collateral.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.953
DAVID: Found four more victims
on the other block.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.855
The rounds went
right through this house,

22:35.922 --> 22:37.490
slicing through
the whole damn neighborhood.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.925
-You guys, with me. Come on.
-All right.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.528
-All right, make a hole.
Make a hole. -I got the back.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.030
Colby, we know these guns
are useless

22:44.096 --> 22:46.499
for the battlefield,
but think about it--

22:46.566 --> 22:47.900
they're perfectly suited
for street crime.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.436
You fire short bursts
here and there.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.237
Right, you never
heat them up enough

22:51.303 --> 22:52.572
for the barrels to fracture.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.841
What if they're not
being shipped overseas?

22:54.907 --> 22:57.710
What if this is their final
destination-- these streets?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.858
(indistinct voices)

23:13.926 --> 23:16.463
(siren wailing)

23:16.529 --> 23:18.931
You all right?

23:18.998 --> 23:22.902
11 lives are devastated,
just like that.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.638
Well, the only upside--
if there is one--

23:25.705 --> 23:27.774
cops said normally
nobody comes forward,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.109
but tonight, we got neighbors
lining up as witnesses.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.745
Yeah, I mean, this really scared
the crap out of them.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.881
To be honest,
it scares me, too.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.082
LIZ:
Well, no license plate,

23:36.148 --> 23:37.950
but we got a definite
make and model.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.686
It's a dark blue Monte Carlo,

23:39.752 --> 23:41.153
and more than one witness said

23:41.220 --> 23:43.089
the driver might have been hit
by return fire.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.957
DAVID: All right, so we, uh,
put a bulletin

23:45.024 --> 23:47.426
out on the car,
we keep watch on the hospitals.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.861
It's the same guns?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.431
I should have found them.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.735
You know, it's not like
4-D mapping is fringe science.

23:55.802 --> 23:56.969
My math should have worked.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.505
Not if you had the wrong data,
Charlie.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.572
That's an easy excuse.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.107
LIZ:
It's a valid one, Charlie.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.242
We told you the guns
were waiting to ship overseas.

24:03.309 --> 24:04.143
You think they're not?

24:04.210 --> 24:05.578
You-you think
they're staying here?

24:05.645 --> 24:06.846
I mean, it would explain this.

24:06.913 --> 24:10.983
Charlie, Otto is... is he okay?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.586
CHARLIE: Hey, hey, Otto,
are you all right, man?

24:13.653 --> 24:16.823
I just... I-I need to get
to a chalkboard.

24:25.397 --> 24:26.666
Is he okay?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.801
Is there anybody
we should call or anything?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.970
I think he just needs
to work it through.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.605
Work what through?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.941
Theory just collided
with reality.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.243
It's not about equations
anymore.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.648
Otto.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.251
Are you okay?

24:45.317 --> 24:46.819
-Otto?
-CHARLIE: Otto-Bahn.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.254
What?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.822
He likes to be called Otto-Bahn.

24:51.524 --> 24:52.925
Otto-Bahn?

24:56.128 --> 24:58.397
We just don't realize
the absolute frailty

24:58.464 --> 24:59.632
of the human body.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.167
AMITA:
What is all this?

25:01.233 --> 25:02.769
Uh, it's devastation.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.071
Uh, the damage caused
by two guns

25:05.137 --> 25:07.206
in a single shooting event
extrapolated out

25:07.273 --> 25:09.909
to include all 4,999
of the missing guns.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.711
And not just first-person
physical injury,

25:11.778 --> 25:14.246
but secondary and tertiary
emotional injury, as well.

25:14.313 --> 25:18.184
The potential for destruction
is... it-it's staggering.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.252
I mean, tens of thousands
of lives affected.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.054
-Only in a worst-case scenario.
-But it's an entirely

25:22.121 --> 25:23.189
plausible scenario,
if the guns end up

25:23.255 --> 25:25.124
-on the streets.
-It's not going to happen.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.793
-You can't know that.
-Listen to me.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.127
My earlier hunt came up empty

25:28.194 --> 25:32.098
because we thought the guns
were being shipped overseas.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
Now we know better.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.136
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

25:37.203 --> 25:39.238
You had a long night.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.009
I met a girl.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.511
Two, actually.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.747
You know how that goes.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.650
Or maybe you don't.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.053
Need to ask you something.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.822
Come on in.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.724
How much money
does one man need?

25:57.790 --> 25:59.659
What kind of question is that?

25:59.726 --> 26:00.827
I've been standing
out there all night

26:00.893 --> 26:02.629
trying to figure it out.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.130
All over the world,
people are killed

26:04.196 --> 26:06.498
and maimed by your weapons
so you can get richer.

26:06.565 --> 26:10.136
But you already have more money
than you could ever spend,

26:10.202 --> 26:14.340
and so I'm wondering--
how much do you need?

26:14.406 --> 26:17.143
When is it enough?

26:17.209 --> 26:18.110
I don't know, man.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.012
It's just not that
black-and-white anymore.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.614
It's kind of a muddy gray.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.252
I'm going to need
to find those guns.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.586
And I'm gonna need
to go to bed.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.756
Are we really gonna have
this conversation again?

26:29.822 --> 26:32.792
No. No, you're right. We're not.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.896
-(cuffs clicking) -Oh, what,
are you arresting me?

26:36.963 --> 26:39.666
This is something else.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.601
(sighs)

27:15.668 --> 27:18.037
Last night,
a 58-year-old grandmother

27:18.104 --> 27:19.338
was in her kitchen
making dinner.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.774
Four high-velocity rounds
came through a wall,

27:21.841 --> 27:24.043
one hit her in the head--
killed her instantly.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.012
You see that house right there?

27:26.078 --> 27:28.014
Nine-year-old girl
was inside doing her homework

27:28.080 --> 27:31.017
when a stray hit her
in the wrist.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.819
Probably going to lose her hand.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.620
They're not my guns, man.

27:34.687 --> 27:35.955
No, not this time.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.024
But how is this street
any different

27:38.090 --> 27:39.926
from any of the other places
in the world

27:39.992 --> 27:41.160
where you peddle your weapons?

27:41.227 --> 27:42.962
Do you want to talk
to these people,

27:43.029 --> 27:44.931
see if their grief
is any different

27:44.997 --> 27:46.565
than the grief that you cause?

27:46.632 --> 27:48.935
You could've stopped it.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.937
It wouldn't have happened
if you'd told us

27:51.003 --> 27:53.439
who had the guns when we asked.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.941
You know what your problem is,
Sinclair?

27:55.007 --> 27:57.276
You let this get personal.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.012
You're right.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.981
I got an image in my mind

28:02.048 --> 28:04.583
that I can't get rid of,
I can't shake.

28:04.650 --> 28:05.718
It's always there.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.821
It goes back
to my first posting in Israel.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.923
There was a family,
and I had gotten to them

28:10.990 --> 28:13.059
right after their house
was... was hit by a rocket.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.928
They were still sitting
around their dinner table,

28:15.995 --> 28:18.230
covered in blood.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.933
They were dying.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.569
They didn't even know
what happened to them.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.104
What are the chances

28:25.171 --> 28:29.175
that rocket
is something that you supplied?

28:32.845 --> 28:34.280
Are we done here?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.182
Yeah.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.017
Done.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.792
(engine starting)

28:47.659 --> 28:49.929
(door handle clacks)

29:02.374 --> 29:03.642
Hey.

29:03.709 --> 29:06.612
Hey. I hear you guys
had a rough night last night.

29:06.678 --> 29:07.880
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.315
I'm sorry.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.887
Look, I know this isn't
any of my business,

29:14.954 --> 29:17.790
but I noticed things
were kind of strained

29:17.857 --> 29:19.191
between you and Don yesterday.

29:19.258 --> 29:22.995
Don't take this the wrong way,
but it feels a little weird

29:23.062 --> 29:25.564
to discuss Don
with one of his ex-girlfriends.

29:25.631 --> 29:28.100
That would imply
I actually was his girlfriend.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.870
I was never more than a rebound

29:30.937 --> 29:33.072
after you guys broke up
the first time.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.175
I don't know what I'm supposed
to say to that.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.344
Nothing. I just...
I thought you should know

29:38.410 --> 29:40.980
that he was always...

29:41.047 --> 29:42.815
stuck on you.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.855
Thanks.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.794
Liz.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.496
Just got a call
from a hospital in Whittier.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.198
They have a 20-year-old male
that checked in

29:59.265 --> 30:01.100
to the ER this morning
with a gunshot wound

30:01.167 --> 30:02.801
-he picked up last night.
-You run him?

30:02.869 --> 30:04.070
Uh-huh.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.804
Record says gang member
all over it.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.440
He's been arrested three times
with his younger brother.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.676
You want to guess what kind of
car his younger brother owns?

30:10.742 --> 30:13.012
A dark blue Monte Carlo?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.648
LIZ:
Tell us about your arm, Eddie.

30:16.715 --> 30:17.917
(scoffs)

30:17.984 --> 30:20.386
I was cleaning my gun.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.554
It went off.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.090
Okay, we're going to skip
right over

30:24.156 --> 30:26.292
the question of what a parolee
would be doing

30:26.358 --> 30:28.794
with a gun, 'cause we know
that's not what happened.

30:28.861 --> 30:30.462
DON: What, this
is his little brother?

30:30.529 --> 30:31.530
LIZ:
Yeah.

30:31.597 --> 30:32.698
What a cute kid, huh?

30:32.764 --> 30:34.400
You proud of him?

30:34.466 --> 30:36.235
LIZ: You're setting
a shining example.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.237
What, you two have been arrested
four times together?

30:38.304 --> 30:39.838
Hey, Victor's a good kid.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.373
He looks up to you, doesn't he?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.009
He obviously wants
to be like you.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.676
I don't know if he's going
to get a chance.

30:44.743 --> 30:46.112
What you talking about?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.346
We got LAPD
about to hit your house.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.580
You think they're gonna take
any chances

30:48.647 --> 30:49.381
with those guns you bought?

30:49.448 --> 30:51.783
LIZ:
They're ready for war.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.254
40 cops, automatic weapons,
armored vehicles, stun grenades.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.456
DON: So the question is,
how smart is he?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.291
You think he's smart enough
to surrender?

30:59.358 --> 31:00.792
Or is he going to try
and fight it out

31:00.859 --> 31:02.661
'cause he thinks that's what
you would want him to do?

31:02.728 --> 31:04.931
I'm telling you right now--
he fights, he's dead.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.834
What you want from me?

31:08.901 --> 31:11.270
Tell us who sold you the guns.

31:11.337 --> 31:15.174
You do that, we let you
make a call to Victor,

31:15.241 --> 31:16.642
tell him to surrender
peacefully.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.111
Nobody dies today.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.983
Look, I don't know
the guy's name.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.184
We just called him "Whitey."

31:25.251 --> 31:27.319
-(scoffs)
-No, man, it's not like that.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.587
It's 'cause of his eye.

31:28.654 --> 31:32.458
He's got one
that's all... milky.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.107
What the hell is this?

31:48.174 --> 31:50.076
-It's a good offer.
-$1,500 a weapon?

31:50.142 --> 31:51.677
I paid $2,000, add in the cost

31:51.743 --> 31:54.246
of shipping them over,
why would I want to take a loss?

31:54.313 --> 31:56.282
The guns are junk, Moses.

31:56.348 --> 31:57.716
What do you expect me to do?

31:57.783 --> 31:59.751
I didn't expect
you'd try to screw me.

31:59.818 --> 32:00.919
Maybe I should've.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.422
It's $7.5 million.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.691
Make up the difference
on your next deal.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.526
Not interested.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.095
The FBI is all over
these guns, Moses.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.362
It's just a matter of days

32:10.429 --> 32:12.064
before they trace them to you.
That happens,

32:12.131 --> 32:15.234
they seize the whole shipment,
you're out the whole amount.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.338
At least this way,
you get something.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.442
I want it in cash... tonight.

32:25.511 --> 32:26.712
(gunshot)

32:31.050 --> 32:32.918
Hey, I think we have it.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.286
Yes, yes, yes, uh, we have it.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.388
Uh, we redid the 4-D graphing
of container movement

32:36.455 --> 32:37.656
in the port; only this time,

32:37.723 --> 32:39.358
instead of looking
at containers moving atypically

32:39.425 --> 32:40.459
in areas proximal to shipping,

32:40.526 --> 32:42.361
we focused on areas proximal
to port egress.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.695
Yes, yes, ye...

32:43.762 --> 32:44.963
Yes, we recalculated

32:45.031 --> 32:46.132
using the new data,

32:46.198 --> 32:48.100
assuming the guns
aren't shipping out.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.235
And so, you found them?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.503
Yes, they should be
in a storage yard

32:51.570 --> 32:54.673
on the east end of the port
near warehouse 32.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.742
32.
(chuckles)

33:28.407 --> 33:30.576
I'm in the arms business
20 years, Moses.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.811
You really think
I'm still impressed by guns?

33:32.878 --> 33:34.046
Where's the money?

33:34.113 --> 33:36.182
It's here. Where are the BNTs?

33:36.248 --> 33:37.949
I need to see the money first.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.251
(chuckles)

33:39.318 --> 33:40.719
-Is this how you handle all your
customers? -(car unlocks)

33:40.786 --> 33:43.455
No wonder you're still
a bottom-feeder.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.657
Which is why I brought
my own guys.

33:49.395 --> 33:52.064
There's the cash.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.667
-Where are the weapons?
-(car locks)

33:55.734 --> 33:58.204
This way.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.677
(goggles whirring)

34:17.756 --> 34:19.691
Okay, so which ones?

34:22.728 --> 34:25.131
Take your pick.
Doesn't really matter.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.799
BNTs are gone.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.102
Already got another buyer.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.271
Want to throw me the keys
to your car?

34:33.172 --> 34:35.274
Now, why would I do that?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.210
Oh, you're right.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.312
I could always just
take it off your body.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.249
LIZ:
Take the shot.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.316
It's a setup!

34:55.594 --> 34:57.163
Don't move.
Up against the wall.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.297
Down, down!

34:58.364 --> 35:00.532
(indistinct radio transmission)

35:10.108 --> 35:12.144
LIZ:
Five dead and six injured.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.413
Add to that your buddy,
Arvin Lindell,

35:14.480 --> 35:16.515
you're on the hook
for six bodies.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.284
You know same as I do
those aren't mine.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.551
Oh, yes, they are.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.420
And as supplier
of an illegal assault weapon,

35:21.487 --> 35:23.655
you can be charged
as an accessory

35:23.722 --> 35:26.992
in any crimes
that your guns commit.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.595
4,997 more guns out there.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.564
That's like a prison-time
investment plan.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.833
And the accessory charges
are just going to keep piling up

35:34.900 --> 35:36.935
every single time
one of those guns are used.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.904
Conversation's over.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.906
I want my lawyer.

35:47.513 --> 35:50.882
Just, uh, give us
a couple minutes, okay?

35:57.389 --> 35:59.090
You son of a bitch.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.326
You set me up.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.694
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.297
And if I hadn't,
where would I be right now?

36:05.364 --> 36:07.799
You were going to shoot me,

36:07.866 --> 36:08.967
steal my money.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.101
You know what's going to happen

36:10.168 --> 36:11.203
when word gets out
you're a snitch?

36:11.270 --> 36:12.204
You're done.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.439
It's over for you.

36:13.505 --> 36:14.640
I thought you were done talking.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.712
I've got a name for you, Moses.

36:20.779 --> 36:21.947
General Mombayzi.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.517
Remember him?

36:25.584 --> 36:27.118
Somebody ripped the general off

36:27.185 --> 36:29.521
for $36 million last year.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.123
And as long as I'm a snitch,

36:32.190 --> 36:33.859
maybe I'll snitch to him.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.628
-Can't prove it was me.
-You think the general

36:36.695 --> 36:38.664
is gonna give a damn
about proof?

36:43.435 --> 36:45.371
Tell them where the guns are.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.113
All right, man, hurry up!

36:55.180 --> 36:58.350
We got two more stops tonight.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.818
-All right, get it out of here.
-(tires screeching)

36:59.885 --> 37:01.753
MAN: This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.122
-Throw down your weapons.
-LIZ: Freeze! FBI!

37:04.189 --> 37:05.324
Don't you move.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.995
Put your hands behind your head
and turn around slowly.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.397
(helicopter blades whirring)

37:11.463 --> 37:13.499
(handcuffs clicking)

37:19.305 --> 37:21.373
COLBY:
Hey.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.941
You could look a little happier,
you know.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.943
-We get the guns?
-With what was on the truck,

37:25.010 --> 37:28.580
plus what the Leyva brothers
had, they're all accounted for.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.550
You know, another day or two,

37:31.617 --> 37:33.151
things could've gotten
so much worse.

37:33.218 --> 37:34.286
You think about it,

37:34.353 --> 37:36.221
this is just one shipment
of guns

37:36.288 --> 37:37.589
out of how many in the world?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.325
I'm not even going there.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.792
You shouldn't either, man.

37:40.859 --> 37:44.396
Just mark this in the "win"
column and call it a day.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.899
I'm gonna pack it up
and go home.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.701
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.043
I guess gratitude is more
than I should expect, huh?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.545
Gratitude for what?

37:59.611 --> 38:02.113
I mean, the way I see it,
you come out on top.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.449
With Moses out of the way,

38:03.515 --> 38:05.317
you have less competition,
right?

38:08.920 --> 38:10.689
That thing you said
in the street,

38:10.756 --> 38:13.191
about wondering if the rocket
that killed that family

38:13.258 --> 38:14.793
was something that I sold.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.596
I wonder that, too.

38:17.663 --> 38:21.433
It's not too late for you
to change your line of work.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.868
You know?

38:24.135 --> 38:26.938
You think one good deed
buys me redemption?

38:27.005 --> 38:28.006
Come on.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.342
I think you helped us out
for a reason.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.877
And it wasn't for your shipment

38:31.943 --> 38:35.381
of night vision goggles
stuck in Newark.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.084
How much money
does one guy need?

38:39.150 --> 38:41.319
-Right?
-Yeah.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.589
Take care, Agent Sinclair.

38:53.799 --> 38:58.404
* It's been five years,
we've had good and bad *

39:00.539 --> 39:02.741
* The ivy grows thick *

39:02.808 --> 39:04.643
-* In our dark backyard *
-You're treating it

39:04.710 --> 39:06.277
as a combinatorial
optimization problem?

39:06.344 --> 39:08.380
Yeah. Go with what you know,
right? What's wrong with that?

39:08.447 --> 39:10.949
Nothing, if limitations
on dates were discrete,

39:11.016 --> 39:12.350
but they're not.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.386
I mean, for instance,
social convention

39:14.453 --> 39:16.254
prohibits marrying on Tuesdays.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.390
(laughs) And you think
you're going to have better luck

39:18.457 --> 39:19.491
with the pigeonhole principle?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.092
You're likely to get a date

39:21.159 --> 39:22.327
five years from now.

39:22.394 --> 39:24.362
ALAN:
Is this what I think it is?

39:24.430 --> 39:26.264
Yes. A little
friendly competition.

39:26.331 --> 39:28.800
We're using math to find
a wedding date that works.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.069
I'm using math.
She's using some bastardized

39:31.136 --> 39:32.370
distant cousin.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.172
Whoever comes up
with a working date first

39:34.239 --> 39:36.107
gets to choose where we go
for our honeymoon.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.644
Ah. Well, sounds very normal.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.647
I'm sure it's how
all engaged couples do it.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.650
On the other hand, it was math

39:44.716 --> 39:46.585
that got you guys together
in the first place, so...

39:46.652 --> 39:49.488
* Don't walk away, then turn
and say "I love you anyway" *

39:49.555 --> 39:51.222
-Got it.
-Done!

39:51.289 --> 39:53.324
-I... all right.
-No, no, no, no.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.726
You know, you go ahead,
pigeon man.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.994
-What you got?
-Pigeon man.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.395
Yep.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.530
How about August 21?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.166
Yeah. My grandmother's
hip surgery.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.568
Nice try.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.102
The winner is...

40:04.169 --> 40:05.937
July 17.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.273
Oh, you mean your cousin
Vinay's graduation?

40:08.339 --> 40:09.407
(chuckles)

40:09.475 --> 40:10.642
ALAN:
Oh...

40:10.709 --> 40:13.545
Hey, how about October 9?

40:13.612 --> 40:16.214
Oh, that was yours
and Mom's anniversary.

40:16.281 --> 40:18.550
-Yeah, so what?
-I mean, I don't know, Alan.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.452
We were kind of thinking
we would leave that

40:20.519 --> 40:21.553
as, you know, your day.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.489
I'll share it.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.392
October 9.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.827
Yeah.
(giggles)

40:28.894 --> 40:31.429
So, it's settled? Finally?

40:31.497 --> 40:33.131
I can't believe
we actually have a date.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.432
We're getting married.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.201
Yes, we are.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.435
And I get to pick the honeymoon.

40:37.503 --> 40:38.937
* Don't walk away *

40:39.004 --> 40:43.408
-Mm. -* Then turn and say
"I love you anyway"... *

40:43.475 --> 40:45.611
(door opens)

41:00.125 --> 41:02.060
I thought Thursdays
were my place,

41:02.127 --> 41:04.462
but I guess
I got it wrong, huh?

41:06.164 --> 41:07.766
Come on, Don. Help me out.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.868
It took a lot for me
to come here.

41:09.935 --> 41:12.437
What do you want me
to say, Robin?

41:12.504 --> 41:15.674
Well, I don't know,
but I think we need to talk.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.876
-You asked me to marry you.
-And you said no.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.277
Well, don't you even want
to know why?

41:19.344 --> 41:20.478
(sighs)

41:20.546 --> 41:22.247
Okay.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.050
There wasn't a hint of romance
in the way that you asked me.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.622
Look, you know, I mean,
it wasn't official.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.490
I go to Charlie's,
and all they talk about

41:32.558 --> 41:35.561
is weddings, weddings, weddings,
and-and... I don't know.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.495
I think I just got
caught up in it,

41:37.563 --> 41:39.297
and-and I was feeling it out.

41:39.364 --> 41:40.599
Well, that's what I mean.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.806
Okay.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.509
You're this really romantic guy,

41:51.577 --> 41:53.845
with your old movies,

41:53.912 --> 41:55.146
and your old-fashioned values.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.115
You still open
the car door for me.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.919
And the fact that that was the
best that you could come up with

42:00.986 --> 42:02.754
tells me
you're not really ready.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.757
Well, I wouldn't have asked you
if I wasn't ready.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.626
You're going through a lot
of transitions, Don.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.461
At work, finding God.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.164
That motorcycle.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.169
You're searching for something.

42:18.236 --> 42:21.973
And you need to figure out
what that is first.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.813
Hey. I love you.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.816
And I promise you

42:30.882 --> 42:34.285
that I will say yes
when you're really ready.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.157
I thought I was.

42:40.425 --> 42:44.162
Until then,
let's just do what we do.

42:44.229 --> 42:48.800
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday--
my place.

42:48.867 --> 42:51.903
Tuesday, Friday, Sunday-- yours.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.040
That's complicated.

42:56.942 --> 42:59.645
Complicated works for us.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.119
(gunshot)
