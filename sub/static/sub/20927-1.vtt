01:01.762 --> 01:04.462

Once upon a time there was
a Frenchman who was not French.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.915
No, I'm not drunk.
I'm just talkative.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.517
Shh!

04:12.519 --> 04:16.257
Sorry to wake you. I'm just trying
to have a discussion with my wife.

04:16.259 --> 04:19.017
I was born in Greenwich Village,
New York City, New York,

04:19.026 --> 04:20.555
the United States of America.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.991
Shh!

04:45.019 --> 04:50.056
<i>My story starts where
every man's story starts.</i>

04:50.057 --> 04:51.687
<i>With Mom.</i>

04:51.692 --> 04:52.762
Sorry I'm late.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.656
I made supper for us.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.725
It's cold.
I'll heat it up.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.336
No. It's okay.
It looks good.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.537
<i>My father had died
a year earlier of cancer.</i>

05:06.540 --> 05:08.370
<i>My mom was a nurse.</i>

05:08.375 --> 05:11.735
<i>She was convinced that all such
disease could be prevented</i>

05:11.745 --> 05:14.645
<i>by mammoth intakes
of leafy, green vegetables.</i>

05:14.648 --> 05:18.418
<i>Specifically, she believed in the
magic of the brussel sprout.</i>

05:18.419 --> 05:20.849
Are you gonna finish
your brussel sprouts?

05:21.822 --> 05:24.522
I don't know, Mom.
I just started.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.525
If you want, I'll heat them up.
No.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.587
Fine.

05:27.594 --> 05:31.004
<i>She was lost without my father.</i>

05:32.766 --> 05:34.966
<i>But sometimes I could find her.</i>

05:34.968 --> 05:36.836
Mmm! Mmm!

05:36.837 --> 05:38.767
Mmm!

05:38.772 --> 05:40.972
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

05:40.974 --> 05:45.478
Oh, Mom, now that's
what I call a brussel sprout.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.647
Oh! Just melts
in your mouth.

05:47.648 --> 05:51.578
I don't know what Brussels was
thinking letting go of these.

05:53.754 --> 05:57.790
<i>And sometimes
she didn't want to be found.</i>

05:57.791 --> 05:58.921
Eighteen.

05:58.926 --> 06:02.126
Twenty take away two
equals eighteen.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.504
Okay, Mom.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.404
How was school?

06:12.406 --> 06:14.366
Fine.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.835
How was work?

06:15.843 --> 06:17.443
Fine.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.554
Want me to wash your hair?
No, thanks.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.094
Save me some hot water,
will you?

06:59.887 --> 07:03.117
<i>Sometimes she cried herself
to sleep.</i>

07:04.892 --> 07:07.532
<i>Sometimes she just cried.</i>

07:09.496 --> 07:12.826
<i>On those nights, the only way
to reach her was through</i>

07:12.833 --> 07:15.503
<i>her hatred of our president,
Richard Milhouse Nixon,</i>

07:17.104 --> 07:18.804
<i>whose nickname, Tricky Dick...</i>

07:18.806 --> 07:20.806
It's Tricky Dick.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.138
I am not a crook.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.442
<i>Inspired me to come up with</i>

07:24.445 --> 07:26.675
<i>novel uses for my socks
and shirts.</i>

07:26.680 --> 07:29.080
Watergate, Schmatergate.
That's all I have to say.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.681
My fellow Americans,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.586
I am not a crook.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.491
<i>My best friend's name
was Pappass.</i>

07:40.494 --> 07:43.164
<i>He was what you used
to call "retarded."</i>

07:43.165 --> 07:45.233
<i>We had a delivery boy job
together.</i>

07:45.234 --> 07:46.932
<i>If you wanted
wet toilet paper delivered</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:49.134
<i>to the back of your head,
we were your guys.</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:51.836
If I wanna exercise
my God-given freedom

07:51.839 --> 07:54.769
to experience people
getting cut up by chainsaws

07:54.775 --> 07:56.985
and hung on meat hooks,

07:56.993 --> 07:59.212
I think I have the constitutional
right to do so, don't you?

07:59.213 --> 08:01.913
We're gonna go to jail, Tommy.
Pappass.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.845
Hmm? We're not gonna go to jail.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.951
No? They don't throw
retards in jail.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.223
Just stay cool
and give me the dad-face.

08:08.224 --> 08:10.092
Okay?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.785
Everything will be okay.
Yeah.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.765
<i>Two for the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre, please.</i>

08:24.571 --> 08:28.171
<i>Two for the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre, please.</i>

08:28.175 --> 08:29.765
It's R, small-fry.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.076
No one under 16 without
parent or guardian.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.979
Oh, that's my parent
or guardian right there.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.600
Enjoy the cinema.

08:50.601 --> 08:51.797
Thank you.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.997
Thanks!

08:55.002 --> 08:57.540
Greenwich Village
Chainsaw Massacre!

08:59.072 --> 09:00.606
Time for school.
Yeah!

09:00.607 --> 09:02.107
Who wrote <i> Yellow Mattress?</i>

09:02.109 --> 09:03.776
I.P. Nightly.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.137
Uh,<i> Yellow River?</i>

09:05.145 --> 09:06.905
I.P. Daily.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.548
Um,<i> French Rupture?</i>

09:08.549 --> 09:11.249
Oh, oh, Jacques Too Tight.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.818
<i>Russian Rupture?</i>

09:12.819 --> 09:15.849
Ivanna Kutcharakov.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.316
Oh, don't do that!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.567
Sorry we're late, Simone.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.900
Sorry about that. What do I care
if you watch movies after school?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.586
I'm not your mother.

09:34.590 --> 09:36.270
How did you know
we were at the movies?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.136
How do I know?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.150
And the retarded one
still has an erection.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.215
I love scary movies.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.119
Psyche.
It's like a Blimpie.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.121
<i>Slavabogu,</i>
it's like a Bratwurst.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.193
You could sell it by the pound.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.298
Come here.
You're a good boy.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.235
Tommy, too.
Tommy wants to say his prayers.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.876
<i>Ah, Simone.
My first boss.</i>

10:10.877 --> 10:12.977
Well, at least
part of Simone, anyway.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.984
<i>I think this is where
my love of French began.</i>

10:25.359 --> 10:28.159
<i>People love delivery boys.</i>

10:28.161 --> 10:30.161
<i>And dogs loved the bike.</i>

10:30.163 --> 10:32.131
Hut!
<i>Maybe we were beloved</i>

10:32.132 --> 10:34.032
<i>because we took our job
so seriously.</i>

10:34.034 --> 10:36.168
It's Mick Jagger.

10:36.169 --> 10:41.107
<i>We even offered a service we
called "tenderizing the meat."</i>

10:41.108 --> 10:43.268
<i>Our number one concern,
of course,</i>

10:43.276 --> 10:45.836
<i>was to deliver the meat on time.</i>

10:47.381 --> 10:49.011
Get back here!

10:49.016 --> 10:50.976
Slow motion!

11:09.302 --> 11:11.402
Delivery, Mrs. Brevoort.
Jack?

11:11.405 --> 11:13.805
Is that you, son?
No, Mrs. Brevoort.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.007
It's Tommy and Pappass
from Simones'.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.276
We have your meat.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.107
Oh, boys. Hello.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.746
Hello.
Hello.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.747
How much?

11:21.748 --> 11:23.748
Um, five pounds.
69 cents a pound.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.150
Three, four, five.
Three, four, five.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.390
Three dollars and... 45
cents for the ground chuck.

11:27.391 --> 11:29.117
But at this price,
Mrs. B.,

11:29.122 --> 11:32.322
we like to refer to him as
"ground Charles."

11:32.325 --> 11:36.225
"Ground Charles."
Oh, you're a clever boy.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.259
And you've grown so.
How old are you now?

11:39.266 --> 11:40.866
Thirteen.
Twelve, liar.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.727
Thirteen in a couple weeks,
Pappass.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.036
I'm 41.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.438
Don't be in such a hurry to get old.
It's no fun.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.409
And here's a dollar for you.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.310
Actually, Mrs. Brevoort,
that's a ten.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.113
Here's a one.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.775
A dollar for a kiss from Thomas.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.957
And a dollar
for a kiss from Pappass.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.358
Pappass.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.262
Thank you,
Mrs. Brevoort.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.764
Good boy.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.242
You boys need a tip?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.281
Please.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.848
Okay, come on now.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.432
<i>We buried some of
our delivery tips</i>

12:47.434 --> 12:49.372
<i>outside the Women's
House of D.,</i>

12:49.373 --> 12:52.299
<i>a prison for women on
10th Street and 6th Avenue,</i>

12:52.305 --> 12:55.965
<i>so Pappass's dad didn't take
all of our money.</i>

12:55.976 --> 12:58.776
<i>I guess we figured
it was a safe place</i>

12:58.779 --> 13:01.179
<i>because the women
were already locked up.</i>

13:01.181 --> 13:03.411
<i>Sometimes we just came
for the conversation</i>

13:03.416 --> 13:06.276
<i>between the ladies
and their admirers down below.</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:09.246
You gotta bail me outta
here, Daddy. C'mon, I'm scared.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.916
I don't know about that, mama.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.194
Look like you're gonna have
to spend the night.

13:13.195 --> 13:16.063
I don't have the money at hand.
This here is for skin.

13:16.064 --> 13:19.562
You got to get me out of here!
I don't wanna argue with you.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.566
Don't walk away from me!
I'm through!

13:21.568 --> 13:23.398
I see your hat down there!

13:23.403 --> 13:26.843
Eight, fifteen.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.436
We did good today,
horn-dog.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.013
Mm-hm.
About 40 bucks to go

13:34.014 --> 13:36.452
and the beautiful, green lady
will be ours.

13:36.453 --> 13:38.579
You got any more dimes in there?

13:38.585 --> 13:41.185
No, I'm doing quarters.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.557
Don't be such a specialist.

13:45.559 --> 13:48.959
Branch out into dimes, Pappass.
You might like it.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.191
The beautiful, green lady.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.935
Park and lock, Thomas.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.276
Okay, good.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.121
Go ahead.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.322
Oh, yeah.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.256
People are getting cheap
with the tips

14:55.262 --> 14:57.162
or you boys went to the movies.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.332
Hey, haven't you heard?

14:58.333 --> 15:00.501
Nixon says we're in a recession.

15:00.502 --> 15:03.669
Inflation, oil embargo,
Yankees in the cellar...

15:03.670 --> 15:05.200
Horace Clark's at second base.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.035
Garbage strike, transit strike,
fiscal crisis.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.210
All right.
Suburban flight,

15:09.211 --> 15:10.576
soft rock, art rock, All right.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.177
All right, already!
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

15:12.178 --> 15:16.448
These are signs of the
apocalypse, I'm telling you.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.649
You know why
your mother died, son?

15:19.653 --> 15:22.922
She killed herself because
she had a retarded son.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.323
Isn't that right?
She got hit by a car.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.625
She walked in front of a car
because she had a retarded son.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.058
She was drunk.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.198
She was drunk
because her son's retarded.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.329
She was drunk 'cause she was
married to you, you loser.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.696
Up yours.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.271
Up yours, too.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.172
Up yours too, sir.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.375
"Up yours too, sir"
and good night.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.637
Bye-bye.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.346
Ah, ah, ah!

15:49.349 --> 15:52.049
Not until you can pass
the driver's test.

15:52.052 --> 15:56.252
When you can drive,
then you can drink.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.662
Yo.
Yo, who?

16:03.663 --> 16:04.663
Yo mama!

16:04.664 --> 16:05.731
Aha!

16:07.133 --> 16:09.601
Fat ass!
Go! Come on!

16:09.602 --> 16:12.538
<i>Our French teacher,
Madame Chiakipet.</i>

16:12.539 --> 16:14.269
Monsieur Warshaw?

16:14.274 --> 16:15.544
<i>Oui.</i>

16:17.744 --> 16:19.979
Um, I don't think so.

16:21.548 --> 16:25.118
Use <i> "Le Bonheur"</i> in a sentence
<i>S'il Vous plait.</i>

16:28.188 --> 16:31.058
<i>Our soul mission in life
was to make her say</i>

16:31.059 --> 16:33.187
<i>dirty words without knowing
what she was saying.</i>

16:33.193 --> 16:36.261
You have magnificent <i> Bonheur?</i>

16:36.262 --> 16:38.630
No, no, no.
<i>Oui, oui, oui.</i>

16:38.631 --> 16:42.371
<i>Sometimes we could get her to say some
pretty cool things. Le Bonheur,</i> uh...

16:42.372 --> 16:47.006
Good time, no?
<i>Le Bonheur</i> is happiness.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.338
Yeah. Oh, yeah, but...

16:50.343 --> 16:52.343
I'm sorry.
If I may correct you.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.705
In English, we say "hap-penis."

16:54.714 --> 16:56.548
"Hap-penis"?

16:56.549 --> 16:57.616
Hap-penis.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.747
"Hap-penis".
Penis.

16:58.752 --> 17:01.052
- "Penis"?
- Penis.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.321
"Penis."
Penis!

17:02.322 --> 17:04.061
Bon. Okay.
I have the "penis."

17:04.063 --> 17:05.487
Okay.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.256
Please, Monsieur Warshaw.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.731
You are my best student.

17:09.732 --> 17:11.195
Please focus.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.727
What?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.332
Focus.
Fuck what?

17:15.335 --> 17:16.694
Focus!
Us?

17:16.703 --> 17:19.403
Foc-us!
Foc-us!

17:19.406 --> 17:21.306
Come on, come on!

17:21.307 --> 17:24.207
Will you just focus
and give me the <i> Bonheur?</i>

17:40.560 --> 17:43.330
Strike one!

17:45.331 --> 17:46.698
That was a ball!

17:46.699 --> 17:48.299
Caught the corner!

17:49.202 --> 17:51.402
Talk to the chalk.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.544
Go again! Play ball!

17:58.178 --> 17:59.378
Oh! Ball!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.410
Strike two!

18:33.379 --> 18:36.248
Oh, bean ball! Rule 6.08B!

18:36.249 --> 18:39.779
"A batter is hit by a ball
he is not attempting to hit.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.646
Take your base."

18:42.655 --> 18:45.515
St. George leads St. Andrews
19-18. Play ball!

18:45.525 --> 18:47.285
Time-out.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.431
Time-out.
Time-out.

18:48.432 --> 18:50.498
Time-out. We're gonna get
a pinch-hitter.

18:50.499 --> 18:52.257
- Pappass, get in there.
- What?

18:52.265 --> 18:54.565
Pappass is on our team.
He's gonna pinch-hit.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.197
He's too old.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.702
Yeah.
He goes to our school.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.638
Pappass, show him your I.D.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.309
All right.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.669
St. Andrews School.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.506
That's only because
you're retarded.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.550
Don't use that word, Spaz.

19:07.551 --> 19:08.807
Well, he is, Melissa.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.545
Doesn't make it right.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.918
All right.
Let him hit.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.319
One more strike
and we win anyway.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.792
I'll just throw the cheese
right by him.

19:18.793 --> 19:20.529
Come on, Pappass!
Let's go!

19:20.530 --> 19:23.157
Come on, Mark!
Strike out the retard!

19:23.163 --> 19:27.266
No bagel, baby!
Look at the 'tard!

19:27.267 --> 19:30.427
Mark, you can beat the retard!

19:32.172 --> 19:34.472
You're standing on the plate.
Huh?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.214
Easy out! The plate!

19:36.215 --> 19:39.379
You knucklehead.
You're right in front of it.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.213
Strike him out!

19:43.216 --> 19:44.716
Retard!

19:45.785 --> 19:48.745
Mickey Mantle, Pappass.
Mickey Mantle.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.544
Yeah!

20:07.240 --> 20:08.710
Oh, no!

20:11.911 --> 20:13.641
Run for it!

20:16.783 --> 20:19.921
Get your balls out of my window,
you little creeps!

20:19.922 --> 20:23.488
I'm gonna come down there and
kick all your mothers' glasses!

20:23.489 --> 20:26.919
Maybe you guys should
get your own retard!

20:26.926 --> 20:28.786
Two in a row!
No!

20:28.795 --> 20:32.355
How come you go to an all-boys
school? That's for losers, man.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.425
We like girls. We
like the girls at your school.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.435
How about Melissa Loggia?

20:37.437 --> 20:39.767
I saw you checkin' her out
today, Tommy.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.242
Tommy don't like girls.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.905
Tommy don't like girls.
He likes his own hand.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.411
Come on, Tommy. We all know
you like her. Ah, she's flat.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.721
Pirate's dream...
sunken chest.

20:50.722 --> 20:53.917
Carpentry... flat as a
board and easy to screw.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.250
I've seen
bigger lumps in oatmeal.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.386
Whoa!

20:57.390 --> 20:58.690
Tommy don't like girls.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.030
30, 31, 32, 33...

21:36.029 --> 21:38.559
Good night, Ma.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.983
<i>Under the bed, I felt
safe 'cause I knew she was safe.</i>

21:56.749 --> 22:01.787
<i>As long as I could hear
her breathing, I could breathe.</i>

22:01.788 --> 22:04.458
<i>And I could draw.</i>

22:07.827 --> 22:10.427
<i>Because of some
bureaucratic shenanigans</i>

22:10.430 --> 22:13.100
<i>and some nonsense
in the U.S. Constitution</i>

22:13.101 --> 22:15.729
<i>called the separation
of Church and State</i>

22:15.735 --> 22:19.535
this class will no longer
be called Bible Study.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.506
It will be called Ethics.

22:21.507 --> 22:26.377
Well, that's my civic duty done. Now open
your Bibles, boys, to Genesis 19:4...

22:26.379 --> 22:29.848
Lot and his salty spouse.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.749
"And there came two angels to Sodom
that evening..." blah, blah, blah...

22:35.655 --> 22:38.755
"All the men of Sodom surrounded
Lot's house and demanded,

22:38.758 --> 22:41.088
"'Where are the men
who came to you tonight?

22:41.094 --> 22:43.794
Bring them out to us so that
we can have sex with them.'"

22:46.499 --> 22:50.469
Now don't get too excited, boys. The
story goes straight downhill from here.

22:50.470 --> 22:54.639
And now pitching

22:54.640 --> 22:56.908
for the Yankees,

22:56.909 --> 22:59.678
Mel-l-I

22:59.679 --> 23:02.948
Stottlemyre.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.419
The vegetation
that grew from the ground.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.818
Question...

23:06.819 --> 23:09.619
What was left after

23:09.622 --> 23:11.662
Lot's house was razed, hmm?

23:12.759 --> 23:13.989
Answer?

23:14.827 --> 23:17.157
Lot's lot.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.702
Anyhow...

23:23.703 --> 23:28.413
"But Lot's wife looked back longingly
and was turned into a pillar of salt."

23:29.642 --> 23:31.542
Why?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.951
Was God's soup too bland?

23:43.956 --> 23:47.656
No.
What does salt do?

23:48.895 --> 23:51.425
It preserves things.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.431
It keeps things from changing.

23:53.433 --> 23:57.803
Salt holds on.
She looked back "longingly."

23:57.804 --> 24:01.443
Well, surely it means that we should
not be attached to possessions

24:01.444 --> 24:03.211
and the things
of this world, no?

24:04.811 --> 24:08.151
Lot's wife looked back
because she missed her stuff.

24:08.152 --> 24:10.207
And for that immature longing,

24:10.216 --> 24:13.076
she was made into
a thing of bitterness...

24:13.085 --> 24:15.945
a pillar of salt.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.555
Ice cream.
"Pumping" pies.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.758
What kind of pies?
Pumpkin.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.190
In your store, you feature
109 different ice-cream flavors.

24:23.196 --> 24:25.756
You make 'em fresh every day.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.573
Small balls.

24:35.575 --> 24:38.005
How would you like it if
we said you had small balls?

24:38.010 --> 24:39.710
What?
Small balls.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.082
You said Melissa
was flat. Small balls?

24:42.083 --> 24:45.951
Small balls, small balls,
small balls with a basketball.

24:45.952 --> 24:49.252
Small balls! Small balls!

24:49.255 --> 24:51.255
Small balls!

24:58.998 --> 25:03.568
You gonna eat that brussel
sprout or just hypnotize it?

25:03.569 --> 25:05.637
I don't know, Mom.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.807
Are you all right?
Yeah.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.578
You sure?
I'm fine.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.652
How was school today?

25:16.549 --> 25:18.919
Fine.
Fine?

25:20.586 --> 25:22.646
Yeah.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.528
My monosyllabic son.

25:35.935 --> 25:39.565
You never talk to me anymore.
How come you don't talk to me?

25:39.572 --> 25:42.010
I talk to you, Mom.
You don't, you know.

25:42.011 --> 25:44.138
Mom, I... We're talking
now, aren't we?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.943
Don't be funny.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.121
I feel like a leper around you.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.590
Mom...

26:01.060 --> 26:04.829
Listen, I really can't go
back to that school anymore.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.960
St. Andrew's?
What are you talking about?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.596
We have to move.

26:08.601 --> 26:11.570
I did something bad.
I said something,

26:11.571 --> 26:13.238
and they hate me there.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.309
And the girls really,
really don't like me.

26:15.310 --> 26:18.008
What are you doing with girls?

26:18.010 --> 26:20.710
That's not the point, Mom. The point is,
is that we have to find another school.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.151
Don't tell me what
the point is, Tommy.

26:23.152 --> 26:26.349
Your scholarship is the point and getting
into a good college is the point.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.820
Girls are beside the point.

26:28.821 --> 26:32.591
Jesus, Tommy, what are you
trying to do to me?

26:32.592 --> 26:36.628
I'm not trying to do anything to you, Mom.
Forget it, okay?

26:36.629 --> 26:40.359
You tell me you're gonna piss away your scholarship
because of girls? I'm not gonna forget it.

26:40.366 --> 26:43.966
What am I working for?
Slaving away for you every day?

26:43.970 --> 26:46.240
Forget this!
Tommy! Where you going?

26:46.241 --> 26:47.706
Out!
Out where?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.667
Out, out.

26:49.675 --> 26:52.375
Go on. Now I know why
you're just like your father.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.981
He didn't run away,
Mom. He died.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.859
<i>A lot of times
when I was pissed off or upset,</i>

27:11.864 --> 27:14.402
<i>I used to go to the House
of "D" to count my money.</i>

27:14.403 --> 27:18.900
Why you checkin' out new girls when you can't
even take care of the ones you got, Andrew?

27:18.904 --> 27:21.922
What happened, baby?
Talk to me now.

27:21.923 --> 27:24.943
<i>I think maybe the money was the only thing
that made me feel powerful, gave me hope.</i>

27:24.944 --> 27:26.944
<i>I could change my life with it.</i>

27:26.946 --> 27:30.406
Hey, kid!
Hey, you...

27:30.416 --> 27:32.916
you with all the money!

27:32.918 --> 27:35.887
What's with all the change?
You rob a bus?

27:35.888 --> 27:39.288
Why don't you run over to Washington Square
Park and scope me a dime bag of weed?

27:39.291 --> 27:40.721
No way!

27:40.726 --> 27:44.926
Oh, I get it. You a mama's boy.
No, I'm not!

27:46.899 --> 27:49.968
Don't worry. I can't get down there
and steal that little money.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.869
Hey, I hear it's crazy in there.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.841
My mom says you got rats,

27:56.842 --> 27:58.942
roaches, lesbianism...

28:01.747 --> 28:05.377
Well, I guess I'm safe from the last one.
I'm in solitary.

28:05.384 --> 28:11.122
Why you buryin' money for anyway?
What are you, nine, eight, ten? What?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.358
Thirteen... almost.

28:13.359 --> 28:16.059
Thirteen, almost. Girls.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.429
How'd you know?

28:17.430 --> 28:20.760
I'm a genius. That's why I'm up here!
Now tell me...

28:20.766 --> 28:22.466
Tell you what?
About the girls.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.268
No way.
I don't even know you.

28:24.270 --> 28:27.400
Well, I ain't going anywhere.
Who am I gonna tell? My pillow?

28:27.406 --> 28:31.136
Come on. You dyin' to tell somebody.
It might as well be me.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.713
You got a crush on some girl.

28:32.714 --> 28:34.079
I don't.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.710
Just tell me.

28:37.183 --> 28:40.719
Her name's Melissa,
and, oh, man,

28:40.720 --> 28:42.950
she's so fine.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.285
But I told some of the guys
that she was flat.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.921
Flat.

28:46.926 --> 28:50.386
How you doin'?
Yeah, you know...

28:50.396 --> 28:53.996
Oh, you were showin' off. That's all right.
Everybody shows off sometime.

28:53.999 --> 28:57.938
Yeah, exactly. But I didn't mean it
to be mean or anything like that.

28:57.939 --> 29:02.907
And she heard about it, and like all
of her girlfriends came to my school

29:02.908 --> 29:06.177
and started kicking at me and screaming
and saying I had small balls.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.421
It's not funny.

29:13.422 --> 29:16.087
No, it's not.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.888
It's my uncle we're talking about.
Small, bald man, short, no hair.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.891
I mean, personally,
I like small balls.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.928
You do? Yeah!

29:23.929 --> 29:28.999
The other ones just get in the way. Bangin'
around in areas they have no business in.

29:29.001 --> 29:32.470
So, even if you do have
small balls, good for you!

29:32.471 --> 29:35.771
Hi.
Good for me?

29:35.775 --> 29:39.505
Yeah. And those girls don't
hate you. What's your name?

29:40.546 --> 29:43.046
Tommy.

29:43.048 --> 29:45.548
Those girls like you, Tommy.
That's why they bitchin' you out.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.321
That doesn't make any sense.

29:47.322 --> 29:50.049
Yes, it does.
Who's your best friend?

29:50.055 --> 29:51.885
Pappass.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.958
What kind of name is that?

29:53.959 --> 29:57.859
He's retarded, and Greek
on his father's side, I think.

29:57.863 --> 30:01.573
Well, don't you give this Pappass
more shit than anybody in the world?

30:01.574 --> 30:04.167
Yeah. I always
call him "Pappass."

30:04.170 --> 30:05.970
That's cause you two
are so tight!

30:05.971 --> 30:08.039
I guess.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.010
And that's how girls
your age are.

30:10.011 --> 30:13.079
If they really like you,
they treat you real bad.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.078
The more it seems they hate you,
the more they really like you.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.088
So I bet you this flat-chested
girl... What's her name?

30:22.089 --> 30:23.587
Melissa.

30:23.589 --> 30:28.059
I say this Melissa
likes you most of all.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.290
Now please come on
and give me that weed.

30:30.296 --> 30:33.856
I want to teach you
something about meat.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.096
Let me try.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.196
Oh, that's so cool.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.465
You keep it.
You need to study.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.873
You sure?

30:42.875 --> 30:44.875
For your 13th birthday.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.537
I got more.
Don't worry.

30:46.545 --> 30:49.145
Thanks. I can make
one of these.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.481
Delivery.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.155
Hey, Tommy,
do you ever miss your dad?

31:02.161 --> 31:03.428
All the time.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.498
You want mine?
No, thanks, Pappass.

31:05.499 --> 31:08.867
This is the longest delivery
in the history of meat!

31:08.868 --> 31:11.368
Engaging Apollo
retro rockets, Pappass, please!

31:11.370 --> 31:13.638
Go!
Going!

31:13.639 --> 31:16.608
Good girl, Daphne.

31:16.609 --> 31:20.879
<i>And the pitch.</i>

31:20.880 --> 31:24.210
<i>Lazy fly ball,
right center field...</i>

31:24.216 --> 31:26.646
<i>down near the bullpen
here at Fenway.</i>

31:26.652 --> 31:29.092
<i>and it's caught
right out there...</i>

31:30.923 --> 31:32.923
Hello.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.385
Delivery!

31:40.165 --> 31:41.155
Wow.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.526
Oh.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.935
Look at all this great art.

31:45.938 --> 31:49.207
Oh. It's like a museum.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.438
Not that you've ever been
to one.

31:51.443 --> 31:54.379
Look at the grapefruit.
I love grapefruit.

31:54.380 --> 31:58.280
Those aren't grapefruit,
Pappass. Those are lemons.

31:58.284 --> 32:02.587
It's a beautiful lemon.
I've never seen one this large.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.218
Oh, there you are.
Sorry. I was on the phone.

32:05.224 --> 32:09.364
Sweetheart, honey,
have you seen my purse?

32:10.562 --> 32:13.531
Sorry.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.332
Oh, great, thank you.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.603
Thanks, sweetie.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.604
Hi.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.035
Hi.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.271
Pirate's dream.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.175
Shut up.
How you doing?

32:25.177 --> 32:27.037
I'm good, I guess.
How you doing?

32:27.046 --> 32:32.446
Um, working.
I deliver meat and stuff.

32:32.451 --> 32:36.291
Yeah, I know. That's why
we ordered from your place.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.157
Really?

32:40.159 --> 32:41.326
Really?

32:41.327 --> 32:43.727
Really?

32:48.067 --> 32:49.567
Wow. What a view.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.637
I'd really like to paint this sometime.
Coming through.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.607
Can I have yours?
Sure.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.179
Thanks.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.013
Hey, I'm really sorry
about the, uh...

33:04.016 --> 33:07.416
you know, the flat incident.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.387
Carpenter's dream.
Pappass.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.988
Don't worry about it.
I am flat.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.459
No shit, Sherlock.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.327
No, you're not at all.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.028
You know,
when you turn sideways,

33:19.031 --> 33:22.367
like, you have a very, um...

33:22.368 --> 33:26.098
like a very, very nice...
profile.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.365
No tittie at all.
I've seen lemons bigger.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.707
Pappass!

33:29.708 --> 33:33.277
It's okay.
I really don't care.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.547
Yeah, well, like,

33:36.548 --> 33:38.448
me, neither.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.650
I have small balls, you know?

33:47.192 --> 33:49.062
But that's good, right?

33:49.795 --> 33:52.055
I don't know.

33:52.064 --> 33:55.033
I have a huge penis.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.407
You gonna go to the dance on Sunday?
No way, Jose.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.708
Can I finish your soda?
Yeah.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.210
Thanks.
Have as many as you want.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.541
What dance?

34:07.546 --> 34:11.306
Our school's hosting a dance
at your school.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.616
Hey, Tommy, you see she
has a fridge just for sodas.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.619
Are you gonna go to the dance?

34:15.621 --> 34:18.360
I'm only on
the decorations committee.

34:21.693 --> 34:22.726
What?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.288
Ow!

34:24.295 --> 34:26.326
Sorry. Thought you
had something there.

34:26.331 --> 34:30.271
Yeah, he's the peach fuzz kid.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.203
I shaved my ass once.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.273
Bald as a cue ball.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.347
What is this?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.320
What are you doing?

34:49.321 --> 34:51.351
Mom, I'm in the shower.

34:51.356 --> 34:54.456
Is that my razor?
No. Yeah.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.128
Are you shaving?
Yeah.

34:57.129 --> 34:59.129
You don't need to shave.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.331
Yeah, I do.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.503
Well, then get
your own damn razor.

35:03.504 --> 35:06.202
I found this in your pants.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.635
Oh, they're not mine.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.739
Whose are they?

35:08.740 --> 35:10.170
They're a present.

35:10.175 --> 35:11.475
From who?
A friend.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.207
What kind of a friend
gives a boy pornography?

35:14.213 --> 35:16.213
I'm not a boy, Mom.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.545
Oh, no. What are
you then, a girl?

35:20.486 --> 35:22.816
I'm flushing this filth
down the toilet,

35:22.821 --> 35:24.489
where it belongs.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.390
If you want it,
you can swim after it.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.366
Oh, shit, the littlest pimp.

35:35.367 --> 35:37.367
Young-blood
taking care of his lady.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.737
Good man.
Good little man.

35:39.738 --> 35:42.808
All right. All right.

35:44.209 --> 35:46.539
I ain't got to worry
about no competition, do I?

35:46.545 --> 35:49.375
No, sir.
Good. Catch you later.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.616
Tommy, you got my weed?

35:51.617 --> 35:53.477
No. Sorry.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.285
You don't love me, man.

35:55.287 --> 35:58.156
Hey, there's a dance
this Sunday.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.787
Oh, Melissa, right.
You gonna go?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.660
I don't have any clothes.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.861
Why don't you take some
of that money you ain't spending

36:04.863 --> 36:07.803
on my dime bag and get
you some pimp threads?

36:07.804 --> 36:10.699
I don't dance.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.672
That's too bad.
Girls like boys who dance.

36:12.673 --> 36:15.371
Even if you can't dance good.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.874
A girl like a guy who tries.

36:17.876 --> 36:21.646
And girls like guys who play
the fool for 'em.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.947
Solid.
According to you, lady,

36:23.949 --> 36:26.517
girls like fools
and small balls.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.486
So I'm pretty much covered.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.626
I know. Have yourself
a dance strategy.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.296
You wait out the fast stuff.

36:38.297 --> 36:42.297
All right? And if you can
walk, you can slow dance.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.231
Show me.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.566
No, not out here in public.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.712
I don't see no public.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.236
Come on. There's no music.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.475
Imagine some music.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.650
You see that pole over there?

36:58.784 --> 37:01.719
That pole?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.688
Yes, that pole.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.459
Look at the pole.
Walk toward the pole.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.290
You want this pole.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.525
No. No.

37:12.531 --> 37:14.661
Don't start your hands
down at the ass.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.326
Work your way down.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.295
Hi, I'm Tommy.

37:18.303 --> 37:21.639
You're very tall.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.875
She just said
she was "pole-ish."

37:25.877 --> 37:27.977
That's cute.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.580
Now you put your arms
out around the pole.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.350
Oh, you look like

37:34.353 --> 37:35.693
Frankenstein or something.

37:35.694 --> 37:38.317
You gonna scare the girl.

43:56.034 --> 43:57.734
Thanks.

43:57.736 --> 44:00.966
Your outfit is, um, orange.

44:00.972 --> 44:04.241
Orange.
Very orange.

This bike smells weird.

44:47.318 --> 44:50.348
What do you mean?

44:50.355 --> 44:53.185
It smells like pee.

44:57.762 --> 44:59.832
I don't smell anything.

45:18.917 --> 45:21.017
This is where I work.

45:21.019 --> 45:22.486
Cool.

45:22.487 --> 45:25.817
Yeah, my boss would kill me
if she knew I was here.

45:27.492 --> 45:29.727
This is a little public.

45:29.728 --> 45:32.898
Come on.
I know a private place.

45:53.118 --> 45:55.748
Yeah.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.221
This is private.

45:57.222 --> 45:59.857
But are these
what I think they are?

45:59.858 --> 46:02.158
Mm-hm.
It's a meat locker.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.260
And this is a dead sheep.

46:06.131 --> 46:07.761
That's so gross.

46:07.766 --> 46:09.996
It's okay.
I'll protect you.

46:31.489 --> 46:34.989
What are you thinking?

46:34.993 --> 46:37.333
About becoming a vegetarian.

46:40.398 --> 46:43.198
You cold?

46:43.201 --> 46:44.901
No.

47:08.393 --> 47:11.293
I think it's late.

47:11.296 --> 47:14.226
I'll take you home.

47:40.158 --> 47:42.458
I had a decent time.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.290
Me, too.

47:45.630 --> 47:48.360
I really liked kissing you.

48:54.699 --> 48:57.067
You lied to me.

48:57.068 --> 48:58.936
You lied to me!

48:58.937 --> 49:01.097
No, I didn't. Yes, you did.
You didn't go to work.

49:01.105 --> 49:03.705
You went to the dance
dressed like a clown.

49:03.708 --> 49:06.008
You don't do that!
I'm sorry.

49:06.010 --> 49:08.378
Don't do that.

49:08.379 --> 49:10.047
I'm sorry.

49:10.048 --> 49:12.416
Don't. Please.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.347
Don't lie to me ever again.
I won't.

49:17.422 --> 49:20.562
If you make a wish and don't
tell nobody, it could come true.

49:27.732 --> 49:30.702
Kissinger, Nixon and Agnew, and
I only got two bullets, right?

49:37.976 --> 49:39.306
Hey, Tommy.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.640
Hear about what happened
to Pappass?

49:41.646 --> 49:43.746
No, I was late this morning.

49:43.748 --> 49:46.218
He got caught stealing
a bike, and he got fired.

49:46.219 --> 49:48.547
I hear his dad's gonna send
him away to Willowbrook.

50:01.032 --> 50:04.132
I haven't seen Pappass today.

50:04.135 --> 50:06.435
He's probably scared to come in.

50:06.437 --> 50:09.037
What the hell I care
if he steal a bike?

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
He still has a job here.

50:11.042 --> 50:13.542
You Americans
with your morality.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.512
Pappass is a child.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.583
This Puritanism
drives me insane.

Lady!

51:17.075 --> 51:19.405
Tommy, that you?

51:19.410 --> 51:21.740
My little man.
How was the dance?

51:21.746 --> 51:23.706
The dance was great.
It's Pappass.

51:23.714 --> 51:26.721
He stole this bike,
and he just keeps disappearing.

51:26.722 --> 51:30.217
I went to try and find him,
and he's not coming home.

51:30.221 --> 51:33.721
What bike did he steal? It's this
bike that we were saving up for.

51:33.724 --> 51:38.163
After the dance, I took Melissa to the
meat locker, so we could be alone.

51:38.164 --> 51:41.198
You left the Papoose. Yeah,
'cause he had work to do.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.729
I've been trying to catch him, and
he won't go home. It's your fault.

51:43.734 --> 51:46.203
And he's gonna lose his job.
It's your fault!

51:46.204 --> 51:47.604
What?

51:47.605 --> 51:50.335
That's your buddy.
He stole that bike for you.

51:50.341 --> 51:54.141
He knows you're going
someplace he can't go.

51:54.145 --> 51:56.745
I'm not going anywhere.
Where am I going?

51:56.747 --> 51:59.147
Not where you're going,
but what you're becoming.

51:59.150 --> 52:02.150
What am I becoming?
Something he can't.

52:02.153 --> 52:04.121
A man.

52:04.122 --> 52:06.122
That's bullshit.

52:06.124 --> 52:08.864
I'm not gonna take the blame
for something that Pappass did.

52:08.865 --> 52:12.129
No, Tommy, it's not bullshit.
That's love.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.260
That's love.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.346
Tommy!

52:29.347 --> 52:30.477
Pappass!

52:30.481 --> 52:33.481
Nobody can catch us now.

52:33.484 --> 52:35.224
Pappass, why'd you steal it?

52:35.225 --> 52:37.449
'Cause I'm a bad man, Tommy.

52:37.455 --> 52:38.685
Did you steal it for me?

52:38.689 --> 52:40.619
You wish.
You know what? Let me...

52:40.625 --> 52:44.225
You don't think I know, but I do.
Calm down.

52:44.228 --> 52:47.658
I know what I know, and I
know what I don't know.

52:47.665 --> 52:49.165
I know.

52:49.167 --> 52:50.767
Calm down.

52:50.768 --> 52:53.668
They took away my job, Tommy.

53:15.226 --> 53:17.556
So you mean to say it was you

53:17.562 --> 53:20.830
and not Mr. Pappass
that stole the bike.

53:20.831 --> 53:22.566
Yes.

53:22.567 --> 53:25.767
Well, that's not in character.

53:25.770 --> 53:28.700
That's not the Tom Warshaw
I know.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.766
Why did you steal something?

53:31.776 --> 53:33.506
I wanted it.

53:33.511 --> 53:34.841
Oh.

53:34.845 --> 53:38.375
Even though I know
not to covet material things,

53:38.382 --> 53:39.922
like Lot's wife.

53:42.353 --> 53:44.323
It's a beautiful damn bike,
though.

53:44.324 --> 53:46.362
What would you call that green?

53:46.363 --> 53:47.617
Sorry, sir.

53:47.625 --> 53:51.585
The green of the bicycle.

53:51.596 --> 53:52.896
Al green.

53:52.897 --> 53:55.797
Al green.

53:55.800 --> 54:00.000
Hmm. It's
a lovely Al green.

54:00.004 --> 54:04.274
Oh, yes.

54:04.275 --> 54:06.905
Thanks for coming forward, Tom.

54:06.911 --> 54:09.711
You're suspended for a week.

54:09.714 --> 54:11.984
And of course, your scholarship
will come under review.

54:11.985 --> 54:13.983
You can finish up
your classes today

54:13.985 --> 54:16.245
and get the rest
of the assignments for the week

54:16.254 --> 54:18.324
so you don't fall behind.

54:21.692 --> 54:23.792
Your mother will
be very disappointed.

54:23.794 --> 54:26.034
Yes, sir.

54:29.033 --> 54:30.633
<i>Les enfants,</i>

54:30.635 --> 54:31.795
this is a popped test.

54:31.802 --> 54:33.842
Please focus.

54:36.274 --> 54:40.544
Mr. Warshaw, could I have
a moment of your time, please?

54:42.913 --> 54:47.423
You stay right here, Mr.
Pappass. Yes, sir.

54:52.490 --> 54:56.059
We're on the horns
of a dilemma here, Mr. Warshaw.

54:56.060 --> 54:59.829
When I met with Mr. Pappass
to reinstate him

54:59.830 --> 55:01.810
in his custodial capacity,

55:01.815 --> 55:03.795
I told him that you had come
forward about the bicycle theft

55:03.801 --> 55:06.639
and were willing to accept
an appropriate punishment.

55:06.640 --> 55:10.307
He got very agitated and told me
once again he stole the bike.

55:10.308 --> 55:13.508
Only now he's telling me that
he stole the bicycle for you.

55:13.511 --> 55:15.511
Pappass.

55:15.513 --> 55:18.513
Don't talk to Mr. Pappass.
Talk to me.

55:18.516 --> 55:20.546
Who is responsible?

55:20.551 --> 55:22.651
I am. I stole
the bike for Tommy.

55:22.653 --> 55:23.953
Shut up, Pappass.

55:23.954 --> 55:26.864
I threw a lemon,
huge beautiful lemon.

55:27.958 --> 55:31.828
As if he were
in your employ, Tommy.

55:31.829 --> 55:35.359
A minion and you a ringleader,
he stole the bike for you?

55:37.368 --> 55:39.998
That's right.

55:40.004 --> 55:43.673
I was supposed to be normal, but I didn't
get enough oxygen when I was born.

55:43.674 --> 55:46.676
Will you be quiet,
Mr. Pappass?

55:46.677 --> 55:49.037
Theft is one thing, Tommy.

55:49.046 --> 55:53.676
A momentary lapse in judgment,
covetousness, ultimately forgivable.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.984
There's no oxygen
right now, either.

55:55.986 --> 55:59.586
But this psychological usury,
this web of deceit,

55:59.590 --> 56:02.620
this Machiavellian domination
of a weak-minded,

56:02.626 --> 56:07.556
pitiful man goes beyond
one isolated act

56:07.565 --> 56:12.395
and speaks to a fundamental and frankly
disturbing deficit in character.

56:12.403 --> 56:15.803
Do you have anything to say
for yourself, Mr. Warshaw?

56:15.806 --> 56:18.536
Pappass stole the bike for me.

56:21.545 --> 56:24.075
I'm profoundly disappointed
in you.

56:24.081 --> 56:27.550
Profoundly.
You go home right now.

56:27.551 --> 56:29.689
The school will contact
your mother

56:29.690 --> 56:31.817
with further disciplinary
action.

56:58.916 --> 57:01.716
Oh, man, you took three already.

57:04.555 --> 57:07.155
Three. 18 take away 15
equals 3.

57:08.692 --> 57:11.092
I took some sedative.

57:11.095 --> 57:15.755
And I want to go to "bedative."

57:15.766 --> 57:17.126
Mom.

57:19.837 --> 57:21.797
Oh, Tommy, Tommy,

57:21.806 --> 57:24.936
they want to take away
your scholarship.

57:24.942 --> 57:26.942
You're gonna end up
in the gutter. You know that?

57:26.944 --> 57:28.611
They want to expel you.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.712
I'm not gonna wind up
in the gutter, Mom.

57:30.714 --> 57:33.152
Without an education, you're
gonna end up in the gutter.

57:33.153 --> 57:35.819
I'm not gonna end up in the gutter.
Don't worry. Yes, you are!

57:35.820 --> 57:38.550
No, no.
You know why you're not?

57:38.556 --> 57:42.016
Because we're gonna fight 'em, and
we're gonna beat 'em. Exactly.

57:42.026 --> 57:44.956
They're not even fit to lick our boots.
We'll fight 'em.

57:44.962 --> 57:49.566
And we'll win, Tom-ass.

57:49.567 --> 57:52.936
Mom? What? That's what
Pappass calls you, right?

57:52.937 --> 57:55.567
Sometimes, Mom-ass.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.941
Very clever.

57:57.942 --> 58:00.210
Go on now.

58:00.211 --> 58:03.211
Quit hovering over me
like a mother hen.

58:06.484 --> 58:09.524
You're gonna...
You're gonna smother me.

58:50.928 --> 58:52.158
Mom!

58:53.964 --> 58:55.932
Mom, wake up.

58:55.933 --> 58:58.033
Mom, wake up!

59:04.708 --> 59:08.608
Operator, my mom!
It's my mom!

59:34.872 --> 59:37.312
Hey, Mom, what day is it today?

59:44.982 --> 59:47.116
I thought so.

59:47.117 --> 59:51.817
Mom, look.
It's the 20th.

59:51.822 --> 59:54.090
It's the 20th.
Mom.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.359
I'm 13 today.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:13.776
<i>What is it? Tommy?</i>

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:17.947
Yes, ma'am, there's a Tommy
here who wants to see Melissa.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.717
Uh-huh, I understand. Yeah.

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:22.878
No, I understand completely
Mrs. Logan, really. Okay.

01:00:22.886 --> 01:00:25.986
Sorry, kid, you can't go up.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:28.157
Why not?
I don't know.

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:30.788
Can you ask
if Melissa can come down?

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.134
No, I can't do that, kid.
Come on, take off.

01:00:33.135 --> 01:00:34.297
Why not?

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:37.066
Now, hey, I'm sorry. Listen.,

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:38.867
Life is long, you know?
Live it up.

01:00:38.869 --> 01:00:40.269
How old are you anyway?
Maybe 15?

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.838
13.

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.139
13?

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.270
Ah, you'll forget her
in a week. Take off.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:59.716
Who the hell are you?

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:01.117
Tommy, hi.

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.154
You don't remember me?

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:07.855
I'm Monty Bean.

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:10.128
And this is my wife,
Sandra Head-Bean.

01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:13.496
Hi, Tommy.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:15.227
I-I'm your mom's
second cousin.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:18.832
Now, we've come down from
Toronto to take care of you...

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:21.136
till things settle down.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.068
And we so love New York.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.373
What does "settle down" mean?

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.136
Arrangements have to be made,

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:30.775
e.g., the subject
of the guardian.

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:32.451
You're a minor.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:37.153
Your mom's not comin' back.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:40.864
I thought you had this conversation
with the doctor. I did.

01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:43.858
You didn't understand, then.
I understood.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:47.401
She took too many sedatives by
mistake, so she has brain death.

01:02:47.402 --> 01:02:50.967
She is,
"persistently vegetative."

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:52.998
And I'll take care of my mom,

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:56.773
not you, or you... me.

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.437
Well,

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.945
regardless,

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:07.416
we, Sandra and me,

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:08.917
will be looking after you

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.919
until it's decided
where you can be.

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:13.261
Have you given a thought
to military school?

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:56.228
Goddamn it, Pappass.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:58.568
Lady!

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:02.199
Tommy!
Got my dime bag?

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:03.436
What's your name?

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.209
I like you calling me "Lady."

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.978
I want to know your <i> real</i> name.

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:10.609
Why?

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.284
Because I want to know who
to blame for ruining my life!

01:04:13.285 --> 01:04:16.219
I want to know your real name!

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.350
Well, what happened?

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:20.494
Nothing. I just did what you
said and the shit hit the fan.

01:04:20.495 --> 01:04:23.559
I got expelled,
Melissa won't see me

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.500
and my mom... my mom O.D.'d
because of me!

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:30.099
Your mom what, Tommy?

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.100
She took pills
because I got expelled.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:35.071
Oh.

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:36.972
She's in a coma.

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:39.512
Well, what about your daddy?
My dad's dead!

01:04:39.513 --> 01:04:40.939
And there's this stupid...

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.919
Those military people
in my house!

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.387
Oh!

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.156
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:56.257
They're...

01:04:56.260 --> 01:05:01.160
Lady, there are people
I don't know at my house!

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.603
Man!

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.010
Man, life is hard.

01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:20.915
But you a lucky man!

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.918
Be free!

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.490
What?

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:28.189
Run!
Where?

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:29.659
Where am I gonna go?

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.290
Anywhere!

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.185
You a man!

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.156
You free! Go!

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:38.095
I want to wait for you.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:42.601
Lady, I want to see you.

01:05:51.682 --> 01:05:53.616
I want to see you!

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.577
Boy, you will <i> never</i> see me!

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:58.486
Why?

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:01.057
You know why I'm in here, boy?
No.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.688
I murdered my husband

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:05.293
in his sleep with my bare hands.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.160
I'm a murderer!

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.566
I hate men!

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:13.397
And if they let me out
this bitch, I'll kill again!

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:16.473
I mean, if you get in my way,
I might even kill you!

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:19.635
I don't care.

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:24.447
Look, I'm not playing with you
no more, Tommy.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.048
Run!

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:27.579
Get out of here!
Get away from me!

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:30.753
And stop looking up at me like that!
I ain't your lady!

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:34.290
I ain't your mama!
I can't help you!

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:36.121
I ain't got nothin' for you!

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:38.656
You wanna know my name, little boy?
Yeah!

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:44.466
My name is
Bernadette Odelia Glasser!

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:48.668
And I never want
to see you again, Tommy!

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:53.311
Get away from me. Run!

01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:30.411
What's that?
Who's there?

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.149
Jack, is that you?

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.420
Oh, Jack, my son.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:41.157
My beautiful boy.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:44.727
Why have you
stayed away so long?

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:47.358
I, uh...

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.098
I was in trouble.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:50.299
Trouble?

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.630
I'm in trouble.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:54.395
Must you go away again, Jack?

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.304
Yeah.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:59.266
It's not because
you don't love me, is it?

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:02.676
I was so afraid
you didn't love me.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.579
No.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.479
You love your mama?

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:10.794
Yeah, I love my mama.

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.092
Is that my money?

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.192
Oh, good.

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.356
Take the money.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.337
Good boy.
Take the money.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:37.245
Thank you, Miss...

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.176
Mama.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:58.693
She's not breathing.
Get the doctor.

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:44.667
Okay, you've gotta give me
the dad-face one last time,

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.374
okay, Pappass?

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:47.706
Okay.

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:49.711
Otherwise, keep
your mouth shut, okay?

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:51.483
Okay.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:55.476
How many sleeps
will you be away?

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.590
How many sleeps
till you come back here?

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:04.534
Not too long, Pappass.
Hmm.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.861
Hey, who wrote <i>French Rapture?</i>

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:12.526
I don't know.

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:15.970
All right.
To Paris.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:27.721
You're quite young to be paying for
your own plane ticket, aren't you?

01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:30.617
Oh, this is my dad.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:37.058
You know, actually,
Dad has laryngitis

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.960
and he shouldn't
be talking at all.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.862
It's not good for his throat.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.734
Mm-hm.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.027
Um, I'm sorry, sir,

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:47.395
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:51.940
Some identification?

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:55.081
Dad, show him your I.D.
Dad!

01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:58.979
You know, your I.D., Dad?

01:12:01.384 --> 01:12:02.551
I can't talk.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:03.822
Right.

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:09.923
Look, I'm just gonna
make a phone call.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:12.786
What the Sam
Hill is going on here?

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:18.096
Sir? I'm not gonna be late
to work because of you!

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:21.401
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm just doing my job.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:22.744
Me, too.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.540
See this uniform?

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:27.076
St. Andrews School for boys.

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.577
Assistant janitor.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:31.008
I don't think you're
gonna be very happy

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.924
if I have to call the Reverend
Duncan down here to talk to you.

01:12:33.925 --> 01:12:35.417
Who?

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:37.348
Reverend Duncan.

01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:41.488
Look, um, I'm a Christian, too.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:43.021
Good! Now, give the kid
his ticket!

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.564
Okay, all right.
Just, um...

01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:51.526
Just give me a minute.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.734
You retard!

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:22.527
I don't want you to take
any shit off your dad, okay?

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:25.401
Okay.
And, um, listen.

01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:28.172
Stop drinking so much soda
'cause you're gonna get fat.

01:13:28.173 --> 01:13:30.806
Yeah.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.667
And...

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:37.575
if you have a problem at school,
you can talk to Duncan.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.416
'Cause he's not a total jackass.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.047
And listen, if Simone...

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:44.421
Do good things, Tommy.

01:13:52.061 --> 01:13:55.061
Promise me...

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.800
you do good things.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:14:00.441
I promise.

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:15.647
Thomas.

01:14:18.855 --> 01:14:20.145
Shh.

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:01.062
<i>I told my wife
everything that night.</i>

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:02.564
<i>How, when I came to Paris,</i>

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:05.565
<i>I slept on the streets
for a while until I got a job</i>

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:08.537
<i>drawing for the fashion magazines
and could support myself...</i>

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:10.706
<i>that I
pretty much erased my past</i>

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:11.707
<i>and kept to myself</i>

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:14.608
<i>until I met her</i>

01:15:14.611 --> 01:15:17.281
<i>and wanted to start
my own family.</i>

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:29.619
I was in the habit of never telling
anybody anything about my past.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:31.556
But when I was
falling in love with you,

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:33.130
every morning
I'd wake up and think,

01:15:33.131 --> 01:15:34.796
"Today's the day
I'm gonna tell her,"

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:36.127
and every morning
I'd say nothing.

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:38.901
Eventually, just too much
time past and I...

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:41.837
I felt that if I told you now,

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:43.788
you'd get scared and disgusted

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.739
that I could lie so well,
so long, and you'd leave me.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:49.082
And you didn't tell me
and I did leave you anyway.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:55.077
Well, that's what we in America
like to call irony.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:10.160
<i>I talked all night,</i>

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:12.726
<i>probably more than
I'd talked to her in a year.</i>

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.595
<i>And when the sun came up,</i>

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:15.944
<i>it was my turn to listen.</i>

01:16:15.945 --> 01:16:21.139
I always know you have
an empty nest in your heart.

01:16:21.144 --> 01:16:24.254
And I was a little afraid for Dan
and me that maybe you're cold.

01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:27.247
Well, that's why
I'm telling you this.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.117
So you know me.

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:31.188
These are just words.

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:34.256
You need to start over.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:37.887
To New York, you go.

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.229
I can't just start over.

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:45.031
And yet you want us
to start over?

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:50.807
You need to go back, Tom.
To move ahead.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:55.179
I'm scared to go back
to New York.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:17:01.916
A man is a man only when he can
be himself wherever he is.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.153
I want this man.

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:10.324
Odell needs this man.

01:17:10.326 --> 01:17:14.296
Otherwise, this is just
a bedtime story.

01:18:26.936 --> 01:18:28.936
<i>I'm not gonna recognize her</i>

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:30.468
from any of these mug shots,

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:33.043
'cause I never really got
a good look at her face.

01:18:33.044 --> 01:18:36.142
I know she was black.
At least her hand was black.

01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:39.145
I do know she was in prison
for murdering her husband.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:41.178
No, no, that's not possible.

01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:43.719
How do you mean?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.820
Well, the women's
house of detention

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:47.222
was not maximum security.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:50.061
A murderer would
never have been held there.

01:18:50.062 --> 01:18:51.729
She told me
she murdered her husband.

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:53.488
Why would she lie?

01:18:58.201 --> 01:18:59.831
To make me run.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.270
To make me run away.

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:35.136
Bernadette?

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:39.413
Bernadette Odelia,
my name is Tom Warshaw.

01:19:39.414 --> 01:19:41.478
Can I come in?

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.049
It's Tommy, Bernadette.
I think we may have spoken

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:47.878
many years ago when I was a kid

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:50.424
and you were in the
women's house of detention.

01:19:50.425 --> 01:19:52.249
Maybe you don't remember.

01:19:56.526 --> 01:19:59.256
I just wanted you to know
that I'm alive and I...

01:20:00.997 --> 01:20:03.527
I made it to Paris.
I have a wife and a son.

01:20:09.872 --> 01:20:11.472
My son's name is Odell.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:16.483
Odell for Odelia.

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:40.003
I'm gonna leave a little
present out here for ya.

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:43.604
Sorry, it's still
not your dime bag.

01:20:47.243 --> 01:20:48.543
Tommy!

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:53.007
Lady!

01:20:58.254 --> 01:20:59.954
You have a beautiful face.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.928
Tommy, we did what we had to do,

01:21:06.929 --> 01:21:09.229
didn't we?

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:12.029
It's all right.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:14.069
She understands.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:18.070
Your poor mama.

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:22.244
She understands a boy have
to go away before he come back.

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:30.549
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.963
Run, Tommy.

01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:46.301
I don't have to run anymore.
Lady, I can walk now.

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:49.571
I know you can walk.

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.640
And I know you can dance.

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:53.941
But I'm saying,

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:57.579
this is a bad neighborhood
for a lone white boy.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.010
Now, run.

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:05.650
Run! Run!

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.520
Run, Tommy!

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:43.317
Hey.

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:09.577
Sweet wheels.

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:11.146
Check it out.

01:24:11.147 --> 01:24:13.807
Mmm.
You live in the neighborhood?

01:24:13.816 --> 01:24:17.376
Yeah. Born and raised.

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.116
Maybe you can help me then.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:20.591
I've been trying
to figure something out.

01:24:20.592 --> 01:24:23.719
I've forgotten who wrote this
famous book I once read

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:25.826
uh,<i> French Rupture.</i>

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:30.157
Remember who wrote that?

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:32.326
Is that Ivanna Kutcharakov?

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:36.604
No. Ivanna Kutcharakov
wrote <i> Russian Rupture.</i>

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:39.105
Obviously, I. Kutchyarokov's
a Russian name.

01:24:39.108 --> 01:24:40.668
Oh, all right.

01:24:40.676 --> 01:24:44.236
<i>French Rupture</i> was
written by Jacques Tootight.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:45.746
Oh, that's a French name.

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:47.348
Obviously.
That makes sense.

01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:50.579
Sweet ride.
That's beautiful.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:53.246
What about <i> Chinese Rupture,</i>
you remember who wrote that?

01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:55.255
One Hung Lo.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.087
That's a Chinese name.
Yeah.

01:24:58.094 --> 01:24:59.727
Makes sense.
Yeah.

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:02.458
What about <i> Open Kimono?</i>
You remember that?

01:25:02.465 --> 01:25:05.595
<i>Open Kimono?</i>
Who wrote that?

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.671
Do I look like a library to you?

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.707
No, I was just...

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.308
Get out of here.

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:15.710
I was just trying to...

01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:17.311
Come on, buddy.
Get a life.

01:25:25.855 --> 01:25:29.215
Tommy!
Psyche.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.172
I saved your Bible.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:23.713
All the little floating balls,
I saved them.

01:26:23.714 --> 01:26:25.880
I call it your baseball bible.

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:27.781
I saved it for you.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:34.855
You drew that.

01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:41.196
You forgive me, Pappass?
Yeah.

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:42.557
For what?

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:48.570
Look at you, Tom-ass.
What?

01:26:48.571 --> 01:26:49.701
Look at you.

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:51.335
Look at me what, Pappass?

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:53.710
You have
the dad-face now.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:10.558
My dad died...
a lot of sleeps ago.

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.589
Cancer ate him,
just like your dad.

01:27:12.595 --> 01:27:15.295
Cancer is the crab
on the horoscope.

01:27:15.297 --> 01:27:17.697
Crab dinner, $6.95,
all you can eat.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.367
Sorry, Pappass.

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:22.437
It's okay, 'cause the crab
ate all the hard parts first,

01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:23.968
the mean parts.

01:27:23.973 --> 01:27:26.841
The parts that hate me
being retarded.

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:29.782
Just before he died
when he was only mostly dead,

01:27:29.783 --> 01:27:31.548
he was so nice.

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:36.581
'Cause only the soft parts
were left.

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:38.715
He was the nicest guy
in the world.

01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:40.751
He hugged me, and he
told me over and over,

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:43.616
he loved me, he loved
me, he loved me.

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.828
Pappass.

01:27:46.829 --> 01:27:48.559
I hate seafood.

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:53.868
You know, Tommy, sometimes
I think the crab ate me

01:27:53.869 --> 01:27:56.269
while I was still
in my mom's belly.

01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:58.772
I think it ate
all my smart parts.

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.844
Do you think that's
what happened, Tommy?

01:28:00.845 --> 01:28:02.583
No.
No?

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:06.880
I think you got
plenty of smart parts, Pappass.

01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:09.382
Yeah.

01:28:11.553 --> 01:28:17.292
Chinese takeout, ESPN,
some nice cold orange soda.

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:21.063
Ooh, I could get used
to a Koosh joint like this.

01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:25.369
That's more numbers
than I've ever dialed.

01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:27.967
Who are you calling, a girl?

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:30.872
Tommy's got a girlfriend!

01:28:31.874 --> 01:28:34.409
Not a girl, Pappass,
it's a lady.

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:35.840
A <i> lady.</i>

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:41.647

Mmm. Loser.

01:28:48.957 --> 01:28:50.817
A lady.

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:56.858
Hey. This is your
American phone pal.

01:29:20.489 --> 01:29:22.019
Hey, Dad!

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:23.624
Hello?

01:29:27.463 --> 01:29:28.663
Remember me?

01:29:28.664 --> 01:29:30.434
Hold on, partner.
Hey!

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:34.869
Hey!

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:37.370
Where's Odell?
Why didn't you bring him?

01:29:37.373 --> 01:29:38.973
I much like the service
at this hotel.

01:29:38.974 --> 01:29:40.774
Over here!
There's Odell!

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:43.784
Very funny, Dad.

01:30:00.429 --> 01:30:02.559
Pappass! Slow down.
I got a passenger!

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:04.064
Where are you taking us?

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:07.596
That's for me to know
and you to find out!

01:30:13.075 --> 01:30:14.935
Almost there!

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.019
Okay.

01:30:27.723 --> 01:30:30.193
Well, Pappass, where are we?
If that's, uh...

01:30:30.194 --> 01:30:32.732
That's Jefferson Market,
there. Then...

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:35.959
Women's House of D.

01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:42.085
What is it, Daddy?

01:30:42.086 --> 01:30:44.066
There used to be
a prison here, Odell.

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:48.072
Yes. There used to be a
courthouse and a prison.

01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:49.936
And now, there's a library

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.705
and a beautiful garden.

01:30:52.714 --> 01:30:54.584
Places change
like people change,

01:30:54.585 --> 01:30:55.817
you know, like...

01:30:55.818 --> 01:30:57.818
when you start grow,
Odell, down...

01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:59.950
you know what
I'm talking about, right?

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:01.855
Yeah, for example,

01:31:01.857 --> 01:31:04.457
I'm not retarded anymore.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.660
Oh, really?
Really.

01:31:05.661 --> 01:31:06.791
When did that happen?

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.925
Oh, 1984.

01:31:08.931 --> 01:31:10.931
Sometime in the spring.

01:31:10.933 --> 01:31:14.202
I went from retard,
to mentally handicapped.

01:31:14.203 --> 01:31:18.072
And then, in 1987, '88,

01:31:18.073 --> 01:31:21.073
I went from handicapped
to challenged.

01:31:21.076 --> 01:31:22.236
I changed again.

01:31:22.244 --> 01:31:24.584
I'm probably changing
right now, you know?

01:31:24.585 --> 01:31:26.580
Who knows what I'll be next?

01:31:26.582 --> 01:31:29.250
See? There's hope
for you, Dad.

01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:31.551
Oh? There's hope for me?

01:31:31.553 --> 01:31:34.091
Your dad loved change
more than anyone.

01:31:34.092 --> 01:31:35.859
We had a bike riding job
together,

01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.918
and we saved up all that change.

01:31:37.926 --> 01:31:40.686
And I took the change,
and I threw it in the river.

01:31:40.696 --> 01:31:42.796
And I made a wish
that there was no change,

01:31:42.798 --> 01:31:46.928
but the change made
everything change.

01:31:46.935 --> 01:31:49.565
And this is the place
where we buried our change.

01:32:00.549 --> 01:32:02.149
"Boner."

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.852
