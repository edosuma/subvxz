00:04.070 --> 00:06.205
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:08.407
<i>Was a child,</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:11.710
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.413 --> 00:16.248
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:18.083
To save herself and her people,

00:18.085 --> 00:21.286
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.288 --> 00:24.023
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire--</i>

00:24.025 --> 00:25.691
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:27.693
<i>Forces of the heart.</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:29.762
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:33.365
Francis: <i>Previously on</i> reign...
Marry me.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.701
Yes, yes.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.569
Catherine:
<i>Nostradamus</i>

00:37.571 --> 00:39.438
Believes that someday
you will be the cause

00:39.440 --> 00:41.407
Of francis' death.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.042
Walk away from this marriage.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.276
Nostradamus:
All images of francis' death

00:44.278 --> 00:45.411
Are tied to your union.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.578
I don't believe any of it.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.047
Nostradamus: <i>I see your ladies</i>

00:48.049 --> 00:49.581
<i>Circled around;</i>
<i>one among you will die.</i>

00:49.583 --> 00:51.316
Aylee.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.785
As queen of scotland, I
have made a decision.

00:52.787 --> 00:55.054
I lay no claim
to the english throne.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.588
What if you were legitimized?

00:56.590 --> 00:59.191
You're talking about changing
the line of succession.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.559
And that's the sort of talk

01:00.561 --> 01:03.328
That gets bastards
and mistresses beheaded.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.797
Diane:
<i>Catherine has sworn</i>
<i>to keep our secret,</i>

01:04.799 --> 01:06.198
<i>But she can't be trusted.</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:07.499
She can't control me or you

01:07.501 --> 01:08.667
If she can't catch us.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.070
Go on your own; leave today.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.371
Where are you going?
Far.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.106
That's my destination as well.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.541
Mary! Mary, please!

01:20.680 --> 01:23.248
(horse whinnies)

01:26.553 --> 01:28.620
(panting)

01:42.102 --> 01:45.270
♪

01:49.509 --> 01:51.710
(horse whinnies)

01:54.881 --> 01:56.782
Come on!

01:57.851 --> 01:59.251
(horse whinnies)

01:59.253 --> 02:00.519
Hyah!

02:04.457 --> 02:07.226
This way, mary, quick.

02:16.436 --> 02:18.504
(panting)

02:20.807 --> 02:23.542
(sighs) we're trapped.
There's no way around.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.710
We have to go back.
The king's guards...

02:24.712 --> 02:26.311
Will intercept us.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.313
We'll never outrun them
in the woods anyway.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.351
We'll be captured and dragged
back to french court.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.253
The king wants England;
he won't give up.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.821
If we're found...

02:35.823 --> 02:37.523
Get down, quickly.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.860
I'm going to get you
back to scotland.
How?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.295
Guard:
This way.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.297
Bash, what are you doing?

02:45.299 --> 02:46.365
Just trust me.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.633
Can you swim?

02:47.635 --> 02:48.901
This is the only way out.

02:48.903 --> 02:50.736
Are you mad?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.804
We'll never survive it.
You can do this.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.706
Stop! In the name of the king!

02:54.708 --> 02:56.475
Seize them!

03:06.953 --> 03:09.254
Guard:
<i>We've checked</i>
<i>every outbound ship</i>

03:09.256 --> 03:10.789
From dunkirk to bayeux,
your majesty.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.691
The scottish queen and your son

03:12.693 --> 03:14.927
Must still be in France, but...
They didn't just disappear.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.930
Bash has many talents, but
magic isn't one of them.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.932
Find them! Go.

03:19.934 --> 03:22.301
Catherine: They've been gone
for more than a week.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.435
You'll never find them.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.570
Francis is back

03:24.572 --> 03:26.371
From his own search.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.273
I tell him it's pointless,
they're long gone,

03:28.275 --> 03:29.808
But he persists.
What did you expect?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.243
Mary's his fiancée.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.444
They were hours from being wed.

03:32.446 --> 03:35.581
Until she rode off
with his brother.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.783
I'd call that engagement off.

03:37.785 --> 03:40.319
What I'd like to know

03:40.321 --> 03:41.720
Is why.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.988
(chuckles)
I hear she was

03:42.990 --> 03:44.690
Probably involved
with him for months.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.858
What is it about her marriage
to our son that strikes

03:46.860 --> 03:48.961
Such fear in
your black heart?

03:48.963 --> 03:50.696
The truth, catherine, for once.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.598
Mary is dangerous

03:52.600 --> 03:55.567
Because she's in danger.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.437
Because the english hate her,
and they always will,

03:58.439 --> 04:01.473
Especially if she lays claim
to their throne as you insist.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.010
I believe
she brings destruction,

04:05.012 --> 04:06.812
Which will reach

04:06.814 --> 04:09.381
Our lands and our hearts.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.951
This isn't your decision,

04:12.953 --> 04:14.486
And if I find out

04:14.488 --> 04:16.655
Her departure is your
doing in any way,

04:16.657 --> 04:18.323
I'll have grounds
to execute you.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.892
I grow weary of your threats.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.761
I grew weary of
you a decade ago.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.963
All I need is cause
to be rid of you.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.431
Perhaps this time,

04:26.433 --> 04:27.799
You've given it to me.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.576
You can't do this.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.378
Take off for days at
a time on your own?

04:39.380 --> 04:40.646
I had guards with me,

04:40.648 --> 04:42.648
Guards that I can trust.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.583
Guards that don't answer to you.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.586
We're only back because
there was a sighting of a girl

04:47.588 --> 04:50.489
Alleged to be mary
in a village nearby.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.392
A girl who appeared
to be barely ten.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.793
(chuckles) well,
few people in France

04:54.795 --> 04:55.994
Have set eyes on mary.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.729
She has money.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.832
She can buy passage
as well as silence.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.368
She has bash to
navigate for them.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.871
You won't find them, and
why would you want to?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.372
Because I want to know
why she left.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.573
Well, didn't you ask her?

05:08.575 --> 05:09.908
She said that
she couldn't trust me

05:09.910 --> 05:11.310
To put her interests
before France.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.745
And she's right.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.516
And I know, because you'll be
an extraordinary king.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.919
She made an excuse.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.021
It's not why she left,
I know it.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.389
Then she's a liar.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.524
Why would you want her?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.059
Because I love her,

05:27.061 --> 05:30.362
Despite everything
that she's done.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.664
And because I sense
your hand in this.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.505
I don't think the innkeeper
believed our story.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.408
That we were attacked
by bandits?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.043
Honest people don't ride
through the woods.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.412
Honest, foolish people do.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.616
Do you think that you're foolish
for helping me?

05:51.618 --> 05:53.418
(sighs) I only meant that
the woods are dangerous.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.053
Not as dangerous as court,
as it turns out.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.556
(shuddering breath)

05:57.558 --> 05:59.758
Do you really think
that queen catherine knew

05:59.760 --> 06:01.593
About your mother's plot
to have you legitimized?

06:01.595 --> 06:04.096
Yes. She used
the information

06:04.098 --> 06:06.565
To blackmail my mother
into leaving court.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.601
My mother never should have done
this behind my father's back.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.870
And behind yours.
You never asked to rule France.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.472
This was never what you wanted.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.474
Try convincing anyone of that.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.709
(grunts)

06:17.711 --> 06:20.612
They're going to think
the worst of us, you know.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.814
I'm sure francis already does.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.852
I'll find
some horses tomorrow.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.453
We'll get a boat from calais

06:28.455 --> 06:29.888
And put this all behind us.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.523
Now, get undressed.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.125
What?

06:33.127 --> 06:34.593
You'll want
dry clothes.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.061
We have a long day
tomorrow.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.665
All right then. Turn around.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.802
For the entire night?

06:45.938 --> 06:47.472
(sighs)

06:47.474 --> 06:49.474
(grunting)

06:49.476 --> 06:51.510
There's not a thing left
in your bag that isn't soaked.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.578
Let it dry.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.849
(grunts)

07:07.927 --> 07:09.861
(footsteps approaching outside)

07:09.863 --> 07:12.097
(knocking)
man:
Innkeeper.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.132
Brought you some
fresh linen.
(whispering): Hide. Quickly.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.501
Our innkeeper lacked grace, but
he wasn't wearing heavy boots.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.440
Well, if it isn't
the bastard son of France.

07:21.442 --> 07:24.443
Those people you paid off
to keep their silence,
we paid them more.

07:24.445 --> 07:27.446
Where's the queen?
I dropped her off in calais.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.981
She's halfway across the channel
in a four-masted galleon.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.617
Without her clothes?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.520
Did they tie her to the
bow like a figurehead?

07:37.190 --> 07:41.126
(grunting)

07:41.128 --> 07:43.128
The king wants you
back alive,

07:43.130 --> 07:44.196
But he said nothing
of your fingers.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.966
Last chance.

07:49.602 --> 07:53.071
Stop! I'm right here.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.739
Unhand him.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.708
This man is under
my protection.
Apologies,

07:56.710 --> 07:59.044
Your grace, but this man is
a french subject, not scottish,

07:59.046 --> 08:00.912
And he's a criminal.
And what crime has he committed

08:00.914 --> 08:02.247
Beyond ensuring my safety?

08:02.249 --> 08:04.149
Weren't you engaged
to his brother?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.152
I suppose that's why I heard the
word "treason" bandied about.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.254
All I know is
the king

08:09.256 --> 08:11.756
Wants his son back at court.

08:12.592 --> 08:14.025
I can help.
No.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.727
I'll explain
why you came with me.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.229
I'll make henry understand.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.763
And francis?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.165
He won't let you leave twice.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.167
I jumped off a cliff with you
and I survived.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.802
This time let me take the lead.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.780
The king wants him taken
to the dungeon.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.015
I'll be fine.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.049
Be strong.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.184
You have to.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.552
Mary!

08:44.757 --> 08:46.758
Is my brother hurt?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.060
Not yet.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.629
They're
locking him up.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.897
And you...

08:51.899 --> 08:53.965
Are you
all right?

08:56.035 --> 08:59.170
I suppose you wondered
if you'd ever see me again.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.039
Yes.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.974
I knew I'd see you.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.010
If I hadn't found you,
if the guards didn't,

09:05.012 --> 09:06.278
I would have come to scotland...

09:06.280 --> 09:08.813
Francis, please, don't.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.248
Nothing has changed.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.684
Everything's changed.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.886
We woke up at sunrise in each
other's arms and I promised

09:14.888 --> 09:16.755
To stand by
you forever,

09:16.757 --> 09:19.791
Against anyone, even my father.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.826
And by sundown,
you'd run off with my brother.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.161
This isn't bash's fault.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.729
No, you say it's about France
bullying you

09:24.731 --> 09:26.164
Into claiming
the throne of England,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.733
Or because my loyalties
might lie to my nation

09:28.735 --> 09:30.735
And not to you.
But I swore myself to you,

09:30.737 --> 09:32.304
And I know you believed me.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.172
Tell me what
happened.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.975
My friend died.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.577
My heart broke.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.579
Why did you leave?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.681
Explain to me

09:42.683 --> 09:46.585
How aylee's death made you
decide you couldn't marry me.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.253
Give me an honest answer.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.689
I deserve that. I was prepared
to give everything to you.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.091
Including your life.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.094
I know that, and I'm sorry.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.663
But I can't marry you.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.166
The king requests

10:01.168 --> 10:03.234
Your presence in
the throne room.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.208
Begging your pardon,
your grace, he just wants

10:10.210 --> 10:12.377
Queen mary.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.821
The guards say
you chose to return.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.725
I am here on
sebastian's behalf.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.159
And to make peace
between our nations,

10:28.161 --> 10:29.928
As it seems
there is some

10:29.930 --> 10:31.363
Ill will in the wake
of my decision

10:31.365 --> 10:34.366
Not to marry
your son francis.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.734
I am hoping you can
help me with this.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.735
Henry:
I'll help you make peace.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.803
Marry francis,
as we'd agreed.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.073
The story for your abrupt
departure is this:

10:42.075 --> 10:44.376
You were a bride
overcome by nerves.
No.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.779
No?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.080
You are here
at your mother's,

10:49.082 --> 10:50.815
At scotland's bidding.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.051
Your wedding is
a treaty of nations.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.052
Women don't
often say no,

10:54.054 --> 10:55.954
To henry.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.156
When they do
he thinks it's a game.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.358
It usually is.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.860
But mary isn't
your usual girl.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.261
She is scotland.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.829
She is its queen.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.432
All right then.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.034
Let's negotiate.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.435
As leaders.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.837
Shall we start with
your desire to protect bash?

11:14.273 --> 11:15.373
You're fond of him,
aren't you?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.442
Aren't you?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.277
He's your son.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.311
He was protecting me.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.746
Bash did nothing wrong.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.114
And you, you shared
a bed with him.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.115
There are witnesses.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.417
They're lying.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.252
But go ahead,
ruin me.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.454
I could give a damn about
my reputation in France.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.455
In scotland?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.791
They will believe
their queen.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.726
A queen with blood on
her hands who let her lover die?

11:34.728 --> 11:37.262
Sebastian ran off

11:37.264 --> 11:39.798
Destroying an alliance
between our countries.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.933
Don't do this.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.134
You want to be
treated like a ruler?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.803
Someone who can say no?

11:44.805 --> 11:45.804
Do you need
lives at stake

11:45.806 --> 11:47.472
To take
this seriously?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.808
Henry, you wouldn't.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.043
You'll marry my son francis
and accept our nation's support,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.212
As you and your new husband,
lay claim to England.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.481
Or I will
execute my son,

11:56.483 --> 11:57.949
My subject bash,

11:57.951 --> 12:00.018
For the treason of
costing me England.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.088
You can watch him bleed to death
on your wedding altar.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.370
Leave us.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.940
Now.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.246
You should never
have come back here.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.848
I had no choice.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.049
Bash was accused
of treason.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.151
I couldn't let him
suffer on his own.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.153
I was afraid something
like this might happen.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.123
Find a way to convince king
henry that I won't back down,

12:38.125 --> 12:39.858
Before he carries
through with his threat.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.292
Killing bash?!

12:41.294 --> 12:42.861
I can't believe
he would do it.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.462
I won't take
that chance.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.064
Well, then lie.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.265
Say that you and bash

12:47.267 --> 12:49.267
Are already married.
How?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.136
You grabbed a priest
on the road.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.271
You said your vows
in a cowshed.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.407
Even henry can't override
a union sanctified by god.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.811
But he can kill bash
in anger on hearing it.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.347
Do you have
any other ideas?

13:03.549 --> 13:04.949
(sighs)

13:04.951 --> 13:06.484
I've sent word
to my mother.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.254
In truth, I cannot believe
that she and her advisors

13:09.256 --> 13:12.390
Would support a claim
on England at this time.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.393
Henry's already been
corresponding with your mother.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.529
Once he learned that
the english queen was dying.

13:20.232 --> 13:21.933
She wants me to do it.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.069
Scotland wants me on
the throne of England.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.237
They know it's a risk...

13:26.239 --> 13:27.806
Less so, with francis
at your side.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.576
They want me to wed the next
king of France without delay.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.415
(sighs) so, there is
no other option.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.150
I must tell francis
of the prophecy.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.852
You must find
another way.

13:43.022 --> 13:46.825
Francis will reject
the prophecy as superstition.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.293
And he will convince you
to marry him.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.295
You know I am right!

13:50.297 --> 13:52.931
I will explain to him why I
believe nostradamus's visions.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.966
Giving him arguments

13:54.968 --> 13:57.168
He can talk you out of
with reason and logic.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.037
And he will.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.872
Because the fact that
nostradamus can see the death

14:00.874 --> 14:02.440
Of the man you love,

14:02.442 --> 14:04.943
Is not something that you
want to believe either.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.178
But I do believe it.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.913
You won't when
he's done with you,

14:08.915 --> 14:10.615
Because francis is
reasonable in all things,

14:10.617 --> 14:13.051
But he is relentless
in his love for you.

14:14.486 --> 14:15.486
If you tell francis,

14:15.488 --> 14:16.988
He will wear you down,

14:16.990 --> 14:18.623
And he is as good as dead.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.991
And if I do nothing,

14:19.993 --> 14:21.459
Bash will die.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.369
(plate clinks)

15:00.199 --> 15:04.035
(water dripping)

15:04.037 --> 15:05.370
You look pathetic...

15:08.007 --> 15:09.307
...But I feel
your hatred.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.244
You don't even have
the decency to feign remorse

15:13.246 --> 15:14.512
For killing that girl.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.152
Clarissa:
I did it to save mary.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.122
You killed aylee
to fulfill my vision.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.024
The queen was
planning to kill her.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.593
So, you've said.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.528
And you're right,

15:30.530 --> 15:32.030
Catherine would have.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.933
Kings and queens do that.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.001
To save another,
to save themselves,

15:37.003 --> 15:39.037
When it suits them,
they play god.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.005
Monsters like you
should not.

15:42.207 --> 15:44.075
Did you not
enjoy your freedom?

15:44.077 --> 15:48.279
You could go about
the castle as you wished.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.950
All I asked, was that
you stay out of sight.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.518
That you harm no one.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.487
So, that no harm
would come to you.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.690
You'll stay here...

16:00.960 --> 16:03.428
...Until I believe you've
learned your lesson.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.668
Do as I say,
or I'll starve you.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.672
(clarissa whimpers)

16:15.641 --> 16:17.709
No.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.580
(door closes)

16:30.122 --> 16:33.024
(panting)

16:53.612 --> 16:55.480
Mary.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.751
Thank you for coming.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.020
Is this about bash?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.688
My father just told me
that he'll kill him

17:03.690 --> 17:05.690
If you don't marry me.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.091
And still you refuse?

17:07.093 --> 17:09.293
Yes.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.294
I'm sorry.

17:10.296 --> 17:11.562
This is insane.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.098
How far will you go
to destroy us?

17:14.100 --> 17:16.167
But it will destroy
you otherwise.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.302
(exhales)
what?

17:18.304 --> 17:20.638
Please, hear me out.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.106
I want to
explain myself.

17:22.108 --> 17:26.244
I want you to understand
why I left you.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.745
It wasn't for
lack of love.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.047
Or joy,

17:29.049 --> 17:32.383
(trembling):
Or trust in you.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.385
It was because I couldn't bear
the thought of losing you.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.587
That makes no sense.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.724
Nostradamus had a vision.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.092
Of your death,

17:41.094 --> 17:43.061
Brought about by me,
if we wed.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.665
You left me
over a prophecy?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.766
One that I believe.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.368
I couldn't take
the risk of being wrong!

17:50.370 --> 17:52.336
This is madness.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.205
I know,
I thought so too.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.107
I didn't believe it,
I didn't want to,

17:56.109 --> 17:58.376
But, I knew that
nostradamus's visions had weight

17:58.378 --> 17:59.811
Even before he
predicted aylee's death.

17:59.813 --> 18:02.080
Her fall?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.514
Hours before it happened.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.483
When the king finds out...

18:05.485 --> 18:06.751
No, you can't tell him!

18:06.753 --> 18:08.586
He will burn
nostradamus alive,

18:08.588 --> 18:10.388
For heresy, or treason,

18:10.390 --> 18:12.356
Both charges apply,
not to mention...

18:14.193 --> 18:15.460
My mother.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.561
She was behind
this as well.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.297
All her crimes against me

18:19.299 --> 18:21.132
Were because
she loves you.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.836
Does she deserve
to burn for that?

18:24.838 --> 18:28.306
She would do anything
for you.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.410
And I would, too.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.612
I will not be
the cause of your death.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.314
And bash?
Shall he die in my stead?

18:36.316 --> 18:37.748
No, of course not.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.517
Because my father
is determined.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.220
You will wed the next
king of France

18:42.222 --> 18:43.588
Or he'll lose
any chance of England.

18:45.390 --> 18:48.392
Mary...

18:48.394 --> 18:52.597
You cannot let
superstition or fear

18:52.599 --> 18:54.165
Rule your life.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.167
You must be the ruler.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.269
Taking charge of
your own destiny.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.640
Marry me.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.909
Now, before my mother
or nostradamus

19:04.911 --> 19:07.678
Can poison you
with fear, pressure you...

19:07.680 --> 19:09.280
You are pressuring me.

19:09.282 --> 19:13.184
And my mother is wrong to
believe in this nonsense!

19:13.186 --> 19:15.686
She was right
to believe.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.155
Aylee is dead.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.823
I believe!

19:18.825 --> 19:19.924
I'll talk to nostradamus.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.392
He'll recant.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.827
I'll make my mother
see things sensibly.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.163
I'll take the risk.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.365
This is my life, my risk.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.403
Once you get past the grief
of aylee's death, you'll see.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.438
Your mother was right,

19:34.440 --> 19:35.840
You are relentless.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.209
When it comes to us, yes.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.478
But I can't do this.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.513
I am begging you, please stop.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.949
I won't.

19:44.951 --> 19:45.950
Ever.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.686
Then I will.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.292
I assume you've asked
for this meeting

19:54.294 --> 19:56.861
Because you've made
your decision.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.596
Will you marry francis?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.731
Or will you be forced
to watch bash's execution?

20:00.733 --> 20:01.966
Neither.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.535
What's this?

20:05.737 --> 20:07.872
I have a third option.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.774
One I think you would
be most interested in.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.609
I will stake
my claim on England

20:11.611 --> 20:13.244
And I will marry your son.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.313
But not francis.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.447
Bash.

20:17.783 --> 20:19.617
Legitimize him and make him

20:19.619 --> 20:21.419
The next king of France.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.626
Explain yourself.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.895
You want England.
I want something in return.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.396
You are talking about

20:32.398 --> 20:34.265
Changing the line of
succession of France.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.334
Bash as king--
this is laughable.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.536
Bastards are being
legitimized all over europe.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.605
I believe the vatican
will favor this arrangement.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.907
How could you know that?
You said yourself,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.875
They want England
as badly as you do.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.611
They will do anything

20:46.613 --> 20:49.380
To keep it from falling into
the hands of the protestants.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.781
You were against
this claim before.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.551
That was before I knew
my mother's wishes.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.254
And how much pressure her
advisors were putting her under.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.023
It seems I will be going off to
England no matter what I think.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.792
But only with
bash at my side.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.694
So I'll make him
a duke, or an earl.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.563
Yes.
Half measures
won't do.

21:05.565 --> 21:09.033
I need to be married to the man
who commands the king's armies.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.402
There'd be
civil unrest.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.603
The nobles
may reject it.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.373
It makes our country
appear unstable.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.808
And I'd have to convince the
pope to annul our marriage.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.011
Are you not acquainted with
my very determined wife?

21:20.013 --> 21:22.346
Perhaps you're wife
will agree.

21:22.348 --> 21:25.683
Because at her core she is
more selfless than you think.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.785
You think she gives a damn about
France controlling England

21:27.787 --> 21:29.387
When she is no longer queen?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.522
It's up to the queen
to decide her priorities.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.391
I've given your majesties
much to consider.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.892
I will take my leave.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.030
(door opens, closes)

21:39.032 --> 21:42.033
You're not seriously
considering this?

21:43.669 --> 21:45.970
What she proposes
would cost me everything.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.838
My marriage, my crown,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.740
The legacy of
our children, your sons.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.742
Yes...

21:51.744 --> 21:53.911
They are all
considerations.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.946
Those bitches!
Who?

21:55.948 --> 21:59.817
Mary, her friends, that parasite
diane, the lot of them.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.986
My mistress diane? What does
she have to do with this?

22:01.988 --> 22:04.588
You don't seriously think that
mary came up with legitimization

22:04.590 --> 22:06.924
All by herself.
Bash must have told her.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.994
Diane has been working on this
behind your back for months.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.662
Do you have proof of this?
Well,

22:11.664 --> 22:12.997
Why don't you ask kenna,
your other mistress.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.599
She told me and as a result,
I blackmailed diane and I

22:15.601 --> 22:18.102
Sent her off to paris.
You admit this deceit?

22:18.104 --> 22:19.837
You would have found out
anyway, from bash,

22:19.839 --> 22:21.872
Before you took
off his head!

22:21.874 --> 22:24.742
I suspect that's the real
reason why he fled the castle.

22:24.744 --> 22:27.078
He was afraid
of your reaction.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.683
So much for the great
love story of mary and bash.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.820
(sighs) but if he left
out of fear,

22:35.822 --> 22:37.021
What was her reason?

22:37.023 --> 22:40.891
I have no idea.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.828
But she certainly made a mess
of things now, hasn't she?

22:46.631 --> 22:49.133
In truth, catherine's been
relatively kind to us.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.135
She was arranging our
passage for next week.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.704
Now you're back
and marrying bash.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.374
If henry makes him
the next king.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.110
It was the only way I could
save bash and francis,

22:59.112 --> 23:02.380
And do as I was bid by
my mother, as is my duty.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.515
What about me?

23:04.517 --> 23:05.549
For bash to become legitimized,

23:05.551 --> 23:06.550
Henry must marry diane

23:06.552 --> 23:07.551
And she'll be back

23:07.553 --> 23:08.652
At court as queen.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.422
If the plan works, yes.

23:11.424 --> 23:12.790
I know this must be
painful for you.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.392
You have feelings
for the king.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.460
Painful?

23:16.462 --> 23:18.796
You have no idea,
any of you!

23:20.665 --> 23:23.033
I think diane
was behind aylee's death.

23:24.102 --> 23:25.936
Kenna, what are you saying?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.806
Aylee fell, but I think
she was poisoned first.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.442
What makes you
think such a thing?

23:31.444 --> 23:33.811
There was a cup shattered
at the base of the stairs.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.746
A cup that was
delivered to me.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.948
I saw a cat drinking
the spilled contents.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.018
Not long after I found
the animal dead in the corner.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.755
Why didn't you tell any of us
about your suspicions?

23:44.757 --> 23:47.992
You were already dealing with
so much and then you were gone.

23:47.994 --> 23:51.629
What could I, any of us,
done about it in your absence?

23:51.631 --> 23:53.030
Who would stand to gain
by my death?

23:53.032 --> 23:54.865
Diane, certainly.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.468
But also catherine.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.003
What better way to warn you
of nostradamus's visions,

23:59.005 --> 24:00.938
Than by fulfilling
his latest prophecy?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.073
That one among us would die?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.775
And one of us did.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.744
There was other proof
of nostradamus's power.

24:06.746 --> 24:09.747
Yes... But it was aylee's
death that convinced you

24:09.749 --> 24:12.616
That what he predicted for
francis would come true.

24:12.618 --> 24:13.984
Did catherine know
of this last prophecy?

24:13.986 --> 24:15.219
Was she aware of it?

24:15.221 --> 24:18.956
She'd never admit to it.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.159
But I'm getting better at
discerning when she's lying.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.862
Catherine:
And I'm not pleased with her.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.964
Did you poison aylee?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.232
Yes or no?

24:28.234 --> 24:31.068
Leave us.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.605
How dare you burst in here after
the stunt you've just pulled.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.475
Give me your answer.

24:37.477 --> 24:40.044
Of course not. I had nothing
but fondness for aylee.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.480
And kenna?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.715
A cup was delivered to her
bedside that ended up in

24:44.717 --> 24:46.016
Aylee's hands.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.519
(gasping)

24:48.521 --> 24:50.020
(bell tolls in distance)

24:50.022 --> 24:52.790
Your friend kenna,
she came to me,

24:52.792 --> 24:55.759
She'd found out about diane's
plot to have bash legitimized.

24:55.761 --> 25:00.064
Bash told me, but I wasn't
aware that kenna knew.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.200
I saw an opportunity
to get rid of them both.

25:03.202 --> 25:07.905
I told diane about
kenna's scheming and I...

25:07.907 --> 25:09.139
Gifted her some poison.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.208
I suppose I was testing her,

25:11.210 --> 25:13.511
To see if she'd actually
try to poison kenna

25:13.513 --> 25:15.613
Before leaving the castle.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.748
And clearly, she tried.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.216
So, it was your poison.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.784
Delivered at diane's
hands and not yours.

25:20.786 --> 25:25.089
Delivered to the wrong girl.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.524
You must believe me.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.792
Why would I tell
you this otherwise?

25:28.794 --> 25:31.629
What reason would I have
to kill aylee?

25:31.631 --> 25:34.532
To make me believe
nostradamus's prophecies.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.534
He had a vision
of one of my ladies dying.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.069
He never told me.

25:39.071 --> 25:42.172
He takes no comfort
in the horrors he sees.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.909
And he knows that I would
probably have killed

25:44.911 --> 25:47.111
One of your ladies
trying to convince you.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.179
I'm telling you the truth.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.249
On my immortal soul.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.952
There's still time
to fix this.

25:54.954 --> 25:55.953
Leave for scotland.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.655
I have connections,

25:57.657 --> 25:59.690
I can ensure you find
another suitable match.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.992
Not in time.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.827
No, this can't
be happening.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.297
You end up with a king,

26:06.299 --> 26:08.666
And three kingdoms
under your rule,

26:08.668 --> 26:10.568
And I lose everything?!

26:10.570 --> 26:14.638
I am losing the man that
I love. I am saving your son!

26:14.640 --> 26:16.807
I have made my sacrifice!

26:16.809 --> 26:18.943
And now it is your turn.

26:18.945 --> 26:22.246
I must talk to francis and tell
him of my proposal to wed bash

26:22.248 --> 26:23.948
Before somebody else does.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.816
I might have
already mentioned it.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.786
♪ I'll be the first...

26:28.788 --> 26:29.987
Francis? (panting)

26:29.989 --> 26:32.723
♪

26:32.725 --> 26:35.793
♪ I'll be the third
and the fourth ♪

26:35.795 --> 26:37.962

26:37.964 --> 26:39.263

sent me here to find you ♪

26:39.265 --> 26:41.098

26:44.036 --> 26:45.936
(grunting)

26:47.305 --> 26:49.139
(panting)
get up.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.341
I can explain.

26:50.343 --> 26:51.775
(grunts)

26:51.777 --> 26:53.010
Why did you steal mary?!

26:53.012 --> 26:56.680
(grunts) I was trying
to help her.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.816
You took advantage of her fears,
and this family's trust.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.050
Mary:
Francis, stop.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.619
Francis:
How long have you hated me?

27:01.621 --> 27:02.953
I was trying to
save your life.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.221
Stop!

27:04.223 --> 27:05.756
Stop! Francis, stop!

27:05.758 --> 27:08.125
Stop! This isn't
bash's fault!

27:08.127 --> 27:09.860
He only knew
about the prophecy.

27:09.862 --> 27:13.631
The only thing we've done
is try to save you.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.166
I'm the one who
proposed marrying him.

27:16.168 --> 27:19.303
I proposed that he be
the new heir to the throne.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.305
You proposed what?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.373
I'm sorry.

27:23.975 --> 27:27.911
You are setting
the course of nations.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.048
Asking the pope to say
that this is god's will!

27:31.050 --> 27:34.785
Taking my family's
inheritance,

27:34.787 --> 27:37.655
From me, my mother,
my brothers.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.924
And I'm supposed
to accept this.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.860
You are throwing away

27:42.862 --> 27:45.295
Everything we had
for superstition!

27:45.297 --> 27:47.431
Nostradamus
knows nothing.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.067
You know that
I love you.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.069
If you think that,
because in your minds,

27:52.071 --> 27:53.671
You're saving me,

27:53.673 --> 27:56.206
That I will forgive you
for this, you're wrong.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.076
(crying)

27:59.078 --> 28:02.079
(groaning)

28:02.081 --> 28:04.014
Are you all right?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.350
When were you
planning to tell me?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.352
Before or after
my coronation?!

28:08.354 --> 28:09.720
(sighs)

28:09.722 --> 28:11.155
Please don't be angry.

28:11.157 --> 28:14.258
I never wanted
my brother's crown.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.693
No matter
my mother's plans.

28:15.695 --> 28:18.162
But will you take it,
to save his life?

28:18.164 --> 28:21.899
Can I have more than
a heartbeat to think about it?!

28:32.277 --> 28:35.179
Why didn't you tell me about
your visions of mary's friends?

28:35.181 --> 28:37.314
If I had, you've had
killed one of them, no?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.783
To make mary believe?

28:39.785 --> 28:42.786
Well, that was my point
to mary, exactly.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.422
It's tragic, about aylee.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.425
At least her death
will do some good,

28:48.427 --> 28:49.927
If it saves francis.

28:51.329 --> 28:54.898
But now mary is so
convinced of your power,

28:54.900 --> 28:57.000
That she's ready to upset
the line of succession.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.903
In mary's mind,
this is the only way.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.039
Well, of course
there are others.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.841
Options to keep you in power.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.910
Without power,
I am vulnerable.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.479
And so are my children.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.047
When henry dies,

29:10.049 --> 29:11.448
And bash becomes king,

29:11.450 --> 29:13.484
My sons become targets.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.786
They'll threaten
sebastian's rule,

29:15.788 --> 29:17.488
As some will say
they belong on the throne,

29:17.490 --> 29:20.124
One by one,
in rightful succession.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.126
No, mary's plan
will not do.

29:22.128 --> 29:26.497
She and bash must be stopped in
a manner that leaves no trace.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.899
Is there no other way?

29:28.901 --> 29:30.033
Can you suggest one?

29:33.838 --> 29:35.539
Hire a scribe,
leave a note in mary's hand,

29:35.541 --> 29:37.808
A good-bye to her friends,

29:37.810 --> 29:41.111
She would do that if she and
bash were making an escape.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.781
Find a jailer who'll say
that she bribed him.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.149
Pay him well,

29:45.151 --> 29:46.917
And then kill him, too.

29:46.919 --> 29:50.320
Take all the bodies to the
forest and bury them deep...

29:50.322 --> 29:53.924
So that when the rains come
and the animals dig...

29:53.926 --> 29:55.793
Their skulls are not found.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.592
(door squeaks open)

30:35.033 --> 30:37.501
Henry:
Ah, mary, you're safe.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.570
No one followed you,

30:39.572 --> 30:42.439
Or knows
you're here,

30:42.441 --> 30:44.374
Not even
your ladies?

30:44.376 --> 30:47.244
No, no one knows.

30:47.246 --> 30:51.582
You've taught me
something, mary.

30:51.584 --> 30:55.285
God has a
sense of humor.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.187
When I heard
the vatican's support

30:57.189 --> 30:59.122
Of your claim to the english
throne, I thought,

30:59.124 --> 31:02.559
"a chance this perfect
must be crafted by god."

31:02.561 --> 31:06.129
But now, I see god's mocking me.

31:06.131 --> 31:09.533
I mean, how else do you
explain that on the verge of

31:09.535 --> 31:12.135
Uniting England,
scotland and France,

31:12.137 --> 31:16.440
I'd be here held hostage by
the whims of a teenaged girl?

31:16.442 --> 31:19.009
It's not a whim.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.144
I am deadly serious.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.447
You were never
groomed to be king.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.282
Your recent actions
have shown me

31:25.284 --> 31:28.585
That you are not prepared
for power.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.487
And yet, here we are.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.492
I'll agree to your terms.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.464
Let god mock the english
for a change.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.299
Hmm?
Thank you.

31:42.301 --> 31:45.068
You're serious?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.437
Your ascent to the throne
will not be official

31:47.439 --> 31:49.573
Until the pope agrees,

31:49.575 --> 31:51.275
Which will
not be easy.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.077
I'll go to rome,
and do my best.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.181
I've been

31:58.183 --> 32:00.183
A better father
to you than francis,

32:00.185 --> 32:02.920
But he's my son, too,
and your brother.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.221
You have betrayed him.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.023
I don't know why,

32:06.025 --> 32:08.058
I don't know if it's love
or something else, but

32:08.060 --> 32:10.527
This will destroy
him, unless he's

32:10.529 --> 32:12.496
A stronger man
than either of us knew.

32:12.498 --> 32:15.032
In which case,

32:15.034 --> 32:17.701
God have mercy on you.

32:23.007 --> 32:24.474
To the future king

32:24.476 --> 32:26.677
And queen of France,

32:26.679 --> 32:29.413
Scotland
and England.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.550
There is one
other thing.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.018
What will we do
about catherine?

32:35.020 --> 32:36.253
She won't give up

32:36.255 --> 32:38.622
Her crown easily.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.558
I can handle my wife.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.963
(gasping)

32:47.365 --> 32:50.167
(gasping)

32:51.669 --> 32:54.204
You're next.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.605
(gasps)
no.

32:58.576 --> 33:01.178
(whimpering)

33:03.448 --> 33:06.650
It's best
if you remain standing.

33:08.052 --> 33:11.355
Are you going
to execute me yourself?

33:11.357 --> 33:14.458
I'm trying very hard not to kill
you for the things you've done.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.627
You've had me followed?
I know how you behave
when you're cornered.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.997
I will never agree
to an annulment,

33:19.999 --> 33:22.332
No matter what fabrications
you concoct to get you England.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.134
I want all agreed to this plan.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.003
When I die,

33:26.005 --> 33:27.404
Bash will be king.

33:27.406 --> 33:30.207
If he is survived by our
children, the line of succession

33:30.209 --> 33:31.541
Will revert
to my sons by you.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.610
Ah, well, it's
better than I hoped.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.780
Especially as you're instantly
planning bash's demise.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.382
He would have been next,

33:38.384 --> 33:40.417
After you sent an assassin

33:40.419 --> 33:42.552
To mary's chambers
this very evening.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.788
Now you think you'll simply pick
bash off, once my guard is down,

33:44.790 --> 33:46.790
Or before they pop out an heir,

33:46.792 --> 33:49.693
And the throne will revert
to francis.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.529
Aren't you ahead of me?
It's as if we had one mind.
Mary: Catherine,

33:52.531 --> 33:54.297
Don't. He's thought
of every angle.

33:54.299 --> 33:55.665
Henry:
Mary's right.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.534
Because I know your next plan
is to kill me.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.569
To remove the largest obstacle

33:59.571 --> 34:01.371
And hasten things along.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.507
A stray arrow,
a hunting accident.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.510
I wouldn't dare.
Francis:
Yes, you would.

34:06.512 --> 34:10.313
You'd kill everyone in this
room to get me on the throne.

34:10.315 --> 34:13.750
To protect me, in the hope
that I would then protect you.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.586
But my first order of business,
as king, would be to execute you

34:16.588 --> 34:18.655
If you were
to harm anyone here.

34:18.657 --> 34:23.360
My brother, my
father, mary.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.563
This has to stop.

34:32.336 --> 34:34.204
I see a future

34:34.206 --> 34:36.473
For us quite clearly.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.075
We would be happy.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.110
I would give anything
to spend my life,

34:40.112 --> 34:41.778
However long, at your side.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.513
I know you would.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.549
But you see a future without me,
and that's the one

34:45.551 --> 34:47.150
You choose.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.418
You know why
it's the only choice.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.487
It's your choice.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.489
You are

34:52.491 --> 34:54.825
So headstrong,

34:54.827 --> 34:58.829
So... So strong.

35:01.566 --> 35:04.234
And you, my brother--

35:04.236 --> 35:07.671
I envied you
for so long,

35:07.673 --> 35:10.841
And look at us now.

35:10.843 --> 35:14.244
You have what's mine,
and I have your freedom.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.580
Well, I...

35:16.582 --> 35:19.816
I plan
to take full advantage of it.

35:28.159 --> 35:29.893
Long may you reign.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.311
Your grace,
her majesty the queen.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.248
Wait. Stay.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.750
And you, as well.
Close the door.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.621
You're arming yourself
against me.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.157
Am I really that frightening?

36:00.159 --> 36:03.293
Am I really stupid enough
to find out?

36:03.295 --> 36:04.694
What do you want?

36:04.696 --> 36:06.396
You must be very
pleased with yourself.

36:06.398 --> 36:09.199
I take no joy
in what this has cost you.

36:09.201 --> 36:13.703
My life... Not just my crown.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.706
The annulment won't be enough
for henry.

To quiet the issues, the
questions about his judgment,

36:19.745 --> 36:21.845
It's best
if I'm gone.

36:21.847 --> 36:25.615
He will find some excuse
to behead me.

36:25.617 --> 36:28.185
Then leave France, disappear,
and never return.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.620
If only you had taken
this advice.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.223
I believe that king henry
will let you live

36:33.225 --> 36:35.192
If he gets what he wants.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.861
Grant him the annulment,
and then go far from here

36:37.863 --> 36:40.363
And grant yourself a happy life.

36:40.365 --> 36:45.235
Oh, mary, don't you know by now?
