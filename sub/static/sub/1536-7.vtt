WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.764
Previously
on Grimm...

00:02.840 --> 00:04.126
Nick can't see us
anymore.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.406
He's not a Grimm anymore.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.926
We found a way for you
to get your Grimm back.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.000
A Grimm?

00:17.040 --> 00:18.963
Yeah, lam.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.684
You want to tell me
who has my granddaughter.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.649
Kelly Burkhardt.
Nick's mother.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.006
You know
I'm going to find her.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.445
Shaw is bad news.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.249
When he heard that Nick's
not a Grimm anymore,

00:27.320 --> 00:29.721
he started tellin' everybody that
he was gonna teach him a lesson.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.524
If any of your other
friends get the same idea,

00:31.600 --> 00:32.761
they won't be
as lucky as you.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.729
- What is it?
- A Wolfsangel.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.928
The Secundum
Naturae Ordinem Wesen.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.447
To them, intermarriage is a
crime against man and nature.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.123
Oh, my God! Trubel?
Josh?

00:43.200 --> 00:45.089
Josh. You know
how to use that thing?

00:45.160 --> 00:46.207
Not a clue.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.247
"I have but to swallow this,
and be for the rest of my days

00:55.320 --> 00:58.642
persecuted by a legion of
goblins, all of my own creation.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.326
Humbug, I tell you; humbug!"

01:13.160 --> 01:14.161
Ah.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.163
There you are. Come with me, dear.
Or what?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.401
Under the mistletoe,
if you will.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.527
Yes. I did put
that there.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.766
Watch out behind you.
Excuse me.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.808
Some people
are so rude, you know?

01:21.920 --> 01:22.921
You having fun?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.889
Somebody
get the door.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.327
Hey, Dennis, somebody dropped
off a present for you.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.528
Just put it
under the tree.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.330
Hey, Rick, you wanna give
me a hand with this?

01:39.400 --> 01:40.970
Yeah, sure. Oh.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.484
Got a little
weight to it.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.970
Mmm.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.208
Somebody's been
good, huh?

02:05.720 --> 02:06.767
You ready?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.526
Yeah!

02:17.360 --> 02:19.124
Whoo-hoo!

02:19.400 --> 02:20.401
Yeah!

02:22.000 --> 02:23.729
Oh, it's so great!

02:24.720 --> 02:26.768
Oh, my God!

02:27.400 --> 02:30.085
This is so fun! I love it.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.286
Hey, look, there's something
on that train car.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.521
You should grab it.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.081
What's this?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.924
I don't know,
better open it.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.964
Looks like an invitation to a
Christmas party. Are we going?

02:50.040 --> 02:51.041
It's up to you.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.326
Depends on
who's throwing it.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.208
"Dearest Rosalee." Hmm.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.765
Looks like this one's
just for me.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.569
Well,
guess I'm out of luck.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.769
"You are invited to join your
husband, dearest Monroe,

03:03.840 --> 03:07.811
"next week on
an oft-delayed honeymoon.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.325
"He's hoping
you'll say yes,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.926
"because it won't be much of
a honeymoon without you."

03:13.400 --> 03:14.447
We can really go?

03:14.520 --> 03:15.646
H” You say yes.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.131
Oh, yes!

03:22.120 --> 03:23.360
That better not be an...

03:23.440 --> 03:24.726
That was not an omen.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.202
Right. Of course.
No omens here.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.681
We're gonna be okay.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.762
We're gonna be
just fine.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.086
Dennis, wake up.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.128
I think I heard
something downstairs.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.564
Dennis!

04:08.680 --> 04:11.047
There is somebody downstairs!

04:11.120 --> 04:12.849
I told you.
Call the police.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.365
What the hell?

04:33.520 --> 04:34.567
Oh, my God.

04:36.760 --> 04:37.761
Help!

04:37.880 --> 04:38.881
Dennis!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.206
Emma!

05:11.200 --> 05:14.329
This is the group that's been
terrorizing Monroe and Rosalee.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.607
Secundum Naturae
Ordinem Wesen?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.648
That's what Rosalee
said it might be.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.121
Aren't those the puss-heads that
burned a Wolfsangel on their lawn?

05:23.200 --> 05:24.247
Yeah, it could be.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.087
"1252, Lyon.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.482
"I first encountered the
Secundum Naturae Ordinem Wesen,

05:30.600 --> 05:32.489
"Also known
as the Wesenrein,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.524
"during a trial conducted
by the Catholic Inquisition.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.968
"Not only were they searching out
heretics and burning them at the stake,

05:39.040 --> 05:41.964
"but some of the inquisitors
I discovered were Wesen

05:42.040 --> 05:44.327
"and using their positions
to root out

05:44.400 --> 05:46.562
"impurity within
the Wesen Society.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.689
"The Wesen heretics, or as
they were known, the Impuro,

05:49.760 --> 05:53.321
"were tried outside the
cities by secret tribunals.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.811
"These brutal trials
dragged on

05:54.880 --> 05:58.327
"from one to three days,
bereft of mercy."

05:58.400 --> 06:00.368
Nice masks.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.249
"They too were burned,
not necessarily

06:02.320 --> 06:05.244
"so much at the stake
as through the stake."

06:06.520 --> 06:08.602
Ah, an artistic rendering.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.725
"Seeing that the tribunals
were doing my work for me,

06:12.800 --> 06:16.600
"I took a much-needed sabbatical
on the Isle of Crete."

06:16.680 --> 06:19.081
I guess the Inquisition made
life easier for the Grimms.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.606
Yeah, it seems like
the Wesenrein

06:21.680 --> 06:23.170
didn't die out
with the Inquisition.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.891
They know Monroe
and Rosalee were married.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.883
It's not like
they took out an ad.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.200
Well, it looks like
somebody at the wedding

06:29.280 --> 06:31.601
told somebody,
who told somebody.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.810
Unbelievable.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.086
Unbelievable that this
is now believable.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.731
When my dad first
showed me stuff like this,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.564
I thought they were some kind
of fantasies he'd been having.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.880
So, you really didn't know
your dad was a Grimm

06:45.960 --> 06:46.961
when you were growing up?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.088
He tried to tell me about some
of this when I got older,

06:49.160 --> 06:53.051
but I'm not,
you know, what he was.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.327
What Nick is again,
what Trubel is.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.607
I just thought my
dad was kind of crazy,

06:57.680 --> 06:59.887
and getting crazier.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.247
If you really thought he was crazy,
Why'd you bring him to Nick?

07:02.320 --> 07:03.401
He was dying.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.721
This is the only thing he
wanted to do before he died.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.088
At that point, you don't
care if he's crazy or not.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.170
Then I met you guys, and I
realized crazy is relative.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.369
How do you
deal with it?

07:17.880 --> 07:20.486
Well, you know,
the way I look at it,

07:20.560 --> 07:21.846
everyone has problems.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.646
Some are worse than others,
and some are monsters.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.246
Not all of them,
but a lot of them.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.971
And those are the ones
that Nick has to deal with.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.362
You know, sometimes I actually find
myself wishing I could be like Nick.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.682
Maybe that's a dumb
thing to wish for.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.561
One day, you might not
have a choice.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.405
I know.
That scares me, too.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.602
What about what's been happening
to Monroe and Rosalee?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.011
Are those threats real?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.321
Nick's taking it
very seriously.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.402
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.049
You have enough problems
of your own right now.

07:59.120 --> 08:03.489
Well, if you count having
no job, no house, no oar,

08:03.560 --> 08:06.040
and two Hundjagers
trying to kill you,

08:06.120 --> 08:08.726
then yeah,
I guess I do.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.649
You know, it's gonna be the first
Christmas in my whole life

08:16.720 --> 08:19.121
that I won't be spending
in Philadelphia.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.331
I'm sorry.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.691
Sorry if I interrupted
any holiday festivities.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.171
Wasn't sure if this was
gang-related or not,

08:30.280 --> 08:31.691
but it's definitely
home invasion.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.081
The question is,
what invaded?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.201
Who got hurt?

08:35.280 --> 08:38.010
Dennis Gladstone, the owner of the house.
Got banged up pretty good.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.246
Paramedics took him in.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.684
His wife stayed
behind to talk to us,

08:40.760 --> 08:42.443
but she's anxious
to get to the hospital.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
Any witnesses?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.250
Mr. Gladstone's
the only eyewitness,

08:45.320 --> 08:47.322
but neighbors said they heard
a lot of strange noises.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.687
Of course,
strange is your specialty.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.688
No visible signs
of forced entry.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.525
Locks weren't tampered
with, no windows broken.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.929
So much debris and wreckage, gonna
be a challenge to dust for prints.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.483
Mrs. Gladstone, this is
Detective Burkhardt

09:09.760 --> 09:11.728
and Detective Griffin.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.847
Thank you.
Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.285
I can't believe
this happened.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.571
I really wanna see
my husband.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.610
We understand. We just need
to ask a few questions.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.765
Did you witness
the attack?

09:23.840 --> 09:27.049
No, but I heard it.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.600
It was horrible.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.650
When I got downstairs,
whoever did this was gone.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.368
I found Dennis
on the floor.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.408
Did anything happen
before the attack?

09:38.840 --> 09:43.767
We, uh, had a party
with a lot of our friends.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.968
Went to about 11:00.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.605
Then everyone left. We
locked up and went to bed.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.366
Did you notice anything unusual,
anyone around the house?

09:54.960 --> 09:57.725
No. Not really.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.603
We had a late-night delivery,
but that's about it.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.727
What delivery?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.564
I'm not sure, really.
Uh...

10:03.640 --> 10:06.246
There was a present
left on the front doorstep.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.402
I didn't see it till a couple
of the guests brought it in.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.960
Do you know which one it was?
Um...

10:11.040 --> 10:12.371
That one.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.129
How much longer? I really
need to get to the hospital.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.248
Do you have any idea
who sent the present?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.448
No, I wasn't
paying attention.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.931
Check this out.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.168
Looks like somebody ripped
this open from the inside.

10:28.240 --> 10:33.167
It's like someone or something
pushed itself out of the box.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.521
So they brought the package
inside, put it under the tree.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.801
Party ends,
they go to bed.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.928
Later,
they hear something.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.369
Mr. Gladstone comes downstairs,
interrupts what's going on.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.568
Hell, tries to run,
was attacked.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.521
Looks like someone
had time for a snack.

10:49.600 --> 10:53.241
Well, you can work up an
appetite beating somebody up.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.490
That looks
like fruitcake.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.766
Hmm.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.321
Didn't think
anyone ate those.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.450
Where you going?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.047
Go back to sleep.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.366
Oh, yeah,
like I could now.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.601
I gotta go do something.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.841
This early?
Josh“.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.604
Whatever it is, I think
I should go with you.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.250
What? Why?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.130
Look, you said
I gotta get over this.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.886
My fear of,
you know, everything.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.203
But, look, I'm not gonna get over
anything by just laying on the couch.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.406
It's not a good idea.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.926
I gotta learn.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.280
Isn't that what
Nick did for you?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.809
But I'm a Grimm,
and so is Nick.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.281
Okay, Juliette isn't
and Hank isn't.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.601
Okay, but things get a little
iffy, so don't get in my way.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.366
Hey, yeah, I'll be standing
right behind you.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.241
What are we doing?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.367
Gotta check
on a guy.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.442
Is he Wesen?
Yeah.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.931
Why you gotta check
on him?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.081
'Cause he might be
involved in something.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.161
What?

12:16.280 --> 12:19.090
Stuff going on with Rosalee
and Monroe. Uh-huh.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.321
Okay, what do you
need me to do?

12:20.400 --> 12:21.970
Just stay here.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.964
...which goes against
every code we've got,

12:36.040 --> 12:37.690
everything we've ever
been taught,

12:37.760 --> 12:40.445
everything we've been raised
with our entire lives.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.603
All right? It's not bad
enough we got that cop Grimm,

12:43.680 --> 12:46.251
now there's some
woman Grimm.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.926
That little Bud, that
little weasel's out there,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.490
on their side!

12:50.560 --> 12:52.767
So he's got to be
dealt with,

12:52.840 --> 12:55.047
this new Grimm woman's
got to be dealt with...

13:06.720 --> 13:07.801
I agree...

13:29.240 --> 13:30.685
He Woged, right?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.205
Tell me he Woged.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.850
Yeah, a Schakal, I think.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.325
Wait, he's got
something here.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.731
What's that?

13:39.240 --> 13:40.685
We should go.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.161
You guys
are up early.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.288
You go for a walk?

13:49.360 --> 13:50.691
More like a run.

13:50.760 --> 13:51.807
Is there a problem?

13:55.520 --> 13:56.521
What is this?

13:56.600 --> 13:57.931
Uh, you remember
when Bud came by

13:58.000 --> 14:00.162
and asked me to help with
that bully problem at school?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.767
Well, it was really about
this guy Shaw, a Klaustreich

14:03.840 --> 14:04.966
who was gonna do
something to you

14:05.040 --> 14:06.760
'cause he heard you weren't
a Grimm anymore.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.205
And Bud thought
you should help with this.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.327
Yeah.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.601
Bud thought that Shaw
found out from a guy

14:14.680 --> 14:16.330
who was at Monroe
and Rosalee's wedding.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.084
Which is what we were talking
about in the trailer, right?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.207
This threat against them.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.640
So, I thought that Shaw
must have heard

14:21.680 --> 14:23.887
about a Blutbad
marrying a Fuchsbau.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.485
So I went over there to see
what I could find out,

14:25.560 --> 14:27.608
and I sure didn't think
it was gonna be that.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.688
The mask was in the
coat of a Schakal

14:29.760 --> 14:31.046
Josh hit in the head
with a rock.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.849
You hit a Schakal
with a rock?

14:32.920 --> 14:35.207
Well, he was coming up
behind Trubel and I just...

14:35.280 --> 14:37.044
You got away?
Nobody saw you?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.201
Nope.
No.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.489
Well, I think we need to find out
more about Shaw and his friends.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.204
Well, Bud knows this guy Shaw.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.487
He might know more
about his friends, too.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.529
Can you swing by?
Witness is ready to talk.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.040
Yeah, I can meet you
at the hospital.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.526
See what you can
find out from Bud.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.568
But just get the names.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.165
They were obviously
kids or something,

15:01.240 --> 15:02.730
dressed up like red,
hairy monsters.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.167
Jumped me before I
could even react.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.446
How many were there?

15:06.520 --> 15:10.127
Three, I think. I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.806
Do you have details as to
what they looked like?

15:12.880 --> 15:15.804
What are you gonna do? Put out a
police sketch of hairy little beasts?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.051
Aren't you looking for whoever
was inside the costumes?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.726
Any detail about the costume
could help track them down.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.531
Green eyes,
yellow teeth, pointed ears.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.888
They smelled like
a boys' locker room.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.406
Big guy on our left
is Big Johnson.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.481
Big Johnson?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.080
Real name, Harold.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.163
He is one badass Schakal.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.440
I think that's the guy Josh
hit in the head with a rock.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.689
You hit Big Johnson?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.364
How do you spell "Schakal"?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.768
Uh, S... Sha...

15:49.840 --> 15:51.444
Just like it sounds.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.000
I recognize
the other guy.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.530
I think he was at
the meeting, too.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.120
That's Walter Dempsey.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.201
What's he?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.961
A Hasslich. I hate them.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.041
Not that I'm prejudiced.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.202
Well, actually I am.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.124
They've picked on
Eisbibers for generations.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.565
Don't get me started.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.529
I think this is
getting serious.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.320
There's gonna be
real live ballerinas,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.448
and fairies
and dancing candy,

16:26.520 --> 16:28.648
and a nutcracker
that comes to life.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.688
Honey, you're not going to
believe all the amazing things

16:30.800 --> 16:32.723
you're gonna see tonight.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.531
First crime scene
was on Shaver Street,

16:42.600 --> 16:44.329
here.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.922
Second crime scene
on Highland,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.729
here.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.326
Most recent one
on Bryce,

16:52.400 --> 16:55.051
right about here.

16:55.120 --> 16:59.808
Now, that puts the center of
everything right about here.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.450
No reports
of vehicles involved.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.521
Maybe they're moving
on foot.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.806
Three nights in a row.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.530
Let's start looking
in this area.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.284
See, now what's that
in the middle?

17:08.480 --> 17:12.007
"St. Demetrios
Greek Orthodox Church."

17:13.359 --> 17:14.599
I'm taking this one
with us.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.728
Hey, Nick.
Can I see you for a minute?

17:16.800 --> 17:17.925
Sure.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.204
Uh, just got this
from the sketch artist.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.044
Based on
the witness' description,

17:27.119 --> 17:29.441
this is what
we're looking for.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.771
How do you want me
to handle this?

17:31.840 --> 17:33.968
I'd say very carefully.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.490
My mother left.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.723
Sorry I didn't have a
chance to say thank you.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.564
Maybe you still can.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.005
She now knows she has
a granddaughter,

17:46.080 --> 17:47.491
and she's on a quest
to find her.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.403
You tell her who has her?
Of course.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.881
I had to. She's my mother.
She just saved my life

17:51.960 --> 17:54.247
and, in a roundabout way,
she just saved yours, too.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.804
Your mother wants to know
where mine is.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.850
Yeah, she brought up
that subject.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.767
Have you heard from her?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.721
Well, even if I had, she
wouldn't tell me where she was.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.610
And just in case you're
wondering, I haven't.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.370
My mother's very determined, Nick,
and she's quite resourceful.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.841
Now, my desire here is
simply to protect my child,

18:13.920 --> 18:16.924
and I don't want my mother
to kill your mother.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.923
And I don't want my mother
to kill your mother.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.810
Well, if we can't warn yours
and we can't dissuade mine,

18:21.880 --> 18:24.690
then we're gonna have to figure out
another way to deal with all this.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.485
It was your mother
who helped Adalind

18:27.560 --> 18:29.483
and the baby
escape the Royals.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.971
Now, with Adalind
back in Vienna,

18:31.040 --> 18:33.486
it's not gonna take them long to
figure out who has the child.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.164
It's not going to make it
any easier to find them.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.287
Let's hope not.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.280
Have you given any thought to how
you wanna handle Sergeant Wu?

18:41.960 --> 18:43.803
He found one of my books
in Trubel's room.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.086
He thinks she knows
what they are.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.844
He wants to know why you seem
to be protecting a suspect.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.491
If he hadn't found that book, he
wouldn't be paying any attention to her.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.803
Well, he did find that book and he is
paying attention to her, and to you.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.006
What do you want me to do?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.082
Right now, I don't want him
discovering anything about me.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.770
Yeah?

18:58.920 --> 18:59.967
Fourth night
is the charm.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.805
911 call just came in.
We got one in progress.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.927
Go.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.486
What the hell
are they?

19:25.600 --> 19:26.931
No idea.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.331
There's one on the roof.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.405
Easy.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.051
Easy.
Now take it easy, pal.

20:13.760 --> 20:14.761
You can see this, too?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.763
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
there's no hiding that one.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.881
Guess you don't need to be
a Grimm to see it.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.121
Is it Wesen?

20:21.240 --> 20:22.685
I don't know
if it's Woged or what.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.520
Well, if it's not Wesen,
what the hell is it?

20:25.160 --> 20:26.969
We sure as hell can't take
it back to the precinct.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.200
Oh, we're not
leaving it here.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.720
Well, we better take it somewhere
before somebody sees it.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.962
Okay, we'll take it
to Monroe and Rosalee's.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.724
They can help us
figure out what it is.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.681
Ugh.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.320
That guy wasn't lying
about the smell.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.250
I'm going to call Juliette. We're
gonna need a big dog crate.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.129
And animal sedatives.

20:45.880 --> 20:49.362
Now we don't know what
this thing is, so be careful.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.646
Ready?

20:59.960 --> 21:00.961
Mmm.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.405
Ugh.
I think it's out.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.160
Still want me to use this?
Are you kidding?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.531
- Yes!
- Yeah, please.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.328
So, you ever seen
one of these before?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.004
That would be
a definite uh-uh.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.611
Me neither.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.166
Ooh!
That smells like a...

21:14.240 --> 21:16.846
Like a pungent,
vinegarish,

21:18.160 --> 21:21.130
glandular,
musky kind of a...

21:21.200 --> 21:22.611
Yeah, chamber pot.

21:22.680 --> 21:23.880
Let's get him
inside the crate.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.120
You can't open it
from the inside, can you?

21:26.200 --> 21:27.201
No.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.964
We got an hour, hour and a
half before it wakes up.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.201
Not much longer.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.685
Why don't you get it
into the garage,

21:33.760 --> 21:35.489
and then Juliette
and I will monitor

21:35.560 --> 21:37.130
while you guys
check out the trailer?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.201
Wait a minute, are you
gonna be all right?

21:39.720 --> 21:41.404
I'll be all right.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.129
Something about
four-feet tall,

21:50.200 --> 21:54.250
hairy, smelly,
and hates Christmas.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.325
That narrows it down,
sort of.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.607
And I can tell you from
the odoriferous evidence,

21:58.680 --> 22:02.651
it is not upine, canine,
feline, vulpine, or bovine.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.131
I think
I got something.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.611
In Greek.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.802
We're talkin'
Mediterranean?

22:07.880 --> 22:10.247
Oh, I think so.
Take a look at this.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.408
- Yeah, looks like them.
- Huh.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.921
Well, I hope
it's been translated.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.809
Yeah, a few times.

22:18.920 --> 22:23.642
Uh, French, Russian, German.
Whoa!

22:25.040 --> 22:26.087
English.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.841
"Kallikantzaroi."

22:31.920 --> 22:33.729
That's the English?

22:33.800 --> 22:35.564
That's, I think,
what they're called.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.371
"December, 1730.
I arrived in Dresden

22:38.440 --> 22:41.205
"at the order of King Augustus
the Second the Strong.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.408
"Having been successful
at tracking down

22:43.480 --> 22:46.051
"and dispatching
Kallikantzaroi..."

22:46.120 --> 22:48.327
Rai? Roi?

22:48.400 --> 22:49.481
I don't know.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.369
"...in the Greek Isles
the year before,

22:51.440 --> 22:53.522
"I suddenly found
myself in much demand.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.089
"But my discovery of what they
were was not without its pitfalls.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.764
"Before my time,
it was assumed

22:59.840 --> 23:02.571
"that Kallikantzaroi
were Goblins

23:02.640 --> 23:04.847
"who descended upon cities
to wreak havoc

23:04.920 --> 23:07.048
"during the celebration
of Christenmas.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.043
"But after several
bloody decapitations,

23:09.120 --> 23:14.570
"I was horrified to learn that they
were children of the Indole Gentile."

23:15.680 --> 23:16.841
They're kids?

23:16.920 --> 23:18.081
That's what it says.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.050
I've known several Indole
Gentile, very nice people.

23:21.120 --> 23:23.327
So where did the
Kallikantzaroi come from?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.243
There's more right here.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.688
"Kallikantzaroi are rare
among the Indole Gentile

23:28.800 --> 23:31.167
"and appear to manifest
during Pubertas,

23:31.240 --> 23:34.926
"lasting about 12 days and
linked somehow to the Bruma."

23:35.000 --> 23:36.001
The what?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.684
Oh, that's Latin
for winter solstice.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.365
Why do I know that?
I don't know.

23:41.480 --> 23:45.405
So Kallikantzaroi are
children of Indole Gentile

23:45.480 --> 23:50.122
who somehow go through a puberty
transformation during Christmas.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.287
But only at night.

23:51.360 --> 23:54.489
Yeah. I mean, I wonder if it's
triggered by the days getting shorter,

23:54.560 --> 23:55.641
you know, like Krampus.

23:55.720 --> 23:58.041
Are you telling me this is
all about raging hormones?

23:58.120 --> 24:00.964
I... You know, it's either this
or acne with them, I guess.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.326
Anything in there
about how to stop them,

24:02.400 --> 24:04.209
besides, you know,
cutting off their heads?

24:04.280 --> 24:06.169
'Cause I'm not down
with that.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.844
I understand.

24:07.920 --> 24:08.967
Let's see...

24:09.040 --> 24:11.247
"Now, knowing I was
dealing with children,

24:11.320 --> 24:14.051
"I put away my sword
and worked feverishly

24:14.160 --> 24:16.845
"to discover something
that would stop them.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.845
"King Augustus, however,
had found the answer for me.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.810
"By chance,
his mother discovered

24:23.880 --> 24:28.681
"the Kallikantzaroi were
insatiably drawn to sweet cakes.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.526
"The King ordered the Royal Baker
to create the first Stollen,

24:32.600 --> 24:35.524
"a German sweet cake
made with candied fruit.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.525
"It stood seven cubits high
and weighed six stone."

24:39.600 --> 24:41.011
Wow.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.969
That's like
an 84-pound cake.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.128
"As strange as it sounds,
when they overindulge,

24:46.200 --> 24:48.851
"it renders
the Kallikantzaroi harmless,

24:48.920 --> 24:51.400
"returning them for good
to their natural state

24:51.480 --> 24:53.562
"once the sun comes up."

24:53.640 --> 24:56.405
German sweet cake
with candied fruit?

24:56.480 --> 24:58.209
Sound like fruitcake
to anybody else?

25:00.360 --> 25:01.600
Wow.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.690
So there's actually a
reason for fruitcake. Huh.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.843
It's so great that you've been
able to embrace all this.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.445
I'm trying.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.000
And that train is just the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

25:12.080 --> 25:16.210
Actually, it's a pre-war 1935
Marklin, which survived the war

25:16.280 --> 25:17.486
by being buried
in the backyard

25:17.560 --> 25:18.891
of Monroe's
grandfather's house

25:18.960 --> 25:21.440
in the Black Forest
just outside Offenburg.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.445
That's what happens when
you're married to Monroe.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.885
I feel like the kid
I never was.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.168
Oh, that doesn't feel good.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.087
What's wrong?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.362
Just a little bit of nausea.
It's not a big deal.

25:39.440 --> 25:40.771
It's just happened
a couple of times.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.365
I can make you something.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.284
No, no, no.
It's okay, it'll pass.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.449
Okay, it's going away.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.807
I'm fine, really.
I swear.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.809
Are you possibly pregnant?

25:56.640 --> 25:57.880
I don't think so.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.564
Have you tested yourself?

25:59.640 --> 26:01.483
Well, no, but I...

26:04.160 --> 26:06.003
Oh, my God.
What?

26:07.960 --> 26:10.088
What if I got pregnant
when I was Adalind?

26:10.160 --> 26:12.367
Can that happen?
Is that possible?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.851
You weren't
really Adalind.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.921
But I was.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.411
I know you were,
but you weren't.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.369
I mean,
this is so confusing.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.283
I'm not sure I even really...

26:21.480 --> 26:22.720
Did that come
from the garage?

26:22.800 --> 26:24.006
Oh, no.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.801
Oh, crap.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.484
Where is it?
Where did it go?

26:37.800 --> 26:39.848
Oh, God, there's more?

26:42.640 --> 26:43.687
Run!

26:52.680 --> 26:53.966
Push!
Lam!

26:54.040 --> 26:55.485
I can't hold them.
They're coming in!

26:55.560 --> 26:56.686
Grab something
to hit them with!

26:56.800 --> 26:57.847
Okay.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.845
No! Don't let him
near the Marklin!

27:20.000 --> 27:21.286
No, no, you don't.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.889
Crap.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.365
No! Now, back off!

27:36.320 --> 27:37.367
No!

27:39.240 --> 27:41.288
Don't you dare!
What the hell!

27:47.040 --> 27:48.087
Get 'em!

28:02.240 --> 28:03.844
How'd they get here?

28:03.920 --> 28:05.763
It's gotta be
the smell.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.842
I mean, something
that bad travels.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.081
Well, can you
follow them?

28:09.160 --> 28:11.845
Not in three different
directions at once, I can't.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.689
And they're movin'
too fast. My God!

28:13.760 --> 28:16.240
No way we're gonna
put out an APB.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.848
Monroe, I'm so sorry.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.241
Yeah. By the time we got to the
garage, they were already out.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.845
Why didn't you guys
tell us there were more?

28:25.920 --> 28:27.251
We only had one.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.685
We didn't know
they would find each other.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.565
Ah, but you saved
the Marklin.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.086
Nobody was touching this train.
Over my dead body.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.003
Look, this was my fault,
by the way.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.525
I should never
have brought him here.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.886
Did you figure out
what it was?

28:38.960 --> 28:42.931
Yeah. A Kallikarkazoi...

28:43.000 --> 28:46.561
Yeah, it's some sort of, like,
rare seasonal hormonal disorder

28:46.640 --> 28:50.087
that apparently only affects certain
children of the Indole Gentile.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.161
They're Italian?

28:51.240 --> 28:52.366
Actually, Greek.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.489
But they're only supposed to wreak
havoc for the 12 days of Christmas.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.086
Twelve days? We have
five more days of this?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.322
Yeah, we gotta figure out where
they're gonna strike next, and...

29:00.400 --> 29:02.641
Even if we do,
how do we stop them?

29:04.960 --> 29:06.325
Fruitcake.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.841
Dempsey's a Hasslich, right?
Right.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.161
Dempsey knows Shaw
through Johnson.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.811
Shaw through Johnson.
Mmm-hmm.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.370
Nick, we got
some names for you.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.005
All these guys were
at Shaw's house today.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.730
You went
to Shaw's house?

29:18.800 --> 29:19.926
Yeah, you said
you wanted names.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.081
So I got Bud,
and we went over there.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.446
Yeah, there was a lot
going on there.

29:22.520 --> 29:23.760
it was creepy.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.968
There was a guy wearing a
robe and one of those masks.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.805
Okay. This is what
we've got so far.

29:28.880 --> 29:32.407
"Shaw Steinkellner,
Harold Johnson, Roger Briggs,

29:32.480 --> 29:34.130
"Matthew Howard,
Walter Dempsey."

29:34.200 --> 29:35.964
Harold Johnson, that's the
one we took the mask from.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.644
You think all these guys
have something to do

29:37.720 --> 29:39.290
with what's been happening
with Monroe and Rosalee?

29:39.360 --> 29:40.440
That's what we're thinkin'.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.649
I can fix him
with a little glue.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.604
What about this?

29:53.240 --> 29:56.050
Assuming we can find Santa's head.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.603
Wait a minute,
Santa's head...

29:59.480 --> 30:01.244
Santa's head...
I just saw...

30:02.240 --> 30:04.288
It's around here
somewhere.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.606
Oh!

30:06.560 --> 30:08.324
I got him.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.765
What's this?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.324
A medical-alert
bracelet?

30:14.400 --> 30:15.481
What?

30:18.680 --> 30:21.331
None of our
decorations have asthma.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.242
There were at least five
guys at Shaw's house the first time.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.448
Most of those same guys
showed up later.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.568
If all those guys
were part of that group,

30:28.680 --> 30:30.648
what if they're planning
on doing something else?

30:30.720 --> 30:33.326
Well, without any evidence tying
them to the burning Wolfsangel

30:33.400 --> 30:35.607
or the brick through the
window, I can't arrest them.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.091
Well, isn't this
a Wesen thing?

30:37.760 --> 30:41.242
Yeah, well, I try to use the
law at first, when I can.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.361
Good morning.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.646
Hey, you want coffee?

30:43.720 --> 30:44.960
Oh, yeah.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.851
Hey, I just wanted to say thanks
for letting me stay here.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.208
Hey, Nick,
you said you thought

30:53.280 --> 30:56.204
the guys who were in my dad's
house were Hungjagers?

30:56.280 --> 30:57.280
Am I saying that right?

30:57.320 --> 30:58.810
"Hund" not "Hung."

30:58.880 --> 31:00.041
Right.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.246
Uh, those are the same
kind of Wesen

31:01.320 --> 31:03.766
that attacked me and my dad
when we were out here.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.687
Look, I think I'm gonna
have to go back home

31:06.800 --> 31:08.609
and deal with this
however I can,

31:09.440 --> 31:13.445
but is there any way that I can learn
more about this stuff before I go?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.282
Yeah, I think there is.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.601
You cool with that?

31:23.680 --> 31:24.920
If you are.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.606
Monroe.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.281
Is there a name
on the medical bracelet?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.685
Wow, this place
is incredible.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.330
Hey,
wait till you see this.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.524
Oh, my God!

31:46.600 --> 31:48.090
Wait, you use all these?

31:48.160 --> 31:51.482
I've used a couple, but this is
like the history of the Grimms.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.484
Okay? What they used. Yeah. Wow.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.761
This is just
like all the stuff

31:59.840 --> 32:01.240
my dad used to have
in his basement.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.602
Everything that was
your dad's is here now.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.127
Want to learn about Hundjagers?
This is your best bet.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.886
Have a seat, there's
a lot to learn.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.207
Do you think I'll ever
become like you and Nick?

32:19.280 --> 32:20.486
I don't know.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.522
Let's hope for the best.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.891
Whatever that is.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.649
Mrs. Katsaros?
Yes?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.563
Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

32:41.640 --> 32:42.766
Do you have a son
named John?

32:42.840 --> 32:44.330
Yes, is something wrong?

32:45.040 --> 32:46.041
Is this his?

32:46.120 --> 32:47.531
Oh, my God.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.521
You're the Grimm?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.329
I'm also a cop
who's concerned

32:55.400 --> 32:58.404
that your son might be hurting
others or get hurt himself.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.286
"After dispatching three
Hundjagers at the inn,

33:07.360 --> 33:09.647
"I learned one of the most
important lessons in hunting them.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.802
"Kill the women first."

33:13.160 --> 33:14.241
That makes sense.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.727
What?

33:17.960 --> 33:18.961
Um...

33:19.280 --> 33:22.602
What do you think
my chances are if I go back?

33:23.640 --> 33:24.971
I don't know, Josh.

33:25.040 --> 33:26.041
I have a life back there.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.281
What am I supposed to do?

33:27.400 --> 33:29.040
Just go on the run
for the rest of my life

33:29.080 --> 33:30.525
just because they think
I have one of those keys?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.682
Look, I was on the run
for years.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.411
Didn't do me any good,
until I stopped running.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.847
You might have
to stop running.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.771
Kallikantzaroi?

33:42.400 --> 33:44.641
I know it's possible,
but it's rare,

33:44.720 --> 33:47.485
like Tay-Sachs disease
in the Jewish population,

33:47.560 --> 33:50.006
or sickle cell anemia
in African-Americans.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.366
Only a very
small population

33:51.440 --> 33:53.886
of Indole Gentile of Greek
heritage are even susceptible.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.200
John never showed
any signs.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.566
He's a very sweet boy.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.205
He's home every night.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.327
Are you sure?

33:59.400 --> 34:00.890
We found your
son's medical bracelet

34:00.960 --> 34:02.450
in one of the homes
that was attacked.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.561
He must have been
sneaking out at night.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.165
That would explain
why he's been so tired.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.400
Where is John now?

34:09.480 --> 34:12.130
He's performing with the St.
Demetrios Youth Choir tonight.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.043
Wait a minute.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.121
The St. Demetrios here?

34:17.520 --> 34:18.965
Yes, that's our church.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.007
It's how we all keep in touch
with our Greek heritage.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.281
People come
from miles around.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.804
Where's the choir
performing tonight?

34:23.880 --> 34:26.042
The Christmas concert and
tree lighting at the church.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.201
We were just
on our way there.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.406
That doesn't give us
much time.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.719
Do you have a photo
of John?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.040
Of course.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.202
If I could talk
to my son first, I...

34:33.280 --> 34:35.089
Sir, he's not
the only one.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.367
Thank you.

34:40.159 --> 34:43.322
Just a spot of glue
on your beard, my friend,

34:43.400 --> 34:44.764
- and you'll be as good as new.
- It's Nick.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.284
Hey, did you catch
the guy?

34:46.360 --> 34:47.565
No, but we know
where he is.

34:47.639 --> 34:49.280
And if we find him,
we'll find the others.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.400
What can we do?

34:50.480 --> 34:51.925
We're gonna need a trap.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.486
Portland PD.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.641
You got fruitcake?

35:01.720 --> 35:03.609
We do.
Right here in the truck.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.409
Best in town.
You want a sample?

35:05.480 --> 35:06.925
No.
No?

35:07.040 --> 35:08.371
We want the whole truck.

35:11.640 --> 35:16.168
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas

35:16.240 --> 35:21.724
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year

35:21.800 --> 35:26.886
Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin

35:26.960 --> 35:32.410
We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year

35:39.480 --> 35:40.686
I hope this works.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.285
it better.
It's already dark.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.284
Which means they'll be stinkin'
up that choir room any second.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.124
I hope nobody we know
sees us.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.040
I don't wanna have
to explain what we're doing.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.491
We just...

35:50.560 --> 35:52.449
We just tell them
we needed to be able

35:52.520 --> 35:54.727
to find our way
back to the church.

35:59.080 --> 36:05.804
Holy infant
so tender and mild

36:07.320 --> 36:08.685
There he is.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.683
- We gotta get him out of here.
- Too late.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.000
Oh!

36:15.400 --> 36:17.004
Everyone! Move it!

36:17.080 --> 36:18.491
What the hell
is going on?

36:18.560 --> 36:19.925
Stop it right now!

36:20.920 --> 36:21.921
Get back!

36:26.040 --> 36:27.166
Everyone, back!

36:29.920 --> 36:31.251
Get back! Get back!

36:52.360 --> 36:53.486
Okay, now!

37:02.600 --> 37:03.601
You get 'em all?

37:03.680 --> 37:06.001
We got three of 'em.
Let's hope that's all.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.491
Get 'em out of here.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.808
- Anybody know who they were?
- Whose kids were those?

37:14.920 --> 37:16.365
The tree is ruined!

37:16.440 --> 37:18.681
I couldn't tell.
They were all dressed up!

37:18.760 --> 37:20.046
My son is still here.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.289
How much longer
do we have to wait?

37:27.400 --> 37:29.448
It's been quiet
for quite a while now.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.090
Are we sure
this is over?

37:31.160 --> 37:33.527
Well, according to the
book, once the sun comes up,

37:33.600 --> 37:36.331
they're supposed to return to
their natural state for good.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.764
Let's do it.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.328
Oh, you're not going
to arrest them, are you?

37:43.400 --> 37:45.084
The town thinks
it was just a practical joke.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.725
Let's let 'em
think that.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.204
Thank God.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.761
They're okay.

38:04.360 --> 38:07.045
They look so innocent.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.608
You know, you're not
gonna believe this,

38:13.680 --> 38:16.490
but I kinda have a craving
for some fruitcake.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.891
You saved some
of that?

38:17.960 --> 38:20.406
It's not as bad
as its reputation.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.771
Hey, thanks for
your help on this one.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.802
Listen, I think we have got a line
on some of the people involved

38:27.880 --> 38:30.486
in burning the Wolfsangel and throwing
the brick through the window.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.928
As soon as we've got anything,
we'll let you know.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.088
All right. Thank you.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.931
You know,

38:42.600 --> 38:44.011
if you're not
going to eat that...

38:45.280 --> 38:46.850
It's all yours.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.128
You are up
awfully early.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.287
I wanted to get
an early start.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.408
What?
You goin' somewhere?

39:27.840 --> 39:29.251
Nick,

39:29.920 --> 39:31.968
I can't thank you enough.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.200
You saved my life.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.247
You're a Grimm again, and things
here are sort of back to normal.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.322
And you don't need me
as much as you did.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.731
Is this about Chavez?

39:40.800 --> 39:42.131
A little.

39:43.120 --> 39:46.124
You know, I don't trust them, and
I don't think it's right for me.

39:46.200 --> 39:49.044
Just let me finish,
or I might not make it.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.169
Josh came here,
and I heard his story.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.526
He wants to go
back home.

39:53.960 --> 39:57.282
I don't think we should let
him do that by himself.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.086
You wanna help Josh?

39:59.160 --> 40:01.208
Yeah, I think
I should try.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.083
But, um,

40:05.160 --> 40:09.484
I can't, you know,
say goodbye to everybody.

40:10.160 --> 40:13.642
Monroe and Rosalee
and Hank.

40:13.720 --> 40:14.926
But, um,
especially Juliette.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.161
Yeah, look...

40:18.360 --> 40:20.010
We're not going anywhere.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.529
And I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.488
And you know you can
always come back.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.603
How are you gonna get there?

40:43.160 --> 40:44.605
We'll figure it out.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.050
I think I have something
that might help.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.646
This was my Aunt Marie's.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.722
This is what she brought
the trailer here with.

41:00.200 --> 41:04.046
I didn't want to sell it, but this seems
like a good way for it to move on.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.770
I promise to take
good care of it.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.247
Uh-uh.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.361
First shift.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.647
I wish there was something
more I could give you.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.926
Nick,

41:14.800 --> 41:15.961
you gave me my life.
