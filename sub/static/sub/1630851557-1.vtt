WEBVTT

00:25.984 --> 00:27.069
Sir.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.658
What is it, Rolf?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.826
Your nephew is here.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.998
Can you put this in the box, please?

00:43.252 --> 00:44.962
Uncle Máximo!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.714
Hugo! Welcome back to Malibu.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.591
Happy birthday.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.511
I have been waiting for this for weeks.

00:52.594 --> 00:55.514
So, what's the big surprise
you have planned for me this year?

00:56.014 --> 00:58.100
Are we taking your private jet
somewhere cool?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.518
Can I buy sneakers in Shanghai?

00:59.601 --> 01:03.313
Well, we are going on a journey of sorts.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.734
Now that you're 14
and on the road to manhood,

01:08.235 --> 01:11.613
I've decided to tell you my life story.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.283
You're worth hundreds
of millions of dollars,

01:14.366 --> 01:16.702
and your gift to me is a story?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.580
Believe me, Hugo...

01:19.663 --> 01:21.123
...what I'm about to tell you

01:21.206 --> 01:24.042
is more valuable than any amount of money.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.005
But I already know your
whole rags-to-riches thing.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.465
You grew up on the poor streets of Mexico,

01:30.549 --> 01:34.178
blah, blah, blah,
and now you own, like, 50 companies.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.346
So, yes. Yes, I have many houses,

01:36.847 --> 01:39.558
lots of cars, an all-white butler.

01:39.641 --> 01:43.020
100% too. I had him do a 23andMe.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.565
But it's important for you
to know how I got here.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.318
You have no connection
to our family's history.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.945
You can't even speak Spanish without

01:52.029 --> 01:53.780
sounding like a spring breaker in Cancún.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.325
My Spanish I am very good.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.618
Stop. Stop.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.662
It's just sad for everyone.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.499
This story is about me, but it's also...

02:05.792 --> 02:08.294
It's also about a place
that changed everything.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.547
And this is better than Shanghai because?

02:11.423 --> 02:13.300
Wrong attitude.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.845
Maybe this will help.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.898
Uncle Máximo, how does this story start?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.983
That's a great question, Hugo.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.905
It all starts... in Acapulco.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.284
Back when I was growing up,

02:39.368 --> 02:44.289
Acapulco was the destination
for the very rich and the very famous.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.793
Elvis Presley, Liz Taylor, Cary Grant--

02:47.876 --> 02:49.503
I have never heard of any of those people.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.046
Quiet. I'm on a roll.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.133
And the center of it was Las Colinas.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.554
The most glamorous resort of all.

02:59.304 --> 03:03.141
For tourists, Las Colinas
and Acapulco were a magical getaway.

03:03.225 --> 03:06.270
But for locals, it was a different story.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.479
By age eight,

03:07.563 --> 03:10.566
I was doing everything I could
to help the family.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.861
But the only real way
to make a better life

03:15.028 --> 03:17.698
was to get a job at Las Colinas.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.118
Just like Don Pablo did.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.209
Don Pablo Bonilla was a former street kid

03:29.293 --> 03:32.713
who had charmed his way
into a job at Las Colinas.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.840
But to me, he was a legend.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.552
I still remember the day
he came back to the old neighborhood.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.389
Don Pablo!
I want to be like you when I grow up!

03:43.473 --> 03:45.559
Careful what you wish for, kid.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.811
Here… this is for you.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.776
Stay away from him, son.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.113
I already told you anything he has
comes straight from the devil's lair!

03:59.573 --> 04:03.160
That night, I went up
to the roof of our building

04:03.243 --> 04:07.789
and told my sister that one day
I would work at Las Colinas,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.709
and it would change everything.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.214
Of that, I was certain.

04:19.510 --> 04:24.515
Well, Dad, it's here.
My first day at a real job.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.476
You have any advice for me?

04:30.020 --> 04:32.397
Okay, maybe next time then.

04:33.232 --> 04:36.151
Anyway, watch over me today, will you?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.278
I don't want to mess this one up.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.614
Not just for me, but for our family.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.409
Your abuelita was working

04:44.493 --> 04:46.870
three housekeeping jobs
just to support us.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.414
But also, her eyesight was failing,

04:49.998 --> 04:52.376
and we didn't know how much longer
she could keep working.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.921
Even though your dad's not here to say it,
we're both so proud of you.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.468
All your coworkers at the bus depot
are going to love you.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.516
Máximo.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.351
I love you, dear brother!

05:09.434 --> 05:11.854
I'll have dinner ready for you
when you get home.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.858
Wait. Hold on. That's my mom?

05:15.941 --> 05:18.193
There's just no way
she was ever like that.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.487
Okay, you're right.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.948
It was more like...

05:23.031 --> 05:24.116
Máximo.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.410
Good luck at work.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.121
Enjoy being just another cog
in the wheel of capitalism!

05:33.876 --> 05:34.877
Máximo!

05:36.003 --> 05:37.087
Guess what?

05:37.171 --> 05:39.923
The moment we've been waiting
for our entire lives is here!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.633
You lost your virginity?

05:41.717 --> 05:43.010
That's big news!

05:43.093 --> 05:44.386
Who'd you do it with? Your third cousin?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.722
Don't tell me it was your second cousin.
Any closer than a third cousin is weird.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.975
No, no. I didn't lose my virginity.
This is better news!

05:50.058 --> 05:51.185
Well, maybe just as good.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.187
My neighbor Tito has a buddy, Jorge,

05:53.270 --> 05:54.813
whose brother is Miguel,

05:54.897 --> 05:56.815
and Miguel said
that his friend, Francisco, told him

05:56.899 --> 05:58.734
that Las Colinas Resort
put out an announcement

05:58.817 --> 06:00.527
that they're hiring new staff!

06:00.611 --> 06:03.155
And I got us interviews
there this morning!

06:04.364 --> 06:05.741
Wow, that's amazing!

06:07.951 --> 06:08.994
But I can't.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.581
Today's my first day of work
at the bus depot.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.459
But this has always been
our biggest dream!

06:16.335 --> 06:17.961
Just picture your mom,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.631
her eyes totally healed.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.759
And she's in a huge oceanside mansion

06:24.343 --> 06:28.472
not because she's cleaning it,
but because you bought it for her!

06:44.905 --> 06:45.989
Hey!

06:46.573 --> 06:48.367
The service entrance is around the back.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.535
Go on, get over there!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.620
I hate interview day.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.043
I don't even know what to put here.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.672
What do you mean you were

07:01.755 --> 07:05.217
"President of Advertising
for a late-night entertainment company"?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.343
Of course I was!

07:06.426 --> 07:11.139
What would you call passing out flyers
for the city's most popular strip club?

07:12.349 --> 07:13.433
I'd call it lying, Memo.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.520
No, it's called embellishing.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.105
You gotta stand out.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.773
Máximo Gallardo?

07:19.857 --> 07:22.359
Go see Miss Garcia.
Last office on the left.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.074
As I walked past the other applicants,

07:29.741 --> 07:32.536
I wondered how I'd
stand out from the rest.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.667
And then I saw his name on a door.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.670
I realized I had nothing to lose.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.046
Excuse me, Don Pablo?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.966
We speak English here.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.135
My name is Máximo.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.095
I'm interviewing for a job at the resort.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.556
Interviews are over there.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.558
I understand.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.312
It's just, I grew up
on Arenal Street just like you.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.563
I still live there.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.860
-But the reason I'm here today--
-Please.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.403
Close the door on your way out.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.710
You gave me this once,

08:22.252 --> 08:25.130
and I've carried it around
in my pocket ever since,

08:26.089 --> 08:29.176
hoping that one day I'd get
to meet you again.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.140
And now that I have,

08:36.225 --> 08:40.102
I'm just gonna see my way out.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.232
What did you say your name was?

08:45.609 --> 08:47.528
Máximo Gallardo Ramos, sir.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.947
Let me see your application.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.996
We have over a hundred applicants.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.834
Every one of them speaks English
and has more experience than you.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.088
Why would I hire you over one of them?

09:09.508 --> 09:12.928
Because those other people,
they are here for a job.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.890
I'm here because I love this place,
just like you do.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.561
You've worked at Las Colinas since

09:20.644 --> 09:23.856
the day the gates opened
on March 12th, 1949.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.566
You've been through four owners,

09:25.649 --> 09:28.110
three hurricanes, two renovations,

09:28.610 --> 09:31.029
the great jicama recall of 1972,

09:31.989 --> 09:33.949
and one awful bed bugs infestation.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.037
Rumor has it, you've only
missed one day of work, ever.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.665
Would it have been so hard

09:41.748 --> 09:43.542
to have Grandpa's funeral on a Saturday?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.256
It's been my dream to work at Las Colinas
since I was eight years old.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.092
Now here I am.

09:52.885 --> 09:56.597
And the only thing
that I truly lack is opportunity.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.684
If you give me that, then I promise you,

10:01.602 --> 10:03.645
you will never regret it.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.443
Hey, I'm home.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.361
Hi, Mama.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.988
"Mama"?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.449
And you're washing the dishes?

10:16.575 --> 10:20.871
Máximo Gallardo Ramos, what did you do?

10:20.954 --> 10:24.875
Yeah, Máximo, tell Mom what you did.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.630
I didn't make it to work
because I got a better job...

10:33.926 --> 10:35.260
at Las Colinas Resort.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.641
I told you to always stay away
from that cesspool of lust and sin!

10:40.724 --> 10:43.644
That exploits its workers
and romanticizes our culture.

10:46.188 --> 10:49.983
That's also full of lust and sin.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.237
What would your dad say?

10:54.404 --> 10:55.989
Maybe he'd be happy.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.493
Dad worked his ass off as a bus driver,
and for what?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.662
To end up falling asleep at the wheel
and dying!

11:02.496 --> 11:06.166
At least this job gives me
the chance to make a better life for us.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.628
We can finally
get your eyes checked out, Mom.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.963
My eyes are fine.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.093
Last week, I saw you praying
to one of my old wrestling action figures.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.428
It's 'cause I wanted him to win.

11:20.806 --> 11:21.807
Mom...

11:23.517 --> 11:25.936
you raised me to be a good person.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.022
I promise you
nothing will ever threaten that.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.739
Promise me you're not gonna let
that place change you.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.579
And that you'll wear your father's pendant
so he can protect you.

11:49.751 --> 11:53.297
How boring! I thought this was
gonna be way more exciting.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.891
I can't believe I'm sitting here.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.018
I can't believe I'm sitting anywhere.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.978
My family just has the one chair.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.900
Hello, my fabulous darlings.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.860
Welcome to the famous

12:14.943 --> 12:18.864
and infamous Las Colinas Resort.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.617
It's me, Diane Davies.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.493
You might remember me from...

12:23.577 --> 12:24.661
I love you.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.208
My celebrated roles in daytime TV,

12:29.791 --> 12:32.503
my groundbreaking workout videos...

12:32.586 --> 12:35.672
And grind, and grind, and grind--

12:35.756 --> 12:37.883
My line of meal-replacement shakes.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.760
I feel thinner already.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.930
And my best-selling autobiography.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.057
I bought this little slice of heaven

12:45.140 --> 12:49.144
with two words in mind,
"total excellence."

12:49.228 --> 12:50.687
So if you've made it this far,

12:50.771 --> 12:56.068
it's because my hiring staff
saw potential in you. Hooray.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.654
You can clap now.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.284
The wealthiest, most fascinating

13:04.368 --> 13:09.039
international jet-setters
come here to play.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.086
Stupid laser disc.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.338
Hello, folks. My name is Chad.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.090
And as the General Manager,

13:18.173 --> 13:21.468
it is my job to protect
the brand of Las Colinas.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.971
And what is that brand, you may ask.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.890
Well, I'll show you.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.934
Vámonos. Come on.

13:29.518 --> 13:33.230
The number one thing we pride
ourselves on here is discretion, okay?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.274
People come here
to take a break from their lives,

13:35.357 --> 13:37.401
not to have their lives
splashed all over the Enquirer.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.112
So, sure, I can tell you why
there was a bloodstain

13:40.195 --> 13:42.948
right there that would've landed
multiple parties

13:43.031 --> 13:44.908
in la prisión, but I won't.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.744
You know why? Discretion.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.580
Good. Let's proceed.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.332
So this is the lobby.

13:52.416 --> 13:56.253
Pretty bodacious, right?
You guys know the word "bodacious?"

13:57.462 --> 14:00.215
This is our head bartender, Beto.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.968
This guy's got thousands of stories
about celebrities he's met,

14:03.051 --> 14:04.720
and a few of them are actually true.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.639
My friend Marlon Brando
makes the same joke about me.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.100
Is this even reality?

14:15.647 --> 14:19.026
If it's a dream, I never wanna wake up.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.324
Hey! Hombre, let's go.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.851
This is the epicenter
of the entire resort.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.978
This is where all the action is.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.398
Máximo Gallardo, you're working here.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.984
Memo Reyes?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.403
That's me. Am I at the pool too?

15:03.487 --> 15:05.614
Actually, your application
stated that you were the

15:05.697 --> 15:09.326
"Chief Operating Officer
of an international garment organization?"

15:09.743 --> 15:10.786
That's correct, sir.

15:11.870 --> 15:14.998
What? My mom used to make me
fold our Guatemalan neighbors' laundry.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.502
No, no, no. No Spanish
around the guests, hermano, ever.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.004
And I felt that only someone
with your credentials

15:21.088 --> 15:22.840
could handle this very coveted assignment.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.845
See. I embellished
and look where that got me.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.516
Sheets first, then the towels.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.395
Get on it!

15:37.563 --> 15:39.857
So whatever questions you have,
Héctor can answer 'em all.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.192
He is the best export
to ever come out of Argentinia.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.320
-Hey. Take care of the new guy, will ya?
-No problem, boss.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.658
I'm Héctor, but people call me
Héctor the Protector.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.202
And I'm actually from Spain,
but to the gringos,

15:52.286 --> 15:53.287
it's all the same.

15:54.621 --> 15:58.333
We take care of everything
and everyone around here.

16:01.587 --> 16:02.629
That should get rid of it, ma'am.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.298
My hero.

16:04.381 --> 16:07.843
The key is to anticipate everyone's needs.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.804
You do that, poof, you are golden.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.435
Not on my watch.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.481
I and the father are one.

16:22.608 --> 16:23.942
Teach me everything, master.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.069
Trust me, amigo, I would love nothing more

16:26.153 --> 16:30.657
than to freely teach you
all that I know, but I don't want to.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.577
Héctor, a little help
with this raft, please?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.245
Of course, my horse.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.124
Good luck, papi.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.503
-Hi, Amy.
-Héctor, I need your help.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.588
-The kids are torturing me.
-Yes? Right away. Right away, sir.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.923
As I looked around,

16:46.006 --> 16:50.802
my mom's talk of sin
and excess seemed completely ridiculous.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.555
To me, they just seemed
like normal tourists

16:53.639 --> 16:54.973
enjoying their vacations.

17:18.664 --> 17:22.584
Okay. Maybe they weren't quite
as normal as I thought.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.919
Wow.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.679
And that's when I saw her again.

17:35.305 --> 17:38.058
And she saw me this time too, Hugo.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.395
And do you know what that means?

17:43.564 --> 17:45.023
It means we saw each other.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.902
I had to go speak to her.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.534
Hi. I'm Máximo. Just started today.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.536
Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Julia.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.831
So I just served filet mignon to a dog.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.542
Is that normal here?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.335
It's more normal than you'd think.

18:05.419 --> 18:06.420
Where are you working?

18:06.503 --> 18:07.921
Right now, I'm a pool boy.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.674
But before you know it,
I'll be the manager.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.844
And one day, I'm gonna own this place.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.597
Well, I love the confidence.

18:16.680 --> 18:20.017
And your English, it's quite good.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.561
Thank you.
I had the best English teachers,

18:22.644 --> 18:26.815
Luke Skywalker,
Indiana Jones, Danny Zuko...

18:26.899 --> 18:29.193
I had pretty good English teachers too,

18:29.276 --> 18:33.614
Jane Austen,
Emily Brontë, Virginia Woolf...

18:34.114 --> 18:35.616
No offense, but those sound like

18:35.699 --> 18:37.117
really boring movie characters.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.411
They're actually authors.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.038
Some of the great ones too.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.583
But I am also hopelessly devoted
to Grease.

18:45.083 --> 18:49.087
In that moment,
it was clear Julia was the one.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.590
I could tell just from
the look in her eyes.

18:51.673 --> 18:55.260
-You want to kiss me, don't you?
-Yes.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.806
Wait. Stop.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.476
You kissed her? Just like that?

19:02.559 --> 19:05.270
Okay, no. I'm just trying
to spice things up.

19:05.354 --> 19:07.856
I know you kids need stuff
to happen every two minutes,

19:07.940 --> 19:11.026
or you start texting each other
peach and eggplant emojis.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.738
But I did feel a connection.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.116
Well, until you own
the place and tell me not to,

19:18.200 --> 19:20.077
I have to get back to work.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.627
Bit of free advice, son?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.046
Yes. I'd love any advice from you.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.465
If you wanna keep this job,

19:33.966 --> 19:36.510
maybe don't hit on the boss's girlfriend.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.138
What does mean? Who's Julia's boyfriend?

19:43.642 --> 19:46.854
If it makes you feel better,
you never had a shot anyway.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.732
Stop it.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.485
I don't know, Memo.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.779
It seems like this place
isn't what I thought it was.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.281
Are you serious?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.283
What could be better than this?

20:01.159 --> 20:03.996
Okay, maybe not this this.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.832
But you have
the opportunity of a lifetime.

20:07.416 --> 20:08.542
Make the most of it!

20:08.625 --> 20:11.378
For example, see this awesome earring?

20:11.461 --> 20:14.298
Lupe let me pick out something
from the guest lost and found

20:14.381 --> 20:17.259
because I gave her
one of my mom's famous tortas.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.637
You would not believe what's in there.

20:20.721 --> 20:24.850
Diamonds, Cuban cigars,
rings, an iguana that's...

20:24.933 --> 20:26.768
And you chose that earring?

20:26.852 --> 20:28.353
Exactly!

20:28.437 --> 20:30.814
I claimed it as soon as I saw it.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.400
Dreams come true here.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.445
So if it seems like
something's out of your reach,

20:36.528 --> 20:38.280
just reach a little farther.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.409
Great advice.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.913
Terrible earring. But great advice.

20:54.338 --> 20:57.049
Nothing in life should be this difficult.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.717
I'm so sorry about this.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.802
These are usually served opened.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.721
Well, be careful. Don't hurt yourself.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.556
-I only need a cigar.
-Can I help with that, Ms. Davies?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.058
I don't know. Do you happen to carry

21:06.141 --> 21:07.684
a spare bottle opener on you?

21:07.768 --> 21:10.270
They brought the bucket,
but we can't seem to find the opener.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.108
Is he doing a magic trick?

21:15.192 --> 21:16.985
Maybe he'll turn it into a margarita.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.574
Bravo.

21:22.658 --> 21:23.784
It's an old trick.

21:23.867 --> 21:24.910
But it only works in Mexico.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.079
The dollar is stronger down here.

21:29.706 --> 21:30.749
That's funny.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.501
-He's funny.
-He's funny.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.836
Are you new?

21:33.919 --> 21:35.587
Today is my first day actually.

21:35.671 --> 21:37.297
Well, you're off to a good start.

21:37.381 --> 21:40.300
Guys, this is our new
Héctor the Protector.

21:40.384 --> 21:41.510
I give you...

21:42.386 --> 21:43.637
I'm sorry, what's your name?

21:44.137 --> 21:47.766
I'm Máximo the... Just Máximo.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.561
Máximo the Just Máximo.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.730
That's terrible. You have to work on that.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.108
These are my friends, the Bennetts.

21:56.191 --> 21:58.360
They just arrived all the way
from Schenectady.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.529
Will you please show them to their cabana?

22:00.946 --> 22:04.032
-And take very good care of them.
-Thank you, Diane.

22:04.116 --> 22:05.325
You're so welcome.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.827
Whatever you need, Ms. Davies.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.293
You're burning.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.419
-I always burn.
-I see you.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.587
Here we are.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.548
This is perfect.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.633
Oh, I love this.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.510
Come sit.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.012
Anything else I can do for you?

22:25.095 --> 22:27.306
Yes. We'd like some grass.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.599
No problem.

22:29.099 --> 22:32.978
Do you mean, like,
from the golf course, or front lawn or...

22:33.061 --> 22:34.104
Funny.

22:34.188 --> 22:38.775
No. She meant Mary Jane. Reefer.

22:38.859 --> 22:41.653
Acapulco Gold. Comprende?

22:41.737 --> 22:46.909
Oh, I see. So, you're asking me
to get you drugs?

22:47.784 --> 22:49.036
Yes.

22:49.119 --> 22:50.871
We have five days without the kiddos,

22:50.954 --> 22:54.124
and we want to get baked.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.710
So, you gonna help us out, Máximo,

22:56.793 --> 22:59.129
or should we just ask Héctor to do it?

22:59.213 --> 23:00.672
Need me, Mr. Bennett?

23:00.756 --> 23:02.341
Do we, Máximo?

23:07.387 --> 23:08.430
No.

23:11.642 --> 23:14.353
When do you need these medicinal aids?

23:14.436 --> 23:18.106
Sunsets in Acapulco are
a stunning experience to behold.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.652
And we wanna be zonked out
of our minds when it happens.

23:23.278 --> 23:25.614
Better hurry.
'Cause if we miss the sunset,

23:26.448 --> 23:29.076
it'll be no bueno, amigo.

23:30.202 --> 23:31.411
Okay, I'll be right back.

23:33.372 --> 23:36.875
I suddenly found myself
in a terrible situation, Hugo.

23:36.959 --> 23:40.587
If I didn't help the owner's friends,
I could get fired.

23:41.380 --> 23:45.133
If I got caught with drugs,
that could also get me fired.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.762
I had to navigate this very carefully.

23:51.765 --> 23:54.226
Hi, Beto. I'm Máximo. I'm new here.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.980
Some guests just asked me
to get something for them.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.147
Oh, you want a menu.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.983
No, I doubt this is on the menu.

24:01.066 --> 24:04.653
It's a plant, but I can't say what it is.

24:05.946 --> 24:07.322
I see.

24:07.406 --> 24:09.241
-Javier! Come here.
-What's up, Beto?

24:10.117 --> 24:12.578
Listen, Máximo here needs a plant,

24:12.661 --> 24:14.204
but doesn't know the name of it.

24:14.288 --> 24:16.331
It's an indoor plant or outdoor plant?

24:16.915 --> 24:18.125
I don't--

24:18.208 --> 24:22.212
It's more in the herbal realm.
It relaxes you...

24:23.046 --> 24:24.047
Gotcha.

24:24.131 --> 24:25.674
Juanita! Come over!

24:25.757 --> 24:27.801
Juanita loves to make different iced teas.

24:27.885 --> 24:30.637
-What's the flavor like?
-No, it's not really a tea.

24:31.513 --> 24:34.141
Usually. And it might not exactly be...

24:34.892 --> 24:37.311
-approved.
-This is a tough one.

24:37.394 --> 24:38.562
It's a real head-scratcher.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.731
Okay, just so we're all on the same page,

24:40.814 --> 24:43.025
it's a plant, but we don't know what kind.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.402
And it's a herb, but it's not a tea.

24:48.822 --> 24:49.948
-Basil!
-Tarragon.

24:50.032 --> 24:51.283
-Coriander!
-It has to be basil.

24:51.366 --> 24:52.951
-Sorry, it's a trick question.
-Coriander!

24:53.035 --> 24:55.245
You're all correct! Yay!

24:59.958 --> 25:01.752
I love hazing the new recruits.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.170
Hey.

25:04.922 --> 25:07.257
Memo! I've got a problem.

25:07.341 --> 25:11.053
I need to get weed for some of
Diane's friends, or else she'll fire me.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.055
But I have no idea where to get it.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.223
What should I do?

25:14.306 --> 25:17.184
Well, maybe Lupe has some
in the lost and found.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.811
I'll wait here.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.154
Hi, Lupe.

25:30.405 --> 25:33.617
I'm Máximo, Memo's best friend.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.830
By any chance, do you have
any marijuana in the lost and found?

25:38.914 --> 25:40.958
No, yes. Yes, I have some.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.210
What are you gonna give me for it?

25:43.293 --> 25:45.921
Just this morning, Jorge in accounting

25:46.004 --> 25:49.007
gave me one of his teeth for a Rolex.

25:49.675 --> 25:51.218
What did you want his tooth for?

25:51.301 --> 25:53.554
I don't care about his tooth.

25:53.637 --> 25:58.517
I just wanted to know
how badly he wanted what I had.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.312
Well, I don't have valuables to give you.

26:02.396 --> 26:06.733
I only have a few coins,
some meal vouchers,

26:06.817 --> 26:08.569
my dad's pendant necklace...

26:09.820 --> 26:11.071
Let me see it.

26:14.825 --> 26:17.244
And how important is this
necklace to you, kid?

26:18.954 --> 26:21.081
Really important.
More than you can imagine.

26:21.164 --> 26:22.291
Hand it over.

26:22.374 --> 26:23.250
No. This?

26:23.333 --> 26:24.251
Yep.

26:24.334 --> 26:27.796
You don't want this. How about a tooth?
I don't even use this one.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.007
My offer expires in three...

26:30.090 --> 26:31.884
Please, Lupe, anything but this.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.260
Two...

26:33.343 --> 26:34.636
I'm begging you. Don't do this to me.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.846
One...

26:42.603 --> 26:45.022
Here you go. With minutes to spare.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.565
Well done, Máximo.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.858
Good work, sport.

26:48.442 --> 26:49.651
I hope it's to your liking.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.405
I couldn't believe what I had done.

26:54.907 --> 26:58.619
All my mom's fears came to life
on my very first day.

26:59.244 --> 27:01.705
I felt awful about it.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.215
Máximo.

27:11.882 --> 27:13.050
Máximo.

27:15.385 --> 27:16.428
So?

27:17.513 --> 27:19.389
How was your first day?

27:20.807 --> 27:21.892
Not great.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.352
I had to do…

27:25.145 --> 27:26.313
some bad stuff.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.857
You? Yeah, right.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.984
What "bad stuff" did you have to do?

27:31.568 --> 27:35.072
I traded Dad's pendant
to get drugs for a guest.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.365
No shit!

27:38.534 --> 27:41.203
And Mom says I'm the problem child?

27:41.286 --> 27:44.331
I feel horrible,
but I didn't have a choice.

27:45.666 --> 27:48.544
Well, yeah, I did have a choice,
but I didn't want to get fired.

27:49.044 --> 27:51.505
Sara, do you think I'm a bad person?

27:52.464 --> 27:53.966
Nah.

27:54.049 --> 27:57.594
Annoying? Yes.
But, bad? Not even one bit.

27:58.762 --> 28:00.889
I know that whatever happens there,

28:00.973 --> 28:03.267
you're only doing it
so we can have a better life.

28:03.350 --> 28:05.477
And maybe a convertible.

28:05.561 --> 28:07.813
Yeah, that too.

28:10.107 --> 28:11.108
Thanks.

28:12.484 --> 28:15.112
-So what kind of drugs?
-And we're done.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.008
Máximo.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.011
Everything all right?

28:39.553 --> 28:42.097
Yeah. I'm just...

28:44.850 --> 28:46.727
Not sure I feel comfortable here.

28:49.730 --> 28:52.649
I think I had this idea in my head of

28:52.733 --> 28:55.110
what it'd be like working
at a place like this.

28:57.529 --> 28:58.780
But it's...

28:59.573 --> 29:00.866
Not that.

29:02.075 --> 29:03.118
I see.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.121
How have you done it?

29:07.122 --> 29:09.166
I mean, the things you must have seen

29:09.249 --> 29:11.251
and been a part of here over the years.

29:12.753 --> 29:16.006
It's been my greatest honor
working at this resort.

29:17.591 --> 29:20.761
It gave me pride. A sense of purpose.

29:22.221 --> 29:25.098
And enough money
to give my wife and son a better life.

29:25.891 --> 29:28.477
But because of my devotion
to this place...

29:30.854 --> 29:34.358
I've also sacrificed more
than I ever would have imagined.

29:35.317 --> 29:39.780
Yet, somehow, I still feel lucky
every day I'm here.

29:40.489 --> 29:43.700
Sounds like you've given up a lot
to work at Las Colinas.

29:44.868 --> 29:46.954
Every dream has its price.

29:48.288 --> 29:49.957
I was willing to risk it.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.543
Are you?

30:01.635 --> 30:05.055
Thank you so much for this
incredible opportunity, Ms. Davies.

30:05.138 --> 30:07.474
It was a dream come true to work here.

30:07.558 --> 30:09.142
-I just don't think I can--
-There he is!

30:09.226 --> 30:11.186
Máximo the Just Máximo.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.647
I think I'm starting to like the name.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.774
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.

30:16.525 --> 30:19.444
If you don't mind, I think I'd like
to talk with Ms. Davies.

30:19.820 --> 30:22.072
Diane, this guy's amazing.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.824
A real find.

30:23.907 --> 30:26.827
He is so hardworking, committed--

30:30.163 --> 30:32.875
-A little something from us.
-Thank you.

30:36.253 --> 30:37.796
$200?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.131
You earned it, my man.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.924
You really did.

30:41.008 --> 30:42.551
Máximo.

30:42.634 --> 30:44.803
Is there something
you wanted to say to me?

30:48.432 --> 30:51.059
This was the deciding moment
in my life, Hugo.

30:52.186 --> 30:54.396
The money or my principles?

30:55.147 --> 30:57.900
Back to the bus depot
or into the great unknown?

30:58.942 --> 31:01.111
My mother's approval

31:01.195 --> 31:03.864
or my family's entire financial future?

31:07.451 --> 31:08.744
Surprise!

31:10.037 --> 31:12.122
-What's up?
-What's this?

31:12.206 --> 31:14.208
I don't need these.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.335
At least try them on. For me.

31:24.843 --> 31:26.345
What do you think?

31:27.554 --> 31:29.890
I think... I can see again.

31:31.517 --> 31:33.560
Máximo, you look so handsome!

31:34.269 --> 31:35.437
Sara!

31:36.897 --> 31:38.398
Why are you dressed so weird?

31:38.899 --> 31:42.402
Oh, cool, Máximo. Mom can see again.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.823
Máximo, these seem like expensive glasses.
How did you get them?

31:46.907 --> 31:49.451
I told you I could make
some good dough at this job.

31:50.035 --> 31:52.079
But these glasses are just a quick fix.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.623
We still need to take you to
a real eye doctor.

31:54.706 --> 31:57.751
Máximo, now that I can
look straight into your eyes,

31:57.835 --> 31:59.086
tell me the truth.

32:00.504 --> 32:03.048
Did you get this money...

32:04.049 --> 32:06.677
doing something I wouldn't be proud of?

32:07.511 --> 32:11.557
Mom, you know I can't lie to you.

32:14.393 --> 32:16.186
Not in the slightest.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.941
And that's how my whole journey began.

32:21.024 --> 32:23.694
Wait. But that can't be the whole story.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.571
I wanna hear more.

32:26.113 --> 32:28.490
Like, what happened with Julia?

32:28.574 --> 32:30.325
And abuelita's eye problems.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.495
And your job now that you're clearly
on Diane's good side.

32:33.579 --> 32:35.914
Look who likes
my birthday present after all.

32:38.876 --> 32:40.210
Come with me.

32:44.756 --> 32:46.175
What is all this stuff?

32:47.426 --> 32:49.553
The answers to your questions.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.598
Here.

32:55.350 --> 32:56.935
Man, this is a thick book.

32:57.519 --> 32:59.396
I said the same thing to her.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.648
Hugo, my boy.

33:03.192 --> 33:05.944
Life often takes unexpected turns.

33:11.158 --> 33:13.702
Máximo. Máximo.

33:16.830 --> 33:19.583
-What's this?
-It's called a book.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.627
Yes, I know that much.

33:21.710 --> 33:23.253
Why are you giving it to me?

33:23.337 --> 33:25.589
I thought you'd want to read
one of the classics.

33:25.672 --> 33:28.800
And if you like it,
we can start a book club or something.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.470
Are they always this thick?

33:32.054 --> 33:33.847
You're lucky
I'm not giving you War and Peace.

33:33.931 --> 33:35.307
But look inside.

33:43.315 --> 33:44.483
Thank you.

33:45.442 --> 33:48.111
This is very nice.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.739
Well, read chapter one before
the end of the week,

33:50.822 --> 33:52.783
'cause there is gonna be a test.

33:56.995 --> 34:00.207
Memo, working here
is gonna be good for us, right?

34:00.290 --> 34:01.500
You bet it is.

34:01.583 --> 34:04.837
Lupe said that on my birthday,
I get to wash my own clothes here.

34:04.920 --> 34:05.921
I'm telling you.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.674
One day, I'm gonna buy one
of those mansions in the hills,

34:08.757 --> 34:10.342
and you're gonna buy the one next to me.

34:10.425 --> 34:14.263
And me, you, my mom, Sara, your family,

34:14.346 --> 34:15.764
whatever cousin you decide on,

34:15.848 --> 34:18.809
and Julia are all gonna
live happily ever after.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.562
It's possible. Maybe not the Julia part,

34:21.645 --> 34:23.813
-but the rest can totally happen.
-Why would you say that?

34:23.897 --> 34:26.024
'Cause of Chad? Who's this Chad anyway?

34:26.608 --> 34:28.318
Mom! The car is here!

34:29.194 --> 34:30.195
Thank you, Chad.

34:30.279 --> 34:32.364
Please don't call me mom
in front of the guests.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.411
Did he just call Diane mom?

34:38.745 --> 34:42.416
If he did, that would mean
the boyfriend of the girl I like

34:42.498 --> 34:45.085
is also the son of the resort owner.

34:45.835 --> 34:49.005
And that's no bueno, amigo.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.342
We're not supposed
to speak Spanish at the resort, remember?
