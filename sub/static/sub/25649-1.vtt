WEBVTT

00:46.254 --> 00:47.297
[dog barking]

00:47.380 --> 00:49.924
Dude, we should've just gone
straight to New York.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.511
Come on, man. He's your dad, all right?
You can handle this.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.348
[Larry] Oh.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.976
There's the man himself.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.770
Does he live down there?

01:01.853 --> 01:05.148
I mean, it's technically his basement. So,
like, he spends a little time down there.

01:06.524 --> 01:09.152
[Larry] He's taking out your little
baby mattress. That's sweet.

01:09.235 --> 01:12.947
No way does he think I'm gonna sleep on
that thing. It looks like it has eczema.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.367
[Larry] There's two sides.
You could just flip it over.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.827
[Ben chuckles]

01:22.290 --> 01:24.709
Great, dude. Now he's texting me. [scoffs]

01:26.336 --> 01:27.295
It's gonna be okay,

01:27.378 --> 01:29.464
I'm gonna go in there with you,
all right? Come on.

01:33.092 --> 01:33.927
Hey, Dad.

01:34.010 --> 01:37.680
Hey, Ben. I was just texting you.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.058
-Look at this kid. My college graduate.
-Aw, yeah.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.727
Get in here! I'm so proud of you, man.

01:42.811 --> 01:43.812
[laughs]

01:43.895 --> 01:47.690
-Hey, uh, did you get those Q-tips?
-No, we were already here.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.442
Ah.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.946
-Sort of a 911 situation with my ears.
-Well...

01:53.029 --> 01:55.240
Hey, what about the, uh, six-pack?
Any news?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.325
We were already here, Dad. So...

01:57.408 --> 01:59.160
-Ah, you fucked me. I'm kiddin' ya.
-Yeah.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.329
-Who is this asshole?
-Hey!

02:01.412 --> 02:03.957
Lawrence, I know you.
Got any Q-tips on you?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.125
Nope, I don't.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.334
Nothing in the car?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.710
I don't carry Q-tips.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.003
We'll figure it out.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.883
Here we are. So, valetutorian?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.760
[stutters] Wait, what is that again?

02:15.844 --> 02:20.265
Valedictorian. It means that Ben
was the smartest kid in our whole school.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.767
Of Western New Hampshire College.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.269
It's like being a turd in a urinal.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.645
Don't always downplay it, okay?

02:25.728 --> 02:27.564
You're smarter
than those Ivy League pricks,

02:27.647 --> 02:30.108
and you came from nothing,
just complete shit.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.280
Hey, now why didn't I get
invited to the graduation?

02:35.363 --> 02:36.865
Oh, no parents were invited, Dad.

02:37.782 --> 02:38.908
Did your mother go?

02:39.492 --> 02:40.326
No.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.703
She fuckin' went!

02:41.786 --> 02:43.246
-What the fuck, Ben?
-No...

02:43.329 --> 02:46.791
I didn't invite her, all right? She just
had a layover from her flight to Antigua

02:46.875 --> 02:49.502
with the Cirque du Soleil guy,
and they just showed up.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.381
Mr. O'Malley, I love that you still have
the patio furniture on the inside.

02:53.464 --> 02:56.175
Yeah, Larry, that's a good eye.
It's indoor-outdoor.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.678
I appreciate the flexibility
it affords me.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.889
Speaking of that, uh,
how's the work search going?

03:00.972 --> 03:05.894
Oh, that. That's actually not going well.
It's 'cause of my disability.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.438
Being colorblind is not a disability.

03:08.521 --> 03:12.233
I told a black joke to a black guy.
It's a disability.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.402
It could certainly lead to a disability.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.613
You know, Lawrence, I was thinking,

03:16.696 --> 03:20.658
if everyone was colorblind,
maybe we'd all get along better.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.745
Wow, that was actually...
That makes a lot of sense.

03:23.828 --> 03:27.081
It does? I don't even know what I said.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.918
I think that was an accident.
What did you say?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.461
I... You... It was what you said.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.172
-I got a surprise for you. Follow me.
-Okay.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.138
[laughing]

03:42.222 --> 03:43.181
Whoo!

03:43.264 --> 03:47.018
Oh, this is nice! [laughs]
Get in here, you pussies.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.062
I didn't bring a bathing suit, so...

03:49.145 --> 03:50.313
Problem solved.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.439
What are you doing?

03:51.522 --> 03:52.732
-Dad, leave 'em on.
-Oh, no.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.275
This is a good one.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.652
Ugh!

03:55.735 --> 03:58.279
It's got the netting inside.
Hugs your nuts. It's nice.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.364
Cool.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.365
What about you?

04:00.448 --> 04:03.576
Yeah, I don't want your beanbag
floating into me, so I'm good.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.704
Dude, your whole body came flying
out of my dick at one point.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.123
Now you're scared of it?
That's hysterical.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.626
It ain't gonna suck you back in. Relax.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.754
Larry, make yourself useful.
Get my little Jacuzzi jets over there.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.172
Let's get the party going.

04:16.881 --> 04:19.634
So, what's the valeclitorian
doing tonight? You're going drinking?

04:19.717 --> 04:21.636
We're going to the Roadhouse.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.846
Fuck the Roadhouse! Go to the Wombat!

04:23.930 --> 04:26.099
Dad, the Wombat's been closed
for ten years.

04:26.182 --> 04:29.269
You think I give a fuck?
You don't know me very well.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.731
Well, this seems really dangerous.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.150
So have fun celebrating, boys.

04:36.234 --> 04:40.071
You worked your asses off. You deserve it.
We'll just meet back here tonight.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.323
Actually, I think we're gonna stay
at PJ's tonight.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.783
Who the fuck is PJ?

04:44.450 --> 04:46.327
The Christian Science kid, Dad.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.955
You used to whip batteries at him,
and tell him Christ did it.

04:49.580 --> 04:53.084
That kid? You'd rather hang out
with a scientist than me?

04:53.167 --> 04:55.128
Yeah, it's just easier, Dad,

04:55.211 --> 04:56.754
we're only staying for a couple weeks.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.506
You're only here a couple weeks?

04:58.589 --> 05:01.009
Yeah, Larry and I are off to New York.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.094
I got that job at ISG.
I told you about this.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.014
You'd be proud. He got picked out of,
like, 2,000 applicants.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.975
Well, that's great. That is great.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.103
New York's so fucking far.
You got a job there?

05:12.186 --> 05:13.855
Uh, no... Not at the moment, no.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.024
The fuck you going for?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.527
I don't know. I've just never been before.
It'd be something new.

05:19.610 --> 05:24.115
Goddamn. Give him some room, dude.
Let him breathe. You're smothering him.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.660
-Oh, shit. Is that the lady?
-Yeah, it's the lady.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.287
-She owns the truck. Hide!
-What?

05:29.370 --> 05:30.830
It's her truck.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.266
Stop.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.351
What's happ--

05:55.104 --> 05:56.606
Oh!

05:58.858 --> 06:00.610
[grunts]

06:00.693 --> 06:03.613
[groans] Oh, my God!

06:06.157 --> 06:09.452
-Whoa, what's up, guys?
-Hey, welcome home.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.039
Nathan, buddy.
What's with the new look?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.791
He's trying to join a biker gang.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.417
Oh, shit. You can ride a motorcycle?

06:16.501 --> 06:17.919
I'm learning.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.463
Aren't biker gangs super racist though?

06:20.546 --> 06:23.716
Well, so far these guys are really nice.
No signs of that.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.551
What's up with you, PJ?

06:25.635 --> 06:28.179
I accidentally looked down my mom's shirt
the other day.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.098
-It happens.
-It's no big deal.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.309
I'm pretty sure it was by accident,
but I'm not 100% sure.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.978
So, I'm gonna get
psychologically analyzed.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.688
Okay.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.898
I gotta find out.

06:38.981 --> 06:42.902
-You trying to grow a mustache?
-No, I've grown a mustache.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.238
I'm surprised you guys
can even recognize me.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.406
-Who wants shots?
-Yes!

06:47.490 --> 06:48.658
-Me, too.
-Yeah.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.828
[Ben] Six bucks a shot?
That's fuckin' bullshit.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.832
You know what else is bullshit?
How expensive condoms are.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.876
Yeah, I can't afford to have
consistent sex right now.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.795
Oh, yeah, money's the reason.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.214
[PJ] It is, dude. 100%.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.549
[Larry] That looks pretty good.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.884
You know what you can do?
You can get latex gloves,

07:06.968 --> 07:10.430
'cause they are pretty much the same price
and then you can use 'em five times.

07:11.722 --> 07:15.226
Wait, are you even allowed
to use condoms in Christian Science? Fuck, yeah, we can. Just not for sex.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.982
Come on, guys. Let's go.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.358
[Ben] "Come on. Let's go."

07:23.860 --> 07:26.529
Hey, what... Oh, my... What...

07:27.321 --> 07:28.739
Ben O'Malley?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.450
Meredith Parker!

07:30.533 --> 07:32.618
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, holy shit!

07:32.702 --> 07:34.412
Well... You were my first kiss.

07:34.495 --> 07:37.248
Yeah, yeah, in sixth grade.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.916
You would Myspace me at night

07:39.000 --> 07:41.836
-and then run and hide from me at school.
-Yeah.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.880
We were boyfriend and girlfriend
for two months,

07:43.963 --> 07:46.716
and then we kissed
and you just never talked to me again.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.050
Real nice, Ben.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.804
Come on. I was so embarrassed.
Remember you were much taller?

07:51.888 --> 07:55.808
Wait, do you remember how that old lady
thought you were my baby brother?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.102
Yes. Oh, my...
I should have kissed you then.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.606
That would have really freaked her out.
Anyway, you look great.

08:01.689 --> 08:06.027
Yeah, I grew up a little bit, just stopped
cutting my hair like Dora the Explorer...

08:06.110 --> 08:07.820
-Started wearing makeup.
-So did he.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.781
He got you, dude.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.826
Yeah. Good one, guys. I have a bad zit.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.079
You know, I was thinking it looks
a little cakey. Is that Estée Lauder?

08:17.788 --> 08:19.457
CoverGirl, actually.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.917
Okay. What shade did you use?

08:21.542 --> 08:22.835
Light nude, I think it was.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.087
Looks good on you. Yeah.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340
-Hey, do you wanna split a drink?
-Um...

08:27.965 --> 08:29.050
I should probably get going.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.511
I have my first day of work
tomorrow at Postmates.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.638
It's like the Uber of delivery.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.516
Wow. Well, I don't know if you know this,

08:36.599 --> 08:39.560
but we never actually, like,
officially did the breakup.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.230
Which means that
we're still technically dating.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.565
-No!
-Yes, I know.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.192
I've cheated on you a lot.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.610
-Oh, no.
-Sorry.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.737
Oh, man, I've been nothing but loyal.

08:49.820 --> 08:53.032
This is just not working.
I think we're done.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.493
Oh, well, it's good to have some closure.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.538
Well, I'll see you in, like,
another eight years?

08:58.621 --> 09:01.123
Okay, yeah,
or you can give me your number.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.416
Forty-three.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.126
I'm still gonna call it.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.468
Sweet meeting you.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.887
Yeah. That was a lot of fun.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.684
She just grabbed you
and started kissing you?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.519
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.898
Last time a random girl just grabbed me,
she was falling down the stairs.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.692
Oh!

09:28.734 --> 09:31.153
Dude, if that guy came over here
and tried to fight you,

09:31.237 --> 09:33.114
-what would you do?
-That guy's a Marine, dude.

09:33.197 --> 09:37.076
I wouldn't do anything. I would
take my beating like a true American.

09:37.159 --> 09:37.994
What would you do?

09:38.077 --> 09:39.912
-I'd probably blow him first...
-Mmm, yeah.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.122
...and then take my beating.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.292
Hey, who would you fight?

09:45.251 --> 09:47.628
-I don't know. I wouldn't fight anybody.
-Yeah.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.879
Actually, I take that back.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.423
-I'd fight PJ.
-Yeah.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.425
And your dad. I'd totally fight your dad.

09:52.508 --> 09:56.137
No way, dude. Wayne would kick your ass.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.055
He still gets into fights to this day.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.183
We just watched your dad
fall out of the back of a truck naked.

10:01.267 --> 10:05.146
It looked like a premature baby bird
shooting out of the birth canal.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.857
Let me put it this way.
My dad looks like a human Muppet

10:07.940 --> 10:10.151
and I'm 100% sure
he could kick your dad's ass.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.404
Come on.
Your dad gets startled by pop-up books.

10:13.487 --> 10:16.032
Well, your dad
looks like a big fifth grader.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.409
When he goes to the mall,
how many people ask if he's lost?

10:18.492 --> 10:20.494
Your dad listens to Susan Boyle.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.496
She's actually very talented.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.667
All right!
Here we are hanging with the boys!

10:26.751 --> 10:30.421
Huh? Oh, God! The boys
are back in town, huh?

10:30.504 --> 10:32.214
Up high! Here it is.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.760
Kind of feels like high school again,
huh, guys, right?

10:35.843 --> 10:38.137
Mardy, please turn on the humidifier.

10:38.220 --> 10:42.808
You bet I can.
All right, Aiden, coming around to it.

10:42.892 --> 10:47.396
We're gonna be breathing easy. Right?
Let's fire this baby up.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.190
Yo, you better be nice
to your stepbrother,

10:49.273 --> 10:51.067
because your dad
is leaving him everything.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.735
Not if I drown him in his eggs.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.782
Okay. Sorry, just gonna
swap out the water here, guys.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.950
I think we got a bit of an issue...

11:02.745 --> 11:03.746
Aiden?

11:06.290 --> 11:08.542
Did you urinate in my humidifier?

11:08.626 --> 11:11.545
I don't think so,
but I might have by mistake.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.174
-Come on, man!
-That's disgusting, dude.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.761
You gotta quit it with the pranks, bud.
Okay? You've got to quit it.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.722
I can't even relax in my own home
'cause I'm always looking for something.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.309
Would you like it
if I urinated in your water pistol, hmm?

11:25.393 --> 11:27.311
And then squirted you in the face with it?

11:27.395 --> 11:30.773
Mardy, he's eight!
He was trying to be funny!

11:32.024 --> 11:34.944
[chuckles nervously] I know. So was I.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.655
That's all, you know.

11:37.738 --> 11:42.243
Aiden, you know your stepdaddy
was just trying to make a funny, too.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.702
Whatever.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.996
Dude, your dad just backed down
to an eight-year-old.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.416
-You really think he'd kick Wayne's ass?
-Yes.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.794
Dad, if you got into a fight
with Ben's dad,

11:51.877 --> 11:53.462
you would totally mop the floor with him.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.757
Why would I wanna fight Ben's dad?
I would never wanna do that.

11:56.841 --> 11:57.925
I think you'd lose.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.094
Yeah, all right, let's, you know...

12:00.177 --> 12:02.346
You need two hands to open a fridge.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.806
[chuckling]

12:03.889 --> 12:06.100
Well, that's not... I mean,

12:06.183 --> 12:09.645
it's a very strong suction
on a fridge, bud. Okay?

12:09.728 --> 12:14.483
And so, that's how the door stays sealed
and the food stays cold.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.901
I know what a fridge does.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.696
Aiden, go brush your teeth,
and Mommy will be up in a minute.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.990
I'm sleeping with Mom tonight.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.909
Yeah, you should.
No, she's your mom.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.079
[stutters] I'll take the pullout couch.
Good night, peanut.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.041
Dad, tell them
about how you took out that flasher.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.210
Oh, Larry, that was a long time ago.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.171
What's this story? I want to hear.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.631
All right, fine. Um...

12:38.382 --> 12:40.760
I don't know when that was.
I think that was...

12:41.635 --> 12:44.722
I don't know, maybe, that was when
you were in middle school, Larr, right?

12:44.805 --> 12:48.267
You were in middle school,
and, uh, there was a communal terror

12:48.350 --> 12:52.938
that was roaming the streets.
The Flasher of Fitzpatrick Park.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.150
Now, this guy would hide
on Old River Road, right?

12:56.233 --> 12:58.569
And he would jump out of the bushes

12:58.652 --> 13:02.865
and dingle his very,
very oversized scrotum

13:02.948 --> 13:07.328
at any car that he thought
had a woman in it, okay?

13:07.411 --> 13:11.499
Well, now let's just say,
he flashed the wrong Miata that day.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.833
[Larry chuckles]

13:12.917 --> 13:14.668
So, he thought you were a woman?

13:14.752 --> 13:16.170
'Cause you were driving a Miata.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.508
No. I mean, the body style of Miata
is not the most masculine,

13:20.591 --> 13:23.969
but it's very unisex.
I think everybody can agree on that.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.722
-So, I don't know why he got confused.
-[Krystal] Mmm.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.182
We just told you.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.185
Anyway, I pulled over.

13:31.268 --> 13:35.356
I got out of my car
and I punched him straight in the nose.

13:35.439 --> 13:40.027
Knocked him out for the ten count.
He was never to flash again.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.655
Boom! See? So, you would win, right?

13:42.738 --> 13:45.032
Well, I wasn't exactly saying that.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.368
Come on, Mardy. I won't
get my feelings hurt, say it.

13:48.619 --> 13:53.874
Well, yes, I would take him down. Hard.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.086
Of course I'd kick his ass.
Who is his dad again?

13:57.169 --> 13:58.879
Uh, Mardy. With a "D." Mardy.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.759
-Mardy with a "D"? Okay, I'm scared.
-He lives in that white house on Maple.

14:03.842 --> 14:06.929
It doesn't ring a bell,
but he sounds like a pussy.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.139
Well, both him and Larry think he'd win.

14:11.058 --> 14:11.976
I'm sorry?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.186
No, don't make this a whole thing, please.

14:14.270 --> 14:18.357
It's very interesting.
Who do you think would win in a fight?

14:19.817 --> 14:22.027
Well, um, he's a lot bigger than you.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.822
Uh, he'd be sober, which is a huge plus.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.409
Um, I think it'd be close,
but I think you would win.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.618
Close?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.036
Yeah.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.163
Ben, you don't think I can do anything,
do you?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.708
What are you talking about?
I just said I think you would win.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.793
-Well, you said it would be close.
-Yeah!

14:37.877 --> 14:40.588
Have you gone mad?
Do you know how many fights I've been in?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.006
I don't know, 1,000? I've been in six.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.886
Seven, if you count that little dust-up
I had at the used car lot last summer.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.554
Are you talking about the time

14:48.637 --> 14:50.806
you got knocked out
by that inflatable dancing thing?

14:50.890 --> 14:54.768
I didn't know what that fucking thing was,
but I stood my ground and we went at it.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.811
Oh, my God.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.939
Okay, take that away. Six solid fights.
Three and three.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.232
Your record is three and three?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.109
-That's good.
-All right. Good.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.989
-Do you want me to fight him?
-No,

15:07.072 --> 15:08.866
I do not want you
to fight my friend's dad.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.993
You brought it up.
This seems important to you.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.037
-It's not.
-It's a non-issue to me.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.539
You think it'd be close.
I'll smack this guy around.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.790
-No.
-I don't have to.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.627
It's fine with me either way.
I'm not gonna let it ruin my day.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.589
Okay. Good. Don't. Don't let it ruin it.
I gotta pick up some Postmates.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.425
-These are for you. Enjoy the Q-tips.
-Yeah, have fun.

15:33.098 --> 15:38.187
Mardy with a fucking "D."
How about I knock him out with a "K," huh?

15:39.647 --> 15:42.733
Postmating for a girl. That's a new one.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.610
It's the 21st century, man.
Get used to it.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.071
-[Larry] Ah.
-[upbeat music playing on car radio]

15:52.576 --> 15:55.371
All right, good luck.
Just don't be yourself.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.459
PJ? You do Postmates?

16:01.043 --> 16:04.088
Yeah. I got fired from the bait shop
for stealing worms.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.048
You drove past your own apartment?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.425
I was following the GPS, man.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.094
Hey, uh, I'm so sorry, dude,

16:10.177 --> 16:12.930
but I only ordered Postmates
so I can see Meredith.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.100
Uh, can you please return this?
I can't afford any of this, so...

16:16.183 --> 16:17.977
No, man. I really can't do that.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.229
You already purchased it when you ordered.

16:20.312 --> 16:24.441
You could file a complaint,
but that would reflect poorly on me.

16:24.525 --> 16:28.862
So, like, please don't do it, dude.
Just enjoy that orange chicken, bitch.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.614
Fuck!

16:34.910 --> 16:36.787
-Here's your pack of gum.
-Thank you.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.414
Don't spoil your appetite.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.297
Here you go.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.803
I got it started for you.

17:00.728 --> 17:05.107
Whoa! Meredith? Oh, my gosh!
So this is crazy. What are the odds?

17:05.190 --> 17:06.900
Uh, one in nine.

17:06.984 --> 17:11.155
You've used Postmates nine times today.
I saw it on the app. Hi, Larry.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.199
Meredith. Hi.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.702
-Wait, your name's Larry?
-Yeah.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.370
My brother's name's Larry.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.539
-Let's not talk about that.
-Okay.

17:21.957 --> 17:25.836
Hey, so, by the way, the other night,
you gave me a couple of numbers.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.047
I think you left out eight or so.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.923
Not that I'm aware of.

17:30.007 --> 17:30.966
-No?
-Nah.

17:31.050 --> 17:31.967
Well, here's an idea.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.387
I'll give you my phone
and then I will call me sometime.

17:36.096 --> 17:36.930
Okay.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.015
Cool.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.101
[car engine starts] I need my phone!

17:53.155 --> 17:54.323
I'm not that badass

17:54.406 --> 17:56.658
-to pull something off like that.
-I know.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.120
Hey, seriously though,
can I please get your number?

18:01.038 --> 18:05.834
Ben, I'm not gonna be your hometown fling.
But good luck in New York.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.798
All right. Cool. Thank you.
I'll see you around. <i>Hi, this is Meredith.</i>
<i>So, you just gave me your phone,</i>

18:24.561 --> 18:27.231
<i>trying to be all cool, which you're not.</i>

18:27.314 --> 18:29.691
<i>Guaranteed you're going to panic</i>
<i>and come back for it. </i>

18:29.775 --> 18:34.488
<i>Oh, my God, here you are now.</i>
<i>What... Is that a waddle?</i>

18:34.571 --> 18:35.614
Oh, God.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.492
<i>Dude, are your legs different lengths?</i>

18:38.575 --> 18:39.409
<i>Oh.</i>

18:39.493 --> 18:41.495
<i>It's kind of cute, I gotta admit.</i>

19:06.603 --> 19:07.938
Calm down.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.859
It's a non-issue.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.754
My kid's lost all fucking faith in me!

19:46.977 --> 19:48.020
Nice night.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.695
Fuck!

19:59.114 --> 20:01.116
[Larry] You and your gang
just beat up minorities,

20:01.200 --> 20:04.453
and your gang leader says,
"There's even more down the street!"

20:04.536 --> 20:05.913
That's not what we do.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.248
Three, two, one! Go, go, go!

20:09.041 --> 20:09.875
[all] Oh!

20:09.958 --> 20:11.376
-[Nathan] Ow!
-[cell phone rings]

20:11.460 --> 20:14.671
-You're definitely getting somewhere.
-Well, somewhere.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.341
-Hey.
<i>-Benjamin, this is your father.</i>

20:17.424 --> 20:22.638
I got the local weather report.
There's a storm brewing on Maple Street.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.431
<i>Dad, please, no.</i>

20:27.017 --> 20:29.269
Oh, shit, dude.
My dad's at your dad's house.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.437
Let's ride!

20:33.941 --> 20:35.234
-[Larry] Oh!
-[Ben] Oh, shit.

20:35.317 --> 20:39.071
You guys go ahead. I'll pour water
down his throat until he wakes up.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.822
Great idea. I'll drive.

20:40.906 --> 20:45.410
Oh. You did so good.
If only you could have seen yourself.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.624
Does this look like
an eight-year-old made it?

20:51.458 --> 20:54.378
Well, uh, I mean,
I would say a gifted eight-year-old.

20:54.461 --> 20:58.674
When I was eight, I was fascinated
by the reverse osmosis process.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.344
Well, you were a freak!
How long did this take you?

21:02.427 --> 21:08.850
Um, I mean, a little under two weeks,
you know. Probably 36 man-hours.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.269
I mean, I was just trying to help.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.064
Well, his teacher knew you did it,
and now we're those people.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.608
What, the people that get involved
with their children?

21:16.692 --> 21:18.193
I'm proud to be one of those.

21:18.277 --> 21:23.073
He has to redo the assignment!
You owe him an apology, Mardy.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.670
God... damn it, Aiden!

21:36.753 --> 21:37.713
[doorbell rings]

21:47.973 --> 21:49.391
-[Wayne] Ah.
-[Mardy] Ow.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.853
Well, aren't you dressed
like the substitute teacher.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.273
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

21:56.356 --> 21:59.276
Yeah, I'm father... Wayne.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.112
Uh, from Saint Catherine's?

22:02.195 --> 22:04.656
No, I'm Wayne, the father.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.367
The father?

22:07.909 --> 22:08.744
Ben.

22:08.827 --> 22:12.956
-Oh, Ben's father! Yes, of course.
-Fuck.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.042
Nice to see you. What's doing?

22:15.125 --> 22:18.045
I'm here to settle this debate
our kids are having.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.838
What's that? What's the debate?

22:20.422 --> 22:22.507
About which one of us
would win in a fight.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.010
[chuckles] Right.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.972
I'm sorry. You want to fight me?

22:29.598 --> 22:32.476
Nah, I don't really,
but I feel like it's best if I did. I don't know if you know,
my kid fucking hates my guts!

22:35.520 --> 22:37.272
I think there's been
some misunderstanding.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.607
I would never fight you.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.234
Eh, what's the big deal?
Don't be a fuckin' puss.

22:41.318 --> 22:45.405
Fight today, friends tomorrow.
Winner buys the loser a brew.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.658
Dad, stop! Whatever you're about to do,
please don't.

22:48.742 --> 22:52.162
All hail the valit... valitorian is here.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.747
Mr. O'Malley, we were messing around.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.791
We don't really care about
you guys fighting.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.293
I think you do.
And we're gonna do this right now.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.295
You got five seconds to swing at me first.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.589
-No, I said I don't-- [screams]
-Five, four, three, two--

23:02.672 --> 23:04.800
-And the gazelle flees.
-Dad!

23:05.509 --> 23:06.968
[Mardy whimpering]

23:12.682 --> 23:14.601
-Ow!
-Whoa!

23:15.811 --> 23:17.104
This isn't funny anymore! What's your problem, guy?

23:18.563 --> 23:21.441
Dad, Dad, please don't do this.
You're drunk.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.653
-You know what? You're right. Come here!
-[Mardy] You're a lunatic!

23:24.736 --> 23:27.489
-[Mardy] You psycho!
-I've never seen my dad move that fast.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.950
Aiden! Shelter in place!

23:31.409 --> 23:32.452
[Wayne] Come on!

23:33.578 --> 23:35.372
-Oh, Christ!
-Krystal, call the police!

23:38.333 --> 23:42.087
You gotta calm down, Mardy.
You're setting a bad example for the kids.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.297
[Mardy gasping]

23:46.716 --> 23:47.801
Oh, shit!

23:47.884 --> 23:49.261
[Mardy panting]

23:50.804 --> 23:52.264
Damn you, chicken shit!

23:53.640 --> 23:54.808
Oh, no.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.352
[groans]

23:59.729 --> 24:00.730
[Wayne] Oh, I got you.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.357
Okay, okay, okay.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.775
Dad!

24:05.652 --> 24:06.611
Fuck.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.614
Look, the police have been called.
This is private property.

24:09.698 --> 24:12.409
It reminds me of a story
I used to tell Benny boy.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.119
<i>Green Eggs and Ham.</i>

24:14.202 --> 24:20.000
I will beat you on the street,
I will beat you with my mouse dick.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.877
-[Ben] Dad!
-Fuck! What is it?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.796
-Get down here, this is fucking insane.
-Fuck, he's coming. Here we go!

24:24.880 --> 24:26.214
-Dad, stop!
-He's psycho!

24:26.298 --> 24:28.133
[both yelling]

24:33.346 --> 24:35.390
[groaning]

24:38.685 --> 24:40.770
[Wayne] Where is that motherfucker?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.532
[grumbles]

24:53.783 --> 24:54.951
[grunting]

24:59.623 --> 25:01.041
Oh, hey.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.793
Oh, fuck, are we in jail?

25:03.877 --> 25:04.836
Yeah.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.795
[sighs]

25:05.879 --> 25:09.925
Dad, you tried to beat up
Larry's dad last night.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.553
Which one's Larry's dad?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.513
Are you fucking serious?

25:15.597 --> 25:19.517
I blacked out. I'm sorry.
I have a low tolerance.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.896
You know, with your one phone call
last night, you called me?

25:22.979 --> 25:26.816
Oh, that actually makes sense,
'cause you're my emergency contact.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.403
Eh, come on, this ain't so bad.

25:30.487 --> 25:34.115
Look, we get to hang a little bit
without your friend Larry around.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.533
What's his angle anyway?

25:35.617 --> 25:39.496
Ben O'Malley, Wayne O'Malley, follow me.

25:40.121 --> 25:43.291
I bet my buddy Deon posted bail.
He's always coming through in a clutch.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.671
No. I got it. I got us a bail bond.
And now I'm in debt, Dad. Thank you.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.632
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.
After a while, they stop keeping track.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.425
What do you say we go hit the Wombat?

25:52.509 --> 25:54.678
The Wombat's fucking closed, Dad!

25:59.474 --> 26:01.685
Get in. Shit.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.318
-What was it like?
-What?

26:11.945 --> 26:14.948
In the clink.
Did you drop my gang's name?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.283
I'm not doing this, okay?

26:16.366 --> 26:17.951
You wanna talk, you can get in the car.

26:18.034 --> 26:21.037
I can't. I gotta practice!

26:21.121 --> 26:23.623
-[tires screech]
-[cell phone ringing]

26:24.249 --> 26:25.083
This is Ben.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.295
Dude, who answers the phone like that?
[mumbles]

26:28.378 --> 26:31.840
<i>Hi, Ben. It's Ryan Jenkins</i>
<i>from ISG Energy Solutions.</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:33.341
Hi! Hi. How are you?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.927
<i>We got a Google alert this morning</i>
<i>about your arrest. </i>

26:36.011 --> 26:38.013
<i>We have to terminate </i>
<i>your employment offer.</i>

26:38.096 --> 26:39.180
What?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.599
<i>We have a strict conduct policy.</i>
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

26:41.683 --> 26:43.226
I didn't do anything. It was my dad.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.811
<i>-Yeah, good luck.</i>
-Please.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.981
What happened?

26:48.064 --> 26:49.733
They fucking fired me.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.234
Oh, shit.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.486
Those fucking bastards.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.739
Hey, they're looking for somebody
at the bait shop

26:55.822 --> 26:57.240
if you know how to sell worms.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.616
I'm so screwed.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.951
-I'm fucking screwed.
-No, look.

27:00.910 --> 27:03.997
You're all good.
We are going to fix this.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.290
[sighs]

27:05.957 --> 27:07.917
-[thudding]
-[groans]

27:09.544 --> 27:10.503
Oh.

27:10.587 --> 27:14.007
Let's just go. I'll come back
in a few hours. He'll still be there.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.177
Later, Nathan.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.516
You know, it was very expensive.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.770
I can only imagine. I am so sorry.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.646
But I was getting rid of it anyway.

27:28.730 --> 27:29.814
Oh, that's perfect.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.900
Do you think you'd be willing
to drop the charges,

27:31.983 --> 27:34.778
since Ben kind of did the demo for you?

27:34.861 --> 27:37.072
I've been wanting a pool for my grandkids.

27:37.155 --> 27:40.784
You get me a pool, I'll drop the charges.
That's a great idea.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.036
I'm sorry.
I don't have that kind of money.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.621
No, I want you to build it!

27:44.704 --> 27:47.707
How about a birdbath?
Ben could build you a birdbath.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.626
Why? I don't have any fucking birds.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.879
I'm sorry, but I really don't think
I'll be able to build a swimming pool.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.130
I don't know where to start.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.467
Honestly, I don't think anybody
really knows how to build a swimming pool.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.552
If anyone could figure it out,
it's Ben though.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.637
-You just shut up?
-PJ!

28:00.720 --> 28:03.390
It's okay, don't worry about it.
Enjoy your summer.

28:03.473 --> 28:05.183
So you'll drop the charges?

28:05.266 --> 28:07.310
No, I don't think so.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.355
Okay. A pool it is.
That's what we'll do.

28:10.438 --> 28:12.607
Ah, my grandchildren will be thrilled!

28:14.109 --> 28:16.694
Eh, you just dig a fuckin' hole
and fill it with water.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.071
Right? Easy enough.

28:18.947 --> 28:22.242
It's gonna be good, dude.
I'm stoked about it.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.204
Can it wait a few minutes?

28:26.955 --> 28:28.623
What is this weird voice
you're doing, Dad?

28:28.706 --> 28:30.542
You sound like a guidance counselor.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.794
Why are you gulping?

28:34.754 --> 28:37.882
All right, all right.
I will see you in an hour. Bye.

28:37.966 --> 28:41.052
I'd help with the pool, but I don't think
our visions are the same, man.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.470
We'd probably butt heads.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.722
Don't sweat it, man.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.850
Fuck! It's Meredith.
What is she doing here?

28:47.767 --> 28:51.104
This is her dad's store.
How did you not know that?

28:51.187 --> 28:54.399
Oh, shit, man. I can't tell her
I got arrested and fucking fired.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.900
Now I'm building a pool.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.318
So don't tell her.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.779
But she'll see me
holding the shovel, Larry.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.700
That connects to you getting arrested?

29:03.783 --> 29:06.661
Connects to me
building the pool, assholes.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.621
There's no way.
Just say you have a shovel.

29:08.705 --> 29:09.789
Shut up, Dynamite. Oh, fuck, dude.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.209
I'm not a good liar.
You guys cover for me. Take it.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.210
-What?
-Take it!

29:14.294 --> 29:15.879
-Are you serious?
-What?

29:15.962 --> 29:17.088
Oh, come...

29:20.925 --> 29:23.470
-Hey, guys.
-[PJ] What? Meredith?

29:23.553 --> 29:26.473
-Whoa.
-Hey. So you just shoveling some shit?

29:26.556 --> 29:29.934
Oh, no. Just getting a head start
on digging my dad's grave.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.186
Oh.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.104
Hey, uh, how's your boyfriend Ben doing?

29:33.188 --> 29:36.775
Doing great. Killing it.
Yeah, he's in New York.

29:36.858 --> 29:41.279
Started his new job early.
Saving the planet, making good money.

29:41.905 --> 29:42.906
That's great.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.325
He just bought a Bugatti and a watch.

29:45.408 --> 29:49.078
It's an expensive Bugatti
and an even more expensive watch.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.580
He's got tons of women chasing him.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.791
Tons. He's engaged.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.292
Oh, really?

29:54.375 --> 29:57.253
And she's Elijah Wood's cousin.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.923
Yeah. So she's paying his rent.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.299
What the fuck are you guys--

30:04.719 --> 30:06.971
-Whoa!
-Holy shit.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.558
Uh, what's up?

30:11.267 --> 30:14.354
Uh, just this. Um...

30:14.437 --> 30:16.231
How come you're not in New York?

30:17.023 --> 30:17.941
Um...

30:19.108 --> 30:22.570
I body slammed my dad
off a roof into a greenhouse.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.323
And then they arrested us.
And then I lost my job.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.033
Did you have to go to jail?

30:27.867 --> 30:29.244
For a night.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.704
That's kind of hot.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.581
Yeah, isn't it?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.501
I started selling cigarettes.
I had to stab a guy.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.169
Okay, don't make up shit.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.587
-It was hot before.
-Oh.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.089
Hot enough to give me your number?

30:41.172 --> 30:44.634
No. But hot enough to give you two more.
A five and a one.

30:45.510 --> 30:49.681
He'll figure that out, man.
The valedi-torian knows every combination.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.599
And, uh, just in case I can't,

30:51.683 --> 30:53.393
I'll leave my number in the comment box.

30:53.476 --> 30:57.188
So, look for the ones
with all the smiley faces on it.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.315
You don't wanna leave your number here. You fucked this place up, dude.

31:00.984 --> 31:01.860
That's a good point.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.444
-Yeah.
-Let's go. [grunts]

31:11.327 --> 31:12.579
Hello?

31:12.662 --> 31:15.373
[Mardy] Yeah, we're up here.
In Aiden's room.

31:15.456 --> 31:18.293
-Well, your... The boys' room.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.004
You know, the first door on the right.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.849
He's wearing my jersey.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.977
What happened to my pictures?

31:36.060 --> 31:39.230
Aiden doesn't like you staring at him
while he's trying to sleep.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.607
You gotta be shitting me.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.900
What does "shit" mean, Mommy?

31:41.983 --> 31:44.319
Oh, fuck that, man!
He knows what "shit" means.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.737
-Larry!
-What?

31:45.820 --> 31:48.156
He's probably got
30 different words for "twat."

31:48.239 --> 31:49.324
That one I don't know.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.285
That attitude is exactly why you're here.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.456
We're having an intervention
because we love you, but we're also very concerned.
Please, have a seat.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.503
[scoffs] Oh, this is ridiculous.

32:02.587 --> 32:03.963
No, it's not.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.591
Larry, we can all see
you're off right now.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.470
I've been off myself, too.
After Aiden's dad got out of jail...

32:10.553 --> 32:11.638
He's out of jail?

32:11.721 --> 32:16.017
I lashed out. I made some questionable
investments with your father's money.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.896
It affected the whole family.
Your father got back on caffeine.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.982
You know what happens
when I have too much energy.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.734
It was hard for us.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.903
But I still remained loving.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.822
Your actions seem to be coming
from a dark place.

32:29.906 --> 32:30.949
This isn't my fault.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.662
Larry, you provoked a mad man
into trying to fight me.

32:35.745 --> 32:36.955
No, I didn't.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.667
You need to start taking responsibility
for your actions, okay?

32:40.750 --> 32:43.836
And it's time you start thinking
about your future.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.588
I will, when I get to New York.

32:45.672 --> 32:49.092
No, Ben is going to New York
for his career.

32:49.175 --> 32:53.262
No one knows why you're going.
I mean, the whole neighborhood's confused.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.639
You don't even have a job.

32:54.722 --> 32:59.602
Exactly. You're just gonna be drifting
and floating and hanging out

32:59.686 --> 33:02.438
with those Brooklyn crackhead hipsters.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.900
Who also don't have jobs, only beards.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.736
You need to get a life of your own.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.238
I don't know what I want in my life.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.992
I'm 22, Dad. I'm lost. Can you can give me
the weekend to figure it out?

33:14.075 --> 33:15.827
Maybe you could do gay porn.

33:15.910 --> 33:21.416
Aiden! Or maybe he could work
at the lab with you.

33:22.709 --> 33:27.755
Well, now, I hadn't thought of that.
What a fantastic idea, Krystal.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.384
Am I supposed to pretend
you guys didn't rehearse this?

33:31.467 --> 33:35.888
So, it's settled.
You'll work with me in the lab tomorrow.

33:35.972 --> 33:36.931
Then you'll stay at home

33:37.015 --> 33:39.267
until you figure out
what to do with your life.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.351
Great.

33:44.564 --> 33:48.026
I taste piss. Aiden, do I taste piss?

33:48.109 --> 33:49.902
I honestly don't remember.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.654
Okay, it seems like you'd remember

33:51.738 --> 33:54.449
if you whipped your penis out
and pissed in my cup.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.451
Mmm, can't help you.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.704
<i>You may have noticed the transit </i>
<i>in some of our shots...</i>

33:59.787 --> 34:00.955
<i>...laying out the pool.</i>

34:01.039 --> 34:04.042
<i>-But the coating would finish...</i>
-Jesus! What are you talking about?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.877
<i>...top of the gunite, which is the...</i>

34:05.960 --> 34:07.462
What the fuck is "gunite"?

34:07.545 --> 34:10.339
<i>...relative to the foundation</i>
<i>of the house.</i>

34:10.423 --> 34:11.841
<i>So what we have is...</i>

34:11.924 --> 34:15.219
<i>We have what's called the weep screed,</i>
<i>or a mud sill.</i>

34:15.303 --> 34:16.471
[sighs]

34:16.554 --> 34:20.475
Ben! Did you wash your hands
after you used the restroom?

34:20.558 --> 34:21.893
Always do.

34:22.602 --> 34:26.105
This once was a mermaid.
Now it looks like Jay Leno.

34:26.189 --> 34:28.357
I'm sorry.
I didn't see any other soap in there.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.068
I thought I was supposed to use that one.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.861
Should he ask next time?

34:31.944 --> 34:36.282
Yes, he should, Paisley.
Stop taking so many dumps.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.117
Okay.

34:44.874 --> 34:45.958
Where's the pool?

34:46.042 --> 34:49.170
Your church friend with the scumstache
said you built a pool.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.671
This is it.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.133
This is it? This grass?

34:54.884 --> 34:57.136
This is far from being a fucking pool.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.096
Are you drinking?

34:59.305 --> 35:01.224
Instant breakfast.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.559
Listen, I feel terrible
about what happened with that gig,

35:03.643 --> 35:05.269
you losing it. You need any help?

35:05.353 --> 35:07.855
If I needed to fill balloons
with bad breath, you could help.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.190
But I don't, so I'm good.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.110
Remember how deep I dug that grave
for your guinea pig?

35:12.193 --> 35:14.195
Made sure my snake
didn't have a second go at him.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.658
Well, that shit's like
<i>Flintstone</i> boulders down there.

35:18.741 --> 35:19.951
You need better equipment.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.537
Yeah? You gonna give me the $800 I need?

35:23.830 --> 35:28.042
I might... win up to 50 grand.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.754
Oh, here we go. Cross your fingers.

35:32.421 --> 35:36.926
Oh, fuck! One away from a Diet Dr. Pepper.
That's how they get you.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.428
You know what, Dad?
You can't fucking help me. All right?

35:39.512 --> 35:41.472
So you go do your thing. I'll be fine.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.105
Goddamn!

35:50.189 --> 35:53.401
I can't believe
making nipples soft is a job.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.989
Ah. Yeah, well, the embarrassment
from inappropriate nipple reaction

35:58.072 --> 35:59.782
is a real problem.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.535
It can happen at inconvenient times.

36:02.618 --> 36:06.539
Like, when you meet someone and you think
they're gonna look different,

36:06.622 --> 36:10.418
but they're actually quite well-built.

36:14.255 --> 36:18.551
You know, Mardy and Krystal
are always talking about you.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.095
-Really?
-Yes!

36:22.388 --> 36:24.932
They think you are very bright, Aiden.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.143
I'm Larry.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.769
Oh. Oh.

36:30.897 --> 36:35.026
They are so proud of you, too.
They are.

36:35.109 --> 36:37.987
See how they have all your old pictures
up on the wall?

36:38.070 --> 36:40.990
That's not me.
Glad he's so happy, though.

36:41.073 --> 36:44.160
Never seen him smile so hard.
Thought he was a blind singer.

36:44.243 --> 36:45.203
[both chuckle]

36:47.914 --> 36:51.167
You know, to me,
legalization was a negative, man. Half the fun of weed is knowing
I shouldn't be doing it. Am I right, bud?

36:54.587 --> 36:55.963
Yeah, that's true.

36:56.047 --> 37:00.092
Ah, sorry. I'm fucking nervous.
What are they gonna do to us in there?

37:00.176 --> 37:01.636
I don't know. It can't be dangerous

37:01.719 --> 37:03.930
'cause if it was, they'd be paying us
more than $40.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.015
Hey, 40's nothing to sneeze at.

37:06.098 --> 37:08.768
I can't remember the last time
I had 40 cash on me.

37:08.851 --> 37:09.727
[chuckles]

37:09.810 --> 37:12.313
I'm trying to help out my kid.
He's in a bit of a jam.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.274
Kids. Nine months of living in the mama,

37:15.358 --> 37:17.568
the rest of their lives,
living off their papa.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.321
Oh, shit, I've never heard that one!
[laughs]

37:21.030 --> 37:22.949
Oh, I got a knee slapper for you.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.243
These two black guys...

37:25.326 --> 37:28.871
Wait a second. There's no black guys
in here, are there?

37:28.955 --> 37:30.665
Gentlemen, follow me please.

37:30.748 --> 37:34.210
I'll tell you the rest of that one later.
Time to go make some bread.

37:41.384 --> 37:44.178
Oh, shit. Mr. O'Malley,
what are you doing here?

37:44.262 --> 37:45.763
Oh, hello, Lawrence.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.766
I'm here to get Ben out of the jam
that you instigated.

37:48.849 --> 37:51.852
Ah, gentlemen, thank you so much
for coming. My name is Mardy Fischer.

37:51.936 --> 37:52.937
Oh, my God. You okay?

37:58.609 --> 37:59.694
Uh...

38:00.778 --> 38:02.196
What's going on?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.490
Hello?

38:05.074 --> 38:06.075
You don't remember him?

38:06.158 --> 38:07.285
This guy?

38:08.452 --> 38:09.996
What are you? Famous?

38:10.079 --> 38:12.498
I... I don't... You don't?

38:12.581 --> 38:14.000
No, I don't. I'm sorry.

38:14.083 --> 38:17.837
Are you some big scientist
on the SyFy Channel or something?

38:17.920 --> 38:19.630
So you don't recognize me at all?

38:19.714 --> 38:22.925
No, I don't recognize you,
or I would have told you.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.802
Is there a fucking problem, dickface?

38:24.885 --> 38:27.179
No. No problem at all.
No problem at all.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.765
I will, uh, be with you all
in just one moment.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.309
Yeah. Goddamn.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.060
What the hell is going on?

38:33.144 --> 38:36.314
He blacked out. He was drunk that night.
He's not drunk now, so everything's good.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.398
Fuck you.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.233
He's a lot bigger than I remember.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.235
Relax! Let's just get him
in and out of here.

38:42.445 --> 38:43.446
Okay.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.906
[sighs] Disgusting.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.701
-Did you shit yourself again?
-A little bit.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.419
Okay. Next person.
Now apply some more cream.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.796
No, Larry. A liberal amount.

39:01.547 --> 39:04.050
Yeah, really cover the nipple, okay?
The entire areola.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.469
Dad, why can't they do this themselves?

39:06.552 --> 39:08.554
What would be the fun in that?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.979
Olivia, what are you doing in line?

39:17.855 --> 39:21.525
Oh, uh, is there not enough cream?

39:23.694 --> 39:25.988
Uh... sorry.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.201
Let's go, lover boy.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.329
Go slow, I got butterflies.

39:36.248 --> 39:37.166
Oh.

39:40.836 --> 39:42.588
Oh. Boing!

39:42.671 --> 39:44.256
Okay, now the wind test.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.681
No, no.
I need you to use your mouth.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.351
Yeah.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.269
You heard him.
Get down there.

40:02.817 --> 40:04.485
[blowing]

40:08.447 --> 40:10.157
Don't fall for me.
I'll break your heart.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.076
Fuck you.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.372
Ow.

40:16.455 --> 40:20.668
Okay, something's happening. All right.
It's burning. Is that normal?

40:20.751 --> 40:22.461
Uh, are you allergic to anything?

40:22.545 --> 40:24.004
No. Just herpes, I think.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.381
What the...

40:25.464 --> 40:27.341
This is starting to feel like
knives in there.

40:27.425 --> 40:31.470
Like, it's poking. Like, it's burning.
What did you fucking do to me? Ow.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.306
They're fucking burning like shit!

40:34.390 --> 40:36.976
No one's helping!
What the fuck happened?

40:37.059 --> 40:39.353
Get a fire extinguisher,
you doofy piece of shit!

40:39.437 --> 40:43.232
I'll fucking kill you! God damn it!
Somebody do something!

40:43.315 --> 40:47.319
Get this shit off! Fuck!
[yelling] It burns! Oh, fuck! Help me, someone!
I'm on fire!

40:51.490 --> 40:52.867
[Wayne] That's Larry's dad?

40:52.950 --> 40:53.784
[Ben] Yes!

40:53.868 --> 40:55.077
[Wayne] I'm going to fight him.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.580
He gave me fucking tits, dude!

40:57.663 --> 40:59.081
They're not permanent, Dad.

40:59.165 --> 41:02.084
A tit's a tit, Ben. And I got two of them.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.921
On me. Part of me. Do you get it?

41:06.005 --> 41:09.383
For guys to fuck and squeeze and whack on.

41:09.467 --> 41:15.181
Don't let guys do that to you.
Here, just take some allergy medicine.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.557
Give me this shit.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.018
Just slow down. No.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.354
Ugh!

41:24.482 --> 41:28.903
They're still there! Shit.
Now I'm thinking about keeping 'em.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.529
I don't know what to do, Ben.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.324
Don't stare at me like that.
I'm still your father.

41:33.407 --> 41:35.576
Hey, what were you doing
at that lab anyway?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.536
You know what I'm doing there?

41:38.954 --> 41:42.374
I'm trying to make some money
to buy you a jackhammer. There.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.878
There's your check. Here you go.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.464
[exhales sharply]

41:49.632 --> 41:51.175
Wow, uh...

41:51.258 --> 41:54.428
Well, okay. Thank you, thank you...
Thanks a lot.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.638
Yeah, sure.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.723
Can you give the old man a hug?
Would that kill you?

41:58.307 --> 41:59.350
Yeah, sure.

41:59.433 --> 42:03.312
Here ya go, buddy. Come here. Come here.

42:03.979 --> 42:06.649
What? Why are you so rigid when I hug you?

42:06.732 --> 42:09.109
Your boobs are pressed up against me, Dad.
It's really weird.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.529
-You got a boner? I'm your father.
-No. Dad!

42:11.612 --> 42:17.076
Okay. I gotta go. Just stay there
and don't fight Larry's dad.

42:17.451 --> 42:18.994
You're a fucking bore.

42:36.845 --> 42:37.846
[gasps] Oh, my God!

42:41.976 --> 42:43.352
[shushes]

42:47.231 --> 42:48.232
Okay.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.655
[cell phone chimes]

42:56.240 --> 42:57.866
[cell phone chimes]

43:02.663 --> 43:03.872
Psycho.

43:14.049 --> 43:19.346
Why... did you fucking do this to me?

43:19.430 --> 43:20.431
God damn it.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.266
Come on!

43:24.101 --> 43:26.478
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

43:27.229 --> 43:28.063
[yelps]

43:32.526 --> 43:33.527
Fuck!

43:38.741 --> 43:41.452
I think you're supposed to pour
the concrete in

43:41.535 --> 43:42.828
before you fill it with water.

43:42.911 --> 43:44.705
This is impossible.

43:44.788 --> 43:48.459
There's fucking rocks and roots
and dead mailmen everywhere.

43:48.542 --> 43:51.795
Well, you need one of these.

43:52.630 --> 43:53.464
Wow.

43:54.340 --> 43:57.426
Thank you. But no, I...
I don't have the kind of money for that.

43:57.509 --> 43:59.136
Just buy me a drink. We'll call it even.

43:59.219 --> 44:01.847
I don't really have the kind of money
for that either.

44:02.556 --> 44:05.809
Oh, Benjamin. [sighs]
You've got to get your life together.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.149
So, you're here for good, huh?

44:12.232 --> 44:15.653
Uh, at least until I finish
my accounting degree.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.988
I'm gonna help my dad franchise the store.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.282
-Oh, wow. That's really cool.
-Yeah.

44:20.783 --> 44:26.622
Yeah, I'd like to help him retire
at some point. But I like it here.

44:26.705 --> 44:28.540
Yeah, it's funny.
I've lived here my whole life

44:28.624 --> 44:30.292
and I never came to this pond.

44:30.376 --> 44:32.670
You gotta be a tourist
in your own town sometimes.

44:32.753 --> 44:33.837
Yeah, right?

44:33.921 --> 44:36.674
I was so focused on getting good grades,
so that I could get out,

44:36.757 --> 44:38.050
that I never did anything fun.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.302
I didn't go to prom.

44:40.969 --> 44:43.806
You didn't go to prom? What a loser!

44:43.889 --> 44:46.600
No, I went, but I got too drunk.

44:47.434 --> 44:50.229
[giggles] I threw up in the bushes
and they wouldn't let me in.

44:50.312 --> 44:51.939
Oh, I totally remember that.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.190
Oh.

44:53.273 --> 44:55.734
I've done everything else
you're supposed to do in high school.

44:55.818 --> 44:59.530
I jumped off Fitzy's Ledge.
I went skinny-dipping at Livingston.

44:59.613 --> 45:02.032
Oh, I was way too shy
to go skinny-dipping.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.617
You've never gone skinny-dipping?

45:04.159 --> 45:05.327
I'm very insecure.

45:05.411 --> 45:09.373
I can't believe you.
That's the classic high school trope.

45:09.456 --> 45:11.125
-Yeah, well...
-We're going right now.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.627
No, come on. No.

45:13.710 --> 45:14.753
Get ready, buddy.

45:37.693 --> 45:40.237
Okay. Those are way nicer than my dad's.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.321
Thanks.

45:41.905 --> 45:42.948
[exhales heavily]

45:48.704 --> 45:49.538
Yep.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.209
Go slow.

45:58.630 --> 46:02.259
Oh, hey, Ben. I think there's an acorn
caught in your pubes.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.760
Oh, shut up.

46:03.844 --> 46:06.388
Well, I said skinny-dipping,
not mini-dipping.

46:06.472 --> 46:07.681
Okay, I'm gonna cover up.

46:08.390 --> 46:11.351
You probably don't need the
whole box. You could just use the nozzle.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.687
It is so unfair that you
can make fun of my body

46:13.770 --> 46:15.355
and I can't make fun of yours.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.191
I'm just joking.

46:17.274 --> 46:21.111
You have a very nice-looking penis.
It's very, um, approachable.

46:21.195 --> 46:22.029
Approachable?

46:22.112 --> 46:24.865
Yeah, really, like a friendly little guy.

46:24.948 --> 46:27.493
Little guy? Okay. All right.

46:29.203 --> 46:30.621
Ooh.

46:30.704 --> 46:32.706
[sighs] Pretty nice in here, huh?

46:32.789 --> 46:36.710
Yeah. Yeah, this feels awesome.

46:39.004 --> 46:42.216
Hey, you wanna re-enact our first kiss?
You know, see if I got any better?

46:42.299 --> 46:45.886
You're not supposed to ask a girl
if you can kiss her. You just do it.

46:45.969 --> 46:47.429
I knew that. I knew that.

46:47.846 --> 46:50.015
Oh! [coughing]

46:50.098 --> 46:51.058
Wow!

46:51.141 --> 46:53.352
That was even more awkward
than sixth grade.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.855
You don't like awkward? I love awkward.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.232
It's sexy.

46:59.191 --> 47:00.025
[screams]

47:00.108 --> 47:01.276
What?

47:01.360 --> 47:04.696
Um, uh, something just touched my leg.
Something just touched my leg.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.615
Aw, is a little fishy bothering you?

47:07.241 --> 47:10.369
[screaming] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

47:10.452 --> 47:12.287
What? Are you just gonna leave me?

47:12.371 --> 47:15.457
Uh, no. I'm just...
Over here, over here.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.543
-I'm getting him to come to me.
-Oh, my... Whoa!

47:17.626 --> 47:18.585
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:18.669 --> 47:20.754
Oh, God! Something is sucking on my leg.

47:20.837 --> 47:21.964
-Oh--
-Sucking on your leg?

47:22.047 --> 47:25.676
[screaming] God! Oh, my God!
I don't wanna die!

47:28.595 --> 47:29.638

47:36.103 --> 47:37.688
<i>3:01 a.m.</i>

47:37.771 --> 47:41.900
<i>Hey, dude. </i>
<i>Just telling you the titties are gone. </i>

47:41.984 --> 47:45.612
<i>So all is forgiven. </i>
<i>Fun while it lasted. </i>

47:45.696 --> 47:47.573
<i>I took some pics. </i>
<i>Non-issue.</i>

47:48.240 --> 47:50.784
Mardy, come on,
we have to get to Aiden's pottery class.

47:50.867 --> 47:54.580
Okay, yeah, I'm just checking my messages.
I'll be right there, okay?

47:55.163 --> 47:56.957
<i>3:04 a.m.</i>

47:57.040 --> 48:00.919
<i>Quick update. </i>
<i>Titties are gone and I'm gonna kill you.</i>

48:02.337 --> 48:04.715
Let's go, Mardy.
I don't want him to be the late kid.

48:04.798 --> 48:06.800
I know. I'm coming.

48:06.883 --> 48:07.884
Does he have to come?

48:08.468 --> 48:10.470
<i>3:07 a.m.</i>

48:10.554 --> 48:15.392
<i>Hey, Deon, it's Friday night. </i>
<i>I wanna fuck with this guy real bad. </i>

48:15.475 --> 48:20.397
<i>Do you have access to any diseases? </i>
<i>Maybe something airborne? </i>

48:20.480 --> 48:24.067
<i>Also, I sent you some tit pics. </i>
<i>I know you're a boob guy.</i>

48:24.985 --> 48:27.613
Uh, you know what, guys? Go ahead.

48:27.696 --> 48:30.824
[stutters] I've developed some cramps
and a headache.

48:30.907 --> 48:32.534
So, I'll meet you there.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.163
You let a tadpole get in
the way of you making out with Meredith?

48:36.246 --> 48:38.707
No, dude. It wasn't a fucking tadpole.

48:38.790 --> 48:42.753
It was like a water moccasin or like a...
I don't know, a shark or something.

48:42.836 --> 48:44.921
But there's no sharks in that pond.

48:45.005 --> 48:47.674
I guarantee you
it was a beer can or a shoe.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.552
Hey, Ben. Who's your little helper?

48:51.386 --> 48:53.305
It's me, Larry, Ms. Franklin.

48:53.388 --> 48:54.765
Larry?

48:54.848 --> 48:57.142
Yeah, from next door.
I was here the other day.

48:57.225 --> 48:59.895
Oh, Larry-Larry!

48:59.978 --> 49:03.357
Oh, my! I didn't recognize you
with your shirt off.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.942
Oh, yeah. It's me.

49:06.026 --> 49:10.072
So you're grown up. Oh, boy!

49:10.155 --> 49:12.658
I remember when you used to be young.

49:12.741 --> 49:15.202
That's so funny! [laughs]

49:15.285 --> 49:16.370
Yeah.

49:16.453 --> 49:20.540
In the summer, you used to play
in the plastic kiddie pool

49:20.624 --> 49:22.125
in just your underpants.

49:22.209 --> 49:25.045
Yes, no trunks necessary.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.464
Indeed. And now look at you.

49:27.547 --> 49:29.257
Life's marching on.

49:29.341 --> 49:32.761
Except you are looking younger
and that's just not making any sense.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.388
[laughing]

49:36.431 --> 49:38.934
[coughing]

49:40.227 --> 49:44.898
Oh, that's funny.
My late husband was funny, too.

49:44.981 --> 49:47.901
So you're here for summer,
then it's back to school?

49:47.984 --> 49:50.946
Ooh, no, no. School's done.
I'm officially an adult now.

49:51.029 --> 49:56.368
Yeah, I see that! An adult.18, right?

49:56.451 --> 49:57.786
Uh, 22 actually.

49:57.869 --> 50:04.543
22, is it? 22.
Oh, all summer long with the shirt off.

50:04.626 --> 50:07.963
I can tell him to put his shirt back on,
so you can recognize him, Ms. Franklin.

50:08.046 --> 50:10.882
Get back to work, Ben.
And put your shirt on!

50:10.966 --> 50:13.301
I don't need you calling in sick
with a sunburn.

50:19.641 --> 50:21.017
What is he doing?

50:22.060 --> 50:23.687
He's been acting so weird lately.

50:23.770 --> 50:24.896
I'm gonna follow him.

50:24.980 --> 50:27.733
He's been a dick to you lately.
Just let him deal with his own shit.

50:27.816 --> 50:29.317
He's still my dad.

50:31.862 --> 50:32.738
[cell phone chimes]

50:44.958 --> 50:49.129
Welcome to the 18th Annual
Deerfield Wife Carrying Competition.

50:49.212 --> 50:52.090
Now remember,
the husband must carry the wife

50:52.174 --> 50:54.217
throughout the entire duration
of the course.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.261
-Should a fall occur...
-Wayne O'Malley?

50:57.095 --> 50:58.138
Oh, hey, Geoff.

50:59.556 --> 51:01.767
That's the guy who got fired
from the go-kart track

51:01.850 --> 51:03.852
for telling a Chinese joke
to a Chinese guy.

51:04.519 --> 51:07.105
Well, you see, I have this disability...

51:07.189 --> 51:10.400
You don't gotta remind us, Wayne.
We can all tell you're disabled.

51:10.484 --> 51:11.401
[people laughing]

51:11.485 --> 51:13.153
Hey, where's your wife?

51:13.820 --> 51:16.865
She passed away.
The funeral was this morning.

51:16.948 --> 51:17.949
And you're here?

51:18.033 --> 51:19.618
It was her dying wish.

51:19.701 --> 51:23.288
Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't think two guys
should be allowed to race. It's unfair.

51:23.371 --> 51:26.416
We're an open-minded organization
here, Geoff.

51:26.958 --> 51:30.837
We don't need to end up
on the news later for discrimination.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.172
So shut the fuck up!

51:32.255 --> 51:34.007
Yeah, whatev. It ain't gonna matter.

51:34.090 --> 51:35.550
You know what? Stick around after,

51:35.634 --> 51:38.345
maybe I'll let you take a picture
of my trophy and my taint. [scoffs]

51:39.971 --> 51:42.766
Fuck that guy. What a dick.
Let's kick his ass.

51:42.849 --> 51:45.811
Okay, everyone.
It's time to mount your spouse!

51:49.147 --> 51:50.273
Bend over.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.566
Why do you get to be the wife?

51:51.650 --> 51:53.568
Ben, I had tits a week ago.

51:53.652 --> 51:54.778
Yeah, okay.

51:54.861 --> 51:56.988
There we go, bud.

51:57.614 --> 51:58.532

51:58.615 --> 52:00.200
-[gun fires]
-[farts]

52:00.283 --> 52:03.787
-Damn it, Dad!
-That gun startled me. Just go! Go!

52:25.934 --> 52:27.727
Come on, baby. We got this.

52:28.770 --> 52:31.106
[yelps] Fuck! Tight squeeze.

52:31.189 --> 52:32.983
-Let me get on your back!
-Yep!

52:33.066 --> 52:34.776
Oh, now we're cooking with gas!

52:34.860 --> 52:37.988
[man] Come on! Will you pretend to try?

52:38.071 --> 52:40.073
[spectators laughing and cheering]

52:47.414 --> 52:48.957
[cheers]

52:54.921 --> 52:56.089
Oh, man.

53:03.179 --> 53:04.097
[grunts]

53:04.764 --> 53:05.807
[woman grunts]

53:05.891 --> 53:07.183
Ow! You cheater!

53:07.267 --> 53:09.895
I ain't letting some
trailer trash scumbag beat me.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.229
You live in a trailer, too!

53:11.313 --> 53:12.981
Yeah, but mine's a double-wide!

53:13.064 --> 53:15.192
You know what?
Screw this, I'm taking over.

53:20.572 --> 53:21.781
[panting]

53:30.123 --> 53:32.751
Fuck you, Geoff! Your wife's only a nine!

53:32.834 --> 53:34.336
Your wife's fucking dead!

53:41.551 --> 53:42.719
[all cheering]

53:42.802 --> 53:44.054
[Ben] We won!

53:44.679 --> 53:48.266
You know, when I woke up this morning,
in my bathtub,

53:48.350 --> 53:50.352
it felt like every other day.

53:50.435 --> 53:52.562
I didn't know at the end of it
I'd be covered in glory.

53:52.646 --> 53:53.813
[laughs] Yeah!

53:53.897 --> 53:56.107
I gotta thank my wife for dying.

53:56.816 --> 54:01.321
And giving the opportunity for me
to run this race with my boy, Benny.

54:01.988 --> 54:05.617
And, Geoff, for the record,
that guy was Korean, not Chinese.

54:05.700 --> 54:06.660
You're a fuckin' racist.

54:08.828 --> 54:11.164
[man on TV] <i>Okay, let's do some</i>
<i>jab-cross, jab-cross, go! </i>

54:11.247 --> 54:15.210
<i>That's it! Little more power! Come on! </i>
<i>Good, good, good, go!</i>

54:15.293 --> 54:18.088
<i>Good. Oh, oh! Gotta keep your hands up.</i>
<i>Good. Good. Go.</i>

54:18.171 --> 54:19.839
-[Mardy grunts]
-[instructor] <i>Do it again. </i>

54:19.923 --> 54:21.257
<i>Come on! All right.</i>
<i>Good, go!</i>

54:21.341 --> 54:23.260
<i>-Do a roundhouse kick. No, no...</i>
-[knock at door]

54:23.343 --> 54:24.469
Dad, it's Larry.

54:24.552 --> 54:26.137
<i>Bring your knee up and--</i>

54:27.222 --> 54:28.348
Get in, quick.

54:32.477 --> 54:35.188
-How did you find me?
-Olivia told me.

54:35.271 --> 54:38.984
What? I can't believe
she would betray me like that.

54:39.067 --> 54:40.360
What's going on?

54:42.237 --> 54:45.573
Wayne has left me dozens
of threatening voice messages.

54:45.657 --> 54:46.950
And I don't want to put Krystal

54:47.033 --> 54:50.286
and poor, sweet, gorgeous little Aiden
in danger. Okay, so just go kick his ass, Dad.
Like you did to that flasher.

54:53.707 --> 54:55.125
I can't... I...

54:55.208 --> 54:56.710
It's not the same.

54:56.793 --> 54:57.961
Why?

55:03.341 --> 55:05.427
I've never told anyone this, Larry.

55:07.887 --> 55:08.722
[sighs]

55:09.681 --> 55:12.976
When I got out of the car
to stop the flasher,

55:14.269 --> 55:16.438
he shoved me to the ground,

55:17.063 --> 55:20.817
and then wrapped his big thighs
around my neck,

55:20.900 --> 55:24.738
and he proceeded to squeeze
until I lost consciousness.

55:26.906 --> 55:30.618
And when I came to, there was a scrotum...

55:32.370 --> 55:34.456
sort of draped across my nose.

55:36.291 --> 55:38.543
Almost sliding down into my mouth.

55:39.627 --> 55:42.589
But that was just the beginning.

55:42.672 --> 55:43.590
[woman screams]

55:43.673 --> 55:44.716
Oh, there it is.

55:44.799 --> 55:49.596
<i>He made me drive him around so that </i>
<i>he could flash people from my sunroof.</i>

55:49.679 --> 55:50.764
-[woman screams]
-Sorry.

55:50.847 --> 55:55.185
<i>I became his accomplice,</i>
<i>his accessory to flashing. </i>

55:55.268 --> 55:58.271
<i>I drove what felt like forever. </i>

55:58.354 --> 55:59.939
<i>I mean, I used a tank and a half of gas.</i>

56:00.023 --> 56:00.857
[lady] What the fuck?

56:00.940 --> 56:04.152
<i>In hindsight, I guess I could have </i>
<i>probably driven away at that point.</i>

56:04.235 --> 56:06.780
Yeah, okay. Can't wait.

56:08.531 --> 56:10.617
<i>It was like he was trying to set </i>
<i>a flashing record, </i>

56:10.700 --> 56:12.035
<i>beat his own high score.</i>

56:12.118 --> 56:14.412
Breathe. Just breathe, Mardy.

56:14.496 --> 56:17.165
<i>Probably would have gone on forever,</i>
<i>had it not been for Paul Bunyan.</i>

56:17.248 --> 56:18.458
Oh. Jesus!

56:25.590 --> 56:29.803
That's how he got knocked out.
I've never fought anyone, Larry.

56:29.886 --> 56:31.679
That's a fucked-up story.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.098
Okay, don't swear around Aiden.

56:33.181 --> 56:34.766
Aiden's not here, Dad.

56:37.185 --> 56:38.061
Oh.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.064
You could have told me the truth.

56:42.190 --> 56:44.818
I'm sorry. I was embarrassed, you know.

56:45.652 --> 56:49.322
What would you expect?
I'm not a Navy SEAL. I run a lab.

56:50.281 --> 56:55.036
Speaking of that,
I don't wanna do the science thing, Dad.

56:55.995 --> 56:57.914
I know, I can tell.

56:58.498 --> 57:00.625
I just want you to find
what makes you happy.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.253
I want you to know

57:03.336 --> 57:06.047
that I will support you
in whatever you decide to do.

57:07.590 --> 57:08.591
Thanks, Dad.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.301
Yeah, yeah.

57:12.762 --> 57:13.763
You all right?

57:13.847 --> 57:16.474
I forgot my Lorazepam at home.

57:16.558 --> 57:18.017
So just go back and get it.

57:18.101 --> 57:22.814
I can't. I told Krystal and Aiden
I was at an emergency conference.

57:22.897 --> 57:26.776
And my doctor's out of town.
I've left three messages. I just...

57:27.777 --> 57:30.530
All right.
Well, let's go see my friend Trey.

57:30.613 --> 57:33.867
He's kind of a part-time pharmacist. So...

57:34.325 --> 57:36.744
-Oh, that would be fantastic.
-Yeah.

57:44.169 --> 57:46.004
-[Ben chuckles]
-[Wayne grunts]

57:46.087 --> 57:48.798
Sweeter than the Stanley Cup.
[chuckles softly]

57:48.882 --> 57:51.468
Hey, thanks for inviting me.
This is really fun.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.929
It's my absolute pleasure, Benzo.

57:55.013 --> 57:57.432
Now, talk to me.
Tell me everything about your life.

57:57.515 --> 58:00.018
I don't wanna hear about
fucking New York City again, all right?

58:00.101 --> 58:01.728
Got any tuna on the hook?

58:01.811 --> 58:04.314
-Yeah, yeah, I do right now.
-Okay. Here we go. Go on.

58:04.397 --> 58:05.732
-I really like her.
-Okay.

58:05.815 --> 58:07.233
I'm pulling a big move tonight.

58:07.317 --> 58:11.404
She didn't get to go to her prom,
so I'm gonna sneak us both into Webster's.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.949
-Oh, that's pretty suave, Benzo.
-I thought so, too.

58:15.033 --> 58:17.035
-You know, there's gonna be dancing?
-Mmm-hmm.

58:17.118 --> 58:18.828
Dancing gets awkward, it always does.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.246
Try this.

58:20.330 --> 58:22.624
You take your middle fingers
when you're slow dancin',

58:22.707 --> 58:24.584
and you run 'em down
the back of her dress,

58:24.667 --> 58:26.961
and you leave 'em on her back dimples.

58:27.045 --> 58:30.340
Don't smash 'em around, don't squeeze 'em,
just leave 'em there.

58:30.423 --> 58:31.841
She'll be yours.

58:31.925 --> 58:33.843
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

58:33.927 --> 58:36.846
Both chicks I've been with,
it's 'cause of that move.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.389
You've only been with two women?

58:38.473 --> 58:41.935
I've only tried twice.
I'm two for two. I'm battin' 100.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.770
Don't you ever wanna have sex?

58:43.853 --> 58:47.148
Fuck you, dude. Two is pretty high.

58:47.232 --> 58:48.775
[Mardy] Uh...

58:48.858 --> 58:50.818
-Should we try?
-Dad, Dad, don't...

58:53.321 --> 58:54.906
-[Larry sighs]
-Fun apartment.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.415
Larry Fischer.

59:04.499 --> 59:07.293
If I champion,
you is the number one contender!

59:07.377 --> 59:10.338
It's good to have you back
in the 603, my brother.

59:10.421 --> 59:12.549
It is good to be back.
How you been?

59:12.632 --> 59:15.802
Shh. Man, I'm good, you know, real good.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.679
Just rappin', dealin',

59:17.762 --> 59:20.098
doing three shifts a week
down at Bunny's Mini Mart. Straight up entrepreneurin' that shit.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.936
So, Larry tells me you stressin'.

59:25.645 --> 59:26.813
I...

59:27.230 --> 59:28.106
Just...

59:28.690 --> 59:30.066
-It's okay.
-Yeah, just tell him.

59:30.149 --> 59:31.818
Okay. Yeah. I'm stressing hard.

59:31.901 --> 59:35.446
A lot. I normally take Lorazepam.

59:35.530 --> 59:37.448
I have a prescription,
so it's completely legal.

59:37.532 --> 59:40.243
Calm down, New Balance. I got you.

59:40.326 --> 59:43.162
[sighs] You're a lifesaver.
I really appreciate this.

59:43.246 --> 59:45.707
I'll finally get a good night's sleep,
so I thank you.

59:45.790 --> 59:48.960
Sleep?
No, man, you ain't gonna be sleeping.

59:49.043 --> 59:50.837
This shit, you might not even blink.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.630
What did I take? What's going on?

59:52.714 --> 59:55.258
<i>There's that M to the D to the M to the A</i>

59:55.341 --> 59:58.303
What? Methylenedioxymethamphetamine?

59:58.386 --> 59:59.929
I don't know. That shit's Molly.

1:00:00.013 --> 1:00:01.180
You son of a bitch.

1:00:01.264 --> 1:00:02.473
-What the fuck!
-[Mardy] Fuck!

1:00:02.557 --> 1:00:05.476
I told you to give him something
to get rid of his anxiety!

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:06.644
That's what I gave him!

1:00:06.728 --> 1:00:09.063
That shit will straight-up turn
your dark clouds

1:00:09.147 --> 1:00:10.857
into clear skies with rainbows.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:13.276
I feel like it's kicking in.
I feel like I'm effed-up!

1:00:13.359 --> 1:00:16.029
-No way it's kicking in that fast.
-Just stop worrying.

1:00:16.112 --> 1:00:17.989
I'm not gonna make you do it alone.
Give me one.

1:00:18.072 --> 1:00:19.866
It's free, 'cause you're my boy.

1:00:19.949 --> 1:00:21.784
What are you doing? Don't do drugs.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:23.161
[Trey] Whoa!

1:00:23.244 --> 1:00:26.414
Your pops is creatin' some
unwanted attention around the biz.

1:00:26.497 --> 1:00:28.458
Why don't we chill inside
for a second, okay?

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:30.001
I'mma play you guys a track.

1:00:30.084 --> 1:00:32.295
It's gonna put your entire lives
in perspective.

1:00:32.378 --> 1:00:35.131
Seriously though,
we gotta keep it down, okay?

1:00:35.214 --> 1:00:36.633
My mom and pops is being audited,

1:00:36.716 --> 1:00:39.385
so the whole house is, like,
super tense now.

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:43.139
Let's go. Down. Why you struggling, man?
Get down there.

1:00:43.222 --> 1:00:44.724
[Mardy] I don't wanna go down, Larry.

1:00:44.807 --> 1:00:45.975
[Trey] Legs are lockin' up.

1:00:50.396 --> 1:00:51.397
God!

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:09.582
Here we are.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:11.834
I was gonna cover your eyes
to surprise you,

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:12.960
but you were driving.

1:01:13.044 --> 1:01:14.796
Are you taking me to prom?

1:01:14.879 --> 1:01:17.548
Yeah, I was gonna take
Elijah Wood's cousin,

1:01:17.632 --> 1:01:19.759
but she bailed on me,
so you were my next call.

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:21.928
[chuckles] Okay. This is awesome.

1:01:22.512 --> 1:01:24.180
Now, we just gotta pick up our tickets.

1:01:29.352 --> 1:01:30.520
-A-ha.
-Oh.

1:01:30.603 --> 1:01:31.854
One minute.

1:01:31.938 --> 1:01:33.606
Okay. And...

1:01:34.857 --> 1:01:35.942
they're breathing.

1:01:36.025 --> 1:01:37.193
-That's good.
-Okay.

1:01:41.322 --> 1:01:43.533
Remember, no means no, okay?

1:01:46.327 --> 1:01:47.578
Ben O'Malley?

1:01:47.662 --> 1:01:48.746
Yeah?

1:01:48.830 --> 1:01:50.665
You're still dating high school girls?

1:01:50.748 --> 1:01:54.335
No. Well, yes, I am.
She's about to graduate.

1:01:54.419 --> 1:01:56.170
No, I know you.

1:01:56.254 --> 1:01:59.090
I kicked you out of prom four years ago.

1:01:59.173 --> 1:02:01.342
You just kept yelling, "Seniors rule"

1:02:01.426 --> 1:02:05.805
while you were laid out in that bush
soiling yourself, stinking up the place.

1:02:05.888 --> 1:02:09.809
I think the most embarrassing part
is I was yelling, "Seniors rule."

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:10.727
[chuckles]

1:02:12.270 --> 1:02:13.396
So, let me get this straight.

1:02:13.479 --> 1:02:16.733
You wanna take this young lady
into our prom

1:02:16.816 --> 1:02:18.901
to make up for the one she ruined
four years ago?

1:02:18.985 --> 1:02:20.319
Yeah.

1:02:20.403 --> 1:02:22.905
Aw. That's actually kind of cute.

1:02:22.989 --> 1:02:24.031
I thought so, too.

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:25.783
You know what won't be cute?

1:02:25.867 --> 1:02:27.952
When I get hauled in front of a grand jury

1:02:28.035 --> 1:02:30.830
for letting two disturbed 20-somethings
into an event

1:02:30.913 --> 1:02:32.957
with 300 vulnerable children.

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:39.380
I coach golf, soccer, tennis,
skiing, badminton, debate.

1:02:39.464 --> 1:02:42.633
I took the entire school
to build a barn last summer!

1:02:42.717 --> 1:02:44.594
I didn't even use a ruler.

1:02:45.219 --> 1:02:48.681
I did that!
This school can't lose me, all right?

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:51.851
So I'm gonna need the two of you
to get the fuck out of here!

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:56.189
-Okay, let's go. Let's go.
-Little millennial shit!

1:02:56.981 --> 1:02:57.815
God!

1:02:58.316 --> 1:03:01.527
You guys goin' in there?
Can you bring me some snacks?

1:03:01.611 --> 1:03:03.070
I'd love a slider.

1:03:03.154 --> 1:03:04.447
[music playing faintly from prom]

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:11.245
This sucks. I'm sorry.

1:03:11.913 --> 1:03:15.166
Don't worry,
I've set my expectations low for you.

1:03:15.249 --> 1:03:16.876
You're actually exceeding them.

1:03:17.376 --> 1:03:18.377
Nice.

1:03:25.384 --> 1:03:26.552
-Ooh.
-Ooh. [chuckles softly]

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:29.347
Oh. [giggles]

[exhales deeply]

1:04:08.177 --> 1:04:09.637
-Oh, my God.
-[chuckles]

1:04:10.471 --> 1:04:11.389
Oh, my God.

1:04:11.472 --> 1:04:14.392
I mean, so good. It's so good.

1:04:14.475 --> 1:04:16.769
Your lyrics and your timing...

1:04:16.853 --> 1:04:19.063
That is what I've been saying!

1:04:19.146 --> 1:04:22.149
That was astounding, Trey.
I've never known a boy like you before.

1:04:22.233 --> 1:04:24.652
Dude, I'm a soldier.
[imitates machine gun]

1:04:26.487 --> 1:04:27.864
Oh. What?

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.033
Trey, your laundry...

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:33.035
What?

1:04:33.494 --> 1:04:36.998
It looks so freaking cute
and cozy and comfortable.

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:43.254
Do you mind if I dive in?

1:04:44.213 --> 1:04:45.298
Damn right I do.

1:04:45.381 --> 1:04:48.718
Oh. Oh.

1:04:48.801 --> 1:04:50.636
Oh, my gosh.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.265
The textures. Oh, the aromas.

1:04:54.348 --> 1:04:56.809
You need to get the fuck out
of my dirty clothes, right now.

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:58.394
Yeah, Dad, I'm coming in.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:00.605
[groans]

1:05:00.688 --> 1:05:03.608
Trey, take off your clothes.
We need more laundry.

1:05:03.691 --> 1:05:06.110
You need to shut up.
You're gonna wake up my parents.

1:05:06.694 --> 1:05:09.780
What? No! No!

1:05:09.864 --> 1:05:13.242
You need to take off your clothes
because we need more laundry!

1:05:13.326 --> 1:05:15.077
-That's it. Get out.
-[Mardy] No!

1:05:15.161 --> 1:05:16.621
-Get the fuck out!
-No, I don't...

1:05:16.704 --> 1:05:20.583
Ooh-ooh. Okay, we'll get out. But first,

1:05:20.666 --> 1:05:24.128
your beard,
you need to scratch our backs with it.

1:05:24.211 --> 1:05:26.047
Yo, your father is fucked up!

1:05:26.130 --> 1:05:29.258
Get your beard on my back now.

1:05:29.342 --> 1:05:30.843
-Shut up, be quiet.
-Please, Trey.

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:31.969
-I'm gonna kill you.
-No!

1:05:32.053 --> 1:05:34.555
I can't be quiet. I can't!

1:05:34.639 --> 1:05:37.642
Please, put your beard on my back!
I'm itchy!

1:05:37.725 --> 1:05:39.518
-All right!
-Help me be quiet!

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:41.729
-Just roll up and lift your damn shirts.
-Okay.

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:46.108
[Mardy grunting]

1:05:47.818 --> 1:05:49.820
Ugh. You guys got issues.

1:05:49.904 --> 1:05:53.240
[Mr. Patterson]
Trey! I told you no friends over!

1:05:53.324 --> 1:05:55.034
Do you ever listen?

1:05:55.117 --> 1:05:56.202
Statue!

1:05:57.954 --> 1:05:58.829
Larry?

1:05:59.830 --> 1:06:02.083
Hi, Mrs. Patterson.

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:03.292
Who are you?

1:06:06.253 --> 1:06:07.129
Yeah, you.

1:06:07.213 --> 1:06:09.298
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. [laughs nervously]

1:06:09.382 --> 1:06:12.009
I am a friend of your son's, yeah.

1:06:12.093 --> 1:06:14.136
We go way, way back.

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:15.638
I'm also Larry's father.

1:06:15.721 --> 1:06:22.103
Yeah, some people, they call me Mardy.
Those that don't, do not know my name.

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:26.273
Oh, yeah. Of course. How are you?

1:06:26.357 --> 1:06:29.110
Really good. I'm taking the summer off

1:06:29.193 --> 1:06:31.195
-to backpack through Europe.
-[Larry] What?

1:06:31.278 --> 1:06:34.824
I am so glad that you're hanging out
with Larry again.

1:06:34.907 --> 1:06:36.617
He is such a good influence.

1:06:36.701 --> 1:06:39.912
[Trey] Yeah, no doubt. Uh, they were just
about to be on their way. So...

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:41.414
[Mrs. Patterson] Oh, okay.

1:06:41.539 --> 1:06:45.501
[distorted]
Well, it was great to see you, Larry.

1:06:47.336 --> 1:06:48.671
[in normal voice]
Come here.

1:06:48.754 --> 1:06:52.383
-Yes.
-Oh my goodness. It's been a long time.

1:06:53.342 --> 1:06:54.510
[chomping]

1:06:54.593 --> 1:06:56.846
-[Mrs. Patterson] Okay.
-[both chomping]

1:06:56.971 --> 1:06:58.472
[Mr. Patterson] What are you doing?

1:06:58.556 --> 1:07:00.141
-Get out of here!
-Get off my mom's hair!

1:07:00.224 --> 1:07:01.642
Get the clothes, Larry!

1:07:01.726 --> 1:07:03.227
[Mr. Patterson] Hey, put those down!

1:07:03.310 --> 1:07:05.229
-Bring those clothes back now!
-You get back!

1:07:05.312 --> 1:07:06.188
[Larry laughing] Yes!

1:07:06.772 --> 1:07:08.399
[dog barks in the distance]

1:07:11.527 --> 1:07:12.778
[Wayne] Hey, there he is.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:13.904
It worked!

1:07:13.988 --> 1:07:16.699
That dimple thing?
That was the greatest advice.

1:07:16.782 --> 1:07:18.659
[laughs] I knew it would.

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:21.245
Oh, God. Thank you so much!

1:07:21.328 --> 1:07:23.664
It was perfect, it was perf...

1:07:23.748 --> 1:07:27.251
She is incredible.
I was actually kind of smooth.

1:07:27.334 --> 1:07:29.128
[laughs] I knew you would be.

1:07:29.211 --> 1:07:31.255
See, you don't have to go
to New York to have fun.

1:07:31.338 --> 1:07:33.340
Hmm. Yeah, I know.

1:07:33.424 --> 1:07:34.258
[Wayne chuckles]

1:07:35.301 --> 1:07:40.598
It's not just, like, New York, though.
It was the job. The great company.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:44.393
You know, to be honest, Benny,

1:07:44.477 --> 1:07:46.771
I don't really get
what that company is.

1:07:46.854 --> 1:07:49.023
But I did read an article about it.

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:52.526
But I only read it once, so I didn't get
a chance to retain any of the information. Well, they're basically...
They're saving the environment.

1:07:56.113 --> 1:07:59.116
They have applications
that have already cut oil usage by 10%.

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.159
Fuck, yeah.

1:08:00.242 --> 1:08:02.578
Their founder, Peter Francis,
he's a genius.

1:08:02.661 --> 1:08:06.457
Yeah. If he's anything
like Peter Frampton, he's cool.

1:08:06.540 --> 1:08:09.168
-Yeah, kinda.
-That guy's a fucking genius.

1:08:11.337 --> 1:08:12.755
But I'm proud of you, bud.

1:08:14.381 --> 1:08:17.593
Never thought an O'Malley
would do something like this.

1:08:18.969 --> 1:08:20.179
Thanks a lot, Dad.

1:08:21.847 --> 1:08:24.058
-Let's burn some marshmallows.
-Yeah!

1:08:24.141 --> 1:08:25.684
You know how to work the stick?

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:27.144
I think I can figure it out.

1:08:27.228 --> 1:08:28.062
All right.

1:08:30.356 --> 1:08:34.193
[indistinct rap music playing

1:08:40.241 --> 1:08:41.492
Well, that was something.

1:08:41.575 --> 1:08:44.995
Yeah. Yeah.
I feel tired, but energized. You know?

1:08:45.079 --> 1:08:48.541
I wanna tell everyone.
But I don't wanna tell anyone.

1:08:48.624 --> 1:08:52.461
Hey, is this a new <i>Harry Potter</i> movie?
I don't think I've seen this one yet.

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:54.713
No, that's Trippy Jones, Dad.
He's a rapper.

1:08:55.673 --> 1:08:59.343
Oh, really? I think Trey
is way better than this guy.

1:08:59.426 --> 1:09:03.139
No, come on. Let's get you home.

1:09:03.222 --> 1:09:04.223
Oh, you know what?

1:09:04.306 --> 1:09:07.893
I already paid for the hotel room,

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:12.064
so I might as well just, you know,
stay for an extra day or two.

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:14.233
You don't have to worry about Wayne, Dad.

1:09:14.316 --> 1:09:17.069
Oh. [scoffs]
It's not that.

1:09:17.153 --> 1:09:18.779
No, I just, um...

1:09:18.863 --> 1:09:22.241
I pre-ordered <i>Marley and Me</i>
and I haven't watched it yet.

1:09:22.324 --> 1:09:26.287
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll just see you later then.

1:09:26.370 --> 1:09:29.248
Yeah, yeah. Uh, hit me up!

1:09:29.331 --> 1:09:31.083
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:09:41.677 --> 1:09:44.054
-[Ben grunts]
-[sighs]

1:09:45.806 --> 1:09:49.518
You know what? A few more weeks,
maybe a month,

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:52.688
hopefully my charges will be dropped.
I'll be in New York.

1:09:53.147 --> 1:09:55.357
It's gonna be good, man.
It's gonna be worth it.

1:09:56.358 --> 1:10:00.196
Listen, this morning,
I enlisted in the Marines.

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:03.032
Uh, what? Are you serious?

1:10:03.115 --> 1:10:05.993
I gotta do something big, man. You know?

1:10:06.076 --> 1:10:07.703
Like, something different.

1:10:07.786 --> 1:10:11.207
I can't stay in my comfort zone
or I'm gonna end up just like my dad.

1:10:11.290 --> 1:10:14.084
The Marines, though, man?
I mean, fuck, dude.

1:10:14.168 --> 1:10:15.586
I'll be okay.

1:10:15.669 --> 1:10:18.172
They start shooting at you, run.

1:10:18.255 --> 1:10:19.506
[chuckles]

1:10:19.590 --> 1:10:21.258
I don't think that's the job.

1:10:21.342 --> 1:10:22.468
I'm serious.

1:10:22.551 --> 1:10:24.553
You've been a pussy your whole life.
It's worked out

1:10:24.637 --> 1:10:27.181
-so stick to that. Yeah.
-Wow. Oh, okay.

1:10:27.264 --> 1:10:28.766
Why don't we stick to working?

1:10:28.849 --> 1:10:30.476
No, man. I got this.

1:10:30.559 --> 1:10:33.062
If you're man enough to fight
for our country, I can do this.

1:10:33.145 --> 1:10:34.772
Just go spend time with the fam.

1:10:34.855 --> 1:10:36.732
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

1:10:36.815 --> 1:10:38.901
I'll go hang out with Aiden for,
like, five minutes.

1:10:38.984 --> 1:10:40.361
I'll be back to help finish it.

1:10:40.444 --> 1:10:41.278
All right.

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:49.453
Fuck!

1:10:49.536 --> 1:10:51.789
[groans] Oh, God damn it!

1:10:52.414 --> 1:10:53.249
You okay?

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:56.126
I'm fine. Go do your thing.

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:57.628
Okay.

1:11:00.631 --> 1:11:02.174
[sighs] Fuck.

1:11:08.138 --> 1:11:10.182
Ben, someone left the toilet seat up.

1:11:10.266 --> 1:11:12.268
Was that a cover-up
for one of your dumps?

1:11:12.351 --> 1:11:13.352
No.

1:11:13.435 --> 1:11:16.897
You know how I know you're lying?
You left the fan on!

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:19.942
[exhales sharply]

1:11:39.378 --> 1:11:43.424
Oh, hi, Larry. Your worthless friend Ben
left already.

1:11:44.675 --> 1:11:46.468
I needed to talk to you
about something.

1:11:46.552 --> 1:11:48.304
Ooh, I'm all ears.

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:50.639
But speak into this one,
it works a little better.

1:11:51.223 --> 1:11:54.935
Uh... [clears throat]
So, Ben is struggling with the pool.

1:11:55.019 --> 1:11:57.187
He really, really needs a break.

1:11:57.271 --> 1:11:58.272
He's a great guy.

1:11:58.355 --> 1:12:02.526
So, I was hoping maybe you'd be willing
to drop the charges a little bit sooner?

1:12:02.609 --> 1:12:06.530
Drop the charges? Why would I do that?
Have you seen my backyard? It's--

1:12:06.613 --> 1:12:08.157
What if we...

1:12:10.534 --> 1:12:11.827
Oh!

1:12:12.870 --> 1:12:15.372
Well, we can do this, Larry.

1:12:15.456 --> 1:12:18.334
I hope you don't think this is just
gonna be some five-minute quick fix.

1:12:18.417 --> 1:12:21.253
You're gonna have to work hard
for this one.

1:12:21.337 --> 1:12:24.840
It's gonna take a lot of overtime
to bring this job to completion.

1:12:24.923 --> 1:12:28.427
And I think you should know,
I'm allergic to latex.

1:12:29.053 --> 1:12:31.972
Of course you are. Lambskin, too?

1:12:32.639 --> 1:12:33.807
Deathly.

1:12:34.725 --> 1:12:35.976
Saran wrap?

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.853
Oh, Larry...

1:12:51.950 --> 1:12:54.244
[Ben] That's amazing. Did she say why?

1:12:54.328 --> 1:12:56.663
No. She just said
she was dropping the charges.

1:12:56.747 --> 1:12:58.082
-What? Out of the blue?
-Yeah.

1:12:58.165 --> 1:12:59.291
The pool's not even done yet.

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:02.336
Well, she's apparently very happy
with the progress.

1:13:06.006 --> 1:13:07.424
Did you fuck her for me?

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:09.301
Did I fuck her? I didn't--

1:13:09.385 --> 1:13:10.636
-Yes, you did!
-No.

1:13:10.719 --> 1:13:12.554
Where were you last night?
You weren't home.

1:13:12.638 --> 1:13:14.390
You know, I've been hanging with my dad.

1:13:14.473 --> 1:13:16.600
He's been at the Kozy-eight,
which is your fault.

1:13:16.683 --> 1:13:18.936
-Oh! You rang that dirty old bell?
-No!

1:13:19.019 --> 1:13:19.937
Did you?

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:21.480
-I didn't do anything.
-[Wayne] Cool.

1:13:21.563 --> 1:13:23.273
Don't fuck around.
This is too important.`

1:13:23.357 --> 1:13:24.441
Nothing happened, man.

1:13:24.525 --> 1:13:26.151
-Did you?
-No. I didn't.

1:13:26.235 --> 1:13:28.487
-Are you meaning to say yes by saying no?
-No, I--

1:13:28.570 --> 1:13:30.364
Is she gonna wait while you're deployed?

1:13:30.447 --> 1:13:31.949
-Nothing happened!
-To Ruth and Larry!

1:13:32.032 --> 1:13:34.201
To Ruth and Larry!

1:13:34.284 --> 1:13:35.619
Yeah, Ben O'Malley.

1:13:35.702 --> 1:13:39.540
I just wanted to call you to tell you
that the charges against me were dropped

1:13:39.623 --> 1:13:41.291
and I've been completely cleared.

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:43.001
[man on phone] <i>Well, that's fantastic.</i>

1:13:43.085 --> 1:13:46.713
<i>Unfortunately, we already filled </i>
<i>our open positions. </i>

1:13:46.797 --> 1:13:48.924
<i>But if you'd like to resubmit </i>
<i>your application, </i>

1:13:49.007 --> 1:13:51.510
<i>-we can keep you in consideration...</i>
-Hey, Ben!

1:13:51.593 --> 1:13:54.263
Larry needs you to call
that drug dealer Trey

1:13:54.346 --> 1:13:57.307
and get a morning-after pill for him.
Hello.

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:11.363
[Wayne]
Hey, Mardy? Is this your room?

1:14:11.447 --> 1:14:13.407
They told me you were in here.
[knocks at door]

1:14:13.490 --> 1:14:15.200
I just need a minute of your time.

1:14:16.243 --> 1:14:18.787
Mardy, six people were murdered here.

1:14:18.871 --> 1:14:20.581
In this room alone.

1:14:20.664 --> 1:14:21.790
-Hey!
-[Wayne yells]

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:24.585
[grunts]

1:14:25.461 --> 1:14:27.171
Holy shit.

1:14:27.921 --> 1:14:29.089
Fuck.

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:33.969
Goddamn,
I've never felt anything so strong.

1:14:34.970 --> 1:14:37.514
That punch was fuckin' electric.
You're not human.

1:14:37.598 --> 1:14:40.601
Yeah, it was my Taser gun.
And I will use it again if I have to.

1:14:40.684 --> 1:14:44.188
I'm not here to fight.
I'm here to apologize.

1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:49.902
I need your help with my son.
You work in Scientology, right?

1:14:51.278 --> 1:14:54.990
No, I work in science.
If that's what you mean.

1:14:55.073 --> 1:14:59.077
Yeah. Do you happen to know anyone
that works for this company named...

1:15:00.329 --> 1:15:06.001
Fuck, I don't know, IGQ or something.
They sell energy bars maybe?

1:15:06.376 --> 1:15:07.794
Are you talking about ISG Energy?

1:15:07.878 --> 1:15:09.087
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:15:09.171 --> 1:15:12.674
I don't know. Maybe I do. Why?

1:15:12.758 --> 1:15:17.679
I need you to set up a meeting with me
and Ben with some head honcho there.

1:15:17.763 --> 1:15:20.933
We fucked up his life bad.
We gotta make it right.

1:15:21.016 --> 1:15:23.519
"We"? You messed up his life.

1:15:23.602 --> 1:15:25.479
If you weren't a chicken
we wouldn't be here.

1:15:25.562 --> 1:15:29.107
-You're the one that--
-Yeah, okay. All right! I'm sorry.

1:15:30.651 --> 1:15:33.904
Some people say I'm unstable and I snap.

1:15:34.446 --> 1:15:36.990
Uh, that was a snap.

1:15:37.824 --> 1:15:44.540
Listen, I need your help,
and please, if you do this for me...

1:15:45.832 --> 1:15:48.377
God, I can't believe I'm saying this.

1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:51.046
I'll let you kick my ass
in front of Larry.

1:15:51.588 --> 1:15:52.506
I'll do it.

1:15:52.923 --> 1:15:56.009
This is gonna be my last normal haircut
for a while.

1:15:56.093 --> 1:15:58.971
They're gonna shave my whole head
once I get to boot camp.

1:15:59.054 --> 1:16:01.640
Good job, Larry. We're all proud of ya.

1:16:01.723 --> 1:16:03.016
Thank you.

1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:04.643
So, where are they shipping you off to?

1:16:04.726 --> 1:16:07.521
Going to Parris Island in South Carolina.

1:16:07.604 --> 1:16:08.605
Oh...

1:16:08.689 --> 1:16:11.984
Yeah, I leave, uh...
I think it's next Tuesday I'm leaving.

1:16:12.067 --> 1:16:13.068
Oh.

1:16:13.151 --> 1:16:15.946
So, I'm doing the whole procrastination
right now of not packing.

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:18.448
It's cool. I'm nervous, but excited.

1:16:18.532 --> 1:16:20.909
Yeah, the first day
of the rest of your life.

1:16:20.993 --> 1:16:23.078
Yeah. There you go.

1:16:23.161 --> 1:16:25.455
Now you want me to square this off
at the back or--

1:16:25.539 --> 1:16:27.082
Oh, yeah, you can just--

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:29.001
Holy shit!

1:16:29.084 --> 1:16:30.794
[groans]

1:16:32.087 --> 1:16:36.383
Yeah! How'd you like that, huh?
That's what you get!

1:16:36.675 --> 1:16:38.885
I'm so sorry about that.
I will pay for all of this.

1:16:40.053 --> 1:16:42.556
-You ready for some more? Huh?
-Oh, no.

1:16:42.639 --> 1:16:43.473
Take that!

1:16:43.557 --> 1:16:45.058
[Wayne yells]

1:16:45.142 --> 1:16:47.269
-The fuck are you doing?
-Get over here.

1:16:47.352 --> 1:16:49.730
No, no. Take it outside!
Take it outside! No, no, no!

1:16:49.813 --> 1:16:51.315
Oh!

1:16:53.233 --> 1:16:55.110
-No!
-Oh!

1:16:55.193 --> 1:16:56.445
[Wayne grunts]

1:16:56.528 --> 1:16:58.739
Ah, Mardy! Come on, too much! Too--

1:17:00.407 --> 1:17:02.534
What the fuck, dude? No!

1:17:08.415 --> 1:17:11.043
-Don't put all your weight on me.
-Oh, sorry. Yeah, I can do that.

1:17:11.126 --> 1:17:12.628
Oh! Oh!

1:17:12.711 --> 1:17:16.965
Oh, that's enough! Stop! I surrender!

1:17:17.049 --> 1:17:20.052
And that's what you get
if you catch me off-guard

1:17:20.135 --> 1:17:21.845
and you sucker-chase me onto my roof!

1:17:23.221 --> 1:17:24.348
Holy shit.

1:17:24.556 --> 1:17:26.058
Oh. [chuckles]

1:17:26.141 --> 1:17:28.852
Hey, Larry. What a coincidence!

1:17:28.935 --> 1:17:30.312
You just kicked his ass.

1:17:31.104 --> 1:17:34.775
Oh, I guess I did, didn't I?

1:17:34.858 --> 1:17:35.776
[chuckles]

1:17:35.859 --> 1:17:37.611
You might wanna look in the mirror though.

1:17:40.322 --> 1:17:41.948
Oh, wow.

1:17:42.032 --> 1:17:44.159
No, hey. I think it looks badass.

1:17:47.579 --> 1:17:48.413
All right.

1:17:49.498 --> 1:17:53.293
Hey, you want to go get a six piece?
Miller Lites do it for ya?

1:17:53.377 --> 1:17:55.420
-Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it.
-Yeah.

1:17:55.504 --> 1:17:56.546
Come on, bud.

1:17:56.630 --> 1:17:58.173
-That was awesome.
-I know, I just...

1:17:58.256 --> 1:17:59.883
You came swinging and you almost hit me.

1:17:59.966 --> 1:18:02.511
-Well, I guess I had it in me. You know?
-That was really cool.

1:18:02.594 --> 1:18:03.845
It came out of nowhere.

1:18:05.013 --> 1:18:08.058
Okay, I don't know what
your threshold is for emotional pain,

1:18:08.141 --> 1:18:10.185
so I brought options.

1:18:10.268 --> 1:18:13.522
We have tequila, weed, Vicodin.

1:18:13.605 --> 1:18:17.734
This is either Zoloft
or it shrinks your prostate, not sure.

1:18:17.818 --> 1:18:20.821
And, uh, hard candy.
It's just 'cause I know you like 'em.

1:18:21.405 --> 1:18:22.906
Oh, you're the best.

1:18:22.989 --> 1:18:25.742
I'm gonna take all of these
at the exact same time.

1:18:25.826 --> 1:18:27.786
-Okay, maybe... This is too soon.
-Okay.

1:18:27.869 --> 1:18:31.164
Ben! Oh, there you are! Hey!

1:18:31.248 --> 1:18:35.252
I just got us a meeting
with the top dog at ISG!

1:18:35.335 --> 1:18:36.795
What? How?

1:18:36.878 --> 1:18:39.005
Don't ask! Just pack your shit.

1:18:39.089 --> 1:18:40.841
We gotta go to New York right now!

1:18:40.924 --> 1:18:43.677
Meredith. Always looking lovely.
I'll be outside. Let's go!

1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:46.054
-Oh, my God!
-Holy shit!

1:18:46.138 --> 1:18:48.473
-Ah!
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:18:48.557 --> 1:18:51.393
I gotta go pack! I'll text you
first thing when I get there.

1:19:10.662 --> 1:19:12.497
Mr. Francis will see you now.

1:19:13.123 --> 1:19:14.291
Okay, wish me luck.

1:19:15.709 --> 1:19:18.044
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna make this right for ya.

1:19:18.128 --> 1:19:21.923
What? No, no. Dad, turn around.
Please turn around, Dad.

1:19:22.007 --> 1:19:23.216
[Wayne] You'll thank me.

1:19:25.010 --> 1:19:26.678
Welcome, welcome.

1:19:26.762 --> 1:19:29.639
This is our VR meeting space.

1:19:29.723 --> 1:19:35.187
Mr. Francis is in Taiwan,
but he is very excited to meet you.

1:19:35.270 --> 1:19:37.272
Wait. We drove five hours

1:19:37.355 --> 1:19:38.899
and the guy we're gonna meet isn't here?

1:19:38.982 --> 1:19:40.233
-Hey, come on.
-That's weird.

1:19:40.317 --> 1:19:43.570
-It's not weird.
-Just talk and act as you normally would.

1:19:43.653 --> 1:19:48.200
And if you have any questions,
I'll be right here.

1:19:48.909 --> 1:19:50.744
Yeah, why are your pants so tight?

1:19:51.244 --> 1:19:55.248
They use less material,
it's better for the environment. So...

1:19:55.332 --> 1:19:57.459
It's okay, Dad. Just put your headset on.

1:20:01.755 --> 1:20:02.631
Here we go.

1:20:04.382 --> 1:20:05.467
Oh, fuck!

1:20:05.550 --> 1:20:07.177
-What's going on, Ben?
-Dad?

1:20:07.260 --> 1:20:09.679
Oh, my God! Where am I?

1:20:09.763 --> 1:20:11.097
-I'm a kangaroo!
-Dad, that's--

1:20:11.181 --> 1:20:13.475
You're a monkey! I don't like it.

1:20:13.558 --> 1:20:15.060
It's okay, Dad. It's not real. It's not real?
I think you're wrong.

1:20:16.728 --> 1:20:18.897
I think you're fucking wrong!

1:20:20.357 --> 1:20:22.776
Watch out! Polar bear straight ahead!

1:20:22.859 --> 1:20:25.237
Ben? Wayne? Peter Francis.

1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:27.280
It's talking to us. It knows--

1:20:27.364 --> 1:20:29.658
It's a friendly one.
He knows our names. Hi.

1:20:29.741 --> 1:20:34.788
I know it's bizarre, but don't be alarmed,
this is my avatar. Please, have a seat.

1:20:34.871 --> 1:20:39.584
Okay. I can do this. Non-issue.
Just chatting with a polar bear.

1:20:40.377 --> 1:20:41.378
[grunts]

1:20:42.128 --> 1:20:44.214
Come on, Wayne. Get it together.

1:20:44.297 --> 1:20:45.465
So, what can I do for you?

1:20:45.549 --> 1:20:47.509
-Well, I--
-Before I begin...

1:20:48.260 --> 1:20:50.971
I recycle. I mean, I don't all the time,

1:20:51.054 --> 1:20:54.516
but you're fixing all that stuff anyway,
so it probably won't matter.

1:20:54.599 --> 1:20:57.978
I just wanted to say
that Ben's life was perfect.

1:20:58.061 --> 1:21:02.649
He had all his ducks in a row, and--
Woah! Is that ice safe?

1:21:03.692 --> 1:21:05.735
Is this normal? Is this...
Should it be like this?

1:21:05.819 --> 1:21:07.612
Still fake, Dad. [chuckles]

1:21:07.696 --> 1:21:10.031
Listen, he is a smart, smart kid.

1:21:10.115 --> 1:21:12.325
Please don't make him do time
for my crime.

1:21:12.409 --> 1:21:16.705
Mr. Francis, I have dreamed of
working for you since I was 15.

1:21:16.788 --> 1:21:19.207
Your work in magnetics research,
in my opinion,

1:21:19.291 --> 1:21:21.042
is gonna save the environment.
I just...

1:21:21.126 --> 1:21:23.420
I really don't care what it pays.

1:21:23.503 --> 1:21:25.505
I just really want to be a part
of your cause.

1:21:25.589 --> 1:21:28.717
Please, polar bear.
This job is the love of his life.

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:30.135
[bird screeching]

1:21:30.218 --> 1:21:31.177
What's up?

1:21:32.345 --> 1:21:33.805
What the fuck? Ho!

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:36.808
Everybody, down! We got a pelican!

1:21:36.892 --> 1:21:39.853
Why's he so angry?
Oh, shit, he's coming this way!

1:21:39.936 --> 1:21:41.688
[screams]

1:21:41.771 --> 1:21:42.606
Ah, fuck!

1:21:42.689 --> 1:21:45.025
Ahhh! Leave me alone!

1:21:45.108 --> 1:21:46.610
[screeching continues]

1:21:46.693 --> 1:21:48.278
-Take it down a notch.
-Fuck!

1:21:50.488 --> 1:21:52.365
This is unlike anything he's ever done.

1:21:54.242 --> 1:21:55.201
[grunts]

1:21:55.285 --> 1:21:57.078
[screams]

1:21:57.162 --> 1:21:59.331
[grunting and screaming]

1:21:59.414 --> 1:22:01.333
Oh, fuck! There you are.

1:22:01.416 --> 1:22:02.918
I got you!

1:22:03.001 --> 1:22:05.128
Stupid! Fuck with me?

1:22:06.129 --> 1:22:07.547
[grunts]

1:22:08.298 --> 1:22:09.925
Get him off!

1:22:19.726 --> 1:22:20.602
I'm so sorry.

1:22:20.685 --> 1:22:23.229
If you can give me one second,
I can go calm him down.

1:22:23.313 --> 1:22:26.775
Growing up with a dad like that
and turning out halfway normal?

1:22:26.858 --> 1:22:28.777
Oh, you must be extraordinary.

1:22:28.860 --> 1:22:30.570
Why don't you join my research team?

1:22:30.654 --> 1:22:32.656
-That would be amazing!
-[Wayne screaming]

1:22:35.158 --> 1:22:36.076
[chuckles]

1:22:36.159 --> 1:22:39.913
I love when people don't understand VR.
Hey, watch this.

1:22:40.705 --> 1:22:41.957
What are you doing?

1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:43.375
[shushes]

1:22:43.458 --> 1:22:45.210
No. Come on. Please don't.

1:22:45.293 --> 1:22:46.211
[screams]

1:22:46.294 --> 1:22:47.504
[screams and grunts]

1:22:49.255 --> 1:22:51.466
Oh, my God, that's the best.

1:22:52.926 --> 1:22:53.927
[grunts]

1:22:55.220 --> 1:22:58.098
Wow. Good stuff. All right, where were we?

1:22:58.181 --> 1:22:59.599
What the fuck, man?

1:23:00.475 --> 1:23:02.352
[yelling]

1:23:03.603 --> 1:23:04.604
[grunts]

1:23:04.688 --> 1:23:07.023
You don't treat people like that!

1:23:08.024 --> 1:23:10.443
[Wayne grunting]

1:23:10.527 --> 1:23:13.530
Alien. Alien head. Huh?

1:23:13.613 --> 1:23:17.575
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad? Hey, hey.
Come on, let's get out of here.

1:23:17.659 --> 1:23:20.161
Okay. Did you get the job?

1:23:20.245 --> 1:23:23.540
-Don't worry about it. Come on.
-[panting]

1:23:24.791 --> 1:23:27.460
Ah, so what are you gonna do now?

1:23:27.544 --> 1:23:30.046
[Ben] I don't know, I'll figure it out.
I'm valededorian.

1:23:38.722 --> 1:23:40.140
[doorbell buzzes]

1:23:46.604 --> 1:23:47.439
Hey.

1:23:48.398 --> 1:23:49.399
Hey.

1:23:49.482 --> 1:23:51.651
How did it go with Peter Francis?

1:23:51.735 --> 1:23:54.821
Oh, good! He turned into an alien
and I cut his head off.

1:23:56.406 --> 1:23:57.574
Okay.

1:23:58.241 --> 1:24:01.578
I'm staying here. I wanna be with you.

1:24:02.871 --> 1:24:03.705
[sighs]

1:24:03.788 --> 1:24:07.250
Ben, I don't want to be the thing that
stops you from doing what you want to do.

1:24:07.333 --> 1:24:08.793
It's just a job.

1:24:09.669 --> 1:24:12.213
Plus, I've got a very approachable penis.
You said it yourself.

1:24:14.632 --> 1:24:16.092
This is where I'm happy.

1:24:22.974 --> 1:24:25.226
You know, you still kiss
like a sixth grader.

1:24:27.896 --> 1:24:29.522
[indistinct chatter]

1:24:39.532 --> 1:24:40.700
Look at that.

1:24:40.784 --> 1:24:44.287
She let you get away with that?
You must be packing something.

1:24:44.370 --> 1:24:46.581
She thinks the pool is a farm
and the goats are floats!

1:24:46.664 --> 1:24:50.168
Uh, everyone?
Could I have your attention, please?

1:24:50.251 --> 1:24:52.921
Thank you all so much for coming.

1:24:53.004 --> 1:24:56.382
I just wanted to say a few words
about my son, Larry.

1:24:56.466 --> 1:24:57.467
Oh, boy.

1:24:57.550 --> 1:24:59.177
I am so proud of him,

1:24:59.260 --> 1:25:04.057
both for the man that he's become
and the man that he's going to be.

1:25:04.599 --> 1:25:08.353
I am sad to see him go,
but I could not be...

1:25:08.436 --> 1:25:09.437
[PJ chuckling]

1:25:11.106 --> 1:25:16.694
I couldn't be more thrilled knowing that
he's going to protect our country.

1:25:16.778 --> 1:25:18.363
-Whoo!
-[all cheering]

1:25:18.446 --> 1:25:19.447
Yeah, Lar-bear!

1:25:19.531 --> 1:25:22.826
Oh, man. I can taste it.
I actually like it. Is that bad?

1:25:23.451 --> 1:25:25.120
Aiden, please stop that.

1:25:25.203 --> 1:25:27.288
Stop what? He said he likes it.

1:25:27.372 --> 1:25:29.374
I'm asking you to stop. Okay?

1:25:29.457 --> 1:25:30.959
You should listen to what I'm saying.

1:25:31.042 --> 1:25:33.419
You'd be lucky to become
half the man that Larry is.

1:25:34.671 --> 1:25:36.339
What do you know? You're a wuss.

1:25:36.422 --> 1:25:38.007
Excuse me? Uh...

1:25:38.716 --> 1:25:41.094
I did beat the living crap
out of Wayne here.

1:25:41.177 --> 1:25:42.262
He probably let you win.

1:25:43.179 --> 1:25:44.556
You need to shut the fuck up!

1:25:44.639 --> 1:25:45.890
[crowd gasping]

1:25:49.352 --> 1:25:50.562
Thank you, Krystal.

1:25:52.981 --> 1:25:53.815
Um...

1:25:54.274 --> 1:25:58.194
Aiden is right. He, uh...
He did let me win.

1:25:58.820 --> 1:26:03.533
So, Wayne, why don't you and I
fight right now, for real?

1:26:03.616 --> 1:26:06.828
What? Come on, Mardy.
This is a joyous occasion.

1:26:06.911 --> 1:26:09.330
What, are you afraid, huh?
You afraid, Wayne? -Watch your mouth, big boy.
-Oh.

1:26:11.916 --> 1:26:15.336
You don't want this shit-storm. Benzo?

1:26:18.673 --> 1:26:19.674
Fuck him up, Dad.

1:26:19.757 --> 1:26:21.467
-Show Aiden who's boss, Dad.
-Yeah!

1:26:21.551 --> 1:26:23.720
Oh, I got the fucking green light.
We're doing this!

1:26:23.803 --> 1:26:24.971
Let's go.

1:26:25.054 --> 1:26:26.055
[crowd cheering]

1:26:30.226 --> 1:26:32.353
[both yelling]

1:26:33.062 --> 1:26:35.607
[both grunting]

1:26:36.316 --> 1:26:37.400
That was pathetic.

1:26:37.483 --> 1:26:39.819
Yep. You wanna get a beer?

1:26:39.903 --> 1:26:41.070
-Yeah, dude. Sure.
-Yeah.

1:26:43.781 --> 1:26:46.743
[PJ] Hey, guys, who do you think
is gonna get married first?

1:26:46.826 --> 1:26:47.785
[Larry] Definitely Ben.

1:26:47.869 --> 1:26:49.579
[Meredith] This Ben? Not a chance.

1:26:49.662 --> 1:26:50.830
[Ben] Okay. All right.

1:26:50.914 --> 1:26:53.499
[Meredith] How could I marry you?
Your penis looks like a testicle.

1:26:53.583 --> 1:26:54.667
[PJ chuckles]

1:26:54.751 --> 1:26:57.962
And, Larry, dude, your dad had no right
to yell at Aiden like that.

1:26:58.046 --> 1:26:59.714
He's a good boy.

1:27:09.182 --> 1:27:11.309
Ruth. Ruth. Are you awake?

1:27:14.520 --> 1:27:17.357
-Larry?
-I ship off tomorrow morning.

1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:19.651
I was thinking maybe we could
hang out for a little bit?

1:27:19.734 --> 1:27:20.944
[chuckles]

1:27:21.027 --> 1:27:23.154
You make me feel so young.

1:27:23.821 --> 1:27:25.031
Wig on or wig off?

1:27:25.782 --> 1:27:27.033
Leave it on.

1:27:27.116 --> 1:27:29.160
-I'll bang it off.
-Ooh!

1:27:33.539 --> 1:27:34.749
That's three.
