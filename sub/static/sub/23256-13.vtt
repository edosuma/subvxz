WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.437
- Previously on Nashville...

00:02.480 --> 00:03.786
- These images, they come
back in my head.

00:03.829 --> 00:05.614
They'’re already back.
- I know.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.050
And you'’re gonna talk about it.
It'’s gonna get better.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.443
- Hello, Deacon.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.706
- I don'’t know.
Don'’t care to know.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.578
- I hoped in spite of
everything that there was

00:13.622 --> 00:14.971
a chance we could start over.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.712
- Once that show has
control over you,

00:16.755 --> 00:18.453
you'’re not really going to
have much say in anything.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.454
I'’m just afraid that
he'’s going to exploit you.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.977
- Gonna have to trust me.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.196
You know, I give a little,
you give a little.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.198
- I just hope your
interest in me

00:24.241 --> 00:25.982
is entirely about the music.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.636
- The tour is off.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.167
Oh, my God!

00:37.211 --> 00:38.473
- I..I..I didn'’t mean...

00:38.516 --> 00:40.344
- I'’ll go.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.999
- It'’s fine, it's fine.
I just need to see the baby.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.088
- No, no, no,
just wait, wait, wait!

00:46.394 --> 00:48.352
- Hi. I'’m Juliette.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.702
- Alannah.
- Hi.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.574
- Um, I...

00:52.617 --> 00:54.967
I just need a minute, okay?
One second, okay?

00:56.708 --> 00:59.059
Alannah, I can'’t believe this!

00:59.102 --> 01:00.886
- It'’s okay.
Just go be with her.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.410
- I don'’t know what to do.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.759
I have to make
sure she'’s okay.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.413
I'’ll call you
in a little while.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.893
- You don'’t have to.
- Hey, hey, hey, I want to.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.568
It'’s okay. You can, uh...
You can wake her up.

01:32.788 --> 01:35.747
- All the times my mama woke me
up in the middle of the night

01:35.791 --> 01:37.793
just to say she was sorry.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.494
God, what have I done?

01:45.105 --> 01:48.151
- Juliette, why...
why didn'’t you call me?

01:48.195 --> 01:50.414
Why didn'’t you say
you were coming?

01:50.458 --> 01:52.286
- I'’m sorry.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.157
I just needed to get home.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.161
You look like
you'’ve been through hell.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.858
- I have.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.775
I shouldn'’t stay here.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.516
Wait, wait.
What do you mean?

02:05.560 --> 02:08.476
Where are you going?
- It'’s fine. I understand.

02:08.519 --> 02:11.522
I'’m too tired to deal
with anything right now

02:11.566 --> 02:13.045
so I'’ll call you tomorrow.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.873
and we'’ll figure out
what'’s going on.

02:14.917 --> 02:18.660
- Wait, Juliette.
It'’s your house.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.807
- He won'’t go to the VA.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.418
- He doesn'’t have to
tell them what happened.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.941
- He won'’t listen.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.030
He thinks they'’re gonna
take the baby away.

02:41.073 --> 02:43.119
- I told you they don'’t do that.
It'’s confidential.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.514
Please?

02:46.557 --> 02:48.168
- Yeah, sure.

02:52.302 --> 02:55.175
- I knew I had them somewhere!

02:57.438 --> 03:01.311
So this is from the day
I married your grandmother.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.139
- Aw...

03:03.183 --> 03:04.749
- Is she not the most beautiful
woman you ever laid eyes on?

03:04.793 --> 03:06.273
- So beautiful!

03:06.316 --> 03:08.275
Dad, I can'’t believe how
much you look like her!

03:08.318 --> 03:09.711
- Don'’t tell me
you'’ve never seen a picture

03:09.754 --> 03:10.712
of your grandmother before?

03:10.755 --> 03:12.366
- Not that young.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.932
- All right, ladies.
It'’s getting a little late.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.543
Why don'’t we start
packing it in, huh?

03:15.586 --> 03:17.545
- What'’s wrong with
a little family time?

03:17.588 --> 03:20.548
- Oh, my God, Dad!

03:20.591 --> 03:22.332
Dad, you'’re so cute!

03:22.376 --> 03:23.942
- Oh, my God, look at you.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.510
- Thick as thieves, those two.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.295
Has your father ever
told you about the time

03:28.338 --> 03:31.776
they decided to go joyriding
in my new truck?

03:31.820 --> 03:34.301
- Actually, Beverly decided
to go joyriding in your truck

03:34.344 --> 03:36.390
and she ran it up a tree
and she called me for help.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.174
So that'’s what...

03:38.218 --> 03:40.437
- That'’s not the story
she told me.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.178
- Well, we both know
how Beverly would wrestle

03:42.222 --> 03:43.875
with the truth, huh?

03:48.402 --> 03:51.274
- Hey, Daph,
Mrs. Jacobson emailed me.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.711
She says you'’re running behind
on a couple of assignments.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.191
- Well, we know how
Miss Jacobson

03:55.235 --> 03:56.627
likes to wrestle with
the truth sometimes.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.545
You were gonna do your work
so you could do the show.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.851
- Yep.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.983
- Then do your work, please.
- Geez.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.768
- Thank you.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.901
- That'’s a lot of pressure
to put on a little girl.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.948
- I got it, Dad.
Thank you.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.216
- Oh, my God.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.609
- Hey. I'’m sorry.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.827
I could have gone
somewhere else, but...

04:22.871 --> 04:24.742
- No, no.
Come in, come in.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.879
- Thanks for this.

04:30.922 --> 04:33.316
I got out of there
with literally nothing.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.275
- I still can'’t believe this.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.798
- I know.

04:36.841 --> 04:39.888
It'’s horrible the way
they treat people.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.586
They kept me prisoner.

04:42.630 --> 04:46.634
They took everything
away from me.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.592
I was such an idiot.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.115
- You can'’t say that.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.335
- Avery knew it
was gonna be a disaster.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.641
Why didn'’t I?

04:53.684 --> 04:55.643
- Because they were
helping you?

04:56.948 --> 04:59.081
- Yeah, they did help me.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.822
That'’s the weird thing.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.693
I don'’t know that I
could'’ve gotten out of there

05:02.737 --> 05:05.609
without the understanding
that Darius gave me.

05:05.653 --> 05:09.047
Every moment,
I knew who I was

05:09.091 --> 05:11.180
and what I had to do.

05:11.223 --> 05:14.139
How can something
be so helpful

05:14.183 --> 05:16.620
and so harmful
at the same time?

05:18.970 --> 05:20.842
- I love you.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.800
- You'’re not so bad yourself.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.197
What?

05:28.240 --> 05:31.766
- Avery.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.420
I'’ve lost him.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.219
- Oh, stop.
It'’s perfect.

05:50.262 --> 05:51.351
- You were trying to burn it.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.743
I know your kind.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.441
And you with the bacon.
What are you doing?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.268
You still skinning the pig?

05:56.312 --> 05:58.227
- You wanted crispy bacon.
I'’m giving you crispy bacon.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.621
- I didn'’t say charred.
- Look at your waffles!

06:00.664 --> 06:04.276
You two were distracting me!

06:04.320 --> 06:05.756
Here.
Make yourself useful.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.022
- There'’s a lot
you don'’t know about me.

06:11.066 --> 06:13.024
Oh, damn it!

06:13.068 --> 06:15.636
Y'’all sit down.
I forgot my pills.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.680
- No, let me get '’em.
I'’ll get 'em for you.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.290
- No, no.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.510
Probably the only exercise
I'’ll get all day.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.433
- He'’s so cute.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.174
- I'’m confused.
You said he was mean.

06:32.217 --> 06:35.046
- Yeah, well, he'’s a bit
different than when I knew him.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.789
- Now'’s not the time, sweetie.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.965
- Well, it'’s been a long time.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.577
Aren'’t we supposed
to forgive and forget?

06:46.188 --> 06:48.799
Sometimes that can
be harder than other times.

06:48.843 --> 06:52.063
- My advice, girls,
is never get old.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.370
Pills for this,
pills for that.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.633
Now they got pills
for the pills.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.288
- So, Dad, I was thinking
about going

06:59.331 --> 07:01.464
with Jonah on
his European tour.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.988
- Yes.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.730
- Um, six weeks.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.863
Italy, France, Greece...

07:08.906 --> 07:10.342
- Six weeks.
- Czech Republic...

07:10.386 --> 07:12.432
- Oh, there'’s an adventure.
- I know.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.824
- Don'’t you think
that'’s a little long?

07:13.868 --> 07:15.304
I mean, don'’t you have
work to do?

07:15.347 --> 07:16.914
- I mean, I can write
when I'’m there.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.525
- Yeah, but you won'’t.
That'’s the problem.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.265
- That'’s unfair to say.

07:20.309 --> 07:21.919
- Let the girl see the world.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.095
- Yeah. I mean, think of all
the history I'’ll learn.

07:24.139 --> 07:27.316
- Kids these days with
their heads in their phone,

07:27.359 --> 07:29.318
let her have a real
experience for a change.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.841
- You don'’t know a single thing
about the situation.

07:30.885 --> 07:31.886
But you got this
big opinion on it?

07:31.929 --> 07:33.583
Is that it?

07:33.627 --> 07:38.893
- I have no opinion on your
wonderful trip to Europe.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.727
- Okay, no peeking.
You'’re gonna ruin the surprise.

07:46.770 --> 07:47.815
You ready?

07:47.858 --> 07:49.381
And open up!

07:49.425 --> 07:50.774
- Mommy!

07:50.818 --> 07:53.168
- How'’s my baby!

07:53.211 --> 07:54.909
Oh, look at you!

07:54.952 --> 07:56.737
How'’d you get so big?

07:56.780 --> 08:00.784
Oh, I love you so much.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.874
I missed you.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.442
Did you miss me?
Yeah?

08:09.445 --> 08:11.621
Let'’s play.
Come on.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.063
I'’m gonna eat you.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.720
Thank you.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.378
- Hey, sweetie.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.772
Come here a sec.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.252
Guys, no, enough.
Leave us, please.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.951
Let us talk.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.474
You wanna win
this thing, right?

08:38.518 --> 08:39.867
- Yes, of course.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.172
- All right, then
you'’re gonna have

08:41.216 --> 08:42.739
to start doing
something different.

08:42.783 --> 08:46.395
'’Cause your vote totals,
they'’re dropping.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.310
- I thought they
added up over time.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.790
- Well, it'’s nothing
to worry about.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.008
We just wanna
get out ahead of it.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.749
- It is something
to worry about.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.490
You'’re incredibly talented
but you'’re hiding it.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.320
- We think it'’s time
to lose the guitar.

08:58.363 --> 09:02.193
- My guitar is how I express
myself as an artist.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.281
I...
- No, the guitar...

09:04.979 --> 09:06.415
The guitar is not the artist.
You'’re the artist.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.286
Remember that, will you?

09:08.330 --> 09:10.593
Just, hey, listen to what
she has to say.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.290
Yeah?

09:12.334 --> 09:13.814
- It'’s about your heart.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.424
You know, it'’s not
about the instrument.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.035
You have to tell the story
with your whole self.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.950
Owning the stage.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.910
You can'’t do that just
hiding behind a guitar.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.132
- Not dance.
Just move.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.047
Be your true self.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.659
Once you do it,
it'’ll feel so liberating.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.486
- This is my true self
with my guitar.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.184
- I know it'’s scary.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.099
Daphne, hey, I'’ve been there.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.928
We'’ll look at film together.
I'’ll demonstrate for you.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.017
And once you see it,
you'’ll so get it.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.802
Really, it won'’t
be so bad, okay?

09:52.026 --> 09:53.375
- This is a waste of time.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.898
The VA can'’t help me.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.074
- Okay, then we'’re gonna
find somebody who can.

09:57.118 --> 10:00.121
- I am sorry I scared you.
But I am fine now.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.949
- You'’re not fine.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.168
Nobody'’s fine the day after
they try to kill themselves.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.692
- I didn'’t try to kill myself.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.782
- Okay. Well, you scared
the crap out of everybody.

10:08.825 --> 10:12.133
And honestly, I can'’t
take responsibility

10:12.176 --> 10:13.569
for this on my own.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.267
You need somebody
qualified to help you.

10:21.751 --> 10:24.058
- We played for
like 45 minutes

10:24.101 --> 10:26.538
and she literally collapsed.

10:26.582 --> 10:30.281
Which I wouldn'’t mind
doing myself.

10:33.981 --> 10:37.071
- '’Cause I don't think
I should stay here.

10:37.114 --> 10:40.074
- Well, that'’s ridiculous.
This is your house.

10:42.467 --> 10:46.689
- Yeah, but I'’ve been gone

10:46.733 --> 10:50.911
and you'’ve been
taking care of her.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.522
Things are just
different now.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.785
- Well, I'’ll stay
someplace else then.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.482
You should stay here.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.836
- So this is someone you'’re...

11:02.879 --> 11:06.100
Someone I'’m what?

11:06.143 --> 11:08.842
- You'’re into...

11:08.885 --> 11:11.714
- I don'’t know what it is.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.673
- But it'’s something.

11:13.716 --> 11:18.590
- Look, Juliette, you left
without saying goodbye.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.027
You refused to come back.

11:20.070 --> 11:23.421
You refused to
communicate with me.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.075
What did you expect me to do?

11:25.119 --> 11:28.644
- I didn'’t have
any expectations.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
And I don'’t have any now.

11:30.733 --> 11:35.259
I'’m just trying to understand
what is, that'’s all.

11:35.303 --> 11:39.786
- What is is that...

11:39.829 --> 11:42.440
I can'’t do this any more.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.268
You know,
following you around.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.705
Picking up the pieces.

11:45.748 --> 11:48.229
Waiting for the next
disaster to happen.

11:50.797 --> 11:54.322
You really didn'’t
give me any choice.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.020
- I know I didn'’t.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.140
- This is a disaster.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.663
Everybody loves you.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.623
- No, they don'’t!
My votes are dropping

12:34.666 --> 12:36.233
and they said they want me
to do something different.

12:37.669 --> 12:38.714
- Perform more.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.281
- Okay.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.283
- "Own my body."

12:42.326 --> 12:44.285
- I don'’t know.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.503
But I have to do it in
front of millions of people.

12:48.463 --> 12:49.856
- I don'’t know.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.945
I don'’t know what
they want me to do.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.425
- Okay. Well, just know that
you don'’t have to do

12:54.469 --> 12:55.644
anything that you
don'’t wanna do.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.213
- Yeah.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.704
This is what it'’s like.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.796
Stratton?

13:20.712 --> 13:22.845
- Excuse me, sir.
I'’m so sorry.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.716
We'’ve been waiting five hours

13:24.760 --> 13:26.153
and he still haven'’t
seen a doctor yet.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.286
- He has PTSD.
He'’s in a pretty bad way.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.810
- Did you make an appointment
with mental health?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.115
- I tried.
They said 60 days.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.161
He doesn'’t have that long.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.727
- We see patients as
quickly as possible.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.077
Someone will see him.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.515
'’Cause he really needs help.

13:40.558 --> 13:41.995
All these people need help.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.258
- And we'’re doing
the best that we can.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.694
- I don'’t understand.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.217
These people sacrificed
so much for our country.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.653
How do they get
treated this way?

13:48.697 --> 13:50.960
- Ma'’am, I served
two tours in Iraq.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.310
I assure you I care about
them as much as you do.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.008
We do the best that
we can under the conditions

13:55.051 --> 13:56.748
that are given to us.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.750
Call Washington.
Maybe they'’ll listen to you.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.668
- I'’m so sorry.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.756
I apologize.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.106
I know it'’s not your fault.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.847
I'’m just really
scared for him.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.375
- Sean.
Sean McPherson.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.206
I'’m so sorry.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.598
I will bring him
right back in here.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.302
- Sean!

14:28.345 --> 14:30.086
Sean, please don'’t walk
away from me!

14:30.130 --> 14:32.306
I told you I cannot take on
this responsibility on my own!

14:32.349 --> 14:34.699
- You don'’t have to.

14:34.743 --> 14:35.918
- What is that
supposed to mean?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.399
- I'’m fine.
You helped me.

14:38.442 --> 14:39.791
- Well, that'’s garbage
and you know it.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.402
- Listen, I can'’t
be here, okay?

14:41.445 --> 14:44.492
It'’s like...
It'’s like being back there.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.189
I know they do
good things for people

14:46.233 --> 14:48.104
but I start shaking
before I even get inside.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.976
- Okay. Well, there are lots
of other organizations...

14:50.019 --> 14:51.151
- I'’m not your project!

14:53.240 --> 14:54.850
- I never said you were.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.156
- You just wanna make
yourself feel better

14:56.199 --> 14:57.505
by thinking that
you'’re helping somebody.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.202
- Would you take a second

14:59.246 --> 15:00.203
and just stop feeling sorry
for yourself all the time?

15:00.247 --> 15:03.076
- I feel sorry for you!

15:03.119 --> 15:04.294
That this is the best
that you can come up with

15:04.338 --> 15:05.252
to do with your life.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.256
- Get professional help
or I'’m out.

15:18.656 --> 15:22.443
- ♪ Let love in

15:22.486 --> 15:25.533
♪ Let love in

15:25.576 --> 15:28.014
♪ Let it take you

15:28.057 --> 15:31.582
♪ To a place you'’ve
never been ♪

15:33.019 --> 15:38.763
♪ Let love go, let love go

15:40.374 --> 15:43.246
♪ Set it free so it can find

♪ Its way back home

15:54.257 --> 15:57.434
- That song is gonna
change peoples'’ lives.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.783
- Oh, come on.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.350
- I mean it.
Look at me.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.570
I'’m a mess.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.008
- Oh, she'’s amazing.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.837
We had the sweetest moment.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.927
She saw this prism of
light dancing on the wall

16:11.971 --> 16:14.843
and to her, it was like magic.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.542
Could have stayed in
that moment forever.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.373
What?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.723
- It'’s just...
You'’ve been through hell...

16:25.767 --> 16:27.421
- Go on.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.424
- And I'’ve never seen
you more at peace.

16:30.467 --> 16:33.427
It'’s a beautiful thing.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.690
And I'’m sure that
Avery will see it too.

16:35.733 --> 16:39.041
- No, I think it'’s...
it'’s too late.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.651
- I don'’t believe it.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.914
You'’re just gonna have
to have some patience.

16:51.140 --> 16:54.143
- I'’m not ghosting you.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.449
- Okay.

16:55.492 --> 17:00.323
- It'’s just...it's hard.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.413
- I know. Look, I am so
sorry about what happened.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.154
- Not your fault.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.635
Don'’t worry.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.289
- You don'’t have to.

17:09.332 --> 17:12.770
- Look, I'’m as shocked
by all of this as you are.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.817
I mean, I'’m gonna get a
place as soon as I can.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.429
Say something.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.432
- That you'’re gonna
give me a chance

17:22.476 --> 17:23.912
to figure all
of this out.

17:23.955 --> 17:27.133
- It'’s just too
complicated, Avery.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.873
What are you gonna figure out?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.962
Whether to keep
betraying your wife

17:31.006 --> 17:32.964
or your best friend or both?

17:33.008 --> 17:34.966
- I'’m not betraying anyone.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.317
- You think because
you'’re being honest

17:37.360 --> 17:38.927
that you'’re
not betraying anyone.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.972
- And you'’re over-simplifying
this whole thing

17:41.016 --> 17:43.323
because you'’re scared
and I don'’t blame you.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.760
- I'’m not scared.
I'’m...

17:45.803 --> 17:48.458
I'’m sad.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.939
You'’ve got a daughter whose
mother just came home

17:50.982 --> 17:54.812
and now she might lose
her father instead.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.727
I know what that'’s like.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.686
That was me.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.296
- Listen to me.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.038
She is not going
to lose her father.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.781
- I can'’t be the one that
breaks up your family.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.914
- No, Alannah, please.
Look...

18:09.958 --> 18:11.438
- I'’ll talk to you later.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.357
- So you want me
to keep my mouth shut?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.359
- No. I didn'’t say to keep
your mouth shut, all right?

18:19.402 --> 18:21.578
I'’m just asking you to respect
the fact that I'’m the father.

18:21.622 --> 18:22.884
And I have to
do the parenting. That'’s it.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.494
- I completely respect that.

18:24.538 --> 18:25.930
- Yeah, until you'’re
inciting them against me

18:25.974 --> 18:28.585
with some little
inside joke or something.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.457
- Come on!
I can'’t have fun with them?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.417
- You don'’t get
to do that anymore.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.158
- And what is it
I'’m supposedly doing?

18:36.202 --> 18:37.551
- You don'’t get to act
like nothing is happening

18:37.594 --> 18:39.292
when something is happening.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.945
You don'’t get to act like
nothing happened back then

18:40.989 --> 18:42.512
when something happened,
all right?

18:42.556 --> 18:43.948
- I have no idea what
you'’re talking about!

18:45.776 --> 18:47.213
You don'’t think I remember
what fun used to be for you

18:47.256 --> 18:48.910
when you would throw me
into a wall?

18:48.953 --> 18:50.520
Or you'’d throw Beverly
into a wall

18:50.564 --> 18:52.261
then you come back in
like nothing ever happened?

18:52.305 --> 18:53.436
They don'’t get
to see that, do they?

18:53.480 --> 18:54.742
- I'’m sorry!

18:54.785 --> 18:56.135
- Sorry doesn'’t cut it,
all right?

18:56.178 --> 18:57.832
- I don'’t expect you
to believe it.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.181
But there were times, many
times, I think most times...

19:00.835 --> 19:02.402
- When what you'’re saying
didn'’t happen!

19:02.445 --> 19:04.012
- Don'’t say that to me!

19:04.055 --> 19:05.535
That'’s what I'm talking
about right there!

19:05.579 --> 19:08.103
- I understand that'’s
how you remember it!

19:08.147 --> 19:09.800
- Sorry we'’re late.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.542
- Good evening, ladies.

19:12.586 --> 19:16.024
I'’m gonna leave you to have
dinner with your Dad tonight.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.808
I.. uh...

19:17.852 --> 19:20.942
I wouldn'’t want to be
the cause of any...fun.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.773
- Go wash up.

I'’m sorry.
This just feels so wrong.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.497
- If you could see it like me,
you'’d feel differently.

19:54.541 --> 19:58.240
- It just doesn'’t feel
like me at all.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.460
I look like an idiot.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.331
- I would never let you
look like an idiot.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.854
Okay, you'’re scared.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.247
You'’re being way
too hard on yourself.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.380
Daphne, you have
so much potential.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.556
You may not see it yet,
but I do.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.472
That'’s why I've fought so
hard to have you on my team.

20:12.515 --> 20:15.214
You know that, right?

20:15.257 --> 20:19.740
Let me show you.
Maybe it'’ll help, okay?

20:19.783 --> 20:21.132
Okay, music.

20:45.113 --> 20:49.030
Just connect to the poetry
and feel that song.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.293
- That'’s not fair.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.602
- You can'’t take my song

20:55.645 --> 20:58.169
and do something I could
never possibly do with it.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.780
- I was trying to...

20:59.823 --> 21:01.260
- How do you expect me to sing
it after you doing that?

21:01.303 --> 21:02.826
- I don'’t want you
singing it like me.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.481
I want you to sing it like you.
I was just trying...

21:05.525 --> 21:08.092
- I gotta go.
- Oh, Daph, don'’t walk away.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.485
Come on!

21:18.886 --> 21:20.409
- Hey!

21:23.673 --> 21:25.327
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?

21:25.371 --> 21:26.981
- You can talk to me
for 100 minutes.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.025
Morning, girls.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.244
- Morning!
- Hi, Brad.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.249
- Not sure I quite
understand the question.

21:34.293 --> 21:39.341
- Well, when I signed, a lot
of things were promised to me,

21:39.385 --> 21:41.648
and I know things
can take time.

21:41.691 --> 21:44.259
I just wanna make sure
that there isn'’t anything

21:44.303 --> 21:45.434
getting in the way.

21:45.478 --> 21:46.696
- Met with the team yesterday.

21:46.740 --> 21:47.828
We spent a half hour
just on you.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.179
- Need those songs.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.485
- Well, I just sent
you four new songs.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.356
- Yeah, you did,
and they'’re great.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.531
They'’re just...

21:55.575 --> 21:57.098
- Not great enough.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.056
- We sent you songs, too.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.624
- Well, I didn'’t think
they were me.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.625
- And I don'’t think
you'’re equipped

22:02.669 --> 22:03.844
to make that decision yet.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.367
- About my own identity
as an artist?

22:05.411 --> 22:07.369
- Whoa! Ouch!
Wait, no.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.066
Too many big words. No.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.547
About what will get
radio stations and advertisers

22:11.591 --> 22:14.550
and brand influencers to start
talking about Alannah Curtis.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.509
'’Cause when Alannah Curtis
gets air time,

22:16.552 --> 22:19.512
then Alannah Curtis
can explore her,

22:19.555 --> 22:22.341
what was it,
identity as an artist.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.907
- Okay.

22:23.951 --> 22:27.041
- We'’re your friends.
I'’m your friend.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.651
And I help my friends.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.174
That'’s just the way
the world works, you know.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.872
I'’m sorry to tell you.

22:31.915 --> 22:35.615
Are you my friend, hmm?

22:50.238 --> 22:51.413
- Hey.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.547
- Guess this was bound
to happen, right?

22:54.590 --> 22:55.722
- Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.680
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.555
How'’s Jake?

23:02.598 --> 23:03.904
How are things going?

23:03.947 --> 23:05.514
- I think things are
a lot better, yeah.

23:05.558 --> 23:06.820
- Better. Good.

23:06.863 --> 23:07.908
- Brad dropped the whole
custody thing.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.823
- Amen.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.608
- But he'’s still planning to
send Jake to boarding school.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.523
So, you know, we'’ll see.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.351
- I don'’t even know
what to say, you know...

23:16.395 --> 23:17.700
- I know.
There'’s nothing to say.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.137
Let'’s just hope
that karma exists

23:20.181 --> 23:22.357
so that Brad can
get his someday.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.403
- That would be nice.
- Yeah.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.795
And what about you?
How are the girls?

23:25.839 --> 23:27.144
- They'’re good.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.232
Maddie'’s in love,
it seems like.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.364
- Wow.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.670
- Yeah, yeah, and Daphne'’s...

23:30.713 --> 23:32.454
- A Shooting Star!
It'’s amazing.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.629
We'’re watching and voting.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.718
Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.376
- Miss you.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.812
Maybe I shouldn'’t say that...

23:42.856 --> 23:44.205
- I miss you every day.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.774
- Yeah, I'’m sorry
if I made things...

23:47.817 --> 23:50.603
- No, no, let'’s not start
that whole thing again.

23:51.821 --> 23:53.432
Listen, Deacon,

23:53.475 --> 23:56.783
I'’ve been meaning
to say something to you.

23:56.826 --> 23:57.958
I...

24:00.134 --> 24:05.182
- I'’m just so grateful
for your kindness

24:05.226 --> 24:06.488
and your honesty and...

24:06.532 --> 24:08.490
- No, no, no...
- No, really, listen.

24:08.534 --> 24:14.104
I was living under a cloud
of Brad that was so toxic.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.584
and... I don'’t know.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.021
I feel like I'’d forgotten
that people...

24:18.065 --> 24:21.590
that men
could be...

24:21.634 --> 24:24.767
decent and good.

24:26.682 --> 24:29.380
And you gave that to me.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.820
- Well, you know
what you gave me.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.213
- I don'’t know.
A headache?

24:36.257 --> 24:37.867
- No, stop.
Seriously...

24:39.042 --> 24:42.002
- I was in a dark cave.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.223
You helped me come out.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.053
Thank you.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.123
What?

25:16.166 --> 25:17.777
I thought you
were a carpenter.

25:17.820 --> 25:21.258
- In those days, you did
whatever you got hired to do.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.173
- So were you there when
the oil like sprayed

25:23.217 --> 25:25.088
a million feet in the air and
came down all over everyone?

25:26.612 --> 25:29.179
- No.
I'’m afraid that's in movies.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.660
I just serviced the diesel
that ran the pump.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.271
Not very romantic,
I'’m afraid.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.751
- I don'’t know.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.581
I'’m really glad
that you came.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.018
- Your daddy raised
two wonderful daughters.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.328
- I know what
you'’re gonna ask.

25:47.371 --> 25:51.201
- It'’s just so hard to see
how it was that bad.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.290
- People change.

25:53.334 --> 25:59.166
I don'’t make excuses
for the way I was.

25:59.209 --> 26:03.213
I'’ve had a lot of years
to think about it.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.607
- I just wish...

26:05.651 --> 26:07.957
Hey.
- Hey.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.611
- Grandpa worked on an oil rig.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.265
- Yeah.

26:11.308 --> 26:12.701
- I did not know that.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.703
- The oil gushed like
a mile into the air

26:14.747 --> 26:16.096
and sprayed all over him.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.185
It'’s crazy.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.100
- I'’m gonna have
to watch this one.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.884
- Guess there'’s a lot about
Gramps that we don'’t know.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.545
- You were right.
That'’s what's going on.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.634
Hi, Grandpa.
- Hello, child.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.941
What'’s going on?

26:34.984 --> 26:36.595
- I should have never
done the show!

26:36.638 --> 26:38.640
You'’re right!
You happy now?

26:38.684 --> 26:41.251
- Why would that make me--
- I'’m going to bed!

26:41.295 --> 26:43.079
- Daphne!

26:48.694 --> 26:49.825
- Yeah.
- Hello.

26:49.869 --> 26:50.870
- Hey.
Thanks for seeing me.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.523
- Oh, absolutely, yeah.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.742
- Yeah. I hope I'’m not
interrupting anything.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.309
- No, no, not at all.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.310
It'’s nice to finally
meet you, actually.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.703
I'’m a big fan.

26:57.746 --> 26:58.965
- Well, I'’m a big fan
of yours too.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.096
For more years that
I care to count.

27:01.576 --> 27:02.621
- Well, then,
let'’s don't count.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.797
- No. That'’s okay.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.451
- So I kind of had
to pry it out of her

27:07.495 --> 27:09.018
but I think I got a handle
on what'’s going on.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.673
- Well, I'’d feed real bad
if she thinks that

27:11.717 --> 27:13.762
I'’m trying to force her
to be something she'’s not.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.417
- Yeah. I think she
is a little afraid

27:16.460 --> 27:17.940
what you'’re asking of her.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.942
Might be a little young.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.379
- Oh, I'’m sorry, but I think
she'’s got it in her head

27:22.423 --> 27:25.382
that I'’m asking her
to be sexy or seductive.

27:25.426 --> 27:28.603
It'’s not like
that at all, no.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.431
- Well, good.
What is it then?

27:30.474 --> 27:33.042
- Well, she'’s hiding
and it'’s understandable.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.565
I hid when I was her age.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.480
I think every 14-year-old
kid does.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.482
But she entered into
this competition

27:38.526 --> 27:41.268
and I think she really
wants to win.

27:41.311 --> 27:43.574
And she won'’t win if she doesn't
engage with an audience.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.141
You know that.

27:45.185 --> 27:46.708
And I'’d say that
if she were six or 80.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.450
- Okay, yeah,
I'’ll talk to her.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.844
- And the thing is, is that
she did not show up

27:51.887 --> 27:54.020
for rehearsal this morning.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.717
- Oh, boy.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.632
- I'’m worried for
all of our sakes

27:57.676 --> 28:00.679
because it'’s not gonna be
good if she doesn'’t perform.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.031
- He comes over to me.

28:05.074 --> 28:06.467
And then he says,

28:06.510 --> 28:09.600
"I help my friends.
Are you my friend?"

28:09.644 --> 28:11.777
- Hmm. I swear the next time
I see that guy...

28:11.820 --> 28:13.996
- Oh, forget it.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.173
- Well, you should at
least report him, you know.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.697
Get it on record.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.176
- I'’ll handle it.

28:21.656 --> 28:24.311
- Make him an offer
he can'’t refuse.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.838
- I'’ll let you know
when I figure it out.

28:33.059 --> 28:38.412
- Hey, listen,
I'’m not taking her back.

28:38.455 --> 28:43.417
I can'’t keep having
her upend my life.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.201
I deserve to be happy.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.290
It'’s just complicated
because of Cadence.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.423
She'’s been with me full-time
for months now.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.034
And I just, I don'’t...

28:52.078 --> 28:54.863
I don'’t want her to be hurt
any more than she has to be.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.129
- You'’re a good man, Avery.

29:00.173 --> 29:03.002
You want everybody
to be happy.

29:03.045 --> 29:06.396
I'’m just not sure life
works out that way.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.014
- Hey.

29:15.057 --> 29:17.799
- Hey. Come in.

29:21.542 --> 29:24.632
I just made tea.
You want some?

29:24.675 --> 29:26.373
- Yeah, thanks.

29:26.416 --> 29:30.029
- Didn'’t think I'd be
seeing you any time soon.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.379
- Hey, listen. I'’m...

29:32.422 --> 29:34.773
I'’m really sorry for
the way I spoke to you.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.426
- It'’s okay.

29:36.470 --> 29:39.821
It'’s not my place to tell
you how to run your life.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.606
- I'’m gonna get help,
I promise.

29:42.650 --> 29:45.566
That'’s actually not
why I came by.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.482
I'’m trying to understand
something about you.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.529
- Okay.

29:52.573 --> 29:55.881
- So you went there to help
people and that'’s amazing,

29:55.924 --> 29:58.535
but it was different with me.

29:58.579 --> 30:00.102
I hoped at first
maybe you liked me.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.582
But we know that ain'’t true.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.105
- Oh, cut it out.

30:03.149 --> 30:05.325
- And if I were a mechanic
or if I were a teacher,

30:05.368 --> 30:07.066
I don'’t think you
would'’ve looked twice at me.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.502
- No.
I looked twice at you

30:08.545 --> 30:09.808
because you'’re an
incredible person.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.157
- See, that'’s it.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.941
Even if that were true,
and it ain'’t,

30:12.985 --> 30:14.987
you couldn'’t have known one
way or the other about me.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.379
Not when we first met.

30:16.423 --> 30:17.816
There'’s only one thing
you did know

30:17.859 --> 30:19.600
and that'’s the reason
you picked me.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.210
Is that I played music.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.211
- That'’s not true, though.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.996
- Yeah, it is true.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.128
It'’s what you care about,
Scarlett, whatever you say.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.130
And all this about trying
to get me back to playing,

30:28.174 --> 30:30.785
the person who needs
to be back onstage is you.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.961
- Well, that ain'’t happening.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.225
- Just ain'’t.

30:36.269 --> 30:39.663
- You know, this really smart
person, she once asked me,

30:39.707 --> 30:42.014
"What do you gain by
giving up the thing

30:42.057 --> 30:44.494
that you love the most?"

30:49.412 --> 30:51.110
- That'’s easy for you to say.

30:51.153 --> 30:55.201
- You can'’t be afraid
to speak your mind.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.768
And if he doesn'’t
like it, tough!

30:57.812 --> 30:59.901
It'’s your life, not his.

31:01.294 --> 31:03.339
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:03.383 --> 31:04.558
What'’s going on here?

31:04.601 --> 31:06.952
- Nothing.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.170
- Doesn'’t sound like nothing.

31:10.738 --> 31:14.133
Listen, Daphne, I got a
surprise visit from Ilse today.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.786
Said you didn'’t
show up to rehearsal.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.137
- Yeah, I'’m sorry.
I wasn'’t feeling well.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.400
- That'’s the first
I heard of that.

31:24.970 --> 31:28.582
- Listen to me, sweetheart.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.801
I got to say it really does
seem like she cares about you.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.803
She definitely expressed an
interest in you doing well.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.631
- Then why isn'’t
she listening to me?

31:36.068 --> 31:37.286
Or do you just not like
what she'’s saying?

31:38.548 --> 31:39.636
- I'’m not taking
her side, baby.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.160
I'’m on your team all the way.

31:41.203 --> 31:42.552
And, believe me,
I respect you as an artist.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.380
I'’m only saying that, you know,

31:44.424 --> 31:46.905
maybe there'’s some value
in what she'’s got to say.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.732
- I don'’t agree with you.

31:48.776 --> 31:51.648
- All right.
That'’s your choice.

31:56.479 --> 31:59.830
But I do have to say, and I hate
talking about stuff like this.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.223
But if you don'’t
show up tomorrow,

32:01.267 --> 32:02.355
you are in breach
of contract.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.009
You understand
what that means?

32:04.052 --> 32:05.271
- That'’s a lot of pressure
to put on a little girl.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.881
- You need to stop.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.491
- I never said I was quitting.
I'’ll go back.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.276
- Why do you have to be
so hard on her?

32:12.278 --> 32:13.844
- How dare you!

32:13.888 --> 32:15.324
How dare you!

32:15.368 --> 32:17.109
Has this world gone upside
down or something

32:17.152 --> 32:19.459
when you, of all people,
come into my house

32:19.502 --> 32:21.417
and tell my daughter
to talk back to me?

32:21.461 --> 32:22.897
- Dad...

32:22.941 --> 32:24.464
- When that would have
got my nose broken?

32:24.507 --> 32:26.161
You gonna do that?

32:26.205 --> 32:27.641
- Well, I heard you, Dad!
I was standing right there!

32:27.684 --> 32:29.164
- Dad...

32:29.208 --> 32:31.123
- You'’re gonna come back
after all these years

32:31.166 --> 32:32.254
you'’re gonna waltz in here
and act like you ain'’t the one

32:32.298 --> 32:33.255
that slit our family in pieces?

32:33.299 --> 32:34.387
Is that it?

32:34.430 --> 32:35.431
- He wasn'’t talking about you!

32:35.475 --> 32:38.434
He was talking about Brad!

32:38.478 --> 32:42.134
- I was telling her to speak
her mind to that jackass.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.012
- I'’m sorry, Dad.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.283
- I'’m a U.S. citizen,

33:01.327 --> 33:04.069
I was held against my will
by U.S. citizens,

33:04.112 --> 33:06.332
and this woman is in
danger by U.S. citizens!

33:06.375 --> 33:08.464
And if the State Department
can'’t be bothered

33:08.508 --> 33:11.119
to handle this,
then tell me who can!

33:11.163 --> 33:12.599
Okay?

33:12.642 --> 33:15.080
Because this is not
gonna stop here!

33:15.123 --> 33:17.082
All right, thank you.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.997
I will await his call.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.435
- I'’m sure
she'’ll be grateful.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.915
- Yeah, if I can get her out
and her son.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.354
- I'’m sure you will.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.313
- Don'’t move out.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.924
- I think it'’s best for now.

33:36.884 --> 33:39.060
- Please don'’t.
- It'’s okay.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.497
- It'’s too early to tell.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.022
- Fair enough.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.545
- Well, cut it out.
You know you'’re pissed.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.721
So let'’s just...
let'’s just have it out.

33:47.764 --> 33:50.463
- I'’m not pissed.
You'’re pissed.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.120
I'’m beyond pissed.
I wish I were pissed.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.947
If you could have seen me
at the airport with Cadence

33:56.991 --> 33:58.949
holding flowers when
you didn'’t bother to call

33:58.993 --> 34:01.648
and tell us you weren'’t
coming home, that was pissed!

34:01.691 --> 34:07.480
"Watch for Mommy",
I said, like an idiot.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.090
- I'’m sorry.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.831
If I could take
it all back, I would.

34:10.874 --> 34:12.789
- Do you understand that
I literally don'’t know

34:12.833 --> 34:14.182
if you'’re just
gonna turn around

34:14.226 --> 34:15.357
and go back to those people?

34:15.401 --> 34:17.664
I'’m suing them!

34:17.707 --> 34:21.233
And I'’m gonna free everybody
who'’s down there,

34:21.276 --> 34:22.495
if I can!

34:24.018 --> 34:25.976
- I should just...

34:26.020 --> 34:26.977
I gotta get my stuff.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.414
- Wait.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.372
Avery, please.

34:30.416 --> 34:34.115
I'’m not asking
anything of you, but...

34:36.596 --> 34:38.946
Please keep talking to me.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.037
- I'’ll try.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.866
That'’s all I can say.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.135
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, wow!

34:54.179 --> 34:56.311
Oh, that'’s super cool.
I love that!

34:56.355 --> 34:57.530
Kendall, you'’re a genius!

34:57.573 --> 34:58.661
- Thanks.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.359
- Hey, Daphne. Hey.
- Hi.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.012
- I'’m so glad you're here.

35:02.056 --> 35:05.538
- I'’m so sorry that
I didn'’t come yesterday.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.453
I know that was
really unprofessional.

35:07.496 --> 35:11.805
I just felt like I needed just
a minute to figure things out.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.242
- I understand.
So what did you come to?

35:14.286 --> 35:18.507
- I just can'’t be
something that I'’m not.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.813
- Then we'’ll do it your way.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.338
- Yeah, that'’s all right.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.340
I mean, I'’m on your team.
Don'’t forget that.

35:25.384 --> 35:30.215
Whatever you wanna do,
I'’ll support you.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.434
- You just don'’t think
I'’ll win if I don't?

35:32.478 --> 35:34.480
- I don'’t know.
Nobody knows.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.178
I just wanted the audience
to get to know you as I do.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.311
That'’s the only reason
I asked you to step out

35:39.354 --> 35:40.834
from behind your guitar.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.618
- I just don'’t think I can.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.881
- Then you won'’t.
It'’s okay.

35:44.925 --> 35:46.579
Okay?

35:49.799 --> 35:53.325
- Well, it'’s been a minute
since I was here last.

35:53.368 --> 35:56.502
See, despite all
the unimaginable things

35:56.545 --> 35:58.504
that have happened,
I have been sober

35:58.547 --> 36:00.245
a little over five years.

36:00.288 --> 36:03.073
So I come to think
maybe I was doing okay.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.902
Maybe I'’d gained a
little control over myself.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.383
Then my past came knocking.

36:08.427 --> 36:09.645
My dad...

36:12.474 --> 36:14.389
who was a terrible man.

36:14.433 --> 36:18.524
Now he'’s back and he's laughing
and joking with my daughters.

36:18.567 --> 36:22.092
Saying he'’s changed,
saying he'’s sober.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.660
And that he'’s sorry.

36:24.704 --> 36:29.187
I don'’t know if it's him
or me, but it'’s just...

36:29.230 --> 36:34.017
I'’m so mad at him that
I can'’t even think straight.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.802
You know, every little
thing he does,

36:35.845 --> 36:39.719
it just drives me
out of my mind.

36:39.762 --> 36:42.330
And then I think of all the
people that have forgiven me.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.637
You know, shown me grace
when I needed it.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.770
So I know I should forgive him.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.644
Maybe I just don'’t want to.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.254
- Why do you think
you don'’t want to?

36:57.302 --> 37:01.349
- '’Cause the people that he
hurt aren'’t here to speak now.

37:01.393 --> 37:06.528
If I forgive him,
then there'’s no one left

37:06.572 --> 37:08.922
to be a witness to what
he done to them.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.976
And to me,
to that boy I was.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.936
That boy that could not
defend himself.

37:22.979 --> 37:26.548
I guess I feel like
it'’s my job to remember

37:26.592 --> 37:31.031
'’cause if I don't, then, hell,
he just gets away with it.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.949
- But why do you need
to forgive him?

37:38.778 --> 37:43.826
- The hatred I feel for him
is like this armor

37:43.870 --> 37:48.004
I'’ve been wearing for as long
as I can remember.

37:51.399 --> 37:55.011
So long that I swear
to God I don'’t even know

37:55.055 --> 37:56.578
who I'’d be if I took it off.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.713
But I know when I look at
my daughters and I see them

38:00.756 --> 38:03.150
looking at me, that if
I don'’t take it off...

38:08.373 --> 38:09.809
Then I'’m the broken one.
