02:39.887 --> 02:41.752
Tracy!

02:41.823 --> 02:43.381
Tracy!

02:58.172 --> 02:59.298
Tracy!

02:59.374 --> 03:01.740
- How do you spell "omelet"?
- Oh, you.

03:01.809 --> 03:05.905
Ninety-four for the ceremony
and 506 for the reception.

03:05.980 --> 03:08.039
I don't know where
we'll put them if it rains.

03:08.116 --> 03:10.516
It won't rain.
Tracy won't stand for it.

03:10.585 --> 03:14.817
- Mother, how do you spell "omelet"?
- O-M-M-E-L-E-T.

03:14.889 --> 03:18.325
- I thought there was another "L."
- An omelet's a funny wedding present.

03:18.393 --> 03:22.261
- It was a silver dish, dear.
- Bring some of that junk off the table.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.764
Be an angel and get these
things out of the way.

03:24.832 --> 03:26.823
Yes, darling.

03:31.439 --> 03:32.872
This stinks.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.809
Don't say "stinks," darling.

03:35.877 --> 03:38.812
If absolutely necessary, "smells."

03:38.880 --> 03:40.905
These cards have
been changed again.

03:40.982 --> 03:44.975
There must be a ghost in the house,
the ghost of bridegroom number one.

03:45.053 --> 03:47.419
Don't talk about Dexter
as though he were dead.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.922
- He may as well be, for all Tracy cares.
- Right.

03:49.991 --> 03:51.322
I wouldn't say that.

03:51.392 --> 03:54.327
If I never see
Mr. C.K. Dexter Haven again, I'll be...

03:54.395 --> 03:56.727
- Isn't that awful?
- They're friends of your father's.

03:56.798 --> 04:00.928
What are they, tap dancers
or just musical comedy producers?

04:01.002 --> 04:03.732
That's hardly fair to your
father's interest in the art.

04:03.805 --> 04:07.901
Art, my eye! The art of putting up
$100,000 to display the shapely legs...

04:07.975 --> 04:10.705
- That will do, Tracy.
- I give up.

04:13.348 --> 04:16.283
If you'd just face the facts
squarely, as I did...

04:16.351 --> 04:20.810
We'd face the fact that neither of us
has proved to be a success as a wife.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.324
We just picked the wrong
first husbands, that's all.

04:24.392 --> 04:27.589
Don't let's argue about it.
You wanted me to take a stand, so I did.

04:27.662 --> 04:30.995
It's the only stand a woman could take
and keep her self-respect.

04:31.065 --> 04:32.828
Yes, dear, I know.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.801
Now I have my self-respect
and no husband.

04:35.870 --> 04:39.033
You almost talk as though
you wanted him back.

04:39.107 --> 04:40.972
He wouldn't come back, probably.

04:41.042 --> 04:44.443
Hey, it's better this way, really.
You'll see.

04:44.512 --> 04:48.539
Let's forget about the past. We both
deserve some happiness, especially you.

04:48.616 --> 04:50.379
- Darling.
- Isn't George an angel?

04:50.451 --> 04:52.851
- George is an angel.
- Is he handsome or is he not?

04:52.920 --> 04:54.012
George is handsome.

04:54.088 --> 04:57.580
- I liked Dexter.
- Why don't you postpone the wedding?

04:58.826 --> 05:00.259
- How?
- Get smallpox.

05:00.328 --> 05:03.263
- Don't put the idea in her head.
- George isn't usually late.

05:03.331 --> 05:05.595
- He's waiting at the stables.
- Waiting...

05:05.666 --> 05:09.102
- If I don't choke her before Saturday.
- It'd postpone the wedding.

05:09.170 --> 05:11.695
It would not.
Be in the car when I get down.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.474
She's so mean about Dexter.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.134
He was rather mean to her.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.644
- Did he really sock her?
- Please, Dinah.

05:18.713 --> 05:21.773
- Did he really?
- Darling, go out and wait in the car.

05:21.849 --> 05:24.409
- The papers were full of "innundo."
- Of what?

05:24.485 --> 05:27.545
Of "innundo."
"Cruelty and drunkenness," it said.

05:29.090 --> 05:33.550
Mother, why won't Tracy ask
her own father to the wedding?

05:33.628 --> 05:36.324
Your sister has very definite
opinions about certain things.

05:36.397 --> 05:37.887
She's sort of...

05:37.965 --> 05:41.401
Well, you know,
hard, isn't she?

05:41.469 --> 05:42.868
Certainly not.

05:42.937 --> 05:46.168
Tracy sets exceptionally high standards
for herself, that's all...

05:46.240 --> 05:49.676
and other people aren't always
quite apt to live up to them.

05:50.611 --> 05:54.707
But don't you think it's stinking
not at least to want Father?

05:54.782 --> 05:58.445
Yes, darling. Between ourselves,
I think it's good and stinking.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.920
Oh, I wish something would happen.

06:01.989 --> 06:05.390
Nothing ever possibly
in the least ever happens here.

06:07.261 --> 06:08.523
Mother...

06:09.397 --> 06:11.695
how do you get smallpox?

06:11.766 --> 06:14.530
Oh, Dinah, please go. Go.

06:29.717 --> 06:32.880
This is Uncle Willie's favorite:
Complete Surrender.

06:57.845 --> 07:00.780
Where'd you get this
idiotic thing anyway?

07:03.384 --> 07:06.581
Never play with fire, child,
particularly on the eve of your wedding.

07:06.654 --> 07:09.054
You're really a wicked old man,
aren't you?

07:09.123 --> 07:10.988
Who takes this, your cook?

07:11.058 --> 07:13.356
I love it. It's got
pictures of everything.

07:13.427 --> 07:15.429
It certainly has.

07:15.429 --> 07:15.656
It certainly has.

07:15.730 --> 07:20.190
Who is that terribly attractive man?
Can Tracy pick 'em, or can she?

07:20.268 --> 07:22.498
- If you're asking me...
- I'm not.

07:22.570 --> 07:25.095
- Hello, darling.
- Hello!

07:25.172 --> 07:28.699
- How do you like me?
- I adore you, but you look awful.

07:28.776 --> 07:31.267
- Awful?
- Like something out of a shop window.

07:35.516 --> 07:37.279
Cut it out!
They're new!

07:37.351 --> 07:39.581
They're new,
but they're not going to be.

07:39.654 --> 07:42.122
- There, that's better.
- I don't get it.

07:42.189 --> 07:45.158
When I was a coal miner, I wanted
enough money to buy clean clothes.

07:45.226 --> 07:46.853
Now that I'm general manager...

07:46.928 --> 07:50.125
Dinah, is there anything
in there about the wedding?

07:50.197 --> 07:52.324
- What do you mean?
- I thought maybe...

07:52.400 --> 07:55.494
you being one of the oldest
families in Philadelphia...

07:55.570 --> 07:57.800
and me getting fairly
important myself...

07:57.872 --> 08:00.966
it's luck, of course, but I...
What's the matter?

08:01.042 --> 08:03.533
"An average day in the life
of a congressman.

08:03.611 --> 08:06.102
"The congressman's wife.
The kitchen, where is prepared...

08:06.180 --> 08:08.273
"one banana, sliced,
two fried eggs.

08:08.349 --> 08:11.284
- "The congressman kisses his wife."
- Lots of people like publicity.

08:11.352 --> 08:15.311
Of all the filthy ideas, coming
into a private house with a camera.

08:16.424 --> 08:20.053
George Kittredge, you get on that horse.
What do you think of that?

08:20.127 --> 08:23.096
What would happen if someday
I got into politics?

08:23.164 --> 08:25.962
- You'd be elected President.
- I don't know about that.

08:26.033 --> 08:28.297
- I mean about publicity.
- Not in my home.

08:28.369 --> 08:30.496
You mean our home, don't you?

08:31.672 --> 08:35.073
Sorry, darling.
I mean very much our home.

08:43.017 --> 08:45.451
Never mind, Eddie.
I'll get up myself.

08:46.921 --> 08:48.411
Steady, Bessie.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.153
Whoa, Bessie. Whoa.

09:00.668 --> 09:02.260
Steady, Bessie.

09:03.437 --> 09:06.270
Grab the reins, George,
with the left hand.

09:08.442 --> 09:10.933
- Put salt on his tail.
- Shut up.

09:11.012 --> 09:12.445
Steady, Bessie.

09:13.648 --> 09:15.639
There. Whoa, Bessie.

09:17.351 --> 09:19.785
What's the matter, Bessie?
You act worried.

09:19.854 --> 09:21.879
Maybe it's because his name is Jack.

09:24.759 --> 09:26.750
Hi-ho, Silver.

09:39.974 --> 09:42.033
That does the trick.
Hello, Joe.

09:42.109 --> 09:43.633
- Hi, Mike.
- I won't do it, Liz.

09:43.711 --> 09:47.875
I'm gonna tell Sidney Kidd very plainly
I'm a writer, not a society snoop.

09:47.948 --> 09:50.781
- I'm gonna tell him just that.
- Just that.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.654
Let Kidd fire me!

09:54.722 --> 09:57.919
Start writin' short stories again.
That's what I should be doin'.

09:57.992 --> 10:00.517
- I'm gonna tell him just that.
- Just that.

10:06.667 --> 10:07.827
Come in.

10:16.977 --> 10:19.343
- I don't think you're being fair.
- No?

10:19.413 --> 10:21.904
You're treating me like you
treat all your other writers.

10:24.018 --> 10:26.179
You really hate me,
don't you, Connor?

10:26.253 --> 10:29.188
No. I don't like you
very much, though.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.120
You hate me, I trust,
Miss Imbrie?

10:33.194 --> 10:36.857
No. I can't afford to hate anybody.
I'm only a photographer.

10:40.101 --> 10:41.625
Ask him to wait.

10:42.870 --> 10:46.135
Your assignment will be Spy's
most sensational achievement:

10:46.207 --> 10:48.505
Tracy Lord.

10:48.576 --> 10:51.602
Big game hunting in Africa,
fox hunting in Pennsylvania...

10:51.679 --> 10:54.113
married on impulse
and divorced in a rage...

10:54.181 --> 10:57.344
and always unapproachable
by the press.

10:57.418 --> 10:59.579
"The Unapproachable Miss Lord."

11:00.654 --> 11:02.952
"The Philadelphia Story."

11:03.023 --> 11:06.823
"Closed were the portals
of snobbish fox hunting." No.

11:06.894 --> 11:09.590
"No hunter of foxes
is Spy magazine."

11:09.663 --> 11:12.291
Anyway, presented for
the first time, quote:

11:12.366 --> 11:16.166
"A wedding day
inside mainline society."

11:16.237 --> 11:20.173
"Or what the kitchen maid saw
through the keyhole." Unquote.

11:20.241 --> 11:22.607
Writing's your job.
I'm only the publisher.

11:22.676 --> 11:25.338
All right, publisher,
take this. Quote:

11:25.412 --> 11:29.405
"No hunter of buckshot in the rear
is cagey, crafty Connor."

11:29.483 --> 11:32.111
Unquote. Close paragraph.

11:32.186 --> 11:34.848
Close job.
Close bank account.

11:36.190 --> 11:39.591
But how can we possibly get inside
the Lord estate, let alone the house?

11:39.660 --> 11:42.026
We're not gonna do it,
doggone it!

11:42.096 --> 11:44.030
It's degrading!
It's undignified!

11:44.098 --> 11:46.430
So is an empty stomach.
How do we get in?

11:51.272 --> 11:53.467
Ask the gentleman to come in.

12:03.551 --> 12:06.611
- I understand we understand each other.
- Quite.

12:06.687 --> 12:09.622
This gentleman has been employed
in our Buenos Aires office.

12:09.690 --> 12:11.988
Fortunately, he came up
yesterday on the clipper...

12:12.059 --> 12:14.789
and I believe he can
help us with our problem.

12:14.862 --> 12:16.124
How?

12:16.197 --> 12:19.564
Tracy Lord's brother Junius is
in the American embassy down there...

12:19.633 --> 12:22.295
and he's an old friend
of this gentleman's.

12:22.369 --> 12:25.668
He'll introduce you to the Lords
as intimate friends of Junius.

12:25.739 --> 12:27.400
Dear old Junius.

12:27.474 --> 12:30.375
This Tracy Lord,
does she know you?

12:30.444 --> 12:32.810
You might say Miss Lord and I
grew up together.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.111
You might also say
you were her first husband.

12:36.183 --> 12:37.445
Yes, you might.

12:37.518 --> 12:40.043
Holy mackerel.
What goes on here?

12:40.120 --> 12:43.988
I remember your honeymoon very well,
you and she on a little sailboat.

12:44.058 --> 12:47.357
- The True Love, wasn't it?
- How did you know?

12:47.428 --> 12:50.363
I was the only photographer
whose camera you didn't smash.

12:50.431 --> 12:53.889
You were terribly nice about it.
You threw it in the ocean.

12:53.968 --> 12:55.868
One of those, huh?

12:55.936 --> 12:59.030
Yes, I had the strange idea
our honeymoon was our own business.

12:59.106 --> 13:03.566
Incidentally, he paid for the cameras.
I got a nice letter of apology too.

13:03.644 --> 13:05.305
Always the gentleman, huh?

13:05.379 --> 13:07.244
Except on occasion.

13:07.314 --> 13:09.248
Now, what are the plans?

13:09.316 --> 13:12.012
The wedding's Saturday.
Today is Thursday.

13:12.086 --> 13:14.520
They should spend tomorrow night
as guests of the Lords.

13:14.588 --> 13:16.579
There's somethin' screwy here.

13:16.657 --> 13:20.753
If you've resigned, why are you
doin' all this unless you...

13:22.997 --> 13:25.795
You wanna get even
with your ex-bride, huh?

13:27.368 --> 13:30.804
I'll have a car pick them up
at noon tomorrow in north Philadelphia.

13:35.743 --> 13:39.008
Mike, there's spit in your eye.
It shows.

13:56.497 --> 13:58.988
Maybe they'd rather we go around
to the servants' entrance.

13:59.066 --> 14:01.330
Maybe this is
the servants' entrance.

14:09.843 --> 14:13.142
- Good morning, Edward.
- Why, Mr. Haven!

14:13.213 --> 14:16.649
Is Mrs. Haven... I mean,
Miss Tracy or her mother in?

14:16.717 --> 14:20.517
They may be at the swimming pool, sir.
Shall I announce you?

14:20.587 --> 14:23.283
No. I'll go around myself
and surprise them.

14:23.357 --> 14:25.825
It will indeed
be a surprise, sir.

14:25.893 --> 14:28.691
These are friends of Mr. Junius's.
Have them wait in the south parlor.

14:28.762 --> 14:30.354
Certainly, Mr. Haven.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.532
Excuse me, sir.

14:46.547 --> 14:48.037
The south parlor?

14:48.115 --> 14:50.208
Miss Imbrie, the south parlor.

14:51.585 --> 14:54.952
The queen will have bread and honey
at the usual time.

15:02.096 --> 15:05.088
Seems a little cold
for the south parlor.

15:06.367 --> 15:09.564
I'd rather expected to find
pickaninnies and banjos.

15:14.074 --> 15:17.100
What's this room?
I forgot my compass.

15:20.948 --> 15:24.611
This would be south-southwest
parlor by living room.

15:24.685 --> 15:27.347
Knickknacks, gimcracks,
signed photographs.

15:27.421 --> 15:30.652
You'd have to be as rich as the Lords
to live in a dump like this.

15:30.724 --> 15:33.659
- I wouldn't live in it if they paid me.
- They won't.

15:44.371 --> 15:47.033
Looks like they run
a hockshop on the side.

16:10.197 --> 16:12.131
Just lookin' around.

16:35.489 --> 16:37.753
I'll want your fingerprints for this.

16:40.761 --> 16:44.629
Hey, what's this...
What's this guy Haven up to?

16:44.698 --> 16:46.427
C.K. Dexter Haven.

16:46.500 --> 16:50.266
What kind of a name is that?
C.K. Dexter Haven.

16:50.337 --> 16:52.931
Macaulay Connor's
no homespun tag, my pet.

16:53.006 --> 16:55.634
Yeah, you just try
callin' me Macaulay.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.472
I knew a plain Joe Smith once.

16:57.544 --> 17:01.310
He was only a clerk in a hardware store,
but he was an absolute rat.

17:04.417 --> 17:06.181
C.K. Dexter Haven.

17:06.252 --> 17:10.383
He plays polo, he designs
sailboats, "class" boats.

17:10.457 --> 17:13.085
- Very upper class.
- Don't despair.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.526
He's out. Kittredge,
man of the people, is in.

17:15.596 --> 17:18.656
Quite a comer too, I understand.
Political timber.

17:18.732 --> 17:20.825
Poor guy. I wonder
how he fell for it.

17:20.901 --> 17:24.268
Uh-oh, Liz. What did I tell you?
How do you like this?

17:24.338 --> 17:28.104
"Living room, sitting room,
terrace, pool, stables."

17:28.175 --> 17:31.110
That's so they can talk to the horses
without having them in the house.

17:32.179 --> 17:33.612
Don't, Mike!

17:40.287 --> 17:41.219
Yes?

17:41.288 --> 17:43.017
This is the bridal suite.

17:43.090 --> 17:45.718
Send up some caviar sandwiches
and a bottle of beer.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.555
What? Who is this?

17:47.628 --> 17:50.358
This is the voice of doom calling.

17:50.430 --> 17:54.264
Your days are numbered,
to the seventh son of the seventh son!

17:57.471 --> 18:00.338
- Hello? Hello?
- What's the matter?

18:00.407 --> 18:02.910
One of the servants
has been at the sherry again.

18:06.246 --> 18:09.773
- Dexter, you've come back!
- Ah, Dinah, my dream girl!

18:09.850 --> 18:11.784
What in the name of...

18:13.187 --> 18:16.850
No, it can't be. He went to
South America for two years.

18:16.924 --> 18:19.586
Edward said they were
at the swimming pool.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.093
They seem to be here.

18:24.665 --> 18:28.157
Dexter, don't you know
that tomorrow is the wedding?

18:28.235 --> 18:30.260
Oh, that's right.
So it is.

18:31.572 --> 18:34.871
You can go right back
where you came from!

18:34.942 --> 18:37.376
Can't. Dinah says it's
awful here without me.

18:37.444 --> 18:39.537
Hello, you sweet thing.

18:39.613 --> 18:41.808
Red, you look in the pink.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.517
You don't think I'd miss
your wedding, do you?

18:45.586 --> 18:48.987
- Dexter, you wouldn't.
- I'm not so sure he wouldn't.

18:49.056 --> 18:52.025
No, Mother Lord, I wouldn't.
I assure you I wouldn't.

18:52.092 --> 18:54.686
- Tell us all about Junius.
- Stay 'til lunch.

18:54.761 --> 18:58.788
Don't open your house. Stay here.
We're having no guests over the wedding.

19:00.534 --> 19:03.128
- How about the groom?
- He's staying at the gatehouse.

19:03.203 --> 19:04.534
Oh, that's good.

19:04.605 --> 19:06.835
- Junius is fine.
- He should be here.

19:06.907 --> 19:09.569
He's heartbroken. I suggested
representing him as best man...

19:09.643 --> 19:13.443
I'm afraid that George might prefer
to have his best man sober.

19:13.513 --> 19:15.174
I wish you'd represent George.

19:15.249 --> 19:18.650
That's my loyal little girl.
You'll like the people Junius did send.

19:18.719 --> 19:21.745
You haven't switched from liquor
to dope, by any chance?

19:21.822 --> 19:24.120
- You see?
- The people Junius did send?

19:24.191 --> 19:27.092
You don't know a Macaulay Connor
or Elizabeth Imbrie, do you?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.754
- We can finish these later.
- I'd better introduce you.

19:29.830 --> 19:33.732
Call me for...
Introduce me to whom?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.769
To Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor,
to tell them which rooms they'd have.

19:36.837 --> 19:40.671
Mr. Connor is asking if he should wear
a black or white tie to tonight's party.

19:40.741 --> 19:44.302
- Rooms?
- I'd better start from the beginning.

19:44.378 --> 19:47.040
Sit down, dear.
They're great friends of Junius's.

19:47.114 --> 19:50.311
And they expect to stay here?
I think that's very queer.

19:50.384 --> 19:53.217
I think it's queerer than that.
I think it's paranoiac.

19:53.287 --> 19:56.723
You see, it was Junius's idea.
They've been very kind to him, and...

19:56.790 --> 19:59.657
You're lying, Dexter.
I can always tell.

19:59.726 --> 20:01.660
- Can you, Red?
- They're Junius's friends.

20:01.728 --> 20:04.196
You went to work after
the divorce, didn't you?

20:04.264 --> 20:07.062
Yes, except for a brief interlude
in some alcoholic sanitariums.

20:07.134 --> 20:09.329
You took a job
in South America. Who for?

20:09.403 --> 20:12.099
- A magazine.
- It wasn't Spy magazine?

20:12.172 --> 20:13.901
You are a mass of intuition.

20:13.974 --> 20:17.102
I don't suppose that Junius's
friends are photographers?

20:17.177 --> 20:19.668
- I thought you were low, but I never...
- What are you going to do?

20:19.746 --> 20:22.681
- After I've telephoned Junius...
- Wait, Red.

20:22.749 --> 20:24.740
Don't telephone Junius.
I'll confess.

20:30.524 --> 20:32.719
No. You're slipping, Red.

20:32.793 --> 20:36.752
I used to be afraid of that look,
the withering glance of the goddess.

20:36.830 --> 20:39.390
I didn't think that alcohol would...
Oh, shut up.

20:42.135 --> 20:43.466
Dinah, stay here.

20:43.537 --> 20:46.097
Please, Mother.
Maybe he's going to sock her.

20:46.173 --> 20:50.132
Don't say "sock," darling.
"Strike" is quite an ugly enough word.

20:51.845 --> 20:54.279
Who do they think they are,
barging in on peaceful people?

20:54.348 --> 20:58.079
- They'll think you don't want them.
- I want them out, and you too!

20:58.151 --> 21:01.780
Yes, your majesty. But first could I
interest you in some small blackmail?

21:03.290 --> 21:07.056
It's an article, complete with
snapshots, details and insinuations...

21:07.127 --> 21:09.561
and it's ready for
publication in Spy...

21:09.629 --> 21:12.097
and it's about your father
and that dancer in New York.

21:12.165 --> 21:14.133
About Father and Tina Mara?

21:14.201 --> 21:16.533
Quiet. Dinah.

21:16.603 --> 21:19.936
But they can't,
even if it's true.

21:21.241 --> 21:24.039
- Where do you get these?
- From Sidney Kidd, editor and publisher.

21:24.111 --> 21:27.740
- He's got to be stopped.
- He is, temporarily.

21:27.814 --> 21:31.250
That is, if you'll allow those two
to turn in the story on your wedding.

21:31.318 --> 21:34.344
And when Kidd says a story,
he means a story.

21:34.421 --> 21:36.184
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Yes, dear.

21:36.256 --> 21:38.986
"An Intimate Day
With a Society Bride."

21:39.059 --> 21:40.492
I am sick.

21:41.495 --> 21:43.554
It's tough, but that's
the way it seems to be.

21:43.630 --> 21:46.531
So I'm to be examined, undressed
and generally humiliated...

21:46.600 --> 21:48.568
at 15 cents a copy.

21:48.635 --> 21:51.661
And you, you...
You're loving it.

21:51.738 --> 21:53.262
Am I, Red?

21:59.045 --> 22:00.478
Mother, we're hooked.

22:00.547 --> 22:02.947
- Are they really reporters?
- Not even friends of Junius's?

22:03.016 --> 22:05.644
They aren't anybody's friends,
but we're to pretend they are.

22:05.719 --> 22:07.209
- But why?
- Don't ask me.

22:07.287 --> 22:09.847
There's a good reason,
and it's my wedding, so please!

22:09.923 --> 22:12.517
I'll bet it's on account
of Father and that dancer.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.083
- Dinah, what do you know?
- I listen around.

22:15.162 --> 22:17.687
Is there no such thing
as privacy anymore?

22:17.764 --> 22:20.232
Only in bed, Mother,
and not always there.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.564
Watching every little mannerism...

22:22.636 --> 22:25.298
jotting down notes on how we sit,
stand, talk, eat and move!

22:25.372 --> 22:29.240
- Will they do that?
- All in that horrible, snide English.

22:29.309 --> 22:32.472
If we have to submit to it
to save Father's face...

22:32.546 --> 22:34.605
which, incidentally,
doesn't deserve it...

22:34.681 --> 22:38.014
I'll give them a picture of home life
that'll stand their hair on end!

22:39.386 --> 22:43.049
Tracy, we must just be ourselves,
very much ourselves.

22:43.123 --> 22:45.921
But you want us to create
a good impression, don't you?

22:45.992 --> 22:48.324
They don't know that we know
what they're here for?

22:48.395 --> 22:50.761
No. That was understood.
The girl's quite nice.

22:50.831 --> 22:53.163
He writes short stories.
Very down to earth.

22:53.233 --> 22:56.134
- They'll love us.
- Oh, dear, you'd both better dress.

22:56.203 --> 23:00.264
And both of you, promise to behave
like ladies in front of these creatures.

23:00.340 --> 23:03.798
We'll do our best, Mrs. Lord.
I don't know how good that is.

23:08.482 --> 23:11.781
Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.

23:11.852 --> 23:15.288
What'll they say about Seth not being
here for his own daughter's wedding?

23:18.158 --> 23:19.591
I know, dear.

23:22.929 --> 23:26.922
You'd better go and tell them how
terribly happy we are to have them.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.525
That's the old Quaker spirit,
Mother Lord.

23:29.603 --> 23:31.195
Keep swinging.

23:38.311 --> 23:40.871
Oh. I thought it was that butler.

23:40.947 --> 23:43.040
The family will be down
to welcome you.

23:43.116 --> 23:45.107
- What with?
- With open arms.

23:45.185 --> 23:47.847
They're terribly happy to have
any friends of Junius's here.

23:47.921 --> 23:50.014
- Do they know about us?
- Why should they?

23:50.090 --> 23:54.424
Look, Haven, our research department
didn't give us much data.

23:54.494 --> 23:58.521
This fiancé of this girl,
George Kittredge, age 32?

23:58.598 --> 24:00.759
- You know him very well?
- Well enough.

24:00.834 --> 24:05.134
"General manager of Quaker State Coal,
company owned by Seth Lord."

24:05.205 --> 24:07.935
- That's the girl's father, huh?
- What a coincidence.

24:08.008 --> 24:09.771
How'd he meet her?

24:09.843 --> 24:12.277
Heaven brought them together,
I imagine.

24:13.947 --> 24:15.380
"Seth Lord.

24:15.448 --> 24:18.440
"See Banker's Annual,
Directory of Directors."

24:18.518 --> 24:20.543
- Is there a library in town?
- Yes.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.611
I suppose you wouldn't
know where that is?

24:22.689 --> 24:25.681
Well, roughly.
My grandfather built it.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.356
Now, about this girl...

24:31.431 --> 24:34.195
"Tracy Samantha Lord."

24:34.267 --> 24:35.700
What about her?

24:35.769 --> 24:38.329
Well, what's her
leading characteristic?

24:38.405 --> 24:41.465
She has a horror of men
who wear their hats in the house.

24:43.543 --> 24:46.103
Leading characteristics
to be filled in later.

24:46.179 --> 24:48.545
I can fill them in right now.

24:48.615 --> 24:52.415
The young, rich, rapacious
American female.

24:52.485 --> 24:54.419
No other country
where she exists.

24:54.487 --> 24:57.081
And would I change places
with Tracy Samantha Lord...

24:57.157 --> 24:59.682
for all her wealth and beauty?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.125
Oh, boy, just ask me.

25:03.330 --> 25:06.822
Well, tell four footmen to call me
in time for lunch, will you?

25:15.375 --> 25:17.104
How do you do?

25:18.278 --> 25:20.769
Friends of my brother Junius,
are you not?

25:20.847 --> 25:22.144
I am Dinah Lord.

25:22.215 --> 25:24.513
My real name is Diana,
but my sister changed it.

25:24.584 --> 25:26.779
I'm Elizabeth Imbrie.
This is Macaulay Connor.

25:26.853 --> 25:31.051
Enchantée de vous voir!
Enchantée de faire votre connaissance!

25:31.124 --> 25:33.092
I spoke French
before I spoke English.

25:33.159 --> 25:36.390
My early childhood was spent in Paris
where my father worked in a bank:

25:36.463 --> 25:38.192
- The House of Morgan.
- Really?

25:38.264 --> 25:40.357
C'est vrai absolument!

25:40.433 --> 25:44.130
Can you play the piano?
I can, and sing at the same time!

25:44.204 --> 25:45.637
Listen.

25:54.948 --> 25:57.746
Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia

25:57.817 --> 26:00.877
Oh, Lydia
the tattooed lady

26:00.954 --> 26:03.787
She has eyes
that folks adore so

26:03.857 --> 26:07.020
And a torso even more so

26:07.093 --> 26:09.323
What is this?

26:09.396 --> 26:10.829
Idiot, probably.

26:10.897 --> 26:12.592
The queen of tattoos

26:12.666 --> 26:15.829
On her back
is the battle of Waterloo

26:15.902 --> 26:18.564
Beside it the wreck
of the Hesperus too

26:18.638 --> 26:22.404
And proudly above
waves the red, white

26:22.475 --> 26:24.340
And blue

26:24.411 --> 26:28.142
You can learn a lot from Lydia

26:28.214 --> 26:31.308
Ah, petite soeur,
tu es un véritable petit Chopin!

26:31.384 --> 26:32.976
- Tu trouves?
- Mais certainement.

26:33.053 --> 26:36.079
Mais qu'est-ce qu'il y a?
Voyons, tu es pâle.

26:36.156 --> 26:39.922
Montre-moi ta langue. J'espere bien
que ce n'est pas le smallpox.

26:39.993 --> 26:41.654
- Le smallpox?
- Mais oui.

26:41.728 --> 26:43.662
Va dire a maman de se dépecher!

26:48.735 --> 26:51.465
Oh. How do you do?

26:53.106 --> 26:54.937
I'm Tracy Lord.

26:55.008 --> 26:57.909
It's so nice having you here.
How did you leave Junius?

26:57.977 --> 27:00.275
We left Junius fine.
That little sister of yours...

27:00.346 --> 27:02.473
Isn't she a dear?
So talented.

27:02.549 --> 27:06.110
- Junius is such a lamb, isn't he?
- Yes, isn't he?

27:06.186 --> 27:10.555
It's a pity none of the male members
of the family are going to be here.

27:10.623 --> 27:13.717
- Where's your father?
- Darling Papa.

27:13.793 --> 27:16.489
- I do hope you'll stay for my wedding.
- We'd like to very much.

27:16.563 --> 27:19.623
- That was our idea.
- I'm so glad that it occurred to you.

27:19.699 --> 27:22.259
The house is in rather
a mess, of course.

27:22.335 --> 27:26.294
We'll all have to huddle here
and overflow onto the porch.

27:28.842 --> 27:31.970
- I hope your rooms are comfortable.
- Your father sick?

27:33.446 --> 27:36.882
- What a cunning little camera.
- I'm an awful nuisance with it.

27:36.950 --> 27:39.544
But you couldn't be.
I hope you'll take loads.

27:39.619 --> 27:42.417
Dear Papa and Mama aren't
allowing any reporters in.

27:42.489 --> 27:46.186
That is, except for little Mr. Grace,
who does the social news.

27:46.259 --> 27:48.989
Can you imagine a grown-up man
having to sink so low?

27:49.062 --> 27:51.587
It does seem kind of bad.

27:53.133 --> 27:55.567
You're a kind of writer...

27:55.635 --> 27:58.229
- aren't you, Mr. Connor?
- Sort of.

27:58.304 --> 27:59.771
- A book?
- Yes.

27:59.839 --> 28:02.103
Under what name do you publish?

28:02.175 --> 28:05.042
My own. Macaulay Connor.

28:06.346 --> 28:08.814
What's the Macaulay for?

28:08.882 --> 28:11.180
Well, my father
taught English history.

28:11.251 --> 28:13.310
I'm "Mike" to my friends.

28:13.386 --> 28:16.184
Of whom you have many, I'm sure.

28:16.256 --> 28:18.781
English history,
it's always fascinated me:

28:18.858 --> 28:21.452
Cromwell, Robin Hood,
Jack the Ripper.

28:21.528 --> 28:24.258
Where did he teach?
I mean, your father.

28:24.330 --> 28:26.798
In a little high school
in South Bend, Indiana.

28:26.866 --> 28:28.333
South Bend.

28:28.401 --> 28:30.801
It sounds like dancing,
doesn't it?

28:30.870 --> 28:33.395
You must have had a most
happy childhood there.

28:33.473 --> 28:35.498
- Yeah, it was terrific.
- I'm so glad.

28:35.575 --> 28:38.510
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I'm so sorry. Why?

28:38.578 --> 28:41.547
Well, lack of wherewithal,
I guess.

28:41.614 --> 28:44.947
But that doesn't always cause
unhappiness, does it?

28:45.018 --> 28:46.679
Not if you're
the right kind of man.

28:46.753 --> 28:50.314
George Kittredge, my fiancé,
never had anything either, and he...

28:50.390 --> 28:51.880
Are either of you married?

28:54.961 --> 28:56.895
You mean you were,
but now you're divorced.

28:56.963 --> 28:59.796
- The fact is...
- Surely you're not ashamed of it.

28:59.866 --> 29:02.232
- Of course I'm not.
- What?

29:02.302 --> 29:05.294
It was years ago.
I was only a kid in Duluth.

29:05.371 --> 29:07.464
Good heavens, Liz.
You never told me.

29:07.540 --> 29:10.441
- You never asked me.
- I know, but you...

29:11.911 --> 29:13.879
Joe Smith, hardware.

29:15.448 --> 29:18.417
You're the darnedest girl, Liz.

29:18.484 --> 29:19.917
I think I'm sweet.

29:22.155 --> 29:25.318
Duluth must be a lovely spot.
It's west of here, isn't it?

29:25.391 --> 29:28.189
Sort of, but occasionally
we get the breezes...

29:28.261 --> 29:30.695
And this is your first visit
in Philadelphia.

29:30.763 --> 29:33.527
It's a quaint old place,
don't you think? Filled with relics.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.591
And how old are you, Mr. Connor?

29:35.668 --> 29:36.794
Thirty.

29:36.870 --> 29:38.804
One book isn't much
for a man of 30.

29:38.872 --> 29:40.271
I don't mean to criticize.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.740
You probably have other interests
outside your work.

29:42.809 --> 29:44.276
None.

29:44.344 --> 29:45.902
I mean us.

29:47.113 --> 29:48.478
How sweet.

29:48.548 --> 29:51.039
Are you going together?

29:53.253 --> 29:56.086
- I beg your pardon?
- That is an odd question.

29:56.155 --> 29:59.522
I don't see why.
I think it's very interesting.

30:00.793 --> 30:02.988
Miss Imbrie, don't you agree...

30:03.062 --> 30:05.758
that if a man says he loves a girl,
he ought to marry her?

30:05.832 --> 30:07.197
Can she be human?

30:07.267 --> 30:09.895
Please, Mr. Connor.
I asked Miss Imbrie a question.

30:09.969 --> 30:11.527
Well, that depends. L...

30:11.604 --> 30:13.196
I'll see what's keeping Mama.

30:23.316 --> 30:25.716
Who's doing the interviewing here?

30:26.853 --> 30:29.947
- You don't suppose she caught on?
- No, she was born that way.

30:30.023 --> 30:32.389
- Don't let her throw ya.
- Do you want to take over?

30:32.458 --> 30:35.655
- I wanna go home.
- Ah, here you are.

30:35.728 --> 30:38.128
How do you do?
We're so happy to have you.

30:38.197 --> 30:41.792
Forgive me for not coming in sooner,
but things are in such a state.

30:41.868 --> 30:43.301
My little girl.

30:44.404 --> 30:46.099
She's going to leave me.

30:46.172 --> 30:50.165
Aren't you pretty, my dear.
But then Junius's friends always are.

30:50.243 --> 30:52.643
Look at the way
she wears her hair, Tracy.

30:52.712 --> 30:55.340
- Isn't it pretty?
- Mighty fine.

30:57.784 --> 30:59.718
Shall we have sherry on the porch?

31:06.259 --> 31:09.387
- This is my youngest daughter, Diana.
- I think we've met.

31:09.462 --> 31:12.556
I wish my husband could be here.
We expect him presently.

31:12.632 --> 31:16.398
He's detained in New York on business
for that lovely dancer, Tina Mara.

31:16.469 --> 31:18.733
- Do you know her work?
- Not professionally.

31:18.805 --> 31:20.796
So talented,
and such a lovely person...

31:20.873 --> 31:23.467
but like so many artists,
no business head.

31:23.543 --> 31:24.840
None whatever.

31:24.911 --> 31:27.846
I have some lovely presents,
don't you think so, Mr. Connor?

31:38.091 --> 31:39.388
Hello, everybody.

31:41.828 --> 31:44.228
- I hope I'm not late.
- You're never late, George.

31:44.297 --> 31:49.530
We have a lovely surprise. Junius has
sent these people as a wedding present.

31:49.602 --> 31:52.366
Mr. Kittredge,
this is Miss... I'm so sorry.

31:52.438 --> 31:54.599
- Imbrie.
- Any friend of Junius's is my friend.

31:54.674 --> 31:56.608
And, uh, Mr. Morrow?

31:56.676 --> 31:58.541
- I didn't get the name.
- Connor.

31:58.611 --> 32:00.806
Macauley Connor.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.869
He's a writer.

32:01.948 --> 32:03.313
Don't apologize, Mrs. Lord.

32:03.383 --> 32:05.749
No apology necessary.
I have great respect for writers.

32:05.818 --> 32:07.843
Well, thank you.
Any kind word is...

32:07.920 --> 32:10.388
- How are you?
- Much better now that you're here.

32:10.456 --> 32:12.686
Oh, I guess this
must be love, huh?

32:12.759 --> 32:16.092
- Your guess is correct.
- I'm just his faithful old dog Tray.

32:16.162 --> 32:18.562
- Give me your paw.
- You've got it.

32:19.565 --> 32:21.055
How sweet.

32:22.135 --> 32:24.126
Say, I'd like to see
one of those, Miss Imbrie.

32:24.203 --> 32:25.431
You will.

32:25.505 --> 32:27.097
Shall we have some sherry?

32:27.173 --> 32:30.438
I suppose Junius has told you
all about our happy little family.

32:30.510 --> 32:33.070
- Papa!
- What?

32:34.580 --> 32:37.140
Dear Papa.

32:39.085 --> 32:42.020
You angel to get here
in time for lunch!

32:42.088 --> 32:44.352
- Isn't he, Mama?
- Indeed he is, but...

32:44.424 --> 32:46.858
Father, these are our friends,
Miss Imbrie and Mr. Connor.

32:46.926 --> 32:50.987
- How are you, Mr. Lord?
- Oh, just fine, thank you.

32:51.064 --> 32:52.998
- How are you?
- How do you do?

32:53.066 --> 32:54.363
How do you do?

32:54.434 --> 32:55.833
Howdy, Pops.

32:55.902 --> 32:57.494
Oh, dear Dinah.

32:58.738 --> 33:01.366
- Father, here's George.
- How are you, Kittredge?

33:01.441 --> 33:02.772
Margaret, my sweet.

33:02.842 --> 33:05.936
- Another place for luncheon, Edward.
- Very good, madam.

33:06.913 --> 33:09.746
Well... here I am...

33:09.816 --> 33:11.750
in the bosom of my...

33:11.818 --> 33:14.082
- Hello, friends and enemies.
- Young man!

33:15.721 --> 33:17.484
- Remove yourself.
- How are you, sir?

33:17.557 --> 33:19.889
I don't know. Get along.

33:19.959 --> 33:21.893
Darling, I've changed my mind.
I will stay for lunch.

33:21.961 --> 33:23.588
Another place, Edward.

33:23.663 --> 33:26.029
- Hello, Kittredge.
- How are you, Haven?

33:26.099 --> 33:27.726
Just Damon and Pythias.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.098
No, Grant and Lee.

33:36.909 --> 33:39.844
You don't look as well as when
I last saw you, Kittredge.

33:39.912 --> 33:42.847
Oh, you poor fellow.
I know just how you feel.

33:44.083 --> 33:46.551
- How's it coming?
- Beautifully, Dexter.

33:46.619 --> 33:50.316
We're so indebted to you
for these lovely people.

33:50.389 --> 33:52.857
It's almost impossible
to repay that debt.

33:52.925 --> 33:54.859
But you'll manage, eh, Red?

33:56.562 --> 33:59.759
- They grew up together, you know.
- How nice.

33:59.832 --> 34:01.857
You don't look old enough
to get married...

34:01.934 --> 34:03.993
not even the first time,
but then you never did.

34:04.070 --> 34:06.937
She needs trouble to mature her,
Kittredge. Give her lots of it.

34:07.006 --> 34:09.167
I'm afraid she can't
count on me for that.

34:09.242 --> 34:11.107
No? That's too bad.

34:11.177 --> 34:13.940
For your own sake, Red,
you should have stuck to me longer.

34:14.013 --> 34:17.244
I thought it was for life, but the nice
judge gave me a full pardon.

34:17.315 --> 34:20.478
Ah, that's the old redhead.
No bitterness, no recrimination.

34:20.553 --> 34:22.748
Just a good swift left to the jaw.

34:26.726 --> 34:28.853
They grew up together.

34:30.897 --> 34:32.831
Luncheon is served, madam.

34:32.899 --> 34:36.062
Oh, thank you, Edward. Come sit.
We have so much to talk about.

34:36.135 --> 34:40.868
I don't suppose a man ever had
a better or finer family.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.033
I often wake up in the night
and say to myself...

34:43.109 --> 34:46.545
"Seth, you lucky dog,
what have you done to deserve it all?"

34:46.612 --> 34:48.101
And what have you?

34:52.985 --> 34:54.350
Oh, thank you.

34:57.757 --> 35:00.351
Oh, how stupid of me!

35:01.294 --> 35:04.092
Oh, dear! How awful!

35:04.163 --> 35:06.097
I had a feeling
that would happen.

35:06.165 --> 35:09.760
Your camera.
I'm so, so sorry.

35:09.835 --> 35:11.325
I'm sure you are.

35:17.543 --> 35:18.976
What is it?

35:19.045 --> 35:20.205
Your father.

35:22.348 --> 35:23.610
Uncle Willie!

35:26.419 --> 35:29.547
- Uncle Willie, how nice.
- I beg your pardon.

35:29.622 --> 35:32.853
Please go on into lunch, everyone.
I want a word with Uncle Willie.

35:32.925 --> 35:35.894
- Another place, Edward.
- Yes, madam.

35:41.701 --> 35:43.464
I'm afraid I don't understand.

35:43.536 --> 35:46.403
You never have, but you
came anyway, didn't you?

35:46.472 --> 35:51.068
Oh. Still Justice with her
shining sword, eh, daughter?

35:51.143 --> 35:54.112
- Who's on the spot?
- We are, thanks to you...

35:54.180 --> 35:55.613
Uncle Willie.

36:02.021 --> 36:03.784
How long will you be researching?

36:03.856 --> 36:07.155
Not long if I can find the right books...
his family history and stuff like that.

36:07.226 --> 36:09.421
There's a cousin Joanna
that's definitely crazy.

36:09.495 --> 36:10.792
- Who told you?
- Dinah.

36:10.863 --> 36:13.457
- Dinah should know.
- Come across the street when you finish.

36:13.532 --> 36:15.295
- Miss Hobson's establishment.
- Okay.

36:43.195 --> 36:44.628
What does thee wish?

36:44.697 --> 36:46.665
I'm looking for some local b...

36:49.235 --> 36:52.204
- What'd you say?
- What does thee wish?

36:54.006 --> 36:57.237
Um, local biography or history.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.074
If thee will, consult with
my colleague in there.

37:05.518 --> 37:07.611
Dost thou have a washroom?

37:09.555 --> 37:10.817
Thank thee.

37:31.811 --> 37:34.712
I know this is a public library,
but I wou...

37:34.780 --> 37:36.839
- Hello.
- Hello.

37:39.618 --> 37:41.950
Couldn't you afford
to buy my book?

37:42.021 --> 37:43.716
The bookstore didn't have one.

37:43.789 --> 37:45.916
Are you sure you're doing
the right thing?

37:45.991 --> 37:48.687
You know what happens to girls like you
when they read books like mine.

37:48.761 --> 37:51.161
They begin to think.
That's bad.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.357
These stories are beautiful.

37:53.432 --> 37:55.457
Why, Connor,
they're almost poetry.

37:56.635 --> 37:59.365
Don't kid yourself. They are.

37:59.438 --> 38:01.906
I can't make you out at all now.

38:01.974 --> 38:05.102
Really?
I thought I was easy.

38:05.177 --> 38:08.408
So did I, but you're not.

38:10.116 --> 38:13.643
You talk so big and tough,
and then you write like this.

38:14.754 --> 38:16.221
Which is which?

38:17.957 --> 38:19.652
Both, I guess.

38:21.627 --> 38:25.757
No, I believe you put the toughness on
to save your skin.

38:27.166 --> 38:29.100
You think so?

38:29.168 --> 38:31.102
I know a little about that.

38:31.971 --> 38:34.303
- Do you?
- Quite a lot.

38:38.344 --> 38:40.278
Let's get out of here.

38:47.853 --> 38:52.347
This book was just such
a complete surprise to me.

38:52.425 --> 38:55.258
L... let's walk, shall we?
Lt'll be much more fun.

38:55.327 --> 38:57.795
Take this. Tell Mr. Kittredge
we'll meet him at the pool.

38:57.863 --> 38:59.296
Yes, Miss Tracy.

39:02.568 --> 39:06.265
The story called, "With The Rich
and Mighty," I think I liked it best.

39:06.338 --> 39:09.239
I got it from
a Spanish peasant's proverb.

39:09.308 --> 39:11.936
"With the rich and mighty,
always a little patience."

39:12.011 --> 39:13.308
I like that.

39:16.515 --> 39:18.608
What's the matter?
A little too rough?

39:18.684 --> 39:20.117
A little...

39:20.186 --> 39:21.949
but I'm used to it.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.987
Tell me something, will you?

39:26.058 --> 39:30.085
When you can do a thing like that book,
how can you possibly do anything else?

39:30.162 --> 39:34.428
You may not believe this, but there
are people that must earn their living.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.832
Of course, but people
buy books, don't they?

39:36.902 --> 39:38.836
Not as long as there's
a library around.

39:40.172 --> 39:43.266
That book of mine represents
two solid years' work...

39:43.342 --> 39:47.039
and it netted Connor
something under $600.

39:47.112 --> 39:50.548
- But that shouldn't be.
- Unhappily it is.

39:50.616 --> 39:53.084
This is beautiful country around here.
What is it all, anyway?

39:53.152 --> 39:56.644
Part of our place.
What about your Miss Imbrie?

39:56.722 --> 39:58.883
Well, Miss Imbrie's
in somewhat the same fix.

39:58.958 --> 40:01.256
She's a born painter and might be
a very important one...

40:01.327 --> 40:05.058
but Miss Imbrie must eat, and she also
prefers a roof over her head...

40:05.130 --> 40:08.156
to being constantly out
in the rain and snow.

40:08.234 --> 40:09.667
Food and a roof.

40:12.304 --> 40:14.932
You've really got something here.

40:15.007 --> 40:16.634
- Where?
- All this.

40:17.877 --> 40:20.345
Oh. Come on.
The dressing rooms are over here.

40:22.748 --> 40:24.773
I think you'll find
everything you need.

40:27.686 --> 40:31.053
Use any old one, but I think you'll find
most of the junk in there.

40:31.123 --> 40:33.182
- Yell if you need anything.
- Okay.

40:50.609 --> 40:52.201
I have an idea.

40:53.612 --> 40:56.342
I have the most wonderful
little house in Uniondale.

40:57.249 --> 41:00.946
It's up on a hill with a view
that would knock you silly.

41:01.020 --> 41:03.113
I'm never there except
in the hunting season...

41:03.188 --> 41:06.351
and not much then,
and I'd be so happy to know...

41:06.425 --> 41:08.985
that it was of some real use
to someone.

41:12.031 --> 41:14.022
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.028
There's a brook and a small lake...

41:18.103 --> 41:19.866
no size, really...

41:19.939 --> 41:22.931
and a patch of woods,
and in any kind of weather...

41:23.008 --> 41:25.272
it's the most wonderful...

41:25.344 --> 41:29.337
Well, anyhow, I'm so delighted
that I can offer it to you.

41:30.482 --> 41:33.212
Well, it's terribly nice of you,
but, uh...

41:36.155 --> 41:37.315
Heck, that's Dexter.

41:38.857 --> 41:42.156
Look, if he comes here,
stand by, will you?

41:42.227 --> 41:44.718
- I don't want to be alone with him.
- Certainly, if you like.

41:44.797 --> 41:47.664
Isn't it lucky that I happened
to think about that house?

41:47.733 --> 41:50.725
And don't think I'd come trooping in
every minute, because I wouldn't.

41:50.803 --> 41:53.601
I'd never come
except when expressly asked to.

41:53.672 --> 41:57.369
- Well, it isn't that.
- What is it?

41:57.443 --> 41:59.377
Well, you see,
the idea of artists...

41:59.445 --> 42:03.438
depending upon a patron lady bountiful
has more or less gone out.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.810
Oh. I see.

42:09.421 --> 42:13.755
That wasn't especially kind
of you, Mr. Connor.

42:13.826 --> 42:16.226
I'm sorry to have seemed patronizing.

42:16.295 --> 42:18.456
- Now, look, I didn't mean...
- Please don't bother.

42:24.670 --> 42:27.764
- Hello.
- Hello. Fancy seeing you here.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.535
Orange juice? Certainly.

42:29.608 --> 42:32.736
Don't tell me you've forsaken
your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.

42:32.811 --> 42:35.006
No, I've just changed their color.

42:35.080 --> 42:38.572
I'm going for the pale pastel shades.
They're more becoming to me.

42:38.651 --> 42:40.642
How about you, Mr. Connor?
You drink, don't you?

42:40.719 --> 42:42.710
- Alcohol, I mean.
- A little.

42:42.788 --> 42:44.983
A little?
And you're a writer?

42:45.057 --> 42:48.549
Tsk, tsk, tsk. I thought all writers
drank to excess and beat their wives.

42:48.627 --> 42:52.188
You know, at one time I think
I secretly wanted to be a writer.

42:53.899 --> 42:57.027
Dexter, would you mind
doing something for me?

42:57.102 --> 42:59.093
- Anything. What?
- Get the heck out of here.

42:59.171 --> 43:00.638
I couldn't do that.

43:00.706 --> 43:02.674
That wouldn't be fair to you.
You need me too much.

43:02.741 --> 43:05.175
Would you tell me what
you're hanging around for?

43:05.244 --> 43:08.543
- No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.
- No, please don't go, Mr. Connor.

43:08.614 --> 43:10.980
As a writer, this ought to be
right up your street.

43:11.050 --> 43:12.517
Don't miss a word.

43:13.852 --> 43:17.219
I never saw you looking better, Red.
You're getting that fine, tawny look.

43:17.289 --> 43:21.020
Oh, we're going to talk
about me, are we? Goody.

43:21.093 --> 43:24.426
It's astonishing what money can do
for people, don't you agree, Mr. Connor?

43:24.496 --> 43:26.930
Not too much, you know.
Just more than enough.

43:28.767 --> 43:30.200
Take Tracy, for example.

43:30.269 --> 43:32.533
There was never a blow that
hasn't been softened for her.

43:32.604 --> 43:35.539
Never a blow that won't be softened.
It's even changed her shape.

43:35.607 --> 43:40.169
- She was once a dumpy little thing.
- I'm not interested in myself now.

43:40.245 --> 43:43.271
Not interested in yourself?
You're fascinated, Red.

43:43.348 --> 43:45.714
You're far and away
your favorite person in the world.

43:45.784 --> 43:47.775
- In case you don't know...
- Of course, Mr. Connor...

43:47.853 --> 43:49.912
she's a girl
who's generous to a fault.

43:49.988 --> 43:51.683
To a fault, Mr. Connor.

43:51.757 --> 43:53.884
Except to other people's faults.

43:53.959 --> 43:55.927
For instance, she never had
any understanding...

43:55.994 --> 43:57.552
of my deep and gorgeous thirst.

43:57.629 --> 43:59.961
- That was your problem.
- Granted.

44:00.032 --> 44:03.024
But you took on that problem
with me when you took me, Red.

44:03.102 --> 44:05.161
You were no helpmate there.
You were a scold.

44:05.237 --> 44:08.206
It was disgusting.
It made you so unattractive.

44:08.273 --> 44:11.470
A weakness, sure, and strength
is her religion, Mr. Connor.

44:11.543 --> 44:14.239
She finds human imperfection
unforgivable.

44:15.481 --> 44:17.745
When I discovered that
my relationship to her...

44:17.816 --> 44:21.081
was supposed to be not that of a loving
husband and a good companion but...

44:22.588 --> 44:24.579
- Oh, never mind.
- Say it.

44:25.491 --> 44:28.460
But that of a kind of high priest
to a virgin goddess.

44:29.795 --> 44:32.593
Then my drinks grew deeper
and more frequent.

44:33.799 --> 44:36.359
I never considered you as that
nor myself.

44:36.435 --> 44:38.494
You did it without knowing it.

44:38.570 --> 44:43.132
And the night that you got drunk on
champagne and climbed out on the roof...

44:43.208 --> 44:46.609
and stood there, naked,
with your arms out to the moon...

44:46.678 --> 44:48.168
wailing like a banshee.

44:49.748 --> 44:52.717
I never had the slightest recollection
of doing any such thing.

44:52.785 --> 44:55.549
You drew a blank.
You wanted to.

44:55.621 --> 44:57.612
Mr. Connor, what would you... oh.

44:59.057 --> 45:01.184
A nice story for Spy,
incidentally.

45:01.260 --> 45:03.524
Yes. Too bad we can't supply
photographs of you on the roof.

45:03.595 --> 45:06.120
Honestly, the fuss you made
over that silly, childish epis...

45:06.198 --> 45:09.292
It was enormously important
and most revealing.

45:09.368 --> 45:12.701
The moon is also a goddess,
chaste and virginal.

45:12.771 --> 45:15.331
Stop using those foul words.

45:15.407 --> 45:17.967
What are you trying
to make me out as?

45:18.043 --> 45:21.137
- What do you fancy yourself as?
- I don't know that I fancy myself...

45:21.213 --> 45:23.272
When I read you're gonna marry
Kittredge I couldn't believe it.

45:23.348 --> 45:25.612
That's why I'm here.
How could he even think of it?

45:25.684 --> 45:27.379
Because he's everything you're not.

45:27.452 --> 45:30.478
He's been poor, he's had to work,
and he's had to fight for everything...

45:30.556 --> 45:33.957
and I love him as I never
even began to love you.

45:34.026 --> 45:37.462
Maybe so, but I doubt it.
It's just a swing from me...

45:37.529 --> 45:39.463
but it's too violent a swing.

45:39.531 --> 45:41.624
Kittredge is no great
tower of strength.

45:41.700 --> 45:43.395
He's just a tower.

45:43.468 --> 45:45.026
You hardly know him.

45:45.103 --> 45:47.071
To hardly know him
is to know him well.

45:47.139 --> 45:50.575
Perhaps it offends my vanity to have
anyone who was even remotely my wife...

45:50.642 --> 45:52.303
remarry so obviously beneath her.

45:54.813 --> 45:58.146
How dare you, in this day and age,
use such an idiotic...

45:58.217 --> 46:01.380
I'm talking about the difference
in mind and spirit.

46:01.453 --> 46:04.217
You could marry Mac,
the night watchman. I'd cheer for you.

46:04.289 --> 46:07.019
- Kittredge is not for you.
- You bet he's for me.

46:07.092 --> 46:09.356
He's a great man and a good man.

46:09.428 --> 46:12.124
Already he's
of national importance.

46:12.197 --> 46:14.722
You sound like Spy magazine talking.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.496
But whatever he is, toots,
you'll have to stick.

46:17.569 --> 46:20.766
- He'll give you no out as I did.
- I won't require one.

46:24.042 --> 46:27.375
I suppose you'd still be attractive
to any man of spirit, though.

46:27.446 --> 46:30.438
There's something engaging about it,
this "goddess" business...

46:30.515 --> 46:34.007
something more challenging to the male
than the more obvious charms.

46:34.086 --> 46:36.145
- Really?
- Really.

46:36.221 --> 46:38.155
We're very vain, you know.

46:38.223 --> 46:41.681
"This citadel can and shall be taken,
and I'm the boy to do it."

46:43.095 --> 46:46.724
You seem quite contemptuous of me
all of a sudden.

46:47.900 --> 46:50.368
No, Red, not of you.

46:50.435 --> 46:51.732
Never of you.

46:55.274 --> 46:58.903
Red, you could be the finest woman
on this earth.

46:58.977 --> 47:02.538
I'm contemptuous of something inside you
you either can't help or won't try to.

47:02.614 --> 47:04.445
Your so-called "strength"...

47:04.516 --> 47:07.417
your prejudice against weakness,
your blank intolerance.

47:07.486 --> 47:09.977
- Is that all?
- That's the gist of it.

47:10.055 --> 47:13.991
Because you'll never be a first-class
human being or a first-class woman...

47:14.059 --> 47:16.425
until you've learned to have
regard for human frailty.

47:17.896 --> 47:20.831
It's a pity your own foot
can't slip a little sometime...

47:20.899 --> 47:23.231
but your sense of inner divinity
wouldn't allow that.

47:23.302 --> 47:26.430
This goddess must
and shall remain intact.

47:28.674 --> 47:30.767
There are more of you
than people realize.

47:30.842 --> 47:33.834
A special class of the American female.
"The Married Maidens."

47:33.912 --> 47:35.846
So help me,
if you say another word...

47:35.914 --> 47:38.144
I'm through, Red.
For the moment I've had my say.

47:39.017 --> 47:41.611
I suppose I should object
to this twosome.

47:41.687 --> 47:43.621
That would be most objectionable.

47:46.858 --> 47:48.792
Any time either of you
want my advice...

47:48.860 --> 47:51.192
- We'll give you a ring.
- Thanks. Do that, will you?

47:56.635 --> 47:58.603
So long, Red.

47:58.670 --> 48:03.004
I left you a wedding present. Sorry I
hadn't ribbon to tie it up with.

48:27.265 --> 48:28.960
Aren't you swimming?

48:29.034 --> 48:31.298
We haven't time.
Uncle Willie wants us at 8:00.

48:34.673 --> 48:37.301
Look what your friend
considers a wedding present.

48:39.411 --> 48:42.380
- Why, it's a model of the True Love.
- The what?

48:43.515 --> 48:46.484
A boat he designed
and built, practically.

48:46.551 --> 48:50.578
We sailed it down the coast of Maine
and back the summer we were married.

48:50.655 --> 48:52.020
My, she was yare!

48:52.090 --> 48:53.557
"Yare"? What's that mean?

48:53.625 --> 48:56.822
It means, uh...
Oh, what does it mean?

48:57.929 --> 49:00.921
Easy to handle, quick to the helm.
Fast, bright.

49:02.167 --> 49:04.135
Everything a boat should be...

49:04.202 --> 49:06.136
until she develops dry rot.

49:13.578 --> 49:16.877
Oh, George, to get away.

49:16.948 --> 49:19.212
Somehow to be useful
in the world.

49:19.284 --> 49:21.149
Useful? You, Tracy?

49:21.219 --> 49:24.245
I'm gonna build you an ivory tower
with my own two hands.

49:25.390 --> 49:27.017
Like fun you are.

49:27.092 --> 49:29.890
You mean you've
been in one too long?

49:29.961 --> 49:34.557
Well, I mean that
and a lot of things.

49:45.277 --> 49:47.677
You know, we're gonna
represent something, Tracy...

49:47.746 --> 49:50.180
you and I and our home.

49:50.248 --> 49:53.479
Something straight, sound and fine.

49:53.552 --> 49:56.919
Then perhaps Mr. Haven will be
somewhat less condescending.

50:03.895 --> 50:06.022
You don't really mind him, do you?

50:07.165 --> 50:09.133
I mean the fact of him?

50:09.201 --> 50:11.135
"Fact of him"?
What do you mean?

50:11.203 --> 50:13.262
I mean...
Well, you know.

50:13.338 --> 50:15.806
That he ever was
my lord and master.

50:15.874 --> 50:17.307
That we ever were...

50:17.375 --> 50:19.570
I don't believe
he ever was, Tracy.

50:19.644 --> 50:20.736
Not really.

50:20.812 --> 50:24.248
I don't believe that anyone ever was
or ever will be.

50:24.316 --> 50:27.046
That's the wonderful thing
about you, Tracy.

50:27.119 --> 50:28.484
What? How?

50:28.553 --> 50:32.956
You're like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, I guess.

50:33.024 --> 50:36.687
You're so cool and fine
and always so much your own.

50:36.761 --> 50:40.060
There's a kind of beautiful purity
about you, Tracy, like a statue.

50:40.132 --> 50:42.066
- George...
- It's grand, Tracy.

50:42.134 --> 50:44.364
It's what everybody
feels about you.

50:44.436 --> 50:46.631
It's what I first
worshipped you for from afar.

50:46.705 --> 50:49.640
- George, listen.
- First, now and always.

50:51.309 --> 50:53.641
Only from a little nearer now,
eh, darling?

50:53.712 --> 50:58.308
L... I don't want to be worshipped.
I want to be loved.

50:58.383 --> 51:01.477
Well, you're that too, Tracy.
You're that, all right.

51:01.553 --> 51:04.420
I mean really loved.

51:04.489 --> 51:07.322
But that goes
without saying, Tracy.

51:07.392 --> 51:11.624
No. No, now it's you
who doesn't see what I mean.

51:16.301 --> 51:18.735
I'd better get dressed.
I hate to be late.

51:26.036 --> 51:29.301
Oh, nothing. Run along.
I'll be dressed when you get back.

52:11.515 --> 52:13.949
You're Uncle Willie's guest of honor.
You mustn't be late.

52:14.018 --> 52:16.885
That fiancé of yours roared
out of here on two wheels.

52:16.954 --> 52:19.184
Does he, by any chance,
ever walk anywhere?

52:19.256 --> 52:21.315
When he likes, I expect.

52:21.392 --> 52:24.623
I have a feeling he'll take that ring
tomorrow and go through center with it.

52:24.695 --> 52:26.322
Seth, you idiot!

52:28.165 --> 52:30.258
Very amusing, I'm sure.

52:30.334 --> 52:33.497
Almost as amusing as the sight of you
with your arm around Mother.

52:35.639 --> 52:37.129
I find very unamusing...

52:37.208 --> 52:39.836
the stupid, undignified spectacle
we're making of ourselves...

52:39.910 --> 52:42.310
for the benefit
of those two newspaper people.

52:42.379 --> 52:43.846
Whose fault is it?

52:43.914 --> 52:47.247
That's not the point. They can publish
anything they like about me...

52:47.318 --> 52:49.878
but I insist that we inform Connor
and the camera lady...

52:49.954 --> 52:52.354
that we're all aware
of their purpose here.

52:52.423 --> 52:54.687
All right.
I'll tell them myself.

52:55.926 --> 53:00.329
It'd look better coming from me
as the titular head of the family.

53:00.397 --> 53:03.059
Of course, inasmuch as you've
let us in for it in the first place!

53:03.133 --> 53:05.897
Keep that note out of your voice.
It's very unattractive.

53:05.970 --> 53:10.498
Oh? How does your dancer friend talk,
or does she purr?

53:10.574 --> 53:12.166
- Tracy!
- It's quite all right.

53:12.243 --> 53:15.440
Sweet and low, I suppose.
Dulcet. Very ladylike.

53:15.512 --> 53:18.447
You've got nerve to come back here in
your best head-of-the-family manner...

53:18.515 --> 53:22.349
and make stands and strike attitudes
and criticize my fiancé...

53:22.419 --> 53:24.478
and give orders
and mess things up generally.

53:24.555 --> 53:26.853
- Stop it instantly!
- I can't help it! It's sickening!

53:26.924 --> 53:30.690
- As if he'd done nothing at all.
- Which happens to be the truth.

53:30.761 --> 53:33.696
Anyway, it's not your affair.
If it concerns anyone...

53:35.299 --> 53:37.893
Well, actually, I don't know
who it concerns except your father.

53:39.470 --> 53:42.030
That's very wise of you, Margaret.

53:42.106 --> 53:45.269
What most wives fail to realize is that
their husbands' philandering...

53:45.342 --> 53:47.606
has nothing whatever
to do with them.

53:47.678 --> 53:50.841
Oh? Then what has it to do with?

53:51.815 --> 53:54.943
A reluctance to grow old, I think.

53:55.019 --> 53:58.250
I suppose the best mainstay a man
can have as he gets along in years...

53:58.322 --> 54:00.313
is a daughter.

54:00.391 --> 54:02.325
The right kind of daughter.

54:02.393 --> 54:03.985
How sweet.

54:04.061 --> 54:06.928
No, I'm talking seriously about
something I've thought over thoroughly.

54:06.997 --> 54:08.294
I've had to.

54:08.365 --> 54:10.526
A devoted young girl
gives a man the illusion...

54:10.601 --> 54:12.569
that youth is still his.

54:12.636 --> 54:15.434
- Very important, I suppose.
- Oh, very, very.

54:15.506 --> 54:18.964
Because, without her, he might be
inclined to go in search of his youth.

54:19.043 --> 54:22.672
That's just as important to him
as it is to any woman.

54:22.746 --> 54:25.613
But with a girl of his own,
full of warmth for him...

54:25.683 --> 54:28.379
full of foolish, unquestioning,
uncritical affection...

54:28.452 --> 54:31.114
- None of which I've got.
- None.

54:31.188 --> 54:33.554
You have a good mind,
a pretty face...

54:33.624 --> 54:35.888
a disciplined body that does
what you tell it.

54:35.959 --> 54:39.918
You have everything it takes to make
a lovely woman except the one essential.

54:39.997 --> 54:42.488
An understanding heart.

54:42.566 --> 54:45.296
Without that, you might as well
be made of bronze.

54:48.339 --> 54:51.672
That's an awful thing
to say to anyone.

54:52.810 --> 54:54.778
Yes, it is indeed.

54:57.181 --> 55:00.378
So I'm to blame
for Tina Mara, am I?

55:00.451 --> 55:03.318
- To a certain extent, I expect you are.
- You coward!

55:04.888 --> 55:08.654
But better that than a prig
or a perennial spinster...

55:08.726 --> 55:10.523
however many marriages.

55:10.594 --> 55:12.789
- Seth, that's too much.
- I'm afraid it's not enough.

55:12.863 --> 55:14.660
I'm afraid nothing is.

55:14.732 --> 55:18.896
- What did you say I was?
- Do you want me to repeat it?

55:21.805 --> 55:23.739
A prig and a...

55:25.476 --> 55:28.934
You mean you think I think I'm some kind
of a goddess or something?

55:29.012 --> 55:32.209
If your ego
wants it that way, yes.

55:32.282 --> 55:34.944
Also, you've been talking
like a jealous woman.

55:40.023 --> 55:43.049
What's the matter with everyone
all at once, anyhow?

55:44.294 --> 55:47.661
I've been asleep.
What time is it?

55:47.731 --> 55:49.892
- After 7:00.
- Call my house.

55:49.967 --> 55:52.060
Tell them I'm on my way.
You'd better come along too.

55:52.136 --> 55:55.162
You're the host tonight,
you know? Uncle Willie.

55:55.239 --> 55:57.901
That's all over.
You're yourself again. So am I.

55:57.975 --> 56:00.603
- You've told them?
- I shall at the first opportunity.

56:02.513 --> 56:04.777
My first party, and about time.

56:04.848 --> 56:06.782
- Can I have a cocktail?
- Certainly not!

56:06.850 --> 56:10.251
- It's a dirty gyp.
- That dress hikes up a little behind.

56:10.320 --> 56:13.016
- No, it's me that does.
- You look adorable, Dinah.

56:13.090 --> 56:15.354
Oh, thanks, Tracy.
Thanks ever so much.

56:15.426 --> 56:17.155
Tracy, you must dress.

56:17.227 --> 56:20.287
Let's all have a last drink.
I'm sorry. I forgot. You never drink.

56:20.364 --> 56:22.161
- Prigs don't.
- What's that?

56:22.232 --> 56:24.564
- Nor spinsters.
- Again, please?

56:24.635 --> 56:26.728
Nor goddesses of any variety.

56:27.871 --> 56:30.897
Not completely.
Just a borderline case.

56:30.974 --> 56:33.442
Miss Imbrie and I
have something on our minds.

56:33.510 --> 56:35.671
Splendid.
Just the place for it. What?

56:35.746 --> 56:39.773
- We'd like to say something.
- I'm all ears and eyes.

56:41.685 --> 56:44.245
You're a vision of loveliness,
Miss Imbrie.

56:44.321 --> 56:46.255
Will you have a cocktail
or champagne?

56:46.323 --> 56:48.757
Oh, champagne.
I've never had enough.

56:48.826 --> 56:50.453
You will, tonight.

56:54.164 --> 56:56.598
- I'd like to say...
- I have something to say first.

56:56.667 --> 57:00.159
- I am Seth Lord.
- No!

57:00.237 --> 57:03.638
- Then that makes you...
- Available.

57:03.707 --> 57:05.732
And you are Miss Imbrie
of Spy magazine.

57:06.877 --> 57:08.936
- Now you know.
- I was going to tell you...

57:09.012 --> 57:12.504
- As to the reasons...
- Not now. We ought to be early.

57:12.583 --> 57:16.019
And who'll go with me
in my little car?

57:16.086 --> 57:20.182
Dinah and I. Seth, will you take
Miss Imbrie and Mr. O'Connor? Dinah?

57:21.358 --> 57:24.987
I can tell there's something in the air,
because I'm being taken away.

57:27.498 --> 57:29.989
Well, I'll see you all later.

57:31.068 --> 57:33.593
Don't do that.
What's the matter?

57:33.670 --> 57:35.069
Nothing.

57:35.138 --> 57:36.571
Miss Imbrie?

57:38.609 --> 57:41.942
You know, I felt exactly
as though I'd been pinched.

57:42.012 --> 57:43.946
Don't you think you weren't.

57:50.454 --> 57:52.046
You aren't even dressed.

57:52.122 --> 57:54.522
Um, you go ahead.

57:54.591 --> 57:57.924
I'll, uh,
follow along with George.

57:57.995 --> 57:59.929
What's the matter with Tracy?

58:00.797 --> 58:02.731
You tell me, will you?

58:02.799 --> 58:06.064
Darned if I know.
I'd like to.

58:06.136 --> 58:10.334
Well, Macaulay,
if you ever happen to find out...

58:10.407 --> 58:12.773
I'll tell you. Sure.

58:12.843 --> 58:15.403
And remember, Mike:

58:15.479 --> 58:18.642
- "With the rich and mighty"...
- "Always a little patience"?

59:13.303 --> 59:15.771
Do you know what time it is?

59:15.839 --> 59:17.704
It's after 4:00.

59:17.774 --> 59:20.766
In China it's later than that.

59:20.844 --> 59:23.312
In China we'd be married by now.

59:25.082 --> 59:27.482
Or perhaps it's only yesterday.

59:27.551 --> 59:29.485
I'm going home after this dance.

59:29.553 --> 59:31.544
There was a Chinese poet
who was drowned...

59:31.622 --> 59:34.420
while trying to kiss
the moon in the river.

59:34.491 --> 59:37.358
- He was drunk.
- I'd say as much.

59:37.427 --> 59:39.088
But he wrote beautiful poetry.

59:54.645 --> 59:58.046
Macaulay Connor of South Bend
reporting for duty.

59:58.115 --> 01:00:00.208
I'm sorry, we're going home
after this dance.

01:00:00.283 --> 01:00:03.309
You can't do that to me,
not a friend of old Junius.

01:00:03.387 --> 01:00:07.084
- I mean, not an old friend of Junius.
- I wish old Junius were here.

01:00:07.157 --> 01:00:09.125
Tracy, I'll get your wraps.

01:00:09.192 --> 01:00:10.853
He'll wrap me up.

01:00:10.927 --> 01:00:12.360
- Hello, you.
- Hello.

01:00:12.429 --> 01:00:14.795
- You look fine.
- I feel fine.

01:00:14.865 --> 01:00:16.560
Good, good.

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:20.863
Oh, wait a minute.
What was I saying?

01:00:20.937 --> 01:00:23.906
Oh. Let's have another drink,
or would Kittredge spank?

01:00:23.974 --> 01:00:27.501
- That's not what you were saying.
- It isn't? All right.

01:00:27.577 --> 01:00:29.807
Not what I was saying.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.541
Oh, oh, I know.

01:00:31.615 --> 01:00:35.107
Why do you wish your brother was here?
Does he like Kittredge?

01:00:35.185 --> 01:00:38.348
- Everybody likes Kittredge.
- Everybody likes Kittredge.

01:00:38.422 --> 01:00:41.914
Everybody except
C.K. Dexter Haven, huh?

01:00:44.161 --> 01:00:47.289
- Come on. We'll have some wine.
- Some wine.

01:00:50.133 --> 01:00:53.534
Mother, I thought you'd
gone home ages ago.

01:00:53.603 --> 01:00:56.367
I should have, but I've been
having such a good time.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.001
- Everybody should have a good time.
- Darling, what's come over you?

01:01:00.077 --> 01:01:02.671
Oh, it's just that
a lot of things...

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:05.544
I always thought were
terribly important...

01:01:05.615 --> 01:01:10.018
I find now are...
and the other way around and...

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:12.453
Oh, what the dickens.

01:01:12.522 --> 01:01:15.320
Connor, you're thirsty,
and the night is young.

01:01:16.493 --> 01:01:19.053
- Here we are, dear.
- We're going to have one more drink...

01:01:19.129 --> 01:01:22.462
- Not you, I'm afraid.
- Why should you be afraid?

01:01:22.532 --> 01:01:25.262
- You know wine never affects me.
- Look here...

01:01:25.335 --> 01:01:28.862
What she really wants, George,
is another dance with you.

01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:31.908
- Oh, very well.
- If it's that much of a chore...

01:01:31.975 --> 01:01:34.637
- Not for me!
- You've already been too attentive!

01:01:34.711 --> 01:01:36.542
George, please.

01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:38.740
What will the neighbors think?

01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:45.381
- The course of true love.
- Gathers no moss.

01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:56.565
Boy, champagne.

01:01:58.068 --> 01:02:01.367
Just the bottle.
I'm going on a picnic.

01:02:04.741 --> 01:02:08.108
- You're leaving us, Jock?
- Rather, but I'll be back.

01:02:08.178 --> 01:02:10.373
Come on, darling, champagne!

01:02:10.447 --> 01:02:12.506
And again and again and again!

01:02:19.923 --> 01:02:21.720
Follow that cab!

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:23.953
- What cab, sir?
- No cab.

01:02:24.027 --> 01:02:28.088
Some joke, huh? Take me to
the C.K. Dexter Haven mansion.

01:02:28.165 --> 01:02:30.759
- Mr. Haven?
- Front entrance.

01:02:36.973 --> 01:02:38.838
C.K. Dexter Haven!

01:02:43.613 --> 01:02:45.547
This is where
Cinderella gets off.

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:49.949
You hurry back to the ball before you
turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.181
Good-bye.
C.K. Dexter Haven.

01:02:56.259 --> 01:02:58.887
- What's up?
- You are.

01:02:58.962 --> 01:03:00.896
I hope it's worth it.
Come on in.

01:03:00.964 --> 01:03:03.125
I bring you greetings.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.533
Cinderella's slipper.
It's called champagne.

01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:09.766
Champagne is a great "levelerer."
Leveler.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.071
- It makes you my equal.
- I wouldn't quite say that.

01:03:13.143 --> 01:03:15.543
Well, almost my equal.

01:03:15.612 --> 01:03:18.547
C.K. Dexter Haven,
I would like to talk to you.

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:20.981
Let's go in the talking room.

01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:28.346
- Don't tell me the party's over so soon.
- No, no.

01:03:28.425 --> 01:03:31.792
- I just felt like talking to you.
- Well, that's nice.

01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:43.302
I wonder if I might
borrow a drink.

01:03:43.373 --> 01:03:45.898
Certainly.
Coals to Newcastle.

01:03:45.976 --> 01:03:47.910
Here, sit down.

01:03:59.623 --> 01:04:00.817
Excuse me.

01:04:13.169 --> 01:04:14.693
What's this?

01:04:16.206 --> 01:04:17.867
- Is it my book?
- Yes.

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:20.842
C.K. Dexter Haven,
you have unsuspected depth.

01:04:20.911 --> 01:04:23.971
- Thanks, old chap.
- But have you read it?

01:04:24.047 --> 01:04:26.709
I was trying to stop drinking.
I read anything.

01:04:26.783 --> 01:04:30.480
- And did you stop drinking?
- Yes. Your book didn't do it, though.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.317
Are you still in love with her?

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:39.829
Or perhaps you'd consider that
a very personal question.

01:04:39.896 --> 01:04:42.626
- Not at all.
- Liz thinks you are!

01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:44.064
Liz thinks you are.

01:04:44.134 --> 01:04:47.831
But of course, women like to romanti...
romanticize about things.

01:04:47.904 --> 01:04:51.203
- Yes, they do, don't they?
- Yes, they do, don't they?

01:04:51.274 --> 01:04:54.471
I can't understand how you
could've been married to her...

01:04:54.544 --> 01:04:56.478
and still know
so little about her.

01:04:56.546 --> 01:04:58.480
- Can't you?
- No, I can't you.

01:05:00.517 --> 01:05:03.975
I have the hiccups. I wonder
if I might have another drink?

01:05:04.054 --> 01:05:05.988
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

01:05:13.129 --> 01:05:15.495
You know, Tracy's
no ordinary woman...

01:05:15.565 --> 01:05:18.500
and you said some things to her
this afternoon I resented.

01:05:18.568 --> 01:05:21.401
- I apologize, Mr. Connor.
- That's quite all right.

01:05:21.471 --> 01:05:25.840
But when a girl is like Tracy,
she's one in a million. She's...

01:05:25.909 --> 01:05:28.605
She's sort of like a...
She's sort of like a...

01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:30.543
- A goddess?
- No, no, no!

01:05:30.613 --> 01:05:33.912
You said that word
this afternoon. No.

01:05:36.252 --> 01:05:38.550
She's sort of like a queen...

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.453
a radiant, glorious queen...

01:05:44.794 --> 01:05:47.262
and you can't treat her
like other women.

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:51.664
No, I suppose not. But then, I imagine
Kittredge appreciates all that.

01:05:51.735 --> 01:05:54.670
Kittredge!
Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!

01:05:54.738 --> 01:05:58.003
Ah, that fake "man of the people."
He isn't even smart.

01:05:58.074 --> 01:06:00.907
He's a five-cent edition
of Sidney Kidd.

01:06:02.312 --> 01:06:05.839
Well, I always thought Kidd himself
was the five-cent kid.

01:06:05.915 --> 01:06:09.316
And what's that make you worth,
C.K. Dexter Haven...

01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.411
bringing us down here?

01:06:11.488 --> 01:06:15.549
But you know why I did that.
To get even with my ex-bride.

01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:17.923
Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven...

01:06:17.994 --> 01:06:21.191
either I'm gonna sock you
or you're gonna sock me!

01:06:21.264 --> 01:06:23.255
Shall we toss a coin?

01:06:25.235 --> 01:06:28.762
Kidd's just using you
like he uses everybody else.

01:06:30.573 --> 01:06:33.371
You don't know Kidd
like I know him.

01:06:33.443 --> 01:06:38.437
The guy's colossal. He's terrific.
He's got everybody fooled.

01:06:38.515 --> 01:06:40.881
Yes.

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:45.410
"No mean Machiavelli
is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.

01:06:45.488 --> 01:06:48.548
"The world's his oyster
with an 'R' in every month."

01:06:49.626 --> 01:06:51.594
That's not bad.
When did I say that?

01:06:51.661 --> 01:06:53.219
You didn't. I did.
Sorry.

01:06:53.296 --> 01:06:56.265
I suppose you never heard about
Kidd's arrangement in Kansas City?

01:06:56.332 --> 01:06:57.822
- No.
- In San Francisco?

01:06:57.901 --> 01:07:00.267
Let me tell you about
the time he went to Boston...

01:07:00.336 --> 01:07:03.669
to be awarded the Sarah Langley
Medal for World Peace.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.903
The true story on that
little jaunt would ruin him.

01:07:11.514 --> 01:07:14.711
Look, Connor. What would happen
to you if I used this stuff?

01:07:14.784 --> 01:07:17.412
- Why?
- I might want to, very much.

01:07:17.487 --> 01:07:20.285
Kidd is holding a dirty piece
on Tracy's father.

01:07:20.356 --> 01:07:22.916
- This might stop him.
- On Tracy's father?

01:07:22.992 --> 01:07:24.983
That's right.

01:07:27.197 --> 01:07:29.495
Oh, so that's how
Kidd got you to...

01:07:29.566 --> 01:07:32.694
That's how Liz and I were gotten in.
Blackmail, huh?

01:07:32.769 --> 01:07:35.294
We all rode into this thing
on a filthy blackmail.

01:07:35.371 --> 01:07:38.465
Look, you use it.
Use it with my blessings.

01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:41.999
I'm through anyway. I'm not gonna
hand in a story on this wedding.

01:07:42.078 --> 01:07:45.514
- I'm gonna write one on Kidd.
- No, let me do it.

01:07:45.582 --> 01:07:47.846
I don't have to tell him
where I got my facts. Okay?

01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:50.613
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

01:07:53.189 --> 01:07:55.316
Now shoot.

01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:57.325
Peace medal. Boston.

01:07:57.393 --> 01:08:00.556
Oh, oh.
The time: May, 1938.

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:03.690
The place:
Boston, in a hotel.

01:08:03.766 --> 01:08:05.495
Kidd had just arrived.

01:08:05.568 --> 01:08:08.935
And this same Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen of America...

01:08:09.005 --> 01:08:12.771
this protector of American democracy
and homes and firesides...

01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:15.174
was at that very moment
entertaining...

01:08:15.245 --> 01:08:18.305
the South Carolina Mata Hari
on his yacht.

01:08:18.381 --> 01:08:20.474
Don't interrupt me!

01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:23.144
This Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:08:23.219 --> 01:08:25.881
who demanded the respect...

01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:28.389
of all who were
connected with him...

01:08:28.457 --> 01:08:31.291
- We've come for the body of Macaulay.
- I'm glad you came.

01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:34.694
- Can you use a typewriter?
- No, thanks. I have one at home.

01:08:36.765 --> 01:08:37.698
Who's that?

01:08:37.767 --> 01:08:41.032
Here was Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:08:41.104 --> 01:08:43.698
Sidney Kidd the good,
Sidney Kidd the noble...

01:08:43.773 --> 01:08:45.536
Where's Kittredge?

01:08:45.608 --> 01:08:47.200
- The people's choice?
- Yeah.

01:08:47.277 --> 01:08:50.769
His bride just dropped him at
the gatehouse after a slight explosion.

01:08:50.846 --> 01:08:52.109
A fight?

01:08:52.182 --> 01:08:54.582
Fifteen rounds, no decision.

01:08:54.651 --> 01:08:56.983
Where's my wandering parakeet?

01:09:15.337 --> 01:09:17.272
You look beautiful, Red.

01:09:22.145 --> 01:09:23.737
Come on in.

01:09:25.782 --> 01:09:27.716
Why?

01:09:27.783 --> 01:09:30.274
No particular reason.
A drink, maybe?

01:09:32.388 --> 01:09:34.356
I don't drink.

01:09:34.424 --> 01:09:36.585
That's right. I forgot.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:40.554
I haven't.

01:09:45.635 --> 01:09:48.160
Show Liz to a typewriter
and stand back.

01:09:48.238 --> 01:09:50.365
- Can she do it?
- She can and she will.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:53.432
- Dictate to her and then bring her home.
- Aren't you coming, Liz?

01:09:53.509 --> 01:09:55.943
It seems I've got to
commit suicide first.

01:09:56.012 --> 01:09:58.207
- Going my way, Miss?
- Miss Goddess to you.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.476
Okay, Miss Goddess to me.

01:10:37.186 --> 01:10:40.986
Champagne's funny stuff.
I'm used to whiskey.

01:10:41.057 --> 01:10:44.515
Whiskey's a slap on the back,
and champagne's...

01:10:44.594 --> 01:10:47.222
heavy mist before my eyes.

01:10:49.532 --> 01:10:51.898
Do you hear a telephone ringing?

01:10:51.968 --> 01:10:54.459
I did a little while ago.
Let's see.

01:10:56.906 --> 01:10:58.498
No, not yet.

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:03.770
Now I do, far away.

01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:09.311
It's my bedroom telephone.

01:11:11.254 --> 01:11:13.950
It couldn't be anyone but George.

01:11:14.023 --> 01:11:16.583
I was sort of swinish to him.

01:11:16.659 --> 01:11:19.423
Perhaps I'd better go
and see what...

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:28.637
It isn't ringing anymore.

01:11:30.406 --> 01:11:32.033
I tell you what.

01:11:32.108 --> 01:11:34.474
Let's have a quick swim
to brighten us up.

01:11:34.544 --> 01:11:36.535
Dexter and I always
swam after parties.

01:11:36.612 --> 01:11:38.978
Let's dip into this instead, huh?

01:11:43.286 --> 01:11:46.050
- Hello, you.
- Hello.

01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:48.556
- You look fine.
- I feel fine.

01:11:49.559 --> 01:11:51.493
Did you enjoy the party?

01:11:51.561 --> 01:11:54.029
Sure. Sure.

01:11:54.097 --> 01:11:56.964
The prettiest sight
in this fine, pretty world...

01:11:57.033 --> 01:12:00.935
is the privileged class
enjoying its privileges.

01:12:01.003 --> 01:12:04.530
- You're a snob, Connor.
- No doubt. No doubt.

01:12:04.607 --> 01:12:06.700
"Awash with champagne...

01:12:06.776 --> 01:12:09.609
"was Will Q. Tracy's
pleasure dome...

01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:13.547
"on the nuptial eve
of Tracy Samantha... Tracy..."

01:12:18.621 --> 01:12:21.112
You can't marry that guy.

01:12:21.991 --> 01:12:25.483
George? I'm going to.

01:12:25.561 --> 01:12:27.358
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.524
I thought I'd be for it at first,
but you don't seem to match up.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.192
Then the fault's with me.

01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:34.566
Maybe so. But all the same,
you can't do it.

01:12:35.938 --> 01:12:38.634
Come around about noon tomorrow.

01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:40.642
I mean today.

01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:45.112
- Snob.
- What do you mean, "snob"?

01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:49.948
You're the worst kind there is,
an intellectual snob.

01:12:50.019 --> 01:12:53.147
You made up your mind
awfully young, it seems to me.

01:12:53.222 --> 01:12:55.452
Thirty's about time
to make up your mind.

01:12:55.525 --> 01:12:57.720
And I'm nothing of the sort.
Not Mr. Connor.

01:12:57.794 --> 01:13:01.787
The time to make up
your mind about people...

01:13:01.864 --> 01:13:03.456
is never.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.492
Yes, you are,
and a complete one.

01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:09.834
- You're quite a girl, aren't you?
- You think?

01:13:09.906 --> 01:13:12.932
- Yeah, I know.
- I don't think I'm exceptional.

01:13:13.009 --> 01:13:16.376
- You are, though.
- I know any number like me.

01:13:16.446 --> 01:13:18.710
You oughta get around more.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.411
What, in the upper class?

01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:25.886
No, no.
No, thank you.

01:13:25.955 --> 01:13:30.119
You're just a mass
of prejudices, aren't you?

01:13:30.193 --> 01:13:33.822
You're so much thought
and so little feeling, Professor.

01:13:33.896 --> 01:13:37.059
- I am, am I?
- Yes, you am, are you.

01:13:37.133 --> 01:13:40.830
Your intolerance infuriates me!

01:13:40.903 --> 01:13:44.168
I should think that, of all people,
a writer would need tolerance.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.175
That fact is you'll never,
you can't be...

01:13:47.243 --> 01:13:49.768
a first-rate writer
or a first-rate human being...

01:13:49.846 --> 01:13:53.839
until you've learned to have
some small regard for human fra...

01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:02.553
Aren't the geraniums
pretty, Professor?

01:14:04.494 --> 01:14:07.327
Is it not a handsome day...

01:14:07.396 --> 01:14:10.229
that begins, Professor?

01:14:10.299 --> 01:14:12.824
- Lay off that "Professor."
- Yes, Professor.

01:14:12.902 --> 01:14:15.564
You've got all the arrogance
of your class, all right.

01:14:15.638 --> 01:14:18.436
How... what have classes
to do with it?

01:14:18.508 --> 01:14:20.703
What do they matter
except for the people in them?

01:14:20.776 --> 01:14:25.008
George comes from the so-called lower
class; Dexter from the upper. Well?

01:14:25.081 --> 01:14:29.142
Mac, the night watchman, is a prince
among men; Uncle Willie is a pincher.

01:14:30.786 --> 01:14:33.846
Upper and lower, my eye.
I'll take the lower, thanks.

01:14:33.923 --> 01:14:35.652
If you can't get a drawing room.

01:14:35.725 --> 01:14:37.659
- What do you mean by that?
- My mistake.

01:14:37.727 --> 01:14:39.695
- You're insulting!
- I'm sorry.

01:14:39.762 --> 01:14:43.391
- Oh, don't apologize!
- Who's apologizing?

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.061
I never knew such a man.

01:14:46.135 --> 01:14:48.535
You wouldn't be likely to,
not from where you sit.

01:14:48.604 --> 01:14:50.765
Talk about arrogance.

01:14:51.841 --> 01:14:54.275
- Tracy.
- What do you want?

01:14:55.611 --> 01:14:57.670
You're wonderful.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:03.279
There's a magnificence
in you, Tracy.

01:15:06.088 --> 01:15:09.057
Now I'm getting self-conscious.

01:15:09.125 --> 01:15:11.320
It's funny, I...

01:15:16.165 --> 01:15:17.257
Yeah?

01:15:19.869 --> 01:15:23.032
I don't know.
Go up, I guess. It's late.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.303
A magnificence that comes out
of your eyes and your voice...

01:15:28.377 --> 01:15:31.312
in the way you stand there,
in the way you walk.

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.405
You're lit from within, Tracy.

01:15:33.482 --> 01:15:36.815
You've got fires
banked down in you...

01:15:36.886 --> 01:15:40.515
hearth fires and holocausts!

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.794
I don't seem to you
made of bronze?

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:51.529
No. You're made out
of flesh and blood.

01:15:51.601 --> 01:15:54.593
That's the blank,
unholy surprise of it.

01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:58.538
You're the golden girl, Tracy...

01:15:58.608 --> 01:16:02.203
full of life and warmth
and delight.

01:16:04.447 --> 01:16:07.883
What goes on?
You got tears in your eyes.

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:09.815
Shut up. Shut up.

01:16:09.885 --> 01:16:12.251
Oh, Mike, keep talking.
Keep talking.

01:16:12.321 --> 01:16:14.255
Talk, will you?

01:16:17.226 --> 01:16:19.786
No, no, I've...

01:16:19.862 --> 01:16:21.523
I've stopped.

01:16:23.099 --> 01:16:24.862
Why?

01:16:24.934 --> 01:16:29.428
Has your mind taken hold again,
dear Professor?

01:16:30.573 --> 01:16:34.009
Well, it's a good thing,
don't you agree?

01:16:34.076 --> 01:16:35.202
No, Professor.

01:16:35.277 --> 01:16:37.404
Lay off that "Professor" stuff!
Do you hear me?

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.243
Yes, Professor.

01:16:42.284 --> 01:16:44.718
- That's all I am to you?
- Of course, Professor.

01:16:44.787 --> 01:16:47.415
- Are you sure?
- Why, yes, of course...

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.793
Golly.

01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:00.601
- Golly Moses!
- Tracy.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:02.695
- Mr. Connor...
- Let me tell you something.

01:17:02.772 --> 01:17:05.536
- I've got the shakes.
- It can't be anything like love, can it?

01:17:05.608 --> 01:17:07.974
No, no, it mustn't be.
It can't.

01:17:08.044 --> 01:17:11.070
- Would it be inconvenient?
- Terribly.

01:17:11.147 --> 01:17:13.115
Anyway, I know it isn't.

01:17:13.182 --> 01:17:15.616
- Mike, we're out of our minds.
- Right into our hearts.

01:17:15.685 --> 01:17:18.210
- That ought to have music.
- It does, doesn't it?

01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:21.552
It's as if my insteps
were melting away.

01:17:21.624 --> 01:17:24.320
- Have I got feet of clay?
- Tracy.

01:17:24.393 --> 01:17:26.987
It's not far to the pool.
It's in the birch grove.

01:17:27.063 --> 01:17:29.361
- It'll be lovely now.
- Tracy, you're tremendous.

01:17:29.432 --> 01:17:31.423
Put me in your pocket, Mike.

01:17:46.582 --> 01:17:48.982
I can't imagine what
makes me so sleepy.

01:17:49.051 --> 01:17:52.452
- It couldn't be the company.
- It's you, Mr. Dexter.

01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:55.081
- Hello, Mac.
- I heard you were about.

01:17:55.157 --> 01:17:58.092
- Any prowlers around?
- No prowlers.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.789
- Can Miss Imbrie get in this way?
- If she can't, you can go in the back.

01:18:01.864 --> 01:18:03.297
Good.

01:18:06.702 --> 01:18:08.863
- Thanks, Mac. Good night.
- Good night, sir.

01:18:08.938 --> 01:18:13.238
Well, home after
a hard day's blackmailing.

01:18:14.677 --> 01:18:17.339
When are you going
to telephone Kidd?

01:18:17.413 --> 01:18:19.574
In time to get him here
for the wedding.

01:18:19.648 --> 01:18:21.081
Why?

01:18:21.984 --> 01:18:25.385
A sort of wedding present,
if it works.

01:18:26.522 --> 01:18:28.285
If it works.

01:18:29.258 --> 01:18:31.783
I could still tear it up.

01:18:31.861 --> 01:18:36.764
No. Mike's only chance to ever become
a really fine writer is to get fired.

01:18:37.633 --> 01:18:39.624
You're a good number, Liz.

01:18:39.702 --> 01:18:42.432
Oh, I just photograph well.

01:18:43.506 --> 01:18:46.066
I'm certainly out of focus now.

01:18:46.142 --> 01:18:48.235
Why don't you take a swim?

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:50.335
- A swim?
- Sure.

01:18:50.412 --> 01:18:53.506
Tracy and I always
took a swim after a party.

01:18:53.582 --> 01:18:55.675
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:55.751 --> 01:18:57.446
Bet it was fun.

01:18:58.721 --> 01:19:01.155
I'll have to try it
with Mike sometime.

01:19:02.358 --> 01:19:05.020
Liz, why don't you marry him?

01:19:06.028 --> 01:19:08.223
- You really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:09.165 --> 01:19:11.531
He's still got a lot to learn.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.194
I don't want to get
in his way for a while.

01:19:18.841 --> 01:19:20.775
It's risky though, Liz.

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:23.073
Suppose another girl
came along in the meantime?

01:19:23.145 --> 01:19:25.875
I'd scratch her eyes out,
I guess.

01:19:25.948 --> 01:19:29.384
That is, unless she was going to
marry somebody else the next day.

01:19:52.007 --> 01:19:54.441
- Hello, Kittredge.
- What are you doing here?

01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:56.774
I'm a friend of the family's.
Dropped in for a chat.

01:19:56.846 --> 01:19:59.406
Don't try to be funny.
I asked you a question.

01:19:59.481 --> 01:20:01.949
I could ask you
the same question.

01:20:02.017 --> 01:20:04.212
I telephoned Tracy,
and her phone didn't answer.

01:20:04.286 --> 01:20:06.516
I was worried,
so I walked over.

01:20:06.589 --> 01:20:09.581
- I was worried too.
- About what?

01:20:09.658 --> 01:20:13.185
What do you think of
this fellow Connor, or do you?

01:20:13.262 --> 01:20:14.854
If you're trying to insinuate...

01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:18.161
My dear chap, I wouldn't
insinuate anything, only...

01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:27.375
Kittredge,
I'd advise you to go to bed.

01:20:27.443 --> 01:20:29.775
I don't want your advice.
I'm staying right here.

01:20:29.845 --> 01:20:33.246
You're making a mistake.
Somehow I don't think you'll understand.

01:20:33.315 --> 01:20:37.081
- Maybe you'd better leave that to...
- Dreams really do come true

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.714
Someday I'll wish upon a star

01:20:40.789 --> 01:20:43.417
- What's that?
- It's Mac, the night watchman.

01:20:43.492 --> 01:20:45.551
Always singing.
I'll walk you around the house.

01:20:45.628 --> 01:20:48.722
Something's going on here,
and I'm staying.

01:20:48.797 --> 01:20:50.458
And so are you.

01:20:50.532 --> 01:20:53.262
All right, then.
Take the works.

01:20:53.335 --> 01:20:55.803
Only heaven help you.

01:20:55.871 --> 01:21:00.069
Somewhere over the rainbow

01:21:00.142 --> 01:21:02.508
Way up high

01:21:02.578 --> 01:21:05.570
There's a land
that I heard of

01:21:05.648 --> 01:21:08.446
Once in a lullaby

01:21:14.523 --> 01:21:17.754
And the dreams

01:21:17.826 --> 01:21:20.420
That I dare to dre...

01:21:20.496 --> 01:21:23.021
- Uh-oh.
- Don't stop, Mikey.

01:21:23.098 --> 01:21:24.690
Keep crooning.

01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:32.372
Someday over the rainbow

01:21:32.441 --> 01:21:34.671
Way up high

01:21:34.743 --> 01:21:37.678
- What is this, Connor?
- Easy, old man. She's not hurt?

01:21:37.746 --> 01:21:41.773
- No, no.
- Not wounded, sire, but dead.

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:45.149
Seems the minute she hit the water,
the wine hit her.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.518
- Look here, Connor.
- A likely story!

01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:50.717
- What'd you say?
- A likely story!

01:21:50.793 --> 01:21:52.727
- If you think that...
- You'll be down directly?

01:21:52.795 --> 01:21:54.592
- Yes, if you want!
- I want.

01:21:55.364 --> 01:21:56.991
Hello, Dexter.

01:21:57.066 --> 01:21:58.931
Hello, George.

01:21:59.902 --> 01:22:01.494
Hello, Mike.

01:22:10.012 --> 01:22:12.503
Second door to the right,
top of the stairs. Don't wake Dinah.

01:22:12.581 --> 01:22:14.981
My feet are made of clay.
Did you know?

01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:17.245
Good night, little man.

01:22:21.056 --> 01:22:23.490
How are the mighty fallen.

01:22:26.962 --> 01:22:29.226
If I know Tracy,
and I know her well...

01:22:29.298 --> 01:22:31.459
she'll remember little of this.

01:22:31.533 --> 01:22:34.400
For the second time in her life,
she'll draw quite a tidy blank.

01:22:38.273 --> 01:22:41.106
- You don't believe it, then?
- Believe what?

01:22:41.176 --> 01:22:44.839
Well, the implications of
what you saw, let us say.

01:22:44.913 --> 01:22:48.076
- What else am I to believe?
- That's entirely up to you.

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:51.381
I got eyes, I got imagination,
haven't I?

01:22:51.453 --> 01:22:53.444
I don't know.
Have you?

01:22:53.522 --> 01:22:56.286
Oh, so you pretend
not to believe it.

01:22:56.358 --> 01:22:58.292
Yes, I pretend not to.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.590
- Then you don't know women.
- That's possible.

01:23:00.662 --> 01:23:03.153
- And you're a fool.
- That's quite possible.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:07.359
- You won't be too hard on her?
- I'll make up my own mind what I'll be!

01:23:07.436 --> 01:23:09.199
We're all only human, you know.

01:23:09.271 --> 01:23:12.331
You! All of you with
your sophisticated ideas!

01:23:13.142 --> 01:23:14.803
Ain't it awful?

01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.111
Why, you low...

01:23:25.854 --> 01:23:27.287
What right have you...

01:23:27.356 --> 01:23:29.950
A husband's.
'Til tomorrow, Kittredge.

01:23:33.462 --> 01:23:35.396
Hey, fella.

01:23:36.598 --> 01:23:39.192
How do you feel?

01:23:39.268 --> 01:23:41.202
- If you think I...
- I know.

01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:43.966
I'm sorry. I thought I'd better
hit you before he did.

01:23:44.039 --> 01:23:47.031
He's in better shape than I am.

01:23:47.109 --> 01:23:48.974
Well, you'll do.

01:23:51.146 --> 01:23:54.172
Hello, Mr. Dexter.
Anything wrong?

01:23:54.249 --> 01:23:56.877
Not a thing, Mac.
Just as quiet as a church.

01:23:56.952 --> 01:23:58.886
Who is it?

01:24:02.324 --> 01:24:05.384
Doggone. I thought it
might've been Mr. Kittredge.

01:24:05.461 --> 01:24:07.361
We can't have everything, Mac.

01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:10.157
Good night.

01:24:34.857 --> 01:24:36.882
- Mr. Tracy...
- Good grief, man.

01:24:36.959 --> 01:24:39.689
Don't scream at me at the top
of your voice like that.

01:24:39.761 --> 01:24:41.820
Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.

01:24:41.897 --> 01:24:44.297
Miss Dinah waiting for me?
Where and why?

01:24:44.366 --> 01:24:46.698
Just outside the door, sir.
I don't know why.

01:24:46.768 --> 01:24:49.999
This is one of those days
which the pages of history teach us...

01:24:50.072 --> 01:24:52.563
are best spent lying in bed.

01:24:59.681 --> 01:25:01.342
Uncle Willie!

01:25:02.417 --> 01:25:04.476
Uncle Willie,
where are you going?

01:25:04.553 --> 01:25:06.487
Back to bed, unless you
give me your oath...

01:25:06.555 --> 01:25:08.489
you will speak in
a civilized tone of voice.

01:25:08.557 --> 01:25:11.890
I'll be quiet, Uncle Willie.
It's so important that I see you.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.589
Must we ride in that thing? Wouldn't we
be more comfortable on pogo sticks?

01:25:15.664 --> 01:25:18.861
I had to be alone with you,
and this is very intimate.

01:25:30.946 --> 01:25:33.312
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing much.

01:25:33.382 --> 01:25:35.316
My head just fell off, that's all.

01:25:37.085 --> 01:25:40.816
What is all this gibberish
about Mr. Connor?

01:25:40.889 --> 01:25:43.881
What makes you suspect what
and since when?

01:25:43.959 --> 01:25:47.326
Last night,
and well into the morning.

01:25:47.396 --> 01:25:49.887
Uncle Willie,
isn't my duty to tell George?

01:25:49.965 --> 01:25:51.728
He might want to marry her anyway.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:55.736
But she can't. If she marries anyone,
it's got to be Mr. Connor.

01:25:55.804 --> 01:25:58.932
Why, Dinah.
What makes you think she should?

01:25:59.007 --> 01:26:02.033
Apparently the little cherub
has heard or seen something.

01:26:03.111 --> 01:26:05.102
That's Dexter's own Dinah.

01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:08.513
You have a certain amount of cheek
walking in here on this of all mornings.

01:26:08.584 --> 01:26:10.950
- Do I?
- Yes.

01:26:11.019 --> 01:26:12.953
What's all this
about Mr. Connor, Dinah?

01:26:13.021 --> 01:26:15.319
Did the party last night
give you bad dreams?

01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:18.223
- It wasn't any dream.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

01:26:18.293 --> 01:26:20.625
It's hard to tell once you've
gone to sleep, isn't it?

01:26:20.696 --> 01:26:21.958
Is it?

01:26:23.699 --> 01:26:26.463
What-ho, the bride.

01:26:32.874 --> 01:26:34.136
Hello.

01:26:34.943 --> 01:26:38.435
Um, isn't it a fine day, though.

01:26:41.850 --> 01:26:43.112
Is everybody fine?

01:26:44.353 --> 01:26:45.752
That's fine.

01:26:47.556 --> 01:26:49.490
My, I'm hearty.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:53.594
How do you feel otherwise?

01:26:53.662 --> 01:26:55.653
I don't know what's the matter with me.

01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:57.699
I must have had
too much sun yesterday.

01:26:57.766 --> 01:27:00.394
- My eyes don't open properly.
- Really?

01:27:00.469 --> 01:27:03.996
Ugh! Please go home, Dext.

01:27:04.072 --> 01:27:06.097
Not until we've got
those eyes open.

01:27:06.174 --> 01:27:08.369
Uncle Willie. Good morning.

01:27:08.443 --> 01:27:10.172
That remains to be seen.

01:27:11.513 --> 01:27:13.708
Aren't you here early,
Uncle Willie?

01:27:13.782 --> 01:27:16.182
It's nearly half past twelve.

01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:18.219
It can't be.
Where's Mother?

01:27:18.287 --> 01:27:21.120
She's talking with the orchestra.
Father with the minister.

01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:24.989
And Mr. Connor,
he hasn't come down yet.

01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:28.262
And it's Saturday,
your wedding day, remember?

01:27:28.330 --> 01:27:31.322
Thanks loads.
It's nice to have things account...

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.334
Only I wonder
what this might be.

01:27:33.402 --> 01:27:35.427
- That looks like a wristwatch.
- But whose?

01:27:35.504 --> 01:27:37.699
I found it in my room.
I nearly stepped on it.

01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:46.609
Also, I think I was robbed at your house
last night, Uncle Willie.

01:27:46.682 --> 01:27:49.207
My bracelet and engagement rings
are missing...

01:27:49.284 --> 01:27:52.310
- Here you are.
- But you weren't at the party.

01:27:52.387 --> 01:27:53.877
- Wasn't I?
- Were you?

01:27:53.955 --> 01:27:56.651
Don't tell me you don't remember.

01:27:56.725 --> 01:28:00.126
I do, now, sort of.

01:28:00.195 --> 01:28:03.494
But there were such a lot of people.
I stayed so late.

01:28:03.565 --> 01:28:05.624
You should have taken a quick swim
when you got home.

01:28:05.701 --> 01:28:06.998
A swim?

01:28:07.736 --> 01:28:09.465
A swim!

01:28:09.538 --> 01:28:11.369
There! Now they're open.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:15.342
That was just the beginning,
and it was no dream.

01:28:17.679 --> 01:28:19.670
Do you suppose,
speaking of eye-openers...

01:28:19.748 --> 01:28:22.581
That's the first sane remark
I've heard today. Come along.

01:28:22.651 --> 01:28:26.246
I know a formula that can pop pennies
off the eyelids of dead Irishmen.

01:28:27.522 --> 01:28:29.683
Dinah, if the conversation
should lag...

01:28:29.758 --> 01:28:32.352
you might tell Tracy
about your dream.

01:28:32.427 --> 01:28:35.097
- What did he say?
- Oh, nothing.

01:28:35.097 --> 01:28:35.529
- What did he say?
- Oh, nothing.

01:28:35.597 --> 01:28:38.122
Tray, I hate you to get married
and go away.

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.499
I'll miss you, darling.
I'll miss all of you.

01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:45.597
You know, I did have the funniest
dream about you last night.

01:28:45.674 --> 01:28:47.835
Did you? Do you like
my dress, Dinah?

01:28:47.909 --> 01:28:50.878
- Yes, ever so much.
- Feels awfully heavy.

01:28:50.946 --> 01:28:53.346
It was all certainly
pretty rooty-tooty.

01:28:53.415 --> 01:28:55.940
- What was?
- My dream.

01:28:56.017 --> 01:28:59.180
I dreamed I got up
and went over to the window.

01:28:59.254 --> 01:29:02.189
Guess what I dreamed I saw coming over
out of the woods.

01:29:02.257 --> 01:29:05.283
I haven't the faintest idea.
A skunk?

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.921
Well, sort of.
It was Mr. Connor.

01:29:08.997 --> 01:29:10.430
Mr. Connor?

01:29:10.499 --> 01:29:15.596
Yes, with his arms full of something,
and guess what it turned out to be.

01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:18.935
- What?
- You, and some clothes.

01:29:19.007 --> 01:29:23.535
Wasn't it funny? It was sort of like
as if you were coming from the pool.

01:29:24.913 --> 01:29:26.904
The pool?

01:29:26.982 --> 01:29:30.509
I'm going crazy. I'm standing here,
solidly, on my own two hands...

01:29:30.585 --> 01:29:32.553
and going crazy.

01:29:32.621 --> 01:29:36.955
- Then what?
- After a while, I opened my door...

01:29:37.025 --> 01:29:39.550
and there he was in the hall,
still coming along with you...

01:29:39.628 --> 01:29:41.926
puffing like a steam engine.

01:29:41.997 --> 01:29:43.988
His wind can't be very good.

01:29:44.065 --> 01:29:45.293
Then what?

01:29:45.367 --> 01:29:48.666
- You were sort of crooning.
- I never crooned in my life.

01:29:48.737 --> 01:29:51.467
I'm only saying
what it sounded like.

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.973
And then he...

01:29:54.309 --> 01:29:55.901
Guess what.

01:29:55.977 --> 01:29:57.308
I couldn't possibly.

01:29:57.379 --> 01:30:00.610
He sailed right into your room
with you, and that scared me...

01:30:00.682 --> 01:30:02.809
so I got up
and went to your door...

01:30:02.884 --> 01:30:06.047
and peeked in
to make sure you were all right.

01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:07.952
And guess what.

01:30:09.057 --> 01:30:11.753
- What?
- You were. He was gone by then.

01:30:12.661 --> 01:30:15.061
Gone?

01:30:15.130 --> 01:30:18.293
Of course he was gone.
He was never there.

01:30:18.366 --> 01:30:19.663
I know, Tracy.

01:30:19.734 --> 01:30:23.226
- I should certainly hope you did.
- I'm certainly glad I do.

01:30:23.305 --> 01:30:27.799
Because if I didn't, and in a little
while I heard the minister say...

01:30:27.876 --> 01:30:31.403
"If anyone knows any just cause
or reason why these two...

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.313
"should not be united
in holy matrimony..."

01:30:34.382 --> 01:30:36.441
I just wouldn't know what to do.

01:30:36.518 --> 01:30:40.454
- Dexter says it's a dream too.
- You told Dexter all that?

01:30:40.522 --> 01:30:43.286
Not a word.
Not a single word.

01:30:43.358 --> 01:30:45.223
You know how quick he is.

01:30:45.293 --> 01:30:47.318
You little fiend.
How can you stand there...

01:30:47.395 --> 01:30:49.727
Dinah, your mother wants
to have a look at you.

01:30:49.798 --> 01:30:52.665
I look wonderful.
I smell good too.

01:30:52.734 --> 01:30:54.725
- Father?
- Yes, Tracy.

01:30:56.905 --> 01:30:59.897
I'm glad you came back.

01:31:01.076 --> 01:31:02.737
I'm glad you're here.

01:31:02.811 --> 01:31:04.073
Thank you, child.

01:31:05.347 --> 01:31:11.149
I'm sorry I'm... truly sorry
I'm a disappointment to you.

01:31:11.219 --> 01:31:13.278
I never said that, daughter.

01:31:14.756 --> 01:31:16.018
I never will.

01:31:23.598 --> 01:31:25.896
- Good morning.
- Oh. Hello.

01:31:28.904 --> 01:31:30.394
I'm testing the air.

01:31:30.472 --> 01:31:32.702
I like it,
but it doesn't like me.

01:31:33.441 --> 01:31:34.703
Hello, Dinah.

01:31:34.776 --> 01:31:37.074
How do you do?

01:31:37.145 --> 01:31:39.010
Did you have a good sleep?

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:41.071
Wonderful. Wonderful.
And you?

01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:44.277
Marvelous. Have you
ever seen a handsomer day?

01:31:44.352 --> 01:31:46.650
Never, never.
What'd it set you back?

01:31:46.721 --> 01:31:48.882
I got it for nothing
for being a good girl.

01:31:48.957 --> 01:31:50.390
Good. Good.

01:31:52.294 --> 01:31:54.558
Don't worry, I'm going.

01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:55.994
Why should you?

01:31:56.064 --> 01:31:59.227
I guess you must have things
you wish to discuss.

01:31:59.301 --> 01:32:02.293
Only remember, it's getting late.

01:32:05.607 --> 01:32:09.236
She's always trying
to make situations.

01:32:19.754 --> 01:32:22.416
- What's the matter with your chin?
- Chin?

01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:24.958
Oh. Does it show that much?

01:32:25.026 --> 01:32:26.459
A little. What happened?

01:32:26.528 --> 01:32:29.053
I guess I stuck it out too far.

01:32:29.130 --> 01:32:31.360
Into a door in the dark?

01:32:31.433 --> 01:32:35.233
Yes, that's it.
What about you? You all right?

01:32:35.303 --> 01:32:36.497
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:32:36.571 --> 01:32:39.096
Of course.
Why shouldn't I be?

01:32:39.174 --> 01:32:41.734
That was a flock of wine
we got away with.

01:32:41.810 --> 01:32:44.677
I guess we're lucky
both to have such good heads.

01:32:44.746 --> 01:32:47.715
Yeah, yeah, I guess that's it.

01:32:49.117 --> 01:32:52.177
Well, anyway, I...

01:32:52.253 --> 01:32:55.780
I had a simply wonderful evening.
I hope you enjoyed it too.

01:32:55.857 --> 01:32:57.791
I enjoyed the last part of it.

01:32:58.893 --> 01:33:00.724
Really?

01:33:00.795 --> 01:33:03.127
Why especially the last?

01:33:03.198 --> 01:33:05.189
Tracy, are you asking me?

01:33:06.801 --> 01:33:08.792
- Oh, you mean the swim.
- Yeah.

01:33:09.871 --> 01:33:11.304
We did swim...

01:33:13.108 --> 01:33:15.542
and so forth, didn't we?

01:33:16.678 --> 01:33:18.737
- Mike.
- Oh, Tracy, darling.

01:33:18.813 --> 01:33:20.974
- What can I say to you?
- Not anything.

01:33:21.049 --> 01:33:23.483
Don't say anything
and especially not "darling."

01:33:26.054 --> 01:33:28.454
- You're going through with it?
- Through with what?

01:33:28.523 --> 01:33:30.491
The wedding.

01:33:30.558 --> 01:33:32.321
Why shouldn't I?

01:33:33.695 --> 01:33:36.493
Well, I made a funny discovery.

01:33:36.564 --> 01:33:39.158
In spite of the fact that
somebody's up from the bottom...

01:33:39.234 --> 01:33:41.361
he can still be quite a heel...

01:33:41.436 --> 01:33:45.031
and even though somebody else
is born to the purple, he...

01:33:45.106 --> 01:33:47.574
he can still be
a very nice guy.

01:33:47.642 --> 01:33:51.100
I'm just repeating
what you said last night.

01:33:51.179 --> 01:33:54.842
I said a lot of things
last night, it seems.

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:56.975
Okay. No dice.

01:33:58.119 --> 01:34:00.747
Also no regrets
about last night, huh?

01:34:00.822 --> 01:34:02.517
Why should I have?

01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:04.683
Tracy, you're wonderful.

01:34:04.759 --> 01:34:09.696
I'm asking you. Tell me straight out.
Tell me the reason why I should have.

01:34:09.764 --> 01:34:11.698
No, don't.

01:34:11.766 --> 01:34:13.791
Just tell me, what time is it?

01:34:14.502 --> 01:34:15.935
What? Oh.

01:34:17.706 --> 01:34:19.833
What happened to my wristwatch?

01:34:19.908 --> 01:34:21.876
Why, is it broken?

01:34:21.943 --> 01:34:23.968
I must've lost it someplace.

01:34:24.045 --> 01:34:27.845
I can't tell you how extremely sorry
I am to hear that.

01:34:29.584 --> 01:34:31.677
There. On the table.

01:34:31.753 --> 01:34:35.450
I wonder who found it.
I'd offer a reward or something.

01:34:35.523 --> 01:34:38.651
I don't think that any reward
will be expected.

01:34:39.861 --> 01:34:42.694
Funny that it'd pop up here.

01:34:42.764 --> 01:34:46.393
Hey, what about an eye-opener?

01:34:46.468 --> 01:34:50.529
My eyes are opened.
Go and get one if you want to, though.

01:34:50.605 --> 01:34:52.573
Yeah, I think I will.
Excuse me.

01:34:53.508 --> 01:34:55.271
Yes, yes.

01:34:56.377 --> 01:34:58.368
Just give Mr. Kittredge a message.

01:34:58.446 --> 01:35:01.438
Tell him he'd better start
immediately. Thank you.

01:35:02.584 --> 01:35:04.984
- Are you one of the musicians?
- Uh, no.

01:35:05.053 --> 01:35:07.214
Of course,
you're Junius's friend.

01:35:07.288 --> 01:35:10.746
Only you're not. You don't have
any violin strings, do you?

01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:15.654
- Aspirin. Will that do?
- I don't think so.

01:35:15.730 --> 01:35:18.221
It's for a violin.
Oh, well, don't bother.

01:35:26.407 --> 01:35:29.706
- Hello, Connor. How are you?
- Just about as you'd think.

01:35:29.778 --> 01:35:31.040
You seen Kidd?

01:35:31.112 --> 01:35:33.046
I left a copy of it
at my house for him.

01:35:33.114 --> 01:35:35.742
- And?
- I'll tangle with him after the wedding.

01:35:35.817 --> 01:35:38.115
- Is that an alcoholic beverage?
- Yes. Why?

01:35:38.186 --> 01:35:40.279
- For me?
- No, for Tracy. You want one?

01:35:40.355 --> 01:35:43.984
I'd sell my grandmother for a drink.
You know how I love my grandmother.

01:35:44.058 --> 01:35:47.516
Uncle Willie's in the pantry
doing weird and wonderful things.

01:35:47.595 --> 01:35:49.859
Tell him I said
one of the same.

01:35:49.931 --> 01:35:51.558
Mind if I make it two?

01:35:51.633 --> 01:35:53.624
That's between you
and your grandmother.

01:36:10.752 --> 01:36:12.515
Doctor's orders, Red.

01:36:12.587 --> 01:36:14.020
What is it?

01:36:14.088 --> 01:36:16.989
Just the juice
of a few flowers.

01:36:17.058 --> 01:36:19.788
It's a type of stinger.
Removes the sting.

01:36:19.861 --> 01:36:23.627
- Oh, Dext, don't say that.
- Why not, Red?

01:36:23.698 --> 01:36:26.064
Nothing will.
Nothing ever can.

01:36:29.571 --> 01:36:32.062
I've done the most
terrible thing to you.

01:36:32.807 --> 01:36:34.399
To me?

01:36:34.475 --> 01:36:37.035
I doubt that very much, dear.

01:36:37.111 --> 01:36:39.045
You don't know.

01:36:39.113 --> 01:36:40.341
Maybe I shouldn't, huh?

01:36:40.415 --> 01:36:44.317
But you must. You've got to.
I couldn't stand it if you didn't.

01:36:44.385 --> 01:36:46.751
Dexter, what am I going to do?

01:36:46.821 --> 01:36:49.756
But why to me, darling?
Why ask me?

01:36:51.025 --> 01:36:53.789
Why do I come into it anymore?

01:36:53.862 --> 01:36:57.423
Aren't you confusing me with a fellow
named Kittredge or something?

01:36:57.498 --> 01:36:58.829
George!

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.996
George. Splendid chap, George.
Very high morals.

01:37:03.071 --> 01:37:04.595
Very broad shoulders.

01:37:04.672 --> 01:37:06.435
I've got to tell him.

01:37:06.507 --> 01:37:09.874
- Tell him what, darling?
- I've got to tell him.

01:37:10.945 --> 01:37:13.641
If you've got to tell him,
you've got to tell him.

01:37:13.715 --> 01:37:16.650
If he's got any brains, he'll have
realized what a fool he made of himself.

01:37:16.718 --> 01:37:19.653
Hello, George?
This is... yeah.

01:37:19.721 --> 01:37:21.848
I don't care whether
it's bad luck or not...

01:37:21.923 --> 01:37:24.619
but I've got to see you
before the wedding.

01:37:24.692 --> 01:37:27.354
What? No, I didn't get it.

01:37:27.428 --> 01:37:29.191
Right. Come on the run.

01:37:29.264 --> 01:37:31.289
- He sent a note over at ten.
- Good.

01:37:31.366 --> 01:37:33.300
I told you he'd come to his senses.

01:37:34.269 --> 01:37:37.067
- Was he here too?
- Sure.

01:37:37.138 --> 01:37:39.732
Good golly.
Why didn't you sell tickets?

01:37:53.354 --> 01:37:54.844
Say something, Dext.

01:37:56.357 --> 01:37:57.790
Say anything.

01:37:59.961 --> 01:38:03.158
- No, you do.
- Oh, Dext!

01:38:03.231 --> 01:38:05.859
I'm such an unholy mess of a girl.

01:38:07.368 --> 01:38:09.529
That's no good.
That's not even conversation.

01:38:11.372 --> 01:38:14.034
But never in my life...

01:38:14.108 --> 01:38:16.633
not if I live to be a hundred...

01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:20.477
will I ever forget how you tried
to stand me on my feet again today.

01:38:20.548 --> 01:38:22.539
Oh, you, you're in great shape.

01:38:25.186 --> 01:38:28.383
Tell me, what did you think
of my wedding present?

01:38:28.456 --> 01:38:30.788
I like my presents
at least acknowledged, you know.

01:38:30.858 --> 01:38:32.291
It was beautiful.

01:38:33.828 --> 01:38:35.819
And sweet, Dext.

01:38:35.897 --> 01:38:40.925
Yes. She was quite a boat,
the True Love, wasn't she?

01:38:41.002 --> 01:38:43.527
Was and is.

01:38:45.573 --> 01:38:47.131
My, she was yare!

01:38:48.309 --> 01:38:50.300
She was yare, all right.

01:38:52.613 --> 01:38:55.275
I wasn't, was I?

01:38:57.352 --> 01:38:58.614
Not very.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.647
You were good
at the bright work, though.

01:39:01.723 --> 01:39:03.315
I made her shine.

01:39:04.559 --> 01:39:06.584
Where is she now?

01:39:06.661 --> 01:39:08.686
I'm gonna sell her to Rufe Watriss.

01:39:09.831 --> 01:39:13.631
You're going to sell
the True Love for money?

01:39:13.701 --> 01:39:16.192
- Sure.
- To that fat old rum pot?

01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:18.431
Oh, well, what does it matter?

01:39:18.506 --> 01:39:20.497
When you're through with a boat,
you're through.

01:39:21.843 --> 01:39:24.175
Besides, it was only comfortable
for two people.

01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:27.013
Unless you want her.

01:39:28.516 --> 01:39:31.178
No. No, I don't want her.

01:39:34.088 --> 01:39:36.283
I'm designing another one anyway...

01:39:36.357 --> 01:39:38.348
along more practical lines.

01:39:39.127 --> 01:39:41.322
What will you call her?

01:39:41.396 --> 01:39:44.331
I thought the True Love II.
What do you think?

01:39:44.399 --> 01:39:48.460
If you call any boat that, I promise
I'll blow you and it out of the water.

01:39:48.536 --> 01:39:50.936
I'll tell you
what you can call her.

01:39:51.005 --> 01:39:54.600
- What?
- In fond remembrance of me...

01:39:54.675 --> 01:39:56.870
the Easy Virtue.

01:39:56.944 --> 01:40:00.141
Shut up, Red. I can't have you thinking
things like that about yourself.

01:40:00.214 --> 01:40:04.708
What am I supposed to think when I...
I don't know.

01:40:04.786 --> 01:40:06.720
I don't know anything anymore.

01:40:07.789 --> 01:40:10.155
That sounds very hopeful, Red.

01:40:10.224 --> 01:40:11.623
That sounds just fine.

01:40:14.195 --> 01:40:17.358
We're almost ready.
Stand up, dear.

01:40:17.432 --> 01:40:20.424
Turn around.
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

01:40:20.501 --> 01:40:23.527
I'm glad we decided against...
Dexter, you shouldn't be here...

01:40:23.604 --> 01:40:25.094
against the blue one.

01:40:25.173 --> 01:40:27.641
No games, Dexter.
George will be right over.

01:40:27.708 --> 01:40:30.700
I just telephoned. Here's a note
he sent you this morning.

01:40:30.778 --> 01:40:33.906
Oh, dear,
doesn't everything look lovely?

01:40:33.981 --> 01:40:35.710
Dr. Parsons?

01:40:37.118 --> 01:40:39.780
Mr. Kittredge hasn't arrived yet,
Dr. Parsons.

01:40:39.854 --> 01:40:42.084
Come along. I want you
to meet Tracy's grandmother.

01:40:42.156 --> 01:40:45.557
Tracy, don't sit down again
until after the ceremony.

01:40:45.626 --> 01:40:48.754
Dexter, they telephoned from your house
that a Mr. Sidney Kidd was there.

01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:52.231
I was to tell you that he's reading it.
Whatever does that mean?

01:40:54.368 --> 01:40:57.735
I have a feeling it won't be
so hard for me to resign now.

01:40:57.805 --> 01:41:00.103
And belts will be worn tighter
this winter.

01:41:01.676 --> 01:41:04.611
Well, Red, I'm afraid
it's the deadline.

01:41:05.847 --> 01:41:07.405
So is this. Listen.

01:41:07.482 --> 01:41:10.110
"My dear Tracy, I want you to know
that you will always be my friend...

01:41:10.184 --> 01:41:13.950
"but your conduct last night was so
shocking to my ideals of womanhood..."

01:41:14.021 --> 01:41:17.081
No, don't go.
You might as well hear it too.

01:41:17.158 --> 01:41:19.251
"To my ideals of womanhood
that my attitude toward you...

01:41:19.327 --> 01:41:21.625
"and the prospect of a happy
and useful life together...

01:41:21.696 --> 01:41:23.357
"has been changed materially.

01:41:24.499 --> 01:41:26.763
- "Your breach of common decency..."
- Tracy.

01:41:28.169 --> 01:41:30.103
Hello, George.

01:41:30.171 --> 01:41:32.264
Tracy, all these people.

01:41:35.143 --> 01:41:37.475
It's only a letter
from a friend.

01:41:37.545 --> 01:41:39.479
They're my friends too.

01:41:40.781 --> 01:41:42.908
"...certainly entitles me
to a full explanation...

01:41:42.984 --> 01:41:45.953
"before going through
with our proposed marriage.

01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:49.751
"In the light of day, I am sure
that you will agree with me.

01:41:49.824 --> 01:41:52.759
"Otherwise, with profound regrets
and all best wishes...

01:41:52.827 --> 01:41:54.317
"yours very sincere..."

01:41:55.863 --> 01:41:58.491
Yes, George,
I quite agree with you.

01:41:58.566 --> 01:42:01.296
In the light of day
and the dark of night...

01:42:01.369 --> 01:42:05.066
for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse...

01:42:05.139 --> 01:42:07.539
in sickness and in health and...

01:42:08.809 --> 01:42:12.677
Thank you so very much
for your good wishes at this time.

01:42:12.747 --> 01:42:15.944
- That's all you have to say?
- What else?

01:42:16.017 --> 01:42:18.850
I wish, for your sake
as well as mine...

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.354
I had an explanation, but...

01:42:21.422 --> 01:42:24.186
unfortunately, I have none.

01:42:24.258 --> 01:42:26.488
You'd better just say
good riddance, George.

01:42:26.561 --> 01:42:28.495
- It isn't easy.
- I don't see why.

01:42:29.964 --> 01:42:32.194
- Say something, stupid!
- Just wait a minute.

01:42:32.266 --> 01:42:33.563
What for?

01:42:33.634 --> 01:42:36.660
On the very eve of your wedding,
an affair with another man!

01:42:36.737 --> 01:42:39.968
I told you I agree, and I'll
tell you again, good riddance to me.

01:42:40.041 --> 01:42:43.101
Tracy, your attitude
is a little difficult to understand.

01:42:43.177 --> 01:42:45.668
- Yes, I can see that it would be.
- Not necessarily.

01:42:45.746 --> 01:42:49.409
- You keep out of this.
- You forget, I am out of it.

01:42:49.483 --> 01:42:52.543
Kittredge, it may
interest you to know...

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:55.316
that this so-called "affair"
consisted of exactly two kisses...

01:42:55.389 --> 01:42:56.981
and a late swim.

01:42:57.058 --> 01:42:58.889
- Thanks, but...
- Which I enjoyed...

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:01.758
and the memory of which
I wouldn't part with for anything.

01:43:01.829 --> 01:43:03.854
- It's no use, Mike.
- After which...

01:43:03.931 --> 01:43:07.389
I deposited Tracy on her bed
in her room...

01:43:07.468 --> 01:43:10.198
and returned down here to you two,
which doubtless you'll remember.

01:43:10.271 --> 01:43:12.262
Doubtless without a doubt.

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:15.036
You mean to say
that was all there was to it?

01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:16.440
I do.

01:43:18.112 --> 01:43:22.879
Why? Was I so unattractive,
so distant, so forbidding or something?

01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:25.646
- This is fine talk too.
- I'm asking a question.

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:28.848
You were extremely attractive,
and as for distant and forbidding...

01:43:28.923 --> 01:43:31.983
on the contrary, but you also
were a little the worse...

01:43:32.059 --> 01:43:35.722
or better... for wine,
and there are rules about that.

01:43:35.796 --> 01:43:38.959
Thank you, Mike.
I think men are wonderful.

01:43:39.033 --> 01:43:40.762
The little dears.

01:43:40.835 --> 01:43:43.702
I fail to see the humor
in this situation, Miss Imbrie.

01:43:43.771 --> 01:43:47.002
I can appreciate that.
It was hard for me too at first.

01:43:47.074 --> 01:43:49.099
- Oh, Liz.
- It's all right, Tracy.

01:43:49.176 --> 01:43:53.476
We all go haywire at times,
and if we don't, maybe we ought to.

01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:58.846
You see, it really wasn't Tracy
at all, Mr. Kittredge.

01:43:58.919 --> 01:44:03.083
It was another girl.
A Miss Pommery, 1926.

01:44:03.157 --> 01:44:06.149
You'd had too much to drink, Tracy.

01:44:06.227 --> 01:44:09.458
That seems to be
the consensus of opinion.

01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:12.829
Will you promise me
never to touch the stuff again?

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:16.700
No, George.
I don't believe I will.

01:44:16.771 --> 01:44:18.864
There are certain things
about that other girl...

01:44:18.939 --> 01:44:21.908
that... Miss Pommery '26,
I rather like.

01:44:21.976 --> 01:44:24.706
- But a man expects his wife...
- To behave herself. Naturally.

01:44:24.779 --> 01:44:26.713
To behave herself naturally.

01:44:28.849 --> 01:44:30.180
Sorry.

01:44:31.819 --> 01:44:35.949
If it hadn't been for that drink last
night, all this might not have happened.

01:44:36.023 --> 01:44:38.457
Apparently nothing did.

01:44:38.526 --> 01:44:40.494
What made you think it had?

01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:42.756
Well, it didn't take
much imagination.

01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:46.163
Not much, perhaps,
but just of a certain kind.

01:44:46.233 --> 01:44:48.326
It seems you didn't think
anything too well of yourself.

01:44:48.402 --> 01:44:50.029
That's the odd thing.

01:44:50.104 --> 01:44:53.540
Somehow I'd have hoped that you'd
think better of me than I did.

01:44:53.607 --> 01:44:56.269
I'm not going to quibble.
All the evidence was there.

01:44:56.344 --> 01:44:59.404
And I was guilty straight off
until I was proved innocent.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.505
Downright un-American,
if you ask me.

01:45:01.582 --> 01:45:04.016
Nobody is asking you.

01:45:04.085 --> 01:45:06.076
You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.

01:45:06.153 --> 01:45:09.611
You look lovely, Miss Tracy.
All our very best wishes.

01:45:11.659 --> 01:45:15.254
Dexter, I wish you'd let me know when
you invite people to Tracy's weddings.

01:45:15.329 --> 01:45:17.559
- What happened, darling?
- A Mr. Sidney Kidd is here.

01:45:17.631 --> 01:45:19.656
He says he knows you.

01:45:19.734 --> 01:45:22.032
Sidney Kidd is here himself?

01:45:22.103 --> 01:45:24.264
What else did Mr. Sidney Kidd
have to say?

01:45:24.338 --> 01:45:28.536
He sent you the strangest message.
He said, "Tell Haven he wins."

01:45:28.609 --> 01:45:31.772
"Tell him I'm licked."
Wins what, Dexter?

01:45:34.615 --> 01:45:38.642
Mr. Sidney Kidd's presence here makes
the marriage of national importance.

01:45:38.719 --> 01:45:41.187
I think it's extremely kind
and thoughtful of him.

01:45:44.325 --> 01:45:47.453
Come on, Tracy, it must be late.
Let's let bygones be bygones.

01:45:47.528 --> 01:45:49.393
What do you say?

01:45:49.463 --> 01:45:52.557
Yes, and good-bye, George.

01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:56.192
- I don't understand you.
- Please, good-bye.

01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:58.204
- Look here...
- You're too good for me.

01:45:58.272 --> 01:46:00.263
- You're a hundred times too good.
- But I never said...

01:46:00.341 --> 01:46:02.775
I'd make you most unhappy. Most.

01:46:03.844 --> 01:46:05.937
That is, I'd do my best to.

01:46:07.014 --> 01:46:09.881
Well, if that's
the way you want it.

01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:11.941
That's the way it is.

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.884
All right.
Possibly it's just as well.

01:46:15.956 --> 01:46:18.288
Yes, I thought you'd finally
come to that conclusion.

01:46:20.394 --> 01:46:23.090
I have a feeling you had more
to do with this than anyone.

01:46:23.164 --> 01:46:27.260
- Possibly, but you were a great help.
- You and your whole rotten class.

01:46:27.334 --> 01:46:29.199
Class, my eye.

01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:32.137
You're on your way out,
the lot of you, and good riddance!

01:46:34.508 --> 01:46:36.703
There goes George.

01:46:44.518 --> 01:46:47.180
Oh, my sainted aunt!

01:46:58.098 --> 01:47:01.226
- That welter of faces.
- Oh, my, they look solemn.

01:47:01.302 --> 01:47:03.133
What am I to do?

01:47:03.204 --> 01:47:04.637
- Tracy?
- Yes, Mike?

01:47:04.705 --> 01:47:07.469
Parson Parsons has never seen
Kittredge before, has he?

01:47:07.541 --> 01:47:11.238
I got you into this thing,
and I'll get you out of it.

01:47:11.312 --> 01:47:13.303
Will you marry me, Tracy?

01:47:19.487 --> 01:47:20.784
No, Mike.

01:47:21.856 --> 01:47:26.088
Thanks, but hmm-mm. Nope.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.128
I've never asked a girl
to marry me.

01:47:28.195 --> 01:47:29.753
I've avoided it.

01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:32.196
But you've got me
all confused now.

01:47:32.266 --> 01:47:33.631
Why not?

01:47:34.935 --> 01:47:37.369
Because I don't think Liz
would like it...

01:47:38.739 --> 01:47:41.299
and I'm not sure you would...

01:47:41.375 --> 01:47:45.038
and I'm even a little doubtful
about myself.

01:47:46.113 --> 01:47:48.843
But I am beholden to you, Mike.

01:47:48.916 --> 01:47:51.248
I'm most beholden.

01:47:52.486 --> 01:47:54.750
But they're in there.
They're waiting.

01:47:54.822 --> 01:47:58.417
Don't get too conventional all at once,
will ya? There'll be a reaction.

01:48:00.828 --> 01:48:04.958
Cheer up. It'll be all right.
You've been got out of jams before.

01:48:05.032 --> 01:48:07.023
- Been got out of them?
- Certainly.

01:48:07.101 --> 01:48:09.592
Don't worry.
You always have been.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.767
We've seen George.
It's all right, dear.

01:48:14.842 --> 01:48:16.833
Your father will make
a very simple announcement.

01:48:16.911 --> 01:48:19.778
Is there anything special
you want me to say, Tracy?

01:48:19.847 --> 01:48:23.374
Uh, no, no.
I'll say it.

01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:27.386
Whatever it is, I'll say it. I won't
be got out of anything anymore, thanks.

01:48:36.463 --> 01:48:38.454
Hello.

01:48:38.532 --> 01:48:41.558
Good morning. L...
Stop that music.

01:48:42.903 --> 01:48:45.098
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting...

01:48:45.172 --> 01:48:50.109
but there's been a slight hitch
in the proceedings.

01:48:50.177 --> 01:48:54.273
I've made a terrible fool of myself,
which isn't unusual...

01:48:54.348 --> 01:48:58.682
and my fiancé...
my fiancé that was, that is...

01:48:58.752 --> 01:49:03.416
he thinks we'd better call it a day,
and I quite agree with him.

01:49:04.325 --> 01:49:06.054
Peace is wonderful.

01:49:06.126 --> 01:49:09.425
Uh, bec... uh...
Dexter, what next?

01:49:09.496 --> 01:49:12.761
Three years ago I did you out of
a wedding in this house by eloping.

01:49:12.833 --> 01:49:17.668
- Two years ago, you were invited...
- My dear, just a loan.

01:49:17.738 --> 01:49:19.763
- Put this in your vest pocket.
- Don't have a vest.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.831
Then hold it in your hand.

01:49:21.909 --> 01:49:24.503
- Which was very bad manners.
- Which was very bad manners.

01:49:24.578 --> 01:49:27.741
I'll make it up to you by going through
with it now as originally planned.

01:49:27.815 --> 01:49:29.806
I'll make it up to you by...

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:36.913
by going beautifully through
with it now...

01:49:36.991 --> 01:49:40.688
as originally and
most beautifully planned.

01:49:40.761 --> 01:49:44.060
- So if you'll just keep your seats...
- So if you'll just keep your seats...

01:49:44.131 --> 01:49:47.157
- That's all.
- Um, that's all.

01:49:47.234 --> 01:49:49.532
- Are you sure?
- No, but I'll risk it. Will you?

01:49:49.603 --> 01:49:53.630
You bet. You didn't do it to soften
the blow? Nor to save my face?

01:49:53.707 --> 01:49:55.766
- No, it's a nice face.
- I'll be yare now.

01:49:55.843 --> 01:49:59.142
- I'll promise to be yare.
- Be whatever you like. You all set?

01:49:59.213 --> 01:50:00.976
- All set.
- Best man?

01:50:01.048 --> 01:50:02.879
Honored, C.K.

01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:05.009
- Maid of honor?
- Matron of honor.

01:50:05.085 --> 01:50:06.609
Remember Joe Smith.

01:50:06.687 --> 01:50:08.621
How did this ever happen?

01:50:09.857 --> 01:50:11.848
You'd better tell Mr. Dutton
to start the music.

01:50:11.925 --> 01:50:14.917
This can't be happening. It just can't.
Come with me, Miss Imbrie.

01:50:14.995 --> 01:50:16.929
Let's get in there.
Got the ring?

01:50:16.997 --> 01:50:19.625
The way we're dressed,
we look like stowaways.

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.167
See ya soon, Red.

01:50:21.235 --> 01:50:22.668
See ya soon, Dext.

01:50:26.907 --> 01:50:28.932
- Tracy, darling...
- I love you, Father.

01:50:29.009 --> 01:50:30.169
I love you too.

01:50:30.244 --> 01:50:33.042
Never in my life have I been
so full of love before.

01:50:33.113 --> 01:50:35.206
Come along. Come along.

01:50:35.282 --> 01:50:37.113
Wait. How do I look?

01:50:37.184 --> 01:50:39.812
Like a queen.
Like a goddess.

01:50:39.887 --> 01:50:42.082
- And you know how I feel?
- How?

01:50:42.156 --> 01:50:44.522
Like a human.
Like a human being.

01:50:44.591 --> 01:50:47.116
