00:58.697 --> 01:00.564
Why do they always
wet themselves?

01:00.566 --> 01:02.232
Just get on with the task.

01:08.072 --> 01:10.340
- They got books.
- Well, shake 'em out.

01:10.342 --> 01:12.275
See if money comes
out the pages.

01:14.177 --> 01:16.245
It won't be in the
table of contents.

01:17.213 --> 01:19.847
Save them jokes that nobody
likes for the campfire.

01:39.602 --> 01:41.169
You didn't cut him deep enough.

01:41.904 --> 01:45.607
He had a lot of blood.
An unusual amount.

01:45.609 --> 01:47.608
He has the same as every other.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.343
Help me up.

01:57.119 --> 02:01.222
There are 16 major
veins in the neck

02:01.224 --> 02:03.458
and you have to cut
through 'em all.

02:03.460 --> 02:05.226
There ain't 16.

02:05.228 --> 02:06.760
My uncle had
an acquaintance with

02:06.762 --> 02:08.661
a man who used to be a doctor

02:08.663 --> 02:09.829
and that's what he said.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.798
Now you get on with the task.

02:13.599 --> 02:15.367
Worthless.

02:16.001 --> 02:18.068
Don't throw no Bibles in there.

02:18.436 --> 02:20.637
I know it's bad luck.

02:21.406 --> 02:24.074
Besides you can always
sell them to some idiot.

02:32.183 --> 02:33.884
Buddy...

02:34.318 --> 02:35.851
I hear horses.

02:35.853 --> 02:37.252
Are you certain?

02:38.521 --> 02:40.054
Positively.

02:40.989 --> 02:43.657
Damn! It was that gun shot.

02:43.659 --> 02:45.493
A bat in China
could've heard that.

02:45.495 --> 02:46.894
That's a full gallop.

02:47.328 --> 02:49.896
We're gonna have to get up
there in them rocks and hide.

03:07.150 --> 03:09.051
Fifteen minutes 'til
they get there.

03:09.053 --> 03:10.385
Scurry.

03:14.123 --> 03:15.356
You hear that?

03:15.358 --> 03:16.657
It was a gust.

03:16.659 --> 03:18.659
That's a real musical gust.

03:18.661 --> 03:20.027
And?

03:20.029 --> 03:21.462
It's ominous.

03:21.464 --> 03:24.898
This is not the time for
womanly imaginings.

03:25.566 --> 03:26.732
Go.

03:32.372 --> 03:35.308
What's that? A wolf?

03:35.310 --> 03:37.043
Bear, looks like.

03:44.184 --> 03:47.987
Is this some kind of sign?
"Keep Out" or something.

03:47.989 --> 03:49.555
We got permission.

03:56.096 --> 03:57.396
Was that us?

04:00.700 --> 04:03.903
I thought the sun was
in the other direction.

04:03.905 --> 04:05.437
Well, it's here now.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.338
Get.

04:18.784 --> 04:20.851
That's where we're goin'.

04:20.853 --> 04:23.788
Straight through this
place and deeper in.

04:23.790 --> 04:25.689
Maybe we shouldn't
be going some place

04:25.691 --> 04:27.558
that looks like a
burial ground.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.893
To a bunch of godless savages.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.462
Ain't no concern of
the civilized man.

04:43.641 --> 04:45.809
A jail on fire is safer
than a place like this.

04:45.811 --> 04:48.044
It's better than sittin'
in that damn gulch,

04:48.046 --> 04:51.281
riders comin' in from one way
and savages the other.

04:51.283 --> 04:52.782
You want to go back there, go.

05:02.626 --> 05:05.794
If that was a gust,
then it learned an instrument!

05:11.634 --> 05:12.900
Listen clear!

05:13.101 --> 05:15.182
We're comin' through here,
like it or not!

05:21.510 --> 05:22.810
Buddy!

05:22.812 --> 05:24.011
Oh, Je...

06:03.354 --> 06:04.887
<i>Would you like some coffee?</i>

06:05.622 --> 06:07.756
No reason to stay up.

06:09.359 --> 06:11.860
More sleeping I do,
quicker Autumn'll get here.

06:13.230 --> 06:14.562
Uh-oh.

06:16.299 --> 06:17.632
Arthur O'Dwyer!

06:18.367 --> 06:20.401
You look real pretty
when you're upset.

06:20.403 --> 06:23.238
Do you intend to sit and
sulk for the next 12 weeks?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.006
Well, what do you
want me to do?

06:25.008 --> 06:27.509
I advised you not to work on
the roof during the storm,

06:27.511 --> 06:29.143
but you went up regardless,

06:29.145 --> 06:31.378
because you had "a notion
to get things done".

06:31.380 --> 06:33.381
But there's no reason
to go over that again.

06:33.383 --> 06:34.815
Didn't you just?

06:34.817 --> 06:36.416
So is this your intention?

06:36.650 --> 06:38.550
Is what my intention?

06:38.552 --> 06:39.852
To sulk for 12 weeks?

06:39.854 --> 06:42.020
I'm not sulking, I'm sour.

06:42.022 --> 06:44.102
- Don't dodge.
- What do you want me to say?

06:46.259 --> 06:50.061
I moved beeves all over the
map, with all sorts of crews

06:50.063 --> 06:52.297
from terrible to worse
to get this position.

06:53.532 --> 06:55.332
You know all that I've done.

06:57.336 --> 07:00.171
This was the big payoff
and now I'm stuck.

07:00.739 --> 07:02.807
I understand how
disappointing this is.

07:04.209 --> 07:06.343
Lot of guys never get
to be a foreman.

07:06.345 --> 07:08.305
And when I finally do,
this happens.

07:08.947 --> 07:11.048
They'll be gone until autumn.
And you're here...

07:11.050 --> 07:12.249
I know my situation.

07:12.251 --> 07:13.683
You're here with me.

07:14.284 --> 07:16.085
You're here with me
for a longer duration

07:16.087 --> 07:18.047
than any time since
we were married.

07:18.554 --> 07:20.621
Can't you see it's not all bad?

07:28.798 --> 07:30.298
Of course I can.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.817
And not just 'cause you're
prettier than most cows.

07:36.104 --> 07:37.471
Most?

07:37.473 --> 07:39.640
You never saw Jessica.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.331
Why so quiet?

08:05.900 --> 08:07.834
They rode out the
beeves yesterday.

08:08.168 --> 08:10.003
Like I told you yesterday.

08:10.005 --> 08:11.337
Nobody left here but

08:11.339 --> 08:13.372
wives, kids

08:14.140 --> 08:15.641
and dead-enders.

08:30.957 --> 08:32.424
Good evening, Mr. Brooder.

08:32.859 --> 08:34.058
Good evening.

08:36.095 --> 08:37.528
It's like a church in here

08:38.462 --> 08:40.498
though it lacks
even pious women.

08:40.664 --> 08:43.433
Well, why don't you
patronage the man

08:43.434 --> 08:45.135
over there by the pianoforte?

08:45.137 --> 08:47.370
It might enliven things a bit.

08:58.449 --> 08:59.582
Pardon me.

09:00.784 --> 09:01.950
Good evening.

09:01.952 --> 09:05.454
If one song costs three cents,
why do three songs cost a dime?

09:05.456 --> 09:06.855
That's the rate.

09:06.857 --> 09:08.791
Shouldn't the price
per song get cheaper

09:08.793 --> 09:10.058
when more are commissioned?

09:10.325 --> 09:12.793
Well, I get tired after two, so

09:13.194 --> 09:14.929
the third costs extra.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.130
Do four songs cost a dollar?

09:17.531 --> 09:20.132
Buy a song or depart.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.275
That was a dime.

09:30.877 --> 09:33.646
I know the sound
of Lady Liberty.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.151
I'll have whisky.

09:42.822 --> 09:44.155
Whiskey.

09:45.391 --> 09:46.657
Sir.

10:01.707 --> 10:03.008
Good evening, sheriff.

10:03.342 --> 10:04.475
Chicory.

10:05.410 --> 10:08.077
I was out for a ramble and...

10:09.346 --> 10:12.180
Oh, that tea smells gruesome.

10:13.582 --> 10:14.749
It's soup.

10:14.751 --> 10:15.850
Oh.

10:17.085 --> 10:19.286
You... You think I
could have some?

10:19.754 --> 10:23.523
I haven't had a good meal
today. Maybe not anything.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.960
Nab that chair and sit.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.140
I forgot the spoons.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.241
You think you can drink this
without burnin' your mouth?

10:42.243 --> 10:43.809
Oh, I like challenges.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.983
Oh, boy, that smells good.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.504
Now that I know it's not
supposed to be tea.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.495
You need to make sure

11:03.896 --> 11:06.564
you have a couple of
good meals every day.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.500
Can't have my backup
deputy pass out

11:08.502 --> 11:10.001
'cause he forgot to eat.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.902
No, no, sir.
That would be shameful.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.770
- No, sir.
- Let it cool.

11:13.772 --> 11:14.972
Oh.

11:22.514 --> 11:25.582
You were gonna tell
me about your ramble.

11:26.116 --> 11:28.818
Oh, yeah. Glad you reminded me.

11:29.352 --> 11:31.820
I was out on a ramble,
a night ramble.

11:31.822 --> 11:33.783
You know, just to
get some clean air

11:34.491 --> 11:37.258
and put some fresh flowers
on Nadine's grave.

11:39.028 --> 11:40.428
You know...

11:43.764 --> 11:45.265
And,

11:45.267 --> 11:48.501
when I do, I decided
to go the long way.

11:49.870 --> 11:54.874
You know, like the Serrano
does on patrol over in Spain.

11:54.876 --> 11:58.144
And when I do, I see this
fella on the perimeter.

11:58.146 --> 12:00.880
Sheriff, I don't know him.

12:05.553 --> 12:07.219
This tastes like corn.

12:09.823 --> 12:11.690
It's corn chowder.

12:13.526 --> 12:16.695
Oh, then things are lining up.

12:21.034 --> 12:23.234
So, did he do anything?

12:25.303 --> 12:26.770
The stranger?

12:29.306 --> 12:30.706
Take your time.

12:32.175 --> 12:35.978
He changed his clothes,
and he took some luggage

12:35.980 --> 12:38.213
and he threw it in a
hole and covered it up.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.748
He went to town.

12:43.018 --> 12:44.986
It is the official opinion
of the backup deputy

12:44.988 --> 12:46.887
that his manner was suspicious.

13:00.369 --> 13:01.569
Where is he?

13:02.003 --> 13:03.137
Who?

13:03.371 --> 13:04.738
The stranger.

13:05.005 --> 13:06.925
Oh, he's over at
the Learned Goat.

13:19.353 --> 13:20.619
Let's go make a survey.

13:45.879 --> 13:47.279
How's your tibia?

13:47.281 --> 13:49.241
Not thinking about
Tibias right now.

14:02.663 --> 14:03.763
Ow!

14:03.765 --> 14:04.997
Did I hurt you?

14:06.332 --> 14:07.832
Let's do this the right way.

14:07.834 --> 14:10.001
Is that supposed
to be a criticism?

14:11.903 --> 14:13.169
It's instinct.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.545
- Yeah.
- Careful.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.986
Are you sure you're able to...

14:32.090 --> 14:33.491
Please continue.

14:43.101 --> 14:45.069
What's your
predilection, mister?

14:46.037 --> 14:48.438
You look like you could
use something potent.

14:48.939 --> 14:50.273
Or omnipotent.

14:51.341 --> 14:52.708
My brother makes this.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.578
It's like a tree fell on you.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.747
Redwood.

15:17.201 --> 15:19.168
Sheriff, it's quiet
enough in here

15:19.170 --> 15:20.870
without the two of
you comin' in here

15:20.872 --> 15:22.404
and scarin' everybody off.

15:22.406 --> 15:24.439
- We got business.
- Important.

15:28.477 --> 15:29.710
Good evening.

15:35.648 --> 15:38.049
You aren't mute, are you?

15:38.051 --> 15:39.384
No.

15:40.386 --> 15:43.454
In civilized towns,
places like Bright Hope,

15:44.055 --> 15:46.723
you look a man direct in the
face when you talk to him.

15:48.992 --> 15:50.393
I didn't do nothing wrong.

15:50.395 --> 15:52.528
I'm just sat in here
having a drink.

15:52.530 --> 15:54.530
I didn't say you did
anything wrong.

15:54.532 --> 15:55.964
What's your name?

15:58.168 --> 15:59.868
Buddy.

15:59.870 --> 16:02.103
Took a moment to recall that,
didn't it?

16:03.339 --> 16:04.372
My name is Buddy.

16:04.374 --> 16:05.506
Why are you here?

16:07.709 --> 16:09.143
I'm going to meet someone.

16:09.444 --> 16:10.610
What's today's date?

16:11.912 --> 16:14.414
It seems like if you had
a rendezvous scheduled

16:14.416 --> 16:15.581
you'd know what day it was.

16:15.915 --> 16:18.082
Let me give you an
easier question.

16:18.883 --> 16:20.451
Who did you steal
those clothes from?

16:20.453 --> 16:22.085
I ain't stole nothing!

16:22.953 --> 16:25.820
Why, you're pretty angry
for a guy named "Buddy".

16:27.290 --> 16:29.124
You've been squirting
lemon juice

16:29.126 --> 16:31.259
in my eye since
you came in here.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.628
I didn't commit no crime.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.830
And why are you talkin'
about crime now?

16:36.898 --> 16:38.733
Are you carrying a weapon?

16:38.735 --> 16:42.869
A gun, knife, a letter
opener with a sharp point?

16:43.637 --> 16:44.838
Dynamite?

16:45.639 --> 16:46.739
Nope.

16:46.741 --> 16:48.540
- Deputy.
- Raise your hands.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.210
If you move in a hasty manner,
I'll put a bullet in you.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.682
That's the only thing.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.550
Like I just told you,
I ain't got no weapon.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.685
Because you put 'em
in that hole you dug?

17:10.428 --> 17:12.127
- You alright, old man?
- Oh, yeah.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.662
Oh, I thought I had him.

17:16.465 --> 17:17.866
Grab an arm.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.067
Brooder,

17:20.269 --> 17:22.068
rouse Doc Taylor.

17:24.671 --> 17:26.739
Put coffee in him
if he's liquored.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.178
It's supposed to be elevated
above your heart.

18:04.548 --> 18:06.715
Is this why you buy
so many pillows?

18:06.949 --> 18:10.018
I buy pillows because
they're pretty.

18:11.487 --> 18:13.253
This isn't comfortable.

18:15.523 --> 18:17.223
Well, it's not supposed to be.

18:17.557 --> 18:19.190
So it's correct.

18:24.496 --> 18:25.729
How does it look?

18:26.465 --> 18:27.765
The same.

18:35.307 --> 18:39.010
You know, once the
hellish burnin' stops

18:39.012 --> 18:42.413
feels almost nice. Thank you.

18:42.415 --> 18:43.914
You are very welcome.

18:45.851 --> 18:49.119
You're takin' good care of me.
Anything I can do for you?

18:52.090 --> 18:53.490
Yes.

19:02.234 --> 19:04.268
Would you read this out loud?

19:04.502 --> 19:06.935
It's the poem that you
wrote in Wyoming.

19:08.204 --> 19:09.938
Oh, it ain't a poem.

19:09.940 --> 19:14.977
It's just some things I was
thinking and some emotions.

19:16.879 --> 19:18.212
Would you read it to me?

19:18.214 --> 19:19.346
Well...

19:21.450 --> 19:24.317
Feel stupid if I
read it out loud.

19:25.185 --> 19:28.421
It will not. It's beautiful.

19:29.389 --> 19:31.857
Whenever I was alone
I would read it

19:31.859 --> 19:33.626
and I would feel better.

19:34.461 --> 19:35.828
Please?

19:37.864 --> 19:39.945
I can't think of a
polite way out of this.

19:40.366 --> 19:42.467
That's because there isn't...

19:43.769 --> 19:45.103
What time is it?

19:46.105 --> 19:48.172
Half past ten.

19:52.111 --> 19:54.579
<i>Mr. and Mrs. O'Dwyer.
It's John Brooder.</i>

19:54.581 --> 19:56.542
<i>I'm here regarding
a medical matter.</i>

20:13.099 --> 20:14.633
Good evening, Mrs. O'Dwyer.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.634
Are you hurt?

20:17.168 --> 20:19.469
Oh, I'm not the injured
party, there was...

20:19.937 --> 20:22.306
A drifter that got quick
with the sheriff.

20:22.573 --> 20:23.940
Shot in the leg?

20:23.942 --> 20:25.141
Shot in the leg.

20:25.575 --> 20:27.476
And, Doc Taylor's in his cups?

20:27.478 --> 20:30.011
Deep. I took his equipment.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.679
I have my own.

20:32.114 --> 20:34.248
Does yours contain two
bottles of vodka?

20:36.017 --> 20:37.550
Where's the drifter?

20:38.819 --> 20:39.985
He's in jail.

20:43.956 --> 20:45.190
Arthur?

20:45.192 --> 20:46.591
<i>Yeah?</i>

20:47.025 --> 20:51.328
I need to extract a bullet.
Mr. Brooder shall escort me.

20:51.330 --> 20:54.164
<i>Okay. John?</i>

20:54.465 --> 20:55.665
Yes?

20:56.167 --> 20:58.134
<i>If you make any
flirtatious remarks</i>

20:58.136 --> 20:59.502
<i>in my wife's presence</i>

20:59.504 --> 21:00.836
<i>there'll be a reckoning.</i>

21:01.804 --> 21:03.338
I'll behave, cowboy.

21:08.477 --> 21:10.377
<i>Please keep your leg elevated.</i>

21:13.847 --> 21:15.048
I'll do it.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.286
Bye.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.720
<i>Bye.</i>

21:29.028 --> 21:30.528
You have a gift.

21:31.630 --> 21:35.199
I have four brothers and
grew up in cold weather.

21:35.733 --> 21:37.333
Checkers is all we did.

21:37.335 --> 21:40.070
You ever beat Nick
in a checkers match?

21:40.072 --> 21:43.406
Nope. Though we
only played twice.

21:43.975 --> 21:46.643
I haven't had a different
result in a 100 games.

21:47.411 --> 21:49.378
Maybe I shouldn't bet.

21:51.849 --> 21:52.882
What's that?

21:52.884 --> 21:54.617
A blonde hair.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.920
Looks like from a woman.

21:57.922 --> 21:59.882
I told you his manner
was suspicious.

22:01.891 --> 22:03.258
That's you, Doc?

22:03.659 --> 22:05.960
<i>It's John Brooder.
I brought Mrs. O'Dwyer.</i>

22:09.098 --> 22:10.832
Good evening, Mrs. O'Dwyer.

22:10.834 --> 22:12.233
Ma'am.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.535
Thank you for comin'.

22:14.537 --> 22:16.136
Happy to help.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.471
You can go.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.007
You're welcome.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.311
Fling the gate.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.514
What do you need from us?

22:30.516 --> 22:32.850
- A pot of boiling water.
- I'll get it.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.524
Can you remove his chains?

22:40.526 --> 22:41.958
No, ma'am.

22:42.793 --> 22:44.394
He's that dangerous?

22:44.396 --> 22:47.029
He buried that stuff
outside of town.

22:47.031 --> 22:49.531
It's not his, and it's got
bloodstains all over it.

22:49.533 --> 22:51.066
He's boiling.

22:51.068 --> 22:52.367
I only shot him in the leg.

22:52.369 --> 22:54.802
- Well, that's his hobby.
- Deputy.

22:54.804 --> 22:58.139
Not every man who leaps in
front of your pistol is hale.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.607
Do what you can for him.

23:01.208 --> 23:04.244
Very likely he's gonna get
hanged but it'd be nice

23:04.246 --> 23:06.913
if the families of the people he
bushwhacked could come to town

23:06.915 --> 23:08.115
and watch him
go purple on the rope.

23:08.117 --> 23:09.950
Well, that should inspire her.

23:09.952 --> 23:11.384
Deputy.

23:11.386 --> 23:12.918
I want you to stay
here tonight.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.754
Help Mrs. O'Dwyer with
whatever she needs.

23:14.756 --> 23:18.124
Lock everything up and escort
her home when she's done.

23:18.126 --> 23:20.727
Isn't that why we have
a backup deputy for?

23:20.729 --> 23:22.228
Oh, no, I'll take
care of things.

23:22.230 --> 23:23.562
I don't sleep few hours,
anyway.

23:23.564 --> 23:24.629
Nick stays.

23:24.631 --> 23:26.732
I want you to get some rest.

23:26.734 --> 23:28.667
You did real good tonight.

23:28.968 --> 23:30.034
Oh!

23:34.139 --> 23:35.472
Does he have a name?

23:37.675 --> 23:39.143
He proffered "Buddy"

23:39.344 --> 23:41.678
but that's probably somebody
he hates or who's dead.

23:44.015 --> 23:47.150
Very well. Please let my
husband know not to wait up.

23:47.152 --> 23:48.784
I'll need to stay and

23:48.786 --> 23:50.686
monitor the patient's fever
after the surgery.

23:50.688 --> 23:51.987
Yes, ma'am.

23:53.189 --> 23:54.489
Chicory.

23:55.624 --> 23:56.825
Wait a minute.

23:57.092 --> 23:57.958
Hey, I'm doin' lot better
than I thought.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.359
Much better.

23:59.526 --> 24:01.560
You're looking at my
side of the board.

24:02.462 --> 24:03.829
Good night.

24:04.163 --> 24:05.196
Good night, Mrs. O'Dwyer.

24:05.198 --> 24:06.397
Good night.

24:07.098 --> 24:08.499
Good night, ma'am.

24:18.509 --> 24:19.675
It's heating up.

24:20.144 --> 24:22.264
Please don't stick your
fingers in the water.

24:22.478 --> 24:23.878
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

24:27.316 --> 24:28.749
Thanks for lettin' me know.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.117
Thanks for loanin' her out.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.053
So, Deputy Nick's
gonna bring her back?

24:34.454 --> 24:35.554
He will.

24:37.156 --> 24:38.557
How's your wife doing?

24:39.792 --> 24:42.160
Better. Thought maybe
it was pneumonia

24:42.162 --> 24:44.463
but seems like it was
just a bad cold.

24:45.531 --> 24:48.198
Good to hear.
Give her my regards.

24:49.133 --> 24:50.434
I will.

24:52.470 --> 24:53.703
Good night.

25:15.393 --> 25:16.826
Dear Samantha,

25:17.227 --> 25:19.996
I hope things are going good
for you back in Bright Hope.

25:19.998 --> 25:22.465
And that Doc Taylor
is drinking less.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.900
I am in Wyoming now.

25:25.234 --> 25:27.869
The ride here was
long and difficult

25:27.871 --> 25:30.404
and the foreman had to
discipline a lot of men

25:30.406 --> 25:32.507
and let some go

25:32.509 --> 25:34.408
which made things harder for
the rest of us,

25:34.410 --> 25:36.643
especially in
this cold weather.

25:37.544 --> 25:40.413
I've been in charge of the
night round-up for a while

25:40.415 --> 25:42.335
and I've organized
it pretty good.

25:42.715 --> 25:46.018
Sometimes when I'm working long

25:46.020 --> 25:48.553
I look at the faces
of the other cowboys

25:48.555 --> 25:51.789
and I can see that they're
miserable all the way through.

25:52.290 --> 25:54.391
But since I met you

25:54.393 --> 25:57.194
I don't get that feeling
anymore like I used to.

25:58.462 --> 26:02.098
You give me this warmth
in my direct center

26:02.100 --> 26:05.266
that won't turn cold no
matter what happens out here.

26:06.568 --> 26:09.904
The other day I saw these
hills on the border

26:09.906 --> 26:12.706
and the shapes of them
reminded me of you

26:12.708 --> 26:15.042
when you are next to me
in bed on your side.

26:16.544 --> 26:20.113
Sometimes I see you in the
waterfalls and the clouds and

26:21.582 --> 26:25.217
always you have that real
happy look on your face

26:25.219 --> 26:27.286
like when I come
back from being away

26:28.087 --> 26:32.124
and we are about to kiss for
the first time in months.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.963
That ain't a poem.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.000
No, ma'am.

27:16.103 --> 27:18.571
My body feels like cotton.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.273
I gave you some
tincture of opium.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.911
Are you done?

27:26.479 --> 27:28.746
I need to clean the
wound and sew it shut.

28:11.391 --> 28:13.993
I'm coming, ladies. Don't fret.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.108
Mr. Wallington?

28:29.742 --> 28:31.142
Is that you?

29:07.983 --> 29:09.817
Samantha, you back yet?

29:14.222 --> 29:15.855
Sam?

29:24.798 --> 29:27.066
Told you last night
I'd make breakfast.

29:27.068 --> 29:29.668
- Why don't you go back to bed?
- I'd like to do it, Franklin.

29:30.503 --> 29:32.171
I'm feeling better today.

29:32.572 --> 29:34.639
You were feelin'
better last night.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.975
You're a remedy.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.547
And you're makin' fry bread.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.516
Well, that's my intention.

29:47.150 --> 29:51.287
But where'd you put the spoons?
They're no place logical.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.355
I thought you'd
explain that enigma.

29:54.423 --> 29:56.491
<i>Sheriff Hunt?</i>

29:57.659 --> 29:59.326
Is that you, Clarence?

29:59.328 --> 30:00.493
<i>It's me.</i>

30:00.495 --> 30:01.495
The door is open.

30:04.865 --> 30:07.132
Why are you in my breakfast?

30:07.134 --> 30:10.368
There's a situation.

30:10.969 --> 30:12.069
Serious.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.038
I'll leave you two.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.073
Talk.

30:18.340 --> 30:20.041
This morning I went out
to tend to my colt,

30:20.043 --> 30:22.676
needed a new shoe and
when I got there...

30:23.344 --> 30:25.445
I saw Buford, the stable boy,

30:25.647 --> 30:29.649
he was lying there dead,
he was all torn up.

30:29.651 --> 30:31.150
An animal got to him?

30:31.152 --> 30:33.286
I don't know. I couldn't say.
I just...

30:33.288 --> 30:34.409
I didn't care to linger.

30:34.788 --> 30:36.488
You know, I just went
down to the office

30:36.490 --> 30:39.358
to try and get a deputy
but when I went inside

30:39.360 --> 30:40.892
there was nobody in there.

30:40.894 --> 30:42.026
Nobody?

30:42.727 --> 30:44.528
Not even in the jail cell?

30:44.962 --> 30:46.729
No, sir, completely empty.

30:47.530 --> 30:48.863
Go up the street, fetch Chicory

30:48.865 --> 30:50.131
and meet me
in front of the stable.

30:50.133 --> 30:51.265
Yes, sir.

31:02.979 --> 31:04.212
Get some distance.

31:11.087 --> 31:15.156
Listen Up! This is
Sheriff Franklin Hunt.

31:15.857 --> 31:18.892
If anybody is in there,
identify yourself right now

31:18.894 --> 31:20.561
or I'll shoot you dead.

31:52.229 --> 31:53.662
Poor kid.

31:56.099 --> 31:59.267
How many horses does Wallington
usually keep in here?

31:59.269 --> 32:02.504
Well, there was
my colt and he kept five.

32:04.306 --> 32:06.106
Let's get to the jail.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.413
Oh!

32:55.095 --> 32:56.262
Indians?

32:56.663 --> 32:58.864
Looks like it, but I...

32:59.365 --> 33:00.932
I don't reckon.

33:16.718 --> 33:19.420
Fetch the professor and bring
him to The Learned Goat.

33:19.621 --> 33:20.854
Show him that.

33:27.495 --> 33:29.562
I'll be there in
about 20 minutes.

33:30.397 --> 33:32.465
Are you going to
talk to Mr. O'Dwyer?

33:33.834 --> 33:35.267
Yeah.

33:56.559 --> 33:58.092
Sheriff,

33:58.393 --> 34:00.226
is my wife still at the jail?

34:02.496 --> 34:06.332
Let's talk inside, Mr. O'Dwyer.

34:06.334 --> 34:07.934
Did something happen?

34:09.202 --> 34:11.069
Let's talk where you can sit.

34:11.071 --> 34:12.737
Tell me here and tell me plain.

34:14.674 --> 34:16.808
Mrs. O'Dwyer was abducted.

34:18.177 --> 34:20.545
I think you should go back
inside and sit down.

34:20.547 --> 34:22.389
- We can talk...
- Who took her?

34:24.016 --> 34:25.617
Looks like Indians.

34:26.118 --> 34:27.650
Got Nick, too.

34:28.018 --> 34:29.518
We're meeting at
The Learned Goat

34:29.521 --> 34:31.362
to talk about what can be done.

34:53.813 --> 34:55.112
Clarence?

34:55.915 --> 34:58.783
Mr. O'Dwyer, please sit.

35:02.154 --> 35:03.521
Gizzard,

35:04.422 --> 35:05.722
can you brew some coffee?

35:05.724 --> 35:07.056
Is something amiss?

35:07.058 --> 35:08.224
Yeah.

35:08.491 --> 35:10.558
Put some whisky in his.

35:14.263 --> 35:16.931
Sheriff Hunt, what do you
intend to do about my horses?

35:16.933 --> 35:18.632
They are not my
priority right now.

35:18.634 --> 35:20.568
- Those are my finest...
- Quiet!

35:20.570 --> 35:23.037
Ask about horses again
I'll slap you red!

35:24.406 --> 35:26.047
You come along with me,
Mr. Wallington and

35:26.174 --> 35:28.534
I'm going to retrieve your
special bottle from the bar.

35:32.747 --> 35:34.513
I retrieved our expert.

35:37.183 --> 35:38.517
You know who did this?

35:39.252 --> 35:41.453
Only one group that
hunts with these.

35:41.455 --> 35:43.188
- Who?
- They don't have a name.

35:43.190 --> 35:45.090
What kind of tribe
doesn't have a name?

35:45.092 --> 35:46.925
One that doesn't
have a language.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.493
Cave dwellers.

35:50.430 --> 35:51.763
You know where they are?

35:52.498 --> 35:54.198
I have a general idea.

35:54.365 --> 35:56.266
- You'll take us to them?
- I won't.

35:56.268 --> 35:57.389
'Cause you're an Indian?

35:57.601 --> 35:58.434
Because I don't
want to get killed.

35:58.668 --> 35:59.634
You're afraid of your own kind?

35:59.636 --> 36:01.203
They're not my kind.

36:01.205 --> 36:03.138
They are a spoiled bloodline
of inbred animals

36:03.140 --> 36:05.206
who rape and eat
their own mothers.

36:06.541 --> 36:07.875
Well, what are they?

36:07.877 --> 36:09.342
Troglodytes.

36:11.611 --> 36:13.178
What do they look like?

36:15.315 --> 36:17.949
Man like you would not
distinguish them from Indians.

36:17.951 --> 36:20.352
Even though they are
something else entirely.

36:20.354 --> 36:22.020
Why would they tear
that stable boy up

36:22.022 --> 36:24.022
leave him but take
the others away?

36:24.890 --> 36:26.558
They don't eat Negroes.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.792
Do they think
they're poisonous?

36:27.794 --> 36:29.059
Chicory.

36:29.627 --> 36:31.548
You'll show us
where they are at?

36:32.297 --> 36:33.964
You'll be killed if you
enter their territory...

36:33.966 --> 36:35.298
That wasn't the question!

36:35.300 --> 36:36.732
Show us where they are at.

36:36.734 --> 36:38.801
We won't be dissuaded.

36:38.803 --> 36:41.203
Bring me a map of
the western range.

36:41.205 --> 36:42.871
We got an old survey map.

36:43.072 --> 36:44.540
You know where it is, Gizzard?

36:52.749 --> 36:55.016
Why was my husband, the mayor,

36:55.018 --> 36:57.319
not informed of this
situation immediately?

36:57.321 --> 36:59.988
Well, the sheriff,
he told me to go get him

36:59.990 --> 37:01.557
but I'm old and I forgot.

37:01.559 --> 37:03.258
Do you expect me
to believe that?

37:03.260 --> 37:04.726
I'm hoping.

37:05.060 --> 37:06.727
Was it Indians?

37:07.563 --> 37:09.263
Troglodytes.

37:13.735 --> 37:16.403
This empty area is
a mountain range.

37:16.405 --> 37:19.072
Forbidden territory,
it has been for centuries.

37:19.074 --> 37:20.941
And somewhere in
the northwestern part of it

37:20.943 --> 37:23.743
is a place my people call the
Valley of the Starving Men.

37:23.745 --> 37:25.666
Troglodytes are
said to live there.

37:26.047 --> 37:27.881
That's days from here.

37:27.883 --> 37:29.449
How many of them do
you think there are?

37:29.451 --> 37:30.650
Well, it won't matter.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.246
You have no chance against
any number of them.

37:35.355 --> 37:36.955
I'm riding out with Mr. O'Dwyer

37:37.857 --> 37:40.018
because there isn't a
choice for either of us.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.025
The rest of you can stay.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.360
You'll be killed.

37:45.062 --> 37:46.162
I'm coming with you.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.530
No, I need you here,
I need you to keep an eye...

37:48.532 --> 37:50.799
No, I'm coming, I'm coming.

37:50.801 --> 37:53.067
Nick's gone and this is
what a backup is for.

37:53.069 --> 37:55.670
To help in an emergency,
not stay back. I'm coming.

37:57.873 --> 37:59.607
Alright, old man.

38:00.108 --> 38:01.609
This is suicide.

38:01.977 --> 38:03.544
I'll get packed and meet you in

38:03.546 --> 38:04.778
front of the jail
in 15 minutes.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.179
As will I.

38:07.549 --> 38:10.183
I'm the one who fetched
your wife and got her involved.

38:11.051 --> 38:13.186
I've got a responsibility
to you both.

38:13.787 --> 38:14.987
And I've killed more Indians

38:15.120 --> 38:16.787
than everyone here
put together.

38:16.789 --> 38:18.688
Well, that's an ugly boast.

38:19.090 --> 38:20.790
It isn't a boast

38:21.792 --> 38:23.359
but a fact.

38:29.266 --> 38:32.736
Telegraph Gatesville. Let 'em
know what happened here.

38:32.738 --> 38:33.970
Have 'em send a couple deputies

38:33.972 --> 38:35.738
to watch over things
while I'm gone.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.774
You should address
the mayor directly.

38:37.776 --> 38:40.643
- Yes, you should...
- Somebody should bury Buford.

38:41.478 --> 38:43.513
He's got no kin in Bright Hope.

38:43.515 --> 38:45.681
I'll have him blessed
and put underground.

38:45.683 --> 38:47.015
Appreciate it.

38:54.990 --> 38:58.259
Does anybody know how
to spell "Troglodytes"?

38:59.261 --> 39:00.594
For the telegram.

39:36.501 --> 39:38.369
You'll hear it soon.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.275
I hope that this doesn't
sound callous but

39:46.210 --> 39:48.311
do you truly believe
they're still alive?

39:48.313 --> 39:50.614
I'm not gonna speculate
on that.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.884
There are limits to the
responsibilities

39:54.886 --> 39:56.620
of a town sheriff.

39:58.723 --> 40:01.258
- Riding out into the terri...
- Lorna. I'm going.

40:01.260 --> 40:02.592
There isn't an option.

40:03.927 --> 40:05.661
Let's not have words on this.

40:11.368 --> 40:12.935
Franklin...

40:18.442 --> 40:20.177
Please come back.

40:40.967 --> 40:42.334
Hey, Greg.

40:51.579 --> 40:54.847
Here. I got some fresh wilds.

41:05.426 --> 41:07.694
Oh, there's some
good people in trouble.

41:08.328 --> 41:10.696
And I got to do
what I can for 'em.

41:15.002 --> 41:16.569
So...

41:16.571 --> 41:17.736
I'll see you back here.

41:19.406 --> 41:20.873
They're way up high.

41:37.927 --> 41:39.560
Is that my wife's kit?

41:40.028 --> 41:41.194
It is.

41:41.461 --> 41:42.694
I'll carry it.

41:49.367 --> 41:51.634
If we don't find
Wallington's stock

41:51.636 --> 41:53.836
can your stallion carry
both you and Mrs. O'Dwyer?

41:53.838 --> 41:55.004
I'm carrying her.

41:55.338 --> 41:57.505
Good. Nick can ride
with me if he has to

41:57.507 --> 41:58.839
this animal's strong.

42:03.277 --> 42:05.544
Mr. O'Dwyer, I need
to say this to you

42:05.546 --> 42:07.613
and I don't want
you to get sore.

42:07.615 --> 42:09.715
We're making a five day
journey in three days.

42:09.717 --> 42:11.797
Ridin' long and sleepin'
the bare minimum.

42:12.184 --> 42:14.686
We need to take care of these
animals and ourselves.

42:14.688 --> 42:16.320
I ain't thinkin' about
myself right now.

42:16.322 --> 42:17.421
I know you're not

42:17.822 --> 42:19.456
which is why I'm puttin'
this to you direct.

42:19.458 --> 42:21.724
If our horses die
before we get there

42:21.726 --> 42:23.325
or we go into hostile territory

42:23.327 --> 42:26.462
weak and foggy with exhaustion,
we won't rescue anybody.

42:27.030 --> 42:29.197
The only advantage we have
over these cave dwellers

42:29.199 --> 42:32.267
is bein' smarter.
So, let's not lose that.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.068
It ain't gonna be easy makin'
camp while these savages...

42:35.070 --> 42:38.072
I know it won't. But we need
to keep ourselves collected.

42:38.074 --> 42:40.074
Well, it ain't gonna be easy.

42:41.576 --> 42:42.977
I got the dynamite.

42:43.178 --> 42:44.578
How many?

42:45.813 --> 42:47.013
Six.

42:47.015 --> 42:50.017
Now, that is not a
handsome horse.

42:50.019 --> 42:52.119
Come on, come on!

43:31.432 --> 43:32.798
Let me help you down.

43:33.432 --> 43:34.532
I can do it.

43:34.866 --> 43:36.132
Not gracefully.

43:44.642 --> 43:46.442
Pain is how your
body talks to you.

43:47.610 --> 43:49.044
You'd do well to listen to it.

43:55.451 --> 43:57.485
- Mr. O'Dwyer.
- Yeah?

43:58.820 --> 44:01.889
Are we gonna come across any
more ponds before dark?

44:02.891 --> 44:04.692
I don't know what's
west of here.

44:05.493 --> 44:08.028
No cattle trail or anything
else goes in that direction.

44:11.465 --> 44:12.799
Let's fill up here.

45:05.458 --> 45:07.025
That reminds me

45:07.027 --> 45:09.126
I forgot to pack the Yule tree.

45:11.395 --> 45:13.063
Are any of you somnambulists?

45:13.065 --> 45:14.297
That's private.

45:14.299 --> 45:15.531
He means sleepwalk.

45:15.533 --> 45:17.566
Oh. No, I don't.

45:18.134 --> 45:19.768
- Me neither.
- Nope.

45:21.003 --> 45:22.103
Good.

45:23.238 --> 45:25.039
Sleep with your guns nearby

45:25.640 --> 45:27.641
and shoot anything
that rings a bell.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.112
Could be an innocent
animal or somebody lost.

45:31.546 --> 45:33.079
Our horses are hobbled.

45:34.414 --> 45:36.816
Any animal that comes
at us is a predator.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.818
Any person that approaches
a camp in the dark

45:39.820 --> 45:43.555
without identifying himself
is a criminal or a savage.

45:44.924 --> 45:47.825
If you hear a jingle,
point your gun and shoot.

45:50.329 --> 45:51.595
I'll probably beat
you to the draw

45:51.597 --> 45:53.730
but don't count on
me to save you.

45:55.533 --> 45:57.099
Let it go.

45:59.168 --> 46:00.869
I can't.

46:00.871 --> 46:02.770
Hey, hey!

46:04.372 --> 46:06.539
You watch how you
speak to the law

46:06.541 --> 46:09.276
the sheriff especially.
You aren't the captain.

46:09.278 --> 46:10.677
No.

46:11.011 --> 46:12.578
But I'm the most
intelligent man here

46:12.580 --> 46:14.280
and I intend to keep us alive.

46:14.282 --> 46:16.483
You're the most intelligent
here. Is that a fact?

46:16.883 --> 46:18.183
It is.

46:19.019 --> 46:22.388
Sheriff Hunt has a wife,
so does Mr. O'Dwyer.

46:22.390 --> 46:24.189
And you're a widower.

46:24.191 --> 46:27.660
Yeah, what does that got
to do with anything?

46:28.128 --> 46:30.028
Smart men don't get married.

46:35.034 --> 46:36.100
Well...

46:37.703 --> 46:39.970
That's because no
woman would want you.

46:42.373 --> 46:44.474
Many women invite me
over for dessert.

46:46.243 --> 46:47.376
Eleven in Bright Hope.

46:47.877 --> 46:50.145
John, enough with
that kind of talk.

46:51.413 --> 46:52.780
Alright, cowboy.

47:05.929 --> 47:07.797
- You got enough?
- Oh, there's plenty.

47:07.799 --> 47:09.398
- Sure?
- Yeah.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.565
Blow on it first.

47:10.567 --> 47:11.965
Right. Yes, sir.

47:14.803 --> 47:16.370
Let us pray.

47:21.910 --> 47:24.979
Bless us, O Lord, and
these, thy gifts

47:32.020 --> 47:34.021
which we are about to receive

47:38.160 --> 47:39.927
from...

47:58.514 --> 48:00.348
When do we leave?

48:01.884 --> 48:03.517
I'll rouse everyone
when I wake up.

48:03.519 --> 48:05.720
I don't sleep more than
about four hours a night.

48:27.178 --> 48:28.478
Sheriff?

48:29.813 --> 48:31.247
Hmm?

48:31.982 --> 48:34.516
Can... Can you read a book
in the bath?

48:38.488 --> 48:40.208
I don't understand
what you're askin'.

48:40.889 --> 48:42.991
What I'm asking is,
can you sit in a bathtub

48:42.993 --> 48:45.659
full of hot water
and read a book?

48:47.395 --> 48:48.763
I've never tried.

48:49.197 --> 48:51.198
Well, I hear about people
doing it all the time

48:51.200 --> 48:53.500
but every time I try,
I ruin the book.

48:55.270 --> 48:58.971
I splash water on it or I get
it wet turning the pages.

48:59.672 --> 49:01.473
I've even dropped some in.

49:03.843 --> 49:05.276
Why are you so determined

49:05.278 --> 49:08.280
to read literature
while takin' a bath?

49:08.282 --> 49:09.814
Well, it's just...

49:10.348 --> 49:12.709
It's just nothing feels better
than sitting in that tub

49:13.918 --> 49:15.418
but it just gets
so dull looking

49:15.420 --> 49:16.919
at your toes all the time.

49:25.528 --> 49:27.829
Why don't you get
a music stand?

49:29.364 --> 49:32.699
Like the kind an orchestra
fellow uses or the choirmaster?

49:34.435 --> 49:36.102
Now that's an idea.

49:37.271 --> 49:41.206
You put your book on that.
Right next to the tub.

49:42.408 --> 49:44.910
Keep a towel near, so you can...

49:44.912 --> 49:46.244
You can dry your fingers,

49:46.246 --> 49:48.206
you know, before you
turn the pages.

49:50.215 --> 49:52.983
First thing I'm gonna
do when I get back

49:52.985 --> 49:55.106
is I'm gonna go get me
one of those stands.

50:02.560 --> 50:03.626
Hey!

50:04.961 --> 50:08.097
I bet you Mr. Brooder couldn't
have thought of that solution.

50:08.099 --> 50:09.698
Good night, old man.

50:10.332 --> 50:11.398
Good night.

51:12.062 --> 51:14.697
Here is the official opinion
of the backup deputy

51:14.699 --> 51:16.498
of Mr. O'Dwyer's behavior.

51:16.500 --> 51:18.099
Suspicious.

51:18.801 --> 51:21.235
He's got a lot on his mind.

51:28.376 --> 51:30.210
Could I borrow the German?

51:30.845 --> 51:32.712
If you broke it, would
you go to Hamburg

51:32.714 --> 51:33.879
and purchase a replacement?

51:33.881 --> 51:35.580
Oh, of course I would.

51:35.582 --> 51:37.449
Peter loved schnitzel.

51:39.185 --> 51:40.951
I'll look myself.

51:43.689 --> 51:45.322
What do you see?

51:47.258 --> 51:50.894
A snake in a tree.

51:52.029 --> 51:53.595
What kind?

51:55.732 --> 51:56.832
Deceased.

52:47.222 --> 52:50.791
Oh, Jesus, goddamn!

52:56.430 --> 52:57.830
Sorry.

53:39.044 --> 53:43.281
Damn, damn, damn!

54:07.241 --> 54:08.474
You know when?

54:08.476 --> 54:09.808
Yes, sir.

54:10.843 --> 54:14.112
Brooder,
don't step in the middle.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.313
I shan't.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.353
How's the leg?

54:23.355 --> 54:24.722
Swollen.

54:25.256 --> 54:26.823
Any signs of infection?

54:26.825 --> 54:28.324
I don't think so.

54:29.592 --> 54:32.261
Chicory should look at it
tonight when we've camped.

54:32.263 --> 54:33.929
He did some surgery in the war.

54:34.330 --> 54:35.830
I'll mind it myself.

54:36.866 --> 54:38.600
With that tincture of opium?

54:41.870 --> 54:44.906
You went through my things?
My wife's possessions?

54:45.374 --> 54:47.294
- I did.
- Well, you shouldn't have!

54:47.775 --> 54:49.543
Give it back,
you dumb imbecile!

54:49.545 --> 54:52.212
Don't hurl insults at Chicory,
he's followin' orders.

54:52.214 --> 54:53.413
Now give over that bottle.

54:53.415 --> 54:54.681
It ain't yours to claim.

54:55.249 --> 54:57.683
If you use that stuff,
you'll spill from the saddle.

54:57.685 --> 54:59.645
I'm tryin' to prevent
that accident.

55:04.023 --> 55:05.790
I ain't had any.

55:06.359 --> 55:09.126
I apologize for goin'
in your wife's things.

55:10.194 --> 55:11.527
Will you yield it?

55:25.744 --> 55:28.178
Mr. O'Dwyer rides vanguard.

55:37.756 --> 55:39.289
Mr. Kory.

55:39.823 --> 55:41.223
Call me Chicory.

55:42.726 --> 55:44.359
Chicory...

55:45.961 --> 55:47.795
I'm sorry for hollerin' at you.

55:49.064 --> 55:51.799
My wife used to call me a
dumb imbecile all the time.

55:51.801 --> 55:53.467
Felt kinda nice.

56:04.446 --> 56:05.813
Brooder...

56:06.615 --> 56:09.350
Take a look with the German.
We need to put in soon.

56:09.352 --> 56:11.185
I'll make a survey.

56:11.187 --> 56:13.321
- Sheriff.
- Old man?

56:13.323 --> 56:15.756
You know, I know that the
world's supposed to be round

56:15.758 --> 56:18.760
but I'm not so sure
about this part.

56:47.660 --> 56:49.461
He's all the way empty.

56:53.232 --> 56:57.135
You think that infection
could turn to gangrene?

56:59.838 --> 57:01.873
It could go either way.

57:03.976 --> 57:06.445
Have you ever performed
an amputation?

57:06.913 --> 57:08.113
Yeah.

57:08.314 --> 57:09.547
In the war.

57:10.982 --> 57:13.284
But even done correctly

57:14.486 --> 57:15.953
chances aren't good.

57:16.754 --> 57:19.156
That seems like an
especially miserable way

57:19.158 --> 57:21.257
to spend your final days.

57:24.094 --> 57:25.595
The worst.

57:33.337 --> 57:34.769
Relax, gentleman, relax.

57:35.103 --> 57:37.405
Don't be scared. I am a friend.

57:37.407 --> 57:38.606
You aren't.

57:39.507 --> 57:41.541
You're a stranger and a sneak.

57:41.543 --> 57:43.210
I was about to announce myself.

57:43.212 --> 57:44.972
Strike a match so we
can see you clear

57:45.045 --> 57:47.946
or we'll light things up with
our guns. Mind our backs.

57:47.948 --> 57:49.481
One moment,<i> por favor.</i>

57:51.884 --> 57:53.951
My name's Ramiro.

57:53.953 --> 57:55.787
You got any <i> companeros?</i>

57:55.789 --> 57:57.522
I have an associate.

57:57.524 --> 57:59.290
Tell him to strike a match.

57:59.292 --> 58:00.825
Do what they ask.

58:08.233 --> 58:10.033
- Just him?
- Just him.

58:10.035 --> 58:13.303
If we see any others lurkin'
around, we'll execute you.

58:13.305 --> 58:15.605
I speak the truth. I was
going to announce myself...

58:15.607 --> 58:17.340
Be quiet and toss your guns.

58:23.081 --> 58:24.781
My associate is unarmed.

58:25.249 --> 58:28.551
Come forward.
Don't drop those matches.

58:33.924 --> 58:35.804
See if you can
salvage the fire.

58:39.461 --> 58:40.727
Damn you!

58:52.407 --> 58:54.642
Deputy, hold.

59:02.351 --> 59:03.884
Holster your gun.

59:05.152 --> 59:07.320
You had no cause.

59:07.322 --> 59:09.821
Those men were scouts
for a raiding party.

59:11.290 --> 59:13.492
- Or thieves.
- You don't know that.

59:14.627 --> 59:17.128
And I wanted to get information
from 'em in any case.

59:17.130 --> 59:18.630
They wouldn't have told
you the correct year

59:18.632 --> 59:19.998
much less anything else.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.833
I know how to
interrogate a man.

59:21.835 --> 59:23.568
He's got a system.

59:24.270 --> 59:26.704
We need to pack up and make
a cold camp somewhere else

59:26.706 --> 59:28.739
some place defensible.

59:29.841 --> 59:33.010
If you want to question
my morals, do it later.

59:39.484 --> 59:41.217
There aren't any to question.

59:43.888 --> 59:45.788
What transpired?

59:51.395 --> 59:53.195
Mr. Brooder

59:53.963 --> 59:56.432
just educated two Mexicans

59:56.833 --> 59:58.867
on the meaning of
manifest destiny.

01:00:01.137 --> 01:00:02.770
They deserve it?

01:00:03.905 --> 01:00:05.772
I don't know.

01:00:07.008 --> 01:00:08.375
Are we breakin' camp?

01:00:10.478 --> 01:00:13.581
No, you go back to sleep.
I'll wake you when we're...

01:00:13.848 --> 01:00:15.582
Unless you want to eat dinner.

01:00:15.584 --> 01:00:18.485
Here, we saved some for you.
Pork and beans.

01:00:19.353 --> 01:00:20.653
Thank you.

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:54.925
Well, were they armed?

01:00:56.127 --> 01:00:57.494
Sort of.

01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:00.697
What time is it?

01:01:02.433 --> 01:01:06.470
It's about nine, but it
feels like next week.

01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:26.725
I see a spot.
Shielded on one side.

01:01:26.727 --> 01:01:27.959
Good enough.

01:01:48.016 --> 01:01:50.083
You shouldn't have
shot those Mexicans.

01:01:54.188 --> 01:01:55.488
You hear me, Brooder?

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:56.922
It was wrong.

01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:59.590
Go to sleep, ol' timer.

01:02:01.527 --> 01:02:03.447
One of 'em was
wearing a crucifix.

01:02:03.628 --> 01:02:05.308
Then Jesus should've
helped them.

01:02:05.629 --> 01:02:08.264
You shouldn't call for
the Lord's attention right now.

01:02:09.266 --> 01:02:10.866
I'm not overly concerned.

01:02:10.868 --> 01:02:12.101
Quiet!

01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:15.569
We need to sleep
every minute we can.

01:02:17.505 --> 01:02:19.206
The situation is bad
enough already.

01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:21.274
Well, he was wrong... Deputy!

01:02:21.276 --> 01:02:22.942
Yes, sir.

01:02:41.863 --> 01:02:43.897
Ambush!

01:02:49.503 --> 01:02:51.103
Blast!

01:02:52.205 --> 01:02:54.439
They got the horses!

01:02:56.675 --> 01:02:58.208
Save your bullets.

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:00.077
They're beyond.

01:03:00.812 --> 01:03:02.892
I don't understand
how they got them all.

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:06.249
Saucy would never allow
some greaser on her back.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.884
You trained her in bigotry?

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:12.087
She's smart and she's loyal.

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:16.824
John...

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:22.430
Looks like she resisted.

01:03:52.565 --> 01:03:53.965
I'm coming.

01:04:21.564 --> 01:04:23.664
Thank you for your services.

01:04:39.748 --> 01:04:42.217
We need to compact our gear
and bury the remainder.

01:04:42.484 --> 01:04:46.319
If we sleep, it should be
in hot daylight, not now.

01:04:48.089 --> 01:04:52.258
Mr. O'Dwyer, that valley is
at least a two day walk...

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:53.559
I'll try to match your pace.

01:04:53.928 --> 01:04:56.089
If I fall behind,
I'll catch up when you sleep.

01:05:03.604 --> 01:05:04.704
Alright.

01:05:05.873 --> 01:05:08.840
Brooder, compact your
gear to the essentials.

01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:10.607
I shall.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:12.842
Sorry about Saucy.

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:16.211
Yes, sir. She was top quality.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.580
Thank you.

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.953
We'll carry your stuff.

01:05:27.188 --> 01:05:30.457
Go on, get ahead of us.

01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:37.230
When you pack, don't
forget her medical kit.

01:05:37.731 --> 01:05:38.964
We won't.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:57.684
You watch the terrain now.

01:05:57.686 --> 01:06:00.921
One bad fall, you
could lose that leg.

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:21.309
Watch out for those brigands.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.593
Over in Mississippi,
Nadine and I

01:06:36.595 --> 01:06:39.095
saw a cripple on
crutches, with one leg

01:06:39.097 --> 01:06:40.429
race a normal man and win.

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:44.367
He took these huge strides

01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:48.271
kind of a back and forth
motion like a pendulum.

01:06:48.273 --> 01:06:51.840
He's uncommonly hasty, yeah.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.544
It isn't the same
with a hurt leg.

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:01.016
I was just pointing
out the possibilities.

01:08:14.499 --> 01:08:16.198
Mr. O'Dwyer!

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.037
Are you well?

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.372
I'm fine!

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.292
I wonder if Peter will
enjoy Mexican food.

01:08:46.596 --> 01:08:48.599
I imagine he'll like <i> tamales.</i>

01:08:51.703 --> 01:08:53.624
If somebody gives
him a hot pepper

01:08:54.104 --> 01:08:55.805
they'll get a hoof in the face.

01:08:57.006 --> 01:08:58.573
Aren't you tired?

01:08:59.075 --> 01:09:01.710
Oh, no! Out on the plain here

01:09:01.712 --> 01:09:03.631
just pretending to
be a pack mule.

01:09:05.013 --> 01:09:07.582
That in no way affects the
endeavors of your mouth?

01:09:07.584 --> 01:09:10.518
Well, would you prefer the

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.322
sound of trudging footsteps
and men breathing?

01:09:15.924 --> 01:09:17.591
That makes it worse.

01:09:18.026 --> 01:09:19.292
Ah!

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:28.134
Just keep on. I'll catch up.

01:09:28.136 --> 01:09:29.536
You sure?

01:09:29.537 --> 01:09:30.870
I don't have a choice.

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:35.220
Just mark the route with
four stones every so often.

01:09:39.145 --> 01:09:40.545
We will.

01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:41.613
Here.

01:09:42.548 --> 01:09:44.982
You take this if
you're gonna trail.

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.319
We'll use Brooder's German.

01:10:00.934 --> 01:10:02.301
I believe Peter

01:10:02.303 --> 01:10:04.369
will learn to appreciate
Mexican women.

01:10:05.137 --> 01:10:07.038
I'm starting to
envy that horse.

01:11:39.843 --> 01:11:41.410
It's Arthur O'Dwyer!

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.747
I'm comin' into camp!

01:11:46.116 --> 01:11:48.852
We won't shoot,
almost certainly.

01:11:58.129 --> 01:11:59.497
Mind the trip line.

01:12:05.804 --> 01:12:07.724
We've been here a
couple of hours.

01:12:07.872 --> 01:12:09.672
We're leavin' at twilight.

01:12:10.874 --> 01:12:12.275
Wake me then.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:45.744
Time to go.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.481
Oh, Mr. Brooder...

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.752
Mr. Brooder found a pond and
we filled your canteens.

01:12:53.754 --> 01:12:57.455
And, we put some provisions
in your squirrel bag.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:00.358
Lots of things with
food energy like

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.460
cheese and nuts and
some beef cobs.

01:13:02.462 --> 01:13:03.594
I appreciate it.

01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:08.332
- Mr. O'Dwyer.
- Sheriff?

01:13:08.334 --> 01:13:09.866
We'll mark our route
with the four rocks

01:13:09.868 --> 01:13:11.033
so you can see it.

01:13:12.503 --> 01:13:14.170
No, no...

01:13:14.804 --> 01:13:18.107
I'm comin' with you.

01:13:20.343 --> 01:13:22.576
Follow after at your own pace.

01:13:24.513 --> 01:13:26.473
If we get there
before you catch up,

01:13:27.482 --> 01:13:30.517
I'll try to refrain from
flirting with Mrs. O'Dwyer.

01:13:32.786 --> 01:13:35.219
God!

01:13:36.855 --> 01:13:39.056
Don't you talk that
way about my wife!

01:13:39.058 --> 01:13:40.290
I know you had designs!

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:42.192
That was years ago.

01:13:42.194 --> 01:13:43.893
And she refused me.

01:13:44.494 --> 01:13:46.928
And now I'm out here risking
my life for both of you

01:13:47.563 --> 01:13:50.464
perhaps that entitles me to
an occasional innuendo.

01:13:50.466 --> 01:13:53.401
Well, it doesn't!
She's my whole everything

01:13:53.403 --> 01:13:55.369
and those savages
have got her and...

01:13:55.970 --> 01:14:00.607
God knows what they're doing
to her and every second

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:04.242
that we delay, we...

01:14:06.879 --> 01:14:08.445
Remove yourself.

01:14:10.581 --> 01:14:11.748
Damnation.

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:16.551
God!

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.426
Will you unearth
my medical kit?

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:33.802
Hold still. Let me examine you.

01:14:50.222 --> 01:14:51.455
How bad?

01:14:52.723 --> 01:14:54.491
Mr. O'Dwyer,

01:14:55.192 --> 01:14:56.759
you're stayin' behind.

01:14:57.427 --> 01:14:59.362
No, I'm comin' with you.

01:14:59.364 --> 01:15:01.430
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

01:15:03.433 --> 01:15:05.200
You go and get me
back my crutch.

01:15:05.202 --> 01:15:08.070
That leg can't be disregarded.
Now you're stayin' put.

01:15:08.072 --> 01:15:09.604
To hell with your authority

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:10.705
and the way you've
been doin' things!

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:13.208
You shouldn't have shot that
drifter back in Bright Hope

01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:14.175
and got my wife involved.

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:16.243
And Brooder shouldn't have
executed them Mexicans

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.611
and made it all worse.

01:15:20.481 --> 01:15:22.081
I can't honestly say I know

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:23.804
which way it would've
gone with the Mexicans

01:15:23.917 --> 01:15:25.984
or if I had left
that drifter go.

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:29.053
But this is where we are.

01:15:32.591 --> 01:15:34.291
You can't go anywhere
on that leg.

01:15:34.293 --> 01:15:35.559
It needs to be operated on.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.060
Mr. O'Dwyer.

01:15:39.796 --> 01:15:41.297
Look at it.

01:15:49.239 --> 01:15:51.039
Chicory's gonna...

01:15:51.407 --> 01:15:53.409
He's gonna have
to take that leg.

01:15:54.811 --> 01:15:56.678
No, no, no...

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.113
If we don't gangrene
will set in and...

01:15:59.115 --> 01:16:01.783
No, you can't, no, this
is my choice, not yours!

01:16:01.785 --> 01:16:03.117
And I'm saying no! No!

01:16:03.119 --> 01:16:04.251
No.

01:16:06.121 --> 01:16:07.754
No.

01:16:17.265 --> 01:16:18.665
Can you set it?

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:21.900
I can set it.

01:16:26.539 --> 01:16:28.439
If that's your
choice, so be it.

01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:38.483
Will you leave some
stones so I can follow?

01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:40.685
In case something
happens to you.

01:16:42.288 --> 01:16:43.387
I'll mark the route.

01:16:45.823 --> 01:16:47.391
Thank you.

01:16:54.132 --> 01:16:56.466
Just give me enough
so you can operate.

01:16:56.468 --> 01:16:58.388
I don't wanna wake
up next month.

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:01.783
And take the rest in
case my wife needs it

01:17:02.805 --> 01:17:04.405
or Deputy Nick.

01:17:08.076 --> 01:17:09.643
I'll put some in a whisky flask

01:17:09.645 --> 01:17:12.046
and I'll leave the
remainder for you.

01:17:12.313 --> 01:17:14.647
But you don't take more
than a spoonful a day.

01:17:22.256 --> 01:17:25.425
I don't know if I'll
be awake when you go

01:17:25.427 --> 01:17:28.161
so I want to apologize to you
now for gettin' hot at you.

01:17:28.595 --> 01:17:30.930
I don't lose my
temper most times.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:32.764
We know you don't.

01:17:32.766 --> 01:17:34.006
Don't concern yourself over it.

01:17:34.232 --> 01:17:36.193
I thought it made
things interesting.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.003
I appreciate what
you are doin'.

01:17:40.271 --> 01:17:42.152
Don't think
I ain't appreciative.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:44.341
Just please keep her safe.

01:17:45.576 --> 01:17:48.512
We won't leave without
Mrs. O'Dwyer in our care.

01:17:51.716 --> 01:17:52.816
Feel the medicine?

01:17:53.118 --> 01:17:54.852
My hands got tingles.

01:17:57.922 --> 01:17:59.022
Lean back.

01:18:07.299 --> 01:18:08.932
Put your head right there.

01:18:10.634 --> 01:18:12.369
Brace him.

01:18:25.751 --> 01:18:27.618
The tincture will help

01:18:29.822 --> 01:18:31.322
but this is gonna penetrate.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.669
So long, cowboy.

01:18:53.846 --> 01:18:55.346
Will he survive?

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.547
Oh, he has a chance.

01:19:17.672 --> 01:19:18.837
You hear that?

01:19:22.541 --> 01:19:23.775
What are you hearing?

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:28.546
It stopped.
Just wait a second...

01:19:33.317 --> 01:19:35.117
I thought I was imagining that.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.020
Oh, I am fairly certain
I heard that sound

01:19:39.022 --> 01:19:41.590
back in Bright Hope, on the
night of the kidnapping.

01:19:43.225 --> 01:19:44.758
It feels like a signal.

01:19:47.062 --> 01:19:48.462
Maybe an alarm.

01:19:52.332 --> 01:19:55.134
Inspect your firearms.
We've been spotted.

01:20:04.643 --> 01:20:07.679
It is the official opinion
of the backup deputy

01:20:07.681 --> 01:20:10.481
that leaving a trail of rocks
is a job for the backup deputy.

01:20:10.483 --> 01:20:12.383
I told him I'd do it.

01:20:14.987 --> 01:20:16.419
Was that it?

01:20:17.221 --> 01:20:18.287
Yes.

01:20:20.657 --> 01:20:22.824
Sounds further than before.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.460
Maybe they're frightened?

01:20:25.661 --> 01:20:27.762
Of us? No.

01:20:45.182 --> 01:20:46.983
How many of them did you kill?

01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:55.858
They were all, what do you
call 'em, warriors and braves?

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.959
Mostly.

01:20:57.794 --> 01:20:59.629
Oh, some weren't braves?

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:02.164
Some weren't men.

01:21:06.469 --> 01:21:07.702
Oh.

01:21:08.403 --> 01:21:10.404
An Indian woman is
still an Indian.

01:21:10.406 --> 01:21:11.739
She knows how to use a bow and

01:21:11.741 --> 01:21:13.840
a spear, and so do
her children.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:17.844
Why do you hate them so much?

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.681
You should ask my
mother and my sisters.

01:21:23.383 --> 01:21:24.783
I never met 'em.

01:21:24.785 --> 01:21:27.485
That's correct. You never did.

01:21:30.089 --> 01:21:31.322
Oh.

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:33.657
Indians got them, huh?

01:21:33.659 --> 01:21:35.725
Let him alone, old man.

01:21:37.794 --> 01:21:40.328
A thing like that makes a
considerable impression

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.897
upon a ten-year old boy.

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:47.549
I'm awfully sorry for
what happened to them

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:49.804
but I don't think

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:52.572
I could ever kill a woman
or a child,

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.215
- not even...
- Deputy.

01:21:55.242 --> 01:21:58.043
Is it possible for you
to close that aperture?

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.176
Do you see it?

01:22:28.178 --> 01:22:29.511
I see several.

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:33.680
Can you tell which one's the
Valley of the Starving Men?

01:22:34.448 --> 01:22:35.749
I cannot.

01:22:39.619 --> 01:22:41.554
Oh, you trust me
with the German?

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.255
I've seen you operate.

01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:46.691
Oh, I...

01:22:56.303 --> 01:22:59.305
- Oh, my Lord!
- What?

01:23:02.242 --> 01:23:03.942
- Oh!
- What?

01:23:04.643 --> 01:23:07.479
Oh, I wish I had this with
me when I went to the rodeo.

01:23:08.314 --> 01:23:10.434
- The clarity and...
- Do you see the valleys?

01:23:12.017 --> 01:23:13.751
I see a few of them.

01:23:15.353 --> 01:23:16.720
They all look the same.

01:23:18.090 --> 01:23:20.891
May Sheriff Hunt
try the German?

01:23:20.893 --> 01:23:22.459
He may.

01:23:28.566 --> 01:23:31.635
I think we should start
with the nearest one.

01:23:33.237 --> 01:23:35.005
I'll take the vanguard.

01:23:35.873 --> 01:23:38.193
One of you two should monitor
the rear with the German.

01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:49.119
If you see anything
or hear anything

01:23:50.754 --> 01:23:53.789
point it out for us
before you shoot.

01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:55.256
I shall.

01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:57.957
As long as it doesn't
forfeit my opportunity.

01:23:57.959 --> 01:24:01.528
Brooder, we're here for a
rescue, not a massacre.

01:24:15.377 --> 01:24:16.610
Horse tracks.

01:24:17.379 --> 01:24:19.213
Mr. Wallington's or ours?

01:24:20.481 --> 01:24:23.550
See if you can find a set where
one horse, a smaller one

01:24:23.918 --> 01:24:25.818
is missing a hind shoe.

01:24:26.319 --> 01:24:27.819
Right here.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.155
Think that's Clarence's colt?

01:24:30.157 --> 01:24:31.289
Almost certainly.

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:32.923
It means we change direction.

01:24:32.925 --> 01:24:34.565
- Here we go.
- Yeah.

01:25:02.857 --> 01:25:06.093
Tracks to your west
lead to it. Their flaw.

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.200
So, this is it?

01:26:36.895 --> 01:26:39.296
I'll signal once I've
made a determination.

01:26:39.463 --> 01:26:41.998
If you haven't heard from
me in 30 seconds,

01:26:42.632 --> 01:26:43.698
go.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.499
What's the signal?

01:28:07.658 --> 01:28:09.492
You see any activity in there?

01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:30.378
Chicory.

01:28:31.213 --> 01:28:32.279
Tie this off.

01:28:42.091 --> 01:28:43.624
I need the repeater.

01:29:00.042 --> 01:29:02.610
Supply me with dynamite and

01:29:02.612 --> 01:29:05.013
don't return until
I've used it.

01:29:09.717 --> 01:29:11.838
I am far too vain
to ever live as a cripple.

01:29:16.523 --> 01:29:18.124
This is my spot.

01:29:23.631 --> 01:29:25.531
I'd like a cigar.

01:29:45.654 --> 01:29:47.389
The answer to your question

01:29:48.491 --> 01:29:50.558
is 116.

01:29:53.896 --> 01:29:56.130
You killed a 116 Indians, huh?

01:30:03.973 --> 01:30:05.808
Goodbye, Mr. Brooder.

01:30:09.312 --> 01:30:11.847
We'll make sure
all this has value.

01:30:12.415 --> 01:30:13.748
Please do.

01:30:14.449 --> 01:30:16.751
I shall kill as many as I can.

01:31:14.077 --> 01:31:15.510
We need to get...

01:33:07.102 --> 01:33:09.570
Sheriff Hunt? Mr. Kory?

01:33:10.138 --> 01:33:11.439
Mrs. O'Dwyer, are yo...

01:33:12.174 --> 01:33:13.607
Go in or they'll kill you.

01:33:16.478 --> 01:33:17.711
Go!

01:33:42.738 --> 01:33:44.471
Mrs. O'Dwyer...

01:33:47.242 --> 01:33:48.976
Are you hurt?

01:33:48.978 --> 01:33:50.410
I'm alive.

01:33:53.581 --> 01:33:55.447
Is Nick with you?

01:33:58.351 --> 01:33:59.918
He's not well.

01:34:00.986 --> 01:34:02.252
And the drifter?

01:34:03.153 --> 01:34:04.921
They ate him.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.760
No, not him.

01:34:32.683 --> 01:34:33.916
We're in hell.

01:34:48.533 --> 01:34:50.033
Don't take him!

01:34:50.035 --> 01:34:51.868
Nick! Wake up!

01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:54.137
Don't do this.
Don't do this. Please!

01:34:55.939 --> 01:34:58.675
Nick! Wake up!

01:35:03.547 --> 01:35:05.315
God damn it, Nick! Wake up!

01:35:07.618 --> 01:35:09.284
Damn savages.

01:35:11.454 --> 01:35:13.054
Come on, old man!

01:35:13.056 --> 01:35:15.289
We've gotta break through here.
Come on!

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.793
Push!

01:35:20.294 --> 01:35:23.297
Harder! Harder, old man!

01:35:27.667 --> 01:35:31.137
Chicory, tie it off.

01:35:34.642 --> 01:35:36.209
Sheriff Hunt, are you there?

01:35:38.145 --> 01:35:39.879
I'm here, Nick. I'm right here.

01:35:41.182 --> 01:35:43.483
You were right about
that drifter.

01:35:43.485 --> 01:35:45.051
He killed a lot of people.

01:35:45.252 --> 01:35:47.087
He butchered them
in their sleep

01:35:47.089 --> 01:35:49.255
and he robbed them.
His name was Purvis.

01:35:49.923 --> 01:35:53.259
And then he desecrated the
burial ground of these things.

01:35:53.261 --> 01:35:55.221
These Indians or
whatever they are.

01:35:55.794 --> 01:35:57.554
He raved about it
all in the end.

01:35:59.031 --> 01:36:00.731
Thanks for telling me.

01:36:01.599 --> 01:36:03.600
That man deserved to die.

01:36:04.703 --> 01:36:05.869
Alright.

01:36:07.838 --> 01:36:10.207
Will you send my possessions
back to Michigan?

01:36:10.209 --> 01:36:12.409
Most of that stuff
belonged to my brothers.

01:36:13.277 --> 01:36:14.343
I'll send it.

01:36:15.144 --> 01:36:16.344
Thank you.

01:36:20.049 --> 01:36:23.083
No, no, no...

01:36:38.966 --> 01:36:41.835
Nick, Nick, listen to me.
I want you to know

01:36:41.837 --> 01:36:44.204
that all these savages
are gonna be massacred.

01:36:44.738 --> 01:36:47.006
The cavalry is riding
right now from Gatesville.

01:36:48.009 --> 01:36:49.341
And they're gonna butcher

01:36:49.343 --> 01:36:52.077
every last one of these
godless beings.

01:37:37.896 --> 01:37:39.296
It ain't true then?

01:37:40.198 --> 01:37:41.531
What you said?

01:37:42.966 --> 01:37:44.166
What?

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.100
About the cavalry.

01:37:50.872 --> 01:37:52.506
No. It wasn't.

01:37:55.243 --> 01:37:57.611
Well, I thought it
might be possible

01:37:57.613 --> 01:38:00.114
that you had a
secret backup plan.

01:38:04.219 --> 01:38:05.619
I'm sorry, old man.

01:38:06.287 --> 01:38:08.220
Well, why did you say it?

01:38:10.257 --> 01:38:12.224
If they were doin' that to me

01:38:12.226 --> 01:38:14.186
it's the only thing
I'd want to hear.

01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:16.294
That you'd be avenged?

01:38:17.329 --> 01:38:18.862
What happened to my husband?

01:38:20.564 --> 01:38:21.830
Is he dead?

01:38:24.668 --> 01:38:26.135
He's alive.

01:38:29.839 --> 01:38:31.306
Arthur wouldn't
have allowed you

01:38:31.308 --> 01:38:33.268
to attempt this rescue
without him.

01:38:35.678 --> 01:38:39.313
He came along, but he
got injured a day ago.

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:42.516
He's... He's convalescing.

01:38:42.518 --> 01:38:45.685
But we...
We put a trail for him.

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.156
Why did you do that?

01:38:50.357 --> 01:38:52.726
- So he could follow us.
- Chicory!

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:54.260
Here?

01:38:54.861 --> 01:38:56.027
To this place?

01:38:59.365 --> 01:39:01.099
We didn't know
what it was like.

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:03.534
This is why frontier
life is so difficult.

01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:07.538
Not because of the
Indians or the elements

01:39:07.872 --> 01:39:09.706
but because of the idiots!

01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:14.244
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:39:14.645 --> 01:39:16.012
We're sorry.

01:39:16.014 --> 01:39:17.547
You are idiots!

01:39:21.952 --> 01:39:23.253
And Arthur's no better.

01:39:23.487 --> 01:39:25.648
I told him not to go up
on that roof, but he...

01:39:27.657 --> 01:39:30.192
I implored him not to
follow, but he's...

01:39:32.795 --> 01:39:36.998
He's determined. We need to do
what we can before he gets here

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.899
so he has a chance against them.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:41.535
We already killed two.

01:39:41.702 --> 01:39:43.969
- Brooder got one.
- Three then.

01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:46.371
Mrs. O'Dwyer,

01:39:49.074 --> 01:39:52.410
do you know how many
there are in this clan?

01:39:57.248 --> 01:39:58.782
Mrs. O'Dwyer?

01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:15.899
Twelve males, maybe more.

01:40:17.869 --> 01:40:21.638
And two pregnant females
who are blind cripples.

01:40:24.109 --> 01:40:25.609
Alright.

01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:34.452
Do you still have
that whisky flask?

01:40:38.056 --> 01:40:39.256
Yeah.

01:40:39.957 --> 01:40:41.124
Yeah.

01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.793
But it's got tincture in it.

01:40:45.861 --> 01:40:47.362
You have tincture of opium?

01:40:48.063 --> 01:40:49.363
We do.

01:40:52.735 --> 01:40:55.703
How many of them can we poison
with two fingers worth?

01:41:01.075 --> 01:41:03.810
Big James, check and see
if any calves went astray.

01:41:40.585 --> 01:41:42.719
Ah! Son of a bitch slope.

01:42:06.475 --> 01:42:07.842
You won't stop me.

01:42:35.308 --> 01:42:38.076
Son of a bitch tincture.

01:43:21.927 --> 01:43:24.929
You watchin'?
You seein' all this?

01:43:25.764 --> 01:43:27.885
This is what I've prayed
my whole life for.

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:30.500
For help right now.

01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:48.021
Sheriff.

01:44:51.793 --> 01:44:53.226
Just let me, just let
me have one drink.

01:44:53.228 --> 01:44:56.095
Just give me a little bit.
Give me a taste.

01:45:01.535 --> 01:45:03.035
Alright, here.

01:45:12.179 --> 01:45:13.712
No, no...

01:45:18.985 --> 01:45:20.118
Drink it.

01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:34.621
It got to taste
better than people.

01:45:46.713 --> 01:45:47.946
Damnation.

01:46:04.032 --> 01:46:05.932
The one with the wolf skull
will lose consciousness

01:46:05.934 --> 01:46:09.000
for a long period of time,
but may live.

01:46:10.036 --> 01:46:13.038
The second one will die and

01:46:13.572 --> 01:46:15.532
the third one will
not be affected.

01:46:15.974 --> 01:46:18.308
- Alright.
- Well, two more is respectable.

01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:23.179
So my husband will have to
face seven of them, at least.

01:46:23.914 --> 01:46:26.115
Including the one
with the boar tusks.

01:46:26.316 --> 01:46:29.886
Well, Arthur O'Dwyer is
a very determined man.

01:46:34.725 --> 01:46:36.058
And crippled.

01:48:02.719 --> 01:48:04.320
Is that jewelry?

01:48:38.726 --> 01:48:40.359
Goddamn abomination.

01:50:09.894 --> 01:50:11.594
This is where it capsized.

01:50:29.147 --> 01:50:30.380
Back way.

01:52:21.702 --> 01:52:23.002
You seein' this?

01:52:36.518 --> 01:52:37.918
Mrs. O'Dwyer?

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.221
Yes?

01:52:40.622 --> 01:52:42.923
Have you eaten anything
since they took you?

01:52:44.191 --> 01:52:45.458
A little.

01:52:46.193 --> 01:52:48.294
If it's been more
than a couple of days

01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:53.098
you should try to eat some
of that bird they gave you.

01:52:53.866 --> 01:52:55.132
Why?

01:52:56.534 --> 01:52:58.435
Your body needs sustenance.

01:53:01.872 --> 01:53:03.833
They wouldn't want
us to grow lean.

01:53:14.851 --> 01:53:18.620
I've been thinking a lot
about that flea circus.

01:53:19.054 --> 01:53:21.456
Remember the one that had
come in to Bright Hope?

01:53:22.357 --> 01:53:24.791
- I remember.
- Did you go?

01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:28.128
I wasn't able to.

01:53:28.362 --> 01:53:30.162
I went with Nadine.

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:32.897
It was run by these
two European men.

01:53:32.899 --> 01:53:36.835
They were brothers,
possibly identical twins

01:53:36.837 --> 01:53:39.471
but one was a foot taller
than the other,

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.607
that might disqualify them.

01:53:43.742 --> 01:53:46.143
But I don't remember
their name.

01:53:47.879 --> 01:53:49.246
The Sanderson's.

01:53:53.018 --> 01:53:54.351
Did you see it?

01:53:55.219 --> 01:53:57.119
Arthur wanted to go.

01:53:57.888 --> 01:54:01.289
Oh, I don't know what
your opinion is, but

01:54:01.957 --> 01:54:03.925
my wife said it
was all a trick.

01:54:04.526 --> 01:54:07.528
Even when those brothers gave
us those magnifying glasses

01:54:07.530 --> 01:54:11.866
and we saw those fleas pull
that little stagecoach

01:54:11.868 --> 01:54:15.937
right into the depot
or roll those cannons,

01:54:15.939 --> 01:54:18.939
those tiny little cannons
onto the battlefield.

01:54:20.908 --> 01:54:23.210
She said those fleas are dead.

01:54:23.911 --> 01:54:26.245
They're just glued to some
mechanical contraption,

01:54:26.247 --> 01:54:28.615
you know, that moves on its own

01:54:28.617 --> 01:54:30.717
like a timepiece

01:54:31.752 --> 01:54:33.185
or a windup.

01:54:35.956 --> 01:54:39.258
Still, I thought it was
real and I told her,

01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:42.395
I said, "Don't talk so loud.
The performers will hear you."

01:54:43.063 --> 01:54:45.465
Because I don't know what
kind of hearing fleas have

01:54:46.066 --> 01:54:47.966
or if they can sense
kindness in a voice

01:54:47.968 --> 01:54:49.467
the way a dog can.

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.009
They drink dog's blood,
so maybe.

01:55:06.518 --> 01:55:08.151
I think it was real.

01:55:09.787 --> 01:55:13.523
I believe those fleas
were alive and talented.

01:55:18.696 --> 01:55:21.665
Most flea circuses
employ tricks

01:55:22.166 --> 01:55:25.334
but the Sanderson's use
real living fleas.

01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:30.239
I knew it was authentic!
I just felt it.

01:55:37.781 --> 01:55:40.517
Thank you, thank you
for verifying that.

01:55:42.052 --> 01:55:43.519
You're welcome.

01:56:15.856 --> 01:56:17.356
I think they figured it out.

01:56:17.358 --> 01:56:18.557
Appears so.

01:56:45.685 --> 01:56:47.085
Sheriff!

01:56:47.087 --> 01:56:48.352
Wake up!

01:56:49.721 --> 01:56:52.256
Wake up! Sheriff!

01:56:59.031 --> 01:57:00.297
Sheriff, get up, get up!

01:57:08.538 --> 01:57:11.574
I'll make sure you're avenged!
I'll make sure!

01:57:11.576 --> 01:57:13.576
Sheriff, I'll make sure
you're avenged.

01:57:14.043 --> 01:57:15.677
I will. I'll make sure.

01:57:29.125 --> 01:57:32.060
That dumb imbecile,
he doesn't know how to reload!

01:57:48.078 --> 01:57:49.344
Uh-oh.

01:58:05.527 --> 01:58:07.794
Arthur!
There's one in here wi...

01:58:53.042 --> 01:58:54.375
Arthur!

01:59:13.662 --> 01:59:15.229
How many did you get?

01:59:17.165 --> 01:59:18.498
Three others.

01:59:19.099 --> 01:59:23.769
Then there are three more,
at least somewhere.

01:59:25.071 --> 01:59:26.237
Brooder?

01:59:26.239 --> 01:59:27.471
Gone.

01:59:30.241 --> 01:59:31.908
You gonna make it, Sheriff?

01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:34.143
No.

01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:38.579
You positive?

01:59:38.913 --> 01:59:40.180
I am.

01:59:41.515 --> 01:59:42.648
Deputy.

01:59:43.249 --> 01:59:44.515
Yes, sir?

01:59:45.951 --> 01:59:47.418
I'm stayin' here.

01:59:48.086 --> 01:59:50.287
I intend to finish
off the males

01:59:50.289 --> 01:59:52.390
since they know
about Bright Hope.

01:59:52.392 --> 01:59:53.758
I want you to

01:59:54.893 --> 01:59:56.660
escort the O'Dwyer's home.

01:59:57.295 --> 02:00:00.330
Make sure they get there safe.

02:00:00.764 --> 02:00:02.164
Yes, sir.

02:00:02.632 --> 02:00:04.233
How's your leg?

02:00:04.235 --> 02:00:06.368
Help Chicory. Sheriff...

02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:11.607
Anything I can do for you?

02:00:12.442 --> 02:00:15.344
Put that repeater in my hand.

02:00:24.954 --> 02:00:28.324
Go out the way you came in.
Don't dawdle.

02:00:39.003 --> 02:00:40.570
Thank you.

02:00:41.305 --> 02:00:42.738
Mrs. O'Dwyer.

02:00:59.855 --> 02:01:01.822
Have a talk with Mr. O'Dwyer.

02:01:03.792 --> 02:01:05.025
Yes, sir.

02:01:05.459 --> 02:01:08.561
It is the official opinion
of the backup deputy

02:01:09.096 --> 02:01:12.832
that a talk with him
is a good idea.

02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:17.937
Say goodbye to my wife.

02:01:21.675 --> 02:01:23.274
I'll say hello to yours.

02:01:26.011 --> 02:01:27.245
Yes, sir.

02:02:08.853 --> 02:02:10.087
Let's keep going.

02:03:37.353 --> 02:03:38.653
Are you alright?

02:03:39.956 --> 02:03:41.222
Yeah.

02:03:47.096 --> 02:03:49.397
I'd love a proper kiss, but

02:03:49.598 --> 02:03:51.919
those things that you've
been putting in your mouth...

02:04:03.147 --> 02:04:04.667
- Good?
- Yeah.

02:04:10.552 --> 02:04:11.919
Were those gunshots?

02:04:12.387 --> 02:04:13.520
They were.

02:04:23.465 --> 02:04:24.631
Let's go.

02:04:25.366 --> 02:04:28.736
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah. Come on.
