Oh, it's them!
Maybe they loved my essay.

It doesn't work
quite that quick, Sue.

to me?

15:38.350 --> 15:40.296
I know I'm the only thing in
the house that brings you joy,

Oh!

15:44.917 --> 15:47.367
Thank you so much!

See, we're on our way to take
our oldest to college.

He's going to
East Indiana State.

15:50.901 --> 15:52.907

But thanks, anyway.

It smells fine, Brick.

they didn't even read it.

Where's he going?

18:27.741 --> 18:29.242
I thought we would
swing by the bookstore

18:29.375 --> 18:32.128
and let him pick out a t-shirt
and take him to dinner.

to try new things.
