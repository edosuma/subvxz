'See that?

00:13.673 --> 00:16.673
'That's what's going to kill everyone

00:16.793 --> 00:18.793
'any second now.

00:18.953 --> 00:22.633
'It doesn't matter who you are,
who you pray to,

'Yeah, it's Judgment Day.

'The actual apocalypse.

'And where am I?

00:35.273 --> 00:36.633
'In Slough.

00:36.793 --> 00:40.513
'Or rather, under Slough,
watching it on telly.'

00:40.633 --> 00:42.393
One minute now.

00:42.553 --> 00:45.233
One minute. These pictures
coming live to us from Hubble.

'I know what you're thinking.

00:47.073 --> 00:49.073
'Cheer up,
you're one of the lucky ones!

'I mean, have you seen
who else is in here?

'Are we the future of mankind?

01:04.766 --> 01:06.767
'I mean, seriously?!'

01:06.927 --> 01:09.807
The human race
united as never before.

01:09.967 --> 01:14.927
It's time to brace ourselves
to say goodbye.

01:18.456 --> 01:20.576
Thank you all for watching.
I hope we'll meet again.

01:52.617 --> 01:54.617
Hey, lovely.

01:54.737 --> 01:57.017
Message 2,610.

01:59.057 --> 02:01.377
It's my birthday. Yay!

02:02.697 --> 02:05.217
Seventh one without you.

02:05.337 --> 02:07.857
And it's not getting any easier.

02:08.017 --> 02:11.217
I thought it would,
but nothing changes.

02:13.017 --> 02:14.097
I still miss you...

02:15.497 --> 02:17.217
..as much as I did on day one.

02:19.737 --> 02:21.897
So, usual stuff -

02:22.057 --> 02:24.657
if you're out there,
give me a sign.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.937
Anything. Just...

02:27.057 --> 02:28.817
a little birthday present.

02:40.777 --> 02:43.417
Blimey, you're up early.
I haven't been to bed yet.

02:43.577 --> 02:46.457
But good news, I am now officially
a Level 3 Warlock.

02:46.577 --> 02:47.817
All right!

02:47.977 --> 02:50.417
Good to hear the career
is going well.

02:50.577 --> 02:52.537
Aren't you tired of having
exactly the same thing

02:52.607 --> 02:55.007
cooked for exactly the same
amount of time every morning?

02:55.127 --> 02:57.527
No. And by the way, it's Tuesday.

02:57.687 --> 03:00.447
No, don't sigh, just pay the rent.

03:00.607 --> 03:02.807
'I spend too much of my life
having this conversation.

03:02.867 --> 03:05.307
'So set up a direct debit.
Yeah, but then I'd be on the grid.

03:05.327 --> 03:07.007
'What grid?!'

03:07.167 --> 03:09.327
Let's do a little experiment,
shall we? Let's not.

03:09.447 --> 03:11.607
What happens if I do this?

03:11.767 --> 03:13.727
Oh, no, he's out of
his comfort zone.

03:13.887 --> 03:17.287
Heart pounding, palms clammy.
Embrace it, this is therapy.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.527
Embrace the chaos.

03:18.687 --> 03:20.927
Good news,
I'm also timing it on my watch.

03:21.047 --> 03:22.447
So there!

03:22.567 --> 03:24.807
Hmm? I... Ah!

03:24.967 --> 03:28.167
Is this you teaching me
to embrace the chaos?

03:28.287 --> 03:30.007
You've burnt your mouth, haven't you?

03:30.167 --> 03:32.767
Seriously, Jamie,
these routines are killing you.

03:32.927 --> 03:35.407
You need to get some life
back in your life.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.927
Noob! Noob!

03:41.087 --> 03:44.607
Be careful where you look, yeah?
Don't look 'em in the eye.

03:44.727 --> 03:46.607
In here, it's a sign of aggression.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.447
You're in a world of pain, noob.

03:50.287 --> 03:51.687
Ignore 'em, just walk.

03:51.847 --> 03:55.447
Noob! Noob! Noob! Noob!

03:59.527 --> 04:01.567
Deep breaths.

04:01.687 --> 04:02.967
Deep breaths.

04:03.087 --> 04:05.967
Noob! Noob! Noob! Noob!

04:10.687 --> 04:12.767
Welcome to the neighbourhood, noob.

04:12.887 --> 04:15.407
She's fine, got dibs on that!

04:15.567 --> 04:18.087
Going to rope it,
soap it and grope it.

04:18.207 --> 04:19.767
This is temporary.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.927
No, no, I mean it. I'm going to
get bailed out any second.

04:23.047 --> 04:24.127
My lawyer's working on it.

04:24.187 --> 04:26.467
So you'll come and get me
as soon as it's posted, right?

04:26.487 --> 04:28.767
I put a mint on your pillow. Enjoy.

04:41.327 --> 04:42.327
OK.

04:43.647 --> 04:46.087
OK, don't panic. Don't panic.

04:47.447 --> 04:48.767
Hey, noob, over here.

04:50.327 --> 04:52.047
It's OK, don't be scared.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.727
What's your name, noob?

04:55.687 --> 04:56.687
Rhonda.

04:56.807 --> 05:00.007
Rhonda, that's a nice name.

05:00.127 --> 05:01.727
Fuck you, Rhonda.

05:01.847 --> 05:03.087
Where's my money?

05:03.247 --> 05:06.567
See, this ring's for the Latinas.
You pay rent, bitch.

05:06.687 --> 05:08.967
Hey, why don't you leave her be?

05:09.127 --> 05:11.607
This don't concern you.
It's between me and the noob.

05:11.727 --> 05:13.327
I said, leave her alone

05:13.487 --> 05:16.687
or else you and me is going to have
a little problem, sweetheart.

05:19.967 --> 05:22.087
Hey, Rhonda, I'm Leanne.

05:22.207 --> 05:24.487
Girl, I seen you on the TV.

05:24.607 --> 05:26.927
You are quite the celebrity.

05:27.047 --> 05:29.047
You OK in there, hon?

05:29.167 --> 05:30.607
Uh, not really.

05:30.767 --> 05:33.807
Now, don't you worry about
them girls.

05:33.927 --> 05:36.367
You're going to be just fine.

05:36.527 --> 05:41.007
You're with me now and I ain't going
to let nothing bad happen to you.

05:41.167 --> 05:44.967
Thank you. Well, it is my pleasure,
hon.

05:45.087 --> 05:47.407
What are friends for?

05:57.407 --> 06:01.247
Et benedictus fructus ventris tui

06:01.367 --> 06:04.687
Ave Maria, gratia plena

06:04.807 --> 06:07.327
Dominus tecum

06:07.447 --> 06:11.207
Benedicta tu in mulieribus

06:11.327 --> 06:15.647
Et benedictus fructus ventris tui

07:52.852 --> 07:56.532
Ah, you must be the new
work experience. Gavin, is it?

07:56.744 --> 07:57.744
Welcome aboard.

08:01.663 --> 08:03.663
So, interested in banking, are we?

08:03.823 --> 08:06.863
Nah, I sent my form back late.
All the good stuff had gone.

08:06.983 --> 08:08.063
Oh, I see.

08:08.223 --> 08:10.503
'Well, any questions -
don't be shy. Just ask.

08:10.663 --> 08:12.663
'So, you're one of
them fat cats then?'

08:12.783 --> 08:14.223
One of the wankers that screwed us?

08:14.343 --> 08:15.623
Well, what do you think?

08:15.743 --> 08:17.903
Nah, you'd be better dressed.

08:18.023 --> 08:19.183
Good.

08:19.303 --> 08:20.503
Any other questions?

08:20.623 --> 08:23.823
Yeah, got a hug for your mum?!

08:23.943 --> 08:25.423
Oh!

08:27.063 --> 08:30.543
Mum, this is Gavin.
Gavin, my mum.

08:30.663 --> 08:31.663
Loser.

08:36.903 --> 08:39.743
Mum, I can't drink.
I'm at work.

08:39.863 --> 08:40.943
Nonsense.

08:41.102 --> 08:45.103
I've got one child and I am going to
help him celebrate his birthday.

08:45.263 --> 08:48.743
Plus, I just finished being
on nights for a week. So, cheers.

08:50.303 --> 08:52.663
Christ, I'm losing the will to live.

08:55.503 --> 08:58.583
Sod it, we're not learning anything.
Let's do this.

09:00.423 --> 09:03.743
Here you are! Happy birthday,
darling. Thanks, Mum.

09:07.263 --> 09:10.023
A subscription to
an online dating website.

09:10.143 --> 09:11.783
Mum, we've been through this!

09:11.903 --> 09:13.703
You've got to move on, Jamie.

09:13.823 --> 09:15.463
I don't want to move on.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.623
You're like that woman in the book.

09:18.783 --> 09:20.703
You might have to narrow
that down a little bit.

09:20.823 --> 09:23.143
You know the one, the cobwebby one.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.423
Spider-Woman?

09:24.543 --> 09:26.143
No, from the old days.

09:26.263 --> 09:28.943
Um... Oh...thingy!

09:29.103 --> 09:30.983
I've actually
got some work to do.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.023
Havisham.

09:32.143 --> 09:34.703
Miss Havisham - Great Expectations.

09:34.823 --> 09:36.623
Jilted at the altar.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.143
I wasn't jilted at the altar.

09:38.303 --> 09:40.183
Spent years
moping around the house

09:40.343 --> 09:43.623
wearing her wedding dress -
frozen in time.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.463
But you're still young, Jamie.
PHONE RINGS

09:46.623 --> 09:48.343
Yeah? You've got to stop
acting like

09:48.463 --> 09:49.943
your best days are behind you. Who?

09:50.103 --> 09:52.023
It isn't healthy.
Well, what do they want?

09:52.183 --> 09:55.943
Life throws stuff at you.
I'll be there in a minute.

09:56.103 --> 09:59.223
Sometimes it's bad
but sometimes it's really good.

10:01.463 --> 10:05.583
It's been seven years, Jamie.
Time to let go.

10:05.743 --> 10:08.663
And did you ever stop to think
that maybe I like my rut?

10:08.783 --> 10:11.143
Maybe I like having a routine?

10:11.303 --> 10:13.743
I don't want any more surprises
in my life.

10:13.903 --> 10:16.903
I like knowing exactly
what's going to happen next.

10:17.023 --> 10:18.943
Shut it, shit mouth.

10:19.063 --> 10:20.663
Jamie Winton, I'm arresting you

10:20.823 --> 10:23.863
on 484 separate charges
of bank robbery,

10:24.023 --> 10:26.383
identity theft
and international cyberterrorism.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.263
What?! Jamie,
what the hell's going on?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.643
You don't have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

10:30.703 --> 10:33.843
if you don't mention when questioned
something which you later rely on in court.

10:33.903 --> 10:36.823
No, no, no, there's been a mistake.
That's what they all say.

10:36.983 --> 10:39.463
Oh, this is way cooler
than I thought it was going to be.

10:49.103 --> 10:51.463
Hurry up, Sister Celine.

10:51.623 --> 10:54.783
Please don't doddle,
I'm a very busy man.

10:54.943 --> 10:56.983
Sorry, I have done
the whole touristy bit

10:57.143 --> 10:59.463
but I have never been
behind the scene before.

10:59.623 --> 11:01.863
I feel like Dorothy
in The Wizard Of Oz,

11:01.983 --> 11:03.503
when she looked behind the curtain.

11:03.623 --> 11:05.543
A somewhat inappropriate analogy.

11:05.663 --> 11:09.103
There is an actual Devil's Advocate?

11:09.263 --> 11:13.023
You did read the job description
before applying, didn't you?

11:13.183 --> 11:15.263
Father Jude will be with you
in due course.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.743
Take a seat.

11:18.863 --> 11:19.903
And good luck.

11:57.503 --> 12:00.903
Is it me or did she just
look me in the eye?

12:01.063 --> 12:04.503
I just came to say hello,
why you got to be so aggressive?

12:04.623 --> 12:07.343
I-I-I wasn't, I swear.

12:07.503 --> 12:10.183
I don't have any money,
I can't pay you.

12:10.303 --> 12:12.783
No money and an attitude?

12:12.943 --> 12:15.543
Puts us in an awkward position,
don't it?

12:15.703 --> 12:19.863
Oh, now see, I thought
I told you to leave her alone.

12:19.983 --> 12:22.023
These ladies bothering you, hon?

12:22.143 --> 12:23.423
Oh, Jesus.

12:23.583 --> 12:26.543
Oh, please don't take
the Lord's name in vain, sweet pea.

12:26.703 --> 12:30.463
Now, like I said,
Rhonda is with me.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.943
That true, noob? You klanning up?

12:34.183 --> 12:37.743
Well, don't be shy now,
Rhonda, I thought we was friends.

12:39.783 --> 12:42.903
OK, I'm going to say this
real nice and slow,

12:43.063 --> 12:46.463
because I know that English
ain't your strong point.

12:46.623 --> 12:50.263
Why don't you,
and the rest of the donkey fuckers,

12:50.383 --> 12:52.663
go and take a siesta.

12:52.823 --> 12:57.263
You think that's acceptable, noob?
That kind of racial slurring?

12:57.423 --> 13:00.423
Ain't no slurring occurring,
just stating facts.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.263
I'd rather fuck a donkey
than fuck my own brother.

13:03.423 --> 13:07.903
Oh, now, see, that is racial,
starting in on the inbreeding jibes.

13:08.063 --> 13:10.903
I mean, how come you ain't
chastising her, huh?

13:11.023 --> 13:13.063
Oh, what, you on their side now?

13:13.223 --> 13:15.263
Hey, noob, we don't want you
on our team.

13:15.383 --> 13:17.663
It ain't like on the outside, hon.

13:17.783 --> 13:20.423
In here, you're white - end of.

13:20.583 --> 13:22.823
You ain't with us,
you ain't with no-one.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.783
Oh, no, time to pick!

13:26.903 --> 13:28.463
Um...

13:32.223 --> 13:34.223
McNeil, your lawyer's here.

13:37.063 --> 13:38.263
Let's go.

13:38.383 --> 13:39.383
Oh, that's a shame!

13:39.543 --> 13:42.023
Because it looks like
I'm out of here. But...

13:44.503 --> 13:45.783
..for the record,

13:45.903 --> 13:48.223
I would have chosen this for you.

13:49.983 --> 13:52.423
Oh, but don't worry,
I've got one for you, too. What?!

13:55.143 --> 13:57.143
Bye!

13:57.303 --> 14:01.663
What do you know about the group
calling themselves Deus Ex Machina?

14:01.823 --> 14:04.383
Nothing,
just what's been on the news.

14:04.503 --> 14:07.223
They're hackers, or anarchists.

14:07.383 --> 14:09.743
I don't know,
they seem to hate everything.

14:09.863 --> 14:11.743
And what's your connection to them?

14:11.863 --> 14:13.743
I don't have one.

14:13.903 --> 14:16.103
I want you to take a look
at their calling card.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.463
What does this word mean to you?

14:21.063 --> 14:22.183
Nothing, it is gibberish.

14:22.303 --> 14:24.663
And what about if I do...

14:24.783 --> 14:25.823
this?

14:26.943 --> 14:28.383
No, still nothing.

14:28.543 --> 14:31.263
Revelations -
chapter six, verses 1-2.

14:31.423 --> 14:34.863
"And I saw when the lamb opened
one of the seven seals,

14:35.023 --> 14:38.023
"and I heard one of
the four living creatures saying,

14:38.143 --> 14:39.903
"as with the voice of thunder,

14:40.023 --> 14:44.303
"'Come and behold, a white horse.'"

14:44.463 --> 14:46.423
And how is this relevant
to my client?

14:46.583 --> 14:49.583
No-one knows the real identity
of the leader of Deus Ex,

14:49.743 --> 14:54.023
but online, he goes by
the username TheWhiteHorse.

14:54.183 --> 14:56.463
Would you like
to see a photo of him?

15:01.823 --> 15:03.103
Remind you of anyone?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.343
Pricks!

15:13.583 --> 15:15.063
Who the fuck are you?

15:15.223 --> 15:18.223
Sister Celine.
I am here for the interview.

15:18.343 --> 15:21.423
Oh, yes, the researcher job.

15:21.543 --> 15:23.823
Please. Bear with me.

15:25.663 --> 15:29.223
Sister Celine... Sister Celine?

15:29.343 --> 15:31.183
Sorry about my language, by the way.

15:31.303 --> 15:33.263
Oh, it's OK, I speak English.

15:35.623 --> 15:37.183
I meant my potty mouth -

15:37.303 --> 15:39.023
my swearing. Did it offend you?

15:39.183 --> 15:43.063
It surprised me a little but, no, it
does not offend.

15:43.183 --> 15:44.263
Let me ask you,

15:44.423 --> 15:48.583
do you find the phrase
"Christ on a bike" offensive?

15:48.743 --> 15:51.343
Because I just used it in a meeting
and you would have thought

15:51.503 --> 15:53.823
that I'd performed an abortion
on the table or something.

15:53.983 --> 15:57.143
Well, I suppose the image
of Christ riding a bicycle

15:57.303 --> 15:59.303
could seem a little bit
disrespectful.

15:59.423 --> 16:00.983
Really?

16:01.143 --> 16:03.703
Because I think he'd be
very likely to ride a bike.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.543
He seems like that
kind of a guy to me.

16:06.703 --> 16:09.823
What else would he show up in,
a stretch Hummer?

16:09.943 --> 16:12.543
No, it's not here.

16:12.703 --> 16:14.423
Father Alphonse,

16:14.583 --> 16:17.143
could you please bring in
Sister Celine's file?

16:20.423 --> 16:24.023
So, tell me what you know
about the Devil's Advocate.

16:24.143 --> 16:25.823
Honestly, nothing.

16:25.983 --> 16:28.983
I thought it was a figure of speech
until I saw your door.

16:30.263 --> 16:34.103
I should not admit that.
I never had a job interview before.

16:34.263 --> 16:37.703
Right, in that case
I will treat you to the full spiel.

16:37.863 --> 16:40.503
When they want
to make someone a saint,

16:40.663 --> 16:42.663
they have to prove that
they led a good life

16:42.783 --> 16:44.423
and that there are two miracles

16:44.583 --> 16:46.823
that can be attributed to them
since they died.

16:46.983 --> 16:48.583
My job is to prove
that they felt up kids

16:48.703 --> 16:50.223
and parked in the handicap spaces,

16:50.383 --> 16:52.743
and that the two miracles
are bullshit.

16:52.863 --> 16:54.703
It's basically quality control.

16:54.863 --> 16:57.183
And it's worked very well
for 400 years,

16:57.343 --> 17:01.343
until old JP II abolished the office
in the '80s,

17:01.463 --> 17:03.063
and then what do you think happened?

17:03.183 --> 17:04.742
Eh... We made more saints?

17:04.863 --> 17:06.223
Exactly.

17:06.383 --> 17:08.782
We have canonised more people
in the past five years

17:08.903 --> 17:11.423
than in the entire 19th century.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.383
So, they have reinstated the office
and here I am...

17:15.742 --> 17:18.502
..the ecclesiastical turd
in the swimming pool.

17:19.983 --> 17:21.663
And I need help.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.423
I need someone tenacious,
with a clear head and thick skin,

17:24.542 --> 17:26.423
because we will not be popular.

17:28.783 --> 17:31.903
Do you have doubts,
Celine, about your faith?

17:32.023 --> 17:33.103
Yes.

17:33.263 --> 17:36.143
Good, there is no faith
without doubt.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.663
Next question. Do you smoke?

17:39.903 --> 17:41.783
Have you ever tried?

17:41.943 --> 17:43.903
Then how do you know
you won't like it?

17:45.103 --> 17:47.823
It's so good
to see a friendly face!

17:47.983 --> 17:51.063
You have no idea... OK,
here's the thing.

17:51.183 --> 17:52.903
We may have a slight problem.

17:53.983 --> 17:55.583
But I'm making bail, right?

17:55.743 --> 17:58.023
You said if I cooperated
I'd make bail.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.103
I know.

17:59.263 --> 18:01.183
You said you could keep me
out of jail.

18:01.303 --> 18:02.823
You said community service -

18:02.983 --> 18:05.023
picking up trash
on the side of the road.

18:05.143 --> 18:08.343
You said those things.

18:08.503 --> 18:11.863
I'm a librarian.
I can't survive in here!

18:11.983 --> 18:15.743
There's gangs. There's murderers.

18:15.863 --> 18:17.183
There's a...

18:18.783 --> 18:22.143
There's a woman who ate someone.

18:22.263 --> 18:25.783
Rhonda, I am doing everything I can.

18:25.943 --> 18:30.223
But I just met with the prosecutor
and he's playing hardball.

18:31.423 --> 18:34.903
I don't understand.
He is refusing to plea bargain.

18:35.063 --> 18:38.663
They're making an example of you,
to deter others.

18:40.143 --> 18:44.023
The charge stands at treason.
He is seeking five to ten.

18:46.303 --> 18:47.903
Months, right?

18:48.023 --> 18:49.343
Years.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.423
But nothing was stolen!
Nothing leaked.

18:55.543 --> 18:57.863
They don't care, Rhonda.

18:57.983 --> 19:00.543
Look at me, what is a black hat?

19:00.663 --> 19:02.823
What's VPN pivoting?

19:02.943 --> 19:04.783
SQL injecting?

19:04.903 --> 19:06.383
What's a rootkit?

19:06.503 --> 19:08.463
Rhonda, what's PowerPoint?

19:09.663 --> 19:14.183
You really expect me
to believe that you hacked the NSA,

19:14.343 --> 19:18.303
that you got past the toughest
cybersecurity on Earth?

19:18.423 --> 19:19.783
Yeah!

19:19.903 --> 19:22.743
Rhonda, help me to help you, please!

19:24.263 --> 19:28.463
Look, I know you're
covering for your son.

19:28.623 --> 19:31.263
And that's very noble,
but it's very misguided.

19:31.383 --> 19:33.183
They're throwing the book at you

19:33.343 --> 19:35.943
and they can't throw it very hard
at a 14-year-old.

19:36.063 --> 19:37.263
I know it was Spike.

19:42.903 --> 19:43.983
It was me.

19:44.103 --> 19:45.743
All me.

19:45.863 --> 19:48.783
OK, well, there's one more thing.

19:48.903 --> 19:50.023
In your absence,

19:50.183 --> 19:52.263
the court awarded custody of your son
to his father,

19:52.383 --> 19:55.103
his biological father.

19:55.263 --> 19:58.983
No, that man has done nothing
for my son his whole life!

19:59.103 --> 20:01.703
My husband is Spike's dad.

20:01.823 --> 20:03.183
But your husband is very ill.

20:03.343 --> 20:06.543
He's in no state to take care
of a minor and you're in here.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.063
That's time.

20:08.223 --> 20:10.743
No, wait, please.
OK, you have to get me out of here!

20:10.943 --> 20:14.543
I know, Rhonda, I am trying
all I can. Just stay safe.

20:16.303 --> 20:18.583
Don't do anything dumb.

20:18.703 --> 20:20.823
Don't antagonise anyone.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.831
Hey, did you hear about
that poor cow in the States,

20:34.951 --> 20:36.231
the librarian?

20:36.251 --> 20:38.531
Somehow she hacks the NSA, right?

20:38.533 --> 20:42.373
20 minutes she's in the system -
stole nothing, leaked nothing.

20:42.623 --> 20:45.703
She faces five to ten years
on principle.

20:45.823 --> 20:47.683
Where are you going with this?

20:47.683 --> 20:50.523
Well, Deus Ex hacked the White House
and the Pentagon.

20:50.643 --> 20:52.603
They leaked thousands of files.

20:52.723 --> 20:54.363
If they did that to her,

20:54.523 --> 20:57.203
just imagine what the Americans
are going to do to you

20:57.323 --> 20:58.523
when you're extradited.

20:58.683 --> 21:01.083
But it's not me.
Yeah, except that it is.

21:01.203 --> 21:03.603
And I can prove it. How?

21:03.763 --> 21:08.003
Six weeks ago, Interpol learned
that TheWhiteHorse was in Moscow.

21:08.123 --> 21:09.163
They just missed him

21:09.323 --> 21:13.283
but they did manage to get some DNA
of a wine glass that he used.

21:13.403 --> 21:15.883
And guess who came up as a match.

21:16.003 --> 21:18.603
I've never been to Moscow!

21:18.763 --> 21:21.883
And yet your DNA has.
How do you explain that, Professor?

21:23.603 --> 21:26.403
I don't suppose there's any chance
that you have a twin?

21:26.523 --> 21:28.083
No.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.563
Oh, bugger,
that really would have helped.

21:31.963 --> 21:33.843
Hello?

21:34.003 --> 21:37.563
Spike, honey, it's me.
Mom, are you OK? I'm fine,

21:37.683 --> 21:38.923
it's all fine.

21:39.083 --> 21:43.083
Don't you worry.
The people here are...lovely.

21:43.243 --> 21:46.323
It should be me in there, not you.
Honey, remember that talk we had.

21:46.483 --> 21:49.123
It's all gone to shit anyway,
Mom. They're taking me away.

21:49.283 --> 21:52.403
But it's only temporary.
I'm getting out soon, I promise.

21:53.563 --> 21:54.803
It's all going to be OK.

21:56.603 --> 21:58.963
I know you don't know
your real dad but...

21:59.083 --> 22:00.603
he's not so bad.

22:00.723 --> 22:02.483
You always said he was an asshole.

22:02.603 --> 22:04.563
Well, yeah.

22:04.683 --> 22:06.203
But people change, you know?

22:06.363 --> 22:08.203
Did they tell you where
he's living now?

22:08.363 --> 22:10.803
These dicks don't tell me anything.
It's going to be fine.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.323
My lawyer's on it and...

22:13.443 --> 22:15.803
Oh, my money's running out.

22:15.963 --> 22:19.123
Listen to me,
I'm coming home. I promise.

22:19.283 --> 22:22.883
I love you so much. I...

22:36.403 --> 22:39.723
Hi, this is Rhonda McNeil,
can I speak with my husband, please?

22:39.883 --> 22:42.643
I'm afraid he's asleep right now.
The doctor wants him to rest.

22:42.763 --> 22:43.803
He had chemo this morning.

22:43.963 --> 22:46.323
I understand but
I really need to speak with him.

22:46.483 --> 22:48.963
I am sorry, it's not a good time.
Try him again tonight.

22:49.123 --> 22:52.283
No, I can't try tonight because
this is my last coin, see? I...

22:52.443 --> 22:55.443
About eight, OK? Thank you. No...

23:17.843 --> 23:18.963
Here you are.

23:19.123 --> 23:22.243
Let's find out all there is to know
about Sister Celine.

23:22.403 --> 23:25.763
Entered the convent
straight out of school and...

23:25.883 --> 23:28.083
been there ever since. And...

23:29.763 --> 23:31.643
That's it.

23:31.763 --> 23:34.163
Ooh, is this you?

23:34.283 --> 23:35.763
Oh, you were so fat!

23:37.123 --> 23:40.003
Yeah, well, now I get it.
Now it makes perfect sense.

23:40.123 --> 23:41.203
Bullied at school,

23:41.363 --> 23:43.763
you wanted the boys to look at you
and none of them did

23:43.923 --> 23:47.683
so you turned to the one man who
would always love you as you are.

23:47.803 --> 23:49.243
And look at you now.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.283
A decade of convent living
under your belt and,

23:54.403 --> 23:55.883
that belt has tightened.

23:57.243 --> 23:59.203
The boys look at you
now, don't they?

24:00.323 --> 24:03.403
And in your head is a voice saying,

24:03.523 --> 24:05.523
"Maybe I made a mistake.

24:05.643 --> 24:07.723
"I could have had someone.

24:07.843 --> 24:09.243
"Been loved.

24:09.363 --> 24:10.723
"Made love."

24:10.843 --> 24:12.643
And there is another voice, saying,

24:12.803 --> 24:15.803
"Don't be stupid,
this is your life.

24:15.923 --> 24:18.643
"Out there, you have nothing."

24:18.803 --> 24:21.283
And both of those voices are yours,
aren't they?

24:21.403 --> 24:23.763
Neither one is God's.

24:24.843 --> 24:27.803
So, is it faith keeping you with us

24:27.923 --> 24:29.043
or cowardice?

24:30.723 --> 24:33.203
And the waterworks!
How predictable.

24:33.323 --> 24:35.283
I'm just tired. I had a long week.

24:35.403 --> 24:37.683
Oh, too tired to defend yourself?

24:37.843 --> 24:41.363
Sister Celine - tenacity,
a thick skin.

24:43.203 --> 24:45.963
Look, you've never lived.

24:46.123 --> 24:48.723
How can you possibly have
any insight into human nature -

24:48.843 --> 24:50.443
the desperation that people feel,

24:50.603 --> 24:52.603
the lies that they tell
because of it?

24:52.763 --> 24:56.363
Have you ever been
hungry, addicted, broke?

24:56.483 --> 24:57.723
What, and you have?

24:57.843 --> 24:58.963
Yes.

25:00.363 --> 25:02.243
I've made mistakes
and I've learned from them.

25:02.363 --> 25:04.643
But you know nothing.

25:04.803 --> 25:08.083
This has been...
a profound waste of time.

25:19.483 --> 25:21.803
Another one bites the dust.

25:21.923 --> 25:23.003
I'm not surprised.

25:23.163 --> 25:26.843
I really can't see how
a woman could... Shut up.

25:32.403 --> 25:33.803
Come on.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.003
Come on!

25:40.243 --> 25:42.003
Sister Celine.

25:42.163 --> 25:44.083
Is there something
that you want to add?

25:48.363 --> 25:50.443
I would have been good at this job.

26:00.003 --> 26:02.003
Was that the best you could do?

26:02.163 --> 26:06.523
You think you can just rip me apart
to amuse yourself?

26:06.643 --> 26:08.003
Because I am easy target?

26:08.163 --> 26:11.923
My English is not so good but
I know the word for that - asshole.

26:12.043 --> 26:13.803
Oh, get back in your closet.

26:13.963 --> 26:17.683
As for you, the smoking,
the swearing, all such a pose.

26:17.803 --> 26:19.483
Like a child who needs attention.

26:19.643 --> 26:21.403
"Oh, look at me,
aren't I different?"

26:21.523 --> 26:22.603
But you are not.

26:22.723 --> 26:25.483
You think you are a rebel but
you're just another sad little man

26:25.603 --> 26:27.603
who touches his penis too much.

26:27.723 --> 26:30.323
That's better.

26:30.443 --> 26:32.923
I like it, it's spunky.

26:33.043 --> 26:34.323
When can you start?

26:36.323 --> 26:40.883
So that's it, you're just going to
go back to the convent?

26:41.003 --> 26:42.343
You don't want to see the world?

26:42.403 --> 26:44.363
Not with you, no.
I don't believe you.

26:44.523 --> 26:48.563
Look, I think you have backed
yourself into a corner.

26:48.683 --> 26:50.883
So think about it, pray on it.

26:52.683 --> 26:54.963
Why don't you see
what the big fella wants?

27:07.083 --> 27:09.003
I mean, you have met him, right?

27:09.163 --> 27:12.163
Does he seem like a criminal
mastermind to you? I mean, really?

27:12.323 --> 27:15.843
Can we just go through the dates?
Thursday the 9th, evening.

27:16.923 --> 27:18.843
Right, Thursday is bowling.

27:19.003 --> 27:21.323
We're in a league.
The 9th was...

27:21.483 --> 27:25.043
Ah, yeah, our famous victory
over the Bowling Stones.

27:25.203 --> 27:27.163
I do a ball-by-ball
tweet commentary,

27:27.283 --> 27:28.643
with, like, photos and...

27:30.683 --> 27:32.523
There's the old boy.

27:34.123 --> 27:35.803
So you'll vouch he was with you?

27:35.963 --> 27:38.123
Oh, don't just take my word for it,
ask the boys.

27:38.283 --> 27:41.723
Miami Tony, Jazz...
All right, I get the gist.

27:41.883 --> 27:43.963
Oh, by the way,
did you get a mugshot of him?

27:44.083 --> 27:45.503
If so, could I get a copy of that?

27:45.563 --> 27:47.523
Cos I'd love to get
some T-shirts made.

28:04.323 --> 28:08.723
See, now, I would not be standing
out here alone if I was you.

28:08.883 --> 28:12.203
Oh, yeah, don't tell me - this is
your special white power rail.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.963
You don't like me but I'm going to
tell you something anyway.

28:18.123 --> 28:22.043
In this place,
it is all about front.

28:22.203 --> 28:24.923
You act like a victim,
you will be a victim.

28:25.043 --> 28:28.043
You act like a crazy bitch...

28:28.203 --> 28:30.483
I mean, why do you think
I got this thing?

28:32.643 --> 28:35.883
So you're not
a white supremacist?

28:36.003 --> 28:37.283
No, I am,

28:37.443 --> 28:39.963
I just ain't dumb enough
to think this is a good look.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.963
You need to get into the VIF.

28:43.123 --> 28:45.523
It's the
Vulnerable Inmates Facility.

28:45.683 --> 28:49.523
It's a little bit less...
intense kind of experience.

28:49.643 --> 28:51.003
How do I get in there?

28:51.163 --> 28:54.243
The two most popular ways is
getting stabbed or getting pregnant.

28:54.363 --> 28:56.643
I don't want you to stab me.

28:56.763 --> 28:59.443
Girl, I ain't offering to stab you.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.843
I can get you pregnant, though.

29:02.003 --> 29:04.603
That's nine months in there,
just for starters.

29:04.763 --> 29:09.963
Plus, another 18 months
for tit feeding and baby bonding

29:10.083 --> 29:11.763
and whatnot.

29:11.923 --> 29:14.923
That's over two years of safety,
Rhonda.

29:16.683 --> 29:19.123
How are you going to
get me pregnant?

29:19.243 --> 29:21.243
I can get you semen.

29:21.403 --> 29:25.963
For the right price,
I can get you good, strong semen.

29:26.123 --> 29:30.043
You see, I got a little arrangement
for the importation of goods.

29:30.203 --> 29:33.483
My grammy comes and visits me
once a week

29:33.603 --> 29:35.443
and, I mean, they search her and all

29:35.563 --> 29:36.923
but they don't go up her ass

29:37.083 --> 29:39.763
on account of respect
for the elderly and all that crap.

29:39.883 --> 29:42.403
I get it. That's the scam, right?

29:43.683 --> 29:46.683
You beat people up and then
you offer them safety for a price?

29:46.803 --> 29:48.323
Just leave me alone.

29:48.443 --> 29:50.843
I didn't order that hit, hon!

29:51.003 --> 29:53.643
Oh, where are you going?
I was trying to help!

29:59.603 --> 30:03.283
Tell me about your wife, Jamie.
Tell me about Layla.

30:05.683 --> 30:08.083
Why? "Why?"

30:08.243 --> 30:10.283
Because this is an interrogation
and I'm asking you.

30:10.403 --> 30:11.843
She disappeared, right?

30:13.283 --> 30:17.123
We were at Heathrow, we'd just
flown back from our honeymoon.

30:17.243 --> 30:19.203
We'd been married for two weeks.

30:19.363 --> 30:22.083
I went to get the car,
she went to get coffee...

30:24.523 --> 30:28.323
..I drove around to pick her up
and she wasn't there.

30:31.043 --> 30:33.523
And I never found her.
She just disappeared.

30:33.643 --> 30:35.923
Christ.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.403
Gone, just like that, into thin air.

30:38.523 --> 30:40.363
Pfff. Is she alive? Is she dead?

30:40.483 --> 30:41.683
Seven years and no answers.

30:41.843 --> 30:43.963
I mean,
how do you move on from that?

30:44.083 --> 30:45.163
You don't.

30:45.283 --> 30:47.363
No, I saw those videos you made.

30:47.483 --> 30:49.243
Well, not all of them, obviously.

30:49.403 --> 30:51.523
There must have been about,
what, 2,000?

30:51.643 --> 30:53.203
I've got to hand it to you, though,

30:53.363 --> 30:55.683
I don't know why you are doing it
but as cover stories go,

30:55.803 --> 30:57.483
you are very thorough.

30:57.603 --> 30:58.643
I don't understand.

30:58.803 --> 31:00.683
No, that's what I'm saying,
neither do I.

31:00.803 --> 31:02.883
I mean, what sort of person

31:03.043 --> 31:06.883
pretends that his wife
has been missing for seven years?

31:08.003 --> 31:11.203
And the Oscar goes to...

31:11.323 --> 31:12.563
Jamie Winton.

31:15.203 --> 31:17.043
There she is, alive and well.

31:17.163 --> 31:19.083
Oh, and who's that with her?

31:23.599 --> 31:24.919
She's my wife!

31:26.613 --> 31:28.333
I have a right to know!

31:28.493 --> 31:30.373
Well, you broke him.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.214
Didn't learn much, though, did we?

31:32.373 --> 31:36.373
Except A, he's not acting,
and B, he's got a watertight alibi.

31:36.391 --> 31:38.031
It wasn't him in Moscow.

31:39.711 --> 31:41.111
Go on.

31:47.311 --> 31:50.431
OK, we're dropping the charges.
You're free to go. It's about time.

31:50.550 --> 31:52.590
Come on, Jamie, let's go.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.711
I'm not leaving.

31:53.871 --> 31:56.591
I want the photo and I want to know
everything you know

31:56.751 --> 31:59.031
about who she's with, cos
it isn't me.

31:59.191 --> 32:00.591
Give me the photo.
I'm sorry,

32:00.751 --> 32:03.231
but it's evidence
in an ongoing investigation.

32:03.391 --> 32:05.151
I am not at liberty
to discuss it with you.

32:05.311 --> 32:08.991
I have been looking for seven years.
I have a right to know!

32:09.111 --> 32:10.551
I am sorry, Jamie.

32:10.671 --> 32:12.551
Really, I am.

32:12.671 --> 32:15.151
Come on, Jamie, let's get you home.

32:20.831 --> 32:22.351
In other news,

32:22.511 --> 32:24.871
the Attorney General
provoked controversy today

32:25.031 --> 32:27.751
by confirming he would seek the
maximum sentence for Rhonda McNeil.

32:27.911 --> 32:30.431
Civil liberties groups
criticised the decision,

32:30.591 --> 32:33.511
arguing the punishment was
disproportionate to McNeil's crime.

32:33.671 --> 32:36.991
McNeil now faces five to ten years
in a maximum security prison,

32:37.111 --> 32:39.471
despite stealing nothing...

32:39.591 --> 32:41.591
Girl, you need to sack that stylist!

32:41.751 --> 32:43.751
Her lawyer said today
that McNeil would...

32:45.671 --> 32:47.031
Hold on one second.

32:49.351 --> 32:51.511
We are interrupting to go
live to the White House,

32:51.671 --> 32:54.151
for an emergency statement
from the president.

32:54.271 --> 32:55.871
My fellow Americans,

32:56.031 --> 32:58.271
three days ago
the Hubble space telescope

32:58.431 --> 33:02.191
detected an unusually large comet
in our solar system.

33:02.351 --> 33:05.271
Since then, scientists have been
working around the clock

33:05.391 --> 33:06.751
to plot its trajectory.

33:06.911 --> 33:09.311
The comet was first
identified in the 1980s

33:09.471 --> 33:11.711
and did not pose
any threat to Earth.

33:11.871 --> 33:14.951
However, it appears that
at some point in the last few weeks,

33:15.071 --> 33:16.431
in the light of the other...

33:16.551 --> 33:19.351
'Is this some kind of test, Lord?

33:19.511 --> 33:23.791
'If you want me to do the job,
why make me work with him?

33:23.911 --> 33:26.271
'Or is that the point?

33:26.431 --> 33:28.911
'Why did you have to
make this so difficult?

33:29.031 --> 33:31.271
'Just tell me, please.'

33:34.111 --> 33:37.271
Oh, thank God.
I've been worried sick!

33:37.391 --> 33:40.071
What the hell was all that about?

33:40.191 --> 33:42.471
Honestly, I wish I knew.

33:42.591 --> 33:44.671
So they've dropped the charges?

33:44.791 --> 33:45.751
Jamie?

33:47.311 --> 33:49.991
What is it, are you all right?
Layla's alive.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.231
Layla?

33:52.911 --> 33:54.591
What's Layla got to do with this?

33:54.711 --> 33:56.591
And it seems there's another me.

33:56.711 --> 33:58.471
What are you talking about?

33:58.631 --> 34:02.711
He looks just like me.
We've got the same DNA.

34:02.831 --> 34:05.711
Mum, what aren't you telling me?

34:09.231 --> 34:11.471
Oh, mate, turn on the TV.
Not now, Dave.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.391
No, now, you need to see this.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.150
The collision knocked
the comet off course

34:16.271 --> 34:17.991
and onto a new trajectory.

34:18.150 --> 34:20.351
It is with great sadness
that I must tell you

34:20.511 --> 34:23.871
that the comet is now on a direct
collision course with Earth.

34:25.351 --> 34:28.871
It will strike us
in just 34 days' time.

34:28.991 --> 34:31.630
The comet is eight miles wide and
will hit us travelling at a speed

34:31.791 --> 34:33.630
of approximately
27 miles per second.

34:33.831 --> 34:36.991
Current indications are that
it will impact Earth

34:37.150 --> 34:39.710
somewhere on the eastern Atlantic,
off the coast of Europe.

34:41.911 --> 34:44.391
'Just give me a sign

34:44.551 --> 34:46.871
'like you used to do
with the burning bushes.'

34:48.431 --> 34:50.670
'Something clear and unav...'

34:56.071 --> 34:58.511
They have checked
and rechecked their findings...

35:13.751 --> 35:16.271
..all the data
points to the same conclusion,

35:16.391 --> 35:19.591
that this will be an ELE -

35:19.711 --> 35:21.791
an Extinction Level Event.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.391
The burning bush.

35:23.511 --> 35:25.431
I would like to appeal for calm.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.751
The situation will not get easier
if we panic.

35:36.391 --> 35:38.751
I assure you,
the United States government

35:38.911 --> 35:42.111
is doing everything it possibly can
to affect the situation,

35:42.271 --> 35:44.711
and I will let you know
as soon as I have more information.

35:44.831 --> 35:46.071
Hey, are you watching this?

35:46.191 --> 35:47.551
Sit back down!

35:47.711 --> 35:50.431
Open the goddamn door,
I'm not going to die in this freezer!

35:50.591 --> 35:52.991
This is genuine,
this is not a hoax.

35:53.111 --> 35:56.231
We have just 34 days left.

35:56.351 --> 36:00.951
God, what do we do now?

36:01.071 --> 36:02.391
I don't know about you two

36:02.551 --> 36:05.031
but I am going to get
absolutely hammered.

36:05.191 --> 36:08.831
We can go to the weather here,
but...where's Jane?

36:08.951 --> 36:10.911
Has Jane gone?

36:11.031 --> 36:11.951
She's gone.

36:16.431 --> 36:18.831
You didn't answer my question.

36:18.951 --> 36:20.471
Do I have a twin?

36:21.711 --> 36:24.431
I don't know. Maybe.

36:24.551 --> 36:26.551
"Maybe"?!

36:26.671 --> 36:27.791
What do you mean, "maybe"?

36:30.431 --> 36:32.351
You're adopted, Jamie.

36:33.951 --> 36:37.271
You were found in a shoebox
in a car park.

36:37.391 --> 36:39.711
You were tiny, a few hours old.

36:39.871 --> 36:44.351
And I adopted you and I meant to
tell you, I promise I did.

36:44.511 --> 36:48.391
But it's just the older you got,
there just never seemed a good time.

36:50.111 --> 36:51.911
And this...

36:52.031 --> 36:54.591
This is a good time?!

36:54.751 --> 36:57.431
It is my birthday
and the world is ending.

36:58.871 --> 37:00.351
I'm sorry.

37:00.471 --> 37:03.631
Jamie, I'm sorry. Jamie!

37:30.711 --> 37:32.071
Hello?

37:46.031 --> 37:47.871
Where's that music coming from?

37:52.991 --> 37:57.351
OK, call for backup. Now!

37:58.591 --> 38:00.591
I can't, the line is dead.

38:00.711 --> 38:01.991
OK, screw this.

38:04.711 --> 38:06.711
Hey! Hey!

38:13.431 --> 38:14.951
Isn't it wonderful?

38:15.111 --> 38:18.511
He's coming, Sister!
He's actually coming!

38:19.831 --> 38:21.391
Celine!

38:21.551 --> 38:25.031
Every crackpot in the world is
about to come out of the woodwork

38:25.151 --> 38:27.311
and prey on the scared and the weak.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.591
Fake prophets,
bullshit miracles -

38:29.751 --> 38:31.751
the world needs sceptics
now more than ever.

38:31.871 --> 38:32.871
Are you in or out?

38:32.991 --> 38:33.911
In.

38:53.551 --> 38:55.191
Attention, prisoners,

38:55.351 --> 38:59.271
this facility is no longer under
the control of the authorities.

38:59.431 --> 39:02.071
Please take a moment to
locate your nearest exit,

39:02.191 --> 39:04.631
then run, my pretties, run.

39:14.311 --> 39:16.151
I just found out I'm adopted.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.831
OK, and?

39:17.991 --> 39:20.311
So it's possible I have a twin
I didn't know about.

39:20.431 --> 39:21.871
I could maybe lead you to him.

39:22.031 --> 39:24.871
I could say I want to meet
and wear a wire or something.

39:25.031 --> 39:28.351
You finding him
is my best chance of finding her.

39:28.511 --> 39:30.991
Please, let me help
with your investigation!

39:31.111 --> 39:32.991
Jamie, turn your TV on.

39:33.151 --> 39:35.391
There's not going to be
an investigation.

39:35.511 --> 39:38.191
Who gives a toss about cybercrime?

39:38.311 --> 39:39.511
It's over.

39:41.871 --> 39:43.631
What the hell.

39:43.751 --> 39:45.911
Here, have it.

39:46.071 --> 39:48.751
Moscow, six weeks ago,
Thursday the 9th.

39:48.871 --> 39:50.271
That's all I know.

39:50.431 --> 39:53.871
If you want answers, you're going
to have to find them yourself.

39:53.991 --> 39:54.911
Good luck.

39:57.831 --> 40:00.351
On behalf of
the American penal system,

40:00.511 --> 40:02.751
I'd like to thank you
for your stay.

40:02.871 --> 40:04.431
If you've enjoyed your time here,

40:04.591 --> 40:06.951
do please recommend us
to your friends.

40:09.391 --> 40:11.591
Rhonda, get in!

40:12.791 --> 40:13.951
Who the hell are you?

40:14.071 --> 40:15.871
A big fan of your work. Get in.

40:23.071 --> 40:24.471
I'm coming too!

40:24.591 --> 40:26.791
No, drive!

40:36.311 --> 40:38.631
Hey, what's with the Nazi?
This wasn't the plan.

40:38.751 --> 40:40.351
The plan just changed. Drive.

40:40.511 --> 40:42.471
We wish you
a pleasant future,

40:42.591 --> 40:44.111
however short that may be.

40:46.991 --> 40:49.991
And if I may, I'd just like to say
the words "penal system"

40:50.111 --> 40:51.711
over a loudspeaker again.

40:56.311 --> 40:57.871
OK, who's for birthday cake?

41:08.991 --> 41:10.911
'And that was how it started.

41:12.671 --> 41:17.951
'That was the day our old lives ended
and our new lives began.

41:18.071 --> 41:19.791
'34 days ago.

41:27.511 --> 41:29.031
'It feels like a lifetime.

41:34.871 --> 41:38.631
'Back then, we were hurtling through
the universe on our separate paths.

41:38.751 --> 41:40.031
'And then boom...

41:43.191 --> 41:45.471
'..somehow we all collided.

42:07.511 --> 42:09.271
'There's 15 of us in here.

42:09.391 --> 42:10.711
'But why us?

42:10.911 --> 42:12.711
'I mean, we are hardly the A Team,
are we?

42:12.871 --> 42:15.871
'So is this just luck
or something bigger?

42:15.991 --> 42:18.631
'Fate, destiny?

42:18.751 --> 42:21.351
'I mean, are we the chosen ones?

42:21.511 --> 42:23.831
'God, I sound like such
a penis for saying that,

42:23.991 --> 42:27.151
'but still, after everything
that's happened,

42:27.271 --> 42:29.191
'how else do you explain it?'
