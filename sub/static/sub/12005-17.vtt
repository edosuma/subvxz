WEBVTT

00:01.410 --> 00:02.811
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.844 --> 00:03.912
Toby, it seemed like we were
broken up, but I didn't even think

00:03.945 --> 00:05.680
- that you would care.
- Stop talking.

00:05.715 --> 00:07.382
Can you at least tell me
how your music's going?

00:07.416 --> 00:08.550
- Have you been writing?
- We're not doing this.

00:08.584 --> 00:11.286
Why are we talking about Chip Coto?

00:11.320 --> 00:13.321
He's the guy behind the
abstinence-only bill,

00:13.356 --> 00:14.456
but he's sleeping with an intern.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.157
And I'm trying to find out who.

00:16.192 --> 00:18.293
I'm being transferred to
Senator Shershow's office.

00:18.327 --> 00:19.327
Did Coto tell you why?

00:19.362 --> 00:20.295
He told me that his wife

00:20.329 --> 00:22.063
is beginning to suspect.

00:22.098 --> 00:24.132
I hope whoever broke your
heart actually got to hear that.

00:24.166 --> 00:27.068
It's about the man who shot my dad.

00:28.170 --> 00:30.772
Regina, they found my baby.

00:30.806 --> 00:32.741
I'm gonna teach you how to swim.

00:32.775 --> 00:34.042
You won't be the first who's tried.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.011
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.574
I think you need a little more sunscreen.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.644
It's so rare to find an American

00:49.679 --> 00:51.546
with a sense of irony.

00:51.580 --> 00:52.781
I happen to freckle easily.

00:56.752 --> 01:00.155
So the first thing we're
gonna start with is floating.

01:00.189 --> 01:02.290
That's where you're wrong.

01:02.324 --> 01:04.125
What do you mean?

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.936 --> 01:15.937
I wanted to start with
something I knew I'd be good at.

01:17.940 --> 01:20.742
I think you'll be good at this too.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.811
Just take a deep breath

01:22.845 --> 01:26.548
and float face first in the water.

01:32.722 --> 01:34.622
That's it. Perfect!

01:46.302 --> 01:48.136
Need I remind you

01:48.170 --> 01:50.271
that I almost drowned when I was eight?

01:50.306 --> 01:52.207
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:52.241 --> 01:54.175
So sorry.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.277
I got distracted.

01:57.847 --> 01:59.848
Is Coto hitting on her too?

01:59.882 --> 02:01.816
Shouldn't he be off rallying support

02:01.851 --> 02:03.651
for his education bill?

02:03.686 --> 02:05.086
He's got all the votes he needs.

02:05.121 --> 02:07.989
Now he can work on his serve.

02:08.023 --> 02:09.791
That hypocrite!

02:14.697 --> 02:15.697
So?

02:16.732 --> 02:19.200
I don't think it matters which you wear.

02:19.235 --> 02:21.436
They're two gay men. It matters.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.338
Chances are they'll be more turned off

02:23.372 --> 02:27.108
by your stereotyping
than your shirt choice.

02:27.143 --> 02:28.910
Why don't you just let
your lawyers handle this?

02:28.944 --> 02:30.979
Because a legal battle
could drag out for months.

02:31.013 --> 02:32.881
I don't want to waste any more time.

02:32.915 --> 02:35.049
I want to look them in my eye
and ask for my daughter back.

02:38.921 --> 02:40.822
Then go with the light blue.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.724
It brings out your eyes.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.529
Is there any chance you could come with me?

02:50.332 --> 02:53.601
Um, I... I have so much work to do.

02:53.636 --> 02:55.470
It's on Sunday.

02:55.504 --> 02:57.238
It would just raise a ton of questions

02:57.273 --> 03:00.441
about our marriage and
my sobriety... all of it.

03:00.476 --> 03:03.111
It could help convince
them. They could trust me.

03:04.146 --> 03:05.213
Maybe you should take Bay.

03:05.247 --> 03:07.015
She's the baby's big sister.

03:07.049 --> 03:08.750
That's a great idea.

03:08.784 --> 03:09.751
You think she'll come?

03:09.785 --> 03:10.919
Well, why wouldn't she?

03:10.953 --> 03:12.854
It's Bay.

03:25.835 --> 03:27.602
I have to get back to Maui.

03:27.636 --> 03:29.370
My shift starts in an hour.

03:29.405 --> 03:31.539
Yeah, I got to get back to the motor pool.

03:33.309 --> 03:35.343
The problem is I'm not
gonna get out of this bed

03:35.377 --> 03:37.078
as long as you're still in it.

03:38.247 --> 03:40.949
Okay, we both get up on the count of three.

03:44.920 --> 03:45.920
One.

03:45.955 --> 03:47.956
Two.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.791
Three.

03:51.126 --> 03:53.795
Yeah. Yeah, I called that one.

03:55.831 --> 03:58.566
Hey, what are you doing on Sunday?

03:58.601 --> 04:01.336
More of this?

04:01.370 --> 04:05.273
Well, I got us tickets to the
Goose Down concert at Crossroads.

04:05.307 --> 04:07.408
- Are you serious? I love them.
- Mm-hmm.

04:07.443 --> 04:09.477
All right, well, better get out of bed,

04:09.511 --> 04:11.212
so I don't have my weekend leave revoked.

04:14.283 --> 04:15.383
Yes!

04:15.417 --> 04:16.985
I win again.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.821
Last one in bed.

04:19.855 --> 04:22.757
I'm gonna get you next time.

04:22.791 --> 04:25.760
All right, admit it. I'm
a pretty good teacher.

04:25.794 --> 04:28.096
I won't be swimming the
channel any time soon,

04:28.130 --> 04:30.798
but yeah, you are.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.033
Hey, Parker.

04:34.003 --> 04:35.670
I should see what's wrong.

04:35.704 --> 04:37.605
Yeah, I have to get going anyway.

04:41.577 --> 04:42.543
Hey.

04:42.578 --> 04:43.678
Are you okay?

04:43.712 --> 04:44.712
Hi. Yeah, I'm fine.

04:48.317 --> 04:49.651
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

04:49.685 --> 04:52.487
Um, I know I shouldn't be here.

04:52.521 --> 04:55.390
I just... I didn't know what else to do.

04:55.424 --> 04:58.126
He wasn't responding to my texts.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.427
I can't go to his house.

04:59.461 --> 05:02.196
He can't even look at me at the office.

05:02.231 --> 05:05.333
So you and Senator Coto are still...

05:05.367 --> 05:08.169
No, but I had to tell him.

05:08.203 --> 05:10.305
He freaked out.

05:10.339 --> 05:13.141
He thinks it's my fault,
but I was always careful.

05:13.175 --> 05:15.076
- I swear.
- Oh my God.

05:16.545 --> 05:18.146
- Are you... ?
- Yeah.

05:19.581 --> 05:21.316
I'm pregnant.

05:34.330 --> 05:40.007
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:07.129 --> 06:08.396
Hey.

06:08.430 --> 06:10.465
How are you?

06:10.499 --> 06:12.233
Okay.

06:12.267 --> 06:15.336
Uh, I'm working at Camp Wabana.

06:15.371 --> 06:17.205
You're a camp counselor?

06:17.239 --> 06:20.541
Yeah, and I'm actually good at it.

06:20.576 --> 06:23.411
So I heard you're working here now.

06:23.445 --> 06:25.546
Yes. I'm the manager.

06:25.581 --> 06:28.416
And Priya tells me you're getting married.

06:29.451 --> 06:31.352
All true.

06:31.387 --> 06:32.353
Wow.

06:32.388 --> 06:33.421
Congratulations.

06:33.455 --> 06:34.422
Thanks.

06:34.456 --> 06:36.391
It must be nice to be so sure,

06:36.425 --> 06:39.260
to know exactly what you
want and just go for it.

06:39.294 --> 06:41.295
It is.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.531
So it's been a few months

06:43.565 --> 06:46.367
since you've uploaded
anything new onto SoundCloud.

06:47.403 --> 06:49.437
You still follow that?

06:49.471 --> 06:52.206
Yeah, I like to check
in, see what you're up to.

06:52.241 --> 06:54.275
There's only so many times I can listen

06:54.309 --> 06:56.277
to those old "Guitar Face" songs.

07:00.382 --> 07:02.483
Anyway, it was great talking to you.

07:09.324 --> 07:10.491
I'm going to work!

07:12.361 --> 07:14.395
- Two flowers now?
- Yeah.

07:14.430 --> 07:16.531
Mac has a theory that the more we wear,

07:16.565 --> 07:18.266
the more people spend.

07:18.300 --> 07:22.070
Um, you're not working on Sunday, are you?

07:22.104 --> 07:23.171
No, I have Sundays and Mondays off.

07:23.205 --> 07:24.305
Good. I was wondering

07:24.339 --> 07:25.306
if you wanted to come with me

07:25.340 --> 07:27.075
to St. Louis to meet your sister.

07:27.109 --> 07:30.144
Oh wow.

07:30.179 --> 07:32.280
It will be a great father-daughter trip.

07:32.314 --> 07:35.316
It's just... I have plans already.

07:35.350 --> 07:37.418
Ty and I are supposed
to go to this concert.

07:40.355 --> 07:43.257
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I understand.

07:43.292 --> 07:45.093
I should have asked you earlier.

07:45.127 --> 07:47.295
But I'll be able to meet her when
you bring her back here, right?

07:48.330 --> 07:49.564
Right.

07:49.598 --> 07:51.199
I have to get to work.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.433
Okay.

07:58.407 --> 08:01.509
So when are you going to tell me

08:01.543 --> 08:04.112
what's going on with Parker?

08:04.146 --> 08:05.313
It's nothing.

08:05.347 --> 08:07.348
Just girl stuff.

08:08.450 --> 08:11.185
Ah, then I'll have to guess.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.154
Let's see...

08:13.188 --> 08:15.256
Coto's wife found out he's cheating

08:15.290 --> 08:18.159
when he texted a photo of his junk

08:18.193 --> 08:19.327
to his mother-in-law
by mistake.

08:19.361 --> 08:22.163
Eww.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.531
He's going to leave his wife,

08:23.565 --> 08:25.333
but it's not a good time

08:25.367 --> 08:27.235
because their Labor Day
barbecue's coming up.

08:27.269 --> 08:29.437
No, just stop.

08:29.471 --> 08:32.173
Or she's pregnant with his love child.

08:35.177 --> 08:37.145
Seriously?

08:37.179 --> 08:38.312
He got her pregnant?

08:40.282 --> 08:41.515
My God, that guy is...

08:41.549 --> 08:44.385
Jace, just leave it.

08:44.419 --> 08:46.287
How much shelf space does one need

08:46.321 --> 08:48.122
- for a Pulitzer?
- You're not running the story.

08:48.157 --> 08:50.358
Come on. She's clearly not innocent here.

08:50.392 --> 08:52.560
Why are you still protecting this girl?

08:52.594 --> 08:55.329
Because I know what she's going through.

09:05.207 --> 09:09.777
I had a thing with my boss once.

09:09.811 --> 09:10.912
- Oh.
- I mean...

09:10.946 --> 09:13.648
he wasn't married and
I didn't get pregnant,

09:13.682 --> 09:15.850
but it was a mess.

09:17.686 --> 09:19.620
It was last year. I got a job

09:19.655 --> 09:22.723
at the restaurant he was head chef at.

09:22.758 --> 09:25.726
So it was like a sexual harassment thing?

09:25.761 --> 09:28.196
No.

09:29.464 --> 09:34.235
I was into him... like really into him.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.038
And he was...

09:38.173 --> 09:40.174
a good guy,

09:40.209 --> 09:44.045
but it ended badly.

09:44.079 --> 09:46.013
So I know what Parker's going through.

09:52.688 --> 09:54.555
You're judging me.

09:56.491 --> 09:59.660
You don't seem like the type
who'd sleep with her boss.

10:01.597 --> 10:03.564
And what type is that?

10:04.566 --> 10:05.633
I don't know.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.471
Well, you just proved my point.

10:10.505 --> 10:12.240
People hear something like this,

10:12.274 --> 10:14.976
and they make all these judgments

10:15.010 --> 10:17.345
when they don't know
the first thing about it.

10:19.147 --> 10:22.083
I'm not gonna let that happen to Parker.

10:22.117 --> 10:24.151
Fine.

10:24.186 --> 10:26.087
No story.

10:28.991 --> 10:30.725
Thank you.

10:32.561 --> 10:34.528
One, two, three.

10:34.563 --> 10:35.496
Yes!

10:35.530 --> 10:36.530
Beautiful! Perfect!

10:36.565 --> 10:37.732
Lips, lips, lips.

10:37.766 --> 10:40.501
Yes. Yes. Oh...

10:40.535 --> 10:41.535
Perfect.

10:44.450 --> 10:47.821
___

10:48.510 --> 10:50.211
It's the way people meet these days.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.457

10:55.558 --> 10:57.300
___

10:57.698 --> 10:59.797
___

11:00.255 --> 11:01.922
You were married to the fifth one.

11:06.723 --> 11:09.012
___

11:09.013 --> 11:10.613
___

11:10.766 --> 11:11.899
No.

11:14.036 --> 11:15.670
- Not yet.
- Mmm!

11:17.572 --> 11:19.507
Did I tell you he might
get his daughter back?

11:19.541 --> 11:20.541
Oh.

11:20.575 --> 11:22.410
I don't know if he's thinking

11:22.444 --> 11:24.578
we'll raise her together or...

11:25.540 --> 11:28.575
___

11:28.576 --> 11:30.184
I mean, I could.

11:30.218 --> 11:32.119
I loved being a mom.

11:32.154 --> 11:33.321
And I did it all by myself.

11:33.355 --> 11:37.024
I know it sounds crazy,

11:37.059 --> 11:39.360
but maybe this could be our second chance.

11:39.361 --> 11:41.896

12:05.454 --> 12:07.188
Hola, mi amor.

12:07.222 --> 12:09.190
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:09.224 --> 12:10.157
I didn't think you were getting back

12:10.192 --> 12:11.359
from Dallas till tomorrow.

12:18.233 --> 12:20.301
Queria darte una sorpresa.

12:20.335 --> 12:24.205
Look at you. Spanish immersion works.

12:24.239 --> 12:26.140
Oh, I'm not fluent,

12:26.174 --> 12:28.142
but hopefully it will get me by in per...

12:28.176 --> 12:30.978
It feels good to speak English again.

12:32.781 --> 12:33.814
It feels even better to do this.

12:40.889 --> 12:42.456
Hold that thought.

12:50.332 --> 12:52.266
Mmm.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.302
One more month until the wedding.

12:55.337 --> 12:59.006
Well, that's just a
technicality at this point.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.007
Don't you think?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.876
Ahem.

13:03.044 --> 13:04.078
Right.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.109
___

13:12.520 --> 13:15.111
___

13:15.112 --> 13:17.651
___

13:18.301 --> 13:21.428
___

13:34.950 --> 13:37.076
___

13:38.887 --> 13:40.111
___

13:41.140 --> 13:44.164
___

13:52.313 --> 13:55.950
___

13:55.951 --> 13:59.948
- ___
- ___

14:04.703 --> 14:06.217
___

14:10.970 --> 14:16.139
___

14:16.140 --> 14:20.212
___

14:20.913 --> 14:23.718
___

14:28.350 --> 14:29.505
___

14:38.874 --> 14:41.475
Wow. I forgot how good you look

14:41.510 --> 14:42.743
with your clothes on.

14:42.777 --> 14:44.512
Yeah, you too.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.517
Is Regina home?

14:49.551 --> 14:51.252
I should probably say "hey" to her, right?

14:53.121 --> 14:55.122
She is still at work.

14:55.156 --> 14:57.057
And what about Angelo?

14:57.092 --> 14:58.859
Is he around here? He's probably wondering

14:58.894 --> 15:00.027
what I look like by now, right?

15:00.061 --> 15:02.062
Oh, ready to make this official, huh?

15:02.097 --> 15:03.864
Ah, I'm just ready to get it over with.

15:03.899 --> 15:06.133
I remember what it was like
meeting your Kennish dad.

15:06.167 --> 15:08.736
Angelo's not gonna grill you.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.871
Although, if you were older and my boss,

15:10.906 --> 15:12.907
he might punch you.

15:12.941 --> 15:14.675
Long story; Not mine.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.577
Anyway, Angelo's gone for the night.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.746
He went to St. Louis to
try to get the baby back

15:18.780 --> 15:20.514
from the couple who adopted her.

15:22.684 --> 15:24.585
That's... that's cool.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.619
I mean, you're gonna meet your sister.

15:25.654 --> 15:29.323
Uh, he wanted me to go, but...

15:29.357 --> 15:31.025
Why didn't you?

15:31.059 --> 15:33.160
I don't know.

15:33.194 --> 15:34.395
It just felt weird.

15:34.429 --> 15:36.196
And we already have the
tickets for the concert

15:36.231 --> 15:39.033
and honestly, I just thought

15:39.067 --> 15:41.936
it would be more fun to be with you.

15:41.970 --> 15:43.671
Bay, if he doesn't get her back,

15:43.705 --> 15:45.606
this might be your only chance to meet her.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.875
Now I feel even worse.

15:50.845 --> 15:52.613
St. Louis is a three-hour drive.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.381
If we beat traffic...

15:54.416 --> 15:55.449
Ty, you don't have to...

15:55.483 --> 15:56.750
Come on.

16:05.820 --> 16:07.554
Hello?

16:07.588 --> 16:09.622
Hey, it's Toby. Um...

16:09.657 --> 16:13.493
It was really good to see you yesterday.

16:14.628 --> 16:16.362
Yeah, it was.

16:18.332 --> 16:19.632
So what's up?

16:31.325 --> 16:33.046
___

16:33.047 --> 16:34.299
___

16:36.375 --> 16:36.569
___

16:36.570 --> 16:41.292
___

16:45.680 --> 16:47.980
___

16:50.960 --> 16:51.871
___

16:51.872 --> 16:55.137
___

17:03.308 --> 17:05.002
___

17:08.523 --> 17:10.876
___

17:13.170 --> 17:14.926
___

17:22.690 --> 17:27.900
___

17:28.901 --> 17:30.239
___

17:44.084 --> 17:45.351
You do realize your C.D. collection

17:45.386 --> 17:47.220
makes no sense, right?

17:47.254 --> 17:48.321
Yeah, how's that?

17:48.355 --> 17:51.191
Well, you've got old-school Johnny Cash,

17:51.225 --> 17:53.927
some speed metal, which is dude music,

17:53.961 --> 17:56.196
and then Kelly Clarkson.

17:56.230 --> 17:57.931
I like what I like.

17:57.965 --> 18:00.833
And there's nothing in here
remotely like Goose Down.

18:00.868 --> 18:04.671
You know, we could go see music
that you actually want to hear.

18:04.705 --> 18:05.672
Not really.

18:05.706 --> 18:07.607
Johnny Cash is dead.

18:07.641 --> 18:09.709
At least that explains
why you were so willing

18:09.743 --> 18:11.644
to bail on the concert.

18:11.679 --> 18:14.447
This thing kind of seemed
like a no-brainer to me.

18:16.850 --> 18:18.351
What?

18:18.385 --> 18:19.385
Nothing.

18:21.589 --> 18:25.325
It's just my dad left and
I didn't really know him.

18:25.359 --> 18:27.493
And he's got this whole
other family down in Tulsa.

18:27.528 --> 18:29.462
I don't know them either.

18:29.496 --> 18:31.231
What?

18:31.265 --> 18:32.532
Yeah.

18:32.566 --> 18:35.068
I heard he got married after he split.

18:35.102 --> 18:36.369
And, uh...

18:36.403 --> 18:38.204
You know, he didn't want
anything to do with me,

18:38.239 --> 18:39.305
so neither did they.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.042
And you can't really ask me anything else

18:43.077 --> 18:44.744
because that's all I know, so...

18:45.980 --> 18:47.780
How come you never told me that before?

18:48.849 --> 18:50.783
It's not my favorite subject.

18:53.687 --> 18:56.656
Is there anything else I'm
gonna find out about you?

18:56.690 --> 18:57.690
Don't worry.

18:57.725 --> 18:59.592
Nothing scary.

18:59.627 --> 19:00.593
So I'm not gonna find

19:00.628 --> 19:02.695
- any Ke$ha CDs in here?
- Dude!

19:02.730 --> 19:05.498
Do not hate on Ke$ha, all right?

19:05.532 --> 19:07.500
She has her time and her place.

19:08.602 --> 19:10.536
It is amazing what I learn about you

19:10.571 --> 19:13.239
when we actually leave your room.

19:13.274 --> 19:14.274
Yeah.

19:20.314 --> 19:21.314
Do you want to pull over?

19:28.289 --> 19:29.956
Hey.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.057
Oh.

19:31.091 --> 19:32.959
I was just finishing.

19:32.993 --> 19:37.597
I just wanted to let you know that, um...

19:37.631 --> 19:39.465
I found a support group

19:39.500 --> 19:41.768
for girls in your situation.

19:44.438 --> 19:45.538
Yeah, about that,

19:45.572 --> 19:48.241
it turns out I was wrong.

19:48.275 --> 19:49.409
I guess that's what you get for using

19:49.443 --> 19:51.277
a cheap drugstore test.

19:51.312 --> 19:53.346
Wait, it was a mistake? Really?

19:53.380 --> 19:54.514
Uh-huh.

19:54.548 --> 19:57.183
I mean, that's great, but are you sure?

19:57.217 --> 19:59.385
Yeah, I have to get going.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.187
Parker, if he's pressuring you

20:01.221 --> 20:02.955
to do to something that
you're not comfortable with...

20:02.990 --> 20:04.957
He didn't. It was just a mistake.

20:04.992 --> 20:07.727
Now can we pretend this
whole thing never happened?

20:15.569 --> 20:17.637
Yes, I will have that for you tomorrow.

20:17.671 --> 20:18.905
Okay. Bye now.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.508
- And hi now.
- Hi.

20:24.378 --> 20:25.611
Key lime pie is back.

20:25.646 --> 20:27.313
- Awesome!
- Mm-hmm.

20:28.482 --> 20:29.549
That guy with the monster truck

20:29.583 --> 20:31.417
is claiming we broke his gun rack.

20:31.452 --> 20:33.152
He wants to see the manager.

20:33.187 --> 20:35.054
I'll be right out.

20:35.089 --> 20:36.322
You stay right there, okay?

20:36.357 --> 20:37.924
Okay.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.162
___

21:12.356 --> 21:13.457
There you are.

21:13.491 --> 21:14.524
- Hi.
- I was starting to get worried.

21:14.559 --> 21:17.561
Oh, uh, sorry. We... we hit traffic.

21:17.595 --> 21:19.596
But we still have at least an hour, right,

21:19.630 --> 21:20.597
- before we have to meet...
- No.

21:20.631 --> 21:22.299
50 minutes.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.202
Okay, well, Ty, this is Angelo.

21:25.236 --> 21:26.203
- Angelo...
- Hi, nice to meet you.

21:26.237 --> 21:27.204
Heard a lot about you.

21:27.238 --> 21:28.338
I've heard about you, too.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.240
Can I drop my stuff off before we go?

21:30.274 --> 21:31.241
Of course.

21:31.275 --> 21:32.876
Let me get a key to your room.

21:32.910 --> 21:34.778
Your room?

21:34.812 --> 21:36.747
Do you really think he's
gonna let us stay together?

21:36.781 --> 21:37.981
Uh, I don't know.

21:38.015 --> 21:40.584
I mean, he is European.

21:40.618 --> 21:42.519
Here you go.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.620
You're in room 203.

21:43.654 --> 21:45.822
Right next to the one I
will be sharing with Ty.

21:45.857 --> 21:47.824
And for the record,

21:47.859 --> 21:49.726
I'm a light sleeper. The smallest noise...

21:49.761 --> 21:52.462
the door closing, somebody walking...

21:52.497 --> 21:53.497
wakes me up.

22:00.238 --> 22:01.438
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:01.472 --> 22:03.273
What are you doing here on a Sunday?

22:04.442 --> 22:06.009
Um...

22:06.043 --> 22:08.211
I just came by to grab the jacket I left

22:08.246 --> 22:09.279
before I went to Spanish camp.

22:10.815 --> 22:13.049
Is there anything I can help you with?

22:13.084 --> 22:16.653
No, just putting together some research,

22:16.687 --> 22:18.722
still trying to kill that
abstinence-only clause.

22:19.857 --> 22:21.892
Sorry, I know how you feel about it.

22:21.926 --> 22:23.860
Well, it is the only surefire way

22:23.862 --> 22:26.563
to prevent pregnancies, S.T.D.s...

22:26.597 --> 22:29.499
Actually, the states with
the highest rates of teen...

22:29.534 --> 22:31.568
You know, let's just not do this.

22:31.602 --> 22:33.403
Probably not gonna
change each other's minds.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.272
Probably not.

22:35.306 --> 22:36.506
Um...

22:38.242 --> 22:41.912
I kind of wanted to ask
you something else...

22:42.047 --> 22:45.916
- About Simone.
- Simone Sinclair?

22:45.950 --> 22:48.718
Toby didn't tell me how it ended,

22:48.753 --> 22:50.987
but I got the impression that it was bad.

22:51.022 --> 22:54.524
Uh...

22:55.626 --> 22:58.695
she cheated on him... with Emmett...

22:58.729 --> 23:01.364
when Emmett was with Bay.

23:02.733 --> 23:05.669
That is bad.

23:15.079 --> 23:17.147
So her name is Abby?

23:17.181 --> 23:18.281
I love that name.

23:18.316 --> 23:20.984
It's not too trendy. It's not too weird.

23:21.018 --> 23:23.220
We actually named her after

23:23.254 --> 23:24.754
Victor's grandmother Abigail.

23:24.789 --> 23:25.889
Aww!

23:32.630 --> 23:33.864
The brownies are delicious.

23:33.898 --> 23:35.832
That's a miracle

23:35.867 --> 23:37.634
because I'm usually the anti-midas

23:37.668 --> 23:38.735
when it comes to cooking.

23:38.769 --> 23:40.437
Everything I touch turns to charred.

23:40.471 --> 23:42.439
Angelo's a great cook.

23:42.473 --> 23:45.275
Growing up in France, I
couldn't help but learn.

23:45.309 --> 23:47.377
Victor and I have been
meaning to go to Paris.

23:47.411 --> 23:48.478
Oh, you'd love it.

23:48.512 --> 23:50.313
We probably won't be going for a while.

23:50.348 --> 23:52.215
Which is fine.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.316
Of course.

23:56.287 --> 23:58.755
So how was the drive down here?

23:58.789 --> 23:59.956
Not bad.

23:59.991 --> 24:01.057
A little long... you know...

24:01.092 --> 24:02.926
'cause Angelo's such a safe driver.

24:04.929 --> 24:07.631
Ooh, she's up early.

24:07.665 --> 24:09.733
Can I do anything to help?

24:09.767 --> 24:11.635
No, I've got it, thanks.

24:11.669 --> 24:12.702
Could I...

24:14.472 --> 24:16.473
would it be okay if I saw her?

24:16.507 --> 24:19.676
Uh, Abby doesn't always
do so well with strangers.

24:19.710 --> 24:22.145
Bay is not a stranger.

24:22.179 --> 24:23.480
She's her sister.

24:23.514 --> 24:25.248
Um...

24:25.283 --> 24:27.083
come on.

24:27.118 --> 24:28.285
But be warned... when she burps,

24:28.319 --> 24:29.953
it is not unlike Mount Vesuvius.

24:40.194 --> 24:43.763
Who knows? I mean, maybe
it really was a mistake.

24:43.798 --> 24:45.932
Or maybe Parker used to be pregnant

24:45.966 --> 24:47.700
and now she's not.

24:47.735 --> 24:50.670
All I know is that he's sitting over there

24:50.704 --> 24:52.806
working on his tan like
nothing ever happened.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.908
That guy needs to be taught a lesson.

24:54.942 --> 24:56.876
Yeah.

24:56.911 --> 25:00.547
What if we send him an anonymous message

25:00.581 --> 25:02.715
telling him that we know what he did.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.585
What? Like in a bad horror movie?

25:05.619 --> 25:08.221
Just something to let him know that

25:08.255 --> 25:09.622
this time he didn't get away with it.

25:11.492 --> 25:13.093
What are we gonna do?

25:13.127 --> 25:15.228
Send him a note on a cocktail napkin?

25:15.262 --> 25:19.032
Or we could use a slightly faster,

25:19.066 --> 25:20.400
more efficient way of reaching somebody.

25:20.434 --> 25:22.135
You have his phone number?

25:22.169 --> 25:23.169
Of course.

25:23.204 --> 25:25.038
They all text me when
they want their lattes

25:25.072 --> 25:26.139
waiting for them when they get in.

25:26.173 --> 25:27.807
Well, then he'll know who sent it.

25:27.842 --> 25:29.876
I have an app that turns
my phone into a burner.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.035
It's untraceable.

25:32.069 --> 25:33.937
Damn.

25:36.073 --> 25:38.608
"I know...

25:38.642 --> 25:41.744
what happened with...

25:41.779 --> 25:42.879
Parker."

25:45.616 --> 25:46.749
Send?

25:48.586 --> 25:49.586
Seriously?

25:49.620 --> 25:50.720
Why not?

25:50.754 --> 25:52.322
It's not gonna do anything,

25:52.356 --> 25:53.623
but we might as well
play with him a little.

25:57.628 --> 25:59.062
Do it.

26:06.403 --> 26:08.137
- He's got it.
- Oh my God.

26:11.775 --> 26:13.176
He's completely sweating.

26:14.945 --> 26:16.813
What's he doing now?

26:16.847 --> 26:18.081
I think he's responding.

26:18.115 --> 26:19.816
No way.

26:22.753 --> 26:23.786
"Who is this?"

26:25.589 --> 26:28.029
___

26:29.760 --> 26:31.527
What do we want?

26:45.169 --> 26:47.704
We could tell him to resign.

26:48.939 --> 26:49.906
There's no way he'd do that.

26:49.940 --> 26:51.608
There'd be way too many questions.

26:51.642 --> 26:55.445
It has to be something simple, like...

26:55.479 --> 26:56.713
telling him to shave off that stupid beard.

26:56.747 --> 26:58.415
We could ask him to drop his support

26:58.449 --> 27:00.784
for the abstinence-only
clause in the education bill.

27:00.818 --> 27:02.585
That's perfect.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.355
He can always just say
that he changed his mind.

27:06.557 --> 27:08.258
No way. You're typing that?

27:09.460 --> 27:13.029
You said you wanted to do
something important this summer

27:13.064 --> 27:15.031
like stopping that
clause from going through.

27:15.066 --> 27:18.935
And dropping articles in their mailboxes

27:18.969 --> 27:20.103
isn't gonna do jack.

27:26.043 --> 27:27.010
Send it.

28:53.664 --> 28:54.731
Hi.

28:54.765 --> 28:56.466
That's it, sweet girl.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.537
She has Angelo's eyes.

29:00.571 --> 29:02.272
I saw that too.

29:04.642 --> 29:06.543
You know, I think she's ready for you.

29:08.379 --> 29:10.113
Good girl.

29:13.417 --> 29:15.985
- Did I do something wrong?
- No no no.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.353
Here.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.055
That's okay. It's okay, baby.

29:19.089 --> 29:20.957
I'm right here. It's okay.

29:20.991 --> 29:22.258
She's just used to me.

29:24.895 --> 29:26.196
It's okay. Shh.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.064
Daddy's right here. I'm right here.

29:28.098 --> 29:30.967
It's okay, sweet girl.

29:32.770 --> 29:33.803
Is this real mahogany?

29:33.837 --> 29:34.971
Let's cut to the chase.

29:35.005 --> 29:36.673
I only agreed to let you come here

29:36.707 --> 29:37.874
because Leo insisted.

29:37.908 --> 29:40.376
But you're not taking Abby.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.312
She's my daughter.

29:42.346 --> 29:43.713
Abby's birth mother didn't
put you on the certificate

29:43.747 --> 29:46.249
because she didn't want you to
have anything to do with her baby.

29:46.283 --> 29:48.451
That won't matter to the court.

29:48.485 --> 29:51.287
Well, we can prove that
you're an unfit parent.

29:52.456 --> 29:54.424
You abandoned your first
daughter when she went deaf.

29:54.458 --> 29:57.160
It was a lot more complicated than that.

29:57.194 --> 29:59.262
No, not really.

29:59.296 --> 30:01.364
Being a parent means
being there for your child

30:01.398 --> 30:03.299
no matter what,

30:03.334 --> 30:04.867
and you weren't.

30:04.902 --> 30:06.970
And dragging Bay down here

30:07.004 --> 30:08.972
to tell us that you're a safe driver

30:09.006 --> 30:10.139
and you like to cook won't change anything.

30:10.174 --> 30:11.908
That baby in there...

30:11.942 --> 30:13.876
Abby. Her name is Abby!

30:16.914 --> 30:17.847
I'm her father.

30:17.881 --> 30:19.616
No, I'm her father, Leo and I,

30:19.650 --> 30:20.650
so you better lawyer up because you're not

30:20.684 --> 30:21.718
taking Abby away from us.

30:41.262 --> 30:46.000
I had no idea that Regina was your sponsor.

30:46.034 --> 30:48.335
Well, that's kind of the anonymous part

30:48.370 --> 30:50.871
in alcoholics anonymous.

30:50.905 --> 30:53.907
- Right.
- Regina was great.

30:53.942 --> 30:55.209
I mean, she was there for me

30:55.243 --> 30:57.745
when I had no one else.

30:57.779 --> 31:00.781
I wish I could have done more.

31:00.815 --> 31:03.717
I... I didn't even know.

31:05.587 --> 31:07.721
Yeah, I hid it well.

31:10.558 --> 31:13.794
I still feel really terrible

31:13.828 --> 31:16.563
about what I did to
you when I was drinking.

31:16.598 --> 31:19.466
Well, you're making amends now, right?

31:20.468 --> 31:22.236
Yeah.

31:22.270 --> 31:25.072
I swear, going through all this

31:25.106 --> 31:27.074
makes me feel like I'm 100 years old.

31:27.108 --> 31:28.976
I know what you mean.

31:29.010 --> 31:30.978
I mean, not that getting married

31:31.012 --> 31:32.079
is the same as getting sober,

31:32.113 --> 31:36.116
but it makes you grow up all of a sudden.

31:36.151 --> 31:38.986
Well, that's why you called me, right?

31:41.723 --> 31:43.624
You sure you want to do this?

31:46.995 --> 31:50.731
I think tomorrow we should
get your dad back on dish duty.

31:50.765 --> 31:51.865
- Huh?
- Yeah.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.501
It's amazing how fast he went from

31:54.536 --> 31:56.603
"nobody treat me any different"

31:56.638 --> 31:58.706
to "can somebody fluff my pillow?"

32:00.608 --> 32:02.276
No, no. Thanks for calling.

32:02.310 --> 32:04.311
Yeah, all right.

32:04.345 --> 32:06.180
Yeah, I'll talk to you soon.

32:06.214 --> 32:08.282
- How about that.
- Is everything okay?

32:08.316 --> 32:11.151
Apparently Chip Coto
has dropped his support

32:11.186 --> 32:14.321
for the abstinence-only
clause in the education bill.

32:14.355 --> 32:18.158
Coto changed his vote?

32:18.193 --> 32:19.159
Yeah.

32:19.194 --> 32:20.794
Are you kidding me?

32:20.829 --> 32:23.163
I thought he was the one behind the clause.

32:23.198 --> 32:25.699
I have a feeling that
Daphne may have been the one

32:25.734 --> 32:27.634
who changed his mind.

32:27.669 --> 32:29.636
Me?

32:29.671 --> 32:30.671
Mm-hmm.

32:31.940 --> 32:34.541
All that research you've been sending out,

32:34.576 --> 32:35.843
it finally got through to him.

32:35.877 --> 32:38.846
Now, I can't say that I totally agree,

32:38.880 --> 32:41.548
but I am very proud of you.

32:41.583 --> 32:43.517

But, you know,

34:24.397 --> 34:27.366
they can't change the fact
that you are that baby's father.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.135
Yes.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.103
But now it's gonna take
a lot of money and time

34:32.138 --> 34:33.105
to get her back.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.907
She seemed really happy there.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.875
They had four months to bond with her.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.243
And the longer this drags out,

34:38.277 --> 34:39.745
the longer they'll have.

34:39.779 --> 34:41.713
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

34:41.748 --> 34:44.650
I mean, they seemed to really love her.

34:44.684 --> 34:46.752
Bay, I love her too.

34:46.786 --> 34:48.687
Leo was saying

34:48.721 --> 34:50.455
they had a really hard time getting a baby,

34:50.489 --> 34:52.690
you know, 'cause they're gay and...

34:52.725 --> 34:54.525
Why is this my problem?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.594
She's my daughter.

34:55.628 --> 34:57.529
And I didn't even get
the chance to name her.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.464
- Wait, I...
- No, I can't believe it.

34:59.499 --> 35:01.366
You think they should raise her?

35:01.401 --> 35:02.567
I don't know.

35:02.602 --> 35:05.070
All I know is that she started crying

35:05.104 --> 35:07.205
the second I took her out of Leo's arms.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.441
How is she gonna feel when you
take her away from them forever?

35:09.475 --> 35:11.109
Are you taking their side?

35:11.144 --> 35:13.278
After all this time you
spent looking for me?

35:13.313 --> 35:16.181
You said you always felt
like something was missing.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.750
I did, but my parents...

35:21.988 --> 35:23.588
are my parents.

35:24.791 --> 35:25.958
I thought you were
supposed to be helping me.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.363
Did you say any of this to Leo?

35:31.397 --> 35:33.765
No, I... it's just really complicated.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.400
No, not to me it isn't.

35:38.271 --> 35:40.305
I'm going up to the room.

35:43.543 --> 35:45.277

36:23.253 --> 36:24.787
Hey, what's, uh...

36:24.821 --> 36:26.155
going on here?

36:26.189 --> 36:27.890
This is Simone.

36:27.924 --> 36:28.958
Yeah.

36:28.992 --> 36:30.793
And this is Nikki.

36:30.827 --> 36:31.794
Hi.

36:31.828 --> 36:32.928
Hi.

36:32.963 --> 36:34.797
Simone's Uncle owns this place,

36:34.831 --> 36:36.865
and that's how I got the gig here.

36:36.900 --> 36:39.468
Yeah, I'm actually gonna go thank him.

36:39.502 --> 36:40.669
It was nice to meet you.

36:42.572 --> 36:44.640
So how did you know I was gonna be here?

36:44.674 --> 36:46.675
I saw the text on your phone

36:46.710 --> 36:47.643
when I came by.

36:47.677 --> 36:49.278
And you thought we were

36:49.312 --> 36:50.479
secretly hooking up or something?

36:50.513 --> 36:53.315
I know you're tired of waiting for us...

36:53.350 --> 36:55.250
- I would never do that.
- Okay, so why didn't you tell me

36:55.285 --> 36:56.352
that you were performing?

36:56.386 --> 36:58.287
There's nothing going
on between me and Simone.

36:58.321 --> 37:00.489
She's always loved my music

37:00.523 --> 37:03.025
and always expected great things.

37:03.059 --> 37:04.994
Toby, we met through music.

37:05.028 --> 37:07.930
Lately it seems like it
doesn't matter to you as much,

37:07.964 --> 37:10.032
or at least not as much
as it matters to me.

37:10.066 --> 37:11.233
That's not true.

37:13.169 --> 37:16.038
Or maybe it is.

37:16.072 --> 37:17.906
I don't... I don't know.

37:19.809 --> 37:22.945
I actually was coming to find you, anyway.

37:22.979 --> 37:25.614
I got a call a couple of hours ago.

37:25.649 --> 37:28.684
They found the guy who murdered my dad.

37:29.786 --> 37:31.654
Oh.

37:32.856 --> 37:34.590

She's angry at me because she thinks

I'm gonna tear my daughter
away from Victor and Leo.

40:21.558 --> 40:22.524

Somehow it became all about me

40:24.327 --> 40:26.261
ripping her away from the
Kennishes or something.

40:26.296 --> 40:29.464
And what about the baby?

40:33.136 --> 40:35.037
I'm sorry.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.173
What are you going to do?

40:38.208 --> 40:39.908
I'm gonna fight.

40:39.943 --> 40:41.143
I'm gonna fight until I get my kid back.

40:44.047 --> 40:47.115
The education bill officially passed

40:47.150 --> 40:50.118
without the abstinence-only clause.

40:50.153 --> 40:53.956
Now teenagers all over Kansas
can fornicate without shame.

40:53.990 --> 40:55.824
That's not what this is about.

40:55.859 --> 40:57.860
The states with the highest
teenage pregnancies...

40:57.894 --> 40:58.894
I'm kidding.

40:58.928 --> 41:00.596
Congratulations.

41:00.630 --> 41:02.798
You did something this summer.

41:02.832 --> 41:05.634
Can you imagine if anyone here

41:05.668 --> 41:08.704
knew that it was the
intern and the coffee guy

41:08.738 --> 41:10.305
who pulled that off?

41:13.676 --> 41:15.577
See you later.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.420
Oh, this is so much better

41:25.455 --> 41:27.456
than that tense dinner I was about to have.

41:27.490 --> 41:30.225
Yeah, I thought you might
want to get out of there.

41:38.368 --> 41:40.102
You bought the album.

41:40.136 --> 41:41.370
Yes, I did.

41:43.406 --> 41:47.242
Well, we officially had
our first weekend away.

41:47.277 --> 41:50.345
On the bright side, no
matter what we do next,

41:50.380 --> 41:52.247
it has got to be better, right?

41:52.282 --> 41:54.316
It wasn't that bad.

42:05.061 --> 42:07.095
Do you want to go back to your barracks?

42:07.130 --> 42:09.031
In a little while.

42:11.100 --> 42:12.067
Right now it's kind of nice

42:12.101 --> 42:14.336
just hanging out like this.

42:14.370 --> 42:16.972
Come on.

42:22.011 --> 42:23.145
Yeah, it is.
