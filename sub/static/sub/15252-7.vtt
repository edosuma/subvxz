00:00.700 --> 00:02.200
<i>Hey, I'm Chuck.</i>

00:02.300 --> 00:04.400
<i>Here's a couple of things</i>
<i>that you might need to know</i>

00:04.500 --> 00:05.400
<i>and maybe you forgot.</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:10.500
<i>Bryce Larkin</i>
<i>from Connecticut is a spy?</i>

00:10.600 --> 00:13.200
A rogue spy.
Did he try to contact you?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.900
He-he sent...
he sent me an e-mail.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.700
<i>Bryce sent me a whole database</i>
<i>of government secrets.</i>

00:17.700 --> 00:18.900
<i>that are now</i>
<i>locked in my brain,</i>

00:18.900 --> 00:23.000
<i>keeping me in a constant state</i>
<i>of fear, danger and anxiety.</i>

00:23.400 --> 00:25.800
Bryce Larkin.
Dude pretended to be his buddy,

00:25.800 --> 00:28.000
sexed up his girl,
and then got him kicked out of Stanford.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.000
If-if Chuck is Solo,
Larkin is his Fett.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.600
Stanford was five years ago.
You need to move on.

00:41.900 --> 00:42.900
It's our subconscious mind

00:42.900 --> 00:45.000
that we're going to be
talking about today.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.000
How can we penetrate
the human mind?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.700
How can we understand it?

00:50.100 --> 00:51.700
How many images do you see?

00:52.400 --> 00:53.300
Five.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.000
Ten.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.400
There are hundreds of images

00:55.400 --> 00:57.100
compressed inside this picture.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.500
The encoding is special.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.300
You only remember that one.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.500
Your subconscious, though,
saw them all.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.800
We'll see how you do
on the final exam.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.600
I include a section

01:13.600 --> 01:16.700
on subliminal image recognition,
where you'll...

01:19.300 --> 01:20.200
Um...

01:21.100 --> 01:21.500
Thank you.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.600
We'll, uh,
we'll end early today.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.800
Class dismissed.

01:27.700 --> 01:28.300
Professor,

01:28.300 --> 01:29.800
how can we isolate...?

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.400 --> 01:40.800
This is Glass Castle,
reporting hostile contact.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.900
I made a mistake, Black Coat.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.400
I copied intel for myself
onto a disc.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.800
They're after it.
I know I shouldn't have.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.400
<i>Chuck, we have an emergency.</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:22.600
We need to talk.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.200
- I'm on the phone.
- Shh!

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
Not here, not here.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.100
There are spies
at the Buy More.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.500
- Spies? Really?
- Yeah.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tang's minions, man.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
They're everywhere.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
He's like the
dark lord Sauron,

02:34.600 --> 02:35.300
from <i>Lord of the Rings,</i>

02:35.300 --> 02:36.800
only instead of the Ring of Power,
he's taken over

02:36.800 --> 02:38.500
control of the
assistant managership.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.200
Yeah. From me.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.700
Right. Thanks for the reminder.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.800
Got it, man. Listen, we need your help, Chuck.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.200
Help? What am I supposed to do?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.400
- I'm, I'm just...
- Just one...

02:46.400 --> 02:47.600
small Hobbit?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.100
So thought
Frodo Baggins, my friend.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.800
So thought Frodo Baggins.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.300
"Rules and regulations
for the Buy More break room.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.100
From the desk of Harry Tang"?

03:00.100 --> 03:01.500
He doesn't even have a desk.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.700
This is an affront
to human decency.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.300
"No swearing, no expectorating,

03:06.300 --> 03:08.000
no fornicating."

03:08.200 --> 03:10.200
- Wait, people been getting freaky in the break room?
- No.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.100
No. But I liked to know
that I had the option.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.300
Okay, so it's a little strict.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.600
It's torture...  man.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.300
The no-drug policy
includes Red Bull.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
Oh, ouch.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.600
I remember the last time
you tried to detox.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.700
How am I supposed
to move electronics

03:24.700 --> 03:25.700
with the sweaty shakes?

03:25.700 --> 03:29.000
I'm sorry, fellows,
but is this the Talk More?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.900
No, sir, it's
the Buy More.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.500
So why don't you get back to
helping these nice customers

03:34.500 --> 03:37.700
buy more electronics,
Mr. Grimes?

03:42.400 --> 03:43.600
I'm sorry,
but is Harry wearing

03:43.600 --> 03:45.900
a new assistant manager
polo shirt?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.400
It's monogrammed.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.400
He must be stopped.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
Yeah.

03:57.500 --> 04:01.300
Wow. That new hi-def screen
sure shows every wrinkle.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.400
They can hear you.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.900
What? Twinkle.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.400
Every twinkle... in her eye.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.100
Eyes.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.700
We have a situation.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.100
A CIA asset has gone missing.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.600
We've had no communication
from him for two days.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.100
No way.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.300
What, did you flash?

04:21.300 --> 04:22.300
No. I don't have to.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.500
That guy was my professor
at Stanford.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.200
Wait. Asset? He's CIA?

04:29.200 --> 04:30.400
My professor was a spy?

04:30.400 --> 04:33.000
The CIA recruits on campuses
across the country.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.200
Professor Fleming
is a company scientist,

04:35.200 --> 04:36.100
not an operative.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.300
This is our last
communication from him.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.500
This is Glass Castle
reporting hostile contact.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.800
I made a mistake, Black Coat.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.400
I copied intel for myself
onto a disc.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.700
They're after it.
I know I shouldn't have.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.500
Do we know
what intel he copied?

04:50.500 --> 04:51.300
We don't.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.900
He's handled many
sensitive projects

04:52.900 --> 04:53.900
for us over the years.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.900
Any leak could
prove devastating.

04:55.900 --> 04:56.700
How can we help?

04:56.700 --> 04:58.800
Fleming has
contacts in LA.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.500
If we find him,
you can extract him...

05:00.500 --> 05:02.700
We'd like your help
on this, Chuck.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.300
Look, I-I-I really don't think

05:06.300 --> 05:07.600
I'm you're go-to guy on this one.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.400
Your knowledge of Fleming
and Stanford is key here.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.100
We only have his
official reports.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.100
You have a
personal connection.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.100
Yeah, I do have
a personal connection,

05:16.100 --> 05:17.600
a very bad personal connection.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.500
Look, you guys have
the file, okay?

05:19.500 --> 05:22.100
You know all about Fleming
and what happened to me.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.300
The guy kicked me out of school.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.700
Chuck, Professor Fleming
is one of us.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.300
Maybe you can find somebody else
to help you this time.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.600
Maybe just this once.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.300
I'm going deep.

05:37.900 --> 05:38.800
Oh!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.200
Who invented the, uh,
UCLA brain trust?

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
Those are Devon's
fraternity brothers.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.800
We are actually all caravanning up to Stanford

05:50.800 --> 05:52.600
for the UCLA game
this weekend.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.600
Hey, Chuck!

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
Go deep, brah.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.400
Oh.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.700
Ooh!
Right in the pills.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.900
Don't touch...
Please-please don't...

06:00.900 --> 06:02.300
- please don't touch me.
- Chuck.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.700
Come on, man. Let me make it up
to you, bro. Get up.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.200
I got you a ticket
for the game.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.100
Wow. Thanks.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
But, uh...

06:11.600 --> 06:13.500
Sarah and I already have plans.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.300
It's your alma mater, dude.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.800
Look, no offense,
but I'd rather get hit

06:18.100 --> 06:22.300
in the produce section again
than go back to that place.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.500
Suit yourself.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.400
Let's go.
Game on, boys.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.200
Where's the ball?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.800
Uh, listen...

06:28.900 --> 06:31.100
I know that Stanford
doesn't hold a lot

06:31.100 --> 06:32.600
of good memories for you...

06:32.600 --> 06:33.900
Look, Ellie. Ellie.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.500
They kicked me out for
something I didn't do.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.400
Okay? So that's it.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.600
Me and Stanford...

06:40.400 --> 06:41.700
we're officially done.

07:25.300 --> 07:29.200
Chuck, sorry
to see you go, man.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.500
Thanks for
the free cable.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.300
Don't worry,
it's gonna work out, bro.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.800
It sucks you have to leave,
Chuck.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.300
I don't get it, Bryce.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.000
Why are you doing this?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.000
You did this to yourself.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.400
What?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.400
I just flashed on myself.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.900
Why am I in the Intersect?

CHUCK 第1季第7集</font>

08:50.200 --> 09:03.000
<font color=#4096d1>-=破烂熊字幕组=-
翻译：个人ID
校对：个人ID

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So you don't know why
I'm in the Intersect.

09:14.100 --> 09:15.500
Well, you didn't appear
on the NSA radar

09:15.500 --> 09:17.900
until after Bryce sent
you the Intersect.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.200
Same with
the CIA.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.800
Why don't I
find that reassuring?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.300
So the files
that you saw

09:22.300 --> 09:23.700
were of you in
college, right?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.600
Yes. Yes.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.800
What about
Professor Fleming?

09:26.800 --> 09:27.500
I was in his class.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
He was CIA.
Could that be it?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.300
Well, if we can
find Fleming, maybe

09:30.300 --> 09:31.700
he can give us
some answers.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.100
Okay. Let's do that.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.100
It won't be easy.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.300
New intel suggests
the professor is being hunted.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.700
The NSA interviewed one witness
in Fleming's class who ID'd

09:39.700 --> 09:42.700
a Magnus Einersson.
He's an Icelandic spy.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.200
I'm sorry.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.300
<i>Iceland</i> does espionage?

09:45.300 --> 09:47.700
Magnus buys and sells intel
to the highest bidder.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.500
Iceland isn't officially
aware of his activities.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.500
It says here the crossbow
is his weapon of choice.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.600
oh, What, slingshots
too ineffective?

09:58.400 --> 09:59.900
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- What's up?

10:00.900 --> 10:02.200
My lunch break is over.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.000
You haven't seen?

10:04.000 --> 10:04.700
Seen what?

10:05.300 --> 10:07.100
New staggered
lunch schedule.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.000
Dude.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
Single shifts.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
No more fraternization
in the break room.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.400
We can't even eat lunch
together anymore.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.300
No more Wednesday-Friday
surf and turf?

10:18.900 --> 10:20.900
Harry Tang is
drunk with power.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.700
He could have an accident.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.800
I'm just saying.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.700
I know a guy, very reasonable.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.100
His rates, I mean...

10:31.500 --> 10:32.400
not him.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Way to think outside
of the box, Anna.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.900
Me likey.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.300
What do you
say, Chuck?

10:38.400 --> 10:39.800
Are you two crazy? What?

10:39.800 --> 10:40.900
No, I'm not gonna
have a guy

10:40.900 --> 10:43.600
rubbed out just because
he upsets our lunch routine.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.800
I see. So you've already
thrown in the towel. Cool.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.600
Not me, Chuck.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.600
I'm not getting
pushed around anymore.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.700
No way.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.000
I hope you were aiming for
the recycling bin, Grimes,

10:58.500 --> 11:00.400
now that I'm
instituting a new

11:00.400 --> 11:01.900
Buy More Green program.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.200
Tree-hugging is all the rage
these days.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.600
I plan on exploiting
the burgeoning conscience

11:10.600 --> 11:12.400
of the American consumer.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.900
Well, that's very inspiring,
Harry.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.700
I'm gonna be the one
who breaks you, Grimes.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.600
You know why?

11:28.200 --> 11:29.700
Because you're soft...

11:30.500 --> 11:31.800
like pudding.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
I've been doing
all these crunches, man.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.700
- I know, buddy.
- Yeah.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.200
You didn't offer to kill Harry
for Anna, did you?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.600
No. Why?
You want me to kill him?

11:58.600 --> 11:59.400
No.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.200
No, just curious.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.800
We just got a hit off
a traffic camera in Hollywood.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.900
That's Fleming.

12:06.100 --> 12:06.700
Thanks. You just saved me

12:06.700 --> 12:08.800
a lot of investigative work
there, Intersect.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.900
DMV told me that.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.500
Wow, sarcasm.
What a surprise.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.200
We located the car
Fleming was driving.

12:13.200 --> 12:13.900
A local address.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.300
We're bringing him in ASAP.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.400
So what do you need me for?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.700
Yours is a friendly face.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.800
Your professor sees you there,

12:18.800 --> 12:20.100
he'll be more inclined
to cooperate.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.400
- Copy?
- Yeah, except that I wasn't

12:21.400 --> 12:23.300
exactly the professor's star pupil.

12:23.300 --> 12:24.400
We leave in three.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.300
<i>As you're aware,</i>

12:27.300 --> 12:30.000
<i>you scored perfectly</i>
<i>on your midterm exam.</i>

12:31.000 --> 12:33.400
Yeah. Yeah, well,
I was up all night studying.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.500
It was a monster.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.500
No offense.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.300
You even aced
the last section--

12:37.500 --> 12:38.900
encoded images.

12:39.700 --> 12:42.000
That, yeah, those were just
kind of a shot in the dark.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.600
You may be aware,
I keep an answer key

12:44.600 --> 12:47.300
to every exam locked
inside this office.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.700
No, no,
I wasn't aware of that.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.600
Really?

12:51.200 --> 12:54.600
Then how do you explain
the midterm answer key

12:54.600 --> 12:56.700
being found
in your fraternity room?

12:57.100 --> 12:58.400
Uh... I'm-I'm sorry.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.200
Wha... you searched my room?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.400
We received a tip from a student
this morning.

13:03.500 --> 13:08.600
What, you... you got a tip
about my room?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.000
I need to know how you broke
into this office

13:10.000 --> 13:11.700
and stole the answers, Chuck.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.000
I... I didn't steal anything.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.800
I don't have to.
I'm acing your class.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.000
Exactly.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.500
The student also claimed
that you're selling copies.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.300
What?!

13:20.300 --> 13:21.800
I know you're
a scholarship student,

13:21.800 --> 13:24.100
and that Stanford
is a very expensive school...

13:24.100 --> 13:28.800
Look, look, who-whoever
gave you your tip... was lying.

13:30.700 --> 13:33.400
Our source was Bryce Larkin,

13:33.800 --> 13:35.400
your roommate.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.400
All right.
We all know the game.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.300
We all know the rules.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.300
This is "Fingers of Fury."

13:53.300 --> 13:54.600
The win goes to the contestant

13:54.600 --> 13:57.900
who can identify the most TV shows
in a minute, all right?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.300
Who do you want next?

14:00.600 --> 14:01.800
I challenge...

14:03.000 --> 14:05.100
the ruling champion,
Morgan Grimes.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.800
That's Mr. Morgan Grimes
if you're nasty.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.300
Really.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.500
Ooh, the suspense.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.300
You don't want me, punk.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.400
Oh, yes, I do.

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
Challenge accepted.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.500
Bang!

14:14.100 --> 14:15.300
On my mark!

14:15.900 --> 14:16.700
Three...

14:17.300 --> 14:18.100
two...

14:18.700 --> 14:19.500
one!

14:19.600 --> 14:20.300
Mark!

14:21.500 --> 14:22.200
<i>Dukes of Hazzard.</i>

14:22.200 --> 14:23.300
- <i>One Tree Hill.</i>
- <i>Veronica Mars.</i>

14:23.300 --> 14:24.200
- <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>
- <i>Cold Case.</i>

14:24.200 --> 14:25.900
- ???
<i>Animaniacs.</i>

14:26.000 --> 14:28.100
- Uh... - ???
- <i>Smallville.</i>
- <i>O.C., Season 2.</i>

14:28.100 --> 14:29.500
- ???
- Underrated.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.500
<i>Kung Fu: The Movie.</i>

14:30.500 --> 14:32.300
??? <i>Night Court. Night Court.</i>

14:33.500 --> 14:34.700
Um, they're not changing.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.800
Anna, the channels
are not changing.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.300
It is now mine.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.900
The one remote
that controls them all.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.800
The master remote.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.900
Your slacking days are over.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.800
Tang, there aren't
even any customers.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.900
Three repair orders
just came in,

14:49.900 --> 14:52.900
which you Nerds would know
if you were at your stations.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.300
And Grimes,
since there aren't

14:55.300 --> 14:56.500
any more customers,

14:57.200 --> 14:59.700
I need a cleanup in the
diaper-changing station.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.800
Wear a mask.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.600
We'll extract the professor
as quickly as possible.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.300
You'll keep watch?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.700
If I flash on any
bad guys, I'll call.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.500
Everything looks quiet, but...

15:12.500 --> 15:15.000
I know. I know.
Stay in the car.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.200
Okay, good.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.200
Let's go.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
Professor Fleming? Hey!

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
No, no, no, no, wait, Professor!
It's me, Chuck!

15:55.100 --> 15:56.600
Professor, stop.
We're here to extract you!

15:56.600 --> 15:58.400
Glass Castle!
Glass Castle!

15:58.700 --> 16:00.900
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.700
But it's... it's Chuck.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.400
I wa... I was in your...

16:06.400 --> 16:09.200
your Psychology and Symbolism
class at Stanford.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.900
- I don't know if you remember me, but...
- Chuck Bartowski.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.200
Of course
I remember you.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.300
Yeah, I guess
it's not every day

16:16.300 --> 16:18.200
you kick a guy
out of school, huh?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.400
At least I hope not.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.500
So you're, uh,
with the Agency now.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.000
Why didn't you say so?

16:26.200 --> 16:28.800
I don't think
I'm supposed to, really.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.200
Well, we have code phrases.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.200
Didn't they train you?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.600
I-I mostly just stay in the car.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.800
Next time,
if it's a dangerous situation,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.700
say, "Are you coming
to the toga party?"

16:40.200 --> 16:41.900
A real...
a real code phrase.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.100
I like it.
That's awesome.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.200
So, uh,
so what are we doing now?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.700
- Who's-who's bringing me in?
- Oh, right.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.500
Yeah, so, uh, Sarah and Casey

16:47.900 --> 16:49.800
will... will do
that, but, um...

16:49.900 --> 16:52.300
I was wondering if I could
ask you something first?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.800
Why did the CIA have a file
on me at Stanford?

17:00.300 --> 17:01.600
I'm sorry.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.099
Oh, hey, hey... hey!

17:06.300 --> 17:10.200
Hey, buddy, let's not
beat ourselves up, you know.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.000
The past is the past.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.500
Okay, look, uh, we didn't really
know each other that well

17:16.500 --> 17:18.800
at college, and this is
a little awkward,

17:18.800 --> 17:19.099
so...

17:20.000 --> 17:22.099
What... Oh, boy!

17:22.500 --> 17:24.599
Oh, boy!
Hey, hey, hang in there.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.900
Hang... hang in there!

17:26.900 --> 17:29.100
Give this to Bryce Larkin.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.900
Bryce?

17:31.200 --> 17:31.900
Bryce Larkin?

17:31.900 --> 17:34.300
What does Bryce have to do
with this?

17:49.300 --> 17:50.500
I'm nobody, I swear.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.400
casey, come on. over here!

17:54.800 --> 17:55.800
Man down!

17:55.800 --> 17:57.200
Man down! Help me!

17:57.200 --> 17:58.100
Help!

17:58.200 --> 17:59.800
Hey, hey, come on!

17:59.800 --> 18:01.200
Come on!

18:11.600 --> 18:13.700
I'm sorry, Chuck,
but we have to talk.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.700
Okay.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.700
So how was the hospital?

18:18.500 --> 18:19.800
Is the professor
going to be okay?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.100
They putting him
into surgery now.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.500
The problem is,
we can't talk to him

18:22.500 --> 18:23.700
to sort this mess out.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.400
You sure it was Magnus you saw?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.700
Gee, I don't know, Casey.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.600
How many psycho archers
do <i>you</i> know?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.700
I asked Fleming
about Stanford.

18:30.700 --> 18:31.700
About why I was
in the Intersect.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.400
I should've brought him
right to you, I'm sorry.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.100
Hey, it's not your fault, Chuck.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.800
Yeah, well, I keep thinking
about what he said.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.200
Why would he want me
to bring those numbers to Bryce?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.900
Bryce must have been
one of his CIA contacts,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.800
and Fleming was probably

18:43.800 --> 18:45.300
never told of his death.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.900
List off the numbers
you remember.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.500
I don't know,
there were, like ten of them.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.600
A couple of nines,
uh... a five...

18:50.600 --> 18:52.700
- Definitely started with a two.
- That's it?

18:52.700 --> 18:53.800
You have a computer
for a brain...

18:53.800 --> 18:57.000
Look, it was a very stressful
situation, okay, Casey?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.500
I watched a guy get
skewered by a crossbow.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.000
Look, Fleming knew something.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.500
Right before he fell,
he said, "I'm sorry."

19:03.500 --> 19:04.700
Why would he say that?

19:04.900 --> 19:06.000
I don't know, Chuck.

19:06.700 --> 19:07.700
Yeah, well,
I think he might know

19:07.700 --> 19:09.200
why I'm in the Intersect.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.200
You okay?

19:14.100 --> 19:15.400
It's not too late for you
to change your mind

19:15.400 --> 19:17.300
about revisiting
the old alma mater.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.100
Spending some time
with me and Devon...

19:20.100 --> 19:21.400
Oh, please!

19:21.500 --> 19:22.900
You just don't want to be
stuck in a car alone

19:22.900 --> 19:25.100
with Awesome's frat buddies.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.000
Maybe,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.400
or maybe I'm your sister
and I care

19:28.400 --> 19:31.000
about you and I think
that going back to Stanford

19:31.000 --> 19:33.300
would help you to move on.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.200
I love you, sis,

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
an-and I take a lot
of bullets for you,

19:37.400 --> 19:41.500
but five hours in a car
with Awesome and his "brahs"?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.700
That is asking too much.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.300
Besides, if I came,

19:45.400 --> 19:46.200
you wouldn't have room

19:46.200 --> 19:48.100
for your fun, old foam finger!

19:48.100 --> 19:48.600
Stop it.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.800
- What is this?
- I don't know.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.000
But look at
what I found.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.300
You see this? It was in
my old college stuff.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.100
<i>The Decline and Fall</i>
<i>of the Roman Empire.</i>

19:57.300 --> 19:59.600
You want me to return it
to the Stanford Library for you?

20:00.300 --> 20:03.000
No. Well, I'd kind of
like to finish it.

20:03.700 --> 20:04.800
See how it ends.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.900
Chuck, that book is,
like, four years overdue.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.000
What do you think
Stanford's going to do, huh?

20:09.500 --> 20:10.400
Expel me?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.300
<i>You're a dead man,</i>
<i>Chuck Bartowski.</i>

20:47.700 --> 20:49.900
- All right!
- Come on, Bryce!

20:51.100 --> 20:52.000
Give it up, buddy.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.800
I know you're out of ammo.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.900
I've been counting.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.600
Buddy.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.000
Whoa, whoa, oh.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.900
You wouldn't fire
at an unarmed guy.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.500
I might.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.600
It's hardly sportsmanlike.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.800
What's this?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.500
<i>Gynecology for Geeks.</i>

21:11.700 --> 21:12.600
You read this?

21:12.600 --> 21:13.800
No. Is it a good read?

21:15.300 --> 21:16.300
Gotcha.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.500
Larkin over
Bartowski again.

21:25.700 --> 21:26.900
<i>I know what the numbers mean.</i>

21:27.400 --> 21:29.300
They're for a book
in the Stanford Library.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.400
Bryce had a place where he
would stash stuff, right?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.900
I bet he told
Fleming about it.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.400
The professor must have the
intel there for Bryce to find.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.600
And now it's only
a matter of time

21:36.600 --> 21:39.200
before Magnus figures it out
and beats us to the book.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.800
- Bingo.
- Unless we can beat him to it.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.700
Well, Bryce kept his stuff
on the third floor.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.100
There was a turn...

21:49.800 --> 21:51.200
I'd have to be there
to remember.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.600
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.200
but I have to go back
to Stanford.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.200
Cool.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.300
This is really
freakin' me out.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.600
It's like nothing
has changed.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.300
Is that good
or bad?

22:21.600 --> 22:24.900
It's, uh, it's, uh,
you know, yeah.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.600
It's, yeah.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.000
Whoo, go, Bruins!

22:31.700 --> 22:36.200
Put me down! Stop it!

22:36.500 --> 22:37.900
You ladies ready to rock?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.200
Yeah, when you
put it that way,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.100
maybe not. Okay.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.500
- Nice barbecue.
- Whoo!

22:43.000 --> 22:43.900
Whoo you!

22:44.700 --> 22:46.100
Uh, you want
to meet us

22:46.100 --> 22:47.400
at the stadium?
I think we're probably

22:47.400 --> 22:50.000
gonna hang out here
until the game starts.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.100
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take Sarah
for the Chuck Bartowski

22:53.100 --> 22:54.300
memorial tour.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.400
So call me
if any rabid Stanford fans

22:56.400 --> 22:58.200
decide to put Awesome
in the hospital.

22:58.300 --> 23:00.600
- Ah. - See you.
- Have fun. Bye. - Bye.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.200
Plant a Stanford tree.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.800
Create a renewable resource
for your children's future.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.700
Oh, you want to save
our environment?

23:13.300 --> 23:14.600
Take a shower, hippie.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.200
Nice job blending in
with the crowd.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.600
Who you rooting for, death?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.600
Leave the quips to me.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.700
The library's this way,
across the quad.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.300
What is it?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.100
I don't know.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.200
I mean,
I figured this would be tough,

23:37.200 --> 23:41.300
but this place is just a lot
to take in, you know?

23:42.000 --> 23:42.400
I used to have

23:42.400 --> 23:44.100
so much fun here, and then...

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
And then?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.400
It was the worst day
of my life...

23:49.200 --> 23:50.500
getting kicked out of here.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.300
Having to hear Ellie's
voice when I told her

23:52.300 --> 23:53.500
I was coming home.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.000
Packing up
all my stuff

23:55.000 --> 23:57.200
and leaving
as Bryce just stood there.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.100
Said I brought it on myself.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.400
Why do you think
that Bryce betrayed you?

24:04.800 --> 24:05.600
I don't know.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.200
He's had four years to call
and set the record straight.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.400
Now that he's gone...

24:12.100 --> 24:13.200
You know what? Forget it.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.700
Bryce has betrayed
a lot of people, hasn't he?

24:18.200 --> 24:20.600
Hmm. Roger that.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.300
All right, we have to
play this really cool.

24:25.300 --> 24:26.500
Magnus has the
library book number.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.700
He could have
beaten us here.

24:27.700 --> 24:28.400
You think he's in there?

24:28.500 --> 24:29.900
Look, maybe you should
stay here.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.600
Yeah, 'cause that always
works out well.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.000
Anyway, you can't find
the book without me.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I'm going in.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.000
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
You looking for this?

24:45.200 --> 24:46.500
You stole my ID?

24:46.800 --> 24:48.500
I borrowed it to reactivate it.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.400
Sorry I couldn't wipe

24:49.400 --> 24:51.400
the idiot grin off your face
with Photoshop.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.000
We have a situation.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.200
We have a situation here..

25:12.100 --> 25:13.900
Harry Tang is a control freak

25:15.000 --> 25:17.200
and his master remote
is a symbol of that control.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.800
It's his totem.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
We steal the remote

25:20.500 --> 25:22.400
and we take control of the
televisions in the store.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.800
Rendering Harry impotent.

25:24.900 --> 25:25.800
That's totally

25:25.800 --> 25:27.200
curable, by the way.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.000
Yeah. Here's the thing.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.300
He keeps the remote
in his locker, does he not?

25:31.300 --> 25:33.800
He does, but it's padlocked--
Harry has the only key,

25:34.800 --> 25:36.300
- So...
- I can get it.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.500
Trust me,
you do not want to know.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.700
I-I <i>do</i> want to know.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.700
- I want to know.
- You guys want to know?

25:45.700 --> 25:47.000
You should make a judgment call.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.000
Assistant Manager Tang?

25:56.900 --> 25:57.700
I'm busy.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.400
I'd like your opinion
about how we could streamline

26:01.400 --> 26:04.500
our standing work orders
to operate more efficiently.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.600
That's a admirable goal,
young lady.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.500
You know, your new
position of authority

26:10.500 --> 26:12.300
has changed you.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.200
You look different.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.300
Maybe it's the new
monogrammed shirt.

26:18.700 --> 26:22.300
Maybe it's just
the cut of your slacks.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.300
I hope you plan
to make other changes

26:24.300 --> 26:25.700
around the Buy More.

26:26.300 --> 26:29.000
In fact, I can't wait

26:29.100 --> 26:31.800
for your next massive...

26:32.100 --> 26:33.600
invasive...

26:34.100 --> 26:35.200
move.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.800
Well, uh, for starters,

26:38.800 --> 26:42.200
I-I think that the staff
sits around too far...

26:42.200 --> 26:43.400
far too often.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.500
Thank you.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.500
There. There, that row.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.100
Oh, no.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.500
We're too late.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.300
Magnus beat us here.
He's got the book.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.500
Hold on.

27:09.000 --> 27:09.900
Got ya.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
Hold on a sec.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.200
Got ya.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.300
The intel.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.600
The book number was just a way

27:27.600 --> 27:29.000
to mark the spot
for the professor.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.100
Okay, well, let's get out of
here before Magnus realizes

27:31.100 --> 27:32.800
that book he has is worthless.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.400
Hey, you, don't move!

27:34.500 --> 27:35.800
Charles Bartowski...

27:36.700 --> 27:41.400
You still owe the library
$294.68 in late fees.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.800
Do you... do you take
credit cards?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.100
This isn't funny.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.500
Chuck, run.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.900
Chuck, this way. Back door!

27:53.100 --> 27:54.400
CHEERLEADERS:
Be aggressive! B-E...

27:54.400 --> 27:56.800
It's hard to hate Stanford
'cause they suck so hard.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.800
I wish we were playing
SC today, huh?

28:28.000 --> 28:28.600
There you are.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.100
Hey, you, freeze!

28:32.300 --> 28:35.100
All right. They spotted us.
Okay, we have to go.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.800
- I swear this school has it in for me.
- Come on.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.900
That guy's wasted.
I want what he had.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.200
Jackpot, baby.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.800
Looking for something,
Mr. Grimes?

29:05.500 --> 29:07.500
Are you kidding me?
You betrayed us?

29:11.900 --> 29:14.200
Nice try, pudding.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.100
I'm not afraid of you,
Harry, okay?

29:16.100 --> 29:17.000
You can't fire me.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.200
No, but I can make you
wish I did.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.800
I need fresh bodies in the hole.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.400
Come on, dude, not-not the hole.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.500
Harry, just let's...

29:34.100 --> 29:35.500
We're safe for now.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.100
I need to see
what's on this disk.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.100
Hey, Chuck,
that is top secret.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.200
Yeah, well, so am I,

29:40.400 --> 29:41.600
and there could be
answers on this disk

29:41.600 --> 29:43.000
about why I'm
in the Intersect.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.700
That's testing data.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.200
And videotaped
interviews.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.300
These are all
just students.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.700
Exactly. Students
that were recruited

29:54.700 --> 29:56.200
into the CIA
by Fleming.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.500
Ten years worth.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.000
It's all their current
information.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.700
No wonder Magnus
wanted it so badly.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.600
Foreign governments
pay a fortune for that.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.800
Look at this right
next to 2002--

30:03.800 --> 30:04.700
Bryce Larkin.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.900
Bryce joined the CIA
our junior year?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.300
That's enough. Now we
know what he's after

30:08.300 --> 30:10.500
No, wait, wait, wait! That's me.
That's me! I'm in here, too.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.300
- Click it.
- Don't click it.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.000
I never applied with the CIA.

30:15.300 --> 30:16.300
Chuck, get down!

30:25.300 --> 30:28.100
Don't you think this would be
a good time for me to be waiting in the car?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.900
I have an idea.
Get me out of here!

30:44.200 --> 30:46.900
Chuck, when I say go,
run out the side door.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.000
Protect the disk.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.900
We'll cover you.

30:50.100 --> 30:50.900
Go!

30:59.900 --> 31:00.600
Ouch.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.200
All right, computers.
Here we go.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.900
Okay, okay.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.300
Come on.

31:21.700 --> 31:22.800
Excuse me.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.600
Hello?

31:24.600 --> 31:27.500
Hi. Hi. Uh, is this...
is this Glenda Mitchell?

31:27.500 --> 31:29.500
We're in the Science building
lecture hall.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.200
It's an emergency.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.700
Bring lots of big guns.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.700
I'm sorry. Whoever this is,
you've got the wrong number.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.200
Crap, there's a code phrase.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.900
Are you coming
to the toga party?

31:42.300 --> 31:43.900
There's a place you can
plant it in the quad.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.400
Let me give you the directions.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.100
Listen we have a situation
right now.

31:50.100 --> 31:53.000
Bring any ammunition
and-or equipment you might have

31:53.000 --> 31:54.400
for killing bad guys.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.900
Are you coming
to the toga party?

32:00.200 --> 32:01.900
Lots of bad guys are surrounding us.
Thank you very much.

32:01.900 --> 32:03.600
Are you coming to the toga party?
Bye-bye.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.400
Agent Katz?

32:08.400 --> 32:09.700
Yeah. Hey, Frodo, is that you?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.300
I thought my code name
was Samwise Gamgee?

32:11.300 --> 32:14.400
Hey, Samwise, why don't you
get your thumb out?

32:14.400 --> 32:17.100
Morgan, listen, this is really,
really not a good time.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.900
Yeah, it's not a good time
over here, either, dude.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.200
Okay, I'm stuck in the hole
doing customer service.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.200
Ow!

32:22.200 --> 32:23.600
These kids are animals.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.300
Okay, buddy, I get that,
but I'm at Stanford.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.300
What do you want me
to do about it?

32:26.300 --> 32:27.900
Do you have the code to

32:27.900 --> 32:28.900
Harry Tang's master remote?

32:28.900 --> 32:30.700
I think I can use it
to bargain for my freedom.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.000
Okay, okay, the code is OU812#.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.000
Dude, this is why
you're my hero.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Thank you so much.

32:39.400 --> 32:39.800
All right, one at
a time. Guys...

32:39.800 --> 32:40.800
Throwing things at
an adult's heads

32:40.800 --> 32:42.000
is not the way to...

32:42.000 --> 32:43.500
That's not gonna
help you in life.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.000
Oh, no.

33:06.100 --> 33:07.400
I only got two rounds left.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.100
I got half a mag.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.700
Drop your weapons and stand up!

33:11.900 --> 33:13.300
Hands where we can see them!

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
I'm gonna go for it.

33:16.300 --> 33:17.100
You in?

33:17.400 --> 33:18.400
You bet.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.200
I hate long good-byes.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.200
Actually, why don't you
drop your weapons.

33:28.000 --> 33:28.600
Looks like someone called

33:28.600 --> 33:30.300
- the cavalry.
- Good.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.100
'Cause I only had one shot left.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.800
Aren't you in
Econ with me?

33:51.900 --> 33:53.100
Please don't.
Please don't, please don't,

33:53.100 --> 33:54.600
please don't,
please don't.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.100
Don't.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.300
Hah!

34:05.100 --> 34:06.600
You must be
Chuck Bartowski.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.800
I just got your message.
Are you okay?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.699
I'm just glad you
check your voice mail.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.800
He's probably got a game plan.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.400
He's got a good caddy with him.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.900
The wind's blowing
the right way.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.300
Roller Derby?

34:29.300 --> 34:30.199
What's going on?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.500
???

34:32.500 --> 34:36.400
She gets passed.
???

34:36.400 --> 34:37.400
What's happening?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.500
???

34:40.500 --> 34:42.000
Grimes!

34:46.600 --> 34:47.699
Hey, what's up, Harry?
What's going on?

34:47.699 --> 34:49.400
You reprogrammed my remote.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.600
Wow, you... you can do that?

34:51.600 --> 34:52.900
You've gone too far, Grimes.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.000
I've done nothing of the sort.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.699
I've actually been here
all day helping these

34:56.000 --> 34:57.200
lovely customers.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.000
But I may be
able to fix it...

35:02.300 --> 35:03.300
for a price.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.100
I want out of the hole.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.400
I'd rather take a potato peeler
to my groin.

35:10.800 --> 35:11.500
Okay.

35:12.100 --> 35:12.900
Fine with me.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.400
I hope that Big Mike doesn't
get too upset though

35:15.400 --> 35:17.500
if all the televisions
just happen to change

35:17.500 --> 35:18.400
to, I don't know...

35:19.800 --> 35:21.000
<i>Passion Cove.</i>

35:22.400 --> 35:23.800
Quid pro quo, Harry.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.000
Yes or no?

35:31.100 --> 35:32.000
That a boy.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.200
Nice and easy.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.600
Smart man.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.600
You're dismissed.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.100
Go ahead.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.300
Yes!

35:47.400 --> 35:48.500
True leader.

35:48.700 --> 35:51.700
It's... the Grimes.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.300
<i>I can't believe that game</i>
<i>was such a wash.</i>

35:56.300 --> 35:57.400
<i>What a blowout.</i>

35:57.800 --> 35:59.700
Worst game ever.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.800
It's not coming off.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.800
I think I used
the wrong kind of paint.

36:03.900 --> 36:04.900
Well, what
brand was it?

36:05.400 --> 36:06.800
Brand? I don't know.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.500
One of the guys picked it up.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.100
I'll get some
stronger soap.

36:11.700 --> 36:14.200
So... how
painful was it?

36:14.200 --> 36:15.800
Not The game, I mean.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.700
Well, uh, do you remember
the evening with Morgan

36:18.700 --> 36:19.800
at the karaoke club?

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
His cover of Peter Cetera's
"Glory of Love"

36:21.800 --> 36:22.900
that he dedicated to you?

36:22.900 --> 36:24.900
That completely ruined
<i>Karate Kid II.</i>

36:24.900 --> 36:27.600
Seriously, though, thanks...
thanks for pushing me.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.200
After the initial shock
and horror, it was a relief

36:30.200 --> 36:31.700
to finally go back, you know,

36:31.700 --> 36:32.800
say good-bye.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.000
Well, I'm proud of you.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.200
You know, you faced
your past head on.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.800
Did you find what
you were looking for?

36:43.000 --> 36:43.900
Almost.

36:45.000 --> 36:45.900
You'll get there.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.900
You didn't think we'd let
you keep that, did you?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.500
I need to know, Sarah.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.300
Okay, Chuck.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.200
Test subject 0326.
Bartowski.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.000
This will be
his first interview.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.500
Send Chuck in.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.700
Bryce...

37:25.000 --> 37:25.700
this isn't a good time.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.100
I'm waiting for
another student.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.600
Chuck Bartowski?

37:29.600 --> 37:31.000
He never got
your message.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.500
What are you
talking about?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.900
You put Chuck on the
CIA recruitment track.

37:35.900 --> 37:37.600
It's not up to me, Bryce.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.200
They want him
for the Omaha Project.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.700
But that's
a military operation.

37:40.900 --> 37:42.300
- They'll turn Chuck into...
- I'm required to send

37:42.300 --> 37:44.700
all the top test results
to the agency.

37:45.600 --> 37:46.900
I want my friend
out of this.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.500
He's a perfect candidate.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.600
Keywords in his essay
responses correlate

37:50.600 --> 37:54.100
to 98% of the subliminal
images in the exam.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.300
You don't get it.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.600
Chuck's a good person.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.700
He's got too much heart
for this kind of work.

38:00.700 --> 38:01.800
He's no operative.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.200
You can't put him
out in the field.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.500
He won't survive.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.500
The agency
is not gonna let go

38:07.500 --> 38:09.600
of a recruit
this promising.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.300
The amount of information
he can retain?

38:12.500 --> 38:14.000
They're not gonna
give him a choice?

38:14.700 --> 38:16.300
He's in no matter what.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.300
If he cheated on the exam,

38:24.300 --> 38:25.700
copied all the answers....

38:26.700 --> 38:28.600
then it would invalidate
the results, wouldn't it?

38:29.300 --> 38:30.400
Yes.

38:31.000 --> 38:31.900
Good.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.500
Now you're going to
help me, Professor.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.000
Bryce framed me for cheating...

38:41.300 --> 38:42.500
to save me.

38:44.200 --> 38:44.600
Why didn't he

38:44.600 --> 38:46.200
just tell me that to begin with?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.200
He couldn't.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.500
They had already recruited him.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.000
Well, if he had good reason
for getting me kicked out,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.500
maybe he had a good reason to
break into the Intersect, too.

38:57.300 --> 39:00.100
Maybe he had a good reason
for sending it to you.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.900
I just wish I could talk to him.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.500
It must have tore him up
to not be able to tell me.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.100
No one can know about this.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.500
For your own
safety, okay?

39:15.700 --> 39:16.700
Sure.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.800
No one would believe me anyway.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.300
Hey, are you
in double-E 131?

40:07.600 --> 40:08.600
It's pretty brutal, huh?

40:09.900 --> 40:11.100
Oh, yeah.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.300
Yeah, I...

40:12.800 --> 40:13.700
The only reason I signed up

40:13.700 --> 40:16.000
is 'cause I'm building
my own version of, uh...

40:18.200 --> 40:19.700
It's kind of embarrassing
actually.

40:19.700 --> 40:20.500
What?

40:21.600 --> 40:23.500
You don't remember
that old computer game,

40:23.500 --> 40:24.700
Zork, do you?

40:25.400 --> 40:27.300
You are likely to be eaten
by a grue.

40:28.200 --> 40:28.800
Holy crap,

40:28.800 --> 40:30.600
- you do remember Zork.
- I love that game.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.900
I mean I haven't
thought about in a while.

40:32.900 --> 40:34.600
Oh, it's probably
a good thing.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.200
I disagree.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.000
It's 1999.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.400
The next millennium
belongs to the geek.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.900
All right.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.500
But still, you know,

40:43.500 --> 40:45.800
text-based computer
games don't exactly

40:45.800 --> 40:47.600
play with the chicks.

40:48.700 --> 40:51.500
This girl Jill on my floor
is nuts about EverQuest.

40:52.100 --> 40:52.900
Are you serious?

40:52.900 --> 40:54.000
If you want,
you can meet her.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.600
- Really? Right now?
- Yeah.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.600
She's over in the quad.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.300
Uh, yeah, I-I would...

40:59.500 --> 41:00.900
I would very much
like to meet her.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.100
- Need some help?
- No. Oh, no, I'm fine.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.500
I just, uh... you know...

41:06.000 --> 41:06.800
College...

41:07.100 --> 41:09.600
I'm-I'm... hi, I'm
Chuck, by the way.

41:09.600 --> 41:10.800
- Bryce. Nice to meet you, Chuck.
- Hi.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.100
Yeah, nice to meet you.

41:13.400 --> 41:17.500
So she really genuinelly likes EverQuest star?
i mean it's..

41:17.500 --> 41:18.500
yeah...

41:18.500 --> 41:25.900
