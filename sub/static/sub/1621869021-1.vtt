01:35.042 --> 01:37.581
Hey, ey, ey,
not so fast there, young lady.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.540
I made pancakes.

01:39.542 --> 01:40.998
Oh, don't you roll your eyes
at me.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.956
I wasn't.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.331
You think I was born yesterday?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.500
Come, sit next to your sister.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.583
- Good?
- Mmhmm.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.581
They were always your favourite
when you were a little girl.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.540
"Grandma Betty,"
you used to say,

01:59.542 --> 02:01.290
"Panacakies and panacakies."

02:02.333 --> 02:04.417
'Cause you could never
say the word "pancake".

02:34.042 --> 02:35.706
Hey, I gotta go.

02:35.708 --> 02:36.623
I'm late.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.498
See you later.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.498
- Bye, lovey.
- Bye.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.458
Muah.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.665
- Bye, Stacy.
- Yeah.

02:42.667 --> 02:43.540
Stacy.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.498
I gotta go, I'm late!

02:45.500 --> 02:46.708
How was your morning?

02:48.583 --> 02:49.625
Good, I guess.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.415
Same as always.

02:52.417 --> 02:53.915
With your grandma Betty?

02:53.917 --> 02:55.581
Yeah.

02:55.583 --> 02:58.998
Hey, she was already up
making us pancakes.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.875
I mean she enjoys it, so...

03:03.000 --> 03:04.581
More of a mother than my own.

03:04.583 --> 03:05.623
Sorry?

03:05.625 --> 03:06.750
Nothing, um&

03:07.875 --> 03:10.831
Tell me how are you sleeping?

03:10.833 --> 03:12.831
Are you still having
vivid dreams?

03:12.833 --> 03:14.540
Yeah.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.792
Uh, still the... the same faces.

03:18.375 --> 03:21.750
Like the... the same people in
and out of the circle.

03:23.708 --> 03:24.625
Those girls.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.833
It's blonde hair, I remember it.

03:30.167 --> 03:33.040
I don't know who they are,
but I... I have this feeling

03:33.042 --> 03:35.748
like they wanna communicate
with me.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.831
Have they spoken to you yet?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.540
No.

03:39.542 --> 03:42.456
Well, I mean not spoken
exactly, they...

03:42.458 --> 03:47.748
They pace forward,
and scream in my face,

03:47.750 --> 03:49.042
and then I wake up.

03:52.167 --> 03:53.875
And it's the same dream
over and over?

03:55.042 --> 03:57.540
Over and over, yeah.

03:57.542 --> 03:59.206
Hmm.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.873
I'd like you to start
writing down your thoughts,

04:01.875 --> 04:04.667
your dreams,
or you can think out loud.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.583
It's gonna help you
release your anxiety.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.040
Whatever is inside you,
you need to let it out

04:13.042 --> 04:15.040
instead of fighting it.

04:15.042 --> 04:16.540
I guess I could try.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.748
It might help you regain
your memories.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.081
- I don't know if I...
- It's going to be hard.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.206
I know you're scared
of what you'll remember,

04:24.208 --> 04:25.542
but it's imperative you try.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.415
Yeah.

04:28.417 --> 04:29.375
Good.

04:30.167 --> 04:31.915
Now, tell me

04:31.917 --> 04:33.500
what are you planning on doing
for the holidays?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.790
I don't know.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.542
Will you spend time
with your grandma?

04:40.167 --> 04:41.083
Of course.

04:42.083 --> 04:43.956
Uh, she... she lives with us.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.500
And how is Matt?

04:51.250 --> 04:52.125
He's good.

04:53.583 --> 04:54.958
I'm gonna meet him soon.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.623
And you think it could progress?

04:58.625 --> 05:03.040
I mean I like him,
like hey, it's not like he's

05:03.042 --> 05:05.748
like my boyfriend or anything,
you know?

05:05.750 --> 05:08.583
We're just gonna hang out

05:10.542 --> 05:13.708
and go with the flow I guess,
see what happens.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.081
And does he feel the same way?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.123
Ow!

05:17.125 --> 05:18.083
Are you okay?

05:18.958 --> 05:19.873
Oh, sorry.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.083
It's a bad habit.

05:22.875 --> 05:23.958
Hmm, well,

05:26.083 --> 05:27.750
let's continue this session
next week.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.165
Thanks.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.040
Hello, Stacy.

05:39.042 --> 05:40.581
Hey.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.706
Glad you're on time today.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.498
I've got so much to do
before the work event tonight.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.458
Yeah.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.206
Where am I droppin' you off?

05:59.208 --> 06:01.792
Um, the park is fine.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.206
I'm gonna meet Ems there.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.167
Okay.

06:07.833 --> 06:08.792
How was it?

06:09.833 --> 06:11.623
Well, I'm not actually supposed
to talk about it,

06:11.625 --> 06:12.625
but yeah, it was fine.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.831
What did you do to your finger?

06:16.833 --> 06:18.790
Oh, I just like caught
a bit of skin.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.165
Well, be careful, sweetie.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.833
It's just a small cut.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.081
Are the girls
still comin' over tonight?

06:26.042 --> 06:27.581
Yeah, of course.

06:27.583 --> 06:30.165
Well, uh,
Paula's not gonna be home,

06:30.167 --> 06:32.583
she's spending the night over
at Harper's.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.706
Okay, whatever.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.956
I'll be home,
but I won't bug you.

06:37.958 --> 06:39.248
Oh, I'm countin' on that.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.206
- Stacy.
- Sorry?

06:50.208 --> 06:52.040
Wish you'd get your head
out of the clouds.

06:52.042 --> 06:52.917
I didn't s...

06:54.833 --> 06:57.081
I cannot wait
to get my license back.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.542
Hmm, it's only temporary,
just until you feel better.

07:00.792 --> 07:02.167
I do feel better.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.581
I'm... I'm not dreaming anymore,
I'm not anxious.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.542
It's fine.
Like I... like I'm fine.

07:10.042 --> 07:11.206
Day by day.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.667
Counting them.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.373
Do you need a lift home?

07:17.375 --> 07:19.248
Nope, I'm good.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.165
Okay, well,
text when you get home,

07:20.167 --> 07:23.706
we might have already left
for the event.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.290
Oh.

07:25.292 --> 07:27.248
I just wish she'd talk to me.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.748
She will, love.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.915
Just give her time.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.415
Hey.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.373
Hey, baby.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.998
Come here.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.081
Mm.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.248
Still on for tonight?

07:47.250 --> 07:48.706
Yeah, of course.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.248
What about your parents?

07:50.250 --> 07:53.415
Oh, they're like away all night
at some work event.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.998
I don't know.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.706
You know,
it'll just be my grandma.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.040
Your grandma?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.790
Relax.

08:03.792 --> 08:04.915
Relax.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.040
Hmm.

08:07.042 --> 08:10.956
Yeah, she'll... she'll be asleep
by the time you get there.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.290
She goes to bed at like 7:00.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.708
Are you still coming?

08:16.792 --> 08:18.873
I suppose.

08:18.875 --> 08:22.040
Good,
because I really wanna see you.

08:22.042 --> 08:23.248
Mmhmm.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.373
That's cool.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.540
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

08:26.542 --> 08:31.873
Oh, is that... is that like a...
like a cool "yes", a cool "no".

08:31.875 --> 08:32.914
- Oh, pfft.
- Nah.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.873
Hey, come here.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.748
I'll be there.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.415
I gotta go.

08:47.417 --> 08:50.081
Hmm, wish you could stay longer.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.206
I know, I... I wanna spend time
with you, too,

08:52.208 --> 08:54.750
but I got a lot goin' on.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.165
It's okay.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.456
I understand.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.998
You know,
I like that about you, huh?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.331
- Hmm.
- Mmhmm.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.831
You're a cool girl, Stacy.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.373
Thanks.

09:08.375 --> 09:12.123
Okay, so I'm gonna
get a six-pack on the way there.

09:12.125 --> 09:13.790
How are you getting it?

09:13.792 --> 09:15.165
Just don't worry about that,
okay?

09:15.167 --> 09:16.331
I'll figure it out, yeah?

09:16.333 --> 09:17.831
Okay.

09:17.833 --> 09:18.998
Yeah, I'm in.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.042
Alright, cool.

09:32.542 --> 09:33.456
What?

09:33.458 --> 09:34.498
Oh, my God!

09:34.500 --> 09:36.165
Oh, my God!

09:36.167 --> 09:37.415
What?

09:37.417 --> 09:39.373
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.873
That was good timing.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.415
Was that Matt I just passed?

09:43.417 --> 09:45.081
Yeah.

09:45.083 --> 09:45.915
Okay.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.040
And?

09:47.042 --> 09:48.331
And what?

09:48.333 --> 09:49.748
I'm just curious.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.081
We were just talking.

09:51.083 --> 09:52.415
Okay.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.956
What are you doin' now?

09:54.958 --> 09:59.331
Um, I'm hanging out with Jess
and you are coming with us.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.040
Well,
I have to have a shower first.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.290
- Well, just shower at my house.
- Okay.

10:03.292 --> 10:05.123
You can like borrow my clothes,
it's gonna be cute.

10:05.125 --> 10:05.956
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:05.958 --> 10:08.040
Sounds good.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.040
We're gonna go?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.333
Yeah, um...

10:12.292 --> 10:13.873
Yeah, Jess is on her way, so...

10:13.875 --> 10:15.250
- Alrighty.
- Let's go.

10:17.833 --> 10:18.665
Hey, babe.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.915
Sup, Stace,
did you just see Matt?

10:20.917 --> 10:22.456
Yes, how did you know?

10:22.458 --> 10:24.498
Yeah, bitch, I know everything.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.081
Okay, you want pizza?

10:27.083 --> 10:29.123
Yeah, no fuckin' olives, okay?

10:29.125 --> 10:30.250
Yeah, I know.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.331
Did you find a towel?

10:39.333 --> 10:40.790
Yeah, I found one.

10:40.792 --> 10:41.833
Sick.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.498
Pizza.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.040
Thanks.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.373
D... did you leave
and then come back?

11:52.375 --> 11:54.956
Yeah, I left one of the pizzas
in the car.

11:54.958 --> 11:56.331
Literally, one job to do.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.623
Okay.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.081
Um, how much?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.373
24.99.

12:00.375 --> 12:01.833
Hmm.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.167
- Don't do it.
- What?

12:08.375 --> 12:10.498
Here's your change.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
Thanks.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.290
- You want some pizza?
- Mm.

12:20.292 --> 12:22.125
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

12:26.042 --> 12:28.248
So much better.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.373
- Did you save me some?
- No.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.415
Yeah, of course.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.165
- Hey...
- Oh.

12:32.167 --> 12:32.790
She's got it.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.290
- Mm, uh.
- That's fine.

12:34.292 --> 12:37.623
- You want this pizza?
- Mmhmm.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.915
Mmm.

12:39.917 --> 12:40.875
Mm.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.540
Your books?

12:46.542 --> 12:48.040
Hmm?

12:48.042 --> 12:50.206
Oh, no, my dad found
like a bunch of old books

12:50.208 --> 12:51.081
of my grandparents.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.956
Hmm.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.248
They haven't gotten around
to sorting through them yet,

12:54.250 --> 12:55.206
so...

12:55.208 --> 12:56.456
Is it okay if I check 'em out?

12:56.458 --> 12:58.081
Sure, go ahead.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.458
Cool.

13:02.417 --> 13:03.540
I'm gonna get something
to drink.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.248
You.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.081
Yeah, yeah?

13:06.083 --> 13:06.748
No, no?

13:06.750 --> 13:07.248
Alright.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.250
Yeah, yeah, alright.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.415
Hi, lovey.

13:22.417 --> 13:23.165
Hey.

13:23.167 --> 13:24.581
Having fun?

13:24.583 --> 13:26.917
Yeah, so good so far.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.123
Do you want some help?

13:31.125 --> 13:32.248
Oh, oh.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.290
No, I... I think I can manage.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.206
Oh, um...

13:37.208 --> 13:40.415
...my friend Matt
is gonna turn up around 10.

13:40.417 --> 13:43.623
Um, would you mind not to...

13:43.625 --> 13:44.706
Your mother?

13:48.083 --> 13:50.290
- Your secret's safe with me.
- Okay.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.081
I know what you did.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.123
Oh, my God!

13:55.125 --> 13:58.706
Did you...
did you just fall asleep?

13:59.417 --> 14:00.748
This night blows.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.290
Are you okay?

14:02.292 --> 14:05.040
Yeah, sorry, I crashed
for like five minutes, so...

14:05.042 --> 14:09.248
I just um, haven't been sleeping
a lot lately.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.208
I'm so bored.

14:20.458 --> 14:24.123
So what's happening with Matt?

14:24.125 --> 14:26.042
Did you kiss him?

14:27.208 --> 14:27.665
Yes.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.706
Did you fuck him?

14:29.833 --> 14:32.040
- Or what did you... did you...
- None of your business.

14:32.042 --> 14:33.290
What did you just say to me?

14:33.292 --> 14:34.373
It's none of
your fuckin' business!

14:34.375 --> 14:35.373
What... oh!
What?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.206
- Did you?
- Fuckin' business!

14:37.667 --> 14:39.665
Did you?

14:39.667 --> 14:42.165
No.

14:42.167 --> 14:44.123
We've only kissed.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.331
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.665
- I'm on to you.
- No, hey, no listen we...

14:48.667 --> 14:49.790
We haven't been hanging out
for that long.

14:49.792 --> 14:50.623
Oh.

14:50.625 --> 14:51.831
Like I...

14:51.833 --> 14:53.498
- no, I've told you this before.
- Have you?

14:53.500 --> 14:56.415
We um... we hooked up when I was
with Ems

14:56.417 --> 14:57.498
at that show a few weeks ago.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.123
You don't even know him
that well.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.081
I mean you haven't
really hung out with him.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.373
Yeah, a few times.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.123
I don't know,
I think he's super cool.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.331
Who cares?

15:06.333 --> 15:09.123
Is he coming here tonight?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.456
Later.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.081
After you leave.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.373
Oh.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.498
Is he keeping you all
to himself?

15:15.500 --> 15:16.706
Get off.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.123
He seems to make you smile
at least.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.208
Yeah, yeah.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.540
What's this?

15:29.542 --> 15:30.748
Check it out.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.081
What?

15:32.083 --> 15:33.456
It's a little note.

15:33.458 --> 15:37.790
Dated April 18, 1957!

15:37.792 --> 15:40.248
"X marks the spot
upon the ground,

15:40.250 --> 15:42.415
demonic box never to be found.

15:42.417 --> 15:43.915
Be sure not to make a sound.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.706
If resting spirits are awoken,

15:45.708 --> 15:50.540
your soul
will surely be broken."

15:50.542 --> 15:51.625
Weird.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.790
Where did your dad
find these books?

15:56.792 --> 16:00.665
Um, I... I think they were
under the stairs.

16:00.667 --> 16:05.373
Let's awaken the spirits!

16:05.375 --> 16:06.706
- Let's awaken the spirits!
- Come on, come on.

16:06.708 --> 16:07.915
Did you not hear what it said?

16:07.917 --> 16:09.706
Oh, you don't believe that shit.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.331
Paula probably put it there,
right?

16:11.333 --> 16:14.623
- She's a little weird.
- No, hey, no, she's not.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.373
And come on, Jess,
why would Paula put it there?

16:16.375 --> 16:20.331
It's dated in... in fuckin' 1957.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.790
And hold on, if you do the math,
you'd uh, wait...

16:23.792 --> 16:25.206
- Let's...
- Carry the one... no, she...

16:25.208 --> 16:26.373
- Find it.
- Wasn't born yet!

16:26.375 --> 16:28.748
Let's find it and then we can
find out for ourselves.

16:28.750 --> 16:29.790
Okay, I don't know,
I don't know.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.331
What if the note is genuine?

16:31.333 --> 16:32.623
I don't think we
should be messing with stuff.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.581
Yeah, Ems is right.

16:33.583 --> 16:36.290
Okay, give me the note.

16:37.167 --> 16:40.456
Here we go.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.290
Hey, guys, we are ghost hunting
in Stacy's house.

16:46.292 --> 16:47.665
Hey, hey, Jess,
that note is fragile.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.498
Is it?

16:50.625 --> 16:52.290
Has she always been
such a bitch?

16:52.292 --> 16:54.665
Yeah, since birth apparently.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.290
Yeah.

16:56.292 --> 16:57.790
Alrighty.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.665
What do we have here?

16:59.667 --> 17:00.873
Come on, Jess,
give the note back.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.665
- This is stupid.
- Is it?

17:04.666 --> 17:05.955
Probably doesn't
even exist anymore.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.748
I am not gonna stop
until I find it.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.915
Oh, she is so stubborn.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.915
Oh my God, you're gonna
have to do better than that.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.580
Are you worried
what I'm gonna find?

17:16.583 --> 17:17.750
Dammit, Jess.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.666
Hmm.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.831
Maybe it's her secret
porn collection.

17:30.833 --> 17:34.206
Okay, take... take the video.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.375
Goin' in.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.375
I found something.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.456
Whatever's in that box,

17:56.458 --> 17:58.208
I don't think you should
open it.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.790
Seriously?

18:09.792 --> 18:13.915
Ugh, such crap.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.748
Jess, get out of there.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.290
Okay, chill out.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.373
Get... get out of there now!

18:18.375 --> 18:21.540
Okay, Jesus, I'm comin' out.

18:21.542 --> 18:22.998
I swear this place is haunted.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.456
Boo!

18:24.458 --> 18:25.290
Oh my God!

18:25.292 --> 18:26.956
You bitch.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.623
Hmm.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.581
We are signing off.

18:47.833 --> 18:51.331
Hey, what's your problem?

18:51.333 --> 18:52.915
Nothing.

18:52.917 --> 18:56.081
Um, just...
just go watch a movie.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.583
Okay.

19:04.917 --> 19:06.665
So what movie are we watchin'?

19:06.667 --> 19:07.956
Huh?

19:07.958 --> 19:10.831
Uh, I don't know yet.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.498
Mmhmm, Matt.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.956
Shut up.

19:15.958 --> 19:18.331
So?

19:18.333 --> 19:21.123
He's on his way over.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.831
Okay, we get the hint.

19:23.833 --> 19:24.915
Oh, no, I didn't mean.

19:24.917 --> 19:25.998
No, it's... it's all good.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.956
You should spend time with him.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.665
You sure?

19:29.667 --> 19:32.123
I mean you can stay.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.706
Mmhmm.
Kinky.

19:37.958 --> 19:39.583
What's that?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.998
It's a photograph.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.498
Okay, that wasn't there earlier.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.123
Yeah, right, I know
you bitches put it there.

19:51.125 --> 19:52.831
We didn't.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.875
Must have fallen out
of the book.

19:56.917 --> 20:00.123
Actually, can I um,
talk to you about something?

20:00.125 --> 20:02.333
Yeah, I just...
I need to get it off my chest.

20:05.667 --> 20:06.831
Don't tease me, okay?

20:06.833 --> 20:09.373
I promise.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.831
Jess?

20:10.833 --> 20:12.998
- Jess?
- Mmhmm, yeah, sure.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.748
Okay, um...

20:15.750 --> 20:24.831
Recently, uh, I've been having
these visions.

20:24.833 --> 20:30.623
Girls have been appearing
in my dreams.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.873
Young girls.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.081
Sisters.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.665
Jess.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.206
I'm sorry.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.998
These are those girls.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.706
You've never seen that before?

20:41.708 --> 20:43.123
No, and it's actually startin'
to freak me out.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.665
I... I feel like I'm going crazy
or something

20:45.667 --> 20:48.456
and I... I don't know what to do.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.542
You haven't told anyone yet?

20:53.708 --> 20:59.206
Why don't you contact them?

20:59.208 --> 21:00.790
What?

21:00.792 --> 21:02.206
Like a séance?

21:02.208 --> 21:03.581
Yeah, sorta.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.956
I heard some girls talking
about an app

21:05.958 --> 21:07.873
that you can use
to connect with the dead,

21:07.875 --> 21:10.790
it's kind of cool.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.165
Let's do it.

21:12.167 --> 21:13.540
How do you know what's real
and what's bullshit?

21:13.542 --> 21:14.956
Okay, well, you have to try.

21:14.958 --> 21:16.081
Yeah, actually, I...

21:16.083 --> 21:19.581
I saw something in the paper
this morning about apps.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.748
I don't think we should do this,
okay?

21:21.750 --> 21:24.040
They can really screw people up.

21:24.042 --> 21:27.623
Throughout history,
people have had bad experiences.

21:27.625 --> 21:28.748
I don't know.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.831
It's just a known fact
not to mess with that stuff.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.498
- Chill.
- Hmm, there's a few.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.498
Oh, yes, that one.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.831
9.99?

21:35.833 --> 21:36.831
Are you joking?

21:37.875 --> 21:40.206
Um, no, there's a free one.

21:40.208 --> 21:42.748
Oh, um, yeah,
this one's got good reviews.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.665
It says it's already downloaded.

21:45.667 --> 21:46.790
It's weird.

21:46.792 --> 21:49.956
My... my finger
must have pressed it.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.792
Hmm, let's start it.

22:00.792 --> 22:02.125
Let me see.

22:09.542 --> 22:10.623
I'm...
I'm gonna ask it a question.

22:10.625 --> 22:11.708
Go for it.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.623
Turned off.

22:18.625 --> 22:19.623
Okay, it's your battery.

22:19.625 --> 22:20.873
No, I just charged it.

22:29.292 --> 22:31.042
It's ready.

22:36.792 --> 22:40.123
What is that?

22:40.125 --> 22:41.540
- Oh my God... ew!
- Ugh!

22:41.542 --> 22:42.831
Ew, make it stop!

22:42.833 --> 22:43.956
I can't, it's stuck.

23:01.333 --> 23:03.290
Okay, okay,
this is way too freaky for me.

23:03.292 --> 23:05.998
What does it mean?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.540
Ugh, I don't know.

23:07.542 --> 23:08.665
Okay, maybe we should stop.

23:08.667 --> 23:09.873
Can we just hold on
a little longer?

23:09.875 --> 23:11.000
Yeah, I'm with Stace.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.665
It's moving again.

23:17.667 --> 23:19.500
Ask your question.

23:23.708 --> 23:25.542
Who are the girls in my dreams?

23:27.583 --> 23:29.542
What do they want?

23:43.250 --> 23:44.708
Fuck!

23:48.708 --> 23:50.123
I'm out of this.

23:50.125 --> 23:53.290
Is there a window open?

23:53.292 --> 23:54.290
- Is there?
- No.

23:54.292 --> 23:55.081
Oh!

23:55.875 --> 23:56.873
Oh my God.

23:58.292 --> 23:59.748
Getting out right now!

23:59.750 --> 24:01.748
Oh my God, we're all gonna die!

24:05.750 --> 24:07.206
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi.

24:07.208 --> 24:08.248
Oh, hi.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.248
Oh, hi.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.206
Is uh, Stace in there?

24:11.208 --> 24:12.917
Yeah, come on in.

24:21.083 --> 24:22.958
Oh, alright.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.665
You okay?

24:28.667 --> 24:30.873
Yeah.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.331
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.415
Matt's here.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.040
Oh.

24:35.042 --> 24:37.248
Look, who I found.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.081
Take him away.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.790
Sorry, the wait...
picture frame fell out.

24:42.792 --> 24:43.873
You made it.

24:44.792 --> 24:46.665
And that's our cue to leave.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.248
Hey, I have to go.

24:52.250 --> 24:52.875
See you.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.208
Bye.

25:04.375 --> 25:05.790
Come on, babe.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.167
Come on.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.998
Come on, baby,
let's go upstairs, huh?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.123
I've been waiting a long time
for this.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.248
Soon, okay?

25:20.250 --> 25:22.956
Let's just like stay here
for a while.

25:22.958 --> 25:24.875
I'm gonna put a movie on.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.667
- You know, you drive me crazy?
- Yeah.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.290
Um.

25:45.292 --> 25:46.206
Mm, mm.

25:46.208 --> 25:47.831
Nah, nah-huh.

25:47.833 --> 25:49.498
Oh, oh.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.415
Mm.

25:52.417 --> 25:54.706
Like I thought
we were just gonna like...

25:54.708 --> 25:57.040
Like chill for a bit.

25:57.042 --> 26:00.831
Don't you uh, want to...

26:00.833 --> 26:02.083
Of course.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.792
Okay, you know what?

26:08.542 --> 26:10.333
- Oh.
- Mmhmm.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.873
What... uh,
what happened to the beers?

26:14.875 --> 26:16.040
I improvised.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.498
- Oh, okay.
- Just try it.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.875
Um...

26:21.542 --> 26:23.123
Oh.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.373
That's cute.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.040
- This is cute?
- Mmhmm.

26:27.042 --> 26:28.750
- Oh, is it cute?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.498
Okay.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.540
Oh.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.123
Oh, oh, what a man.

26:36.125 --> 26:37.040
Yeah-huh.

26:37.042 --> 26:38.123
Oh, he's such a man.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.498
Yeah, your turn.

26:39.500 --> 26:40.831
I'm a man, too.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.373
- Uh-huh, let's see it.
- Mm.

26:42.375 --> 26:43.498
- Uh-huh.
- Mm.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.167
- It's not fucking fair, Matt!
- You...

26:53.292 --> 26:56.875
Oh, okay, you there.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.917
Hmm.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.917
- Mm-mm.
- Mm, mm.

27:11.333 --> 27:14.831
Baby, let's go upstairs, huh?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.000
Baby, come on.

27:18.417 --> 27:20.206
- Hey, I got you.
- Hmm?

27:20.208 --> 27:21.415
Let's go.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.873
Okay?

27:23.875 --> 27:25.290
I got you.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.206
Matt?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.375
Yeah, it's me, babe.

28:16.125 --> 28:17.458
Come on, wake up, babe.

28:19.458 --> 28:21.998
Wait, what are you doing?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.915
Hey, hey, it's okay.

28:23.917 --> 28:25.333
Relax, it's okay.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.623
I don't feel good.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.415
Matt, I want to sleep.

28:32.417 --> 28:34.915
- Matt, don't!
- Oh, come on.

28:34.917 --> 28:36.498
- Come on.
- No, don't!

28:36.500 --> 28:38.498
Fuck!

29:59.500 --> 30:00.665
Grandma's sleeping.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.248
This is fucked.

30:08.417 --> 30:09.998
What are you doing?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.081
Upstairs.

30:41.542 --> 30:44.081
Bro, she's kinda hot.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.456
Shut the fuck up, man.

30:46.458 --> 30:47.456
Dumbass.

30:47.458 --> 30:48.500
What?

30:52.417 --> 30:54.790
Just write on the bitch.

30:54.792 --> 30:56.623
I'm gonna have some fun
with her.

30:56.625 --> 30:58.125
Your fuckin' turn, huh?

31:01.500 --> 31:02.415
After you, DaVinci.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.667
Come on.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.748
Stacy.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.708
Stacy, dear, wake up.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.456
Grandma.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.748
I brought
you a nice hot cup of tea.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.165
How are you feeling?

32:31.167 --> 32:35.375
Um, better.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.165
I'm afraid I've
gotten some bad news for you.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.873
What?

32:41.875 --> 32:43.706
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man.

32:43.708 --> 32:46.248
Bake me a cake
as fast as you can.

32:46.250 --> 32:47.581
Pat it, prick it,
mark it with a B.

32:47.583 --> 32:48.748
Stop!

32:48.750 --> 32:51.123
Put it in the oven
for Baby and me.

32:51.125 --> 32:52.873
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake,
baker's man.

32:52.875 --> 32:54.873
Stop!

32:54.875 --> 32:55.790
Stop!

33:10.250 --> 33:12.290
I don't know
what I'm gonna do with her.

33:12.292 --> 33:13.540
I mean, look, it's a mess.

33:13.542 --> 33:14.873
Yeah.

33:16.833 --> 33:19.623
Well, go easy on her.

33:19.625 --> 33:23.540
No, she needs to learn, Bob,
she's not a child anymore.

33:23.542 --> 33:26.831
There's a way that
you need to talk to her.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.290
Easy for you to say,

33:28.292 --> 33:31.373
'cause I'm always
the bad person.

33:31.375 --> 33:32.708
Oh, hey, sport.

33:34.625 --> 33:35.498
Yeah.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.248
No!

33:37.250 --> 33:39.165
Use a glass.

33:39.167 --> 33:41.581
Fine.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.790
How was your evening?

33:43.792 --> 33:45.750
Uh, it's alright.

33:47.417 --> 33:49.331
When'd you guys get back?

33:49.333 --> 33:51.250
Uh, early this mornin'.

33:54.417 --> 33:55.581
How was it?

33:55.583 --> 33:57.706
Oh, it's great.

33:57.708 --> 34:00.748
It was really nice seein'
the old team again, you know?

34:00.750 --> 34:01.790
How are you doin', sport?

34:01.792 --> 34:03.665
You good?

34:03.667 --> 34:05.748
Why are you guys up so early?

34:05.750 --> 34:09.290
Stacy,
it's 1:00 in the afternoon.

34:09.292 --> 34:10.998
Shit.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.623
I gotta go meet the girls.

34:13.625 --> 34:17.290
Um, young lady, uh, we... we...

34:17.292 --> 34:19.706
It'd be great uh,
to spend some...

34:19.708 --> 34:21.623
And we need a word later.

34:21.625 --> 34:24.542
I was not impressed coming back
to find my home in a mess!

34:37.500 --> 34:39.873
Did you hear about, Stacy?

34:39.875 --> 34:41.373
No, what happened?

34:41.375 --> 34:45.706
Matt told me she sent him nudes.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.290
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

34:47.292 --> 34:48.373
Who would've thought
our little Stace

34:48.375 --> 34:50.540
was such a tease.

34:50.542 --> 34:53.873
Doesn't sound like Stace.

34:53.875 --> 34:56.248
Why are you talking to Matt?

34:56.250 --> 34:57.706
We have friends in common.

34:57.708 --> 35:00.373
Since when?
He just moved here.

35:00.375 --> 35:01.625
Does it matter?

35:09.958 --> 35:11.583
Check this out.

35:15.042 --> 35:17.498
Did he write on her?

35:17.500 --> 35:18.665
That's fucked up!

35:20.083 --> 35:21.831
Dammit.

35:21.833 --> 35:25.415
I knew something
wasn't right with him.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.748
Does she know about this?

35:26.750 --> 35:30.415
She's read her messages
or seen her body.

35:30.417 --> 35:31.665
Oh shit.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.873
What the fuck.

36:15.792 --> 36:17.331
Stace, Jess just told me.

36:18.625 --> 36:19.790
Tell me you didn't.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.706
Ems, I swear.

36:21.708 --> 36:22.956
Where are you now?

36:22.958 --> 36:24.956
Um, my bedroom.

36:24.958 --> 36:26.623
Okay, come to my house.

36:26.625 --> 36:27.956
We can talk about it, okay?

36:27.958 --> 36:29.792
Yeah, be there soon.

36:36.875 --> 36:40.665
I got you a flower.

36:40.667 --> 36:41.915
What do you want from me?

36:41.917 --> 36:42.915
Do you want it?

36:44.750 --> 36:46.165
Who are you?

36:46.167 --> 36:47.498
Abigail.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.081
Moira.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.915
Play the game.

36:52.917 --> 36:57.998
Stacy,
we can make the pain go away.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.123
How do you know my name?

37:00.125 --> 37:02.165
Betty told us.

37:02.167 --> 37:03.790
Betty.

37:03.792 --> 37:04.873
Your grandma.

37:04.875 --> 37:06.498
What?

37:06.500 --> 37:07.500
Where is she?

37:12.917 --> 37:14.667
- I missed you.
- Hi.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.123
- Have you been crying?
- No, I'm just tired.

37:18.125 --> 37:21.623
- Um, how was your night?
- Fun.

37:21.625 --> 37:23.831
We went to the movies.

37:23.833 --> 37:25.498
- What's that?
- Nothing.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.706
Um, I'm gonna go shower.

37:27.708 --> 37:29.706
Uh, I'll meet you downstairs,
okay?

37:29.708 --> 37:30.917
Yeah.

38:42.667 --> 38:43.873
...is such a creep.

38:43.875 --> 38:45.665
Like I swear he actually spends
more time staring at us

38:45.667 --> 38:46.790
than at the road.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.790
I hate that, but I don't know,
man, he's so annoying.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.540
I believe that,
I believe it this time, man.

38:50.542 --> 38:51.998
- Yeah.
- That guy's a fucking creep.

38:53.792 --> 38:54.956
Matt!

38:54.958 --> 38:55.873
Shit, here she comes.

38:55.875 --> 38:56.790
Oh, hey, baby.

38:56.792 --> 38:57.790
- Oh-oh.
- Hey, babe.

38:57.792 --> 38:58.998
What the fuck is wrong with you?

38:59.000 --> 39:00.956
Oh, what are you talking about?

39:00.958 --> 39:03.790
I... I can't believe
you took photos of me like that

39:03.792 --> 39:04.915
and...

39:05.792 --> 39:06.998
Look, just...
just chill out, okay baby?

39:07.000 --> 39:07.831
- Matt.
- Hmm.

39:07.833 --> 39:09.706
I was unconscious.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.581
You don't remember asking me
to take those pics for you, hmm?

39:11.583 --> 39:12.665
You were so thirsty.

39:12.667 --> 39:13.623
Shut up!

39:13.625 --> 39:14.790
Who the fuck are you?

39:14.792 --> 39:16.956
Oh, okay.

39:16.958 --> 39:18.623
No, you... you wrote on me.

39:18.625 --> 39:19.706
Uh-huh.

39:19.708 --> 39:22.790
And then you sent pictures
to Jess.

39:22.792 --> 39:23.956
I didn't just send them to Jess.

39:23.958 --> 39:25.165
He sent 'em to a lot of people.

39:25.167 --> 39:26.706
A lot of people.

39:26.708 --> 39:28.165
What?

39:28.167 --> 39:29.248
Why are you doing this?

39:29.250 --> 39:31.248
Look, just fucking...
just calm down, okay, Stacy?

39:31.250 --> 39:32.748
- You look fine.
- You're disgusting.

39:32.750 --> 39:33.623
Oh, shit.

39:33.625 --> 39:34.665
Oh, shit,
this bitch is fuckin' nuts!

39:34.667 --> 39:36.123
Look, don't you fuckin'
touch me again, alright?

39:36.125 --> 39:37.915
- I hate you.
- Yo!

39:37.917 --> 39:40.165
Wa..., yo, where you goin'?

39:41.042 --> 39:42.290
Fuckin' slut.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.998
Hey, this shit's goin'
fuckin' viral!

39:44.000 --> 39:45.665
Don't stick your dick in crazy,
motherfuckers!

39:53.333 --> 39:55.748
It was Stacy.

39:55.750 --> 39:56.915
She's on her way over.

39:56.917 --> 39:58.581
Seemed really upset.

39:58.583 --> 40:01.706
Yeah, well,
she shouldn't have taken nudes.

40:01.708 --> 40:02.956
How do you know she took them?

40:02.958 --> 40:04.123
Come on.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.165
You know, she hasn't been
acting right since you know...

40:06.167 --> 40:07.706
It doesn't mean she'd do it.

40:07.708 --> 40:10.998
Haven't you seen her talking
to herself,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.873
staring into a daze?

40:13.875 --> 40:15.206
I guess.

40:15.208 --> 40:18.125
She's not right.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.000
Hey.

40:29.625 --> 40:32.581
I... I ran into him...
I just ran...

40:34.042 --> 40:34.873
Where?

40:37.917 --> 40:39.206
On... on the way here.

40:42.958 --> 40:44.956
He denied everything.

40:44.958 --> 40:46.706
Oh.

40:46.708 --> 40:48.290
I just... I...
I didn't think he was like that.

40:49.417 --> 40:50.873
So stupid.

40:50.875 --> 40:52.623
Such an asshole.

40:55.125 --> 40:57.165
Did you get the ink off?

40:57.167 --> 40:58.956
Yeah.

40:58.958 --> 40:59.917
Most of it.

41:01.708 --> 41:03.998
Stacy, I think we need to go
to the police.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.998
No.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.248
No, I don't want my parents
finding out.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.248
You can't...
you can't think like that.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.331
I mean what he did,
that is so messed up.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.081
- Do you even remember it?
- No.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.415
Then, how do you know
you didn't pose?

41:14.417 --> 41:16.250
- Jesus, Jess!
- What the fuck?

41:19.250 --> 41:20.706
You're unbelievable.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.748
Shit,
Stacy you look crazy in this.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.290
Oh, and another one.

41:28.292 --> 41:30.206
Another one.

41:30.208 --> 41:32.123
Full frontal.

41:32.125 --> 41:35.081
- What?
- Jesus.

41:35.083 --> 41:36.956
Why is Matt sending them to you?

41:36.958 --> 41:38.706
You barely know him?

41:38.708 --> 41:41.081
Who else is he sending them to?

41:41.083 --> 41:42.956
Dead.

41:42.958 --> 41:43.748
If you don't tell me,

41:43.750 --> 41:44.915
I'm gonna
smash your goddamn phone.

41:44.917 --> 41:46.748
Okay, what are you doing?

41:46.750 --> 41:49.456
What kind of girl sends nudes
to a guy she barely knows?

41:49.458 --> 41:50.956
I didn't.

41:50.958 --> 41:52.998
Jess, like I said,
I was fuckin' passed out!

41:53.000 --> 41:54.040
- Stacy, calm down.
- Oh, yeah.

41:54.042 --> 41:55.123
She is crazy!

41:55.125 --> 41:56.831
I told you.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.206
No, you know what?
You started this!

41:58.208 --> 41:59.081
Okay?

41:59.083 --> 42:00.123
You keep pushing her.

42:00.125 --> 42:03.040
You know exactly
what you're doing.

42:03.042 --> 42:05.040
Just ignore her.

42:05.042 --> 42:08.081
It's the game.

42:08.083 --> 42:09.831
Right, it has to be.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.790
Like why else would all this...

42:11.792 --> 42:14.250
This bad shit be happening
to me?

42:16.083 --> 42:16.831
Those girls.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.873
The same girls from last night?

42:18.875 --> 42:20.706
Yeah.

42:20.708 --> 42:22.831
They keep following me.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.706
They um, they told me

42:24.708 --> 42:28.498
their names were Moira
and Abigail.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.706
Yeah.

42:30.708 --> 42:32.831
Stace?

42:32.833 --> 42:35.498
It wasn't the first time
I've used it.

42:35.500 --> 42:38.248
What?

42:38.250 --> 42:40.208
I... I know you think I'm crazy.

42:42.792 --> 42:45.206
But explain these.

42:45.208 --> 42:46.873
- Oh, my God.
- What are they?

42:46.875 --> 42:51.498
This morning in the shower,
they were there.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.206
They... they grabbed my waist
and disappeared.

42:53.208 --> 42:55.081
- No, it was Paula.
- It wasn't Paula!

42:57.125 --> 42:59.415
Something is happenin' to me.

43:02.250 --> 43:04.040
I can't.

43:05.208 --> 43:08.206
I can't, it's too much.

43:08.208 --> 43:10.000
Stacy,
you're starting to scare me.

43:12.417 --> 43:16.248
This morning, I deleted the app
and look,

43:16.250 --> 43:18.040
it's back on my phone again.

43:18.042 --> 43:21.248
I need to end this.

43:21.250 --> 43:22.748
- No.
- Please.

43:22.750 --> 43:23.873
Okay,
I'm not messing with that again.

43:23.875 --> 43:26.956
Please, please, please!

43:26.958 --> 43:28.292
They won't go away.

43:30.208 --> 43:31.375
I don't want them to know.

43:33.542 --> 43:34.458
Okay.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.083
If you think it'll help.

43:41.042 --> 43:42.042
Jess?

43:47.083 --> 43:49.331
Why should I...

43:49.333 --> 43:52.081
Because she's your friend.

43:52.083 --> 43:53.417
You need to do this.

43:56.417 --> 43:58.081
Fine.

43:58.083 --> 44:00.415
Okay.

44:00.417 --> 44:03.375
Um, I'll meet you
at my house 8:00 pm.

44:05.542 --> 44:09.081
We'll be there.

44:09.083 --> 44:10.373
Just call me
if you need me, okay?

44:10.375 --> 44:11.917
Thanks.

44:18.333 --> 44:21.956
I thought I'd find you here.

44:21.958 --> 44:25.081
What's the matter, lovey?

44:25.083 --> 44:27.456
It's Matt.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.956
I don't feel comfortable
telling you, actually.

44:29.958 --> 44:33.290
He took those photos, didn't he?

44:33.292 --> 44:35.581
What?

44:35.583 --> 44:37.123
How do you...

44:39.167 --> 44:40.415
Does mom know?

44:40.417 --> 44:43.373
Not yet at least.

44:43.375 --> 44:47.081
I overheard you talking
to your friends.

44:47.083 --> 44:52.373
It's not fair.

44:52.375 --> 44:56.415
Like h... how can he just...
just do that to me?

44:56.417 --> 44:58.998
Like I... I trusted him.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.248
We don't always see someone's
true colours at first glance.

45:03.250 --> 45:04.956
Forget him, sweetheart.

45:04.958 --> 45:09.248
You're better than this.

45:09.250 --> 45:12.998
You always seem to...

45:13.000 --> 45:15.581
...define me when I'm lost.

45:15.583 --> 45:19.040
I'll always be here for you,
Stacy.

45:19.042 --> 45:21.415
You know that.

45:21.417 --> 45:22.665
I am so scared.

45:22.667 --> 45:25.873
Oh, don't be, lovey.

45:25.875 --> 45:28.873
Come on,
let's get you home, hmm?

45:37.917 --> 45:39.498
Where'd that girl get to?

45:39.500 --> 45:42.415
I've just about had it with her.

45:42.417 --> 45:45.581
And I asked you
not to be too harsh on her.

45:45.583 --> 45:47.540
Oh, here we go again.

45:47.542 --> 45:49.123
Good cop, bad cop.

45:49.125 --> 45:50.206
Guess which one I am.

45:50.208 --> 45:52.040
Oh, Jesus, Marge!

45:52.042 --> 45:53.165
I'm just lookin'
for a little peace

45:53.167 --> 45:54.498
and quiet around here,

45:54.500 --> 45:57.540
not listen
to arguing all day long.

45:57.542 --> 46:00.998
Is that too much to ask?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.373
Paula eat properly,

46:02.375 --> 46:04.040
your dinner isn't
to be played with.

46:04.042 --> 46:05.958
I don't feel hungry!

46:09.083 --> 46:12.373
Jesus, Marge.

46:12.375 --> 46:13.540
Leave her alone.

46:13.542 --> 46:16.456
Oh, great.

46:16.458 --> 46:19.665
Now, you're goin' on at me
about Paula as well.

46:19.667 --> 46:21.581
Do you want me
to parent the girls

46:21.583 --> 46:23.290
or just be a pushover?

46:23.292 --> 46:28.081
Oh, I would like a little piece
of quiet around here.

46:28.083 --> 46:29.458
Is that too much to ask?

46:34.250 --> 46:38.623
Paula,
have a few more mouthfuls.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.540
Okay?

46:40.542 --> 46:41.581
Okay.

46:41.583 --> 46:42.625
Thank you.

46:46.708 --> 46:48.333
You happy now?

46:54.500 --> 46:56.583
What the hell was that?

46:58.292 --> 46:59.375
Stacy!

47:03.583 --> 47:05.292
Stacy!

47:39.500 --> 47:45.415
I use this sage to heal,

47:45.417 --> 47:47.125
to cleanse me.

47:49.500 --> 47:52.415
To clear away the evil spirits
that surround me.

47:52.417 --> 47:53.498
I...

47:53.500 --> 47:54.706
- Stacy.
- Shit, um...

47:54.708 --> 47:55.623
I'm coming in.

47:55.625 --> 47:57.000
Just a sec!

48:07.708 --> 48:11.373
What's goin' on with you?

48:11.375 --> 48:13.706
What's that smell?

48:13.708 --> 48:14.831
Have you been smoking weed
in here?

48:14.833 --> 48:16.706
No, of course, not I...

48:18.167 --> 48:21.373
I was burning sage.

48:21.375 --> 48:22.290
Sage?

48:22.292 --> 48:23.373
Mmhmm.

48:23.375 --> 48:24.373
Hmm.

48:24.375 --> 48:25.540
Where'd you get that from?

48:25.542 --> 48:27.165
Uh, from Ems.

48:27.167 --> 48:28.873
She... she thought it would
help calm me

48:28.875 --> 48:33.873
and like cleanse the air.

48:33.875 --> 48:35.081
Cleanse the air?

48:35.083 --> 48:38.123
Hmm.

48:38.125 --> 48:40.873
Okay, well, uh,
don't go burning it downstairs.

48:40.875 --> 48:42.542
It smells disgusting.

48:45.208 --> 48:46.665
I don't know
what's been going on with you,

48:46.667 --> 48:50.373
but lately,
I feel like I hardly know you.

48:50.375 --> 48:52.623
I mean the attitude,
sneaking around,

48:52.625 --> 48:55.206
not to mention
how awful you look.

48:55.208 --> 48:57.540
Are you even eating?

48:57.542 --> 48:59.206
Thanks.

49:00.250 --> 49:02.583
I can always count on you
to make me feel better.

49:04.333 --> 49:06.165
I'm sorry, I...

49:06.167 --> 49:07.290
It's just that this isn't you,
Stacy.

49:07.292 --> 49:10.831
I've had a rough few days, okay?

49:10.833 --> 49:12.623
I really wish
you could talk to me.

49:12.625 --> 49:15.665
Isn't that why you're sending me
to a therapist?

49:15.667 --> 49:18.248
- It's for your own good.
- Are we done?

49:18.250 --> 49:21.581
I... I need to get my room ready.

49:21.583 --> 49:24.165
The girls are coming over
tonight.

49:24.167 --> 49:25.165
Later.

49:25.167 --> 49:27.248
Uh...

49:27.250 --> 49:29.290
I really wish
you'd give me more notice.

49:29.292 --> 49:30.415
Why can't they come
another night?

49:30.417 --> 49:33.540
I'd really like to spend time,
just us.

49:33.542 --> 49:35.248
Oh, really?

49:35.250 --> 49:38.331
Yeah, a family night?

49:38.333 --> 49:40.373
Since when is
that important to you?

49:40.375 --> 49:42.456
I'm trying.

49:42.458 --> 49:46.290
Well, I made other plans.

49:46.292 --> 49:48.915
Unless you'd rather we go
somewhere else.

49:48.917 --> 49:52.623
Fine, um,
but keep the noise down

49:52.625 --> 49:55.415
and not too late tonight,
please.

49:55.417 --> 49:57.792
You really need to rest.

49:59.375 --> 50:02.875
Oh, and uh, this time,
clean up after yourselves.

50:16.708 --> 50:18.456
Stace?

50:18.458 --> 50:20.706
Come in!

50:20.708 --> 50:22.248
Sorry, we're late.

50:22.250 --> 50:23.831
I had practice.

50:23.833 --> 50:25.831
Wow!

50:25.833 --> 50:27.456
Really goin' full out.

50:27.458 --> 50:29.665
Hey, can you close the door?

50:29.667 --> 50:30.873
Yeah, quick,
I don't want my mom to see.

50:30.875 --> 50:31.706
Okay.

50:31.708 --> 50:33.331
Do you know
how long this will be?

50:33.333 --> 50:34.706
I have a date.

50:34.708 --> 50:35.831
With who?

50:35.833 --> 50:37.665
Some guy.

50:37.667 --> 50:39.498
Why didn't you
tell me about this guy?

50:39.500 --> 50:40.540
I don't know.
I barely know him.

50:40.542 --> 50:43.331
Okay, can we do this?

50:57.500 --> 51:02.831
Spirits, hear my cry.

51:02.833 --> 51:08.540
I summon you
from the other side.

51:08.542 --> 51:12.540
I command you
to make them go away.

51:12.542 --> 51:16.623
Please, make it stop.

51:16.625 --> 51:18.706
No more visions.

51:18.708 --> 51:21.790
Stacy, dear,
what are you doing?

51:21.792 --> 51:23.873
It's okay, grandma.

51:23.875 --> 51:25.915
I... I need to do this.

51:25.917 --> 51:28.706
No, this isn't right.

51:28.708 --> 51:33.706
You need to stop playing
with this game, please.

51:33.708 --> 51:36.915
This is for real.

51:36.917 --> 51:39.373
Please, grandma,
it'll only take a second.

51:39.375 --> 51:41.498
I can't stop them anymore.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.373
They're coming.

51:43.375 --> 51:45.456
It's all my fault.

51:45.458 --> 51:47.456
I'm sorry, love.

51:47.458 --> 51:50.040
Who's coming?

51:50.042 --> 51:52.790
Stacy, are you talking to...

51:52.792 --> 51:54.790
Grandma Betty.

51:56.750 --> 51:59.581
She's been dead for over a year.

51:59.583 --> 52:02.373
No.

52:02.375 --> 52:03.456
No, she's still here.

52:03.458 --> 52:04.790
Okay.

52:04.792 --> 52:08.250
Okay, you're freaking me out
and I am out of here.

52:14.292 --> 52:16.000
Stacy, what is going on?

52:28.292 --> 52:32.998
Let me out!

52:59.125 --> 53:01.042
Grandma Betty was bad.

53:02.458 --> 53:03.958
Now, we claim you.

53:17.542 --> 53:20.333
Stacy, stop.

53:23.583 --> 53:25.790
Let me out! Let me out!

53:25.792 --> 53:28.165
What...
What's going on in there?

53:28.167 --> 53:30.623
Open this door right now!

53:33.625 --> 53:35.998
Bob, call 911.

54:10.792 --> 54:12.748
Stop!

54:12.750 --> 54:15.831
Stacy, stop!

54:17.875 --> 54:19.040
Stop!

54:32.458 --> 54:33.998
What's happening?

54:35.875 --> 54:37.873
We need help!

54:37.875 --> 54:41.081
Help us.

54:43.750 --> 54:45.915
Help us!

54:45.917 --> 54:46.873
Sir, what's goin' on?

54:46.875 --> 54:48.123
It's my daughter Stacy!

54:48.125 --> 54:51.000
There's a lot of constant noise,
we can't get inside the door.

54:54.917 --> 54:56.998
Ma'am, Stacy,
this is the police.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.540
Open the door now!

54:58.542 --> 54:59.790
Open the door now!

54:59.792 --> 55:01.123
- Sir, wait.
- Stacy!

55:01.917 --> 55:03.456
- Bob.
- Sir, stay back.

55:03.458 --> 55:04.790
- Go on. Stop!
- Bob, just stop it.

55:04.792 --> 55:07.040
- Let them do their jobs.
- Sir, just calm down.

55:07.042 --> 55:08.623
Officers are gonna take care
of this, alright?

55:08.625 --> 55:09.748
Help!

55:09.750 --> 55:12.540
Help!

55:16.458 --> 55:17.081
What are they doin'?

55:17.083 --> 55:18.081
What happened?

55:18.083 --> 55:19.248
What's going on?

55:19.250 --> 55:20.706
Hey, alright, alright.

55:20.708 --> 55:21.498
- Stacy!
- Hold it.

55:21.500 --> 55:22.748
Okay, let's go, let's go,
let's go!

55:22.750 --> 55:24.123
Stacy!
No!

55:24.125 --> 55:26.165
No, I'm not going
without my daughter.

55:26.167 --> 55:28.081
No, no!

55:28.083 --> 55:29.706
No, I'm not going
without my daughter!

55:29.708 --> 55:30.873
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to go downstairs!

55:30.875 --> 55:31.998
I'm not going without her!

55:32.000 --> 55:33.748
- Ma'am, please.
- No.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.790
Let's let the police take care
of it, okay?

55:35.792 --> 55:37.873
Let the police do their job,
okay?

55:37.875 --> 55:39.748
Listen, let's go downstairs,
talk to the girls,

55:39.750 --> 55:41.248
see what they know.

55:41.250 --> 55:42.790
Mom?

55:42.792 --> 55:45.165
Oh, downstairs, honey.

55:45.167 --> 55:46.581
Downstairs.

55:46.583 --> 55:47.581
Let's go downstairs okay, Paula?

55:47.583 --> 55:48.623
Yeah, let's go.

55:48.625 --> 55:49.581
But what's goin' on?
Where's Stacy?

55:49.583 --> 55:50.498
No, no, no, no!

55:50.500 --> 55:51.581
She's gonna be okay, alright?

55:51.583 --> 55:52.456
Just go downstairs, honey.

55:52.458 --> 55:54.040
Come on, let's go downstairs.
Let's go.

55:54.042 --> 55:56.125
The police are doing
everything they can.

56:05.292 --> 56:06.998
They'll kill me.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.581
Mmhmm.

56:08.583 --> 56:11.165
Stacy, we're here to help you.

56:11.167 --> 56:14.748
Stacy, we're gonna need you
to slowly come off the bed.

56:21.542 --> 56:22.623
Stacy we just gotta...

56:22.625 --> 56:23.833
Oh, my God.

56:26.750 --> 56:28.748
I'm sorry.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.873
What happened?

56:30.875 --> 56:32.873
We just wanna get you
to the hospital.

56:35.292 --> 56:36.667
Okay.

56:47.375 --> 56:50.623
What are they gonna do to her?

56:50.625 --> 56:54.206
I'm scared.

56:54.208 --> 56:56.706
It's okay, Paula

56:56.708 --> 56:59.831
She's gonna be alright.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.125
She's gonna be okay.

57:08.375 --> 57:10.208
It's okay.

57:25.833 --> 57:28.956
Is this what you want?

57:28.958 --> 57:32.373
No, Stacy, please,
we just need you to stay still.

57:32.375 --> 57:36.081
I love a man in uniform.

57:36.083 --> 57:38.915
Shall we play?

57:38.917 --> 57:41.206
K... k... k... k... k...
keep your hands above your head,

57:41.208 --> 57:43.165
where... wherever you...
we can see them.

57:43.167 --> 57:45.415
Pan-a-cake, pan-a-cake,

57:45.417 --> 57:48.248
baker's man.

57:48.250 --> 57:53.248
Bake me a cake
as fast as you can.

57:53.250 --> 57:56.915
Pat it, and prick it,

57:56.917 --> 57:59.915
and mark it with a B,

57:59.917 --> 58:01.706
and put it in the oven,

58:01.708 --> 58:03.831
for Satan and me.

58:07.958 --> 58:08.456
Stop.

58:26.792 --> 58:28.083
- I got her.
- I got her, now turn.

58:45.958 --> 58:47.625
Good morning, Stacy.

58:49.958 --> 58:52.040
Why are my arms tied down?

58:53.000 --> 58:54.373
I can't move my arms.

58:54.375 --> 58:56.248
It's just a precautionary.

58:56.250 --> 58:57.831
- It's...
- Let me go! Let me go!

58:57.833 --> 58:58.873
Relax!

58:58.875 --> 58:59.958
Let me... you can't do this.

59:01.458 --> 59:02.375
Relax.

59:17.375 --> 59:19.956
How're you feeling?

59:19.958 --> 59:23.081
Hmm, don't know.

59:23.083 --> 59:24.915
We'd like to get you up
and out for a walk,

59:24.917 --> 59:27.998
get some fresh air,
go see Dr. Malek after.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.165
Okay?

59:29.167 --> 59:31.040
Hmm.

59:31.042 --> 59:32.790
Yeah, okay.

59:32.792 --> 59:33.875
Open up.

59:47.208 --> 59:48.958
Okay, good.

01:00:31.333 --> 01:00:33.415
I've been waiting for you.

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:35.206
I know, lovey.

01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.456
Could've told me
who they were.

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:41.123
Yes, I should have.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.248
Why didn't you?

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.915
- I wanted to protect you.
- Protect me?

01:00:45.917 --> 01:00:48.998
How exactly did you protect me?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.290
I'm back in this dump
taking pills every day.

01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:56.331
I tried to warn you.

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:59.581
They never forgave me.

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:01.540
What do they want?

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:04.915
To join them.

01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:07.915
Oh, I wish you'd
never discovered that game.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.915
But don't blame yourself, honey.

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:21.956
It's my fault.

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.123
No.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:26.123
No, Stacy,
don't think like that.

01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:29.623
It's not your fault I died,
it was my time.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:32.290
Stop blaming yourself.

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:35.248
I can't do this.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:40.123
Then you need to let me go.

01:01:40.125 --> 01:01:43.290
I don't think I'm ready.

01:01:43.292 --> 01:01:45.623
I need you.

01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:48.456
You'll be okay, hmm?

01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:50.290
Be strong.

01:01:50.292 --> 01:01:52.081
I love you.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.958
I love you, too, honey.

01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:06.167
Come in.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.998
Afternoon, Stacy.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.290
Afternoon.

01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:14.456
You're looking better.

01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:16.581
Yeah, feel great.

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:18.956
And you're sleeping?

01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:21.998
Well, I'm not
having the dreams anymore.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.540
I'm sleeping right
through the night.

01:02:23.542 --> 01:02:24.456
Hmm.

01:02:24.458 --> 01:02:26.040
And your vitals are good.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:28.206
Much improved.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:32.081
Tell me
who were you talking to earlier?

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:33.373
What do you mean?

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.915
The nurse?

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.040
No.

01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:39.290
Outside, in the grounds.

01:02:39.292 --> 01:02:40.623
Were you spying on me?

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:45.206
Well, you can't help but notice
when you glance out the window.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:49.623
Well, I was talkin' to myself.

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:51.915
You... you told me
to like speak out loud

01:02:51.917 --> 01:02:54.998
or write down my thoughts,
right?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.956
That it would
help release anxiety.

01:02:57.958 --> 01:02:59.623
And has it?

01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:01.998
Absolutely.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.250
My mind is so much clearer.

01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:07.581
Stacy.

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.540
Stacy.

01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:11.415
- Stacy.
- Yeah?

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:12.458
Are you okay?

01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:18.623
Yeah, of course.

01:03:18.625 --> 01:03:22.123
You seem to be
a little bit upset?

01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:25.208
Would you like
to talk to me about it?

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.458
Play the game.

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.123
- Stacy!
- I'm sorry my head is pounding

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:34.081
and it's really distracting.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:39.998
Um, I don't think
I had enough water today.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.206
Do you mind if I go back
to my room to lie down.

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:46.290
- Of course.
- Thanks.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.623
Hello, Margie?

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.456
Yeah, hi.

01:04:11.458 --> 01:04:14.500
Um, are you able to come
into my office later today?

01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:18.708
3:00 p.m.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.123
Perfect.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.248
I'll see you then.

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:41.831
Ems.

01:04:41.833 --> 01:04:43.000
Hi, Stace.

01:04:45.833 --> 01:04:47.417
Aren't you gonna give me a hug?

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:53.165
Ems, it... it's okay.

01:04:53.167 --> 01:04:55.456
Uh, I'm... I'm fine.

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:58.123
Do you mind if I don't?

01:04:58.125 --> 01:05:00.665
Just...

01:05:00.667 --> 01:05:02.165
- You know.
- I understand.

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:07.498
Um, I'm just glad to see you.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.581
Uh, where...
where are my parents?

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:11.206
Weren't they gonna come
with you?

01:05:11.208 --> 01:05:13.748
Uh, they had to see Dr. Malek.

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.790
But they're coming back here,
right?

01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:17.417
Yeah,
they said they wouldn't be long.

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:24.081
Are you okay?

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:27.290
Yeah, I'm a little sore.

01:05:27.292 --> 01:05:28.373
I bet.

01:05:42.417 --> 01:05:46.415
Stacy, you scared the shit
out of me.

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:47.498
Police, the doctors,
we're all tryin'

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.623
to figure out what happened.

01:05:50.625 --> 01:05:51.750
It wasn't you.

01:05:56.458 --> 01:05:57.750
That face.

01:06:00.792 --> 01:06:04.581
I'll never forget it.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:08.248
I'm sorry.

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:13.165
I... I don't remember anything.

01:06:13.167 --> 01:06:15.083
Still blank.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:22.165
I feel crazy.

01:06:22.167 --> 01:06:23.165
I just...

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:31.500
Hey, it's okay.

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:35.706
You're gonna be okay.

01:06:35.708 --> 01:06:36.790
Yeah.

01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:41.540
I'm just glad you're safe.

01:06:41.542 --> 01:06:44.915
Where's Jess?

01:06:44.917 --> 01:06:47.290
She's with that guy.

01:06:47.292 --> 01:06:50.456
Didn't wanna come.

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:52.581
What guy?

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:54.333
Just someone
she met through friends.

01:06:56.958 --> 01:06:58.375
It's Matt, isn't it?

01:07:02.542 --> 01:07:03.790
Yeah.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:07.625
Yeah.

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.706
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:13.206
How is she?

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:14.873
Is she gonna be okay?

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:18.498
Well, we're gonna run
a few more tests this afternoon,

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.790
but it's likely
that what she has experienced

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:22.623
is a fugue state.

01:07:22.625 --> 01:07:24.665
What does that even mean?

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:27.581
Sometimes, under a lot of stress
and anxiety,

01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:31.581
the human brain loses touch
with reality.

01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:34.623
Stacy seems to be dissociating

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:38.665
from her recent experiences
at home.

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:42.748
What went on that night,
do you have any answers?

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:43.873
What happened to her?

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:45.956
Hey, take it easy, Marge.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:47.581
- Please.
- Sorry.

01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:49.415
I'm not sleeping much.

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:51.956
She's under stress.

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:54.456
How is everything at home?

01:07:54.458 --> 01:07:58.456
I understand that your mother
passed away last year.

01:07:58.458 --> 01:07:59.623
Yeah.

01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:02.873
Um, Stacy took it pretty hard.

01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:08.248
Are you aware
that she still connects to her?

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.873
What do you mean?

01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:13.375
She converses with her.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.706
That's imposs...
why are you telling me this?

01:08:19.707 --> 01:08:20.790
I mean
shouldn't you be explaining

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.040
how she overpowered
the officers?

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:26.040
We're still looking into that.

01:08:26.042 --> 01:08:32.372
Tell me did you have
two young girls in your family,

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:37.747
blonde hair, died young.

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:40.872
Uh, yes, but...

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:42.372
I mean what does this have
to do with...

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:46.872
Stacy has visions
of these girls.

01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:49.956
She said
they've been haunting her.

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:51.747
I mean we've never once spoken
to her about them.

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.582
- How could she even...
- And there's this.

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:59.457
The report states that
it was in one of your books.

01:09:01.917 --> 01:09:07.415
April 18th, 1957.

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:11.081
That was the year.

01:09:12.625 --> 01:09:18.456
When my mother was young,
she played with this game,

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:21.665
which communicated
with the dead.

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:23.540
I think it was linked
to this strange wooden box

01:09:23.542 --> 01:09:24.872
she found in the woods.

01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:25.792
Hmm.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.497
Weeks later, her sisters died
in a mysterious drowning.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.372
It was in 1957.

01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:39.667
My mother's never once spoken
about it since.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.540
When I was a little girl,

01:09:45.542 --> 01:09:49.122
I was playin'
in my grandpa's shed,

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.581
and I found
some more newspaper articles

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:56.456
in the same wooden box.

01:09:56.458 --> 01:10:00.706
That's when I knew.

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:05.415
Remember it had
these strange markings on it,

01:10:05.417 --> 01:10:06.831
but when I...
I showed it to my mother,

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:10.665
and she panicked,
and buried it in the garden,

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:15.540
and well, it stayed there.

01:10:15.542 --> 01:10:16.831
Many years,
I'd forgotten all about it

01:10:16.833 --> 01:10:18.917
until Stacy discovered it.

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:25.000
Shortly after that
my mother died.

01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.998
We don't know
if they're connected.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.665
We can't make assumptions.

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:33.040
Well, how else, Bob?

01:10:33.042 --> 01:10:37.873
I mean it's a lot of
bad energies surrounding her.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:38.748
Where did she find...

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:42.123
I... I...
I hid it under the stairs,

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.706
locked away with
some old documents, uh...

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.040
Uh...

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:48.706
Our younger daughter Paula
is staying with a friend.

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:50.998
Is she in any danger
being around Stacy?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.998
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.831
What?

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.956
I want to protect both my kids,
Robert!

01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:57.456
I get that.

01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:58.790
Don't worry.

01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:01.623
Stacy's stable now,
but we won't release her

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:03.706
unless we're absolutely certain
that she's well enough

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:05.040
to go home.

01:11:05.042 --> 01:11:07.706
Well, when would that be, doc?

01:11:07.708 --> 01:11:09.540
Thank you.

01:11:09.542 --> 01:11:11.165
Thank you both for your time.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:13.915
But I...
I have more questions for you.

01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.956
I... I do, too.

01:11:15.958 --> 01:11:17.581
We'll get to those later.

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:20.540
It will help
if Stacy saw you guys now.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.123
Let's go see her, Marge.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.498
Okay, let's go.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.415
Come on.

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:26.915
Can you tell us where she is,
please?

01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:28.498
Down the hall,
talk to the nurse.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.540
- Great.
- They'll direct you.

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:30.542
Thank you.

01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:34.081
I'll wait outside.

01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:34.917
See ya.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:56.706
- Stacy.
- Mama.

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:58.748
Oh, thank God.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.915
Hi.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.748
Hey, sport?

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:04.123
How you feeling?

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:07.748
Okay, I guess.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:09.831
Uh, we've talked with Dr. Malek

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.790
and he feels
you need a few more days here,

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.123
then you can come home.

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.706
Sorry, I um...

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:18.206
I... I thought I was
coming home today.

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:20.123
It's okay, sport.

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:22.540
It's just a few more days, yeah.

01:12:22.542 --> 01:12:25.248
They need to run
some more tests.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.081
Tests?

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:28.831
I'm not
their fuckin' guinea pig!

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:30.123
Stacy!

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:31.831
They were holding you down!

01:12:31.833 --> 01:12:35.623
The doctors have no idea
what the hell happened.

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:37.790
This is ridiculous.

01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:40.623
No, actually um,
this is a mistake.

01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:44.123
Like they can't...
they can't just keep me here.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:47.040
I'm better.

01:12:47.042 --> 01:12:48.208
Dad.

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:53.831
Maybe we should
talk to him again.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:55.206
- Yeah.
- You know, what he said.

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:57.831
What did he say?

01:12:57.833 --> 01:13:01.040
Well, I... I have the right
to know, don't I?

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:02.958
You just tell me.

01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:11.873
We're all concerned about you.

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:13.248
The police have been pushing
for answers,

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.206
and I don't know what to say,
and I...

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.917
We've been doing everything
we can to protect you.

01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:24.748
Dr. Malek mentioned
that you've been having visions

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:30.790
of my aunties,
Moira and Abigail.

01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:34.331
What exactly were you girls
doing that night?

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:37.790
I don't know.

01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:42.123
We were playing around
with some app,

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:48.208
like a... a virtual spirit app.

01:13:52.958 --> 01:13:56.123
Dr. Malek has seen you talking
to yourself.

01:13:56.125 --> 01:13:58.706
That's bullshit.

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:00.667
I wanna go home now!

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.831
- I'm sorry, love.
- Calm down.

01:14:03.833 --> 01:14:04.956
This is for the best.

01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:09.167
You call yourself my parents?

01:14:11.208 --> 01:14:14.248
Keeping me locked up
in this place.

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:16.956
Calm down, Stace.

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:17.875
Excuse me.

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:21.248
Calm down, calm down.

01:14:27.958 --> 01:14:28.998
- Calm down, alright.
- No. No!

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.040
Don't do this!

01:14:31.042 --> 01:14:33.290
Breathe, breathe.

01:14:41.917 --> 01:14:44.248
I need you both to go outside.

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:45.956
- Jesus.
- Please.

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:22.331
Play the game, Stacy.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:23.790
Play with us.

01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:40.123
Ready.

01:15:40.125 --> 01:15:43.417
Both of you...

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:45.998
H... how did you die?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.790
They took us.

01:15:47.792 --> 01:15:48.831
What do you mean?

01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:52.123
You will see, soon.

01:16:13.875 --> 01:16:14.915
Stop!

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.123
You won't feel pain anymore.

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:28.081
Be free.

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:30.250
Don't fight it.

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:33.373
Make them pay.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.042
And then you can take me.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.290
Leave it.

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:08.081
Just wait.

01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:09.456
- Leave it.
- Just wait a second, alright?

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.956
- Fuck.
- What?

01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:12.456
What is it?

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:13.831
What the fuck?

01:17:13.833 --> 01:17:15.290
I mean I don't know
what the fuck it is,

01:17:15.292 --> 01:17:17.123
I just got it through a text,
but like...

01:17:17.125 --> 01:17:20.373
Oh.

01:17:20.375 --> 01:17:21.750
What is this?

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:25.456
Okay, I know
who's fuckin' doin' this shit.

01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:27.248
- Fuckin' Stacy.
- Delete it now!

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.415
Alright, fuck, just calm down,
alright?

01:17:28.417 --> 01:17:31.248
Fuck, just wait.

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.373
That's the same app Stacy used,
okay?

01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:36.081
Look what happened to her.

01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:38.123
What the fuck?

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:39.375
Come on.

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:51.623
Hey, Stacy.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.290
What's goin' on?

01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:55.542
Hey, Stace.

01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:01.250
Are you okay?

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:06.875
You're supposed to be
in the hospital.

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:13.875
Okay.

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.125
Let's go.

01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:23.581
Okay, look, Stace,
you got it all wrong, okay?

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:25.290
Look, you got it all wrong,
alright?

01:18:25.292 --> 01:18:26.456
I am just...

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:32.331
X marks the spot
upon the ground.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:38.498
Lie there still,
not a sound.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.540
Soon you'll be dead.

01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:42.665
S... no, no, no, no, Stacy,
listen to me, alright?

01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:44.290
I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:46.665
Look, I... I didn't mean to...

01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:47.581
You just listen to me, okay?

01:18:47.583 --> 01:18:48.917
I, uh...

01:19:53.667 --> 01:19:55.083
I'm free.

01:20:22.292 --> 01:20:23.417
Hello.

01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:29.125
Yeah, this is she.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.290
What's up?

01:20:44.292 --> 01:20:45.208
Honey, honey?

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.167
What's the matter?

01:20:53.625 --> 01:20:55.623
Hello?

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:56.542
Yes.

01:20:59.417 --> 01:21:01.456
Okay, we'll be right there.

01:21:35.583 --> 01:21:37.250
Do you wanna go upstairs?

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:39.250
Okay.

01:21:53.417 --> 01:21:54.375
Strange.

01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:57.750
Being in here without Stace.

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:04.125
How are you doing?

01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:06.623
Okay.

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:07.542
I miss her.

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:10.042
I know.

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:11.792
We all do.

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:17.292
She was my best friend.

01:22:18.792 --> 01:22:20.581
How'd she die?

01:22:20.583 --> 01:22:22.208
Mom and dad won't tell me.

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:26.333
I think she died
after your Grandma Betty died.

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.333
She was never the same girl.

01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:31.750
Why didn't the doctor save her?

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:34.750
I'm sure they tried to.

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:41.708
When she went bad, she was
talking about a phone app.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.623
What did she mean?

01:22:45.625 --> 01:22:48.665
Paula, promise me
you will never download an app

01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:50.208
that your parents
don't know about.

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:52.873
I'm dead serious.

01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:55.248
Yeah, there are some bad ones,
it's very dangerous.

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:56.625
Is that what Stacy did?

01:22:58.208 --> 01:22:59.125
Yeah.

01:23:01.167 --> 01:23:02.625
I shouldn't be telling you this.

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:08.625
This room gives me the creeps.

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:11.792
I'm gonna go.

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:16.331
Do you wanna come?

01:23:16.333 --> 01:23:18.581
I think I'll stay here a while.

01:23:18.583 --> 01:23:19.500
Okay.

01:23:20.583 --> 01:23:22.333
Just call me if you need me.

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:06.623
Stacy.
