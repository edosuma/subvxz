10:49.631 --> 10:50.731
to find Deja all by herself.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.232
<i>She been by herself</i>
<i>all night.</i>

10:52.234 --> 10:53.233
I don't have a clue
where Tracy is.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.601
My God, is Deja okay?

10:54.603 --> 10:56.136
Looks to be,

10:56.138 --> 10:57.537
a little disheveled is all.

10:57.539 --> 10:59.506
And I wanna get her to school
so she can have a normal day,

10:59.508 --> 11:00.508
but my car won't start.

11:00.509 --> 11:01.508
So if I could please
use your card,

11:01.510 --> 11:02.509
I'd greatly appreciate it.

11:02.511 --> 11:03.677
Yeah, I will
text you the number.

11:03.679 --> 11:05.245
Have you made contact with
Tracy's parents?

11:05.247 --> 11:07.013
No, they haven't
heard anything.

11:07.015 --> 11:08.248
You don't think--

11:08.250 --> 11:09.649
What else is there to think?

11:09.651 --> 11:11.084
Oh, God.

11:11.086 --> 11:13.086
You got the number
of that P.I.

11:13.088 --> 11:14.121
you used to
find me a while back.

11:14.123 --> 11:15.222
<i>Yeah, Patrick,</i>

11:15.224 --> 11:16.923
he's expensive
and those costs add up.

11:16.925 --> 11:18.259
<i>So I don't think</i>
<i>that's for you.</i>

11:18.260 --> 11:20.327
Yeah, text me
his number anyway.

11:20.329 --> 11:22.095
Yeah, sure, no problem.

11:22.097 --> 11:24.097
I don't know, Letta.

11:24.099 --> 11:26.800
What if she been in an accident
or she was assaulted.

11:26.802 --> 11:29.469
Maybe-- Yeah, maybe, maybe.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.172
This is not what
I needed today.

11:32.174 --> 11:33.840
Poor Deja.

11:33.842 --> 11:35.075
Yeah.

11:35.077 --> 11:36.510
<i>Good luck, Patrick.</i>

11:36.512 --> 11:38.044
Well, thanks, uh.

11:38.046 --> 11:39.679
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know, okay?

11:39.681 --> 11:41.114
<i>All right, bye.</i>

11:45.319 --> 11:46.787
Miss Keller's gonna be mad.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.822
Oh, she'll understand,
everybody's late sometimes.

11:48.824 --> 11:50.524
Now I'll pick you up
at 3:00, okay?

11:50.526 --> 11:51.558
You promise?

11:51.560 --> 11:54.227
Of course, I promise.

11:54.229 --> 11:55.629
What about the bake sale?

11:55.631 --> 11:57.063
What bake sale?

11:57.065 --> 11:58.698
Mommy gives me money
to buy cupcakes

11:58.700 --> 11:59.800
in the bake sale on Monday.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.802
How much?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.068
$3.00.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.073
Oh...

12:08.543 --> 12:10.811
One, two.

12:12.647 --> 12:13.914
Thanks, Dad.

12:13.916 --> 12:16.750
All right, see you, darling.

12:25.026 --> 12:27.527
The president is schedule to
give a major speech tomorrow

12:27.529 --> 12:30.230
at the National Defense
University in Washington.

12:30.232 --> 12:33.767
The main topic, our country's
use or as some would charge

12:33.769 --> 12:36.336
our misuse
of unmanned aerial vehicles,

12:36.338 --> 12:37.637
<i>the drone program.</i>

12:37.639 --> 12:39.706
<i>Perhaps no other aspect</i>
<i>of modern warfare</i>

12:39.708 --> 12:42.108
<i>has been more controversial.</i>

12:42.110 --> 12:43.343
I'll be right back.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.830
<i>How no country at war</i>
<i>in human history</i>

12:46.832 --> 12:49.032
<i>has been more attentive</i>
<i>to preventing...</i>

12:49.034 --> 12:52.636
Excuse me, I am working
60 plus hours a week

12:52.638 --> 12:54.971
to make sure the boys
have everything they need.

12:54.973 --> 12:56.006
What more do you want from me?

12:56.008 --> 12:57.407
<i>More money.</i>

12:57.409 --> 12:59.910
I have full custody
of them now, Kara.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.244
It isn't about spite,
it's mathematics.

13:01.246 --> 13:02.646
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

13:02.648 --> 13:04.481
One minute you're complaining
that I'm working too much

13:04.483 --> 13:06.883
and now you're telling me that
I-- That you need more money?

13:06.885 --> 13:08.518
<i>Which one is it, John?</i>

13:08.520 --> 13:09.819
It's both, obviously.

13:09.821 --> 13:12.622
And however you wanna solve
this puzzle is not my problem.

13:12.624 --> 13:14.324
The problem is
tuition went up 12%,

13:14.326 --> 13:16.393
and I don't have it.
<i>Oh, well, you know what?</i>

13:16.395 --> 13:18.895
Maybe it's time to get
to know the real world.

13:18.897 --> 13:20.564
<i>Maybe they need to go</i>
<i>to public school.</i>

13:20.566 --> 13:22.532
No, not in Atlanta. Why?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.167
<i>Public school was</i>
<i>just fine for us,</i>

13:24.169 --> 13:25.569
and it'll be
just fine for them.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.337
Oh, yeah, 'cause that--
that makes good sense, Kara.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.472
Well, oh, what makes
more sense, John, huh?

13:29.474 --> 13:30.774
<i>Me working more hours?</i>

13:30.776 --> 13:32.276
<i>Is that what makes</i>
<i>more sense to you?</i>

13:32.277 --> 13:34.144
<i>One government estimate placed</i>

13:34.146 --> 13:37.214
<i>at least 388 drone strikes</i>
<i>landing in Pakistan and Yemen.</i>

13:39.518 --> 13:41.251
What?

13:50.228 --> 13:51.228
Turn on CBS.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.862
Wait-- what?

13:54.632 --> 13:56.967
<i> It is unthinkable.</i>

13:56.969 --> 13:58.201
<i>A middle school shooting</i>

13:58.203 --> 14:01.104
<i>45 miles southwest</i>
<i>Richmond, Virginia.</i>

14:01.106 --> 14:02.706
<i>We know at least</i>
<i>seven victims...</i>

14:04.009 --> 14:05.041
Yeah?

14:05.043 --> 14:06.043
Kara, have you heard?

14:06.044 --> 14:07.544
Yeah, Martin's gonna break it.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.713
Then we're gonna cross to you
for coverage, okay, so suit up.

14:09.715 --> 14:10.715
Okay.

14:13.551 --> 14:15.352
, breaking news. Then we're gonna cross
to you for coverage, okay, so suit up.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.187
School shooting in Virginia.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.488
So watch your prompter
for the wrap-up tag, okay?

14:18.490 --> 14:19.824
<i>Copy.</i>

14:24.328 --> 14:26.529
Going to live coverage
in ten seconds.

14:26.531 --> 14:27.530
Thank you, Jeffrey,
will have full coverage

14:27.532 --> 14:28.665
of the President's speech

14:28.667 --> 14:30.400
<i>at the National</i>
<i>Defense University.</i>

14:30.402 --> 14:31.568
Here we go.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.536
On tomorrow's edition
of "The Bradley Report."

14:33.538 --> 14:36.172
<i>Three, two, one.</i>
This just breaking.

14:36.174 --> 14:37.607
There's been a shooting in
a public middle school

14:37.609 --> 14:39.042
in Richmond, Virginia.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.911
The shooter, a recently fired
employee of the school district

14:41.913 --> 14:45.615
<i>has been shot by police</i>
<i>and is presumed dead.</i>

14:45.617 --> 14:47.584
<i>However, there are...</i>
Oh, my God.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.152
This is horrible. I know.

14:49.154 --> 14:50.720
I know, it's so tragic.

14:50.722 --> 14:52.756
I'll never understand this.
Me either.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.924
Listen, we've locked
in reporters and cameras

14:54.926 --> 14:55.959
from the local affiliate.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.560
We've got
two interviews set up.

14:57.562 --> 15:00.196
The first one is with the local
chief of police, Joshua Bisker.

15:00.198 --> 15:02.432
The other one is the parent
of the one of the students.

15:02.434 --> 15:04.367
Her name is Deborah Talbert,
and she goes by Debbie.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.502
We're gonna lead in with her.

15:05.504 --> 15:06.503
Okay, do you have
the school shootings

15:06.505 --> 15:07.537
in America package?

15:07.539 --> 15:08.738
Yes, we'll run it
if we need it.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.873
Okay, perfect.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.308
We have six minutes. Okay.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.575
All right,
six minutes, people.

15:12.577 --> 15:13.777
Okay, we're good?

15:13.779 --> 15:15.529
We are good. Wonderful.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.180
<i>Attention all units.</i>

15:34.182 --> 15:37.517
<i>A suspicious vehicle</i>
<i>reported by unit 6810</i>

15:37.519 --> 15:39.019
<i>at Peyton Forest Elementary.</i>

15:39.021 --> 15:41.654
<i>Please requesting backup.</i>

15:48.963 --> 15:50.363
Something wrong, officer?

15:50.365 --> 15:51.531
Are you lost, sir?

15:51.533 --> 15:56.036
No, my daughter's
in school right there.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.172
License and registration,
please.

15:59.174 --> 16:00.174
For what?

16:02.877 --> 16:04.577
Why are you
getting irritated?

16:04.579 --> 16:06.346
Well, you tell me,
Officer Bilson?

16:09.350 --> 16:11.785
Are you aware there's been
a school shooting?

16:11.787 --> 16:13.686
What? Where?
You're not aware.

16:13.688 --> 16:15.955
No, what-- It's 1:30
and she gets out of school--

16:15.957 --> 16:16.957
Your daughter.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.391
Yes, she gets out
of school at 3:00,

16:18.393 --> 16:20.126
and I thought I could read.

16:20.128 --> 16:21.494
And you thought
the best place to do that

16:21.496 --> 16:23.663
was sitting right in front
of the school?

16:26.034 --> 16:28.435
Yes, officer.

16:28.437 --> 16:31.704
License, registration,
and proof of insurance.

16:33.674 --> 16:37.877
Yeah, blue El Camino.

16:41.616 --> 16:44.484
I'm just sitting here waiting on
my child to get out of school.

16:44.486 --> 16:45.985
Why you sweating me, huh?

16:45.987 --> 16:47.153
Don't you have
something better to do?

16:47.155 --> 16:48.621
Say something else.

17:02.036 --> 17:03.370
Yeah, can I get a check?

17:15.182 --> 17:17.634
<i>All clear.</i>

17:17.636 --> 17:19.569
Yup, copy that.

17:23.641 --> 17:25.340
I'm giving you
a break this time.

17:25.343 --> 17:28.310
Given the sensitivity of today.

17:28.313 --> 17:29.813
Free to go.

17:47.231 --> 17:48.498
Can you hear me okay, Debbie?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.333
<i>Yes, fine,</i>

17:50.335 --> 17:51.701
<i>it's weird not being able</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

17:51.703 --> 17:52.936
<i>It's like you're on the radio.</i>

17:52.938 --> 17:54.704
I do appreciate you taking
the time to speak with us.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.040
<i>You're welcome.</i>

17:56.041 --> 17:59.075
And I promise to be sensitive
to you and the other families.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.211
<i>Okay, but I only wanna talk</i>
<i>about school procedure.</i>

18:01.213 --> 18:03.179
<i>I wanna be respectful</i>
<i>to the other parents.</i>

18:03.181 --> 18:04.214
Oh, yeah, of course.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.882
Absolutely.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.918
So I understand that you know
that your daughter's okay?

18:08.920 --> 18:10.420
<i>Yes, thank God,</i>

18:10.422 --> 18:12.288
<i>I got a text from her</i>
<i>saying she was held up</i>

18:12.290 --> 18:13.289
<i>in the library</i>
<i>with her friends</i>

18:13.291 --> 18:14.290
<i>when the shooting happened.</i>

18:14.292 --> 18:16.125
When did you receive
her last text?

18:16.127 --> 18:18.394
<i>It was, um,</i>
<i>about two hours ago?</i>

18:18.396 --> 18:20.296
And she's a seventh grader?
<i>Yes.</i>

18:20.298 --> 18:21.531
M.J., the kids
are coming out soon.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.033
I'm gonna hold on Debbie
in case she stays around.

18:24.035 --> 18:26.302
And I've got new copy headed
to you in like 20 seconds.

18:26.304 --> 18:27.403
We'll be right back with you

18:27.405 --> 18:28.905
in just a second,
okay, Debbie?

18:28.907 --> 18:32.108
And thank you
for your insight.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.610
In three.

18:35.112 --> 18:37.914
A day of carnage and hope
in Richmond, Virginia.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.082
If you're just joining us,

18:39.084 --> 18:41.117
a gunman barged past
security protocols

18:41.119 --> 18:42.485
at James Madison Middle School

18:42.487 --> 18:45.154
in Easton, Virginia
just outside of Richmond.

18:45.156 --> 18:48.057
We can confirm that the shooter
has been killed by police

18:48.059 --> 18:50.360
with a confirmed
seven additional fatalities

18:50.362 --> 18:51.394
in the school.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.429
Debbie, this is Kara Lynch.

18:53.431 --> 18:54.964
I'm one of the SNC producers.

18:54.966 --> 18:56.900
Oh, are we
still gonna do this?

18:56.902 --> 18:58.034
They're asking
the parents to line up.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.502
<i>The kids are coming out soon.</i>

18:59.504 --> 19:02.105
Well, that's absolutely
most important.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.007
Um, if you'd like
to talk to us

19:04.009 --> 19:05.508
after your reunion,
we'd love that.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.543
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

19:06.545 --> 19:07.577
That's okay.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.113
I understand,
um, I've got two boys.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.882
<i>All the best to you, Debbie,</i>
<i>and if you change your mind,</i>

19:12.884 --> 19:14.517
just let
my field producer know, okay?

19:14.519 --> 19:16.286
<i>Okay, all right, thank you.</i>

19:16.288 --> 19:18.154
M.J., kids are coming out soon.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.657
Police are now engaging in
a thorough...

19:20.659 --> 19:23.026
Would you stay with Debbie
in case she talks to us later

19:23.028 --> 19:24.460
after they get the kids out.

19:24.462 --> 19:25.762
<i>SNC has learned that once</i>

19:25.764 --> 19:27.096
the students are clear to leave,

19:27.098 --> 19:28.865
they will line up
the students by grade

19:28.867 --> 19:30.934
letting the lower grades
out first.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.136
This middle school
starts at the sixth grade

19:33.138 --> 19:34.704
and goes through the eighth.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.540
<i>In response to the Sandy Hook</i>
<i>Elementary School shooting,</i>

19:37.542 --> 19:40.376
<i>some schools across the nation</i>
<i>have beefed up security,</i>

19:40.378 --> 19:42.178
<i>adding security gates,</i>
<i>and like this school...</i>

19:42.180 --> 19:43.513
Look at this. What?

19:43.515 --> 19:46.916
Two official types
she talking to.

19:46.918 --> 19:48.351
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.720
No, no, no!
She's coming out!

19:50.722 --> 19:53.856
<i>She's coming out, no, no!</i>

19:53.858 --> 19:58.328
<i>No, she can't be dead, no, no!</i>

19:58.330 --> 19:59.696
Where is my daughter?!

19:59.698 --> 20:00.964
<i>When he was confronted</i>

20:00.966 --> 20:03.633
<i>by a vice principal</i>
<i>the shooting began.</i>

20:03.635 --> 20:05.001
<i>She's gonna be coming out!</i>

20:05.003 --> 20:06.836
Another ten minutes before--

20:06.838 --> 20:08.338
Before the kids
will be released.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.907
M.J., go to commercial,

20:10.909 --> 20:12.842
the kids are not
coming out yet.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.677
<i>Hopefully,</i>
<i>the release of the children</i>

20:14.679 --> 20:16.512
when we come back.

20:16.514 --> 20:17.614
<i> We're out.</i>

20:17.616 --> 20:18.615
Hey, Kara,
why didn't we go to Debbie?

20:18.617 --> 20:19.816
<i>I thought she was great.</i>

20:19.818 --> 20:20.883
Would you step off the set?

20:20.885 --> 20:22.885
I have to
tell you something, okay?

20:23.954 --> 20:27.724
<i>No, she can't be dead, no!</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:30.426
<i>No, where is my daughter?!</i>

20:30.428 --> 20:33.696
<i>Where is she?!</i>
<i>Where is she?!</i>

20:33.698 --> 20:35.398
<i>She's gonna be coming out!</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:39.669
<i>No, no, no!</i>

20:39.671 --> 20:40.937
<i>No!</i>

20:53.618 --> 20:55.218
Hey, sis. <i> Hey, Patrick.</i>

20:55.220 --> 20:56.386
How's Deja doing?

20:56.388 --> 20:57.687
<i>Are there any updates?</i>

20:57.689 --> 20:59.155
Uh.

21:01.992 --> 21:03.393
Well, no one's heard
from her.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.094
<i>From what I gather,</i>

21:05.096 --> 21:07.597
Deja spent the night
alone a few times.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.799
Only difference is
Tracy usually makes it back.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.168
<i>But she's okay.</i>

21:12.170 --> 21:14.470
She's tough,
she's a Patterson.

21:14.472 --> 21:15.538
No, she's a child.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.407
Look, I'm just looking
for the light, okay?

21:17.409 --> 21:19.976
I'm sorry,
is there anything I can do?

21:19.978 --> 21:21.344
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

21:21.346 --> 21:23.246
Just talking it out helps.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.648
<i>And I don't need</i>
<i>the stress right now.</i>

21:25.650 --> 21:28.618
Who's gonna try to get her
fed and off to bed?

21:28.620 --> 21:30.486
Hopefully,
I'll hear from Tracy tomorrow.

21:30.488 --> 21:31.654
I don't know how a mother

21:31.656 --> 21:33.573
could just abandon
her daughter like that.

21:33.575 --> 21:35.441
Yeah.

21:35.443 --> 21:36.609
Done.

21:36.611 --> 21:39.946
Well.
Whoa, that's good, baby.

21:41.282 --> 21:42.281
Look, I gotta
check some homework,

21:42.283 --> 21:43.449
I'll call you tomorrow.

21:43.451 --> 21:45.826
<i>Okay.</i>
Mm-hmm, okay, what we got?

22:04.104 --> 22:05.204
Hello, Sheldon?

22:05.206 --> 22:06.572
Yeah, right over there.

22:06.574 --> 22:07.940
Hey, did I get you
at a bad time?

22:07.942 --> 22:10.143
No, just wrapping up work.

22:10.145 --> 22:11.544
<i>Well, I hope</i>
<i>you get done soon</i>

22:11.546 --> 22:14.680
<i>because I'm having a little</i>
<i>party for a friend of mine.</i>

22:14.682 --> 22:17.350
Very impromptu,
nothing-- nothing fancy.

22:17.352 --> 22:19.552
Just some drinks
and conversation.

22:19.554 --> 22:20.554
Really?

22:20.555 --> 22:22.755
Yeah, really.

22:22.757 --> 22:24.524
<i>Is that cool, any issues?</i>

22:24.526 --> 22:25.558
No, you know, I'd--

22:25.560 --> 22:26.793
Yeah, yeah, you know what?

22:26.795 --> 22:27.994
Yeah, there is an issue.

22:27.996 --> 22:29.429
<i>We made plans for dinner</i>
<i>last night,</i>

22:29.431 --> 22:30.997
and then I don't
hear from you all day..

22:30.999 --> 22:32.365
Well, to be fair--

22:32.367 --> 22:34.434
And here you come at
the 11th hour with some invite

22:34.436 --> 22:37.061
<i>to a party, yeah,</i>
<i>that's an issue.</i>

22:40.040 --> 22:42.141
Okay, you're--
you're right, I apologize.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.076
<i>That's the downside</i>
<i>of having</i>

22:44.078 --> 22:46.579
an amazing assistant
for most of my adult life.

22:47.781 --> 22:49.482
You know, I'm--

22:49.484 --> 22:52.852
I'm sorry, you-- you really
didn't deserve all of that,

22:52.854 --> 22:55.455
I'm-- Just that--

22:55.457 --> 22:57.123
<i>Last minute plans,</i>

22:57.125 --> 22:58.858
<i>the re-scheduling,</i>
<i>not being available.</i>

22:58.860 --> 23:02.094
It's all red flags
from past relationships.

23:02.096 --> 23:04.764
But that has nothing to do
with you, and I apologize.

23:06.733 --> 23:09.001
Look, tonight is real.

23:09.003 --> 23:11.170
<i>I would love for you</i>
<i>to come meet my friends.</i>

23:11.172 --> 23:13.072
<i>They've heard all about you.</i>

23:13.074 --> 23:15.541
<i>But if you don't feel like</i>
<i>going out, I get it, 100%.</i>

23:15.543 --> 23:17.376
You've had a long day.

23:17.378 --> 23:20.546

to see you that I completely

but it definitely reminded me
why I left New York

26:09.367 --> 26:10.766
in the late '80s.

26:10.768 --> 26:14.036
I mean, it was so depressing,
all that graffiti on every wall.

26:14.038 --> 26:16.605
Porno theaters all over
42nd Street.

26:16.607 --> 26:18.207
Shooting galleries
on the Lower East Side,

26:18.209 --> 26:19.475
I was there too.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.277
But Piñero couldn't
escape like we did.

26:21.279 --> 26:24.080
His palms were the diary
of his life.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.015
Yeah.

26:26.017 --> 26:29.452
Does the work
affect you at all?

26:29.454 --> 26:30.720
I don't know.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.355
Honestly, I thought
we were gonna see

26:32.357 --> 26:34.290
the Piñero with
Benjamin Bratt in it.

26:34.292 --> 26:38.294
I did. He's hot, come on.

26:38.296 --> 26:41.497
You're always trying
to make light of things.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.833
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

26:43.835 --> 26:45.735
I am tell--
What, you don't think

26:45.737 --> 26:47.269
I'm telling you how
I really feel?

26:47.271 --> 26:49.739
No, I don't.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.976
You use irony and humor
as a defensive shield.

26:53.978 --> 26:55.111
You know, I--

26:55.113 --> 26:57.913
Doesn't that just
become exhausting?

26:57.915 --> 27:00.282
Yeah.

27:00.284 --> 27:04.553
But my wit
has become my blankie.

27:04.555 --> 27:06.789
Come on.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.224
All right, I did--

27:08.226 --> 27:10.493
I enjoyed seeing him
read his own poem.

27:10.495 --> 27:11.727
"Seeking a cause."

27:11.729 --> 27:14.864
Yes, that last line really
got me, what was it, um--

27:14.866 --> 27:17.833
"He died
never finding the cause

27:17.835 --> 27:20.836
because he never knew
he was the cause?"

27:21.873 --> 27:22.905
That was powerful.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.373
It was.

27:24.375 --> 27:25.508
I thought that was powerful.

27:25.510 --> 27:30.246
I feel like Mary Jane
knows her cause, you know?

27:30.248 --> 27:33.015
<i>You</i> know your cause.

27:33.017 --> 27:38.821
John has my kids and I don't
know what my cause is.

27:38.823 --> 27:44.427
I don't know
what my reason for being is.

27:44.429 --> 27:47.196
All I do is work.

27:47.198 --> 27:49.265
I'm like a robot,
I go to work.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.267
And after what happened today,

27:51.269 --> 27:54.437
I've just been like
questioning everything.

27:54.439 --> 27:55.439
I feel...

27:56.773 --> 27:58.474
It's--

27:58.476 --> 28:00.976
I think maybe I just need
to find my cause, right?

28:00.978 --> 28:03.412
I think that's what it's about.

28:03.414 --> 28:07.550
Maybe you're your own cause.

28:09.219 --> 28:10.419
Maybe.

28:10.421 --> 28:15.257
You'll find out why you feel
you're so unlovable.

28:16.526 --> 28:18.294
Get out of my head.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.795
Maybe--

28:22.632 --> 28:24.033
I'm your cause.

28:24.035 --> 28:28.471
You are a hot mess cause.

28:33.243 --> 28:36.579
There are things
that never change

28:36.581 --> 28:41.150
and we are not one of them,
I fear.

28:41.152 --> 28:45.955
The trouble with
our love is here.

28:45.957 --> 28:48.591
The trouble with
our love is round

28:48.593 --> 28:52.261
when you cannot look me
in the eye and lie.

28:52.263 --> 28:55.164
When you run
so far away you forget

28:55.166 --> 28:57.266
where to get back to.

29:00.604 --> 29:05.441
Now... you are

29:05.443 --> 29:07.776
what you never wanted to be.

29:11.882 --> 29:14.917
Go ahead.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.352
Bite me.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.363
<i>Hello?</i> Hey, Mark.

30:01.365 --> 30:03.165
I can't be here by myself.

30:03.167 --> 30:04.867
You wanna come to
this party with me?

30:04.869 --> 30:08.070
Hell, yeah, you know what?

30:08.072 --> 30:10.606
I do not wanna be here
alone tonight, either?

30:10.608 --> 30:13.976
Let's go get stupid ass...

30:13.978 --> 30:15.878
<i>...drunk.</i>

30:15.880 --> 30:17.046
All right, I'll call you
when I'm ready.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.048
Okay. <i> Bye.</i>

30:30.327 --> 30:31.527
Yeah.

30:31.529 --> 30:34.430
This is how you throw
a dinner party, okay?

30:34.432 --> 30:35.464
I need a raise.

30:35.466 --> 30:38.634
We live in Section 8 housing,
Mary Jane?

30:38.636 --> 30:40.135
I like how
you keep surprising me.

30:40.137 --> 30:42.004
Oh, what woman
could deny you, Sheldon?

30:42.006 --> 30:43.105
This is--

30:43.107 --> 30:45.374
Mark Bradley,
pleasure to meet you.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.742
Same, I heard
a lot about you.

30:46.744 --> 30:48.077
Really? Yes.

30:48.079 --> 30:52.615
Come, I want you to meet
some amazing friends of mine.

31:29.252 --> 31:31.220
Hey, guys.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.856
Ladies, gather 'round.

31:33.858 --> 31:36.725
I just wanna thank you all
for coming.

31:36.727 --> 31:39.395
Most of you know who I am,
the lucky ones don't.

31:40.798 --> 31:42.998
Uh, I don't even know
how I got into this.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.133
The last thing I remember,

31:44.135 --> 31:45.734
I was asking Chuck
what he and Shelly

31:45.736 --> 31:49.538
were going to do for their
anniversary of 25 years!

31:52.792 --> 31:54.626
And he said Shelly
just wants to go out to dinner.

31:54.628 --> 31:57.496
I said, "No! You gotta
celebrate, come on."

31:57.498 --> 32:00.566
And the next thing I know,
I'm staring at you people.

32:00.568 --> 32:03.202
Chuck, Shelly, never known
two greater friends,

32:03.204 --> 32:04.570
I love you.

32:04.572 --> 32:05.671
Chuck, you owe me for life

32:05.673 --> 32:06.672
because I told you
she was the one.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.707
To Chuck and Shelly.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.459
Chuck and Shelly!

32:16.249 --> 32:19.618
Oh, look at that, whoa.

32:21.188 --> 32:22.588
It looks great.

32:25.325 --> 32:26.825
Daddy, is this legal?

32:26.827 --> 32:27.860
Legal?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.328
What do you mean, legal?

32:29.330 --> 32:30.596
It's not my birthday.

32:30.598 --> 32:31.897
So what.

32:31.899 --> 32:34.133
The day of your birth was
the best day of my life.

32:34.135 --> 32:36.468
We can celebrate it
any day we want.

32:36.470 --> 32:38.537
Even on your birthday?

32:38.539 --> 32:40.305
Even on my birthday.

32:40.307 --> 32:42.808
Happy birthday, Daddy.

32:42.810 --> 32:45.110
Mmm, happy birthday, baby.

32:56.523 --> 32:57.689
Was that Mommy?

32:57.691 --> 32:59.491
No.

32:59.493 --> 33:04.263
But we're gonna have some fun
together until she comes home.

33:04.265 --> 33:06.331
And when is she coming home?

33:06.333 --> 33:09.835
I don't know.

33:09.837 --> 33:11.070
But I'm gonna
be there for you

33:11.072 --> 33:12.838
and with you every day,
all right?

33:12.840 --> 33:13.972
All right.
You'll never be alone again,

33:13.974 --> 33:15.707
I promise.

33:15.709 --> 33:17.843
Give me some sugar.
I love you, Daddy.

33:17.845 --> 33:19.078
Mmm, I love you too, baby.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.746
Oh, you got me.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.449
Hey, no.

33:23.451 --> 33:25.017
Want some cake?

33:25.019 --> 33:27.052
Yeah. All right.

33:27.054 --> 33:28.687
Thank you.

33:30.557 --> 33:31.924
Oh, well,

33:31.926 --> 33:35.127
here's to being abandoned
at someone else's party.

33:35.129 --> 33:36.195
When you're in town,

33:36.197 --> 33:37.696
you should ride
the Ferris wheel.

33:37.698 --> 33:39.531
Great city views.

33:39.533 --> 33:41.633
I'll leave the tourist stuff
to the tourists.

33:41.635 --> 33:43.469
I'm only in town
for two more days.

33:43.471 --> 33:44.970
Where's a decent bar?

33:44.972 --> 33:47.372
Where do you go in Seattle?

33:47.374 --> 33:49.608
Uh, Eagle.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.610
Have you heard of it?

33:52.145 --> 33:54.604
We have an Eagle here
in Atlanta, you should go.

33:56.416 --> 33:57.583
I will.

34:06.493 --> 34:08.427
This is exactly what I needed.

34:08.429 --> 34:10.329
Thank you for getting me
out of the house.

34:10.331 --> 34:13.599
Oh, thank you for elevating
the cool factor of the party.

34:15.534 --> 34:16.969
Would you please wear
that dress again.

34:16.971 --> 34:19.004
You're giving me stirrings?

34:19.005 --> 34:20.304
Stirrings?

34:20.306 --> 34:23.108
Wow, you really like
to use your vocabulary words.

34:23.110 --> 34:24.342
There's a few words
I can come up with

34:24.344 --> 34:26.411
to describe what I'd like
to do with you in that dress

34:26.413 --> 34:28.045
right here in front
of everybody.

34:28.047 --> 34:29.281
Uh, you know,

34:29.283 --> 34:32.351
I think I feel safer
around you over the phone.

34:32.353 --> 34:35.353
Oxymoron, I heard it,
I know, thank you.

34:35.356 --> 34:36.822
I haven't been
drinking, have I?

34:36.824 --> 34:38.257
Oh, just a touch.

34:40.293 --> 34:41.460
What I mean to say is

34:41.462 --> 34:43.996
I'm relationship whipped.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.264
I don't wanna rush
into anything.

34:46.266 --> 34:49.368
You're in luck,
I'm a patient man.

34:49.370 --> 34:51.335
And you're well worth the wait.

34:52.871 --> 34:54.206
Drink up, have fun.

34:54.208 --> 34:57.776
If you have too much,
I'll call you a car.

34:57.778 --> 35:01.380
Well, then, please have
your server pour me another.

35:01.382 --> 35:02.614
