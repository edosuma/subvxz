WEBVTT

00:05.099 --> 00:06.033
No!

00:06.033 --> 00:07.566
I'll always love you, Melinda.

00:07.633 --> 00:10.367
Please. not you.

00:10.432 --> 00:11.666
You have to cross over.

00:11.733 --> 00:13.566
I don't want to.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.933
Jim, no!

00:19.200 --> 00:20.399
You're back.

00:20.466 --> 00:21.900
Do I know you?

00:21.966 --> 00:23.516
I see the same guy that you see,

00:23.516 --> 00:25.066
Different hair, nose, eyes.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.566
It's not Jim. he's in there somewhere.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.267
He just has to be.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.382
You're not gonna tell me that you think

00:30.382 --> 00:31.432
I'm your husband reincarnated.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.133
Because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.900
It's not much. but maybe you can help me finish my garage.

00:36.966 --> 00:38.466
And you could live there while you do the work.

00:38.532 --> 00:40.733
Just until you figure out your next move.

00:40.799 --> 00:42.066
Do you know how lucky you are?

00:42.133 --> 00:45.399
You are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.

00:45.466 --> 00:47.566
That's strange. I've been hoping for a clue,

00:47.633 --> 00:49.399
Something to tell me who I was.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.699
Guess I got more than I bargained for.

00:51.766 --> 00:53.566
I bought that less than a month ago.

00:53.633 --> 00:56.766
Question is... who did I buy it for?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:18.966 --> 01:20.466
Hey!

01:20.532 --> 01:22.267
Hey. you're looking chipper this morning.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.499
That's how a morning off effects me.

01:24.566 --> 01:25.833
Oh, yeah. you got a little...

01:26.966 --> 01:28.666
- Thank you.  - Yeah, sure.

01:28.733 --> 01:30.833
Where you running off to?

01:30.900 --> 01:34.300
The farmer's market. we're supposed to meet Delia there at 9:00.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.166
We are?

01:36.233 --> 01:39.633
Oh, that's right.

01:39.699 --> 01:43.900
Melinda, I'm so sorry. I gotta do a job.

01:43.966 --> 01:47.566
Yeah...yeah. anything interesting?

01:47.633 --> 01:51.799
Well, if you call making kitchen cabinets interesting, then yeah.

01:51.866 --> 01:55.166
Cabinets are great. I mean, I love cabinets.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.033
You found that...that ring...

02:01.100 --> 02:03.499
Did you ever look into it?

02:04.633 --> 02:06.699
Right. yeah.

02:06.766 --> 02:07.833
- The ring...  - Right.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.000
Did you find out anything?

02:12.566 --> 02:15.933
You don't want to know. sorry.

02:18.633 --> 02:22.367
Of course I want to know. that's all I want...is to know.

02:22.432 --> 02:24.666
Charlie used to say that. drove me nuts.

02:24.733 --> 02:27.066
Jim never did. because Jim was never a question dodger.

02:27.133 --> 02:29.399
What does that even mean, "you don't want to know"?

02:29.466 --> 02:32.367
Well, with Charlie it either meant that he didn't want to talk about it,

02:32.432 --> 02:34.066
Or he didn't want me to talk about it,

02:34.133 --> 02:37.633
Or that he actually wanted to talk, but wasn't sure if I did.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.900
Well, thank you. that's helpful.

02:38.966 --> 02:40.933
So, what do you think Sammeant?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.516
What else could he mean?

02:42.516 --> 02:44.033
He found her...his girlfriend,

02:44.100 --> 02:46.166
His soon-to-be future wife.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.466
That's why he blew me off today.

02:47.532 --> 02:49.267
That's why he's been  so distracted lately.

02:49.333 --> 02:50.532
Because he found her.

02:50.599 --> 02:51.833
And he's probably gonna get on a plane.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.432
He's gonna fly all the way to Michigan or Paris

02:53.499 --> 02:55.133
Or wherever it is she is right now.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.866
Mel, I seriously doubt that Jim's spirit

02:57.933 --> 03:00.933
Would have gone through all the trouble of taking over Sam's body

03:01.000 --> 03:03.633
Just to run off with another woman.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.133
Please tell me nobody heard me say that.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.033
Yeah. but he doesn't even know that he's Jim.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.432
I mean, what if he smells her perfume

03:10.499 --> 03:13.233
And he gets confused or attracted or...

03:13.300 --> 03:15.000
Honey, you are spinning.

03:15.066 --> 03:18.267
I wouldn't have to if he wasn't dodging my questions.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.666
It's just too loaded.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.300
I mean, I don't know how to approach it...

03:22.367 --> 03:23.733
Oh, you could.

03:23.799 --> 03:25.267
That's perfect!

03:25.333 --> 03:28.599
It's not perfect. it's bruised.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.333
They all are. see?

03:32.532 --> 03:34.000
No, not again!

03:34.066 --> 03:35.233
I'm sorry. did I do that?

03:35.300 --> 03:36.799
No, it happens all the time.

03:36.866 --> 03:37.866
And you wonder why?

03:37.933 --> 03:39.733
Well if I could get some help around here!

03:39.799 --> 03:41.733
I need to get home and cook dinner.

03:41.799 --> 03:42.766
Well, maybe I can help you.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.900
Oh thank god, finally somebody with manners!

03:45.966 --> 03:47.266
You know I have been coming here every Saturday

03:47.266 --> 03:48.566
for God knows how long,

03:48.633 --> 03:52.066
All of a sudden he decides to ignore me.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.499
I don't you how long I've been waiting.

03:54.566 --> 03:56.499
How long do you think?

03:56.566 --> 03:59.833
I...I'm not sure.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.499
Let me guess, a ghost wants pie?

04:03.566 --> 04:05.166
I'm not sure what she wants.

04:05.166 --> 04:06.766
I don't even think she knows she's dead.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.532
Wait!

04:08.599 --> 04:13.699
Could I,get 4 of those? thank you.

04:13.766 --> 04:16.565
They're for you. maybe I could give you a ride home.

04:16.632 --> 04:19.699
Oh, that's so sweet. thank you.

04:19.766 --> 04:22.267
My name is Tammy. Tammy Gardner.

04:22.333 --> 04:25.367
You...you did get the organic ones, right?

04:25.432 --> 04:29.000
You know what,  I better go and check.

04:29.066 --> 04:31.933
Did you just offer to give a ride home to a ghost?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.432
Only because she doesn't realize that she's dead.

04:37.866 --> 04:39.000
Hi.

04:39.066 --> 04:41.566
Hi, I'm Melinda Gordon. Are you Mr. Gardner?

04:41.633 --> 04:43.916
Yes, I am. I'm sorry.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.200
Like I tell all you realtors, we're not selling.

04:46.267 --> 04:49.066
Actually, I'm here about your wife.

04:49.133 --> 04:53.699
My wife? oh, she's not here. she's at the market.

04:54.799 --> 04:56.267
Did something happen?

04:56.333 --> 04:58.599
How long ago did she leave?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.766
Over an hour ago. she was due back...

05:00.833 --> 05:03.166
Ah, there she is now!

05:04.766 --> 05:06.367
Hey, sweetheart.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.200
Who's she?

05:10.267 --> 05:11.866
I was getting worried.

05:11.933 --> 05:14.367
Melinda, this is my wife, Elizabeth.

05:14.432 --> 05:16.133
Unless you two know each other?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.300
No.

05:17.367 --> 05:20.699
No, the thing is I own an antique store in town,

05:20.766 --> 05:23.399
And someone left a vase on consignment,

05:23.466 --> 05:26.233
And I was just trying  to track her down.

05:26.300 --> 05:30.033
Hmm. that wasn't me. I'm sorry.

05:31.733 --> 05:34.566
You know, just so there are no mix-ups,

05:34.633 --> 05:37.416
The woman who left the vase,

05:37.416 --> 05:40.200
Her name was Tammy... Tammy Gardner.

05:41.399 --> 05:43.333
Tammy, um...

05:43.399 --> 05:47.166
Tammy was my first wife. we're divorced.

05:47.233 --> 05:51.399
Oh. you wouldn't have a recent address change for her maybe?

05:51.466 --> 05:53.166
No, I'm sorry.

05:53.233 --> 05:56.766
I haven't heard from her since she walked out on me 2 years ago.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.733
Wish I could've been more help.

05:59.799 --> 06:01.133
Good day.

06:56.199 --> 06:58.499
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.

06:58.566 --> 07:01.132
But I went by your store. but it was closed.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.800
And your address was listed ...

07:02.866 --> 07:04.232
So is my phone number.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.466
I know, I'm sorry.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.866
I wanted to see to you in person.

07:07.933 --> 07:10.700
I need you to tell me what you know about my wife.

07:16.433 --> 07:17.967
When exactly did she leave?

07:18.033 --> 07:22.000
Just about 2 years ago, October 15.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.800
I remember that day because it was our fourth anniversary.

07:24.866 --> 07:26.700
At first I wasn't worried.

07:26.766 --> 07:29.266
She'd disappeared before. sort of a pattern for her.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.933
But she'd always come back after a couple of days.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.166
When she didn't show up after 3 days,

07:35.232 --> 07:37.199
I knew something was wrong.

07:37.266 --> 07:40.099
I just can't understand why she hasn't contacted me.

07:40.133 --> 07:43.066
You said this was a pattern? her disappearing?

07:43.133 --> 07:45.700
Maybe in a way it's good she hasn't contacted me.

07:45.767 --> 07:48.333
Means she's probably staying out of trouble.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.300
What kind of trouble?

07:50.366 --> 07:52.667
She had mood swings.

07:52.733 --> 07:53.767
What did she do?

07:53.833 --> 07:57.000
She couldn't stand feeling confined.

07:57.066 --> 07:59.833
She'd run away, then come back,

07:59.900 --> 08:02.199
Looking disheveled and confused.

08:02.266 --> 08:05.034
That doesn't sound at all like the Tammy I met.

08:05.099 --> 08:06.800
That's part of the illness.

08:06.867 --> 08:09.567
I mean, she could be delightful and happy one day,

08:09.633 --> 08:11.900
And then...and then depressed and angry the next.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.000
Was she ever diagnosed?

08:13.066 --> 08:15.333
Oh, no. no. she refused to see a doctor.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.733
I talked to plenty myself.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.000
Said it was some sort of bipolar disorder.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.000
I loved her so much.

08:25.066 --> 08:28.000
But it's so painful living with someone

08:28.066 --> 08:31.300
You can't break through to.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.667
I know what you mean.

08:37.732 --> 08:38.774
Why didn't you tell that poor guy

08:38.775 --> 08:40.070
That his ex-wife is haunting him?

08:40.198 --> 08:41.667
Because I don't want to make things worse...

08:41.732 --> 08:43.732
Roger's already got a ghost in his house because of me.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.433
Besides, I need a little more information, like how she died.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.897
Do you still think there's a chance

08:48.898 --> 08:49.898
that she could've moved on?

08:49.900 --> 08:52.233
I can hope. something tells me she'll be here soon.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.233
Because this is where I saw her yesterday.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.233
Which would tell us she's still stuck in the loop,

08:56.300 --> 08:58.099
Still playing Suzie homemaker.

08:58.286 --> 09:00.333
I'm just wondering if her imprint has something to do with

09:00.334 --> 09:01.900
mental illness and not her death.

09:01.967 --> 09:04.967
She's stuck in a loop because she's loopy? makes sense.

09:05.034 --> 09:06.366
You're not helping.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.533
No, it does. really.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.066
People in the manic stage of bipolar disorder

09:09.133 --> 09:11.366
Often have trouble assimilating anything negative...

09:11.433 --> 09:13.900
Like being dead, for instance?

09:16.667 --> 09:19.099
That's the fourth person you let go before me.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.099
I just need my husband's shirt...

09:21.166 --> 09:23.034
It's the blue one  in the plastic,

09:23.099 --> 09:25.000
And I said no plastic.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Hi.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.700
- Ok. 3 pieces.  - Thanks.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.066
Somebody help!

09:43.133 --> 09:44.400
Stop this thing!

09:44.466 --> 09:46.533
Somebody help!

09:46.600 --> 09:50.533
Tammy! stop it!

09:52.833 --> 09:56.013
Oh, I'm so glad you're here!It's a blue shirt,

09:56.014 --> 09:57.600
and Roger likes light starch if you could just...

09:57.667 --> 10:01.733
We are not gonna pick up your husband's dry cleaning.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.667
You don't need to take care of him anymore.

10:03.733 --> 10:04.934
It's time for you to move on.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.166
I can't do that.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.099
What would happen to my family?

10:08.166 --> 10:10.466
I need to take care of them, of Roger.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.233
No, you don't. they'll be fine ...

10:12.300 --> 10:16.066
Stop it. Don't say that. Roger needs me.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.833
He has a new wife.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.800
Ok? he's moved on.

10:19.867 --> 10:22.233
You can let go now, really. it's ok.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.700
Why are you being so mean? You helped me before.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.433
Why can't you help me now?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.300
Make those people listen to me!

10:28.366 --> 10:30.466
They can't. not anymore.

10:30.533 --> 10:31.686
The day that they stopped hearing you

10:31.687 --> 10:32.687
Was the day that you died.

10:33.266 --> 10:38.099
Look, you know, don't you? what happened?

10:40.034 --> 10:41.967
Oh dear...

10:42.034 --> 10:44.633
There was something...

10:46.733 --> 10:51.177
It happened after I fell asleep.I remember thinking

10:51.178 --> 10:54.266
It was strange how fast I was falling asleep.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.967
And then what happened?

10:57.034 --> 10:58.567
I was floating.

10:58.633 --> 11:02.533
There was a big grassy field

11:02.600 --> 11:05.500
And lots of tall trees below me.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.333
My car was there.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.567
And colors,

11:09.633 --> 11:13.733
Lots of bright colors flying all around me.

11:17.166 --> 11:20.034
Oh, no...I have to get home.

11:24.199 --> 11:27.533
Lots of colors? sounds like a hallucination.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.934
Yeah or maybe not.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.934
She said that she was above a field,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.934
There were tall trees.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.500
She disappeared in October.

11:38.118 --> 11:39.559
Is this what you saw that day, Tammy?

11:39.560 --> 11:43.800
Kites? floating colors? Am I close?

11:43.867 --> 11:48.099
Hot? cold? lukewarm?

11:49.967 --> 11:53.633
Crap. need some dialogue here,

11:53.700 --> 11:55.800
A little back and forth.

11:55.867 --> 12:00.667
It's not so easy when you have a client that's invisible.

12:00.733 --> 12:04.166
Ok, I've hiked far enough.

12:04.233 --> 12:07.066
And I draw the line at thistles.

12:12.466 --> 12:17.762
What's that? look, I'm sweating now.

12:17.763 --> 12:20.012
So if it turns out to be another dead end...

12:58.800 --> 13:01.900
No. no!

13:02.800 --> 13:04.767
This can't be true.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.900
I can't be dead. not like this.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.349
I told my friend detective Blair

13:12.349 --> 13:13.766
that I found the body hiking,

13:13.766 --> 13:15.233
As opposed to breaking and entering,

13:15.300 --> 13:17.238
Which is how I found the last dead body

13:17.239 --> 13:18.239
That I called into her.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.361
How many times can you do that

13:19.362 --> 13:20.197
Before they haul you away?

13:20.198 --> 13:21.433
Well, they haven't locked me up yet.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.466
That's wildly reassuring. that's nice.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.967
At least now we know how and when she died.

13:27.033 --> 13:31.033
Possibly why she's stuck here...out of guilt.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.100
Because she abandoned her husband and kids?

13:33.167 --> 13:35.866
Yeah. maybe that's why she's trying so hard now

13:35.867 --> 13:36.867
To take care of them.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.789
I just don't understand

13:38.790 --> 13:39.998
Why this ghost is so hard to get through to.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.703
I mean, she's seen  her husband's new wife,

13:41.704 --> 13:43.301
Her own dead body...

13:43.302 --> 13:45.366
You'd think that would bring up something. but it hasn't it.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.100
If she's drawn to that square,

13:47.167 --> 13:48.172
Maybe something happened  there

13:48.173 --> 13:49.209
That she doesn't  want to remember.

13:49.210 --> 13:50.600
Like, an affair?

13:50.666 --> 13:52.466
Roger said she used to disappear a lot,

13:52.533 --> 13:53.900
Maybe she was meeting someone there.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.628
Right, maybe she was seeing someone

13:56.629 --> 13:57.428
And her husband never knew.

13:57.429 --> 13:59.900
Yeah. or he did, and didn't want to believe it.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.100
Hey, Roger.

14:32.167 --> 14:35.433
It's Melinda Gordon. I was hoping we could talk.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.633
So, call me. ok. thanks.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.499
I don't know what's happening to me.

14:48.566 --> 14:52.733
I see that woman in my house. something's very wrong.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.600
It's because you don't belong there anymore.

14:54.666 --> 14:57.566
And you know that somewhere deep down.

14:57.633 --> 15:00.000
You left the house. and that's hard.

15:00.067 --> 15:03.967
But you really have to remember why.

15:04.033 --> 15:08.833
I remember... trying to make Roger happy.

15:08.900 --> 15:12.717
How I felt like it was the most important thing

15:12.718 --> 15:13.718
I could ever do.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.666
And...and how I'd always worry about my kids.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.234
I don't... I don't have any kids.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.766
But I used to feel that way about my husband.

15:27.833 --> 15:33.142
Spirits often don't remember things

15:33.143 --> 15:34.760
because somewhere deep down,

15:34.762 --> 15:35.466
They don't want to.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.533
Why wouldn't I want to?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.533
Usually guilt.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.100
You talk about your family a lot.

15:41.167 --> 15:43.033
Maybe that's what you feel guilty about? Or maybe...

15:43.100 --> 15:48.300
maybe you just need to say goodbye to your children.

15:48.366 --> 15:51.833
I don't know. God.

15:51.900 --> 15:56.000
I can't think about it anymore.

15:56.067 --> 15:58.766
I have to get home.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.433
I can't be late.

16:20.766 --> 16:24.200
Hey, what's up? Come on in.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.967
Oh, thanks.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.933
You look like you're running off.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.933
Yeah, it's really urgent.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.366
What is?

16:31.433 --> 16:33.200
I have to get to the laundromat

16:33.267 --> 16:34.700
before every T-shirt I own

16:34.700 --> 16:36.133
starts standing up by itself.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.967
Oh, so that's your...

16:38.033 --> 16:40.000
You're not planning a trip?

16:40.067 --> 16:41.433
No. why? You trying to get rid of me?

16:41.499 --> 16:44.867
No...no, it's just that, uh...

16:44.933 --> 16:48.433
My mom might come, and she stays here...

16:48.499 --> 16:49.867
Here in the garage?

16:49.933 --> 16:51.433
Allergy thing.

16:51.499 --> 16:54.716
So if you were gonna plan a trip to,

16:54.716 --> 16:57.933
I don't know, Paris or Michigan.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.933
I would need a heads-up.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.433
Ok.

17:01.499 --> 17:02.883
Well, the contractor guy I work for

17:02.883 --> 17:04.267
has got a spare room

17:04.334 --> 17:06.500
No. No. No. Cause,

17:06.500 --> 17:08.665
cause you know, she might not come.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.000
You know what?

17:11.067 --> 17:13.233
Your mom lives just over in Hamilton.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.833
Right. Right. Which is why

17:15.833 --> 17:18.366
she might not stay over.

17:18.433 --> 17:21.099
So you should stay put.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.979
You know, the doctors didn't tell me if my

17:24.979 --> 17:26.766
subtext decoder was damaged in that accident

17:26.833 --> 17:29.900
But are you're trying to tell me something?

17:29.900 --> 17:31.766
No.

17:31.766 --> 17:34.033
Yes.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.799
Yes. I just realized that

17:36.799 --> 17:39.499
I have a washer and dryer inside.

17:39.566 --> 17:42.633
And you could use them.

17:50.267 --> 17:51.234
Thank you.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.200
Delia, I was an absolute idiot.

17:55.267 --> 17:57.633
No, there's no need to coddle me, I was there.

17:57.700 --> 17:58.666
I was an idiot.

17:58.733 --> 18:00.733
I'm at Roger's house.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.133
I just want to, I don't know, feel him out,

18:03.200 --> 18:05.066
See if he ever suspected

18:05.066 --> 18:06.933
Tammy of any kind of affair.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

18:09.867 --> 18:10.950
Listen, you know what?

18:10.950 --> 18:12.033
I'll talk to you soon, ok? bye.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.167
Excuse me.

18:14.234 --> 18:15.900
Do you know the kids who live in this house?

18:15.967 --> 18:17.300
There's no kids there,

18:17.300 --> 18:18.633
just that lady and her husband.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.700
Oh. Do you ever remember there

18:19.700 --> 18:20.700
ever being kids in this house?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.867
Nope. Never. And we've lived here forever.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.234
Ok. Thanks.

18:32.533 --> 18:33.916
This isn't a good time.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.300
I'm about to be arrested.

18:35.366 --> 18:37.067
Det. Blair asked me to come down.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.700
I guess she wants to read me my rights

18:38.766 --> 18:40.234
Yeah. There are no kids.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.933
- Where?  - At Roger's house.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.516
One of the neighborhood kids said

18:43.516 --> 18:45.033
they've never seen any kids.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.800
Wait. Tammy always talked about family,

18:46.801 --> 18:47.366
I assumed...

18:47.433 --> 18:49.334
Yeah, so did I. But it never dawned on me

18:49.399 --> 18:51.399
That they may not be Roger's kids.

18:51.466 --> 18:53.399
I mean, maybe she was married before.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.499
So where's the family

18:54.499 --> 18:55.533
she's always been talking about?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.183
That's what I was hoping you

18:57.183 --> 18:58.766
could ask Det. Blair.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.683
I gotta go,

19:02.683 --> 19:04.766
If you don't hear from me,bring bail.

19:07.867 --> 19:08.800
Have a seat.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.300
I had nothing to do with it.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.833
What?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.199
I found another dead body,

19:13.199 --> 19:14.499
You want to arrest me, admit it.

19:14.566 --> 19:16.200
Look, you're a talented profiler.

19:16.267 --> 19:17.550
You help me solve cases.

19:17.550 --> 19:18.833
I don't care how it works.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.300
Oh. Ok.

19:23.334 --> 19:26.167
So, uh, was it a suicide?

19:26.234 --> 19:28.067
Well, it looks that way.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.816
The dental records confirmed

19:29.816 --> 19:31.499
the woman was a Tammy Gardner.

19:31.566 --> 19:33.334
Her husband's been informed.

19:33.399 --> 19:34.666
What about her kids?

19:34.666 --> 19:35.933
Do you have any records of the children?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.300
No.

19:37.366 --> 19:38.649
Says here the only family

19:38.649 --> 19:39.933
she had was a Roger Gardner.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.067
He filed  the missing person's report.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.967
But Sarah Evers had 2 children.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.100
Who?

19:46.167 --> 19:48.133
Well, that's why I called you down here.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.769
The dental records also matched a woman

19:49.769 --> 19:50.734
who's husband reported

19:50.734 --> 19:51.700
her missing 6 years ago

19:51.766 --> 19:52.900
Sarah Evers.

19:52.967 --> 19:54.283
Wait. So, Tammy was also Sarah?

19:54.283 --> 19:55.600
She had 2 identities?

19:55.666 --> 19:57.334
Maybe more. We don't know yet.

19:57.399 --> 19:58.867
So, does the first husband know?

19:58.933 --> 20:00.766
Well, we're still trying to track him,

20:00.766 --> 20:02.600
see what his story is.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.334
Did Sarah's family live nearby?

20:10.633 --> 20:12.266
Thomas Evers filed the missing

20:12.266 --> 20:13.900
person's report from Lake Forest.

20:13.967 --> 20:15.300
That's 3 counties over.

20:22.334 --> 20:24.833
They don't know about their mom yet.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.200
Haven't had the heart to tell them.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.967
I never thought it would end like this.

20:31.133 --> 20:32.399
Even after all these years,

20:32.466 --> 20:35.967
I always thought she'd come back.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.766
So, you said you were a friend of Sarah's?

20:38.833 --> 20:41.067
When she lived in Grandview.

20:41.133 --> 20:42.466
Right.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.583
I'll tell you what, when she left me,

20:44.583 --> 20:46.633
I was blindsided.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.600
I never saw it coming.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.234
There were no signs of trouble?

20:50.300 --> 20:52.533
No.

20:53.433 --> 20:57.399
We were happy or so I thought.

20:59.167 --> 21:01.017
Apparently everyone knew

21:01.017 --> 21:02.867
what was really going on but me.

21:02.933 --> 21:04.300
What do you mean?

21:04.366 --> 21:07.199
After she left, the neighbors said

21:07.199 --> 21:10.033
they'd suspected something.

21:11.167 --> 21:14.433
We had an electrician, did some work for us.

21:16.267 --> 21:20.900
Said things that made them think affair.

21:20.967 --> 21:23.533
Turns out, it was.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.633
About a month later I get a postcard,

21:25.633 --> 21:27.666
saying she's never coming back.

21:27.733 --> 21:30.300
That must've been devastating.

21:30.366 --> 21:31.566
You have no idea.

21:31.633 --> 21:34.200
Especially for the boys...

21:34.267 --> 21:36.567
7 and 10 at the time...

21:36.567 --> 21:38.867
Their mother abandoned them.

21:46.033 --> 21:48.566
I wanted to grow old with her so bad.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.366
What did I do?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.100
You ready?

22:29.267 --> 22:31.466
I left them for Roger.

22:37.833 --> 22:39.233
Sam!

22:42.833 --> 22:45.067
Hey, Sam!

22:45.134 --> 22:46.900
Sam!

22:50.299 --> 22:51.299
Sam, hi.

22:51.366 --> 22:53.500
Oh, sorry.

22:54.867 --> 22:57.433
I just, uh...I brought this stuff by for Mel.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.733
It's just got some fixtures in it for the remodel.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
Great. Thanks.

23:00.867 --> 23:01.867
Sorry about the racket.

23:01.933 --> 23:03.266
Oh, yeah. I understand.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.316
You're just cranking it up

23:04.316 --> 23:05.299
when the landlady's away.

23:05.366 --> 23:06.967
Right. I know it's juvenile.

23:07.034 --> 23:08.717
But it works perfectly when

23:08.717 --> 23:10.400
you're trying to take your mind of things.

23:10.466 --> 23:12.233
You want some water? Fruit juice? Anything?

23:12.299 --> 23:13.566
Yeah. Sure. Some water.

23:13.633 --> 23:15.667
And what kind of things?

23:15.733 --> 23:18.350
Or is it something

23:18.350 --> 23:20.967
you don't want to talk about?

23:21.034 --> 23:23.067
I'm sure Melinda's told you

23:23.067 --> 23:25.100
about this engagement ring.

23:25.166 --> 23:27.067
Yeah. She mentioned it.

23:27.134 --> 23:28.767
I really appreciate her concern.

23:28.833 --> 23:31.533
But I feel weird talking to her about it.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.966
Because I know she's got

23:32.966 --> 23:34.333
a lot going on in her life.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.750
I think that she just

23:35.750 --> 23:37.100
wants to make sure you're ok.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.100
You know, I'm ok.

23:40.166 --> 23:44.667
So are you thinking about going to look for her?

23:48.767 --> 23:52.067
Yeah. But what do I say to her when I find her?

23:52.134 --> 23:53.317
"Hi, I was about I was going to

23:53.317 --> 23:54.500
propose marriage to you,

23:54.566 --> 23:56.700
but I've got a serious head injury.

23:56.767 --> 23:58.833
But by the way, was it chicken

23:58.833 --> 24:00.900
or fish for the wedding?"

24:00.967 --> 24:04.433
Yeah. I suppose that would be kinda awkward.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.883
I mean, I already broke my family's heart

24:05.883 --> 24:07.266
by not remembering them.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.700
Do I really need to add to the body count?

24:10.967 --> 24:15.100
And besides, if this woman is the love of my life,

24:15.166 --> 24:18.166
How come she hasn't found me?

24:18.233 --> 24:19.733
I don't know why I kept all this stuff.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.900
It's hard letting go.

24:21.967 --> 24:24.366
I guess some part of me was hoping she was ok,

24:24.433 --> 24:27.266
And that she'd want her things back one day.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.466
How is Elizabeth dealing with the news?

24:29.533 --> 24:30.900
Well, it's been hard.

24:30.967 --> 24:32.867
It's part of the reason I'm out here.

24:32.933 --> 24:36.933
I figured it's time to put the past behind us, you know?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.600
So if this is about the vase, you can go ahead and keep it.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.366
No. actually it's not about that.

24:41.433 --> 24:43.266
It's about Tammy.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.100
I think it's time for her to move on as well.

24:45.166 --> 24:47.266
What do you mean?

24:47.333 --> 24:51.233
I have a gift. I see earthbound spirits.

24:51.299 --> 24:53.867
And I've seen Tammy. she's confused.

24:53.933 --> 24:56.134
She has no memory about what happened to her.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.600
Is this some kind of joke?

24:57.667 --> 24:59.266
I know how it must sound.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.116
Ghosts that get stuck here like Tammy,

25:01.116 --> 25:02.900
It's usually because of guilt.

25:02.967 --> 25:04.617
I think hers has to do with the fact

25:04.617 --> 25:06.633
That she left her husband and boys for you.

25:07.967 --> 25:10.400
Look, I don't know what you're after,

25:10.466 --> 25:13.333
Or how you even know that.

25:13.400 --> 25:18.134
But taking Tammy from her boys is not something I'm proud of.

25:18.199 --> 25:20.667
We fell in love. passionately in love.

25:20.733 --> 25:23.233
Didn't mean to. just happened.

25:23.299 --> 25:25.433
But lots of people get divorced.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.767
Not so many flee in the middle of the night.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.767
Lots of people don't have husbands like Thomas.

25:29.833 --> 25:32.767
What does that mean?

25:32.833 --> 25:35.067
Tammy made him out to be pretty awful.

25:35.134 --> 25:39.299
But now, you know, I'm not really sure about anything.

25:39.366 --> 25:41.700
Because she left you, too.

25:44.633 --> 25:48.366
Look. it doesn't matter anymore. she's dead.

25:48.433 --> 25:51.134
I tried to help her find peace when she was alive.

25:51.199 --> 25:55.034
I tried to give her a good life. but I couldn't.

25:55.100 --> 25:58.034
I guess nobody could.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.967
He's all torn up. he doesn't want anyone else to get hurt

26:01.034 --> 26:03.833
So he's doing what men do best... avoiding it.

26:03.900 --> 26:06.400
So he hasn't found her? or even started looking for her?

26:06.466 --> 26:07.400
Nope.

26:07.466 --> 26:08.767
Well, at least that buys me some time.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.767
Although his fiancee could still show up at any minute.

26:11.833 --> 26:15.433
Hey, by then Sam will have remembered that he's Jim.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.266
And you will live happily ever after. right?

26:19.333 --> 26:23.067
Hey. hand me that box. I'll take it out to the recycling bin.

26:23.134 --> 26:27.500
I can see now... how I left my boys, my family.

26:27.566 --> 26:32.034
But I can't remember why. what happened?

26:32.100 --> 26:35.667
You're the only one who knows. try and think back.

26:35.733 --> 26:37.967
You left Thomas,  and then you left Roger, too.

26:38.034 --> 26:40.366
I know you say that, but that couldn't have happened.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.700
I'd never leave Roger.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.566
Please. why can't I remember?

26:47.134 --> 26:51.034
What happened? did someone do that to you?

27:00.700 --> 27:02.500
Sweetheart, you poor thing.

27:02.566 --> 27:06.333
It's ok. I'm here now.

27:10.633 --> 27:13.233
I don't know how that happened.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.333
Was it Thomas?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.566
Cause Roger said that he didn't treat you very well.

27:18.633 --> 27:22.400
Or was it Roger? or someone else?

27:22.466 --> 27:26.166
No. Roger would never hurt me. he always took care of me.

27:26.233 --> 27:29.233
Ok. well, either way, it's something Roger knows about you.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.833
Maybe he talked to Elizabeth.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.400
His new wife?

27:32.466 --> 27:37.667
Well, she had to have asked about you, about what happened.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.767
You've been hanging around the old house.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.233
Is Elizabeth home right now?

27:42.299 --> 27:45.100
No. she went out.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.100
She's at the farmer's market.

27:56.034 --> 27:59.333
Hi, I was at your house the other day.

28:00.266 --> 28:02.100
Melinda, right?

28:02.166 --> 28:05.633
Sorry to bother you. I know this is a difficult time.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.700
I'm sorry? what do you mean?

28:07.767 --> 28:11.199
Well, Roger must be upset about his first wife.

28:11.266 --> 28:12.500
What are you talking about?

28:12.566 --> 28:15.800
Tammy's dead.

28:15.867 --> 28:18.466
They found her body yesterday.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.933
How did...how did... what happened?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.166
They're calling it a suicide.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.600
But she had bruises on her wrists.

28:30.533 --> 28:32.366
I think she was abused.

28:33.566 --> 28:35.067
Did she tell you that?

28:35.134 --> 28:38.733
No, she just looked really scared.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.266
Like you do right now.

28:46.366 --> 28:49.933
I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told her.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.466
You're not alone.

28:51.533 --> 28:55.034
There are people that can help.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.900
I can help.

28:57.967 --> 29:00.299
It's safe to talk to me.

29:04.366 --> 29:07.833
I'm sorry. I have to get home. I can't be late.

29:08.767 --> 29:10.366
Elizabeth!

29:10.433 --> 29:12.500
Elizabeth!

29:17.667 --> 29:20.366
You're starting to remember, aren't you?

29:20.433 --> 29:23.500
I was just like her.

29:23.566 --> 29:25.833
I was so scared. I was in such a dark place.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.566
You were abused, of course you were in a dark place.

29:28.633 --> 29:32.000
No. no.

29:34.333 --> 29:38.433
I was in a really dark place.

29:53.299 --> 29:55.266
Tammy?

29:57.733 --> 30:01.166
I don't know how long I'd been in there.

30:01.233 --> 30:04.100
It seemed like forever.

30:04.166 --> 30:06.383
So, after you left your husband,

30:06.383 --> 30:08.600
Is that how Roger would punish you?

30:08.667 --> 30:10.700
No.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.967
That's where Roger kept me after he kidnapped me.

30:25.133 --> 30:28.200
And that he could  make me happy.

30:28.267 --> 30:30.300
Was there something going on between you two?

30:30.367 --> 30:32.467
No! I barely knew him.

30:32.533 --> 30:36.400
He was...he was just some guy doing work on our house.

30:36.467 --> 30:39.567
But the neighbors told your husband they suspected something.

30:39.634 --> 30:41.066
I remember seeing him talking to them.

30:41.133 --> 30:45.734
I just...i just thought he was just trying to round up more work.

30:45.799 --> 30:50.066
So he wanted them to suspect something to cover his tracks.

30:50.133 --> 30:52.634
What happened after he locked you up?

30:52.700 --> 30:55.500
I lost count of the days.

30:57.300 --> 31:00.400
I thought I was losing my mind.

31:00.467 --> 31:04.533
I remember hearing my boys' voices.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.166
I couldn't tell what was real anymore.

31:08.233 --> 31:13.766
Then one day, it all just changed.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.866
Upsy-daisey. there we go.

31:16.933 --> 31:21.333
Ooh, these are a little tight, huh?

31:24.166 --> 31:29.133
Suddenly he was so kind and caring.

31:34.166 --> 31:35.433
It's ok.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.467
At first it was just food.

31:37.533 --> 31:39.400
And then it was bigger things.

31:39.467 --> 31:42.734
Like letting me go outside.

31:42.799 --> 31:46.833
Eventually he let me take trips to the market alone.

31:48.966 --> 31:51.133
So you started to trust him.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.899
Oh God, how could I have?!

31:52.966 --> 31:54.734
You were brainwashed.

31:54.799 --> 31:56.333
It happens.  I don't know why.

31:56.400 --> 32:01.734
It's called stockholm syndrome.

32:01.799 --> 32:03.734
Did you ever try to get away?

32:03.799 --> 32:06.000
No. no!

32:06.066 --> 32:07.567
I couldn't.

32:07.634 --> 32:11.766
He threatened that if I did, he would kill my family, my boys.

32:11.833 --> 32:14.033
So the only escape was to kill yourself.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.100
No, I wouldn't.

32:16.166 --> 32:18.833
Then what happened that day?

32:18.899 --> 32:21.933
I was at the market.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.734
For some reason I was late getting home.

32:25.799 --> 32:27.700
Hey, honey.

32:27.766 --> 32:30.267
I was worried about you.

32:30.333 --> 32:33.500
Sorry, I'm fine.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.799
No, you're not fine.

32:36.866 --> 32:38.066
What's going on, darling?

32:38.133 --> 32:42.467
Nothing, it's...nothing.

32:44.267 --> 32:49.066
You know you can't lie to me.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.716
Did something happen in town

32:51.716 --> 32:54.300
you want to tell me about? Hmm?

32:54.367 --> 32:59.233
No, I must've lost track of time.

33:00.433 --> 33:02.400
After that he told me to go upstairs and rest...

33:02.467 --> 33:05.866
That he would make me something to eat.

33:05.933 --> 33:07.166
We ate.

33:07.233 --> 33:11.300
Then, I felt sleepy.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.400
And I wanted to say something, but...

33:23.467 --> 33:27.367
But the words wouldn't come out.

33:27.433 --> 33:30.033
Roger always told me,

33:30.100 --> 33:32.267
"I decide when you leave."

33:34.500 --> 33:38.267
I guess he decided it was time.

33:40.766 --> 33:42.667
After he kidnapped and stockholmed her?

33:42.734 --> 33:44.316
That's possible. Right?

33:44.316 --> 33:45.899
I mean, I'm not making this stuff up?

33:45.966 --> 33:48.433
No, what you're describing is exactly how it works.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.367
He grabs her. He locks her up.

33:50.433 --> 33:52.533
He threatens to kill  her family if she runs.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.300
She's scared out of her wits.

33:54.367 --> 33:57.400
So what if he's doing the same thing to Elizabeth?

33:57.467 --> 33:59.233
You said Elizabeth seemed scared, which is good,

33:59.300 --> 34:00.899
That tells me she isn't completely brainwashed.

34:00.966 --> 34:02.667
Look, I want you to call Det. Blair and find out

34:02.734 --> 34:04.400
if anyone matching Elizabeth's description

34:04.467 --> 34:06.200
has gone up missing in the last year.

34:06.267 --> 34:07.516
If she has a family anywhere,

34:07.516 --> 34:08.766
we need to get them somewhere safe.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.266
And what're you gonna do?

34:10.333 --> 34:12.866
Just call me when it's done.

34:25.766 --> 34:27.734
Elizabeth, are you here?

34:35.600 --> 34:37.799
Roger spied on me sometimes.

34:37.866 --> 34:39.533
I never knew when it would be.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.983
So you're saying he could've seen me

34:41.983 --> 34:44.367
talking to Elizabeth at the market.

35:04.133 --> 35:04.900
Is someone there?

35:08.200 --> 35:08.800
Help.

35:12.200 --> 35:12.900
Help.

35:33.900 --> 35:34.500
Oh, my God.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.467
Are you ok?

35:40.233 --> 35:42.233
I'm so sorry.

36:05.299 --> 36:07.100
Stay away from her! Ahhh!

36:07.167 --> 36:09.234
Don't do this! I love you.

36:09.299 --> 36:11.500
Is that what you said to Tammy? is it?

36:11.566 --> 36:12.933
Before you killed her?!

36:13.000 --> 36:14.767
She told you that?! she's insane!

36:14.833 --> 36:16.767
She says she sees ghosts!

36:16.833 --> 36:21.666
Well, maybe she'll see yours soon!

36:21.733 --> 36:22.767
That's enough!

36:22.833 --> 36:23.933
Get out of the way!

36:24.000 --> 36:25.833
Put it down, the police are on their way. Ok?

36:25.900 --> 36:27.867
He's gonna get his punishment. Put it down.

36:27.933 --> 36:31.100
Punishment for what? having a wife?

36:31.167 --> 36:34.299
Who is gonna believe that I was held captive?

36:34.366 --> 36:36.900
They'll say I could've run. He'll get away with it.

36:36.967 --> 36:38.767
He thinks of everything.

36:38.833 --> 36:41.067
Then you have to think of everything... your family.

36:41.134 --> 36:44.533
All right, if you kill him, you're gonna get put away.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.433
And you'll be kept away from them forever.

36:47.500 --> 36:51.000
Think of your family. Put it down.

36:55.299 --> 36:58.333
Now you'll know what it feels like to be a prisoner.

37:03.733 --> 37:05.900
No, no, please. Don't leave.

37:05.900 --> 37:10.900
Help me! Please! Elizabeth!

37:21.666 --> 37:24.067
At least one of us got to go home.

37:27.666 --> 37:29.299
Thank you.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.400
I can help you talk to your family.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.967
You could say goodbye.

37:34.033 --> 37:36.583
No, they think I abandoned them.

37:36.583 --> 37:39.134
And I almost did.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.733
How could they ever forgive me?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.633
You didn't abandon them,  not really.

37:45.700 --> 37:49.600
There was always a piece of you that remembered.

37:51.933 --> 37:55.633
I got your personal effects from the station.

37:55.700 --> 37:59.433
I almost missed this, it was folded so many times.

38:05.134 --> 38:07.700
That's my little boy.

38:07.767 --> 38:09.867
That's Rich.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.167
That's why I was late that night.

38:24.700 --> 38:28.433
I stared at that picture for hours.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.333
My heart just aching.

38:32.399 --> 38:36.600
You must've put it in your wallet that day.

38:36.666 --> 38:38.700
Roger knew that you were covering something.

38:38.767 --> 38:40.533
He knew that he was losing control.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.867
And he just couldn't let that happen.

38:42.933 --> 38:45.033
Let's go home.

38:48.033 --> 38:50.234
Do me a favor, get your brother a soda, ok?

38:50.299 --> 38:52.433
Thanks.

38:52.500 --> 38:57.666
So you're saying you talked with my wife's spirit.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.933
That's why you came to me first.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.299
That's, uh...

39:03.366 --> 39:06.134
Crazy. Yeah, I know.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.800
Um, Tammy...

39:08.867 --> 39:11.900
Sarah, she needed some answers about things.

39:11.967 --> 39:15.000
She couldn't remember what happened to her.

39:15.067 --> 39:16.366
And now she does.

39:16.433 --> 39:18.100
I'm so sorry, Thomas.

39:18.167 --> 39:21.867
I wanted to grow old with you, too.

39:23.067 --> 39:27.033
I wanted to see Joe  hit his first grand slam,

39:27.100 --> 39:28.867
And Rich get his braces off

39:28.933 --> 39:33.033
And I wanted to buy that houseboat on the lake

39:33.100 --> 39:37.067
And fill it with grandkids just like we talked about.

39:37.134 --> 39:39.800
She says there's so much that she wanted to do with you,

39:39.867 --> 39:42.433
The houseboat on the lake.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.666
How did you know about that?

39:44.733 --> 39:46.299
We had this joke.

39:46.366 --> 39:50.033
We were gonna name the boat,  2 old coots.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.399
2 old coots?

39:57.299 --> 40:01.533
She's really here, isn't she?

40:01.600 --> 40:04.466
Oh God, she must hate me.

40:04.533 --> 40:06.500
I just left her there!

40:06.566 --> 40:10.299
6 years and I never went after her.

40:10.366 --> 40:13.566
I should've looked harder for her.

40:13.633 --> 40:16.967
All she went through. I did nothing.

40:17.033 --> 40:20.399
How can I forgive myself?

40:20.466 --> 40:25.500
You have to. please tell him that.

40:25.566 --> 40:29.000
Roger kept me prisoner for so long.

40:29.067 --> 40:32.900
He used guilt, fear, remorse to keep me tied up.

40:32.967 --> 40:35.666
Don't let him do that to you,

40:35.666 --> 40:38.366
don't give him that victory.

40:38.433 --> 40:40.500
I'm free now.

40:40.566 --> 40:43.500
I want you to be, too.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.733
She needs that to move on,

40:45.800 --> 40:48.333
to know that you're free, like she is.

40:48.399 --> 40:53.167
I love you so much. You were our world.

40:53.234 --> 40:58.500
I know. I felt that.

40:58.566 --> 41:00.466
She knows that.

41:00.533 --> 41:02.850
And you did helped her

41:02.850 --> 41:05.167
even if you didn't know it.

41:05.234 --> 41:07.433
Hey, dad.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.533
Will you make sure

41:13.533 --> 41:15.466
that he tells them everything that happened?

41:17.167 --> 41:20.633
That I always loved them?

41:23.700 --> 41:26.566
I see something.

41:26.633 --> 41:27.767
It's a light.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.700
That's for you.

41:45.100 --> 41:47.234
Come here.

42:10.767 --> 42:11.733
Thanks.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.600
Anything good in there?

42:13.666 --> 42:15.633
Yeah. Huge story.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.283
Did you read about

42:17.283 --> 42:18.867
that guy who kidnapped those 2 women?

42:18.933 --> 42:21.033
Yeah. Crazy, huh?

42:21.100 --> 42:23.867
What a happy ending for the woman.

42:23.933 --> 42:25.666
Can you imagine what it was like

42:25.666 --> 42:27.399
for her to see her family again?

42:27.466 --> 42:30.000
Yeah. Thank God the police got there in time.

42:31.466 --> 42:35.200
She gets a real second chance.

42:35.266 --> 42:37.200
Kinda like me.

42:42.867 --> 42:45.266
I just can't keep carrying this thing around.

42:45.333 --> 42:49.167
I mean, I might have somebody worrying about me.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.533
Just like these women did.

42:53.633 --> 42:58.033
And if you find that person, what then?

43:03.399 --> 43:05.167
I don't know...
