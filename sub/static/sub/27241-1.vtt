How many of you are there?

00:26.708 --> 00:28.625
Are any of them children?

00:30.208 --> 00:32.791
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

It's gonna feel like
it's going on for a long time,

-What the fuck is what?

11:46.666 --> 11:48.333
[people screaming]

11:48.416 --> 11:49.583
What the fuck is what?

11:49.666 --> 11:50.791
[Jessica panting]

11:50.875 --> 11:52.708
What the fuck is what?
What are you looking at?

11:52.791 --> 11:55.041
What did you see? Talk to me.
What the fuck is what?

11:55.125 --> 11:57.541
What are you doing? Oh, my God, Jess.
Jess, don't do that.

11:57.625 --> 12:01.416
Just what are you-- What is wrong
with you? No. Stop it! Stop it!

12:01.500 --> 12:03.000
No, no, no!

12:03.083 --> 12:04.083
Stop it! Stop it!

12:04.166 --> 12:07.833
Jess, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Jess, please. Stop it, Jess.

12:07.916 --> 12:10.166
God damn it! Stop it! Please stop it!

[distorted voice]

13:27.833 --> 13:29.500
-Lydia, what are you doing?
-She's pregnant.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.750
Lydia, not now. Let's go in.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.083
She's pregnant.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.208
You can't help!

13:34.291 --> 13:35.791

-[horn honks]

13:36.458 --> 13:38.333
Hurry, come inside!

13:38.416 --> 13:39.333
Okay.

13:41.541 --> 13:42.875
[grunts]

13:42.958 --> 13:44.666
Sweetheart, get up. Right now.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.291
Mom.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.208
Please don't go.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.000
Please don't go.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.583
[distorted voice whispers]

14:02.041 --> 14:03.958
[man] Hey. Hey. Hey.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.833
Keep your eyes down.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.125
[pounding on door]

14:29.208 --> 14:31.250
[Tom] Open the door.
This woman is pregnant.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.291
-Open the door!
-No.

14:34.125 --> 14:37.208
-[Lucy] Hey! Open the door. Police.
-[Douglas] Don't open it.

14:37.291 --> 14:40.541
-[Lucy] Police! Open the fucking door!
-I'm sorry. It's my house.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.583
Get in. Hurry!

14:42.666 --> 14:44.666
Come on. You good?

14:46.708 --> 14:47.750
Are you okay?

14:47.833 --> 14:49.833
[Malorie panting]

14:55.000 --> 14:56.416
She went to help you.

14:58.666 --> 14:59.833
Now she's gone.

15:01.541 --> 15:04.375
[Greg] Come on. Now everybody's
obviously just a little freaked out.

15:04.458 --> 15:07.083
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-[Greg] Come in. Come inside the house.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.833
[Greg whispers] Come on. Come on.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.625
[Greg] Is everybody all right?

15:15.708 --> 15:18.541
Is anyone getting service in here?
You don't have any Wi-Fi?

15:18.625 --> 15:19.791
[Greg] I have not gotten any.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.250
[woman] Come on.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.583
-It's not working.
-[Jason] I gotta get a hold of my kids.

15:23.666 --> 15:25.250
-No, nothing.
-[busy signal]

15:25.333 --> 15:27.541
-[man] Honey?
-[woman] Nothing. I have nothing.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.125
-[man] They're at home?
-Excuse me.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.375
[line ringing]

15:33.875 --> 15:36.958
Mom? Mom, call me. Call me right now.

15:37.041 --> 15:39.875
Something... [sniffles] Hello? Hello?

15:39.958 --> 15:41.166
[phone beeps]

15:42.500 --> 15:46.208
That thing fucks with your nervous system.
I've seen it in my clients for weeks.

15:46.291 --> 15:48.333
Hey, did I mention I'm a fucking cop?

15:50.125 --> 15:51.958
You're in the Academy.
Doesn't make you a cop.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.666
Whatever it is,
I'm sure they'll send someone soon.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.666
No, the only thing that will happen soon
is we're all gonna die soon.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.750
This has a classic bio-warfare signature.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.583
North Korea or Iran.

16:05.666 --> 16:08.541
[Greg] Douglas, that's it.
They don't know what it is yet, okay?

16:08.625 --> 16:10.666
We just all gotta try to stay calm.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.041
-Really?
-[Lucy] Yeah.

16:12.625 --> 16:13.666
[Greg] Please.

16:15.666 --> 16:17.166
We are so fucking fucked.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.250
[Cheryl] I think I heard one.

16:19.833 --> 16:24.291
We were running up the street,
and I swear to God, I-- I felt something.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.583
-I heard something.
-[Lucy] Did you see it? What was it?

16:26.666 --> 16:29.458
-I-- I don't know. It was just there.
-[busy signal]

16:29.541 --> 16:31.208
-[Lucy] The presence?
-[Cheryl] Yeah.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.000
So fucking fucked.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.916
[distorted growl]

16:39.875 --> 16:42.666
[Lucy] Gotta be an image out there.
They must have released some video.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.416
-I haven't seen anything.
-[Tom] My crew saw one.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.375
-What?
-What?

16:46.458 --> 16:49.000
One minute,
we were digging a foundation...

16:49.666 --> 16:52.541
and then my contractor just lies down
in front of the bulldozer.

16:52.625 --> 16:56.500
And then my operator tips the rig
into the ditch and snaps his own neck.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.750
-[Cheryl] Oh.
-[Greg] It seems like if you look at it,

16:59.833 --> 17:03.458
it makes you crazy
or it makes you wanna hurt yourself.

17:04.041 --> 17:06.083
No, it makes you kill yourself.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.666
[Cheryl] And you just...
you just look at it.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.541
-[Lucy] And you commit suicide.
-[man] How can that be?

17:12.625 --> 17:15.375
Close the windows. Get the windows!
Close all the windows.

17:18.083 --> 17:21.291
-Everybody, get the windows.
-[busy signal]

17:25.166 --> 17:27.208

17:27.291 --> 17:28.875
[phone ringing]

17:28.958 --> 17:30.291
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

17:30.375 --> 17:31.833
Andy, Bailey, can you hear me?

17:31.916 --> 17:34.708
-[Bailey] Dad? What's that thing outside?
-[static]

17:34.791 --> 17:36.625
-Bailey! Bailey?
-Bailey.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.708
-[Bailey screams]
-Bailey! Bailey!

17:39.791 --> 17:42.250
-If you go outside, you'll die.
-My children are out there!

17:42.333 --> 17:44.625
-[Jason] Move!
-You won't make it to your children!

17:44.708 --> 17:48.000
-[Felix] It's back on. Turn it up.
-[reporter] The President has declared

17:48.083 --> 17:50.375
a state of emergency
and has closed all borders.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.541
Do not, do not go outside.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.666
-Avoid social media. Use radi--

17:56.458 --> 17:58.083
[static]

17:58.166 --> 18:00.500
What? What in the shit is happening?

18:00.583 --> 18:03.708
-It's an end game, man.
-[Cheryl] I'm sorry, what?

18:03.791 --> 18:07.250
The end game. Humanity has been judged,
and we've been found wanting.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.291
-[Lucy] Judged? By who?
-[Charlie] They go by different names.

18:10.958 --> 18:14.500
You got world religion and mythology
that's full of mentions of demons

18:14.583 --> 18:17.250
or spirit creatures.
People who've seen these creatures

18:17.333 --> 18:19.875
almost always describe
their encounter as this...

18:19.958 --> 18:23.208
as with an entity that takes on
a form of your worst fears or...

18:23.833 --> 18:25.833
your deepest sadness
or your greatest loss.

18:25.916 --> 18:27.833
Sounds like bullshit to me.
Religious talk.

18:27.916 --> 18:31.125
It's not bullshit, okay?
It's real talk. It's facts.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.791
They come in all different forms.

18:32.875 --> 18:37.833
You got the Aka Manah, the Varios Daevas
from ancient Zoroastrian legend.

18:37.916 --> 18:41.083
You've got the Surgat
from ancient Christian occult beliefs

18:41.166 --> 18:45.166
that made pregnant women encounter
their unborn children as other creatures

18:45.250 --> 18:46.708
such as lobsters or spiders.

18:46.791 --> 18:51.291
You've got the Huli-jing from China.
You've got the Puca from Celtic mythology.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.583
All different names, but the same thing.

18:54.666 --> 18:55.666
And what's that?

18:57.625 --> 18:58.750
The end of us.

18:59.541 --> 19:02.625
Charlie, did you learn all of that
working at the supermarket?

19:03.791 --> 19:06.916
-No, I've been studying it for years.
-In college?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.375
Not college per se, but...

19:09.458 --> 19:12.333
I mean the Internet. That's where you get
all your information from.

19:12.416 --> 19:15.208
-I'm working on a novel, guys.
-Fuck's sake.

19:15.291 --> 19:18.083
[Felix] So we can't do anything
but wait here until we go crazy like him?

19:18.166 --> 19:21.166
[Cheryl] The army is bound
to get this under control.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.041
We just have to wait.

19:23.791 --> 19:27.250
[Tom] Hey. Hey.
Why don't we sit back down?

19:27.333 --> 19:30.083
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm-- I'm just trying to make a call.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.666
-Understood.
-[Malorie] I'm okay.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.583
Understood. Understood. Um...

19:34.333 --> 19:36.875
-The phones aren't working right now.
-Okay. Okay.

19:37.791 --> 19:40.333
[Tom] Listen, are you in any pain?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.083
What? No. No.

19:43.166 --> 19:46.000
-I feel like you may have a concussion.
-I am fine. I'm fine.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.250
-Okay. Okay.
-I am fine.

19:47.833 --> 19:48.750
Okay.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.250
We were just driving.

19:59.416 --> 20:00.875
And then she saw something.

20:01.458 --> 20:05.750
I didn't see what it was,
but then she got this look on her face.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.166
[sighs]

20:13.458 --> 20:14.708
[sniffles]

20:16.458 --> 20:18.041
[weeping] It's like she got--

20:24.375 --> 20:28.416
She got so sad, and Jess does not get sad.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.041
No.

20:31.250 --> 20:34.250
She stepped out of the car
and ran into the street...

20:34.833 --> 20:36.750
and she's not suicidal. [sniffles]

20:36.833 --> 20:38.166
She would never do that.

20:39.791 --> 20:41.208
But it was...

20:41.291 --> 20:44.458
And then that woman--
that woman, she saw me,

20:44.541 --> 20:48.166
and then she started talking
to her mom and I...

20:48.250 --> 20:49.541
[sniffles]

20:49.625 --> 20:51.750
[Douglas] That woman was my wife.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.166
-Her name was Lydia.
-[Malorie] Okay.

20:54.708 --> 20:58.458
And she wasn't talking to her mother.
Her mother's been dead ten years.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.333
[wind whistles]

21:12.625 --> 21:14.375
[growl]

21:15.125 --> 21:17.125
[distorted whispering]

22:03.041 --> 22:04.375

22:16.791 --> 22:17.833

Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

22:27.833 --> 22:29.541
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.833
Is anybody out there?
Hello, my name is Malorie.

22:33.916 --> 22:35.875
I'm on the river. Is anybody out there?

22:36.708 --> 22:38.666
Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there?

22:46.250 --> 22:47.541

22:52.125 --> 22:54.708
[distorted whispers] Malorie. Malorie.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.250
[wind whistles]

22:59.958 --> 23:01.541
-Malorie.
-[growl]

23:09.708 --> 23:14.208
[man over radio] It's been three days
since these, um, events unfolded.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.708
Station's lines are down.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.916
I can't get in touch with anyone.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.666
We haven't heard anything
from any authorities...

23:20.750 --> 23:22.000
but if you are listening,

23:22.083 --> 23:25.000
from what I can gather,
as long as you stay indoors,

23:25.083 --> 23:28.250
as long as you don't look
at those things...

23:29.083 --> 23:30.500
you should be fine.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.333
Do not go outside.

23:32.416 --> 23:36.666
The moment I receive any more news,
I will be sure to update you.

23:36.750 --> 23:40.833
My husband works in trusts and estates.
What kind of law do you practice?

23:40.916 --> 23:43.791
-Bankruptcy.
-When he's not suing his neighbors.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.083
[Felix] Hey, how long's
our food gonna last?

23:46.166 --> 23:47.583
[Douglas] Not much longer.

23:47.666 --> 23:50.875
Because some of us
don't understand the concept of rationing.

23:51.541 --> 23:53.208
Douglas, your house is behind this one.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.125
When we finish this,
let's go for a food run.

23:55.208 --> 23:57.583
We'd never make it back.
What you don't understand is--

23:57.666 --> 23:59.166
[knocking on door]

24:04.916 --> 24:07.041
-[Lucy] Hey, Tom...
-We can't let anyone in.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.958
Okay, just calm down.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.000
-[Tom] Hello?
-[woman] Yes, hello.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.750
-You're making a big mistake.
-Douglas.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.666
-[Tom] Yes, hello.
-[woman] Hello?

24:18.541 --> 24:21.500
[crying] My name is Olympia.
I need help. Please.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.833
-Don't open the goddamn--
-I'm gonna open the door.

24:23.916 --> 24:24.791
[Douglas] Fuck!

24:25.291 --> 24:26.416
[Tom] Okay, one second.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.083
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:31.166 --> 24:32.208
Move.

24:36.125 --> 24:37.125
Go ahead.

24:38.458 --> 24:39.625
[Malorie] Go ahead.

24:39.708 --> 24:41.916
Go get a--
Go get a blanket. Go get a blanket.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.541
There should be two lamps
on either side of the door.

24:45.625 --> 24:49.041
I'm gonna hand you a blanket and I want
you to drape it across the both of them.

24:49.125 --> 24:50.208
-[Olympia] Okay.
-Okay?

24:50.291 --> 24:52.000
I need you to block the view for me.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.583
-Cover your eyes.
-[Felix] So stupid.

24:54.166 --> 24:55.750
[Tom] Malorie, cover your eyes.

25:00.708 --> 25:01.791
[Tom] Here. Here. Okay.

25:02.625 --> 25:03.666
[Olympia] Okay.

25:03.750 --> 25:04.583
[door closes]

25:04.666 --> 25:06.333
[Tom] Let me know when you have it.

25:10.875 --> 25:11.791
Tom, is this safe?

25:11.875 --> 25:13.791
-Shut up.
-[Tom] Hold on, please!

25:14.291 --> 25:16.833
-[Olympia] Okay, it's all covered.
-[Tom] Okay.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.791
-I got you. Come on.
-[door opens]

25:18.875 --> 25:19.875
Hold on. Hold on.

25:20.541 --> 25:21.750
[Olympia panting]

25:21.833 --> 25:23.291
-[Tom] We're good.
-[door closes]

25:23.375 --> 25:24.250
[lock clicks]

25:24.958 --> 25:26.625
-Malorie.
-[Malorie] Yeah.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.250
-The gun, please.
-Yeah.

25:28.333 --> 25:31.833
Yeah, before you kill someone with it
since you have no idea how it works.

25:36.791 --> 25:38.333
-[panting]
-[Greg] It's okay.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.583
How...

25:45.125 --> 25:46.541
There are so many of you.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.208
So are you, um...

25:49.458 --> 25:50.833
Are-- Are you pregnant?

25:51.958 --> 25:54.083
Yeah. October 1st.

25:55.875 --> 25:56.791
What about you?

25:59.500 --> 26:01.583
Uh, end of, uh, September.

26:01.666 --> 26:04.416
[Felix] Wait. Hold on. Is shit
still going crazy out there or what?

26:05.083 --> 26:06.750
[Cheryl] Are you on your own?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.333
Yeah, I am.

26:08.416 --> 26:11.833
My husband was deployed last month
'cause he's in the Air Force.

26:11.916 --> 26:14.541
I tried to make stuff last
as long as I could, um...

26:15.166 --> 26:18.458
but I was so hungry
and I was afraid I would starve my baby,

26:18.541 --> 26:19.875
so I didn't know what to do.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.416
-[Tom] Have some water.
-Thank you.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.000
So you left and started knocking
on random doors?

26:24.083 --> 26:25.708
[Olympia] I only live a block away.

26:25.791 --> 26:29.000
Great, now we can all starve
here in the maternity ward.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.500
It just means we need
to get more supplies.

26:32.583 --> 26:34.958
Of course, but we can't get anything
if we can't see.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.708
Oh, we're so fucking trapped.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.291
Maybe not.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.375
Maybe we can see better than we thought.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.416
-[Malorie] What do you mean?
-[Greg] Come here.

26:48.208 --> 26:51.083
We have cameras around the house
transmitting a live feed.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.250
Come upstairs. Come on.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.791
[Greg] It's a digitized signal.

26:59.875 --> 27:03.458
It just shows the color temperatures
of the objects. It's neutered information.

27:03.541 --> 27:06.208
-Colors on a flat screen.
-But an image can still have power.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.250
We have no idea
how these things can operate.

27:08.333 --> 27:09.875
These images are not direct.

27:10.916 --> 27:13.083
We can't look at whatever it is
with the naked eye,

27:13.166 --> 27:15.291
but maybe we can with a translator.

27:16.291 --> 27:17.166
Pixels and heat.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.375
Maybe it won't even show up.

27:18.458 --> 27:22.458
Well, we're not gonna find out
until one of us takes a look.

27:23.583 --> 27:25.208
I think it's a huge mistake.

27:25.291 --> 27:28.083
You would, Douglas.
You think everything is a huge mistake.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.625
Sooner or later
we're gonna have to do something.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.833
We don't know how long
we're gonna have electricity.

27:32.916 --> 27:35.708
You gotta trust me on this.
I really think this is gonna work.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.041
Okay. Okay.

27:38.125 --> 27:41.166
Maybe if it does, we could use
the technology for supply runs or---

27:41.250 --> 27:42.166
[Greg] Exactly.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.833
[Greg] Just not too tight.

27:43.916 --> 27:45.625
I hope you know what you're doing.

27:45.708 --> 27:51.416
Listen... you and your husband,
you're good people.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.875
You know, it wasn't... It wasn't that.

27:55.791 --> 27:57.125
Thank you, Douglas.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.291
[grunts]

27:59.875 --> 28:01.291
You don't have to do this.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.791
I know. Don't worry.

28:05.958 --> 28:08.583
-Tom, I need the remote.
-Yeah.

28:08.666 --> 28:09.833
There you go, bud.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
[computer beeps]

28:40.333 --> 28:41.583
So why are you suing him?

28:41.666 --> 28:43.708
'Cause they want to tear down
this part of their house

28:43.791 --> 28:46.000
and build some glass monstrosity.

28:46.083 --> 28:47.750
His husband's an architect.

28:47.833 --> 28:51.333
It's his property.
Why do you care what he builds?

28:52.625 --> 28:54.333
Because I have to look at it.

29:17.208 --> 29:18.458
[exhales]

29:20.583 --> 29:21.583
[Felix sniffles]

29:23.500 --> 29:25.000
Not a chance.

29:27.083 --> 29:30.250
Well, the world's ending, baby,
so you never know.

29:31.375 --> 29:33.583
-[scoffs]
-Hmm.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.458
[Greg] Where are you, motherfucker?

30:08.000 --> 30:09.250
[sighs]

30:16.000 --> 30:17.041
[inhales]

30:17.125 --> 30:18.250
Come on, Greg.

30:20.458 --> 30:21.333
Focus.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.375
It's, uh...
It's about the end of the world.

30:38.291 --> 30:39.375
My novel.

30:40.250 --> 30:43.583
But it's not one of those kids' stories
where they all got crossbows

30:43.666 --> 30:46.958
and they're killing each other to survive
or running around some giant maze.

30:47.041 --> 30:49.583
-[Malorie] Mm-hmm.
-No, this story is, um...

30:50.541 --> 30:51.750
This story's gonna be real.

30:52.333 --> 30:55.041
Did you ever think
it was gonna be anything like this?

31:02.083 --> 31:04.083
[rumble]

31:07.208 --> 31:09.291
[distorted whispering]

31:12.666 --> 31:14.250
[thudding]

31:16.958 --> 31:18.416
[thudding]

31:19.791 --> 31:21.916
[louder thudding]

31:23.958 --> 31:25.375
Greg! Greg, can we come in?

31:25.458 --> 31:26.875
-What's going on?
-Greg!

31:26.958 --> 31:28.625
[Malorie] Greg, can we come in?

31:30.083 --> 31:31.416
[Tom] Look away!

31:32.416 --> 31:34.708
Cover your eyes!
Cover your eyes. Find the monitor.

31:34.791 --> 31:36.291
-[Malorie] Greg.
-[Tom] Greg.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.750
-Come on, Greg.
-[Tom] Greg?

31:38.833 --> 31:41.041
-Shit.
-[Lucy] I've got it here.

31:43.083 --> 31:46.541
[Tom] Okay! Okay! Okay!
You can open your eyes. You can see.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.625
[Lucy panting]

31:52.125 --> 31:53.208
[sobs]

31:56.416 --> 31:58.625
I fucking told him that it was a mistake.

31:59.333 --> 32:02.333
[Tom] Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

32:02.416 --> 32:06.791
-[weeping] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Come on. We gotta go.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.291
We're never getting out of here.

32:09.916 --> 32:11.916
[sobs] No one's coming for us.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.875
No one's coming for-- [gasps]

32:13.958 --> 32:15.916
-[sobs]
-We need to go.

32:20.791 --> 32:22.791
[wind blowing]

32:45.666 --> 32:47.708
[sighs]

32:50.625 --> 32:51.500
Hi.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.000
Hi.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.291
Yeah.

32:54.375 --> 32:57.333
I thought it might be good for us
to be close considering...

32:59.250 --> 33:00.125
Sure.

33:02.916 --> 33:05.208
[Olympia] You know,
this way, we won't be lonely.

33:05.291 --> 33:08.125
I read this blog post once
about how pregnant women

33:08.208 --> 33:10.000
should always sleep next to someone

33:10.083 --> 33:12.750
because the baby can sense
when the mother is lonely.

33:13.375 --> 33:14.458
Perfect.

33:16.041 --> 33:19.375
So, um...
have you thought about names yet?

33:20.541 --> 33:22.083
No, not yet.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.333
How about you?

33:25.458 --> 33:30.041
Well, if it's a girl we wanted
to name her, like, Ariel or Jasmine.

33:30.125 --> 33:34.333
I mean, I would love to name her
Cinderella and just call her Ella.

33:36.875 --> 33:39.500
And what did your husband like?

33:39.583 --> 33:41.291
He loves everything I love.

33:43.958 --> 33:46.500
What about you?
Does your husband have a favorite?

33:47.333 --> 33:48.541
Oh, it's just me.

33:49.458 --> 33:52.125
-Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine. It's fine.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.916
Well, what about your family?
They must be excited--

33:55.000 --> 33:58.500
Do you know what?
Could you just excuse me for one second?

33:58.583 --> 33:59.625
I'll be right back.

34:04.833 --> 34:05.666
[sighs]

34:14.500 --> 34:16.083
[wind whistling]

34:16.166 --> 34:17.875
[rumbling]

34:17.958 --> 34:19.958
[distorted whispering]

34:27.458 --> 34:28.708
[creaking]

34:42.375 --> 34:44.375
[rumbling]

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Sorry.

34:58.125 --> 35:00.458
That's something you can't unsee.

35:01.791 --> 35:04.000
Ah, no. No, you cannot.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.083
Yeah.

35:08.250 --> 35:09.333
-[both chuckle]
-Sorry.

35:09.416 --> 35:10.291
Shh.

35:11.791 --> 35:13.583
-Shh, shh.
-Hmm.

35:19.208 --> 35:20.625
[whispering] Are you okay?

35:22.041 --> 35:23.166
Yeah.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.375
I'll wait to do my laundry in the morning.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.583
-That's probably a good idea.
-Yeah, I think so.

35:29.666 --> 35:30.791
Good night.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.666
[Malorie grunts]

36:02.583 --> 36:03.791
[Malorie grunts]

36:03.875 --> 36:05.291
[man] Hello!

36:06.708 --> 36:08.250
You guys need some help?

36:10.583 --> 36:14.250
-It's okay to take your blindfolds off.
-Do not take your blindfolds off. Do not!

36:15.458 --> 36:18.708
[man] I got some food.
Those kids look hungry.

36:18.791 --> 36:21.208
Get down! Get down! Get down!
Down. Down. Down.

36:29.791 --> 36:32.291
[man] Hey, little buddies.

36:33.083 --> 36:35.125
Have you ever seen a baby deer?

36:36.250 --> 36:37.708
I'll tell you a secret.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.208
I found one in the woods.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.083
Okay. I know you're scared.
Well, listen, there's no need.

36:56.375 --> 36:58.291
I'm not here to hurt you.
I can pull you to shore.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.500
[gunshots]

37:04.125 --> 37:06.458
[panting]

37:08.416 --> 37:10.875
-Take your goddamn blindfold off!
-[grunting]

37:11.458 --> 37:12.958
[man grunts]

37:13.041 --> 37:14.166
Ah!

37:14.250 --> 37:15.208
[Malorie grunts]

[birds squawking]

37:20.208 --> 37:22.416
[man grunting]

37:23.958 --> 37:26.666
I've seen one. I've seen the truth.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.708
[Malorie grunting]

37:27.791 --> 37:29.833
Take your blindfold off.

37:29.916 --> 37:31.458
-[man laughing]
-[birds squawking]

37:31.541 --> 37:35.041
[man] It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Take your blindfold off.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.833
[distorted growl]

37:36.916 --> 37:38.708
[grunting]

37:39.583 --> 37:41.541
[man] Take your blindfold off!

37:42.666 --> 37:44.166
[man screams]

37:44.250 --> 37:45.666
[Malorie grunting]

37:54.208 --> 37:57.333
[man] It shall cleanse the world!

37:57.416 --> 37:58.625
Everyone must look.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.208
Everyone must look.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.000
[Tom] Got some bad news.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.458
All right. We're running out of food
and there's no help coming.

38:17.541 --> 38:19.208
We've got to get outside.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.458
Look, I might know where we can get more.

38:25.458 --> 38:27.458
-Where, Charlie?
-The Fields market.

38:28.708 --> 38:31.125
I locked the place up
when everything started going crazy.

38:31.208 --> 38:34.666
-You're just telling us this?
-At least we know now. Thank you.

38:34.750 --> 38:37.250
Okay, so we'll need a group of us to go.

38:37.333 --> 38:39.125
Whoa. We'll be dead before we get there.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.833
-Are you kidding me?
-I'll go.

38:40.916 --> 38:43.166
-Well, if he's going, I'm going.
-You're pregnant!

38:43.250 --> 38:46.750
Well, if all you guys are going,
then I can come too.

38:46.833 --> 38:51.250
Why don't I go on the first run
and then you can go on the second run?

38:51.333 --> 38:52.625
-I'll come.
-[Felix] What?

38:52.708 --> 38:54.958
-It's a death wish.
-I have the training. It'll be fine.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.875
I don't like this.
I don't think anyone should go.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.375
-[Douglas] There are four of us.
-[Tom] Five. Charlie's going.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.750
Charlie's going?
Charlie ain't going nowhere.

39:02.833 --> 39:05.208
-You know the security system.
-No chance I'm going.

39:05.291 --> 39:07.208
I gave you the information.
That's all you needed.

39:07.291 --> 39:09.833
You don't need me to tell you
where to go. It is a supermarket.

39:09.916 --> 39:12.000
They got signs.
You've been shopping before.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.000
You wanna get cereal,
the sign will say cereals.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.958
If you can't read, I get it,
but you can read.

39:16.625 --> 39:20.791
-No. You don't need me to go with you--
-Charlie. It'll be research for the book.

39:20.875 --> 39:22.833
Okay? Be awesome.

39:26.791 --> 39:29.625
All right, so the idea is if we
can black out all the windows,

39:30.250 --> 39:32.250
it's efficient and it's safe.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.875
Is anybody else hearing this?

39:34.500 --> 39:36.083
How is driving blind safer?

39:36.166 --> 39:37.083
We're not.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.458
We've got the GPS.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.041
[engine starts]

40:04.041 --> 40:06.291
-[GPS beeps]

40:29.333 --> 40:31.500
-[GPS beeps]
-[female voice] Continue straight.

40:35.791 --> 40:38.625
In half a mile,
turn right onto Bay Street.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.500
-What is that?
-It's a curb.

40:41.583 --> 40:42.791
It's just a curb.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.583
[panting]

40:45.666 --> 40:47.458
[beeping]

40:48.125 --> 40:50.041
It's a proximity sensor.

41:02.833 --> 41:05.000
Just a speed bump. It's just a speed bump.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.875
[female voice] Turn right here.

41:12.208 --> 41:13.833
[beeping]

41:13.916 --> 41:14.833
[beeping faster]

41:21.625 --> 41:23.125
[beeping]

41:26.458 --> 41:28.708
[beeping faster]

41:28.791 --> 41:30.750
-Are we off the road?
-No, there's something.

41:31.333 --> 41:34.208
-I think it must be just a truck.
-Just go around.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.250
-Keep going around it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.666
[rumbling]

41:38.750 --> 41:39.958
What was that?

41:40.041 --> 41:41.041
[panting]

41:44.416 --> 41:46.375
[beeping]

41:46.958 --> 41:48.125
[beeping faster]

41:48.208 --> 41:50.291
[one continuous beep]

41:50.375 --> 41:52.041
Is somebody else driving out there?

41:55.125 --> 41:57.166
[rumbling]

42:03.708 --> 42:06.208
-[Malorie] Charlie, breathe.
-Shit! Fuck this shit.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.208
-Get the fuck out!
-Charlie! Calm down.

42:08.291 --> 42:10.291
Guys, stop touching him.

42:10.375 --> 42:12.916
-Look at me. You have to be quiet.
-Shut him up.

42:14.416 --> 42:16.166
[rumbling]

42:17.958 --> 42:19.750
[beeping]

42:21.666 --> 42:23.583
[distorted whispering]

42:23.666 --> 42:25.458
[Charlie] Ah. Ah!

42:25.541 --> 42:26.916
Fuck! We're not gonna make it.

42:28.958 --> 42:31.041
-[Charlie screams]
-Calm down. Calm down.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.333
-[Lucy] Oh, shit!
-Everybody, hold on.

42:34.416 --> 42:36.458
Hold on to something. Gonna move!

42:36.541 --> 42:37.916
-[tires screech]
-Ah!

42:38.833 --> 42:39.958
Hold on!

42:40.041 --> 42:41.500
That's not a fucking speed bump!

42:41.583 --> 42:43.541
-Fuck, it's stuck.
-Hold on.

42:44.541 --> 42:47.333
-[female voice] Turn left here.
-Slow down! Slow down!

42:47.416 --> 42:48.708
[tires squeal]

42:51.333 --> 42:52.500
[tires screech]

42:54.208 --> 42:55.708
[female voice] You have arrived.

42:57.833 --> 42:59.250
[Charlie] What the fuck?

42:59.333 --> 43:01.791
And after all this,
we're supposed to get out now?

43:02.583 --> 43:03.541
Lucky us.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.916
-[Tom] On three. One...
-[Charlie] I'm ready now.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.333
...two, three.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.375
[Malorie] What was that?
What did I just hit?

43:15.458 --> 43:16.875
[Charlie] That's just a pillar.

43:19.583 --> 43:20.916
[Douglas] Okay. Where's the--

43:21.000 --> 43:23.833
[Charlie] The door should be
just a couple of paces up, man.

43:23.916 --> 43:25.666
-[Tom] I'm lost.
-[Charlie] Towards your left.

43:25.750 --> 43:28.291
[Tom] Left. Left. I'm lost.

43:28.375 --> 43:30.541
-[Douglas] Come on, you guys.
-I'm lost.

43:30.625 --> 43:33.000
-Oh, here. Here.
-[Lucy] Okay. Okay.

43:33.083 --> 43:34.250
-You're in?
-No.

43:34.333 --> 43:35.708
Okay. Wait. Almost got it.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.166
Okay, I got it.

43:39.208 --> 43:40.125
Go on.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.541
All right. We're in.

43:50.666 --> 43:52.625
-Hello!
-Shh! Shh!

43:54.333 --> 43:55.500
I'll check the windows.

43:56.250 --> 43:57.958
Here we go. Here we go.

44:08.041 --> 44:10.833
[Tom] All right, I think we're clear.
You can take 'em off.

44:15.375 --> 44:16.875
Oh, my God.

44:17.458 --> 44:19.666
-Jack-fucking-pot.
-Yeah.

44:21.041 --> 44:22.750
-Where are the canned goods?
-Aisle two.

44:22.833 --> 44:24.166
-Toilet paper?
-Five.

44:24.250 --> 44:26.666
-Fuck that. Where's the booze?
-It's in seven.

44:26.750 --> 44:30.750
Let's not forget. We have limited space.
Stick to non-perishables, the necessities.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.625
-Where are the electronics?
-Go to six.

44:32.708 --> 44:34.458
[Tom] Six. All right. Cool. Thank you.

44:35.041 --> 44:36.541
I'm not cleaning this shit up.

44:39.375 --> 44:40.500
Sweet.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.291
Boy, I'm glad I tagged along.

44:49.875 --> 44:53.166
This is truly the happiest place on Earth.

44:53.250 --> 44:55.333
I know. You're not kidding!

45:00.791 --> 45:04.958
It's, uh... my baby shower gift to you.

45:06.708 --> 45:07.708
Why, thank you.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.000
[Tom] Yeah.

45:09.083 --> 45:12.208
So, my sister is
expecting her fourth, so...

45:12.708 --> 45:15.250
Oh, my God. She's a saint.

45:15.333 --> 45:16.541
Yeah, she is.

45:17.583 --> 45:19.708
And I'm always touching her belly.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.000
It's calming.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.750
Yeah, it's nature's dirty little trick.

45:28.958 --> 45:30.458
Is your sister in Sacramento?

45:32.500 --> 45:33.625
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

45:33.708 --> 45:34.666
Yeah.

45:38.583 --> 45:39.833
[grunts]

45:39.916 --> 45:42.750
What about you? Where did you--
Where did you grow up?

45:42.833 --> 45:44.333
Oh, just outside of Stockton.

45:44.416 --> 45:45.916
-Stockton.
-Yeah.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.041
-We raised horses.
-On a real ranch?

45:48.625 --> 45:52.500
-Well, my daddy was a real cowboy.
-That's--That's how you learned your...

45:52.583 --> 45:54.041
-What?
-...little shotgun trick.

45:54.125 --> 45:56.375
Yeah. I had an interesting childhood.

45:56.458 --> 45:57.333
Hmm.

45:58.041 --> 46:01.416
Ah, but Stockton wasn't
all that far from Sacramento.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.750
No. Just down 99.

46:03.833 --> 46:06.208
-Just down Highway 99.
-Worlds apart, right?

46:07.666 --> 46:10.125
Still we could've met some other way.

46:11.375 --> 46:12.333
Sure.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.125
Could have been your babysitter.

46:17.416 --> 46:19.041
My hot babysitter.

46:22.208 --> 46:26.041
You're... You're only saying that
'cause we're all gonna die.

46:27.791 --> 46:28.666
Possibly.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.625
[birds chirping]

47:05.750 --> 47:08.083
[whispers] How did you guys get so lucky?

47:09.458 --> 47:10.500
Huh?

47:12.041 --> 47:13.041
Hi.

47:15.208 --> 47:16.375
Hi, there.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.458
So sleepy.

47:23.125 --> 47:27.500
[Douglas] Attention, all shoppers,
come to aisle seven, please.

47:27.583 --> 47:31.541
I have a big, big, big, big, big
announcement to make.

47:31.625 --> 47:34.541
-Ladies and gentlemen, please...
-Yes, Douglas.

47:35.125 --> 47:40.833
I would like to take this opportunity
to make a toast to all of us...

47:41.416 --> 47:48.250
because all of us, collectively,
are making the end of the world...

47:51.666 --> 47:55.041
great again! Yeah!

47:58.083 --> 47:59.625
[birds chirping]

47:59.708 --> 48:00.583
Birdies.

48:02.500 --> 48:05.875
I mean, don't you doofuses get it?

48:06.583 --> 48:08.958
Uh, we could just stay here.

48:09.041 --> 48:14.250
We have a year's supply
of food and drink right here.

48:14.333 --> 48:17.666
We don't ever have to pay
and we shouldn't ever leave.

48:17.750 --> 48:19.958
And what are they gonna
do at Greg's? Starve?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.333
Better them than us. [laughs]

48:24.416 --> 48:27.708
We have everything we need to live here.
Everything.

48:27.791 --> 48:34.083
There is no statistical, logical, or legal
argument for trying to get back there.

48:34.166 --> 48:37.291
Here's an argument: we're not assholes.

48:39.541 --> 48:40.833
And we're not staying.

48:40.916 --> 48:42.458
[knock at door]

48:46.291 --> 48:47.833
[knock at door]

48:50.083 --> 48:51.000
What is it?

48:51.083 --> 48:52.958
[knocking]

48:55.958 --> 48:59.166
-[man] Somebody let me out of here.
-Charlie, what's behind there?

48:59.250 --> 49:00.416
It's a loading dock.

49:01.041 --> 49:02.000
[Tom] Hello?

49:02.958 --> 49:05.250
[man sobbing] Please let me in.

49:06.416 --> 49:07.916
[Tom] Speak up, I can't hear you.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.875
Please let me in.

49:11.625 --> 49:12.625
Cover your eyes.

49:12.708 --> 49:14.333
-[Malorie] What?
-I'm gonna open the door.

49:14.416 --> 49:16.541
-[Malorie] No.
-There's a person out there.

49:16.625 --> 49:18.250
I have to open the door.

49:20.666 --> 49:23.083
[Tom] Okay.

49:23.166 --> 49:24.291
Okay. Uh...

49:24.958 --> 49:25.958
Okay.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.875
-Hello?
-Hello.

49:31.500 --> 49:33.791
[man] Please let me in. I'm trapped.

49:33.875 --> 49:36.625
Wait, wait, wait. Is that...
Fish Fingers, is that you?

49:36.708 --> 49:39.958
-Charlie, yeah, it's me.
-[Malorie] Who's Fish Fingers, Charlie?

49:40.041 --> 49:43.000
He works here at the supermarket with me.
He works in the seafood department.

49:43.083 --> 49:46.458
He's been to prison and he's a bit crazy,
but he's always nice to me.

49:46.541 --> 49:48.833
-How did you get there, man?
-I got... I got...

49:48.916 --> 49:50.583
[stutters] They tricked me!

49:50.666 --> 49:51.625
Who's they?

49:51.708 --> 49:53.708
Who you talking about?
Are you there alone?

49:53.791 --> 49:55.750
They tricked me
and they left me to rot here.

49:55.833 --> 49:57.875
Who left you to rot?
What are you talking about?

49:57.958 --> 50:00.000
[Malorie] You guys,
there's something wrong.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.375
There's something wrong!

50:01.458 --> 50:04.375
-Please let me in. I'm trapped.
-Hey. Hey. Hey.

50:04.458 --> 50:06.750
What are you doin', Fish Fingers?
What are you doing, man?

50:07.750 --> 50:10.916
[Fish Fingers] Look at it!
It wants you to see it! Let me in!

50:12.291 --> 50:14.041
[shouting]

50:14.125 --> 50:17.083
[Lucy] He's too strong. I can't hold him.

50:17.166 --> 50:18.500
[Fish Fingers] Let me in!

50:18.583 --> 50:19.916
[Tom] Shit!

50:20.000 --> 50:21.875
[Fish Fingers grunting]

50:21.958 --> 50:23.625
[Malorie] Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

50:23.708 --> 50:25.000
Fuck! Ah!

50:25.083 --> 50:26.416
[Malorie] Charlie, wait!

50:29.625 --> 50:32.083
[Fish Fingers]
Look at it, Charlie. It's beautiful.

50:32.166 --> 50:34.000
-Charlie?
-Charlie!

50:34.916 --> 50:35.916
[slashing sound]

50:36.000 --> 50:37.791
-Charlie!
-[Douglas] Charlie!

50:37.875 --> 50:39.791
-Oh, shit.
-[Lucy] Oh, fuck.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.875
[Lucy screaming]

50:43.041 --> 50:44.041
Fuck!

50:45.750 --> 50:47.083
[panting]

50:47.166 --> 50:48.291
[Tom] We gotta go.

50:49.833 --> 50:51.666
We gotta move. Come on. Let's go.

50:51.750 --> 50:52.958
Let's get out of here.

50:54.583 --> 50:56.333
[pounding on door]

50:56.958 --> 50:59.958
[Fish Fingers] Please. Please let me in.

51:00.041 --> 51:02.041
[Douglas] How is that guy alive in there?

51:02.625 --> 51:04.333
[Fish fingers] Please let me in.

51:04.833 --> 51:06.666
[pounding on door]

51:27.958 --> 51:29.583
Hi, Felix!

51:30.750 --> 51:33.166
Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.083
-Birdies?
-[Malorie] Yeah, they, uh...

51:36.166 --> 51:38.666
They seem to sense
when the creatures are around.

51:39.250 --> 51:40.625
Where's Charlie?

51:42.583 --> 51:45.291
Another novel I won't have to read.

51:45.375 --> 51:47.791
He saved us, you fucking asshole.

52:09.458 --> 52:12.208
[Douglas] I know what you think of me,
what everybody thinks of me.

52:12.291 --> 52:14.208
You know, in the divorce petition...

52:15.166 --> 52:20.625
my first wife said that to call me a creep
would be an affront to creeps everywhere.

52:20.708 --> 52:22.208
[liquor pouring]

52:22.291 --> 52:25.291
My second wife said
she no longer feared going to hell,

52:25.375 --> 52:28.416
'cause it couldn't possibly be worse
than being married to me.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.583
Think I would have loved them.

52:30.666 --> 52:31.541
[Douglas] Maybe.

52:32.125 --> 52:33.208
And then Lydia.

52:34.166 --> 52:37.083
Third time really was the charm for me.

52:38.625 --> 52:40.875
She was the kindest person I ever met.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.375
But I'm here and she's gone.
You know why that is?

52:44.458 --> 52:47.041
Because, in the end,
there are only two types of people.

52:47.125 --> 52:49.125
The assholes and the dead.

52:49.208 --> 52:51.416
[Malorie] God, you sound like my father.

52:52.083 --> 52:53.250
Like your father? Why?

52:53.333 --> 52:58.583
Was he a towering intellect given
to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools?

52:58.666 --> 53:00.500
Yes, he was fluent in asshole as well.

53:01.541 --> 53:06.458
And just like you, he blamed
everything he did on some deeper meaning,

53:07.041 --> 53:09.125
convoluted conspiracy theories and...

53:10.375 --> 53:13.041
how it was everybody else's fault
when he was clearly in the wrong.

53:13.125 --> 53:16.458
But, you know, once my sister and I
realized it was just an excuse

53:16.541 --> 53:20.250
to treat his family like shit,
it made life a little easier.

53:20.333 --> 53:23.291
You know what though?
I see one difference between us.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.458
Hmm?

53:25.541 --> 53:26.583
I'm never wrong.

53:27.166 --> 53:28.291
You are...

53:28.375 --> 53:29.791
You're two pricks in a pod.

53:30.791 --> 53:32.333
Do I look like him as well?

53:33.166 --> 53:34.125
Mm...

53:35.166 --> 53:36.166
Not really.

53:37.166 --> 53:40.458
-He wasn't exquisitely handsome?
-It's not that, it's just...

53:42.375 --> 53:44.458
the hair... the hair is different.

53:44.541 --> 53:45.916
-The hair?
-Yeah.

53:46.958 --> 53:48.041
He had some.

53:48.625 --> 53:49.458
Oh.

53:58.375 --> 54:00.041
Oh, I can't.

54:00.125 --> 54:02.875
Oh, come on, the world is ending.

54:02.958 --> 54:06.875
I really don't think a quarter-ounce
of whiskey's gonna tip the scales, do you?

54:08.708 --> 54:09.541
[grunts]

54:10.375 --> 54:11.291
Well...

54:12.416 --> 54:13.833
I hope you're wrong.

54:14.916 --> 54:16.708
About the assholes and the dead.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.375
I hope there is more.

54:22.125 --> 54:24.375
Here's to hoping there is more.

54:39.083 --> 54:40.500
[car engine starts]

54:47.458 --> 54:49.208
-[Tom] Close the garage.
-I've got it.

54:50.666 --> 54:52.083
-[Tom] Wait. Wait. Wait.
-[beep]

54:52.166 --> 54:53.791
-Cover your eyes.
-[Douglas] Yeah.

54:53.875 --> 54:56.541
[Malorie] Okay, okay, okay.
It's closed. It's closed.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.458
[Douglas] Sons of bitches.

55:00.458 --> 55:02.250
Where's the goddamn car?

55:02.333 --> 55:04.458
You guys.
You guys, where are Lucy and Felix?

55:09.208 --> 55:10.250
[Malorie moans]

55:13.333 --> 55:14.375
Fuck.

55:17.791 --> 55:19.125
[sighs]

55:34.125 --> 55:35.791
[panting]

55:43.416 --> 55:44.583
You stopped rowing.

55:45.458 --> 55:46.791
I'm just taking a break.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.583
How much longer?

55:49.666 --> 55:50.708
A few hours.

56:10.833 --> 56:11.958
[Boy] Ah!

56:15.500 --> 56:16.875
[Boy] Malorie!

56:17.916 --> 56:20.333
Malorie! Malorie!

56:20.416 --> 56:21.541
Help!

56:23.041 --> 56:23.875
Malorie!

56:27.208 --> 56:28.500
[grunts]

56:28.583 --> 56:29.541
[panting]

56:29.625 --> 56:31.791
-Are you okay? Are you okay?
-Yes.

56:31.875 --> 56:34.333
-I'm cold.
-I know. I know you're cold. Hold on.

56:37.750 --> 56:42.291
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All the food and blankets. God damn it!

56:42.375 --> 56:43.208
[grunts]

56:43.291 --> 56:45.125
-I'm sorry.
-[Malorie] No, no, it's...

56:45.208 --> 56:46.166
Hold on.

56:46.791 --> 56:48.791
Okay. All right.

56:48.875 --> 56:51.333
-Okay.
-[coughs] I'm so cold.

56:51.916 --> 56:55.083
We're gonna get you warmed up, okay?
We're gonna get you warmed up.

56:56.833 --> 56:59.000
Put this around you.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.041
Keep your blindfolds on. Stay tight.

57:02.625 --> 57:04.083
[wind chimes clanking]

57:05.083 --> 57:06.583
Did you hear that?

57:06.666 --> 57:07.666
Did you hear that?

57:08.458 --> 57:10.291
[grunting]

57:18.500 --> 57:21.041
Lay down on the bottom of the boat.
Lay down, really flat.

57:21.125 --> 57:23.541
I need you to be quiet.
I'm gonna leave the birds with you.

57:23.625 --> 57:26.541
I'm gonna cover you up, but do not
make a sound and do not leave this boat.

57:26.625 --> 57:28.083
Understand? Do not leave this boat!

57:29.416 --> 57:31.416
[panting]

59:00.500 --> 59:01.625
Shit.

59:38.041 --> 59:39.166
[metal clang]

59:42.500 --> 59:44.541
[metal clanging]

1:00:11.041 --> 1:00:12.875

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:15.416
[rumbling]

1:00:43.750 --> 1:00:45.125
[rumbling]

1:00:49.708 --> 1:00:51.416
[distorted whispering] Malorie.

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:53.250
Malorie.

1:00:53.333 --> 1:00:54.333
[grunts]

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:57.666
Malorie.

1:01:05.625 --> 1:01:06.958
[gunshots]

1:01:07.041 --> 1:01:09.833
Something is wrong with Malorie.

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:12.166
[distorted whispering] Malorie.

1:01:12.250 --> 1:01:13.333
Ah! Ah!

1:01:13.416 --> 1:01:15.583
[rumbling]

1:01:25.416 --> 1:01:27.541
[panting]

1:01:29.333 --> 1:01:31.541
[distorted whispering]

1:01:46.791 --> 1:01:47.833
Malorie?

1:01:53.541 --> 1:01:54.583
Malorie?

1:01:58.541 --> 1:02:00.291
-[distorted whispers]
-Malorie?

1:02:06.875 --> 1:02:07.875
[Malorie grunts]

1:02:07.958 --> 1:02:09.916
I told you to stay on the boat.

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.041
You don't think.

1:02:11.125 --> 1:02:13.500
You do exactly what I say or you die,
do you understand me?

1:02:13.583 --> 1:02:16.250
If something happens to me,
do not try and help me.

1:02:16.333 --> 1:02:18.166
Forget about me and try to save yourself.

1:02:18.250 --> 1:02:19.625
Do you understand?

1:02:19.708 --> 1:02:22.833
Say it! If something happens to me,
what do you do?

1:02:22.916 --> 1:02:25.291
You save yourself. Say it!

1:02:25.916 --> 1:02:27.916
-I save myself.
-You save yourself.

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:31.083
[Malorie] I can't trust you.

1:02:49.583 --> 1:02:52.833
[Malorie]
The end of the world makes us do things.

1:02:54.166 --> 1:02:56.833
-[Tom] It's not the end of the world.
-[Malorie] Really?

1:02:57.541 --> 1:02:58.791
It sure feels like it.

1:03:02.541 --> 1:03:08.250
At the end of my deployment in Iraq,
we were stationed at this village...

1:03:10.541 --> 1:03:13.500
ordered to patrol the streets,
make sure everybody was safe.

1:03:15.833 --> 1:03:16.958
One morning, we saw...

1:03:18.416 --> 1:03:21.000
this father walking with his four kids.

1:03:21.083 --> 1:03:23.458
So I pulled over to make sure
everything was okay

1:03:23.541 --> 1:03:26.166
and to make sure he got
wherever he was going safely.

1:03:29.166 --> 1:03:31.333
Come to find out,
he was walking his kids to school.

1:03:33.583 --> 1:03:36.166
In the middle of all that shit,

1:03:36.750 --> 1:03:39.250
all that chaos,
he was walking his kids to school.

1:03:46.333 --> 1:03:47.208
So...

1:03:50.791 --> 1:03:52.208
So we just followed him.

1:03:53.750 --> 1:03:54.833
Day after day.

1:03:55.458 --> 1:03:56.500
We escorted him.

1:03:59.958 --> 1:04:01.416
That just became our routine.

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.500
And then, at the end of our time,

1:04:06.583 --> 1:04:10.250
he gave me this
when it was time to come back home.

1:04:16.750 --> 1:04:17.625
Mm.

1:04:23.833 --> 1:04:26.500
I like to think he's still
walking his kids to school.

1:05:06.166 --> 1:05:07.208
[beep]

1:05:07.291 --> 1:05:09.458
[Malorie]
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

1:05:09.541 --> 1:05:12.125
This is Malorie.
Anybody, can you hear me? Hello?

1:05:12.208 --> 1:05:13.541
[static]

1:05:15.250 --> 1:05:18.583
Can anybody hear me? Hello?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:22.833
Hello? Testing, hello?

1:05:24.041 --> 1:05:25.125
[static]

1:05:25.208 --> 1:05:27.166
Hello, is anyone out there? Hello?

1:05:28.041 --> 1:05:30.125
[Olympia] Can you hear me, please?

1:05:30.208 --> 1:05:32.208
-Hello? Testing.
-[Olympia] Are you a...

1:05:32.291 --> 1:05:33.708
Do you have a blindfold on?

1:05:34.375 --> 1:05:37.625
You do.
Is-- Is the blanket behind you still up?

1:05:37.708 --> 1:05:39.791
[sighs] Ah...

1:05:39.875 --> 1:05:42.250
Okay, just come in really, really quickly.

1:05:42.333 --> 1:05:45.791
Thank you. Here's my blindfold.
Thank you so much.

1:05:45.875 --> 1:05:49.375
It's okay. Just wait. Wait here. Malorie!

1:05:49.458 --> 1:05:51.208
-I gotta pee.
-Olympia, what are you doing?

1:05:51.291 --> 1:05:52.541
-Malorie!
-What are you doing?

1:05:52.625 --> 1:05:56.416
-What are you thinking? Get down!
-[Olympia] Okay, he's just scared.

1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:58.458
-He's just scared.
-Tom. Check the bag.

1:05:58.541 --> 1:06:01.041
-Get over here, Olympia. Get over here.
-[grunts]

1:06:01.125 --> 1:06:02.750
-Who are you?
-Who is this guy?

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:05.083
Tom, I've got him. Check the bag.
Check the bag.

1:06:05.666 --> 1:06:07.041
-Who is this?
-He's just scared.

1:06:07.125 --> 1:06:08.583
-Who are you?
-How did he get in here?

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:12.208
-Shut up, Olympia. Who are you?
-He was scared, okay? I just let him in.

1:06:12.291 --> 1:06:14.666
-You let a stranger in the house!
-I'm sorry.

1:06:14.750 --> 1:06:16.416
-He was terrified!
-Are you a simpleton?

1:06:16.958 --> 1:06:18.958
Oh, God. Okay. Please.

1:06:19.041 --> 1:06:20.416
My name is Gary.

1:06:21.291 --> 1:06:22.416
I live in the city.

1:06:22.916 --> 1:06:25.666
When these things came, I got
the first train out with some colleagues

1:06:25.750 --> 1:06:27.250
because we thought it would be safe.

1:06:29.833 --> 1:06:34.041
Please, please just let me stay here.
They're after me.

1:06:34.625 --> 1:06:35.875
Who's after you?

1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:38.583
-I don't believe it. He's lying.
-Who's after you?

1:06:38.666 --> 1:06:39.791
It's obvious he's lying.

1:06:39.875 --> 1:06:41.375
-I swear.
-Why are you here?

1:06:41.458 --> 1:06:45.416
We went
to my colleague Carl's house to lay low.

1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:49.250
Everything was fine until they broke in.

1:06:50.541 --> 1:06:52.333
Creatures don't break into people's homes.

1:06:52.416 --> 1:06:54.500
No, not the creatures, these psychos.

1:06:56.375 --> 1:06:58.333
These psychos from Northwood.

1:06:58.416 --> 1:07:00.833
[Malorie] Northwood?
I don't... Where is that?

1:07:00.916 --> 1:07:03.625
It's a mental institution
for the criminally insane.

1:07:03.708 --> 1:07:06.916
Well, it's nice to know
they have hall passes now.

1:07:07.708 --> 1:07:08.583
And then what?

1:07:08.666 --> 1:07:13.000
They took us outside
and they forced our eyes open

1:07:13.083 --> 1:07:15.458
so that we would have
to look at the creatures.

1:07:17.041 --> 1:07:18.041
[Malorie] What?

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:21.041
-Did you look?
-No.

1:07:21.125 --> 1:07:26.916
Somehow, my friend Carl managed to tackle
one of these people to the ground

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.125
and the rest of us made a run for it.

1:07:29.208 --> 1:07:32.625
I just kept on running
and running and running till I got here.

1:07:33.791 --> 1:07:37.375
I've been knocking on
all the doors and nobody answered.

1:07:38.958 --> 1:07:40.750
Until you did, so...

1:07:41.250 --> 1:07:42.250
[sobs]

1:07:42.791 --> 1:07:43.666
Thank you.

1:07:44.791 --> 1:07:45.833
[sighs]

1:07:50.583 --> 1:07:51.500
[birds chirping]

1:07:54.458 --> 1:07:55.416
Birds.

1:07:56.666 --> 1:08:01.625
The scariest thing was, uh...
when these people broke in, they...

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.833
they weren't wearing blindfolds.

1:08:07.625 --> 1:08:09.083
It's like they didn't need them.

1:08:09.166 --> 1:08:11.666
But they'd been outside.
You have to wear blindfolds.

1:08:11.750 --> 1:08:12.750
Not these people.

1:08:13.916 --> 1:08:16.833
These crazy guys
weren't affected like everyone else.

1:08:16.916 --> 1:08:18.458
They wanted to see.

1:08:19.166 --> 1:08:20.041
They were happy.

1:08:21.250 --> 1:08:23.458
They were so glad.

1:08:25.208 --> 1:08:28.500
And they said everyone needed to see.

1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:34.458
[gasps] Wait.

1:08:34.541 --> 1:08:37.333
[Douglas] Get up and get out.
It's not an orphanage.

1:08:37.416 --> 1:08:41.916
New guy, you had a great visit.
We really loved meeting you. Now fuck off.

1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:46.333
And anybody who doesn't agree,
you go with him.

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:48.583
-Out now!
-Douglas, that is murder.

1:08:48.666 --> 1:08:50.083
No. This is murder.

1:08:50.166 --> 1:08:53.041
-Please.
-Letting strangers into this house.

1:08:53.625 --> 1:08:58.583
Every contact we have had
with the outside has brought us death.

1:08:58.666 --> 1:09:00.583
Lydia, Greg, Charlie.

1:09:00.666 --> 1:09:02.583
If you wanna save people out there,

1:09:02.666 --> 1:09:05.541
then you go right through that door
and you go do it.

1:09:05.625 --> 1:09:08.375
We're not bringing
any more strangers in here.

1:09:08.958 --> 1:09:10.250
Not while I'm alive.

1:09:10.333 --> 1:09:13.166
I won't tell you again, get up and get--

1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:22.750
Thank you.

1:09:23.875 --> 1:09:25.583
[Tom] You'll sleep in the garage.

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:27.375
[Tom grunts]

1:09:35.333 --> 1:09:37.125
The only reason I opened that door

1:09:37.208 --> 1:09:39.875
is 'cause I remember
what it felt like to be outside of it.

1:09:41.083 --> 1:09:43.166
If you guys hadn't let me in, I...

1:09:44.083 --> 1:09:46.166
[chuckles] I feel like such a burden.

1:09:46.250 --> 1:09:48.791
You are no more a burden than I am, okay?

1:09:48.875 --> 1:09:50.458
-That's not true.
-It is. It is.

1:09:50.541 --> 1:09:52.041
You're not soft like me.

1:09:53.041 --> 1:09:55.583
I'm so spoiled.

1:09:56.458 --> 1:10:00.708
My parents have always done
everything for me and then my husband,

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:04.166
and I just...
I got soft from all that love.

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:08.458
Well, I was raised by wolves,
so consider yourself lucky.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:17.250
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of my baby.

1:10:18.125 --> 1:10:19.041
Okay?

1:10:19.541 --> 1:10:20.791
-No. No.
-Please.

1:10:20.875 --> 1:10:22.166
-It's your baby.
-Malorie.

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:23.500
No.

1:10:23.583 --> 1:10:25.750
-Promise me.
-Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1:10:25.833 --> 1:10:26.666
It's your baby.

1:10:26.750 --> 1:10:27.750
-Promise me.
-Nothing--

1:10:27.833 --> 1:10:29.458
Please promise me.

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:34.125
Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course.

1:10:41.750 --> 1:10:43.041
What is this?

1:10:44.083 --> 1:10:45.791
Well, if I was just gonna tell you,

1:10:45.875 --> 1:10:49.750
I wouldn't have bothered
putting it in this fancy-- this fancy bag.

1:10:54.041 --> 1:10:54.916
[Olympia laughs]

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.666

If there is anyone there, please respond.

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.625
-Hello?
-[Tom] Hello.

1:28:35.708 --> 1:28:37.125
Who is this?

1:28:37.208 --> 1:28:39.041
My name is Rick.

1:28:39.708 --> 1:28:40.625
Who is this?

1:28:43.166 --> 1:28:44.375
Rick, this is Tom.

1:28:44.458 --> 1:28:45.791
We have a place.

1:28:45.875 --> 1:28:48.416
A compound with enough supplies--

1:28:48.500 --> 1:28:49.833
[static]

1:28:49.916 --> 1:28:50.916
We have a community.

1:28:52.041 --> 1:28:53.625
It's safe here.

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:56.666
We're down by the river's end.

1:28:56.750 --> 1:28:59.041
-Where are you?
-[whispers] Don't answer that.

1:29:00.125 --> 1:29:01.541
Near Pike's Quarry.

1:29:02.125 --> 1:29:05.666
Jesus. You're a ways away.
How many of you are there?

1:29:06.583 --> 1:29:08.333
-Four of us.
-Hmm-mm.

1:29:08.416 --> 1:29:09.958
Are any of them children?

1:29:10.041 --> 1:29:12.583
-Don't, do not say anything.
-It's okay. It's okay.

1:29:13.750 --> 1:29:16.125
No. Why?

1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.625
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

1:29:19.708 --> 1:29:22.416
and I don't think
you could make it with kids.

1:29:23.125 --> 1:29:24.708
[Tom] Wait, the river?

1:29:25.291 --> 1:29:27.041
Float downstream as far as you can.

1:29:27.125 --> 1:29:29.291
Stay on the water
until you hit the rapids.

1:29:30.208 --> 1:29:32.583
The water is fast there. It's dangerous.

1:29:33.125 --> 1:29:34.416
We've lost some people.

1:29:35.291 --> 1:29:37.375
You need to see clearly.

1:29:37.458 --> 1:29:40.083
-What does that mean?
-What do you mean, see clearly?

1:29:41.250 --> 1:29:43.291
You will have to look.

1:29:44.583 --> 1:29:46.833
-I'm telling you.
-Rick, we'll have blindfolds on.

1:29:46.916 --> 1:29:48.083
We can't look.

1:29:48.166 --> 1:29:50.041
I'm glad you said that.

1:29:50.125 --> 1:29:51.833
Someone will have to take a--

1:29:51.916 --> 1:29:53.333
[static]

1:29:53.416 --> 1:29:57.500
Prepare for two days' journey
at the pace of the river's current.

1:29:57.583 --> 1:29:59.166
Bring supplies for longer.

1:29:59.750 --> 1:30:01.875
How do I find you after the rapids, Rick?

1:30:01.958 --> 1:30:03.208
You'll hear the birds.

1:30:03.875 --> 1:30:07.041
We've got a lot of them.
Just follow the sound to us.

1:30:07.125 --> 1:30:10.500
Down a small embankment,
you'll find a wall with a gate.

1:30:10.583 --> 1:30:11.458
That's our--

1:30:11.541 --> 1:30:12.416
[static]

1:30:13.875 --> 1:30:15.333
-That's their what?
-That's our what?

1:30:16.291 --> 1:30:17.166
Rick?

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:19.458
[Tom] Rick?

1:30:30.791 --> 1:30:31.750
[Tom] It could be real.

1:30:31.833 --> 1:30:32.833
-No.
-Could be the truth.

1:30:32.916 --> 1:30:35.125
-Could be is not good enough.
-What if Rick could help us?

1:30:35.208 --> 1:30:36.833
And what if Rick is one of them?

1:30:37.416 --> 1:30:38.625
Huh?

1:30:38.708 --> 1:30:40.291
Wait, he knew about the birds.

1:30:40.958 --> 1:30:43.708
Oh, my God. Gary knew about the birds
and he put them in the freezer.

1:30:43.791 --> 1:30:46.000
I cannot believe
you're actually thinking about this.

1:30:46.083 --> 1:30:47.958
Every house has run out of food.
We have to move.

1:30:48.041 --> 1:30:51.208
You really don't think I know that?
You don't think I know that?

1:30:56.750 --> 1:30:59.125
When I was little,
we had a boat just like this.

1:30:59.708 --> 1:31:01.958
And every single summer,
we would take it to the lake.

1:31:02.041 --> 1:31:03.000
Every summer.

1:31:03.583 --> 1:31:07.000
You guys would have loved it up there.
They had trees. They had flowers.

1:31:07.583 --> 1:31:10.458
The water was warm,
the clouds were in the sky.

1:31:11.291 --> 1:31:14.125
We'd all play in the water.
All the kids, all the children.

1:31:14.208 --> 1:31:16.208
We would all just run
up and down the shore.

1:31:16.291 --> 1:31:18.250
There were other children in the world?

1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.500
Yeah, just like you. Just like you.

1:31:21.583 --> 1:31:23.000
-[giggles]
-Like you.

1:31:23.833 --> 1:31:26.916
[Tom] One day, we saw
this really, really big oak tree.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.541
It was bigger than this house.

1:31:28.625 --> 1:31:31.083
It was so big and old,
I couldn't see the top of it.

1:31:31.166 --> 1:31:32.583
-Guess what we did?
-Climbed it.

1:31:32.666 --> 1:31:34.291
We climbed it. Yes, we climbed it.

1:31:34.375 --> 1:31:36.750
We climbed it and climbed it
until we got to the top.

1:31:37.708 --> 1:31:39.291
Guess what we saw when we got to the top?

1:31:39.375 --> 1:31:40.875
Boy! Girl! Time for bed.

1:31:40.958 --> 1:31:42.500
But Tom's telling a story.

1:31:42.583 --> 1:31:45.958
-Mal, let me just-- We're almost done.
-I'm not gonna say it again. Come on.

1:31:48.583 --> 1:31:49.541
Girl, come on.

1:31:50.958 --> 1:31:52.083
Right now.

1:31:52.166 --> 1:31:53.125
Come on.

1:31:53.958 --> 1:31:55.416
Right now.

1:31:56.375 --> 1:31:57.250
Bed!

1:31:59.791 --> 1:32:00.750
[door slams]

1:32:00.833 --> 1:32:02.791
-[Malorie] What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

1:32:02.875 --> 1:32:05.958
Now they think they're gonna go outside
and climb trees with all these new kids

1:32:06.041 --> 1:32:08.041
-and see butterflies and flowers!
-It's a story.

1:32:08.125 --> 1:32:10.083
It's not a story. It's a lie.

1:32:10.166 --> 1:32:13.000
Because they'll never climb trees,
they are never gonna make new friends.

1:32:13.083 --> 1:32:15.791
-Why make them believe that?
-They have to believe in something.

1:32:15.875 --> 1:32:18.166
What is this for
if they don't have anything to believe in?

1:32:18.250 --> 1:32:20.416
-So that they survive!
-Surviving is not living.

1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:22.916
They're gonna die if they listen to you!

1:32:25.166 --> 1:32:28.416
Life is more than just what is. It's
what could be. What you could make it.

1:32:28.500 --> 1:32:31.375
You need to promise them dreams
that may never come true.

1:32:31.458 --> 1:32:34.791
You need to love them knowing
that you may lose them at any second.

1:32:34.875 --> 1:32:38.375
They deserve dreams. They deserve love.
They deserve hope. They deserve a mother.

1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:41.375
They deserve a mother.

1:32:41.875 --> 1:32:44.875
You haven't given them names, Mal.
Their names are Boy and Girl!

1:32:44.958 --> 1:32:45.791
Think about that.

1:32:45.875 --> 1:32:48.375
Every single decision I have made
has been for them.

1:32:48.458 --> 1:32:50.625
Every single one.

1:32:53.833 --> 1:32:54.875
[door closes]

1:33:10.625 --> 1:33:12.000
You know what I saw?

1:33:14.291 --> 1:33:15.916
At the top of the tree?

1:33:17.500 --> 1:33:19.041
I saw a nest.

1:33:21.625 --> 1:33:22.958
With five birds.

1:33:23.958 --> 1:33:26.000
Sitting on the top branch.

1:33:30.833 --> 1:33:32.375
And then they just flew away.

1:33:58.125 --> 1:34:00.333
[whispers] Got it. Got it. Sit. Sit!

1:34:29.791 --> 1:34:31.166
[Tom] It's safe. Come in.

1:35:05.041 --> 1:35:06.000
Wow.

1:35:06.083 --> 1:35:07.583
No, you did not.

1:35:08.750 --> 1:35:11.375
-They're probably stale.
-Yeah.

1:35:12.333 --> 1:35:13.416
Come here.

1:35:14.666 --> 1:35:15.916
Just how I like 'em.

1:35:17.083 --> 1:35:18.083
I'm sorry.

1:35:20.416 --> 1:35:22.250
-Sorry.
-Me too.

1:35:25.041 --> 1:35:25.958
Come here.

1:35:42.375 --> 1:35:43.583
[Tom] Kids.

1:35:47.750 --> 1:35:49.500
[Malorie] This is strawberry.

1:35:49.583 --> 1:35:51.625
This is what strawberry tastes like.

1:35:55.708 --> 1:35:57.083
[laughs]

1:36:05.583 --> 1:36:07.500
[tires squeal]

1:36:07.583 --> 1:36:09.333
-What's that?
-Quiet.

1:36:09.416 --> 1:36:11.458
[vehicle approaching]

1:36:14.666 --> 1:36:15.708
Shh.

1:36:17.666 --> 1:36:18.708
[man] Anybody home?

1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:21.083
[gunshot]

1:36:21.166 --> 1:36:23.500
[Tom] Take the kids out the back.
I'll distract them.

1:36:23.583 --> 1:36:26.458
If I'm not home in 15 minutes,
you take the kids to the boat and you go.

1:36:26.541 --> 1:36:28.125
-I'm not leaving you!
-Mal.

1:36:28.208 --> 1:36:30.375
-No, I'm not leaving you.
-Listen to me.

1:36:31.333 --> 1:36:32.833
I love you so much.

1:36:34.625 --> 1:36:36.291
I love you. Go.

1:36:36.375 --> 1:36:38.250
-No!
-Go. Please go.

1:36:38.958 --> 1:36:40.083
Be good. Go.

1:36:40.625 --> 1:36:41.458
Go!

1:36:41.541 --> 1:36:42.708
[Tom] I'm coming out!

1:36:44.791 --> 1:36:47.458
-[man] Hey there, friend.
-Can I help you?

1:36:49.458 --> 1:36:50.708
I don't think so, friend.

1:36:50.791 --> 1:36:52.125
We can help you though.

1:36:52.208 --> 1:36:53.666
[Tom] No. Go!

1:36:54.291 --> 1:36:56.416
-Take off your blindfold.
-Stand back.

1:36:56.500 --> 1:36:58.458
-Stand back!
-She's not moving.

1:37:03.708 --> 1:37:05.541
Hey. Got a woman and two kids over here.

1:37:19.708 --> 1:37:20.916
They're coming.

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.250
They won't hurt you.

1:37:23.333 --> 1:37:25.041
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1:37:26.208 --> 1:37:27.416
On the contrary...

1:37:29.041 --> 1:37:31.041
it's a beautiful thing, friend.

1:37:53.750 --> 1:37:55.375
[wind whistles]

1:37:56.791 --> 1:37:58.125
[distorted whispers]

1:38:01.291 --> 1:38:03.291
[rumbling]

1:38:15.291 --> 1:38:17.250
[panting]

1:38:23.166 --> 1:38:24.166
[gunshot]

1:39:13.208 --> 1:39:14.708
[weeping]

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000
[breathing heavily]

1:39:42.041 --> 1:39:43.250
[sniffles]

1:39:53.416 --> 1:39:56.833
[Malorie] Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

1:39:56.916 --> 1:39:59.708
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

1:39:59.791 --> 1:40:04.458
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

1:40:04.541 --> 1:40:05.708
Understand?

1:40:06.916 --> 1:40:08.083
[Girl] Where's Tom?

1:40:09.166 --> 1:40:10.291
He's not coming.

1:40:28.083 --> 1:40:30.750
It's time. It's time. It's time.

1:40:44.458 --> 1:40:45.625
You remember the rapids?

1:40:46.708 --> 1:40:48.708
Remember I told you about the rapids?

1:40:50.250 --> 1:40:51.208
Well, they're close.

1:40:51.291 --> 1:40:56.541
It is very dangerous and there's only
one way for me to navigate through them.

1:40:57.541 --> 1:40:58.625
Somebody has to look.

1:40:59.208 --> 1:41:01.583
-I'll look.
-No. I will decide! Okay? I will decide.

1:41:01.666 --> 1:41:03.541
Just give me-- Just give me a second.

1:41:11.375 --> 1:41:12.250
I'll do it.

1:41:41.916 --> 1:41:43.500
I love you so much.

1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:52.583
[grunts]

1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:54.625
Nobody's looking.

1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:57.041
Okay, nobody's looking.

1:41:58.250 --> 1:41:59.250
Okay?

1:42:09.791 --> 1:42:11.333
Do your eyes. Let's do eyes.

1:42:17.791 --> 1:42:20.916
[Malorie] Come on. Get on your knees.
Stay down low. Hold on tight.

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.666
Don't move. Hold tight.

1:42:38.541 --> 1:42:41.416
[Malorie] Hold tight. Don't let go.
We're gonna be okay.

1:42:42.875 --> 1:42:44.208
Hold on!

1:42:49.625 --> 1:42:51.166
Please hold on. Hold on!

1:42:59.916 --> 1:43:01.083
Ah!

1:43:06.250 --> 1:43:07.250
[Malorie] Ah!

1:43:33.041 --> 1:43:34.125
[Malorie] Girl! Boy!

1:43:44.666 --> 1:43:45.833
Girl! Boy!

1:43:49.916 --> 1:43:51.250
Girl! Boy! Boy?

1:43:52.708 --> 1:43:53.916
Girl!

1:43:57.291 --> 1:43:58.500
[Boy] Malorie.

1:43:59.208 --> 1:44:00.208
Boy!

1:44:00.291 --> 1:44:02.833
-Keep calling me!
-[Boy] Help!

1:44:02.916 --> 1:44:04.708
-[Boy] Malorie.
-Keep calling me.

1:44:04.791 --> 1:44:05.833
Malorie!

1:44:05.916 --> 1:44:07.833
-I'm right here.
-Malorie!

1:44:07.916 --> 1:44:09.791
-I'm coming. Where are you?
-Malorie.

1:44:09.875 --> 1:44:12.458
-Where's Girl? Girl? Girl?
-[bell jingles]

1:44:13.375 --> 1:44:16.208
-Keep ringing. I hear you. Keep ringing.
-[bell jingles]

1:44:16.291 --> 1:44:17.875
[Malorie grunting]

1:44:21.291 --> 1:44:22.666
[bell jingling]

1:44:30.291 --> 1:44:31.750
Keep ringing, Girl.

1:44:32.333 --> 1:44:34.958
Keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1:44:36.791 --> 1:44:38.208
Good girl.

1:44:39.708 --> 1:44:42.750
Okay. Good job. Get up. Stand up.

1:44:44.083 --> 1:44:45.458
[birds chirp]

1:44:45.541 --> 1:44:48.583
[Malorie] Oh, good. Good, good, good.

1:44:48.666 --> 1:44:51.000
Good girl. Okay.
Do you guys hear those birds?

1:44:51.583 --> 1:44:53.875
That's where we're headed.
We just follow that sound.

1:44:53.958 --> 1:44:55.791
-[birds chirping]
-Stay behind me.

1:44:57.333 --> 1:44:59.333
[distorted screeching]

1:45:18.666 --> 1:45:20.958
[panting]

1:45:27.583 --> 1:45:29.208
[Jessica] Psst.
