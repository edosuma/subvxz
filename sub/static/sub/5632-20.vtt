WEBVTT

00:03.933 --> 00:06.368
Whoa, I-I thought we
said that there was no TV

00:06.403 --> 00:08.870
- during the week, Bones.
- Mommy says it's educational.

00:08.906 --> 00:10.530
Well, a frozen body was recovered

00:10.531 --> 00:12.672
from a melting Alaskan ice floe.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.308
Oh, that's just great. So now Christine

00:14.343 --> 00:16.911
can have nightmares about Popsicle Man.

00:16.946 --> 00:19.113
While medical examiners have
yet to identify the body,

00:19.148 --> 00:21.882
it was found in the same northern

00:21.918 --> 00:24.484
Alaska region where
billionaire explorer Henry Charles

00:24.520 --> 00:27.721
mysteriously disappeared 15 years ago.

00:27.756 --> 00:30.524
- You didn't say it was Henry Charles.
- That's merely conjecture.

00:30.559 --> 00:32.959
There hasn't been a formal
identification.

00:32.994 --> 00:35.295
Henry Charles disappeared while
excavating the remains

00:35.330 --> 00:38.565
of another famous
expedition, the Frank Party,

00:38.600 --> 00:40.300
which had a pretty gruesome twist.

00:40.335 --> 00:42.869
Turns out Frank and his
crew cannibalized each other.

00:42.905 --> 00:44.370
- It was a case...
- Okay. That's enough.

00:44.406 --> 00:46.039
that made... Booth.

00:46.074 --> 00:48.274
- What's "cannibalize"?
- Sweetheart, it's just

00:48.310 --> 00:50.416
- when people eat other people.
- Ew.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.261
Bones, you don't have to... You
don't have to tell her that.

00:52.263 --> 00:54.713
The discovery of the Frank
Party is one of the most important

00:54.749 --> 00:56.952
- archaeological finds of this century.
- That's great.

00:56.953 --> 00:58.584
She'll learn all about
that in middle school,

00:58.619 --> 01:00.553
but right now this
little first grade monkey

01:00.588 --> 01:03.288
needs to go get dressed for school.

01:03.324 --> 01:06.258
Do I have to? What if
Lukas pushes Emma again?

01:06.293 --> 01:08.994
Don't let that bully Lukas
push Emma around.

01:09.029 --> 01:10.629
You stand up for your friends.

01:10.665 --> 01:13.466
Do I push Lukas back?

01:14.301 --> 01:15.233
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:15.269 --> 01:17.735
You never push anyone back.

01:17.771 --> 01:19.304
Only use your words, sweetheart.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.738
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:20.774 --> 01:23.442
Bam. Blow it up.

01:23.477 --> 01:25.610
Booth, I don't think you
should be encouraging Christine

01:25.645 --> 01:27.279
to intervene in schoolyard altercations.

01:27.314 --> 01:29.348
Why not? I don't
understand. It's her friend.

01:29.383 --> 01:30.882
Why wouldn't she?

01:30.917 --> 01:32.917
Oh. I-I'm afraid

01:32.953 --> 01:34.886
we'll have to finish
this later. Oh.

01:34.921 --> 01:36.287
I have to get back to
the lab immediately.

01:36.322 --> 01:38.890
Why? Something big?

01:38.925 --> 01:41.325
Yes. That body, uh, the
frozen body on TV,

01:41.361 --> 01:43.127
they've chosen me to identify it.

01:43.162 --> 01:44.629
Wow. Really?

01:44.664 --> 01:46.330
- Okay. Where's my jacket?
- I don't know.

01:46.366 --> 01:47.999
I need my ja... Okay, my keys.

01:48.034 --> 01:49.978
Christine, where's my jacket?!

01:50.277 --> 01:52.169
I have never seen so many reporters

01:52.205 --> 01:53.251
outside the Jeffersonian.

01:53.252 --> 01:54.803
Yeah, with all this hype,

01:54.967 --> 01:56.273
we better hope this is Henry Charles.

01:56.309 --> 01:58.009
Well, either way,

01:58.044 --> 02:00.044
I should probably cancel with my sister.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.512
Oh, is she coming here?

02:01.547 --> 02:03.347
I-I thought you weren't
on speaking terms.

02:03.383 --> 02:05.216
She's trying to make amends

02:05.251 --> 02:07.283
by helping me plan my wedding.

02:07.319 --> 02:11.788
Right. And you actually
think that that's a good idea?

02:11.824 --> 02:14.357
Felicia can be a bully, but...

02:14.393 --> 02:17.661
she's my sister. Maybe
letting her be involved

02:17.696 --> 02:19.663
with the wedding
plans will help us get back

02:19.698 --> 02:21.698
- to the way things used to be.
- You mean

02:21.734 --> 02:23.733
before she was
macking on your boyfriends?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.069
Well, technically, Booth
and I weren't dating

02:26.104 --> 02:27.070
when she kissed him.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.139
Who was kissing Booth?

02:29.174 --> 02:31.574
- Cam's sister.
- After we were done dating,

02:31.609 --> 02:34.010
but-but before you guys were together.

02:34.046 --> 02:35.445
No need to make excuses.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.214
- Booth has kissed many women.
- Well, that's

02:38.250 --> 02:39.882
not the root of my problem with Felicia.

02:39.918 --> 02:41.951
I'd definitely call it a symptom.

02:41.986 --> 02:43.886
I mean, if she's always
competing with you,

02:43.922 --> 02:45.922
what's it gonna be like when
she plans the wedding?

02:45.924 --> 02:46.889
Okay, everyone,

02:46.925 --> 02:49.525
the man of the hour.

02:52.730 --> 02:57.066
Not quite the grand entrance Henry
Charles is used to making.

02:57.101 --> 02:58.633
Hey, remember
the time he hydroplaned

02:58.669 --> 03:02.271
across the Atlantic with those
half-naked supermodels?

03:03.840 --> 03:06.641
'Cause, you know, that was super tacky.

03:06.677 --> 03:07.943
Well, it looks like
you're not gonna need

03:07.978 --> 03:09.611
to do a facial reconstruction.

03:09.646 --> 03:12.247
Why does he look like fruit leather?

03:12.283 --> 03:14.449
A combination of frigid temperatures,

03:14.484 --> 03:16.551
high winds, and UV rays

03:16.587 --> 03:18.352
resulted in

03:18.388 --> 03:20.088
rapid mummification.

03:20.123 --> 03:21.923
Oh, my God.

03:21.959 --> 03:23.925
It's really him.

03:23.961 --> 03:26.194
They found Henry Charles.

03:26.229 --> 03:28.129
Wait, you knew him?

03:29.632 --> 03:32.066
Yeah, I was on his final expedition.

03:32.102 --> 03:33.134
What?

03:33.169 --> 03:34.535
- Seriously?
- I was working

03:34.571 --> 03:37.338
as an intern under Archeologist
Marcus Eldridge.

03:37.373 --> 03:40.040
That is quite an impressive credential.

03:40.076 --> 03:42.477
I... But I don't recall
seeing it on your résumé.

03:42.512 --> 03:43.623
Nor do I.

03:43.748 --> 03:45.346
I was a 20-year-old
undergrad. All I really did

03:45.381 --> 03:47.681
was grunt work... keeping the logs,

03:47.717 --> 03:50.751
cataloging the bones. And when, uh,

03:50.786 --> 03:53.053
Henry went missing...

03:53.089 --> 03:55.489
Wow, Clark. I'm-I'm sorry.

03:55.524 --> 03:57.324
That must have been really hard.

03:57.359 --> 03:59.326
Yeah, it was.

03:59.361 --> 04:01.328
Everyone loved Henry.

04:01.363 --> 04:03.630
We were all in shock the
day he disappeared.

04:03.665 --> 04:06.199
I mean, at least
hypothermia is a relatively

04:06.235 --> 04:08.435
- painless way to go.
- Oh, it is.

04:08.470 --> 04:11.438
But this man did not
die of hypothermia. He died

04:11.473 --> 04:15.074
of sharp instrument trauma to
the left posterior parietal.

04:15.110 --> 04:18.512
Whoa. Are you saying that
Henry Charles was murdered?

04:18.547 --> 04:20.478
No, no, no. Th-That's impossible.

04:20.515 --> 04:21.914
There were only five
of us on the expedition.

04:21.950 --> 04:23.950
We were over 100
miles from civilization.

04:23.985 --> 04:26.019
Based on the damage to the skull,

04:26.054 --> 04:27.854
that's the only explanation.

04:27.889 --> 04:28.821
Dr. Hodgins...

04:28.857 --> 04:29.692
Yeah. I'm on it.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.258
Please step away from
the body, Dr. Edison.

04:32.293 --> 04:34.426
I don't understand.

04:34.462 --> 04:37.329
I'm afraid you are now
one of the suspects.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.158
Wow. So this is the actual hut

05:27.193 --> 05:29.361
that Captain Frank's
crew built from the wreckage

05:29.396 --> 05:30.750
- of the SS Tartarus?
- And you want

05:30.775 --> 05:32.340
to know what they did in that hut?

05:33.099 --> 05:34.966
They chowed down on people burgers.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.201
Wow. I love a good burger,
but that's where I draw the line.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.521
Okay. That's good to know there's

05:38.546 --> 05:39.805
- a line, Aubrey.
- You really think

05:39.839 --> 05:41.806
Clark is capable of murder? I mean,

05:41.841 --> 05:44.809
'cause I've never even seen the
guy, like, raise his voice.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.477
No, no, no. All I know

05:46.512 --> 05:48.146
is that five went on the expedition.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.380
Four of 'em came back.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.982
And one of the four surviving members

05:51.017 --> 05:52.683
is the killer.

05:52.718 --> 05:55.386
Right. We got Marcus
Eldridge, Lead Archeologist.

05:55.421 --> 05:57.921
I recognize him from his
book jacket. Great read. And, uh,

05:57.956 --> 06:00.857
that must be Hazel
Mitchell, the teaching assistant.

06:00.893 --> 06:03.527
And we got Declan Marshall
here. He's the mountain guide

06:03.562 --> 06:05.122
and also Henry Charles' right-hand man.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.331
- And Clark.
- Love the glasses.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.901
So you don't think it's
possible that a local might've snuck in?

06:10.936 --> 06:15.338
Look at this. Look how far
north the expedition site is, right?

06:15.373 --> 06:18.474
Even Santa Claus wouldn't
travel that far north.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.343
Well, according to
Hodgins, the murder weapon

06:20.378 --> 06:22.742
- was a pointed steel tool.
- Come on.

06:22.743 --> 06:24.781
Should be easy enough to
find, right? All of the, uh,

06:24.817 --> 06:27.017
equipment that they
used at the expedition site

06:27.052 --> 06:29.552
should be right here.

06:31.623 --> 06:34.924
Or maybe not so easy.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.336
Whoa.

06:47.371 --> 06:49.951
It's like REI
designed a torture chamber.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.221
Brother, thank you for
getting here on such short notice.

06:52.243 --> 06:53.642
Of course, man. I'm
guessing one of these

06:53.677 --> 06:55.677
- could be the murder weapon?
- Seems likely.

06:55.713 --> 06:58.314
Which is why I'm
actually, uh, trying to replicate

06:58.349 --> 07:00.782
the sharp instrument
force here onto these guys,

07:00.818 --> 07:03.185
which are sensor-enabled plastic skulls.

07:03.221 --> 07:06.187
Now, each smash that I
make, right, when I hit this,

07:06.223 --> 07:07.989
it instantly uploads onto my computer,

07:08.024 --> 07:09.224
which allows me to compare

07:09.259 --> 07:11.259
fracture propagation, uh, kerf depth,

07:11.294 --> 07:12.927
and striation patterns to the wounds

07:12.963 --> 07:14.763
on Henry Charles' skull.

07:14.798 --> 07:16.678
So come around here to
the monitor. I'm gonna do

07:16.700 --> 07:18.834
all the smashing, and I'm gonna have you

07:18.869 --> 07:21.802
compare all the
impressions from the weapons

07:21.838 --> 07:24.172
to the X-rays of Henry Charles' skull.

07:24.207 --> 07:25.567
Why do you get to do the fun part?

07:25.569 --> 07:28.142
Oh, yeah, sorry. House rules.

07:28.178 --> 07:30.311
King of the lab does all the smashing.

07:33.116 --> 07:35.183
Hey, you don't actually
think there's a chance

07:35.218 --> 07:37.017
that Clark could have done it?

07:37.052 --> 07:39.319
No. Definitely not.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.790
But...

07:43.860 --> 07:44.879
I don't know, man.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.088
It does seem weird, though

07:46.089 --> 07:48.596
that he would be on one of
the most infamous expeditions

07:48.631 --> 07:51.331
in modern history, but
he'd never talk about it.

07:52.435 --> 07:54.768
It was probably traumatic for him.

07:56.438 --> 07:59.106
All I know is that
Clark is definitely innocent.

07:59.141 --> 08:02.575
Agreed. Which is why we now
have to find some hard evidence

08:02.611 --> 08:04.945
in order to prove it.

08:14.022 --> 08:16.723
Hey. Clark.

08:16.758 --> 08:18.157
- How's it going?
- Brought you

08:18.192 --> 08:19.926
- some reinforcements.
- No, thanks.

08:19.961 --> 08:22.429
How can you say "no, thanks" to
that? Come on, have a donut.

08:22.464 --> 08:24.631
You know, we just want to
ask you some questions about

08:24.666 --> 08:25.626
- the Charles Expedition.
- I'm gonna

08:25.651 --> 08:26.698
have to stop you right there, Booth.

08:26.734 --> 08:28.334
I've retained legal representation,

08:28.369 --> 08:29.701
and, off their advice,

08:29.737 --> 08:32.138
I invoke my right to remain silent.

08:32.173 --> 08:34.807
Look, Clark, this is
just a friendly visit.

08:34.842 --> 08:36.375
We're not accusing you of anything.

08:36.410 --> 08:38.010
We just want to get
a little inside Intel

08:38.046 --> 08:39.812
on how the team dynamics worked.

08:39.847 --> 08:41.914
And I wish I could help
you, but my lawyer's instructions

08:41.950 --> 08:43.248
were clear. I am not

08:43.283 --> 08:44.850
at liberty to answer
any of your questions.

08:44.885 --> 08:46.852
Come on. I just...

08:48.989 --> 08:52.057
I didn't find any
particulates on the victim's clothes.

08:52.092 --> 08:53.855
Hopefully, I'll have better
luck with the skin.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.993
The skin may be intact,

08:55.028 --> 08:57.573
but the skeleton is a
bone fracture bonanza.

08:57.739 --> 08:59.744
Distinguishing all the perimortem
fractures from

08:59.746 --> 09:01.108
the jagged postmortem breaks is

09:01.133 --> 09:02.733
- gonna take a while.
- Hey, you guys,

09:02.769 --> 09:06.028
- look who I found.
- Felicia!

09:06.176 --> 09:08.706
It is so great to see
you. Um,

09:08.741 --> 09:11.943
- I didn't expect you until noon.
- Hey, you know,

09:11.979 --> 09:14.946
uh, you can wait in my
office, and Cam can meet you there.

09:14.982 --> 09:16.413
You don't mind, do
you? It's just this is

09:16.449 --> 09:17.849
a really important case.

09:17.884 --> 09:19.216
That's okay. I get it.

09:19.251 --> 09:21.185
Just tell me when you
want to reschedule,

09:21.220 --> 09:23.287
and I'll try and sweet-talk my boss

09:23.322 --> 09:25.222
into giving me another day off.

09:26.926 --> 09:28.559
Come on, Cam. You should go.

09:28.595 --> 09:30.862
Oh, go, Cam. It's for
your wedding day, you know?

09:30.897 --> 09:32.562
You need all the time you can get.

09:32.598 --> 09:34.398
Oh, not the way I've got it planned.

09:34.433 --> 09:37.767
Come on, girl. You and
I are on a schedule.

09:37.803 --> 09:40.837
Look, I promise I'll call
you if anything big comes up.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.406
Yeah.

09:43.476 --> 09:44.875
Okay.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.780
Have a good time!

09:50.816 --> 09:53.216
This is interesting. The
skull and the upper torso

09:53.251 --> 09:55.619
have a lot more
postmortem fractures than the legs.

09:55.654 --> 09:57.248
- What does that mean?
- Based on the

09:57.273 --> 09:58.580
depressed and radiating fractures

09:58.581 --> 10:00.123
on the neurocranium, the victim suffered

10:00.158 --> 10:01.658
a rapid deceleration impact,

10:01.693 --> 10:03.459
possibly from a very great distance.

10:03.495 --> 10:05.294
So Henry Charles fell?

10:05.330 --> 10:07.796
Fell or was pushed.

10:07.832 --> 10:09.465
That doesn't make sense.
Let me show you something.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.567
So, check out this satellite image

10:11.602 --> 10:15.104
of the dig site. Now, the
topography is totally flat.

10:15.140 --> 10:16.739
According to this map, there's
nothing tall enough

10:16.774 --> 10:19.808
for Henry Charles to have fallen from.

10:24.181 --> 10:26.381
I don't understand why everyone's

10:26.417 --> 10:28.851
treating this Eldridge guy like
he's some Indiana Jones.

10:28.886 --> 10:30.553
All he did was find some old boat.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.721
Well, Dr. Eldridge
was the lead archeologist

10:32.757 --> 10:35.457
on the expedition that
discovered the Frank Party.

10:35.492 --> 10:38.660
If archeology were hockey,
he would be Dwayne Gretzky.

10:38.695 --> 10:40.875
Wayne Gretzky. Get it
right. Wayne. Wayne.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.497
Well, like many archeologists,

10:42.533 --> 10:44.866
Eldridge is also trained
in forensic anthropology.

10:44.901 --> 10:48.670
The methodology he used on
the Frank Party corpses

10:48.705 --> 10:51.440
has been replicated on
multiple excavations.

10:51.475 --> 10:53.975
Skills that would make him a
good suspect in the murder.

10:54.010 --> 10:55.677
You could say the same about any of us,

10:55.712 --> 10:57.144
which is why you can't rule Clark out.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.312
Oh.

10:58.347 --> 10:59.814
Hmm?

10:59.849 --> 11:01.049
Oh, dear.

11:01.084 --> 11:02.349
Is it bad news from the lab?

11:03.787 --> 11:05.667
Christine's teacher, she-she
says that Christine

11:05.689 --> 11:07.421
called Lukas a troglodyte.

11:08.524 --> 11:09.724
She's using her words.

11:09.759 --> 11:10.692
Booth.

11:10.727 --> 11:11.725
Oh, come on, Bones,

11:11.760 --> 11:13.026
she's defending her friend.

11:13.062 --> 11:14.861
Well, Christine should
not have gotten involved

11:14.897 --> 11:15.829
in the first place.

11:15.864 --> 11:16.509
Bones, you know what,

11:16.510 --> 11:18.699
you could learn
something from your daughter.

11:18.734 --> 11:20.767
What, if you are
trying to imply that I should

11:20.803 --> 11:23.270
show more support for
Clark, I fundamentally disagree.

11:23.306 --> 11:26.440
It is essential for my
work that I remain unbiased.

11:26.476 --> 11:28.642
Look, all I'm saying is
if it was one of my guys,

11:28.677 --> 11:30.644
okay, in this
situation, I would do everything

11:30.679 --> 11:32.045
in my power to save the guy.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.448
What?

11:35.484 --> 11:36.883
I'm very proud

11:36.919 --> 11:37.985
of that, Marcus Eldridge.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.419
There we are.

11:40.522 --> 11:41.688
Marcus...

11:41.724 --> 11:44.190
Eldridge, with love.

11:44.226 --> 11:45.425
Don't push.

11:45.460 --> 11:48.228
I promise I'm gonna sign every book.

11:48.263 --> 11:49.762
All right, excuse me, ladies,

11:49.797 --> 11:51.697
but class is over,
right? FBI Special Agent

11:51.733 --> 11:53.833
Seeley Booth. This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

11:53.868 --> 11:55.635
Dr. Brennan.

11:55.670 --> 11:57.870
It's an honor to finally meet you.

11:57.905 --> 12:00.806
Oh, I imagine it is.

12:00.842 --> 12:03.943
You're certain that Henry was murdered?

12:03.978 --> 12:05.498
- Without a doubt.
- Which means

12:05.513 --> 12:07.613
it was somebody from your expedition.

12:07.649 --> 12:09.249
Anyone have a
problem with Henry Charles?

12:09.283 --> 12:11.316
No, there was no friction whatsoever.

12:11.352 --> 12:13.318
Our group was a finely tuned machine

12:13.354 --> 12:15.420
comprised of top scientific minds.

12:15.456 --> 12:16.555
With one exception.

12:16.590 --> 12:18.223
According to Henry Charles'

12:18.259 --> 12:19.824
old correspondence,

12:19.860 --> 12:22.628
you were not his first
choice for lead archeologist.

12:22.663 --> 12:24.029
You were his third.

12:24.064 --> 12:26.632
I was fully informed

12:26.667 --> 12:28.133
about Henry's selection process,

12:28.169 --> 12:29.768
but it only made me more grateful

12:29.803 --> 12:31.170
to be involved in the end.

12:31.205 --> 12:34.072
Henry's work was extraordinarily
well-received.

12:34.107 --> 12:37.075
And if Henry Charles were
still alive today,

12:37.110 --> 12:38.677
all the credit for the discovery

12:38.712 --> 12:40.578
would surely have gone
to him instead of you.

12:40.613 --> 12:41.612
Remind me,

12:41.648 --> 12:43.014
how long was that book of yours

12:43.050 --> 12:44.050
on the best-selling list?

12:44.051 --> 12:46.685
No, you have it all wrong.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.219
Henry was my friend.

12:48.254 --> 12:49.688
He was also my benefactor,

12:49.723 --> 12:51.556
and had he lived, he
surely would've funded

12:51.591 --> 12:53.457
all of my expeditions for years to come.

12:53.493 --> 12:54.425
Right, which is why

12:54.460 --> 12:56.694
you took off from
the dig site without him.

12:56.729 --> 12:58.396
Hmm, yeah, well, a storm came in.

12:58.431 --> 13:00.731
If we hadn't left when we
did, we all would have died,

13:00.766 --> 13:02.933
but you can read about it, Agent Booth.

13:02.968 --> 13:04.235
Here, chapter 14.

13:04.270 --> 13:05.936
- Oh, trust me, I will, thanks.
- Hmm.

13:05.971 --> 13:07.204
Excuse me, Agent.

13:07.239 --> 13:09.773
Those actually retail for $18.99.

13:13.579 --> 13:15.779
But in this case, it's yours.

13:15.815 --> 13:18.582
I'll sign it if you like.

13:27.755 --> 13:29.288
Listen,

13:29.323 --> 13:30.689
I know things have been rocky

13:30.725 --> 13:31.890
between us the past couple years,

13:31.925 --> 13:33.424
but I am gonna

13:33.460 --> 13:34.960
make it up to you by helping you plan

13:34.995 --> 13:36.661
the perfect wedding.

13:36.696 --> 13:38.096
Let's start with the music.

13:38.132 --> 13:39.497
You press, I drive.

13:39.532 --> 13:41.666
Oh, I don't know how to work

13:41.701 --> 13:43.001
this fancy thing.

13:43.036 --> 13:44.402
Oh, it's super user-friendly.
Just go under

13:44.437 --> 13:45.437
playlists and hit the one

13:45.472 --> 13:46.437
labeled "Cam's Wedding".

13:46.473 --> 13:47.939
Okay.

13:51.678 --> 13:53.077
Nice!

13:53.112 --> 13:56.314
So, now you're our
wedding planner and our DJ?

13:56.349 --> 13:57.548
Lord, no. Girl,

13:57.584 --> 13:59.216
this is a compilation

13:59.252 --> 14:00.918
of the top ten local R&B bands.

14:00.953 --> 14:02.520
All you need to do is pick

14:02.555 --> 14:03.788
which one you like best.

14:03.823 --> 14:05.055
I have never seen you

14:05.091 --> 14:06.390
this organized.

14:06.425 --> 14:08.259
Honey, I know that the
last thing you want

14:08.294 --> 14:11.428
is to spend the next year
having everybody fussing over you.

14:11.463 --> 14:15.266
Now reach in the
back and grab that binder.

14:17.870 --> 14:20.037
What is all this?

14:20.072 --> 14:22.906
Locations, caterers, florists,

14:22.941 --> 14:24.574
honeymoon ideas.

14:24.610 --> 14:27.977
All you need to do is kick
back and fill in the checklist.

14:28.013 --> 14:29.879
Okay.

14:29.915 --> 14:32.182
I thought you said you wanted
to make this quick

14:32.217 --> 14:33.684
so you could get back to your case.

14:33.719 --> 14:35.452
I do.

14:35.487 --> 14:38.054
Then I suggest you get started.

14:38.089 --> 14:40.389
Aye-aye, captain.

14:40.425 --> 14:41.958
I am on it.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.566
Angie, found the murder weapon.

14:50.601 --> 14:51.567
It's a high-end ice Axe.

14:52.637 --> 14:53.569
Yikes.

14:53.604 --> 14:55.103
Do you know whose it was?

14:55.139 --> 14:56.419
Oh, no, they issued these babies

14:56.441 --> 14:57.840
to everyone on the
team, but I'm thinking

14:57.875 --> 14:59.809
that the killer may have
held it like this.

14:59.844 --> 15:01.109
Yeah, that-that...

15:01.145 --> 15:02.911
just a little bit close to my head.

15:02.947 --> 15:04.380
Sorry, sorry.

15:04.415 --> 15:05.815
Uh, you had
something you want to show me.

15:05.850 --> 15:08.684
Yeah, so, I've
been studying the site

15:08.720 --> 15:10.052
where they found Henry Charles' body.

15:10.087 --> 15:12.020
Check this out.

15:12.056 --> 15:13.222
Hold on, I thought that the

15:13.257 --> 15:14.456
head fracture suggested

15:14.491 --> 15:16.091
that he fell from great distances.

15:16.126 --> 15:17.459
I mean, come on, that-that

15:17.494 --> 15:19.962
shelf is probably, what, ten feet tops?

15:19.997 --> 15:21.230
Well, it is now,

15:21.265 --> 15:22.831
but look what happens when I input

15:22.867 --> 15:25.367
the weather data from ten years ago.

15:29.740 --> 15:33.140
Oh, wow, talk about climate change.

15:33.176 --> 15:36.811
Yeah, the iceberg Henry Charles
was frozen inside of

15:36.847 --> 15:38.813
used to be part of a giant cliff.

15:38.849 --> 15:40.147
You see that crack?

15:40.183 --> 15:41.215
Yeah, it's an ice crevasse.

15:41.251 --> 15:42.917
It's easily 80 feet deep.

15:42.952 --> 15:44.285
That would explain his fall.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.953
Man, if only there was a way

15:45.989 --> 15:48.522
for us to know who was up there
with him when he died.

15:48.557 --> 15:50.091
Oh, well, there might be.

15:50.126 --> 15:51.792
I made scans of the log books

15:51.827 --> 15:53.067
that Brennan borrowed from that

15:53.096 --> 15:55.292
lead archeologist, and the team took

15:55.401 --> 15:57.464
very detailed notes
about who was working

15:57.500 --> 15:59.033
which dig site and when.

15:59.068 --> 16:00.701
Great, then, Angie, all
we got to do is figure out

16:00.736 --> 16:02.102
who was working Dig Site #3

16:02.137 --> 16:03.670
at the top of the
ridge with Henry Charles

16:03.706 --> 16:06.072
the day he disappeared.

16:06.108 --> 16:07.474
Bingo.

16:07.510 --> 16:09.410
Hazel Mitchell.

16:13.048 --> 16:15.749
So, this was the
original Frank Party campsite

16:15.785 --> 16:17.617
and we found their
old ship-timber hut here.

16:17.652 --> 16:19.852
Our set-up was here.

16:19.888 --> 16:21.554
Base camp, everyone had a sleep tent.

16:21.589 --> 16:22.889
We had a communications tent,

16:22.925 --> 16:25.525
as well as a mess hall and a latrine.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.628
It was... all very glamorous.

16:28.663 --> 16:30.263
Okay, well, Henry Charles' body

16:30.299 --> 16:33.599
was, uh, dumped in the
crevasse in that ridge.

16:33.635 --> 16:35.100
And according to the log,

16:35.136 --> 16:36.903
you were there working alone that day.

16:36.938 --> 16:38.137
Uh, no,

16:38.172 --> 16:40.306
actually, I was scheduled to be there,

16:40.341 --> 16:42.274
but at the last
minute, Declan called me off.

16:42.310 --> 16:43.476
He said it wasn't safe.

16:43.511 --> 16:44.911
- Declan Marshall?
- Yes.

16:44.946 --> 16:48.581
He was Henry's
outdoor guru or something.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.615
High on brawn, low on brains.

16:50.651 --> 16:54.353
He closed the ridge that day
to conduct avalanche blasting.

16:54.388 --> 16:55.787
You didn't record that in the log.

16:55.896 --> 16:57.735
What can I say? I-I got distracted.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.658
You do realize that you're a suspect

16:59.693 --> 17:01.260
in a murder investigation.

17:01.295 --> 17:04.762
I have an alibi, if
that's what you're looking for.

17:04.798 --> 17:06.731
I was with our college
intern, Clark Edison.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.467
Clark Edison,

17:08.502 --> 17:10.335
right, well, according to the log,

17:10.369 --> 17:12.604
Clark Edison was on sleep break.

17:12.638 --> 17:14.606
Well, I was with him,

17:14.641 --> 17:17.108
and we definitely were not sleeping.

17:21.949 --> 17:23.314
So, you watch

17:23.349 --> 17:24.315
the game last night?

17:24.351 --> 17:25.648
No, went to bed early.

17:25.685 --> 17:28.386
Total blowout. You didn't miss much.

17:28.421 --> 17:29.920
Come on, man.

17:29.956 --> 17:32.790
Did you really bring me
here to talk about baseball?

17:32.825 --> 17:36.027
Sorry, guess I'm just a little nervous.

17:36.062 --> 17:38.129
This whole, uh, taking the fifth thing,

17:38.164 --> 17:40.163
I don't understand why you're doing it.

17:40.199 --> 17:42.967
It makes you seem... guilty.

17:45.170 --> 17:47.170
Were you in a
relationship with Hazel Mitchell?

17:50.810 --> 17:52.042
You were, weren't you?

17:52.077 --> 17:54.111
Is that what this is about?

17:54.146 --> 17:55.813
Are you really trying to get me to talk?

17:55.848 --> 17:58.148
No, I'm-I'm just trying to help you.

17:58.183 --> 17:59.583
We both know that you didn't do it.

17:59.618 --> 18:01.584
Well, I'm sorry, but
you're wasting your time.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.053
Come on, Clark.

18:03.088 --> 18:04.087
I'm your friend.

18:04.123 --> 18:05.288
I only want what's best for you.

18:05.324 --> 18:06.656
Yeah, I know you do,

18:06.691 --> 18:07.957
but the best thing for
me to do right now

18:07.993 --> 18:09.692
- is to keep my mouth shut.
- Dr. Edison,

18:09.728 --> 18:11.161
is it true you're the prime suspect

18:11.196 --> 18:12.362
in Henry Charles' murder?

18:12.398 --> 18:13.663
Why'd you do it, Clark?

18:13.698 --> 18:14.697
Hey, back off!

18:14.733 --> 18:16.733
It's okay. It's better if I go.

18:16.768 --> 18:18.568
You work for the
Jeffersonian, too, don't you?

18:18.570 --> 18:20.937
Isn't it a conflict of
interest having lunch with a suspect

18:20.938 --> 18:24.574
while you're in the
middle of a murder investigation?

18:24.609 --> 18:26.175
Well, that was a disaster.

18:26.210 --> 18:29.378
The press crashed our
lunch, plus, Clark gave me nothing.

18:29.414 --> 18:30.779
Well, don't take it personally.

18:30.814 --> 18:32.381
How could I not? Seven
years of friendship

18:32.417 --> 18:33.882
and it's like he doesn't even trust me.

18:33.918 --> 18:35.217
Well, you can't blame him

18:35.253 --> 18:37.719
for prioritizing his legal defense.

18:37.755 --> 18:40.056
Mr. Bray, please take a look at this.

18:40.091 --> 18:42.425
It's a remodeled
fracture on the distal end,

18:42.460 --> 18:43.759
anterior aspect of

18:43.794 --> 18:45.194
the right femur.

18:45.229 --> 18:47.262
Based on the degree of
ossification, I'd say

18:47.297 --> 18:49.397
this wound occurred
roughly two years prior to death.

18:49.433 --> 18:50.566
I concur.

18:50.601 --> 18:53.501
The triangular shape suggests

18:53.537 --> 18:55.070
some kind of sharp force trauma,

18:55.105 --> 18:58.239
possibly from a hunting
knife or an arrowhead.

18:58.275 --> 19:00.275
What about a spearfishing gun?

19:00.310 --> 19:01.843
I-I swear, I read something

19:01.879 --> 19:05.046
about this in a
magazine article this morning.

19:05.082 --> 19:07.348
Well, the date of the incident is

19:07.384 --> 19:09.784
compatible with the
remodeling of the wound.

19:09.819 --> 19:11.018
According to this article,

19:11.054 --> 19:12.187
Declan Marshall accidentally

19:12.222 --> 19:13.988
shot his boss while the two were

19:14.023 --> 19:16.023
spearfishing in the Virgin Islands.

19:16.059 --> 19:19.426
It's possible this was
a failed murder attempt.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.822
Hey, I have the results of the swab

19:20.830 --> 19:22.463
from Henry Charles' hand.

19:22.498 --> 19:24.699
It showed dynamite residue.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.266
Why would someone bring explosives

19:26.302 --> 19:27.635
to an archeological dig?

19:27.670 --> 19:28.769
Well, in mountainous,

19:28.805 --> 19:30.370
sub-zero climates like Alaska,

19:30.406 --> 19:33.107
dynamite is used to
trigger controlled avalanches.

19:33.142 --> 19:36.743
Yes, but the only person with
the expertise to do that

19:36.778 --> 19:40.280
was Charles' right hand
man, Declan Marshall.

19:41.683 --> 19:43.450
Damn right,

19:43.486 --> 19:45.619
I'm broken up about it. I
spent a lot of time with Henry.

19:45.654 --> 19:46.753
Rock climbing El Capitan,

19:46.788 --> 19:48.388
canyon diving New Zealand,

19:48.424 --> 19:50.557
white water rafting in Sierra Leone,

19:50.593 --> 19:51.725
whatever his current obsession,

19:51.760 --> 19:53.059
I was right there next to him.

19:53.095 --> 19:54.227
Can you tell us

19:54.262 --> 19:55.428
where you were the day

19:55.463 --> 19:56.395
he disappeared on this map?

19:56.431 --> 19:57.998
Yeah, um...

19:58.033 --> 20:00.133
here, here, and over here.

20:00.168 --> 20:01.901
I was setting off
avalanche charges, making sure,

20:01.937 --> 20:03.003
you know, the entire mountain

20:03.038 --> 20:04.337
didn't come down on top of us.

20:04.372 --> 20:06.239
Convenient way to hide a body.

20:06.274 --> 20:08.641
My job was to keep Henry
alive, not kill him.

20:08.676 --> 20:10.176
And plus, he was nowhere near the ridge.

20:10.211 --> 20:11.177
I specifically told

20:11.212 --> 20:12.612
everyone to steer clear.

20:12.647 --> 20:14.480
Well, our lab found traces of dynamite

20:14.516 --> 20:15.714
on Henry Charles' hands.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.317
Yeah, because he was an idiot.

20:18.353 --> 20:19.818
This monster storm was coming in,

20:19.854 --> 20:21.754
and I specifically
told him we had to fly out,

20:21.789 --> 20:24.423
but he refused to go until
all the bodies were exhumed.

20:24.459 --> 20:25.891
We got in a fight and
he grabbed the dynamite

20:25.926 --> 20:27.026
to keep me from walking away.

20:27.061 --> 20:28.627
That's when he went missing.

20:28.663 --> 20:29.928
This wasn't the first time

20:29.964 --> 20:31.130
you two fought, was
it? These are Henry's

20:31.165 --> 20:32.197
hospital records

20:32.232 --> 20:33.799
from your trip to Tortola.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.134
You know, the one where you, uh,

20:35.169 --> 20:36.735
shot him with the spearfishing gun.

20:36.771 --> 20:39.171
That idiot shot himself.

20:39.206 --> 20:41.073
What kind of a dummy jumps off a boat

20:41.108 --> 20:42.307
with a loaded spear-shooter?

20:42.342 --> 20:44.209
Henry could hurt
himself inside a padded box.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.645
That's why he needed me
around to keep him safe.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.214
Safe? Henry Charles went
missing under your watch.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.149
In less than 24
hours, you get a helicopter

20:51.185 --> 20:52.784
to pick you up, and you left him there.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.553
N-No-No. Y-You've got that backwards.

20:54.588 --> 20:57.055
We stayed an extra 24
hours after the pilot arrived

20:57.090 --> 20:58.489
because Henry was missing.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.024
Wait, what? What do you mean?

21:00.060 --> 21:01.025
The weather was getting worse,

21:01.061 --> 21:02.393
so I went behind Henry's back

21:02.428 --> 21:04.062
and asked the pilot to
fly in the day before.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.897
I knew he'd be pissed, but
I wanted to be ready to leave

21:05.932 --> 21:06.931
at a moment's notice.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.532
You're saying that the helicopter pilot

21:08.568 --> 21:10.134
was with you on the day he disappeared.

21:10.170 --> 21:13.204
Uh, yeah. A local
gal, um, uh, Alice Tuug.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.938
And I knew Henry'd be mad, so I had her

21:14.973 --> 21:16.240
land the chopper out of
sight, just over the ridge,

21:16.275 --> 21:17.441
and wait for us.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.310
Alice Tuug.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.612
She's not on our suspect list.

21:24.346 --> 21:26.466
Declan wanted me ready to leave
on an instant's notice

21:26.479 --> 21:28.345
with a storm coming
in, but he didn't want

21:28.381 --> 21:30.147
Henry Charles to know.

21:30.182 --> 21:33.550
So I agreed to land my
chopper out of sight,

21:33.585 --> 21:35.619
just behind this ridge.

21:35.654 --> 21:37.821
So Henry Charles was willing

21:37.856 --> 21:40.323
to put everyone's life at
risk for this expedition.

21:40.358 --> 21:43.960
If that storm hit with us
stuck right in the middle of it,

21:43.996 --> 21:46.530
I can guarantee you none of
us would have made it out.

21:46.565 --> 21:47.931
Convenient explanation,

21:47.966 --> 21:49.365
but this wasn't the first time

21:49.401 --> 21:51.734
that you butted heads with
Mr. Charles, was it?

21:51.769 --> 21:54.170
You were arrested during
a violent demonstration

21:54.205 --> 21:55.505
at one of his events.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.840
His company was trying to develop

21:57.875 --> 22:00.309
a mining operation on
sacred native land.

22:00.345 --> 22:03.846
Look, Alice, the fact is that
you were at the expedition site

22:03.881 --> 22:05.781
with no one else
around to see where you were,

22:05.816 --> 22:08.116
or what you were doing at the exact time

22:08.152 --> 22:09.885
that Henry Charles was killed.

22:09.921 --> 22:11.486
Look, I didn't kill him.

22:11.522 --> 22:13.121
And I don't know who did,

22:13.157 --> 22:15.424
but he was definitely still
alive when I showed up.

22:15.459 --> 22:18.193
And how do you know that if
you stayed out of sight?

22:18.228 --> 22:21.296
After I landed, I had some
time on my hands, so I hiked up

22:21.331 --> 22:23.098
to the top of the ridge.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.799
That's when I saw Henry

22:24.834 --> 22:27.169
go inside the Frank Party
hut, and he wasn't alone.

22:27.204 --> 22:28.903
Any idea who he was with?

22:28.939 --> 22:31.005
I was too far away to tell.

22:31.041 --> 22:33.741
Everyone in the
expedition wore the same dark jacket,

22:33.777 --> 22:36.010
except for Henry, he wore red.

22:36.046 --> 22:37.745
But based on their body language,

22:37.781 --> 22:40.682
it was pretty obvious they
were in some kind of an argument.

22:45.121 --> 22:48.289
Okay, so if Alice
Tuug was telling the truth,

22:48.324 --> 22:49.691
then Henry Charles got into an argument

22:49.726 --> 22:50.892
on the day he was murdered

22:50.927 --> 22:52.126
with someone from his expedition

22:52.161 --> 22:53.527
inside of this hut.

22:53.563 --> 22:54.796
So you think that
this is the crime scene.

22:54.831 --> 22:55.964
It could be.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.498
If we could find the crime scene,

22:57.533 --> 22:59.166
and maybe we could find some more clues.

22:59.202 --> 23:02.236
Okay. All right, then I am on it.

23:03.106 --> 23:06.373
Whoa.

23:07.276 --> 23:08.576
Um... so.

23:08.611 --> 23:10.644
I don't think that the Frank Party

23:10.679 --> 23:13.814
built their little hut
here to be handicap accessible.

23:13.849 --> 23:15.048
Guess not.

23:15.084 --> 23:17.217
Well, I can do it.

23:17.252 --> 23:19.285
Do you know how?

23:19.321 --> 23:21.287
Hodgins, it's a flashlight.

23:21.323 --> 23:22.956
It's not rocket science.

23:24.192 --> 23:26.292
Fine. Have my fun.

23:33.067 --> 23:37.270
Man, I can barely see anything.

23:37.305 --> 23:40.706
Well, I can see everything,

23:40.742 --> 23:43.109
and I think what I'm
seeing is a lot of blood.

23:43.145 --> 23:44.444
It looks like three

23:44.479 --> 23:47.312
or four feet of wall, half
the floor, covered.

23:47.348 --> 23:50.482
Is it like one distinct blob?

23:50.518 --> 23:52.852
No, it looks more like a
sprinkler went off and left

23:52.887 --> 23:54.453
pools here and there.

23:54.488 --> 23:56.122
Sounds like arterial spray.

23:56.157 --> 23:57.322
Is that what you'd expect

23:57.358 --> 23:58.691
from an ice Axe to the skull?

23:58.726 --> 24:00.459
Possibly. If it hit the carotid.

24:00.494 --> 24:01.994
One thing is for certain,

24:02.030 --> 24:05.997
Henry Charles was
definitely killed inside this hut.

24:11.605 --> 24:14.339
Hey, Hodgins
said they found the crime scene.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.141
Yes, but it doesn't do us any good.

24:16.177 --> 24:19.678
Every member of that
team had access to that hut.

24:19.713 --> 24:21.813
This is very frustrating.

24:21.848 --> 24:24.949
I just wish that we could say something.

24:24.985 --> 24:28.586
Publicly. And-and...
and stand up for Clark.

24:28.621 --> 24:30.621
Well, it wouldn't do Dr. Edison any good

24:30.657 --> 24:33.825
if we were to compromise the
prosecution of the case.

24:35.228 --> 24:38.663
It just... it doesn't seem right.

24:40.166 --> 24:43.434
There appears to be butterfly fracturing

24:43.469 --> 24:45.069
on the left zygomatic.

24:45.104 --> 24:46.804
The location and nature of the wound

24:46.839 --> 24:50.174
suggests a closed-fisted blow to the face

24:50.210 --> 24:51.775
by a right-handed assailant.

24:51.811 --> 24:55.913
Wow, so that was quite a
punch to fracture the bone.

24:55.948 --> 24:57.848
Well, that's it.

24:57.883 --> 25:01.118
I-I-In order to apply
enough force to do so,

25:01.153 --> 25:03.087
the killer must not
have been wearing gloves.

25:03.122 --> 25:05.155
Right. Right, because
they were inside the hut,

25:05.191 --> 25:06.556
so that makes sense,

25:06.592 --> 25:08.192
but what difference does that make?

25:08.227 --> 25:11.928
Absence of gloves means
we may be able to detect

25:11.963 --> 25:14.030
a knuckle pattern on the tissue.

25:14.065 --> 25:16.065
And that means that all we need to do

25:16.101 --> 25:17.867
is match it to one of our suspects.

25:29.914 --> 25:31.180
Can I pick 'em,

25:31.216 --> 25:32.882
or can I pick 'em?

25:32.917 --> 25:34.717
Doesn't this seem a little plain?

25:34.753 --> 25:36.052
Well, uh, it just...

25:36.087 --> 25:37.620
it feels like
something I'd wear to work.

25:37.655 --> 25:39.756
That's why I picked it.

25:39.791 --> 25:41.757
I know you. You're not
the type to waste money

25:41.792 --> 25:43.592
on a dress you'd wear only once.

25:43.628 --> 25:45.093
You're more sensible than that.

25:45.129 --> 25:47.263
Now get back in there,

25:47.298 --> 25:50.399
and try on these other
dresses I picked out for you.

25:51.902 --> 25:53.235
Also, be quick if you can,

25:53.271 --> 25:54.436
because the florist will
be here any minute

25:54.472 --> 25:55.512
to go over flower options.

25:55.539 --> 25:56.872
Oh, wait. I didn't agree

25:56.907 --> 25:58.673
to pick out flower arrangements today.

25:58.708 --> 26:02.410
And I have a job back in
Philly that I left to help you.

26:02.445 --> 26:03.845
Is your job more important than mine?

26:03.881 --> 26:05.446
- No, I'm not saying that.
- I mean, really,

26:05.482 --> 26:08.049
is the killer gonna be any
less guilty later today?

26:08.085 --> 26:10.218
Felicia, this isn't any other case.

26:10.254 --> 26:11.787
This involves a good friend of mine.

26:11.822 --> 26:14.789
I'm not telling you to ditch out on it,

26:14.824 --> 26:16.424
but I had to call in every favor

26:16.459 --> 26:17.659
I have so that we could

26:17.694 --> 26:18.893
get all the planning done today.

26:18.928 --> 26:22.163
Can you just go with the flow for once?

26:24.133 --> 26:27.168
Fine. Uh, another half hour.

26:27.203 --> 26:28.403
Terrific.

26:28.438 --> 26:29.804
And if you're not sold on the dresses,

26:29.839 --> 26:31.605
I can find a few more options.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.307
Nothing princess-y, totally your style.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.641
Felicia,

26:34.677 --> 26:36.844
I want you to know, I really appreciate

26:36.879 --> 26:39.413
how much work you've put in to all this.

26:39.448 --> 26:43.951
Great. So what do you
think about simple beiges

26:43.986 --> 26:45.886
and light pinks as your color spectrum?

26:45.922 --> 26:47.521
Oh, beige. Isn't that a little...

26:47.556 --> 26:49.222
Harsh on most people's skin tones?

26:49.257 --> 26:51.692
Yes, but I figured you
didn't want any bridesmaids,

26:51.727 --> 26:54.294
and it's such a dignified color scheme.

27:00.001 --> 27:02.001
So, can I see it?

27:02.037 --> 27:05.805
Uh, no, uh, I'm-I'm not sure.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.040
Look, if it's not love,

27:07.075 --> 27:09.542
the one you tried on already

27:09.577 --> 27:11.811
is the perfect Camille Saroyan.

27:31.366 --> 27:34.333
Hey. Is this the
model of our killer's hand?

27:34.369 --> 27:36.101
Yeah. It's based on

27:36.136 --> 27:39.171
the knuckle prints Brennan
found on the victim's cheek tissue.

27:39.206 --> 27:40.638
Now all I have to do is compare it

27:40.674 --> 27:42.674
to our suspects' hand measurements.

27:42.709 --> 27:44.676
But why are there
only four sets of prints?

27:44.711 --> 27:46.478
Was Aubrey not able to get everyone's?

27:46.513 --> 27:48.513
Everyone except Clark.

27:48.548 --> 27:50.215
Man, if Clark would just cooperate,

27:50.251 --> 27:52.550
he'd seem a hell of a lot less guilty.

27:55.589 --> 27:57.255
No match.

27:57.290 --> 28:00.892
Which means we're left with
only one potential suspect.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.770
The evidence doesn't lie, Dr. Edison.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.234
- We know you punched Henry Charles.
- Yeah, but I didn't kill him.

28:12.270 --> 28:14.270
Clark, it's to your
benefit to say nothing.

28:14.305 --> 28:15.605
Fine.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.406
- Clark.
- No. No.

28:17.442 --> 28:18.775
Look, you want your story?

28:18.810 --> 28:20.342
Look, I punched Henry,

28:20.378 --> 28:22.445
because I caught him and
Hazel together in her tent,

28:22.480 --> 28:23.813
and I just lost it.

28:23.848 --> 28:25.448
I'm having trouble with the timeline.

28:25.483 --> 28:29.418
Did you strike him in
the tent, or in the hut?

28:29.454 --> 28:31.053
In the hut. It was...
it was later that day.

28:31.089 --> 28:32.489
Listen, I'm not proud of what I did,

28:32.523 --> 28:34.356
but Henry was using her,

28:34.392 --> 28:37.226
- and Hazel meant everything to me.
- So you,

28:37.261 --> 28:41.830
you hit him to stand up
for yourself, and Hazel.

28:41.865 --> 28:43.765
Yeah, I just...

28:43.801 --> 28:46.635
I did a lot of stupid things for Hazel.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.104
- Like murder?
- No.

28:49.139 --> 28:53.008
But while she was
excavating Captain Frank's body,

28:53.043 --> 28:55.043
she chipped the C4 vertebra.

28:55.079 --> 28:58.213
The log books do not indicate
any damage to Frank's remains.

28:58.248 --> 29:00.148
And that's where the
stupid part comes in.

29:00.183 --> 29:03.351
Hazel was devastated by her mistake.

29:03.386 --> 29:06.887
She was embarrassed, and
I agreed not to log it.

29:06.923 --> 29:08.923
You compromised the data?

29:08.958 --> 29:12.393
That is a serious breach of your
integrity as a scientist.

29:12.429 --> 29:15.295
I know. I allowed my
feelings for someone

29:15.331 --> 29:17.424
to get in the way of
my responsibilities.

29:17.425 --> 29:19.033
Okay, let's just shut the
feelings down right now

29:19.068 --> 29:20.434
and get back to what happened

29:20.469 --> 29:22.236
after you hit Henry Charles.

29:22.271 --> 29:25.472
I stormed out... alone, to calm down.

29:25.508 --> 29:28.242
And by the time I got back, we
realized Henry was missing.

29:28.277 --> 29:29.543
Great, so not only

29:29.578 --> 29:32.012
were you the last
person to see him alive,

29:32.047 --> 29:34.014
but you don't have an alibi.

29:34.049 --> 29:37.451
Look, I know how this looks, Booth.

29:39.087 --> 29:40.887
Please, you have to believe me.

29:40.922 --> 29:42.956
Look, we've worked
together for nearly a decade,

29:42.991 --> 29:45.825
if there's anyone who
could prove my innocence,

29:45.861 --> 29:48.394
it's you.

29:53.434 --> 29:56.469
I can reexamine the evidence,

29:56.504 --> 29:59.272
but I'm afraid that's the best I can do.

30:58.598 --> 31:00.998
Hey, Bones.

31:01.034 --> 31:03.067
Booth, what are you doing here?

31:03.103 --> 31:04.736
I got some coffee and some fuel for you

31:04.771 --> 31:06.170
and the, uh, the squints, here.

31:06.206 --> 31:08.072
- That's so thoughtful.
- Well, what can I say,

31:08.108 --> 31:09.874
I'm a thoughtful kind of a guy, right?

31:09.909 --> 31:11.542
Look, I know you're a bookworm
and all, but I thought you told

31:11.577 --> 31:14.411
Clark that you were going
to reexamine the evidence?

31:14.447 --> 31:17.981
I am. I'm re-reading Eldridge's book.

31:18.016 --> 31:19.350
He writes with great detail

31:19.385 --> 31:21.418
about the emotional state of the team,

31:21.454 --> 31:22.853
but the book makes no reference

31:22.888 --> 31:24.921
to their interpersonal conflicts.

31:24.957 --> 31:26.790
So he fudged a few of the details.
What's the big deal?

31:26.825 --> 31:28.558
What does that have to
do with Clark's case?

31:28.593 --> 31:30.693
Well, this was a best-selling work

31:30.729 --> 31:33.764
of scientific non-fiction.
It should be accurate.

31:33.799 --> 31:35.632
Scientific accuracy
doesn't get your book

31:35.667 --> 31:37.667
on the best-seller list for
72 weeks, that's for sure,

31:37.702 --> 31:40.070
I'll tell you what. You know what does?

31:40.105 --> 31:42.806
People chowing down on their buddies.

31:42.841 --> 31:46.476
Well... it is a shame they
didn't get a better photo

31:46.511 --> 31:48.171
of the cannibalized
bones. I mean, this one...

31:48.196 --> 31:48.878
Let's take a look.

31:48.913 --> 31:50.913
- Is horribly out of focus.
- Well... yeah, you know,

31:50.915 --> 31:52.248
you're right, I guess squints

31:52.284 --> 31:54.116
don't make the best photographers.

31:54.152 --> 31:56.419
Unless...

31:56.454 --> 31:59.355
the poor photo quality was intentional.

31:59.391 --> 32:03.259
Done so that it would be
impossible to scrutinize.

32:03.294 --> 32:05.861
I will let you know when
I have something.

32:05.897 --> 32:07.997
Was it... Did I say something?

32:12.336 --> 32:14.670
Brennan, what is this about?

32:14.705 --> 32:17.138
We have been looking at
the wrong set of bones.

32:17.174 --> 32:18.740
I know I'm running on zero sleep,

32:18.776 --> 32:20.809
but don't tell me I
missed another victim?

32:22.012 --> 32:24.813
No, these bones are
from the Frank Party.

32:24.848 --> 32:27.649
One of two cannibalized skeletons
Eldridge was able

32:27.685 --> 32:30.619
to evacuate before the storm.

32:30.654 --> 32:32.086
Mr. Bray,

32:32.122 --> 32:33.788
what do you make of these cut marks?

32:33.824 --> 32:36.124
They appear to be
shallow slices, likely caused

32:36.159 --> 32:38.226
by the tools used to
remove the flesh for eating.

32:38.261 --> 32:39.894
You are mistaken.

32:39.930 --> 32:41.429
The implements
available to the Frank Party

32:41.464 --> 32:43.198
would have left broader kerf marks.

32:43.233 --> 32:46.500
And the edges would grow
more ragged as the blade dulled,

32:46.536 --> 32:49.170
but none of these
did. They're all identical.

32:49.206 --> 32:51.305
Couldn't they have
sharpened their knives on something?

32:51.341 --> 32:53.341
Well, yes, but based on
the knife-sharpening technology

32:53.376 --> 32:55.209
of the 1800s, you'd see evidence

32:55.244 --> 32:57.445
- of rolled edges.
- Precisely.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.314
These cuts were made with multiple,

33:00.350 --> 33:03.917
identical scalpel-sharp
blades. Modern blades.

33:03.953 --> 33:05.886
Wait a minute, are you saying that...

33:05.921 --> 33:07.554
The Frank Party didn't eat each other.

33:07.589 --> 33:09.923
The cannibalism was faked.

33:19.484 --> 33:21.951
You lied. We have conclusive proof

33:21.986 --> 33:26.255
that you falsified evidence of
the Frank Party cannibalism.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.891
That's ridiculous. Why would I do that?

33:28.927 --> 33:30.326
Well, a boring run-of-the-mill shipwreck

33:30.361 --> 33:31.861
doesn't exactly sell books.

33:31.896 --> 33:34.129
So you figured you'd
turn the Yawner Party

33:34.165 --> 33:35.564
into the Donner Party.

33:35.599 --> 33:37.799
Only, Henry Charles caught you

33:37.835 --> 33:39.734
adulterating the
bones. So you killed him

33:39.770 --> 33:41.570
before he had a chance to expose you

33:41.605 --> 33:43.405
as the fraud you truly are.

33:43.441 --> 33:46.208
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to make a name for yourself

33:46.243 --> 33:48.777
in archaeology? So I
faked a few details.

33:48.812 --> 33:51.312
- That does not make me a killer.
- Right.

33:51.348 --> 33:53.014
Henry Charles just happened to disappear

33:53.049 --> 33:55.784
right after he
threatened to expose your scam.

33:55.819 --> 33:58.052
Sometimes you get lucky.

33:58.088 --> 34:00.054
Not this time.

34:00.090 --> 34:03.758
You may discredit me as
a scientist, Dr. Brennan.

34:03.794 --> 34:07.628
You will never
prove that I'm a murderer.

34:11.301 --> 34:13.766
We've been at this for a
while, and we still haven't found

34:13.803 --> 34:15.803
anything that ties
Eldridge to the murder.

34:15.838 --> 34:17.405
Dude, I've swabbed every nanometer
of that head wound.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.107
There's nothing.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.442
Nothing from the brain
tissue at the wound site, either.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.878
- That's Charles' brain?
- Yeah. It was mummified

34:23.913 --> 34:26.714
- when it came in, so I rehydrate it.
- Dehydrated?

34:26.748 --> 34:29.181
It's like those capsules that
turn into sponge animals.

34:29.217 --> 34:32.252
Michael-Vincent loves those. As do I.

34:32.286 --> 34:34.989
Oh, my God. That's it.

34:35.024 --> 34:36.824
Think of the brain as a sponge.

34:36.859 --> 34:39.426
As the cerebral crevices dried up,

34:39.460 --> 34:41.895
Charles' brain condensed
into a tighter form,

34:41.929 --> 34:43.830
folding trace evidence in with it.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.166
But when you rehydrate
it, the tissue expanded.

34:46.201 --> 34:48.135
Allowing the
particulates from the wound site

34:48.170 --> 34:49.936
to migrate down one
of the porous pathways

34:49.971 --> 34:51.271
into the brain's center.

34:51.306 --> 34:53.340
So we need to section the entire brain,

34:53.375 --> 34:55.507
not just the area proximate
to the wounds.

34:55.543 --> 34:57.343
Already on it.

35:02.584 --> 35:05.284
Oh, wow.

35:05.319 --> 35:07.453
Really makes you rethink deli meat.

35:07.488 --> 35:09.656
And I'm officially never eating again.

35:09.691 --> 35:12.658
I'm with you. At least I'll fit into

35:12.693 --> 35:15.561
whatever wedding
dress Felicia chose for me.

35:15.596 --> 35:17.196
Why's she choosing
it? It's your wedding.

35:17.231 --> 35:19.198
Which is why I'm trying
to keep the peace.

35:19.233 --> 35:21.467
Last thing I need on my wedding
day is family drama.

35:21.502 --> 35:23.302
Hey, not to butt in, but if Angela and I

35:23.337 --> 35:25.104
have learned anything from
my being in this chair,

35:25.139 --> 35:26.738
it's that a person can't possibly know

35:26.774 --> 35:28.373
what you're thinking
unless you tell them.

35:28.408 --> 35:30.776
There.

35:32.012 --> 35:33.812
I see something.

35:38.719 --> 35:41.286
Based on the discoloration,

35:41.321 --> 35:44.222
this is a sliver of very old bone.

35:44.257 --> 35:46.424
That proves it was Marcus Eldridge.

35:46.460 --> 35:48.993
He must have gotten that
bone chip caught on his ice Axe

35:49.028 --> 35:51.296
as he was faking the cannibal cuts.

35:51.331 --> 35:53.398
- Then we got him.
- Not so fast.

35:53.433 --> 35:55.433
Something's not right. This bone chip

35:55.469 --> 35:57.302
didn't come from the
cannibalized remains.

35:57.337 --> 35:58.769
How can you tell?

35:58.805 --> 36:00.165
The slight sloping on this crevice

36:00.173 --> 36:01.505
is what you'd see

36:01.540 --> 36:02.580
on the bid Spinoza process

36:02.609 --> 36:03.841
of a C4 vertebra.

36:03.876 --> 36:05.442
But I just examined those remains

36:05.478 --> 36:07.678
with Dr. Brennan, and
neither C4 vertebrae

36:07.714 --> 36:10.247
were damaged, which
means Marcus Eldridge

36:10.282 --> 36:12.116
isn't the killer

36:12.151 --> 36:13.484
But I know who is.

36:18.857 --> 36:20.657
You must have been quite humiliated

36:20.692 --> 36:24.428
when you realized you'd
damaged Captain Frank's remains.

36:24.463 --> 36:26.497
You brought me back in here for that?

36:26.532 --> 36:30.065
It was an accident.
The damage was minor.

36:30.205 --> 36:32.102
Really, minor, like this size?

36:32.138 --> 36:34.137
That is a chip of 150-year-old

36:34.172 --> 36:36.472
C4 vertebra. My lab found it

36:36.508 --> 36:39.009
embedded in Henry Charles' brain.

36:39.044 --> 36:40.677
See, we figured out that
this piece of bone

36:40.712 --> 36:43.013
got stuck in your ice
Axe... the one that you used

36:43.048 --> 36:45.515
to manhandle Captain Frank's remains.

36:45.550 --> 36:47.517
The bone then migrated
to Henry Charles' brain

36:47.552 --> 36:50.520
when you killed him with
the very same Axe.

36:53.625 --> 36:55.924
You have no idea what I was up against.

36:55.960 --> 36:59.362
I-I did all of my graduate
work under Marcus Eldridge.

36:59.397 --> 37:02.398
My entire career rode
on his recommendation.

37:02.433 --> 37:04.900
If the academic world discredited
your advisor,

37:04.935 --> 37:06.835
you would have lost your credibility.

37:06.871 --> 37:08.203
You couldn't take the
chance that Henry Charles

37:08.238 --> 37:09.638
would expose the truth.

37:13.277 --> 37:15.243
Eldridge couldn't
even pull off a forgery

37:15.279 --> 37:17.680
in the most remote place on this earth.

37:17.715 --> 37:20.115
And then Henry comes
along and wants me to help him

37:20.151 --> 37:23.018
- go public with Eldridge's lies?
- Right, so you just

37:23.054 --> 37:24.286
hit him over the head,

37:24.321 --> 37:26.221
and you tossed him in
an 80-foot crevasse.

37:26.256 --> 37:28.423
It was either that or
kiss my career good-bye.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.259
And I was not about to
let all of that hard work

37:31.295 --> 37:33.595
go down the drain.

37:37.033 --> 37:39.033
I wonder how Clark feels,

37:39.069 --> 37:41.836
knowing that he was in
love with a murderer.

37:41.871 --> 37:43.537
Well, he's not a suspect anymore.

37:43.573 --> 37:45.506
I'd say he's feeling pretty good.

37:45.541 --> 37:47.008
Am I interrupting?

37:47.043 --> 37:48.743
Hey.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.178
What are you doing here?

37:50.213 --> 37:52.646
Got your wedding binder organized.

37:52.682 --> 37:56.317
Everything's set, all you
need to do is pick a date.

37:56.352 --> 37:58.285
Wow, that was fast.

37:58.321 --> 37:59.853
It's what Cam wanted.

37:59.888 --> 38:01.955
Really?

38:03.192 --> 38:04.692
Actually, it isn't.

38:04.727 --> 38:07.761
Wait. Please don't tell
me you want to elope.

38:07.796 --> 38:09.663
After all the favors I had to call in?

38:09.699 --> 38:11.832
No, I don't want to elope either.

38:11.867 --> 38:13.967
You've lost me.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.937
I know it's silly, but I can't help it.

38:16.972 --> 38:18.438
I...

38:20.008 --> 38:22.142
I want the poof dress

38:22.177 --> 38:24.811
and the champagne waterfalls and
the personalized candy bars

38:24.847 --> 38:27.447
and the bridesmaids and
the ten-piece band.

38:27.482 --> 38:29.849
They have personalized candy bars?

38:31.219 --> 38:32.184
Why didn't you tell me?

38:32.220 --> 38:33.386
Because I was embarrassed.

38:33.421 --> 38:34.721
It's a little girl's fantasy.

38:34.756 --> 38:36.289
And I just don't want us

38:36.324 --> 38:37.523
to fight anymore.

38:37.559 --> 38:41.026
Cam, we're sisters.

38:41.062 --> 38:44.631
Our relationship ebbs
and flows, that's life.

38:44.666 --> 38:48.634
I love you. That doesn't change.

38:48.669 --> 38:51.837
When did you get so mature?

38:51.873 --> 38:54.306
Around the time I felt terrible

38:54.341 --> 38:56.375
about making out with your boyfriend.

38:56.410 --> 38:57.730
Oh, please don't tell me

38:57.745 --> 38:59.044
you made out with Barstool also?

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
Your wedding is one
of the most important

39:01.115 --> 39:03.181
days of your life. All I want

39:03.216 --> 39:06.017
is to help make it everything
you want it to be.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.857
Oh, sorry... listen, uh,

39:12.893 --> 39:15.059
if you do plan on having bridesmaids,

39:15.095 --> 39:16.461
just promise me

39:16.497 --> 39:17.763
you won't do beige,

39:17.798 --> 39:20.564
'cause it washes out my skin tone.

39:23.036 --> 39:24.502
Fine.

39:33.847 --> 39:36.547
Dr. Edison. Please come in.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.015
I'm happy to see you.

39:38.050 --> 39:40.050
Well, I'm only here because of you.

39:40.085 --> 39:42.720
I simply did my job.

39:42.755 --> 39:45.856
Did you really think I
could have killed Henry Charles?

39:45.891 --> 39:48.659
It would have been a disservice to you

39:48.695 --> 39:51.295
for me to consider my personal beliefs,

39:51.331 --> 39:52.863
but no,

39:52.898 --> 39:55.699
I never thought you
were capable of such a crime.

39:55.734 --> 39:57.634
Right. Because my true crime

39:57.669 --> 39:59.502
is falsifying evidence.

39:59.538 --> 40:01.071
It's all over the news.

40:01.106 --> 40:02.372
They're crucifying me.

40:02.407 --> 40:04.808
It has caught my attention.

40:04.844 --> 40:08.378
Which is why I'll be
tendering my resignation.

40:08.413 --> 40:11.748
I should have known the
cannibalism was a fraud.

40:11.783 --> 40:13.850
Any forensic anthropologist

40:13.885 --> 40:15.852
worthy of the Jeffersonian would have.

40:15.887 --> 40:18.154
You were not a forensic anthropologist
at the time.

40:18.189 --> 40:20.156
You were an undergrad persuaded
by your professor.

40:20.191 --> 40:22.925
Yes. But a good scientist

40:22.961 --> 40:25.294
relies only on his own analysis.

40:25.330 --> 40:28.197
Dr. Edison, please take
a look at the latest copy

40:28.233 --> 40:30.599
of The Forensic Anthropology Times.

40:30.634 --> 40:32.101
Is it an article written by you?

40:32.136 --> 40:34.871
Yes. You shouldn't
be so hard on yourself.

40:34.906 --> 40:36.372
The entire scientific world

40:36.407 --> 40:38.774
bought into Marcus Eldridge's deceit.

40:38.809 --> 40:41.177
Wait, is this an
article in defense of me?

40:41.212 --> 40:44.346
Mistakes make for better
scientists, Dr. Edison.

40:44.382 --> 40:46.615
Every expert today has made

40:46.650 --> 40:48.884
a past error of some kind.

40:48.919 --> 40:52.921
Besides, that's what
friends and teammates do.

40:52.956 --> 40:56.425
They stand up for each other.

40:57.862 --> 41:00.495
Oh...

41:01.899 --> 41:05.166
I suggest you get back to work.

41:05.202 --> 41:08.336
I imagine tasks have piled
up since you've been away.

41:40.970 --> 41:42.869
I've never
seen Christine so messy.

41:42.905 --> 41:44.638
Thankfully, I think

41:44.673 --> 41:45.906
that's the last of the mud.

41:45.942 --> 41:47.441
Come on over and have a drink.

41:47.476 --> 41:50.043
I tell you, I'm really
proud of my two girls

41:50.078 --> 41:51.445
for standing up for their friends.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.178
Christine didn't stand up for anyone.

41:53.213 --> 41:56.014
She voluntarily joined Emma in the mud

41:56.050 --> 41:57.683
after Lukas pushed her in.

41:57.718 --> 41:59.217
Solidarity, Bones, all right?

41:59.253 --> 42:01.654
She jumped into that mud

42:01.689 --> 42:03.856
with Emma to make a point, just like you

42:03.891 --> 42:06.926
made a point with that
essay you wrote about Clark.

42:06.961 --> 42:09.828
Some point. Marcus Eldridge
has been totally discredited,

42:09.863 --> 42:12.730
he's being sued for
fraud, and yet he just landed

42:12.766 --> 42:14.232
a two million dollar book deal

42:14.268 --> 42:17.002
to write an exposé on
the Charles Expedition.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.837
Two million dollars? Wow, I
should write an exposé on you,

42:18.872 --> 42:20.232
and I'll finally get that ice rink

42:20.240 --> 42:21.573
I always wanted in the back.

42:21.608 --> 42:23.475
Well, an exposé on me would be fruitless,

42:23.510 --> 42:25.177
as I have no secrets.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.946
And if we had an extra two million
dollars lying around,

42:27.981 --> 42:30.314
Booth, we wouldn't buy
an ice rink. Come on.

42:30.350 --> 42:32.684
I know... a yacht.

42:32.719 --> 42:34.486
No, Christine gets seasick.

42:34.521 --> 42:35.920
Plane.

42:35.956 --> 42:37.221
Well, that's not very

42:37.256 --> 42:38.289
Eco-friendly, Booth.

42:38.324 --> 42:39.604
Okay, what do you suggest, then?

42:39.626 --> 42:41.960
I don't know... solar panels?

42:41.995 --> 42:43.204
Solar panels? I'm talking

42:43.229 --> 42:44.462
- hypothetical here.
- Yes.

42:44.497 --> 42:46.730
Well, hypothetically, I
would get solar panels.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.245
You have two million dollars to spend,

42:48.267 --> 42:49.600
and that's what you're gonna choose?

42:49.635 --> 42:51.668
Yes, well, I have to do
something to balance out

42:51.704 --> 42:53.604
the carbon footprint
of your private plane.
