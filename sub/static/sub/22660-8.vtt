The Black Lotus, one of
the most popular restaurants

00:21.095 --> 00:22.494
in the heart of Chicago's Chinatown.

00:22.496 --> 00:23.728
Great food. Great service.

00:23.730 --> 00:25.497
Oh, and it's run by the Triads.

00:25.499 --> 00:27.866
Tien, the boss, has got awesoe
dim sum cooking in the kitchens.

00:27.868 --> 00:29.535
And a pretty tasty chemical weapon

00:29.537 --> 00:31.070
cooking in a secret lab upstairs.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.503
You gotta order that one off the menu.

00:32.506 --> 00:33.838
Table for one?

00:33.840 --> 00:35.140
I'm here to see Tien.

00:36.242 --> 00:38.277
I don't know any Tien.

00:39.612 --> 00:40.579
Uh-huh...

00:41.681 --> 00:43.247
You gonna to take me to him?

00:43.249 --> 00:44.816
Or am I gonna take myself?

00:50.757 --> 00:53.024
There goes baldy, calling over the muscle.

00:53.026 --> 00:54.459
His name's Shawn.

00:54.461 --> 00:57.228
Head of security for this Triad
and Tien's personal bodyguard.

00:57.230 --> 00:58.229
Real friendly guy.

00:58.231 --> 00:59.797
He wants to see Tien.

00:59.799 --> 01:00.965
Check him out.

01:07.839 --> 01:09.006
Okay, we're in.

01:18.650 --> 01:19.549
Easy enough.

01:27.225 --> 01:29.459
Aim of the game is to
get to that weapons lab.

01:29.461 --> 01:30.927
So far, so good.

01:32.796 --> 01:33.796
Oh no!

01:33.798 --> 01:35.765
Damn it!

01:35.767 --> 01:38.034
We may have been a little hasty there.

01:38.036 --> 01:40.403
Okay, as I said, the Black Lotus.

01:40.405 --> 01:41.871
One of the most popular restaurants

01:41.873 --> 01:43.573
in Chicago's Chinatown distric.

01:43.575 --> 01:46.142
Dim sum downstairs,
chemical weapons upstairs.

01:46.144 --> 01:47.409
You get the picture.

01:49.446 --> 01:50.880
Table for one?

01:50.882 --> 01:52.649
I'm here to see Tien.

01:52.651 --> 01:54.751
I don't know any Tien.

01:54.753 --> 01:56.252
You gonna to take me to him?

01:56.254 --> 01:58.387
Or am I gonna take myself?

02:10.300 --> 02:12.601
Right, and here we go again.

02:12.603 --> 02:15.337
What Frank needs is
some kind of distraction.

02:16.439 --> 02:18.106
I could use the restroom.

02:19.441 --> 02:20.642
Okay, Frank...

02:20.644 --> 02:23.111
I would guess that's as
good an excuse as any.

02:28.217 --> 02:30.018
And thank you Dragon Lady.

02:42.498 --> 02:45.533
Now, to find the entrance
to the chemical lab.

02:45.535 --> 02:47.168
Sensing trouble here.

02:47.170 --> 02:48.236
Sorry...

02:48.238 --> 02:49.604
Don't speak Cantonese.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.707
This is where the fun begins.

02:56.813 --> 02:59.080
I don't think that's on the menu.

03:04.419 --> 03:06.653
Oh man! That puts the "ow" in chow mein!

03:18.267 --> 03:19.833
Between a wok and a hard place.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.537
Lettuce? Seriously Frank?

03:43.458 --> 03:46.225
And that, ladies and
gentlemen, is why Frank Martin

03:46.227 --> 03:47.593
is Frank Martin.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.899
Ha, take that!

03:58.204 --> 03:59.304
- Watch out!

04:16.322 --> 04:17.221
Nice.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.325
Oh, shit!

04:22.195 --> 04:23.762
Here we go again.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.497
One more time.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.931
Anyone else getting a déjà vu?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.600
Table for one?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.067
I don't know any Tien.

04:35.508 --> 04:36.507
Night night, asshole.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.011
All these guys again.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.145
Bruce Lee,

04:41.147 --> 04:42.146
Wok.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.414
Deadly lettuce.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.559
Boom, Frank's done it.

04:58.497 --> 05:00.030
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

05:00.032 --> 05:02.232
Tien's secret lair. His
gang is guarding the weapon.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.101
Who the fuck are you?

05:06.971 --> 05:08.038
It's a private club.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.106
I just joined.

05:13.477 --> 05:16.112
Uh-oh, big mistake, jerkweed.
He hates magic tricks.

05:16.114 --> 05:17.447
I said it's a private club.

05:17.449 --> 05:20.450
Right in his ace of spades.

05:51.514 --> 05:54.549
Uh-oh, that's Tien, crime boss.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.822
Frank? You might wanna look behind you.

06:10.432 --> 06:12.433
Can you get him in?

06:12.435 --> 06:13.434
Yeah.

06:14.536 --> 06:15.904
Can you get him out?

06:17.006 --> 06:17.972
Not alive.

06:19.108 --> 06:20.241
Alive would be good.

07:00.445 --> 07:05.815

07:29.142 --> 07:30.142
Is there a problem?

07:30.144 --> 07:31.977
You could say that. This job's impossible.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.379
Nothing's impossible.

07:34.381 --> 07:37.449
Look, I've gone through this
every which way, Agent Wolfe.

07:37.451 --> 07:39.985
- This warlord, Tien...
- Crime boss, not warlord.

07:39.987 --> 07:41.353
Okay, whatever...

07:41.355 --> 07:43.822
He's got like 20 Bruce Lees on the payroll.

07:43.824 --> 07:46.024
We need you to retrieve
that weapon, Mr. Martin.

07:46.026 --> 07:47.493
I'm just one man.

07:47.495 --> 07:49.194
Why doesn't the FBI raid the place?

07:49.196 --> 07:51.096
Because if we tried, Tien is crazy enough

07:51.098 --> 07:52.763
to release the weapon into the air.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.099
Tens of thousands could die.

07:54.101 --> 07:56.267
Then why don't you get one
of your own men to do it?

07:56.269 --> 07:57.668
I have my reasons.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.770
And Mr. Martin has a
pretty unique skill set.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.272
Border Patrol just called.

08:01.274 --> 08:03.375
Damian Blake is flying in from Dublin.

08:03.377 --> 08:04.476
What? When?

08:04.478 --> 08:05.910
Plane's due to land in 30 minutes.

08:05.912 --> 08:07.211
Why didn't we know this sooner?

08:07.213 --> 08:08.713
Who's Damian Blake?

08:08.715 --> 08:11.281
He's a right-wing radical who
advocates the violent overthrow

08:11.283 --> 08:12.617
of the federal government.

08:12.619 --> 08:15.019
His group wants to give the
government back to the people,

08:15.021 --> 08:16.888
by assassinating the President.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.455
So he's a nutjob?

08:18.457 --> 08:21.558
And a prime buyer for the
weapon Tien just developed.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.360
It's everybody's worst nightmare.

08:23.362 --> 08:25.862
This stuff falling into the
hands of homegrown terrorists.

08:25.864 --> 08:27.297
Check this out.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.935
Who is this guy?

08:31.937 --> 08:33.636
That's one of Tien's men.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.039
He's probably on his way to
the airport to meet Blake.

08:36.042 --> 08:37.774
A hell of a mess.

08:37.775 --> 08:40.043
If he gets that weapon, it's game over.

08:40.044 --> 08:42.477
Does Tien know what Blake looks like?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.480
They've only communicated
over the dark net,

08:44.482 --> 08:46.616
so I'd say almost certainly not. Why?

08:46.618 --> 08:48.351
Blake could be my way in.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.419
How?

08:49.421 --> 08:51.054
Border Patrol stops him at the airport and

08:51.056 --> 08:52.422
I show up in his place.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.357
That's brilliant. You'd have to move fast.

08:54.359 --> 08:58.127
I'll need Tien's men to
pick me up at the airport...

08:58.129 --> 09:00.530
which means you need to
get Blake out of the way.

09:00.532 --> 09:01.597
Okay.

09:01.599 --> 09:02.698
I'll call Border Patrol.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.334
Frank...

09:05.336 --> 09:07.203
This isn't a transporter job anymore.

09:07.205 --> 09:08.938
I'm still collecting a package.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.740
You were asked to retrieve it,
not impersonate a terrorist.

09:11.742 --> 09:12.841
Yeah...

09:12.843 --> 09:15.077
It's not like you've
had much time to prepare.

09:15.079 --> 09:16.178
Got a better idea?

09:19.282 --> 09:20.282
Okay...

09:20.284 --> 09:21.316
I'll brief you on the way to the car.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.101
... Spacial, baby!

09:39.103 --> 09:41.403
What the fuck are you doing?

09:41.405 --> 09:43.472
- You got me killed, you idiot!
- Dai lo...

09:45.373 --> 09:46.407
What you want, Lim?

09:48.677 --> 09:49.911
Take it. Take it!

09:51.179 --> 09:52.546
There's a problem, Dai lo.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.048
There better not be.

09:54.050 --> 09:56.117
The compound is highly unstable.

09:56.119 --> 09:57.251
It's not safe to even move it.

09:57.253 --> 09:58.552
Wait...

09:58.554 --> 10:00.554
You tell me this now?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.789
With respect, Dai lo, I've
been telling you this all along.

10:02.791 --> 10:05.259
A man is coming to take delivery.

10:05.261 --> 10:06.393
You understand?

10:07.496 --> 10:08.695
And we're gonna give it to him.

10:12.534 --> 10:14.235
You got a big brain, Lim.

10:15.670 --> 10:16.903
But you know you're problem?

10:18.006 --> 10:19.405
You got no balls.

10:21.408 --> 10:22.776
Just like your old man.

10:25.647 --> 10:27.547
You want to end up like your old man?

10:30.384 --> 10:32.052
No.

10:32.054 --> 10:33.286
Then get Chimera ready...

10:34.388 --> 10:37.089
Now.

10:55.642 --> 10:56.976
Hang on.

11:01.414 --> 11:02.715
One last thing.

11:04.151 --> 11:05.484
Blake's flying in,

11:05.486 --> 11:07.452
he won't be carrying a weapon.

11:07.454 --> 11:08.520
Well, maybe you should.

11:09.622 --> 11:11.190
That won't be necessary.

11:14.394 --> 11:17.596
Listen, Mr. Martin, you're doing
a great service to this country.

11:18.698 --> 11:20.131
I don't know how to thank you.

11:21.434 --> 11:22.701
Don't thank me yet.

11:24.103 --> 11:26.470
Good luck.

11:53.665 --> 11:54.998
Yeah?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.467
Okay, so you're about 10-15
minutes away from the airport.

11:58.569 --> 11:59.903
I know.

11:59.905 --> 12:02.572
... Blake's plane is
gonna land any minute now.

12:04.776 --> 12:06.009
Jules, what is it?

12:09.714 --> 12:10.948
It's...

12:10.950 --> 12:12.249
It's just...

12:12.251 --> 12:14.751
It's my first day is all, I
don't want to get you killed.

12:14.753 --> 12:16.753
You did already. Three times.

12:16.755 --> 12:19.723
Yeah, that was a simulation but...

12:19.725 --> 12:21.658
Look Frank, this plan is...

12:23.294 --> 12:24.861
Caterina's worried too.

12:24.863 --> 12:26.463
I'll be fine.

12:26.465 --> 12:28.231
Now don't call me again,
unless it's urgent.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.232
Understand?

12:29.234 --> 12:30.266
I understand, yeah.

12:31.368 --> 12:32.368
Jules?

12:32.370 --> 12:33.369
Yeah.

12:33.371 --> 12:34.871
Thanks.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.742
- Forged his passport, huh?
- Yeah.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.213
Nice.

13:22.318 --> 13:24.352
Oh, you just missed a digit there.

13:25.454 --> 13:26.387
Thanks.

13:35.463 --> 13:36.831
On its way.

13:48.977 --> 13:50.211
Sorry, Mr. Blake...

13:50.213 --> 13:52.312
we need to ask you a few questions.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.548
Sure. Is everything alright?

13:56.116 --> 13:57.250
Is there a problem?

14:38.392 --> 14:39.925
What is this about?

15:02.815 --> 15:03.848
Looking for me?

15:05.518 --> 15:07.552
Damian Blake.

15:09.655 --> 15:10.822
You're late.

15:10.824 --> 15:12.023
You noticed.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.158
No luggage?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.193
Like you said, I'm late. Let's go.

15:18.763 --> 15:19.897
Alright, follow me.

15:39.216 --> 15:40.751
Hold it right there!

15:59.971 --> 16:01.104
You want some?

16:22.993 --> 16:24.559
Hello?

16:24.561 --> 16:26.328
We got a problem.

16:26.330 --> 16:27.396
Sorry?

16:27.398 --> 16:28.263
I was stopped at the airport.

16:29.366 --> 16:30.432
Who is this?

16:30.434 --> 16:32.368
Who the fuck do you
think it is? It's Blake.

16:45.014 --> 16:46.515
Hello?

17:33.562 --> 17:35.595
Frank, we couldn't reach you.

17:35.597 --> 17:36.963
Blake's escaped.

17:36.965 --> 17:38.031
I gathered that.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.634
I'm sending you the cell
number Blake's using.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.269
I need Jules to track it.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.336
What are you going to do?

17:44.338 --> 17:45.705
Stop him, of course.

17:48.141 --> 17:49.241
What's up?

17:51.244 --> 17:52.812
You need to track Blake's number.

17:52.814 --> 17:54.246
And send it to Frank immediately.

17:54.248 --> 17:55.682
Okay.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.720
One mile from you.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.935
Six hundred meters, Frank.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.608
Two hundred.

19:40.217 --> 19:41.517
Where are you taking me?

19:45.021 --> 19:46.789
And who the fuck are you?

19:49.059 --> 19:50.660
NSA? CIA?

19:54.964 --> 19:55.998
Okay.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.901
You're a fucking puppet, whoever you are.

19:58.903 --> 20:00.736
I'm a patriot, you understand?

20:03.339 --> 20:06.008
I'm a freedom fighter.

20:06.010 --> 20:08.177
Say something, you fucking
jerk. What are you, a robot?

20:08.179 --> 20:10.012
A fucking socialist robot?

20:11.114 --> 20:12.647
Sell your soul for some shitty car

20:12.649 --> 20:13.948
and a three-bed house
you never even pay out.

20:13.950 --> 20:15.850
You don't even understand
what it means to be free.

20:15.852 --> 20:17.686
Nobody does anymore.

20:17.688 --> 20:19.621
Free to be.

20:19.623 --> 20:20.922
To choose,

20:20.924 --> 20:22.890
want and to take...

20:22.892 --> 20:24.992
who know what it means to get it.

20:26.095 --> 20:27.395
You go to college?

20:28.630 --> 20:29.831
Yeah, sure I did.

20:31.033 --> 20:34.001
Major in philosophy or bullshit?

20:34.003 --> 20:37.205
Oh, so you are a fucking socialist.

20:37.207 --> 20:39.240
But this isn't about me, dickhead.

20:39.242 --> 20:41.809
This isn't about college or education.

20:43.445 --> 20:44.978
Oil and war or...

20:46.080 --> 20:47.648
or fancy interventions or whatever else

20:47.650 --> 20:49.149
you socialist assholes think it is.

20:49.151 --> 20:50.150
This is about

20:50.152 --> 20:52.720
about God-fearing Americans

20:52.722 --> 20:55.522
who're willing to put their
country ahead of themselves,

20:55.524 --> 20:57.458
who are willing to make
the ultimate sacrifice

20:57.460 --> 20:58.659
to defend her.

20:58.661 --> 21:00.394
By killing innocent people?

21:00.396 --> 21:04.564
No, Americans who don't
stand up to tyranny.

21:04.566 --> 21:06.733
They need to wake the
hell up, save our country

21:06.735 --> 21:07.834
before it's too late.

21:09.003 --> 21:10.436
And when we prevail...

21:12.106 --> 21:14.074
We will prevail...

21:14.076 --> 21:16.977
People like me will be
in the history books.

21:16.979 --> 21:20.513
For rescuing America in her hour of need.

21:20.515 --> 21:22.515
We'll be the heroes of our time.

21:23.817 --> 21:25.251
Of all times.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.005
Right now, it's time to be quiet.

21:48.355 --> 21:49.821
You've got nothing on me.

21:51.457 --> 21:53.425
You charging me with something?

21:54.894 --> 21:56.628
This is exactly the type
of tyrannical government...

21:56.630 --> 21:58.430
Shut up! Get him out of here.

22:01.166 --> 22:02.801
You'll all burn.

22:02.803 --> 22:04.603
All of you.

22:05.705 --> 22:06.772
You okay?

22:06.774 --> 22:08.539
I left you a present
on the side of the road.

22:08.541 --> 22:09.640
Tien's pickup man.

22:09.642 --> 22:11.109
We got him already.

22:11.111 --> 22:12.977
You're not still going in there?

22:12.979 --> 22:14.045
That's the idea.

22:14.047 --> 22:15.346
Don't you think Tien
will suspect something,

22:15.348 --> 22:16.580
given that his man's missing?

22:16.582 --> 22:18.682
Probably, he will but so what?

22:18.684 --> 22:20.718
Well, there's another problem.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.486
We decoded some message traffic.

22:22.488 --> 22:24.655
It seems Tien wants
Blake to make a payment.

22:24.657 --> 22:25.790
30 million.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.892
Keeps all his funds on the dark net.

22:27.894 --> 22:29.493
You name it, you can find it on there.

22:29.495 --> 22:31.395
Markets for weapons, drugs...

22:31.397 --> 22:33.130
Secret bank accounts, apparently.

22:33.132 --> 22:36.199
Blake would have a 10-digit
key code to access the funds.

22:36.201 --> 22:38.368
Okay. How do we get that?

22:38.370 --> 22:39.537
We're working on it.

22:39.539 --> 22:40.737
You're working on it?

22:40.739 --> 22:42.105
Tien's waiting.

22:42.107 --> 22:44.274
And even if you do get the code,
how will you get it to Frank?

22:44.276 --> 22:45.943
We have a man on the inside.

22:47.245 --> 22:48.645
Inside Tien's outfit?

22:48.647 --> 22:50.847
He'll be able to share the
code with Frank once we have it.

22:50.849 --> 22:52.382
Alright then.

22:52.384 --> 22:53.817
I'll stall as long as I can.

22:53.819 --> 22:55.085
We'll work fast here, Frank.

22:55.087 --> 22:56.453
But look, if you're going, you gotta go.

22:58.789 --> 23:02.224
Hey, I could really
help you find that code.

23:02.226 --> 23:03.259
Not necessary, kid.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.322
Table for one?

23:22.424 --> 23:23.624
I'm here to see Tien.

23:24.726 --> 23:26.227
I don't know any Tien.

23:28.096 --> 23:29.630
He's expecting me.

23:29.632 --> 23:32.332
Damian Blake.

23:41.609 --> 23:43.243
It's Damian Blake.

23:43.245 --> 23:44.477
He wants to see Tien.

23:45.580 --> 23:46.979
You got ID?

23:56.157 --> 23:57.424
I'd like that back.

23:57.426 --> 23:58.491
You'll get it back.

23:58.493 --> 24:00.260
Later.

24:00.262 --> 24:02.062
Please follow me, Mr. Blake.

24:14.741 --> 24:15.942
He's leaving the dining area.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.092
Okay, he's made it to the kitchen.

24:33.094 --> 24:34.259
He's heading upstairs.

24:34.261 --> 24:35.760
He's good, isn't he?

24:35.762 --> 24:36.761
Yeah.

24:36.763 --> 24:38.396
You said you have a man on the inside.

24:38.398 --> 24:40.164
Yeah, that's right.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.833
Why didn't you tell us before?

24:41.835 --> 24:43.568
The FBI's not in the habit of sharing

24:43.570 --> 24:45.536
its secrets with outside contractors.

24:45.538 --> 24:47.105
That's pretty vital information.

24:47.107 --> 24:49.240
That's the one on the inside
could get us the "in" we needed.

24:49.242 --> 24:51.309
Look, I don't know you.

24:51.311 --> 24:52.776
Hey, I'm just a little paranoid.

24:52.778 --> 24:53.811
What are you talking about?

24:53.813 --> 24:56.380
Louis Tien is the FBI's worst nightmare.

24:56.382 --> 24:59.217
He's a drug dealer who's
graduated to chemical weapons.

24:59.219 --> 25:00.751
And every time I've tried to move on him,

25:00.753 --> 25:02.019
the evidence has vanished.

25:02.021 --> 25:03.020
Bad luck?

25:03.022 --> 25:05.089
Luck has nothing to do with it.

25:05.091 --> 25:07.158
Why do you think I hired a transporter

25:07.160 --> 25:09.326
instead of using one of my own men?

25:09.328 --> 25:10.661
You've got a mole.

25:10.663 --> 25:13.196
Someone in the bureau hates
the government as much as Blake.

25:13.198 --> 25:14.965
They want him to get this weapon.

25:14.967 --> 25:18.068
Well, if that's true, the
mole could be in this room.

25:18.070 --> 25:20.570
They could've already betrayed Frank.

25:20.572 --> 25:22.606
No, I've vetted everyone
on this task force.

25:31.249 --> 25:32.282
Turn around.

25:32.284 --> 25:33.883
Arms stretched out wide.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.228
We've got a problem.

25:46.230 --> 25:47.229
What?

25:47.301 --> 25:49.001
This access code.

25:49.003 --> 25:50.502
We've tried every
decryption routine there is,

25:50.504 --> 25:51.670
but we're getting nowhere.

25:51.672 --> 25:53.606
Well, you could just let me help you.

25:53.608 --> 25:55.007
What are you going to do?

25:55.009 --> 25:57.643
Have you ever heard of
acoustic cryptoanalysis?

25:57.645 --> 25:58.944
The analysis of the sound produced

25:58.946 --> 26:00.045
during encryption processing...

26:00.047 --> 26:01.046
We know what it is.

26:01.048 --> 26:02.381
Yeah, well, I run that puppy,

26:02.383 --> 26:05.150
chances are it can reverse-code
even the most secure site.

26:05.152 --> 26:07.353
Not even the FBI has that capability.

26:07.355 --> 26:08.954
Yeah, well, I do.

26:08.956 --> 26:10.522
You're bluffing.

26:10.524 --> 26:11.457
Let him try it.

26:12.592 --> 26:13.626
He has no clearance.

26:13.628 --> 26:14.793
He does now.

26:14.795 --> 26:16.061
Thank you.

26:23.169 --> 26:24.669
Were you bluffing?

26:24.671 --> 26:25.871
Of course.

26:26.973 --> 26:28.706
Then how are you going to get that code?

26:30.209 --> 26:32.343
I don't know, but if I don't,

26:32.345 --> 26:34.078
they'll kill Frank.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.112
Just do it.

26:37.048 --> 26:38.650
Okay.

26:43.889 --> 26:45.356
Move!

26:52.463 --> 26:53.463
Dai lo,

26:53.465 --> 26:54.698
Mr. Blake is here.

27:02.107 --> 27:04.408
Where the hell you been, you prick?

27:04.410 --> 27:06.142
Your mother know you talk like that?

27:06.144 --> 27:07.210
Answer my question.

27:07.212 --> 27:08.845
Your man didn't show up.

27:10.114 --> 27:11.448
Jimmy hasn't answered his phone.

27:11.450 --> 27:12.916
Why not? Where is he?

27:12.918 --> 27:14.017
I don't know. He's a fuck-up.

27:15.119 --> 27:16.853
You search him?

27:16.855 --> 27:18.755
He's clean.

27:18.757 --> 27:21.457
You ready to transfer the money, Mr. Blake?

27:21.459 --> 27:22.725
I'm ready.

27:22.727 --> 27:24.027
Then let's do this.

27:24.029 --> 27:25.929
But I won't.

27:25.931 --> 27:27.663
Not until I see the product.

27:27.665 --> 27:28.865
What are you talking about?

27:28.867 --> 27:31.100
You don't expect me to pay sight unseen.

27:31.102 --> 27:33.502
Your associates already saw it.

27:33.504 --> 27:35.471
You're here to pay and go, my friend.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.574
Not until I see it for myself.

27:49.553 --> 27:51.086
Are you a cop, kitty cat?

27:53.690 --> 27:54.622
Is that what you are?

27:56.125 --> 27:58.093
Wouldn't tell you if I was, would I?

28:03.199 --> 28:05.234
No...

28:05.236 --> 28:06.468
You sure as fuck wouldn't.

28:08.872 --> 28:10.772
You're a funny guy, Mr. Blake...

28:10.774 --> 28:11.773
You know that?

28:15.544 --> 28:17.144
Ah well...

28:18.247 --> 28:19.947
You don't pay,

28:19.949 --> 28:21.850
you don't leave.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.020
Wait here.

28:42.104 --> 28:44.237
Well?

28:44.239 --> 28:45.773
It's real.

28:45.775 --> 28:47.374
Doesn't make it genuine.

28:47.376 --> 28:48.809
What are you, a fortune cookie?

28:48.811 --> 28:50.544
What the hell does that mean?

28:50.546 --> 28:52.279
The passport.

28:52.281 --> 28:53.881
Blake flew in from Dublin.

28:53.883 --> 28:55.749
Yeah. So?

28:55.751 --> 28:57.684
Take a look.

28:58.787 --> 29:00.320
What?

29:00.322 --> 29:01.888
I don't see anything.

29:01.890 --> 29:02.822
Exactly.

29:06.027 --> 29:07.127
The stamp.

29:08.229 --> 29:10.096
Can't leave Ireland
without getting a stamp.

29:10.098 --> 29:11.798
Somebody was in a hurry.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.599
Somebody who couldn't make a real passport.

29:15.469 --> 29:16.969
Our funny friend's a Fed.

29:25.678 --> 29:27.046
Right this way, Mr. Blake.

29:27.048 --> 29:28.414
Where's Tien?

29:28.416 --> 29:29.514
Waiting up in the lab.

29:59.644 --> 30:00.744
What the hell is this?

30:03.515 --> 30:05.883
You've got a funny way of
treating your customers,

30:05.885 --> 30:06.917
Mr. Tien.

30:06.919 --> 30:08.853
Your passport, you rat.

30:08.855 --> 30:10.387
You forget to get it stamped.

30:10.389 --> 30:12.923
You think I carry only one passport?

30:12.925 --> 30:14.257
In my line of work?

30:44.955 --> 30:48.424
What would he have done with
it if he'd got that weapon?

30:48.426 --> 30:49.692
Men like Blake think

30:49.694 --> 30:51.193
this country's gone so far off track,

30:51.195 --> 30:53.195
the only way to save it is to destroy it.

30:53.197 --> 30:55.932
Like setting off a chemical
weapon at the White House.

30:55.934 --> 30:57.233
Yeah.

30:57.235 --> 30:58.367
Capitol Hill.

30:58.369 --> 30:59.701
Wall Street.

30:59.703 --> 31:00.736
He's a sick man.

31:01.905 --> 31:04.040
A lot of men suffer from the same illness.

31:05.142 --> 31:06.142
Right?

31:06.144 --> 31:07.976
They think they're patriots.

31:07.978 --> 31:10.413
"I have but one life to
lose for my country... "

31:11.515 --> 31:13.282
The FBI will never want for work.

31:14.384 --> 31:15.617
Cat, Agent Wolfe...

31:15.619 --> 31:17.385
Can I please have a word alone?

31:18.487 --> 31:20.288
We are alone.

31:20.290 --> 31:21.890
Yeah, just not here.

31:27.997 --> 31:29.932
Jules, what is it?

31:29.934 --> 31:32.534
I got it. The access code
to Blake's 30 million.

31:32.536 --> 31:33.701
Great. Let's give it to Frank.

31:33.703 --> 31:34.702
There's a problem.

31:34.784 --> 31:36.083
Jules, whatever it is, it can wait.

31:36.085 --> 31:37.918
No. It can't.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.487
What's the matter?

31:39.489 --> 31:42.657
When I located Blake's account,
I could see that somebody had

31:42.659 --> 31:44.359
already accessed it late last night.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.826
10:16 p.m.

31:45.828 --> 31:46.727
Who did?

31:47.829 --> 31:49.930
Well, I tracked the IP address.

31:49.932 --> 31:51.598
It's a laptop, government issue.

31:51.600 --> 31:52.867
No, hang on, government issue?

31:53.969 --> 31:55.269
It belongs to Agent Cleef.

31:55.271 --> 31:56.671
He's your mole.

31:56.673 --> 31:59.173
No, I've known Dan Cleef
for nearly ten years.

31:59.175 --> 32:01.709
Dan's got a wife, he's got two kids.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.678
Are you absolutely sure it's him?

32:03.680 --> 32:05.445
Money was transferred
into the account last night

32:05.447 --> 32:07.747
from an untraceable source.

32:07.749 --> 32:09.816
I mean, that's probably
why he was in Dublin.

32:09.818 --> 32:12.886
Then Blake must have backers funding him.

32:12.888 --> 32:14.721
Zealots who want to
bring down the government

32:14.723 --> 32:16.156
as much as he does.

32:16.158 --> 32:18.158
Cleef's their middleman? I don't buy it.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.393
He was probably just checking to see

32:19.395 --> 32:20.661
that there was money in the account.

32:20.663 --> 32:22.062
It makes sense.

32:22.064 --> 32:23.730
Right now, we can't say anything.

32:23.732 --> 32:26.032
If Cleef knows we know,
he might expose Frank.

32:26.034 --> 32:27.100
He might anyways.

32:27.102 --> 32:28.501
We're gonna make sure that doesn't happen.

32:28.503 --> 32:29.769
Well, I hope so.

32:29.771 --> 32:31.370
And I don't want him in there
talking to Blake anymore.

32:31.372 --> 32:33.673
But right now, we've got
to get the code to Frank.

32:33.675 --> 32:34.540
Okay.

32:37.277 --> 32:39.278
What were you doing in Dublin?

32:39.280 --> 32:41.647
Drinking beer. What do you care?

32:41.649 --> 32:43.115
You know something, Mr. Blake?

32:43.117 --> 32:45.518
I really admire what you stand for.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.453
Blowing up the government and shit.

32:47.455 --> 32:48.721
Is that so?

32:48.723 --> 32:49.855
I had nothing growing up.

32:50.957 --> 32:52.458
Now look.

32:52.460 --> 32:55.127
I built this all by myself.

32:55.129 --> 32:56.695
I'm the American dream.

32:58.264 --> 33:00.332
Selling chemical weapons.

33:00.334 --> 33:02.234
It's called freedom, baby.

33:02.236 --> 33:04.870
You don't see me crying for
no government handouts...

33:04.872 --> 33:08.340
unlike those lazy-ass immigrants
fucking up the economy.

33:16.716 --> 33:17.716
Lim.

33:17.718 --> 33:19.217
Come here.

33:22.321 --> 33:24.088
This is our customer.

33:24.090 --> 33:25.724
Got his package ready?

33:28.193 --> 33:30.361
- It's ready.
- Good.

33:30.363 --> 33:33.664
He's going to need a
little demonstration first.

33:33.666 --> 33:35.566
Think you can arrange that?

33:40.239 --> 33:41.139
Hold on a sec.

33:42.674 --> 33:43.574
Lim...

33:44.809 --> 33:46.910
Tell Mr. Blake who your father was.

33:48.079 --> 33:48.979
A chemist.

33:50.282 --> 33:51.848
A very brilliant man.

33:51.850 --> 33:54.251
Ten times smarter than me.

33:54.253 --> 33:56.920
But he couldn't find a job in this country,

33:56.922 --> 33:58.989
so I had him build this meth lab.

34:00.091 --> 34:01.591
You know where he is now?

34:01.593 --> 34:02.592
I gather you're going to tell me.

34:03.694 --> 34:05.128
Dead.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.997
You know why?

34:06.999 --> 34:08.563
Because when I saw that I could make

34:08.565 --> 34:11.935
ten times more selling a chemical weapon,

34:11.937 --> 34:13.603
the old man wouldn't do it.

34:14.705 --> 34:16.339
Why not, Lim?

34:16.341 --> 34:18.974
Because he thought it was wrong.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.876
And now his son

34:20.878 --> 34:22.712
is doing the same job for me.

34:23.813 --> 34:24.980
And almost as good.

34:27.884 --> 34:30.320
You know what's more
important than being smart?

34:32.956 --> 34:34.123
Being strong.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.726
Let's get on with this.

35:07.890 --> 35:09.490
Cleef? You sent the code?

35:09.492 --> 35:11.425
Just now. Our man has it.

35:11.427 --> 35:13.061
How are you gonna get that code to Frank?

35:13.063 --> 35:14.829
Don't worry, our man will get it to him.

35:14.831 --> 35:15.930
For his own reasons,

35:15.932 --> 35:17.431
he wants to stop Tien
just as much as we do.

35:17.433 --> 35:19.033
He's about to become a very wealthy man.

35:19.035 --> 35:20.034
Not for long.

35:20.036 --> 35:21.535
As soon as Frank delivers us the weapon,

35:21.537 --> 35:24.137
we'll shut down Tien
and get that money back.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.207
What about Blake?

35:27.209 --> 35:28.442
Where are they taking him?

35:28.444 --> 35:30.478
He's got a nice cell
waiting for him at Joliet.

35:31.580 --> 35:32.847
You think that's a good idea?

35:32.849 --> 35:34.849
He's not telling us anything here.

35:34.851 --> 35:36.384
Okay, time to go, Blake.

35:39.622 --> 35:41.454
No, no, freeze! Freeze! Freeze!

35:41.456 --> 35:43.390
Cat, watch out!

35:43.392 --> 35:44.391
Easy.

35:44.393 --> 35:45.625
You're going to give me car keys.

35:45.627 --> 35:46.960
You're not going anywhere, Blake.

35:46.962 --> 35:48.695
Listen to that kid because
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

35:48.697 --> 35:50.297
The second you do that, you're dead, too.

35:50.299 --> 35:52.766
That's the difference between you and me.

35:52.768 --> 35:54.401
I'm not afraid to die for my country.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.735
You're not gonna get very far.

35:55.737 --> 35:56.770
Why don't you shut up, bitch.

35:57.872 --> 35:58.905
Jules...

35:58.907 --> 36:00.807
On the counter beside
me, give him the keys.

36:00.809 --> 36:01.875
What?

36:01.877 --> 36:03.676
Just do it. He's not bluffing.

36:20.794 --> 36:21.994
Check him.

36:21.996 --> 36:23.662
Oh shit!

36:28.768 --> 36:30.201
Nice shot.

36:30.203 --> 36:31.102
Thank you.

36:32.338 --> 36:33.806
Jules.

36:33.808 --> 36:34.840
I'll take those.

36:38.144 --> 36:39.377
You okay, Ms. Boldieu?

36:39.379 --> 36:40.913
Fine.

36:40.915 --> 36:42.247
She just killed him.

36:46.252 --> 36:48.019
Just in time, Shawn.

36:48.021 --> 36:51.122
Lim is about to demonstrate
our product to Mr. Blake here.

36:52.491 --> 36:54.025
As you know,

36:54.027 --> 36:55.393
the hard part with chemical weapons

36:55.395 --> 36:56.694
isn't the chemicals.

36:56.696 --> 36:58.796
Any druggist can make poison.

36:58.798 --> 37:00.065
The problem is,

37:00.067 --> 37:01.833
how do you get it to hang in the air

37:01.835 --> 37:03.534
long enough so it kills lots of people?

37:04.636 --> 37:05.536
Watch this.

37:24.589 --> 37:25.489
Impressive.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.392
The secret's a vapor,

37:28.394 --> 37:30.427
so fine it spreads quickly and

37:30.429 --> 37:32.762
not even the wind can blow it away.

37:33.865 --> 37:35.532
Lim,

37:35.534 --> 37:37.567
tell him what the numbers mean.

37:43.207 --> 37:46.409
A vial this size could
spread across Chicago,

37:46.411 --> 37:48.745
and stay in the air as long as six hours.

37:48.747 --> 37:49.980
On a good day?

37:49.982 --> 37:51.648
That's nearly 10 million people.

37:52.749 --> 37:53.749
Dead.

37:53.751 --> 37:54.984
At 3 bucks a person.

37:54.986 --> 37:57.720
I'd say you're getting a
pretty good deal, Mr. Blake.

37:57.722 --> 37:59.722
How many more of those vials do you have?

37:59.724 --> 38:00.990
Just the ones we made for you.

38:02.092 --> 38:04.093
We even packed it to go for you.

38:10.199 --> 38:13.068
- Not sure how you take it.
- Thanks.

38:13.070 --> 38:14.703
I make a lousy cup.

38:14.705 --> 38:16.104
But you look like you could use this.

38:16.106 --> 38:18.306
I'm alright.

38:18.308 --> 38:20.676
It's not like it's the first time
I've been threatened in this job.

38:20.678 --> 38:21.577
I guess not.

38:22.746 --> 38:24.312
The ambulance is on its way.

38:24.314 --> 38:25.547
Pam is down there waiting with your friend.

38:25.549 --> 38:27.315
Is she alright?

38:27.317 --> 38:28.417
Pamela?

38:28.419 --> 38:30.085
She's as tough as they come.

38:30.087 --> 38:31.719
Must take a lot out of
you, this kind of job.

38:32.821 --> 38:34.189
She would never show it.

38:34.191 --> 38:35.257
She's a true believer.

38:35.259 --> 38:36.291
And you're not?

38:38.561 --> 38:39.727
I love my job.

38:39.729 --> 38:41.396
I love the challenge, but

38:41.398 --> 38:42.630
I have a family.

38:42.632 --> 38:44.365
Whereas Pam...

38:44.367 --> 38:46.200
Sometimes she doesn't
even go home at night.

38:48.437 --> 38:49.771
What about last night?

38:49.773 --> 38:50.772
I'm sorry?

38:50.774 --> 38:51.839
Were you late?

38:51.841 --> 38:52.840
Not last night.

38:52.842 --> 38:54.475
I was home by 9 to tuck in my kids.

38:57.846 --> 38:58.779
Thanks for the coffee.

39:17.231 --> 39:18.799
All packed and ready to go.

39:18.801 --> 39:20.800
But like any restaurant,

39:20.802 --> 39:22.367
you got to pay the check first.

39:25.839 --> 39:27.940
Just type your bank code in there.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.955
You okay?

39:43.957 --> 39:45.591
Yeah, my ears are still ringing but

39:45.593 --> 39:47.292
at least I wasn't the one who
had a gun pointed at his head.

39:47.294 --> 39:48.560
Yeah.

39:48.562 --> 39:50.695
It's not like it's the first time.

39:50.697 --> 39:52.197
So, any word on Frank?

39:52.199 --> 39:53.499
Not yet.

39:53.501 --> 39:55.767
It looks like he's still in the lab.

39:55.769 --> 39:58.302
At least it means that traitor
hasn't gotten him killed yet.

39:58.304 --> 40:00.171
I don't think Cleef's the traitor.

40:01.540 --> 40:03.508
What are you talking about?

40:03.510 --> 40:04.442
Let's go.

40:05.544 --> 40:07.145
What?

40:07.147 --> 40:10.181
You said he had access to
his computer last night.

40:10.183 --> 40:11.616
- Yeah.
- But he wasn't here.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.851
You know who was working late?

40:13.853 --> 40:15.186
Wait.

40:15.188 --> 40:16.420
Agent Wolfe?

40:16.422 --> 40:18.756
Don't you think the timing
of this was a little odd?

40:18.758 --> 40:21.325
Blake just happening to
show up in the morning?

40:21.327 --> 40:23.494
So, you think she planned this?

40:23.496 --> 40:26.497
Well, she knew Frank
wouldn't succeed by himself.

40:26.499 --> 40:28.265
And she made sure of that by not telling us

40:28.267 --> 40:30.300
about the inside man.

40:30.302 --> 40:31.702
So when Blake turned up,

40:31.704 --> 40:33.236
Frank would volunteer to take his place.

40:33.238 --> 40:35.072
She counted on it.

40:35.074 --> 40:36.073
I don't get it. Why?

40:36.075 --> 40:37.775
Why would she do that?

40:37.777 --> 40:39.943
You know all that "one life to give" stuff.

40:39.945 --> 40:42.079
She was really talking about herself.

40:42.081 --> 40:44.747
She and Blake were working
against the government.

40:44.749 --> 40:47.850
Okay, we just watched Agent Wolfe...

40:47.852 --> 40:49.852
She shot him, right in front of us.

40:49.854 --> 40:51.688
Yeah, well, she had to.

40:51.690 --> 40:53.456
To keep him from being questioned,

40:53.458 --> 40:55.625
or he would end up exposing her.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.260
Blake could never succeed.

40:57.262 --> 40:59.529
He would just end up being
arrested with the weapon

40:59.531 --> 41:03.265
and the investigation would
have fallen out of her hands.

41:03.267 --> 41:05.501
Shit, if you're right,
she's an evil genius.

41:05.503 --> 41:07.704
Yeah, and if Frank hands her that weapon,

41:07.706 --> 41:09.706
he'll just be giving it to the terrorists

41:09.708 --> 41:10.907
he's trying to stop.

41:13.476 --> 41:14.877
What's the matter, Mr. Blake?

41:16.080 --> 41:17.479
You forget your code?

41:18.815 --> 41:20.048
Turn around.

41:20.050 --> 41:21.983
What do you think this is? An ATM?

41:21.985 --> 41:23.919
You can't see the code. Turn around.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.139
You done?

41:46.442 --> 41:47.776
I'm done.

41:53.882 --> 41:55.216
Make good use of it.

41:55.218 --> 41:56.751
Shawn will see you out.

42:31.819 --> 42:33.620
You wrote this, didn't you?

42:34.722 --> 42:35.689
Who are you working for?

42:35.691 --> 42:36.690
Huh?

42:36.692 --> 42:37.691
Stop him!

42:37.693 --> 42:38.925
Stop him! Shawn, stop him!

42:41.595 --> 42:42.495
Stop him!

44:20.892 --> 44:22.392
Come into my place!

44:23.494 --> 44:24.995
Fuck you! You son-of-a-bitch!

44:39.443 --> 44:41.010
That was for my father.

44:53.156 --> 44:54.890
It's Frank, he's coming out!

44:58.494 --> 44:59.461
He's got the case.

45:07.570 --> 45:08.770
You got it, Frank.

45:13.443 --> 45:14.443
Where's the weapon?

45:14.445 --> 45:15.510
Destroyed,

45:15.512 --> 45:16.912
along with all the research to develop it.

45:18.681 --> 45:20.181
You got my message then?

45:20.183 --> 45:21.716
Yeah.

45:21.718 --> 45:22.584
What message?

45:24.186 --> 45:26.387
Did you think you would get away with it?

45:26.389 --> 45:27.422
Agent Wolfe,

45:27.424 --> 45:28.423
Cleef wasn't the mole.

45:28.425 --> 45:29.324
You are.

45:30.759 --> 45:32.327
"I have but one life to give"?

45:34.496 --> 45:36.097
You're with Blake.

45:36.099 --> 45:37.531
I'm a patriot.

45:37.533 --> 45:39.167
I've always done what's
best for my country.

45:39.169 --> 45:40.468
You're a nutjob.

45:40.470 --> 45:42.402
You won't be able to prove anything.

45:42.404 --> 45:43.637
Maybe they won't.

45:43.639 --> 45:45.840
But you were the only one who had access

45:45.842 --> 45:48.108
to my laptop last night.

45:48.110 --> 45:49.376
That I can prove.

45:51.913 --> 45:54.014
This country is in serious trouble.

45:54.016 --> 45:56.049
It's not going to get better
unless something is done.

45:56.051 --> 45:57.584
Like releasing a chemical weapon?

45:57.586 --> 45:58.685
Oh sweety.

45:58.687 --> 46:00.687
You have no idea the
damage you've done today.

46:00.689 --> 46:01.855
Oh, I think we do.

46:04.993 --> 46:07.094
Internal Affairs is waiting.

46:07.096 --> 46:08.862
We'll need your statement.

46:08.864 --> 46:10.364
I cannot thank you enough.

46:10.366 --> 46:11.264
You got it.

46:14.902 --> 46:17.136
Well that's not bad for a first day, Jules.

46:17.138 --> 46:18.605
Oh, thanks, you think?

46:21.241 --> 46:22.809
So...

46:22.811 --> 46:23.776
I can stay on then?

46:25.613 --> 46:26.513
What?

46:28.181 --> 46:29.148
Was that a "yes"?

46:29.150 --> 46:30.316
Or "maybe"?

46:32.419 --> 46:33.619
Get in the car.

46:33.621 --> 46:34.520
What... ?

46:36.423 --> 46:38.090
Okay.
