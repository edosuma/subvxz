- He threw me out of the car.

11:49.613 --> 11:50.745
It's gonna be okay.

11:50.747 --> 11:53.815
[crying] Thank you for saving me.

11:53.817 --> 11:56.385
It's okay.

11:59.456 --> 12:01.823
[sirens approaching]

12:01.825 --> 12:04.325
[woman continues sobbing]

12:05.796 --> 12:07.428
Got incoming.

12:07.430 --> 12:09.030
It's all right, sweetie, we got you.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.399
We got you. It's okay.

12:11.401 --> 12:13.434
We're staying right here with you, okay?

12:13.436 --> 12:14.602
We're going to Trauma 2.

12:14.604 --> 12:15.737
All right, Burgess, what happened?

12:15.739 --> 12:17.505
Kate Chen, hit repeatedly, choked out,

12:17.507 --> 12:19.373
lost consciousness twice...
that she remembers...

12:19.375 --> 12:20.641
And sexually assaulted.

12:20.643 --> 12:21.875
All right, we got this.

12:21.877 --> 12:23.644
- [sighs]
- [cell phone buzzing]

12:26.382 --> 12:30.017
Her Uber driver wasn't
pulled off to another job.

12:30.019 --> 12:31.586
Offender probably saw
her waiting for a ride

12:31.588 --> 12:33.621
and just bluffed her into his car.

12:33.623 --> 12:35.456
You know, the temporary
tags on the SUV...

12:35.458 --> 12:37.557
They weren't Illinois tags.

12:37.559 --> 12:38.959
Those were yellow placards,

12:38.961 --> 12:40.227
and they usually go on the rear bumper,

12:40.229 --> 12:42.930
which means the car was
purchased out of state

12:42.932 --> 12:44.164
or at an auction.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.933
- Right.
- Maybe something to go on.

12:45.935 --> 12:47.334
Yeah. Tay.

12:47.336 --> 12:48.602
You sure you're okay?

12:48.604 --> 12:50.303
Yeah, thanks.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.472
2113 Squad...

12:57.212 --> 12:58.911
[exhales sharply] Hey.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.817
How's everything going?

13:04.819 --> 13:06.119
Good.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.322
You can talk to me about anything.

13:10.324 --> 13:13.760
You know that, right?

13:13.762 --> 13:15.962
Yeah, I do.

13:15.964 --> 13:17.396
Thanks.

13:17.398 --> 13:20.299
<i>[ominous music]</i>

13:36.284 --> 13:38.450
Okay...

13:38.452 --> 13:41.253
where we at with the
wire this DOA was wearing?

13:41.255 --> 13:43.521
Tech lab confirmed
that it is CPD-issued.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.823
And no one's stepped forward to say

13:44.825 --> 13:45.924
they're working with this kid?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.859
No, no one yet.

13:47.861 --> 13:51.029
I want a full work-up on
the DOA's sister, Ally.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.831
Something was up with her at the house.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.033
- I agree.
- Okay, I'm on it.

13:55.035 --> 13:58.069
[cell phone buzzing]

14:08.548 --> 14:10.448
Okay, Ally Berner.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.017
Uh, looks like an Officer
Ricci out of Narcotics

14:13.019 --> 14:14.519
brought her in two weeks ago,

14:14.521 --> 14:16.020
but there's no record of any arrest.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.554
Must've been a catch-and-release.

14:17.556 --> 14:18.889
All right, let's get Ricci on the phone.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.524
- I'm on it.
- I'm stepping out for a bit.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.592
- Keep me posted.
- Hang on. Sarge.

14:22.594 --> 14:25.629
Commander Crowley's on
the 7447 line for you, sir.

14:30.069 --> 14:32.001
Take a message.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.706
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.208
All right, Ricci's out
on a buy with her team,

14:38.210 --> 14:41.545
so she's not gonna come up
for air until this afternoon.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.246
All right, let's take a ride.

14:43.248 --> 14:45.749
You know, that's the third
time that she's called

14:45.751 --> 14:48.184
for him today.

14:48.186 --> 14:51.687
Everybody just do your jobs, all right?

14:51.689 --> 14:54.690
<i>[tense music]</i>

15:03.501 --> 15:06.335
Hey, I'm sorry to have
to come back like this.

15:06.337 --> 15:08.270
No, you're not.

15:08.272 --> 15:10.806
Ally, we're sensing a little hostility

15:10.808 --> 15:12.941
between you and the
Chicago Police Department.

15:12.943 --> 15:14.777
What do you guys want?

15:14.779 --> 15:16.144
Well, we're wondering

15:16.146 --> 15:18.681
if maybe that has something to do with

15:18.683 --> 15:22.084
you and Officer Ricci from Narcotics.

15:22.086 --> 15:23.818
'Cause the only thing we know for sure

15:23.820 --> 15:27.589
is that your brother
was wearing a CPD wire,

15:27.591 --> 15:29.925
and you were brought in
two weeks ago by Ricci.

15:29.927 --> 15:31.726
Then why aren't you talking to her?

15:31.728 --> 15:33.996
We will.

15:33.998 --> 15:37.199
But I have a feeling
that we'll get the most...

15:37.201 --> 15:38.767
truthful version from you.

15:43.373 --> 15:46.474
Ally, help us find who
killed your brother.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.877
It's all right. It's okay.

15:48.879 --> 15:50.578
I don't know.

15:52.749 --> 15:56.718
But, um, Officer Ricci... She
arrested me for possession.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.220
I had some molly.

15:59.222 --> 16:02.823
I went to a concert, and
I got it from a friend.

16:02.825 --> 16:05.859
She told me that because I was
within 1,000 feet of a school,

16:05.861 --> 16:09.697
it was a Class X felony, and
I was gonna get ten years.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.433
She said that the only way that
I could avoid doing jail time

16:12.435 --> 16:14.200
was if I did a buy from a dealer

16:14.202 --> 16:15.436
she was trying to bust.

16:15.438 --> 16:17.805
I freaked. I didn't know what to do.

16:19.975 --> 16:23.611
So I told Evan, because we're close.

16:24.313 --> 16:27.880
He said that he would do it for
me so I could stay out of it.

16:27.882 --> 16:31.719
He talked to Officer
Ricci, and she said...

16:32.421 --> 16:34.421
She said that she
didn't care who did it,

16:34.423 --> 16:36.789
but if it didn't get
done, I was going to jail.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.358
And the next thing I heard,

16:38.360 --> 16:40.293
he was found burned
to death in that car.

16:43.332 --> 16:44.730
Man.

16:44.732 --> 16:47.633
That's why I didn't come forward sooner.

16:47.635 --> 16:49.702
I don't know who I can trust.

16:58.212 --> 17:00.112
- Officer Ricci?
- Yeah?

17:00.114 --> 17:02.047
Detectives Halstead and Lindsay.

17:02.049 --> 17:03.215
Intelligence.

17:03.217 --> 17:04.549
Evan Berner.

17:04.550 --> 17:05.617
What about him?

17:05.618 --> 17:06.751
You tell us.

17:06.752 --> 17:08.887
Uh, he was working a case for me.

17:08.888 --> 17:10.589
He got cold feet; he took off.

17:10.590 --> 17:14.425
He was found torched
in his car yesterday.

17:14.428 --> 17:15.994
Are you messing with me right now?

17:15.997 --> 17:17.796
No.

17:17.798 --> 17:19.130
You have anybody in custody?

17:19.132 --> 17:20.531
No, we don't.

17:20.534 --> 17:22.400
Oh, my God.

17:22.402 --> 17:25.971
Uh, we went on a buy.

17:25.973 --> 17:27.539
Evan went mobile with the target,

17:27.540 --> 17:28.673
which he wasn't supposed to do,

17:28.675 --> 17:30.108
but I just figured he boogied.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.844
Happens all the time.
You guys know that.

17:32.846 --> 17:34.612
Tried calling him couple times.

17:34.614 --> 17:37.615
No dice, so I was just waiting
for him to come forward.

17:37.617 --> 17:39.517
I think you're lying to cover your ass.

17:39.519 --> 17:42.053
What?

17:42.055 --> 17:43.121
Huh.

17:43.123 --> 17:44.955
Who the hell are you
to talk to me like that?

17:44.957 --> 17:47.392
You let his sister think
she was looking at ten years

17:47.394 --> 17:49.693
and a felony charge on a dime bag.

17:49.695 --> 17:51.361
And you let Evan step into her shoes.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.697
I'm gonna talk to you however
the hell I want to talk to you.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.432
You flip the minnows
to get to the sharks.

17:55.434 --> 17:57.100
Do you even know how Narcotics works?

17:57.102 --> 17:58.569
- Actually, I do.
- Yeah?

17:58.571 --> 18:00.070
So where's your pre-raid
plan? I'd like to see it.

18:00.072 --> 18:01.639
And I'd like to know
who was on your team.

18:01.641 --> 18:03.707
Uh, my team got called into court

18:03.709 --> 18:05.242
at the last minute.

18:05.244 --> 18:07.777
That's why it was just me and
Mike Kendricks, my partner.

18:07.779 --> 18:10.447
Interesting. What about
the 1505 buy money?

18:10.449 --> 18:12.315
Where is it? Who signed it out?

18:12.317 --> 18:14.784
And who wired Evan up?
They did a crap job.

18:14.786 --> 18:16.386
- All right. All right.
- Okay, okay.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.455
Let's, uh...

18:18.457 --> 18:20.690
start over, okay?

18:20.692 --> 18:22.392
We're all on the same team here, right?

18:22.394 --> 18:24.961
Maybe I cut a couple corners, okay?

18:24.963 --> 18:27.163
Look, I'm just trying to get my arrest

18:27.165 --> 18:29.032
and my activity rate up, okay?

18:29.034 --> 18:30.934
Who was the target? Let's start there.

18:33.271 --> 18:34.571
Connor Wix.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.172
He's a big MDMA dealer.

18:36.174 --> 18:38.675
Ex-Marine. Owns a gym in Bucktown.

18:38.677 --> 18:41.043
He's a piece of work, this guy.

18:41.045 --> 18:42.978
And this is who got into
Evan's car before you lost him?

18:42.980 --> 18:44.346
Yeah, that's right.

18:44.348 --> 18:45.681
Okay.

18:48.052 --> 18:50.586
You know, I'll bet you knew
Evan got killed yesterday,

18:50.588 --> 18:54.556
and you were just hoping no one
connected the dots back to you.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.692
You work for Hank
Voight in Intelligence,

18:56.694 --> 18:59.861
and you're lecturing me?

18:59.863 --> 19:02.130
Save it.

19:11.141 --> 19:12.273
Olive?

19:12.275 --> 19:14.942
- [baby babbling]
- Hey.

19:14.944 --> 19:17.812
You going somewhere?

19:17.814 --> 19:20.181
[chuckles]

19:20.183 --> 19:24.119
To Scottsdale, where my sister is.

19:25.222 --> 19:29.056
For how long?

19:29.058 --> 19:31.092
I'm moving there, Hank.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.161
Olive...

19:34.163 --> 19:36.697
There's too many bad
memories around here.

19:36.699 --> 19:38.666
Everywhere I look, I either see Justin,

19:38.668 --> 19:40.001
or I see what killed him.

19:40.003 --> 19:43.738
Olive, please don't do this...

19:43.740 --> 19:45.339
Not right now.

19:45.341 --> 19:47.374
Just, please...

19:47.376 --> 19:50.244
I can't stay here.

19:50.246 --> 19:52.679
I'm sorry.

19:52.681 --> 19:55.449
[car horn honking]

19:55.451 --> 19:56.850
That's my ride.

[baby wailing]

20:19.479 --> 20:21.914
Hey, I tried you last night.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.416
Yeah.

20:27.955 --> 20:30.822
I feel a little, um...

20:30.824 --> 20:34.493
Handcuffed here, because
I want to be there for you.

20:34.995 --> 20:38.163
But I don't know what
you're going through.

20:49.543 --> 20:52.544
Crowley thinks I know about Voight

20:52.546 --> 20:55.346
and that guy who killed Justin.

20:55.348 --> 20:58.683
Do you?

20:58.685 --> 21:01.352
I know enough.

21:01.354 --> 21:04.555
Now every step I take, I feel
like it could be a trapdoor.

21:06.559 --> 21:08.359
Those are meant for Voight.

21:08.361 --> 21:10.961
Do not go down with him, please.

21:13.999 --> 21:16.534
It's already in motion.

21:16.536 --> 21:19.803
I just got to let it play out.

21:19.805 --> 21:21.672
Hey, there's one thing you can do.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.679
Move in with me.

21:28.681 --> 21:30.380
Cases come and go.

21:30.382 --> 21:32.382
Bosses come and go. Jobs come and go.

21:32.384 --> 21:34.350
I don't want you to come and go.

21:57.709 --> 21:59.274
Is this Wix?

22:01.178 --> 22:03.079
Yeah, that's him.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.182

22:09.086 --> 22:10.319
- [camera shutter clicking]
- Mm-hmm.

22:10.321 --> 22:12.488
- Triggerfish him.
- I want that number.

22:12.490 --> 22:13.788
Okay.

22:20.797 --> 22:23.732
Come on, call somebody, you nitwit.

22:23.734 --> 22:26.001
Hey, Antonio, headquarters called me,

22:26.003 --> 22:28.302
asked me to come in
and talk about the night

22:28.304 --> 22:29.470
Justin Voight got killed.

22:29.472 --> 22:31.472
Have your FOP lawyer handle it.

22:31.474 --> 22:33.074
Handle it?

22:33.076 --> 22:34.475
I mean, there's nothing to handle.

22:34.477 --> 22:36.277
- I don't... I don't know anything.
- Well, good.

22:36.279 --> 22:37.879
Either way, you don't talk to them

22:37.881 --> 22:39.948
unless your lawyer's present.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.215
Okay.

22:41.217 --> 22:42.683
But if I bring in a lawyer,

22:42.685 --> 22:44.418
doesn't that look like
I'm guilty of something?

22:44.420 --> 22:46.187
You asking me for my advice
or just to let me know

22:46.189 --> 22:47.455
headquarters reached out to you?

22:47.457 --> 22:49.323
Advice.

22:49.325 --> 22:51.091
Then let your FOP lawyer handle it,

22:51.093 --> 22:53.961
and let's not talk about it again.

22:53.963 --> 22:55.029
I can do that.

22:58.267 --> 22:59.767
[camera shutter clicking]

22:59.769 --> 23:03.470
All right, here we go.

23:03.472 --> 23:04.772
- [device beeps]
- All right.

23:06.709 --> 23:08.042
We got it.

23:08.044 --> 23:09.543
Call that number in to Lindsay.

23:09.545 --> 23:11.178
We need warrant for all
the the muds and tolls

23:11.180 --> 23:12.179
off that phone.

23:12.181 --> 23:13.846
Yup.

23:17.118 --> 23:18.585
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

23:21.122 --> 23:23.856
Father of the DOA, Ted Berner.

23:23.858 --> 23:27.360
He just got here. He's
got some questions.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.362
You know,

23:29.364 --> 23:32.965
you could've taken longer to come back.

23:32.967 --> 23:35.668
A lot of things I could've
done different, Trudy.

23:42.077 --> 23:43.242
Mr. Berner?

23:43.244 --> 23:44.944
So... [sniffs]

23:44.946 --> 23:46.878
I'm hearing from my daughter

23:46.880 --> 23:49.848
that a cop may have
pushed Evan into this?

23:49.850 --> 23:51.049
We're looking into that.

23:51.051 --> 23:52.218
Yes or no?

23:52.220 --> 23:54.553
Yes.

23:54.555 --> 23:56.121
I tried calling her... Ricci?

23:56.123 --> 23:57.323
That's her name?

23:57.325 --> 23:58.790
She won't call me back.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.259
Now's not the right time.

24:00.261 --> 24:02.661
She got my son killed!

24:04.631 --> 24:06.331
I understand what
you're feeling right now.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.333
You don't understand a damn thing

24:08.335 --> 24:10.235
I'm feeling right now!

24:10.237 --> 24:12.037
Mr. Berner, do you want an investigation

24:12.039 --> 24:13.238
as to what went wrong,

24:13.240 --> 24:15.240
or do you want to find the
man who killed your son?

24:15.242 --> 24:16.641
[breathing heavily]

24:16.643 --> 24:20.010
I want to find the
man that killed my son.

24:20.012 --> 24:23.748
I'm gonna do that.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.850
Right now, everyone
involved in this case

24:25.852 --> 24:27.818
needs to keep a real low profile.

24:27.820 --> 24:29.086
You got to trust me on this.

24:29.088 --> 24:31.122
[crying softly]

24:33.426 --> 24:35.660
[sniffles]

24:35.662 --> 24:39.497
They took 60 years of
living away from him.

24:40.299 --> 24:43.302
Falling in love, getting married,

24:44.804 --> 24:47.404
holding his child in his arms...

24:47.406 --> 24:48.572
[sniffles]

25:06.592 --> 25:07.824
Any updates?

25:07.826 --> 25:09.525
No, but they've got an all-call message

25:09.527 --> 25:11.360
going every half hour over the zone.

25:11.362 --> 25:14.063
The offender's still out
there. Car's not been recovered.

25:20.038 --> 25:21.404
Last time I fired my service weapon,

25:21.406 --> 25:23.406
I got dragged into court.

25:23.408 --> 25:26.542
Almost lost my job.

25:26.544 --> 25:28.444
I maybe hesitated a
little back on the street.

25:28.446 --> 25:31.146
I may have had the shot on that guy.

25:31.148 --> 25:32.581
That won't happen again.

25:32.583 --> 25:34.717
Everything was happening so fast.

25:34.719 --> 25:36.352
And there was a civilian there,

25:36.354 --> 25:38.487
so you made the right call not to fire.

25:40.858 --> 25:43.725
- I'm glad you're my partner.
- Me too.

25:43.727 --> 25:45.260
[chuckles]

25:45.262 --> 25:46.494
Pfff.

25:46.496 --> 25:48.797
We'll just see how long it lasts.

25:48.799 --> 25:49.998
How do you mean?

25:53.070 --> 25:55.537
Two years ago, I was
working at the 24th.

25:55.539 --> 25:56.538
Okay.

25:56.540 --> 25:58.406
And there was... is...

25:58.408 --> 25:59.974
a Commander Fogel.

25:59.976 --> 26:03.010
I ran into him at a bar after hours.

26:03.012 --> 26:05.112
He seemed very nice.
Walked me to my car.

26:05.114 --> 26:07.449
And then he tried to kiss me.

26:07.451 --> 26:10.552
I pushed him off. Didn't report him.

26:10.554 --> 26:13.254
I should've, because the next day,

26:13.256 --> 26:14.656
he put a brick on me,

26:14.658 --> 26:18.460
and that's how I ended up
writing tickets at 26th and Cal.

26:18.962 --> 26:20.328
He assigned you there?

26:20.330 --> 26:22.563
Yeah.

26:22.565 --> 26:23.965
And then I met Sergeant Platt

26:23.967 --> 26:26.367
at a Women's Police Association lunch,

26:26.369 --> 26:29.036
and she offered to help me out.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.375
What?

26:36.011 --> 26:38.612
There was a decal on the
back window of the SUV...

26:38.614 --> 26:40.381
A White Sox parking sticker,

26:40.383 --> 26:43.684
for residents living near the ballpark.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.720
I think that can help us narrow
down where the SUV came from.

26:49.258 --> 26:50.757
All right, according
to the phone records,

26:50.759 --> 26:52.592
Wix had these four
women working for him...

26:52.594 --> 26:54.060
Probably his couriers.

26:54.062 --> 26:56.062
Three of them are strippers,
for whatever that's worth,

26:56.064 --> 26:57.730
but one of 'em stood out...

26:57.732 --> 26:58.899
Nikki Culler.

26:58.901 --> 27:01.268
Looks like she did
some smurfing for Wix.

27:01.270 --> 27:03.569
Hit multiple currency exchanges,

27:03.571 --> 27:05.337
but kept everything under 3K

27:05.339 --> 27:08.541
so as not to elicit a
Suspicious Activity Report.

27:08.543 --> 27:11.310
The thing is, she did it so many times,

27:11.312 --> 27:12.845
she got reported anyway.

27:12.847 --> 27:15.648
Where's Lindsay?

27:15.650 --> 27:17.550
She's working the case.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.853
Ah, here we go.

27:21.855 --> 27:24.290
Wix and Nikki have a
three-year-old son together.

27:24.292 --> 27:26.058
Child Services has
been to their apartment

27:26.060 --> 27:27.960
three times over the past two years.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.869
Where's Ryder?

27:37.871 --> 27:39.738
- With a police officer in...
- What?

27:43.176 --> 27:45.176
Ryder? Come here, sweetie.

27:45.178 --> 27:47.746
- Mommy.
- Hey. Hey.

27:47.748 --> 27:49.314
[exhales]

27:49.316 --> 27:51.450
He's a cute kid.

27:51.452 --> 27:54.452
You ever want to see him again?

27:54.454 --> 27:57.455
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

28:39.153 --> 28:41.488
So these are copies

28:41.490 --> 28:43.756
of what I submitted to the Ivory Tower.

28:43.758 --> 28:46.659
My NPR and a To-From to my commander

28:46.661 --> 28:47.760
and a closing report.

28:47.762 --> 28:49.029
It lays out what I did...

28:49.031 --> 28:50.430
And what I didn't do.

28:50.432 --> 28:53.666
And it's not just to cover my ass.

28:56.171 --> 28:59.438
I just feel responsible for
what happened to Evan Berner.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.873
I can't make it right,

29:00.875 --> 29:03.442
but I can face up to it.

29:05.980 --> 29:07.847
Good luck, Officer.

29:07.849 --> 29:11.417
Sometimes you get caught up in the job,

29:12.119 --> 29:13.853
and you forget the real reasons

29:13.855 --> 29:16.255
why you started doing it to begin with.

29:30.971 --> 29:32.403
Okay, so we're looking for a nexus

29:32.405 --> 29:34.005
between out-of-state temp tags

29:34.007 --> 29:36.340
and White Sox residential
parking stickers.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.209
Yeah, also check for any
registered sex offenders

29:38.211 --> 29:40.178
in that district and the
surrounding districts.

29:40.180 --> 29:41.412
Okay.

29:41.414 --> 29:44.215
Hey, turns out writing
all those parking tickets

29:44.217 --> 29:45.550
at the courthouse finally paid off.

29:45.552 --> 29:47.351
[chuckles] Yeah, let's hope.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.626
Look for body shops in the neighborhood.

29:55.628 --> 29:56.994
If the offender's from there,

29:56.996 --> 29:58.629
he's gonna be looking
to get the windows fixed.

29:58.631 --> 30:01.532
Oh. Girl's still got it. [laughs]

30:01.534 --> 30:03.534
Wow.

30:16.616 --> 30:17.881
- Officers.
- How's it going?

30:17.883 --> 30:18.983
Your name?

30:18.985 --> 30:19.984
Oscar Flynn.

30:19.986 --> 30:20.984
You the owner?

30:20.986 --> 30:22.185
That's right.

30:22.187 --> 30:23.786
Okay, we're looking for a black SUV...

30:23.788 --> 30:24.821
Out-of-state temp tags.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.089
Would've come in in the last day or so

30:26.091 --> 30:27.324
to get his window fixed.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.858
- I've seen him.
- When?

30:28.860 --> 30:30.293
Came in earlier today.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.195
I told him I couldn't
get it done till tomorrow.

30:32.197 --> 30:35.465
He offered me double, and I told
him he could offer me quadruple,

30:35.467 --> 30:37.734
but I wasn't gonna get the
parts here till tomorrow.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.769
Sent him to Pinky's over on Roosevelt.

30:39.771 --> 30:40.770
He took off.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.338
You got security cameras out here?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.606
Only out back.

30:48.379 --> 30:51.413
- Kim.
- Put your hands on the hood.

30:51.415 --> 30:52.949
Whose car is that?

30:52.951 --> 30:54.216
You say nothing, it's yours,

30:54.218 --> 30:56.018
and then you go down
for kidnapping and rape.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.121
You like that? Give me a name.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.124
Police! Freeze!

31:02.126 --> 31:03.526
I will not hesitate!

31:09.233 --> 31:10.298
[grunts]

31:19.143 --> 31:21.643
I just feel like I'm being worked here.

31:21.645 --> 31:23.845
You're shacking up with a drug dealer

31:23.847 --> 31:25.147
who killed someone.

31:25.149 --> 31:27.915
You're totally aware what
he does for a living, right?

31:27.917 --> 31:30.151
And you've helped him launder money.

31:30.153 --> 31:33.154
I don't know everything.

31:33.156 --> 31:36.123
I didn't know that he killed that kid.

31:36.125 --> 31:38.560
Exactly, and that's the only thing

31:38.562 --> 31:40.728
that's gonna keep you out
of jail and with your son.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.263
But you got to help us bring Wix down...

31:43.265 --> 31:44.431
Period.

31:48.671 --> 31:49.804
[sighs]

31:49.806 --> 31:51.505
Okay, so located on your purse strap

31:51.507 --> 31:53.074
is a tiny, undetectable camera.

31:53.076 --> 31:54.308
- We can see everything.
- Okay.

31:54.310 --> 31:55.710
Right in here is the transponder.

31:55.712 --> 31:56.911
You don't need to do anything.

31:56.913 --> 31:58.412
Just keep that in your purse.

31:58.414 --> 32:00.347
I don't need to activate it or anything?

32:00.349 --> 32:03.350
One more time: you don't
need to do anything.

32:03.352 --> 32:04.851
Detective Olinsky's your ghost.

32:04.853 --> 32:06.920
He'll be nearby with an
eye on you at all times

32:06.922 --> 32:08.121
ready to move in if needed.

32:08.123 --> 32:09.656
Do not make eye contact with him.

32:09.658 --> 32:10.957
Well, how close?

32:10.959 --> 32:12.526
I'll be close enough. Don't worry.

32:12.528 --> 32:14.228
Look, if you're afraid for any reason,

32:14.230 --> 32:15.696
take off your ponytail holder.

32:15.698 --> 32:18.098
That's your visual
distress signal, okay?

32:18.100 --> 32:20.299
Your verbal cue is "crazy."

32:20.301 --> 32:21.500
That's all you got to say...

32:21.502 --> 32:23.369
Like, "Hey, this is crazy," all right?

32:23.371 --> 32:25.805
One of those cues or
both, we're coming in.

32:25.807 --> 32:27.273
I... I wouldn't say, "This is crazy."

32:27.275 --> 32:29.709
I would say, "This is bananas."

32:29.711 --> 32:32.178
Okay, "bananas." That's all right.

32:32.180 --> 32:34.647
Everybody hear that? New safe word.

32:34.649 --> 32:35.914
It's bananas.

32:35.916 --> 32:37.750
I'm freaking out a
little bit here, okay?

32:37.752 --> 32:39.652
Hey, hey, hey. This is what we do.

32:39.654 --> 32:41.420
And we do it better than anybody.

32:41.422 --> 32:43.188
If anything looks like
it's going sideways,

32:43.190 --> 32:44.690
we'll move in.

32:44.692 --> 32:46.259
There's nothing in this world
worth you getting hurt over.

32:46.261 --> 32:47.560
We have your back.

32:47.562 --> 32:48.927
He doesn't.

32:51.331 --> 32:52.998
Your boyfriend shot a kid in the head

32:53.000 --> 32:54.399
and then lit him on fire.

32:54.401 --> 32:56.301
Sorry if I'm not in a
hand-holding mood right now.

32:56.303 --> 32:57.803
I had nothing to do with that!

32:57.805 --> 32:58.971
You're gonna be fine, Nikki.

32:58.973 --> 33:00.305
Just stick to the plan.

33:00.307 --> 33:01.573
Let's roll out.

33:08.948 --> 33:11.082
Why you calling me on my personal phone?

33:11.084 --> 33:12.917
I saw the news, Connor.

33:12.919 --> 33:14.886
- Good for you.
- I never agreed to this.

33:14.888 --> 33:18.089
- To what?
- Burned alive?

33:18.091 --> 33:20.425
If it makes any difference, Nikki,

33:20.427 --> 33:22.626
he was dead before the car was torched.

33:22.628 --> 33:24.495
<i>What happened to you?</i>

33:24.497 --> 33:26.164
<i>You're sick.</i>

33:26.166 --> 33:27.832
<i>He was a snitch working with the cops.</i>

33:27.834 --> 33:29.100
[cell phone buzzing]

33:29.102 --> 33:30.459
<i>He was trying to put us in jail, Nikki.</i>

33:30.460 --> 33:32.103
- _
- <i>Does that matter to you?</i>

33:32.105 --> 33:33.237
<i>- That's what he said?
- No.</i>

33:33.239 --> 33:34.405
<i>"I'm working with the cops."</i>

33:34.407 --> 33:35.406
<i>That's what he said?</i>

33:35.408 --> 33:36.507
<i>It was a hunch I got,</i>

33:36.509 --> 33:37.775
<i>and I pressed him on it,</i>

33:37.777 --> 33:39.376
<i>and he didn't have the right answers.</i>

33:39.378 --> 33:41.545
He made his choice. I made mine.

33:41.547 --> 33:43.781
Okay?

33:43.783 --> 33:45.949
So you killed him?

33:45.951 --> 33:49.119
Why are you asking so many questions?

33:49.121 --> 33:50.954
- Bitch!
- Move in.

34:14.679 --> 34:15.745
[tires screech]

34:15.746 --> 34:16.779
[engine revving]

34:26.891 --> 34:28.790
Got him.

34:28.792 --> 34:30.292
Don't move!

34:50.848 --> 34:51.913
Commander.

34:51.915 --> 34:54.081
Would you come with us, Sergeant?

34:54.083 --> 34:57.085
<i>[tense music]</i>

35:02.125 --> 35:03.524
Your gun, please.

35:50.819 --> 35:52.786
At this point, we
have a pretty good idea

35:52.788 --> 35:54.288
what happened the night
your son was killed.

35:54.290 --> 35:56.190
Is that right?

35:56.192 --> 35:59.660
Your brought the suspect,
Kevin Bingham, here...

35:59.662 --> 36:01.295
and he never left.

36:03.499 --> 36:05.299
We pinged your car to this location.

36:05.301 --> 36:06.934
Look familiar?

36:11.306 --> 36:14.174
Hank, you know how this works.

36:14.176 --> 36:16.977
Save us the trouble of
having to dig up his body,

36:16.979 --> 36:19.213
and we cut you a deal.

36:19.215 --> 36:22.082
<i>[dark music]</i>

36:26.955 --> 36:29.723
You got a kid, Commander?

36:29.725 --> 36:31.691
No?

36:34.263 --> 36:36.263
Well, if you did, and
you held him in your arms

36:36.265 --> 36:40.133
with blood coming out of his
head from a gunshot wound,

36:40.135 --> 36:42.534
we wouldn't be standing here right now.

36:46.841 --> 36:48.841
Dig it up.

36:54.849 --> 36:58.551
You have to make so many death
notifications on this job.

36:59.253 --> 37:01.654
I remember every one.

37:01.656 --> 37:04.323
Now to be able to walk
up to someone's door,

37:04.325 --> 37:06.525
someone who's lost so much,

37:06.527 --> 37:08.927
and bring good news...

37:10.097 --> 37:11.229
It's a blessing.

37:11.231 --> 37:12.564
I hear you.

37:13.867 --> 37:15.433
Kate?

37:18.105 --> 37:20.605
Are any of these men the
person that did this to you?

37:23.277 --> 37:24.676
That's him.

37:24.678 --> 37:27.645
Are you going to arrest him now?

37:27.647 --> 37:30.481
We already got his ass.

37:30.483 --> 37:31.716
[cries]

37:39.292 --> 37:40.792
Thank you.

37:40.794 --> 37:41.926
Of course.

37:42.895 --> 37:44.128
Thank you.

37:49.202 --> 37:52.937
[low conversation]

37:57.944 --> 38:00.344
Commander.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.079
Commander.

38:02.081 --> 38:04.914
Heard you were detailed at the 21st.

38:04.916 --> 38:08.251
That's correct.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.286
Good luck.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.194
Tay?

38:35.847 --> 38:38.113
Congratulations.

38:38.115 --> 38:40.349
Can I get back to work now?

38:45.055 --> 38:47.189
He's cleared.

39:09.913 --> 39:11.946
[buzzing]

39:14.183 --> 39:15.850
[knocking at door]

39:48.517 --> 39:49.716
Thank you.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.962
You saved my life.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.630
I would've been dead at 15
if you hadn't taken me in.

40:04.632 --> 40:08.034
There's... no doubt
in my mind about that.

40:10.038 --> 40:13.106
And I've always looked
forward to saving yours.

40:38.466 --> 40:40.599
You're all I have left now.
