<b>DAYLIGHT'S END</b>

03:57.243 --> 04:00.243
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

10:51.015 --> 10:52.117
Shit!

11:28.553 --> 11:34.092
# Momma's gonna buy you
a mockingbird #

11:40.564 --> 11:46.737
# Momma's gonna buy you
a diamond ring #

11:46.771 --> 11:52.243
# And if that diamond ring
turns brass #

11:56.713 --> 11:58.717
# Looking glass #

12:00.217 --> 12:03.855
# And if that looking glass
gets broke #

12:03.887 --> 12:06.891
Mike, be careful.

12:06.924 --> 12:10.629
# Mama's gonna buy you
a Billy goat #

12:16.099 --> 12:17.801
Ma'am, are you okay?

12:17.834 --> 12:21.006
# Mama's gonna buy you
a mockingbird #

12:27.078 --> 12:29.047
Are you all right, ma'am?

12:29.079 --> 12:34.919
# Gonna buy you a diamond ring #

12:34.952 --> 12:36.821
Ma'am?

12:58.909 --> 13:00.145
Cover!

13:28.705 --> 13:30.175
Comin' around!

13:48.825 --> 13:50.728
Don't move, bitch.

14:15.019 --> 14:19.057
Look, take the car. Just take
whatever you want, okay?

14:19.089 --> 14:21.124
Well, that's the idea, baby.

14:21.157 --> 14:24.161
What's wrong with you?
Those things are the enemy.

14:24.194 --> 14:25.862
We're all supposed
to be on the same side.

14:25.896 --> 14:30.068
There ain't no fuckin'
sides no more.

14:30.101 --> 14:36.708
Supplies, everything's so hard
to come by these days.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.042
Everything.

14:38.074 --> 14:39.476
Fuck you.

14:39.477 --> 14:40.877
Nice.

14:40.910 --> 14:43.280
Glad we got her permission.

14:49.285 --> 14:52.056
We been watchin' you,
young lady.

14:55.226 --> 14:56.294
You made us hungry.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.763
Fuck!

16:22.146 --> 16:27.352
You... you killed
my fuckin' men!

16:29.118 --> 16:30.988
Hey, what do you want?

16:33.357 --> 16:36.059
You want guns? You want ammo?

16:36.093 --> 16:38.429
Take... take it. Take whatever
the fuck you want.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.837
No, no, no, no don't, don't,
don't, don't.

16:45.870 --> 16:47.338
Where you from?

16:47.371 --> 16:50.473
Aus... Austin. Came from
f-fuckin' Austin.

16:50.506 --> 16:52.476
You got more of those things
there?

16:52.508 --> 16:54.578
There's fuckin' all kinds
of those fuckin' things...

16:54.612 --> 16:55.913
everywhere, man.

16:55.945 --> 16:57.381
What the fuck do you think?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.454
She with you?

17:05.489 --> 17:10.428
Yeah, found her wanderin' in the
woods, 'bout five days back.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.463
Thought we could use her.

17:14.598 --> 17:18.101
But we've been... we've been
takin' care of her, good care.

17:18.135 --> 17:20.104
I swear.

17:20.136 --> 17:21.606
Like she was one of our own.

17:21.637 --> 17:23.607
Where you goin'?

17:23.640 --> 17:27.243
You can't fuckin' leave me
out here, man!

17:27.278 --> 17:29.213
Not with the night comin'!

17:40.357 --> 17:44.628
I'm just tryin' to survive
just like you!

17:44.662 --> 17:46.998
Wait! You fucking bitch!

17:47.030 --> 17:50.634
Fuck! God!

17:54.504 --> 17:56.506
Hey.

17:58.008 --> 17:59.978
Hello?

18:01.145 --> 18:02.946
Hi.

18:02.980 --> 18:08.319
Isn't he the most beautiful baby
boy you've ever seen?

18:08.351 --> 18:12.089
Yeah. What's his name?

18:13.624 --> 18:18.296
Jacob. Jacob Wallace, Jr.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.267
And what's your name?

18:26.169 --> 18:27.571
Annabelle.

18:28.739 --> 18:31.342
Okay, Annabelle.

18:31.375 --> 18:34.011
Well, we need to get out
of here, okay?

18:45.556 --> 18:49.260
All right, come on.
Come with me. Upsy-daisy.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.933
Yep, you come with me.

19:04.508 --> 19:07.946
Hey! Hey, wait up.

19:09.579 --> 19:10.647
Where you goin'?

19:10.681 --> 19:12.283
Just goin'.

19:12.316 --> 19:13.617
You can't leave us out here.

19:13.649 --> 19:15.185
We won't last the night.

19:15.219 --> 19:16.988
Plus, you're gonna wanna be
somewhere safe...

19:17.021 --> 19:18.388
when it gets dark.

19:18.422 --> 19:20.257
Nowhere's safe.

19:20.290 --> 19:23.527
I'm with a group of survivors.
A lot of them used to be cops.

19:23.559 --> 19:26.364
We have guns, ammunition,
food, water.

19:26.396 --> 19:27.999
We even have electricity.

19:28.031 --> 19:29.633
Listen, if you take us there...

19:29.665 --> 19:33.136
I promise you a safe place for
the night, plus as much food...

19:33.169 --> 19:35.639
ammo and gas as you can
carry tomorrow.

19:38.509 --> 19:40.478
- Where is it?
- Dallas.

19:40.511 --> 19:42.245
It's less than an hour
and a half.

19:43.713 --> 19:47.283
Those things, there more
of 'em there?

19:47.317 --> 19:51.189
They've been hittin' us every
night, but we've held 'em off.

19:56.059 --> 19:57.461
Let's go.

19:57.493 --> 19:59.097
Come on.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.608
I'm Sam.

20:11.642 --> 20:15.513
It's short for Samantha, but
everybody just calls me Sam.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.815
Rourke.

20:17.848 --> 20:20.585
Is that your first name
or your last?

20:26.089 --> 20:28.525
He's so beautiful.

20:30.293 --> 20:32.229
What do you think's wrong
with her?

20:34.130 --> 20:36.266
Where would you start?

20:36.300 --> 20:37.667
Are you okay?

20:42.271 --> 20:44.308
Look, I know I didn't say
it back there...

20:44.340 --> 20:47.343
but thanks for what you did.

20:47.376 --> 20:50.313
You don't meet a lot of good
people these days.

20:50.347 --> 20:53.751
What makes you think
I'm good people?

21:06.829 --> 21:08.732
I need to know where to go.

21:08.764 --> 21:09.867
We're not gonna make it.

21:09.899 --> 21:11.868
Come on, which way!

21:11.902 --> 21:13.771
Exit right up here.

21:21.712 --> 21:22.814
There, take a left.

21:27.550 --> 21:28.551
Shit!

21:28.585 --> 21:30.555
This is a bad idea.

21:33.223 --> 21:35.425
Ethan, it's Sam. Open the door.
We're comin' in.

21:42.331 --> 21:44.868
<i>SAM
Ethan, it's Sam. Do you copy?</i>

21:44.902 --> 21:46.904
Sam, what's goin' on?
Where are you?

21:46.936 --> 21:48.705
<i>SAM We're a block
from Commerce Street.</i>

21:48.739 --> 21:50.708
<i>They're everywhere.
We need you to be ready for us.</i>

21:50.741 --> 21:51.843
Shit.

21:54.411 --> 21:55.846
Chris?

21:55.878 --> 21:57.581
Is it Mike?

21:59.415 --> 22:04.554
Okay, c'mon, let's go. Let's go!

22:04.588 --> 22:08.759
"I made myself a wooden heart
to sail the blood red sea."

22:08.791 --> 22:13.230
Incoming! Move!
And I mean, move!

22:13.262 --> 22:15.331
Dad, the scouts are comin'
in hot!

22:15.365 --> 22:16.867
Lock 'em down, now!

22:16.899 --> 22:18.401
All right, kids, let's go.
You know the drill.

22:18.434 --> 22:20.471
Double time, let's go!

22:25.675 --> 22:26.944
Goddamn it, Ethan,
open the door!

22:26.976 --> 22:28.878
We're gonna be there in seconds!

22:28.912 --> 22:32.583
We're headin' down to the garage
right now, Sam. Aim for it.

22:32.616 --> 22:35.485
Okay, people, you know the
drill, swift, but safe!

22:36.986 --> 22:38.655
Watch your step. Go.

22:38.688 --> 22:39.956
I love you, babe.
Go, go, go, go, go.

22:39.990 --> 22:41.425
Lock it up.

22:41.457 --> 22:44.227
Go, we gotta get to the garage!

22:44.261 --> 22:45.328
Go!

22:49.832 --> 22:51.801
Let's go! Let's go!
Stack it up on me!

22:51.835 --> 22:53.120
Check your weapons!

22:53.121 --> 22:54.405
Check your weapons!

22:54.437 --> 22:55.588
Good!

22:55.589 --> 22:56.739
Hit it!

22:56.772 --> 22:58.242
Go!

23:13.257 --> 23:15.326
Which way? Come on!

23:15.358 --> 23:16.526
Turn left. There it is.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.835
They're coming.

23:24.867 --> 23:26.436
Yeah, no shit.

23:33.476 --> 23:35.412
Come on. Come on.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.583
Run!

24:04.640 --> 24:05.792
Sam, move it!

24:05.793 --> 24:06.944
Come on!

24:12.816 --> 24:14.785
Fall back!

24:20.589 --> 24:21.724
Moving!

24:21.725 --> 24:22.859
Covering!

24:27.330 --> 24:28.431
Bishop!

24:28.432 --> 24:29.532
Moving!

24:39.710 --> 24:41.612
Sam! Go, go!

24:43.879 --> 24:44.965
Moving!

24:44.966 --> 24:46.050
Covering!

24:51.855 --> 24:52.957
Bishop, come on!

24:52.958 --> 24:54.058
Moving!

24:57.094 --> 24:59.997
Move! Move! Move!

25:00.030 --> 25:04.835
Come on, the door's closing!

25:04.867 --> 25:06.503
I'm closing the fucking door!

25:19.415 --> 25:20.617
No!

25:30.993 --> 25:32.562
Let's go!

25:34.731 --> 25:36.099
Fuck!

25:41.070 --> 25:42.939
- Check yourselves!
- Stay right there.

25:48.811 --> 25:52.082
Sam, where's Mike?

25:54.483 --> 25:55.819
I'm sorry.

25:55.851 --> 25:57.721
Shit.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.828
Haley? Kale?

26:08.632 --> 26:11.769
It was a group of marauders.
We were ambushed.

26:11.801 --> 26:15.738
Sam, what the hell is goin' on
here and who the hell is he?

26:15.771 --> 26:18.775
His name is Rourke and if it
wasn't for him I'd be dead, too.

26:18.809 --> 26:20.810
You gotta quit bringin' back
strays, Sam.

26:20.844 --> 26:23.046
Eventually you're gonna bring
back the wrong kind.

26:23.078 --> 26:25.048
Are you in charge here?

26:25.080 --> 26:26.149
Hey.

26:29.618 --> 26:32.588
Where are you from, mister?

26:32.621 --> 26:34.490
New York.

26:34.523 --> 26:36.893
New York? How the hell'd you get
all the way down here then?

26:36.926 --> 26:39.195
I drove.

26:39.229 --> 26:40.831
All by yourself?

26:40.864 --> 26:42.566
Wait a second, you've been
on your own...

26:42.598 --> 26:44.534
ever since the plague started?

26:44.568 --> 26:46.136
Yeah, hunting.

26:46.168 --> 26:49.005
Fuck you! Hunting them? What are
you gonna do, kill 'em all?

26:49.039 --> 26:50.907
There's millions of those
goddamn things out there!

26:50.941 --> 26:52.509
Yeah, well, there's a lot
less of 'em...

26:52.541 --> 26:53.676
from here to the Bronx,
asshole.

26:53.710 --> 26:54.978
This fuckin' guy's crazy.

26:55.011 --> 26:57.013
Christ, Frank, we're not gonna
let this guy stay here, are we?

26:57.047 --> 27:01.084
What are you, ex-military
or a convict?

27:01.117 --> 27:02.719
What does that matter?

27:02.751 --> 27:04.655
Drew was a convict,
and no offense...

27:04.687 --> 27:06.924
but Vlad wasn't exactly a saint
and we took him in.

27:06.956 --> 27:09.626
No offense, I don't fuckin'
like Drew and I can't stand...

27:09.658 --> 27:11.661
fuckin' Vlad being here either,
to be honest with you!

27:11.694 --> 27:12.879
Fuck you!

27:12.880 --> 27:14.063
No, no, listen to me, either.

27:14.097 --> 27:15.632
I was promised fuel and
ammunition. She owes me.

27:15.665 --> 27:16.566
He killed Mike and fuckin'
attacked Sam!

27:16.599 --> 27:17.766
Give me what I need
and I'll get outta here.

27:18.799 --> 27:20.471
This guy could be one of those
fucks that attacked you...

27:20.503 --> 27:21.905
and killed Mike!

27:21.937 --> 27:23.540
Hey, you!

27:23.572 --> 27:25.475
You kill my brother,
mother fucker?

27:25.509 --> 27:27.176
Frank, it's gonna get outta
hand.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.846
You kill my brother,
mother fucker?

27:32.883 --> 27:35.552
We found a plane!

27:35.585 --> 27:37.754
What?

27:37.787 --> 27:42.759
We found a plane,
just outside of Fair Creek.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.161
It's not even 100 miles from
here. It's a cargo plane.

27:45.194 --> 27:46.963
It'll carry every single
one of us.

27:50.966 --> 27:55.071
Hey, show me. Come on.

27:56.973 --> 28:00.042
You come with us. Vlad?

28:00.076 --> 28:02.480
Let's move it out, man.

28:11.320 --> 28:14.724
This is where we got attacked
and this is where the plane is.

28:16.992 --> 28:19.730
It's just sittin' there,
waitin' for us.

28:24.166 --> 28:28.871
What do you think, Vince?
Can you fly us out on that?

28:28.905 --> 28:31.040
Well, it looks fine enough.

28:31.073 --> 28:33.009
What about the avionics?

28:33.042 --> 28:34.810
Landing gear and the rudders
looked good.

28:34.844 --> 28:37.047
There's nothing obstructing
the air.

28:37.079 --> 28:37.981
The engines?

28:38.013 --> 28:39.148
Oil looked good to me.

28:39.182 --> 28:40.550
There's no water in the
fuel tank.

28:40.584 --> 28:42.152
I'm only single engine
certified...

28:42.184 --> 28:44.021
and you told me what to look
for and I looked.

28:44.053 --> 28:47.290
This is the best option
that we have.

28:50.827 --> 28:53.130
Well, if the plane is what
she says it is, then...

28:55.831 --> 28:58.234
yeah, I'll make it fly.

29:01.171 --> 29:03.607
All we have to do is survive
the night...

29:03.639 --> 29:05.141
leave at the crack of dawn...

29:05.175 --> 29:10.880
and let this place disappear
in our rearview.

29:10.914 --> 29:14.718
In the meantime, I'm sorry,
but I don't trust you.

29:14.751 --> 29:16.853
I'm not tryin' to cause
trouble...

29:16.886 --> 29:19.123
but we're gonna be needi"
your weapons.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.859
Well, I hope you can walk
on water, old man...

29:23.893 --> 29:26.329
'cause you're gonna need
a fuckin' miracle...

29:26.363 --> 29:27.765
to make that happen.

29:29.331 --> 29:33.102
Hey, just give 'em the guns,
please.

29:45.048 --> 29:47.017
Ethan.

29:47.050 --> 29:50.186
If it's any consolation,
you will get 'em back.

29:50.220 --> 29:53.290
We'll stick with the deal
that Sam made with you.

29:53.322 --> 29:56.926
We'll give you fuel, ammo,
whatever you need.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.329
But for tonight your ass is
gonna be locked in a cell.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.199
Fuckin', thank you!

30:02.232 --> 30:04.300
Frank, come on,
he gave you his guns.

30:04.334 --> 30:07.070
What if it was a scam?

30:07.103 --> 30:10.273
He works his way in here,
tries to kill us in our sleep...

30:10.306 --> 30:12.309
take everything we have.

30:12.341 --> 30:14.077
But he saved my life.

30:14.078 --> 30:15.812
It is decided.

30:24.386 --> 30:26.723
Let me show you to your room.

30:39.168 --> 30:42.104
You'll have to excuse my old
man. He bleeds blue.

30:42.137 --> 30:44.875
He did prior to this shit
happening, anyways.

30:44.907 --> 30:47.977
He was chief of detectives back
when detectives still mattered.

30:48.011 --> 30:49.713
Then we lose Mom.

30:49.745 --> 30:55.051
My brother Evan becomes one
of those... things.

30:55.085 --> 30:58.288
I guess he kinda lost the plot
a little after that.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.256
There's plenty of that
goin' around.

31:00.290 --> 31:04.427
Yeah, well, the whole world's
gone crazy, right?

31:04.461 --> 31:10.733
So, lemme ask you,
what's crazy in a crazy world?

31:10.767 --> 31:12.202
Do you wanna hold my baby?

31:12.234 --> 31:14.136
Come on, follow me.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.342
So, why don't you guys just
drive straight through?

31:19.375 --> 31:21.912
It's at least three days'
drive to Baja.

31:21.944 --> 31:23.413
With all the families,
the children...

31:23.445 --> 31:27.083
we'd never have lasted
that long on the road.

31:27.117 --> 31:30.921
And if the marauders didn't get
to us, these things would've.

31:30.953 --> 31:32.822
It'd be like ringin' the
dinner bell.

31:32.856 --> 31:35.892
That's why we needed that plane.

31:35.925 --> 31:40.062
This, you know, we really
believed our defenses...

31:40.096 --> 31:41.498
would hold, you know?

31:41.530 --> 31:45.367
Our plan was to wait 'em out,
rebuild.

31:45.401 --> 31:47.037
Figured eventually these
things...

31:47.069 --> 31:48.739
would starve themselves
to death.

31:48.771 --> 31:50.473
Our mistake.

31:54.476 --> 31:56.746
That bigger one I shot
at at the garage?

31:56.780 --> 31:58.749
- The one in the camo?
- Yeah.

31:58.781 --> 32:01.050
He's new... showed up
out of the blue...

32:01.084 --> 32:03.220
maybe two, three weeks ago.

32:03.252 --> 32:07.057
Big son of a bitch, and this
one's a little different...

32:07.089 --> 32:11.828
he... he watches.

32:11.860 --> 32:14.097
We're guessin' he's the one that
led the rest of these things...

32:14.129 --> 32:15.765
to us, 'cause they've been
hittin' us hard...

32:15.799 --> 32:17.934
every night ever since, man.

32:17.966 --> 32:20.169
Gathering like roaches up
at that hotel.

32:20.203 --> 32:23.106
Where's that exactly?

32:23.138 --> 32:24.157
The Baker?

32:24.158 --> 32:25.175
Yeah.

32:25.207 --> 32:29.213
About a mile from here.
It's infested, man.

32:35.885 --> 32:39.088
Listen, pal, my dad's good
on his word, okay?

32:39.121 --> 32:41.224
He'll live up to the deal.

32:44.226 --> 32:48.865
Hey, thanks for bringin'
Sam home safe.

32:54.570 --> 32:57.940
Take a look at the bright side,
you're a lot safer in this cage.

33:00.242 --> 33:02.346
Just keep an eye on him.

35:06.002 --> 35:08.438
I'm sorry about them locking
you up like this.

35:13.508 --> 35:17.579
Hey, what was New York like?

35:17.613 --> 35:24.154
Same as everywhere else,
people dead, dying.

35:25.521 --> 35:28.725
I never got to see it.
I always wanted to.

35:28.758 --> 35:31.127
I was gonna go to law school
and get married...

35:31.160 --> 35:36.098
have kids, all that stuff.

35:36.131 --> 35:40.202
You met Ethan. I was engaged to
his younger brother, Evan.

35:40.236 --> 35:43.740
We were at home when
everything happened.

35:43.772 --> 35:46.242
The news said, "Stay in your
homes, lock your doors...

35:46.274 --> 35:49.211
"you'll be safe there,"
so that's where we were.

35:52.015 --> 35:57.087
Two of them got in and Evan told
me to go to the bathroom...

35:57.120 --> 36:01.525
and lock the door and hide
and that's exactly what I did.

36:03.359 --> 36:07.063
I can remember sitting on the
cold floor and just covering...

36:07.095 --> 36:10.566
my ears like a scared
little kid...

36:10.600 --> 36:13.336
but I could still hear
all this noise...

36:13.368 --> 36:15.637
and then it just stopped...

36:15.671 --> 36:18.508
and when he came in after me,
he wasn't Evan anymore.

36:20.642 --> 36:23.312
He'd forgotten who I was.

36:23.345 --> 36:26.515
If Ethan hadn't showed up,
I'd be dead.

36:26.548 --> 36:29.084
He had to kill his own brother.

36:29.118 --> 36:32.589
Nobody should have to do that,
you know?

36:32.622 --> 36:35.625
Once they turn, it doesn't
matter who they were before.

36:35.658 --> 36:40.130
They'll turn on you... faster
than you could pull the trigger.

36:42.365 --> 36:46.035
How do you think it
all happened?

36:46.068 --> 36:50.439
A lot of speculation on how it
happened, but it doesn't matter.

36:50.472 --> 36:53.609
Pretty obvious how
it's gonna end.

36:53.642 --> 36:57.414
No, there's a survivalist
colony in Baja.

36:57.446 --> 36:59.314
It's... it's in the middle
of the desert.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.817
It's remote, 150 miles
from the nearest anything.

37:01.850 --> 37:04.287
Even as fast as those things
are, they couldn't get to it...

37:04.319 --> 37:06.055
without burning to death first.

37:06.089 --> 37:09.059
Listen to me, it doesn't matter
how much distance...

37:09.091 --> 37:10.794
you put between you and them.

37:12.495 --> 37:14.564
They will find a way.

37:14.597 --> 37:17.100
Then why'd you even come here?

37:17.133 --> 37:18.801
I thought you wanted to get
on that plane.

37:20.736 --> 37:22.606
I never said that.

37:27.276 --> 37:32.816
You know, there's been somethi"
I've been thinkin' a lot about.

37:32.848 --> 37:37.187
Back in the garage, I saw your
face when the door closed.

37:37.220 --> 37:41.158
This moment of recognition
between you and that thing.

37:43.758 --> 37:46.396
You wanna tell me
what that was about?

37:48.330 --> 37:50.166
Yeah, he took somethin'
from me...

37:53.169 --> 37:56.173
and I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to get it back.

38:19.794 --> 38:23.532
Hey. I thought I told you
to watch her.

38:23.566 --> 38:25.201
Watch her do what?

38:25.234 --> 38:27.303
Feed a fake baby a real nipple?

38:27.336 --> 38:30.573
It's okay, get some rest.
I got her.

38:32.774 --> 38:35.912
I could stay if you want,
keep you company.

38:35.944 --> 38:39.281
It's okay, I got her.

38:39.314 --> 38:42.217
All right.

38:42.251 --> 38:44.453
There's only so many cats
left in the world, right?

38:44.486 --> 38:46.388
You're gonna fold eventually.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.330
I got nothin' on four.

39:27.363 --> 39:28.765
- Try three, Chris.
- Nothin'.

39:28.798 --> 39:30.533
- Once more, man.
- There's nothin', man.

39:30.566 --> 39:31.600
Ethan, what do we got?

39:31.633 --> 39:34.503
Dad, I got no feed, man.

39:34.537 --> 39:36.973
I got no cameras. I can't see
anything outside the building.

39:37.006 --> 39:39.341
No garage, no front entrance,
nothin'.

39:39.374 --> 39:41.243
I rigged this thing hard, man.

39:55.258 --> 39:56.960
Chris?

39:56.993 --> 39:59.395
These mother fuckers took
the cameras out.

39:59.428 --> 40:00.863
What the fuck are they doin'?

40:00.896 --> 40:02.497
Whatever it is, it's not good.

40:19.582 --> 40:21.551
God.

40:21.584 --> 40:22.919
Fuck!

40:22.952 --> 40:24.854
That's up top!

40:24.886 --> 40:27.823
Annabelle, stay here.
I'll be right back.

41:07.396 --> 41:08.830
Sophia.

41:08.863 --> 41:10.432
Quick, babe, quick!

41:29.852 --> 41:30.854
Vlad!

41:34.457 --> 41:35.825
Sam!

41:35.857 --> 41:37.626
- You okay?
- I'm good.

42:22.805 --> 42:25.607
Chris, get up on the fifth
and find out how they got in...

42:25.640 --> 42:26.776
and then seal it up.

42:26.809 --> 42:27.877
I'm on it.

42:46.127 --> 42:48.731
Fuck me, he's bleeding.
He's bit!

42:48.763 --> 42:53.535
Wait! Wai... it's...
It's okay, Frank.

42:55.771 --> 42:59.441
Frank, we can just cut it off.

42:59.475 --> 43:02.444
I'm sorry, Harker,
it's too late for that, man.

43:02.477 --> 43:04.479
Somebody do something real
fucking quick.

43:04.513 --> 43:05.815
We don't have much time.

43:05.847 --> 43:08.050
I said wait.

43:08.082 --> 43:12.488
Frank, please don't do this in
front of my little girl, okay?

43:14.756 --> 43:18.961
Sophia, I want you to go outside
with Miss Earnesta, okay?

43:18.993 --> 43:22.432
Sophia, Daddy loves you.

43:34.542 --> 43:35.979
Wait!

43:47.089 --> 43:48.857
Bag him.

43:56.097 --> 43:58.700
Please, everybody, listen up.

43:58.734 --> 44:01.604
The sun burns in four hours,
okay?

44:01.636 --> 44:05.575
Everybody rest up and be ready
to go at first light.

44:05.607 --> 44:11.680
Tomorrow, we leave this place,
so rest up.

44:44.178 --> 44:45.780
Open it up.

44:45.814 --> 44:50.252
Okay. We're hot. Striking.

44:53.289 --> 44:55.091
Hold it. Hold it.

44:57.626 --> 44:59.562
Somethin's got a hold of it.

44:59.595 --> 45:01.030
I don't know.

45:02.131 --> 45:04.701
Try it again.

45:07.303 --> 45:09.939
Motor's tryin'. It's engaged,
it just isn't going.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.709
One more time.

45:16.010 --> 45:17.012
Ho, ho, ho.

45:17.013 --> 45:18.013
Stop.

45:18.046 --> 45:19.781
You're gonna burn the motor out.

45:19.814 --> 45:21.216
What's goin' on?

45:21.249 --> 45:23.952
We gotta go around.
Chris, hold the fort down.

45:23.986 --> 45:25.021
You got it.

45:25.053 --> 45:26.122
- Bish?
- I don't know.

45:26.155 --> 45:28.290
Somethin's bindin' it.
Somethin's got a hold of it.

46:01.923 --> 46:04.092
Holy shit.

46:07.296 --> 46:09.332
So, that's what all the
noise was.

46:09.365 --> 46:11.334
They don't do shit like this.

46:16.238 --> 46:17.906
Fuck!

46:25.013 --> 46:26.781
I'm tellin' ya,
if we don't move them cars...

46:26.814 --> 46:28.316
the garage door ain't even
gonna budge...

46:28.350 --> 46:29.885
with all that weight on it.

46:29.917 --> 46:31.686
Nah, we'll never move enough
of that shit...

46:31.720 --> 46:33.656
to get us outta here before
nightfall.

46:33.689 --> 46:35.891
No, we get caught out in the
open road with all those...

46:35.923 --> 46:37.759
people after dark, then we'll
have every one of those...

46:37.792 --> 46:40.095
things from miles around chasi"
us all the way to the airport.

46:40.129 --> 46:41.864
If we even made it there.

46:41.897 --> 46:43.332
We'll just have to move
what we can today.

46:43.365 --> 46:45.067
Leave first thing in the
morning.

46:45.100 --> 46:46.836
This building ain't gonna
last 'til morning.

46:46.868 --> 46:48.169
No. No way.

46:48.202 --> 46:50.005
We move even half of that
shit today...

46:50.039 --> 46:52.040
and they'll just move it right
back when night comes.

46:52.073 --> 46:55.377
And they can do it all in one
night, they can do it all again.

46:55.410 --> 46:57.646
It would take us days
to clear a path...

46:57.680 --> 47:00.683
even if we knew how to do it
and if we had the means.

47:00.716 --> 47:03.685
What we gotta do is get vehicles
from the outside.

47:03.718 --> 47:06.988
Exactly. I mean, we just get
some of those...

47:07.022 --> 47:09.125
load up our shit and be
on our way.

47:09.158 --> 47:10.893
Nah, man, those vehicles
have been rotting...

47:10.926 --> 47:12.361
out there for three years.

47:12.394 --> 47:14.930
Batteries are dead,
tires are dry rotted.

47:14.963 --> 47:16.932
We're never gonna find enough
working vehicles...

47:16.964 --> 47:18.934
to get us outta here by sunset.

47:18.966 --> 47:21.169
There's gotta be a way.

47:21.202 --> 47:23.372
Take out their leader.

47:24.839 --> 47:26.709
What?

47:26.742 --> 47:30.812
I kill that Alpha and the rest
of those fuckin' animals...

47:30.845 --> 47:33.949
will be rippin' each other
apart to take his place.

47:36.218 --> 47:37.886
How do you know that?

47:37.919 --> 47:41.423
Because I've done it before...

47:41.457 --> 47:43.192
and that just might give you
the chance you need...

47:43.225 --> 47:45.027
to get to that plane.

47:45.060 --> 47:48.731
What the hell are you talkin'
about? You wanna go after them?

47:48.763 --> 47:51.099
Attacking those things
is the exact opposite...

47:51.133 --> 47:52.768
of what we need to do.

47:52.801 --> 47:55.037
You know, I'm tryin' to keep
these people alive?

47:55.069 --> 47:59.240
I'm not askin' for any of these
people to go with me.

47:59.274 --> 48:02.278
Well, what exactly are you
askin' for?

48:02.310 --> 48:07.048
Gunpowder, detonators,
explosives.

48:07.082 --> 48:08.784
You give me the supplies
I need...

48:08.816 --> 48:13.054
and I will hit that den
when they sleep.

48:13.088 --> 48:15.790
I knew it. This guy is gonna
lead us to our grave.

48:15.823 --> 48:17.225
Who the fuck are you...

48:17.258 --> 48:18.927
that we should be listenin'
to you anyway?

48:18.961 --> 48:20.930
And what the hell are you
even doin' in here?

48:20.963 --> 48:23.131
Why don't you shut your fucki"
mouth for once?

48:24.867 --> 48:26.169
So lemme get this straight...

48:26.202 --> 48:28.337
you're gonna make your way down
to the heart of these things...

48:28.370 --> 48:30.272
kill the Alpha on its own
turf...

48:30.305 --> 48:32.040
with the hopes of leaving the
other ones distracted...

48:32.073 --> 48:34.309
long enough so we can all hop
in our imaginary cars...

48:34.343 --> 48:36.846
and drive this very real
nightmare-filled...

48:36.879 --> 48:38.848
90-mile trip to Sam's plane?

48:38.881 --> 48:40.982
Yeah.

48:41.015 --> 48:43.084
Cool, just checkin'.

48:43.118 --> 48:47.123
That den, that hotel,
it's 12 stories of darkness...

48:47.156 --> 48:49.024
night and day.

48:49.057 --> 48:52.261
Yeah, they sleep in packs.
Lower levels, basement.

48:52.294 --> 48:54.930
That's where I'll find 'em.

48:54.963 --> 48:56.332
You know where they are...

48:56.365 --> 48:59.135
why don't you just burn the damn
building down?

48:59.167 --> 49:02.470
Yeah, I could... I could torch
the place...

49:02.504 --> 49:05.074
but as soon as one of those
things wakes up and screams...

49:05.106 --> 49:07.476
they'll scatter like roaches.

49:09.577 --> 49:11.513
I have to get the Alpha.

49:11.546 --> 49:14.751
That's all this is about for
you, isn't it? The Alpha.

49:18.519 --> 49:23.024
You wanna get outta here, right?
Fly off to this brave new world?

49:23.057 --> 49:25.226
Well, you give me what I want...

49:25.260 --> 49:29.198
and I'll at least make that
a possibility.

49:29.231 --> 49:32.468
You're not gonna get 25 feet
in that goddamn hotel.

49:32.501 --> 49:37.406
It's a death trap.
You know it and I know it.

49:40.975 --> 49:42.778
You're all runnin' out of time.

49:44.412 --> 49:46.982
You will die if you stay here.

49:52.086 --> 49:55.423
We have no other choice.
We gotta find them vehicles.

49:55.457 --> 49:57.893
This city had two million
people in it.

49:57.926 --> 49:59.495
We can find cars that run.

49:59.528 --> 50:03.064
Chief, it'll never work.

50:03.097 --> 50:05.867
Now, we may find the cars,
but...

50:05.901 --> 50:07.469
we'll never get to that plane
before dark.

50:07.502 --> 50:10.306
We just gotta hang on
a little longer.

50:10.339 --> 50:13.309
What's there to hang on to?
Chief?

50:13.341 --> 50:15.544
I mean, at least this guy's
got a plan...

50:15.577 --> 50:16.946
that gives us a fighting chance.

50:16.979 --> 50:18.580
Chris, what are you talkin'
about?

50:18.613 --> 50:20.949
What about Madeline?
What about Max?

50:20.982 --> 50:28.022
I already lost one family.
I ain't gonna lose another.

50:28.055 --> 50:31.559
Chief, I'd follow you to Hell
and back, you know that.

50:31.593 --> 50:35.865
But I'm sorry, today you're
wrong.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.170
He's right, Dad.

50:42.203 --> 50:44.539
We're not gonna make it to
that plane before nightfall.

50:44.573 --> 50:46.908
This could be our only chance.

50:50.211 --> 50:52.247
You wanna go? Go.

50:53.981 --> 50:57.853
You wanna die? Go die.

51:00.222 --> 51:03.059
The rest of us, we got
work to do.

51:12.935 --> 51:14.203
What?

51:14.236 --> 51:18.007
I don't trust Rourke.

51:18.039 --> 51:19.607
Well, let's not forget you're
the one that brought him here...

51:19.640 --> 51:21.343
in the first place, right?

51:21.376 --> 51:25.647
Well, maybe I shouldn't have.
Maybe I was wrong.

51:30.986 --> 51:34.957
Listen, Sam, I know it's all
about startin' over for you...

51:34.990 --> 51:38.526
all right? For all of us.

51:38.560 --> 51:41.230
But we tried, right?

51:41.263 --> 51:45.067
How can you just give up
like this?

51:45.100 --> 51:47.670
What about Frank? I mean, what
about all these people?

51:47.702 --> 51:49.170
They're our family now.

51:50.972 --> 51:55.376
You know, I used to be
a lot like you, Sam...

51:55.410 --> 51:58.013
think that maybe that somehow,
someway we could see this...

51:58.046 --> 52:03.252
through and now, I realize
sacrifices have to be made.

52:03.285 --> 52:05.020
What?

52:05.053 --> 52:07.556
Come on, Sam, we're all
just waitin'...

52:07.589 --> 52:09.658
for the inevitable here right?

52:09.691 --> 52:12.160
The thing is I made a decision.

52:12.193 --> 52:14.595
I do not want one of those
things standin' over me...

52:14.629 --> 52:16.098
when I take my final breath.

52:18.300 --> 52:21.669
I may not be able to beat 'em...

52:21.702 --> 52:25.206
but I'm not gonna sit here
and do nothin' either.

52:39.021 --> 52:41.055
There, is that good?

52:41.089 --> 52:42.391
It's good.

52:47.763 --> 52:52.334
Madeline, now you know
when I found you and Max...

52:52.367 --> 52:56.004
I said I'd look after you.

52:56.037 --> 52:59.774
I'm doin' this for us,
you understand that?

52:59.807 --> 53:01.209
I know.

53:08.450 --> 53:10.720
Come here, young man.

53:12.421 --> 53:15.223
Now you take care of your momma
for me, do ya hear?

53:27.669 --> 53:30.573
Hey, Dad?

53:33.374 --> 53:37.146
You remember when we were kids,
you used to tell Evan and I...

53:37.178 --> 53:40.415
stories about John Hunt Morgan
and his Raiders?

53:42.651 --> 53:44.252
They made it all the way
to Indiana...

53:44.285 --> 53:48.189
and Ohio during the Civil War.

53:48.222 --> 53:50.291
It was the farthest north
any of the Confederates...

53:50.325 --> 53:52.160
had ever traveled.

53:52.193 --> 53:56.197
They drew tens of thousands of
Federals away from their duties.

53:56.231 --> 54:00.836
But the south lost the war
and Morgan and his Raiders...

54:00.868 --> 54:02.805
they were all slaughtered.

54:02.838 --> 54:08.176
Yeah, they were slaughtered,
but not on that day.

54:10.879 --> 54:15.217
Listen, Dad, I know it's been
different since Evan.

54:15.249 --> 54:17.552
I know that.

54:17.586 --> 54:19.521
For what's it's worth...

54:19.553 --> 54:23.291
I want you to know that I'm
sorry that I had to be the one.

54:50.685 --> 54:54.223
Come to see me off?

54:54.256 --> 54:57.693
That's sweet.
See you later, crocodile.

54:57.725 --> 55:00.394
Don't do this, Drew.

55:00.428 --> 55:03.531
Rourke knows what he's doin',
all right? He's got a plan.

55:03.564 --> 55:05.867
Does he?

55:05.901 --> 55:07.336
Kiss me and I'll stay.

55:07.337 --> 55:08.771
I'm serious, Drew.

55:10.305 --> 55:15.310
So was I. See ya.

55:34.662 --> 55:37.498
Up the street is a stop sign
with the center shot out.

55:37.531 --> 55:39.535
It's 300 yards.

55:39.568 --> 55:41.937
Crosswind is comin' in cuttin'
through these buildings...

55:41.970 --> 55:44.173
wreak havoc on my bullets.

55:44.205 --> 55:46.175
So, if you find yourself
in a heap of trouble...

55:46.207 --> 55:49.244
make it back to that marker and
I'll cover you from up top.

55:59.386 --> 56:02.658
Sam, get those people moving.
We gotta find some vehicles.

56:02.691 --> 56:05.827
And Weston, get that front door
camera back online.

56:05.859 --> 56:07.662
Copy that, Chief, I'm on it.

56:07.696 --> 56:09.198
You heard him.

56:33.421 --> 56:34.756
What day is it?

56:34.789 --> 56:36.892
July 27th.

56:36.925 --> 56:38.693
I thought so.

56:38.727 --> 56:40.295
Why?

56:40.327 --> 56:43.531
My son's birthday is two days
from now.

56:43.564 --> 56:44.899
I used to send him a card
every year...

56:44.932 --> 56:47.335
but I never heard anything back.

56:49.838 --> 56:52.707
National Guard did all they
could to protect us.

56:54.743 --> 56:56.445
And where we're headin',
this hotel...

56:56.477 --> 56:58.479
they made their last stand
there.

56:58.513 --> 57:00.515
Didn't realize they were
just packin' meat...

57:00.548 --> 57:02.350
in one place like a goddamn
buffet.

57:02.383 --> 57:05.386
They lasted two days.

57:05.419 --> 57:08.322
Yeah, I wanted to get down
there myself. Hell, we all did.

57:08.356 --> 57:11.593
Luckily, Frank talked me out
of it. Kept us all together.

57:11.626 --> 57:14.562
I remember when Frank brought
Drew in for his DUI...

57:14.595 --> 57:16.464
right when the plague started.
Right, Drew?

57:16.497 --> 57:17.565
Yeah.

57:17.566 --> 57:18.633
Been with us ever since.

57:18.667 --> 57:21.403
Vlad, on the other hand,
we found Vlad wandering...

57:21.435 --> 57:23.372
the city half-naked
and starvin' to death.

57:23.405 --> 57:25.673
You couldn't right a better
story, actually.

57:25.707 --> 57:28.542
Him and his Russian commando
platoon jacked this airliner...

57:28.575 --> 57:30.011
out of Moscow.

57:30.044 --> 57:33.347
Brought it all the way to Miami
and crash landed, right?

57:33.381 --> 57:36.518
Hey, Vlad, man, now you Russians
can fight and drink vodka...

57:36.551 --> 57:37.853
but you can't fly planes?
What's up with that?

57:37.885 --> 57:39.588
Don't worry, buddy.

57:39.620 --> 57:41.656
If I lived in Russia, I'd wanna
get the fuck out, too.

57:50.397 --> 57:52.501
They're gonna be in the deepest,
darkest hole in this place.

57:52.533 --> 57:54.468
The basement.

57:54.502 --> 57:57.339
Exactly, and that's where
we're gonna bury 'em.

57:57.372 --> 58:01.542
Listen, if shit goes south, find
an exit, head towards the light.

58:01.575 --> 58:05.646
You two with the rope, if we get
split up, head to the roof.

58:05.680 --> 58:07.316
We'll rappel from there.

59:36.905 --> 59:39.140
How's it going out there,
people? Any luck?

59:39.173 --> 59:41.175
Nothin' yet.

59:41.209 --> 59:43.678
There's nothing on my end,
either. Earnesta and I split up.

59:43.711 --> 59:47.182
Doesn't look good. This place
is fucked up, man.

59:47.214 --> 59:48.816
Well, why don't you just
kick it up a notch?

59:48.850 --> 59:50.085
We don't find some
transportation...

59:50.118 --> 59:51.119
we're not gettin' outta here.

59:51.151 --> 59:52.186
You got that?

59:52.220 --> 59:53.455
Copy that.

01:02:25.707 --> 01:02:28.710
We set the charges at both
exits.

01:02:28.743 --> 01:02:31.780
We trap these fuckers down here,
crush 'em and let 'em burn.

01:02:33.881 --> 01:02:36.084
And who's gonna put that bomb
on the other exit?

01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:43.325
Lemme do it.

01:02:45.126 --> 01:02:47.963
I'm serious.
Look, I can do this.

01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:49.231
I wanna do it.

01:02:51.732 --> 01:02:53.868
No pressure, but it's all
up to you.

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:56.338
Just don't fuck it up, okay?

01:03:00.207 --> 01:03:01.209
Come on.

01:03:23.164 --> 01:03:24.966
Not a sound.

01:04:41.075 --> 01:04:42.210
No!

01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:17.412
Go! Go!

01:05:45.439 --> 01:05:47.341
Where's Chris?

01:05:47.374 --> 01:05:49.010
I said, "Where's Chris?"

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:58.352
It's over.

01:05:58.385 --> 01:06:00.187
What? What the fuck are you
talkin' about?

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.892
What's over, Vlad? What?

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:07.295
It's fuckin' over. Go.

01:06:07.327 --> 01:06:09.230
What the fuck are you
talkin' a...

01:06:30.051 --> 01:06:31.953
Fuck! Shit!

01:09:56.757 --> 01:09:58.560
I think they're goin' after
Chris.

01:10:00.694 --> 01:10:04.031
Chris, it's Ethan, do you copy?

01:10:04.065 --> 01:10:06.501
Chris, it's Ethan, do you copy?

01:10:06.534 --> 01:10:10.638
<i>CHRIS I'm here, man,
but I'm in bad fuckin' shape.</i>

01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:12.306
<i>Those things are right outside
my door...</i>

01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:14.175
<i>and they're gonna get in.</i>

01:10:14.208 --> 01:10:16.511
Okay, listen to me. Stay put.
We may have a way to find you.

01:10:16.543 --> 01:10:17.744
Just stay where you are.

01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:19.614
<i>Nah, it's too late.</i>

01:10:19.646 --> 01:10:21.681
<i>Now you just tell Max and
Madeline I love 'em.</i>

01:10:21.714 --> 01:10:25.352
No, you hold tight, Chris. I'm
comin' to get you, you hear me?

01:10:25.386 --> 01:10:29.123
<i>But you're gonna need my rope.
I think I'm just below you.</i>

01:10:29.155 --> 01:10:31.725
<i>I'm gonna try.</i>

01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:42.169
Listen, when that sun
comes down...

01:10:42.203 --> 01:10:44.439
those fuckers are gonna be
on us again, man.

01:10:52.846 --> 01:10:57.551
We need the rope.
We need the fuckin' rope!

01:10:57.584 --> 01:11:00.120
Chris has the rope.
I think he's right beneath us.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:11.765
Hey, wait a minute.

01:11:11.798 --> 01:11:15.336
This thing's been after you
the whole time, right?

01:11:15.369 --> 01:11:17.705
It's after you.

01:13:13.654 --> 01:13:17.691
Hey, you want me? Come on!

01:13:31.271 --> 01:13:33.274
Come on, mother fucker!

01:14:22.623 --> 01:14:24.626
Let's go.

01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:48.850
Go.

01:15:01.794 --> 01:15:03.397
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:15:11.838 --> 01:15:14.007
I'm out!

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.376
Fuck.

01:15:35.796 --> 01:15:37.664
We'll hook up on that ladder.

01:15:42.636 --> 01:15:44.405
What's the problem? We gotta go.

01:15:44.437 --> 01:15:46.106
I ain't goin' anywhere.

01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:52.747
Chris got me.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:16:00.053
What are friends for, right?

01:16:01.454 --> 01:16:03.591
Man, come on.

01:16:03.623 --> 01:16:05.760
Come on, take a look at this,
man.

01:16:10.196 --> 01:16:12.800
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:16:22.476 --> 01:16:24.044
I tell you something.
There is a bright side.

01:16:24.077 --> 01:16:26.814
At least I don't get eaten
by one of those things.

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:07.888
Rest easy, brother.

01:17:15.262 --> 01:17:17.665
Come on, come on, come on.

01:17:24.971 --> 01:17:28.475
<i>SAM
Frank. Frank.</i>

01:17:28.508 --> 01:17:30.877
Frank, we got one. We got a car.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:34.114
That a girl. Come on back
here right now.

01:17:34.146 --> 01:17:35.982
I'll be right there.

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:20.026
Looks like you weren't
the only one...

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.896
able to find a ride, princess.

01:18:21.928 --> 01:18:23.730
It's not enough.

01:18:23.763 --> 01:18:25.565
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, it's not enough.

01:18:25.598 --> 01:18:27.234
We've got close
to 40 people here.

01:18:27.266 --> 01:18:30.003
All right, well, fuck that.
It'll take whoever we can take.

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:31.939
It's every man for himself
right now.

01:18:31.971 --> 01:18:33.907
Why the hell'd you even come
back here, then?

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:37.144
Because I can't fly a goddamn
plane. Vince, get in the car.

01:18:37.177 --> 01:18:39.179
- Come on, get in the car.
- You're a piece of shit, Dugan.

01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:41.281
Vince, come on, let's go.
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:18:41.315 --> 01:18:44.084
Dugan, you piece of shit,
he's not gettin' in the car.

01:18:44.117 --> 01:18:46.787
Come on, Vince. I'm not
fuckin'...

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.956
Holy shit.

01:18:51.057 --> 01:18:53.593
Now we're talkin'.

01:18:53.627 --> 01:18:54.695
Baby.

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:55.763
Vince. Vince, come on.

01:18:55.796 --> 01:18:57.865
Think we all fit now, asshole.

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.236
Yeah!

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:05.006
Anybody need a ride?

01:19:08.307 --> 01:19:10.578
Yeah, baby!

01:19:19.218 --> 01:19:20.354
Incoming!

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.883
Take them get inside!
Come on!

01:19:50.751 --> 01:19:52.019
Go.

01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:03.864
Go! Come on!

01:20:37.864 --> 01:20:40.935
We gotta go! Chief, now!

01:20:48.874 --> 01:20:54.147
No, Max! Max! Max!
No, Max! Max! Max!

01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:55.449
Let's go!

01:20:55.481 --> 01:20:57.118
Max! Max!

01:21:01.855 --> 01:21:03.723
Madeline, let's go!

01:21:25.378 --> 01:21:27.281
Come on, come on, come on.

01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:33.988
Wait, Jacob! Jacob!

01:21:47.833 --> 01:21:51.003
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:21:51.037 --> 01:21:53.240
They're comin', help us!

01:22:03.283 --> 01:22:05.218
Jacob.

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:13.894
Where is my husband?

01:22:28.107 --> 01:22:30.843
You got 'em all killed,
didn't you?

01:22:30.877 --> 01:22:33.213
I didn't ask anybody to go
with me.

01:22:33.245 --> 01:22:35.348
You should be layin' out
there with 'em!

01:22:35.382 --> 01:22:38.118
My son would be here right now
if it hadn't been for you.

01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:40.520
We're all on borrowed time,
old man.

01:22:40.553 --> 01:22:43.457
At least he had the fucki"
guts to go with me.

01:22:43.489 --> 01:22:44.925
- Hey.
- Chief, no!

01:22:44.958 --> 01:22:46.160
Goddamn it!

01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:48.462
Shut up! Just shut up,
both of you!

01:22:48.494 --> 01:22:50.131
All right, nobody's plan worked!

01:22:51.832 --> 01:22:53.267
Damn you.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.901
We gotta figure this out
together...

01:22:54.935 --> 01:22:56.403
or we're all gonna fucking
die here!

01:22:56.436 --> 01:22:58.539
Then what the hell are we
gonna do?

01:22:58.571 --> 01:23:00.973
We can't fight all these
goddamn things!

01:23:01.007 --> 01:23:03.343
I shot that Alpha three times,
right in the chest.

01:23:03.376 --> 01:23:04.845
He just kept comin'.

01:23:04.878 --> 01:23:06.847
- Maybe you missed.
- I didn't miss!

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:10.184
That thing's just different than
the others. It just won't die.

01:23:10.217 --> 01:23:13.154
Everything dies.

01:23:21.962 --> 01:23:23.830
Piece of shit!

01:23:38.578 --> 01:23:40.247
My God.

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.915
Man, they're everywhere.

01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:44.351
Never gonna get past that many.

01:23:44.383 --> 01:23:47.287
Shit! Look! Fuckin' Dugan.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.857
What the hell's he doing?

01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:52.526
He's tryin' to make a run
for it.

01:23:52.559 --> 01:23:55.095
He won't last 30 seconds
out there.

01:23:55.128 --> 01:23:59.967
Yeah, not a chance& and we're
gonna use him.

01:24:00.934 --> 01:24:02.369
As bait?

01:24:42.508 --> 01:24:44.244
Shit!

01:24:52.953 --> 01:24:54.254
Fuck!

01:25:35.028 --> 01:25:37.230
What do ya say, old man?

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:40.533
Those things will be
back here soon.

01:25:40.566 --> 01:25:43.270
You ready to make that stand?

01:25:45.238 --> 01:25:49.275
Those are your people out there.
They need you.

01:26:12.132 --> 01:26:15.002
Ain't no secret I don't like
losin' a fight.

01:26:15.034 --> 01:26:20.039
Never have, never will.
Not to nobody. Not to nothin'.

01:26:20.073 --> 01:26:24.778
Especially when it's somethin'
really worth fightin' for...

01:26:24.811 --> 01:26:30.450
and that's what this fight is
all about, people, survival.

01:26:30.482 --> 01:26:33.720
So, it's really quite simple,
folks.

01:26:33.753 --> 01:26:37.024
If we hold the line tonight,
all these people will live.

01:26:37.056 --> 01:26:41.561
If we don't, if we fail,
they'll all die.

01:26:44.564 --> 01:26:46.665
He's right.

01:26:46.699 --> 01:26:51.038
If you want these people
to survive, it's up to you.

01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:55.508
Make it count.

01:27:02.815 --> 01:27:06.352
Bish?

01:27:06.386 --> 01:27:08.754
We'll see each other again,
Chief.

01:27:08.788 --> 01:27:12.126
Yeah, thanks for sticking
around.

01:27:32.278 --> 01:27:36.784
Your Katie? What was she like?

01:27:48.794 --> 01:27:50.463
She was perfect.

01:27:54.534 --> 01:27:56.370
She was everything.

01:28:01.507 --> 01:28:03.609
And the Alpha killed her?

01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:10.450
It turned her.

01:28:16.355 --> 01:28:18.257
I couldn't leave her like that.

01:28:23.663 --> 01:28:28.135
Wait. I wanna stay.

01:28:28.168 --> 01:28:30.137
Lemme help you.

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:34.306
If we don't make it
out of here...

01:28:34.339 --> 01:28:39.413
those people are gonna need
somebody, somebody to lead them.

01:28:45.618 --> 01:28:47.754
Somebody with hope.

01:33:05.144 --> 01:33:06.713
Fuck.

01:33:32.838 --> 01:33:34.573
Shit.

01:33:34.606 --> 01:33:36.976
It's all right, we're good
to go, baby. Okay?

01:33:38.711 --> 01:33:40.446
Fuck!

01:34:07.839 --> 01:34:09.775
I'm sorry.

01:34:10.743 --> 01:34:13.113
I love you!

01:39:55.587 --> 01:39:58.023
You're not comin' with us,
are you?

01:40:00.559 --> 01:40:02.528
There's still more of 'em
out there.

01:40:02.561 --> 01:40:05.097
But you killed it.
You killed the Alpha.

01:40:05.129 --> 01:40:07.266
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:40:12.471 --> 01:40:14.908
Hang on to that hope, Sam.

01:40:22.347 --> 01:40:27.118

01:40:27.151 --> 01:40:29.288
<i># Wasn't what I would call myself #</i>

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.422
Let's go, Vince.

01:40:30.423 --> 01:40:31.524
All right.

01:40:31.556 --> 01:40:34.626

water's edge #</i>
