[Sam]<i> Fear is as common</i>

00:10.886 --> 00:12.346
<i>as it is among us humans.</i>

00:12.638 --> 00:15.390
-So what do I do now?
-[Casey] You just dip it in.

00:16.391 --> 00:20.771
[Sam] <i>When they're flipped over some toads</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:25.943
-It's amazing, right?
-Yeah.

00:26.276 --> 00:29.196
It tastes like cheese dipped
in apple juice.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.489
Exactly!

00:32.157 --> 00:34.034
[imitates explosion]

00:34.117 --> 00:36.495
You miss your friends, don't you? Huh?

00:36.578 --> 00:38.455
-Lonely girl.
-No. Shut up.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.250
-[Evan chuckles]
-Izzie would've loved this, though.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.001
Attention, everybody!

00:44.211 --> 00:45.796
[pants] It's finally finished.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.047
What's this?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.258
My portfolio for art school.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.260
Hey!

00:51.635 --> 00:54.638
No eating around the portfolio.
Especially not cheese dipped

00:54.721 --> 00:57.266
in apple juice.
That's just asking for trouble.

00:57.349 --> 01:01.061
-Hey, Sam... this is amazing.
-I know.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.105
ANTARCTIC PENGUINS

01:03.188 --> 01:04.147
ANTARCTICA
SOUTH POLE

01:04.231 --> 01:05.232
[Casey] It really is.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.904
[Casey] I thought it was weird
when you said you wanted to pursue art

01:10.988 --> 01:14.741
instead of something science-y,
like penguin studies or whatever,

01:14.825 --> 01:17.494
but... this is really good.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.832
It's late in the application process,
so I really need to knock their socks off.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.418
-That's a phrase.
-[Evan] Indeed.

01:25.127 --> 01:28.630
I'm applying to a place called
the Rhode Island School of Design,

01:28.714 --> 01:31.633
also called RISD,
in Providence, Rhode Island.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.970
-It's a very good school.
-That's really cool.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.931
I've never been to Rhode Island.
Actually...

01:38.390 --> 01:39.725
I've never been anywhere.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.809
Me neither.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.353
Yeah, I figure why travel?

01:43.437 --> 01:46.148
Beth wakes me up
with fresh morning pastries every day.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.359
So, that's a routine
that I'm just not willing to give up.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.445
I like my routines too.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.113
A lot.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.908
Yeah, but it's going to be great.
I mean, you'll make new routines.

01:56.992 --> 02:00.579
Yeah, and you're gonna make new friends,
you're gonna go to new classes.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.874
You'll get a pair of new New Balances.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.209
You can go check out your new hood...

02:06.668 --> 02:08.170
-Dude.
-What?

02:09.546 --> 02:10.881
That's a lot of new stuff.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.302
[Sam] <i>In humans, fear may look different,</i>
<i>but it's caused by the same things.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:18.430
No, Sam. It's gonna be fine. Really.

02:18.513 --> 02:22.684
[Sam] <i>A predator, a loud noise,</i>
<i>a change in your environment.</i>

02:22.768 --> 02:23.769
I mean,Â look at me.

02:23.852 --> 02:27.773
I didn't want to go
to Clayton and now, well...

02:29.066 --> 02:31.693
I hate it, but that's a bad example.

02:31.777 --> 02:36.615
Yeah, well, it's perfectly...
normal to be a little bit nervous.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.410
You just... You need to just
take your mind off stuff, you know?

02:40.619 --> 02:42.704
-Maybe blow off a little bit of steam.
-Yeah.

02:43.330 --> 02:47.668
Well, the wisest man I know did tell me
the perfect way to blow off steam.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.712
-Awesome, dude. Do that.
-Yeah.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.422
-[tennis ball machine thumps]
-[gasps]

02:52.506 --> 02:53.507
You were right.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.052
This does take my mind off things.
My mind is on nothing.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.597
[grunts] One word. Three letters.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.515
Duh.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.266
[both yell]

03:11.358 --> 03:13.193
CLAYTON IS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

03:13.276 --> 03:17.239
[coach] An alumna painted that.
Actually, someone I went to school with.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.990
Ironically, she was a real asshole.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.410
[chuckles]

03:21.993 --> 03:23.120
So how you doing?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.540
I haven't seen you
with the team much lately, you girls okay?

03:27.916 --> 03:28.750
Yep.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.711
You sure?

03:32.838 --> 03:33.714
I'm fine.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.134
Well, we need to talk biology.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.219
Mr. Kawahara says you're failing.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.514
And if you can't get your grade up,
you'll lose your scholarship.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.349
What? No, I...

03:45.308 --> 03:47.102
I can't afford this place without it.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.730
I know,
but there's still time to fix this.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.942
Not as much time as if you'd come
to me weeks ago when I'd asked.

03:54.609 --> 03:58.113
Sorry. I...
I just had, like, a lot going on, so--

03:58.530 --> 04:00.323
Now it's time to buckle down.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.994
Kawahara says that you'll be fine
if you ace the midterm.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.705
So that's your mission,
beat biology class.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.584
I promise I will eat,
sleep, and breathe biology.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.504
Biology, it's what's for breakfast!

04:17.340 --> 04:19.217
[sighs] Okay, bye.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.226
[phone ringing]

04:29.352 --> 04:30.437
Hello?

04:32.773 --> 04:33.607
Who?

04:33.690 --> 04:38.236
[singing]

04:45.410 --> 04:46.411
Wow.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.750
Thank you, Sabrina, for singing
your answer to "How was your day?"

04:51.833 --> 04:53.710
And quite beautifully, I might add.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.631
Oh! Hi, Sam. We're about to get started,
why don't you take a seat.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.257
I got an interview with RISD.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.302
Really? Sam, that is great news.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.137
RISD is a fantastic school.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.599
I know. I worked so hard
on my art portfolio.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.310
I'm very proud. Do you want to see it?
It's in my backpack.

05:10.393 --> 05:14.272
Well, we will all look at it after group.
But until then, yay, Sam!

05:16.775 --> 05:18.985
Yay, Sam. Are you excited?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.863
I'm mostly excited.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.700
However, in my initial research,
I discovered some alarming details.

05:25.784 --> 05:30.163
The campus is on a hill and I don't like
the idea of living at an angle.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.958
I couldn't find chicken fingers
on the cafeteria menu.

05:33.041 --> 05:36.753
I'm hoping the online menu is incomplete
or seasonal.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.172
And according to my research,

05:39.256 --> 05:42.759
a large number of artists die
penniless and alone,

05:43.009 --> 05:46.304
but I'm trying to stay optimistic
'cause my mom and Paige told me to.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.266
No chicken fingers? Dying alone?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.268
That sounds awful. You shouldn't go.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.895
[Ms. Whitaker] There will definitely be
some things to get used to,

05:53.979 --> 05:56.857
but this is a huge accomplishment, Sam.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.443
You guys, sometimes I feel like we focus
so much on what's difficult

06:00.527 --> 06:02.988
that we forget to celebrate
our accomplishments.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.198
[Ms. Whitaker]
Who else had an accomplishment this week?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.451
I went to a new dentist.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.454
-She was okay.
-Really? How cool, Lily.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.623
-And I have two cavities.
-That's less cool.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.796
[Julia]
This is gonna be difficult, but worth it.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.425
So, here are some resources
to help you get started.

06:23.508 --> 06:27.095
I might've gone a little overboard.
I'm really excited. [chuckles]

06:27.178 --> 06:30.348
-So are we.
-Elsa has a stack like this at home.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.018
-Kindred nerd spirits.
-[both chuckle]

06:33.226 --> 06:37.105
Well, I think this first responders
training is such a great idea.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.190
I mean, law enforcement,
the medical community,

06:39.274 --> 06:41.151
they can't always recognize
the signs of autism.

06:41.234 --> 06:45.196
No, I get it. I would probably
be the same way if it wasn't for Sam.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.074
-He's been dealing with so much.
-Yeah. We've had a lot going on.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.745
-Been a tough time in our family.
-Yeah, really tough.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.624
Yeah. Anyways, that website is
for a group that does similar training,

06:55.707 --> 06:58.835
-so if you want to take a look--
-Okay. I'm going to come out and say it.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.003
[slaps hand]

07:00.086 --> 07:02.047
I cheated on Doug with a bartender.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.966
I'm just, I'm trying to be more honest.

07:05.383 --> 07:10.096
Okay. Well, like I was saying,
that nonprofit focuses on groups--

07:10.180 --> 07:12.682
But things are getting better.
Don't you think?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.810
Getting there.
It's good to be doing things together.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.146
You know, on the same team.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.439
I agree.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.526
I mean, I know I have a long way to go
before I'm forgiven.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.573
But I do feel like there's more intimacy.
I mean, not that kind of intimacy.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.450
It's not-- Not sex stuff.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.370
-No.
-But...

07:34.329 --> 07:37.832
I do want to be special to him
in that way.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.628
And I feel like we...

07:42.629 --> 07:43.755
I feel like we deserve that.

07:50.595 --> 07:54.307
Well, I have another client waiting. So...

07:54.391 --> 07:56.351
-Sorry.
-We could go on and on.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.436
-I bet.
-Yeah, it's a bunch to discuss.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.896
-Yeah.
-Okay. Um...

07:59.980 --> 08:01.648
J. SASAKI, Ph.D.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.483
All right, off you go.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.734
-Good to see ya.
-You too.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.486
Yeah, this was great. Thank you.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.031
Hey. There's no one here yet.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.117
-There will be.
-Okay. Thanks...

08:13.910 --> 08:15.495
So I'll see you at home.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.581
I'm gonna make a cake.
I just feel like making a cake, so...

08:18.665 --> 08:22.752
I'm actually... I'm gonna meet a friend
from Sam's peer group.

08:22.836 --> 08:27.966
She's a social worker, we're discussing
doing something similar at the hospital.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.551
Oh, wow, that's great.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.887
It's nice to see you
so passionate about this.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.056
It's nice to feel passionate
about something.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.896

STOP YELLING AT ME!

09:04.085 --> 09:05.170
[sighs]

09:10.175 --> 09:12.552
So talk to me about your interview outfit.

09:12.927 --> 09:16.306
I don't know, pants and a shirt.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.433
What I always wear
when I'm not wearing this.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.393
Gag me with a spoon, brother.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.063
Yo, artists are supposed to be
eccentric lunatics.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.273
You've seen that 'stache on SalvadorÂ DalÃ­.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.691
You have to have flair.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.987
You gotta convey your oddness
through a dapper ensemble.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.156
How do you feel about a cloak?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.825
I wouldn't want them to mistake me
for a wizard.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.786
I don't see how that
would be a bad thing, but...

09:37.869 --> 09:41.706
I just want them to look at my portfolio,

09:41.790 --> 09:44.250
and then make their decision
based on that.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.960
When am I gonna see this bad boy?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.421
If you're referring to my portfolio,
right now.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.673
[massage chair trembling]

09:53.343 --> 09:54.177
Oh, no.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.305
Oh, no. Oh, no!

09:58.223 --> 10:00.100
[shouts] My portfolio, it's not in here.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.435
-It's not in here!
-Okay, deep breath.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.773
Deep breath.
Where was the last place you saw it?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.692
-I don't know! I don't know!
-Don't worry, homie.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.944
Give me your phone.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.281
Oh, you really should
password protect this.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.451
I'm gonna have to mess with you later.
You leave me no choice, but not now.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.662
Now, I am in hero mode.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.957

<i>I'm such an idiot. Goodbye.</i>

10:39.430 --> 10:40.723
Wait, Sam.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.102
Don't worry. We'll find it.

11:12.714 --> 11:13.756
Useless animal.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.052
Why have one washing machine
when you can have two?

11:18.636 --> 11:21.055
Double the clean clothes,
double the fresh looks.

Don't mind her, she's with maintenance,
she's going to fix stuff.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.521
Let me show you something over here.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.567
Hey. Are you okay?

11:34.819 --> 11:38.406
Okay. You want me to read you
Ernest Shackleton's Wikipedia page?

11:41.910 --> 11:42.952
Ready?

11:44.078 --> 11:46.998
"Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton...

11:47.290 --> 11:48.666

11:49.042 --> 11:52.170
who led three British expeditions
to the Antarctic

11:52.587 --> 11:55.924
and one of the principal figures
of the period known as...

11:56.007 --> 11:59.761

He was born on February 15th, 1874,

12:04.224 --> 12:08.228
in Kilkea, near Athy,
County Kildare, Ireland,

12:08.311 --> 12:12.148
about 46 miles, 74 kilometers,
from Dublin."

12:12.523 --> 12:15.151
He's buried on the island
of South Georgia.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.196
In a cemetery next to a wool factory.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.823
Oh! Wool.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.787
Sam, look, we can still fix this.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.997
We just have to find your portfolio.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.334
And we will scour the entire town
if we have to,

12:31.709 --> 12:33.378
starting with Techtropolis.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.129
Okay?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.808
TECHTROPOLIS

12:46.891 --> 12:47.976
You're all good here.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.769
Thing's connected to the thing.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.775
'Kay.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.486
-[people chattering]
-[music playing]

13:06.452 --> 13:07.704
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.664
-Corner table, I like it.
-Yeah.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.958
-How are you?
-Good, good.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.670
Thanks for meeting me.
I'm really excited about this training.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.047
Yeah, me too. It's such a good idea.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.592
So many people are wrapped up in
their own stuff, they don't get involved.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.262
So... I'm impressed with you. [chuckles]

13:25.221 --> 13:27.724
You look nice, where are you headed?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.643
Just meeting a man.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.313
He's tall, reddish hair...

13:33.855 --> 13:35.273
You seen him? [chuckles]

13:35.481 --> 13:37.442
Can I get you two something to drink?

13:37.984 --> 13:40.695
I will have the Pinot Noir.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.198
I'll just have coffee, please.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.616
Thank you.

13:46.743 --> 13:50.121
You might have to cut me off
at two coffees. Sometimes I get crazy.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.332
I might have to use my defibrillator
on myself.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.958
[laughs]

13:55.710 --> 13:59.047
[chuckles and sighs]

14:10.266 --> 14:12.518
-It's not in the girls' bathroom.
-Not in the break room.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.770
Or the stock room.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.063
-Damn.
-I know.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.065
-But... shit.
-I know.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.317
We've searched this whole place,
it's not here.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.568
[mobile phone buzzes]

14:21.069 --> 14:22.570
Who's that? Someone find my portfolio?

14:22.653 --> 14:23.780
No, it's Evan.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.033
I'm supposed to be studying for
my biology test, he's busting my balls.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.035
That's it.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
I know where my portfolio is.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.087
I mean, this place is
really just a big box.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.172
Are you sure
this is the last place you saw it?

14:41.255 --> 14:43.841
Yes. I made a decision
to carry it with me everywhere,

14:43.925 --> 14:45.676
so I wouldn't lose it and I lost it.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.054
No dice.
Lost and found doesn't have it either.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.473
But, I did come up on this sweet amulet.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.560
-Is there anywhere else it could be?
-Here. It has to be here.

14:54.644 --> 14:59.148
I bet somebody found it while they were
blowing off steamÂ and they stole it.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.109
A lot of artists get their work stolen.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.486
It's a common problem.
I watched a documentary about it.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.822
Relax, chipmunk. It's going to be okay.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.742
No, it's not! And why would you
even bring me to this loud place,

15:09.826 --> 15:13.162
with these hurtful balls,
and men in bike shorts?

15:13.496 --> 15:16.290
-What a dumb idea!
-Sam, don't blame Zahid.

15:16.457 --> 15:17.708
He's just trying to help.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.544
Well, maybe I should blame you too.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.046
Because if you
and Evan hadn't got me all worried,

15:22.130 --> 15:24.632
then I wouldn't have needed
to blow off steam in the first place.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.968
Well, maybe you lost your portfolio
on purpose,

15:27.051 --> 15:29.345
because deep down
you're afraid of going to college.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.849
So don't blame everybody else
for your own self-defeating behavior.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.059
It's not self-defeating behavior.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.145
Someone stole my portfolio,

15:37.228 --> 15:39.355
you promised to get it back
and you didn't!

15:39.439 --> 15:40.857
Okay, maybe we should leave.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.401
I think Bike Shorts over there
is eyeing my amulet.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.736
-[yells] Fine!
-Fine! [grunts]

15:46.070 --> 15:48.114
Okay, you know I'm your ride, right?

15:49.407 --> 15:50.575
Just move!

15:52.285 --> 15:54.328
[stammers] What's the matter?
Why slam the door?

15:54.412 --> 15:57.540
You mean, did we spend all day
looking for Sam's dumb portfolio,

15:57.623 --> 15:59.542
even though he lost it on purpose?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.502
-What?
-And I should be studying.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.464
-You lost your portfolio?
-No, it was stolen.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.673
You lost it.

16:05.756 --> 16:10.428
Guys, calm down. Maybe it's at school,
I'll call and see if they can find it.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.929
Let's get in the truck,
retrace your steps.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.681
Not helping. It's gone forever.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.267
-Honey. Sweetheart.
-It's not gone forever.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.894
-We will find it.
-It's gonna be found.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.811
[knocking at door]

16:22.231 --> 16:23.524
-Hey.
-Hi, Doug.

16:23.608 --> 16:27.403
How are you, Megan? What are you--
What are you doing here?

16:27.487 --> 16:30.823
I have something for you.
We have something for you.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.117
Hi. I'm Elsa.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.204
I'm Megan. And this is Amber.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.456
She's in Sam's peer group.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.167
Come in, come in.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.880
Oh. Megan is the social worker
[stammers] I was talking about.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.591
Oh, hi. [chuckles]

16:49.717 --> 16:53.179
I sit next to Sam even though I don't know
what he's talking about half the time.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.015
Yeah, he's a pretty deep thinker,
that's for sure.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.016
Yeah.

16:57.558 --> 17:02.438
Anyway, we have something... for you.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.690
[rustling]

17:06.317 --> 17:07.985
[gasps] You found it!

17:08.945 --> 17:11.030
-Sam, your portfolio!
-They found it.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.156
My portfolio.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.744
Hi, Amber. You look different
than you do in peer group.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.871
-I'm wearing a vest.
-Where'd you find it?

17:18.955 --> 17:20.957
-The vest?
-The portfolio.

17:21.749 --> 17:25.294
After Sam told the peer group
about all the challenges of art school,

17:25.378 --> 17:26.879
Amber got afraid for him

17:26.963 --> 17:30.466
and decided to steal his portfolio,
so that he couldn't go.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.761
[deep breath]
Amber has a lot of empathy. A lot.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.721
You said artists die penniless and alone.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.557
I don't want you to die
penniless and alone.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.851
She realizes now what she did was wrong.

17:40.935 --> 17:41.936
Right, Amber?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.773
-I told you someone stole it.
-Yeah, you were right.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.405
-Why don't you stay and have some cake?
-Yes.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.657
We really should be going.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.450
Okay, then.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.619
But, Mom... cake.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.165
Hey, Sam.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.753
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I guess you weren't being self-defeating.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.798
I think I just thought
that you were doing what I was doing.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.175
But you don't even have a portfolio.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.844
No, I mean, like...

18:16.012 --> 18:18.806
Clayton is really hard,
and I don't love it.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.225
So I think that I've been slacking off

18:21.309 --> 18:23.644
because I want to fail,
so I don't have to go there anymore.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.105
Well, that's dumb.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.065
I know.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.359
Do you want me to help you study
for biology?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.652
Really?

18:32.528 --> 18:33.738
Yeah, that'd be great.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
Okay, after dinner.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.327
-How are you with the Krebs cycle?
-Is that a joke?

18:39.785 --> 18:41.495
Ha. I love it.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.461
STUDYING WITH SAM 2NITE.
THX FOR BUGGING ME.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.462
DON'T DO IT AGAIN

18:49.670 --> 18:51.380
[text alerts whoosh]

18:52.214 --> 18:54.133
[Sam shouts]
What the heck happened to my room?

18:59.263 --> 19:01.265
[phone ringing]

19:01.349 --> 19:02.183
[Myles] <i>Hey.</i>

19:02.266 --> 19:03.559
-Myles?
<i>-Yo.</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:08.481
Oh, hi. So I've been thinking
about this a lot and...

19:08.648 --> 19:13.110
I know it's what people do,
get married to have kids, but...

19:14.236 --> 19:16.906
I just don't think I want to settle.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.784
I think we both deserve something...

19:21.619 --> 19:23.287
[sighs] ...special.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.874
<i>-Cool, cool. I'm in Africa.</i>
<i>-</i>[Julia] <i>What?</i>

19:26.957 --> 19:29.877
I took a job with Doctors without Borders.
I'm gonna be here for two years.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.962
<i>Were you going to tell me?</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:34.090
I'm telling you now.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.178
Okay. Well, I definitely
made the right decision.

19:39.261 --> 19:43.432
Oh, broken clavicle. Nice.
Gotta motor. Text me when the kid's born.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.441
Yep. Daddy's a douchebag.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.489
Can you believe we're sitting here?

19:59.323 --> 20:00.783
College is a big deal.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.451
QUIET
INTERVIEWS IN PROGRESS

20:02.535 --> 20:05.830
It's not college.
It's an interview. It's very different.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.708
I am so proud of you, Sam.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.670
When I get up
and talk about you in group...

20:12.753 --> 20:16.173
Well, it gives parents
with younger children hope

20:16.257 --> 20:18.134
for their future. You're...

20:18.467 --> 20:21.053
You're a real role model. And RISD!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
RISD is huge.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.979
Sam, honey, how you feeling?

20:33.816 --> 20:34.692
Sam?

20:34.817 --> 20:35.901
EXIT

20:37.945 --> 20:41.615
I know you know this, but it's normal
to be nervous around transitions.

20:42.408 --> 20:46.120
I think maybe the idea of moving far away
from home is a little...

20:46.871 --> 20:48.247
-scary.
-You know what?

20:48.330 --> 20:51.625
There's no rule that says
that you have to move far away.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.044
I mean, I did and it massively sucked.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.380
There are plenty of great schools
around here.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.798
In fact...

21:00.968 --> 21:02.052
Denton University,

21:02.136 --> 21:05.473
very close to home and it has
a scientific illustration program.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.894
-Science and art, together?
-Yeah.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.104
And you wouldn't have to move far away.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.523
FUTURE JOB INFORMATION

21:15.733 --> 21:16.734
Ms. Whitaker?

21:17.735 --> 21:21.155
They have a marine life
illustration class. Did you know?

21:21.238 --> 21:22.114
I didn't.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.660
One thing I've learned in this job,
sometimes you find the perfect school...

21:27.203 --> 21:28.954
and sometimes it finds you.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.586
-[keys jangling]
-[sighs]

21:36.337 --> 21:37.463
What are you doing?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.882
Nothing. It's silly.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.220
Fine. I'm making a website.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.182
-You can't even turn on the TV.
-Yes, I can.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.810
If somebody hands me the correct remote.

21:51.727 --> 21:52.937
Anyway, it's just...

21:53.020 --> 21:57.107
It's been inspiring for me to see you
so excited about these trainings,

21:57.191 --> 22:01.237
and I know we're doing it together, but
it still feels more like your thing. So...

22:01.445 --> 22:05.241
I was thinking maybe I could find
something that was more...

22:05.324 --> 22:06.158
me.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.245
That's cool. So, what you got?

22:09.495 --> 22:13.624
Okay, so a while ago,
a mom came into the autism center

22:13.707 --> 22:15.835
and asked me
if I would cut her son's hair.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.254
And I did. And I loved it.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.924
I was just thinking, maybe I could make it
more of a regular thing.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.886
So I'm... I'm building a website.
I know it's dumb.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.431
No, I think that's good.
I think you'll be great at that.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.183
-Yeah?
-I think it's a good idea.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.644
I haven't chopped
any child's ear off yet.

22:33.727 --> 22:34.979
Well, that's a start.

22:35.062 --> 22:39.358
Yeah. Now, I'm trying to come up
with a name for my business.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.527
Okay, so... [clears throat]

22:41.944 --> 22:43.571
What do you think of...

22:43.654 --> 22:45.155
"Hair Today...

22:46.115 --> 22:46.949
Gone Tomorrow."

22:47.741 --> 22:48.909
-That's terrible.
-Okay.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.078
I don't think that's very good.
I think, uh...

22:51.161 --> 22:51.996
I got it.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.291
What about something like,
"Don't Get Snippy"?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.334
-Yeah, that's not good.
-[both laugh]

22:57.418 --> 22:59.420
-It's awful.
-That's worse than yours.

22:59.503 --> 23:04.049
-What else? You have other choices?
-How about "Hair... Spec-trim"?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.010
That's not bad, actually.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.387
-Yes, it is bad.
-It's very bad.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.473
-What about... "Hair You Go"?
-[Elsa laughs]

23:11.724 --> 23:13.642
-Instead of "here you go," it's...
-No!

23:13.726 --> 23:16.061
-No? I thought that was good.
-No, you did not.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.522
No, I didn't. I'm sure you're gonna
come up with a good name.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.607
I think it's a good idea.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.360

23:35.581 --> 23:38.334

23:39.543 --> 23:41.670

you know, maybe we could...

23:51.722 --> 23:53.849
do couples therapy
or something likeÂ that?

23:55.726 --> 23:57.311
-Yeah.
-Maybe.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.863
Okay.
