00:00.845 --> 00:02.213
So, you're probably all wondering

00:02.213 --> 00:04.081
why I called this family meeting.

00:04.081 --> 00:06.150
You have no respect for other people's time

00:06.150 --> 00:08.752
and you like to hear yourself talk?

00:09.687 --> 00:12.756
True, but not why I'm here.

00:12.756 --> 00:14.158
I need to talk to you about the wedding,

00:14.158 --> 00:16.827
and, more importantly, about Brad.

00:16.827 --> 00:19.763
Yes! Okay! Who had them breaking
up Wednesday night at 9:00?

00:19.763 --> 00:21.298
- I said Tuesday!
- I always say go the distance.

00:21.298 --> 00:22.733
Tomorrow!

00:22.733 --> 00:23.968
Wait, wait, wait, hold on!

00:23.968 --> 00:26.804
Did you actually bet on
Brad and I breaking up

00:26.804 --> 00:29.073
and calling off the wedding?

00:30.975 --> 00:34.212
I mean, you guys are a
little on-again off-again.

00:34.312 --> 00:37.319
On, off. On, off, on, off.

00:37.419 --> 00:40.154
I could keep going, but you get it.

00:40.188 --> 00:43.023
I am not breaking up with Brad.

00:43.058 --> 00:44.825
This is exactly what I wanted

00:44.859 --> 00:47.628
to talk to you heartless
pack of delinquents about.

00:47.662 --> 00:49.530
Brad and I are getting married.

00:49.564 --> 00:50.798
He's about to become your father,

00:50.832 --> 00:52.566
and I want you to start
treating him like one.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.668
- You want us to hit him up for money?
- Oh my God.

00:54.702 --> 00:56.703
You know, you're right, mom.

00:56.738 --> 00:58.338
We're sorry. We're being insensitive.

00:58.373 --> 01:00.107
Thank you, Benji.

01:00.141 --> 01:03.343
And if you could learn to say
"you're right, mom" more often,

01:03.378 --> 01:06.113
we could have a lot fewer family meetings.

01:06.147 --> 01:08.182
And we're gonna try to be a lot
more supportive and respectful.

01:08.216 --> 01:10.184
Thank you.

01:10.218 --> 01:11.885
Okay, who wants to change their bets?

01:11.920 --> 01:13.821
It's wide open here.

You know what I what I love mot
mom and Brad getting married?

01:34.075 --> 01:35.943
He's ten years younger
so we're off the hook

01:35.977 --> 01:38.112
for taking care of her when she gets old?

01:39.414 --> 01:42.049
No, it's that they found each other.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.183
They're obviously meant to be.

01:43.218 --> 01:44.284
Meant to be? Pfft.

01:44.319 --> 01:46.019
That's not even a real thing.

01:46.054 --> 01:47.287
If it was, Riley and I would be together

01:47.322 --> 01:49.189
'cause no one is more
meant to be than we are.

01:49.224 --> 01:52.092
Dude, seriously, let it go.

01:52.127 --> 01:54.061
You broke up, twice.

01:54.095 --> 01:56.063
I think the only thing
you're meant to be is over.

01:56.097 --> 01:58.031
Tucker agrees with me, right?

01:58.066 --> 02:00.134
Oh, that we're sick of
you talking about Riley?

02:00.168 --> 02:01.869
Oh, totally.

02:01.903 --> 02:03.103
Thank you.

02:03.138 --> 02:04.304
And what's with the suitcase?

02:04.339 --> 02:07.207
Oh. You know, that time of year again.

02:07.242 --> 02:09.943
TV convention in Detroit.

02:09.978 --> 02:12.045
Worst weekend ever.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.915
And that includes the weekend
I went discount sky-diving.

02:14.949 --> 02:17.184
"Pull the cord!" What cord?

02:17.218 --> 02:19.920
You know?

02:23.024 --> 02:24.191
Hey, Corrie.

02:24.225 --> 02:26.126
You got everything set up?

02:26.161 --> 02:27.261
Awesome.

02:27.295 --> 02:30.898
This is gonna be the best weekend ever.

02:34.936 --> 02:35.969
Hey, Ben.

02:36.004 --> 02:37.905
Danny! Just the man I was looking for.

02:37.939 --> 02:39.373
I would like for you to be my best man.

02:39.407 --> 02:42.943
Your best man? I'm so honored!

02:42.977 --> 02:44.311
Well, you've been such a
great friend and so supportive

02:44.345 --> 02:46.113
of my relationship with your mother,

02:46.147 --> 02:47.915
I thought that you'd be the perfect choice.

02:47.949 --> 02:49.183
Plus mom tried to sleep with your dad

02:49.217 --> 02:50.717
then made out with your brother,

02:50.752 --> 02:52.953
so they're probably off the list.

02:52.987 --> 02:54.688
Yeah, that's too.

02:54.722 --> 02:56.590
But, your first official
duty is to throw me

02:56.624 --> 02:58.492
a wild, crazy, somewhat filthy,

02:58.526 --> 03:00.661
last-night-as-a-single-man bachelor party!

03:00.695 --> 03:02.629
But dignified.

03:02.664 --> 03:04.164
And secret.

03:04.199 --> 03:05.599
Oh! I'm in!

03:05.633 --> 03:07.167
And I'm single again,

03:07.202 --> 03:09.136
so a night out with the boys is perfect.

03:09.170 --> 03:11.338
No stupid girls to distract us.

03:13.908 --> 03:15.842
I think you're kind of missing
the point of this party.

03:17.278 --> 03:18.779
I'll work with him.

03:22.951 --> 03:24.051
So what's the big news?

03:24.085 --> 03:25.852
Oh, it's about the wedding,

03:25.887 --> 03:27.955
and I think you'll be very happy.

03:27.989 --> 03:29.790
I'm bumping you up to maid of honor.

03:29.824 --> 03:31.525
My sister just crapped out.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.528
Really? You can have my sister if you want.

03:34.596 --> 03:36.563
An even duller version of you?

03:36.598 --> 03:38.432
Yeah. No, thanks.

03:38.466 --> 03:40.267
And the first order of business

03:40.301 --> 03:42.236
as my maid of honor is to throw me

03:42.270 --> 03:45.205
a wild, crazy, somewhat filthy,

03:45.240 --> 03:48.308
last-night-as-a-single-woman
bachelorette party.

03:48.343 --> 03:50.877
But dignified and secret.

03:50.912 --> 03:52.112
Hello, ladies.

03:52.146 --> 03:53.213
Mom, guess what.

03:53.248 --> 03:55.048
Brad just made me his best man.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.617
Isn't that awesome?

03:56.651 --> 03:59.686
And your mom just made
me her maid of honor.

03:59.721 --> 04:01.855
Wow. What a day.

04:01.889 --> 04:04.758
And I get to plan the bachelor party.

04:04.792 --> 04:07.361
It's gonna be epic.

04:07.395 --> 04:10.264
I don't think I was
supposed to tell you that.

04:10.298 --> 04:11.331
What?

04:11.366 --> 04:12.399
No!

04:12.433 --> 04:14.301
No, no, no, no!

04:14.335 --> 04:16.103
Do you have any idea what kind of trouble

04:16.137 --> 04:18.305
Brad will get into with
these boys in charge?

04:18.339 --> 04:20.072
But, Mrs. Wheeler, you just asked me...

04:20.108 --> 04:22.276
Riley, when we do it, it's fun and silly.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.811
When they do it, it's perverted.

04:24.846 --> 04:26.346
Gosh, I'll bet they'll have strippers.

04:26.381 --> 04:29.950
Brad has a very hard time saying no
to women who take their clothes off.

04:29.984 --> 04:32.519
Don't ask me how I know.

04:32.553 --> 04:34.688
Ben. Ben, come here.

04:34.722 --> 04:37.491
I just figured out what you can
get me for a wedding present.

04:37.525 --> 04:39.559
I wasn't going to get
you a wedding present.

04:39.594 --> 04:41.528
Well, you are now.

04:41.562 --> 04:44.331
You need to make sure that Brad's
bachelor party is dull and boring.

04:44.365 --> 04:47.467
Meaning no drinking,
no hookers, no lap dances.

04:47.502 --> 04:49.369
Why would I do that?

04:49.404 --> 04:52.306
Seems like the only
person that hurts is me.

04:52.340 --> 04:54.975
Because I'm your mother and I asked you to.

04:56.210 --> 04:58.912
Besides, Ben, I just...

04:58.946 --> 05:02.616
I just really want to start
this relationship out right.

05:02.650 --> 05:06.853
It's not easy finding love again at my age.

05:06.888 --> 05:09.756
I just wish you could be
a little more supportive.

05:09.791 --> 05:12.492
Mom! Mom, calm down! Okay, I'm sorry.

05:12.527 --> 05:15.329
I got it. I'll take care of it, I promise.

05:15.363 --> 05:19.132
And people think Danny's the gullible one.

05:23.237 --> 05:25.906
So I'm thinking, if we use the bar,

05:25.940 --> 05:28.041
we can cut down on cost
and get more strippers.

05:28.076 --> 05:29.843
More strippers?

05:29.877 --> 05:31.011
No strippers. We can't do strippers.

05:31.045 --> 05:32.679
What's wrong with strippers?

05:32.714 --> 05:36.583
Well, for one thing,
everyone of those sweet,

05:36.617 --> 05:37.851
nearly-naked, pole-dancing girls

05:37.885 --> 05:39.619
is someone's daughter.

05:39.654 --> 05:42.422
Oh. You're right.

05:42.457 --> 05:45.292
Never really thought about
where strippers come from.

05:46.494 --> 05:50.063
Guys, look,
I'm sorry I gotta miss the bachelor party,

05:50.098 --> 05:52.032
but I'm off to Detroit.

05:52.066 --> 05:53.333
Hey, if you don't hear
from me in three days

05:53.368 --> 05:54.935
just call the police.

05:54.969 --> 05:56.069
I've been bored to death.

05:56.104 --> 05:58.939
Okay, have fun.

05:58.973 --> 06:00.040
Oh, wait!

06:00.074 --> 06:02.042
I think Tucker forgot his
itinerary in the printer.

06:02.076 --> 06:04.978
Oh! I'll catch him.

06:05.012 --> 06:06.646
Wait.

06:06.681 --> 06:08.749
One round-trip ticket to Las Vegas

06:08.783 --> 06:10.584
and a suite on the strip?

06:10.618 --> 06:11.685
Tucker's going to Vegas?

06:11.719 --> 06:13.387
He lied?

06:13.421 --> 06:14.488
What's in Vegas?

06:14.522 --> 06:16.423
Women, gambling and liquor.

06:16.457 --> 06:18.558
The perfect ingredients for
an amazing bachelor party.

06:18.593 --> 06:20.360
- But you just said...
- I know. Hold on.

06:20.395 --> 06:22.329
I'm having an argument with my conscience.

06:22.363 --> 06:23.397
And he's down!

06:23.431 --> 06:25.399
Danny, that's what we're
doing for Brad's party!

06:25.433 --> 06:26.933
We're going to Vegas!

06:26.968 --> 06:29.169
Emma, we're going to Vegas! Come on!

06:31.072 --> 06:33.774
I managed to convince Danny
to book some cabin-y, woodsy,

06:33.808 --> 06:35.876
middle of nowhere-y something or other.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.077
Honestly, it was so dull,

06:37.111 --> 06:38.879
I nodded off halfway
through the description.

06:38.913 --> 06:41.748
You are a good son.

06:41.783 --> 06:44.418
No phone, no cell, no Internet.

06:44.452 --> 06:47.554
So no point in even trying to
call us to check on our story.

06:47.588 --> 06:49.289
Now, see you guys in a couple days,

06:49.323 --> 06:51.258
you know, if I haven't died from boredom.

06:53.594 --> 06:56.496
God, sounds horrible.

06:56.531 --> 06:59.299
I'm actually starting
to feel sorry for Brad.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.234
Okay, that passed.

07:01.269 --> 07:02.335
So what do you have planned for us?

07:02.370 --> 07:05.839
Okay. So, how do you feel

07:05.873 --> 07:08.708
about a tea party at the
central park boathouse?

07:08.743 --> 07:10.010
Oh!

07:10.044 --> 07:12.779
A tea party at a boathouse?

07:12.814 --> 07:15.982
What am I, five? God, try again!

07:16.017 --> 07:18.452
Hey, did Ben already leave for Vegas?

07:18.486 --> 07:19.753
Vegas?

07:19.787 --> 07:21.388
They went to Vegas?

07:21.422 --> 07:25.325
Now that I say it out loud,
I think it was a secret.

07:28.296 --> 07:30.497
Those rotten, scheming little liars!

07:30.531 --> 07:32.232
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

07:32.266 --> 07:34.034
Good luck, they're just gonna deny it.

07:34.068 --> 07:37.270
You know what? Good idea, Riley.

07:37.305 --> 07:38.905
We need to catch them in the act.

07:38.940 --> 07:41.942
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh. We are going to Vegas!

07:41.976 --> 07:44.177
No, no, no, no. No, not quite what I meant!

07:44.212 --> 07:46.112
Yeah! We're going to Vegas!

07:46.147 --> 07:48.048
Mrs. Wheeler, no!

07:50.000 --> 07:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:06.521 --> 08:07.487
Smell that?

08:07.522 --> 08:10.691
Old smoke, dirty money, and recycled air.

08:10.725 --> 08:12.426
God, I love Vegas!

08:12.460 --> 08:15.162
Well,
before anybody does anything they regret,

08:15.196 --> 08:16.563
and trust me, I will,

08:16.598 --> 08:19.032
I need to drop Emma off
at the Hotel Sitter.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.434
24-hour day care.

08:20.468 --> 08:22.402
Now, that's what I call a family vacation.

08:24.105 --> 08:25.873
Hey, don't you think we should call Tucker

08:25.907 --> 08:27.040
and tell him that we're here?

08:27.075 --> 08:28.809
Uh, no, 'cause then he's gonna stop doing

08:28.843 --> 08:30.077
whatever it is he's doing,
and we won't be able

08:30.111 --> 08:33.046
to mock him for it when
we catch him doing it.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.784
And also my follow spot is off.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.852
If the people can't see me,

08:38.886 --> 08:41.587
they can't fall in love with me.

08:41.623 --> 08:43.789
Oh, Silky.

08:43.825 --> 08:45.792
It's so good to have you back.

08:45.827 --> 08:47.394
I never miss your show.

08:47.428 --> 08:49.363
Oh, thank you, Margaret.

08:49.397 --> 08:52.232
You know,
it's always good to see my regulars.

08:52.267 --> 08:55.235
You know,
I hear Sinatra lost his virginity to her.

08:58.139 --> 09:00.007
You hear that?

09:00.041 --> 09:04.011
Roulette wheels,
slot machines and broken dreams.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.746
God, I love Vegas!

09:05.780 --> 09:08.882
All right, let's go find those
idiots and send them packing.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.818
Oh, my God!

09:11.853 --> 09:13.754
Look at that.

09:13.788 --> 09:16.590
Peter Oliver, Las Vegas' greatest magician,

09:16.624 --> 09:18.725
is performing on the main stage.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.494
I have seen him three times.

09:20.528 --> 09:21.728
He's amazing.

09:21.763 --> 09:24.264
He once made my bra disappear.

09:24.299 --> 09:26.533
You know, that's not
really much of a trick.

09:30.371 --> 09:32.139
Hey, mom,
just wanted to let you know we made it.

09:32.173 --> 09:35.943
Cell service is pretty bad here,
so it might cut...

09:37.178 --> 09:39.746
now there's an ass I'll never forget.

09:39.781 --> 09:41.615
Uhh!

09:42.817 --> 09:44.584
Riley? What are you doing here?

09:44.619 --> 09:45.886
Aren't you supposed to
be at home with my mom?

09:45.920 --> 09:47.554
Oh, I'm with your mom.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.523
Yeah, your bartender filled us in.

09:49.557 --> 09:51.425
Oh, my God, my mother's here?

09:51.459 --> 09:52.793
Um, any way you can cover for us

09:52.827 --> 09:55.395
and tell her that he got it all
wrong and we're not really here?

09:55.430 --> 09:57.397
And why would I do that?

09:57.432 --> 10:02.102
I just spent six hours on a
plane with your mother, okay?

10:02.136 --> 10:04.104
I have absolutely no intention...

10:04.138 --> 10:05.906
I'll get you out of being
her maid of honor.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.174
Deal. Never saw you.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.109
Cool. Um, so we'll just split the strip.

10:09.143 --> 10:10.944
We'll never see each other.
You want north or south?

10:10.979 --> 10:13.046
I will take south.

10:13.081 --> 10:15.615
Wait, no, there's nothing fun south,
is there?

10:15.650 --> 10:16.950
No.

10:16.985 --> 10:19.419
You gambled and you lost.
That's Vegas for you.

10:19.454 --> 10:21.788
Here's to not seeing you around.

10:24.292 --> 10:27.327
Here's to "Brad the pad"
becoming "Brad the stepdad"

10:27.362 --> 10:29.363
and "Brad the granddad."

10:29.397 --> 10:31.098
Dude, in just one engagement,

10:31.132 --> 10:33.300
you've aged yourself two generations.

10:34.469 --> 10:36.269
Yo! What are you guys doing in here?

10:36.304 --> 10:38.038
I said meet me outside the north entrance.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.107
We can't be here. It's too south...

10:40.141 --> 10:41.141
Of where all the action is.

10:41.175 --> 10:42.743
Come on, let's go.

10:42.777 --> 10:44.911
God! You know what?

10:44.946 --> 10:46.613
Change of plans. What's the rush?

10:46.647 --> 10:49.549
We never sit and just talk.

10:49.584 --> 10:51.518
And you searched the entire hotel?

10:51.552 --> 10:53.587
Yep, and they are definitely not here.

10:53.621 --> 10:56.490
But-but we should head south.
South seems right.

10:56.524 --> 10:58.191
Yeah. Yeah, south is good.

10:58.226 --> 10:59.593
Definitely. Definitely south.

10:59.627 --> 11:02.396
Okay, Rain Man, I got it. South. Jeez.

11:04.232 --> 11:10.103
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

11:10.138 --> 11:11.972

11:12.006 --> 11:14.641

11:27.255 --> 11:29.122
- Bonnie?
- Brad?

11:29.157 --> 11:30.290
What are you doing here?

11:30.324 --> 11:32.225
I believe catching you in the act

11:32.260 --> 11:33.326
of being a lying jerk!

11:33.361 --> 11:34.361
How could you?

11:34.395 --> 11:36.129
Come on, Bonnie, it's one night!

11:36.164 --> 11:37.831
You couldn't let me have one night?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.000
Oh, okay, you know,
you can have all the nights you want!

11:40.034 --> 11:41.101
What's that supposed to mean?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.003
It means if you can lie to me like this,

11:43.037 --> 11:44.738
maybe we shouldn't get married!

11:44.772 --> 11:45.972
Hey! Hey! Pipe down!

11:46.007 --> 11:48.842
Can't you see Silky is singing?

11:48.876 --> 11:52.579
Why don't you scurry on back to
"The Golden Girls" convention?

12:02.123 --> 12:03.190
I don't know them!

12:04.358 --> 12:06.927
I thank you all so much!

12:09.293 --> 12:10.527
What is wrong with you people?

12:10.561 --> 12:13.230
I mean, is there anything
you don't know how to ruin?

12:13.264 --> 12:15.131
Dude, what was up with that?

12:15.166 --> 12:16.299
Yeah, why didn't you tell us?

12:18.269 --> 12:19.903
Well, do you guys want the whole story?

12:19.937 --> 12:21.037
Yeah, we do.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.740
Okay, when I was eight,
I went to space camp...

12:26.077 --> 12:27.878
A little less.

12:27.912 --> 12:30.614
Okay. Um, on my 13th birthday...

12:30.648 --> 12:31.648
Are you kidding me?

12:31.682 --> 12:32.716
Still less.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.851
Hey, for the last five years,

12:34.886 --> 12:36.786
I've been coming to Vegas for a weekend

12:36.821 --> 12:40.323
and living out my dream
of being a lounge singer.

12:40.358 --> 12:42.425
I didn't want to tell you
'cause I knew you'd make fun of me.

12:42.460 --> 12:43.493
That's not true.

12:43.528 --> 12:46.930
We would never make fun of you... Silky.

12:46.964 --> 12:48.198
See? Oh, my...

12:48.232 --> 12:50.200
hey, guys, Tucker's right.

12:50.234 --> 12:52.202
We don't support each other like we should.

12:52.236 --> 12:55.171
And you two,
you don't trust each other like you should.

12:55.206 --> 12:57.007
There is no "us two" anymore.

12:57.041 --> 12:59.075
But you're meant to be.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.011
He's right.

13:01.045 --> 13:03.880
I don't need strippers and
hookers and dirty women.

13:03.915 --> 13:05.815
I have you.

13:08.386 --> 13:09.686
Oh, Brad.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.721
That's exactly what you
said on our first date.

13:13.424 --> 13:15.325
I love you so much.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.394
Yes!

13:17.428 --> 13:19.195
And I'm still maid of honor.

13:19.230 --> 13:21.031
Hooray.

13:21.065 --> 13:23.333
Okay, what about this?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.335
The boys and girls just go out separately,

13:25.369 --> 13:27.871
maybe have a few drinks, catch a show,

13:27.905 --> 13:29.239
and then we'll all meet up
for brunch in the morning.

13:29.273 --> 13:31.107
That sounds like a perfect plan.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.877
There's no reason for us to go crazy.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.752
Oh, what the hell happened last night?

13:44.488 --> 13:46.256
I know we had drinks.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.258
I remember drinks.

13:49.594 --> 13:51.494
And Elvis.

13:51.529 --> 13:54.164
Yeah, Elvis was definitely there.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.969
And a dolphin.

13:59.971 --> 14:01.071
Morning.

14:01.105 --> 14:02.939
Honeymoon breakfast for the newlyweds.

14:02.974 --> 14:04.808
Uh, sorry, dude, you've got the wrong room.

14:04.842 --> 14:05.875
No one here got married.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.078
Really? That one should check his finger.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.783
Why am I wearing a ring?

14:13.818 --> 14:15.919
Did I marry that stripper?

14:15.953 --> 14:17.654
I married that stripper, didn't I?

14:17.688 --> 14:21.424
God, I have a problem with
saying no to naked women!

14:21.459 --> 14:22.659
Hey!

14:22.693 --> 14:25.528
Does anyone know why I'm
wearing a wedding ring?

14:28.466 --> 14:31.134
You married that guy.

14:32.336 --> 14:34.871
I married my stepdad?

14:34.905 --> 14:39.142
Okay, okay,
this still doesn't explain the dolphin.

14:39.176 --> 14:42.679
Your stepdad? That's a new one.

14:42.713 --> 14:45.615
And this is Vegas. I'm gonna go.

14:45.650 --> 14:46.750
We're married?

14:46.784 --> 14:48.585
No, no, no, no, this is not happening.

14:48.619 --> 14:49.786
I'm meeting your mother in half an hour.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.621
She will notice that I am married!

14:51.656 --> 14:52.756
We'll deal with this later, okay?

14:52.790 --> 14:54.457
Just lose the ring for now.

14:54.492 --> 14:56.426
Right, right. Lose the ring.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.528
Uhh.

14:58.562 --> 15:00.230
It's stuck! The ring is stuck!

15:00.264 --> 15:02.365
Here. Pull.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.100
Pull!

15:08.439 --> 15:14.144
I see you won the
"who gets to stay in the bed" coin toss.

15:14.178 --> 15:16.112
What happened last night?

15:16.147 --> 15:18.214
Not a clue.

15:18.249 --> 15:21.051
Oh, my God, what time is it?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.654
Aah!

15:24.689 --> 15:25.622
Aah!

15:26.957 --> 15:30.560
Ah. This is why I never drink with fans.

15:30.594 --> 15:32.595
Oh, right.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.330
We went to see a magician.

15:38.335 --> 15:40.470
Okay, we have a "good news,
bad news" situation

15:40.504 --> 15:42.172
pretty sure I know what the bad news is.

15:42.206 --> 15:44.040
I married my fiancee's son.

15:44.075 --> 15:46.076
I found a locksmith
willing to open his shop

15:46.110 --> 15:47.277
and saw that ring off your finger.

15:47.311 --> 15:48.912
We just gotta be there in 15 minutes.

15:48.946 --> 15:51.081
You just said "saw" and
"finger" in the same sentence.

15:51.115 --> 15:53.183
I'm going to need a shot.

15:53.217 --> 15:55.118
I managed to find a locksmith.

15:55.152 --> 15:57.987
He said he'll be there
for the next 15 minutes.

15:58.022 --> 15:59.756
You're a magician!

15:59.790 --> 16:01.958
How could you not know how
to get out of handcuffs?

16:01.992 --> 16:04.561
I know how to get out of my handcuffs.

16:04.595 --> 16:05.562
These are yours.

16:05.596 --> 16:07.864
Bonnie! Bonnie!

16:07.898 --> 16:09.466
- Hey!
- Hey!

16:09.500 --> 16:11.401
Get over here, you.

16:14.438 --> 16:18.141
Wait, aren't you Peter Oliver?

16:18.175 --> 16:19.476
I'm Silky Dobbs,

16:19.510 --> 16:21.211
the other headliner here.

16:23.114 --> 16:24.180
Yeah, I know.

16:24.215 --> 16:26.950
My mom Margaret won't shut up about you.

16:26.984 --> 16:29.953
Uh, yeah,
we went to Peter's show last night,

16:29.987 --> 16:33.757
and he gives a tour to
everyone he saws in half.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.759
So, this is the lobby.

16:39.597 --> 16:40.597
Well, this was fun.

16:40.631 --> 16:42.699
Uh, we'll see you guys
at brunch in an hour.

16:42.733 --> 16:43.833
Okay, bye.

16:43.868 --> 16:45.468
We'll see you in a bit.

16:45.503 --> 16:47.403
Okay, then. Bye-bye now.

16:48.606 --> 16:50.573
You know,
usually when someone says "bye, now"

16:50.608 --> 16:52.542
there's a lot more movement than this.

16:52.576 --> 16:56.479
Well! I see the newlyweds
are out and about.

16:56.514 --> 16:59.249
I guess you got over the whole
"marrying your stepdad" thing.

16:59.283 --> 17:00.917
What are you talking abut?

17:00.951 --> 17:03.219
Yeah, this one married the big one.

17:03.254 --> 17:05.088
You married my son?

17:05.122 --> 17:06.156
I swear it is not true.

17:06.190 --> 17:08.124
Oh, really?

17:08.159 --> 17:09.959
Then why are you wearing a wedding ring?

17:09.993 --> 17:13.061
Oh, my God, I've turned another one!

17:13.097 --> 17:15.732
No, it was a big drunken mistake.

17:15.766 --> 17:16.933
That's exactly what Ray said!

17:16.967 --> 17:19.702
But, mom, mom,
it's not like we exchanged vows

17:19.737 --> 17:21.570
and a super romantic ceremony.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.473
Actually, you did.

17:23.507 --> 17:25.642
I found the video on my phone.

17:25.675 --> 17:26.675
Uh, Mrs. Wheeler,

17:26.710 --> 17:29.379
why don't you take a nice 15-mimute walk

17:29.413 --> 17:31.080
and think about this?

17:31.115 --> 17:32.348
You know, don't get handcuffed

17:32.383 --> 17:34.083
to any kind of reaction.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.953
Oh. Right. Um, you know what?

17:36.987 --> 17:38.221
Good idea.

17:38.255 --> 17:40.023
Excuse me,

17:40.057 --> 17:43.092
but you're not allowed to
take these from the hotel.

17:43.127 --> 17:45.161
Ta-da!

17:45.196 --> 17:48.965
Would you believe this is
the end of a very long trick?

17:48.999 --> 17:51.935
Why are you handcuffed to another man?

17:53.537 --> 17:57.440
Okay, um, Brad, I can explain.

17:57.474 --> 17:58.675
It was Riley's fault.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.344
Yeah, she's the one who told
me to go up on stage...

18:01.378 --> 18:03.413
absolutely none of this is my fault.

18:03.447 --> 18:04.547
This is all Ben's fault.

18:04.582 --> 18:07.417
My fault? The best man's in
charge of the bachelor party.

18:07.451 --> 18:09.252
Wait, hey, hey,
we never would have come to Vegas

18:09.286 --> 18:10.253
if it wasn't for Tucker.

18:10.287 --> 18:11.321
Hold up, this is not my fault.

18:22.199 --> 18:23.933
What are you guys laughing about?

18:23.968 --> 18:25.802
This!

18:25.836 --> 18:28.705
I mean, this is typical us.

18:28.739 --> 18:30.773
Don't look now, but I married your son.

18:30.808 --> 18:33.710
No worries.
I'm just handcuffed to another man!

18:33.744 --> 18:36.446
I mean, who does that?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.281
Us.

18:38.315 --> 18:39.515
- We do.
- We do.

18:41.318 --> 18:43.419
Yes, and this is not awkward.

18:43.454 --> 18:47.090
This I gonna be the best
wedding story ever.

18:47.124 --> 18:48.291
I'd still like to get out of these.

18:48.325 --> 18:50.159
- Let me get a picture first.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:50.194 --> 18:52.929
Oh, all right.

18:52.963 --> 18:54.230
Maybe they really are meant to be.

18:54.265 --> 18:55.231
Told you.

18:55.266 --> 18:58.101
Hey, you guys look familiar.

18:58.135 --> 19:00.703
Were you the ones trying
to steal my dolphin?

19:00.738 --> 19:03.006
That's where we saw it!

19:08.779 --> 19:11.714
Okay, baby, home sweet home.

19:13.584 --> 19:14.984
I can't wait for you to start talking

19:15.019 --> 19:19.489
so I can find out where the
hell you got this outfit.

19:19.523 --> 19:21.758
You know what, Danny? You were right.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.726
There is such a thing as "meant to be."

19:23.761 --> 19:26.529
If mom and Brad can make it work
after all they've been through,

19:26.563 --> 19:28.231
maybe Riley and I can make it work, too.

19:28.265 --> 19:30.266
Oh, my God, dude,

19:30.301 --> 19:32.201
can you please just get over it?

19:32.236 --> 19:34.504
No, I can't just pretend I
don't have feelings for her.

19:34.538 --> 19:36.205
Yeah, you can.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.273
You wouldn't know.

19:37.308 --> 19:39.208
Trust me, I know.

19:39.243 --> 19:41.577
I just... I wish Riley and I...

19:41.612 --> 19:43.413
Ben, for the last time,

19:43.447 --> 19:44.614
there is no "Riley and you."

19:44.648 --> 19:46.582
How can you say that to me?

19:46.617 --> 19:50.320
Because I've been in love
with her my entire life.

19:50.354 --> 19:52.488
And I think she loves me, too.

19:55.259 --> 19:57.260
Well, congratulations.

19:57.294 --> 19:59.295
I hope you're very happy together.

19:59.330 --> 20:01.297
Come here.

20:11.274 --> 20:13.308
"Ride away" (By Roy Rrbison begins to play)

20:13.344 --> 20:19.216
<i>♪ It's perfect for a flying
honeymoon they say ♪</i>

20:19.250 --> 20:24.521
<i>♪ so come fly with me,

20:24.555 --> 20:29.326

20:31.296 --> 20:33.096
Oh!

20:33.131 --> 20:34.398
Whoo!

20:34.432 --> 20:37.067
Thank you, Margaret.

20:37.101 --> 20:38.268
Hey, same time next year?

20:38.303 --> 20:40.470
Why wait?

20:44.442 --> 20:46.476
What?
