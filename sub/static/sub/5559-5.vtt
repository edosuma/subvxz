WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:05.506
(man whistling,
thunder crashing)

00:24.792 --> 00:26.694
(thudding nearby)

00:32.433 --> 00:35.169
(thunder crashes)

00:43.711 --> 00:46.547
Anybody there?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.682
(loud thud)

00:50.851 --> 00:54.122
Hello?

00:56.357 --> 00:58.192
(beeping)

00:59.327 --> 01:02.163
(quietly):
Ah, shut that off.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.469
(gun clicks)

01:13.574 --> 01:16.144
No! No! No!

01:33.861 --> 01:36.397
AGATHA:
Can you see it?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.200
What am I looking at?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.634
Our future.

01:40.668 --> 01:44.572
Plans for a new
containment system.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.474
A milk bath, Arthur.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.310
More advanced than the one
that held us during Precrime.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.811
This file's ten years old.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.313
Because the program
was abolished

01:52.346 --> 01:53.547
before they could
move us into it.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.383
"They"?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.417
The feds.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.452
Defense Intelligence Agency.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.654
They had bigger things
in mind for us

02:00.688 --> 02:02.356
than just stopping
local murders in D.C.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.724
Like National Security?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.393
We were going to be
their secret weapon.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.861
But the project was halted
when they set us free.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.230
So that's a good thing.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.764
Only if it stays that way.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.533
This is what I've been seeing

02:12.566 --> 02:15.303
in my vision, Arthur, every day

02:15.336 --> 02:16.670
since Dash went
back to the city

02:16.704 --> 02:18.206
and started working
with that cop.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.208
You asked me to stop
helping them and I did.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.276
That isn't enough.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.912
What do you think I am?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.447
A realist.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.216
Unlike your brother.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.685
She will betray us, Arthur.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.720
You don't know that.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.854
I see it.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.789
What I see is ancient history.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.425
Yes.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.361
But when we're too blind
to learn its lessons,

02:40.394 --> 02:42.830
history repeats.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.703
Knew I'd regret giving you
your own key, Mom.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.573
Yeah, you probably should've
thought that one through.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.707
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.743
Made your favorite.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.745
Algae and palm frittata.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.480
I can't.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.682
Blake's giving a tour
to some bigwig fed today.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.352
Wants everyone
at the precinct early.
Oh.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.987
Maybe we could plan a little
get-together for tonight.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.689
You know, something simple.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.491
Just friends and family?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.859
I-I probably have to work late.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.461
I love you.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.998
You plan on going the
whole day avoiding this.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.268
If people will let me.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.673
(indistinct chatter)

03:33.414 --> 03:35.383
Happy birthday.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.550
Where am I gonna put those?

03:36.584 --> 03:37.551
In water.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.019
With protein, I'm told.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.288
I'm a cop, Dash.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.655
Would you give flowers to Blake?

03:41.689 --> 03:42.990
Well, I don't
know him very well.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.625
When is his birthday?

03:44.658 --> 03:45.959
(sighs)

03:45.993 --> 03:46.994
It's just I'm not,

03:47.027 --> 03:48.796
I'm not big on birthdays.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.931
What?
I love them.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.766
Of course,
I've only really had ten

03:52.800 --> 03:54.702
while technically conscious.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.604
They're very nice.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.872
Thank you.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.040
Hey, Vega.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.675
Your prom night?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.311
You want to eat them?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.618
Yeah.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.653
I won't make
that mistake again.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.021
It's not your fault.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.557
Vega and her dad
share the same birthday.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.791
Standing ten feet away.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.560
Not in Boston.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.629
Well, he should know
why you're being a bitch.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.931
I'm sorry.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.699
Don't be.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.967
She's right.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.736
It's been 17 years

04:28.769 --> 04:31.439
and sometimes it feels like
it was just yesterday.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.873
They never caught
the guy who did it.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.074
"17 years."

04:34.107 --> 04:35.509
Think Precrime would've been up

04:35.543 --> 04:36.810
and running in eight months.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.346
You would've seen it.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.582
What?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.484
Well, Precrime didn't start

04:43.517 --> 04:45.986
until September of '48
officially,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.755
but they had the three of us
in secret testing

04:47.788 --> 04:48.922
a year before that.

04:48.956 --> 04:49.957
For a year?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.593
Narcissist incoming.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.596
(indistinct chatter)

04:55.629 --> 04:57.631
Detective Vega?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.900
Henry Blomfeld,
Deputy Director of the D.I.A.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.370
Nice to meet you.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.671
Her Hawk-Eye analyst, Dash.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.006
Vega?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.007
Walk with us?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.008
Oh, it's okay.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.377
Aw, you really should.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.778
I'm fascinating company.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.917
And I'm Akeela.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.586
Pleasure.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.554
(bracelet buzzing)
Uh...

05:20.588 --> 05:22.556
uh-oh.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.625
BLOMFELD: I was just telling
your lieutenant

05:24.658 --> 05:26.727
how impressed I was with
Hawk-Eye's numbers this month.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.596
He tells me you're
partly responsible.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.863
Thank you.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.400
But Lieutenant Blake
is just being modest.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.901
It's all him...
and Hawk-Eye.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.803
I don't think so.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.505
You've got a clearance rate
four times higher than average.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.839
And all on Class One homicides.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.774
You should take
the victory lap, Detective.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.710
You've earned it.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.077
Mr. Blomfeld has
invited us both

05:44.111 --> 05:46.714
to, uh, come by the
agency this afternoon.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.682
I told him we'd
be honored.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.520
Vega?

05:52.553 --> 05:54.788
Thanks for the invitation,

05:54.822 --> 05:56.524
but you're the politician, Will.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.759
I'll stick
to catching the bad guys.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.127
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Director.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.496
You as well, Detective.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.499
(ticking)

06:05.533 --> 06:08.769
(scream)

06:10.203 --> 06:12.806
VEGA:
Play it back.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.775
Frame by frame.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.812
(ticking)

06:18.846 --> 06:21.482
What's that ticking sound?

06:21.515 --> 06:22.916
Is that a clock?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.885
It's all I could hear
before the scream.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.157
Okay, so it looks like
the murder happens indoors.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.925
I can't tell
if it's day or night.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.764
Two gunshots.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.165
Messy, not calculated.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.200
This happens in the moment.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.802
No faces,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.472
no identifiable markings.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.007
Hold it.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.747
What is it?

06:53.781 --> 06:57.117
It's a 2019 Red Clouds jersey.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.720
It's the year that
they changed their name.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.921
It's almost impossible to get.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.790
Believe me, I've tried.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.592
Well, if it's rare,
maybe we can get

07:04.625 --> 07:06.760
Akeela to run
the purchase records.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.928
(clears his throat)

07:09.597 --> 07:11.899
Wally, one more thing.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.067
Dash said he was
in the milk bath

07:14.101 --> 07:15.503
a year before they
started Precrime.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.637
Beta testing.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.606
Working out the kinks.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.608
We were instructed

07:20.641 --> 07:22.610
to record everything
the Precogs saw,

07:22.643 --> 07:25.112
matching up their future visions
to the deaths that followed.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.882
But we weren't legally
able to act yet.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.218
Worst year of my life.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.589
Mine, too.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.891
Why?
What happened?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.893
Oh, Vega--
If someone was
murdered that year,

07:39.927 --> 07:41.595
and they didn't
catch the killer,

07:41.629 --> 07:43.797
are those visions
recorded somewhere?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.599
(sighs)

07:45.633 --> 07:47.234
Maybe, but-but I doubt it.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.703
After Precrime ended,
the feds pretty much

07:49.737 --> 07:51.539
stripped everything,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.807
covering their asses.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.544
I can ask
one of my old buddies, though,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.679
if you want me to poke around.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.081
No, it was a long shot.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.684
Thanks, Wally.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.790
Oh, thank God.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.959
Blake made me walk
that stick-up-his-ass fed

08:11.992 --> 08:13.694
through Hawk-Eye's protocols.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.228
All 49 of them.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.897
I need some action.
Then you're in luck.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.131
We need you to
run a purchase.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.101
Hit me.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.970
Vintage 2019 Red Clouds jersey.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.140
Very funny, Vega.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.109
Am I missing something?

08:29.142 --> 08:31.178
Yes, the whole concept
of a birthday surprise.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.981
Which I guess is impossible now
that you're working with a--

08:34.014 --> 08:35.849
(whispers):
a Precog.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.154
I knew you'd
been eyeing one,

08:41.188 --> 08:43.691
so I got it for
your birthday.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.003
You like?

08:57.170 --> 09:00.007
Vega, you're the victim.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.143
AKEELA:
Victim?

09:12.219 --> 09:13.921
Is anyone angry at you?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.255
Someone who might be
holding a grudge?

09:15.288 --> 09:16.924
Well, I was
dismissive of my partner

09:16.957 --> 09:18.659
after he gave me flowers.
He might be insulted.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.827
This isn't funny, Vega.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.361
I'm a homicide cop.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.363
The line of people pissed
at me starts on the left.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.133
Relax, they made 500
of those jerseys.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.935
So?

09:27.968 --> 09:30.070
So we didn't see my face
in the murder vision.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.340
which means, at worst,
I have a one in 500 chance

09:33.373 --> 09:35.108
of being murdered in
the next few days.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.144
Well, don't pursue this
and it's almost zero.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.880
Dash, we're gonna
stop this one

09:39.913 --> 09:41.381
just like
we stopped the others.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.283
I'm gonna go see Arthur.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.687
In the meantime,
burn that jersey.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.693
What do you know?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.062
Apparently someone doesn't want
Vega to see her next birthday.

09:57.665 --> 10:00.067
I'm not in the mood
for glib today.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.135
And I wasn't in the
market for a fat lip.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.137
Why didn't you call me
when you got Vega's name?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.139
Because of Agatha?

10:06.173 --> 10:08.241
Because she saw a milk bath
in her vision?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.843
Because she found one.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.252
The feds had plans for us
when Precrime ended.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.320
Maybe still do.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.755
They set us free.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.023
Minds change.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.191
And hearts.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.425
Even if that's true,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.060
nobody knows where we are.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.233
Except Vega.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.708
I didn't get another name.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.780
Laura Vega--
that's all I know.

10:46.814 --> 10:50.283
If you're lying to me...

10:50.317 --> 10:53.787
You can always punch me
in the face again.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.028
I can't believe
I bought you that jersey.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.396
VEGA:
Forget about it.
Look, I was thinking...

11:03.430 --> 11:05.933
I got you a death shirt
for your birthday.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.334
I'm the worst
friend ever.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.236
Akeela...

11:09.269 --> 11:10.437
any details from
the murder vision?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.839
Did anything pop?

11:11.872 --> 11:14.742
I don't know. Maybe.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.143
What about
these arrows?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.878
That's the logo for Revive.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.146
It's a program based

11:19.179 --> 11:20.347
out of Hayward
Correctional Facility,

11:20.380 --> 11:22.349
headed up
by Dana Winter.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.885
They specialize
in inmate rehabilitation.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.387
Well, I'm guessing
the rehab didn't take.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.956
Okay, how long
will it take you

11:28.989 --> 11:30.157
to pull up the files
on the prisoners?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.391
I was gonna
grab some lunch.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.361
Well, okay.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.864
Let's see if
anyone here

11:36.897 --> 11:39.166
has had Lara Vega
as their arresting officer.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.268
Oop! Got a bite.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.004
Michael Wynn.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.372
Sprawl gang leader.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.774
He was into
selling Clarity.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.108
And women.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.043
Didn't much like
being arrested by one.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.413
You need to piss off.
You need to get...

11:53.446 --> 11:55.215
Oh, I don't think so,
little lady.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.784
(grunting)

11:58.218 --> 12:00.187
Ah! Ah! You're dead!

12:00.220 --> 12:01.454
You hear me, you little...

12:01.488 --> 12:04.792
Let's start there.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.094
DASH:
You really think
Wynn could be the guy?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.396
Y-You busted him
almost six years ago.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.131
Psychos have good memories

12:11.164 --> 12:13.166
and this one used to send me
death threats every Christmas.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.367
But he's in prison.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.803
How does he get out to hurt you?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.304
People on the inside
have a lot of reach.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.839
Anyway, that's what
we're gonna find out.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.040
Yeah, but see...

12:20.073 --> 12:21.875
what if that's
just it?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.177
What if going to see Wynn
is what gets you killed?

12:24.211 --> 12:26.413
This isn't one of our
normal cases, Vega.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.447
This is you.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.982
Cops deal in life or death

12:29.016 --> 12:30.317
every day.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.319
Occupational hazard.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.188
I know that better than anyone.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.859
Listen...

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
I've been probing my brain.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.429
Trying to access
that part of my memory,

12:42.462 --> 12:43.931
to just remember something.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.165
Anything.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.568
I don't.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.337
I'm sorry.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.240
It's not your fault.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.508
But this would be.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.944
You would be.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.246
I should do this alone.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.447
Wynn is unarmed,

13:00.480 --> 13:01.915
in a room full of guards.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.016
Besides,

13:03.050 --> 13:04.251
I took him down once.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.485
I can do it again.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.561
(indistinct chatter)

13:14.594 --> 13:16.196
If I'm late for work again,
you're gonna have

13:16.229 --> 13:17.865
to call my boss...

13:17.865 --> 13:19.466
...for the last hour
with my food.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.234
I better get a refund.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.270
I am not paying
for cold moo shu.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.938
WOMAN:
60 years ago,

13:24.972 --> 13:26.306
companies outsourced
all this stuff abroad.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.875
Killed the working class,

13:27.908 --> 13:29.910
causing incarceration rates
to skyrocket.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.013
Now, we give the working class
their jobs back,

13:33.046 --> 13:34.581
only this time, behind bars,

13:34.614 --> 13:36.950
for two cents on the dollar.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.185
Doesn't
seem right.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.053
I'll save my
crocodile tears

13:40.087 --> 13:41.454
for the victims
and their families.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.091
We don't forget the victims,
Detective.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.361
These are our reminders

13:48.395 --> 13:51.064
of past victims,
past crimes...

13:51.098 --> 13:54.067
life-changing mistakes.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.237
It also helps them move on
to more productive lives.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.940
Because all it takes
is an arts and crafts project.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.043
I know you have history
with Michael Wynn

14:03.076 --> 14:05.578
and I'll admit,
he's not an easy case.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.647
but he is trying.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.984
We believe he may be
about to commit a serious crime.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.987
According to data patterns
in our Hawk-Eye system.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.655
Right.
According to data patterns

14:15.688 --> 14:17.958
in the Hawk-Eye system.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.159
WINTER:
That's impossible.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.028
Michael is closely surveilled,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.229
like all our inmates,

14:22.262 --> 14:23.931
especially on our excursions.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.399
You let them outside?

14:26.433 --> 14:28.035
Well, it's good to know
I'm busting my ass

14:28.068 --> 14:29.302
sending criminals
to sleep away camp.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.204
We go on weekly outings

14:31.238 --> 14:34.107
to restaurants,
parks, museums.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.542
Tomorrow, in fact.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.480
That must be how he gets to you.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.350
Shall we?

14:49.456 --> 14:50.991
Detective Vega.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.460
Heard you might be stopping by
for a visit.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.962
I'm touched.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.163
Don't be.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.664
Who's he?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.432
New partner?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.168
Oh, I'm jealous.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.602
We're here on business.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.504
Well, I thought
you just missed me.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.705
I do.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.440
Especially your
Christmas greetings.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.276
Decided to give that up.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.978
Changed man, Detective.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.512
Really?

15:12.545 --> 15:15.215
'Cause something tells me
I've been on your mind.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.716
Not really.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.185
Sometimes, late at night,

15:18.218 --> 15:20.020
when I'm...
Go ahead.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.221
Finish the sentence.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.422
See if the feeling's mutual.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.457
So you're here to flirt.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.393
And reminisce.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.161
About the night
I took you down.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.997
Remember that?

15:30.030 --> 15:33.000
Your face
in the pavement.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.301
My knee
in your chest.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.602
Good times.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.270
You're digging up
ancient history.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.471
VEGA:
Do your boys here

15:38.505 --> 15:40.007
know about
our history?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.208
That you got beat up

15:41.241 --> 15:42.342
by a former high
school cheerleader?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.011
Hmm.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.179
People here just care about
the present, Detective.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.514
The here and now.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.116
Is that why
you want revenge?

15:49.149 --> 15:50.583
Put a hit out on me

15:50.617 --> 15:52.519
to get back the respect
of your friends inside?

15:52.552 --> 15:55.355
I keep the past
where it belongs.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.024
(buzzer sounds)

15:57.057 --> 16:00.193
Are you finished here,
Detective?

16:00.227 --> 16:01.594
Chow time.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.030
Stick around.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.664
I got all the time in the world.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.400
It was nice catching up.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.573
Good job.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.375
Housebroken.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.377
Like a poodle.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.412
Vega, watch out!

16:19.446 --> 16:21.114
(shouts)

16:23.650 --> 16:26.186
WINTER:
Guards!
(grunting)

16:28.288 --> 16:30.423
That's two out of three.
Want to go best out of seven?

16:30.457 --> 16:31.524
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:31.558 --> 16:33.726
She set me up.
She set me up!

16:33.760 --> 16:35.728
Vega, this isn't over!
You hear me...?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.764
You baited him.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.799
He attacked me, Ms. Winter.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.469
And from the looks of it, he
lost his field trip privileges.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.478
Who put this here?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.813
I don't know.
Prisoners are allowed

16:53.846 --> 16:55.482
to put things here anonymously.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.284
It... could have been anyone
over the past ten years.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.087
Vega, what is it?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.389
Excuse me,
please.
What's wrong?

17:02.422 --> 17:03.556
You got Wynn.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.125
They won't let him go

17:05.158 --> 17:06.259
on any more excursions--
it's over, right?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.495
Wynn's not the killer.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.097
What?

17:10.097 --> 17:11.298
How do you know that?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.567
Because I think I know
why I get killed.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.476
VEGA:
It's not Wynn.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.711
This watch--
it was my dad's.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.346
He was wearing it
when he was murdered

17:26.379 --> 17:28.215
17 years ago, but
it was never recovered.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.416
The ticking sound
from my vision.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.284
Exactly. It must
all be connected.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.619
Yeah, but connected how?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.654
Trying to find the guy
who killed my dad

17:34.687 --> 17:36.189
is gonna get me killed.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
Maybe he's
in this place.

17:37.624 --> 17:38.791
Or was.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.193
We should get Akeela
to run the names

17:40.227 --> 17:41.661
of prisoners and alumni.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.231
Yes, but there might be
something better than names.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.333
Like faces.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.571
Back so soon?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.306
Recordings of
Beta Precrime visions.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.574
You said that
you could poke around.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.808
I need access
to them.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.510
If they did exist,
where would they be?

17:57.544 --> 18:00.147
I told you, the feds mopped up
when Precrime fell.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.149
Maybe FBI,
maybe D.I.A.--

18:02.149 --> 18:03.383
Wait-wait, D.I.A.?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.584
Defense Intelligence.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.619
Blake.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.855
He has a meeting there,
some deputy director.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.858
If they still have recordings
of my father's murder,

18:11.891 --> 18:13.260
I could catch his killer.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.162
Wait, no. You said yourself

18:15.162 --> 18:16.463
that looking
for your father's killer

18:16.496 --> 18:17.764
might be what gets you killed.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.166
Yeah, and if it helps me
catch the guy,

18:19.199 --> 18:20.367
then it's worth the risk.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.202
What if it's
not just you?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.803
At risk?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.572
WALLY:
He's right.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.340
The public never heard
of Beta Precrime.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.541
If you go
asking questions,

18:28.575 --> 18:29.776
someone's gonna wonder
how you know.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.315
Do you trust me?

18:39.386 --> 18:40.620
Then trust me.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.757
BLOMFELD: What happened
to letting Lieutenant Blake

18:44.791 --> 18:46.426
handle the politics, Detective?

18:46.459 --> 18:49.229
I'm learning to multitask,
Mr. Director.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.398
Besides, this place
fascinates me.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.865
So much history.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.202
If only you could
talk about it.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.869
Well, you should come
work for us one day.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.605
Then you could be part of
creating your own history

18:58.638 --> 18:59.939
that you can't
talk about.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.441
Watch it.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.778
Please, sit down.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.647
Much as I would like
this to be a social call,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.649
my reason for asking you
here is a serious one.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.385
I can't give you
too many details,

19:12.419 --> 19:14.521
but there's intelligence
that suggests

19:14.554 --> 19:16.223
a terrorist attack is imminent.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.860
Foreign? Domestic?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.329
What we know for certain is
the group is decentralized.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.863
We think it could be
the same people

19:23.896 --> 19:25.265
who bombed the N.I.H.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.599
Took down the Monument.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.568
But no group was ever pinned
for that attack.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.902
Not officially.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.471
But two words

19:31.504 --> 19:34.341
keep popping up:
"memento mori."

19:34.374 --> 19:35.575
Latin.
Yeah.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.244
For "remember you will die."

19:37.277 --> 19:38.811
Oh, they sound friendly.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.647
You think Hawk-Eye
can help?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.715
Well, it seems to be
the best we have these days.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.251
Computers are the most
accurate predictors

19:44.284 --> 19:45.452
of future threats
that we have left.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.653
Since Precrime.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.754
You said it.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.955
But of course, we wasted that.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.590
On what? Stopping murders?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.325
No, by missing
the bigger picture.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.794
For six years,
the three Precognitives

19:54.827 --> 19:57.464
saw every murder in D.C.
before it happened.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.766
When it turned out the system
wasn't foolproof, we gave up.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.935
The next year, 4,000 people died
in the bombing on the Mall.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.537
And they would've
seen it.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.738
If we'd been smart
enough to keep them.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.374
Instead, we set them free.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.641
And no one knows
where they are now?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.877
(door opens)
AGENT:
Sir...

20:10.910 --> 20:12.645
(whispering)

20:12.679 --> 20:13.980
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to cut this short.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.515
Something's come up.
Of course.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.984
You said six years?

20:18.017 --> 20:20.019
That's how long
the Precrime program ran.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.488
Officially.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.022
I heard rumors
there was beta testing

20:23.055 --> 20:24.724
at least a year
before the public knew.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.262
They were seeing murders
that no one ever tried to stop.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.564
Uh, Vega, the man is busy.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.701
Walk out with me.

20:38.638 --> 20:42.275
The existence of Beta Precrime
was top secret, Detective.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.277
If the public found out
that the federal government

20:44.311 --> 20:45.812
had been predicting murders
that they never stopped...

20:45.845 --> 20:47.447
There'd be
a scandal.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.648
Understandably.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.383
Which no one wants.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.584
And what is it you want?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.019
Justice.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.622
While the D.I.A. was testing
Precrime's accuracy,

20:55.655 --> 20:58.458
no one was ever prosecuted for
the murders the Precogs saw.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.660
If those visions are
still archived somewhere,

21:00.693 --> 21:02.329
Metro can change that.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.831
Cold cases.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.503
My father was murdered
that year.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.704
Vega...

21:11.738 --> 21:13.573
Oh, it's okay, Lieutenant.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.345
We all got into this business
for a reason.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.615
I wish I could help, Detective.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.084
But the Precrime vision archives
were destroyed

21:25.117 --> 21:27.654
when the Supreme Court ruled
the program unconstitutional.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.758
These days, the murder visions
only exist in one place.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.661
Where?

21:34.694 --> 21:36.796
Inside the Precogs' heads.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.733
But good luck finding one.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.478
DASH:
The vision is still in my head?

21:51.511 --> 21:52.679
VEGA:
And according
to Blomfeld,

21:52.712 --> 21:53.980
all other records
have been destroyed.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.382
I'm sorry,
but it's been too long.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.616
If I still had that memory,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.050
I would remember it.
Right, Wally?

21:58.084 --> 21:59.486
Not necessarily.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.787
What?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.054
WALLY:
Over time,

22:02.088 --> 22:03.590
connections break down

22:03.623 --> 22:05.458
in the inferior temporal cortex

22:05.492 --> 22:08.461
and we lose the ability
to access our memories.

22:08.495 --> 22:09.896
We forget.
Correct.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.499
However, some trace of
the memory still exists

22:12.532 --> 22:13.833
as a pattern
of neural connections

22:13.866 --> 22:15.835
deep in the hippocampus.

22:15.868 --> 22:19.539
Exposed to the right stimulus,
those neurons light up.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.841
The right stimulus?
Through BIMR.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.843
Brain Imaging Memory Recall.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.845
"Beemer" for short.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.848
It takes a specialized
piece of equipment

22:28.881 --> 22:30.417
to scan those memories.

22:30.417 --> 22:33.420
And could we find one
of those machines around?

22:34.587 --> 22:35.788
Yes.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.858
Where?

22:41.494 --> 22:42.829
Under the stairs.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.453
I offered to take it
off the program's hands

23:06.486 --> 23:08.455
early in the trial process,

23:08.488 --> 23:10.457
so they never had
a chance to destroy it.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.459
Wally, if you knew you
could access my old visions,

23:12.492 --> 23:13.960
why didn't you tell us?

23:13.993 --> 23:16.195
You didn't tell me
Vega's father was the victim.

23:16.228 --> 23:20.500
Besides, there's some,
uh... discomfort involved.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.834
Well, it can't be worse

23:21.868 --> 23:23.570
than what Dash has
been through already.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.505
There are ways.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.641
Forget it then.
No.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.510
Let's just do it.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.812
But that's not the hard part.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.847
Your visions from
the days of Precrime

23:34.881 --> 23:36.716
were formed as part
of a symbiotic neural link

23:36.749 --> 23:37.984
with your twin brother.

23:38.017 --> 23:40.620
Each brain was just
one half of the whole.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.989
That means we can't even access
those memories without...

23:43.022 --> 23:44.891
Arthur.
Yes.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.893
WALLY:
And visual stimulation--

23:46.926 --> 23:50.663
pictures, home video from you,
Vega, of your father.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.731
I can get those easy.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.065
But I can't get Arthur.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.100
He won't help us.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.201
Sure, he will.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.503
As long as the price is right.

23:56.503 --> 23:57.670
No, not this time.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.672
Why?

23:59.706 --> 24:02.008
What's different?

24:05.712 --> 24:07.046
* You've got those
loud bitches *

24:07.079 --> 24:08.781
* Loud bitches
telling you lies *

24:08.815 --> 24:10.216
* Don't listen to those girls

24:10.249 --> 24:13.085
* They're just snakes
in disguise *

24:13.119 --> 24:15.722
* You've got the truth
coming to you *

24:15.755 --> 24:17.857
* And you've got to see

24:17.890 --> 24:21.193
* Got to step up your game
if you want to run with me *

24:21.227 --> 24:22.762
* Prophecy, prophecy

24:22.795 --> 24:25.097
* Should have been dead by 18

24:25.131 --> 24:27.199
* Oh, mercy me,
I landed back on my feet... *

24:27.233 --> 24:29.235
Careful.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.970
He cheats.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.780
(men chuckle)

24:44.751 --> 24:47.053
I'm certain the guy on your
left is wanted by Interpol.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.588
Please don't arrest him.

24:48.621 --> 24:49.656
Why? He has
all the chips.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.723
Not for long.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.559
What's this about?

24:54.060 --> 24:57.129
Agatha's wrong, Arthur.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.131
My brother would make
a lousy spy.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.767
He knows me.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.669
He knows I couldn't
betray him like that.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.136
Then that settles it.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.305
I'll stake my life and freedom
based on my brother's gut.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.307
I'm gonna need you to.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.177
Because I can't find the person
who killed my father

25:11.210 --> 25:12.779
without your help.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.247
Your father?

25:15.281 --> 25:17.249
It happened
before Precrime started,

25:17.283 --> 25:19.118
when you three were
still in training.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.289
Sorry to hear that.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.826
You guys never knew
your father.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.160
(chuckles)

25:28.194 --> 25:29.696
Terrific role model.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.330
Dumped my mom
before we were born.

25:31.363 --> 25:34.033
Well, mine was a good cop
and even better father.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.603
He was home every night even
though he worked double shifts.

25:36.603 --> 25:41.240
The day he died,
I hurt him.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.975
I know I did.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.977
Families fight.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.312
I've heard.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.014
And what makes you
so warm and fuzzy anyway?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.348
Are you really asking me that?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.083
Ten years in a milk
bath, I know.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.152
But it's not like your
brother had it any easier.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.687
I've seen things he hasn't.

25:54.721 --> 25:58.691
I would never do
anything to hurt Dash.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.092
Or any of you.

26:00.126 --> 26:03.029
I think you know that.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.833
What does your gut say?

26:06.866 --> 26:09.969
That you have a good chance
of ending up dead very soon.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.110
Cash me out.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.348
Only because it's
your damn birthday.

26:32.659 --> 26:36.295
Arthur, you
remember Wally.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.297
Arthur.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.833
So good to see you.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.235
You're the guy who
used to do my nails.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.271
Knock it off.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.675
Let's just do this.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.011
It's, uh, an
optogenic-based

26:52.044 --> 26:53.880
brain-imaging memory
recall device.

26:53.913 --> 26:54.947
It looks for
ion channel...

26:54.981 --> 26:56.816
Try it again.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.284
Like I'm six.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.154
Strap you both
into that thing

27:02.188 --> 27:03.690
and mine your brain
for the vision.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.424
Mine, like dig?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.860
Sure, why not?

27:18.470 --> 27:20.072
Coming?

27:29.015 --> 27:30.316
Thank you.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.251
Anytime.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.454
Never again.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.390
WALLY: You two always
worked more smoothly

27:38.424 --> 27:40.927
with a little lubricant--
dopamine, opioids.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.262
Vodka's the best I got.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.297
What, no tonic?

27:54.006 --> 27:57.176
WALLY:
You'll also need these...

27:57.209 --> 28:00.079
if you've grown attached
to your teeth.

28:27.073 --> 28:29.175
Here comes the pinch.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.783
What we're looking for
are patterns--

28:36.816 --> 28:39.351
specific neural circuits
in their brains

28:39.385 --> 28:41.220
that code for
memories of your dad.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.822
That's why we show
them pictures,

28:42.855 --> 28:44.824
home movies,
recordings of his voice.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.994
MAN:
I, Hamilton Vega

28:48.027 --> 28:51.497
take thee, Lily Vega to be
my lawfully wedded wife.

28:52.865 --> 28:56.102
ALL:
Three, two, one, blow!

28:56.135 --> 28:57.970
(clapping, cheering)

28:58.004 --> 28:59.839
Come on, put
the camera down.

28:59.872 --> 29:00.873
Come on, let's
cut the cake.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.875
They're not responding yet.

29:08.014 --> 29:08.981
How much longer
can they take this?

29:09.015 --> 29:10.149
I don't know.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.317
Their memories
are-are so degraded,

29:11.350 --> 29:13.485
they're not remembering
your dad.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.457
(Hamilton whistles)

29:22.494 --> 29:24.496
He used to whistle this to me.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.500
Hang on, I'm getting something.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.104
WALLY:
It's the whistling.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.973
It's-it's sparking something,
an old vision.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.065
Are you sure you want
to see this?

30:00.532 --> 30:02.068
Yes.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.458
(gun fires)

30:30.229 --> 30:31.530
(gun fires)

30:58.690 --> 31:00.960
Oh, my God.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.405
From everything I found,
Dina Winter is a saint.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.107
ALU Person of the Year,
Luxor genius grant.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.442
You sure she's your guy?

31:16.475 --> 31:18.444
She killed my father
in cold blood.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.512
I saw her do it, we both did.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.449
AKEELA: Well, they didn't have
a history that I can see.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.451
She was into drugs,
though.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.319
Her earlier years.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.655
I count three
possession charges

31:29.688 --> 31:31.257
the same year
your father died.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.358
What about this guy?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.392
Any facial matches?

31:33.425 --> 31:34.961
What do we know about him?

31:34.994 --> 31:37.563
Just that he'd make
a terrible eyewitness.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.398
Can you swipe that off, please?

31:39.431 --> 31:41.400
Sorry.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.502
She just doesn't seem
like the same person.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.337
People will surprise you.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.378
So how do we bring her down?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.380
I confront her.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.315
Record the whole thing
with my lenses,

31:56.348 --> 31:58.617
get her to confess.
And if that doesn't work?

31:58.650 --> 32:00.619
You saw a vision of her
shooting me too, right?

32:00.652 --> 32:02.488
If I can't nail her
for my father's murder,

32:02.521 --> 32:04.991
I'll get her for
attempting mine.
No. No way.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.392
It's too dangerous.
I won't let you.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.726
It's the only way.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.595
She saw me take
my father's watch.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.230
She could run,
she could get away.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.498
You could die.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.203
I think you should do it.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.671
She needs to do it.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.575
VEGA:
I love that you care,

32:23.609 --> 32:27.113
and I'm thankful for what you
and your brother did for me,

32:27.146 --> 32:30.149
but this is something I've been
living with for a long time.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.486
I need to do this, Dash.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.291
Then I need to come with you.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.136
(door opens)

32:50.169 --> 32:52.171
LILY:
Lara?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.608
Hi. Hey.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.177
RICO: Where
are you going?

32:58.210 --> 33:00.179
I was just headed out.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.681
Rico, go.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.319
Uh, Mom, I really have
somewhere to go.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.056
I'm not just leaving to leave.

33:10.056 --> 33:13.292
I still miss him, too, baby.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.533
You ever think about
the person who did it?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.704
For years...

33:25.737 --> 33:29.508
I used to fanaticize about
everything I would do to them.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.478
How much I would give
to spread the hurt.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.413
To make them feel it, too.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.648
But you got over it?

33:36.682 --> 33:39.085
Let's just say that I'm happy

33:39.118 --> 33:41.753
I never found them.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.457
I got to go.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.226
They're chocolate.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.495
Dulce de leche

33:49.528 --> 33:51.697
frosting--
your favorite.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.367
Save me one.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.110
(crickets trilling)

34:04.143 --> 34:06.178
(sighs)

34:06.212 --> 34:08.114
You don't have to do this.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.419
If you think that,
you don't understand.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.590
I was embarrassed

34:18.624 --> 34:20.126
when my father wore his uniform

34:20.159 --> 34:21.727
and dropped me off
at school that day.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.365
I told him to drop me
around the block.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.534
And I'd just walk.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.870
That's not a good enough reason
to get yourself killed.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.439
Don't worry.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.308
I ditched the jersey.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.145
We can change the future, right?

34:39.178 --> 34:43.149
Sometimes it's the past
that's harder to escape.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.521
Vega?

34:49.555 --> 34:51.823
Don't lose yourself in there.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.690
(footsteps approaching)

35:27.293 --> 35:29.561
Detective Vega.

35:29.595 --> 35:32.798
Kind of late
to be making house calls.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.740
I'm pretty sure

35:41.773 --> 35:44.410
you recognize this.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.546
Um, I'm not sure what you mean.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.616
Isn't that the watch you took
from my clinic this morning?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.484
No, it's the watch
you took off my father's body

35:52.518 --> 35:53.752
after you killed him.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.956
You're recording this, I assume?

35:57.989 --> 36:00.759
With one of those
nifty A.R. devices?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.561
I work with criminals, remember?

36:02.594 --> 36:04.330
You are a criminal.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.265
You're a murderer.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.637
The-the person who...

36:11.670 --> 36:14.540
murdered your
father was a junkie.

36:14.573 --> 36:17.243
Someone who

36:17.276 --> 36:19.811
couldn't see past her next fix.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.747
Stop pretending like you're
talking about someone else.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.282
And one stupid night,

36:23.315 --> 36:24.916
when she was
so hopped up on heroin

36:24.950 --> 36:26.252
she couldn't see straight,

36:26.252 --> 36:28.654
she... did something terrible.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.922
Something she could
never take back--

36:30.956 --> 36:32.491
You're talking about yourself!

36:32.524 --> 36:34.526
Calm down, Vega.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.827
Be careful.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.829
That junkie...

36:37.863 --> 36:39.531
It was you, admit it!

36:39.565 --> 36:41.433
(screams)
Vega!

36:41.467 --> 36:43.369
It was you.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.771
That night weighs on her...

36:45.804 --> 36:47.673
still.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.343
And...

36:51.377 --> 36:54.613
no amount of good she's done
has ever made it right.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.947
But...

36:55.981 --> 36:58.684
she kept trying.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.887
Keeps trying.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.624
You got to turn
your life around.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.759
Because you got to have one.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.395
You got to live.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.765
He didn't.

37:13.799 --> 37:14.766
(gasps)

37:14.800 --> 37:16.402
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

37:16.435 --> 37:17.503
Say it was you.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.704
Please...

37:18.737 --> 37:20.439
I-I have a family.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.608
A son-- I've changed.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.310
I'm not that junkie
in the alley anymore.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.611
You expect me to buy that?!

37:25.644 --> 37:26.912
You would shoot me
right now

37:26.945 --> 37:28.380
if you had the chance.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.817
Where's your gun?

37:31.850 --> 37:33.752
I have one for protection,
but, uh--

37:33.785 --> 37:34.886
Not another step!

37:34.920 --> 37:36.988
Where's your gun?!

37:37.022 --> 37:39.491
The only person
with a gun here is you!

37:46.965 --> 37:50.369
You can't know

37:50.402 --> 37:51.870
how sorry I am.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.874
It was the worst mistake
I'll ever make.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.911
Saying yes.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.984
"Saying... yes"?

38:06.017 --> 38:08.520
To the job.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.991
You were hired?

38:13.024 --> 38:15.060
Vega, look in the mirror!

38:25.771 --> 38:27.005
Uh, are you okay, Mom?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.374
Bradford,
put down my gun!

38:28.374 --> 38:29.741
Bradford-- that's your name?

38:30.742 --> 38:32.478
I'm Detective Vega.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.380
Don't move!

38:34.380 --> 38:36.047
DASH:
Vega, look at his shirt.

38:37.949 --> 38:40.419
Maybe you weren't
the victim in my vision.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.453
He was!

38:45.891 --> 38:47.393
Bradford.

38:47.426 --> 38:49.561
How about this?

38:49.595 --> 38:53.031
How about I put
my gun down first?

38:53.064 --> 38:55.667
Okay?

39:02.874 --> 39:04.776
Okay...
Stay back!

39:07.713 --> 39:10.048
Bradford,
a long time ago,

39:10.081 --> 39:13.118
your mom...

39:13.151 --> 39:15.587
did something she
can't take back.

39:17.723 --> 39:20.792
I won't make the same mistake.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.795
You shouldn't, either.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.098
This isn't the way.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.767
Listen to her, honey.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.649
Okay.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.916
You're okay.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.585
You're okay.
Are you okay?!

39:46.618 --> 39:49.154
Yeah.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.022
Please,
he-he didn't mean to--

39:51.056 --> 39:54.660
(whispers):
Go upstairs, baby.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.731
Before...

39:59.765 --> 40:03.101
you said someone
hired you to kill my dad.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.670
Who?

40:07.939 --> 40:09.975
Lycon.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.744
He was my dealer.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.080
Some guys came to him.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.449
Said to make it look
like a mugging.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.850
Which guys?
Who were they?

40:18.884 --> 40:19.918
I don't know.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.920
I never met them face to face.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.222
But I will tell you

40:24.255 --> 40:25.757
everything I know.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.092
Just...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.628
keep my son out of this.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.497
Please?

40:31.530 --> 40:33.465
Let this end with us.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.040
An eyeless man?

40:42.073 --> 40:44.209
Lycon, a longtime dope peddler
in the Sprawl

40:44.242 --> 40:46.211
back when Deena was a junkie.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.813
He might be the go-between

40:47.846 --> 40:49.581
for whoever hired her
to kill my father.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.182
DASH:
No one's heard
from him in years,

40:51.216 --> 40:53.752
but we figured
with your connections...

40:53.785 --> 40:55.086
If this is all

40:55.120 --> 40:57.923
you have to go on,
it's pretty thin.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.793
I'll look into it on my end.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.995
Thank you, Arthur.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.264
For this and for before.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.700
I don't expect a
thank you from you.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.570
But an apology for slugging me
in the mouth would be nice.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.271
Why?
You deserved it.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.906
Okay, then.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.274
But next time?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.176
I hit you back.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.712
You know
your way out.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.050
I just need a little more time.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.185
You know I'll help you
with this Lycon thing.

41:27.218 --> 41:29.254
Whatever you need.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.122
Thanks.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.659
But right now,
I need to go home.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.563
Vega?

41:39.197 --> 41:40.799
When you get home,

41:40.832 --> 41:42.734
grab the chair.

41:47.573 --> 41:51.577
* Ooh...

41:51.577 --> 41:55.947
* Baby, baby, babe

41:55.981 --> 41:59.117
* I'm coming home

41:59.150 --> 42:02.588
* To your tender sweet loving

42:02.588 --> 42:06.725
* You're my one and only woman

42:06.758 --> 42:10.629
* The world leaves a bitter
taste in my mouth, girl... *

42:10.662 --> 42:12.263
Mom?

42:12.297 --> 42:15.066
* You're the only one
that I want *

42:15.100 --> 42:18.003
* Wanna be around

42:18.036 --> 42:21.940
* Ooh...

42:21.973 --> 42:25.744
Happy birthday.

42:25.777 --> 42:29.114
* Wanna be around girl, ooh...

42:29.147 --> 42:34.085
* Wanna be around, girl

42:34.119 --> 42:39.190
* Ooh, wanna be around

42:43.862 --> 42:48.033
* Baby, how I'd be grieving

42:48.066 --> 42:50.168
(sobbing)

42:50.201 --> 42:54.339
* All alone, by myself

42:54.372 --> 42:57.976
* I don't want nobody else

42:58.009 --> 43:01.046
* The world leaves
a bitter taste... *

43:01.079 --> 43:03.381
(crying)

43:03.414 --> 43:07.085
* You're the only one
that I want *

43:07.118 --> 43:10.656
* Wanna be around

43:10.689 --> 43:13.759
* Ooh...

43:13.792 --> 43:16.795
It's over.

43:16.828 --> 43:20.198
* Ooh, wanna be around,
girl... *
