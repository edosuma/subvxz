WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:08.173
- ¶

00:08.175 --> 00:10.709
- All right, Max.
Think we can lift 500 pounds?

00:10.711 --> 00:14.013
- Let's give it a shot.
- Okay.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.283
- BOTH:
Ooh! Ooh! Huh!

00:20.588 --> 00:24.757
[straining]

00:26.727 --> 00:28.761
- This...this is nothin'.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.796
- Oh, totally easy.

00:30.798 --> 00:34.233
- Think we can stop now?
- Yes, please!

00:34.735 --> 00:35.300
Ah! See?

00:35.302 --> 00:38.203
Told you we could sneak in
a little pre-dinner workout.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.171
Feeling the burn?

00:39.173 --> 00:42.274
- My eyes burn from
your workout stink.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.376
- That would be you.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.446
- [sniffs]
Oh! You're right.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.781
- We're crushing it, Max.

00:48.783 --> 00:52.151
I really think this whole
Z Force thing is gonna work out.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.685
[laughs]
Get it?

00:53.687 --> 00:55.154
'Cause we're workin' out?

00:55.156 --> 00:56.722
- I'm gonna hit
you with a dumbbell.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.525
Get it? 'Cause I'm gonna
hit you with a dumbbell?

00:59.527 --> 01:01.226
- All right.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.396
- Speaking of dumbbells.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.098
- What are you
doing here, Max?

01:06.100 --> 01:08.233
I thought you
and the band had a show.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.568
- Not till 6:00.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.769
- I'm no time-a-matician,

01:10.771 --> 01:13.338
but I'm pretty sure
it's 6:00 right now.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.374
- I don't think so, Cherry.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.677
It's 6:30.
[laughs]

01:18.679 --> 01:19.778
6:30?!

01:19.780 --> 01:21.647
Phoebe, how could you
let this happen?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.781
- I'm not your assistant!

01:22.783 --> 01:25.651
- Not with that
attitude, you're not!

01:25.653 --> 01:27.786
I have to change.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.254
- And shower!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.757
Smell like an onion!

01:32.326 --> 01:36.128
- HANK & CHLOE:
No. Next. Pass.

01:36.130 --> 01:40.132
- Kids, entertain us before
my thumb falls off.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.667
- Billy, this is
our chance.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.801
Let's do the Billy and Nora

01:42.803 --> 01:44.803
comedy show we've
been practicing.

01:44.805 --> 01:45.504
- Right now?

01:45.506 --> 01:46.805
If I'd known,
I would've worn underwear.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.708
- No, you wouldn't have.
- It's true.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.711
- Let the show begin.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.881
- Hey, Nora.
Let's go downstairs.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.219
- Why are you
taking the stairs?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.688
The elevator's way faster.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.790
Bing!

02:04.959 --> 02:08.527
- [giggles]
That's comedy gold.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.429
- HANK & BARB:
[laughing]

02:10.431 --> 02:11.864
- I found my bow.

02:11.866 --> 02:14.333
But where is my arrow?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.567
- Found it!

02:15.569 --> 02:17.202
- BARB:
[laughing]

02:17.204 --> 02:18.437
The kids are really funny.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.406
- I know.
They got it from me.

02:21.408 --> 02:25.310
Knock-knock!
- This is our show, old man.

02:27.715 --> 02:28.313
- Hey, Nora.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.150
Did you hear about the crab who
only thought about himself?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.184
- Sure did.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.219
He was real...shellfish.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.287
- Hey-yo!

02:35.289 --> 02:36.722
- BARB & HANK:
[laughing]

02:36.724 --> 02:38.757
- MRS. WONG: [on TV]
Hello, Hiddenville.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.159
Do you like to laugh?

02:40.161 --> 02:41.860
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.

02:41.862 --> 02:46.465
But if you do, then come on down
to Splatterday Night Live.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.599
- Why would we do that

02:47.601 --> 02:49.568
when we have comedy right
here in our own home?

02:49.570 --> 02:52.871
- Every performer gets free
burgers for their table.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.575
- Kids, you're performing!
Barb, bust out my burger bib!

02:56.577 --> 02:58.744
- Perform in a crowded
restaurant?

02:58.746 --> 02:59.745
We can't do that.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.414
- Too late.
The bib is on.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.650
- We're not gonna
push the kids,

03:04.652 --> 03:06.218
especially if they've
got stage fright.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.587
- We don't have stage fright.
Right, Billy?

03:08.589 --> 03:09.755
- Of course, we don't.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.890
I'm definitely not afraid
of looking ridiculous

03:11.892 --> 03:14.793
like Dad in his
weird neck diaper.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.297
- There is nothing weird
about a grown man

03:18.299 --> 03:20.666
protecting his clothes.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.401
- We're gonna do great.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.402
We just need to
go practice.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.804
- But if we get up there
and everyone laughs at us?

03:25.806 --> 03:28.240
- That's what we want.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.310
- We also want burgers.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.478
Let's not forget
about that.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.514
They'd better not
ruin this for us.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.517
- The bib is on, baby!

03:38.519 --> 03:39.651
- [palm slap]

03:39.653 --> 03:42.487
- Guys, guys, guys!
I'm sorry I'm late.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.656
- Late? You missed
the whole show.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.227
This is totally not
sweetious, broseph.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.230
Wolfgang had to sing
in your place.

03:51.232 --> 03:56.301
- [high-pitched]
¶ Wolfgang ¶

03:56.303 --> 03:58.503
Wolfgang!

03:58.505 --> 04:00.572
- Eesh.
It looks serious.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.007
- Yeah, and private.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.710
Let's go listen in.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.946
- Look, guys,
I can explain.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.948
It was...
all Phoebe's fault.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.285
Yeah, she hogged
the bathroom for hours,

04:13.287 --> 04:14.987
pluckin' her face,
or curlin' her forehead,

04:14.989 --> 04:16.788
or whatever girls
do in there.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.758
- I thought your forehead
looked extra curly.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.792
Can you do mine?

04:20.794 --> 04:22.961
- No, Cherry.
That didn't happen.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.630
I talked Max into a Z Force
training session,

04:24.632 --> 04:26.298
but he can't tell
the band that.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.901
- Phoebe's flawless beauty
has nothing to do with this.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.536
You've missed
a bunch of shows.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.572
My grandpa has been to
more gigs than you.

04:33.574 --> 04:37.409
- You ruined everything,
Max Thunderman!

04:40.581 --> 04:41.446
- Yeah, like yesterday.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.582
We were supposed
to work on band names.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.549
But you were at the hospital

04:44.551 --> 04:47.452
because Phoebe got her head
stuck in a mayonnaise jar.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.354
- You, too?

04:50.591 --> 04:51.723
- Look, you're right, guys.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.725
I'm really, really sorry.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.995
- I'm just too upset to
talk about it right now.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.732
- If you're gonna cry,
then I'm gonna cry.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.867
[crying]

05:01.869 --> 05:04.870
- [sobbing]
Wolfgang crying, ja.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.340
- His friends
seem really upset.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.776
- Not as upset
as Grandpa Giddy.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.012
- You're the worst,
Max Thunderman!

05:14.481 --> 05:16.481
- Oh, maybe I've been
pushing Max too hard

05:16.483 --> 05:17.349
with all this training.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.751
I mean, what if they kick him
out of the band because of me?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.353
He won't wanna be
my Z Force partner.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.555
- They'd never kick
Max out of the band.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.489
- So it's decided.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.758
We're kicking Max
out of the band.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.027
Oh, is this mic still on?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.996
- Nope, didn't
hear a thing.

05:30.998 --> 05:31.630
- Hey, Gideon.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.699
Remember when we took
Phoebe to the heart tree?

05:33.701 --> 05:36.101
- Okay, turn it off.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.504
- ¶

05:39.506 --> 05:40.572
¶ What you see ¶

05:40.574 --> 05:41.773
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:41.775 --> 05:45.410
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:45.412 --> 05:46.912
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:46.914 --> 05:48.380
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:48.382 --> 05:49.881
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:49.883 --> 05:51.616
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

05:51.618 --> 05:53.518
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

05:53.520 --> 05:55.387
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

05:55.389 --> 05:56.722
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

05:56.724 --> 05:58.390
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

05:58.392 --> 06:00.359
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

06:00.361 --> 06:01.793
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:01.795 --> 06:02.861
¶ Just your average family ¶

06:02.863 --> 06:06.498
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

06:06.500 --> 06:10.769
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

06:13.640 --> 06:16.074
- You know, Phoebe, if things
go bad with you and Max,

06:16.076 --> 06:19.678
I can always be your
new Z Force partner.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.813
[grunting loudly]

06:21.815 --> 06:25.917
Ooh, yeah. You'd better
fix this thing with Max.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.018
- Don't worry, Cherry.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.820
Max isn't getting kicked
out of the band,

06:28.822 --> 06:30.522
because I came up
with a plan.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.858
- [gasps] Oh, I love
a good Phoebe plan.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.693
I also love a bad
Phoebe plan.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.562
I just love all
the Phoebe plans.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.032
- Here comes our
little rocker now.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.234
- Okay, Phoebe.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.769
What's the big emergency?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.003
- You're the big emergency.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.705
But luckily,
Dr. Phoebe's

06:46.707 --> 06:50.108
got 20 cc's of help
comin' your way.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.978
- Hey, why is my band here?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.880
- Hey, Max. Listen, man.
We need to talk.

06:54.882 --> 06:58.116
- What a great talk.
Now that that's over, um...

06:58.118 --> 07:01.953
Max has something he really
wants to show you guys.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.888
- I do?

07:02.890 --> 07:03.955
- Yeah. Remember?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.824
You felt terrible about
bailing on the band,

07:05.826 --> 07:10.629
and you wanted to
surprise them with...

07:10.631 --> 07:12.297
this!

07:12.299 --> 07:15.867
A new rehearsal space!

07:15.869 --> 07:17.602
- Oh, sweetious!

07:17.604 --> 07:19.137
- There are no words.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.138
- Wolfgang!

07:20.140 --> 07:23.308
- You found a word.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.142
- Wow.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.611
This is so nice of me.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.612
- It sure is.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.148
You must really
love your band.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.016
- Thanks, Max.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.918
You know, we were really
starting to think

07:32.920 --> 07:35.120
this was the fall
of the broman empire.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.755
- Yeah. I promised
my grandpa

07:36.757 --> 07:38.857
we were gonna kick
you outta the band,

07:38.859 --> 07:41.159
but this changes everything.

07:41.328 --> 07:45.630
- I still don't like you,
Max Thunderman!

07:49.336 --> 07:50.068
- All right, Billy.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.638
Let's see if we have all of our
props for tonight's show--

07:53.640 --> 07:55.707
string cheese...

07:57.911 --> 07:59.945
horseshoe.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.013
- Let's go, you two.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.281
The sooner I hear
your bad jokes,

08:03.283 --> 08:06.685
the sooner I can hit you
with my tomato cannon.

08:08.789 --> 08:09.354
- Whatever.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.624
We're gonna be great because
we have a rubber chicken.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.893
Where's our rubber chicken?

08:14.895 --> 08:15.660
- It must be lost.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.329
Guess we'll have to
cancel the show.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.930
- Or we could use
a real chicken.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.033
Dad always has one in
his secret meat fridge.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.037
- I see two chickens
right here--

08:26.039 --> 08:30.208
you and the one you're
hiding behind your back.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.843
- You caught me, Colosso.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.811
Just don't tell Nora.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.213
- Billy, let's have
a chat over here...

08:35.215 --> 08:37.883
in front of
my tomato cannon.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.886
- I don't see how
that could go wrong.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.089
- You clearly don't wanna
go on stage at Splatburger.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.357
- No, I do wanna
go on stage.

08:45.359 --> 08:49.794
But just thinking about it makes
me wanna superspeed vomit.

08:49.796 --> 08:53.231
You do not wanna see that.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.700
- Is it weird that I do?

08:56.703 --> 08:57.335
Eh, never mind.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.804
Tell me more about
your stage fright.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.039
- I don't wanna
let Nora down,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.008
but performing in front
of all those people

09:03.010 --> 09:04.976
staring at me
sounds terrifying.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.813
- I feel the same way every time
I have to go to the bathroom

09:08.815 --> 09:10.415
in front of you people.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.852
- But you go to the bathroom
in front of us all the time.

09:13.854 --> 09:17.389
- Not as much
as I'd like to.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.724
- What should I do?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.192
- Well, you've got
two choices.

09:21.194 --> 09:25.397
"A," you tell Nora that
you're a big-old scaredy baby.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.232
- No. I can't do that.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.100
I'm her hero.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.268
- Okay.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.737
That's definitely
not true.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.139
So, we'll go with "B,"

09:34.141 --> 09:38.843
sabotage the act so you don't
have to go up there on stage.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.411
- How?

09:39.413 --> 09:42.147
- I'll tell ya!
But first...

09:42.149 --> 09:44.349
- [tomato splats]

09:45.152 --> 09:47.152
- Now you're
afraid of tomatoes.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.186
- Why are you--

09:48.188 --> 09:49.421
- [tomato splats]
- [gasps]

09:49.423 --> 09:52.424
- [evil laughter]
- [tomatoes splatting]

09:52.426 --> 09:54.292
- Dance, funny boy!
Dance!

09:54.294 --> 09:56.761
- [gasps]
- [tomatoes splatting]

09:56.763 --> 10:00.432
- [band playing rock music]

10:00.434 --> 10:01.399
- You hear that?

10:01.401 --> 10:02.434
That's a Phoebe plan
comin' together.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.070
- Ooh, I love it when
a Phoebe plan comes together!

10:05.072 --> 10:09.441
I also love it when a Phoebe
plan doesn't come together.

10:09.443 --> 10:13.745
I just love all
Phoebe plans.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.013
- Phoebe, we need to talk.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.783
Cherry, you can stay,
but...don't.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.918
- I'm no word-a-matician,

10:19.920 --> 10:23.088
but I think you
want me to leave.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.158
- You, you, you!

10:27.160 --> 10:30.762
- Yes, me, me, me.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.463
- What did you do?

10:31.465 --> 10:33.798
- I kept your friends from
kicking you out of the band.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.334
- But that is exactly what
I wanted them to do.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.470
I've been working
on this for months.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.871
And you ruined everything!

10:39.873 --> 10:41.840
- [sighs] Yeah, right,
what kind of psycho

10:41.842 --> 10:44.909
tries to get themselves kicked
out of their own band?

10:44.911 --> 10:46.511
Oh, you.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.185
- ¶

10:54.187 --> 10:55.320
- Okay, wait,
you were slacking off

10:55.322 --> 10:57.188
so they would kick you
out of the band?

10:57.190 --> 10:59.090
Why would you
do that? Why?

10:59.092 --> 11:02.127
Just tell me one
thing...why?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.763
- Look, being in a band
used to be one of my dreams--

11:04.765 --> 11:08.033
that, and finding a way
to make cats talk.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.501
- Really? Cats?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.069
- They're so sneaky.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.338
What are they thinking?

11:14.074 --> 11:17.442
Anyway, now Z Force
is my dream.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.076
- Wait.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.545
So the band wanting to kick
you out wasn't my fault?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.080
Why'd you blame me?

11:22.082 --> 11:24.549
- That was just more fun.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.484
And I couldn't just
quit the band.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.787
- Why not?
- Well, 'cause...

11:28.789 --> 11:30.488
if I tell them
I wanna quit,

11:30.490 --> 11:32.123
they'll never talk
to me again.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.158
I'll lose my best friends.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.392
- Max, just 'cause
you quit the band

11:34.394 --> 11:36.828
doesn't mean they'll never
talk to you again.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.395
- Oh, yeah?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.898
What happened to Cornelius
when he left One Direction?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.233
- Who?
- Exactly!

11:42.836 --> 11:44.836
But if the band
kicks you out,

11:44.838 --> 11:47.072
they feel bad, and the
friendship lives on.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.239
- Okay, that can't be
how bands work.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.143
- It is, and you would know that
if you were a musical person.

11:52.145 --> 11:56.948
- Um, you know I spent last
summer at pan flute camp.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.518
I was the best
one there.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.288
I was the only one there.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.193
- Do you know how
hard it's gonna be

12:08.195 --> 12:10.395
to get them all mad at me
again with this face?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.964
Look at this face, Phoebe!

12:13.133 --> 12:16.101
- One of your eyebrows
is longer than the other.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.869
- Quiet!
I need to think.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.438
- Oh! I'll play you some
thinking music.

12:20.440 --> 12:25.076
- [plays "Greensleeves" badly]

12:26.880 --> 12:29.380
- Wanna know what
I'm thinkin' now?

12:29.382 --> 12:32.417
- That you wanna
break my pan flute?

12:33.587 --> 12:36.554
- Actually,
you gave me an idea.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.990
The band will
definitely kick me out

12:38.992 --> 12:40.425
if I just book
the worst gig ever.

12:40.427 --> 12:45.563
I just need to find a place as
annoying as your pan flute.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.433
- [carnival music playing]

12:48.435 --> 12:50.902
- Welcome to
the Merry Meerkat.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.104
- This place isn't annoying.
It's adorable.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.573
- MEERKAT:
Come on, kids, follow me!

12:55.575 --> 12:58.977
- KIDS:
[screaming]

12:59.179 --> 13:01.279
- Aw, hi.
Look at this little angel.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.148
- [heavy thud]
- Oh!

13:03.150 --> 13:07.185
[gasps]
Okay. This might work.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.421
- ¶

13:10.423 --> 13:14.058
- Ew. My burger has
a bone in it.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.594
- Mm, a free bone.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.231
- Why do we keep
coming here?

13:21.268 --> 13:25.270
- Live from Hiddenville,
it's Splatterday Night!

13:25.272 --> 13:28.673
It's the who's who
of the who cares?!

13:28.675 --> 13:30.508
I'm your host,
Mrs. Wong.

13:30.510 --> 13:35.280
Uh, before we get started,
anyone here from out of town?

13:35.282 --> 13:38.316
You're not better than us.
Put your hand down.

13:39.553 --> 13:40.485
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

13:40.487 --> 13:43.454
- What are you laughing at,
neck diaper?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.123
- BARB:
[laughing]

13:45.125 --> 13:48.059
It does look like a diaper.
[laughs]

13:48.061 --> 13:50.562
- Okay, our first
performer tonight

13:50.564 --> 13:53.364
is some kind of
comedy ghost.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.333
- I'm a mime.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.503
- Mimes don't talk, dummy.

14:00.974 --> 14:05.109
- What was it Colosso said
I had to do to Nora?

14:05.111 --> 14:07.612
- I told you to
sabotage the act!

14:07.614 --> 14:09.347
- Thanks, Colosso.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.415
Wait, you're in my head?

14:10.417 --> 14:13.017
- Yep, and there's
room to spare.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.253
I've been walking around
here for hours.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.522
Haven't seen
a single thought.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.524
- Have you met
Major Monkey yet?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.659
You'll know him
when you see him.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.694
- COLOSSO:
Focus!

14:22.696 --> 14:24.162
Unless you want to perform,

14:24.164 --> 14:25.997
you'd better go rattle
Nora's confidence

14:25.999 --> 14:28.366
and keep her off that stage.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.434
- Got it.

14:29.436 --> 14:33.538
- Uh...you hear
voices, too, huh?

14:34.407 --> 14:37.575
Because if you don't,
then neither do I.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.078
[chuckling]

14:41.548 --> 14:43.748
- CROWD:
[booing]

14:43.750 --> 14:46.417
- Wow.
Tough crowd, Nora.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.419
Are you sure
we should do this?

14:48.421 --> 14:49.554
- They're supposed to boo.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.589
He's some sort
of comedy ghost.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.691
- I said I'm a mime!

14:55.528 --> 14:56.594
- Our act is way better.

14:56.596 --> 15:02.567
- Up next, ugh, those
Thunderbrats, Billy and Nora.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.301
Let me guess.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.571
Your father forced you to come
so he could eat free food.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.340
- You don't have
to answer that!

15:09.342 --> 15:11.509
- It's show time, Billy!

15:14.314 --> 15:17.715
How are you doin'
tonight, Hiddenville?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.050
Hey, Billy.

15:19.052 --> 15:22.153
What do you call
a lemon in need?

15:22.455 --> 15:23.454
Well, that's our time.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.790
You've been
a lovely audience. Bye!

15:27.193 --> 15:30.094
- Wow! Well, I guess I'd
better kill some time.

15:30.096 --> 15:34.098
So, a family of rats walked
into Splatburger.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.102
That's not a joke.
It really happened.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.139
- [polka music playing]

15:41.141 --> 15:43.741
- All right, I know I should've
minded my own business.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.477
But did I really have to carry
all your band's equipment?

15:46.479 --> 15:48.646
- Not all.
I carried my pick.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.648
- PHOEBE:
Oh.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.217
- Good, the band's here.

15:53.219 --> 15:56.754
They're definitely gonna kick me
out when they see this place.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.756
- OYSTER: Hey, bro.
We got your text.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.224
- Good.
Grab your instruments,

16:00.226 --> 16:04.262
'cause we're the new Meerkat
Fun Time Happy Band!

16:04.264 --> 16:06.331
- You want us to
rock out here?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.765
- Whoa, not cool, Max.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.233
I would kick you out
of my band for this,

16:09.235 --> 16:13.838
but also totally stay
friends with you.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.639
- So?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.307
Are you guys mad?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.775
- Yeah, we're mad...

16:17.777 --> 16:21.245
that you didn't come up
with this idea sooner!

16:21.247 --> 16:23.648
- Now they can't tell us
we're too old to be here.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.149
- GIDEON & WOLFGANG:
[laugh]

16:25.151 --> 16:27.118
- Oh, good.
I knew you'd like it.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.654
- Come on, let's rock
the snot outta these kids.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.556
- Wait, wait!
There's something else.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.359
- [gasps]
Where does it end, Max?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.261
Definitely with friendship.

16:37.263 --> 16:40.264
- And this thing might
be a deal breaker.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.233
[laughs]

16:44.404 --> 16:46.537
- I am never taking
this off!

16:46.539 --> 16:49.640
- I just wanna
snuggle myself.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.209
- So soften.

16:51.211 --> 16:55.346
- That's it. I'm gonna do
the worst thing imaginable.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.547
Hey, guys.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.150
My sister's joining the band.
- What?

16:59.152 --> 17:01.586
- Huh?
- Wolfgang?

17:02.389 --> 17:04.422
- Yeah. It's cool.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.423
In fact, it's...

17:05.425 --> 17:08.893
pantastic!
[plays a few notes]

17:10.296 --> 17:12.430
- Max, we can't have
a sister in the band,

17:12.432 --> 17:15.833
especially one who used
to be in love with me.

17:16.870 --> 17:21.873
- That could create a huge
hole in the brozone layer.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.375
- Sorry, guys,
either we spend our lives

17:24.377 --> 17:27.445
being the world's worst
pan flute rock band...

17:27.447 --> 17:28.846
- [plays one note]

17:28.848 --> 17:31.716
- ...or you guys
kick me out.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.352
- Band huddle.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.454
- This is it!

17:38.591 --> 17:39.791
- Max, you're out...

17:39.793 --> 17:44.562
of your mind if you think
we don't love that idea!

17:45.832 --> 17:49.600
- Band cuddle!
- Woo!

17:49.602 --> 17:52.370
- ¶

17:52.372 --> 17:53.704
- Come on, Billy.
Come out.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.473
- [British accent]
Billy's not here.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.209
I'm Belvedere,
the talking burger.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.411
- [lasers zapping]
- Ow!

18:00.413 --> 18:02.880
- Billy, just tell me
what's going on.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.382
- Fine.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.750
Nora, I know I'm your hero

18:05.752 --> 18:07.585
and you think I have
it all together--

18:07.587 --> 18:10.755
- You're wearing
two different shoes.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.858
- The truth is...

18:13.860 --> 18:15.393
[sighs]

18:15.395 --> 18:16.761
I have stage fright.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.896
- So that's why you've
been acting weird.

18:18.898 --> 18:22.867
Billy, it's perfectly normal
to be a little bit scared.

18:22.869 --> 18:23.568
- It is?

18:23.570 --> 18:27.772
Is it normal that I took a bite
out of that plastic burger?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.341
- One problem at a time.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.809
For now let's fix
your stage fright.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.979
- But what about all those
people staring at me?

18:34.981 --> 18:36.681
- Don't worry.
I think I have a way.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.583
You won't even know
they're there.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.518
- You give it lemonade!

18:40.520 --> 18:41.652
Hey-yo!

18:41.654 --> 18:43.921
- CROWD:
[laughing]

18:43.923 --> 18:44.589
- Hey, Billy.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.792
Did you hear about the jungle
cat who won at poker?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.293
- Sure did.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.528
He was a big cheetah!

18:50.530 --> 18:51.929
- CROWD:
[laughing]

18:51.931 --> 18:54.398
- [laughs]
What a great night.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.367
The kids are hilarious.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.768
- And we got free burgers.

18:57.770 --> 19:02.540
- Uh, the burgers are free,
but the buns are $20 each.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.410
- Please tell me this
is part of the comedy act.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.445
- For me it is!

19:07.447 --> 19:10.848

On vocals, It's Maxaroo!

19:27.967 --> 19:31.435

19:43.449 --> 19:45.283

- CROWD:
[cheering & applause]

20:08.875 --> 20:11.609
- Thank you, meerkitties!

20:11.611 --> 20:13.611
Good night!

20:13.613 --> 20:14.045
Oh?

20:14.047 --> 20:16.581
Uh, and, uh, if you
happen to have lost

20:16.583 --> 20:17.682
a child in the ball pit,

20:17.684 --> 20:20.885
please claim him at
the front desk. Thank you.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.422
They should be beyond
embarrassed after that gig.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.723
- That gig was amazing.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.492
Did you see those moms?

20:28.494 --> 20:31.929
- And those grandmas.
Woo!

20:31.931 --> 20:34.832
- Phoebe, come here.

20:36.336 --> 20:36.834
Now what?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.903
It's like everything I do,
they just love me more.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.071
- Of course they do, Max.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.472
They're your friends.

20:41.474 --> 20:46.577
Nothing you do can
kanga-ruin that.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.044
Sorry.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.646
Seriously,
just go tell them

20:48.648 --> 20:50.414
you don't wanna be
in the band anymore.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.383
- No. You can't make me.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.951
- Uh, yes I can.
Hop to it!

20:53.953 --> 20:58.823
- [powers whooshing]
- Stop...making...me...hop!

21:00.059 --> 21:01.025
Hey, guys.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.027
I have something to say.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.529
And you might want to
sit down to hear this.

21:05.531 --> 21:09.467
- I don't think we can
in these costumes.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.435
- Okay. Um, look...

21:11.437 --> 21:13.504
I'm really sorry to
say this, but...

21:13.506 --> 21:16.540
I don't wanna be
in the band anymore.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.777
- Oh.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.379
Well, I've actually
been thinking about

21:21.381 --> 21:22.913
quitting the band, too.

21:22.915 --> 21:23.581
- You have?

21:23.583 --> 21:25.516
- Yeah, so I can spend
more time with Cherry.

21:25.518 --> 21:29.120
I'm hoping some of her
smarts will rub off on me.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.622
- I was thinking about
quitting, too.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.458
Grandpa Giddy and I are
shooting our own reality show--

21:34.460 --> 21:35.693
"Keeping Up With
the Giddys."

21:35.695 --> 21:38.396
- Coming this fall!

21:38.931 --> 21:41.565
- Okay, so, we're all
good with quitting?

21:41.567 --> 21:44.068
- Please, no quitten!

21:44.070 --> 21:47.538
- It sounds like Wolfgang's
on board, too!

21:47.540 --> 21:48.706
I guess none of
us said anything

21:48.708 --> 21:52.109
because we wanted to make
sure we stayed friends.

21:52.111 --> 21:52.877
Hmph.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.445
That means we always will.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.013
- Always, broseph.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.114
- Heh heh.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.850
- [pan flute music]

21:59.852 --> 22:01.986
- [heavy thud]

22:02.889 --> 22:06.057
- Whose...child is that?

22:10.797 --> 22:26.777
