00:04.506 --> 00:09.302
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.472
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.203
FATHER: Here in your heart...

17:58.996 --> 18:02.249
The place we will make our stand
against this evil.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.419
But, I was not there for you.

18:05.669 --> 18:06.670
Nonsense.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.715
Aku's victories are not your failures.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.843
The struggle against Aku
is arduous,

18:12.926 --> 18:16.555
and none have fought
more bravely than you, my son.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.266
MOTHER: You have won
many victories,

18:19.349 --> 18:23.186
rekindling hope in the hearts
of those you have protected.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.564
Each sends their blessing.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.861
FATHER: Each blessing,

18:30.944 --> 18:33.113
a stone to fortify this land.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.415
Your castle is strong, my son.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.667
MOTHER: Your allies are many.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.506
Wield what lies within

18:53.342 --> 18:55.302
and reclaim what is yours.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.141
Break this siege of darkness.

(SLURPS)

20:33.900 --> 20:35.152
Master Ning,

20:35.986 --> 20:37.404
how can you forgive one

20:37.487 --> 20:39.531
who has raised his sword
against you

20:40.073 --> 20:42.284
and defiled your sanctuary so?

20:42.451 --> 20:45.829
Although, the pool of convergence
is destroyed,

20:45.912 --> 20:47.706
the Nexus still exists.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.209
In time,
we will reconstruct the gateway.

20:51.793 --> 20:52.794
As for you,

20:53.336 --> 20:55.964
had you not defeated
the demon within,

20:56.548 --> 20:59.426
it surely would have
destroyed us all.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.887
We owe you our lives.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.557
My son, all debts are paid.

21:08.727 --> 21:09.936
All, but one.

21:12.647 --> 21:15.108
I said, get off your fat <i>tochis</i>

21:15.233 --> 21:17.611
and get the ladder,
you lazy bum.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.322
Oh, don't yell at me.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.491
I didn't steal the gems, eh?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.201
(GASPS)

21:26.286 --> 21:29.206
I... I think you better
come out here.
