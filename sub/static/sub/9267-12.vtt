00:32.537 --> 00:33.537
We had a deal.

00:33.571 --> 00:36.673
I screw up my life,
you fix yours.

00:37.527 --> 00:39.861
How long are you gonna hold it
over my head, man?

00:39.896 --> 00:42.430
The rest of my life
if I feel it needs to be.

00:42.465 --> 00:43.765
I had another conversation

00:43.800 --> 00:45.934
with that Dana Weldon
from Braemore.

00:45.968 --> 00:48.036
They want me to come
do that interview.

00:48.070 --> 00:49.271
I'm just really confused, okay?

00:49.305 --> 00:50.539
Tim's back, and I just have

00:50.573 --> 00:52.841
a lot of feelings
that I just need to sort out.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.810
There's only gonna be
one football program in Dillon.

00:54.844 --> 00:58.647
Which program are they
planning on cutting, Levi?

00:58.681 --> 01:02.384
He's in. The East Dillon Lions
are going to State.

01:02.418 --> 01:04.486
I want you.

01:04.519 --> 01:07.155
We're offering you
the dean of admissions.

01:16.165 --> 01:18.600
Have a great night.

01:28.911 --> 01:31.580
Hello?

01:33.883 --> 01:35.350
Hey, honey, is that you?

01:36.853 --> 01:40.622
Oh, hey, babe.

01:40.656 --> 01:42.791
Ah, I missed you.

01:42.825 --> 01:44.359
- I missed you too.
- Mm-hmm.

01:44.393 --> 01:46.661
I'm so excited to tell you
about my trip.

01:46.696 --> 01:49.431
Oh, I can't wait to hear
about your trip.

01:49.465 --> 01:51.533
Hey, I've got a surprise
for you.

01:51.567 --> 01:52.667
Oh, you do?

01:52.702 --> 01:54.035
- I do.
- What?

01:54.070 --> 01:56.037
Honey,
it's a pretty good surprise.

01:57.206 --> 01:58.607
Shh, don't wake Gracie.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.108
Gracie's sleeping.

02:00.142 --> 02:03.178
What are you doing here?

02:03.212 --> 02:05.180
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:05.214 --> 02:07.883
You're not supposed to be back
for another week or so.

02:07.917 --> 02:09.484
I know, but I finished
my exams early,

02:09.518 --> 02:11.186
so I thought
I'd come home early.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.354
Oh, you're here.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.148
Hey, hey, can you please
get off my grass, sir?

02:40.182 --> 02:41.549
Thank you.

02:41.584 --> 02:43.318
I know you're just trying
to do your job.

02:43.352 --> 02:45.253
And, please,
go sign in up front.

02:45.288 --> 02:46.321
Thank you very much.

02:46.355 --> 02:48.256
Hey, Taylor!

02:48.291 --> 02:50.358
What in the hell is all this?

02:50.393 --> 02:52.527
It's State, Levi.
Get used to it.

02:52.561 --> 02:54.763
No, no, I'll never
get used to this.

02:54.797 --> 02:56.131
I bet you will.

02:56.165 --> 02:58.500
Hey, come on, you got to move
around the other side!

02:58.534 --> 02:59.901
Ma'am, can you get
this gentleman...

02:59.936 --> 03:01.569
Sir, get him off my grass.

03:01.604 --> 03:02.837
I greatly appreciate it.

03:02.872 --> 03:04.706
- Help save the Lions.
- Come on, everybody.

03:04.740 --> 03:08.009
Sign the petition.
Come on, support your Lions.

03:08.044 --> 03:10.245
As many people as possible.
Thank you.

03:10.279 --> 03:11.646
If you can come
to the hearing...

03:12.915 --> 03:14.215
Please bring a friend too.
<i>Amigas...</i>

03:14.250 --> 03:15.750
Thank you so much.

03:15.785 --> 03:17.686
Please come.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.487
We need a babysitter,

03:19.522 --> 03:21.756
because all these...
All these women are moms.

03:21.791 --> 03:24.292
And... and so if we had someone
outside watching,

03:24.327 --> 03:25.694
then all these moms
could go inside.

03:25.728 --> 03:27.028
Yeah, that's great.
I mean, we could just get Jess.

03:27.063 --> 03:28.396
What?
Get Jess what?

03:28.431 --> 03:29.764
- Me? This Jess?
- Yeah, you know anybody

03:29.799 --> 03:31.266
that could babysit
so the moms could come

03:31.300 --> 03:32.701
to the hearing?

03:32.735 --> 03:34.469
I'm looking at two pretty
ladies who could babysit.

03:34.503 --> 03:36.237
Why don't y'all do it?
Learn how to nurse a baby.

03:36.272 --> 03:37.672
Get some milk...
Simple.

03:37.707 --> 03:38.974
All right.
I'll see ya.

03:39.008 --> 03:40.542
No, but what we need to do,
we need to start passing

03:40.576 --> 03:41.910
- out these flyers everywhere.
- Oh, yeah.

03:41.944 --> 03:43.578
You coming down to
Ray's barbeque to help us out?

03:43.612 --> 03:45.680
I can't because coach set up
a recruiting meeting for me.

03:45.715 --> 03:47.182
- That's... that's good.
- Yeah.

03:47.216 --> 03:49.918
- All right, what... what college?
- Warren Field State.

03:49.952 --> 03:51.886
- That's great.
- It's a D-3 school.

03:51.921 --> 03:53.855
They're putting together
a good program and stuff.

03:53.889 --> 03:55.156
Yeah, they got
some good players, man.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.725
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- Cool.

03:56.759 --> 03:59.060
All right.

03:59.095 --> 04:03.264
Okay, let's see
what's going on here.

04:03.299 --> 04:06.434
You see that?

04:06.469 --> 04:08.236
- That's our baby?
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.270 --> 04:10.605
Aah!

04:10.639 --> 04:12.374
That's our baby, baby.

04:12.408 --> 04:14.843
Okay.

04:14.877 --> 04:16.745
What do we have here?

04:16.779 --> 04:18.880
Oh.

04:18.914 --> 04:21.716
Congratulations.
It's twins.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.518
Twins?
We're having twins?

04:23.552 --> 04:25.020
- We're having twins?
- You are.

04:25.054 --> 04:26.287
Are you kidding me?

04:26.322 --> 04:27.722
- Twins!
- Oh!

04:27.757 --> 04:28.957
- Twins.
- Mwah.

04:28.991 --> 04:30.892
Tw... twins.

04:30.926 --> 04:34.396
Twins.

04:35.765 --> 04:38.433
What are you doing
on this side?

04:38.467 --> 04:41.770
I snuck down here because...

04:41.804 --> 04:43.938
I have not been able
to talk to you about my trip,

04:43.973 --> 04:45.940
and it's driving me crazy.

04:45.975 --> 04:50.011
Honey, they offered me
the dean of admissions.

04:51.647 --> 04:53.515
- The dean?
- Yes.

04:53.549 --> 04:56.384
They're suggesting
that they will replace

04:56.419 --> 04:59.554
the present dean with me.

04:59.588 --> 05:01.990
And I'd like to do it.

05:02.024 --> 05:05.927
That's in Philadelphia.

05:05.961 --> 05:08.663
I know.

05:08.697 --> 05:10.765
I know.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.768
Well, that's a long commute.

05:13.803 --> 05:17.672
Well, we'd have to move
to Philadelphia.

05:17.706 --> 05:21.509
We live in Texas.

05:26.415 --> 05:29.217
Honey, Texas...

05:29.251 --> 05:30.952
Is where our friends
and family are.

05:30.986 --> 05:33.688
Texas is where I work.

05:33.722 --> 05:36.291
Texas is where I have my job.

05:36.325 --> 05:37.559
I know, babe.

05:37.593 --> 05:40.728
But I feel like this is...

05:40.763 --> 05:42.564
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime

05:42.598 --> 05:45.333
and...

05:45.367 --> 05:47.302
And an opportunity
for us to think

05:47.336 --> 05:51.339
about how we make decisions
for our family.

05:51.373 --> 05:54.709
Also, it seems kind of like
the timing might be good,

05:54.743 --> 05:56.478
in terms of...

05:56.512 --> 05:59.247
Everything
that's going on and...

05:59.281 --> 06:03.585
I mean, I just think it'd be
great for us to talk about.

06:05.521 --> 06:06.888
I don't want to talk
about this.

06:06.922 --> 06:08.289
I can't talk about it
right now.

06:10.626 --> 06:14.496
How many times
have we moved before...

06:14.530 --> 06:16.631
For your job?

06:22.037 --> 06:32.637
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

07:18.227 --> 07:20.595
Hey.

07:23.832 --> 07:24.697
Beer.

07:27.603 --> 07:30.338
You think you could come
over here and talk to me?

07:33.175 --> 07:36.244
Tim...

07:36.278 --> 07:37.645
Could you please
just come here...

07:37.680 --> 07:39.147
You want me to talk to you?
Let's talk.

07:39.181 --> 07:40.481
- Yes, please.
- Let's talk, Billy.

07:40.516 --> 07:42.083
- Talk to me.
- Go ahead. Shoot.

07:42.117 --> 07:43.718
You're my brother, okay?

07:43.752 --> 07:46.154
And this can't keep going on
like this.

07:46.188 --> 07:48.790
It's stupid.

07:48.824 --> 07:50.325
So just come home.

07:50.359 --> 07:52.694
I'm moving to Alaska.

07:52.728 --> 07:56.664
I'm gonna work the pipelines
there when my parole's up.

07:56.699 --> 07:58.399
What the hell
are you gonna do in Alaska?

07:58.434 --> 07:59.901
You're gonna freeze
your ass off.

07:59.935 --> 08:01.869
What, did you see
some stupid infomercial

08:01.904 --> 08:03.304
the other night or something?

08:03.339 --> 08:05.840
No, actually, a guy came
to speak to us at the prison.

08:05.874 --> 08:07.675
Said there's a lot
of opportunities there, so...

08:07.710 --> 08:09.043
There's no opportunities
in Alaska.

08:09.078 --> 08:10.411
What the hell
are you gonna do there, Tim?

08:10.446 --> 08:12.046
What, are you gonna sleep
with a bunch of woodchucks?

08:12.081 --> 08:13.715
There's no woodchucks
in Alaska that I know of.

08:13.749 --> 08:15.917
Okay, moose, Tim.
I don't know. Whatever.

08:15.951 --> 08:18.753
All right?
It's frickin' ridiculous.

08:18.787 --> 08:21.122
What are you gonna do
with your land, hmm?

08:21.156 --> 08:23.057
I'm selling it.

08:23.092 --> 08:24.392
You're gonna sell your land,

08:24.426 --> 08:25.760
and you're
just gonna leave Texas?

08:28.297 --> 08:29.597
Yes.

08:36.105 --> 08:38.773
Whatever.

08:42.977 --> 08:44.679
Da...
Oh, come on!

08:44.713 --> 08:46.848
Hey.

08:46.882 --> 08:48.416
Are you okay?

08:48.450 --> 08:50.418
It's broken.

08:50.452 --> 08:51.619
It won't close.

08:51.654 --> 08:52.954
Hey.
Hey, hey.

08:52.988 --> 08:54.822
Shh, shh, shh.

08:58.727 --> 09:02.363
Don't be nice to me.

09:02.398 --> 09:04.399
I don't need nobody being nice.

09:04.433 --> 09:07.101
I need people to be fair.

09:07.136 --> 09:11.039
I wanted this my whole life.

09:11.073 --> 09:15.176
And I finally found a coach
who's open-minded enough

09:15.210 --> 09:19.280
to take a girl in
without laughing at her.

09:19.315 --> 09:22.317
He lets me learn from him

09:22.351 --> 09:25.253
and shadow him.

09:25.287 --> 09:28.589
And he teaches me
how to be a coach.

09:28.624 --> 09:32.226
And now they gonna take it
all away.

09:32.261 --> 09:34.262
I mean, if the Lions are done,

09:34.296 --> 09:37.532
then I'm done.

09:37.566 --> 09:41.302
Then we won't let that happen.

09:45.607 --> 09:47.608
Oh, that is good pudding.

09:47.643 --> 09:49.377
Yeah, I love a good pudding.

09:49.411 --> 09:51.346
So we have
an eight-game schedule.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.082
We play most of our games
in Arkansas.

09:54.116 --> 09:57.485
But we do get to go
to Oklahoma every other year.

09:57.519 --> 09:58.920
Oh.

09:58.954 --> 10:01.389
Yeah, now, most of the boys,
they do play both ways, too,

10:01.423 --> 10:02.690
just like you.

10:02.725 --> 10:05.860
Matter of fact, some of the boys
even play basketball.

10:05.894 --> 10:08.062
Oak bluff's a great little town.
It's got a lot of heart.

10:08.097 --> 10:10.365
We just got us a Costco
last year,

10:10.399 --> 10:13.568
and they just put in
a brand-new movie theater

10:13.602 --> 10:15.036
out by the reservoir.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.571
Do you like to go fishing?

10:16.605 --> 10:20.041
Um, yeah, pro...
I probably do.

10:20.075 --> 10:21.709
Fantastic.
You come out and see us.

10:21.744 --> 10:23.378
We'll take you out there
on the bass boat, all right?

10:23.412 --> 10:25.046
18-footer.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.115
Reel in some state records.
How does that sound?

10:27.149 --> 10:30.151
That sounds perfect.

10:30.185 --> 10:31.386
Now, here's the book.

10:31.420 --> 10:33.221
- Take a look at it, okay?
- Okay.

10:33.255 --> 10:35.156
If you have any questions,
feel free to just let me know,

10:35.190 --> 10:36.624
- okay?
- Thank you very much.

10:36.658 --> 10:38.126
Yeah, yeah, we'd love
to see you out there, though.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.327
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

10:39.361 --> 10:41.662
Thank you.

10:41.697 --> 10:44.298
Let's go, boys.
Yeah! Let's go, boys.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.566
Let's do this.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.068
I know. I know.
Let's go.

10:47.102 --> 10:49.737
Listen, we all know there's
a lot going on off the field

10:49.772 --> 10:50.938
for this team right now.

10:50.973 --> 10:52.440
It seems like
the last couple days, though,

10:52.474 --> 10:54.442
Vince has really taken it
upon himself

10:54.476 --> 10:56.477
to make sure this team
does not get distracted.

10:56.512 --> 10:59.614
Are you worried
he's taking on too much?

10:59.648 --> 11:01.015
No, I don't...
I don't have to worry

11:01.049 --> 11:02.417
about Vince Howard
taking on too much.

11:02.451 --> 11:04.619
He's taking over,
and he's leading the team.

11:04.653 --> 11:06.487
He's doing
what I want him to do.

11:06.522 --> 11:08.923
Look, the one thing
about Vince Howard is

11:08.957 --> 11:10.425
that we haven't even scratched
the surface

11:10.459 --> 11:11.592
on what the kid can do.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.094
You know him.
You've talked to him.

11:13.128 --> 11:14.929
- He's a smart kid.
- What... what about you?

11:14.963 --> 11:16.831
Are... are you having a hard time
staying focused?

11:16.865 --> 11:18.466
I'm not having a hard time
staying focused.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.268
It's like herding cats...
A lot of emotions going on,

11:20.302 --> 11:21.669
but everyone's very fired up.

11:21.703 --> 11:23.905
Hey, listen, I'll talk to you
in a little while, okay?

11:23.939 --> 11:25.072
I'm gonna get out here,
all right?

11:25.107 --> 11:26.340
- Coach, thanks for the time.
- Hey, Luke.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.376
Yes, sir.

11:28.410 --> 11:30.645
How'd it go with coach Buckley?

11:30.679 --> 11:32.847
- Good.
- Yeah?

11:32.881 --> 11:34.415
Mm-hmm.

11:34.450 --> 11:36.417
Well, you know, what was said?

11:36.452 --> 11:37.819
Just... It was great.

11:37.853 --> 11:40.922
They just had a real nice
breakfast and everything.

11:40.956 --> 11:43.991
What'd you...
What'd you talk about?

11:44.026 --> 11:45.326
Did you talk about the program?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.527
- What's going on down there?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:46.562 --> 11:48.129
Just really nice guys,

11:48.163 --> 11:50.198
and they were, like,
passionate about me

11:50.232 --> 11:51.666
and passionate
about the program, so...

11:51.700 --> 11:53.868
You know,
that's all you can ask for.

11:53.902 --> 11:55.636
- Good.
- Yeah.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.372
- Good.
- Thank you so much.

11:58.407 --> 12:00.408
Good.

12:04.079 --> 12:07.615
And it is going to be
a battle royale

12:07.649 --> 12:09.250
at that town hall meeting.

12:09.284 --> 12:11.385
How can the district
say no to a school

12:11.420 --> 12:13.988
that has all the equipment,
all the support,

12:14.022 --> 12:15.756
a jumbotron,
for the love of God?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.799
Buddy, I don't want to be here
any more than you want to see me

12:24.833 --> 12:26.467
at your door,
so just hear me out.

12:26.502 --> 12:28.469
I know which way
the wind's blowing

12:28.504 --> 12:30.004
on this whole budget thing.

12:30.038 --> 12:31.706
And the bottom line is,
come the fall,

12:31.740 --> 12:32.907
there's gonna be a Panthers,

12:32.941 --> 12:35.409
and there ain't gonna be
a Lions.

12:35.444 --> 12:37.478
- Oh, yeah? Is that right?
- That is right.

12:37.513 --> 12:39.013
Yeah, well,
how do you know that, Randy?

12:39.047 --> 12:40.681
I know, Buddy, all right?

12:40.716 --> 12:43.384
The reason I'm here
is to fill you in on something.

12:43.418 --> 12:44.652
It's Dillon.

12:44.686 --> 12:46.554
Dillon is a Panthers town.

12:46.588 --> 12:49.190
That's what the town is about.
That's what everyone's about.

12:49.224 --> 12:50.925
That's what you're about
deep down inside,

12:50.959 --> 12:52.894
if you have a look,
and we believe you still are.

12:52.928 --> 12:55.062
And we want you back,
bottom line,

12:55.097 --> 12:56.330
'cause changes are coming.

12:56.365 --> 12:57.732
We got to make changes
with Mac.

12:57.766 --> 12:59.100
We got to get someone
that's gonna be able

12:59.134 --> 13:00.501
to handle Vince Howard,

13:00.536 --> 13:02.370
'cause Vince Howard
is gonna be a Panther.

13:02.404 --> 13:05.239
Your Panthers
could be the Panthers

13:05.274 --> 13:06.574
you remember and love.

13:06.608 --> 13:08.409
That chair at the head
of the table

13:08.443 --> 13:11.546
is waiting on you.

13:16.618 --> 13:20.621
Hey, Riggins,
you forgot my beer.

13:23.559 --> 13:25.092
You listening?

13:25.127 --> 13:26.527
I've been waiting
five minutes, jailbird.

13:26.562 --> 13:28.963
Come on, man.

13:28.997 --> 13:30.798
Listen to me, Bobby.

13:30.832 --> 13:34.802
You call me that again,
I swear to God I will end you.

13:34.836 --> 13:36.737
Deal?

13:36.772 --> 13:39.407
I've been waiting
for five minutes for my drink.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.114
Hey, there, jailbird.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.987
Move.

14:00.262 --> 14:01.662
Hi.

14:07.769 --> 14:09.670
Hi.

14:12.374 --> 14:16.944
It was a long day.

14:16.979 --> 14:19.347
I'm sorry.

14:19.381 --> 14:22.416
This afternoon I, uh...

14:22.451 --> 14:25.653
I'm having a hard time
wrapping my mind around this.

14:25.687 --> 14:27.521
I understand.

14:27.556 --> 14:30.124
I know how much you want this.

14:30.158 --> 14:32.526
That's not lost on me.

14:32.561 --> 14:35.863
I know how much
this means to you.

14:35.897 --> 14:37.498
I appreciate that.

14:37.532 --> 14:39.100
But I am sorry.

14:39.134 --> 14:42.103
We have got
an obvious problem here.

14:42.137 --> 14:45.172
I don't necessarily see it
as a problem.

14:45.207 --> 14:49.677
I mean, if you look
at the situation

14:49.711 --> 14:51.712
right now with these
football teams in Dillon,

14:51.747 --> 14:53.014
with the Lions,

14:53.048 --> 14:55.182
I mean,
this could be a blessing,

14:55.217 --> 15:00.621
to have this opportunity
to get a real good income in.

15:00.656 --> 15:04.792
So you're rooting against us?

15:04.826 --> 15:07.595
- Is that what you're saying?
- Against "who" us?

15:07.629 --> 15:09.430
Me, against my team.

15:09.464 --> 15:11.399
Oh, the... Oh, the Lions.
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.867
- I should have known.
- That's the team

15:12.901 --> 15:14.001
that I happen
to be the coach of.

15:14.036 --> 15:15.403
Of course you were talking
about the Lions.

15:15.437 --> 15:17.705
I didn't know if you meant us,
you and I,

15:17.739 --> 15:19.340
or us the Lions.

15:19.374 --> 15:21.409
Of course you meant the Lions.

15:21.443 --> 15:22.610
You know what, honey?

15:22.644 --> 15:24.512
I have been a coach's wife
for 18 years.

15:24.546 --> 15:26.714
18...
Well aware of that.

15:26.748 --> 15:28.382
Every decision
this family has made

15:28.417 --> 15:31.318
has been based
on your coaching career.

15:31.353 --> 15:34.655
I don't see why we can't look

15:34.690 --> 15:37.658
at something else
beyond football,

15:37.693 --> 15:40.428
especially because it's not just
an opportunity for me.

15:40.462 --> 15:43.464
This is an opportunity
for our family.

15:43.498 --> 15:48.002
Can't we even have
that conversation?

15:48.036 --> 15:50.304
Yeah.

16:07.723 --> 16:10.725
Mindy's all mad at me
since I've only been home

16:10.759 --> 16:14.261
to visit once
since Stevie's been born.

16:14.296 --> 16:16.897
So why don't you
just come home more?

16:16.932 --> 16:18.999
'Cause I don't like
coming home, Tim.

16:20.769 --> 16:22.470
Well, I guess she's gonna
need help with the twins

16:22.504 --> 16:24.805
once they're born.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.874
Twins?

16:26.908 --> 16:28.242
Yeah.

16:28.276 --> 16:31.545
Billy didn't tell you?

16:31.580 --> 16:33.280
No.

16:35.517 --> 16:38.452
We haven't been talking much.

16:39.988 --> 16:43.491
Hey, look,
I got to clock back in.

16:43.525 --> 16:45.960
Hey, uh, it's good to see you.

16:45.994 --> 16:49.430
And thanks for writing.

16:49.464 --> 16:52.566
It meant a lot.

16:52.601 --> 16:54.769
Billy didn't come see you?

16:54.803 --> 16:55.903
No, he saw me.

16:55.937 --> 16:59.440
He took real good care of me.

17:08.683 --> 17:11.452
What the hell
are you doing, sweetie?

17:11.486 --> 17:14.588
- He's not gonna know who I am.
- What?

17:14.623 --> 17:19.160
I'm gonna be knee-deep
in infant-toddler crap... twins,

17:19.194 --> 17:21.028
and Stevie's not gonna
even know who I am,

17:21.061 --> 17:24.131
and he's gonna grow up
and not remember me.

17:24.165 --> 17:26.099
And we don't even have any place
to put 'em.

17:26.134 --> 17:27.434
- Hey. Hey.
- We're gonna have to put 'em

17:27.469 --> 17:29.036
in a tent,
and then we'll live in a tent,

17:29.070 --> 17:31.138
because we can't afford
to have any more babies.

17:31.173 --> 17:33.140
No one's going out
and living in a tent.

17:33.175 --> 17:35.276
We got
a three-bedroom house here.

17:35.310 --> 17:36.777
All right?

17:36.812 --> 17:40.614
A-and second of all...

17:40.649 --> 17:43.450
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:43.485 --> 17:44.819
Hey.

17:44.853 --> 17:47.154
Look, I-I'm gonna be coaching
again next year,

17:47.189 --> 17:48.656
and everything's gonna be fine.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.357
How do you even know
there's gonna be

17:50.392 --> 17:52.059
- a football team next year?
- Don't say that.

17:52.093 --> 17:53.794
There's gonna be
a football team...

17:53.829 --> 17:55.629
All right?

17:55.664 --> 17:57.364
I'm gonna take care of you.

17:57.399 --> 17:59.466
Have I always taken care
of you?

17:59.501 --> 18:01.802
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:01.837 --> 18:05.372
Hey, come here.

18:05.407 --> 18:06.874
It's gonna be okay...

18:06.908 --> 18:09.109
Okay?

18:09.144 --> 18:12.012
- I know.
- Here.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.280
Hey, fellas, listen up!

18:13.315 --> 18:14.381
- Bring it in!
- Listen up!

18:14.416 --> 18:16.317
Listen up.
Good practice.

18:16.351 --> 18:17.551
Let's keep working hard.

18:17.586 --> 18:19.353
Go home and get your rest.

18:19.387 --> 18:21.355
- See you in the morning.
- See you in the morning!

18:21.389 --> 18:23.190
Let's go!
Let's go!

18:23.225 --> 18:25.759
Great!
Great practice, guys.

18:25.794 --> 18:27.995
Looks like State champions
right there.

18:28.029 --> 18:29.530
- Buddy, how you doing?
- I'm good.

18:29.564 --> 18:31.232
I'm good.
The team looks great.

18:31.266 --> 18:33.200
- They really do.
- They look great.

18:33.235 --> 18:34.768
Hey, I want to ask you
something.

18:34.803 --> 18:35.836
- Yeah.
- I just want to know

18:35.871 --> 18:36.971
if you've been thinking
about it.

18:37.005 --> 18:39.039
I just want to know
what you think

18:39.074 --> 18:41.876
about if things don't go our way
at the Town Hall meeting.

18:43.745 --> 18:45.246
Well,
I'm under the consideration

18:45.280 --> 18:46.380
that things will go our way.

18:46.414 --> 18:47.982
Well, I am too.
I hope they do.

18:48.016 --> 18:49.750
But if they don't...
if they don't go our way,

18:49.784 --> 18:51.252
what I'm guessing
is they're gonna take

18:51.286 --> 18:52.486
the best of the Panthers,

18:52.520 --> 18:54.221
they're gonna take the best
from the Lions,

18:54.256 --> 18:55.689
and they're gonna create
a super team,

18:55.724 --> 18:56.957
is what they're gonna do.

18:56.992 --> 18:59.460
And I want you to just think
about what that would be

18:59.494 --> 19:00.728
if we had the facilities,

19:00.762 --> 19:02.730
and we had the backing
of Dillon.

19:02.764 --> 19:04.331
Oh, I think Mac will do
a fine job over there.

19:04.366 --> 19:05.766
That's what I think.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.135
Well, I think they're not
gonna consider Mac at all,

19:08.169 --> 19:10.905
and I think you know that.

19:10.939 --> 19:13.474
That's what I think.

19:15.176 --> 19:18.045
I'm running late.
I got to pick up Gracie.

19:21.216 --> 19:24.018
Nice, mom.

19:24.052 --> 19:25.486
Quick question...

19:25.520 --> 19:27.588
What's the plan, son,
for next year?

19:27.622 --> 19:29.490
You got a baby
and two more on the way.

19:29.524 --> 19:31.158
What are y'all gonna do
for money?

19:33.228 --> 19:35.129
Well, I was thinking
I'd be coaching.

19:35.163 --> 19:38.265
Well, I know, but I've been
listening to the radio,

19:38.300 --> 19:41.101
and it doesn't seem like
East Dillon's gonna have a team.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.603
You need to stop listening
to the radio.

19:42.637 --> 19:43.837
We're gonna win State.

19:43.872 --> 19:45.706
There ain't any way in hell

19:45.740 --> 19:47.374
that anybody in Texas
is gonna get rid

19:47.409 --> 19:48.776
of a football team
that wins State.

19:48.810 --> 19:51.045
Luke says that the defense
is unstoppable.

19:51.079 --> 19:52.446
Yeah, well, Luke's right.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.382
- Who's Luke?
- I saw Tim yesterday.

19:55.417 --> 19:56.917
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

19:56.952 --> 19:58.819
He tell you about his, uh,
plans to move to Alaska?

19:58.853 --> 20:00.054
What?

20:00.088 --> 20:02.890
What... what is Tim Riggins
gonna do in Alaska?

20:02.924 --> 20:04.725
He's got
some stupid-ass idea

20:04.759 --> 20:06.894
that he's gonna move to Alaska
and work on the pipeline.

20:06.928 --> 20:09.630
The kid loves Texas, all right?

20:09.664 --> 20:10.731
It's not gonna happen.

20:10.765 --> 20:12.800
He's just having
a little tough time,

20:12.834 --> 20:15.102
you know, readjusting.

21:03.485 --> 21:05.252
Whose truck is that?

21:05.286 --> 21:07.454
Billy's.

21:07.489 --> 21:08.856
Look, I need to talk to you.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.591
There's a lot of things

21:10.625 --> 21:13.227
that I need to explain to you.

21:13.261 --> 21:15.729
And I'd kind of appreciate it

21:15.764 --> 21:18.432
if you'd put the wrench down
and listen to me.

21:18.466 --> 21:21.735
All right,
but I'm working here, so...

21:21.770 --> 21:24.371
Well, fine.
I'll make it quick.

21:24.406 --> 21:27.241
You have no idea
how lonely I was

21:27.275 --> 21:29.076
when I was living with my mom.

21:29.110 --> 21:31.779
Half the time, it was like
I was just in the way.

21:31.813 --> 21:34.748
And it's not like when I live
with Billy and Mindy.

21:34.783 --> 21:36.517
It's not like home.

21:36.551 --> 21:40.254
And then Tim moved in,
and he talked to me,

21:40.288 --> 21:42.756
and he hung out with me,
and he was a friend to me.

21:42.791 --> 21:44.558
And when everything happened
with me and you,

21:44.592 --> 21:47.027
he was there for me,
and he helped me.

21:47.062 --> 21:49.596
So, yeah, I love him for that.

21:49.631 --> 21:52.800
And I put him on a pedestal
for that.

21:52.834 --> 21:55.402
But that's not real.

21:55.437 --> 21:59.139
You are.

21:59.174 --> 22:04.078
And I just think there's been
a lot of misunderstandings.

22:04.112 --> 22:05.412
Well, that's really pretty.

22:05.447 --> 22:08.749
You should put that
in a little poem.

22:08.783 --> 22:10.617
Are you kidding me?

22:12.620 --> 22:16.757
Just go to hell.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.325
Go to hell!

22:18.359 --> 22:21.228
I was being honest with you!

22:27.669 --> 22:30.337
Don't speak until you're
given permission to speak!

22:30.371 --> 22:32.573
Last year, you only had
19 kids on your team!

22:32.607 --> 22:35.008
Sit down!

22:35.043 --> 22:37.177
I will close
this entire meeting down

22:37.212 --> 22:40.447
if I can't get
some control here!

22:42.217 --> 22:43.283
Thank you!

22:43.318 --> 22:44.384
Edward, sit down.

22:44.419 --> 22:45.586
Sally, you've got the floor.

22:45.620 --> 22:46.920
Thank you,
Mr. Carville.

22:46.955 --> 22:50.457
If we just look at
this budget crisis as temporary

22:50.492 --> 22:53.260
and the ultimate goal is for
both teams to make it through,

22:53.294 --> 22:55.496
then, you know, one of the teams
doesn't really need the funding,

22:55.530 --> 22:58.832
because most of their resources
come from booster donations.

23:00.401 --> 23:01.568
Our booster program's based

23:01.603 --> 23:03.604
across 60 years
of winning tradition!

23:03.638 --> 23:05.272
Sit down! Sit down!
Sit down!

23:05.306 --> 23:06.507
- You've got the floor.
- Thank you.

23:06.541 --> 23:09.109
Some of us,
on this side of town,

23:09.144 --> 23:10.978
happen to own our houses.

23:11.012 --> 23:13.680
Saying inflammatory remarks...

23:13.715 --> 23:15.582
When was the last time
you all played football

23:15.617 --> 23:17.484
at this time of year?

23:17.519 --> 23:20.354
We're going to State!

23:22.524 --> 23:24.658
State! State! State!
State! State!

23:24.692 --> 23:26.393
Would you get these people
under control?

23:26.427 --> 23:28.428
The meeting is adjourned!
That is it!

23:28.463 --> 23:30.364
Let's go. Shut it down.
Shut it down.

23:35.770 --> 23:38.872
"Concerns about my financial
future lead me to ask..."

23:38.907 --> 23:41.341
Damn it.

23:41.376 --> 23:44.511
"Concerns about my financial
future in the football landscape

23:44.546 --> 23:46.513
of next season..."

23:46.548 --> 23:48.582
Whoa, damn it!

23:48.616 --> 23:50.517
Holy...

23:52.353 --> 23:54.988
Concerns about
my financial future lead me

23:55.023 --> 23:56.990
to ask you where you see me
in the football landscape

23:57.025 --> 23:59.026
of next season.

24:09.537 --> 24:12.973
The football landscape's
a little bit blurry right now.

24:14.642 --> 24:19.046
I have twins coming
on the way soon, so...

24:19.080 --> 24:22.749
I know.

24:22.784 --> 24:25.852
Damn it. I wish I could be
more definitive,

24:25.887 --> 24:27.888
but I can't, and I'm sorry.

24:27.922 --> 24:31.725
I don't know.

24:31.759 --> 24:34.361
Okay.

24:34.395 --> 24:36.430
Thank you.

24:43.871 --> 24:45.672
What can I do you for?

24:45.707 --> 24:47.874
Cheeseburger...

24:47.909 --> 24:49.376
And a coke.

24:49.410 --> 24:50.677
Sure.

24:50.712 --> 24:52.546
Anything else?

24:52.580 --> 24:55.916
You and Becky, uh...

24:55.950 --> 24:57.784
Are you in love with her?

24:59.554 --> 25:02.389
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

25:02.423 --> 25:05.459
No.
I'm not in love with Becky.

25:05.493 --> 25:08.328
I care about her.

25:08.363 --> 25:10.230
And I've been there a few times
when no one else was,

25:10.265 --> 25:12.266
but that's about it.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.468
Any other questions?

25:14.502 --> 25:18.138
No.

25:18.172 --> 25:20.307
Are you sure?

25:20.341 --> 25:23.443
Yeah, you ever hear
of Warren Field State?

25:23.478 --> 25:26.413
No. Why?

25:26.447 --> 25:27.581
It's a D-3 school.

25:27.615 --> 25:30.350
It's... it's pretty much
my future.

25:30.385 --> 25:32.653
Congratulations.

25:32.687 --> 25:34.621
I love football more than
anything in the world, you know?

25:34.656 --> 25:37.124
I love it.

25:37.158 --> 25:39.993
But Warren Field State's not
giving me, like, that feeling.

25:40.028 --> 25:42.262
Yeah.

25:42.297 --> 25:46.633
Let me give you
some advice, Luke.

25:48.836 --> 25:51.838
You're going to State, correct?

25:51.873 --> 25:53.106
Yeah.

25:53.141 --> 25:56.476
Nothing's gonna be
bigger than that.

25:56.511 --> 26:00.013
Play it that way.

26:00.048 --> 26:03.650
Play it like it's the last time
you're ever gonna lace up.

26:03.685 --> 26:06.787
Then let it go...

26:06.821 --> 26:10.324
And move on.

26:10.358 --> 26:12.726
That's my advice.

26:16.464 --> 26:19.132
Mr. Carville.

26:19.167 --> 26:20.634
Come in.
Have a seat, guys.

26:20.668 --> 26:22.969
Okay.
Thanks.

26:25.673 --> 26:28.475
I know you've been waiting
a long time to talk to me.

26:28.509 --> 26:32.112
But, please,
just make it concise.

26:32.146 --> 26:34.715
W-we were at the meeting
last night.

26:34.749 --> 26:36.683
But... but we're not here
to argue or yell.

26:36.718 --> 26:38.352
We just want to give you
our thoughts.

26:38.386 --> 26:42.189
- Yeah.
- That'd be refreshing...

26:42.223 --> 26:44.157
Mr. Howard.

26:44.192 --> 26:46.827
Okay, uh...

26:46.861 --> 26:49.596
Before football,
I was going nowhere fast...

26:49.630 --> 26:51.732
Straight to juvie.

26:51.766 --> 26:54.201
Playing
for the East Dillon Lions

26:54.235 --> 26:56.303
probably saved my life.

26:56.337 --> 26:59.840
I got a bond with my teammates
that'll never be broken.

26:59.874 --> 27:03.510
I got a coach that's been
like a father to me.

27:03.544 --> 27:07.848
He shows up and gives 100%
every game, every practice.

27:07.882 --> 27:11.918
Mr. Carville, it's more
than just a game to us.

27:11.953 --> 27:14.287
Football is our life.

27:17.091 --> 27:19.426
Thank you.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.795
This was the best part
of my day.

27:26.134 --> 27:28.268
So let me get this straight.

27:28.302 --> 27:30.203
You're basically squatting
on this land,

27:30.238 --> 27:33.140
living in a trailer
that isn't yours,

27:33.174 --> 27:35.776
moving to Alaska,

27:35.810 --> 27:38.145
and not talking
to your brother.

27:40.381 --> 27:41.782
Was it really that bad?

27:41.816 --> 27:44.351
If you're asking
if I was raped in prison,

27:44.385 --> 27:46.386
Tyra, the answer is no.

27:46.421 --> 27:50.490
Well, that's good to know.
Thank you.

27:50.525 --> 27:53.293
What the hell
is going on with you?

27:53.327 --> 27:56.029
What are you doing?

28:04.272 --> 28:07.207
Billy started the chop shop.

28:07.241 --> 28:10.277
I had nothing to do with it.

28:10.311 --> 28:13.713
We made it out
to seem like I had everything

28:13.748 --> 28:16.383
to do with it.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.018
Wait, so what you're saying...

28:18.052 --> 28:21.588
What I'm saying is I went
to prison for Billy.

28:21.622 --> 28:23.356
That's what I'm saying.

28:26.627 --> 28:28.094
Why?

28:28.129 --> 28:29.796
Why would you do something
like that?

28:29.831 --> 28:31.665
He had a son,

28:31.699 --> 28:34.835
a wife, a family.

28:34.869 --> 28:38.238
I had the opportunity
to change something,

28:38.272 --> 28:41.842
to give something to Stevie
we never had.

28:41.876 --> 28:44.845
I gave him his father.

28:55.590 --> 28:57.657
Hey.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.693
Hey, babe.

28:59.727 --> 29:02.863
Are you okay?

29:05.533 --> 29:09.069
So how come you're not with dad
at the meeting?

29:09.103 --> 29:13.907
He decided to go on his own.

29:13.941 --> 29:18.578
So, um, when are they
announcing the decision?

29:18.613 --> 29:20.480
I don't know.

29:20.515 --> 29:22.349
I don't know.
Sometime this evening.

29:22.383 --> 29:24.351
It should be soon.

29:27.388 --> 29:30.557
What are you hoping for?

29:32.894 --> 29:36.396
I hope that the Lions
get to stay put.

29:37.932 --> 29:39.399
And I hope that I get

29:39.433 --> 29:43.770
to be dean of admissions
at Braemore College.

29:46.607 --> 29:48.708
Honey, you know
your father and I

29:48.743 --> 29:51.144
love each other
very much, right?

29:54.815 --> 29:57.617
Yeah.

30:20.841 --> 30:23.343
Shh.

30:26.147 --> 30:27.581
Can I have
your attention, please?

30:27.615 --> 30:28.615
Quiet!

30:28.649 --> 30:30.617
After careful consideration

30:30.651 --> 30:33.320
and after a called vote
of five to two,

30:33.354 --> 30:35.922
the school board
has decided that,

30:35.957 --> 30:39.659
due to budgetary concerns
and effective this next year,

30:39.694 --> 30:42.762
there will be
one football program

30:42.797 --> 30:45.231
for all D.I.S.D. residents
to participate in.

30:45.266 --> 30:46.900
And that will be
the Dillon Panthers.

30:49.637 --> 30:54.307
The East Dillon football program
has been eliminated.

31:14.195 --> 31:16.896
Hey, coach.

31:19.934 --> 31:22.502
Let me tell you something.

31:22.536 --> 31:24.404
You're gonna be
the star quarterback

31:24.438 --> 31:27.941
of the Dillon Panthers
next year.

31:27.975 --> 31:30.644
And you are gonna shine.

31:40.621 --> 31:44.224
Still got one more game.
See you at practice tomorrow.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.234
What the hell are you doing?

31:54.268 --> 31:56.302
We need to talk.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.647
Whoo!

32:10.718 --> 32:12.886
Welcome back to Dillon.

32:14.288 --> 32:17.057
No place like it.

32:19.060 --> 32:21.227
You know,
it's kind of like this drug.

32:21.262 --> 32:24.197
When you get outside of it, you
see it for what it really is.

32:24.231 --> 32:25.765
When you're in it,

32:25.800 --> 32:28.234
it seems like there's
no other possible reality.

32:28.269 --> 32:30.970
It's a hard place to shake.

32:31.005 --> 32:35.642
Yeah.
Didn't see that one coming.

32:35.676 --> 32:38.445
So, uh, whatever happened
with you and Matty?

32:38.479 --> 32:39.612
We're good.

32:39.647 --> 32:42.182
I mean, we still talk
every now and then.

32:42.216 --> 32:43.383
He moved to Chicago.

32:43.417 --> 32:47.053
I went to visit him
a while back, and...

32:47.088 --> 32:52.192
I don't really know
what we are or aren't or...

32:52.226 --> 32:56.296
I just kind of really miss him.

32:58.399 --> 33:01.601
Life's harder
when you really love someone.

33:07.408 --> 33:11.211
You did your best.

33:11.245 --> 33:12.812
The sons of bitches.

33:12.847 --> 33:15.982
Vince Howard is now a Panther.

33:16.016 --> 33:19.652
The sons of bitches.

33:25.326 --> 33:28.194
They got him, but you...

33:28.229 --> 33:30.063
You get them.

33:30.097 --> 33:32.365
You're gonna win
the State Championship.

33:32.399 --> 33:36.770
So next year you go with Vince.

33:36.804 --> 33:38.538
They're gonna want you
for Vince.

33:38.572 --> 33:40.974
You go over there,
they don't get you...

33:41.008 --> 33:42.275
Let me tell you something.

33:42.309 --> 33:45.378
I can never come back
to this school and coach...

33:45.412 --> 33:46.579
Never.

33:46.614 --> 33:48.114
To hell with them.

33:48.149 --> 33:50.049
- That's not you.
- It is me.

33:50.084 --> 33:51.451
- No, that's your pride.
- That's me.

33:51.485 --> 33:52.819
That's not my pride.
That's me talking.

33:52.853 --> 33:55.955
Pretend this.
Just pretend this... Picture this.

33:55.990 --> 33:59.459
Next year you got
all the Dillon players.

33:59.493 --> 34:02.295
You got the Lions with Vince.

34:02.329 --> 34:03.797
You got the facilities.

34:03.831 --> 34:06.232
You got all the money
you'll ever need.

34:06.267 --> 34:07.801
And you got the team you need.

34:07.835 --> 34:11.538
And guess what. You've won
two State Championships.

34:11.572 --> 34:13.806
You'll win
three State Championships

34:13.841 --> 34:15.574
when you win next year.

34:15.609 --> 34:18.277
You got three rings
in six years.

34:18.312 --> 34:19.579
That's history.

34:19.612 --> 34:22.315
Nobody's ever done that.

34:23.851 --> 34:26.753
You got everything you want.

34:26.786 --> 34:29.922
You're a son of a bitch.

34:45.940 --> 34:48.373
- Aah!
- Shut up and sit down.

34:51.478 --> 34:53.545
It's just like Camelot, guys!

34:53.581 --> 34:55.248
How is it like Camelot?

34:55.282 --> 34:56.983
You don't read much, do you?

34:57.016 --> 34:58.151
All right, guys.

34:58.185 --> 35:01.087
I'm taking a piece
of the grass home.

35:01.121 --> 35:02.322
Yeah!

35:02.356 --> 35:04.624
My blood, sweat, and tears
is in this grass.

35:04.658 --> 35:05.758
And, Tink, you're an idiot.

35:05.793 --> 35:07.760
I'm gonna take a piece
of it home

35:07.795 --> 35:09.762
and plant it in my front yard,

35:09.797 --> 35:11.297
so I can have it
for a lifetime.

35:11.332 --> 35:12.899
No, no, no.
No, I want one too.

35:12.933 --> 35:14.434
Cut me a piece of this grass.

35:14.468 --> 35:15.869
You know what?

35:15.903 --> 35:17.837
There's one thing
they can't take away from us...

35:17.872 --> 35:19.339
What we did on this field.

35:19.373 --> 35:20.740
Tink's right.
Tink's right.

35:20.774 --> 35:22.408
Blood, sweat, and tears.

35:22.443 --> 35:24.944
This has been
the best year and a half

35:24.979 --> 35:27.180
of my entire life, with y'all.

35:27.214 --> 35:29.582
And now we're going to State,
and we're going all the way,

35:29.617 --> 35:31.050
and nothing's gonna stop us.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.653
- And then I'm done with football.
- Yeah, right.

35:33.687 --> 35:34.988
- You got Warren Field State.
- You're going to Warren.

35:35.022 --> 35:36.956
Man, I don't give a crap
about Warren Field, man.

35:36.991 --> 35:38.725
- I've got State.
- All right.

35:38.759 --> 35:39.993
- To State.
- To State, then.

35:40.027 --> 35:40.994
Coach Taylor, baby.

35:41.028 --> 35:42.929
- To the Lions!
- Lions!

35:42.963 --> 35:44.731
- The Lions!
- Coach Taylor.

35:44.765 --> 35:47.033
To the Lions.

35:47.067 --> 35:50.570
Oh!
That's what happens in Camelot.

35:53.007 --> 35:54.040
Oh, I got this.

35:54.074 --> 35:56.075
Oh.
Oh.

35:56.110 --> 35:57.911
Somebody try and stop me!

35:57.945 --> 36:00.413
- Touchdown!
- Get him! Get him! Get him!

36:00.447 --> 36:03.216
- Score!
- Yeah!

36:11.392 --> 36:12.892
You know, Tim,

36:12.927 --> 36:15.094
I can't imagine

36:15.129 --> 36:17.931
how much you'd have
to love Billy

36:17.965 --> 36:20.600
to do what you did.

36:20.634 --> 36:23.569
Just make sure you're
really okay with losing him.

36:23.604 --> 36:26.673
He's your family.

36:26.707 --> 36:30.710
He's been your only family.

36:30.744 --> 36:32.946
Not many people
believed in you, Tim,

36:32.980 --> 36:35.815
but he has.

36:39.486 --> 36:42.221
Okay.

36:56.804 --> 36:57.837
Tyra.

37:10.517 --> 37:13.286
Don't go.

37:17.391 --> 37:18.992
Please don't go.

37:51.558 --> 37:53.993
It's not the Lions.

37:54.028 --> 37:56.696
I know.
I heard.

37:56.730 --> 38:00.233
I'm sorry, babe.

38:00.267 --> 38:02.835
They want me to coach
the new team.

38:02.870 --> 38:06.606
- What new team?
- Dillon Panthers.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.908
It's the best of both teams...

38:08.942 --> 38:12.578
A conglomeration
of all the best...

38:12.613 --> 38:15.415
And everything
one could wish for.

38:19.853 --> 38:22.722
Everything.

38:25.759 --> 38:28.161
I'm gonna say to you

38:28.195 --> 38:32.732
what you haven't had the grace
to say to me.

38:34.735 --> 38:38.905
Congratulations, Eric.

38:58.325 --> 39:00.126
Mm.

39:03.363 --> 39:05.431
- Hey.
- Mm.

39:05.466 --> 39:07.467
Wake up.

39:07.501 --> 39:08.734
Why?

39:08.769 --> 39:10.403
I want you
to take me someplace.

39:10.437 --> 39:13.739
- Mm. Where?
- It doesn't matter.

39:13.774 --> 39:17.376
I'll tell you
when we're on our way.

39:17.411 --> 39:19.679
- Come on. Get dressed.
- All right. I'm up.

39:19.713 --> 39:21.781
- Yep. Come on.
- I'm up.

39:21.815 --> 39:23.015
- Come on.
- I'm up.

39:32.593 --> 39:34.527
Coach know
you going through his stuff?

39:34.561 --> 39:39.432
Oh, well, I was just, like,
putting the folder there.

39:39.466 --> 39:44.170
It feels like everything we
worked for is just disappearing.

39:44.204 --> 39:47.874
Yeah, I guess it does.

39:49.610 --> 39:51.444
What about you and me?

39:51.478 --> 39:55.481
You know, I was really proud
of how hard you tried.

39:57.518 --> 39:58.985
Thank you.

39:59.019 --> 40:02.355
Well, I was a jerk, you know.

40:02.389 --> 40:04.357
I lost myself.

40:04.391 --> 40:08.327
Let a lot of stuff
go to my head.

40:08.362 --> 40:09.695
I'm sorry.

40:09.730 --> 40:12.932
You know, Vince,
you got something in you

40:12.966 --> 40:14.567
that I love.

40:14.601 --> 40:18.070
And then sometimes
some other stuff comes out.

40:18.105 --> 40:20.706
And it hurts.

40:23.243 --> 40:24.677
Well, what if I could promise

40:24.711 --> 40:29.248
that guy
won't come back anymore?

40:29.283 --> 40:32.585
You already got two strikes
against you.

40:32.619 --> 40:35.955
Jess, I was born
with two strikes against me.

41:02.749 --> 41:04.784
Alaska, Tim?

41:23.237 --> 41:25.104
Hello?

41:25.138 --> 41:27.106
Hey.

41:27.140 --> 41:29.141
- It's me.
- Who is it?

41:29.176 --> 41:31.110
It's me.
It's Matthew, grandma.

41:31.144 --> 41:32.411
- Matthew?
- Matthew.

41:32.446 --> 41:33.846
- I got us...
- Is that really you?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.481
It's really me.
I got us a big Christmas tree.

41:35.515 --> 41:37.149
- Is that really you?
- It's really me.

41:37.184 --> 41:39.518
- Heather!
- It's me. Give me a hug.

41:39.553 --> 41:41.654
- How are you?
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you!

41:41.688 --> 41:44.457
Happy Christmas.
You okay?

41:44.491 --> 41:46.993
- Yeah.
- Are you surprised?

41:47.027 --> 41:48.761
- I'm so surprised.
- Good.

41:48.795 --> 41:50.096
I didn't know
you were coming home.

41:50.130 --> 41:51.397
- Well, good.
- Did you tell your daddy

41:51.431 --> 41:52.732
you were home?

41:52.766 --> 41:54.367
Did you tell everybody?

41:54.401 --> 41:56.302
No, you're the only person
who knows.

41:56.336 --> 41:57.937
- I'm the only one.
- It's a surprise.

41:57.971 --> 41:59.272
I'm surprised.

41:59.306 --> 42:01.107
And I'm happy.

42:01.141 --> 42:02.575
- Me too.
- Did you say it was Christmas?

42:02.609 --> 42:05.978
- Yeah, it's Christmas.
- Merry, merry, merry Christmas.

42:06.013 --> 42:07.747
I love you, grandma.

42:07.781 --> 42:10.182
- I love you too.
- I love you.

42:10.217 --> 42:12.618
- I'm glad you're here.
- Yeah.

42:22.863 --> 42:24.430
- Hey, Buddy.
- Tami.

42:24.464 --> 42:26.632
How are you?
Oh, hi, gentlemen.

42:28.101 --> 42:30.236
Might we be able
to speak with Eric?

42:32.439 --> 42:34.307
There he is.

42:39.012 --> 42:40.613
Y'all come in.

42:55.962 --> 42:58.664
18 years.

42:58.699 --> 43:00.966
Can I get y'all anything...
Iced tea, water?
