00:50.926 --> 00:53.010
Nine-ball is rotation pool.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.347
The balls are pocketed
in numbered order.

00:56.932 --> 01:00.727
The only ball that means anything,
that wins it, is the nine.

01:01.937 --> 01:05.480
Now the player can shoot
eight trick shots in a row,

01:05.566 --> 01:07.817
blow the nine and lose.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.739
On the other hand, the player can
get the nine in on the break,

01:13.240 --> 01:15.825
if the balls spread right, and win.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.872
Which is to say that
luck plays a part in nine-ball.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.584
But for some players,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.630
luck itself is an art.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.188
Color.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.484
Check the color. Dead giveaway, huh?

03:14.570 --> 03:17.071
It's so thick you can almost feel it.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.117
Lay down and just let it roll over you.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.036
That's single malt.

03:25.581 --> 03:29.041
Then on the other hand,
you got something like Old McDonnell.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.168
More like Young McDonnell.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.046
Tastes like six-year-old bonded.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.008
Smell this.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.343
Mmm.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.636
Hmm?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.687
- That's good stuff.
- Yeah.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.149
Very good stuff.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.068
I can get you a case of this
for $35.50 less

03:56.153 --> 03:59.030
than your wholesaler will give you
a case of Jack Daniel's.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.574
$45.50 less than he can get you
a case of Wild Turkey.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.744
Why don't you go peddle that
to one of your hotel chains?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.495
Peddle?

04:07.164 --> 04:10.166
I don't do that. Do I do that?
I mean, this is family.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.293
I'm glad to see you, too.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.504
Come to my house tonight
and I'll make you an omelet.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.548
- I make the omelets.
- Okay, you make the omelets.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.176
Did you forget the omelet
I made you last time?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.761
No, I didn't forget.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.096
Yeah, what was it? What was in it?

04:24.181 --> 04:26.098
Eddie.
- Sweet sausage.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.017
Sweet sausage? Hey.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.728
I never made you sweet sausage.
Who the hell made you sweet sausage?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.521
Eddie.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.357
Come on, what was in it?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.775
- Uh, um...
- Sour...

04:35.859 --> 04:38.027
Sour cream and caviar, right?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.987
Okay. Excuse me.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.741
- Eddie.
- Aw, Julian, what am I doing here?

04:43.825 --> 04:46.035
- Am I working?
- I'm working, too.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.747
- I got this guy, he's up to 20 a rack.
- What guy?

04:54.836 --> 04:58.756
Been playing two and a half hours
for five a game. He's up 30.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.424
- So?
- So I've been playing him off.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.051
That's what is up.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.848
Yo, Vincent!

05:08.558 --> 05:10.476
Vincent, we're on!

05:11.728 --> 05:13.729
Hey, Vincent!

05:14.648 --> 05:16.649
Can you believe this guy?

05:18.068 --> 05:19.610
Hey, Vinny.

05:19.695 --> 05:23.572
I mean, you slide some of this stuff into
a bottle of Old Grand-Dad, Wild Turkey,

05:23.657 --> 05:26.659
you'd hardly be lying. Don't even
need iodine. It's a beautiful bourbon.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.703
- Pick me up at 10:00.
- What?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.746
I get off at 10:00.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.207
Not without me, you don't. Do you?

05:34.418 --> 05:38.129
Wait a minute. Come on.
I'm talking bourbon. Okay.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.755
You know the secret?

05:39.881 --> 05:43.009
These people, they get a hold
of aged kegs. What are you tasting?

05:43.093 --> 05:46.554
Tasting low fusel oil content,
low acidic content.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.889
Just like the big guys,
honey, it's the kegs.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.518
Where do you get the kegs?
You don't just get kegs like that, Eddie.

05:52.644 --> 05:53.728
Hey!

05:54.104 --> 05:55.938
That was fast. What the hell happened?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.356
I slipped.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.443
- He slipped.
- Yeah.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.571
Where do they get the kegs?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.281
They just do. That's all.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.241
Okay, listen, do whatever
you want to do.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.118
It's gonna leave the warehouse
one way or the other.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.078
Come on.
On the snap, Vincent!

06:12.664 --> 06:15.374
That kid has got
a sledge-hammer break!

06:17.794 --> 06:19.962
One more night

06:20.380 --> 06:21.756
Bottoms up.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.633
- Do you know who loves this stuff?
- Who?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.636
- The Chinese.
- It must be the low fusel oil content.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.847
Don't kid yourself. It has its effect.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.224
It's just like one of those things
that you never think about,

06:32.559 --> 06:35.561
but it can make your day, like electricity.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.066
- Eddie, throw me another 20.
- Who are you working, me or him?

06:40.150 --> 06:43.319
He's on the ropes, Eddie.
He just lucked out.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.112
You know me, right?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.448
Take it easy.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.124
Victory!

07:00.462 --> 07:04.048
Maybe you're not alone

07:06.510 --> 07:08.511
Pick us out a nice bottle of wine
for tonight, will you?

07:08.595 --> 07:09.845
Red or white?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.972
Come on. On the snap, Vincent!

07:13.475 --> 07:15.935
One more night

07:16.603 --> 07:18.938
'Cause I can't wait forever

07:19.022 --> 07:21.524
- Eddie, about those labels.
- Yeah.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.901
Can you get me
some Wild Turkey labels?

07:25.237 --> 07:26.362
Sure.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.157
Oh, one more night

07:30.408 --> 07:33.702
'Cause I can't wait forever

07:34.621 --> 07:37.289
Give me one more night

07:38.250 --> 07:40.709
Give me just one more night

07:41.586 --> 07:44.130
Give me one more night

07:44.673 --> 07:47.508
I can't wait forever

07:47.676 --> 07:49.677
Hiya. How are you doing?

07:50.554 --> 07:52.930
Like a river to the sea

07:53.640 --> 07:56.684
I will always be with you

07:57.727 --> 08:00.729
And if you sail away

08:01.022 --> 08:03.357
I will follow you

08:04.776 --> 08:07.153
Give me one more night

08:07.237 --> 08:09.822
Give me just one more night

08:09.906 --> 08:12.116
The kid draws some bead, huh?

08:14.703 --> 08:17.705
I can't wait forever

08:19.749 --> 08:22.668
I know there'll never be a time

08:22.752 --> 08:24.628
You'll ever feel the same

08:24.713 --> 08:27.464
Play him again, Julian.
You really got him on the ropes.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.466
One more, right, chief?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.093
Eddie, I got to split.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.096
- You're going?
- I got to see somebody.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.515
Oh, come on, one more game.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.976
- I'm bust.
- So let's just play, play.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.145
- What?
- Let's play for play. No money.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.192
Play, play?

08:46.735 --> 08:49.111
- Show me what you got here.
- Vincent!

08:49.196 --> 08:51.030
Hey, Julian, I just want your best game.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.200
I think maybe the money was
what's throwing you off here today.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.044
Okay, how about I win, no money.
You win, I'll throw you 20.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.633
No?

09:17.015 --> 09:19.058
What's the matter with this guy?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.810
All right, Carmen, who's next?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.937
Nobody?

09:24.314 --> 09:26.982
Hey, excuse me.
Do you want to play me?

09:27.859 --> 09:29.235
For your girlfriend?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.654
No. One game.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.031
I'll spot you the seven and nine.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.658
The seven, eight and nine.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.576
I'll give you the table.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.496
You want to play him?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.164
Me?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.208
Sure.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.836
- Twenty a rack.
- No, 500 a rack.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.507
What? Are you serious?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.969
I never kid about money.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.516
Cowards! Off with their heads.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.064
You don't know what you're doing,
do you?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.400
What do you mean?

10:09.693 --> 10:11.443
You just blew 500 bucks.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.656
That kid, he has both arms in traction,
he beats anybody in the room.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.785
Yeah, he could.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.581
So I'll offer to you again,
I'll play him for 500 bucks.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.585
You don't know what to say, do you?

10:29.337 --> 10:31.297
Maybe I'm hustling you,
maybe I'm not, you don't know.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.589
But you should know.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.341
See, if you know that,
you know when to say yes,

10:34.426 --> 10:35.843
you know when to say no.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.804
Everybody goes home in a limousine.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.389
So what should I say, yes or no?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.057
You should say no.

10:44.227 --> 10:48.063
You know why? 'Cause it's too much
money, and I'm an unknown.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.566
He should be the unknown.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.527
I mean, that would be nice.

10:54.738 --> 10:58.991
That would be beautiful. You could play
around with that, you can control that.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.743
You know what I mean?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.955
I'll offer it to you again.
I'll play him for 500 bucks.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.707
No.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.627
Actually, you should have said yes.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.963
But how are you gonna know that?
I mean, it's very hard to know that,

11:13.048 --> 11:14.465
it's very complex.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.759
It's like, "Which twin has got the Toni?"

11:17.093 --> 11:18.427
Maybe they both got the Toni.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.512
Maybe Toni's a guy.
Maybe Toni's bald, you know.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.097
How you gonna know that?
It's very complicated.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.849
Plus, it's too much money.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.728
- Jesus, you're crazy!
- No, I'm not. Just common sense.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.109
How about I take you guys out
for dinner tonight?

11:36.321 --> 11:40.449
- You should ask Vincent.
- No, you should ask Vincent.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.836
You know the last time
Julian lost for me?

11:52.962 --> 11:55.130
It's just a game, man.
Some balls and a stick.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.966
Balls and a stick. This is Vincent.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.969
Nine-ball's not that tough.
Do you wanna know what's tough?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.805
- Stocker.
- Stocker?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.139
It's his video game.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.558
- Vincent's the best at it.
- I'm the best at it.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.560
I mean, in pool, you just got these balls,

12:08.645 --> 12:11.397
you're just sitting there,
you take your time, you set up the shot.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.731
But Stocker!

12:12.982 --> 12:15.192
Can you make any money
playing Stocker?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.946
I'll tell you what I can do off Stocker.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.572
Ten years from now,
I can get into West Point.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.449
That's what I can do with Stocker.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.993
It's all coming down
to video game reflexes.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.247
I mean, uh, computerized tanks,
Star Wars, you know, that movie.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.250
I mean, 10 years from now,
a guy who scores heavy on Stocker

12:31.334 --> 12:33.168
is a shoo-in at the Point.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.046
You are beautiful.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.633
- You don't believe me?
- What do you mean, money?

12:40.343 --> 12:43.053
- Money, money.
- Really?

12:43.847 --> 12:45.013
Hey, look.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.683
If you got an area of excellence,

12:48.226 --> 12:50.853
if you're good at something,
you're the best at something, anything,

12:51.062 --> 12:54.189
then rich can be arranged.
I mean, rich can come fairly easy.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.108
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.445
You have some other area of excellence
besides this Stocker?

12:59.654 --> 13:01.780
Nine-ball, right?

13:01.948 --> 13:05.200
- You're some piece of work.
- I'm some piece of work.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.618
You're also a natural character.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.496
I've been telling her that.
You know, I got natural character.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.874
No, that's not what I said, kid.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.295
I said you are a natural character.
You're an incredible flake.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.089
But that's a gift.

13:19.340 --> 13:23.343
See, guys spend half their lives
trying to invent something like that.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.263
You walk into a poolroom
with that "go, go, go,"

13:26.347 --> 13:29.141
the guys will be killing each other
trying to get to you.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.186
You got that.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.272
But I'll tell you something, kiddo.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.650
You couldn't find big time
if you had a road map.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.404
Pool excellence is not
about excellent pool.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.531
It's about becoming something.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.533
Yeah?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.744
Yeah.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.956
- Like what?
- A student.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.751
You got to be a student
of human moves.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.504
See, all the greats that I know of,
to a man,

13:58.588 --> 14:00.214
were students of human moves.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.384
- Students of human moves?
- Yeah.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.095
That's my area of excellence.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.139
Oh, yeah?

14:10.225 --> 14:11.350
Yeah.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.814
What?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.107
Okay.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.777
That guy at the end of the bar
in a black suit.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.114
He's been hustling that broad
for half an hour.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.409
He's going to throw in the towel
in 30 seconds for a buck.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.955
You got it, starting now.

14:34.791 --> 14:35.749
Ten seconds.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.626
What do you mean,
rich could be arranged?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.253
Ssh!

14:41.214 --> 14:44.883
...25, 26, 27, 28. Guess the news.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.718
You lose.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.598
Ah. And I just missed it
by a couple of seconds.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.101
Want to up the bet?

14:54.978 --> 14:56.061
Yeah.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.649
Check for the meal says
I leave with her in two minutes.

15:04.654 --> 15:08.031
Okay, ready, go. Now! I'm counting.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.955
I know this is going to sound crazy,
but would you come outside

15:15.039 --> 15:17.082
and take a look at my car?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.960
- Your car?
- Yeah.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.172
Come on.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.928
Hold it here for a second, will you?

15:37.937 --> 15:41.023
Human moves, kid.
You study the watch.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.943
But I study you. You get the check.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.237
Excuse me.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.867
Cab's on me.

15:57.665 --> 16:01.752
- What's with the car, Eddie?
- Nothing. I'll drive you home.

16:01.878 --> 16:06.173
I just hated to see you sitting alone
at the bar, Diane. It's just depressing.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.051
- Did you see Jimmy in there?
- Yeah, I saw him.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.762
Does he still got his nighttime job?

16:12.013 --> 16:14.973
He wanted to talk to you
about something, but you were busy.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.058
Oh, yeah.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.355
Where'd you go?

16:22.565 --> 16:23.774
What?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.276
You certainly weren't here.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.446
Yeah? Where was I?

16:32.575 --> 16:34.451
God, the earth moved.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.037
Didn't it move for you a little bit?

16:37.246 --> 16:38.872
That was a train.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.168
No, it was you.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.716
But it certainly wasn't San Juan.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.388
You want to talk earth moving,
you got to talk San Juan.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.932
Remember that water bed we had?

16:58.601 --> 16:59.643
Gosh!

17:00.895 --> 17:03.188
Sometimes I think about that week,

17:03.439 --> 17:05.898
you know, Eddie,
when I'm behind the bar, I think...

17:06.693 --> 17:09.152
I think,
"I'm gonna go and get me a water bed

17:10.195 --> 17:12.614
"and not tell anybody,
just make it a surprise.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.453
"Get some rum and pineapple juice."

17:20.998 --> 17:24.376
You couldn't tell me one word
I just said, could you?

17:25.294 --> 17:26.712
No, I couldn't.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.923
Water bed, rum, pineapple juice.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.175
It's not that. It's...

17:33.970 --> 17:36.138
I don't know. That kid today.

17:36.639 --> 17:40.267
It was like watching home movies.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.021
It just made me wonder.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.982
Wonder what?

17:48.943 --> 17:51.903
Made me wonder about San Juan.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.836
What did you mean last night
about money and all that stuff?

18:10.965 --> 18:13.216
Come here,
I want to show you something.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.446
- So this is liquor money, huh?
- Some.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.866
I invest. Do you know what I invest in?

18:38.367 --> 18:39.743
Excellence.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.332
- You think Vincent's that good?
- Well...

18:45.708 --> 18:47.876
He's got the eye, he's got the stroke.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.212
He's got the flake.
He's got that down cold.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.465
But can he flake on and flake off,
I don't know.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.384
See, I don't know whether that
can be taught. That's not clear.

18:56.469 --> 19:00.180
He's got to learn how to be himself,
but on purpose.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.017
- Yeah.
- You like to travel?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.478
- Yeah.
- You like hotels?

19:06.771 --> 19:08.772
Yeah, sure, they're okay.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.483
Are you gonna help me with him?

19:16.572 --> 19:19.074
That lady you picked up
last night in the bar.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.952
You knew her from before, right?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.163
Hmm?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.957
And the guy?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.084
You probably had his schedule
down cold, right?

19:29.168 --> 19:32.629
Maybe he works around here
somewhere, he's your brother-in-law?

19:32.713 --> 19:34.464
You're a hard broad.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.092
What does Vincent see in you?

19:37.718 --> 19:41.429
Vincent's the best.
That's what he sees in me.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.766
We've just been together
for about a year.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.018
And Vincent made us
get a place together.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.938
You know how we met?

19:51.691 --> 19:56.236
My old boyfriend last year got busted
breaking into Vincent's parents' house.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.197
We met at the police station,
me and Vincent.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.032
You were bailing him out,
your boyfriend?

20:01.117 --> 20:04.494
No. No, no, no. I got busted, too.
I was driving the car.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.955
See this?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.461
- Vincent's mother's.
- He gave that to you?

20:13.546 --> 20:14.713
No.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.883
From the robbery.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.302
Vince says his mother
has one just like it.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.139
He's sweet.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.851
Vincent's real sweet.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.157
Do you want something
for your kid to bounce in?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.409
What country comes to mind when
you think of bouncing? What animal?

20:44.493 --> 20:45.493
A kangaroo.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.620
Comes from where?
Australia.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.706
That's right, this is Australian-made.
I'll be perfectly honest with you.

20:49.832 --> 20:53.793
It's twice as expensive, but it's three
times better than Taiwan over here.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.004
I'll throw you $15 off on this.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.257
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, we'll do it.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.635
All right, Mr. and Mrs. Randall.
It's a good buy.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.387
Hey, Lou, could you write them up?
Australia, $15 off, all right?

21:04.472 --> 21:05.472
Thank you.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.682
If you ever need anything,
Vincent, okay?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.351
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.812
Mr. Felson, what can I do you for here?

21:12.897 --> 21:14.856
Uh, Eddie is okay.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.233
In fact, just plain Ed, if you want.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.485
Yes, sir.

21:19.487 --> 21:22.197
Me and you, is there someplace private
we can talk?

21:24.450 --> 21:28.286
There's gonna be a nine-ball
tournament end ofApril, Atlantic City.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.831
There will be lot of action there.
I think we ought to go.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.417
- We?
- Yeah, me, you and Carmen.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.127
Yeah?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.879
That sounds like a lot of fun.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.048
The best part is,
we gotta leave tomorrow.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.384
Tomorrow? Why not leave today?

21:42.885 --> 21:46.262
What is it with this guy?
You crack me up.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.014
Vincent,
if you're gonna take the plunge,

21:48.099 --> 21:49.724
give yourself a fair shake.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.228
Now, you go at this thing half-assed,
nobody is going to do any good.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.063
Go on the road, six weeks.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.565
Get some seasoning.
Put together some stuff.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.985
Why don't you ask Julian?
I mean, he'd be into that, right?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.319
Julian is a face. He's known.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.738
You're nobody.
I get better bets with you.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.783
Now, if you know some other way that
I can be honest with you,

22:06.867 --> 22:08.576
you got to tell me.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.746
This is my job, Eddie.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.623
You think so?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.583
Hmm.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.920
That's funny, I don't think so.
I think it's your problem.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.173
What is?

22:22.258 --> 22:25.093
Well, you're hooked on Carmen,
aren't you?

22:27.596 --> 22:28.596
Yeah.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.306
Crazy about her?

22:32.059 --> 22:34.436
You're getting a little personal here.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.151
What?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.486
You're losing her, kiddo.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.238
What do you mean?

22:45.573 --> 22:48.033
She don't get the allure of this place.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.118
- Hey, Vincent!
- Wait.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.204
- What?
- Take a good look at her, Vincent.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.290
She's starting to pack.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.211
You don't know her.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.964
I didn't know that broad
at that bar last night, either.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.008
She's bored, Vincent.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.177
Are you listening to
what I'm telling you?

23:07.261 --> 23:08.261
Vincent!

23:10.097 --> 23:11.389
So what are you saying?

23:11.474 --> 23:15.101
What I'm saying?
You, me, her, on the road, six weeks.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.729
She'll be a couple of years
catching her breath.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.439
Vincent, you know,
these people got a babysitter.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.524
Hey, look,
can't you see I'm talking here?

23:21.609 --> 23:23.818
Do me a favor, will you?
Take care of them!

23:24.737 --> 23:26.905
He's leaving, his coffee break.

23:28.282 --> 23:31.076
Go on, get back to work.
But think about it.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.661
Okay. Take your time.

23:34.038 --> 23:37.123
- I'll give you about five seconds.
- Five seconds.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.668
Listen, you know where to find me,
if you want to talk.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.629
Vincent.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.006
Don't worry about it.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.648
If I could hold you tonight
I might never let go

24:02.024 --> 24:03.942
Anybody asks, I'll be in the back.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.861
If I could hold you tonight
I might never let go

24:10.116 --> 24:11.366
Come on in.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.498
Hey, Eddie.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.421
Uh, I don't know... What we were
talking about yesterday, I just...

24:25.506 --> 24:27.465
I wanted to ask you some questions
about it.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.009
Uh, what happens, you know?

24:31.178 --> 24:33.012
What happens exactly?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.103
Damn.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.772
It's a Balabushka.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.899
It's beautiful.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.570
It makes the other ones
look like stickball bats.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.780
- Is this yours?
- You want it?

24:51.574 --> 24:54.450
No. I can't. This isn't for me.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.911
I don't know who this is for. This is a...

24:58.914 --> 25:01.916
No, this isn't for me.
I don't know.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.503
John Wayne would carry something
like this if he played pool, you know.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.755
Babe Ruth.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.424
Oh, my.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.262
No, I can't accept this.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.055
Go ahead. Take it.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.103
- You're pushing pretty hard.
- You betcha.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.940
I've been thinking
about nothing else all day.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.949
- I don't know what to tell you, Eddie.
- Whatever. It doesn't matter.

25:35.284 --> 25:38.077
Go outside. Horse around with it.
If you don't like it, bring it back.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.793
Eddie, hey, Eddie.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.924
Uh, you know, I was talking to Carmen
the other night, feeling her out.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.551
Willie. Sorry, hold... Wait a minute.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.845
Sorry, go ahead.

25:58.015 --> 26:00.308
I said I was talking to Carmen
the other night, feeling her out.

26:00.643 --> 26:03.269
You know, uh,
I think you're wrong, man.

26:04.146 --> 26:06.898
She's doing good.
She's doing real good.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.359
Okay. I'm glad I'm wrong.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.236
Willie.

26:13.322 --> 26:14.572
No, I know.

26:14.657 --> 26:18.701
I can make it in half an hour,
45 minutes, something like that. Sure.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.553
Where's Carmen, my girlfriend?

26:37.888 --> 26:39.931
- She just went in the bathroom.
- Bathroom?

26:40.474 --> 26:42.183
You know what this is?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.018
Balabushka.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.854
- Balabushka?
- Yeah.

26:46.981 --> 26:50.191
- Where did you get a Balabushka?
- Eddie Felson gave it to me.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.819
- Eddie Felson gave you a Balabushka?
- Yeah.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.990
It's a pretty good gift.
You know what that's worth?

26:57.074 --> 26:58.199
Yeah.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.370
That guy died about 10 or 15 years ago.
It's gotta be a collector's item by now.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.496
Yeah.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.000
It's my word against yours, right?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.210
I'm a middle-aged Jewish man.
I'm a rare book expert.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.880
- Have you seen my girlfriend, Julian?
- She went out.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.841
- Out where?
- She's your girlfriend, man.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.801
Where was I?

28:01.847 --> 28:02.847
Hey.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.351
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.686
- Where did you go?
- Went out to get cigs.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.980
They sell cigarettes right here.

28:11.065 --> 28:13.024
So I went across the street to get them.
So what?

28:13.108 --> 28:16.402
You needed some fresh air, right?

28:17.279 --> 28:19.030
What's your problem?

28:20.115 --> 28:23.076
No problem. Did I say I had a problem?
There's no problem.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.911
I'm glad to hear it.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.538
I just didn't know where you went.
I was looking for you.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.541
I'm going to sit down now. Is that okay?

28:30.626 --> 28:32.001
Yeah.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.171
I might go to the bathroom again
in about a half hour. Is that okay?

28:35.839 --> 28:38.591
- That's great, Carmen.
- I'll be sure and tell you when, okay?

28:38.967 --> 28:42.303
Hey, look, I just didn't know
where you went, all right?

28:42.388 --> 28:43.388
Come on.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.808
I was looking for you. Let's not make
a federal production out of this, okay.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.101
Okay!

28:48.811 --> 28:49.977
Okay.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.360
- It's a Balabushka. Eddie gave it to me.
- Great.

29:42.406 --> 29:46.284
Eddie, uh, I've been thinking about it.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.537
- Let's do it, okay?
- Great.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.219
- I wonder what's upstairs.
- Why?

30:05.804 --> 30:10.850
Well, there might be something soft
for you to lean against.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.937
So I don't crush your skirt.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.363
What do
they do in the Bahamas?

30:24.448 --> 30:26.115
Do they tango or rumba?

30:26.283 --> 30:27.867
Samba, I think.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.372
How's that Old McDonnell working out?

30:34.124 --> 30:36.792
- You're drinking it now.
- You serious?

30:38.086 --> 30:40.588
- Good stuff.
- It's very good stuff.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.049
Yo, Eddie. My man, hey!

30:43.675 --> 30:46.010
Why don't you look in the mirror
before you leave the john, huh?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.054
I hate that shit.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.683
Better than that shit.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.977
Hey, listen, Eddie.
You gonna be around Monday?

30:55.062 --> 30:56.354
There's a guy I got set up in Camden.

30:56.438 --> 30:59.315
No, I'm gonna be out of town
for a couple of weeks.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.734
Bullshit.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.320
What? You're taking that guy
on the road? What's his name?

31:04.404 --> 31:06.030
I don't know his name.
It's none of your business.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.615
That guy is a chump.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.701
What did he do? Beat me one night.
I put the nine ball up both your asses.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.954
Are you serious, taking him on the road?

31:13.038 --> 31:15.373
When was the last time
you did the road? 1960?

31:16.124 --> 31:18.000
They didn't even have cars then.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.211
What?

31:21.004 --> 31:24.298
Come on. You banging his girlfriend?
Right?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.384
You can tell me.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.428
Jesus, you are the best, Julian.

31:29.513 --> 31:31.138
Let me play him again tonight.

31:31.348 --> 31:34.892
- Winner gets in the car with you.
- No, you're the best, Julian.

31:35.018 --> 31:38.062
You're not the only stakehorse around,
you know that?

31:38.313 --> 31:40.273
See you in Atlantic City, okay?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.650
Don't look too hard for me, okay?

31:47.197 --> 31:50.157
Hey, we are going to the Bahamas.
I just didn't say when.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.326
I appreciate hearing about it
from that dope fiend.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.786
I didn't want to tell anybody.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.621
What if I get on the road
and the kid doesn't work out?

31:55.706 --> 31:57.248
It makes me feel great, Eddie, great.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.042
That guy sucks, man, and so do you!

32:00.210 --> 32:02.253
All right, I am wrong! Uh-huh.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.421
But let me do it my way.

32:03.505 --> 32:04.839
Do it any way you want to do it, Eddie.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.425
What I want is, I just want to go
on the road, I don't wanna tell anybody!

32:07.509 --> 32:09.552
Fine! If you got anything that
you need at my apartment,

32:09.678 --> 32:11.679
you'll find it in a suitcase
out front, okay?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.515
Hey, wait a...

32:18.687 --> 32:19.895
I'm sorry.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.693
I cover all expenses. Food, room,
everything, entry fees, everything.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.322
For that, I get 60% of everything
you win, all bets.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.158
I lay the bets,
so I also take the losses if you lose.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.285
So for that I get 60% of what you win.

32:34.369 --> 32:37.163
60%? What are you, a slumlord?

32:37.247 --> 32:39.957
Honey, you find a newcomer
with a better deal than that,

32:40.042 --> 32:41.626
you come to me, we talk.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.587
Don't worry. I'm not going to lose often.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.007
Oh, yes, you will.
That's what I'm gonna teach you.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.886
Sometimes if you lose, you win. Go.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.346
So who's the heaviest guy?

32:53.430 --> 32:56.140
What do you ask that for?
I'm the heaviest guy. Right, Eddie?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.684
Aw. It doesn't make any sense.
It goes in streaks.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.479
The balls roll funny
for everybody, kiddo.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.314
There is this guy, Grady Seasons.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.024
He's making the most money
straight up on paper, but...

33:05.108 --> 33:07.485
- Grady Seasons?
- But that doesn't mean anything.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.237
- Grady Seasons.
- The real money is in the practice room.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.657
That's where you get a good game.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.910
I mean, a guy can get wiped out
in the first day of the tournament,

33:15.994 --> 33:17.953
and hang around in the practice room
for a couple of days,

33:18.038 --> 33:19.872
and make more money than the guy
who won the tournament.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.248
Do you hear that?

33:21.416 --> 33:22.750
The practice room!

33:22.834 --> 33:24.627
Hey, watch the paint.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.128
What?

33:26.421 --> 33:27.421
Oh.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.466
- Is that metal on yourjacket?
- Sorry about that.

33:30.801 --> 33:31.801
Shit.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.151
Rubba-dub,
here comes the grub.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.489
My pancakes are burnt.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.535
What's this? No, no, wait a minute.
We ordered four on, two up.

33:57.619 --> 33:58.661
I don't want sausage.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.454
Sorry, I must've given you
the wrong order.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.124
- That's a dead giveaway.
- What is?

34:03.333 --> 34:06.419
- The four on two.
- Oh, egg talk.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.880
She was the killer waitress
at the Acropolis.

34:09.965 --> 34:13.676
Then she did them a favor and quit.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.802
Ow!

34:14.886 --> 34:17.513
What do you think?
He's the only one who has to work?

34:20.266 --> 34:22.143
How come you don't
play pool anymore?

34:22.476 --> 34:23.643
I quit.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.773
Actually, somebody retired me.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.192
Sometimes you get in with
the wrong kind of people, you know?

34:30.277 --> 34:31.819
But, hey, that was a long time ago.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.947
Back east. It's dead and buried.
I don't even think about it.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.324
I won my share of medals.

34:38.326 --> 34:41.704
Don't you ever feel
like picking it up again?

34:41.788 --> 34:43.246
I mean,
you're always around those pool halls,

34:43.331 --> 34:44.456
you know, you see these guys...

34:44.541 --> 34:48.127
I'm too old. My wheels are shot.
It's a young man's game.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.922
Besides, there's drugs now.
Kids are playing on coke, speed.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.175
I don't know.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.927
When I was younger, it was booze.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.804
Somehow it was more human.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.474
- Booze, huh?
- Booze, yeah.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.184
Wine goes back to the Bible.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.352
The Bible never said anything
about amphetamines.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.189
- You religious, Eddie?
- Me?

35:08.940 --> 35:11.233
I get high on the man upstairs.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.779
Isn't there a masters' tournament
you can play in?

35:14.863 --> 35:17.740
I mean, I've seen this on the television,
you know, them old golfers and stuff,

35:17.824 --> 35:19.992
like an old-timers' tournament?

35:20.076 --> 35:23.412
If you're too old to cut the mustard,
you can still lick the jar, right?

35:23.497 --> 35:25.790
Nobody ever asked me
for a refund, honey.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.291
Not yet.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.675
Hey, we're just talking
around things here.

35:36.760 --> 35:41.222
It ain't about pool, it ain't about sex,
it ain't about love. It's about money.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.474
I mean,
the best is the guy with the most.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.393
That's the whole show. The best is the
guy with the most in all walks of life.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.396
Are you the best liquor salesman?

35:50.190 --> 35:51.607
You betcha.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.834
Ah. What a way to get your feet wet.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.752
This place is an all-time classic.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.296
Hey, hey!

36:14.548 --> 36:16.131
Put that cue stick in the trunk.

36:16.258 --> 36:18.759
- What am I going to play with?
- Play with a house cue.

36:19.052 --> 36:22.555
You go in there with that, nobody will
come near you with a nickel.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.277
I can't believe it, I got goose bumps.

36:36.611 --> 36:37.611
I love it.

36:38.488 --> 36:42.116
You just sit and watch for a while.
I got to see this guy.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.971
I can't wait to see what's next.

37:04.848 --> 37:08.851
Good thing I didn't
bring the Balabushka.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.645
60%.!
Are we gonna divvy this up in the car?

37:11.897 --> 37:13.147
Enough!

37:30.582 --> 37:32.583
Had enough, junior?

37:36.504 --> 37:37.838
Hold on.

37:43.637 --> 37:46.305
What the hell are you doing, Vincent?
Beat him, eat him, and get out of here.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.766
I know, I know.
I can't take this guy's money.

37:49.643 --> 37:51.894
- He's got a hole in his throat.
- So what?

37:52.562 --> 37:54.772
That guy's breaking my heart, man.
Look at him.

37:55.357 --> 37:57.399
He looks like he's on his last legs.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.694
What is it so far? 60 bucks?
It's no big deal.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.821
No big deal?

38:08.036 --> 38:09.411
You want me to quit?

38:09.579 --> 38:12.456
Yeah, if you're going to
keep on dumping like this.

38:14.459 --> 38:15.459
Unless.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.294
Show me.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.464
Make it a real performance. Show me
you can dump like a professional,

38:20.548 --> 38:21.715
it'll be worth it.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.550
Like a professional.

38:29.599 --> 38:32.726
Okay, chief. I'll play you for 30.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.692
Go around and get the car.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.236
- Why? What for?
- Just bring it around front.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.946
Head it that way.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.740
Okay, but that's the wrong way, Eddie.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.575
Just do what I tell you.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.577
Yeah, right.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.334
Easy shot!
I miss this, I'm a real chump, huh?

38:58.211 --> 38:59.920
Easy. Straight in.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.258
The tough one's the four now.

39:04.718 --> 39:05.718
I don't know.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.013
Oh, my God.

39:24.571 --> 39:28.115
Don't even bother.
I just can't hit nothing! Jesus!

39:28.533 --> 39:31.702
- That's it, kid. Where's the money?
- Yeah, I know. That's it.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.457
Uh, Eddie? Eddie!

39:37.292 --> 39:39.460
Where's the money,
you dirty little prick?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.296
Hey, Eddie's got the money.
See where they went?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.131
- Where did they go?
- Hey, it looks like they left.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.300
Hey, relax. Take it easy. What are you...

39:46.676 --> 39:48.343
What the fuck's the matter
with you guys?

39:48.428 --> 39:50.012
Get your fucking hands off...

39:50.221 --> 39:51.889
Come on. I'm going to get your money!

39:51.973 --> 39:54.141
What the fuck are you doing?
Just hold it. Just relax.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.477
Take it easy, take it easy.

40:08.782 --> 40:10.908
Come on. I'm his father!

40:10.992 --> 40:13.660
- Father?
- You little bastard! What do I do?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.496
I tell you not to play, I tell you to play!

40:15.830 --> 40:18.457
Ease off! Family! Get out of here.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.334
Yo-yo.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.924
You little punk! I hope
your mother kicks the shit out of you.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.012
Okay, go, go, go!

40:37.727 --> 40:39.353
Where to? Where?

40:39.437 --> 40:40.604
Take the parkway south
down to Norwich.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.606
- All right, all right.
- You never...

40:42.690 --> 40:44.441
Damn it, you never
ease off on somebody like that.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.151
Not when there's money involved.

40:48.321 --> 40:51.990
That's the problem with mercy, kid.
It just ain't professional.

40:53.076 --> 40:54.701
Let me look at your face.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.080
You'll live.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.623
You're gonna live, right?

40:59.707 --> 41:04.002
Get out of my face, will you?
Jesus Christ.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.300
My father.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.094
Saved your ass.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.639
Carmen, what's to be learned from this?

41:16.516 --> 41:17.975
Nice guys finish last.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.561
Is that original
or did you just make that up?

41:21.062 --> 41:23.522
Vincent, you look so sexy
with that bloody lip.

41:24.566 --> 41:25.691
Shut up.

41:28.570 --> 41:29.903
You guys want me to drive?

41:30.738 --> 41:32.072
No, I'm good.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.702
- Slimy son of a bitch.
- What?

41:36.786 --> 41:38.370
That guy, the hole.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.456
I'll stick a pool cue down his throat.

41:41.541 --> 41:44.418
Go back there with a fucking cannon
and blow all their asses away!

41:44.502 --> 41:46.170
Oh, Vincent, that's gross.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.506
- Next time, kid.
- I'm sorry.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.185
One of you guys know
where the Triumph Motel is?

42:01.269 --> 42:03.020
The what? The what?

42:03.104 --> 42:05.981
- Triumph Motel.
- Yeah, yeah.

42:06.482 --> 42:09.443
Go left on Aurora and right on Seneca.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.361
Chalkie's still around?

42:11.446 --> 42:13.447
- Chalkie's?
- Yeah, it's a pool hall.

42:13.823 --> 42:16.366
I know what it is, man.
Yeah, it's still around.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.535
What?
It's supposed to move somewhere?

42:19.787 --> 42:21.288
Some things never change.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.123
Man, I wouldn't bet on it.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.213
- Eddie.
- Enter!

42:31.299 --> 42:32.633
Hey, good morning.

42:34.427 --> 42:35.427
What's happening?

42:35.762 --> 42:37.137
Come on. Let's get going, guys.

42:37.305 --> 42:38.972
I'm ordering room service.
You want anything?

42:41.851 --> 42:43.185
Food, you hungry?

42:43.853 --> 42:45.145
I hate the weather!

42:47.774 --> 42:49.441
You can't get room service in a motel.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.693
Come on, let's check out Chalkie's.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.528
Tell your girlfriend to get going.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.781
Meet you all downstairs in the lobby.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.617
What about food? I'm starved!

43:01.162 --> 43:03.163
- Vincent?
- Yeah?

43:03.790 --> 43:05.874
Don't change the shirt, it's a nice touch.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.543
- Shirt?
- And leave the cue stick.

43:08.878 --> 43:10.879
What the hell's the use of having it?

43:12.882 --> 43:15.092
This used to be a nice
average bad neighborhood.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.135
- Now look at it.
- Yeah, look at this.

43:17.679 --> 43:19.054
Is all the places going to be like this?

43:19.138 --> 43:21.932
I mean, on your pool hall scale
of one to 10, what do you rate this?

43:22.016 --> 43:24.476
-10.
- At least this one's got tables.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.104
- Hi, guys.
- How you doing?

43:30.733 --> 43:32.234
Squeeze me in?

43:33.152 --> 43:35.529
Table Number 7 for Fast Eddie.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.534
Yeah, see you don't recognize
Orvis from way back when.

43:41.536 --> 43:44.246
Son of a bitch.
What the hell are you doing here?

43:44.330 --> 43:48.250
Now you starting to remember.
How long do you want it for?

43:48.418 --> 43:49.459
A couple hours.

43:50.670 --> 43:53.130
The last time I saw you,
you were sweeping up at McGirr's.

43:53.214 --> 43:55.340
Sweeping up at McGirr's, that's right.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.843
Then I started working here for Chalkie.

43:58.219 --> 44:01.722
Till he got scared of the bad element
moving in and sold out.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.099
Since then I've been running Chalkie's.

44:04.934 --> 44:07.269
Well, what can I do for you?
Looking for some action?

44:07.520 --> 44:10.647
Usually I steer for 20%,
but for you it's 10.

44:10.732 --> 44:13.066
Not me.
It's my friend here wants a game.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.735
How you doing, Orvis?

44:20.366 --> 44:22.034
Wild place you got here.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.581
What are you doing, Eddie?
Stakehorsing?

44:29.042 --> 44:31.418
You know who you got here
stakehorsing for you?

44:32.086 --> 44:34.463
This here is Fast Eddie Felson.

44:34.547 --> 44:36.381
Who the hell are you?
The end of the world?

44:36.466 --> 44:38.800
Come on, ease it up, will you, Orvis?

44:39.635 --> 44:44.264
Him, I'll steer for 15, since he's staked
by Fast Eddie the Stakehorse.

44:45.308 --> 44:47.434
What you playing, nine-ball or straight?

45:03.326 --> 45:06.787
It's in the way that you use it

45:06.871 --> 45:08.663
- You should go back to the motel.
- Why?

45:08.748 --> 45:11.291
Why? What? Are you kidding me?
Take a look around this place.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.126
There's gotta be tons
of rape artists here. "Why?"

45:13.252 --> 45:14.878
Maybe you should go back to the motel.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.296
- Me?
- A pretty boy like you.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.798
- Cut it out.
- A cute boy like you.

45:17.882 --> 45:19.299
- I'm serious...
- You're such a cute boy.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.592
- Carmen.
- Vincent.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.220
- Not here.
- Hey. Let me give you the scoop, killer.

45:23.304 --> 45:25.847
See that guy with the tiepin
in his nose over there?

45:28.309 --> 45:29.267
Yeah.

45:29.352 --> 45:31.561
Okay, that's Moselle.
Him, we stay away from.

45:32.230 --> 45:34.564
- No shit.
- Grow up.

45:34.649 --> 45:37.567
Him, we stay away from,
'cause he's the main stick around here.

45:37.652 --> 45:40.821
You beat him, it scares away
that gentleman over there.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.614
Who's he?

45:42.907 --> 45:46.284
That's Earl. He comes in here,
he's got $5,000, $6,000 in his pocket.

45:46.494 --> 45:47.786
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.872
Runs the numbers,
Orvis says he don't mind losing,

45:50.957 --> 45:52.332
he just don't like to give it away.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.418
So you beat Moselle

45:55.211 --> 45:57.671
and old Earl over there loses interest.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.090
What happens now?

46:00.675 --> 46:03.343
Nothing for a little while.
We'll play over here.

46:05.012 --> 46:08.056
He'll be watching you
and he'll come to you.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.976
- Who am I going to play?
- Me.

46:11.561 --> 46:13.270
You? Okay.

46:13.563 --> 46:16.231
Eddie, but before we go,
I want her to go back to the motel.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.274
Oh, Christ.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.109
I'm sorry, but this place
is goddamn birdland.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.486
Look, I've been in worse places,
I've dated worse guys.

46:21.571 --> 46:23.822
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey, watch your hands.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.533
Okay, okay, okay. That's enough.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.118
- That's enough.
- You gotta tell me.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.036
- Let go, Vincent.
- Okay, that's enough.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.914
Tell Orvis to get you a cab
back to the motel.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.124
- I don't want to take a cab.
- Carmen, Carmen.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.709
Goddamn it!

46:38.337 --> 46:39.796
Jesus Christ.

46:44.260 --> 46:48.555
No thunderbolt breaks, no runs over
four balls. Just take it nice and easy.

46:50.057 --> 46:51.892
Fate stumbles in

46:52.393 --> 46:54.936
She never went out
with any guys like these.

46:55.104 --> 46:59.399
Vincent, would you pay attention?
That guy Earl is paying attention.

47:00.651 --> 47:01.735
Are you listening to me?

47:02.403 --> 47:03.820
Yeah, yeah.

47:05.406 --> 47:09.034
I needed someone

47:09.535 --> 47:11.786
Do you want me to break?
You want to break?

47:12.246 --> 47:13.747
No. I'll break.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.045
What'd they do,
saw the legs off this thing?

47:20.129 --> 47:22.130
This is a table for dwarfs or something.

47:22.256 --> 47:27.219
Come on, Fast Eddie. I want to see
some heavy legend action here.

47:27.595 --> 47:29.846
I think I see 35 balls down there.

47:30.640 --> 47:35.227
Out of left field

47:36.604 --> 47:37.896
Not bad, huh?

47:37.980 --> 47:39.189
Love came along

47:39.273 --> 47:40.899
This isn't pool. This is for bangers.

47:40.983 --> 47:44.945
Straight pool is pool. This is like
handball or cribbage or something.

47:47.448 --> 47:51.535
Straight pool, you got to
be a real surgeon to get over.

47:52.495 --> 47:54.037
It's all finesse.

47:55.498 --> 47:58.333
Now everything is nine-ball,
'cause it's fast.

47:59.126 --> 48:02.462
Good for TV.
Good for a loud break shot.

48:03.631 --> 48:06.466
Oh, well, what the hell?
Checkers sells more than chess.

48:09.804 --> 48:10.929
Pretty damn good.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.557
Not bad for a blind man. Rack them up.

48:13.641 --> 48:15.433
Yes, sir, boss.

48:16.686 --> 48:18.395
Rack them up for Mr. Fast Eddie.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.814
I haven't played serious pool
since before you were born.

48:20.940 --> 48:24.067
Right off the bat,
I'm laying them to waste.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.987
Watch this. Nine on the break.

48:29.115 --> 48:30.115
Oh!

48:30.199 --> 48:31.575
Jesus, Eddie!

48:33.160 --> 48:34.327
Damn.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.664
- All yours.
- That was phenomenal!

48:39.458 --> 48:42.502
I'd like to play that big dude Moselle.
I bet he ain't that good.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.171
Yeah?

48:47.049 --> 48:48.425
I don't know, Eddie.

48:48.968 --> 48:50.343
Maybe you're right.

48:51.345 --> 48:53.763
Maybe this game is just for bangers.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.152
Cool it.

49:07.236 --> 49:09.195
But the thing is,

49:11.574 --> 49:14.659
even if it is just for bangers,
everybody's doing it.

49:17.246 --> 49:18.580
If everybody's doing it,

49:21.083 --> 49:22.709
that's a lot of guys doing it.

49:27.173 --> 49:28.757
A lot of guys doing it,

49:38.184 --> 49:40.560
but only one guy can be the best.

49:48.027 --> 49:49.361
Eddie, hey.

49:51.072 --> 49:52.072
Hey!

49:53.741 --> 49:54.741
Eddie.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.328
Eddie!

49:58.579 --> 50:00.038
Eddie, what?

50:00.164 --> 50:04.834
Where you going? All right, hey,
those were easy shots, man.

50:05.378 --> 50:07.504
Come on, all right, okay.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.840
I'm sorry. I'm a smartass,
I was showing off. I'm sorry, all right?

50:10.925 --> 50:12.592
- You know what this is turning into?
- What?

50:12.677 --> 50:15.053
A waste of my time
and a waste of my money.

50:19.809 --> 50:22.435
Where are you going, huh?
Eddie! What?

50:22.603 --> 50:24.938
You're gonna leave me here? What?

50:26.732 --> 50:28.775
I don't believe this guy!

50:42.331 --> 50:43.623
Child care.

50:45.626 --> 50:46.626
Eddie.

50:59.473 --> 51:00.557
Vincent back?

51:00.891 --> 51:02.976
- Yeah, but he's out.
- What do you mean, out?

51:03.686 --> 51:05.061
Out, like not in the room.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.981
- Mind getting dressed?
- Why, are we going somewhere?

51:10.443 --> 51:12.360
Guy comes into the room.
What if I was somebody else?

51:12.445 --> 51:13.445
Like who?

51:13.654 --> 51:16.489
- That's not the point.
- Look, I'm not naked or anything.

51:17.450 --> 51:19.868
And another thing,
work with me, not against me.

51:19.952 --> 51:21.953
Don't go saying to Vincent
what you said to him at Chalkie's.

51:22.121 --> 51:23.329
Gets him all upset.

51:24.331 --> 51:26.207
If you're going to use that thing,
use it right.

51:27.835 --> 51:29.294
Use what thing?

51:35.384 --> 51:36.801
- C'mon.
- What are doing?

51:36.886 --> 51:38.511
- Me and you!
- Let me go.

51:38.596 --> 51:40.597
- I like it in the shower.
- No!

51:40.681 --> 51:42.599
A quick one before Vincent
gets back, all right?

51:42.683 --> 51:43.683
Hey.

51:45.311 --> 51:46.770
I'm not your daddy,
I'm not your boyfriend,

51:46.854 --> 51:49.189
so don't be playing games with me.
I'm your partner.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.566
You don't flirt with me,
you don't come on with me.

51:51.859 --> 51:53.485
If you take a shower,
you shut the goddamn door!

51:53.569 --> 51:54.986
Don't flatter yourself.

51:55.362 --> 51:57.822
Don't waste my time
with bullshit, Carmen.

52:10.211 --> 52:13.087
We got a racehorse here.
A thoroughbred.

52:13.422 --> 52:15.715
You make him feel good.
I teach him how to run.

52:16.509 --> 52:18.885
Do you understand me?
We're business people.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.807
Gotcha.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.773
Where's the Balabushka?

52:32.900 --> 52:35.276
- Vincent took it.
- I thought you said he was out.

52:35.861 --> 52:37.320
Yeah, he was in, he was out.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.739
- He took the cue stick?
- Yes.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.951
- And you let him?
- So what?

52:46.497 --> 52:47.747
Shit.

52:50.584 --> 52:53.878
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus goddamn!

52:54.421 --> 52:55.755
Child care.

53:15.526 --> 53:16.609
Shit.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.156
Good game. Good game.

53:26.287 --> 53:27.745
What you got in there?

53:28.998 --> 53:30.290
In here?

53:37.298 --> 53:38.423
Doom.

53:43.137 --> 53:46.222
- Come on, boy, let's play.
- Yeah, let's play.

53:46.891 --> 53:48.141
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.271
Werewolves of London

54:16.545 --> 54:20.590
He's the hairy-handed gent
Who ran amuck in Kent

54:21.175 --> 54:24.385
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair

54:26.055 --> 54:30.183
You better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim

54:31.310 --> 54:33.478
I'd like to meet his tailor

54:36.982 --> 54:39.192
Werewolves of London

54:46.617 --> 54:48.368
Werewolves of London

54:54.667 --> 54:57.627
Well, I saw Lon Chaney
Walking with the Queen

55:03.550 --> 55:06.427
I saw Lon Chaney Jr.
Walking with the Queen

55:08.180 --> 55:10.848
Doing the Werewolves of London

55:12.476 --> 55:15.645
I saw a werewolf drinking
A pina colada at Trader Vic's

55:17.898 --> 55:19.649
His hair was perfect

55:27.366 --> 55:29.575
Werewolves of London

55:34.415 --> 55:35.540
Ow!

55:54.435 --> 55:56.686
Not bad, my man. Not bad.

55:56.770 --> 55:59.397
- When you leaving town? Now, right?
- You don't want to play me again?

55:59.481 --> 56:02.442
Moselle, I'm joking.
Don't kill me, all right?

56:10.826 --> 56:12.285
That boy's hot.

56:19.585 --> 56:21.169
Did you see me tonight?

56:22.254 --> 56:23.254
Hey!

56:23.797 --> 56:26.632
What? I made money.

56:27.134 --> 56:30.428
You lost money.
The town is dead for you.

56:31.013 --> 56:34.807
What the hell is it? Do I not speak your
native language? What is the matter?

56:34.975 --> 56:37.727
You give me this stick, okay,
and then you tell me to lay low.

56:37.811 --> 56:40.563
I mean, the goddamn thing, I lay it
down, it just jumps up at me, man.

56:40.647 --> 56:42.607
You don't deserve this stick.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.485
I don't deserve this?

56:47.446 --> 56:49.489
You don't deserve this stick.

56:49.615 --> 56:52.825
All you do is you sit in there and
you talk, you know, you tell me things.

56:53.327 --> 56:55.203
Did you see me there tonight? I played.

56:55.329 --> 56:57.497
I'm a fucking pool player, Eddie.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.460
Know something? I'm a fucking animal!

57:04.755 --> 57:05.755
Animal.

57:11.011 --> 57:13.096
Vincent, get in the car.
This is embarrassing.

57:13.180 --> 57:16.182
You're acting like some girl
who got felt up in a drive-in.

57:18.393 --> 57:21.604
- This looks terrible. Get in, will you?
- Tough shit!

57:22.898 --> 57:25.650
How much did you take off of Moselle?
I heard 100.

57:25.984 --> 57:26.984
One fifty.

57:27.611 --> 57:30.279
- Hundred and fifty.
- Yeah, 150.

57:30.739 --> 57:32.532
You walk into a shoe store
with 150 bucks

57:32.616 --> 57:34.492
and you come out with one shoe!

57:36.120 --> 57:38.246
We were working on 5,000.

57:39.540 --> 57:42.375
Come on. Get in, it's cold.

57:47.089 --> 57:48.464
Vincent.

57:52.678 --> 57:56.472
Well, I gotta hand it to you, kid.
You got me talking to myself.

57:57.224 --> 58:00.143
I got half of me that says I got a hold
of the best thing that I ever seen

58:00.227 --> 58:02.395
and half of me that says
it just ain't worth it.

58:04.398 --> 58:06.274
I mean, either I don't teach you right,

58:06.859 --> 58:10.236
or you don't listen.
Or you listen, but you don't hear.

58:12.114 --> 58:15.783
What was that voodoo stuff back there?
That wasn't pool. That was a circus!

58:15.909 --> 58:17.410
You dropped your pants.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.580
You want to get known? Good.
You and Gypsy Rose Lee.

58:24.126 --> 58:25.918
I can always go back to whiskey.

58:26.086 --> 58:27.420
It's been very good to me.

58:27.671 --> 58:32.175
I mean, you're sitting in it
and I'm wearing it.

58:32.259 --> 58:36.220
But it's tired.
You know, it's just kind of run out.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.515
All of a sudden you appear on
the scene, and I'm jumping again.

58:40.350 --> 58:47.231
You remind me that money won
is twice as sweet as money earned.

58:48.817 --> 58:51.068
Twenty-five years ago,
I had the screws put on me.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.696
I mean, it was over for me

58:54.281 --> 58:56.157
before it really got started.

58:57.451 --> 59:00.870
But I'm hungry again
and you bled that back into me.

59:01.788 --> 59:04.123
You gotta have two things to win.

59:05.125 --> 59:08.419
You gotta have brains
and you gotta have balls.

59:08.879 --> 59:11.130
Now, you got too much of one
and not enough of the other.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.095
All right.

59:18.805 --> 59:22.975
I don't know. Tell me what you
want to do. Give me a clue.

59:27.481 --> 59:28.481
Uh...

59:35.697 --> 59:40.243
I'll try, I'll really try.
You know, let's go for it.

59:42.663 --> 59:44.705
You know, Eddie, I mean,

59:45.874 --> 59:49.126
it's just tough for me to lay down.
You know, it's just...

59:49.836 --> 59:52.713
I get in there and it's just tough.
It's just...

59:54.508 --> 59:56.425
It's just tough to lay down.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.178
But I'll try, okay?

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.347
Tough to lay down?

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:05.518
Well, roll over, sweetheart. Give me.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.355
- What?
- Ninety bucks.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.024
60%. of 150 is 90 bucks.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.868
Did I wake you up?

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.746
Well, do you want to hang up?

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.875
Are you still pissed off at me?

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:35.214
Well, if you were, I'd understand.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:43.723
I don't know. I'm having nightmares,
sweats and everything.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.808
What kind of rent are you paying?

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:48.394
I said, what kind of rent do you pay?

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:52.982
Well, listen.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.027
After the Bahamas,

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.905
maybe you could move in with me.

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:01.699
Just for practice.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:07.330
What do you mean? No, nothing's
going on. What are you, a shrink?

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:09.957
I miss you. I say nice things to you.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:13.836
Fine.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.757
A couple of curve balls
every now and then.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.427
They're young. They're kids.
No, no. You're perfect.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:29.602
I love this. Hey, Carmen, you should
have seen Eddie play last night.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.145
Are we going to
make some money today,

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.481
or am I still talking
to Our Lady of the Cue Balls?

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.649
We'll make some money. Definitely.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:37.360
I'm a wild man today.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:40.488
Did you ever hear of a hustle
called "two brothers and a stranger"?

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.741
Uh, yeah. That's the guy in the Bible
with the many-colored coats, right?

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:47.328
Jesus, Vincent.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.873
Hey, I'm joking, you guys.
Come on. I'm just...

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.792
Did I get through to you last night, kid?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.628
'Cause if I didn't,
I'll run it by you another way.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.255
If you'd have kicked ass
in any other place but Chalkie's,

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.383
Atlantic City would be dead for us.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.843
The guys never leave the street.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:05.346
Otherwise, it would be all around.

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.058
Hey, let me tell you something.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:13.312
Last night, you know, people never
talked to me like that before.

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.065
You really talked to me.

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:19.235
And I just want you to know
that I appreciate it.

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:21.070
- And...
- Okay.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.989
I want to thank you,
you know, for everything.

01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:38.045
Don't worry, kid. Don't worry.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:46.595
Two brothers and a stranger. Okay?

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.265
You got two guys
that go into a bar, see?

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.856
Give me two hours, they'll be
building me a trophy wall in there, huh?

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.653
Look at that kid.
He gets to have all the fun.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.323
Lock and load.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:17.168
All right. Who's next here? You guys,
you want to play? No? Anybody.

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:19.545
You want to play?
What about you? You want to play?

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.423
- Forget it.
- Spot you the break here.

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:26.427
Come on, I'll spot you the break.
How about it?

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:28.554
- I want the seven ball, too.
- Seven.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.389
How about the eight?
I'll give you the eight.

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:34.310
Come on. The eight, the break.
What do you want? All right? You up?

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:35.644
Let's go.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.589
Why don't you keep it down, huh?

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.260
What did I say? I coughed.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:21.357
- Well.
- Stop it, Eddie.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.319
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me?

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.239
I said, do you mind? I mean,
it's a money game here, guy. Okay?

01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:44.880
- Big money game.
- Yeah, that's right. A big money game.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:48.092
So why don't you take your hands
off the girl and let us play, okay, guy?

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.094
What do you care where I put my hand?

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.428
Why don't you
mind your own business?

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:52.513
Hey, Gramps.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:54.765
Put your teeth back in,
get your hands off your daughter there

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:57.059
and pay attention. You just
might learn something here today.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.645
I'll change my teeth,
you change your goddamn diapers.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.647
Hey, we've got a game going here.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.984
Really? What are you playing for?

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.612
- What's it to you?
- What are you playing for?

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.283
- Fifty.
- You want to win?

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.830
I'll bet 500 bucks on this guy right here.

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.623
Huh?

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.875
I think you're a choker, kiddo.

01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:23.877
Five hundred bucks says
you choke right now.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.421
Why don't you take a walk, asshole?

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.381
Anybody want to
bet 500 bucks the kid chokes?

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:28.924
- Eddie, cut it out.
- What are you starting trouble for?

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:30.259
I'm not starting any trouble.

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:31.885
- You're starting trouble.
- Come on. Any takers?

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.721
- Eddie, I'm gonna leave.
- Any takers?

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:35.848
- This guy's a jerk.
- Want to go for 1,000?

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.525
I know. I mean, you'd think
he would have seen it before.

01:05:46.985 --> 01:05:48.611
- How are you?
- Pretty good.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:52.031
Oh, my God,
he got suckered into that so good.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.366
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.369
- Hey.
- What's up? What do you think?

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:59.663
- Get in the car.
- Hey.

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:00.789
Get away from me.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.791
Hey, Vincent!
What the hell is the matter with you?

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:04.001
Did you have a good time, huh, Eddie?

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.211
I'm a little disappointed in you, frankly.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:09.590
Frankly, huh? Well, frankly, your ass!
I seen you, man.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.008
- Seen what?
- Don't give me that. I seen you!

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.301
Seen what?

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:16.138
Screw this. You know what I mean?
I don't need this. I'm gone.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.891
I'm going home. Come on, Carmen.
We're going home.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.517
- The hell you are.
- The hell I am?

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:21.602
You're going home alone, man.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.854
Is that right?
Now I'm going home alone.

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.272
Yeah, what? Is it you and Eddie now?

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.483
Are you gonna go to bars
and get felt up by Eddie? Is that it?

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.193
- Vincent, Vincent.
- Come on!

01:06:29.361 --> 01:06:31.820
You go in that place, you play your part.
It's nice, huh?

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.198
I put my hands on her,
I'm playing a part. It's acting.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:37.743
- Your hands were all over her, Eddie!
- I'm acting! It's acting!

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.499
Hey, look, Vincent,
when you go into movies

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:47.503
and you see people kissing, what do
you think, they go home together?

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:51.256
- They're professionals, Vincent.
- We're just trying to be professionals.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.479
Okay, you guys.
It was just a little rough. Okay?

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.564
I mean, you know,
I ain't used to that, Carmen.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:09.400
Vincent. Vincent.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.026
- I don't know about this.
- Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:13.237
Vincent the Kid, huh?

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:15.823
You are gonna be
one of the greats, kiddo.

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:18.534
One of the greats.
I got a good feeling about this.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:19.618
Yeah?

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:29.420
You say it's black
But you know it's white

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:33.132
You say it's day
When you know it's night

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:36.218
You'll say it's good
When you know it's mean

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.847
It's the finest music
That I ever seen

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:45.602
Don't you tell me nothin'

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:50.733
So don't you tell me nothin'
I can see

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:54.111
Rock and rollin'
is good for me

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.587
You say it's a dog
When you know it's two cats

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.840
You say it's a mouse
When you know it's a rat

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:18.343
You say it's meat
When you know it's bread

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:21.721
You tell me it's gold
And it's a hunk of lead

01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.015
Don't you tell me nothin'

01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:27.770
Well, don't you tell me nothin'

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.316
Don't ya tell me nothin'
I can see

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.861
Rock and rollin'
is good for me

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.992
Don't you tell me nothin'

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.636
You say it's right
And you know it's wrong

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:03.930
You say it's short
And you know it's long

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:07.350
You say it's low
When you know it's high

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.854
Tell me the truth
And don't tell no lie

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:13.564
Don't tell me nothin'

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.234
Don't you tell me nothin'

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.156
Don't tell me nothin'
I can see

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:23.908
Rock and rollin'
is good for me

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.078
This is too much. No, really. I can't.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.622
Are you sure you don't
want to play again? I mean...

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.261
Hmm.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.430
Do you smell what I smell?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.432
Smoke?

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.225
Money.

01:09:50.562 --> 01:09:52.854
Let's take a stroll around.
See what's what.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:10:01.947
A starless black sky will be
somewhere in America

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.470
Hey.

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.433
Check out that guy
that's playing back there.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.185
- That guy?
- Yeah.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:35.814
This is a golden opportunity.
You know who that is?

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:39.026
That's Grady Seasons.
He's the best money player in the world.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.569
That's Grady Seasons?

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:44.323
You want me to play him?

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:45.657
You bet.

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:50.120
And you are gonna dump.
You are gonna lose something fierce.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:53.248
You're gonna ask for a spot and you're
gonna ask for the break. Everything.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.250
It's gonna be humiliating.
This is beautiful.

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.836
- What do you mean, dump?
- What do I mean, dump?

01:10:57.962 --> 01:11:00.088
Because if you lose bad now to this guy,

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.549
you'll be a super nobody
in Atlantic City,

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:04.259
and the odds on you
will drop to nothing.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:07.054
- Right?
- See? She learns.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.430
Let me ask you something.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.223
I mean, I seen these guys,
they hustle and they win.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:11.767
How come I always got to play the jerk?

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.353
I mean, why can't
we have a hustle where I win?

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:17.898
Because this is better than that.
There's something at the end of this.

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:22.110
I wouldn't even tell you to do it
unless the payoff was phenomenal.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:28.867
Look, do whatever you want to do.
Do it your way. Whatever you want.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.245
I'm gonna play.
I ask this guy a question,

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.830
he gets his panties in a bunch.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.397
It's like a nightmare, isn't it?

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:08.365
It just keeps getting worse and worse,
doesn't it?

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:17.249
Are you gonna fall for this?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:22.629
We're gonna pay hell for it

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:26.508
Now we can't wait for it

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:27.634
Oh-ho-ho.

01:12:27.719 --> 01:12:29.219
The impossible dream.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:32.180
We let ourselves in for it

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.060
Wild calculations

01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:41.898
Exert a fascination

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.945
Tame speculation

01:12:49.157 --> 01:12:52.659
We let ourselves in for it

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.373
Don't choke now.
It's not that hard a shot.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:05.297
- Did you just say, "Don't choke now"?
- Yeah. You heard me.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.467
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you.

01:13:09.135 --> 01:13:11.762
We let ourselves in for it

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.976
We were bound
to make the most of it

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.437
Here's the best of it

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.981
Let yourself in

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:27.486
Any way that
you figure it

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.280
Got it at our fingertips

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.282
Got to give in

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:47.339
Hey, Grady. Up your ass with the spot.
Okay with you?

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:48.840
That's fine with me.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.218
How you doing?

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.971
Carmen, I'm playing here.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.473
Yeah, I know. I know. Listen.

01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:24.895
You win one more game, you're gonna
be humping your fist for a long time.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:26.605
Okay, Vincent?

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:28.773
Got that?

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.456
What are you doing, meditating?

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:14.736
Yeah?

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.912
Yeah? Hey.

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:28.959
- Can I have the Balabushka?
- Yeah.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.964
- Are you gonna play, Eddie?
- Yeah, maybe.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.674
Where?

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.968
- I don't know. Gunther's.
- Gunther's?

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:39.261
Want me to go with you?

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:40.971
- No, that's okay.
- You're not mad at me, are you?

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.640
- About last night?
- No, you done good.

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:49.354
- Where's he going?
- He's going to Gunther's, ja.

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:20.927
Hey, Bill.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:24.180
Why don't you call Dud?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:37.235
Thank you.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.739
Bill, I'll have another Drambuie
and potato salad.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.867
And while you're at it, give my friend
Eddie here another J.T.S. Brown.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.578
- One more time?
- Absolutely.

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:52.000
You know, you remind me a lot
of a guy I played about 20 years ago.

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:56.421
Matter of fact, it was right after that,
that five of us went on a road trip

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:57.672
to San Antonio.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.508
We didn't get any action.
The windup was

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.428
all five of us ended up
playing each other.

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.473
That's all she wrote.

01:18:07.058 --> 01:18:09.225
- Nice book, though.
- Buy you one?

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.687
No, I'll buy you one.
I'm gonna play for a while.

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:15.357
It's crazy, man. I mean,

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:19.194
I was working at this job, busting
my butt for about a year and a half.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:21.154
They didn't give me a raise.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.698
So my old lady, she leaves me,
'cause she says I'm a bum,

01:18:23.783 --> 01:18:24.908
'cause I quit.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:32.374
Then after, I get this job working at the
university strictly for the experience.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.460
- Guess what it was.
- What?

01:18:36.087 --> 01:18:38.046
- What?
- Well, what were you?

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.590
- I was a subject.
- A what?

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:43.301
A subject in the psych department.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.762
I was a subject for experiments.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:50.475
Reflexes, memory things.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:53.937
Except I didn't do anything
where I got that electric shock.

01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:58.316
Well, I did this once, but I just did that
for the experience, so it don't count.

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:02.404
- Shit.
- Thank you.

01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:12.539
Okay. That's 80.

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:16.292
- Do it again?
- Yeah, sure, I don't care.

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:17.919
- Double or nothing?
- Double or nothing?

01:19:18.838 --> 01:19:20.255
What is there, an echo in here?

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:24.050
Let's just do it, all right? Let's play.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.098
Eddie, how you doing?

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:33.852
- Holding my own and a little bit of his.
- Good man.

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:36.688
Here!

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:39.607
Go! Go!

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:43.736
Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:44.904
Fall!

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.158
Is that it?

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:51.786
Do it again.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.538
Double or nothing?

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:55.123
What else?

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:56.958
All right.

01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:07.927
That is bullshit. I never did that!

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.222
That is luck, man!

01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:14.559
I'm really sorry.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.437
There's nothing I can do.
The nine ball fell.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.356
I can't believe that.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:22.984
You a hustler, Amos?

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:27.405
Come on, Eddie, man. Luck.

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:30.742
Are you a hustler?

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.788
Hey, you don't want to pay me?

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.249
Keep it. Forget it.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:40.668
I don't want no bad feelings.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:42.754
I mean, a guy loses.

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:45.757
I lost, I paid. I don't...

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.969
You a hustler, Amos?

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.936
What? You want to quit?

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:02.649
Fuck you, kid.

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.276
Double it again.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.530
Hey, I want to ask you something.
I want you to be real honest with me.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.953
You think I need to lose some weight?

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:30.903
How could I get suckered like that?

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.286
You've got to work hard.
I mean, that takes a real gift

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.497
to show your ass like that.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:48.546
Everything, I got a stack.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:52.342
Everything just right,
a little too much booze.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:54.844
A little too cocky.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:57.388
Right amount ofjerk.

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:03.519
You missed all those fucking signals!

01:23:17.618 --> 01:23:19.619
You'll get him next time.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.596
How much would you need
to go it on your own?

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:40.723
From here to Atlantic City?

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:42.934
Why?

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.979
Should have wiped the floor
with that guy.

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:48.314
Yeah, so?

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:51.734
How much would you need to
go from here to Atlantic City?

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:52.985
A couple thousand?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.031
Come on, Eddie,
you've had a little too much to drink.

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:58.950
Let's go back to the motel
and forget about it.

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:02.453
I got nothing left to teach you, kid.
That was the last lesson in here.

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:07.375
Come on, take the money.
Front for yourself. You'll do fine.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.503
What are you talking, man?
Are you walking off?

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:11.921
You're dumping us?

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:13.881
Dumping you? I'm giving you a stake.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.635
I showed you all I got.
I showed you my ass in here!

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.387
And what the hell else do you want?

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:20.805
That's it, that's all.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:26.018
What are we supposed to do?

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:27.895
Where are we supposed to
go from here?

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.856
Well, here is you, see?

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.567
Here is Atlantic City.
In between is about 27 pool halls.

01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:33.901
Three weeks,
a couple thousand dollars.

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:36.320
What the hell else do you need,
an Indian guide? Use your brains!

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:37.655
Why are you talking to us
this way, huh?

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.490
Some guy comes in here
and plays you for a chump,

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.242
so you walk out on us?

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.953
I mean, come on,
we'll get this guy next time, Eddie.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:47.832
Hey, hey.

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:51.919
You do this to some guy on the street,

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:53.087
you don't do this to me.

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:56.632
What about all the stuff you told me,
we talked about, me and you, huh?

01:24:56.717 --> 01:24:58.676
- You're going to ruin everything here!
- Get out of here!

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:01.679
Carmen and me.
What you told me about that?

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:05.141
Okay, look, Eddie.
It's my attitude, right?

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.810
- Okay, from now on...
- Attitude, bullshit!

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.354
Kiddo, you always do
what you want to do.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.440
- Don't tell me that.
- If I say you do this, you do that.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.275
- Don't tell me that. I try to do everything.
- I'm tired!

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.277
I try to do everything
that you tell me to do!

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:18.821
You don't need me anymore.
Take the money.

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:22.200
- It's the last thing I got left to give you.
- Let it go, Vincent!

01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:25.286
You want to give me money
and get rid of me.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.288
You're young, kid.
You've got a long way to go.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:28.414
You wanna give me money?
Then give me money.

01:25:28.499 --> 01:25:30.249
'Cause this is nickel and dime shit
you've been giving me...

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.001
I'll give you money,
but don't you tell me what I'm about.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:34.712
- Just shut up and give me the money.
- Make it $3,000. It's our money.

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.881
- Yeah, it's my fucking money anyway!
- I'll give you what I've got.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.216
I'll give you what I got!

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.761
You know something?
Just keep your fucking money, pal.

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:46.307
Fuck it!

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.186
Fuck!

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:58.694
Here.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.615
Yeah, well...

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:17.440
Feel good, don't it?

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:21.110
- I'm blind.
- You're cool.

01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:40.004
Better? Same? Worse?
- Better.

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:45.468
- Better? Same? Worse?
- Better.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.513
Better? Same? Worse?

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.570
- I like the glasses.
- Yeah?

01:28:47.698 --> 01:28:50.741
Fast Eddie, this here's Moselle.
He plays pool.

01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:54.787
- No kidding.
- That's a nice stick.

01:28:55.038 --> 01:28:58.332
I get the break. What's the book?

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:03.129
Fifty on Fast Eddie wins you 100.
Fifty on Moselle wins you 25.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.422
Well, thanks.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:06.257
Facts of life, man.

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:09.552
- A hundred on the side?
- Read my mind.

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.262
Rack them up.

01:31:24.855 --> 01:31:27.022
You guys going to Atlantic City?

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.507
...on the
boardwalk in Atlantic City

01:31:53.592 --> 01:31:56.051
welcomes you to our casino.

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:58.554
As anyone can tell you,

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:02.183
the greatest single secret to success
on the casino floor

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:04.018
is knowing how to play the game.

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:07.479
There are slot machines,
roulette, blackjack,

01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:10.524
craps, big six and baccarat tables.

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:24.121
The rules, regulations
and pay-out odds

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:26.207
are established and supervised

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:28.542
by the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission.

01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:47.269
Knock 'em dead.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:49.480
Gonna try.

01:33:57.257 --> 01:33:58.882
Hey, Eddie.

01:34:01.219 --> 01:34:04.388
- What?
- You playing?

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:07.266
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- I don't got any problem with that.

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.643
- You got any problem with that?
- I ain't got no problems.

01:34:10.061 --> 01:34:11.562
If it makes you happy, do it.

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:16.317
Just wanted to say hello.

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:25.743
Hello. Test, test.
One, two, three, one, test.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:37.421
Ladies and gentlemen, it's nice to
see so many faces here

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:40.841
for today's 9-ball Classic.

01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:47.639
Players, start your matches.

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:00.736
I didn't deserve that.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.284
Is this your first tournament, Duke?

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:21.131
Match to Mr. Felson.
Eleven games to five.

01:35:25.261 --> 01:35:27.304
I didn't deserve that.

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.848
Yes, you did.

01:35:41.528 --> 01:35:45.280
Tall and tan
and young and handsome

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:48.992
The boy from Ipanema goes walking

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:52.663
And when he passes,
Each girl he passes

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:56.291
Goes, "Ah"

01:35:57.377 --> 01:35:58.544
We'll play 10 games.

01:35:58.628 --> 01:36:00.712
You only have to win eight,
I gotta win 10.

01:36:00.797 --> 01:36:03.924
And I'll put up $1,200
and you only have to put up $800.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:04.967
Okay, wait a minute.

01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:06.468
I only have to win eight games
to your 10?

01:36:06.553 --> 01:36:07.553
That's right.

01:36:07.637 --> 01:36:09.096
And you're gonna put up $1,200
to my $800?

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.180
That's right.

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:11.390
Carmen, that sounds like a good deal.

01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:12.891
- It is a good deal, isn't it?
- It is a good deal.

01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:15.769
This guy won the Akron Open, Vincent.
Don't be a jerk.

01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:17.271
There is no such thing
as the Akron Open.

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:18.313
Where did you hear that?

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:20.107
No? What have I been reading about?

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:21.859
Hey, Carmen.
I can win eight games here.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.110
Don't blow this. Let me play this guy...

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:24.736
No, I know you can,
I'm not gonna blow it.

01:36:24.821 --> 01:36:26.822
- I just don't like the deal.
- What don't you like about it, lady?

01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:28.407
I think maybe you should
up your end to about 1,500.

01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:29.616
- Up my end?
- That's right.

01:36:29.701 --> 01:36:32.995
$300, Vincent.
It's not gonna kill the guy, 1,500.

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:39.001
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what, I shouldn't, but I will.

01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.669
$1,500, how's that?

01:36:40.753 --> 01:36:42.212
- Is that a deal?
- Okay, yeah.

01:36:42.547 --> 01:36:46.425
- Sorry about...
- Don't be sorry, it's all right. It's 8:30.

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:48.844
I got a few things to do.
How about 12:30 in the green room?

01:36:48.928 --> 01:36:51.054
-12:30. Great.
- Terrific.

01:36:53.475 --> 01:36:55.726
- You can get these, right?
- No problem.

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:57.102
We got it covered.

01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:03.484
- $1,500?
- Not bad, huh.

01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:05.986
- Not bad, huh?
- He wouldn't go for more.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:09.198
You wouldn't go for more. That guy
had $2,000 written all over his face.

01:37:09.282 --> 01:37:12.117
You just gave him $500,
and you're gonna buy his drink, too?

01:37:12.202 --> 01:37:14.495
- Thank you!
- Why don't you do it yourself next time?

01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:15.579
Hey!

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:25.589
I gotta go rest.

01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:29.968
Hey!

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:35.390
Got new glasses, huh? They look good.

01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:37.100
Well, it's Vincent the Kid and Carmen.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:39.228
Hey, Eddie.
You looked real good today.

01:37:39.312 --> 01:37:42.105
- So how's it going?
- Can't complain. How about you?

01:37:42.315 --> 01:37:43.982
$4,000 in three weeks.

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:45.734
I guess it could have been better,
could have been worse.

01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:48.237
All right. I'm happy for you.

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.989
At 12:30 in the green room, we're
gonna take out that lame from Akron.

01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:52.991
Did you see what we did to that guy?

01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:57.120
- You want in on it?
- Well, thanks.

01:37:58.164 --> 01:38:01.041
Listen, I'll pass up on that.
I gotta play at 10:00.

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:04.086
- I'm just packing it in early.
- All right. It's on you.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:07.214
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Same to you.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:08.632
Thank you.

01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:11.426
I gotta go rest.

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.222
Come and get me
in about three hours, okay?

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:17.432
- In three?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:23.814
- Going good?
- Yeah, we're doing okay.

01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:27.985
You were right, you know,
we really didn't need you anymore.

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:29.778
That's what I said.

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:32.864
You wouldn't believe Vincent now.
You wouldn't even recognize him.

01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:34.658
A new man, huh?

01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:37.661
Why didn't you take him up on tonight?

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:40.581
Well, like I said,
I gotta get up early and play, so...

01:38:44.252 --> 01:38:46.336
All right. See you around.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:46.188
It's like a nightmare, isn't it?

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:49.524
You got lucky, you lucky prick.

01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:13.924
Wipe your nose, will you, Julian.

01:40:14.092 --> 01:40:15.759
You're going down, Eddie.

01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:29.731
Oh, goddamn. Jesus Christ!

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:32.442
Yeah, and it just keeps getting worse
and worse, doesn't it?

01:40:32.819 --> 01:40:34.736
Take it on off. I can't help it.

01:40:40.451 --> 01:40:41.451
Eddie?

01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:44.413
- Nice game, Eddie.
- Thank you.

01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:47.124
- Eddie, nice game.
- Good game.

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:58.218
I'm doing fine, yeah.

01:40:58.594 --> 01:41:00.762
I'm only feeling nervous,
because I feel good.

01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:04.975
Yeah, eyes feel good, legs feel great.

01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:09.646
I got no grief down here. Come on
down here and give me some grief.

01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:14.067
Forget the Bahamas, this is it, okay?

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:17.529
It would be good having you here.

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:05.243
Hey!

01:42:07.455 --> 01:42:09.790
I'm going to beat him, you know.

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:15.587
Maybe.

01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:21.218
Hello, Eddie.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.239
That's nice.

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:54.584
...Brian Albrecht and
Larry Schwartz.

01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:03.343
The final match on Table Number 8,
Vincent Lauria and Eddie Felson.

01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:24.961
Hey, you shot a great game.

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:32.052
Well, the balls roll funny for everybody,
I told you that.

01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:34.012
I mean, you shot a great game.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:19.974
- Come on.
- Eddie!

01:47:23.062 --> 01:47:25.063
- Who is it?
- Vincent.

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:38.118
- Hi, guys.
- I'm sorry. Should we come back later?

01:47:38.202 --> 01:47:43.748
No, we were just... Janelle's having
a glass of early bubbly. Come on in.

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:50.505
Listen, I drew this guy Kennedy,
uh, in the semi-finals.

01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:52.507
You know anything about him?

01:47:55.678 --> 01:47:57.595
- What's that?
- It's for you.

01:47:58.013 --> 01:48:00.223
Hey, how you doing? It's your cut.

01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:02.267
- Cut of what?
- For the game.

01:48:02.893 --> 01:48:04.936
- What game?
- Our game, man, I dumped.

01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:07.730
I got a front to lay off $4,000 on you,
and then I dumped.

01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:10.316
All I had to do was dog about four shots,
you know?

01:48:10.943 --> 01:48:13.611
But, Eddie, you know something,
you are a very, very good player.

01:48:14.613 --> 01:48:17.657
I feel shitty about getting booted,
but there are other tournaments, right?

01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:18.741
Right.

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.411
You dumped, huh?

01:48:21.495 --> 01:48:23.913
Carmen didn't wanna go for it,
but I told her, hey, you'd appreciate it.

01:48:23.998 --> 01:48:26.583
I mean, of all people,
there's $8,000 in there.

01:48:27.626 --> 01:48:30.461
After I beat Grady Seasons, the odds
between me and him were a joke.

01:48:31.046 --> 01:48:33.673
Two brothers and a stranger, Eddie,
just like you laid it out, you know.

01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:37.010
It was beautiful, it was just...
It was fucking beautiful.

01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:38.678
When I banked the five...

01:48:38.762 --> 01:48:41.222
When I saw the lay of the table,
I knew that it was gonna be the five.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:44.225
That's the art of the dump, right?
To be able to just

01:48:45.186 --> 01:48:47.020
miss the pocket by a hair.

01:48:47.104 --> 01:48:49.564
I mean, the audience, "Oh!" It was...

01:48:49.648 --> 01:48:51.191
It was... I...

01:48:51.734 --> 01:48:53.318
$8,000 in there.

01:48:56.697 --> 01:48:58.198
We gotta split.

01:48:58.282 --> 01:49:00.575
Look, I've got green room games
for the next three nights.

01:49:00.659 --> 01:49:02.577
These guys,
they just won't leave me alone.

01:49:02.661 --> 01:49:05.288
Are you sure you don't want in on this?
We're talking about a lot of money.

01:49:05.998 --> 01:49:07.457
Yeah, maybe.

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:09.626
Okay.

01:49:10.169 --> 01:49:14.172
I'll call you, okay?
Good luck with Kennedy, all right?

01:49:19.762 --> 01:49:21.304
He's a little prick.

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:27.018
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's good to see you all here today

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:31.189
for the semi-finals
of today's 9-ball Classic.

01:49:31.315 --> 01:49:35.944
The matches on Table 1 will
be between, from Chicago,

01:49:36.028 --> 01:49:40.448
Larry Schwartz. Larry will be playing,
from Saint Louis, Missouri,

01:49:40.658 --> 01:49:44.827
the incomparable Saint Louis Louie,
Louie Roberts.

01:49:49.959 --> 01:49:55.338
On Table 2, this year's eastern states
regional nine-ball champion

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.049
Lorenzo Kennedy will be playing,

01:49:58.133 --> 01:50:01.552
and we welcome back,
Fast Eddie Felson.

01:50:05.933 --> 01:50:08.101
Players, begin your matches.

01:50:51.353 --> 01:50:54.355
- What are you doing?
- I forfeit.

01:50:54.606 --> 01:50:56.691
- Forfeit?
- Forfeit, Felson has forfeited his match.

01:50:56.775 --> 01:50:59.319
What do you mean, forfeit?
You can't forfeit.

01:50:59.403 --> 01:51:00.903
What's he talking about?
What kind of bullshit is this?

01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:02.155
I don't know.
He just threw 50,000 away.

01:51:02.239 --> 01:51:04.657
Come on, Eddie, don't forfeit.
I don't want to win like this.

01:51:08.412 --> 01:51:11.122
Yeah, but I don't want to
win like that, though.

01:51:30.434 --> 01:51:34.812
The match on Table 3
has been forfeited by Eddie Felson.

01:51:35.647 --> 01:51:38.441
Lorenzo Kennedy wins by default.

01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:53.956
So what do you say?
Why don't we get the hell out of here?

01:51:57.294 --> 01:52:00.463
The Bahamas are looking real good
to me about now.

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:03.633
Anyway,

01:52:04.259 --> 01:52:07.512
I got out of my lease.
All my stuff's in boxes.

01:52:08.389 --> 01:52:09.806
That's nice.

01:52:10.474 --> 01:52:13.309
I'm a real big fan of character in people.

01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:15.478
I don't know if you knew that about me.

01:52:15.938 --> 01:52:17.814
- Character, huh?
- Yeah.

01:52:21.443 --> 01:52:22.944
Here it comes.

01:52:36.708 --> 01:52:37.959
Vincent says this is yours.

01:52:38.043 --> 01:52:40.002
You don't want it,
you should give it to charity.

01:52:40.796 --> 01:52:42.338
What'll that solve?

01:52:42.548 --> 01:52:45.174
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

01:52:45.843 --> 01:52:47.677
I want his best game.

01:52:47.761 --> 01:52:50.596
Look, if you want his best game, Eddie,
go talk to him yourself.

01:52:50.681 --> 01:52:52.098
He won't listen to me.

01:52:52.182 --> 01:52:54.809
- What? So I gotta cover your ass now?
- No.

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:57.019
You gotta save it.

01:52:57.938 --> 01:52:59.605
Why should I?

01:53:03.068 --> 01:53:05.111
I'll be in the green room.

01:53:32.347 --> 01:53:33.723
Stings like a bitch, don't it?

01:53:33.849 --> 01:53:35.308
Yes, it does.

01:53:41.231 --> 01:53:43.900
You got brass, man. I'll give you that.

01:53:44.193 --> 01:53:47.403
You want my game? You couldn't deal
with my game, Jack. You're outmanned.

01:53:47.488 --> 01:53:50.364
Let's find out. I'm asking you.

01:53:50.449 --> 01:53:52.742
I ain't got a leg to stand on,
but I'm asking you.

01:53:52.826 --> 01:53:54.744
- Shove it!
- Don't do that, kid.

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:57.205
I call the shots! I do what I want to do.

01:53:57.289 --> 01:54:00.500
Don't do it.
I don't have that many games left in me.

01:54:00.584 --> 01:54:03.961
God! You used us. You used me!

01:54:04.046 --> 01:54:05.630
Yes, I did.

01:54:05.756 --> 01:54:08.424
But you're in Atlantic City now,
with the big boys.

01:54:08.967 --> 01:54:12.512
You're not back there in the stock room
playing around with baby dolls.

01:54:12.596 --> 01:54:13.596
Think about it.

01:54:14.431 --> 01:54:15.848
It's a wash.

01:54:18.602 --> 01:54:22.563
And about all that other stuff,
I don't take much pride in that.

01:54:22.856 --> 01:54:25.733
It's even, but it ain't settled.
Let's settle it.

01:54:25.817 --> 01:54:28.986
- Why should I?
- How long do you want me to fry, huh?

01:54:29.071 --> 01:54:30.279
Five years, 10 years?

01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:32.782
You want to play
kick the dog for the rest of your life?

01:54:34.826 --> 01:54:36.953
Come on, let's clean it up.

01:54:53.512 --> 01:54:56.347
Listen to this. What? You want to
play for the envelope? Is that it?

01:54:56.431 --> 01:54:57.682
Whatever.

01:55:13.699 --> 01:55:14.907
Thank you.

01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:23.124
Eddie, what are you gonna do
when I kick your ass?

01:55:23.208 --> 01:55:25.918
Pick myself up
and let you kick me again.

01:55:28.046 --> 01:55:30.256
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:55:32.509 --> 01:55:34.802
Just don't put the money
in the bank, kid.

01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:36.053
'Cause if I don't whip you now,

01:55:36.138 --> 01:55:37.930
I'm gonna whip you next month
in Dallas.

01:55:38.015 --> 01:55:40.766
You mean Houston.
There's nothing coming up in Dallas.

01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:45.187
Houston, Dallas. And if not then, then
the month after that in New Orleans.

01:55:45.272 --> 01:55:47.565
Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?

01:55:53.655 --> 01:55:55.740
Hey, I'm back.

01:57:08.105 --> 01:57:12.983
I feel so doggone lonely

01:57:15.278 --> 01:57:20.032
Todayjust isn't my day

01:57:22.452 --> 01:57:26.956
When I got home this morning

01:57:29.501 --> 01:57:34.380
I found a letter on my bed

01:57:36.174 --> 01:57:40.970
When I opened up that letter

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.852
I broke right down and cried

01:57:51.148 --> 01:57:55.735
She said, "Now, Daddy,
I hate to leave you

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.574
"But I'm in love
with another guy"

01:58:06.997 --> 01:58:09.832
I couldn't believe she wrote it

01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:17.047
So I read it over again

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.763
And when I was finished

01:58:26.433 --> 01:58:30.770
The tears came down like rain

01:58:33.315 --> 01:58:37.359
The more I read
this doggone letter

01:58:40.781 --> 01:58:45.159
The more my
poor heart cries

01:58:47.788 --> 01:58:52.082
She said, "Now, Daddy,
I hate to leave you

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.631
"But I'm in love
with another guy"

01:58:59.925 --> 01:59:02.384
My baby, she said

01:59:04.805 --> 01:59:07.556
Oh, yeah,
My baby, she said

01:59:08.558 --> 01:59:12.770
My baby, she said

01:59:13.897 --> 01:59:15.856
This what she said

01:59:16.566 --> 01:59:19.944
She said, "Now, Daddy,
I hate to leave you

01:59:22.572 --> 01:59:27.076
"But I'm in love
with another guy"

01:59:28.305 --> 01:59:34.198
