WEBVTT

00:09.063 --> 00:10.830
Let's give a big welcome

00:10.832 --> 00:14.333
to the Bourbons new
second baseman Jaquan Lewis,

00:14.335 --> 00:16.602
whose journey to the major league began

00:16.604 --> 00:18.804
right here on this field.

00:18.806 --> 00:21.541
Hey, rookie!
Let's show 'em how it's done.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.709
You got it, ace.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.591 --> 00:47.940
Strike!

00:48.460 --> 00:49.559
Hey, man.

00:50.228 --> 00:52.729
I said let's show them how it's done.

01:01.206 --> 01:02.272
Whoo!

01:03.123 --> 01:04.708
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:22.127 --> 01:23.727
All right.

01:26.064 --> 01:27.797
Jaquan.

01:30.402 --> 01:33.370
Proof of the city
of Louisville's big heart...

01:33.372 --> 01:35.672
hundreds of people
lining up for days now

01:35.674 --> 01:40.043
in support of Bourbons rookie
second baseman Jaquan Lewis,

01:40.045 --> 01:42.712
in dire need of a bone-marrow transplant

01:42.714 --> 01:46.750
after being diagnosed last week
with a rare form of leukemia.

01:46.752 --> 01:49.652
Let's talk to some of these
fans and see why they're here.

01:49.654 --> 01:51.221
The Bourbons need Jaquan.

01:51.223 --> 01:53.189
Get well soon, Jaquan! We love you!

01:53.191 --> 01:55.325
All right, let's find
some more people in here.

01:55.327 --> 01:56.259
Ladies.

01:56.261 --> 01:57.460
This team is like family,

01:57.462 --> 01:58.995
and you do anything for your family.

02:02.367 --> 02:05.602
You're going to drive yourself
crazy watching that, Ma.

02:05.604 --> 02:08.455
All of those people, baby.
One of them's got to be a match.

02:11.224 --> 02:12.909
Mrs. Lewis, a word?

02:12.911 --> 02:14.511
Whatever news you've got,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.313
you can say it in front of me, Doc.

02:19.144 --> 02:20.683
Okay, then.

02:23.232 --> 02:24.988
We've confirmed it's a match.

02:26.632 --> 02:27.724
Thank...

02:32.110 --> 02:33.930
What's the problem, Doc?

02:34.367 --> 02:35.632
No donor came forward.

02:36.673 --> 02:39.202
We got this blood sample
sent in anonymously.

02:39.848 --> 02:44.641
And I got this text on my cellphone.

02:47.351 --> 02:50.080
"How much is a human life worth?

02:50.660 --> 02:52.682
Answer noon tomorrow."

02:54.019 --> 02:57.320
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

02:57.637 --> 02:59.456
I'll tell you what it means.

03:00.860 --> 03:05.028
It means they want us to pay.

03:07.332 --> 03:08.398
One minute left.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.933
Young Cody Hallam has ball at the feet.

03:09.935 --> 03:11.935
He passes to Amy.

03:11.937 --> 03:14.838
Saved by Mama Hallam!

03:14.840 --> 03:16.606
Go. There we go. Here we go.

03:16.608 --> 03:17.707
What?

03:17.709 --> 03:20.610
Oh! But Cody Hallam scores!

03:20.612 --> 03:22.145
What?

03:22.147 --> 03:22.946
Why?

03:22.948 --> 03:23.847
Whoa!

03:23.849 --> 03:24.714
Oh!

03:24.716 --> 03:26.015
Okay.

03:26.017 --> 03:27.550
What happened?

03:27.552 --> 03:29.219
I hurt my knee!

03:29.221 --> 03:30.220
All right.

03:32.157 --> 03:33.850
There.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.826
- Better?
- Yeah.

03:37.591 --> 03:38.528
I love you.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.897
What about you, hmm?

03:41.549 --> 03:42.398
Zar.

03:42.849 --> 03:45.511
Maxine Carlson. Says it's urgent.

03:45.937 --> 03:47.270
One second.

03:47.272 --> 03:49.506
- Tell her something's come up.
- Oh...

03:49.508 --> 03:52.175
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Just... Just hear me out, okay?

03:52.177 --> 03:55.211
We get a sitter,
hit up Mulligan's, happy hour,

03:55.213 --> 03:57.180
get sloppy drunk and then...

03:57.567 --> 03:59.816
Rain check. Rain check.

04:00.177 --> 04:02.318
Hey, Max. What's up?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.369
_

04:06.758 --> 04:08.291
Thanks.

04:10.104 --> 04:12.112
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

04:12.114 --> 04:13.179
Where's Eric?

04:13.181 --> 04:14.314
Upstairs,

04:14.316 --> 04:16.216
talking to the baseball player
and the mom.

04:16.218 --> 04:17.817
When was the blood sample received?

04:17.819 --> 04:20.983
4:36 yesterday afternoon via courier.

04:20.986 --> 04:22.655
Text came in minutes later
on the burner.

04:22.657 --> 04:25.558
They're gonna get in touch
later today at 12:00.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.079
Can you believe this?

04:27.081 --> 04:29.966
Ransoming bone marrow...
talk about sick.

04:29.968 --> 04:32.429
The text simply asked
how much a life is worth.

04:32.454 --> 04:34.520
Technically, it's not a ransom.

04:34.522 --> 04:35.755
What's the difference?

04:35.757 --> 04:38.725
If they demanded a ransom,
they could be prosecuted.

04:38.727 --> 04:41.027
They want us to make them an offer.

04:41.029 --> 04:42.762
Or they won't hand it over.

04:42.764 --> 04:44.664
How is it not still a ransom?

04:44.666 --> 04:45.798
Under the law?

04:45.800 --> 04:48.267
They can claim
they just asked for a reward.

04:48.269 --> 04:49.363
Clever.

04:49.365 --> 04:50.803
Yeah.

04:50.805 --> 04:52.405
More like evil.

05:03.753 --> 05:12.202
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:16.069 --> 05:18.069
Mrs. Lewis. Eric Beaumont.

05:18.071 --> 05:19.470
You must be Jaquan.

05:19.472 --> 05:22.345
Ma says you're,
like, a private negotiator.

05:22.347 --> 05:23.941
Yeah, I get called
when it might be dangerous

05:23.943 --> 05:25.576
to involve the police.

05:26.082 --> 05:28.012
So, what makes you any different?

05:28.014 --> 05:29.614
Well, the police
just want to arrest people

05:29.616 --> 05:30.815
when they're breaking the law.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.851
My one-and-only concern
is preservation of life.

05:33.853 --> 05:34.986
Well, you have to move fast.

05:34.988 --> 05:36.487
The doctors say
his leukemia is spreading,

05:36.489 --> 05:38.089
and if he doesn't
get the transplant soon...

05:38.091 --> 05:39.457
Ma.

05:40.593 --> 05:43.027
What's your first move, Mr. Beaumont?

05:43.029 --> 05:44.896
Well, you're in a strong position,

05:45.258 --> 05:46.931
so we're gonna use a negotiating tactic

05:46.933 --> 05:48.099
called demonstration.

05:48.101 --> 05:49.934
We're in a strong position?

05:50.227 --> 05:52.394
That donor's blood
is only of value to you

05:52.396 --> 05:54.229
and only if you receive it soon,

05:54.231 --> 05:56.064
which means it's in their interest

05:56.066 --> 05:58.166
as well as ours to resolve this quickly.

05:58.168 --> 06:00.715
We just need to demonstrate those facts.

06:00.717 --> 06:02.237
You make it sound so simple.

06:02.239 --> 06:03.905
Well, negotiations are rarely simple,

06:03.907 --> 06:05.573
but in this case the facts are.

06:08.092 --> 06:10.730
Um, can... can I speak
with you for a minute?

06:10.755 --> 06:11.854
Sure.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.358
We can't afford to pay you.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.993
I hope the hospital told you that.

06:24.995 --> 06:26.277
Please don't worry, Mrs. Lewis.

06:26.279 --> 06:27.303
People think we're rich,

06:27.305 --> 06:29.618
but Jaquan was
a seventh-round draft pick.

06:29.672 --> 06:31.320
We never even got the signing bonus.

06:31.322 --> 06:32.974
I'm still working two jobs.

06:32.988 --> 06:34.788
My fee has been taken care of.

06:34.790 --> 06:35.789
By who?

06:35.791 --> 06:38.225
Someone who wishes to remain anonymous.

06:38.227 --> 06:42.472
Mrs. Lewis, this Zara Hallam,
my chief investigator,

06:42.539 --> 06:44.760
Oliver Yates,
our psychological profiler,

06:44.780 --> 06:46.780
and Maxine Carlson, my second.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.135
Thank you, all of you, for being here.

06:49.752 --> 06:52.029
Um, w-what happens next?

06:52.089 --> 06:54.855
Well, first we require
what we call "proof of life"

06:54.865 --> 06:57.299
to confirm that
what's being ransomed exists.

06:57.301 --> 06:59.468
Oh, that... that blood sample
matched Jaquan's.

06:59.470 --> 07:00.602
Dr. Rowe said so.

07:00.604 --> 07:03.539
Yeah, we have some, uh,
questions about that.

07:03.541 --> 07:04.606
Like what?

07:04.608 --> 07:06.341
Well, this hospital's the only facility

07:06.343 --> 07:08.077
that knows Jaquan's profile.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.344
So?

07:09.719 --> 07:13.397
So how did whoever send
that sample know it was a match?

07:14.719 --> 07:17.386
Help me!

07:23.394 --> 07:25.461
Help!

07:30.401 --> 07:32.501
Aah!

07:32.803 --> 07:34.436
Come on!

07:34.438 --> 07:36.405
Help me!

07:37.608 --> 07:40.776
22 years old with leukemia. Sucks.

07:40.778 --> 07:41.944
Two years ago he broke

07:41.946 --> 07:44.179
the single-season
college home run record.

07:44.181 --> 07:46.181
The Bourbons are lucky to have him.

07:46.183 --> 07:48.324
Wait a second. I thought
you were a Yankees fan.

07:48.326 --> 07:50.152
You hate the Bourbons.

07:50.154 --> 07:52.054
I'm a rational human being.

07:52.715 --> 07:54.123
Of course I hate the Bourbons.

07:55.539 --> 07:58.293
Tissue typing evaluates
compatibility of HLA

07:58.295 --> 08:00.929
between the donor and the recipient.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.900
Let's pretend for a second
I don't know what HLA is.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.368
Marvin?

08:06.370 --> 08:08.670
Oh, uh, human leukocyte antigens.

08:09.186 --> 08:11.006
We stimulate antibody production

08:11.008 --> 08:14.009
to determine whether
the bone marrow's a match.

08:14.011 --> 08:17.112
Jaquan has accelerated
chronic myeloid leukemia

08:17.114 --> 08:19.148
with a T31-SI gene mutation.

08:19.150 --> 08:21.750
A transplant is his best chance
for a complete cure.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.119
So how many
potential matches for Jaquan

08:24.121 --> 08:25.621
have you processed here?

08:25.623 --> 08:28.188
Thousands, with hundreds more
coming in every day.

08:29.011 --> 08:30.392
And none have been a match?

08:30.394 --> 08:32.660
Not until that sample yesterday.

08:33.020 --> 08:35.097
His particular blood type
makes it difficult

08:35.099 --> 08:36.191
to find a perfect match.

08:36.193 --> 08:38.133
What if we don't find a match?

08:38.135 --> 08:40.202
Then there can't be any transplant.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.605
Could someone test their own HLA
to see if they were a match?

08:44.578 --> 08:45.754
I suppose so.

08:45.756 --> 08:47.147
I mean, if they had the right equipment.

08:47.796 --> 08:50.624
But they wouldn't know
their HLA matched Jaquan's

08:50.626 --> 08:52.398
unless they had a sample
of his blood, too.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.216
Right.

09:00.558 --> 09:01.957
What are you doing?

09:05.095 --> 09:07.062
90-second micronap.

09:07.064 --> 09:08.430
Micronap?

09:08.432 --> 09:11.266
Well, you need them when you
only get three hours of sleep.

09:11.268 --> 09:13.769
You only sleep for three hours?

09:13.771 --> 09:14.636
Well?

09:14.638 --> 09:15.938
Impossible to confirm a match

09:15.940 --> 09:17.806
without access to Jaquan's blood.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.608
Well, obviously not impossible.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.210
They confirmed it somehow.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.912
Maybe someone jabbed him,
stole some of his blood?

09:23.914 --> 09:26.048
Well, they wouldn't need
to physically steal his blood

09:26.050 --> 09:27.983
if they had access
to the hospital's database.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.918
What if someone hacked in from outside

09:29.920 --> 09:31.286
to get Jaquan's profile?

09:31.959 --> 09:33.822
We need tech support.

09:34.272 --> 09:35.958
Of course you do.

09:36.312 --> 09:37.860
Say hi for me.

09:37.862 --> 09:39.027
Say hi to who?

09:40.111 --> 09:42.397
Well, well, well, Oliver Yates.

09:42.399 --> 09:44.833
Hi, Annie. How's Seattle?

09:44.835 --> 09:47.135
- Oh, so you do remember my name, huh.
- Of course.

09:47.137 --> 09:49.304
I mean, look, it's not like
I didn't want to call.

09:49.306 --> 09:50.939
It's just, what,
that you forgot my digits

09:50.941 --> 09:52.207
until you needed something?

09:52.209 --> 09:53.577
Annie...

09:54.211 --> 09:55.377
Who's that with you?

09:55.379 --> 09:56.411
What do you mean?

09:56.413 --> 09:58.013
Hi, Annie. I'm Maxine.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.047
Why are you here?

09:59.049 --> 10:01.583
You're cute, Max. Watch out for him.

10:01.585 --> 10:03.093
Um, okay.

10:03.095 --> 10:05.143
Listen, Annie,
uh, I'm kind of in a rush,

10:05.145 --> 10:06.955
so we need to make this quick, okay?

10:06.957 --> 10:09.091
Well, lucky for you I don't sleep.

10:09.093 --> 10:10.559
Hit me with it, Romeo.

10:12.997 --> 10:14.544
"Romeo"?

10:14.858 --> 10:17.358
How do you feel about hacking
into a hospital database?

10:18.120 --> 10:19.334
All set?

10:19.336 --> 10:21.970
We're patched
into Dr. Rowe's cellphone now.

10:21.972 --> 10:24.409
Any text she gets will show up here.

10:26.136 --> 10:27.442
"You tested the blood?"

10:28.098 --> 10:29.144
Yes.

10:29.146 --> 10:31.046
Positive match.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.582
Response latency is...

10:34.226 --> 10:35.590
"How about a reward?"

10:35.592 --> 10:38.343
Nonexistent.
Somebody's eager to communicate.

10:38.345 --> 10:40.887
How much do you have in mind?

10:49.233 --> 10:51.667
That bone marrow's only
of value to Jaquan Lewis,

10:51.669 --> 10:53.535
and he doesn't have $6 million.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.656
Well, if he dies, everyone loses.

11:07.451 --> 11:10.152
We need to talk... in person.

11:18.028 --> 11:19.970
No response.

11:21.177 --> 11:21.910
They're gone.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.898
Let me help you with that.

11:43.900 --> 11:44.899
I got it, Ma.

11:45.427 --> 11:48.002
Just... Just let me feel useful, baby.

11:56.354 --> 11:57.319
What is it?

11:57.321 --> 11:59.154
What happened with the negotiation?

11:59.456 --> 12:00.990
Nothing happened, that's what.

12:01.328 --> 12:03.092
They hung up on him.

12:03.329 --> 12:04.993
And time is running out.

12:06.329 --> 12:10.032
We know there's a donor, Ma, a match.

12:10.034 --> 12:11.344
This isn't over.

12:12.336 --> 12:15.237
Jaquan, they want $6 million.

12:15.239 --> 12:17.906
We don't have the money.

12:22.607 --> 12:24.656
We didn't come this far to give up.

12:25.313 --> 12:26.782
I'm not giving up now.

12:46.904 --> 12:48.337
Well...?

12:48.339 --> 12:51.173
Well, Annie's working on it,
but she said it could take days

12:51.175 --> 12:53.575
to locate a breach
in the hospital's firewall.

12:53.577 --> 12:55.144
If there was one.

12:55.146 --> 12:57.046
You think this was an inside job?

12:57.048 --> 12:59.715
Check hospital employees
with access to that database.

12:59.717 --> 13:00.616
Will do.

13:00.963 --> 13:02.651
What happened with the reward?

13:03.259 --> 13:04.353
They hung up.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.034
Were they supposed to do that?

13:06.036 --> 13:07.556
Well, they were thrown by my demand

13:07.558 --> 13:08.857
for an in-person meeting.

13:08.859 --> 13:10.826
Clever enough to not ask for a ransom,

13:10.828 --> 13:13.295
too inexperienced
to anticipate your next move.

13:13.297 --> 13:14.496
A crime of opportunity.

13:14.498 --> 13:17.433
Technically known
as making it up as you go along.

13:17.906 --> 13:19.268
Get on those hospital-employee records.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.503
Whoever this is, let's see
if this is an inside job.

13:21.505 --> 13:22.570
Right away.

13:23.614 --> 13:25.574
You want to tell me about Annie, Romeo?

13:25.576 --> 13:27.276
No, Maxine.

13:29.477 --> 13:30.727
Mrs. Lewis?

13:31.883 --> 13:33.394
Mm.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.831
I know you're feeling discouraged,

13:34.833 --> 13:36.125
but we're building a profile

13:36.127 --> 13:37.720
of whoever sent you that blood sample.

13:38.012 --> 13:39.288
But they won't even negotiate.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.557
Well, hanging up the phone
suggests someone

13:41.559 --> 13:44.076
who's emotionally labile, desperate.

13:44.078 --> 13:45.456
We just need a little more time.

13:47.486 --> 13:49.605
Is there something
you haven't told me, Mrs. Lewis?

13:51.544 --> 13:53.001
Jaquan didn't want me to tell you this.

13:53.003 --> 13:54.303
Um...

13:54.632 --> 13:57.045
The transplant
is not the only treatment.

13:58.085 --> 13:59.441
Chemotherapy.

13:59.443 --> 14:01.877
They say it'll reduce his lung capacity.

14:02.630 --> 14:04.113
He'll never play pro ball again.

14:06.717 --> 14:08.095
Let me talk to him.

14:11.432 --> 14:12.456
What's up?

14:12.458 --> 14:14.002
Hey, Mr. Beaumont.

14:17.561 --> 14:18.894
Ooh, Jackie Robinson.

14:18.896 --> 14:21.420
Two outs, bottom of the 9th.

14:21.422 --> 14:23.365
He hits a grand slam to win the game.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.868
Ebbets Field, June 24, 1948.

14:26.854 --> 14:28.637
Dodgers beat the Pirates 8-6.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.527
Jackie's the reason
why I'm a second baseman.

14:32.958 --> 14:34.294
He never gave up.

14:35.295 --> 14:36.912
Yeah, well, you know.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.215
Chemo isn't giving up, Jaquan,

14:40.830 --> 14:42.651
not if it keeps you alive.

14:44.446 --> 14:47.389
My dad died in Fallujah
when I was 6, Mr. Beaumont.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.607
Ever since then,
my mother's been working

14:49.609 --> 14:52.261
two, sometimes three jobs
to make ends meet.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.444
I spent every day after school
hitting balls.

14:59.603 --> 15:01.570
I knew I had skill.

15:02.006 --> 15:04.258
I knew that if I could
make it I could...

15:06.330 --> 15:08.991
provide for her
like she provided for me.

15:10.147 --> 15:15.256
Now if you take that away
from me, I have nothing.

15:16.821 --> 15:18.687
Oh, you know that's not true.

15:18.689 --> 15:20.289
I'm telling you.

15:20.291 --> 15:24.065
In this game, it ain't over.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.837
Excuse me.

15:28.862 --> 15:31.066
Hey, Jaquan. Can I see you?

15:31.068 --> 15:33.027
Be very careful around this woman.

15:33.504 --> 15:35.471
Zara's a huge Yankees fan.

15:36.731 --> 15:38.507
I'm just afraid of what
she might do to you.

15:39.221 --> 15:42.444
Noted. She looks tough, too.

15:43.363 --> 15:44.573
Don't worry.

15:44.575 --> 15:45.914
You're okay...

15:46.721 --> 15:47.649
considering your team.

15:47.651 --> 15:48.750
Oh.

15:48.752 --> 15:51.320
Well, we'll make a fan out of you yet.

15:51.641 --> 15:55.065
You know what? You just might.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.435
We just received a text
from whoever sent the blood.

16:06.437 --> 16:08.670
They've agreed to an in-person meet.

16:28.726 --> 16:29.992
I'm here now.

16:32.162 --> 16:33.295
I understand.

16:37.501 --> 16:38.767
We think we've got her.

16:38.769 --> 16:41.503
20s, blue dress, purposeful.

16:41.884 --> 16:44.273
I think I've seen her somewhere.

16:59.657 --> 17:02.165
Good afternoon. I'm Eric Beaumont.

17:05.678 --> 17:07.061
Okay.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.464
A little more... female than I expected.

17:12.303 --> 17:15.369
Okay, Mr. Beaumont. You got the money?

17:15.372 --> 17:16.771
No, I'm afraid not.

17:16.773 --> 17:19.174
Name is Kim Newham, no priors,

17:19.175 --> 17:21.810
manages a package-and-ship store,

17:21.811 --> 17:22.944
zero medical training.

17:22.946 --> 17:24.780
So she couldn't have
analyzed her own blood.

17:24.781 --> 17:26.381
Props for keeping up.

17:26.383 --> 17:27.616
I'm sorry, Miss,

17:27.617 --> 17:31.353
but Jaquan doesn't have
anything near $6 million.

17:32.456 --> 17:33.555
There's something else on her mind.

17:33.557 --> 17:34.423
She's afraid.

17:34.425 --> 17:36.658
It's $6 million or nothing.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.727
Jaquan's mother wants him
to start chemo,

17:38.729 --> 17:40.829
and if that happens
then you get nothing.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.131
You asked me here to tell me that?

17:43.133 --> 17:44.333
Well, to be honest,

17:44.335 --> 17:46.201
I use any excuse to come
to this restaurant.

17:47.722 --> 17:50.939
I also need a cheek swab.

17:52.129 --> 17:53.642
What for?

17:54.289 --> 17:55.577
To confirm you're the donor.

17:56.001 --> 17:57.346
You've got the blood sample.

17:57.348 --> 17:59.114
Sorry. I'll be in touch.

18:01.729 --> 18:02.951
You want us to follow her?

18:02.953 --> 18:04.453
No. Too risky.
Someone could be watching.

18:04.455 --> 18:06.755
But we do need to verify
she's the donor.

18:07.344 --> 18:08.839
Thought you might say that.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.828
Come with me... girlfriend.

18:22.506 --> 18:24.940
Oh, sorry.

18:28.379 --> 18:29.878
She's taken.

18:30.355 --> 18:31.761
- I'm sorry?
- "I'm sorry?"

18:31.763 --> 18:34.350
I see you eyeing up my woman,
and she's taken.

18:34.352 --> 18:35.917
Oh, my God.

18:35.919 --> 18:37.019
I'm just standing here.

18:37.021 --> 18:38.620
Oh, you're just standing here.

18:38.622 --> 18:39.588
You're doing it again.

18:39.590 --> 18:40.856
I'm doing it again?!

18:40.858 --> 18:43.025
I'm doing it again
because of you and your bimbo!

18:43.027 --> 18:44.059
Excuse me?

18:44.061 --> 18:45.694
I am so sorry about...

18:45.696 --> 18:46.762
Don't you dare! I'll...

18:46.764 --> 18:48.830
- Hey! What the hell?!
- You are such psycho.

18:48.832 --> 18:50.899
Oh, I'm the psycho? She gets really...

18:50.901 --> 18:51.867
- Stop it!
- Oh, my God!

18:51.869 --> 18:52.801
You're both insane!

18:52.803 --> 18:53.769
You know what? You're pathetic!

18:53.771 --> 18:55.137
Every time!

19:04.374 --> 19:05.547
All right.

19:05.983 --> 19:08.016
Here we go.

19:35.825 --> 19:37.245
You wait here, okay?

19:37.247 --> 19:38.346
Okay.

19:56.926 --> 19:58.500
What happened?

19:58.841 --> 20:00.268
This isn't gonna work.

20:01.536 --> 20:04.906
Just stick to what I tell you
and it'll all be fine.

20:05.367 --> 20:07.062
This guy they've hired...

20:08.061 --> 20:09.878
I hope you didn't do anything stupid.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.515
Of course not. Only what you said.

20:15.208 --> 20:16.787
But he said $6 million is impossible

20:16.789 --> 20:17.794
and you'll end up with nothing.

20:17.796 --> 20:20.188
That's what they want you to believe.

20:20.551 --> 20:21.723
They'll find the money.

20:22.624 --> 20:24.760
When you don't have a choice,
you find a way.

20:25.238 --> 20:26.913
They get the money tomorrow...

20:29.758 --> 20:32.502
or Jaquan won't be
the only one that dies.

20:35.214 --> 20:36.605
Understand?

20:36.607 --> 20:38.442
Your sister's life's on you.

20:54.015 --> 20:55.481
Zara says the lab's running

20:55.483 --> 20:57.383
Kim Newham's blood sample right now.

20:57.385 --> 20:59.011
Okay, good.

21:04.538 --> 21:05.625
Out with it.

21:06.858 --> 21:10.049
You told that woman Jaquan's
mother wanted him to get chemo.

21:10.932 --> 21:12.565
So why doesn't he?

21:13.058 --> 21:15.266
Well, because it would end
his baseball career.

21:17.572 --> 21:19.605
That's crazy.

21:20.603 --> 21:21.908
You think?

21:24.242 --> 21:26.228
You've got to talk sense into him.

21:26.982 --> 21:28.348
Well, it's not my place.

21:29.002 --> 21:31.617
Not your place to save his life?

21:32.882 --> 21:35.488
We both know you could change his mind.

21:35.842 --> 21:37.190
Perhaps.

21:38.434 --> 21:40.226
But it's his life.

21:41.496 --> 21:43.296
It's his decision to make.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.726
It's unpaid leave, of course.

21:48.309 --> 21:50.503
Y-You've been watching the news, right?

21:50.505 --> 21:51.885
Y-You know this is my son?

21:52.709 --> 21:54.674
I don't know when, okay?

21:54.854 --> 21:56.342
Okay, all right.

21:56.344 --> 21:58.421
They want you back at work.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.318
I already lost one of my jobs.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.236
I had a single mom, too.
I know how it is.

22:07.989 --> 22:09.689
Divorce?

22:09.691 --> 22:10.623
No.

22:11.173 --> 22:13.493
No, my dad died when I was 11.

22:14.306 --> 22:16.253
It must have felt
like your whole world ended.

22:17.956 --> 22:19.832
After my grandma died, he, um...

22:20.568 --> 22:23.002
He gave me this necklace for protection.

22:23.705 --> 22:26.072
Said it would keep me safe always.

22:26.074 --> 22:27.573
You got kids?

22:27.958 --> 22:29.876
A boy and a girl.

22:30.250 --> 22:31.544
I know they say you're not supposed

22:31.546 --> 22:33.046
to make your kids your life.

22:33.048 --> 22:34.394
You're supposed to live for yourself.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.284
That's a bunch of bull, right?

22:38.810 --> 22:40.923
That boy is my whole world.

22:42.147 --> 22:45.158
What can you tell us about
his contract with the Bourbons?

22:45.160 --> 22:47.994
There is no contract with the Bourbons.

22:50.218 --> 22:53.399
They cancelled it as soon
as they found out he was sick.

22:56.574 --> 22:58.561
We appreciate your position.

22:58.563 --> 23:01.464
The Bourbons are one big family,
Ms. Carlson,

23:01.466 --> 23:04.333
and all our thoughts
are with Jaquan Lewis,

23:04.335 --> 23:06.647
praying he makes a swift
and full recovery.

23:07.683 --> 23:10.079
A lot of people came out
to support Jaquan.

23:10.441 --> 23:12.254
It won't look very good
when they find out

23:12.256 --> 23:13.818
the Bourbons voided his contract

23:13.820 --> 23:15.247
as soon as you found out he was sick.

23:15.641 --> 23:18.008
Well, I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do about that.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.413
You're a billion-dollar-a-year
franchise, Ms. Bulla...

23:22.850 --> 23:25.783
$6 million reward's pocket change.

23:29.273 --> 23:32.122
Jaquan's contract was voided
because he'd already experienced

23:32.124 --> 23:34.959
symptoms that he didn't disclose
during negotiations.

23:35.557 --> 23:37.962
Those symptoms should have been
reported to us at once.

23:37.964 --> 23:39.830
They were undiagnosed symptoms.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.966
There was no willful deception.

23:44.337 --> 23:46.203
Our lawyers don't concur.

23:47.189 --> 23:49.139
You want to add anything, Eric?

23:51.893 --> 23:53.744
Well, I guess we're done here then.

23:54.077 --> 23:55.212
Can I keep the pen?

24:01.854 --> 24:03.721
There's a plan here, right?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.715
We didn't come here to talk to them.

24:06.938 --> 24:08.225
Yo, Blair.

24:09.262 --> 24:10.895
She wants your autograph.

24:10.897 --> 24:12.696
I'm actually going to kill you.

24:13.031 --> 24:14.465
Where do you want me to sign?

24:15.454 --> 24:18.168
A large check
for Jaquan Lewis would do it.

24:18.967 --> 24:20.704
We're forbidden to contribute
to any ransom...

24:20.706 --> 24:22.963
legalese in our contracts.

24:23.643 --> 24:25.309
I appreciate you coming by,
Mr. Beaumont.

24:25.311 --> 24:26.143
No problem.

24:26.554 --> 24:27.444
How's it going?

24:27.446 --> 24:29.578
Well, the clock's running down,
but we'll get there.

24:30.459 --> 24:32.416
Have you ever seen this woman before?

24:33.886 --> 24:35.019
Who is she?

24:35.852 --> 24:38.011
The woman who could save Jaquan's life.

24:39.133 --> 24:42.092
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

24:42.094 --> 24:43.127
Ah, that's all right.

24:43.129 --> 24:44.361
I didn't think you'd recognize her.

24:44.363 --> 24:45.619
Just had to be sure.

24:46.826 --> 24:48.732
If there's anything more,
you let me know.

24:52.338 --> 24:54.505
I'll give you that autograph later.

24:58.355 --> 24:59.677
He's the client.

25:00.659 --> 25:01.755
Could be.

25:02.281 --> 25:03.647
So, what happens now?

25:03.931 --> 25:07.584
The woman at the restaurant...
You said she looked familiar.

25:07.954 --> 25:09.883
Yeah, I could swear I saw her someplace.

25:10.524 --> 25:12.089
Find out where.

25:19.006 --> 25:20.364
Got news for you.

25:22.116 --> 25:23.701
Analysis from that blood sample

25:23.703 --> 25:25.436
that we took from Kim at the restaurant.

25:25.936 --> 25:26.853
And?

25:26.855 --> 25:28.616
Confirmed she's a match.

25:29.241 --> 25:30.296
Really?

25:31.685 --> 25:32.731
What?

25:32.756 --> 25:35.045
She was scared when I talked to her.

25:35.047 --> 25:36.580
Something's not right.

25:36.582 --> 25:38.549
Mrs. Lewis, what's happened?

25:38.551 --> 25:39.817
It's Jaquan.

25:40.395 --> 25:43.118
His white blood cells are too
weak to fight off infections.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.835
He's developing pneumonia.

25:46.949 --> 25:48.826
When are you speaking
to the donor again?

25:50.230 --> 25:52.997
Well, she gave us until this
afternoon to raise the ransom.

25:52.999 --> 25:54.507
We don't have it.

25:55.173 --> 25:57.768
Can Jaquan wait another day
to start the treatment?

26:00.021 --> 26:01.238
I can't answer that.

26:02.623 --> 26:04.408
But if I were in your shoes, Mrs. Lewis,

26:04.737 --> 26:07.735
I'd persuade my son
to start the chemo... now.

26:09.248 --> 26:10.748
Easy.

26:14.903 --> 26:16.556
Text message just came in.

26:16.558 --> 26:17.621
Kim Newham wants to meet you

26:17.623 --> 26:19.419
at Cherokee Park with the ransom.

26:19.421 --> 26:22.192
But hold on. You need to see this first.

26:22.194 --> 26:24.427
Let's find some more people
in here. Ladies.

26:24.429 --> 26:25.767
This team is like family,

26:25.769 --> 26:26.697
and you do anything for your family.

26:26.699 --> 26:28.275
I knew I'd seen her somewhere.

26:29.168 --> 26:31.151
We searched local
news reports and found this.

26:31.153 --> 26:33.305
Kim Newham was getting tested
at the church

26:33.307 --> 26:35.333
between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.
three days ago.

26:35.335 --> 26:37.228
But someone still had to confirm
she was a match.

26:37.253 --> 26:39.510
We didn't get zip from
the hospital-employee records.

26:39.512 --> 26:40.744
Who's that with her?

26:41.667 --> 26:43.647
That's Lisa, her younger sister.

26:43.649 --> 26:45.649
So she donated, as well.

26:45.938 --> 26:46.917
Can you try reaching her?

26:46.919 --> 26:47.885
I'm on it.

26:47.887 --> 26:49.787
Give me a second.

26:50.466 --> 26:53.057
Annie, what'cha got for me?

26:53.433 --> 26:55.025
Have I ever let you down?

26:56.524 --> 26:58.228
There was a breach
in the hospital firewall.

26:58.230 --> 27:00.931
Someone got hold
of Jaquan's HLA profile.

27:00.933 --> 27:01.865
When?

27:01.867 --> 27:03.200
Couple days ago.

27:03.672 --> 27:04.768
Yeah, after that video was taken.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.970
Yeah, I back-traced the breach.

27:07.330 --> 27:08.238
Did you get a name?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.073
No.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.208
But I did get an address.

27:11.450 --> 27:13.477
Thank you, Annie. You're amazing.

27:13.915 --> 27:15.913
That's what I keep telling you, Oliver.

27:17.149 --> 27:19.683
Lisa Newham hasn't showed up
for work in two days.

27:20.179 --> 27:21.289
Go to the address

27:21.291 --> 27:23.352
of whoever hacked the hospital database.

27:25.022 --> 27:26.857
Oliver, come with me.
We got to get going.

27:28.594 --> 27:30.861
Help!

27:31.939 --> 27:33.330
Aah!

27:39.720 --> 27:41.772
Let's see if our hacker's home.

28:01.996 --> 28:03.627
No one home.

28:11.424 --> 28:14.920
So, we're breaking the law,
just to be clear.

28:16.257 --> 28:18.571
You want to save Jaquan or not?

28:53.996 --> 28:55.646
Open it.

29:03.647 --> 29:05.923
Act like everything's fine.

29:06.213 --> 29:07.057
Where's the money?

29:08.429 --> 29:09.682
I told you Jaquan didn't have it.

29:09.684 --> 29:10.594
Are they watching us?

29:10.596 --> 29:11.562
Who?

29:11.564 --> 29:13.163
Whoever's making you do this, Kim.

29:14.032 --> 29:15.098
You know my name?

29:15.391 --> 29:17.521
And I knew you'd never blackmail Jaquan.

29:18.828 --> 29:20.785
Someone's holding something over you...

29:22.289 --> 29:24.074
like the life of your sister.

29:42.236 --> 29:44.061
So, what are we looking for?

29:44.533 --> 29:46.997
Annie traced the hack to this address.

30:02.419 --> 30:04.214
Marvin Hofstedter.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.567
I'm getting too heavy for you, Mom.

30:23.569 --> 30:25.636
You are never too heavy
for me, sweet boy.

30:25.638 --> 30:27.156
I got you.

30:29.029 --> 30:30.207
There you go.

30:32.319 --> 30:34.177
Jaquan can't wait any longer, Kim.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.111
I donate and they'll kill Lisa.

30:36.113 --> 30:38.448
You can save
your sister's life and Jaquan's,

30:38.450 --> 30:39.983
but only if you trust me.

30:39.985 --> 30:41.161
How?

30:41.163 --> 30:42.019
Zip up the bag,

30:42.021 --> 30:44.597
tell them you have the money
and that you want to meet.

30:45.491 --> 30:46.623
I'll follow you.

31:45.828 --> 31:47.551
There's no one down here.

31:49.088 --> 31:50.387
Hold it right there.

31:50.389 --> 31:52.389
I don't want to hurt you,
but I swear to God,

31:52.391 --> 31:54.691
you make one more move,
and I will shoot you dead.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.930
Call an ambulance.

32:12.071 --> 32:14.138
Zara!

32:17.189 --> 32:18.676
What is it?

32:20.513 --> 32:22.332
Let's find out who they are.

32:24.441 --> 32:26.117
Please, I was just trying to help.

32:26.732 --> 32:28.518
Yeah, who's gonna help my son?

32:28.520 --> 32:31.055
Well, if you kill me,
I can't help Jaquan or your son.

32:31.057 --> 32:34.702
If I can't help my son,
then I don't want to live.

32:35.361 --> 32:36.765
You understand?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.323
I don't want live.

32:41.667 --> 32:44.035
All doctors to the E.R.

32:44.037 --> 32:47.004
All nurses to the nurses' station.

32:50.877 --> 32:52.212
Mr. Beaumont.

32:53.622 --> 32:55.780
Ms. Newham can't donate
her bone marrow now,

32:55.782 --> 32:57.160
not in her injured state.

32:57.162 --> 32:58.320
I'll prepare the chemo.

32:58.345 --> 33:00.105
If Jaquan wants to start
the chemo, that's his call,

33:00.130 --> 33:02.219
but this wasn't
your last chance, Mrs. Lewis.

33:02.221 --> 33:05.102
The paramedics found this
in Ms. Newham's purse.

33:06.092 --> 33:07.658
I don't understand.

33:07.660 --> 33:09.643
It says she's allergic latex.

33:09.645 --> 33:12.563
If you're allergic to latex,
you can't donate bone marrow.

33:12.565 --> 33:15.032
The lab would have checked
before they ran her blood.

33:15.034 --> 33:17.289
Kim Newham thought she was
the donor, but she isn't.

33:17.950 --> 33:19.037
Her sister is.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.960
And we need to find her.

33:30.234 --> 33:32.465
Marvin Hofstedter, form the lab.

33:32.467 --> 33:33.417
You remember me, don't you?

33:33.419 --> 33:34.885
You broke into my home?

33:34.887 --> 33:36.320
Where's Lisa Newham?

33:36.322 --> 33:37.506
I'm calling the police.

33:37.508 --> 33:38.556
Go right ahead.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.491
We have got plenty to tell them.

33:40.493 --> 33:42.760
Like how you found a match for Jaquan,

33:42.762 --> 33:45.896
withheld it from the hospital,
and kidnapped Lisa Newham.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.165
You falsifying hospital records,

33:48.574 --> 33:51.202
lying to us about that blood
test yesterday...

33:51.204 --> 33:52.970
And hacking the firewall
from your laptop

33:52.972 --> 33:54.438
to avoid incriminating yourself.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.974
I wouldn't have a clue of how
to hack a security system.

33:56.976 --> 34:00.144
Really? That's so strange.

34:00.146 --> 34:01.378
Because your résumé says

34:01.380 --> 34:03.914
you have two years of computer science.

34:06.927 --> 34:09.887
That's your ex-wife and your son,

34:10.232 --> 34:11.789
is it not, Mr. Hofstedter?

34:12.152 --> 34:15.040
We found three tickets for you
to fly to Buenos Aires.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.728
It's best you tell us now

34:17.730 --> 34:19.047
where you're holding Lisa Newham.

34:20.166 --> 34:21.652
Gabriel Hofstedter...

34:21.655 --> 34:24.702
born with glycogen storage
disease type II,

34:24.704 --> 34:26.533
otherwise known as Pompe's disease.

34:26.973 --> 34:27.838
Which is...?

34:27.840 --> 34:29.206
It's an inherited disease.

34:29.208 --> 34:31.408
Symptoms include extreme muscle weakness

34:31.409 --> 34:32.860
and an enlarged heart,

34:32.862 --> 34:34.678
which predisposes him to heart failure.

34:34.679 --> 34:35.813
Is there a treatment?

34:35.815 --> 34:36.847
There is,

34:36.849 --> 34:39.917
but the medication costs
$300,000 a year,

34:39.918 --> 34:42.353
and he needs to take it
for the rest of his life.

34:42.355 --> 34:43.920
Insurance companies won't pay,

34:43.922 --> 34:45.489
never mind the chronic physical therapy

34:45.492 --> 34:47.558
and the constant hospitalization.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.693
The Hofstedters went bankrupt
two years ago,

34:49.695 --> 34:51.328
got divorced last year.

34:51.330 --> 34:52.862
- Little wonder.
- Yeah.

34:52.864 --> 34:55.399
They must have though
ransoming Lisa Newham's blood

34:55.400 --> 34:56.905
was their golden ticket.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.175
Bradley, it's Eric.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.033
Eric! How's my man Jaquan?

35:04.058 --> 35:05.024
Hanging in there.

35:05.111 --> 35:06.810
Hey, you haven't told him about me?

35:06.812 --> 35:08.612
I don't want him to feel indebted.

35:08.614 --> 35:09.880
I haven't, and I won't.

35:09.882 --> 35:12.049
But I have a proposition
for you, Bradley?

35:12.051 --> 35:13.417
If I pay Jaquan ransom

35:13.419 --> 35:16.320
the team's gonna suspend
my contract, Mr. Beaumont.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.922
This is not a ransom.

35:17.924 --> 35:20.163
It's a way to save two lives
instead of one.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.470
Thank you.

35:51.511 --> 35:52.855
Mary?

35:54.512 --> 35:55.960
Who are you?

35:55.962 --> 35:58.151
I'm Eric Beaumont. This is Oliver Yates.

35:59.932 --> 36:01.415
We're negotiators.

36:04.870 --> 36:07.338
Gabe, go in the next room.

36:07.752 --> 36:09.340
Go on. It's okay.

36:09.903 --> 36:11.576
Be in there in a minute.

36:17.516 --> 36:21.118
Get in here. Get in.

36:23.189 --> 36:24.955
Kim caved, didn't she?

36:24.957 --> 36:26.757
No, your ex-husband told us.

36:27.557 --> 36:29.483
Kim Newham's been hit by a car.

36:29.515 --> 36:31.655
She's in intensive care right now.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.931
Where's my money?

36:33.933 --> 36:37.448
Oh, there is no money, Mary.
There never was.

36:37.450 --> 36:38.769
You're lying.

36:39.532 --> 36:41.639
I don't think you
want to hurt anyone, Mary,

36:41.641 --> 36:44.541
least of all a good man
like Jaquan Lewis.

36:44.543 --> 36:46.414
Why not? He got lucky.

36:46.979 --> 36:48.728
You know what... what my son got?

36:49.215 --> 36:50.629
There's all kinds of luck.

36:52.398 --> 36:55.152
Jaquan's father died when he was 6.

36:55.154 --> 36:56.587
You want me to feel sorry for him?

36:56.589 --> 36:59.056
Gabe still has two loving parents.

36:59.058 --> 37:00.958
Well, my love doesn't help my son

37:00.960 --> 37:02.826
with this seizures and his pain.

37:02.828 --> 37:05.596
Taking Jaquan's life
is not gonna help him, either.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.243
Well, the money will.

37:08.607 --> 37:10.900
He's a baseball player. He's rich.

37:10.925 --> 37:14.949
Jaquan's contract was canceled
after he got sick.

37:14.974 --> 37:17.916
They even voided his signing bonus.

37:18.444 --> 37:19.743
You were in such a hurry

37:19.745 --> 37:21.542
when your ex-husband found a donor,

37:21.544 --> 37:22.847
you wouldn't have known.

37:25.798 --> 37:27.615
Well, then it's over.

37:28.233 --> 37:30.333
Mary, you're too good of a
mother to leave Gabe on his own.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.868
No. I'm not a good mother.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.670
I can't even take care of him.

37:33.672 --> 37:36.112
I can help you, if you'll let me.

37:37.085 --> 37:38.608
No one can.

37:38.610 --> 37:40.544
I just got off the phone
with Bradley Blair,

37:40.546 --> 37:41.845
the Bourbons pitcher.

37:41.847 --> 37:44.114
He and some of the other players
are willing to put money

37:44.116 --> 37:46.113
into a fund for your son.

37:47.169 --> 37:49.896
Enough so that he can get
proper medical treatment.

37:52.336 --> 37:53.790
Why would they do that?

37:53.792 --> 37:57.561
The money will only be released
if Jaquan gets his transplant.

38:01.633 --> 38:03.337
What do you say, Mary?

38:03.769 --> 38:09.372
Your son and Jaquan... everybody lives.

38:11.076 --> 38:13.243
But Gabe will have a future.

38:13.936 --> 38:16.296
Wasn't that what this was all about?

38:25.524 --> 38:27.224
You did it.

38:28.867 --> 38:29.800
Okay.

38:29.962 --> 38:31.818
It's gonna be okay. Okay?

38:31.843 --> 38:33.003
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:46.678 --> 38:47.644
Okay.

38:47.646 --> 38:49.079
Thank you.

38:49.081 --> 38:51.114
And Jaquan still needs that transplant,

38:51.489 --> 38:52.782
if you're willing to give it.

38:52.784 --> 38:53.917
Yes.

39:03.178 --> 39:04.956
It's all just luck, isn't it...

39:05.837 --> 39:08.298
life, death, sickness, health?

39:08.643 --> 39:11.868
Mr. Beaumont, Jaquan's out of surgery.

39:11.870 --> 39:13.398
He's asking for you.

39:18.978 --> 39:20.015
Bottom of the 9th,

39:20.017 --> 39:21.876
and you hit a grand slam after all.

39:24.395 --> 39:27.123
Kim Newham... How's she doing?

39:27.853 --> 39:29.186
Still in intensive care,

39:29.188 --> 39:31.354
but the doctor's say
she's gonna be okay.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.490
I will never excuse those people

39:33.492 --> 39:35.163
for what they did to those girls.

39:35.727 --> 39:36.993
But that poor boy.

39:36.995 --> 39:39.029
Well, he's with his aunt and uncle now.

39:39.031 --> 39:40.197
The team will make sure

39:40.199 --> 39:41.925
he gets the best treatment
money can buy.

39:41.927 --> 39:44.868
Zara sends her best,
but she needed to be somewhere.

39:45.391 --> 39:47.167
Please tell her I say thank you.

39:48.774 --> 39:50.126
Thank you all.

39:53.230 --> 39:55.145
She wanted you to have this

39:55.894 --> 39:57.998
for as long as you and Jaquan need it.

40:31.669 --> 40:33.260
How ya feeling?

40:33.919 --> 40:35.429
I feel lucky...

40:36.755 --> 40:39.318
very, very lucky.
