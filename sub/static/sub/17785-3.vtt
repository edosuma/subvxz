01:06.801 --> 01:07.801
What is it?

01:07.881 --> 01:09.681
Turn on the TV, look at the news

01:09.761 --> 01:13.001
and find an explanation
for when I'll call you back later.

01:13.441 --> 01:17.641
<i>...Parisian region, it's the biggest
drug seizure ever in the capital.</i>

01:17.721 --> 01:22.361
<i>The police found over 600 kilos
of heroin as well as heavy weapons.</i>

01:28.201 --> 01:29.761
Yes, Mr Minister.

01:30.921 --> 01:32.001
Good.

01:32.361 --> 01:33.641
Mr Brabant!

01:34.201 --> 01:36.201
Mr Brabant! Mr Brabant, please!

01:36.281 --> 01:37.481
Stay back, gentlemen.

01:39.161 --> 01:41.201
Who called them? You?

01:42.201 --> 01:44.761
- Walter, did you call the journalists?
- No.

01:45.601 --> 01:48.641
If it wasn't Walter, it wasn't me.
Why would I call them, anyway?

01:49.121 --> 01:51.041
Maybe to put pressure on the minister.

01:51.401 --> 01:54.961
In case he told you off for leading
this operation without authorisation.

01:55.041 --> 01:58.321
Why would he tell off
cops who are doing their job?

01:58.961 --> 02:01.601
- That's not his intention, is it?
- No.

02:01.681 --> 02:03.201
He's letting you do it.

02:03.841 --> 02:05.121
Up to a certain point.

02:05.561 --> 02:08.520
So everything is good,
Mr Chief Superintendent.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.681
- Chief Superintendent!
- Mr Brabant!

02:19.761 --> 02:21.441
Over here, sir, please!

02:47.601 --> 02:50.361
<i>...catch the offenders red-handed.</i>

02:50.441 --> 02:53.921
<i>A long chase took them to
this quiet village to the south of Paris,</i>

02:54.001 --> 02:56.761
<i>in this pig farm, used as a hub
for large-scale drug trafficking.</i>

02:56.841 --> 02:58.281
You know, Eddy.

02:59.321 --> 03:00.601
You caught me off-guard,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.361
when you took your balaclava off
to call Brabant.

03:02.441 --> 03:05.201
Let me remind you that our only goal is
to take Baba Aroudj down.

03:05.561 --> 03:09.761
We'll keep hitting his organisation until
he loses his diplomatic immunity.

03:09.961 --> 03:11.401
We'll do as we said.

03:11.481 --> 03:13.761
And then what?
In custody and a trial?

03:13.841 --> 03:17.321
And my kids will have to keep seeing
his face and live their assault again!

03:17.401 --> 03:19.401
What's the other option, Walter?

03:19.481 --> 03:21.601
Take him to the woods
and shoot him right in the head?

03:22.961 --> 03:24.321
Maybe, yeah.

03:24.921 --> 03:27.121
Do you want to finish your life
like Charlie?

03:27.201 --> 03:31.401
Run away with your family
and keep looking over your shoulder?

03:32.721 --> 03:34.241
As long as we stay within the rules,

03:34.321 --> 03:36.241
we'll be safe
from the Turks and Brabant.

03:36.321 --> 03:38.881
Baba Aroudj will pay.
For everything he did.

03:38.961 --> 03:41.481
Especially what he did to your kids,
believe me.

03:46.161 --> 03:47.201
Hi, Roxanne.

03:47.281 --> 03:50.441
What the hell? Do I have to turn on
the TV to know where you are?

03:57.961 --> 04:01.081
<i>H端seyin can't be with us.
He asked me to talk to you.</i>

04:01.721 --> 04:04.481
I don't know how Caplan
and Morlighem found the pig farm.

04:04.841 --> 04:07.681
<i>Finding out who gave us to the police
is not a priority right now.</i>

04:08.001 --> 04:09.721
<i>We need to stop the bleeding first.</i>

04:10.281 --> 04:11.281
<i>Do you understand, Baba?</i>

04:11.681 --> 04:13.841
I'm in Marseille,
what do you want me to do?

04:13.921 --> 04:17.161
<i>This attack against our organisation
is on the front page of all the papers.</i>

04:17.521 --> 04:20.961
<i>H端seyin thinks the Marseillais will
take the opportunity to raise their price.</i>

04:21.201 --> 04:24.961
I negotiated with Mandeville.
He gave his word.

04:25.401 --> 04:28.521
<i>He gave you his word, not his boss's.</i>

04:28.681 --> 04:31.601
<i>Listen, H端seyin wants to come to
an agreement with the Marseillais</i>

04:31.681 --> 04:34.561
<i>as soon as possible.
We are counting on you.</i>

04:35.601 --> 04:36.601
<i>Thanks, Fatin.</i>

04:37.201 --> 04:41.401
<i>And thank H端seyin for trusting me.
I won't disappoint him.</i>

04:41.961 --> 04:42.961
I understand, of course.

04:47.801 --> 04:49.081
Get ready.

04:57.201 --> 05:00.401
You're going to war with the Turks.
What about me in all that?

05:02.281 --> 05:04.361
This war, Roxanne, is mine first of all.

05:04.881 --> 05:06.681
I wanted to lead it on my own

05:07.241 --> 05:09.321
but Eddy convinced me
it wasn't the best option.

05:09.401 --> 05:11.441
Especially with Brabant
hovering around us.

05:11.521 --> 05:13.321
You've been assigned
to Bernardi, anyway.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.361
We'll do all we can to get you back
but for now, we're as stuck as you.

05:21.081 --> 05:22.321
I have to go.

05:26.321 --> 05:29.281
I'm tired of your spiel,
I know you're hiding something from me.

05:30.401 --> 05:31.521
Bye, then.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.361
Do you know what happened
to the Turks?

05:43.241 --> 05:47.281
When I found out,
I wondered how the Parisian cops

05:47.361 --> 05:50.241
found out that the Turks were using
pigs to move drugs.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.601
Go figure!

05:52.401 --> 05:54.801
Maybe they have some
geniuses in the police in Paris.

05:54.881 --> 05:56.321
Something is bothering me, Joseph.

05:56.521 --> 05:57.641
Yes?

05:57.721 --> 06:00.281
You asked me to go negotiate
with partners

06:00.361 --> 06:03.161
and you go behind their back
to give them away to the cops.

06:03.241 --> 06:05.961
The Turks need me,
their business is not doing well.

06:06.921 --> 06:09.481
They want that partnership
to build it back.

06:10.801 --> 06:13.761
So whoever gives them away
doesn't really matter.

06:14.281 --> 06:16.281
What really matters, however,

06:16.361 --> 06:19.881
is to know how much they'll have to pay
to go through me.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.041
Joseph.

06:23.761 --> 06:25.801
Hadn't we already negotiated the price?

06:25.881 --> 06:29.081
Go see Aroudj and tell him the prices
have gone up

06:29.281 --> 06:31.201
since I saw the news.

06:32.801 --> 06:34.921
When a partner attracts the cops

06:35.601 --> 06:39.241
like a rotting carcass attracts flies,
it makes me sick, do you get it?

06:39.321 --> 06:41.601
- What if they refuse?
- They won't refuse.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.281
Paris is going to be too hot for them.

06:44.761 --> 06:50.161
I sorted things out so that Marseille
becomes the only profitable market.

06:50.401 --> 06:51.401
So...

06:54.401 --> 06:57.801
they'll take the price we give them,
full stop. Right.

06:58.641 --> 07:00.521
- Bye.
- See you, bye.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.041
You gave me your word, Mr Mandeville.

08:46.121 --> 08:47.641
No, sir.

08:47.721 --> 08:50.521
I gave my word to a professional
representing an organisation,

08:50.601 --> 08:53.441
not to a tearful father leading a vendetta
against a cop.

08:53.521 --> 08:55.601
That is none of your business.

08:55.681 --> 08:59.441
When the policeman you tried
to kill seizes your drugs,

08:59.521 --> 09:01.881
this affair becomes
my and my boss's problem.

09:01.961 --> 09:05.561
How did they know that
we used a pig farm to move the drugs?

09:06.681 --> 09:08.281
Someone grassed you up.

09:08.761 --> 09:11.361
Now, if you think that this came from us,

09:11.441 --> 09:14.801
I'm going to have to reconsider
how intelligent I thought you were.

09:14.881 --> 09:16.401
Remember, Baba,

09:16.841 --> 09:18.361
we didn't come to you.

09:19.241 --> 09:20.961
We agreed to do business with you

09:21.041 --> 09:23.201
because you seemed like
a solid organisation.

09:23.281 --> 09:26.081
But it's looking a lot less stable
than my boss thought.

09:26.561 --> 09:29.241
If you didn't give the information
to the police,

09:29.921 --> 09:31.401
who did?

09:32.201 --> 09:34.681
Apart from those two cops,
Morlighem and Caplan,

09:35.161 --> 09:37.401
can't you think of anyone
who would like to see you fall?

09:41.441 --> 09:44.761
I'm going to think about your new rates,
Mr Mandeville,

09:45.401 --> 09:47.801
as well as what you just told me.

11:08.681 --> 11:09.721
Come in.

11:24.441 --> 11:25.721
I can't believe it.

11:27.081 --> 11:28.121
What?

11:30.121 --> 11:32.161
You kept our parents' apartment.

11:33.321 --> 11:36.961
They wanted me to keep it so you'd
have a home when you came out.

11:40.441 --> 11:41.441
What did I do?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.601
What did I do, Eddy?

11:54.401 --> 11:55.961
Want a coffee?

12:22.481 --> 12:24.561
I left an envelope for you in the hallway.

12:25.041 --> 12:27.801
There's some money,
my number and a mobile.

12:30.721 --> 12:32.361
Kasari gave me this for you.

12:33.321 --> 12:35.521
- Kasari?
- The guy who burnt Vogel.

12:40.681 --> 12:41.681
I see.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.201
Do you want me to come with you?

12:44.281 --> 12:46.761
No, I'll deal with this, don't worry.

12:46.841 --> 12:48.681
What about the 50,000 euros?

12:49.401 --> 12:51.281
I've got the proceeds from the barge.

12:51.641 --> 12:53.281
Why don't you come live here?

12:53.721 --> 12:54.961
There's enough space for two.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.121
This apartment is your space, Nathan.

12:57.201 --> 12:59.161
The place where you start afresh.

13:05.361 --> 13:07.681
There's a change of clothes on the bed.

13:11.441 --> 13:12.681
See you.

13:51.401 --> 13:52.481
<i>Yes?</i>

13:52.841 --> 13:56.041
Yes, hi, I'm Lieutenant Delgado,
I work with Major Caplan.

13:56.481 --> 13:57.721
<i>My brother just left.</i>

13:59.321 --> 14:01.001
I know, I just saw him.

14:07.201 --> 14:08.481
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:09.201 --> 14:11.361
- Can I see your ID?
- Yes, of course.

14:17.761 --> 14:19.561
Pleased to meet you,
Lieutenant Delgado.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.041
I prefer Roxanne.

14:21.921 --> 14:23.001
Nathan.

14:23.881 --> 14:25.041
Pleased to meet you.

14:25.121 --> 14:28.681
Your brother sent me to take over,
so if you need to go anywhere, I'm here.

14:29.761 --> 14:30.801
Come in.

14:32.641 --> 14:34.401
I didn't know Eddy had a brother.

14:35.121 --> 14:36.921
We were separated for a long time.

14:39.001 --> 14:40.681
Take a seat, I'll be right back.

15:23.521 --> 15:24.521
Eddy Caplan?

15:26.441 --> 15:28.801
I'm guessing you're Kasari's courier.

15:28.881 --> 15:30.401
I'm no one's courier.

15:30.481 --> 15:31.601
Good for you.

15:34.641 --> 15:36.721
Fifty thousand euros for the contract.

15:41.681 --> 15:42.841
What's that for?

15:42.921 --> 15:44.841
Don't get this wrong, Caplan.

15:44.921 --> 15:46.601
I'm not threatening you,
I'm protecting myself.

15:46.681 --> 15:48.881
I'm paying, as we agreed.
What's the problem?

15:49.521 --> 15:51.161
There have been some changes.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.921
You're going to pay differently.

15:53.441 --> 15:54.601
How?

15:54.681 --> 15:58.321
Since my cousin beat up your brother,
his situation is unbearable in prison.

15:58.761 --> 16:01.121
The new head prison guard
won't stop bothering him.

16:01.201 --> 16:03.681
- How is that my problem?
- I'm getting to it!

16:03.761 --> 16:08.321
My cousin could get some peace
by giving to one of the IGPN's cops,

16:08.401 --> 16:09.401
Brabant,

16:09.721 --> 16:11.921
what he wants. Meaning you.

16:12.601 --> 16:14.041
So the new deal is this.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.561
My cousin is planning to escape
and you're going to help.

16:18.521 --> 16:20.801
Or he'll grass up
you and your brother to Brabant.

16:20.881 --> 16:23.281
If he talks, he'll be confessing
to premeditated murder.

16:23.361 --> 16:24.801
What are they going to do to him?

16:24.881 --> 16:26.241
Give him another life sentence?

16:26.481 --> 16:28.641
Seeing how much Brabant wants you,

16:28.721 --> 16:31.601
I'm pretty sure my cousin
will still get a little bonus.

16:32.681 --> 16:34.161
Sorry, Caplan.

16:35.321 --> 16:38.321
You'll be really sorry if you keep on
pointing that gun at me.

16:38.401 --> 16:40.561
All right, copper, I'll remember.

16:40.641 --> 16:43.321
You have my number, I have yours.
We'll keep in touch.

16:58.001 --> 17:01.241
According to Charlie's info,
this is the target we need to hit now.

17:01.441 --> 17:03.561
Do you think Baba Aroudj
will react after that?

17:04.001 --> 17:05.001
I hope so.

17:11.441 --> 17:13.921
Equality of the sexes isn't a big thing
in this neighbourhood.

17:14.001 --> 17:16.521
- What do you mean?
- The laundrette.

17:16.601 --> 17:19.601
Women come in with dirty laundry
and men with dirty money.

17:20.881 --> 17:22.881
What kind of comment is that?

17:23.921 --> 17:25.681
Do I talk about priests
who can't get married

17:25.761 --> 17:27.961
and get off on children?

17:28.681 --> 17:29.721
No?

17:30.441 --> 17:32.321
Why? I never talk to you about that.

17:33.441 --> 17:35.081
Because I respect other cultures.

17:35.161 --> 17:36.201
All right, calm down.

17:36.281 --> 17:40.201
I was just saying that Muslim women
are more into housework.

17:41.801 --> 17:42.841
Yeah?

17:43.401 --> 17:44.441
And right now,

17:44.801 --> 17:47.961
who is looking after your kids
while you're making racist comments?

17:50.921 --> 17:51.921
A woman!

17:52.721 --> 17:53.961
A cop, but a woman.

18:02.761 --> 18:03.761
So?

18:04.121 --> 18:06.281
The laundrette's entrance
is being guarded.

18:06.681 --> 18:10.201
The only guys who can come in are
Turkish couriers with bags full of cash.

18:10.281 --> 18:13.321
We won't have set a foot inside
before the alert goes out.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.401
Tell me something, Walter.

18:16.081 --> 18:18.481
You're not implying we will
need a woman, are you?

18:21.521 --> 18:23.121
Did I miss something?

18:32.521 --> 18:35.961
HERE LIES
THE CAPLAN FAMILY

19:08.601 --> 19:10.241
What do you want, Caplan?

19:10.601 --> 19:12.761
I need Lieutenant Delgado
for an operation.

19:13.401 --> 19:15.441
Lieutenant Delgado works with Bernardi.

19:15.681 --> 19:17.561
Originally, the lieutenant
was part of my group.

19:17.641 --> 19:19.361
Your group is under investigation,

19:19.441 --> 19:20.961
Caplan, do I have to remind you?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.961
Your latest exploits won't stop it.

19:24.041 --> 19:26.281
I will lead this investigation
until the end.

19:26.361 --> 19:28.721
I have the means to infiltrate
the Turkish network

19:28.801 --> 19:30.401
but for that I really need her.

19:31.681 --> 19:33.161
So, yes or no?

19:36.721 --> 19:38.521
- How long?
- Forty-eight hours.

19:43.001 --> 19:44.481
It's a yes.

19:45.441 --> 19:47.121
Don't forget, Caplan.

19:47.201 --> 19:50.601
We are not here to right wrongs
but to get results.

19:50.921 --> 19:54.161
You by arresting gangsters
and me by taking down crooks.

20:06.321 --> 20:07.321
Hello?

20:08.361 --> 20:09.361
Hi, Eddy.

20:12.801 --> 20:13.801
Okay.

20:14.841 --> 20:16.321
Yes, I wanted to thank you

20:17.761 --> 20:19.041
for the mobile

20:19.961 --> 20:21.601
and the clothes and the money.

20:24.241 --> 20:25.601
It's okay, don't worry.

20:26.281 --> 20:27.561
Okay, bye.

20:29.361 --> 20:31.721
I know a good spot to eat in Paris.

20:33.881 --> 20:35.761
You are the one driving, Roxanne.

20:40.481 --> 20:44.161
Looks like the Cyber Cafe
and the laundrette meet in the back.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.601
- Is that where they count the notes?
- Yeah.

20:49.601 --> 20:51.161
I know the neighbourhood well.

20:51.241 --> 20:53.721
With your cop faces,
you'll get noticed quickly.

20:54.121 --> 20:56.441
- We'll have to play it smart on this one.
- Okay.

20:56.561 --> 20:59.641
We absolutely need Roxanne in this.
Wassim, you deal with that.

21:00.161 --> 21:02.521
We need to be ready for
when it opens tomorrow.

21:02.601 --> 21:03.881
Okay.

21:10.001 --> 21:11.001
Thank you.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.961
Do you like it?

21:17.281 --> 21:19.161
What are you doing here, Roxanne?

21:23.001 --> 21:25.281
When I spoke to Eddy
on the phone earlier,

21:25.761 --> 21:27.401
he didn't mention you.

21:27.481 --> 21:29.241
I could tell you were uncomfortable.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.161
All right, you caught me.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.481
Okay, why are you here, Roxanne?

21:36.561 --> 21:38.481
I wanted to know what
Eddy was hiding from me.

21:41.721 --> 21:43.641
Are you the one that Vogel nearly killed?

21:51.041 --> 21:53.161
I'm happy to have helped you out.

22:00.841 --> 22:01.841
Thank you.

22:21.681 --> 22:22.681
Nathan?

22:42.721 --> 22:44.361
Have you changed your mind?
Are you moving in?

22:44.441 --> 22:46.521
No, I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

22:47.041 --> 22:49.321
We can eat together if you want,
I'll make something.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.321
Okay.

23:04.001 --> 23:05.401
Do you need help?

23:05.481 --> 23:06.481
No, I'm okay.

23:35.361 --> 23:37.001
Shall we go in?

23:43.881 --> 23:46.481
When it comes to food,
you take after our mother.

23:46.561 --> 23:48.561
As much from Myriam as from Mum.

23:54.721 --> 23:56.241
Did you go and see them today?

23:56.321 --> 23:57.321
Yes.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.201
Do you want some?

23:59.281 --> 24:01.241
- Yes.
- I went to the cemetery.

24:02.401 --> 24:04.721
How did you go? It's quite a way.

24:06.001 --> 24:09.201
After 15 years in prison,
a few miles' walk is a blessing.

24:15.521 --> 24:16.921
Have you got any plans?

24:17.001 --> 24:18.241
Find work.

24:19.481 --> 24:21.801
I won't have rent but I'll have bills
and I want to pay them.

24:21.881 --> 24:23.241
Don't worry about that.

24:23.841 --> 24:25.601
I don't want your help, Eddy.

24:25.681 --> 24:26.681
Nor your pity.

24:27.241 --> 24:29.281
I used to have a job,
I'll find another one.

24:29.361 --> 24:31.081
I need to be persistent.

24:31.161 --> 24:33.281
I'm not treating you like a charity case.

24:34.361 --> 24:37.121
Dad left some money for you
as well as the apartment.

24:37.441 --> 24:39.681
That'll buy you time until you find a job.

24:39.761 --> 24:41.201
Stop that, Eddy, stop that.

24:41.921 --> 24:44.081
I know Dad was broke when he died.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.401
He paid for my lawyer.

24:49.441 --> 24:51.481
He was using his retirement money.

24:53.441 --> 24:55.761
At the end of their lives, all they had left

24:56.241 --> 24:57.841
was this apartment.

25:01.361 --> 25:04.921
I also know you disowned me
because I broke their heart.

25:10.961 --> 25:12.521
It's not what I wanted, Eddy,

25:15.281 --> 25:16.881
but I was in too much pain.

25:19.281 --> 25:20.881
That guy had to die.

25:23.161 --> 25:24.801
I had to kill him.

25:31.241 --> 25:33.121
I know, Nathan, I know.

26:03.801 --> 26:07.041
Thanks for accompanying me
on my first day as a free man.

26:07.121 --> 26:09.521
See you soon.

26:14.001 --> 26:16.721
You're welcome. See you soon.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.441
Wassim, it's me.

26:40.801 --> 26:42.281
I'm listening, Caplan.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.561
<i>The laundrette has just opened.
You can go.</i>

26:46.041 --> 26:47.041
Okay.

26:48.161 --> 26:50.201
- Are you ready?
- Whenever you are.

27:58.801 --> 28:01.001
What the hell are the Turks doing?

28:28.361 --> 28:29.481
I don't understand.

28:46.161 --> 28:47.161
Here they are.

29:21.041 --> 29:22.481
Let's go.

30:02.121 --> 30:03.121
Sir?

30:04.721 --> 30:05.881
What's going on?

30:05.961 --> 30:08.001
Hi, do you know whose Merc this is?

30:08.921 --> 30:10.281
Go away. Piss off.

30:10.361 --> 30:12.361
Sir, I'm talking to you.

30:13.321 --> 30:15.401
Is the vehicle right outside yours?

30:15.481 --> 30:17.321
It's been five minutes
and you're already breaking my balls.

30:17.401 --> 30:21.001
Wow, calm down! I'm talking to
you politely, so do the same.

30:21.441 --> 30:22.681
I'll talk however I want, get it?

30:22.801 --> 30:24.801
Cousin, cousin, stop!

30:25.921 --> 30:27.641
What more does he want?

30:28.201 --> 30:31.481
- What's going on?
- Give me your hand and shut up.

30:33.281 --> 30:34.361
Sit down.

30:38.961 --> 30:40.761
Police! Calm down!

30:41.081 --> 30:42.441
Don't panic, ladies, don't panic.

30:47.681 --> 30:48.841
Eddy, we're doing good here.

30:48.921 --> 30:50.321
Okay, see you in the backyard.

31:16.641 --> 31:17.641
It's me.

31:17.721 --> 31:20.161
Your car is double-parked,
the police are here.

31:20.721 --> 31:21.761
Who are you?

31:22.601 --> 31:23.601
Open quick!

31:23.681 --> 31:24.681
Go away.

32:08.641 --> 32:10.201
You. Go!

32:16.121 --> 32:17.121
Here.

32:18.121 --> 32:20.121
Tell your boss to call this number.

32:20.561 --> 32:21.761
It's in his interests.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.681
Take him outside.

32:23.801 --> 32:24.801
Move.

32:24.881 --> 32:26.521
I'll see you later, as planned.

32:36.681 --> 32:37.721
Here he is.

32:42.121 --> 32:44.681
That looks like a smoothly handled
operation, Major Caplan.

32:45.561 --> 32:47.521
Here, the dirty money book.

32:50.441 --> 32:53.721
Lieutenant Delgado, you're back with
Superintendent Bernardi tomorrow.

32:54.641 --> 32:57.401
I'm sure you'll be just as efficient
as you were today.

33:01.961 --> 33:03.921
What a big fucking arsehole, that one.

33:04.721 --> 33:05.721
You're right.

33:11.481 --> 33:12.481
Hello?

33:16.401 --> 33:17.401
Okay.

33:26.121 --> 33:28.081
Do you think this meet-up is a trap?

33:30.481 --> 33:31.761
We shall see.

33:56.241 --> 33:57.881
We're giving them five minutes.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.761
Hello, I'm listening.

34:17.841 --> 34:19.121
<i>Major Caplan?</i>

34:19.201 --> 34:20.400
Who's this?

34:20.481 --> 34:22.360
<i>My name is Fatin Imrali.</i>

34:22.440 --> 34:24.521
<i>I work for the man
you are causing damage to.</i>

34:25.400 --> 34:27.601
- Is your boss Baba Aroudj?
- <i>No.</i>

34:27.681 --> 34:30.081
<i>Baba Aroudj and I only have
one thing in common,</i>

34:30.721 --> 34:31.721
<i>the same boss.</i>

34:32.960 --> 34:33.960
Okay, Mr Imrali.

34:35.081 --> 34:36.321
I want Baba Aroudj

34:36.481 --> 34:39.241
and I want him relieved from
his diplomatic immunity.

34:39.321 --> 34:41.561
Or I'll keep on taking
your business apart.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.521
<i>Baba Aroudj is in Marseille.</i>

34:44.481 --> 34:46.041
<i>Come get him, we'll give him to you.</i>

34:46.641 --> 34:47.641
Where in Marseille?

34:47.801 --> 34:50.041
<i>I'll text you an address and time.</i>

35:40.681 --> 35:42.681
Wake up, Walter, we're here.

35:48.961 --> 35:49.961
Hey.

36:01.041 --> 36:03.681
Please! My friends, please.

36:04.481 --> 36:05.481
Jackie.

36:10.561 --> 36:11.641
Jackie, my great love.

36:12.801 --> 36:15.761
Thank you for the 30 years of love
you've given me.

36:19.601 --> 36:20.601
Bravo!

36:32.961 --> 36:34.401
I'll be back.

36:39.761 --> 36:41.321
Mr Councillor.

36:41.401 --> 36:42.761
Major.

36:42.841 --> 36:44.161
Could you tell me what you're doing?

36:44.241 --> 36:46.121
We're working, Councillor,
we're working.

36:46.201 --> 36:48.361
What brings you to Serge Greiner's?

36:49.081 --> 36:50.921
Mr Greiner is a friend
of the councils' president

36:51.161 --> 36:53.521
and we are here to celebrate
his wedding anniversary.

36:54.401 --> 36:57.801
This is a warrant
that allows me to arrest Serge Greiner.

36:58.801 --> 37:01.521
Which I'm going to do, Mr Councillor.
The party is over.

37:03.281 --> 37:07.121
I hope you'll be courteous enough
to let the president leave first.

37:07.201 --> 37:08.601
We're giving you a minute.

37:08.681 --> 37:11.161
Fifty-nine, 58, 57,

37:11.761 --> 37:13.001
56,

37:13.321 --> 37:14.321
55,

37:14.761 --> 37:15.881
3, 2, 1...

37:22.161 --> 37:24.201
Ladies, gentlemen. Hello.

37:25.801 --> 37:31.641
Mr Serge Greiner, you're being held
in custody from 12:02 p.m. for 48 hours,

37:31.721 --> 37:33.361
which could be extended
by another 48 hours.

37:33.441 --> 37:35.841
You're suspected to have taken part
in a hold-up

37:35.921 --> 37:40.201
and various murders in 2005.
A doctor may examine you

37:40.521 --> 37:43.561
and you're allowed
to call a family member.

37:43.841 --> 37:47.441
You will be assisted by a lawyer
if you wish during the procedure.

37:48.281 --> 37:49.281
Call Mr Kalbache.

37:50.121 --> 37:51.161
Any questions?

37:53.041 --> 37:56.601
- No, Drobecq, those go in front.
- Sure, boss.

37:56.681 --> 37:59.321
Everything is okay, honey,
it must be a mistake.

37:59.761 --> 38:02.401
Yeah, no doubt, madam. Let's go.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.521
- Hi.
- Hi, Fatin.

38:23.321 --> 38:25.241
You can go, I'll take it from here.

38:25.321 --> 38:27.201
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry.

38:27.281 --> 38:28.281
At your service.

39:48.681 --> 39:50.721
- Cigarette?
- Thank you, I've quit.

39:54.961 --> 39:57.961
Aubagne, 2005. Four deaths.

39:58.601 --> 40:00.681
Loot, 7.5 million Euros.

40:01.521 --> 40:03.921
Security guards killed
at point-blank range.

40:04.001 --> 40:06.801
That's not a hold-up, that's a massacre.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.521
This is a matter we won't let go.

40:11.161 --> 40:13.521
Do you know what the bulldozer
technique is, Mr Greiner?

40:13.841 --> 40:15.361
I don't understand cop lingo.

40:22.201 --> 40:23.721
It's quite simple.

40:23.801 --> 40:26.281
At a crime scene,
we collect and list everything.

40:27.241 --> 40:29.121
That's the bulldozer technique.

40:29.841 --> 40:32.801
About 50 metres down the road
from where the hold-up happened,

40:32.881 --> 40:35.561
forensics found a balaclava.

40:37.361 --> 40:38.921
They sealed it up.

40:40.281 --> 40:44.041
You wouldn't believe the progress
DNA research has made in 10 years.

40:45.361 --> 40:47.001
I'll cut to the chase.

40:47.641 --> 40:50.201
This balaclava is full of your DNA.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.441
Some colleagues found cigarette butts,

40:54.241 --> 40:56.521
just where the robbers
were waiting for the security guards.

40:57.801 --> 41:00.041
On those butts we also found your DNA.

41:01.401 --> 41:04.121
You should have stopped
smoking 10 years ago, Greiner.

41:04.641 --> 41:06.001
I want to see my lawyer.

41:07.281 --> 41:08.601
He won't be long.

41:08.681 --> 41:10.841
- Major?
- What's going on?

41:14.081 --> 41:15.841
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

41:17.721 --> 41:19.481
The guy who had lunch with Mandeville.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.881
It's Sedat Baba Aroudj,
a Turkish bigshot.

41:22.201 --> 41:23.521
But we can't get anywhere near him.

41:23.601 --> 41:25.841
- Why not?
- Diplomatic immunity.

41:25.921 --> 41:27.041
What a pain!

41:27.121 --> 41:29.601
We have a team on his case 24/7
but nothing so far.

41:29.681 --> 41:32.401
He only comes out of his hotel
to go have lunch in town.

41:32.721 --> 41:33.721
Don't lose sight of him.

41:34.281 --> 41:35.281
I won't.

41:36.041 --> 41:37.441
How is it going with him?

41:37.521 --> 41:38.521
Him...

41:39.761 --> 41:41.121
He knows he's going down.

41:41.961 --> 41:44.281
I just don't know
how far down he's willing to go.

42:02.241 --> 42:03.241
Fatin Imrali?

42:03.601 --> 42:04.601
Himself.

42:05.321 --> 42:06.321
Where is Aroudj?

42:06.761 --> 42:07.761
In his room.

42:07.881 --> 42:10.561
Good. Call him,
he'll come out and we'll take him.

42:10.641 --> 42:12.841
It's not going to happen like that,

42:12.921 --> 42:13.961
Major Caplan.

42:14.761 --> 42:19.241
My boss doesn't like the idea of an
arrest and detention for Baba Aroudj.

42:19.721 --> 42:22.081
It would be a disgrace
for our organisation

42:22.161 --> 42:25.441
and it would hurt our credibility
with our partners.

42:26.561 --> 42:29.841
My boss has decided to send
Baba Aroudj back to Istanbul,

42:29.921 --> 42:32.361
where he will be
withdrawn from the business.

42:32.441 --> 42:34.081
In a way,

42:34.161 --> 42:35.161
dismissed.

42:35.281 --> 42:38.801
This pig attacks my kids in my house
and as a punishment, you dismiss him.

42:40.161 --> 42:42.721
Do you think we came
to Marseille to get fucked about?

42:43.841 --> 42:45.841
As far as I know, Lieutenant Morlighem,

42:46.681 --> 42:47.881
your kids aren't dead.

42:48.481 --> 42:50.121
No! Put your gun down.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.921
Put your gun down!

42:52.001 --> 42:53.201
Imrali, tell him!

42:53.281 --> 42:54.441
Go on, shithead!

42:54.521 --> 42:55.521
Down.

42:56.441 --> 42:57.441
Give it to me.

42:58.961 --> 43:01.081
That fucker
messed with my family, Eddy.

43:01.161 --> 43:02.961
Do you think I'm going to let him
go back to his country?

43:04.241 --> 43:05.761
What are you doing, Walter?

43:07.201 --> 43:09.721
Okay, we're going back to the car now.
Move.

43:09.801 --> 43:10.801
Walter!

43:10.961 --> 43:13.761
Get in, quick! You're driving.
Walter, where are you going?

43:13.841 --> 43:15.521
Walter! Hurry!

43:15.761 --> 43:17.521
Get in! Walter, come back!

43:17.601 --> 43:21.441
Go on! Get in!
Hands on the steering wheel!

43:22.641 --> 43:24.121
Walter, wait!

43:25.641 --> 43:27.401
Mr Aroudj's room, with the pass.

43:27.961 --> 43:29.201
Room 112.

43:29.281 --> 43:31.081
- The pass!
- Walter!

43:32.801 --> 43:33.801
It's over there.

44:14.001 --> 44:16.161
Alright? Have you finished yet?

44:16.241 --> 44:17.361
White filth!

44:18.281 --> 44:19.281
No respect.

44:22.121 --> 44:24.241
Because you know
what respect is, you pig!

44:24.321 --> 44:26.201
You attack children.
