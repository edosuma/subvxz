WEBVTT

01:43.812 --> 01:48.055
This magnificent castle is
now officially a crime scene.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.524
90 extremely rare and highly
valuable diamonds that have

01:51.612 --> 01:54.695
been in the hurst family for
generations have been stolen

01:54.781 --> 01:58.239
from this high security
tower right here behind me.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.535
Police are appealing for any
information that could lead towards

02:01.622 --> 02:04.238
the arrest of these criminals
or criminal involved

02:04.333 --> 02:05.413
in this despicable crime.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.201
Lady hurst was unavailable
for comment,

02:09.295 --> 02:12.083
but those close to her
say that she is devastated

02:12.174 --> 02:14.711
by the loss of these gems
that were handed down

02:14.801 --> 02:17.008
to her as a child
by her late mother.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.235
Are your arms broken? =no.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.945
Are your legs broken?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
No.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.037
Are you alive?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.537
Yes.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.709
Then let's go.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.128
Somehow daddy was always

02:53.215 --> 02:55.706
there to pick us up
and dust us off.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.883
It wasn't always like this.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.210
Let me give you some context.

03:00.305 --> 03:03.263
It was that summer when the
green turned to golden brown.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.810
We actually live in Glen close.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.105
It's the same name as some
American movie actress,

03:12.192 --> 03:13.682
apparently quite talented.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.315
We've won the lottery of life,
dad says.

03:18.073 --> 03:22.112
He says there are people
starving, no water in the tap,

03:22.202 --> 03:25.535
let alone england's greenest
hills and beautiful views.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.658
There's a saying, "you've don't

03:27.749 --> 03:29.580
know what you've got
till it's gone.”

03:29.668 --> 03:32.330
Well, I was soon going to
understand what that meant.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.962
You don't know me yet,
but my name is Sam.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.624
This is my brother, Jake.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.051
Cute, they all say.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.719
These guys are
the reasons our parents

03:42.806 --> 03:46.469
invented neighborhood
watch, dodgy.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.097
This guy, I've got a four
letter word for him.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.678
Actually, it's five letters.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.513
I was never that
good at spelling.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.099
We'll come back to them.
You yell if you see them around.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.815
Tnis is my mom,

03:58.905 --> 04:00.111
that's my school.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.197
My mom is the sensible one.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.533
I'nat's a good quality
for a mommy.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.906
Daddy, however,
is a bit different.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.704
He's a speedway racer.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.121
Mommy thinks he should stop,
but he loves it too much.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.379
You know, these speedway
bikes don't even have brakes.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.166
Tne only breaks are
your bones, mom says.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.513
He used to be a champ,

04:31.605 --> 04:34.187
but that was long before
we came along.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.730
It's been so long
since he's won,

04:35.817 --> 04:37.682
his trophies are gathering dust.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.353
Something happened
with mommy and daddy.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.439
I don't know what exactly,
but grownups are funny.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.367
Everything is a military
operation to him.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.820
He even cuts the hedge
like he's on a mission.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.496
He has a machine in the garage,

04:51.583 --> 04:54.199
but he insists on using
these big green scissors.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.870
He treats everything as exercise
and a test of precision.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.339
He's got this crazy
American car.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.920
He loves that car.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.631
Mom says he loves it
more than her.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.183
Dad seems obsessed with America.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.680
He met mom there and they drove

05:13.772 --> 05:15.683
around America
in this big old car.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.270
Apparently, I was made
in the back seat or something,

05:19.361 --> 05:21.317
but I really don't want
fo talk about that.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.191
Apparently it's the exact
car that was used

05:24.282 --> 05:28.150
in some American movie, staring
clive eastman or something,

05:28.245 --> 05:30.156
put I can't quite
remember its hame.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.664
It's Clint, Clint Eastwood,

05:34.751 --> 05:37.083
and he's the finest movie
star who ever lived.

05:37.963 --> 05:41.171
And because of his movies,
he'll always live.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.591
It's so precious,
he won't even drive it.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.045
He's a bit of a joker.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.678
He used to set traps with
string and stuff like that.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.269
- Seriously?
- Hmm.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.027
One Halloween,
he pulled this gag.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.979
Why don't we go to the park?

06:11.454 --> 06:14.287
Oh, Jake, I'm sorry.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.040
It's just a silly mask, okay?

06:19.087 --> 06:21.203
Just a silly mask.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.298
I'm so sorry.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.043
Jake cried for hours.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.129
That morning before
it all happened,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.085
a bird circled the house.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.721
I should have known
it was a sign.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.349
Apparently these signs
are everywhere,

06:36.313 --> 06:38.099
if only we knew where to look.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.893
So, mom's off back to America.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.599
Oh, bye, boys.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.313
- You be good for daddy, okay?
- Okay.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.303
This is the moment daddy
should have stopped

06:50.327 --> 06:53.034
mommy leaving, but he didn't.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.861
I love you guys.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.601
Come on. - They
think we don't notice

06:56.625 --> 06:58.866
the looks they give
each other behind our backs,

06:58.960 --> 06:59.995
but we do.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.380
I've become something
of a lip reading expert.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.708
A skill I had no ambition
to acquire,

07:08.386 --> 07:10.146
put it was going to
prove more of a lifesaver

07:10.180 --> 07:12.011
than I ever could have imagined.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.475
So, it's dad's big race
in less than a week.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.723
Mom normally does
all the kid stuff,

07:19.814 --> 07:21.645
so she thinks leaving
us with him

07:21.733 --> 07:23.849
will stop dad practicing
for his race.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.485
But I don't think she knows
that man as well as she thinks.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.772
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:30.867 --> 07:33.404
good afternoon and welcome
to Arlington stadium.

07:34.496 --> 07:38.739
An afternoon of fun,
thrills and speedway.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.957
But of course, we have to
welcome our resident champion,

07:44.047 --> 07:46.959
the one and only Kevin Jenkins!

07:52.097 --> 07:53.977
Everyone loved
this new champ, but I think

07:54.015 --> 07:56.506
he loved himself
just a little too much.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.599
Come on. Come on!

08:46.401 --> 08:48.733
And as usual, he won again.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.840
Dad says it's just
about the taking part.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.826
But I could see something
was breaking his heart.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.876
Shouldn't you be at home
changing diapers

09:14.971 --> 09:16.427
or whatever it is daddies do?

09:17.515 --> 09:18.800
I came second, didn't I?

09:19.934 --> 09:22.175
You think second
is winning, huh?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.555
What is your problem?

09:24.606 --> 09:25.891
It's a young man's game.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.525
Go and do something
important, daddy.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.827
My dad used to have sponsors.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.246
There was interviews
on TV and everything,

09:43.333 --> 09:44.994
but guess who gets all that now?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.746
Look at all of these landscapes,

09:46.836 --> 09:49.953
and America is so huge,
you know, england would fit

09:50.048 --> 09:53.336
into one of these states
and there are 50 of them.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.382
Can you imagine
the biking we could do?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.012
You know that man
at the stadium?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.100
Yeah.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.551
Why was he being mean to you?

10:04.646 --> 10:05.686
Ah, don't worry about him.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.563
Some people are just like that.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.647
Why didn't you do anything?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.271
Like what, hit him?

10:12.362 --> 10:13.522
Mm.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.401
You can't just go around
hitting people.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.817
Violence is almost
never the answer,

10:20.912 --> 10:23.449
unless we're talking
about an absolute bully.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.202
Are you allowed to hit a bully?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.249
Well, not officially.

10:29.337 --> 10:33.376
I mean... don't tell
your mom I ever said this,

10:33.466 --> 10:35.331
definitely don't tell
any teachers,

10:35.426 --> 10:37.417
but if there's a really
nasty piece of work

10:37.512 --> 10:39.844
and you've tried
everything else,

10:39.931 --> 10:41.796
there's really only
one way to stop them.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.723
But you have to do it right.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.811
Tell us.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.607
Right there,
straight on those nose

10:52.735 --> 10:54.396
with everything you've got.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.897
It doesn't matter
how big you are,

10:56.698 --> 10:58.484
a whack to the nose
and you're down.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.403
But I didn't tell you that.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.155
Goodnight, boys.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.291
Come on, it's the finals, Lucy,

11:14.382 --> 11:15.382
you know that.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.087
But it's so dangerous.

11:21.806 --> 11:22.806
I miss you.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.549
Same here, okay?

11:26.311 --> 11:30.020
I miss you, too,
but I need to race on Saturday.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.392
It's what I've been
building up to.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.519
Besides, it's good for the boys

11:34.611 --> 11:36.727
to see some healthy competition.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.857
Healthy?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.360
It's noisy and it stinks!

11:42.869 --> 11:45.986
Michael, you put
your life on the line

11:46.080 --> 11:47.991
every time
you get on that thing.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.709
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not 25 anymore.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.161
I know.

11:55.256 --> 12:00.376
You're a father, you need
to start acting responsibly.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.343
How would those boys
feel if the last thing

12:06.434 --> 12:09.801
they saw of you
was a pile of dust?

12:15.485 --> 12:16.975
What else do I do, Lucy?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.144
What else am I good at?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.606
I'm not even sure
how good I am at that anymore.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.575
== - Sam's up, I've got to go.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.538
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.257
We were still getting out

12:45.348 --> 12:46.348
and about on our bikes.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.510
Until one day we discovered
something much better.

12:54.774 --> 13:01.316
Something new, something safer,
something easy to control.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.574
We wouldn't even need
mom and dad to pick us up

13:06.661 --> 13:08.572
or dust us off.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.085
What are you doing?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.207
Playing tennis.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.039
And what are you doing?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.134
Playing football.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.565
No, you're not,
your arms are not swinging,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.343
your legs are not moving.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.012
Let's go outside,
play some ball.

13:48.870 --> 13:49.950
Are you angry?

13:51.122 --> 13:55.035
Look, I can play a boxing
game and it's fun,

13:55.126 --> 13:56.787
put there's nothing like

13:56.878 --> 13:58.618
actually punching that bag.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.920
The feeling in your lungs,
the exertion.

14:01.007 --> 14:05.216
Look, Sam, those devices,
they're amazing.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.423
They've changed the world forever, the
people that have made them are geniuses,

14:08.514 --> 14:11.347
but those geniuses did not
expect the children of today

14:11.434 --> 14:13.595
to be sat there all day
staring into them.

14:14.312 --> 14:19.807
Listen to me, you can
play 1,000 motorbike games

14:19.942 --> 14:22.524
with your fingers, but you'll
never get the same feeling

14:22.612 --> 14:25.979
as when you get on that bike,
you feel that engine roar,

14:26.074 --> 14:28.611
that air is your lungs,
dirt in your face.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.532
That 1s adventure.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.239
It's exercise.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.785
And when I'm gone, I do not
want you boys just sat staring

14:36.876 --> 14:38.958
into those screens
for the rest of your life.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.588
Come here.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.338
You want to punch the bag?

14:44.425 --> 14:45.255
Mm-hmm.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.753
All right, punch the bag.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.129
Okay, you want
to punch really hard?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.589
You don't punch the bag.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.267
Look at me, you punch
through the bag.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.183
We didn't realize
at that moment,

15:03.277 --> 15:06.110
what we were about to learn
would soon be used in a life

15:06.197 --> 15:07.312
or death situation.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.619
That's it, come on.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.697
Let's get this going.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.034
Okay, boys, what is this?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.711
A ball.

15:23.798 --> 15:27.006
It's not a ball, it's a
device to train your accuracy.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.583
If you can catch
a ball at high speed,

15:28.678 --> 15:30.669
you can anticipate
a turn, a bump,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.674
you can react
at lightning speed.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.676
Jake, you're up.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.455
Yes!

16:02.253 --> 16:03.613
Then the real training began.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.622
So, what do you want to eat?

16:41.709 --> 16:42.824
Sweets. Chocolate.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.409
Come with me.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.461
To dad, this was
his worst nightmare.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.924
One day we might not do
anything for real.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.552
In his eyes, something
drastic had to be done.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.317
Look at all this,
this is energy food.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.609
Look at all the colors.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.068
Nature has made all these
amazing things for us.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.117
Here, do you know how many trees
you can climb on one of these?

17:18.204 --> 17:21.412
How many? - I don't know
exactly, but a lot more than you can

17:21.499 --> 17:23.035
on sweets and chocolate, okay?

17:26.503 --> 17:28.494
Okay, boys, what is this?

17:28.589 --> 17:31.171
- A piece of paper.
- Wrong again.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.590
Everything is what you make it.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.503
This is good exercise,
this is running in fields,

17:36.597 --> 17:40.055
this is air in your lungs,
but you have to make it so.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.957
You just never know where a little
piece of paper can take you.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.322
At first, it was just me,

18:02.582 --> 18:06.245
then my best friend, then three,

18:08.254 --> 18:09.494
then the whole class.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.712
Even the girls joined in.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.188
And then, there she was.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.113
I should've said something.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.372
But I wasn't brave enough.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.170
Not yet.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.802
And when Christopher
Columbus was sailing

19:03.893 --> 19:08.182
those seven seas,
he experienced things

19:08.272 --> 19:10.934
that others could
only dream about.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.233
Your next topic, I want you all

19:14.320 --> 19:17.357
to think wisely about Columbus.

19:17.448 --> 19:21.407
How was he feeling when
just he had discovered

19:21.494 --> 19:25.328
such a magnificent
and beautiful sight?

19:27.291 --> 19:31.125
And master Samuel Harris,
if you spent just a little more

19:31.212 --> 19:34.545
time looking at your school
book than you do at Amelie,

19:34.632 --> 19:36.338
you might just pass
with flying colors.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.896
Uh... uh... um.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.144
Everything is what you make it.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.650
You have to make it so.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.357
Uh, do you want to come
to the races on Saturday?

20:06.580 --> 20:07.580
No!

20:09.959 --> 20:12.041
Okay.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.538
Of
Course, I did that in private.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.673
Somehow, my heart was beating

20:27.768 --> 20:31.056
faster than ever at dad's after
school practice.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.413
- Hello, mommy.
- Hey, boys.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.993
- Hello, mommy.
- How are you?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.441
We've been flying
paper airplanes...

20:57.465 --> 20:58.505
We've been going on

20:58.549 --> 20:59.789
bike rides in the fields.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.545
We've been flying
through the air.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.842
Daddy through the ball and... I

21:03.929 --> 21:05.574
- I caught it, and then we...
- Paper airplanes.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.213
Went to the field
and I did epic jumps.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.180
We went over the ramp
with the scooter...

21:09.268 --> 21:11.621
- We did bmxing through...
- We climbed the frame

21:11.645 --> 21:12.725
loads of times. Uh, huh.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.020
- And it was really fun.
- Uh, huh.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.229
And also, this girl, Amelie.
=uh, huh.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.773
I asked her out
to daddy's race on Saturday.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.695
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.740
Mommy misses you.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.196
We miss you too, mommy.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.739
We're going on a bike ride now.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.937
- Bye, mommy.
- Going to go on a bike ride now.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.326
- Bye, mom.
- I love you, boys.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.752
Love you too, mom.

21:39.882 --> 21:40.882
You be careful.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.586
Bye, mom.

21:58.526 --> 22:01.142
Bye, daddy,
we're off to practice.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.898
Oh, well, bye, boys.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.444
Bye, daddy.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.897
Be careful.

22:50.286 --> 22:53.995
"Beyond the dark winamill,
two swallows hold the key."

22:55.708 --> 22:58.040
Let's just leave it,
it's not meant for us.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.079
Wait, the dark windmill,

23:00.170 --> 23:02.536
that's the other side
of the downs.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.496
Yeah, but that's miles away.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.628
Come on, let's investigate it.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.539
Two swallows hold the key.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.944
Look, over there!

24:41.480 --> 24:44.222
"B13, midnight sparkles.”

24:44.316 --> 24:46.523
B for books?

24:46.610 --> 24:47.895
B for bad idea.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.602
Come on, let's go back.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.156
Wait.

24:53.617 --> 24:59.328
B13, b13, there are 14
bunkers or kneecap hill.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.958
Remember, we went on a walk
there with mom and dad.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.956
That's miles away.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.628
It's going to be
getting dark soon.

25:13.387 --> 25:16.049
Remember, dad said we should be
having adventures.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.926
Look, we've got a key,
let's at least investigate.

25:47.671 --> 25:48.671
There's 12.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.006
There, 13 this must be it.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.805
Look, there's something inside.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.761
Oh, yeah, what is that?

26:27.544 --> 26:29.830
Come on, boys.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.501
No!

27:17.136 --> 27:18.626
That can't be right.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.213
It's hours until midnight.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.473
L

27:29.606 --> 27:32.063
There's someone in there.
You what?

27:32.151 --> 27:33.482
Wow, diamonds.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.068
Do you think they're real?

27:36.155 --> 27:37.645
Well, how about we find out?

27:43.287 --> 27:44.287
Are you sure?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.910
Movement. =I don't know.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.750
Oil -

27:55.841 --> 27:56.841
oi!

28:03.432 --> 28:04.432
Come on.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.553
Gee!

28:12.316 --> 28:13.556
What the...

28:22.701 --> 28:24.783
It's empty. =no.

28:27.873 --> 28:28.988
That's not possible.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.242
Not without the key.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.414
How have they got the key?

28:33.212 --> 28:35.248
Are you okay?

28:35.339 --> 28:37.796
Just, go get them!

28:40.677 --> 28:41.883
Quick, they're coming.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.891
Ah, where they gone?

28:55.025 --> 28:56.140
Hang on.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.768
Catch.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.451
- Right.
- Go, go, go.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.582
Eh?

29:19.216 --> 29:21.332
That way. =t here.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.210
Quick, now go.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.850
What? Hey.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.223
There he is, come here.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.026
Run, Reynolds, run!

29:41.113 --> 29:42.944
All right, come here.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.896
Quick, come on, come on.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.357
Power it, power it!

29:49.162 --> 29:50.390
- Come here!
- Get the other one,

29:50.414 --> 29:52.405
get the other one.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.627
Freeze!

30:06.179 --> 30:07.385
Come on!

30:08.390 --> 30:09.971
Theyre getting away.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.476
Down here.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.279
Right.

30:46.970 --> 30:47.970
We've lost them.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.355
Hello, daddy.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.317
Hello, daddy. -
Hey, boys, wait a second.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.190
Boys, I was worried about you.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.281
You've been ages.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.200
Are you okay?

31:11.203 --> 31:13.194
I was thinking, you know,
if you want to have a go

31:13.288 --> 31:15.199
at the goggle-pad,
it's okay with me.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.908
Maybe like, uh, ten minute
slots or something?

31:19.002 --> 31:20.117
Boss is going to kill us.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.248
How did they find them?

31:23.298 --> 31:24.629
Maybe the note that blew away?

31:24.716 --> 31:25.922
What?

31:27.344 --> 31:29.585
I was halfway through writing
the note for the exchange,

31:29.679 --> 31:33.547
and I wanted to be outside,
you know, around the bloom.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.266
Flowers are amazing
at this time of year.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.394
1 didn't want to miss out.

31:39.981 --> 31:43.144
And the wind picked up
and blew it away.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.143
I tried to grab it,
but it was gone.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.158
1 thought it got stuck
in a bush somewhere, so...

31:49.408 --> 31:50.408
I wrote another.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.159
Great.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.984
You're meant to be the fastest,
you couldn't even grab them.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.529
Well, it wasn't my idea to hide the
diamonds in the first place, was it?

32:09.553 --> 32:12.215
Well, if it wasn't for me, we
wouldn't have even spotted the kids.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.117
You were
the one that lost that note.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.881
That note was a stupid idea.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.457
Do you know, I never
wanted to be a criminal anyway.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.135
I wanted to be a gardener.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.393
I wanted to have a plot of land,
some tulips and some grass.

32:24.067 --> 32:30.154
Yeah, but my mom saidq,
"you haven't got green fingers.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.525
You've got sticky fingers."

32:31.616 --> 32:33.072
=shut...

32:33.743 --> 32:34.778
Up.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.362
Look at these things,
they could be worth a fortune.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.257
What do you think
we should do with the money?

32:43.462 --> 32:46.920
Right now those two little boys

32:47.007 --> 32:50.215
are making fools of both of you.

32:51.595 --> 32:52.926
Buy a helicopter.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.213
Or even better, a private jet.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.935
We could help the poor people
daddy tells us about.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.820
With your share
of the profit, hmm?

33:17.662 --> 33:21.780
You could buy a patch of
land that you could tend

33:21.875 --> 33:24.617
for the remainder
of your living days.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.627
What do you think mommy
and daddy would want?

33:28.423 --> 33:31.165
A trip to America,
no doubt about it.

33:33.261 --> 33:37.174
But without it,
the only digging will be

33:37.265 --> 33:40.473
that of two shallow graves.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.682
One the size of your body.

33:47.901 --> 33:50.563
And one half the size
of your body.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.566
- Just half?
- Oh, yes.

33:59.371 --> 34:03.785
Because the other half
will be stuffed and mounted

34:03.875 --> 34:07.083
above my desk
as a warning to others

34:07.170 --> 34:10.833
that mistakes will
not be tolerated.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.592
Should we tell daddy?

34:19.181 --> 34:21.047
No, let's just
keep it a surprise.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.757
Do I make myself clear?

34:24.521 --> 34:26.887
Yeah, completely.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.850
I mean, especially
the bit about the...

34:32.279 --> 34:33.985
The other half body thing.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.357
Just go!

34:36.032 --> 34:38.023
Let's find out what
they're worth first.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.739
Bring me my diamonds.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.612
Or... those two boys.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.230
Look, jewelry.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.316
Surely, he'll know
how much it's worth.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.446
- Ask him.
- No, you ask him.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.243
- No, you ask him.
- No, you ask him.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.433
- No, you ask.
- No, you ask...

35:25.457 --> 35:26.788
Can I help you?

35:28.084 --> 35:30.746
Oh, uh, yes, we have
something to show you.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.919
We want to know how
much it's worth.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.542
It's worthless, I'm afraid.

36:14.839 --> 36:15.839
Junk.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.715
You boys are after a bit
of pocket money, aren't you?

36:24.224 --> 36:26.260
Well, I'll take it off
your hands for a tenner.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.718
Ten whole pound you didn't
have before you came in here.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.981
No, thank you.

36:37.654 --> 36:41.442
Okay, 50, 1007?

36:43.827 --> 36:44.827
1,000?

36:46.329 --> 36:47.329
Oh.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.739
You're a good negotiator.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.592
There they are.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.092
That's, that's the antique shop.

37:03.972 --> 37:04.972
Yes!

37:07.767 --> 37:10.975
- Come on, they must've sold them.
- They, they've sold them?

37:37.213 --> 37:38.213
Boo!

37:44.721 --> 37:47.053
Look, it's as I've told you.
They only had one

37:47.140 --> 37:48.220
and they took it away!

38:01.738 --> 38:04.525
Those men,
they must be criminals.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.822
What if they come here?

38:14.167 --> 38:16.453
Don't worry about them,
I got a plan.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.401
What the hell are you doing?

39:30.326 --> 39:33.318
These are begonias,
they're meant to be in bloom,

39:33.413 --> 39:36.951
but look at them. - There's half a
million pounds of our diamonds in there,

39:37.917 --> 39:40.203
and all you're worried
about is the blooming.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.203
I'm just saying,
anyone prepared to let

39:43.298 --> 39:45.334
begonias get
in a state like this.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.112
I'm just trying to figure out what
kind of people we're dealing with.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.546
Dealing with?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.397
When the boss finds out
that two snotty-nosed

39:51.472 --> 39:53.838
little kids made off
with our diamonds,

39:54.517 --> 39:57.509
- you'll know what we're dealing with.
- Don't be fooled.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.014
I need to relax.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.221
Kick back.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.104
In the 1920's,

40:09.198 --> 40:11.780
kids went up chimneys,
down coal mines,

40:11.868 --> 40:14.450
their blackened faces
risking more life than limb,

40:14.537 --> 40:16.152
than any adult ever could.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.201
They work for big powerful
businessmen.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.327
On a bmx?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.459
Just saying, kids work
for drug cartels

40:26.549 --> 40:28.710
on, on, on roller skates!

40:34.891 --> 40:36.552
Just be careful, that's all.

40:40.063 --> 40:43.351
Just tread carefully,
there's a light on.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.864
You boys had me worried.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.371
Are you sure there's
nothing you need to tell me?

41:05.838 --> 41:07.954
Security light!

41:08.049 --> 41:09.129
Oh, ah!

41:15.431 --> 41:16.921
Thought I heard something.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.224
That's quite
a nice bush, actually.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.098
Goodnight, Jake.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.265
What s... what the...

41:31.698 --> 41:33.063
It's rigged.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.580
Let's get in there.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.044
Dogs probably.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.545
Sweet dreams then, Jake.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.466
Right, right, right,
if you remove just one panel

41:57.557 --> 41:59.437
of glass, get to the door
handle, then we're in.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.179
Here, borrow
my gardening gloves.

42:03.438 --> 42:05.303
Go on. Pink?

42:18.619 --> 42:19.859
Okay.

42:22.498 --> 42:23.658
All right.

42:32.133 --> 42:33.133
Right.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.851
All right, I'm going
to smash my way in.

43:37.573 --> 43:38.573
Oh, my god.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.903
It's Mike Harris. What?

43:42.787 --> 43:44.448
The speedway rider, look!

43:45.873 --> 43:47.204
This must be his house.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.247
Oh, my god.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.451
I was at the euro
championships '94.

43:51.546 --> 43:54.441
He was three bikes back, then on the
last lap, he canes it up on the inside,

43:54.465 --> 43:56.581
front wheel almost
doesn't touch the ground.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.587
Boom, right on the line,
he takes from henshall.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.926
It was just beautiful.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.324
I bet that trophy is
here somewhere...

44:02.348 --> 44:04.634
- Right, that's it.
- No, no, no, no, wait.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.595
This is perfect.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.810
Harris hasn't won for a while.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.183
All these new kids,
younger, faster,

44:12.275 --> 44:15.017
I bet he hasn't won
any prize money for yonks.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.352
I hear his sponsor pulled out
and backed some other kid.

44:17.446 --> 44:18.811
What are you talking about?

44:21.617 --> 44:25.656
No one knows who took
those diamonds.

44:26.539 --> 44:29.576
If the police think he did,
and it makes perfect sense,

44:29.667 --> 44:31.783
he would need another
source of income.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.792
So... I'll make an anonymous
call to the police,

44:36.883 --> 44:40.421
tell them that I know for
a fact that Mike Harris has

44:40.511 --> 44:44.424
the diamonds and he has them
right there in his very house.

44:44.515 --> 44:48.133
They'll go there, find the
diamonds for us, the diamonds,

44:48.227 --> 44:50.138
theyllend up in
the evidence room for what?

44:50.229 --> 44:51.844
Two, three days
before they've done

44:51.939 --> 44:53.659
the paperwork, and then
they'll return them.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.851
How do you know that?

44:56.235 --> 44:58.476
Because my mom works down
at that police station.

44:58.571 --> 44:59.771
Your mom works for the police?

45:01.407 --> 45:02.647
As a cleaner.

45:02.742 --> 45:06.155
She's cool and she's
very supportive.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.912
And the other thing is, she
can get into that evidence room

45:09.999 --> 45:14.618
on her cleaning duties, which
happens to be tomorrow night.

45:14.712 --> 45:18.330
She can slip the diamonds back
to us, and from then on,

45:18.424 --> 45:20.039
we're in the clear.

45:20.134 --> 45:23.217
Meanwhile, Mike Harris
will be speeding

45:23.304 --> 45:25.761
his way to a life behind bars.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.006
What do you say, guys?

45:38.236 --> 45:39.976
I like it.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.694
But on one condition.

45:43.783 --> 45:47.492
If we try this
and it doesn't work,

45:48.829 --> 45:53.072
it'll be the last thing
you ever do, ever.

45:56.087 --> 45:57.087
Hmm?

45:58.631 --> 45:59.631
Yes, sir.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.925
- Yeah.
- Goody, goody, gumdrops.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.297
Let's do it.

46:16.649 --> 46:18.605
- Jake.
- Thank you.

46:19.610 --> 46:20.610
Sam.

46:23.155 --> 46:24.691
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, daddy.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.324
My pleasure.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.455
Boys, have you been
messing around down here?

46:35.543 --> 46:37.579
There's a brick on
a piece of string.

46:40.298 --> 46:42.218
- Do you think that...
- Who do you think it was?

46:45.136 --> 46:46.467
Negative, sir,

46:46.554 --> 46:48.294
there's a car parked
in the drive.

46:48.389 --> 46:49.970
Daddy. Yeah?

46:50.057 --> 46:52.093
There's something
that we need to tell you.

46:52.184 --> 46:55.301
Right.

46:55.396 --> 46:57.102
Um. =tell me in a minute.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.949
I'll just go and get the door.

47:05.197 --> 47:07.688
Do you think
it's about the diamonds? =no.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.111
Can I help you?

47:10.202 --> 47:11.863
Mr. Michael Harris?

47:11.954 --> 47:14.115
Detective inspector
Peter Hector.

47:15.416 --> 47:16.936
That's a lovely motor
you've got there.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.118
Bit of a diamond,
wouldn't you say?

47:20.212 --> 47:21.577
If this is about
that number plate,

47:21.672 --> 47:23.287
it never goes off
the end of that drive.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.797
It's not about the number
plate, is it?

47:28.929 --> 47:30.490
I - Mr. Michael Harris,

47:30.514 --> 47:31.799
we are entering your premises

47:31.932 --> 47:34.014
in accordance with section 32

47:34.101 --> 47:36.638
of the police and criminal
evidence act 1984...

47:36.729 --> 47:38.060
Wait, wait, what is this about?

47:41.025 --> 47:42.731
- Just stay calm.
- I am calm,

47:42.818 --> 47:44.809
- but this is ridiculous.
- Is it now?

47:46.822 --> 47:49.279
It must be to do
with the diamonds.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.982
Shall we tell them?

47:51.077 --> 47:54.695
Where's the boys' mother?
She's back home in America.

47:54.789 --> 47:55.789
Is she now?

47:56.874 --> 47:59.115
=-wwho do you think...
What should we do?

47:59.210 --> 48:00.825
Sir, I found them.

48:02.338 --> 48:03.748
That's, that's not mine.

48:04.924 --> 48:06.334
Precisely.

48:06.425 --> 48:09.667
Mr. Michael Harris, I am
arresting you on suspicion

48:09.762 --> 48:12.174
of the theft of half a million
pounds worth of diamonds...

48:12.264 --> 48:14.801
- Boys, 1 didn't do anything.
- You do not need to say anything,

48:14.892 --> 48:17.178
- but it may harm your...
- This is ridiculous.

48:17.269 --> 48:19.289
- I've done nothing wrong. Boys.
- You do not have to say anything,

48:19.313 --> 48:20.916
- but it harm your defense...
- Ah, ah, ah.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.147
When questioneaq,
something you later rely on...

48:33.828 --> 48:35.864
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- No!

48:35.996 --> 48:37.307
- He didn't do anything.
- Calm down.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.867
We found them. Calm down.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.114
But, but... =he'll be fine.

48:40.209 --> 48:41.665
We'll look after him, okay?

48:43.504 --> 48:45.482
Boys, I know this is
upsetting, but this is the law,

48:45.506 --> 48:47.588
and the law is there
to protect you and us.

48:47.675 --> 48:48.985
But, but he didn't do anything.

48:49.009 --> 48:50.545
He didn't, we found... but...

48:50.636 --> 48:52.797
Now, listen to me, your
mommy's going to be contacted,

48:52.888 --> 48:55.004
but until she returns,
you need to come with us.

48:59.562 --> 49:02.554
It's a really nice
facility, boys,

49:02.648 --> 49:04.889
with very caring professionals.

49:05.025 --> 49:07.858
You'll be well looked after,
you just need to come with us.

49:16.662 --> 49:19.529
But we need our teddies,
otherwise we'll be very sad.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.622
Okay then, let's go
get the teddies.

49:37.766 --> 49:41.475
Jake, run! - No, you
don't, come here. Come here, you two.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.352
Oh, come on. Stop, stop.

49:47.651 --> 49:49.016
Jake, out the window!

49:50.321 --> 49:51.902
Where are they?

49:53.824 --> 49:56.941
Oh. Oh, my god, the window.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.817
I can't see them,
they must have jumped.

49:58.913 --> 50:00.353
We're going to have
to radio this in.

50:01.165 --> 50:04.032
Hey, stop, you two! Come here!

50:08.839 --> 50:09.999
Stop!

50:12.843 --> 50:14.299
Where do you think you're going?

50:17.556 --> 50:19.046
Hey, hey, where are you going?

50:19.141 --> 50:21.132
Hey, stop, stop!

50:28.234 --> 50:30.225
Where did you...
Come back. Come here.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.728
Boys, stop!

50:39.495 --> 50:41.736
They're getting away!

50:43.958 --> 50:45.078
Hey, come on.

50:45.876 --> 50:46.876
Hey, oi!

50:47.628 --> 50:48.959
Stop these boys!

50:55.302 --> 50:56.302
I'll go and radio it in.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.137
All units, we have
our suspect under arrest,

51:08.232 --> 51:09.312
stolen diamonds in hand.

51:11.527 --> 51:12.858
Two boys on the run.

51:12.945 --> 51:15.357
I repeat,
two children on the run.

51:20.077 --> 51:24.161
Description, one blonde,
about, well...

51:25.332 --> 51:27.243
Not very high, um.

51:31.297 --> 51:32.787
Don't touch me!

51:32.881 --> 51:35.042
- Don't you touch me!
- Enjoy your stay with us.

51:35.134 --> 51:38.251
We look forward to welcoming you again.

51:38.345 --> 51:40.256
This way. =next!

51:40.347 --> 51:42.463
Right, down the stairs, come on.

51:43.475 --> 51:46.182
And who might you be?

51:46.270 --> 51:48.682
Mike, Michael Harris.

51:48.772 --> 51:52.139
Michael, lovely.

51:54.361 --> 51:55.361
Occupation?

51:55.988 --> 51:57.444
Speedway rider.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.522
Speedway rider.

52:00.993 --> 52:02.403
That's very good.

52:06.206 --> 52:07.571
Speedway rider.

52:09.209 --> 52:12.076
Speedway rider.

52:21.889 --> 52:23.675
Fabulous, reason for arrest?

52:24.683 --> 52:27.800
Theft of half a million
pounds worth of diamonds.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.011
- Disgusting.
- I, I didn't.

52:30.105 --> 52:33.563
Disgusting.

52:33.651 --> 52:34.669
Is this some kind of joke?

52:34.693 --> 52:35.693
Joke?

52:36.904 --> 52:38.485
We take crime very seriously.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.988
Very seriously, indeed.

52:43.744 --> 52:49.330
I've spent 23 years with
criminal after criminal,

52:50.167 --> 52:55.036
and I don't know
how much more... I can take.

52:55.130 --> 52:57.712
Look, my kids are out there,
god only knows where,

52:57.800 --> 52:59.631
and no one's doing
a thing about it.

53:01.720 --> 53:07.590
Well, no disrespect, but maybe
a little less grand theft

53:08.435 --> 53:12.474
and you might be at home
playing pass the parcel

53:12.564 --> 53:13.804
and eating ice cream.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.358
Cell number seven.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.737
Enjoy your stay.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.778
We look forward to working
with you again.

53:41.009 --> 53:42.465
This is all our fault.

53:44.054 --> 53:45.840
We can make it right.

53:45.931 --> 53:46.966
Should we call mommy?

53:47.057 --> 53:48.547
We just got daddy arrested.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.553
Calling mommy is not an option.

53:58.694 --> 54:00.650
We have to get daady out.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.353
Plus it's his race on Saturday.

54:02.448 --> 54:04.609
He'll never forgive us
if he misses that.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.459
I'm hungry.

54:19.465 --> 54:22.332
Look at all this,
this is energy food.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.792
Do you know how many trees
you can climb on one of these?

54:26.972 --> 54:30.305
When I'm gone, I do not want
you boys just sat staring

54:30.392 --> 54:32.553
into those screens for
the rest of your life.

54:33.353 --> 54:34.638
Come on, I've got a plan.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.023
Come on.

56:33.557 --> 56:35.843
L

57:17.225 --> 57:19.557
Oi, you two, come back here!

57:21.897 --> 57:23.603
Here! Hey!

57:38.413 --> 57:39.413
All units.

57:41.959 --> 57:44.200
All units, all units
to Glen close.

57:49.716 --> 57:51.832
Glen close, that's brilliant.

57:52.886 --> 57:57.926
I'm being serious, those two
little boys have escaped again.

57:59.351 --> 58:02.058
Yeah, all, all units,
all units up meryl street.

58:03.605 --> 58:05.186
Those kids again.

58:27.004 --> 58:30.087
- Hey, Lucy, how are you?
- Michael, I've been worried.

58:30.173 --> 58:32.710
- I've been calling Ana calling.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

58:32.801 --> 58:36.464
The boys and I have just
been playing and playing.

58:36.555 --> 58:37.555
You know how it is.

58:38.557 --> 58:42.175
Okay... would you put them on?

58:43.854 --> 58:44.889
I'd like to talk to them.

58:44.980 --> 58:47.687
Uh, yeah, of course, of course.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.981
Hey, boys, do you want
to take a break

58:50.068 --> 58:52.434
from the tennis
and talk to your mommy?

58:55.866 --> 58:57.010
- Really sorry.
- Really sorry.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.820
We'll pay you back, we promise.

58:58.910 --> 59:00.138
- We promise.
- We'll pay you back.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.948
- Sorry, so sorry.
- Come back, come back!

59:02.039 --> 59:03.154
No?

59:03.832 --> 59:04.832
Really?

59:07.794 --> 59:09.785
Hey, Sam, be nice to
Jake, all right?

59:09.880 --> 59:10.915
None of that stuff.

59:13.967 --> 59:16.674
Cheeky boys, you know
how they are, right?

59:18.263 --> 59:21.755
Okay, as long
as everything's fine.

59:26.438 --> 59:28.099
Is everything fine, Michael?

59:29.107 --> 59:30.267
Fine.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.358
Everything is great.

59:33.737 --> 59:34.977
It's all under control.

59:35.822 --> 59:36.822
Okay.

59:38.450 --> 59:40.236
See you soon, right?

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.050
Well, if you really
didn't do this,

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.678
yet the diamonds were
found in your house.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:51.850
You have to consider that
the real thieves are your boys.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:53.642
No, no way.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:58.519
In my line of work, we normally
find when people run,

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.023
they're guilty of something.

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:01.446
My boys are good boys.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.524
They would never do
something like that.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.284
Let me show you something.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.224
So, your boys would never
do something like that, eh?

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:31.968
Quite terrified, the poor lady.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.399
Probably a small mercy
we don't have the sound.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:14.973
Come on, come on.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.069
PC 383 Jackson.

01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:35.115
Uh, I'm sorry?

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.210
Who is this?

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:41.209
Lucy Harris,
who the hell are you?

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.290
I'm the policeman
guarding your house

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:47.048
while your husband's in jail and
your kids are on the run, miss.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:53.429
What?

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.478
- Hello?
- It's Lucy Harris.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.984
Get my husband on
the phone, please.

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:08.235
Do not put me on hold.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.681
- Well, just what...
- / am not waiting...

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.161
- No, no, no.
- Any longer.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.455
Just give him the phone.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:16.542
All right.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:20.744
There's a call for you.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.170
=-no. - Now, officially,

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:24.464
youre not meant to
have any more calls,

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:26.587
- but this lady here...
- No, no, no, no.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.511
She"s phoned about 57 times,
and she's not going to

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:32.634
- let it go, so, uh.
- No, just tell her

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.682
- I'm not in.
- Oh.

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.934
I'm just handing the phone
to your husband, madam,

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:41.435
in his cell.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:50.941
Lucy. Michael.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.111
What is going on? =just...

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:56.446
I leave you for a week
and this is what happens?

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.907
Stolen diamonds,
boys on the run?

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.335
- You... where are they, Michael?
- Just let me explain.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:04.162
! Knew you were irresponsible,

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.622
but this is off the scale...

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.253
- Ma'am.
- Just...

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:09.592
I am on the next flight.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.341
Listen... just let me explain.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.215
I'm sorry.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:06.348
Well, I don't know
if it was that weird dream

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:11.103
or the church, but I remember
something someone once said.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.777
"If you are lost and
you don't know what to do...

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.068
You should retrace your steps.”

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.021
So, that is what
we're going to do.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.504
Stop, wait!

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:58.362
This must be where
they were watching us from.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.915
- This looks like a bomb.
- Jake, just put it down.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.118
Suddenly, those years of lip
reading practice came in handy.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:57.542
Even with my lip reading skills,
this was a tough one.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:01.091
F couldn't be sure,
but he said something

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.460
about the police station.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:06.631
And a cleaner mom, very odd.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.017
Irnat was not the owner
of the shop.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.969
Rnose criminals have done
something with him.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.645
Boo!

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.252
I can only imagine

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.812
how terrible.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.518
If we're ever going

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.978
to get daddy out, it was time

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.813
to do something
a bit more drastic.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:00.693
! Knew I'd seen
that face before.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.694
Now this cleaner mom thing
is starting to make sense.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:07.241
Is she in on this?

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:33.180
Do you mind?

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:35.724
You are meant to be
a cleaner, not a masseuse.

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:38.181
Well, I've cleaned
everything else.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.438
Everything except
the evidence room.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.188
I could go down and do that.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.318
I just need the key.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:50.951
We don't clean
the evidence room.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.122
No one ever cleans
the evidence room.

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:58.326
The evidence room is
a dank and dirty place

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:01.913
full of unspeakable things
from unspeakable crimes.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:06.800
Well, I'll just stay
here then. Carry on.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.924
I've got two hours
of my shift left.

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.427
We'll soon have you
spick and span.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.181
Bon appetit.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.641
Merci, senor.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:28.653
I warn you, the smell
down there is so pungent

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:31.906
that you and your little
pompom friend

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.324
won't be down there very long.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:17.656
I don't know what's wrong
with that officer Pierce.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.991
Perhaps he needs to get
himself a girlfriend.

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:21.451
Would you do?

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:23.628
- Or a boyfriend.
- I yeah, move over.

01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:26.797
I mean, and that
one in cell 12, for goodness sake,

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:28.465
he is really...

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.132
I got the keys, son.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:37.058
Wait out the back and I'll have
those gems to you in no time.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:40.220
All right, mom.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.148
Yeah.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.694
Bye.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.230
What was that?

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:16.774
What the blazes?

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.285
What have you done
to this poor woman?

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.614
- Arrest them!
- Jake, run!

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.744
Stop, come here,
boys. Come here.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.793
Come here then.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.461
Stop, you little.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:31.630
Stop, come here, you two!

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:34.094
Stop!

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:54.357
Oh, my god.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:57.023
Stop.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.117
Stop, hmm?

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.199
Just...

01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:08.579
Hang on. Just stop, all right?

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.457
You don't know
what's going on, do you?

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:13.130
The cleaner's son is outside
at the back door right now

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.377
waiting for the diamonds!

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.919
That is ridiculous.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:21.047
What the, what?

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:26.765
This man, I know where he is,
I can get him for you,

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.266
if you give me my dad back.

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:33.183
Well, if you can prove
he's the real thief,

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:34.394
your dad goes free.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:51.953
Hello, boys.

01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.705
May I help you?

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.416
Your boys have failed
to get the diamonds.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:16:00.344
You need us, we're ready
to make a deal.

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.843
A deal?

01:16:06.103 --> 01:16:09.641
I stole those diamonds, hmm?

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:10.847
But okay.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.854
It's my deal, huh?

01:16:13.944 --> 01:16:18.153
Give me the diamonds
or I'll snap his neck like a...

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.275
How do you say, uh,
a lolly stick.

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:23.734
That's my brother!

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.740
Then you'd better be quick

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:28.322
or I'll snap both your necks.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.552
Violence is almost
never the answer,

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.953
unless we're talking
about an absolute bully.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.757
You're a bully, aren't you?

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:43.633
I'm only just getting started.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.841
Right there,
straight on the nose

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.052
with everything you've got.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.195
You want to punch really hard?

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.610
Punch through the bag.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.508
Wait a second,
let's rewind a bit.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:29.054
Detective Hector did check out
my story, and guess what?

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:32.561
They got those guys.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:38.752
But then I did have to deal
with a little bit of technology,

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.190
but for the right reasons.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.282
A deal?

01:17:45.953 --> 01:17:48.490
I stole those diamonds, hmm?

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:56.619
/t turns out the police
don't much like bullies either.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.213
I stole those diamonds.

01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:05.719
All in all, I think
it was a pretty good

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:07.967
day's work for detective Hector.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.641
But there was still one
pretty major thing left to do.

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:18.895
And we really have to do it
before mommy gets back.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.404
Boys, god, I've missed you.

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:31.074
I missed you, boys.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.489
I missed you so much.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:34.790
I really have.

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:38.873
Just a little paperwork.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.764
Three to four hours
and you'll be out of here.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:44.000
You'll be in time
for your race, daddy.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:47.089
No, boys, I don't care
about any of that now.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:49.843
The fact is you're safe, and
that's all that matters to me.

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:53.051
You have to, it's who you are.

01:18:53.145 --> 01:18:54.635
It's what you love.

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:56.888
And Jake was right.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.810
But my race is in 30 minutes.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.446
Put these on.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.698
You can do it, daddy. Come on.

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:15.365
It was like watching
daddy come alive again.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:19.369
Don't forget
to Polish that chrome.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:20.748
I want to shine when I win.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:22.465
Sure.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.167
Your radio, get me
the officer in charge.

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:06.426
Now.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:10.676
Sarge.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.425
=hi. - Mrs. Harris,

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:18.101
- detective Hector here.
- What is going on here?

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:21.897
We have your husband and
your boys, everyone is safe.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.100
It was a wrongful arrest,
I'm afraid.

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:26.731
We're escorting them
right now to the race track.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:30.731
You're taking them where?

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:35.448
His race, we should just
about make it in time.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.655
Are you insane?

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.240
No!

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.335
Mrs. Harris.

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:44.586
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.667
Here.

01:20:48.927 --> 01:20:52.169
I'll, uh, just use your loo, and
then I'll be on my way, miss.

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.426
Unbelievable.

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:14.737
I'm going to be speeding,
by the way.

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:26.211
- Good luck, daddy.
- Thank you.

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:28.375
- Good luck, daddy.
- Thank you.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:29.867
- Go fast.
- See you from the stand.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.682
How long do I have?

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:02.452
The riders
are lining up for the finals.

01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:21.805
And they're off!

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.175
A great start from Chris Warren,

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.720
but local champ, Kevin Jenkins,

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.180
is having none of that.

01:22:29.027 --> 01:22:32.565
Jenkins leads, but Mike
Harris is catching up.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:42.280
And he's chasing his tail.

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:47.789
Jenkins leads.
Harris is catching up.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.711
He's really giving
his all today.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:52.835
Watching as Mike Harris
overtakes into the turn.

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:54.507
Unbelievable!

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.551
Oh, Harris is down!

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.548
Mike Harris 1s down.

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.049
Red flag.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.132
Harris is down.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.342
This looks like a bad one.

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.268
He's not moving.

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:06.936
The helmet's off.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:08.605
Medics, medics.

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.153
Ladies and gentiemen,
he's moving.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:18.531
Well, that'll be it
for Mike Harris.

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:21.452
Mike Harris will be
surely leaving the race,

01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:22.948
ladies and gentiemen.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.231
Don't worry, he'll be okay.

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:54.902
And that's it,
Mike Harris is out.

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:57.612
No, wait, please.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.405
Just, my boys are watching.

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.317
If they see me walk
away like this,

01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:03.652
what does that teach them?

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.412
I want them to know
anything is possible.

01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.200
You're a father,
you understand that, right?

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:11.918
Please just let me finish this.

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:15.372
Just let me race
and I promise you,

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:17.712
I'll never race again.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.675
Wait.

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:24.347
- Ihank you.
- Incredibly,

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:26.516
the Marshall has overruled.

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:29.561
Mike Harris is allowed
one more race.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:33.732
Riders, you have two minutes.

01:24:39.866 --> 01:24:41.553
Mommy and daddy
haven't looked at each other

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.238
like this since
we've been alive.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:52.706
It's something called
support... and appreciation.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.792
And we should all do it more.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:01.714
- What else am I good at?
- It's so dangerous.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:03.199
Go and do something important.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:04.508
Why didn't you do anything?

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.056
It's a young man's game.

01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:07.883
You have to, it's who you are.

01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:10.206
- When I'm gone...
- It's what you love.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.721
I do not want you boys sat
staring into those devices for

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:14.101
the rest of your life.

01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:16.774
Riders are lined up.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:19.437
Counting down.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:28.153
And they're off. An incredible start
for Harris. He's flying, folks.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:30.864
Phenomenal turn, I've never
seen anything like it.

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.244
Jenkins battered with dirt.

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:33.826
Harris powering forward.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.878
This is like the euro
championship of '94.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:42.050
Jenkins gives it all,
it's nowhere near enough.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:47.681
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike Harris wins.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:51.472
Vwhat a celebration this will be.

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:10.362
Those TV people
asked Kevin Jenkins

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:14.450
what it was like to be a loser
and he declined to comment.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.502
We all make mistakes,
it's a part of life.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.629
But when we do,
it's how we fix them.

01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:27.595
- Keep the change!
- Sorry again!

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:28.718
Bye.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:41.105
Come on, let's get back
to our cell.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.941
What goes around comes around.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.901
Sometimes we have to accept
that things are unfair,

01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:51.577
but maybe there's a reason.

01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:00.378
Now daddy does drive
that old car,

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.171
but only for special occasions.

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:05.217
Ah, Mr. Harris, I presume?

01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.837
And you must be
the two young lads.

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:14.802
Master Jake and master Samuel,
come this way.

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.352
And what could be more special

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.147
than visiting england's
largest castle?

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.601
Lady hurst
is expecting you, sir.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:23.856
Thank you.

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.074
May I present, lady hurst.

01:27:37.169 --> 01:27:39.455
Master Jake and master Samuel.

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:46.796
You have both shown incredible
bravery and courage,

01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:48.502
and that must be rewarded.

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:01.602
I'm sure I saw
a tear in daddy's eye,

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.108
but of course he denies it.

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.110
I suppose you're wondering
what is in

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.907
those little posh pouches.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:12.484
Well, here's a little clue.

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:16.454
And did I get my dream girl?

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.032
Well, I'll leave that
to your imagination.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:28.255
J locked in time with
no space to breathe j

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:30.843
ji look around j

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.972

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:41.605

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:44.979

j feeling the earth
beneath our feet j

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:00.978
now it's time
for all of us to get off

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.243
our devices and get out there.

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:04.953
Adventure awaits.

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:06.288
Thanks for watching.

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:14.509
J it is what we really need j

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:17.056

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.934
okay, take two.

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:57.464
Everybody quiet on set.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.559
Get ready, everyone else
walking in the background.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:01.969
And Rory, on action. Look
caught out and say the line.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.394
And three, two, one, action.

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:05.305
Observe, look back.

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:08.566
Sorry.

01:30:08.653 --> 01:30:09.813
Action.

01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:12.812
And coming through.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:16.696
J is this what my soul's
been dreaming of? J;

01:30:16.786 --> 01:30:18.902
one more time.

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:23.036
J feeling the earth
beneath our feet j

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.918
quick, Rory,
quick, quick, quick!

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:28.791
Oh, cut, he's, he's fallen off.

01:30:31.134 --> 01:30:34.592
I'm Lisa Harris. No,
I'm not, I'm Lucy Harris.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:36.840
I'm sorry. Okay,
just go for that again.

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:37.967
Uh.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.891
J I'm running free j'

01:30:40.977 --> 01:30:42.888
did you have the gloves on?

01:30:42.979 --> 01:30:44.957
- Read the whole thing again.
- I'm trying to open it.

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:46.096
There you go.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:49.151
Look a bit up, yeah.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.477
And Felix, turn up in the
background, look at each other.

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:57.115
Not a smile, you've found, you've
found the lot, you're intrigued.

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:00.322
Rory, climb in there.

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:03.906
I want them to know
anything is possible.

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:07.375
You're a father,
you understand that, right?

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:10.875
Please, just, let me
finish this, let me race.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:14.800
I promise you...
I'll never race again.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.215
And then nod your head.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.012
Detective inspector
Peter Hector.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:25.802
If this is about that...
Do it again, keep rolling, keep rolling.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:28.764
- Action!
- You don't know what's going on, do you?

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:31.725
No,
"you don't know what's going on."

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.811
He's adjusting,
ohe scene is down.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:36.237
Ready, and three,
two, one, action.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.612
Look, jewelry,
surely he'll know how to...

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:45.743
Look, it's as I told you. They had
one and they took it away with them.

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:47.687
- =sorry, I couldn't get the bloody thing.
- Cut.

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:49.772
Rolling.
Take two, get ready. Whoa!

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:51.536
Three, two, one, track, action.

J I'm running free j'

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.715

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.841
Go, guys, chase. Ow.

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:03.890
It's Clint, Clint Eastwood,

01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:05.888
and he's the best actor
who ever lived.

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:08.765
And I've messed it up,
take it back.

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:10.267
Keep rolling.
