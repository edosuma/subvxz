00:00.368 --> 00:01.435
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.468 --> 00:03.037
What's going on?

00:03.071 --> 00:04.933
- Divorce.
- What do you mean divorce?

00:04.953 --> 00:07.011
We will be there for you,
no matter what.

00:07.031 --> 00:08.609
No you won't! Because if you
wanted to be there for me,

00:08.643 --> 00:10.043
then you wouldn't be doing this!

00:10.077 --> 00:11.578
Are you in love?

00:11.613 --> 00:12.780
No, I barely speak to her.

00:12.814 --> 00:14.448
I mean with Casey.

00:16.796 --> 00:20.354
Come on, we both know Caleb's not
gonna come up with the cash in time,

00:20.388 --> 00:22.122
so pack up your stuff
and get out.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.035
- don't do this.
- Oh, I'm just getting started.

00:24.055 --> 00:25.391
Ungh!

00:25.426 --> 00:27.560
Oh!

00:27.594 --> 00:29.963
- Get your hands off me!
- I've got you now.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.476
Ty, what's going on?
Where were you...?

00:34.880 --> 00:37.067
I think I might be
in trouble, Amy.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

00:48.514 --> 00:49.849
Here we are.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.453
Are you nervous?

00:54.487 --> 00:57.556
A little. Mostly just excited.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.958
- Me too.
- Yeah.

01:31.102 --> 01:33.524
You must be the young couple
that Joanna was telling me about.

01:33.558 --> 01:35.426
Ty and Amy.

01:35.460 --> 01:37.828
Yes... hi. Thanks
you for doing this.

01:37.863 --> 01:40.337
We really appreciate it,
especially on such short notice.

01:40.357 --> 01:44.769
"Why put off till
tomorrow, what you can do today?"

01:44.803 --> 01:47.637
This is my husband. He'll
be acting as your witness.

01:53.311 --> 01:55.779
All right then. Let's begin.

01:55.813 --> 01:58.097
Are you both ready?

02:09.414 --> 02:12.328
Okay, so... your wedding
date is on the 29th.

02:12.362 --> 02:14.669
Which gives us very little time
to tie up loose ends.

02:14.689 --> 02:18.097
For example, somebody needs to call
back all of the guests who didn't rsvp.

02:18.117 --> 02:21.804
And, by my count, there are at least
20 people who haven't replied yet.

02:21.838 --> 02:24.040
Okay, I will do that
as soon as I get back.

02:24.074 --> 02:25.607
Great. And I'm gonna
call each of the vendors

02:25.642 --> 02:27.743
and reconfirm every last detail.

02:27.777 --> 02:29.006
Okay, thanks, Lou.
That's a great idea.

02:29.026 --> 02:31.798
- What about your shoes?
- My shoes...?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.950
Yeah, have
you practiced walking in them yet?

02:33.984 --> 02:35.541
Uh... just at the store.

02:35.561 --> 02:37.319
Amy, aren't you worried that
you're gonna trip down the aisle

02:37.353 --> 02:39.588
or land face first
on the dance floor?

02:39.622 --> 02:41.673
I guess I am now. Why can't
I just wear cowboy boots?

02:41.693 --> 02:44.159
When you get back, I want you in
those shoes doing laps around the house.

02:44.193 --> 02:45.761
You can wear them
while you're on the phone.

02:45.795 --> 02:46.962
Great. Okay, I will, but
I've gotta go right now.

02:46.996 --> 02:48.525
- I'm meeting Scott.
- Okay.

02:48.545 --> 02:51.500
Just hurry back, okay?

02:51.534 --> 02:55.003
Oh, Amy, you know what?
I almost forgot.

02:55.037 --> 02:57.840
You need to tell Ty to get his
hair cut, preferably today.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.627
What? Why?

02:58.647 --> 03:01.343
Because if he goes
to the barber too close to the wedding,

03:01.377 --> 03:03.345
then he's gonna look like
it's his 6th grade picture day.

03:03.379 --> 03:04.879
- Ugh. Okay.
- Where is Ty anyway?

03:04.913 --> 03:06.547
He's studying at his place.

03:06.582 --> 03:08.450
At the trailer? I
thought he got kicked out.

03:08.484 --> 03:11.298
Jesse doesn't take possession of the land
until the end of the month.

03:11.318 --> 03:13.320
I guess we can officially take
Jesse Stanton off the guest list?

03:13.355 --> 03:15.122
Yes, that's probably a good idea.
I really have to go, Lou.

03:15.156 --> 03:16.924
Okay,
look, as soon as you get back,

03:16.959 --> 03:18.647
we'll just go over the seating
chart one last time.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.461
Okay.

03:46.086 --> 03:48.321
Sort of creepy, isn't it?

03:49.089 --> 03:51.925
Yeah, you
could say that again.

03:52.104 --> 03:54.394
So what happened to the owners?

03:54.428 --> 03:56.229
Couldn't pay their mortgage.

03:56.263 --> 03:58.264
Took off in the middle
of the night.

03:58.298 --> 04:00.466
And the horse they left behind
is not been broke

04:00.501 --> 04:02.804
and definitely is not used
to being around people.

04:02.824 --> 04:05.132
Come on, I'll show you.

04:05.972 --> 04:07.904
You sure you have
time to take on a new horse?

04:07.924 --> 04:09.675
Yeah, of course.

04:09.709 --> 04:11.386
Aren't you
getting married soon?

04:11.406 --> 04:12.731
Am I?

04:12.751 --> 04:14.848
Oh, yeah, I guess I am.

04:24.801 --> 04:26.488
Hey, boy.

04:28.227 --> 04:30.629
Whoa, hey.

04:31.324 --> 04:32.630
Hey, hey.

04:35.019 --> 04:38.203
Whoa...

04:40.658 --> 04:42.439
Let's get him in the trailer.

05:06.586 --> 05:08.632
You Ty Borden?

05:08.666 --> 05:10.867
- Yeah.
- I'm Officer Wright.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.437
I need you to step outside.

05:16.742 --> 05:20.144
You're under arrest for
the assault of Jesse Stanton.

05:20.178 --> 05:23.179
It's my duty to inform you you're
not obliged to say anything.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.836
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

05:25.856 --> 05:28.189
You also have the right...

05:51.642 --> 05:55.044
Ha!

06:16.084 --> 06:19.670
S08E17
All I Need Is You

06:19.690 --> 06:23.293
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:59.608 --> 07:01.802
Come on, Jack.
Pick up the pace.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.376
Oh, what's your big hurry?

07:03.411 --> 07:04.778
It's Casey's birthday.
I got plans.

07:04.813 --> 07:06.780
Well, go on ahead then.

07:06.815 --> 07:09.883
Paint doesn't seem to have
a lot of gas in the tank today.

07:09.918 --> 07:12.908
Well, it's no wonder. He's
not as young as he used to be.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.823
Old Paint should be...
grazing in a field

07:15.857 --> 07:17.657
instead of worrying about
hauling your butt around.

07:17.692 --> 07:19.359
Now just because
he's getting on in years

07:19.393 --> 07:22.278
doesn't mean he's ready
for the pasture.

07:22.489 --> 07:23.996
That goes for me too.

07:24.031 --> 07:26.466
Yeah, yeah. You might not
be ready to retire, Jack,

07:26.500 --> 07:29.441
but judging by the way
that horse is moving,

07:29.949 --> 07:32.105
I think he is.

07:53.656 --> 07:55.096
Hey, Ty.

07:55.116 --> 07:58.330
So that horse that Scott and I
picked up is quite a handful.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.466
I'm gonna start working
with him today,

08:00.500 --> 08:04.001
that is if Lou doesn't rope me
into making wedding place cards

08:04.021 --> 08:06.028
or God knows what else.

08:06.048 --> 08:07.338
Oh, and um...

08:07.373 --> 08:09.440
Lou wants you
to get your hair cut.

08:09.475 --> 08:11.576
I think it looks good
the way it is.

08:11.610 --> 08:14.846
Uh... anyway, I hope your
studying is going well.

08:14.881 --> 08:16.481
I love you.
I'll talk to you soon.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.626
I thought you were
taking me out for dinner.

08:29.363 --> 08:32.897
Uh, well, I am... in a way.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.232
I've-I've arranged
for something...

08:36.268 --> 08:38.235
in conjunction with Maggie's...

08:38.270 --> 08:41.438
very special for the occasion.

08:41.472 --> 08:43.717
Well, that
sounds very romantic,

08:43.736 --> 08:45.475
but what's the occasion?

08:45.510 --> 08:47.836
You didn't think I'd
miss your birthday, do you?

08:52.772 --> 08:54.645
Oh, wow...!

08:56.730 --> 08:58.254
What?

08:58.654 --> 09:01.257
No, it's nothing,
it's just um...

09:02.172 --> 09:04.260
It's not your birthday.

09:04.939 --> 09:07.331
No, I mean, it's sort of...

09:07.806 --> 09:09.238
- Sort of...
- I mean...

09:09.258 --> 09:11.351
It's the 15th,
so you're not that far...

09:11.371 --> 09:13.419
How far off?

09:14.548 --> 09:16.439
Um... well, you're only off
by three...

09:16.459 --> 09:17.916
- Days?
- Weeks.

09:17.936 --> 09:20.910
Three weeks. Three weeks?

09:20.945 --> 09:22.611
But Tim...
It doesn't matter!

09:22.646 --> 09:24.546
I-I...

09:24.566 --> 09:26.229
Shut up.

09:30.387 --> 09:31.754
Ss! Ss!

09:34.600 --> 09:36.648
Ss!

09:53.042 --> 09:55.395
You're okay...

09:55.415 --> 09:57.525
Hey, settle.

09:58.948 --> 10:00.682
Whoa.

10:03.586 --> 10:06.588
- Amy, look out!
- Whoa! Ungh!

10:11.861 --> 10:14.506
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:14.816 --> 10:16.564
This guy's not so well behaved.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.600
Okay, well I'm supposed
to tell you to go inside.

10:18.634 --> 10:21.175
Lou and Lisa are fighting about
the floor plan for the reception.

10:21.195 --> 10:23.279
It's getting really ugly.

10:23.428 --> 10:24.238
Okay, I'll go in.

10:24.273 --> 10:25.970
You want me to put him
in his stall?

10:25.990 --> 10:27.844
No. You better let me handle it.

10:27.864 --> 10:29.544
He's not really used to people.

10:33.648 --> 10:35.686
I'd just keep your distance
from him for now.

10:35.706 --> 10:37.225
He's got a bad temper.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.453
Amy,

10:38.473 --> 10:39.893
you got a few minutes?

10:39.913 --> 10:42.188
Uh, Lou's waiting for me inside.

10:42.223 --> 10:44.758
Well, it won't take long. I
need your opinion on something.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.327
- Okay.
- Well, it's old Paint here.

10:47.361 --> 10:50.803
Doesn't seem like
he has much get up and go.

10:50.823 --> 10:52.799
It might be his arthritis.
It could be getting worse.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.679
Well, if the right
thing to do is to...

10:55.699 --> 10:57.740
stop riding him,
I'll do that, but...

10:57.760 --> 10:59.701
Well, we could try
equine massage.

10:59.721 --> 11:01.773
I've been a lot of reading
about it online.

11:01.793 --> 11:02.675
That's a good idea.

11:02.709 --> 11:05.248
It might help soothe his joints
and relax his muscles.

11:05.268 --> 11:07.555
We'd sure appreciate it.

11:09.516 --> 11:12.325
We've already chosen the colours
for the decorative fabric panels,

11:12.345 --> 11:14.487
and we are going
with more muted tones.

11:14.521 --> 11:16.656
Your tablecloths are white.
Plain.

11:16.690 --> 11:19.656
I mean, you go with muted
tones, it's... kinda dull.

11:19.676 --> 11:20.909
But these... look.

11:20.929 --> 11:22.374
Look how charming
these colours are together.

11:22.394 --> 11:24.173
I'm pretty sure those
are the same colours

11:24.193 --> 11:27.308
they used in the arena
when the circus came to town.

11:27.444 --> 11:29.335
What do you think?

11:29.850 --> 11:31.828
- I really like that.
- See?

11:31.848 --> 11:34.353
But I... I also like that.

11:34.373 --> 11:36.908
Okay, so... which is it?

11:36.943 --> 11:38.209
I trust you guys completely,

11:38.243 --> 11:40.812
so whatever you decide,
I'm happy with.

11:40.847 --> 11:43.047
Amy, you have to be
the tie breaker here.

11:43.082 --> 11:45.416
No, I don't,
because, luckily,

11:45.451 --> 11:48.786
I have the two best wedding
planners a girl could ask for.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.621
So you just carry on
with what you're doing.

11:50.655 --> 11:53.458
I trust you completely.
Thank you.

11:59.364 --> 12:01.632
Oh,
it's a wonderful night.

12:02.253 --> 12:04.167
I'm a lucky girl.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.612
This is close to perfect.

12:08.632 --> 12:10.770
Mmm...

12:11.877 --> 12:15.612
You know, it's
important that you know...

12:18.016 --> 12:20.783
that I'm not interested
in seeing anyone else.

12:23.531 --> 12:27.257
- You're the girl for me.
- Mm...

12:27.291 --> 12:30.727
- The only one.
- Me too...

12:34.235 --> 12:35.985
I love you.

12:37.772 --> 12:39.602
Mmm...

12:44.238 --> 12:47.644
I do... really love you.

12:47.948 --> 12:49.512
Mmm...

12:55.939 --> 12:58.087
I'm tired.

12:58.297 --> 13:00.456
I think I had
too much champagne.

13:02.255 --> 13:04.705
I'm gonna go freshen up.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.928
Thanks for coming.

13:33.752 --> 13:35.256
Assault?

13:39.506 --> 13:40.950
I know...

13:44.032 --> 13:46.000
I'll pay you back
the bail money.

13:49.127 --> 13:50.778
I'm sorry.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.270
So, do you wanna swing by
Heartland for breakfast?

13:58.304 --> 14:00.908
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay!

14:03.274 --> 14:05.844
Oh, Tim...?

14:06.361 --> 14:08.113
Thanks again for last night.

14:08.147 --> 14:11.783
It was wonderful.
My best not-my-birthday ever.

14:14.911 --> 14:16.220
Hey, Casey...

14:16.255 --> 14:19.790
That-that stuff
I said last night about...

14:19.824 --> 14:21.359
Well, that I'm not seeing
anyone else and...

14:21.393 --> 14:23.628
and you're the only and...

14:26.616 --> 14:28.499
Yeah?

14:29.072 --> 14:30.722
I... I meant that.

14:30.921 --> 14:32.708
So did I.

14:42.187 --> 14:44.632
Good morning?

14:45.376 --> 14:47.918
Are you gonna be more
cooperative today?

14:52.689 --> 14:54.258
Guess not.

14:54.278 --> 14:58.977
- Amy?
- Ty! Hey!

14:58.997 --> 15:00.875
Did you get my messages?
Where have you been?

15:00.895 --> 15:03.030
Is everything okay?

15:04.879 --> 15:06.035
You need a really good lawyer.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.650
Well, I actually
spoke with one yesterday

15:07.670 --> 15:09.771
and she said a lot
will depend on the judge.

15:09.806 --> 15:11.796
So when's your court date?

15:11.816 --> 15:12.707
Next month.

15:12.727 --> 15:14.843
You know,
Jesse, with his deep pockets,

15:14.878 --> 15:17.346
you can bet he's gonna have a
whole team of hot-shot lawyers,

15:17.381 --> 15:20.216
so you just have to make sure
yours has a good game plan.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.984
These charges
are so ridiculous.

15:22.018 --> 15:24.285
Jesse provoked Ty. On purpose.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.254
Actually, I tackled
him first, Amy.

15:26.288 --> 15:27.188
I lost my temper.

15:27.223 --> 15:29.224
Good morning!

15:29.822 --> 15:31.292
Hey, everybody!

15:31.327 --> 15:33.471
Did we make it in
time for breakfast?

15:33.491 --> 15:35.597
Yeah, we are just getting started.
Let me set you guys a place.

15:35.632 --> 15:38.510
- I'll get some plates.
- I'll get a chair for you.

15:40.967 --> 15:44.332
What-what's... what's going on?
Why is everybody so glum?

15:46.785 --> 15:50.172
Is it the wedding extravaganza?

15:50.192 --> 15:53.114
All the planning and preparation
for a few hours of wedding

15:53.149 --> 15:56.383
and then - phhhewt!
Done?

15:56.418 --> 15:58.786
When I look back on my wedding,

15:58.820 --> 16:01.856
it probably would've been better
if Marion and I had just eloped.

16:01.890 --> 16:03.691
Seriously,
what is going on here, guys?

16:03.725 --> 16:05.760
Ty got arrested.

16:05.794 --> 16:07.828
What? What'd you do this time?

16:07.863 --> 16:09.931
Dad! Can we just not
talk about this please?

16:09.965 --> 16:12.232
- What-what for?
- Leave him alone.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.535
No, I... I think it's
a reasonable question.

16:14.569 --> 16:16.836
Jesse Stanton filed a complaint
against me.

16:16.871 --> 16:19.413
- Why would he do that?
- Because I beat him up.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.075
You beat him up.

16:23.611 --> 16:25.845
That's serious.
You can go to jail for that.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.281
That is obviously the
worst case scenario, okay?

16:28.315 --> 16:30.083
Jesse is blowing this
out of proportion

16:30.117 --> 16:31.484
and-and-and it is his word
against Ty's.

16:31.518 --> 16:33.653
Actually, it's not.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.354
There were two construction
workers there

16:35.389 --> 16:37.256
at the time that it happened,

16:37.291 --> 16:38.925
and my lawyer said
that they're gonna testify

16:38.960 --> 16:40.760
that I beat up Jesse unprovoked.

16:40.795 --> 16:42.929
They were probably
on Jesse's payroll.

16:42.964 --> 16:46.505
How long did your lawyer say
you could go to jail for?

16:48.976 --> 16:50.336
A few years.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.572
- Years.
- Dad, can we...

16:52.606 --> 16:54.168
- Wow.
- Please stop talking about this?!

16:54.188 --> 16:55.608
No, I don't think so.

16:55.642 --> 16:56.909
I don't think so.
We need to talk about this

16:56.943 --> 16:58.578
because you two
are getting married

16:58.612 --> 17:02.848
and Ty could be going away
for a very long time.

17:02.882 --> 17:05.917
You need to have a plan,
both of you.

17:05.952 --> 17:07.752
Well, right now I need
to get some sleep.

17:07.787 --> 17:10.521
Um, can I get a lift?

17:10.556 --> 17:13.358
Why don't just...
rest in the loft?

17:13.392 --> 17:15.761
You don't need to go
all the way home.

17:15.795 --> 17:17.464
Okay.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.278
I brought you
some extra blankets.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.382
Thanks.

17:32.811 --> 17:35.913
Ty, this is all gonna be over soon.
You'll see.

17:35.948 --> 17:39.316
I mean, there's no way any judge
is gonna take Jesse's side.

17:40.765 --> 17:42.586
I
instigated the fight, Amy.

17:42.621 --> 17:45.322
I know you're trying
to be positive,

17:45.357 --> 17:47.421
but there's a very good chance
I could be found guilty.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.027
That's not gonna happen.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.489
You don't know that.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.631
Ty, I love you.

17:53.665 --> 17:55.432
No matter what, okay?
It doesn't change anything.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.929
I know, and I
love you too, Amy.

17:58.538 --> 18:00.237
But your dad is right.

18:00.272 --> 18:03.040
I could go to jail
for a very long time

18:03.074 --> 18:05.809
- and if we go through with this wed...
- If?!

18:06.322 --> 18:07.744
What do you mean by "if"?

18:07.779 --> 18:10.579
If... we go through
with this wedding,

18:11.013 --> 18:13.728
we could be apart for years.

18:15.031 --> 18:17.215
Are we ready for that?

18:18.841 --> 18:21.447
I'm sorry, Amy. I really am...

18:22.960 --> 18:25.119
but this changes everything.

18:47.357 --> 18:51.053
Jesse. This is Amy Fleming.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.455
I need to call me back
as soon as you can.

18:54.321 --> 18:56.009
Thanks.

19:01.764 --> 19:03.832
I guess I should have
a talk with Jesse Stanton.

19:03.866 --> 19:06.235
- A bad idea.
- Jack's right.

19:06.269 --> 19:08.316
You'll just stir up
a hornets' nest.

19:08.336 --> 19:10.439
I hate to bring this up, but
maybe we should suggest to Ty and Amy

19:10.473 --> 19:12.714
that they postpone the wedding?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.508
No. No way.

19:14.543 --> 19:16.827
Well, we can't forget
that Val Stanton's invited

19:16.847 --> 19:18.579
and how awkward
is that gonna be?

19:18.614 --> 19:21.449
No, no. Jesse is Val's son.
Val doesn't come to the wedding.

19:21.483 --> 19:24.285
We'll worry about
Val Stanton later.

19:24.319 --> 19:27.452
As for now, we are proceeding
forward as planned.

19:29.842 --> 19:31.592
Hey!

19:31.627 --> 19:33.327
Did I miss breakfast?

19:33.362 --> 19:36.163
You're here! I-I thought you
were at a conference in Berlin.

19:36.197 --> 19:37.865
Yeah, I managed to get a
junior associate to cover it for me,

19:37.899 --> 19:39.667
and grabbed the red eye, so...

19:39.701 --> 19:43.137
- Daddy, daddy, daddy!
- Hey! Wah!

19:43.171 --> 19:45.473
There she is!
I missed you, Kitty Kat!

19:47.575 --> 19:49.509
Sorry, I should've given you
a call and...

19:49.543 --> 19:52.547
Don't-don't be silly.
I'll get you some breakfast.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.680
Okay.

19:54.254 --> 19:55.855
Yay!

20:10.132 --> 20:11.956
Couldn't sleep?

20:14.785 --> 20:17.654
No. I uh...

20:18.808 --> 20:20.372
I've been thinking too much.

20:20.918 --> 20:23.648
You got a lot to think about.

20:24.219 --> 20:27.379
How did I let this happen, Jack?

20:27.967 --> 20:30.216
I thought I'd changed, I...

20:30.997 --> 20:32.885
I thought I had, but...

20:32.920 --> 20:34.453
I'm still that stupid kid
from juvie

20:34.487 --> 20:37.182
who moved up to this loft
eight years ago.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.491
Oh, that's B.S.

20:39.526 --> 20:41.483
You're not the same kid
that moved up here.

20:41.503 --> 20:43.295
Not by a long shot.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.368
You think I'd let you marry
my granddaughter

20:45.388 --> 20:47.032
if that were true?

20:47.066 --> 20:50.110
Eight years ago
when you moved up here,

20:50.130 --> 20:53.771
what did I say to you?

20:53.806 --> 20:56.241
You said that if
it were up to you,

20:56.275 --> 20:58.896
you'd kick my butt
so far down the road

20:58.916 --> 21:01.813
- I'd be crapping in Montana.
- Yes, I did say that,

21:01.848 --> 21:05.383
but I also said something
about my granddaughters.

21:05.417 --> 21:11.522
Yeah... you said to keep ten
feet from them at all times

21:11.557 --> 21:13.588
and then you threatened
to remove any part of me

21:13.608 --> 21:14.959
that crossed that line.

21:14.993 --> 21:18.529
Well, it's obvious
you didn't listen to me.

21:18.564 --> 21:21.833
But I'm glad you didn't,
and I'm gonna tell you why.

21:21.867 --> 21:25.302
Watching you grow up
over these past eight years

21:25.337 --> 21:29.373
confirms something
that I've always believed;

21:29.680 --> 21:32.217
that the goodness in a man
runs much deeper

21:32.237 --> 21:34.334
than one moment in time.

21:36.940 --> 21:39.236
You're a good man, Ty Borden.

21:40.151 --> 21:44.210
I wanna
believe that, I do,

21:45.155 --> 21:47.524
but I can't keep messing up
like this, Jack.

21:47.558 --> 21:50.594
I don't judge a
man for his mistakes.

21:50.628 --> 21:53.764
It's what he does to repair
those mistakes that counts.

21:54.488 --> 21:56.600
Now, you and Amy,

21:56.634 --> 21:59.235
you got a lot of decisions
to make over the next few days

21:59.270 --> 22:02.715
and I have no doubt
you'll do the right thing.

22:02.839 --> 22:04.407
Well, I better get going.

22:04.441 --> 22:06.642
If I don't have that dude ranch
in perfect shape,

22:06.676 --> 22:10.280
Lou will be kicking my butt
so far down the road...

22:10.314 --> 22:13.604
You'll be crapping in Montana.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.466
Here you go.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.535
Sorry, the uh... eggs
are probably a little dry.

22:33.569 --> 22:36.134
Oh, no, are you kidding me?
It looks great.

22:36.270 --> 22:38.740
Thank you so much.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.897
And Lou, I will call
before I come next time, I just...

22:41.917 --> 22:44.046
I told you, it's fine.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.646
Georgie and Katie get more time
with their dad,

22:47.666 --> 22:50.117
and that's all that matters.

22:50.152 --> 22:51.815
Where is Georgie, by the way?

22:51.835 --> 22:55.790
Oh, she's out in the barn
helping Amy.

22:55.825 --> 22:58.406
Probably trying to get away
from all of this...

22:58.426 --> 23:01.347
wedding craziness.

23:01.730 --> 23:04.031
Who am I kidding, she's
probably trying to escape me.

23:04.066 --> 23:05.799
Oh, that's not true, come on.

23:05.834 --> 23:08.660
Oh, no, it is. I've been...

23:08.680 --> 23:10.171
a total nightmare lately.

23:10.205 --> 23:12.173
But somebody has
to throw this wedding

23:12.207 --> 23:14.649
and I feel like if I don't nag
everyone to death,

23:14.669 --> 23:16.510
nothing gets done.

23:17.089 --> 23:20.171
I hate being that person,
Peter, but I just...

23:20.191 --> 23:23.049
I just want my sister's
wedding day to be special,

23:23.084 --> 23:25.048
you know?
And I thought she did too,

23:25.068 --> 23:26.720
but now I'm not so sure.

23:26.754 --> 23:29.730
Maybe she'd be happier
with crepe paper decorations

23:29.750 --> 23:32.020
and beef on a bun.

23:32.269 --> 23:34.194
Well, maybe.

23:34.228 --> 23:38.098
And Lisa, she... she says
she's trying to help, but...

23:38.132 --> 23:42.869
all she does is second guess
every decision I make.

23:43.294 --> 23:46.506
And on top of everything,
Katie and Georgie, they...

23:46.540 --> 23:48.708
they keep asking me what's
going on between me and you,

23:48.742 --> 23:51.104
and I don't always know
what to tell them.

23:51.124 --> 23:53.698
Oh, and Ty might be
going to jail.

23:53.718 --> 23:56.068
So there's that little thing.

23:56.088 --> 23:57.683
Ty might be going to jail?

23:57.718 --> 24:00.375
There is a
very good possibility.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.279
He beat up Jesse Stanton.

24:03.299 --> 24:04.929
Are you kidding me?

24:04.949 --> 24:07.369
Oh. Hey, come here.

24:08.349 --> 24:11.844
Come here.
Oh...

24:12.706 --> 24:14.400
Okay.

24:14.434 --> 24:17.687
I'm just trying so hard
to keep it together, Peter,

24:17.707 --> 24:20.506
but I... it feels like
no matter what I do,

24:20.526 --> 24:22.688
I just make everyone
around me miserable.

24:22.708 --> 24:24.743
- No, that is not true.
- Yes.

24:24.777 --> 24:27.512
You're just, you know,
sometimes...

24:27.546 --> 24:30.081
you're the bad cop, you know.

24:30.776 --> 24:32.050
The bad cop?

24:32.084 --> 24:34.285
Like when we're trying
to get the kids to bed

24:34.319 --> 24:36.987
and you lay down the law and I
negotiate for an extra hour,

24:37.022 --> 24:38.822
then we end up just giving them
a few extra minutes.

24:38.857 --> 24:41.559
They feel like they've won,
but...

24:41.593 --> 24:43.657
Really, we got them to bed
just on time.

24:45.894 --> 24:48.265
And I come out like the hero and
then you come out looking like...

24:48.299 --> 24:49.800
The wicked witch of the west?

24:49.834 --> 24:53.871
No, no, no. Just the bad cop.

24:53.905 --> 24:57.007
And you're also the planner,
the organizer,

24:57.042 --> 24:59.443
the chief executive in charge

24:59.477 --> 25:03.512
of the entire
Bartlett-Flemming-Morris clan,

25:03.547 --> 25:07.524
and I know that
that is not an easy place to be.

25:08.703 --> 25:11.920
I also know - we all know -

25:11.955 --> 25:14.264
that you are the beating heart
of this whole family, Lou,

25:14.284 --> 25:17.039
and we are so lucky to have you.

26:01.353 --> 26:04.138
Thank you for the breakfast.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.818
Thank you for...
your kind words.

26:11.288 --> 26:13.046
You're welcome.

26:20.092 --> 26:23.127
You're asking me here to plea Ty's case
you're wasting your time.

26:23.537 --> 26:25.795
I came to accept your offer.

26:26.925 --> 26:28.180
What offer's that?

26:28.200 --> 26:30.351
I will work for you
at Briar Ridge,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.245
just like you wanted.

26:32.265 --> 26:35.540
You drop
the charges against Ty.

26:35.574 --> 26:37.207
And you do that, I'm all yours.

26:37.242 --> 26:41.712
At one time, the idea of Amy Fleming
working at Briar Ridge

26:41.747 --> 26:44.214
meant everything
in the world to me.

26:44.892 --> 26:46.383
But not anymore.

26:46.417 --> 26:48.886
Unfortunately,
that offer's expired.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.908
And I'm not dropping
the charges against Ty.

26:51.928 --> 26:53.857
Why are you doing this?

26:53.891 --> 26:57.827
Because the name Stanton used
to mean something in this town.

26:57.862 --> 27:01.097
My father worked himself
to death, literally,

27:01.132 --> 27:02.932
trying to build a strong
business and reputation,

27:02.967 --> 27:05.663
only to have it dismantled
by my incompetent mother

27:05.683 --> 27:07.586
and frivolous sister.

27:07.606 --> 27:09.973
All of this - Hudson -

27:10.007 --> 27:12.942
this used to be Stanton
territory, and it will be again.

27:12.977 --> 27:15.712
I'm simply reclaiming
my birthright.

27:15.746 --> 27:17.449
You're a fool
if you really believe that.

27:21.573 --> 27:25.655
You know,
with a small twist of fate,

27:25.690 --> 27:28.957
you could be marrying me instead
of that nobody Ty Borden.

27:28.992 --> 27:31.427
We really could've been
something together.

27:31.461 --> 27:35.298
That would've never happened.
Never in a million years.

27:35.834 --> 27:37.933
Hey, Amy,

27:38.862 --> 27:40.990
never say never.

27:56.232 --> 27:59.135
Hey... it's okay.

27:59.992 --> 28:02.824
You're all right.

28:02.858 --> 28:06.454
You know... you look a lot
like my horse Phoenix.

28:08.092 --> 28:09.931
His owner wasn't very nice
to him either,

28:09.965 --> 28:13.535
and then he came to Heartland,
and now he's an amazing horse.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.270
You don't like being cooped up
in there, do you?

28:15.304 --> 28:17.038
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.639
Whoa, honey.

28:21.627 --> 28:22.844
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

28:22.878 --> 28:25.012
That guy looks like
he's got a mean streak.

28:25.047 --> 28:27.048
Well, he's probably just
getting used to being at Heartland.

28:27.082 --> 28:30.024
I'm sure deep down, he's a
gentle, well behaved horse.

28:30.044 --> 28:32.953
I'm not so sure about that.

28:32.987 --> 28:35.902
Okay, well, sometimes you
think something's a certain way,

28:35.922 --> 28:37.324
but then something happens

28:37.359 --> 28:39.260
and you realize it's actually
not that way at all,

28:39.294 --> 28:42.663
and what you really wanted
is finally coming true.

28:43.008 --> 28:45.332
I'm not sure I follow you there.

28:46.111 --> 28:47.811
Lou and Peter.

28:48.034 --> 28:49.435
What about them?

28:49.470 --> 28:51.117
Well, everyone thinks
they're breaking up,

28:51.137 --> 28:52.438
but they're not.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.929
They're not?

28:56.123 --> 28:59.484
I don't know what to say. I mean,
none of this sounds like Jesse at all.

28:59.504 --> 29:01.804
Well, he didn't mention
anything to you?

29:01.824 --> 29:06.152
Look, he's...
He's a really smart boy.

29:06.186 --> 29:09.338
He wouldn't be pursing this if he
weren't justified at some level.

29:09.358 --> 29:12.057
Val. Now you know, Ty.

29:12.092 --> 29:16.178
Do you really believe he deserves
to go to jail over this?

29:16.198 --> 29:19.131
If he did attack my son, then...

29:19.896 --> 29:22.589
maybe he should go to jail.

29:23.569 --> 29:25.938
Ty made a mistake, there
is no doubt about that,

29:25.972 --> 29:30.023
but... your son's made
his share of mistakes too.

29:30.043 --> 29:32.211
Hell, we all have.

29:32.245 --> 29:36.248
Now, I know our families haven't
always gotten along, but...

29:36.283 --> 29:40.304
we've always managed to work
out our differences somehow.

29:40.552 --> 29:44.610
Right now,
I'm hoping that you can...

29:44.924 --> 29:49.185
convince Jesse to find
another way to deal with this.

29:51.096 --> 29:54.203
He's pretty stubborn,
just like his father.

29:54.223 --> 29:56.698
Is that so? Like his father?

30:00.611 --> 30:03.374
Okay. Like me too.

30:03.408 --> 30:06.858
So I'm not sure anything I say
will make a difference.

30:06.878 --> 30:10.834
This is important.
Amy and Ty, they...

30:11.690 --> 30:13.539
Well, they...
They've been thinking

30:13.559 --> 30:16.567
they should cancel
this wedding and...

30:18.831 --> 30:21.412
I'm asking you, Val,

30:21.698 --> 30:24.874
please, talk to your son.

30:28.163 --> 30:30.267
Taking back his birthright?

30:30.301 --> 30:32.266
- That's what he said.
- God, what does that even mean?

30:32.286 --> 30:34.537
- I don't know.
- I think I do.

30:34.572 --> 30:36.956
You know that housing development
on the West Side of Hudson?

30:36.976 --> 30:39.142
What, those Tacky McMansions?

30:39.177 --> 30:41.912
Yeah. That used to be ranch land
as far as the eye could see.

30:41.946 --> 30:44.820
And then Val's husband
started lending money

30:44.840 --> 30:46.148
to down-on-their-luck ranchers

30:46.183 --> 30:49.085
and convinced them all
to use their land as collateral.

30:49.119 --> 30:51.388
Oh. And let me guess.
He called in the loans,

30:51.422 --> 30:54.118
took the land,
and then sold it to developers.

30:54.138 --> 30:55.594
He made a fortune.

30:55.614 --> 30:57.494
A lot of people were upset,
but...

30:57.528 --> 31:00.211
then Mr. Stanton died
and everyone just...

31:00.231 --> 31:01.898
kinda forgot about it.

31:01.932 --> 31:04.666
Jesse's picking up where
his old man left off, huh?

31:04.701 --> 31:07.886
Sounds like he doesn't care
who he hurts along the way.

31:12.674 --> 31:15.377
Well, I uh...
I better get going.

31:15.411 --> 31:17.678
I've been wearing these clothes
for two days now.

31:17.713 --> 31:20.397
- I will drive you home.
- Hey!

31:20.782 --> 31:22.189
Hi, dad.

31:22.209 --> 31:24.766
You two made any decisions yet?

31:25.076 --> 31:26.788
No, we haven't.

31:27.235 --> 31:28.623
Well, you better hurry up.

31:28.657 --> 31:31.591
Your honeymoon's gonna end up
being a conjugal visit.

31:33.435 --> 31:36.397
Real nice, dad.

31:36.432 --> 31:39.500
- You staying for dinner?
- No. I gotta get back to Big River.

31:39.535 --> 31:42.403
I just wanted you to know
I heard the good news.

31:42.423 --> 31:43.363
What good news?

31:43.383 --> 31:46.187
That must
have been some lip lock, general.

31:46.207 --> 31:48.600
What're you...
what're you talking about?

31:48.620 --> 31:50.244
You and Peter.

31:50.643 --> 31:53.047
The kiss that you two shared
earlier today.

31:53.081 --> 31:55.911
Georgie thinks
you're getting back together.

31:56.134 --> 31:57.350
So are you?

32:01.422 --> 32:04.182
Amy, I'm really sorry
this is happening.

32:04.629 --> 32:06.726
This is not your fault.

32:06.986 --> 32:10.900
It is my fault. I hit Jesse,

32:10.920 --> 32:13.953
and this is on me,
and now I have to face this.

32:13.973 --> 32:17.833
Any judge is gonna see
right through Jesse.

32:18.479 --> 32:20.923
And what if he doesn't?

32:26.752 --> 32:28.221
Amy, if I'm found guilty,

32:28.241 --> 32:30.554
I'm not gonna graduate
from vet school.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.985
I'll have a criminal record.

32:33.005 --> 32:34.979
And the life that we planned
together...

32:34.999 --> 32:37.795
where you're working
with troubled horses

32:37.815 --> 32:39.321
and I'm fixing
their physical problems -

32:39.341 --> 32:42.841
it can't happen...
Because I won't be a vet.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.177
How can I stand at the altar and
vow to honour and protect you

32:50.197 --> 32:52.890
when I don't even know
if we can be together?

32:57.311 --> 32:59.878
So what're you saying?

32:59.912 --> 33:03.205
I'm saying I think we should
postpone our wedding.

33:13.357 --> 33:15.181
Georgie?

33:15.560 --> 33:18.668
Hey, sweetie, it's-it's early.
Are you feeling okay?

33:18.688 --> 33:21.167
Yeah. I've just got my first
extreme team practice in the m morning,

33:21.187 --> 33:22.732
so I thought
I should get some sleep.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.669
- Oh, that's exciting.
- Yeah, it sure is.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.784
You're gonna be great. You
know, we're real proud of you.

33:27.804 --> 33:30.107
Thanks.

33:30.141 --> 33:33.509
Uh... all right. Good night.

33:33.544 --> 33:36.780
Um, actually,
Georgie, there's um...

33:36.814 --> 33:39.649
There's something
we wanted to talk to you about.

33:40.083 --> 33:41.952
Yeah.

33:42.919 --> 33:44.514
Um...

33:45.457 --> 33:47.057
You see...

33:47.091 --> 33:48.657
Wh-when two people...

33:48.692 --> 33:50.893
Who love each other very much...

33:50.927 --> 33:54.663
And-and have a
long history together...

33:55.308 --> 33:58.882
They... they sometimes... Um...

33:59.303 --> 34:01.073
Is this about the birds
and the bees?

34:01.093 --> 34:04.109
Because I already know
about that stuff.

34:04.129 --> 34:08.677
Um, no, no. That's-that's
not where we're going with this.

34:09.023 --> 34:10.713
Georgie, we know that you
saw us kissing.

34:10.746 --> 34:12.447
And we just-we thought
it was really important

34:12.482 --> 34:15.317
that we explain to you
what happened.

34:15.351 --> 34:17.351
See, your mom and
I have been together

34:17.386 --> 34:20.155
for a really long time
and now that we're separated,

34:20.188 --> 34:22.289
it's... it's a big adjustment
for us.

34:22.309 --> 34:24.726
- Yeah.
- And uh...

34:24.760 --> 34:28.530
sometimes certain feelings
come to the surface.

34:28.563 --> 34:31.699
But just because
those feelings are there,

34:31.734 --> 34:35.237
it doesn't necessarily mean that
we're getting back together.

34:36.223 --> 34:38.344
I know that.

34:38.928 --> 34:40.975
- You do?
- Yeah! I'm not a kid.

34:41.010 --> 34:44.445
I know it's not that simple.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.469
So... you're okay?

34:47.489 --> 34:49.984
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:50.181 --> 34:53.054
Is there... anything else
you wanted to talk about?

34:54.038 --> 34:57.091
No, no.
That's... that's pretty much it.

34:58.605 --> 35:00.127
We love you.

35:00.826 --> 35:02.530
Sleep tight.

35:07.274 --> 35:10.271
See you in the morning.

35:19.861 --> 35:21.363
- There you go.
- Thank you.

35:21.383 --> 35:23.013
You're welcome.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.291
Really mom? Milk?

35:31.325 --> 35:33.402
That's what you always order
when we come here.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.195
Yeah, back when I was twelve.

35:35.229 --> 35:38.357
Oh. Well, I thought since you
were acting like such a child,

35:38.377 --> 35:40.667
it was fitting.

35:41.368 --> 35:43.718
Okay, what's this really about?

35:43.738 --> 35:45.771
Drop the charges against Ty.

35:46.122 --> 35:48.423
You promised when
I took over Briar Ridge

35:48.443 --> 35:50.309
that you wouldn't question
my methods.

35:50.329 --> 35:52.611
Your business methods.

35:52.645 --> 35:55.969
This thing with Ty is nothing
but petty revenge.

35:55.989 --> 35:56.982
It's beneath you.

35:57.017 --> 35:59.443
You know instead of milk,
we should be drinking champagne.

35:59.463 --> 36:01.653
I got the land back from Caleb.

36:01.688 --> 36:03.861
I still have no idea why you gave
them that in the first place.

36:03.881 --> 36:05.636
It was a wedding gift.

36:05.656 --> 36:08.429
Yeah, and now I got it back.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.997
We are one step closer
to continuing dad's legacy.

36:13.017 --> 36:16.286
Jesse, the developers
don't want just the land

36:16.306 --> 36:18.402
the trailer sits on.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.766
You'll need Big River
and a large part of Heartland,

36:20.786 --> 36:22.702
and Jack would never sell
to you.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.810
Why do you think
I'm doing this to Ty?

36:25.845 --> 36:28.153
A few days from the trial,
I'll offer to drop the charges

36:28.173 --> 36:30.581
if they agree to sell.

36:31.152 --> 36:32.683
And you think
that's a good idea?

36:32.703 --> 36:34.252
Yeah, I do.

36:34.286 --> 36:36.815
The Flemings happen
to be my friends.

36:38.657 --> 36:41.325
Look, I know you put
your dad up on a pedestal,

36:41.360 --> 36:44.440
but I never condoned
the way he did business.

36:44.460 --> 36:45.867
You drop those charges!

36:45.887 --> 36:48.139
No, I won't.

36:49.293 --> 36:51.477
This isn't a discussion.

36:51.713 --> 36:53.070
Do as I say,

36:53.104 --> 36:56.110
or I'll come back to Briar
Ridge and take control.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.563
You'll be out looking for a job.

37:01.263 --> 37:03.757
You wouldn't do that.

37:05.793 --> 37:07.944
Let's not ever forget
who's really in charge here,

37:07.964 --> 37:09.379
my dear sweet boy.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.501
Enjoy your milk.

37:18.527 --> 37:20.028
So um...

37:20.779 --> 37:23.131
How do you wanna do this?

37:23.646 --> 37:25.834
I think we should
go in together...

37:25.854 --> 37:28.150
Tell them we're postponing
the wedding.

37:32.349 --> 37:35.761
I have a feeling Lou's
not gonna take this very well.

37:36.096 --> 37:38.062
She'll understand.

37:41.475 --> 37:43.746
Sorry.

37:44.602 --> 37:47.588
It's my lawyer.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.211
Hello?

37:54.345 --> 37:55.909
What?

38:00.190 --> 38:01.679
Are you serious?

38:05.572 --> 38:08.811
Okay. Uh... no. Thank you.

38:10.201 --> 38:12.053
What?

38:12.525 --> 38:14.900
Jesse's dropping the charges.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.588
- He is?
- Yes!

38:16.608 --> 38:19.586
He is?! Oh,
that's so great!

38:20.368 --> 38:21.788
Ty, why... Why did he drop them?

38:21.823 --> 38:24.624
I don't know.
I don't care.

38:25.507 --> 38:27.224
It's over, Amy.

38:27.244 --> 38:28.949
It's over.

38:28.969 --> 38:30.450
I'm not going to jail.

38:30.470 --> 38:32.183
No.

38:36.068 --> 38:39.005
Ty, let's... let's
get married right now.

38:39.025 --> 38:39.709
What?

38:39.729 --> 38:41.807
We have been through
so much over the last few years,

38:41.842 --> 38:44.510
and this is our moment. I don't
wanna wait another minute!

38:44.544 --> 38:46.645
Well... what about the wedding
and the...?

38:46.680 --> 38:50.588
This marriage...
this next step in our life...

38:50.973 --> 38:54.622
this is ours, okay? Just ours.

38:57.548 --> 38:59.526
I know exactly
where we should do it.

39:16.917 --> 39:18.116
Here we are.

39:19.778 --> 39:21.975
Are you nervous?

39:22.546 --> 39:25.770
A little. Mostly just excited.

39:25.790 --> 39:28.360
- Me too.
- Yeah.

39:44.376 --> 39:47.044
I'm not afraid of you.

39:47.079 --> 39:49.413
I'm not afraid of anything.

39:54.595 --> 39:56.444
Get going! Come on!

39:56.464 --> 39:58.922
Come on!

40:16.149 --> 40:19.246
What is your problem?! What?!

40:19.266 --> 40:21.790
So what if you were abandoned?
Who cares?

40:21.810 --> 40:23.847
That's what people do!
They hurt you!

40:23.881 --> 40:26.250
So boo hoo, just... get over it!

40:27.719 --> 40:30.153
Get over it!

40:32.657 --> 40:34.725
Just... just get over it.

40:41.432 --> 40:43.333
You have a note on the fridge.

40:43.367 --> 40:44.834
- A note?
- Mm-hmm.

40:44.868 --> 40:47.170
- From who?
- I'm not sure.

40:52.588 --> 40:54.852
- Oh, it's from Amy.
- What'd she say?

40:54.872 --> 40:57.580
- Jesse dropped the charges!
- Are you serious?!

40:57.615 --> 40:59.845
Now there is some good news!

40:59.865 --> 41:02.265
'Kay, there's more. Uh, they've
gone on a little road trip.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.586
But don't worry, they'll be
back by tomorrow afternoon.

41:04.621 --> 41:06.571
- Where'd they go?
- It doesn't say.

41:06.591 --> 41:08.691
- I'm gonna give Amy a call.
- Oh, Lou, leave 'em be.

41:08.725 --> 41:11.060
They probably wanna celebrate

41:11.094 --> 41:13.729
and it's only until tomorrow.

41:13.764 --> 41:17.032
See? That's probably them
right there.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.637
Yeah, yeah, hello!

41:21.671 --> 41:24.243
Will Vernon!
How the heck are ya?!

41:26.105 --> 41:29.244
You did? Is that so?

41:32.415 --> 41:34.753
How's Katie doing?

41:34.773 --> 41:38.753
Well... I was telling her
about my rodeo days and...

41:38.788 --> 41:40.989
she fell asleep on me.

41:41.023 --> 41:43.524
Hmm...

41:43.958 --> 41:45.894
That... sound,

41:45.928 --> 41:48.163
that sound you just made,

41:48.197 --> 41:50.531
what-what does that mean?
What does that sound mean?

41:50.566 --> 41:53.634
What're you talking about?

41:53.669 --> 41:55.810
It's crazy, never mind.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.873
Are you okay?

42:00.459 --> 42:02.310
Okay...

42:02.344 --> 42:04.712
I wanted to tell you something.

42:04.746 --> 42:06.379
I'm just gonna come out
and say this.

42:06.414 --> 42:08.448
- Okay.
- Dad?

42:08.482 --> 42:10.656
You are not going
to believe this!

42:10.676 --> 42:13.721
- What?
- Well, Jesse dropped the charges.

42:13.755 --> 42:15.288
- That's great.
- Isn't that a good thing?

42:15.323 --> 42:17.024
- Well, yes, it is...
- Yes.

42:17.058 --> 42:20.506
but we just got a call
from Will Vernon.

42:20.526 --> 42:24.353
Now apparently Amy contacted
Joanna just this morning

42:24.373 --> 42:28.768
to see if they could stay at her
place in Pike River for the night.

42:29.527 --> 42:30.644
What's the big deal?

42:30.664 --> 42:34.156
Well, Ty and Amy also asked
Joanna to talk to the minister.

42:36.654 --> 42:38.778
They're eloping!

42:55.325 --> 42:58.074
You must be the young couple
that Joanna was telling me about.

42:58.094 --> 42:59.565
Ty and Amy.

42:59.599 --> 43:01.966
Yes. Hi. Thanks
for doing this.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.502
We really appreciate it,
especially on such short notice.

43:04.522 --> 43:08.413
"Why put off till tomorrow
what you can do today?"

43:08.940 --> 43:13.077
This is my husband.
He'll be acting as your witness.

43:17.849 --> 43:19.716
All right then.
Let's begin.

43:19.751 --> 43:21.919
Are you both ready?
