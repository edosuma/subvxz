<i>The philosopher  Marcel Proust said,</i>

00:52.017 --> 00:54.985
<i> "We say that the hour of
 death cannot be forecast.</i>

00:56.253 --> 01:00.822
<i> But when we say this, we
 imagine that hour to be placed</i>

01:00.824 --> 01:03.658
<i> in an obscure and
 distant future."</i>

01:06.928 --> 01:09.029
<i>We gather here to offer support</i>

01:09.031 --> 01:10.930
<i> to Matthew's family
 and friends.</i>

01:12.198 --> 01:15.433
I must ask now, if your
cell phone is still on,

01:15.435 --> 01:17.601
please turn it off now
to be fully present.

01:24.741 --> 01:26.408
<i> There is never
 a convenient time</i>

01:26.410 --> 01:27.742
<i> for any of us to die.</i>

01:30.045 --> 01:32.780
<i> And yet, how do we
 make sense of such</i>

01:32.782 --> 01:35.415
<i> a promising young man's
 life cut so short?</i>

01:44.589 --> 01:46.590
<i> The eventual
 certainty for us all,</i>

01:47.758 --> 01:49.024
the hour of our death,

01:51.527 --> 01:52.793
suddenly went

01:53.127 --> 01:57.796
from obscure and distant
to a very unreal, reality.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.567
Yet, we are also
here to celebrate

02:02.569 --> 02:03.834
Matthew Burd's life,

02:05.269 --> 02:07.436
and in doing so,
knowing Matthew,

02:08.937 --> 02:12.040
he would want each of you
to live life as he did.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.641
To its fullest.

02:16.744 --> 02:18.511
That if opportunity
presents itself,

02:19.880 --> 02:22.314
do not hesitate, do not waver.

02:23.482 --> 02:25.382
Do not take time for granted.

02:26.884 --> 02:27.984
There is only now.

02:31.822 --> 02:33.087
Holy shit!

02:35.824 --> 02:37.124
Bye, see you later.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.959
You can stay as long as
you like, I'm going to Marie's.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.494
-You goin' there now?
-Mm-hm.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.561
Why?

02:43.563 --> 02:44.962
She asked me to come over.

02:44.964 --> 02:45.829
It's some sort of
family emergency.

02:45.831 --> 02:48.031
What, her family found
out she works at Hooters?

02:48.766 --> 02:50.166
Why do you always
have to put her down?

02:50.467 --> 02:51.600
Maybe it's
because I can't walk

02:51.602 --> 02:53.001
from here to the corner without

02:53.003 --> 02:54.402
running into eight
guys she's fucked.

02:55.804 --> 02:56.970
Bye.

02:57.504 --> 02:59.805
Honey, I was just-- Oh!
Watch the suit, watch the suit.

02:59.807 --> 03:01.773
Just kidding, it's
a joke, come on.

03:01.775 --> 03:03.007
Don't be so serious.

03:04.609 --> 03:05.675
I love you.

03:07.778 --> 03:09.411
-I love you!
-Bye, bye.

03:09.645 --> 03:10.811
Bye, bye!

03:10.813 --> 03:12.546
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye!

03:17.785 --> 03:19.685
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:24.790 --> 03:25.890
Yo!

03:26.091 --> 03:27.191
Hey.

03:27.525 --> 03:28.691
What's up?

03:28.693 --> 03:29.925
What's up?

03:29.927 --> 03:31.259
I ordered you a drink.

03:31.261 --> 03:32.860
Good, I need one.

03:33.161 --> 03:35.662
-Coming.
-Hey, Zach.

03:35.963 --> 03:37.530
-Hey, Bryce!
-What's up, man?

03:37.532 --> 03:38.664
How's it goin'?

03:38.666 --> 03:39.631
All right, how long's it been?

03:39.633 --> 03:40.832
It's been a while.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.533
-You look good.
-Thank you.

03:42.535 --> 03:43.800
Thank you. You too.

03:43.802 --> 03:44.901
There you go.

03:45.335 --> 03:46.568
Can we get another round
when you get a chance?

03:46.802 --> 03:47.902
You bet, and there's
your Coke, honey.

03:48.370 --> 03:49.503
Thanks, Stacey.

03:50.037 --> 03:51.170
Coke?

03:51.471 --> 03:52.871
Twenty-two days sober.

03:53.339 --> 03:54.505
No shit?

03:54.507 --> 03:55.572
Yeah.

03:55.973 --> 03:57.106
You know that line
between being a drinker

03:57.108 --> 03:58.507
and being an alcoholic?

03:58.509 --> 03:59.608
Mm-hm.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.009
He crossed it.

04:01.011 --> 04:02.110
I crossed the shit
out of that line.

04:03.179 --> 04:04.278
Wow, sorry to hear that, man.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.579
No. Hey, it's cool. I'm good.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.213
So I hear congratulations
are in order?

04:07.215 --> 04:08.280
You're getting married.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.314
I'm getting married.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.348
Wow.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.416
Yes.
How 'bout you?

04:12.950 --> 04:14.483
No, no, I've
been seeing someone

04:14.485 --> 04:16.418
off and on,
but nothing serious.

04:16.652 --> 04:18.152
-To Matthew.
-Yep.

04:18.154 --> 04:19.253
To Matt.

04:20.488 --> 04:21.588
Can't believe he's dead.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.024
Getting run over by a
bus in broad daylight?

04:25.325 --> 04:26.458
What are the odds?

04:26.959 --> 04:28.459
When it's your time,
it's your time.

04:29.127 --> 04:30.393
That's life,
one minute you're walking

04:30.395 --> 04:32.661
down the street,
next minute-- Bam!

04:32.663 --> 04:34.496
Pulling your skull
fragments outta

04:34.498 --> 04:36.431
the front grill
of the city bus.

04:36.799 --> 04:38.966
I'm not so sure that
it was an accident.

04:40.902 --> 04:42.102
What the fuck does that mean?

04:42.837 --> 04:45.104
Well, Matthew called
me a couple weeks ago.

04:46.072 --> 04:48.973
He was depressed,
he was incoherent.

04:49.207 --> 04:50.874
And he thought he
was being followed.

04:51.342 --> 04:52.575
You know what,
and then he told me

04:52.809 --> 04:54.242
he had been outta
work since January,

04:54.476 --> 04:55.876
and that he was flat broke now.

04:56.143 --> 04:57.810
So, anyway, Matt's getting
harassed by creditors.

04:58.178 --> 04:59.511
So he asks you for money.

04:59.513 --> 05:00.912
No, no, he knows
I don't have it.

05:01.580 --> 05:02.780
Look.

05:03.248 --> 05:06.183
All I'm suggesting is that,
it wouldn't surprise me

05:06.185 --> 05:08.084
if a suicide note turned up.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.419
What was that?
-Shit.

05:12.421 --> 05:13.420
Ah, shit, is that Noah Dorfman?

05:13.422 --> 05:14.654
Scared the shit outta me.

05:14.656 --> 05:15.855
Did you
invite him here?

05:15.857 --> 05:16.989
He cornered me
at the services.

05:17.523 --> 05:18.689
Why didn't you invite
the whole goddamn funeral?

05:18.691 --> 05:20.524
Bryce! Hey, man!

05:20.526 --> 05:22.592
-Hey! Ah-ha!
-How you doin'?

05:22.594 --> 05:24.160
-All right, all right.
-Good to see you, Warren.

05:24.162 --> 05:25.594
-Hey, man.
-Good to see you again.

05:25.596 --> 05:26.695
-Yeah, yeah.
-Hey!

05:26.697 --> 05:28.063
-Hey!
-Come here, buddy.

05:28.065 --> 05:29.831
Poodles! How you doin'?

05:30.399 --> 05:31.599
-Are you good?
-Long time.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.099
That's a nice
fuckin' watch, man.

05:33.101 --> 05:34.733
Thanks, man,
that was my dad's, yeah.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.301
Lucky sperm club, huh?

05:36.535 --> 05:38.702
It has been a long time!

05:38.704 --> 05:40.670
Hey, make sure I get
all of your e-mails.

05:40.672 --> 05:42.171
I'm on the reunion
planning committee!

05:42.173 --> 05:44.239
I'm in charge of
tracking everyone down.

05:44.241 --> 05:45.773
-Reunion?
-Yeah!

05:45.775 --> 05:47.107
That's in-- You know
that's in three years?

05:47.109 --> 05:48.374
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

05:48.376 --> 05:50.275
Yeah, you know, but, you know,

05:50.277 --> 05:52.210
but my New Year's
resolution was

05:52.212 --> 05:54.078
no more putting off till
tomorrow what you can do today.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.779
True.
-That and buy a Stair Master.

05:55.781 --> 05:57.413
-New Year's resolution?
-Yeah.

05:57.415 --> 05:58.447
It's like, October, Noah.

06:00.884 --> 06:02.216
Time flies.

06:02.218 --> 06:03.350
What have you
been doing though,

06:03.718 --> 06:05.251
other than planning the
reunion for three years?

06:05.253 --> 06:07.253
Well, uh, I am in real estate.

06:07.255 --> 06:08.487
Real estate!

06:08.855 --> 06:10.355
Yeah, yeah, let me
give you a card, you know.

06:11.690 --> 06:14.258
Of course, in this market you
can't give shit away, but...

06:14.260 --> 06:16.260
Is that your sales pitch?

06:16.262 --> 06:17.527
'Cause you got me.

06:18.028 --> 06:20.029
I hear you're gettin'
married Zach, congrats.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.363
Man, I got some great listings,

06:21.564 --> 06:22.363
great neighborhoods
for starting a family,

06:22.365 --> 06:23.497
that kinda thing.

06:23.898 --> 06:25.531
Yeah, I'm good, Noah.

06:26.566 --> 06:28.600
So what about you,
you got a girl, or...?

06:28.602 --> 06:29.634
You know, I do actually.

06:29.636 --> 06:30.801
Yeah? Oh, good.

06:31.402 --> 06:32.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's getting
pretty serious actually.

06:32.771 --> 06:33.770
It's true what
they say, you know,

06:33.772 --> 06:35.772
there's someone out there
for everyone, even him.

06:36.908 --> 06:38.274
Even you, even you!

06:38.742 --> 06:40.008
Even you, come on!

06:40.275 --> 06:41.441
I feel like we're in
high school right now.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.875
Right now, at this moment.

06:44.777 --> 06:46.144
I bet your rich
daddy's gonna throw you

06:46.146 --> 06:47.311
one hell of a wedding.

06:47.712 --> 06:49.145
Well, uh...

06:49.479 --> 06:52.013
He passed, actually,
uh, blood clots.

06:52.247 --> 06:53.247
Sorry to hear that.

06:53.249 --> 06:54.414
That sucks, man, sorry.

06:54.416 --> 06:55.615
Thanks guys, thank you, yeah.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.650
Yeah.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.485
And he was worth a lot
of money, your father.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.720
You know, I mean
dealing with lawyers

07:01.722 --> 07:02.854
and the estate,
that's a big headache.

07:03.155 --> 07:04.455
You know, you're spot on about

07:04.656 --> 07:06.223
the real estate market,
I say the same thing

07:06.225 --> 07:07.557
to all my clients when
they come in, I say,

07:07.559 --> 07:08.991
"Until things turn around,

07:08.993 --> 07:10.993
avoid it
like the fuckin' plague."

07:11.427 --> 07:13.928
The smart money right now
is in portfolio management.

07:13.930 --> 07:15.496
-Is that right?
-I want you to take my card.

07:15.498 --> 07:17.231
Look at that.
Oh, man, that is a card.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.465
I want you to call me.

07:18.632 --> 07:19.832
Well, thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.633
-You gonna call me?
-Sure.

07:21.635 --> 07:22.900
All right, I'm gonna
get outta here.

07:22.902 --> 07:24.234
Oh.
I got another round coming.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.635
I'm hydrated, I gotta go.

07:25.637 --> 07:27.737
Listen, if you, uh,
if you don't want

07:27.739 --> 07:29.972
any more to drink,
you know maybe umm,

07:30.807 --> 07:33.341
you guys wanna smoke outside?
A little four-twenty?

07:41.683 --> 07:43.116
Truth is, the
most prevalent thing

07:43.118 --> 07:44.984
that came out of
a day like today is:

07:44.986 --> 07:47.152
at any moment,
that could have been

07:47.154 --> 07:49.020
any one of us in that pine box.

07:49.788 --> 07:50.854
Yeah, man.

07:51.622 --> 07:53.489
That's why you have
to live in the moment.

07:53.957 --> 07:56.591
Like that preacher said, if the
opportunity presents itself,

07:58.093 --> 07:59.593
do not hesitate.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.295
Amen to that, my brother.

08:03.665 --> 08:05.364
Hey, you guys ever
hear of Bidexco?

08:05.832 --> 08:06.998
Bidexco?

08:07.299 --> 08:09.333
Yeah, it's a
pharmaceutical company,

08:09.335 --> 08:11.168
small startup, some
guys at my firm,

08:11.170 --> 08:12.502
we helped them raise capital.

08:12.504 --> 08:14.270
Why are you asking
about Bidexco?

08:14.272 --> 08:15.504
Well, my cousin works for this

08:15.506 --> 08:17.372
large accounting firm,
you know,

08:17.374 --> 08:20.208
too large to take Bidexco
on as a client, so,

08:20.210 --> 08:21.609
he helps them out
on the weekends

08:21.611 --> 08:23.677
and they put all
their cash right back

08:23.679 --> 08:25.545
into research so
instead of paying him,

08:25.547 --> 08:27.547
they just issue him stock.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.015
I hate to break
it to your buddy,

08:29.017 --> 08:30.616
but, uh, you should
tell him it's probably

08:30.618 --> 08:32.284
not worth the paper
it's written on.

08:33.152 --> 08:34.418
Well, maybe.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.355
Or maybe he overheard
a researcher talking.

08:38.789 --> 08:39.955
About a breakthrough.

08:40.489 --> 08:42.089
A month before FDA approval.

08:42.490 --> 08:43.722
And since he'd
been doing all this

08:43.957 --> 08:45.857
under the table, he
put all the shares

08:45.859 --> 08:48.125
in this account, in
this trust account,

08:48.127 --> 08:49.593
under a fictitious name.

08:50.127 --> 08:51.460
And now he's
starting to freak out

08:51.462 --> 08:52.928
and he wants
to sell the shares.

08:53.195 --> 08:54.395
What's he asking?

08:54.896 --> 08:56.529
Two hundred grand. Cash.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.363
Oh, is that all?

08:58.365 --> 08:59.697
Yeah, why?

09:00.065 --> 09:02.166
If what he says is
true about that stock,

09:02.168 --> 09:03.834
it could be worth 10
times that tomorrow,

09:03.836 --> 09:05.869
maybe even more, the
sky's the fucking limit.

09:05.871 --> 09:07.370
My rent check
clears this month,

09:07.537 --> 09:10.071
my account holds a little
over 300 dollars, so.

09:11.139 --> 09:12.873
Well, everything I got
is tied up in investments

09:12.875 --> 09:15.542
right now, I'm not
really a liquid...

09:15.544 --> 09:17.610
You know, I can't get my
hands on that type of cash.

09:19.479 --> 09:21.880
Well, I could, I could get it.

09:21.882 --> 09:23.047
You could get what?

09:23.049 --> 09:24.648
The money. I can get it.

09:24.650 --> 09:26.116
- You can get the money?
- Sure.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.550
How much of it?

09:27.751 --> 09:28.917
I can get--
I can get all of it.

09:30.052 --> 09:31.252
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:31.254 --> 09:32.519
Want some more of this?

09:32.521 --> 09:33.853
Thank you.

09:33.855 --> 09:35.120
Um, you know of
course, if everyone

09:35.521 --> 09:38.055
wants in, we'd have to split
it four ways, you know?

09:38.689 --> 09:41.223
Um, that way we,
you know, would be,

09:41.225 --> 09:43.124
equal partners, you know?

09:43.992 --> 09:46.393
Uh. On principal
whatever you pay back,

09:46.395 --> 09:48.061
plus some accrued interest,
but,

09:48.063 --> 09:51.330
you know, this, I mean this
is how it works, right?

09:51.332 --> 09:52.397
You know?

09:53.065 --> 09:56.333
We can, like, uh, be the
Four Amigos or something.

09:56.734 --> 09:57.834
With business.

10:00.270 --> 10:01.403
Oh, wait, it was three.

10:02.838 --> 10:04.004
Four Musketeers.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.907
Let's sign a treaty!

10:09.541 --> 10:10.574
I like this!

10:13.211 --> 10:14.310
It's a great tip.

10:14.577 --> 10:15.743
I'm starting to
feel a sensation here.

10:27.086 --> 10:28.252
This is Zach.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.920
Warren, what's up?

10:31.621 --> 10:33.355
What, no, I'm at work.

10:36.192 --> 10:37.325
What?

10:38.226 --> 10:39.326
What channel?

10:41.262 --> 10:43.229
<i> Hours after
 the SEC seized hard drives</i>

10:43.231 --> 10:45.864
<i> from its corporate offices,
 its chief executive officer,</i>

10:45.866 --> 10:48.533
<i> Peter Nelson, was apprehended.</i>

10:48.535 --> 10:51.068
<i> It seems Bidexco, a startup
 pharmaceutical company</i>

10:51.070 --> 10:53.703
<i> was under heavy surveillance
 by federal authorities</i>

10:53.705 --> 10:55.538
<i> for the past six months.</i>

10:56.106 --> 10:58.140
<i> It's unclear whether
 Peter Nelson acted alone,</i>

10:58.142 --> 11:00.342
<i> or if Bidexco's executives--</i>

11:00.810 --> 11:02.243
Uh, yeah, Warren.
I think this means

11:02.245 --> 11:04.178
our shares are
fucking worthless!

11:07.615 --> 11:09.582
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

11:09.584 --> 11:10.749
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

11:10.751 --> 11:11.816
Fuck! Fuck!

11:11.818 --> 11:13.884
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

11:13.886 --> 11:15.652
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

11:15.654 --> 11:17.220
How many different
ways you want me

11:17.222 --> 11:18.788
to say we got fucked, Warren?

11:18.790 --> 11:20.790
The stock has no value!

11:21.892 --> 11:24.693
The CFO just got
arrested by the Feds!

11:26.295 --> 11:27.461
You know what, I can't--

11:27.463 --> 11:28.728
Hey, what?

11:29.262 --> 11:30.895
What? Hey!

11:30.897 --> 11:33.163
Jesus, what the fuck's
going on? Listen!

11:33.165 --> 11:34.330
Listen, listen!

11:46.007 --> 11:47.240
Hey. How ya doin'?

11:47.908 --> 11:48.974
Hey, guys, I don't--

11:48.976 --> 11:50.108
-Mike.
-Just--

11:53.645 --> 11:55.779
Now, if you don't want
to repeat this exercise,

11:55.781 --> 11:58.347
you'll keep your mouth shut,
and let me do the talking.

11:59.615 --> 12:00.648
Let me be brief.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.016
You and your partners borrowed

12:02.283 --> 12:03.983
a substantial amount of
money from my benefactor.

12:03.985 --> 12:05.651
And in light of recent
events, he's concerned

12:05.653 --> 12:07.085
about getting paid back.

12:07.087 --> 12:08.820
Which is understandable.

12:08.822 --> 12:12.423
He wants a sit-down, tomorrow,
the Royale, three o'clock.

12:12.957 --> 12:14.090
That's it.

12:14.491 --> 12:15.924
Uh. Oh, and don't forget
to bring your buddies.

12:15.926 --> 12:17.058
Little Mike.

12:39.378 --> 12:40.478
Where is he?

12:40.480 --> 12:41.679
Fuck if I know!

12:41.681 --> 12:42.680
He said three o'clock.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.014
Are you sure he said three?

12:44.348 --> 12:45.781
I'm pretty sure he said
three o'clock, Warren, yeah.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.182
Considering I was thrown
in the back of a fucking trunk.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.516
Couldn't wear a nice shirt?

12:49.518 --> 12:50.617
I just got off work.

12:50.619 --> 12:52.619
If you need to borrow a fucking
shirt, you can ask me.

12:52.621 --> 12:53.419
I do not want to--

12:53.421 --> 12:55.354
Are you sure he said he wanted
to talk to all of us?

12:55.655 --> 12:56.821
Actually he said
he wanted to talk

12:56.823 --> 12:58.122
to everyone but the black guy.

12:58.124 --> 12:59.990
Yes!
He wants to talk to all of us!

12:59.992 --> 13:01.257
Real fucking cute, Zach.

13:02.025 --> 13:03.959
Noah, what the fuck
did you get us into?

13:04.193 --> 13:06.561
Guys, you asked me to get
the fucking money, I fucking--

13:06.563 --> 13:08.062
We thought you had
the fucking money!

13:08.064 --> 13:09.730
What the fuck are
you talking about?

13:09.732 --> 13:11.231
Did you bury it with
your fucking father?

13:11.398 --> 13:12.431
Oh, gee, "Hey, Noah, thanks
for getting the money--

13:12.832 --> 13:14.132
Shut the fuck up.
I swear to you...

13:19.337 --> 13:21.371
- Would you sit down?
- Shut the fuck up!

13:21.373 --> 13:22.905
Who did you borrow
this money from?

13:23.506 --> 13:24.572
Huh?

13:56.037 --> 13:57.070
Hey, Eddie.

13:57.072 --> 13:59.005
Paula, hold up there.

13:59.740 --> 14:00.873
How you doin'?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.374
It's not as bad as it looks.

14:02.376 --> 14:03.441
What happened?

14:03.708 --> 14:06.009
I, uh, fell down
a flight of stairs.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.043
Really?

14:07.045 --> 14:08.577
You know how clumsy I am.

14:09.912 --> 14:11.579
Still with the mechanic, huh?

14:11.581 --> 14:13.080
Eddie it was my fault, it was,

14:13.082 --> 14:15.916
I screwed up,
it was all my fault.

14:15.918 --> 14:17.250
I gotta get back to work.

14:17.252 --> 14:18.684
-Okay, okay.
-Good seeing you, Eddie.

14:18.686 --> 14:19.785
Yeah, you too.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.986
They here?

14:22.354 --> 14:23.654
They're here, at your table.

14:32.563 --> 14:33.663
Yeah, that's him.

14:34.031 --> 14:36.364
Oh, guys, I am so
sorry I'm late, traffic.

14:38.266 --> 14:40.867
Ah, yes, kale shake.

14:40.869 --> 14:43.169
Dehydrated cactus powder.

14:43.737 --> 14:45.370
I'm training for a 5K.

14:47.606 --> 14:48.772
Hello, Noah.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.773
Mr. Lovato.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.608
Eddie. Come on, we're in
business together.

14:53.610 --> 14:54.709
Huh?

14:56.445 --> 14:57.778
I think it's appropriate to be

14:57.780 --> 14:59.012
on a first-name
basis, don't you?

14:59.413 --> 15:00.446
Yeah.

15:00.448 --> 15:01.613
So, how are you?

15:04.950 --> 15:06.116
Good?

15:06.450 --> 15:07.983
Good.

15:08.217 --> 15:10.818
You boys ever hear of the
seven rules of economics?

15:12.253 --> 15:13.319
That's okay.

15:13.753 --> 15:15.620
Basically there's seven
fundamental notions,

15:15.622 --> 15:17.788
let's say, that reflect
how our economy operates.

15:18.122 --> 15:20.957
There's scarcity,
there's subjectivity,

15:20.959 --> 15:26.028
there's inequality,
competition, imperfection,

15:26.429 --> 15:28.496
ignorance and complexity.

15:29.130 --> 15:30.730
But I believe there are eight.

15:30.732 --> 15:31.964
Luck.

15:31.966 --> 15:33.298
Which as of yesterday morning,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.899
you boys seem shit out of.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.868
Because as of today,
you owe me 400 grand.

15:39.135 --> 15:41.136
Uh. The number was 200.

15:41.138 --> 15:42.637
Ah, you forget
the cost of money.

15:43.238 --> 15:45.906
Which is a theory, another
basic fundamental rule.

15:45.908 --> 15:47.507
With all due
respect, sir, we didn't

15:47.509 --> 15:50.176
borrow the money
from you, Noah did.

15:50.644 --> 15:51.744
Noah.

15:51.746 --> 15:53.212
Are these your partners?

15:53.980 --> 15:56.715
Yes, yes they are.

15:56.949 --> 15:58.983
Well, then, you share
the debt equally.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.852
-Mr. Lovato--
-No, Eddie. Eddie, please.

16:02.854 --> 16:03.919
Eddie.

16:04.620 --> 16:06.153
Can I ask you a
question, and I mean this

16:06.155 --> 16:07.354
with all due respect.

16:07.356 --> 16:08.588
Sure.

16:09.790 --> 16:12.724
Are you, you know...?

16:14.093 --> 16:15.259
Am I what?

16:17.962 --> 16:19.562
Am I Italian? Yes.

16:20.697 --> 16:21.863
What are you getting at?

16:22.464 --> 16:23.564
Am I...?

16:24.165 --> 16:26.166
-You know--
-Oh, am I this?

16:27.701 --> 16:29.468
Noah, you borrowed money
from the fucking mob?

16:29.470 --> 16:30.936
It's one of your
New Year's resolutions, Noah,

16:30.938 --> 16:32.504
become a complete
fucking moron?

16:32.506 --> 16:33.771
What do you mean
become a moron,

16:33.773 --> 16:35.005
he's always been
a fucking moron.

16:35.373 --> 16:37.640
I am with ya, I swear, and
a guy I know referred me

16:37.642 --> 16:39.541
and he borrowed money,
he had no problem.

16:39.543 --> 16:40.842
- Noah.
- Yes.

16:40.844 --> 16:42.143
Did he pay it back?

16:42.145 --> 16:43.677
Yes. Yes, he did.

16:43.679 --> 16:44.844
Okay.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.047
Fucking idiot!

16:48.214 --> 16:49.447
Why am I the only one
catching blame here?

16:49.449 --> 16:51.182
-Yell at Bryce's cousin!
-Fuck!

16:51.184 --> 16:53.150
He didn't borrow money
from the fucking mob!

16:53.152 --> 16:54.351
Hey, hey, hey!

16:54.353 --> 16:55.552
You guys. Shh!

16:55.554 --> 16:56.886
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

16:58.288 --> 16:59.421
Relax.

17:01.123 --> 17:02.790
Okay, all right,
this is the deal.

17:03.324 --> 17:05.625
My sister's husband,
Buddy, that's his name,

17:05.892 --> 17:08.059
not the brightest bulb
in the lamp store, okay?

17:08.359 --> 17:11.060
He got a cocaine habit,
my sister didn't know it,

17:11.063 --> 17:12.529
nobody knew.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.796
And I don't blame
her, I mean, you know,

17:13.798 --> 17:15.696
she's in love and she,
you know,

17:15.699 --> 17:17.598
sometimes you don't
see the warning signs.

17:18.532 --> 17:21.034
But this habit, you
know, it went from like

17:21.036 --> 17:24.069
a few lines a week to
2,000 dollars a day.

17:24.704 --> 17:26.503
And he runs a forklift, okay,

17:26.506 --> 17:28.137
so he's not exactly
Warren Buffet.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.439
Right?

17:29.873 --> 17:31.506
So now he builds up a
hefty tab to the source,

17:31.508 --> 17:33.808
who's tired of looking in
the mouth for his check,

17:33.810 --> 17:37.277
and now the source is looking
to collect on what he's owed.

17:37.511 --> 17:39.211
So, he kidnapped my niece.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.981
And because of this
world-class degenerate,

17:42.983 --> 17:45.650
in my opinion, my baby
niece's safe return

17:45.652 --> 17:47.885
is of the utmost
importance to me,

17:47.887 --> 17:49.786
is being held in
lieu of payment.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.888
So why don't you
just pay off the debt?

17:52.890 --> 17:55.223
Oh, normally that would be the
standard operating procedure.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.926
This dealer, this fucking,
Tyrone is his name.

18:00.395 --> 18:01.695
<i> Got a chip on his shoulder.</i>

18:01.697 --> 18:03.430
Now he wants Buddy
for my niece.

18:03.864 --> 18:06.098
Okay, just to make
some sort of example.

18:06.999 --> 18:09.767
The problem is, uh,
Buddy is MIA,

18:10.502 --> 18:12.669
which is
where you guys come in.

18:12.671 --> 18:13.770
How?

18:13.772 --> 18:15.471
Well, Tyrone's got a brother.

18:16.706 --> 18:17.972
<i> From what I understand,
 he's not gonna</i>

18:18.206 --> 18:20.040
be up for Citizen of
the Year Award, either,

18:20.042 --> 18:22.409
so you won't have
an ethics problem,

18:22.411 --> 18:23.943
because you're all
men of principle,

18:23.945 --> 18:25.644
when you go to
pick him up for me.

18:26.746 --> 18:27.946
Pick...

18:29.348 --> 18:30.381
Mr. Lovato--

18:30.383 --> 18:31.849
No, Eddie, Eddie, please.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.650
Eddie.

18:34.918 --> 18:37.452
I'm sorry to hear about
your niece, we all are.

18:37.454 --> 18:39.020
I mean that's horrible.

18:39.022 --> 18:40.621
But we're not criminals.

18:40.623 --> 18:41.922
We don't know the
first thing about

18:41.924 --> 18:43.356
kidnapping someone.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.759
I mean, look at Noah, I mean...

18:48.028 --> 18:49.760
Besides why wouldn't
you just have...

18:51.863 --> 18:52.996
Them handle it.

18:53.297 --> 18:54.864
Well, that would require
a two-part answer.

18:54.866 --> 18:57.199
One, which is of no
concern of yours.

18:57.433 --> 19:00.334
They'll be busy looking for
Tyrone to set up the exchange.

19:00.568 --> 19:03.536
And two, and this is head and
shoulders above the first.

19:03.770 --> 19:07.038
They don't owe me 400
fucking thousand dollars!

19:07.040 --> 19:09.974
And unlike a bank, there
will be no late slips.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.212
So say we pick
him up, then what?

19:16.214 --> 19:17.313
Zach, are you
fucking kidding me?

19:17.315 --> 19:18.947
I'm not kidnapping anybody!

19:18.949 --> 19:20.048
Me neither.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.215
I'd be a liability.

19:21.649 --> 19:23.149
We have no fucking
choice, he's not asking us.

19:23.151 --> 19:24.383
We're classically
fucked no matter

19:24.385 --> 19:25.917
which direction we look in.

19:25.919 --> 19:27.184
Quantum physics.

19:27.385 --> 19:28.485
Did you ever hear
of the Quantum Ten?

19:29.119 --> 19:30.285
Group of guys,
they got together,

19:30.287 --> 19:32.053
fired by ambition and passion.

19:32.788 --> 19:34.555
They created quantum physics.

19:35.490 --> 19:37.891
They knew with
ambition and passion

19:37.893 --> 19:39.192
comes execution.

19:40.661 --> 19:41.994
Fuck.

19:41.996 --> 19:43.829
I'm shitting green,
and then running

19:43.831 --> 19:46.364
three times a day, 'cause I
know what it's like to execute.

19:47.132 --> 19:48.932
Okay?
I know what it takes.

19:48.934 --> 19:50.099
It takes motivation.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.366
And you guys have plenty of it.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.700
I'm offering you
gentlemen a way out.

19:54.334 --> 19:56.635
I'm offering you a
panacea to your problems.

19:58.805 --> 20:03.240
All you have to do is collect
him, hold him, for 24 hours.

20:03.608 --> 20:05.442
My guys'll hunt down
Tyrone, they'll set

20:05.444 --> 20:08.578
a time and place,
I'll contact you, okay.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.680
We exchange my niece
for his brother.

20:11.314 --> 20:14.983
And if you do this for me,
I will consider the slate clean.

20:19.654 --> 20:20.854
I hate this shit.

20:23.791 --> 20:26.258
It's like wheat grass, but it's
not as good as wheat grass.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.760
<i> Hey, Bernard,
 lemme tell you though,</i>

20:29.994 --> 20:31.194
<i> Let me tell you what this
 motherfucker said to me</i>

20:31.662 --> 20:33.095
<i> That if I don't give
 him my club seats</i>

20:33.329 --> 20:34.929
<i> to the Indians game
 this Saturday night,</i>

20:34.931 --> 20:35.930
<i> he will tell his
 little sister about</i>

20:35.932 --> 20:37.131
<i> what I did last weekend.</i>

20:37.133 --> 20:38.665
<i> What about it?</i>

20:38.667 --> 20:40.299
<i> Well you know, I ended up with</i>

20:40.301 --> 20:41.867
<i> that redhead chick
 from Lakeview.</i>

20:41.869 --> 20:43.168
Give him
the fucking tickets, man.

20:43.502 --> 20:45.636
<i> Man, fuck no!
 Mastiff is pitching!</i>

20:45.638 --> 20:47.170
All right, we'll tell
him that if he don't

20:47.172 --> 20:49.205
back off, then you'll
break his elbows.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.273
Man, I can't do that man,
he's still my brother in-law.

20:51.507 --> 20:53.274
Besides, the nigga so
dumb, he shit in his own hat.

20:53.276 --> 20:55.142
By the third drink he
forgot his own name.

20:56.778 --> 20:58.677
Look, man, he can't
open up his mouth,

20:58.679 --> 21:00.845
because if he do, I
spend now until eternity

21:00.847 --> 21:02.079
in Lawyer Land.

21:02.447 --> 21:03.980
Ah, shit, man.

21:03.982 --> 21:05.948
Hey, Marques,
what would you do?

21:07.517 --> 21:10.452
First off, I wouldn't
be stupid enough

21:10.454 --> 21:12.887
to cheat on my wife.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.389
And then advertise that shit to

21:15.391 --> 21:17.691
half the fucking neighborhood.

21:18.559 --> 21:19.692
Nigga.

21:20.727 --> 21:22.728
You might as well
have posted fliers.

21:23.296 --> 21:25.196
Aight, I'll be the
grown-up and say

21:25.198 --> 21:27.064
what's on all y'all niggas
minds at this table.

21:27.066 --> 21:28.799
You all mouth, Lamont.

21:30.168 --> 21:31.535
That's your problem.

21:32.036 --> 21:33.369
And we can't afford
to be havin'

21:33.371 --> 21:35.104
no soft-ass niggas
in this crew.

21:36.039 --> 21:37.539
In case you gentlemen
have forgotten,

21:37.541 --> 21:39.507
that is the protocol
to our industry.

21:39.509 --> 21:41.375
You wanna climb the
corporate ladder?

21:41.377 --> 21:43.243
Keep you mouth--
fuckin' mouth shut!

21:44.311 --> 21:46.979
<i> And, unfortunately,
 we got a zero-tolerance</i>

21:46.981 --> 21:48.480
<i> policy, my nigga.</i>

21:54.386 --> 21:56.153
Lamont, I'm just
fuckin' wit' you.

22:01.091 --> 22:02.558
You cold, man!

22:03.159 --> 22:04.726
Cold, man!

22:43.932 --> 22:46.099
Hey, this stall's
taken, motherfucker.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.704
Get him!

22:58.376 --> 22:59.709
Grab his fucking arm!

22:59.711 --> 23:01.944
Fuck off!
Fuck off!

23:10.119 --> 23:11.652
Grab the fucker's arm!

23:20.225 --> 23:21.857
Hit him!
Hit him!

23:27.996 --> 23:29.329
Man, go check on Marques!

23:29.730 --> 23:31.130
Nah, man, fuck that, you go.

23:31.132 --> 23:32.498
Marques!

23:32.500 --> 23:33.799
One of y'all motherfuckers go!

23:35.968 --> 23:37.534
Hurry up, hurry up!

23:40.337 --> 23:41.704
Open up!

23:43.139 --> 23:44.806
All right, he's in, he's in.
Go, go, go!

23:44.808 --> 23:47.141
Go, go, go!

23:48.177 --> 23:49.543
Go you fucking idiot!

23:53.314 --> 23:54.546
Jesus Christ!

23:54.780 --> 23:56.013
Christ! Do you know how
to fucking drive!

23:56.015 --> 23:57.314
It's a junky piece of shit!

24:01.852 --> 24:03.185
Are you fucking hit?

24:03.786 --> 24:05.620
Go, go!
Go, go, go!

24:05.622 --> 24:06.954
Jesus Christ!

24:06.956 --> 24:08.522
Jesus, get the fuck
off my foot!

24:09.858 --> 24:11.490
We're taking this car too fast!

24:21.366 --> 24:22.966
Who in the heck was that?

24:22.968 --> 24:24.300
I don't know.

24:24.302 --> 24:26.268
Whoever it was,
they were professionals.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.104
Jesus Christ, Coleman.

24:29.106 --> 24:30.171
My bad!

25:07.875 --> 25:08.975
Guys?

25:12.479 --> 25:13.579
Guys!

25:24.057 --> 25:25.524
What the hell is this?

25:25.526 --> 25:26.725
That's on a
need-to-know basis.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.492
Right now you don't
need to know shit.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.826
Who the fuck are you?

25:30.360 --> 25:32.060
Don't worry
about all that, Marques.

25:32.062 --> 25:34.562
This'll all be over in 24 hours,
as long as you behave.

25:38.734 --> 25:40.100
Behave?

25:41.569 --> 25:43.636
You got a set of stones,
I'll give you that.

25:47.239 --> 25:48.339
Where the fuck am I?

25:48.840 --> 25:50.240
It's like an old warehouse.

25:50.541 --> 25:52.742
And artists live, work,
subsidize rental arrangement,

25:52.744 --> 25:54.710
my company has the listing.

25:54.712 --> 25:55.811
Shut up!

25:56.612 --> 25:58.579
You're a fucking
real estate agent?

25:59.047 --> 26:00.814
No, ah, no.

26:01.682 --> 26:02.948
Whoa!

26:03.182 --> 26:04.448
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Don't get stupid!

26:04.450 --> 26:05.715
Hey, hey, be easy,
I'm just trying

26:05.717 --> 26:07.349
to get comfortable here.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.183
Just put the--

26:10.251 --> 26:12.352
Oh, for fuck's sake,
is that my gun?

26:15.456 --> 26:18.958
I mean, it's bad enough
I get jacked by the local

26:18.960 --> 26:20.592
neighborhood watch,
but now you're gonna

26:20.594 --> 26:22.760
point my own fucking
pistol at me?

26:22.762 --> 26:24.094
Being that it's
yours, we certainly

26:24.295 --> 26:25.862
don't have to remind
you that it's loaded.

26:28.599 --> 26:29.932
Can you bring it closer?

26:29.934 --> 26:31.566
Yeah sure, you
wanna hold it, too?

26:31.568 --> 26:32.767
What the fuck for?

26:33.268 --> 26:35.469
Look, I'm aware
that there's no

26:35.471 --> 26:38.405
official kidnapping
handbook, but if there was,

26:38.407 --> 26:40.407
I'm almost dead certain
that it would have

26:40.409 --> 26:42.375
no objection to you
moving just a little bit

26:42.377 --> 26:44.110
closer to me when
there is zero chance

26:44.112 --> 26:46.512
of me getting up out this
motherfucking chair!

26:47.280 --> 26:48.647
Go ahead,
he's not going anywhere.

26:48.881 --> 26:50.681
I tied him myself,.
He's not going anywhere.

26:52.550 --> 26:53.983
Oh, now, that's just
icing on the cake.

26:55.151 --> 26:56.284
It's scratched.

26:56.286 --> 26:57.318
What?

26:57.320 --> 26:58.552
Right there on the handle.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.353
Oh, shit, yeah I see it.

27:00.587 --> 27:02.120
God damn right you see it!

27:02.454 --> 27:03.654
You know what that is?

27:04.756 --> 27:07.891
That's one-of-a-kind,
Grade A Tahitian pearl!

27:07.893 --> 27:09.759
Fucking flawless!

27:09.761 --> 27:10.993
Do you know what a
scratch that size,

27:11.160 --> 27:12.160
that sure as shit
ain't coming out,

27:12.162 --> 27:13.761
does to its value?

27:13.763 --> 27:14.995
Yeah.

27:15.796 --> 27:17.163
It's worthless now.

27:17.165 --> 27:19.331
Okay, okay.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.066
I just made my first decision.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.500
What's that?

27:22.801 --> 27:24.134
When I get outta here,
you the first one

27:24.136 --> 27:25.535
I'm gonna shoot.

27:27.838 --> 27:29.138
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

27:29.140 --> 27:30.973
and take an educated guess.

27:31.140 --> 27:33.441
Since I've never set eyes
on any of you before,

27:33.443 --> 27:34.975
the reason why I'm
taped to this chair

27:34.977 --> 27:39.145
is not personal in
nature, which makes this

27:39.147 --> 27:41.413
unfortunate chain of events...

27:41.415 --> 27:44.215
a business transaction?

27:46.184 --> 27:48.084
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

27:48.086 --> 27:49.685
Am I gettin' warm yet?

27:51.187 --> 27:53.488
And since I'm
taped here, and not

27:53.490 --> 27:55.756
face-down in the ditch,
somebody

27:55.758 --> 27:58.091
must of offered
to bump you fellas

27:58.093 --> 28:01.194
up a couple of tax brackets
in exchange for me.

28:01.828 --> 28:03.829
And factor in y'all
weak-ass gear, my guess is

28:03.831 --> 28:05.697
this is a life-changing
sum of money.

28:05.699 --> 28:06.964
Am I right?

28:06.966 --> 28:08.899
Did I hit the nail on the head?

28:09.600 --> 28:11.434
Well, it's like 400 grand,
but it's not like

28:11.436 --> 28:12.768
we get to keep it or anything.

28:12.770 --> 28:13.869
Shut up!

28:14.503 --> 28:15.703
I'm sorry, Zach.

28:16.871 --> 28:18.104
Fuck!

28:18.305 --> 28:19.371
What?

28:19.373 --> 28:21.606
Did we not have a conversation
on the way over here?

28:21.608 --> 28:22.773
What the fuck
did we talk about?

28:22.775 --> 28:24.040
In the fucking car?

28:24.042 --> 28:25.174
What was it about?

28:25.608 --> 28:27.108
No fucking names, man!

28:27.110 --> 28:28.976
Shit man, I'm so sorry.
It's just--

28:28.978 --> 28:30.510
Oh, no, you know
what, I'm sorry,

28:30.512 --> 28:31.511
I overreacted, you're
right, you're right.

28:31.513 --> 28:32.612
You're right.

28:32.980 --> 28:34.280
What are you doing?
This is my wallet.

28:35.515 --> 28:38.183
Noah Dorfman,
316 North Flushing Avenue.

28:38.185 --> 28:39.617
Get the fuck off me!

28:41.353 --> 28:42.853
That's an old address.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.356
What you probably
are unaware of Zach,

28:46.358 --> 28:50.993
and Noah Dorfman, is I have
Demetrius Flemmings' blood

28:50.995 --> 28:53.061
coursing through my veins.

28:58.866 --> 28:59.932
Oh.

29:00.366 --> 29:01.866
By the pathetic
look on y'all faces,

29:01.868 --> 29:03.934
suffice it to say you've
never heard of him.

29:05.036 --> 29:06.202
Google him!

29:11.974 --> 29:13.140
Here, I found something.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.042
A lawyer for Demetrius
Flemmings, head of the

29:16.044 --> 29:17.843
black crime syndicate,
filed a motion

29:17.845 --> 29:19.845
Wednesday formally
asking the judge

29:19.847 --> 29:22.314
to dismiss all charges
against his client.

29:22.316 --> 29:25.016
Flemmings is currently
under felony indictment

29:25.018 --> 29:28.219
for drug trafficking,
conspiracy, money laundering

29:28.221 --> 29:30.588
and the disappearance
of two federal agents.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.222
It goes on.

29:33.325 --> 29:34.724
Me and this kidnapping master

29:34.726 --> 29:36.659
share a very special bond,

29:36.661 --> 29:38.560
me being
his favorite nephew and all.

29:38.562 --> 29:41.062
And factor in,
you miserable fucks

29:41.064 --> 29:43.831
snatched me off the
motherfucking toilet.

29:44.732 --> 29:46.232
Which in my books is
as sacred a ground

29:46.234 --> 29:49.067
as Saint Mary's
fucking Cathedral.

29:50.102 --> 29:51.402
Yeah.

29:52.337 --> 29:54.971
That means y'all are
pretty much fucking dead!

29:55.872 --> 29:57.072
You're dead!

29:58.007 --> 29:59.407
Eddie just fucked us!

30:00.576 --> 30:01.875
Will you calm down?

30:01.877 --> 30:03.009
Okay, you're gonna
break something.

30:03.243 --> 30:04.476
Remember, everybody
promised that

30:05.044 --> 30:06.110
we're gonna leave everything
exactly as they found it.

30:11.781 --> 30:14.582
Did you not just hear,
less than ten seconds ago,

30:14.584 --> 30:16.617
who the fuck we have tied
up in that fucking room?

30:16.619 --> 30:17.918
Yes, I fucking heard!

30:17.920 --> 30:19.219
Shut up!

30:19.221 --> 30:20.853
We are so fucking
royally fucked!

30:20.855 --> 30:22.788
What are you
doing, are you okay?

30:22.790 --> 30:23.789
What is that?

30:23.791 --> 30:25.190
It's fine, okay?

30:25.192 --> 30:26.457
It's my anxiety
medication, I'm fine.

30:26.459 --> 30:27.991
Oh, great, he's high.

30:29.126 --> 30:30.759
I say we just let Marques go.

30:33.928 --> 30:36.129
Okay, all right, that
sounds like an idea.

30:36.697 --> 30:38.130
And then what?

30:38.132 --> 30:39.464
What do we do then?

30:39.466 --> 30:40.431
Eddie blames us
for his dead niece,

30:40.632 --> 30:41.865
we end up in the
back of a trunk.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.799
We go to the police, we
ask for protective custody!

30:43.801 --> 30:45.066
No, no, no, no!

30:45.068 --> 30:46.267
We did the kidnapping!

30:47.035 --> 30:48.869
Yeah, I know, I could
see how that could

30:48.871 --> 30:50.136
potentially work against us.
Okay.

30:51.138 --> 30:52.304
--Fuck!

30:52.306 --> 30:53.838
Is that Eddie?
-Hello.

30:54.806 --> 30:56.206
Yes, hi, this is him.

30:56.607 --> 30:58.608
Um. Yeah, can you hold please?

30:58.610 --> 30:59.709
It's not.

30:59.711 --> 31:00.810
It's not.

31:03.246 --> 31:06.248
Warren, Warren can you
have a word with him?

31:06.250 --> 31:08.049
Okay, no one can
know we are here.

31:08.051 --> 31:09.850
I could lose my agent's
license over this!

31:11.319 --> 31:13.787
Look, Zach's a little
stressed out right now.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.823
Dude, we have a Crip or
a Blood, or Snoop Dogg's cousin

31:16.825 --> 31:19.525
tied up in there. We're all
a little stressed right now!

31:19.826 --> 31:22.194
Listen to me,
he's not sure but,

31:23.062 --> 31:24.495
Zach thinks that
his fiancé's been

31:24.497 --> 31:25.863
seeing somebody else.

31:26.664 --> 31:27.997
What?

31:28.231 --> 31:29.731
You know how she was
a registered nurse?

31:29.733 --> 31:30.898
Yeah.

31:31.232 --> 31:32.398
Yeah, well, she's
been coming home late,

31:32.665 --> 31:33.865
and you know, which
shouldn't set off

31:34.433 --> 31:36.967
any alarm bells in itself
but, he finds this little

31:36.969 --> 31:38.868
match book from a hotel.

31:39.502 --> 31:40.702
Shit.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.303
So then he hires this
private investigator

31:42.305 --> 31:43.737
to see if it's true.

31:43.739 --> 31:44.971
Really?

31:45.172 --> 31:46.138
Yeah, so there's a
lot going on right now.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.672
Wow.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.441
I feel terrible
for him that's...

31:50.443 --> 31:51.542
Yeah, I know.

31:52.176 --> 31:53.543
You think I'll be
invited to the wedding?

31:55.112 --> 31:56.679
Mm. No.

31:57.747 --> 31:58.880
Okay.

31:59.314 --> 32:03.984
I think I want to move
this right here, yeah.

32:08.289 --> 32:12.658
Well, if I was you, my son,
I would take this one

32:12.660 --> 32:13.859
and move it right here.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.761
Because see, you
don't want these mens

32:16.763 --> 32:18.329
to get over on your side.

32:18.331 --> 32:20.531
You have to protect your
queen and your king,

32:20.533 --> 32:22.833
so if I was you I would
have done that one,

32:22.835 --> 32:24.201
that way you can save them.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.002
Hey, Bobby.
Go on over with Leon.

32:26.703 --> 32:28.436
For you, boss.
Says it's important.

32:34.476 --> 32:36.176
Okay, what is it now?

32:40.547 --> 32:41.847
Are you kidding me?

32:43.282 --> 32:44.882
When, who?

32:46.351 --> 32:47.851
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hold him down.

32:49.019 --> 32:50.152
I'll take care of it.

32:50.154 --> 32:51.186
Appreciate your call.

32:51.188 --> 32:52.620
Later.

33:16.642 --> 33:17.875
Spread the word.

33:18.309 --> 33:21.811
Two million dollars cash
to whoever finds my nephew.

33:27.383 --> 33:28.950
I'm starved.

33:30.585 --> 33:32.319
Do y'all got any
food in this place?

33:32.887 --> 33:34.621
I'm sorry, fridge is empty.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.555
Nobody lived here for ages.

33:37.256 --> 33:39.257
-I could eat something.
-Yeah, me too.

33:39.691 --> 33:41.558
Well, we're shit out of luck,
'cause there's no food.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.892
So let's just stop
talking about food.

33:43.260 --> 33:44.526
Come on, we're
gonna be here for

33:44.528 --> 33:45.960
God knows how long, and nobody

33:46.194 --> 33:48.728
took the fucking initiative
to pack some sandwiches?

33:49.596 --> 33:51.563
I could go out and
pick something up.

33:51.565 --> 33:54.265
You know it's just, there's
not a whole lot around here.

33:54.267 --> 33:56.333
Well, we passed
that ice cream place
on the way here.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.467
Oh, yeah.

33:57.734 --> 33:58.800
Okay, yeah, yeah,
that's something.

33:59.034 --> 34:00.334
We're not going
out for ice cream.

34:00.336 --> 34:01.401
I could pick it up.

34:01.403 --> 34:02.902
I said no, no ice cream!

34:02.904 --> 34:04.603
We're not fucking going
out for ice cream!

34:04.605 --> 34:06.037
Zach, what's the
worst that could happen?

34:06.039 --> 34:07.405
You just got through
saying you were hungry.

34:07.407 --> 34:08.505
We're all hungry.

34:10.275 --> 34:12.175
All right.
Fuck it.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.743
Sure, you're right.
Get me mint chip.

34:14.944 --> 34:16.110
Yes.

34:16.112 --> 34:17.578
Sea salt caramel, cone.

34:18.279 --> 34:20.045
A pistachio cup.

34:20.047 --> 34:21.080
Marques?

34:21.081 --> 34:22.347
Um, vanilla bean.

34:22.349 --> 34:24.681
-Great, all right.
-Don't be long!

34:25.516 --> 34:27.083
Ah shit, guys, I need money,

34:27.085 --> 34:28.618
I don't have any cash anymore.

34:28.620 --> 34:29.719
I don't got shit.

34:29.721 --> 34:31.053
I only got three bucks, man.

34:31.054 --> 34:32.621
I'm light too,
don't look at me.

34:38.726 --> 34:39.827
No.

34:43.797 --> 34:44.931
There we go.

34:45.933 --> 34:47.366
Triple scoops for everyone.

34:47.368 --> 34:48.467
Nice!

34:48.935 --> 34:50.101
Thank you.

34:51.735 --> 34:54.670
Now that is wrong on
so many fucking levels.

35:01.145 --> 35:02.377
It's him!

35:09.551 --> 35:10.584
Eddie.

35:10.586 --> 35:11.751
Put him on speaker.

35:11.753 --> 35:13.152
<i> How 'bout you, Zach?</i>

35:13.154 --> 35:14.786
<i>- You screwed us!
-  How's that?</i>

35:14.788 --> 35:16.954
-Black crime syndicate?
-You knew who this guy was!

35:16.956 --> 35:19.122
You got him then, that's good!

35:19.124 --> 35:20.823
For your niece maybe,
not so much for us!

35:20.825 --> 35:22.291
Ah, come on now,
you know, Marques

35:22.293 --> 35:24.393
has had a rough day,
he's been kidnapped.

35:24.894 --> 35:27.328
You know, it's part of the
territory, occupational hazard.

35:27.762 --> 35:28.995
Occupational hazard?

35:28.997 --> 35:30.129
Eddie, I hit this
man in the head

35:30.131 --> 35:31.630
with a fucking toilet lid!

35:31.964 --> 35:33.164
<i> Putting a bullet in the
 back of my fucking head</i>

35:33.565 --> 35:35.132
<i> is gonna be the first
 thing on his list.</i>

35:35.134 --> 35:35.966
<i> You know what, Eddie,
 maybe we'll untie him</i>

35:35.968 --> 35:37.467
<i> and let him go.</i>

35:37.469 --> 35:38.901
Or better yet, why don't
we just let him know

35:39.235 --> 35:41.269
and his fucking uncle,
fucking who put us up to this!

35:41.271 --> 35:42.503
Oh, really?

35:42.937 --> 35:43.937
Now you listen to me, you
little motherfuckers.

35:43.939 --> 35:45.138
I'll cut your fucking heads off

35:45.439 --> 35:47.706
and stuff them down your
fucking necks, okay?

35:48.140 --> 35:50.007
Until my niece gets
back, you're gonna do

35:50.009 --> 35:51.842
exactly what I want you to do.

35:52.009 --> 35:53.476
You don't want to
see my response

35:53.478 --> 35:55.311
if something happens
to her, buddy!

35:55.313 --> 35:56.679
You don't wanna see it.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.147
All right, Eddie listen,
just relax, okay?

35:59.149 --> 36:00.648
--Eddie, Eddie?

36:10.691 --> 36:11.991
Let's do it.

36:38.684 --> 36:39.750
Hey.

36:40.351 --> 36:41.451
Hey.

36:41.685 --> 36:43.085
Wow, look at all that.

36:46.989 --> 36:48.222
You Julian?

36:49.224 --> 36:50.457
Now, come on.

36:50.459 --> 36:51.791
I was told that that's the name

36:51.793 --> 36:53.058
of an athletic-looking brother

36:53.060 --> 36:54.726
wearing a bright red tracksuit.

36:54.728 --> 36:55.893
Hangs out in front
of the building

36:55.895 --> 36:57.094
with this address.

36:58.062 --> 36:59.395
Unless my information's off by

36:59.629 --> 37:02.230
a country fucking mile,
that makes you Julian.

37:02.698 --> 37:03.831
Okay, so I'm Julian.

37:03.833 --> 37:05.132
Good.

37:05.134 --> 37:06.500
'Cause you looked at me
like I asked you

37:06.502 --> 37:08.068
to recite the
Gettysburg Address.

37:08.536 --> 37:10.136
You got me cracking, now what?

37:10.637 --> 37:12.037
Cut to the chase, I like that.

37:12.538 --> 37:13.804
We're looking for Tyrone.

37:14.005 --> 37:15.105
Who?

37:15.339 --> 37:17.306
Who?
Again with the perplexing look.

37:18.041 --> 37:19.274
Tyrone.

37:19.642 --> 37:21.209
And before you tell me
where I can find him,

37:21.211 --> 37:23.811
I want you to know I
see that semi-automatic

37:23.813 --> 37:25.612
you're eyeballing on
the table over there.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.047
Little Mike, would
you agree that Julian

37:29.049 --> 37:30.214
reaching for that
pistol would ignite

37:30.216 --> 37:32.583
an already flammable situation?

37:32.585 --> 37:33.951
Most definitely.

37:34.185 --> 37:35.752
So from where
I'm standing, I see

37:35.754 --> 37:37.386
that you have two options.

37:37.388 --> 37:40.889
One, you can make a
play for that gun,

37:40.891 --> 37:43.057
in which I blow your
fucking brains out.

37:43.391 --> 37:46.726
Or two, simply tell me
where I can find Tyrone.

37:47.227 --> 37:50.128
Me and my little buddy here
will be ancient history.

37:54.432 --> 37:55.732
What do you say?

37:55.734 --> 37:56.999
Door number one or
door number two?

38:02.238 --> 38:03.737
Hmm, door number three.

38:06.006 --> 38:07.806
Holy crap, that's impressive.

38:08.073 --> 38:09.406
Look at him go.

38:09.408 --> 38:11.107
Yeah, probably
lettered in track.

38:13.076 --> 38:14.142
Hey, kid.

38:16.612 --> 38:18.279
Do you know where
we can find Tyrone?

38:18.281 --> 38:19.613
And if you give me
that same fucking look

38:19.615 --> 38:21.514
Julian gave me,
I'm gonna shoot ya.

38:25.418 --> 38:26.684
How old are you?

38:26.686 --> 38:27.818
15.

38:28.219 --> 38:29.552
15.

38:29.554 --> 38:30.653
What's your name?

38:30.854 --> 38:32.020
William.

38:32.022 --> 38:33.454
-William what?
-Harrison.

38:33.855 --> 38:35.455
Okay, William Harrison,
this is one of those

38:35.457 --> 38:37.290
rare moments in life,

38:37.292 --> 38:39.158
that you're gonna get
a second chance.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.695
You're gonna get up,
walk out that door,

38:44.063 --> 38:45.630
check yourself back
into school,

38:46.198 --> 38:48.232
<i>study, read Catcher in the Rye,</i>

38:48.234 --> 38:51.768
graduate, you get a shot
at not ending up back here.

38:51.770 --> 38:53.269
Word gets back to me
that you

38:53.271 --> 38:55.204
so much as fucking
skipped woodshop,

38:56.573 --> 38:58.140
I'll be paying you
a house visit.

38:58.741 --> 38:59.807
We clear?

39:00.241 --> 39:02.842
Pick up your shirt,
get the fuck outta here.

39:03.910 --> 39:05.043
Go!

39:27.163 --> 39:28.563
Summer time's here, babe!

39:28.964 --> 39:30.164
Jesus, Noah.

39:30.732 --> 39:32.165
How long's it take you to
pick up fucking ice cream?

39:32.167 --> 39:34.367
Hey, I didn't see you
volunteer to go, Warren.

39:34.901 --> 39:37.002
All right,
who had the pistachio?

39:37.004 --> 39:38.737
-That was me.
-All right.

39:38.739 --> 39:40.004
What the hell?
It's melted already.

39:40.006 --> 39:41.105
I know.

39:41.107 --> 39:42.439
Salted caramel.

39:42.441 --> 39:43.506
That's mine.

39:44.107 --> 39:45.240
I wanted a cone.

39:45.474 --> 39:47.541
Jeez, umm, my bad.
Sorry.

39:47.909 --> 39:49.075
Um...

39:50.077 --> 39:51.210
This is for you.

39:52.478 --> 39:55.213
And, Mr. Marques.

39:58.283 --> 39:59.716
Oh, shit.

39:59.983 --> 40:03.085
Umm, we're gonna have to
untie his hands or something.

40:03.087 --> 40:04.486
Out of the question.

40:04.488 --> 40:06.087
Well, how's he gonna eat?

40:13.828 --> 40:15.228
I'm sorry about this.

40:15.829 --> 40:19.263
What, kidnapping me
or the spoon-feed part?

40:19.265 --> 40:20.831
All of it.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.366
Hey, nice tattoo.

40:23.533 --> 40:24.766
Oh, that?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.001
Yeah, all the guys
in my squad got one.

40:27.003 --> 40:28.435
It was kinda
a solidarity thing.

40:29.003 --> 40:30.837
Hmm, didn't peg
you as ex-military.

40:30.839 --> 40:32.772
Me, yeah, signed
up after graduation.

40:32.774 --> 40:34.974
I bought into the
whole girls and guys

40:34.976 --> 40:36.141
in uniform thing.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.509
Oh.

40:37.676 --> 40:40.878
And the... pussy just
fall into your lap?

40:41.546 --> 40:43.380
No, I never actually
saw any action in the Army

40:43.382 --> 40:45.315
they found out
I had a lazy eye.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.516
Signed me up to SPO.

40:46.518 --> 40:48.484
Strategic planning
and operations?

40:48.486 --> 40:51.820
Yeah, didn't get me
laid, but I learned a lot.

40:51.822 --> 40:54.022
Glad to know our tax
dollars didn't go to waste.

41:01.863 --> 41:03.363
You know what?

41:03.365 --> 41:06.865
Sometimes what looks
like a dead fucking end

41:07.466 --> 41:12.202
to a dire situation,
can be an opportunity.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.372
I don't follow.

41:17.307 --> 41:19.408
Have you ever
ended up at the end

41:19.410 --> 41:21.209
of an unexpected windfall?

41:21.810 --> 41:22.876
Me, no.

41:23.177 --> 41:25.011
I don't catch breaks.

41:25.013 --> 41:26.912
I'm like the unluckiest
guy you'll ever meet.

41:27.213 --> 41:29.546
Well, maybe, maybe not.

41:30.681 --> 41:32.515
Well, okay.

41:32.517 --> 41:33.582
Take this for example.

41:33.584 --> 41:36.984
My father, he died this year.

41:38.219 --> 41:39.586
I'm sorry to hear that.

41:39.853 --> 41:41.520
He was kind of a big
shot on Wall Street, okay?

41:41.522 --> 41:43.655
He made a, made a ton of money.

41:43.657 --> 41:45.223
The lawyer calls me,
he tells me

41:45.225 --> 41:47.325
after the sale of three
homes, which is worth

41:47.327 --> 41:49.827
less than what is owed
to my father's creditors,

41:49.829 --> 41:51.995
his ex-wives, taxes,
all that shit,

41:52.663 --> 41:55.264
there's pretty
much nothing left.

41:55.266 --> 41:56.732
You know, I walk
away with a check

41:56.734 --> 41:58.600
for 3,000 dollars
and this fucking watch.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.234
Whoa! Gah!

42:00.935 --> 42:02.468
You know what, Noah?

42:03.069 --> 42:05.170
Sometimes you gotta make
your own luck in life.

42:06.372 --> 42:08.072
I have a proposition for you.

42:10.508 --> 42:12.408
A way for you to
walk away from this,

42:12.410 --> 42:15.210
and in the process,
take with you

42:15.212 --> 42:16.978
some very heavy paper.

42:18.380 --> 42:19.613
Un-cuff me.

42:20.081 --> 42:22.048
I'll pick a moment where
I'll make it look like

42:22.050 --> 42:25.918
I untied the ropes myself,
I disappear from here.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.152
And you wake up
tomorrow morning

42:28.953 --> 42:34.424
with a bag full of
cash under your pillow.

42:36.894 --> 42:40.596
Yeah, I can't do that.

42:41.898 --> 42:43.265
You don't think there's
a search party out there

42:43.267 --> 42:45.300
right now looking for me?

42:45.968 --> 42:48.803
I bet you dimes to
dollars, somebody

42:48.805 --> 42:51.171
caught a few digits on that
license plate of yours.

42:53.073 --> 42:55.473
It's only a matter of time
before that doorbell ring.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.476
I ain't gonna lie to ya, Noah.

43:00.444 --> 43:02.945
Somebody's getting
invoiced for this shit.

43:05.148 --> 43:06.882
It just doesn't have to be you.

43:32.941 --> 43:34.074
Hi.

43:34.842 --> 43:36.209
Where's Marques Flemmings?

43:36.743 --> 43:38.710
<i>I didn't even know that
 puto was missing, huh?</i>

43:39.111 --> 43:40.778
We know all you
pimps and drug dealers,

43:40.780 --> 43:42.613
you have your noses in
up each others' business.

43:42.615 --> 43:43.747
You know somethin'.

43:44.148 --> 43:46.015
Yeah, I know
somethin' all right.

43:46.649 --> 43:48.349
My motherfuckin' rights?

43:48.351 --> 43:49.483
This shit illegal!

43:49.851 --> 43:51.251
<i>Fuck off me, puto!</i>

43:52.419 --> 43:54.253
Let's see if this
refreshes your memory, huh?

43:54.854 --> 43:55.920
What the fuck!

43:56.187 --> 43:57.253
No!

43:57.255 --> 43:58.520
Your memory comin' back now?

43:58.522 --> 44:00.088
Marques Flemmings.

44:00.090 --> 44:01.556
Shit! I told you I don't know!

44:07.195 --> 44:08.595
What the fuck you do?

44:09.663 --> 44:11.530
Oh, man, I'm sorry, my bad.

44:18.370 --> 44:19.669
When he gets into the office,

44:19.671 --> 44:21.370
can you have him
call me, please?

44:21.372 --> 44:22.504
Thank you.

44:23.138 --> 44:24.271
Fucking moron.

44:25.506 --> 44:27.106
Thought you were done
with that shit, man.

44:29.776 --> 44:31.109
I'm trying to stay awake.

44:31.343 --> 44:33.110
-All right.
-Don't judge me.

44:33.112 --> 44:34.978
I am not fucking judging you.

44:34.980 --> 44:36.946
Don't-- Get off your high
horse, you've been...

44:36.948 --> 44:38.681
you've been sober 15 days.

44:38.683 --> 44:40.516
I am not judging you,
Zach, take it easy.

44:44.619 --> 44:45.752
Everything okay?

44:46.687 --> 44:47.853
Peachy.

44:47.855 --> 44:49.287
Anything I can do to help?

44:49.488 --> 44:50.955
This girl's taking a
wrecking ball to my life,

44:50.957 --> 44:52.356
you could help with that.

44:52.358 --> 44:53.857
Well, maybe there's
nothing there.

44:53.859 --> 44:55.692
That was the
private investigator.

44:55.694 --> 44:57.727
She left the house an
hour and a half ago.

44:57.729 --> 44:59.028
She still hasn't come back yet,

44:59.030 --> 45:00.496
she said she was staying in.

45:00.498 --> 45:01.530
Okay, where did
you tell her that

45:01.532 --> 45:02.731
you were going tonight?

45:03.232 --> 45:05.299
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

45:05.301 --> 45:06.867
Well, isn't it
obvious that you didn't

45:06.869 --> 45:08.134
tell her the truth either?

45:08.368 --> 45:09.234
And it's not like you're
out fucking around,

45:09.236 --> 45:10.702
that's what I'm saying.

45:10.903 --> 45:12.503
I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about her.

45:12.505 --> 45:13.871
Are you trying to make
me feel worse here?

45:13.873 --> 45:15.806
-I don't know!
-Whose side are you on?

45:15.808 --> 45:17.541
No, I'm just saying,
maybe look,

45:17.543 --> 45:19.142
maybe this is
naive of me to say,

45:19.144 --> 45:20.376
but isn't it
possible that there's

45:20.378 --> 45:21.710
nothing going on?

45:21.911 --> 45:24.479
Oh, no, not possible.

45:24.481 --> 45:25.813
-Okay.
-Too many holes.

45:25.815 --> 45:26.947
All right.

45:27.348 --> 45:28.581
Too many gaps.

45:30.250 --> 45:31.583
God dammit.

45:32.318 --> 45:34.185
Look, Zach.

45:34.187 --> 45:38.321
I'm not trying to be
your couples' therapist.

45:38.855 --> 45:41.523
All I'm doing is talking to
you as a friend right now.

45:41.525 --> 45:42.891
Okay, well then, talk to me.

45:42.893 --> 45:44.592
I'm telling you
that if you keep going

45:44.594 --> 45:46.293
down this path,
you're always gonna be

45:46.494 --> 45:49.395
questioning and doubting every
little thing that she does.

45:49.397 --> 45:51.263
Until it's gonna get
so bad, she can't

45:51.265 --> 45:52.731
go to the dry cleaners
without you

45:52.733 --> 45:54.733
making a list
in your head

45:54.735 --> 45:56.067
about who she's gonna fuck.

45:56.069 --> 45:56.634
You understand?

46:00.338 --> 46:02.305
If only that
stock went through.

46:03.707 --> 46:05.641
I mean Janie, she's...

46:06.609 --> 46:07.809
she's beautiful.

46:08.410 --> 46:11.078
I mean, I really love her,
we really have a connection.

46:11.279 --> 46:15.281
The only way to manage a
woman like that's happiness,

46:16.716 --> 46:18.349
is with "fuck you" money.

46:22.920 --> 46:26.588
I put every single one of
my clients into that stock.

46:28.891 --> 46:29.957
What?

46:30.591 --> 46:32.592
All of them.
I mean, how many times

46:32.594 --> 46:33.926
do you get to play
the slots knowing

46:34.260 --> 46:36.094
the next pull, three
cherries are gonna come up?

46:36.462 --> 46:39.997
I mean that's a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

46:40.732 --> 46:43.867
Well, listen, man,
you know, sometimes

46:43.869 --> 46:46.069
these things just
work themselves out.

46:46.071 --> 46:49.372
In my line of work, when
you fuck up like that,

46:49.374 --> 46:52.441
it doesn't really
promote career longevity!

46:52.443 --> 46:53.542
Okay.

46:53.876 --> 46:55.109
She's gonna leave me.

46:55.910 --> 46:57.277
Oh, man.

46:57.279 --> 46:58.478
For sure.

47:07.752 --> 47:09.219
Hey.

47:09.221 --> 47:10.286
Jerry.

47:10.620 --> 47:12.020
Go over to Diamond's.

47:12.221 --> 47:13.287
What for?

47:15.623 --> 47:17.757
Okey-doke, we're on our way.

47:17.759 --> 47:18.824
Okay.

47:26.964 --> 47:28.397
Okay, let's do this.

47:28.765 --> 47:29.831
Come on.

47:35.236 --> 47:36.402
Sir.

47:36.404 --> 47:37.669
How can I help you?

47:37.671 --> 47:38.903
Tommy, is he here?

47:38.905 --> 47:40.070
He's under that taxi.

47:44.275 --> 47:45.608
Tommy!

47:45.610 --> 47:46.909
Yeah.

47:48.077 --> 47:49.143
Yeah.

47:49.145 --> 47:50.511
I'm a friend of Paula's.

47:50.513 --> 47:51.612
Okay, she's got
a lot of friends.

47:51.614 --> 47:52.746
Who the fuck are you?

47:52.748 --> 47:53.980
I'm her cousin Eddie.

47:55.816 --> 47:57.982
Oh, fuck. Oh, God, God!

48:01.585 --> 48:03.052
Fuck!

48:04.320 --> 48:07.088
Tell her you're sorry,
you buy her some flowers,

48:07.090 --> 48:08.522
and don't make me come back!

48:39.785 --> 48:40.885
Hank.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.452
I've been expecting you.

48:44.021 --> 48:45.388
What's going on here?

48:45.789 --> 48:47.256
Oh, him, you haven't heard?

48:48.024 --> 48:49.557
Flemmings' nephew got snatched.

48:49.791 --> 48:51.691
He put up a big bank roll
for whoever can find him.

48:51.693 --> 48:53.325
Negro over here
knows where he's at,

48:53.327 --> 48:55.026
but as you can see,
we're having a little bit

48:55.028 --> 48:56.694
of a communication problem.

48:57.062 --> 48:59.029
We're taking a little
break right now.

48:59.031 --> 49:00.230
Yeah, evidently.

49:00.664 --> 49:02.498
Well, we're looking for
his other nephew, Tyrone.

49:02.500 --> 49:04.066
Eddie says you got
an address for us.

49:04.068 --> 49:05.667
Just waitin' for the call.

49:05.669 --> 49:07.535
Friend of mine hangs out
with Tyrone all the time

49:07.537 --> 49:09.370
down at Sullivan's.

49:10.205 --> 49:11.905
Eddie tell you we
agreed to five grand?

49:12.506 --> 49:13.973
You get this when
I get the address.

49:14.541 --> 49:15.807
Sure.

49:15.809 --> 49:17.141
No problem.

49:17.143 --> 49:19.243
Have a drink,
shouldn't be long.

49:19.811 --> 49:20.877
All right.

49:25.649 --> 49:26.782
Guys!

49:27.583 --> 49:29.216
Come here.

49:29.218 --> 49:30.383
Come here.

49:35.922 --> 49:37.389
So that was Eddie.

49:38.023 --> 49:40.724
He said everything on
his end is going forward.

49:42.059 --> 49:43.092
And?

49:43.094 --> 49:44.226
And that's it.

49:44.228 --> 49:45.894
Now we just sit, and we wait.

49:45.896 --> 49:47.562
Sit and wait, wonderful.

49:47.564 --> 49:49.163
Well, did he give you
any idea how much

49:49.165 --> 49:50.531
longer it'd be?

49:50.533 --> 49:51.965
Shut up, Noah!

49:52.199 --> 49:53.933
Look, let's just take shifts
watching him, all right?

49:53.935 --> 49:55.401
We'll switch out
every two hours.

49:55.403 --> 49:57.236
This way
we can get some sleep.

49:57.238 --> 49:58.537
-Yeah, all right.
-Okay, all right.

49:58.539 --> 49:59.671
I'll go first.

49:59.673 --> 50:00.872
You sure?

50:00.874 --> 50:01.939
Yeah.

50:08.612 --> 50:09.945
Did I ever tell
you guys how I got

50:09.947 --> 50:11.613
this scar on my ear?

50:11.615 --> 50:13.247
-Uh-uh.
-You haven't heard that?

50:13.249 --> 50:14.281
Nope.

50:14.283 --> 50:15.782
I thought I told that to ya.

50:15.949 --> 50:17.249
Crazy story.

50:17.850 --> 50:20.284
My older brother, who
was pursuing a career

50:20.286 --> 50:21.718
in law enforcement,
decided to go

50:21.720 --> 50:23.252
in a different direction,
and was dealing

50:23.254 --> 50:25.420
eight balls that were
one-third product,

50:25.422 --> 50:26.954
two-thirds baking soda.

50:27.588 --> 50:29.388
<i> I'm home with chicken pox,
 when, you know,</i>

50:29.390 --> 50:30.756
<i> one of his disgruntled
 clients decided</i>

50:30.758 --> 50:32.190
<i> to pay a house visit.</i>

50:33.859 --> 50:35.693
<i> So, he wanted to know
 where my brother was,</i>

50:35.695 --> 50:37.594
<i> and how a household
 baking ingredient</i>

50:37.596 --> 50:39.262
<i> ended up inside the bag.</i>

50:40.464 --> 50:41.931
<i> I told him I don't know,
 and that</i>

50:41.933 --> 50:43.632
<i> my chicken pox was contagious.</i>

50:44.433 --> 50:46.267
<i> He apparently wasn't
 pleased with that answer.</i>

50:47.068 --> 50:49.102
<i> Meanwhile, this kid
 Isaac was living</i>

50:49.104 --> 50:50.770
<i> in the apartment downstairs.</i>

50:52.873 --> 50:54.406
<i> On this day,
 he decides to come home</i>

50:54.408 --> 50:56.340
<i> a little earlier than
 his mother expected.</i>

50:59.143 --> 51:02.444
<i>Finds her home a little earlier
 than he expected as well.</i>

51:05.314 --> 51:06.681
<i> So he goes into the
 kitchen, and instead of</i>

51:06.948 --> 51:08.581
<i> looking in the
 refrigerator for his usual,</i>

51:08.583 --> 51:10.816
<i> you know, after-school treat,
 he helps himself</i>

51:10.818 --> 51:13.351
<i> to his father's
 sawed-off shotgun.</i>

51:14.920 --> 51:17.954
<i> Meanwhile, my situation
 upstairs was deteriorating.</i>

51:19.423 --> 51:21.689
<i> This asshole was
 gonna cut my ear off.</i>

51:33.600 --> 51:35.534
<i> It was nothing short
 of divine intervention.</i>

51:37.136 --> 51:38.936
<i> I'm telling you, man, if it
 wasn't for this kid Isaac,</i>

51:38.938 --> 51:40.870
<i> the guy would've taken
 my ear clean off.</i>

51:43.607 --> 51:44.873
It was a fucking miracle.

51:45.975 --> 51:47.342
--What the fuck?

51:49.245 --> 51:50.744
You've got a gun, get me.

52:05.590 --> 52:06.690
Fuck.

52:07.091 --> 52:08.658
What the fuck'd you
do that for, Jerry?

52:09.626 --> 52:10.926
Say hi to Isaac.

52:12.628 --> 52:13.761
Hi, Isaac.

52:14.162 --> 52:15.462
What are the odds of that?

52:15.464 --> 52:16.563
I don't know.

52:30.477 --> 52:31.577
Hey, buddy.

52:32.946 --> 52:34.179
You look like shit.

52:40.150 --> 52:41.283
Hello?

52:41.285 --> 52:44.152
<i> Yo, Tyrone
 is hangin' with his ho at
 Second Side Apartments.</i>

52:44.154 --> 52:45.153
<i> Second floor on the left.</i>

52:45.155 --> 52:46.087
Thanks.

52:48.390 --> 52:49.556
We're good.

52:49.558 --> 52:50.723
We're good!

52:50.725 --> 52:51.857
You good?

52:52.391 --> 52:53.958
Let's get the fuck outta here.

53:10.708 --> 53:12.308
You ever fire one of those?

53:14.744 --> 53:16.010
What?

53:16.012 --> 53:17.311
Gun.

53:18.513 --> 53:19.713
Call me crazy.

53:20.414 --> 53:22.214
You don't seem like the type.

53:23.015 --> 53:24.982
Not that you couldn't
if you had to.

53:24.984 --> 53:26.783
Well, let's not give
me a reason to have to.

53:27.417 --> 53:30.452
Hey, I'm on board with that.

53:32.822 --> 53:35.890
You know where I come
from, if somebody

53:35.892 --> 53:37.892
asks you to put some
iron in the back

53:37.894 --> 53:40.294
of somebody's head
that you never met,

53:41.262 --> 53:42.428
you just do it.

53:43.496 --> 53:45.162
No questions asked.

53:47.899 --> 53:50.700
When you was growin' up,
did your pops

53:50.702 --> 53:54.503
ever tell you to do
uncomfortable shit

53:54.505 --> 53:56.338
because it made you
build character?

53:56.340 --> 53:57.405
All the time.

53:57.407 --> 53:59.073
My pops, too.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.841
You know,

54:01.108 --> 54:03.008
he was a big proponent
of character building.

54:04.610 --> 54:06.377
And me, you know, I
was like the oldest,

54:06.379 --> 54:09.646
so he decided he wanted
to get me started early.

54:10.381 --> 54:12.448
Check it out, he sent
me over to this house.

54:12.782 --> 54:16.484
With nothing but a
flare and some matches.

54:17.018 --> 54:19.386
By the time the
fire truck showed up,

54:19.388 --> 54:21.221
there wasn't nothing
left but ashes.

54:21.223 --> 54:22.488
Now I didn't find out
'til I saw

54:22.755 --> 54:25.223
in the paper the next
morning, that there was

54:25.225 --> 54:26.924
a family of four inside.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.327
None of which made it out.

54:32.063 --> 54:33.663
Nigga, I was 13.

54:37.100 --> 54:41.435
As you can imagine,
sucked all the fun

54:41.437 --> 54:43.336
right out of my childhood.

54:50.810 --> 54:52.210
You ever wonder what
your life would be like

54:52.212 --> 54:53.878
if you chose a different path?

54:54.546 --> 54:55.913
You mean doing
something other than

54:55.915 --> 54:57.848
going into the family business?

55:02.452 --> 55:04.553
Only every day.

55:27.173 --> 55:28.472
Hey, Noah, are you awake?

55:31.342 --> 55:32.575
Yeah.

55:33.410 --> 55:36.578
That cow on the window is
really freaking me out.

55:38.782 --> 55:40.414
Oh, shit, yeah.

55:40.948 --> 55:43.215
-That's some freaky shit, man.
-Christ Almighty.

55:47.653 --> 55:50.488
Hey, Noah, um,
there's something

55:50.490 --> 55:52.322
I kinda want to
talk to you about.

55:54.658 --> 55:56.025
Yeah, what is it?

55:57.327 --> 55:58.960
Well, you know how
in AA there's that

55:58.962 --> 56:03.330
whole thing about, you know,
making amends, whatever,

56:03.332 --> 56:05.265
with people that you've
hurt in the past?

56:06.166 --> 56:07.266
Mm-hm.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.934
You know Zach
and Matthew and I,

56:10.335 --> 56:12.936
you know back in
the day we, we were

56:12.938 --> 56:15.738
pretty relentless
about torturing you.

56:17.173 --> 56:18.706
Warren, I was the
only kid in school

56:18.708 --> 56:20.841
who knew how to
use the word binary

56:20.843 --> 56:22.642
in a sentence, that pretty much

56:22.644 --> 56:25.011
warranted open season on me.

56:25.979 --> 56:28.380
I mean, Noah, we really
pulled some shit on you.

56:30.316 --> 56:31.582
Yeah, well.

56:33.151 --> 56:36.553
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

56:37.021 --> 56:38.121
Right?

56:38.123 --> 56:39.288
Yeah.

56:39.290 --> 56:40.389
Well.

56:41.124 --> 56:42.891
I just wanted you to
know that, you know,

56:42.893 --> 56:47.629
I feel bad about it and,
uh, and I'm sorry.

56:50.532 --> 56:51.765
All right.

57:01.641 --> 57:05.777
Half, a million, dollars.

57:11.316 --> 57:12.582
That's my offer.

57:14.851 --> 57:18.119
All you got to do is un-cuff me,

57:18.587 --> 57:20.887
and let me walk out
that door unchecked.

57:22.723 --> 57:23.923
I can't do that.

57:25.225 --> 57:29.795
500K that you get to keep.

57:30.663 --> 57:31.796
For yourself.

57:33.899 --> 57:35.966
My brother, you
better think hard.

57:36.600 --> 57:39.468
My offer ain't just gonna
hang out there in the ether.

57:39.769 --> 57:41.269
Before sunup one of
you's gonna realize,

57:41.536 --> 57:44.470
that you ain't got the
stomach for this kinda thing.

57:45.371 --> 57:46.671
Now take the dough.

58:24.108 --> 58:25.708
Hey, Bryce, man, I...

58:28.912 --> 58:30.178
Fuck!

58:35.050 --> 58:36.316
Fuck! Fuck!

58:53.166 --> 58:55.333
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

59:10.348 --> 59:11.581
Oh!

59:12.749 --> 59:14.583
Jesus Christ, you scared
the shit outta me!

59:14.585 --> 59:15.650
Fuck are you doing?

59:15.652 --> 59:16.984
I'm planning my great escape.

59:16.986 --> 59:18.185
What the fuck
does it look like?

59:18.986 --> 59:20.486
Oh, it stinks!

59:20.488 --> 59:22.154
Wanna wipe my ass?
You look eager!

59:26.926 --> 59:28.626
-Paula.
-Hey, Eddie.

59:28.628 --> 59:29.994
How are ya?

59:29.996 --> 59:31.161
A couple guys showed up,
said that, uh,

59:31.163 --> 59:32.328
they had a meeting with you so

59:32.330 --> 59:33.762
I sat them at your table.

59:33.764 --> 59:35.363
-Oh.
-They're drinking Diet Cokes.

59:35.365 --> 59:36.597
Put it on my tab.

59:36.599 --> 59:37.898
-Eddie.
-Yeah?

59:38.366 --> 59:39.899
-Thank you.
-For what?

59:40.867 --> 59:42.100
Thank you.

59:44.503 --> 59:45.803
Hey.
How are you?

59:45.805 --> 59:47.004
Hey, Eddie.
Good to see ya.

59:47.006 --> 59:48.205
-How you doin'?
-Good.

59:48.207 --> 59:49.339
Take care.

59:49.341 --> 59:51.207
Gentlemen.
Traffic, sorry.

59:51.209 --> 59:53.209
Agent Reichert.

59:53.211 --> 59:54.677
-Hey.
-What happened?

59:54.679 --> 59:56.145
-Eh, line of duty.
-Ah.

59:56.147 --> 59:58.647
This is my partner,
Agent Santos.

59:58.649 --> 01:00:00.215
-How do you do?
- Sir.

01:00:00.217 --> 01:00:01.382
-Wanna talk?
-Yeah.

01:00:01.384 --> 01:00:02.449
Let's do it.

01:00:02.883 --> 01:00:04.016
You look good, Eddie.

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:05.684
Ah, thanks, how's the wife?

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.318
Well, you know how it is.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.553
She ain't getting any younger
or any thinner.

01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:11.988
Mr. Lovato.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.456
Eddie, please.

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:15.291
Mr. Lovato, as you
may have already heard,

01:00:15.293 --> 01:00:16.725
Demetrius Flemmings'
nephew, Marques

01:00:16.727 --> 01:00:18.359
was kidnapped yesterday.

01:00:18.361 --> 01:00:19.526
You know about this?

01:00:20.294 --> 01:00:21.594
I do not.

01:00:21.795 --> 01:00:23.295
Well, the two of us
know that the two of you

01:00:23.297 --> 01:00:24.529
have past issues.

01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:25.530
I have?

01:00:25.532 --> 01:00:27.798
Sorry Eddie, we have to ask.

01:00:28.533 --> 01:00:30.567
Anything you can give
us will be a big help.

01:00:31.702 --> 01:00:34.236
Sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

01:00:34.238 --> 01:00:35.437
Hmm?

01:00:36.005 --> 01:00:37.138
<i>It's a line from Macbeth,
have you ever seen it?</i>

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.539
-No.
-No.

01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:40.040
Oh, it's my favorite play.

01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:41.241
I love it.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.375
I saw it on Broadway
with Patrick Stewart.

01:00:43.709 --> 01:00:45.843
<i>He's the bald guy from
 Star Trek, remember?</i>

01:00:45.845 --> 01:00:47.411
Yeah, he's good.

01:00:47.413 --> 01:00:49.813
Macbeth is the
king of Scotland.

01:00:49.815 --> 01:00:51.881
And he's told by
a bunch of witches

01:00:51.883 --> 01:00:53.883
that he can never
be killed by a man

01:00:53.885 --> 01:00:55.651
that was born from a woman.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.920
So he believes these
witches, why wouldn't he?

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:01.522
And so when his
rival challenges him

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:04.358
to a fight to the
death, he accepts.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.394
And, phew, one fell swoop of
a sword, he's decapitated.

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:10.263
Turns out that the
guy who killed him

01:01:10.265 --> 01:01:12.765
was taken from
his mother's womb,

01:01:12.767 --> 01:01:15.834
like a C-section,
not natural birth,

01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:19.770
so technically, he is
not born of a woman.

01:01:21.572 --> 01:01:24.040
I'm sorry Eddie,
we are not...

01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:25.074
We are not connecting.

01:01:25.076 --> 01:01:26.575
Hmm.

01:01:36.017 --> 01:01:38.184
Sometimes things
aren't as they seem.

01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:23.394
You ready?

01:03:03.933 --> 01:03:05.033
Hey!

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.533
Tyrone, my man.

01:03:06.535 --> 01:03:07.867
Got somethin' for ya.

01:03:11.637 --> 01:03:12.770
Hello?

01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:22.645
Yeah, all right.

01:03:22.647 --> 01:03:24.045
Okay.

01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:28.282
Well, who was that,
what was that?

01:03:29.951 --> 01:03:31.951
Janie's fucking
around on me, man.

01:03:33.453 --> 01:03:34.619
Fuck.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.453
Are you sure?

01:03:36.455 --> 01:03:37.987
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

01:03:37.989 --> 01:03:39.688
He said he's got
fucking photos.

01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:41.955
-Damn.
-Sorry about that.

01:03:44.525 --> 01:03:45.791
You know what the
fucked up thing is?

01:03:45.793 --> 01:03:47.325
I fucking wanted to catch her.

01:03:47.327 --> 01:03:49.460
I mean, how fucking
sick is that?

01:03:49.462 --> 01:03:51.528
Come on, don't do that
to yourself, you know?

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.896
I mean, what kind
of fucking sick individual

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:55.864
is happy that his fucking
fiancé's getting banged

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:58.932
in the back seat of a car
that he's fucking paying for?

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:01.701
You didn't put it
in her name, at least?

01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:03.235
Noah, really?

01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:05.470
Listen to me, and stop
fucking talking, I'm serious.

01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:07.038
Okay, okay.
-Okay?

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.205
All right.

01:04:11.642 --> 01:04:13.109
You know, you
spend every fucking

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.210
waking minute going through
their fucking phone,

01:04:15.212 --> 01:04:16.711
going through their
fucking email,

01:04:16.713 --> 01:04:18.312
going through their
fucking laundry.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:20.247
I mean anything,
anything to fucking

01:04:20.249 --> 01:04:22.082
nail the fucking
bitch to the wall,

01:04:22.084 --> 01:04:23.516
and I fucking knew it!

01:04:23.518 --> 01:04:25.518
I wanted it, I
wanted to be right,

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.152
and I fucking knew it!

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:28.653
She's a fucking whore!

01:04:29.254 --> 01:04:30.754
Zach, you probably
don't wanna to hear this,

01:04:30.756 --> 01:04:32.589
but at least you
got some closure now, you know?

01:04:34.391 --> 01:04:36.024
You know what
the detective said?

01:04:36.026 --> 01:04:38.860
85 percent of his
clients who think

01:04:38.862 --> 01:04:40.995
that their wives are
fucking around on them,

01:04:41.863 --> 01:04:42.963
they are!

01:04:44.899 --> 01:04:46.199
At least there's some comfort

01:04:46.201 --> 01:04:47.300
in knowing
you're in the majority.

01:04:48.902 --> 01:04:51.403
Noah, just stop
fucking talking!

01:04:51.405 --> 01:04:53.071
What, I'm just trying
to make him feel better.

01:04:57.075 --> 01:05:00.743
The way I look at it,
life is a zero sum game.

01:05:01.745 --> 01:05:03.445
It's one of the
evils of humanity.

01:05:03.612 --> 01:05:05.913
We all win somethin' and lose
somethin' at the same time.

01:05:06.948 --> 01:05:08.748
Okay, so you're Socrates now?

01:05:09.616 --> 01:05:11.249
No, I'm simply saying
that we all brought

01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:13.951
into this world with
a sheet of columns.

01:05:15.086 --> 01:05:16.453
And the shit you
do in one column

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:17.687
has to be balanced
out with the shit

01:05:17.689 --> 01:05:19.288
you do in the other.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.089
What does that have
to do with anything?

01:05:22.257 --> 01:05:23.690
Okay, stay with me and
see if what I'm saying

01:05:23.692 --> 01:05:25.191
don't start making
perfect sense.

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:26.592
All right.

01:05:26.594 --> 01:05:27.693
Me.

01:05:28.127 --> 01:05:29.627
I'm here, cuffed to this
chair, because of some

01:05:29.629 --> 01:05:33.130
malevolent act that
I did out there.

01:05:33.132 --> 01:05:35.031
And, as you can imagine,
given my line of work,

01:05:35.033 --> 01:05:36.932
that side of the column
is pretty god damned full,

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.867
so I'm fairly certain
that your friend here

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:42.136
did something on his
end, let's just say

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:45.105
something that he's
not terribly proud of

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.806
to deserve what's
happening to him.

01:05:46.808 --> 01:05:48.440
Actually, you're
very wrong, Marques,

01:05:48.442 --> 01:05:49.808
because he was faithful.

01:05:50.276 --> 01:05:51.943
No, it don't have to be that.

01:05:52.644 --> 01:05:53.977
It can be anything,
I'm talking about

01:05:53.979 --> 01:05:55.611
fucking karma, here.

01:05:55.613 --> 01:05:56.945
Yeah, how about
sometimes things

01:05:56.947 --> 01:05:59.347
just don't add up in the world?

01:05:59.715 --> 01:06:01.782
And you just get
fucked over either way,

01:06:01.784 --> 01:06:03.550
no matter what you do.
What about that?

01:06:04.151 --> 01:06:06.652
Nah.
There's always something.

01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:08.787
There isn't anything.

01:06:09.155 --> 01:06:12.357
Come on, Zachary,
there's something.

01:06:12.758 --> 01:06:15.726
Your fucking bullshit theory
doesn't apply here, Buddha!

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.093
Okay, so you want
us all to believe

01:06:17.095 --> 01:06:18.727
that you some kind of saint?

01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:20.695
I don't give a fuck
what you believe!

01:06:20.962 --> 01:06:22.762
See the thing is, you
can deny culpability

01:06:22.764 --> 01:06:25.798
all you want, but
the way I see it,

01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:29.600
based on laws of balance,
you might as well have

01:06:29.602 --> 01:06:32.169
dressed your little cupcake
in some lace garters,

01:06:32.171 --> 01:06:34.738
and put her pussy up
for auction yourself.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:35.905
Shut the fuck up!

01:06:35.907 --> 01:06:37.239
Shut the fuck up!

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.340
Hey, I'm just trying to give
your friend some clarity, here.

01:06:39.342 --> 01:06:41.008
Let me give you
some fucking clarity,

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:42.376
you fucking piece of shit!

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:45.144
A man who discovers
that his fucking fiancé

01:06:45.146 --> 01:06:48.847
is cheating on him six weeks
before the god damn wedding,

01:06:49.148 --> 01:06:51.716
is probably not a guy
you want to fuck with!

01:06:52.084 --> 01:06:54.318
That man would probably
have no fucking issue

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.853
fucking blowing your
fucking stupid face

01:06:56.855 --> 01:06:59.355
right across the fucking floor!

01:06:59.357 --> 01:07:00.856
Zach, Jesus
Christ, take it easy.

01:07:01.591 --> 01:07:02.657
I'm gonna fucking shoot him.

01:07:02.659 --> 01:07:04.091
Calm down, man!

01:07:04.592 --> 01:07:05.792
Give me the gun.

01:07:05.794 --> 01:07:07.426
Zach, give me the gun.

01:07:07.428 --> 01:07:08.460
He's trying to fuck
with you, and he's

01:07:08.462 --> 01:07:09.727
trying to get in your head.

01:07:11.496 --> 01:07:13.029
I'm sorry.

01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:14.196
I'm so sorry.

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:15.297
Be cool.

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:17.265
Man, I'm sorry.

01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:19.533
I'm not having a good day.

01:07:21.202 --> 01:07:22.936
This conversation
is fucking over,

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.337
do you understand me?

01:07:24.604 --> 01:07:25.704
No problem.

01:07:29.341 --> 01:07:30.741
I didn't mean to upset anybody.

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:33.710
It's just a healthy exchange
of views, that's all.

01:07:37.648 --> 01:07:39.315
All I was trying to do
is shed some sunlight

01:07:39.317 --> 01:07:42.017
as to what would warrant
some strange guy's jizz

01:07:42.019 --> 01:07:44.886
all over his little
princess' tits, that's all.

01:07:59.665 --> 01:08:00.698
-Shit, calm down!
-Get the fuck off me!

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:01.899
He's fucking with me!

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.533
Jesus Christ, you're
gonna fucking kill him.

01:08:03.535 --> 01:08:04.867
What are you doing?

01:08:04.869 --> 01:08:06.101
I'm fine.

01:08:06.735 --> 01:08:08.368
Yeah, you're fine, my
fucking ass, you're fine.

01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:10.936
Jesus Christ. Ah.

01:08:12.638 --> 01:08:14.405
What the hell is that?

01:08:26.017 --> 01:08:27.450
It's a god damn microphone.

01:08:28.318 --> 01:08:29.384
Holy shit!

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:30.818
He's fucking wired!

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.986
-What?
-He's wired, Noah, like on TV?

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.520
You mean he's been
recording us this whole time?

01:08:35.523 --> 01:08:36.854
Somebody has been!

01:08:36.857 --> 01:08:38.156
You see anybody?

01:08:38.158 --> 01:08:40.158
-No.
-Fucking screwed.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.658
Who knows how far
that signal travels!

01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:43.460
Warren, smash that
thing, smash it!

01:08:50.067 --> 01:08:51.232
Noah, you can stop.

01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:53.934
All right, all right!

01:08:53.935 --> 01:08:55.135
Fuck!

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:57.136
What the fuck?

01:08:57.670 --> 01:08:59.671
Who the fuck is out there,
you fucking son of a bitch?

01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:00.971
Who's listening to us?

01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:06.542
Guys, I vote we get the fuck
outta here, right fucking now.

01:09:06.545 --> 01:09:07.676
Yeah, I agree.

01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.578
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up.

01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:11.813
Let's think about this.

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:15.816
Now, if someone
was listening in,

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:18.783
they woulda came through
that door, guns blazing,

01:09:18.786 --> 01:09:20.618
long before now, no?

01:09:20.621 --> 01:09:21.720
Zach's right.

01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:23.054
We'd already be dead.

01:09:23.055 --> 01:09:24.188
And...

01:09:27.358 --> 01:09:29.692
Ho, ho, ho.

01:09:30.593 --> 01:09:32.594
- Oh, that's good.
- What?

01:09:32.595 --> 01:09:33.861
That's fucking good.

01:09:34.362 --> 01:09:35.462
What's good?

01:09:36.095 --> 01:09:37.296
You don't get it?

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:39.231
He wasn't wearing
the wire for us.

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:40.932
He was wearing a
wire for his friends.

01:09:43.634 --> 01:09:46.102
I'd be willing to bet money
that this fucking piece of shit

01:09:46.104 --> 01:09:48.470
is working for some
branch of law enforcement,

01:09:48.473 --> 01:09:51.573
most likely the FBI, they
got him all fucking wired up.

01:09:51.576 --> 01:09:54.577
So he can eavesdrop on
his fucking drug-pedaling

01:09:54.579 --> 01:09:56.345
gangster fucking friends.

01:09:56.713 --> 01:09:58.447
And put them all behind bars.

01:09:58.449 --> 01:09:59.614
Isn't that right?

01:10:00.983 --> 01:10:02.383
Isn't that right?

01:10:03.385 --> 01:10:05.219
You fucking piece of shit.

01:10:06.254 --> 01:10:07.687
Holy shit.

01:10:07.921 --> 01:10:09.321
You say he's an informant?

01:10:09.588 --> 01:10:11.989
Actually in his circles,
it's better known as a rat.

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:13.523
Or a snitch.

01:10:13.924 --> 01:10:16.258
Or maybe just a plain
cock-sucking weasel.

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.627
So back in the alley
there, that was probably--

01:10:18.629 --> 01:10:20.895
Most likely Feds chasing us.

01:10:21.463 --> 01:10:22.930
We probably interrupted
one of their

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:25.364
recording sessions
when we showed up.

01:10:26.632 --> 01:10:27.999
I do not feel well.

01:10:35.506 --> 01:10:39.841
Do you guys have any idea
how altogether fucked you are?

01:10:40.475 --> 01:10:43.243
I think you're
confused on who's

01:10:43.245 --> 01:10:45.545
in the fucking
doghouse right now.

01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:47.846
Now I'm not sure if
there's an official

01:10:47.848 --> 01:10:50.615
gangsta handbook,
but I'm dead certain

01:10:50.617 --> 01:10:52.783
that if there was one,
it would frown heavily upon

01:10:52.785 --> 01:10:55.685
you recording conversations
with your gangsta friends.

01:10:56.153 --> 01:10:58.354
I bet Uncle Demetrius
is gonna be tickled pink

01:10:58.356 --> 01:11:00.522
when he finds out
about your bureau buddies.

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:04.925
You guys look umm,
pleased with yourself.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:06.692
I wouldn't say pleased.

01:11:07.427 --> 01:11:11.429
What makes you think
my uncle, or anyone

01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:15.098
from my side of the
fence is gonna believe

01:11:15.532 --> 01:11:18.934
an inconceivable lie like that?

01:11:21.971 --> 01:11:23.204
What you gonna do?

01:11:25.273 --> 01:11:26.873
You gonna show him that mush?

01:11:31.379 --> 01:11:33.212
And you clowns
were worried about

01:11:33.214 --> 01:11:34.813
what I was gonna do to you.

01:11:34.815 --> 01:11:36.114
Have you ever bumped heads with

01:11:36.315 --> 01:11:37.615
the type of cats at the
other end of this wire?

01:11:38.316 --> 01:11:39.516
Huh?

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:41.250
It's what's known as
a task force, fellas.

01:11:41.718 --> 01:11:43.018
Those motherfuckers
have killed

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.286
more motherfuckers than...

01:11:45.288 --> 01:11:47.021
...than you've had hand jobs.

01:11:48.156 --> 01:11:50.557
And you just kidnapped
they star witness.

01:11:50.559 --> 01:11:52.892
In the middle

01:11:53.326 --> 01:11:57.929
of a six-month,
round-the-clock surveillance!

01:12:01.832 --> 01:12:04.099
You guys
are fucking fertilizer.

01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:07.301
Hey, Eddie.

01:12:08.002 --> 01:12:10.036
Everything's set,
time and place.

01:12:10.038 --> 01:12:11.303
All right, let's call 'em.

01:12:21.579 --> 01:12:22.779
Eddie.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.114
Yeah, good news,
uh, ready for pick up.

01:12:26.549 --> 01:12:27.815
You're ready for pick up?

01:12:30.318 --> 01:12:31.951
Well, there's been a
change of plan, Eddie.

01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:33.552
What are you talking
about, there's been

01:12:33.554 --> 01:12:35.086
a change of plans?

01:12:35.854 --> 01:12:37.954
The kind where I
fucking call you back!

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:40.722
What...

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:42.090
motherfucker hung up on me!

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:43.724
Get the fuck out.

01:12:44.425 --> 01:12:45.558
You shouldn't
have hung up on him,

01:12:46.059 --> 01:12:47.559
Why'd you hang up on him?
You shouldn't have--

01:12:47.561 --> 01:12:48.626
Shut up, Noah.

01:12:48.927 --> 01:12:50.060
I can't hear myself
fucking think.

01:12:50.062 --> 01:12:51.394
Oh, sure, no, that's great.

01:12:51.396 --> 01:12:52.895
Guys, let's give
Zach time to think.

01:12:52.897 --> 01:12:54.396
What the fuck are you doing?

01:12:54.563 --> 01:12:55.763
Don't you think that
before you hang up on a guy

01:12:55.765 --> 01:12:57.264
who's most likely gonna see us

01:12:57.431 --> 01:12:58.531
sleeping with the fucking
fishes, you should of

01:12:58.533 --> 01:13:00.065
consulted with us first?

01:13:00.067 --> 01:13:01.533
Are you fucking yelling at me?

01:13:01.535 --> 01:13:03.101
Yes I'm fucking
yelling at you!

01:13:03.103 --> 01:13:04.836
Whoa guys, yelling won't help!

01:13:04.838 --> 01:13:06.571
I'm just trying to have
some fucking input here.

01:13:06.573 --> 01:13:07.838
We wouldn't even be
in this fucking mess

01:13:08.072 --> 01:13:09.405
if it wasn't for you,
shut the fuck up!

01:13:09.407 --> 01:13:10.606
Shut up!

01:13:11.007 --> 01:13:12.240
Eddie Lovato?

01:13:12.242 --> 01:13:13.674
Oh, great, fucking great.

01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:16.776
That's who's behind all this?

01:13:16.778 --> 01:13:18.477
Why he got beef with me?

01:13:19.679 --> 01:13:21.079
What the fuck he want with me?

01:13:22.214 --> 01:13:23.681
Do me the decency
of a straight answer

01:13:23.683 --> 01:13:25.115
with the fucking state I'm in.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.650
Fine, have it your way.

01:13:29.184 --> 01:13:30.417
What's the difference?

01:13:31.419 --> 01:13:33.386
Y'all wrote your
own obits anyway.

01:13:33.388 --> 01:13:34.887
You just shut the fuck up?

01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:36.188
Yeah, shut the fuck
up, you fucking love

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:37.589
hearing yourself fucking talk!

01:13:37.591 --> 01:13:38.923
You shut the fuck up!

01:13:38.925 --> 01:13:40.591
You think you a lion?

01:13:40.593 --> 01:13:41.792
You a mouse!

01:13:42.059 --> 01:13:43.959
I dare you to untie
me, motherfucker!

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:47.462
--Everybody, shut the fuck up!

01:13:48.096 --> 01:13:49.296
Shut up!

01:13:49.298 --> 01:13:50.864
Jesus Christ!

01:13:50.866 --> 01:13:52.632
I'm gonna tape
his fucking mouth.

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.640
Yeah, okay, great.

01:14:02.642 --> 01:14:04.274
Yeah, I know where it is.

01:14:05.409 --> 01:14:07.009
All right, I appreciate it.

01:14:07.744 --> 01:14:08.844
Thanks.

01:14:10.213 --> 01:14:11.313
Who was that?

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.381
That was a guy I
did some work with

01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:14.882
a couple months back.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.483
He works at the
Treasury Department.

01:14:16.817 --> 01:14:18.384
He says our only
course of action

01:14:18.386 --> 01:14:21.487
right now at this moment,
is to turn ourselves in.

01:14:22.055 --> 01:14:23.155
Voluntarily.

01:14:23.723 --> 01:14:25.056
What about him?

01:14:25.058 --> 01:14:26.490
If he is who he thinks he is,

01:14:26.492 --> 01:14:28.458
they'll be happy
to have him back.

01:14:29.226 --> 01:14:30.492
Where's the car?

01:14:30.494 --> 01:14:31.626
It's out back.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.160
All right, well, give
me the fucking keys.

01:14:33.561 --> 01:14:34.661
What about Eddie?
What about his niece?

01:14:34.663 --> 01:14:36.396
Fuck Eddie, fuck his niece!

01:14:36.398 --> 01:14:38.698
We're going to the FBI,
this ends right now!

01:14:38.899 --> 01:14:40.466
This is it, this is
it, we're going to jail.

01:14:40.468 --> 01:14:41.934
We're going to jail
for God knows how long.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.001
And when we get out,
Eddie'll kill us,

01:14:43.003 --> 01:14:44.168
or maybe Marques'll kill us.

01:14:44.502 --> 01:14:45.468
Or maybe we'll just
die in jail, butt raped

01:14:46.002 --> 01:14:46.835
with a bullet in the
back of our head.

01:14:46.837 --> 01:14:47.969
Thanks, Zach, fuck!

01:14:48.303 --> 01:14:49.303
I agree with Noah,
we need to stick to

01:14:49.305 --> 01:14:50.804
the original plan, Zach.

01:14:50.806 --> 01:14:52.038
Did you hear what I just said?

01:14:52.639 --> 01:14:54.106
I can't believe you're not
backing me up on this, Bryce!

01:14:54.108 --> 01:14:55.440
What do you think
Eddie's gonna do to us?

01:14:55.442 --> 01:14:57.842
Look, this is
a true life line.

01:14:58.777 --> 01:15:00.144
Trust me!

01:15:02.013 --> 01:15:03.580
Give me the god damn car keys.

01:15:04.114 --> 01:15:05.881
Give me the god damn car keys!

01:15:06.115 --> 01:15:07.348
Give him the fucking keys.

01:15:09.584 --> 01:15:11.151
I'm gonna pull the car around.

01:15:11.752 --> 01:15:12.852
All right?

01:15:12.854 --> 01:15:13.919
This is a good thing.

01:15:14.587 --> 01:15:15.820
I'll be right back.

01:15:15.822 --> 01:15:17.354
Get Socrates ready.

01:15:33.637 --> 01:15:35.137
You hung up on me.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:39.507
Uh, Mr. Lovato, I mean, Eddie.

01:15:39.509 --> 01:15:40.875
I was gonna call you back.

01:15:52.687 --> 01:15:53.953
Hello, Marques.

01:15:53.955 --> 01:15:55.187
Fuck you.

01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:57.155
Sounds like he's
happy to see us.

01:15:57.157 --> 01:15:58.556
How'd you find us?

01:15:58.857 --> 01:16:00.691
What's it matter? The important
thing is, we're here.

01:16:00.693 --> 01:16:02.059
You boys did good.

01:16:02.061 --> 01:16:03.527
Your parents should be proud.

01:16:03.861 --> 01:16:06.195
So I just have one little
favor to ask of you,

01:16:06.197 --> 01:16:07.863
one little detail,
and we're done.

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:09.531
Consider the slate clean.

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:11.031
That's it, it's over?

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.198
Yeah.

01:16:12.465 --> 01:16:13.598
No need in discussing
that this guy

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:15.865
had a fucking wire on him
when we picked him up?

01:16:18.034 --> 01:16:19.868
You already knew
that, didn't you?

01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:21.569
Look Zach, I think the
less we know the better.

01:16:21.571 --> 01:16:22.803
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:24.537
Zach, Noah's right, let's
just get this over with.

01:16:26.406 --> 01:16:27.906
What's left?

01:16:27.908 --> 01:16:30.842
Okay, I need each of you
to put a bullet in him.

01:16:30.844 --> 01:16:31.943
What?

01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:33.544
Yes.

01:16:34.012 --> 01:16:35.245
Now I know you're asking
why, but I'm gonna give you

01:16:35.247 --> 01:16:36.813
that two-part answer, okay?

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:45.621
Okay one, my niece, done,
safe, I'm happy, phew.

01:16:46.055 --> 01:16:47.388
All right?

01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:49.323
Uh. But I do not
need Marques alive.

01:16:50.224 --> 01:16:52.091
Okay, and two, and this
is for your protection

01:16:52.093 --> 01:16:53.759
as well as for mine.

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:56.160
I can't have you guys
talking about this.

01:16:56.162 --> 01:16:58.262
My feeling is that
accessory to murder

01:16:58.264 --> 01:17:00.931
is the greatest
motivation for you guys

01:17:00.933 --> 01:17:02.399
to shut the fuck up.

01:17:03.033 --> 01:17:05.734
Eddie, this is none of
our business, you know?

01:17:05.736 --> 01:17:07.569
I mean we would
never say anything.

01:17:07.571 --> 01:17:11.172
I know that you
wouldn't talk about it,

01:17:11.174 --> 01:17:13.174
but I need an insurance policy.

01:17:13.176 --> 01:17:15.276
Come on!
It's simple.

01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:18.578
So, all you have to do is
decide who's gonna be first.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.580
And you guys can decide
amongst yourselves,

01:17:20.582 --> 01:17:21.981
I don't really care
who's first.

01:17:22.749 --> 01:17:24.116
Let's go, come on.

01:17:24.118 --> 01:17:26.017
- Let's do it.

01:17:31.255 --> 01:17:32.388
Noah, you go first.

01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:33.889
-What?
-You go first.

01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:34.990
What, no!

01:17:35.358 --> 01:17:36.424
You fucking got us
into this fucking mess!

01:17:36.426 --> 01:17:37.525
You're going first!

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:38.659
No!

01:17:39.193 --> 01:17:40.893
It's only fucking fair
that you fucking go first!

01:17:40.895 --> 01:17:42.027
No!

01:17:42.294 --> 01:17:43.727
No?

01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:45.562
You fucking little
fucking parasite!

01:17:45.564 --> 01:17:46.863
Fuck you, Zach!

01:17:47.097 --> 01:17:49.264
Fucking shoot him, you
little fucking parasite!

01:17:49.266 --> 01:17:50.965
We're not in
high school anymore,

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:52.399
you can't just order me around!

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.134
If you don't
fucking shoot him,

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.402
I swear to God I'm
gonna fucking shoot you!

01:17:56.404 --> 01:17:58.070
Zach, what the fuck,
put the gun down!

01:17:58.072 --> 01:18:00.272
You wanna fucking
shoot him Bryce?

01:18:00.274 --> 01:18:01.940
Leave Noah alone, put
the fucking gun down.

01:18:01.942 --> 01:18:03.141
Fuck you!

01:18:05.611 --> 01:18:09.279
If you don't shoot him, by
the time I count to three,

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.114
I swear to God I'm
gonna fucking shoot you.

01:18:12.116 --> 01:18:13.215
Zach!

01:18:13.549 --> 01:18:15.149
I am not your
fucking bitch anymore!

01:18:15.151 --> 01:18:16.917
Yes you are, you
are my fucking bitch!

01:18:16.919 --> 01:18:18.118
Fuck you!

01:18:18.285 --> 01:18:19.218
You have always
been my fucking bitch!

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.886
Test me!
One!

01:18:22.955 --> 01:18:24.555
-Two!
-Fuck you!

01:18:50.009 --> 01:18:52.310
Jesus fucking Christ, Warren!

01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:54.311
Oh, my fucking God
he's fucking dead,

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.513
he's fucking dead, there's
a fucking dead guy!

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:57.680
Warren, are you okay?

01:18:57.847 --> 01:18:59.447
-What the fuck?
-Far from fucking okay.

01:18:59.449 --> 01:19:00.548
Fuck!

01:19:01.283 --> 01:19:02.650
Uh. Hey, fellas?

01:19:02.652 --> 01:19:04.385
We don't have all night.
Who's next?

01:19:04.819 --> 01:19:06.319
Ah, come on!

01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:07.420
Mr. Lovato?

01:19:08.188 --> 01:19:09.588
Noah, yes.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:11.690
Technically Warren
shot Marques three times

01:19:11.692 --> 01:19:13.458
and since there's four
of us, I was wondering

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.493
maybe if you would
consider the possibility

01:19:15.495 --> 01:19:17.861
of just one of us left
having to shoot him?

01:19:19.363 --> 01:19:20.563
That's not possible.

01:19:21.765 --> 01:19:23.098
Okay,
there you have it.

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.799
We need another volunteer.

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.100
Let's go.

01:19:26.102 --> 01:19:27.367
Let's do it quickly, men.

01:19:28.168 --> 01:19:29.268
Let's get it over with.

01:19:29.702 --> 01:19:32.103
Somebody pick up that
gun, or you're all gonna

01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:34.905
wake up tomorrow with
a fucking toe tag.

01:19:35.273 --> 01:19:36.873
We don't have all
night boys, come on.

01:20:29.187 --> 01:20:30.453
Marques...

01:20:31.922 --> 01:20:33.255
was a disappointment.

01:21:01.016 --> 01:21:04.251
Well, Noah, friends
think I should of tossed
you in with him.

01:21:04.418 --> 01:21:05.718
What do you think?

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.785
Really?

01:21:06.787 --> 01:21:09.354
Well, I think if they got
to know me a little better,

01:21:09.356 --> 01:21:10.822
they'd think differently.

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:15.592
I'm sorry you had to go
through all this, Mr. Flemmings.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.694
But there's a lesson
to be learned here today.

01:21:19.128 --> 01:21:21.929
You fuck people over, you end
up at the bottom of the lake.

01:21:27.267 --> 01:21:30.869
So do I get the money or
do I end up in the lake?

01:21:39.411 --> 01:21:40.844
<i> And thanks for
 agreeing to meet me</i>

01:21:41.245 --> 01:21:42.311
<i> on such short notice, I
 know you're a busy guy,</i>

01:21:42.612 --> 01:21:44.279
so you know, I
appreciate the gesture.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.180
I think you'll like this.

01:21:48.716 --> 01:21:50.550
So a friend of mine
works for the FBI.

01:21:52.452 --> 01:21:54.118
<i> White collar crime division.</i>

01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:58.021
Hey, you guys ever
hear of Bidexco?

01:21:58.255 --> 01:22:00.256
<i> A startup
 pharmaceutical company</i>

01:22:00.258 --> 01:22:02.224
<i> was under heavy surveillance
 by federal authorities...</i>

01:22:02.226 --> 01:22:03.792
<i> And one of the
 guys does a coffee run,</i>

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:05.426
<i> brings my pal
 someone else's latte</i>

01:22:05.428 --> 01:22:07.161
<i> with six spoonful's of sugar.</i>

01:22:08.496 --> 01:22:10.296
<i> So he walks it over to the
 agent with a sweet tooth</i>

01:22:10.298 --> 01:22:12.231
<i> who so happens to be
 working with an informant</i>

01:22:12.233 --> 01:22:13.765
<i> who's spending
 all his afternoons</i>

01:22:13.767 --> 01:22:15.633
<i>putting his associates on tape.</i>

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.233
<i> You wanna
 climb the corporate ladder,</i>

01:22:17.235 --> 01:22:19.501
keep your motherfucking
mouth shut!

01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:21.703
<i> You know what
 keeps me up at night?</i>

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:23.771
<i> Knowing that when this cock
 sucker's done testifying,</i>

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:24.805
we're gonna place him
in witness protection

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:26.640
and buy him an Escalade.

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.875
So when no one's
looking, why don't you just

01:22:29.109 --> 01:22:30.542
plant one in the back
of his fucking head?

01:22:33.145 --> 01:22:35.646
Noah, you do realize we're
no longer in Iraq, right?

01:22:36.981 --> 01:22:38.848
But the guy
they're really after,

01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:41.383
the big prize,
Demetrius Flemmings.

01:22:42.351 --> 01:22:45.719
Very popular with the DEA
Special Operations Division.

01:22:47.088 --> 01:22:49.656
Now, from what I'm
told, the only thing

01:22:49.658 --> 01:22:52.191
more important to
Flemmings than money

01:22:52.193 --> 01:22:53.559
is his family.

01:22:56.963 --> 01:23:00.229
Two million dollars cash
to whoever finds my nephew.

01:23:02.165 --> 01:23:04.900
And that's why I have this.

01:23:12.708 --> 01:23:14.108
<i> Let me play it for you.</i>

01:23:14.843 --> 01:23:17.176
<i> I think you'll agree,
the sound quality is excellent.</i>

01:23:19.045 --> 01:23:21.279
<i> Nice work, Marques,</i>

01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:22.613
<i> I can't wait to see
 your uncle's face</i>

01:23:22.615 --> 01:23:24.481
<i> when we play this back
 in court.</i>

01:23:24.483 --> 01:23:25.882
<i> Yeah,
 fuck you Detective.</i>

01:23:26.049 --> 01:23:27.082
<i> Next time,
 try taking this thing off</i>

01:23:27.084 --> 01:23:29.250
<i> without taking my
 fucking skin with it.</i>

01:23:30.018 --> 01:23:31.517
And that's where you come in.

01:23:33.786 --> 01:23:35.052
We're looking for Tyrone.

01:23:35.353 --> 01:23:36.953
Do you know where
we can find Tyrone?

01:23:36.955 --> 01:23:38.921
So, uh, Eddie says you
got an address for us.

01:23:39.155 --> 01:23:40.288
Hey, hey, hey!

01:23:40.522 --> 01:23:42.422
Tyrone, my man.
Got somethin' for ya.

01:23:44.658 --> 01:23:46.291
<i> Nice work, Marques.</i>

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.060
<i> when they're playing
 this back in court.</i>

01:23:49.327 --> 01:23:50.660
<i> Yeah, fuck you Detective.</i>

01:23:50.662 --> 01:23:51.927
<i> Next time, try
 taking this thing off</i>

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.928
<i> without taking my
 fucking skin with it.</i>

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.563
<i> The way I see it,
 there's a lot of money</i>

01:23:56.565 --> 01:23:57.764
<i> to be made here.</i>

01:23:58.165 --> 01:24:00.866
<i> I get a third, my Army
 buddy gets a third...</i>

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.633
Hoo-rah!

01:24:02.635 --> 01:24:03.867
And you get a third.

01:24:04.835 --> 01:24:06.535
And you've always
said, failing to plan

01:24:06.537 --> 01:24:09.004
is planning to fail,
well you can rest assured

01:24:09.006 --> 01:24:10.638
that while I'm still
working out

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.907
a few last details, I will
have dotted all the i's

01:24:13.909 --> 01:24:17.410
and crossed all the
t's, you have my word.

01:24:18.678 --> 01:24:20.078
So what do you
think, Uncle Eddie?

01:24:21.013 --> 01:24:22.880
You came up with
this all by yourself?

01:24:23.882 --> 01:24:24.882
Pretty much, yeah.

01:24:26.051 --> 01:24:27.916
That's fucking awesome.

01:24:30.252 --> 01:24:31.719
<i> We say
 that the hour of death</i>

01:24:31.721 --> 01:24:33.420
<i> cannot be forecast.</i>

01:24:34.355 --> 01:24:38.057
But when we say this,
we imagine that hour

01:24:38.059 --> 01:24:41.059
to be placed in an obscure
and distant future.

01:24:43.395 --> 01:24:45.562
Do not take time for granted.

01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:48.598
There is only now.

01:24:53.836 --> 01:24:55.436
<i> Let's do this, Warren!</i>

01:24:55.438 --> 01:24:57.304
<i> All over it,
 you fucking sick fuck!</i>

01:24:58.005 --> 01:24:59.805
<i> Hey, ladies. How's it goin'?</i>

01:25:00.072 --> 01:25:01.906
-Yo, is it recording?
-Hey!

01:25:02.073 --> 01:25:03.406
<i> I'm back!</i>

01:25:05.909 --> 01:25:07.476
<i> This is fucked up, man.</i>

01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:09.444
<i> Get the fuck outta here,
 faggot!</i>

01:25:09.912 --> 01:25:11.279
<i> Jesus.</i>

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.080
<i>The man of the hour, everybody!</i>

01:25:16.717 --> 01:25:18.917
<i> Faggot!</i>

01:25:20.085 --> 01:25:23.120
<i> You know Zach
 and Matthew and I,</i>

01:25:23.122 --> 01:25:26.022
we were pretty relentless
about torturing you

01:25:26.024 --> 01:25:28.290
on a weekly basis.

01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:34.595
Twenty-two days sober.

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:35.928
No shit?

01:25:41.867 --> 01:25:43.234
<i> On the count of three!</i>

01:25:43.236 --> 01:25:44.435
<i> Everybody ready?</i>

01:25:44.803 --> 01:25:49.439
<i> -One. Two. Three!
 -One. Two. Three!</i>

01:26:03.086 --> 01:26:04.352
<i> Poodles!</i>

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.987
<i> I feel like we're in
 high school, right now!</i>

01:26:06.989 --> 01:26:08.321
<i> Right now, at this moment.</i>

01:26:08.588 --> 01:26:09.821
<i> We always fuck with him.
 He loves it!</i>

01:26:16.494 --> 01:26:20.529
I put every single one of
my clients into that stock.

01:26:21.797 --> 01:26:23.597
You're having a
pretty shitty morning.

01:26:23.599 --> 01:26:25.165
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:26.633
Sorry in advance
for making it worse.

01:26:26.635 --> 01:26:28.401
You know the man you
asked me to look into,

01:26:28.403 --> 01:26:31.771
Eddie Lovato, seven
nephews, all boys.

01:26:31.773 --> 01:26:33.072
He doesn't have a niece.

01:26:33.306 --> 01:26:34.806
Until my niece gets
back, you're gonna do

01:26:34.808 --> 01:26:36.274
exactly what I want you to do!

01:26:36.276 --> 01:26:38.276
-No niece?
-No niece.

01:26:38.278 --> 01:26:39.744
<i> You don't
 wanna see my response</i>

01:26:39.746 --> 01:26:40.711
<i> if something happens
 to her, buddy.</i>

01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:07.604
I'm not so sure that
it was an accident.

01:27:07.606 --> 01:27:09.439
Matthew called me
a couple weeks ago.

01:27:09.441 --> 01:27:11.140
<i> Matt was getting
 harassed, and he thought</i>

01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:12.541
<i> he was being followed.</i>

01:27:54.216 --> 01:27:56.417
You fucking whore.

01:28:05.159 --> 01:28:06.759
<i> How about you, Noah?
 You got a girlfriend?</i>

01:28:06.761 --> 01:28:08.827
Matter of fact I do, yeah.

01:28:08.829 --> 01:28:10.061
It's getting, well,
it's getting pretty

01:28:10.063 --> 01:28:11.495
serious actually, yeah.

01:28:11.497 --> 01:28:13.096
It's true what
they say, you know,

01:28:13.098 --> 01:28:14.263
there's someone out there
for everyone, even him.

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.166
Summer time's here, babe!

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:19.734
Jesus, Noah,
how long's it take you

01:28:19.736 --> 01:28:21.268
to pick up fucking ice cream?

01:28:37.518 --> 01:28:38.751
Good timing.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:41.986
Nice work, kid.

01:28:42.253 --> 01:28:43.286
You know, all these
years I kept you away

01:28:43.854 --> 01:28:45.087
from the family business,
'cause my sister,

01:28:45.089 --> 01:28:46.788
she wanted it that way.

01:28:47.389 --> 01:28:48.789
You know, said you
didn't have the stomach

01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:50.590
or the head for it but...

01:28:50.592 --> 01:28:52.592
Boy, was she wrong.

01:28:53.427 --> 01:28:55.127
What do you say
you come work for me?

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.729
Aw, thanks for the offer
but, uh,

01:28:57.731 --> 01:28:59.764
you know, I met a girl,
Uncle Eddie and she wants

01:28:59.766 --> 01:29:02.099
to get away from
all this, you know?

01:29:03.101 --> 01:29:04.468
Can you blame her?

01:29:05.102 --> 01:29:06.602
Well, you know where to come.

01:29:06.604 --> 01:29:08.303
If it doesn't work out, okay?

01:29:08.904 --> 01:29:10.571
Uncle Eddie!
Come here!

01:29:10.573 --> 01:29:12.239
I love you! Oh!

01:29:12.241 --> 01:29:13.440
Awesome, let's go.

01:29:13.442 --> 01:29:14.707
See ya, kid.
