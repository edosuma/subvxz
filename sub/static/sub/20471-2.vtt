00:20.600 --> 00:24.080
- Hit a six and the drinks are on me.
- It's a free bar and you know it.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.666
Then why are we wasting
our time out here?

00:40.552 --> 00:42.912
Mr Finch is doing a fine
job, don't you think?

00:42.938 --> 00:44.738
He's... very assertive.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.960
And they do all look extremely
good in their uniforms.

00:48.359 --> 00:51.366
- Can I help you, Sylvia?
- Lardy cake.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.560
Oh, wonderful! Let's hope it's a bit
more popular than last year.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.040
- Miss Franklin here has made sausage rolls.
- They're nothing really.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.840
They're delicious. And Mrs Hopkins
has made a Victoria sponge.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.880
Oh, that's lovely!

01:05.920 --> 01:08.760
Er, but we do have so much cake.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.160
Sure you don't want to
save it for your husband?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.446
Mr Hopkins is away on business.

01:15.314 --> 01:16.595
There we go.

01:19.092 --> 01:20.972
Come on, Geordie!
There's only one in it!

01:22.480 --> 01:24.480
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

01:24.520 --> 01:27.439
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

01:28.027 --> 01:29.868
Come on, Inspector!

01:37.520 --> 01:39.861
- Oh, bollocks.
- Sorry, Inspector.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.276
The finger.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.946
Good innings, Inspector!

01:55.113 --> 01:56.187
Zafar!

01:57.414 --> 02:01.014
Where's Zafar? Badgers you to play
then doesn't bloody turn up.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.200
- Where's that brother of yours?
- He's like the railways, always delayed.

02:05.413 --> 02:08.280
Well, maybe your railways. Nothing
wrong with ours.

02:08.649 --> 02:10.698
- Zafar!
- Sorry, skipper.

02:11.177 --> 02:12.877
I was spending a rupee.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.680
Laughing like he's
barefoot in the sunshine.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.720
Cherry Bakewell, Neil? Annie made them.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.603
Not on the boundary, Ro!

02:26.163 --> 02:28.690
You're matching.

02:28.799 --> 02:31.240
- He noticed.
- Mum made me wear it.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.240
- Mrs Towler.
- Hi, Munir.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.480
I prepared some samosas for the buffet.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.280
- People here don't like that sort of thing.
- I do.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.043
Couldn't get enough when
I rode the Darjeeling.

02:41.196 --> 02:44.276
- There's nothing wrong with a bit of spice.
- Is there not?

02:47.680 --> 02:50.960
Come on, Chambers! Score a goal!

02:52.562 --> 02:54.423
Very pretty, Sidney.

02:55.095 --> 02:56.720
It's a shame I'm spoken for.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.560
He nicked it.

03:09.224 --> 03:10.895
The... sun was in my eyes.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.611
- He got an edge!
- He's out!

03:13.217 --> 03:15.680
- I don't know how you do it in Calcutta...
- Karachi.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.034
..but an Englishman walks
if he gets an edge.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.400
Umpire? He was definitely out.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.678
Now look, Zafar, we've got rules at
this club.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.480
Skipper, I promise you,
I didn't touch it.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.336
- Well, he would say that.
- I didn't hear any contact either.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.320
All right, let's call it a day.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.598
- We're conceding. Well done, Clive.
- Geoff?

03:43.462 --> 03:47.782
If you won't play properly, there's no
point in playing at all. Everybody in!

03:48.960 --> 03:50.845
Right. Come along then.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.872
If it wasn't for his
commitment to the parish,

04:05.898 --> 04:08.898
Mr Finch would be at Lords, I imagine.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.823
- I got you a dandelion and burdock.
- Oh, thank you.

04:13.462 --> 04:16.221
- What are you having?
- A pint of ale.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.120
Mmm. I always... drink pints of ale.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.463
So, when are you coming to
the vicarage for dinner?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.134
If that was a friendly, I
don't fancy a league game.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
Hm.

04:39.614 --> 04:41.614
I'm taking this lot home.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.333
Always ends like this.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.000
Are you coming?

04:46.360 --> 04:49.720
Hm? No, I'd better stick around
in case it all kicks off.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.680
Oh, right, right. Come on then.

04:53.765 --> 04:56.125
I take it there's no point asking you.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.477
- Actually, er...
- Half the village is here.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.008
Think about how it looks
if you leave together.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.640
Wait for me behind the pavilion.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.613
Sidney?

05:23.360 --> 05:26.560
I was wondering if I might speak
to you about joining your church.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.594
You've got nothing to repent for, son.
You never touched it.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.292
Thanks, Inspector, but I
must respect the skipper.

05:32.318 --> 05:34.219
You'd be welcome to church any time.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.853
I mean joining... joining.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.160
- Would I have to be baptised?
- You mean you'd like to convert?

05:41.480 --> 05:45.000
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we
should go. I have essays to write.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.537
- Converting would suggest that I
already follow a religion. - You do.

05:48.563 --> 05:52.520
I follow the cricket, but I'd like
to know what else is out there.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.203
Excuse me.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.520
I'm... feeling a little unwell.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.410
Neil?

06:06.360 --> 06:09.160
Dad? What's wrong with everyone?

06:09.200 --> 06:10.772
It's not my lardy cake.

06:14.294 --> 06:16.102
Zafar, we should go.

06:21.477 --> 06:23.186
- Are you all right?
- Geordie?

06:23.212 --> 06:25.532
- Talk to me. What's happening?
- Mr Chambers?

06:27.966 --> 06:29.403
Mr Chambers!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.484
Mr Chambers!

06:47.223 --> 06:48.870
How long have I been asleep?

06:49.559 --> 06:51.170
30 years.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.127
My name's Gracie and my mother
sent me to look after you.

06:57.596 --> 06:59.916
- How are Leonard and Dickens?
- They'll live.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.958
Mrs Maguire said you were
all up half the night.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.786
And everyone else?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.506
A couple of people were hospitalised.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.280
- It was serious enough for Geordie
to call a village meeting. - Now?

07:12.320 --> 07:13.551
Well, I should go.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.200
Oh, don't worry. I've
already had a peek.

07:18.638 --> 07:19.840
Oh.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.192
I hope I didn't disappoint.

07:30.849 --> 07:32.474
What are you working on?

07:32.874 --> 07:37.686
Did you know that captain
Geoff Towler is a solicitor?

07:38.061 --> 07:40.799
Specialises in family law and divorce.

07:40.931 --> 07:43.186
Is it wise talking to
someone in the village?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.840
Just to get a preliminary idea.
Plus he's affordable

07:45.880 --> 07:49.172
- and he doesn't work for my father.
- You're up, are you?

07:49.652 --> 07:51.452
Vigil over then.

07:52.662 --> 07:54.662
What the dickens...?!

07:55.400 --> 07:56.929
Cover yourself up!

07:57.440 --> 07:59.440
It's not a bordello.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.320
- So it was during the tea, right?
- I play cricket every week...

08:05.360 --> 08:08.760
- Let me double check. You had lemonade...
- I'm fine, all right.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.880
- It was just the smell of other
people being sick. - Right.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.640
Next, please. - So, who...

08:19.320 --> 08:22.520
You're looking thinner.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.520
- How are you?
- Well, put it this way.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.440
I didn't score many at the cricket,

08:27.480 --> 08:30.360
but I certainly had the runs last night.

08:31.297 --> 08:35.457
- Hospital said the symptoms resembled
arsenic poisoning. - Arsenic?

08:35.695 --> 08:37.501
It was heavily diluted, don't worry.

08:37.527 --> 08:41.080
But we need to find out where it came
from... and if it was deliberate.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.560
Looks like the beer's the common factor, especially
as it was almost all the men that were ill.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.840
I've already spoken to the brewery

08:47.880 --> 08:51.440
and they assured me there have been
no other complaints on the batch.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.343
Could anyone have
tampered with the barrel?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.570
Well, who'd want to do that?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.957
Beer, cricket? It's an
attack on our way of life.

08:59.280 --> 09:03.280
- Attack?
- You know the Indian brother doesn't drink.

09:04.668 --> 09:06.983
I don't think that proves anything.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.400
- Zafar was as ill as the rest of us.
- So he says.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.918
I'll go and speak to them,

09:12.424 --> 09:15.544
just like I'll speak to everyone
else, including the brewery.

09:15.905 --> 09:17.505
Inspector...

09:19.520 --> 09:23.720
If you do visit the brewery, you may
discover I have an arrangement

09:23.760 --> 09:25.880
whereby Brian there

09:25.920 --> 09:29.640
sells me the more... vintage
bitter at a favourable rate.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.000
We've drunk it for years. There's
no way it's the cause of this.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.920
So... I wouldn't want you...
wasting your time.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.560
- Vintage bitter? - He means the stuff
that's gone, or about to go, off.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.320
But I bet he put it through the
cricket club books at full price.

09:47.436 --> 09:49.436
It hardly makes him Dr Crippen.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.880
No, but I didn't appreciate
the funny handshake.

09:54.195 --> 09:58.400
You know, rolled-up trouser leg, white
ball you're in, black ball you're out.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.946
- He's a Mason?
- Yeah. Enough of them about.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.598
Especially amongst my lot.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.035
Mr Ali.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.988
How are you?

10:15.200 --> 10:17.561
I'm awaiting an imam from Surrey.

10:18.608 --> 10:20.667
He was vomiting throughout the night.

10:20.693 --> 10:22.516
He said his throat was burning.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.711
I told him to go to the
doctor but he refused.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.753
Zafar?

10:34.475 --> 10:35.876
He won't answer you.

10:50.754 --> 10:52.793
I went to wake him this morning,

10:53.197 --> 10:56.887
he always slept late,
but he was already dead.

10:58.822 --> 11:00.822
So you moved the body to the bath?

11:00.980 --> 11:03.195
- I needed to cleanse him.
- Of what?

11:03.646 --> 11:05.646
It's Islamic custom.

11:07.060 --> 11:08.414
And the bruises?

11:09.277 --> 11:11.008
They were from a few weeks ago.

11:11.558 --> 11:14.998
He'd been out, to a pub, I suppose.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.186
Well, you know what goes
on in those places.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.435
- You weren't with him? - I'm here to study
for a job in the Pakistani civil service.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.208
I only brought him here
because my parents made me.

11:25.038 --> 11:28.920
Did he consume anything between the beer
at the cricket and you finding him?

11:29.960 --> 11:32.360
I gave him chai. Indian tea.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.200
- Could we take some for testing?
- What are you testing for?

11:35.403 --> 11:38.760
Seems strange, the rest of us
recover and he doesn't.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.341
Healthy young man like that.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.703
I cleaned it up last night.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.320
Well, we'll just need to see
what the postmortem says.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.966
Postmortem? No.

11:51.173 --> 11:53.360
He needs to be buried by sunset.

11:54.738 --> 11:57.560
Mr Ali, in both our religions...

11:57.925 --> 12:01.245
I believe the needs of the living
outweigh those of the dead.

12:01.938 --> 12:05.738
If your brother died as a result
of the illness we all suffered,

12:05.981 --> 12:09.412
then it's even more important
that we find out why.

12:12.969 --> 12:15.684
- And there was no-one else who
came round to visit? - No.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.642
No female company?

12:25.332 --> 12:27.332
Unless she was here.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.299
Annie Towler.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.703
Do come through.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.938
Kettle and biscuits, Annie.

12:47.214 --> 12:49.478
Oh, you know Neil Carver, don't you?

12:49.658 --> 12:52.200
He's come to pick Annie up.
She's working for him now.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.720
And to have a look at poor Bosey.
He's not been well the last week.

12:55.746 --> 12:56.836
_

12:56.862 --> 12:58.600
Not in front of the vicar, Rosie.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.005
Oh, God!

13:00.031 --> 13:02.000
Sorry, not God.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.953
Nothing wrong with a bit of escapism.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.320
They're naked in the first
chapter of my book.

13:10.985 --> 13:13.905
Did any of you see Zafar Ali
after the cricket yesterday?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.130
Why?

13:17.025 --> 13:19.025
I'm afraid he died last night.

13:27.057 --> 13:29.571
Er, from what? The bug we all had?

13:29.880 --> 13:33.978
- Maybe.
- No, we didn't see him. We were all here.

13:34.494 --> 13:36.480
You were in your room, weren't you?

13:40.540 --> 13:41.959
She was with me.

13:43.152 --> 13:44.398
At the surgery.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.994
We weren't feeling great either,
but we had to take an inventory.

13:49.617 --> 13:52.224
I'd say it's fairly obvious
Neil's covering for her.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.410
Yeah, but covering from who?

13:55.058 --> 13:56.658
Geoff or us?

13:57.971 --> 14:00.669
Well, Dickens hasn't been too well
since yesterday either.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.607
Maybe he needs a visit to the vet's.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.838
Looks like he's got a mild
dose of whatever we had.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.840
Give him two drops of this,

14:14.250 --> 14:17.530
twice a day, plenty of walks...

14:17.800 --> 14:19.334
and no more beer.

14:24.242 --> 14:27.242
Do you have a copy of that
inventory you did last night?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.309
Am I that bad an actor?

14:30.684 --> 14:31.949
Go on, Annie.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.214
There's no point lying.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.160
So you did visit Zafar last night?

14:39.120 --> 14:42.600
I just wanted to see if he was all
right, after you were all sick.

14:43.017 --> 14:45.457
Did you take him anything to eat, drink?

14:45.707 --> 14:47.296
Just tea. Earl Grey.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.920
- It was his favourite.
- Did you drink any?

14:51.680 --> 14:54.091
I don't drink tea. Why?

14:54.117 --> 14:57.374
You think there's more to it than
whatever made the rest of us ill?

14:57.400 --> 14:59.880
We'll see. Why did you
decide to cover for Annie?

15:01.331 --> 15:02.870
You saw Geoff at the cricket.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.313
He's hardly Zafar's biggest fan.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.757
I doubt he'd welcome his
daughter seeing him.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.038
You knew?

15:10.808 --> 15:14.928
Of course I did. Sneaking off to
the cricket pavilion at lunchtime.

15:15.124 --> 15:17.444
Him bringing in stray
cats just to see you.

15:18.086 --> 15:19.529
He was a nice lad.

15:24.449 --> 15:26.034
We were going to tell people.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.906
We were going to tell Dad.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.040
- But we were waiting...
- For what?

15:34.289 --> 15:35.708
To get married.

15:37.488 --> 15:40.128
That's why Zafar wanted
to convert, isn't it?

15:41.044 --> 15:45.240
He thought people would accept us if we
could prove how much we loved each other.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.878
The bruises on his body.

15:47.426 --> 15:48.840
Do you know how he got those?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.798
He wouldn't tell me. It
could've been anyone.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.396
It seemed like everyone was
against him in this stupid village.

15:57.930 --> 16:00.379
Is it just me or was there
something odd between them?

16:00.757 --> 16:03.520
She's just scared and upset.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.900
You know, she was the only woman
to be ill at the cricket.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.627
One way to cover up your tracks.

16:08.653 --> 16:12.160
Why would she want to kill Zafar?
I think she loved him.

16:12.435 --> 16:15.595
You can't blame them for sneaking
around, the way people are round here.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.440
You'd know. All right, it's not like
we're not short on suspects.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.538
Let's see what the postmortem finds, but
it's looking less and less like an accident.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.844
Now, what's your poison?

16:28.693 --> 16:30.600
Too soon.

16:32.368 --> 16:34.278
_

16:34.480 --> 16:36.480
Is Mr Hopkins violent towards you?

16:37.199 --> 16:38.244
No.

16:38.270 --> 16:41.174
- Does he drink?
- No more than the rest of us.

16:42.282 --> 16:43.942
Is he unfaithful?

16:45.545 --> 16:49.745
I suppose he may have had dalliances
while we've been apart.

16:49.840 --> 16:54.281
- Anything you can prove? - I don't want to
villainise him. I just want to divorce him.

16:54.307 --> 16:56.071
And for that you need reasons.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.927
If they're not going to be your
reasons, they're going to be his.

16:59.530 --> 17:03.077
And I'm assuming you don't
want those to come to light.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.480
Oh, come now. We've all seen

17:07.520 --> 17:10.217
the late-night bicycle
rides with Mr Chambers.

17:10.470 --> 17:14.220
Mr Chambers is an old friend.
I went to school with his sister.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.460
Which mitigates you how?

17:20.079 --> 17:22.680
You do recognise the
gravity of the situation?

17:22.720 --> 17:26.240
If you go through with this and your
husband decides to put up a fight,

17:26.388 --> 17:28.789
you will be branded as a whore.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.480
You'll be stigmatised,
as will your daughter.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.280
And, given the church's
position on divorce,

17:36.320 --> 17:39.423
I'd be very careful about any
relationship with Mr Chambers...

17:40.157 --> 17:42.157
if you want him to keep his job.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.120
I told you to be more careful.

17:53.529 --> 17:55.880
Well, I'll leave you to it.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.501
No, stay.

17:57.850 --> 17:59.234
And close the door.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.440
- Archdeacon.
- I hear that you represented the parish

18:07.480 --> 18:11.400
- with distinction at the cricket yesterday.
- Oh, I... I tried my best.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.724
Leonard made a fine umpire.

18:14.338 --> 18:15.381
Wonderful.

18:17.384 --> 18:20.960
Umpiring is very much
like being a clergyman,

18:21.244 --> 18:24.240
enforcing the rules, setting an example.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.800
I was more of a footballer myself.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.502
Goalkeeper.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.400
I tried not to let anything get past me.

18:35.160 --> 18:39.560
I understand you were accompanied
to the cricket by a married woman.

18:40.316 --> 18:41.734
Amanda Hopkins.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.547
She's an old friend of mine.

18:44.764 --> 18:47.924
And her husband is comfortable
with your relationship?

18:50.800 --> 18:54.040
Er, I didn't realise that there was
an eleventh commandment,

18:54.634 --> 18:56.594
thou shalt not be friends.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.400
Mrs Maguire is married. Should
we avoid being seen with her?

19:09.080 --> 19:12.286
Well, I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Hopkins
are currently separated.

19:12.717 --> 19:14.177
What a shame.

19:15.678 --> 19:18.960
It's fortunate she has a friend
in the church to counsel her

19:19.000 --> 19:22.360
in the institution of
holy matrimony. Hm?

19:23.200 --> 19:27.680
"Those whom God hath joined together...
let no man put asunder."

19:31.181 --> 19:32.508
Indeed.

19:33.357 --> 19:34.823
Thank you, Archdeacon.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.474
If that's all?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.560
You must help him, Mr Finch.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.970
Sometimes it's not just the flock
that need a shepherd.

19:53.177 --> 19:55.304
I'm sure Sidney understands.

19:55.463 --> 20:00.854
Make sure he does. As well
as this 'friend' of his.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.046
Hm?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.880
Sorry.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
So sorry. Forgive me.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.240
I'm terribly sorry. I'm
a little out of practice.

20:19.107 --> 20:20.243
Mr Ali.

20:20.765 --> 20:22.558
I didn't think that you drank.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.489
Well, some of us have to be responsible.

20:26.244 --> 20:28.364
May I trouble you for another?

20:33.298 --> 20:36.098
It must be difficult with
no other family here.

20:36.124 --> 20:37.759
Stiff upper lip.

20:38.509 --> 20:40.800
That's what you British say, isn't it?

20:40.840 --> 20:44.000
Not always for the best.

20:44.165 --> 20:47.765
You know, at home we are taught
that everything you do is the best.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.842
Best schooling, best
manners, best bitter.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.115
That's what I told Zafar
when they made me bring him.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.688
But it's not the best.

20:59.370 --> 21:00.612
It's a lie.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.760
- You're liars.
- I know you're upset.

21:04.020 --> 21:07.940
Zafar believed it. He wanted to be
like you. I wanted to be like you.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.202
But I couldn't.

21:09.591 --> 21:12.960
I don't drink, I don't curse,
I don't play your stupid games.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.280
- You don't have to fit in.
- Yes, you do.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.430
Or you end up alone, like me.

21:17.935 --> 21:19.760
Or like my brother; dead.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.003
Mr Ali.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.880
Mr Ali! You live this way.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.240
- I can bowl too, you know?
- Munir?

21:50.240 --> 21:52.680
- Murderer!
- Hey! That's enough!

21:53.480 --> 21:56.960
- Bloody savage! - Mr Towler, please.
He's drunk. I'm taking him home.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.320
- She killed him! She killed my brother!
- That is enough!

22:12.186 --> 22:15.786
- She did it, I'm telling you.
- We don't know it was anyone for sure.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.920
You were the ones who suspected,
you came asking questions.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.840
- Munir, she loved him.
- That's the biggest lie of all.

22:22.721 --> 22:24.237
I told her the truth.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.224
What truth?

22:26.381 --> 22:28.336
How do you kill someone that you love?

22:29.034 --> 22:30.386
What did you tell her?

22:30.595 --> 22:32.508
That Zafar was engaged.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.653
At home.

22:35.607 --> 22:37.600
Our parents have chosen wives for us.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.000
And that's why she did it.
Because I told her.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.320
Because I brought him here and...
I didn't protect him.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.760
Phil, is Geordie still in?

22:58.800 --> 23:01.840
- I've got a potential lead on the poisoning.
- What sort of lead?

23:01.989 --> 23:05.309
Not the Towler girl, is it? Look,
you've just got to leave it.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.908
- According to whom?
- Who do you think?

23:08.279 --> 23:10.640
The people upstairs that
you don't work for.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.863
Look, just leave the family alone
unless you're one hundred per cent.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.118
- Does Geordie know about this?
- I don't know.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.960
He left a couple of hours ago.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.621
Around the same time as er... Margaret.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.123
He told me he was working late.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.400
Well, it's a serious case,
the poisoning.

23:38.726 --> 23:40.440
It's not the first time, recently.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.800
Sidney, you'd tell me if you knew
something, wouldn't you?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.229
Of course I would.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.865
I'll tell him you called.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.567
Come on, off to bed.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.760
On behalf of the Church of England,

24:32.800 --> 24:36.760
I must ask you to cease and desist
from your relationship with Sidney.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.189
Hm. Are you going to arrest me?

24:41.600 --> 24:45.440
You're a married woman. You
have obligations to honour.

24:45.480 --> 24:49.683
That's a bit rich coming from a religion that
was set up by someone wanting a divorce.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.027
Henry VIII had a number of
issues with papal authority.

24:53.960 --> 24:58.040
And, more pertinently, it's
not good for Sidney's job.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.690
Did Mrs Maguire send you?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.054
The Archdeacon.

25:08.209 --> 25:09.484
Does everyone know?

25:09.979 --> 25:11.609
Everyone that matters.

25:23.520 --> 25:27.680
The solicitor suggests I book
a guesthouse in Hunstanton,

25:27.720 --> 25:30.738
tip off a private detective and
pretend to commit adultery.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.355
Sounds rather fun, doesn't it?

25:35.840 --> 25:37.369
If it wasn't so bleak.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.735
But at least then no-one would
be able to blame Sidney.

25:43.720 --> 25:47.400
It must be awful, not being
able to love who you want.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.597
You know where the church
stands on divorce.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.960
But you and Sidney can
always be friends.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.516
Hey!

26:26.760 --> 26:28.121
What are you doing?

26:30.680 --> 26:31.708
I was working.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.960
- I saw you.
- Then why are you asking?

26:36.400 --> 26:38.560
- Get off.
- You're married.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.923
So's Amanda.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.393
So spare me the sermon.

26:42.419 --> 26:44.471
- We're not doing anything.
- Oh, come on.

26:44.497 --> 26:46.156
We are not doing this.

26:46.427 --> 26:48.427
'Thought, word and deed', Sidney.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.446
That's one of yours, isn't it?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.800
Don't you be bringing
your murders in here.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
You'll put Mr Finch off his stride.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.640
The thing about Dostoyevsky is...

27:11.680 --> 27:15.680
It's the conflict between the
characters and their worlds.

27:15.720 --> 27:16.950
Yes!

27:20.080 --> 27:21.022
Oh.

27:22.514 --> 27:23.982
Hello, Sidney.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.939
Please. Don't let me interrupt.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.800
You're not right, are you?

27:35.840 --> 27:38.033
This medicine isn't doing you much good.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.264
Come on.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.200
Come on.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.240
Good boy.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.800
I got a call from Geoff Towler saying
Munir broke his window yesterday.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.440
He said you were with him. That right?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.273
Come in.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.986
So, how long's it been going on?

28:17.320 --> 28:18.957
You and Margaret.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.037
Since you and me had that fight.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.775
I let you get that lucky
punch in, remember?

28:29.440 --> 28:31.049
I'm not blaming you.

28:31.538 --> 28:32.707
I was just...

28:34.480 --> 28:36.760
I was on my own, Sidney,
and she was there.

28:36.956 --> 28:39.156
- Cathy was there.
- It's not the same.

28:39.655 --> 28:41.403
I work. Cathy cooks.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.689
She loves you. You love her.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.229
You can't throw all that away
for some... stupid fling.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.320
- It's not a fling.
- Well, then what is it?

28:53.320 --> 28:55.400
Margaret's half your age for a start.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.393
I'm sorry what I said
about you and Amanda.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.840
No. No, no, you were right.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.471
It is the same thing.

29:06.552 --> 29:08.189
We went to see Guy the other day.

29:10.868 --> 29:13.068
- He cried.
- Guy cried?

29:14.080 --> 29:15.805
No wonder she's leaving him.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.160
He's lost his wife, his daughter.

29:19.956 --> 29:23.116
If that's how he feels,
imagine how Cathy would feel.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.720
I've tried to tell myself Guy
brought it upon himself,

29:27.760 --> 29:29.709
that Amanda and I are
doing nothing wrong.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.266
But it's not true.

29:34.995 --> 29:37.515
And the more I push it
away, the worse it feels.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.718
It needs to end.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.206
So, what happened with Munir?

29:55.040 --> 29:59.560
He thinks Annie poisoned Zafar because
she found out he was engaged.

30:02.497 --> 30:04.099
We got the postmortem back.

30:04.810 --> 30:06.176
They don't know what the poison is yet,

30:06.202 --> 30:09.160
but Zafar had a lot more in his
system than the rest of us.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.313
So we have to assume that he was
poisoned again, afterwards.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.915
You still trust Annie though.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.736
Don't you? She loved
Zafar, like you said.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.574
Being in love doesn't
mean no-one gets hurt...

30:28.920 --> 30:30.672
..as you and I both know.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.848
It's really important
that we speak to Annie.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.640
It's the Indian you should be
speaking to, not my daughter.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.440
- She's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?

30:46.480 --> 30:48.800
She's not in her room.
It's too early for work.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.769
- Does she have a friend she could've gone to?
- I'm her best friend.

30:51.795 --> 30:54.059
She wouldn't go somewhere
without telling me.

30:54.640 --> 30:58.216
- What if the Indian came back? He could
be ravaging her. - Enough, Rosie!

30:58.942 --> 31:00.579
We need to see Annie's room.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.691
There's no sign it's been forced.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.259
Maybe she knows we're getting
close, does a runner.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.240
It looks like Annie had an admirer.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.597
Zafar?

31:27.597 --> 31:28.974
NC.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.277
Neil Carver.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.037
I've never seen these before.

31:40.063 --> 31:42.520
You were jealous of Annie's
relationship with Zafar.

31:42.560 --> 31:47.031
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- You poisoned him to keep her for yourself. - Inspector!

31:47.419 --> 31:48.828
Annie's a child.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.653
The truth is, I've got a daughter.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.106
She's younger than Annie.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.170
When my wife left me,
she took Ruth with her.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.360
That's why I moved here.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.190
To get away from the scandal.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.240
But I like having Annie around.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.484
She reminds me of Ruth.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.896
- The handwriting's different.
- Exactly.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.840
So, what? Zafar sent the gifts?

32:28.880 --> 32:32.360
- Why would he use my initials?
- Or Annie has another admirer

32:32.400 --> 32:35.000
- who wanted Zafar dead.
- Same question applies.

32:35.278 --> 32:38.016
Or Annie made them up
to muddy the waters.

32:39.240 --> 32:43.794
Like poisoning everyone, including herself,
to make the murder look like an accident.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.957
Do you have any idea
where she'd go to hide?

32:49.274 --> 32:50.391
I do.

32:57.421 --> 32:58.821
Wait here.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.756
Annie?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.007
Annie?

33:17.782 --> 33:19.030
Sidney?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.156
Hey!

33:24.760 --> 33:26.541
Don't make me go home!

33:29.480 --> 33:33.080
When you left last night, my
dad said some horrible things.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.712
How he wished Munir was dead too.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.320
And after everything you asked
me about what Zafar drank,

33:40.548 --> 33:42.560
I was scared it was
dad who poisoned him.

33:45.087 --> 33:48.560
Did you see him put anything
in the tea you gave Zafar?

33:49.640 --> 33:50.564
No.

33:51.589 --> 33:54.309
But he was there when
I made up the flask.

33:56.520 --> 34:00.200
Your dad's strict, but you really
think he'd do something like that?

34:01.497 --> 34:03.244
Zafar's bruises.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.431
It was Dad's friends from the lodge
that beat him up.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.639
He told them to do it after
he caught us together.

34:14.213 --> 34:16.000
Why didn't you tell us this sooner?

34:16.353 --> 34:18.119
Because I thought you were one of them,

34:18.396 --> 34:19.829
in the police.

34:21.295 --> 34:24.338
I didn't think he'd actually kill him.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.947
But now...

34:28.880 --> 34:30.690
..I'm scared of what he'll do to me.

34:31.072 --> 34:33.627
Well, why would he hurt you? It's over.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.196
You're pregnant.

34:44.855 --> 34:47.054
That's why you were sick at the cricket.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.719
If Dad finds out, he'll
make me get rid of it.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.800
He has more 'friends' at the hospital.

35:03.972 --> 35:06.226
And these? Who sent them to you?

35:09.970 --> 35:13.370
They're not from me. You know
my scrawl, it's barely legible.

35:14.003 --> 35:15.088
Look.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.607
It's not the same. So who?

35:25.757 --> 35:27.877
Give him two drops of this,

35:29.360 --> 35:32.800
twice a day, plenty of
walks and no more beer.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.360
The medicine you gave to Dickens,

35:37.600 --> 35:38.804
what is it?

35:39.859 --> 35:43.720
Antimony. It's a bit old-fashioned,
but it flushes out the system.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.515
- Similar to arsenic?
- Yes.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.132
Could that have made us
all ill at the cricket?

35:50.775 --> 35:52.600
- Possibly.
- And killed Zafar?

35:53.030 --> 35:54.440
In a large enough dose.

35:54.571 --> 35:56.680
It's done nothing for Dickens.

36:02.940 --> 36:04.168
No odour.

36:08.640 --> 36:13.440
- It should be bitter. - Someone must've stolen
the medicine from your bag to poison the beer.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.312
Who can access your supply?

36:16.210 --> 36:18.210
In the surgery, only Annie and me.

36:18.804 --> 36:22.569
And the last time I took it out of my bag was
when I went to your house to treat your dog.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.296
Your father let me in.

36:24.478 --> 36:27.280
And we know Geoff wanted
to get rid of Zafar.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.925
- Drink it!
- Ugh!

36:39.457 --> 36:41.920
- Drink it!
- Get off him.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.470
I'm trying to help him!

36:44.378 --> 36:45.616
- Mr Towler?
- You...

36:48.600 --> 36:50.320
I was trying to help him.

37:05.630 --> 37:08.150
I came to apologise for
my behaviour last night.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.320
Whatever my suspicions, I
should've left it to you.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.880
I rang the bell but nobody answered.

37:15.354 --> 37:17.234
I could hear struggling inside.

37:30.105 --> 37:31.945
Drink it!

37:34.069 --> 37:35.607
Drink it!

37:39.072 --> 37:43.161
He was clutching his stomach like my brother.
I tried to make him sick with saltwater.

37:53.052 --> 37:54.864
And everything else is as you found it?

37:56.480 --> 37:57.513
Uh-huh.

37:59.221 --> 38:01.381
- What is it?
- A suicide note.

38:04.596 --> 38:07.598
It says Geoff poisoned Zafar and
he couldn't live with himself.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.591
It's the same writing that was
on the presents for Annie.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.360
So what? He was trying to
get Annie and Neil together

38:16.400 --> 38:18.880
and that's why he killed Zafar?

38:18.920 --> 38:21.429
It fits. Poisoner poisons himself.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.800
"I cannot live another
minute with what I did,

38:25.840 --> 38:30.072
"any more than I could bear Annie wasting
her life with a boy she never truly loved.

38:30.587 --> 38:35.366
True love is a man strong... and kind."

38:36.622 --> 38:38.651
_

38:40.553 --> 38:41.921
This isn't Geoff.

38:42.992 --> 38:45.715
This reads like a bad romance novel.

38:48.080 --> 38:50.280
Neil?!

38:50.990 --> 38:52.245
Annie?!

39:05.280 --> 39:08.923
Rosie Towler, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Zafar Ali

39:09.200 --> 39:11.292
and the attempted
murder of Geoff Towler.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.496
Mum?

39:16.064 --> 39:17.942
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:18.537 --> 39:21.448
<i>You sent your own daughter round
to kill the man she loved.</i>

39:21.612 --> 39:23.612
You've made a mistake. I...

39:23.963 --> 39:25.840
I need to get home to cook.

39:25.880 --> 39:30.200
You're not going home unless you can
refute the allegations made against you.

39:30.867 --> 39:32.502
We know you wrote this.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.080
Just like you sent these.

39:38.547 --> 39:40.547
No, Neil sent those to Annie.

39:40.573 --> 39:43.333
- Mrs Towler.
- Rosie, we know it's a fantasy.

39:44.960 --> 39:47.840
We all have them because
real life is hard.

39:49.056 --> 39:52.666
It's like those books you escape into,
when you're feeling unhappy at home.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.840
I've got a beautiful home, a daughter.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.999
My husband's a pillar of the community.

39:58.025 --> 40:00.814
And Neil would make a perfect addition.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.243
Yes! He's a lovely man.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.680
Dashing. And... and he's a vet.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.350
Annie loves animals.

40:07.619 --> 40:09.222
But she doesn't love him.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.379
She'll come around.

40:14.810 --> 40:16.105
Even now?

40:16.960 --> 40:18.300
With the baby?

40:20.877 --> 40:23.000
Where does that fit
in with your fantasy?

40:23.040 --> 40:25.960
It was that Indian's fault.
He tricked my Annie.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.480
Zafar loved her, she loved him.
They were going to get married.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.360
- Over my dead body.
- That's why you killed Zafar.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.953
- No! - You poisoned everyone at the
cricket to make it look like an accident.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.560
Then you gave Annie poisoned
tea to take to him.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.543
He shouldn't have been here in the
first place! He didn't fit. He...

40:43.240 --> 40:44.670
He didn't belong.

40:45.030 --> 40:47.030
Not like us, not like we do.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.083
And where do you belong Rosie?
At home, with Geoff?

40:53.424 --> 40:54.505
Yes.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.640
That why you tried to kill him too?
Because we were getting close

40:59.680 --> 41:01.640
- and you needed a scapegoat.
- No.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.880
- Or because you hate him and can't
bear another minute with him? - No!

41:04.920 --> 41:07.000
- He bullies you. He belittles you.
- Shut up!

41:07.040 --> 41:09.120
You don't want Annie
to end up like that,

41:09.160 --> 41:11.560
- married to the wrong man.
- She deserves better!

41:11.600 --> 41:15.880
So instead you had her kill the man
she loves, without her even knowing.

41:16.146 --> 41:18.706
And now she's all alone because of you.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

41:25.051 --> 41:27.753
Annie is supposed to be with Neil.

41:33.278 --> 41:34.347
I...

41:35.427 --> 41:37.018
I should be at home.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.800
This isn't where I belong, is it?

41:43.124 --> 41:44.266
Look at me.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.120
Ohh...

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
There's the world as it is...

41:58.640 --> 42:02.760
and the world as we would like it to be.

42:04.638 --> 42:07.558
Zafar Ali was that rare thing.

42:08.200 --> 42:12.440
Someone who lived the
life they wanted to live.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.480
He didn't pray as he
was supposed to pray.

42:19.960 --> 42:23.960
He loved someone... he
wasn't supposed to love.

42:26.480 --> 42:29.151
He held firm when others
told him to walk.

42:30.920 --> 42:35.080
The problem is, we don't
all want the same thing.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.881
One man's happiness...

42:39.737 --> 42:41.737
is another man's sorrow.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.755
Zafar was killed

42:53.000 --> 42:56.200
because he didn't fit into
somebody else's world.

42:58.640 --> 43:02.320
I'd like to say we should
all be more like Zafar.

43:03.270 --> 43:04.821
The truth is...

43:06.928 --> 43:08.719
..the world won't let us.

43:26.289 --> 43:27.693
Oh, hello.

43:28.018 --> 43:30.060
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I'm not coming in.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.376
I'm glad you're here. I
was going to pop over.

43:41.604 --> 43:44.044
I'm sorry I've been so... busy.

43:44.280 --> 43:48.040
- It's just been the case, Zafar's
memorial service... - I know.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.449
- Drink?
- Yes, please.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.165
- Look, there's something...
- I don't know how to say this.

44:10.880 --> 44:14.800
- Can I go first? - No, I've been rehearsing
this and I'm scared it'll go out of my head.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.160
Amanda, this is going to
be hard enough as it is.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.914
We can't do this any more.

44:21.186 --> 44:24.040
I'm still leaving him, it
just can't be for you.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.080
It's... it's too difficult.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.040
- I know.
- You know?

44:33.320 --> 44:35.920
How it looks. What it means.

44:37.560 --> 44:41.320
- It shouldn't matter, but...
- But it... does.

44:46.673 --> 44:48.287
We even agree on this.
