Sure.

17:41.526 --> 17:43.191
Jane right?

17:43.193 --> 17:46.295
Yes ma'am.

17:46.297 --> 17:47.763
You know about your friend?

17:47.765 --> 17:51.467
Yea. I know she's missing.

17:51.469 --> 17:55.138
I just wish she would have
told me before she ran away.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.338
You think she ran away?

17:56.340 --> 18:02.545
Yea. She didn't like her home.
She and her mom argued a lot.

18:02.547 --> 18:05.213
But don't a lot of
kids argue with their moms?

18:05.215 --> 18:10.555
I guess. She didn't like
talking about her mom that much.

18:13.423 --> 18:16.359
I just wish she would have
told me. I could have gone

18:16.361 --> 18:23.466
with her. We could have
gone everywhere together.

18:23.468 --> 18:25.571

No.

thinking about?

18:36.580 --> 18:40.315
I hope she's
somewhere cool. Somewhere fun.

18:40.317 --> 18:43.853
Like on a plane.
Halley loved planes.

18:43.855 --> 18:45.321
Planes?

18:45.323 --> 18:48.924
Yea, she always
wanted to ride one.

18:48.926 --> 18:54.462
We planned it. I would go with
her, we would get on a plane.

No. Have you?

19:09.247 --> 19:11.250
Yea.

19:12.683 --> 19:17.953
I went to Fort Worth once.

19:17.955 --> 19:21.489
I know it's not very awesome.
But a lot of things get pretty

19:21.491 --> 19:23.625
uncool when you grow up.

19:23.627 --> 19:25.260
That sucks.

19:25.262 --> 19:28.733
Yea.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.802
Let's say Halley
didn't run away.

19:32.804 --> 19:37.273
Maybe somebody took her who
didn't ask her mom's permission.

19:37.275 --> 19:39.976
Do you know
somebody who'd do that?

19:39.978 --> 19:46.315
No. Not if you mean
bullies. Everybody liked her.

19:46.317 --> 19:49.884
What about her mom?
What do you think of her?

19:49.886 --> 19:53.989
Ms. Dawn?
I've never really met her.

19:53.991 --> 19:57.994
My parents say she is a
little rough around the edges.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.929
How so?

19:59.931 --> 20:02.331
One time Halley had
to come over here and ask for a

20:02.333 --> 20:05.801
ride to school herself.
Later, my dad told me it was

20:05.803 --> 20:08.371
because
her mom was hungover.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.273
How long have you known her?

20:10.275 --> 20:12.908
Since the 1st grade.

20:12.910 --> 20:15.044
And she comes over here a lot?

20:15.046 --> 20:19.515
Yea. She said it was
because she gets bored but I

20:19.517 --> 20:23.419
just think she wants to get out
of the house more than anything.

20:23.421 --> 20:25.688
Did she come over
here last night?

20:25.690 --> 20:29.491
No, ma'am.

20:29.493 --> 20:31.526
How did you two meet?

20:31.528 --> 20:34.830
We had the same 1st
grade teacher.

20:34.832 --> 20:37.033
She was the
new student in class.

20:37.035 --> 20:40.803
For whatever reason
she started school late.

20:40.805 --> 20:43.905
The teacher made
us all get up and greet her.

20:43.907 --> 20:46.042
I was the last
one to say "hi".

20:46.044 --> 20:50.046
When I turned around, all
but two seats were taken.

20:50.048 --> 20:53.849
So we became table neighbors.
Then she moved down

20:53.851 --> 20:58.824
the street, we
became real life neighbors.

21:02.026 --> 21:08.029

23:53.029 --> 23:54.630
- Yes.
- Okay,

23:54.632 --> 23:57.132
And generally that means
that the mom works a lot.

23:57.134 --> 24:01.737
Um which means that she's not
as engaged in the child's life.

24:01.739 --> 24:04.672
Which then reflects on
the child's school life.

24:04.674 --> 24:06.709
How's that?

24:06.711 --> 24:09.644
Well she is probably
the quietest student I have.

24:44.147 --> 24:48.717
Well, for a student
to have the grades that Halley

24:48.719 --> 24:52.086
does, it usually means that the

01:07:58.706 --> 01:08:04.813
And I... I leave
money on the table.

01:08:09.317 --> 01:08:12.217
You're a teacher.

01:08:12.219 --> 01:08:16.221
People trust you
with their kids.

01:08:16.224 --> 01:08:18.724
You're supposed to protect them.

01:08:18.725 --> 01:08:24.131
Make sure nothing
bad ever happens to them.

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:31.603
I promise you,
everyone will know who you are

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:41.317
and everyone
will know what you did.

[LIGHT PIANO MUSIC AND RAIN
SOUND EFFECTS ENSUE]

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:19.352
I'd like to thank you all for
coming out tonight in the rain.

01:09:19.354 --> 01:09:24.323
I don't how many of you believe
in prayer, but I sure do.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:31.731
I do know that Halley would be
thankful for all you coming out.

01:09:31.733 --> 01:09:35.300
You all do so much.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:39.805
I just ask you to pray
with me one last time.

01:09:39.807 --> 01:09:48.313
Dear God, we ask you
to bring dear Halley back to us.

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:53.652
Watch over her, wherever she is.

01:09:53.654 --> 01:09:57.557
We thank you for these people,
who've shown their love to this

01:09:57.559 --> 01:10:05.764
little girl that isn't
even their own. Amen.

01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:09.001
I talked to Mr. Flynn.

01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:15.476
I will arrest you in front of
all of your new friends.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:24.317
Just get in!

01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:26.852
What's this about?

01:10:26.854 --> 01:10:29.821
How many people did you let
sleep with your daughter?

01:10:29.823 --> 01:10:31.357
What?

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:37.233
Your 12 year old daughter.

01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:44.640
Where is she? Who is she with?

01:10:46.608 --> 01:10:49.342
What did you do you
sick, twisted, awful-

01:10:49.344 --> 01:10:51.977
Do you have any
kids detective Willow?

01:10:51.979 --> 01:10:59.052
Huh? Do you? You don't know the
first thing about what it takes

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:05.791
to raise another human
being. You have no idea.

01:11:05.793 --> 01:11:10.897
Let alone by yourself.

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.598
I had Halley when I was 18,
and by the time I was

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.336
24 her daddy died.

01:11:17.338 --> 01:11:21.840
And what do I
know about raising kids.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:25.611
You try to provide for 'em,
but you can't because you

01:11:25.613 --> 01:11:30.383
don't have make enough money
or... or you're not smart enough

01:11:30.385 --> 01:11:35.053
or somewhere along the
way you didn't work hard enough.

01:11:35.055 --> 01:11:38.458
It never goes away.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:43.362
You always
got to pay your debt.

01:11:43.364 --> 01:11:48.901
I will never be
able to forget...

01:11:48.903 --> 01:11:51.838
I have done some things

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.508
that I'm not proud of,
but that does not mean I

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.943
don't love my daughter.

01:11:57.945 --> 01:12:01.580
Oh judge me all you
want detective...

01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:08.388
but you can't judge that.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:16.595
Where is your
daughter Maddie?

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:23.669
Clayton.
We talked about more money.

01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:28.941
I wanted to move to a new house.

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:34.813
And then he got the idea about
the truck stops and there's less

01:12:34.815 --> 01:12:39.552
chance of people
recognizing anybody and...

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:45.127
They only drive through
there every once in awhile.

01:12:47.162 --> 01:12:52.831
Clayton just took her.
He knew I couldn't say anything.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:54.200
And then when you guys
couldn't find her-

01:12:54.202 --> 01:12:59.738
I will find her
Maddie. I will find her.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:05.143
And I will make sure that
monsters like you do not get a

01:13:05.145 --> 01:13:07.580
happy ending.

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:10.516
I will make sure that you're
put away, to never see the light

01:13:10.518 --> 01:13:12.184
of day.

01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:16.455
You will not win.
I want you to think

01:13:16.457 --> 01:13:21.527
about that tonight,
when you sleep in jail.

01:13:21.529 --> 01:13:26.535
[MELANCHOLY DRAMATIC
PIANO MUSIC BEGINS]

01:13:35.609 --> 01:13:39.010
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

01:13:39.012 --> 01:13:43.516
It's not right.

01:13:43.518 --> 01:13:47.954
I wish I could've
seen it sooner.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:51.958
You've been through so
much and I haven't the slightest

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:58.867
idea what to say to you.

01:14:02.636 --> 01:14:05.804
I want you to know that all
people aren't like the ones

01:14:05.806 --> 01:14:09.976
you've known.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:15.551
You've lost so much.
I'm sorry Halley.

01:14:21.555 --> 01:14:23.222
I don't know what to say.

01:14:23.224 --> 01:14:26.925
Because there's no amount
of explaining that would ever

01:14:26.927 --> 01:14:32.932
make this any easier for you.

01:14:32.934 --> 01:14:40.171
I'm so angry about
everything that happened to you.

01:14:40.173 --> 01:14:42.541
It's not right.

01:14:42.543 --> 01:14:47.178
And you have every
right to be angry.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:54.286
But things will be different
from now on, I promise.

01:14:54.288 --> 01:14:57.723
There are good people
in the world, people who will

01:14:57.725 --> 01:15:04.867
protect you, and take
care of you and love you.

01:15:10.704 --> 01:15:16.110
I promise.
