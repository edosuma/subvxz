WEBVTT

00:04.471 --> 00:06.674
In the beginning,

00:06.675 --> 00:08.842
we were so naive.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.747
Our mother made us
into beasts

00:12.748 --> 00:15.683
that fed on blood,

00:15.684 --> 00:19.320
but immortality was
beyond our grasp,

00:19.321 --> 00:22.588
compulsion a trick
we had yet to learn.

00:24.157 --> 00:28.361
All we knew was a fear
of being hunted.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.835
That and a terrible hunger.

00:38.504 --> 00:40.439
So we ran...

00:40.440 --> 00:43.342
As a family...

00:43.343 --> 00:45.243
And when we needed to...

00:46.445 --> 00:48.045
As a family...

00:49.012 --> 00:50.616
We fed.

00:50.617 --> 00:51.851
Unh!

00:56.388 --> 00:58.189
Kol, are you quite done?

00:58.190 --> 00:59.591
Ahh.

00:59.592 --> 01:02.193
Oh, bother, Elijah.
Is all this truly necessary?

01:02.194 --> 01:04.729
Brother, the road is
a major thoroughfare.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.898
If the bodies are found,
word of our presence

01:06.899 --> 01:08.198
will spread to Mikael.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.900
We have run through
autumn and winter,

01:09.902 --> 01:12.002
through sleet and snow.

01:12.004 --> 01:14.069
Are we cursed to forever
live in fear of our father?

01:14.071 --> 01:15.873
I should say yes sadly.

01:15.874 --> 01:17.674
Finn, please.
Niklaus.

01:17.675 --> 01:20.544
Do we have any idea where
we're running to next?

01:20.545 --> 01:22.913
Why not just do what we've
all thought of doing?

01:22.914 --> 01:25.115
Split up.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.417
We swore a vow.

01:26.418 --> 01:28.886
Your vows haunt me
more than father himself.

01:28.887 --> 01:30.420
At least he can't chase us all.

01:30.421 --> 01:32.587
I say we take our chances.

01:34.457 --> 01:35.857
Perhaps Kol is right.

01:35.859 --> 01:37.893
Thank you, Finn.
Yeah, I've always said

01:37.895 --> 01:39.662
eldest is the most intelligent.

01:39.663 --> 01:40.963
Stop talking!

01:40.964 --> 01:42.432
I take no Joy in our assent,

01:42.433 --> 01:44.867
but I do wish to sleep in a bed,

01:44.868 --> 01:46.935
to bathe in a bath,
to feed of proper food.

01:46.936 --> 01:48.503
If we divide...

01:48.504 --> 01:49.738
No, brother.

01:49.739 --> 01:52.172
Niklaus is right.
We made a vow.

01:54.242 --> 01:55.843
Family above all.

01:58.914 --> 02:00.749
Always...

02:00.750 --> 02:02.283
Forever.

Freya, voice-over:
"My dear Rebekah...

02:32.946 --> 02:36.182
"I hope this finds you well.

02:36.183 --> 02:38.617
"I write to offer an update

02:38.618 --> 02:41.285
"and to ask your advice.

02:41.287 --> 02:44.222
"Our brothers remain at odds.

02:44.223 --> 02:46.291
"Klaus will never apologize,

02:46.292 --> 02:48.193
"not for the blood he shed,

02:48.194 --> 02:51.028
nor the suffering
Hayley continues to endure"...

02:53.198 --> 02:55.398
"And Elijah cannot forgive him."

02:56.901 --> 02:58.402
"Despite my efforts,

02:58.403 --> 03:00.871
we are a house divided"...

03:02.353 --> 03:06.176
"Which is not to say
I have no good news.

03:06.177 --> 03:08.245
"Niklaus kept his word.

03:08.246 --> 03:09.947
"Marcel controls the quarter.

03:09.948 --> 03:11.482
"There he has founded
a fight gym

03:11.483 --> 03:13.116
"in the old St. Anne's church,

03:13.117 --> 03:15.184
"where he tests the mettle
of those who wish to join

03:15.185 --> 03:17.554
"his vampire community.

03:17.555 --> 03:21.057
"Elijah has begun joining
him for sparring.

03:21.058 --> 03:23.592
I believe it helps him
work through his anger"...

03:25.328 --> 03:28.330
"And he has much anger."

03:29.866 --> 03:32.034
"While hope
continues to flourish,

03:32.035 --> 03:35.303
"it is clear
that she misses her mother.

03:35.304 --> 03:38.340
"Though Niklaus remains
the doting father,

03:38.341 --> 03:40.208
"he has been of no help
in finding a cure

03:40.209 --> 03:41.776
for Hayley's curse."

03:43.345 --> 03:44.747
"Despite my best efforts,

03:44.748 --> 03:46.414
"I have yet to find a means
to undo the spell

03:46.415 --> 03:49.350
"placed on her
and the crescent wolves,

03:49.351 --> 03:52.153
"and Hayley herself
continues to struggle,

03:52.154 --> 03:55.056
"unable to see her child
except once a month

03:55.057 --> 03:56.757
on a full moon"...

03:58.325 --> 04:01.528
"And we're in no position
to ask for outside help."

04:01.530 --> 04:02.996
Can you just hear me out?

04:02.997 --> 04:05.098
No. Witches don't do
favors for vampires,

04:05.099 --> 04:06.366
including daylight rings.

04:06.367 --> 04:08.035
Those are the rules.

04:08.036 --> 04:10.803
An act of good faith will
help keep the peace.

04:10.805 --> 04:13.639
The ninth ward coven thinks
I'm a vampire sympathizer.

04:13.641 --> 04:16.409
I won't prove them right.

04:16.410 --> 04:17.778
You're on your own.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.379
"Davina's rage
at our family

04:19.380 --> 04:20.446
"has only grown,

04:20.447 --> 04:22.548
"and as regent of all covens,

04:22.549 --> 04:25.717
"she's far too formidable
to be swayed.

04:25.719 --> 04:28.420
"Meanwhile, Niklaus
has begun to see Camille

04:28.421 --> 04:31.356
"for what he calls
their little chats.

04:31.357 --> 04:34.393
"He claims a desire
to ammend his ways.

04:34.394 --> 04:37.428
In truth, he seems
utterly free of remorse"...

04:37.429 --> 04:38.597
...around in his blood,

04:38.598 --> 04:39.798
and that was the end of that.

04:39.799 --> 04:42.801
"Which only drives
Elijah further away.

04:42.802 --> 04:45.269
"I wonder if you would
write me with any advice

04:45.270 --> 04:48.206
"you have on how to heal
their fractured bond.

04:48.207 --> 04:54.243
Until then, I remain
your loving sister Freya."

05:21.838 --> 05:23.371
Camille.

05:23.373 --> 05:24.741
Thanks for coming.

05:24.742 --> 05:27.576
Why did you ask me
to meet you here?

05:27.577 --> 05:30.278
Well, I had hoped we might
have one of our little chats,

05:30.279 --> 05:34.149
and I thought you might
appreciate the change of venue,

05:34.150 --> 05:37.519
so I'm allowing you
a private tour

05:37.520 --> 05:40.455
of my exhibition.

05:40.456 --> 05:42.524
These are yours?

05:42.525 --> 05:43.825
Heh.

05:43.826 --> 05:45.425
I spent the better part
of a millennia

05:45.426 --> 05:47.895
trying not to draw
my father's attention,

05:47.896 --> 05:49.530
and now he's dead,

05:49.531 --> 05:50.865
and all those
who stood against me

05:50.866 --> 05:53.034
have been vanquished.

05:53.035 --> 05:54.635
I see no reason
the fruits of my labor

05:54.636 --> 05:56.736
should go unappreciated.

05:59.206 --> 06:02.441
I didn't come here
to appreciate art.

06:02.442 --> 06:04.010
If you want to talk
about your progress

06:04.011 --> 06:06.079
as a person striving
for empathy, fine.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.082
If not, I'll go.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.850
Have I offended you?

06:10.851 --> 06:13.552
I agreed to see you
professionally,

06:13.554 --> 06:17.323
but I was very clear
when I set our boundaries,

06:17.324 --> 06:19.958
and they don't include
private art shows.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.927
Oh. Well, then
perhaps you'd prefer

06:21.928 --> 06:24.228
to escort me
to tomorrow's opening.

06:26.531 --> 06:28.866
Call me if you want to talk.

06:33.005 --> 06:34.371
Wait.

06:36.507 --> 06:39.410
You're worried
no one else will come.

06:39.411 --> 06:41.579
Rebekah's gone, Marcel's angry,

06:41.580 --> 06:42.747
Elijah won't even look at you.

06:42.748 --> 06:44.014
You'll be alone.

06:46.184 --> 06:50.554
You're scared because the people
you love are angry with you.

06:50.555 --> 06:52.755
Maybe you need to think
about that.

06:59.395 --> 07:00.999
I have to go.

07:09.739 --> 07:10.940
Ok. The thing
you got to understand

07:10.941 --> 07:12.742
is me and Nola pd got
a relationship

07:12.743 --> 07:15.711
that goes back to
that nastiness with my ex-wife.

07:15.712 --> 07:17.713
I'm their expert in
anything that seems occult,

07:17.714 --> 07:19.481
and every so often,
they come across the aftermath

07:19.482 --> 07:22.186
of some black magic,
and they call me in.

07:25.054 --> 07:27.388
This your friend the shrink?

07:27.389 --> 07:29.924
Fantastic. Will Kinney,
detective, homicide.

07:29.925 --> 07:31.793
Cami O'Connell, bartender,

07:31.794 --> 07:33.294
part-time shrink.

07:33.295 --> 07:35.263
Why am I here?

07:35.264 --> 07:37.832
Vince, show her the body.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.000
We'll see if she can do
what you said she can do.

07:43.437 --> 07:45.973
So the cops want
a psychological profile,

07:45.974 --> 07:48.742
and given what we've found,

07:48.743 --> 07:51.443
I'd say this is
your area of expertise.

08:11.130 --> 08:13.966
She's getting bigger
by the second.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.734
Thank you for all of your care.

08:15.735 --> 08:17.435
Tomorrow's the full moon.

08:17.437 --> 08:19.604
I can help you bring hope
to Hayley if you'd like.

08:19.605 --> 08:21.306
Won't be necessary.

08:21.307 --> 08:22.974
You deserve a night off.

08:22.975 --> 08:25.576
I'd offer to accompany
you myself,

08:25.577 --> 08:28.113
but I fear my fragile ego
could not endure

08:28.114 --> 08:30.682
the litany of insults
Hayley has no doubt prepared.

08:30.683 --> 08:32.150
Yes, I doubt that your presence

08:32.150 --> 08:33.583
is particularly welcome
anywhere.

08:33.585 --> 08:35.652
My own brother greeting
me with such disdain.

08:35.653 --> 08:37.453
What do you think, Freya?

08:37.455 --> 08:40.057
Is he still angry for
my part in Hayley's curse?

08:40.058 --> 08:43.460
Need I remind him it was
my ploy that kept her alive.

08:43.461 --> 08:44.828
But of course.
Forgive me.

08:44.830 --> 08:46.197
So you would call this
an act of heroism,

08:46.198 --> 08:49.165
even as you bask in her torment?

08:50.367 --> 08:51.802
Perhaps I'd be more sympathetic

08:51.803 --> 08:53.269
if Hayley apologized.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.371
After all, it was
her that tried to run off

08:55.372 --> 08:56.806
with my daughter.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.641
Oh, if you two
must poke at one another,

08:58.642 --> 09:01.009
may I suggest doing it
elsewhere?

09:08.718 --> 09:10.618
Nicely done.

09:10.619 --> 09:13.420
At this rate, you'll drive
the entire family away.

09:27.168 --> 09:28.501
Who's ready for the next course?

09:28.503 --> 09:30.570
You're all
filthy gluttons.

09:30.572 --> 09:32.373
And you remain ever the dullard.

09:32.374 --> 09:35.476
Oh, such pretty clothes.

09:35.477 --> 09:37.044
What a shame
they'll go to waste.

09:37.045 --> 09:39.280
Rebekah, we have discussed
this endlessly.

09:39.281 --> 09:40.714
No. You've discussed this.

09:40.715 --> 09:42.316
None of us had
any say in the matter.

09:42.317 --> 09:43.683
This lot were traveling
somewhere.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.751
Their car is full
of silks and finery.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.189
5 of them, 5 of us.

09:49.190 --> 09:50.523
Wherever they were off to,

09:50.524 --> 09:52.092
why can we not simply
go in their stead.

09:52.093 --> 09:54.060
Masquerade as nobles
from a land we do not know,

09:54.061 --> 09:55.528
whose customs we cannot
begin to understand.

09:55.529 --> 09:56.662
Ridiculous.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.031
You saw the castle
down the road.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.698
It was practically a gala.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.134
If this bunch were
headed there, then...

10:02.135 --> 10:05.337
Look at them. They're not
any better than we are.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.374
We could live as they do,
at least for a time.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.210
Think of it. Elijah,
we could hide in plain sight.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.577
We could live ordinary lives.

10:12.578 --> 10:14.046
Silence.

10:29.928 --> 10:31.461
Well, aren't you a handsome one?

10:31.463 --> 10:33.064
He looks like
dessert to me.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.231
No! Wait, wait, wait!

10:34.232 --> 10:36.366
I can help you.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.935
Now I am... I am
the personal servant

10:37.936 --> 10:39.937
to the Count de Martel

10:39.938 --> 10:41.371
of the very estate
you just mentioned.

10:41.372 --> 10:43.139
I wa... I was sent
to escort these guests

10:43.141 --> 10:45.742
to his home for a lengthy stay.

10:45.743 --> 10:48.946
I know their customs, as...
as well as the count's habits.

10:48.947 --> 10:51.647
If you mean to pose as the family
you have slaughtered here,

10:51.648 --> 10:52.815
then you'll need my help

10:52.816 --> 10:54.950
to carry out your ruse.

10:58.955 --> 11:00.456
Please can we keep him?

11:00.457 --> 11:01.590
Rebekah, no.

11:01.591 --> 11:04.260
What is our most important rule?

11:04.261 --> 11:06.128
Never leave alive someone who...

11:06.129 --> 11:07.330
Has seen what we are.

11:07.331 --> 11:08.763
Thank you very much.

11:08.764 --> 11:10.365
A practice that has served
us very well indeed.

11:10.366 --> 11:11.766
She has a point.

11:11.767 --> 11:14.802
- He may be of use.
- Ah, a proper family squabble.

11:14.803 --> 11:17.572
Perhaps we should
put it to a vote.

11:17.573 --> 11:19.773
All those in favor
of letting him live.

11:23.604 --> 11:25.596
Those inclined to gut him.

11:28.449 --> 11:30.116
Well, Nik...

11:32.486 --> 11:33.987
What shall it be?

11:40.660 --> 11:43.429
It's a no-brainer really.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.164
This penthouse is equipped
with all the luxuries

11:45.165 --> 11:46.632
money can buy,

11:46.633 --> 11:50.203
and while the asking price
may seem daunting,

11:50.204 --> 11:51.670
rest assured
that your view of New Orleans

11:51.671 --> 11:53.738
will be second to none.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.544
- I do like it.
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.545 --> 12:02.280
And as for the price,

12:02.281 --> 12:04.782
well, nothing of worth comes

12:04.783 --> 12:07.652
without sacrifice,
wouldn't you agree?

12:07.653 --> 12:08.686
Mr. Castle.

12:08.687 --> 12:12.324
Please.
Call me Lucien.

12:20.897 --> 12:23.065
I'm no forensic psychologist,

12:23.067 --> 12:25.302
but whoever did this
took their time.

12:25.303 --> 12:27.837
He bled a lot,

12:27.838 --> 12:29.638
which means he was alive,

12:29.639 --> 12:32.874
but it's like
he just stood here.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.210
These ropes are
just for display.

12:35.211 --> 12:36.946
He wasn't bound, there are
no marks on his wrists,

12:36.947 --> 12:39.248
no signs of struggling
or clawing.

12:39.249 --> 12:41.984
He was compelled, Camille.

12:41.985 --> 12:45.954
Maybe rich boy pissed off
the wrong vampire.

12:45.955 --> 12:47.588
How are you guys
doing over here?

12:47.589 --> 12:50.491
Tell me you got something.

12:50.492 --> 12:53.127
It seems methodical, precise.

12:53.128 --> 12:55.729
The wounds may have a special
meaning for the killer.

12:55.730 --> 12:58.465
Not a formal ritual
but intentional...

12:59.800 --> 13:02.802
And the things we do on purpose

13:02.803 --> 13:04.437
we tend to repeat.

13:08.876 --> 13:11.111
Thank you for coming.

13:11.112 --> 13:14.247
I spent the night consulting
our ancestors.

13:14.248 --> 13:16.916
They say we must remain strong
and to defend our homes,

13:16.917 --> 13:21.354
but for now, no covens are
to expand into gentilly.

13:21.355 --> 13:24.190
This decision is to keep us
from a violent turf war

13:24.191 --> 13:25.992
with the vampires,

13:25.993 --> 13:27.692
and it's final.

13:29.962 --> 13:33.565
Excuse me, Kara.
I did not dismiss you.

13:33.566 --> 13:34.800
Do not walk away from me.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.467
Gnarly stuff.

14:11.468 --> 14:13.802
Yeah.
The guy was torn apart.

14:13.803 --> 14:15.204
I mean, there are no
obvious puncture wounds,

14:15.205 --> 14:17.140
but whoever did
that had to be a vampire.

14:17.141 --> 14:18.807
And no one heard any screams,

14:18.808 --> 14:20.276
so he must have been compelled
to just stand there

14:20.277 --> 14:22.378
and suffer.

14:22.379 --> 14:23.912
You think this was us.

14:25.148 --> 14:26.649
My guys know better
than to leave

14:26.650 --> 14:28.016
a body in the streets.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.217
Yeah? Well, how well
do you know your guys?

14:29.218 --> 14:31.253
Dead bodies lead to headlines,

14:31.254 --> 14:33.821
which means tourism drops.

14:33.822 --> 14:35.222
We don't like to mess
with the food supply.

14:35.224 --> 14:37.991
Marcel, maybe someone new
lost control.

14:37.993 --> 14:40.262
Maybe you should consider
that my guys aren't

14:40.263 --> 14:42.531
the only vampires in town.

14:42.532 --> 14:44.198
You don't think this was Klaus?

14:44.199 --> 14:46.867
Elijah says that Klaus has
been on his best behavior.

14:46.868 --> 14:48.902
I've known the guy
over 200 years.

14:48.903 --> 14:52.239
Best behavior ain't
exactly his thing.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.408
Sooner or later,
he'll cut loose,

14:54.409 --> 14:58.445
or maybe, he already did.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.501
all other nobles as "milord,"

18:03.503 --> 18:04.837
and when you speak to the count,

18:04.838 --> 18:06.437
you should speak of hunting.

18:06.439 --> 18:09.008
He loves his hawks
and his hounds,

18:09.009 --> 18:11.911
and, um, bow deep,
milady Rebekah.

Indisposed, your grace.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.079
Gout.

May I present his children?

18:53.383 --> 18:59.922
The lords Finn, Niklaus,
Elijah, and Kol.

18:59.923 --> 19:03.225
Also the lovely lady Rebekah.

19:03.226 --> 19:06.927
Your father never mentioned you
to me in all our dealings.

19:10.565 --> 19:14.302
Yes. Your grace, do forgive us.

19:14.303 --> 19:16.805
Uh, father was forever distant

19:16.806 --> 19:19.007
with his travels,
and, uh, we were

19:19.008 --> 19:22.143
largely raised by servants.

19:22.144 --> 19:23.978
However, I do know
that father would consider it

19:23.979 --> 19:25.312
a glorious honor
that we should be

19:25.313 --> 19:27.948
introduced to society
by your noble hand,

19:27.949 --> 19:30.150
your grace.

May I present our sister?

Rebekah Du Guise
de Rochefort en Seine.

19:49.736 --> 19:51.336

20:04.783 --> 20:07.653
You have proven to be
an immense help.

20:07.654 --> 20:11.189
Heh. Of course, milord.

20:11.190 --> 20:13.725
Though I must say you don't
seem at all disturbed

20:13.726 --> 20:18.162
about leading us
into your master's home.

20:18.163 --> 20:21.032
My master is a cruel drunkard

20:21.033 --> 20:23.901
who torments his
minions for sport,

20:23.902 --> 20:26.403
beggars who seek succor,

20:26.404 --> 20:28.605
vassals who cannot pay a debt,

20:28.606 --> 20:29.874
like my own father.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.675
Ah.

20:31.676 --> 20:34.377
A these gentlefolk behind
their silks and their jewels,

20:34.378 --> 20:37.546
they are slavers, killers.

20:37.548 --> 20:40.583
Whatever evil you are,

20:40.584 --> 20:43.320
you walk amongst
greater evil still.

20:45.415 --> 20:48.091
What do I care if you
kill the lot of them?

20:57.199 --> 20:59.168
Who are they?

20:59.169 --> 21:02.337
Oh. They're
the count's children,

21:02.338 --> 21:04.039
the lord Tristan and his sister

21:04.040 --> 21:07.141
the lady Aurora.

21:07.142 --> 21:11.713
She is exquisite.

21:11.714 --> 21:15.482
Yes. Um, as her
brother is wicked.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.920
Might I suggest that you
avoid them completely?

21:18.921 --> 21:21.789
Would she really be
such a threat,

21:21.790 --> 21:23.924
even to one like me?

21:23.925 --> 21:27.360
The lady Aurora doesn't need
teeth to tear a man's soul out.

21:27.361 --> 21:30.731
One need only stare in
her eyes and be lost.

21:30.732 --> 21:32.632
Ah.

21:32.633 --> 21:36.136
Oh, Kol... Kol was
a bloody loon.

21:36.137 --> 21:37.437
Loved it.

21:37.438 --> 21:39.206
And Finn... oh, Finn.
Finn... Finn was fine

21:39.207 --> 21:41.640
as long as you didn't actually
have to speak to him.

21:41.641 --> 21:44.810
Have you spoken to her?

21:44.811 --> 21:46.077
Who?

21:47.947 --> 21:51.250
Oh, you mean her.

21:51.251 --> 21:52.752
As you well know, Aurora and I

21:52.753 --> 21:55.854
parted ways centuries ago.

22:01.408 --> 22:04.262
Please excuse me. There's
someone I need to speak to.

22:04.263 --> 22:06.931
Hmm. Anyone tasty?

22:06.932 --> 22:10.368
Stay here and behave yourself.

22:10.369 --> 22:11.903
Always.

22:11.904 --> 22:14.004
Well, I suppose later
is better than never,

22:14.005 --> 22:15.739

22:24.548 --> 22:26.016
Old friend?

22:26.017 --> 22:27.951
Old acquaintance, nothing more.

22:27.952 --> 22:31.020
Old acquaintance?
You wound me?

22:31.021 --> 22:32.655
He can hear us?
Is he...

22:32.656 --> 22:34.590
Hard of hearing? Quite
the opposite actually.

22:34.591 --> 22:36.592

23:35.649 --> 23:38.717
How ominous.
What errand?

23:38.719 --> 23:41.419
A necessary evil.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.422
I would rather our niece

23:44.423 --> 23:46.591
Fair enough.
Give me a minute.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.959

Your pretty friend seems

24:00.438 --> 24:01.838
Why don't we go out,

24:12.283 --> 24:15.085
News has spread, old friend.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.854
Every vampire in the world
knows you've been attacked,

24:17.855 --> 24:20.190
a number of times nearly killed.

24:20.191 --> 24:21.591
Oh. Well, I can assure you

24:21.592 --> 24:22.792
that all those
who stood against me

24:22.793 --> 24:25.395
ended up either
desiccated, dust,

24:25.396 --> 24:27.597

Yes, but what if it
had gone the other way, hmm?

we all learned the truth...

The life of every vampire is
linked back to the original

24:38.174 --> 24:39.541
who begat the line.

24:39.542 --> 24:41.043
Kol's death confirmed it.

24:41.044 --> 24:44.947
Two entire lines
of vampires wiped out.

24:44.948 --> 24:46.815
As you can imagine, the treat
of it doesn't sit well

24:46.816 --> 24:48.715

as a result of my demise

24:51.420 --> 24:53.221
should come see me.

24:53.222 --> 24:55.656
I'll be happy to reassure them.

24:55.657 --> 24:56.958
Of course. Heh.

24:56.959 --> 25:00.995
You and your siblings
are mighty indeed,

25:00.996 --> 25:02.330
yet the attacks on you
do show that you

25:02.331 --> 25:04.866
are not completely invulnerable.

25:04.867 --> 25:07.369
While you've wallowed
in your family affairs,

25:07.370 --> 25:12.241
your progeny have grown
somewhat restless.

25:12.242 --> 25:15.444
The world is a finite
place, territory limited,

25:15.445 --> 25:17.012
and even ancient
vampires are not

25:17.013 --> 25:19.181
above vicious turf wars.

25:19.182 --> 25:21.216
What if I told you there's
a growing conflict

25:21.217 --> 25:23.451
between the remaining
3 sire lines?

25:23.452 --> 25:26.087
Suppose one of them wanted
to annihilate the other

25:26.088 --> 25:31.325
by killing Elijah, Rebekah, you?

25:31.326 --> 25:34.395
So you came all this way
to deliver a warning?

25:34.396 --> 25:36.831
Think about it.
Kill an original,

25:36.832 --> 25:39.767
wipe out an entire line
of competition.

25:39.768 --> 25:42.069
A tempting goal, made more so

25:42.070 --> 25:43.670
by the fact
that your family is divided

25:43.671 --> 25:45.806
and thus weaker
than you have ever been.

25:45.807 --> 25:48.675
My family is hardly weak.

25:48.676 --> 25:50.443
In fact, we are unkillable.

25:50.444 --> 25:52.612
The last of the white oak
is gone.

25:52.613 --> 25:56.983
Are you so certain
it's all gone,

25:56.984 --> 25:59.318
every last splinter of it

25:59.319 --> 26:01.120
banished for good?

26:02.923 --> 26:07.193
Lucien, if you had
even the slightest inkling

26:07.194 --> 26:09.528
any fragment
of white oak still existed,

26:09.529 --> 26:14.766
of course you would tell me.

26:14.767 --> 26:18.670
Easy, Nik.
You are my sire.

26:18.671 --> 26:21.705
My fate is linked to yours.

26:23.275 --> 26:25.010
If you want to know what I do

26:25.011 --> 26:27.312
about the dangers you now face,

26:27.313 --> 26:30.546
trust me enough to come with me.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.183
There is something
that you must see.

26:58.501 --> 27:00.235
I'd ask if everything was ok,

27:00.237 --> 27:03.238
but you wouldn't be here
if it were.

27:06.810 --> 27:09.845
You know, I was bored out of
my mind when I lived up here.

27:09.846 --> 27:15.651
I don't miss it,
but things were a lot simpler.

27:15.652 --> 27:19.521
And at least I felt safe.

27:19.522 --> 27:21.223
What happened?

27:21.224 --> 27:23.059
I was attacked.

27:23.060 --> 27:26.695
One of my own people tried to
use a spell to ruin my hands.

27:26.696 --> 27:29.230
What's next, my eyes, my heart?

27:29.231 --> 27:30.764
They hate me.
I knew that,

27:30.766 --> 27:32.300
but I didn't think
they would just revolt.

27:32.301 --> 27:34.002
Witches in New Orleans
have a habit

27:34.003 --> 27:35.503
of getting homicidal, all right?

27:35.504 --> 27:36.871
Why do you think I was
so hard on them?

27:36.872 --> 27:38.272
But I'm regent.
They should respect me.

27:38.273 --> 27:39.774
I didn't sign up for this.

27:39.775 --> 27:42.043
Sure you did.
You chose to be their leader.

27:42.044 --> 27:44.878
The target on your back,
it comes with the job.

27:44.879 --> 27:46.279
So what do I do?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.115
Say the word, all right?
Me and my guys will...

27:48.116 --> 27:49.683
You'll what?

27:49.684 --> 27:51.218
They see me siding with
you against my own kind,

27:51.219 --> 27:53.020
I'll just be proving them right.

27:53.021 --> 27:55.856
"D," someone came at you.

27:55.857 --> 27:57.691
It might be one today,
but if you sit back

27:57.692 --> 27:59.860
and do nothing, but tomorrow,
there'll be more.

27:59.861 --> 28:02.795
You got to respond
with a show of force.

28:02.796 --> 28:05.664
If not me, find another way,

28:05.665 --> 28:08.900
but it's got to be done.

28:23.514 --> 28:25.316
Hello, sweetie.

28:25.317 --> 28:28.120
We'll have to excuse
your auntie Freya.

28:28.121 --> 28:31.021
I've had a few
big girl drinks tonight.

28:52.508 --> 28:54.644
What the hell are you doing?

28:56.946 --> 28:58.480
Oh, my goodness.

28:58.482 --> 29:01.317
Where are my manners?

29:01.318 --> 29:03.619
Permit me to explain.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.187
Ohh! Unh!

29:07.657 --> 29:08.990
Unh!

29:15.364 --> 29:18.500
Lesson one of the hunt...

29:21.971 --> 29:23.971
Lay the bait.

29:34.849 --> 29:36.686
How precious.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.821
And just in time for lesson two.

29:50.663 --> 29:53.733
Please excuse the mess.
I've been entertaining.

29:59.072 --> 30:02.141
Well, you never were
one for subtlety.

30:02.142 --> 30:03.541
Heh.

30:34.499 --> 30:38.075
You brought me here
to have a seance?

30:38.076 --> 30:40.677
Something like that.

30:40.678 --> 30:43.380
I present
my personal forecaster...

30:43.381 --> 30:46.016
The lovely Alexis.

30:46.017 --> 30:47.550
Don't tell me you're
here to scry

30:47.551 --> 30:50.254
some future portents of my doom.

30:50.255 --> 30:52.621
Alexis is no back alley
palm reader.

30:52.622 --> 30:56.892
She's an expert cipher
of patterns, trends, cycles.

30:56.894 --> 31:00.196
She's extraordinary
on the stock market

31:00.197 --> 31:03.731
and never fails to guess the
winner of "the bachelorette."

31:06.494 --> 31:08.904
A touch forward, isn't she?

31:08.905 --> 31:10.071
I've heard so much about you,

31:10.072 --> 31:11.706
the famous hybrid.

31:11.707 --> 31:13.473
Your ancient heart beats
strong indeed

31:13.475 --> 31:16.444
for someone in such danger.

31:16.445 --> 31:18.746
If you have a warning
to deliver, luv,

31:18.747 --> 31:20.580
best get on with it.

31:21.950 --> 31:23.785
By all means,

31:23.786 --> 31:25.652
but if you want the most
from the experience,

31:25.653 --> 31:27.454
I suggest you feed on me.

31:27.455 --> 31:31.392
As you do, I'll allow
you into my mind.

31:31.393 --> 31:34.295
You can see for yourself.

31:34.296 --> 31:36.397
Come on.
How long has it been

31:36.398 --> 31:38.298
since we shared a real drink?

31:46.072 --> 31:48.507
Drink deep, but beware.

31:48.508 --> 31:52.111
What you broke is past repair.

31:52.112 --> 31:53.813
All your oaths you betray.

31:53.814 --> 31:56.082
Your sacred vows you sever,

31:56.083 --> 31:58.384
and now you see
that nothing lasts

31:58.385 --> 32:02.020
for always and forever.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.489
3 yet remain, 2 already crossed,

32:04.490 --> 32:07.960
yet in one year's time,
you'll all be lost.

32:07.961 --> 32:10.595
As your family is undone,

32:10.596 --> 32:14.366
you will see the beast
that is to come.

32:14.367 --> 32:17.033
Ohh! Do you think
you can fool me

32:17.035 --> 32:19.170
with bad poetry
and parlor tricks?

32:19.171 --> 32:21.505
My visions conjure from you.

32:21.506 --> 32:22.773
The threat you face
will be more clear

32:22.774 --> 32:24.308
the longer I'm in your presence.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.053
Kill me, you'll never
see what's coming.

32:51.027 --> 32:52.895
You will provide me with
the precise location

32:52.897 --> 32:55.365
of every last one
of those vulgar traps,

32:55.366 --> 32:59.134
as well as the routes used
by any of your other men.

32:59.135 --> 33:00.902
I... I don't know.

33:00.904 --> 33:02.304
Unh!

33:07.031 --> 33:08.443
Hayley.

33:14.316 --> 33:15.717
Forgive me.
I... I thought...

33:15.718 --> 33:17.584
I know who you thought I was.

33:20.922 --> 33:22.757
Do you know where she is?

33:22.758 --> 33:24.892
Judging by what
these hunters did,

33:24.893 --> 33:27.061
the traps they set
and the blood I saw,

33:27.062 --> 33:28.296
if she's not with her daughter,

33:28.297 --> 33:30.030
she's probably dead.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.437
You seem pretty convinced
Klaus had nothing to do with it.

33:36.438 --> 33:38.972
Now that only leaves...
Thank you...

33:38.973 --> 33:41.107
A couple hundred
vampires in the quarter.

33:41.108 --> 33:42.509
That's the thing.

33:42.510 --> 33:44.945
Even if we figure out
who killed this guy,

33:44.946 --> 33:46.046
then what?

33:46.047 --> 33:47.414
It's a vampire.

33:47.415 --> 33:49.148
What are the police gonna do?

33:49.149 --> 33:51.083
We'd be sending the arresting
officers to get slaughtered,

33:51.084 --> 33:54.454
and if we warned them, we'd get
locked up for being insane.

33:54.455 --> 33:55.688
Yeah.
That's New Orleans.

33:55.689 --> 33:59.459
Our city, our streets,
not our fault,

33:59.460 --> 34:01.327
but it is our problem.

34:06.065 --> 34:07.165
Hello?

34:07.166 --> 34:08.800
Hey. It's Kinney.

34:08.801 --> 34:10.168
Wanted to let you know
you were right.

34:10.168 --> 34:12.670
It happened again.

34:12.672 --> 34:17.141
So if you're not busy,

34:17.141 --> 34:19.710
I could use your brain.

34:19.712 --> 34:22.179
Yeah. Of course.

34:27.485 --> 34:29.754
I told you.

34:29.755 --> 34:32.757
Something is coming.

34:32.757 --> 34:35.058
You'll need me.

34:35.059 --> 34:36.893
Aah!

34:36.895 --> 34:38.428
I am Klaus Mikaelson!

34:38.429 --> 34:40.362
I don't need anyone,

34:40.364 --> 34:43.966
nor will I be warned
by lesser men!

34:43.967 --> 34:48.204
I am the thing
that lesser men fear.

34:48.205 --> 34:51.408
Then act like it...
Ha ha...

34:51.409 --> 34:53.743
Instead of doting

34:53.744 --> 34:56.045
on your pretty human girls

34:56.045 --> 34:57.846
and pouting about
your family's disapproval.

34:57.847 --> 35:01.016
Yes, you are Klaus Mikaelson!

35:01.017 --> 35:05.253
You are the most ruthless,
wicked beast to ever live.

35:05.254 --> 35:08.590
I came here to remind
you of that

35:08.591 --> 35:12.528
because, quite frankly,

35:12.529 --> 35:15.095
I've been worried
that you've lost a step.

35:15.096 --> 35:18.265
I need no reminding of who I am.

35:18.266 --> 35:21.903
That truth has been clear
to me for a thousand years.

35:21.904 --> 35:26.607
And in those years, you've
acquired countless enemies,

35:26.608 --> 35:28.776
and with the sire lines at war,

35:28.777 --> 35:30.744
you now have mine, as well.

35:30.745 --> 35:36.215
Anyone who would kill me
could now come after you,

35:36.216 --> 35:37.818
and since I have

35:37.819 --> 35:40.086
so many rivals

35:40.087 --> 35:43.356
and because I do not
want to die,

35:43.357 --> 35:46.492
I beg you let me help you.

35:46.494 --> 35:49.961
From now on,
I am the only one you can trust.

35:56.569 --> 35:58.670
I don't trust anyone.

36:43.884 --> 36:46.553
Unh!

36:46.554 --> 36:48.621
I thought you said
no vamp speed, Marcel.

36:48.622 --> 36:50.188
Come on, Vincent.

36:50.190 --> 36:52.991
If I move any slower,
I'll be going in reverse.

36:54.425 --> 36:56.930
Ooh. Fighting angry.

36:56.931 --> 36:58.932
Because they found
that second dead body?

36:58.933 --> 37:02.266
You still think
it's my guys. Huh?

37:07.405 --> 37:10.175
Don't matter what
I think, Marcel.

37:10.176 --> 37:12.544
News breaks there's a killer
loose in the quarter,

37:12.545 --> 37:14.212
tourism is gonna drop,

37:14.213 --> 37:17.248
and who are your vampires
gonna feed on then?

37:17.249 --> 37:19.383
Locals? No.

37:19.384 --> 37:22.085
Not unless they want
a war with the covens!

37:24.288 --> 37:27.925
Speaking of covens,
you remember Davina,

37:27.926 --> 37:31.027
girl you were
supposed to mentor?

37:32.930 --> 37:34.765
I offered her my advice
months ago.

37:34.766 --> 37:38.267
I told her to make peace at
all cost, and she refused me.

37:38.268 --> 37:39.769
All right. That girl's got
a bigger chip on her shoulder

37:39.770 --> 37:40.871
than you do.

37:42.406 --> 37:44.474
You got her into this. You
should be helping her out.

37:44.475 --> 37:47.844
These witches keep messing with
her, she's gonna get angry.

37:47.845 --> 37:50.178
You think that's gonna
end well for anyone?

37:51.715 --> 37:53.949
Huh?

38:06.122 --> 38:08.531
What the hell am I doing here?

38:08.532 --> 38:10.665
Why am I trapped?

38:10.666 --> 38:12.199
I used magic to draw you here

38:12.200 --> 38:14.702
and to keep you
a captive audience.

38:14.703 --> 38:16.871
Davina, I need to see
my daughter.

38:16.872 --> 38:18.573
I'm sorry,

38:18.574 --> 38:21.675
but there's something I need
you to do for me first.

38:34.855 --> 38:36.523
Who's there?

38:36.524 --> 38:37.658
You're on edge.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.428
And you're trespassing.

38:41.429 --> 38:43.628
You can't just come... I
mean, Klaus, seriously.

38:43.630 --> 38:44.897
I didn't come here to quarrel.

38:44.898 --> 38:47.667
I came to offer you a gift,

38:47.668 --> 38:49.702
maybe in exchange
for one of our little chats

38:49.703 --> 38:51.470
of which I'm in particular need,

38:51.471 --> 38:53.439
given as my brother doesn't
bother to answer my calls,

38:53.440 --> 38:55.541
and now my old mate Lucien
has swanned into town

38:55.542 --> 38:57.309
with all manner
of troubling news.

38:57.310 --> 38:59.844
Fine. If you want to talk it
through, come back tomorrow.

39:01.479 --> 39:03.114
I'm afraid I need to
talk about it now.

39:03.115 --> 39:04.783
No. No!

39:04.784 --> 39:08.186
You don't get to just come
into my house uninvited.

39:08.187 --> 39:10.755
Well, you already invited me
in once, luv, so technically...

39:10.756 --> 39:12.023
Don't do that.

39:12.024 --> 39:14.024
Don't be so flippant
and self-absorbed.

39:14.026 --> 39:16.260
Right now, people like me are
out there getting killed

39:16.261 --> 39:17.428
by people like you,

39:17.429 --> 39:19.196
conveniently timed
with the arrival

39:19.197 --> 39:21.264
of your old acquaintance,

39:21.265 --> 39:23.833
and you just barge in here
and start mouthing off orders?

39:23.835 --> 39:25.535
I get it.
You're a vampire.

39:25.536 --> 39:27.037
It's a tortured existence.

39:27.038 --> 39:28.371
I'm sorry, but do you
really have to be

39:28.372 --> 39:30.573
such an insensitive
disappointment?

39:35.244 --> 39:37.279
Wait.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.147
That wasn't fair.

39:41.951 --> 39:43.585
Keep the gift.

39:45.421 --> 39:47.463
I painted it for you.

39:52.761 --> 39:54.128
Klaus.

40:13.313 --> 40:16.083
Good evening.

40:16.084 --> 40:17.718
I wonder if we might discuss

40:17.719 --> 40:19.819
your analysis of my work.

40:21.522 --> 40:22.857
Aah!

40:27.862 --> 40:29.797
Raah!

41:36.859 --> 41:38.366
Noooo!

41:53.608 --> 41:55.883
It won't be long now.
