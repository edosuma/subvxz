WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:04.169
ALL:
Road trip!

00:04.171 --> 00:05.004
NICK: See you guys.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.038
JESS:
Have a good time.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.206
SCHMIDT:
Let's go.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.607
We're just gonna
have a chill day in.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.175
WINSTON: Road trip!
NICK: Yeah!

00:10.177 --> 00:11.877
I said, "Chill day in..."

00:12.847 --> 00:14.213
...but did I mean it?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.681
(laughs)

00:15.683 --> 00:17.349
Wait, I thought we were
having a chill day.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.018
Oh... we are...

00:19.020 --> 00:20.786
Oh, good.
...not.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.854
Welcome to

00:21.856 --> 00:23.856
your bachelorette party 2.0.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.190
I got...

00:25.192 --> 00:26.492
the nail polish.
Mm.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.527
I got comfy socks.
Okay.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.296
I have Canadian
Broadcast Television's

00:31.298 --> 00:32.464
1985 masterpiece,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.466
<i> Anne of Green Gables.</i>

00:34.468 --> 00:35.467
Good ol' A.G.G.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.468
But, oh, wait...

00:36.470 --> 00:38.203
who invited this

00:38.205 --> 00:40.372
little green chimney?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.241
I-it's a bong.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.142
Yeah.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.710
Oh, scoot, once every ten years,

00:44.712 --> 00:46.812
Jessica Day likes to partake

00:46.814 --> 00:50.215
in what the Native Americans
call cannabis.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.250
That's Latin.
I like to call it

00:51.252 --> 00:52.317
Giggle Dirt.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.652
You know, we really don't

00:53.654 --> 00:54.987
have to do this,
because every time

00:54.989 --> 00:56.655
you smoke weed you almost die.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.158
I'm gonna<i> Jackass</i>
into these melons!

00:59.160 --> 01:00.325

01:17.845 --> 01:19.411
...what in heck are you doing?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.514
Fishing for lake trout.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.849
Hey.
Hmm?

01:23.851 --> 01:25.818
GILBERT: For lake trout?
Remember Coach?

01:27.354 --> 01:28.954
(laughing):
Oh, yeah.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.622
Where is he?

01:30.624 --> 01:32.991
♪ ♪

01:34.695 --> 01:37.096
Anne, wait, wait a minute.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.430
I was just down
at the post office

01:38.432 --> 01:39.631
to see if the Queens results...
Like, why...

01:39.633 --> 01:40.933
like, why...

01:40.935 --> 01:43.035
like why are Gilbert's
lips so sexual?

01:43.037 --> 01:46.638
Wait a minute, you ninny,
we tied for first place,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.107
you and I.
Man, I...

01:48.109 --> 01:50.375
I-I love Schmidt,
you know I love Schmidt,

01:50.377 --> 01:52.711
but I would throw it
all away for Gilbert.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.047
I would just ruin
my life to that boy.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.882
I'm just sorry you
had to share it with me.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.884
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.152
Wait a minute.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.820
The very fact that socks exist

02:01.822 --> 02:04.289
is proof that shoes don't work.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.724
Oh, my God, I... my hearing is,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.793
like, so good without
my glasses on.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.061
I'm, like...

02:09.063 --> 02:11.730
a super hear-o.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.664
Just...

02:12.666 --> 02:13.665
eating up sounds

02:13.667 --> 02:14.900
with my ear mouths.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.568
Oh, my God,
oh, my God,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.237
oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.507
Oh, my God,
wait till you try that.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.475
Okay.
Put them on.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.578
It's like my hearing is, like,
what a dog hears.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.347
ANNE: ...and I was calmly
waiting for it.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.582
I can hear the TV.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.351
I can hear
the TV.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.418
I can hear the TV.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.920
(sighs)
Man.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.088
Oh, my God.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.489
Okay, this stuff
is really strong.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.491
Where did you get it?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.360
I know people...

02:41.362 --> 02:43.195
through you.

02:43.197 --> 02:46.698
So, it's just gonna be me
and Cece, uh, but I want to,

02:46.700 --> 02:48.600
you know, throw a little...

02:48.602 --> 02:50.502
gasoline on the fire,
if you know what I mean.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.772
I have Russian
nesting doll.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.007
Uh-oh.

02:56.110 --> 02:56.942
It's grenade.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.043
Just looking for

02:58.045 --> 02:59.878
a little weed, Nadia.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.947
And what the heck, throw in
that bag of kettle corn, too.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.785
(laughs)

03:06.787 --> 03:09.021
(knocking on door)

03:10.391 --> 03:11.390
Oh, scoot!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.958
You got me a stripper?!

03:12.960 --> 03:14.126
So, uh, you want me to sign
my package, or...

03:14.128 --> 03:15.127
Wait, I think

03:15.129 --> 03:17.062
he's just a...
A man...

03:17.064 --> 03:19.131
trying to do my job for
the U.S. Postal Service,

03:19.133 --> 03:20.232
not a stripper.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.400
Yes, I dance.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.135
Yes, I'm sexy...

03:23.137 --> 03:24.403
but I don't do it
professionally.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.804
Now, could you please
just sign here?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.406
Your calves look
like a snake

03:27.408 --> 03:28.874
swallowed a bag of ropes.
You know that, right?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.142
I'm sorry for my friend

03:30.144 --> 03:31.476
objectifying you,

03:31.478 --> 03:34.813
but in her defense,
you are fine as hell.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.148
Fine as hell!

03:36.150 --> 03:37.316
I know you're
not a stripper,

03:37.318 --> 03:38.383
but is there any
way you could

03:38.385 --> 03:39.384
just take your
short pants off?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.419
Mm-hmm.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.486
(chuckles)
Have a nice day.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.487
Om, nom, nom,
nom, nom, nom, nom,

03:42.489 --> 03:43.722
nom, nom, nom.
Nom, nom, nom.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.324
Sorry.
Very sorry.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.758
Sorry, sorry. But we are
not sorry about that.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.660
Keep walking away there!
Oh, keep... slow...

03:48.662 --> 03:50.395
it down there for a second.
(whooping)

03:50.397 --> 03:51.396
Ay-ay-ay.
Ooh...

03:51.398 --> 03:52.831
(yelling<i> grito)</i>

03:52.833 --> 03:53.732
(both catcalling)

03:53.734 --> 03:55.601
Smack that! Sorry.
Ooh.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.836
(grunts)

03:57.838 --> 03:59.004
I think this is

03:59.006 --> 04:00.772
a gift from our registry.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.174
Wait, don't open it!

04:02.176 --> 04:03.508
What if i-inside of it

04:03.510 --> 04:06.078
is us, but we're older?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.846
I've no clue what this is.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.282
You know, Schmidt handled
everything from the registry.

04:11.252 --> 04:12.584
(scanner beeping)
Crockpot!

04:12.586 --> 04:13.785
Kettle, kettle!

04:13.787 --> 04:14.786
Espresso maker!

04:14.788 --> 04:15.754
Trivet!

04:15.756 --> 04:17.422
Melon baller!

04:18.425 --> 04:21.026
It's a bread maker?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.127
From...

04:22.129 --> 04:23.695
oh, from Schmidt's mom.

04:23.697 --> 04:27.532
"Cece, this bread maker
couldn't be easier to use.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.034
"It has one button.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.436
"Even you can do it
with a few tries.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.771
"Ha, ha,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.206
Louise."

04:34.208 --> 04:36.541
What does that mean?!

04:36.543 --> 04:38.377
Oh, no.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.378
She...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.046
Oh, no!

04:41.048 --> 04:42.314
I mean, is she trying to say

04:42.316 --> 04:45.150
that I can't even
push one button?

04:45.152 --> 04:47.119
She doesn't think
that I can take care

04:47.121 --> 04:48.954
of her precious, little boy.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.289
She doesn't like
that Schmidt does

04:50.291 --> 04:51.390
all the cooking...
Hold up,

04:51.392 --> 04:53.892
hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.894
This simple bitch

04:55.896 --> 04:57.262
wants you to be
some kind of

04:57.264 --> 04:58.397
June Cleaver, Betty Draper,

04:58.399 --> 05:00.399
Carol Brady wifey?!

05:00.401 --> 05:01.233
Mm-mm.
It is the

05:01.235 --> 05:02.501
21st century!
Uh-huh.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.835
Fifth generation feminism!

05:03.837 --> 05:05.504
Keep going.
Work-life balance!

05:05.506 --> 05:06.471
We need to rise up.
Yeah!

05:06.473 --> 05:09.574
22% less pay for the same job?!

05:09.576 --> 05:10.742
Don't tell me what to wax!

05:10.744 --> 05:12.411
Sideburn where my thigh turn.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.845
You know what we need
to do to this thing?!

05:13.847 --> 05:14.813
Bake bread in it!

05:14.815 --> 05:16.748
Wait, wait, wait!

05:16.750 --> 05:17.816
What, what?!

05:20.087 --> 05:22.254
You'll do a lot more
damage with this.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.388
This is why I love you.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.259
Homemade bread's
for Europeans!

05:27.261 --> 05:28.327
That's right!
Yeah!

05:28.329 --> 05:29.328
U.S.A.!

05:29.330 --> 05:32.030
BOTH:
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

05:32.032 --> 05:35.367
Oh, my God, I just realized
some day I'm gonna have

05:35.369 --> 05:38.003
to speak at my mother's funeral.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.504
Wow.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.873
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!

05:41.875 --> 05:42.874
(phone ringing) U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

05:42.876 --> 05:44.276
Oh, wait...
hey!

05:44.278 --> 05:46.111
We're coming up on
the rental place right now.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.512
I just got an
e-mail notification

05:47.514 --> 05:49.681
that our first wedding
gift has arrived.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.016
Oh, y-you did?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.284
Spoiler alert,

05:52.286 --> 05:54.686
it's a bread maker.
Bread maker.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.954
Cece, do me a favor
and bring it inside.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.189
It's in the hallway right now.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.390
Yeah, I'll-I'll go...

05:58.392 --> 05:59.691
I'll go get the...
the bread maker

05:59.693 --> 06:01.626
and bring it inside,
in one piece,

06:01.628 --> 06:02.694
safe and sound.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.795
I love you so much,
I got to go.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.297
SCHMIDT, NICK, WINSTON:
Bread maker!

06:05.299 --> 06:07.132
(phone beeps off)

06:07.134 --> 06:08.967
This was shipped
like this

06:08.969 --> 06:11.136
so we are gonna
need a new one.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.371
You obviously
broke this yourself.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.372
Uh...

06:13.374 --> 06:14.573
(laughs)

06:14.575 --> 06:15.974
...you obviously
broke it yourself.

06:15.976 --> 06:16.975
Yup.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.143
No.
(Jess laughs)

06:18.145 --> 06:19.311
You crushed it
with your mind.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.846
Okay, you're calling me a witch?
No, no, no,

06:20.848 --> 06:23.248
a sorceress,
a sorceress.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.383
You just have
magical powers,

06:24.385 --> 06:25.684
you don't like...

06:25.686 --> 06:27.219
I don't know how
I can help you today.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.220
It's like that episode of...

06:28.222 --> 06:29.221
remember that episode?

06:29.223 --> 06:30.255
Yeah.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.556
Of that... yeah.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.657
(sighs)

06:38.265 --> 06:39.431
So...

06:39.433 --> 06:41.233
Okay, so, like, um...

06:41.235 --> 06:43.635
how-how much would it...
would it be to replace it?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.605
It's $1,200.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.877
Is there a store
in the mall

06:51.879 --> 06:56.581
that sells $1,200
for, like, $50?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.120
How is this thing
so expensive?

07:02.122 --> 07:04.389
JESS: Aly!

07:04.391 --> 07:06.458
What are you doing here?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.059
Seriously?

07:08.061 --> 07:09.628
We just had this conversation
outside the mall.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.762
Hey.
JESS: Aly!

07:10.764 --> 07:12.264
What are you doing here?

07:12.266 --> 07:13.799
You don't... remember that?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.634
No, no, I do, I do.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.469
You don't, do you?
I don't.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.570
(Jess laughs)

07:18.572 --> 07:20.138
I don't.
I do.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.807
Really? No. Okay.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.475
It's Cece's bachelorette party.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.444
Yeah...

07:25.446 --> 07:27.379
It's Cece's
bachelorette party.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.547
Oh, yeah.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.815
You do remember it? No. (laughs)

07:29.817 --> 07:30.649
Don't remember it?

07:30.651 --> 07:31.783
Mm-mm.
Anyway...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.318
this is my super

07:33.320 --> 07:34.986
present boyfriend, Tripp.

07:34.988 --> 07:35.954
I'm sorry,

07:35.956 --> 07:36.922
he's dealing with a very

07:36.924 --> 07:38.123
important work crisis

07:38.125 --> 07:40.258
right now,
since he's an agent

07:40.260 --> 07:41.827
for animal actors.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.328
Fine, fine!

07:43.330 --> 07:44.830
Hire Colonel Fantastic
instead of Maurice.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.431
You want to walk onto
Alfonso Cuarón's set

07:46.433 --> 07:48.266
and tell him that
he lost his lead otter,

07:48.268 --> 07:49.801
be my-be my guest, okay.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.336
Who's gonna get her in the water
with Naomi Watts?

07:51.338 --> 07:52.838
Colonel Fantastic?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.606
Yeah, right.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.475
It's my fifth year
anniversary of being a cop

07:56.477 --> 07:58.443
and he's supposed
to make me dinner...

07:58.445 --> 08:00.345
if he ever gets off the phone.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.680
Hey, babe,

08:01.682 --> 08:03.181
I need a left-handed
spatula, okay?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.916
Don't tell me it's not
a thing; it's a thing.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.853
Soul mates do exist.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.854
(laughs)

08:08.856 --> 08:09.855
What a wang.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.022
(both chuckle)

08:11.024 --> 08:12.023
You know what?
Hmm?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.191
(gasps)

08:13.193 --> 08:14.626
I'm gonna tell Aly that

08:14.628 --> 08:16.294
Winston's in love with her!

08:16.296 --> 08:17.696
No, Winston would kill you.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.164
Okay, I'll just text Winston

08:19.166 --> 08:20.866
and I'll get him up to speed

08:20.868 --> 08:22.033
on Aly and Tripp.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.172
(humming):
Nailed it.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.507
Excuse me,
are you actually

08:28.509 --> 08:29.508
gonna buy something?

08:29.510 --> 08:30.709
Yeah, we need
to buy another

08:30.711 --> 08:32.043
bread maker,
'cause you claim

08:32.045 --> 08:34.346
we "destroyed" this one
"with a stick."

08:34.348 --> 08:36.147
I never said stick
and we're out of stock.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.883
Well, maybe that's
what you said.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.718
You destroyed this
thing with the stock.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.719
Is that what you did?

08:40.721 --> 08:41.720
You beat this with a stick?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.889
No, I didn't, I said you said...

08:43.891 --> 08:45.724
you said stick.
But I didn't say stick.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.658
I never said stick.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.559
I don't even have a stick.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.960
I live downtown.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.829
Well, we're-we're
out of stock, so...

08:50.831 --> 08:51.897
But you-you have
one right there.

08:51.899 --> 08:52.831
(gasps)
Oh...

08:52.833 --> 08:54.232
that's the floor model.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.567
Can't sell the floor model.
Yes, you...

08:55.569 --> 08:57.202
it's right there.
It's right there.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.236
We need it to sell
other bread makers.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.571
You just said

08:59.573 --> 09:01.339
you don't have
other bread makers.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.240
I don't make the rules.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.542
Who makes the rules?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.210
Derek.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.511
(inhaling)

09:06.513 --> 09:07.913
Definitely too high
No, I cannot deal

09:07.915 --> 09:10.448
to talk to Derek.
with Derek right now.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.919
Okay, I have a really
good plan, all right?

09:13.921 --> 09:16.187
We just leave this here

09:16.189 --> 09:17.923
and then we go do
something different.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.925
Jessica, that is the first thing

09:19.927 --> 09:22.193
that Schmidt and I own together
and I ruined it.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.662
I have to do something.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.430
I have to replace it.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.765
(sighs)

09:26.767 --> 09:28.667
Okay.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.110

10:47.948 --> 10:49.347
Uh, because he's not

10:49.349 --> 10:51.116
a library owl,
he's a horror movie owl.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.517
Look,

10:52.519 --> 10:54.486
we're gonna do your cop
dinner thing tomorrow.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.021
(sighs)

10:56.023 --> 10:57.856
Yeah, this is just how
I wanted to celebrate a major

10:57.858 --> 10:59.791
milestone. (gasps)
What's happening there?

10:59.793 --> 11:00.992
Forget it, okay? Just go.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.093
And I hope your owl

11:02.095 --> 11:03.628
chokes on a mouse.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.197
That is so mean.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.332
I've seen that happen.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.201
(gasps)
Did they just break up?

11:10.203 --> 11:11.670
This is huge for Winston.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.005
What are you... what...
Hey, Jess, move.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.340
Jess, move, come on.
Keep moving.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.342
Keep moving, keep moving,
keep moving.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.678
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.679
Almost there,
almost there.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.680
ALY: Ugh.
Oh!

11:21.682 --> 11:22.881
Tripp just took off.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.049
What, uh...

11:24.051 --> 11:25.884
are... what are you guys doing?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.552
BOTH: Nothing. Do you
need help with that box?

11:27.554 --> 11:28.486
Nope.
No, we're good.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.521
It looks heavy,
I can help you.

11:29.523 --> 11:30.889
No, you don't want
to get involved,

11:30.891 --> 11:31.990
trust me. Please,
don't make me say it.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.858
Fine, I'll say it.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.561
I don't really want to be alone
right now, and so...

11:36.563 --> 11:39.230
can I please just... like,
come help you guys

11:39.232 --> 11:40.365
make bread or whatever?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.900
Aw, of course, yeah.
Let's go.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.034
Got to go quickly,
got to go quickly.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.035
Yeah, yeah,
let's go, let's go.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.670
Did you trash
the display?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.739
Is that a stolen floor model?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.407
Back off!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.643
Do these ladies look like
shoplifters to you?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.914
Oh, no.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.182
What are you doing?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.516
This isn't how you
handcuff people.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.517
It's mall jail.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.585
I only have
two handcuffs.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.753
I'm an actual cop.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.754
(laughing):
Yeah, right.

12:02.756 --> 12:03.922
I'm a cop!

12:03.924 --> 12:05.356
For the love of
mack daddy,

12:05.358 --> 12:07.092
why can't you be cool?
Shut it!

12:07.094 --> 12:08.093
You're in my house now.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.861
Calm down, sir,
your house is clearly

12:09.863 --> 12:11.096
a lost and found.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.098
JESS:
And it's all just baby shoes...

12:13.100 --> 12:14.599
and babies don't
even need shoes.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.701
Why not put that money
towards something worthwhile

12:16.703 --> 12:18.703
like a cute hat or a raincoat?

12:18.705 --> 12:20.605
(laughing):
A baby in a raincoat.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.941
It's like... just like a...

12:22.943 --> 12:24.876
a little baby meteorologist.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.077
(laughs)

12:26.079 --> 12:27.579
Hey, so, it's this simple, okay.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.913
We wanted to pay
for the bread maker,

12:28.915 --> 12:30.281
but they wouldn't
let us pay for it

12:30.283 --> 12:31.583
because it was a floor model,

12:31.585 --> 12:33.351
so we had a plan...
I don't care.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.589
(laughs)
(lock clicks)

12:37.591 --> 12:38.790
(laughs)

12:38.792 --> 12:40.458
Baby in a raincoat.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.626
(Jess laughing)

12:46.133 --> 12:47.132
This is bad, you guys.
This is really bad!

12:47.134 --> 12:48.133
He's gonna call
the real cops

12:48.135 --> 12:49.634
and I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.302
I could lose my job...

12:51.304 --> 12:52.771
or worse...

12:52.773 --> 12:53.805
(gasps)

12:53.807 --> 12:55.273
...they put me on train duty.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.308
I'm so sorry we got you
in this situation, okay.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.077
I am so sorry, too.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.478
Okay, how do we
get out of here?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.247
How, how?
Before the cops come.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.281
Oh!

13:03.283 --> 13:04.983
Yes, okay, guys,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.785
here's how we get out of here.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.953
We dress up in the clothes
from the lost and found,

13:08.955 --> 13:10.755
and we start crying,

13:10.757 --> 13:13.625
and then he comes back in and
he's like, "Where are the girls?

13:13.627 --> 13:16.327
This is just babies in here."

13:16.329 --> 13:17.729
You're incredibly high.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.664
No.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.299
Yeah.
No.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.001
Mm-hmm.
No. No.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.636
Yeah. Yeah. Who?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.671
You. You, babe.
How did you know?

13:26.673 --> 13:28.439
Oh, I knew from the
first second I saw you.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.974
Like, literally
the first second.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.643
Okay, ideas,
you, go.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.145
Oh, no, no, no,
I am not giving you any ideas

13:34.147 --> 13:36.981
because it was my idea
that got us into this mess

13:36.983 --> 13:38.183
in the first place.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.851
First...

13:39.853 --> 13:42.987
I bashed Schmidt's
$1,200 bread maker.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.289
$1,200?
Yeah.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.957
(gasps) For a bread maker?
I know.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.259
That's a lot of dough.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.696
I'm trying to wink.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.864
Am I winking?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.300
Then I got
my best friend here

13:55.302 --> 13:56.701
to commit a crime,

13:56.703 --> 13:59.838
and now you might have...
train duty?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.307
It's like marathon duty
but without the hot guys

14:02.309 --> 14:03.541
pooping their pants.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.043
What does that say about me

14:05.045 --> 14:08.513
if I can't even take care
of a bread maker?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.014
What if Louise was right?

14:10.016 --> 14:12.150
What if I can't take care
of Schmidt?

14:12.152 --> 14:15.053
How can you say you don't
take care of people?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.889
You've been taking care
of me my entire life.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.557
You're fierce
and you are strong,

14:19.559 --> 14:23.361
and you would stand up
for anyone that you love.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.730
You're like a big,
scary mama bear.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.233
I'm gonna<i> Jackass</i>
into these melons!

14:28.235 --> 14:29.500
(grunting)

14:29.502 --> 14:30.702
JESS:
Ah...

14:30.704 --> 14:33.471
(Jess laughing)

14:36.009 --> 14:38.076
I'm okay.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.911
(sighs)

14:39.913 --> 14:42.247
You're my mama bear, girl.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.915
Oh...

14:43.917 --> 14:46.017
I wish I had someone

14:46.019 --> 14:47.585
in my life who cared
about me the way

14:47.587 --> 14:48.753
you guys care
about each other.

14:48.755 --> 14:49.888
(gasps)

14:49.890 --> 14:51.656
(whispering):
Oh, don't.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.424
(whispering): You do. I just...
I've been a cop

14:53.426 --> 14:55.393

You do.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.494
Jessica!

14:56.496 --> 14:57.562
...I just wanted
to celebrate it,

14:57.564 --> 14:59.597
(mouthing) but then
Tripp had to leave

14:59.599 --> 15:01.266
to meet an owl for sushi.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.601
An owl he sent
a basket of mice

15:03.603 --> 15:05.770
to at Christmas, who

15:05.772 --> 15:07.772
I'm pretty sure has
a nicer house than me.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.540
(gasps)
Let me tell her... please!

15:09.542 --> 15:10.942
(door opens)
I'll blame it on being stoned.

15:10.944 --> 15:11.943
Stoned?

15:11.945 --> 15:13.611
You're stoned?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.079
That makes this a drug case.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.047
Okay, yeah, you have no idea

15:16.049 --> 15:17.448
what you're talking about.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.917
Wait, no, I made a mistake.
You better get

15:18.919 --> 15:20.551

you're gonna be here

15:20.553 --> 15:22.053

You know what?

15:29.462 --> 15:31.296

15:31.298 --> 15:32.630
The only way you

15:32.632 --> 15:34.098
are gonna get to her

15:34.100 --> 15:35.800
is if you go through me,

Oh, Aly, um...

that means to you,
