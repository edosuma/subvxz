00:56.867 --> 00:59.434
...like I do
in my living room.

00:59.468 --> 01:00.767
Oh.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.800
( <i>growls</i> )

01:05.867 --> 01:07.034
Hey, Louie.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.368
What table you sitting at?

01:09.401 --> 01:10.533
This one.

01:10.567 --> 01:12.067
Thanks for the tip.

01:14.234 --> 01:16.567
John, you got change
for a dollar?

01:16.600 --> 01:18.301
Sure.

01:24.401 --> 01:26.134
You gave me
a dollar ten.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.734
Oh, I'm sorry.
Too late.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.434
Oh, well.

01:31.934 --> 01:34.533
BOBBY:
Oh, no.
Louie's going to play

01:34.567 --> 01:36.468
his favorite song.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.633
Oh, no. Every time
he's in a bar.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.067
Yeah.
"The Green Berets."

01:40.101 --> 01:42.201
Yeah.

01:42.234 --> 01:45.567
* Feelings

01:45.600 --> 01:49.201
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings

01:49.234 --> 01:51.633
Why is he playing
that song?

01:51.667 --> 01:52.900
It's different.

01:52.934 --> 01:55.700
It's not any better,
but it's different.

01:55.734 --> 01:57.767
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...

01:57.800 --> 02:00.101
He's giving me
a feeling.

02:00.134 --> 02:03.934
* Feelings

02:03.967 --> 02:08.334
BOTH:
* Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings

02:08.368 --> 02:12.167
* Whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:13.633 --> 02:16.567
* Whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:16.600 --> 02:17.567
Hi.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.834
How you doing?

02:18.867 --> 02:19.967
Terrific. Hey,
you look great.

02:20.001 --> 02:21.368
Thanks.

02:21.401 --> 02:22.533
How's it going, Alex?

02:22.567 --> 02:23.734
Oh, fine, just fine.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.067
Okay.
I'll have a white wine.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.001
Beer.

02:26.034 --> 02:27.600
Beer.
And a bourbon and water.

02:27.633 --> 02:28.600
Beer, please.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.334
Okay.

02:30.368 --> 02:34.734
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

02:34.767 --> 02:37.468
...with a twist.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.468
Gee, I'm sorry.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.667
We're out of that.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.600
Thank you very much.

02:50.767 --> 02:53.434
Well, there's a man
who knows what he likes.

02:53.468 --> 02:55.067
Yeah.

02:55.101 --> 02:57.334
* Feelings

02:57.368 --> 02:59.700
* Whoa, whoa, whoa...

02:59.734 --> 03:02.401
You know, it would be nice
if one of you guys

03:02.434 --> 03:05.834
went over there and got him
out of his misery.

03:05.867 --> 03:07.267
You okay, Alex?

03:08.900 --> 03:10.700
Excuse me.
I'll go with you.

03:10.734 --> 03:13.368
No, I'm going to talk
to Beverly.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.767
JOHN:
Good luck.
Thanks.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.301
Hey, uh, Beverly...
listen, I got some bad news.

03:17.334 --> 03:18.734
I went to the doctor.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.201
He told me
I only had 40 years to live.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.934
I don't know what to do
with all that time,

03:23.967 --> 03:26.167
so would you go out with me
Saturday night?

03:26.201 --> 03:28.633
Thanks, anyway,
but I can't.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.234
It's because
I was kidding around, huh?

03:30.267 --> 03:32.567
I have this terrible habit--
I like to make girls laugh.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.034
Kitchy-kitchy...
( <i>screams</i> )

03:34.067 --> 03:35.368
There, I did it again.

03:35.401 --> 03:37.201
No, look, I really want
to take you out.

03:37.234 --> 03:38.700
What night are you free?

03:38.734 --> 03:40.567
I'm sorry, Alex. I can't.

03:40.600 --> 03:41.734
Why not?
Because I make it a rule

03:41.767 --> 03:43.900
not to go out
with cab drivers.

03:43.934 --> 03:46.001
Well, that's a stupid rule.

03:46.034 --> 03:47.633
Well, it's very important to me

03:47.667 --> 03:49.867
to keep my personal life
private, you know?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.500
And this is a cabbie's hangout.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.767
I mean, if I was a secretary
on Wall Street,

03:53.800 --> 03:55.867
I wouldn't go out
with the stockbrokers.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.667
If I was in a factory,

03:57.700 --> 03:59.234
I wouldn't go out
with factory workers.

03:59.267 --> 04:00.401
If I was a nurse
in a hospital,

04:00.434 --> 04:02.001
I wouldn't go out
with the sick people.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.267
No. You mean you wouldn't
go out with doctors.

04:04.301 --> 04:06.967
Hey, I have my rules,
but I'm not crazy.

04:09.633 --> 04:14.101
* Feelings

04:14.134 --> 04:19.034
* Whoa, whoa, whoa,
feelings *

04:19.067 --> 04:22.034
* Whoa, whoa, whoa,
fee... *

04:22.067 --> 04:23.767
Hey, who killed
the music?

04:23.800 --> 04:26.600
You did.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.368
Alex, I need...
I need that song.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.700
I'm real down.

04:29.734 --> 04:31.368
I need that song
real bad.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.900
Louie, I'll give
you a buck,

04:32.934 --> 04:34.734
you don't play that song again.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.700
Okay.

04:48.468 --> 04:50.468
Aw, you're better off
without her.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.334
Uh-uh. Try again.

04:52.368 --> 04:55.234
Can I sit down?

04:55.267 --> 04:56.401
No.

04:56.434 --> 04:58.134
It's been
a rough night.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.734
All right, all right.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.633
As long as

05:01.667 --> 05:03.667
you're not obnoxious.

05:07.034 --> 05:10.334
So what are you
losers up to?

05:10.368 --> 05:12.001
That was obnoxious?

05:12.034 --> 05:13.334
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:13.368 --> 05:15.368
Okay, okay.

05:17.034 --> 05:18.334
I apologize.

05:18.368 --> 05:20.401
Whoo!
Whoo!

05:22.734 --> 05:25.368
You bet, whoo.

05:25.401 --> 05:28.034
That's the first time
I ever apologized.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.734
But I did it
because there's something

05:30.767 --> 05:32.301
I really have to say.

05:32.334 --> 05:33.434
What's wrong?

05:33.468 --> 05:35.533
I got a letter

05:35.567 --> 05:40.034
inviting me
to my 20th high school reunion

05:40.067 --> 05:43.134
next Saturday...
and I'm not going.

05:43.167 --> 05:45.034
So what? I don't go
to my high school reunions.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.500
Who wants to sit around

05:46.533 --> 05:48.500
and watch a bunch of guys
sucking in their stomachs?

05:48.533 --> 05:49.600
What good would that do?

05:49.633 --> 05:50.934
No, you don't
understand.

05:50.967 --> 05:53.368
I'd really like to go.

05:53.401 --> 05:57.401
You see, everything was really
tough for me in high school.

05:57.434 --> 06:01.401
Everybody was crummy
to me all the time.

06:01.434 --> 06:04.401
The only thing
that kept me going

06:04.434 --> 06:07.334
was these two promises
I made to myself.

06:07.368 --> 06:11.334
One was I would get
Sheila Martin to like me.

06:11.368 --> 06:15.967
And, two, that I'd get even
with everybody else.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.234
Gee, you really had it
that tough in high school?

06:18.267 --> 06:20.533
Oh, look, it's nothing personal,
but I put in 12 hours today...

06:20.567 --> 06:22.267
Everybody used to pick on me.

06:22.301 --> 06:25.067
I don't mean just
as I passed them in the halls.

06:25.101 --> 06:27.700
I mean, they used to line up
and take turns.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.034
I used to just
stand there
and wait

06:29.067 --> 06:31.700
for the last guy
to take his shot.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.567
Yeah, we get the idea, Louie.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.533
Yeah, and that's only
the top of the iceberg.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.500
I got stories
that will tear your hearts out.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.034
Like what?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.800
Did I offend you
in any way, Elaine?

06:42.834 --> 06:44.700
No. I just want
to hear what happened.

06:44.734 --> 06:46.900
He's never opened up
to us like this before.

06:46.934 --> 06:48.834
And the world has
never come to an end,

06:48.867 --> 06:51.201
but that doesn't mean
we root for it to happen.

06:51.234 --> 06:52.533
Another beer, please.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.034
Make it two.

06:55.067 --> 06:59.034
There was this guy,
Stanley Tarsus.

06:59.067 --> 07:01.401
He was a really nasty,
rotten person.

07:01.434 --> 07:03.434
You know the type?

07:03.468 --> 07:04.900
ALL:
Yeah.

07:04.934 --> 07:09.967
He used to play this one trick
on me all the time

07:10.001 --> 07:14.134
just to show that I would fall
for it every time he did it.

07:14.167 --> 07:14.900
What did he do?

07:14.934 --> 07:16.667
Alex, you got something

07:16.700 --> 07:18.001
on your shirt.

07:18.034 --> 07:20.034
That!

07:20.067 --> 07:23.368
Rotten person--
Stanley Tarsus.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.401
That ain't such
a bad story.

07:25.434 --> 07:29.167
There was this guy in my
high school, Lou Vanelli--

07:29.201 --> 07:31.767
he used to tear
your chest hair out

07:31.800 --> 07:33.301
with his bare hands.

07:33.334 --> 07:35.134
Gee, I miss those days.

07:35.167 --> 07:40.633
Okay, get ready
to sob your spleens out.

07:40.667 --> 07:45.468
I went to my high school
senior prom alone.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.600
The theme was "April love."

07:48.633 --> 07:49.600
April love?

07:49.633 --> 07:51.834
Is for the very young.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.600
The only reason

07:53.633 --> 07:55.500
I went to the prom

07:55.533 --> 07:58.700
was because, even though
she was with another guy,

07:58.734 --> 08:02.667
I just wanted to see what Sheila
looked like on prom night.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.734
That's how hooked I was on her.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.834
So I walk in,

08:06.867 --> 08:08.834
I say hello to a few people--

08:08.867 --> 08:11.001
"Hello, hello, hello."

08:11.034 --> 08:13.301
I tell them my date was delayed.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.001
She couldn't make it

08:15.034 --> 08:18.334
until after her Broadway show's
curtain came down.

08:19.401 --> 08:21.633
I had to make up
stories like that.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.201
ELAINE:
Aw, Louie.

08:23.234 --> 08:25.667
If you're trying to make me
feel better

08:25.700 --> 08:27.767
how about being a little bolder?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.034
Stop it.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.700
So what happened then?

08:30.734 --> 08:32.368
I kept on looking
for Sheila

08:32.400 --> 08:34.134
and this guy
comes up to me--

08:34.167 --> 08:36.167
Stanley Tarsus,
you remember him?

08:36.201 --> 08:38.067
Yeah. The nose guy.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.368
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.400
He comes up to me,
and he says,

08:41.433 --> 08:44.368
"Hey, Louie, how'd you like
to sit at a table

08:44.401 --> 08:46.201
with us and Sheila?"

08:46.234 --> 08:48.667
I smiled at him.
I didn't want nothing

08:48.700 --> 08:51.401
but to just sit
where I could look at her.

08:51.434 --> 08:54.967
So I walked through
this crowded gymnasium

08:55.001 --> 08:56.834
and I see Sheila.

08:56.867 --> 09:00.234
She looked so beautiful.

09:00.267 --> 09:03.700
She looked
just like a beautician.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.900
Wow!

09:10.700 --> 09:13.401
And I could see
she was smiling big.

09:13.434 --> 09:15.800
And everybody said, "Hey, Louie,

09:15.834 --> 09:19.101
come on over
and sit next to Sheila."

09:19.134 --> 09:22.633
And I figured,
"Boy, I lucked out."

09:22.667 --> 09:26.633
And I moved over
to the other side,

09:26.667 --> 09:29.401
and I saw they had
a high chair there.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.101
ALL:
Aw.

09:31.134 --> 09:34.734
Well, what did
you do, Louie?

09:34.767 --> 09:36.533
Man, what did you do?

09:36.567 --> 09:39.368
I says to them,
"Okay, you did it.

09:39.401 --> 09:41.001
"You got me good.

09:41.034 --> 09:42.700
Enjoy yourselves."

09:42.734 --> 09:44.401
They sure took my advice.

09:44.434 --> 09:46.934
They were still
laughing when I left.

09:46.967 --> 09:51.567
And I went home,
and I swore to myself then

09:51.600 --> 09:55.500
that one day I'd come
back a big shot--

09:55.533 --> 09:57.867
with all the money there was--

09:57.900 --> 10:01.234
and I'd walk into one
of their high school reunions

10:01.267 --> 10:03.567
and make them all eat crackers,

10:03.600 --> 10:05.434
if you know what I mean.

10:07.468 --> 10:10.767
And now,
20 years later,

10:10.800 --> 10:14.767
I'm not sure
being a taxi dispatcher

10:14.800 --> 10:17.034
is enough to do the job.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.633
Well, why don't you
just go in there and lie?

10:22.667 --> 10:24.267
Everybody lies.

10:24.301 --> 10:26.600
It's too big a job.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.800
It's got to be done great.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.834
I'm not a good enough actor.

10:30.867 --> 10:34.267
You know, I can't believe
you just said that, Louie.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.134
It's true.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.900
Yeah, I know, but,
like, incredible.

10:36.934 --> 10:38.468
It's what I was just thinking.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.301
What?

10:39.334 --> 10:40.667
Okay, now,

10:40.700 --> 10:43.401
the important thing
is that they're convinced

10:43.434 --> 10:45.301
that you turned out great,
right?

10:45.334 --> 10:46.067
Yeah.

10:46.101 --> 10:49.334
It's basically an acting job.

10:49.368 --> 10:52.734
Ohh, I know what
you're thinking.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.667
That would be great!

10:54.700 --> 10:56.834
What would be great?
I want great.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.001
Yeah?
You're kidding.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.800
I mean, do you
really think so?

10:59.834 --> 11:01.334
Don't tease.

11:01.368 --> 11:02.734
All right.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.934
Let me explain
one thing to
start out with.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.567
Now, I've been
studying you for
a long time, Louie.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.101
And I know that,
if I ever got
any acting breaks,

11:10.134 --> 11:12.334
that I'd want to use,
like, a lot of things

11:12.368 --> 11:13.967
that you have
in certain roles.

11:14.001 --> 11:16.500
I mean, you're
an extraordinary
character, Louie.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.800
Yeah, so?

11:18.834 --> 11:20.700
Sometimes, when
you're yelling at me,

11:20.734 --> 11:22.834
I can't concentrate
on what you're saying

11:22.867 --> 11:26.001
'cause what I'm concentrating
on are your character traits--

11:26.034 --> 11:27.900
you know,
the way your eyes pop out,

11:27.934 --> 11:30.301
and the way that vein
stands out in your neck,

11:30.334 --> 11:33.001
and the spit that gets
in the corner of your mouth.

11:33.034 --> 11:36.001
Yeah.

11:36.034 --> 11:37.434
It's everything, you know?

11:37.468 --> 11:39.867
The way you walk,
the way you use your voice.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.167
I want the part, Louie.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.600
I want to go
into that reunion

11:42.633 --> 11:44.633
and convince them
that I'm Louie De Palma.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.700
Now, maybe I can't get
any acting jobs

11:46.734 --> 11:48.301
but, if I can pull this off,

11:48.334 --> 11:50.834
I know I'm going
in the right direction.

11:50.867 --> 11:53.067
Let me do it, Louie.
I want to do it.

11:53.101 --> 11:54.533
Let me be Louie De Palma

11:54.567 --> 11:56.067
at the reunion.

11:56.101 --> 11:58.468
It's impossible.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.034
It's not.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.034
It's 20 years later, right?

12:02.067 --> 12:03.700
Everybody's changed.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.533
I'll make my hair dark.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.034
I grew in college.

12:07.067 --> 12:09.468
I'm too complex a person.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.800
You can't be me.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.633
( <i>imitating Louie:</i> )
You can't be me.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.800
It won't work.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.167
It won't work.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.867
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.234
You can't talk
like me.
You can't talk
like me.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.234
Maybe it would work.
Maybe it
would work.

12:38.167 --> 12:42.167
( <i>"A Summer Place" playing</i> )

13:11.401 --> 13:15.368
My name's Louie De Palma.

13:15.401 --> 13:18.401
May I have my tag, please?

13:22.368 --> 13:24.234
Thanks.

13:24.267 --> 13:25.567
Louie?

13:25.600 --> 13:28.167
Louie De Palma?

13:28.201 --> 13:29.334
Yeah.

13:29.368 --> 13:30.900
George. Georgie Wilson.

13:30.934 --> 13:32.800
George!

13:32.834 --> 13:34.767
Gee, you've
changed so much.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.234
You look taller.

13:36.267 --> 13:37.567
Well, yeah.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.401
It's a weird thing.

13:39.434 --> 13:41.267
I shot up
in college.

13:41.301 --> 13:44.234
They wrote it up
in all the
medical journals.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.167
Well, it's great
to see you again.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.401
Who we kidding?

13:47.434 --> 13:49.368
It wasn't so hot
the first time.

13:49.401 --> 13:50.967
Hey, George,
seen Sheila?

13:51.001 --> 13:52.967
Sure. She's
right over there.

13:53.001 --> 13:54.167
Thanks.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.234
Hi.

14:05.267 --> 14:07.301
Oh, hi.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.434
Pretty tame reunion, huh?

14:09.468 --> 14:13.034
I got a hunch it's going
to liven up some.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.301
Louie?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.967
Uh, Louie De Palma?

14:17.001 --> 14:18.301
Louie?!

14:18.334 --> 14:19.633
I'd stop you,

14:19.667 --> 14:22.368
but I like the sound
of your voice.

14:22.401 --> 14:23.533
But... I mean...

14:23.567 --> 14:25.134
But what? You're surprised

14:25.167 --> 14:27.067
I'm too big
for the high chair?

14:27.101 --> 14:27.967
What do you mean?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.468
You don't remember?

14:29.500 --> 14:32.101
Senior prom, April love.

14:32.134 --> 14:33.700
I come over.

14:33.734 --> 14:35.201
High chair.

14:35.234 --> 14:36.368
Huh, huh, huh?

14:36.401 --> 14:39.533
Oh, yeah, I did
do that, didn't I?

14:39.567 --> 14:40.867
Did you...?

14:40.900 --> 14:42.867
it was just
the group, Louie.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.034
I mean, a bunch
of us got high

14:45.067 --> 14:47.201
even before we got
to the prom.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.900
I'm so embarrassed.

14:48.934 --> 14:52.900
I don't know how
I'm going to
make it up to you.

14:52.934 --> 14:57.767
Well, uh, that's one
of the purposes of this evening.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.368
To figure it out.

14:59.401 --> 15:01.734
May I have this dance?

15:17.734 --> 15:21.301
Wonder how I'm doing
at the reunion.

15:21.334 --> 15:24.401
I'm sure you're
doing great, Louie.

15:28.301 --> 15:31.533
It was swell of Bobby
to go for me.

15:31.567 --> 15:34.234
I wonder if he met Sheila yet.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.734
Yeah, he might be with her
right now.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.700
Must be something really lousy
with my life

15:39.734 --> 15:43.368
if I couldn't go there
and admit I was a dispatcher.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.800
Oh, everyone's a little unhappy,

15:45.834 --> 15:47.934
wishing they
were doing
something else.

15:47.967 --> 15:50.301
( <i>speaking</i>
<i>native language</i> )

15:50.334 --> 15:54.334
Hey, you're wearing
your jacket tonight.

15:54.368 --> 15:57.034
Yeah. Hard to tell
I'm a cab driver, huh?

15:57.067 --> 15:59.468
Till I stand, and
you hear the rattle

15:59.500 --> 16:01.067
of $70 in change.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.800
What?

16:09.834 --> 16:12.001
Would you quit
kidding around
for just a minute?

16:12.034 --> 16:13.301
Oh.
Did you hear
what's happening

16:13.334 --> 16:14.600
at the reunion tonight?

16:14.633 --> 16:16.667
Is Bobby still going
through with it?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.234
Yeah, he's going
through with it.

16:18.267 --> 16:19.800
He's got
an incredible disguise.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.633
That's him
right there.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.368
Alex, just be sure
and tell me the details

16:25.401 --> 16:27.667
when you find out
what's happening.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.267
I really do
want to hear.

16:29.301 --> 16:31.134
Really?
Mm-hmm.

16:31.167 --> 16:33.201
Hey, Louie, would
you mind paying now?

16:33.234 --> 16:34.934
I'm getting off
in five minutes.

16:34.967 --> 16:36.134
That's all right.

16:36.167 --> 16:37.633
I'll take care of it.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.101
Hey, uh,
what if I walked you home?

16:40.134 --> 16:41.700
Don't be hard on us.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.368
Come on, we've
been through this.

16:43.401 --> 16:45.101
No, it's not what
you're thinking.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.267
Haven't you heard?
The news is full of it.

16:47.301 --> 16:49.734
Packs of wild dogs
roaming the streets.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.134
I just thought you might
want someone along

16:52.167 --> 16:53.767
to hurl his body at them.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.468
Listen, I'll
see you tomorrow.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.434
I want you to give me
all the details, okay?

17:00.533 --> 17:03.001
And they say
rejection isn't fun.

17:03.034 --> 17:04.434
You know,
I'm dying here,

17:04.468 --> 17:06.700
not knowing what's
going on over there.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.233
You know
what I mean? Huh?

17:08.267 --> 17:09.733
Yeah.

17:09.767 --> 17:13.733
What would be the harm
if I just strolled over there

17:13.767 --> 17:15.134
and took a peek?

17:15.166 --> 17:16.800
No, no, eh, no.

( <i>speaking native language</i> )

17:18.900 --> 17:20.201
No.

a remote possibility.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.967
No.

( <i>speaking native language</i> )

you're going to go
to the reunion tonight?

17:43.700 --> 17:45.034
Yeah, I'm going to go.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.267
You want to come?

17:48.301 --> 17:51.034
Just the question
I wanted to hear.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.368
Yeah, I would.

17:52.401 --> 17:53.700
Okay, let's go.

'Cause Louie decided
to go over to the reunion

Hi, Stanley.

Oh, real good.

Real good.

Oh, sure.

you're wearing there,

Stanley, my man.

20:06.934 --> 20:08.533
Hey, you must be
doing real good.

20:08.567 --> 20:11.533
Oh, I have no complaints,
financially speaking.

20:11.567 --> 20:12.934
Is that right?

20:12.967 --> 20:16.600
Yeah. You see, I'm a waiter
at the Park Pavilion.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.434
Oh, great.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.900
They promoted you
from busboy.

20:20.934 --> 20:22.900
I don't think
you understand.

20:22.934 --> 20:26.500
That means that
I make $20,000 a year.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.001
That's just in salary.

20:28.034 --> 20:31.001
I make another
$40,000 in tips,

20:31.034 --> 20:33.334
of which I declare
about $10,000,

20:33.368 --> 20:37.767
which gives me the equivalent
of about $100,000 a year.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.267
Now, how are
you doing, Louie?

20:40.301 --> 20:43.434
Well, not nearly as good,
I'm afraid to say.

20:43.468 --> 20:45.934
I've only got
a civil service job.

20:45.967 --> 20:49.468
I'm an auditor for the
Internal Revenue Service.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.934
Not a good night
for you, is it, Stan?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.533
Especially
with you being

21:01.567 --> 21:03.867
on your way to jail
and everything.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.767
Ooh! Ooh! You even
spilled something
on your tie.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.934
Where?

21:07.967 --> 21:09.134
There.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.201
You are quite a man,
Louie De Palma.

the worst night

That was Stanley Tarsus.

21:37.468 --> 21:38.767
Him? He was...

21:38.800 --> 21:40.468
Oh-ho! Bobby did it.
Bobby did it.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.633
It really worked.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.267
I never thought
it would,

21:43.301 --> 21:45.468
'cause it was
the craziest stunt

21:45.500 --> 21:46.633

of it.

21:48.001 --> 21:50.301

thought of it.

21:50.334 --> 21:53.134
Well, I didn't
think of it.

I love you
for admitting

21:55.500 --> 21:57.867
that you didn't
think of it.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.867
I can't lose tonight.

21:59.900 --> 22:01.800
Let's dance close

22:01.834 --> 22:03.834
and pretend not
to notice.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.767
Not bad.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.334
LOUIE:
Not bad at all.

22:11.368 --> 22:16.600
All these mo-mos trying
to learn how to do my steps,

22:16.633 --> 22:19.834
wishing they were
with my girl.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.167
I feel real good.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.334
And yet...

22:28.368 --> 22:29.834
No, no, no.

22:29.867 --> 22:31.633
Anything you say
beyond that

22:31.667 --> 22:34.434
has to fall in the category
of pushing it, Louie.

22:34.468 --> 22:36.834
I just want to touch
Sheila's hair.

22:36.867 --> 22:40.500
I've always wanted to do that
ever since high school.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.234
Don't do it, Louie.

22:42.267 --> 22:44.900
Why not?

22:44.934 --> 22:47.134
What harm could it do?

22:47.167 --> 22:48.967
Come on.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.234
( <i>chuckling</i> )

22:50.267 --> 22:51.967
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

22:52.001 --> 22:53.101
Go ahead.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.767
( <i>screaming</i> )

23:12.567 --> 23:13.700
Oh!

23:13.734 --> 23:15.067
Whoa! Whoa!

23:18.401 --> 23:20.401
( <i>crowd screaming</i> )

23:33.900 --> 23:36.900
( <i>balloons popping</i> )

23:40.368 --> 23:43.334
I don't know about anybody else,

23:43.368 --> 23:46.401
but I'm really enjoying myself!

23:46.434 --> 23:49.368
LOUIE:
Thank you!

23:51.201 --> 23:53.201
Oh, thank you.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.368
Oh, see you!

24:32.267 --> 24:34.134
Night, Mr. Walters.

24:34.167 --> 24:35.167
Mmm.
