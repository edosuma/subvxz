00:03.280 --> 00:05.610
You aren't concerned about
the feds looking into you?

00:05.640 --> 00:07.020
The bureau's putting together a case.

00:07.060 --> 00:09.370
We'll use you to monitor
it from the inside.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.650
Patty thinks the UNR merger is
about an energy trading scheme.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.690
UNR is using their power to
manipulate energy prices for profit.

00:16.710 --> 00:19.130
You told me I could use the
firm to go after Frobisher.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.130
My resources are your resources.

00:21.170 --> 00:25.380
For the past decade, Frobisher has had
a high-end security firm on retainer.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.190
Calder Protective Services.

00:27.220 --> 00:31.610
If Parsons traces this back to either
of us, there will be consequences.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.100
Aracite is toxic.

00:33.110 --> 00:34.740
The final report said that it was safe.

00:34.780 --> 00:36.560
Kendrick had the report doctored.

00:36.590 --> 00:40.140
I gave half of my life to
this man and his company.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.660
Turns out he's a criminal.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.440
Do we have an energy secretary yet?

00:43.470 --> 00:44.510
Phil Grey.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.390
Patty Hewes's husband?

00:46.730 --> 00:49.050
We've only got one night in London.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.760
How about this girlfriend of yours?

00:52.790 --> 00:55.640
Michael's told me so much about you.
I'm so glad we could finally meet.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.690
Are you alone?
We need to meet.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.460
Who was on the goddamn phone?

00:59.490 --> 01:01.490
I don't know his name.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.360
You killed him, didn't you?

01:05.400 --> 01:07.750
He made a call to the deputy
director of the bureau.

01:07.780 --> 01:09.160
Is my supervisor in on this?

01:09.210 --> 01:13.340
Of course, he is.
Now, get me Patty Hewes.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.910
This happened last night?

01:22.680 --> 01:24.400
Who found him?

01:24.430 --> 01:28.070
Agents Werner and Harrison were
sharing a domicile at the time.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.820
I was staying with him.

01:31.170 --> 01:33.490
Since my wife and I split.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.280
Did you know that he had a problem?

01:35.310 --> 01:38.860
No, and he never let it affect his work.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.640
Didn't he have to take drug tests?

01:44.650 --> 01:47.420
Yeah, but there's ways
of getting around that.

01:48.160 --> 01:52.010
Agent Harrison loved his job, but...

01:52.550 --> 01:54.970
we all have demons.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.310
I guess that's how he dealt with his.

02:01.650 --> 02:05.150
This... this happens
in the middle of a case.

02:06.740 --> 02:08.800
Aren't you suspicious?

02:08.820 --> 02:12.370
Of course. And we've investigated it.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.520
There's no evidence of homicide.

02:15.530 --> 02:18.080
Your cover is still intact, Ellen.

02:18.090 --> 02:21.090
We can still go after Patty Hewes.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.900
Oh, it's okay.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.780
I lied, too.

S02E11:
London, Of Course!

03:59.320 --> 04:01.630
Yeah, that's right.

04:06.110 --> 04:08.280
Phil.

04:09.410 --> 04:13.070
Ellen. How lovely to see you.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.290
You have a meeting here, too?

04:15.320 --> 04:18.529
No, the Sullivan Grand
is my home these days.

04:19.029 --> 04:22.740
Congratulations. Patty told us you're
first choice for energy secretary.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.930
Fingers crossed.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.310
- Great running into you.
- Yeah.

04:31.010 --> 04:34.800
- Tell Patty I said hi.
- Will do.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.090
Patty's husband is having an affair.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.120
Interesting.

04:46.150 --> 04:48.780
I don't know what to do.
Should I tell her?

04:49.610 --> 04:50.870
Well, let's think about that.

04:50.900 --> 04:55.550
If I told her, I could prove my
loyalty, help secure her trust.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.320
Or she could shoot you
for being the messenger.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.310
Especially if she already knows
that he cheats and she lets him.

05:01.320 --> 05:05.140
You're right. She won't
want that thrown in her face.

05:05.150 --> 05:10.710
If you don't know Patty's response, smart move
is to keep the information in your back pocket.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.240
- So, do nothing?
- Yeah.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.800
For now.

05:20.180 --> 05:24.760
And to think my granddad never
even learned how to write.

05:25.230 --> 05:29.680
I'm sure he'd be very proud to
have a library named after him.

05:29.690 --> 05:33.700
God, I hated books as
a kid. Reading out loud.

05:33.990 --> 05:37.790
You've told me. With your stammer.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.740
My father humiliated
me every chance he got.

05:41.750 --> 05:44.610
Well, you've certainly come a long way.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.350
I don't know why I'm getting all...

05:56.090 --> 05:58.020
am I done here?

05:58.030 --> 06:02.700
Yes. It looks official. Congratulations.

06:05.210 --> 06:07.600
Did you have an okay
time with your father?

06:08.690 --> 06:10.990
He is who he is.

06:13.150 --> 06:15.860
Before I go, I'd like to apologize.

06:16.270 --> 06:17.510
What for?

06:17.540 --> 06:19.990
Questioning you the other day.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.910
I only asked about your business
plans so I could protect you.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.960
I overreacted, Claire. I'm sorry.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.500
I don't doubt your leadership of UNR.

06:31.010 --> 06:33.630
I know that.

06:37.610 --> 06:42.090
Patty's agreed to a personal
profile in new york style magazine.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.710
Patty and Phil as manhattan's
premier power couple.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.220
- Really?
- Yeah, so be prepared.

06:49.230 --> 06:51.450
The reporter may want to interview you.

06:51.850 --> 06:55.460
- Why?
- Well, she's granted them full access.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.450
This is the first personal interview
Patty's given in over a decade.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.490
They will be fishing.

07:06.280 --> 07:10.660
Whatever you say about Patty will
live in print forever, so remember:

07:10.670 --> 07:16.580
She's a saint; her marriage is perfect;
she's the best damn boss you've ever had.

07:16.590 --> 07:18.640
Got it.

07:21.350 --> 07:26.170
Steering away from Patty and Phil
for a moment, let's talk about you.

07:28.580 --> 07:30.020
I understand your wife's pregnant.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.840
She is, she is. A boy.

07:32.710 --> 07:35.660
So, how is it possible
to balance the pressures

07:35.661 --> 07:38.610
of a family with a
high-stress job like this?

07:38.620 --> 07:41.580
My wife and I had our
first child the year

07:41.581 --> 07:44.540
I started to work for Patty--
With Patty--

07:45.200 --> 07:47.590
and I don't think she
understood... I don't...

07:47.600 --> 07:53.600
i don't think I understood the sacrifice that
it took and the commitment that was needed.

07:53.610 --> 07:56.800
- To a child.
- To the job.

07:57.950 --> 08:00.690
I mean, and yeah, and to
the child. Yeah, of course.

08:00.700 --> 08:05.780
But... but Patty...
the equanimity, the...

08:05.790 --> 08:09.190
the grace with which
she handles everything.

08:09.220 --> 08:12.435
I mean, to be able to
build a law firm like

08:12.436 --> 08:15.650
this and to raise her
son at the same time...

08:15.660 --> 08:19.490
it's, uh... it's extraordinary.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.650
Does Patty have any flaws?

08:25.490 --> 08:27.490
Off the record?

08:30.640 --> 08:33.100
Okay.

08:33.690 --> 08:35.940
Not a one.

08:36.880 --> 08:41.179
Be sure it just doesn't get too
flat on top. I like it to be just...

08:44.020 --> 08:45.670
Patty.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.660
Hi, Ellen.

08:47.670 --> 08:49.710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.250
So, I just needed your
signature on these.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.740
Think I look too orange?

08:56.750 --> 09:00.630
No, you look just the
perfect shade of orange.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.790
They're almost ready.

09:01.820 --> 09:03.260
Sorry this is taking so long.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.640
Do I have time for a cup of coffee?

09:04.680 --> 09:06.950
Oh, of course.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.680
Ellen Parsons, Carla Stenson.
She's writing the piece.

09:10.690 --> 09:12.670
Pleased to meet you.

09:12.690 --> 09:15.290
We're doing the profile
on Ms. Hewes and Mr. Grey.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.420
On Phil and Patty.

09:17.450 --> 09:20.480
I'd love to include you in the article,
if it's all right with Ms. Hewes.

09:20.490 --> 09:22.960
Oh, that'd be fine. Ellen would
be a great person to talk to.

09:22.970 --> 09:25.490
She knows all my secrets.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.320
- I'm back.
- Oh, good.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.060
- Looks like they're ready.
- Where do you want us?

09:30.070 --> 09:34.330
Oh, just casual, on the couch.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.960
All right, right in the middle here?

09:39.220 --> 09:42.600
Now, you ask Phil all
the tough questions.

09:42.610 --> 09:45.160
Okay.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.730
It's hard to be casual.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.240
Is this good? Are we doing okay?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.980
Hey, you.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.130
Why did you shut down my
investigation of Arthur Frobisher?

10:08.140 --> 10:10.740
I'm sorry. Did someone
invite you into my office?

10:10.750 --> 10:11.960
I've been calling your investigator.

10:11.990 --> 10:13.870
He's refusing to look
into Calder Security.

10:13.890 --> 10:15.970
I told him not to.

10:15.980 --> 10:16.980
Why?

10:17.020 --> 10:18.900
We're under federal investigation.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.790
I don't want anyone shining
a light on the Frobisher case.

10:21.810 --> 10:25.280
We've connected Frobisher to
Calder Security. We have a lead now.

10:25.290 --> 10:28.180
If we wait, he's just
going to cover his tracks.

10:30.370 --> 10:34.820
We're at war with UNR, and
the feds are targeting me.

10:35.210 --> 10:41.290
These are my priorities, and if
you have a problem with that, quit.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.890
I ran a background
check on you, Mr. Wilcox.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.640
You were in the marines.

10:54.650 --> 10:56.170
Military didn't work out.

10:56.210 --> 10:58.660
Conformity was a problem for me.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.870
That's why I became a
private investigator.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.230
I work for myself now.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.790
Have you ever worked for Patty Hewes?

11:05.430 --> 11:07.240
I choose my clients carefully.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.930
- Is that a yes or a no?
- That's a definite no.

11:16.340 --> 11:19.280
People your age usually
don't hire people like me.

11:19.290 --> 11:20.990
Is that a problem?

11:21.020 --> 11:24.060
You work for one of the most
powerful law firms in the country.

11:24.370 --> 11:28.310
You must have resources,
so... why do you need me?

11:31.010 --> 11:33.390
It's a private matter.

11:34.050 --> 11:36.710
My fiance was murdered.

11:37.390 --> 11:40.320
I know who did it. I
just can't prove it.

11:40.730 --> 11:44.530
Well... I'd love to help you out.

11:47.630 --> 11:51.160
This migraine is parked
right behind my left eye.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.220
It's stress.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.720
Mankind isn't supposed
to live in cities.

11:58.650 --> 12:01.360
Throws our serotonin out of whack.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.280
This is all Walter Kendrick.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.420
Forget about him.

12:08.430 --> 12:13.360
He's been using me, using me

12:13.370 --> 12:16.780
to cover up his criminal activity
for I don't know how many years.

12:16.790 --> 12:20.930
If you want to be done with him, the
only thing for you to do is resign.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.030
I gave the company 20 years.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.060
How do I just throw it all away?

12:27.110 --> 12:29.660
Maybe it's time for a change.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.790
What if you and I try to find
out what's really here between us?

12:37.300 --> 12:42.810
Danny, I can't just sit around and
let Kendrick get away with all this.

12:44.630 --> 12:49.220
you yourself said our company is still
poisoning people in West Virginia.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.380
That's my problem. Listen to me.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.500
You can't change UNR.

12:58.020 --> 13:04.780
Maybe I can, if I oust Kendrick
and run the company myself.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.090
What I want doesn't matter anyway.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.250
Why not?

13:12.280 --> 13:16.700
The board just brought in Mitch
McCullen. He's next in line.

13:17.220 --> 13:19.740
And he's ambitious.

13:20.430 --> 13:25.650
You better bet that if there's an opening,
Mitch McCullen is going to grab it.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.870
It says something when a man
chooses to sit in his boss' seat.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.330
What does it say?

13:45.380 --> 13:48.140
Maybe he's not too
happy with his own job.

13:48.150 --> 13:50.560
I love my job.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.540
I think you'll find this useful.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.020
Thank you.

14:01.430 --> 14:02.880
Do you have more coordinates?

14:02.920 --> 14:06.970
No, we're through with that.
Get rid of the car.

14:06.980 --> 14:10.590
Chop it up. Dump it in the east river.
Just make it disappear.

14:11.890 --> 14:14.450
Not a problem.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.630
- Yeah?
- It's Malcolm.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.070
What is it?

14:36.730 --> 14:39.730
It's been days, no sign of finn garrety.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.770
- Has anyone else approached the car?
- No.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.860
Okay, it's been long
enough. You know what to do.

14:51.610 --> 14:55.820
Did I mention...
I ran into Ellen Parsons?

14:57.750 --> 14:59.570
I had a meeting
at the Sullivan Grand.

14:59.580 --> 15:01.720
That's nice.

15:06.150 --> 15:08.530
And how are you this fine morning?

15:08.900 --> 15:11.580
I think I need coffee
before I answer that.

15:11.590 --> 15:13.630
Phil mentioned he ran into you.

15:15.390 --> 15:18.990
Yeah, at my hotel.
He said he had a meeting.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.620
He seems very excited about
his bid for energy secretary.

15:23.960 --> 15:24.950
It always amazes me.

15:24.990 --> 15:28.980
In a city this size, you still
manage to run into people you know.

15:29.770 --> 15:31.780
Patty.

15:32.410 --> 15:35.020
I want to apologize for
pushing you to pursue

15:35.021 --> 15:37.630
Frobisher's connection
to Calder Security.

15:37.640 --> 15:42.120
I, uh... I got emotional.
I crossed a line.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.930
We've talked about your temper, Ellen.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.600
It's a shame that you
still can't control it.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.100
I said I'm sorry.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.410
I heard you the first time.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.290
Hey, Mitch.
Thanks for meeting me.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.610
It sounded urgent.
What's wrong?

16:10.060 --> 16:13.850
It feels like a betrayal
to even talk to you.

16:14.530 --> 16:17.220
A betrayal to who?

16:19.490 --> 16:24.460
I've been a believer in Walter
Kendrick for almost 20 years.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.440
Everyone knows that.

16:29.620 --> 16:32.890
I know the board hasn't
been happy since the merger.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.930
What do you expect? We're facing
a multimillion-dollar lawsuit

16:37.940 --> 16:40.170
that could have catastrophic
long-term effects.

16:40.210 --> 16:44.580
Walter assured me that it's only a matter of
months before he turns that situation around, but...

16:46.330 --> 16:48.530
I don't think it's going to happen.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.100
Why not?

16:52.120 --> 16:57.460
Because he's going to lose the
shareholder suit against Patty Hewes.

16:57.470 --> 17:02.150
He's already authorized
a $50 million settlement.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.730
She turned it down.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.339
You know, I'd lay down my
life for Walter Kendrick,

17:09.349 --> 17:12.260
but he's in over his
head with this merger.

17:12.270 --> 17:16.000
I don't want to see him
drive the company off a cliff.

17:17.910 --> 17:20.109
You think it's that bad?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.500
You're next in line, Mitch.

17:27.290 --> 17:30.100
You could right the ship.

17:32.460 --> 17:34.720
I'd need your support.

17:34.730 --> 17:37.120
The executive committee trusts you.

17:37.620 --> 17:41.240
If you can get the board to
vote in a change of leadership...

17:42.150 --> 17:44.850
I won't stand in your way.

17:44.860 --> 17:47.470
I'll talk to my allies
on the committee...

17:48.250 --> 17:51.130
see if I can line up the votes.

17:51.140 --> 17:55.910
Mitch, you can't let Walter
know you're making this move.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.530
He won't.

18:01.070 --> 18:03.790
I'll be discreet.

18:07.730 --> 18:10.300
I had drinks with Mitch McCullen.

18:10.730 --> 18:12.690
You finally decided
to give him a chance?

18:12.730 --> 18:14.410
He wasn't interested in romance, Walt.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.020
- No?
- No.

18:16.030 --> 18:18.350
He wanted to talk about you.

18:18.900 --> 18:21.570
You're right. That doesn't
sound very romantic.

18:23.510 --> 18:27.920
He told me the board is
unhappy with your performance.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.550
He said they've lost confidence in you.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.980
The next earnings statement
will bring them around.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.930
I don't think they're
going to wait that long.

18:37.970 --> 18:43.520
Mitch is angling to oust
you and take over as CEO.

18:44.880 --> 18:45.660
He said that?

18:45.690 --> 18:49.380
Not in so many words, but I
could read between the lines.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.430
- I think he's testing me.
- What for?

18:52.910 --> 18:55.370
To see if I'll back
him if he makes a move.

18:55.380 --> 18:58.270
- What'd you say?
- I said I would.

18:58.280 --> 19:01.350
I figured it was best to let
him think I was on his side.

19:01.750 --> 19:05.640
Good. That was the right play.

19:05.650 --> 19:11.130
But Walt, I don't think he would
have been bold enough to approach me

19:11.360 --> 19:14.720
if he didn't already have
enough votes to get rid of you.

19:17.050 --> 19:20.890
Well... thanks, Claire.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.970
You need to meet this head-on. Now.

19:31.390 --> 19:34.620
I got a problem. There's a
loose end I'm worried about.

19:37.040 --> 19:38.560
Yeah?

19:38.570 --> 19:41.430
I may need to take
matters into my own hands.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.670
- This loose end: male or female?
- Female.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.590
What's your connection to her?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.930
She's fallout from the Frobisher case.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.340
Jesus!

19:53.350 --> 19:56.840
Guy's not even a client anymore,
he's still a pain in the ass.

19:57.260 --> 20:01.770
If I take care of this
thoroughly, things could escalate,

20:02.480 --> 20:08.480
but if I leave her alone, there are ways that
she can trace her fianc? s death back to me.

20:09.230 --> 20:11.790
Well, that's a hell of a dilemma, Rick.

20:12.280 --> 20:17.190
But as far as Calder Security
is concerned, you don't exist.

20:17.610 --> 20:22.440
So, clean up your own goddamn mess.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.410
Calder Security.
I did some preliminary digging.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.650
Word is they have extensive black ops.

20:32.670 --> 20:34.870
Former military, ex-law enforcement.

20:34.940 --> 20:38.050
The cop that went missing--
he was still on the force.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.700
I'm not surprised.

20:39.750 --> 20:42.750
Connections in the police department
would be very valuable to Calder.

20:42.770 --> 20:46.010
But I doubt that they would
rely on just a beat cop.

20:46.020 --> 20:46.930
What do you mean?

20:46.950 --> 20:50.530
I'm sure there's someone higher up
in the force who reports to them.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.540
Can you find out who that is?

20:52.550 --> 20:55.420
Yeah, it'll be tough.
There won't be a paper trail.

20:55.430 --> 20:57.940
And if these are the men
who murdered your fianc?

20:57.960 --> 21:00.900
you can be sure there won't
be any links to Frobisher.

21:01.720 --> 21:06.980
But the first step would be to
prove these rogue operatives exist,

21:06.990 --> 21:09.480
and then find out who they are.

21:10.230 --> 21:13.530
- What would it take to do that?
- Money.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.840
You can use everything I have.

21:18.460 --> 21:20.430
Then I'll get started.

21:20.810 --> 21:24.960
Oh, about that other thing--
you were right.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.650
I'll be in touch.

21:37.690 --> 21:40.180
Morning.

21:50.350 --> 21:51.980
Yeah?

21:51.990 --> 21:53.450
You're asking for me?

21:53.460 --> 21:55.280
Oh, yeah.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.910
The reporter would love to
interview you about me and Phil.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.400
It would be my pleasure.

22:02.440 --> 22:06.100
- I was wondering, though.
- Yeah?

22:07.680 --> 22:10.770
How do you and Phil make it work?

22:10.780 --> 22:12.950
Come in.

22:15.300 --> 22:19.470
Oh, this new mail guy is driving
me crazy. I said, come in!

22:19.480 --> 22:21.400
You're never gonna replace uncle pete.

22:21.410 --> 22:23.810
Sorry, Ms. Hewes.
Is this a bad time?

22:23.820 --> 22:26.060
Give it to me.

22:31.980 --> 22:34.510
So, you were asking about marriage.

22:34.520 --> 22:39.760
Well, you know, it's funny because everyone
will tell you it's about trust, commitment.

22:39.770 --> 22:44.020
- It isn't?
- No, that's exactly what it is.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.180
Trust, commitment.

22:47.430 --> 22:50.880
I mean, some things in
this life are simple.

22:51.690 --> 22:55.380
Yeah, well, I guess that's comforting.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.100
What is it?

23:11.140 --> 23:13.400
It's nothing.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.610
Is everything okay?

23:22.890 --> 23:24.940
Yes. Fine.

23:24.950 --> 23:27.320
I have to get back to work now.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.690
Okay. Of course.

23:44.230 --> 23:47.360
So, as a young woman
working for Patty, you must

23:47.361 --> 23:50.490
have an interesting
perspective on her marriage.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.480
Patty's very private
about her personal life.

23:53.490 --> 23:58.900
Well, the people I've interviewed have spoken
in such glowing terms about Phil and Patty,

23:59.160 --> 24:02.410
at a certain point, you have to
wonder if it's too good to be true.

24:02.420 --> 24:05.680
You know, Carla, I see Patty
every day, and I can tell you,

24:05.720 --> 24:09.370
she and Phil are absolutely
devoted to each other.

24:09.380 --> 24:14.790
And working for Patty has taught me
something about being a woman, you know?

24:14.800 --> 24:19.330
A professional woman. Seeing how she
balances work and her personal life.

24:19.340 --> 24:22.860
What she prioritizes,
how she prioritizes.

24:23.590 --> 24:26.520
She's nothing less than
an inspiration to me.

24:30.170 --> 24:32.300
You want to take me down, asshole?

24:33.170 --> 24:34.620
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

24:34.650 --> 24:36.760
Don't give me that horseshit.

24:36.780 --> 24:39.780
You think you're the only one with
friends on the executive committee?

24:40.670 --> 24:43.650
You may have friends,
but I have the numbers.

24:44.240 --> 24:48.030
- You won't survive the next vote.
- There won't be a vote.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.620
It's my company.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.920
Don't think for one goddamn
second you can take it from me.

24:58.700 --> 25:03.160
I'm sure the sec would be interested to
know exactly how you made your first million.

25:08.910 --> 25:14.280
Go ahead. But you take me
down, you're going down, too.

25:14.600 --> 25:18.560
I'm willing to lose everything. Are you?

25:43.280 --> 25:45.450
There's a problem.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.520
The car is gone.

25:47.530 --> 25:50.260
- Anything useful?
- No structural modifications.

25:50.270 --> 25:52.930
Nothing's been tampered
with or concealed inside.

25:52.940 --> 25:55.640
Only 51 miles on the odometer.

25:55.650 --> 25:57.780
This baby's good as new.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.600
Vehicle's completely clean?

25:59.630 --> 26:02.460
There's one thing, though,
that doesn't make sense.

26:02.470 --> 26:07.150
For a car with such little mileage on it, someone
sure has been using the navigation system a lot.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.730
Someone punched in a bunch
of numbers into the gps.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.950
- Locations?
- No. It's bizarre.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.770
They just used latitudes. No longitudes.

26:16.780 --> 26:22.330
Could they be transferring information
to the energy trader using the gps?

26:22.880 --> 26:24.640
Could you get us a record
of all the coordinates?

26:24.650 --> 26:27.460
I think so. It might take a while to
thoroughly hack the system's history.

26:27.470 --> 26:30.200
Do it, Carl.

26:39.070 --> 26:42.340
- I'm sorry, Claire.
- What do you mean?

26:42.350 --> 26:45.450
I can't do it. I can't make
a move against Kendrick.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.720
Why not?

26:49.480 --> 26:52.580
He... he came to me. He, um...

26:53.070 --> 26:55.750
he knows things.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.150
I can't be in his crosshairs right now.

26:58.180 --> 27:01.210
- He's strong-arming
you. - Well, it worked.

27:02.350 --> 27:04.640
I don't have a choice.

27:05.200 --> 27:11.300
As far as I'm concerned, we can't get rid of this
bastard fast enough, but I'm out of the running.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.440
I understand.

27:15.730 --> 27:18.110
Why don't you do it?

27:19.800 --> 27:22.210
I'm not interested.

27:22.220 --> 27:25.510
The board knows your
loyalty and your commitment.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.310
And Kendrick will never see it coming.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.330
That's true.

27:30.340 --> 27:33.770
Could you even mobilize
the board on my behalf?

27:33.780 --> 27:36.680
The votes are already
lined up to make a move.

27:37.220 --> 27:42.160
If you want this, Claire,
it's yours. Say the word.

27:46.010 --> 27:48.480
Her name is Anna Mercado.

27:48.490 --> 27:51.410
Born in brussels to
an American diplomat.

27:51.420 --> 27:55.420
She's a senior financial analyst
with the London branch of Phil's firm.

27:55.790 --> 27:58.580
London. Of course.

27:58.590 --> 28:01.510
Well, she travels to new
york at least once a month.

28:04.460 --> 28:06.290
What's this?

28:06.710 --> 28:09.490
I've started to track
down Phil's financials.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.040
- Does he give her money?
- No.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.260
Not that I've found.

28:17.500 --> 28:21.470
These photos are just copies. Someone
has the originals. If these get out...

28:21.480 --> 28:24.500
You really don't have
to explain the situation.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.630
This usually means blackmail.

28:29.910 --> 28:32.610
I expect you'll receive
a call or a letter.

28:35.590 --> 28:39.490
Whoever sent these to you
wanted to hurt you. Badly.

28:40.590 --> 28:43.710
Any idea who that could be?

28:53.040 --> 28:55.170
Your mom came to see me.

28:56.140 --> 28:58.220
What she want?

28:58.230 --> 29:00.040
Don't get all dark.

29:00.090 --> 29:03.550
You know, she's just a little
preoccupied with abandonment issues.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.510
My mom said that?

29:06.520 --> 29:10.100
No, not in those words, but
I mean, it's pretty clear.

29:10.110 --> 29:14.650
She's worried about losing you to me;
she's worried about losing you to college.

29:14.960 --> 29:17.890
Well, she doesn't have
to worry about college.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.870
Why not?

29:20.880 --> 29:22.860
I never applied.

29:25.260 --> 29:28.300
I mean, the allure of an
older woman is undeniable.

29:28.800 --> 29:33.050
In junior high school, I was always more
attracted to my older sister's friends.

29:33.060 --> 29:35.780
It has nothing to do
with Jill's age.

29:35.790 --> 29:38.480
Her energy is incredibly attractive.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.150
She lives in the moment.

29:40.190 --> 29:43.980
I understand. We just don't
want to see you get hurt.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.710
Thank you, but I can handle it.

29:47.730 --> 29:51.220
Well, anyway, you'll be
going off to college soon.

29:52.350 --> 29:55.075
The most important thing
is that you're honest

29:55.076 --> 29:57.800
with her, that you
treat her with respect.

29:57.810 --> 30:00.120
Thanks, Phil. I will.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.680
I haven't felt like this in years.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.810
The board actually wants you
to be there when they fire him?

30:12.500 --> 30:15.860
I asked to be there. They agreed.

30:15.870 --> 30:18.500
If I'm going to do
this, I owe it to him.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.190
I want to look him in the eye.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.460
Well, you've won, Claire.

30:22.470 --> 30:27.050
And when you're in charge, get ready for people
to come out of the woodwork with their own agendas.

30:27.060 --> 30:30.700
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Starting with me.

30:31.410 --> 30:34.650
I have a responsibility
to deal with aracite.

30:36.270 --> 30:41.010
I want you to oversee the
clean-up... if you're open to it.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.310
Thank you.

30:44.980 --> 30:48.380
New day. New chapter.

30:57.630 --> 31:00.050
Miss Maddox, this way.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.740
Claire. Good to see you.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.660
Where is everyone?

31:15.190 --> 31:19.350
You know, I picked the
wood for this table.

31:19.860 --> 31:22.360
It's American cherry.

31:22.390 --> 31:24.360
Grows near the bituminous coal fields

31:24.361 --> 31:26.330
of Pennsylvania.
You know why I chose it?

31:26.340 --> 31:29.060
I'm not here for a
carpentry lesson, Walt.

31:29.070 --> 31:31.930
I picked it because it bends well.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.830
But it's strong.

31:35.340 --> 31:38.200
And it takes an excellent polish.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.980
Not like some of the other
common American timbers.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.530
Like pine for instance.

31:46.560 --> 31:49.770
Pine is soft and weak.

31:50.210 --> 31:53.390
But it's especially good for trim.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.510
Cut the shit.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.530
You really think you have what it
takes to sit at the head of my table?

31:58.570 --> 32:01.790
You know I do. Where
is the goddamn board?

32:03.060 --> 32:06.340
If you had concerns about my
stewardship, you should have come to me.

32:06.350 --> 32:08.680
You lied to me.

32:08.700 --> 32:12.090
I know about aracite.
I know about the merger.

32:12.310 --> 32:16.300
I know you've been fixing energy
prices with forced brownouts.

32:17.030 --> 32:18.940
So you can't stop me.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.970
The board will find
out who you really are.

32:21.020 --> 32:22.890
And when they do, they'll prosecute you.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.440
All this plotting and betrayal
isn't in your nature, Claire.

32:26.450 --> 32:28.790
Must have kept you up nights.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.810
Except those nights when
you were sleeping around.

32:33.530 --> 32:35.460
It's over, Claire.

32:35.490 --> 32:40.550
An hour ago, the board
voted to let you go.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.520
On what grounds?

32:44.550 --> 32:48.970
On the grounds you had sexual
relations with Daniel Purcell.

32:49.450 --> 32:51.900
You can't be serious.

32:51.910 --> 32:54.220
It's a simple legal issue, really.

32:54.250 --> 32:59.850
You engaged in an improper
relationship with a UNR contractor.

32:59.860 --> 33:02.680
That's a violation of
our code of conduct.

33:02.730 --> 33:06.140
But then, as former lead
counsel, you would know.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.220
You wrote the damn thing.

33:08.270 --> 33:11.490
Don't you dare talk
legal ethics with me.

33:11.540 --> 33:13.720
Have to say, it didn't
help that Mr. Purcell

33:13.721 --> 33:15.900
was a married man
whose wife was murdered.

33:16.890 --> 33:20.870
The board tends to shy away
from that sort of scandal.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.470
So did Daniel Purcell tell
you I was screwing him?

33:24.480 --> 33:28.240
No. Mr. Purcell really
seems to like you.

33:28.980 --> 33:30.250
Go to hell.

33:30.290 --> 33:32.640
I probably will.

33:33.530 --> 33:36.205
But while I'm here,
no one is going

33:36.206 --> 33:38.880
to take away my goddamn company!

33:40.760 --> 33:44.560
Go home. I sent you a present.

34:39.110 --> 34:42.290
I want you to destroy
the son of a bitch.

34:42.510 --> 34:46.750
Everything you're
accusing him of is true.

34:47.350 --> 34:50.190
Of course, I can't help you.
What I know is privileged.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.929
It can't be used in court.

34:51.969 --> 34:54.480
But I can offer you some insight.

34:54.489 --> 34:56.420
What's that?

34:56.440 --> 35:00.760
Walter is deeply connected.
He plays dirty.

35:01.310 --> 35:05.130
And it is going to take
someone like you to stop him.

35:06.720 --> 35:09.280
I've watched your career
over the years, Patty, and

35:09.281 --> 35:11.840
I don't like the way you
do business, but I get it.

35:11.850 --> 35:15.340
I get that it's necessary.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.660
There's one more thing you need to know.

35:21.530 --> 35:25.340
- It's about Daniel Purcell.
- Yes?

35:25.690 --> 35:28.810
I was as surprised as you
when he flipped on the stand.

35:30.500 --> 35:33.300
But you can trust him now.

35:33.850 --> 35:37.200
He wants to set things right.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.080
Thanks for the drink.

35:41.090 --> 35:43.880
Thanks for the advice.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.620
You were right. I'm
done relying on Patty.

35:55.630 --> 35:57.910
I've hired my own investigator.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.540
Should have done it a long time ago.

36:03.050 --> 36:04.950
It's Tom.

36:05.500 --> 36:09.440
- What's up?
- Turn on the news.

36:13.950 --> 36:16.590
Patty Hewes may be heading
to court again soon,

36:16.591 --> 36:19.230
and her opponent this
time may be her husband,

36:19.250 --> 36:21.620
energy secretary nominee Phil Grey.

36:21.650 --> 36:25.290
Mr. Grey's recent nomination catapulted
him into the national spotlight,

36:25.330 --> 36:27.930
and he seemed a shoo-in
for the cabinet...

36:27.940 --> 36:30.780
But that was before he was
caught in a compromising

36:30.781 --> 36:33.620
series of pictures with a
London trader, Anna Mercado.

36:33.630 --> 36:38.330
Now, Mr. Grey has been forced to
withdraw his name... from consideration.

36:40.070 --> 36:42.040
I thought you weren't
going to tell anyone.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.440
I didn't.

36:44.450 --> 36:47.620
- Ellen, did you leak those photos to the press?
- No.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.320
Patty must have.

37:05.990 --> 37:09.220
- Patty?
- I'm up here.

37:26.780 --> 37:29.620
I've been, uh, cleaning out my closet.

37:31.130 --> 37:33.920
Just take whatever you want.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.530
Thanks.

37:36.570 --> 37:39.010
Oh, actually...

37:39.020 --> 37:41.620
it's really not your style.

37:41.660 --> 37:45.280
I'll just give it all to goodwill.

37:47.470 --> 37:49.450
Okay.

37:58.470 --> 38:00.490
Are you here alone?

38:00.500 --> 38:06.640
Michael's with his geriatric
girlfriend, and Phil's at a hotel.

38:08.310 --> 38:13.350
I'm sorry. Must have
been an awful shock.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.840
It wasn't the affair.

38:17.870 --> 38:22.620
It was that he... got sloppy.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.000
Let himself get caught.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.240
That bothers me.

38:39.630 --> 38:42.010
I don't...

38:42.810 --> 38:46.070
I can't figure out
whether I should thank you.

38:46.910 --> 38:49.060
For what?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.600
Sending me the pictures.

38:55.990 --> 38:59.520
You could have been
trying to protect me.

39:00.470 --> 39:04.440
Let me know before the... world knew.

39:06.180 --> 39:10.890
Or maybe you were just being vindictive.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.920
I think you're angry.

39:20.360 --> 39:25.330
I'm sorry that I didn't
let you pursue Frobisher.

39:26.360 --> 39:30.370
This isn't personal, Ellen.

39:32.800 --> 39:37.460
You've got to let things
just roll off your back.

39:39.950 --> 39:43.300
Why did you leak the
pictures to the press?

39:45.440 --> 39:48.060
That's my business.

39:48.650 --> 39:52.190
It's not that easy to let
things roll off your back, is it?

39:57.050 --> 39:59.750
Why am I here?

40:00.780 --> 40:03.560
I wanted you to know.

40:06.060 --> 40:08.330
Know what?

40:08.930 --> 40:12.940
Things may be required of us.

40:12.950 --> 40:16.020
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

40:16.730 --> 40:19.390
This case...

40:23.430 --> 40:26.760
is going to get ugly.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.620
That's all.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.670
Close the door on your way out.

40:47.130 --> 40:49.010
Patty.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.790
Maybe we're both the vindictive type.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.080
My informant just shot Patty Hewes.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.640
- Ellen Parsons...
- What are you doing here?

41:13.650 --> 41:16.340
You're under arrest.
