(Clink)

00:11.011 --> 00:14.014
(Clinking)

00:36.807 --> 00:39.369
Thanks for the, uh,
ride to the library, mom.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.371
I know it was uncool of dad
to ask you to at the last minute.

00:41.372 --> 00:44.074
No, I was just
happy to get the call.

00:44.075 --> 00:46.076
If I ask you something,
could you just say "yes"

00:46.077 --> 00:48.318
without, you know,
making a big deal out it?

00:48.319 --> 00:50.320
I like how you just
assumed that I'd say yes.

00:50.321 --> 00:52.822
Well, we're doing a video
essay for social studies,

00:52.823 --> 00:54.824
and I'm supposed
to follow around

00:54.825 --> 00:57.227
one of my parents at
work, see what they do,

00:57.228 --> 01:01.391
and, uh, you know, how they contribute to
society and... and you chose me, not your dad?

01:01.392 --> 01:03.533
I chose yourjobover dad's.

01:03.534 --> 01:07.267
Dad's job is just boring. At
least yours has dead bodies.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.639
Actually, it's a lot more
complicated than that,

01:09.640 --> 01:12.642
and not really a place where
you can run around with a camera.

01:12.643 --> 01:14.774
You're saying no? No!
No, I'm not saying no,

01:14.775 --> 01:17.377
but it's important for you to
understand what we do there.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.709
It's import... exactly!
So I'll see you tomorrow.

01:19.710 --> 01:22.182
Uh... la... you're... Lacey...
(Laughs) Thanks, mom.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.853
Lace?

01:23.854 --> 01:25.485
(Cell phone rings)

01:25.486 --> 01:27.287

01:27.288 --> 01:29.119
Megan hunt, m.E.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.421
Where's bud?

01:31.422 --> 01:34.824
Bud's got court upstate.
I'm rolling solo on this one.

01:34.825 --> 01:38.598
Looks like a homeless man
found more than he bargained for.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.871
Glad you're here. Now
we can start digging.

01:43.774 --> 01:45.405
(Police radio chatter)

01:45.406 --> 01:47.407
(Megan) Wait, hold on.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.140
(Peter) What do you see?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.338
(Clears throat)

02:20.171 --> 02:22.812
It's gonna be a long day.

02:22.813 --> 02:24.544
Yes, it is.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.146
Okay, everybody, listen up.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.148
Our victim has been dismembered.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.451
We're gonna have to
excavate this entire area.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.583
(Man) All right.
Let's get to it.

02:33.584 --> 02:36.286
(Megan) All right, you're
gonna have to quadrant this off.

02:36.287 --> 02:38.288
(People speaking indistinctly)

02:38.289 --> 02:40.460
(Telephones ringing)

02:40.461 --> 02:42.932
Is that what I think it is?

02:42.933 --> 02:45.465
Mayor's office wants to know
if we have one body in pieces

02:45.466 --> 02:46.936
or multiple bodies

02:46.937 --> 02:48.938
and a serial
killer on the loose.

02:48.939 --> 02:51.170
I guess we'll find out together.

Let's run through
what we have so far.

03:38.749 --> 03:42.452
Only 5% of the
population is ab-positive.

03:42.453 --> 03:44.454
Both the hand and the foot

03:44.455 --> 03:46.656
exhibit signs of severe
rheumatoid arthritis.

03:46.657 --> 03:49.929
So we are dealing with
one victim, male, Caucasian,

03:49.930 --> 03:51.961
probably in his 50s.

03:51.962 --> 03:53.933
See these fractures?

03:53.934 --> 03:57.837
Something heavy dropped on
this man's foot a few years ago.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.969
All five metatarsals were
broken in a straight line.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.972
Everything below the line
crushed. Above it, unaffected.

04:02.973 --> 04:05.715
It's exactly the injury
you'd expect to see

04:05.716 --> 04:07.717
if he was wearing
steel-toed boots.

04:07.718 --> 04:11.020
That, and these spot scars
are consistent with metal spatter.

04:11.021 --> 04:13.953
He was a welder,
probably construction,

04:13.954 --> 04:16.556
until the arthritis
impaired him.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.558
Yeah, but how do
you get "sunglasses"

04:18.559 --> 04:20.490
from a hand and foot?

04:20.491 --> 04:22.792
Many longtime welders
develop arc burn.

04:22.793 --> 04:24.294
The ultraviolet radiation

04:24.295 --> 04:26.566
coming from the
electric arc welding

04:26.567 --> 04:29.839
can cause severe
sensitivity to light over time.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.042
Ergo, sunglasses.

04:33.043 --> 04:35.475
What is that?

04:35.476 --> 04:38.007
It's a stamp.

04:38.008 --> 04:41.511
Some kind of circle
with a... A paladin.

04:41.512 --> 04:44.584
It's from the winner's lounge
at the canyon creek casino.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.387
I play a mean game of hold'em.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.919
If our guy was there,
they've got tape on him.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.592
I know you don't want me to roll
up to the canyon creek and say,

04:52.593 --> 04:55.064
"I wanna see video footage
of a white man with a limp."

04:55.065 --> 04:56.926
And sunglasses. (Chuckles)

04:56.927 --> 04:59.999
Maybe I can help you. I
know the general manager.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.072
Like I said, mean
game of hold'em.

05:03.073 --> 05:05.074
(Man) Yeah, we use
that stamp for mondays.

05:05.075 --> 05:07.076
What you're seeing is

05:07.077 --> 05:11.481
everyone who came in and out
of the lounge this past Monday.

05:11.482 --> 05:13.312
There. Stop. That's him.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.915
(Chuckles) That's Cal.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.987
Cal got a last
name? Don't know it.

05:17.988 --> 05:19.989
He refuses to get
a players club card.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.452
He's a grinder, mostly
low-limit Blackjack,

05:22.453 --> 05:24.053
until last week.

05:24.054 --> 05:26.055
Got on one of those
once-in-a-lifetime streaks.

05:26.056 --> 05:28.658
By the time it was over,
cashed out over 25 grand.

05:28.659 --> 05:30.930
Wow. Yeah. Generous winner, too.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.632
Who's she?

05:32.633 --> 05:35.104
That's, uh, Wendy.

05:35.105 --> 05:38.908
Likes to chat up the
winners before they cash out.

05:38.909 --> 05:40.910
Talk about a fool and his money.

05:40.911 --> 05:43.843
Well, it's her
mission to part them.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.016
(Men speaking indistinctly)

05:47.017 --> 05:49.018
(Curtis) What is this?

05:49.019 --> 05:50.720
(Ethan) It could be pus

05:50.721 --> 05:52.622
from some kind of
bacterial infection.

05:52.623 --> 05:54.654
I don't see an
infection site. Well...

05:54.655 --> 05:56.656
Lacey's coming
to watch you work,

05:56.657 --> 05:58.928
and you drew up a schedule?
She'll be here in two hours.

05:58.929 --> 06:00.990
She's going to interview
each one of you.

06:00.991 --> 06:02.992
I've drawn up a
list of questions

06:02.993 --> 06:06.866
that I thought she might like to ask.
And did you draw up our answers, too?

06:06.867 --> 06:09.038
I'm not a complete
control freak. (Chuckles)

06:09.039 --> 06:12.041
Just be on your best behavior and hide the gory
stuff. That's kinda hard to do in a morgue.

06:12.042 --> 06:14.874
She will be confined to
the lab and the break room.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.377
Your job is to answer her
questions and make me look good.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.379
So you want us to lie?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.082
I don't see how this plan
could possibly fail, Megan.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.816
Hey, it looks like yogurt...

06:26.817 --> 06:29.789
With leaves in it.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.022
Show me that slide.

06:33.023 --> 06:35.695
Give me your finger.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.967
(Sniffing)

06:37.968 --> 06:39.529
Cilantro.

06:39.530 --> 06:43.032
There's a Greek restaurant
two blocks from the crime scene.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.875
Can I have my hand back now?

06:45.876 --> 06:48.508
Thanks.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.981
Yeah, I took him to the lounge.
He bought me champagne.

06:51.982 --> 06:53.983
He was a real gentleman. Why?

06:53.984 --> 06:55.985
He have a last name?

06:55.986 --> 06:57.847
It didn't come up.

06:57.848 --> 07:01.120
We have you on tape, Wendy.
Where'd you go after you left?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.923
Back to his place? Things
get a little too exciting?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.925
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.457
Cal's dead.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.459
You know anything,
now's the time.

07:09.460 --> 07:13.102
He wanted to leave before he
spent any more of his winnings.

07:13.103 --> 07:15.064
I tried to talk him back.

07:15.065 --> 07:17.567
Last I saw him, he was
gettin' in some guy's car.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.909
Some guy's car? It was dark.

07:19.910 --> 07:23.513
The car was dark.
Black. A sports car maybe.

07:23.514 --> 07:26.075
The guy, he had a
good grip on Cal's arm.

07:26.076 --> 07:29.519
That's all I can tell ya.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.020
(Sighs)

07:31.021 --> 07:33.152
(Megan) So our
welder won big-time

07:33.153 --> 07:35.124
at the casino on Monday,

07:35.125 --> 07:36.956
flashed his cash around,

07:36.957 --> 07:38.958
and then drove
off in a sports car

07:38.959 --> 07:40.990
with some mystery
man. And five days later,

07:40.991 --> 07:43.694
someone turned him
into a human Jigsaw.

07:45.195 --> 07:46.997
Empty.

07:48.569 --> 07:51.040
This one's empty, too. Lacey's
gonna be at the office soon.

07:51.041 --> 07:54.143
Let's just talk to the owner,
find out who picks up the trash.

07:54.144 --> 07:56.475
Whoa. Hey. Hey, nice puppy.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.647
Yes!

07:57.648 --> 07:59.680
Ooh. (Exhales sharply)

08:02.012 --> 08:04.714
(Plastic bag rustling)

08:04.715 --> 08:07.687
Megan...

08:07.688 --> 08:10.059
We've got two more body parts...

08:10.060 --> 08:11.892
A knee and a thigh.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.998
(Fabric snaps)

08:18.999 --> 08:21.231
♪♪♪

08:32.983 --> 08:36.145
This incision is either
a.C.L. Reconstruction

08:36.146 --> 08:38.988
or, if we're lucky, knee
replacement surgery.

08:38.989 --> 08:41.851
I'm seeing well-healed
keloidal scars on the thigh,

08:41.852 --> 08:43.152
almost like branding.

08:43.153 --> 08:45.224
Is it his initials?
We still need an I.D.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.857
Mm. Good news. Knee
replacement surgery.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.159
Yes! I opened it up and
gave Peter the serial number

08:50.160 --> 08:52.161
I found on the
replacement part. Great.

08:52.162 --> 08:55.134
Curtis, you see if you can find the
source of those brand marks. Will do.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.307
What do you want me to do? You're going
to the dump to look for more body parts.

08:58.308 --> 08:59.839
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.871
I-I'm the one who
found the knee and thigh.

09:01.872 --> 09:03.873
Why... why I don't have to
go dig through the dump?

09:03.874 --> 09:06.616
Why don't you send Curtis?
Well, clearly, you're good at it.

09:06.617 --> 09:09.849
Look, somebody cut this
guy up into little pieces

09:09.850 --> 09:11.851
and threw him away
like yesterday's trash.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.953
The rest of him is
probably still at the dump.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.085
I want him whole. Nobody
deserves to end up like that.

09:16.086 --> 09:18.127
Yes, doctor. Thank you.

09:18.128 --> 09:19.629
(Elevator bell dings)

09:19.630 --> 09:21.090
Hi, mom.

09:21.091 --> 09:24.293
Oh! Lace? I wasn't expecting
you for an hour. (Chuckles)

09:24.294 --> 09:26.836
Dad dropped me off early. Right.

09:26.837 --> 09:29.098
Is that a body? 'Cause
that's exactly the kind of stuff

09:29.099 --> 09:33.273
I should be getting on camera. O-Okay, all
right. Camera off. Camera off. My office. Now.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.112
Eww! What isthat?

09:43.113 --> 09:44.654
Nothing. Nothing.

09:44.655 --> 09:46.185
(Whispers) Okay.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.257
(Normal voice) All right...
(Sighs) Here are the rules.

09:48.258 --> 09:50.259
I've drawn up a
map of the office

09:50.260 --> 09:52.261
and marked on the areas

09:52.262 --> 09:54.263
where you can and
definitely cannot go.

09:54.264 --> 09:57.667
I've arranged for everyone
to speak with you for...

09:57.668 --> 09:59.729
(Object clatters)
A half an hour.

09:59.730 --> 10:02.972
Here is your schedule,
and here is a list of questions

10:02.973 --> 10:06.135
that I thought you might wanna
ask. Mom, what are you doing?

10:06.136 --> 10:09.608
There will be no filming
of bodies or body parts

10:09.609 --> 10:11.610
or bodies under
sheets or bodies period.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.612
What I want you to
understand is these are people,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.045
and we respect
them at all times.

10:16.046 --> 10:19.949
I'm supposed to do all of
this myself. I know, but I...

10:19.950 --> 10:23.694
Your first interview is
Dr. Murphy, right down the hall.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.298
(Sighs) Bad time?

10:29.299 --> 10:33.032
No, fine. What's up? I tracked
down the serial number of that knee.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.064
That particular joint was
installed one year ago

10:35.065 --> 10:37.106
in the knee of Callum
Shane O'Donnell,

10:37.107 --> 10:39.208
widowed, age 59. We have a name.

10:39.209 --> 10:42.111
We have a name. But no address.
How can somebody have knee surgery

10:42.112 --> 10:45.114
and not leave an address? All
billing was sent to a Mr. Dean Avery.

10:45.115 --> 10:47.176
Son-in-law. He's married
to Cal's daughter Jenny.

10:47.177 --> 10:49.719
They live five minutes away.

10:49.720 --> 10:53.052
(Cries) Yeah, that's him.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.425
I know this is very difficult.

10:56.426 --> 10:58.257
Are you sure?

10:58.258 --> 11:02.331
The scars? It's from
the Ben Franklin bridge.

11:02.332 --> 11:04.764
His broken toes?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.235
The rouse tower.

11:06.236 --> 11:08.898
A cement mixer fell on his foot.

11:08.899 --> 11:11.140
It sounds like he
had a rough life.

11:11.141 --> 11:14.243
He didn't think so. He loved it.

11:14.244 --> 11:16.175
He loved building things.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.307
He loved sitting
on a steel girder

11:18.308 --> 11:20.309
1,000 feet in the air,

11:20.310 --> 11:23.753
eating his lunch over the
city that he helped to build.

11:23.754 --> 11:27.016
He used to take me
up there with him.

11:27.017 --> 11:31.390
I loved it, too.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.863
W-Why would
someone do this to him?

11:33.864 --> 11:35.224
(Jenny cries)

11:35.225 --> 11:37.727
When was the last
time you saw him?

11:37.728 --> 11:40.199
I haven't seen him
since his knee surgery.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.773
We spoke on the phone
every once in a while, but...

11:43.774 --> 11:45.775
He and Dean didn't
really get along.

11:45.776 --> 11:48.077
That right, Mr. Avery?

11:48.078 --> 11:51.140
Money's tight. He
always had his hand out.

11:51.141 --> 11:53.382
He needed us, and
we weren't there for him!

11:53.383 --> 11:55.084
(Sighs)

11:55.085 --> 11:56.946
Your father won big

11:56.947 --> 11:59.248
at canyon creek
casino last week.

11:59.249 --> 12:02.091
He was last seen with a
man in a black sports car.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.853
That ring any bells?

12:03.854 --> 12:07.296
Wait a sec. How much money
are we talking about? 25 grand.

12:07.297 --> 12:09.398
(Scoffs) Aw, that's just great.

12:09.399 --> 12:12.331
Is that a problem? He
comes around last year

12:12.332 --> 12:15.204
and says his insurance
won't pay for his knee surgery.

12:15.205 --> 12:18.868
Could we foot the bill? So I
tell him to mortgage his home.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.070
That's when I find out, he
didn't even own the place.

12:21.071 --> 12:23.773
He's been there 30
years on rent control,

12:23.774 --> 12:25.776
and I'm paying for his new knee?

12:32.022 --> 12:33.352
(Beeps)

12:33.353 --> 12:36.285
All right, your mom said to
answer all your questions,

12:36.286 --> 12:39.288
so fire away. Who are
you and what do you do?

12:39.289 --> 12:41.290
My name is Kate Murphy.
I'm the chief medical examiner.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.163
I oversee an office
of 50-some people,

12:44.164 --> 12:45.835
including medical
examiners, fellows,

12:45.836 --> 12:47.296
investigators, and staff.

12:47.297 --> 12:49.498
You're my mom's
boss? Yes. I hired her.

12:49.499 --> 12:52.001
So what you say
overrules what she says?

12:52.002 --> 12:54.303
Technically, yeah. Can
you show me a dead body?

12:54.304 --> 12:57.877
(Laughs) Th... uh, that...
That's a little forward.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.949
Does that mean yes?

12:59.950 --> 13:02.051
That means let's
stick to the script.

13:02.052 --> 13:04.783
Uh... "How would you
describe my mother?"

13:04.784 --> 13:07.216
Um, I think it's safe to
say that your mother is...

13:07.217 --> 13:09.218
Determined to be the
best at what she does.

13:09.219 --> 13:12.221
She's very committed to the
job. So what you're saying is,

13:12.222 --> 13:14.263
even when my mom's not in
charge, she's still in charge.

13:14.264 --> 13:17.097
In this case, you better
believe it. (Chuckles)

13:24.334 --> 13:26.035
(Sam) Whoa.

13:26.036 --> 13:29.208
Nice digs for a
construction worker.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.280
You're the ones
who called about Cal.

13:31.281 --> 13:32.541
You the landlord?

13:32.542 --> 13:34.443
Uh, owner.

13:34.444 --> 13:36.916
Mike Walsh.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.387
What happened to him?

13:38.388 --> 13:41.150
What makes you think
something happened to him?

13:41.151 --> 13:42.892
Well, you're here, for one.

13:42.893 --> 13:46.195
And, uh, I usually get a call
from Cal, like, once a day.

13:46.196 --> 13:49.328
The sink's leaking, garbage
disposal doesn't work.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.461
But, uh, last few days, nothing.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.239
Uh, anything else I can help
you with? We'll let you know.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.611
(Mike) Oh.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.879
Nice.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.855
How's it going in here?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.158
How's it going out there?

14:19.159 --> 14:22.061
Your daughter's a lot like
you. Is that good or bad?

14:22.062 --> 14:23.292
Amusing.

14:23.293 --> 14:26.495
Don't worry. I stuck
to your questions.

14:26.496 --> 14:30.199
Callum Shane O'Donnell.
Fellow irishman.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.172
Do we know
anything more? Well...

14:33.173 --> 14:35.475
(Water sloshing) Unless
he was injected with water...

14:37.978 --> 14:40.609
He was frozen?

14:40.610 --> 14:42.411
Huh.

14:42.412 --> 14:45.114
No sign of struggle.

14:45.115 --> 14:49.188
Nothing amiss except
a leaky bathroom faucet.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.560
(Cell phone rings)

14:51.561 --> 14:53.122
(Sighs) (Rings and beeps)

14:53.123 --> 14:54.263
Yeah?

14:54.264 --> 14:56.065
(Megan) Check the freezer.

14:56.066 --> 14:57.226
What?

14:57.227 --> 14:58.897
Check the freezer.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.370
Now.

15:05.575 --> 15:08.078
Sam?

15:12.682 --> 15:17.087
I think we just found the rest
of Callum Shane O'Donnell.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.330
(Man) I got an even dozen, Sam.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.662
(Peter) Over here. (Sam) So far.
When you finish taking every body part

15:33.663 --> 15:35.634
out of the freezer, it
needs to be catalogued.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.567
I'm also gonna need you
guys to photograph each piece,

15:38.568 --> 15:40.569
both in and out of its wrapping.

15:40.570 --> 15:44.313
(Man) You want me to unwrap
'em now? No, let's wait for the m.E.

15:44.314 --> 15:46.515
We think this is
almost all of him.

15:46.516 --> 15:47.576
"Almost"?

15:47.577 --> 15:49.248
We're missing the head.

15:49.249 --> 15:52.382
Who would do
something like this?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.725
I need you to stay
outside, Mr. Walsh.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.727
And I also wanna
talk to your tenants,

15:58.728 --> 16:01.360
so a list of names
would be helpful.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.132
Sure. S-Sure.

16:03.133 --> 16:06.996
(Police radio chatter)

16:06.997 --> 16:10.239
Somebody cuts a man up,
throws half of him in a dumpster,

16:10.240 --> 16:12.241
and the other half on ice.

16:12.242 --> 16:13.203
Hmm.

16:13.204 --> 16:15.204
You have a theory?

16:15.205 --> 16:16.605
No.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.978
Come with me.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.354
(Spritzing)

16:25.355 --> 16:28.517
All right, so this is
where he was cut up.

16:28.518 --> 16:32.991
Whoever did it did a
hell of a clean-up job.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.723
I think he missed a spot.

16:34.724 --> 16:37.096
(Police radio chatter)

16:37.097 --> 16:40.099
All right, guys, we're gonna
take these drains apart.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.431
Sink, too.

16:42.432 --> 16:44.433
Let's go talk to the
neighbors. (Snaps gloves)

16:44.434 --> 16:47.206
You can't have the
Philly chain saw massacre

16:47.207 --> 16:49.308
going on next door
and not hear something.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.181
We didn't hear a thing,
but then we wouldn't have.

16:52.182 --> 16:53.512
Why is that?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.344
When we moved in,

16:55.345 --> 16:57.516
Cal would turn up his TV so
loud, it always wakes the baby.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.518
We had to get the whole
place soundproofed.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.121
What about you, Mr. Ling?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.123
You and Cal get along?

17:04.124 --> 17:07.256
I barely knew the guy
except to say hello.

17:07.257 --> 17:09.258
(Megan) You seem
a little anxious.

17:09.259 --> 17:12.201
Someone chopped up
a body right next door.

17:12.202 --> 17:14.533
Why don't you find the
guy instead of bothering us?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.705
(Indistinct conversations,
baby fusses)

17:16.706 --> 17:18.207
(Woman) Across the street!

17:18.208 --> 17:20.209
(Man) I'm sorry. You
can't come in here, ma'am.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.670
A crime has been committed.

17:21.671 --> 17:23.342
(Eastern European
accent) That's terrible.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.344
Can you tell me what happened?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.346
That's all I can say right
now. You need to go.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.348
That's okay. I got it. Okay.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.350
You live here? No.
I am nanny for baby.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.722
Oh, for the lings in 3a?

17:33.723 --> 17:37.126
What's your name?
Jasmina. Jasmina ruzic.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.389
Please, what happened? The
man in 3b, did you know him?

17:40.390 --> 17:43.532
Mr. O'Donnell? Yes.

17:43.533 --> 17:45.194
I-Is he okay?

17:45.195 --> 17:47.266
Well, actually, he's dead.

17:47.267 --> 17:51.770
Did the lings ever give
Mr. O'Donnell any trouble? No.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.803
Mr. Ling seemed a little
jumpy when we talked to him.

17:54.804 --> 17:57.306
Mr. Ling is... is big smoker.

17:57.307 --> 18:00.078
Mrs. Ling won't let him
smoke around baby.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.710
Only outside.

18:01.711 --> 18:04.513
Please. If I am late, big
trouble with Mrs. Ling.

18:04.514 --> 18:07.486
Thank you. Go ahead.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.319
(Door opens)

18:10.320 --> 18:12.361
(Elevator bell dings)

18:12.362 --> 18:13.522
Hey.

18:13.523 --> 18:16.365
(Sniffs) Oh.

18:16.366 --> 18:19.268
Hi. I'm Ethan. Sorry I'm
late. I was just at the...

18:19.269 --> 18:22.401
I was at the dump.
(Sighs deeply)

18:22.402 --> 18:25.404
Oh, no. Oh, no.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.576
(Grunts)

18:27.577 --> 18:28.737
(Sighs)

18:28.738 --> 18:30.239
I'm talking to

18:30.240 --> 18:32.241
forensic pathology fellow
Dr. Ethan gross. (Sighs)

18:32.242 --> 18:35.214
Why were you at the city dump?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.685
Looking for body parts.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.688
A man's foot and hand were
found in a field yesterday.

18:39.689 --> 18:43.252
And then earlier today, I found
a knee and a thigh in an alley.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.394
Can I see them?

18:45.395 --> 18:48.257
Sure. If... what? No. No! No.
Your mom had questions, right?

18:48.258 --> 18:50.359
Have you read these questions?

18:50.360 --> 18:53.362
How am I supposed to learn
anything about what my mom does

18:53.363 --> 18:55.264
with these lame questions?
Lame? (Speaks indistinctly)

18:55.265 --> 18:57.135
How about number four?

18:57.136 --> 19:00.369
"Name your three biggest
influences in medicine and why."

19:00.370 --> 19:03.612
(Sighs) You know, I
remember, uh, the first time I saw

19:03.613 --> 19:06.575
Rembrandt's "the
anatomy of Dr. Tulp."

19:06.576 --> 19:09.318
I-I thought it was lame,
like these questions. Lame.

19:09.319 --> 19:10.919
So...

19:10.920 --> 19:12.651
Show me something cool.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.853
So aside from the
healed peptic ulcer,

19:14.854 --> 19:17.556
I'd say that Cal was in
remarkably good shape

19:17.557 --> 19:20.229
for somebody with
debilitating arthritis.

19:20.230 --> 19:22.231
Let's find out what he was on.

19:22.232 --> 19:25.494
Run a tox tissue test
for medications, will you?

19:25.495 --> 19:27.566
Our killer definitely
knew his joints.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.238
These are very clean cuts.

19:29.239 --> 19:31.240
And the kerf marks
at the separation points

19:31.241 --> 19:32.641
are consistent.

19:32.642 --> 19:34.643
I still say he used a hacksaw.

19:34.644 --> 19:37.346
And from the angle,
I'd say right-handed.

19:37.347 --> 19:40.249
Then he would've have to
have held each body part

19:40.250 --> 19:43.181
firmly in his left hand while
he sawed with his right.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.353
Yeah.

19:44.354 --> 19:47.856
So let's check for residue
to the left of every cut point.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.588
(Clicks)

19:49.589 --> 19:51.290
Hmm.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.791
I got something.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.294
Here above the wrist.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.825
Two smudges.

19:56.826 --> 19:58.397
Dark powder.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.868
Fine residue.

19:59.869 --> 20:03.502
Didn't you say that
somebody grabbed Cal's arm

20:03.503 --> 20:05.504
before shoving him into a car?

20:05.505 --> 20:07.276
That's right.

20:07.277 --> 20:11.280
It could be transfer
from our mystery man.

20:11.281 --> 20:13.942
I'll put it under a microscope.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.944
We practically
dismantled the place.

20:15.945 --> 20:17.986
Guess what else is
missing besides Cal's head.

20:17.987 --> 20:19.818
The casino money. Bingo.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.820
Maybe he put it in the bank.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.523
Checked the balance.
Not there either.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.755
But his social security money
has been coming out of the bank

20:26.756 --> 20:29.428
every other week in $500
checks made out to cash.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.960
Detective, we found
this blue contact lens

20:31.961 --> 20:34.803
in the trap in the
bathroom sink.

20:34.804 --> 20:36.004
Mm.

20:36.005 --> 20:37.736
(Police radio chatter)

20:37.737 --> 20:39.768
I don't see Cal putting
in contact lenses

20:39.769 --> 20:41.770
with two arthritic hands.

20:41.771 --> 20:43.272
Then whose is it?

20:43.273 --> 20:47.446
(Camera shutter clicks)

20:47.447 --> 20:50.349
Her eyes were blue this morning.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.781
(Dean) You wanna
leave?! Then leave!

20:52.782 --> 20:54.753
But you're not
taking that with you!

20:54.754 --> 20:56.785
(Jenny) It's mine!
The hell it is!

20:56.786 --> 20:58.487
(Man) Go! Go! Go!
(Man shouts indistinctly)

20:58.488 --> 21:01.491
No, get your hands off me!

21:05.395 --> 21:07.396
(Sam chuckles)

21:07.397 --> 21:11.340
Don't tell me. You
won it in a poker game.

21:11.341 --> 21:14.444
(Police radio chatter)

21:26.416 --> 21:28.417
My dad called to tell me

21:28.418 --> 21:31.320
he had some money
he wanted to give me.

21:31.321 --> 21:34.323
I thought it was money to pay
us back for his knee surgery.

21:34.324 --> 21:38.427
But when I got
there, it was 25 grand.

21:38.428 --> 21:40.429
He wanted to give it to me.

21:40.430 --> 21:42.431
I... i couldn't believe it.

21:42.432 --> 21:44.873
So your father just
gave you all that money?

21:44.874 --> 21:48.377
I started crying. And
then I lost my contact.

21:48.378 --> 21:50.679
I washed my face
in the bathroom.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.681
So what about the 500
bucks every other week

21:52.682 --> 21:55.684
made out to cash? What
500 bucks every other week?

21:55.685 --> 21:59.047
I never saw 500
bucks from him period.

21:59.048 --> 22:01.490
If I'd have known he was
giving it away, I would've...

22:01.491 --> 22:04.993
You would've what? (Jenny) Dean
isn't the easiest man to live with.

22:04.994 --> 22:08.357
There were some things I had
to give up when I married him.

22:08.358 --> 22:09.858
Like what?

22:09.859 --> 22:11.860
Art school.

22:11.861 --> 22:15.464
Those drawings in
your father's apartment...

22:15.465 --> 22:16.935
You did them?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.938
That's why dad
gave me the money.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.711
He knew I wasn't happy...

22:22.712 --> 22:24.443
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

22:24.444 --> 22:26.715
And he... (Sighs)

22:26.716 --> 22:28.717
He knew what would cure it.

22:28.718 --> 22:30.419
Leaving Dean?

22:30.420 --> 22:32.721
A new life.

22:32.722 --> 22:35.824
Follow my dreams.

22:35.825 --> 22:39.488
And then Dean found the money.

22:39.489 --> 22:41.590
(Sighs)

22:41.591 --> 22:44.092
(Peter) Those are a lot
of tears. You believe her?

22:44.093 --> 22:46.134
Well, she has
opportunity but no motive.

22:46.135 --> 22:48.136
Or maybe her story is bogus

22:48.137 --> 22:50.098
and Cal didn't give her
the money. She took it.

22:50.099 --> 22:52.671
That's a rather cynical view
of father-daughter relations.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.073
We've got her d.N.A.
From the apartment, not his.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.146
Yeah, but he's the one with the Tarzan
temper, not her. But that temper didn't pop

22:58.147 --> 23:01.650
until after Cal was already dead,
right? Unlesshisstory's bogus.

23:01.651 --> 23:04.983
Or maybe they're in it
together. How's that for cynical?

23:04.984 --> 23:06.415
(Chuckles)

23:06.416 --> 23:08.657
Hey! How we doing?

23:08.658 --> 23:11.690
Mom, what happened to the
guy who got chopped into pieces?

23:11.691 --> 23:13.922
Who told you that?

23:13.923 --> 23:15.424
Ethan.

23:15.425 --> 23:16.825
(Gulps)

23:16.826 --> 23:18.126
A word, please.

23:18.127 --> 23:19.628
Mnh-mnh.

23:19.629 --> 23:22.901
Mom, I didn't come here to
see what you want me to see.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.435
I came here to learn about
what you do. Remember?

23:26.436 --> 23:28.707
Curtis, I believe it's
time for your interview.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.409
(Whispers) Thanks a lot.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.015
Start sectioning.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.488
You know, she said
we didn't have to stick

23:39.489 --> 23:41.820
with the questions.
She is 12 years old.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.793
Seeing your first dead body
can be a traumatic experience.

23:44.794 --> 23:47.596
I do not want her to see
anythingin the wrong context.

23:47.597 --> 23:50.098
You know, what is the
right context anyway?

23:50.099 --> 23:52.701
W-We're trying to
understand how this man died

23:52.702 --> 23:55.704
based on the parts we can
see, and it's getting us nowhere.

23:55.705 --> 23:58.166
I mean, has it ever
occurred to you that Lacey is

23:58.167 --> 24:00.909
trying to understand
you, but all she can see

24:00.910 --> 24:03.141
are the parts that you're
willing to show her?

24:03.142 --> 24:05.113
I'm sectioning.

24:05.114 --> 24:07.476
I am sectioning.

24:07.477 --> 24:09.479
Wait a second.

24:10.980 --> 24:13.522
I found this mixed
with a blood clot

24:13.523 --> 24:15.525
in one of the
pulmonary arteries.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.528
Here.

24:19.529 --> 24:21.661
You have any idea what it is?

24:27.697 --> 24:29.598
I'm sorry.

24:29.599 --> 24:32.470
Aren't you supposed to
be interviewing me now?

24:32.471 --> 24:35.103
What's the point? You're
not gonna show me anything.

24:35.104 --> 24:37.245
Look, some things
you'd see in this place

24:37.246 --> 24:40.509
would make your hair
stand on end. Like what?

24:40.510 --> 24:42.511
Like your mother on a warpath.

24:42.512 --> 24:44.653
I'm already familiar with that.

24:44.654 --> 24:47.656
She's such a control freak.
Do you know she printed up

24:47.657 --> 24:50.258
a list of questions for
me to ask everyone?

24:50.259 --> 24:52.821
Mm-hmm. I got a copy.

24:52.822 --> 24:56.194
Like I'm gonna find out anything
by talking to you guys anyway.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.196
Rules are meant to be broken.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.600
Even your mother can appreciate
that. Turn on the camera.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.201
Turn it on.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.174
(Camera beeps)

25:06.175 --> 25:09.237
This is the material we
found above the wrist.

25:09.238 --> 25:10.780
It's cigarette ash.

25:13.042 --> 25:15.243
Look.

25:15.244 --> 25:16.845
Hello.

25:16.846 --> 25:19.117
Mom. Uh, don't have
a freak-out, okay?

25:19.118 --> 25:22.190
He wasn't showing
me anything bad.

25:22.191 --> 25:24.823
This is the material we
found above the wrist.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.895
It's cigarette ash.

25:26.896 --> 25:28.857
You'd need to be a
pretty heavy smoker

25:28.858 --> 25:31.860
to accumulate this much on
your fingertips. If you give me

25:31.861 --> 25:36.164
a few more minutes, I can probably tell
you the brand. Thank you very much, Curtis.

25:36.165 --> 25:38.166
Would you please
call detective baker

25:38.167 --> 25:41.109
and share that
information with her

25:41.110 --> 25:44.843
and ask her to find out what brand
James ling smokes? I'm not in trouble?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.976
No. Not at all.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.620
You...

25:51.621 --> 25:53.252
Come with me.

26:00.590 --> 26:03.261
(Siren wails, woman
shouts indistinctly)

26:03.262 --> 26:06.334
(Car door closes) The m.E.'S office
puts your cigarette ash on Cal's arm.

26:06.335 --> 26:09.668
It was you who drove him
back from the casino that night,

26:09.669 --> 26:11.670
in your black
sports car, wasn't it?

26:11.671 --> 26:14.673
A little guy time, away
from the wife and baby.

26:14.674 --> 26:18.046
You can understand that, can't you?
So you see Cal win all this money,

26:18.047 --> 26:20.078
you wait for him
in the parking lot,

26:20.079 --> 26:23.111
and then you force him into the car.
Wait. Wait. Ihelpedhim into the car.

26:23.112 --> 26:26.154
The man had a limp. He
stumbled. I grabbed him.

26:26.155 --> 26:28.687
And then what? Then
nothing. I drove home.

26:28.688 --> 26:31.920
He went his way. I went
mine. I didn't see him after that.

26:31.921 --> 26:35.764
So why lie about it? I never would
have heard the end of it with Mira.

26:35.765 --> 26:37.295
She hated Cal's guts.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.298
It's been hard on her,
home all day with the baby.

26:40.299 --> 26:44.332
I didn't want to make it worse. Oh, come on.
How hard can it be with a full-time nanny?

26:44.333 --> 26:46.235
Nanny?

26:47.837 --> 26:49.307
Turn on your camera.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.279
(Beeps)

26:51.280 --> 26:55.083
Hold up your hand.

26:55.084 --> 26:57.385
Look at it.

26:57.386 --> 27:01.249
Now imagine that your
hand was the only thing

27:01.250 --> 27:03.621
that told the story of you.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.826
What were your
dreams? Who loved you?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.729
Who's grieving now
that you're gone?

27:10.730 --> 27:14.202
It's a small, delicate hand,

27:14.203 --> 27:16.204
the hand of a young girl

27:16.205 --> 27:19.107
who wears nail Polish.

27:19.108 --> 27:22.640
What does that
color say about her?

27:22.641 --> 27:26.174
What has she held in her hand?

27:26.175 --> 27:29.748
The reins of a horse?

27:29.749 --> 27:31.851
The hand of a boy?

27:41.691 --> 27:42.791
(Sighs)

27:42.792 --> 27:44.793
This is the hand

27:44.794 --> 27:48.296
of Callum Shane O'Donnell.

27:48.297 --> 27:52.801
He built skyscrapers
with this hand.

27:52.802 --> 27:56.975
He held his baby daughter
Jenny with this hand.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.347
This hand gave her money

27:59.348 --> 28:03.181
so that she could follow her
dream and go to art school.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.254
We do a lot of
different things here,

28:06.255 --> 28:08.887
but they all have
the same goal...

28:08.888 --> 28:10.959
To find out what happened

28:10.960 --> 28:13.461
so that a family can mourn,

28:13.462 --> 28:17.025
so that the right person
is held accountable.

28:17.026 --> 28:19.968
They're not just dead
bodies to us, lace.

28:19.969 --> 28:24.472
They're the stories of a life,

28:24.473 --> 28:27.275
and it's our job to tell it.

28:27.276 --> 28:30.278
Do you know who killed him?

28:30.279 --> 28:34.182
We don't even know
how he died yet.

28:34.183 --> 28:35.845
Look at this.

28:37.947 --> 28:39.989
(Object clatters)

28:42.291 --> 28:46.956
This is tissue that we
found in his pulmonary artery.

28:48.257 --> 28:49.958
You can hold it.

28:49.959 --> 28:52.061
Here.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.934
It's like putting
together a puzzle.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.137
Sometimes there's just
one piece that won't fit.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.340
Maybe it's in the wrong place.

29:05.174 --> 29:07.475
The killer had to have
tremendous upper body strength.

29:07.476 --> 29:11.419
Dean Avery fits that bill. Let's not rule out
a woman just because of upper body strength.

29:11.420 --> 29:14.422
The daughter had opportunity.
And we still have no cause of death.

29:14.423 --> 29:17.886
What happened to our tox
screen? Uh, we're still waiting on it.

29:17.887 --> 29:20.889
We don't need it. Thanks to
Lacey, we have an answer.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.962
Cause of death is blunt
force trauma to the head.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.534
But... we don't have the
head. We don't need that either.

29:26.535 --> 29:29.267
You know that mystery tissue
you found in Cal's pulmonary artery?

29:29.268 --> 29:31.399
It's brain tissue.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.202
He must have been
hit hard enough...

29:34.203 --> 29:35.443
To fracture the skull,

29:35.444 --> 29:38.206
lacerating the venous sinuses,

29:38.207 --> 29:41.109
allowing tiny
fragments of brain tissue

29:41.110 --> 29:43.952
to enter the superior vena cava,
which then went in to the heart

29:43.953 --> 29:47.355
and landed in the
pulmonary arteries.

29:47.356 --> 29:49.417
Tox screen results.

29:49.418 --> 29:53.061
Cal was taking methotrexate
for rheumatoid arthritis.

29:53.062 --> 29:56.424
Methotrexate? If Cal
had a peptic ulcer,

29:56.425 --> 29:58.266
he'd have to take
that by injection only.

29:58.267 --> 30:01.229
Tell me how a man who
has debilitating arthritis

30:01.230 --> 30:04.572
can inject himself. He was paying
someone 500 bucks every other week.

30:04.573 --> 30:07.135
(Kate sighs)

30:07.136 --> 30:08.977
Cal had a caretaker.

30:08.978 --> 30:10.438
(Cell phone alert
chimes) (Curtis) Hmm.

30:10.439 --> 30:13.081
Oh. That's your dad. Come on.

30:13.082 --> 30:16.084
Mom, I can't go now. It's just getting
interesting. Your dad's gonna be here any minute.

30:16.085 --> 30:18.887
What about my interview?
What about catching the killer?

30:18.888 --> 30:21.419
Oh, like mother, like daughter, huh? Honey,
even we know when to call it a night.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.893
No, you don't. You never stop.
(Chuckles) She's got you there.

30:24.894 --> 30:27.095
I've got something to tell you.

30:27.096 --> 30:29.097
I got something to
tell you. (Chimes)

30:29.098 --> 30:31.259
Oh, god. There's your father.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.561
I hope you got everything
that you needed.

30:33.562 --> 30:36.264
Please take her
downstairs, all right? Sure.

30:36.265 --> 30:37.565
Bye, lace.

30:37.566 --> 30:40.238
Turn your camera on. I
got something to show you.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.070
Come on. (Beeps)

30:42.071 --> 30:44.572
Cal O'Donnell had
a mystery helper,

30:44.573 --> 30:47.275
somebody who gave him
injections three times a week,

30:47.276 --> 30:50.178
yet managed to stay
completely off the radar.

30:50.179 --> 30:53.121
(Chuckles) Guess who
else stayed off the radar.

30:53.122 --> 30:54.422
Jasmina ruzic.

30:54.423 --> 30:56.224
The lings' nanny?

30:56.225 --> 30:58.226
The lings don't have a nanny,

30:58.227 --> 31:00.528
and jasmina ruzic doesn't exist.

31:00.529 --> 31:02.361
Hmm.

31:15.504 --> 31:19.007
(Elevator bell dings) Now the
lings didn't have a nanny, but Cal did.

31:19.008 --> 31:20.408
Jasmina ruzic.

31:20.409 --> 31:23.211
Real name... Irina tomislava.

31:23.212 --> 31:25.483
Former surgical nurse
from Belgrade, Serbia.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.485
Ah. How'd you'd find her?

31:27.486 --> 31:30.458
I tracked down the pharmacy
where Cal used to get

31:30.459 --> 31:32.390
his methotrexate
prescriptions filled.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.392
Irina used to pick them up.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.464
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

31:36.465 --> 31:40.468
We found this under the
spare in the trunk of your car.

31:40.469 --> 31:42.170
The m.E. Tells me

31:42.171 --> 31:45.303
it's the same blade
used to chop up Cal.

31:45.304 --> 31:48.336
Now you may have
an explanation for this.

31:48.337 --> 31:51.010
I'd love to hear it.

31:56.345 --> 31:58.447
You can talk to me, Irina.

32:01.450 --> 32:04.452
(Sighs) I tell you,

32:04.453 --> 32:07.125
she's one of the steeliest
killers I've ever met...

32:07.126 --> 32:10.428
Carves a man up, dumps
him, and doesn't even blink.

32:10.429 --> 32:14.233
Let me have a shot
at her, doctor to nurse.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.012
Cal took his meds.

32:24.013 --> 32:27.015
He was much more ambulatory
than I would've thought

32:27.016 --> 32:28.977
for somebody with his disease,

32:28.978 --> 32:30.979
which means hours
of physical therapy,

32:30.980 --> 32:33.421
massaging hands, massaging feet.

32:33.422 --> 32:36.254
You did an excellent
job. The body's the proof.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.457
You cared about him, Irina.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.090
So what happened...

32:42.091 --> 32:44.392
On that day,

32:44.393 --> 32:46.694
when you went
from being so caring,

32:46.695 --> 32:49.338
so... good...

32:51.340 --> 32:53.201
To chopping him up

32:53.202 --> 32:55.643
and throwing him out
like a piece of garbage?

32:55.644 --> 32:59.477
I didn't kill Mr. O'Donnell.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.010
I liked him.

33:02.011 --> 33:05.253
He was good to me,
paid me under the table.

33:05.254 --> 33:09.717
Grew up poor,
worked hard, like me.

33:09.718 --> 33:13.191
He was good man.

33:13.192 --> 33:16.525
He promised to help me bring
my son here from Belgrade.

33:18.227 --> 33:20.228
(Voice breaking) He made me hope

33:20.229 --> 33:23.331
for the first time.

33:23.332 --> 33:26.704
So you see, I would
never, ever harm this man.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.377
So you tell me what happened.

33:29.378 --> 33:31.779
I come in to check on him,

33:31.780 --> 33:36.044
find him on floor in
bathroom in bathrobe,

33:36.045 --> 33:39.087
and... he must have slipped.

33:39.088 --> 33:43.521
I tried to revive him,
but it was too late.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.353
He was long dead.

33:45.354 --> 33:47.595
Why not call 9-1-1?

33:47.596 --> 33:49.427
Why cut him up?

33:49.428 --> 33:51.429
He died before he could write

33:51.430 --> 33:54.662
last immigration letter
for me and my son.

33:54.663 --> 33:57.034
If Cal is found dead,

33:57.035 --> 33:59.467
I die, too... inside.

33:59.468 --> 34:03.641
I lose everything... my son...

34:03.642 --> 34:06.314
So maybe if I
could write letter,

34:06.315 --> 34:08.646
get this last piece of puzzle,

34:08.647 --> 34:10.448
I could be safe.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.721
My son could be safe.

34:13.722 --> 34:15.623
I had to hide him.

34:15.624 --> 34:18.386
And... carrying a 200-pound man

34:18.387 --> 34:19.687
by yourself

34:19.688 --> 34:22.430
through an apartment
complex was not an option.

34:22.431 --> 34:24.192
Yes.

34:24.193 --> 34:25.793
Irina...

34:25.794 --> 34:28.436
He was your friend.

34:28.437 --> 34:31.369
He had a daughter. What
a... What about his dignity?

34:31.370 --> 34:33.141
Dignity?

34:33.142 --> 34:34.472
Yes.

34:34.473 --> 34:39.076
I saw my first dead body
when I was 3 years old.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.450
One minute, Katya
and I are playing,

34:42.451 --> 34:45.653
the next, half of
her is across street.

34:45.654 --> 34:49.517
When you see that enough
times, you come to realize...

34:49.518 --> 34:52.290
Live when you can,

34:52.291 --> 34:55.694
because when you
are dead, you are just...

35:00.269 --> 35:04.272
I cannot pretend to know
what your life has been like,

35:04.273 --> 35:06.604
but I have seen my
share of dead bodies,

35:06.605 --> 35:08.607
and I do not agree with you.

35:10.439 --> 35:13.342
For what it's
worth, I believe you.

35:14.783 --> 35:16.514
(Chair scrapes floor)

35:16.515 --> 35:19.517
However, all we have is your
word that you didn't kill him,

35:19.518 --> 35:20.848
and it's not enough.

35:20.849 --> 35:23.191
I don't know how
to prove it to you.

35:23.192 --> 35:25.423
I do.

35:25.424 --> 35:29.697
Tell us what you
did with Cal's head.

35:29.698 --> 35:31.699
(People speaking indistinctly)

35:31.700 --> 35:33.701
(Bottles clinking)

35:33.702 --> 35:37.565
(Garbage bags rustling)

35:37.566 --> 35:39.167
(Siren whoops)

35:39.168 --> 35:40.638
(Objects clattering)

35:40.639 --> 35:42.570
(Police radio chatter)

35:42.571 --> 35:44.472
That's it.

35:44.473 --> 35:45.773
(Garbage bag thuds)

35:45.774 --> 35:47.345
(Man) Sir.

35:47.346 --> 35:50.348
(Man) Check inside.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.250
I'll take it.

35:52.251 --> 35:56.525
(Radio chatter continues)

36:03.492 --> 36:05.433
(Sighs) It's him.

36:05.434 --> 36:07.695
And?

36:07.696 --> 36:10.498
She's telling the truth, Sam.

36:10.499 --> 36:12.570
Irina didn't kill him.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.544
(Sighs)

36:27.656 --> 36:30.658
There's definitely a fracture
at the base of the skull,

36:30.659 --> 36:33.291
where Cal hit his
head on the bathtub.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.492
However,

36:34.493 --> 36:37.595
there is a second,
deeper fracture

36:37.596 --> 36:41.229
under the hair.

36:41.230 --> 36:44.272
Thatis the blow that killed him.

36:44.273 --> 36:47.405
Any idea what the weapon was? First
guess... good, old-fashioned hammer.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.577
I found a bit of particulate
matter in the wound.

36:49.578 --> 36:51.579
I'm running a trace on it.

36:51.580 --> 36:53.581
I need you to follow up, Peter.

36:53.582 --> 36:55.883
So why couldn't
Irina have done it?

36:55.884 --> 36:57.615
I'll show you.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.548
Irina found the body in the tub.

37:00.549 --> 37:02.720
Cal's standing right here.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.393
The killer comes up behind him,

37:05.394 --> 37:07.495
takes a big swing,

37:07.496 --> 37:09.857
leaving that Mark on the wall,

37:09.858 --> 37:14.532
and then brings it
down on Cal's skull.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.734
Irina could not
have left that Mark...

37:16.735 --> 37:19.867
Unless she was swinging
a 4-foot-long hammer.

37:19.868 --> 37:23.771
So now I'm looking for a
6-foot-tall mystery person,

37:23.772 --> 37:26.344
oh, sex unknown? (Sighs)

37:26.345 --> 37:28.876
(Cell phone rings)

37:28.877 --> 37:29.977
(Beeps)

37:29.978 --> 37:31.419
Megan.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.581
(Peter) According to the
boys, this one was easy.

37:33.582 --> 37:37.355
You got various metal compounds...
brass, copper... Most likely from nails.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.987
Let the man talk.
From nails, most likely,

37:39.988 --> 37:41.989
and fibers made
of synthetic stone.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.561
Synthetic stone?

37:43.562 --> 37:45.563
Yeah, it's called rock wool.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.635
It's, uh, used for
soundproofing.

37:47.636 --> 37:48.967
(Beep)

37:50.799 --> 37:53.801
We talked to the lings.
They told us that you did

37:53.802 --> 37:55.803
all the repairs in
that building yourself,

37:55.804 --> 37:57.505
including soundproofing
their apartment

37:57.506 --> 37:59.847
with a substance
called rock wool.

37:59.848 --> 38:03.311
You had enough sense
to get rid of the hammer,

38:03.312 --> 38:05.613
but your toolbox is
full of rock wool fibers

38:05.614 --> 38:07.315
and other assorted compounds...

38:07.316 --> 38:10.287
The same ones that we
found embedded in Cal's skull.

38:10.288 --> 38:14.492
Anybody could have taken my toolbox.
No forced entry. Only you had the key.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.293
I didn't do it.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.497
Callum O'Donnell was the
last tenant under rent control.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.370
He was the only thing
standing between you

38:22.371 --> 38:26.534
and turning that building into luxury condos.
(Scoffs) This is crazy. I didn't kill anybody.

38:26.535 --> 38:29.637
Yes, you did. Do you know how
bad this is gonna look to a jury?

38:29.638 --> 38:32.380
A disabled man
giving all his money

38:32.381 --> 38:34.682
to his daughter to
pursue her dream,

38:34.683 --> 38:37.445
and you not only kill
him for his apartment,

38:37.446 --> 38:40.448
you chop him up into bits
and shove him into his freezer.

38:40.449 --> 38:42.420
I didn't chop up anybody.

38:42.421 --> 38:45.723
I was surprised as anybody
that the body wasn't there.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.925
Which means only one thing...

38:47.926 --> 38:49.927
You knew where
the body should be,

38:49.928 --> 38:51.859
because you killed him.

38:51.860 --> 38:55.363
Cal let you into his apartment
to fix his leaky faucet,

38:55.364 --> 38:57.965
and you responded by
bashing him over the head

38:57.966 --> 39:00.808
with a hammer.

39:00.809 --> 39:03.711
You left him there, waiting for
somebody else to find the body.

39:03.712 --> 39:05.873
Nah.

39:05.874 --> 39:08.676
You could never cut somebody up,

39:08.677 --> 39:11.679
but you're perfectly capable
of killing a man for money

39:11.680 --> 39:14.522
and then leaving him there

39:14.523 --> 39:18.856
for somebody else to
find him dead on the floor.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.460
You're pathetic.

39:26.995 --> 39:29.597
(Megan) I'm releasing
your father's body

39:29.598 --> 39:31.569
for burial today.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.072
He wanted to be cremated.

39:35.073 --> 39:39.006
There's a hill in the park
that overlooks the city.

39:39.007 --> 39:41.479
He'd like that.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.011
I was so stupid.

39:44.012 --> 39:48.015
I missed out on the last
year of my father's life...

39:48.016 --> 39:51.158
All to be with a man
who never really knew me.

39:51.159 --> 39:53.761
That ends today.

39:53.762 --> 39:55.623
I'm leaving him

39:55.624 --> 39:58.126
and going back to school.

40:01.129 --> 40:03.702
I bet your dad
would like that, too.

40:07.676 --> 40:08.977
Thank you.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.617
Uh, what was that about
knowing when to call it a night?

40:19.618 --> 40:22.189
I'm just wrapping up. I swear.

40:22.190 --> 40:24.692
I, uh, heard from the d.A.

40:24.693 --> 40:28.656
He's decided to deport
Irina instead of filing charges.

40:28.657 --> 40:31.729
(Sighs) Well, at least
she'll be with her son.

40:31.730 --> 40:35.033
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:38.106 --> 40:39.808
(Computer chimes)

40:44.442 --> 40:47.675
Hi. My name is Lacey Fleming.
My mom is Dr. Megan hunt,

40:47.676 --> 40:49.577
and she works as
a medical examiner.

40:49.578 --> 40:52.580
I bet you think you
know what my mom does,

40:52.581 --> 40:54.952
that she cuts up dead
bodies for a living?

40:54.953 --> 40:57.485
That's what I thought,
too, but I was wrong.

40:57.486 --> 41:00.628
A man's foot and hand were
found in a field yesterday,

41:00.629 --> 41:03.991
and then earlier today, I found
a knee and a thigh in an alley.

41:03.992 --> 41:08.465
These are cholesterol
crystals in a rheumatoid nodule.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.668
They indicate he had arthritis.

41:10.669 --> 41:14.471
This is the material we
found above the wrist.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.973
It's cigarette ash.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.975
It's like putting
together a puzzle.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.548
Sometimes there's just
one piece that won't fit.

41:20.549 --> 41:23.511
And if that's all my mom
did... Put a puzzle together...

41:23.512 --> 41:25.513
That'd be really
cool, but it's not.

41:25.514 --> 41:27.915
So everybody who's
watching, look at your hand.

41:27.916 --> 41:30.087
Go ahead. Do it.
Really look at it.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.689
Imagine that your hand

41:31.690 --> 41:34.992
was the only thing that
told the story of you.

41:34.993 --> 41:39.627
What were your
dreams? Who loved you?

41:39.628 --> 41:42.499
Who's grieving now
that you're gone?

41:42.500 --> 41:44.902
I think it's safe to say
that your mother is...

41:44.903 --> 41:47.034
Determined to be the
best at what she does.

41:47.035 --> 41:49.036
She's very committed to the job.

41:49.037 --> 41:51.609
We go home at night,
just like everybody else,

41:51.610 --> 41:53.611
but we never really stop.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.283
You know why?

41:58.687 --> 42:01.518
It means "this is
where death rejoices

42:01.519 --> 42:03.692
to teach the living."

42:05.223 --> 42:07.655
Every person has
something to teach us,

42:07.656 --> 42:09.657
and we never stop learning.

42:09.658 --> 42:11.829
We do a lot of different
things around here,

42:11.830 --> 42:14.031
but they all have
the same goal...

42:14.032 --> 42:17.605
To find out what happened
so that a family can mourn,

42:17.606 --> 42:20.708
so that the right person
is held accountable.

42:20.709 --> 42:24.912
They're not just dead
bodies to us, lace.

42:24.913 --> 42:27.575
They're the stories of a life,

42:27.576 --> 42:29.617
and it's our job to tell it.

42:29.618 --> 42:32.249
(Lacey) His name was
Callum Shane O'Donnell.

42:32.250 --> 42:34.281
He was a father, a welder.

42:34.282 --> 42:36.624
He helped build this
city with his bare hands.

42:36.625 --> 42:39.627
And thanks to him, I finally
understand what my mom does,

42:39.628 --> 42:42.089
and I'm proud to
be her daughter.

42:42.090 --> 42:44.092
(Chuckles)
