My Burobu card collection.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.477
So, Burobu's like Pokémon,
but just everybody's a slug?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.261
-Uh, yeah.
-Finally.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.567
TINA:
Why are there three empty slots?

00:45.610 --> 00:49.310
Because I'm missing three of
the nine stages of Slugodactyl.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.267
My favorite slug.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.356
Gah, can you believe
this collection's

00:52.400 --> 00:54.184
taken me two and
a half years to build?

00:54.228 --> 00:57.100
Buying all these card packs,
making all these trades...

00:57.144 --> 00:58.884
Nerd. I-I mean... wow.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.148
Yeah, well, guess what.
Now I have a new plan.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.671
-Get another hobby?
-No.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.152
I'm gonna speed things up
with these less-than-authentic

01:05.194 --> 01:07.154
Burobu cards I found online.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.242
TINA:
Are they blurry?

01:08.285 --> 01:09.808
Only if you look at them.

01:09.852 --> 01:12.463
Here's the thing,
these are all Mega Ultra.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.858
When I trade with these,
mama gets what mama wants.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.861
Mega Ultra Macho Slugmarine.
Brag.

01:18.904 --> 01:22.212
Don't touch it too hard. The
ink's not the kind that dries.

01:22.256 --> 01:25.433
So, I'm gonna take a few
of these to school Monday,

01:25.476 --> 01:28.349
make some trades, get those
last three Slugodactyls,

01:28.392 --> 01:30.177
and my empire will be complete.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.613
ALL:
Yay!

01:31.656 --> 01:33.658
Wait, didn't you say those cards
got banned from school?

01:33.702 --> 01:35.704
Yeah, we got a little
out of control.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.140
Stop it.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.360
Put 'em away.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.623
KIDS: I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

01:41.666 --> 01:43.973
Son of a... All right,
you punks, that's it.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.453
Those cards are banned.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.237
If I see 'em again,
it's detention

01:47.281 --> 01:52.155
and I'm confiscating them.
Now apologize to America.

01:52.199 --> 01:55.376
But relax, we're not doing
the trades until after school.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.857
So there's my plan.
Feedback? Praise? Yes, Tina.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.990
It seems sort of... dishonest.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.296
I mean, those cards
are fake, right?

02:02.339 --> 02:04.689
Oh, I don't like the "F" word.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.127
I prefer non-official,
non-approved, m'kay? Uh, Tina.

02:08.170 --> 02:09.433
Now can we talk about our study
buddy time together tomorrow?

02:09.477 --> 02:11.174
I have some ideas.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.220
-Let's try to keep it on Burobu
for now, huh? Okay?
-Okay.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.743
-That's what we're doing
in my room right now.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:14.786 --> 02:17.267
-Okay.
-Okay. Uh, yes, Gene.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.400
Did John Lithgow play
John Larroquette in a movie,

02:19.443 --> 02:20.444
or was that just a dream?

02:20.488 --> 02:22.533
-Oh, that's a good one. Uh...
-Yeah.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.318
I thought you were only doing
Burobu questions.

02:24.361 --> 02:27.886
-I know, but that's interesting.
-LINDA: Kids! Dinner!

02:27.930 --> 02:29.584
What were you kids doing?

02:29.627 --> 02:31.716
Well, Louise is really excited
about her Burobu cards,

02:31.760 --> 02:34.328
but what some people think
is more exciting

02:34.371 --> 02:36.243
is we're gonna be
study buddies tomorrow.

02:36.286 --> 02:38.549
-Oh, yeah.
-Uh, what are you two
gonna be studying?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.160
We're supposed to help them
with homework

02:40.203 --> 02:41.944
from the class they just had.
So, math.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.293
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, God.
-What?

02:43.337 --> 02:46.383
It's just, Tina,
when it comes to math, you...

02:46.427 --> 02:47.950
-are... bad at it.
-Have room for improvement?

02:47.993 --> 02:50.257
Don't worry. I think I've found
someone to help.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.737
Oh, look, she's here now.

02:52.781 --> 02:56.263
'Sup? I'm Mathy Cathy from the
mean streets of Fraction Town.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.439
Sure, math is tough,
but so am I.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.483
-Hmm.
-Damn!

02:59.527 --> 03:01.268
I already feel
like I know more math.

-[phone ringing]
-Hello.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.010
Listen, kid.
Sometimes on the streets,

03:05.054 --> 03:06.577
-stuff doesn't add up.
-Yup.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.362
-Things can get negative.
-Yup. Yup.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.842
[sighs]
Okay, fine. B... Uh, bye.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.409
What was that about?

03:12.453 --> 03:15.412
Harry, the pickle guy
we used to go to-- he died.

03:15.456 --> 03:18.285
[gasp] Oh, no!
Poor Harry and his pickles.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.069
That was his lawyer
on the phone.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.375
Apparently, in his will,

03:21.418 --> 03:24.073
Harry requested that
I speak at the funeral.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.596
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.382
He must have forgotten to take
me out of his will after...

03:28.425 --> 03:29.731
The incident.

03:29.774 --> 03:32.255
-Okay. Don't say "the incident"
like that.
-Wha...?

03:32.299 --> 03:33.822
Whoa, whoa, wait, what incident?

03:33.865 --> 03:36.477
Which one of us
is the pickle man's child?

03:36.520 --> 03:37.826
I don't want to talk about it.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.306
Dad, would you be more
comfortable telling...

03:39.349 --> 03:42.744
Mathy Cathy? 'Cause, man,
I've seen some stuff.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.267
Thank you, Cathy, but no.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.487
LABONZ:
Okay, students,

03:46.530 --> 03:49.838
Mr. Ambrose is gonna watch you
during study buddy time

03:49.881 --> 03:53.668
while I go outside to not smoke
several cigarettes.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.713
Okay, do your math or whatever.
I don't know.

03:55.757 --> 03:57.585
You're never gonna use it.
I never use it.

03:57.628 --> 03:58.847
All right, tiny Andy,

03:58.890 --> 04:00.414
you want to get into some
fraction action?

04:00.457 --> 04:01.676
Half of me does.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.156
Zeke, do you want to draw stuff
on my arm?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.115
Oh, man!
Dang, do I ever! Come on.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.335
-Ow. Not with your pencil!
-Give me that arm.
Give it to me!

04:08.378 --> 04:09.640
-Ow! Zeke, that hurts!
-Come on. Give it to me!
Come on.

04:09.684 --> 04:11.555
Two-thirds plus four-fifths.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.644
The age-old question,
huh, Tammy?

04:13.688 --> 04:14.645
-Ooh... No, thanks.
-Okay.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.647
Jocelyn, braid my hair.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.519
Okay. Which one?

04:18.562 --> 04:19.868
Hey, Louise, your sister told me

04:19.911 --> 04:21.478
you had a beef
with some homework.

04:21.522 --> 04:22.305
Whoops. Little mishap.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.265
Okay, Louise, two hours
till school's over.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.702
Then you can trade.
You can make it.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.269
[strained]:
You can make it.

04:29.312 --> 04:30.531
No, you can't.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.141
Hey, Rudy, Large Tommy,
Andy, Ollie.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.708
You know how we were
gonna do that

04:33.751 --> 04:34.926
Burobu trade sesh after school?

04:34.970 --> 04:36.232
-Yup.
-Yeah.
-Big time.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.799
What if we go back
behind that shelf

04:37.842 --> 04:39.409
and do it right now?

04:39.453 --> 04:42.369
No way. We'll get detention and
the cards will be confiscated.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.284
-Yeah, they'll get constipated.
-No.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.503
Rudy, come on.

04:46.547 --> 04:49.114
Wow. That's a powerful argument.
Yeah, okay, I'm in.

04:49.158 --> 04:51.726
Whew, I'm back. Now let's
open up a can of whoop-ass

04:51.769 --> 04:53.510
on these fractions, huh, kid?

04:53.554 --> 04:55.425
Actually, you'd, uh,
really be helping old Cathy out

04:55.469 --> 04:57.035
if you read aloud the problems.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.646
So, Tina, Cathy, whatever, look.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.562
We're gonna hit the back corner
for a quick Burobu moment,

05:01.605 --> 05:03.390
and I need you
to be on the lookout.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.348
What? Now?
No, we'll get in trouble.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.654
Tina, I'm over here.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.525
Oh. What? Now?
No, we'll get in trouble.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.484
Come on, Tina. Get my back.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.616
Mathy Cathy would be down
with it, right?

05:12.660 --> 05:15.576
-Yeah. She's always down.
-Yeah.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.318
Okay, so if anyone comes,
just make a loud fart noise

05:18.361 --> 05:20.494
with your face or your butt
or whatever feels right.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.625
Let's go. Come on.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.498
So we're just gonna
go read something from a book.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.326
Seems like a waste of time,
but, sure, go nuts.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.588
What do I care?
I'd rather go home.

05:27.631 --> 05:30.547
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-[nervous groan]

05:30.591 --> 05:32.419
MORT:
So, Bob, you gonna be ready

05:32.462 --> 05:34.464
for Harry's service
at my place Tuesday night?

05:34.508 --> 05:36.161
Why is it at night, anyway?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.555
I think Harry wanted all
the other farmers market people

05:38.599 --> 05:40.644
to be able to go,
after they finish packing

05:40.688 --> 05:42.080
their unsold rhubarb.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.605
Ugh. All the farmer people
are gonna be there.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.390
Right! They all saw...
the incident.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.523
-Lin, stop.
-Incident.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.003
-Wh-What incident?
-[sighs] Okay, fine.
I'll tell you.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.484
I bought from Harry
for about ten years.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.007
We were friends,
farmers market friends.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.444
And then one day,

05:57.487 --> 06:00.403
I said maybe his latest batch
of sweet pickles

06:00.447 --> 06:03.798
was a little too sweet,
and he didn't take it well.

06:03.841 --> 06:07.628
He started throwing pickles
at me, and I retaliated.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.456
I picked up a pickle
and I threw it

06:09.499 --> 06:11.153
at that 80-year-old man's face.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.677
Oh, my God. Is that how he died?

06:13.721 --> 06:15.549
No, Teddy, that was
four years ago.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.420
He just died recently, remember?

06:17.464 --> 06:19.727
-Oh, right. Probably didn't
help, though, huh?
-It's true.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.686
Andy and Ollie, I think
you'll be very happy

06:22.730 --> 06:24.601
with this Mega Ultra
Slugerantula.

06:24.645 --> 06:27.430
I'm gonna rub it on my belly
to get my scent on it.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.040
Me, too. Then we'll be its mom.

06:29.084 --> 06:32.348
Uh, hey, not so much rubbing,
okay? Enjoy.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.958
Why do these smell
like gasoline?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.612
Oh, that's, uh, a new thing.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.135
-Oh, interesting.
-Yeah.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.659
[door opens]

06:38.702 --> 06:40.661
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.793
-Hey there.
-Oh, God, no.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.666
So, I just wanted to, uh,
super casually ask you

06:45.709 --> 06:48.408
if you'd heard anything
about some faculty folks

06:48.451 --> 06:51.585
getting together for
a Martini Tuesday kind of thing?

06:51.628 --> 06:54.501
-Oh, Martuesdays? Nope. Sorry.
-I... Oh. Oh. Because...

06:54.544 --> 06:56.024
Oh, my God. This cart of books

06:56.067 --> 06:58.635
-has to be anywhere else
right now.
-Nuts.

06:58.679 --> 06:59.854
Oh, thank God.

07:01.812 --> 07:05.337
-Ah! Okay. [weak fart noise]
-What the...?

07:05.381 --> 07:08.210
Eighth graders, where are
all the fourth graders?

07:08.253 --> 07:09.777
They're living their lives.

07:09.820 --> 07:12.562
-Tina? Tina?
-[weak fart noises]

07:12.606 --> 07:17.132
-Where are your study buddies?
-Uh...

07:17.175 --> 07:19.351
Okay, Louise,
I guess you've got a deal.

07:19.395 --> 07:22.224
Yes! All nine
Slugodactyls are mine.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.747
-Got you!
-[kids gasp]

07:23.791 --> 07:27.534
I'm taking those cards.
Thanks for telling me, Tina.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.753
[growls]

07:29.797 --> 07:31.363
Oh, crap.

07:31.407 --> 07:35.063
Wow, I've never been back here.
Ugh, it's just more books.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.763
BOB:
Well, Louise knew if she

07:39.807 --> 07:41.286
brought the Burobu cards
to school,

07:41.330 --> 07:43.245
she'd get detention
and they'd get confiscated

07:43.288 --> 07:45.421
and she shouldn't have put Tina
in that position.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.466
Yes. Right.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.729
Yeah, no, true,
but then Tina ratted on her.

07:48.772 --> 07:51.166
You never go against the family.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.603
-Never.
-Easy, Don Corleone.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.779
-You mean Don Pepperoni?
-You don't understand!

07:55.823 --> 07:57.128
Ms. Labonz made me talk.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.521
Where are they?

07:58.565 --> 08:00.828
-Where are your study buddies?
-Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

08:00.871 --> 08:02.873
-Where are they?
-Uh! Uh!

08:02.917 --> 08:04.222
-Hmm.
-Mmm...

08:04.266 --> 08:06.616
O-Okay, that might be
slightly exaggerated.

[glass squeaking]

[whispering]:
Yeah, me, too.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.318
[sighs]

08:13.362 --> 08:15.407
Louise, listen.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.670
I'm sorry about
what happened, but...

08:16.713 --> 08:19.324
LOUISE: Oh, can it! You knew how
much those cards meant to me,

08:19.368 --> 08:20.674
and you ratted anyway!

08:20.717 --> 08:22.719
You went against
the family, Tina.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.199
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.375
Because you're
a scaredy-butt banana rat!

08:26.418 --> 08:28.551
I think I follow, but what's
the banana part about?!

08:28.595 --> 08:30.510
-'Cause you're yella!
-Okay, got it!

08:30.553 --> 08:33.600
So... I'm guessing you two
have worked things out?

08:33.643 --> 08:36.341
Gene, you're gonna have
to choose: Tina or me?

08:36.385 --> 08:38.735
I lost one sister today.
Am I gonna lose another?

08:38.779 --> 08:42.173
Aah! I won't take sides!
I'm like a sexy Switzerland.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.828
Fine. Then you're both
dead to me.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.352
Hmm. Looks like we're
sleeping on the couch.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.399
So, how's your speech
for Harry coming, Bob?

08:50.442 --> 08:51.792
Yeah, did you work in the part

08:51.835 --> 08:53.620
where you hit him in the face
with a pickle?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.491
No, Teddy. I was gonna talk
about safe stuff.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.885
Like, all his stories
about dill.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.364
And you think that's gonna fly?

08:59.408 --> 09:00.888
Yeah, Bob,
there's gonna be a room

09:00.931 --> 09:02.672
full of judgmental farmers
watching you.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.195
Not to mention Harry,

09:04.239 --> 09:06.415
looking down on you
with his deformed face.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.852
I didn't deform his face.
It always looked weird.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.202
You know what you should do,
throw in some jokes. You know?

09:11.246 --> 09:13.770
-Pickle jokes.
-Ooh! What if
you said something like,

09:13.814 --> 09:15.946
"I'm glad everyone could
'cu-come-ber' to the service."

09:15.990 --> 09:17.208
No.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.732
How about this?

09:18.775 --> 09:20.777
"I relishthe opportunity
to speak here today."

09:20.821 --> 09:22.213
-Mm-mm.
-You should sing "Danny Boy,"

09:22.257 --> 09:24.912
but replace the word "pipes"
with "pickles," you know?

09:24.955 --> 09:26.696
-Oh, my God.
-Eh...

09:27.784 --> 09:30.700
And off Labonz goes
to Tuesday cafeteria duty,

09:30.744 --> 09:31.788
right on schedule.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.921
Now, Rudy, all you got to do
is stand watch

09:33.964 --> 09:36.793
while I pick the lock on her
desk and get our cards back.

09:36.837 --> 09:37.968
I don't feel comfortable
with this.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.840
Well, you sound ready to go.
Come on.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.364
Ah, wait! [inhales]
There she is.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.672
Hi, Ms. Labonz.
Uh, may we join you?

09:45.715 --> 09:46.673
Eh?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.022
What's going on?

09:48.065 --> 09:49.850
Are you two pulling a Clueless

09:49.893 --> 09:51.678
and trying to set me up
with another teacher?

09:51.721 --> 09:55.377
Not interested.
I like firemen, a lot.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.988
A-Actually, Ms. Labonz,
I-I just wanted to ask you

09:58.032 --> 10:00.817
if you could return the Burobu
cards to the fourth graders?

10:00.861 --> 10:03.037
No way. Not gonna happen.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.692
I'm hearing no
with a hint of yes?

10:05.735 --> 10:07.476
No! You know where
those cards are?

10:07.519 --> 10:10.000
In the bureau by my front door
in the drawer

10:10.044 --> 10:12.655
where I keep the baggies
I use to pick up the crap

10:12.699 --> 10:14.875
my neighbor's stupid dog,
Spritzel,

10:14.918 --> 10:18.269
leaves in my front yard,
so when I run out of bags,

10:18.313 --> 10:20.620
I'm gonna use the cards.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.665
Okay. Well, that
paints a picture.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.059
I looked everywhere-- nothing.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.843
Maybe she stashed them
in the teacher's lounge.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.192
Come on, let's move.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.760
Sneak into the teacher's lounge?
Oh, no, I need to sit down.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.720
-Oh, Rudy, God.
-Where's my inhaler?
Where's my inhaler?

10:33.763 --> 10:35.939
-It's right-- You're holding it.
-[wheezing]: Oh, my God.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.680
LOUISE:
Where are they?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.856
AMBROSE: Oh yeah, Labonz
is definitely in for tonight.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.988
Martini Tuesdays
are the only reason

10:41.031 --> 10:42.859
-she's still a teacher.
-Oh! Oh!

10:42.903 --> 10:44.426
And my roommate Joyce will be

10:44.469 --> 10:45.775
at her dumb kidney
donation thingy,

10:45.819 --> 10:47.908
so we can be as rowdy
as we want.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.953
-What about Frond?
-Yeah, does he know?

10:49.997 --> 10:52.216
Ugh, why does that buzzkill
want to come, anyway?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.218
He doesn't even drink,
which is amazing

10:54.262 --> 10:56.003
since he has so many reasons to.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.135
-[laughing]
-[Rudy inhales]

10:58.179 --> 10:59.876
BRANCA:
Did you hear that?

10:59.920 --> 11:02.705
-Ugh, Branca, again?
-It wasn't me.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.098
LINDA:
Okay, we're leaving.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.709
Wish your father good luck
with his Harry pickle eulogy.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.972
BOTH: Good luck with
your Harry pickle eulogy.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.887
I feel like we say that
too much.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.802
If Labonz doesn't have
the cards at school,

11:12.846 --> 11:14.543
where could they be?

11:14.586 --> 11:16.545
Louise, I don't know
if I expressed this enough,

11:16.588 --> 11:19.069
-but this is literally
killing me.
-TINA: Louise?

11:19.113 --> 11:21.245
I just wanted to say that
I tried to get the cards back

11:21.289 --> 11:22.812
from Ms. Labonz,
but she said no.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.901
But don't worry.
They're in a safe place.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.207
I mean, not really, they're in
the drawer by her front door,

11:26.250 --> 11:27.774
and she's gonna use them

11:27.817 --> 11:29.210
to pick up her neighbor's dog
Spritzel's poop.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.951
But, hey, forget that.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.953
Let's just work on rebuilding
our relationship.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.563
Oh, great, there you are.
Should we hug or something?

11:34.606 --> 11:36.043
Wait, why do you have
your lock-picking kit?

11:36.086 --> 11:37.914
Rudy, the cards are at Labonz's.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.090
We know she's not there
'cause it's Martini Tuesday.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.006
Meet me at her house, stat.
We're a go.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.574
-RUDY: Okay, I've been...
-Uh-oh. Louise? Louise!

11:45.617 --> 11:46.793
No go! No go! Aah!

11:51.667 --> 11:53.451
-Louise! Stop!
-What's going on?!

11:53.495 --> 11:54.496
I may have
accidentally told Louise

11:54.539 --> 11:55.802
exactly where Ms. Labonz

11:55.845 --> 11:57.107
has the Burobu cards
in her house

11:57.151 --> 11:58.718
and now Louise is going
over there to break in!

11:58.761 --> 12:00.502
Aah! She'll go to jail!

12:00.545 --> 12:02.460
What will I wear to visit her?

12:02.504 --> 12:04.985
You can't wear stripes,
so that's out.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.031
So, Bob, you'll be
batting cleanup.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.337
You feel loose?

12:09.380 --> 12:10.642
[whispering]:
You look terrible.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.079
-Thanks.
-Wait, is the urn a pickle jar?

12:12.122 --> 12:13.994
MORT:
Yes, it is.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.518
Did he want that or did you
just run out of urns?

12:16.561 --> 12:20.000
I think it's safe to assume
it's what he would have wanted.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.828
Hello. How are you?

12:21.871 --> 12:24.134
Oh, God, I feel
like everybody's looking at me.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.310
Nah. I bet they all forgot.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.573
Yeah, I know. He has some nerve
showing up here.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.140
They're probably talking
about someone else.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.925
What he did to Harry's face
with that pickle...

12:31.968 --> 12:33.404
That-that could be anybody.

12:33.448 --> 12:36.016
And now he's here in a wrinkled
suit with his fly open.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.104
Okay, that's you.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.932
Oh, God. Should I zip it?

12:38.975 --> 12:40.237
Don't give 'em the satisfaction.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.936
LOUISE:
Okay, looks like nobody's home.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.981
This is what they mean
by peer pressure.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.766
This is everything
they warned me about

12:46.809 --> 12:49.551
in that after school special,
Peers of a Clown.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.205
Stop. You can't do this.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.990
And I can't do this.
My thighs are thundering.

12:54.034 --> 12:56.079
This is breaking and entering,
Louise. It's a crime.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.081
Well, it's your fault
I have to crime this crime

12:58.125 --> 12:59.387
in the first place.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.867
GENE:
Someone's coming!

13:00.910 --> 13:03.695
-Hide.
-Aah!

13:03.739 --> 13:05.610
What the hell
are they doing here?

13:07.090 --> 13:08.962
Sorry we had to come here
because my dumb roommate, Joyce,

13:09.005 --> 13:11.051
wasn't a match
for the kidney donation

13:11.094 --> 13:13.923
and now she's just sitting on
the couch with all her kidneys,

13:13.967 --> 13:14.968
ruining everything.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.230
BRANCA:
It's okay.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.275
Labonz has got
that sweet backyard.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.886
They're going to the backyard.
Let's go.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.974
[whispering]:
Or we could just leave.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.236
Oh, you're going that way. Okay.

13:22.279 --> 13:27.023
Who wants to play
a drinking game?

13:27.067 --> 13:28.285
BRANCA:
Oh! Oh! Me, me, me, me, me!

13:28.329 --> 13:30.157
[gasps]
Our Burobu cards.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.593
Bastards.

13:31.636 --> 13:34.335
Hey there. I'm Alfred.
Leafy greens.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.945
I've known Harry a long time.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.252
Our booths were right next
to each other.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.471
He was a good man, a proud man,

13:40.515 --> 13:42.604
and when you got him
talking about dill,

13:42.647 --> 13:43.953
well, his face just lit up.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.868
It's so beautiful.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.392
And I'm, I'm, I'm glad
we could all be here,

13:48.436 --> 13:50.830
even if one of us committed
an unforgivable act

13:50.873 --> 13:52.135
for which he should be ashamed.

13:52.179 --> 13:53.310
-Okay.
-Mm.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.226
Hi. Hi, hello. We're divorced.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.141
LABONZ:
Ha! Branca,

13:58.185 --> 14:01.449
your slug has the lowest
health points. Slug it.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.885
This is a disgrace.

14:02.929 --> 14:03.930
They don't even know the rules.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.583
Well, nobody does.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.107
-Rudy, just shush.
-Sorry.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.935
They're not acting
that different.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.111
Are they always drunk?

14:11.154 --> 14:12.199
If only we could distract them,

14:12.242 --> 14:13.853
get them out of the yard
for a second,

14:13.896 --> 14:15.506
and we had a rope or something.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.204
Then we could tie it
around my waist,

14:17.247 --> 14:19.510
I could climb up this tree,
and you guys could lower me down

14:19.554 --> 14:21.164
and I could grab the cards.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.863
Man, if only we had a rope.
Too bad.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.516
[gasps] There was a hose
in the front yard.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.996
-Damn.
-I'll go get it.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.215
You guys think of a way
to distract them.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.695
Are we talking streaking?
Shall I disrobe?

14:30.739 --> 14:32.480
Huh?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.004
Mr. Frond?

14:35.048 --> 14:36.440
Aah! Huh?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.878
Are you stalking
Martini Tuesday?

14:38.921 --> 14:42.011
[laughing]: N-No.
That would be psychotic.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.318
Okay, I am. It's just... [sighs]

14:44.361 --> 14:45.928
...why didn't they invite me?

14:45.972 --> 14:48.061
Is that a rhetorical question
or...?

14:48.104 --> 14:49.932
Just because I don't drink
and I go to bed early

14:49.976 --> 14:51.586
and I told them all

14:51.629 --> 14:53.240
-I'm concerned
about their drinking.
-Uh-huh.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.155
They don't think
I'm cool enough?

14:55.198 --> 14:57.766
Well, would a guy who's not cool
enough go home every night

14:57.809 --> 15:00.203
and put on
Best Dance Music of the '90s

15:00.247 --> 15:01.944
and dance his little heart out?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.641
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.121
I know how we can distract...

15:05.165 --> 15:08.124
I mean, how you can show them
that you're cool.

15:08.168 --> 15:11.345
-You do? Wait, why are youhere?
-Let's focus on you.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.695
By any chance, do you have
any music with you now?

15:13.738 --> 15:15.131
Uh, you tell me.

15:15.175 --> 15:16.785
Oh, my God.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.830
TINA: Is that Mr. Frond?
What's Louise doing?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.484
Is she his dealer?

15:20.528 --> 15:21.964
You really think this will work?

15:22.008 --> 15:23.487
-I never said that.
-Wait, what?

15:23.531 --> 15:24.532
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.142
Just play the music, cool guy.
