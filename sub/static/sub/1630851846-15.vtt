WEBVTT

00:04.265 --> 00:06.049
Can I get a what's uuuuup?

00:06.093 --> 00:07.050
Can you get a what?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.834
No time for pleasantries, Steve.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.662
I've unsleeved the pudding pop.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.577
That's right.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.034
A lot of stuff has been going on
around here without my comment,

00:15.058 --> 00:16.842
and I think it's time to...

00:16.886 --> 00:18.844
...tell it like it is.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.021
That's right.
I tell it like it is.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.631
I call it like I see it.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.198
Do I pussyfoot around?

00:24.241 --> 00:25.242
I can't.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.637
It begins now.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.987
Hayley, you know
what I'm going to say.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.293
The bicycle shorts...

00:32.336 --> 00:34.077
The bicycle shorts
you wore last week.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.905
I didn't <i>see</i> a bicycle.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.298
Was it a fashion thing?

00:37.341 --> 00:38.666
With a baggy sweater,
I-I thought...

00:38.690 --> 00:40.170
It looked bad.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.129
Francine, I saw on
the credit card statement

00:42.172 --> 00:44.218
you got a subscription
to Master Class?

00:44.261 --> 00:46.133
Doris Kearns Goodwin does one...

00:46.176 --> 00:49.310
<i>You're</i> going to become
a DKG-level historian?

00:49.353 --> 00:50.896
That'd be the first time
anyone in this family

00:50.920 --> 00:52.400
followed through on something.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.576
Remember how you all saw
the movie <i>Nightcrawler</i>

00:54.619 --> 00:56.491
and you all wanted to become
Nightcrawlers,

00:56.534 --> 00:59.015
selling pictures
of car accidents to the news?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.799
How many of you
are Nightcrawlers now?

01:00.843 --> 01:02.758
We... We could...
We could be Nightcrawlers...

01:02.801 --> 01:04.412
Big mistake piping up, Steve.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.588
The other day, your hair
came down into your face?

01:06.631 --> 01:07.806
No.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.591
I was getting out of the pool!

01:09.634 --> 01:11.984
You don't have a face where
you can ever let your hair

01:12.028 --> 01:14.291
come forward like that.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.728
It's your nose.
Just telling it like it is.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.774
Talk to me about hair.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.645
Of all people.
Good gracious.

01:20.689 --> 01:21.994
What's that, son?

01:22.038 --> 01:23.822
Is it a hard truth
you're muttering?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.173
Hit me with it.
I can take it.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.871
I said it's funny for you
of all people

01:28.914 --> 01:30.438
to criticize someone's hair!

01:30.481 --> 01:31.569
You're bald!

01:31.613 --> 01:34.224
Bald... bald...

01:34.268 --> 01:35.443
Dad?

01:35.486 --> 01:36.618
Ooh!

01:36.661 --> 01:38.489
Bald! Bald! Bald!

01:38.533 --> 01:40.230
Bald! Bald!

01:40.274 --> 01:41.710
Pretty good Steve impression,
huh?

01:41.753 --> 01:43.059
Now do Klaus!

01:43.103 --> 01:44.930
What's up, dudes?

01:44.974 --> 01:47.281
Klaus usually says "bros."

01:49.892 --> 01:52.721

01:52.764 --> 01:56.551

02:20.052 --> 02:22.359
There I was,
blasting them with the truth,

02:22.403 --> 02:24.622
one of my best
tell-it-like-it-is-es-es,

02:24.666 --> 02:27.538
and Steve just knocks the wind
out of me with... with...

02:27.582 --> 02:28.800
The truth?

02:28.844 --> 02:30.019
Yes.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.369
Ya know, Stan, to tell it
like it is freely,

02:32.413 --> 02:34.763
you must remove
all your weaknesses.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.069
Baldness is my only weakness.

02:37.113 --> 02:39.289
You know, there's
a hair transplant technique

02:39.333 --> 02:41.422
I read about
that's very cutting edge...

02:41.465 --> 02:43.032
hair seeds.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.860
"Cutting edge" is intriguing.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.167
If you did it, I could arrange
to have your new hair

02:47.210 --> 02:48.907
styled by none other than...

02:48.951 --> 02:50.735
get ready for this...

02:50.779 --> 02:52.650
Josay Bosay.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.392
Who?

02:55.436 --> 02:56.785
Are you serious?

02:56.828 --> 02:58.178
Josay Bosay?

02:58.221 --> 03:00.789
He's my most celebrated
hair stylist character.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.269
I have never heard of him.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.488
Back in the '70s,
Josay gave Rod Stewart

03:04.532 --> 03:07.709
what would turn out to be
his forever haircut.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.058
You know what, Roger?

03:09.101 --> 03:11.191
I <i>will</i> get hair seeds!

03:11.234 --> 03:13.845
I'm so excited,
I have to journal!

03:13.889 --> 03:16.283
Is Stan right about us?

03:16.326 --> 03:18.763
We were so excited
about being Nightcrawlers.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.679
It's all we talked about
in 2015.

03:21.723 --> 03:24.856
But how many times did we
actually go out on the prowl?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.597
Not even once.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.991
Look, did you all like
the movie <i>Nightcrawler?</i>

03:29.034 --> 03:30.775
- Yes!
- More than anything.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.690
And do you still think
about it every day?

03:32.734 --> 03:34.475
- Yes!
- Morning to night!

03:34.518 --> 03:36.583
And do you think that taking
pictures of car accidents

03:36.607 --> 03:38.696
and crime scenes
seems like easy, fun money?

03:38.740 --> 03:39.958
Yes!

03:40.002 --> 03:41.177
Then get out there!

03:44.136 --> 03:46.226
No one ever uses
the fireman pole.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.141
Not even me.

03:51.622 --> 03:54.321
With my proprietary
hair seed technology,

03:54.364 --> 03:57.193
giving you a big, beautiful
mane of hair

03:57.237 --> 03:59.543
is as easy as one, two, three.

03:59.587 --> 04:02.459
Now, let's take the wig off
and see what we're working with.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.636
I can't do it.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.812
My... head's under there.

04:07.856 --> 04:08.857
I'm right here.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.206
I'm too nervous!

04:10.250 --> 04:13.253
What if I hold the other hand?

04:13.296 --> 04:14.819
And now...

04:16.038 --> 04:18.301
I'm a monster.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.303
It's okay, Mr. Smith.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.915
As a professional, I see
this sort of thing every day.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.787
Pamela, bring me some Dramamine.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.591
I'm looking at something
that makes me queasier

04:27.615 --> 04:29.269
than any roller coaster.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.880
These hair seeds
are gonna go nuclear

04:31.923 --> 04:34.796
when they touch down
on that cueball melon of yours.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.451
Let's gas this Kojak.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.453
I-I thought this was
an outpatient surgery.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.063
Shh.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.412
It's gonna be a breeze.

04:43.761 --> 04:47.243
Stan, things are going <i>
very</i> badly.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.593
Your body has rejected
the hair seeds,

04:49.637 --> 04:51.049
and something went nuts
with your kidneys.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.075
They swelled up
and got very big,

04:53.118 --> 04:54.816
then they shrunk down
very small,

04:54.859 --> 04:56.383
then they made a hissing sound,

04:56.426 --> 04:58.298
then they just
flat-out vanished.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.741
I saw the whole thing
on ultrasound.

04:59.777 --> 05:00.777
I was like...

05:02.780 --> 05:03.975
What does this mean for my hair?

05:03.999 --> 05:05.827
We need a rare double donor...

05:05.870 --> 05:08.525
both a kidney <i>and</i> a hair match.

05:08.569 --> 05:11.180
Fortunately, I already
found the right person.

05:11.223 --> 05:13.095
They're here,
they're excited to help,

05:13.138 --> 05:14.749
and they're right behind
this curtain.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.359
Looks like Tuttle.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.203
I'm going to insist
the donation be anonymous.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.536
This is an outrage!

05:19.580 --> 05:21.277
I'm a hero!

05:21.321 --> 05:23.714
Stay behind the screen.
It is my wish.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.325
Prep for surgery!

05:25.368 --> 05:29.024
Let's get hairy!

05:29.067 --> 05:30.852
- Aaaah!
- He's dead again?!

05:30.895 --> 05:32.767
This is a nightmare!

05:32.810 --> 05:34.812
My anesthesia's not working!

05:34.856 --> 05:36.640
My anesthesia's not working!

05:36.684 --> 05:38.033
Shut up! Shut up!

05:38.207 --> 05:40.165
Stan, open your eyes.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.256
It worked.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.780
- Hair?
- Oh, yeah.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.608
And it was easy as
one, two, three

05:47.651 --> 05:48.913
months in a coma.

05:48.957 --> 05:49.958
I was in a coma?!

05:50.001 --> 05:52.047
It's time to remove this towel

05:52.090 --> 05:54.179
and send you out into the world,

05:54.223 --> 05:55.920
a man who has hair,

05:55.964 --> 05:57.835
but no towel.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.402
The fruit...

05:59.446 --> 06:00.925
of the hair seed.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.102
Oh!

06:04.146 --> 06:05.626
Ohh!

06:05.669 --> 06:07.541
Ooh.

06:07.584 --> 06:10.239
I look like the Beast
from <i>Beauty and the Beast!</i>

06:10.282 --> 06:13.111
Now I get to bring you
to Josay Bosay

06:13.155 --> 06:14.939
for your first-ever haircut.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.941
I can't keep my hands out of it!

06:16.985 --> 06:19.335
I love seeing you
so happy, Stan.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.293
Anonymous! Anonymous!

06:27.169 --> 06:30.433
Uh, Stan Smith,
here for Josay Bosay?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.919
Naughty boy!

06:37.962 --> 06:41.879
Trying to read
my unfinished memoirs!

06:41.923 --> 06:44.752
There's some juicy stuff
in that memoir.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.319
When Morgan Fairchild reads
what I have to say

06:47.363 --> 06:50.714
about our hot affair,
she's going to be so very angry.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.934
But she gets horny
when she's angry,

06:52.977 --> 06:55.545
so more sex for me,
right, gorgeous?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.549
Th... These are scribbles.
Not writing.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.899
Oh, I can write.
And I can read, too.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.510
I read a book that
was one majillion,

07:03.553 --> 07:04.815
but let's talk hair.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.643
I want this haircut to be good.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.819
Rod was nervous, too,

07:08.863 --> 07:11.474
before I gave him <i>that.</i>

07:11.518 --> 07:13.389
Make me look like me.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.608
The most me.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.279
Et voilà!

07:34.323 --> 07:36.891
You just became...

07:36.934 --> 07:38.240
a butterfly.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.683
- I hate it.
- How's that, gorgeous?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.199
It's a horrible haircut.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.766
It's Rod Stewart's forever cut!

07:42.810 --> 07:44.333
It's an out-of-date hair-do.

07:44.376 --> 07:45.639
It's a hair-don't, frankly.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.469
I gotta tell it like it is.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.819
Josay Bosay, you're obviously

07:51.862 --> 07:53.864
nothing but
a washed-up dinosaur.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.040
He looks horrible.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.955
<i>You</i> look horrible.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.914
We all look horrible!

07:59.957 --> 08:02.090
This fool only knows
one haircut!

08:02.133 --> 08:05.223
It's official...
Josay Bosay is finished!

08:05.267 --> 08:07.704
To the hat store!

08:07.748 --> 08:10.315
Stan, what have you done?!

08:10.359 --> 08:11.708
I'm ruined!

08:11.752 --> 08:14.102
Josay Bosay is ruined!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.323
Hello, Josay Bosay salon,

08:18.367 --> 08:19.586
we're ruined.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.720
I need it fixed.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.548
Can the hair artists
at Fantastic Sam's

08:25.592 --> 08:27.332
guarantee total perfection?

08:29.030 --> 08:30.814
I-I'm sorry,
is someone crying on your end

08:30.858 --> 08:32.947
or is that coming from my house?

08:32.990 --> 08:34.949
Several people are crying there,
you say?

08:37.255 --> 08:40.911
Pube shapes are hot!

08:40.955 --> 08:44.524
Josay is no-o-o-ot!

08:44.567 --> 08:46.569
Terrible about Josay, isn't it?

08:46.613 --> 08:48.440
How you destroyed him?

08:48.484 --> 08:50.007
And after he stood by you

08:50.051 --> 08:52.575
during your difficult
hairplug recovery.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.924
Klaus, don't interact with me.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.622
I, uh... I... I don't know.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.145
I... I feel weird right now.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.364
You feel guilt, Stan.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.733
No, I think it's just
that earlier,

09:00.757 --> 09:02.672
I ate an entire hardshell crab

09:02.716 --> 09:04.282
like it was a softshell crab.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.806
Besides, why would I be guilty?

09:05.849 --> 09:07.547
I was only telling it
like it is.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.506
Stan, perhaps <i>I</i> can tell <i>you
like it is...</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:12.900
telling it like it is is mean!

09:12.943 --> 09:15.032
And when you're mean,
you feel guilty.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.730
And sometimes...

09:16.773 --> 09:19.776
it feels like you ate
the wrong kind of crab.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.909
Wow.
When you put it like that...

09:21.952 --> 09:23.737
Well, so, what am I
supposed to do?

09:23.780 --> 09:26.914
Support your friend
by lying to his face.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.524
Reverse all your positions.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.309
Say anything that will
make him feel good.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.660
Klaus, you're a genius
and I love you.

09:33.703 --> 09:34.878
You do?

09:34.922 --> 09:36.706
Whoa, lying's easy.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.882
I'm gonna go do it to Roger.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.364
- Roger?
- It's Josay!

09:42.407 --> 09:45.410
Look, Josay, I've been meaning
to say how sorry I am

09:45.454 --> 09:46.977
for what happened at your salon.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.892
<i>Former</i> salon.
You hated the cut.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.678
Wrong!
I love this haircut!

09:51.721 --> 09:53.767
Really?

09:53.810 --> 09:55.769
But the awful things you said...

09:55.812 --> 09:57.422
A misunderstanding.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.989
You called me out-of-date.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.382
Shyeah. Timeless!

10:00.425 --> 10:01.731
What about washed up?

10:01.775 --> 10:04.125
Washed <i>up.</i> Clean, tidy!

10:04.168 --> 10:05.474
Okay, I see that.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.997
And dinosaur?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.086
Like a T-rex.
He's the king, bud.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.091
Talk about
your misunderstandings!

10:14.135 --> 10:16.441
Now, I'm ecstatic you
like the cut,

10:16.485 --> 10:19.227
but if you want to maintain
that electrocuted bird look,

10:19.270 --> 10:21.533
you'll need to apply this
constantly.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.318
It's got a strong smell.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.015
What... is this?

10:25.059 --> 10:27.148
A little home recipe
I cooked up.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.715
It's starting to sting.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.281
It's very astringent.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.805
That's why I wear the gloves.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.937
It's hair-friendly,
not skin-friendly.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.939
Well, I... I love it.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.985
You know what?
I could sell this.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.943
It could be the key
to my comeback.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.007
I think a little's
getting in my...

10:41.031 --> 10:43.077
Ow!

10:43.120 --> 10:45.862
I mean... I mean wow!
This is great stuff.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.735
I just have to get people
to love it as much as you do!

10:48.778 --> 10:50.954
If that's even possible!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.829
Am I a lucky duck or what?

10:55.872 --> 10:58.048
I put out feelers that
I'm interested in

10:58.092 --> 11:01.269
starting my own product line,
wanna spend <i>lots</i> of money,

11:01.312 --> 11:04.141
and I'm immediately contacted
by Roz and Larry here

11:04.185 --> 11:06.535
to be my manufacturing partners!

11:06.578 --> 11:08.972
They're complete strangers,
but they have a nice house,

11:09.016 --> 11:12.062
and that makes me trust them
on a gut level.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.456
<i>Why</i> is the factory closed,
again?

11:14.499 --> 11:16.545
Oh, a skunk got in there.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.112
Pissed or whatever.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.722
Well, I'm convinced.

11:19.766 --> 11:23.683
Stan, is this a great idea
or is this a great idea?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.815
Or do you not like it
and think I'm a fool?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.904
Uh, it's... it's great.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.558
<i>- You're</i> great.
- Oh, excellent.

11:29.601 --> 11:32.909
Roz, Larry, here is a check
for the last of my money.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.738
Oh, great, but we can
do this later.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.914
Uhp!

11:37.958 --> 11:39.742
That's a good sign, right?

11:39.786 --> 11:42.049
- Eager to get started?
- Uh...

11:42.092 --> 11:44.616
Stan, they have
a very expensive home.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.922
They don't need my money.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.750
I think this is an open house.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.144
Could you both sign in?

11:50.187 --> 11:52.233
So, I've been getting
quite the runaround,

11:52.276 --> 11:54.539
but you're the right person
to help me stop a check?

11:54.583 --> 11:57.717
Well, I wrote a check
that was my entire life savings

11:57.760 --> 11:59.980
made out to cash earlier today,
and I'd like to...

12:00.023 --> 12:02.983
Stop! That! Check!

12:03.026 --> 12:05.289
Okay, thank you so much!
You're gorgeous!

12:05.333 --> 12:06.987
They cashed it hours ago.

12:08.858 --> 12:11.078
I'm a fool! A failure!

12:11.121 --> 12:12.949
I know you know it, Stan!

12:12.993 --> 12:15.299
Tell me like it is!

12:15.343 --> 12:17.693
Well, if you must know
the truth...

12:17.737 --> 12:18.999
No!
Keep lying, Stan!

12:19.042 --> 12:20.391
Wuzzat?

12:20.435 --> 12:21.871
The truth is...

12:21.915 --> 12:23.220
Lie, lie, lie!

12:23.264 --> 12:24.656
Wuzzat?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.397
You're a great hairdresser.

12:26.441 --> 12:27.964
Yes!

12:28.008 --> 12:30.358
Do you really think so?

12:30.401 --> 12:33.013
You're the greatest hairdresser
in the world.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.972
Do you mean the greatest now,

12:36.016 --> 12:37.669
or of all time?

12:37.713 --> 12:40.063
Um... all time.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.673
Including the future, too?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.066
How could I possibly know...

12:43.110 --> 12:44.676
Yes.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.243
Including the future, too.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.550
"The greatest hairdresser
of all time."

12:48.593 --> 12:49.943
I have to agree.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.683
You know, I think
we're in this mess

12:51.727 --> 12:53.424
because I forgot
it's about the hair,

12:53.468 --> 12:55.078
not this facocta product.

12:56.558 --> 13:00.170
So, if I want to get back
on top...

13:00.214 --> 13:03.783
I need to give Rod Stewart
a new forever haircut!

13:03.826 --> 13:05.349
That's what worked before!

13:05.393 --> 13:07.961
Oh, Rod's gonna be so excited!

13:08.004 --> 13:10.093
But I don't know how
to get in touch with him.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.486
Hmm...

13:11.529 --> 13:13.618
Aw, and it was
such a good idea...

13:13.662 --> 13:15.795
Oh, man!
Lucky duck alert!

13:15.838 --> 13:17.535
It's a picture of Rod.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.799
I-I can read the squiggles,

13:19.842 --> 13:22.497
but why don't you
read them to me?

13:22.540 --> 13:24.978
It says Rod's in town
for the grand opening

13:25.021 --> 13:27.110
of one of his incredible
stew restaurants,

13:27.154 --> 13:28.546
the Art of Stew

13:28.590 --> 13:30.766
by Rod Stew-Art.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.856
Rod Stewart is the same person
as Rod Stew-Art?!

13:33.900 --> 13:35.292
Yum, right?

13:35.336 --> 13:39.035
I can taste those big, hard
carrot pieces already.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.570
Restaurant opening is
in 15 minutes, Mr. Stewart.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.137
Eh, it's okay.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.705
They can't make the stew
without me.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.449
Surprise, Rod-baby!

14:01.492 --> 14:03.581
I'm sure sorry we snuck
into your limo, sir.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.061
I-I love your stews.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.063
Josay Bosay!

14:07.107 --> 14:09.587
Give us a kiss,
you cheeky bastard!

14:09.631 --> 14:10.937
Mwah!

14:10.980 --> 14:13.722
Josay, why has it been so long?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.221
Oh, I thought it was because
we were both

14:15.245 --> 14:17.900
after the smashing
Victoria Principal...

14:17.944 --> 14:20.729
legs for days, lot of cowlicks,
though, for a woman...

14:20.772 --> 14:23.863
and when she chose me,
I figured it ate you up inside.

14:23.906 --> 14:27.040
Josay, I-I thought
you were a homosexual?

14:27.083 --> 14:28.650
Oh, yeah.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.217
Anyway, Rod,
there's not much time.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.654
I'm very impressed
by all the success you've had

14:32.697 --> 14:34.351
with the stew restaurants.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.396
Mmmwah.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.311
What a great new chapter
for you.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.704
Speaking of new chapters,
I want one.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.881
And what better way
for me to have one

14:41.924 --> 14:44.448
than by giving you
a brand-new hairstyle

14:44.492 --> 14:46.842
to be revealed
at the grand opening

14:46.886 --> 14:48.931
of one of your suburban
stew restaurants?

14:48.975 --> 14:51.499
Seems like a strange plan.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.893
It's not.
It's a very good plan.

14:53.936 --> 14:56.069
Just ask Stan.
He's on board.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.462
The bloke with the great hair?

14:58.506 --> 14:59.899
That's Stan.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.075
My most supportive friend.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.164
Now, let's get cracking.

15:04.207 --> 15:06.166
Absolutely not, Bosay!

15:10.605 --> 15:12.955
Stan, he's not letting me do it!

15:14.000 --> 15:15.784
Stan, help!

15:26.708 --> 15:28.405
Did we just kidnap Rod Stewart?

15:28.449 --> 15:29.841
Yes, you did!

15:29.885 --> 15:31.191
Okay, that's one vote.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.978
<i>Greg, here's what we know...</i>

15:36.022 --> 15:38.589
<i>We know Rod Stewart's limousine
was hijacked</i>

15:38.633 --> 15:41.244
<i>at the opening
of his new stew restaurant.</i>

15:41.288 --> 15:45.161
<i>We know his stews are really
flavorful, very rich.</i>

15:45.205 --> 15:46.510
<i>We know Rod Stewart is...</i>

15:46.554 --> 15:48.469
<i>I want to say Australian?</i>

15:48.512 --> 15:51.341
<i>As you can see, the police
have them well-surrounded.</i>

15:51.385 --> 15:52.908
<i>I imagine whoever is in there</i>

15:52.952 --> 15:55.998
<i>cannot feel too good
about their prospects.</i>

15:56.042 --> 15:57.565
I'm feeling good about this.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.741
Let's cut your hair
and become fabulous together.

15:59.784 --> 16:00.785
Again.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.136
Josay, please stop the limo.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.007
I'm scared for all our lives.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.574
Roger, what's happening
back there?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.619
The headline is
"I'm feeling good."

16:08.663 --> 16:09.969
Rod's warming up.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.275
His eyes aren't doing
as much fearful darting.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.885
Few more laps around
the ol' highway

16:13.929 --> 16:15.209
and I think
he'll let me cut him.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.453
Oh, dear.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.373
And here they come
to get their pictures,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.375
those disgusting,
scum-sucking...

16:25.419 --> 16:27.856
Nightcrawlers!

16:27.899 --> 16:30.467
If the kidnappers are a bunch
of babes with big ones,

16:30.511 --> 16:32.600
we could be looking at 50 Gs.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.211
- Yeahhh.
- We gotta get closer.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.778
If Rod Stewart is killed

16:36.821 --> 16:38.519
and we're not there
to get the picture,

16:38.562 --> 16:41.435
well, then, are we even
loathsome Nightcrawlers at all?

16:44.481 --> 16:46.396
Could be a shootout.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.225
Might crash.
Might fireball. Yeah.

16:49.269 --> 16:50.879
Might fireball, boom. Boom!

16:50.922 --> 16:53.621
Look! We can get from
the off-ramp to the on-ramp,

16:53.664 --> 16:56.363
blow right past the police line.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.539
Fireball!

16:58.582 --> 17:00.932
Punch it, punch it,
punch it, yeah, yeah!

17:00.976 --> 17:01.977
Nowwww...

17:02.021 --> 17:03.631
punch it!

17:03.674 --> 17:05.807
- Noooo!
- You said punch it!

17:05.850 --> 17:07.678
The last one I switched it
to mean brake!

17:07.722 --> 17:08.984
Punch the brake!

17:11.378 --> 17:14.598
Those gotdamt Nightcrawlers!

17:14.642 --> 17:16.905
Nightcrawlers,
desperate for magic footage

17:16.948 --> 17:19.603
of a celebrity death,
have caused an accident.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.519
Their pursuit of senselessly
gratuitous coverage

17:22.563 --> 17:25.696
sickens me to the very core
of my journalistic integrity.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.047
- Should we cut the feed?
- Don't be a nitwit.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.700
What if there's a fireball?

17:32.312 --> 17:34.923
Rod, pleeeeease!

17:34.966 --> 17:36.533
No!

17:38.840 --> 17:39.841
Bla-dow!

17:46.456 --> 17:48.328
It's time to give up!

17:50.765 --> 17:52.549
Oh, good, you're coming back.

17:52.593 --> 17:55.117
I forgot to tell you,
Roz and Larry reached out.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.902
It was a misunderstanding,
but to get me my money back,

17:57.946 --> 17:59.469
they needed my
social security number.

17:59.513 --> 18:00.688
Great news, right?

18:00.731 --> 18:02.733
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

18:02.777 --> 18:04.692
I felt guilty
and I overcorrected,

18:04.735 --> 18:07.260
but all this lying to be nice
has made everything terrible!

18:07.303 --> 18:09.958
Terrible? In what way?

18:10.001 --> 18:12.874
I have no choice now
but to tell you like it is.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.660
Only this time, I'm going
to try to add in...

18:16.704 --> 18:18.227
some kindness.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.489
Okay.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.143
I'm scared, but I'm ready.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.103
You're an ass.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.975
Your mind is an explosive
source of shitty ideas,

18:27.018 --> 18:28.542
and all to do what?

18:28.585 --> 18:30.631
Revive a career that didn't
matter to begin with?

18:30.674 --> 18:32.720
You're a terrible stylist.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.722
Aside from a total
lack of taste,

18:34.765 --> 18:36.550
you're also just not
a good haircutter,

18:36.593 --> 18:37.899
on a craftsman level.

18:37.942 --> 18:38.987
Scissor skills are zero.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.945
Everyone knows
you're illiterate,

18:40.989 --> 18:43.349
so it's excruciating when you
keep showing people your book,

18:43.383 --> 18:46.037
or pretend to sit down
with that big quill pen.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.885
- Your breath...
- The... The kindness, please?

18:47.909 --> 18:49.650
When is it? When is it?!

18:49.693 --> 18:52.261
You...

18:52.305 --> 18:56.047
make me feel bad when I say
how awful you are at everything.

18:56.091 --> 18:59.181
Because you're nice to me.

18:59.225 --> 19:02.445
You make me wish I thought
you were a better man.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.794
Wow.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.231
Yeah.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.188
But you're not.

19:06.232 --> 19:09.148
Sweet Maggie May,

19:09.191 --> 19:12.412
both of you are trying
so hard to change, to grow.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.284
And maybe I've been
stuck in a rut myself.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.721
Josay... let's do it.

19:17.765 --> 19:20.594
This has been a long time
coming, Roddy-boy.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.205
Eh, the haircut.
L-Let's do the haircut.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.815
I'm horny for that, too.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.078
Seems like someone
should sing...

19:27.122 --> 19:28.776
I hadn't prepared...

19:28.819 --> 19:31.605
It's me!

19:31.648 --> 19:35.522

They kidnapped Rod!

20:15.083 --> 20:16.171
Murder them!

20:24.135 --> 20:27.313
It's... It's not Rod Stewart.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.533
It's some old skeleton with
a different out-of-date haircut.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.143
It's the Clooney!

20:32.187 --> 20:33.971
Rod Stewart isn't here!

20:34.015 --> 20:36.104
And maybe he never even existed!

20:36.147 --> 20:37.453
Let's go home!

20:41.283 --> 20:43.764
Rod, you may have noticed
some similarities

20:43.807 --> 20:45.592
between the song
I sang in the limo

20:45.635 --> 20:47.550
and your song "Forever Young."

20:47.594 --> 20:49.813
Yeah, kind of.
Great.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.946
Then you'll understand
why I'm suing you.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.864
Have a great night!
