IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.808 --> 00:09.410
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

00:09.443 --> 00:11.479
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.248
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.282 --> 00:16.084
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.117 --> 00:17.418
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.451 --> 00:19.253
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.289
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.492
- WHAT DO YOU DO
IF IT GOES TO VOICE MAIL?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.094
- I LEAVE A MESSAGE.
- AND?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.295
both: TEXT.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.830
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M LETTING YOU

00:29.863 --> 00:31.065
GO TO SCHOOL
ON YOUR OWN.

00:31.099 --> 00:34.102
- EVERYBODY ELSE IN FOURTH GRADE
GOES TO SCHOOL ON THEIR OWN.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.137
- WHO?
THE GENTILES, THE JEWS?

00:36.170 --> 00:38.639
THOSE GADJOS
DON'T LOVE THEIR CHILDREN.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.174
- MOM, I STICK
OUT ENOUGH AS IT IS.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.611
CAN I GO NOW?

00:43.644 --> 00:45.846
- [sighs]

00:45.879 --> 00:50.251
YOUR MITTENS.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.852
WHAT DID YOUR FATHER
TELL YOU?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.487
- TAKE THE "G" TRAIN,
THEN THE "J" TO MANHATTAN,

00:53.521 --> 00:55.089
TWO BLOCKS UP AND ONE OVER.

00:55.123 --> 00:58.759
I KNOW, MA.
I LOVE YOU.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.828
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.559
DAD, STOP FOLLOWING ME.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.261
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT CROSSING THE STREET

02:07.295 --> 02:08.562
WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE A WALK SIGN?

02:08.596 --> 02:09.830
- DAD, I'M READY.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.501
LET ME DO IT, OKAY?

02:13.534 --> 02:16.537
- OKAY, BIG BOY.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.527
[school bell rings]

02:39.560 --> 02:41.929
- GOOD MORNING, SARAH.
HOW ARE YOU?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.397
HAVE A GOOD DAY, TODAY.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.465
HEY, NICO.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.434
GOOD MORNING.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.402
- HEY.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.603
YOU TELL FORTUNES, RIGHT?

02:49.637 --> 02:50.604
- NO.

02:50.638 --> 02:51.772
- THOUGHT ALL
YOU FREAKS DID.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.841
- I DO.

02:53.874 --> 02:54.942
I SEE...

02:54.975 --> 02:57.745
A LONG LIFELINE,
A MANSION, AND--

02:57.778 --> 02:59.347
WHAT'S THIS?

[bell rings]

03:03.517 --> 03:07.588
SEE ME AFTER CLASS.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.889
GET TO CLASS, NICO.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.858
- [sighs]

SOMETIMES.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.438
HEY, YOU'RE FLYING SOLO
TODAY, CHAMPION?

03:24.472 --> 03:27.708
- WE PRACTICED.
I KNOW THE WAY.

[dramatic music]

04:04.812 --> 04:12.820
*

04:49.857 --> 04:51.492
- TEN-YEAR-OLD GYPSY BOY--
NICO GREY--

04:51.525 --> 04:53.093
HIS PARENTS SAY
HE NEVER MADE IT HOME

04:53.126 --> 04:54.462
FROM CASWELL ACADEMY.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.398
- AND YOU CALLED
MANHATTAN SVU BECAUSE?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.368
- LAST TIME ANYBODY SAW
THE KID WAS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.970
3:30 P.M.,
LOWER EAST SIDE, MANHATTAN.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.972
YOUR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.576
YOU KNOW WHAT, THESE PEOPLE
DON'T REALLY TRUST OUR PRECINCT.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.344
- MAYBE THEY DON'T LIKE BEING
CALLED, "THESE PEOPLE"

05:10.378 --> 05:11.945
OR "GYPSIES" EVEN.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.046
- MAYBE.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.915
IF YOU ASK ME,
THE KID'S NOT MISSING.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.385
IT'S ALL JUST A CON.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.452
[horn honks]

05:18.486 --> 05:20.854
- OH, LOOK.
THE CIRCUS IS HERE.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.556
I WONDER WHO CALLED THEM.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.693
- HEY, DETECTIVES.
ANY WORD ON LITTLE NICO?

05:25.726 --> 05:30.831
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM,
WE'LL TAKE THE PARENTS.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.433
- HE WANTED TO DO IT
ON HIS OWN.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.101
BE A MAN,
STAND ON HIS OWN TWO FEET.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.937
- SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
NICO GOES TO SCHOOL ON HIS OWN.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.839
- YEAH, WE PRACTICED
FOR A WEEK.

05:38.872 --> 05:42.075
WHICH TRAIN TO GET ON,
WHAT TO DO IF A STRANGER--

05:42.109 --> 05:43.444
YOU KNOW,
TAUGHT HIM A FEW MOVES.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.446
- YOUR BOY SHOULD
HAVE BEEN HERE BY 4:00,

05:45.479 --> 05:46.614
BUT WE DIDN'T
GET A CALL BY 7:00.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.749
- YEAH, I TOLD MY WIFE
TO CALL RIGHT AWAY.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.618
SHE SAID THE POLICE
PROBABLY WOULDN'T CARE

05:50.651 --> 05:51.852
BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.587
- HE WAS WEARING
A LIGHT BROWN JACKET,

05:53.621 --> 05:58.592
A TAN SCARF, AND A BACKPACK
WITH A RABBIT'S FOOT.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.994
IT'S HIS GOOD LUCK CHARM.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.996
WE BOUGHT HIM
A CELL PHONE.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.466
I--I KEEP CALLING,
BUT HE--HE DOESN'T ANSWER.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.769
- OKAY, WHO WAS
THE LAST PERSON TO SEE NICO?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.604
- HIS TEACHER,
MR. KANDEL.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.105
- DID YOU CHECK
WITH NICO'S FRIENDS?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.842
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
HE'S WITH ONE OF THEM?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.844
- NICO DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS.

06:16.877 --> 06:21.415
AT SCHOOL,
THEY...BULLY HIM.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.084
- HE TESTED REAL GOOD.
HE'S A SMART KID.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.086
GOT A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP
TO THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL

06:26.119 --> 06:28.155
IN THE CITY.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.724
WE WANTED NICO TO BE WITH
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT KIDS.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.059
NOT JUST ROMANI.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.126
- MR. GREY,

06:33.160 --> 06:34.495
HOW WERE THINGS AT HOME?

06:34.528 --> 06:36.430
IS NICO UPSET
ABOUT ANYTHING LATE--

06:36.464 --> 06:37.465
- NO.

06:37.498 --> 06:40.734
HE'S A HAPPY KID.
A GOOD KID.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.203
- WHAT ABOUT
A FAVORITE HANGOUT?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.740
SOME PLACE
HE LIKES TO GO?

06:46.774 --> 06:50.944
- YOU'RE IN IT.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.448
- WE'RE ALL DISTRAUGHT,

06:54.482 --> 06:57.084
AND NICO
IS SUCH A SWEET KID.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.787
I REMEMBER SEEING HIM
JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING SCHOOL.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.921
- WAS HE ALONE?

07:00.954 --> 07:01.789
- HE'S ALWAYS ALONE.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.024
THE KIDS TEASE HIM
FOR BEING ROMANI.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.694
UH, WE TOLD THEM NOT
TO USE THE WORD, "GYPSY."

07:06.727 --> 07:07.528
- OKAY.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.062
SO WHAT'S YOUR TAKE
ON THE PARENTS?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.464
- DIFFERENT.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.865
- DO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANY TROUBLE AT HOME?

07:11.899 --> 07:12.866
- WHO KNOWS?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.568
THEY KEEP
TO THEMSELVES.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.969
NICO JUST
WANTS TO FIT IN,

07:16.003 --> 07:18.205
BUT HE'S CAUGHT
BETWEEN TWO WORLDS.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.641
- SO YOU TWO
ARE FRIENDS OF NICO'S?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.610
- WE JUST LIVE
ON THE SAME BLOCK.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.878
GREENPOINT.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.780
HE'S KIND OF WEIRD.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.215
- HE'S A GYPSY.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.850
HIS MOM'S
A FORTUNE TELLER.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.852
- THINK SHE WOULD'VE
SEEN THIS COMING. [laughs]

07:31.885 --> 07:33.487
- AND YOUR NAME IS?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.489
- RYAN.
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.857
- OKAY, RYAN.
CHILL.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.159
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW NICO?

07:39.192 --> 07:40.561
- THAT MORNING.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.696
- YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM
ON THE TRAIN RIDE HOME?

07:42.730 --> 07:45.098
- NO, THE "J" WAS DOWN.
WE TOOK A TAXI.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.900
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, RYAN?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.702
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.871
- I DIDN'T.
I WAS IN DETENTION.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.607
- WE CAN TRACK HIM
FROM SCHOOL ON HIS ROUTE

07:53.641 --> 07:54.441
TO THE SUBWAY.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.744
THEN HE GETS
TO THE CLOSED STATION--

07:56.777 --> 07:57.745
AND WE LOSE HIM.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.747
TIME STAMP IS 3:37.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.715
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT'S 11 HOURS AGO.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.283
YOU DID A FULL
NEIGHBORHOOD CANVASS?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.853
- WE RAN ALL
THE SEX OFFENDERS IN THE AREA.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.220
NO WITNESSES,
NO LEADS.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.722
- AND ONLINE?

08:08.756 --> 08:09.857
I MEAN,
HOW ABOUT HIS COMPUTER?

08:09.890 --> 08:10.991
- THE KID
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ONE.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.993
DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.228
HIS FATHER JUST BOUGHT HIM
HIS FIRST CELL PHONE THIS WEEK,

08:15.262 --> 08:17.264
SO HE COULD GET BACK
AND FORTH FROM SCHOOL.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.867
TARU'S TRYING TO TRACE THAT,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING SO FAR.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.870
- SO THEY'RE NOT ONLY OLD WORLD,
THEY'RE ROMANI.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.739
AFTER 600 YEARS
OF BEING TREATED LIKE PARIAHS,

08:25.773 --> 08:27.274
THEY DON'T TRUST OUTSIDERS.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.475
PARENTS HAVE A RECORD?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.945
- TOMAS GREY WAS ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULT THREE MONTHS AGO.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.847
HE GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION
WITH A CO-WORKER,

08:33.881 --> 08:35.916
ALONSO HEARNE,
AT HIS BIKE SHOP.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.718
GUY DROPPED THE CHARGES.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.052
- WELL,
MAYBE IT'S PAYBACK.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.622
CHECK WITH THE PRECINCT
IN BROOKLYN.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.293
- TOMAS ISN'T IN.
FAMILY EMERGENCY.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.895
- YOU MEAN
HIS SON'S MISSING.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.162
- KID'S NOT HERE.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.263
GO AHEAD AND CHECK.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.600
- THE FIGHT YOU HAD
WITH TOMAS THREE MONTHS AGO--

08:52.633 --> 08:54.635
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

08:54.668 --> 08:55.636
- TOMAS HAS TROUBLE.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.071
HE BROUGHT
THIS ON HIMSELF.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.173
- DETECTIVE DUMAS.
THEY CALL ME, "DOOM."

09:00.207 --> 09:00.974
WELCOME TO BROOKLYN.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.611
I HEARD YOU NEEDED
A TOUR GUIDE.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.745
HEY, AL.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.114
- YOUR FRIEND HERE--
HE'S RETICENT.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.749
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.817
- WELL, THINK HARDER.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.884
AND MAYBE
WHILE YOU'RE THINKING,

09:10.918 --> 09:12.252
I'LL GO OVER
EVERY BIKE IN HERE

09:12.285 --> 09:13.921
TO MAKE SURE
NONE OF THEM GOT SEPARATED

09:13.954 --> 09:15.188
FROM A CHAIN
BY ACCIDENT.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.824
- TAKE WHAT YOU WANT.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.892
YOU PEOPLE
CALL US THIEVES.

09:18.926 --> 09:19.993
- WE KNOW YOU'RE THIEVES.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.731
WE WANNA KNOW
IF THIS IS A SCAM.

09:23.764 --> 09:28.936
YOUR FRIEND, TOMAS--
DID HE STEAL HIS OWN KID?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.171
- LAST CHANCE, ALONSO.

09:31.204 --> 09:35.876
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA EVEN LIE TO US?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.377
[sighs]

09:37.410 --> 09:40.648
THIS GOTTA BE ABOUT
THE ROM BARO, ISN'T IT?

09:40.681 --> 09:44.117
IS THAT WHO'S GOT
YOUR TONGUE?

09:44.151 --> 09:47.220
- WHAT THE HELL
IS A ROM BARO?

09:47.254 --> 09:50.924
- SO THIS ROM BARO WORKS
FOR THE KING OF THE GYPSIES?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.092
- RIGHT.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.962
THE KING LIVES IN HUNGARY
OR SERBIA OR WHEREVER-STAN.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.697
THE ROM BARO LIVES HERE.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.999
AS THE KING'S REP,
HE SETTLES DISPUTES,

09:59.032 --> 10:00.033
COLLECTS TITHES--

10:00.067 --> 10:01.034
- AND GETS KICKBACKS.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.335
- YEAH.
IT'S GOOD TO BE KING.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.172
- AND I'M BETTING THE ROM BARO
GETS A LITTLE TASTE.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.239
- YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.075
YOUR PARTNER'S
PRETTY AND SMART.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.243
- ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU
YOU TALK TOO MUCH?

10:10.277 --> 10:13.981
- [laughs]

10:14.014 --> 10:15.048
- WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?
ALONSO?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.416
THAT GUY JUST
LOOKS OUT FOR HIMSELF.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.352
- LOOK, IF THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT SOMEBODY TOOK NICO

10:19.386 --> 10:20.854
TO GET BACK AT YOU,
WE NEED TO KNOW.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.723
- LOOK, THIS GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE ROM BARO.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.657
- YOUR SON'S MISSING.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.693
AND EVERY MINUTE
YOU DON'T LEVEL WITH US,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.427
IS ANOTHER MINUTE
HE'S OUT THERE, SCARED.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.428
AND THAT'S
THE BEST CASE.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.999
- YOU DIDN'T PAY.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.033
YOU DIDN'T PAY!

10:33.066 --> 10:35.302
I KNEW SOMETHING LIKE THIS
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.870
- WHAT'S GOING ON,
MRS. GREY?

10:36.904 --> 10:39.940
- YOU TELL THEM.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.910
YOU TELL THEM!

10:42.943 --> 10:45.445
- WE STOPPED PAYING
OUR TITHES

10:45.478 --> 10:49.082
SO THAT WE COULD PAY
FOR NICO'S SCHOOL.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.819
THE ROM BARO--
HE SAID THAT--

10:51.852 --> 10:55.756
THAT THIS WOULD NOT STAND.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.091
THAT WE HAD TO BE PUNISHED.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.126
- [sighs]

11:16.209 --> 11:18.311
- CAN I OFFER YOU
SOME PáLIKA?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.914
- NO, THANK YOU.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.986
- DO YOU KNOW
THE GREY FAMILY?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.422
- FROM MESEROLE STREET.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.291
YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND THEIR SON?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.426
- NICO.
YOU KNOW HIM?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.395
- BRIGHT BOY.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.830
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

11:36.864 --> 11:39.166
- THE GREYS--
THEY DON'T ASSOCIATE

11:39.199 --> 11:42.269
WITH THE COMMUNITY
MUCH ANYMORE.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.804
- HOW SO?

11:43.837 --> 11:45.906
- IF THE GREYS
WANT TO BE OUTSIDERS,

11:45.939 --> 11:47.775
THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE--
OUTSIDE.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.110
THEY'LL FIND OUT WHAT
IT'S LIKE WITHOUT A FAMILY

11:50.143 --> 11:51.879
TO PROTECT THEM.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.146
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.315
ARE YOU USING THE KID
TO MAKE THEM PAY YOU?

11:55.348 --> 11:58.151
- I WOULD NEVER
HURT A CHILD.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.452
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK,

11:59.486 --> 12:01.321
BUT NYPD ISN'T JUST GOING
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY

12:01.354 --> 12:02.489
BECAUSE THIS KID'S ROMANI.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.924
WE'RE GOING TO FIND HIM.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.493
- YEAH, I KNOW
YOU WOULD NEVER HURT A CHILD.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.863
I'M HOPING
THAT WE FIND HIM SAFE,

12:09.897 --> 12:13.801
AND THAT THIS IS JUST
A FAMILY MISUNDERSTANDING.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.368
WE THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.840
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A HAPPY ENDING
I'D LIKE TO SEE.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.009
- [laughs]

12:22.042 --> 12:26.113
MUST BE NICE
TO BELIEVE IN HAPPY ENDINGS,

12:26.146 --> 12:28.782
BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.783
OR THE GREYS.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.485
[breathes deeply]

12:32.519 --> 12:34.321
MAKE SURE THEY GET
AN ALMOND CANDY

12:34.354 --> 12:38.258
ON THE WAY OUT, ELBA.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.802
- WE BROUGHT UP
THE ROM BARO WITH THE GREYS.

12:48.836 --> 12:49.937
THEY'RE TERRIFIED OF HIM.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.039
- HE SAYS THE GREYS
ARE OUTCASTS.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.341
- IS THERE ANY CHANCE
HE TOOK THE KID?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.508
- I WOULDN'T RULE IT OUT,

12:55.542 --> 12:57.878
BUT NOBODY IN HIS FIEFDOM
IS GOING TO GO AGAINST HIM.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.813
- DETECTIVES,
HE'S ALIVE!

12:59.847 --> 13:01.048
HE'S OUT THERE!

13:01.081 --> 13:02.983
- MR. GREY, SLOW DOWN.
YOU HEARD FROM NICO?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.117
- WE'VE BEEN CALLING
NICO'S CELL PHONE

13:04.151 --> 13:05.452
EVERY FIVE MINUTES,
PRACTICALLY--

13:05.485 --> 13:08.088
LEAVING TONS OF MESSAGES,
BEGGING HIM TO CALL--

13:08.121 --> 13:09.556
- HOLD ON.
DID--DID HE CALL YOU BACK?

13:09.589 --> 13:10.858
- NO, LISTEN TO ME.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.459
THE LAST TIME
MY WIFE TRIED TO CALL,

13:12.492 --> 13:14.161
IT SAID, "MAILBOX FULL."

13:14.194 --> 13:16.496
JUST NOW, IT WENT
STRAIGHT TO VOICE MAIL.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.466
HE'S BEEN CHECKING
HIS MESSAGES, DELETING THEM.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.534
HE IS ALIVE.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.371
- [sighs]

13:31.244 --> 13:32.012
- I'VE GOT
NICO'S CELL PHONE RECORDS.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.546
HIS LAST CALL
WAS TO HIS FATHER,

13:33.580 --> 13:36.083
7:30 THE MORNING
HE DISAPPEARED.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.985
PHONE'S BEEN SHUT OFF
SINCE THAT MORNING.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.286
- IT'S BEEN SHUT OFF?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.454
- MAYBE IT'S NOT NICO
CHECKING HIS VOICE MAIL.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.390
MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE
IS DELETING THEM.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.591
- WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.459
- THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE FAMILY KNOWS.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.627
IS THERE
ANY WAY TO TRACE

13:47.660 --> 13:49.062
WHOEVER'S CALLING
INTO HIS VOICE MAIL?

13:49.096 --> 13:50.397
- OOH, THANK YOU,

13:50.430 --> 13:52.199
I NEVER WOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT ONE.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.134
- OKAY,
THE ONLY PROBLEM HERE

13:54.167 --> 13:56.169
IS THAT IT'S NOT
COMING FROM A PHONE NUMBER.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.271
IT'S COMING FROM
AN IP ADDRESS.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.507
WHOEVER'S CALLING
THE KID'S VOICE MAIL

14:00.540 --> 14:02.976
IS DOING
IT FROM A V.O.I.P.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.477
- HOW ABOUT IN NON-GEEK?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.014
- IT MEANS HE'S USING
THE INTERNET TO CALL, FIN,

14:07.047 --> 14:08.048
NOT A PHONE LINE.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.249
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.284
- FROM AN ACCOUNT
SET UP AN HOUR

14:11.318 --> 14:13.453
AFTER THE BOY
WAS REPORTED MISSING.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.088
- THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.356
SO WHERE IS THIS COMPUTER?

14:16.389 --> 14:18.158
- IT'S GOTTA BE A LAPTOP.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.994
HE'S BEEN CATCHING SIGNALS
WHEREVER HE CAN.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.195
- ARE THERE
ANY OTHER NUMBERS

14:22.229 --> 14:23.964
THAT HE'S
BEEN CALLING REGULARLY?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.132
YOU CAN LOOK
THAT UP, RIGHT?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.200
- OH, A "PLEASE"
WOULD BE NICE.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.201
- TYPE.

14:28.235 --> 14:33.006
- OKAY, ONLY ONE OTHER NUMBER
ONCE YESTERDAY,

14:33.040 --> 14:34.607
TWICE TODAY.

14:34.641 --> 14:40.213
A 5-43,
6-20

14:40.247 --> 14:42.182
AND...

14:42.215 --> 14:43.216
BOOM.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.386
THERE'S YOUR ADDRESS.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.220
[camera shutter clicks]

14:48.521 --> 14:50.523
- YOU HAVE
AN ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.492
- YES.
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

14:52.525 --> 14:53.961
- LOOK, WE NEED TO SEE
YOUR DELIVERY RECORDS

14:53.994 --> 14:56.629
FOR TONIGHT.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.465
THANK YOU.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.100
[clicks mouse]

15:00.133 --> 15:01.434
HERE IT IS.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.236
5-43--

15:03.270 --> 15:05.105
SAME ADDRESS AGAIN--

15:05.138 --> 15:06.073
IT'S 6-20--WHAT?
HE ORDERED TWICE?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.976
- NO, HE CALLED
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE ORDER.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.245
SAID THE FOOD WAS TOO SPICY
FOR HIS LITTLE BOY.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.248
I COULD HEAR THE KID
CRYING IN THE BACKGROUND.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.283
- [sighs]
THANK YOU.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.294
- POLICE!

15:27.327 --> 15:29.429
NYPD, SEARCH WARRANT!

15:29.462 --> 15:30.497
GET YOUR HANDS UP!

15:30.530 --> 15:32.099
- DON'T SHOOT,
DON'T SHOOT!

15:32.132 --> 15:34.001
- DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
PUT THAT KID DOWN.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.002
- WHAT THE BLOODY HELL
IS GOING ON?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.436
- YOUR HANDS UP!

15:36.469 --> 15:37.637
- DON'T HURT MY DADDY!

15:37.670 --> 15:38.638
- HE'S MY SON,
HE'S MY SON!

15:38.671 --> 15:40.173
- STAND DOWN,
STAND DOWN!

15:40.207 --> 15:43.510
- IT'S NOT NICO.
AMARO, IT'S NOT NICO.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.345
- GET SOMEONE
TO WATCH YOUR KID.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.346
- IT'S OKAY.

15:46.379 --> 15:51.084
- YOU'RE COMING
WITH US.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.021
- MY CLIENT IS A
SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST

15:54.054 --> 15:55.022
FOR THE LEDGER.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.757
HIS HOME WAS INVADED,
HIS SON WAS TERRORIZED.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.760
- AFTER HE HACKED INTO
A MISSING CHILD'S VOICE MAIL.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.230
NOW WE CAN EITHER GO TO THE FEDS
WITH THE WIRETAPPING,

16:03.263 --> 16:07.100
OR YOUR CLIENT CAN COOPERATE.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.736
- YOU START BY TELLING US
IF YOU KNOW WHERE NICO GREY IS.

16:09.769 --> 16:10.903
- I DON'T.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.474
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO FIND
POOR LITTLE NICO JUST LIKE YOU.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.377
- HOW DOES DELETING
HIS MESSAGES HELP YOU FIND HIM?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.412
- I WANTED TO LEAVE ROOM
IN HIS MAILBOX

16:19.446 --> 16:21.481
IN CASE ANYONE ELSE
WANTED TO CALL HIM.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.384
MAYBE SOMEONE RELATED
TO HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.186
- SO YOU'RE NOT A SCUMBAG
WHO'S TRYING TO SCOOP

16:26.219 --> 16:28.788
THE COMPETITION
ON A MILK CARTON CASE.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.624
YOU ARE
ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.260
- DETECTIVE,
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

16:33.293 --> 16:35.562
MR. GRISCOMB HAS BEEN
A JOURNALIST FOR 15 YEARS.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.729
- JOURNALIST?
THE LEDGER?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.031
THAT'S RISIBLE.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.666
- EXCUSE ME,
DOES HE HAVE TO BE HERE?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.501
- MR. GRISCOMB,
WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE NOTES

16:41.534 --> 16:43.070
YOU HAVE
ON THE DELETED MESSAGES.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.604
- THAT'S COVERED
BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.240
- OH, SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO
HIDE BEHIND THE FIRST AMENDMENT?

16:47.274 --> 16:49.709
- YOU LED A FAMILY TO BELIEVE
THAT THEIR SON WAS STILL ALIVE.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.244
- OBVIOUSLY,
THAT WASN'T THE POINT.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.213
- OKAY, ARE WE FINISHED
WITH THIS MORAL OUTRAGE,

16:53.246 --> 16:54.214
SERGEANT?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.349
WE ALL WANT TO FIND
THIS MISSING LITTLE BOY,

16:56.383 --> 16:57.584
AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,

16:57.617 --> 16:59.086
MY CLIENT
HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER,

16:59.119 --> 17:00.487
SO, SWEETHEART,
DO ME A FAVOR.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.122
WHY DON'T
YOU CALL YOUR BOSS?

17:02.155 --> 17:05.458
- A.D.A. CABOT.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.659
- YOU WANT A DEAL?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.761
YOUR CLIENT TELLS US
WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW,

17:08.795 --> 17:09.762
AND HE DOES TIME.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.765
- AND HOW MUCH
IS UP TO YOU.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.601
- WHAT LEDGER
WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE

17:14.634 --> 17:15.468
THAN TO HAVE A TEST CASE

17:15.502 --> 17:18.238
INVOLVING
FIRST AMENDMENT AND NYPD.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.239
PLEASE, GO AHEAD.
TRY US.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.673
- YOU THREE ARE PLAYING THIS

17:20.707 --> 17:22.242
WHILE THERE'S
A MISSING KID OUT THERE?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.344
- YEAH, LET'S CUT
TO THE CHASE, MR. EXLEY.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.513
- OKAY, GRISCOMB GIVES YOU
EVERYTHING HE HAS

17:26.546 --> 17:27.747
ON THE MISSING BOY'S
PHONE RECORDS,

17:27.780 --> 17:29.516
HE GETS FULL IMMUNITY
FROM PROSECUTION.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.084
- NO, THIS IS
HOW IT WORKS.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.720
WIRETAPPING IS FEDERAL.
IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.622
HE GIVES US SOMETHING
WE CAN USE,

17:35.655 --> 17:39.192
WE'LL MIS-DEE
THE FELONY EAVESDROPPING.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.627
TAKE A MINUTE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.728
- [sighs]

17:41.761 --> 17:45.398
- AND BY A MINUTE,
I MEAN 59 SECONDS.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.834
- THE DELETED MESSAGES
WERE ALL FROM THE PARENTS.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.470
I ALSO TAPPED
INTO THEIR PHONES.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.373
- YOU CUT A DEAL FOR THIS?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.275
HE'S PUT A LOT MORE
IN THAT RAG OF HIS.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.777
- THE DEAL IS CONDITIONAL,
MR. GRISCOMB.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.112
DON'T JERK US AROUND.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.181
- RIGHT, OKAY,
SO LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR.

18:01.214 --> 18:06.219
THE FEDS DO NOT HEAR
WHAT COMES NEXT.

18:07.887 --> 18:12.392
- I JACKED INTO A FEW OTHER
PHONES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.594
YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH THE ROM BARO?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.196
- KEEP TALKING.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.131
- THIS WOMAN--
OLDER--

18:18.165 --> 18:20.367
SHE LEFT THE ROM BARO
A VOICE MAIL,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.334
BEGGING FOR HIS HELP.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.570
SHE SAYS, "PEOPLE THINK
OUR SON TOOK NICO."

18:23.603 --> 18:24.604
- WHAT'S THEIR NAME?

18:24.637 --> 18:25.705
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE ONE.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.440
- DID SHE MENTION
HER SON'S NAME.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.243
- JUST MARC.
AND SHE WAS SPOOKED.

18:30.277 --> 18:34.214
LIKE THE VILLAGERS WERE
GONNA GET THE PITCHFORKS.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.448
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT'S NOT NICO?

18:35.482 --> 18:36.549
- SO SORRY.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.650
IT WASN'T HIM.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.253
SOMEBODY HACKED
INTO HIS VOICE MAIL.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.053
- WHY?

18:41.087 --> 18:42.622
WHO WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.157
- WE'RE DEALING
WITH THAT NOW.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.360
- WE DO HAVE A NAME--
MARC.

18:47.394 --> 18:53.366
AND DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

18:53.400 --> 18:55.568
- MRS. RAJIC.
IS YOUR SON, MARC, HOME?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.870
- HE DOESN'T LIVE
HERE ANYMORE.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.539
- WHERE IS HE?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.408
- YOU TELL ME.

19:01.441 --> 19:05.212
GO AWAY.
I'M WATCHING MY SHOWS.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.684
- BACK TO THE ROM BARO?

19:11.718 --> 19:13.286
- YEAH, AND TELL HIM WHAT?

19:13.320 --> 19:16.189
THAT A REPORTER HACKED
HIS VOICE MAIL?

19:16.223 --> 19:17.924
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.526
DO YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.761
- YEAH, DOWN THE BLOCK.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.763
IS THIS ABOUT
THE MISSING KID?

19:23.796 --> 19:26.266
- DO YOU KNOW THE RAJICS?

19:26.299 --> 19:27.767
- THEY KEEP
TO THEMSELVES.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.936
- THEY?
SHE DOESN'T LIVE ALONE?

19:29.969 --> 19:31.604
- SHE HAS A SON.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.440
UNFORTUNATE.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.942
KID'S BRAIN STOPPED GROWING
BEFORE HIS BODY DID.

19:35.975 --> 19:39.212
MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS
ARE SCARED OF HIM.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.448
SHE KEEPS HIM LOCKED
IN THE BASEMENT.

19:41.481 --> 19:45.418
- UM...
WE HEARD HE MOVED AWAY.

19:45.452 --> 19:49.856
- IF YOU MEAN LAST NIGHT.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.425
I WAS WALKING THE DOG,
AND I SAW HIS MOTHER

19:52.459 --> 19:56.529
AND TWO OTHER GYPS--
ITINERANTS HUSTLE HIM

19:56.563 --> 20:00.767
INTO ONE OF THOSE HANDICAP VANS
FROM NEW JERSEY.

20:04.937 --> 20:05.938
- THEY COME AND THEY GO.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.540
THEY'RE GYPSIES.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.710
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T SET FIRE
TO ANYTHING OR PANHANDLE,

20:10.743 --> 20:11.711
WE LEAVE THEM BE.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.812
[dog barks]

20:12.845 --> 20:14.681
- A GREAT PLACE
TO HIDE SOMEBODY.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.950
- WATCH YOUR BACK.
- YEAH.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.754
[dog growls]

20:21.788 --> 20:25.392
HEY, FOLKS.
HOW WE DOING TONIGHT?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.959
- HEY, FRIENDS.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.695
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MARC RAJIC.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.564
ANYBODY KNOW HIM?

20:35.001 --> 20:36.703
- HEY!

20:40.307 --> 20:41.308
- HEY,
OUT OF THE WAY.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.375
OUT OF THE WAY,
NOW.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.247
ROLLINS?

20:49.949 --> 20:53.953
- DROP IT.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.524
DON'T MAKE ME
SHOOT YOU.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.925
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.061
- DOWN ON THE GROUND,
NOW.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.696
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.532
I GOT THIS. I GOT IT.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.835
- I TURN AROUND,
AND YOU'RE GONE.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.403
HOW ABOUT
A HEADS-UP, HUH?

21:10.437 --> 21:12.972
- HOW ABOUT YOU KEEP UP?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.913
- I DIDN'T HURT NICO.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.349
SO WHY'D YOU RUN?

21:22.382 --> 21:25.051
- MY MOM SAID STAY AWAY
FROM STRANGERS.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.354
- THAT'S...GOOD,
MARC.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.690
YOU LISTENED.
YOU DID AS YOU WERE TOLD.

21:30.723 --> 21:34.961
- MY MOM SAID
NOT TO TALK TO ANYONE.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.829
- WELL, WHY DO YOU
THINK SHE SAID THAT?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.532
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.
SHE'D BE MAD.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.500
- WELL...

21:40.533 --> 21:45.071
[clears throat]
WE DON'T WANT HER TO BE MAD.

21:45.104 --> 21:48.708
- NICO'S MOM IS PROBABLY
PRETTY UPSET RIGHT NOW, TOO.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.344
SO IF YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS,
TELL US SO WE CAN FIND HIM.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.614
- AND THAT WAY,
NOBODY HAS TO BE MAD ANYMORE.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.719
- I SAW NICO.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.788
- THAT'S GOOD, MARC.

22:01.821 --> 22:02.855
WHEN?

22:02.889 --> 22:04.591
- MONDAY.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.125
- OKAY, GREAT.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.761
AND DID YOU MEET HIM
AFTER SCHOOL?

22:08.795 --> 22:11.898
- NO, I DON'T GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT MY MOM.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.701
- SO...DID HE COME OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE?

22:14.734 --> 22:18.438
- MY MOM SAYS
I CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE OVER.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.439
BUT...

22:19.472 --> 22:22.108
- HEY, HEY, HEY, EASY.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.577
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET IN ANY TROUBLE.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.547
JUST TELL US
WHO YOU HAD OVER.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.148
- I CAN'T TELL YOU.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.451
I DID A BAD THING.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.720
[knocking on door]

22:33.753 --> 22:37.023
- MARC,
YOU STOP TALKING NOW.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.691
- OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST
DONE HERE.

22:38.725 --> 22:39.892
- YOU KEEP
ASKING QUESTIONS,

22:39.926 --> 22:42.028
AFTER HIS ATTORNEY ARRIVES,
I'LL GET IT ALL THROWN OUT.

22:42.061 --> 22:42.929
YOU'RE DONE, NOW.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.398
- DETECTIVE,
YOU REMEMBER THE ROM BARO.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.800
HE IS ALSO
MR. RAJIC'S LAWYER.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.970
- WONDERFUL.

22:51.003 --> 22:54.541
- MARC RAJIC HAS THE MENTAL
CAPACITY OF A CHILD.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.808
HE MAY NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND--

22:55.842 --> 22:57.109
- HE UNDERSTANDS PLENTY.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.945
HE KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.947
- THAT WILL BE DECIDED
BY A JUDGE

23:00.980 --> 23:03.783
AT A CAPACITY HEARING,
BUT IT WON'T GET THAT FAR.

23:03.816 --> 23:07.854
DO YOU HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE
TO HOLD HIM?

23:07.887 --> 23:12.859
WELL, THEN I'LL BE TAKING MARC
HOME TO HIS MOTHER.

23:12.892 --> 23:13.893
PSST.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.438
- WE LIKE RAJIC FOR THIS?

23:25.472 --> 23:27.106
- THEY HID HIM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.075
HE RAN
WHEN WE CAME FOR HIM.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.044
HE'S GUILTY
ABOUT SOMETHING.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.714
WE JUST--
WE NEED TO SEARCH THE HOUSE.

23:34.747 --> 23:35.815
- HER MOTHER WON'T LET US IN.

23:35.848 --> 23:36.883
WE'LL NEED A WARRANT.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.017
- HIS TRIBE IS CIRCLING.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.086
IF THIS GUY IS
WHAT HE THINK HE IS,

23:40.119 --> 23:42.522
NICO ISN'T THE ONLY KID
HE EYEBALLED.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.389
- HMM.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.125
- ONE OF HIS NEIGHBORS--
NOT ROMANI--

23:46.158 --> 23:48.661
SAID HIS DAUGHTER
AND HER FRIENDS WERE SPOOKED.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.963
- WELL, SEE IF THEY
CAN GET US TO A WARRANT.

23:50.997 --> 23:54.934
- EXCUSE ME.

23:54.967 --> 23:58.037
- MARC'S KIND OF CREEPY,

23:58.070 --> 24:00.873
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'D HURT ANYONE.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.042
- SO WHY DID YOU TELL YOUR DAD
YOU WERE SCARED OF HIM?

24:03.075 --> 24:05.712
- WELL, HE STARES
AT THE KIDS ON THE BLOCK.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.780
- I KIND OF WORRY
ABOUT MARC.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.817
- YEAH?
WHY IS THAT?

24:10.850 --> 24:13.219
- I MEAN, WHAT'S HE GOING
TO DO WHEN HIS MOTHER DIES?

24:13.252 --> 24:15.054
- HMM.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.123
WHAT ABOUT NICO
AND MARC?

24:17.156 --> 24:20.259
YOU EVER SEE THEM
TOGETHER OR?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.729
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.163
MARC--HE'S...

24:24.196 --> 24:25.865
CREEPY.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.034
- YOU EVER SEEN
MARC WITH NICO?

24:28.067 --> 24:31.538
- I SHOULD HAVE SAID
SOMETHING EARLIER.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.572
- WHAT?

24:32.605 --> 24:34.641
- BUT HE SCARED ME.

24:34.674 --> 24:39.078
I WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT
COME AFTER ME NEXT.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.614
- GO AHEAD AND TELL ME,
SWEETHEART.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.884
- THE NIGHT NICO
DIDN'T COME HOME...

24:44.917 --> 24:46.986
I SAW MARC...

24:47.019 --> 24:48.821
SITTING ON HIS FRONT PORCH.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.057
HE WAS HOLDING
THIS RABBIT'S FOOT.

24:51.090 --> 24:57.096
I'M NOT SURE,
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE NICO'S.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.100
- I DON'T WANT THEM
IN HERE.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.002
WE GOT A WARRANT,
MRS. RAJIC.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.303
- MY MARC
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.304
I KEEP HIM
LOCKED IN THE--

25:05.337 --> 25:06.305
- SHH. ANA.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.974
LET THE POLICE
DO WHAT THEY DO.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.609
WE'VE BEEN HARASSED BEFORE.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.579
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.785
- HE ALWAYS LOCKED IN?

25:18.818 --> 25:23.823
- DON'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.824
- THIS IS MY ROOM!

25:24.857 --> 25:25.992
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MARC.

25:26.025 --> 25:31.197
COME AND WAIT WITH ME WHILE
THE POLICE DO THEIR WORK.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.201
- HMM.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.136
TWO BRIDGES DONUTS.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.304
IT'S OVER BY EAST BROADWAY.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.039
- IS THAT NEAR
NICO'S SCHOOL?

25:40.072 --> 25:41.307
- IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.909
- SHH.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.814
- LOOKY HERE,
METRO CARD.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.081
- THAT'S NOT HIS.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.150
MY BOY DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO TAKE THE SUBWAY.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.685
- OH, WE FOUND HIM
IN THE BACKWOODS OF JERSEY,

25:52.719 --> 25:53.853
HIDING IN A PACK OF GOATS.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.923
YOUR SON GETS AROUND MORE
THAN YOU THINK, MRS. RAJIC.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.745
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOY'S LUCK
JUST CHANGED.

26:25.752 --> 26:29.221
[camera shutters click]

26:29.255 --> 26:31.090
CALLED A GUY AT TWO BRIDGES,

26:31.123 --> 26:33.893
THINKS MARC LOOKS FAMILIAR,
BUT HE'S NOT POSITIVE.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.863
- OKAY, MTA SAYS THAT MARC'S
METRO CARD WAS LAST SWIPED

26:36.896 --> 26:39.632
MONDAY NIGHT, 8:00 P.M.,
EAST BROADWAY STATION.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.067
- SO WE'RE LOOKING
AT EAST BROADWAY,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.302
THAT'S FIVE BLOCKS SOUTH
OF WHERE WE'VE BEEN SEARCHING.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.904
- THAT'S BY
THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.272
THAT'S NO-MAN'S-LAND.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.240
TONS OF CONSTRUCTION
SITES THERE.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.777
HALF OF THEM ABANDONED
SINCE THE MARKET TANKED.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.712
- ALL RIGHT, FIN,
RELOCATE THE GRID SEARCH.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.747
AMARO, ROLLINS,
HEAD DOWNTOWN.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.922
- I THINK WE'RE LOOKING
AT A RECOVERY.

27:02.955 --> 27:03.990
[elevator dings]

27:04.023 --> 27:06.025
THE STATS
DON'T LOOK GOOD FOR HIM.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.431
- WELL, KIDS ARE TOUGH.

27:12.464 --> 27:15.301
YOU NEVER KNOW.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.904
- LIVIDITY IS FIXED
AND APPROPRIATE

27:17.937 --> 27:19.138
FOR HIS POSITION AS FOUND,

27:19.171 --> 27:21.207
THE CONSTRUCTION SITE
WHERE HE WAS RECOVERED

27:21.240 --> 27:22.775
IS WHERE HE WAS KILLED.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.777
- [sighs]
WE GOT A TIME OF DEATH?

27:24.811 --> 27:27.413
- IT'S BEEN PRETTY CHILLY,
BUT RIGOR'S PASSED THROUGH.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.348
SIGNS OF EARLY DECOMP--

27:29.381 --> 27:31.884
HE WAS UNDER THAT TARP
AT LEAST 72 HOURS.

27:31.918 --> 27:34.120
- SO HE WAS KILLED
THE NIGHT HE WENT MISSING.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.421
- MM-HMM.
- CIGARETTE BURNS?

27:35.454 --> 27:36.756
- DOZENS.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.758
ON THE BACK OF HIS HANDS,
HIS THIGHS,

27:38.791 --> 27:40.793
AND HIS SCROTUM.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.695
- HE WAS TORTURED.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.831
RITUALISTIC, MAYBE?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.265
- I DON'T THINK SO.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.768
SEE THE HALF-MOON PATTERN
ON THE BURNS?

27:48.801 --> 27:51.437
WHOEVER DID THIS
NEVER LET THE LIT END

27:51.470 --> 27:52.905
MAINTAIN FULL CONTACT.

27:52.939 --> 27:58.044
- IT'S LIKE
THEY'D NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.479
NOW HOW MUCH OF IT
DID HE HAVE TO TAKE?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.348
- ALL OF IT.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.151
WOUNDS SHOW VITAL REACTION,

28:05.184 --> 28:06.786
HIS CLOTHES
WERE SOAKED IN URINE,

28:06.819 --> 28:07.920
HE WAS TERRIFIED.

28:07.954 --> 28:11.090
- THIS, ON HIS NECK,
IS THAT CAUSE?

28:11.123 --> 28:15.061
- LIGATURE STRANGULATION
WITH HIS OWN SCARF.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.329
- ANY BIOLOGICALS OR DNA
ON THE BODY?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.498
- NO, BUT WE MAY GET A HIT OFF
THE CIGARETTE BUTTS

28:19.531 --> 28:20.767
YOU RECOVERED AT THE SCENE.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.035
- HOLD OFF ON THAT, MELINDA.

28:23.069 --> 28:26.739
THE PARENTS ARE HERE
TO MAKE THE I.D.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.274
COVER HIM UP.

28:34.781 --> 28:38.450
- JUST TELL US
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

28:44.123 --> 28:48.094
- [softly laughs]
IT'S NOT HIM.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.529
IT'S NOT MY BOY.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.432
DO YOU SEE?
DO YOU SEE?

28:53.465 --> 28:54.433
IT'S NOT NICO.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.136
- BABY, BABY, PLEASE.

28:57.169 --> 29:00.106
- HE'S NOT MY BOY.

29:00.139 --> 29:03.943
THIS IS NOT HIS FACE.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.478
HIS EYES--

29:06.512 --> 29:11.918
- NICO'S GONE, NADIA.

29:11.951 --> 29:18.357
THIS--THIS ISN'T HOW
YOU'RE GOING TO REMEMBER HIM...

29:18.390 --> 29:20.292
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.336
- [sniffling]

29:30.369 --> 29:31.370
[softly sobbing]

29:31.403 --> 29:34.006
- IT'S HIM.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.208
IT'S OUR SON.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.811
- [sobbing]

29:48.087 --> 29:49.055
- IT'S HER FAULT.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.356
YOU SHOULD ARREST HER, TOO.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.424
SHE KEPT HIM
LOCKED UP THERE IN A CAGE!

29:52.458 --> 29:53.392
- NADIA, THAT'S ENOUGH.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.095
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT MARC KILLED OUR CHILD.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.329
WHY HAVEN'T
YOU CHARGED HIM YET?

29:57.363 --> 29:58.364
- WE'RE BUILDING OUR CASE.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.432
MR. GREY, WE NEED TO GO BACK
OVER EVERY PIECE--

30:00.466 --> 30:02.468
- ROM BARO--
EVEN THE NYPD IS AFRAID.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.904
ONLY MY HUSBAND
IS FOOL ENOUGH TO DEFY THEM.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.039
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT HIM,

30:07.073 --> 30:08.841
BUT WE DO
NEED YOUR HELP NOW.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.876
- [scoffs]

30:09.909 --> 30:12.311
- IF THERE IS ANY DETAIL
THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER

30:12.344 --> 30:13.412
ABOUT NICO'S RELATIONSHIP--

30:13.445 --> 30:14.446
- [hisses]

30:17.116 --> 30:19.218
- WH-WH-WHAT--WHAT?

30:19.251 --> 30:22.088
WHAT IS IT?

30:22.121 --> 30:25.124
- WE DON'T SAY HIS NAME
OUT LOUD.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.625
HE'S--

30:26.658 --> 30:30.029
HE'S DEAD.

30:30.062 --> 30:35.534
HIS SPIRIT WON'T REST.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.436
- I'M--I'M SORRY.

30:37.469 --> 30:41.607
I'M--I'M VERY,
VERY SORRY.

30:41.640 --> 30:45.544
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.446
- OUT.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.149
GET OUT.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.483
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

30:51.517 --> 30:53.385
GET OUT, GET OUT!
- NADIA!

30:53.419 --> 30:58.925
- [screaming]
MY SON!

30:58.958 --> 31:02.028
[sobbing]
MY SON...

31:10.002 --> 31:14.340
- AH, THOSE ARE VERY SWEET,
GUYS, BUT NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.043
- THE KIDS AT SCHOOL
ARE TAKING UP A COLLECTION.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.146
WE'RE GOING
TO PLANT A TREE FOR NICO.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.313
OR SOMETHING.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.449
WE WANT TO TELL THEM.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.483
- ARE THEY OKAY?

31:24.516 --> 31:27.319
- THEY'RE MOURNING.

31:27.353 --> 31:30.322
- THEY'RE PROBABLY UPSET
YOU DIDN'T ARREST MARC YET.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.958
EVERYONE ELSE IS.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.626
- WELL, WE HEARD
MARC'S KEPT LOCKED IN.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.195
HIS MOTHER
DOESN'T LET HIM OUT.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.297
- HIS MOM DOESN'T KNOW.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.167
HE CAN GET OUT
THROUGH THE BACK.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.002
TELL THEM.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.171
- YEAH, WE'VE SEEN HIM
ON HIS ROOF AT NIGHT,

31:45.204 --> 31:50.242
SMOKING.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.011
- COME ON.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.046
HE HAD--
HE HAD THE RABBIT'S FOOT.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.447
HE HAD THE METRO CARD.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.117
- BUT MARC'S DNA ISN'T
ON THOSE CIGARETTE BUTTS.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.251
ALL RIGHT?

31:59.285 --> 32:00.219
HE DOESN'T
SHOW UP ON ANY VIDEO,

32:00.252 --> 32:02.054
WE HAVE NOTHING
THAT TIES HIM TO THE SCENE.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.090
- WE GOT NOTHING,
BUT...

32:04.123 --> 32:06.125
HE HAS BEEN LOCKED
IN A BASEMENT.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.726
EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THINKS HE'S A FREAK.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.728
- YEAH, OKAY,
SO HE'S TOUCHED,

32:09.761 --> 32:11.197
BUT, LOOK,
I DON'T MAKE HIM FOR THIS.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.331
HE'S A CHILD.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.432
- NO, HE'S A MAN-CHILD.
THAT'S IT.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.700
HE'S A MAN-CHILD.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.202
I MEAN, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUYING

32:16.235 --> 32:17.603
THIS WHOLE, "TELL ME
ABOUT THE RABBIT'S FOOT."

32:17.636 --> 32:18.971
- YEAH, YEAH, ACTUALLY I DO--
- OH, MY--

32:19.005 --> 32:21.740
- THAT IS ENOUGH,
YOU TWO.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.143
WELL, THE 6-5 IN BROOKLYN

32:24.176 --> 32:27.413
WOULD LOVE TO MAKE
NICO'S HOMICIDE A PRO FORMA.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.181
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.716
SO LET'S START FROM JUMP.

32:30.749 --> 32:33.652
JUST GET ME SOMETHING
THAT PUTS MARC OR WHOEVER

32:33.685 --> 32:36.122
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

32:36.155 --> 32:39.391
- YES, SIR.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.094
[cell phone rings]

32:42.128 --> 32:43.129
[keypad tone]

32:43.162 --> 32:47.199
- ROLLINS.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.536
WHAT?

32:50.569 --> 32:51.603
OH, MY GOD.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.105
YEAH, KEEP HER--
KEEP HER THERE.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.707
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

32:55.741 --> 33:00.746
NADIA GREY JUST TRIED
TO SET MARC RAJIC ON FIRE.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.385
- SHE DOUSED HIM WITH GASOLINE
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

33:06.418 --> 33:07.619
TRIED TO SPARK HIM.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.055
- MARC OKAY?

33:09.088 --> 33:11.057
- WELL, GOD LOOKS
AFTER KIDS AND IDIOTS.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.524
LUCKY FOR HIM,
HE'S BOTH, RIGHT?

33:12.558 --> 33:13.792
- WE'LL CHECK ON HIM.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.527
- LOOK, WE'RE GOING
TO NEED TO TALK TO NADIA

33:15.561 --> 33:16.595
BEFORE YOU TAKE HER IN.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.330
- ALL RIGHT, HEY,
DO ME A FAVOR?

33:18.364 --> 33:20.032
NEXT TIME SOMEONE TRIES
TO TELL YOU

33:20.066 --> 33:22.501
HOW THESE PEOPLE ARE,
BELIEVE 'EM.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.672
LET'S GO. COME ON.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.744
- NADIA.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.214
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:35.247 --> 33:38.650
- YOU HAD HIM.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.619
AND YOU LET HIM GO.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.288
- WE WERE WATCHING HIM.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.555
- HE'S AN ANIMAL.

33:43.589 --> 33:46.692
[sobbing]
HE BURNED MY BABY.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.361
AND YOU COULDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO HIM?

33:49.395 --> 33:51.730
THE ROM BARO
WILL MAKE SURE THAT HE--

33:51.763 --> 33:54.800
HE KILLED MY SON!

33:54.833 --> 33:56.602
THIS IS JUSTICE.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.105
- NADIA, JUST NOW,
YOU SAID, "BURNED."

33:59.138 --> 34:01.673
WHY?

34:01.707 --> 34:04.376
- [crying]
WITH CIGARETTES.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.112
HE BURNED HIM.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.380
- NADIA,
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

34:08.414 --> 34:11.183
- I DON'T KNOW!

34:11.217 --> 34:13.585
YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW?

34:13.619 --> 34:18.090
THAT MY SON IS DEAD.

34:18.124 --> 34:21.327
THIS IS WHAT I KNOW.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.703
- IT WASN'T RELEASED
TO THE PRESS.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.772
THERE'S NO WAY
NADIA COULD HAVE KNOWN.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.241
- UNLESS THE PARENTS DID IT.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.542
- THE DAD WAS AT WORK.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.578
- MOM CALLED THE SCHOOL
20 TIMES FROM A LANDLINE.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.313
- ALL RIGHT, THEN
WHO TIPPED HER OFF?

34:41.347 --> 34:42.614
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE MARC.

34:42.648 --> 34:46.652
HE'S BEEN IN THE BOX,
OR LOCKED IN HIS BASEMENT.

34:50.389 --> 34:55.427
- THE GIRLS.

34:55.461 --> 34:57.496
THE GIRLS.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.565
AND THEY'VE BEEN
TIPPING US OFF ALL ALONG.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.600
- COURTNEY AND EMMA
ARE 14 YEARS OLD.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.601
- NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.769
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

35:03.802 --> 35:06.238
- TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
NICO'S SCHOOLMATES.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.407
- THEY'RE ALWAYS AROUND,
BRINGING FLOWERS,

35:08.440 --> 35:10.276
ASKING QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE GREYS.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.677
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I KNOW WE'RE ALL TIRED,

35:11.710 --> 35:13.912
BUT SLEEP
IS FOR CLOSED CASES.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.481
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.750
- THERE'S NOTHING IN JUVIE,
NO DISCIPLINE FLAGS

35:18.784 --> 35:20.452
AT CASWELL ACADEMY.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.888
- THEY WERE AT THE SCHOOL
LAST NIGHT PASSING OUT FLIERS.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.423
- SO WERE
A LOT OF OTHER KIDS.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.758
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
THE ONLY ONES THAT LIED TO US.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.227
REMEMBER,
THE GIRLS TOLD US

35:28.260 --> 35:29.928
THAT THE LAST TIME
THEY SAW NICO,

35:29.961 --> 35:31.163
IT WAS THAT MORNING,

35:31.197 --> 35:34.366
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.635
SO THIS IS
THE LAST IMAGE OF NICO,

35:36.668 --> 35:39.171
TIME STAMP, 3:37.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.172
- NO MARC RAJIC.

35:40.206 --> 35:42.641
- NO, BUT...

35:42.674 --> 35:44.910
THERE COME OUR TWO GIRLS,

35:44.943 --> 35:46.712
AND IT'S JUST
A FEW SECONDS LATER.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.347
- IT IS THE ROUTE
TO THEIR SUBWAY.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.481
- OR THEY DID IT.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.383
AND THEY STASHED
THE RABBIT'S FOOT

35:51.417 --> 35:53.219
AND THE METRO CARD
IN MARC'S ROOM.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.520
- WHY DIDN'T
HE JUST TELL US?

35:54.553 --> 35:55.554
- WELL, HIS WHOLE LIFE,

35:55.587 --> 35:56.955
HIS MOTHER TOLD HIM
TO STAY AWAY FROM PEOPLE,

35:56.988 --> 35:58.490
NOT LET ANYONE IN HIS ROOM.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.625
HE WON'T TALK.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.759
- BUT THERE IS SOMEONE

36:00.792 --> 36:03.895
WHO COULD GET HIM
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.532
- THE POLICE
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROMANI?

36:06.565 --> 36:09.235
FORGIVE ME
IF I'M SKEPTICAL.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.236
- THIS ISN'T A CON.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.637
WE DON'T THINK
MARC HURT NICO.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.472
- BUT WE THINK
HE KNOWS WHO DID.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.207
- AND IF THIS IS
ALL A TRICK,

36:15.241 --> 36:16.708
YOU'VE ALREADY
DEMONIZED HIM.

36:16.742 --> 36:20.446
HIS OWN PEOPLE
WANT TO KILL HIM.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.314
- YOU'VE GOT TWO VICTIMS
RIGHT NOW.

36:22.348 --> 36:26.452
- NICO GREY AND MARC.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.821
JUST TELL MARC THAT
HE CAN TRUST US.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.857
HELP US GET JUSTICE
FOR BOTH OF THEM.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.765
- THE ROM BARO TOLD US
SOMEONE VISITED YOUR ROOM.

36:39.798 --> 36:43.369
WHO WAS IT?

36:43.402 --> 36:45.937
- THEY SNUCK IN THE WINDOW.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.540
AND I--I TOLD THEM
MOM DON'T LIKE IT

36:48.574 --> 36:50.642
WHEN STRANGERS
ARE IN THE HOUSE.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.478
- WHO, MARC?

36:52.511 --> 36:55.647
- THE PRETTY GIRL,
COURTNEY.

36:55.681 --> 37:00.018
SHE HAS A NICE DOG.
AND EMMA.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.687
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.655
- ON MONDAY NIGHT.

37:03.689 --> 37:07.659
THEY MADE ME
STOP WATCHING FOOTBALL.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.528
- IS THAT WHAT MARC DID?

37:09.561 --> 37:11.530
BURN NICO?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.899
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.634
- AND YOU'RE SURE
THAT YOU DIDN'T TELL

37:15.667 --> 37:17.269
MRS. GREY ABOUT THAT?

37:17.303 --> 37:18.970
- NO.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.808
SHE SAID I DID?

37:22.841 --> 37:26.312
SHE'S GONE A LITTLE...

37:26.345 --> 37:28.414
YOU KNOW.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.015
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.383
- OKAY.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.420
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL,
COURTNEY.

37:40.426 --> 37:43.695
- OH, WHY ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING TO EMMA?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.668
- RIGHT IN HERE.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.303
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.572
- PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.842
- MY DAUGHTER
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.983
- SHE TOLD US ABOUT MARC.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.652
- 'CAUSE HE DID IT.
HE'S THE ONE.

38:06.685 --> 38:10.522
- YEAH.
HOW ARE YOU SO SURE?

38:10.556 --> 38:12.057
- 'CAUSE COURTNEY SAID...

38:12.090 --> 38:15.594
- IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOU SAW MARC

38:15.627 --> 38:16.662
FOLLOWING NICO
AFTER SCHOOL?

38:16.695 --> 38:19.798
- NO, WE DIDN'T
SEE NICO AFTER SCHOOL.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.734
- YOU SURE?

38:22.768 --> 38:27.573
- WHAT DID COURTNEY SAY?

38:27.606 --> 38:31.810
- WE KNOW
YOU'RE LYING, EMMA.

38:31.843 --> 38:36.548
WE HAVE YOU ON VIDEO
FOLLOWING NICO.

38:36.582 --> 38:37.949
- EMMA...

38:37.983 --> 38:43.655
- YOU REMEMBER THAT?

38:43.689 --> 38:48.827
- WHAT ELSE DID THEY DO?

38:48.860 --> 38:50.796
- I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO SAY.

38:50.829 --> 38:56.101
- IT'S OKAY, MARC.
YOUR MOM WON'T KNOW.

38:58.103 --> 39:02.408
- COURTNEY TOUCHED ME
DOWN THERE.

39:02.441 --> 39:06.111
AND I--I--I--
I TOLD HER IT WAS WRONG.

39:06.144 --> 39:09.415
AND...

39:09.448 --> 39:12.884
- GO AHEAD.

39:12.918 --> 39:17.389
- STUFF CAME OUT,
AND IT FELT FUNNY,

39:17.423 --> 39:19.891
BUT NICE.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.828
THEN THEY GAVE ME
A RABBIT'S FOOT.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.532
AND THEY TOLD ME
IF I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE,

39:26.565 --> 39:29.768
THEY'D COME BACK
AND DO IT AGAIN.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.804
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE ASKING ME.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.073
MARC DID IT,
DIDN'T HE?

39:35.106 --> 39:41.012
- HE JUST TOLD MY PARTNER
YOU TWO WERE IN HIS ROOM.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.414
NOW DO YOU WANT ME
TO TELL YOUR MOTHER

39:42.448 --> 39:44.550
WHAT HE SAYS
YOU DID TO HIM?

39:44.583 --> 39:47.185
- NO.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.154
- DETECTIVE,
YOU'RE FRIGHTENING MY DAUGHTER.

39:49.187 --> 39:49.988
- AM I?

39:50.021 --> 39:52.958
ARE YOU A LITTLE
SCARED NOW, EMMA?

39:52.991 --> 39:54.493
BEING HERE?

39:54.526 --> 39:57.563
HOW DO YOU THINK
NICO FELT?

39:57.596 --> 40:01.700
YOU THINK
HE WAS SCARED?

40:01.733 --> 40:07.138
WAS HE SCARED WHEN YOU
PUT OUT LIT CIGARETTES ON HIM?

40:07.172 --> 40:10.075
- EMMA,
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

40:10.108 --> 40:11.443
- OPEN YOUR EYES, EMMA!

40:11.477 --> 40:13.144
LOOK AT HIM.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.646
[sobbing]

40:14.680 --> 40:17.215
HE WAS SO SCARED,
HE WET HIS PANTS.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.717
AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

40:18.750 --> 40:19.718
DID YOU LAUGH AT HIM?

40:19.751 --> 40:21.119
OR DID YOU BURN HIM AGAIN?

40:21.152 --> 40:24.490
- NO, IT WAS COURTNEY.

40:24.523 --> 40:27.959
WE WERE
JUST PLAYING AROUND.

40:27.993 --> 40:31.096
WE PANTSED HIM,
BUT--

40:31.129 --> 40:34.099
COURTNEY--
SHE WOULDN'T STOP.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.703
SHE LIT A CIGARETTE,
AND...

40:37.736 --> 40:39.170
- AND YOU DIDN'T SAY, "NO."

40:39.204 --> 40:43.475
- [crying]
I TRIED TO.

40:43.509 --> 40:44.676
[sniffles]

40:44.710 --> 40:48.246
I TOLD HER TO QUIT IT,
THAT WE SHOULD JUST GO.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.181
BUT HE WAS CRYING,

40:50.215 --> 40:53.619
AND HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO CALL HIS MOM.

40:56.254 --> 41:01.860
SO COURTNEY GRABBED
HIS SCARF...

41:01.893 --> 41:02.661
[sobbing]

41:02.694 --> 41:07.232
AND I WAS YELLING,
"STOP, STOP."

41:07.265 --> 41:10.836
AND SHE SAID,
"HE'S JUST A DUMB GYPSY.

41:10.869 --> 41:14.740
WHO'S GOING TO MISS HIM?"

41:26.151 --> 41:28.687
- THE STUPID LITTLE BITCH.

41:28.720 --> 41:29.888
- COURTNEY.

41:33.158 --> 41:36.562
- IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

41:36.595 --> 41:39.064
WE WERE JUST FOOLING
AROUND WITH HIM.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.832
AND HE STARTED CRYING,

41:40.866 --> 41:43.835
AND MAKING LIKE
HE WAS GOING TO TELL.

41:43.869 --> 41:48.707
- SO, YOU MADE SURE
HE WOULDN'T.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.743
- I SHUT HIM UP.

41:51.777 --> 41:54.880
- AND THEN
YOU WENT TO MARC'S.

41:54.913 --> 41:58.950
- HE SNITCHED?

41:58.984 --> 42:01.820
I GAVE HIM THE ONLY FUN
HE'S EVER HAD.

42:01.853 --> 42:05.023
- OKAY, MY DAUGHTER HAS
A PERVERSE SENSE OF HUMOR,

42:05.056 --> 42:07.158
BUT I THINK
IT'S TIME TO STOP.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.894
NOW I'M CALLING MY LAWYER.

42:08.927 --> 42:12.263
- IT'S A LITTLE LATE, DAD.

42:12.297 --> 42:14.633
- SHE'S RIGHT.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.239
- ANYTHING ELSE?

42:21.272 --> 42:23.008
- YEAH.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.613
WHY?

42:32.618 --> 42:35.086
- WHY NOT?
