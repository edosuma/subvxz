WEBVTT

00:01.876 --> 00:03.837
Oh, hey.
Look, I can't tell you

00:03.878 --> 00:05.422
what happened last week
on  Shameless.

00:05.463 --> 00:06.840
I'm dealing with a bit
of a plumbing issue.

00:06.881 --> 00:09.509
-[liquid bubbling]
- Fuck!

00:09.551 --> 00:12.262
Debbie!
Hey, get up here, all right?

00:12.303 --> 00:13.888
Franny tried to flush
a Care Bear

00:13.930 --> 00:15.765
down the toilet again.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.393
Dementia?

00:18.435 --> 00:21.187
Motherfucker!

00:21.229 --> 00:25.150
How did I get here?
Fiona? Lip?

00:25.191 --> 00:26.526
[Mickey]
Terry's coming home today.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.028
[Ian]  They sending him home
with a nurse

00:28.069 --> 00:29.362
-or something at least?
-I don't think so.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.406
Can I help?

00:31.448 --> 00:32.866
My mom's moving to Louisville.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.368
She says there's no community
here for her anymore.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.371
I just wanna crawl into bed
and cry myself to sleep.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.040
[Lip]  Look, we sell
the stuff from Born Free,

00:40.081 --> 00:42.000
-that'll carry us for a while.
-Can't use my garage.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.418
Yeah, we couldn't
use that anyway.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.919
You know, it's the first place
cops would look.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.254
-The cops?
-Yeah, they might come

00:46.296 --> 00:47.714
pokin' around.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.132
[Tami] Hey, did you hear
Born Free

00:49.174 --> 00:51.634
-got broken into last--
-[Lip]  Brad and I broke in.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.094
I just--I needed to do
something.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.637
And if you get caught
and go to jail,

00:54.679 --> 00:56.639
what is that gonna fix?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.725
[Debbie]  So why didn't you
tell me you abandoned a kid?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.310
You ran out on people
who needed you

01:00.351 --> 01:02.228
because you wanted to
go do your own shit.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.398
You are piling all your
abandonment issues on me.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.900
Monica ran out on you,

01:06.941 --> 01:09.194
and now the rest of them
wanna run out on you too.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.403
Fuck!

01:10.445 --> 01:11.571
[Debbie] What the fuck
are you doing?

01:11.613 --> 01:13.073
-We're selling!
-No!

01:13.114 --> 01:14.699
-[Lip] Hey--
-[overlapping yelling]

01:14.741 --> 01:15.992
[detective] Does
Philip Gallagher live here?

01:16.034 --> 01:17.243
He's inside.
Just be careful.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.746
He's got a sledgehammer.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.881
rock music

01:34.803 --> 01:38.098
Think of all
the luck you got

01:38.139 --> 01:41.142
Know that
it's not for naught

01:41.184 --> 01:44.604
You were beaming
once before

01:44.646 --> 01:48.942
But it's not like that
anymore

01:48.983 --> 01:52.112
What is this downside

01:52.153 --> 01:55.782
That you speak of?

01:55.824 --> 01:57.742
What is this feeling

01:57.784 --> 02:00.537
You're so sure of?

02:09.003 --> 02:12.757
Round up
the friends you got

02:12.799 --> 02:15.593
Know that
they're not for naught

02:15.635 --> 02:19.097
You were willing
once before

02:19.139 --> 02:23.268
But it's not like that
anymore

02:23.309 --> 02:26.437
What is this downside

02:26.479 --> 02:29.983
That you speak of?

02:30.024 --> 02:32.443
What is this feeling

02:32.485 --> 02:35.655
You're so sure of?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.499
[detainee] Psst!

02:46.541 --> 02:48.668
Psst!

02:48.710 --> 02:50.170
[softly] Hey!

02:50.211 --> 02:52.046
Psst! Psst!

02:52.088 --> 02:54.632
[detainee]
You wanna watch me jerk off?

02:54.674 --> 02:56.134
[Lip] Thanks, but fuck no.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.635
-[buzzer]
-[click]

02:58.803 --> 03:00.972
Hey, you got any updates
on what's goin' on?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.640
[cop] When the detectives
are ready for you,

03:02.682 --> 03:04.184
-they'll let ya know.
-All right, could I get

03:04.225 --> 03:05.643
-a sandwich or somethin'?
-Legally don't gotta provide

03:05.685 --> 03:07.187
any food, 'cause legally
you're not under arrest.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.147
All right, so legally,
I can just go.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.274
Sure, but you try to leave,
they probably will arrest you

03:11.316 --> 03:13.818
and bring you right back in.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.862
[Lip exhales]

03:16.404 --> 03:19.574
[detainee] Psst!

03:20.158 --> 03:22.827
-Is Lip okay?
-[Carl] Ah, he'll be all right.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.829
It's not his first time
getting questioned.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.331
He can handle an interrogation.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.374
You can't just use your cop
"get outta jail free" card?

03:28.416 --> 03:29.876
When I get in,
I'm gonna try to

03:29.918 --> 03:31.044
grease the wheels
of justice.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.379
Do we have
any triple-A batteries?

03:33.421 --> 03:35.006
That's a big hole.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.425
Coulda just said
he wanted to renovate.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.052
Your brother's
a fuckin' drama queen, man.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.762
Hey, scarf that shit down.
I wanna go check on Terry.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.764
We have a lotta pick-ups today.
I don't know if we have time.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.350
We would if you stopped yappin'
and started eatin'.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.851
[Liam] You guys remember I have
a thing after school, right?

03:46.893 --> 03:47.852
[Ian] Yeah, of course.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.229
[Carl] Wouldn't miss it, buddy.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.190
What thing?
Don't ya want your dad there,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.400
-cheerin' you on?
-Mm...not really.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.236
Well, what is it, anyway?

03:56.277 --> 03:58.071
A contest to pick a new name
for my school.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.948
The winner
gets a free iPad.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.658
Why does your school
need a new name?

04:01.699 --> 04:04.244
'Cause it's named
after Dennis Hastert.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.120
Fuck is Dennis Hastert?

04:06.162 --> 04:09.332
Former speaker of
the House of Representative.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.376
-Native Chicagoan.
-And a child molester.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.503
He's canceled.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.381
Canceled?
You can't cancel history.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.424
It's already happened.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.760
Political correctness
is gonna kill this country.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.428
He diddled kids.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.222
Uh, beside the point.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.183
We can't be applying
today's sexual standards

04:27.225 --> 04:29.769
to...molesters of yesteryear.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.271
Molesting used to be okay?

04:31.312 --> 04:33.439
[Frank] Dennis Hastert
brought a lotta federal dollars

04:33.481 --> 04:34.941
to Illinois.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.609
I don't think
I can just stand by

04:36.651 --> 04:39.279
while the PC police
erase his legacy.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.073
This is the hill
you wanna die on, Frank?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.158
-Defending a pedo?
-[Frank] Defending tradition,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.619
defending our shared history?
Yeah.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.663
I'll die on this hill.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.165
This is a hill
we all should die on together.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.126
[Mickey] Come on.
Hey, let's go.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.128
I wanna make sure they're
takin' care of fuckin' Terry

04:55.169 --> 04:57.005
over there.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.007
That one has an Uber
coming for him in ten,

04:59.048 --> 05:01.217
and that one isn't my problem.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.177
-[Ian] Where's Debbie?
-Since when am I in charge

05:03.219 --> 05:04.971
of keeping track of Debbie?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.222
Aren't you in, like,
a committed

05:06.264 --> 05:07.557
lesbian scissoring thing?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.267
You mean a relationship?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.561
I don't know.
We never defined it.

05:11.602 --> 05:14.147
But, uh, since she didn't come
home last night, I guess not.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.149
What are supposed to do
with Franny?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.276
-We gotta get to work.
-She's not my fucking problem.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.404
None of this shit is,
your sister included.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.573
-[door slams]
-[Carl] Okay, come on, Franny.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.825
I will drop you off at school
on my way to work.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.910
Okay, hey, uh, let me know

05:27.952 --> 05:29.620
when you find out about Lip,
all right?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.331
Yeah.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.833
Uh, what's that guy doing?

05:33.875 --> 05:37.420
upbeat music

05:37.462 --> 05:40.131
This goddamn thing
doesn't work!

05:42.717 --> 05:44.385
-Shit!
-[remote clatters]

05:46.304 --> 05:48.806
-[moans] Mm--
-[Kev] All right, my love,

05:48.848 --> 05:50.641
I let ya sleep in.
I even turned a blind eye

05:50.683 --> 05:52.310
when you moved from the bed
to the couch

05:52.352 --> 05:53.811
and slept some more.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.897
But now it's time
to carpet denim.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.316
-[Veronica] What?
-Carpet denim.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.525
It's Latin for wake up!

05:59.567 --> 06:02.528
Oh, I just wanna sleep.
Please.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.531
You wanna talk about it?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.909
My mama's moving.
She's abandoning us.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.495
-What's there to talk about?
-Oh, we can go visit

06:10.536 --> 06:12.038
for holidays and stuff.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.207
Who doesn't wanna spend
Christmas in Kentucky?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.418
V, if you don't get up,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.212
we're gonna be late
opening the Alibi.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.005
-Who cares?
-What about the girls?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.548
We gotta get them ready--
you don't want me

06:22.590 --> 06:24.634
-doing their hair, do you?
-Who cares?

06:24.675 --> 06:26.636
V, you're the one
who always says

06:26.677 --> 06:28.513
that a white woman
can take her daughter to school

06:28.554 --> 06:30.807
lookin' any old way,
but if a Black woman does it,

06:30.848 --> 06:32.558
people start to question
whether she's a fit mother--

06:32.600 --> 06:33.810
Go away!

06:33.851 --> 06:36.145
Is there anything I can do
to get you up?

06:36.187 --> 06:37.897
-Okay, fine.
-Oh.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.899
-[small laugh] I'm up.
-Okay, great!

06:39.941 --> 06:42.151
[Veronica] I'm goin' back
upstairs and gettin' into bed.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.320
You keep botherin' me,
I'ma stab your ass.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.988
Watch.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.990
[muffled toilet flushing]

06:48.032 --> 06:49.909
[sighs]

06:49.951 --> 06:51.327
[Calista] How'd you sleep?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.496
[Debbie] Not great.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.040
Seriously, who the fuck
do they think they are?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.875
I'm sorry, I don't know
who we're talking about.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.420
My family.
Sandy, her...

07:00.461 --> 07:02.880
fucking husband,
and her secret child.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.800
Thanks for letting me crash,
by the way.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.802
Feel bad
I put you outta your bed.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.389
-Couch is pretty comfortable.
-I mean, we could have shared.

07:12.056 --> 07:14.392
Under normal circumstances,
I would have loved that.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.185
But I can tell
you're pretty emotional,

07:16.227 --> 07:18.729
and I didn't wanna
take advantage.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.065
[phone chimes]

07:28.990 --> 07:30.575
You got plans today?

07:30.616 --> 07:31.868
[Calista]  Work.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.287
-Too bad.
-[beads clatter] But...

07:34.328 --> 07:36.789
I'm the boss.
You wanna come?

07:38.749 --> 07:40.376
[sighs]

07:40.418 --> 07:43.129
See, I was at home
with my lady and my kid.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.131
All right?
She'll vouch for me.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.799
The kid, he can't talk yet,
but if he could,

07:46.841 --> 07:48.968
he'd say Daddy was home
all night.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.761
[Jones] We have
your juvenile arrest records,

07:50.803 --> 07:52.472
okay?

07:52.513 --> 07:54.807
So you can drop
the choir boy act.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.851
No, you see, tha-that's
the old me, all right?

07:56.893 --> 07:59.812
I'm reformed now.
I'm sober, even.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.064
You know, I'm not sayin'
I'm a saint but, uh,

08:02.106 --> 08:03.900
I'm a family man,
makin' an honest living.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.318
Okay, asshole,

08:05.359 --> 08:07.236
we know that you were involved
with the robbery,

08:07.278 --> 08:09.614
so you can either cooperate,
or we can make you cooperate.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.532
All right, first of all,
if you knew I was involved

08:11.574 --> 08:13.159
in the robbery,
I'd be in cuffs right now,

08:13.201 --> 08:15.036
and second of all,
I am cooperating.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.288
What am I doing
if I'm not cooperating?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.665
Look, make it easy on yourself.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.251
Tell us where the bikes are,
who helped you,

08:22.293 --> 08:26.088
and maybe we can recommend
you avoid doin' real time.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.883
punchy music

08:32.678 --> 08:34.722
Hey, can I go?
[sniffs]

08:46.234 --> 08:48.027
[Lip clears his throat]

08:52.490 --> 08:55.618
Oh, motherfucker, when's the
last time that got changed?

08:55.660 --> 08:57.119
Fuck do I know?
I can't see it.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.038
-You can smell it, though.
-We don't have time for this.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.665
We're behind schedule,
and we have to wrap up early

09:00.706 --> 09:02.959
for Liam's thing.
Mickey--

09:04.043 --> 09:06.587
What the fuck are you--
Hey, get--

09:06.629 --> 09:08.005
[door slams]

09:08.047 --> 09:10.299
[Ian] Come on, man.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.051
Aah.
What the hell, Mick?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.262
Terry duty, asshole.
Get up!

09:14.303 --> 09:16.764
Naw, no way, man.
I took care of him on Tuesday.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.558
-It's not my turn--
-Empty his shit bag,

09:18.599 --> 09:21.519
or I empty your skull--
your choice.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.983
Uh, hey, could you
look up something

09:27.024 --> 09:28.693
related to a recent arrest
for me?

09:28.734 --> 09:30.278
Sure.
What's the name of the perp?

09:30.319 --> 09:32.238
Um...Philip Gallagher.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.992
Rookie,
are you really asking me

09:36.033 --> 09:38.202
to break every protocol
in the book so you can

09:38.244 --> 09:40.246
potentially interfere
with an ongoing investigation

09:40.288 --> 09:43.082
involving one
of your family members?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.251
[Carl] Uh...

09:45.293 --> 09:46.502
I'm fuckin' with you.
[laughs]

09:46.544 --> 09:48.754
I misuse this system
all the time.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.089
One of the perks of the job.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.050
G-A-L-L-A

09:53.092 --> 09:56.012
G-H-E-R.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.181
Hmm.
No arrest yet,

09:59.223 --> 10:01.601
but they are seeking
a warrant for his house.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.269
Just waitin' on
a judge's signature.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.854
[Carl] Shit.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.732
-[Stamps] Gallagher.
-Ah, ma'am.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.692
Do you know who my new
training officer's gonna be?

10:09.734 --> 10:11.360
[Stamps] Training officer?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.112
That's not gonna happen.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.448
No one wants to work with you
on account of the Carl Curse.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.449
[Carl] Ma'am?

10:16.490 --> 10:18.659
The Carl Curse.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.953
Everyone who trained you
ends up injured.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.456
You ever heard of
a lucky rabbit's foot?

10:23.497 --> 10:24.582
[Carl] Yeah.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.916
You're the opposite of that.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.127
Now, not all bad news.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.796
-I got you a new assignment.
-What is it?

10:30.838 --> 10:32.798
They just walked in.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.967
- exciting music
-Take off that uni

10:35.009 --> 10:36.636
and meet us outside.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.346
You're with Vice now.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.680
[Carl] Hell, yeah!

10:39.722 --> 10:42.183
God, how cool are they?

10:43.684 --> 10:45.936
-Damn it.
-[phone chimes]

10:48.314 --> 10:50.316
-[Kev] Oh, shit.
-[Amy] Bad word!

10:50.358 --> 10:53.986
I'm sorry, girls--I just got
an email from the Man.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.863
What do you think--
taxes, jury duty?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.406
Unpaid parking tickets?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.825
-Maybe it's a pizza party.
-[Kev] Life lesson.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.827
Emails from the government
are never awesome.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.663
They always suck.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.831
Here goes.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.668
[Amy] Is it a pizza party?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.169
Even better.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.962
A surprise for Mommy.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.506
Come on.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.425
mellow funk music

11:23.849 --> 11:26.352
Shit.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.354
Shit!

11:28.396 --> 11:29.605
Fuck.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.192
Tami, hey, it's Lip.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.360
We got a big fuckin' problem,
all right?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.528
Carl just told me that, um...

11:35.569 --> 11:37.154
[cop] Can you believe it?

11:37.196 --> 11:39.490
Uh...you know what?
Never mind.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.033
I'll just, uh...
I'll see ya at home.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.869
All right?
Bye.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.872
[Calista]
We're just goin' to my bar.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.999
You can wear
what you already have on.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.001
I wore this yesterday.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.338
If you don't like
anything I have...

11:54.380 --> 11:57.049
No! It's not that, I just--
I don't know.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.551
I wanna dress up a little.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.052
Always makes me feel better,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.846
which could definitely
help right now,

12:01.887 --> 12:03.514
considering my mood
borders on...

12:03.556 --> 12:04.849
homicidal rage.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.058
You wanna talk about it?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.143
[Debbie] What's to talk about?

12:07.184 --> 12:08.644
My life might be
a dumpster fire,

12:08.686 --> 12:11.480
but it doesn't mean
I can't look good.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.066
Hey, what's this?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.902
It's my ex, Haley's, old stuff.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.487
Cute

12:18.529 --> 12:20.364
Can I borrow some of it?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.199
Sure.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.743
Sweet.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.995
rock music

12:29.832 --> 12:32.293
funky music

12:32.334 --> 12:34.462
These are yours?

12:34.503 --> 12:36.922
Sure does look like it.
Get in.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.591
Can I drive?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.134
No.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.635
Hey, can you at least
tell me what we're doin'?

12:41.677 --> 12:44.597
- Dah dah dah
-[engines revving]

12:44.638 --> 12:47.266
Dah dah dah

12:47.308 --> 12:50.561
Dah dah
dah

12:50.603 --> 12:54.148
Dah dah-dah

12:59.779 --> 13:02.615
-Hey, you're up.
-Headed to my mom's.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.700
-Why?
-I'm gonna help her pack.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.577
Oh. You feelin' better
about her movin'?

13:06.619 --> 13:09.288
Uh, no. I'm gonna go steal
the keys to her U-Haul.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.623
Really?

13:10.664 --> 13:12.249
I should.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.920
But I decided to be
a supportive daughter instead.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.131
Gonna approach her leaving
with a positive attitude.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.466
Oh, positive.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.259
[Veronica] Yes, asshole.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.470
Positive, mature.
A ray of fucking sunshine.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.721
Why shouldn't I be?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.139
My mom's moving
halfway across the world.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.225
-Kentucky's not that far.
-Bye, Kev.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.560
Well, I was hoping we could
spend the afternoon together.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.437
I have the rest of my miserable
life to spend with you.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.731
-My mom leaves in two days.
-What time ya comin' back?

13:35.773 --> 13:37.942
When I feel like it!

13:37.983 --> 13:40.778
Askin' so many damn questions.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.821
[door slams]

13:41.862 --> 13:44.198
But why now?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.992
He touched those boys
decades ago.

13:47.034 --> 13:51.163
Doesn't cancel culture have
a statute of limitations?

13:51.205 --> 13:54.625
Mr. Gallagher, Dennis Hastert
no longer reflects our values.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.043
[Frank] The hell he doesn't!

13:56.085 --> 13:57.670
He was speaker of the House,

13:57.711 --> 13:59.505
third in line
for the presidency.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.966
He was a wrestling coach!

14:02.007 --> 14:05.344
How else are wrestling coaches
supposed to demonstrate holds

14:05.386 --> 14:08.722
if they don't...
grope some boys?

14:08.764 --> 14:11.809
-Context matters.
-Please keep your voice down.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.520
-[Liam] Can I go to class?
-Yes.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.439
[Frank] And...
w-why are you

14:17.481 --> 14:19.942
leaving it to the kids?
Kids are stupid.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.610
The school board
wanted the children

14:21.652 --> 14:23.863
to feel ownership and pride
in the new name.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.365
That's why the contest has been
limited to current students

14:26.407 --> 14:29.201
and alumni.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.536
[Frank] Alumni?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.454
I'm an alumnus!

14:32.496 --> 14:34.331
-[sighs] You are?
-[Frank] Hell, yes!

14:34.373 --> 14:36.750
Back when it was still
J. Edgar Hoover.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.879
Go, Feds.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.881
No, fuck you! F--

14:41.922 --> 14:44.717
Tough talk on the other end
of a phone, bitch.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.719
No, no, no, no--Michigan,
fuckin' China.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.761
It doesn't matter
where you hide out.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.388
I am gonna hunt you down.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.599
I'm gonna empty Terry's
shit bag in your fuckin' mouth,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.058
you piece of shit!

14:53.100 --> 14:54.602
[Ian] Cousin Joey?

14:54.643 --> 14:56.562
Dickhead just decided
to run off.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.772
Hidin' out with one of his
scumbag friends in Michigan,

14:58.814 --> 15:00.316
all so he can avoid
taking care of Terry.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.734
Fuckin' believe that?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.485
[Ian] I mean, it is Terry.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.738
Obviously, we can't rely
on family for this.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.573
We're gonna have to hire
someone to do it.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.617
Like with money?

15:09.658 --> 15:12.036
Yeah, get one of those
house nurses or whatever.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.163
[Ian] You wanna hire a nurse?

15:14.204 --> 15:15.789
I thought we were saving up
for our own place.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.499
Well, shit shifted.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.044
[Ian] Shit shifted to Terry.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.547
I have to worry about you?
The whole loyalty department?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.090
What?

15:25.132 --> 15:26.884
Yeah, when I'm too old
to wipe my own ass,

15:26.926 --> 15:28.761
you're gonna be over there
counting fuckin' pennies,

15:28.802 --> 15:30.387
decidin' whether or not
you can take care of me?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.348
-That's different.
-Family's family.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.936
Fine.
We'll find a fucking nurse.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.521
[Ian, under breath]
Wipe your ass.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.941
[funky background music]

15:41.982 --> 15:43.943
Ah.
I'll go for another.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.113
Hey, it's five o'clock
somewhere.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.907
[Calista] Ha.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.242
Anyone at home wondering
where you might be all day?

15:52.284 --> 15:54.495
Trust me,
they don't give a shit.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.539
[Calista] Hey, guys.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.084
Uh, sit anywhere you like.
I'll be right with you.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.671
You boys celebrating something?

16:03.712 --> 16:05.714
Uh...we're taking an extended

16:05.756 --> 16:07.549
and hopefully very boozy
lunch break

16:07.591 --> 16:10.010
so we can commemorate the day
this ugly bastard was born.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.428
[chuckles]

16:11.470 --> 16:13.430
That's so nice.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.890
How 'bout some shots
on the house?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.768
On the house?
No.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.021
I can do Happy Hour price
in honor of the birthday boy.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.606
Will you two do a shot
with us?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.400
I'm on the clock.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.818
Red?

16:25.859 --> 16:28.320
Pour 'em up.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.411
Tam!

16:35.452 --> 16:37.496
Yo, we gotta clear out
the boxes!

16:40.332 --> 16:41.625
[pounding on door]

16:41.667 --> 16:43.293
[Jones]  Police.
Open up!

16:43.335 --> 16:47.006
[pounding]

16:47.047 --> 16:50.592
[pounding continues]

16:50.634 --> 16:52.761
All right,
all right, all right!

16:52.803 --> 16:54.013
[Jones] Philip Gallagher,
we have a warrant

16:54.054 --> 16:55.681
to search the premises.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.808
Yeah, well, come on in.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.106
[Pitts] You know,
if I was a lifetime criminal

17:04.148 --> 17:06.525
motorcycle mechanic
who just stole

17:06.567 --> 17:08.068
a shitload of motorcycles,

17:08.110 --> 17:10.654
I might just be dumb enough

17:10.696 --> 17:12.823
to keep them in
the most obvious place.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.159
Where's your garage?

17:32.676 --> 17:34.219
[clanging]

17:38.682 --> 17:40.684
Well, shit,

17:40.726 --> 17:43.020
look, sorry, no stolen bikes,

17:43.062 --> 17:44.563
but, uh, you're welcome to take

17:44.605 --> 17:46.857
one of those
Christmas tree stands.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.193
I don't know
how we ended up with two.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.987
light guitar music

17:56.116 --> 17:58.660
-Keep these, right?
-Oh, no. Give away pile.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.579
What?
I love these.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.289
It's not Christmas
without these plates.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.625
Girl, they have been
in that box since 2007,

18:04.666 --> 18:06.251
which, coincidentally,
is the last time

18:06.293 --> 18:08.170
that we had dinner
at my house.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.589
What am I gonna do with
a Santa table setting for 12

18:10.631 --> 18:12.841
-in Louisville, huh?
-You are literally

18:12.883 --> 18:14.718
throwin' away everything.
What's the point?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.970
We should just back
a garbage truck in here

18:17.012 --> 18:18.222
and shovel everything in it.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.641
-Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
-Ma...

18:20.682 --> 18:24.645
this is my entire childhood,
all of our memories.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.313
Throw away the damn plates, V!

18:29.108 --> 18:31.443
Thought helping you,
hangin' out might be fun,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.070
but this shit is awful.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.863
-I thought we would talk!
-Excuse me.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.199
Had you asked instead of just
inviting yourself over,

18:37.241 --> 18:40.953
I would've told you that I'm
too busy to hang out and talk.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.956
Oh, shit...I gotta get
over to my storage unit.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.250
-I'll go with.
-Uh, no, thanks.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.127
-Why not?
-Because I've had enough

18:48.168 --> 18:49.878
of your company today.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.296
Look, I'm excited
about Louisville,

18:51.338 --> 18:52.881
and you killin' my vibe.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.967
I'm not dyin'.
I'm just movin'.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.594
So what?
Get over it.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.318
[Pablo] If it isn't
my favorite vice detectives.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.362
Man, you know I had to
bring you some dogs

19:15.404 --> 19:17.364
from downtown for later--
extra relish,

19:17.406 --> 19:19.491
-extra celery sauce.
-Aw...muah!

19:19.533 --> 19:21.076
You gentlemen are heroes.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.537
I can never make it all the way
downtown to get these.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.497
How're these fine machines
treatin' ya?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.374
Uh, she rides just
a little rough,

19:27.416 --> 19:29.376
but tell me what the story is
on that Viper over there.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.919
[Pablo] I need a few days
before I can

19:30.961 --> 19:32.713
-let ya take that one.
-[Young] What's wrong with it?

19:32.754 --> 19:34.047
Belonged to
a parks commissioner

19:34.089 --> 19:35.340
accused
of embezzling city funds.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.509
Blew his brains out
in the front seat.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.761
Still a mess on the dashboard.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.305
[laughter]

19:41.346 --> 19:42.848
[Carl] Yo, wait.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.017
So you guys just come here
and take whatever you want?

19:45.058 --> 19:46.518
[Hightower]
As long as it helps aid

19:46.560 --> 19:48.020
an ongoin' investigation.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.023
Or if we think it looks cool.
Ya got anything new?

19:51.064 --> 19:52.691
Glad you asked.
I been able to

19:52.733 --> 19:55.944
squirrel away a few things
for you gents.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.657
Act now,
before it's logged as evidence.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.327
Take what you want

20:03.368 --> 20:07.706
You gotta take
what you want

20:07.748 --> 20:10.709
Give it all you got

20:10.751 --> 20:12.628
Hey, barkeep!
Another.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.296
Take what you want...

20:14.338 --> 20:15.797
Let's make these your last.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.674
What? The day's young!

20:27.559 --> 20:29.686
I have some coke,

20:29.728 --> 20:32.022
if you're interested.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.861
[Pitts] All clear.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.739
-[Lip] Hey. Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.282
Uh, what's goin' on?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.243
[Lip] They think
I robbed Born Free.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.245
What? Ha.
Wait--you?

20:46.286 --> 20:47.579
No.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.706
Yeah.
Checked the whole house.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.167
But came up empty-handed,
'cause...

20:52.209 --> 20:54.461
I didn't do it.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.005
[Tami] Go ahead.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.423
Hey, and, uh, good luck,
you know,

20:58.465 --> 21:00.968
finding the real criminals,
guys.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.184
Lip, we need to talk, okay?

21:09.226 --> 21:11.436
-You cannot just--
-Shh, shh, shh.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.439
[car engine starts]

21:14.481 --> 21:17.442
You moved all the boxes
outta the garage?

21:17.484 --> 21:19.903
Well, they didn't move
themselves.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.280
Where'd you put 'em?

21:21.321 --> 21:24.032
[Tami] Uh,
in my dad's basement.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.952
[Lip] Hey.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.412
[Tami] Lip.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.957
Y-you can't put our family
in danger like this.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.126
You have Fred to think about.
You have me to think about.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.962
We can't have the cops just
showing up at our house and...

21:37.004 --> 21:38.797
hello!

21:40.507 --> 21:42.968
Are you even listening
to a word that I'm saying?

21:43.010 --> 21:45.262
Kay, why are you staring
at me like that?

21:45.304 --> 21:48.348
Sorry, sorry.
It's just, um...

21:48.390 --> 21:50.350
uh, I-I guess
this whole Gallagher thing

21:50.392 --> 21:53.687
is finally rubbin' off on ya.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.856
I didn't know
you had it in you.

21:55.897 --> 21:57.316
[Tami] Well...

21:57.357 --> 21:59.318
yeah, I...

21:59.359 --> 22:01.653
I didn't know I had it
in me either.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.406
You know, Carl called,

22:04.448 --> 22:07.326
told me about the warrant,
and I just...

22:07.367 --> 22:08.660
I just acted.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.746
It was like
something clicked in my brain,

22:10.787 --> 22:12.664
and I just went on autopilot.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.084
Does this make me
an accomplice?

22:16.126 --> 22:17.461
Accessory after the fact.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.920
Oh.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.511
It's kinda hot.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.430
[Lip] Yeah, it is.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.974
[Tami] I thought being
a criminal would be exciting,

22:31.016 --> 22:34.853
but I didn't know
that it would be...

22:34.895 --> 22:37.981
sexually exciting.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.567
-What about Fred?
-[Tami] He's out like a light.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.569
[whispers] We'll be quiet.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.863
[Lip] You? I doubt it.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.531
[Tami giggles]

22:46.573 --> 22:49.242
I'll just bite your shoulder
when I get the urge to scream.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.787
[giggling]

22:53.372 --> 22:55.540
I don't need a fuckin' nurse.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.042
[Mickey] You can't walk, Terry.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.418
You can't feed yourself.
You can't bathe yourself.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.003
You shit in a bag.
Stop me when any of this

23:00.045 --> 23:02.172
sounds like someone who doesn't
need a fuckin' nurse.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.548
Then just take me to the park.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.550
Leave me there
and let me die in peace.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.552
Oh, see, viable option.
Even Terry thinks so.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.638
[doorbell rings]

23:12.432 --> 23:15.060
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Jasmine.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.895
-You must be...
-Ian, yeah.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.397
Come on in.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.565
Mickey, Terry, this is Jasmine,

23:20.607 --> 23:22.484
Terry's in-home health aide.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.069
You got me a n--

23:24.111 --> 23:25.362
[Mickey, cheerfully] Nah--

23:25.404 --> 23:27.406
Nice lady to watch you
while we head to work.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.575
Yeah. You fuck this up,
I'ma cut your dick off.

23:30.617 --> 23:31.993
I wouldn't feel it anyway.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.995
[Jasmine] Don't you all worry.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.415
I'm gonna take good care
of Dad here.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.544
[Terry growls]

23:40.585 --> 23:43.463
Thanks. I know dealin' with
Terry is a pain in the ass.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.632
Fuckin' expensive,
but now I don't have

23:45.674 --> 23:48.093
to worry about anything.
I can focus on work--

23:49.678 --> 23:52.097
Just forgot something
in my car.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.809
rock music

23:55.851 --> 23:57.894
She's probably comin'
right back.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.147
[Ian] Yeah.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.612
Gallagher, look alive.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.656
All right, look,
I want you to

24:09.698 --> 24:11.575
make a buy off this guy,
all right?

24:11.616 --> 24:13.952
Quarter bag.
Ask for it "dusty."

24:13.994 --> 24:16.288
All right.
But I don't have any money.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.457
Here.
All right?

24:18.498 --> 24:20.208
[Young]
Hurry up.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.793
Look both ways
before you cross the street.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.253
[car horn honks]

24:23.295 --> 24:26.256
I'm putting bodies
on the board

24:26.298 --> 24:28.592
Like you've never seen
before...

24:28.633 --> 24:31.636
[Carl] Hey, man, I need a cop.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.888
Loud or reggie?

24:32.929 --> 24:36.099
Reggie. Quarter.
Make it dusty.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.726
60.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.394
Nah nah nah nah nah

24:39.436 --> 24:41.313
So when
you're in my sights

24:41.354 --> 24:42.939
Nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah

24:42.981 --> 24:45.984
Nah nah nah-nah-nah...

24:46.026 --> 24:47.486
Freeze, fucker!
You're under arrest.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.945
-Turn around.
-You're a cop?

24:48.987 --> 24:50.864
Hands on your head.
Face the wall!

24:50.906 --> 24:52.782
[Young] What the fuck
are you doing, kid?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.284
Making the arrest
like you said to.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.619
No, stupid asshole!
We told you to make a buy.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.995
No one said anything
about making an arrest.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.497
Apologize to this guy.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.832
Uh, I'm...sorry?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.542
[Young]
Keep the drugs, Gallagher.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.296
Let's get outta here, man.

25:06.338 --> 25:10.300
Come on!
Pulling guns out and shit!

25:12.344 --> 25:15.639
Oh, God, coke is fantastic.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.474
I know, right?
[sniffs]

25:17.516 --> 25:20.185
Yeah. I can see why people
become junkies

25:20.227 --> 25:22.020
and run away
from their responsibilities.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.480
-[sniffs]
-You know, for me,

25:23.522 --> 25:26.024
when it comes to drugs
versus, like, a job...pffft.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.359
Drugs win.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.818
[both chuckle]

25:28.860 --> 25:30.695
What kinda jobs have you had?

25:32.155 --> 25:35.200
Ah!
Let's see, uh, I was a nurse.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.619
I was
an elementary school teacher.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.204
Addiction counselor.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.665
That was fun.
Ha ha.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.667
Uh, and now,

25:43.708 --> 25:46.878
the, uh, assistant manager
at the illustrious

25:46.920 --> 25:49.714
Mailbox Unlimited
Copy and Shipping Center.

25:49.756 --> 25:51.758
Oh!
Impressive.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.928
Is coke supposed to
make you horny?

25:54.970 --> 25:56.763
'Cause I feel like
I need to...

25:56.805 --> 25:58.848
hump that box right there.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.351
[both laughing]

26:01.393 --> 26:03.937
[Jared clears throat]

26:06.356 --> 26:08.400
Ahem.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.320
I'm...gay.
[laughs]

26:12.362 --> 26:13.989
Me too!

26:14.030 --> 26:17.450
Well, I haven't...been
with a girl since high school.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.411
It's like riding a bike.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.496
Baby, don't you cry

26:21.538 --> 26:26.334
It's time for us
to say goodbye

26:26.376 --> 26:28.712
[Tommy] So all I gotta do
is put these decorations up,

26:28.753 --> 26:30.088
and I get free beer
for a week?

26:30.130 --> 26:31.756
[Kev] Ha. Nice try.
Two days.

26:31.798 --> 26:33.550
I don't know, man.
There's a lotta stuff in here.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.343
-Week seems reasonable.
-All right, fine.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.678
You know what?
I'll just ask Kermit.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.597
-He'll probably do it for free.
-Fine!

26:38.638 --> 26:40.932
I accept your lowball offer.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.435
Hey, babe!

26:43.476 --> 26:45.270
How are you?
You doin' good?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.230
Feelin' better
that you saw your mom?

26:47.272 --> 26:48.690
No. She had to get something
from storage,

26:48.732 --> 26:51.192
-so might as well work.
-Okay, well,

26:51.234 --> 26:53.445
how 'bout we get outta here,
do something to cheer you up?

26:53.486 --> 26:55.447
No, thanks.
Here to work.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.032
[Kermit]
How 'bout Ron Popeil?

26:57.073 --> 26:59.367
Ronco HQ was right down
the street.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.036
[Frank]
That's a great idea.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.454
Hugh Hefner Middle School, huh?

27:02.495 --> 27:04.789
-Think about it.
-Fellas. Ditka.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.791
Mike Ditka Middle School.
Contest over.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.959
-Ooh!
-What are you fools

27:08.001 --> 27:09.294
talkin' about?

27:09.336 --> 27:11.171
Frank's trying to name
his old junior high.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.922
Why does it need a new name?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.841
It doesn't.
That's the point.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.426
It was fine the way it was.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.136
-Hear, hear.
-Nevertheless,

27:18.178 --> 27:20.472
I need a surefire winner

27:20.513 --> 27:22.307
so it doesn't get coopted

27:22.349 --> 27:25.352
by a bunch of politically
correct millennial activists.

27:25.393 --> 27:28.563
Last thing I need
is my son attending

27:28.605 --> 27:32.859
Tofu Middle School of
Multicultural Granola Studies.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.486
What's it called now?

27:34.527 --> 27:36.613
Dennis Hastert Middle School.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.658
-The child molester?
-Former Speaker of the House.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.910
Why are you guys worried
about trying to protect

27:41.951 --> 27:44.245
some meaningless,
symbolic name anyway?

27:44.287 --> 27:46.164
How 'bout you try to protect
the real Chicago,

27:46.206 --> 27:47.666
the real South Side,

27:47.707 --> 27:50.126
the people and institutions
who make this town great?

27:50.168 --> 27:52.253
If you hadn't noticed, they're
being shut down every day.

27:52.295 --> 27:54.839
Because this renaming trend
is bullshit.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.424
It's just another way
for society

27:56.466 --> 27:58.468
to erase the hard work
of white guys.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.720
Because at some point,
and who knows why,

28:00.762 --> 28:02.931
being a white guy
suddenly became uncool.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.934
Or maybe white guys are finally
being held accountable

28:05.975 --> 28:07.977
for all of the horrible stuff
they've done,

28:08.019 --> 28:10.647
like child molestation,
for example.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.607
And you, in particular,
don't have to worry about

28:12.649 --> 28:14.943
when white men became uncool,
'cause as far as I can tell,

28:14.984 --> 28:17.153
you've always been...
whatever this is.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.197
-Ha ha ha.
-[Frank] Ho ho ho!

28:19.239 --> 28:20.740
And, Frank,
why waste your time?

28:20.782 --> 28:22.784
Liam's gonna be outta that
school and on to a high school

28:22.826 --> 28:25.412
with an equally problematic
name in no time.

28:25.453 --> 28:28.248
[Frank] They're trying to erase
the history of white men

28:28.289 --> 28:29.916
who built this great country.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.584
How far back are we going

28:31.626 --> 28:33.545
with this revisionist
history crusade?

28:33.586 --> 28:35.755
Do we have to reexamine Adam

28:35.797 --> 28:37.924
at the Garden of Eden?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.718
You think Adam was white?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.261
Ha ha ha.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.640
The point is,
I went to that school.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.394
Best years of my life
in those halls,

28:49.436 --> 28:51.896
in those classrooms.

28:51.938 --> 28:55.734
Year I played baseball,
we had a bully on the team.

28:55.775 --> 28:57.485
Johnny Wisneiwski.

28:57.527 --> 29:01.114
A big, fat bruiser.
He could hit a ball...

29:01.156 --> 29:02.866
almost a mile.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.285
If you made an error
in the game,

29:05.326 --> 29:08.371
Johnny was sure to use
the wet end of his towel

29:08.413 --> 29:10.540
to rattail your genitals
in the shower

29:10.582 --> 29:13.585
to remind you of how useless
you were.

29:13.626 --> 29:17.630
Everybody was scared to death
of big, fat Johnny Wisneiwski.

29:17.672 --> 29:21.301
Well, one day, he thwacked
my naked wet ass

29:21.342 --> 29:23.928
with that towel,
and I blew up.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.598
I pantsed him.
What do you think we saw?

29:26.639 --> 29:28.433
His dick.
I'm guessing you saw his dick.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.143
Not just any dick.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.520
The tiniest little button
of a pink dick

29:32.562 --> 29:33.813
you've ever laid your eyes on.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.191
And Johnny Wisneiwski's
reign of terror

29:36.232 --> 29:39.569
ended that very day,
thanks to yours truly.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.613
I was king after that.

29:41.654 --> 29:44.574
And all my kids went there.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.117
There are Gallagher memories

29:46.159 --> 29:49.788
embedded in every inch
of that school.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.290
Should probably be called--

29:53.958 --> 29:55.960
No.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.588
It should  definitely
be called

29:58.630 --> 30:00.799
Gallagher Middle School.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.843
Gallagher Middle School.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.223
Outstan--
Gallagher Middle School!

30:08.264 --> 30:10.558
Jesus! Of course!

30:10.600 --> 30:12.727
Whadda ya say we do this:

30:12.769 --> 30:15.313
we go pick up the girls,
we stop for expensive froyo

30:15.355 --> 30:17.482
with all the fancy toppings,
huh?

30:17.524 --> 30:19.567
How many times I have to
tell you I'm not in the mood?

30:19.609 --> 30:21.236
I know, but I think today
could be really special

30:21.277 --> 30:23.613
if we let it be.
It would make me happy,

30:23.655 --> 30:25.323
and I'm pretty sure
it could make you happy too.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.700
Please.
For me.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.537
The love of your life.

30:30.578 --> 30:34.123
[small laugh]
[softly] Fuckin' froyo.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.543
[Veronica sighs]

30:39.379 --> 30:43.341
[both sigh, chuckle]

30:43.383 --> 30:45.051
[Tami] Ohh...

30:45.093 --> 30:47.846
Hey, I'm gonna take a shower.

30:47.887 --> 30:50.181
And while I'm in there...

30:50.223 --> 30:51.558
[Lip] Yep?

30:51.599 --> 30:53.476
Think up our next caper.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.019
-Caper?
-[giggles]

30:55.061 --> 30:58.106
-[Lip] You a Batman villain?
-Uh, more like Bonnie.

30:58.147 --> 31:00.525
You know, Bonnie and Clyde?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.527
Yeah.
Think I mighta heard of them.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.612
[Tami] Something where
we almost get caught

31:04.654 --> 31:06.781
but then we get away with it.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.950
[Lip] We could...

31:08.992 --> 31:11.870
-pull a bank robbery.
-Or a jewel heist.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.122
I mean...

31:14.163 --> 31:16.708
I would consider
murder for hire.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.835
[Lip laughs]

31:18.877 --> 31:20.461
Hey, uh,

31:20.503 --> 31:23.882
gotta go to this thing Liam's
doing at his school later.

31:23.923 --> 31:26.009
-Mm-hmm.
-[Lip] Wanna come?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.886
Yeah, yeah, I suppose
I can pretend to be

31:27.927 --> 31:29.721
a law-abiding citizen
for the night.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.556
[phone chiming]

31:31.598 --> 31:33.433
Oh.

31:33.474 --> 31:36.436
Hey, Cami.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.063
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.107
Slow down.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.067
He was crying?
About what?

31:43.109 --> 31:44.903
-I'm confused.
-[Lip] What?

31:46.446 --> 31:48.740
The cops?

31:48.781 --> 31:50.116
They want Brad to come in
for questioning? When?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.743
[Lip]
No, no, he's gonna crack.

31:51.784 --> 31:55.079
rock music

31:55.121 --> 31:56.581
He's on his way
to the station now?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.207
-Uh, when did he leave?
-[Lip] Shit, shit! Fuck!

31:59.459 --> 32:01.628
This lady should work.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.713
Terry doesn't have a problem
with Asian people, does he?

32:03.755 --> 32:05.214
I mean, I don't know.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.050
He likes a lot of Chinese food
and Bruce Lee movies.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.927
Found his porn stash once
when we were kids.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.845
Had a pretty decent amount
of Asian chicks in it.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.597
Then we got nothin'
to worry about.

32:12.639 --> 32:13.932
We should just get goin'.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.892
All right, the agency
said this one's tough?

32:15.934 --> 32:18.436
Yeah. Said she's one of those
Vietnamese boat people.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.605
Doesn't get much tougher
than that.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.525
[speaking dialect
of Vietnamese]

32:33.993 --> 32:35.536
Maybe I should ask the agency

32:35.578 --> 32:37.080
for somebody white
this time, huh?

32:37.121 --> 32:39.624
Yep.

32:42.001 --> 32:45.088
-[Carl] This place is legal.
-[Hightower] Yeah, it is.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.590
So then why you want me
to buy from them, then?

32:47.632 --> 32:50.468
[Young] Listen, this detail

32:50.510 --> 32:52.011
is a golden elevator.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.930
It'll take you
right to the top,

32:53.972 --> 32:55.473
wherever you wanna go.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.475
What're you thinking?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.477
-SWAT?
-[Carl] Oh, shit.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.646
Grenades?
Assault rifles?

33:01.688 --> 33:03.773
-I love SWAT.
-That's only gonna happen

33:03.815 --> 33:05.608
if we give you
a good recommendation,

33:05.650 --> 33:06.985
and we're only gonna do that

33:07.026 --> 33:10.238
if you do what we say,
no questions.

33:10.279 --> 33:13.324
You wanna ride that golden
elevator, don't you?

33:13.366 --> 33:14.659
Yes, sir, I do.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.160
Good boy.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.746
Go make the buy.

33:18.788 --> 33:22.458
Uh, sirs, quick question.
Why me?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.085
You know, like, out of
all the rookies in the city,

33:24.127 --> 33:25.586
why pick me?

33:25.628 --> 33:27.964
While your personal
assessment indicates

33:28.006 --> 33:30.591
that you might ask
a lotta fuckin' questions,

33:30.633 --> 33:33.761
you're likely to accept
anything we tell you is true.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.013
Huh.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.848
Roger that.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.434
upbeat music

33:49.360 --> 33:52.655
[indistinct chatter]

33:52.697 --> 33:54.741
[Calista] Hey, have you guys
seen my friend Debbie?

33:54.782 --> 33:56.909
Redhead, had a little
too much to drink?

33:56.951 --> 33:58.453
-No?
- Look at me, one, two

33:58.494 --> 34:00.621
Three, one, two, three

34:00.663 --> 34:03.332
[both moaning]

34:05.209 --> 34:07.336
Debbie?

34:07.378 --> 34:10.298
Jared?
What the fuck?

34:10.339 --> 34:12.967
-Who is that?
-My husband.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.178
Ah ah ah ah ah...

34:15.219 --> 34:16.554
[Calista] Debbie, wait.
Come inside.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.890
Let's talk.
Debbie!

34:21.768 --> 34:23.478
[Terry] Where'd
your butt buddy go?

34:23.519 --> 34:25.354
To pick up your next victim.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.565
-I don't need no nurse.
-Well, maybe if you weren't

34:27.607 --> 34:29.984
such a ragin' asshole,
your family'd take care of you,

34:30.026 --> 34:32.987
and we wouldn't have to pay
someone to be nice to ya.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.073
[groans]
Ugh.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.658
-That tastes like dog food!
-Keep complainin',

34:37.700 --> 34:38.993
I will feed you dog food
for real.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.495
Ugh.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.704
Oh, no, no--

34:41.746 --> 34:43.998
-Come--
-Mm-mm.

34:48.586 --> 34:51.380
You woulda probably made
a half-decent son

34:51.422 --> 34:54.383
if it wasn't for
that whole fudge packer thing.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.639
Well, you probably woulda made
a half-decent dad

34:59.680 --> 35:02.183
if it weren't for the whole...

35:02.225 --> 35:05.436
racist, homophobic, beatin'
the shit outta me thing.

35:22.453 --> 35:25.581
Have a good one.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.126
Good work, kid.

35:28.167 --> 35:31.045
[murmuring]

35:31.087 --> 35:33.381
Oh, wait--there's
a lotta street weed in there.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.384
You contaminated
the evidence now.

35:36.425 --> 35:39.554
-You're mixing it up!
-Naw, man!

35:39.595 --> 35:42.056
Your eyes is playin'
tricks on you, kid.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.269
[Carl] You're literally
doing it on purpose.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.437
Why?
Oh, come on.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.148
I deserve to know
what I'm involved in.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.816
The weed you bought
on the street

35:51.858 --> 35:53.317
was laced with angel dust.

35:53.359 --> 35:54.944
Now the dispensary weed is too.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.989
So now we can file criminal
charges against the dispensary.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.574
Why?

35:59.615 --> 36:01.951
Because the legal weed is
cutting into our bottom line.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.542
If legal dispensaries put all
the street dealers outta work,

36:09.584 --> 36:11.294
what's left for us, huh?

36:11.335 --> 36:13.588
You know how much we make
off of kickback in bribes

36:13.629 --> 36:15.464
-from street dealers?
-But isn't that wrong?

36:15.506 --> 36:17.341
[Young]
Paid for my boat.

36:17.383 --> 36:19.302
It paid for
my second mistress's

36:19.343 --> 36:20.761
first Brazilian butt lift.

36:20.803 --> 36:22.930
[Young] We frame legal shops,
we shut 'em down,

36:22.972 --> 36:24.891
we get more illegal weed
back on the street.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.559
More illegal weed
equals more dealers,

36:26.601 --> 36:29.520
more dealers equals
more cash in our pockets.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.191
So, really, it's up to you,
Gallagher.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.817
You want some kickbacks?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.777
[Youngblood] Or you wanna spend
the rest of your career

36:36.819 --> 36:39.614
bustin' your hump,
poundin' a beat?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.285
Fine.
Let me help.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.871
Good. So how many more
dispensaries

36:46.913 --> 36:48.873
do we gotta put
outta business today?

36:48.915 --> 36:50.708
Uh looks like five.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.793
Next up is Dank Dorm,

36:52.835 --> 36:54.962
then New Leaf Collective,
Heavy Fog,

36:55.004 --> 36:56.714
New Heights,
and last but not least,

36:56.756 --> 36:58.591
The Alibi Room.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.843
[Youngblood]
All right, let's get it.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.973
-[Lip] Brad's not pickin' up.
-Well, this is the station

37:06.015 --> 37:08.017
closest to his house,
so if he's going anywhere,

37:08.059 --> 37:09.518
it's here.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.354
Think he can hold up
under an interrogation?

37:11.395 --> 37:12.855
Hell, no.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.317
Wait.
There he is. Okay.

37:16.359 --> 37:19.403
All right, do what you gotta do
to keep him quiet.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.032
[Lip] Hey, man.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.534
Brad?

37:25.576 --> 37:27.119
Brad.
Brad! H--

37:27.161 --> 37:29.830
punchy music

37:29.872 --> 37:30.998
Brad! Brad!

37:33.251 --> 37:35.044
[Brad] Ah! Let me go!

37:35.086 --> 37:36.712
Get off me!
I'm gonna confess!

37:36.754 --> 37:37.755
[Lip] Shh, shh!

37:37.797 --> 37:38.839
Let me go!
It's the only way!

37:38.881 --> 37:40.341
Shut the fuck up, all right?

37:40.383 --> 37:43.177
Talk to us.
We only wanna talk, all right?

37:50.601 --> 37:53.604
Go, go, go!

37:53.646 --> 37:55.439
Just in here.

37:55.481 --> 37:58.609
Terry,
this is Sister Mary Luke.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.611
[Mary Luke] Oh,
just Mary Luke is fine.

38:00.653 --> 38:03.864
My days in a habit
are long gone.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.995
You must be Terry.

38:09.036 --> 38:10.955
I should warn you,
he's been a handful today.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.957
You idiots got me
a fuckin' nun?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.625
-[hard smack]
-Watch your language

38:14.667 --> 38:16.335
in the presence of ladies.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.878
-Jesus Christ, lady!
-[hard smack]

38:17.920 --> 38:20.798
[Mary Luke] And we'll not take
the Lord's name in vain.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.676
Before the diocese
shut my convent down,

38:23.718 --> 38:26.178
I was tending
to the elderly sisters.

38:26.220 --> 38:29.265
Sister Cecilia had dementia

38:29.307 --> 38:32.351
and a colorful vocabulary.

38:32.393 --> 38:37.273
I found that a-a swift smack
usually fixed her behavior.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.985
-Yeah, that works for me.
-Solid strategy.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.129
[door opens]

39:00.171 --> 39:01.964
There he is!

39:02.006 --> 39:04.050
I have an exciting offer
for you.

39:04.091 --> 39:07.345
I'd like to give you a chance
to abandon your lame entry

39:07.386 --> 39:10.348
into the name change contest
and join forces with me.

39:10.389 --> 39:14.226
-Why would I do that?
-Because I'm gonna win.

39:14.268 --> 39:18.439
The Francis Gallagher
and Children Middle School.

39:18.481 --> 39:21.400
Thanks, but no thanks.
I really want that iPad.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.986
I don't give a damn
about the iPa--

39:24.028 --> 39:26.572
well, I mean, if we won,
we'd pawn it,

39:26.614 --> 39:29.742
and I'd take a cut,
but that's not the point.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.828
We have to preserve
the-the Gallagher legacy.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.665
We'd never be forgotten.
We'd be immortal.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.168
Yeah, I'm good, man.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.089
I'm-I'm not gonna make
this offer again.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.176
Well, suit yourself.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.055
I have to hit the head.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.104
No TP in there.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.369
You know, I-I wanna--

40:13.411 --> 40:15.746
I wanted to talk to you
about somethin'.

40:17.456 --> 40:20.501
I think we should team up
on the name change contest.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.169
Now, b-before you say no,

40:22.211 --> 40:24.880
I should tell you
what my idea is.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.425
The Francis Gallagher
and Children Middle School.

40:27.466 --> 40:30.094
You literally just told me this
30 seconds ago.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.304
I did?

40:33.180 --> 40:35.933
-What'd you say?
-No, Frank!

40:35.975 --> 40:37.435
Hmm.

40:38.644 --> 40:39.812
Hmm.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.865
[Frank]  No toilet paper
in here.

40:52.825 --> 40:55.786
No way, dude--Veronica'll
put my nuts in a table vice.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.621
Yeah, well, if you don't
get rid of their weed,

40:57.663 --> 40:59.373
-she'll be in jail.
-[Tommy]  Okay, I'll tell them

40:59.415 --> 41:00.958
if I see them,
but there's no way

41:01.000 --> 41:03.627
I'm touching their product
without talking to them first.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.133
[Carl] Hey,
what was that last place

41:09.175 --> 41:10.468
we were supposed to hit today?

41:10.509 --> 41:12.595
The A-Alibi Room?

41:12.636 --> 41:14.638
I think that's it, right?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.724
Well, if it's the place
I'm thinkin' of,

41:16.765 --> 41:18.225
it's really not worth
bustin'--

41:18.267 --> 41:21.312
low-rent, mom/pop spot,
couple of stale weed brownies,

41:21.353 --> 41:23.314
nickel bags--
we shouldn't waste our time.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.649
The list is the list.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.151
We got three more
after lunch,

41:27.193 --> 41:29.153
and then it's on to--
what'd you call it?

41:29.195 --> 41:31.363
The Alibi Room.

41:38.370 --> 41:42.791
[phone chiming]

41:44.043 --> 41:45.336
Hello.

41:45.377 --> 41:47.838
What?
For how long?

41:47.880 --> 41:49.673
I had no idea.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.175
Someone else
was supposed to pick her up--

41:51.217 --> 41:53.010
m-my girlfriend.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.845
Well, I-I'm so sorry,

41:54.887 --> 41:57.306
but I can promise you
that I would never abandon

41:57.348 --> 41:59.642
my daughter at school.
I was at work, I--

41:59.683 --> 42:01.101
When you're
a single working mother

42:01.143 --> 42:04.313
trying to provide for a kid,
things like this happen.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.773
Hello?

42:05.814 --> 42:07.191
Hi, Franny.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.193
Mommy's on her way, honey.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.819
I know.
Mommy misses you too, honey.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.113
I'll be right there.

42:13.155 --> 42:14.448
[passerby]
Hey, baby, I got something

42:14.490 --> 42:17.034
that'll put a smile
on your face...right here.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.872
You know what?
Actually, I would love that.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.208
For real?

42:24.250 --> 42:26.210
Oh--fuck! Uhh--

42:26.252 --> 42:29.004
punchy music

42:31.423 --> 42:34.385
You just checked your messages,
like, two minutes ago.

42:34.426 --> 42:35.970
And shouldn't you be
keeping a look out

42:36.011 --> 42:38.889
in case someone tries to, like,
rob us or somethin'?

42:38.931 --> 42:40.182
You think she knows
how to insert

42:40.224 --> 42:41.058
the little piss tube thing--

42:41.100 --> 42:43.185
The catheter, yes.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.062
Maybe I should just
give her a call,

42:45.104 --> 42:46.897
make sure everything's okay.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.857
We're finally
getting work done.

42:48.899 --> 42:52.736
Can we please just concentrate
for a couple more hours?

42:52.778 --> 42:54.071
Thank you.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.033
Maybe we should swing by
after the next stop,

42:58.075 --> 43:00.244
you know,
make sure she's okay.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.125
[Young]
And another one bites the dust.

43:06.166 --> 43:08.669
[Hightower] Yes, one more down,
and it is Miller time!

43:08.711 --> 43:11.171
Alibi Room--let's finish it
off strong, boys.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.007
[Young] Hop in, kid.
Time's a-wastin'.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.592
Uh, hey, can I drive?

43:14.633 --> 43:15.843
-[both chuckle]
-[Young] No.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.678
Come on, you guys've been
driving all day.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.430
Polishing your aviators,
workin' on your tan,

43:19.471 --> 43:21.056
while I've been doin'
all the work.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.433
-Yeah, so?
-I've never driven

43:22.474 --> 43:23.559
a Ferrari before.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.394
I wanna feel
some Italian horsepower.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.688
This might be my only chance.

43:29.982 --> 43:32.276
All right, son.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.737
Let's see what you got.

43:39.658 --> 43:42.202
[Hightower]
Long as it ain't mine.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.959
But w-we gotta turn--
turn ourselves in.

43:49.001 --> 43:50.961
No, no. If the cops
thought you knew anything,

43:51.003 --> 43:52.796
they would've come, and they
would've picked you up.

43:52.838 --> 43:55.674
Th-they called me to come
down for questioning, Lip.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.509
-They know!
-They don't know shit.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.345
[Brad]
I wanna come clean, okay?

43:59.386 --> 44:01.972
Ma-make some kinda deal
and return all the stuff.

44:02.014 --> 44:03.182
-[Lip] You wanna make a deal?
-Yeah.

44:03.223 --> 44:04.808
You're gonna fuck both of us,
okay?

44:04.850 --> 44:06.477
There's no way that
they're gonna believe

44:06.518 --> 44:08.145
that you stole all that shit
by yourself.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.272
Well, I-I won't give up you
or Mickey!

44:10.314 --> 44:12.358
-I swear!
-Uh, Lip,

44:12.399 --> 44:14.818
help me make a bottle
for Fred in the kitchen.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.945
-Now.
-Yeah.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.989
[Tami]
He is not gonna last

44:19.031 --> 44:21.325
five minutes with the cops.

44:23.285 --> 44:24.578
You need to do something.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.246
Do something?
Like what?

44:26.288 --> 44:28.457
Get rid of the evidence,
for starters!

44:28.499 --> 44:30.084
I haven't found a place
to sell the parts yet.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.502
Okay, let's just wait
for the ideal buyer

44:31.543 --> 44:32.836
while the cops close in!

44:32.878 --> 44:34.463
-Cops aren't closing in.
-[Tami] They will be!

44:34.505 --> 44:36.965
Okay? As soon as they get
Brad in a room at the station

44:37.007 --> 44:39.677
and he starts crying
and confessing...

44:41.720 --> 44:44.264
I don't know,
maybe we should just...

44:44.306 --> 44:46.433
take care of him.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.519
Take--meaning what, exactly?

44:48.560 --> 44:50.354
Meaning...

44:50.396 --> 44:52.981
take  care  of him.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.401
Wow, this whole, uh,
life of crime thing for you

44:55.442 --> 44:57.319
is gettin' a little bit
outta hand,

44:57.361 --> 44:59.196
-don't ya think, Capone?
-No! No, because he is

44:59.238 --> 45:00.906
gonna get everyone busted.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.449
I am involved now, okay?

45:02.491 --> 45:05.035
Who is gonna raise Fred
if we both end up in jail?

45:05.077 --> 45:07.746
[Brad sniffling]

45:11.333 --> 45:13.001
Okay, yeah, he does seem
a little bit fragile.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.129
Oh, yeah, no shit!

45:15.170 --> 45:17.881
We can't let him
out of our sight.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.513
Fuck!

45:28.016 --> 45:30.144
I need to take a rain check
on family bar night.

45:30.185 --> 45:32.146
What?

45:32.187 --> 45:34.481
No, no, no, no.
You love family bar night.

45:34.523 --> 45:36.066
-Cartoons on the TV...
-[Amy] I love cartoons.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.735
-The pizza.
-[Gemma] I love pizza.

45:37.776 --> 45:39.737
All the soda the girls
can drink--come on, V.

45:39.778 --> 45:41.864
I appreciate your trying
to cheer me up,

45:41.905 --> 45:43.407
but I just wanna go home
and take a nap.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.409
You can close up
by yourself, right?

45:45.451 --> 45:47.077
-Come on, girls.
-No, wait, I'm sorry,

45:47.119 --> 45:48.746
but I can't let you go.

45:48.787 --> 45:50.748
[Carol] Sorry I'm late!

45:50.789 --> 45:52.082
Ma?

45:52.124 --> 45:54.543
-I-is that your wedding dress?
-[Carol] Yeah.

45:54.585 --> 45:57.588
I just pulled it
out of storage...for you.

45:57.629 --> 45:59.882
-For me?
-[Carol] Mm-hmm.

45:59.923 --> 46:02.092
What's goin' on?

46:02.134 --> 46:04.928
It's not family bar night.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.847
It was never family bar night.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.057
You remember how we wanted
to get married at City Hall,

46:09.099 --> 46:11.393
but they cancelled everything
'cause of the shutdown?

46:11.435 --> 46:13.395
Well, they're clearing
their backlog.

46:13.437 --> 46:16.023
They're doing weddings
on Zoom.

46:16.064 --> 46:19.318
upbeat bluesy music

46:31.079 --> 46:35.292
How many years...

46:35.334 --> 46:37.628
-We're gettin' married?
-Yes.

46:37.669 --> 46:39.463
Right now?

46:39.505 --> 46:42.424
Right now.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.135
Seem to blind me

46:51.016 --> 46:53.894
-You good?
-Yeah. Don't I seem good?

46:53.936 --> 46:56.063
You're drivin'
like my grandma.

46:56.104 --> 46:58.482
Thought you wanted to feel
some Italian horsepower.

46:58.524 --> 47:00.442
I'm just being cautious.

47:00.484 --> 47:01.985
[laughs] There's cautious,

47:02.027 --> 47:03.779
and then there's
whatever this is.

47:03.821 --> 47:04.822
Giddy up, kid.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.367
[engine revving]

47:08.408 --> 47:10.035
That a boy.

47:10.077 --> 47:13.080
rock music

47:13.121 --> 47:14.832
Okay.

47:14.873 --> 47:17.209
All right, that's enough.

47:18.335 --> 47:21.255
That's enough, kid.

47:21.296 --> 47:23.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!
Slow the fuck down!

47:23.382 --> 47:25.384
I don't know what's going on.
It's outta control!

47:25.425 --> 47:27.302
Brake, brake, brake!

47:29.054 --> 47:31.223
Oh...what the fuck?

47:31.265 --> 47:35.185
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

47:35.227 --> 47:36.645
Piece of shit!

47:36.687 --> 47:38.021
[Hightower]
Man, what the hell?

47:38.063 --> 47:40.190
-[Young] You fuck!
-[Hightower] I told you

47:40.232 --> 47:42.526
don't let Billie Eilish
drive the car!

47:47.656 --> 47:49.616
Mommy'll be right up, baby.

47:56.582 --> 47:58.792
[Sandy] Rough day?

48:00.168 --> 48:02.129
I didn't expect you
to be here.

48:02.170 --> 48:05.424
[Sandy] No, I wasn't.
I left.

48:05.465 --> 48:07.926
But then I came back,
because I thought

48:07.968 --> 48:11.013
I should tell you to your face
how big of a bitch you are.

48:13.849 --> 48:16.351
[sighs] Mission accomplished.

48:19.146 --> 48:23.358
You know, we both said
some things we shouldn't have.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.736
But I'm open
to talking it out.

48:28.071 --> 48:30.240
I'm not.

48:30.282 --> 48:32.367
What do you mean?

48:32.409 --> 48:35.871
I don't think I could be
with a person like you, Sandy.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.081
A person like me.
Wow.

48:38.123 --> 48:40.042
You left your kid.

48:42.544 --> 48:45.339
So what did you do last night
and then again all day today?

48:45.380 --> 48:47.341
-Is that not the same, or--
-I blew off some steam

48:47.382 --> 48:48.842
for less than a day.

48:48.884 --> 48:50.844
And it sucked,
and now I'm back.

48:50.886 --> 48:52.387
With my kid.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.556
Can you say the same
about you and Prince?

48:54.598 --> 48:57.100
No, that is not fair.
I told you why I left Prince.

48:57.142 --> 48:58.602
-I was 15 years old.
-Oh, my God.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.812
I've heard
all of your excuses, Sandy,

49:00.854 --> 49:03.273
and they sound great
coming out of your mouth.

49:03.315 --> 49:05.275
But at the end of the day,

49:05.317 --> 49:08.111
you walked out on somebody
that needed you.

49:08.153 --> 49:11.031
I've got my entire family
trying to leave me.

49:11.073 --> 49:13.700
I don't need to be worried
about you too.

49:30.258 --> 49:32.469
[whispers] You fucking...

49:40.394 --> 49:42.479
You should see the scene
out there.

49:42.521 --> 49:46.108
Some idiot drove his Ferrari
into a parked car.

49:46.149 --> 49:49.069
What, she's not ready yet?
We're gonna miss our time slot.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.487
[door closes]

49:51.947 --> 49:54.908
[mellow pop playing]

50:05.210 --> 50:07.337
-Is this dress too much?
-Excuse me?

50:07.379 --> 50:09.506
-What's wrong with my dress?
-[Kev] Nothin'.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.634
It's perfect.

50:16.888 --> 50:18.849
Are we really doing this?

50:18.890 --> 50:21.184
I think so.

50:21.226 --> 50:23.603
[Carol] Dominic!
No, honey,

50:23.645 --> 50:26.690
look, that is for
after they get married.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.192
Kay?
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

50:29.234 --> 50:31.820
I think they're ready
for y'all.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.871
Yes, sir, I'm ready.

50:40.912 --> 50:43.206
Me too.

50:43.248 --> 50:45.042
[Sandy] Dominic!

50:45.083 --> 50:47.210
I'm gonna beat
your little ass--sit down!

50:48.420 --> 50:49.880
Yes, sir.

50:53.300 --> 50:55.052
We'll just check in on him
real quick,

50:55.093 --> 50:56.553
and then we got to get
to Liam's school.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.055
-We're already late.
-In and out, all right?

50:58.096 --> 50:59.389
I promise.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.726
[Ian] Where's Terry?

51:02.768 --> 51:05.729
Your father...
he's an evil man.

51:05.771 --> 51:07.397
No shit.
What're you doin' out here?

51:07.439 --> 51:09.149
I had to handle him
the same way

51:09.191 --> 51:11.026
I handled Sister Cecilia.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.402
Yeah, the slap to the back
of the head thing, right?

51:12.444 --> 51:15.197
-[Mary Luke] No.
-What? Like drugs?

51:15.238 --> 51:17.157
-Fuckin' loves those.
-[Mary Luke] No.

51:17.199 --> 51:20.077
A return to sit at the feet
of our Lord and Savior

51:20.118 --> 51:22.913
in death.

51:22.954 --> 51:25.707
funky music

51:27.584 --> 51:29.503
Sorry, did you just say death?

51:40.138 --> 51:44.810
[applause]

51:45.393 --> 51:48.980
Okay, we'll now take a minute
to consider the suggestion

51:49.022 --> 51:52.359
of Mahatma Gandhi
Academy of Peace.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.153
[Carl] What's up, buddy?

51:55.195 --> 51:56.822
Where is everybody?

51:56.863 --> 51:59.908
[scoffs] Fuck 'em.
What'd I miss?

51:59.950 --> 52:01.618
[Liam] They already rejected

52:01.660 --> 52:02.994
Martin Luther King
Middle School

52:03.036 --> 52:05.288
because MLK was a womanizer.

52:05.330 --> 52:06.873
Then they rejected
Barack Obama

52:06.915 --> 52:09.543
because of his "use of drones
in the Middle East."

52:09.584 --> 52:10.961
They even said no
to Michael Jordan.

52:11.002 --> 52:12.379
Whoa, the GOAT?

52:12.420 --> 52:14.798
His gambling sets
a bad example.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.300
[Carl] Tough crowd.

52:17.342 --> 52:20.262
Hey, why's Frank
sittin' over there?

52:20.303 --> 52:22.389
Said if I'm not with him,
I'm against him.

52:22.430 --> 52:24.141
I guess we're enemies.

52:24.182 --> 52:26.810
[Lily] Unfortunately, I don't
think we can further consider

52:26.852 --> 52:29.563
Mahatma Gandhi Academy
of Peace.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.398
We've been made aware of

52:31.439 --> 52:33.483
some problematic
century-old comments

52:33.525 --> 52:36.319
Mr. Gandhi made
about Black Africans.

52:36.361 --> 52:39.322
They're...disqualifying.

52:39.364 --> 52:42.200
Up next to propose
a new name,

52:42.242 --> 52:44.161
Francis Gallagher,

52:44.202 --> 52:46.997
class of 1968.

52:48.707 --> 52:52.711
Uh...thank you,
madam...president.

52:52.752 --> 52:55.130
Thank you.
What I'd like to, uh,

52:55.172 --> 52:58.175
to talk about today...
[clears throat]

52:58.216 --> 53:00.051
...is, um...

53:02.345 --> 53:06.308
Obviously,
I'm here to address,

53:06.349 --> 53:08.685
uh, t-the--uh...

53:09.644 --> 53:12.397
I would like to address,
uh, the...

53:14.816 --> 53:16.359
Uh...gimme a second.

53:16.401 --> 53:19.446
It'll come to me.
[chuckling]

53:19.487 --> 53:22.157
I can't seem to remember
what I had to say.

53:22.199 --> 53:23.700
Um, I don't think...

53:26.745 --> 53:29.122
Memory's funny, isn't it?
It's like...

53:29.164 --> 53:30.665
sand through your fingers.

53:30.707 --> 53:33.710
Sometimes you can grab it,
and sometimes...

53:35.086 --> 53:38.048
That damn fragile thing,
it's...

53:41.092 --> 53:43.470
...all that'll be left of us.

53:43.511 --> 53:45.722
All of us, at some point...

53:48.099 --> 53:51.102
Just a memory.

53:51.144 --> 53:54.272
And let me tell ya,
if you haven't made a mark,

53:54.314 --> 53:58.568
now, while you're kickin'...

53:58.610 --> 54:00.779
you don't even get that.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.491
Uh...

54:04.532 --> 54:05.784
uh...

54:14.709 --> 54:16.586
Johnny?

54:18.046 --> 54:20.507
Johnny Wisneiwski?

54:20.548 --> 54:22.008
Hey!

54:22.050 --> 54:24.427
Why don't you show everybody
your little baby dick?

54:24.469 --> 54:25.845
-[laughter]
-Come on!

54:25.887 --> 54:28.014
I-I know the rest of the team

54:28.056 --> 54:30.350
would really get
a kick outta that, huh?

54:30.392 --> 54:32.769
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll go first.

54:32.811 --> 54:34.854
-Okay? Come on, Johnny.
-[commotion]

54:34.896 --> 54:36.940
-[Lily] Mr. Gallagher--
-[Carl] Hey, hey, back up!

54:36.982 --> 54:39.109
That's my dad, asshole!
CPD!

54:43.154 --> 54:45.115
[Ian] What'd Frank do
this time?

54:45.156 --> 54:47.075
He really lost it today.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.953
Stripped naked at Liam's school
in front of a bunch of kids.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.247
Only thing I could do to
prevent him from going to jail

54:52.289 --> 54:54.624
was badging everyone there,
taking him to the ER.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.793
[Debbie] He's still getting
evaluated.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.503
Debs, you okay?

54:58.545 --> 55:01.131
I've had a day.

55:02.507 --> 55:04.843
-[Lip] Yeah.
-[Carl] Yeah.

55:04.884 --> 55:06.803
[Ian] I guess
that makes all of us.

55:06.845 --> 55:09.723
A nun killed Mickey's dad.

55:09.764 --> 55:12.434
Terry's dead?

55:12.475 --> 55:14.102
[Ian] As a doornail.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.313
[Debbie] Damn! A nun?

55:16.354 --> 55:20.859
God really does work in
mysterious ways, doesn't she?

55:21.943 --> 55:24.321
Hey, sorry I missed your thing.

55:24.362 --> 55:26.823
Terry's dying kinda threw
a wrench in our schedule.

55:26.865 --> 55:30.493
-How'd it go?
-I think I did all right.

55:31.369 --> 55:32.662
-Whoa!
-Hey!

55:32.704 --> 55:34.080
-Shit, man!
-Nice!

55:34.122 --> 55:35.999
[Lip] What name did ya
end up pitching?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.917
Well, when I realized
they had a problem

55:37.959 --> 55:40.837
with every famous person's name
that anybody suggested,

55:40.879 --> 55:42.839
I just thought
I'll play it safe,

55:42.881 --> 55:45.842
so from now on, it's just gonna
be called The Middle School.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.969
Nice one, man.

55:48.011 --> 55:49.262
[Lip] Hi.

55:52.015 --> 55:53.433
What's going on?

55:53.475 --> 55:55.101
-Where's Brad?
-Locked in the car.

55:55.143 --> 55:56.936
Handcuffed to the door.
He's calmed down,

55:56.978 --> 55:59.522
but he is a ticking bomb.
We gotta do something

55:59.564 --> 56:01.983
-before he goes to the cops.
-[door opens]

56:02.025 --> 56:05.403
[doctor] Okay, so all
of Mr. Gallagher's behavior

56:05.445 --> 56:07.364
can be explained by
his previous diagnosis.

56:07.405 --> 56:09.324
We didn't find evidence
of anything new.

56:09.366 --> 56:10.825
[Lip] Sorry,
his-his previous diagnosis?

56:10.867 --> 56:13.161
Well, we treated Mr. Gallagher
three weeks ago,

56:13.203 --> 56:15.747
did a neurological assessment,
and arrived at a diagnosis

56:15.789 --> 56:18.375
of alcoholic dementia.

56:20.126 --> 56:22.921
I'm...sorry. I thought
he would have told you by now.

56:22.962 --> 56:24.214
I'm sure I mentioned it.

56:24.255 --> 56:27.217
[Ian] No.
You didn't.

56:27.258 --> 56:29.469
I'm sorry.
What is alcoholic dementia?

56:29.511 --> 56:32.180
Basically, he pickled his brain
with decades of drinking,

56:32.222 --> 56:34.099
and now his mind
is calling it quits.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.976
It involves significant
impairments of memory

56:37.018 --> 56:39.354
and other cognitive functions.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.648
Were you aware that your father
is an alcoholic?

56:41.689 --> 56:45.360
[Lip] There's been
some evidence of that, yeah.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.404
Some days will be good,
and some will be bad.

56:47.445 --> 56:48.738
Very bad.

56:48.780 --> 56:51.324
It won't be
a linear progression.

56:51.366 --> 56:53.660
You have to be prepared
to go along for the ride.

56:53.701 --> 56:55.495
And try not to contradict him.

56:55.537 --> 56:58.331
That leads to confusion
and anger.

56:58.373 --> 57:00.166
Excuse me.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.506
What are we doin'
in the hospital?

57:06.548 --> 57:08.174
One of you have another kid?

57:10.009 --> 57:11.970
No, you-you've got dementia.

57:12.011 --> 57:15.056
From bein' a drunk, Frank.

57:16.057 --> 57:17.725
[Frank laughs]

57:23.565 --> 57:26.359
funky music
