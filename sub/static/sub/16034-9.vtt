WEBVTT

00:41.840 --> 00:46.220
How the tide rushes in

00:47.320 --> 00:51.302
And covers footprints in the sand

00:52.120 --> 00:57.581
As my hope's erased and carried

00:57.760 --> 01:00.945
Out of my hands

01:01.760 --> 01:10.225
Yet though the ocean with waves unending

01:11.240 --> 01:20.148
Covers the earth,
yet is there loss after all?

01:22.160 --> 01:23.263
(Door opens)

01:23.440 --> 01:26.307
We've had visitors, Cap'n.
From Wheal Radiant.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.345
Do we wish to sell our headgear?

01:30.560 --> 01:32.539
They didn't waste much time.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.620
- How much have they offered?
- A fair price.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.779
They're decent men.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.465
They know it could happen
to the best of us.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.504
The best of us would have bought timbers.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.379
The men knew the risks.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.302
Did their wives...

01:55.920 --> 01:57.899
..their children?

01:58.920 --> 02:00.581
'Tis the business, Ross.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.819
But no longer, it seems.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.059
- Was that from the mine?
- What?

02:12.240 --> 02:13.468
Your eye.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.139
Oh... No.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.826
My wife took exception to something I said.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.422
(Laughs)

02:26.720 --> 02:30.861
Oh, whate'er drifts from one place

02:31.040 --> 02:35.420
Is with the tide to another port

02:35.600 --> 02:41.744
And there's nought lost beyond recall

02:45.240 --> 02:52.499
Which cannot be found if sought

02:53.840 --> 02:54.989
(Knock on door)

02:57.600 --> 02:59.306
'Ee be coming down to breakfast?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.868
Thank you, Prudie.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.100
Master Jeremy and I will be taking
our breakfast here from now on.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.262
Nay, but the chores is piling up downstairs.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.828
You're mistook, Prudie.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.507
Master Jeremy and I are gentlefolks, after all.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.859
(Jeremy gurgles happily)

03:34.320 --> 03:36.299
This is well met.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.779
I was just debating whether to write
and offer my commiserations.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.619
- On what?
- Your recent loss.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.459
Or should I say, losses?

03:47.280 --> 03:50.829
And perhaps you've not heard...
Elizabeth and I are engaged.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.301
So, in the grand scheme ofthings,
you appear to be in disarray.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.346
And I appear to have won.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.064
As you say, George,
you appear to have won.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.019
(Horse whinnies)

04:50.720 --> 04:53.666
- When do you expect him?
- Who?

04:55.640 --> 04:58.780
My nephew is not always
the most subtle of men.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.899
Nor the most discreet.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.099
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- Oh, don't be coy, Elizabeth!

05:06.280 --> 05:09.067
There's no one here but ourselves.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.547
You will know that I have never married.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.219
Perhaps you think that was an accident?

05:17.840 --> 05:21.742
- Well, I...
- Perhaps I think so too sometimes.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.985
Then I remind myself I've yet to meet the man
who could better me.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.468
It is the better man we long for, is it not?

05:35.720 --> 05:38.382
Sometimes it's not the most convenient man.

05:41.480 --> 05:47.862
But come, let us not pretend we prefer
a Warleggan under this roofto a Poldark!

05:51.600 --> 05:53.625
Of course I'm sorry for his kitchen maid.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.745
But we have much to thank her for.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.186
But one must acknowledge the prior claim.

06:01.960 --> 06:07.944
So we can assume he will _return _to this house
as soon as he's put his own In order.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.864
Churn, I? I ain't churned since...

06:27.040 --> 06:30.669
Since the maid first come. Showed 'ee what
a dog's gizzards 'ee ever made of it.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.469
Smirk all 'ee like. She'll give 'ee no aid now
with the calves or seeding.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.743
'T'ain't right.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.025
- Where's your mistress?
- Her bed.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.826
- Is she unwell?
- Must be.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.300
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.141
I can't decide.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.981
Hence the enquiry.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.264
It's been so long since the mistress let me bake,

06:57.440 --> 06:59.260
I've mislaid all my skillage.

06:59.440 --> 07:00.702
It would appear so.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.907
Perhaps you could mislay this...
and bring me something edible.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.827
Oh, you're still here.

07:24.080 --> 07:28.779
Is Trenwith not yet in readiness?
Would you like for me to help you pack?

07:28.960 --> 07:32.020
I thought you should know that
we're selling the headgear of Grace.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.502
The venturers ofWheal Radiant
have offered a fair price.

07:36.680 --> 07:41.026
Do you suppose that she ever seriously
meant to marry George?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.106
Surely it was just a trick
to get you to declare your hand?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.747
I've no idea what she intended.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.626
Still, it worked, did it not?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.665
She got what she wanted.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.422
Demelza, I never claimed to be perfect.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.579
Have I ever asked for that?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.866
Not as I recall,
but perhaps my memory serves me ill,

08:01.040 --> 08:05.500
for I seem to remember we promised
to forsake all others.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.786
I realise...that I betrayed your trust.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.939
Forfeit.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.341
And that your pride is wounded.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.101
Pnde?

08:16.760 --> 08:18.261
My pride?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.820
To think I did always look up to you...

08:27.320 --> 08:28.867
..respect you,

08:29.040 --> 08:32.589
revere you as my master
long before you were my husband.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.505
I see that, but...

08:35.680 --> 08:37.659
For it did seem to me,

08:38.480 --> 08:40.380
unschooled as I was,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.499
that you were not like other men.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.865
You had a kind of nobility,

08:48.040 --> 08:50.144
not of birth, but of character.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.222
I was so proud to think
that such a man had married me.

08:58.360 --> 09:02.182
So now to discover that you are
so much less than other men,

09:04.120 --> 09:07.021
or fallen so low because so far...

09:10.680 --> 09:13.023
It is not my pride that is wounded, Ross.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.506
It is my pride in you.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.019
(Door shuts)

10:09.160 --> 10:11.663
Sir John Trevaunance. Unwin Trevaunance.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.024
- Lady Whitworth.
- Her son Osbert?

10:14.200 --> 10:15.861
The Honourable Maria Agar.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.179
- Sir Hugh Bodrugan.
- His brother Robert.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.147
William Hick. Mr and Mrs Alfred Barbery.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.027
Ray Penvenen. And his niece, Caroline.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.587
George Warleggan
to marry EliZabeth Poldark!

10:28.240 --> 10:31.220
I could have sworn her interests
lay elsewhere.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.665
But plainly a lady may not always have
what her heart desires.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.740
(Chuckles)

11:34.320 --> 11:36.584
- (Jeremy grunts)
- Jeremy!

11:37.560 --> 11:38.788
Demelza.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.939
We cannot continue like this.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.304
If you could at least see it from my perspective.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.823
Soon you'll be asking me
to see it from Elizabeth's.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.184
- Hardly.
- Course, it's no mystery.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.069
Bet she can't wait to have you installed
in her house. Or in her bed.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.787
Demelza. ..

11:58.960 --> 12:01.667
Indeed I do suspicion
that's exactly what her letter says.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.501
- What letter?
- It came about an hour since.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.389
She's doubtless wondering what's keeping you.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.545
Truly we wonder ourselves, don't we, Jeremy?

12:14.720 --> 12:16.187
Wheee!

12:17.440 --> 12:18.862
May I see it?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.579
It's in the library.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.420
On your pillow.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.819
(Jeremy grizzles)

13:16.960 --> 13:18.985
I may be out late tomorrow night.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.746
I'm going to Truro.
And I'm unsure as to when I'll be back.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.582
Why don't you just say it, Ross?
"I'm going to Elizabeth."

13:28.760 --> 13:30.421
The letter was not from her.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.545
Of course not.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.507
Here. Read it if you wish.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.909
Richard Tonkin has been released
from debtors' prison and wishes to see me,

13:41.080 --> 13:45.619
no doubt to ask if I can assist him the way I did
Harry Blewitt when Carnmore collapsed, but...

13:47.280 --> 13:48.941
..as you know, I have no money to spare.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.619
It's a pity. You'll miss the Bodrugan party.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.539
That's the least of my regrets.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.268
Demelza. ..

14:04.080 --> 14:07.345
..I would never...deliberately hurt you.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.299
- You of all people must know that.
- Must I, Ross?

14:11.480 --> 14:15.223
So I'm to assume that you inflict pain
by accident without a second thought?

14:15.400 --> 14:17.948
In the moment, I admit it,
there was no thought of you.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.699
Or ofthe pain I might have caused.
It was as if I was possessed.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.701
Of course! No fault of yours.
Just a greater power,

14:25.880 --> 14:28.986
- and you and her helpless to resist!
- In a way, yes.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.908
Perhaps I might have hoped for some...
understanding, knowing you as I do.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.868
Knowing me to be kind
and simple and giving?

14:39.040 --> 14:41.179
Would you like me to throw myself
off Hendrawna cliff

14:41.360 --> 14:45.103
so that you might bury me at your own
convenience and wed again at your leisure?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.147
I don't blame you for your anger,
but how does it serve us now?

14:49.040 --> 14:50.143
Serve us?

14:51.120 --> 14:52.940
How did you serve us?

14:53.120 --> 14:56.100
How does this...serve us?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.179
Clear this away.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.821
GEORGE: Lavish, ofcourse.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.661
No expense spared.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.899
After all, how often does a man get married?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.265
From the lady herself?

15:25.440 --> 15:28.500
No doubt anxious about some detail
oftrImmIng or confectionery.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.659
Will you excuse me?

15:36.160 --> 15:37.741
ELIZABETH:
My dear George.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.309
I am writing to request the smallest offavours:

15:41.280 --> 15:43.100
a postponement of our wedding.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.662
My dear. I cannot make head nor tail
ofyour letter.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.262
What can you mean by it?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.307
George, I beg you.
Try to understand my position.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.540
These past few days,
it has dawned on me how rash I've been.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.588
Plunging into this marriage, such haste.
It does not look seemly.

16:33.920 --> 16:37.344
And you tell me this a week before the wedding
when all the guests are invited?

16:38.720 --> 16:42.019
But did we not agree that this would be
an entirely private wedding?

16:42.200 --> 16:45.579
A few of my closest friends
would be hurt to be excluded.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.024
George, I have promised to marry you

16:48.200 --> 16:51.465
and look forward to beginning
our life together at Cardew.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.189
But I feel it would not _be fair to either of us
to marry In haste.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.506
Is this anything to do with Ross?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.027
Why would you think so?

17:03.200 --> 17:04.542
Is it?

17:04.720 --> 17:08.622
No. That is, obviously he does not favour
the arrangement.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.462
- Has he been here?
- He called.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.744
And he is behind this change of heart!
I knew it!

17:13.920 --> 17:16.582
No! It is my own delicacy.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.269
Seeing him reminded me
how soon it is since Francis died.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.500
I beg you not to be angry with me.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.903
I...want to be indulgent...

17:30.920 --> 17:33.024
..both before and after our wedding.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.145
It's a bitter disappointment to me.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.662
But I will try to agree to your wishes
ifyou will promise me one thing.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.344
- Yes?
- That you name another date today.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.707
Oh...

17:45.880 --> 17:47.780
No... I cannot.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.303
Come, my dear, let us compromise,

17:50.480 --> 17:53.381
so that both of us may get something
from the arrangement.

17:53.560 --> 17:58.907
Grant me the consolation of being able
to fix a date - a month from today.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.705
- So soon?
- What is there to wait for?

18:03.880 --> 18:06.064
What do you imagine will happen
in the meantime?

18:09.600 --> 18:11.067
I do not know.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.660
Can I rely on you, Elizabeth?

18:27.920 --> 18:29.706
Very well...

18:29.880 --> 18:31.859
a month from today.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.140
- You would not!
- I would, EliZabeth. And so would you.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.579
DEMELZA: Give mybest to Elizabeth.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.303
Was it not clear? I'm not going to Trenwith.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.187
No, Ross. To Truro, that's right.
I remember.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.821
Servant come from Werry House.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.822
Sir Hugh begs to know
if you will attend the party.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.579
Oh, Judas, I forgot to reply to his invitation.

19:45.760 --> 19:50.868
Erm...tell the servant we sincerely regret that
Captain Poldark has been called away.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.101
Although...

19:55.480 --> 19:57.903
..Mistress Demelza
would be delighted to attend.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.665
(Carriage approaches)

20:10.840 --> 20:12.068
Finally.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.948
- Compose yourself, Elizabeth.
- (Clears throat)

20:16.120 --> 20:19.305
What shall I say? How should I proceed?

20:19.480 --> 20:22.347
With resolve, girl!

20:22.520 --> 20:25.387
'Tis no easy thing you contemplate.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.748
'Tis for you to dictate the terms!

20:29.760 --> 20:32.581
- You have more to lose.
- (Footsteps approaching)

20:38.960 --> 20:42.384
Oh, my dear. I had to come.
When I heard you postponed the wedding,

20:42.560 --> 20:44.061
I knew at once what was behind it.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.429
Oh, my goodness! Elizabeth!

20:49.600 --> 20:51.784
Elizabeth! Oh, whatever's the matter?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.666
Oh, Elizabeth!

21:00.800 --> 21:01.903
Ross.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.947
I don't recall seeing that black eye.
Was it from the rock fall?

21:05.120 --> 21:07.179
Must have been. Where are you headed?

21:07.360 --> 21:09.180
I've been summoned to Trenwith,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.783
I imagine to treat Mrs Chenoweth.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.508
How's Demelza bearing up?

21:14.680 --> 21:16.261
After the disaster?

21:16.920 --> 21:20.549
She was a godsend that day.
I know I'm preaching to the converted, but...

21:21.280 --> 21:23.066
You've married a remarkable woman.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.579
Indeed.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.705
- And where are you bound?
- Truro.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.268
To Meet Richard Tonkin.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.068
Though I fear he wants to tap me for a loan.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.787
Shall we meet later? Take supper?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.666
Or would you prefer to dine with Demelza?

21:36.840 --> 21:38.705
Let's sup together.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.698
I know what 'ee be thinking.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.859
"What's good for the gander..."

22:03.520 --> 22:06.500
I don't blame 'ee, maid,
but no good'll come of it.

22:15.040 --> 22:19.625
It's no cause for alarm.
Mrs Poldark has a fragile disposition.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.540
Doubtless she's been under some strain.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.587
Did she say she's postponed her wedding
to George Warleggan?

22:25.600 --> 22:27.659
- Indefinitely?
- For a month.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.739
Give her these powders.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.184
- I'll call again tomorrow.
- Thank you.

22:49.360 --> 22:52.181
(Cries oftraders)

23:05.280 --> 23:07.544
- Tonkin.
- Ha! Captain.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.340
- Good to see you at liberty, sir.
- I'll not forget your kindness.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.182
When hard times come,
many friends fall away. You did not.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.348
But your own affairs...

23:17.440 --> 23:19.863
- Do not prosper.
- So I hear.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.508
You'll be wondering why I asked to see you.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.019
(Low chatter)

23:33.360 --> 23:36.739
Ah! Mistress Demelza!

23:36.920 --> 23:42.108
You ventured to trust yourselfto my care,
and lef your husband by the fireside!

23:42.280 --> 23:45.829
Indeed I did, sir.
I decided it was not the weather for firesides.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.900
- Or husbands.
- (Laughs heartily)

23:48.960 --> 23:51.099
Now, where have they put you for the night?

23:51.280 --> 23:52.781
Ah, yes! The red room!

23:52.960 --> 23:56.669
Two years ago, you advanced Harry Blewitt
the sum of250.

23:56.840 --> 24:00.549
And believe me,
I regret I was unable to do the same for you.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.699
It saved him from debtors' prison.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.782
He was able to rearrange his finances
and start a small boatbuilding venture.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.269
He's had his fill of mining. I don't blame him.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.661
When I left prison, he invited me
to become his partner in the business.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.741
Our venture at present is small,
but we have high hopes.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.627
Of course, ifwe had more capital,
progress would be swifer...

24:19.800 --> 24:22.382
I must stop you there.
If you're looking for investment,

24:22.560 --> 24:23.948
you've come to the wrong man.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.939
(Laughs)

24:28.360 --> 24:31.102
Investment? Dear me, no, sir.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.259
That isn't it at all.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.909
- It's good of you to invite me, Sir Hugh.
- I don't know why I do!

25:30.960 --> 25:32.905
You've tripled your income in six months!

25:33.080 --> 25:35.025
'Twas a moderate investment when we set out.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.020
But with the war...

25:38.080 --> 25:39.786
..demand has gone sky high and now...

25:39.960 --> 25:41.985
You've the makings of a first-rate business.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.262
And you too, sir. If you choose.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.539
(Jaunty folk tune on the fiddle)

25:52.560 --> 25:54.539
(Laughter and chatter)

26:05.600 --> 26:07.147
(Chatter dies down)

26:16.120 --> 26:18.099
Mistress Demelza!

26:19.440 --> 26:22.785
What a sight for sore eyes!

26:23.440 --> 26:25.579
Perhaps you'll introduce me to your friends?

26:25.760 --> 26:27.739
Oh, by all means.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.386
- Surely you jest?
- On the contrary.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.625
She was a scullery maid!

26:35.800 --> 26:38.268
Then you should find her
all the more eager to serve.

26:39.240 --> 26:41.902
Oh, come, man,
I'm in sore need of entertainment.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.947
So you wish me to heap further ignominy
on Poldark?

26:45.120 --> 26:48.226
By debauching his wife. Precisely.
Come, I'll introduce you.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.182
Mistress Demelza.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.741
Is Ross not here?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.626
He's been called away on business.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.028
Where is Elizabeth?

27:03.200 --> 27:06.704
- She has family matters to attend to.
- Hm, I can imagine.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.386
May I introduce Mr Tankard?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.541
Your servant, ma'am.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.419
He's a little shy and barely knows a soul.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.148
- Perhaps you'll take pity on him.
- Oh, perhaps I will.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.904
- Do you dance, sir?
- I could be persuaded.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.503
Mistress Demelza,
know our friend Margaret Vosper?

27:26.680 --> 27:28.102
Mistress Ross Poldark.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.588
Ma'am.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.263
I believe you two ladies
have something in common.

27:32.440 --> 27:35.898
- I believe we do.
- And what would that be?

27:36.080 --> 27:39.220
Both devilish pretty women
who've only got to crook their finger,

27:39.400 --> 27:42.062
the men come running!

27:42.240 --> 27:45.027
I had no idea there were so many
handsome men in Cornwall!

27:45.200 --> 27:48.499
It's fortunate for you that
you need not fear the competition.

27:48.680 --> 27:49.749
(Sir Hugh laughs)

27:49.920 --> 27:52.468
I buried several husbands
and serwced countless more.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.108
I never see the point in beating about the bush.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.068
Myself, I prefer to take time
making up my mind.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.868
Even if it do seem like beating about the bush.

28:04.040 --> 28:08.306
I'd sooner do that than get scratched
or worn on every bush I see.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.099
And does your husband share your delicacy?

28:18.960 --> 28:21.099
- Shall we dance, sir?
- Mistress Poldark.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.299
Oh, Captain McNeil.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.424
What a happy coincidence.
May I escort you to supper?

28:29.080 --> 28:31.219
Now you mention it,
I do have something of an appetite.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.868
And I'm a great believer
in indulging such a thing.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.581
Pray excuse me, sir.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.739
You may reclaim me presently.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.220
My dear, I would speak with you.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.584
Oh, I... I do not feel strong enough...

28:56.760 --> 28:58.739
Elizabeth, don't be afraid.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.309
I understand your feelings.
They're quite natural,

29:01.480 --> 29:03.459
after all that has happened.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.906
What...can you mean?

29:06.080 --> 29:08.298
I sympathise more than you think.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.261
You wonder
how you can give your hand to George,

29:12.440 --> 29:14.658
when your heart is committed elsewhere?

29:17.360 --> 29:18.941
Yes.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.541
But...more than that...

29:22.720 --> 29:24.824
There can be no more than that, my dear.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.627
You must let him go. He would want you to.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.462
- I do not think so.
- But I know that he would.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.305
And who can say better than I?

29:35.360 --> 29:39.865
_ As his sister...
he IS dearer to me than almost anyone.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.463
I know he and George
were enemies at the end,

29:42.640 --> 29:45.029
but Francis would want you to be happy.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.859
And if George is your choice...

29:48.800 --> 29:51.303
..I believe you would have his blessing.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.982
And yours?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.900
And mine.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.383
Here.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.979
(Laughs)

30:13.000 --> 30:14.183
(Demelza gasps)

30:17.200 --> 30:19.304
(Both laughing)

30:22.760 --> 30:24.227
(Cheering)

30:24.920 --> 30:27.980
My dear life! I'm so hot, I could faint.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.140
- 'Tis fortunate you have someone to catch you.
- (Laughs)

30:33.200 --> 30:35.942
And now...I have some sad news.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.944
Tomorrow I leave to rejoin my regiment.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.940
Oh, I think I shall weep.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.543
So, I wondered, as a special favour tonight...

30:44.320 --> 30:46.220
would you consider...

30:47.160 --> 30:48.787
..calling me Malcolm?

30:50.680 --> 30:53.945
And, in return,
you'll be wishing to call me Demelza?

30:54.800 --> 30:56.461
'Tis a very pretty name.

30:56.640 --> 30:58.505
What does it mean?

30:58.680 --> 31:02.138
Well, my mother once told me that,
in the old Cornish tongue,

31:02.320 --> 31:04.265
it means "thy sweetness".

31:05.080 --> 31:07.787
I would rather it meant "my sweetness".

31:13.760 --> 31:15.261
It's very close in here.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.868
Shall we take a breath of air in the garden?

31:25.400 --> 31:27.664
(Low conversation)

31:32.600 --> 31:33.749
(Knock at door)

31:34.800 --> 31:36.700
Well? Did he fleece you like a footpad?

31:36.880 --> 31:40.020
No. He showered me with blessings.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.103
The debt repaid in full...

31:43.280 --> 31:45.339
or a share in a profitable business.

31:45.520 --> 31:48.102
That's excellent. What will you do?

31:49.240 --> 31:52.698
Iftruth be told, I'm half-tempted
to follow your lead and enlist.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.542
What, now, when things are looking up?

31:55.720 --> 31:57.540
Surely, you've too much to keep you here?

31:57.720 --> 32:00.109
Yes. You would think so.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.903
But...?

32:06.880 --> 32:09.462
When are our choices ever straightforward?

32:20.680 --> 32:23.626
Are you cold? May I fetch your wrap?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.665
I have none.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.740
I'm glad of it.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.899
I know a better way to warm you.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.384
You're most attentive, Malcolm.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.179
Surely, you cannot be short of attention?

32:40.360 --> 32:43.102
Everywhere I look, men are snarling over you.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.419
I fancy they do not suit you as well as...

32:48.400 --> 32:49.867
As well as...?

33:05.760 --> 33:08.103
Ever since I met you, I've wanted to do that.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.739
I hope you are not disappointed.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.467
On the contrary.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.140
You've given me an appetite for more.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.300
We should return to the party.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.986
Can you not give me a word
of encouragement before we go?

33:28.720 --> 33:30.984
Surely, you've had enough already?

33:31.640 --> 33:34.222
But will you not give me something to hope for?

33:34.920 --> 33:36.899
Later tonight?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.740
Which is your room?

33:52.040 --> 33:54.702
I'm not well acquainted with this house, but...

33:56.000 --> 33:58.389
..I think Sir Hugh called it the Red Room.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.421
I know it.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.787
Thank you, my sweetness.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.186
Thank you.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.743
- You seem distracted.
- Do I?

34:30.920 --> 34:33.059
- Despite your good fortune.
- (Chuckles)

34:34.200 --> 34:37.180
- Is all well at home?
- Yes.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.860
Well, no.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.622
Demelza and I... (Sighs)

34:43.480 --> 34:47.268
Let us just say that attachments
are complicated, as you well know.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.506
Your cousin-in-law may agree.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.543
Elizabeth?

34:55.320 --> 34:57.345
It was she I was called to attend at Trenwith.

34:57.520 --> 35:01.342
A fainting fit. She's postponed her wedding.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.229
She has?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.022
Are you certain?

35:06.200 --> 35:10.580
Clearly, the thought of marrying George
Warleggan was more than she could stand.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.148
Did anyone see you?

36:07.200 --> 36:10.385
I hope I know how to conduct an ambush,
my darling.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.618
- So...you leave tomorrow?
- At noon.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.865
And I shall not see you again.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.826
You shall, if you wish.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.026
You may write to me, at Winchester.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.828
- Malcolm...
- My angel?

36:41.720 --> 36:43.824
- Are you kind?
- Immensely.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.379
Then I beg you to bear with me, to understand

36:47.560 --> 36:50.779
why I led you to believe that...

36:53.360 --> 36:56.306
- It is on account of my husband.
- Don't think of him.

36:56.480 --> 37:00.064
- He has betrayed me with another.
- Is he insane?

37:00.240 --> 37:03.585
- So I thought that I should do the same.
- Most assuredly.

37:03.760 --> 37:07.184
- Please, please, just hear me out.
- Have I told you how beautiful you are?

37:07.360 --> 37:10.579
I begin to realise something about myself.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.344
Call it weakness, if you will,
but I cannot give myselfto any man...

37:14.520 --> 37:17.865
- You can.
- ..except my husband.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.827
I am bound to him. I wish it were not the case...

37:21.000 --> 37:22.786
My angel...

37:24.240 --> 37:26.549
It does you credit to be so delicate.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.859
But think for a moment of me...

37:31.600 --> 37:34.660
who's been looking forward
to this...encounter...

37:35.720 --> 37:38.029
..as a mortal's taste of heaven.

37:38.200 --> 37:41.340
Your duty now is not to your husband...

37:42.480 --> 37:44.459
..but to me.

37:46.480 --> 37:48.869
(Grunts) Malcolm, please...

37:49.840 --> 37:52.866
(Gasps) Malcolm, stop.

37:54.360 --> 37:55.861
Stop! Malcolm!

37:58.200 --> 37:59.781
Stop!

38:09.320 --> 38:11.948
I like a woman who knows her own mind.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.099
I thought you were such a one.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.021
My mistake.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.542
(Door opens and closes)

38:31.840 --> 38:33.819
(Breathes raggedly)

38:36.200 --> 38:38.179
Ross, I hate you.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.465
I hate you.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.101
Ross! What brings you here?

38:57.280 --> 38:59.180
A disinclination to go home early.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.784
Well, join us, then, as we drown our sorrows,

39:02.960 --> 39:04.985
eke out the last of our earnings.

39:05.160 --> 39:08.709
- Don't remind me. _
- Oh, nay, Ross, don't take It hard.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.467
All of us were willing to work without timbers.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.183
And if it were to do again,
we'd none of us think twice.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.305
You cannot mean that,

39:18.480 --> 39:20.141
after we lost Ted.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.143
Rislq work's better than none.

39:24.320 --> 39:28.427
Grace put food on our table.
More than that. She gave us hope.

39:29.960 --> 39:33.782
I'll tell 'ee: were it not that the lode's buried
'neath 30 fathom of rock,

39:33.960 --> 39:35.746
we'd be back down there like a shot.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.586
- You would?
- With Ted's blessing.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.660
- Damn, blast and set fire to it!
- What the blazes...?

39:57.840 --> 40:02.140
SIR HUGH: I believe you're lost, sir.
Your room is on the east side.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.665
Thank you, sir. I know where my room is,
and to whom this one belongs.

40:05.840 --> 40:09.389
_ _ - But...no... _ _
- Damn It, Slr, she as good as InVIted me.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.539
Now, just scuttle off and turn a blind eye.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.462
Blind eye? I was going in there, myself.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.346
Don't tell me she invited you!

40:16.520 --> 40:20.069
SIR HUGH: Blast it, sir. You had no invitation.
You thought you'd try your luck.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.299
TANKARD: Blast yourself, sir. I was here first.

40:22.480 --> 40:25.267
I'm the host. It's only right that I have first pick.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.988
A host should yield to a guest.
It is the proper etiquette.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.822
Etiquette be damned!
If you go in there, I go with you.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.499
I don't fancy we'll win her that way.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.667
Suppose we toss a coin?

40:40.160 --> 40:42.105
No one shall say I'm not a sportsman.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.908
- Call.
- Heads.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.463
Tails. Stand aside, sir.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.903
What the devil...?

41:04.480 --> 41:07.142
Well, I've never known a woman
promise so much

41:07.320 --> 41:09.299
and deliver so little.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.183
(Sighs)

42:37.120 --> 42:39.099
- Where's Demelza?
- Out.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.787
- Since when?
- Since she went to Bodrugan's party.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.387
Did she say she would stay the night?

42:46.560 --> 42:48.619
- Did she?
- I don't recall.

42:50.280 --> 42:51.622
So, you've no idea where she is?

42:51.800 --> 42:54.303
I reckon she's as much right
as any to stay out all night.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.902
Which she do.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.347
Demelza!

44:07.400 --> 44:10.346
Ross. Kind of you to come and meet me.

44:11.560 --> 44:13.380
Did you have a pleasant time at Trenwith?

44:13.560 --> 44:16.745
I told you:
I went to Truro to meet Richard Tonkin.

44:16.920 --> 44:21.539
Whatever you say, Ross. Do what you will.
Go and live with her, if you wish.

44:25.560 --> 44:28.142
It's quite possible
her marriage will still go ahead.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.504
No doubt you did your best to prevent it.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.907
No doubt I did.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.898
So, does she love George, then?

44:36.080 --> 44:37.866
No, she does not.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.385
Demelza, I cannot blame you for your anger...

44:42.200 --> 44:45.101
..but if you could bide a while,
have a little patience...

44:45.280 --> 44:49.341
_ _ _ - Patience?
- ..thIs thIng WIll play Itself out, sooner or later.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.829
I see. So, you expect me
to sit and twiddle my thumbs

44:52.000 --> 44:54.025
until you decide whether or not you want me?

44:54.200 --> 44:56.145
It's not a question ofwanting you.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.459
It's a question of not wanting her.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.386
- Do you not want her?
- No.

45:04.760 --> 45:06.546
I don't know.

45:07.840 --> 45:10.980
- Sometimes...
- I'm not content to be second-best.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.981
- Have I asked you to be?
- Have you not made me so?

45:14.800 --> 45:16.904
Why am I here, Demelza?

45:17.080 --> 45:19.503
Why do you suppose I'm still here?

45:19.680 --> 45:21.545
I don't know why you're still here, Ross.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.380
Because Elizabeth can't make up her mind?

45:24.560 --> 45:25.788
No.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.499
Because Elizabeth does not want you?

45:30.160 --> 45:32.583
Because she knows George is the better bet?

45:37.240 --> 45:39.982
I came here with good news!

45:40.160 --> 45:43.869
I came here to tell you
that Blewitt can repay the money I lent him.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.905
We can reopen Grace!

45:50.440 --> 45:52.419
Demelza. ..

46:05.600 --> 46:07.181
(Sighs)

46:09.680 --> 46:11.819
You must take the decision alone.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.221
Aunt?

46:14.400 --> 46:17.267
You cannot wait for him to help you.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.585
I don't understand.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.580
How can he treat me so?

46:22.760 --> 46:25.547
How can he leave things so...up in the air?

46:25.720 --> 46:27.062
And not for the first time.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.741
Exactly.

46:28.920 --> 46:32.265
Once before, I waited for him
to come and see me, and when he did not...

46:32.440 --> 46:34.544
You married Francis.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.899
- And now...?
- I do not know.

46:39.720 --> 46:41.938
He's deserted me.

46:42.120 --> 46:43.940
He tried to stop this marriage,

46:44.120 --> 46:46.099
but offered nothing in return.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.868
He has taken what was not rightly his

46:50.040 --> 46:52.144
and walked away from the consequences.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.859
Why did he have to come?

46:55.920 --> 46:57.899
I hate him for it.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.628
He's left me with only one possible choice.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.739
(Church bells ringing)

47:39.720 --> 47:41.938
I reckon it'll take two weeks to clear the rubble.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.985
And we'll have her up and running again.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.339
What are we waiting for?

47:50.240 --> 47:53.380
I see Ross be not at his cousin's wedding.

48:03.920 --> 48:06.468
Such a pity
that relations with George are so strained

48:06.640 --> 48:08.346
that Ross could not attend the wedding.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.499
If you say so.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.259
Come and sit with me, child.

48:19.240 --> 48:22.824
So, now you're all that remain
ofthe Trenwith Poldarks.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.662
No doubt Warleggan would dispense with us,
if he could.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.660
Oh, you'll hardly see him, Aunt.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.866
Once they're living at Cardew,
why would he even visit?

48:31.880 --> 48:33.507
Elizabeth may come to see her mother,

48:33.680 --> 48:37.548
but, to all intents and purposes,
you are mistress now.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.620
You will visit me often?

48:41.520 --> 48:42.748
Like old times.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.821
Ifwe close our eyes,
it will seem like 20 years ago...

48:47.840 --> 48:50.183
..with Francis and Father still alive,

48:50.360 --> 48:52.180
and Ross riding over every day.

48:52.360 --> 48:53.941
Ross?

48:54.800 --> 48:56.381
Yes.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.142
How different might it all have been.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.659
He must wonder why I sleep here now.

50:08.160 --> 50:12.426
- Perhaps you should tell him.
- That you don't wish to have me near you?

50:12.600 --> 50:16.661
Or that you now find me distasteful,
after the delicate charms of Elizabeth.

50:31.400 --> 50:33.265
(Bell chiming)

50:38.480 --> 50:40.903
ROSS: You'd never think
you almost lost your lives down there.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.139
Well, we've all got to go sometime.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.388
I wish Ted could have lived to see the day.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.869
- You did all you could.
- It wasn't enough.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.703
I wonder ifthe Navy's so desperate
as to need a second-rate surgeon.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.667
The Navy will need all the men it can get,
ifthe war continues.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.741
An auspicious day.
Mistress Poldark should be here.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.548
She's always taken an interest
in our ventures before.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.699
Demelza has business elsewhere.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.827
- You were born for this life, my dear.
- I like to think so.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.299
London is full of beauties,
but you will outshine them all.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.780
Such a privilege
to have Lord and Lady Warleggan to tea.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.304
Oh, have I ennobled you prematurely?

51:55.480 --> 51:58.108
I'm sure the honour will soon be forthcoming.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.146
And how is Cornwall?
Do you see much of Dr Enys?

52:03.840 --> 52:05.307
He attends my mother.

52:05.960 --> 52:08.667
So, he's finally moving in more exalted circles.

52:08.840 --> 52:12.549
I fear not, ma'am. I think
my mother is his only fee-paying patient.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.660
But how secretive you've been.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.343
You announced your wedding so late,
Uncle and I could not attend.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.947
Erm...my wife kept me waiting a while,

52:22.120 --> 52:24.259
until she gave her answer.

52:24.440 --> 52:25.748
Quite right.

52:25.920 --> 52:28.024
Marriage lasts a lifetime.

52:28.200 --> 52:31.067
A lady must be sure
she's making the right choice.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.303
Hm.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.178
Ross! Ross!

52:41.960 --> 52:44.019
Cap'n Henshawe be calling for 'ee.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.109
Can it wait?

52:46.280 --> 52:48.862
There's something he needs 'ee to see.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.379
(Clatter of shovels in distance)

53:13.560 --> 53:16.063
GEORGE: I've been thinking about
our domestic arrangements.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.629
You'll be glad to return home to Cardew.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.261
I had thought so, but...

53:22.120 --> 53:26.068
now I believe I've a fancy
to live somewhere else.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.860
- I can scarce believe it.
- Nor I.

53:34.040 --> 53:36.827
When first I saw it,
I thought my eyes deceived me.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.303
- What does it mean?
- It means...

53:40.480 --> 53:43.586
I'm breaking the habit of a lifetime
and taking a drink.

53:46.600 --> 53:49.262
- (Coughs)
- (Laughs)

53:50.480 --> 53:51.708
(Laughs)

54:08.280 --> 54:09.941
I've something to tell you.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.862
We've reached the tin lode that was buried.

54:16.040 --> 54:19.100
We've been working on it for some days,
and today the lode split.

54:19.280 --> 54:23.148
One half is twice the size ofthe old lode.

54:23.920 --> 54:27.026
(Chuckles) Henshawe says
he's never seen richer ground.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.821
Demelza. ..

54:34.360 --> 54:36.339
Do you understand what this means?

54:38.040 --> 54:41.180
I'll be able to pay back the interest on the loan.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.508
More than that.

54:44.440 --> 54:48.501
_ Soon". _
we'll be In a pOSItIon to repay In full.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.659
I'm very glad for you, Ross.

54:51.960 --> 54:53.985
For us.

54:54.680 --> 54:56.864
Do you not see how this changes things?

54:57.040 --> 55:00.862
It will mean notjust survival,
not even a good living...

55:02.000 --> 55:03.820
..but wealth.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.349
After so long,

55:08.520 --> 55:10.499
the very thing we hoped for.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.179
And now it's here.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.259
Has it come too late?

55:26.920 --> 55:28.501
Demelza?
