01:11.000 --> 01:14.503
Hey, Stifler, how come Steve
got all the talent in your family?

01:14.670 --> 01:18.173
- Bite me, Fuck Face.
- Come on, man, you're missing it.

01:18.382 --> 01:21.635
I've seen it a million times,
you fucking ass-booger.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.598
- Steve is like a filmmaking genius.
- A true American hero.

01:25.681 --> 01:27.224
The Tarantino of titties.

01:27.308 --> 01:29.685
Yeah, there's just no way
you could ever be this good.

01:29.768 --> 01:31.312
Hey, look, I'm going to prove to Steve...

01:31.395 --> 01:34.565
that I'm up to the standards
of the Stiffmeister Productions.

01:35.107 --> 01:37.318
After Steve sees my directing talent...

01:37.401 --> 01:40.821
- little bro's joining the family business.
- Is that what he said?

01:40.946 --> 01:45.075
- He finally called you back?
- No, but I left him another message.

01:46.744 --> 01:49.997
He'll get back to me.
It's only been three weeks.

01:51.248 --> 01:56.462
Gentle-fucks, a toast.
Tomorrow, we begin our reign as seniors.

02:58.399 --> 03:00.776
Okay, people, let's take a break.

03:01.151 --> 03:05.447
Remember, we play this at the end of
the ceremony after Pomp and Circumstance.

03:05.573 --> 03:07.783
I don't want anyone starting
the wrong song again.

03:07.908 --> 03:10.828
- Elyse, you need to relax, girl.
- I'm fine.

03:11.203 --> 03:14.123
I just... You know,
it's my first time up here, and...

03:14.206 --> 03:16.917
Yeah, but it's graduation.
It ain't the Boston Pops.

03:17.001 --> 03:20.170
This performance sets the tone
for our senior year. I mean...

03:20.296 --> 03:25.009
Look, you just remember
that everybody here is pulling for you.

03:29.054 --> 03:31.682
Dork. Dork. Dork. Goose.

03:32.641 --> 03:36.228
- I like them feisty.
- What're you doing here, Stifler?

03:36.353 --> 03:38.981
We just want to say sayonara,
and let you fuck-necks know...

03:39.064 --> 03:43.944
we plan on winning the state title, now that
the Stiffmeister's running the show.

03:44.069 --> 03:48.073
- Adios, butt-hugger.
- He's a bigger asshole than his brother.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.454
Holy shit, Arrianna.

03:54.371 --> 03:56.582
Matt, what're you doing here?

03:56.749 --> 04:00.961
Oh, we just want to make sure
the seniors have a very memorable last day.

04:01.086 --> 04:04.048
That's cool. So, there's a campout tonight...

04:04.131 --> 04:07.217
and it's only for the grads,
but you could come.

04:07.301 --> 04:09.970
Let me check my schedule. Hell, yeah.

04:11.263 --> 04:15.100
Bring your sleeping bag,
in case we decide to pitch a tent.

04:20.022 --> 04:23.943
- Check it out. Perfect timing.
- This is going to be classic.

04:24.526 --> 04:27.863
Time to initiate
Operation Gradu-fuck-uation.

04:30.616 --> 04:32.493
This is gonna be awesome.

04:32.618 --> 04:34.411
- Shit.
- Oh, yeah! Jackpot!

04:34.787 --> 04:38.624
Payback, seniors.
Don't get that pepper spray on your hands.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.630
A graduation gift from the Stiffmeister.

04:48.175 --> 04:50.719
Dude, we should've sprayed
the diplomas.

04:53.055 --> 04:54.598
Sorry, bandees.

04:59.770 --> 05:03.524
Bite my nuts and call me Skippy.
It's a Steely Dan.

05:03.774 --> 05:07.027
- A what?
- It's a double-headed dildo.

05:07.736 --> 05:09.196
It's a dildo. It's a dildo.

05:09.863 --> 05:12.074
- Holy shit.
- It's even got a name.

05:13.826 --> 05:14.827
Picardo?

05:15.244 --> 05:18.330
- Spray that shit.
- Fuck, no. Finders keepers.

05:18.622 --> 05:22.042
Okay, everybody, Pomp and
Circumstance. Five-minute warning. Let's go.

05:22.126 --> 05:24.420
The bandees. Let's get out of here.

05:28.591 --> 05:30.634
- Matt?
- Leesy.

05:32.177 --> 05:35.139
How they hanging?
Still small and perky, I see.

05:35.222 --> 05:37.600
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

05:38.684 --> 05:42.688
- What're you doing here, Matt?
- I just came by to wish you good luck.

05:42.771 --> 05:45.316
- You know, on the whole music thing.
- Good luck?

05:45.399 --> 05:48.152
You haven't said a word to me
since the eighth grade.

05:48.277 --> 05:51.280
Yeah, and that tone of voice
is exactly the reason why.

05:51.405 --> 05:53.782
So, I'm going to take off now.

05:57.703 --> 06:01.999
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise to honor our graduates.

06:02.124 --> 06:03.751
Douchebag's gonna miss it.

06:16.555 --> 06:17.890
Oh, yes.

06:21.226 --> 06:22.853
Are they crying?

06:25.606 --> 06:27.024
Holy shit!

06:33.781 --> 06:34.949
Yes!

06:56.470 --> 06:58.180
Eat shit, seniors.

07:18.367 --> 07:19.368
Uh oh!

07:19.743 --> 07:22.037
Stifler!

07:24.707 --> 07:28.377
I've been waiting for this moment
for a very long time.

07:29.628 --> 07:32.423
And now, the day of reckoning has come.

07:35.676 --> 07:37.219
Hello, Matthew.

07:37.761 --> 07:40.139
Your brother must be very proud.

07:42.808 --> 07:45.019
You've continued his legacy.

07:46.061 --> 07:48.188
Tormenting the innocent...

07:48.856 --> 07:51.942
defiling all that is good and pure.

07:55.362 --> 07:58.073
But now, you're going down.

07:59.158 --> 08:02.328
What're you going to do,
expel me, Shermanator?

08:03.746 --> 08:06.707
I am a sophisticated counseling machine...

08:06.790 --> 08:10.544
sent back in time
to guide young and innocent minds.

08:10.920 --> 08:15.883
My primary directive is to protect
the students of this institution...

08:16.800 --> 08:19.637
and all, indeed all mankind...

08:20.429 --> 08:23.349
from the menace that is another Stifler.

08:23.557 --> 08:26.101
Behavior modification is required.

08:26.477 --> 08:29.313
It's not too late to change your future.

08:32.066 --> 08:35.986
No, expulsion would be too easy.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.493
I know the perfect punishment
to fit your crime.

08:44.995 --> 08:48.082
Since you have so much trouble
with the band...

08:48.290 --> 08:51.001
perhaps you should make friends with them.

08:51.085 --> 08:52.711
No fucking way.

08:54.588 --> 08:59.218
Either you learn to be more considerate
or you will be expelled.

09:00.052 --> 09:01.512
No football.

09:02.513 --> 09:03.681
No parties.

09:03.806 --> 09:05.599
No spring break.

09:06.392 --> 09:08.936
No graduation.

09:09.311 --> 09:10.938
No college.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.731
No coeds.

09:13.607 --> 09:15.025
Comprende?

09:19.738 --> 09:21.782
Pack your bags, Stifler.

09:22.324 --> 09:25.119
- You're going to Band Camp.
- Band Camp!

09:31.834 --> 09:34.128
Bullshit, trash.

09:38.841 --> 09:40.301
All right, Steve! Valley Girls Gone Wild.

09:42.052 --> 09:43.137
Fuck.

10:01.864 --> 10:03.115
Told you Steve'd get back to me.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.617
I mean, it was just a postcard...

10:04.700 --> 10:06.911
but it gave me a great idea.

10:06.994 --> 10:08.078
Look...

10:08.203 --> 10:10.331
Steve's shit-head friend, Jim...

10:10.414 --> 10:12.875
he married
this freaking nympho band-geek, Michelle.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.878
And he said
all they do at Band Camp is screw 24/7.

10:15.961 --> 10:20.090
Matt, buddy, you cannot screw band chicks.
There are standards.

10:21.467 --> 10:24.887
I'm not talking about screwing them,
scrotum-breath.

10:25.012 --> 10:27.556
I'm talking about videotaping them.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.143
People love to see dorks doing
that freaky shit on hidden video.

10:31.268 --> 10:35.105
Bandeez Gone Wild.
Steve's gonna have some competition now...

10:35.272 --> 10:37.816
because little bro's
joining the family business.

10:43.113 --> 10:44.740
Yeah, Spy Chest.

10:45.449 --> 10:46.951
Secret Video.

10:48.786 --> 10:49.787
Hell, yeah.

10:53.499 --> 10:54.833
Color night vision? I'll take it. Shit.

11:03.092 --> 11:04.802
How about tomorrow?
This is going be great.

11:46.885 --> 11:49.847
Welcome to Tall Oaks 2005.

11:51.056 --> 11:53.851
Let's hear it from Lloyd Memorial High.

11:53.934 --> 11:56.312
L- L-O-Y-D!

11:57.104 --> 11:58.647
L- L-O-Y-D!

11:59.898 --> 12:01.609
- Mount St. Marie.
- Mount St. Marie!

12:01.817 --> 12:03.193
Mount St. Marie!

12:03.277 --> 12:04.903
East Great Falls High.

12:05.529 --> 12:06.989
East Great Falls!

12:07.531 --> 12:09.033
East Great Falls!

12:09.909 --> 12:13.162
And five-time defending
Tall Oaks Cup Champion...

12:13.495 --> 12:15.289
Beechwood Academy.

12:15.372 --> 12:18.125
We're Number One! We're Number One!
We're Number One!

12:18.208 --> 12:19.376
Okay, settle down.

12:20.294 --> 12:22.588
Now, as you know, each year...

12:22.671 --> 12:25.674
one senior Tall Oaks composer is awarded...

12:25.799 --> 12:30.262
a full scholarship
to the prestigious Robards Conservatory.

12:30.387 --> 12:32.514
Elyse, this is your year to win.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.809
This year, Dr. Susan Choi,
president of Robards...

12:35.935 --> 12:38.854
will judge the compositions herself.

12:38.938 --> 12:43.400
And let's not forget to welcome
the Tall Oaks Camp Counselors.

12:50.741 --> 12:54.995
If you visit our infirmary, Nurse Sanders
will take care of your every need.

12:57.665 --> 13:02.211
Okay, so let's work hard,
and may the best band win.

13:10.219 --> 13:11.303
You guys ready?

13:30.072 --> 13:31.615
What the fuck?

13:31.949 --> 13:34.410
Are you a rookie? You look lost.

13:34.785 --> 13:38.539
Are you an asshole?
You're hairy, and you smell like shit.

13:40.207 --> 13:43.294
I'll ignore that kind of talk once.

13:44.461 --> 13:46.589
We don't speak that way here.

13:46.714 --> 13:51.176
Rookies are to wear their beanies
at all times. Those are the rules.

13:51.260 --> 13:54.054
And who made you
the mayor of Geek Town?

13:54.888 --> 13:59.018
I'm Brandon Vandecamp,
senior drum major, Beechwood Academy...

13:59.101 --> 14:00.811
and the president of the Tall Oaks Council.

14:00.936 --> 14:04.940
Oh, and who are they, Mr. President?
The First Lady and Vice Pussy?

14:11.071 --> 14:12.448
Suits you well.

14:12.573 --> 14:17.286
Golly, jeepers, thanks. Hey, you know,
since I'm an official band geek and all...

14:17.411 --> 14:19.622
can you guess
what my favorite piece of music is?

14:19.747 --> 14:22.207
- I have no idea.
- The Nutcracker.

14:24.627 --> 14:25.711
Step back, bitch.

14:25.794 --> 14:28.172
Holy mother of Mozart.

14:30.090 --> 14:31.175
This is bad.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.969
You didn't know Jackie Chan
was in the house, did you boys, huh?

14:34.053 --> 14:36.013
Stop that. Stop that now.

14:36.138 --> 14:38.432
Those knob-slobbers started it.

14:38.557 --> 14:41.185
That's not true, sir.
We simply reminded him to wear his beanie.

14:41.268 --> 14:43.646
And then he viciously assaulted
Brandon's genitals.

14:43.729 --> 14:48.192
- That's a lie, you dick-snot.
- Oscar, Jimmy, escort this man to see...

14:48.442 --> 14:50.736
- the Macro.
- The what?

14:51.236 --> 14:53.447
- You're dead.
- Now, gentlemen.

14:54.323 --> 14:56.450
God, Brandon, are you okay?

14:57.534 --> 15:00.079
You want to tell me
what the hell you're doing here, Stifler?

15:00.162 --> 15:02.706
It don't matter, Big O.
He ain't gonna be here long.

15:02.790 --> 15:03.874
- Bitch!
- Get over here.

15:03.999 --> 15:06.210
Macro gonna fuck your ass up, fool.

15:06.293 --> 15:08.837
- What the fuck's a macro?
- The Macro.

15:08.963 --> 15:11.173
Morale And Conflict Resolution Officer.

15:11.257 --> 15:13.634
I heard this one time,
this kid went into that office...

15:13.717 --> 15:15.427
a baritone and came out a soprano.

15:15.552 --> 15:18.472
- Clarinet up the ass backwards, yo.
- What?

15:26.063 --> 15:27.398
Pussies.

15:41.287 --> 15:42.663
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:44.832 --> 15:46.959
Frankenstein.  Scary stuff.

15:48.252 --> 15:50.629
I am just a Boris Karloff nut.

15:50.963 --> 15:55.009
- I'm the Macro, Mr. Levenstein.
- Holy shit, you're Jim's dad.

15:55.634 --> 15:58.596
He screwed that redheaded nympho chick
at my lake house.

15:58.679 --> 16:02.349
- Oh, my, you're not a Stifler?
- Yeah, I'm Steve's brother, Matt.

16:03.809 --> 16:07.396
- There are two Stiflers?
- Yes, sir. Hey, what're you doing here?

16:07.521 --> 16:11.525
Oh, well, Jim is now out of the house,
married to Michelle...

16:11.609 --> 16:14.778
that redheaded nympho chick
that you spoke of.

16:16.030 --> 16:18.949
And, being a former
Tall Oaks Counselor of the Year...

16:19.074 --> 16:24.204
she was hired to be the Macro this summer,
but she got pregnant.

16:24.538 --> 16:27.958
No doubt due to the tendencies
you alluded to earlier.

16:28.083 --> 16:31.086
And I have a great rapport with
young people...

16:31.211 --> 16:33.589
so I just stepped in and volunteered.

16:33.714 --> 16:37.217
That cretin is not in our band,
and we are not responsible for his actions.

16:37.343 --> 16:40.095
- Who pissed in your piccolo?
- I'm sensing some hostility here.

16:40.179 --> 16:41.513
- He poisoned my band.
- What?

16:41.597 --> 16:44.600
- I'm the Macro and it's my job to deal with...
- What is he doing here?

16:44.683 --> 16:48.103
- Matt Stifler is pure evil just like his brother.
... conflict.

16:48.187 --> 16:49.647
Thanks, Leesy.

16:54.485 --> 16:56.070
She seems nice.

16:57.029 --> 16:58.489
There are rules, of course.

16:58.572 --> 17:00.282
- You will have to wear a beanie.
- Yeah.

17:00.366 --> 17:03.786
Oh, I know. It's a little silly,
but it's tradition here...

17:03.869 --> 17:07.455
something you're familiar with,
being on the football team, I'm sure...

17:07.580 --> 17:11.085
with your elephant walks and circle jerks
and drinking butt beer.

17:11.210 --> 17:13.503
But here, you just have to wear
a silly little hat and...

17:13.628 --> 17:16.173
- a somewhat stylish Tall Oaks T-shirt.
- Yeah.

17:16.799 --> 17:18.842
So, just go with the flow, Matt...

17:18.925 --> 17:21.303
and you will have loads of fun...

17:21.720 --> 17:24.723
and you'll be making new friends in no time.

17:31.772 --> 17:34.608
Hey, Ernie Kaplowitz, tenor sax.

17:35.943 --> 17:38.570
Cool! I'm a rookie here, too.

17:38.821 --> 17:42.741
I really wanted to come last year,
but Computer Camp conflicted, and...

17:42.908 --> 17:47.037
Oh, yeah, that was here when I arrived.
I think it has your name on it.

17:49.164 --> 17:50.541
What is it?

17:52.334 --> 17:56.005
Hi, welcome to Casa de Stifler.
I'll be your host, Matt.

17:56.171 --> 17:59.675
Every day here, I'll make it my sincere goal
not to have to kick your ass.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.636
Allow me to show you
to your new accommodations.

18:03.679 --> 18:06.307
When I'm out here, you're in there.

18:07.516 --> 18:09.560
Have a great day, fucko.

18:09.852 --> 18:11.020
I don't...

18:14.481 --> 18:15.649
Okay...

18:15.733 --> 18:17.359
I'll just go and put this stuff away for you.

18:17.484 --> 18:18.736
All right. Bandee-vision.

18:21.530 --> 18:25.743
This is a 1978 Ohio State show...

18:25.868 --> 18:27.244
The Wizard Of Oz.

18:27.328 --> 18:31.081
The one where the sousaphone player
forgot to dot the I? Oh, hey.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.794
Yeah, right. Freaks.

18:37.796 --> 18:40.257
Never fear, the Stiffmeister's here.

18:40.341 --> 18:43.510
Band Camp just got
a whole lot better, ladies.

18:43.636 --> 18:46.180
You're Steve Stifler's younger brother,
aren't you?

18:46.305 --> 18:48.098
- Young and hung.
- Great.

18:48.265 --> 18:51.602
- Could you send him a message for me?
- No problem, senorita.

18:58.776 --> 19:03.155
Well, it looks like Steve gave someone
the old Stifler bang-and-boot.

19:04.281 --> 19:07.534
- Is there a problem here?
- No, everything's fine.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.873
- Have fun at Band Camp.
- Thank you, I will.

19:16.877 --> 19:19.171
- Later.
- Word.

19:19.713 --> 19:22.466
You need to start showing some respect
around here, Stifler.

19:22.591 --> 19:26.011
You need to show yourself
back to your table, Big Dog.

19:26.095 --> 19:27.888
Out of my way, Yo.

19:29.306 --> 19:33.352
Hola, chicas.
Elyse, so good to see you again.

19:33.686 --> 19:36.772
So, what's going on tonight?
We gonna party, get a little crazy?

19:36.897 --> 19:39.441
Who wants to rack up
a few frequent fucker miles?

19:39.566 --> 19:42.653
- You know, you are the most...
- Most sexy man ever to come to Band Camp.

19:42.736 --> 19:46.782
- What? Chloe, he is so obnoxious.
- Sexy obnoxious.

19:46.865 --> 19:49.952
- Thank you.
- I'm tired of messing around with these...

19:50.035 --> 19:51.912
dorky-ass nice guys...

19:52.079 --> 19:54.290
and sensitive-artist types.

19:54.707 --> 19:59.253
- Let's party with a real hombre tonight.
- Hell, yeah. That's me:

19:59.795 --> 20:03.799
- 100% hombre.
- All right, my room, 8:00.

20:04.967 --> 20:08.637
Great first day, campers.
This is your Macro speaking...

20:08.721 --> 20:12.224
and, hey, morale
couldn't have been higher today.

20:12.349 --> 20:15.102
So hop in the sack,
and get a good night's sleep because...

20:16.520 --> 20:19.440
starting tomorrow, we have
many, many exciting activities planned...

20:19.523 --> 20:23.277
not the least of which is
the race for the Tall Oaks Cup.

20:23.444 --> 20:25.487
So let the games begin.

20:25.779 --> 20:29.700
Bandeez Gone Wild.
Scene One. Party hombre.

20:34.622 --> 20:38.918
It's called Strip Trivia. We made it up.
It's a Band Camp tradition.

20:39.293 --> 20:43.589
"Fourth and Long," "Sextuplets,"
"Banging Babes," and "Who Blew Me?"

20:43.714 --> 20:46.884
This looks like my kind of game.
Shall we play?

20:47.885 --> 20:50.888
You sit in the middle.
Your game, my seating chart.

20:51.013 --> 20:52.556
Sit a little closer, ladies.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.934
Don't be scared. It's all right.

20:55.059 --> 20:56.226
Okay...

20:56.518 --> 20:59.521
the rules are simple.
You choose a category and a question...

20:59.605 --> 21:02.066
and every time you miss, you strip.

21:02.149 --> 21:03.233
Hell, yeah.

21:03.317 --> 21:06.987
- I'll go first. "Who Blew Me?"
- Good.

21:10.282 --> 21:14.745
I am a silver Stradivarius trumpet
played by a Pulitzer Prize winner.

21:15.788 --> 21:17.122
Who blew me?

21:17.289 --> 21:19.750
- Yeah, like I'd know.
- Sorry.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.460
Lose the shoes, and pick again.

21:21.543 --> 21:23.504
You didn't tell me this shit was about music.

21:23.587 --> 21:27.174
- Well, it is Band Camp, moron.
- Hey, to be fair...

21:27.508 --> 21:30.511
maybe we should just give him a head start.

21:34.098 --> 21:35.808
All right. Yeah.

21:37.017 --> 21:38.727
Okay, all right. All right.

21:40.354 --> 21:43.274
What's wrong with you?
Scared to show off the mosquito bites?

21:43.357 --> 21:46.110
I've matured since the fourth grade, Matt.
Have you?

21:46.193 --> 21:49.196
Oh, I've got 10 pounds of dangling maturity
right here, Leesy.

21:49.321 --> 21:52.283
- Quit calling me that.
- Okay, okay, moving on.

21:52.992 --> 21:57.204
- Matt, just pick another question, please.
- All right, screw it. Whatever.

21:57.871 --> 22:00.082
There you go. Suck on that.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.378
- Fourth and Long.
- Sure, no problem.

22:07.673 --> 22:12.136
Of Beethoven's major symphonies,
which has the longest fourth movement?

22:13.095 --> 22:14.972
All right, I see where this is going.

22:15.055 --> 22:17.766
Fine, you win.

22:22.229 --> 22:23.480
I free ball, ladies.

22:24.148 --> 22:28.360
Got to let the big boys breathe.
All right, we play by my rules now.

22:28.819 --> 22:31.739
Football questions only.
Prepare to strip, ladies.

22:32.489 --> 22:36.076
- Wait. But first, does anybody want a beer?
- I do.

22:36.577 --> 22:41.540
The counselors have a secret stash
in the fridge across the hall.

22:41.707 --> 22:45.544
- Would you mind?
- Now we're talking about a fucking party.

22:45.669 --> 22:47.463
Stiffy'll be back in a jiffy.

22:49.757 --> 22:52.301
I mean, there's nobody around...

22:52.426 --> 22:54.803
and we haven't seen your best side yet.

23:01.477 --> 23:03.687
Yes! We got him.

23:05.773 --> 23:07.566
So busted.

23:15.366 --> 23:17.910
Man, big boys, wake up.

23:17.993 --> 23:20.454
Just gotta turn down the A.C. In there, huh?

23:20.579 --> 23:21.747
Good night, girls.

23:29.129 --> 23:31.757
Sorry, asshole, game's over.

23:31.966 --> 23:36.345
Yeah, the big boys
will love the long walk home.

23:37.263 --> 23:39.056
Room check, girls.

23:40.516 --> 23:41.600
Oh, shit.

23:41.976 --> 23:44.186
- Ditch his clothes.
- Out the window.

23:44.979 --> 23:47.439
All right, who wants a long neck?

23:54.321 --> 23:56.031
Nurse Sanders.

23:58.867 --> 24:01.328
- They set me up.
- He attacked us with pepper spray...

24:01.453 --> 24:04.164
- and ruined our graduation.
- I went there for a friendly game...

24:04.248 --> 24:05.332
Hold it. Hold it. Kids.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.459
Okay...

24:07.710 --> 24:09.420
where are your clothes?

24:12.131 --> 24:13.591
I have them.

24:14.216 --> 24:16.176
- May I ask why?
- Well, they got me naked...

24:16.302 --> 24:19.555
- Oh, whatever. He took his own pants off...
- And they stole my clothes.

24:19.638 --> 24:22.391
And I got stuck up there
with Mrs. Doubtfire checking out my...

24:28.564 --> 24:30.524
Let me see if I have this straight.

24:30.691 --> 24:35.321
Elyse, you think Matt is an arrogant jock
who wears his penis on his forehead...

24:35.446 --> 24:38.866
just to gain the approval of
his sociopathic brother.

24:38.949 --> 24:42.870
And Matt, you think Elyse
is an uptight, geeky prude...

24:42.953 --> 24:45.706
who needs to loosen up and get laid.

24:45.789 --> 24:48.959
Excuse the expression, dear.
Is that close to being on the money?

24:50.753 --> 24:51.921
Look, kids...

24:53.380 --> 24:55.925
the only way to solve your differences...

24:56.634 --> 24:58.260
is by working together.

24:59.470 --> 25:01.263
So why don't you start tomorrow...

25:01.680 --> 25:04.767
by putting one foot in front of the other?

25:08.437 --> 25:10.230
Left flank hut.

25:12.691 --> 25:14.151
Turn and hut.

25:21.867 --> 25:23.118
What the fuck!

25:24.662 --> 25:26.455
Band 10 hut!

25:26.747 --> 25:27.748
Holy shit.

25:28.332 --> 25:31.835
When I yell "band 10 hut,"
you snap firmly at attention.

25:31.961 --> 25:35.631
- You want to see me firmly at attention?
- I already have. I wasn't impressed.

25:38.592 --> 25:39.760
Look...

25:40.678 --> 25:42.638
we've never beaten Beechwood, okay?

25:43.555 --> 25:45.432
For some of us, it's our last shot.

25:48.269 --> 25:49.853
Just stop screwing up, okay?

25:49.937 --> 25:51.355
Yeah, asshole.

25:53.941 --> 25:56.151
Okay, people, back to work, let's go.
Whatever.

25:56.277 --> 25:57.653
I don't need this shit.

25:57.736 --> 26:00.197
Reset the block. Front ranks, right here.

26:14.169 --> 26:15.504
Housekeeping.

26:42.948 --> 26:45.326
Oscar, brought me something to drink?

26:45.659 --> 26:48.662
- Come on.
- Good looking out, baby.

26:51.248 --> 26:52.958
Hey, it's Ernie Crapowitz.

26:53.083 --> 26:56.170
So you finally came out of the closet.
Good for you.

26:57.588 --> 27:00.132
Look, I want to know
what goes on at night, all right?

27:00.215 --> 27:02.843
All the crazy shit.
Naked pillow fights, whatever.

27:02.927 --> 27:06.430
Do I look like the guy that's in charge of
the naked pillow fights, huh?

27:06.513 --> 27:08.057
It's my first time here.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.308
Notice the beanie?

27:09.433 --> 27:10.517
Yes.

27:11.518 --> 27:12.978
Yes, I do.

27:13.062 --> 27:16.398
Yes, speaking of beanies,
where's yours, Stifler?

27:16.774 --> 27:18.734
You still not following the rules, huh?

27:18.817 --> 27:20.694
- Let's see.
- Look. He's getting in trouble again.

27:20.819 --> 27:24.240
No standard-issue Tall Oaks T-shirt
and no beanie.

27:24.323 --> 27:27.660
I believe that's two points from Great Falls,
Mr. Nelson.

27:27.910 --> 27:29.787
Tell you what, Vande-cramp...

27:30.120 --> 27:32.873
what if I took his beanie...

27:32.998 --> 27:35.751
and put it on my weenie?

27:35.834 --> 27:39.880
How do you like that Vande-cramp?
It's on my head, right?

27:40.089 --> 27:42.299
Make it five points from Great Falls.

27:42.508 --> 27:43.759
Five points.

27:43.884 --> 27:47.054
Man, this place sucks donkey ass.

27:52.142 --> 27:53.852
Put your beanie on, Son.

27:59.733 --> 28:01.694
Five points.

28:25.050 --> 28:27.344
Stay still. Stop moving.

28:27.428 --> 28:29.138
He ain't going nowhere now.

28:29.263 --> 28:32.600
This isn't your world. This is our
world, and we don't want you in it.

28:32.683 --> 28:34.893
You already cost us
five points in the standings.

28:35.019 --> 28:36.812
We can't have that.

28:37.062 --> 28:38.772
Set the man up with his beanie.

28:46.530 --> 28:48.407
Now you're representing, fool.

28:48.532 --> 28:49.783
And this toothpaste...

28:49.909 --> 28:52.620
this will make up
for the pepper spray, asshole.

29:06.508 --> 29:08.052
Oh, shit.

29:08.761 --> 29:11.138
I'll get the paint thinner
from maintenance.

29:12.765 --> 29:14.141
Animals.

29:24.610 --> 29:28.739
Matt, you were sent here...

29:29.156 --> 29:30.616
to make a change.

29:30.783 --> 29:34.536
And, so far, you've only had
your sinuses sanitized. So...

29:34.912 --> 29:37.289
I think it's time to try a new approach.

29:37.790 --> 29:39.583
Make some friends.

29:41.335 --> 29:43.128
Earn their trust.

29:45.422 --> 29:47.716
Why would I want to earn their trust?

29:50.970 --> 29:52.513
Good.

29:59.687 --> 30:01.730
Welcome to Stifler-vision.

30:01.855 --> 30:04.316
I think there's
a cymbal class at 1:00.

30:04.525 --> 30:05.693
I hate that.

30:05.818 --> 30:08.028
Yeah, but it's better than
the bass drum relay.

30:08.112 --> 30:09.363
Yeah, that's true.

30:19.957 --> 30:22.167
Yours look totally fantastic.

30:22.251 --> 30:25.504
Two for the price of one.
My left one's bigger, see?

30:25.588 --> 30:28.507
- Yeah, mine, too, baby.
- They can totally fix that.

30:44.523 --> 30:46.233
- No!
- Want to see?

30:46.358 --> 30:48.902
- I used to be...
- Lens fog. No!

31:00.247 --> 31:04.084
- What is that thing, butt weasel?
- Yeah, it's the KR3, baby.

31:04.209 --> 31:07.880
The Kaplowitz Remote Robotic Rover.
And you are so busted.

31:07.963 --> 31:11.550
- Hey, Oscar, somebody call the Macro.
- Dude, please, shut up.

31:11.634 --> 31:15.387
Pull your panties out of your ass.
I can help you with that chick.

31:19.183 --> 31:20.267
What chick?

31:20.351 --> 31:22.811
Dude, the one with all the tattoos.
The Tubanator.

31:22.937 --> 31:24.396
Her name is Chloe.

31:25.022 --> 31:28.359
Come on, man. I can help.
I'm the Stiffmeister.

31:28.484 --> 31:31.278
- Master of love and romance.
- Bullshit.

31:31.445 --> 31:35.908
I nailed three cheerleaders in one week
on spring break. College cheerleaders.

31:46.418 --> 31:48.879
And I know why your camera spritzed out.

31:51.632 --> 31:53.592
Dude, this thing is awesome.

31:54.176 --> 31:57.263
- You ever use this to look up chicks' skirts?
- No.

31:57.346 --> 31:59.723
But I did use it to win
the State Science Fair last year.

31:59.807 --> 32:02.101
And I'm hoping it gets me into MIT next fall.

32:02.184 --> 32:04.228
I really want to work for NASA.

32:04.436 --> 32:06.897
National Anal Sex Association?

32:07.147 --> 32:08.857
No it's Space...

32:09.692 --> 32:14.321
- There's an Anal Sex Association?
- Oh, yeah, but you've got to be a pro.

32:15.948 --> 32:18.075
Wait, there's a Space Association?

32:19.660 --> 32:21.620
You were supposed to use this.

32:22.913 --> 32:27.126
- See, it's got an anti-fog lens. Duh.
- Yeah, good.

32:28.210 --> 32:33.090
- Can the robot record?
- All right, so, what are your intentions?

32:34.550 --> 32:37.011
With the video, I mean. What are you doing?

32:37.136 --> 32:38.679
Oh, it's just for fun.

32:38.971 --> 32:42.391
I mean, who doesn't like to look
at hot naked chicks, right?

32:43.892 --> 32:46.437
Keep it between us, and I'll let you watch.

32:46.770 --> 32:50.357
Plus, I'll have you giving Chloe
the pelvic noogie inside a week.

32:51.650 --> 32:53.611
Hey, Stifler. Phone.

32:53.819 --> 32:55.613
We're in Detroit!

32:56.280 --> 32:58.991
Locked into sweet Brazilian rum.

32:59.074 --> 33:01.827
I'm fucking fubar, man!

33:01.911 --> 33:06.206
I sent you rum today.
Could come in handy in Dorksville.

33:06.332 --> 33:07.958
This place blows.

33:09.209 --> 33:10.920
Hey, my roommate, Dr. Robot...

33:11.003 --> 33:13.130
busted me taping some college chicks
in the shower.

33:13.255 --> 33:15.382
So now I have to be all nice to him and shit.

33:15.466 --> 33:18.802
And I'm not getting any good footage
'cause these fucking bandees hate me.

33:20.554 --> 33:22.765
Think of it
like trying to hook up with a virgin.

33:22.848 --> 33:26.435
Act like you give a shit about them
until they bring you into the good stuff.

33:26.518 --> 33:28.395
Earn their trust?

33:29.021 --> 33:30.981
Dude, that could work.

33:31.106 --> 33:33.651
I'll be an undercover bandee fucker.

33:34.568 --> 33:38.072
Hello, everyone.
Isn't it a peachy day here at Band Camp?

33:38.280 --> 33:42.117
Band buds. How's it going? Yo.

33:42.910 --> 33:46.830
Hey, I just want to say thanks
for the little wakeup call. You kidders.

33:47.998 --> 33:51.085
Hey, I can finally hear
the music calling me, okay?

33:52.336 --> 33:55.172
There. Hear it? Yeah. Me, too.

33:55.422 --> 34:00.052
So I'm a totally new man, and... By the way,
you both look great in pantyhose.

34:10.478 --> 34:13.732
- What are you doing?
- Awaiting my marching lesson, ma'am.

34:13.857 --> 34:16.318
Look, Matt, I really don't have time for this
right now.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.905
No, look, I figure I'm here,
I might as well make the best of it.

34:20.030 --> 34:23.449
Matt, marching's hard, okay?
It's not like throwing some football.

34:23.534 --> 34:27.204
- Oh, you ever thrown into double coverage?
- You ever high-stepped in double time?

34:27.288 --> 34:30.791
Yes, ma'am, the time the cops chased us
across Koreno's Creek.

34:31.417 --> 34:34.295
And you got so scared, you cried.

34:35.045 --> 34:39.132
- I had allergies.
- It was winter, Mattie.

34:40.134 --> 34:43.554
Well, if you don't teach me to march,
I might just cry again.

34:47.181 --> 34:48.350
Fine.

34:48.641 --> 34:52.688
Left foot on one and three,
right foot on two and four.

34:52.771 --> 34:54.315
You have to do math?

35:02.907 --> 35:06.827
One, two, three, middle.
One, two, three, line.

35:06.911 --> 35:09.121
Right foot on four.

35:11.373 --> 35:13.918
- Keep your step size even.
- My what?

35:15.461 --> 35:18.964
All right, there we go, little buddy.
I'm gonna fix you up good.

35:20.466 --> 35:25.262
Any girl that knows how to play a tuba,
she can do things. That's what Stifler says.

35:25.387 --> 35:28.015
I don't know what it means,
but it's got to be good.

35:28.098 --> 35:29.350
You're good to go.

35:29.433 --> 35:30.976
Let's go find Chloe.

35:43.781 --> 35:44.949
Holy shit.

35:46.242 --> 35:49.495
What the hell? Who's doing this?

35:51.872 --> 35:52.957
Take it.

35:53.082 --> 35:54.166
It's okay.

36:03.842 --> 36:07.429
- Thanks, little creepy machine.
- You're welcome...

36:07.846 --> 36:09.556
beautiful lady.

36:24.863 --> 36:29.159
With my right, with my right,
but I can also do it with my left, with my left.

36:32.663 --> 36:33.747
Bootie.

36:35.165 --> 36:36.250
Good game.

36:42.506 --> 36:44.300
You just touched my bootie.

36:51.390 --> 36:53.767
- What's that?
- Your instrument.

36:54.268 --> 36:56.061
That's fucking gay.

36:57.104 --> 36:59.231
- I mean lame.
- Good.

37:00.024 --> 37:02.860
Now, there are two positions.

37:03.527 --> 37:07.698
Carrying position, like this,
and playing position, like this.

37:07.865 --> 37:09.575
Now when I call, "horns up"...

37:09.658 --> 37:11.702
you're gonna move your instrument out,
and then...

37:11.827 --> 37:13.454
Hello, losers.

37:13.662 --> 37:17.416
Matt. Oh, my God. Matt, I am so sorry.

37:17.541 --> 37:19.752
- I think I bit a hole in my tongue.
- Oh, let me see.

37:19.877 --> 37:22.421
- No, no hole.
- On today's...

37:22.504 --> 37:25.841
episode wasting time on lost causes.

37:26.550 --> 37:30.679
Speaking of which, I understand you
composed the music to your show, Elyse...

37:30.763 --> 37:32.389
if you call that music.

37:32.473 --> 37:34.934
Yeah. That's right. I did.

37:35.017 --> 37:37.227
And who'd your daddy hire
to compose yours?

37:37.311 --> 37:42.274
I'm just giving you fair warning, cupcake.
Robards Scholarship is mine.

37:42.775 --> 37:44.151
Like you need it.

37:44.485 --> 37:47.488
It's not a matter of need.
It's a matter of want.

37:47.780 --> 37:51.200
- Yeah, I get what I want.
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?

37:51.283 --> 37:52.534
Matt, don't.

37:53.577 --> 37:56.330
- What are you going to do?
- Kick your ass.

37:56.538 --> 37:58.332
- Are you challenging me?
- No.

37:58.415 --> 38:01.752
- Yeah, what if I am?
- No, Brandon, that is not what he's doing.

38:01.877 --> 38:04.713
I accept. Amphitheatre, 5:00.

38:05.089 --> 38:07.925
It's been three years
since I've been challenged.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.094
We got a challenge.

38:12.805 --> 38:15.182
I look forward to reminding people why.

38:16.016 --> 38:17.518
East Great Falls.

38:17.810 --> 38:19.937
I'll see you there, asshole.

38:21.814 --> 38:25.651
- Do you know what you just did?
- Doesn't matter. He's going down.

38:25.734 --> 38:28.404
Matt, you challenged him to a duel.

38:28.696 --> 38:29.863
With swords?

38:30.531 --> 38:34.368
No, you idiot.
You each get on stage and perform.

38:34.451 --> 38:36.495
And the crowd decides who wins.

38:36.996 --> 38:38.872
Can't we just do keg stands?

38:39.498 --> 38:43.877
Matt, this is serious, okay?
Beechwood gets five points if he wins...

38:44.003 --> 38:47.256
which, you know, he will
because he plays an instrument.

38:47.506 --> 38:49.300
Well, so do I.

38:49.842 --> 38:52.636
Let the Tall Oaks
Battle Royale begin.

38:53.220 --> 38:56.056
The prize is five points towards the cup.

38:57.016 --> 38:58.976
Okay, Brandon, you're up first.

39:42.978 --> 39:44.229
Come on!

39:46.607 --> 39:49.151
Suck on that, bitch.

39:50.194 --> 39:51.445
Lame.

39:52.237 --> 39:53.781
This is so embarrassing.

39:53.906 --> 39:55.157
Okay, Brandon.

39:55.241 --> 39:56.867
Now you show him, Brandon.

40:14.802 --> 40:15.970
Take that!

40:27.648 --> 40:30.401
Well, seems this contest is over.

40:31.110 --> 40:33.487
Figures. We just lost five points.

40:36.115 --> 40:39.118
And the winner by forfeit is...

40:41.620 --> 40:43.247
But I know it's not his fault...

41:06.520 --> 41:08.230
You don't know the words.

41:30.044 --> 41:31.629
He should shave that.

41:34.465 --> 41:36.091
East Great Falls!

41:36.717 --> 41:38.510
East Great Falls!

41:38.844 --> 41:40.721
East Great Falls!

41:41.430 --> 41:43.057
East Great Falls!

41:46.226 --> 41:48.771
Okay, five points to Great Falls.

41:50.689 --> 41:52.650
All right, Great Falls!

41:55.069 --> 41:57.196
East Great Falls!

41:59.740 --> 42:00.574
East Great Falls!

42:01.659 --> 42:03.786
East Great Falls!

42:03.869 --> 42:05.829
East Great Falls!

42:07.456 --> 42:09.166
Hey, hey...

42:09.250 --> 42:11.293
- Hey.
- What?

42:11.418 --> 42:13.963
- Are you really Scottish?
- Fuck, no.

42:15.005 --> 42:16.382
My mum made me learn an instrument.

42:16.465 --> 42:18.342
That's the most annoying one
I could think of.

42:18.425 --> 42:22.179
I think you were just born
to squeeze sacks and blow pipes, Stifler.

42:22.429 --> 42:23.764
Hey, Oscar.

42:28.477 --> 42:31.146
How many other Oscars
do you know? Go!

42:33.524 --> 42:35.901
- What's up?
- Your drum line sounds pretty tight.

42:36.026 --> 42:37.111
Oh, thanks.

42:37.194 --> 42:39.238
You let me know
if you want to learn some new moves.

42:39.446 --> 42:40.531
Really?

42:40.656 --> 42:43.367
- He's gonna screw it up.
- He's definitely gonna screw it up.

42:44.910 --> 42:49.123
- Thanks for winning those points back.
- I lost them. I had to get them back.

42:49.999 --> 42:53.085
Hey, guys,
Sheree's gonna show me some moves.

42:53.627 --> 42:54.712
Hey, gang...

42:54.795 --> 42:59.174
just a little reminder that as the battle
for the cup heats up, let's try to remember...

43:00.384 --> 43:03.887
to keep up that Tall Oaks spirit of fair play
and friendly competition.

43:04.722 --> 43:07.099
We'll have enough spit for a six-pack.

43:10.352 --> 43:13.314
- Yeah, baby, you did me proud, son.
- Thanks, J. Lo.

43:13.397 --> 43:14.857
It's cool. Big O?

43:15.232 --> 43:18.235
Quite a little show you put on
yesterday, Stifler.

43:18.402 --> 43:21.238
You know,
these plebes think you're some kind of hero.

43:21.322 --> 43:23.532
I don't know what a plebe is, Vande-creep.

43:23.657 --> 43:26.827
Didn't anybody tell you not to mess
with the big dog while he's eating?

43:26.952 --> 43:29.705
It's mine, jerk-wad.
Now will you give it back?

43:31.165 --> 43:34.418
- Dildos.
- This is still my camp, asshole.

43:34.668 --> 43:37.212
- You're going down.
- No, I'm not.

43:37.296 --> 43:38.380
But your mum did last night.

43:38.505 --> 43:41.842
Did she play the trumpet?
Because she has really strong lips.

43:42.092 --> 43:43.344
That's right.

43:59.068 --> 44:00.235
Yummy.

44:03.989 --> 44:05.950
That's what I'm talking about.

44:07.159 --> 44:10.120
- What happened this time, Claire?
- Well, I was working on my solo...

44:10.204 --> 44:11.664
and I hurt myself.

44:12.539 --> 44:14.333
I've been fucking poisoned.

44:15.668 --> 44:18.379
Ipecac is a natural herbal extract...

44:18.462 --> 44:21.465
that triggers the regurgitation reflex.

44:25.844 --> 44:28.555
Whatever's in there
should be out soon enough.

44:28.847 --> 44:30.557
Like him, if we're lucky.

44:32.601 --> 44:36.188
Well, I'm pretty sure
it's probably just something...

44:36.563 --> 44:40.943
you had for lunch, you know? I've got
the same problem. Very sensitive stomach.

44:41.568 --> 44:44.989
I was at a banquet once.
On the same plate, if you can believe it...

44:45.072 --> 44:50.286
they had creamed venison, squid fritters,
and jellied pork.

44:55.916 --> 44:57.001
What?

45:17.938 --> 45:20.649
- Hey, what's up, crust bucket?
- Come here, dude. Check this out.

45:20.733 --> 45:24.403
So, this afternoon, while the counselors
were practicing for the talent show...

45:24.486 --> 45:27.031
I faked an asthma attack,
and I changed both of the cameras.

45:31.285 --> 45:33.954
It's their talent show routine, au naturel.

45:34.330 --> 45:37.041
Dude, you filthy little cyberfucker. Shit.

45:37.875 --> 45:42.338
- Hey, I thought we were just going to watch.
- Exactly, we may want to watch it again.

45:48.802 --> 45:53.682
Hey, so, I took your advice about Chloe.
I used the Rover to deliver a soda.

45:54.266 --> 45:58.103
- That was your cool, crazy idea?
- Yeah, I think she actually liked it.

45:58.187 --> 46:01.190
- Yeah, that sounds gay.
- It's not gay.

46:02.775 --> 46:05.653
Anyway, there's
this bonfire-slushee party tonight...

46:05.736 --> 46:08.989
and I really need to know Step Two
in the Stiffmeister plan.

46:09.073 --> 46:12.660
Slushee party. Really.

46:12.993 --> 46:14.578
Special delivery.

46:14.703 --> 46:16.413
Prepare to jam with the bearded clam.

46:17.706 --> 46:19.250
Get ready to cuddle the love puddle.

46:19.375 --> 46:22.711
The time has come for Dr. Robot to get laid.

46:22.920 --> 46:24.004
Get laid?

46:24.171 --> 46:26.840
I told you, trust the Stiffmeister.

46:27.091 --> 46:29.843
Meister means "master" in German.

46:30.761 --> 46:35.057
Get her drunk? That's the secret
of the ages? That's Step Number Two?

46:35.182 --> 46:40.145
No, actually, it's Step Four. You don't have
the balls for Two or the tongue for Three.

46:40.312 --> 46:41.772
I've got the balls.

46:42.356 --> 46:44.900
Hey, you haven't heard Step Five yet.

46:48.696 --> 46:52.366
Born to be wild

46:56.036 --> 46:59.707
Well, I'm hot blooded
Check it and see

47:00.082 --> 47:03.836
I've got a fever of 103

47:03.961 --> 47:06.714
Come on baby
Do you do more than dance?

47:08.549 --> 47:11.302
- This is some good shit.
- Don't enjoy it too much.

47:11.427 --> 47:14.847
- We have a big practice tomorrow, you guys.
- Relax, Leesy.

47:15.306 --> 47:18.475
Suckle the tender fruits
of Band Camp with your friends.

47:18.642 --> 47:22.396
Come on, Elyse. Cut loose a little bit.
Have some fun.

47:22.521 --> 47:23.856
I am having fun.

47:23.939 --> 47:26.942
Hey, horn dog, let's go get
some more of these before they run out.

47:27.026 --> 47:29.403
- All right.
- Horn dog?

47:29.528 --> 47:34.074
Yeah, it's his nickname. Dude will stick
his dick into anything. It's unnatural.

47:35.075 --> 47:38.913
Check it, dawg. This one time
at Band Camp, I fucked an oboe.

47:39.997 --> 47:42.374
- Really?
- Blow in it for a while...

47:42.458 --> 47:47.087
get that wood nice and warm,
slap on some valve oil and go to town, yo.

47:47.296 --> 47:49.423
Hey, maybe you should try a flute.

47:54.094 --> 47:56.555
Now's a good time
to teach you those moves.

47:56.680 --> 47:57.681
Really?

48:03.354 --> 48:04.521
What?

48:18.994 --> 48:20.371
I know what you're doing.

48:20.454 --> 48:24.583
- You do?
- It's what you always do. You're a fake.

48:24.833 --> 48:27.920
You do whatever it takes
to be the centre of attention.

48:28.045 --> 48:31.882
Just like when we were kids,
around me, you were regular old Matt...

48:32.258 --> 48:35.594
but around Steve and his friends,
you were the Stiffmeister.

48:36.762 --> 48:38.389
Who're you going to be tonight?

48:38.514 --> 48:40.140
Hey, cheese dick...

48:40.224 --> 48:44.687
why don't you quit being such a fucking
taint licker, and get me another slushee.

48:44.770 --> 48:46.730
Fucking puss monkey.

48:54.572 --> 48:57.116
You know what?
I am going to have some fun.

49:05.165 --> 49:08.252
Fucking hoes, man. I don't get that shit.

49:08.377 --> 49:12.298
I mean, right now, Oscar's off in the woods
tapping that counselor biatch, Sheree.

49:12.381 --> 49:15.175
- What's up with that?
- That cock spring is getting laid?

49:15.259 --> 49:18.262
True that. And here we are,
the two dopest homeboys in camp...

49:18.345 --> 49:22.641
and we ain't got no prospects
for our palm pilots. That's fucked up, dawg.

49:23.017 --> 49:25.060
Dude, I gotta see this.

49:28.689 --> 49:30.566
- Use your hips more.
- Hips, like that?

49:30.691 --> 49:34.612
Yeah, now faster. Yeah. Like that.
A circle. Like that.

49:34.695 --> 49:38.866
Crikey! The alpha female
has chosen an unlikely mate.

49:38.949 --> 49:41.577
Will he survive this dangerous encounter...

49:41.827 --> 49:46.206
or will she satisfy her primal needs
and then devour him for dinner?

49:46.540 --> 49:48.167
Stay tuned.

49:48.584 --> 49:52.421
I'm sorry. I'm really no good
at this stuff.

49:52.546 --> 49:54.590
Relax. You're doing fine.

49:58.010 --> 49:59.470
This sucks.

49:59.845 --> 50:02.389
How's that feel? Oscar.

50:02.973 --> 50:05.100
Is that your drumstick poking me?

50:06.310 --> 50:08.270
I don't have my drumsticks.

50:08.354 --> 50:11.148
Are you standing up for me again, Oscar?

50:11.690 --> 50:13.400
It's getting hot.

50:13.692 --> 50:16.612
Smack my ass and call me cowboy.

50:17.404 --> 50:19.615
Hello, Double-D Sheree.

50:20.074 --> 50:21.784
Hips. Hips.

50:22.076 --> 50:23.702
- Use your hips.
- Oh, yeah, hips.

50:23.827 --> 50:25.621
And step, and...

50:28.874 --> 50:29.959
Who knew?

50:31.043 --> 50:32.419
Wow.

50:44.473 --> 50:46.850
Yo, we at Tall Oaks
Sipping on juice

50:46.976 --> 50:49.270
Got horns, trumpets
Rhythm and flutes

50:49.353 --> 50:51.647
Great Falls laying it down

50:51.772 --> 50:54.316
Gonna ride fucking Beechwood
out of the town

50:54.400 --> 50:56.777
J.C., what, rocking the bunch

50:56.860 --> 50:59.947
All tripped out on the fucking fruit punch

51:06.912 --> 51:10.249
- I just want to be respectful.
- Oh, that's sweet.

51:18.632 --> 51:21.176
The only person who's gonna get laid
around here.

51:30.352 --> 51:32.396
Hello, oeoe.

51:49.288 --> 51:50.998
This is so cool.

51:52.583 --> 51:56.879
I hope I didn't scare you
with the Rover and the soda.

51:57.046 --> 51:59.173
No, man, it was cute.

51:59.924 --> 52:03.510
Nobody's ever been that sweet to me
in my whole life.

52:04.094 --> 52:05.638
Plus, to be honest...

52:06.096 --> 52:09.183
metal really turns me on.

52:36.001 --> 52:38.128
Man, the shit's stuck.

53:02.695 --> 53:05.155
- Turn off the lights.
- Damn, gangsta.

53:05.281 --> 53:07.950
- I was just fucking with you, dawg!
- You... It's stuck.

53:08.033 --> 53:10.411
- Shit, you want help?
- Don't touch me.

53:11.996 --> 53:13.080
Come on.

53:13.831 --> 53:15.374
Maybe you should blow on it.

53:15.499 --> 53:17.209
Maybe you should blow on it
and I'll pull.

53:17.293 --> 53:19.420
Hell, no. Jimmy ain't putting his lips
on that thing.

53:19.545 --> 53:21.005
Jimmy should be a team player.

53:21.088 --> 53:23.299
- Try and relax, dawg.
- Not so hard.

53:23.424 --> 53:24.967
Oh, my God!

53:31.974 --> 53:35.477
- I was just trying to help him get it off, yo.
- Dude, shut up.

53:35.561 --> 53:36.645
Whatever.

53:36.770 --> 53:38.814
He had an allergic reaction to the valve oil.

53:38.897 --> 53:41.567
The swelling should go down
in a few minutes.

53:41.817 --> 53:45.946
These kinds of things would never happen
with our old Macro.

54:06.967 --> 54:09.803
We didn't have MTV when I was growing up.

54:11.138 --> 54:13.682
So maybe it's the over-stimulated times...

54:13.807 --> 54:17.937
that we live in
that causes young men to stick their...

54:18.646 --> 54:21.523
instruments in such odd places.

54:23.442 --> 54:25.027
I knew a certain young man once...

54:25.110 --> 54:28.364
who actually engaged in sexual congress
with an apple pie.

54:28.572 --> 54:30.449
And he turned out just fine.

54:30.991 --> 54:33.911
So, you're perfectly normal...

54:35.037 --> 54:36.622
as these things go.

54:54.974 --> 54:58.060
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

54:58.185 --> 55:02.648
I'm so drunk right now.
I'm probably going to forget about you...

55:04.149 --> 55:06.193
porking an oboe.

55:15.327 --> 55:17.037
I have six piercings.

55:18.539 --> 55:21.083
That doesn't include the ones on my face.

55:34.597 --> 55:36.015
Two right here...

55:38.392 --> 55:41.395
and four down here.

55:53.157 --> 55:55.117
Haven't seen that in a while.

55:55.492 --> 56:00.539
Yeah, well, no time for dance.
It's all about band, band, band.

56:00.623 --> 56:02.583
No, I was talking about you having fun.

56:02.708 --> 56:06.211
- I have fun. I have fun all the time.
- Yeah.

56:06.337 --> 56:09.048
I just get stressed out, you know. I mean...

56:09.715 --> 56:11.926
we graduate next year, and I don't know.

56:12.009 --> 56:14.053
I mean, I don't really talk about it
all that much...

56:14.136 --> 56:17.056
because the cup is, like,
a team thing, and...

56:17.181 --> 56:20.267
But winning the Robards Scholarship,
I mean, that is like...

56:20.392 --> 56:22.102
my future, you know? And...

56:23.062 --> 56:25.898
Dr. Choi is coming. I mean...

56:26.065 --> 56:29.485
you don't understand. She's like famous...

56:29.985 --> 56:32.988
like holy-shit famous.
And, sometimes, I just...

56:34.031 --> 56:35.741
I get really stressed out...

56:35.824 --> 56:39.662
and I calm myself down
by going off and playing on my Picardo.

56:40.371 --> 56:43.082
Wait, you have... Picardo?

56:43.249 --> 56:45.793
It's just a cheapie, but I lost it.

56:46.168 --> 56:49.338
- Wait, if I somehow found this Picard thing...
- You found it?

56:49.630 --> 56:51.507
- Maybe.
- Give it back.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.384
If you let me watch.

56:54.343 --> 56:57.346
Okay, but it takes me a while to warm up.

56:57.471 --> 56:59.932
I have all the time in the world.

57:02.518 --> 57:03.602
Figures.

57:05.479 --> 57:08.023
But I'm going to have to be really drunk.

57:08.941 --> 57:12.278
I mean really drunk. Really drunk.

57:13.195 --> 57:14.196
Yes.

57:14.822 --> 57:16.282
Beat it, jerk off.

57:35.426 --> 57:37.720
Okay, people, let's take a break.

57:41.181 --> 57:43.309
We're all a little sluggish today.

57:45.102 --> 57:46.729
Man, we suck.

57:46.812 --> 57:50.316
Man, one night of fun was not worth
losing a whole day of practice.

57:54.069 --> 57:55.571
Give me this thing.

57:56.363 --> 57:58.908
All right, listen up,
you lazy bunch of lip shits.

57:59.033 --> 58:00.993
Those Beechwood plebes
aren't taking breaks.

58:01.076 --> 58:03.996
We want to win this thing,
we've gotta bust our asses.

58:04.330 --> 58:06.457
Come on, bitches. Back to work.

58:06.540 --> 58:09.335
- Matt, that's my job.
- Grab your cocks and move your socks.

58:09.418 --> 58:11.545
We're at war here, people, war!

58:11.629 --> 58:14.965
Show some tits. Grow some balls.
Hey, keep that thing warm for me.

58:15.090 --> 58:19.219
All right, now. What, you want to let
Beechwood tittie-fuck us? I didn't think so.

58:19.303 --> 58:20.638
All right, Tall Oakers...

58:20.721 --> 58:23.724
we're in our final week.
Time to put on our game faces.

58:23.849 --> 58:27.019
And time to strap yourselves in
for a bumpy ride.

58:27.102 --> 58:29.063
I want the oboe, clarinet, black thingies...

58:29.146 --> 58:31.941
and we've got the rhythm section
in a full-on blitz.

58:32.024 --> 58:34.151
- Are you with me, bandees?
- Yeah!

58:34.276 --> 58:37.029
MACRO: Competition for the Tall Oaks Cup
is really heating up.

58:40.741 --> 58:42.201
Beechwood wins.

58:44.453 --> 58:45.454
Whatever.

58:45.579 --> 58:46.914
I told you, you should let me steer.

58:46.997 --> 58:48.624
Take that bitch home, man.

58:49.041 --> 58:53.420
Drive it in. Hey, you, fuck face,
I don't even know where to start with you.

59:00.261 --> 59:03.847
Beechwood leads.
Great Falls and Lloyd are tied for second.

59:03.973 --> 59:06.016
Beechwood licks nuts. Hut!

59:14.608 --> 59:16.819
Victory, East Great Falls.

59:20.239 --> 59:22.366
Right foot on line.

59:24.118 --> 59:26.161
Jimmy, you fucking lotion lover.

59:33.335 --> 59:35.963
East Great Falls by four points.

59:45.598 --> 59:47.391
Hey, butt pirates ahoy.

59:48.350 --> 59:51.854
Your little band
may be leading in the competition, Stifler...

59:53.272 --> 59:55.899
but make sure to let us know
if you get thirsty.

59:55.983 --> 59:58.193
Yeah, 'cause there's plenty of this.

01:00:03.574 --> 01:00:07.494
That's funny for you dorks.
Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah.

01:00:07.745 --> 01:00:10.372
Man, screw that challenge.
I'm just gonna kick his ass.

01:00:10.456 --> 01:00:12.583
No, wait. I've got a better idea...

01:00:13.542 --> 01:00:15.586
if you think you're man enough.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.641
Yes.

01:00:28.766 --> 01:00:31.936
- Hey, you sure you can do this?
- Hey, born to be a porn star, baby.

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.479
Delivery on demand.

01:00:34.605 --> 01:00:37.608
When I get back,
I'll be a million Stiflers lighter.

01:03:05.673 --> 01:03:07.716
Brandon, I think you're
a really good drummer, so...

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.884
Excuse me.

01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:22.481
Hey, guys...

01:03:22.564 --> 01:03:26.318
don't forget your sunscreen.
Your bodies are your instruments.

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.445
Yeah, you don't want to be
chapped for your solos.

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:30.864
No, we don't. Bye now.

01:03:36.161 --> 01:03:38.372
What is that, 30? It's really thick.

01:03:48.757 --> 01:03:50.634
How's that taste, Vande-cock?

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.470
Good, huh? Warm and salty? Yeah.

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:57.349
It's a cum-pletely new formula.
100% Stiffy juice...

01:03:57.474 --> 01:03:59.602
S.P.F. 69.

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:07.610
Suck on that.

01:04:08.736 --> 01:04:10.362
- Yeah.
- Stop, man.

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.156
- Yeah.
- Ernie.

01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:13.574
- Yeah.
- Ernie.

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:25.586
What you had before
was way better than this.

01:04:25.669 --> 01:04:29.715
This sounds like
your overactive honor-society brain.

01:04:30.174 --> 01:04:33.928
Instead of your nasty, wet...

01:04:34.803 --> 01:04:36.263
dirty-girl panties.

01:04:37.222 --> 01:04:39.183
It should be more spontaneous.

01:04:42.186 --> 01:04:43.520
Stop.

01:04:43.604 --> 01:04:46.440
Maybe you should hang out
with your friend Matt a little bit more.

01:04:46.523 --> 01:04:47.524
Yeah, right.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.236
I know he's a dick and everything,
but he's also got one.

01:04:51.362 --> 01:04:55.616
Make some love music, you know?
And then your notes will just cum to you.

01:04:56.242 --> 01:04:59.411
- Oh, Matt!
- Stop.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.121
Matt. Matt.

01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:06.835
Go long, you asshole. Go.

01:05:07.628 --> 01:05:09.505
Hey, Elyse.

01:05:10.756 --> 01:05:12.716
Throw it back. Come on.

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:14.969
What you got?

01:05:22.643 --> 01:05:24.019
Missed. Sorry.

01:05:25.646 --> 01:05:27.356
Hey, if I have to ring the triangle...

01:05:27.398 --> 01:05:29.149
- you have to throw the football, all right?
- Okay.

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.068
Draw your arm back. There you go.

01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:34.905
Shoulder to your target. Right.
Okay, now step forward.

01:05:34.989 --> 01:05:37.366
Come on we're not marching. One foot.

01:05:37.491 --> 01:05:40.327
- Okay.
- You're fine. Ready? There you go.

01:05:40.619 --> 01:05:41.996
Draw the ball over your ear...

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:45.249
and when you throw it, let it roll
right off your fingers, all right?

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:47.543
Okay.

01:05:47.918 --> 01:05:49.378
Come on, throw it.

01:05:55.301 --> 01:05:57.094
See? I taught you something. What?

01:05:57.177 --> 01:05:59.638
So every time I throw it,
you're gonna run and go get it?

01:05:59.763 --> 01:06:01.473
That's generally how it works.

01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:03.392
Like playing fetch with my dog.

01:06:03.517 --> 01:06:07.271
- Yeah, except I don't lick my own balls.
- You would if you could.

01:06:07.646 --> 01:06:08.647
Oh, yeah.

01:06:10.316 --> 01:06:11.483
Okay, again.

01:06:12.276 --> 01:06:13.444
Right here.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.448
Look, that one looks like a bunny.

01:06:17.781 --> 01:06:19.658
No, it doesn't.

01:06:21.035 --> 01:06:23.078
Maybe a bunny with one nut.

01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:26.081
- No, that's its tail.
- Whatever you say.

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:32.546
- You think we'll win this thing?
- Hell, yeah, we will.

01:06:32.671 --> 01:06:36.967
- If you write in a bagpipe part.
- Oh, God, I'll never make that mistake again.

01:06:37.051 --> 01:06:40.054
- What?
- The eighth grade recital.

01:06:41.138 --> 01:06:43.599
You made me write in a part for you.

01:06:45.893 --> 01:06:47.853
You wore your kilt.

01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:51.690
Yeah, Steve showed up with his friends.

01:06:52.358 --> 01:06:54.568
They gave me so much shit for that.

01:06:54.902 --> 01:06:57.279
I didn't come out of my room for days.

01:06:57.571 --> 01:07:00.741
You made it up to him
by stealing all my underwear...

01:07:00.866 --> 01:07:03.244
so you could run them up the flagpole.

01:07:04.203 --> 01:07:05.996
Including my training bras.

01:07:09.124 --> 01:07:11.752
Okay, since we're having
some big fucking Oprah moment here...

01:07:11.835 --> 01:07:13.879
I'm sorry about your underwear.

01:07:14.004 --> 01:07:15.631
And the diary.

01:07:18.384 --> 01:07:20.344
And all that other shit, too.

01:08:00.634 --> 01:08:01.719
That's it.

01:08:02.303 --> 01:08:05.180
- You started it.
- This is gonna get me that scholarship.

01:08:05.264 --> 01:08:06.265
What?

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:09.059
I've got to go write this down
before I forget.

01:08:10.936 --> 01:08:12.313
Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:08:14.148 --> 01:08:16.191
Could we do this again tomorrow night?

01:08:16.274 --> 01:08:19.111
Yeah, sure. I'll see you here at sunset.

01:08:19.653 --> 01:08:20.988
Hey.

01:08:21.947 --> 01:08:24.408
Should I bring that Picardo thing?

01:08:24.491 --> 01:08:26.702
Okay, I'll do a solo for you.

01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:38.631
- What's up, Ernie?
- Hey.

01:08:57.649 --> 01:08:59.609
It was that fugly nurse again.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.542
Oh, my God.

01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:18.002
Matt Stifler?

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:23.384
- Holy shit, look at you.
- Arrianna, what are you doing here?

01:09:23.509 --> 01:09:26.845
We practice our routine with the band.
What are you doing here?

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:29.305
I had to come. The school made me.

01:09:30.307 --> 01:09:33.727
- Does anybody know about this yet?
- Oh, they do now.

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:37.939
Hey, come on, no pictures.
What're you, the papa-tit-zzy?

01:09:38.023 --> 01:09:39.733
- Holy shit, this is so hilarious.
- Smile.

01:09:39.858 --> 01:09:43.696
Ladies. No time for fraternizing.

01:09:44.697 --> 01:09:48.783
Get the bags.
Guess I'll see you around, bandee.

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:53.205
What a dork.
I'm going to email this to everybody.

01:10:15.561 --> 01:10:18.314
Girls, that was great. Percussion, take five.

01:10:18.439 --> 01:10:20.149
Horns, we've got to work on intonation.

01:10:20.274 --> 01:10:22.901
The final performance is tomorrow,
you guys.

01:10:23.736 --> 01:10:25.529
They're so lame.

01:10:26.572 --> 01:10:28.949
You play the triangle. How cute.

01:10:29.783 --> 01:10:32.953
No, I don't. Look, I told you...

01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:34.955
- I had to...
- I gotta go.

01:10:35.039 --> 01:10:38.375
- I don't socialize with bandees.
- I'm not a fucking bandee.

01:10:38.751 --> 01:10:42.421
I'm not. Look.
I've just been acting like a geek.

01:10:42.713 --> 01:10:45.674
I've been playing them
so I could get them on hidden video.

01:10:45.758 --> 01:10:49.261
I've been secretly videotaping them
doing all this crazy shit.

01:10:50.262 --> 01:10:53.265
- Really?
- Yeah, I could show you.

01:10:55.893 --> 01:10:58.187
Okay, come by after dinner.

01:10:58.729 --> 01:11:01.357
I'll leave my pompoms
in the window for you.

01:11:34.848 --> 01:11:37.559
- You're late.
- Yeah, no shit. Open the window.

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.773
Hold on. Be careful with it.

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:55.160
All right, one condition
before I show you the fruits of my labors.

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.412
What's that?

01:11:56.787 --> 01:11:59.623
I want that picture
on that camera phone erased.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.346
Nobody at school hears
about the triangle or the beanie.

01:12:14.471 --> 01:12:17.099
I don't want anybody
to think I'm a dorky-ass bandee.

01:12:17.182 --> 01:12:18.976
Fine. Like, now can we get on with it?

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:22.521
As soon as you get rid of that picture
of me on your phone.

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:39.788
- Are you going into town?
- Not tonight. I'm too tired.

01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:42.499
Besides, they're much hotter here.

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:45.502
I know. It's a great crop this year.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:04.229
- There. Done deal.
- Now can we see the video?

01:13:05.105 --> 01:13:06.732
Stiffmeister Productions...

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:10.402
in association with
its talented new director, Matthew Stifler...

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.446
is happy to premier the unedited...

01:13:12.571 --> 01:13:17.034
unfiltered, and un-fucking-believable
Bandeez Gone Wild.

01:13:18.369 --> 01:13:19.536
Oh, yeah.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:27.628
- Oh, my God.
- That is unbelievable.

01:13:50.276 --> 01:13:52.569
- You're kidding me, right?
- That's great.

01:13:54.071 --> 01:13:57.241
Danielle likes Jimmy,
but she's like a foot taller than him.

01:13:57.324 --> 01:13:58.784
And wait till you hear this.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.412
Sheree slept with that big Oscar guy,
the drummer.

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:03.038
Said he was amazing.

01:14:03.622 --> 01:14:06.792
I hooked up with Brandon once.
Some drummer. He has...

01:14:06.917 --> 01:14:08.711
no rhythm,
and he can't even bang very long.

01:14:08.919 --> 01:14:10.713
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

01:14:10.796 --> 01:14:14.967
Yeah, he's a preemie. I'm not talking
about the day he was born, either.

01:14:16.844 --> 01:14:19.597
Can you get my back?
I think I got a little bit of sun today?

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.681
Sure.

01:14:20.931 --> 01:14:23.851
Get this. He has one ball.

01:14:24.435 --> 01:14:26.729
- No way.
- One ball.

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:30.816
Yeah, that why he carries that big stick
around everywhere.

01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:32.985
It's got his other ball on top.

01:14:37.448 --> 01:14:39.241
Shit, shit, oh, shit.

01:14:42.494 --> 01:14:43.954
What is that thing?

01:14:58.052 --> 01:14:59.386
Let's kill it.

01:15:00.804 --> 01:15:01.972
- Where'd he go?
- There he is.

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.182
Look out.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:45.015
This is going into the lake.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.560
No one's gonna know
about your little video.

01:15:48.686 --> 01:15:51.313
'Cause the shit you got us doing on tape...

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.030
So we got a contest to win tomorrow.
And I don't want to see you.

01:16:00.406 --> 01:16:01.574
Understand?

01:16:07.705 --> 01:16:09.123
Did you help him?

01:16:34.106 --> 01:16:35.733
With East Great Falls
in the lead...

01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:38.611
Beechwood has to win
the Band Camp Playoffs.

01:16:38.736 --> 01:16:40.946
Direct yourselves to the marching field
in one hour.

01:16:42.406 --> 01:16:45.743
Now, Dr. Choi, Brandon Vandecamp
from Beechwood...

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:48.162
is our best musician by far...

01:16:48.245 --> 01:16:53.208
and his father, Landon,
is our best donor, also by far.

01:16:54.168 --> 01:16:58.422
Robards needs talented musicians
as much as we need talented donors.

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:07.222
Ipecac.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.770
- So how's it going? Are you having fun?
- It's okay.

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:20.444
How about some Ipecac, Vande-cooch?

01:17:23.364 --> 01:17:27.201
This herbal fucking extract will help you
Beechwood fief play in tune, huh?

01:17:28.786 --> 01:17:29.787
Shit.

01:17:39.296 --> 01:17:41.674
I told you
I don't want to see you anymore, Stifler.

01:17:41.799 --> 01:17:43.926
Some day, you'll thank me, asshole.

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:51.475
- Orange?
- Again?

01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:54.061
- Damn.
- That orange shit is janky.

01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:56.021
I'm feeling grape, dawg.

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:02.861
I don't care how many times they
won. They're not getting the grape today.

01:18:02.987 --> 01:18:05.364
That's what I'm talking about.

01:18:07.032 --> 01:18:09.910
Your five-time defending
champion...

01:18:10.536 --> 01:18:12.329
Beechwood Academy.

01:18:44.445 --> 01:18:47.698
- They're tight.
- Yeah, they're better then ever this year.

01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:49.241
Okay, everybody.

01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:51.952
It's no surprise Beechwood is good.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:55.831
But this year is different.
This year, we can beat them.

01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:59.960
We've worked hard,
and we are good enough...

01:19:00.085 --> 01:19:02.630
and this is our time, so lets win the cup.

01:19:02.755 --> 01:19:04.715
Yeah!

01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:41.377
Beechwood Academy.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:44.964
Their music today was composed
by senior drum major...

01:19:45.089 --> 01:19:47.049
Brandon Vandecamp.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:48.300
Beat that.

01:19:51.303 --> 01:19:54.807
East Great Falls,
you may enter the field for competition.

01:20:12.157 --> 01:20:15.327
- Band 10 hut. One, two, ready.
- Shit.

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:16.954
Leesy, wait, no.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:19.123
No. Wait.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.719
You know, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.

01:20:31.844 --> 01:20:33.971
Not my shoes. Here we go.

01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:39.935
Stifler!

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.997
You know, you're like
your brother, Steve.

01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:03.709
And I don't think those are the shoes
you should be so eager to fill.

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:06.921
You know, the people
Steve thought were his friends...

01:21:07.046 --> 01:21:09.673
- really didn't like him very much.
- What?

01:21:09.757 --> 01:21:11.216
But I think you're different.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:15.512
I think people want to like you, Matt.
You just make it really hard.

01:21:29.902 --> 01:21:33.739
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
When you're a loser.

01:21:40.329 --> 01:21:44.625
Mr. Levenstein reports
that there were a few incidents...

01:21:44.708 --> 01:21:45.960
at camp.

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.963
But he also says that...

01:21:49.129 --> 01:21:52.883
you bonded with the band briefly.

01:21:56.929 --> 01:22:01.141
When school starts,
you're going to be on a very short leash.

01:22:01.392 --> 01:22:05.145
Remember, the Shermanator sees it all.

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:07.773
Be gone.

01:22:12.736 --> 01:22:14.947
Did everybody hate my brother?

01:22:26.292 --> 01:22:29.878
August 21, 2005.

01:22:30.504 --> 01:22:32.881
Some progress made with Stiffy Junior.

01:22:33.299 --> 01:22:35.759
Behavior modification evident.

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:38.929
Will continue to monitor.

01:22:39.597 --> 01:22:41.807
Shermanator out.

01:22:52.985 --> 01:22:55.446
A little "Double-D Sheree" action.

01:23:00.034 --> 01:23:01.911
Little bit of Dr. Robot.

01:23:03.746 --> 01:23:05.205
Crazy fucker.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.775
Hey, Stifler, where's your instrument?

01:24:14.858 --> 01:24:16.026
Dude, you're in the wrong uniform.

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.946
Screw them, dude. They're gonna freak out
when they see the video.

01:24:19.029 --> 01:24:21.240
Look, we thought that if we had
an advance screening...

01:24:21.323 --> 01:24:23.367
then everyone would see
that you're not really a dork.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:25.869
I can't. It's gone.

01:24:26.912 --> 01:24:30.082
- What?
- The video, man, I deleted it.

01:24:31.083 --> 01:24:32.084
Why?

01:24:33.043 --> 01:24:35.713
Guess little bro's quitting
the family business.

01:24:35.796 --> 01:24:37.298
Are you kidding me?

01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:42.720
He went fucking bandee on us.

01:24:59.153 --> 01:25:00.696
Hey, what's up, guys?

01:25:01.488 --> 01:25:03.449
You a dead man, motherfucker.

01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:06.201
- You, too, little man.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:25:06.577 --> 01:25:10.414
Dude, the purple puke was an accident.
Somebody switched the coolers.

01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:17.379
Hey, that orange shit is janky, yo.

01:25:18.088 --> 01:25:22.885
Chloe, we never saw Elyse,
you know, naked.

01:25:23.677 --> 01:25:25.638
Matt turned off the computer.

01:25:26.513 --> 01:25:29.058
So we're just supposed to forgive him now?

01:25:30.184 --> 01:25:32.895
- He's still an asshole.
- You're right.

01:25:33.896 --> 01:25:35.230
I am an asshole.

01:25:35.648 --> 01:25:37.858
I can't take back spying on you...

01:25:37.983 --> 01:25:40.361
and I can't win that Bandee Cup thing.

01:25:40.486 --> 01:25:43.364
But I can help someone
get what she deserves.

01:25:44.198 --> 01:25:46.325
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:49.119
Just help me help Elyse.

01:26:00.089 --> 01:26:02.549
- I got the number.
- Go ahead.

01:26:02.633 --> 01:26:06.136
555-0171.

01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:10.933
He shouldn't have been dumping Ipecac
in anyone's cooler.

01:26:11.016 --> 01:26:12.810
We could've won on our own.

01:26:15.145 --> 01:26:19.441
I don't even care that he saw me on camera.
Well, I mean I do, but...

01:26:20.526 --> 01:26:22.736
Honey, this just came for you.

01:26:26.532 --> 01:26:27.992
It's from Robards.

01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:30.703
What's it say?

01:26:32.496 --> 01:26:35.040
Dr. Choi wants to meet with me?

01:26:52.933 --> 01:26:54.893
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26:55.144 --> 01:26:57.021
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:26:58.731 --> 01:26:59.815
Bye.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.417
Hi. Elyse Houston.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:22.421
I have an appointment with Dr. Choi.

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:27.092
- You're not in the book.
- No, there must be some mistake. See...

01:27:29.053 --> 01:27:30.429
I have a letter.

01:27:35.935 --> 01:27:37.811
This letter is, well...

01:27:38.604 --> 01:27:39.772
It's a fake.

01:27:40.314 --> 01:27:43.233
- This is not Dr. Choi's signature.
- What?

01:27:56.455 --> 01:27:57.539
Stifler.

01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:03.587
You son of a bitch.

01:28:05.297 --> 01:28:09.677
What? It wasn't enough
for you to humiliate me at Band Camp?

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.429
Now you have to set me up here?

01:28:32.866 --> 01:28:34.577
What's going on here?

01:28:36.036 --> 01:28:37.496
This is my band.

01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:39.832
And that's her music.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:39.141
Well...

01:29:39.767 --> 01:29:43.437
I've certainly seen some interesting attempts
to gain admission...

01:29:44.146 --> 01:29:45.773
but this is a first.

01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:51.528
Excellent audition, Miss. Houston.
Let's go discuss that scholarship.

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:54.448
I thought Brandon won.

01:29:54.573 --> 01:29:57.910
No, Mr. Vandecamp
was disqualified for plagiarism.

01:29:57.993 --> 01:29:59.078
All right.

01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:03.374
That's what I'm talking about, yo.

01:30:07.544 --> 01:30:09.922
Oh, my God, you guys, that was amazing.

01:30:10.506 --> 01:30:14.551
- Thank you so much.
- Thank him. It was his idea.

01:30:14.635 --> 01:30:15.636
Word.

01:30:18.472 --> 01:30:22.059
- You planned all this?
- With some friends.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.272
Come here.

01:30:30.943 --> 01:30:33.320
Oh, I believe this is yours.

01:30:34.738 --> 01:30:35.906
You know...

01:30:36.615 --> 01:30:40.661
Picardo is a brand of piccolo.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.914
You really are an asshole sometimes...

01:30:44.373 --> 01:30:45.374
Stiffy.

01:34:06.742 --> 01:34:08.535
Man, change the channel, yo.

01:34:08.744 --> 01:34:11.747
Hook a brother up with some mad beats.

01:34:12.039 --> 01:34:13.666
Will you cut that out?

01:34:14.208 --> 01:34:16.335
Your name is James Hi Ping Chong.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:18.087
Your dad owns a Chinese restaurant.
