00:08.029 --> 00:08.997
Hi.

00:09.031 --> 00:10.498
Nora, hi.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.832
Hi.

00:11.867 --> 00:14.835
God. I didn't even know mom was in town.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.837
Did... did you know she was in town?

00:16.872 --> 00:20.208
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did. She was visiting Eunice.
- She called you?

00:20.242 --> 00:22.210
- Nora, I called her.
- All right.

00:22.244 --> 00:24.712
The point is that...
that she's doing great.

00:24.746 --> 00:27.916
I mean, it's a miracle that
it's only a sprained ankle.

00:29.451 --> 00:32.186
What the hell is she doing
with her hair these days?

00:32.220 --> 00:34.355
Maybe she changed salons
or her girl moved away.

00:34.390 --> 00:37.025
- I remember her hair being... you know something?
- I don't know who you are.

00:37.059 --> 00:41.029
Your mother takes to wandering
the streets, she gets hit by a bus,

00:41.063 --> 00:44.332
- and you talk about is who's doing her hair?
- Oh, hospitals make me anxious.

00:45.867 --> 00:48.236
Hospitals or mom?

00:48.270 --> 00:50.504
Both.

00:51.974 --> 00:53.441
Mr. Holden.

00:53.475 --> 00:55.509
Oh, Dr. Lewis, hi.

00:55.544 --> 00:57.511
This is my sister Nora. Hi.

00:57.546 --> 00:59.513
Hi. Your mother's doing fine.

00:59.548 --> 01:02.116
- Can you tell us what happened?
- We don't have much to go on.

01:02.151 --> 01:04.117
It wasn't until an hour or so ago

01:04.153 --> 01:06.120
that she was speaking coherently.

01:06.155 --> 01:10.724
Really? Uh, uh, c... can you... tell us a
little bit more about this disorientation?

01:10.759 --> 01:13.727
Tell me, how has she been?
Has she seemed confused?

01:13.762 --> 01:16.564
Well, she would call me and,
uh, with questions about things

01:16.598 --> 01:19.400
that I thought she should've
known the answer to.

01:19.435 --> 01:22.470
- And actually, the truth is, we both live here.
- She... she lives in New Mexico...

01:22.504 --> 01:25.139
- Alone.
- Well, that's gonna have to change.

01:25.174 --> 01:27.141
Disorientation like this is
a serious problem. It, uh...

01:27.176 --> 01:29.877
she's a danger to herself.
She's a danger to others.

01:29.911 --> 01:32.380
God forbid, she has one of these episodes,

01:32.414 --> 01:35.549
- she gets behind the wheel of a car...
- All right, all right. Okay, okay, okay.

01:35.584 --> 01:37.718
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- So what you're saying is that

01:37.752 --> 01:40.488
we should either send her to a home

01:40.522 --> 01:44.725
or, um... a... a... a live-in nurse.

01:44.759 --> 01:47.228
- I recommend 24-hour care.
- Oh, my God.

01:47.262 --> 01:49.763
What that looks like is
up to you and your mother,

01:49.798 --> 01:51.765
but I will say this... it may be more

01:51.800 --> 01:54.135
than either of you want
to take on by yourselves.

01:54.169 --> 01:57.138
- But I cannot release her until I know what your plan is.
- Okay.

01:57.172 --> 01:58.639
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:58.673 --> 02:00.141
Okay. Just take your time.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.781
So who gets to tell her?

02:13.955 --> 02:15.656
Robert.

02:15.690 --> 02:17.658
Robert. Robert, wake up. Wake up.

02:17.692 --> 02:20.694
- Hey, hey, what is it? Is it Evan?
- Oh, no. Evan is fine. Evan is asleep.

02:20.729 --> 02:22.997
But you are not gonna
believe this. What time is it?

02:23.032 --> 02:24.999
- It started. It...
- What are you doing up?

02:25.034 --> 02:27.201
I have a fund-raiser in Anaheim at 8:00.

02:27.236 --> 02:30.204
Do you not remember anything?
I mean, come on, Robert.

02:30.239 --> 02:32.206
Get with the program and read this.

02:32.241 --> 02:34.308
"Too sick to serve"...
all about my cancer,

02:34.343 --> 02:36.377
all about your heart attack.

02:36.412 --> 02:39.080
And they use the word "hubris" a lot.

02:39.114 --> 02:41.149
Bummer.

02:41.183 --> 02:44.018
Did you... did you just say "bummer"?

02:44.053 --> 02:48.523
Robert, this is exactly the kind of
thinking that just cost you a job.

02:48.557 --> 02:50.691
- Yeah, right?
- Carver hit a walk-off in extra innings.

02:50.725 --> 02:54.328
- I shouldn't have turned that game off.
- You're... you're talking about baseball?

02:54.363 --> 02:56.364
Honey, honey, this is serious.

02:56.398 --> 02:59.434
- Well, what do you want to do about it?
- Oh, well, I can think of a couple of things

02:59.468 --> 03:01.436
that I would like to do about it.

03:01.470 --> 03:03.737
Robert, why are you
taking this lying down?

03:03.772 --> 03:05.739
Because it's 5:30 in the morning.

03:05.774 --> 03:07.908
Kitty... just let this go.

03:07.943 --> 03:10.344
That's it?

03:10.379 --> 03:13.381
That, and I've gotta have
more faith in the team.

03:34.970 --> 03:37.705
Hey, what are you doing
awake? It's still dark outside?

03:37.739 --> 03:39.707
Okay, so when you think of Robert

03:39.741 --> 03:42.376
and you think of me, do
you think about death?

03:42.411 --> 03:44.712
- Why? What happened?
- Oh, you know, the blogs are just calling us

03:44.746 --> 03:46.780
"the catastrophe couple of California."

03:46.815 --> 03:48.782
And you want to hear the weirdest part?

03:48.817 --> 03:51.486
Robert is flatlining.
He's not even taking it in.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.254
He's not even reacting.
He's pretending that

03:53.288 --> 03:56.157
- he's concerned about the baseball scores.
- That doesn't sound like Robert.

03:56.191 --> 03:58.126
Thank you. I mean, Robert just lost a job

03:58.160 --> 03:59.827
because of this kind of discrimination.

03:59.861 --> 04:01.829
I mean, you can't not hire somebody

04:01.863 --> 04:03.331
because they have heart surgery.

04:03.365 --> 04:05.733
- Look at Dick Cheney.
- Ah, Dick Cheney.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.968
There's a reason I should
move to France with Luc.

04:08.003 --> 04:10.505
- Why don't you and Luc just get married?
- Kitty, I've been through this.

04:10.539 --> 04:13.608
I am not gonna let Luc's visa
be a reason I get remarried.

04:13.642 --> 04:16.611
- So have you made any more appeals?
- Are you kidding me? We've done everything we can.

04:16.644 --> 04:19.012
He's even in a lottery for a green card.

04:19.047 --> 04:21.749
- I've written letters, e-mails. I've left messages.
- Okay.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.485
- God knows if they ever get them.
- Okay, Sarah, easy does it. It's all gonna work out.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.787
You and Luc are completely
committed to each other.

04:26.821 --> 04:29.790
- I mean, he's leaving his stuff there, right?
- Which, when this doesn't work,

04:29.824 --> 04:33.027
- I'll just have to ship all the way back to France.
- Sarah, listen, you guys are gonna visit each other.

04:33.061 --> 04:35.029
It's gonna be... it's gonna be great.

04:35.063 --> 04:36.464
Visit? Come on, Kitty.

04:36.498 --> 04:38.466
Big whoop. You know as well as I do

04:38.500 --> 04:40.668
that absence does not
make the heart grow fonder.

04:40.702 --> 04:42.703
It just makes you realize
that you can live your lives

04:42.737 --> 04:44.238
without each other.

04:44.273 --> 04:46.740
And I don't want to
live my life without him,

04:46.775 --> 04:49.743
and now I'm gonna cry again
all over my spreadsheets.

04:49.778 --> 04:52.480
You know I cried in
three meetings yesterday?

04:52.514 --> 04:55.049
One of them was to raise
capital at a merchant bank.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.751
Oh, maybe I just need to get my period.

04:57.786 --> 04:59.753
Oh, gosh. Hang on. It's Kevin.

04:59.788 --> 05:02.490
Hi. What are you doing up?

05:02.524 --> 05:05.259
- I couldn't sleep and I need some advice.
- Okay, well, be quick about it,

05:05.294 --> 05:07.428
because I've got Sarah on the other line.

05:07.462 --> 05:10.598
Okay, when you were pregnant,
what was your H.C.G. level?

05:10.632 --> 05:12.200
What? Kevin, I can't hear you?

05:12.234 --> 05:14.602
I have to be quiet. I promised
Scotty I wouldn't go online,

05:14.636 --> 05:16.604
but I can't stop reading these forums.

05:16.638 --> 05:19.106
- Your H.C.G. Level, what was it?
- Um, I don't know. I just peed on a stick.

05:19.140 --> 05:22.376
Ugh! Ours is 53. Michelle's
going for a second test today,

05:22.411 --> 05:24.378
but it has to be double.

05:24.413 --> 05:25.107
You know, it would be so much
easier if we were straight?

05:25.108 --> 05:28.882
We'd just do a daily boob check
and see if she was pregnant or not.

05:28.917 --> 05:32.553
Oh, my God.

05:32.588 --> 05:34.388
- That's it.
- What's it?

05:34.456 --> 05:36.257
I gotta go. Wait...

05:36.291 --> 05:38.092
Sarah...

05:38.126 --> 05:41.629
Did you just tell me that, um,
you haven't gotten your period yet?

05:41.663 --> 05:43.631
No. And it's not helping things.

05:43.665 --> 05:46.500
Right. Because you know what?
You and I are on the same cycle,

05:46.535 --> 05:49.103
and I got mine, like, a week
and a half ago, so you are late.

05:49.137 --> 05:51.839
- You are very, very late.
- Really?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.874
Yeah. You haven't been this emotional

05:53.908 --> 05:56.344
- since you were pregnant with Cooper.
- Kitty, the love of my life

05:56.378 --> 05:58.846
is moving to the other side of the world.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.348
Besides, come on, I'm 43.

06:00.382 --> 06:02.350
I'm more likely to be perimenopausal

06:02.384 --> 06:04.985
- than I am to be pregnant.
- Oh, please. You know what?

06:05.019 --> 06:06.987
People get pregnant in
their 40s all the time.

06:07.021 --> 06:08.989
Well, not me... not me,
because I happen to be

06:09.023 --> 06:12.360
- part of the catastrophe couple, but you...
- Kitty, I'm not having this conversation.

06:12.394 --> 06:14.362
Oh, my God. This is gonna be so much fun.

06:14.396 --> 06:16.096
This is perfect.

06:16.131 --> 06:19.367
- This is... Evan's gonna have a new little playmate. It's...
- Okay. Good-bye.

06:19.401 --> 06:22.002
Hello? Sarah!

06:30.245 --> 06:32.713
If you just called Michelle at this hour

06:32.747 --> 06:34.715
to have her assess the tenderness

06:34.749 --> 06:37.918
- of her breasts again, I'm gonna kill you.
- I'm not even on the phone.

06:37.953 --> 06:39.954
You are googling H.C.G.
levels, aren't you?

06:39.988 --> 06:45.359
Well, it's better than what most
people do at odd hours on a computer.

06:45.394 --> 06:48.362
Well, did you know 73% of
people 10 days post-transfer

06:48.397 --> 06:51.265
who get a 53 end up with a B.F.N.?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.468
- Big fat negative.
- Kevin.

06:53.502 --> 06:55.470
- What?
- You heard what the doctor said.

06:55.504 --> 06:57.305
We're supposed to stay off the Internet.

06:57.339 --> 06:59.173
Our situation is unique to us.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.109
Everybody's results
are gonna be different.

07:01.143 --> 07:05.246
- I heard the doctor.
- Okay. Well, then why don't you look up movie times?

07:05.280 --> 07:08.249
It'll take our mind off
things until Michelle calls.

07:08.283 --> 07:10.784
Okay, fine. What do you want to see?

07:10.819 --> 07:13.053
Oh.

07:13.088 --> 07:15.156
Want to go to a psychic?

07:15.190 --> 07:17.158
How's that gonna take things off our mind?

07:17.192 --> 07:19.827
What, y... you want to ask a
stranger if she thinks we're pregnant?

07:19.861 --> 07:21.829
No, but, you know, it'd be fun.

07:21.863 --> 07:23.797
Ms. Nadine... world renowned...

07:23.832 --> 07:25.666
Psychic to the stars.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.168
World renowned?

07:27.202 --> 07:28.936
Yeah.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.938
Why do you want to know the gory details?

07:30.972 --> 07:32.940
Because, mother, you could've been killed.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.309
Now we... we... we just want to
know what happened. That's all.

07:35.344 --> 07:36.844
Fine. I left Chicago...

07:36.878 --> 07:40.148
- Chicago?
- Oh, no, mother. This is Los Angeles.

07:40.182 --> 07:43.217
The show, you morons.
The musical "Chicago"?

07:43.252 --> 07:46.387
Eunice and I went with
her senior citizens group.

07:46.421 --> 07:52.393
Now if we could just please fill out
this damn form so that I can get home.

07:52.427 --> 07:55.396
Mom, the doctor said that
you couldn't remember anything

07:55.430 --> 07:58.132
about what happened, so...

07:58.167 --> 07:59.634
What's going on?

07:59.668 --> 08:01.636
Nothing, mommy. We're
worried about you. That's all.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.638
You should honestly try to call us

08:03.672 --> 08:05.739
when you're thinking of coming to town.

08:05.774 --> 08:09.143
- Well, Saul knew I was here.
- Well, only because he happened to call you.

08:09.178 --> 08:11.145
At least someone calls me.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.647
Yeah.

08:12.681 --> 08:15.216
We have to think about the future, mom.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.984
What about it?

08:17.018 --> 08:18.219
Nora.

08:22.391 --> 08:24.925
Mother, listen.

08:26.361 --> 08:31.932
The doctors... they feel that you
shouldn't be living by yourself any longer.

08:31.966 --> 08:33.933
Why, because I sprained my ankle?

08:33.967 --> 08:37.238
No, because apparently, you were in the middle
of the road and didn't even know it, mother.

08:37.272 --> 08:40.107
Th... they said that you
weren't yourself for hours,

08:40.140 --> 08:42.109
and they're worried that
this could happen again...

08:42.143 --> 08:46.380
I lose my way for a couple of
hours in a city I don't know,

08:46.415 --> 08:49.617
and you want to box me up
and send me to a nursing home?

08:49.651 --> 08:51.619
That's where this is headed, right?

08:51.653 --> 08:53.721
- Mom...
- Right?

08:53.755 --> 08:55.256
Mom, you need help.

08:56.725 --> 08:59.026
Fine, Sauly.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.395
I'll move in with you.

09:03.532 --> 09:05.566
I don't think so, mom.

09:05.601 --> 09:08.202
My... my house is small, I have work,

09:08.237 --> 09:11.105
and I... and I... I just don't
think you'd be happy there.

09:11.139 --> 09:13.441
Mother, you can live
with me. Please, mother.

09:13.475 --> 09:16.677
Please live with me. I'd like that.

09:16.712 --> 09:19.413
I would rather live in a nursing home.

09:21.550 --> 09:23.016
Well...

09:23.051 --> 09:28.122
Yes, I'm sorry you feel that way.

09:28.156 --> 09:31.091
But you're coming home with me.

09:43.238 --> 09:46.207
Hey, we got the bread maker
that we registered for.

09:46.241 --> 09:48.209
- The bread maker? Nice.
- Yeah.

09:48.243 --> 09:50.811
- Maybe we can have some bread parties.
- Sounds like a good time.

09:50.846 --> 09:53.414
Oh, Rebecca, where are we
gonna put all this stuff?

09:53.449 --> 09:57.685
Well... you know that little bungalow
above sunset that I fell in love with?

09:57.719 --> 10:00.254
The one you took a picture of
and is now your screen saver?

10:00.289 --> 10:03.924
Yes, that one. Um... it's for sale.

10:03.959 --> 10:06.827
I'm just sayin'.

10:06.862 --> 10:09.430
Yeah, I was thinking more along
the lines of extra shelving.

10:09.465 --> 10:11.932
Because maybe you
forgot, I'm flat broke...

10:11.967 --> 10:15.370
- And you just sunk millions into our family business.
- No, I know, I know, I know.

10:15.404 --> 10:17.705
I'm just fantasizing for a moment.

10:17.739 --> 10:19.207
We'll definitely get some shelves.

10:19.241 --> 10:21.075
What?

10:21.110 --> 10:25.546
Uh, a buddy in my unit in Iraq
was, uh, killed in Afghanistan.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.615
Oh, my God, Justin. I'm so sorry.

10:27.649 --> 10:29.384
The funeral's tomorrow.

10:29.418 --> 10:31.819
I... I should go.

10:31.853 --> 10:34.955
I didn't even know he was still in.

10:34.990 --> 10:37.458
- Okay, here we go.
- No, just don't help me so much.

10:37.493 --> 10:39.627
I'm just gonna get... I
just need a little support.

10:39.661 --> 10:41.629
- Just stop it. Stop it.
- I'm giving you a little support.

10:41.663 --> 10:44.165
Just hold... put your hand on
the railing. Okay. Here we go.

10:44.199 --> 10:46.867
Oh! Yes, come in.

10:46.902 --> 10:49.037
Hi.

10:49.071 --> 10:50.671
Hi. Are you okay?

10:50.705 --> 10:53.007
I'm fine. Aren't we, mother?

10:53.042 --> 10:56.077
Ma, what are you doing up there?

10:56.111 --> 10:57.845
Your sister left me here.

10:57.879 --> 10:59.347
- What?
- Oh, I...

10:59.381 --> 11:01.749
It's all right. It's
all right. I can do it.

11:01.783 --> 11:04.818
I'm fine. I've got it. I can do it alone.

11:04.853 --> 11:07.121
I'm just fine.

11:07.156 --> 11:09.123
Ooh.

11:12.494 --> 11:14.595
You okay?

11:14.629 --> 11:16.597
Yes, I'm fine.

11:16.631 --> 11:18.099
We have just taken

11:18.133 --> 11:20.201
too many unnecessary trips
up and down the stairs.

11:20.235 --> 11:22.270
This time she wanted her book.

11:22.304 --> 11:24.272
I said, "mother, I'll go get it for you."

11:24.306 --> 11:26.774
She said, "no, no, I don't
want you in my things."

11:26.808 --> 11:28.809
So there we went, up mount Everest again.

11:28.843 --> 11:32.213
- But I talked to Susan O'Malley from...
- From... from your cancer center.

11:32.247 --> 11:34.215
Yes, she's now the head of the cent...

11:34.249 --> 11:36.217
- Would you please slice this for me?
- Yep.

11:36.251 --> 11:38.586
Very thin. No, very, very thin.

11:38.620 --> 11:41.589
- I remember.
- So I talked to Susan, and she told me

11:41.623 --> 11:43.757
where I could get her a Walker.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.760
And she also told me that her
mother is living with her, too.

11:46.795 --> 11:49.263
Wow. So we now have
mah-jongg on the books...

11:49.298 --> 11:50.764
Nice. Every Friday.

11:50.799 --> 11:53.267
So you can just stop worrying
about this arrangement.

11:53.302 --> 11:55.103
We are flourishing.

11:55.137 --> 11:57.605
Great. I'm not gonna worry.

11:57.639 --> 11:59.807
What about you?

12:01.577 --> 12:04.345
What about me?

12:04.379 --> 12:09.317
Well, I mean, come on, this isn't
exactly company for the weekend.

12:09.351 --> 12:11.319
Nora, have you ever thought about

12:11.353 --> 12:13.020
what you're giving up here?

12:13.054 --> 12:15.022
You heard what the doctor said,

12:15.056 --> 12:17.791
that this could very easily
go downhill quickly from here,

12:17.826 --> 12:19.793
and then... then what have
you consigned yourself to,

12:19.828 --> 12:21.362
and... and why, for what?

12:21.396 --> 12:23.364
So you could have a second chance

12:23.398 --> 12:25.032
at a relationship with mother?

12:25.066 --> 12:26.767
What is this?

12:26.801 --> 12:28.769
God. What... are you worried about losing

12:28.803 --> 12:30.471
your favorite child status?

12:30.506 --> 12:32.039
Is that it?

12:32.073 --> 12:34.542
- Oh, come on.
- Saul, listen to me, you get a bigger apartment,

12:34.576 --> 12:37.145
and she can come live
with you. How's that?

12:37.179 --> 12:40.185
Give me a break. You know that's not the
reason that I can't have her live with me.

12:40.186 --> 12:44.885
And what would be the reason for me to tell
her at this point in my life that I'm gay?

12:44.919 --> 12:47.488
 It's the truth.

12:47.523 --> 12:49.524
- Nice. Nice.
- I'm gonna call the kids.

12:49.558 --> 12:52.826
I'm gonna tell 'em they have
to have dinner with us tonight.

12:52.861 --> 12:55.829
We... we have to, all of
us, get used to the idea

12:55.864 --> 12:57.831
that Ida's gonna be staying here,

12:57.866 --> 13:00.301
hopefully for a very, very long time.

13:05.374 --> 13:07.308
I'm seeing a journey.

13:07.342 --> 13:09.043
A voyage of some sort.

13:09.077 --> 13:12.446
Are these the stars you
referenced in your ad?

13:12.481 --> 13:14.948
Kevin. Well, I'm sorry.
I've never seen these people.

13:14.983 --> 13:18.852
- I'm sorry. You were saying something about a journey?
- Yes.

13:18.887 --> 13:22.089
It's not for you, but for someone close,

13:22.157 --> 13:25.125
- perhaps a family member...
- Oh, my God. 

13:25.160 --> 13:27.261
That's totally Luc. My
sister-in-law's boyfriend,

13:27.296 --> 13:29.830
visa issues... does that ring a bell?

13:29.864 --> 13:30.791
I think you just rang it for her.

13:30.794 --> 13:32.268
That would make sense,

13:33.903 --> 13:38.506
but before he leaves
something else is coming.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.075
Don't tell her.

13:41.109 --> 13:43.977
This thing I see coming...

13:48.450 --> 13:51.885
It's a big, dark cloud.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.855
I can't tell you what it is,

13:54.889 --> 13:58.826
but it's going to bring
turmoil and maybe... even smoke.

13:58.860 --> 14:02.196
Wh... smoke? I thought
psychics only brought good news.

14:02.231 --> 14:04.198
That's a fortune cookie.

14:04.233 --> 14:08.469
But for what it's worth,
I am sensing new life.

14:10.272 --> 14:12.940
- Like a baby?
- Oh!

14:12.974 --> 14:14.942
What? That's what we're here for.

14:14.976 --> 14:17.411
Well, now that I know what
it is, yes, it's a baby.

14:17.446 --> 14:20.047
- Kevin, did you hear that?
- Yeah. Yay.

14:25.687 --> 14:28.055
Oh, Allison.

14:28.089 --> 14:31.091
I was just about to get
you that sales report.

14:31.126 --> 14:33.160
No, actually, could I ask you a question?

14:33.194 --> 14:36.096
Do you remember that meeting last month

14:36.131 --> 14:39.099
where I kind of flipped out because...

14:39.134 --> 14:41.435
Because your nonfat
dry cap wasn't very dry?

14:41.470 --> 14:43.203
Yeah. P.M.S.

14:43.238 --> 14:45.806
Do you remember when that was exactly?

14:45.840 --> 14:49.009
- March 11th.
- Wow. You're good with dates.

14:49.043 --> 14:50.678
It... it was my birthday.

14:50.712 --> 14:53.748
Oh. Sorry.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.289
Oh, my God.

15:01.323 --> 15:03.190
Six weeks.

15:03.224 --> 15:05.192
I wish we could have lunch,

15:05.226 --> 15:07.227
but they've got me on
this ridiculous schedule,

15:07.262 --> 15:09.229
and I have to be back at the state
department first thing in the morning.

15:09.264 --> 15:11.231
No, no, that's okay.

15:11.266 --> 15:13.434
You know, it sounds worse
than the campaign trail.

15:13.468 --> 15:15.936
Hey, I hear you've got a
good shot at the primary.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.938
Oh, well, Ann, I need a favor.

15:17.972 --> 15:20.441
Well, if you're looking to
secure more R.N.C. funding,

15:20.475 --> 15:21.942
I've already targeted you...

15:21.976 --> 15:25.346
No, no, no, actually,
it's, um, it's about Robert.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.214
What about him?

15:27.248 --> 15:29.383
I'm guessing that you
know that he was tapped

15:29.418 --> 15:32.920
for a high-level appointment
concerning national security.

15:32.954 --> 15:35.423
And, uh, he... he went
through the whole process,

15:35.457 --> 15:38.726
and they practically told
him that he had the job,

15:38.760 --> 15:41.228
and then at the last minute,
they rejected him because of

15:41.262 --> 15:43.597
some leftover scar tissue
from his heart surgery and...

15:43.632 --> 15:44.932
Oh.

15:44.966 --> 15:46.934
- I...
- Right.

15:46.968 --> 15:48.536
Wait a minute.

15:48.570 --> 15:51.372
What... did you hear something different?

15:51.406 --> 15:53.374
No. If that's what Robert told you,

15:53.408 --> 15:55.976
then he's in the best position to know.

15:56.010 --> 15:59.347
Listen, if he is
interested in a think tank

15:59.381 --> 16:03.183
- or a seat on the board...
- Um, Ann, Ann, please don't change the subject.

16:03.218 --> 16:05.018
What... what is going on?

16:05.053 --> 16:08.055
Look, all I'm gonna say is
that there are plenty of people

16:08.089 --> 16:10.558
in worse health than Robert
at the highest levels.

16:10.592 --> 16:13.026
A little scar tissue isn't
usually a deal breaker.

16:13.061 --> 16:14.995
I'm sorry.

16:15.029 --> 16:18.031
I have a car waiting.

16:19.934 --> 16:21.402
You did this.

16:21.436 --> 16:23.771
You killed the job.
You had me blackballed.

16:23.805 --> 16:25.806
Look, if you'd taken that appointment,

16:25.841 --> 16:27.307
you'd have been gagged.

16:27.342 --> 16:30.110
You'd take an oath of silence
and never be able to help us.

16:30.144 --> 16:32.112
We couldn't let that happen.

16:32.146 --> 16:35.082
There are plenty of people
who could help you do this.

16:35.116 --> 16:37.317
You know you're the perfect candidate.

16:39.153 --> 16:42.122
Even if I wanted to, my
wife is running for senate.

16:42.156 --> 16:44.124
There's no way that
I'm gonna jeopardize...

16:44.158 --> 16:46.727
Oh, well, your loyalty is admirable.

16:46.762 --> 16:50.664
- Family is important, but your country needs you, Robert.
- My country?

16:50.699 --> 16:52.833
Yes. Your country.

16:55.970 --> 16:58.672
Joe, find someone else.

17:02.637 --> 17:05.606
200 bucks down the drain, and
I still don't feel distracted.

17:05.852 --> 17:08.944
No, but you should be relieved.
Kevin, we're totally pregnant.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.990
What, is that based on the
tenderness of my breasts?

17:10.991 --> 17:13.548
No, she was dead-on about a lot of things. Luc...

17:13.579 --> 17:16.882
- Yeah, 'cause you told her about Luc.
- No. She said "journey" first.

17:16.915 --> 17:19.483
Oh. And then there was that
whole thing about new life.

17:19.519 --> 17:23.954
Yeah, and could she have
been any more generic?

17:26.058 --> 17:28.527
Oh, my God.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.696
The wicked witch of the west is in town.

17:31.731 --> 17:34.699
- Who?
- Grandma. She's gonna be at mom's tonight.

17:34.734 --> 17:36.401
- Wait. Ida's here?
- Mm-hmm.

17:36.436 --> 17:38.403
Kevin, she's the dark force.

17:38.438 --> 17:41.372
- She's totally the dark force bringing turmoil.
- Ida's cranky, okay?

17:41.407 --> 17:43.408
A dark force? Kind of a stretch.

17:43.443 --> 17:45.410
All right, smoke... what was that about?

17:45.445 --> 17:48.914
Clouds. We could paint clouds
on the ceiling of the nursery.

17:48.948 --> 17:51.917
I don't think predictions count
if you make them come true.

17:51.951 --> 17:54.118
Plus, we don't have a nursery.

17:57.022 --> 17:59.658
Kevin, I just want to believe.

18:01.861 --> 18:03.829
Spin it, Paula. Here we go...

18:03.863 --> 18:05.296
So...

18:05.331 --> 18:07.298
Are you... are you all set here?

18:07.333 --> 18:08.834
All set.

18:08.868 --> 18:11.002
There's nothing else that you need?

18:11.036 --> 18:13.672
That's what is meant by "all set."

18:13.706 --> 18:16.608
Yeah.

18:16.642 --> 18:18.543
Okay.

18:18.578 --> 18:20.979
You know, mom, you... you
really could come with me.

18:21.013 --> 18:23.147
I... I'm just shopping for dinner,

18:23.182 --> 18:25.216
and it would be like old times.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.486
Remember when we used
to shop at Hannigan's

18:27.520 --> 18:30.288
and we used to sample all the candies?

18:30.322 --> 18:31.790
Nora, don't patronize me.

18:31.824 --> 18:34.459
If you're afraid that I'm
gonna wander out in the street

18:34.494 --> 18:36.461
and get hit by another bus, just say so.

18:36.496 --> 18:38.463
Mother, I really wasn't patronizing you.

18:38.498 --> 18:41.299
I thought it would be
nice to have your company,

18:41.333 --> 18:44.302
- and we could spend some time together.
- And were you planning on
carrying me around the market

18:44.336 --> 18:47.639
or do I just sit in the car with Bingo?

18:49.842 --> 18:51.142
Bingo died.

18:51.176 --> 18:53.311
Oh.

18:53.345 --> 18:56.180
I had no idea.

18:56.215 --> 18:57.348
When?

18:57.383 --> 19:00.519
Just, uh, you know, a little while ago.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.020
Mother, listen to me.

19:02.054 --> 19:05.757
I would really, really
like you to come with me.

19:05.791 --> 19:07.759
I'd rather not miss my programs.

19:09.795 --> 19:13.164
So you... you... you
have my cell phone number.

19:13.198 --> 19:14.699
Okay.

19:14.734 --> 19:16.768
Oh, Nora.

19:16.802 --> 19:19.571
What... what time should I feed Bingo?

19:21.273 --> 19:24.242
Go shopping. It was a joke.

19:24.276 --> 19:27.078
Ha.

19:27.112 --> 19:29.981
Good.

19:36.556 --> 19:38.023
Hello?

19:38.057 --> 19:40.258
Oh...

19:41.928 --> 19:43.895
What... what... what's going on?

19:43.930 --> 19:47.098
Not much. Just thought
about emptying the trash.

19:47.132 --> 19:50.936
You know, um, actually, you
really should be getting ready,

19:50.970 --> 19:54.138
because we shouldn't be late
tonight. My grandma's coming.

19:54.173 --> 19:56.140
Did I tell you that? Have you met Ida?
Oh, don't be crazy. Of course you haven't.

19:56.175 --> 19:58.543
What am I talking about? What?

19:58.578 --> 20:01.546
You're so, so nervous.

20:01.581 --> 20:04.215
Yeah, a little bit. But
I'm holding it together.

20:04.249 --> 20:06.718
Babe, I... I'm gonna call you every night.

20:06.752 --> 20:08.720
Uh, it would be lunchtime for you.

20:08.754 --> 20:11.155
That way we can have lunch together.

20:11.190 --> 20:15.026
Luc, you know people do
move on with their lives.

20:15.061 --> 20:17.062
I'm worried we might get distracted.

20:17.096 --> 20:19.898
No, I'm not gonna get distracted.

20:19.932 --> 20:22.067
Do you remember when
we met the first time?

20:22.101 --> 20:24.368
You just appeared on my doorstep.

20:24.403 --> 20:27.572
Come on. We're meant to be together.

20:27.607 --> 20:32.911
Let's make the most of
the time we have left, huh?

20:36.048 --> 20:37.983
No. You know what?

20:38.017 --> 20:39.985
Sex is not always the answer.

20:40.019 --> 20:42.520
It can... it can have
very serious ramifications.

20:42.554 --> 20:45.023
- Wh... what?
- Come on, Luc, I shouldn't really

20:45.057 --> 20:48.526
have to explain to you...
the birds and the bees, kids.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.795
Kids.

20:53.298 --> 20:56.668
Wh... wh... what do you mean? Do...
do you want to have a baby?

20:56.702 --> 20:59.303
No.

20:59.338 --> 21:02.406
- No. Why? Do you?
- I don't know. I'm leaving in a day.

21:02.441 --> 21:04.909
- I don't think it's really practical...
- Exactly.

21:04.944 --> 21:07.078
You're leaving tomorrow.
It's not practical.

21:08.648 --> 21:10.615
All right. You should
go get ready for dinner.

21:10.650 --> 21:13.018
- I... I take out the trash.
- No, I'll get it.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.387
Got it.

21:16.421 --> 21:18.389
Let me take out the trash.

21:18.423 --> 21:20.959
Please. I'm here one more day.

21:20.993 --> 21:23.662
Could you please stop saying that?

21:23.696 --> 21:26.631
Let me take out the trash, then, yeah?

21:36.909 --> 21:39.778
Oh, God. Mom?

21:45.833 --> 21:47.467
Thank you so much.

21:47.502 --> 21:50.504
I promise I'll be careful next
time. Never let it happen again.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.441
Oh.

21:56.344 --> 21:58.945
You could have told them I did it.

21:58.979 --> 22:01.648
I don't think they
would have locked me up.

22:01.683 --> 22:03.650
No, mother, it's not your fault.

22:03.685 --> 22:06.653
O.... okay, you did turn
the burner on and walk away,

22:06.688 --> 22:08.988
but I should not leave
so much stuff around.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.625
This could have happened to anyone.

22:11.659 --> 22:14.127
Fine. We'll play it your way.

22:14.161 --> 22:15.662
Nora!

22:15.697 --> 22:17.197
Nora!

22:17.232 --> 22:20.200
Ah, jeez! Just don't say it.
Don't say it. Don't say it.

22:20.235 --> 22:23.203
We're fine. Everyone is fine.
We needn't change our plans.

22:23.238 --> 22:25.872
You couldn't call me? I
had to hear it from Sarah?

22:25.906 --> 22:28.375
Well, I knew you were coming
over for dinner tonight.

22:28.409 --> 22:31.745
- I mean, it's not like I'm keeping it a secret.
- Well, I'm just glad everything's okay

22:31.779 --> 22:34.748
and the house is still
standing. Mommy, you okay?

22:34.782 --> 22:37.050
I'm peachy. It was her fault.

22:38.819 --> 22:43.323
Oh, well... we're having pizza tonight.

22:46.461 --> 22:48.262
Was there a fire?

22:48.296 --> 22:50.397
Everybody's okay.

22:50.431 --> 22:52.266
Oh, wow.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.001
- It's true.
- Everybody's safe. It's fine.

22:55.035 --> 22:58.071
- So there was smoke.
- Can you smell that?

22:58.105 --> 22:59.806
- Mm-hmm.
- I love you.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.009
It's true. It's really true.

23:03.043 --> 23:05.011
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

23:05.045 --> 23:07.013
Is there something wrong
with the two of you?

23:07.047 --> 23:10.150
Uh. No. No, we're just
glad everyone's okay.

23:13.755 --> 23:15.822
Is there a chip or something?

23:15.856 --> 23:17.824
Oh, no. I'm just checking to see

23:17.858 --> 23:21.027
if it's the same company
that we registered for.

23:21.061 --> 23:23.863
- Um, I've been obsessed with dinnerware.
- We've received so many wedding gifts,

23:23.898 --> 23:27.467
- we have no idea where we're gonna put everything.
- Well, buy a house. You're married.

23:27.502 --> 23:31.305
- That's what people do.
- Well, actually, there is this... this one house that we love.

23:31.339 --> 23:35.008
- I didn't know med school paid so well.
- We're not actually in the market.

23:35.042 --> 23:37.544
Just, who knows?

23:37.578 --> 23:40.347
If things turn around with Ojai...

23:40.381 --> 23:43.617
Um, no, but I mean, we love our apartment.

23:43.651 --> 23:46.019
Don't get me wrong.
There's plenty of room.

23:46.053 --> 23:48.722
Our place is tiny, and we're
adding a baby to the mix.

23:48.756 --> 23:52.492
- You've heard? Did you hear something?
- No, no. I just meant at some point.

23:52.527 --> 23:54.695
- Yeah, and hopefully, the fates are with us.
- Yes.

23:54.729 --> 23:56.596
Sarah, you okay?

23:56.631 --> 23:59.599
Mm-hmm. I'm just, um...

23:59.634 --> 24:01.601
Gonna get wine for the table.

24:01.636 --> 24:03.704
Sarah, there's a bottle right here.

24:03.738 --> 24:05.271
Oh, Justin,

24:05.306 --> 24:08.942
I was so sorry to hear about Bingo.

24:08.976 --> 24:13.012
Your dog. Your mother mentioned
that he passed recently.

24:13.047 --> 24:18.918
Uh, grandma, Bingo... Vingo
passed away about 20 years ago.

24:18.953 --> 24:22.121
Well, I didn't say it was yesterday.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.858
No, you said "recently."

24:24.892 --> 24:26.727
Well...

24:26.761 --> 24:29.596
Why, so that I would feel better?

24:29.630 --> 24:32.566
Well, I don't know. Is
that such a bad thing?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.568
No, no, of course not, dear.

24:34.602 --> 24:36.570
It's one of the wonderful
things about you.

24:36.604 --> 24:39.038
- You're such a pleaser.
- Mom, come on.

24:39.073 --> 24:41.941
Like taking blame for
the fire that I caused.

24:41.976 --> 24:44.077
Mother, look, everyone is safe.

24:44.111 --> 24:46.913
No one got hurt. It doesn't
matter whose fault it was.

24:46.947 --> 24:50.450
Well, it matters to me, damn it.

24:52.587 --> 24:54.388
Hello?

24:54.422 --> 24:56.122
Kitty, come in here.

24:56.156 --> 24:57.824
Oh.

24:57.859 --> 25:01.862
- Well, did you take the test?
- No. I bought the test, but then Luc came home.

25:01.896 --> 25:04.130
I had to throw it in the trash.

25:04.164 --> 25:07.667
Wait a minute. Are you telling
me that Luc doesn't know?

25:07.702 --> 25:11.104
- Sarah, you have to tell him.
- Tell him what? What's there
to tell? There's nothing to tell.

25:11.138 --> 25:13.673
Even if there was, he's leaving tomorrow.

25:13.708 --> 25:16.342
I am here to tell you
that this is not something

25:16.377 --> 25:19.012
that you should be
keeping from your partner.

25:19.046 --> 25:21.014
You are in a committed relationship.

25:21.048 --> 25:23.016
You don't... you don't keep
secrets from each other.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.685
I mean, no wonder you think
the long-distance thing

25:25.720 --> 25:28.354
isn't gonna work. Okay,
I might be hormonal,

25:28.389 --> 25:31.991
but it feels like you're
being really mean to me.

25:32.026 --> 25:34.994
- He's French. I have two kids.
- I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not you, okay?

25:35.029 --> 25:36.996
It's not you. It's me. It's me.

25:37.031 --> 25:38.998
I... I went to see this
woman today... Ann Waterman...

25:39.033 --> 25:42.702
- To confront her about why Robert didn't get the job.
- You went to see Ann Waterman?

25:42.737 --> 25:45.204
Kevin! Have you been
eavesdropping outside that door?

25:45.239 --> 25:48.508
- No. Well, a little. Just at the end.
- Wait a minute. Did Robert ever tell you

25:48.543 --> 25:51.645
anything about some sort
of job in intelligence?

25:51.679 --> 25:55.715
- Oh, the job? The big secret job? God, yeah. What about it?
- I went to see Ann Waterman today,

25:55.750 --> 25:57.717
because I wanted to talk to her about

25:57.752 --> 25:59.719
how I thought it was discrimination

25:59.754 --> 26:01.922
that Robert didn't get the job
because of his heart surgery,

26:01.956 --> 26:04.223
- and she looked at me like I was crazy.
-  Meaning?

26:04.258 --> 26:06.526
Meaning that I think
there's another reason

26:06.561 --> 26:09.563
- why Robert didn't get the job.
- Oh, you think there's a scandal
that you don't know about?

26:09.597 --> 26:12.165
Kev, let's just turn the dial
down on the... on the drama queen.

26:12.199 --> 26:15.469
- Okay, well, maybe he was embarrassed.
- You know Robert. He doesn't get embarrassed.

26:15.503 --> 26:17.971
- He wasn't born with the ability to get...
- Kitty.

26:18.005 --> 26:20.640
- What?
- Can we not talk about birth, please?

26:20.675 --> 26:23.376
Right. Right. Sorry. Sorry. Um...

26:23.410 --> 26:25.579
Has Scotty said something to you two?

26:25.613 --> 26:28.081
About what?

26:28.115 --> 26:32.018
Oh, my God. Are you pregnant, too?

26:32.052 --> 26:34.320
What do you mean, "too"?
Who else is pregnant?

26:34.355 --> 26:36.189
I don't know. Kitty?

26:36.223 --> 26:38.191
- Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.
- Who's pregnant?

26:38.225 --> 26:41.194
- Nobody. I never said anybody was pregnant.
- No, you said "too."

26:41.228 --> 26:43.597
- "Too" implies somebody else is pregnant.
- Yeah.

26:43.631 --> 26:46.533
- It was... I meant "boo."
- So who's the first person? Kevin?

26:46.567 --> 26:49.603
What? Are you pregnant?

26:49.637 --> 26:53.006
Oh, we went to a psychic, and
she predicted a "new life."

26:53.040 --> 26:56.710
Oh. But maybe that new life isn't ours.

26:56.744 --> 27:01.014
Maybe it's one of yours.
So tell me, is it? Is it?

27:01.048 --> 27:03.349
Is one of you pregnant?

27:03.384 --> 27:06.019
Luc. H... hi.

27:06.053 --> 27:09.355
- So the birds and the bees...
you were... you were serious?
- It is you.

27:09.390 --> 27:12.425
No. Yes. Maybe. I don't know.

27:12.459 --> 27:14.761
- But it might be?
- That would be amazing.

27:14.795 --> 27:17.697
No, it's not amazing.
It's not amazing, Luc.

27:17.732 --> 27:20.366
You're leaving tomorrow.
And we were careful.

27:20.401 --> 27:24.137
- We were really, really careful. I thought we were.
- You thought you were being careful?

27:24.171 --> 27:26.573
- Kevin, what the hell is your problem?
- Hey, are we okay in here?

27:26.607 --> 27:28.708
No, we're not. The new life?

27:28.743 --> 27:31.110
- Yeah.
- It's her. It's Sarah.

27:31.145 --> 27:33.780
- What?
- She stole our baby.

27:33.814 --> 27:37.817
You're... uh, Kevin!

27:40.688 --> 27:42.756
Ma, you want some more salad?

27:42.790 --> 27:45.458
- Bye, mom! Bye, gram!
- Kevin!
- Wait!

27:45.492 --> 27:47.727
- What, is Kevin leaving?
- Yeah, it sounded like that.

27:47.762 --> 27:49.429
- Excuse me.
- W... what's going on?

27:49.463 --> 27:51.431
Uh, nothing. Um, uh,
thank you for the dinner.

27:51.465 --> 27:54.267
- We... we just really have to go.
- No, you guys aren't leaving, too.

27:54.301 --> 27:57.604
- Look, Justin's getting the ice cream.
- Yeah, the sitter... we, uh, we have to relieve her.

27:57.638 --> 28:00.173
I thought the kids were with
their father this weekend.

28:00.207 --> 28:03.509
- Right. Good night.
- Good night.

28:03.544 --> 28:06.412
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

28:06.447 --> 28:09.115
I honestly don't know where
that instinct comes from.

28:09.149 --> 28:11.417
What instinct is that, mother?

28:11.452 --> 28:14.287
The one that tells you that
you have to fix everything.

28:14.321 --> 28:17.523
Who knows what's going on out there?

28:17.558 --> 28:20.794
They're adults. If they
need you, they'll ask you.

28:20.828 --> 28:22.996
Come on, ma. It's perfectly understandable

28:23.030 --> 28:25.632
for Nora to want to find
out what's happening.

28:25.666 --> 28:28.635
I'm sorry, mother, if I don't
do things the way you did.

28:28.669 --> 28:31.638
I just want to be there
for my children, that's all.

28:31.672 --> 28:34.941
- You're right. We've always done things differently.
- Can we not do this now, please?

28:34.976 --> 28:37.677
No, we're going to do this now.

28:37.712 --> 28:41.214
Nora, I don't want to
live in this house with you

28:41.248 --> 28:44.651
for the next ten years of my life.

28:44.685 --> 28:48.187
There's a place called Fair Willows.

28:48.222 --> 28:51.124
- We've been over this.
- No, you have been over this.

28:51.158 --> 28:55.729
Allow me the dignity
to make my own choices.

28:55.763 --> 28:57.897
Allow me that,

28:57.932 --> 29:01.034
before it's too late.

29:08.707 --> 29:11.142
Please, please don't try and
get my hopes up again, okay?

29:11.176 --> 29:13.144
You should have just left me to my blogs

29:13.178 --> 29:15.279
and my "dreams of motherhood" forums

29:15.313 --> 29:17.281
full of ectopic pregnancies, B.F.Ns

29:17.315 --> 29:18.783
and people just acknowledging

29:18.817 --> 29:20.785
what a huge miracle it is to get pregnant.

29:20.819 --> 29:23.353
At least that way, I'd have been
able to manage my expectations

29:23.388 --> 29:26.356
- and wrap my head around the disappointment.
- No, you wouldn't have.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.358
Even if Michelle turns
out not to be pregnant,

29:28.393 --> 29:31.528
Ms. Nadine or no Ms. Nadine,
it's still going to hurt.

29:31.563 --> 29:35.232
- There's no way to soften that blow.
- I don't think I can handle it
without it being softened.

29:35.266 --> 29:38.235
Yes, you can, because I will be
right here with you. You know,

29:38.269 --> 29:42.039
maybe this is just a sign
that it's not meant to be.

29:42.074 --> 29:43.674
You're trying to soften again.

29:43.709 --> 29:46.977
If we really wanna be parents,

29:47.012 --> 29:48.979
maybe we could get a dog.

29:49.014 --> 29:51.448
I like dogs.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.257
Hey.

30:08.767 --> 30:11.869
Boy, for a woman who is
supposedly diminished,

30:11.903 --> 30:15.572
she certainly knows how to
turn it on when she wants to.

30:15.607 --> 30:19.009
She sure does.

30:19.044 --> 30:21.511
But she's right, Nora. She is.

30:21.546 --> 30:25.082
It's her choice how and where
she spends the rest of her life.

30:25.117 --> 30:28.585
She doesn't want to live here,

30:28.620 --> 30:30.254
with me.

30:30.288 --> 30:32.723
That's what this is about.

30:32.758 --> 30:35.692
I know that you want to
have a relationship with her,

30:35.727 --> 30:37.194
but you've tried.

30:37.229 --> 30:39.663
You've tried.

30:40.899 --> 30:42.066
Mm.

30:44.870 --> 30:46.137
Nora.

30:48.140 --> 30:51.108
But then I'll never have
a relationship with her

30:51.143 --> 30:52.777
like you do.

30:52.811 --> 30:55.279
What do I have with her? Tell me.

30:55.313 --> 30:56.781
I have a lie.

30:56.815 --> 30:59.316
The only reason you think
that I'm close with mother

30:59.350 --> 31:01.551
is because I don't fight her.

31:01.586 --> 31:03.720
I can't live honestly in front of her.

31:03.755 --> 31:06.257
I've never been able to. But you do.

31:06.291 --> 31:08.592
You're yourself.

31:08.626 --> 31:12.529
And I envy that, because that's
something I'll never have.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.066
Really?

31:16.101 --> 31:18.535
Yeah, really.

31:18.569 --> 31:20.470
Well...

31:20.505 --> 31:24.775
If I s...

31:24.810 --> 31:27.978
- If I send her off...
- When you send her off.

31:28.013 --> 31:30.147
- When I send her off...
- Right.

31:30.182 --> 31:33.150
We can't let this be a new
precedent in the family.

31:33.185 --> 31:35.252
Because I'm gonna live
with Kitty or with Sarah.

31:35.287 --> 31:37.254
Better yet, I'm living with Kevin.

31:37.289 --> 31:40.124
- No one's gonna ship me off.
- Okay.

31:40.158 --> 31:44.428
Okay, I'll have the family
bylaws revised on Monday...

31:44.462 --> 31:46.763
And I'll make sure it says that.

31:46.798 --> 31:48.465
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:52.170 --> 31:54.038
Hey.

31:54.072 --> 31:56.006
Hey.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.508
Looks like you and Evan had some fun.

31:58.543 --> 32:01.979
He is gonna be a drummer pretty soon.

32:02.013 --> 32:03.747
How was dinner?

32:03.781 --> 32:07.017
Uh, dinner. Dinner was fine.
You know, dinner with my family.

32:07.052 --> 32:09.253
You know how it is.

32:09.287 --> 32:12.689
Wait a second. You had Ida, Nora
and Saul all in the same room,

32:12.724 --> 32:15.993
so it must have been great so spill it.

32:16.027 --> 32:18.229
Well...

32:18.263 --> 32:21.198
I went to see Ann Waterman today.

32:21.233 --> 32:24.902
- Why would you do that?
- Because I think you're lying to me.

32:28.139 --> 32:31.108
- What exactly did Ann tell you?
- Nothing. She didn't tell me anything.

32:31.142 --> 32:34.144
But it was very clear that
she was hiding something,

32:34.179 --> 32:36.146
so I'm assuming you are, too.

32:38.183 --> 32:40.985
Look,

32:41.019 --> 32:43.287
someone intervened...

32:43.321 --> 32:45.389
And prevented me from getting the job.

32:45.423 --> 32:48.158
The heart attack was just an excuse.

32:48.193 --> 32:49.960
Who intervened?

32:49.995 --> 32:52.363
People. Powerful people.

32:52.397 --> 32:54.731
And you knew that they did this?

32:54.766 --> 32:56.767
Not until today. They lied to me, too.

32:56.801 --> 32:58.769
I don't understand. Who's "they"?

32:58.803 --> 33:01.571
- Who would want to prevent you from getting this job?
- I can't get into it.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.573
Oh, come on, Robert. I
am your wife. Remember?

33:03.608 --> 33:05.475
Remember we promised we weren't gonna keep

33:05.510 --> 33:07.577
any secrets from each
other? Well, here I am

33:07.612 --> 33:10.247
- in the middle of a campaign, and I want to know...
- Why is exactly why you cannot know...

33:10.282 --> 33:12.883
- Is something gonna come out all of a sudden...
- Anything about this.

33:12.918 --> 33:15.319
- Something that's gonna surprise me?
- You need to stay away from it.

33:15.353 --> 33:17.821
- Is there going to be an investigation?
- No.

33:17.855 --> 33:21.458
They want me to help
them with something...

33:21.492 --> 33:23.460
And having the job would prevent that.

33:23.494 --> 33:26.763
Look, it's not like
there aren't good motives

33:26.798 --> 33:29.733
behind what they're
doing. It's just that I...

33:29.767 --> 33:33.103
Am not sure that I
want to be a part of it.

33:33.138 --> 33:35.605
Well, you need to tell them
that. You need to tell them

33:35.640 --> 33:37.607
that you don't want anything to do with it

33:37.642 --> 33:39.609
and they should get somebody else.

33:39.644 --> 33:42.346
I did. I told them exactly that.

33:45.283 --> 33:47.617
I'll get him.

33:52.790 --> 33:56.193
- So you doing it?
- I should have had more to drink.

33:56.227 --> 33:59.796
- I was trying to avoid the wine.
- Uh, you know that, uh, women in France,

33:59.831 --> 34:01.832
uh, drink wine when they're pregnant.

34:01.866 --> 34:04.935
- Well, that explains a lot.
- I'm sorry, but...

34:04.970 --> 34:06.937
I just can't believe this.

34:06.972 --> 34:09.639
I... I didn't know I wanted a family.

34:13.078 --> 34:15.446
Well, I already have a family.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.514
I know you do. One that includes me.

34:18.549 --> 34:22.619
Sarah, that could be such a great thing.

34:22.652 --> 34:26.056
And like you said, the
distance is so hard.

34:26.123 --> 34:29.059
- But now we...
- But what?

34:29.094 --> 34:31.728
You said you thought
this would be no problem.

34:31.762 --> 34:33.364
I know.

34:33.398 --> 34:36.533
But the truth is, it
will be a little hard.

34:36.567 --> 34:39.835
People get busy, move
on with their own lives.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.838
What are you saying, Luc?

34:41.873 --> 34:45.309
You think we need a baby
to help keep us together?

34:45.342 --> 34:48.879
- What happened to all your optimism?
- Look, I'm nervous, too. But a baby...

34:48.913 --> 34:51.947
A baby will hold us together
no matter where we are.

34:51.983 --> 34:54.051
We'd be a family.

34:54.085 --> 34:56.453
That's what I really want for us.

35:04.429 --> 35:07.597
Well, I'm sorry to hear
that because it's negative.

35:07.632 --> 35:09.566
I'm not pregnant.

35:11.136 --> 35:14.071
It's such a shame it's
so UN-p.c to buy a dog.

35:14.105 --> 35:16.073
- Look at that goldendoodle.
- Oh, my God. So cute.

35:16.107 --> 35:18.075
Maybe we can rescue one.

35:18.109 --> 35:20.077
Well, I don't think
goldendoodles need rescuing.

35:20.111 --> 35:22.812
Hi, Michelle. Uh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

35:22.847 --> 35:25.815
Uh, before you say anything,
we just... we want you to know,

35:25.850 --> 35:29.319
we're so grateful for everything
you're going through for us,

35:29.354 --> 35:31.922
and no matter what happens,
there's no blame, there's no...

35:31.956 --> 35:34.525
- 461?
- 461?

35:34.559 --> 35:37.261
That's her H.C.G. level. She's pregnant.

35:37.295 --> 35:40.097
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're pregnant.
- We're pregnant. We're pregnant.

35:44.402 --> 35:46.836
Just enjoying the perks
of being without child.

35:46.871 --> 35:49.940
- Sarah, I was just, uh...
- Don't tell me that you were
trying to make me feel better

35:49.974 --> 35:52.109
about that, too, because
then I'll have to reevaluate

35:52.143 --> 35:54.111
everything you've ever said to me.

35:54.145 --> 35:56.113
Well, I wasn't. I was excited.

35:56.147 --> 35:59.316
This is not the first time I
thought I got someone pregnant.

35:59.350 --> 36:01.818
Not what I need to hear right now.

36:01.852 --> 36:04.821
But this is the first
time I felt the way I felt.

36:04.855 --> 36:08.024
It's because I'm in love with you, Sarah.

36:08.059 --> 36:10.894
And this is why it's gonna work.

36:10.928 --> 36:14.298
But neither of us actually
believe that 100%, do we?

36:14.332 --> 36:16.633
I'm moving 6,000 miles away.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.635
It's gonna be a big change, but...

36:18.669 --> 36:20.404
It's gonna suck.

36:20.438 --> 36:24.308
No, we're going in eyes wide-open.

36:24.342 --> 36:26.310
But this is what I want.

36:26.344 --> 36:27.811
You want this, right?

36:27.845 --> 36:29.580
Of course I do.

36:29.614 --> 36:32.882
So then we're gonna make it work.

36:35.286 --> 36:37.121
You're right. I'm sorry.

36:39.790 --> 36:42.259
We will.

36:58.281 --> 36:59.881
Hey.

36:59.916 --> 37:01.883
You really do come to all of these, huh?

37:01.918 --> 37:04.186
As much as I can.

37:04.220 --> 37:07.622
He seems like he was a hell of a soldier.

37:07.657 --> 37:10.292
He was.

37:10.326 --> 37:13.295
You know, since I've been back,
he's done three tours of duty.

37:13.329 --> 37:15.130
Three.

37:15.165 --> 37:21.736
Yeah, a place like this, sometimes it's
hard not to feel guilty for what you have.

37:21.771 --> 37:24.706
It just makes me wonder,
since I've been back,

37:24.740 --> 37:26.708
what the hell I've been doing, you know?

37:26.742 --> 37:29.044
Justin, you served
your country with honor.

37:29.079 --> 37:31.046
You're studying to be a doctor.

37:31.081 --> 37:34.116
But there are a shortage of
medics out there now, Robert.

37:35.952 --> 37:39.788
Sometimes I feel this call to
serve, you know, something bigger

37:39.822 --> 37:43.358
than... than my little
corner of the world, you know?

37:43.393 --> 37:44.793
Yeah.

37:46.929 --> 37:49.764
Yeah, I do know.

37:54.737 --> 37:56.838
Okay, we're almost set.

37:56.872 --> 37:59.575
I just have to find my damn cell phone.

37:59.609 --> 38:02.578
Oh, I spoke with the nicest
lady at Fair Willows, and she...

38:02.612 --> 38:06.047
Eunice, slow down.

38:06.082 --> 38:09.718
- What?
- It's a charter bus. They're
not gonna leave without us.

38:09.752 --> 38:12.721
And the show doesn't even start till 2:00.

38:12.755 --> 38:16.024
Mom, it's me, Nora.

38:16.058 --> 38:18.227
Nora.

38:18.261 --> 38:20.362
Yes. Thank you.

38:20.396 --> 38:21.863
My daughter.

38:21.897 --> 38:23.865
Oh, I gotta call her.

38:23.899 --> 38:27.736
If she knew that I was here in
California and didn't call her...

38:27.770 --> 38:30.739
though she's probably got
a million things going on...

38:30.773 --> 38:32.407
Always so busy.

38:32.442 --> 38:35.410
And I don't ever want to
become a burden to her.

38:37.213 --> 38:41.617
Well, maybe she's not so busy that
she wouldn't love to hear from you.

38:41.651 --> 38:43.785
Well, it... it's those children.

38:43.819 --> 38:48.390
They're fully grown, but they
still keep her on her toes.

38:48.424 --> 38:49.891
But...

38:49.925 --> 38:51.993
They're wonderful.

38:52.028 --> 38:55.096
How could they not be
with a mother like that?

39:30.366 --> 39:33.335
Baby names? When did you
have time to get these?

39:33.369 --> 39:34.836
Oh, a couple weeks ago.

39:34.870 --> 39:38.473
Look at you, Mr. Quietly Confident.

39:38.508 --> 39:40.175
I knew all along.

39:40.210 --> 39:43.312
Well, forget Ms. Nadine. Looks
like you found your calling.

39:43.346 --> 39:44.913
Sarah.

39:44.947 --> 39:47.816
Okay, well, you're all
packed, pretty sparingly.

39:49.452 --> 39:51.820
I... I... I won the lottery.

39:51.854 --> 39:53.988
You what?

39:54.023 --> 39:55.890
I won the lottery.

39:59.529 --> 40:02.531
- You got a green card.
- It just arrived.

40:02.565 --> 40:05.133
You got a green card.

40:10.906 --> 40:12.207
Ohh.

40:12.242 --> 40:13.542
Harmony Wandell.

40:13.576 --> 40:16.111
Augustus Walker.

40:16.145 --> 40:17.613
Hey, you know what?

40:17.647 --> 40:19.615
We're never gonna agree on a baby name?

40:19.649 --> 40:21.617
No, no. Ms. Nadine's predictions...

40:21.651 --> 40:23.118
There's one outstanding...

40:23.152 --> 40:26.087
You know, the one about a... 
a loved one making a journey.

40:26.122 --> 40:28.089
Well, it's gotta be your grandma.

40:28.124 --> 40:29.891
Oh, yeah. I guess.

40:46.142 --> 40:48.109
Okay, I've got everything, mom.

40:48.144 --> 40:50.779
Do you want to wear your
coat or shall I pack it?

40:50.813 --> 40:53.782
If I wanted to pack it,
Nora, I would have packed it.

40:53.816 --> 40:56.818
Use your head.

40:56.852 --> 40:59.688
Good point, mom.

40:59.722 --> 41:01.657
Good point.

41:13.235 --> 41:15.203
I'm glad to get your call, senator.

41:15.237 --> 41:18.139
- I'm wheels up in five. I don't have much time.
- I changed my mind.

41:18.174 --> 41:19.308
Why?

41:21.544 --> 41:24.513
I just started thinking that
maybe I should be worrying

41:24.547 --> 41:27.516
about something bigger
than my corner of the world.

41:27.550 --> 41:30.151
- Are you sure?
- I'm in.

41:30.186 --> 41:33.388
You've made the right decision.

41:33.423 --> 41:35.824
Let's hope so.
