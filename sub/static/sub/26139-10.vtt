00:01.369 --> 00:04.738
-(rock music playing, muted)
-(people chattering)

00:06.540 --> 00:08.576
ANNOUNCER: You're The Worst.
The final season.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.744
Premieres January on FXX.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.082
FX presents...

00:14.115 --> 00:16.950
American Horror Story:
Apocalypse.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.234
Can I help you?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.503
I'm here to visit the founders

00:35.536 --> 00:37.438
of this venerable institution--

00:37.471 --> 00:40.741
Mr. Mutt Nutter

00:40.774 --> 00:43.111
and Mr. Jeff Pfister.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.948
The fine security staff
downstairs were kind enough

00:47.981 --> 00:49.950
to give me directions
to the correct floor.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.520
The floor is the only thing
you have correct.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.923
You do not have an appointment,
nor are you carrying a package,

00:55.956 --> 00:57.925
so you don't have
any business here.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.528
Quite right.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.463
Your employers are fortunate
to have someone

01:02.496 --> 01:05.333
with your skills
guarding their privacy.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.936
I don't respond to flattery.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.938
Nor can you recognize sarcasm.

01:10.971 --> 01:14.074
You need to turn around
and go back the way you came.

01:14.108 --> 01:18.979
Mm. You need to take me
to your employers. Now.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.949
You might as well ask me
to explain your hair.

01:24.185 --> 01:27.155
How did you get past security
without an appointment?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.790
I did something like this.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.092
(reciting spell in Latin)

01:35.629 --> 01:39.200
My hair is an eternal mystery,
never to be fully understood.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.774
Purple is for royalty, dear,
not middle management.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.590
Did you put us
in Outpost number Two?

02:02.623 --> 02:05.426
Well, I thought if we had to do
any last-minute troubleshooting,

02:05.459 --> 02:07.195
all the brains
should be in one place.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.129
So while the world is burning,

02:09.163 --> 02:12.166
Johansson and Lawrence and
Theron are in the Bahamas...

02:12.200 --> 02:15.369
and we're in West Virginia
with Professor Michio Kaku.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.604
He's a brilliant guy.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.772
So was Einstein,
but if it's between him

02:18.806 --> 02:20.808
and Marilyn Monroe,
fuck the theory of relativity.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.611
I told ya, bro,
genetically superior caste,

02:23.644 --> 02:25.779
necessary but boring.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.015
Well, who's gonna be
in Outpost Three?

02:28.048 --> 02:29.817
'Cause Langdon
wants his robot there.

02:29.850 --> 02:33.120
What? He wants
the Battle Axe 9000 in Three?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.689
Yeah, not only that, but he
wants us to wipe her SSD

02:35.723 --> 02:38.025
so she doesn't remember
he's the Antichrist.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.394
Well, he's the one
with the triple sixes, not us.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.029
It's his show.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.131
What a show it's going to be.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.200
Who the fuck are you?!

02:46.234 --> 02:48.636
Hey, how'd you get past
Ms. Venable?

02:48.669 --> 02:52.139
These little symbols are
Outposts for the survivors

02:52.172 --> 02:55.042
of this little holocaust you're
so gleefully anticipating.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.178
JEFF:
It's not little, lady.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.980
Yeah. Seven billion dead

03:00.013 --> 03:02.383
in the first ten minutes...
starting with you.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.285
(reciting spell in Latin)

03:06.086 --> 03:08.021
(panting)

03:09.423 --> 03:12.826
Outpost Three--
where's it located?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.429
(grunts) It's some place called
the Hawthorne School.

03:15.463 --> 03:19.600
He donated it 'cause it's
underground, naturally shielded.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.570
I see.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.779
Mr. St. Pierre Vanderbilt

03:31.812 --> 03:33.947
will try to purchase
four tickets

03:33.981 --> 03:35.616
for himself and his family.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.950
You'll accept his offer

03:36.984 --> 03:38.719
and secure him a place
at Outpost Three.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.688
Is that clearly understood?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.256
Mm-mmm.
There are no spots left.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.557
Make sure there are.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.894
Planning the end of the world

03:46.927 --> 03:50.464
over a box of hot wings.

03:50.498 --> 03:53.767
I suppose I must get to the most
unpleasant part of my visit.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.869
-What's that?
-The part where I have to leave

03:55.903 --> 03:58.372
before killing you both.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.607
Good day.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.674
(groans)

04:02.576 --> 04:04.612
*

05:09.677 --> 05:11.712
MALLORY:
A thousand nuclear bombs?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.180
How can we stop that?

05:13.213 --> 05:14.715
We can't.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.017
Michael's already too powerful.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.487
He can counteract
anything we hope to try.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.155
God, I finally find my place
in the world,

05:22.189 --> 05:23.857
and now it's all gonna end.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.127
I am not ready to die.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.897
Oh, not to make it all about me.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.533
Actually, it is all
about you now.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.868
Your father will be purchasing
tickets for you and your family

05:34.902 --> 05:37.304
to inhabit one of the
Cooperative's Outposts.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.239
Coco is the plan?

05:39.272 --> 05:40.874
The calorie counter's
gonna save humanity?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.243
No. Mallory is.

05:43.276 --> 05:47.415
Coco is going to secure her
place at the bunker.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.884
We have one chance
to use Tempus Infinituum.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.421
And we can't risk trying it
until Mallory is ready.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.423
The only place where we know
you'll survive

05:55.456 --> 05:56.690
is under Michael's nose.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.426
In one of his bunkers.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.528
He can smell a witch a mile away

06:00.561 --> 06:02.329
like some kind
of evil truffle pig.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.364
He'll kill her
before she can do anything.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.866
CORDELIA:
That's why we're going
to place them both under

06:05.899 --> 06:08.602
an identity spell.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.944
You'll forget
that you're witches.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.613
You'll forget everything you
ever knew about yourselves.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.049
The spell will give you
new identities,

06:22.082 --> 06:24.585
new personalities.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.387
Your job will be
to demean Mallory.

06:27.421 --> 06:31.425
Make her doubt herself in order
to suppress her natural powers,

06:31.459 --> 06:34.795
so that no one can detect
her magic.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.364
MYRTLE:
We've modeled your new
personality after Madison.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.300
No. No, there must be
another way.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.602
Consider it an upgrade.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.474
Will my family still remember
that I'm a witch?

06:46.507 --> 06:48.776
Your family
won't be joining you.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.548
We have to eliminate all
variables that might expose you.

06:54.582 --> 06:58.418
But can we just put them under
a spell, too?

06:58.452 --> 07:01.589
Until the Apocalypse comes, yes.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.492
But it would be too risky

07:04.525 --> 07:06.560
to have them in the bunker
with you.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.930
MYRTLE:
We'll make sure they're
out of the country,

07:09.963 --> 07:14.234
and too far from the Outposts
to make it to safety in time.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.938
My parents are good people
and my brother is kind.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.974
They deserve it
so much more than I do.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.442
MALLORY:
I don't think I can
be responsible

07:22.476 --> 07:24.612
for the lives
of seven billion people.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.279
Yes, you can.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.281
And when the time comes,
you will.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.118
How will I knew when that time
is if I'm under a spell?

07:31.151 --> 07:34.021
Your powers will emerge
when they are ready.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.190
After you cast the spell...

07:37.224 --> 07:38.692
will we remember you?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.263
Not until the spell is broken.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.499
And by then,
we all might be piles of ash.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.536
So this is good-bye.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.139
Gather around, witches.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.046
And so it falls to us

07:59.079 --> 08:01.849
to save mankind from itself.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.384
And yes, some of us will die,

08:04.417 --> 08:06.654
but you two will live.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.622
So the Coven will live on.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.658
So the world will live on.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.626
-You ready?
-COCO: No.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.595
(sniffles)

08:17.364 --> 08:19.800
How could I be mean to you?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.536
You've taught me
everything I know.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.805
You saved my life.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.074
You are my best friend, Mallory,

08:27.107 --> 08:29.209
and I am so sorry

08:29.242 --> 08:31.645
for whatever comes out of my
mouth on the other side.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.146
It's okay.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.515
-I know you won't mean it.
-(laughing)

08:35.549 --> 08:39.519
And spell or no spell, I'd never
let anything bad happen to you.

08:39.553 --> 08:43.356
If the world's gonna end,
at least we'll be together.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.496
COCO:
(sniffles)

08:49.529 --> 08:51.899
Okay. (sniffs)

08:51.932 --> 08:53.934
CORDELIA:
Please sit.

09:25.633 --> 09:29.236
Memoria unda temporis est,

09:29.269 --> 09:32.072
memoria unda

09:32.105 --> 09:35.575
temporis est,

09:35.609 --> 09:37.577

09:37.611 --> 09:40.881

09:40.914 --> 09:42.750
memoria unda

09:42.783 --> 09:45.619
temporis est,

09:45.653 --> 09:47.387

09:47.420 --> 09:50.658

09:55.462 --> 09:57.464
(gasps)

10:14.648 --> 10:16.583
COCO:
Hello! Driver lady,
can you please

10:16.616 --> 10:17.785
put the windows up?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.419
God, I've asked her,
like, ten times,

10:19.452 --> 10:20.754
and she keeps ignoring me.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.289
You're gonna have to just
push lunch.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.523
It's gonna take him
at least two hours

10:23.556 --> 10:26.093
to fix this Phil Spector
"trial wig" look.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.995
We only booked for an hour.
Please don't make me

10:28.028 --> 10:29.797
call them again, Coco.
Mr. Gallant

10:29.830 --> 10:31.464
is the most exclusive stylist
in Beverly Hills.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.433
I had to grovel just to get
this appointment.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.670
Jesus, Mallory, I really can't
do both of our jobs.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.371
(tires screeching)

10:38.405 --> 10:39.707
-MALLORY: Are you okay?
-COCO: God.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.242
All right, ladies, we're here.

10:47.681 --> 10:51.618
Don't forget to rate me
five stars. Please.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.254
Jesus Christ.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.669
-COCO: Okay...
MR. GALLANT: Coco, yes?

11:09.703 --> 11:12.372
Hi. Welcome, bubbeleh.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.807
-Thank you. Mwa. Mwa.
-Hi.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.576
I'm always thrilled
to meet my newest muse.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.378
I'm gonna need you
to clear your afternoon.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.480
-Have you seen my head? Ugh!
-Oh, honey,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.850
a thousand apologies,
but my afternoon is spoken for,

11:22.883 --> 11:24.718
and I never cancel
on long-time clients.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.720
Okay, well...

11:26.754 --> 11:28.088
charge me double,

11:28.121 --> 11:29.723
and consider yourself
on retainer.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.062
So, who do we have
to blame for this?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.730
My crosshairs are on

11:36.764 --> 11:40.233
the literal worst
Uber driver in SoCal.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.735
-Bitch.
-(sighs heavily)

11:41.769 --> 11:44.404
I'm not gonna lie,
she did a number on you, but...

11:44.437 --> 11:47.107
it's nothing my avocado-based
moisturizing milk can't fix.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.112
But I'm sorry, Coco,
I'm just not gonna be able

11:52.145 --> 11:54.247
to work my magic
with this little church mouse

11:54.281 --> 11:56.449
-hovering over your shoulder.
-(Coco sighs)

11:56.483 --> 11:57.885
That's my assistant, Mallory.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.887
(loudly):
Who should be out getting me

11:59.920 --> 12:03.256
my hazelnut macchiato
at exactly 120 degrees.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.725
Sorry, Coco. My bad.
Ten minutes, ten minutes.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.261
-Okay.
-(mouths)

12:08.295 --> 12:10.530
So, what are we thinking--
are we thinking bangs,

12:10.563 --> 12:12.732
-maybe something asymmetrical?
-I don't even care,

12:12.766 --> 12:14.868
as long as I don't look like
a tornado survivor.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.404
-(Mr. Gallant laughs)
-You shouldn't even be here.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.572
Excuse me?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.408
It's a complete waste of time.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.610
No offense
to your stylist, but...

12:23.643 --> 12:25.512
you can't improve on perfection.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.482
(laughs)

12:34.587 --> 12:36.589
A bowl of Moroccan Harira

12:36.623 --> 12:39.993
is the perfect thing
to fortify the soul.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.729
No, thank you, Myrtle.
I'm not hungry.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.132
I want permission
to burn a witch.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.167
The only reason to burn a witch

12:47.200 --> 12:50.670
is if said witch causes
grievous harm to another.

12:50.703 --> 12:53.506
What if she helped to destroy
the entire coven?

12:54.541 --> 12:55.575
Who?

12:55.608 --> 12:56.743
Dinah Stevens.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.411
She has a new talk show on TV.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.780
I saw the ad
on the side of a bus.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.483
There is no way that bitch
could get a show on television

13:03.516 --> 13:05.819
without selling her soul
to the devil.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.588
Double-crossing us was her way
to get a ticket to the Outpost.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.258
-It doesn't matter.
-Of course it matters.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.926
We have to clear the rot.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.795
Madison, you get the gasoline,
I'll get the wood.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.031
No. We cannot afford
to do anything

13:18.065 --> 13:20.633
that might alert Michael
to our plan.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.871
Delia, she will be a danger
to our girls!

13:23.904 --> 13:26.206
Dinah has never seen them.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.608
Our identity spell
is more powerful

13:28.641 --> 13:31.544
than anything that
voodoo queen could penetrate.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.515
I want her safe and sound

13:35.548 --> 13:37.684
until we are ready

13:37.717 --> 13:39.652
to make her pay.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.531
MALLORY:
Sometimes I feel like there's
someone buried inside me,

13:51.564 --> 13:53.566
someone trying
to claw their way out.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.003
Who?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.738
I don't know.
I just want to go.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.542
-Let me go.
-Don't be afraid, Mallory.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.877
I'm offering you
a chance to live.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.712
(booming):
I said let me go!

14:14.721 --> 14:15.923
(hisses)

14:25.198 --> 14:26.366
Who are you?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.588
(gasping breaths)

14:50.623 --> 14:52.425
(rasps, pants)

14:54.327 --> 14:56.629
(coughing)

14:56.663 --> 14:58.631
Well, that sucked ass.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.700
I had worms crawling up my nose

15:00.733 --> 15:03.136
and God knows where else.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.871
How long have we
been buried down there?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.139
MYRTLE:
Oh, I don't know.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.476
A year, maybe two.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.612
The healing properties
of Louisiana swamp mud, dear.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.385
Delia...

15:18.418 --> 15:20.620
you felt it, too.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.423
It's time.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.825
*

15:47.614 --> 15:49.616
*

16:03.230 --> 16:04.497
Find our sisters.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.800
(gasps)

16:23.050 --> 16:25.452
-I don't know what's going on.
-MYRTLE: Poor dear.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.287
To be raised up and released
from an identity spell

16:27.320 --> 16:29.456
at the same moment.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.691
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.526
What do you mean,
identity spell?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.296
We placed it on you
for your protection.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.864
Coco, too.

16:37.897 --> 16:41.034
It kept you from knowing
your true self.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.369
Why?

16:42.402 --> 16:44.871
Because you're special, Mallory.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.540
And we need you.
We need all of you.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.909
You're on your own
with that shit.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.312
I'm not here to defeat anyone.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.514
LANGDON:
How can any of you defeat me...

16:54.547 --> 16:57.084
when I've already won?

16:57.117 --> 16:59.219
You haven't won.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.488
Perhaps you haven't noticed
the state of the world.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.656
It's almost as bad
as your dinner jacket.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.825
But at least the world
can be saved.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.160
By you?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.262
-By all of us.
-Hey.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.165
Get the wax out of your ears.
I'm here to watch.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.733
But I'm not.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.371
Just don't let me
die again, okay?

17:18.405 --> 17:19.572
It really sucked the first time.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.241
When I'm done,

17:21.274 --> 17:23.376
you'll all wish
you were still dead.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.612
I always thought the world
would end with fire and ice,

17:25.645 --> 17:27.414
not witches and warlocks.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.616
The seventh seal
has been broken.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.751
Wormwood has fallen from the sky

17:31.784 --> 17:34.554
and turned the rivers
to blood and fire.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.290
The bottomless pit
has been opened

17:37.324 --> 17:41.094
and my swarms of locusts and
scorpions have ravaged humanity.

17:41.128 --> 17:44.531
The world has been remade
in my father's image.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.399
(chuckles):
Darling...

17:46.433 --> 17:48.801
it seems Daddy didn't tell you
the most important rule

17:48.835 --> 17:50.603
of bringing on the Apocalypse.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.306
If you want to finish the job,

17:53.340 --> 17:54.741
the thing you have to do first

17:54.774 --> 17:57.710
is get rid of all the witches.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.246
Big mistake.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.114
I could annihilate
all of you in a second

18:01.148 --> 18:04.417
and the world would go on
without missing a beat.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.120
You and all of your work
will be forgotten

18:07.154 --> 18:09.256
in the rubble of the past.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.624
But I want to give you a future.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.563
Fall to your knees and accept me
as your lord and savior,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.465
and I will bring you
to the table

18:18.498 --> 18:21.201
as my obedient subjects.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.971
(chuckling)

18:25.004 --> 18:26.306
MEAD:
Imbeciles!

18:26.339 --> 18:29.909
Fall to your knees
before the king!

18:29.942 --> 18:32.612
-Hail Satan!
-CORDELIA: The only way

18:32.645 --> 18:35.682
we would sit at your table
is if your decapitated head

18:35.715 --> 18:37.484
were the centerpiece.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.486
DINAH:
Cordelia,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.654
you raised me from the dead

18:41.688 --> 18:44.924
so that you would have
the power of voodoo

18:44.957 --> 18:47.494
on your side.

18:47.527 --> 18:51.531
But if you know anything
about who I am,

18:51.564 --> 18:55.268
you know that
the only choice I'd pick

18:55.302 --> 18:57.637
would be the winner.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.107
You're half right, Dinah.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.210
LAVEAU:
She needed the help

19:03.243 --> 19:06.646
of a powerful voodoo queen.
(chuckles)

19:06.679 --> 19:10.183
But that ain't you, sis.

19:10.217 --> 19:14.053
-(echoing cries)
-LaLAURIE:
Oh, God, no more. Have mercy!

19:14.086 --> 19:17.890
No more cruelty for my babies.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.160
You're a monster!

19:21.194 --> 19:24.531
Yes, I sinned.
I gave no quarter.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.999
But even when I was
killing that bastard,

19:27.033 --> 19:29.336
-I spared his mammy...
-Shh!

19:32.104 --> 19:35.174
What do you want?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.577
Papa Legba told me to tell you

19:37.610 --> 19:39.912
you are a pain in his ass.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.515
Apparently
your work has been subpar.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.983
(exclaims quietly)

19:44.016 --> 19:46.453
You have no heart for torture,
Marie Laveau.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.624
So I made him an offer
I knew he couldn't refuse.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.927
LAVEAU:
To release me from hell,

19:54.961 --> 19:58.431
Cordelia promised Papa Legba...
(chuckles)

19:58.465 --> 20:00.900
the darkest and most corrupt

20:00.933 --> 20:03.370
voodoo queen's soul for mine.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.372
You'll serve him well

20:05.405 --> 20:07.073
in my place.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.743
You're a fool, Marie Laveau.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.447
You would have done no different
if you were queen.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.482
No!

20:16.616 --> 20:18.285
(gasps)

20:18.318 --> 20:20.720
(screaming)

20:22.755 --> 20:24.757
Out with the trash.

20:24.791 --> 20:28.495
Give Papa my regards.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.697
(clacking)

20:30.730 --> 20:32.399
(speaks Latin)

20:32.432 --> 20:35.568
(Mead grunting convulsively)

20:35.602 --> 20:37.904
(mechanical whirring)

20:37.937 --> 20:39.238
Ms. Mead?

20:44.977 --> 20:46.979
(muffled gibberish)

20:48.247 --> 20:52.752
* Daisy, Daisy

20:52.785 --> 20:56.589
* Give me your answer do

20:58.925 --> 21:02.395
* I'm half

21:02.429 --> 21:04.897
* Crazy

21:04.931 --> 21:08.835
* All for the love of

21:08.868 --> 21:11.103
(pitch wavering):
* You...

21:13.473 --> 21:14.874
(whispers):
You.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.980
Madison!

21:23.850 --> 21:26.619
Sorry about your little toy...

21:26.653 --> 21:27.687
bitch.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.445
(whispers):
My goodness.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.980
Smooth as silk.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.454
A personal item.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.155
Remember, dear--

22:03.189 --> 22:05.024
focus on it.

22:05.057 --> 22:09.195
Use it to locate a time and
place early in Michael's life.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.197
-Shed the ego.
-MYRTLE: Shed the ego.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.633
Disengage from this realm.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.668
Place myself there

22:15.702 --> 22:17.670
and say the words.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.306
Tempus Infinituum.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.509
That's our girl.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.744
Bullets alone won't kill him.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.513
He's become too powerful.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.714
We have to find a place

22:27.747 --> 22:30.483
to cast the spell
before he wakes up.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.552
I'll hold him off
as long as I can.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.688
You've got this.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.924
Go. Go!

22:37.957 --> 22:40.259
Come on.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.569
-(gasps)
-I should have been
on that plane!

22:51.103 --> 22:54.574
(distorted):
Mallory!

22:59.546 --> 23:01.047
What have you done, you cretin?!

23:01.080 --> 23:03.583
It's payback, bitch.
I serve it cold.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.618
I like it hot! Ignis.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.120
(shouting)

23:09.489 --> 23:11.458
(screams)

23:11.491 --> 23:13.125
(thud)

23:25.738 --> 23:28.107
Oh, fuck.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.777
I guess it's back to retail.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.264
(distorted):
Balneum infinitum.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.548
(blowing)

24:26.032 --> 24:28.501
(blowing)

24:30.302 --> 24:31.538
He's coming!

24:32.505 --> 24:34.541
Get her out of here!

24:35.642 --> 24:36.475
No matter what happens,

24:36.509 --> 24:37.677
it's better than where I was.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.426
(speaking Creole)

24:56.529 --> 24:58.865
(exhales)

24:58.898 --> 25:01.400
You will not pass.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.702
(snarl)

25:04.370 --> 25:08.507
You're dealing
with the HBIC now.

25:08.541 --> 25:11.611
You really think your stupid
voodoo spells can stop me?

25:12.879 --> 25:15.748
(grunts, groaning)

25:15.782 --> 25:18.217
-Is that all you've got?
-(gasping)

25:21.087 --> 25:23.590
Not exactly.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.760
Die again, fuck face!

25:27.794 --> 25:30.296
(gasping)

25:32.965 --> 25:34.967
(exhales)

25:36.468 --> 25:39.672
Normally, that'd work.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.708
(grunts)

25:47.614 --> 25:49.982
But I'm nothing like normal.

25:57.489 --> 25:58.725
(snap)

26:02.161 --> 26:04.463
(grunting)

26:06.999 --> 26:08.768
(exhales)

26:08.801 --> 26:11.270
MYRTLE and CORDELIA:
Balneum infinitum.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.873
Dona salui conductus.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.308
Dona salui
conductus.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.377
Balneum infinitum.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.880
Dona salui conductus.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.448
Don...

26:22.481 --> 26:24.984
Come on, Mallory, please.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.987
Please.
Mallory, come on, come on.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.889
Look at me, look at me.
You can do this.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.091
You can do this.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.794
You can do this.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.663
It's not working. It...

26:36.696 --> 26:38.665
it's not working.
She's not strong enough.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.732
(sniffles)

26:39.766 --> 26:41.267
I'm sorry, Cordelia.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.969
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.771
Look at me.
No, no, no, no, no,

26:44.804 --> 26:46.739
no, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.575
(sniffles, panting)

26:49.608 --> 26:52.444
Come on. Come on.

26:52.478 --> 26:53.746
(shouts)

26:53.780 --> 26:55.514
(panting)

26:55.547 --> 26:58.050
(sniffles)

27:00.219 --> 27:03.055
-(cries)
-It appears as though
we're fucked, my dear.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.401
I love you.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.947
How did you think
this would end?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.849
Prophecy is inevitable.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.852
I was always going to win...

27:32.885 --> 27:34.486
Miss Supreme.

27:35.521 --> 27:37.323
Not on your own.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.291
You've been led by the hand,

27:39.325 --> 27:41.160
coddled, the entire way.

27:41.193 --> 27:44.496
By your father, the warlocks.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.499
I look at you
and I don't see a man.

27:47.533 --> 27:51.537
I see a sad, scared little boy

27:51.570 --> 27:53.339
so pathetic
he couldn't even kill me

27:53.372 --> 27:55.474
with a thousand nuclear bombs.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.476
But I never expected to.

27:57.509 --> 28:01.247
Like a cockroach, I knew you'd
survive the nuclear fallout.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.082
I wanted you to.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.017
And now I'm gonna have
the satisfaction

28:05.051 --> 28:06.252
of watching you die,

28:06.285 --> 28:07.419
knowing you failed.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.488
You still don't get it, do you?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.090
Even now.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.560
You think
there's only winning and losing,

28:14.593 --> 28:17.263
success and failure.

28:17.296 --> 28:21.734
But failure is when you've lost
any semblance of hope.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.170
You will get to watch me die,

28:24.203 --> 28:26.605
but you won't find it
satisfying.

28:31.577 --> 28:35.347
Satan has one son,

28:35.381 --> 28:38.617
but my sisters are legion,
motherfucker.

28:40.619 --> 28:41.620
(gasps)

28:42.488 --> 28:43.589
Cordelia!

29:02.474 --> 29:05.144
Tempus Infinituum!

29:06.979 --> 29:09.415
No!

29:37.043 --> 29:39.011
-(knocking)
-CONSTANCE (whispers): Michael.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.215
(video game sounds)

29:55.527 --> 29:57.830
Tell me something, Michael.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.631
Do you have to kill

29:59.665 --> 30:02.634
every single living creature

30:02.668 --> 30:05.271
that crosses your path?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.706
Could you maybe just maim one?

30:07.739 --> 30:11.443
Or how about this
for a novel idea:

30:11.477 --> 30:14.546
if they are
causing you distress,

30:14.580 --> 30:16.983
why don't you just

30:17.016 --> 30:19.852
politely ask them to leave?

30:19.886 --> 30:21.287
(controller clatters)

30:21.320 --> 30:23.055
He kept shoving his cross
in my face

30:23.089 --> 30:24.857
and speaking Latin.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.059
The words were burning my ears.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.795
Now, I know

30:29.828 --> 30:32.531
that I am far from perfect.

30:32.564 --> 30:36.402
And I know that I have had
my fair share of failures,

30:36.435 --> 30:38.704
raising children.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.875
But I am done

30:42.909 --> 30:45.511
taking the blame

30:45.544 --> 30:48.314
for the horror and misery

30:48.347 --> 30:51.650
that you keep bringing
in this house.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.419
I'm sorry.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.854
I-I won't do it again. I'm...

30:55.888 --> 30:59.058
I promise.

30:59.091 --> 31:02.794
I don't know why I keep doing
what I'm doing.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.565
I-I need help.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.434
I'm just a child.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.869
No, you are not a child.

31:10.903 --> 31:14.373
My grandson is a child.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.610
And I see his eyes in your eyes,

31:18.644 --> 31:22.514
and I hear the remnant
of his sweet voice

31:22.548 --> 31:24.116
-in your throat.
-(whimpering)

31:25.417 --> 31:27.119
But you are not him.

31:27.153 --> 31:29.455
Now, you may have
somehow claimed his bed,

31:29.488 --> 31:32.724
but you are not... him!

31:36.395 --> 31:37.896
Please don't be mad.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.532
You have made a fool of me
this entire time,

31:40.566 --> 31:42.768
treating me like the help.

31:42.801 --> 31:46.572
All the buried rodents
and the murdered nannies.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.374
And I went along with it,

31:48.407 --> 31:51.277
thinking it was just a phase
that you were going through.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.911
But this is not a phase.

31:52.945 --> 31:56.148
This is who you are!

31:56.182 --> 31:58.450
And it's only gonna get worse.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.886
But I swear to God,

32:00.919 --> 32:05.591
it is not going to happen
in my house.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.995
What do you mean?

32:09.028 --> 32:10.997
Get out!

32:11.030 --> 32:14.600
Get out.
I don't care where you go.

32:14.633 --> 32:18.104
You can sleep on a park bench
or under an overpass.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.772
I don't care!

32:20.806 --> 32:22.274
Please don't be mad.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.443
Please. I'll change.
I promise.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.479
I don't want you!
(crying)

32:27.513 --> 32:30.482
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!

32:30.516 --> 32:32.818
Don't you ever come back.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.457
(grunting)

32:38.490 --> 32:41.493
(choking)

32:43.862 --> 32:45.431
(strained):
Go ahead, do it.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.167
Put me out of my misery.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.636
(grunts)

32:50.669 --> 32:53.139
(panting)

32:56.242 --> 32:58.444
But...

32:58.477 --> 33:01.547
but you won't, will you?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.350
Because you're a coward.

33:04.383 --> 33:05.817
And deep down inside,

33:05.851 --> 33:08.554
you know it.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.627
(door opens, closes in distance)

33:15.661 --> 33:18.097
*

33:35.181 --> 33:37.283
(grunts)

33:54.700 --> 33:56.302
(grunts)

34:22.728 --> 34:24.730
(wheezing)

34:32.438 --> 34:35.441
I... I'm scared.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.412
Oh...

34:43.449 --> 34:46.418
Take me...

34:46.452 --> 34:49.488
to the hou-house.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.792
I can be with you.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.029
Forever.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.004
Please.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.015
Go to hell.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.390
MALLORY:
Nothing ever truly dies.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.991
We are all made of energy,

36:00.025 --> 36:02.561
and energy can neither
be created nor destroyed.

36:02.594 --> 36:06.465
It can only be transferred
from one form to another.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.301
The trick
is to be able to go back

36:09.335 --> 36:10.669
and pick the right
moment in time

36:10.702 --> 36:12.238
and let it play out from there.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.506
I see you know some magic.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.710
Not the way you do.

36:24.916 --> 36:28.186
Welcome to Robichaux Academy.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.922
Oh. (chuckles)

36:30.956 --> 36:32.924
You're a hugger.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.494
-Sorry.
-No, that's all right.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.563
I'm Cordelia.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.998
I'm Mallory.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.500
It's nice to meet you, Mallory.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.201
(chuckles)

36:53.745 --> 36:55.614
Have we met?

36:55.647 --> 36:58.417
I guess I just have one
of those faces.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.354
Huh.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.591
So...

37:05.624 --> 37:07.526
how did you find your way to us?

37:07.559 --> 37:11.129
I saw you on TV and somehow knew
this was where I needed to be.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.465
My parents caught me floating
in my sleep,

37:13.499 --> 37:16.067
and now they think I'm some type
of devil worshipper.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.604
Maybe we can be your new home.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.739
-Would you like that?
-Very much.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.041
No one knows who I am
at Robichaux,

37:23.074 --> 37:24.976
but I remember all my sisters.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.212
They never knew what happened--

37:27.245 --> 37:28.447
that the world
had been destroyed

37:28.480 --> 37:30.248
and their lives had all ended.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.951
Everything is as it should be.

37:32.984 --> 37:36.087
Zoe is alive and well, teaching
the next generation of witches.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.824
But there were others
who would be missed.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.592
CORDELIA:
This is Myrtle Snow.

37:40.626 --> 37:41.627
MALLORY:
Without the threat
of Armageddon,

37:41.660 --> 37:43.228
Cordelia had no reason

37:43.261 --> 37:45.230
to bring back
her beloved advisor.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.466
CORDELIA:
And she's the greatest witch
I've ever known.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.401
Our coven
wouldn't have flourished

37:49.435 --> 37:50.769
if it weren't for her wisdom.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.204
She made me who I am.

37:55.206 --> 37:57.509
I think
you would have liked her.

37:57.543 --> 38:00.011
I know I would.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.180
Come on.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.416
(Queenie whoops)

38:04.450 --> 38:06.585
-Guess who's going to Hollywood.
-CORDELIA: You are.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.454
-(Cordelia chuckles)
-Yes. I just got my tickets

38:08.487 --> 38:11.623
for The Price is Right
'cause it's Plinko all day, ho.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.825
And I found
a really cute hotel.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.828
It's, like, old,
but it's just been renovated,

38:16.862 --> 38:19.164
-and it's downtown.
It's kind of...
-No.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.167
I know I don't
know you well, but...

38:22.200 --> 38:23.669
you don't want to stay downtown.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.371
Who's this?

38:25.404 --> 38:27.272
Hi. I'm Mallory.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.474
Queenie.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.677
This is Mallory,
and it's her first day.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.546
-Ah. Welcome.
-MALLORY: I've just heard

38:34.580 --> 38:36.281
the traffic in L.A. is brutal,

38:36.314 --> 38:38.484
and it would take you over
an hour to get to the beach.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.318
QUEENIE:
Right, yeah. Uh...

38:40.352 --> 38:42.721
I'm not gonna fly 2,000 miles
just to see highway.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.357
I guess I'll stay in Venice.
Be better.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.726
MALLORY:
It's strange, knowing
you have the power

38:47.759 --> 38:49.461
to alter someone else's fate.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.863
I know where Madison is.

38:51.897 --> 38:55.967
-We'll have to go to Hell
and bring her back.
-(baby crying)

38:56.001 --> 38:58.370
But she can sweat it out
a little longer.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.406
(electricity crackling)

39:08.414 --> 39:10.982
Hi, bitches.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.918
Nan?

39:12.951 --> 39:15.320
MALLORY:
Because I killed
the spawn of Satan,

39:15.353 --> 39:16.822
I got blazing street cred

39:16.855 --> 39:19.391
with the demons
of the underworld.

39:19.425 --> 39:21.993
Misty?

39:22.027 --> 39:24.996
Oh, my... Oh, my...

39:25.030 --> 39:26.698
How can this be?

39:26.732 --> 39:28.333
MALLORY:
Guess everyone
hates their boss,

39:28.366 --> 39:30.101
even in Hell.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.503
Everybody wanted
to do me a favor.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.205
-You're back.
-(Cordelia and Misty chuckle)

39:34.239 --> 39:36.041
How can this be possible?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.343
How is it possible?

39:38.376 --> 39:41.413
Oh, Ms. Cordelia.
(sighs)

39:41.447 --> 39:45.050
I never thought
I'd escape my personal hell.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.752
And then this one,

39:46.785 --> 39:48.420
she showed up

39:48.454 --> 39:50.856
-with the voodoo demon.
-(chuckles)

39:50.889 --> 39:52.624
Took my hand

39:52.658 --> 39:54.726
and guided me home.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.895
I'm Papa's favorite.
He's my boo.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.396
He sends me on errands.

39:58.430 --> 40:01.132
-I have to go now.
-Wait, wait, Nan.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.401
-Where are you going?
-Back to Papa.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.237
I like it down there.
Papa lets me play.

40:06.271 --> 40:07.706
I-I don't understand.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.374
You're not supposed to.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.742
Just say thank you.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.951
Misty.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.153
I would like you to meet

40:22.187 --> 40:24.556
an exceptional young witch.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.325
This is Mallory.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.360
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.565
I'm pleased
to make your acquaintance.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.266
It's great to meet you, Misty.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.669
I'm sure you two
have a lot to catch up on.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.774
-(Cordelia chuckles)
-Oh.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.176
MALLORY:
The battle between
good and evil never ends.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.612
-How I've missed you.
-MALLORY: The Devil

40:46.645 --> 40:48.346
isn't just going to give up.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.615
I was ever so lost.

40:49.648 --> 40:50.749
MALLORY:
And in changing the past,

40:50.782 --> 40:53.619
a part of me will always wonder

40:53.652 --> 40:56.655
what it truly means
for the future.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.592
(chanting): Know who's forced
to pick those beans!

41:00.626 --> 41:02.628
Unpaid little kids and teens!

41:02.661 --> 41:04.830
Hi, um, would you be willing

41:04.863 --> 41:06.632
to sign our petition
for child labor?

41:06.665 --> 41:10.435
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.539
I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.440
(chanting continues)

41:15.473 --> 41:17.175
I'm sorry.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.644
Is it bad?

41:21.346 --> 41:22.548
Uh, it's...

41:22.581 --> 41:24.282
it's...

41:24.315 --> 41:25.984
it's okay.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.385
I'd be happy
to buy you another coffee.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.788
Just... just not from here.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.422
What's wrong
with the coffee here?

41:33.491 --> 41:36.828
Child labor.
Habitat destruction. GMO beans.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.497
Look, I know a great place
across campus by my dorm,

41:39.531 --> 41:41.299
so, for the sake
of the Brazilian children,

41:41.332 --> 41:43.501
I'd be happy
to get you a coffee from there.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.403
You know, I'm actually
part Brazilian.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.405
Really?

41:47.438 --> 41:51.509
Yeah. According to my 23andMe,
like, .07%.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.311
PROTESTORS:
Know who's forced
to pick those beans!

41:53.344 --> 41:55.346
Unpaid little kids and teens!

41:55.380 --> 41:58.516
So, for the sake of your people,
sign our petition?

41:58.550 --> 42:02.487
I will gladly
sign your petition...

42:02.520 --> 42:05.557
Know who's forced
to pick those beans!

42:05.591 --> 42:08.627
...for my replacement cup
of coffee.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.063
It's a date.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.332
I'm Emily, by the way.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.703
Timothy.
It's nice to meet someone

42:17.736 --> 42:19.805
who's clearly going to change
the world.

42:22.808 --> 42:24.442
(Emily screaming)

42:26.111 --> 42:28.113
(crying)

42:28.146 --> 42:30.582
You're doing great.
You're doing great, okay?

42:30.616 --> 42:32.383
-I can't do this.
-Just breathe.

42:32.417 --> 42:33.685
It hurts so bad.

42:33.719 --> 42:35.954
I'm not ready.

42:35.987 --> 42:38.023
-We're not ready. (panting)
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look at me.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.291
Look at me. Hey. Yes.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.461
Yes, we are. Breathe.

42:43.494 --> 42:46.331
(both breathing deeply)

42:47.398 --> 42:49.567
(Emily screaming)

42:51.670 --> 42:54.272
We actually had
an adult conversation.

42:54.305 --> 42:56.708
I know. We needed it.

42:56.742 --> 42:58.977
I mean, who would've thought
that watching a three-year-old

42:59.010 --> 43:01.780
would be more exhausting
than ten hours at work?

43:01.813 --> 43:03.448
He never stops.

43:03.481 --> 43:05.651
He seems so angry.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.786
Last year we thought
it was just the terrible twos.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.387
That's our fault.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.389
We should've taught him
how to count.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.424
(chuckles)

43:24.102 --> 43:26.037
(Emily sighs)

43:28.106 --> 43:30.075
Oh, the AC went out again.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.644
It's so hot in here,
I honestly dread going to bed.

43:32.678 --> 43:35.146
I will call the repairman.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.182
(crows cawing)

43:40.185 --> 43:42.120
That's weird.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.369
EMILY:
Do you have money
for the sitter?

43:58.403 --> 44:02.207
Uh... (exhales)

44:02.240 --> 44:05.510
Is a, uh, ten dollar tip enough?

44:08.579 --> 44:09.848
Honey.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.583
Shit.

44:15.553 --> 44:16.755
(Emily gasps)

44:22.694 --> 44:24.562
Oh, my God, Devan.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.899
What did you do?

44:29.901 --> 44:32.537
Oh, my God.

44:35.707 --> 44:37.575
(knocking)

44:48.553 --> 44:52.523
Hello. I am Anton LaVey.

44:52.557 --> 44:54.860
You may know me
as the Black Pope.

44:54.893 --> 44:58.429
Oh, it's nice and hot inside.

45:00.398 --> 45:02.500
We've been waiting
our whole lives for this.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.936
We're here to help.

45:07.538 --> 45:09.474
