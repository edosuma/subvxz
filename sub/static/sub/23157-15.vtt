WEBVTT

00:00.198 --> 00:03.224
- $500?
- It's called an attention-getter.

00:03.301 --> 00:05.929
I'm a private investigator.
I don't play games.

00:09.574 --> 00:12.338
Some wives drink,
some take lovers.

00:12.410 --> 00:13.707
I play.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.274
I hold you responsible
for everything that's happened.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.681
You think she'd risk dying?

00:20.752 --> 00:23.846
She would risk anything
to keep the game going.

02:50.752 --> 02:52.720
You shot them. Are they...

02:52.787 --> 02:54.721
They're dead.
Of course, darling.

02:54.789 --> 02:57.758
All dealers get it eventually.
And so will we.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.126
Someday.

03:01.196 --> 03:05.792
Well, what are we going to do now? Bury them
under some dead brush and set them on fire.

03:05.867 --> 03:08.165
You take the car.

03:08.236 --> 03:10.227
I'll meet you back at the club.

03:47.175 --> 03:49.666
Is she always like this?

03:52.513 --> 03:54.640
500 for you,

03:55.683 --> 03:59.312
350 for your friend because he
didn't have to do any real acting.

04:01.456 --> 04:03.686
And for the rental of the plane.

04:03.758 --> 04:06.386
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

04:06.461 --> 04:10.454
When she went for the gun...
I mean, I knew it was a gag...

04:11.532 --> 04:13.500
but for one second,

04:14.502 --> 04:16.697
I didn't think she was acting.

04:29.817 --> 04:32.479
This morning was like
any other on Oahu.

04:32.553 --> 04:36.080
A beautiful woman named Christie
Odebolt had hired me to,

04:36.157 --> 04:40.491
uh, play games
with her sister Louise.

04:40.561 --> 04:45.430
She said games. I would have said helping
a rich girl live out her fantasies.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.094
Okay, so it wasn't
like any other morning,

04:48.169 --> 04:51.366
but one has to be ready
to expect the unexpected.

04:51.439 --> 04:54.567
At any rate, I wasn't gonna
let it affect my workout.

04:57.469 --> 04:59.164
Hi, guys.

05:03.584 --> 05:05.984
I'm afraid I've opened it
by mistake.

05:06.988 --> 05:10.719
My assumption, of course, was that Mable Dodge
sent it over as a thank-you for our lunch.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.283
Mable Dodge.
She's the designer...

05:13.361 --> 05:15.352
who's doing over the guesthouse.

05:19.233 --> 05:23.636
I'd never seen a black orchid before, although
technically they can't exist, you know.

05:24.639 --> 05:28.405
The box doesn't have the florist's name on
it, and the card doesn't reveal a thing.

05:28.476 --> 05:33.277
- Higgins, you opened it, and you read my card.
- How else could I have known who it was for?

05:38.086 --> 05:40.418
"" The Black Orchid"?

05:45.426 --> 05:47.417
Whoever can that be?

05:48.930 --> 05:51.990
Higgins, the orchid was just a joke.
Rick and T.C.

05:52.066 --> 05:54.159
Why don't you
take it back into the house?

05:54.235 --> 05:57.466
I don't think I've ever encountered
a Rolls of that vintage in the Islands.

05:57.538 --> 05:59.472
It's simply impeccable.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.373
Terrific. Why don't you take the
orchid back into the house, Higgins?

06:02.443 --> 06:04.434
I'd like to meet the owner,
if you don't mind.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.894
Which of you is Thomas Magnum,
the famous private investigator?

06:36.010 --> 06:38.001
I'm the Black Orchid.

06:38.079 --> 06:39.706
I say, you're who?

06:41.916 --> 06:45.215
- Who is this little man?
- Well, he sort of runs things around here.

06:45.286 --> 06:47.652
Higgins, I'd like you to meet...

06:47.722 --> 06:49.656
Orchid.

06:49.724 --> 06:53.524
He was just admiring your Rolls. He's
an expert on classic and antique cars.

06:53.594 --> 06:58.361
Isn't that right, Higgins? Well, yes. I have been
consulted on the restoration of rare automobiles.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.492
Would you have a light?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

07:00.568 --> 07:03.696
In fact, the Hawaiian Antique Motorcar
Society asked me to present a paper...

07:03.771 --> 07:06.763
on the proper restoration of vehicles
that have been exposed to salt air.

07:06.841 --> 07:08.775
It really can be
quite devastating.

07:08.843 --> 07:14.782
Right. And he would like to take a look at
your Rolls while we have our little chat.

07:14.849 --> 07:18.250
Well, it's really just another car.
Are you Mr. Magnum's assistant?

07:30.565 --> 07:35.400
I say, it's a 1936,
Gurney Nutting Sedanca CoupÃ©, isn't it?

07:35.470 --> 07:38.633
Extraordinary. Uh, would you
mind lifting the bonnet?

07:40.441 --> 07:43.968
Mr. Magnum,
I am desperate for help.

07:44.045 --> 07:47.776
Someone is trying to kill me,
and I'm terrified.

07:48.950 --> 07:52.408
Do you know who?
I can't tell you.

07:52.487 --> 07:55.012
Or why?
Please don't ask me that.

07:55.089 --> 07:58.616
Well, what about how, Miss
DeBolt, or is that a secret too?

07:58.693 --> 08:00.888
Of course it's not a secret.

08:04.365 --> 08:06.424
What did you call me?

08:07.668 --> 08:09.932
You just called me Miss DeBolt.

08:10.004 --> 08:12.768
Of course.
Because that's who you are.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.468
Magnum, darling.

08:16.944 --> 08:20.744
You don't understand.
This isn't how we play.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.813
First of all,
the clothes are all wrong.

08:24.886 --> 08:28.822
It should be a double-breasted gabardine
and a hat with a snap brim,

08:28.890 --> 08:32.155
and secondly, why couldn't
we have met in your office?

08:32.226 --> 08:35.821
Everybody knows that private investigators
work out of seedy buildings...

08:35.897 --> 08:38.126
and their names are on the doors
with frosted glass.

08:38.198 --> 08:42.966
- Louise, will you calm down? - And you do not
know my name since we have only just met...

08:43.037 --> 08:45.028
and my identity is a secret.

08:45.106 --> 08:47.472
That is why I sent the black orchid.

08:48.776 --> 08:51.267
Now, Magnum,

08:53.080 --> 08:55.105
shall we try it one more time?

08:56.851 --> 08:59.285
Mr. Magnum.

08:59.353 --> 09:01.378
Thomas Magnum,
the famous private investigator?

09:02.523 --> 09:05.720
At your service.
You look like a dame...

09:09.363 --> 09:11.297
I'm sorry.

09:11.365 --> 09:13.959
I'm sorry. Let me try it again.
I'll do it right.

09:16.637 --> 09:18.571
At your service.

09:19.574 --> 09:21.508
You look like a dame
in big trouble.

09:22.944 --> 09:27.142
Do you know who I am?
You could only be the Black Orchid.

09:27.214 --> 09:29.876
I'd know you anywhere
by your perfume.

09:35.189 --> 09:37.919
Do you have a light? No.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.551
No.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.529
Of course not.

09:56.310 --> 09:59.746
Do you know that ever since you've taken
my case, I have felt so protected...

09:59.814 --> 10:01.748
and so safe for the first time...

10:01.816 --> 10:04.751
that I know that the man
with one ear will be foiled.

10:04.819 --> 10:06.753
The one-eared man?
Oh, you remember.

10:06.821 --> 10:11.190
The one who's vowed vengeance on me
because I rejected his romantic advances.

10:12.259 --> 10:15.160
Sure, baby. Sure.

10:15.229 --> 10:18.062
It just slipped my mind.
That's all.

10:18.132 --> 10:20.123
That's because I'm on guard,

10:20.201 --> 10:24.103
expecting an attack. And because the
touch of my hand drives you crazy.

10:24.171 --> 10:26.105
What? I feel it too.

10:26.173 --> 10:28.607
It's the electricity,
the chemistry between us.

10:28.676 --> 10:31.770
It's overwhelming, it's
overpowering, crushing us together.

10:35.383 --> 10:39.376
I don't think you realize
how vulnerable we really are.

10:39.453 --> 10:41.444
Rick and T.C.

10:42.757 --> 10:44.748
I mean the one-eyed man.

10:46.260 --> 10:48.558
The one-eared man. What?

10:48.629 --> 10:50.722
The one-eared man.

10:50.798 --> 10:53.096
The one-eared man. Of course.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.903
I know you're fighting
your code of honor,

10:57.972 --> 11:00.668
but this feeling's just too intense.

11:00.741 --> 11:03.471
You can't help yourself...

11:03.544 --> 11:05.978
and I can't resist.

11:27.168 --> 11:29.602
- No!
- Rick, make it look good.

11:32.740 --> 11:35.208
Save me! Please, save me!

11:37.278 --> 11:39.473
I've got to save
the Black Orchid.

11:45.553 --> 11:47.919
Louise, get the car.

11:47.988 --> 11:51.549
Oh, never.
I'll never leave you, my darling.

11:54.428 --> 11:56.396
Yes.

11:59.967 --> 12:03.903
T.C., it's too hard. Give up,
or I'll set her loose on ya.

12:03.971 --> 12:07.236
Give up, or I'll... I give up!
Don't kill me!

12:07.308 --> 12:09.902
Don't kill me!

12:09.977 --> 12:12.275
You were wonderful.!

12:12.346 --> 12:15.873
Oh. You were wonderful.

12:46.814 --> 12:49.681
My hero.

12:56.223 --> 12:58.521
I know what you're thinking.

12:58.592 --> 13:03.029
After the phony beach attack, I should
have said good-bye to Louise and meant it.

13:03.097 --> 13:07.158
But you know something?
I was starting to have a good time.

13:07.234 --> 13:12.297
Maybe she wasn't the only one who had fantasies
about famous detectives who were heroes.

13:12.373 --> 13:15.274
Magnum, I do hope you're not
going to be underfoot...

13:15.342 --> 13:17.276
while the renovations
are going on.

13:17.344 --> 13:19.369
Renovations?

13:19.446 --> 13:22.438
You said something about
a little paint to freshen up the place.

13:22.516 --> 13:24.484
Basically, that's all we're doing.

13:24.552 --> 13:26.782
While you were swimming,
Rick called.

13:26.854 --> 13:28.788
"" Basically"?

13:28.856 --> 13:32.952
Something about the woman
in the alleyway last night.

13:33.027 --> 13:36.724
What about her? He said to tell you
it was the wife of Wyndom Jackson.

13:38.265 --> 13:42.326
You know, now that I think of it, that mysterious
woman yesterday... Orchid, you said her name was.

13:42.403 --> 13:46.703
It was difficult to tell through the black veil,
but she could have been Wyndom Jackson's wife.

13:46.774 --> 13:48.935
Of course, we've never
been properly introduced,

13:49.009 --> 13:52.467
but once at the garden club cotillion when
I chaired the entertainment committee,

13:52.546 --> 13:55.208
she was chairing
the dance committee...

13:57.585 --> 14:00.281
Oh, well. It's not important.

14:10.186 --> 14:13.019
When Christie hired me
to play games with Louise,

14:13.082 --> 14:15.915
she'd conveniently used
her sister's maiden name.

14:15.985 --> 14:20.649
She knew if she told me who Louise was married
to, I wouldn't have anything to do with her.

14:20.723 --> 14:23.191
Even at triple my normal rate.

14:23.259 --> 14:26.751
Wyndom Jackson was notorious
for two things...

14:26.829 --> 14:29.491
his money and his temper.

14:29.565 --> 14:33.365
The first he'd picked up after the war
by investing in property.

14:33.436 --> 14:36.337
The temper I guess he was born with.

14:36.405 --> 14:39.863
He was known as a man
who always got his way,

14:39.942 --> 14:41.876
no matter what it cost...

14:41.944 --> 14:43.969
or who.

14:49.619 --> 14:52.053
Hello? Anybody there?

14:53.890 --> 14:56.654
Hello?

14:56.726 --> 14:58.717
Magnum?

15:03.266 --> 15:05.257
Well, I'm surprised to see you here.

15:05.334 --> 15:07.859
I'll bet you are. Where's Louise?
Out riding.

15:07.937 --> 15:09.996
She won't be back
until after lunch.

15:10.072 --> 15:13.530
Is something wrong? Plenty. Starting
with who your sister really is.

15:13.609 --> 15:16.476
Oh. Apparently that makes
a difference to you.

15:16.546 --> 15:20.607
Uh, married makes a difference. Married to
Wyndom Jackson makes a real big difference.

15:20.683 --> 15:22.844
I can explain that.
Don't bother.

15:22.919 --> 15:24.853
'Cause this is gonna take
about 10 seconds.

15:24.921 --> 15:27.253
I'm off the case.
You can mail me my fee.

15:27.323 --> 15:29.291
For my own curiosity, Magnum,

15:29.358 --> 15:32.020
is it morality or economics?

15:32.094 --> 15:34.619
Are you so angry because
Louise has a husband...

15:34.697 --> 15:37.860
or because he's one of the
Islands' five richest men? Both.

15:37.934 --> 15:42.166
And I sure as hell wouldn't play war games
in an alley with Wyndom Jackson's wife.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.934
Why not, Magnum?
Are you a reverse snob?

15:45.007 --> 15:48.408
No. Because the stakes are too high
with your crowd, and things go wrong.

15:48.477 --> 15:51.640
And people like you don't pay the
bills, and people like me get stuck.

15:51.714 --> 15:54.615
Are you afraid?
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

15:54.684 --> 15:58.313
I'm afraid of hurting my friends
who helped me stage the attack.

15:58.387 --> 16:01.481
What if Jackson finds out and he
doesn't like that particular game?

16:01.557 --> 16:03.616
He'd run them down
without even looking back.

16:03.693 --> 16:07.129
Are you so confident he doesn't know
about Louise's penchant for drama?

16:07.196 --> 16:09.892
Oh, come on. That's the whole
idea of the games, isn't it?

16:09.966 --> 16:12.434
To keep Louise occupied
and out of public trouble?

16:12.501 --> 16:15.527
The spoiled wife of a man
old enough to be her father.

16:15.605 --> 16:17.903
Magnum.

16:19.609 --> 16:21.702
It's not a very original story, is it?

16:21.777 --> 16:23.335
No.

16:23.412 --> 16:26.313
Wyndom worships my sister.

16:26.382 --> 16:29.749
Louise has always been
extremely high-strung and vital.

16:29.819 --> 16:31.753
Lately it's become
like a narcotic.

16:31.821 --> 16:34.255
She needs more and more excitement.

16:34.323 --> 16:36.848
Well, she's bored.
She feels neglected.

16:36.926 --> 16:38.860
And she's becoming reckless.

16:38.928 --> 16:42.056
Magnum, I do apologize.

16:42.131 --> 16:46.966
It's just that I care
very, very much about my sister.

16:47.036 --> 16:49.561
Christie, your sister is not crazy.

16:49.639 --> 16:53.040
She just wants
a little excitement in her life.

16:53.109 --> 16:56.306
Will you keep
that appointment today?

16:58.714 --> 17:00.978
No games.

17:01.050 --> 17:05.749
I'll just talk to her.
And after today, it's finished.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.781
Okay.

17:12.528 --> 17:15.088
I'll try to prepare her.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.859
Frankly, I don't know
how she'll take it.

17:19.568 --> 17:22.537
You just remember no more games.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.503
Whose Ferrari was that?
I damn near hit him.

18:02.578 --> 18:05.911
Oh. Just a friend I met at the club.
Some car, hmm?

18:05.981 --> 18:08.142
Never mind the car.
Who's the driver?

18:08.217 --> 18:11.118
Somebody I do not intend
to let get away.

18:11.187 --> 18:14.645
A friend of yours...
or Louise's?

18:14.724 --> 18:16.988
He's mine.

18:17.059 --> 18:18.993
Come on. Lunch is ready.

18:19.061 --> 18:22.428
And I want to hear all about what
happened at the board meeting.

18:24.834 --> 18:27.166
I know what you're thinking.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.637
I could have just as easily
picked up a phone and laid it out.

18:30.706 --> 18:34.642
I could tell Louise it was over.
No more meetings or games.

18:34.710 --> 18:38.111
I guess I just preferred
to do things one on one.

18:50.593 --> 18:55.997
Hello, Thomas. Tell me,
will it be cold roast beef or...

18:56.065 --> 18:58.761
turkey?

19:09.145 --> 19:11.170
I understand.

19:12.415 --> 19:14.679
I really do understand.

19:16.452 --> 19:20.013
They're going to be here very soon, Thomas.
They want that emerald.

19:20.089 --> 19:22.250
Louise. The Montezuma Emerald.
I know they...

19:22.324 --> 19:24.986
Louise, don't you know?

19:25.060 --> 19:27.528
There aren't gonna be
any bad guys. No games.

19:28.998 --> 19:30.989
What?

19:32.802 --> 19:36.101
This... is good-bye.

19:38.507 --> 19:40.634
Aren't you having a good time?
Louise,

19:40.709 --> 19:43.405
you are going to have to
get a hold of reality.

19:43.479 --> 19:46.915
Don't talk to me about reality.
I have tried it,

19:46.982 --> 19:50.145
and I find it vastly overrated.

19:50.219 --> 19:53.086
Is that why you married Jackson?

19:53.155 --> 19:55.453
When are you going to
learn your lines?

19:55.524 --> 19:57.515
Come on, Louise.

19:58.561 --> 20:00.552
You want reality,

20:01.630 --> 20:04.224
I'll give you reality.

20:05.568 --> 20:10.870
My father was a minister, here in the Islands,
of a very fashionable, fashionable church.

20:12.107 --> 20:15.270
Mind you, that doesn't mean
the pastor has money... just the flock.

20:16.545 --> 20:21.710
But we all became very good at
pretending we had it... had it all.

20:22.718 --> 20:24.913
Especially me.

20:24.987 --> 20:29.651
So I decided then and there that
when I grew up, I was going to be...

20:30.659 --> 20:32.650
an actress.

20:33.729 --> 20:37.256
I was doing such a good job
with the congregation, imagine...

20:37.333 --> 20:40.268
just imagine what I could do
in Hollywood.

20:40.336 --> 20:42.327
What happened?

20:43.739 --> 20:46.435
I met Wyndom.

20:47.643 --> 20:51.101
His wife had just died,
and he was looking for someone.

20:53.415 --> 20:58.284
A companion. Someone to share his
interests, his life. His money?

21:01.023 --> 21:03.821
You are a tough one
when you want to be, Magnum.

21:05.861 --> 21:10.025
Would it make a bit of difference to you if
I told you that the money didn't matter?

21:10.099 --> 21:12.465
Oh, you're gonna tell me
that you really love him...

21:12.535 --> 21:15.197
and you do all this
just to please him.

21:15.271 --> 21:20.402
One day, I was out riding
one of Wyndom's horses.

21:20.476 --> 21:25.038
It started to rain, the horse slipped,
and I ended up on my back for six weeks.

21:25.114 --> 21:28.777
And needless to say,
Wyndom felt very responsible.

21:28.851 --> 21:31.342
So he brought me
into his home and...

21:32.755 --> 21:34.746
he took care of me.

21:36.091 --> 21:40.221
Everybody in these Islands think of
him as a rough, tough son of a gun.

21:40.296 --> 21:42.924
- But not you.
- No, not me.

21:45.334 --> 21:47.325
He brought me my meals.

21:48.337 --> 21:50.464
He would read to me.

21:51.507 --> 21:54.908
And I told him about
wanting to be an actress.

21:54.977 --> 21:57.377
And so we would even play out...

21:57.446 --> 21:59.414
little scenes.

21:59.481 --> 22:01.711
Then eventually we started
writing our own scenes...

22:01.784 --> 22:03.911
or games, if that's what
you want to call them.

22:03.986 --> 22:06.511
Jackson played games?
Oh, he was terrible at it.

22:08.090 --> 22:10.081
So bad, in fact, that...

22:13.362 --> 22:16.331
right before I was getting ready to
leave, he asked me to marry him.

22:16.398 --> 22:18.423
And I thought it was
one of his games.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.195
And you said yes.

22:20.269 --> 22:24.330
And then this rough, tough,
son of a gun started to cry.

22:26.976 --> 22:29.103
No one's ever loved me
like that, Magnum.

22:29.178 --> 22:32.636
I will never, ever
do anything to hurt him.

22:33.649 --> 22:35.583
That's reality.

22:35.651 --> 22:38.984
Some wives drink,
some take lovers.

22:44.426 --> 22:46.417
I play.

22:49.665 --> 22:52.327
Hold it.
You're in trouble, Mr. Magnum.

22:54.470 --> 22:56.870
Ooh!

22:56.939 --> 23:00.375
You just don't give up,
do you, Louise? Hi.

23:05.347 --> 23:09.477
That's it. Do you have any idea what a
windshield costs on a car like that?

23:09.551 --> 23:14.215
Oh, my God. Get a... I am not
paying for that windshield! Get...

23:16.058 --> 23:18.049
No.

23:23.565 --> 23:27.331
Louise, get the car!

23:37.246 --> 23:39.840
Come on. Come on.

23:41.784 --> 23:43.775
Go, go.

23:59.635 --> 24:02.968
- Watch the steps.
- Ooh. Where's the table?

24:03.038 --> 24:05.529
Oh, my gosh. Oh, dear.

24:07.676 --> 24:09.871
Oh. Come on.

24:13.215 --> 24:15.240
Careful, careful, careful, careful.

24:16.385 --> 24:18.512
Poor darling.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.249
Oh, dear.

24:21.323 --> 24:23.689
What can I get you? Anything?
Some ice.

24:23.759 --> 24:25.693
Ice. You have ice.

24:25.761 --> 24:28.161
A towel for the ice.
Towel. Where's the towel?

24:28.230 --> 24:30.164
In the bathroom.
Where's the bathroom?

24:30.232 --> 24:33.963
In the... You go through the door... Shh.
Shh. Don't say another word.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.300
I'll find it.
Don't... Don't move.

24:42.244 --> 24:44.235
Red.

24:46.348 --> 24:48.339
Re... Ow.

24:51.053 --> 24:53.078
Red?

24:54.256 --> 24:57.555
They painted it red!

25:02.564 --> 25:05.192
What have you done
to the Ferrari?

25:06.401 --> 25:09.564
Do you have any idea
what a windscreen costs?

25:09.638 --> 25:13.096
Higgins, the walls are red.

25:13.175 --> 25:15.507
Hot tropical magenta,
to be precise.

25:15.577 --> 25:17.909
Mable Dodge's
trendiest color this season.

25:17.980 --> 25:22.917
You said ""subtle changes."
You said ""imperceptible changes."

25:22.985 --> 25:26.477
Obviously this is not a moment
for rational conversation.

25:26.555 --> 25:30.150
It appears you've been beaten up again.
We'll talk in the morning.

25:31.727 --> 25:34.059
Higgins, you promised!

25:45.474 --> 25:47.465
Red.

25:47.543 --> 25:50.103
Magenta.

25:51.513 --> 25:53.538
Oh. Ooh.

25:54.917 --> 25:56.851
Careful. Careful.

25:56.919 --> 25:58.853
Oh! Ah.

25:58.921 --> 26:01.048
There.

26:01.123 --> 26:04.854
You were wonderful.
You were terrific.

26:04.927 --> 26:09.193
You were so... masterful,
the way you took their punches.

26:09.264 --> 26:11.323
Louise, I got beat up.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.528
Everything they threw at you
and back for more.

26:14.603 --> 26:18.664
Louise, this was not a damn game.
Your hiring them was...

26:18.740 --> 26:22.642
perfect. I didn't hire them.

26:30.619 --> 26:32.917
You don't know how to
play the game. No.

26:32.988 --> 26:36.947
I-If you and your sister didn't hire these
guys, then somebody's after you for real.

26:40.028 --> 26:42.724
Besides, it's too late to be playing.
Good night.

26:42.798 --> 26:45.062
Louise. Oh. Wait.

26:45.133 --> 26:47.260
Now, you listen to me.

26:48.470 --> 26:53.066
If you take one step out of this house, there's
not a damn thing I can do to protect ya.

26:53.141 --> 26:55.541
I'm just too beat.

26:55.611 --> 26:59.604
But I swear to you, if the guys
who are after you don't get ya,

26:59.681 --> 27:04.414
then I'm gonna beat the hell out
of you myself when I catch ya.

27:04.486 --> 27:07.546
You really mean that, don't you?
Every word.

27:15.197 --> 27:17.188
You know, Thomas,

27:19.368 --> 27:21.768
in some ways,
I like this game much better.

27:21.837 --> 27:24.067
That's terrific, sweetheart.

27:24.139 --> 27:27.131
Oh. You were wonderful.

27:27.209 --> 27:29.177
Ah!

27:39.288 --> 27:42.724
Magnum, where do you
keep the coffee?

27:46.461 --> 27:48.452
Magnum.

28:05.948 --> 28:08.610
The marvels of modern technology.

28:13.789 --> 28:16.223
Mmm. Coffee.

28:16.291 --> 28:18.851
Coffee.

28:20.495 --> 28:22.486
Louise.

28:22.564 --> 28:24.828
Oh, good morning, darlings.

28:25.834 --> 28:28.200
Louise.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.397
What have you been
doing here all night?

28:30.472 --> 28:34.067
Taking care of Magnum, of course. Magnum,
would you come out here, please?

28:34.142 --> 28:36.406
Louise, please.

28:39.481 --> 28:42.177
Right now I just want to kill you.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.878
When I find out what went on here
last night, maybe I will.

28:44.953 --> 28:46.887
You're Louise's husband.

28:46.955 --> 28:49.116
Well, before you get too busy
making threats...

28:49.191 --> 28:51.250
I don't feel so well.

28:51.326 --> 28:54.056
Louise, not now.

28:54.129 --> 28:58.930
- I think I'm sick. - Louise, I am trying to make
your husband understand about the guys at the beach.

28:59.001 --> 29:00.764
Jackson.

29:00.836 --> 29:02.770
Louise.

29:06.708 --> 29:09.643
This time she's not acting.
She's really sick.

29:09.711 --> 29:11.736
Call the doctor. Quickly.

29:11.813 --> 29:14.145
Louise, calm down.

29:14.216 --> 29:16.343
Come on. Relax now.

29:16.418 --> 29:18.784
This is an emergency. Calm down.

29:18.854 --> 29:20.845
Come on. Just relax.

29:39.657 --> 29:44.117
How is she? She's out of danger, but
she's feeling pretty uncomfortable.

29:44.195 --> 29:47.460
Wyndom is with her now,
but he'll be out shortly.

29:47.532 --> 29:49.124
And I'd advise you
to be out of here.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.259
No. Not till I find out
what's going on.

29:51.336 --> 29:53.861
It's pretty obvious.
She took poison.

29:53.938 --> 29:58.773
What makes you think she took it?
It's the only logical answer.

29:58.843 --> 30:02.745
Unless you gave it to her. Quite frankly,
I don't think you're the type to do that.

30:02.814 --> 30:05.078
Christie, two guys
beat me up yesterday,

30:05.149 --> 30:07.549
and now your sister
almost dies of poisoning.

30:07.619 --> 30:11.020
Somebody's out to get her.
Come on, Magnum, darling.

30:11.089 --> 30:14.889
You provoked her. You told her you were
no longer playing the game, right?

30:14.959 --> 30:17.086
What's that have to do
with her poisoning?

30:17.161 --> 30:19.391
She took poison,
you saved her and here you are.

30:19.464 --> 30:21.830
The game is still going on.

30:22.901 --> 30:26.769
Oh, come on.
You think she'd risk dying?

30:26.838 --> 30:30.433
She would risk anything to keep
the game going, and you know it.

30:32.577 --> 30:34.841
I'd better go back in.

30:34.913 --> 30:38.280
And, Magnum, I meant it about not
being here when Wyndom comes out.

30:40.518 --> 30:43.316
Dr. Mort Levy,
please report to surgery.

30:43.388 --> 30:46.016
Dr. Mort Levy,
please report to surgery.

30:48.993 --> 30:52.292
What Christie was saying
made sense... in my head.

30:52.363 --> 30:55.264
But in my gut,
it felt all wrong.

30:55.333 --> 30:58.825
I didn't believe Louise would poison
herself and hire those thugs,

30:58.903 --> 31:01.133
but then I was still feeling
a little fuzzy,

31:01.205 --> 31:05.437
so I decided to let the episode rest until
I got some sleep and cleared my head.

31:05.510 --> 31:08.138
I should have known better.

31:29.834 --> 31:31.927
Higgins.

31:32.003 --> 31:34.563
Higgins...

31:34.639 --> 31:37.437
What is that? Ah. Awake, I see.

31:38.943 --> 31:41.138
Why would I be awake?
Stunning, isn't it?

31:41.212 --> 31:43.203
Mable Dodge is mad
for this sculptor.

31:43.281 --> 31:46.478
Reflecting native Hawaiian themes
in a modern idiom.

31:46.551 --> 31:48.542
Higgins, that is terrible.

31:50.355 --> 31:52.289
And I hate that!

31:52.357 --> 31:55.087
Higgins, I want it down.
I want it all down.

31:55.159 --> 31:57.093
I want you and Marble Arch...
Mable Dodge.

31:57.161 --> 31:59.527
Whatever her name is.
I want you and her out.

31:59.597 --> 32:03.363
Since you weren't up to driving today, I
took the liberty of putting it in the shop.

32:08.306 --> 32:10.934
Higgins, this bill is for...
Taking the old windscreen out,

32:11.009 --> 32:13.876
installing the new one,
plus the unit cost itself.

32:15.113 --> 32:17.604
- But this is...
- Simply staggering.

32:18.616 --> 32:21.744
But I can hardly make a claim on
Robin Masters's insurance, can I?

32:28.793 --> 32:33.287
Later that afternoon, a messenger delivered
a letter from Christie firing me...

32:33.364 --> 32:38.301
and enclosing my fee, which, coincidentally,
was almost enough to pay for the windshield.

32:38.369 --> 32:41.133
I'm not saying that Higgins
was eager for the money,

32:41.205 --> 32:44.470
but he did stand over me
while I endorsed the check.

32:49.881 --> 32:51.815
That's what really made me mad.

32:51.883 --> 32:56.582
It's bad enough to be beaten up, but it's downright
humiliating to pay for the damages yourself.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.356
Nurse Barrow, station three, six west.

33:05.430 --> 33:08.627
Nurse Barrow, station three, six west.
Magnum.

33:13.171 --> 33:16.106
I assumed you got my letter.
I did.

33:16.174 --> 33:19.632
There's just, uh,
one little outstanding item.

33:25.049 --> 33:27.779
A windscreen?

33:27.852 --> 33:30.480
It's Louise who plays games,
not me.

33:30.555 --> 33:33.319
Maybe she plays them,
but you seem to pick up the tabs.

33:33.391 --> 33:36.918
By the way, how much
did the guys with the ski masks cost?

33:36.994 --> 33:39.792
I didn't hire those thugs.
Well, somebody sure did.

33:39.864 --> 33:43.994
And if it wasn't you, it had to be Louise. Or
Jackson. One way or another, I'm gonna find out.

33:44.068 --> 33:46.036
We're taking Louise home.

33:46.104 --> 33:48.732
She recovered? That fast?

33:48.806 --> 33:52.742
- The hospital's been upsetting her. - Well,
the poison in the coffee didn't help much.

33:52.810 --> 33:56.644
Magnum, I would never cut you out if I thought
that somebody was poisoning Louise...

33:56.714 --> 33:58.705
other than Louise herself.

33:58.783 --> 34:00.774
What if I don't believe you?

34:00.852 --> 34:03.480
Then I suggest you ask Louise.

34:06.891 --> 34:08.882
Magnum.

34:10.428 --> 34:13.090
Thank you for saving my life.

34:13.164 --> 34:16.827
I meant to thank you before,
but I'm afraid I lost consciousness.

34:17.902 --> 34:22.271
Christie, take Louise down to the car.
No. Wait, please.

34:22.340 --> 34:26.800
Magnum, maybe you think you saved
Louise's life and I should be grateful,

34:26.878 --> 34:31.076
but you're wrong, because I really hold you
responsible for everything that's happened.

34:31.149 --> 34:32.844
Stop it, both of you, please.

34:33.918 --> 34:37.684
You know, I don't know who beat
me up or who's after her or why,

34:37.755 --> 34:39.746
but somebody poisoned her.

34:41.359 --> 34:43.384
I poisoned myself.

34:46.764 --> 34:50.860
I put the poison in the thermos
the night before as part of the game.

34:51.969 --> 34:53.994
To take if you wouldn't continue.

34:56.306 --> 35:00.903
And the next morning, when it was obvious
that you weren't going on with it,

35:00.978 --> 35:03.378
I took it.

35:03.447 --> 35:07.383
But believe me, Magnum, I would
never have let you take any of it.

35:08.753 --> 35:11.085
But I took it.

35:12.123 --> 35:14.114
And I'm ashamed.

35:15.526 --> 35:17.824
Please take me home.

35:27.371 --> 35:29.271
I'm sorry.

35:37.949 --> 35:40.713
You promise to leave
the living room exactly as it is...

35:40.785 --> 35:44.448
and stay away until Mable Dodge
has redecorated the bedroom?

35:44.522 --> 35:47.889
Whatever you want. Now what can you
tell me about the poison she took?

35:49.327 --> 35:52.421
She was very fortunate
to reach the hospital so quickly.

35:53.998 --> 35:57.331
The poison Louise ingested
is particularly vicious,

35:57.401 --> 35:59.596
because unless counteracted quickly,

35:59.670 --> 36:03.333
it's virtually impossible
to reverse its destructive processes.

36:03.407 --> 36:05.773
Like, uh, breathing carbon monoxide.

36:05.843 --> 36:10.007
Even when pure oxygen is administered, the victim's
red blood cells are already so damaged that...

36:10.081 --> 36:12.879
Are you saying
she wasn't kidding about this?

36:12.950 --> 36:15.475
If Louise Jackson swallowed
that poison deliberately,

36:15.553 --> 36:17.544
she was either an ignorant fool...

36:17.622 --> 36:19.647
or a woman determined
to take her own life.

36:30.683 --> 36:34.084
Louise may be a little offbeat,
but she wasn't suicidal.

36:34.154 --> 36:37.555
And death would have been a sure bet
if she'd taken the coffee on schedule.

36:37.624 --> 36:39.717
At the beach,
miles from nowhere.

36:39.792 --> 36:41.726
Too far from any medical attention.

36:41.794 --> 36:45.560
Someone was trying to kill her, and she
was lying to protect whoever it was.

36:45.632 --> 36:48.692
And there could only be
two people for whom she'd do that.

36:48.768 --> 36:50.759
Her husband and her sister.

37:19.966 --> 37:21.957
Hold it. Hold it.

37:23.570 --> 37:25.561
That's enough.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.631
All right, get out.

37:31.644 --> 37:34.477
He works for you.

37:34.547 --> 37:36.538
Not anymore.

37:36.616 --> 37:38.641
You just gave him
his termination notice.

37:38.718 --> 37:42.415
- You sent those guys to beat me up.
- Yes. Yes, I did.

37:42.488 --> 37:45.184
Now just wait one minute.
Do you think you can just admit...

37:45.258 --> 37:48.056
you sent those goons after me
and then just walk away?

37:48.127 --> 37:50.493
I don't believe you people.
You're just incredible.

37:50.563 --> 37:52.758
I didn't mean
to have anything happen to you.

37:52.832 --> 37:56.165
I was just trying to scare you.
I'm sorry they got carried away.

37:56.236 --> 37:58.898
Now, if that's not good
enough for you, we can fight.

37:58.972 --> 38:03.409
You're younger than I am and stronger
maybe, so you'd probably win.

38:03.476 --> 38:07.537
But I'm richer than you are,
so in the end I'll beat you.

38:07.614 --> 38:10.606
Now, why don't you just
accept my apology?

38:16.923 --> 38:18.914
Did you do this
'cause of Louise's game?

38:22.695 --> 38:24.720
I was afraid...

38:25.765 --> 38:29.166
I was afraid she was
beginning to care for you.

38:30.703 --> 38:33.263
And I couldn't stand that, you see.
If she left...

38:33.339 --> 38:35.273
Afraid enough to kill her?

38:38.578 --> 38:41.342
Hey, I love Louise very much.

38:41.414 --> 38:43.439
Maybe I do hold on too tight.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.850
Maybe. But I'd never hurt her.

38:46.919 --> 38:48.944
And I'd never let anything
happen to her.

38:49.022 --> 38:52.321
That's funny.
That's exactly what Christie said.

38:53.960 --> 38:58.192
Christie's a wonderful girl. If it wasn't
for her, I never would have met Louise.

38:58.264 --> 39:01.995
Wait a minute.
Christie introduced you to Louise?

39:02.068 --> 39:04.036
Yes. Christie was my secretary.

39:04.103 --> 39:08.039
She worked in my office in my home.
We were very close.

39:08.107 --> 39:12.840
Louise used to come by and pick her up, and once in
a while she'd take one of my horses out for a ride.

39:12.912 --> 39:15.210
She had an accident.
She told me.

39:15.281 --> 39:18.682
You know, I never met a woman
with such spirit.

39:18.751 --> 39:20.719
I was beginning to feel old.

39:20.787 --> 39:23.449
But when she came
into my home to recover,

39:23.523 --> 39:26.287
suddenly I had a whole new chance.

39:26.359 --> 39:28.884
I could never even
think of her ever leaving.

39:28.961 --> 39:31.794
Mr. Jackson,
she really does care for you.

39:31.864 --> 39:34.162
There's absolutely nothing between us.

39:39.906 --> 39:41.965
Christie and Louise,
where are they?

39:42.041 --> 39:44.635
Gone for a drive, I guess.

39:44.711 --> 39:46.736
Well, where'd they go
for a drive?

39:46.813 --> 39:49.577
Do they have any special spot?
Any favorite spot? Anything?

39:49.649 --> 39:51.810
Not to my knowledge.

39:51.884 --> 39:55.650
- Magnum, what's on your mind?
- Christie poisoned Louise.

39:56.756 --> 39:58.883
Oh, come on.
That was just another game.

39:58.958 --> 40:03.190
It's just another game, Mr. Jackson, but this time
it's Christie's little game. Where can we find 'em?

40:04.263 --> 40:08.097
Well, sometimes they drive out
to the other end of the island.

40:08.167 --> 40:11.295
To an old landing strip.
I still own it. Come on.

40:18.644 --> 40:21.169
Do you think it's going to work, Christie?

40:21.247 --> 40:23.738
It'll be the most exciting
game so far.

40:23.816 --> 40:26.114
I assure you.

40:40.867 --> 40:43.358
You poisoned the coffee,
didn't you, Christie?

40:45.838 --> 40:48.705
I didn't know
if it was you or Wyndom.

40:48.775 --> 40:52.871
You covered for me.
That was noble.

40:52.945 --> 40:56.210
But coming up here with me,
that was stupid.

40:57.450 --> 40:59.941
I had to find out, didn't I?

41:03.623 --> 41:05.557
Why, Christie?

41:06.559 --> 41:08.891
Why?

41:08.961 --> 41:12.226
I love you. I've always tried
to give you everything.

41:12.298 --> 41:14.823
Give? Give?

41:15.902 --> 41:18.097
All you've done
your whole life is take.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.572
You go crashing through life knowing that
somebody's going to look out for you.

41:21.641 --> 41:24.940
That's not true.
It's always been the two of us.

41:25.011 --> 41:27.639
You took Wyndom from me,
didn't you?

41:29.916 --> 41:31.975
Didn't you? Oh.

41:33.052 --> 41:36.488
Oh. Oh, Christie.

41:37.890 --> 41:42.190
Wyndom is very fond of you,
but you are deceiving yourself.

41:42.261 --> 41:46.129
He would have loved me.
It just needed time.

41:46.199 --> 41:50.135
Just a little more time
and he would have loved me.

41:50.203 --> 41:52.967
But you came crashing in,
and you took him from me.

41:53.039 --> 41:56.475
Christie. So
beautiful, so vital,

41:56.542 --> 41:59.033
so much imagination.

41:59.111 --> 42:01.477
Killing me isn't going to
make him love you.

42:01.547 --> 42:04.983
This time you're gonna die
playing one of your little games.

42:05.051 --> 42:09.545
This time the dope dealers are using
real bullets, sister darling!

42:09.622 --> 42:11.613
Christie, come back! No!

42:11.691 --> 42:13.682
Christie!

42:44.457 --> 42:47.858
No! Stop! Stop!

43:13.619 --> 43:16.884
Where is she, Christie? Where's Louise?
Where is she?

43:16.956 --> 43:19.948
She's back in there, Wyndom, playing
another one of her little games.

43:20.026 --> 43:22.756
Another game, Christie?
Like the poison in the coffee?

43:30.570 --> 43:33.164
Louise.

43:33.239 --> 43:35.264
Louise.

43:35.341 --> 43:37.275
Louise.

43:58.931 --> 44:00.922
Take that way.

44:18.918 --> 44:20.909
Hicks!

44:56.288 --> 44:58.222
Oh...

44:59.225 --> 45:01.216
Louise.

45:49.742 --> 45:51.733
Louise.

45:53.879 --> 45:56.245
Jackson?

45:56.315 --> 46:00.411
- Louise.
- Jackson.

46:01.787 --> 46:04.119
Oh, Jackson!
It's all right, Louise.

46:04.190 --> 46:06.181
Jackson!

46:09.195 --> 46:11.186
Hold it!

46:18.871 --> 46:21.066
You're hurt, dear!

46:21.140 --> 46:23.233
He's been hit. You all right?

46:23.309 --> 46:25.436
Okay. You stay with him.
I'm going after Christie.

46:25.511 --> 46:27.536
Wait a minute. Magnum.

46:27.613 --> 46:30.411
Leave her alone. What?

46:30.483 --> 46:33.008
Let me handle this my way.

46:33.085 --> 46:36.953
I have just about had all I can take with
your version of reality... both of you.

46:37.022 --> 46:41.356
You're rich, you're spoiled and you... you try and
twist life around your finger like it was gum.

46:41.427 --> 46:43.918
And she's my sister, Tom.

46:43.996 --> 46:47.124
And no matter what she did,
I can't forget that.

46:47.199 --> 46:50.657
- She's my sister.
- Magnum, please.

46:50.736 --> 46:53.364
Let me settle with...
with Christie.

46:55.474 --> 46:59.808
On one condition.

47:01.814 --> 47:03.679
The games stop.

47:07.219 --> 47:09.312
Okay, I promise.

47:09.388 --> 47:11.856
No more games.

47:11.924 --> 47:13.949
No more games.

47:19.331 --> 47:22.994
It's only for a few days,
until after the photographic session.

47:23.068 --> 47:25.866
Hey, Higgins, no problem.
No problem at all.

47:27.706 --> 47:31.267
Well, I must say you're being very
decent about all this, old boy.

47:33.379 --> 47:35.779
Uh, Magnum...

47:35.848 --> 47:38.146
Look, Higgins,
why should I have a problem?

47:38.217 --> 47:41.778
Jackson and Louise are going to the mainland
for two weeks on a second honeymoon,

47:41.854 --> 47:44.220
and they've hired me
to stay at their house.

47:44.290 --> 47:46.815
It's a security check.
I'm sure you know about that.

47:56.535 --> 47:59.197
It's a wonderful place, Higgins.
Thirty rooms.

47:59.271 --> 48:01.330
A staff of six.

48:01.407 --> 48:05.241
Oh, did I tell you
about Jackson's yacht?

48:05.311 --> 48:06.835
They hired you?

48:08.681 --> 48:12.742
Now let's get this straight, Higgins.
I want fresh, white paint on the walls...

48:12.818 --> 48:15.309
and the furniture cleaned
because of dirt from storage.

48:17.957 --> 48:22.553
I'll see you around, Higgins. Give my
love to Mable Dodge, whoever she may be.

48:35.741 --> 48:37.675
Are you Mable Dodge?

48:42.014 --> 48:44.676
Yes, Magnum.

48:44.750 --> 48:46.877
This is Mable Dodge.

48:48.687 --> 48:51.679
She of the magenta walls.

48:56.662 --> 48:59.153
I love your work.
