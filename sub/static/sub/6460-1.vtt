WEBVTT

00:04.059 --> 00:05.967
Max, the guy is coming right now.

00:05.968 --> 00:09.145
That's the first time anyone's ever been
polite enough to announce that to me.

00:10.265 --> 00:12.034
Yeah, hilarious, sex is messy.

00:12.035 --> 00:13.005
Now hurry!

00:13.006 --> 00:15.480
Let's get these cupcakes to the
window before that guy gets here,

00:15.481 --> 00:18.350
and when he does, Max,
don't turn around.

00:18.421 --> 00:19.068
Why?

00:19.069 --> 00:20.771
You know why.

00:24.948 --> 00:32.455

Sub Upload Date: November 13, 2015</font></b>

00:35.154 --> 00:37.049
And here we are on the much traveled

00:37.050 --> 00:39.301
Bedford Street right in the very heart

00:39.302 --> 00:41.489
of historic Williamsburg.

00:41.490 --> 00:43.642
This guy is so boring.

00:43.643 --> 00:47.387
He's like a roofy with a little flag.

00:47.388 --> 00:50.666
During the 1830s, German
and Austrian capitalists

00:50.667 --> 00:52.489
established their businesses

00:52.490 --> 00:55.340
here in historic Williamsburg Brooklyn.

00:55.341 --> 00:57.427
And, in honor of those
German and Austrian

00:57.428 --> 01:00.110
founding fathers, here we have our

01:00.111 --> 01:02.861
Williamsburg beer-batter cupcake.

01:02.862 --> 01:07.633
Oof-yah, beer batter! It's good!

01:07.634 --> 01:09.851
Wow, you're pushing harder than I was

01:09.852 --> 01:13.131
after I ate that whole brick of cheese.

01:14.756 --> 01:17.540
Soon, docks, shipyards,
refineries, mills,

01:17.541 --> 01:19.825
and other booming businesses opened

01:19.826 --> 01:21.350
along the growing waterfront.

01:21.351 --> 01:24.166
Businesses just like
Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.154
See, made in Williamsburg.

01:26.155 --> 01:28.442
Only 12.95, 100% cotton.

01:28.443 --> 01:34.636
And I'm guessing cotton oof-ya, ees good!

01:34.637 --> 01:39.408
Actually, I was referencing
booming Williamsburg businesses.

01:39.409 --> 01:42.092
This is one of those small
Williamsburg businesses

01:42.093 --> 01:44.345
that won't be here much longer.

01:44.346 --> 01:46.962
Follow me.

01:46.963 --> 01:51.270
Oh, sir, no, a free dessert
comes with your end-of-tour meal

01:51.271 --> 01:54.649
at the Ye Olde Williamsburg
Watering Hole Restaurant.

01:54.650 --> 01:57.068
Don't waste your Euros.

01:59.918 --> 02:03.132
How dare he tell those people
our business won't be here.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.889
I haven't been this speechless
since the first time

02:04.890 --> 02:07.076
I saw your toe nails.

02:07.077 --> 02:09.362
Who cares what he thinks?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.117
We had such a good
month, I had enough cash

02:11.118 --> 02:13.901
to buy my own box of S'mores Pop-Tarts,

02:13.902 --> 02:16.751
a goal I've had since I was 11.

02:16.752 --> 02:19.269
My other goal was making it to 12.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.463
By the way, you heard I referenced

02:20.464 --> 02:23.577
the Pop-Tarts as "my own box," right?

02:23.578 --> 02:25.730
Max, I'm not interested in your box.

02:25.731 --> 02:29.859
Well, not for another ten
years when we're still single.

02:39.055 --> 02:40.926
I can't believe that tour guide

02:40.927 --> 02:42.517
is telling people that
our cupcake business

02:42.518 --> 02:43.942
is gonna fail.

02:43.943 --> 02:45.777
I mean, it's one thing for you, me,

02:45.778 --> 02:48.824
and Time Out New York to say it, but...

02:48.825 --> 02:51.045
I just hate that tour guy.

02:51.046 --> 02:54.292
I hate that tour guy too!

02:54.293 --> 02:55.849
Han, oh, my God!

02:55.850 --> 02:57.969
It took us five years, but
we finally have something

02:57.970 --> 03:00.057
in common.

03:00.058 --> 03:04.530
That's not true.
Aren't you both an A-cup?

03:04.531 --> 03:06.187
Can you believe he's
telling his entire tour

03:06.188 --> 03:08.143
that our cupcake business is gonna fail?

03:08.144 --> 03:10.064
Just to play devil's
advocate, maybe he has

03:10.065 --> 03:13.409
the most basic understanding
of supply and demand.

03:17.188 --> 03:19.011
Han, don't blow this, it
might be our only connection

03:19.011 --> 03:20.434
ever.

03:20.435 --> 03:23.251
Who the hell does that
dickweed think he is?

03:23.252 --> 03:24.643
Exactly.

03:24.644 --> 03:26.001
And I hate him because
that tour never eats

03:26.002 --> 03:27.328
in here.

03:27.329 --> 03:28.884
He just keeps pushing his stupid

03:28.885 --> 03:30.972
Ye Olde Williamsburg Watering Hole.

03:30.973 --> 03:33.988
I don't want to hear anymore
about that guy's hole!

03:33.989 --> 03:37.167
Until ten years from now
when you're still single.

03:38.196 --> 03:40.481
Hey, everybody!

03:44.357 --> 03:45.981
Well, it happened.

03:45.982 --> 03:49.593
Ryan Seacrest came out?

03:49.594 --> 03:52.939
Oh, Max, don't be silly.

03:52.940 --> 03:54.696
No, I'm pretty sure that happened

03:54.697 --> 03:57.114
a couple of years ago.

03:57.115 --> 03:59.898
My biggest dream has come true.

03:59.899 --> 04:01.289
Kentucky Fried Chicken now comes

04:01.290 --> 04:03.344
with free hair extensions?

04:03.345 --> 04:08.016
Okay, my second biggest dream.

04:08.017 --> 04:10.105
I'm pregnant.

04:10.105 --> 04:11.694
Oh, no everyone just thinks that

04:11.695 --> 04:14.710
after they'd had the
chicken Parmesan here.

04:14.711 --> 04:17.459
It's not official. I haven't
peed on a stick yet,

04:17.461 --> 04:20.574
but my boobs are really, really sore.

04:21.601 --> 04:24.351
That could be my handy-work, baby.

04:24.352 --> 04:27.598
Well, we're about to find out in a minute

04:27.600 --> 04:31.576
'cause I'm about to go
pee like a race whore.

04:31.576 --> 04:34.126
Sophie, the phrase is "race horse."

04:34.127 --> 04:37.872
Uh, not in Poland.

04:37.873 --> 04:39.991
See, I got a whole bunch of these things

04:39.992 --> 04:43.372
'cause, uh, my aim isn't very good.

04:43.373 --> 04:45.823
Yeah, I have what the doctors call

04:45.824 --> 04:50.262
"a forked stream."

04:50.263 --> 04:53.443
Well, whichever of those
you don't use, I'll take.

04:53.444 --> 04:54.900
It'll be nice not to throw myself

04:54.901 --> 04:56.923
down a flight of stairs
every time I have a hunch.

04:56.924 --> 04:58.844
Oh, all right, well.

04:58.845 --> 05:00.138
Wish me luck, girls.

05:00.139 --> 05:02.390
Oh, wait up, Sophie!

05:02.391 --> 05:05.638
I'll hold the stick under
you while you urinate.

05:05.639 --> 05:10.872
Oleg, you're gonna make a great father.

05:15.677 --> 05:19.356
Is it even possible for
Sophie to have a baby?

05:19.357 --> 05:21.211
I mean, didn't that window
close around the same time

05:21.212 --> 05:23.827
Blockbuster Video did?

05:25.088 --> 05:28.069
Well, we don't know how old she is.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.555
Sophie's ageless, like a unicorn

05:30.556 --> 05:33.470
or... Anderson Cooper.

05:34.730 --> 05:36.353
Caroline, I found a city website

05:36.354 --> 05:38.640
where we can complain
about that tour guide.

05:38.641 --> 05:40.031
Why, what'd he do to you?

05:40.032 --> 05:41.755
Confuse you with a historic Williamsburg

05:41.756 --> 05:43.809
fire hydrant?

05:43.810 --> 05:46.692
Up top!

05:46.693 --> 05:48.215
Um, things have changed.

05:48.216 --> 05:49.673
I'm kind of all about the
Han and me connection

05:49.674 --> 05:51.827
right now.

05:51.828 --> 05:54.775
Sorry, Max, you're out.

05:54.776 --> 05:56.565
Han, complaining online doesn't work.

05:56.566 --> 05:57.924
True, if it did, they would have replaced

05:57.925 --> 06:00.210
my faulty Legos by now.

06:00.211 --> 06:02.961
I say we gotta find him and
knock some sense into him.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.617
I'm in.

06:04.618 --> 06:08.659
That's the first time Han has
ever said that to a woman.

06:10.117 --> 06:12.502
All right, can I just come?

06:20.158 --> 06:22.411
That tour guide keeps going on and on

06:22.412 --> 06:25.128
into his mic in front of
that bunch of Euro trash.

06:25.129 --> 06:27.646
It's like Madonna on tour.

06:27.647 --> 06:30.163
Forget this Ye Olde Williamsburg place.

06:30.164 --> 06:32.682
Those people should be
having desserts at my diner!

06:32.683 --> 06:35.068
Yeah, if they wanted Ye Olde Desserts,

06:35.069 --> 06:36.924
they should have come to us.

06:36.925 --> 06:39.409
We've got lady fingers so
old, they have arthritis.

06:39.410 --> 06:41.728
Ooh, okay, here he comes. Get ready!

06:41.729 --> 06:44.379
Oh, who am I kidding? I can't do this!

06:44.380 --> 06:47.196
I'm not a violent person,
and full disclosure,

06:47.197 --> 06:49.316
this is a Nerf bat.

06:49.317 --> 06:51.072
Sorry, Caroline, I hope
this doesn't affect

06:51.073 --> 06:52.894
our budding friendship/ you never know,

06:52.895 --> 06:55.644
possible romance.

06:55.645 --> 06:57.565
Never gonna happen.

06:57.566 --> 06:59.687
Okay, Han's dead to me.
It's back to me and you.

06:59.688 --> 07:01.641
Thank God. Those couple
of hours were hell.

07:01.642 --> 07:03.961
For me too.

07:03.962 --> 07:05.750
Hi, we need to talk to you.

07:05.751 --> 07:07.905
I'm Caroline from Max's
Homemade Cupcakes.

07:07.906 --> 07:10.057
Oh, yeah, right.

07:10.058 --> 07:11.946
I didn't recognize you without...

07:11.947 --> 07:15.724
the worst German accent I ever heard.

07:15.725 --> 07:17.148
And you are?

07:17.149 --> 07:18.540
Dannon.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.860
Like the yogurt?

07:20.861 --> 07:22.350
It's a family name.

07:22.351 --> 07:24.604
Listen, Yoplait.

07:24.605 --> 07:26.758
I personally don't give
a crap what you think,

07:26.759 --> 07:28.515
but you bad-mouthing our business

07:28.516 --> 07:30.436
is upsetting my girl here.

07:30.437 --> 07:32.690
You got that, Activia?

07:32.691 --> 07:36.466
Look, girls, I'm not just
talking about your business.

07:36.467 --> 07:38.620
All the businesses on that
block are gonna close.

07:38.621 --> 07:41.601
It's getting plowed for an IMAX theatre.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.313
Oh, my God.

07:45.314 --> 07:46.672
I know.

07:46.673 --> 07:50.448
Another Max is getting
plowed on our block?

07:57.955 --> 07:59.783
- Morning.
- Yeah.

07:59.784 --> 08:01.313
I can't believe they're replacing us

08:01.314 --> 08:02.274
with an IMAX.

08:02.275 --> 08:05.289
That subway psychic told me
my business would skyrocket.

08:05.290 --> 08:07.585
I guess this also means
I won't be a contestant

08:07.586 --> 08:08.985
on "The Voice."

08:09.740 --> 08:12.986
That psychic had food
all down her blouse.

08:12.987 --> 08:14.510
She couldn't predict her mouth opening,

08:14.511 --> 08:16.564
let alone your life.

08:16.565 --> 08:18.553
I'm e-mailing all the
neighborhood business owners

08:18.554 --> 08:21.137
to attend an emergency meeting
tonight at the diner.

08:21.138 --> 08:22.330
I've contacted pretty much everyone

08:22.331 --> 08:24.318
except that medical marijuana store.

08:24.319 --> 08:26.656
You know, Joint Custody.

08:27.582 --> 08:30.272
I'll call them, they're on my speed dial.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.203
â™ª Pa-boppa boppa-tarts... â™ª

08:42.498 --> 08:45.810
(KEYS CLACKING)

08:50.523 --> 08:53.174
Yes, it was me. I stress ate them.

08:53.175 --> 08:56.850
You ate my PPTs?

08:56.851 --> 08:59.666
Personal Pop-Tarts.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.422
You gave them a cute name?

09:01.423 --> 09:04.372
Of course, I've been dreaming
about them my whole life.

09:04.373 --> 09:08.447
I can't believe you ate the
last of my S'mores Pop-Tarts.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.437
Fine, I'll go out and
buy you another box

09:10.438 --> 09:13.649
with the money I was saving
for a Wet n Wild lip liner.

09:13.650 --> 09:15.340
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

09:15.341 --> 09:17.328
Well, we know that's not
opportunity knocking.

09:17.329 --> 09:20.077
He lost my address when I moved in here.

09:22.397 --> 09:24.088
Hi, girls.

09:24.089 --> 09:26.141
I'm out of sugar, and can one of you read

09:26.142 --> 09:29.190
my morning pee stick?

09:29.191 --> 09:31.311
I can't read this little window thing

09:31.312 --> 09:35.155
and I lost my cheaters
and Oleg's not upstairs.

09:35.155 --> 09:38.600
So you lost both your cheaters.

09:38.601 --> 09:40.887
Yeah, see Max?

09:40.888 --> 09:43.074
That kind of joke is no longer funny

09:43.075 --> 09:45.227
now that we're gonna be parents.

09:45.228 --> 09:48.142
So no more that!

09:53.611 --> 09:56.162
It's just not my morning.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.679
Caroline, why don't you read it?

09:58.680 --> 10:00.171
Might be nice to here some good news

10:00.172 --> 10:03.482
come out of your sad mouth for a change.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.725
Oh, just take it.

10:07.726 --> 10:11.039
I'm pretty sure I got the worst of it.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.782
Okay, now everybody hold
hands and get ready to cry

10:14.783 --> 10:20.019
'cause I feel really,
really, really pregnant.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.277
It's negative.

10:21.278 --> 10:24.392
You're negative!

10:24.393 --> 10:26.512
Sophie, I understand you're disappointed,

10:26.513 --> 10:29.594
but maybe you should
manage your expectations.

10:29.595 --> 10:33.437
Oh, man I really thought I was pregnant.

10:33.438 --> 10:36.453
I mean, my period's real late.

10:40.795 --> 10:43.578
How late is late?

10:43.579 --> 10:47.455
Hashtag, just asking for a friend.

10:47.456 --> 10:49.940
Well, I don't know.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.890
Six months?

10:52.891 --> 10:55.607
A year, tops.

10:55.607 --> 10:58.581
- Well, I mean, at your age...
- Oh, careful now.

11:00.047 --> 11:02.939
Don't be too dead to
get my new Pop-Tarts.

11:03.558 --> 11:06.620
Exactly how old do you think I am?

11:07.038 --> 11:08.362
Well...

11:08.363 --> 11:10.249
If you open your mouth and say an age,

11:10.250 --> 11:14.127
any age, there's no
coming back from that.

11:14.128 --> 11:17.280
How old?

11:18.270 --> 11:20.554
Well...

11:25.989 --> 11:28.241
Oh.

11:33.842 --> 11:36.294
- (SCOFFS)
- (LAUGHS)

11:36.295 --> 11:39.442
Final offer.

11:39.443 --> 11:41.066
Well, I don't know how old she is,

11:41.067 --> 11:44.047
but I've aged since this started.

11:47.362 --> 11:50.775
Okay, next, Cathy's Crystal Shop.

11:50.776 --> 11:54.916
Present and accounted for,
thank the goddess.

11:54.917 --> 11:57.401
Garboni Funeral Home?

11:57.402 --> 12:00.183
Thanks for coming.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.511
No thanks, I'm having my head frozen.

12:07.972 --> 12:10.920
Bedford Methadone and Drug Clinic?

12:10.921 --> 12:12.476
Oh.

12:12.477 --> 12:14.568
Do you have a card?

12:17.613 --> 12:19.105
We'll just wait for one
more business to arrive

12:19.106 --> 12:20.297
before we start.

12:20.298 --> 12:21.954
Oh, and thank you all for coming.

12:21.955 --> 12:23.478
Oh, and thank you

12:23.479 --> 12:26.726
for closing the diner
tonight for this meeting.

12:26.727 --> 12:29.642
Oh, we're not closed.

12:29.643 --> 12:32.490
Nope, this is a busy Thursday for us.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.838
Oh, hi, are you here for the meeting?

12:35.839 --> 12:39.085
Yeah, we're Smiley Time Daycare.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.988
Well, if Sophie has a baby,
I think we found our nanny.

12:44.849 --> 12:47.732
Okay, tonight's call to arms

12:47.733 --> 12:49.689
is really about each and every one of us

12:49.690 --> 12:51.477
and our dreams.

12:51.478 --> 12:53.962
Small businesses are
and have always been

12:53.963 --> 12:55.785
the backbone of Williamsburg.

12:55.786 --> 12:59.363
But this is about so
much more than business.

12:59.364 --> 13:00.589
Let me help.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.478
I took a class in motivational speaking.

13:02.479 --> 13:03.936
Well motivate your ass back down.

13:03.937 --> 13:06.189
I got this.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.646
Do you? You're losing this crowd

13:07.647 --> 13:10.495
faster than I'm going to lose my diner.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.054
He's right, move it along.

13:12.055 --> 13:14.240
You make that boring crock guy
look like a sweeps episode

13:14.241 --> 13:15.632
of "Empire."

13:15.633 --> 13:17.090
That was just my opening.

13:17.091 --> 13:20.536
And your closing. Thanks, Caroline.

13:23.154 --> 13:27.031
Yes, I said yes, folks.

13:27.032 --> 13:29.249
Yes, we are all businesses,

13:29.250 --> 13:32.365
but we are one hell of
a lot more than that!

13:32.366 --> 13:34.453
Impressive. It's like Tony Robbins

13:34.454 --> 13:38.264
and a pine nut had a baby.

13:38.264 --> 13:40.648
We are a family,

13:40.649 --> 13:43.300
and the only way...
the only way out of this crap

13:43.301 --> 13:44.659
is each other.

13:44.660 --> 13:45.917
Can I get a "what-what?"

13:45.918 --> 13:46.977
ALL: What-what!

13:46.978 --> 13:48.237
Can I get a high-five?

13:48.238 --> 13:49.794
ALL: High-five!

13:49.795 --> 13:51.649
- All right!
- High-five!

13:55.163 --> 13:56.422
I'm so jealous.

13:56.423 --> 13:59.138
I've been dying to do that for years.

14:00.629 --> 14:04.010
And tomorrow, we need you,

14:04.011 --> 14:07.157
and I mean every one of you,

14:07.158 --> 14:10.304
to join my diner family
at that public hearing

14:10.305 --> 14:12.391
down at the Brooklyn Courthouse

14:12.392 --> 14:14.213
and we are going to tell them

14:14.214 --> 14:16.633
they can keep their
stinking buyout money.

14:16.634 --> 14:18.125
Yeah!

14:18.126 --> 14:19.582
There isn't enough money in the world

14:19.583 --> 14:23.259
- to buyout our leases.
- Yeah.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.115
- Han, I don't...
- Wait, they want to buy us out?

14:25.116 --> 14:27.964
Not 20,000, not 30,000...

14:27.965 --> 14:30.649
Dollars? I could live in India.

14:30.650 --> 14:34.194
I wouldn't have to sell
these dumb crystals anymore.

14:34.195 --> 14:36.414
But we are a family!

14:36.415 --> 14:39.296
Yeah, we're a family.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.904
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

14:43.905 --> 14:46.321
Might just be us tomorrow.

14:54.892 --> 14:56.780
With the addition of the IMAX,

14:56.781 --> 14:58.802
I predict that the net worth

14:58.803 --> 15:01.982
of this now dilapidated
group of businesses

15:01.983 --> 15:03.772
will at least quadruple.

15:03.773 --> 15:05.760
And commissioner, you don't know me,

15:05.761 --> 15:07.019
but when it comes to finance,

15:07.020 --> 15:10.199
when it comes to most things really,

15:10.200 --> 15:12.848
I'm very hands on.

15:14.672 --> 15:18.349
And also a douche.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.334
We'll take a break and
then hear arguments

15:20.335 --> 15:22.355
from the opposing side.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.442
Max, I'm gonna ask you
a serious question

15:24.443 --> 15:26.132
and I want the truth.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.617
Is it, "Can you smell
that onion bagel on my breath,"

15:28.618 --> 15:31.268
'cause yes.

15:31.269 --> 15:33.090
Do you think our business dream

15:33.091 --> 15:35.376
is as far-fetched as Sophie's baby dream?

15:35.377 --> 15:38.226
You know Sophie's right there, right?

15:38.227 --> 15:39.784
Don't get her mad.

15:39.785 --> 15:42.136
I once saw her open up a can of paint

15:42.137 --> 15:45.448
with her knees.

15:45.449 --> 15:48.431
I mean, aren't all dreams kind of crazy?

15:48.432 --> 15:49.989
Isn't that why they're called dreams,

15:49.990 --> 15:52.010
'cause they're not real?

15:52.011 --> 15:55.158
At some point, you have to
wake up and pee, right?

15:55.159 --> 15:59.863
Sometimes five times a night.

15:59.864 --> 16:02.315
Well, at least you won't have
to listen to that annoying

16:02.316 --> 16:05.330
tour guide's speech twice a day anymore.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.485
Right, if you look to your left,

16:07.486 --> 16:09.041
you'll see a failing cupcake shop

16:09.042 --> 16:12.322
with two completely
deluded shop owners.

16:12.323 --> 16:14.608
In fact, the only redeeming feature

16:14.609 --> 16:17.788
in this waste of architecture are
the historic Tiffany windows

16:17.789 --> 16:22.062
right next to those two bitches.

16:22.063 --> 16:23.786
He says that? I totally missed that?

16:23.787 --> 16:27.663
Yeah, because you're too
busy sprechen the cupcakes.

16:27.664 --> 16:30.015
Oh, my God, those Tiffany windows

16:30.016 --> 16:31.341
might be old enough to qualify us

16:31.342 --> 16:33.394
as a historic landmark building.

16:33.395 --> 16:35.284
Oh, oh, my God, I'll be right back.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.576
Where are you going?

16:36.577 --> 16:37.802
Down to the city archives.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.658
I need proof that those
windows are legit.

16:39.659 --> 16:41.480
If I'm not back when
it's our turn to speak,

16:41.481 --> 16:43.170
stall them. Fill time.

16:43.171 --> 16:44.893
Just go on an on talking about nothing.

16:44.894 --> 16:47.378
Got it. Pretend I'm you.

16:47.379 --> 16:50.891
But you would need a miracle
to find that proof in time.

16:50.892 --> 16:53.774
Psst, Max, you got a tampon?

16:53.775 --> 16:55.695
I just got my period.

16:55.696 --> 16:59.140
Either that, or I've been shot.

17:00.698 --> 17:02.256
Sophie can still have a baby!

17:02.257 --> 17:04.443
See, miracles can happen!

17:04.444 --> 17:07.223
The woman is right there.

17:09.910 --> 17:12.726
And like I've already
said twice, Your Honor,

17:12.727 --> 17:16.438
I've worked at that diner since 1989,

17:16.439 --> 17:19.119
so, peace out.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.009
She's still not back. Keep going.

17:21.010 --> 17:23.395
Your Honor, I've been
working at that diner

17:23.396 --> 17:25.814
since 1989.

17:25.815 --> 17:28.431
I think we've heard everything
this gentlemen has to say

17:28.432 --> 17:31.447
about the building in question,
including, for some reason,

17:31.448 --> 17:36.053
of his brief affair with
comedian Nipsy Russell's wife.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.411
She was from Brooklyn!

17:37.412 --> 17:40.426
I thought it was pertinent, Your Honor.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.851
If there are no other witnesses...

17:41.852 --> 17:43.011
Han, go, go, go, go.

17:43.012 --> 17:45.231
No, I already blew this once.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.821
Finally, you admit you blew something

17:46.822 --> 17:49.107
when I can't enjoy it.

17:49.108 --> 17:50.500
Oleg, you go.

17:50.501 --> 17:52.289
I can't. The judge knows me

17:52.290 --> 17:55.966
from a sort of "Eyes
Wide Shut" situation.

17:56.928 --> 17:58.254
You go.

17:58.255 --> 18:00.141
No, nothing good ever happened to me

18:00.142 --> 18:01.831
in a courtroom.

18:01.832 --> 18:05.178
Every single time, they just
gave me back to my mother.

18:05.179 --> 18:06.802
I'll go.

18:06.803 --> 18:08.691
Yeah, I've got something to say.

18:08.692 --> 18:10.480
You're a lady judge.

18:10.481 --> 18:13.429
You got any Midol?

18:13.430 --> 18:15.352
Well, if there are no
further witnesses...

18:15.353 --> 18:16.874
Damn it, yo!

18:16.875 --> 18:19.029
I guess I have something to say.

18:19.030 --> 18:21.016
Wonderful.

18:21.017 --> 18:24.130
Carmella, we just lost our lunch table.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.543
Nice model you got there,

18:27.544 --> 18:30.459
except IMAXs are supposed to be big.

18:30.460 --> 18:34.204
(LAUGHS) That's kind of the point.

18:34.205 --> 18:36.988
Miss, if you don't have
anything pertinent...

18:36.989 --> 18:39.672
Stop, you can't tear our building down!

18:39.673 --> 18:42.751
So excited, I feel like
I'm in "Legally Blonde."

18:44.112 --> 18:46.398
Those Tiffany windows
are over 100 years old,

18:46.399 --> 18:48.982
making it a historic, landmark building.

18:48.983 --> 18:50.772
Do you have documented proof of this?

18:50.773 --> 18:52.594
Yes, I do, your honor.

18:52.595 --> 18:55.112
So dramatic. I'm loving it.

18:55.113 --> 18:58.094
Living, breathing, boring proof.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.745
Your Honor, this gentlemen is an expert

19:00.746 --> 19:02.269
on historic Williamsburg.

19:02.270 --> 19:04.191
Dannon, tell them about the windows.

19:04.192 --> 19:05.781
First say it.

19:05.782 --> 19:08.268
Say it in the eyes of
the court, or no deal.

19:08.269 --> 19:11.448
I will never do a German accent again.

19:11.449 --> 19:13.801
The building's windows were
created by Tiffany Studios

19:13.802 --> 19:16.187
in a playful fish motif for
the original Williamsburg

19:16.188 --> 19:18.141
fish market, opened at that location

19:18.142 --> 19:20.526
in June, 1901.

19:20.528 --> 19:22.481
Well, that qualifies as a landmark.

19:22.482 --> 19:23.972
Yes!

19:23.973 --> 19:27.185
Yah, dis is vuunderbar!

19:30.335 --> 19:33.116
Well, I never promised you anything.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.363
How do you like that, Max?

19:36.364 --> 19:38.055
These cute little fishies
from the fish market

19:38.056 --> 19:40.241
saved our business and the diner.

19:40.242 --> 19:42.661
It's weird I'd wind up working
in a former fish market.

19:42.662 --> 19:44.583
Dannon told me the
market was also a front

19:44.584 --> 19:46.272
for a whore house.

19:46.273 --> 19:48.360
Yeah, that's more like it.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.314
Now I have a serious question for you

19:50.315 --> 19:52.270
and I want you to tell me the truth.

19:52.271 --> 19:54.091
Would it have been smarter for us

19:54.092 --> 19:55.451
to take whatever of that buyout money

19:55.452 --> 19:59.095
we would have forced Han
to give us and quit?

19:59.096 --> 20:01.448
Probably.

20:01.449 --> 20:02.708
But Max, I've wanted my own business

20:02.709 --> 20:04.397
since I was little.

20:04.398 --> 20:05.790
It's purely emotional.

20:05.791 --> 20:07.478
I can't really explain it.

20:07.479 --> 20:10.129
I can. It's your PPT.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.747
Your personal Pop-Tart.

20:12.748 --> 20:15.829
It is. It's my PPT.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.214
Then I totally get it.

20:18.215 --> 20:21.626
Yeah, you do, Max. You always do.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.277
Well, girls, it's official.

20:24.278 --> 20:25.934
You're still short?

20:25.935 --> 20:27.326
We won!

20:27.327 --> 20:29.379
The entire neighborhood
has just been notified

20:29.380 --> 20:31.700
there is no IMAX buyout.

20:31.701 --> 20:34.151
Yep, and they do not look happy.

20:34.152 --> 20:35.377
Here they come.

20:35.378 --> 20:38.491
Hey, you! Yeah, you!

20:38.492 --> 20:41.607
(CROWD CHATTERING)

20:41.608 --> 20:45.351
- Open up!
- They have sticks!

20:45.352 --> 20:47.835
Can't leave him out there, can we?

20:49.459 --> 20:51.117
- Aah!
- Oh, God!

20:51.118 --> 20:53.435
Oh!
