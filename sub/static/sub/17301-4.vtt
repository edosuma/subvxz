<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

00:01.799 --> 00:06.219
Tonight - an MP
in our reasonably priced car.

00:06.219 --> 00:10.889
A nice relaxing smoke
in a new Aston Martin.

00:10.889 --> 00:14.199
And a mad Jag gone bad.

00:18.169 --> 00:21.079
Hello. We have a Jaguar theme.

00:21.079 --> 00:23.999
Later, I'll look at the new XJ.

00:23.999 --> 00:26.929
Look what we have in the hangar.

00:26.929 --> 00:30.839
The R Coupe.
It's the only one in the world.

00:30.839 --> 00:35.439
Have you ever seen such
a beautiful car? AUDIENCE: No!

00:35.439 --> 00:39.969
Neither have I.
But it isn't actually a car.

00:39.969 --> 00:42.879
It's a one-off, a flight of fancy.

00:42.879 --> 00:47.089
Jaguar built it to show
where they're going.

00:47.089 --> 00:51.241
We start tonight
with where they came from.

00:54.329 --> 00:57.359
1953 - a top year to be British.

00:57.359 --> 01:02.969
We climbed Everest and raced
this Jaguar C-Type at Le Mans.

01:02.969 --> 01:07.329
This was the first car
to lap the Le Mans circuit

01:07.329 --> 01:10.173
at an average speed of over 100mph.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.649
Interestingly, the bloke driving

01:16.649 --> 01:19.439
was totally and utterly...

01:19.439 --> 01:22.649
TYRES SCREECH

01:22.649 --> 01:25.839
.. drunk!

01:25.839 --> 01:29.209
Steady!
'His name was Duncan Hamilton.

01:29.209 --> 01:36.217
'He and co-driver Tony Rolt
qualified for Le Mans OK, but were
disqualified on a technicality. '

01:37.889 --> 01:41.889
A-a-a-argh!

01:41.889 --> 01:44.769
Hamilton went to a local bar

01:44.769 --> 01:48.039
and got hog-whimperingly bladdered.

01:48.039 --> 01:51.529
The race organisers decided
he could race.

01:51.529 --> 01:57.309
We have the lariest car at the
start of the most gruelling race.

01:57.309 --> 02:01.819
At the wheel, the most plastered
driver. Guess what happened?

02:01.819 --> 02:04.094
He won.

02:09.489 --> 02:15.974
This set the tone for Jaguar -
cars for rotters, cads, bounders.

02:21.049 --> 02:24.069
It's my favourite racing story.

02:24.069 --> 02:29.029
My favourite part is, at the first
few pitstops to refuel the car,

02:29.029 --> 02:32.869
they gave Duncan Hamilton
black coffee.

02:32.869 --> 02:37.479
He said, "No! It's making me
jittery! " So they gave him brandy!

02:37.479 --> 02:41.789
Fill the car with fuel
and him with brandy!

02:41.789 --> 02:47.629
Later - there's no windscreen
on the car - 130mph, bird, boof!

02:47.629 --> 02:53.229
He never noticed! It was hanging
in tatters - "No, not giving up! "

02:53.229 --> 02:58.779
Jaguar continued in that spirit
because in the '60s they had this.

02:58.779 --> 03:03.189
The Mark 2 - glamorous enough
for David Bailey,

03:03.189 --> 03:08.980
genteel enough for Inspector Morse,
fast enough for London's villains.

03:10.309 --> 03:14.409
Let me show you one feature,

03:14.409 --> 03:21.249
one little detail that sums up the
impact the Mark 2 had when it came

03:21.249 --> 03:23.689
in 1959.

03:23.689 --> 03:28.749
I don't mean the beautiful grille,
that long bonnet

03:28.749 --> 03:31.549
or the wire wheels.

03:31.549 --> 03:33.579
It's back here.

03:33.579 --> 03:35.889
This badge.

03:35.889 --> 03:39.979
Dunlop disc brakes.
They weren't just showing off.

03:39.979 --> 03:44.749
These were the same disc brakes
that brought them Le Mans victory.

03:44.749 --> 03:51.769
Jaguar worried that because they
stopped the Mark 2 so quickly, mere
mortals might pile into the back.

03:58.289 --> 04:04.649
That might sound twee. But in 1959,
this technology was mind-blowing.

04:04.649 --> 04:11.248
Good enough, in fact, to put
the Mark 2 in a league of its own.

04:13.489 --> 04:20.249
Today, Jaguar struggles with German
rivals BMW, Mercedes and Audi,

04:20.249 --> 04:23.582
but how was the competition
back then?

04:26.809 --> 04:29.199
This is the Mercedes.

04:29.199 --> 04:31.919
A 220 saloon.

04:31.919 --> 04:34.549
Mmm. Racy!

04:34.549 --> 04:37.199
This is the BMW 2000.

04:37.199 --> 04:41.949
It's getting there, but powerwise,
it's still in short trousers.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.599
And this is the Audi.

04:45.599 --> 04:50.319
They weren't trying. They hadn't
even bothered to exist in 1959.

04:50.319 --> 04:50.399
Not only did the Mark 2
drive better than everything else,

04:50.399 --> 04:54.904
it also looked better.

04:57.559 --> 05:00.379
Quite tricky to pull off.

05:00.379 --> 05:03.519
More so when you consider in 1959,

05:03.519 --> 05:10.479
Jaguar didn't have a styling
department - no style gurus to draw

05:10.479 --> 05:12.719
these glorious shapes.

05:12.719 --> 05:15.639
Sir William Lyons,
Jaguar's founder,

05:15.639 --> 05:18.559
in the day would run the company.

05:18.559 --> 05:23.439
On summer evenings, he'd work on
the prototypes here in his garden,

05:23.439 --> 05:29.079
using the light, looking to see how
it fell on these gorgeous curves.

05:29.079 --> 05:35.079
The head gardener of the time says
the local children would line up

05:35.079 --> 05:38.719
along that wall and watch him work.

05:38.719 --> 05:43.239
The 3. 8 could hit 60mph
in eight and a half seconds -

05:43.239 --> 05:47.239
that was faster
than all the Germans,

05:47.239 --> 05:52.689
faster than many purpose-built
sports cars of the day.

05:52.689 --> 05:57.239
Faster, even,
than some modern S-Type Jags.

05:57.239 --> 06:00.049
Best of all,

06:00.049 --> 06:03.359
it was accessible
because it was cheap.

06:03.359 --> 06:06.809
If you consider changing fashions,

06:06.809 --> 06:09.839
it wasn't the Jaguar of its time.

06:09.839 --> 06:12.849
It was the Subaru Impreza.

06:12.849 --> 06:15.799
An Aston Martin DB4

06:15.799 --> 06:20.089
came in at £3,200 with 300bhp.

06:20.089 --> 06:27.009
But you could have a Mark 2
Jaguar 3. 8 with 220bhp for £1,600.

06:27.009 --> 06:29.559
Some didn't pay that.

06:29.559 --> 06:35.929
The Mark 2 was the car of choice
for Britain's getaway drivers.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.659
Roy James, the getaway driver

06:38.659 --> 06:43.879
for the Great Train Robbers, was
particular about his Jag Mark 2s.

06:43.879 --> 06:48.929
He'd always steal a 3.4 rather than
a 3. 8 as he preferred the handling.

06:48.929 --> 06:54.469
Not a lot of people know that.
ENGINE ROARS

06:54.469 --> 07:01.079
The Mark 2 ran for most of the
'60s, but by 1968 it was all over.

07:01.079 --> 07:07.719
Not a bad thing. Jaguar had been
swallowed up by British Leyland.

07:07.719 --> 07:11.369
The BL monster
screwed up everything.

07:11.369 --> 07:17.009
So it had its eight-year run -
like most cars -

07:17.009 --> 07:19.949
but for me
it's the ultimate Jaguar.

07:19.949 --> 07:23.929
Not the first time
they used this design or engine,

07:23.929 --> 07:28.739
but as a package, the Mark 2 became
the definitive Jaguar saloon.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.669
It doesn't have the E-Type's

07:31.669 --> 07:36.429
knock-out glamour, but the way
we see Jaguars today as fast,

07:36.429 --> 07:40.616
affordable, classy sports saloons
was defined by this.

07:45.729 --> 07:48.749
I like the Mark 2, hugely.

07:48.749 --> 07:53.749
I didn't get into Jaguar till they
launched the Supercharge in 1990...

07:53.749 --> 07:56.149
Four. Four.

07:56.149 --> 08:00.789
Black XJRs are sinister -
Hannibal Lecter had one.

08:00.789 --> 08:04.749
He WAS sinister. I had one.
You're quite sinister.

08:04.749 --> 08:07.189
The great thing was,

08:07.189 --> 08:14.229
if you parked it outside a post
office, while you were away you
sensed it was robbing the place.

08:14.229 --> 08:17.289
Or eating the post mistress.

08:17.289 --> 08:20.429
JEREMY MAKES EATING NOISES

08:20.429 --> 08:24.029
The Lecter mobile is gone -
this is the new XJ.

08:24.029 --> 08:28.773
This is the Jaguar saloon for the
21st century.

08:31.828 --> 08:33.868
Right. We start tonight

08:33.868 --> 08:38.707
with some Vauxhall news -
of interest to these chaps

08:38.707 --> 08:44.748
cos you have an Astra diesel and
he's got a Vectra - not a new one.

08:44.748 --> 08:50.588
Dearie me. We've managed to get
a photo of next year's Astra.

08:50.588 --> 08:53.908
Who wants to see it? Nope. Yeah.

08:53.908 --> 08:58.508
You would like to see?
OK, fair enough.

08:58.508 --> 09:02.268
It IS nice. It's really nice.
Terrific.

09:02.268 --> 09:05.428
It'll never look
anything like that.

09:05.428 --> 09:11.178
I thought that so I rang Vauxhall.
I asked if it would look like that.

09:11.178 --> 09:16.948
They said yes. "If it doesn't, can
I eat your dog? " And he said yes.

09:16.948 --> 09:22.788
"The three-door Astra will look
like that. " Fabulous. Absolutely.

09:22.788 --> 09:25.868
Have a look at this, OK?

09:25.868 --> 09:29.828
A Ferrari. This stripe's
what we're interested in.

09:29.828 --> 09:36.068
Reading down this options list,
how much do you think this costs?

09:36.068 --> 09:39.078
If you want the stripe.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.908
£1,000. £1,500. For some paint?!

09:41.908 --> 09:45.188
Shall I tell you? £3,643.

09:45.188 --> 09:48.668
For a stripe. Bargain! Bargain!

09:48.668 --> 09:52.508
Says the man with the Astra diesel!
LAUGHTER

09:52.508 --> 09:58.928
They have a championship race
where these compete.

09:58.928 --> 10:02.788
This is the road-going version.
It costs £30,000 more.

10:02.788 --> 10:09.308
But it's lighter, lower, they firm
up the suspension, about 425bhp,

10:09.308 --> 10:17.308
0-62 in 4.1 seconds. It HAS got
paddle shift and before you bleat
about flappy gearboxes, it's good.

10:17.308 --> 10:20.228
Sorry! Have you driven it?

10:20.228 --> 10:22.668
Yes. What happened?

10:22.668 --> 10:26.108
I crashed it.
LAUGHTER

10:26.108 --> 10:31.308
What happened? I went round a
corner, then I went round lots!

10:31.308 --> 10:36.118
I span it several times.
This is why it's called the F360.

10:36.118 --> 10:40.648
You're driving and then you go,
"F... " and do a 360.

10:40.648 --> 10:43.518
You know, you could be right!

10:43.518 --> 10:46.048
I've got news.

10:46.048 --> 10:51.038
When Rover MG bought itself
from BMW for £10 a few years ago,

10:51.038 --> 10:56.318
they made some fairly bold claims
about what they'd do. They said

10:56.318 --> 10:59.728
they'd have a new 45 by 2003,

10:59.728 --> 11:05.938
have a V8 engine in the ZT, they
said there'd be an SV super car,

11:05.938 --> 11:08.568
they'd make a space shuttle.

11:08.568 --> 11:13.198
Space station. They were gonna
build a space shuttle to get there.

11:13.198 --> 11:18.678
A Rover space station would be fab,
dark metallic green, with a grill

11:18.678 --> 11:21.148
that would appear every 24 hours.

11:21.148 --> 11:27.158
A really nice clock somewhere, too.
We're just thinking of Rover.

11:27.158 --> 11:30.938
IN BRUMMIE ACCENT: T minus six...
Did someone say tea?!

11:30.938 --> 11:35.168
It's 3.30pm now,
we're knocking off, mate!

11:35.168 --> 11:38.378
We'll do the launch in the morning.

11:38.378 --> 11:41.818
Anyway. No Rover space station.

11:41.818 --> 11:46.998
No super car, no Rover 45s, they've
not annexed China or bought India.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.908
But what they have done -

11:49.908 --> 11:56.278
I have a photo - is launch some
hoops for the MG. Check it out.

11:56.278 --> 12:01.398
You can now buy those hoops which,
er, will cost you £280,

12:01.398 --> 12:03.798
including VAT.

12:03.798 --> 12:08.278
Or, attached to the car...
LAUGHTER

12:08.278 --> 12:10.898
.. £339.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.478
Reliability studies. Oh, God.

12:13.478 --> 12:20.478
We love these because they tell us
which cars break down and why.

12:20.478 --> 12:26.518
This one's reliabilityindex. com.
Internet. Maybe not the best start.

12:26.518 --> 12:29.358
This makes interesting reading.

12:29.358 --> 12:32.318
Here's their most reliable cars.

12:32.318 --> 12:36.238
Their top ten goes -
number one, Mazda.

12:36.238 --> 12:39.968
Fair point. Anyone got a Mazda?
Yep.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.958
Does it ever break down? No.

12:42.958 --> 12:49.438
They never do. MX5 goes for ever.
Then in second place, Ford. Mmm.

12:49.438 --> 12:55.438
Anyone got a Ford? Yes.
Ever break down? No. Yes.

12:55.438 --> 13:01.688
Some do, some don't. I think this
reliability index gets a bit weak.

13:01.688 --> 13:05.438
Third most reliable car - Fiat.

13:05.438 --> 13:09.598
LAUGHTER

13:09.598 --> 13:12.478
I mean, then it's got, you know,

13:12.478 --> 13:18.318
Honda, Volkswagen, Mercedes,
Toyota, Volvo. But third, Fiat!

13:18.318 --> 13:22.408
What have they got
as the most unreliable car?

13:22.408 --> 13:27.878
The second least reliable make -
LEAST reliable - is Subaru!

13:27.878 --> 13:30.088
LAUGHTER

13:30.088 --> 13:37.048
They're the most reliable cars
imaginable! I've never had a letter

13:37.048 --> 13:40.798
from a Subaru owner saying,
"My Subaru broke down. " So.

13:40.798 --> 13:46.898
No, no! What's the most unreliable?
Toyota? I bet it's Toyota. Jeep.

13:46.898 --> 13:50.768
Jeep - oh, Jeep was one? Yeah.

13:50.768 --> 13:55.538
Do you want that? Absolute rubbish!
LAUGHTER

13:55.538 --> 14:01.330
Interesting. A brochure about the
opening of a new car park in Leeds.

14:01.330 --> 14:08.250
"We're changing how people park and
also how they think about parking. "

14:08.250 --> 14:12.300
Think about parking?!
You're done!

14:12.300 --> 14:18.000
"Parking provides a vital link
in the mobility chain. " It does...

14:18.000 --> 14:24.090
"It is never an end in itself. "
You don't go and do some parking!

14:24.090 --> 14:29.050
Had a nice day?! I've been invited
to the opening of this car park.

14:29.050 --> 14:33.700
In Leeds? I have to say
I'm very disappointed in it.

14:33.700 --> 14:39.000
When I joined Top Gear, I thought,
"Here we go. Film festivals. " No.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.820
My invite's to the opening
of a car park. It says -

14:42.820 --> 14:49.510
"Yes, please. I'd like to come
to the car park opening. I'll be
arriving A - by car, B - on foot. "

14:51.850 --> 14:57.460
I rang them and said, "I'll come
by car. Will there be parking?"

14:57.460 --> 15:05.190
When I hosted Have I Got News For
You, seven people called the BBC
to say I was a very bad presenter.

15:05.190 --> 15:11.500
When my guest tonight hosted it,
85 people rang
and said he was excellent.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.720
He's the Conservative MP for
Henley, editor of The Spectator,

15:15.720 --> 15:20.800
and it seems he's 92 times better
than me at hosting news quizzes.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.166
Boris Johnson.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.860
How are you? Nice to see you.
Have a seat.

15:36.460 --> 15:41.220
This Have I Got News For You stuff.
It is tricky, isn't it? Very.

15:41.220 --> 15:47.830
Tricky for me, at least.
It was trying to remember what bit
to look at at any given time.

15:47.830 --> 15:52.360
Angus earned his money. They
should bring him back. Who agrees?

15:52.360 --> 15:54.440
AUDIENCE: YES!

15:54.440 --> 15:57.160
Not hanging, but bring back Angus.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.000
The thing I've got to find out

16:00.000 --> 16:03.540
is most politicians seem pretty
incompetent,

16:03.540 --> 16:09.870
but have a veneer of competence.
You seem to do it
the other way round. Yes.

16:09.870 --> 16:17.170
It is possible that beneath
the veneer of a blithering idiot
there lurks a blithering idiot.

16:17.170 --> 16:21.360
Are you a blithering idiot?
No, no, my dear fellow.

16:21.360 --> 16:27.860
You didn't drive a tractor through
a barn? It's perfectly true.
It was long ago.

16:27.860 --> 16:31.350
Have you ever driven a tractor
very fast?

16:31.350 --> 16:33.860
No. Nobody has.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.430
Well, this was a fast one,
by my standards.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.700
A Massey Ferguson with many gears.

16:40.700 --> 16:46.190
And at the crucial moment I couldn't
remember which to use to slow down.

16:46.190 --> 16:50.910
I sort of blanked, and I went out
through the back of the barn...

16:50.910 --> 16:55.580
Through the wall? Yup. Anyway,
it was all right in the end.

16:55.580 --> 16:59.590
They docked my pay
where I was working.

16:59.590 --> 17:04.170
It was easy to replace the wall.
What were you, a tractor driver?

17:04.170 --> 17:06.530
Part time, yes.

17:06.530 --> 17:09.460
And now, you write about cars?

17:09.460 --> 17:15.089
Yes, well, Jeremy, I sit at your
feet in terms of writing about cars.

17:15.089 --> 17:20.390
Like Aeschylus feasting from scraps
from the rich banquet of Homer.

17:20.390 --> 17:26.250
That's the sort of thing that goes
down big on Top Gear, isn't it?

17:26.250 --> 17:29.190
That's a good thing? It is good.

17:29.190 --> 17:35.810
I do enjoy your motoring column
in GQ magazine. It's very good.
I don't know anything about cars.

17:35.810 --> 17:40.470
I shouldn't say that, actually.
I know more than I used to.

17:40.470 --> 17:45.160
This is a little observation
that Boris made about the Maserati.

17:45.160 --> 17:49.990
"Look how much has been crammed in.
The great, big, fat, long things.

17:49.990 --> 17:55.030
"The vast doodah with the squiggly
bits coming out of the, er... "

17:55.030 --> 17:58.670
Jeremy, I... Do you really
know your stuff about cars?

17:58.670 --> 18:01.610
Absolutely no idea.

18:01.610 --> 18:04.610
I've no idea how an engine works.

18:04.610 --> 18:09.610
People have sat me down and said...
Do you know? No. Not the faintest.

18:09.610 --> 18:16.470
The pistons go up and down and
you go along. How does it happen?
He'll know. He's got a beard.

18:16.470 --> 18:21.530
It is a miracle. But I'm a very
keen cyclist. Unlike you, I think.

18:21.530 --> 18:27.110
I loathe bikes. And you talk on
a mobile while you're doing it. No.

18:27.110 --> 18:30.050
Well, I do. Yes.

18:30.050 --> 18:35.890
I wanted to make a point
about my willingness to reform,

18:35.890 --> 18:40.670
as it's true that I did once talk
on a mobile phone whilst cycling.

18:40.670 --> 18:43.970
And why shouldn't you be able to?

18:43.970 --> 18:48.070
Because you can't reach the brakes.
You can with one hand.

18:48.070 --> 18:53.630
I... Are you saying people with
one arm shouldn't be allowed bikes?

18:53.630 --> 19:01.390
LAUGHTER
Are you? Because I put it to you
that that's discriminatory.

19:01.390 --> 19:07.030
People with one arm shouldn't ride
bikes... What do you mean?

19:07.030 --> 19:11.590
No-one should be allowed to ride a
bike. They take up too much space.

19:11.590 --> 19:16.940
And they don't pay to be there.
I think bicycles are wonderful.

19:16.940 --> 19:21.550
You wouldn't park in a cycle lane,
would you? I do drive in them.

19:21.550 --> 19:25.440
You drive in them? And bus lanes.
They're a great idea.

19:25.440 --> 19:32.200
For you? Yeah, because you think,
"Everyone's not in it,
I'm late" and zoom up it.

19:32.200 --> 19:36.530
Are you allowed to say
that on telly? I just did.

19:36.530 --> 19:42.230
I defy the makers of Top Gear
to keep that in the final edit.

19:42.230 --> 19:47.750
I think that's a challenge.
Who drives in bus lanes? One. Two.

19:47.750 --> 19:52.140
Exactly. There's only three of us.
They're empty for our use.

19:52.140 --> 19:56.930
Do you like the road? Are you the
kind of guy whose car's towed away?

19:56.930 --> 20:01.740
It has been towed away now and then,
yeah. I wouldn't hide it from you.

20:01.740 --> 20:09.350
I have to say the last time it
happened it was in defiance of every
bylaw. My car was legally parked.

20:09.350 --> 20:16.830
And I had the testimony of TWO
traffic wardens that it was legally
parked in a residents' parking bay.

20:16.830 --> 20:24.190
Mmm-hmm. But the point I want
to make is that once your car
is one inch off the ground,

20:24.190 --> 20:30.340
once it's in that dreadful hammock,
it is no longer yours.
You have no rights over it.

20:30.340 --> 20:35.340
Nothing you can say to the tower...
I have a theory on that.

20:35.340 --> 20:41.140
I think if you leapt onto the
bonnet as it was dangling around...

20:41.140 --> 20:43.900
Got one wheel down on the Tarmac?

20:43.900 --> 20:48.960
There's no way in hell that...
They'll have to put it down again.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.200
I'm sure of that.

20:51.200 --> 20:57.140
You're here to find out how good
a driver you are. I have an idea.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.830
Really? I think I'm extremely bad.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.680
"Extremely bad"!

21:01.680 --> 21:06.481
Who'd like to see Boris's lap?
Yes! Here we go.

21:07.540 --> 21:12.860
Well, that was a start. It's made
clear to me why we're coached.

21:12.860 --> 21:17.220
I'm the worst driver
there's ever been!

21:17.220 --> 21:20.986
Aim for the apex. Aim for the apex!

21:23.140 --> 21:25.140
SOMETHING BEEPS

21:25.140 --> 21:28.160
Who hooted at me? Someone hooted.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.742
This is quite...

21:35.650 --> 21:37.900
There we are!

21:37.900 --> 21:40.926
Across the line!

21:43.920 --> 21:48.160
Don't feel bad about going
off-road. Was it uncomfortable?

21:48.160 --> 21:54.400
It was fine. Very good car.
It is. Very reasonably priced.
You can buy it for 25p.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.630
Really? That one!

21:56.630 --> 22:00.400
Where do you think
you're going to come?

22:00.400 --> 22:04.010
Up with Jay Kay, Jamie Oliver
and Gordon Ramsay?

22:04.010 --> 22:06.640
Or Jonathan Ross, Harry Enfield?

22:06.640 --> 22:10.350
I think towards the...
If not the very last.

22:10.350 --> 22:15.200
You couldn't be slower
than Harry Enfield. I've no idea.

22:15.200 --> 22:21.320
He's terrified
someone will be slower. He's only
13 seconds slower than Jay Kay.

22:21.320 --> 22:24.450
On that track, that's four years.

22:24.450 --> 22:29.140
Anyway, I have your time here.
You did it in one minute...

22:29.140 --> 22:31.790
56 seconds, everybody!

22:31.790 --> 22:34.760
He's faster...

22:34.760 --> 22:39.015
than Jonathan Ross!
Could be worse. Could be worse.

22:40.470 --> 22:42.100
Boris Johnson!

22:42.100 --> 22:45.877
APPLAUSE DROWNS OUT SPEECH

22:51.768 --> 22:54.858
The new Jaguar XJ.

22:54.858 --> 22:59.498
It looks... exactly the same
as the old Jaguar XJ.

22:59.498 --> 23:03.118
That can't have been difficult
to design -

23:03.118 --> 23:07.538
"What shall we do?
I like the old one, let's do that. "

23:07.538 --> 23:12.698
But in fact it's bigger, so you get
stuff you didn't get on the old XJ.

23:12.698 --> 23:17.698
Things like room in the back
for full-size people. Comfortable?

23:17.698 --> 23:22.498
I never noticed that
as a big problem for some reason.

23:22.498 --> 23:27.478
You also get, for the first time,
a proper-sized boot

23:27.478 --> 23:29.978
that you can get stuff in. Comfy?

23:29.978 --> 23:31.618
Very.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.448
Despite being so much bigger,

23:34.448 --> 23:38.778
it's a fifth of a ton lighter
than the previous XJ.

23:38.778 --> 23:42.418
That's because the new one
is made of aluminium.

23:42.418 --> 23:46.618
A lighter car is nimbler, faster,
more economical

23:46.618 --> 23:49.398
and kinder to the environment.

23:49.398 --> 23:53.598
The old XJ, the one
I couldn't fit in the boot of,

23:53.598 --> 23:58.318
that was made of lead and rock
and churches.

23:58.318 --> 24:03.228
It was like a big velvet glove -
pick you up after a hard day

24:03.228 --> 24:06.138
and gently deposit you at home.

24:06.138 --> 24:13.258
This one, what worries me
is that some of the Jaguariness
will have been lost.

24:13.258 --> 24:18.321
To find out,
I designed a cunning test.

24:23.188 --> 24:27.838
Because Jaguars are supposed
to ease the burden of travel,

24:27.838 --> 24:33.518
I thought I'd see how far I could
go before I got bored and tired.

24:33.518 --> 24:38.228
There are so many things that
usually annoy me on a motorway -

24:38.228 --> 24:43.138
Iike people in Mondeos,
registration number M134 LWR,

24:43.138 --> 24:46.868
who sit in the middle lane
for no reason.

24:46.868 --> 24:49.578
But there is fun stuff, too.

24:49.578 --> 24:51.608
This is Staffordshire now,

24:51.608 --> 24:55.138
voted recently
in a Country Life survey,

24:55.138 --> 24:58.788
as the worst county in England.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.618
But they won't have looked
at the important things -

25:02.618 --> 25:06.988
the quality of slip roads
going into service stations.

25:06.988 --> 25:11.788
On that front, Stafford Services
is in a class of its own.

25:11.788 --> 25:13.528
Here we go.

25:15.988 --> 25:18.988
You could brake hard, good brakes.

25:18.988 --> 25:23.088
Hug the apex all the way,
let it run wide.

25:23.088 --> 25:28.068
The air suspension working
overtime, keeps us flat and level.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.229
Into the hairpin.

25:31.898 --> 25:35.648
And...
Here we are, coming up to the pits.

25:35.648 --> 25:37.668
What a lap!

25:37.668 --> 25:41.108
I can't believe how light
the door is.

25:41.108 --> 25:46.348
You know the Little Tikes cars kids
have? Red ones with yellow rooves?

25:46.348 --> 25:49.875
That's what this feels like.
Watch this.

25:55.348 --> 26:00.695
It should pay dividends
where it matters - here.

26:02.068 --> 26:08.668
One of the worst things about
the old Jag was filling it up -
it went, "Zz-ggh zz-ggh. "

26:08.668 --> 26:11.348
This, though, is going in smoothly.

26:11.348 --> 26:13.976
That's a big improvement.

26:15.068 --> 26:18.708
Out of the services,
it was time for another jam.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.408
Guess what was at the other end.

26:21.408 --> 26:23.948
Cheshire.

26:23.948 --> 26:27.668
I'm not sure the Jag
will play well here.

26:27.668 --> 26:30.548
Its bonnet is not onyx enough.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.428
If you're interested in aesthetics,

26:33.428 --> 26:38.348
you need either a Sport or the XJR,
like I've got here.

26:38.348 --> 26:44.071
If you buy the SE, you get the
worst radiator grille in the world.

26:45.148 --> 26:48.588
And the wheels are too narrow
on SEs.

26:48.588 --> 26:52.228
So they look pinched,
like Joyce Grenfell.

26:52.228 --> 26:57.609
Except not just pinched, they've
also got that silly grille, so...

26:58.668 --> 27:00.693
Like that.

27:04.278 --> 27:07.068
I'll tell you what is nice -

27:07.068 --> 27:14.948
they must have been tempted to go
with the Kevlar interior, but
they stuck with wood and leather.

27:14.948 --> 27:17.618
You still feel hemmed in -

27:17.618 --> 27:21.848
big, tall, centre console and...
It's just nice.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.726
It's like you're in an eiderdown.

27:25.758 --> 27:30.818
Now, time for the traditional
motorway traveller's smorgasbord.

27:30.818 --> 27:32.558
Double Decker.

27:34.448 --> 27:38.098
That's the trouble
with eating Double Deckers -

27:38.098 --> 27:40.965
bits of it fall off into your lap.

27:42.008 --> 27:43.648
Try a Twirl.

27:43.648 --> 27:46.338
Boost Guarana.

27:46.338 --> 27:47.878
Oh, got a...

27:47.878 --> 27:50.928
New Chunky Kit Kat!

27:50.928 --> 27:53.218
Twix, an old favourite.

27:53.218 --> 27:56.668
Mmm. That's very good.

27:56.668 --> 28:01.241
That was a delicious lunch.
Looking forward to my tea.

28:04.628 --> 28:09.118
William Hague once said to me
I was the type of person

28:09.118 --> 28:13.441
who thought the Lake District
got in the way of the M6.

28:14.478 --> 28:20.318
It does. We have to go round these
corners for these silly lumps.

28:20.318 --> 28:22.240
It is pretty, though.

28:23.958 --> 28:28.478
I hate car journeys.
They're so mind-crashingly boring.

28:28.478 --> 28:32.148
But after six hours and 330 miles
in a Jag,

28:32.148 --> 28:36.918
I was still relaxed.
No matter what the irritation.

28:36.918 --> 28:40.398
MUSIC: "Smack My Bitch Up"
by Prodigy

28:40.398 --> 28:43.158
This is Radio One.

28:43.158 --> 28:48.678
Normally, that's like having
a screwdriver shoved inside you.

28:48.678 --> 28:51.078
But today, it's fine.

28:51.078 --> 28:54.678
This chap
wants to "bitchslap his 'ho".

28:54.678 --> 28:58.023
Why not? Good luck to you, fella.

29:03.278 --> 29:08.738
Let's try Radio Four. 'Society
hasn't always valued originality.

29:08.738 --> 29:12.838
'Should we...? ' It's Melvin Bragg's
philosophy show.

29:12.838 --> 29:16.838
'To what extent
is originality about perception?

29:16.838 --> 29:22.108
'Is originality a concept without
meaning today? ' I'm not with you.

29:22.108 --> 29:25.145
I don't understand the question.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

29:34.598 --> 29:38.378
So, this is Glasgow
and I'm still feeling fresh.

29:38.378 --> 29:41.118
I shall plough on.

29:41.118 --> 29:46.420
Glad I did, because in Scotland
the Jag got even better.

29:47.758 --> 29:54.238
On the motorway,
it felt like a comfortable cruiser,
like a 7 Series BMW,

29:54.238 --> 30:00.658
now the motorway's finished
and it's twisty and curvy,
it seems to have shrunk.

30:00.658 --> 30:06.018
I would swear I was driving
a car the size of a 3 Series BMW.

30:06.018 --> 30:11.668
This is what we want - it soothes
away the monotony of the motorway

30:11.668 --> 30:15.598
and then sticks its hand
down your trousers

30:15.598 --> 30:18.328
when the road gets curly.

30:18.328 --> 30:20.740
Which it has done!

30:25.848 --> 30:29.598
The old XJR
drank fuel like a space shuttle.

30:29.598 --> 30:33.928
This one got from Stafford
to the Highlands on one tank.

30:33.928 --> 30:35.520
Just.

30:36.598 --> 30:40.248
I'm now playing
what I call Fuel Light Bingo

30:40.248 --> 30:42.678
The rules are simple -

30:42.678 --> 30:48.388
Iet the fuel light come on, then
let the needle go through the red

30:48.388 --> 30:51.878
till it's at the bottom
of the gauge.

30:51.878 --> 30:56.358
When you see a sign saying,
"Services 1 mile and 27 miles",

30:56.358 --> 31:01.368
go for the furthest one away and
when you get there, go past that.

31:01.368 --> 31:07.348
If you make it home, the next day
your wife fills up the car for you.

31:07.348 --> 31:10.108
I think it's a great game.

31:10.108 --> 31:12.878
My wife doesn't like it very much.

31:12.878 --> 31:15.711
If you lose, you run out of petrol.

31:18.248 --> 31:25.478
When I finally coughed into a shop
that sold petrol from one
of Robert Louis Stevenson's pumps,

31:25.478 --> 31:29.508
it turned out the Jag
had done 22.7 mpg.

31:29.508 --> 31:33.148
Not bad
for a supercharged 4.2 litre V8.

31:52.459 --> 31:54.779
Oh, dear.

31:54.779 --> 31:57.639
I seem to have run out of country.

31:57.639 --> 32:01.985
This time of night,
should be quite a nice trip back.

32:05.139 --> 32:07.839
So what's the verdict, Jeremy?

32:07.839 --> 32:11.939
Well, I still like the Fuse
best of all.

32:11.939 --> 32:17.379
The Boost was like a Double Decker,
you arrive with melted brown.

32:17.379 --> 32:21.539
Jeremy, the car.
Oh, the verdict on the car?

32:21.539 --> 32:26.979
It's very good and at £58,000 for
the XJR, it's good value for money.

32:26.979 --> 32:31.259
That's a lot cheaper
than the BMW, Merc or Audi.

32:31.259 --> 32:33.899
What's your favourite in the range?

32:33.899 --> 32:37.849
Er...
The 4.2 SE, it's the most Jaguar-y.

32:37.849 --> 32:43.509
Yours? At the entry level,
the three-litre V6 is about 39?

32:43.509 --> 32:46.439
That's a perfectly acceptable car.

32:46.439 --> 32:50.139
In the XJR,
I wafted up to John O'Groats.

32:50.139 --> 32:53.219
No backache, wasn't tired.

32:53.219 --> 32:57.849
The only thing I didn't like
was the air suspension.

32:57.849 --> 33:02.199
The old XJ used to glide around
at low speeds.

33:02.199 --> 33:07.059
The air suspension can't absorb
bumps at slow speeds.

33:07.059 --> 33:14.219
We hope air suspension
goes away very soon. And
takes those flappy gearboxes. Yes.

33:14.219 --> 33:17.599
Right, the Cool Wall,
where's it going to go?

33:17.599 --> 33:22.939
Black XJR. Where's it going?
I think we've kind of proven. Cool?

33:22.939 --> 33:27.689
I think it's bordering on super...
On sub zero.

33:27.689 --> 33:31.879
Black XJR... It's there.
Mmm... There.

33:31.879 --> 33:37.559
It's also getting higher! I won't
even go there. I can't be bothered.

33:37.559 --> 33:43.109
The rest of the range has
a problem. It looks just like that!

33:43.109 --> 33:48.829
Isn't that uncanny? Incredible!
AUDIENCE LAUGH

33:48.829 --> 33:54.469
Isn't that a dreadful grille?
Just say, "Yes, Jeremy. "

33:54.469 --> 34:00.629
AUDIENCE: Yes, Jeremy.
I've found a dealer who, for £250,

34:00.629 --> 34:05.559
will put the XJR grille on any XJ.
Really? That admits it's wrong,

34:05.559 --> 34:11.109
but if it's got that standard
grille, the Jeremy's face grille,

34:11.109 --> 34:13.949
that's uncool. Sorry! It spoils it.

34:13.949 --> 34:18.228
Now, would you buy the Jag
over anything else?

34:18.228 --> 34:24.228
I'm a Jag man, yes. So would I.
I wouldn't buy the 7 Series BM,

34:24.228 --> 34:28.549
as it's too ugly.
The Audi A8 isn't quite there yet.

34:28.549 --> 34:35.509
S-Class Mercedes...
Merchant banker. Merchant banker,
yeah! It's a merchant banker's car,

34:35.509 --> 34:40.268
so yeah, I'd have the Jag.
But there is one slight problem.

34:40.268 --> 34:46.268
In a few weeks we'll be testing
this, the new Volkswagen Phaeton.

34:46.268 --> 34:52.549
I suspect that this will put a big
German fly in Jaguar's ointment.

34:52.549 --> 34:57.909
Now, Hammond, do you have £58,500
to spend on a new XJR? I don't.

34:57.909 --> 35:04.269
I don't. But with insider dealing,
we've got more sense than money.

35:04.269 --> 35:09.029
This is the 1994 XJR, with six
cylinders, but still a nice car.

35:09.029 --> 35:12.029
More raw than the others as well.

35:12.029 --> 35:17.189
It's like this, but with different
wheels. I found one in black

35:17.189 --> 35:21.669
at less than £8,000.
That's a tempting buy.

35:21.669 --> 35:25.589
But...? I have got
a slight reservation.

35:25.589 --> 35:29.629
Buy one by all means,
you'll be very happy.

35:29.629 --> 35:33.309
I've nearly done it
a couple of times.

35:33.309 --> 35:36.969
But it will lose money,
and never stop.

35:36.969 --> 35:43.389
If it's £8,000 now,
that'll be halved next year.
I'm not saying don't buy one.

35:43.389 --> 35:48.770
But buy one knowing that you'll
keep it, because it'll lose value.

35:51.009 --> 35:57.319
Here's the ultimate underground
car. It's called the Jaguar XKRR.

35:57.319 --> 36:02.389
It's lowered, it has racing seats,
there's a place to put your helmet,

36:02.389 --> 36:08.589
it's got enormous wheels
and exhausts by Matrix Churchill,
it's a concept.

36:08.589 --> 36:13.231
But, unlike the R Coupe we saw at
the start, this one actually works.

36:19.189 --> 36:23.589
Unlike any previous XK,
this one has a manual gearbox.

36:23.589 --> 36:27.650
You can do 58 miles an hour...
in first!

36:29.069 --> 36:35.269
They've also changed the rear
suspension, an XK Achilles heel.

36:35.269 --> 36:40.629
In fact, they've changed the whole
rear and added a limited-slip diff.

36:40.629 --> 36:44.656
Which means...you can do this.

36:48.269 --> 36:51.170
'If you try this in a normal XK...

36:52.469 --> 36:58.369
'..you'd spin. But this just grips
and goes. It's a cat...

36:58.369 --> 37:01.089
'gone feral!'

37:01.089 --> 37:05.829
I love this car. But sadly,
they can't put it into production,

37:05.829 --> 37:09.869
because Jaguar
has a sister company, Aston Martin.

37:09.869 --> 37:16.149
This would jump up and down all
over Aston's new car, the DB7 GT.

37:18.869 --> 37:22.549
This shape has been with us
for ten years,

37:22.549 --> 37:27.829
but neither time nor Aston's
misguided attempts to improve it

37:27.829 --> 37:30.832
have managed to ruin it.

37:34.309 --> 37:39.009
For the GT, they've gone mad.
There's a new boot lid,

37:39.009 --> 37:44.349
there are lumps on the bonnet,
and there's a new radiator grille.

37:44.349 --> 37:49.439
All these things are terrible,
but when Sean Connery grew a beard,

37:49.439 --> 37:51.999
my wife still fancied him.

37:53.029 --> 37:55.229
FAINT BEEPING

37:55.229 --> 37:59.269
Inside, you still get
a handmade feel.

37:59.269 --> 38:03.319
When I shut the centre console lid,
the ashtray opens.

38:03.319 --> 38:08.229
This window won't shut properly,
so once you go over 50mph,

38:08.229 --> 38:11.219
you get a bit of wind noise.

38:11.219 --> 38:15.969
But that's not the most annoying
sound that the Aston makes.

38:15.969 --> 38:19.639
You stop this "bong"
by closing the door,

38:19.639 --> 38:24.379
but when you start the ignition,
you get a new "bong".

38:24.379 --> 38:28.918
It must be to remind Americans
they're in a car.

38:33.599 --> 38:38.639
Actually, you couldn't sell this
to an American. He wouldn't fit.

38:38.639 --> 38:42.989
There's nowhere for my left leg,
or for my head.

38:42.989 --> 38:47.779
Remember that beneath everything,
this is basically a Jaguar XJS.

38:47.779 --> 38:52.879
It's a 30-year-old design. How much
are they charging for all this?

38:52.879 --> 38:56.383
£104,000!

38:59.599 --> 39:04.349
'It's time to tuck the DB7 up
in bed with a nice mug of cocoa,

39:04.349 --> 39:09.059
'and let Jaguar make
that brilliant XKRR instead.

39:13.359 --> 39:16.879
'Except for one tiny detail. '

39:16.879 --> 39:22.759
This GT version is not
just a cynical marketing exercise.

39:22.759 --> 39:26.799
It's not just a beard
to cover the wrinkles.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.802
What it is, is amazing.

39:47.879 --> 39:52.805
It may be cramped, old
and expensive, but it is epic fun.

39:56.539 --> 40:00.199
The old DB7 was never much cop
to drive,

40:00.199 --> 40:04.919
but they've been through it with
a fine-tooth comb and changed it.

40:04.919 --> 40:10.799
They've stiffened up the bushes
at the front and I cannot tell you,

40:10.799 --> 40:15.109
I cannot stress enough
how much it's improved.

40:15.109 --> 40:17.600
ENGINE REVS

40:18.618 --> 40:21.959
It's not just better
than the old DB7.

40:21.959 --> 40:27.658
I know of no other car which offers
such an intoxicating blend

40:27.658 --> 40:32.118
of grip, handling,
and surprisingly, ride comfort.

40:32.119 --> 40:36.129
There's something else as well.
Power!

40:36.129 --> 40:40.119
♪ Round round, baby, round round,
spend the night on me

40:40.119 --> 40:45.359
♪ I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free... ♪

40:45.359 --> 40:47.759
God, it's fast!

40:49.159 --> 40:52.189
'Sounds good too. Listen to this. '

40:52.189 --> 40:55.249
ENGINE GROWLS HEARTILY

41:00.178 --> 41:04.829
HE CHUCKLES
'The six-litre V12 is more powerful

41:04.829 --> 41:09.898
'than a normal DB7 and then,
there's its party piece. '

41:09.898 --> 41:12.537
Let me show you something.

41:13.609 --> 41:18.369
I'm gonna stop, put it
into fourth gear, and off we go.

41:18.369 --> 41:20.909
It sets off fine in fourth.

41:20.909 --> 41:24.989
Foot down, and we're going
at 40 miles an hour.

41:24.989 --> 41:28.229
50 miles an hour. 60 miles an hour.

41:28.229 --> 41:31.709
70, 80, really into its stride now,

41:31.709 --> 41:36.538
90, 100, really gathering pace.
Still in fourth. I've not changed.

41:36.538 --> 41:42.349
120, 130 miles an hour,
135, we're on the rev limiter,

41:42.349 --> 41:46.991
that's 0-135... in one gear!

41:48.269 --> 41:50.938
HE CHUCKLES

41:50.938 --> 41:55.709
'For the last few years
the DB7's been an ageing rocker,

41:55.709 --> 41:59.829
'trying to cut it
in a Coldplay MP3 world

41:59.829 --> 42:04.619
'of Porsche 911s
and Foo Fighter Ferraris.

42:05.698 --> 42:10.149
'But now, thanks to a cocktail
of botox and Viagra,

42:10.149 --> 42:14.552
'it's up there
with the best of them. '

42:16.709 --> 42:19.218
What a car! I know.

42:19.218 --> 42:23.949
But I don't like these bumps
and louvres they've put on it.

42:23.949 --> 42:27.509
So I had a wheeze,
like Boris Johnson.

42:27.509 --> 42:32.989
What you should do is buy a used
DB7 V12, take it to Aston Martin,

42:32.989 --> 42:40.089
and they can put the GT suspension
stuff on it, and do the engine
as well if you want.

42:40.089 --> 42:42.609
Brilliant! How much does that cost?

42:42.609 --> 42:45.349
Well, a used DB7 is about £60,000,

42:45.349 --> 42:51.589
and then £10k for the suspension,
and another £10k for the engine.

42:51.589 --> 42:54.229
Is that your used-car tip?!

42:54.229 --> 42:59.989
You've taken an expensive car and
turned it into...an expensive car!

42:59.989 --> 43:05.429
It's 80 grand! It's all part
of the service, as is our lap,

43:05.429 --> 43:10.189
so it's time to pump up the Stig,
and see how fast it goes round.

43:10.189 --> 43:14.189
Away he goes.
Lots of wheel-spin there.

43:14.189 --> 43:17.590
The six-litre V12 is working hard.

43:22.529 --> 43:25.569
Stig is in a mellow mood today.

43:25.569 --> 43:28.072
Now, down to Chicago...

43:29.209 --> 43:31.245
Tidy.

43:33.669 --> 43:40.209
Last week, the Alpina Z8
was rubbish on the road
but blistering on our track.

43:40.209 --> 43:44.978
The Aston is vice versa. That soft
suspension is good on the road.

43:44.978 --> 43:50.898
That's mad driving from the Stig!
I'm not sure it'll be fast here.

43:50.898 --> 43:55.329
That is very fast
through the follow-through.

43:55.329 --> 44:00.098
Down to the penultimate bend,
sliding all over the place!

44:00.098 --> 44:03.529
Ooh, Stig, come on, have to gamble!

44:03.529 --> 44:06.058
Lurching in several directions,

44:06.058 --> 44:11.778
and across the line
in one minute and 30.4 seconds.

44:11.778 --> 44:16.549
That's very quick, and Aston Martin
reckoned it would've gone quicker,

44:16.549 --> 44:19.258
but it had a full tank of fuel.

44:19.258 --> 44:24.029
But that's faster than an Audi S4.
And behind the Alpina.

44:24.029 --> 44:28.778
But as road cars go, that's one
of the best I've driven in years.

44:28.778 --> 44:33.938
Now, who'd like
to see the XKRR do a lap?

44:33.938 --> 44:38.249
AUDIENCE: Yeah! So would we.
But since I drove it,

44:38.249 --> 44:43.039
it's gone back, and Jaguar are
fiddling with the rear suspension.

44:43.039 --> 44:47.778
So when we asked if we could have
it for the Stig, they said "Yes,

44:47.778 --> 44:51.289
"but it's currently
like a greasy weasel. "

44:51.289 --> 44:56.119
They said the Stig wouldn't want
to drive it in that state.

44:56.119 --> 45:00.839
And they're right, he probably
wouldn't, if we'd have told him!

45:00.839 --> 45:05.439
Here he comes now,
round the first corner.

45:05.439 --> 45:10.378
Getting himself warmed... oh,
look at him already! Ha ha ha!

45:10.378 --> 45:13.289
Come on, Stig, try to stay with it!

45:13.289 --> 45:16.326
JEREMY AND AUDIENCE LAUGH

45:17.338 --> 45:21.098
And that's a full 360
from the Stig!

45:21.098 --> 45:24.858
Across the line... backwards!
APPLAUSE

45:24.858 --> 45:28.138
Good old Stig.

45:28.138 --> 45:33.338
On that multidirectional bombshell,
I'm afraid we've got to go.

45:33.338 --> 45:37.001
But we'll see you next week.
Good night. Bye!
