I knew the very first
moment I saw her,

00:04.221 --> 00:07.766
she was pure helium.

00:07.790 --> 00:12.466
Here, hot on the resting
place of the restless dead.

00:12.490 --> 00:17.689
The crossroads of
demise as well as sex.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.692
Where death begets life,

00:20.716 --> 00:24.696
and life begets death.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.702
May I throw your
case, Mademoiselle?

00:30.726 --> 00:32.162
Merci.

I'd rather not.

Okay.

Hello?

Hello?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.419
Is anybody home?

07:25.619 --> 07:27.161
- Good afternoon.
- Oh!

07:27.185 --> 07:28.989
You scared the sh...

07:29.013 --> 07:32.602
Sorry, uh...

07:32.626 --> 07:34.560
I didn't see you there.

07:34.584 --> 07:37.607
Miss Bellerose, I presume?

07:37.631 --> 07:39.981
Allow me to introduce myself.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.656
I am the Vicar of Borley.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.726
Vicar, please.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.618
Please...

07:48.642 --> 07:49.817
be seated.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.841
Sorry.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.408
I'm just a little nervous.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.583
Uh, tired.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.367
I think I'm jetlagged.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.891
Sorry.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.849
I'm listening now. Um, I'm Lucy.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.547
Miss Bellerose,

08:04.571 --> 08:07.201
you will notice that
we conduct ourselves

08:07.225 --> 08:09.290
with a little bit
more civility here,

08:09.314 --> 08:12.642
perhaps a modicum of decorum
you're not yet used to.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.644
Yes, sir.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.298
I would like to first express
my deepest condolences

08:17.322 --> 08:18.996
for the passing of
your great-uncle,

08:19.020 --> 08:21.825
The Count Rose du Sang.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.828
I can assure you he was
an exemplary pillar

08:24.852 --> 08:26.090
of the community.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.439
Thank you.

08:27.463 --> 08:29.006
I didn't really know the guy.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.877
Regardless, it's
quite fortuitous

08:30.901 --> 08:33.706
that you arrived in time for
the interment tomorrow.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.274
I trust you'll get some rest

08:36.298 --> 08:38.972
and come amply rejuvenated
come morning.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.583
Yeah, that would
be proper, right?

08:41.607 --> 08:43.673
What am I saying? He's my uncle.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.588
Yes, of course, I...

08:45.612 --> 08:47.677
I will be ready
bright and early.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.679
Before you retire
for the evening,

08:49.703 --> 08:51.594
I'm afraid there's a few rules

08:51.618 --> 08:53.683
that we quite
stringently enforce

08:53.707 --> 08:54.945
here at Castle Borley.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.512
Yes, of course.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.689
The upper floors are
strictly off-limits.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.169
They're currently
under renovation

09:02.193 --> 09:04.476
and can prove to be
quite dangerous.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.738
Yeah, I wouldn't
want to get hurt

09:05.762 --> 09:07.566
or fall down a rabbit hole.

09:07.590 --> 09:11.614
Next, please be aware
that there are others

09:11.638 --> 09:13.920
residing here,

09:13.944 --> 09:17.184
and it would behoove you
not to disturb them.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.316
It definitely seems big enough.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.057
I can keep my own space.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.712
Do not feel compelled to
return each utterance

09:22.736 --> 09:24.714
with a banal affirmation.

09:24.738 --> 09:28.456
Now best if you remain here
on the bottom floors only.

09:28.480 --> 09:34.550
And, Lucy, any uninvited guests
are severely frowned upon.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.377
Understood.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.728
The chambermaid has
provided sustenance for you

09:38.752 --> 09:40.294
in the pantry,

09:40.318 --> 09:42.732
fresh bed linens in
your bed chamber.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.735
Your room is the
furthest due westward

09:45.759 --> 09:47.737
on the tertiary floor.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.739
I bid you adieu.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.155
Thank you.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.703
Oh, and, Miss Bellerose?

09:57.727 --> 10:02.447
As Vicar of the consecrated
grounds here at Castle Borley,

10:02.471 --> 10:05.755
my ancestors and I have
dedicated our lives

10:05.779 --> 10:10.107
to preserving and upholding
the reputation of your family

10:10.131 --> 10:11.761
for generations.

10:11.785 --> 10:17.767
So, please, do not make
me regret that now,

10:17.791 --> 10:19.464
starting with you alone.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.230
I'll do my best not
to disappoint you.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.825
Oh, shit, I almost forgot.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.457
Hi, virtual friends.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.198
It's me, and guess what?

10:58.222 --> 11:00.984
Surprise! I'm in Paris!

11:01.008 --> 11:03.726
Well, close enough.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.814
Bad news? My uncle died.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.729
I know, I know.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.556
But it's okay. He was a
really distant relative.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.298
Good news I'm in Paris!

11:11.322 --> 11:14.519
Mom's not here yet,
but when is she ever?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.608
Seriously, Mom, if you see this,

11:16.632 --> 11:18.741
will you please let me know
when you're gonna get here?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.656
Wait till you guys
see this place.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.354
It's straight out
of a fairy tale.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.685
I'll try to post more soon.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.925
Au revoir, Lucites.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.212
Oh.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.757
Note to self,

11:34.781 --> 11:37.348

Holy crap. What is
it with you people?

13:14.141 --> 13:15.248
I'm sorry, ma'am.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.381

No. No, it's... it's fine.

Mm.

13:48.915 --> 13:52.744
Must... take a shower.

Oh, shit.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.377
What the hell?

15:45.335 --> 15:47.618
If you'd be so
kind as to join us

15:47.642 --> 15:50.210
for the funeral rites.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.550
I'll be down soon.

16:06.574 --> 16:10.336
I just need some privacy
to shower and get dressed.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.123
Please, make haste.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.617
You guide me along
the right path

16:30.641 --> 16:33.838
for the sake of your name.

16:33.862 --> 16:37.450
Even when I walk
through a dark valley,

16:37.474 --> 16:40.149
I fear no harm,

16:40.173 --> 16:43.761
for you are at my side.

16:43.785 --> 16:48.157
Your rod and staff
give me courage.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.550
You set a table before me

16:50.574 --> 16:53.969
as I watch my enemies.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.180
Excusez-moi, Mademoiselle?

17:11.204 --> 17:12.355
Do you have some light?

17:12.378 --> 17:13.704
Sorry, I don't smoke.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.575
Of course you don't.

17:15.598 --> 17:18.230
With a face like that,
though, I don't blame you.

17:18.253 --> 17:19.405
You're not from
around here, are you?

17:19.429 --> 17:21.190
Is it that obvious?

17:21.214 --> 17:22.626
Uh, my name is Jean-Pierre.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.801
You can call me J.P.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.673
Bit more American style, no?

17:26.696 --> 17:28.762
And they say the
French are rude.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.329
Well, J.P., the devilishly
handsome gravedigger

17:30.353 --> 17:31.504
at your service.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.245
That's an actual job?

17:33.269 --> 17:35.291
Round here, quite a
lucrative one, yeah.

17:35.315 --> 17:38.207
Wait, you knew I was American?

17:38.231 --> 17:40.122
So it is that obvious.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.341
Well, without the handgun
and the Freedom Fries,

17:42.365 --> 17:44.063
it was extremely hard to tell.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.435
I'm Lucy.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.437
Lucy? Well, that's a name
you don't hear that often.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.222
Well, my mom wanted
to call me Desi,

17:53.246 --> 17:54.527
but I'm not a boy, so...

17:54.551 --> 17:56.007
You certainly are not that.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.487
Uh, Lucy Bellerose.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.925
Bellerose. Rose like the Count?

18:00.949 --> 18:03.232
- Are you...?
- Yeah, he's my uncle.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.712
Sorry, he was my great-uncle.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.236
Oh, I'm so sorry,
Madame, I didn't know.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.846
No, please, it's okay.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.891
He was always just
some blood relative

18:10.915 --> 18:13.198
living an ocean
away in a castle.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.765
To be honest, growing up,

18:14.789 --> 18:16.680
I used to call him
Count Dracula.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.509
Well, he was the
Blood Rose Count.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.988
No, no, no... Dracula,

18:21.012 --> 18:24.209
like, uh... um, Frankenstein

18:24.233 --> 18:26.342
or Wolfman.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.039
Never mind.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.519
Oh, but you know
the story, right?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.608
Of how the Count
got his namesake?

18:31.632 --> 18:34.219
No, actually.

18:34.243 --> 18:37.135
It is said that a king of France

18:37.159 --> 18:39.006
when he was still
a young prince,

18:39.030 --> 18:41.531
fell in love with a rose
farmer's beautiful daughter,

18:41.555 --> 18:44.186
his only child.

18:44.210 --> 18:47.014
When the prince's grandmother,
the queen, found out,

18:47.038 --> 18:49.104
rather than have her
lineage spoiled

18:49.128 --> 18:50.931
with that of peasantry,

18:50.955 --> 18:53.325
she ordered the girl to
be immediately killed.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.066
In her grief,

18:55.090 --> 18:57.242
the farmer's wife
also killed herself,

18:57.266 --> 18:59.636
leaving the farmer
completely alone.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.420
They were buried together

19:01.444 --> 19:03.596
amongst the roses of the
French countryside.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.511
Oh, my God.

19:05.535 --> 19:08.123
Wait, it gets better.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.735
It is said that around
their graves alone,

19:11.759 --> 19:13.780
the roses turn a dark blood red,

19:13.804 --> 19:17.001
instead of their
usual pastel colors.

19:17.025 --> 19:20.526
When the grieving prince became
old enough to be the king,

19:20.550 --> 19:23.268
he awarded the farmer
part of his kingdom

19:23.292 --> 19:25.531
and the title of
Count Rose du Sang,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.446
Count of the Blood Red Rose,

19:27.470 --> 19:29.429
your very forefather.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.931
Although grateful, the
farmer never did get over it

19:33.955 --> 19:37.326
and vowed to avenge his
wife and daughter's death,

19:37.350 --> 19:39.352
cursing your family forever.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.245
Are you serious?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.400
That's horrible.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.514
Oh, my God, you are
so full of shit.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.777
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.082
Uh, but... but, wait.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.736
But my name is Bellerose.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.260
I actually always
wondered about that.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.000
Bellerose, a beautiful rose,

20:00.024 --> 20:02.177
just like you. What's to wonder?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.875
Look, uh, let me make
my cruel joke up to you

20:04.899 --> 20:06.703
and bring you to some
local wine tasting.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.967
I could use a friend.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.883
Wait, but what's the legal
drinking age around here?

20:12.907 --> 20:14.363
You do realize this is France,

20:14.387 --> 20:15.929
yes, my silly little rose?

20:15.953 --> 20:19.498
But of course!

20:19.522 --> 20:21.370
Um, you, uh...

20:21.394 --> 20:25.528
You know where to find
me, so au revoir.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.127
Hello?

21:56.576 --> 21:58.273
Don't be afraid.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.360
Uh, excuse, please.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.187
Is the man of the house around?

23:07.211 --> 23:08.493
Excuse me?

23:08.517 --> 23:10.103
Abel Baddon of Dauphine.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.062
Insurance salesman.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.456
Would love to have a chat
with the man of the house.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.546
I hope it's not life insurance,
'cause you just missed it.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.243
Out on an errand, is he?

23:19.267 --> 23:20.549
He's dead.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.812
Oh... my.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.380
Might I come inside
for a moment?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.425
I'm quite weary.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.849
I seem to have gotten myself
turned around at the crossroads.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.561
Sure.

23:32.585 --> 23:33.779
I'm Lucy.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.283
Enchanted.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.144
It's a beautiful home.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.712
Thanks. Kind of just figuring
it out still, but...

23:53.736 --> 23:56.106
Hi. Um, this is...

23:56.130 --> 23:59.022
Uh, wait, I actually
never got your name.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.197
Mary.

24:00.221 --> 24:03.418
Mary. Mary, this is...

24:03.442 --> 24:04.941
Abel. Abel Baddon.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.899
It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.466
Sorry, I'm terrible with names.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.989
I've made some food, Lucy.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.165
I'm sure that Mr.
Baddon can join us,

24:12.189 --> 24:15.952
but you know how the Vicar
feels about uninvited guests.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.910
I'm so sorry to hear
of his passing.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.608
Oh, not him, unfortunately.

24:19.632 --> 24:20.609
My uncle.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.480
Oh, of course.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.549
My apologies.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.814
Lucy, might I ask
you a question?

24:51.838 --> 24:53.816
It's a sales pitch of sorts.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.862
Sure, but I'm saving my money
for the Champs-Elysées.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.821
Fair enough.

24:58.845 --> 25:02.215
You see, I fancy myself
somewhat of a philosopher,

25:02.239 --> 25:04.653
and in my line of work...

25:04.677 --> 25:05.808
Well...

25:08.202 --> 25:11.486
what do you think of
your uncle's passing?

25:11.510 --> 25:13.052
Not sure I follow.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.228
Do you believe in an afterlife?

25:15.252 --> 25:20.233
In good deeds, a soul,
that sort of thing?

25:20.257 --> 25:22.888
I guess I never really
thought about it.

25:22.912 --> 25:26.022
But to answer your question,
who has time for an afterlife

25:26.046 --> 25:27.458
when we're so busy
living this one?

25:27.482 --> 25:29.329
Precisely.

25:29.353 --> 25:32.855
Precisely. Everything else
is just distractions.

25:32.879 --> 25:36.360
The only thing that really
matters is the here and now.

25:37.884 --> 25:38.904
Right?

25:38.928 --> 25:41.690
Sure, I guess.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.107
I mean, really, think about it.

25:46.196 --> 25:49.262
If once you die, you're gone,

25:49.286 --> 25:51.680
then the only thing
of real consequence

25:53.726 --> 25:56.052
is what you do right now.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.489
There is no right

25:58.513 --> 25:59.708
or wrong.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.884
Only one life

26:01.908 --> 26:03.823
to do as you please.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.586
So we should want to
live as long as possible

26:08.610 --> 26:10.545
on our own terms.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.938
Please, no need to fill her
head with such rubbish.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.311
I beg your pardon.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.858
Look, Lucy,

26:19.882 --> 26:22.557
have you ever done
anything really bad?

26:22.581 --> 26:25.975
I mean, evil?

26:27.803 --> 26:30.477
Something only you know about,

26:30.501 --> 26:34.307
but occasionally
rears its ugly head?

26:34.331 --> 26:37.160
I know I certainly have.

26:39.598 --> 26:43.752
Is it safe to say that
you have some secrets?

26:43.776 --> 26:47.146
Or regrets?

26:47.170 --> 26:49.085
Now let's just say that
none of that matters.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.761
How liberating would that be?

26:52.785 --> 26:54.676
Enough, Mr. Baddon.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.591
I'm afraid I have to ask
you to finish your meal

26:56.615 --> 26:59.115
and leave at once before
the Vicar arrives.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.900
Oh, he's not home, is he?

27:01.924 --> 27:04.555
Okay, I'll bite.

27:04.579 --> 27:05.817
So what then?

27:05.841 --> 27:08.820
Well, then, Ms. Bellerose,

27:08.844 --> 27:11.499
you would be all-powerful.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.697
You could do anything you want

27:15.721 --> 27:17.873
with no consequence.

27:17.897 --> 27:21.640
Death would be your only enemy.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.446
As long as you were alive,

27:26.470 --> 27:28.405
you would no longer
have to live in fear.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.103
Mr. Baddon, I beg of you.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.888
I'm sorry.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.977
My manners.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.066
It's just a spiel
that I'm perfecting

27:37.090 --> 27:39.155
to sell more policies.

27:39.179 --> 27:42.661
Thank you very much for
the meal, Miss Mary.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.816
And, Ms. Lucy,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.600
you will think about it, yes?

27:49.624 --> 27:52.690
Sorry. I don't plan on
dying anytime soon.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.673
No one ever does.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.005
Don't mind him, Mademoiselle.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.398
- The Vicar?
- No, Mr. Baddon.

28:05.422 --> 28:08.010
No, I know. I mean, you said
he was gone for the day?

28:08.034 --> 28:11.013
I'm afraid he's the only one
ordained in the whole parish.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.667
He will be gone most of the day.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.972
Cool.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.171
Excuse me.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.435
Thanks for lunch, by the way.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.405
Relax.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.954
This is my house.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.723
All right.

29:52.747 --> 29:53.811
I know when you guys see this,

29:53.835 --> 29:55.030
it won't be live,

29:55.054 --> 29:58.381
but I'm exploring this
really creepy castle

29:58.405 --> 30:00.015
that my family owns.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.951
They told me not
to come up here.

30:02.975 --> 30:05.586
Ooooh!

30:07.153 --> 30:10.175
If this is my last
post, please...

30:53.068 --> 30:54.983
Hello?

30:57.333 --> 30:58.900
Is anybody there?

31:01.033 --> 31:02.469
It's Lucy.

33:20.824 --> 33:21.825
Whoa.

34:24.235 --> 34:25.976
Ugh!

34:29.241 --> 34:30.719
What's the matter?

34:33.245 --> 34:36.137
Stay away.

34:36.161 --> 34:41.446
Lucy, please. I only
came back to get my hat.

34:41.469 --> 34:43.927
The chambermaid asked me
to come look for you.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.536
She was certain you strayed

34:45.561 --> 34:47.148
somewhere where you
shouldn't have.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.697
I said back away!

34:52.132 --> 34:53.806
Very well.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.355
I'll just give you a
moment to calm down.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.311
Lucy, I heard a scream.
Are you all right?

36:04.553 --> 36:05.661
I couldn't find anyone,

36:05.685 --> 36:07.228
so I just let myself in.

36:07.252 --> 36:10.318
Uh, it's... That's okay.
I just...

36:10.342 --> 36:11.580
I just finished burying your...

36:11.604 --> 36:13.669
I mean, I'm off work.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.584
I wanted to take you up
on that drink offer.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.542
Sounds like you could use one.

36:17.566 --> 36:20.545
Yeah. Yeah, I need to get
out of here for a minute.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.330
Are you sure you're okay?

36:22.354 --> 36:24.245
Yeah! Yeah, um...

36:24.269 --> 36:25.550
I just spooked myself.

36:25.574 --> 36:26.943
I do it a lot, actually.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.250
I'm a glutton for punishment.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.929
Um, so I just need a
minute to change.

36:48.597 --> 36:51.446
You ready?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.593
So what do you feel like?

37:08.617 --> 37:10.639
Mm, I'm still adjusting.

37:10.663 --> 37:14.556
No, I mean, uh, wine,
beer, coffee, tea?

37:14.580 --> 37:16.035
Or me?

37:16.059 --> 37:18.540
We gotta work on your jokes.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.391
No, seriously, two things.

37:23.415 --> 37:27.351
First, it's Europe, so
we drink at all hours.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.659
And, two, it gets dark
early this time of year,

37:30.683 --> 37:32.400
so let's make it a quick one.

37:32.424 --> 37:33.662
That's what she said.

37:33.686 --> 37:35.688
- Hmm?
- Never mind.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.407
J.P., can I ask you something?

37:39.431 --> 37:42.627
Sure, anything.

37:42.651 --> 37:44.760
Does this place seem
a little off to you?

37:44.784 --> 37:47.415
I'm not sure I follow, Lucy.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.068
I don't know. Ever
since I've been here,

37:49.092 --> 37:51.854
I just felt a little uneasy.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.663
Well, you've only been
here a couple of days.

37:55.664 --> 37:57.275
Ah, that way.

38:06.675 --> 38:09.654
I mean, I just... I don't know.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.569
Look, Lucy, I'm not gonna lie.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.311
Yes, the people around
here are a little weird.

38:14.335 --> 38:17.793
They're sheltered.

38:17.817 --> 38:21.492
And there's lots of
unpleasant history here.

38:21.516 --> 38:24.452
These families tend to
keep to themselves.

38:24.476 --> 38:28.325
I mean, I feel like I'm
being watched, or...

38:28.349 --> 38:30.458
I don't know. It's probably
just general discomfort.

38:30.482 --> 38:33.049
Come here. Follow me.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.473
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.672
Come on, let's go.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.264
Wow, it really is awesome.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.135
Isn't it?

38:56.159 --> 38:57.441
My grandfather proposed
to my grandmother here,

38:57.465 --> 38:58.921
so you could say that
if it wasn't for this,

38:58.945 --> 39:00.966
there'd be no me.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.751
Well, I guess that makes
it even more splendid.

39:02.775 --> 39:04.013
Naturally.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.580
This castle, for example.

39:05.604 --> 39:09.497
House Brandy, it has
a very dark past.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.871
All right, let's go see it.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.683
I guess what I was
saying earlier

39:21.707 --> 39:24.163
is that these people just have
no social skills, you know?

39:24.187 --> 39:26.122
Like simple conversations,

39:26.146 --> 39:27.863
and, oh, my God, door knocking.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.995
They say that these
houses built a fortune

39:30.019 --> 39:31.910
over the misfortune of others
during the Valais Witch Trials

39:31.934 --> 39:33.782
or the persecution
of the Sortilegia.

39:33.806 --> 39:35.174
I just keep seeing
this little girl.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.307
- What?
- What did you say?

39:37.331 --> 39:38.376
Come here.

39:47.733 --> 39:49.406
Can you describe this girl?

39:49.430 --> 39:51.669
What was that word...
Sorti... Sort...

39:51.693 --> 39:53.086
Sortilegia.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.462
Where did you find this book?

40:01.486 --> 40:02.811
In that damn castle.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.073
You found it?

40:04.097 --> 40:05.640
It was just lying around?

40:05.664 --> 40:07.666
This was no accident.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.299
Okay, come on, you're
not gonna get me

40:13.323 --> 40:15.563
with one of your bullshit
stories this time.

40:15.587 --> 40:18.392
Look, Lucy, don't
you find it strange

40:18.416 --> 40:21.569
that all this wealth and
power is historically rooted

40:21.593 --> 40:23.788
in what is essentially
a bunch of farmland?

40:23.812 --> 40:25.181
I guess so.

40:25.205 --> 40:28.706
Here? In the middle of nowhere?

40:28.730 --> 40:31.230
Countess Bathory's
got nothing on them.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.015
These people
literally flourished

40:33.039 --> 40:34.756
off the backs of
people like me...

40:34.780 --> 40:36.888
Gravediggers, farmers, peasants.

40:36.912 --> 40:40.588
And by "these people" you
mean people like me.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.285
Lucy, I didn't mean...

40:42.309 --> 40:44.505
No, tell me first, that word.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.984
Sortilegia.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.509
Those who practice black magic.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.598
Sorcerers, witches.

40:50.622 --> 40:54.515
Look, Lucy, the more
power, the more greed.

40:54.539 --> 40:58.344
This wealth paid for
in blood sacrifice.

40:58.368 --> 41:01.304
If you were a count
or a dame back then,

41:01.328 --> 41:03.088
you tortured people for fun.

41:03.112 --> 41:04.525
That's what they did.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.527
It's no secret. Look it up.

41:06.551 --> 41:09.007
But you don't actually believe
in this stuff, right?

41:09.031 --> 41:11.619
It doesn't matter if
I believe it or not.

41:11.643 --> 41:14.273
Look around. We're
surrounded by it.

41:14.297 --> 41:17.625
Castle Borley, House Brandy,
Dauphine, all of it.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.279
The legends are older
than the buildings.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.760
Don't you see that
once they got a taste,

41:22.784 --> 41:25.633
they couldn't get enough?

41:25.657 --> 41:27.765
Innocent souls in
exchange for wealth,

41:27.789 --> 41:31.010
power, and everlasting life.

41:32.968 --> 41:37.296
Look, I cannot make up for
the sins of my fathers,

41:37.320 --> 41:40.865
but I could but you a drink.

41:40.889 --> 41:42.824
I could definitely use one.

41:42.848 --> 41:46.852
- But the girl...
- I never actually saw her.

41:48.593 --> 41:49.942
Now I need a drink.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.225
You know, in all the
excitement, I forgot.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.663
I should at least try
and call my mom.

41:55.687 --> 41:58.187
It's okay. Your card can
help you with that.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.668
But first a truce. A drink?

42:00.692 --> 42:01.910
A drink.

42:21.713 --> 42:22.777
Don't mind them.

42:24.977 --> 42:26.607
Witch's Brew.

42:26.631 --> 42:29.479
Why not? I want to
give you a taste.

42:29.503 --> 42:32.245
Uh, just a local beer, please.

42:39.034 --> 42:40.708
You gotta be kidding me.

42:40.732 --> 42:42.124
Is this for real?

42:44.126 --> 42:45.171
Thanks.

42:46.738 --> 42:48.348
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.983
So, you never told
me about the girl.

42:55.007 --> 42:56.724
Yeah, it's weird.

42:56.748 --> 42:58.726
It's like I can feel her.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.292
Does she wear a white dress?

43:00.316 --> 43:01.642
So you do know her.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.165
A shot, please.

Um, sorry.

Drink.

50:33.900 --> 50:36.052
I... I was wondering, actually,

50:36.076 --> 50:39.708
if you could tell me how to get

50:39.732 --> 50:43.712
Mmm, Castle Borley.

50:43.736 --> 50:46.043
Mmm!

50:48.523 --> 50:49.631
The Borley curse

50:49.655 --> 50:51.328
and it's so great.

50:51.352 --> 50:54.201
Many centuries' wrath

50:54.225 --> 50:56.681

51:15.855 --> 51:19.617

doth the curse unbind.

51:19.641 --> 51:22.098
The Devil himself
partakes the feast.

51:22.122 --> 51:25.406
The squinter, the youth,
and the diabolic priest.

52:02.293 --> 52:03.511
Mademoiselle?

52:05.383 --> 52:07.646
Good morning, Madame.

52:09.430 --> 52:11.278
What?

52:11.302 --> 52:13.304
Madame, your sheets.

52:15.044 --> 52:16.089
Oh, my God.

52:17.699 --> 52:18.981
I... I already...

52:19.005 --> 52:21.050
It's okay. I'll take those.

52:22.182 --> 52:23.182
Um...

52:24.315 --> 52:25.944
Okay. Thanks.

52:25.968 --> 52:27.511
Can I have a moment, please?

52:27.535 --> 52:28.710
Of course.

53:26.855 --> 53:29.356
It's fine. I'm not hungry, Mom.

53:29.380 --> 53:31.077
Just come and sit here.

53:55.406 --> 53:57.906
I'm sorry about
Uncle Ricky, Mom.

53:57.930 --> 54:01.214
'Twas a terrible tragedy,

54:01.238 --> 54:03.085
but what can we do?

54:03.109 --> 54:05.087
Three funerals in as many weeks.

54:05.111 --> 54:07.394
I'm beginning to think
this place is cursed.

54:07.418 --> 54:09.613
Jean-Pierre, please.

54:09.637 --> 54:10.745
Don't.

54:10.769 --> 54:12.161
I'm sorry.

54:17.776 --> 54:19.406
I met a girl.

54:19.430 --> 54:21.408
Oh, really? Tell me more.

54:21.432 --> 54:24.672
- An American.
- Now, that is interesting.

54:24.696 --> 54:26.717
Where did you meet her?

54:26.741 --> 54:27.936
Castle Borley.

54:30.571 --> 54:31.853
What?

54:31.877 --> 54:33.985
You know about it, right?

54:34.009 --> 54:38.425
Of course, son. Just
another place is all.

54:38.449 --> 54:39.730
How so?

54:39.754 --> 54:43.168
Don't know much about it really,

54:43.192 --> 54:47.303
other than my mother was
scared to go there.

54:47.327 --> 54:49.068
Just kid stuff.

54:51.592 --> 54:53.986
Tell me more about this girl.

54:56.293 --> 55:00.447
Beautiful, headstrong,
different.

55:00.471 --> 55:02.449
Sounds American.

55:02.473 --> 55:04.451
I think I like her.

55:04.475 --> 55:06.303
Sounds like you.

55:08.174 --> 55:10.413
- Tsch!
- Jean-Pierre!

55:10.437 --> 55:12.850
I'm sorry, Mom. I just
realized I left her alone

55:12.874 --> 55:15.026
in a bar full of strange
men last night.

55:15.050 --> 55:16.463
I really should get going.

55:16.487 --> 55:17.942
Oh, off with you.

55:17.966 --> 55:20.510
I'll phone Serrano.

55:20.534 --> 55:22.338
Forgive me, Mom.

55:22.362 --> 55:24.427
And, again, I'm at a
loss about Uncle Ricky.

55:24.451 --> 55:26.516
I'll help with the
arrangements when, uh...

55:26.540 --> 55:27.735
It's okay, son.

55:27.759 --> 55:29.693
Life is for the living,

55:29.717 --> 55:32.261
so go and live it.

55:32.285 --> 55:34.635
There'll never been
another like you, Mom.

56:32.824 --> 56:35.759
Ew, gross. What is that?

56:35.783 --> 56:37.848
And what is he still doing here?

56:37.872 --> 56:40.634
Mary and the Vicar were kind
enough to offer me repose.

56:40.658 --> 56:42.529
I'm... I'm grateful.

56:49.014 --> 56:51.340
Do you seriously trust this guy?

56:51.364 --> 56:53.560
I thought there were no
guests allowed here.

56:53.584 --> 56:57.152
We were not going to just let
him wander the countryside.

57:07.902 --> 57:10.272
- Morning.
- And to you, young Jean.

57:10.296 --> 57:12.796
Might I trouble you for
a dozen roses, ma'am?

57:12.820 --> 57:14.494
I'm not sure which color.

57:14.518 --> 57:18.367
It depends on the intent,
now, doesn't it?

57:18.391 --> 57:19.586
A girl, is it?

57:19.610 --> 57:21.152
You devil, you.

57:21.176 --> 57:23.677
Then blood red it is.

57:23.701 --> 57:25.505
Who's the lucky girl?

57:25.529 --> 57:27.245
It's my right, you know,

57:27.269 --> 57:28.943
as you won't be coming
around here no more.

57:28.967 --> 57:30.684
No one can take your
place, Miss Montee.

57:30.708 --> 57:32.860
She's American, Bellerose clan.

57:32.884 --> 57:35.602
Rich? Or new royalty,
I should say.

57:35.626 --> 57:38.605
You know what they say
about boyars and ancients.

57:38.629 --> 57:40.563
I hope not dirty money.

57:40.587 --> 57:41.869
What do you mean?

57:41.893 --> 57:43.523
Jean-Pierre, don't be naive.

57:43.547 --> 57:45.176
People disappearing,

57:45.200 --> 57:47.004
rumblings of witchcraft.

57:47.028 --> 57:49.485
No one will even go to
House Borley no more

57:49.509 --> 57:52.183
- 'cause of its...
- Come on. Wives' tales.

57:52.207 --> 57:54.795
And like I said, she's American.

57:54.819 --> 57:56.318
I'll tell you what I know.

57:56.342 --> 57:58.363
That fire weren't
no wives' tale,

57:58.387 --> 58:00.365
and those people really died.

58:00.389 --> 58:04.369
The whole incestuous lot
of them, save the Count.

58:04.393 --> 58:07.024
And the only reason he
stuck around, they say,

58:07.048 --> 58:08.939
is by selling his soul.

58:08.963 --> 58:12.639
Come on, Miss Montee.
Whispers unbecoming of you.

58:12.663 --> 58:14.902
Get out of here, you playboy,

58:14.926 --> 58:17.687
before I steal you
right back from her.

58:17.711 --> 58:19.559
And save them lips for kissing

58:19.583 --> 58:22.324
that sweet mother of
yours, not rich Americans.

58:34.685 --> 58:36.663
What are you looking at?

58:36.687 --> 58:39.951
You work for me, remember that.

58:41.430 --> 58:43.539
Lucy, thank God. I'm so sorry.

58:43.563 --> 58:45.149
For what?

58:45.173 --> 58:47.064
About leaving you
alone last night.

58:47.088 --> 58:49.589
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, I just...

58:49.613 --> 58:50.851
That I can't take
care of myself?

58:50.875 --> 58:51.852
Because I'm a little girl?

58:51.876 --> 58:53.810
God.

58:53.834 --> 58:56.054
Where do you park your ego
and that big white steed?

59:02.321 --> 59:04.908
I just meant I was concerned.

59:04.932 --> 59:06.693
- A stranger in a...
- How is he?

59:06.717 --> 59:08.085
Who?

59:08.109 --> 59:09.546
The guy, the accident.

59:10.938 --> 59:12.568
He...

59:12.592 --> 59:14.527
He didn't make it.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.595
I...

59:18.772 --> 59:21.446
Oh, my God, I am
going crazy here.

59:21.470 --> 59:23.187
I'm hallucinating,

59:23.211 --> 59:25.059
and I'm being chased
by an imaginary girl,

59:25.083 --> 59:26.713
and... and I'm pretty sure
that I've been drugged

59:26.737 --> 59:28.715
and God knows what else.

59:28.739 --> 59:31.480
And these two are just
icing on the cake.

59:35.049 --> 59:36.723
Lucy, are you all right?

59:36.747 --> 59:39.726
Should I bring you to a doctor?

59:39.750 --> 59:41.684
That's perfect.

59:41.708 --> 59:43.599
She finally speaks her mind,
and she needs a doctor.

59:43.623 --> 59:45.340
That is perfect.

59:45.364 --> 59:46.907
I...

59:46.931 --> 59:49.649
- Are you...
- Shit!

59:49.673 --> 59:51.433
My purse, my stuff.

59:51.457 --> 59:52.565
Lucy, calm down.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.392
Where are you going?

59:54.416 --> 59:56.133
The woods. I think I
left my stuff somewhere.

59:56.157 --> 59:57.439
Shall I come with you?

59:57.463 --> 59:59.310
Fine, but at your own risk.

59:59.334 --> 01:00:00.684
And I don't need your help.

01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:03.967
Let's go.

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.776
Lucy!

01:00:10.824 --> 01:00:12.585
Where are we even going?

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.456
I'm going to try
and find my things

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.197
and figure out what the hell
is going on around here.

01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:17.981
You're not really
making any sense.

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:20.680
Look, I didn't mention
this, but I had an...

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:22.769
an encounter. I... I don't know.

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.771
That's the best way I can
think to describe it.

01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:26.773
- With who?
- Some old lady.

01:00:26.797 --> 01:00:28.905
I don't know. She... She
was speaking gibberish,

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:31.429
and I was drunk.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:33.344
Can you even remember
anything she said?

01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:35.956
Well, she went on some
crazy rant about a curse,

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.697
and she knew my name,

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:39.829
and I'm pretty sure
that she drugged me,

01:00:39.853 --> 01:00:42.005
and she has my stuff, so...

01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:45.095
So you are going to go to that
obviously crazy person's place

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.228
alone and just demand
your stuff back?

01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:49.273
Why don't you just
call the police?

01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:50.864
I can handle her.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.701
Here. This is it.

01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:09.729
Lucy, calm down.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:12.819
Let's not make it harder
than it already is.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.338
Hello?

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:50.030
I don't understand.
She's not here.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:52.317
But she was here!

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:58.995
Huh!

01:01:59.019 --> 01:02:00.997
Look! See?

01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:02.370
I told you.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.795
Where's my stuff?!

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.691
And this fucking book!
I am so sick of it!

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:22.715
Look, Lucy, this
doesn't prove anything

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.891
other than you were most
likely here last night.

01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:27.981
Well, how do you
explain it then?

01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:29.354
I wasn't that drunk.

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:35.379
All right, book, you
seem to be following me.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:38.058
Let's see what you have to say.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:46.216
What language is this?

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.915
It appears to be several.

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:51.961
Looks like some sort
of instruction manual.

01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:53.615
That's crazy.

01:02:53.639 --> 01:02:56.096
That sort of looks
like it's Hebrew.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.662
That is German.

01:02:57.686 --> 01:02:59.732
- Wait, go back.
- Wait, what?

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:03.843
There, Latin.

01:03:03.867 --> 01:03:05.845
I'm decent at Italian.

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:06.957
Let me give it a shot.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.764
Something about "die."

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.287
Like dying?

01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:15.115
No, like dice.

01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:16.662
Let me concentrate.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:21.948
Okay, so it's about
someone's prophecy.

01:03:21.972 --> 01:03:23.950
No, destiny.

01:03:23.974 --> 01:03:27.127
Uh, it's a detailed account
of something called

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:28.824
a black mass?

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:32.306
And it keeps mentioning
a Saint Walpurga.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.766
What does that even mean?

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.007
Apparently a chosen
one's lot is cast,

01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:39.879
and through a spell,

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.141
how do you say,

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:43.036
an incantation.

01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:46.494
It means something...

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:49.323
"Power through the death
of the innocents,

01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:51.020
everlasting life,"

01:03:51.044 --> 01:03:52.892
something, something,

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.067
"consecrated ground."

01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:55.764
Wait, what?

01:03:55.788 --> 01:03:58.051
Okay, hang on.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.293
This is clearly some sort of
dark ritual or something.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.383
Knowing the history around here,

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:09.865
sounds like someone is some
sort of demented hobbyist.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:12.999
Why does this even matter
so much to you anyway?

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:16.654
Look, J.P., I didn't
tell you this.

01:04:16.678 --> 01:04:19.005
I've never told anybody this,

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:25.315
but I've always had these
dark feeling inside,

01:04:25.339 --> 01:04:26.969
and I try to cover them up,

01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:28.952
because they're pretty
depressing, but...

01:04:30.736 --> 01:04:32.192
When I was a little girl,

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.847
and my mom used to
tell me stories,

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.588
I was always the one
rooting for the villain.

01:04:37.612 --> 01:04:41.027
I... I used to make out
with boys in cemeteries.

01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:44.030
I would try to hang out
outside of funeral homes,

01:04:44.054 --> 01:04:45.945
hoping to see a dead body.

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.405
Am I making any sense?

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.775
Look, for years,
I've tried to put on

01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:52.647
this perfect princess image.

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.867
I don't even fucking like pink.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.520
But then I got here,

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:57.870
and then this all just
came rushing back.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.741
What did?

01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:02.396
I don't know. The castle,
that girl, this book.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:06.443
It's... It's wrong,
but it feels right.

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:09.055
And from the moment I got here,

01:05:09.079 --> 01:05:10.665
I had this feeling of belonging,

01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:13.973
like déjà vu, but stronger.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:17.628
And... And I know that my
family history is here,

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:20.327
but it's like I knew the
layout of the castle

01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:24.070
before I even
walked in the door.

01:05:24.094 --> 01:05:25.593
You said it yourself.

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:27.247
Finding this book
was no accident.

01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:30.143
That's why I have
to figure this out.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.602
And I'm sorry about earlier.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:36.952
I was just really overwhelmed.

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:39.413
No need to explain.

01:05:45.115 --> 01:05:46.681
Devil be damned!

01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:49.834
You're not welcome here.

01:05:49.858 --> 01:05:51.532
Look, mister, we
don't mean any harm.

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:53.273
It's okay.

01:05:53.297 --> 01:05:55.623
My uncle is the Count
from Castle Borley.

01:05:55.647 --> 01:05:58.104
Your uncle was especially
not welcome here!

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:00.584
I'm glad that
slave-driver's dead.

01:06:00.608 --> 01:06:03.109
I'll be glad when the rest of
your devil-worshiping clan's

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:04.937
gone as well!

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:07.572
Feel free to follow him
in the grave, missy!

01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:13.970
And take your
witchcraft with you!

01:06:29.202 --> 01:06:31.876
- Man, that was crazy.
- Right.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.096
Where did that whack
job come from?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.142
"And take your
witchcraft with ya."

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:39.536
That must have been the
man you saw last night.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.538
No, it wasn't.

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:43.869
Oh, come on, Lucy, it has to be.

01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:50.895
Lucy, can I tell you something?

01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:52.095
Sure.

01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:59.339
I know we just met,

01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:01.080
but I can't stop
thinking about you,

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:04.779
and it's like I've
known you all my life.

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.389
And even this morning,

01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:08.652
I couldn't stop
wanting to see you.

01:07:08.676 --> 01:07:12.134
Even though I represent
all that you despise?

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:13.657
Maybe especially so.

01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:15.355
♪ All I wanted

01:07:15.379 --> 01:07:18.184
♪ Till I became you

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:20.186
♪ I'm not tryin' I'm not ♪

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.188

♪ I'm just kidding

01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:42.208
You think she's ready.

01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:44.384
Not quite yet.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:48.214
She needs to get over her denial
before we can approach her.

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:50.520
The waxing is not going
to wait for anyone.

01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:53.808
We already learned that
once the hard way.

01:07:55.941 --> 01:07:57.788
She's ready

01:07:57.812 --> 01:08:01.227
when I say she's ready.

01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:03.229
Prepare these.

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:05.231
Yes, My Lord.

01:08:05.255 --> 01:08:08.060
Sometimes you petulant
fools need to pay heed

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:12.238
to the proven wisdom
of a prudish old man.

01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:15.067
I have not managed to stay
around this place this long

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.243
without getting this right
a couple of times before.

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:20.550
And you have not managed
it all without us.

01:08:20.573 --> 01:08:23.031
And she's different.

01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:25.448
We've always known this
one would be harder.

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:28.296
Fool.

01:08:28.321 --> 01:08:31.300
Are you playing
devil or advocate?

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:33.259
Prophecy or none,

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:36.261
I will not so easily relinquish
my power to a woman,

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:38.264
much less a child.

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:40.613
You don't say the same of me?

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:43.399
Everyone knows this
is House of Borley,

01:08:43.423 --> 01:08:45.532
despite the name on the deed.

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:47.340
Take heed, sinners.

01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:50.276
It's your game, Vicar.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.692
Always has been.

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:03.288
Oh, Lucy, I think I lov...

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:04.290
Lucy?

01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:05.532
Lucy?

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.604
Lucy!

01:09:14.627 --> 01:09:16.935
Oh, I can't believe this.

01:09:22.854 --> 01:09:24.265
Hi.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:26.379
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:43.111
What's your name?

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:45.268
Do you live in the castle, too?

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.011
Lucy?

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.602
Hey, come here.

01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:41.628
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

01:10:43.413 --> 01:10:44.868
What's your name?

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:46.894
Have you been following me?

01:10:48.592 --> 01:10:52.398
♪ Little rose right
off the vine ♪

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:57.054
♪ Picked from God
right off the vine ♪

01:10:57.078 --> 01:11:00.754
♪ Careful not to
touch the thorn ♪

01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:03.346
Now she's ready.

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:08.936
What's the matter?
Don't you want it?

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.267
It's beautiful just like you.

01:11:14.618 --> 01:11:16.770
Who are you talking to?

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:19.816
A little girl, silly.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.407
Hey! Come back!

01:11:35.726 --> 01:11:37.249
Come here, little cutie.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:44.735
- Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

01:11:46.606 --> 01:11:48.367
Bloody bones on the first step.

01:11:48.391 --> 01:11:49.629
Can you hear him?

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:51.370
Lucy!

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:52.394
Damn it.

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.210
It's nothing.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:29.257
Bloody bones on the second step.

01:12:33.044 --> 01:12:35.133
You didn't even
tell me your name.

01:12:37.265 --> 01:12:38.484
Little girl!

01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:43.576
What am I doing here?

01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:51.367
Lucy?

01:12:53.978 --> 01:12:55.912
Can you hear him?

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:58.915
Bloody bones, dragging chains.

01:12:58.939 --> 01:13:01.527
Bloody bones getting
closer still.

01:13:16.566 --> 01:13:19.893
Bloody bones says...

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:22.548
Lucy.

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:24.443
Please be seated.

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:33.167
Miss Bellerose,

01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:35.474
I asked you not to come up here,

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:38.128
yet here you are.

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:44.308
In fact, you've done nothing
but mock us your entire visit.

01:13:44.332 --> 01:13:45.658
I...

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.877
I'm not here to admonish you.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:50.706
Quite the contrary.

01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:53.100
Where others see rebellion,

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:55.494
I see independence

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.712
and initiative.

01:13:56.736 --> 01:13:58.322
I don't understand.

01:13:58.346 --> 01:14:00.586
You may find this
hard to believe,

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:05.286
but you were invited here for
a very specific purpose.

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:07.791
The time has come to
bring you into the fold.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.884
Who is that little girl and
what have you done to her?

01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:17.603
She's my daughter.

01:14:17.627 --> 01:14:19.280
Rose.

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:23.913
And in a way, Lucille,

01:14:23.937 --> 01:14:25.461
you are, too.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:28.788
But I thought priests
weren't allowed to...

01:14:28.812 --> 01:14:30.529
They are not.

01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.182
Do not get distracted.

01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:34.097
What others call selfish,

01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:36.056
we call survival.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.626
You don't blame the wolf for
devouring the fawn, do you?

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:43.150
Lucy, look at me.

01:14:43.174 --> 01:14:46.936
This house, this
power, everything,

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.764
we are in danger
of losing it all.

01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:50.853
That's where you come in,

01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:54.640
but it comes at a price.

01:14:54.664 --> 01:14:56.163
I want no part of this,

01:14:56.187 --> 01:14:57.991
no matter what this is. Unh!

01:14:58.015 --> 01:15:00.689
We're not exactly
asking, little one.

01:15:00.713 --> 01:15:04.954
Besides, you're
already part of this.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:06.129
Enough.

01:15:06.153 --> 01:15:09.655
What he says is true.

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:12.440
It is a family tradition,

01:15:12.464 --> 01:15:13.659
your family.

01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:15.574
Our family.

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:20.796
Let's just say we've
used up our free passes,

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.363
but you?

01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:24.496
Ohh. You.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.759
- Let me go!
- No!

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:31.285
The life of just one innocent
extends ours immensely.

01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:34.027
The first one is
always the hardest.

01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:37.445
After then, you'll crave it.

01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:41.556
Aah!

01:15:51.938 --> 01:15:53.113
Unh!

01:15:54.724 --> 01:15:55.724
Santa Lucia...

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:13.066
By faith in he who
brings the light,

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:15.329
we swear allegiance

01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:20.726
and bequeath unto thee
this precious rose.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:23.946
Vanquish her innocence.

01:16:28.801 --> 01:16:31.563
Okay, one more, then
it's lights out.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.999
Okay, Lucille?

01:16:33.023 --> 01:16:34.851
- Okay, Mommy.
- Pinky swear?

01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:42.356
"Once upon a hill up high,"

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.445
there was a castle near the sky.

01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:47.883
Herein lived an evil man,
ruling with a heavy hand.

01:16:47.907 --> 01:16:50.277
Full of ego and pride,

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.758
against God's will,
he took a bride.

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:56.196
She bore to him a nephew son,

01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.546
and so the family curse begun.

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.375
The love for flesh
was oh so strong,

01:17:01.399 --> 01:17:04.160
and the son tradition
did carry on.

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:06.685
But his own child was never born

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:09.102
when for his sins, she did burn.

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:14.040
But selfishly, he continued on,

01:17:14.064 --> 01:17:15.911
taking lives to save his own.

01:17:15.935 --> 01:17:18.784
Until one day, the family spared

01:17:18.808 --> 01:17:21.308
by a newborn rose so fair.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:26.661
Only she and she alone her
father's sins can atone.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:30.186
But the decision to fight
must be solely hers,

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:33.823
"or else the family
be forever cursed."

01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:19.651
Lucy!

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:36.688
Lucy?

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.496
Is that you?

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.021
Oh!

01:19:08.091 --> 01:19:09.155
Lucy!

01:19:38.295 --> 01:19:39.775
Huh?

01:20:05.061 --> 01:20:08.194
Lucy, do not deny
your true nature.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.261
It's okay, Lucy.

01:20:12.285 --> 01:20:13.809
We're family, remember?

01:20:15.071 --> 01:20:16.962
Go to hell!

01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:19.007
We already have, dear.

01:20:22.948 --> 01:20:26.406
Lucille, we can grant you
a full and complete life,

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:28.887
if you'll only trust in us.

01:20:31.304 --> 01:20:32.610
Lucy?

01:20:37.006 --> 01:20:39.660
Lucy?

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:06.600
Shit!

01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:19.345
Aah!

01:22:26.115 --> 01:22:27.290
Oh!

01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:12.137
Saint Lucy?

01:23:52.636 --> 01:23:56.181
Lucy, so nice of you to join us.

01:23:59.599 --> 01:24:02.100
Shh, child.

01:24:02.124 --> 01:24:03.516
Join us.

01:24:18.227 --> 01:24:20.205
What's she saying?

01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:21.902
Please tell me what's going on.

01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:23.817
Please, oh, my God.
I'm falling apart.

01:24:23.841 --> 01:24:27.603
It's okay. She's not
herself right now.

01:24:27.627 --> 01:24:30.021
She calls out to
many before you.

01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:33.348
Kneel.

01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:42.816
Eat of my flesh.

01:24:52.609 --> 01:24:54.872
Drink of my blood.

01:25:01.531 --> 01:25:02.943
No!

01:25:02.967 --> 01:25:04.205
Silly girl.

01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:06.188
Don't make me angry.

01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:10.820
Won't you just go?

01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.518
Leave my house.

01:25:27.992 --> 01:25:30.449
O enlightened one,
thrown from Heaven

01:25:30.473 --> 01:25:32.799
for being brave and just,

01:25:32.823 --> 01:25:37.262
we invoke your assistance
in our time of abjection.

01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:43.505
We will not forget the
sacrifices that you made,

01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:47.466
and so unto you
make this sacrifice

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:49.318
in your honor.

01:26:08.728 --> 01:26:10.489
You want me to...

01:26:10.513 --> 01:26:12.317
I can't!

01:26:12.341 --> 01:26:16.693
Put your sister in him
out of her misery.

01:26:18.912 --> 01:26:21.132
She's not my sister!

01:26:36.887 --> 01:26:39.019
See? It is meant to be.

01:26:45.374 --> 01:26:47.352
Do not disobey.

01:26:59.388 --> 01:27:00.887
So you want to play, huh?

01:27:00.911 --> 01:27:02.652
You little bitch!

01:27:31.768 --> 01:27:33.267
I want you out of my house,

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:35.400
or so help me God,
I will kill you.

01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:37.097
Right spirit.

01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:38.949
Wrong lady.

01:27:40.907 --> 01:27:43.321
Lucy, stop resisting.

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:47.131
You know deep down how
this all plays out.

01:28:02.494 --> 01:28:04.994
He gave His only begotten son,

01:28:05.018 --> 01:28:06.431
and He's not selfish?

01:28:06.455 --> 01:28:07.997
But we take the weak,

01:28:08.021 --> 01:28:10.609
the downtrodden, and the lonely.

01:28:10.633 --> 01:28:12.437
And we are the evil ones?

01:28:12.461 --> 01:28:14.874
Then so be it.

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:17.485
We are the evil ones.

01:28:17.509 --> 01:28:20.401
Defy Him Lucille.

01:28:20.425 --> 01:28:21.663
Defy Him!

01:28:21.687 --> 01:28:24.840
Let the girl go!

01:28:24.864 --> 01:28:29.062
Lucy, she may appear innocent,

01:28:29.086 --> 01:28:32.631
but that little girl is the
only thing between you

01:28:32.655 --> 01:28:34.372
and life immortal.

01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:37.592
If I could promise
you a long life

01:28:37.616 --> 01:28:41.683
without remorse, without
guilt of any kind,

01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:43.294
wouldn't you take it?

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.470
That girl has already died.

01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:47.844
It is only the act
you need to do.

01:28:51.369 --> 01:28:53.391
God damn it, it isn't working!

01:28:53.415 --> 01:28:54.566
Silence.

01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:56.002
Lucy,

01:28:56.026 --> 01:28:58.221
we kill the pure of heart

01:28:58.245 --> 01:29:00.876
in order to replenish or home,

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.965
our families.

01:29:02.989 --> 01:29:07.448
Your family has been doing
it for generations.

01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:08.623
It's not about the wealth

01:29:08.647 --> 01:29:10.451
or the power.

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.453
Although that's nice, too.

01:29:12.477 --> 01:29:15.500
It's about having complete
reign over these weak fools.

01:29:15.524 --> 01:29:19.199
The constraints of
morality do not bind those

01:29:19.223 --> 01:29:21.767
who do not believe in
its very principles.

01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:24.813
We will not be held accountable

01:29:24.837 --> 01:29:28.275
by He whom you call God.

01:29:46.555 --> 01:29:48.184
Like Saint Lucille,

01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:50.361
I am blind to the
