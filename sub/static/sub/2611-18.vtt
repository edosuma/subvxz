WEBVTT

00:04.955 --> 00:07.499
CSI evidence disposal motorcade
heading onto Washington.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.584
Roger that.

00:09.584 --> 00:12.713
Proceed North on Robins, and
keep this channel open, please.

01:18.195 --> 01:19.446
Uh, CSI ...

01:19.446 --> 01:21.531
we have a funeral procession
making its way to you.

01:22.824 --> 01:24.910
Okay, let her pass.

01:39.841 --> 01:40.675
Kevlar...

01:40.675 --> 01:41.927
at a funeral?

01:42.761 --> 01:44.221
Everybody on alert.

01:52.521 --> 01:53.563
Oh, my god!

02:08.620 --> 02:10.205
Oh, my god, the baby!

02:18.922 --> 02:19.965
The baby!

02:24.302 --> 02:26.012
Get down! Oh, my God!
The baby!

02:28.098 --> 02:30.100
Lady, stay down!

02:33.228 --> 02:35.147
Get down!
Get down on the seat!

02:35.147 --> 02:36.189
The baby!

02:49.911 --> 02:51.371
Speed!
Speed!

02:52.539 --> 02:54.291
Hold on, buddy,
let me see it.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.500
My chest ...

02:56.543 --> 02:58.003
All right, hold on!

02:58.003 --> 03:01.298
Wait. Wait. Wait.
The kevlar caught it, man.

03:01.298 --> 03:02.215
Now, just breathe.

03:02.215 --> 03:03.133
Breathe easy.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.968
Keep breathing if you can.
Okay...

03:05.594 --> 03:08.096
Rescue!
Get me a rescue right now!

03:43.840 --> 03:46.968
1x18 Dispo Day

03:56.701 --> 03:58.912
B.P.'s one-forty
over a hundred.

03:59.954 --> 04:01.247
Chest contusion
from the impact

04:01.247 --> 04:03.708
of the projectile is what
took the wind out of him.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.710
If his lungs
were collapsed,

04:05.710 --> 04:07.003
he'd be blue by now.

04:07.003 --> 04:08.171
Okay, thank you.

04:09.130 --> 04:09.964
Hollis?

04:10.799 --> 04:11.883
No.

04:12.467 --> 04:13.510
You okay?

04:15.220 --> 04:16.053
I'm fine.

04:16.053 --> 04:17.137
All right.
I'll be right back.

04:17.137 --> 04:18.389
Hang in there.

04:19.098 --> 04:20.391
I shot out the tire.

04:20.391 --> 04:22.519
They should be within
a one-mile radius.

04:22.519 --> 04:24.229
Probably already
into a safe car.

04:24.229 --> 04:26.064
Let's check the street
for tread debris.

04:26.064 --> 04:27.065
Alexx ... ?

04:27.816 --> 04:29.651
Hollis got one in the head.

04:30.568 --> 04:32.570
You can tell his family
he went quick.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.364
Shouldn't have
to tell them at all.

04:34.364 --> 04:35.281
Don't I know it.

04:35.281 --> 04:36.658
The mother and little boy?

04:36.658 --> 04:38.284
Kid checked out fine.

04:38.284 --> 04:40.328
Mother got shot,
upper humerus.

04:40.328 --> 04:41.371
They're at a clinic.

04:41.371 --> 04:44.290
She says to tell you thank you.
Wants to bake you a cake.

04:44.582 --> 04:45.583
Gave her my address.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.960
All right, thanks, man.
Thanks for your help.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.294
Detective,

04:48.294 --> 04:51.005
... five hundred dispo's
we've never had a problem.

04:51.464 --> 04:52.841
You take the dope
out of evidence,

04:52.841 --> 04:54.634
re-analyze it to make
sure nobody pulled ...

04:54.634 --> 04:56.594
a switcheroo and then
cart it across town?

04:57.011 --> 04:58.847
We should just burn it at CSI.

04:58.930 --> 05:02.433
Remind me to order the
industrial-size incinerator next time.

05:02.433 --> 05:04.811
Dispo route's classified.
Somebody was in on the secret.

05:04.811 --> 05:07.355
No such thing as a secret
in Miami, Detective.

05:07.772 --> 05:09.858
Only useful information.

05:13.403 --> 05:14.237
It's creepy.

05:14.237 --> 05:15.738
The engine's still running.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.407
You ought to be there in
the middle of the night ...

05:17.407 --> 05:19.367
when we pull one of these
things out of the water ...

05:19.367 --> 05:22.370
with the radio still on.
Talk about creepy.

05:24.330 --> 05:25.498
Car's stolen.

05:25.707 --> 05:26.499
Based on ... ?

05:26.499 --> 05:28.585
Based on the screwdriver
in the ignition.

05:33.423 --> 05:34.507
Without the key...

05:36.176 --> 05:38.470
... the screwdriver
completes the circuit.

05:42.807 --> 05:45.643
Well, stealing cars
is their side job.

05:45.643 --> 05:47.103
This is a death talon.

05:49.189 --> 05:50.690
They don't sell those anymore.

05:50.773 --> 05:53.318
Haven't been sold
commercially since '96 or '97.

05:53.318 --> 05:55.361
They must have been
stockpiling their bullets.

05:55.361 --> 05:56.446
It's hard-core.

05:56.779 --> 05:58.406
I'll post this guy first.

05:58.406 --> 06:00.283
C.O.D. seems pretty
clear to me.

06:00.283 --> 06:03.786
Don't need an autopsy to ascertain
our fake cop's physical condition.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.663
Uh-uh, prison buff.

06:05.663 --> 06:08.124
I'll print him, get his
prints to Delko for AFIS.

06:08.124 --> 06:09.959
See if I can get
you a release date.

06:09.959 --> 06:11.211
Okay.

06:12.253 --> 06:14.005
Here comes your
favorite reporter.

06:15.048 --> 06:16.674
Enrique Rayas, in the field.

06:16.674 --> 06:17.926
Lieutenant Caine,

06:17.926 --> 06:19.511
a drug-related shoot-out
in the streets of Miami.

06:19.511 --> 06:21.387
Any sense of dÃ©ja vu
once-removed?

06:21.387 --> 06:23.389
You're about to make a mistake
you don't want to make.

06:23.389 --> 06:24.474
Just drawing a parallel here.

06:24.474 --> 06:27.268
Your brother gave his life in
the line of duty two years ago,

06:27.268 --> 06:28.812
albeit under much
cloudier circumstances.

06:28.812 --> 06:30.104
Circumstances
weren't cloudy.

06:30.104 --> 06:31.856
The reporting was.

06:31.856 --> 06:33.358
You know what?
Get rid of him.

06:33.358 --> 06:34.192
Back behind the tape.

06:34.192 --> 06:35.235
Okay, okay, okay.

06:36.277 --> 06:38.196
Rubber took us
to some buildings.

06:38.196 --> 06:40.281
Homeless guy saw our
truck near a pier.

06:40.573 --> 06:41.616
Let's check it out.

07:09.352 --> 07:10.812
Nobody's home,
gentlemen.

07:15.775 --> 07:17.735
Heroin, weed, meth.

07:18.027 --> 07:19.779
Hell, they left the
drugs behind.

07:20.405 --> 07:22.198
Everything but the cocaine.

07:22.198 --> 07:23.491
Doesn't make any sense.

07:23.491 --> 07:25.493
There's millions of dollars
worth of drugs here.

07:25.702 --> 07:28.663
Well, maybe the flattened
tire forced a change in plans.

07:28.872 --> 07:30.665
Yeah, they took only
what they could carry.

07:30.665 --> 07:32.667
Yes, they did ,
direct to their buyer.

07:32.667 --> 07:33.918
The question is who.

07:33.918 --> 07:34.752
Hey, H.

07:34.752 --> 07:35.753
Yeah.

07:36.796 --> 07:38.006
What do you got, Speed?

07:40.091 --> 07:41.384
Well, looks like they
changed clothes.

07:41.384 --> 07:43.052
That's a fake uniform.

07:43.052 --> 07:44.012
Wait a second.

07:44.429 --> 07:46.556
It's a laundry tag
from a dry cleaners.

07:46.764 --> 07:49.392
Sweat on these clean uniforms,
we'll get their DNA.

07:49.392 --> 07:50.977
There's also blood in the cab.

07:50.977 --> 07:53.104
One of our suspects is wounded.

07:53.313 --> 07:55.482
I'll track it down.
All right, sounds good.

07:56.524 --> 07:57.609
Speed ...

07:58.651 --> 08:00.028
there's a blood trail.

08:02.822 --> 08:05.074
So he got out of the
truck over there,

08:05.074 --> 08:06.993
and ended up in
what was probably ...

08:06.993 --> 08:08.786
a getaway vehicle
over here.

08:15.835 --> 08:19.881
And his wound was
from an extremity.

08:20.924 --> 08:23.009
Okay, let's broadcast it.

08:33.394 --> 08:34.562
That's weird.

08:34.562 --> 08:35.938
That's Speedle's gun.

08:35.938 --> 08:38.942
Yeah, the magazine's full.
One in the chamber.

08:39.984 --> 08:41.486
He didn't fire any rounds?

08:41.486 --> 08:44.030
I don't know.
Maybe it's a second magazine.

08:44.239 --> 08:45.448
None of this is official.

08:45.448 --> 08:47.408
Not until I finish
processing the scene.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.787
I'm not saying anything.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.706
Yeah, I think it's best not to.

08:59.420 --> 09:00.839
Tim, hey.

09:02.090 --> 09:04.008
Heard it was the wild west
out there today.

09:06.928 --> 09:09.180
See if you can get
some DNA off of those.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.184
Smells like I will.

09:15.270 --> 09:17.981
I'll start with collars and cuffs.
You want to sign here?

09:20.900 --> 09:23.319
So everyone says that Hollis
would have gotten much worse ...

09:23.319 --> 09:25.363
if it hadn't been for you
pulling him out of the truck.

09:25.363 --> 09:26.948
He died, Laura.

09:26.948 --> 09:28.032
I know that.

09:28.241 --> 09:30.368
But his family can have
an open casket,

09:30.368 --> 09:32.495
and that means more
than you might think.

09:32.829 --> 09:34.247
You were brave.

09:34.247 --> 09:35.999
I wasn't brave.
I reacted ...

09:35.999 --> 09:38.084
badly. Okay?

09:39.127 --> 09:40.253
Okay.

09:40.253 --> 09:41.588
I'll page you with the results.

09:41.588 --> 09:43.131
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

09:46.676 --> 09:48.511
Well, look what the
cat dragged in.

09:50.305 --> 09:52.098
SWAT lost a man today.

09:52.223 --> 09:55.310
Yes, and officer Hollis left
two small children behind.

09:55.435 --> 09:58.521
Well, that's a real tragedy.
SWAT guys cost more to train.

09:58.521 --> 10:00.190
We're talking half
a million bucks here.

10:00.190 --> 10:03.860
So Internal Affairs does place a
dollar value on employees' lives.

10:03.985 --> 10:06.654
Somebody along the food
chain talked about Dispo Day.

10:06.654 --> 10:08.281
Can't put one
past you, Jack.

10:08.281 --> 10:10.783
Speedle requested
the assignment, correct?

10:10.783 --> 10:12.702
Yes, he did, and I approved
his request.

10:12.702 --> 10:15.997
So if you'll excuse me, I have
an investigation to process.

10:15.997 --> 10:17.165
So do I.

10:17.165 --> 10:18.833
Starting with CSI.

10:22.378 --> 10:26.090
Well, talk about a waste
of the taxpayers' money, Jack.

10:26.090 --> 10:28.259
You know, I came to tell
you as a courtesy.

10:28.259 --> 10:30.345
IAB's not asking permission.

10:30.345 --> 10:32.055
I'm going to poly all your CSIs.

10:32.055 --> 10:34.599
You poly them,
you better poly me first.

10:34.599 --> 10:37.477
I would, if I thought
you leaked anything.

10:37.477 --> 10:39.312
Tell them no nicotine
and no caffeine.

10:39.312 --> 10:41.147
That'll only hurt 'em
once they're wired up.

10:41.147 --> 10:42.315
Hey, Jack.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.985
You miss being a real cop?

10:46.319 --> 10:48.154
You're just full of
them today, aren't you?

10:48.446 --> 10:49.906
You have no idea.

10:54.108 --> 10:56.986
A veritable shoot-out in
downtown Miami this morning.

10:56.986 --> 10:59.614
Old drug evidence was
moved in a top-secret transport.

10:59.614 --> 11:00.657
Two officers killed.

11:00.657 --> 11:02.575
An internal investigation
is underway ...

11:02.575 --> 11:05.370
in an attempt to determine
how the information was leaked.

11:05.370 --> 11:06.955
You're the investigator
in the dispo case ...

11:06.955 --> 11:08.748
that resulted in
two tragic deaths.

11:08.748 --> 11:11.042
You mind if I ask you a few
questions for our viewers?

11:11.125 --> 11:12.168
Yeah.

11:17.841 --> 11:19.384
Saw your friend out front.

11:19.384 --> 11:20.635
Guy thinks he's Tom Brokaw.

11:20.635 --> 11:23.096
If he's Tom Brokaw,
I'm Elliot Ness.

11:23.096 --> 11:26.474
So, you talk to the owner
of the incinerator?

11:26.474 --> 11:27.559
Yeah, he's bummed.

11:27.559 --> 11:29.060
No dope burn.
No money.

11:29.269 --> 11:30.812
What about the dry-cleaners?

11:30.812 --> 11:31.980
Owners thought it was vandalism.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.730
They replaced the glass,

11:32.730 --> 11:34.858
cleaned up the mess and
they're back in business.

11:34.858 --> 11:36.985
I need one of your CSIs
over there for prints.

11:36.985 --> 11:38.862
Wait a second.
When was their break-in?

11:39.904 --> 11:41.155
Ten days ago.

11:42.198 --> 11:44.659
About the same time we
decided to dispo the dope.

11:45.076 --> 11:47.453
Ooh, media will be
all over that.

11:47.787 --> 11:50.582
Well, even sharks
got to eat, right?

11:54.127 --> 11:55.211
Ah-ah.

11:55.211 --> 11:56.629
Cola has caffeine.

11:57.672 --> 11:58.923
Oh, you're right.

11:59.340 --> 12:00.300
Thank you.

12:00.717 --> 12:01.718
Nervous?

12:02.135 --> 12:03.761
Well, I figured if I passed
the polygraph ...

12:03.761 --> 12:05.013
that got me through
the Academy,

12:05.013 --> 12:06.806
it'd be smooth sailing.

12:06.806 --> 12:07.932
You?

12:07.932 --> 12:10.310
Nuh-uh. Stuff like this
makes me feel guilty.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.478
Why do you feel guilty when
you haven't done anything?

12:12.478 --> 12:13.855
I'm Catholic.
I don't know.

12:13.855 --> 12:15.356
I always feel guilty.

12:15.857 --> 12:17.400
Don't worry about your
religion in the chair ...

12:17.400 --> 12:21.571
because the poly picks up
discomfort, not the truth.

12:21.571 --> 12:23.239
Did you recover my weapon?

12:23.239 --> 12:24.199
Yeah.

12:25.241 --> 12:28.036
So you're going to shave
before you go to IAB?

12:28.036 --> 12:31.164
It's a polygraph test,
not a portrait.

12:31.164 --> 12:33.291
Well, you know,
presentation is everything.

12:34.125 --> 12:35.084
Who's first?

12:36.127 --> 12:38.713
Jack Seeger, IAB.
Who's first?

12:38.713 --> 12:40.715
I've got a lab full
of evidence.

12:42.175 --> 12:43.218
DNA.

12:45.094 --> 12:47.013
I guess that means me, Jack.

12:48.348 --> 12:50.183
How did we do on
soccer mom's car?

12:50.183 --> 12:52.560
I haven't even gotten to it.
I'm still logging in evidence.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.229
Hey, do you know
this Seeger guy?

12:54.229 --> 12:56.814
I do. He's IAB, so be
careful what you say to him.

12:56.814 --> 12:59.234
You stay with ballistics.
I'll stay with the car, all right?

12:59.234 --> 13:01.277
Transpo towed it to the garage.
It's probably already there.

13:01.277 --> 13:02.779
Keep me posted.
Okay.

13:03.821 --> 13:05.698
This will record your breathing.

13:33.643 --> 13:35.728
This will record your perspiration.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.944
And this measures your heartbeat.

13:46.281 --> 13:48.241
Did I mention I was catholic?

13:51.369 --> 13:52.704
Were you born in Miami?

13:52.704 --> 13:53.788
Yes.

13:55.248 --> 13:58.001
What is 4 x 6 + 3?

13:58.209 --> 14:01.045
Twenty-seven.
Why a math problem?

14:01.171 --> 14:03.298
Mental calculations
record as a lie.

14:04.132 --> 14:06.217
So you have to think
to calculate?

14:06.426 --> 14:07.927
Calculate to lie?

14:10.346 --> 14:13.349
Have you ever lied to someone
who loved and trusted you?

14:14.601 --> 14:15.685
Yes.

14:17.145 --> 14:18.313
Recently?

14:19.355 --> 14:20.273
Yes.

14:20.273 --> 14:21.816
Was it work-related?

14:23.693 --> 14:24.736
No.

15:14.285 --> 15:15.411
That's a death talon.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.419
So Lynn Martell,

15:24.921 --> 15:27.173
had a wound to the
left shoulder, didn't she?

15:27.173 --> 15:28.341
Could be from a ricochet.

15:28.341 --> 15:29.801
Or a graze.

15:35.265 --> 15:36.808
Okay, but take a look at this.
See?

15:36.808 --> 15:39.352
Okay, the trajectory is
through the driver's seat ...

15:39.352 --> 15:41.896
which means it originated
from behind the car.

15:44.399 --> 15:46.276
Man, they're lucky they
didn't hit the baby.

15:48.695 --> 15:50.405
You have kids,
Frank, right?

15:50.405 --> 15:51.489
Three.

15:52.031 --> 15:54.868
And what is the condition
of your family vehicle?

15:55.201 --> 15:56.411
It's a war zone.

15:56.411 --> 15:58.705
French fries, broken toys,
candy wrappers.

15:58.705 --> 16:00.206
I'm always on the
wife about that.

16:00.206 --> 16:04.085
In this case, the lack
of evidence is evidence.

16:04.085 --> 16:05.211
Too clean?

16:05.545 --> 16:07.380
Too clean.

16:08.423 --> 16:09.507
"The baby".

16:10.216 --> 16:12.468
The baby!
The baby!

16:14.137 --> 16:18.391
She kept screaming "The Baby,
The Baby," not "My Baby."

16:18.391 --> 16:20.768
Ah, heat of the moment,
people say all kinds of things.

16:20.768 --> 16:22.854
Let's go see what she
has to say now.

16:28.776 --> 16:29.986
How's your son?

16:29.986 --> 16:32.197
He's, uh-uh, he's fine.

16:33.448 --> 16:34.991
What day of the week
was he born?

16:34.991 --> 16:37.619
Oh, I think a Friday.

16:38.661 --> 16:39.746
You think?

16:43.082 --> 16:45.084
He's not your kid, is he?

16:46.127 --> 16:48.838
Is he your nephew, neighbor's?

16:54.511 --> 16:56.054
How's your arm?

16:56.054 --> 16:57.180
Fine.

16:58.431 --> 17:00.725
Police records have you
in three serious accidents ...

17:00.725 --> 17:02.810
in the past
fifteen months.

17:02.977 --> 17:04.729
You use the same
doctor for all of them?

17:04.729 --> 17:05.480
Yeah.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.608
See, if we can prove that
you were paid to hit that car,

17:08.608 --> 17:10.693
we can charge you
with murder one.

17:15.198 --> 17:18.034
I didn't know that there was
going to be a shooting.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.619
I got paid five
thousand dollars ...

17:20.619 --> 17:21.954
to wait for the
funeral procession,

17:21.954 --> 17:23.580
then slam into
the hearse.

17:23.580 --> 17:27.292
And in our world they call
that an insurance scam.

17:27.292 --> 17:28.753
So who set it up?
The doctor?

17:28.753 --> 17:29.712
Somebody else contacted him,

17:29.712 --> 17:31.756
and-and he wouldn't be
involved in any shooting.

17:31.756 --> 17:33.842
But somebody was
shooting at you.

17:33.842 --> 17:36.261
We have the forensics
to prove it.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.894
Maybe that was a mistake.

17:44.894 --> 17:48.273
Trajectory says it was intentional.

17:48.898 --> 17:52.026
So why don't you
give me a name?

17:58.700 --> 18:00.535
Dr. Guillermo Santoyo.

18:01.578 --> 18:04.122
Did you know that the
state of Florida has ...

18:04.122 --> 18:08.209
the highest percentage of
unlicensed doctors in the U.S.?

18:08.543 --> 18:09.544
No.

18:09.544 --> 18:10.962
How'd you lose yours?

18:10.962 --> 18:14.591
I didn't report a gunshot
victim I treated once.

18:14.591 --> 18:15.925
Harsh punishment.

18:16.968 --> 18:18.761
Well, it wasn't my first time.

18:18.761 --> 18:20.805
So the ex-cons must love you.

18:22.473 --> 18:25.560
I treat a lot of
poor Miami families.

18:25.977 --> 18:28.188
I charge just what
they can pay.

18:28.188 --> 18:30.565
Not having a license
hasn't changed my ability ...

18:30.565 --> 18:31.816
to treat sick people.

18:31.816 --> 18:34.194
So you're one of
the good guys.

18:34.194 --> 18:35.320
Is that it?

18:36.946 --> 18:37.989
Okay.

18:38.031 --> 18:40.992
Would you mind
if I looked around?

18:42.660 --> 18:43.661
Go ahead.

18:44.496 --> 18:45.538
Thank you.

19:31.918 --> 19:33.419
Police-issue ammo.

19:33.753 --> 19:35.213
Who'd you pull this out of?

19:37.715 --> 19:40.093
Officers are dead, and
you're an accessory.

19:40.301 --> 19:41.970
Now who the hell did
you pull it out of?

19:47.851 --> 19:49.269
Lester Cassidy.

19:49.352 --> 19:51.062
They bring Cassidy
in this morning?

19:51.062 --> 19:52.105
Yeah.

20:00.947 --> 20:02.657
He was bleeding
from a leg wound.

20:02.657 --> 20:04.659
They threatened to kill
me if I didn't help.

20:05.076 --> 20:06.411
So you took this bullet
out of him.

20:06.411 --> 20:08.663
Yeah, but I told them
to take him to a hospital.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.874
He lost so much blood.
He was in shock.

20:10.874 --> 20:12.041
Where do you think
they took him?

20:12.041 --> 20:13.334
One of them said, uh,

20:13.668 --> 20:16.212
something about dumping
him at the Hialeah.

20:17.255 --> 20:18.381
I know where that is.

20:39.986 --> 20:41.654
Tell us where
your partners are.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.116
Lester,

20:45.116 --> 20:48.328
do you think that your friends
are coming back for you?

20:49.162 --> 20:51.080
I think they left you
here to die,

20:51.080 --> 20:54.542
so why don't you tell me who
put this whole thing together?

20:54.542 --> 20:55.335
This guy's going fast.

20:55.335 --> 21:00.048
No, you don't.
No, no, you don't.

21:01.591 --> 21:03.092
I want a name from you.

21:04.761 --> 21:05.803
Lester,

21:05.803 --> 21:08.223
is this guy worth dying for?

21:08.223 --> 21:12.185
Why don't you give me
something to get him with?

21:13.811 --> 21:15.438
Nedir.

21:16.481 --> 21:17.607
What was that?

21:19.692 --> 21:22.946
Nedir ... Kire.

21:31.803 --> 21:34.222
Heard Laura got some
DNA off those uniforms.

21:34.931 --> 21:35.974
We get any names?

21:35.974 --> 21:37.100
Almost.

21:38.977 --> 21:39.894
You talk to Speed?

21:39.894 --> 21:42.063
Yeah.
He's on the box right now.

21:42.188 --> 21:43.606
How'd that go for you?

21:43.606 --> 21:45.275
I'm just glad it's over.

21:45.483 --> 21:46.860
They ask you about
your girlfriend?

21:46.860 --> 21:48.361
H, you know I don't
have a girlfriend.

21:48.361 --> 21:49.696
No girlfriend this week?

21:49.696 --> 21:52.657
The girl I'm seeing, I'm glad
she doesn't have a polygraph.

21:52.866 --> 21:54.367
Hey, got it.

21:54.367 --> 21:56.202
Cesar Rubio and
Mike Tooley.

21:56.536 --> 21:58.371
Let's see where they've
been hanging out.

21:59.205 --> 22:01.833
They shared a floor at
Raiford State Penitentiary.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.169
Got a driver, ...

22:04.169 --> 22:05.753
... sharpshooter, ...

22:05.753 --> 22:07.839
... explosives expert, ...

22:07.839 --> 22:08.548
... drug dealer ...

22:08.548 --> 22:09.966
... and a tactical man.

22:09.966 --> 22:12.594
Ex-con dream team.
Missing only ...

22:12.594 --> 22:13.970
... a buyer.

22:14.179 --> 22:16.556
Yes.
Nedir Kire.

22:17.098 --> 22:17.891
Who?

22:17.891 --> 22:20.810
Dying declaration by our
friend Cassidy up there.

22:21.352 --> 22:23.855
Nedir Kire.
What is that, Farsi?

22:23.855 --> 22:24.939
I don't know.

22:25.482 --> 22:27.609
So, this Nedir is our buyer?

22:27.609 --> 22:29.402
He's the man behind it all?
Could be.

22:29.402 --> 22:31.988
So, let's run his name through
county property records,

22:31.988 --> 22:34.532
white pages, yellow pages,
IRS if you have to.

22:34.532 --> 22:36.534
But you know what,
start with ... inmate records.

22:36.534 --> 22:37.577
You got it.

22:59.516 --> 23:00.600
Bad guys.

23:03.144 --> 23:04.687
Good guys.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.774
I recovered a 122 pieces
of firearms evidence.

23:07.774 --> 23:08.858
Good work.

23:09.484 --> 23:10.527
Thank you.

23:10.527 --> 23:11.486
Well, you know what they say.

23:11.486 --> 23:13.154
You don't really know
who you are until ...

23:13.154 --> 23:14.823
All hell breaks loose.

23:15.448 --> 23:18.409
So our round count on our two
swat officers was fifty-four.

23:18.409 --> 23:20.245
Of that, I got 45 casings.

23:20.245 --> 23:21.621
Those are shown in blue.

23:21.621 --> 23:23.957
Talk about bullets.
There were 12.

23:23.957 --> 23:26.459
We dug them out
of the hearse,

23:26.459 --> 23:28.670
trees, buildings,
several cars.

23:28.670 --> 23:30.171
It was the usual yield.

23:30.171 --> 23:33.800
Three-fourths of the casings,
one-fourth of the bullets.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.094
The ex-cons used tec-9s,
didn't they?

23:36.094 --> 23:37.303
That's correct--
death talons.

23:37.303 --> 23:39.222
And those are shown
here in red.

23:39.222 --> 23:42.517
Now, of that, I got 40 casings
and 18 projectiles.

23:42.517 --> 23:45.270
One of which fatally
killed Officer Hollis.

23:45.687 --> 23:46.813
Anything else?

23:50.567 --> 23:52.819
The green triangles are
actually rounds  ...

23:52.819 --> 23:54.737
that I matched
to your weapon.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.823
Seven total, not
including the round ...

23:56.823 --> 23:58.408
that you pulled out
of Laskey's head ...

23:58.408 --> 24:00.118
or the one that came out
of the doctor's office.

24:00.118 --> 24:02.996
So, it turns out you're
a good shot.

24:03.413 --> 24:04.956
What about Speedle's 9?

24:06.291 --> 24:07.375
That is ongoing.

24:07.375 --> 24:10.587
I haven't matched any projectiles
or casings to his weapon yet,

24:10.587 --> 24:12.255
but I'm not finished
with the report.

24:12.672 --> 24:13.715
Okay.

24:14.007 --> 24:14.758
Anything else?

24:14.758 --> 24:16.801
Well, I've saved
the best for last.

24:16.801 --> 24:19.220
You know the bullet you pulled
out of Lynn Martell's car?

24:19.763 --> 24:22.515
Trajectory from
the final position ...

24:22.515 --> 24:25.393
turns out is from
across the street.

24:25.393 --> 24:27.061
We have a mystery shooter.

24:27.061 --> 24:29.397
So, our crime scene
just got a lot bigger.

24:29.397 --> 24:30.482
Okay, you know what?

24:30.482 --> 24:32.275
Get Tripp and
go back over there.

24:32.275 --> 24:33.693
Nice work.
Thanks.

24:34.527 --> 24:36.863
Did you come here
intending to lie?

24:36.863 --> 24:38.031
No.

24:40.116 --> 24:43.203
Did you take part in an
officer-involved shooting yesterday?

24:43.745 --> 24:45.580
Your phraseology is misleading.

24:45.580 --> 24:47.040
Please answer "yes" or "no."

24:47.040 --> 24:48.374
Please rephrase the question.

24:48.374 --> 24:49.709
If you fail to cooperate...

24:49.709 --> 24:51.586
Was I involved in a shoot-out?

24:51.586 --> 24:52.670
Yeah.

24:53.213 --> 24:55.340
Was an officer killed?
Yes.

24:56.174 --> 25:00.011
Did you disclose any information
regarding the narcotics transport?

25:02.138 --> 25:03.306
No.

25:04.682 --> 25:07.185
The officer riding next to
you was shot in the head.

25:07.393 --> 25:09.437
Was his name Officer Hollis?

25:09.979 --> 25:11.106
Yes.

25:11.314 --> 25:12.982
Were you shot in the chest?

25:13.608 --> 25:14.359
Yes.

25:14.359 --> 25:16.736
Did your vest protect you
from serious injury?

25:16.736 --> 25:17.779
Yes.

25:19.239 --> 25:22.450
Did the suspects have any
reason to kill Officer Hollis ...

25:23.493 --> 25:25.036
but only wound you?

25:35.004 --> 25:36.589
You know what?
This game's over.

25:40.635 --> 25:41.428
Sorry,

25:41.428 --> 25:44.013
but I have an officer-involved
case to investigate.

25:44.013 --> 25:46.099
So I don't have time
for this petty crap.

25:52.897 --> 25:54.816
Hey, can I talk to you
for just a second?

25:54.816 --> 25:56.359
It's not really
a good time.

25:56.359 --> 25:58.945
Well, I just wanted to talk
to you before I ...

25:58.945 --> 25:59.904
Before what?

25:59.904 --> 26:02.198
Before I sent
Horatio my report.

26:03.533 --> 26:05.452
Look, my gun
misfired, okay?

26:05.452 --> 26:06.661
I admit it.

26:06.661 --> 26:09.372
It misfired because
I didn't clean it.

26:09.372 --> 26:11.958
That's why it jammed up,
and that's why Hollis is dead.

26:11.958 --> 26:13.293
Okay?
And I should probably resign.

26:13.293 --> 26:14.586
That is not true.
That was an ambush,

26:14.586 --> 26:16.045
he was shot from
the left-hand side,

26:16.045 --> 26:17.922
and there was nothing that
you could have done about it.

26:17.922 --> 26:18.923
Well, I feel like there was.

26:18.923 --> 26:20.133
There wasn't.

26:20.133 --> 26:22.635
And all I'm saying is next time
it could be you, and I'm just ...

26:22.635 --> 26:25.221
I'm just begging you,
clean your gun.

26:28.391 --> 26:29.476
I get it.

26:30.393 --> 26:31.770
Listen, uh ...

26:31.770 --> 26:33.605
you shouldn't have to be
the one to tell Horatio.

26:33.605 --> 26:35.607
I'll do it, okay?
Okay.

26:36.191 --> 26:38.443
Ms. Duquesne, you're up.

26:38.860 --> 26:41.404
I've got one more knock-and-talk,
and then I'm all yours.

26:41.404 --> 26:42.947
Don't make me call
Lieutenant Caine.

26:42.947 --> 26:45.658
I wouldn't make my L.T.
take a call from you.

26:54.542 --> 26:55.710
Get any prints?

26:57.796 --> 26:59.506
Well, we've got
good ridge structure,

26:59.506 --> 27:02.926
but they'll probably end up belonging
to the suspects we have already.

27:02.926 --> 27:05.428
Guy you want's too smart
to put his hands on a casket?

27:05.428 --> 27:07.639
Especially when it
doubles as an arsenal.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.016
Got your page.

27:10.141 --> 27:13.019
Are you thinking this heist
is related to my task force?

27:13.019 --> 27:14.395
Nedir Kire.

27:14.395 --> 27:15.939
Have you ever heard that name?

27:16.147 --> 27:18.358
No. Sounds Russian.

27:18.358 --> 27:19.818
Well, wherever he's from,

27:19.818 --> 27:21.945
I think he put this
whole thing together.

27:22.487 --> 27:24.739
How about DEA,
ATF's database?

27:24.739 --> 27:25.949
No.

27:25.949 --> 27:27.117
Dead ends.

27:28.118 --> 27:29.202
Well ...

27:29.202 --> 27:30.370
sorry I couldn't help.

27:30.370 --> 27:31.621
I wouldn't say that.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.211
Oh, before I go,

27:39.963 --> 27:41.631
reporters called me last night.

27:42.298 --> 27:45.009
Because of the shooting.
They wanted a comment.

27:45.009 --> 27:46.553
What?
Why?

27:46.636 --> 27:48.179
Well, you know...

27:48.805 --> 27:52.684
my husband killed in
the line of duty, drug rip-off.

27:52.767 --> 27:54.018
And now, two years later,

27:54.018 --> 27:57.564
my brother-in-law at
a drug heist shoot-out.

27:57.564 --> 27:58.690
You're not talking
about reporters,

27:58.690 --> 28:00.024
you're talking about Rayas.

28:01.901 --> 28:04.070
Horatio Caine
mows his lawn,

28:04.070 --> 28:06.573
and Rayas makes it
prime-time news.

28:10.034 --> 28:11.411
I'm glad you're okay.

28:11.828 --> 28:13.079
Always.

28:16.207 --> 28:18.376
Yeah.
Good luck.

28:28.553 --> 28:31.139
Nedir kire.

29:16.684 --> 29:18.728
Hell, this place looks
like a battle zone.

29:18.728 --> 29:20.814
Look at all the stray gunfire.
You know,

29:20.814 --> 29:22.440
I'm not as concerned about
the ones going in  ...

29:22.440 --> 29:23.608
as the one
that came out.

29:24.234 --> 29:25.193
You found that here?

29:25.193 --> 29:28.446
Yeah. I think this gives us
cause to search the place.

29:29.364 --> 29:30.406
Yep.

29:38.540 --> 29:40.291
Do you always
work on Sundays?

29:40.917 --> 29:43.211
Only when I'm expecting
a visit from an angel.

29:44.337 --> 29:46.756
Well, you might think I'm
the devil in just a second.

29:52.262 --> 29:54.389
Did you see anybody
out there shooting?

29:54.514 --> 29:56.850
No. I was hiding
behind the limestone.

29:56.850 --> 29:58.768
It sounded like Liberty City
on Fourth of July.

29:58.768 --> 30:00.770
You own a firearm,
Mr. Tomassi?

30:00.979 --> 30:01.813
No.

30:01.813 --> 30:02.856
No?

30:02.856 --> 30:04.232
You mind if we take
a look around?

30:04.649 --> 30:06.901
It's important to recover
all of the rounds ...

30:06.901 --> 30:08.236
in an officer-involved
shooting.

30:09.988 --> 30:11.156
Sure.
Okay.

30:40.518 --> 30:42.729
What were you doing
at the time of the shooting?

30:42.729 --> 30:45.482
I was working on the limestone.
I don't know anything.

30:46.941 --> 30:48.401
Good, 'cause I'm
done here.

30:52.238 --> 30:54.532
Did you tell me your name
was Calleigh Duquesne?

30:54.616 --> 30:55.658
Yes, I did.

30:56.743 --> 30:58.703
But my nickname
is "lamb chop".

30:58.703 --> 31:00.789
But only my dad
calls me that now.

31:00.789 --> 31:02.123
Oh, I know,
I'm sorry.

31:02.123 --> 31:03.917
Okay, "yes" or "no" only.
Fire away.

31:06.377 --> 31:07.545
Did you consume
any alcohol ...

31:07.545 --> 31:10.757
or drugs in an attempt
to influence this exam?

31:10.757 --> 31:11.841
No.

31:12.050 --> 31:14.636
Did you process drug
evidence for dispo day?

31:14.636 --> 31:15.678
Yes.

31:25.021 --> 31:26.648
Was that drug cocaine?

31:26.940 --> 31:27.982
Yes.

31:37.158 --> 31:38.535
We need a sample.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.578
Well, okay, um ...

31:40.703 --> 31:42.497
but I'm not going to do it
in front of you.

31:43.123 --> 31:44.332
You wanted to see me?

31:44.332 --> 31:45.792
I think we found our mole.

31:45.792 --> 31:48.419
Calleigh Duquesne just tested
positive for cocaine.

31:48.962 --> 31:51.089
Horatio, I don't know
what happened.

31:51.089 --> 31:53.174
I promise you, I have never
done any type of drug.

31:53.174 --> 31:54.217
I know you didn't.

31:54.217 --> 31:55.260
She will appeal.

31:55.552 --> 31:56.302
Appeal.

31:56.302 --> 31:58.179
Until then,
she's relieved of duty.

31:59.222 --> 32:00.432
You're making a mistake.

32:00.432 --> 32:03.226
Your CSI pops positive,
and you don't think she's the mole?

32:03.226 --> 32:04.477
That's correct.

32:05.019 --> 32:06.563
What are you talking about?

32:07.814 --> 32:10.775
You guys couldn't find
your ass with both hands.

32:10.775 --> 32:12.569
Now, you should be
thanking her.

32:13.403 --> 32:14.362
Why?

32:14.362 --> 32:16.823
Because, if it's what I think ...

32:16.823 --> 32:18.491
she just cracked the case.

32:33.004 --> 32:34.089
How you feeling?

32:34.798 --> 32:37.884
Like a hummingbird
on six cups of coffee.

32:38.301 --> 32:39.719
Describe that to me.

32:40.262 --> 32:44.432
Uh, I feel confused,
angry, confused.

32:44.432 --> 32:45.850
I-I know that I have said
this to you before,

32:45.850 --> 32:47.435
but I want to make
sure that you know.

32:47.435 --> 32:48.728
I did not take anything.

32:48.728 --> 32:50.105
Okay, hang on a second.

32:50.105 --> 32:51.481
Are your lips numb?

32:51.481 --> 32:52.482
Yes.

32:52.482 --> 32:53.566
Okay.

32:53.566 --> 32:56.444
Now, what have you been
doing for the last eight hours?

32:56.653 --> 32:58.697
Tripp and I were following
the mystery trajectory.

32:58.697 --> 33:01.324
We-we went
to the tile place.

33:01.324 --> 33:02.617
I ate a granola bar.

33:02.617 --> 33:04.327
Uh, then we went back
to the firearms lab.

33:04.327 --> 33:05.120
Okay.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.746
All right.
Hang on a second.

33:07.372 --> 33:08.623
You went to the tile place.

33:08.623 --> 33:10.625
What did you find
at the tile place?

33:11.167 --> 33:12.836
I found a bullet,
but no casings.

33:12.836 --> 33:15.255
It had gone through the door,
and it had lodged into the tile.

33:15.255 --> 33:16.756
I think it was Italian marble,

33:16.756 --> 33:19.259
and I had a very difficult
time digging it out.

33:23.388 --> 33:25.557
Okay. I think you've
been dosed.

33:29.728 --> 33:31.062
Where's the bullet now?

33:40.697 --> 33:41.740
That's cocaine.

33:48.997 --> 33:51.041
No, let's do another one.

33:54.169 --> 33:56.087
Come on, that's marble from
the Avellino province.

33:56.087 --> 33:58.089
Do you have any idea how
much one of those costs?

33:58.089 --> 34:00.216
About half as much as two.
Go ahead.

34:02.636 --> 34:03.929
Okay, okay, okay.

34:04.554 --> 34:06.181
Paul, why don't you just
tell us where the cocaine is,

34:06.181 --> 34:08.975
because we are happy
to test every tile in here.

34:09.184 --> 34:10.310
So, it's up to you.

34:11.978 --> 34:13.438
Follow me.
All right.

34:28.661 --> 34:30.371
Blue as sky.

34:30.371 --> 34:32.165
Cocaine hydrochloride.

34:34.250 --> 34:37.379
I've seen it pressed into plastic
before, but this is new.

34:53.103 --> 34:55.397
This looks like some
type of adhesive.

34:55.688 --> 34:58.525
Organic.
Maybe like a sap.

34:58.525 --> 34:59.776
Yeah, it's not very strong.

34:59.776 --> 35:01.903
No, but it maintains
its purity.

35:01.903 --> 35:03.196
How do you get it
back to powder?

35:03.196 --> 35:05.198
I don't know.
Let's ask Paul.

35:26.970 --> 35:29.014
Nice way to move
cocaine in plain sight,

35:29.014 --> 35:30.682
unless you're just
laundering the profits.

35:30.682 --> 35:33.602
Either way,
we've got you for murder.

35:34.144 --> 35:36.896
Murder?
It's just coke.

35:36.980 --> 35:39.024
Courtesy of a couple
of dead cops, it's not.

35:39.024 --> 35:40.150
Oh, no, you've got it
wrong, man.

35:40.150 --> 35:41.943
This isn't the stuff
you're looking for.

35:41.943 --> 35:43.945
I got this from Haiti
three weeks ago.

35:43.945 --> 35:45.030
Underside of a cruise ship.

35:45.030 --> 35:46.573
Well, we'll see about
that, won't we?

35:46.573 --> 35:48.116
We're going to take it with us.

35:51.661 --> 35:54.205
I'm going to need to talk to
you later about something.

35:54.205 --> 35:56.291
Okay, you just let me know.

36:02.547 --> 36:03.673
Wait a second.

36:03.673 --> 36:05.425
That's a piece of
evidence tape.

36:06.259 --> 36:07.385
Yeah.

36:09.387 --> 36:11.723
This cocaine did not
come from Haiti.

36:11.723 --> 36:14.184
Not unless Haiti's in the
middle of our crime lab.

36:14.601 --> 36:15.810
That's right.

36:16.519 --> 36:19.189
You're not smart enough to put
this thing together on your own.

36:19.522 --> 36:21.733
Who's your partner?
I don't have one.

36:21.733 --> 36:23.777
My name is the only one
on the company's paper.

36:23.777 --> 36:25.320
That's 'cause
you're stupid.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.696
Now, who's your partner.

36:27.197 --> 36:30.367
Does "Nedir Kire"
ring a bell?

36:31.284 --> 36:32.285
No.

36:32.619 --> 36:33.787
You believe him, Lieutenant?

36:34.204 --> 36:35.246
No.

36:45.966 --> 36:47.008
Any progress?

36:47.425 --> 36:48.468
No.

36:51.596 --> 36:52.639
Eric ...

36:52.639 --> 36:53.598
come here a minute.

36:54.975 --> 36:57.644
Although it's been
confused for Russian,

36:57.644 --> 37:00.605
if you read "Nedir Kire"
backwards,

37:00.605 --> 37:03.858
it spells "Erik Riden."

37:09.281 --> 37:13.034
Erik Riden, you are
about to be searched.

37:17.289 --> 37:19.124
"Newark's Erik Riden
of Whaler College,

37:19.124 --> 37:23.295
Reporting on the New Student
Cafeteria for WXLY."

37:23.295 --> 37:24.337
Erik Riden.

37:24.379 --> 37:25.964
Zoom in on that picture.

37:28.341 --> 37:29.926
Now, does that look
familiar to you?

37:31.303 --> 37:32.554
Enrique Rayas.

37:32.554 --> 37:33.930
Enrique Rayas.
Film at eleven.

37:33.930 --> 37:36.224
He probably changed it
from Erik to Enrique ...

37:36.224 --> 37:37.517
after he moved to Miami.

37:37.517 --> 37:38.893
Where'd he get the Rayas from?

37:38.893 --> 37:40.770
Probably out of the air.
Makes sense.

37:40.770 --> 37:43.148
Appeal to the local
Hispanic audience.

37:44.065 --> 37:45.191
Now how do we prove it?

37:45.191 --> 37:46.067
Wait a minute.

37:46.067 --> 37:47.986
Is this the footage from
the day of the shooting?

37:47.986 --> 37:48.778
It is.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.405
Zoom in on that.

37:52.490 --> 37:54.034
That could be
gunpowder residue.

37:54.034 --> 37:55.327
If it is ...

37:55.619 --> 37:58.663
he just broadcast it all
over the Miami news.

37:58.663 --> 38:00.373
Many people are saying that
they should shut down ...

38:00.373 --> 38:02.208
the incinerator in the
wake of the shooting.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.668
What are your
feelings about that?

38:03.668 --> 38:05.003
Well, as the owner, I mean,

38:05.003 --> 38:06.713
I can understand
people's fear, but ...

38:06.713 --> 38:09.132
What people should be
afraid of is Nedir Kire.

38:09.132 --> 38:11.259
What is he ... ?
Cut, cut!

38:11.885 --> 38:14.012
Oh, excuse me.
What are you talking about?

38:14.012 --> 38:16.389
We will discuss it on the ride.
There's your car.

38:16.389 --> 38:18.475
We have a warrant for the
clothes you wore yesterday.

38:18.767 --> 38:20.852
Mr. Stokes, as owner
of the incinerator,

38:20.852 --> 38:23.730
you knew the date, the time
and the route the truck took.

38:23.730 --> 38:25.315
So, did you tell Enrique?

38:25.315 --> 38:27.651
I don't even tell
my wife that stuff.

38:27.651 --> 38:30.236
I told all of this to your
Detective yesterday.

38:30.236 --> 38:32.948
Bob, I can be
a friend on this.

38:36.076 --> 38:37.744
I might have made a mistake.

38:38.662 --> 38:39.788
Come on.

38:39.996 --> 38:42.040
We know how you found
out about Dispo Day.

38:44.751 --> 38:46.503
Silence.

38:48.171 --> 38:49.631
Enrique --

38:49.631 --> 38:51.091
I mean, Erik--

38:51.424 --> 38:54.219
the incinerator owner
that tipped you off ...

38:54.219 --> 38:56.137
is down at homicide
as we speak,

38:56.137 --> 38:58.890
giving his statement.
So ...

38:59.015 --> 39:00.475
Talk to us, Enrique.

39:00.475 --> 39:01.726
It's your last chance.

39:01.726 --> 39:04.271
We know you were the brains
behind the coke operation.

39:04.396 --> 39:06.356
Your partner, Tomassi,
already gave you up.

39:06.982 --> 39:08.275
You're on your own, anyway.

39:09.859 --> 39:11.403
Do you guys get cell
service in here?

39:11.403 --> 39:12.612
Because I'm-I'm
having a ...

39:15.532 --> 39:19.244
The substance on
your shirt, Enrique --

39:19.244 --> 39:21.246
that blue substance --
that's gunpowder.

39:21.955 --> 39:23.748
Which places you
there as the shooter.

39:27.460 --> 39:31.047
It also means that you not
only organized the hijacking,

39:31.047 --> 39:33.091
you participated in
it on the day.

39:33.091 --> 39:34.593
And I want to know why.

39:34.801 --> 39:37.095
Television station not
paying you enough?

39:37.095 --> 39:39.598
Cocaine tile business
not cutting it?

39:43.268 --> 39:44.853
Did you see the coverage?

39:45.061 --> 39:46.605
That footage aired nationally.

39:48.607 --> 39:50.984
And it came from
a secondary market.

39:52.444 --> 39:54.237
It came from Miami.

39:57.157 --> 40:00.118
For fame, fortune,
and one hell of an alibi?

40:00.827 --> 40:02.704
Ripe piece of tape, Horatio.

40:03.622 --> 40:05.081
And you and I, my friend,

40:06.374 --> 40:07.959
we are going to get
everything we want.

40:10.253 --> 40:12.213
I agree, my friend.

40:12.422 --> 40:13.632
The difference is,

40:13.632 --> 40:18.345
you will be receiving yours
in a 6-by-9 cell.

40:25.769 --> 40:28.271
So, how'd you tie the leak
back to the incinerator owner?

40:28.271 --> 40:29.356
I just talked to him.

40:29.356 --> 40:30.774
Oh, come on!

40:30.774 --> 40:32.025
I find that ...

40:32.025 --> 40:36.196
hooking someone up to a wire
tends to interfere with the process.

40:37.113 --> 40:38.448
But that's just me.

40:40.450 --> 40:41.534
Speed?

40:41.534 --> 40:43.161
You wanted to talk?

40:43.161 --> 40:45.246
I heard you got the guy
behind the shooting.

40:45.455 --> 40:46.456
That's true.

40:49.376 --> 40:50.794
Yeah, uh ...

40:53.838 --> 40:56.174
the thing I wanted
to talk to you about...

40:58.260 --> 40:59.219
My gun...

40:59.219 --> 41:00.512
Speed ...

41:00.512 --> 41:02.847
we were ambushed,
and it happens.

41:02.847 --> 41:04.349
Yeah, but, uh ...

41:04.349 --> 41:05.642
You got to believe me.

41:06.059 --> 41:07.560
These things happen.

41:08.603 --> 41:10.230
You didn't do anything wrong.

41:11.273 --> 41:12.565
You're a good man.

41:15.277 --> 41:16.569
Okay?

41:17.612 --> 41:18.697
Thanks.

41:20.282 --> 41:21.366
What's that?

41:21.366 --> 41:24.411
This is a belated birthday
present for you.

41:25.537 --> 41:27.163
Happy birthday.

41:27.163 --> 41:28.123
Okay?

41:28.123 --> 41:29.582
Now, you hang in there.

41:30.417 --> 41:31.459
Thanks.

41:45.515 --> 41:46.850
No comment.

41:47.142 --> 41:47.976
Come on.

41:47.976 --> 41:49.060
No comment.

41:50.103 --> 41:51.938
Mr. Rayas, Mr. Rayas,
is it true that...?

41:51.938 --> 41:55.066
Over here, Mr. Rayas,
I've got a question...
