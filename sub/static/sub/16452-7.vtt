00:15.460 --> 00:19.770
So, when was your last visit to a gynecologist?

00:19.900 --> 00:22.190
Oh, um...

00:22.960 --> 00:25.270
Mmm, a year ago? Maybe.

00:25.410 --> 00:27.600
I'm not sure. Maybe two.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.710
Mm-hmm.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.860
So, what kind of symptoms are you experiencing?

00:35.020 --> 00:36.670
Um... [sighs]

00:37.560 --> 00:40.130
Well, i've been feverish on and off

00:40.160 --> 00:42.520
for the past month or two.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.630
And, um, my heart starts racing.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.040
My skin tingles a little bit.

00:47.190 --> 00:48.530
It's probably just nerves.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.490
A lot of pressure from my job,

00:50.660 --> 00:52.730
and my boyfriend and i, we're trying to find a house.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.360
And the housing market is ridiculous...

00:55.510 --> 00:56.770
if you don't think it's physical,

00:56.930 --> 01:00.380
why not see a psychiatrist instead of me?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.950
Swallow.

01:09.010 --> 01:12.160
Let's have a look at things, shall we?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.360
A little poke.

01:32.470 --> 01:35.930
I'll run a full chem panel and check your hormone levels.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.160
Now, i've set up a tentative appointment for you next week

01:39.190 --> 01:41.530
in case we have to discuss your results.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.430
So, do you have any questions, brenda?

01:47.730 --> 01:48.880
No, no.

01:49.080 --> 01:53.190
No questions. Thank you. Bye.

02:03.930 --> 02:06.530
Sanchez: This is the younger victim, jesse romero.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.560
He's a catorce.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.870
So is the older kid lying next to him, angel flores.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.560
No blood trail? Nothing.

02:15.690 --> 02:18.350
Pretty much shot where they stand.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.560
Right.

02:34.190 --> 02:35.670
Hey, chief.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.630
Uh, we got two teenage victims,17 and 19.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.960
They're confirmed members of the catorces gang,

02:42.000 --> 02:42.840
the same ones we had the...

02:42.970 --> 02:44.680
i remember the catorces, sergeant.

02:44.810 --> 02:47.260
Excuse us. Please step aside.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.200
[Indistinct shouting] step aside, please.

02:49.410 --> 02:51.270
Let go of me, man!

02:51.420 --> 02:55.430
Uh, neighbor reported shots fired around 4:40.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.530
That's my family in there, man!

02:57.560 --> 02:59.560
Uh, the woman claims that she saw black gang members...

02:59.700 --> 03:03.160
why is priority homicide been called in for a local gang feud?

03:03.190 --> 03:05.100
Commander taylor requested us.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.760
Is everything all right?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.350
Oh, no. I... yes. I'm fine, sergeant.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.100
Thank you. Let's see what's going on here.

03:12.130 --> 03:14.700
Let me go, man! That's my family in there, man!

03:14.730 --> 03:16.960
Would you find out who that boy is, please?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.790
So, commander, how can i help you?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.700
Johnson, as you're probably aware,

03:21.730 --> 03:24.440
there have been 12 racially motivated gang shootings

03:24.570 --> 03:27.360
in this neighborhood over the past three weeks.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.530
This black-on-brown gang war is becoming an epidemic.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.930
Well, i'm not sure i'm the cure for that, commander.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.130
I spoke to chief pope, and he agrees...

03:35.160 --> 03:37.460
we have to start catching these killers...

03:37.500 --> 03:39.930
or this conflict can only get worse.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.030
All right, detective sanchez.

03:42.060 --> 03:43.190
What do we have?

03:43.230 --> 03:44.470
It wasn't a drive-by.

03:44.570 --> 03:47.010
Three casings from a.25-caliber.

03:47.150 --> 03:49.330
It looks like the shooter just walked up and fired.

03:49.460 --> 03:51.900
Did you say walked up?

03:52.810 --> 03:53.990
Ugh.

03:54.490 --> 03:55.930
Why this house, i wonder.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.210
The younger one over there, jesse romero,17,

03:59.350 --> 04:00.670
lived here with his mother.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.600
We pulled a 9-millimeter from underneath his front waistband.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.020
This boy never drew his gun?

04:05.180 --> 04:07.160
Never even touched it.

04:07.530 --> 04:10.080
So, at the very least, taken by surprise.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.580
Taylor: Older boy here, angel flores,

04:12.720 --> 04:16.000
might have been the shooter in last weekend's double homicide.

04:16.149 --> 04:19.380
Couple of one-fives got blasted away in their driveway.

04:19.540 --> 04:20.769
We brought the little angel in,

04:20.920 --> 04:23.190
but we didn't get squat out of him.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.520
One-fives might have decided he was their guy.

04:26.660 --> 04:28.220
I see.

04:28.770 --> 04:32.090
All right. Anyone home?

04:33.620 --> 04:35.910
Flynn: Okay, meet our potential eyewitness...

04:36.060 --> 04:39.070
rosalie romero, mother of the younger victim, jesse.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.600
Right over there by the needles.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.730
Ma'am?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.820
I'm so sorry about your son.

04:52.750 --> 04:56.760
Mrs. Romero, i'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.940
I understand how upsetting this must be for you.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.290
Um, chief?

05:08.440 --> 05:09.910
Black tar heroin.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.410
Found it in the end table over here.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.490
There's enough for a sales case, chief.

05:15.650 --> 05:19.710
Maybe her dead gangster son was selling it to her.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.020
You want me to hold her overnight?

05:22.130 --> 05:24.580
Yes, please, lieutenant. Thank you.

05:24.690 --> 05:25.410
Chief?

05:25.560 --> 05:28.330
That kid you told me to talk to... his name's miguel torres.

05:28.470 --> 05:29.650
He's a cousin of one of the victims.

05:29.820 --> 05:30.670
He lives just down the street,

05:30.850 --> 05:33.280
but he is out front, and he's causing a big scene.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.930
All right, thank you.

05:38.780 --> 05:40.460
Miguel: Kill the one-fives! Buzz.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.950
Kill the one-fives!

05:43.110 --> 05:45.270
Imátelos! Imátelos!

05:45.430 --> 05:46.960
Listen to me, young man. Imátelos!

05:47.110 --> 05:49.660
I need you to calm down. Your family needs you right now.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.470
If you don't calm down, i'm gonna take you downtown

05:51.630 --> 05:54.290
for interfering with a criminal investigation, okay?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.810
Miguel! That's my son! Miguel! Miguel!

05:58.820 --> 05:59.750
What's your name?

05:59.910 --> 06:01.690
My name is carlos torres. That's my son, miguel.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.460
Listen, he's not a gang member.

06:03.610 --> 06:05.150
He's just upset his cousin was shot.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.110
He's also inflaming the crowd.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.320
You're jesse romero's uncle?

06:09.450 --> 06:11.440
Yes, yes, i am.

06:11.590 --> 06:12.720
Itodo va a salir bien, mijo!

06:12.860 --> 06:14.360
Cálmese, miguel, cálmese.

06:14.510 --> 06:16.380
No, it's not okay!

06:16.560 --> 06:19.240
Ijesse nos defendló|y ellos lo mataron!

06:19.370 --> 06:21.230
¿qulén va a defendernos ahora?

06:21.380 --> 06:23.860
¿qulén va a protegernos, pap? I¿t?!

06:24.020 --> 06:25.260
Buzz: "what did i tell you?

06:25.400 --> 06:28.230
"You see what happens to gang members? Do you see?"

06:28.400 --> 06:30.720
"No, dad... you see what happens to latinos?

06:30.850 --> 06:33.400
"The one-fives are killing us. We have to fight back.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.390
You're being a coward."

06:35.920 --> 06:37.390
Pope: We have to find whoever murdered these boys

06:37.550 --> 06:39.800
before the catorces decide to retaliate.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.930
If they haven't already.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.870
Well, miguel here obviously cared a lot

06:44.050 --> 06:45.310
about at least one of the victims.

06:45.470 --> 06:46.700
Let's start with him.

06:46.850 --> 06:49.280
Detective sanchez?

06:53.930 --> 06:57.030
Excuse me. Please, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.460
My son miguel, he was very upset today.

07:00.610 --> 07:03.250
Not because he's a gang member,

07:03.410 --> 07:06.880
but because he and jesse are cousins, that's all.

07:07.050 --> 07:10.170
He has no idea about anything that happened today.

07:10.340 --> 07:14.690
He was home with me, recovering from a knee injury.

07:14.860 --> 07:15.790
Miguel was with me.

07:15.950 --> 07:18.400
He wasn't with you when we were investigating your nephew's murder.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.350
Well, talk to his school. Miguel's never been in trouble.

07:20.510 --> 07:21.780
He's in trouble now, sir.

07:21.910 --> 07:23.600
He interfered with a criminal investigation.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.870
I'm telling you that...

07:26.940 --> 07:28.860
ma'am, i'm telling you,

07:28.990 --> 07:32.410
miguel is not like those gang members.

07:32.660 --> 07:37.070
He already has a baseball scholarship to usc.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.730
I raised a good boy.

07:39.890 --> 07:41.040
Well, as a good boy,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.170
i expect him to cooperate with the police.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.440
Excuse me, sir.

07:48.970 --> 07:51.740
So, miguel, you play baseball.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.040
Yeah. I played baseball all my life.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.460
But not today.

07:56.620 --> 07:58.940
Your father tells me that you hurt your knee?

07:59.060 --> 08:01.410
Yeah, last month.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.580
It'll be fine in a couple weeks.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.370
Well, my brothers played sports, and i know when you're hurt,

08:07.520 --> 08:09.750
watching from the bench is no fun.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.860
Did your cousin jesse play baseball?

08:14.000 --> 08:14.890
Yes.

08:15.030 --> 08:18.370
Up until the time he was cut from the team last year.

08:18.530 --> 08:22.220
And that's when he joined the east-side catorces?

08:23.680 --> 08:26.280
Answer the question.

08:27.890 --> 08:29.240
All right.

08:29.390 --> 08:32.919
Yeah, that's when he joined the catorces.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.280
Someone has to protect our neighborhood, okay?

08:37.440 --> 08:39.549
You guys sure aren't doing it.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.080
Is that why the one-five went after your cousin jesse?

08:43.240 --> 08:45.420
Or were they hunting the other boy, angel?

08:45.560 --> 08:47.830
Hey, they didn't come after angel or jesse...

08:48.030 --> 08:50.120
they came after <i>all</i> of us, man!

08:50.290 --> 08:52.280
If they hadn't found one of them, it could have been me!

08:52.430 --> 08:56.770
Look, miguel, we're just trying to find out if the one-fives

08:56.920 --> 08:59.240
had a specific reason for killing either jesse or...

08:59.380 --> 09:02.500
if you're looking for a specific reason, lady,

09:02.660 --> 09:04.630
then you don't know my world, do you?

09:04.790 --> 09:07.400
This is the reason, right here!

09:07.540 --> 09:09.910
The color of our skin!

09:10.030 --> 09:12.030
Tell her, man! You know!

09:12.180 --> 09:14.700
So, the one-fives are going after anyone brown,

09:14.850 --> 09:15.830
or just the catorces?

09:15.990 --> 09:20.100
They're targeting the people who protect the rest of us.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.120
Well, i'm one of those people, miguel,

09:23.290 --> 09:25.270
and so is detective sanchez.

09:25.470 --> 09:26.470
So, if you help us,

09:26.700 --> 09:30.490
we can use what you know about jesse and angel

09:30.640 --> 09:32.840
to find the person who killed them.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.200
Not if i find him first.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.110
I'm not even sure this guy's in a gang,

09:42.300 --> 09:44.970
and look how angry he is.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.630
The last time these two gangs clashed,

09:47.750 --> 09:50.340
six bodies wound up in the morgue.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.790
We need a truce meeting tomorrow.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.720
Leaders of the catorces and the one-fives...

09:54.800 --> 09:57.910
??????

10:20.620 --> 10:24.410
So, detective sanchez.

10:24.570 --> 10:29.450
I need you to supervise round-the-clock surveillance

10:29.600 --> 10:31.980
for our new friend miguel.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.880
Are we set up for that in his neighborhood?

10:36.040 --> 10:37.950
Well, it's my 'hood, too, chief.

10:38.100 --> 10:38.880
Right.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.050
Anyway, yes.

10:41.210 --> 10:44.750
Gang intelligence set up cameras above the streets in catorce

10:44.900 --> 10:46.270
and one-five territories.

10:46.410 --> 10:47.800
The coverage is pretty good.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.430
I can use the van, track him camera to camera

10:51.590 --> 10:53.160
and put a few extra surveillance guys out there

10:53.300 --> 10:54.950
where they'll be useful.

10:55.470 --> 11:00.870
What is it that you think miguel knows that we don't know?

11:01.190 --> 11:02.590
His cousin.

11:02.720 --> 11:08.720
And if miguel won't help us directly,

11:08.870 --> 11:14.710
then maybe he can help us find jesse's killer instead.

11:15.650 --> 11:17.400
Chief? Yes.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.950
Are you feeling all right?

11:20.090 --> 11:24.840
Yes, i just need to go home and lie down for a few minutes.

11:27.170 --> 11:28.790
Chief?

11:28.930 --> 11:30.530
Yes?

11:30.690 --> 11:34.300
Um, get better, please.

11:34.480 --> 11:38.150
You have a good night, too, detective.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.130
I knew it!

11:53.460 --> 11:54.060
What?

11:54.190 --> 11:56.270
I typed in all the symptoms that i've been experiencing

11:56.410 --> 11:58.160
on this medical-expert site,

11:58.300 --> 12:00.310
and it's exactly what i thought... stress.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.440
Which explains why i was such a mess yesterday

12:02.590 --> 12:03.810
and i'm feeling so fine today.

12:03.950 --> 12:06.250
Okay. Let me try this.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.610
Since i'm actually sick.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.480
I made you some soup. Weren't you hungry?

12:10.630 --> 12:13.540
No. You forgot to add water when you stuck it in the microwave.

12:13.720 --> 12:20.820
It's actually more like steaming chicken paste.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.820
Ooh, kitty. [meows]

12:24.940 --> 12:26.870
I'm sorry. Do you want me to make you some more?

12:27.020 --> 12:29.450
No, please. Wait.

12:29.590 --> 12:30.880
Okay.

12:31.210 --> 12:37.180
I have fever, chills, body ache...

12:37.520 --> 12:39.940
no appetite.

12:40.340 --> 12:45.210
So i could have lymphoma, anthrax...

12:45.360 --> 12:46.630
anthrax?

12:46.790 --> 12:48.960
Lyme disease, viral hepatitis...

12:49.880 --> 12:52.260
[laughs]... and stress.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.330
But we both know i actually have the flu.

12:55.660 --> 12:56.770
Your point being?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.400
You can make your symptoms look like anything you want.

12:59.550 --> 13:02.500
What did your doctor say?

13:03.690 --> 13:05.790
About?

13:06.100 --> 13:08.980
How you are feeling. Nothing, really.

13:09.590 --> 13:11.130
Did you ask her <i>anything?</i>

13:11.300 --> 13:13.750
No, i figured if she noticed something, she would just...

13:13.910 --> 13:16.770
brenda leigh johnson had no questions.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.780
Look, dr. Dioli took some blood.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.890
She said she would call me with the results.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.420
I made an appointment for next week if i need it,

13:26.630 --> 13:27.740
and she didn't seem at all concerned,

13:27.890 --> 13:29.290
which indicates to me, stress.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.220
It's stress. That's it.

13:30.270 --> 13:32.480
Because you want it to be stress doesn't mean it is stress.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.210
The doctor has to look at your actual symptoms,

13:35.370 --> 13:36.200
at the bloodwork,

13:36.340 --> 13:40.620
and make a diagnosis based on the facts as they are.

13:40.780 --> 13:43.830
Does that sound familiar?

14:28.230 --> 14:30.760
So, they were shot at jesse romero's house,

14:30.800 --> 14:33.700
so why do we think that the other boy, angel flores,

14:33.730 --> 14:34.450
might have been the target?

14:34.620 --> 14:36.240
The biggest contributing factor

14:36.410 --> 14:38.620
to last year's california prison riots...

14:38.790 --> 14:41.690
a race war between black and latino gangs.

14:41.850 --> 14:45.370
Now thousands of these scum bags are being released every month

14:45.530 --> 14:46.530
and they're bringing their race war

14:46.680 --> 14:48.140
back into the streets with them.

14:48.280 --> 14:52.100
And angel was one of them? Let out of juvie 10 months ago.

14:52.250 --> 14:52.810
Okay.

14:52.970 --> 14:55.310
Lieutenant tao, do we have a timeline on our victims?

14:55.480 --> 14:57.590
More like a phone line, chief.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.790
The last call on jesse's cell came at 4:14 p.m.,

15:00.950 --> 15:02.510
from his mother.

15:02.820 --> 15:05.810
Right after that, jesse rings up angel flores.

15:05.990 --> 15:09.380
23 minutes later, a neighbor dials 911.

15:09.550 --> 15:11.780
I wonder why jesse's mother was calling him.

15:11.930 --> 15:13.770
She might have been asking her son to come home.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.740
No, she didn't seem like she was up for visitors.

15:16.890 --> 15:17.780
Speaking of which,

15:17.950 --> 15:19.640
is mrs. Romero ready in interview room 1?

15:19.790 --> 15:22.170
Not quite. She'll need another hour.

15:22.310 --> 15:23.810
[Chuckles] at least.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.870
All right. Well, what about the weapons?

15:26.030 --> 15:27.910
Both vics were shot by a.25-caliber.

15:28.070 --> 15:29.340
Small by gangster standards.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.790
Jesse and angel's 9 millimeters

15:30.940 --> 15:32.150
would have been a lot more efficient.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.530
Had they been able to get to them.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.010
So, the killer was either lying in wait, or...

15:36.150 --> 15:37.150
or they were set up.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.190
I guess, what, the killer ran away?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.790
Did the 911 caller report anyone running away?

15:42.940 --> 15:45.000
Just spoke to her. Ida martinez.

15:45.170 --> 15:48.700
Confirms seeing some black gang members in a gray truck.

15:48.870 --> 15:50.290
Wait a minute, there was a vehicle involved?

15:50.440 --> 15:52.830
She saw the truck two days ago.

15:52.990 --> 15:54.900
It drives up and down her street occasionally,

15:55.060 --> 15:58.190
you know, with black gangsters, guns hanging out the windows.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.700
So when she heard the gunshots, she just assumed it was them.

16:00.870 --> 16:02.580
But she never actually saw them.

16:02.740 --> 16:05.230
Well, not yesterday. Sorry, chief.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.600
Anything else no one saw?

16:08.340 --> 16:10.750
The loch ness monster, maybe?

16:10.940 --> 16:13.420
Jimmy hoffa? The invisible man?

16:13.570 --> 16:14.800
For heaven's sakes!

16:14.960 --> 16:16.550
Y'all ought to know that this is the kind of information

16:16.750 --> 16:18.380
i ought to be given immediately!

16:18.540 --> 16:21.180
I mean, what are we doing here?!

16:30.150 --> 16:33.930
There are no witnesses at all? Is that what we're saying?

16:34.490 --> 16:37.900
What are we basing our theory of this case on, then?

16:44.710 --> 16:46.090
Excuse me.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.780
Yes, detective sanchez.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.560
Chief, baseball practice is starting,

16:49.710 --> 16:51.980
but i don't think miguel torres is going.

16:52.130 --> 16:54.410
I've got surveillance officers on him

16:54.560 --> 16:57.520
and he's walking off with two catorces veteranos right now.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.050
Should i pick him up?

16:59.220 --> 17:00.030
For what?

17:00.200 --> 17:03.250
Chief, these guys that miguel's with, they're bad news.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.730
I mean, if he is not in a gang right now,

17:04.890 --> 17:06.599
he is going to be by tonight.

17:06.750 --> 17:10.109
He also may be doing what he needs to do to find the killer.

17:10.310 --> 17:13.940
Just????

17:34.020 --> 17:35.900
Probation officers brought in a couple of leaders

17:36.060 --> 17:38.490
from both the catorces and the one-fives, but so far,

17:38.650 --> 17:40.960
they're just sitting across from each other, not saying a word.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.040
I don't know if your going in there

17:42.190 --> 17:43.550
is gonna help things or hurt.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.730
Well, i just have a theory i'd like to clear up.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.200
Just a few simple questions.

17:47.420 --> 17:49.040
Which they probably won't answer.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.900
Not to make too big a deal about this,

17:51.080 --> 17:52.120
but these gang members

17:52.260 --> 17:54.360
generally don't respond really well to women.

17:54.550 --> 17:57.660
They don't respond well to white men or police officers, either.

17:57.850 --> 17:59.050
And anyway, if they're not talking,

17:59.210 --> 18:01.680
how much worse can i make it?

18:03.300 --> 18:06.420
Hey. You want to be my bitch?

18:07.820 --> 18:09.140
I'm so sorry.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.700
My dance card is full.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.300
I just have a few quick questions

18:14.450 --> 18:19.050
regarding the shooting yesterday of two catorce gang members.

18:19.210 --> 18:21.790
A jesse romero and angel flores.

18:21.940 --> 18:22.910
As hard as it is to believe,

18:23.050 --> 18:26.390
someone walked up to those two young boys in broad daylight

18:26.540 --> 18:28.390
in the middle of catorce turf,

18:28.540 --> 18:30.020
murdered them in cold blood,

18:30.190 --> 18:33.020
and then got away without anyone seeing a thing.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.290
Not a drive-by, which is what y'all are so famous for.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.710
No, the shooter was on foot.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.040
You know, i can't help but wonder

18:43.210 --> 18:45.280
how the killer just magically appeared

18:45.450 --> 18:46.950
at the side door of jesse's house

18:47.130 --> 18:50.380
at the exact minute that angel and jesse were to arrive,

18:50.550 --> 18:52.100
shot and killed both boys,

18:52.290 --> 18:54.490
and then disappeared into thin air

18:54.620 --> 18:58.180
before the victims had a chance to even touch their weapons.

18:58.330 --> 19:02.890
Ak-47s don't give you time to draw no gun, ma. That's right.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.610
What is she talking about?

19:05.750 --> 19:08.200
Right, well, you don't sound very knowledgeable.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.420
Actually, circumstances lead me to believe

19:10.590 --> 19:12.910
that the catorces might have been trying to settle

19:13.070 --> 19:14.970
some sort of internal dispute

19:15.130 --> 19:17.190
and are just letting the one-fives take credit

19:17.370 --> 19:18.380
for jesse and angel's death.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.210
Is that possible?

19:20.380 --> 19:22.150
We didn't kill no angel or jesse.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.250
It was these two fools right here.

19:27.830 --> 19:30.390
I'm sorry, i didn't get your name.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.040
Spider.

19:32.190 --> 19:34.340
Well, i got news for you, spider.

19:34.510 --> 19:36.490
If you boys didn't kill angel and jesse

19:36.650 --> 19:38.810
and the one-fives here figured out some way

19:38.970 --> 19:41.610
to stroll down your streets and knock off anyone they want

19:41.770 --> 19:43.620
and then disappear into thin air,

19:43.780 --> 19:46.040
well, you're probably better off

19:46.240 --> 19:47.790
just shooting yourselves in the head right now

19:47.930 --> 19:49.540
and getting it over with.

19:50.730 --> 19:54.060
Makes me wonder who's the bitch now?

19:54.210 --> 19:55.020
Vieja.

19:55.550 --> 19:56.240
Boom!

20:02.500 --> 20:04.930
Bring it! Bring it! Bring it!

20:11.800 --> 20:13.530
Pope: "who's the bitch now

20:13.560 --> 20:15.730
well, we wanted them talking, will. Now they are.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.100
And i'm one step closer to proving

20:17.230 --> 20:19.190
that this is <i>not</i> a rival gang shooting.

20:19.230 --> 20:21.340
Yeah, and l.a. Is one step closer to civil war.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.460
If we can find out who killed angel and jesse,

20:23.500 --> 20:25.930
then we can prove to these boys that we want to protect them.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.140
They're not interested in proof.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.310
They are only interested in retaliation.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.220
I am trying to calm them down.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.600
Does what i want matter?

20:32.630 --> 20:34.030
Listen to me, will.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.860
You know, i'm struggling real hard

20:36.460 --> 20:38.450
to see how this murder relates to race riots

20:38.610 --> 20:40.730
and black-on-brown killings, and so far, nothing about it

20:40.890 --> 20:42.850
connects to what we know about gang shootings,

20:42.990 --> 20:44.460
not the weapon, not the method,

20:44.610 --> 20:45.900
not even the scene of the crime.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.860
Are you telling me i'm not allowed to investigate

20:48.080 --> 20:50.290
these boys' death unless it fits into your preconceived notion?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.970
That's not what i'm saying, brenda.

20:52.130 --> 20:53.730
Of course i want you to find the murderer.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.040
But is it possible for you to collar one killer

20:56.200 --> 20:57.800
without destroying the entire city in the process?

20:57.970 --> 20:59.170
Well, i don't think the city's the issue here,

20:59.350 --> 21:02.080
and i think it would do everyone some good to rethink that.

21:02.260 --> 21:05.000
[Cellphone rings] including the catorces and the one-fives.

21:05.790 --> 21:07.110
Excuse me. This is about surveillance.

21:07.280 --> 21:08.360
I need to take it.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.160
Go.

21:14.790 --> 21:16.290
Yes, detective sanchez?

21:16.450 --> 21:17.070
What is it?

21:17.230 --> 21:19.010
Sanchez: Chief, there's a group of catorce members

21:19.150 --> 21:21.310
messing with miguel torres in an alley over here.

21:21.470 --> 21:23.540
It's a gang initiation.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.640
Chief, do you want me to stop this? No, no.

21:27.790 --> 21:30.160
If we interfere, miguel will know we're watching him,

21:30.310 --> 21:32.060
and he might not lead us anywhere.

21:32.210 --> 21:33.100
Listen, i know it's hard.

21:33.270 --> 21:35.020
Chief, if you let this happen,

21:35.170 --> 21:37.460
his life expectancy is cut in half.

21:37.610 --> 21:38.890
He may think he needs to go this route

21:39.060 --> 21:40.820
to find his cousin's killer.

21:40.980 --> 21:43.060
Listen, detective sanchez, we don't have a choice here.

21:43.190 --> 21:44.830
If miguel wants to become a catorce,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.440
we're gonna have to let him.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.990
Chief, are you sure about this?

21:47.920 --> 21:51.420
Yes????

22:26.460 --> 22:29.070
So, mrs. Romero.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.460
Does this thing even work?

22:51.610 --> 22:54.240
She really does know the thermostat's only a camera?

22:54.400 --> 22:55.720
Look, she's sweating.

22:55.890 --> 22:57.610
It's like an oven in here.

22:57.750 --> 22:58.560
Buzz, would you call maintenance?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.390
See if they can get the air up in there, huh?

23:01.670 --> 23:03.560
There's something wrong with her, i'm telling you.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.290
Something.

23:06.350 --> 23:11.550
So, who here is going to ask her about it?

23:21.880 --> 23:23.170
So, mrs. Romero,

23:23.310 --> 23:25.090
you can't remember seeing anyone in your house

23:25.260 --> 23:28.670
yesterday afternoon before jesse and angel were killed,

23:28.820 --> 23:30.200
is that right?

23:30.360 --> 23:31.990
Well, i saw shadows or something,

23:32.150 --> 23:34.870
but i wasn't afraid or anything.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.150
Could one of those shadows have been your son?

23:38.290 --> 23:39.280
No.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.920
The last time i saw jesse was in the morning.

23:45.170 --> 23:48.140
Him and his cousin were in the kitchen, arguing.

23:48.380 --> 23:49.700
Again.

23:50.810 --> 23:52.990
What were they arguing about?

23:53.140 --> 23:55.990
Whether miguel could join the catorces.

23:58.050 --> 24:00.830
Miguel always wanted to do what jesse did.

24:00.990 --> 24:03.940
Their whole lives, they were more like brothers.

24:04.110 --> 24:08.110
We was always in and out of each other's houses, you know?

24:10.170 --> 24:13.110
Then my husband died, and...

24:14.680 --> 24:17.030
jesse...

24:17.460 --> 24:20.530
he wanted miguel to go on playing baseball.

24:20.690 --> 24:24.270
So jesse was activelytrying to keep miguel <i>out</i> of the catorces?

24:24.420 --> 24:28.290
Yes. Yes.

24:28.450 --> 24:31.340
He wished he hadn't joined, himself, but...

24:32.400 --> 24:34.910
okay, so you saw jesse and miguel in the morning

24:35.040 --> 24:36.640
when they argued, but not after?

24:36.800 --> 24:38.120
That's right.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.070
Yesterday morning.

24:41.390 --> 24:44.660
That's the last time i ever, ever saw my little boy.

24:44.830 --> 24:47.990
And did you call jesse after that?

24:48.300 --> 24:49.830
No.

24:50.260 --> 24:51.130
Why would i?

24:51.290 --> 24:53.670
Well, i have no idea.

24:55.340 --> 24:58.290
But we checked jesse's cellphone records,

24:58.440 --> 25:02.840
and the last call that he received was from your house.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.360
I don't remember.

25:08.790 --> 25:12.260
I didn't want jesse to be a gang member, i didn't!

25:12.410 --> 25:13.430
I cared for my son!

25:13.640 --> 25:15.030
But when jesse joined the catorces,

25:15.210 --> 25:17.810
you thought you'd, what, make the best out of a bad situation,

25:17.970 --> 25:20.280
is that right? Yes.

25:20.830 --> 25:22.900
What do you mean?

25:24.060 --> 25:27.690
I bet jesse got you a real good discount on your heroin.

25:28.830 --> 25:32.070
That's what the catorces do, isn't it, deal drugs?

25:32.220 --> 25:33.290
I don't know.

25:33.450 --> 25:34.870
Jesse didn't sell me drugs.

25:35.050 --> 25:38.100
Well, these look like fresh bags to me.

25:38.260 --> 25:38.970
Were you using it? No.

25:39.130 --> 25:41.450
Did jesse let you dip into his product? No!

25:41.620 --> 25:43.930
Oh, well, maybe i'm wrong. Maybe you weren't just using it.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.460
Maybe <i>you</i> were dealing, too.

25:47.610 --> 25:49.390
There was an awful lot of heroin at your house,

25:49.530 --> 25:50.380
and if you're not gonna help me,

25:50.540 --> 25:52.440
i think i should tell you, rosalie,

25:52.610 --> 25:55.190
that there's a big difference between buying and selling.

25:55.340 --> 25:56.700
It is measured in years.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.750
No, that's not how it happened!

25:58.930 --> 26:00.840
Jesse hated me doing drugs!

26:01.000 --> 26:03.440
Those weren't my drugs! Those were my dealer's drugs!

26:03.590 --> 26:05.330
He came by yesterday, too!

26:05.490 --> 26:07.630
Your dealer was at your house yesterday,

26:07.790 --> 26:09.110
is that right, rosalie?

26:09.270 --> 26:11.740
Rosalie, if your drug dealer came by your house yesterday,

26:11.890 --> 26:13.960
then you weren't home alone.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.370
Maybe your drug dealer called jesse from your house.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.030
Did your dealer have an argument with jesse?

26:18.200 --> 26:20.640
Is that what happened, rosalie?

26:22.650 --> 26:25.840
I can't tell you where the drugs come from.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.630
Rosalie, just give us a name.

26:28.810 --> 26:32.160
There's no point in giving you his name!

26:32.310 --> 26:34.240
And they'd kill me if i told you.

26:34.390 --> 26:35.860
By "they," you mean the catorces?

26:36.020 --> 26:37.390
Yes, yes!

26:37.540 --> 26:40.820
Now just leave me alone! Stop it, please!

26:40.990 --> 26:43.790
I can't tell you!

26:45.210 --> 26:46.580
Okay.

26:47.310 --> 26:49.730
Okay, rosalie.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.270
Okay.

26:52.430 --> 26:54.840
Look, i know you're scared.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.840
But you told me yourself how much you care about your son.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.110
And right now, you need to think about him,

27:00.240 --> 27:01.310
because your drug dealer

27:01.480 --> 27:03.300
was one of the shadows in your house yesterday,

27:03.450 --> 27:06.130
and i need to talk to him.

27:07.530 --> 27:11.340
My drug dealer can't tell you anything.

27:11.810 --> 27:15.190
There's no use in giving you his name.

27:16.060 --> 27:18.600
No use at all.

27:46.810 --> 27:48.330
Imijo!

27:52.380 --> 27:55.680
Spider, i told you, leave him alone!

27:55.850 --> 27:56.640
Tranquilo, viejo.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.700
He made a choice, old man. What you gonna do, huh?

27:58.840 --> 27:59.870
Oh, yeah? Yeah!

28:00.000 --> 28:01.820
Listen, you son of a bitch!

28:01.980 --> 28:03.880
You guys are nothing but a bunch of punks!

28:04.030 --> 28:05.900
You know that?! Criminals!

28:06.330 --> 28:09.090
Let's go home!

28:09.130 --> 28:11.140
Let's go!

28:17.650 --> 28:20.840
You hand me the gun, and we're going home.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.640
Hand me the gun!

28:22.790 --> 28:24.500
Sanchez: Don't shoot! Hold your fire!

28:24.650 --> 28:26.980
Miguel, listen to me! Put the gun down!

28:27.130 --> 28:28.720
Put the gun down!

28:28.870 --> 28:31.950
Miguel, is that a.25-caliber, miguel?

28:32.110 --> 28:33.770
Put it down.

28:34.310 --> 28:36.070
Miguel, you got two choices!

28:36.230 --> 28:39.250
You put it down now or i'll blow your head off!

28:39.400 --> 28:41.730
Do what he says, mijo, please!

28:42.700 --> 28:43.620
Put it down.

28:43.770 --> 28:46.090
Por favor, do it!

28:50.860 --> 28:52.780
Turn around.

28:57.290 --> 29:00.520
Wait. Hey, officer.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.420
Please, i'm begging you, please.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.210
Don't arrest him. He's my son.

29:04.380 --> 29:08.770
Sir, he's not your son anymore.

29:09.190 --> 29:11.900
He's a catorce.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.190
Okay, thank you. That was ballistics brian.

29:59.350 --> 30:00.810
The.25-caliber we got off miguel torres

30:00.960 --> 30:02.180
is a match for the murder weapon.

30:02.340 --> 30:04.950
And who's the gun registered to? We're still tracking that down.

30:05.110 --> 30:06.860
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

30:07.010 --> 30:07.870
Well, stay on them, lieutenant.

30:08.030 --> 30:11.190
I'm gonna need that registration to make my case.

30:13.060 --> 30:14.400
Chief?

30:14.720 --> 30:16.270
Yes.

30:18.740 --> 30:20.810
Are you okay?

30:21.580 --> 30:24.770
You just don't seem like yourself lately.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.680
I'm fine, lieutenant.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.860
I just...

30:29.340 --> 30:32.740
i just need you to find who the gun is registered to, please.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.900
Thank you.

30:40.350 --> 30:42.710
My son needs to talk to me. I understand that, sir, but what you're gonna need...

30:42.870 --> 30:45.650
chief, excuse me. This whole thing is my fault.

30:45.830 --> 30:48.040
I should have kept miguel at home today.

30:48.190 --> 30:49.290
Listen, chief johnson,

30:49.460 --> 30:51.290
i promise you i will settle him down.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.430
Sir, your son pulled out a gun

30:53.600 --> 30:54.620
and all but threatened you with it.

30:54.780 --> 30:56.960
He's obviously not responding well to parental authority.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.180
Releasing him right now is out of the question.

30:59.210 --> 31:00.010
Come on, sir.

31:01.090 --> 31:02.380
I just want to be very clear

31:02.550 --> 31:05.490
that if you accuse this miguel torres

31:05.670 --> 31:07.210
with a double homicide against the catorces

31:07.360 --> 31:09.060
and the charges don't stick,

31:09.230 --> 31:11.220
the gangs are gonna think that we're siding with the one-fives.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.640
Could turn lapd officers into targets, too.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.450
So, no pressure, commander, is that what you're saying?

31:17.630 --> 31:20.380
Thought you just might want to know the stakes, chief.

31:20.550 --> 31:22.100
I am questioning a boy

31:22.280 --> 31:25.130
who was found holding the murder weapon from a double homicide.

31:25.290 --> 31:28.530
To me, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

31:28.670 --> 31:30.740
If you have a better plan, commander,

31:30.890 --> 31:33.630
now is the time to suggest it.

31:36.210 --> 31:38.170
Excuse me.

31:51.950 --> 31:54.320
So, i hear congratulations are in order

31:54.480 --> 31:57.220
for the newest member of the catorces.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.210
Your father, however, isn't too happy about it.

32:01.370 --> 32:04.490
My father refuses to admit what's going on.

32:05.020 --> 32:07.690
He ignores what he doesn't want to believe.

32:07.840 --> 32:11.610
He pretends that gangs are the problem because he's a coward,

32:11.770 --> 32:14.010
and he won't face the truth.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.020
He's not proud of me? Good.

32:17.170 --> 32:19.840
I'm not very proud of him, either.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.140
What about your cousin jesse?

32:23.490 --> 32:25.340
Would he have been proud?

32:25.490 --> 32:26.710
I know you argued with jesse

32:26.800 --> 32:28.240
in the morning before he was murdered.

32:28.390 --> 32:32.380
'Cause he lied to me. About what?

32:34.840 --> 32:38.670
Jesse told me the catorces said i was too old to join.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.490
But that wasn't true.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.530
I spoke to another gang member who was around a lot,

32:43.650 --> 32:45.490
and he said the catorces <i>did</i> want me.

32:45.650 --> 32:49.440
Which member, and when did you ask him?

32:50.840 --> 32:53.300
Was it your aunt's drug dealer?

32:54.170 --> 32:56.460
He was over at rosalie's house yesterday.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.490
Is he the one that told you that jesse was lying?

33:00.030 --> 33:02.160
Did you call jesse from his house?

33:02.340 --> 33:03.880
Did you wait for him by the side door?

33:04.030 --> 33:06.220
Did you kill jesse because he was lying to you?

33:06.390 --> 33:07.880
Or was it your aunt's drug dealer?!

33:08.050 --> 33:11.390
My aunt's drug dealer's name is angel flores, okay?!

33:11.560 --> 33:14.620
And he's lying next to my cousin in your morgue!

33:14.810 --> 33:16.720
I told you, lady, you do <i>not</i> know my world!

33:16.860 --> 33:18.340
Listen to me!

33:18.510 --> 33:20.400
Angel was killed by the one-fives!

33:20.570 --> 33:23.100
Jesse was killed by the one-fives!

33:23.240 --> 33:24.950
I don't think so.

33:25.110 --> 33:26.820
Because while i don't know your world,

33:26.950 --> 33:28.900
i doknow something about weapons and casings.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.960
So tell me, miguel...

33:31.310 --> 33:36.040
how could the one-fives have shot those boys with <i>your</i> gun?

33:46.400 --> 33:48.740
Maybe she's got him after all.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.940
She still has to get him to say "i do."

33:52.780 --> 33:56.270
Your father said that you were home with him

33:56.420 --> 33:58.740
when jesse was killed.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.170
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

34:02.820 --> 34:05.610
He was just giving you an alibi.

34:11.830 --> 34:14.350
I want a lawyer, man.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.719
I want a lawyer.

34:28.179 --> 34:29.630
I can hold him on a weapons charge.

34:29.770 --> 34:31.179
Till he makes bail.

34:31.350 --> 34:32.270
Unless you can convince the father

34:32.449 --> 34:34.480
to leave him here with us.

34:34.620 --> 34:35.639
Per your request.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.389
Thank you, lieutenant.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.159
Lieutenant. Just one second.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.920
I think i know exactly how to prevent mr. Torres

34:45.090 --> 34:46.880
from bailing him out.

34:47.020 --> 34:49.130
Excuse me, gentlemen.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.620
Brenda: Mr. Torres.

34:54.810 --> 34:57.180
Chief, you can't do this.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.170
Putting miguel in jail...

34:59.330 --> 35:01.830
it's gonna put his scholarship at risk.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.140
A weapons charge? I mean...

35:03.300 --> 35:05.950
sir, it's not just a weapons charge.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.280
Miguel was holding the gun

35:07.430 --> 35:10.530
that killed your nephew and angel flores.

35:12.730 --> 35:13.990
Oh, god.

35:14.130 --> 35:17.810
Mr. Torres, no one is blaming you for this.

35:18.030 --> 35:20.950
We know you did the best you could to supervise your son.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.220
And his baseball scholarship to usc,

35:23.370 --> 35:27.620
i know he owes that in part to the way that you cared for him.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.290
In our neighborhood,

35:30.440 --> 35:33.580
parents have to look after their kids every minute,

35:33.750 --> 35:35.970
especially from 4:00 to 8:00.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.880
That's why after-school sports programs are so important.

35:40.090 --> 35:41.290
I...

35:43.070 --> 35:46.840
i tried to get my nephew jesse to practice harder,

35:47.010 --> 35:49.780
'cause i knew if he got cut from the team,

35:49.950 --> 35:51.840
he could be lost.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.390
And my sister rosalie, she didn't know how to care for him.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.970
'Cause she took drugs every afternoon?

36:01.120 --> 36:03.850
After 2:00 or 3:00 p.m., she was useless.

36:04.020 --> 36:05.200
I tried to fill in where i could,

36:05.370 --> 36:07.990
but children need full-time supervision...

36:08.130 --> 36:10.040
which my son had.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.450
He was with me during the time of the murders.

36:12.630 --> 36:13.960
Really?

36:14.120 --> 36:17.040
Well, if that's true, why didn't miguel say so?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.130
If you're his alibi.

36:19.300 --> 36:22.480
Unless, of course, miguel didn't know where you were

36:22.660 --> 36:25.410
on the day of the murder from 4:00 to 8:00.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.470
Rosalie told me that jesse and miguel

36:27.640 --> 36:30.500
were always in and out of each other's houses.

36:30.610 --> 36:32.500
If i conduct a search warrant of your home,

36:32.640 --> 36:34.560
will i find that you have keys to your sister's house,

36:34.700 --> 36:36.660
or are they on your person?

36:37.950 --> 36:43.150
Someone called jesse from his mother's house at 4:14 p.m.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.770
But it couldn't have been his mother, because, as you said,

36:46.910 --> 36:48.870
she's useless after 2:00.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.280
Probably didn't even notice her visitors.

36:51.430 --> 36:53.840
But you weren't concerned about rosalie.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.460
You were more concerned about your nephew

36:56.620 --> 36:58.650
and the example he set for your son

36:58.700 --> 37:02.370
????

37:22.690 --> 37:25.820
I was the one that took jesse to baseball practice!

37:25.960 --> 37:27.480
I'm the one that paid for his summer camp.

37:27.630 --> 37:29.480
I'm the one that stood by him

37:29.620 --> 37:32.900
and helped him with his homework, and what does he do?

37:33.610 --> 37:34.930
He goes and joins a gang.

37:35.090 --> 37:38.500
And he does everything he can to take my son along with him!

37:38.660 --> 37:39.640
He betrayed me!

37:39.810 --> 37:41.220
No, jesse didn't betray you.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.960
He was <i>preventing</i> miguel from becoming an east-side catorces.

37:45.840 --> 37:47.570
No. What... what are you talking about?

37:47.730 --> 37:48.910
Jesse did everything he could

37:49.070 --> 37:51.220
to keep miguel from joining the catorces.

37:51.390 --> 37:52.450
But you couldn't accept the fact

37:52.620 --> 37:54.570
that your son <i>wanted</i> to be in a gang.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.970
Easier to think that it was a problem created by your nephew,

37:57.120 --> 38:00.640
a problem that you could fix with this gun,

38:01.810 --> 38:03.900
registered to your deceased brother-in-law,

38:04.070 --> 38:07.460
a gun rosalie probably didn't even remember she had.

38:07.630 --> 38:12.030
Now, besides your sister,

38:12.200 --> 38:13.860
there are only two surviving people

38:14.030 --> 38:17.510
who had access to her house, and so, to this gun.

38:17.830 --> 38:21.070
One of them was your son, miguel.

38:21.190 --> 38:25.840
And the other one, sir, would be you.

38:36.590 --> 38:38.530
You have the right to remain silent.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.450
Anything you say can and will be used against you

38:40.590 --> 38:41.500
in a court of law.

38:41.660 --> 38:43.250
You have the right to an attorney.

38:43.410 --> 38:44.700
If you cannot afford an attorney,

38:44.880 --> 38:46.950
an attorney will be appointed to you... i understand, i understand!

38:47.120 --> 38:49.170
I don't want an attorney.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.880
Just, please...

38:52.250 --> 38:55.540
just... let me explain.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.270
Did you go to your sister's house

38:58.430 --> 39:02.800
and call your nephew jesse and ask him to come over?

39:06.130 --> 39:08.290
I need to make an arrest here, sir,

39:08.830 --> 39:11.310
and i need you to tell me who it's gonna be...

39:11.470 --> 39:14.680
you or your son.

39:16.110 --> 39:18.430
Yesterday...

39:19.680 --> 39:22.230
miguel skipped practice.

39:23.310 --> 39:25.860
I waited, but he didn't come home.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.790
I was worried.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.130
So i went to go look to see if maybe he was with jesse

39:32.250 --> 39:33.980
over at rosalie's.

39:35.730 --> 39:37.360
He wasn't.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.490
And rosalie, she was passed out.

39:39.660 --> 39:43.630
And i thought, maybe...

39:44.290 --> 39:49.340
maybe this is my chance to end this madness.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.530
So...

39:52.190 --> 39:54.320
i called jesse,

39:55.250 --> 39:58.870
told him his mom had a bad batch of heroin.

39:59.470 --> 40:02.150
I knew that he'd come right away.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.420
I didn't know he was gonna call his mom's dealer

40:05.590 --> 40:08.080
and have him come over, too.

40:11.050 --> 40:13.510
They walked up to the side door.

40:16.170 --> 40:17.740
The moment i saw them,

40:19.410 --> 40:21.930
i stepped outside,

40:22.480 --> 40:25.700
pulled out the gun, and i shot them both.

40:25.860 --> 40:28.010
For my son!

40:29.010 --> 40:31.780
After everything that i did for jesse,

40:31.940 --> 40:35.770
do you <i>think</i> that was easy?

40:35.930 --> 40:37.870
After everything that i did for him?

40:38.040 --> 40:41.030
After everything that you did for him?! Yes!

40:41.210 --> 40:43.660
You shot your nephew twice in the chest

40:43.820 --> 40:45.670
at close range without warning!

40:45.820 --> 40:49.110
Yes, because he was screwing with my son's future!

40:49.260 --> 40:51.030
Every sacrifice that i made, every...

40:51.180 --> 40:53.400
why didn't you move?!

40:53.550 --> 40:54.710
Why?

40:54.870 --> 40:57.680
Because miguel is a baseball star here.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.330
We <i>had</i> to stay here.

41:00.630 --> 41:02.890
Don't you get it?

41:03.050 --> 41:04.990
I was just...

41:06.330 --> 41:07.720
i was...

41:08.210 --> 41:12.110
i was just looking out for my son.

41:13.580 --> 41:16.430
Who's gonna look out for your son now

41:16.590 --> 41:19.900
between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00,huh?

41:20.520 --> 41:21.070
Who's gonna do it?

41:21.210 --> 41:24.870
All right, that's enough, detective sanchez.

41:28.070 --> 41:29.580
Lieutenant flynn,

41:29.770 --> 41:32.260
would you please take mr. Torres to booking

41:32.420 --> 41:34.820
and arrest him on two counts of murder in the first degree?

41:34.710 --> 41:37.120
????

42:06.400 --> 42:08.870
Is that really necessary?

42:10.150 --> 42:11.650
Okay.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.680
Yes. Thank you.

42:17.760 --> 42:21.270
Dr. Dioli wants me to come in for some more tests.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.880
She'll discuss potential diagnoses

42:23.040 --> 42:25.090
at my next appointment.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.470
I'll go with you.

42:28.620 --> 42:30.330
Okay.

42:32.210 --> 42:35.240
Look, i don't think this is life-threatening.

42:35.570 --> 42:37.540
Honestly.

42:37.950 --> 42:40.370
Your skin is tingling.

42:40.540 --> 42:44.060
You're having night sweats, mood swings, hot flashes.

42:44.220 --> 42:46.230
I think we both already know what this is, don't we?

42:46.370 --> 42:47.740
No.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.010
Probably.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.020
I don't want to talk about it right now.

42:54.140 --> 42:55.630
Why?

42:55.730 --> 42:58.690
If there's one thing my job has taught me...

43:00.780 --> 43:05.310
everything changes when you say it out loud.
